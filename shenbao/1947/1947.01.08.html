<h3>馬使奉召今晨國　行前發表離華聲明　謂中國已奠定民主基礎</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕美使館發言人康納士，七日晨宣布，馬特使業已接獲杜魯門總統訓令召其返國報告一切。馬特使已決定八日八時乘美軍專機離京返美。馬使於七日午十二時在行館邀宴我外長王世杰，司徒大使，及其私人顧問傅涇波，並的定共產黨代表團秘書章文晋晚往晤談。宋子文於四時自滬飛返京，五時赴馬使行館長談，據傳係爲五億美元貸款事。中外記者多人，本日往訪馬使，請發表臨行談話，馬使未發一言。旋由京滬記者多人聯名提出書面詢問三點，請予接見作答。是時宋院長適入內，馬派殷副官接見，宣稱：馬使返國乃應杜魯門總統之召，别無可告，故不擬接見，所提三題，亦不必作答。蔣主席夫婦特於七日晚在官邸設宴，爲馬使餞行。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山七日廣播：蔣主席今夜與馬歇爾將軍會晤，告以中國民主改革之計劃。在此以前，宋院長亦於本日下午訪馬帥，說明中國政府之行政計劃，並聲明中國國民黨還政於民一黨專政已告結束。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京七日電〕年餘以來，馬使斡旋國共紛爭，努力不懈，此次離京之後，將僅由司徒雷登大使代表美國，參加國共未來談判。如天氣良好，馬使將於明日偕同高塞上校由南京機塲出發，大的將取道檀香山飛返美國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕官方今日證實，杜魯門總統已電召馬歇爾特使回國述職，馬使大約將於本星期二自南京乘飛機返華盛頓。記者問總統秘書羅斯，馬使仍將回中國否？羅氏答稱：予不準備答覆任何問題，但馬帥回國係正式發表之消息。據官方正式宣布：「總統已電召馬帥回華盛頓親自報告中國局勢。渠或即於明日自南京動身」。</p>
<p>〔本報訊﹞舊金山七日廣播：馬歇爾將軍離華聲明，美方今日予以發表，聲明全文共一千二百字，據謂：中國政府即將遵照新憲法改組政府，馬帥以樂觀口吻指出：「一個民主中國的基礎，業已奠定」。馬帥言明此次和談，係爲極端份子所破壞，並痛斥中共之惡意宣傳，曲解事實，企圖引起中國人民及仳人對美國之反感與仇視。馬帥認爲祗有成立自由及民主之政府，始能挽救中國。</p>
<p>馬歇爾又稱：一年前國共兩黨在政治協商會議中所成立之協議，實係一種民主前進的憲章，足以奠定中國和平建設之基礎，惜國民黨中頑間份子仍思保全其封建勢力，顯無履行該項決議之誠意。</p>
<p>馬帥指出和談之最大障礙，乃雙方彼此間之猜疑。</p>
<p>馬歇爾復稱：「余以極坦白之詞句表達意見，此乃本人促使美國人民局部明瞭此項複雜問題之唯一方法。一方面，中國國民黨領袖堅決反對共產式之政府，另一方面，共黨亦坦白承認彼等乃馬克思主義者，雖最初可同意成立英美式民主式政府，但其目的仍爲建立共產方式政府。」</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕中共代表團英文秘書章文晋，七日下午五時許，應馬特使約前往晤談，章因年餘以來，在國共和談進行中與馬使時有接觸，特於行前往晤談近一小時許，惟馬使僅作一槪括之表示謂，一切問題待返美後再講。此點可能即指待報告華府獲得美政府之正式答覆後再定。</p>
<h3>軍調部人員談　馬使仍將返華　對華政策想不致變更</h3>
<p>〔本報北平七日電〕馬帥回國軍調部反饗，（一）軍調部政府委員鄭介民，對記者稱：馬帥回國，係向國會報告中國局勢，渠相信美人不致改變對華政策，調處人選亦無更易可能，因美國目前尚無比馬帥更適當人選也。（二）軍調部政府參謀長蔡文治，對記者稱：我前已聞及馬帥即將回國，故毫不感覺驚異。渠預測馬帥仍將返華，繼續調處，軍調部亦將繼續存在。渠否認軍調部即將取消之說。（三）軍調部共產黨委員葉劍英語記者，馬歇爾早就有回國傳　，但是六日接着杜魯門電報，即日動身返美，共行色忽忙實堪注意。以渠判斷，馬帥回國不外有兩種情勢促成：第一，是共軍最近在沭陽，台兒莊附近等處的勝利，會使美國政府感到用武力解決不了問題。第二，由於一個中國十九歲小女孩子被强姦，而引起中國令國性的大風波的事件，一定會使　國政府覺悟他們的對華政策，已經惹惱了中國人民。這次杜魯門召回馬帥，大概是要聽取中國局勢的報告，並重新檢討對華政策。其結果，不外兩途，不是更反加强錯誤的對華政策，便是對華政策作某種限度的改變。在答覆記者問題中，他認爲軍調部已經沒有意思，馬歇爾，饒伯森，都走了，只有我們還在這支撑，其實我們早就該　包袱走路了。他認爲現在還沒有恢復和談的基礎。</p>
<h3>馬使返國以後　傳將任國務卿</h3>
<p>對華政策或有更張</p>
<p>〔合衆社社紐約七日電〕據紐約　報華盛頓訪員雷斯頓今日稱馬帥回國後，華府方面將詢以中國局勢是否尤其長留華府，如屬不妨，即將邀其出任助理國務卿一職，更進而令其代替貝爾納斯為國務卿，因後者擬退休也。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓七日電〕此間消息靈通人士頃詳述美駐華特使馬歇爾奉召回國一事。略謂，馬帥與杜魯門總統，國務院及新國會各領袖進行會商之後，美國當將草擬其對華新政策。</p>
<h3>民盟繼續開會</h3>
<p>確定該盟仍爲政國</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民盟二中全會昨日上午舉行第三次會議，章伯鈞主席，會中詳作工作檢討。下午續開第四次會議，由張申府任主席，審查會就組織部份提出提案八個及二十八點意見，對於民盟之組織，有三項重要決定：（一）參加民盟者不論有無黨籍，均爲以個人資格參加，入盟後必須遵守民盟之政治主張及決議，否則請退盟，（二）確定民盟爲一實現民主之非武裝集團，（三）民盟之本質仍爲一政團，吸收各階層之民主份子參加，而非爲單一之政黨。</p>
<h3>國家總預算案</h3>
<p>下週可提國防會討諭</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕國防會三十六年度國家總預算案審議委會，七日下午四時於國府開會，出席俞鴻鈞，王雲五，徐堪及其他有關首長多人，王寵惠主席，根據參政會駐委會對總預算所作之審核總報告加以討論，其中一部份已予接受，一部份則將待核議，審議會至此告一段落，總預算案可望於下週提交國防會討論。</p>
<h3>國大蒙古代表　昨赴政院請願</h3>

<p>中宣部今分別舉行</p>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕中央宣傳部定八日下午三時招待外國記者，四時招待中國記者，地點均在國貨大樓六樓該部會議室。</p>
<h3>和談增加新困難　張羣昨約張君勵左舜生等長談　就時局多方面交換意見</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕昨日午後四時，張羣氏的同民社黨張君勱，靑年黨左舜生，李璜，在某處長談，就詩局多方面交換意見，目前爲社會注目之政府改組問題及恢復和談問題，均曾涉及，分析相當細微，但未得任何結論。張羣氏並希望日內繼續再談，外傳張氏日內返京說，完全不確，記者昨日午後八時走訪中國靑年黨發言人左舜生氏，提出各種問題，承左氏一一答覆如下：</p>
<p>問：聞先生已與張羣氏晤談，內容可見告吾？</p>
<p>答：所談範圍甚廣，關於恢復和談，政府改組及馬歇爾將軍歸國，均曾涉及。</p>
<p>問：先生對於和談看法如何？</p>
<p>答：繼續以政治方法解決中共問題，吾人素所贊成，目前雖增加若干新困難，但各方如能注重現實，則仍有解決之途徑。</p>
<p>問：關於政府改組，貴黨意見如何？</p>
<p>答：此一問題極爲複雜，有待於鄭重考慮，吾人認爲解決時局之具體辦法，實較參加政府與否更爲重要，正就解決時局之關鍵作細密之探討，尚無結論可以奉告。</p>
<p>問：先生對於馬歇爾回國感想如何！</p>
<p>答：吾人對馬歇爾將軍一年來爲中國之調停奔走，極表欽佩，並認其辛勤之努力絕非徒勞。中國之和平統一民主建設，仍爲友邦所重視，美國政策在技術方面容有若干修正，但基本精神決無變更，吾人基盼因馬氏歸國，美國更可增進對中國問題之認識。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕靑年黨。民社黨重要人負，連日互相拜訪，對時局及改組政府問題，交換意見，七日中午，靑年黨在國際飯店歡譙民社黨全體中常委，至午後二時始散，據稱：僅係「酬酢性質」。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕民社黨代表蔣勻田，六日由皖返京，定七日夜軍赴滬，參加民社黨組織委會。蔣氏今日曾訪晤邵力子，記者今晚訪蔣，請對馬特使返國表示觀感，據稱：馬特使來華年餘，其對我國之和平談判，業作最大努力，雖未成功，但力量實已盡到，故甚盼彼能再度來華。又民社黨代表　超與蔣氏同車赴滬</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕章伯鈞氏對本報記者泛論大局，認爲目前基本之工作，並非如何改組政府，而爲由政府盡心研究和談，停戰以及全面團結合作等問題。爲避免中國之分裂，必須另覓和談之新基礎，此則需各界人士集思廣益，提供意見，向减少和談困難方向努力，而切勿向增加困難之方向前進。論及馬歇爾特使返美事稱：馬氏因調停任務惑覺困難而返國，希望其離華後我國大局不變壞，中國人應自主的解決本國之問題，方爲上策。</p>

<p>據該公司發言人稱，飛機失事詳情，將呈報交通部民航局由專家研究，以判斷是非。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕通部民航局局長戴安國氏，定於今日由京來滬，檢查中國中央兩公司之飛行設備。</p>

<h3>美照會中蘇兩國　促開放大連港恢復中長路交通</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓六日電〕美政府認爲：現由蘇聯佔領之大連港，應即在中國管理下，依照一九四五年八月之中蘇協定，重行開放國際貿易，而殊無理由再事拖延。美駐莫斯科大使館已將此意用牒文於一月三日送達蘇聯外交部，同時並以同樣牒文交付中國政府。該項牒文內容如次：</p>
<p>「關於大連海港地位與管理，目前情形，殊難令人滿意，美國政府認爲：此事應即由中蘇兩國政府予以攷慮，以便履行一九四五年八月十四日中蘇協定中有關大連之一節。美國政府認爲：該港應即在中國管理下，遵照上項協定，重行開放國際貿易，而殊無理由再事拖延。美國政府深知此係中蘇兩國政府直接交涉之問題。但就美國一般利益而言，殊有向雙方有關政府提出此項問題之必要。美政府希望，目前大連方面之畸形狀態，能在短期內中止。並恢復平常狀態，以便准許美國公民訪問並居留大連，進行其合法工作。</p>
<p>關於上述各點，本政府進一步希望中蘇兩國能在短期內恢復中長路之交通。</p>
<p>中蘇兩國在大連及中東路問題所獲協議，如能在短期內予以履行，必能恢復遠東方面之正常狀態及裨益各方面之商業活動。因此，本政府深盼中蘇政府保證即能在短期內採取上述步驟」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕從國務院宣布：美政府已請中蘇兩國早日結束蘇聯在大連之軍事控制，於中國管理下對國際貿易重行開放，勿再延緩。自蘇聯富局於十二月十二日拒絕美國平民三人在大連登岸，並限令載此三人之美國海軍通信艦於廿分鐘內離港後，此爲　國官方所採之第一步驟。據國務院發表，美政府已於一月三日同時令駐南京及莫斯科大使將此項照會送達中蘇兩國外交部，蘇方限令美艦於廿分鐘內離港，係在該艦停泊大迎逾四十八小時規定期間以後，國務院官員認爲，蘇聯此舉係在其權利範圍之內，對於所謂最後通牒及限時離港之命令性質如何，不願加以批評。</p>
<h3>軍事需要不復存在　蘇應即交還大連　我對美方照會表示歡迎</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電﹞美國務院於三日照會中蘇兩國，希望中蘇關於接收大連之談判早日完成，實行中蘇條約，使大連爲中國管轄下之自由商港之消息發表後，京市各界對此極為重視。外部發言人情報司長何鳳山，七日午後對紛紛探問我官方對此事之反應之記者羣稱：「此照會外部業已接獲，惟王外長是否將就此發表談話，抑俟中蘇問之談判有結果後一併公布，則尚未可知」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社甫京七日電〕外部今日證實已接美國關於大連問題所提出之照會，並表示歡迎，以爲美國此舉可促進大連早日歸還中國。外交部長王世杰雖未直接發表意見，外部其他官員則謂：希望蘇聯即能聲明將大連管轄權依照中蘇條約移交中國。蘇軍佔領大連並無條約根據，不過因當時對日作戰需要，由軍事當局暫作權宜之計，此種軍事需要現已不復存在。中美蘇三國對此全部問題係與條約有關，無所謂爭執。中國希望中蘇條約及中美條約均能及早履行，中國方面對於美國照會，在莫斯科方面表示態度之前，暫時不擬有何舉動。按：日本投降後，蘇聯政府於去年五月廿三日通告中國政府，謂蘇聯軍隊全部撤離東九省，由此證明莫斯科方面認爲對日戰爭已告終止。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山七日廣播：美政府對大連問題採取强硬立塲，美國報紙一致予以好評，紐的時報稱：此次國務院之行動，已一反其原來之態度，恢復美國對華門戶開放政策，反對某强國自中國爭奪特權。</p>

<h3>水利會函覆董必武　說明堵口工程眞相　望中共以民意為重協助完成全功</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕黃河堵口復堤工程，旨在拯救豫皖蘇三省大百餘萬災民，及恢復廣大當庶之耕地。該項工程，政府爲應皖豫蘇魯各省參議會與人民團體之迭次呼籲與請求，始從事計劃並付諸實施，依照原計劃，第一步爲堵口復堤，第二步爲整理汎區，蓋黃水一日不挽歸故道，汎區即一日無法整理，亦即流離失所無家可歸之六百餘萬災民一日不能回歸故土。中央關念民漠，責無旁貸，此項工程一日不成功，即一日無以對豫皖蘇三省之民衆，且淮河因黃水侵入，行水效能爲之破壞，黃水一日不歸故道，淮河亦即一日不能整治，損害之重，難以數計。惟以黃河故道在輩魯境內者，一部地區爲中共所盤據，故在計劃及施工前後，中央希望中共能極力協助，使工程得整個順利進行，迭經主管機關與共方協商，雖有數次，獲得成議，詎實行之時，中共竟隨時隨地加以阻礙，致工程進行，爲之一再遲緩，同時已完成之工程，亦屢被破壞。乃中共代表董必武竟於三日分函水利委員會，行總，聯總，並於五日招待新聞界，報吿對此舉國矚望早日成功之黃河堵復工程，諉過飾非，企圖歪曲事實，當經水利委員會於六日函復董氏，希望以民命爲重，明瞭中央救民之意，助成堵復工程之早日完成。函中並指出近據報中共方面有攔河築壩阻水下行之計劃，是則黃河南北兩岸有隨處發生決口之危險，冀豫兩省亦勢將重遭陸沉之厄，因此該會特警吿，希望不致有此事實，萬一堵口後，竟有此種事實發生，則其後果應由中共方面負責。此外，水利委員會對董氏提出之四點意見，並根據事實逐項予以答覆：</p>
<p>（一）關於童氏所謂：「（一）必須立刻停止放水工作，並追究放永的實任問題，如不立即停止堵口放水，應即依過去之諾言，照顧下游數百萬人民之生命財產，立即撤退聯總協助黃河堵口工程之一切人員及物資器材。（二）由於政府破壞歷次有關黃河復堤工程之協議，致使中下游復堤工程及河床居民救濟，不能進行者遂五月之久，因此花園口堵口工程，必須推遲至五個月之後，俾能在此期間，依據協議，迅速進行中下游復堤工程，及辦理居民遷移救濟工作兩點爲限等語。」該會答稱：「查」年五月十八日，中代共表會同聯總行總及本會代表商討談話會紀錄，內戴之堵口工程繼續進行」。又山共代表提出保留意見，大汎前打樁拋石，以不超出河底兩公尺爲限。所謂繼續進行，當然爲不使工作間斷，繼續進行，以迄堵口完成之目的，蓋屬毫無疑義，除在大汎前始終保持不超出河底兩公尺之限度，以維持協議外，大汎以後，即不應再受此項拘束。目下堵口工程已繼續進至相當程度，自應及時完成，且黃沮區域，漫延豫皖蘇三省，汎區面積，二萬九千餘平方公里，流離失所人民，六百一十餘萬口　　湮沒或損害之耕地一千七百七十萬餘畝，農作物歉收每年達一百五十萬噸，豫皖蘇各級政府以及民意機關，籲請早日堵口之文電，如雪片飛來，即國際問亦多關懷此事，殷切矚目。中央爲拯救六百一十餘萬之災黎，恢復一千七百七十餘萬畝之耕地，及每年一百五十萬噸之農產，不能不求堵口工程之早日完成，斷不能因有人蓄意阻撓而放棄應盡之職責。至謂數府破壞協　一節，不惟中央辦理此事，從未拋開協議，反之，中共一再破壞　王墤石塲重要設備，及以武力阻邊工程及員工進入中共區工作，且據掠堵復物資，實為故意破壞之鐵證。</p>
<p>（二）關於　氏所謂「政府應付之工款，必須迅速付淸，河床居民救濟費之最低數目之一百五十億，應按照去年七月上海協議如期交付，不得藉口拖欠」一點。該會答稱：查中共區之復堤工款，依照聯總顧問塔德之建該，按照工作成績，計値付款，已於上年六七月間先後撥交善後救濟總署六十億元，代爲轉發。據上年八月一日塔德顧問視察中共區復堤情形之報吿，認爲邊區政府已得到充分之協濟，已付款糧足以償付已做工程之費用，大函所云，顯屬不實。至河床居民敎濟費，已由行政院核撥鉅款，由行總負責辦理」。</p>
<p>（三）關於董氏所謂「堵復工程六百六十億元之分配，應按照堤綫長短，工程大小公平合理分配，目前堵復局所規定之各項分配數額，顯失公允，我們不能同意」一點。該會答稱：「查堵復工款，應如何按照旣定計　核實動用，乃全以堤防之良　情形，工程之緩急爲權衡，中共區應佔百分之六十之規定，毫無根據，即上年五月十八日之協議亦無此項紀錄」</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>請中蘇實施關於大連之協定</h3>
<p>美國政府已於三日同時訓令駐中蘇兩國大使館，照會中蘇兩國政府，要求中蘇兩國實施中蘇條約關於大述的協定，俾大連在中國政府管理之下，恢復正常狀態。這個照會的措辭，非常溫和婉轉，並且鄭重聲明：『美國政府承認此一問題應由中蘇兩國舉行直接談判解決，但爲美國一般利益計，美國不得不認爲本身也負有將此一問題向直接有關二國政府提出之費任。』美國此舉並非干涉大連問題，顯而易見，自不致引起中美蘇三國間的邦交問題；且其唯一的動機，厥在希望大迎早日恢復正常狀態，當爲中蘇兩國人民所歡迎。</p>
<p>關於接收大連問題，我國代表趙公武將軍早已與蘇方進行談判，合衆社也曾一度傳稱，業已成立三項協議：（一）大連由國軍接收後，將闢爲自由港，對各國貿易及航運一律開放；（二）蘇聯得享受租用碼頭及倉庫之特權；（三）大連之行政權屬於中國政府。但是道個甚囂塵上的傳說，始終未能成爲事實。反而不久又發生大連蘇聯軍事當局拒絕美國記者登岸的市件，美國輿論界對此，雖極重視，但美國國務院爲珍惜美蘇兩國間的友好關係起見，始終抱着「息事寗人」的態度，不願此一事件擴大竟稱蘇聯之所爲，『係屬合法行動』，僅表示一個願望：『按照一九四五年八月中蘇友好條約的規定，大連爲一自由商港，應出中國管理；惟中蘇兩國政府尙未商定接收辦法，故大連仍在蘇聯軍事管制之下，美國政府希望其能早日議定接收辦法，惟仍承認此事應由中蘇兩國直接談判解決。』所以大連事件未引起國際政治上的軒然大波，不能不承認這是由美國態度開明謹愼所致。</p>
<p>拋開一切理論不談，姑就法律的觀點而論；大運早就應該由中國接收，開關爲自由港，對各國貿易及航運一律開放；而此事所以遲還未能解決者，實在毫無現由可言。據美國記者牛頓電稱，蘇聯對於中蘇友好條約關於大連之協定第四條：『大通在顧時不包括在基於一九四五年入月十四日旅順協定所規定之滴軍根據地章程效用範圍之內，僅於對日作戰時受該區域所設定之軍事統制，』另有解釋，認爲山蘇兩國現仍與日本在交戰狀態之下，須至對日和約簽字之後，始能終止。故蘇聯意欲保留對大連之完全控制權，並欲在大連保留軍隊至對日和約簽字之後。蘇聯對於條文的看法，係爲誤解，且爲不應有之誤解。實爲顯而易見者也。</p>
<p>第一，蘇聯駐軍大連，並無條約之根據，使在大戰期間，山蘇兩軍司令成立協議，允許蘇聯得利用大連爲對日作戰之基地，如此而已。現在對日作戰，早日終了，且將近一年有半，蘇軍自無須再利用大連作爲基地，更無留駐大連的必要了。</p>
<p>第二，關於大速之協定亦規定「對日作戰時」字樣，目下對日和約雖尙未簽字，但決不能認爲仍在「對日作戰時」。依照國際公法的規定，在日本屈膝投降之後，「對日作戰時期」即已過去，與「戰時狀熊」，截然不周；何况美國於本年元且起，也已宣佈「戰時狀態」已吿終了！</p>
<p>第三，蘇聯政府曾於去年五月二十三日照會中國政府，吿以所有蘇黨均已自東北撤退完畢，蘇聯政府認爲對日戰爭業已終了，當可於此一照會中，獲一明證。蘇聯還有什麼理由拒不將大連交中國政府接收呢？！</p>
<p>要而言之，中蘇兩國實爲遠東的兩大安定力，不論爲雙方本身的利益計，就是爲遠東甚至整個世界前途計，也是應該保持友好關係及通力合作的。中國政府所採取的外交政棗，也以此爲不可變動的基調，前年中蘇友好同盟條約的簽訂，中國政府曾不惜將旅順作爲　軍基地供山蘇雙方共同使用，作爲換取蘇聯友誼的代價，這就是一個最有力的證明。自此一年半以來，中國政府對於中蘇兩國間所有一切條約，莫不恪守不渝。同時並在歷次國際會議中用盡一切外交手腕，無往而不想中國眞能成爲美蘇兩國間的橋樑，使其媾通合作，不致分道揚鑣。蘇聯對於中國容有誤會，也是不應有的誤會。所以我們希望蘇聯能反躬自省，珍惜山蘇兩國人民間的傳統友誼，切實履行中蘇間的一切條約；苟能如此，不僅中蘇間的一切懸案，都可以迎刃而解；而且美蘇關係也可以隨此而好轉。我們竭誠希望中美蘇三國間的關係，能隨大連問題獲得圓滿解決而益趨明期！</p>

<p>美國第八十屆國會於本月三日開幕以來，各方即矚望杜魯門總統發表咨文，實佈美國今後在內政外交上所採取的方針。此項重要咨文，已於六日由杜魯門總統親自向國會發表了，共和黨議員對此，也莫不表示滿意。誠如共和黨參議員范登堡所說；「杜魯門總統咨文措辭溫和婉轉。爲共和黨議員一致所贊成，總統對於白宮與國會之關係所提出之論據，亦能言之有理。』共和黨參議員哈勒克也說：『共和黨亦願與杜魯門總統合作，使美國問題獲致公平解決，相信共和民主兩黨在衆議院內，必能和衷共濟。』由此可知，杜魯門總統的演說，在美國國內已獲得良好的反響；從此亦可預料到杜魯門總統在任期屆滿以前，不致興國會發生齟齬而在政治上引起軒然大波。這不能不說是美國政治前途的一種可喜現象。</p>
<p>在美國參議院去年改選共和黨獲得勝利之後，大家都在替杜魯門總統担憂，至第八十屆國會開幕之後，白宮興國會就不會相安無事，明爭晴鬥，恐不可避免；因此美國的政局隨時有發生波動的可能。迨至第八十屆國會開幕的前夕，果眞險象環生，爲了民主黨參議員畢爾波賄選共和黨議員主張驅逐出參議院的問題，鬧得昏天黑地；同時參衆兩院議長改選的結果，參議院議長由范登堡當選，衆議院議長由馬丁當選，共和黨在野了十五年現在終於恢復了它對於國會的控制權。加以新任衆議院議長馬丁在宣誓就職的一天，就率直表示：『美國現行制度，已使美國成爲有史以來最偉大之國家，美國政府當無容納偏袒共產主義制度者之餘地。』當時議員的堂聲，不絕於耳，衆議院頓時充滿了反共產主義及反羅斯福的情緒。杜魯門總統處於這種情勢之下，究將何以自處？當然是一個嚴重的間題，尤其是向第八十屆國會所當提出的第一個總統咨文，又如何措辭？更是一個難題！</p>
<p>但是杜魯門總統的咨文終於發表了，而且已獲得各方面的好評，這不能不欽佩杜魯門總統的政治智慧，我們綜合全文，歸納起來，關於外交者，有下列各項：（一）美蘇兩國主要利益有賴世界和平迅速締造，故美蘇兩國實應通力合作；（二）美國如能以謹愼及忍耐之精神，繼續與他國合作，則必能締造世界永久和平；（三）美國在經濟上繼續協助戰災各國；（四）在和平希望實現之前，美軍不能予以裁减，（五）美國承認奧地利獨立，並應向德日兩國明白吿以未來之命邋及共邊界；（六）希望原子能僅用於和平，使世界各國，咸讀其利；（七）美國應保持强大之實力，俾隨時擊退侵略勢力；（八）美國之目的乃在爲全人類求得集體安全。關於內政方面，也有下列各端：（一）白宮與國會應互相合作，俾通過勞工法，以防制工潮；（二）美國新勞工法，將確立談判及集體合同之原則；（三）美國經濟前途殊可樂觀；（四）政府財政預算，不論軍費如何應大，必能謀得收支平衡；（五）美國靑年應普遍受訓；（六）救濟參戰軍人；（七）籌請共和與民主兩黨通力合作，以免國家安全遭受成脅。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統在咨文中所稱各節，雖然沒有像故總統羅斯福所採的政策，富有遠大而崇高的理想，但是在實際上，仍不失爲中屬切實的辦法。在目前的環境之下，杜魯門總統唯有採取這種方針，始能獲得民主與共和兩黨的一致擁戴，戰後的美國也是百廢待絮的國家，「安定第一」，當前美國最迫切需要的，也就是政局的安定，要在平靜安謐的空氣中，設法解決美國所面臨的一切難題，杜魯門總統的咨文終算替美國政局獲得了暫時的安定。所以我們不能戴了有色眼鏡來批評杜魯門總統的咨文的，更不能遽稱美國政治在倒退中。杜魯門總統的成敗，要看他在民主共和兩黨共同支撐之下能否完成其任務而定呢！？</p>

<h3>蚌埠市的誕生　本報特約通訊員錢夢超</h3>
<p>﹝本報蚌埠訊﹞籌備年餘的蚌埠市，業於新年元旦成立了。晴麗的陽光，在蚌山淮水間照耀着，人們感覺得天氣特別的和暖，好像不是隆冬時季，市政府成立的今天，適値新憲法公佈，在懸旗結綵萬象更新的環境中，充滿二十二萬多市民愉快的情緒。</p>
<p>市長就職</p>
<p>揭　四項方針</p>
<p>上午八時，在晨光熹微裹，首任市長李品和假公共體育塲檢閱市屬各機關公務人員。警察，曁中小各級學校學生。十時，市府成立典禮及李市長就職典禮在體育塲與各界舉行的擴大慶祝元旦大會合併舉行，慶祝元旦典禮由第八綏靖區司令官夏威親蒞主持。十二時市府招待來賓，濟濟蹌蹌，頗稱一時之盛，晚間請由徐州來蚌不久的夏聲戲劇學校假華昌街維多利大戲院公演平劇，藉作招待各界來賓的餘興。　新市長就職後，揭　今年施政方針四項：（一）安定社曾秩序，（二）加强市政建設，（三）奠定憲政基礎，（四）發展本市工商業，此後倘若眞能按着這規定的標準，逐步切實做下去，相信蚌埠市一定會有嶄新而可觀的成績。</p>
<p>建設新蚌埠的口號，早已洋溢市民耳畔了，在籌備設市期間，確實有點表現，回顧過去，展望未來，對新成立的市政府，都寄予股切的期望，蘄企以新的作風，建樹一些成績，給大家看看。</p>
<p>漫話當年</p>
<p>全市凌亂汚具</p>
<p>談到蚌埠在籌設市政期間的建設，不外工務建設和公用事業，但都爲事業經費所限，未能充分的表現。據李市長告訴本報記者，謂蚌市在淪陷八年中，備遭敵僞的摧殘，收復伊始，全市是一種凌亂污臭破壞不堪的狀態，道路久經失修，毫無系統可言，並多未舖路面，尤感寬度不够，以致交通阻塞。淮河兩岸，尚無正式碼頭之構築，上下運輸，多感不便。市民在街內任意建築，市容頗不整齊。自來水未經設置，一般飲用水皆取自淺水井及河邊，前者水味苦澀，後者水色混濁，均損害市民健康。下水道亦無正式裝置，舊有洩水溝渠，皆欠疏浚，尚有少數地方任水流街市，臭氣四溢，極不衛生。電力廠因機器老舊，電力不足，僅五分之一市區可獲燈光，尚有大半在黑暗中，其他公用設備的菜市塲均付缺如，由此可覘本市的工務建設及公用事業，毫無基礎。自工務局成立後，即着手進行修復興建，並根據實際狀况，擬訂計劃，認眞推進，期於逐步完成新蚌埠市的建設。</p>
<p>修築馬路</p>
<p>並疏浚下水道</p>
<p>李市長繼謂：本市現有道路，大半年久圯毀，或未敷路面，陰雨泥濘難行，交通殊感不便，過去一年內，一面將舊有道路擇要翻修整理，計完成大馬路碎石路面八〇〇公尺，二馬路柏油路面八九〇公尺，中榮街煤渣路而九〇〇公尺，公園路碎石路面七五〇公尺，國富路碎石路面二四〇公尺，太顧路條石路面五五〇公尺，並修復市郊蚌懷路四·〇〇〇公尺，藍天路二·二〇〇公尺，蚌臨路八〇〇公尺，翻修市區道路共達一二·一三〇公尺。又一面開闢新市區道路，計完成中正路（即勝利路）煤渣路面二·〇一〇公尺，塡築土方二•九六一公方，緯四路九三〇公尺，塡築土方四•二五六公方，中山路一二〇公尺，塡築土方九，一六六公方，軍站支綫二三七公尺，民生路二四五公尺，計開闢新市區道路共長三，五四二公尺。凡無溝渠的街道，或新闢道路，均須增築下水道，因特擬訂疏築下水道計劃，以工振舉辦，於去年十月開工，迄年底止，計疏浚舊有下水道一，六四〇公尺，運出汚泥二千噸，新築下水道七八〇公尺。</p>
<p>培修淮堤</p>
<p>辦理防汎排潦</p>
<p>關於太市之培修淮堤和辦理防汎排潦，李市長亦曾有所報告，大致謂：蚌市沿淮一帶，過去原築有堤防，近年以黃水爲災，堤身多被冲毀，收復之後，即着手培修，規定堤頂寬三公尺，外坡一比二，內坡一比三，堤脚酌加一比五，計去年二月廿三日開工，完成東安堤五，三〇〇公尺，土方四，二五六公方，淮北堤九，〇〇〇公尺，土方三，九〇〇公方。</p>
<p>去年夏季，黃汎東瀉，淮水激漲，八月中旬，最高水位達二〇，二九公尺，打破歷年來的最高記錄，市區大受威脅，爲防萬一計，成立防汎大隊，搶救險堤，歷時三月，幸免潰決。同時為防阻外水倒灌市區，在老大街，新船塘，大王廟三處下水道口處，修造閘門，臨時堵塞。惟以陰雨連綿，西市區各馬路較低地帶積水甚深，經設置抽水車及調用消防工具，日夜排除，以資宣洩，而維市內交通。</p>
<p>刷新公園</p>
<p>切實整理電廠</p>
<p>本市中山公園之修築和整理，並擴充電力廠，李市長亦為道及，良以勝利之後，人口激增，為供應市民遊覽，先將中山公園內污穢清除，遂即修整園內道路，種植花木，整理門牆，碑亭，修建噴水池，改建公共體育塲，設置民衆閱覽室，爲紀念抗戰勝利，在園內建造勝利紀念碑一座，上下顧　各一方，磚砌欄杆一七六公尺，花牆一八二公尺，並加建臺階一座，於去年雙十節，舉行落成典禮。</p>
<p>電力廠在敵僞時期，原有完好機器多被運去，僅剩一部份舊機器，勉强發電，但因機器老舊，耗煤特鉅，以致該廠虧累日深，時虞停電。勝利後，爲維持供電起見，一面組織蚌埠市電力廠整理委員會，聘請本市有關人士爲該會委員，以期羣策羣力，共同維持，並修理內部機器，增强電力，一面籌建新廠，基准善後救濟總署，配售五〇〇千瓦汽輪發電機及鍋爐附件全套，此項新機，於去年十一月中由滬轉運到蚌，業已裝置完竣，預定在舊歷　節·即可放電·（元旦）</p>

<h3>美參眾兩院埠席會議席上　杜魯門總統演詞全文</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓五日電〕杜魯門總統本日發表告新國會辭，長達六千字，檢討美國現勢，謂美國如欲克盡其對世界的職責，「我們魷應使美國經濟社會和政治各方面均臻健全。」他繼稱：「假如我們堅持並加强我們原有的理想，假如我們與世界谷地苦於戰爭的人民共甘苦，那末國人的民主自由信念就將廣被大地，世界各地的自由人士也將加入我們，共同獻身這種理想。」</p>
<p>在論及國外事務，原子能，世界貿易和軍事政策各段中，杜魯門總統稱：</p>
<p>國外事務</p>
<p>達成我們國內目標的進展與我們對國外事務的舉措有密切關係。我所說的關於維持一健全和繁榮經濟以及改進國人福利的話，都含有極大的意義，因爲美國處於領導世界的地位。我們在國內所做的和未能做到的不僅將影響我們自身，且將波及世界萬千人民。假如我們要克盡我們對國人及其他國人民的職責，我們應促使美國成爲一個經濟社會和政治上均臻健全的國家。惟有如是，我們始能協助他國獲致和平因素，即政治穩定，經濟進展和社會進步。</p>
<p>義大利，保加利亞，羅馬尼亞，芬蘭和匃牙利等和的現已擬定。這些和約將於下月在巴黎簽字，其後即將送連參議院，以待批准。本政府對這些和的並不完全滿意。這些和約雖不無瑕疵，然而我總認爲它們當不失爲我們所希望於戰時主要盟國間所能獲致的最好和的。更事爭辯和遷延將長期危害有關國家的政治安全，旣深且鉅·</p>
<p>在討論這些和約的漫長歲月中，我們曾向所有國家表眼，說美國決不同意以摒棄若干吾人認爲永久和平所不可或缺的原則作爲代價而謀取解決。同樣地，我們也表明我們決不退而採取孤立態度。在將來討論德奧和約的莫斯科談判和未來日本和約會議中，我們也將採取同樣的政策。</p>
<p>和約遲遲訂立的原因部分在於與蘇聯獲致和約條件協議的困難。無論美蘇間有任何異見，然而這種異見決不能一任其妨碍如下之事實，兩國的主要利益均將取決於和平之早日締造，亦惟有在和平的局面下各國人民始能以自由男女的姿態返回生產和重建的重要工作。我們所最關懷的當爲促進集體安全，而非增進個人安全。</p>
<p>對蘇政策</p>
<p>我們對蘇聯的政策是根據我們對一切國家的政策所決定的同樣原則。我們祗求伸張聯合國憲章內所包含的國際公理的原則。</p>
<p>我們現在必須進行和平的解決。各佔領國應當承認奧國的獨立而撤退他們的軍隊。德國人和日本人不能任其對於他們的前途，抱疑懼的態度，他們必須明白他們的國界，他們的資源和他們必須付出的賠償。我們們不想管理他們的內政，但我們能保證　些國家不再披上武裝。</p>
<p>國際救濟</p>
<p>美國對於照顧因戰爭而變成貧窮的人民夏協助各國恢復他們的民族經濟，已盡了足以自傲的責任。自戰爭終止以來，我們運往世界各地飢餓人民的物資更多於其他各國併合起來的數量。</p>
<p>但是關於容納難民一點，我並不覺得美國已盡了它的責任。自一九四六年五月以來，難民之中僅有五千人左右已進入本國。事實上各個行政機關現正在法律和攤額的限制之下盡力予以救濟。國會需要以新的立法來共襄義舉。我竭力主張國會應注意到這一個世界問題，設法使我們對於這許多無家可歸的難民，能盡我們的責任。</p>
<p>國際貿易</p>
<p>世界經濟合作是世界政治合作的基本要素。我們對於經濟合作已通過國際銀行，國際貨幣基金團和進出口銀行而有了一個良好的肇端。我們現在必須採取其他步驟以重建世界的貿易，我們應當繼續努力，務使國際貿易制度不受各種阻碍的限制。美國已領導各國努力使原子能置於有効的國際管制之下。我們不想自已或任何國家集團的龍斷。我們祗求有充分的保證務使沒有一個國家能利用這個力量（原子能）以達軍事的目的。如果各國政府不同意國際管制原子能的方法，那末恐懼的影子將掩蔽原子能和平用途的光明前途。</p>
<p>根據一九四六年的原子能法案，在這個法律之下所設立的委員會有全權管轄我們國內的原子能企業。委員會的計劃，當然將遵照國會的願望而　軍事機關密切合作進行，但我竭誠希望原手能的軍事重要性將逐漸减退。我們期望委員會能使原子能發展成爲工業•科學和醫學研究之用。在原子能和平用途約有効發展中，寄托我們的希望：這種新的力量結果可變成各國的幸福。</p>
<p>軍事政策</p>
<p>一九四六年海陸軍完成了它們戰時部隊的復員。它們現在正維持我們對於國防和履行國際義務所必需的軍隊。</p>
<p>我們現在所生活的世界上，愛好和平的國家的實力仍然是侵略的最大阻得。當負有重大責任的國家忽略了維持履行責任的工具之時，世界的安定就會被破壞了。</p>
<p>在這時代，不可逆料的襲擊，可以在空前的速度中到來。我們想維持强盛，足能擊敗任何此種襲擊，從而防止之。在我們逐步走向較爲合理世界秩序的進程中，龐大軍隊的需求亦將隨之遞减；然而美國軍事實力的穩定力量在我們的希望完全實現前，不應削弱。當聯合屬下的集體安全制度已建立時，我們當願加入集體縮軍，然而除非這種制度已告實現，我們絕不應再度一任我們的實力削弱，俾免招致襲擊。</p>
<p>爲此，我們須有配備優良和訓練良好的軍隊，而且我們應能於必要時迅速動員我們的人力物力，以應國防之需。</p>
<p>待至一九四七年七月一日，陸軍將减至官兵共一百零七萬名。其中半數的任務爲佔領，其餘之大部將留駐國內，以支持海外佔領軍。</p>
<p>海軍現正支持歐洲和遠東的佔領軍。它的主要使命－必要時出而支持我們的國家利益－仍未變更。在一九四八年財政年期間，海軍（包括海軍陸戰隊在內）官兵將爲五十七萬一千名。</p>
<p>甚至在這個業經减低的水準，我們維持我們的軍隊也面臨着諸多嚴重困難。佔領軍僅够克盡我們外交政策所需要的職責。我們的國內軍隊已减至不能再减的地步。我們很願陸海軍完全由長期供職的志願兵組成，可是我們的軍隊雖已减少，然而自願入伍的士兵仍難適應陸軍的最低需求。</p>
<p>陸軍部曾忠告我，說端賴志願兵陸軍實力是否能够維持目前仍難逆料。數星期後這種局面即將明期化，屆時徵募志願兵運動的結果即將宣佈。陸軍部將就選送服役制展期結束之必要提出建議，俾使國會能於現有法規於三月卅一日滿期前採取行動。維持我們國家安全所需要的實力，是國會的責任。</p>
<p>發展已受訓公民後備兵也是我們國家安全所必須的。完成這種工作的上策厥爲普遍訓練。我已任命一普遍訓練顧問委會，負責研究各種計劃，俾便擬定一訓練方案，我並希望該委會的建議將協助國會和我獲致有關這種問題的決策。這種軍事建設的代價是實際的。現在有一個確定的途徑，我們可沿這種途徑减少我們的費用同時並能確保我們的國家安全，那就是建立一單獨的國防部，不久之將來我魷建立一單獨的國防部的問題與國曾交換意見。</p>
<p>國家安全不僅只包括陸海空軍。其範圍大得多；國家安全將取決於物價和工資的健全經濟，取決於繁榮的農業；滿意而且生產效率頗高的工人；競爭性的私人投資；工業上的持續和諧和生產；人民自由和人身自由－取決於一切左右人們道義和精神的力量。</p>
<p>然而除達成國家安全外，我們有一更崇高和更重大的職責。我們的目標是全人類的集體安全。假如我們能在諒解和互相尊重的精神下工作，我們當能克盡這種神聖的義務。</p>
<p>美國人民的精神能決定世界歷史的途徑。如果我們維持並加强我們所抱的理想，如果我們和全世界受到戰爭痛苦的人民分享我們的恩惠，那末我們公民對於自由和民主的信念將遍及全球，而各處自由的人都將與我們共同爲了這些理想而努力。</p>
<p>讓我們以意志和耐心共同做這件工作。但願上帝加强我們的信念。但願她予我們以智慧，使我們能領導世界各民族走上勉的和平之路。</p>
<p>國內問題</p>
<p>我今天還要向諸位報告國內的情形，並依照憲法的字眼，提議我所認爲必要而緊急的措施。</p>
<p>我並且來歡迎諸位魷任，同時和諸位討諭我們應取何種方法來履行今後二年我們對美國人民的義務，</p>
<p>我國前途的造形，其權力在於諸位的手中，也在於我的手中。</p>
<p>如果在今年和明年內我們能找得適當的途徑對付每一個問題，如果我們不顧一切困難而有勇氣和決心來採取這個途徑，那末我們對於人民，將達到歷史上空前的幸福狀况。如果我們繼續與世界國家熱心，忍耐而聰敏的合作，那末，祗要我們的隣居也有和平的意志，我們魷能完成一個有永久和平的世界。</p>
<p>但是如果我們要實現這些目的，那末國會與總統在今後二年內必須互相合作。國會中的多數黨和總統所屬的黨派，處於對立的地位，這在我們的歷史中，並不是一件異常的事。我是美國的第二十屆總統，在我的任期內，我的黨派在國會兩院中佔少數。</p>
<p>我很明瞭在若干問題上，國會和總統或許有誠實的異見。然而然的不同，對於戰爭的進行，並未引起重要的異議，而在戰時和戰後黨的不同，在國際關係方面，也未引起嚴重的異議。</p>
<p>在若干國內問題上，我們或許曾意見不一致。這個本身不足為慮，這在我們這樣政府的體制中是很自然的。但是意見不同的情形也有幾種，意見不同的人也仍舊可以爲了共同的利益而竭誠合作。如果我們不顧黨的利益而不以這種精神來解決異議，那末我們將把國家的安全作孤注一擲而毀滅了我們進步的機會。</p>
<p>國內經濟</p>
<p>在此一九四七年開始之時，我國經濟情形極爲樂觀。我們幾乎人人都有職業。我們全國貨物和服務的生產較戰時緊急時期以前任何一年高出百分之五十。一九四六年全國的收入較平時任何一時爲高。我們糧食的生產較前更大。在最近五年內，我們生產的設備已擴及每一個範圍。美國的生活標準現在較從前更高，當房荒問題能够克服之時，生活標準將更加提高。</p>
<p>在過去數月內，我們已把聯邦政府在戰時所施的緊急統制，已迅速撤消。其餘的統制僅爲保護公衆的利益而仍將加以保留。私人的企業必須有最大限度的自由，以便繼續擴張我們的經濟。</p>
<p>在我一九四六年十二月三十一日的佈告中，我宣佈戰爭和終止。於是若干臨時的立法和若干政權限也自動宣告終止。</p>
<p>有兩組臨時法律仍然存在：第一組是由國會命令在「緊急」時期內仍然有效的法律，第二組是繼續至「戰爭終止」時爲止的法律。</p>
<p>我將向國會提出建議：取消若干成文法，這些成文法是在「緊急時期」內繼續的。同時我將建議：其他在這一類內的成文法延長到由條約或立法行動結束戰爭狀態爲止。關於那些繼續下去的成文法，我極力主張國會迅速個別考慮每一條成文法，並在適當的情形之下取消這種緊急立法。</p>
<p>現在差不多一切戰時的統制都已撤消，我們工業制度的運用大半是繫於商人，農夫和工人的決議。這些決議的作成，必須眞正關心到公家的福利·商人，農夫和工人的幸福都繫於購買他們貨物的人的經濟福利。</p>
<p>目下我們經濟上危險的一個重要的來源是物價高漲的可能性，以致消費的公衆無力大量購買一九四七年所生產的貨物和服務。</p>
<p>我們都知道最近物價的增高抵消了我們不少工人最近所加工資的價値。農夫們發見他們收人的增加大部份已被物價的增高吸收去了。我們人民中還有一部份人他們收入的增加超過物價的增加，但大部份人沒有得到這樣多的增加。那些依靠固定收入生活的人，例如依靠養老金過日子的退職人士和收人比較有伸縮性的工作人員，像敎師或其他公敎人員等，已受到困難了。</p>
<p>爲努力造成一個健全而平均的物價組織，我們人民間每一個集團有它自己的責任。工業界不但須抑制物價的上漲，而且在有利的情形之下，還須減低物價。勞工界必須避免要求不合理的加薪，以免刺激物價的高漲。政府必須盡力鼓勵大量的生產，因爲有了大量的生產，纔能有良好的薪給，低廉的物價和合理的利潤。</p>
<p>過了幾天，總統將向國會提出經濟報告和預算的咨文。這些咨文將含有不少建議·今天我將概述五大經濟政策，這些政策我相信政府應當在一九四七年內採取的·這些政策的目的在於應付我們當前的需要·而同時提供我們自由企業制度的遠大的福利：</p>
<p>第一，促進勞資間的和諧。第二，限制襲斷和不公允的條例；協助小企業，促進私人投資自由競爭制度。第三，持續國內建設的進取性計劃。第四，平衡下屆財政年的預算並獲得相當盈餘以減少公債。第五，在戰後農業中，保障農民有獲得合於公允水準的酬報。（明日續）</p>

<h3>市參議會　熱烈進行　今日舉行第三次會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊﹞市參議會昨日下午二時二十分繼續在正始中學舉行第二次大會第二次會議，由各議員向警察，衛生，社會，敎育四局提出質詢，大會中對於衛生局垃圾車司機利用公車營私一案，引起熱烈討論，至六時始散會。各項米及口頭質詢之提案，均以書面交各該主管長官查復。又昨日四局局長因時間不及致未能口頭答覆之各項質詢案，將改在今日下午第三次會議時繼續舉行。今日大會方面並將對財政，地政，公用，工程四局提出質詢。</p>

<p>學校長爲待遇問題赴參議會聯合請願（本報記者）</p>
<h3>大會最高潮　一塲大風波　垃圾車營私舞弊　運蔬菜兼帶黃魚　衛生局長答覆令人不滿意　引起全塲一片責難聲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊﹞昨日大會快到尾聲的時候，忽然爲了衛生局垃圾車營私舞弊的事，掀起了一塲風波，頓時使會塲空氣緊張起來，有些參議員要發言又不耐煩，擴音機放出來的聲音眞够驚天動地。</p>
<p>參議員大發議論的起因，原來爲了王乃徐向衛生局提出了一個質詢：「市區垃圾堆積如此之多，而衛生局不盡力淸除，反而在每天淸晨，利用垃圾車在打浦橋至漁市塲之間裝載蔬菜，帶菜販黃魚做生意。衛生局淸除垃圾糞便工具設備購置費用預算要十二萬萬元，拿市民的血汗，用來做生意，實覺痛心。」並且還有照片作證。</p>
<p>根據這點，徐永祚姜屏藩等二十三位議員提出了一個緊急動議，為「衛生局垃圾車勞私舞弊案，請大會推派代表組織情查團澈查」。姜參議員附帶說明衛生局這種不法利益，每月可收到三千多萬元，同時用這樣臟的車子來運輸蔬菜，實有妨礙衛生之處，請組織調查團，並請張局長據實報告。</p>
<p>於是大家議論紛紛，有的贊成組織調查團，有的提議限張局在二天內調查報告大會，有的主張交衛生委員會審查。結果不是請張局長先來個解釋。四面受攻之張維（本報攝）</p>
<h3>張維登臺發言　稱為公餘服務</h3>
<p>張局長態度從容，踏上發言臺說：「議長，各位先生，垃圾車工作完畢後帶回來蔬菜黃魚，我們已查出過幾次，辦了若干司機，予以處分，這事實我不否認。這類事情，以前租界時代亦有。但司機待遇清苦，每月僅十二萬元，許多司機辭職的辭職，被革職的革職。有做了十多年的，我們總想予以寬待，新司機不熟，往往在倒垃圾時易於翻車。我們爲要給司機找倘出路，使犯法行爲變爲合法行爲，就在他們工作完畢後給他們二三小時的「公餘服務」，借車子給他們，用他們自己的汽油，找一點貼補，但本人保證局內任何一員都沒有和他們勾結的，此事曾在市政會議向市長報告過好幾次。同時絕對歡迎市參議會派代表調查，但司機如此清苦，請各位先生想個辦法代他們解決困難。」市長亦接着聲明並爲張局長證明，確曾報告過好幾次，但實在想不出合理解決辦法，曾請敎過周祥生參議員，但也因爲他公事太忙，朱獲結果。本人可證明張局長本身決無勾結之事，但這種風氣確是不應該的。</p>
<h3>垃圾車裝蔬菜　太不衛生</h3>
<p>顯然地，參議員對局長報告並不覺得滿意，邵永生對司機待遇菲薄亦很同情，但要市參議會想辦法解決困難則不答應，這應該是局方的責任。另一方面，局長旣然承認有此事，把情形也解釋過，調查團的組織似無需要了。</p>
<p>張中原想到一個實際而嚴重的問題，「垃圾車用來車蔬菜，每天都吃到我們肚子裹，豈不太不衛生，太危險了嗎？」徐永祚大不贊成局長這一種同情屬下的態度，他說：局長似乎公然允許屬下「貪汚」，那別的公務員都可以因爲待遇菲薄而「貪汚」了。「貪汚」風氣決不可不整頓。因爲事情沒有辦法解決，而可以「貪汚」，這樣下去，是否再配做中國的國民！</p>
<h3>垃圾車公餘旣可做買賣·市政府夜間何不作舞塲　姜豪提出質問路式導要求澈查</h3>
<p>張局長一語之錯，竟闖一下了大禍，參議員羣起而攻之。路式導怒冲冲的說：「地方長官准許屬卞「貪汚」，這不僅張局畏要負責，市長亦應當員責，這些舞弊的錢究竟如何用法？局長有沒有分到？市長又有沒有分到？這事非澈查不可。姜囊亦表示懷疑，他問：「若利用公家車子作賣買，那末，市政府的房子晚上空着不用，能不能借給市民晚上作跳舞塲之用或買賣小菜之用？市政府說話往往說租界時代亦有，外國也有，抗戰勝利後，還說這類話，這種現象實在不應有，否則，外國什麼都好，何不把以前租界再送掉呢」？</p>
<h3>張維再度上台　解釋誤會</h3>
<p>這時，潘議長發言了，宣布停止討論，請張局長再補充說明。張局長趕快聲明「剛才報告沒有說淸楚，致引起誤會、本人並未說明這種事情是應當做的，被發現的司機都經開除，在無可奈何中，始使黑暗中的行爲在靑天白日之下做，使之合法。但這種舉動確是不合法的。自已相信平生奉公守法，但淸道夫，垃圾夫三數千人，雖管理不盡責，但亦難以使之健全。我們組織了一個作爲顧問機構的「淸道淸潔管理委員會」即是謀求解決辦法的。</p>
<p>四位參議員·發言時表情上：陸惠民　下：童行白右：陶百川　左：馮有眞</p>
<h3>最後付表決　提交小組審查</h3>
<p>參議員中，亦有認爲不必把這事看得如此嚴重的，陶百川提議交衛生委員會審查後再辦理，議長亦宣布同樣結果，並說明審查意思並不是說就可了事。但王乃徐仍要調查這樣的垃圾車共有多少？舞弊收入多少？分配情形怎樣？</p>
<p>最後到了非付表決不可的時候了，結果一一八人中四十五票附議提交衛生委員會審查，但路式導堅持要組織調查團，再定對提交委員會審查的祗有十票。最後決定提交衛生委員會審查，原提案人亦可出席，開會時間已一延再延，到了六點鐘，一幕熱烈塲面，始告終了。</p>
<h3>市校敎師請願　要求提高待遇　大會商討決定交敎委會審查</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊〕市立小學校長聯誼會及市立學校敎職員聯誼會，昨日聯合向大會請願。經該會敎育委員會召集人童行白•局斐成•徐則讓接見，並由童氏向大會報告經過稱：請願者主要點在待遇太低，不能維持生活。要求提高。辦法中主要者爲向學生收取類似尊師金之敎師福利金，因關係相當大，無權答覆，祗能聽候大會作最後決定。經商討之下，決定交付敎育委員會審查。</p>
<h3>塲內菜販·亦來請願</h3>
<p>又前日第十一區塲外菜販向大會請願後，昨日又有該區塲內菜販數百人，亦手執紅綠紙旗，至大會請願，聲稱塲外菜販設攤於出入口，妨礙塲內菜販之營業，請參議會主持公道，予以制止。經唐世昌參議員接見，勸令雙方先　行商討妥善辦法融洽相處。文化藝術界之反謝，想各位已知道，現今文化界朋友托我傳達一聲，藝術亦為文化之一部門，在號稱全國文化中心之上海，不允許設立僅僅一所之藝術學校，未免太過份。現今一般國民學校缺乏勞作美術師資，藝師對此正有帮助。現有數問題請問敎育局：（一）撤裁一所藝術師範，究竟多了多少經費？（二）藝師去年全部經費，佔全部敎靑經費幾分之幾？（三）撤裁後究竟對國民敎育有利或不利？此並非質詢，而係請答覆。</p>
<h3>下學期　學費問題</h3>
<p>關於下學期學費間題，黃炳權問：（一）上次大會議決因私立學校收費太高，乃有限制規定。現下生活指數增高，學費亦將增加，敎育局對下學期之學費，是否已有規定？（二）木學期將告終結，各學校向學生家長收取留額金，小學自二萬至四萬不等，收去作何用途？事前是否得敎育局之核准或同意。女參議員陸惠明亦質詢對下學期市立私立學校學費，是否已有規定。又諸文綺問：敎育部命令私立學校辦理立案，前四分之一已立案，其餘四分之三至今已有多少辦妥立案手續。龔夏稱：（一）郊區學校少，失學兒童多，本年預算中雖有列入，但是否還可增加。（二）成人敎育之民衆夜校，成績如何，如辦得不好，不如撤裁，多辦幾個國民學校。陶廣川稱：市立學校敎職員待遇，在十二月份調整後，仍覺不能維持，目今高唱敎育第一，敎師責任重大，但爲生活不能安定，紛紛改行，影響至鉅。故望切實提高，’不能以公務人員來限制敎員之待過。王維　稱：電台敎育爲社敎一大問題，希多注意，上次參議會曾議決敎育經費不得少於百分之二十，原預算六十二億，見敎育局報告尚祗用去十八億，還望多多運用，以晋及敎育。</p>
<p>市參議員表決議案時情形（本報記者攝）</p>
<h3>不滿敎育　質詢紛起　裁撤藝術師範　認為跡近偏見</h3>
<p>質詢中關於敎育、局者，亦復不少。關於市立藝術師範撤裁問題，有兩相對意見：沈鼎稱：（一）上次大會通過請市政府令飭敎育局調整機構，節省開支，昨日大會開幕時，有市立藝術師範學校學生冒風雨在門前發傳單請願，本人見之，甚感不安。但事後細細研究，覺得此事敎育局應負責任。其理由（一）將市立藝術師範撤裁併入新陸師範，藝師學生仍可求學，且經費無增，此爲易辦之事，敎育局爲何坐視不辦。（二）敎育局卅五年度下半年度預算中曾稱將藝術師範維持至年底爲止，但見該局本年度預算，仍將藝師經費列入，可見自相矛盾，毫無誠意。（三）藝術師範中，藝術班祗二班，普通初中却有三班，爲何在藝師外添設附班，顯然抵觸敎育部法令。敎育局顯在意氣用事，從中阻撓。自上次大會議決撤裁後，報上即發現啓事，譏諷本人不懂敎育，文中大捧敎育局，實爲近年敎育界之奇蹟。本人上次提此案時，並無偏見，亦無故意爲難之意。</p>
<h3>請求取消限制用電·剪綫辦法決先停止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊﹞昨日各參議員以限制電力問題，紛紛向公用局長趙曾玨提供意見，汪參議員竹一告局長要求自二月一日起取消限制用電，並廢除割綫辦法。朱參義員扶九則希望局方暫先限制電熱，而勿予限制電燈用電，因年關將近，市戶用者：剪綫辦法扶決予取消，前日已通知各部人員停止剪綫。</p>
<h3>吳市長再提　交議案二件</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞吳市長昨繼續向木市參議會提出交議案二件如次；</p>
<p>（一）擬恢復全市路燈至戰前狀態，以應市民之需要，並擬添入預算中，請核定案。（二）爲本市交通擁塞情形日見嚴重，必須設法解決，除工程部門另案提會討論外，茲將最近所擬對於車輛及攤販兩項措施，提請公決案。</p>
<h3>陶百川報告　參加制憲經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊）市參議員國大代表陶百川昨日在第二次會議舉行前，向大會報告參加制憲經過悄形。略謂憲法內與上海市民權利有特別關係者：（甲）上海市民在新政治制度內之代表權，上海市參加國大代表可推八位，同仁等曾再三要求修改，依照人口作比例，但結果未獲通過。立法委員，規定十八市與各省以人口單位作比例，超過三百萬者每一百萬人中推一位，本市即可推六位委員。至於監察委員席數，直轄市產生二位或三位　同仁等亦屢次要求增加，亦未獲審查大會接受。（乙）上海市民在地方上之自治權，直轄市自治權未能得到憲法保障。此點陶氏會向市參議會提案呈請中央顯到市民自治權。</p>
<h3>尊師金　手續未清</h3>
<p>（一）尊師金聽說尚有一萬萬元以上之手續未曾了淸，請問該款現由何人保管？存於那一家銀行？利息如何處置？（三）師範生膳費問題，據本人所知，本市師範生共祗七百餘人，但敎育局之預算列爲一千人。而通常學校之膳費，每月每人三萬至四萬，預算中爲何達五萬至七萬？是否亦因包括了　席捐等在內。在座者聞言大笑。趙仰雄繼對藝師撒裁問題起立發言稱：上次該案議決後，</p>
<h3>上次決議案　多數未執行</h3>
<p>馬君碩對各局如何執行第一次大會之決議提出質詢稱：各決議案多數至今未能執行。據秘書處之報告，送交一百七十五案中，已有答覆者六十四件，未答覆者一百十一件。且已答覆者是否執行還是問題，未答續者更是莫名其妙。如此無交待，將使五百萬市民太失望。</p>
<p>吳市長當即對執行決議案悄形作答覆稱：自覺很恐惶，事實與書面所載稍有不同。六十四件係指已有結論而言，其他爲即將有結論或尚在進行。本人誠懇表示，決心忠實執行各決議案，決不推諉。</p>
<h3>對社會工商行政　多做些積極工作</h3>
<p>對社會局之質詢，，比較最少。陸蔭初問：在高利貸壓迫下，便利小市民之公典已有好多家設立，辦理成績如何？徐永祚稱：對於社會工商行政方面，希能多做積極之指導改良管理工作，少做消極之取締工作。朱文德稱：（一）本年郊區棉花豐收，但因廠商購用美棉，故不但不漲價，反而跌價，已瀕臨破產。社會局有否救濟辦法？（二）據社會局報告合作社已成立許多，但或績如何未管。據悉配給廠商物品時，多拒絕或故意留難。（三）日前爲靜安寺廟產問題，報上又見互相攻訐，社會局對寺廟是否加以監督。俞傳鼎稱：社會局舉辦商行登記，不劃分區域辦理，是否要發生重複？</p>
<h3>愼重討論預算　改排議事日程</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕徐參議員永祚等以審核市府卅六年度預算問題，爲大會最重要工作，必須詳細研討分析才可決定渠認爲上次審查預算，不够鄭重，故提出臨時動　更改議事日程，多加二次小組響查會，一次審查大會？專作討論預算。經通過後交秘書處排定日程。</p>
<p>又吳市長昨日與記者談及預算問題，再度聲明市府建設市政，人員不得不予增加，預算已竭力减低，但其承認：「實在因市面不景氣，市民感到負祖太重，否則也一定會覺得預算不太大」。</p>
<h3>江灣體育塲燬於爆炸　要求賠償損失　提請市府轉向國防部交涉</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞徐則驤等二十九名參議員以江灣市體育塲規模宏大，建築雄偉，在國內首屈一指。敵僞時期未被破壤，勝利後市政府未曾接收，由國防部佔用，此次因軍火庫爆炸而損毀甚鉅，昨特聯名向大會提出緊急動議，請市政府轉向國防部交涉撥款賠償損失，以維公產，而利敎育。經大會以八十六票過半數通過，提交市府辦理。</p>
<h3>提起攤販問題　一致歸咎警局　攤上貨品　任意沒收　歸公乎？歸私乎？</h3>
<p>質詢中關於警察局者甚多，涉及攤販事件，頗多批評。張志韓稱：上次大會中曾問及街頭攤販有多少，警局沒收貨物有多少。當時官局長曾答覆以不沒收爲目的。但至今每見警察任意沒收，車載而去。此當非警察當局之意。本人曾目睹警察坐吉普卡至四馬路某弄口跳下，向一皮匠擔拿皮兩塊，該皮匠在後要求能否少拿一塊，警察不理，上車揚長而去。吉普車上而滿載橘子及美國貨品等物。究係涓滴歸公，抑或涓滴歸私？如今一部份警察如要吃橘子，即至攤上隨意拿，甚至多餘帶回家去。陸蔭初繼起質問警局，違警罰鍰應每月公佈，以前不公佈爲何理由？又稱本市逢發生緊急事件，吳市長每親自到塲視察，精神可佩。宣局長則不能見到，是爲公事忙，仰或爲私事忙？徐永祚稱：攤販事件發生時，本人事務所與黃浦分局近在咫尺，耳聞目睹，見當局於初時操之過急，否則事情當不會鬧大。現今雖事已過去，但警政當局應負全責。不能爲整飭市容，而減絕小阪生計。爲此聯帶想及取締人力車問題，一取締，則彼等生計無着，如言人力車不人道，則內地之抬轎者與碼頭上之扛捧夫，應更不人道，是否亦在取締之列？希市政當局審愼從事。</p>
<p>邵永生稱：美化市容目前談不到，都市裝飾工作須在福會一般生活安定後方可。警局本年度預算增加六千多名警員，本人意可改用義務警察代替，以减少預算。但義務警察素質應注意提高。陸惠明稱：警局處理攤販事件有過份之處，以後應愼重處理。瞿鉞稱：警察待遇低是事實，長官應顧及够不够維持最低生活限度，設法如何救濟，或舉辦福利事業，否則流弊很大。而攤販事件之引起軒然大波，當時警局爲何拿許多攤販拘留，是否有未盡善之處？王維駰稱：上次大會議決，請市府在預算中列十億元供補充消防器具之用。並請市府商請救濟總署撥給機動車五十輛，以助消防。現市府報告並未提起，而實際上半年保警支出已超過預算，何以當用未用，其他反多用？諸文綺稱：據警局預算，擬將南市閘北之消防救火會收回由公家辦理。其實私立不一定辦不好。丁善明陸蔭初稱：上次大會決議撤裁騎巡隊，此次警局繳請複議，說明是何理由？丁參議員並稱：警局曾言騎巡隊壓力甚大。近日北新涇區每夜有盜案，騎巡隊能否前往該區巡邏彈壓？謝大荒稱：（一）市長報告三月來綁案破案者百分之百。最近郊區因淸剿土匪工作，到處打家刦舍，且公然拘捕人民。（二）登記經調騐之烟民，皆訴苦稱如過囚犯生活，希能注意改善。張志韓稱：水老鼠已由警爲拘獲甚多。據報告大規模偸竊案件中，警察亦串同溝通者。陳愷稱：自衛隊之組織，爲欲保護自己，並非搗亂，爲何警局不准組織。俞傳鼎稱：警局之戶口調查工作，共費十四萬萬，是否與民政處有重複之嫌。警局博物館與敎育局所辦者重複，似可合併，以節省開支。而警察醫院去年之經費共一億二千餘萬，全市二萬餘警察即有一醫院。但數百萬市民祗有市立醫院八所，故警察醫院爲應改爲市立醫院。女參議員仝道壞稱：警取務娼妓，特擬與社會局設立救濟婦女機構，期能在最短期內成立。</p>
<p>物資供應情形　外間嘖有煩言　決請物資供應局長出席報告</p>
<p>﹝本報訊〕參議員馮有眞等二十一人，昨日提出緊急動議：「請函請行政院物資供應局局長出席太會報告供應物資情形」，其理由爲：在行政院在滬設立物資供應局，顧名思義係以供應物資接濟民匱爲要務，而不以營業貿利爲目的，其理至明，乃該局成立以來，對於供應物資，尤以對於吉普車及軍毯之供應，外間嘖有煩言，多致不滿，有謂該局對供應品之取値、過於高昂，有失供應之眞實意義者，有謂該局對物資供應之對象全視其勢力地位及與該局之人事關係而決完者，甚且謂有以供應物資作黑市營業從中漁利者，眞相如何，雖未敢妄斷，惟本會代表全市市民之利益，對整飭風紀，建立廉潔政治，實負有神聖之使命，對於物資供應局供應物資之情形，如：（一）各項物資來源數最及原來售價，（二）配給物資之準與方法，（三）配給之對象及其名單，（四）有無黑市營業從中漁利之情事等等，均有切實明瞭之必要，爲特緊急動議，函請行政院物資供應局局長出席本會，詳細報告。</p>
<h3>帶隨員携資料　張維慘遭圍攻</h3>
<p>昨日議程爲對警察，社會，衛生，敎育四局質詢，各局長均帶同秘書，處長等大批隨員，携有大批資料到塲，靜候「被問」。敎育局並在會塲四壁懸掛圖表衛生局長張維慘遭「圍攻」。其他三局因時間不及，對質詢問題，遂得延至今日答覆。某參議員曰：」便宜他們多了準備」財政局長谷春帆，公用局長趙曾玨，地政局長祝平，昨日均到會作壁上觀，趙局長手執烟斗，狀甚悠適。</p>

<p>會塲所燃火爐四只，不見暖氣。陰雨凄冷，靜坐四小時，散會時皆呼雙足凍僵</p>
<h3>有關衛生事業　尚多改良之處</h3>
<p>質詢衛生局方面，除垃圾車搭客運貨外，姜豪又問：（一）衛生局爲事業機構，應側重醫務發展，最近不負担市立醫院之經費，而令自給自足，診療費提高，人民負擔增加，違背大眾福利原則。（二）就說世應與學校一樣，分佈各區，最近令集中合併，亦屬不合。（三）糞便問題，已爲公開秘密，過去經辦者有「大王」雅號。抗戰勝利後，政府曾改作由公家經營，最近聞言又要實行承包制度，殊屬非是。（四）衛生局將事業减少是否亦將人員减少。王離戰問：（一）去年防疫工作，平均每次注射人民不過全市人口百分之一，疫勢未擴大，不可說工作成功，只可說幸運，本年如何改良？（二）上次大會議決普設衛生事務所及牙醫診療所，刻僅見增設衛生事務所，而牙醫所則根本未見報告。查衛生支出，距預算尚有一年，何以不能推動？</p>
<h3>兵役問題　不同意見　徐永祚認為不必加以強制　費樹聲表示借此鍛煉體格</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於兵役問題，徐永祚及費樹聲二參議員，在昨日大會中曾予提出，但二位意見頗有不同，亦使塲中空氣爲之緊張。據徐參議員表示：本年度即將開始征兵，以前在內地見到征兵情形，慘不忍睹，不寒而慄，抗戰八年，人民痛苦萬分，希望能使老百姓休息一下，中國向有募兵制度，不必强制，非如英美各國因生活安定，不願常兵，必需强征。目前政府一面在裁兵，一面又在征兵，豈非矛盾？有人說當兵是義務，乃憲法中所規定，但現在憲法尚未實行，人民應得權利未得到，義務亦應慢一些盡。尤其是上海人民，在都市中生活過久，體格衰弱，招去服兵役，非少爺兵即老爺兵，未到訓練完畢即把命送掉了。國家征兵設備尚未達到，是不是要呌百姓送命？所以呼籲議長，請求暫緩征本市市民。</p>
<p>費參議員對於此點認爲不然，他說：憲法上規定服兵役，雖然憲法現在尚未實行，但服兵役乃國民義務，難道因憲法上應給權利未得而國家亦不要了嗎？同時如說權利未得到，那末現在人民所有權利是誰給我們的呢？若說上海市民體格衰弱而不能常兵，這實在是上海人最大的恥辱，人民體格不强，還配做中國國民麼？况且征兵並不一定去打仗”正可借此機會鍛鍊體格，不過希望民政處對於此事要鄭氣考慮，勿使流弊叢生。</p>
<h3>失事機旅客家屬　決聯名提起自訴</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊〕「十二•二五失事飛機罹難乘客伸雪委員會」昨日上午在新生活俱樂訓繼續開會，商討善後雪冤辦法，當塲決議進行步驟以要求懲兇已停止偵查，故決由家屬對中國及中央兩公司提起刑事自訴，將於日內搜集材料證據，並再召集全體家屬，撰狀簽名蓋章後，提呈法院。昨日該委員會並公議由各家屬出資十萬元，作爲訴訟等費用，並借樂俊偉律師事務所爲辦事處，決與公司常局交涉到底</p>
<h3>巨竊落綱　永興倉庫偷軍褲　海康輪上竊糖烟</h3>
<p>﹝本報訊﹞去年十二月二十二日黎明四時三十分許，有竊犯蔡洪生，李萬銀，李萬淸，吳萬元等四名，至滬東匯山碼頭對面永興倉庫，一人把風，其餘將實戶打開，倫竊美軍褲七大包，每包計五十條，運往惠民路桃元里廿四號磨才康家私藏。比至翌晨四時許，又往原處續竊六大包，擬再予搬往，不料行未數武，被駐紮倉庫巡丁發現，即棄　潛逃無蹤。嗣該臟物被水上稽查處取去，直至大除夕水上分局獲得密報，派警四出偵緝，結果將竊犯蔡洪生，李萬銀，李萬淸，吳萬元等四人逮捕。惟寄贓犯唐才康在逃，祗獲其妻朱三囡帶局偵查。據蔡洪生供稱是月廿九日下午五時，由唐着樂通和交渠美軍褲二十條，其餘均夫分得。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕水警局警長潘瑞琪，警士戴友甫等，二日淸晨七時許，在浦江海康輸值勤時，瞥見形跡可疑之小劃子一只，舟中載有三人，欲在該輪行竊，隨即將該三人帶局偵訊。始悉一名金小瞎子（廿五歲，揚州人，住龍華港船上）一名郭士榮（崇明人，廿八歲，住浦東張家浜路）一名袁春賽（高郵人，廿九歲，住浦東嚴家宅廿號）。據袁春寶供稱：我是搖船的，由金小瞎子郭士榮，還有一姓李的（現在逃），雇我的船，到海康輪偸東西，第一次於上午二時，在該輪上偸了潘烟一大木箱，白糖一蔴袋（約重一百餘斤），即遝到浦東董家渡。第二次約四時許，未有偸到就被逮捕云。復據金小瞎子袁士榮等供稱：贓物均藏於董家渡口一茶館內。水警局據報，即派警前往，將贓物如數吊出。據悉該贓物係江西路恒業里二號誠信昌行所有，擬運往靑島，現由水警局通知具領。</p>

<h3>地檢處　對保忙　案情較輕嫌疑犯　百餘人欣然出獄　大赦細則到後再補手續</h3>
<p>〔本報訉〕地檢處各檢察官因團府已下大赦令，雖大赦令之實麓組則尙未公佈，然為體恤各在押嫌疑犯起見，各自檢親所辦案件，擇其情節較輕，且極顯著在赦免範圍以內者，先准其交保出獄，俟大赦實施細則到連後，再補辦總放手續。前日准許交保之嫌疑犯共八十餘人，昨日亦准五十餘人，二日來已達一百四十餘人，法醫忙於對保等手績，迎日工作至深夜未較。道料今明兩日仍將有大批被告申請交保，然此並非正式赦免釋放，而為檢察官於大赦前之預備工作也。</p>
<p>昨日記者走訪上海監獄某負責人，承吿：大赦令頒佈後，覊押該獄內四千餘人犯中，普通案犯三千餘名，均合乎减免刑標準，俟奉到部令詳細辦法後，始能決定何者可以釋放，何者可以减刑。其餘七百餘名漢奸，則均觸犯大赦令乙條第一項，無减刑之希望。渠對報載首都地院巳釋放監犯三十除人，頗表懷疑，因詳細辦法尙未公布，無從遵循，想係罪經者先行准予交保外出。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕國府頒布大赦令後，各界咸密切注意，紛紛猜測何案被吿能赦免，何象祈吿將減刑。記者持走訪某刊法專家，據談稱，大赦為國家之殊恩，此次赦免範圍十分廣泛，除漢奸。貪汚逆偏等案犯外，全得赦减。唯大赦實施細則未公布前，對各案被吿命運，殊未便肯定下斷。如著名之糧貸案，照檢察官起訴條文，導及非常時期農工商管理條例言，確應列入赦免之例。唯該案正在審理過程中，審判官依法有權變更起新條文，若照懲越治貪污條例判刑，具不能赦免矣。近盛傳該案比院將宣告「不受理」，似無此可能。蓋所謂赦免者，因其有罪而需赦免，雖赦免後其本刑徒刑與所犯之罪，不能再加追訴，然與「罪嫌不足」，「罪行不能成立」不同。如考試法，律師法中規定，曾受刑事處分者不得參加高考，不得執行律師業務。此種消極資格之限制，極有利於國家社會，當不受大赦之影響。換言之，即有人曾因犯刑事案而被判處徒刑，雖經赦免，然仍不能即時參加高考，或當律師。因其人仍有「罪的痕跡」，在其消極資格上與根本未犯罪者又不同矣。地方法院査院長業曾一再聲明，各案審理仍當照常進行，即認為可望赦减之各案，仍須輕司法程序辦理。依刑事訴訟法第二百九十四條第三款曾經大赦者，應論知免訴之判決。故料法院對赦免各案，將應用此程序</p>
<h3>張校長　忠奸成謎　被控有漢奸嫌疑　證人說曾助抗戰</h3>

<h3>王仁珊審訊終結　包啓黃返京覆命</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕後勤司令部第一補給區江灣軍械庫分庫長王仁珊自行投案後，國防部即派主任軍法官包啓黃再度來滬審理。包氏於前日下午會同警備部滬東稽査處副處長嚴滋作初步偵訊後，昨日下午二時，再會同警備部軍法處長曾昭貽，稽査處長陶一珊，開合議庭公審，至四時許始畢。據悉會審結果，並無新發現，王仁垌之罪名除過失外，因曾一度畏罪潛逃，現雖自行投案，判刑常仍較總庫長傳濟民為重。包主任已定於今日返京，將審訊及擬判情形報由本案審判長秦德純次長轉呈最高當局核定。</p>

<h3>歐哈德間諜案尾聲　被告提呈有利證據</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕歐哈德間諜案之最後審結，日見逼近，譬如一塲冗長之戲文，羅鼓巳成尾聲。昨晨美軍法庭上，被吿方面開始提呈有利證據。其一係敵偽時期新申報上關於軸心協定之社論，論及訂約國不得單獨　和，此一證據之提是，其目的在解釋被吿之一，前德駐華新聞局長晋凱麥，所以與日方合作從事宣傳工作，係出於不得意。另一證據為普凱麥所繪前大西路三號德新聞局所在地之圖樣。又歐哈德本人擬提主信件兩封，證明其所供關於德國投降時之措置，但因檢察官方面認為此項信件不足為證，故庭上未予接受。今日本案繼續開庭，將由檢察官開始反駁被告所提證據。</p>
<h3>看影戲朋友　請暫留票根　影院正請減稅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市電影院業商業同業公曾全體會員，為要求市財政局依照中央法令減低娛樂稅稅率至票價之百分之廿五，向本市參議員呼籲援助。據稱：國府於去年十二月四日，公布修正娛樂稅法，規定稅率以「不得超過原價白分之二十五為限」，並「不得以其他任何名目附加稅捐」，而市府仍依百分之四十稅率征收，該會會員乃公決自本月六日起，自動　繭州修正之最高稅率百分之二十五代征繳解，並請市參議會賜予援助，列入議程，承認該會依法减率之決議。</p>
<p>該會會風並請本市電影觀衆保留本月六日起之票根，一俟市參議會通過本市娛樂稅率减低至百一分之二十五後，即將浮收百分之一十五部份，憑票根發還觀衆。</p>

<h3>市商會呈請社會局　奉行府部指示方針　職工請增底薪　應予據案駁斥</h3>
<p>市商會為各業職工要求增加底薪，違背府部政令，特呈社會局請予駁斥，略稱：三十五年九月，上海市政府施政報告，處理工潮部份有云，本年五月間，遵照行政院規定，成立上海市勞資評斷委員會，飭該會補行處理工潮辦法五項，其第一項為底薪不得增加，最近市長在市參議會第二次大會致詞，所述經濟危機，以高工資與高利貸並稱，表示對於一般工資問題不應採取殺雞求蛋之末策，深望工界不再設法提高工資。經濟部王部長，本年一月四日在第六區棉紡織工業同業公會會議席上，亦表示對職工待遇，應有相當限度。社會部谷部長，亦曾有制止增加底薪之明白表示，是主管府部旣有公允之方針宣示於前，即應忠實奉行於後。不幸徵諸近來趨向，似覺背馳，全賴主管官穈以第三者之立塲，公平裁制，董勸兼施，方能勉維危局，如果政令等於虛設，成案隨時司以推翻，則滬市工商業，惟有出於全部崩潰之一途，此僅時間問題，決非片面臆測。屬會職實所關，日夕悚惕，理合瀝情具呈，仰祈鑒核，凡各業職工，有以增加底薪，向資方提出要求不遂，假借任何名義，呈請調解或評斷者，概予據案駁斥，旣以維持政令之一貫，亦使工商業勉延殘喘云云。</p>

<h3>執行沒收逆產　政院訂定辦法　發給家屬生活費已有標準</h3>
<p>行政院對執行沒收漢奸財產應注意事項，及敵偽產業作價收款標準，近均訂有辦法，通令各地敵偽產業處理局知照辦理。中央信託局蘇浙皖區敵偽產業淸理處，亦巳接奉該項命令，原文分誌如次：</p>
<p>執行注意事項</p>
<p>一，執行沒收漢奸財產應注意事項：（一）漢奸案件裁判確定後，其應行沒收之財產數量價値較少者，即由該法院檢察官會同敵偽產業處理局執行之。其財產不在該法院所在地者，山該法院首席檢察官分別命令或囑託漢奸財產所在地之地方法院檢察官，或縣司法機關辦理，檢察爭務之人員，會同敵偽產業處理局執行之。共無敵偽產業處理局之地方，則會同當地政府執行之。（二）當地人或利害關係人，對於前項執行人員之命令，或其執行方法等事項，聲明異議者，分別依刑事訴訟法之執行程序辦理。（三）對沒收財產主張權利之人，所提證據，經檢察官認為不充分者，得論令其向地方法院起訴，即以原檢察官為被告。（參照院字第一八八六號解釋）。（四）沒收漢奸之財產，不合於第一項所定之情形者，得由該院首席檢察官分別囑託漢奸則產所在甩之用方法院，或縣司法機關之辦理民事執行人員，會同敵偽產業處理局，參照强制執行程序辦理之。受囑託之機關，不得拒絕。（五）愛更漢奸之財產，除參照强制執行法沒共他有關法令外，如估計其價値在五百戲元以上時，應運照審計機關　察各機關營繕工程及購置變賣財物辦法第三條，通知審計機開法員監視。但所在地佃。審計機關者，不在此限。（六）執行　收漢奸之不動產，尙未變賣，或依法呈准撥用者，應依公有土地管理辦法，移交地方財政機關管理之。（七）執行沒收漢奸之財產時，態先查明該漢奸全部財產之價値或數量。就該項價　或數量，除去其家屬生活必需費之數額部份，及應發還被害人之部份外，即馬孰　沒收之部份。遇該漢奸之財產不敷其家屬生活必需費時，免小執行。（八）漢奸家屬生活必需費，應根據客　需要，參照左列標準，於不超過所在地一般平民生活永準範圍內酌定。並一次發給之。（甲）漢奸家屬之範關，以漢奸依法負扶養義務之親屬及配偶為限。（乙）漢奸家屬生活必需費、以發給不能維持生活而無謀生能力者為原則。其有謀生能力而在執行時，尙未就業者，酌給三個月之生活必需費。（丙）漢奸家屬未成年者，其生活必需費給至屆滿成年時止。其己成年而無謀生能力者，推定其整個生存期間為七十歲，給以未來期間內之生活必需費。若執行時年齡已達或超過七十歲，或離七十歲不足五年者，其生活必需費均以五年計。（九）前項之生活必需費，包括衣食住及醫藥敎育等費，並在法律上不得扣押之財物。（十）漢奸家屬生活必需費，由執行沒收之高等法院或分院檢察官酌定之。其命令或囑託其他檢察人員或民事執行人員執行者亦同。（十一）檢察官得就漢奸之財產，指撥特定部份，以為其家屬之生活必需費，並就該部份免予執行。（十二）漢奸之家屬對檢察官酌給生活必需費之數額及其他有關事項，有爭執而聲明異議時，準用刑事訴訟法第四百八十八條之規定。（十三）執行沒收之機關應依懲治漢奸條例第十一條詳細公吿。（十四）本注意事項於呈奉國防最高委員會核准後施行，在施行前執行未完畢之財產，亦適用之。</p>

<h3>經濟統計專家李振南氏談　一年來之物價趨勢　各項根本問題未解決以前　任何經濟設施均不易收效</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者爲檢討本市過去經濟金融情形，並預瞻其前途開展計，昨特縐訪經濟統計專家李振南博士，當承接見，李氏首出示統計圖表，上列食米·麵粉·棉紗•生絲•黃金·美鈔·華股·公債等價格昇降之曲綫。該項曲綫，以民國卅四年十月爲起點，迄去年三月初開放外匯市塲爲止，此一階段間，各物價格曲綫，幾屬一致直綫上漲。迨外匯市塲開放，迄去年八月十九日調整外匯匯率時止，米價因供求不均，稍有波動，金鈔幾穩如平行綫。惟華股在六月中旬以前，趨勢上漲。此緣證交開業消息頻傳，及金鈔行市平穩所促成。八月十九日匯率調整後，各物價格曲綫，又告波動上昇。惟華股因受工商業不景氣之影響，反節節下跌。去年十二月初，因市而銀根緊俏，各物價格曲綫會稍稍下跌。惟迄該月下旬，該項曲綫，又復昇騰甚勁。故總觀一年來之各物價格曲綫，其短期間，雖或不無一時期之平穩。惟長期趨勢，仍屬上騰。李氏特別指出，在一國治安不靖，幣制不穩，預算無法平衡，國際貿易輸人超逾輸出之情形下，此項物價上騰之趨勢，殆屬無法避免。在本年度中，上述各項情形，如仍不能改善，則物似趨勢，短期間雖因投機因素，或頭寸緊俏之影饗，稍有彼折，長期趨勢，仍屬上漲。且在國內物價水地高昂，進口多於出口之際，我國國際收付，殆亦無法使之平衡。查過去一年間，我國平均每月進口貨値，約爲出口貨値之六倍。故渠深信政府此後對策，將從加强管制輸入貿易，以補過去管理外匯政策之不足。</p>
<p>渠稱：黃金美鈔俱屬不生產之物，而一般人仍競相　進。此項現象，可表示兩點事實；（一）對已膨賬之通貨，已失却信仰。（二）資金無出路。換言之，即缺乏有利事業可圖。渠又指出，在各項根本問題未解決前，政府任何經濟　政，往往不能推行盡利，且多屬利弊參半，今試舉數例以明之。施行輸入許可制後，利者在能保持外匯資源，及促進國內工商業。弊者在外貨不能儘量輸入後，國內之高物價水準，又無形獲得支持。中央銀行之黃金政策，利者在能收縮通貨，可使物價漲勢稍戢。弊者在同時能凍結民間有用之資金，使成無用之物亦非根本辦法。發放生產貸款，利者在協助工業生產。弊者在簡　增加市塲資金，又易引起投機風波。又如高利貸，一般人均深惡痛絕。然高利貸能產生遏制物價上漲之作用。故綜上所述，如國內治安，幣制，財政收支平衡等問題，不獲解決，則政府任何經濟施政，均屬暫時及割股醫瘡之辦法云。</p>
<h3>金價初顧後俏　外幣仍見平庸</h3>
<p>始赤昨更現穩健，晨開三五〇萬，開後並無特變，自三五六萬，一度破入三五〇萬大關，見三四八萬低價而後稍定，十時後央行以三五〇萬之似配給二〇〇條。此後供給見寂，散買紛紜，堅定逾恒，午刻後一委那，實銷仍殷，竟扳高至三五五萬以上，午後隔日交割買氣逾恒，上塲即躍升至三六四萬，央行被迫應戰，壓力重施，立見降低至三五四萬，最後稍堅，結果較前收漲起五萬五，飾金卅七萬六，銀元微升，暗拆銀根由鬆而濫，息似退至一角半以下。</p>
<p>外幣昨仍見平庸，晨初美鈔暗市報六千一至六千三，中途極爲平和，午刻隨金優扳高一檔，為六千三至六千五，午後金市雖堅，鈔市反有供源而未見帶高，賣買價稍予軋攏，喊價似低，結果較前收微升五十元，港票被電匯所牽制，未現鋒俏，結果較前收續跌二十元，交易稀少·乏人過問，廣帮有供少求。</p>
<h3>井水起波瀾　公債又活躍</h3>
<p>公債昨仍在蠢動，市參議會之助買論調，仍被債市大戶奉爲金科玉律，肆意拉抬，統丙晨開一九〇〇元有求，經陳某等領導下，竟盤漲至三千元關，始有六〇四室代紗花帮脫手，而回至二五〇〇元結束，較前收又升六百餘元，甲乙升五百元，丁戊升六百元。</p>
<h3>生絲收購　尚未足額　中信決繼續收購</h3>
<p>中央信託局，自上年十月間，代理政府收購生絲，至年終爲止，共收購生絲，總數爲六千三百四十五包，頃據該局負責人稱：關於去年收購生絲，因距原定數字一萬包尚遠，故本年度不論多寡，當仍繼續收購。</p>
<p>中央信託局易購日本人造絲，先後到滬已有二批，各五千箱，第三批已自東京起運，即可於明日抵滬，數量亦爲五千箱云。</p>
<h3>收購棉紗辦法　草案業已擬就</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府收購棉紗辦法，刻正由紡管會及六區棉紡公會分頭擬訂中。聞紡管會方面，業已擬就全部草案，大致對棉紗之收購與出售，均將委託紡建公司承辦。六區公會方面，亦正研究其收購之技術問題。該會今將召開常務理事會，屆時當有所決定。惟最後辦法，尚待明日紡管會例會中核定云。</p>
<h3>業中低價求售　紗市客銷沉寂</h3>
<p>昨日紗市疲莫能興，業中人不惜低價求售，如彩奎星等只賣二百零二，三萬元，然客銷沉寂，交易寥寥，念支以上各紗，又降三，四萬元，卅二支細紗去胃尚暢，銀月仍站原盤，五彩星八馬十全等，較前日行市亦落三，五萬元，趨勢依然脆弱。</p>
<h3>中紡配售花紗布　將更換新號證</h3>
<p>中紡公司配售花紗布之客戶，自新年起全部均重行登記，據悉二該公司定本月十五日起憑新登記號碼開貨，凡未曾重行登記之客戶，須於十五日前重行登記，領取新登記號碼，舊登記號碼亦自十五日起全部作廢云。</p>
<h3>紗布雜糧運台　美國木材抵滬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊﹞招商局海黔輪，昨日離滬開往基隆，裝去豆子二千三十餘包，豆餅七千餘塊，疋頭七百八十餘件，棉紗一百七十件，棉花九十七件。</p>
<p>又訊福來公司經理之非爾也威蘭（譯音）號，由可倫港運來本料五百萬尺，昨午抵滬，停泊十四十五號浮筒起卸。</p>
<h3>江海關加強緝私　海陸空兼籌並顧</h3>
<p>關於本市走私事，據江海關方面訊：該關在吳淞口雖常駐有督派人員及緝私船隻來回巡查極嚴，惟對軍艦之進口，確無法盤查，近海關對該項艦隻特別注意，凡行李物件在軍艦上無法盤查，卸下於碼頭上後，海關即可檢查，至飛機走私方面，海關亦以全力注意，務必撲滅此項走私情彩，至近來市面美貨充斥，據云：恐係以前囤存之物云。</p>
<h3>中信配售延期　人絲昨又狂漲</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲先平後昂，一二〇號高山有光，晨開三百十幾萬元，後因中央信託局第十八次配售人造絲以審核工作未竟而延期，消息傳入塲內，紛紛乘機抬高，喊價一哄而大，迄午盤做到三十五萬元，午後又高五萬元，比上日晚上最小價竟大起三十萬元左右，其他半光等貨，俱無交易，不過喊價亦被帶好十餘萬元，廠經市况平寂，普通五担開口貨昨做開價四百五十五萬元，干經零担，亦有幾担成交，價做三百十二萬及十七萬元兩檔，綢市與上日無甚軒輊，美亞被面廠盤二百六十五萬元，華錦縐上午做四百元，下午因原料提高，故亦喊大一百元。</p>
<h3>大衣呢頻跌</h3>
<p>大衣呢日來公茶會上趨勢，較之任何貨品爲疲弱，賣方零　手貨，無不步步喊賤，買方納胃愈少，行情愈見下跌，因銷出之日已晚，一旦擱存，俱須等待半年以後，雙方拆息有關云。</p>
<h3>花呢向榮</h3>
<p>春季可能行銷之各種花呢，不論西裝料及大路貨，其細毛綫所縐成者，來路和本廠各檔，邇來均皆轉漲，因鑒於今後定到艱難，呢絨各貨已平跌二個多月，一般有實在財力之店號，相率暗中收買，同時各家廠盤紛紛提高，遠路客帮亦互有問訊。</p>
<h3>台糖提早配售</h3>
<p>食糖近因市塲現貨軋缺，市價又告上升，聞台糖公司爲抑平糖價，已定本週四（九日）提早配售本年度第一期台糖，總額達一萬餘噸，仍採取無限制供給。</p>
<h3>配紗工作暫告結束　棉紗恢復自由交易</h3>
<p>第四期最後一次配售棉紗，六區紡織公會業於昨六日配出，並決定配紗工作以後不再繼續，暫告終止，至紡管會收購本市各紗廠棉紗產量之半數，及收購後之處理問題，均尚在擬訂詳細辦法，俟就緒後，尚須經過會議表決，輾轉需時，在此過度時期，配紗旣予停止，而新辦法又未克延續施行，但複製各業所需棉紗未便停頓，究應如何辦理，六區公會前曾請示紡管會，當經該會提交本年第一次紗價審議委員會議決，嗣後各業所需紗布，可向各紡織廠自由洽購，惟價格方面則、依照第四期最後一次調整價目，准由賣買雙方自由斟酌，惟市價方面，距離調整價不得太遠。</p>
<h3>油餅營業稅　財部不允免徵</h3>
<p>雜糧油餅商業同業公會，去年曾具文市商會，請將豆類製造之油餅兩項援例免征營業稅，市商會即代電呈請財政部籌核，茲悉財部已有答覆，略謂糧食業免徵營業稅之規定，僅以米麥雜糧以及加工製成堪充主食之粉類爲限，至豆油僅副食，原料業已變質，豆餅用於農田施肥，亦非食物，自不能列入糧食業範圍，所請援例免徵營業稅一節，未便照准，刻市商會已函覆雜糧業公會云。</p>
<h3>馬口鐵穩定</h3>
<p>新年後鋼板價格，復由一百七十萬漲至二百萬元，聞近有到貨，市勢已告平定，二六號馬口鐵價格仍上升不止，二四號市貨極缺，雙連及小馬口鐵價尚平穩，蓋以馬口鐵來貨稀少，而製罐工業及紗廠滾筒等用途甚大，故市况難期平抑云。</p>

<h3>倫敦透露消息　中英貿易前途樂觀</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電﹞英國貿易訪問團帶回之意見，雖尚未經透露，但僉信甚屬重大。據消息靈通方面人士稱：長期一字，庶幾能道其萬一，蓋短期之可能性，已因中國境內之混亂及英國仍患嚴重荒歉而受限制也。除此等當前之困難不計外，一般認為前途至屬樂觀。雖然英國無力以美金五億元貸與中國或任何人，（美國進出口銀行已撥就該數以備貸與中國，實踐一九四五年十二月十五日杜魯門總統聲明之「統一」政策）但英國仍有巨大能力與中國從事往來貿易，而中國所望者，無疑亦爲雙方之往來貿易。</p>

<h3>輸入品臨時管委會　辦理行商登記　寬放許可證限期</h3>
<p>輸入品臨時管理委員會辦理輸入品行商登記，迄止昨日，已登記者有四百單位。該會現正在進行審核調查工作，該項工作之第一步先請本市各銀行報告與各該行商之押匯情形，後再分別調查各行過去之貿易情形，現各銀行之報告書已有百分之八十送到該會。大概本月份可將全部審查完畢，至未獲核准力行商，將來一槪不准營業，已核准之行商對輸入品之細數分配，由該會委託該業公會執行云。</p>

<h3>社會局定期　普售顧價煤球</h3>
<p>近日天氣轉寒，且距春節之期已近，一般市民，對於燃料之需求，更屬股切，煤球黑市已自一萬元一担漲至二萬五千元，社會局爲消弭此項投機起見，擬定在本月十日（星期五）普遍發售平價煤球，每噸規定爲二十二萬元，零售照算，目前進行程序，由燃管會於六日於撥配之白煤屑裝運至煤球廠，製成煤球後，分發零售商，普遍銷售，以抑平煤球黑市，茲定今日（星期三）召開煤價審議委員會煤球小組會議，討論普遍發售辦法，將由零售商代表聯合辦事處呈繳名册，該辦事處現有會員一一〇〇家，經社局將各該煤球號地址發配數量登記編號後，通告市民，就近購置，原則上暫定無限制購買，但須依次排隊，九日爲各零售商號分區向煤球廠出貨，十日始爲普遍發售平價煤球之日，此次煤球數量總額達十萬噸，現燃管會先撥配白煤屑六千噸，故十日起絡續將發售之數量爲一萬二千噸云。</p>
<h3>細絲機不能紡製粗紗　火機棉前途暗淡</h3>
<p>〔本報訊﹞據棉紡界某君稱：上海附近各縣所產之火機花衣，其中以太倉所產者，品質較純。惟大多僅適於紡製十支及十二支棉紗，能紡十六支紗者，頗佔少數。然查棉紗之消耗標準，已由炟支紗時代，進於細支紗時代。故通常各紗廠產品，均以廿支紗以上者，居絕大多數。而各紗廠紡織機器，亦多爲紡製細紗之設備。故粗支紗所需之原棉量，遂告减少。據統計：第六區棉紡公會中，參加聯合配銷棉紗之卅六家紗廠中，其每年紡製粗紗所需之原棉量，約共十萬担。即以中國紡建公司而論，其紡織機器，允多屬細紗設備。故每年紡製粗紗所需之原棉量，亦僅二萬担。如爲該批火機花之出路計，必欲各紗廠採購紡製粗紗，則以細紗機而紡製粗紗，雖非不可能，然各紗錠無法開足，各紗廠生產結果，更將損失不貲。故渠稱：火機花今日之處境，實爲時代進步後所產生之悲劇。根本辦法，唯有從改良棉花品種着手，方克有濟。惟此亦非一蹴可就，亦須假以相當時日，方能使品種質量逐漸提高云。</p>

<h3>大專籃球女子賽　交大體專獲勝利　男子組南通擊敗同德</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大專籃球聯賽，昨日下午在市體育館，共有三塲角逐。首幕學院組，同德戰南通，裁判楊烈誠，李震中，雙方戰來生疏，犯規甚多，南通中鋒王槐庭，原爲仁餘宿將，然昨日在混亂塲中，有「英雄無用武之地」之慨。次戰女子組交大對大夏，裁判祝明星，交大前次棄權予體專，昨由陳陵親率各女將出戰，果然非同小可，慘敗大夏。壓軸戰仍爲女子組，由法舉院與體專，裁判張覺非，雙方勢均力敵，前半時法學院曾以十三比十二，一分之差領先。然後半時體專後衛死釘法學院投籃好手游德翠，結果遂獲得最後勝利。各塲戰况及結果如下：</p>
<p>南通學院首敗同德</p>
<p>首幕戰學院組同德對南通，同德宋煥章遠射，首開紀錄，南通王槐庭，左右逢源，陸桐高秉銘錦上添花，南通遂扶搖直上，第一節以十二比五佔先。第二節同德陳有民突見振作，三擲二罰，獨得九分，前半時同德遂以十四比十七，落後一球半。第三節雙方入於混戰中，各有所獲，最後一節，南通王槐庭球運大佳，獨獲十分，結果以三十九比廿七擊敗同德。</p>
<p>交大女生戰勝大夏</p>
<p>次幕戰女子組大夏對交大，大夏陳繡儉罰球首破鴨蛋，蔡國英繼之因罰得分，然前半時仍以四比十一遙落於後。第三節交大陸兆珊，射籃極準，每投必中，遂以二十四比七佔絕對優勢，結果大夏以八比卅一慘敗於交大。</p>
<p>體專女隊敗法學院</p>
<p>壓軸戰仍爲女子組，體專戰法學院，體專劉美琳因罰得分，首開紀錄，法院游德翠一擲鵠中，再射得分，體專隊長梅祖桐，情急得機便投，終獲二球，第一節體專以五比四佔先。第二節體專李惠芳，法院游德翠，二人你來我往，接連中的，博得觀衆掌聲不至，結果前半時法學院以十三比十二後來居上，超前一分。易陣再戰，雙方守衛森嚴，法院游德翠，身量較大，對體專之粗壯後衛，無計可施，雙方所獲極少，曾於十四，十九二度造成平手。末節開始，體專隊長梅祖桐緊蹙蛾眉，再三得分，天下始定，結果遂以廿九比廿二，戰敗法學院。</p>
<h3>新北大的瑣談　沙灘變了　（下）</h3>
<p>— 程靖宇</p>
<p>本來馬神廟一帶有好幾十家各省的飯館，當年同學們多寄餐於此。有江蘇的燜鯽魚，也有湖南的辣椒炒鷄丁，還有著名的張先生豆腐，現在只有三四家新開的簡單飯館，毫無特殊風味。</p>
<p>馬神廟的飯館　一掃記賬舊習</p>
<p>記得當年中山食堂的管賬老頭，每每好翻舊賬簿，在他向同學討賬不着的時候，便要嶗嶗叨叨說：「不要緊，陳公博還欠了我不少的錢嘞，他現在做了實業部長，我也沒有向他討」。這老頭我記得他帶的那副銅框老花限鏡，現在連影子也沒有了，他又那裹會想到欠他飯賬的陳公博這幾年來債台高築，最後以命相抵，還了他欠中華民族還不淸的重債呢？</p>
<p>現在的飯館全收現錢，根本沒聽說有記賬的事。七七以前可以存五塊錢吃十多塊錢還不算賬，甚至於暑假到了，沒有辦法，掌櫃的也多肯等到秋後再說，，而今大家都窮了，當年還有闊學生可以調濟，窮學生也可以欠賬賒伙食過日子，而今錢也變了，社會經濟也完了，就連道新開的幾家飯館的老闆也無從有古風了。</p>
<p>紅樓的老門房　人前暢談往事</p>
<p>紅樓一直的做了八年日本憲兵司令部，地下室裹不知弄掉了多少男女，北平人還讓言裏面有個機器磨子，專門磨人用的，大學收回以後至今下面還關閉了許多間，大家都說半夜有男男女女在裹面哭。紅樓的門房老楊飽經了數十年的奇變，朝代都換過了好幾遍，現在滿嘴的牙早脫光了，臉上增添了不少的縐紋，却還高興在人前談往事：劉哲當年怎樣駡學生，張百熙（一九〇一年，光緒二十七年冬，詔復興大學，派張百配爲管理大臣）如何的復興大學堂以及蔡校長那一年去歐洲，蔣夢麟怎樣來代理，胡校長剛來做敎授的時候，是多麼的年靑，他皆能如數家珍，尤其是北大後進成名的人，他自　是看着他們長大的了，也就自然的直呼其名：『傳斯年，顧頡剛，陶希聖，還有現在中央院的勞榦，不都是咱們這兒出去的麼？從先第一個女先生是陳衡哲，也有好些年不見她了。現在女學生這們多，女先生也有好幾位，不希罕，記得頂頭一回有女生，辜老爺（按即辜鴻銘）直嚇的問是那兒來的堂客，民國頭幾年在這兒當文科學長的陳獨秀，聽說也在前些年死啦。唉！日子眞快！我也不成了……』他唏噓起來了，額上的縐紋也更顯露了出來，一行行記載着北犬校史，接着他說：『周作人聽說判了十四年，可是錢稻孫怎麼只判了十年？他可擄足了，老跟日本人拘搭，不用說啦……』</p>
<p>沙灘變了，北平也窮了，大家身上都只有不多的幾張不値錢的花紙，現在的學生們連一百塊的小報也不大買了，那賣報的孩子們到了下午還站在紅樓門口嚷嚷：『上百塊賣您兩張！一百塊買大張報瞧！買張……』像利刃一樣的寒風，把他們沒精打彩的呼聲刺斷了，失去了以前的許多可愛的風光，沙灘變得平凡了。</p>
<h3>台灣體育近況　台省體育會林總幹事談話</h3>
<p>〔本報訊﹞台灣光復，一切均積極從事於改造與建設，體育一項，更不遺餘力。唯過去淪陷時，一般靑年受日本武士道精神之薰染，以致造成體育皆含有侵略之色彩，該省體育會總幹事林朝權君，於日前來滬，一面觀摩，一面接洽體育用品事宜，因爲合灣各地體育塲地等設備，極爲完善，而於光復後，最感缺乏者，就是體育用品，故希望滬地體育用品公司多多援助。</p>
<p>體育活動</p>
<p>林君住哈同路一七八弄Ｃ三號，昨晨記者走訪，談及台灣體育近况，林君表示台灣體育活動，以棒球·游泳•田徑·及橄欖球爲最，或將於明年第七屆全國運動會中一顯身手。至於足籃球則較差，然合地靑年體質較强好動，一經訓練，可易於達到永準。</p>
<p>體育精神</p>
<p>總之，台省運動風氣極盛，所差欠者，即為精神問題，所以很希望內地各體育團體，以老大哥的姿態，到台灣去給他們一點新的認識。渠稱，日前曾與精武體育會負責人商談，希望該會拳擊班出征台灣，因爲台灣在淪陷時，曾有拳擊對抗日本及菲律賓等地，水準亦相當高，故極希望相互切磋，以求進步，除此之外，更希望推動具有民族意識之國術，以代日本之武士道，唯該地極缺乏國術師資，切盼內地國術家前往提倡。</p>
<p>體育新聞</p>
<p>再談及體育新聞，在台灣報紙很多，然沒有體育之報導，因該地記者對於國文修養很差，而內地赴合記者，又不善此項報導。渠稱：該會顧間林宗賢參政員，將主辦中外日報，定二月初發刋，內容將以體育為主，希望與內地各報交換，並援助之。</p>

<h3>國內戰熖中　提出一個嚴重現實問題</h3>
<p>— 十二月廿八日航訊　本報濟南特派員麗天</p>
<p>除非國共眞正和顧合作，軍隊國家化，否則，未來國內戰事的推移，由於地形，物產，人文，歷史，諸因素，山東可能成為北伐後抗戰前江西第二，它將是共軍最堅強同時也是最後的一個根據地。在國內戰局中，山東的得失，賦有決定性的作用。</p>
<p>同時，要說明的：記者寫此文，絕不是宣傳或標榜「反共」，只就國內戰事未來演變的可能趨勢，加以客觀的分析，俾助讀者對國內戰局獲一更深切的了解而已。</p>
<p>三種看法</p>
<p>談到國內戰事，就記者所接觸到的中外將領，歸納起來，不外下列三種潘法：（一）在馬司斡旋下國共終於和平合作，齊心協力，共建統一民主富强康樂的新中國，（二）共軍終被國軍消滅或解體；（三）戰事雖互有消長或共軍主力之大部雖被國軍消滅，然並不能對共軍作根本而澈底的殲滅，國共之戰，只有直延長至第三次世界大戰爆發後算總賬。</p>
<p>關於第一種看法，凡是熟悉內性者，多認爲即非「幻想」，至少也是「奇蹟」關於第二種看法，要以政府對政洽是否能力求進步及戰略上之運用是否週密合宜以爲斷；關於第三種也是最後一種的看法，一般人都認爲公算最大，但果眞必須被迫走上這條路時，我四億炎黃子孫也將遭遇到一種難以設的命遝了。</p>
<p>戰局地位</p>
<p>在軍事觀察家的眼光中，旣認爲第一種的可能簡直是奇蹟，這樣，今後國內戰局無論走上第二或第三條路，山東在國內戰局中的地位，自皆有値得充分認識的必要　在兵要地理上，山東不僅是位居全國之中，且山東半島深人海中，與遼柬半島互成犄角，小航即達，因此山東不僅是華北的命脈，並且是控制東北九省的唯一基地。地理專家翁文灝先生之所以獨主建都濟南，不是沒有他獨到的見地和根據的。</p>
<p>除地理因素外，在物產方面，山東的大豆在全國中僅次於東北，棉產僅次於陝西，麥米及雜糧等足供全省人民之用而有餘；地下蘊藏如煤鐵等在全國中亦佔第三四位。在人文方面：「燕趙多慷慨悲歌之士」，山東人素以吃苦耐勞，豪邁質直，守信重義，著稱於世，且體格强健，身材魁偉，爲將則多良將，爲兵則爲好兵，三千八百萬人口中，至少可以出五百萬最優秀的兵，以淺薄低能如劉珍年韓復渠之輩，尚能盤據山東如此旣長且久，山東本身內在條件之優厚，就可想見一斑了！</p>
<p>再就共軍在山東之歷史與他們在國內各主要根據地之優劣分析言之：陝北雖爲共軍之心臟，經營最久，兵力最强，然因地春民貧，且四面受敵，國軍等發動攻勢，共軍勢難久守。東北松花江以北地區雖因地降邊陲，易得外援，但因位置過偏，對整個國內局勢，殊鮮作用，加以該很據地係抗戰勝利後始着手經營，時間短暫，基礎未固，國軍等及早攻擊，摧毀亦易。其他如晉冀察邊區，陝甘寗邊區，冀魯豫邊區，蘇北軍區等，在戰略上皆係四面受敵之地，敉平亦不難，只有山東軍區，地當中國心臟，山東半島深入海中，沂濛勞山等山脈綿亙起伏於其間，地形錯綜複雜，共軍自稱經營前後達入年，根深蒂固，加以烟台龍口與旅大僅一水之隔，易得外援，因此山東便成爲共軍最優良同時也可能守得最久的根據地，山東之得失，在國內戰局中，也便有決定性作川。</p>
<p>對峙形勢</p>
<p>山東共計一〇七縣，三普通市，一特別市。截至記者執筆寫本文為止，完全在國軍手中者計卅四縣，一普通市，（濟南）一特別市（靑島）。其餘尚有十五個縣係國共各半。政府所掌握部份，除魯南之十四縣外，其餘廿縣二市皆係膠濟路兩側平均的卅公里之走廊地帶。走廊地帶對共軍言，自熱是它的心腹之患。因此，在它自稱經營八年，擁有民兵一百二十萬，正規軍四十萬的今天，仍戰戰兢兢，一再擴軍，最近又擴充了兩個師，凡男在十六至五十歲，女年在十六至四十歲，無不在強拉暴征之列，可知企圖固不在小。</p>
<p>目下政府軍，因受停戰令約束，軍事上處處居被動地位，而共軍則調兵遺將，積草屯糧，襲擊膠濟綫我走廊地區的部署着着進行，山東的戰事眼看將隨着新年的到來而復趨熾烈了！</p>
<p>往何處去</p>
<p>不管共軍在山東目下是怎樣忙着作進攻膠濟走廊的部署：冀魯豫邊區的最高指揮官劉伯誠移駐德州，新四軍軍長山東軍區的最高負責人陳毅自蘇北之竄回臨沂，（山束「解放區」之最高司令塔）。總之共軍客觀的力量與可能爲另一問題，而其主觀的要求是希望把山東作爲它的最强有力的基地以等待着有利時機與形勢的到來。</p>
<p>放眼全局，蘇北的殘餘共軍於無法立足時其最大的尾閭爲山東，將來冀魯豫邊區，普冀察邊區，晋察綏邊區，陝甘寗邊區，甚至東北南部共軍在其各根據地無法存在時都將流竄到山東而以山東爲其最後的也是最大的根據地。目下蘇北及冀魯豫兩區的共軍已在開始向這個方向流，這樣，山東不也就成了北伐成功以後抗戰軍興以前的江西第二嗎？</p>
<p>事實擺在面前：山東爲共軍所必守，政府假使被迫着不得不憑武力解決國內問題時，還是先用最大的力量「攻其所必守」，先解決山東的共軍呢？還是養癰貽患，坐令共軍在山東強大而眞的演成遠較江西爲嚴重的局面呢？這問題有繫於國家的前途，而担子則落在王兼主席的雙肩，這遠較傅作義將軍過去所担負的尤爲沉重的担子。</p>
<h3>淮泗千里</h3>
<p>— 一月五日訊　朱振聲</p>
<p>淮泗徐海之閒，鑒沛蕭碭之上，遠之如漢高起自豐沛項王籍隷宿遷，韓信生長淮上；近之如顧祝同，韓德勤之出於漣泗；王懋功，王敬久，王仲廉之生於蕭碭，不是創業的明君聖主，就是定國的忠臣良將。但在南宋與淸季，江淮高寳先遭雜襖李全之亂，蘇松常太，復經洪羊革命之役，使生靈塗炭，民不聊生·二十六年抗戰軍興，江蘇首遭侵陷，椎牛發家，擄掠燒殺，九年來更飽受敵僞蹂躪。日寇降服後，復擾於共黨，困於戰亂，使庶民無稍蘇殘喘的片刻機會，頓令號稱文物之區的江蘇，長期變成了人間地獄。作者八年參戰，十載未履蘇北，最近隨同王主席東成，遍歷八縣，跋涉千里，視察淮泗，爰將見聞所及，拉雜寫在下面：</p>
<p>淮揚道上</p>
<p>在一個晨星寥落，冷露凝霜的黎明，和省府各廳處高級人員七八人，隨同王主席由鎭江渡江，環顧金焦北固，矗立雄峙，波濤汹湧，大江東去。七時許抵六圩，乘預先備就的三輛卡車北行，兩傍衰柳稀疏，鷄犬相聞。過仙女廟後，有大橋四五座，或因年久失修，或因遭共軍破壞，過去不久，曾有一卡車滿載男女老小駛至橋中，橋斷車墮，四十餘人，盡遭沒頂之禍，葬身魚腹。故現在所有經過車輛，乘客都須一律下車，僅剩空車駛過，免得再蹈不幸覆轍。至邵伯入高郵縣境，該鎭昔這共軍盤据，國軍攻克時，曾經數度爭奪。高郵湖波濤萬傾，水連天，天迎水，運河兩岸，風帆點點，茅舍三五。沿湖每隔數十里即有一市集，內河小輪，已恢復航運，滿載貨物旅客一路裝卸，市面頗形熱閙，農村亦漸繁榮。國共談判，除軍事政治而外，恢復交通，亦爲爭議之一。蓋交通如不恢復，則復興建國，一切均等於空談，無從着手。車抵高郵縣，知九十旅薛旅長仲述，方移師此間，惜以征車匆促，未及一晤。掠界首入寳應湖，湖面較高郵湖賂小，車曲折行其旁，縱且遠眺，宛似行於水鄉。兩湖均產魚蚧，富水利，四岸田禾，盡獲灌溉之利。惟常有泛濫，不若洞庭，鄱陽之有利而無弊。午至寳應縣府，知收容有該縣第二區，因傷被俘之共黨蘆汜區區長一人，王主席特親往撫慰，同時給予國幣五萬元，幷囑沈縣長善爲診治。另以國幣三十萬元，囑縣府購辦獎章，獎狀，及少數實用物品，褒揚慰問該縣殉職自衛隊隊員家屬，使生有所慰，死有所安。下午續行，車驎驎，馬蕭蕭，時鹽城，漣水戰事方殷，沿途軍運頻繁，傍晚掠淮安，黃昏入淮陰城。</p>
<p>淮陰城區</p>
<p>淮陰一稱淸江浦，居淮水之陰，處洪澤湖之東，毘隣安徽，爲過去運糧要道，淸置糟運總督府，民初置兩淮鹽運使，五十年前北門沿河兩岸，高樓大厦，連綿十里。惟自海運暢通，津浦鐵路築成後，日趨衰落，已無復當年盛况矣。淮陰淮安。漢時同稱淮陰，古蹟有韓信城，溧母墓，路下橋等，保留兩城，同爲後人低徊憑弔。去秋日寇投降，共軍佔爲蘇皖邊區政府所在地，共黨軍政要人，如邊區政府主席李一氓，與新四軍軍長陳毅等，均常川駐淮。去秋九月十三日，整編第七十四師張靈甫中將，於第七軍攻擊泗陽之同時，親帥五一，五七，五八三旅，分兩縱隊，冒雨强渡舊黃河，學破共軍陳慶先指揮之第九縱隊第二師皮旅，及特務團騎兵團，警衛營等約二萬之衆後，圍攻增援淮陰之共軍第五縱隊及新六師第一師第四師等。十八日我五八旅一七二團第二營營長楊勁，首先衝進南門，與先突入之兩個連會合。共軍雖在戰鬥進行期中，破橋沉舟，槍決了失利團長三員，以勵士氣，但仍未能挽回頽勢。經我七日血戰，九次衝殺，我劉普育，朱性侖兩營長，雖然壯烈殉國，但淮陰終於二十日下午兩時，經我國軍完全克復。俘擄了共軍官兵二千二百零二人，死傷逾萬。鹵獲輕重機槍二千八百八十六挺，大小砲筒六十九門具，共軍主力殘破，元氣大傷。現在蘇皖邊區政府，已經我們作爲江蘇省政府主席駐淮陰臨時辦事處，共黨佈置招待淮陰執行小組的地方，也暫時做了徐州綏靖公署副主任李吉甫——延年將軍的指揮所。其他如公園，新華日報，國民大會堂，都已經改建改造，然共黨遺蹟，猶依稀可尋。淮陰戰前全縣人中七八十萬人，業已泰半歸來，縣政在黃家駒縣長努力推行下，已漸恢復常態，惟因地處要衝，入晚八時後，即施行戒嚴，刁斗森嚴，猶有緊張戰時景象。</p>
<p>宿泗見聞</p>
<p>一過淮陰，樹木稀少，風沙撲面，儼然塞外風光；踏進宿遷，言語飮食，習慣舉止，便仿佛齊魯情調。宿遷是項王故里，昔霸王領八千弟子兵，崛起江東，大小七十餘戰，戰無不勝，攻無不春，威振四海。顧劇霸王別姬的虞美人，就是他的隣縣沭陽吳集人，英雄美人，雖千百年後，猶爲人艷稱。蘇北多寨子，堆以泥土，圍以深塹，形似土城，宿遷城雖不十分雄偉，但土城卻相當堅固。並有我徐州綏靖公署吳副主任悟生－奇偉將軍，坐鎭督師，堵擊共車的竄榎。街道寬敞，房屋整齊，表面還相當熱閙。惟據稱城鄉居衆，經共軍「鬥爭」後，有僅剩隨身一套衣服，五六人，七八人共一棉被者。泗陽經敵偽九年蹂躪，共黨數次破壤，舊城瓦礫一片，已蕩然無存。現在泗陽的軍政機關，和商店營業，都遷移在衆興鎭上。王主席途過揚州，高郵，寳應，都曾經對專員縣長等，面示施政方針。在淮陰，宿遷，泗陽等縣，更與七區紀專員毓智，分別召集各機關負責人員，及地方紳書，聆取報告，檢討縣政。訓示各級人員，一切施政，均應以民之所好好之，民之所惡惡之，配合軍　，迅謀恢復秩序，確保治安。一面舉辦農貸，工商貸款，提倡生產，復興農村，創設學校，造就人才，取之於民者，必須用之於民。同時勉勗蘇北人民，均應本有鈔出鈔，有力出力之義，保國衛鄉，爲國家謀長治久安，爲自身謀安居樂業。對於土地政策，亦應遵照中央規定辦法處理，對自新自首共黨，尤切忌藉端勒索，乘機敲詐。諄諄囑咐，語重心長。王主席是江蘇人，老當益壯，雖然已經是五十六歲的高齡，但猶戴月披星，櫛風沐雨，勤政愛民，脊肝國事，使我們這些年靑人與之同處，除了欽敬之外，感覺到相當的慚愧怍！</p>
<p>揚泰四日</p>
<p>遍歷蘇北新收復的各縣，財政困難，政費支細，是普遍的現象，經濟爲庶政之母，收支不敷，一切應興應革事宜，固不能放手去做。但爲政在人，縣區鄉保是行政的基層，然而財雛才難，人才同錢財一樣的感覺到困難。大批的博學才智之土，都集中在少數的都市，而廣大的鄉邨却有人才缺乏，幹部不數之感。我們要矯正這種頭重脚輕的政治上病態，人才應該分散到鄉邨去，到田野間去！楊泰是未經共軍侵入的城市，便道經此，停　小住。曾經和整編第四師王師長作華，容副師長有略，去遊玩了史可法衣冠塚，和平山堂，瘦西湖等揚州名勝。感慨於崇禎末年，流寇張獻忠，李自成輩侵陷京師，吳三桂引來了淸兵，史閣部能以明末孤臣，死守揚州。「數點梅花亡國淚，二分明月故臣心」。威武不能屈，當貴不能淫，國亡自殉，與張睢陽，文信國同垂不朽。而所謂二十四橋者，則袞草斜陽，隋唐盛况，已　不可尋。泰州過去常整編八十三師戍守時，曾被共軍猛烈圍攻，幸經我李天霞師長奮勇擊退。現在由一零二旅梁勃，陳陣兩少將担任城防，城廂治安，近甚安謐。記者曾和陳鴻釗團長等，赴該縣盛產糧米的姜埝出走了一次，運河中停滿了米船，市上商業發達，米僅售三萬餘元一石，猪肉祗需一千四五百元一斤，生活程度較上海减低數倍，過去是共軍蘇北的糧庫。泰縣設有感訓所一所，收羅了近千個共軍俘虜，丁縣長陪我們去參觀的時候，這些俘虜，吃飽着暖很，正在出操跑步，生活過得十分安定。有一部份俘虜，因傷在衛生院裹醫治，據一個二十歲左右的俘虜自述：「他自己是被共軍拉了去充任担架，後來又被調當兵的·共軍稱國軍爲反動派，自已官長則稱指導員，士兵稱戰鬥員，士兵每月的薪餉，是兩斤猪肉，當連長的，另外加給一斤半猪肉，和國軍打仗，一天要東逃西躱好幾次。他自已的父母，還不知道他被迫當兵，更想不到自己的兒子，會負傷躺在醫院的病床上。他希望傷好了，能够回到自己的家鄉，重見自己爹娘」。誰無父母？誰無兒女？驅無事的人民於砲火中，於戰爭裹，侈言解放，高唱民主者，又如何能自圓其說？　國家經過了八年抗戰，創鉅痛深，力謀生息敎養，努力復興，埋頭建設還來不及。黃台之瓜何堪再摘？那裹還允許兄弟　牆，鶴蚌相爭，陷國家民族於萬刦不復的絕境？共產黨縱不爲國家民族打算，除應該替自己後代的子孫着想，何必一定要相見疆塲。國家的事情，儘可以從長計凝，仔細商量，化干戈爲王帛，化戾氣爲祥和，協力同心，共圖復興，使中國建設成爲一個富强康樂之國。</p>

<h3>新港船閘　試航記</h3>
<p>— 天津廿五日航訊　本報駐津記者李紹林</p>
<p>津沽運輸極端困難下，現在由於塘沽新港船閘的竣工，已經開始揭開新的一頁，雖然塘沽新港的全部工程，距整個完成尚遠尤其距理想的計劃尚遠，但是船閘通航了。這已是大沽口上的一個新成就，已足給津沽運輸以極大的便利，從船閘通航開始，對於出人口的船隻，海河口上的攔門沙已不復再是航行上的陣碍，三千噸乃至萬噸的輪船將都可以從大沽口外經全長十三公里的新港航道入港，三千噸以下的輪船，並且可以經船閘直接航行到可津。</p>
<p>接收工作　亂如麻</p>
<p>主持新港建設工程的，原爲交通部塘沽新港工程處，今秋改組爲新港工程局，剛接收過來時的新港，船閘部份的工程完成了百分之八十從船閘兩側伸展出去，是南北兩道防波堤，北防波堤全長一萬二千七百五十公尺，僅半完成了三千八百公尺的工程，南防波堤全長一萬六千八百公尺，有五千公尺已完成，有四千五百公尺已半完成，在兩道防波堤間就是全長十三公里的航道，日本人的計劃中，靠近船閘的半段，要挖深至大沽零點下六公尺，再向外伸展的半段，要挖至八公尺深，勝利前，這段航道已被挖深到六公尺，接收之際，計劃已被焚毀，材料也被盜賣了一部，又散失了一部，是一個　爲紊亂的局面。</p>
<p>工程局完成船閘</p>
<p>新港工程局組成後，主持者針對着漳沽的迫切需要，以全力從事於船閘的完成自十月間動工起，到十二月十三日就宣告完工了，十二月十五日新港工程局舉行船閘試航，記者應邀前往參觀，對於得能親自看着大沽口海河之新的　　，從今關始，實在感到莫大的欣慰，早晨九點鐘從天津搭乘新港工程局的招待車出發，是深冬裹艱得有的一個好天氣雖然津塘公路正在興修的路面極不平，坦使車子顚簸得厲害，但是這個無風而和暖的早晨，給人的是滿勝鬆快，沿路上看着結了冰的水田，有些人正從冰穴中撈魚，亮晶晶的冰面，向眼中閃耀着陽光，村童穿着大棉鞋在冰上愉快的溜着，從審美的角度上來看，冬天也是可愛的，在瀏覽於沿途無限冬景的時候，雖是兩小時的途程，但不覺間已到了新港。</p>
<p>新船閘人工挖成</p>
<p>到達船閘之後，試航立即開始。船閘的位置是在海河口的北側，船閘上端開於海河，下端便是全部人工挖成的十三公里長的航道，直入海中。船閘本身長一百八十公尺，闊廿一公尺，高九點七公尺，閘底高度，在大沽零點下五公尺，低水時深五公尺，高水時深達八公尺。船閘兩端的閘口，每扇質一百八十噸，裝有空氣浮箱，可藉浮力减輕重量一百四十順，因之水中質量祗有四十　，啓閉全用電力，啓開或關閉一次，各需時約兩分鐘。全部機械本來在敵偽時期是向日本定製的，勝利後則始終沒有運來，現在機械是臨時配凑的，操縱室裹裝有七十五匹馬力電動機一部，實際上有四十匹馬力即可啓閉閘門，操縱案設在船閘的北岸，因爲機械是多方凑成的，主特人任爲可能有操縱不靈的情形發生，所以他們還在訪查以前在日本定製的那套機器，準備更換。</p>
<p>試航時　窺得全貌</p>
<p>我們站在操縱室三樓平台上，參觀這次試航，問時在顧台上　約略的可以看到新港的全貌，從樓頂望去，閘門南側的南防波堤淸晰可見，堤南一片汪洋，在海河口外那裹，就潛在着衆所週知的大沽攔門沙，北防波堤因距離太遠，完全看不見，但航這北側人工整出的一大片陸地上，却可以很淸楚看見完工百分之九十以上的第一碼頭，向海河這面看，滿河漂着潔白的冰塊，彎彎曲曲像一條白蟒蜷伏在地上，金星號試航船就泊在閘門外的海河中，十一點二十分，這上端的閘門在旗語揮下被啓開，於是金星號被一只小拖船由海河拖進閘內，閘門隨之即被關閉，這時船泊閘內，等待着閘內與大沽水位的調劑，二十五分鐘後，下端的閘門啓開，金星號乃仍被小拖船牽引着，排擠開密集在四週的次境，駛出海中，試航遂告順利完成，海河同大沽的海水從此由這　　結合，而開始了新生命。</p>
<p>航道碼頭　待加工</p>
<p>試航旣畢，我們接着又被引唱參觀機器廠和男一碼頭，機器廠分鑄工，鉚工，鉗工，鍜工等部，船閘閘門便是這工廠的傑作，第一碼頭，全長七百公尺，可以同時停泊着三千噸的輪船五隻至七隻，不過深度還未臻理想，目前祗有三公尺深，三千噸船隻停靠有很多不便，參觀時有隻挖泥船正在那裏工作着，理想的深度是六公尺，至於那條長十三公里的航道，本來已挖深至大沽零點下六公尺，然而由於南防波堤並未完工，以致仍有泥沙漂入，加以航道兩坡坍塌，根據測量，一年來竟已被淤墊達一公尺半，也亟須疏濬，修建碼顯，疏濬航道，是工程局已定的三年內主要工作，這工作以使新港每年具有二百萬至四百萬噸吞吐量爲目標，爲此，在航道北側，碼頭之外，準備挖成兩處深水停泊地，甩以容留三萬噸的巨輪，此外工程人員更還有理想的遠景，然而把新港建成北方標準的巨港，那是需要歲月的，在參觀工作完成之後，我想起了日本人最初的計劃，要使新港相負二千七百萬噸的呑個量，這是一個理想，但却是一吐極富有意義的理想。</p>

<h3>中夏詩篇在歐洲　山景之佳推瑞士·水色之美惟荷蘭</h3>
<p>— 一月一日荷蘭航訊</p>
<p>王家鴻參事　書事兩章</p>
<p>聯合國科學文敎運動之獎進新藝術，並其資助詩篇西譯之偉畫豐功，文運天開，足破思想界歷世未聞之祀錄。料此後歐美好山水，見諸中夏詩人之吟詠者，亦當有美不勝收之喜。自歐洲各國言，山景之佳推瑞士，水景之美惟荷蘭，往昔之世風，不知以文敎爲重，西方名物，不容藉最優美之漢文方塊字，相與俱彰，未免可惜。今則不然，瑞士天然美，天下所盡知。</p>
<p>我國詠瑞士詩之可誦者，如駐瑞士使館王參事家鴻山巔水涯漫遊書事兩章即其例。其一云：『管他今日是何年，涉想無懷與葛天，信步沿溪忘路遠，倚欄聽笛愛雲閑，雜花經雨開還落，野老垂綸倦即眠，別有水嬉諸女伴，楚腰爭鬥柳枝妍。』其二云：『行到山重水複處，又看花柳照繽紛，水無點滓如明鏡，山有奇峰勝夏靈，渺渺予懷隨夢遠，飄飄仙樂隔溪聞，晩來較量三分月，未必揚州占二分。』</p>
<p>詩聖黃蘊之　過萊芒湖</p>
<p>迨讀北平最高學府雋才黃蘊之遊瑞士詩，妙緒天開，更是海外詩聖。其秋日過萊芒湖（Lac　Lemen）五律云：『衆不驚搖落，西風盪我心，續雲斷層黛，鉤月透疏險，天與人俱靜，討隨夢轉深，冷冷萊蔓水，波細穩浮禽』。又其瑞士郊遊雜詠云：『莽莽晴空薄霧遮，遙空積雪漾銀沙，天心未忍秋憔悴，渲染霜林樹樹花。』其二云：『奔騰高仞有懸泉，泉底嵐光倍覺妍，明月出從人去後，松濤幽韻自年年』。其三云：『繞籬綘白奪春華，農婦開顏稚子譁，始信時平多勝景，臥田瓜熟燦如霞』。其四云！一風物殊方萬象開，故園刦後有荒萊，排空雲樹參差影，恍是哀鴻逐眼來』</p>
<p>四詩憂民愛國，懷抱不凡。第二首後兩句，他樂風飄，超異凡響，難能獨絕，秀妙無倫。</p>

<h3>ＯＫ糖發明　荷蘭科學家帶來了新的甜質</h3>
<p>— 一月一日萊汀航訊　本報特約記者往仁</p>
<p>糖爲熱帶地之特產，前後兩度世界天織，嗜甜食之歐洲各地民衆，盡苦缺糖，洵近代物質文明人力所不易彌之甚大缺憾。</p>
<p>荷國蕪汀敎授（Prof.van　der　Weijden）在第二屆歐洲大戰以前，發明一種深棕色之甜質，近經留美荷科學家房達卡氏（Van　der　Kade），加以改良，求得橙黃色及紅色之兩質，其橙黃色之質，商務名稱日Ｏ.K.糖，（按美　承諾之詞O.K.兩字，原意爲Order　of　the　King君命或王令。）計具四種特長：（一）有四千倍於蔗糖之甜。（二）食之無書。（三）不至如代用糖（saccharin）之別具一種怪味，（西文作副味）。（四）化學上之構成方式頗簡單，製造尚易，且不需另備特種機器。</p>

<h3>新歲希望與疑問　美國八十屆國會開幕了！</h3>
<p>— 儲玉坤</p>
<p>這一星期，是一九四七年的歲首。回顧與前瞻，終覺得一九四七年有無限的希望。誰都知遭：戰後全世界人民日夜渴望的，就是『和平』『民主』的實現。所以我們對於一九四七年的希望，也就是希望道一九四七年成爲眞正的『和平民主年』。</p>
<p>「和平民主年」已經度過了她的第一個星期，在這七天之內，我們看到中國國民政府頒佈新憲法，美國宣佈戰爭狀態的終止，英國陸軍參謀長蒙特戈梅萊元帥的赴蘇聯訪問，倫敦巴勒斯坦會議即將復會，法國總統行將選舉等等消息，同時又聽到各國元首各界領袖所發表的元旦獻辭，對於一九四七年，都表示相當的樂觀。</p>
<p>未來疑問共十三個</p>
<p>但是在另一方面，國際的逆流，仍在洶湧澎湃，歲首的希望，也很難令人過分樂觀。美國關心國際政治的人士，曾於歲首提出十三個疑問。的確値得我們深思的：（一）美將失去和平呼？或將竄得和平乎？（二）蘇聯將爲「一個世界」而忠實努力乎？抑或聽任世界分裂爲二乎？（三）德國在第三德意志帝國的廢墟中將以何種姿態再度出現？（四）日本將爲太平洋的和平份子乎？朝鮮將爲思想鬥爭的戰塲乎？（五）中國將統一乎？抑或繼續內戰乎？（六）殖民地的衝突蔓延不已，有無解決辦法？（七）巴爾幹問題果能解決乎？蘇聯對於土耳其海峽將採取何種行動乎？（八）中東之煤油將着火焚燒乎？抑或能用於和平乎？（九）巴勒斯坦將發生何種事態乎？（十）聯合國機構處理西班牙弗朗哥問題能成功乎？抑或失敗乎？（十一）拉丁美洲名國將團結一致乎？阿根廷總統貝爾降上校將成立法西斯政體乎？（十二）各國在南極競爭果能限於科學的競爭乎？（十三）比爾特海軍上將在南極探險，是否將爲國際競爭錫礦之先聲？</p>
<p>美國國會業已開幕</p>
<p>美國第八十屆國會，已於三日開慕，在野十五年的共和黨，恢復了它對於國會的控制權，首先推舉共和黨衆議員馬丁爲衆議院議長，即席就職，並發表演說稱：『美國現行制度，已使美國成爲有史以來最偉大的國家，美國政府實無容納偏袒共產主義制度者之餘地』。馬丁議長演說時，議風的掌聲，不絕於耳。美國衆議院充滿了反共產主義，反故總統羅斯福的情緒，也可見一斑了。同時參議會也推選共和黨參議員范登堡爲臨時議長。爲了民主黨參議員比爾波賄選事，關了二三天，眞使美國第八十屆國會閙得昏天黑地。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統在這種情况之下，向第八十屆國會提出咨文，報告今後的施政万針，也唯有籲請共和黨與民主黨合作了。</p>
<h3>戰後德國近況　共產主義漸失勢</h3>
<p>— 合眾社特派員亞諾德著　安孚譯</p>
<p>在希特勒崩潰以後一年又七個月的今天，德國仍是歐洲政治上的一個謎。</p>
<p>但是過去三個月中柏林和四國佔領區內的選舉已把混亂的政治塲面打掃一淸，足使留心研究戰後德國政治的人們獲得兩個廣泛的結論如下：</p>
<p>一·蘇聯佔領軍所支持的共產主義已逐漸失勢。</p>
<p>二•如果整個德國明日將舉行自由民主的選舉，那末，基督敎民主黨（在德國南部稱爲基督敎社會主義同盟）大槪可望得到最後勝利。</p>
<p>這些觀察家相信：在一個直接的民衆選舉中，戰後德國第一個政府的首任總統將是頎長而瘦弱的雅各。凱塞（Jacob　Kaiser），他是基督敎民主回盟約所謂「左派」的頓袖，現年五十八歲，其總部將設在柏林。</p>
<p>許多盟國的觀察家現在承認－不少德國人也將同意－基督敎民主黨人所以能孚衆望，一部份是因為他們直到現在尚未成爲佔領列強中任何一國的「試騐的氣球」。</p>
<p>今日欲想把德國視作一種政治的單位，這種企圖無異想把蘇聯，法國，美國和英國的內部政治聯繫起來。</p>
<p>西部三個佔領區，連問四大政黨（基督敎民主黨，社曾民主黨，共產黨和自由民主黨），實際上仍和蘇軍所控制的德國東部彼此隔絕，德國東部祗有三個政黨（共產黨控制的社會統一黨，基督敎民主黨和自由民主然）獲得認可。</p>
<p>整個的政治機構可以說是「人爲的，」因爲這些政黨本身都是在盟國認可之下誕生而僅憑盟國的加護而准許生長的</p>
<p>德國兩政治舞台今日旋轉在四大政黨的四周。這四個政黨就是在蘇軍佔領區和柏林的共產黨（即社會統一黨），本年春季由共產當和左翼社會黨合併而成；社會民主黨，基督敎民主黨和自由民主黨。</p>
<p>此外還有較小的「反對黨」和「磨斧黨」，但它們的得　權很有限，所以它們在全部政治景象中的重要性也很微小。</p>
<p>今日的共產學（或社會統一黨），迴溯到希特勒以前的時代，是代表舊時的德國共產黨，附帶着強烈的蘇　埃共產主義。德國的共產黨，像蘇聯的共產黨一樣，是代表極權的黨的控制和階級的意識。</p>
<p>他們的黨義着重於解放被壓迫的人，鞏固勞工階級的團結，並利用一個强大的中央政府使德國統一。</p>
<p>他們的領袖人才都是從莫斯科訓練的德國共產黨人中選出來的，像在希特勒淸黨時期內險遭不測死裹逃生的威爾希姆•比克（Wilhelm　Pieck）和隨同蘇軍重進德國的華爾德•烏爾布立契（Walter　Ulbricht）。</p>
<p>最近退居後位約有左翼社會黨領袖奧吐·格羅托華爾（Ottl　Grotoworl）和他的代理人馬克斯•福熙納（Max　FOchner），後者允許和共產黨共同組織社會統一黨或「混合」黨。</p>
<p>社會民主黨也曾遭遇希特勒的淸黨運動，其領袖人才雖弱，但已從猛烈的反共計劃中在柏林奠定了偉大的基礎。</p>
<p>在西部佔領區內，他們偉大的德國領袖是柯特·許馬却（Kurt　Schumacher）博士，道個祗有一隻手臂的政治家竭力主張把馬克思社會主義配合在近代經濟圖畫中，並强調英國式的「民族主義。」</p>
<h3>華府奇事多　白宮的薪俸單上杜魯門榜上無名總統向婦人領錢令人越想越糊塗</h3>
<p>— 葉韻蘭譯自星期六晚郵報</p>
<p>華盛頓奇特的事情很多；其中有一樁是美國總統的名字從來沒有在白宮的薪俸單上見過。事實上定無論那一張薪俸單上總統均未曾榜上有名。一月一回，用公事字眼來說，他必須「咨」請政府讓他在國會核准的七萬五千美元年俸裏面支取十二分之一。不過一個子兒也不缺，社魯門總統總是在每月一號很爽快地就拿到了錢。</p>
<p>白宮，財政部，以及會計總署等衛門裹年高德劬的文官們遇到別人詢問這個令人越想越糊塗的事實，並請求加以解釋的時候，總是一無辦法地搖擺着他們灰白色的腦袋。</p>
<p>像任何其他一個領薪俸過活的美國人一樣，杜魯門先生也要向國家繳付應納的所得稅。因此一千一百四十七元六角須由他的薪水中扣除，剩下的則還有五千一百零二元四角。不過他應納的全部稅額還不止此，據估計總統每年呈繳聯邦政府的稅款總共達四萬六千美元，另外還須加付呈繳米蘇里州的稅款一千美元，其本人凈得祗有二萬八千美元而已。除開正薪之外，做總統的人每年僅可支旅費二萬五千元以資貼補。</p>
<p>批准證明書是總統領取薪俸繁複手續的開端。照官樣的公文旅行程序來說，此項證明書須移轉到財政部會計司賬務稽核科科長伍德森手裏，經過嚴密的審核以後方行認可。此後經過稽核認可的付款書與批准證明書又須同時移往美國財政部長辦公室。</p>
<p>這時，這件公文便落到派拉斯夫人手裏了。她是一個中年婦人，官銜是「美國財政部長特別帮辦」。一張抬頭是哈萊，社魯門的五千一百零二元四角支票上須由她簽上B.R.Pallas三字纔能領款。</p>
<p>支票經過杜魯門總統背書並由銀行支付以後，乃復返到開頭所說的會計總署裏歸檔，該署的檔案實在是一個傳奇式的親筆簽名大成，如把它們賣出去準可以値好幾百萬美金。這些文件顯示着華盛頓從來沒有領過薪水，每次總是零碎支付自二百元以至一千三百美元不等的款項，前後總額僅二萬五千美元而已。目前總統按月支薪的繁複手續大約始自極斐遜連任的時候，他每月薪額爲二千零八十三元三角三分，工作滿一年後還得另外附上四分錢方得領取二萬五千元的整數。</p>
<p>以今日生活費用的高漲而論，同爲總統，華盛頓和極斐遜所得的薪給比杜魯門實際上不知要高出多少。</p>
<h3>美總統向她拿錢</h3>
<h3>納粹科學家　在美繼續研究工作</h3>
<p>— 徐尚均譯自生活週刋</p>
<p>遠在歐洲大陸上的戰事還沒有結束以前，希特勒最寳貴的科學工作者隊伍中就有些人悄悄地在德國的土地上消失。這些使得他們的祖國在定向擲射武器，超音速學，氣體動力學，以及彈道學上勝過盟國的科學家們，立刻就被送往曾經和他們敵對過的國家境內。盟國在獲取這些戰利「人」的工作中，有時必須合作，有時則成爲一種獵取頭腦的比賽。在這項比賽中，美國顯然是勝利者。上月內（去年十二月）陸軍部宣稱，有很多這樣得來的科學家正經常在美國從事於研究設計的工作。</p>
<p>美國在第一綫的挺進軍中特別派有專門搜尋並招降德國科學家和工業家中主要人物的軍官。他們做着這項工作並不感到困難。科學家雖然世界各國都在儘量尋求，他們之中大多數的人却都願意接受甚至渴望着美國的邀請。非常迅速秘密地，德國最傑出的頭腦以及無價的研究成果就這樣渡過了大西洋。這時美國陸軍人員已經在俄亥俄州賴特飛機塲和塔克薩斯州的勃利斯要塞等候着接待他們了；以後有些人乃被護送到新墨西哥州白莎城的美國火箭砲試驗站。這些科學家們在那裹便立刻雄立起工作塲來從事研究某種陸軍未能解決的問題。對於美國專家們所作數不淸楚的詢問，這些德國人直到現在爲止，都充分地顯示着合作的精神，一點也不加以隱瞞。</p>
<p>這些納粹科學家們所得到的名義是「美國陸軍部歐洲戰區在美國境內暫時服役之非軍職僱員。」事實上他們僅和美國訂有軍部有權隨時更改的短期合同。他們住在陸軍營房裏，吃着陸軍伙食，每天可拿六元美金的生活津貼，另外還有不很多的薪水，由他們留在歐洲的家屬領取。他們並不算是戰俘，在工作時間以外可以自由離開營房。在優秀的科學家們，將來還有拿全薪，甚至獲得美國公民資格的希望。到那時候他們的全家便可接來美國團聚了。這些科學家中想回返德國的人極少。</p>
<p>有些粹科學家幾乎稍微再遲一步就不能逃出德國。德莎城容克飛機製造廠研究主任佛朗茲曾經和他的助手們詳細計議，結果確定到西方去大吉大利。恰當俄國兵到達以前不久，方纔隨着美國人一同撤退。Ｖ－２武器研究計劃中心潘乃苗德城勃勞恩博士和他的主要助手携帶了一切他們所能得到的文件，愴惶奔向美國陣地而來。很多科學家都欣然遵從希特勒的召喚走向巴伐里亞內堡，因爲他們知道在那裏將和美國人相遇。雖然別的國家對於德國科學的精華同樣追求甚烈，間或也能獲得成功，美國想要得到的東西已經差不多全部得到。這事的原因是：德國　科學家們對於美國所懷的愛　最大，而對於她所懷的恐慌　嚴小。</p>
<h3>聯合國會址　曼哈頓　商人不願遷讓</h3>
<p>聚集在曼哈頓東邊一帶的小商人不願搬塲，甚至爲了聯合國要在這裹設立會址，他們也不肯遷讓。</p>
<p>「我在這裏已有十六年了。」愛娜•桂斯妮絲基把她的身子斜倚在她的小雜貨店的櫃檯上說。「我的生活很不錯，而現在他們竟然要呌我搬塲了。」</p>
<p>「好吧，我將對他們說：你們給我代價，給我好的代價。那位洛克斐勒是很有錢的。如果他們給我以相當的代價，那末我也許肯搬塲」。</p>
<p>這是一個六幢房屋所在的地區，洛克斐勒打算以八百五十萬美元的代價購下這個地區，然後捐贈與聯合國。這地方在東河的兩岸，介於第四十二道街和第四十八道街的中間，差不多完全是個工商業區。</p>
<p>「我們雖不住在這裏，但我們很喜歡這裹的地方，」一個灰白色頭髮的顏料公司經理麥克卡蒂說。「我們畢竟是在這裏謀生的，而且在這裏已有二十個年頭了。」</p>
<p>麥克卡蒂說，他不知道那裘去找另外一個地方。</p>
<p>他說：「如果他們打算替退伍軍人建造一些房屋，那末我倒也無所謂。但是我不明白我們爲什麼爲了聯合國而要搬塲。」</p>
<p>在街道的那一邊，哈萊，買順望着他的二十三歲的兒子李昂納特在一准汽車胎中工作。</p>
<p>「他剛從軍隊中退伍出來，」賈順說。「我在這座屋子裹已有十四年了。我把李昂納時敎養成人，做我的經理。現在，怎麼？如果聯合國要佔據這個地方，我們不得不遷地爲良。搬到什麼地方去呢？我不知道。我眞不知道怎麼辦。」</p>
<h3>地球的年齡　二十九億九千萬年</h3>
<p>— 安孚譯自讀者文摘</p>
<p>我們生活所在的地球究有多少年齡？　殺後我們到底有了答案。著名的蘇格蘭地質學家亞塞·福爾摩斯博士已宣布了我們這個行星所過的歲數。福爾摩斯博士根據原子物理學的精密的事實，已實現了一個懷抱已久的「測量地質學上時間的深度」的希望。他這種傑出的研究，是很動人的；因爲研究的結果顯示：我們這個世界的年齡大約是兩借於任何人以前所相信的。　福爾摩斯傳士所追溯的並不是地球的起源－關於這一點，科學至今仍不能確定－而僅是原始嚴石形成的時間。他說明我們這個行星的年齡已達二十九億儿千萬年之多。</p>
<p>研究據點</p>
<p>但是他的研究的據點是什麼呢，這個據點是「純科學」的，沒有顯明的實際價値。可是嘲笑的人應記得：當留溫霍克用第一具顯微鏡顯示一滴飲水中藏有數千微生物的時候，他也受人議笑。差不多有二百年之久，一班講求實際的人不明白研究這種極小的世界（微生物）究竟有什麼意思－直到後來巴斯德證明：細菌所奪去的生命更多於歷史上一切戰爭所毁滅的生命。這個敎訓請我們對於福爾摩斯博士的這種驚人的數字加以重視，因爲這位愛丁堡的敎授作成了一種在科學技能上出神入化的功績。</p>
<p>遠在一六五〇年，烏歇主敎從聖經的論據上得到一個結論：地球的年齡是五千六百五十四歲。在他以後不久，早期的地質學家把世界的年齡大大的延長。在我們的這一世紀初，偉大的物理學凱　文　想　煞地質學上的證據，他堅持地球的年齡最多不會超過二千七百萬年。但不久以後，鐘的發見推翻了以前每一個計算。</p>
<p>但是讓我們先來看一看人類在什麼時候出現在地球上。古物學上的種種事實斷然證明：新石器時代的人類的在一萬年之前抵達西歐。再查考埋在地下的人骨和器具，我們發覺人類出現在三萬年之前。而人科，包括我們人類和現已滅絕的其他形似人類的生物，則大的在三十三萬三千年之前從非人類的祖先中蛻變出來。</p>
<p>當然，地質學家知道其他動物，植物和巖石已有更久長時間的存在。試把海洋來考慮一下。海水中十萬部份的水，祗有十二部份是白堊。然而四千八百萬方英里的海洋底層厚厚的舖滿着白堊質的輭泥，而這種輭泥就是海洋中極微小的生物的屍體所造成的。這些動物需贊幾萬萬年的時間纔能把牠們的駭骨舖滿這樣廣大的海底賽地。</p>
<p>從化石和煤層，火山和峽谷中，科學已在一九〇〇年撰成一大堆的書籍，確切證明地球至少已有二億歲的年齡。</p>
<p>地質革命</p>
<p>馬利和保·羅居禮完成了地質學上的革命。他們二人對於鐳的發見，顯示地球年齡較之凱爾文所想像的老得不知多少，因爲像鐳一類有放射能的元素一直在供給熱力予我們這個行星，其方法以前從未有人猜到過。但更重要的是：鐳和鈾供給地質學家以一種非常準確的「鐘」，足以測量過去的時間。</p>
<p>我們必須要明白這些原子時計是怎樣工作的。第一，準確的實騐室的試騐顯示一盎斯的鐳僅在一千五百八十年後將消失一半。一盎斯的鈾須過了四十五億年纔消失一半。其餘半盎斯再過四十五億年又消失一半，而衹剩四分之一盎斯，這樣依次類推的消失下去。　物理學能在極小的分量中看出鈾的原子，並能測量它們中間和最後潰壞的產物。所以，當我們在巖石中找到這些物質的時候，我們就能準確地說出這巖石已存在多久了。因此，居禮的研究使雷賴敎授能在一九二一年說：地球上的生物大概在十億年以前已存在了。</p>
<p>但是我們的知識中，仍有一個嚴重的缺陷。那就是在我們現在所知道的巖石中開始放射能的變化以前，是怎樣的情形呢？這個似乎是一個無法解決的謎。</p>
<p>一九三八年聶爾博士在美國化學會雜誌上發表了一篇關於鉛鑛石的數字，這些數字是由全世界各處鉛鑛寄給他的。愛丁堡科學家亞塞•福爾摩斯在這些統計裹而看到有一個機會，可以解決那最古老的謎。</p>
<p>偵探故事</p>
<p>但他費了二年的時間，　找到他所需要的助手。那是一具計算機。如果沒有這其計算機，那末這位老敎授也許要費去一百萬年的時間纔能解決各種方程式！甚至有了這具機器的帮助，發掘每一個綫索的工作也是很吃力的。</p>
<p>幸虧我們不妨把這裹所牽涉的算學暫置一旁而仍追踪這個驚人的偵探故事。這裏是一件「無頭案子」，足以考騐你在許多綫索中的思想能力。</p>
<p>基本的事實是很重要的。開始時這裏有四個化學上證人：四種不同的金屬鉛。那是「正常」鉛（二四）及其三種同位原質（二〇六，二〇七，二〇八）。這三種同位原質是在放射能的原素潰敗的時候產生出來的。二〇八鉛是由鋵原子的分解形成的，同時二〇六和二〇七則來自鈾。所以這幾種鉛都是世界開始以後在我們地球的巖石裘面形成的。</p>
<p>但是二〇四鉛並不是從其他任何原素中形成的。所以福爾摩斯博士稱它做「原始鉛」。它在地球變成固體的時候，一　地質學上的事實告訴我們同位原質是怎樣形成的。無數世代前，當原始鉛漸漸集合而形成鉛鑛石的時候，它經過龐大的地壳的巖石，這種巖石裹面含有足夠的鈾和鋵，足以產生同位原質的鉛。</p>
<p>福爾摩斯博士費了四年的光陰，終於解決了一種代數的方程式。他所得到的答案是從原始巖石形成以來到現在爲止，中間所過的時間是大約二十九億九千萬年。</p>

<h3>金島</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>本報昨天的香港通信，報道了香港最近恢復繁榮的悄况，比如半島酒店門前的汽車又排列成行了，港九渡輪甚至附搭汽車的油蔴地班都來往如梭了，匯豐銀行們前兩大銅獅子也從日本運回米，安坐原來的石基上了；最令人喫驚的，是本月十四日開獎的馬票，在一星期前已賣出三十萬條以上，富翁紛紛而來，遊資集中，使香港肥胖，使香港繁榮了。</p>
<p>勝利前在香港住過一些時候的人，當能深切明瞭香港政府經營這座小島的政策和用心，勝利後的今日，想不致有所改變，然而那個時候，我們的國家在抗戰，我們是迫不獲已，以香港作爲一個聯絡站；今日情勢逈異，我們沒有逃避香港的必要，特別是人在上海錢去香港，誠不知是何心肝？，　　金之島呀；却發生了深圳血案，却發生了踢斃小販事件，而這兩件案子的結果如何呢？這不將給予我一種啓示嗎？</p>
<h3>驅霧新利器　ＦＩＤＯ</h3>
<p>— 孫祖培節譯英文大美晩報</p>
<p>霧已成爲世界民用航空的一大威脅，最近接連發生的飛行慘案的主要原因也由於霧。下面是聯合社記者的報導，我們可以知道美國是怎樣的在和霧作戰。</p>
<p>在加利福尼亞州阿凱泰飛機塲，最近有過一次表演，顯示戰後驅霧的進步在表演中，我們第一次看到驅霧新利器『飛圖』（FIDO）的應用，——二分鐘內把濃霧燒成一個七百呎長，三百呎寬，六百呎高的洞。一隻載了新聞人員和觀察者的飛機，作了八次成功的接近跑道　　行，雖然淸晰地面之外的視界祗有五百呎左右。</p>
<p>『飛圖』（FIDO），饅初在一·四二年用於英國的英美轟飛機，當時他們時需在濃霧中出　德國，不能不有這種設備，那時他們大量的飛機汽油沿着跑道燃燒，以達成驅霧的目的。</p>
<p>大放濃霧</p>
<p>新的『飛圖』用柴油作燃燒物，柴油較汽油便宜，且具有同量汽油二倍的熱能；也就是說，柴油的效率爲汽油的兩倍，但柴油需要高壓力和化汽器。在一千七百五十磅壓力之下，汽化了的柴油，從幾百隻噴射器中，吐出了熾烈無烟的火燄，使四周耀亮得如森林大火一樣。在這種强力炙熱中，霧的蒸發很快的完成，而跑道的輪廓，在熊熊火燄及他種燈光協助之下，顯得異常淸晰。</p>
<p>不過『飛圖』也需普通無綫電的帮助，無綫電使飛機的飛行方向與跑道的方向一致，並使其保持一個適當的下傾角度，飛機就能接近跑這。最近在實騐中，尚有使火燄燒成一條兩端大小的『光槽』，小的一端位在跑道的起點，大的則在跑道起點之外的二英里之遙。這樣，司機祇須把飛機駛下這條『光槽』，就能進入『飛圖』燒成的霧孔，而淸晰地看到機塲的一切。</p>
<p>美國研究</p>
<p>爲了建立關於驅霧的知識，以及他種輔助降陸的設備，使各種軍用及民用機，都能不顧氣候，按着時間表飛行，差不多美國全國與航空有關的機構，都參與驅霧的研究工作。海軍，陸軍，民用航空部，民用航空管理局，空運協會，和機師協會，皆已與阿凱泰機塲訂了合同，從事研究。</p>
<p>至於爲什麼研究地點要揀在遼遠的加利福尼亞的北部？那是爲了那裹多霧而近油源的緣故，油的供給在應用『飛圖』上，是一個主要的問題；當全機塲所有的舉霧火燄燒至最猛烈的時候，每小時需要三車最的汽油和柴油，即使新的高壓『飛圖』每小時亦需二車量的柴油，或二萬五千加侖，每分鐘的價格的在二十五元美金以上。</p>
<p>在戰爭初期的英國，一架轟炸機着陸，就需用五千美元的汽油。經過數次改良，現在已降至五十美元。這對於為霧所困的載客機，每分鏡一元美金，尚不失爲一合理的價格。但對於小的飛機，所費則似太大。</p>
<p>上海橫斷面</p>
<h3>人間何世？</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>截足斷腿為了吃飯</p>
<p>時至今日，社會上各階級的人，大都感覺到施捨的麻煩。而且乞丐繁多，事實上是施捨不盡的，於是人心漸漸變硬，逢到乞丐上門，或是路逢呌化，都是置之不顧。十人中也難逢到一個願意給錢的。這種現象已成爲很顯著的事實，丐流生活的艱難困苦，自是可想而知了。</p>
<p>但是殘廢的丐流，他們的收入却例外，一般人對於截手斷足瞎眼的乞丐，都較易打動了同情心，尤其是一般樂善好施的奶奶太太們，最能體貼苦難的丐流。殘廢階級的乞丐，無形中成了呌化國中的貴族，引起一般丐流的仰望與羨慕。</p>
<p>乞丐之所以殘廢，成因是先天性的遺傳，或是母體操勞過度，或因分娩時的不愼，還有的是在嬰孩時缺乏照料，童年時受了打跌等傷書，自然而成爲殘廢的‘這種在常人所認爲不幸遭遇的，但在貧苦不堪的丐國裹的人看來，却反視為至寳。因爲可以藉此實行其「喊街」的生涯，在他的一生中，可以呌化到更多的金錢，比較一般非殘廢的丐伴得到多出十數倍的收入，引動一般丐流的眼紅。</p>
<p>受了以上事實的影響，遂使丐流的父母都希望他們的子女個個生來魷成爲殘廢，但是往往天不從人願；在這無可奈何之中，他們甚至竟忍心害理的，把他們的子女弄成殘廢。在童年時候，硬着心陽，把他們的肢體截去一部份，或將雙眼弄瞎。最忍心而滅絕人道的，是在嬰孩時代，便用各種器具，限制其肢體的一部或數部，使他不能和全身同時發育。到年長時便成爲廢人了。於是讓他們加入在丐帮裏喊街去，好替家裏去多掙錢呢。</p>
<p>在許多農村裹，因爲生產全部停頓，人智閉塞，窮苦萬狀，於是風俗漸漸地流於野蠻。在那裏生長的人，絕對沒有就職業的門路，自然也沒有魷職業的技能與思想。而且也無受敎育的機會。唯一的出路，便是過着「點槍碉子」的乞丐生活。</p>
<p>這種人造殘廢的惡俗，在赤貧的荒村區域裏是不斷地流行着的。尤其是在長江北岸，簡直是司空見慣不足爲奇的。讀者如果細心觀察，必定可以在本埠及所到過的許多城鎭裹找出許多的殘廢乞丐。試問他們又不是血戰餘生的傷兵，何來道許多斷手截足的可憐人呢？筆者屢次在厦門，福州，上海，南京等地，看到同探的手足四肢全被截斷的乞丐，在閙市的泥道中滾動，實行他的點槍丐帮「翻太歲」的喊街生活。人間何世，竟有如是悲慘事？</p>
<h3>時事問答：一九四七年　十大問題答案</h3>
<p>— 家南答</p>
<p>値茲歲序更新，人們莫不滿腔熱望着新年勝過舊歲。可是據法國新聞社的電訊，華盛頓人士認為在今年政治的地平綫上，却有十三個重大問題尚待分曉。現在且把其中比較有興趣的十個，轉錄如下，並用猜測的方式，擬就了它們的答案：對否，尚待事實證明。</p>
<p>（一）美國將　得和平？還是會失去和平？</p>
<p>答：天下事無論大小，如欲達到目的，必須軟硬兼施，剛柔並用。當今惟一足以阻撥美國爭取和平努力的，似衹有蘇聯一國。假如美國眞能定下一個大公無私的政治綱領，毫無自私的成份參雜其間，同時又能以充份的實力，作為後盾，美國必能嬴得和平。</p>
<p>（二）蘇聯將爲「天下一家」而努力嗎？還是聽任世界分裂？</p>
<p>答：蘇聯對於「天下一家」的觀念，自有其特殊的解釋。從蘇聯的立塲講，她眞可以說無時不在爲「天下一家」而努力，可是從其他國家的立塲講，這或許眞是分裂世界的企圖。相對論的說法，在這裹似也可以適用。</p>
<p>（三）在「第三德意志共和國」的廢墟中，德國將以何種姿態再度出現？</p>
<p>答：德國政治前途，有三種可能性：（甲）四國佔領區統一，成立中央政府；（乙）繼續目前四分五裂的狀態；（丙）成立聯邦政府，中央的權力小，地方的權力大。從德國國內和國際的情勢看，以第三種可能性最易成爲事實。</p>
<p>（四）日本在太平洋方而將否成爲和平份子？朝鮮將否成爲思想鬥爭的戰塲？</p>
<p>答：以受過日本侵略痛苦最深的中國人說，對於日本是否能成爲太平洋方面的和平份子一點，不得不出以極大的保留，並且應該隨時警惕。至於朝鮮，是美蘇兩國除德國外陸上唯一有直接接觸的地方，武力鬥爭固然還不至於，思想的鬥爭却是免不了的</p>
<p>殖民地衝突蔓延不止，有</p>
<p>辦法？</p>
<p>答：殖民地是帝國主義時代的遺物，在目前以思想進步相標榜的世界上竟還不斷聞着殖民衝突，不能不說是人類的一大恥辱。今後的發展，胥視殖民國家的自私觀念和殖民地人民的獨立願望間力量的對比而定。在一九四七年，殖民地的衝突，恐怕還要蔓延，而非一年半敝間所能解決。「眞理最後德是勝利的，但願此言不虛。</p>
<p>（六）巴爾幹問題能否獲得解決？蘇聯對於海峽問題，將採取何種行動？</p>
<p>答：蘇聯對於羅，保，匈，南，阿諸國決不放鬆，英美對希土諸國也決不放鬆，要改變旣成事實，恐怕難乎其難，僵持的狀態，大槪要維持相當時間。這可以說是已獲解決，也可以說是沒有解決。至於海峽問題，蘇聯爲了要打開海上的窗口，那裏肯退讓一步，而英美爲了保持地中海區的權益，又那會肯讓蘇聯跨上愛琴海的門檻？在這種情形之下，祗會不斷地口角，不斷地相持；最後結果，要看世界大勢而定。假如蘇聯和外界勢力相比起來，對於自己不利，她會回轉頭去注意國內的發展，不然她又要乘機而動，乘虛而出了。</p>
<p>（七）中東石油是否將着火燃燒嗎？</p>
<p>答：中東問題和巴爾幹問題，由於地理上的關係，是息息相關的。海峽的閘門衝不開，中東的石油也還不致於燎原。</p>
<p>（八）巴勒斯坦將發生何事？</p>
<p>答：巴勒斯想衝突的原因，是爲了猶太人和阿拉伯人各不相讓。猶太人要成立猶太國，阿拉伯人則主張由回族管理，不贊成劃分。耶回兩敎的聖地竟閙成如此樣子，可嘆孰甚！事實上，猶阿問題還屬表面，癥結所在，還是英美蘇利害的矛盾。目前英國支特阿拉伯族，美國比較同情猶太人，而蘇聯則高踞北方，用冷眼注意事態發展。英美對巴勒斯坦問題意見之未能一致，更使局勢複雜了。</p>
<p>（九）聯合國機構處理弗朗哥問題，將成功呢，抑將失敗？</p>
<p>答：靠法西斯勢力扶植起來的弗朗哥政權，所以還能維持到今天，完全是爲了聯合國間依然有着顯著的矛盾。老實說，世界上沒有一個國家贊成弗朗哥政權的，問題並不在弗朗哥應否打倒，而在打倒弗朗哥之後，弗朗哥政權將落入西班牙親英美政黨之手，還是落入親蘇政黨之手？聯合國機構的決議不足決定一切。</p>
<p>（十）南極的敵對狀態，是不是僅以科學競爭爲限？</p>
<p>答：南極是一塊處女地，目前還像數百年前的美洲新大陸一樣，任何國家都可以去得，但是將來總會封閉起來，尤其是對於本身安全有關諸國如澳洲，紐西蘭，阿根廷等，必然會予以極大的重視。最近，美國柏爾德海軍上將率領的探險隊已經出發，蘇聯也不甘後人，捕鯨隊亦已駛赴南極。但是以蘇聯和英美的海空實力和地理遠近相較，蘇聯是佔劣勢的。</p>

<h3>我們要求進修</h3>
<p>— 丁立風</p>
<p>職業青年之聲</p>
<p>敎育部部長先生：當條火還不曾燼息，敎育事業正忙着復員交通，校舍，經費等等問題的時候，我們來向你提出以下的這個要求，似乎不合時宜，但是，我們已經鬱積了許久，忍受了不少時間的苦痛，已經到了不得不讓這幾句話說出來的時候。</p>
<p>我們要求有一個業餘求學進修的機會，我們要求各級的學校：小學，中學，大學，研究院在業餘時間有正式的班級正式的課程來敎授給我們這些工作時間以後從機關，商店，工廠，……各處走隴來有志向學的少年，靑年，老年人！</p>
<p>現在的業餘補習，不能滿足我們的慾望；我們要研究三角，幾何，微分，沒有；地理，歷史，哲學，法律，敎育，生物，化工，電機，……也沒有！而且，業餘補習沒有升學的資格，沒有就業的資格，沒有受銓敍的資格，這一切給我們心理上的打擊也是够慘痛的！</p>
<p>我們的要求非常簡單，做起來也並不困難，祗要敎育部不限制學校的授課時間，命令各級學校把各種課程分一二班在業餘時間以後敎授，在時間上給予有職業者以便利，這魷已經是部長給我們的大恩，給國家民族的一種大德。　這種二部制敎學實行以後，社會上逸樂的風氣必將爲之一變；現在是沒有地方去上學，將來是不上學的人會受到人家議笑，一般的文化水準必將漸漸提高，受惠的豈止區區萬人！</p>
<p>也許有人担憂這樣會使社曾上的大學畢業生多如牛毛，那末，我們可以告訴他，中國的所以落後正因爲敎育的不够普及，一　些有用的天才被埋沒了的緣故。我們不必担憂大學生淪爲工役，應該担憂工役沒有大學生願意做；不然，各部門的工作不將更圓滑，工作的效率不將更增加嗎？</p>
<p>願你接受我們將近於憤怒的哀求，用道封信去告訴一切反對你這樣做的人，我們這一萬個少年，靑年，老年，將是你永遠的後盾！</p>

<h3>最近法國文藝動態</h3>
<p>— 克羅特·霍煦演講·徐仲年譯述</p>
<p>在三十五年十二月二十二日，星期日，下午勝利後，第九次「文藝茶話會」裏，來華不滿兩個月的法國人克羅特，霍煦先生（ClaudeRoche）演講：「最近法國文藝動態」，由筆者口譯。霍煦先生是巴黎人，巴黎大學的文學碩士。他來華主持上海的法文協會（AllianceFrancaise）和法國中學（College　Francais）。他對於中國文化極端崇拜，對於中國人民極表同情。這篇演講並無底稿，現今我全憑記憶追述如啟：</p>
<p>諸位先生：</p>
<p>鄙人很崇拜中國文化，可惜還不會講中國話，所以我無從知這主席徐仲年敎授介紹詞的內容。然而，一則由於剛纔徐敎授提起的幾位法國大文豪；二則因爲我和徐敎授雖是初交，可是我心儀徐敎授已久，他用法文寫的介紹中國文學的著作都很有價値：我敢於斷定徐敎授以及諸位對於法國文化必寄以莫大的同情。關於這一點，鄙人感覺非常榮幸和興奮！</p>
<p>每個民族必有他獨特的天才，遠個天才和別個民族的天才絕然不同。譬如說，法國人的天才決不像盎格魯－薩克遜的天才，也不像日耳曼的天才。什麼　是法國人的天才呢？乃是：積極，現實，才智，精細，愛美。如果我們要每一項舉幾位代表作家，那麼：實證方面有：笛卡德，孔德，左拉；才智方面有：拉•勃呂埃爾（La　Bruyere），繆賽（AIf.　de　Musset），古爾脫林納；（G.Courteline）精緻方面有：哈辛納（J.Racine），馬里芙（Marivaux）；愛美方面有：郭爾耐依（Corneille），蒲徐埃（Bossuet），馬拉爾美（Mallarme）</p>
<p>有了這樣的天才，必然還要一兩個思想中心，這便是哲學。當代法國哲學分成兩大派，乃是：（一）生存主義（existentialisme）；（二）科學哲學（philosophie　dessciences）。宇宙的構成由於「我」和「非我」。「我」爲何而生？「我」和「非我」的關係如何？「我」在「非我」間的地位又如何？沙爾脫爾（Sartre），這位生存主義的大師，告訴我們：我們的「生」是「不合理的」（absurde）：誰先經過考慮，經過選擇，而後誕生？我們的「生存」也是「不合理的」：請問，誰認爲我們的生活方式是合理的？另一位生存主義的大師•茄勃里埃兒。馬爾賽兒（Gabriel　Marcel）却願在「不合理」中找出一個「理由」來：這便是他的「希望」總之，生存主義是悲觀的主義，生存主義的文學是發揮「失望」的文學。這個主義的自身又分爲兩派：（甲）閉鎖的生存主義（exisientialisme　ferme），以沙爾脫爾爲代表；（乙）開放的生存主義（exisetntialisme　ouvert），以馬爾賽兒爲代表。至於悲觀的「濃度」，自然閉鎖的生存主義重於開放的生存主義。</p>
<p>所謂科學哲學也者，導源於原子的研究。法國研究原子的權威是波形力學（mecanique　ondulatoire）專家勃洛葛里親王（prince　Louis-Victor　de　Broglie）。在不久以前，我們總以爲原子是不能分裂的。現今我們知道每顆原子包含兩個成份，而有「空隙」介乎這兩個成份之間：所以是斷斷續續的。另一方面，原子產生「波動」，而這個「波動」却是網續不斷的。那麼，在原子本身已經包含了「矛盾」。世上的「物質」旣然由原子構成，那無異乎所有的「物質」都有「矛盾」。這種哲學推翻了以前的決定論。當今科學暫學的權威是：勃洛葛里，郞儒範（Largevin），巴煦拉爾（Bachelard）。</p>
<p>接着我們談談小說。目前的法國小說可以分成三大派：（二）抗戰小說；（二）傳統的分析小說；（三）生存主義派的小說。抗戰小說的範圍很廣；它不但描寫前綫，而且描寫後方；它不但叙連明槍交戰，而且叙述地下工作。這派小說的大師當然是斐爾谷爾（Vercor）；　的代表作是「海　　　」（Le　Silenge　de　la　mer，譯者按：該書已在重慶譯過兩次，最近上海李靑崖先生將作第三度繙譯）和「星夜行」（La　Marcheapetoile，譯者按：該書已由仲年譯出，陸續在「世界半月刊」上發表）。法國的小說向棄善於心理分析，以深刻見長。分析的對象是法國的中等社會，也可以說這是法國的幹部；分析的目標兼顧長處與短處。這個傳統始終沒有斷絕。目前分析派小說家的首領是「向麻瘋病者接吻」（Baiser　au　leppeux），一愛悄的沙漠」（Desertde　lamour）等小說的作者法郞所瓦•莫里雅克（Fraocois　Mauriac）。生存主義派的小說家以賈繆（Camus）和馬兒胡（Malraux）爲代表。賈繆所著的小說又分作兩類：幻想的和生存主義的。他的生存主義派的小說專門描寫「矛盾」，描寫「不合理」。至於馬兒胡，他到過中國，他的小說「征服者」（Conquerants）就是描寫一九三〇年左右中國人民的奮鬥，他想在行動中找尋生存的意義，却直到現在……未曾發現！剛在我們談到抗戰小說，除了　爾谷爾之外，我還得提起文壇宿將兆如•居阿美兒（Georges　Duhamel）：詩人，小說家，又兼軍醫，他目覩戰爭的殘酷，所以他是一位人道主義者。他的「文明」（Civilisaton）是一部傑作（譯者按：該書已由仲年繙譯，將付「智慧」按期發表。）</p>
<p>劇本方面，也可分爲三派：（一）抒情派，以琪烏杜（J.Giraudoux）爲代表；（二）抗戰劇，以阿諾依（Anouilh）爲代表；（三）生存主義派，以沙拉克羅（Salacrau）爲代表。最偉大的劇作家當然推殉國的琪烏杜。他的劇本往往取材於希臘文學和其它外國文學中的民間傳說；在他的劇木裹，他描寫「現實」和「夢想」交戰，而美麗的「夢想」常常勝利了。</p>
<p>當代最偉大的詩人有四位：克羅苔兒（Paul　Claudel），瓦萊里（Paul　Valery），阿哈恭（Aragon），埃呂阿爾（Eluard）。克羅苔兒到過中國，到過日本。他的詩有極濃的神秘意味。　　看來，宇宙萬物正在演奏一支偉大的交嚮曲，每個民族是樂隊中的一員。每負的喜怒哀樂無法自主，都由指揮者支配，而這位指揮者便是上帝。瓦萊里的詩律最是謹嚴，昔調最爲鏗鏘。他注重形式，歌頌理智。他的詩是「純粹的詩」（poesie　pure）。至於阿哈恭和埃呂阿爾，都是愛國詩人；他們的抗戰詩，熱情奔放，最能動人。</p>
<p>比埃爾·比維斯·杜·夏瓦納（Pierre　Puvis　ce　chavannes）死後（一八九八）所遺下來的藝術王位，一向由莫列斯•杜尼（Maurice　Denis）承繼着。他是一位壁畫能手，巴黎有若干著名的壁畫都出諸杜尼之手。和杜尼並峙的畫家則有苔瓦里埃爾（Desvallieres）；他所畫的人物更充分地表現內心的不安。其他新派的畫家如：巴加索（Picasso），馬蒂斯（Matisse），恩戴兒斯戴萊（Untersteller），勃哈克（Braque）等等，各有千秋。</p>
<p>我們以音樂來結束這個小小演講。九年以前，一九三七，莫列斯，哈斐兒（Maurice　Ravel）永遠離開了我們。對於當代法國的音樂界，這是一個無法補償的損失。他的無數而精彩的作品，如：『噴泉』（Jeux　d`eau），「華爾茲舞曲，（Valse），「卜萊和」（Bolero），「西班牙的良辰」（Heure　espagnale），「達芙尼斯與古洛埃」（Daphnis　et　Chloe），純粹是法國的作風。在常代法國的作曲家中間，無疑地，哈斐兒理常首屈一指。至於健存的音樂重鎭，乃是秉承法國和瑞士雙重傳統的海納舍爾（Haineger）。我們也不該忘掉殉國的音樂家若，爾（Jaubert），阿蘭（J.Allain），杜煦（J.C.Touche）。</p>
<p>軍事上和政治上的不幸事件並未使法國文化減色·恰巧相反，它給它以新的刺激，新的鍛鍊。不論在現在，不論在將來，我深深相信，法國的文化決不會辜負友好者的期望的。（南京，中央大學；三五，十二，復興節，追述。）</p>
<h3>塞上之秋</h3>
<p>— 僑安</p>
<p>凡在故都曾經住過的人，應該公認那邊最美妙的氣候量物不是春而是秋，春的生命太短促，繁花如雪，一夜便爲風沙吹的鹽散而埋沒了。東坡詞說：「春色三分，二分塵土，一分流水」眞不錯的。大的自開封以北，受黃河影響的地方都是如此罷！但是在悠長的秋季，水的澄潔，氣的淸肅，天的高爽，草木花葉的生意鬱勃，正與故都的人爲環境相配合，雖非少年，却是已經成熟而不至於枯竭。我們民族性格的恒久而宏大，淸高而平正，也可於北方的秋光中映發而出。春之不足，償之於秋，人生的過程中，也氷遠是這樣有味的。</p>
<p>我在民國十年廿三年兩次出游張家口，大同，綏遠，都是最近曾經兵火的地方，也都正在秋末冬初冰霜初盛之際。由北平西北行，不遠就看到矗立於原野的白楊，樹高而葉大，在剛勁嚴肅的朔風中，颯颯的動盪不休，但是樹身不搖，樹葉不落（直到深冬方落），象徵北方之强，令人肅然起敬，反而將我們平昔所縈廻於腦際的白楊蕭蕭愁殺人的觀念打破了。秋氣洽人以猛厲振奮，正好奮發有爲，何以見得一定是悲哀呢？所謂秋士之感，在日暮空庭之中，誠然不免對落葉而興懷，若在高秋塞上，根本上看不見落葉，就不必剿襲陳言，學宋玉之悲秋了。平綏鐵路的設備，在各幹綫中另具一番風格，雖頭二等也沒有華耨的衾榻，奢裕的飲饌，却是座位狠空，狠容易一人獨據一室，在平沙滿目，雪虐風餐之中，能以從容獨飲一敬熱茶，覺得別有天地，旣非現代都市生活中人所能領會，也不是幾百年前埋骨於此地的人所能想像的。風還是一樣的風，樹還是一樣的樹，而領略的人，却換了一　心　了。</p>
<p>的確，張家口，大同，綏遠，這些城都已經不是人們所想像的荒寒的邊塞，我第二次到綏遠，已經有近代的旅館，起居飲食，有時還許比沿江沿海的那些半進化都市更舒適些。就是第一次去的時候，鐵路剛通到包頭，而沿路所吃的巳經有南方的口味，並不是一定要吃筱麥麵。晚上一樣可以享受電燈，以及他連類而及的都市娛樂。天下事有許多容易由想像而誤會的，其實就在幾百年前，這些地方也並不能算荒塞的邊塞，尤其大同，正是明朝軍事的重鎭，許多人過着優裕豪奢的生活，竿羔美酒，妙舞清歌，除了民間故事所傳播者而外，還有些實物的遺迹可尋，比如大同的民房至今還在門樓上竪着鴟吻，據府志上說，就是明代軍官住宅留下來的習慣。但是一代的豪華又過去了，他們在地下看着後幾代的人，不知究竟是進步，還是退化呢？</p>
<p>這些城之中，最動人欣賞的，據我看還是綏遠。綏遠有新舊兩城，其建置年代都不狠遠，廓大而雄壯，想見當日長駕遠馭的精神，所以街市坊巷的布置，都開展而有餘裕，絕沒有他處商埠的惡習。每當星月澄輝之夜，步行街頭，上面有迎風披拂的楊柳，下面有皎潔淸澈的溝渠，而又有平坦堅固的路，映着稀疏的電燈，使人感覺北土的廣漠，給後來者以無窮開拓的希望。</p>
<p>居民誠然相當的苦，但是自淸季放墾以後，已經利用水道，開闢田時，遊牧遺風漸已不見。而且生活簡單，夏委有兩件布衣，冬季一件羊皮襖，就彀了。氣候　潔，人烟不多，衛生上的設備需要也很少。</p>
<p>由漢至唐，這些本來都是郡縣，宋以後因沒於異族，中原的人漸漸忘懷了。從今　後，應當把邊塞的觀念除去，再去追尋漢唐盛時才對。</p>

<h3>詩談片</h3>
<p>— 林風</p>
<p>現代的詩，是用活潑潑的語言，寫活潑潑的生活，寫人民的痛苦，憤怒，願望和企求。</p>
<p>現代的詩，不再是搖頭幌腦的吟咏，或是在風前月下充一充風雅，它是飽含着血淚的生活畫，迫使讀者拿出自己的良心，接近眞理的陽光。</p>
<p>現代的詩，不再是一種軟弱的呻吟，它是我們向黑暗搏鬥的武器，當寒冷季節，它給我們以溫暖；當黑夜裏，它給我們以光亮；當寂寞時，它燃出遙遠的希望；常我們在汚穢中行走，它使我們把周圍感染得純淨起來。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一�血141</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>再者，特務工作的人，也如軍事家的行軍行動一般，要「靜如處女，出如脫兎」。鶴見這時的舉動，應該靜，無論如何應該靜；因他僅僅只聽到一個聲音，一句突如其來的話，無因無由也無果；所以他不能亂動，只想聽一點下文。但在聚會精神側耳傾聽的常口，他的學識，叫他悟到這個聲音，來得古怪，只是一種「心音」，所以他更用不到亂動了。</p>
<p>從這發話的口氣上說，當然可以斷定這說話的人是萍子。但萍子究竟在哪裹呢？不錯，萍子叫他「走動」，他似乎應當把這句話，當作一個嚴重的警告。但鶴見什　　侯聽過萍子的警告呢？他們第一次在「綠野」會面，萍子不是下過警告，呌他「快離東京」的嗎？就在今天電話裏，那萍子轉達靑木長老的警告，不是說過「搜尋秘緘的事必不成功」的嗎？鶴見可不是沒有聽她那一套嗎？</p>
<p>况且鶴見這時，明明不知道萍子在那要，料想萍子也絕對不知道他在這間客廳裹，那麼，這突如其來的一句警告，安知不是本人聽得萍子的警告太多，一次一次的貯藏在下意識裏，這時神經過度緊張之後，而又稍稍弛鬆的衰弱狀况下，才乘虛襲來的呢？所以說他這時簡直不必亂動。一動的話，那簡直等於剛從被兇鬼或惡戰迫逐的噩夢裹，醒轉的人，跳下床就往外跑，一樣的可笑。</p>
<p>可是鶴見雖然沒有拔脚就動，然而也沒有把萍子這個警告完全不放在心上。根據這兩天的經騐，他承認萍子這個鬼靈精，確也有些鬼這理。至少，還有靑木長老這個老魔術家有兩下障眼法。他也承認本人道時的處境，好比龍潭虎穴，確有不可測度的危險。無論你鶴見如何精明機警，無論如何計劃周到，自身如何的絕綠而不致被牽連，但近衛的手法不測，第五縱隊的無孔不入，安知不是他們預先採集了種種綫索，然後佈置下了天羅地網，讓鶴見自己情情願願地投入陷阱？</p>
<p>所以他一悟到那聲音是萍子傳來的一心音」，又悟到自己不該聚會精神，把潛在意識的活動停止了，於是立即又把情緒鬆弛，靜下心來，試試自己催眠，想回復到精神恍惚的狀態中去，想感應萍子，　給他一點什麼暗示。</p>

<h3>Ma Envoy Summoned to Return Home This Morning; Issues Departure Statement Before Leaving, Saying China Has Laid a Democratic Foundation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Conner, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy, announced on the morning of the 7th that Special Envoy Marshall had received instructions from President Truman to return home and report on everything. Special Envoy Marshall has decided to depart from Nanjing for the United States on an American military plane at 8:00 AM on the 8th. At noon on the 7th, Envoy Marshall hosted a banquet at his residence, inviting Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, Ambassador Stuart, and his personal advisor Fu Jingbo. It was also decided that Communist Party delegation secretary Zhang Wenjin would meet with him in the evening for discussions. Song Ziwen flew back to Nanjing from Shanghai at 4:00 PM and went to Envoy Marshall's residence at 5:00 PM for lengthy talks, reportedly regarding the $500 million loan. Many Chinese and foreign reporters visited Envoy Marshall today, requesting a farewell speech, but Envoy Marshall remained silent. Subsequently, several reporters from Nanjing and Shanghai jointly submitted a written inquiry with three questions, requesting an interview for answers. At that time, President Song happened to enter, and Marshall dispatched Deputy Adjutant Yin to meet with them, declaring: Envoy Marshall's return home is at the summons of President Truman and there is nothing else to report, therefore he does not intend to grant an interview, and there is no need to answer the three questions raised. President Chiang and his wife specially hosted a banquet at their official residence on the evening of the 7th to bid farewell to Envoy Marshall.</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 7th, Broadcast: President Chiang met with General Marshall tonight and informed him of China's democratic reform plan. Prior to this, President Song also visited Marshal Marshall this afternoon, explaining the administrative plans of the Chinese government and declaring that the Kuomintang's one-party rule, monopolizing power, has come to an end with the return of power to the people.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] For over a year, Envoy Marshall has tirelessly mediated the disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. After departing from Beijing this time, Ambassador Stuart Leighton will solely represent the United States in future negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. If the weather is favorable, Envoy Marshall, accompanied by Colonel Gose, will depart from Nanjing Airport tomorrow, likely taking a route via Honolulu to return to the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] Officials today confirmed that President Truman has telegraphed Special Envoy Marshall to return home to report on his duties. Envoy Marshall is expected to fly from Nanjing to Washington around Tuesday of this week. When a reporter asked President Secretary Ross whether Envoy Marshall would still return to China, Ross replied: "I am not prepared to answer any questions, but Marshal Marshall's return home is an officially announced piece of news." According to the official announcement: "The President has telegraphed Marshal Marshall to return to Washington to personally report on the situation in China. He may depart from Nanjing as early as tomorrow."</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 7th, Broadcast: General Marshall's departure statement from China was released by the U.S. side today. The full text of the statement consists of 1,200 words. It is said that the Chinese government is about to reorganize its government in accordance with the new constitution. Marshal Marshall pointed out optimistically: "The foundation of a democratic China has already been laid." Marshal Marshall stated clearly that this peace talk was sabotaged by extremist elements and strongly condemned the malicious propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party, which distorted the facts in an attempt to incite the Chinese people and others to resentment and hostility towards the United States. Marshal Marshall believes that only the establishment of a free and democratic government can save China.</p>
<p>Marshall also said: The agreement reached by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party at the Political Consultative Conference a year ago was indeed a charter for democratic progress, sufficient to lay the foundation for China's peaceful reconstruction. It is a pity that stubborn elements within the Kuomintang still want to preserve their feudal forces and clearly have no sincerity in fulfilling the resolution.</p>
<p>Marshal Marshall pointed out that the biggest obstacle to peace talks is the mutual suspicion between the two sides.</p>
<p>Marshall further stated: "I express my views in extremely frank terms. This is the only way I can enable the American people to partially understand this complex issue. On the one hand, the leaders of the Chinese Kuomintang resolutely oppose a communist government. On the other hand, the Communist Party also frankly admits that they are Marxists. Although they may initially agree to the establishment of an Anglo-American-style democratic government, their aim is still to establish a communist government."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Zhang Wenjin, the English secretary of the Chinese Communist Party delegation, went to meet Special Envoy Marshall at about 5:00 PM on the 7th at the latter's invitation. Since Zhang had been in contact with Envoy Marshall from time to time during the Kuomintang-Communist peace talks over the past year, he went to meet and talk with him for nearly an hour before his departure. However, Envoy Marshall only made a general statement, saying that all issues would be discussed after returning to the United States. This may refer to the fact that a formal reply from the U.S. government will be determined after a report to Washington.</p>
<h3>Military Mediation Department Personnel Talk; Marshall Will Still Return to China; Policy Towards China Unlikely to Change</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 7th] Reactions from the Military Mediation Department regarding Marshall's return home: (1) Zheng Jiemin, a government member of the Military Mediation Department, told reporters: Marshal Marshall's return home is to report on the situation in China to Congress. He believes that the United States will not change its policy towards China, and there is no possibility of changing the mediator, because the United States currently has no more suitable candidate than Marshal Marshall. (2) Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Department, told reporters: I had heard before that Marshal Marshall was about to return home, so I am not surprised at all. He predicted that Marshal Marshall would still return to China to continue mediating, and the Military Mediation Department would continue to exist. He denied the rumors that the Military Mediation Department would be cancelled. (3) Ye Jianying, the Communist Party member of the Military Mediation Department, told reporters that there had been rumors for a long time that Marshall would return home, but after receiving Truman's telegram on the 6th, he immediately departed for the United States, and his hurried departure was indeed noteworthy. In his judgment, Marshall's return home was prompted by two situations: First, the recent victories of the Communist army in Shuyang, Taierzhuang, and other places have made the U.S. government feel that the problem cannot be solved by force. Second, the incident of a 19-year-old Chinese girl being raped, which caused a major national disturbance in China, must have made the U.S. government realize that their policy towards China has angered the Chinese people. This time, Truman recalled Marshall, probably to hear a report on the situation in China and re-examine the policy towards China. As a result, there are only two possibilities: either further strengthening the wrong policy towards China, or making some limited changes to the policy towards China. In answering reporters' questions, he believed that the Military Mediation Department no longer made sense. Marshall and Robertson have left, and only we are still supporting it here. In fact, we should have packed our bags and left long ago. He believes that there is no basis for resuming peace talks now.</p>
<h3>After Marshall Returns Home; Rumors Suggest He Will Be Appointed Secretary of State</h3>
<p>Policy Towards China May Change</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 7th] According to Reston, the Washington correspondent for the New York Times, after Marshal Marshall returns home, Washington will inquire about the situation in China and whether he will stay in Washington for a long time. If it is permissible, he will be invited to serve as Assistant Secretary of State, and further replace Byrnes as Secretary of State, as the latter intends to retire.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] Well-informed sources here recently detailed the recall of U.S. Special Envoy to China Marshall. Briefly stated, after Marshal Marshall consults with President Truman, the State Department, and leaders of the new Congress, the United States will draft its new policy towards China.</p>
<h3>Democratic League Continues to Meet</h3>
<p>Determines That the League Is Still a Political Group</p>
<p>[Our Report] The Second Plenary Session of the Democratic League held its third meeting yesterday morning. Chairman Zhang Bojun made a detailed review of the work in the meeting. The fourth meeting continued in the afternoon, chaired by Zhang Shenfu. The Review Committee submitted eight proposals and twenty-eight points of opinion regarding the organizational part. Regarding the organization of the Democratic League, there are three important decisions: (1) Regardless of whether they have party affiliation, those participating in the Democratic League do so in their individual capacity. After joining the League, they must abide by the League's political views and resolutions; otherwise, they are requested to withdraw from the League. (2) It is determined that the Democratic League is an unarmed group that realizes democracy. (3) The nature of the Democratic League is still a political group, absorbing democratic elements from all strata, rather than a single political party.</p>
<h3>National General Budget</h3>
<p>May Be Submitted to the National Defense Council for Discussion Next Week</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The National Defense Council's Committee for Reviewing the National General Budget for the 36th Year held a meeting at the National Government at 4:00 PM on the 7th. Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, Xu Kan, and many other relevant leaders attended. Chairman Wang Chonghui discussed it based on the Resident Committee of the Political Council's general review report on the general budget. A part of it has been accepted, and a part will be reviewed. The Review Committee has come to an end, and the general budget is expected to be submitted to the National Defense Council for discussion next week.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Mongolian Representatives Petitioned the Executive Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Twelve National Assembly Mongolian representatives, including Wu Yunpeng, petitioned the Executive Yuan at 11:00 AM on the 7th, raising four requests: (1) Restore the Mongolian Autonomous Political Affairs Committee; (2) Implement the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session regarding border ethnic issues; (3) Allocate 10 billion to relieve the three million Mongolian compatriots who have withdrawn from Nenjiang to Xinjiang; (4) Reorganize the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. Secretary-General Jiang Menglin met with them on behalf of the Executive Yuan. After listening to the reports of the representatives, he immediately stated that the issue of relief could be dealt with at his discretion, and other issues would be forwarded on their behalf.</p>
<h3>Reception for Chinese and Foreign Reporters</h3>
<p>Central Propaganda Department to Hold Separately Today</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Central Propaganda Department is scheduled to host foreign reporters at 3:00 PM on the 8th and Chinese reporters at 4:00 PM. The location is the conference room of the department on the sixth floor of the Guohuo Building.</p>
<h3>New Difficulties Added to Peace Talks; Zhang Qun Held Lengthy Talks with Zhang Junmai, Zuo Shunsheng, etc. Yesterday, Exchanging Opinions on the Current Situation from Various Aspects</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, City News] At 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Zhang Qun and Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party, Zuo Shunsheng and Li Huang of the Youth Party, had a lengthy talk at a certain place, exchanging opinions on the current situation from various aspects. The government reorganization issue, which is currently attracting social attention, and the issue of restoring peace talks were all touched upon. The analysis was quite detailed, but no conclusions were reached. Zhang Qun also hopes to continue the talks in the coming days. The rumor that Zhang will return to Beijing in the coming days is completely inaccurate. A reporter visited Zuo Shunsheng, a spokesman for the Chinese Youth Party, at 8:00 PM yesterday and asked various questions. Zuo answered them one by one as follows:</p>
<p>Q: I heard that you have met with Zhang Qun. Can you tell me about the content?</p>
<p>A: The scope of the discussion was very broad, covering the restoration of peace talks, government reorganization, and General Marshall's return home.</p>
<p>Q: What is your opinion on the peace talks?</p>
<p>A: We have always advocated continuing to solve the Chinese Communist Party issue through political methods. Although some new difficulties have been added at present, there is still a way to solve it if all parties can pay attention to reality.</p>
<p>Q: What is your party's opinion on government reorganization?</p>
<p>A: This issue is extremely complex and needs to be seriously considered. We believe that the concrete method of solving the current situation is more important than whether or not to participate in the government. We are conducting a detailed exploration of the key to solving the current situation, and there are no conclusions that can be reported.</p>
<p>Q: What are your feelings about Marshall's return home?</p>
<p>A: We are very impressed with General Marshall's mediation efforts for China over the past year, and we believe that his hard work has not been in vain. China's peaceful reunification and democratic construction are still valued by friendly countries. The U.S. policy may have some technical modifications, but the basic spirit will not change. We hope that because of Marshall's return home, the United States can further enhance its understanding of the Chinese issue.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Important figures from the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party have been visiting each other for days, exchanging opinions on the current situation and the issue of government reorganization. At noon on the 7th, the Youth Party held a banquet at the International Hotel for all the Standing Committee members of the Democratic Socialist Party, which did not end until 2:00 PM in the afternoon. It is said that it was only "a social gathering."</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Jiang Yuntian, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, returned to Beijing from Anhui on the 6th and is scheduled to go to Shanghai by military plane on the night of the 7th to participate in the organizational committee of the Democratic Socialist Party. Jiang visited Shao Lizi today. A reporter visited Jiang tonight and asked him to express his views on Special Envoy Marshall's return home. According to him, Special Envoy Marshall has made his greatest efforts in our country's peace negotiations over the past year. Although he has not succeeded, he has really done his best. Therefore, I hope that he can come to China again. Also, Yu Chao, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, traveled to Shanghai in the same car as Jiang.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Bojun gave a general discussion on the overall situation to our reporter, believing that the basic work at present is not how to reorganize the government, but for the government to wholeheartedly study the issues of peace talks, ceasefire, and overall unity and cooperation. In order to avoid the division of China, a new basis for peace talks must be found. This requires people from all walks of life to pool their wisdom and provide opinions, and to strive in the direction of reducing the difficulties of peace talks, and not to move in the direction of increasing difficulties. Regarding Special Envoy Marshall's return to the United States, he said: Marshall returned home because he felt the mediation mission was difficult. He hopes that the overall situation in our country will not worsen after his departure. It is best for the Chinese to solve their own problems independently.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Sends Personnel to Qingdao to Handle the Aftermath of the Accident; Dai Anguo Comes to Shanghai to Inspect the Equipment of the Two Companies</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Gao Dajing, director of the business group of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), flew to Qingdao at 11:00 AM on the 7th with American personnel from the company's aviation group to handle the aftermath of the victims of the CNAC's No. 121 aircraft that crashed in Qingdao and the pilots. At present, the company has not received a detailed report on the exact extent of the aircraft's damage. How to bury the corpses, transport the coffins, and other related issues will all be decided after Gao arrives in Qingdao.</p>
<p>According to the company's spokesperson, the details of the plane crash will be reported to the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications for expert study to determine responsibility.</p>
<p>[Our Report] Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications, is scheduled to come to Shanghai from Beijing today to inspect the flight equipment of China and Central Aviation Corporation.</p>
<p>Shen Dexie, General Manager of CNAC, and Chen Zhuolin, General Manager of CATC, were ordered by the Ministry of Communications to go to Beijing to report and arrived in Beijing yesterday morning. In addition to reporting the recent plane crash situation, they will also discuss improving various civil aviation issues.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, City News] The Snow Relief Committee, organized by the relatives of the passengers who died in the plane crash on Christmas Day, held its first meeting of the Standing Committee at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. More than ten people, including Le Junwei, Zhou Zhongdi, and Lu Linping, attended and immediately resolved to request the court in the name of the committee to file a lawsuit and legally investigate and deal with the company authorities. The resolution was also telegraphed to the Ministry of Communications and other relevant agencies for record. Other matters will be discussed at the second meeting to be held on the 11th (Tuesday).</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Thoroughly Investigates the Cause; Affixes Responsibility for the Accident</h3>
<p>And Discusses Flight Safety Measures</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Chen Zhuolin and Shen Debian, the General Managers of CNAC and CATC, arrived in Beijing together from Shanghai at 10:30 AM on the morning of the 7th. Then at 12:00 PM, they rushed to the Ministry of Communications to meet with Li Jinghuang, Director of the Navigation Affairs Department, and Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration, to report on the investigation of the Shanghai air crash case on Christmas and the handling of the previous Qingdao air crash case, and to discuss ways to improve flight safety in the future. Afterwards, Director Dai told reporters. He will take a military plane to Shanghai on the night of the 7th to conduct a final investigation of the Shanghai air crash case. Although the two companies bear huge losses due to the Ministry of Communications' order to suspend passenger flights for one week except for cargo and mail, it is irreversible. It is necessary for the aviation industry to frequently check aircraft and airport equipment to make planned improvements, and it is also a guarantee for the safety of passengers. Dai also stated that the Ministry of Communications attaches great importance to the recent series of plane crashes and is determined to thoroughly investigate the causes and affix responsibilities. However, before the investigation is completed, I hope that all parties will not make too many speculations.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 7th] After the CNAC plane crashed continuously, public opinion here was critical, believing that the transportation authorities had failed to inspect the equipment in advance, and the temporary order to suspend flights was somewhat abnormal. They also warned the two companies to improve the equipment at Wuchang Airport or relocate as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>U.S. Note to China and the Soviet Union; Urges Opening of Dalian Port and Restoration of Traffic on the China Changchun Railway</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 6th] The U.S. government believes that Dalian Port, which is currently occupied by the Soviet Union, should be reopened to international trade under Chinese management in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Agreement of August 1945, and there is no reason to delay it further. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow delivered this intention in a diplomatic note to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 3, and a similar diplomatic note was delivered to the Chinese government at the same time. The content of the diplomatic note is as follows:</p>
<p>"Regarding the status and management of the seaport of Dalian, the current situation is very unsatisfactory. The U.S. government believes that this matter should be considered by the Chinese and Soviet governments as soon as possible in order to fulfill the section of the Sino-Soviet Agreement of August 14, 1945, concerning Dalian. The U.S. government believes that the port should be reopened to international trade under Chinese management in accordance with the above agreement, and there is no reason to delay it further. The U.S. government is well aware that this is a matter directly negotiated by the Chinese and Soviet governments. However, in terms of the general interests of the United States, it is necessary to raise this issue with the relevant governments of both parties. The U.S. government hopes that the current abnormal state in Dalian can be ended in the short term and that normal conditions can be restored so as to allow U.S. citizens to visit and reside in Dalian and conduct their legitimate work.</p>
<p>Regarding the above points, this government further hopes that China and the Soviet Union can restore traffic on the China Changchun Railway in the short term.</p>
<p>The agreement reached by China and the Soviet Union on the issues of Dalian and the China Eastern Railway, if implemented in the short term, will surely restore normal conditions in the Far East and benefit commercial activities in all aspects. Therefore, this government sincerely hopes that the Chinese and Soviet governments will ensure that the above steps can be taken in the short term."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] The State Department announced that the U.S. government has asked China and the Soviet Union to end Soviet military control in Dalian as soon as possible and reopen it to international trade under Chinese management without further delay. This is the first step taken by the U.S. official after the Soviet authorities refused to allow three U.S. civilians to land in Dalian on December 12 and ordered the U.S. Navy communication ship carrying the three to leave the port within 20 minutes. According to the State Department, the U.S. government simultaneously ordered its ambassadors to Nanjing and Moscow to deliver the note to the foreign ministries of China and the Soviet Union on January 3. The Soviet side ordered the U.S. ship to leave the port within 20 minutes after the ship had been moored for more than the 48-hour stipulated period. State Department officials believe that the Soviet Union's move was within its rights and were unwilling to criticize the nature of the so-called ultimatum and the order to leave the port within a limited time.</p>
<h3>Military Needs No Longer Exist; The Soviet Union Should Return Dalian Immediately; We Welcome the U.S. Note</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] After the U.S. State Department issued a note to China and the Soviet Union on the 3rd, hoping that the Sino-Soviet negotiations on the takeover of Dalian would be completed as soon as possible and the Sino-Soviet Treaty would be implemented so that Dalian would become a free commercial port under Chinese jurisdiction, all sectors of Beijing attached great importance to this. He Fengshan, Director of the Information Department and spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters who were inquiring about the official reaction to the matter in the afternoon of the 7th: "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already received this note, but it is not yet known whether Foreign Minister Wang will issue a statement on this matter or wait until the Sino-Soviet negotiations have a result before announcing it together."</p>
<p>[United Press, Beijing, 7th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today confirmed that it had received the U.S. note on the Dalian issue and expressed its welcome, believing that the U.S. move could promote the early return of Dalian to China. Although Foreign Minister Wang Shijie did not directly express his opinion, other officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: It is hoped that the Soviet Union will declare that the jurisdiction of Dalian will be transferred to China in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty. There is no treaty basis for the Soviet army's occupation of Dalian, but it was a temporary expedient measure taken by the military authorities at the time due to the needs of the war against Japan. These military needs no longer exist. The relations between the United States, China, and the Soviet Union on this entire issue are related to the treaty, and there is no dispute. China hopes that the Sino-Soviet Treaty and the Sino-U.S. Treaty can be implemented as soon as possible. China does not intend to take any action regarding the U.S. note for the time being before the Soviet Union expresses its attitude in Moscow. Note: After Japan's surrender, the Soviet government notified the Chinese government on May 23 last year that the Soviet army had completely withdrawn from the three northeastern provinces, which proves that Moscow believes that the war against Japan has ended.</p>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 7th, Broadcast: The U.S. government has taken a tough stance on the Dalian issue, and U.S. newspapers have unanimously praised it. The New York Times said: The State Department's action has reversed its original attitude, restored the U.S. open door policy towards China, and opposed a certain power from seizing privileges from China.</p>
<h3>Lu Nan Communist Army Offensive Stalled; Fierce Attacks on Yixian and Taierzhuang Fail; 5,000 Communist Troops Flee into Hao County, Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 7th] Since Chen Yi led a force of tens of thousands of Communist troops to launch a large-scale offensive on the northeastern outskirts of Xuzhou starting on the 3rd, they have suffered heavy losses. On the 5th and 6th, they continued to fiercely attack strongholds near Yixian, Taierzhuang, Pixian, and Zaozhuang. The area east of the Taizao Line was the site of fierce, intertwined offensive and defensive battles day and night. By the 6th, due to the strengthening of the National Army's strength, the Communist Army's offensive began to stall.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 7th] Military News: The Communist armies in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu have recently launched a bandit-style campaign of harassment. The National Army on all fronts has been forced to adopt self-defense tactics, and the fighting is taking place in freezing weather. Details are as follows: (1) The Communist troops advancing along the Taizao Line to spy on Taierzhuang, after capturing Xiangcheng (formerly the ancient state of Xiang), were blocked by a powerful unit of the National Army, and their offensive momentum was slightly reduced. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army near Yishan. The Communist troops on this line have suffered nearly 10,000 casualties in the last three days. Taierzhuang, one of the cities that resisted the war, is now heavily guarded by a large force of the National Army and is safe. The Hezhao Line (Taierzhuang to Zhaozhuang Station on the Longhai Railway) is still under the control of the National Army. (2) The Communist troops who bypassed Zaobing to the northwest and attempted to invade Maziyangzhuang on the west bank of the Grand Canal, after being intercepted and attacked by the National Army's Huang Division and Liang Brigade along the way, are now fleeing back to Qushe and Lujia Dashe. This group of Communist troops is attempting to break up into smaller units and flee to the mountainous areas of the Jiangsu-Anhui border area and Honghu to establish new bases. (3) Gaodunbu has been turned from danger to safety. The National Army stationed in Nanxinan Town is protecting refugees from Shuyang returning to their hometowns and advancing towards Shuyang. The Communist troops in Shuyang are showing signs of wavering. (4) The elite troops of the National Army's Liang Bo Department have arrived at the port. A small group of Communist troops who attempted to sneak attack the port and cut off the Kotai Highway were reported to be harassing the border between Jingtai on the front lines. The National Army on that line has now been ordered to implement the "Qingxiang" (clearing the countryside) policy.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 7th] More than 5,000 troops of the Communist Army's Wei Fenglou Department have fled into Hao County in northern Anhui, posing a threat to the county seat.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 7th] On the 6th, the National Army in Lianshui advanced and stationed in strongholds such as Wugangkou and Daxingji. The Communist troops in Nanxinan Town wavered and retreated to the Dayishan (east of Shuyang) area. The National Army entered Nanxinan Town that evening.</p>
<h3>Signs of Communist Army Moving Inland from Outside the Pass; Four Brigades Flee into Eastern Hebei; Communist Army in Western Shanxi Attacks Puxian and Daning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] Sources say: there are signs that the Communist army is transferring a part of its main force from outside the pass to inside the pass. Four new brigades have arrived from outside the pass in the area of Shangwuling and Xinglongshan, forty li north of Ninglu Xingchazitou in northeastern Hebei, and there is a trend of advancing southward. The anti-traitor work in eastern Hebei, which is underway, is therefore being constrained. The Communist army formation on the Songhua River in the northeast has recently shown signs of dispersing. The so-called "winter offensive" seems to be a thing of the past. Small guerrilla units are now active again. The large army that had gathered along the north bank of the Songhua River in areas such as Taolaizhao, Xiushuidianzi, and Shulan has gradually left recently.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 6th] Military News: It is rumored that most of the Communist troops in Taolaizhao have retreated to Shuangcheng. If this is said to be preparation for abandoning Harbin, it is still too early.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Gaiping, 7th] For the past three days, the reporter has been traveling in areas of the Liaodong Peninsula where the Communist army uses dispersed and assembled tactics. The National Army in Dashiqiao, Gaiping, and Xiong Yue is on high alert, so it is still peaceful. Currently, both sides are continuing to have relatively fierce conflicts in the area north of the Fuxian Tongpiziwo Highway in southern Liaoning. The China Changchun Railway was rushed to repair in the howling cold wind towards Pulandian, and the ice and snow were everywhere, making it extremely difficult.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th] The Communist army in western Shanxi has now increased to ten brigades, a total of 50,000 to 60,000 people. Together with the coerced militia, there are about 100,000 people, divided into attacks on Puxian and Daning. The National Army stationed in Jinggou Town has encountered a fierce attack. The Communist troops attacking Puxian were repelled on the 3rd. Currently, the war in that direction is becoming increasingly tense, which is obviously a new offensive attempt by the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, GuiSui, 6th] The Communist army entered Qingshuihe on the afternoon of the 3rd and has been there for three days. The situation in the city is unknown. It is rumored that the defending regiment commander, Chen Zengfu, was killed in action. Only two county government personnel escaped, and the rest were captured. Currently, the Communist army's outpost is at Liu Si Yaozi, and the National Army's reinforcements have rushed to Tuchengzi. In addition, the two Communist army units of Kang Jianmin and Huang Ziqing from Zuoyun, totaling 1,500 people, entered the vicinity of Tiancheng Village in Liangcheng on the evening of the 5th. At night, the Fengliang telephone line was temporarily destroyed, but communication was restored this morning. As of the time of sending the telegram, there were no signs of continuing to flee north.</p>

<h3>Gui Yongqing Arrives in Guangzhou to Inspect Naval Institutions and Handle Received Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 7th] Vice Admiral Gui Yongqing, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, arrived in Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 6th with a group of eleven people, including Mr. Modang, head of the US Naval Advisory Group. Mr. Gui met with reporters from this newspaper at the Friendship Association and said: the task of this trip is to inspect the Guangdong naval institutions and affairs, and to handle the naval ships and materials received in the Guangdong area. There are currently many damaged ships that need to be repaired urgently. At the same time, there is a great lack of naval talents in Guangdong Province, and most of them do not meet the requirements. Most of them will be transferred to Qingdao for training. Mr. Gui also said: Guangdong Province is a key point of national defense in South China, especially the situation on Hainan Island is the most critical. The headquarters of the naval base has now been established in the national construction area. It is possible to establish naval bases in Yulin and Huangpu on Hainan Island. The great future of the Chinese Navy really depends on extensively mobilizing outstanding young people to join the navy to enhance national defense capabilities. Mr. Gui will go to Huangpu for inspection on the 8th and fly to Hainan on the 9th.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Dike in the Communist Area Has Not Been Repaired; It Will Be Extremely Dangerous When Officially Released; The Water Flow in the Old Course Has Reached the Territory of Heze County</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] According to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission's report to the Water Conservancy Committee on the recent situation of the Yellow River blockage and dike restoration project: on the Huayuankou blockage side, after the old line piles of the mouth were connected on December 11, a large amount of stone was thrown. The mouth is now only 200 meters wide and 2 to 3 meters deep. After widespread stone throwing, the water level has gradually increased. Since December 27, a part of the water has flowed into the old course. On January 1, the head of the diversion canal reached the border of Kaifeng, the water level is about 45 cm, the width is 30 meters, and the flow rate is slightly more than one mile per hour. On the dike restoration side, our dike sections have been completed one after another, only near the Communist-controlled area, they are often obstructed, construction is difficult, and it is impossible to complete as scheduled. The restoration of the dike sections within the Communist area is far from the originally planned standard. It is heard that some even flatten the entire dike section, completely losing its flood control effect, and some have not been repaired at all. The dangerous situation when the entire line is officially released in the future is self-evident.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 7th] According to people from the front line in western Shandong: the water flow in the old course of the Yellow River has reached the territory of Heze County, but the water is very small, only a few meters wide. The old course of the Yellow River is desolate, with very few people. The Communists claim that residents who have moved from the old course are asking the central government for huge sums of money, which is actually another attempt. Since the Communist army captured Juye and Jiaxiang, they have been actively operating along the old course of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>The Delay in Responsibility Lies Entirely with the Communist Party</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Funds for Riverbed Residents; 15 Billion Distributed</h3>
<p>The Delay in Responsibility Lies Entirely with the Communist Party</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Regarding the allocation of relief funds for riverbed residents in the Yellow River blockage and dike restoration project, Communist Party representative Dong Biwu publicly accused the government of failing to quickly pay the funds when he received reporters on the 6th. According to the person in charge of the Water Conservancy Committee to the reporter: For the relief of riverbed residents in the Communist-controlled area, the government specially allocated 15 billion yuan. On the 6th, Director Huo Baoshu of the Administrative Relief Executive signed the document with the Communist Party representatives stationed in Shanghai, and the funds will be transported to the area for distribution. The person in charge pointed out that the responsibility for the delay in transporting the funds for relief should be entirely borne by the Communist Party, because after the government approved the allocation of the funds last year, the Administrative Relief Executive specially discussed with the Communist Party to transport the funds directly to the riverbed area and distribute them door-to-door, and the Administrative Relief Executive, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Bureau, and the Communist Party each sent one person to participate in the distribution work. However, the Communist Party representative expressed disagreement and proposed that all the funds be handed over to the Communist Party representative for handling, and planned to purchase materials in Shanghai and transport them. The opinions were different and held until now. After several discussions, they finally followed the government's suggestion and signed the document in Shanghai. Now the funds will be transported and distributed by the Administrative Relief Executive, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Bureau, and representatives of the four parties from the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Dong Biwu Arrived in Shanghai Last Night</h3>

<h3>The Water Conservancy Association Replied to Dong Biwu, Explaining the Truth about the Blockage Project; It Hopes That the Communist Party Will Value Public Opinion and Help Complete the Whole Effort</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Yellow River blockage and dike restoration project aims to save more than one million victims in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, and to restore the cultivated land of the vast majority of people. This project was planned and implemented by the government in response to repeated appeals and requests from the councils and people's organizations of Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces. According to the original plan, the first step is to block the mouth and restore the dikes, and the second step is to reorganize the flooded area. If the Yellow River is not returned to its old course one day, the flooded area will not be reorganized one day, which means that the more than six million victims who are displaced and homeless cannot return to their homeland one day. The Central Government cares about the people, and it is its unshirkable responsibility. If this project is not successful one day, it will not be able to face the people of the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. Moreover, the Huai River is invaded by the Yellow River, and the water conveyance efficiency is destroyed. If the Yellow River does not return to its old course one day, the Huai River will not be rectified one day. The severity of the damage is difficult to calculate. However, because a part of the old course of the Yellow River in the territory of Henan is occupied by the Communist Party, before and after planning and construction, the Central Government hoped that the Communist Party could do its best to assist in the smooth progress of the project. Although there were several consultations with the Communist Party, and agreements were reached several times, during the implementation, the Communist Party obstructed it anytime and anywhere, causing the progress of the project to be delayed again and again, and the completed projects were also repeatedly damaged. However, Communist Party representative Dong Biwu sent letters to the Water Conservancy Committee, the Administrative Relief Executive, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration on the 3rd, and received the press on the 5th to report on the Yellow River blockage and restoration project, which is expected to be successful soon, and attempted to distort the facts and shirk responsibility. The Water Conservancy Committee replied to Mr. Dong on the 6th, hoping that he would value the lives of the people, understand the Central Government's intention to save the people, and help to complete the blockage and restoration project as soon as possible. The letter also pointed out that it has recently been reported that the Communist Party has a plan to build dams across the river to prevent water from flowing downstream, which means that there is a danger of breaches occurring everywhere on both the north and south banks of the Yellow River, and the two provinces of Henan and Hebei will inevitably suffer another disaster. Therefore, the association specially warned that it hopes that this fact will not occur. If this kind of fact occurs after the blockage, the Communist Party should be responsible for the consequences. In addition, the Water Conservancy Committee gave point-by-point answers based on facts to the four opinions put forward by Mr. Dong:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding what Mr. Dong said: "(1) The work of releasing water must be stopped immediately, and the responsibility for releasing water must be investigated. If the blockage and water release are not stopped immediately, the lives and properties of millions of people downstream should be taken care of in accordance with past promises, and all personnel, materials, and equipment assisting the Yellow River blockage project from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration should be withdrawn immediately. (2) Because the government has destroyed the previous agreements on the Yellow River dike restoration project, the middle and lower reaches dike restoration project and the riverbed residents' relief have not been carried out for five months. Therefore, the Huayuankou blockage project must be postponed for five months, so that during this period, the middle and lower reaches dike restoration project and the relocation and relief of residents can be carried out quickly in accordance with the agreement" The association replied: "The record of the talks of the Chinese Communist Party representatives and the representatives of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Executive Relief Executive on May 18 of the year, the blockage project continues." Also, the Shan Communist Party representative put forward reservations, and the piles and stones should be piled up before Dafan, with no more than two meters beyond the bottom of the river. The so-called "continuing" is of course to continue without interruption of work, to the goal of completing the blockage. There is no doubt about it. Except that the limit of not exceeding two meters beyond the bottom of the river should always be maintained before Dafan, this restriction should no longer be imposed after Dafan. At present, the blockage project has continued to a considerable extent, and it should be completed in time. The Yellow River area spans the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, the area of the flooded area is more than 29,000 square kilometers, the number of displaced people is more than 6,100,000, the area of cultivated land submerged or damaged is more than 17,700,000 mu, and the annual loss of crops is more than 1,500,000 tons. The documents and telegrams from the governments at all levels and the people's organs of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu calling for the early blockage are flying in like snowflakes, and the international community is also concerned about this matter and paying close attention to it. In order to save 6,100,000 victims, restore 17,700,000 mu of cultivated land, and 1,500,000 tons of agricultural products per year, the Central Government must seek the early completion of the blockage project and cannot abandon its due responsibilities because someone is deliberately obstructing it. As for the allegation that the number of governments has violated the agreement, not only has the Central Government never abandoned the agreement in handling this matter, but on the contrary, the Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly destroyed important equipment in the Wangkui stone field, and used force to prevent border engineering and employees from entering the Communist-controlled area for work, and plundered and blocked the restoration materials, which is ironclad evidence of deliberate destruction.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding what Mr. Dong said, "The government's work funds must be paid quickly, and the minimum amount of 15 billion for the relief of riverbed residents should be delivered on schedule in accordance with the Shanghai agreement of July last year, and should not be delayed on the grounds of arrears." The association replied: "According to the recommendation of UNRRA consultant Todd for the dike restoration work funds in the Communist-controlled area, payments were made according to the work performance. 6 billion yuan was allocated to the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in June and July of last year for transfer. According to the report of consultant Todd's inspection of the dike restoration situation in the Communist-controlled area on August 1 last year, it is believed that the border government has received sufficient assistance, and the paid food is sufficient to pay for the costs of the completed project. The great letter said, obviously untrue. As for the teaching relief fee for riverbed residents, the Executive Yuan has approved a huge amount of funds, which will be handled by the Executive Relief Executive."</p>
<p>(3) Regarding what Mr. Dong said, "The distribution of the 66 billion yuan for the blockage and restoration project should be allocated fairly and reasonably according to the length of the dike line and the size of the project. The current allocation amounts stipulated by the Blockage and Restoration Bureau are obviously unfair, and we cannot agree." The association replied: "It should be based on how to use the blockage and restoration funds in accordance with the established plan, and the good and bad conditions of the dike are the basis for weighing the urgency of the project. There is no basis for the provision that the Communist-controlled area should account for 60%, and there is no record of this item in the agreement of May 18 last year."</p>

<p>Gaoan in Nanchang Has Relatively Good Performance</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 6th] The Jiangxi Provincial Political Inspection Team has now completed its mission and returned to the provincial capital. Chairman Wang Lingji specially convened a provincial political review meeting on the 6th, attended by the heads and members of the various teams. The first report submitted today was from the first team, which stated that Nanchang City and Gaoan County have better political achievements. The public teachers and staff in the counties have meager salaries. The township chiefs receive 20,000 yuan per month, and the Baojia chiefs are unpaid. The travel expenses for county government personnel range from 40 yuan to 500 yuan, which is not enough for a day's tea money, thus affecting personal integrity and work mood.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] In the case of Zhu Keming's rape and murder of his cousin, the Capital High Court has made repeated strict investigations and will schedule a court hearing soon. However, no matter what the case is, the Zhu criminal is likely to enjoy the luck of having his sentence reduced.

<h3>Please Implement the Agreement on Dalian Between China and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>The United States government, on the 3rd, simultaneously instructed its embassies in China and the Soviet Union to inform the Chinese and Soviet governments, requesting that China and the Soviet Union implement the agreement on Dalian in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, so that Dalian can return to normal under the administration of the Chinese government. The wording of this note is very mild and tactful, and solemnly declares: "The United States government recognizes that this issue should be resolved through direct negotiations between China and the Soviet Union, but for the general interests of the United States, the United States must consider itself responsible for raising this issue with the two governments directly concerned." It is obvious that this action by the United States does not constitute interference in the Dalian issue, and will not cause diplomatic problems between China, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Its sole motive is to hope that Dalian will return to normal as soon as possible, which should be welcomed by the people of China and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of receiving Dalian, General Zhao Gongwu, the representative of our country, had already conducted negotiations with the Soviet side. The Associated Press also once reported that three agreements had been reached: (1) After Dalian is taken over by the National Army, it will be opened as a free port, open to trade and shipping of all countries; (2) The Soviet Union will enjoy the privilege of renting wharves and warehouses; (3) The administrative power of Dalian belongs to the Chinese government. However, this widely rumored story has never become a reality. On the contrary, not long after, the incident of the Soviet military authorities in Dalian refusing to allow American reporters to land occurred. Although American public opinion attached great importance to this, the United States State Department, in order to cherish the friendly relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, always adopted a "compromising" attitude, unwilling to expand this incident, and even claimed that the Soviet Union's actions were "legal actions," only expressing a wish: "According to the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of August 1945, Dalian is a free commercial port and should be under Chinese administration; however, the Chinese and Soviet governments have not yet agreed on the handover method, so Dalian is still under Soviet military control. The United States government hopes that they can agree on the handover method as soon as possible, but still recognizes that this matter should be resolved through direct negotiations between China and the Soviet Union." Therefore, the fact that the Dalian incident did not cause a major international political storm must be attributed to the United States' enlightened and prudent attitude.</p>
<p>Putting aside all theories, let us consider it from a legal point of view. Dalian should have been taken over by China long ago and opened as a free port, open to trade and shipping of all countries. There is really no reason why this matter has not been resolved. According to a report by American journalist Newton, the Soviet Union has another interpretation of Article 4 of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance regarding the Dalian Agreement: "During the war, Dalian is not included in the scope of the military base regulations stipulated in the Lushun Agreement of August 14, 1945, and is only subject to the military control set by the region during the war against Japan," believing that China and the Soviet Union are still at war with Japan and will not end until the peace treaty with Japan is signed. Therefore, the Soviet Union intends to retain complete control over Dalian and wants to retain troops in Dalian until the peace treaty with Japan is signed. The Soviet Union's view of the treaty is a misunderstanding, and an unwarranted misunderstanding. This is very obvious.</p>
<p>First, there is no treaty basis for the Soviet Union to station troops in Dalian. It was only an agreement reached between the commanders of the Chinese and Soviet armies during the war, allowing the Soviet Union to use Dalian as a base for the war against Japan. Now the war against Japan has ended a long time ago, and it has been almost a year and a half. The Soviet army no longer needs to use Dalian as a base, and there is no need to stay in Dalian.</p>
<p>Second, the agreement on Dalian also stipulates the phrase "during the war against Japan." Although the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been signed, it cannot be considered "during the war against Japan." According to international law, after Japan surrendered, the "period of war against Japan" has passed, which is completely different from "wartime conditions." Moreover, the United States has also announced that the "wartime state" has ended since the beginning of this year!</p>
<p>Third, the Soviet government informed the Chinese government on May 23 last year that all Soviet troops had withdrawn from Northeast China. The Soviet government believes that the war against Japan has ended, which can be clearly proved in this note. What reason does the Soviet Union have to refuse to hand over Dalian to the Chinese government?</p>
<p>In short, China and the Soviet Union are the two major stabilizing forces in the Far East. Whether for the sake of their own interests or for the sake of the future of the Far East and even the entire world, they should maintain friendly relations and cooperate closely. The diplomatic policy adopted by the Chinese government is also based on this unchanging keynote. When the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed the year before last, the Chinese government did not hesitate to use Lushun as a joint military base for China and the Soviet Union as the price for obtaining Soviet friendship. This is the most powerful proof. Since then, for the past year and a half, the Chinese government has恪守不渝 all treaties between China and the Soviet Union. At the same time, it has exhausted all diplomatic means in successive international conferences, always hoping that China can truly become a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, so that they can cooperate and not go their separate ways. It is unwarranted for the Soviet Union to misunderstand China. Therefore, we hope that the Soviet Union can reflect on itself, cherish the traditional friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and earnestly fulfill all treaties between China and the Soviet Union. If this can be done, not only can all outstanding issues between China and the Soviet Union be easily resolved, but also the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union can also improve accordingly. We sincerely hope that the relationship between China, the United States, and the Soviet Union will become clearer and brighter as the Dalian issue is resolved satisfactorily!</p>
<h3>Prospects of the American Political Situation</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the 80th Congress of the United States on the 3rd of this month, all parties have been looking forward to President Truman's address, announcing the policies that the United States will adopt in domestic and foreign affairs in the future. This important address was personally delivered to Congress by President Truman on the 6th, and Republican members expressed satisfaction with it. As Republican Senator Vandenberg said, "President Truman's address was worded mildly and tactfully, and was unanimously approved by Republican members. The President's arguments on the relationship between the White House and Congress are also reasonable." Republican Senator Halleck also said: "The Republican Party is also willing to cooperate with President Truman to achieve a fair resolution of American problems, and believes that the Republican and Democratic parties in the House of Representatives will be able to work together harmoniously." It can be seen that President Truman's speech has received a good response in the United States. From this, it can also be expected that President Truman will not have disagreements with Congress before his term expires and cause a major political upheaval. This cannot but be said to be a gratifying phenomenon in the future of American politics.</p>
<p>After the Republican Party won the victory in the re-election of the United States Senate last year, everyone was worried about President Truman. After the opening of the 80th Congress, the White House and Congress would not be able to live in peace, and open and covert struggles would be inevitable. Therefore, the American political situation was likely to fluctuate at any time. Until the eve of the opening of the 80th Congress, there were indeed dangerous signs. The issue of Republican members advocating the expulsion of Democratic Senator Bilbo from the Senate for bribery was a complete mess. At the same time, as a result of the re-election of the speakers of the House of Representatives and the Senate, Vandenberg was elected as the Speaker of the Senate, and Martin was elected as the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Republican Party, which had been in the opposition for fifteen years, finally regained control of Congress. In addition, on the day that the newly appointed Speaker of the House of Representatives, Martin, was sworn in, he straightforwardly stated: "The current American system has made the United States the greatest country in history, and the American government should not tolerate those who favor the communist system." At that time, the cheers of the members were endless, and the House of Representatives was suddenly filled with anti-communism and anti-Roosevelt sentiments. How would President Truman deal with himself in this situation? Of course, this was a serious issue, especially how to word the first presidential address to be presented to the 80th Congress? This was an even more difficult problem!</p>
<p>However, President Truman's address was finally delivered, and it has been well received by all parties. One cannot help but admire President Truman's political wisdom. We summarize the full text and, in summary, the following items relate to foreign affairs: (1) The main interests of the United States and the Soviet Union depend on the rapid creation of world peace, so the United States and the Soviet Union should cooperate closely; (2) If the United States can continue to cooperate with other countries in a spirit of prudence and patience, it will surely create lasting world peace; (3) The United States will continue to provide economic assistance to countries affected by the war; (4) Before the hope of peace is realized, the US military cannot be reduced; (5) The United States recognizes Austria's independence and should clearly tell Germany and Japan their future destiny and boundaries; (6) It is hoped that atomic energy will only be used for peace, so that countries around the world can benefit from it; (7) The United States should maintain strong strength so that it can repel aggressive forces at any time; (8) The purpose of the United States is to seek collective security for all mankind. Regarding domestic affairs, there are also the following points: (1) The White House and Congress should cooperate with each other to pass labor laws to prevent labor unrest; (2) The new US labor law will establish the principles of negotiation and collective contracts; (3) The future of the American economy is very optimistic; (4) The government's financial budget, no matter how large the military expenditure is, must be able to achieve a balance of payments; (5) American youth should receive universal training; (6) Relief for veterans; (7) Fundraising for the Republican and Democratic parties to work together to avoid threats to national security.</p>
<p>Although the points mentioned by President Truman in his address do not have the far-reaching and lofty ideals of the policies adopted by the late President Roosevelt, they are still practical methods in reality. Under the current environment, President Truman can only adopt this policy to obtain the unanimous support of the Democratic and Republican parties. Post-war America is also a country where everything is waiting to be rebuilt. "Stability first" is the most urgent need for America today. It is necessary to find ways to solve all the problems facing America in a calm and peaceful atmosphere. President Truman's address finally brought temporary stability to the American political situation. Therefore, we cannot criticize President Truman's address with tinted glasses, nor can we immediately say that American politics is regressing. President Truman's success or failure depends on whether he can complete his mission under the joint support of the Democratic and Republican parties!</p>

<h3>Shocking Blood Case in Guhu Baimao Port: 16 Lives on the Ship Were Brutally Murdered; After Ten Days of Searching, the Criminals Have All Been Arrested</h3>
<p>[Pinghu News from Our Newspaper] Following the major cases of Jiapu car robberies, Jiapu pirates, and Xincang machine crew robberies in our county, another major blood case of the entire crew and passengers of the Shanyang shift Wei Jiafa sailing ship being brutally murdered has occurred. This sailing ship usually operates between Pinghu and Shanyang, carrying passengers and goods, and travels back and forth daily, and has always been safe and sound. Unexpectedly, on December 25th of last year, it carried rice wine and white rice, as well as ten passengers, and after leaving Pinghu, it did not return to Pinghu on the same day, and there was no news on the 26th. People began to suspect and searched everywhere, but to no avail. It was not until the 27th that the Lu Guiyou machine crew, which was traveling between Xincang, discovered the ship in the Baimao Port. When they approached to investigate, there was no one on the ship. They only saw messy clothes and blood stains in the cabin, which aroused suspicion. They wanted to tow it back to Pinghu, but they found three corpses hanging in the river at the end of the rope. They had no choice but to return to Pinghu with the corpses and the ship. The shipowner, Wei Aqi, was shocked and almost fainted when he heard the news. He identified the corpse as a crew member on the ship and immediately reported it to the security authorities, requesting that the case be investigated and solved. Since the occurrence of the case, the county police bureau has dispatched police officers overnight to investigate the scene of the incident and hired net boats to salvage the corpses. On the 28th, four corpses were salvaged, including three crew members and one young passenger. On the 29th, it was discovered that Chen Qichang, the squad leader of the East Lake Town National Guard, had also been killed. As such, the incident shocked the county far and wide. Unexpectedly, on the 30th, a nameless male corpse was found next to the Mopan Beach River, six miles away from the scene of the Shanyang shift incident. This further increased the mystery of the case. All parties speculated that another blood case had occurred, or that the thugs were creating a false alarm. However, after observing the thugs' meticulous planning and calmness, the atmosphere of terror became even more frightening. In total, there were six crew members and ten passengers who were killed in the entire case. Seven bodies have been found, and the remaining nine are believed to have been killed. The cries at the autopsy site shook the sky, and the scene was extremely tragic. The county government convened an emergency security meeting and stepped up the search for the bandits. After successive arrests of seven suspects, the entire case was solved by the county police bureau on the 4th of this month. The main ringleader, Yin Wenkui, was transferred to the bureau overnight and has confessed without denial. These bandits came from the Taihu Lake area. After the incident, they planned to escape in the original direction. After receiving the report, the police bureau rushed to pursue them overnight and intercepted a bandit ship at the junction of Pingjia and Song. There were four bandits from other provinces on board, and they were all captured in one fell swoop. According to the investigation and statement issued by the Five Towns National Guard of the urban area, Gu Wenkui was also involved in the yellow bean robbery near Yinjiazhai two weeks ago and another blood case in addition to the Shanyang blood case.</p>
<h3>Changshu Tax Collection Officials Repeatedly Murdered; Two Killed, One Escaped; Fierce Battle During the Suppression of Pirates at Xiaojin Mountain</h3>
<p>[Changshu News from Our Newspaper] Fei Kangkang, the Baoding (local security chief) of the sixth Bao (neighborhood) of Meili Zhenmen Township, who also served as a tax collection official, was suddenly invaded by more than ten bandits holding short guns on the morning of the 4th. Fei was tied up on the spot and brutally shot at the Luxiang Bridge Pier. The body has been collected by his family members and reported to the county government for arrest of the murderers. Also, the home of Xue Xiaofa, a tax collection official in Qiujiaba, Tangqiao Township in this area, was suddenly invaded by more than ten bandits before dawn on the 4th, attempting to kill Xue. Fortunately, Xue was alert and escaped from the back door. When the bandits saw that Xue was not there, they robbed property and left with a roar. Also, police chief Hu Lanteng and police officer Li Xiankui were ordered to accompany the public servants to Jiangxiang Township outside the South Gate to collect rent. They were ordered not to move by six or seven plainclothes people holding guns, and the guns carried by Hu and Li were confiscated and taken away. After investigation by the county government, police officer Li Xiankui has returned to the team with his gun, but 36 rounds of ammunition are missing. As of the 5th, the whereabouts of police chief Hu Lanteng were still unknown, and rescue efforts are underway. Also, it was suddenly reported on the 4th that Gao Sanzhen, the tax collection official of Wudu Fifty-Five Tu of Nan Yichang in this county, who had been collecting grain in the Dahe Township area for days, was murdered near Bridge No. 3 on Yangfu Road, and his body was lying next to the highway. However, Gao was still in the urban area on the evening of the 3rd, so it is feared that this is a false rumor, and no corpse was found near Bridge No. 3 on Yangfu Road. The county authorities have sent people to investigate the situation to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>[Songjiang News from Our Newspaper] Outside Jinshan Zui, a coastal area of this county, pirates often plunder merchant ships, so boatmen traveling there are all vigilant. One day at noon, Li, the squad leader of the Shanyang Security Detachment stationed there, arrested Chen Abao, a man suspected of being involved. After questioning him, it was learned that the pirate ship was near Xiaojin Mountain, and there was a Wenzhou firewood boat that had been looted. There were twelve bandits on the pirate ship, holding a total of eight or nine rifles and Type 38 Mauser pistols, and the ammunition was also quite abundant. The arrested Chen Abao, according to reports from passengers crossing the sea, is said to be the deputy leader of the pirates. The Caojing District Office immediately transferred the East Gate and other security teams and the stationed security detachment, and the police chief and police officers took sea boats to encircle and suppress them. Because the pirates opened fire to resist, the sound of gunfire was tight for a time, as if facing a major enemy. The pirates fled into the misty sea due to the disparity in strength. As a result, a Wenzhou firewood boat that had been hijacked and two crew members were intercepted. More than 200 dan of firewood were loaded on the boat. However, three other crew members on the boat were still taken away by the pirates. The arrested Chen Abao has been transferred to the County Military Law Office for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Commercial Loan: More Twists and Turns</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Suzhou on the 7th] All parties are eagerly requesting a commercial loan in Suzhou. There were some signs of it before, and it was expected that the commercial economy could be revived. However, recently, the national banks in this city suddenly stated that this loan had nothing to do with the mandatory rules set by the banking industry and that it would easily create opportunities for merchants to speculate and hoard goods, so they would not approve the loan. After the news was revealed, the Suzhou business community was panic-stricken. They were worried that the Lunar New Year was approaching, and the disappointment of the loan would inevitably lead to a collapse. The county chamber of commerce was deeply concerned about this. So, on the 7th, it urgently telegraphed the Joint Office of Four Banks, requesting relief.</p>
<h3>Discord Arises During the Newlyweds' Homecoming; Gunfire Display Reported as Robbery; Villagers Showing Off, a Bloody and Humorous Drama</h3>
<p>[News from Our Newspaper in Wuxing] Shao Shuqing, a resident of Shaojiawan, Huanzhu Township, in this county, hired a matchmaker to marry Gu Yunzhen (19 years old this year), the daughter of Gu Hongsheng, a farmer in Heshangdian, Xinshu Township. On the morning of January 3rd, a sedan was prepared from the groom's home to welcome her. After the wedding on the same day, according to the old custom, the groom and bride went to the bride's home on the same afternoon for the homecoming. On that day, the matchmaker, the wedding assistant, and relatives Wu Zhengxian, Yang Xizhi, Ye Gensen, Yan Shougen, and Shao Rongqing, and five others (each carrying a rifle), rode on a boat to the bride's house as guests. After seeing the bride's parents, they were about to eat the homecoming banquet. However, they were dissatisfied because the dishes were simple and inferior. After eating, the groom and others returned to the groom's home. Just as they were leaving the gate, there was a turtle painted on the wall, with the names of the groom and his two younger brothers written next to it. Wu Zhengxian and others, the escorting people, questioned the bride's father. They disagreed and started scolding each other. They escorted the bride onto the boat and started negotiations with the groom's family. The surrounding villagers gathered more and more. Seeing that the situation was not good, the escorting people got off the boat and left the shore. They took out the pre-hidden rifles and fired several shots to scare the villagers. Suddenly, the order was disrupted. People started beating gongs and shouting that there were thieves. Ye Gensen, one of the escorting people, was unable to board the boat in time and was still on the shore. Knowing that he was alone and weak, and fearing that he would be caught, he pulled out a pistol and fired a warning shot. One bullet hit Zhu Bingfa's hand, and blood gushed out. All the villagers believed that it was rare for the groom to dare to kill someone with a gun during the homecoming, so they were all outraged. They seized Ye Gensen, tied him up along with the pistol, and sent him to the township office for disposal. The boat carrying the groom feared that the villagers would chase them, so they fired shots all the way, firing more than sixty shots in total. The East Gate Water Police Team heard the sound and immediately led the police team to investigate. The villagers told them that robbers had robbed them and that the bandit ship had returned to Shaojiawan. Chen, the police captain, immediately joined the County Security Police Second Detachment to the village to assist in the arrest. They captured Wu Zhengxian and others, the escorting people, and the groom and bride, and ten others at the same time. They also searched the groom's house and found four rifles, one pistol, and eighty rounds of ammunition. They were all taken to the bureau for interrogation. The injured Zhu Bingfa was sent to the Gospel Hospital for treatment by the bureau. Onlookers lined the streets. The bride looked dejected. After questioning by the Water Police Headquarters, the bride was released on bail, and the others were transferred to the Second District Commissioner's Office for legal action.</p>
<h3>Different Wedding Customs: Team Members Recklessly Kill People</h3>
<p>[Qingpu News from Our Newspaper] The Chen family in Liantang Zhuanqiao Village married off their daughter on New Year's Day. The groom's house was in Yujiahui, Jiashan. In the afternoon, they came by boat to pick up the bride. According to the village customs, the wedding attendees threw mud from the rice fields at the groom's house to play a joke, called "throwing fa." As the boat was about to dock, the audience on the shore gathered and mud continued to fly. Four soldiers from the Yujiahui Self-Defense Force accompanied the wedding party from the groom's house. Since the customs were different, they misunderstood the situation and fired a warning shot. Zhou Chenglong was shot on the spot, and the bullet penetrated the back of his head, killing him instantly. Seeing the disaster, the crowd detained the four soldiers from the Self-Defense Force who caused the trouble and handed them over to the county government for legal action.</p>

<h3>Petition from Salt Farmers in Yuyao: Dissatisfied with Increased Salt Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from our Yuyao Correspondent] The An'dong Salt Field Office in this county recently received orders to increase salt prices.

During the meeting, the representatives expressed dissatisfaction with the salt affairs agencies for increasing salt prices and seeking profits through trickery. After the meeting, all the representatives petitioned the field office. It is reported that there were two main points of the petition: first, the price increase caused the salt farmers to lose as much as one billion yuan, and they demanded prompt compensation for the salt price; second, they demanded that the government abandon official operation, stop the organization of field and business offices, and quickly support the salt farmer cooperative to take over loan management.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Counties in Southern and Northern Shanxi to Handle Emergency Relief for Refugees</h3>

<p>Abundant Harvest of Zhejiang Sea Fishing Season; Excellent Maritime Security</p>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou, 7th] According to the person in charge of the Ningbo Fisheries Bureau, the winter fishing season in Zhejiang Sea has been more abundant than the first half of the year, but the low fish prices make it difficult for fishermen to make a living. Maritime security in the Dinghai District is very good, only robbery of fishing boats often occurs along the coast of Sanmen Bay and Xiangshan. As for the Ningbo fish market, due to the lack of funds, the effect of adjusting supply and demand and balancing fish quality is still minimal. The profit from February reached more than 30 million, of which 10 million has been used for fishing loans, and a fishermen's welfare society has been established.</p>
<p>Soaring Prices in Hangzhou; Rice Exceeds 70,000</p>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou, 7th] Commodity prices in Hangzhou have soared again recently, with rice being the most prominent, having exceeded 70,000. Flour followed suit, and gold prices also exceeded 10,000. Silk was slightly stable, but overall business was not very good, and turnover was much lower than last year. The tea stock in Hangzhou is no longer a problem, but the production and sales crisis of Zhejiang tea this year is greater than last year, so the General Construction Fourth Section decided to focus on the tea industry this year.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Rice Prices Rise Sharply; 92,000 per Shi</p>
<p>[Report from our Fuzhou Correspondent] Since the New Year, the 400,000+ citizens of Fuzhou, in addition to the revelry, feel a real threat. Fuzhou rice prices rose sharply amidst the New Year firecrackers, with high-quality white rice rising to 92,000 yuan per shi. Daily necessities also increased accordingly. According to acquaintances in the market, Fuzhou has Wenzhou rice imports and continuous supplies from the upper reaches of the Min River. In principle, rice prices should not fluctuate so much, indicating that the main reason is poor human planning.</p>
<p>Quack Doctor Diagnoses Illness; Two Needles Cause Death</p>
<p>[Report from our Jiaxing Correspondent] Lu Aizhen, a shocking case in Shimen, Chongde, was 15 years old. Due to poverty, she worked as a servant in the home of Xi Jiahui in Yangjiaqiao, South Gate, Jiaxing. Her mother also worked as a servant in the Ma family nearby. On the night of the 4th, Aizhen's nose and mouth bled. On the afternoon of the 5th, her mother accompanied her to Liu Futang's acupuncture and traumatology clinic on Zhongjie, North Gate, for treatment. Liu said that four needles were needed to cure the disease and charged 60,000 yuan. Aizhen's mother reluctantly agreed. Liu first gave an injection in her left arm, and then another injection in her right arm (intravenous injection). After more than ten minutes, the patient's face turned white and she fell down. Liu falsely claimed that this was a normal reaction after the injection and took the opportunity to escape. Liu's daughter-in-law also disappeared. Aizhen soon died. Her mother reported it to the police, who reported it to the local court's procuratorate to send someone for inspection. However, because the deceased still had a slight warmth in her heart at the time, a diagnosis could not be made. A search of Liu's medicine bottles could not determine what medicine caused the patient's death. An autopsy is needed to clarify the cause. Liu's whereabouts are unknown after being pursued by the police (according to Liu, he was originally a quack doctor and also caused a death case for extracting teeth before the Anti-Japanese War). The incident caused a sensation in the city, and the Zhongjie area was crowded with people vying to inquire about the situation.</p>

<p>Xia Guangyu Arrives in Xinxiang to Supervise the Repair of the Daocheng Railway</p>
<p>[Report from our Xinxiang Correspondent] Since the Daocheng Railway repair project started on December 14th, only about 15 kilometers have been extended westward from Xinxiang as of February 29th. The Ministry of Communications ordered the railway to complete the railway from Jiaozuo to Huojia before December 15th, but the repair results on both sides have not yet completed half of the work; the main reason is the lack of equipment, and the frequent appearance of the Communist army in Xiuwu and Huojia disrupts and hinders the progress of the work. Xia Guangyu, Director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, came to Xinxiang on December 24th to urge the progress of this section, so that it can be completed before the Lunar New Year, and went to Zheng on the 26th to visit the Longhai Road for friendship, because the relationship between the Ping and Long railways will become closer after the Yellow River detour, so Xia stressed the "Pinglong family" proposition.</p>

<h3>The Birth of Bengbu City - Special Correspondent Qian Mengchao</h3>
<p>[Report from our Bengbu Correspondent] Bengbu City, which has been in preparation for more than a year, was officially established on New Year's Day. The bright sunshine shines between Bengshan and the Huai River, and people feel that the weather is particularly warm, as if it is not the height of winter. Today, the day of the establishment of the Municipal Government, coincides with the promulgation of the new constitution. In an environment where flags are hung, colored ribbons are tied, and everything is renewed, it is filled with the pleasant emotions of more than 220,000 citizens.</p>
<p>Mayor Takes Office</p>
<p>Unveiling Four Guidelines</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM, in the dim morning light, the first mayor, Li Pinhe, inspected the civil servants of various municipal agencies, the police, and students of primary and secondary schools at the public stadium. At 10:00 AM, the city government establishment ceremony and Mayor Li's inauguration ceremony were combined with an enlarged New Year's Day celebration meeting held by various circles in the stadium. The New Year's Day celebration ceremony was presided over by Xia Wei, commander of the Eighth Pacification Area. At 12:00 noon, the city government hosted guests. The event was lively and considered a grand occasion. In the evening, the Xiasheng Drama School, which had recently arrived in Bengbu from Xuzhou, performed Peking Opera at the Victoria Theater on Huachang Street as entertainment for guests from all walks of life. After taking office, the new mayor unveiled four policy guidelines for this year: (1) stabilize social order, (2) strengthen municipal construction, (3) lay the foundation for constitutional government, and (4) develop the city's industry and commerce. If he can truly follow these established standards and implement them step by step, it is believed that Bengbu City will definitely have new and considerable achievements.</p>
<p>The slogan of building a new Bengbu has long been overflowing in the ears of citizens. There has been some performance during the preparation for the establishment of the city. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, everyone places great expectations on the newly established municipal government, hoping to establish some achievements with a new style for everyone to see.</p>
<p>Talking About the Past</p>
<p>The City is Messy, Dirty, and Foul</p>
<p>Speaking of the construction of Bengbu during the preparation for the establishment of the municipality, it is nothing more than engineering construction and public utilities, but they have not been fully demonstrated due to the limitations of business funding. Mayor Li told our reporter that Bengbu City was devastated by the enemy and puppets during the eight years of its fall. At the beginning of the recovery, the city was in a state of mess, dirt, stench, and destruction. The roads have been in disrepair for a long time and have no system to speak of, and most of them have not been paved. In particular, the width is not enough, resulting in traffic jams. There are no formal docks built on both sides of the Huai River, and it is inconvenient to transport goods up and down. Citizens arbitrarily build in the streets, and the city appearance is very untidy. There is no water supply system, and general drinking water is taken from shallow wells and rivers. The former tastes bitter, and the latter is turbid, both of which damage the health of citizens. There is also no formal drainage system. The old drainage ditches are not dredged, and there are still a few places where water flows through the streets, with a stench, which is extremely unsanitary. The power plant is insufficient due to the old machines, and only one-fifth of the city can get lights, with most of the city in darkness. Other public facilities such as vegetable markets are missing. From this, it can be seen that the city's engineering construction and public utilities have no foundation at all. Since the establishment of the Engineering Bureau, it has started to repair and rebuild, and formulated a plan based on the actual situation, and earnestly promoted it, hoping to gradually complete the construction of the new Bengbu City.</p>
<p>Repairing Roads</p>
<p>And Dredging Sewers</p>
<p>Mayor Li continued: Most of the existing roads in the city have been destroyed for a long time, or have not been paved. It is difficult to walk in rainy and muddy weather, and transportation is very inconvenient. In the past year, on the one hand, the old roads were selected for renovation and repair, a total of 800 meters of gravel pavement on Damalu, 890 meters of asphalt pavement on Ermalu, 900 meters of cinder pavement on Zhongrong Street, 750 meters of gravel pavement on Gongyuan Road, 240 meters of gravel pavement on Guofu Road, 550 meters of flagstone pavement on Taigu Road were completed, and 4,000 meters of the Banghuai Road in the suburbs, 2,200 meters of Lantian Road, and 800 meters of Banglin Road were repaired, with a total of 12,130 meters of urban roads renovated. On the one hand, new urban roads were opened up, completing 2,010 meters of cinder pavement on Zhongzheng Road (ie Victory Road), filling 2,961 cubic meters of earth, 930 meters of Latitude 4 Road, filling 4,256 cubic meters of earth, 120 meters of Zhongshan Road, filling 9,166 cubic meters of earth, 237 meters of the military station branch line, and 245 meters of Minsheng Road, with a total of 3,542 meters of new urban roads opened up. All streets without ditches, or newly opened roads, must add sewers, so a plan for dredging and building sewers was specifically formulated. It was started in October last year with work relief. By the end of the year, a total of 1,640 meters of old sewers were dredged, 2,000 tons of sludge were transported out, and 780 meters of new sewers were built.</p>
<p>Reinforcing the Huai Dike</p>
<p>Handling Flood Prevention and Drainage</p>
<p>Regarding the reinforcement of the Huai Dike in the city and the handling of flood prevention and drainage, Mayor Li also made a report, generally saying that the Bengbu city along the Huai area originally built a dike, in recent years the yellow water was a disaster, the dike body was mostly washed away, after the recovery, that is, to start reinforcement, the top of the dike is specified to be three meters wide, the outer slope is one to two, the inner slope is one to three, and the bottom of the dike is added one to five, on February 23 last year, work began, completing 5,300 meters of the Dong'an Dike, 4,256 cubic meters of earth, and 9,000 meters of the Huaibei Dike, 3,900 cubic meters of earth.</p>
<p>Last summer, the Yellow Flood Eastward, the Huai River surged, in mid-August, the highest water level reached 20.29 meters, breaking the highest record of previous years, the city was greatly threatened, in order to prevent the worst, a flood prevention brigade was established to rescue the dangerous embankment, lasting for three months, fortunately avoiding the collapse. At the same time, in order to prevent external water from backflowing into the city, gates were built and temporarily blocked at the sewer outlets in Laodajie, Xinchuantang, and Dawangmiao. However, due to the continuous rain, the low-lying areas of the roads in the West City area were deeply flooded. Pumping vehicles were set up and fire equipment was mobilized day and night to drain the water and maintain traffic in the city.</p>
<p>Renovating the Park</p>
<p>Effectively Reorganizing the Power Plant</p>
<p>Mayor Li also mentioned the construction and renovation of Zhongshan Park and the expansion of the power plant. After the victory, the population has increased sharply. In order to supply citizens with tourism, the filth in Zhongshan Park was first cleared, and then the roads in the park were repaired, flowers and trees were planted, the gates, walls, and pavilions were renovated, the fountain pool was repaired, the public sports field was rebuilt, and a public reading room was set up. In order to commemorate the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, a Victory Monument was built in the park, with both the upper and lower sides being carefully considered, with brick railings of 176 meters and flower walls of 182 meters, and a staircase was added. The completion ceremony was held on Double Ten Day last year.</p>
<p>During the enemy-puppet period, most of the original intact machines in the power plant were transported away, leaving only a part of the old machines to barely generate electricity. However, due to the old machines, the coal consumption was very large, so the plant was deeply in debt, and there was often a power outage. After the victory, in order to maintain the power supply, on the one hand, the Bengbu City Power Plant Reorganization Committee was organized, and relevant people in the city were hired as members of the committee, in order to gather the wisdom and efforts of the people and maintain it together, and to repair the internal machines to increase power. On the other hand, a new plant was planned to be built. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was allocated a complete set of 500-kilowatt steam turbine generator and boiler accessories. This new machine was transported to Bengbu from Shanghai in mid-November last year and has been completely installed. It is scheduled to be powered on during the old Lunar New Year Festival.

<h3>The Female Traitor is Insatiable; She Remains in Jail After Serving Her Sentence</h3>
<p>[Report from our Suzhou, 7th] Cao Huijun, a female traitor from Wuxi, is a well-known socialite in Xiyi. She was initially sentenced to seven years for treason by the Suzhou High Court. Cao appealed and the sentence was changed to one year and three months upon review. Unexpectedly, the traitor still expressed dissatisfaction and appealed to the Supreme Court for review, which is still pending. However, now that the one year and three month sentence has expired, Cao submitted a petition to the Suzhou High Court requesting release. The criminal court brought Cao to the court on the 7th and informed her that the Supreme Court had not yet made a ruling, so although the sentence had expired, she could not be released according to law and was ordered to be returned to custody. Cao deeply regretted not knowing self-sufficiency after hearing the notice and returned to prison in frustration. This is truly a humorous incident in punishing traitors.</p>

<p>[United Press London, 6th] British High Commissioner for Palestine, Sir Alan Cunningham, today conferred with Prime Minister Attlee on stern measures to curb Jewish underground sabotage in the region. Well-informed sources say that once Cunningham returns to Palestine within a week or ten days, these new measures will be implemented.</p>
<p>[Reuters London, 6th] The British Cabinet is scheduled to meet on Thursday to decide on actions to be taken in Palestine. It is reported that the government's plan has two main goals: one is to take strong military measures against Jewish terrorists, and the other is to divide Palestine into two states, Arab and Jewish. Military measures include the implementation of martial law and the arrest of members and suspects of the Irgun and Stern Gang, two illegal terrorist groups.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 6th] British desert troops today departed from Egypt for Palestine, while British troops await cabinet approval to launch an offensive against Jewish extremists. Government officials say that if authorized by the cabinet, this offensive will be the largest in modern Palestinian history, and the Jewish underground forces can be wiped out in one fell swoop. Reinforcements are being sent to Palestine via road and rail, reinforcing the 100,000 British troops already stationed there. The Palestinian plan was formulated at a meeting last week, attended by British High Commissioner for Palestine Cunningham, Chief of the Imperial General Staff Montgomery, Prime Minister Attlee, Foreign Secretary Bevin, and Colonial Secretary Jones. There was unanimous agreement at repeated meetings on the need to restore order in Palestine. If Britain wants to eliminate Jewish extremists before the London Round Table Conference on the 21st of this month, it must act quickly.</p>
<h3>US Republican and Democratic Parties Express Willingness to Cooperate; All Parties Impressed with the President's Message</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, 6th] Regarding President Truman's message to the 80th Congress, Senator Vandenberg of the Republican Party commented that the wording of President Truman's message was moderate and gentle, and was unanimously approved by Republican members. His arguments on the relationship between the White House and Congress were also reasonable. However, after Republican members thoroughly studied the President's plan, they had to express disagreement with some of the recommendations on labor and financial issues. In essence, Republicans agree with Truman's request to grant private enterprises great freedom to develop the American economy, and his request that the national budget should be balanced. However, they are very cold to other financial proposals.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Regarding President Truman's speech to the new Congress, Republican House Leader Halleck commented: The Republican Party is also willing to cooperate with President Truman to achieve a fair resolution of American issues. I believe that the Republican and Democratic parties will be able to work together harmoniously in the House.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] The section on labor issues in President Truman's message was endorsed by William Green, President of the American Federation of Labor. It is said that the President's proposal to establish an arbitration committee and not to pass strike prohibition laws is commendable. The Executive Committee of the AFL will review this issue at a meeting at the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Republican Party Proposes Limiting Presidential Terms</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Republican Senator Ball introduced the first labor bill of the day to the Senate this afternoon, based on the amended Case Bill. The Case Bill had been passed by the previous Congress but was vetoed by Truman. It is reported that Ball is still drafting other legislation that would make work stoppages that affect entire industries illegal. In the House, several members have proposed legislative amendments to the US Constitution, one of which is a proposal by Judiciary Committee Chairman Weichel to limit the president's term to a maximum of two consecutive terms of four years each. The second, proposed by Republican Congressman Canfield, suggests changing the four-year election system for president and vice president to a six-year election, but without the possibility of reelection after a full term. The third, also proposed by Republican Congressman Lea, suggests extending the term of House members from two to four years. The above amendments must first be passed by the Senate and House of Representatives and then ratified by two-thirds of the forty-eight states before they can be implemented.</p>
<h3>Guam and the Mariana Islands Should Be Incorporated into US Territory</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 6th] Republican Congressman Grant today introduced a bill proposing that Guam be incorporated into the US mainland and that the formerly Japanese Mariana Islands Trust Territory be managed by the US Development Committee.

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] US Secretary of State Byrnes recently commented on the resignation request of Baruch, representative to the Atomic Energy Commission, and praised his brave and consistent spirit in proposing the control of atomic energy plan. Briefly, the acceptance of the plan to control atomic energy is due to Baruch's efforts.</p>
<h3>Moutet Returns Home Today to Report; The Future of the Vietnamese Situation Remains Chaotic; French-Vietnamese Armistice Negotiations at a Standstill</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 7th] French Overseas Minister Moutet has completed his inspection of Vietnam and is scheduled to fly back to Paris on the 8th to report to the government.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 6th] French Overseas Colonial Minister Moutet told the press here: "I believe that military action will still have to continue for some time. We certainly hope that the French-Vietnamese conflict can be stopped as soon as possible, but I do not know how much effort we can make in this regard. Although it is necessary for both parties to reach an agreement, I do not know how to reach an agreement or with whom to reach an agreement. I know that the Viet Minh leaders do not want to reach an agreement with the Zaiguo. It is also questionable whether President Ho Chi Minh is free to do so. As for President Ho Chi Minh's broadcast speech inviting me to meet with him, I think this is purely propaganda, because the Viet Minh could have contacted me when I was in Hanoi. I also do not know who we should negotiate with, because we are not necessarily required to negotiate with those who started the conflict." In short, I will report the situation I have personally witnessed to the French government.</p>
<h3>French Forces in Vietnam Use Paratroopers</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 7th] A French military communiqué here stated: French paratroopers landed on the north bank of the canal near Nam Dinh yesterday morning to assist in overcoming the city.

<p>Giant cannons mounted on tank-like vehicles can fire 240-pound bullets with a range of 27 miles (Special dispatch from the New York Times). Both sides still hope to reach a solution.</p>
<h3>To Protect the Safety of Overseas Chinese, China and Viet Minh Negotiations Yield No Results</h3>
<p>Both Sides Still Hope to Reach a Solution</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 6th] Negotiations between the Chinese Consul General in Hanoi and representatives of the Viet Minh on safeguarding the lives and property of Chinese people have broken down after four days of continuation, but both sides still hope to find a solution. According to French military authorities, although Viet Minh elements are hiding in the Chinese quarter, the French army has only blockaded it and has not attacked it.</p>

<h3>British-Indian Relations Not Optimistic; Indian Leaders Denounce Britain</h3>
<p>[Reuters New Delhi, 6th] After the All-India Congress Committee passed the British government's statement of December 6, Congress President Kripalani predicted that disputes would continue to occur between Britain and India. The British government's statement explained the provisions on provincial division in its plan for Indian independence. The so-called provincial division system divides the provinces of India into three categories, and each province has the right to choose which category to join. The Congress Committee's acceptance of this statement may give the Muslim League an opportunity to join the Constituent Assembly. Kripalani said that although Britain is a socialist country, it is still a stubborn imperialist, so it will still try every possible means to obstruct India's progress.</p>
<h3>Montgomery Arrives in Moscow; Hopes This Trip Can Establish British-Soviet Friendship</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 6th] British Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal Montgomery, arrived here from Berlin at 3:10 PM today and immediately told the press: "I have come to your country as a soldier, and I must first express my respect to the Red Army." Although it was snowing heavily when Montgomery arrived in Moscow, the welcomers were still very crowded, including Soviet Chief of the General Staff Vasilevsky, General Slavin representing Chief of Staff Donov of the Army, Lieutenant General Golikov, the leader of the Soviet military delegation to Britain in 1941, and the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union. Montgomery addressed the welcomers, saying that the Soviet military and people fought bravely during the war and suffered the greatest losses. I want to keep the British and Soviet armies in friendly contact, and I hope that this contact can create an atmosphere of mutual understanding and trust, so as to promote friendly relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. Montgomery is scheduled to visit the Soviet military academy tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Laski Discusses Impressions of His Visit to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Beijing, 6th] Former British Labour Party Chairman Laski, who returned from a visit to the Soviet Union, gave a speech here today, elaborating on his impressions of his visit to the Soviet Union. He said that there is obviously a desire for peace in the Soviet Union. During my time in the Soviet Union, I discovered three different trends in Moscow political circles: one advocates a compromise attitude towards the United States and Western European countries, and Stalin also agrees with this view. The second does not believe that the Soviet Union can compromise with the United States and Western European countries, and Molotov belongs to this faction. The third is led by Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mikoyan, who, although he does not believe that the Soviet Union can compromise with the United States and Western Europe, is prepared to cooperate with these countries. The first trend is currently the most dominant.</p>
<h3>Philippines Plans to Send More Diplomatic Representatives</h3>
<p>[United Press Manila, 7th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that the Philippines plans to establish legations in Bangkok, London, Nanjing, and Madrid, and consulates in Shanghai, Barcelona, and Sydney. The establishment of the Madrid legation will depend on the United Nations' actions against Franco's Spain. Before the Philippines became independent on July 4 last year, most of its dealings with countries other than the United States relied on the US State Department. The plan to establish a consulate in Xiamen has already been announced. Currently, the countries with delegations stationed in the Philippines are China, the United States, Britain, France, and Italy. There are ten countries with consulates in Manila, namely the United States, Australia, the Netherlands, Siam, Switzerland, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Panama, and Lebanon.</p>

<h3>Indonesian and Dutch Military and Political Leaders Fly to Sumatra to Mediate</h3>
<p>[United Press Batavia, 6th] Dutch Army Chief of Staff Major General Van Rythoven and Dr. Gani, a member of the East Indonesian Republic government, flew together to Sumatra today to mediate the conflict between the Dutch army and the East Indonesian army in Palembang. The two armies have been fighting fiercely there for three days and have now stopped. However, according to a Dutch military communiqué, the war in Bandung has started again, and the East Indonesian army is constantly sending reinforcements. In Java, the East Indonesian army is still shelling Semarang. Van Rythoven flew to Sumatra to mediate the war in Palembang, and was ambushed along the way. The two teams of troops there signed a ceasefire agreement on Sunday, pending negotiations between senior officials of both sides in Batavia tomorrow. Gani gave a speech tonight after inspecting Palembang, saying that today's situation is the most serious since the two governments signed a ceasefire agreement on October 15 last year. The Dutch army launched attacks on land, sea, and air with bombers, artillery, destroyers, and gunboats, and at least 200 East Indonesian troops were killed or wounded. Almost all the residents of the city have fled, and the refugee camp has been bombed by Dutch planes. Oilfield workers have gone on strike in sympathy. Half of the Palembang urban area has been destroyed, and one area of two-story houses has been destroyed into flat ground. The port suffered the most damage.</p>
<h3>Dutch Warships Shell Indonesian Ships</h3>

<h3>Nagano's Testament Defends Himself; Goto Falls Ill in Prison</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 7th] Japanese war criminal Nagano, the former Minister of the Navy, recently died of pneumonia. His will defends himself against the charges. Briefly, the Japanese navy's operations were only to fulfill its duties, and he himself was a pro-American and pacifist. In April 1941, the navy already knew that the war against China had failed, but the army and navy opposed each other and refused to withdraw from the mainland and abandon the alliance with Germany and Italy. The navy was forced to fight against Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 7th] Japanese war criminal Muto, the former Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, was transferred to the hospital today due to pneumonia.

<h3>Hollywood Slump</h3>
<p>[United Press Hollywood, 7th] Hollywood has begun to slump, and all film production companies are preparing to tighten their belts. MGM is leading the way in reducing the number of new films. Last year, it made a total of 41 new films, and this year it plans to make only 24. The number of stars with the highest salaries will also be reduced. The same is true for other production companies.</p>
<h3>Severe Drought in the Soviet Union; Ukraine Also Has a Poor Harvest</h3>
<p>[This newspaper Nanjing, 7th] According to a person who recently returned from the Soviet Union, there was a widespread drought in the Soviet Union last year. The average time without rain was half a year, so the disaster was extremely serious. The crop harvest was poor, and the severity will be greater than the disasters of "1917" and "1918." Now in the cold winter, there is still no solution to the food problem. The food distributed by the government to the people is decreasing every day. Even Ukraine, which has always been known as the granary of the Soviet Union, also suffered a poor harvest last year, so the food crisis in the Soviet Union is currently very large.</p>

<h3>Full text of President Truman's address at the joint session of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives</h3>
<p>[Washington, DC, American News Service, 5th] President Truman delivered his farewell address to the new Congress today. The speech, which was 6,000 words long, reviewed the current state of the United States. He stated that if the United States wants to fulfill its responsibilities to the world, "We should make the United States sound in all aspects of its economy, society, and politics." He continued, "If we uphold and strengthen our original ideals, if we share the joys and sufferings of the war-torn people of the world, then the beliefs of our people in democracy and freedom will be spread far and wide, and free people everywhere will join us in dedicating ourselves to this ideal."</p>
<p>In the sections discussing foreign affairs, atomic energy, world trade, and military policy, President Truman stated:</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Progress in achieving our domestic goals is closely related to our actions in foreign affairs. What I said about maintaining a sound and prosperous economy and improving the welfare of our people has great significance because the United States is in a position of world leadership. What we do and fail to do at home will not only affect ourselves but will also affect the millions of people in the world. If we are to fulfill our responsibilities to our people and to the people of other countries, we should make the United States an economically, socially, and politically sound nation. Only in this way can we help other countries achieve the elements of peace: political stability, economic progress, and social advancement.</p>
<p>Peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Finland, and Hungary have now been drafted. These treaties will be signed in Paris next month and then sent to the Senate for ratification. This government is not completely satisfied with these treaties. Although these treaties are not without flaws, I believe they represent the best agreement we could hope to achieve among the major wartime allies. Further disputes and delays would seriously jeopardize the political security of the countries concerned.</p>
<p>During the long years of discussing these treaties, we have made it clear to all countries that the United States will not agree to seek solutions at the cost of abandoning certain principles that we consider essential for lasting peace. Similarly, we have made it clear that we will not retreat into isolation. We will adopt the same policies in the upcoming Moscow talks on the German and Austrian peace treaties and in future conferences on the Japanese peace treaty.</p>
<p>The reason for the delay in concluding peace treaties is partly due to the difficulty of reaching agreement with the Soviet Union on the terms of the treaties. Regardless of any differences between the United States and the Soviet Union, such differences should not be allowed to obstruct the fact that the primary interests of both countries depend on the early establishment of peace, and only in a peaceful environment can the people of all countries return to the important work of production and reconstruction as free men and women. Our greatest concern should be to promote collective security, not to enhance individual security.</p>
<p>Policy toward the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Our policy toward the Soviet Union is based on the same principles that determine our policy toward all countries. We seek only to uphold the principles of international justice enshrined in the United Nations Charter.</p>
<p>We must now pursue peaceful solutions. The occupying powers should recognize Austria's independence and withdraw their troops. Germans and Japanese must not be left in doubt about their future. They must understand their borders, their resources, and the reparations they must pay. We do not want to manage their internal affairs, but we can ensure that these countries will not rearm.</p>
<p>International Relief</p>
<p>The United States has fulfilled a proud responsibility in caring for the people impoverished by the war and assisting countries in restoring their national economies. Since the end of the war, we have shipped more supplies to the hungry people of the world than all other countries combined.</p>
<p>However, I do not feel that the United States has fulfilled its responsibility regarding the acceptance of refugees. Since May 1946, only about 5,000 refugees have entered this country. In fact, various administrative agencies are now doing their best to provide relief within the limits of the law and quotas. Congress needs to take action with new legislation to contribute to this righteous cause. I strongly urge Congress to pay attention to this global problem and find a way for us to fulfill our responsibility to these many homeless refugees.</p>
<p>International Trade</p>
<p>World economic cooperation is a fundamental element of world political cooperation. We have made a good start on economic cooperation through the International Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Export-Import Bank. We must now take other steps to rebuild world trade, and we should continue our efforts to ensure that the international trade system is not restricted by various obstacles. The United States has led the effort to place atomic energy under effective international control. We do not want a monopoly for ourselves or any group of countries. We seek only to have sufficient guarantees that no country can use this power (atomic energy) for military purposes. If governments do not agree on a method of international control of atomic energy, then the shadow of fear will obscure the bright future of the peaceful uses of atomic energy.</p>
<p>Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the commission established under this law has full jurisdiction over our domestic atomic energy enterprises. The commission's plans will, of course, be carried out in close cooperation with military agencies in accordance with the wishes of Congress, but I sincerely hope that the military importance of atomic energy will gradually diminish. We expect the commission to develop atomic energy for industrial, scientific, and medical research. Our hopes are placed on the effective development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy: this new power can ultimately become the well-being of all countries.</p>
<p>Military Policy</p>
<p>In 1946, the Army and Navy completed the demobilization of their wartime forces. They are now maintaining the forces necessary for our national defense and to fulfill our international obligations.</p>
<p>In the world we live in today, the strength of peace-loving nations remains the greatest deterrent to aggression. When nations with major responsibilities neglect to maintain the means to fulfill their responsibilities, the stability of the world is undermined.</p>
<p>In this era, unpredictable attacks can come with unprecedented speed. We want to maintain strength sufficient to defeat any such attack and thereby prevent it. As we gradually move toward a more rational world order, the need for large armies will also decrease. However, the stabilizing force of American military strength should not be weakened until our hopes are fully realized. When a collective security system under the United Nations has been established, we will be willing to join in collective disarmament. However, unless such a system has been realized, we should never again allow our strength to be weakened, lest we invite attack.</p>
<p>To this end, we must have well-equipped and well-trained armed forces, and we should be able to quickly mobilize our manpower and resources as needed for national defense.</p>
<p>By July 1, 1947, the Army will be reduced to a total of 1.07 million officers and enlisted personnel. Half of them will be tasked with occupation duties, and the majority of the remainder will be stationed at home to support the overseas occupation forces.</p>
<p>The Navy is currently supporting the occupation forces in Europe and the Far East. Its main mission—to support our national interests when necessary—remains unchanged. During the 1948 fiscal year, the Navy (including the Marine Corps) will have 571,000 officers and enlisted personnel.</p>
<p>Even at this reduced level, we face many serious difficulties in maintaining our military. The occupation forces are barely sufficient to fulfill the duties required by our foreign policy. Our domestic forces have been reduced to the point where they cannot be reduced further. We would very much like the Army and Navy to be composed entirely of long-term volunteer soldiers, but although our military has been reduced, it is still difficult for voluntary enlistments to meet the Army's minimum requirements.</p>
<p>The Department of the Army has advised me that it is still difficult to predict whether the strength of an all-volunteer army can be maintained at the current level. This situation will become clear in a few weeks, when the results of the volunteer recruitment campaign will be announced. The Department of the Army will make recommendations regarding the need to extend the Selective Service Act so that Congress can take action before the current regulations expire on March 31. Maintaining the strength needed for our national security is the responsibility of Congress.</p>
<p>Developing a trained citizen reserve force is also essential for our national security. The best way to accomplish this task is through universal training. I have appointed a Universal Training Advisory Committee to study various plans to develop a training program, and I hope that the committee's recommendations will assist Congress and me in making decisions on this issue. The cost of this military construction is substantial. There is now a definite path along which we can reduce our expenses while ensuring our national security, and that is to establish a single Department of Defense. In the near future, I will exchange views with Congress on the issue of establishing a single Department of Defense.</p>
<p>National security includes not only the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Its scope is much broader. National security will depend on a sound economy of prices and wages, on prosperous agriculture, on satisfied and highly productive workers, on competitive private investment, on sustained industrial harmony and production, on the freedoms of the people and the liberties of the person—on everything that shapes the moral and spiritual strength of the people.</p>
<p>However, in addition to achieving national security, we have a higher and more important responsibility. Our goal is the collective security of all mankind. If we can work in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect, we will be able to fulfill this sacred obligation.</p>
<p>The spirit of the American people can determine the course of world history. If we uphold and strengthen the ideals we hold, if we share our blessings with the war-torn people of the world, then our citizens' beliefs in freedom and democracy will spread throughout the globe, and free people everywhere will work with us for these ideals.</p>
<p>Let us work together on this task with will and patience. May God strengthen our faith. May she grant us the wisdom to lead the nations of the world on the path to lasting peace.</p>
<p>Domestic Issues</p>
<p>Today I would also like to report to you on the domestic situation and, in accordance with the words of the Constitution, propose the measures I consider necessary and urgent.</p>
<p>I also come to welcome you into office and discuss with you how we should fulfill our obligations to the American people for the next two years.</p>
<p>The power to shape our country's future lies in your hands and in mine.</p>
<p>If we can find the right way to deal with every problem this year and next, if we have the courage and determination to take that path regardless of all difficulties, then we will achieve unprecedented happiness for our people in history. If we continue to cooperate with the nations of the world with enthusiasm, patience, and intelligence, then, as long as our neighbors also have the will to peace, we will be able to complete a world with lasting peace.</p>
<p>But if we are to achieve these goals, then the Congress and the President must cooperate with each other for the next two years. It is not an unusual thing in our history for the majority party in Congress and the party to which the President belongs to be in opposing positions. I am the twentieth President of the United States in my term, and my party holds a minority in both houses of Congress.</p>
<p>I am well aware that Congress and the President may have honest differences of opinion on some issues. However, such differences did not cause significant disagreements in the conduct of the war, and partisan differences did not cause serious disagreements in international relations during and after the war.</p>
<p>We may have disagreed on some domestic issues. This in itself is not a cause for concern, as it is natural in our system of government. But there are several types of disagreements, and people who disagree can still cooperate sincerely for the common good. If we disregard partisan interests and do not resolve disagreements in this spirit, then we will jeopardize the security of the country and destroy our chances for progress.</p>
<p>Domestic Economy</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, 1947, our country's economic situation is extremely optimistic. Almost everyone has a job. Our national production of goods and services is 50 percent higher than in any year before the wartime emergency. The national income in 1946 was higher than at any other time. Our food production is greater than ever before. In the past five years, we have expanded production equipment in every area. The standard of living in the United States is now higher than ever before, and when the housing shortage can be overcome, the standard of living will be even higher.</p>
<p>In the past few months, we have rapidly abolished the emergency controls imposed by the federal government during the war. The remaining controls will only be retained to protect the public interest. Private enterprises must have the maximum degree of freedom to continue to expand our economy.</p>
<p>In my proclamation of December 31, 1946, I declared the war to be over. As a result, some temporary legislation and some powers were automatically terminated.</p>
<p>Two sets of temporary laws still exist: the first set consists of laws ordered by Congress to remain in effect during the "emergency" period, and the second set consists of laws that continue until the "end of the war."</p>
<p>I will recommend to Congress that it repeal certain statutes that continue during the "emergency period." At the same time, I will recommend that other statutes in this category be extended until the state of war is ended by treaty or legislative action. Regarding those statutes that continue, I strongly urge Congress to quickly consider each statute individually and, where appropriate, repeal such emergency legislation.</p>
<p>Now that almost all wartime controls have been abolished, the operation of our industrial system depends largely on the decisions of merchants, farmers, and workers. These decisions must be made with a genuine concern for the public welfare. The happiness of merchants, farmers, and workers depends on the economic welfare of the people who buy their goods.</p>
<p>An important source of economic danger at present is the possibility of high prices, which would make it impossible for the consuming public to buy large quantities of the goods and services produced in 1947.</p>
<p>We all know that the recent increase in prices has offset much of the value of the recent wage increases for our workers. Farmers have found that most of the increase in their income has been absorbed by the increase in prices. Some people in our country still have an increase in their income that exceeds the increase in prices, but most people have not received such a large increase. Those who live on fixed incomes, such as retired people who live on pensions and staff whose income is more flexible, such as teachers or other public servants, have been in difficulty.</p>
<p>In an effort to create a sound and balanced price organization, every group among our people has its own responsibilities. Industry must not only restrain price increases, but also reduce prices in favorable circumstances. Labor must avoid demanding unreasonable wage increases so as not to stimulate price increases. The government must do its best to encourage large-scale production, because with large-scale production, there can be good salaries, low prices, and reasonable profits.</p>
<p>In a few days, the President will submit to Congress an economic report and a budget message. These messages will contain many suggestions. Today I will outline five major economic policies that I believe the government should adopt in 1947. The purpose of these policies is to meet our current needs and at the same time provide for the long-term welfare of our free enterprise system:</p>
<p>First, promote harmony between labor and management. Second, restrict monopolies and unfair regulations; assist small businesses, promote free competition in private investment. Third, continue the aggressive program of domestic construction. Fourth, balance the budget for the next fiscal year and achieve a substantial surplus to reduce the public debt. Fifth, in post-war agriculture, ensure that farmers receive fair levels of remuneration. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>

<h3>City Council Lively Proceedings Third Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The City Council continued its second meeting of the second general assembly at Zhengshi Middle School at 2:20 p.m. yesterday. Councilors questioned the police, health, social welfare, and education bureaus. During the meeting, the case of garbage truck drivers of the Health Bureau using public vehicles for private gain sparked a lively discussion. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m. All written and oral inquiries were submitted in writing to the responsible officials for investigation and response. In addition, due to time constraints, the bureau chiefs of the four bureaus were unable to answer all inquiries orally yesterday, and the unanswered inquiries will be continued at the third meeting this afternoon. During today's general assembly, the council will also question the finance, land administration, public utilities, and engineering bureaus.</p>
<p>In addition, the Xindu Broadcasting Station (call sign XLST, frequency 1160), sponsored by the City Council, will broadcast the entire news of the general assembly daily during the meeting.</p>

<h3>The Highest Point of the General Assembly A Major Disturbance Garbage Trucks Engaging in Private Business Transporting Vegetables and Yellow Croaker The Health Bureau Chief's Unsatisfactory Response Sparks a Wave of Criticism Throughout the Venue</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Near the end of yesterday's general assembly, a sudden storm arose over the Health Bureau's garbage trucks engaging in private business, instantly making the atmosphere at the venue tense. Some councilors were impatient to speak, and the sound from the loudspeakers was truly earth-shattering.</p>
<p>The reason for the councilors' extensive discussion was that Wang Naixu raised an inquiry with the Health Bureau: "There is so much garbage piled up in the city, and the Health Bureau is not doing its best to clear it away. Instead, every morning, garbage trucks are used to load vegetables between Dapu Bridge and the fish market, transporting vegetables and yellow croaker for vendors to do business. The budget for the purchase of equipment for cleaning garbage and excrement is 120 million yuan. Using the citizens' hard-earned money to do business is truly heartbreaking." There were also photos to prove it.</p>
<p>Based on this, Xu Yongzuo, Jiang Pingfan, and 23 other councilors proposed an emergency motion: "Regarding the case of the Health Bureau's garbage trucks engaging in private business for personal gain, please have the general assembly appoint representatives to form an investigation team to thoroughly investigate." Councilor Jiang added that the Health Bureau's illegal profits could reach more than 30 million yuan per month. At the same time, using such dirty vehicles to transport vegetables is detrimental to hygiene. Please organize an investigation team and ask Director Zhang to report truthfully.</p>
<p>Then everyone discussed the matter, some supported organizing an investigation team, some suggested that Director Zhang investigate and report to the general assembly within two days, and some advocated handing it over to the Health Committee for review. The result was to ask Director Zhang to first give an explanation. Zhang Wei under attack from all sides (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Zhang Wei Takes the Stage to Speak Calling it Service in Spare Time</h3>
<p>Director Zhang calmly stepped onto the podium and said: "Speaker, gentlemen, we have already investigated a few times about garbage trucks bringing back vegetables and yellow croaker after work, and we have punished some drivers. I do not deny this fact. This kind of thing also existed in the concession era. But the drivers' salaries are meager, only 120,000 yuan per month. Many drivers have resigned or been dismissed. Some have worked for more than ten years, and we always want to treat them kindly. New drivers are not familiar with the work and often overturn when dumping garbage. In order to find a way out for the drivers and turn illegal behavior into legal behavior, we give them two or three hours of 'service in spare time' after they finish their work, lend them the trucks, use their own gasoline, and find some subsidies. But I guarantee that no one in the bureau has colluded with them. I have reported this matter to the mayor at municipal meetings several times. At the same time, I absolutely welcome the City Council to send representatives to investigate, but the drivers are so poor, please find a way to help them solve their difficulties." The mayor also followed up by stating and proving for Director Zhang that he had indeed reported it several times, but he really could not think of a reasonable solution. He had consulted Councilor Zhou Xiangsheng, but because he was too busy with public affairs, there was no result. I can prove that Director Zhang himself has absolutely no collusion, but this trend is indeed not appropriate.</p>
<h3>Garbage Trucks Carrying Vegetables Too Unhygienic</h3>
<p>Obviously, the councilors did not find the director's report satisfactory. Shao Yongsheng was also very sympathetic to the drivers' meager salaries, but he did not agree that the City Council should find a way to solve the difficulties. This should be the responsibility of the bureau. On the other hand, since the director has admitted that this happened and explained the situation, it seems unnecessary to organize an investigation team.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongyuan thought of a practical and serious problem, "Garbage trucks are used to transport vegetables, and we eat them every day, isn't that too unhygienic, too dangerous?" Xu Yongzuo strongly disagreed with the director's attitude of sympathizing with his subordinates, he said: The director seems to be openly allowing his subordinates to be "corrupt," then other civil servants can also be "corrupt" because their salaries are meager. The trend of "corruption" must not be rectified. Because there is no way to solve the problem, and they can be "corrupt," can they still be worthy of being Chinese citizens!</p>
<h3>Since Garbage Trucks Can Do Business in Spare Time Why Doesn't the Municipal Government Turn the Place into a Dance Floor at Night? Jiang Hao Raises Questions Lu Shidao Demands a Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>One wrong word from Director Zhang caused a major disaster, and the councilors attacked him in groups. Lu Shidao said angrily: "Local officials allow their subordinates to be 'corrupt.' Not only is Director Zhang responsible, but the mayor should also be responsible. How is this money from corruption used? Does the director get a share? Does the mayor get a share? This matter must be thoroughly investigated. Jiang Hao also expressed suspicion, he asked: "If public vehicles are used for business, then can the municipal government's houses be lent to the public at night to be used as dance floors or to sell vegetables? The municipal government often says that the concession era also had this, and foreign countries also have this. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they still say this kind of thing. This phenomenon really shouldn't exist. Otherwise, everything is good in foreign countries, why not give away the previous concessions again?"</p>
<h3>Zhang Wei Takes the Stage Again Explaining the Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>At this time, Speaker Pan spoke and announced the end of the discussion, asking Director Zhang to provide further explanation. Director Zhang quickly stated, "I didn't explain clearly just now, which caused a misunderstanding. I didn't say that this kind of thing should be done. The drivers who were discovered have been fired. In desperation, I made the behavior in the dark done in broad daylight to make it legal. But this kind of behavior is indeed illegal. I believe that I have been law-abiding throughout my life, but it is difficult to make the three or four thousand cleaners and garbage collectors sound, even though I have not managed them fully. We have organized a 'Cleaning and Sanitation Management Committee' as an advisory body to seek solutions."</p>
<p>Four councilors: Expressions when speaking: Lu Huimin Bottom: Tong Xingbai Right: Tao Baichuan Left: Feng Youzhen</p>
<h3>Final Vote on Submission to Committee Review</h3>
<p>Among the senators, some also felt that this matter should not be taken so seriously. Tao Baichuan proposed that it be handed over to the Health Committee for review before further action. The speaker also announced the same result, clarifying that review did not mean the matter would be dropped. However, Wang Naixu insisted on investigating how many such garbage trucks there were, how much income was embezzled, and how the distribution was handled.</p>
<p>Finally, when it became unavoidable to put it to a vote, the result was that 45 out of 118 people seconded the motion to submit it to the Health Committee for review. However, Lu Shidao insisted on forming an investigation team, while only ten votes supported submitting it to the committee for review. In the end, it was decided to submit it to the Health Committee for review, and the original proposer could also attend. The meeting time was repeatedly postponed, and at six o'clock, a heated scene finally came to an end.</p>
<h3>Municipal School Teachers Petition, Requesting Increased Salaries; General Assembly Discusses and Decides to Submit to Education Committee for Review</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The Municipal Elementary School Principals' Association and the Municipal School Teachers and Staff Association jointly petitioned the General Assembly yesterday. The Education Committee conveners, Tong Xingbai, Ju Feicheng, and Xu Zerang, received them, and Mr. Tong reported to the General Assembly that the petitioners' main point was that their salaries were too low to maintain a living, and they requested an increase. The main method proposed was to collect a "Respect-the-Teacher Fund" from students, similar to a teacher welfare fund. Due to the significant implications, they did not have the authority to respond and could only await the General Assembly's final decision. After discussion, it was decided to submit it to the Education Committee for review.</p>
<h3>Market Vendors Also Come to Petition</h3>
<p>Following the petition to the General Assembly by outdoor vegetable vendors from the 11th District the day before, yesterday, several hundred indoor vegetable vendors from the same district also arrived at the General Assembly to petition, holding red and green paper flags. They claimed that the outdoor vegetable vendors setting up stalls at the entrances and exits were obstructing the business of the indoor vegetable vendors, and they requested the Senate to uphold justice and stop it. Senator Tang Shichang received them and advised both sides to first discuss a proper solution for harmonious coexistence. Regarding the opposition from the cultural and artistic circles, I believe everyone is already aware. Now, friends in the cultural field have asked me to convey that art is also a part of culture. In Shanghai, which claims to be the national cultural center, it is unacceptable to not allow the establishment of even a single art school. Currently, general national schools lack labor and art teachers, and art teachers can provide assistance in this regard. I have several questions for the Education Bureau: (1) How much money was actually saved by abolishing an art normal school? (2) What fraction of the total education budget did the total expenditure for art teachers account for last year? (3) Will the abolition be beneficial or detrimental to national education? This is not a question of censure, but rather a request for a response.</p>
<h3>Next Semester Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of tuition fees for the next semester, Huang Bingquan asked: (1) The last General Assembly resolved to impose restrictions because private school fees were too high. Now that the cost of living has increased, tuition fees will also increase. Does the Education Bureau already have regulations for tuition fees for the next semester? (2) The semester is coming to an end, and schools are charging students' parents a "retention fee," ranging from 20,000 to 40,000 [currency unit] for elementary schools. What is this money used for? Has the Education Bureau approved or agreed to this beforehand? Female Senator Lu Huiming also questioned whether there were already regulations for tuition fees for municipal and private schools for the next semester. Furthermore, Zhu Wenqi asked: The Ministry of Education ordered private schools to register. What proportion of private schools completed registration during the initial one-quarter period, and how many of the remaining three-quarters have completed the registration procedures to date? Gong Xia stated: (1) There are few schools in suburban areas, and many children are out of school. Although this was included in this year's budget, is it still possible to increase it? (2) What is the performance of adult education's public night schools? If they are not performing well, it would be better to abolish them and establish more national schools. Tao Guangchuan stated: After the salaries of municipal school teachers and staff were adjusted in December, they still felt unable to make ends meet. Today, education is touted as the top priority, and teachers have great responsibilities, but because their lives are unstable, they are switching careers, which has a significant impact. Therefore, it is hoped that salaries will be substantially increased and that teachers' salaries should not be restricted by comparison to civil servants. Wang Wei yin stated: Radio education is a major issue for social education and should be given more attention. The Senate previously resolved that education funding should not be less than 20 percent of the budget. The original budget was 6.2 billion [currency unit], but the Education Bureau's report shows that only 1.8 billion [currency unit] has been used. It is hoped that more will be used to promote education.</p>

<h3>Dissatisfaction with Education, Questions Arise in Succession; Dismissal of Art Normal School Seen as Bordering on Prejudice</h3>
<p>There were also quite a few questions about the Education Bureau. Regarding the dismissal of the Municipal Art Normal School, there were two opposing opinions: Shen Ding stated: (1) The last General Assembly passed a resolution requesting the municipal government to order the Education Bureau to adjust its structure and save expenses. Yesterday, when the General Assembly opened, students from the Municipal Art Normal School braved the wind and rain to distribute leaflets in front of the gate to petition. I felt uneasy when I saw this. However, after carefully studying the matter, I felt that the Education Bureau should be held responsible for this. The reasons are as follows: (1) Dismissing the Municipal Art Normal School and merging it into the Xinlu Normal School would still allow art students to study, and there would be no increase in expenses. This is something easy to do, so why did the Education Bureau sit idly by and not do it? (2) In the Education Bureau's budget for the second half of 1946, it stated that the Art Normal School would be maintained until the end of the year. However, in the bureau's budget for this year, the Art Normal School's expenses are still included, which shows a self-contradiction and a lack of sincerity. (3) In the Art Normal School, there are only two art classes, but there are three ordinary junior high school classes. Why add affiliated classes outside of the Art Normal School? This clearly violates the Ministry of Education's regulations. The Education Bureau is clearly acting out of spite and obstructing things. Since the last General Assembly resolved to dismiss it, an advertisement has appeared in the newspaper ridiculing me for not understanding education and praising the Education Bureau. This is truly a miracle in the education sector in recent years. When I raised this case last time, I had no prejudice or intention to deliberately make things difficult.</p>
<h3>Request to Cancel Electricity Restrictions, Decision to First Stop Wire-Cutting Measures</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, senators offered opinions to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, regarding the issue of electricity restrictions. Senator Wang Zhuyi told the director to request the cancellation of electricity restrictions from February 1 and to abolish the wire-cutting method. Senator Zhu Fuzhu hoped that the bureau would temporarily restrict electric heating but not restrict electric lighting, as the New Year was approaching. For city households, the wire-cutting method has been decided to be canceled, and all relevant personnel were notified to stop wire-cutting the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Submits Two More Proposals</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Mayor Wu continued to submit two proposals to the Municipal Senate yesterday, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To restore all city streetlights to their pre-war state to meet the needs of the citizens and to include it in the budget. Request for approval. (2) As the city's traffic congestion situation is becoming increasingly serious and must be resolved, in addition to the engineering department submitting a separate proposal for discussion, the recently proposed measures regarding vehicles and vendors are submitted for public decision.</p>
<h3>Tao Baichuan Reports on Participation in Constitution-Making Process</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Municipal Senator and National Assembly Representative Tao Baichuan reported to the General Assembly on his participation in the constitution-making process yesterday before the second meeting began. He briefly stated that the following matters within the constitution were particularly related to the rights of Shanghai citizens: (A) The representation of Shanghai citizens in the new political system: Shanghai can elect eight representatives to participate in the National Assembly. Colleagues and others repeatedly requested amendments to make it proportional to the population, but the results were not passed. For legislators, it is stipulated that eighteen cities and provinces are proportional to the population, with one representative elected for every million people over three million, so this city can elect six committee members. As for the number of seats for supervisory committee members, municipalities directly under the central government produce two or three. Colleagues and others have also repeatedly requested an increase, but it was not accepted by the review committee. (B) The autonomy rights of Shanghai citizens at the local level: The autonomy rights of municipalities directly under the central government have not been guaranteed by the constitution. Mr. Tao will propose to the Municipal Senate to petition the central government to guarantee citizens' autonomy rights on this point.</p>
<h3>Teachers' Respect Fund Procedures Not Cleared</h3>
<p>(1) It is said that more than 10 million [currency unit] in procedures for the Teachers' Respect Fund have not yet been cleared. Who is currently in charge of this fund? Which bank is it deposited in? How are the interest proceeds handled? (3) Regarding the issue of food expenses for normal school students, according to my knowledge, there are only over 700 normal school students in this city, but the Education Bureau's budget lists 1,000 people. And the usual food expenses for schools are 30,000 to 40,000 [currency unit] per person per month. Why is the budget as high as 50,000 to 70,000 [currency unit]? Is it also because it includes seat donations? Those in attendance laughed loudly upon hearing this. Zhao Yangxiong continued to speak about the issue of abolishing art teachers, stating: After the case was resolved last time,</p>
<h3>Most of the Previous Resolutions Have Not Been Implemented</h3>
<p>Ma Junshuo questioned how various bureaus had implemented the resolutions of the First General Assembly, stating: The majority of the resolutions have not been implemented to date. According to the Secretariat's report, out of 175 cases submitted, 64 have been answered, and 111 have not. And whether those that have been answered have been implemented is still a question, and those that have not been answered are even more baffling. Such a lack of explanation will greatly disappoint the five million citizens.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu immediately responded to the quiet implementation of the resolutions, stating: I feel very fearful. The facts are slightly different from what is written. The 64 cases refer to those that have already reached a conclusion, and the others are about to reach a conclusion or are still in progress. I sincerely express my determination to faithfully implement all resolutions and will never shirk responsibility.</p>
<h3>Do More Positive Work in Social and Industrial/Commercial Administration</h3>
<p>There were relatively few questions for the Social Affairs Bureau. Lu Yinchu asked: Under the pressure of high-interest loans, how many public pawnshops have been established to benefit ordinary citizens, and what are the results? Xu Yongzuo stated: It is hoped that more positive guidance, improvement, and management work can be done in the areas of social, industrial, and commercial administration, and less negative work of prohibition. Zhu Wende stated: (1) This year's cotton harvest in the suburbs has been abundant, but because manufacturers are using American cotton, prices have not only not risen but have fallen instead, and farmers are on the verge of bankruptcy. Does the Social Affairs Bureau have any relief measures? (2) According to the Social Affairs Bureau's report, many cooperatives have been established, but their performance is not being managed. It is said that when allocating goods to manufacturers, they often refuse or deliberately make things difficult. (3) Regarding the issue of temple properties at the Jing'an Temple a few days ago, mutual attacks were seen in the newspapers again. Does the Social Affairs Bureau supervise temples? Yu Chuanding stated: The Social Affairs Bureau's registration of businesses is not divided by region, will this lead to duplication?</p>
<h3>Seriously Discuss the Budget, Reschedule the Agenda</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Senator Xu Yongzuo and others believe that reviewing the municipal government's budget for 1947 is the most important work of the General Assembly and must be carefully studied and analyzed before a decision can be made. He believes that the last review of the budget was not serious enough, so he proposed a temporary motion to change the agenda, adding two more subcommittee review meetings and one General Assembly review meeting, specifically for discussing the budget. After it was passed, it was submitted to the Secretariat to schedule the agenda.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu also spoke to reporters about the budget issue yesterday, reiterating that the municipal government had to increase personnel for construction and municipal administration, and the budget had been reduced as much as possible. However, he admitted: "In reality, because the market is sluggish, citizens feel that the burden is too heavy; otherwise, they would definitely feel that the budget is not too large."</p>
<h3>Jiangwan Stadium Destroyed by Explosion; Request Compensation for Losses; Request the Municipal Government to Negotiate with the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Twenty-nine senators, including Xu Zerang, stated that the Jiangwan Municipal Stadium was large in scale and magnificent in construction, and was one of the best in the country. It was not damaged during the enemy occupation period, but after the victory, the municipal government did not take it over, and it was occupied by the Ministry of National Defense. This time, it was severely damaged due to a munitions depot explosion. Yesterday, they jointly submitted an emergency motion to the General Assembly, requesting the municipal government to negotiate with the Ministry of National Defense to allocate funds to compensate for the losses, so as to maintain public property and benefit education. The General Assembly passed the motion with a majority of 86 votes and submitted it to the municipal government for handling.</p>
<h3>Raising the Issue of Vendors, Unanimously Blaming the Police Bureau; Arbitrary Confiscation of Goods; For Public Use? For Private Use?</h3>
<p>There were many questions about the Police Bureau, involving vendor incidents, with much criticism. Zhang Zhihan stated: In the last General Assembly, I asked how many street vendors there were and how many goods the Police Bureau had confiscated. At that time, Director Guan replied that the goal was not to confiscate. But to this day, police are still seen arbitrarily confiscating goods and driving away with them. This must not be the intention of the police authorities. I personally witnessed a police officer getting out of a jeep at the entrance of a lane on Fourth Road, taking two pieces of leather from a leather craftsman's carrying pole. The leather craftsman asked if he could take one piece less, but the police officer ignored him, got in the car, and drove away. The jeep was full of oranges and American goods, etc. In the end, do they go to public use, or to private use? Nowadays, if some police officers want to eat oranges, they go to a vendor and take them as they please, even taking extras home. Lu Yinchu continued to question the Police Bureau, asking why the fines for violations of regulations should be announced monthly. What was the reason for not announcing them in the past? He also stated that whenever an emergency occurs in this city, Mayor Wu personally goes to the scene to inspect, which is admirable. But Director Xuan cannot be seen, is it because he is busy with public affairs, or with private affairs? Xu Yongzuo stated: When the vendor incident occurred, my office was a stone's throw away from the Huangpu Sub-bureau, and I heard and saw that the authorities were too hasty at the beginning, otherwise, the matter would not have escalated. Although the matter has passed, the police authorities should bear full responsibility. One cannot reduce the livelihood of small vendors for the sake of cleaning up the city's appearance. In connection with this, I think of the issue of banning rickshaws. If they are banned, their livelihood will be lost. If it is said that rickshaws are inhumane, then the sedan chair carriers in the interior and the porters on the docks are even more inhumane, should they also be banned? I hope the municipal authorities will proceed carefully.</p>
<p>Shao Yongsheng stated: Beautifying the city's appearance is not possible at the moment. Urban decoration work can only be done after the people's general life is stable. The Police Bureau's budget for this year has increased by more than 6,000 police officers. I think we can use volunteer police instead to reduce the budget. However, the quality of volunteer police should be improved. Lu Huiming stated: The Police Bureau's handling of the vendor incident was excessive and should be handled carefully in the future. Qu Yue stated: It is a fact that police salaries are low. Leaders should consider whether they are enough to maintain a minimum standard of living and find ways to provide relief or carry out welfare projects, otherwise, there will be many abuses. And the vendor incident caused a great uproar. At the time, why did the Police Bureau detain so many vendors? Was there anything that was not done well enough? Wang Weiyin stated: The last General Assembly resolved to request the municipal government to include 1 billion [currency unit] in the budget for supplementing fire-fighting equipment. And request the municipal government to consult with the Relief Administration to allocate 50 motorized vehicles to assist in fire-fighting. The municipal government's report did not mention it, but in reality, the security police expenditure for the first half of the year has exceeded the budget. Why was it not used when it should have been, and more was used for other things instead? Zhu Wenqi stated: According to the Police Bureau's budget, it plans to take back the fire-fighting associations in Nanshi and Zhabei to be run by the public sector. In fact, private management is not necessarily bad. Ding Shanming and Lu Yinchu stated: The last General Assembly resolved to abolish the mounted patrol unit. This time, the Police Bureau submitted a request for reconsideration. What is the reason? Senator Ding also stated: The Police Bureau once said that the pressure on the mounted patrol unit was great. Recently, there have been robberies in the Beixinjing area every night. Can the mounted patrol unit go to the area to patrol and suppress them? Xie Dahuang stated: (1) The mayor reported that 100 percent of kidnapping cases in the past three months have been solved. Recently, in the suburbs, due to the work of suppressing bandits, families are being robbed everywhere, and people are being openly arrested. (2) Registered and examined opium addicts are all complaining that they are living like prisoners. It is hoped that attention will be paid to improving the situation. Zhang Zhihan stated: Many "water rats" have already been arrested by the police. According to reports, some police officers are also colluding in large-scale theft cases. Chen Kai stated: The organization of self-defense forces is for the purpose of protecting oneself, not for causing trouble. Why is the Police Bureau not allowing them to organize? Yu Chuanding stated: The Police Bureau's household registration survey work cost a total of 1.4 billion [currency unit]. Is there a duplication with the work of the Civil Affairs Bureau? The Police Bureau's museum duplicates the one run by the Education Bureau, and it seems that they can be merged to save expenses. And the Police Hospital's expenses last year totaled over 120 million [currency unit]. There is one hospital for the city's 20,000 police officers, but only eight municipal hospitals for millions of citizens. Therefore, the Police Hospital should be changed to a municipal hospital. Female Senator Tong Daoyuan stated: The police are cracking down on prostitution and plan to establish a women's relief agency with the Social Affairs Bureau, with the aim of establishing it in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Material Supply Situation; External Complaints and Criticisms; Decision to Request the Director of the Material Supply Bureau to Attend and Report</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Twenty-one senators, including Feng Youzhen, submitted an emergency motion yesterday: "Please send a letter to the Director of the Material Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan, requesting him to attend the General Assembly and report on the material supply situation." The reason for this is: The Executive Yuan established the Material Supply Bureau in Shanghai, and the name implies that its main task is to supply materials to relieve people's needs, not to engage in business for profit. This is clear. However, since the bureau was established, there have been external complaints and criticisms about the supply of materials, especially the supply of jeeps and military blankets, and many have been dissatisfied. Some say that the prices charged by the bureau for the supplies are too high, which undermines the true meaning of supply. Others say that the bureau's selection of recipients for the supplies depends entirely on their power, status, and personal connections with people in the bureau. Some even say that they use the supply of materials for black market trading to profit from it. We dare not draw conclusions about the truth, but as this council represents the interests of the city's citizens, we have a sacred mission to rectify discipline and establish a clean government. It is necessary to have a clear understanding of the material supply situation of the Material Supply Bureau, such as: (1) the sources and quantities of various materials and their original selling prices, (2) the standards and methods for allocating materials, (3) the recipients of the allocations and their lists, (4) whether there is black market trading to profit from it, etc. Therefore, we submit an emergency motion to send a letter to the Director of the Material Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan, requesting him to attend this council and report in detail.</p>
<h3>Accompanying Personnel and Carrying Data; Zhang Wei Suffers Siege</h3>
<p>Yesterday's agenda was to question the heads of the Police, Social Affairs, Health, and Education Bureaus. Each bureau director brought a large number of accompanying personnel, such as secretaries and section chiefs, and carried a large amount of data to the scene, waiting to be "questioned." The Education Bureau even hung charts on the four walls of the meeting place. Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau suffered a "siege." Because of time constraints, the other three bureaus were able to postpone answering the questions until today. A certain senator said: "It's too cheap for them to have so much preparation." Director Gu Chunfan of the Finance Bureau, Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Director Zhu Ping of the Land Bureau all attended the meeting as observers. Director Zhao held a pipe in his hand, looking very leisurely.</p>
<p>Senator Zhang Zhihan said that if the common people are not good, there is a police management system. Now that the police are not good, there should be a system for managing the police.</p>
<p>Xu Yongzuo opened fire on the military service issue, advocating that Shanghai should temporarily postpone conscription. His words were激烈, and in the middle of his speech, there was continuous hissing from the right front seats.</p>
<p>Xu said that Shanghai soldiers are either young masters or old masters, and they may die during training.</p>
<p>During the break, Mayor Wu left his seat to talk to Xu, saying that Shanghai cannot not talk about conscription, otherwise, people from the countryside will all come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fei Shusheng spoke eloquently on the issue of military service, refuting Xu Yongzuo and considering it an insult.</p>
<p>Zhu Wende asked a unique question, raising issues about land value tax. Director Zhu Ping of the Land Bureau was calm on the sidelines because the Land Bureau was not on yesterday's agenda.</p>
<p>The General Assembly was postponed again and again and adjourned at six o'clock. The directors of the various bureaus waiting to answer questions were nervous. They were "liberated" only when the meeting adjourned at six o'clock, waiting to be asked again today.</p>
<p>Four stoves were burning in the meeting place, but there was no heat. It was gloomy, rainy, and cold. Sitting still for four hours, everyone called out that their feet were frozen when the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Many Areas of Health Care Still Need Improvement</h3>
<p>Questioning the Health Bureau, in addition to garbage trucks carrying passengers and cargo, Jiang Hao also asked: (1) The Health Bureau is a business organization and should focus on the development of medical services. Recently, it has not been paying for the expenses of municipal hospitals, but instead, it is ordering them to be self-sufficient, and the cost of diagnosis and treatment has increased, which increases the burden on the people and violates the principle of public welfare. (2) It is said that clinics should be distributed in various districts, just like schools. Recently, they have been ordered to be concentrated and merged, which is also inappropriate. (3) The issue of feces has become an open secret. In the past, those who handled it had the nickname "King." After the victory against Japan, the government changed it to be run by the public sector. Recently, I heard that they are going to implement a contract system again, which is wrong. (4) If the Health Bureau reduces its operations, will it also reduce personnel? Wang Lizhan asked: (1) Last year's epidemic prevention work only averaged about 1 percent of the city's population per injection. The spread of the epidemic was not large. One cannot say that the work was successful, but only that it was fortunate. How will this be improved this year? (2) The last General Assembly resolved to establish health clinics and dental clinics everywhere, but only the establishment of health clinics has been reported, and dental clinics have not been reported at all. According to the health expenditure, there is still one year left in the budget. Why can't it be promoted?</p>
<h3>Military Service Issue, Different Opinions; Xu Yongzuo Believes It Should Not Be Enforced, Fei Shusheng Says It Can Be Used to Strengthen Physical Fitness</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Regarding the military service issue, Senators Xu Yongzuo and Fei Shusheng raised it in yesterday's General Assembly, but their opinions were quite different, which made the atmosphere in the arena tense. According to Senator Xu, conscription will begin this year. In the past, I saw the conscription situation in the interior and was terrified. After eight years of resistance against Japan, the people suffered greatly. I hope to give the people a rest. China has a volunteer army system, so there is no need for compulsion. Unlike the United Kingdom and the United States, where life is stable and people are unwilling to be regular soldiers, compulsion is necessary. Currently, the government is reducing the army on one hand and conscripting on the other, is this not contradictory? Some people say that serving in the army is an obligation, which is stipulated in the constitution. However, the constitution has not yet been implemented, and the rights that the people should have have not been obtained, so the obligation should also be fulfilled more slowly. Especially the people of Shanghai, who have lived in the city for too long, have weakened physiques. Recruiting them for military service will result in either young master soldiers or old master soldiers, and they will lose their lives before training is completed. The country's conscription facilities have not yet been established. Is it going to order the people to send their lives? Therefore, I urge the speaker to request a temporary postponement of conscription of citizens in this city.</p>
<p>Senator Fei disagreed with this point. He said: The constitution stipulates military service. Although the constitution has not yet been implemented, serving in the army is a citizen's obligation. Is it possible that the country does not want it because the rights that should be given in the constitution have not been obtained? At the same time, if you say that the rights have not been obtained, who gave us all the rights that the people have now? If you say that the citizens of Shanghai have weak physiques and cannot be regular soldiers, this is really the greatest shame for the people of Shanghai. If the people are not physically strong, are they worthy of being citizens of China? Moreover, conscription does not necessarily mean going to war. This is a good opportunity to strengthen physical fitness. However, I hope that the Civil Affairs Bureau will seriously consider this matter and prevent abuses from arising.</p>
<h3>Families of Victims of Plane Crash Decide to Jointly File a Private Prosecution</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The "Committee to Seek Justice for the Passengers Killed in the December 25 Plane Crash" continued to meet at the New Life Club yesterday morning to discuss measures for the aftermath and to seek justice. On the spot, it was decided to take steps to demand the punishment of the perpetrators. The investigation has been stopped, so the families decided to file a private criminal prosecution against China and Central Airlines. They will collect materials and evidence within a few days and convene all family members again to write a petition, sign it, and seal it before submitting it to the court. Yesterday, the committee also publicly agreed to have each family contribute 100,000 [currency unit] as litigation and other expenses and to use the Law Office of Le Junwei as the office. They are determined to negotiate with the company and the authorities to the end.</p>
<h3>Major Thieves Caught: Stealing Military Pants from Yongxing Warehouse, and Sugar and Tobacco from Haikang Ship</h3>
<p>[Our Report] On December 22nd of last year, around 4:30 AM, four thieves, Cai Hongsheng, Li Wanyin, Li Wanqing, and Wu Wanyuan, arrived at the Yongxing Warehouse opposite the Huishan Wharf in eastern Shanghai. One acted as a lookout, while the others broke open the warehouse and stole seven large packages of American military pants, each containing fifty pairs. They transported them to No. 24 Taoyuan Lane, Huimin Road, to hide them in Tang Caikang's home. The following morning, around 4:00 AM, they returned to the same location to steal another six large packages, intending to move them again. Unexpectedly, they were discovered by patrolmen stationed at the warehouse just a few steps away, and they abandoned the loot and fled without a trace. The stolen goods were then seized by the Water Police Investigation Department. On New Year's Eve, the Water Police Sub-bureau received a tip and dispatched police officers to investigate and arrest the thieves Cai Hongsheng, Li Wanyin, Li Wanqing, and Wu Wanyuan. However, the receiver of stolen goods, Tang Caikang, escaped. Only his wife, Zhu Sannan, was taken to the bureau for investigation. According to Cai Hongsheng's confession, Tang had Letonghe deliver 20 pairs of American military pants to him on the afternoon of the 29th of the month, and the rest were divided among them.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Water Police Chief Pan Ruiqi and Police Officer Dai Youfu were on duty on the Haikang ship in the Huangpu River around 7:00 AM on the 2nd when they spotted a suspicious small boat with three people on board attempting to steal from the ship. They immediately took the three to the bureau for interrogation. It was revealed that one was Jin Xiaoxiazi (25 years old, from Yangzhou, living on a boat in Longhua Port), one was Guo Shirong (from Chongming, 28 years old, living on Zhangjiabang Road, Pudong), and one was Yuan Chunsai (from Gaoyou, 29 years old, living at No. 20 Yanjiataki, Pudong). According to Yuan Chunbao's confession: "I'm a boat rower. Jin Xiaoxiazi and Guo Shirong, along with someone named Li (who is now at large), hired my boat to steal things from the Haikang ship. The first time, around 2:00 AM, we stole a large wooden crate of Pan cigarettes and a sack of white sugar (weighing about 100 catties) from the ship and took it to Dongjiadu in Pudong. The second time, around 4:00 AM, we were arrested before we could steal anything." According to Jin Xiaoxiazi and Yuan Shirong's confessions, the stolen goods were hidden in a tea house at the Dongjiadu dock. Upon receiving the report, the Water Police Bureau dispatched police officers to retrieve all the stolen goods. It is understood that the stolen goods belong to Chengxin Chang Company at No. 2 Hengye Lane, Jiangxi Road, and were intended to be shipped to Qingdao. The Water Police Bureau has notified them to claim the goods.</p>

<h3>The District Attorney's Office is Busy with Bail Procedures: More Than 100 Suspects in Minor Cases Happily Released From Prison; Procedures Will Be Completed After the Detailed Amnesty Rules Arrive</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Since the Central Government has issued an amnesty decree, although the detailed rules of the amnesty have not yet been announced, the prosecutors of the District Attorney's Office, in order to show consideration for the suspects in custody, have selected cases that are relatively minor and clearly fall within the scope of the amnesty. They have allowed them to be released on bail first, and will complete the overall release procedures after the detailed rules for the implementation of the amnesty are received. More than 80 suspects were allowed to be released on bail the day before yesterday, and more than 50 were allowed to be released yesterday, bringing the total to more than 140 in the past two days. The forensic doctors are busy with bail procedures and other matters, and they are working until late at night. It is expected that a large number of defendants will apply for bail in the next two days. However, this is not a formal amnesty release, but a preparatory work by the prosecutors before the amnesty.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter visited a person in charge of the Shanghai Prison, who told us: After the amnesty decree was issued, among the more than 4,000 prisoners detained in the prison, more than 3,000 ordinary criminals met the standards for commutation or exemption from punishment. It will not be possible to determine who can be released and who can have their sentences reduced until the detailed measures are received. The remaining 700-odd traitors have all violated item one of Article B of the amnesty decree and have no hope of commutation. He expressed considerable doubt about the news that the Capital District Court had released more than 30 prisoners, because the detailed measures have not yet been announced and there is no way to follow them. It is likely that those whose crimes have been determined have been allowed to go out on bail first.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Since the National Government issued the amnesty decree, all sectors have been paying close attention and speculating about which defendants will be pardoned and which defendants will have their sentences reduced. A reporter interviewed a legal expert, who said that the amnesty is a special grace of the state, and the scope of this amnesty is very broad. Except for traitors and corrupt officials, all will be pardoned or have their sentences reduced. However, before the detailed rules for the implementation of the amnesty are announced, it is not convenient to make a definite judgment on the fate of the defendants in each case. For example, the famous grain loan case, according to the prosecutor's indictment, involves the regulations on the management of agriculture, industry, and commerce during the extraordinary period, and should indeed be included in the amnesty. However, the case is in the process of trial, and the judge has the right to change the new articles according to law. If the sentence is imposed according to the regulations on punishing corruption, it cannot be pardoned. Recently, it has been rumored that the court will declare "non-acceptance" of the case, which seems impossible. The so-called amnesty is because the person is guilty and needs to be pardoned. Although the original sentence and the crime committed cannot be prosecuted again after the amnesty, it is different from "insufficient evidence" and "the crime cannot be established." If the examination law and the lawyer law stipulate that those who have been subject to criminal punishment are not allowed to participate in the college entrance examination or practice law. This kind of restriction on passive qualifications is very beneficial to the country and society and should not be affected by the amnesty. In other words, even if someone has been sentenced to imprisonment for a criminal case and has been pardoned, they still cannot immediately participate in the college entrance examination or become a lawyer. Because the person still has "traces of crime," their passive qualifications are different from those who have never committed a crime. President Cha of the District Court has repeatedly stated that the trial of each case should proceed as usual, and that even cases that are expected to be pardoned or reduced must be handled through judicial procedures. According to Article 294, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law, those who have been granted amnesty should be given a judgment of dismissal. Therefore, it is expected that the court will apply this procedure to all amnesty cases.</p>

<h3>Wang Renshan's Interrogation Ends; Bao Qihuang Returns to Beijing to Report</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After Wang Renshan, the director of the Jiangwan Ordnance Depot branch of the First Supply District of the Logistics Command, surrendered himself, the Ministry of National Defense sent Chief Military Justice Bao Qihuang to Shanghai again for trial.

<h3>The End of the Oehler Case: The Defendant Presents Favorable Evidence</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The final conclusion of the Oehler espionage case is approaching. Like a lengthy drama, the gongs and drums have reached the final act. Yesterday morning, the defense began to present favorable evidence in the US military court. One piece of evidence was an editorial in the Xin Shen Bao during the enemy-puppet period on the Axis Agreement, discussing that the contracting countries should not make peace alone. The purpose of presenting this evidence was to explain that one of the defendants, Jin Kaimai, the former director of the German News Bureau in China, cooperated with the Japanese in propaganda work out of necessity. Another piece of evidence was a diagram drawn by Pukemai of the location of the German News Bureau at No. 3 Daxilu. Also, Oehler himself intended to present two key letters to prove his testimony regarding the measures taken when Germany surrendered, but the court did not accept them because the prosecution believed that the letters were insufficient as evidence. The case will continue to be heard today, and the prosecution will begin to rebut the evidence presented by the defense.</p>
<h3>Moviegoers, Please Keep Your Ticket Stubs: The Theaters are Requesting a Tax Reduction</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Shanghai Cinema Industry Trade Association has appealed to the Shanghai City Council for assistance in requesting the Municipal Finance Bureau to reduce the entertainment tax rate to 25% of the ticket price in accordance with central government regulations. According to reports, the National Government promulgated and amended the Entertainment Tax Law on December 4th of last year, stipulating that the tax rate should be "limited to 25% of the original price," and "no additional taxes or levies should be added under any other name." However, the municipal government is still collecting the tax at a rate of 40%. The members of the association have decided to automatically collect and pay the highest tax rate of 25% of the amended rate starting from the 6th of this month, and request the City Council to grant assistance, include it in the agenda, and recognize the association's decision to reduce the rate according to law.</p>
<p>The association also asked moviegoers in the city to keep the ticket stubs from the 6th of this month. Once the City Council approves the reduction of the entertainment tax rate in this city to 25%, the 15% overcharge will be returned to the audience upon presentation of the ticket stubs.</p>
<h3>The Student Anti-Riot Association Sent Out Representatives to Various Schools Yesterday</h3>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests the Social Affairs Bureau to Implement the Guiding Principles of the Government and Departments; Requests for Increased Base Salaries for Employees Should Be Rejected on File</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to reject the requests of employees in various industries for increased base salaries, which violate the government's orders. The report states: In September 1935, the Shanghai Municipal Government's policy report stated that the handling of labor disputes had the following content: "In May of this year, in accordance with the regulations of the Executive Yuan, the Shanghai Labor-Management Arbitration Committee was established and ordered the committee to implement five measures for handling labor disputes, the first of which is that base salaries should not be increased." Recently, the mayor stated in his speech at the second general meeting of the City Council that the economic crisis, along with high wages and usury, indicated that a short-sighted policy of killing the hen to get the eggs should not be adopted for general wage issues. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs also stated at the meeting of the Cotton Textile Industry Association of the 6th District on January 4th of this year that employee treatment should have a considerable limit. Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs also made a clear statement to stop increasing base salaries. The competent government departments have already made fair policy announcements, which should be faithfully implemented. Unfortunately, recent trends seem to be contrary to this, and it is necessary for the competent officials to act as a third party to fairly adjudicate and persuade, in order to barely maintain the precarious situation. If the government orders are equal to setting up a false front and the precedents are overturned at any time, then the Shanghai industrial and commercial sectors will only collapse completely, which is only a matter of time and not a one-sided speculation. The association is deeply concerned and cautious day and night, and should respectfully submit this report. It is requested that all requests for increased base salaries made by employees in various industries to the employers, under any name, be rejected on file in order to maintain the consistency of the government orders and allow the industrial and commercial sectors to barely survive.</p>

<h3>Xie Jinyuan's Wife Pleads with Tears in Her Eyes: Appealing for Relief for the Lone Army; They Have No Cotton-Padded Clothes for the Coming Winter; Their Hunger and Cold are Extremely Pitiable</h3>
<p>[Our Report] In the winter of 1937, the lone army defended the Sihang Warehouse to the death, protecting Shanghai. The eight hundred warriors, whose actions shocked the international community, have experienced ten years of hardship, wandering and exile. Forty-six of them have returned to Shanghai since the victory. Unfortunately, the lives of these dozens of national heroes are on the verge of hunger and cold and urgently need relief from the authorities and people from all walks of life. Ling Weicheng, the widow of the late Regiment Commander Xie, pleaded for these dozens of national heroes yesterday, and tearfully reported the current situation of the lone army's life to the press in the New Concession at the Lone Army Service Agency on Aosong Road, unable to restrain her grief and indignation. According to Mrs. Xie, these 46 people still have no cotton-padded clothes to wear in this severe winter. They sleep together on the stone floor of the Lone Army Service Agency every night, covering themselves only with burlap bags to keep out the cold. The old, the weak, the disabled, and the sick are on the verge of death. Although Chairman Chiang issued a hand-order to the Enemy-Puppet Property Management Bureau to allocate houses for them to live in, they have not yet been allocated. In order to find work and maintain their livelihood, the lone army has repeatedly petitioned the Municipal Government to allocate a pier, but several months have passed and no effective measures have been taken. The Dada Pier is also not allowing the lone army to work, etc. It is reported that Mrs. Xie originally planned to go to the Nanyang area to raise funds to start a school after the lone army's life was resolved. After the equipment of the Lone Army Factory, which the lone army comrades founded in the Lone Army Camp on Jiaozhou Road, was robbed by the enemy, they have been unable to resume work. In the near future, more than 30 members of the lone army who were released from the Nanyang enemy prisoner-of-war camps will come to Shanghai from Hong Kong. It is hoped that the authorities and people in Shanghai will provide them with relief on the condition of exchanging labor for a living.</p>
<h3>The Joint Transportation and Operation Office is Discussing the Takeover of the UNRRA Water Transport Team</h3>

<h3>Trial of a Murder Case: Paramour Claims Sole Responsibility; Shameless Woman Denies Involvement; Deceased's Mother Seeks Compensation</h3>
<p>[Our report] Cheng Cuiyun, a female worker at the Shenxin Textile Factory, and her paramour Xu Meifang, were publicly tried yesterday at the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court for the joint murder of Cheng's husband, Gu Yucai. Cheng Cuiyun is from Chongming, currently 30 years old. She married Gu Yucai, a fellow villager, at the age of 18. A year after the marriage, Cheng came to Shanghai to work at the Shenxin Textile Factory. During the Anti-Japanese War, Cheng left the factory and returned to her hometown. In March of last year, she returned to Shanghai to work at the factory, residing at the home of Xinghua, a fellow factory worker, at 7 Tanjiachiao Road, Zhabei. Through Xinghua's introduction, she became acquainted with Xu Meifang, a neighbor. Xu, from Suzhou, is 35 years old and works as a carpenter. His wife had passed away. After meeting Cheng, he began living with her,</p>
<p>as if husband and wife.</p>
<p>In October of last year, Cheng returned to Chongming. Her husband, Gu Yucai, asked her to find him a job in Shanghai and gave her 800,000 yuan in cash to take to Shanghai, in case he couldn't find a job and needed capital for a small business. Cheng returned to Shanghai first, agreeing that her husband would come to Shanghai around the tenth day of the tenth lunar month. After returning to Shanghai with the money, Cheng Cuiyun secretly plotted with Xu Meifang to murder Gu. On the tenth day, Gu Yucai came to Shanghai, and Cheng Cuiyun</p>
<p>met him at the dock.</p>
<p>She took him to a restaurant for a simple meal and then to the Wing On Department Store and the Tianyun Lou for entertainment. Around 7 PM, she pretended to have arranged a meeting with someone who could introduce him to a job, luring her husband to take a car to the North Railway Station. After getting off the car, they walked together, turning from Qiujiang Road into Zhongxing Road. At the intersection of Yuyaotang Road, the area was desolate and dark. Xu Meifang, who had been secretly following them all day, saw his opportunity. He produced a pre-prepared hemp rope, rushed up from behind, and violently tightened it around Gu's neck. Cheng also assisted in strangling him to death, and they threw the body into a ditch. Cheng and Xu fled home, believing that the matter was</p>
<p>secret and unknown.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the police station uncovered the details and arrested Cheng and Xu, transferring them to the District Prosecutor's Office, where the prosecutor filed a public prosecution. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Shaochang presided over the trial. Xu directly admitted to killing Gu, claiming he acted alone. Cheng also denied participating in the murder of her husband. Gu Yucai's 71-year-old mother also came to court yesterday, filing a civil suit seeking 20 million yuan in living expenses and the 800,000 yuan previously handed over. The court hearing was adjourned for another session, and both defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>[Our report] General He Zhuguo, who went to the United States last spring to treat his eye disease, returned to the country on the American Great Northern Company's "Wildcat" ship on the 31st of last month, arriving in Shanghai. He is currently staying at a friend's home and plans to go to Hangzhou for a two-year long-term recovery within the shortest possible time. When the reporter visited yesterday, he said: Since participating in an international banquet in September of the year before last, he soon suffered from eye disease and eventually became completely blind. He went to the United States for treatment in February of last year. After being diagnosed by famous doctors at the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, they all said that He's optic nerves were not injured or caused by fatigue. If he can get a long-term suitable recovery, he can expect to regain his sight in two or three years. Because the cost in the United States is high, He decided to return to the country and stay in Hangzhou for recovery. He had a lot of contact with people from all walks of life in the United States, hoping that our country would take this opportunity to build the country, achieve peaceful unification, and engage in the great cause of revitalization.</p>
<h3>Traffic Police Destroy Yue Opera Theater, Reprimanded After Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Our report] The Guotai Yue Opera Theater on Xichang Road was destroyed on New Year's Day by soldiers from the traffic police brigade due to a dispute over watching the opera. More than 20 soldiers were arrested on the spot by the 23rd Regiment of the Gendarmerie and sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. Yesterday, the military law office summoned Zhang Chunfan, the manager of the Guotai Theater, and Li Zaiping, the captain of the traffic police brigade. Both parties expressed their willingness to reconcile. The military law office said that the case was a matter of injury and damage, which is a crime that is prosecuted only upon complaint. Since both parties are willing to reconcile, they can refuse to accept it. The more than 20 soldiers involved were reprimanded and released, and Li was ordered to take them back and strictly discipline them.</p>
<h3>Port Affairs Committee Patrols, Cracks Two Smuggling Cases in New Year, Pure Antimony Worth Billions, Goods Moved to YMCA, Owners Released on Bail</h3>
<p>[Our report] Zhong Jie, director of the Patrol and Security Team of the Shanghai Port Affairs Reorganization Committee, received a tip on the evening of the 31st of last month that the Shalilai tugboat, moored at the Rihui Port pier, was carrying smuggled goods. Director Zhong dispatched personnel to the scene on the morning of New Year's Day, together with the Rihui Port Water Police Station, and seized the goods and the smugglers. The smuggled goods included 100 cartons of Camel cigarettes, six wool blankets, 46 and a half dozen long silk dance socks, 92 bundles of four-strand wool, two cans of coffee, one raincoat, 14 pieces of pure wool fabric, and three woolen sweaters, one coat fabric, etc., worth more than 30 million yuan. The owner claimed to be Li Abao, manager of the Central Laundry Company, who colluded with the ship's crew members Zhou Sen, Yu Xingming, and others to hide the smuggled goods in the laundry and transport them to the pier. All the smuggled goods were confiscated by the team and handed over to the Jianghai Customs for safekeeping the day before yesterday, and the owners and crew members were released on bail. On January 3, inspector Chen Qi of the team reported that the owner, Dai Shenzhou, had shipped 643 blocks of pure antimony weighing 12,008 kilograms (approximately over 12 tons) worth several hundred million yuan from Hankou on the Chufu ship, which arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month and was unloaded at the Swire Pier and hidden in a secret room at 6A Taikang Road. Based on the report, the team went to the address and seized all the antimony blocks. Because it was a national defense metal purchased and sold by the government, the team handed it over to the Foreign Trade Office of the Resources Committee. The owner, Dai Shenzhou, was temporarily allowed to be released on bail. The team has submitted a request for commendation to encourage informants and investigators.</p>
<h3>Diminished Curiosity, Business at American Goods Malls Plummets</h3>
<p>[Our report] Last September, due to the municipal government's crackdown on American goods vendors, American goods malls sprang up in response, and their business was better than that of ordinary stores. However, in recent months, due to foreign exchange supply and demand and other factors, orders from various businesses to the United States have greatly decreased, and the general public's curiosity and enthusiasm for American goods have also decreased day by day, resulting in a sharp decline in business at American goods malls. Currently, malls such as Daguan and Small World are also engaged in domestic goods, and Sino-American malls have also combined Chinese and Western elements. According to Sino-American business</p>
<h3>Another Blacklisted Female Star: Yan Yuexian Sadly Imprisoned</h3>
<p>[Our report] Film star Yan Yuexian, 29 years old, residing at No. 12, Lane 930, Zhongzheng Middle Road, was arrested for opium addiction. At around 5 PM on December 25th of last year, she went to an opium den in Hengmaoli, Xizang South Road, to indulge when police officers from the Changshu branch suddenly arrived for inspection. Yan and the opium den owner were arrested and taken to the police station. When questioned, Yan denied smoking, claiming that she had already quit and was only visiting friends. Upon instruction, she was sent to the Municipal Hospital for testing, and the results confirmed that Yan had opium addiction. She was brought back to the police station for questioning and was sent to the District Court yesterday. At around 3 PM, her younger sister, Yan Yueleng, and another person went to the court detention center to visit her. The sisters cried non-stop upon meeting. The person in charge of the mall said that when the mall was established last October, the total daily turnover was about 10 million yuan, but in November and December, it had decreased to 2 million yuan. However, compared with domestic goods, American goods still occupy an advantage. The business situation of pure domestic goods malls is even worse.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Medical and Health</h3>
<p>(1) Vision Deterioration</p>
<p>Ma Zhihong asks: I suffered from eye redness last summer for about a month. Since then, my left eye feels foggy when I look at things. The center point is clearer, but I can't see around it. I went to an ophthalmologist for treatment for about half a month, but it didn't work. I am very panicked, but I don't know how to treat it. Please tell me: (1) Can pupils that are too small be enlarged? (2) Is it dangerous if I need surgery? (3) Why does reading medical reports make me feel pain? (4) No need</p>
<p>[Answered by Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD]: For the eye disease described in your letter, please ask various ophthalmologists to study and treat it in detail. If surgery is required, it is advisable to ask a skilled person to perform it. There are many blood tonifying injections, which should be decided after examination, such as small bovine liver injections.</p>
<p>(2) Thyroiditis</p>
<p>Zhao Guangmei asks: I suffer from a rough and swollen neck, which flares up from time to time. It starts with shortness of breath, then phlegm and wheezing, and the neck becomes hard and swollen. After taking three to five doses of Chinese medicine to calm the qi and resolve phlegm, it gets better. However, the rough and swollen neck remains the same after recovery. Each time it recurs, it gets worse. Western doctors diagnose it as thyroiditis. The radical cure is surgery, but the patient is firmly against it. Please answer: (1) What is the cause of the disease? How should it be treated other than surgery? (2) What medicine can be taken to cure it? (3) What are the emergency treatment methods when it occurs?</p>
<p>[Answered by Dr. Gu Yuqi, MD]: If it is indeed goiter, then there will be heart palpitations and hand tremors. The neck is hard and swollen, so a detailed diagnosis must be made to confirm it. The treatment method must be surgery for a radical cure. Internally take Antithyreoid Tab (Moebeus)</p>

<h3>Economic Statistics Expert Li Zhennan Discusses Price Trends Over the Past Year: Unless Fundamental Problems Are Solved, Any Economic Measures Will Be Difficult to Be Effective</h3>
<p>[Our report] In order to review the economic and financial situation of the city in the past and to anticipate its future development, the reporter specially visited economic statistics expert Dr. Li Zhennan yesterday, who kindly agreed to meet. Dr. Li first showed statistical charts, listing the price changes of rice, flour, cotton yarn, raw silk, gold, US dollars, Chinese stocks, and government bonds. The starting point of these curves was October 1945, until the opening of the foreign exchange market in early March of last year. During this stage, the price curves of various goods were almost consistently rising in a straight line. After the opening of the foreign exchange market until August 19th of last year, when the foreign exchange rate was adjusted, rice prices fluctuated slightly due to uneven supply and demand, while gold and US dollars were almost stable as parallel lines. However, Chinese stocks tended to rise before mid-June. This was driven by frequent news of the opening of the stock exchange and the stable gold and US dollar exchange rates. After the exchange rate adjustment on August 19, the price curves of various goods fluctuated and rose again. However, Chinese stocks fell sharply due to the impact of the economic downturn. In early December of last year, due to tight credit, the price curves of various goods fell slightly. However, by the end of that month, the curves rose sharply again. Therefore, looking at the price curves of various goods over the past year, although there may have been periods of stability in the short term, the long-term trend was still upward. Dr. Li specifically pointed out that in a country where public security is unstable, the currency system is unstable, the budget cannot be balanced, and international trade imports exceed exports, the upward trend of prices is almost unavoidable. If the above-mentioned situations cannot be improved this year, then although the trend of goods may be affected by speculative factors or tight capital in the short term, the long-term trend will still be upward. Moreover, with domestic prices at a high level and imports exceeding exports, it is almost impossible for my country's international payments to be balanced. In the past year, my country's average monthly import value was about six times the export value. Therefore, he firmly believes that the government's subsequent policies will focus on strengthening the control of import trade to make up for the shortcomings of past foreign exchange management policies.</p>
<p>He said: Gold and US dollars are non-productive goods, but people still compete to buy them. This phenomenon can indicate two facts: (1) Faith in the already inflated currency has been lost. (2) There is no outlet for funds. In other words, there is a lack of profitable businesses to pursue. He also pointed out that before the various fundamental problems are resolved, the government's economic policies often cannot be fully implemented and are mostly both beneficial and harmful. Now let's give a few examples to illustrate it. After the implementation of the import permit system, the benefit is that it can maintain foreign exchange resources and promote domestic industry and commerce. The disadvantage is that after foreign goods cannot be imported as much as possible, the high price level in the country is implicitly supported. The central bank's gold policy benefits by contracting the currency, which can slightly curb the rise in prices. The disadvantage is that it can also freeze useful funds from the private sector, turning them into useless things, which is also not a fundamental solution. Issuing production loans benefits by assisting industrial production. The disadvantage is that it simply increases market funds and easily causes speculative storms. Another example is high interest rates, which are generally hated by people. However, high interest rates can have the effect of curbing price increases. Therefore, as summarized above, if domestic security, the currency system, and the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure are not resolved, then any economic policies of the government are only temporary and stopgap measures.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Initially Hesitant, Then Rise; Foreign Currencies Remain Mediocre</h3>
<p>Gold prices were stable yesterday, opening at 3.5 million. There was no special change after the opening. From 3.56 million, it once fell below 3.5 million, seeing a low price of 3.48 million before stabilizing slightly. After 10 AM, the central bank allocated 200 taels at 3.5 million. After that, the supply disappeared, retail purchases were numerous, and the price was firm. After noon, due to strong real demand, it rose to above 3.55 million. In the afternoon, forward purchases were numerous, and the market immediately jumped to 3.64 million. The central bank was forced to respond and re-imposed pressure, immediately reducing it to 3.54 million. It finally strengthened slightly, and the result was an increase of 55,000 from the previous close. Gold ornaments were 376,000. Silver dollars rose slightly. The interbank lending market went from loose to flooded. Interest rates seemed to fall below 1.5%.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies remained mediocre yesterday. The initial black market rate for US dollars in the morning was 6,100 to 6,300. Midway, it was extremely peaceful. At noon, it rose slightly with gold, to 6,300 to 6,500. Although the gold market was firm in the afternoon, the dollar market had a supply of funds but did not see a rise. Buying and selling prices were slightly squeezed together, and asking prices seemed low. The result was a slight increase of 50 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were constrained by telegraphic transfers and did not show any strength. The result was a further decline of 20 yuan from the previous close. Transactions were rare, and few people cared about it. The Guangdong community had a small supply and demand.</p>
<h3>Ripples in Well Water, Government Bonds Active Again</h3>
<p>Government bonds were still stirring yesterday. The Shanghai Municipal Council's call for support for buying was still regarded as the golden rule by major bond market players, who arbitrarily raised the price. Tong Bing opened at 1,900 yuan with demand, and under the leadership of Chen and others, it rose to 3,000 yuan before Room 604 sold on behalf of the Shanghai Silk and Flowers community and returned to 2,500 yuan at the close, an increase of more than 600 yuan from the previous close. A and B rose 500 yuan, and D and E rose 600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Purchases Not Yet Sufficient, China Trust Decides to Continue Purchases</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau, which has been acting as an agent for the government to purchase raw silk since October of last year, had purchased a total of 6,345 bales of raw silk by the end of the year. According to the person in charge of the bureau, because this is still far from the original target of 10,000 bales, the bureau will continue to purchase raw silk this year, regardless of the quantity.</p>
<p>The Japanese rayon purchased by the Central Trust Bureau has arrived in Shanghai in two batches of 5,000 boxes each. The third batch has already departed from Tokyo and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, also with a quantity of 5,000 boxes.</p>
<h3>Measures for Purchasing Cotton Yarn, Draft Already Prepared</h3>
<p>[Our report] The government's measures for purchasing cotton yarn are currently being drafted separately by the Textile Management Committee and the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association. It is reported that the Textile Management Committee has already prepared the entire draft, which will generally entrust the Textile Construction Company to handle the purchase and sale of cotton yarn. The Sixth District Association is also studying the technical issues of its purchase. The association will convene a standing council meeting today, at which a decision is expected to be made. However, the final measures still need to be approved at tomorrow's Textile Management Committee meeting.</p>
<h3>Textile Merchants Offer Low Prices, Cotton Yarn Market Sales Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was unable to rally. Textile merchants were willing to offer low prices, such as Caikui Xing, which was sold for only 2.023 million yuan. However, sales were quiet, and transactions were scarce. The various yarns above 10 counts fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan again. The 32-count fine yarn was still selling well, and Yinyue still held its original price. Wucai Xing, Bama, Shiquan, and others also fell by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan from the previous day's market. The trend was still fragile.</p>
<h3>China Textile's Allocation of Printed Cotton Cloth, Will Replace New Number Certificates</h3>
<p>Customers allocated printed cotton cloth by the China Textile Company must all re-register from the New Year. It is learned that the company is scheduled to open goods with the newly registered number from the 15th of this month. Customers who have not re-registered must re-register before the 15th to receive the new registration number. The old registration number will be completely invalidated from the 15th.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Cloth, and Miscellaneous Grains Transported to Taiwan, American Timber Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our report] The China Merchants Bureau's Haiqian ship left Shanghai for Keelung yesterday, loading more than 2,030 bags of beans, more than 7,000 pieces of bean cakes, more than 780 pieces of textiles, 170 pieces of cotton yarn, and 97 pieces of cotton.</p>
<p>Also, the Feier Yeweilan (transliteration), managed by the Fulai Company, arrived in Shanghai from Colombo yesterday afternoon, transporting 5 million feet of raw materials. It berthed at pontoons 14 and 15 for unloading.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Strengthens Anti-Smuggling, Plans Comprehensively for Sea, Land, and Air</h3>
<p>Regarding smuggling in this city, according to Jianghai Customs: Although the customs has stationed personnel and anti-smuggling vessels at Wusongkou for strict patrols, it is indeed impossible to inspect the import of warships. The customs has recently paid special attention to these warships. If luggage and articles cannot be inspected on warships, the customs can inspect them after they are unloaded on the wharf. The customs is also paying full attention to aircraft smuggling and is determined to eliminate this smuggling situation. As for the recent abundance of American goods on the market, it is said that they may be goods that were previously stockpiled.</p>
<h3>China Trust's Allocation Postponed, Rayon Rose Sharply Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>The market price of rayon was first stable and then high yesterday. No. 120 Takayama Yukari opened at more than 3.1 million yuan. Later, due to the postponement of the 18th allocation of rayon by the Central Trust Bureau due to incomplete audit work, the news spread to the market, and people took the opportunity to raise prices. Asking prices rose sharply. By noon, it was 350,000 yuan, and it rose another 50,000 yuan in the afternoon. The smallest price was about 300,000 yuan higher than the previous night. Other semi-gloss goods had no transactions, but asking prices were also brought up by more than 100,000 yuan. The factory's economic situation was calm, and ordinary five-load open goods were quoted at 4.55 million yuan yesterday. A few loads of dry goods were also traded in retail, with prices at 3.12 million and 170,000 yuan. There was little difference between the silk market and the previous day. Meea quilt fabrics were at 2.65 million yuan. Huajin crepe was 400 yuan in the morning. Because the raw materials increased in the afternoon, the asking price also increased by 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Overcoat Fabrics Fall Frequently</h3>
<p>The trend of overcoat fabrics on the public tea party these days is weaker than that of any other product. Retail sellers are constantly calling out lower prices, while buyers are less interested, and the market is falling more. Because the date of sale is already late, once they are put aside, they must wait for half a year. Both parties' discount rates are related.</p>
<h3>Fancy Woolens Flourish</h3>
<p>Various fancy woolens that may be sold in the spring, whether suit materials or ordinary goods, and those made of fine wool, have all been rising in recent days, both from incoming routes and from local factories. Due to the difficulty in placing orders, the prices of wool fabrics have been stable or falling for more than two months. Stores with substantial financial strength have been secretly buying, and factory prices have been raised one after another. Distant customers have also been making inquiries.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Distributes Early</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the shortage of spot goods in the sugar market, market prices have risen again. It is reported that Taiwan Sugar Company has decided to distribute the first batch of Taiwan sugar for this year early on Thursday (the 9th) in order to suppress sugar prices. The total amount will reach more than 10,000 tons, and unlimited supply will still be adopted.</p>
<h3>Temporary End to Yarn Allocation; Cotton Yarn Returns to Free Trade</h3>
<p>The final allocation of cotton yarn for the fourth period, conducted by the six district textile guilds, was completed yesterday, the 6th. It was also decided that yarn allocation work would not continue after this and would be temporarily suspended. As for the issue of the Cotton Yarn Control Committee purchasing half of the cotton yarn production from various yarn factories in the city, and the handling of these purchases, detailed measures are still being drafted. These measures will need to be voted on in meetings, which will take time. During this transitional period, yarn allocation has been suspended, and new measures have not yet been implemented. However, the cotton yarn needed for various industries cannot be stopped. Regarding how to handle this, the six district guilds previously sought instructions from the Cotton Yarn Control Committee. The Committee submitted the issue to the first yarn price review committee meeting of the year, which decided that in the future, various industries could freely purchase the yarn and cloth they needed from textile factories. As for the price, it should be based on the adjusted prices of the last distribution of the fourth period, allowing buyers and sellers to freely negotiate, but the market price should not deviate too far from the adjusted price.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake Business Tax; Ministry of Finance Refuses Exemption</h3>
<p>Last year, the Grain and Oil Cake Business Association submitted a document to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that business tax be exempted for oil cakes made from beans, citing previous examples. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce then telegraphed the Ministry of Finance on their behalf. It has now been learned that the Ministry of Finance has replied, stating that the regulations for exempting grain businesses from business tax are limited to rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, and flours made from them that can serve as staple foods. Bean oil is only a non-staple food, and the raw materials have already been processed. Bean cake is used for fertilizing farmland and is not food, so it cannot be included in the scope of the grain business. The request for business tax exemption cannot be approved. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already replied to the Grain Business Association.</p>
<h3>Tinplate Stability</h3>
<p>After the New Year, steel plate prices rose again from 1.7 million to 2 million. It is said that recent arrivals have stabilized the market. The price of 26-gauge tinplate continues to rise. 24-gauge is extremely scarce. Double and small tinplate prices remain stable. This is because tinplate imports are scarce, while the demand for can manufacturing and yarn factory rollers is great, so the market situation is difficult to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Market Situation Turns Upside Down; Chinese Stocks Regain Upper Hand</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks initially fell yesterday but then rose. Short sellers rushed to cover, and the situation gradually changed. Loan stimulation benefited small stocks, which became popular. The morning opening continued slightly lower, but buyers were active when prices were low. After prices stabilized, they fluctuated. Stocks such as 151, 61, 232, 14, 76, 160, 224, 83, and 89 were successively bought. Although stocks like 212, 47, and 152 were supplied, there were more buyers than sellers. There was covering outside the market, and retail investors were resisting short positions. Stocks like 224, 76, 4, 78, and 14 were actively bought, repeatedly pushing prices up to a high of 597 yuan in forward trading. Stocks like 212 and 68 were sold. At this time, the spot price opened 15 yuan higher, and sales were active, causing a temporary drop of more than ten yuan. Ultimately, with the gold market very stable, stocks like 160 and 14 were bought again. At noon, both spot and forward prices broke through the 600 yuan mark, ending at high prices. Under favorable conditions, New Guang was close to the limit up, remaining stable after closing. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Sha and American Asia and Jingfu rose less than 10%, while New Guang and Qinxing rose more than 10%, Xinhe rose 5%, and Huafeng rose slightly. Cold stock, underwear, rose 5%. Other stocks experienced mixed ups and downs. In forward trading, Yong Sha and New Guang rose less than 10%, and Huafeng rose slightly. The afternoon opening was expensive, and gold prices recovered, leading to a high opening. Stocks like 186, 224, 232, and 212 were actively sold. Although stocks like 145 and 97 were bought, prices still fell. Stocks like 12, 76, and 68 were sold again, and forward trading reached 597 yuan, while spot trading reached 594 yuan. Stocks like 198 and 145 were still being bought. New Guang's forward trading first announced limit up. After that, although there were many small positions, stocks like 145 and Er Jiu were bought for spot Yong Sha, and stocks like 97, 224, 28, and 85 were actively bought. Underwear, Jingfu, New Guang, American Asia, and Jinglun also resolutely rose to the limit. Near the close, the short squeeze was strong, and retail investors poured in. Commerce also announced limit up. The entire market was dazzling, and it closed again at high prices. Compared to the previous close, Yong Sha, American Asia, Jingfu, and New Guang each rose 10% to 15%, Xinhe and Qinxing rose less than 10%, and Huafeng rose 5%. Cold stocks, Commerce, underwear, and Jinglun all announced limit up. Matches also rose more than 10%, Li'an rose 10%, and the rest were stable. In forward trading, Yong Sha, American Asia, Xinhe, and New Guang each rose 10% to 15%, and Huafeng rose 5%. Stocks outside the market continued to be popular.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were slightly stable yesterday. Wheelock Marden continued to advance. As a result, compared to the previous close, Wheelock Marden and Jardine Matheson rose slightly, English United and Guang Paper were flat, Jardine Brewery fell 5%, and Navigation and Steel fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Tight Money; Kun Dian Suffers; Grain Market Turns Weak</h3>
<p>Today, a total of more than 11,800 stones of rice arrived in the market from both the north and south. Due to tight money, shopkeepers’ willingness to buy weakened, and the market entered a sluggish state again. Southern japonica rice fell by 2,000 yuan, and northern japonica rice also fell by slightly more than 1,000 yuan. White rice and Yin rice plummeted by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Prices rose and fell suddenly, making it very difficult to predict. The supply from Shantou and Qingdao was particularly large. Raw oil continued to fall by 2,000 yuan. Soybean oil was scarce and remained stable. Vegetable oil rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Clear oil remained stable, while sesame oil continued to rise sharply by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Soybean oil heads were unmoved, and local guards were also idle, falling back slightly by 500 to 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake purchases from Shantou and Xiamen were weak, with a small squeeze of 100 to 300 yuan. Broad beans were actively traded in small quantities, up by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Cowpeas rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Red beans were slightly weak, down by 300 to 500 yuan. Mung beans remained unchanged. Red sorghum was exceptionally popular, rising by another 1,000 yuan. Corn was firm. Raw peanuts, with increased consumption in Guangdong, became more active again, rising by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Sesame was heavily consumed locally, and Guangdong continued to purchase, soaring into the clouds, rising sharply by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Wheat bran consumption in rural areas resumed, with prices rising by 300 to 400 yuan. Flour sales weakened, falling back by 1,000 yuan. Grain prices mostly fell, with a few rising.</p>
<h3>London Reveals News; Optimistic Outlook for Sino-British Trade</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Although the opinions brought back by the British trade mission have not yet been revealed, they are believed to be very significant. According to well-informed sources, the word "long-term" can barely express even a fraction of it, because short-term possibilities are limited by the chaos within China and the severe shortage still afflicting Britain. Apart from these current difficulties, the general view is that the future is extremely optimistic. Although Britain is unable to lend China or anyone else $500 million in US dollars (the US Export-Import Bank has allocated that amount to lend to China, implementing President Truman's "unified" policy statement of December 15, 1945), Britain still has enormous capacity to engage in trade with China, and what China hopes for is undoubtedly reciprocal trade.</p>
<h3>New York Silver Prices Fall Again; Rumored to Be Due to Large Exchange</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 6th] If a large amount of imported silver continues to be sold, silver prices are expected to fall again. Some people believe that Handy &amp; Harman's price still does not fully reflect the decline in silver prices. It is rumored that a large transaction of more than one million ounces has been discovered, with a price 2 cents US dollars lower than the New York silver price. Another million ounces is now available for purchase, with a price 3 or 4 cents lower than 83 and 1/3 US cents.</p>
<p>Another message: The leading gold and silver broker Handy &amp; Harman's New York silver listing today was 82 and 1/3 US cents per ounce, down 1 cent from Saturday's price.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal Market Price Gradually Decreases</h3>
<p>Although the quoted price for white coal blocks in the coal market remains at the original level, sales are sluggish, and transactions are very few. The first batch of 3,250 tons of white coal scrap for distribution and coal blending has already been allocated. The market situation is likely to temporarily weaken. The bituminous coal market situation is quiet, with frequent sales, and market prices continue to trend downward.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Company Share Subscription Confirmed; Shareholders' Meeting Convened on the 15th</h3>
<p>The 500 million yuan share capital of the city's silk weaving company has been fully subscribed and collection began yesterday. It is reported that a shareholders' meeting will be held on the 15th. Mr. Luo Qinghua will be appointed as chairman of the board, and Cai Yitao and Liu Qingyi will be appointed as general manager and deputy general manager, respectively. Giants from the city's banking industry will also participate in the company's organization and serve as directors.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Company; Silk Purchase; Called Off</h3>
<p>The Sino-American Industrial Company, managed by General Chennault, was previously commissioned by American merchants to purchase a large amount of silk from us, and had negotiated with relevant parties several times. However, because the company's offered price was too low, no results were achieved. According to Mr. Fang Dingou, deputy manager of the company's business department: The previous rumors about purchasing silk on behalf of American merchants have now been called off.</p>
<h3>Only Exporters and Importers Hold Seminar</h3>
<p>At 6:00 PM today, the city's importers and exporters held a trade seminar. More than 100 businesses attended, and members of the city's press were also invited. During the seminar, it was unanimously agreed that the current government's trade policies and the management of trade organizations have many unreasonable aspects, which have adverse effects on the national economy and people's livelihood. Finally, it was decided to establish a research committee to study import and export issues and submit opinions to the government.</p>
<h3>Temporary Management Committee for Imported Goods; Handles Business Registration; Relaxes Deadline for Import Permits</h3>
<p>The temporary management committee for imported goods is handling the registration of businesses dealing with imported goods. As of yesterday, 400 units have been registered. The committee is currently conducting review and investigation work. The first step of this work is to request each bank in the city to report the foreign exchange settlement situation of each business with the bank, and then separately investigate the past trade situation of each business. Currently, 80% of the banks' reports have been sent to the committee. It is expected that the entire review can be completed this month. Businesses that are not approved will not be allowed to operate in the future. The detailed allocation of imported goods to approved businesses will be executed by the industry association entrusted by the committee.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Import Management Committee told reporters yesterday that the import and export trade regulations stipulate that the second category of imported goods listed in the appendix must be imported with quotas. The quota allocation office of the committee formulates the total annual import volume based on domestic needs, and then approves import permits. Since these goods are mostly industrial raw materials or necessities for people's livelihood, the committee has decided to be flexible before the import quota is formulated, and issue import permits in advance, allowing imports. Once the total import volume is stipulated, it will be deducted from the quota. At the same time, the validity period of the permits issued by the committee in November and December of last year was originally scheduled to end at the end of February of this year. Because overseas orders may not be shipped and imported as scheduled, the deadline has been extended by one month to the end of March. The validity period of the permits issued this month is stipulated to be the end of April.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Regularly; Popular Sales of Discounted Coal Balls</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has turned cold, and the Spring Festival is approaching, and the demand for fuel for the general public is even more urgent. The black market price of coal balls has risen from 10,000 yuan per load to 25,000 yuan. In order to eliminate this speculation, the Social Affairs Bureau plans to widely sell discounted coal balls on the 10th of this month (Friday), with the price set at 220,000 yuan per ton, calculated pro rata for retail sales. The current process is for the Fuel Management Committee to transport the allocated white coal scrap to the coal ball factory on the 6th, make it into coal balls, and then distribute it to retailers for widespread sales to suppress the black market for coal balls. It has been decided to convene a meeting of the coal price review committee's coal ball subgroup today (Wednesday) to discuss the general sales methods. Retailer representatives will submit a roster to the joint office. The office currently has 1,100 members. After the Social Affairs Bureau registers and numbers the addresses and distribution quantities of each coal ball store, it will notify the public to purchase nearby. In principle, there will be no limit on purchases for the time being, but it is necessary to queue in order. On the 9th, each retailer will pick up goods from the coal ball factory in their respective districts. The 10th will be the day for the general sale of discounted coal balls. The total amount of coal balls this time is 100,000 tons. Currently, the Fuel Management Committee has allocated 6,000 tons of white coal scrap, so the quantity to be sold continuously from the 10th will be 12,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Fine Silk Machines Cannot Spin Coarse Yarn; Fire Machine Cotton Prospects Dim</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to a cotton spinning industry source, the fire machine cotton produced in counties near Shanghai, especially in Taicang, is of relatively pure quality. However, most of it is only suitable for spinning 10-count and 12-count cotton yarn, and only a few can spin 16-count yarn. However, the consumption standard for cotton yarn has progressed from the coarse-count yarn era to the fine-count yarn era. Therefore, most yarn factory products are now 20-count yarn or higher. And the textile machines in various yarn factories are mostly equipped for spinning fine yarn. Therefore, the amount of raw cotton required for coarse-count yarn has decreased. According to statistics, among the 36 yarn factories participating in the joint distribution of cotton yarn in the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, the amount of raw cotton required for spinning coarse yarn each year is about 100,000 dan. Even for the China Textile Construction Company, most of its textile machines are equipped for fine yarn. Therefore, the amount of raw cotton required for spinning coarse yarn each year is only 20,000 dan. If we want each yarn factory to purchase and spin coarse yarn for the sake of the fire machine cotton's outlet, then spinning coarse yarn with fine yarn machines, although not impossible, will result in each spindle not being able to operate at full capacity, and the production results of each yarn factory will suffer even greater losses. Therefore, the source said: The current situation of fire machine cotton is a tragedy produced by the progress of the times. The fundamental solution is to start by improving cotton varieties, which can be effective. However, this cannot be achieved overnight and will require a considerable amount of time to gradually improve the quality of varieties.</p>

<h3>College Basketball Women's Game: Jiaotong University of Technology Wins, Men's Group: Nantong Defeats Tongde</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The College Basketball League had three games yesterday afternoon at the City Gymnasium. The first game was in the college group, between Tongde and Nantong, refereed by Yang Liecheng and Li Zhenzhong. Both sides played tentatively and committed many fouls. Nantong's center, Wang Huaiding, was formerly a veteran of Renyu, but yesterday, in the chaotic game, he felt like "a hero with no place to use his talents." The second game was in the women's group, between Jiaotong University and Daxia, refereed by Zhu Mingxing. Jiaotong forfeited the previous game to College of Physical Education. Yesterday, Chen Ling personally led the female players to battle, and they were indeed extraordinary, defeating Daxia soundly. The final game was also in the women's group, between the College of Law and College of Physical Education, refereed by Zhang Jufei. The two sides were evenly matched. In the first half, the College of Law led by a narrow margin of 13-12. However, in the second half, the College of Physical Education's guards tightly marked the College of Law's top scorer, You Decui, and ultimately secured the final victory. The game summaries and results are as follows:</p>
<p>Nantong College Defeats Tongde for the First Time</p>
<p>The first game was in the college group, between Tongde and Nantong. Tongde's Song Huanzhang opened the scoring with a long shot. Nantong's Wang Huaiding was effective on both offense and defense. Lu Tong and Gao Bingming added to the score, and Nantong steadily took the lead, finishing the first quarter with a 12-5 advantage. In the second quarter, Tongde's Chen Youmin suddenly rallied, scoring nine points with three throws and two free throws. At halftime, Tongde trailed by one and a half points, with a score of 14-17. In the third quarter, both sides engaged in a chaotic battle, each making some gains. In the final quarter, Nantong's Wang Huaiding had great luck with his shots, scoring ten points himself, resulting in a 39-27 victory over Tongde.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Women Defeat Daxia</p>
<p>The second game was in the women's group, between Daxia and Jiaotong University. Daxia's Chen Xiujing scored the first point with a free throw, followed by Cai Guoying who also scored with a free throw. However, at halftime, they were still far behind, with a score of 4-11. In the third quarter, Jiaotong's Lu Zhaoshan was extremely accurate with her shots, scoring on every attempt, resulting in an absolute advantage of 24-7. In the end, Daxia suffered a crushing defeat of 8-31 against Jiaotong University.</p>
<p>College of Physical Education Women's Team Defeats College of Law</p>
<p>The final game was also in the women's group, between College of Physical Education and College of Law. College of Physical Education's Liu Meilin scored the first point with a free throw. College of Law's You Decui scored on a throw and then another shot. College of Physical Education's captain, Mei Zutong, hastily seized the opportunity and scored two goals, giving College of Physical Education a 5-4 lead in the first quarter. In the second quarter, College of Physical Education's Li Huifang and College of Law's You Decui traded scores, earning applause from the audience. At halftime, College of Law took the lead with a score of 13-12. Switching sides to play again, both teams had tight defenses. College of Law's You Decui, being larger in stature, had no way to deal with College of Physical Education's strong guards. Both sides scored very few points, and the score was tied twice at 14 and 19. At the start of the final quarter, College of Physical Education's captain, Mei Zutong, frowned and scored repeatedly, securing the final victory of 29-22, defeating the College of Law.</p>
<h3>Random Talks About the New Peking University: The Beach Has Changed (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Jingyu</p>
<p>Originally, there were dozens of restaurants from various provinces around Mashen Temple. Back then, many students boarded there. There was braised crucian carp from Jiangsu, and Hunan-style chili chicken, as well as the famous Mr. Zhang's tofu. Now, there are only three or four newly opened simple restaurants with no special flavor.</p>
<p>Mashen Temple Restaurants: Erased the Old Habit of Billing</p>
<p>I remember that the old man in charge of accounting at the Zhongshan Canteen always liked to bring up old accounts. Whenever he couldn't collect debts from students, he would grumble, "It doesn't matter, Chen Gongbo still owes me a lot of money. He is now the Minister of Industry, but I haven't asked him for it." I remember the pair of old copper-framed reading glasses that the old man wore. Now even their shadow is gone. How would he have imagined that Chen Gongbo, who owed him meal money, has accumulated so much debt in recent years that he paid it off with his life, repaying the heavy debt he owed to the Chinese nation?</p>
<p>The restaurants now all take cash, and I've never heard of billing. Before the July 7th Incident, you could deposit five yuan and eat more than ten yuan without settling the account. Even during the summer vacation, if there was no way, the owner would often wait until autumn to settle the account. But now everyone is poor. In the past, there were rich students who could help out, and poor students could owe money for food to get by. But now, the money has changed, the social economy is ruined, and even the owners of the newly opened restaurants have no way to maintain the old traditions.</p>
<p>The Old Gatekeeper of the Red Building: Talking Freely About the Past</p>
<p>The Red Building had been the headquarters of the Japanese Military Police for eight years. No one knows how many men and women were killed in the basement. People in Beiping even said that there was a machine grinder inside, specifically for grinding people. After the university recovered the building, many rooms below are still closed. Everyone says that men and women cry inside at midnight. Old Yang, the gatekeeper of the Red Building, has experienced decades of strange changes. Dynasties have changed several times. Now, all of his teeth have fallen out, and his face has many wrinkles. However, he is still happy to talk about the past in front of people: how Liu Zhe scolded students, how Zhang Baixi (in the winter of 1901, the 27th year of Guangxu, an imperial decree was issued to revive the university, and Zhang Baixi was appointed as the Minister of Management) revived the university, how Principal Cai went to Europe that year, how Jiang Menglin came to be the acting principal, and how young Principal Hu was when he first came as a professor. He can recite all of this like a treasure. Especially for those who became famous after entering Peking University, he naturally watched them grow up, so he would naturally call them by their first names: "Fu Sinian, Gu Jiegang, Tao Xisheng, and Lao Gan of the Central Academy now, didn't they all come from here? The first female teacher was Chen Hengzhe. I haven't seen her for many years. Now there are so many female students and several female teachers, it's not uncommon. I remember the first time there was a female student, Old Master Gu (i.e., Gu Hongming) was so scared that he asked where the 'tangke' (a term for a woman) came from. Chen Duxiu, who was the Dean of the Faculty of Arts here in the early years of the Republic of China, also died a few years ago, I heard. Alas! Time really flies! I'm not going to make it either..." He sighed, and the wrinkles on his forehead became more visible, each line recording the history of Peking University. Then he said, "Zhou Zuoren was reportedly sentenced to fourteen years, but why was Qian Daosun only sentenced to ten years? He took so much, he was always colluding with the Japanese, needless to say..."</p>
<p>The beach has changed, Beiping is also poor, and everyone only has a few worthless pieces of paper money. Now even the students don't buy the hundred-yuan newspapers anymore. The newspaper boys are still standing in front of the Red Building in the afternoon, shouting: "A hundred yuan for two of them! Buy a big newspaper for a hundred yuan! Buy one..." The cold wind, like a sharp blade, cut off their listless calls, losing much of their previous charm. The beach has become ordinary.</p>
<h3>Current State of Sports in Taiwan: Interview with Secretary-General Lin of the Taiwan Provincial Sports Association</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Since Taiwan's recovery, everything has been actively engaged in transformation and construction, and no effort has been spared in the field of sports. However, during the period of occupation, the general youth were influenced by the Japanese spirit of Bushido, which caused sports to have an aggressive character. Mr. Lin Chaoquan, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Sports Association, came to Shanghai a few days ago to observe and to negotiate sports equipment matters. Because the sports venues and other facilities in various parts of Taiwan are very complete, what is most lacking after the recovery is sports equipment, so he hopes that sports equipment companies in Shanghai will provide more assistance.</p>
<p>Sports Activities</p>
<p>Mr. Lin is staying at 178 Lane C3, Hartung Road. Yesterday morning, a reporter visited him and talked about the current state of sports in Taiwan. Mr. Lin said that baseball, swimming, track and field, and rugby are the most popular sports in Taiwan, and they may show their skills in the 7th National Games next year. Football and basketball are relatively weaker, but the youth in the province are physically strong and active, and can easily reach high standards with training.</p>
<p>Sportsmanship</p>
<p>In short, the sports atmosphere in Taiwan is very strong, and the only thing lacking is the spirit. Therefore, he hopes that sports groups in the mainland will visit Taiwan in the role of older brothers and give them some new understanding. He said that he had recently discussed with the person in charge of the Jingwu Athletic Association, hoping that the association's boxing class would go to Taiwan. Because during the occupation, there were boxing matches in Taiwan against Japan and the Philippines, and the level was also quite high, so he very much hopes to learn from each other and make progress. In addition, he also hopes to promote the national martial arts with a national consciousness to replace Japanese Bushido, but there is a great lack of national martial arts teachers in the area, and he sincerely hopes that national martial arts masters in the mainland will go there to promote it.</p>
<p>Sports News</p>
<p>Talking about sports news, there are many newspapers in Taiwan, but there are no sports reports, because the reporters there have very poor Chinese language skills, and reporters from the mainland are not good at this type of reporting. He said that Mr. Lin Zongxian, a member of the Senate and a consultant of the association, will be the editor of the Sino-Foreign Daily, which is scheduled to be published in early February. The content will focus on sports, and he hopes to exchange it with newspapers in the mainland and provide assistance.</p>

<h3>This Year's Household Administration Supervision Implementation Measures: National Universal Implementation of Household Registration</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government has approved the telegram from the Ministry of Interior stating that the year 36 of the Republic is the year for the universal implementation of household registration, which was listed as the central task of the year by the President's handwritten order. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is difficult to achieve the schedule without strengthening supervision and assessment. Moreover, the national area is vast, so this method must be adopted. There are a total of 19 articles, which are formulated based on the Ministry of Interior's work plan for the 36th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>The central tasks for supervising household administration in the 36th year of the Republic are as follows: (1) Supervise various recovered areas to complete household registration; (2) Supervise areas with household registration to organize according to law; (3) Supervise areas without household registration to universally implement it; (4) Supervise areas with household registration to produce and issue national identification cards; (5) Supervise areas with household registration to transcribe the roster of able-bodied men and the national soldier roster; (6) Supervise areas with household registration to compile various household statistics tables.</p>

<h3>Amidst the Flames of Civil War: Raising a Serious Real-World Issue</h3>
<p>— Airmal from December 28th, Our Jinan Correspondent, Li Tian</p>
<p>Unless the Kuomintang and the Communist Party truly reconcile and cooperate, and the military becomes nationalized, the future trajectory of the civil war may see Shandong become a second Jiangxi after the Northern Expedition and before the War of Resistance, due to factors such as its terrain, resources, culture, and history. It will be the Communist army's strongest and also its last base. In the overall civil war situation, the gain or loss of Shandong is of decisive importance.</p>
<p>At the same time, it must be stated: The reporter writes this article not to propagandize or promote "anti-communism," but only to objectively analyze the possible future trends of the civil war, so as to help readers gain a deeper understanding of the domestic war situation.</p>
<p>Three Perspectives</p>
<p>When it comes to the domestic war, based on what this reporter has gleaned from Chinese and foreign generals, the views can be summarized into the following three categories: (1) Under the mediation of Marshall, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will eventually achieve peaceful cooperation, work together wholeheartedly to build a unified, democratic, prosperous, strong, and happy new China; (2) The Communist army will eventually be eliminated or disintegrated by the National army; (3) Although the war may ebb and flow, or the main force of the Communist army may be largely eliminated by the National army, it will not fundamentally and thoroughly annihilate the Communist army. The war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will only continue until a final reckoning after the outbreak of the Third World War.</p>
<p>Regarding the first view, those familiar with internal affairs mostly believe that it is, if not "fantasy," at least a "miracle." Regarding the second view, it depends on whether the government strives for progress in political affairs and whether its strategic application is thorough and appropriate. Regarding the third and final view, most people believe that it is the most likely outcome, but if we are truly forced to go down this road, our 400 million Chinese people will also encounter a fate that is difficult to fathom.</p>
<p>Strategic Importance</p>
<p>In the eyes of military observers, since the first possibility is considered almost a miracle, then whether the future domestic war takes the second or third path, Shandong's position in the domestic war situation deserves full recognition. In terms of military geography, Shandong is not only located in the center of the country, but the Shandong Peninsula extends deep into the sea, forming a strategic corner with the Liaodong Peninsula, with only a short voyage separating them. Therefore, Shandong is not only the lifeline of North China but also the only base for controlling the nine northeastern provinces. There is a reason and basis for the geographic expert Weng Wenhao's singular advocacy of establishing the capital in Jinan.</p>
<p>In addition to geographical factors, in terms of resources, Shandong's soybean production is second only to the Northeast in the country, cotton production is second only to Shaanxi, and wheat, rice, and miscellaneous grains are sufficient for the entire province's population with surplus. Underground resources such as coal and iron also rank third or fourth in the country. In terms of culture, "Yan and Zhao have many generous and tragic heroes." Shandong people have always been known for their hard work, resilience, heroism, integrity, trustworthiness, and righteousness, and they are physically strong and tall. As generals, they are often good generals, and as soldiers, they are good soldiers. Among the 38 million people, at least 5 million of the most outstanding soldiers can be produced. Even shallow and incompetent people like Liu Zhennian and Han Fuqu were able to occupy Shandong for so long, so the inherent advantages of Shandong itself can be imagined!</p>
<p>Furthermore, analyzing the history of the Communist army in Shandong and the advantages and disadvantages of their major bases in the country: Although northern Shaanxi is the heart of the Communist army, with the longest operation and the strongest military force, it is difficult for the Communist army to defend for a long time because of the poor land and people and being surrounded by enemies on all sides. The area north of the Songhua River in the Northeast, although easy to obtain foreign aid due to its remote location, has little effect on the overall domestic situation due to its overly peripheral location. In addition, since the base was only established after the victory of the War of Resistance, the time was short, and the foundation was not solid, it is also easy for the National army to attack and destroy it early. Other areas such as the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region, the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, the Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, and the northern Jiangsu Military Region are all strategically located in areas surrounded by enemies on all sides, and it is not difficult to pacify them. Only the Shandong Military Region is located in the heart of China. The Shandong Peninsula extends deep into the sea, and the Yimeng Mountains and Laoshan Mountains are continuous and undulating, with complex terrain. The Communist army claims to have operated for eight years, with deep-rooted foundations. In addition, Yantai and Longkou are only a waterway away from Lushun and Dalian, making it easy to obtain foreign aid. Therefore, Shandong has become the Communist army's most superior and potentially longest-held base, and Shandong's gain or loss has a decisive role in the overall domestic war situation.</p>
<p>Confrontational Situation</p>
<p>Shandong has a total of 107 counties, three ordinary cities, and one special municipality. As of the time this reporter is writing this article, 34 counties and one ordinary city (Jinan) and one special municipality (Qingdao) are completely in the hands of the National army. The remaining 15 counties are divided between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The area controlled by the government, in addition to the 14 counties in southern Shandong, is the 30-kilometer corridor along both sides of the Jiaoji Railway. The corridor area is naturally a vital area of concern for the Communist army. Therefore, in this day when it claims to have operated for eight years, possessing 1.2 million militiamen and 400,000 regular troops, it is still cautious and repeatedly expanding its army. Recently, it has expanded two more divisions. All men aged 16 to 50 and women aged 16 to 40 are being forcibly conscripted, which shows that the attempt to consolidate is not small.</p>
<p>At present, the government army is subject to the ceasefire order, and is in a passive position militarily everywhere, while the Communist army is deploying troops and generals, accumulating grass and storing grain, and carrying out deployments to attack the corridor area along the Jiaoji Line. The war in Shandong is expected to become fierce again with the arrival of the new year!</p>
<p>Where to Go</p>
<p>Regardless of how busy the Communist army is currently making deployments to attack the Jiaoji corridor in Shandong, Liu Bocheng, the highest commander of the Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, has moved to Dezhou, and Chen Yi, the commander of the New Fourth Army and the highest person in charge of the Shandong Military Region, has fled back from northern Jiangsu to Linyi (the highest command tower of the Shandong "Liberated Area"). In short, the Communist army's objective strength and potential are another matter, and its subjective demand is to hope to use Shandong as its strongest base to wait for favorable opportunities and situations to arrive.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation, when the remaining Communist army in northern Jiangsu is unable to gain a foothold, its largest rear base is Shandong. In the future, when the Communist army in the Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, the Ji-Cha Border Region, the Jin-Cha-Sui Border Region, the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, and even southern Northeast is unable to exist in their respective bases, they will all flee to Shandong and use Shandong as their last and largest base. At present, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu and the Ji-Lu-Yu area have begun to flow in this direction. In this way, will Shandong not become a second Jiangxi after the success of the Northern Expedition and before the rise of the War of Resistance?</p>
<p>The facts are before us: Shandong must be defended by the Communist army. If the government is forced to solve the domestic problem by force, should it first use its greatest strength to "attack what must be defended" and first solve the Communist army in Shandong? Or should it nurture a hidden danger and allow the Communist army to become strong in Shandong and truly evolve into a situation far more serious than Jiangxi? This question is related to the future of the country, and the burden falls on the shoulders of Chairman Wang Yaowu, a burden far heavier than that borne by General Fu Zuoyi in the past.</p>
<h3>Thousands of Miles Along the Huai and Si Rivers</h3>
<p>— Report from January 5th, Zhu Zhensheng</p>
<p>Between the Huai and Si Rivers and the Xuzhou and Haizhou areas, above the ancient Pei, Xiao, and Dang, from afar, like Han Gaozu rising from Feng and Pei, and Xiang Yu's ancestral home being in Suqian, and Han Xin growing up on the banks of the Huai River; closer, like Gu Zhutong and Han Deqin coming from Lianshui and Siyang; and Wang Maogong, Wang Jingjiu, and Wang Zhonglian being born in Xiao and Dang, they were either founding wise emperors and holy rulers, or loyal ministers and good generals who stabilized the country. However, in the Southern Song Dynasty and the late Qing Dynasty, Gao and Bao of the Jianghuai region first suffered the rebellion of Li Quan, a miscellaneous barbarian, and then the rebellion of Hong and Yang in the Su, Song, Chang, and Tai regions, causing the people to suffer and have no means of livelihood. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Jiangsu was the first to be invaded, with livestock being slaughtered and homes destroyed, and pillaging and burning being rampant. For nine years, it has suffered even more from the trampling of enemy and puppet forces. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, it was disturbed by the Communist Party and trapped in war, leaving the common people with no chance to catch their breath, and turning Jiangsu, known as a region of culture and civilization, into a hell on earth for a long time. The author participated in the war for eight years and has not set foot in northern Jiangsu for ten years. Recently, I accompanied Chairman Wang on a trip to the east, traversing eight counties and traveling thousands of miles, inspecting the Huai and Si areas. I will now write down what I have seen and heard:</p>
<p>On the Huaiyang Road</p>
<p>In a dawn when the morning stars were few and the cold dew was congealing into frost, I accompanied Chairman Wang and seven or eight senior officials from the provincial government across the Yangtze River from Zhenjiang. Looking around at Jinjiao and Beigu, they stood tall and majestic, and the waves were surging, as the great river flowed eastward. At about seven o'clock, we arrived at Liuwei and boarded three trucks prepared in advance, heading north. The sparse, decaying willows lined both sides, and the sounds of chickens and dogs could be heard. After passing the Fairy Temple, there were four or five large bridges, either due to disrepair or damage by the Communist army. Not long ago, a truck full of men, women, old, and young drove to the middle of a bridge, the bridge broke, and the truck fell, with forty-odd people all being drowned, and buried in the bellies of fish. Therefore, all vehicles now passing by must have all passengers disembark, leaving only the empty vehicle to pass, so as to avoid repeating the unfortunate tragedy. Upon entering Gaoyou County at Shaobo, the town was formerly occupied by the Communist army and was contested several times when the National army conquered it. Gaoyou Lake has tens of thousands of acres of waves, with water connecting the sky and the sky meeting the water. On both sides of the canal, sails dotted the landscape, with huts in clusters of three or five. Every few tens of miles along the lake, there is a market town, and small inland river boats have resumed navigation, loading and unloading goods and passengers along the way, the market is quite lively, and the countryside is gradually becoming prosperous. In the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations, in addition to military and political matters, the restoration of transportation is also one of the disputes. If transportation is not restored, then the restoration and construction of the country will all be equal to empty talk and cannot be started. When the car arrived at Gaoyou County, it was learned that Commander Xue Zhongshu of the 90th Brigade was moving his troops here, but unfortunately, due to the haste of the journey, we did not have time to meet. Crossing the boundary at Jieshou and entering Baoying Lake, the lake surface is smaller than Gaoyou Lake, and the car traveled in a winding path beside it. Looking from afar, it seemed like traveling in a water town. Both lakes produce fish and shellfish and are rich in water resources. The fields on all sides are irrigated. However, there are frequent floods, which are not as advantageous as Dongting and Poyang Lakes. At noon, we arrived at the Baoying County government, and learned that the county had received a district chief of the Communist Party's Luyi District, who had been wounded and captured in the second district of the county. Chairman Wang personally went to comfort him, and gave him 50,000 yuan in national currency, and instructed County Magistrate Shen to take good care of him. In addition, he instructed the county government to purchase medals, certificates, and a small number of practical items with 300,000 yuan in national currency to commend and comfort the families of the self-defense team members who died in the county, so that the living would be comforted and the dead would be at peace. Continuing on in the afternoon, the cars rolled on, and the horses neighed. At that time, the battles in Yancheng and Lianshui were in full swing, and military transport was frequent along the way. At dusk, we passed Huai'an, and entered the city of Huaiyin at dusk.</p>
<p>Huaiyin Urban Area</p>
<p>Huaiyin, also known as Qingjiangpu, is located on the Yin side of the Huai River and east of Hongze Lake, bordering Anhui. It was a key transportation route for grain in the past. In the Qing Dynasty, the Office of the Governor-General of Grain Transport was established, and in the early Republic of China, the Salt Commissioner of Lianghuai was established. Fifty years ago, the tall buildings and mansions along the river on the north gate stretched for ten miles. However, since the opening of sea transport and the construction of the Jinpu Railway, it has declined day by day and no longer has its former glory. Huaiyin and Huai'an. In the Han Dynasty, they were both called Huaiyin. Historical sites include Han Xin City, Limumu Tomb, and Luxia Bridge, which are preserved in both cities for later generations to look back on. In the autumn of the past year, the Japanese invaders surrendered, and the Communist army occupied it as the seat of the Su-Wan Border Region Government. Communist military and political figures, such as Li Yimang, chairman of the border region government, and Chen Yi, commander of the New Fourth Army, were stationed in Huai for a long time. On September 13th last year, Lieutenant General Zhang Lingfu of the 74th Reorganized Division, while attacking Siyang with the 7th Army, personally led the 51st, 57th, and 58th Brigades, dividing them into two columns, braving the rain to forcefully cross the old Yellow River. They studied and defeated the 9th Column's 2nd Division Pi Brigade and the Special Service Regiment Cavalry Regiment Guard Battalion, etc., commanded by the Communist army Chen Qingxian, numbering about 20,000. They then besieged the 5th Column and the 1st Division and 4th Division of the New 6th Army, which were reinforcing Huaiyin. On the 18th, Yang Jin, battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 172nd Regiment of our 58th Brigade, was the first to rush into the South Gate and joined up with the two companies that had broken in earlier. Although the Communist army executed three regimental commanders who had lost the battle during the fighting to encourage morale, they were still unable to reverse the decline. After seven days of bloody fighting and nine attacks, although our battalion commanders Liu Puyou and Zhu Xinglun heroically sacrificed their lives, Huaiyin was finally completely recovered by our National army at 2 p.m. on the 20th. 2,202 Communist soldiers were captured, and more than 10,000 were killed or wounded. 2,886 light and heavy machine guns and 69 large and small artillery pieces were seized. The main force of the Communist army was damaged and its vitality was greatly injured. Now, the Su-Wan Border Region Government has been used by us as the temporary office of the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Huaiyin, and the place where the Communist Party arranged to receive the Huaiyin Executive Group has also been temporarily used as the command post of Xu Zhou Pacification Headquarters Deputy Director Li Jifu - General Yannian. Other places such as the park, Xinhua Daily, and the National Assembly Hall have been rebuilt and transformed, but traces of the Communist Party can still be found. Before the war, the county of Huaiyin had a population of 700,000 to 800,000, and most of them have returned. Under the efforts of County Magistrate Huang Jiaju, county administration has gradually returned to normal. However, due to its strategic location, a curfew is imposed after 8 p.m., and the vigilance is strict, with the image of a tense wartime still present.</p>
<p>What I Saw and Heard in Suqian and Siyang</p>
<p>Once past Huaiyin, trees became sparse, and sandstorms swept across the face, resembling the scenery outside the Great Wall. Stepping into Suqian, the language, diet, habits, and gestures felt like the customs of Qi and Lu. Suqian is the hometown of Xiang Yu. In the past, the Overlord led 8,000 disciples and soldiers, rising in Jiangdong, fighting more than seventy battles, winning every battle and conquering every attack, shaking the four seas with his might. The Consort Yu of the drama "Farewell My Concubine" was from Wuji, Shuyang, his neighboring county. Heroes and beauties, even after thousands of years, are still praised by people. There are many stockades in northern Jiangsu, built with earth and surrounded by deep trenches, resembling earthen cities. Although the city of Suqian is not very majestic, the earthen city is quite strong. And General Wu Weisheng - Qiwei, Deputy Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, is stationed there to supervise the troops and block the Communist army's escape route. The streets are wide, the houses are neat, and the surface is still quite lively. However, it is said that after the Communist army's "struggles", the residents of the city and countryside are left with only the clothes on their backs, and five, six, seven, or eight people share a quilt. Siyang was ravaged by the enemy and puppet forces for nine years and destroyed several times by the Communist Party. The old city is a pile of rubble and has completely disappeared. Now the military and political organs and shops in Siyang have moved to Zhongxing Town. Chairman Wang has shown the administrative guidelines to the commissioners and county magistrates in Yang Zhou, Gao You, and Bao Ying. In Huaiyin, Suqian, and Siyang, he and Commissioner Yu Yuzhi of the 7th District separately convened responsible persons from various organs and local gentry and scholars to listen to reports and review county administration. He instructed officials at all levels that all administration should be based on what the people like and what the people hate, to cooperate with the military, to quickly restore order, and to ensure security. At the same time, he organized agricultural loans and industrial and commercial loans, promoted production, revived the countryside, and created schools to cultivate talents. What is taken from the people must be used for the people. At the same time, he encouraged the people of northern Jiangsu to contribute money if they have money and effort if they have strength, to protect the country and defend their hometowns, to seek long-term peace and stability for the country, and to seek a peaceful and prosperous life for themselves. Land policy should also be handled in accordance with the regulations of the central government, and in particular, extortion and blackmail should be avoided under the pretext of self-renewal and surrender of the Communist Party. He repeatedly exhorted, and his words were earnest and sincere. Chairman Wang is from Jiangsu. Although he is 56 years old, he is still vigorous and works diligently and loves the people, making us young people feel quite ashamed in addition to admiration!</p>
<p>Four Days in Yangtai</p>
<p>Throughout the newly recovered counties in northern Jiangsu, financial difficulties and tight administrative expenses are a common phenomenon. Economy is the mother of all administrations. If revenue and expenditure are insufficient, all matters that should be promoted and reformed cannot be carried out. However, governance lies in people. Counties, districts, townships, and bao are the grassroots of administration, but financial resources and talent are difficult to obtain, just like money. A large number of learned and talented people are concentrated in a small number of cities, while the vast countryside lacks talent and cadres. We must correct this top-heavy political malaise. Talent should be distributed to the countryside, to the fields! Yangtai is a city that has not been invaded by the Communist army. We stopped there briefly. We traveled to famous sites such as the clothes and crown tomb of Shi Kefa, the Ping Shan Tang, and Slender West Lake along with Director Wang Zuohua of the 4th Reorganized Division and Vice Director Rong Youlue. I was moved by the fact that at the end of the Chongzhen period, the rebel bandits Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng invaded the capital, and Wu Sangui brought in the Qing soldiers. Minister Shi was able to defend Yangzhou with his life as a lone minister at the end of the Ming Dynasty. "A few plum blossoms are tears for the fallen country, and the bright moon reflects the heart of a former minister." He could not be subdued by force, could not be corrupted by wealth, and committed suicide with the fall of the country, achieving immortality along with Zhang Suiyang and Wen Tianxiang. As for the so-called Twenty-Four Bridges, the scenery of the setting sun on the rolling grass and the prosperity of the Sui and Tang Dynasties can no longer be found. In the past, when the 83rd Reorganized Division was stationed in Taizhou, it was fiercely besieged by the Communist army, but fortunately, Director Li Tianxia bravely repelled them. Now, Major Generals Liang Bo and Chen Zhen of the 102nd Brigade are responsible for the city defense, and the security of the city is very peaceful. I once went on a trip to Jiangyan, a county rich in grain and rice, with Regiment Commander Chen Hongzhao and others. The canal was full of rice boats, the market was prosperous, and rice was only sold for more than 30,000 yuan per stone, and pork only cost 1,450 yuan per catty. The cost of living was several times lower than that of Shanghai, and it used to be the Communist army's granary in northern Jiangsu. Taixian has a reformatory that has collected nearly a thousand Communist prisoners. When Magistrate Ding accompanied us to visit, these prisoners were well-fed and warmly dressed, and they were doing exercises, living a very stable life. Some of the prisoners were being treated in the health center due to injuries. One prisoner, about 20 years old, said, "I was dragged away by the Communist army to serve as a stretcher bearer, and later I was transferred to be a soldier. The Communist army called the National army reactionaries, and their officials called instructors, and the soldiers called combatants. The soldiers' monthly salary was two catties of pork, and the company commander received an additional one and a half catties of pork. When fighting the National army, they had to flee east and west several times a day. His own parents did not know that he was forced to be a soldier, let alone that his son would be injured and lying on a hospital bed. He hoped that when he recovered from his injuries, he would be able to return to his hometown and see his parents again." Who has no parents? Who has no children? Driving innocent people into the fire of war and celebrating liberation and singing democracy, how can they justify themselves? The country has undergone eight years of war, creating great pain and trauma. We must strive for recovery and education, work hard to revitalize, and bury ourselves in construction. The melons of Huangtai cannot be picked again! How can we allow brothers to fight each other, and the heron and the clam to fight, plunging the country and the nation into an irreparable situation? Even if the Communist Party does not plan for the country and the nation, they should think about their own descendants. Why must they meet on the battlefield? National affairs can be discussed at length, carefully deliberated, and turned swords into silk, and hostility into peace. We must work together with one heart to seek recovery and build China into a prosperous and happy country.</p>

<h3>Xin Gang (New Harbor) Sluice – A Trial Voyage Record</h3>
<p>— Tianjin, 25th (Shipping News). Our Tianjin Correspondent, Li Shaolin</p>
<p>Under conditions of extremely difficult transportation in Jin-Gu (Tianjin area), the completion of the Xin Gang Sluice in Tanggu has opened a new chapter. Although the entire Tanggu Xin Gang project is far from complete, especially far from the ideal plan, the opening of the sluice is already a new achievement at Dagukou, and it is sufficient to provide great convenience for Jin-Gu transportation. From the start of the sluice's operation, the silt bar at the Haihe (Hai River) estuary is no longer an obstacle to navigation for incoming and outgoing vessels. Ships of 3,000 tons and even 10,000 tons can now enter the harbor from outside Dagukou via the 13-kilometer-long Xin Gang channel. Ships under 3,000 tons can also navigate directly to Tianjin via the sluice.</p>
<p>Taking Over – Utter Chaos</p>
<p>The original project authority for the Xin Gang construction was the Tanggu Xin Gang Engineering Office of the Ministry of Communications. It was reorganized this autumn into the Xin Gang Engineering Bureau. When the new port was first taken over, the sluice portion of the project was 80% complete. Extending from both sides of the sluice were the north and south breakwaters. The north breakwater was 12,750 meters long, but only 3,800 meters of the project were complete. The south breakwater was 16,800 meters long, with 5,000 meters completed and 4,500 meters half-completed. Between the two breakwaters was the 13-kilometer-long channel. In the Japanese plan, the section near the sluice was to be dredged to 6 meters below the Dagu zero point, and the section extending outward was to be dredged to 8 meters deep. Before the victory, this channel section had been dredged to 6 meters. Upon takeover, the plans had been burned, and some of the materials had been stolen or scattered, creating a scene of utter chaos.</p>
<p>The Engineering Bureau Completes the Sluice</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Xin Gang Engineering Bureau, the leaders focused on the urgent needs of Jin-Gu and devoted all efforts to completing the sluice. Construction began in October and was declared complete on December 13th. On December 15th, the Xin Gang Engineering Bureau held a trial voyage of the sluice. The reporter was invited to observe, and I felt immense joy in personally witnessing this new transformation of the Haihe estuary at Dagukou. Starting today, I am truly gratified. At 9:00 AM, I departed from Tianjin in the Xin Gang Engineering Bureau's shuttle car. It was a rare good day in the depths of winter. Although the Jin-Tang highway was under construction and the road surface was extremely uneven, causing the car to bump violently, this warm, windless morning gave me a sense of relaxation. Along the way, I saw frozen paddy fields, and some people were fishing from holes in the ice. The glistening ice surface reflected sunlight into my eyes. Village children, wearing large cotton shoes, were happily skating on the ice. From an aesthetic point of view, winter is also lovely. While taking in the endless winter scenery along the way, the two-hour journey to Xin Gang passed quickly.</p>
<p>The New Sluice, Man-Made</p>
<p>After arriving at the sluice, the trial voyage immediately began. The sluice is located on the north side of the Haihe estuary. The upper end of the sluice opens into the Haihe, and the lower end is connected to the entirely man-made 13-kilometer-long channel that extends directly into the sea. The sluice itself is 180 meters long, 21 meters wide, and 9.7 meters high. The bottom of the sluice is 5 meters below the Dagu zero point, with a depth of 5 meters at low tide and up to 8 meters at high tide. Each gate at both ends of the sluice weighs 180 tons and is equipped with air-filled floating boxes, which can reduce the weight by buoyancy to 140 tons. Therefore, the mass in the water is only 40 tons. Opening and closing are done entirely by electricity, taking about two minutes each time. All the machinery was originally ordered from Japan during the enemy puppet regime, but it was never delivered after the victory. The current machinery is temporarily pieced together. The control room is equipped with a 75-horsepower electric motor, although only 40 horsepower is actually needed to open and close the gates. The control panel is located on the north bank of the sluice. Because the machinery was assembled from various sources, the person in charge believed that there might be unreliable operation, so they are still searching for the set of machines originally ordered from Japan, preparing to replace them.</p>
<p>Glimpses of the Whole During the Trial Voyage</p>
<p>We stood on the third-floor platform of the control room to observe this trial voyage. From this vantage point, we could roughly see the entirety of Xin Gang. Looking from the top, the south breakwater on the south side of the gate was clearly visible. South of the breakwater was a vast expanse of water. Just outside the Haihe estuary lay the well-known Dagukou silt bar. The north breakwater was too far away to be seen at all, but the large tract of land artificially leveled on the north side of the channel could be seen very clearly. The first wharf, more than 90% complete, faced the Haihe. The river was full of white ice floes, winding like a white python curled up on the ground. The Jin Xing (Golden Star) test ship was moored in the Haihe outside the gate. At 11:20 AM, the upper gate was opened at the wave of a flag. The Jin Xing was then towed by a small tugboat from the Haihe into the gate. The gate was then closed. With the ship now inside the gate, it waited for the water level inside the gate to be adjusted to the level of the Dagu waterway. After 25 minutes, the lower gate opened, and the Jin Xing, still being pulled by the small tugboat, pushed aside the dense ice floes surrounding it and sailed out to sea. The trial voyage was successfully completed. From this point on, the Haihe and the waters of Dagu were united by this [sluice], beginning a new life.</p>
<p>Channel and Wharf Awaiting Processing</p>
<p>After the trial voyage, we were then led to visit the machine factory and the No. 1 wharf. The machine factory was divided into casting, riveting, fitter, and forging sections. The sluice gates were the masterpiece of this factory. The No. 1 wharf is 700 meters long and can simultaneously accommodate five to seven 3,000-ton ships. However, the depth is not yet ideal, currently only three meters deep, which causes many inconveniences for berthing 3,000-ton ships. During our visit, a dredging ship was working there. The ideal depth is six meters. As for the 13-kilometer-long channel, it had originally been dredged to six meters below the Dagu zero point. However, because the south breakwater has not been completed, silt still drifts in, and the banks of the channel have collapsed. According to measurements, it has been silted up by as much as 1.5 meters in the past year and urgently needs dredging. Repairing the wharves and dredging the channel are the main tasks of the Engineering Bureau in the next three years. The goal of this work is to enable Xin Gang to have a throughput of 2 million to 4 million tons per year. To this end, on the north side of the channel, outside the wharf, preparations are underway to dig two deep-water berths to accommodate 30,000-ton giant ships. In addition, the engineering staff has even more ideal long-term plans. However, building Xin Gang into a standard northern mega-port will require years. After the site visit, I was reminded of the original Japanese plan to give Xin Gang a throughput capacity of 27 million tons. It was an ideal, but an ideal of great significance.</p>

<h3>China's Blind Intestine – The Sufferings of the People in Eastern Henan – The Yellow River Flood Area – A Few Tragic Scenes</h3>
<p>The Yellow River, China's blind intestine, after the breach in the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], benefits the nation but harms the locality. For eight years, the Yellow River flood area in eastern Henan has been in deep water and fiery heat. The following scenes can tell readers how people in this area are living. In Xihua, we saw a group of women and children urgently awaiting rescue, expecting everything in the midst of hunger, cold, and piteous cries. (See Picture 1)</p>

<h3>Chinese Poetry in Europe – Switzerland is Best for Mountain Views; Only Holland is Best for Water Scenery</h3>
<p>— Holland, 1st January (Shipping News)</p>
<p>Two Chapters by Counselor Wang Jia Hong – Describing Events</p>
<p>The United Nations' efforts to promote new art and its funding of the great achievement of translating poetry into Western languages are a heaven-sent literary movement that has broken the silence of the ideological world throughout history. It is expected that the beautiful scenery of Europe and America will be sung by Chinese poets in the future, and the joy will be overwhelming. Of all the countries in Europe, Switzerland is the best for mountain views, and Holland is the best for water scenery. In the past, the world did not value culture and education, so Western things could not be celebrated together using the most beautiful Chinese characters, which was regrettable. But now it is different. The natural beauty of Switzerland is known to all in the world.</p>
<p>The poems of my country praising Switzerland that are worth reciting include the two chapters by Counselor Wang Jia Hong of the Swiss Embassy, describing his roaming among the mountains and waters. The first says: "Regardless of what year it is today, I think of Wu Huai and Ge Tian. I walk along the stream, forgetting how far I've gone. Leaning on the railing, I listen to the flute, loving the idle clouds. Mixed flowers bloom and fall after the rain. An old man fishes and sleeps when tired. There are other water-playing female companions, their slender waists competing with the beauty of willow branches." The second says: "Walking to where mountains overlap and rivers wind, I see flowers and willows in colorful profusion. The water is as clear as a bright mirror, and the mountains have strange peaks surpassing Mount Xia. My thoughts drift far away with dreams, and fairy music floats from across the stream. Comparing it to the three parts of the moon tonight, Yangzhou may not even account for two."</p>
<p>Poet Saint Huang Yunzhi – Passing Lake Geneva</p>
<p>Reading the poems of Huang Yunzhi, a talented scholar from the highest institution of learning in Beiping, when he traveled in Switzerland, his wonderful thoughts were inspired by heaven, making him even more of a poetry saint abroad. His five-character律詩 (lüshi) "Autumn Day Passing Lake Geneva (Lac Lemen)" says: "The crowd is not surprised by the falling leaves, the west wind shakes my heart, continuing clouds cut off the layers of green, hooked moon penetrates sparse danger, heaven and man are both quiet, following the dream turns deep, the cold waters of Lake Geneva, the waves are fine, and the birds float steadily." And his "Miscellaneous Verses on a Suburban Trip to Switzerland" says: "The vast clear sky is covered by a thin mist, distant snow reflects silver sand, heaven's heart cannot bear the autumn decline, dyeing the frost forest, tree after tree, flowers." The second says: "Torrential rapids flow from high cliffs, the aura of the depths of the springs is even more beautiful, the bright moon comes out after people have left, the pine waves play a secluded melody year after year." The third says: "Crimson and white flowers vying for the splendor of spring surround the fence, farmers and children cheer, I now believe that there are many beautiful scenes in times of peace, melons ripen in the fields, shining like rosy clouds." The fourth says! "The scenery is different, myriad phenomena open, after the homeland's catastrophe, there is wasteland, cloud trees fill the sky in staggered shadows, it seems as if sorrowful swans are chased by the eyes."</p>
<p>The four poems express concern for the people and love for the country, with extraordinary sentiments. The last two lines of the second poem are filled with other worldly joy and are exceptionally unique, and supremely wonderful.</p>
<p>Invited by Queen of Holland – Visiting Het Loo Palace</p>
<p>The extraordinary and sacred scenery of the Netherlands is perhaps not fully known by we Chinese, so I specially record new and old works to provide guidance. In the autumn of the year Xīn wèi (1931), in the ninth month, invited by the Dutch Queen's petite palace, I met with Her Majesty Queen Wilhelmina at Het Loo Palace. On a journey into the forest roads and a suburban tour, I recorded the victory: "The vast new machine surges, the ancient palace is autumnal with wind and clouds, six armies divide the trees along the road, a hundred steps look towards the immortal tower, the beauty of the clear light is faint, the green shadows flow throughout the courtyard, the grand scale is beautiful, the evening smoke is softly sad."</p>
<p>Outside the palace gate, the avenue shows the marks of carriage wheels, bounded by long forests, with six parallel roads. Along the roads are huge houses, with towering buildings facing each other, always separated by gardens about a hundred steps apart, resembling the magnificent scenery of famous American cities. Recalling my youth traveling in the New World, my heart is always saddened, without knowing why. On the evening of the 23rd of June, after the rain at 9 PM, I strolled with Zhao Shi to the Green Waste Road above the former fort, looking south at the prairie, and obtained the lines: "Low-lying tiles cover the overlapping terraces, secluded searches reveal the village of my lodging, all the flowers are exquisite, even trees are lush and dense, the language of the alleys is like pearls and jade, the scenery is warm, the heart is idle, the wilderness is pure, I sit and whistle at the green gate."</p>
<p>Returning south from Zwolle to the River Ferry, incidents while on the military train: "Long forests and deep waters record Langhuan, looking towards the river city, going and returning again, new greenery, slanting sun, the wilderness is vast, white clouds, low grass, cattle and horses idle, swimming and getting wet, why worry about drowning, happily letting the wind pass without closing the gates, a peaceful and leisurely place, discussing the way out "to the people"."

<h3>OK Sugar Invented – Dutch Scientists Bring New Sweetness</h3>
<p>— Leiden, 1st January (Shipping News). Our Special Correspondent Wang Ren</p>
<p>Sugar is a special product of tropical regions. During the two World Wars, the people of Europe, who love sweets, suffered from a shortage of sugar. This is a very big flaw in modern material civilization that human power cannot easily fill.</p>
<p>Professor van der Weijden of the Netherlands invented a kind of dark brown sweetness before the Second European War. Recently, Van der Kade, a Dutch scientist studying in the United States, improved it and obtained two kinds of qualities: orange-yellow and red. The orange-yellow quality is commercially named O.K. sugar. (Note: The two words O.K. in American promises originally meant Order of the King, that is, a royal order.) It has four characteristics: (1) It is four thousand times sweeter than cane sugar. (2) There is no sweetness after eating. (3) It does not have the strange taste of substitute sugar (saccharin) (written as 副味 in Western languages). (4) The chemical composition is quite simple, easy to manufacture, and does not require special machines.</p>
<p>At a time when the whole world needs sugar, if a country can attack more "OK sugar", on the one hand, it can meet the urgent needs of its own people, and on the other hand, it can share the surplus, sell it to foreign countries, and exchange it for large amounts of foreign exchange, and then benefit the national economy and people's livelihood, which is a win-win strategy.</p>

<h3>New Year's Hopes and Doubts – The Eightieth US Congress Opens!</h3>
<p>— Chu Yukun</p>
<p>This week is the beginning of the year 1947. Looking back and forward, I always feel that 1947 has unlimited hope. Everyone knows that what the people of the world have been eagerly longing for day and night after the war is the realization of "peace" and "democracy." Therefore, our hope for 1947 is to hope that 1947 will become a real "year of peace and democracy."</p>
<p>The "Year of Peace and Democracy" has already passed its first week. In these seven days, we have seen the Chinese National Government promulgate a new constitution, the United States declare the end of the state of war, British Army Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union, the upcoming resumption of the London Palestine Conference, the imminent election of the French president, and other news. At the same time, we have heard the New Year's messages issued by heads of state and leaders from all walks of life, all of whom expressed considerable optimism about 1947.</p>
<p>Thirteen Questions About the Future</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, international counter-currents are still surging, and it is difficult to be overly optimistic about the hopes for the new year. People in the United States who are concerned about international politics have raised thirteen questions at the beginning of the year. They are indeed worthy of our deep consideration: (1) Will the United States lose peace? Or will it steal peace? (2) Will the Soviet Union faithfully strive for "one world"? Or will it allow the world to be divided into two? (3) In what posture will Germany reappear in the ruins of the Third Reich? (4) Will Japan be a peaceful element in the Pacific? Will Korea be a battlefield for ideological struggle? (5) Will China be unified? Or will it continue the civil war? (6) Colonial conflicts are spreading, is there a solution? (7) Can the Balkan problem be solved? What action will the Soviet Union take on the Turkish Straits? (8) Will the Middle East's oil catch fire and burn? Or can it be used for peace? (9) What will happen in Palestine? (10) Will the United Nations' handling of the Franco problem in Spain succeed? Or will it fail? (11) Will the famous countries of Latin America unite? Will Argentine President Colonel Perón establish a fascist regime? (12) Can the Antarctic competition between countries be limited to scientific competition? (13) Will Admiral Byrd's Antarctic exploration be a prelude to the international competition for tin mines?</p>
<p>US Congress Opens</p>
<p>The Eightieth Congress of the United States opened on the 3rd. The Republican Party, which had been in opposition for fifteen years, regained control of Congress. First, it elected Republican Congressman Martin as Speaker of the House of Representatives, who was immediately sworn in and gave a speech, saying: "The current system in the United States has made the United States the greatest country in history. The United States government has no room for those who are biased towards the communist system." During Speaker Martin's speech, the applause of the members of Congress was endless. The US House of Representatives is full of anti-communism and anti-President Roosevelt sentiments, which can also be seen in general. At the same time, the Senate also elected Republican Senator Vandenberg as President Pro Tempore. Because of the bribery case of Democratic Senator Bilbo, it was closed for two or three days, which really made the Eightieth Congress of the United States riot.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, President Truman submitted a message to the Eightieth Congress, reporting on the future policy guidelines, and he could only appeal to the Republican and Democratic parties to cooperate.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Post-War Germany – Communism Gradually Loses Ground</h3>
<p>— Written by Arnold, United Press Correspondent. Translated by An Fu</p>
<p>One year and seven months after Hitler's collapse, Germany remains a political mystery in Europe.</p>
<p>However, the elections in Berlin and the four occupation zones in the past three months have cleared up the chaotic political scene, enabling those who are interested in studying post-war German politics to obtain two broad conclusions as follows:</p>
<p>1. Communism, supported by the Soviet occupying forces, has gradually lost ground.</p>
<p>2. If a free and democratic election were held in the entire Germany tomorrow, then the Christian Democratic Party (called the Christian Socialist Alliance in southern Germany) would probably be expected to win the final victory.</p>
<p>These observers believe that in a direct popular election, the first president of the first government of post-war Germany will be the tall and thin Jacob Kaiser, who is the leader of the so-called "left wing" of the Christian Democratic Alliance, 58 years old, and whose headquarters will be located in Berlin.</p>
<p>Many Allied observers now admit – and many Germans will agree – that the Christian Democrats are so popular partly because they have not yet become a "test balloon" for any of the occupying powers.</p>
<p>Today, to regard Germany as a political unit is like trying to connect the internal politics of the Soviet Union, France, the United States, and Britain.</p>
<p>The three western occupation zones, along with the four major parties (Christian Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party, Communist Party, and Liberal Democratic Party), are in fact still isolated from eastern Germany, which is controlled by the Soviet army. Only three parties (the Communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party) are recognized in eastern Germany.</p>
<p>The entire political structure can be said to be "artificial," because these parties themselves were born under the approval of the Allied countries and are only allowed to grow with the protection of the Allied countries.</p>
<p>The two political stages in Germany today revolve around the four major parties. These four parties are the Communist Party (i.e., the Socialist Unity Party) in the Soviet occupation zone and Berlin, which was formed by the merger of the Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party this spring; the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
<p>In addition, there are smaller "opposition parties" and "ax-grinding parties," but their suffrage is very limited, so their importance in the entire political landscape is also very small.</p>
<p>Today's Communist Party (or Socialist Unity Party), dating back to the pre-Hitler era, represents the old German Communist Party, with strong Soviet communist traits. The German Communist Party, like the Soviet Communist Party, represents the totalitarian party control and class consciousness.</p>
<p>Their party doctrine focuses on liberating the oppressed, consolidating the unity of the working class, and using a strong central government to unify Germany.</p>
<p>Their leaders are selected from German communists trained in Moscow, such as Wilhelm Pieck, who narrowly escaped death in Hitler's purges, and Walter Ulbricht, who returned to Germany with the Soviet army.</p>
<p>Recently retired were the leaders of the left-wing Socialist Party, Ottl Grotoworl and his agent Max FOchner, who allowed the joint organization of the Socialist Unity Party or "mixed" party with the Communist Party.</p>
<p>The Social Democratic Party also encountered Hitler's purge. Although its leaders are weak, it has laid a great foundation in Berlin with a fierce anti-communist program.</p>
<p>In the western occupation zone, their great German leader is Dr. Kurt Schumacher, a one-armed politician who strives to combine Marxist socialism into a modern economic picture and emphasizes British-style "nationalism."</p>
<h3>Many Strange Things in Washington: Truman's Name Missing from the White House Payroll, the President Receiving Money from a Woman Makes One More Confused the More One Thinks About It</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ye Yunlan from the Saturday Evening Post</p>
<p>Many strange things happen in Washington; one of which is that the name of the President of the United States has never appeared on the White House payroll. In fact, the President's name is never on any payroll. Once a month, in official terms, he must "request" the government to disburse one-twelfth of his $75,000 annual salary, approved by Congress. However, not a penny less, President Truman always receives his money promptly on the first of each month.</p>
<p>When high-ranking civil servants in the White House, Treasury Department, and General Accounting Office are asked about this puzzling fact and requested to explain it, they invariably shake their gray heads helplessly.</p>
<p>Like any other salaried American, Mr. Truman must pay income tax to the government. Therefore, $1,147.60 must be deducted from his salary, leaving him with $5,102.40. However, his total tax liability is more than that. It is estimated that the President pays a total of $46,000 in federal taxes each year, plus an additional $1,000 in Missouri state taxes, leaving him with a net income of only $28,000. In addition to his regular salary, the President receives an annual expense allowance of $25,000 for travel and other expenses.</p>
<p>The approval certificate is the beginning of the President's complicated salary payment process. According to official protocol, this certificate must be transferred to Woodson, the chief of the Auditing Section of the Accounting Division of the Treasury Department, for rigorous review and approval. The audited payment order and approval certificate are then sent to the office of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p>At this point, the document falls into the hands of Mrs. Pallas, a middle-aged woman whose official title is "Special Assistant to the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury." A check for $5,102.40, made out to Harry Truman, requires her signature, "B.R. Pallas," before it can be cashed.</p>
<p>After President Truman endorses the check and the bank pays it, it is returned to the General Accounting Office, where it is filed. The office's archives are a legendary collection of autographs, which, if sold, would be worth millions of dollars. These documents show that Washington never received a salary; instead, he was paid piecemeal, with amounts ranging from $200 to $1,300, totaling only $25,000. The current complicated procedure for the President's monthly salary payments began around the time of Jefferson's re-election. His monthly salary was $2,083.33, and after working a full year, he had to add an extra four cents to receive the full $25,000.</p>
<p>Given today's high cost of living, Washington and Jefferson's salaries were, in effect, much higher than Truman's.</p>
<h3>The American President Takes Money From Her</h3>
<h3>Nazi Scientists Continue Research Work in America</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xu Shangjun from Life Weekly</p>
<p>Even before the end of the war on the European continent, some of Hitler's most valuable scientific workers quietly disappeared from German soil. These scientists, who had helped their country surpass the Allied nations in guided missiles, supersonics, aerodynamics, and ballistics, were immediately sent to the countries that had been their enemies. The Allied nations sometimes had to cooperate and sometimes compete in a "brain hunt" to acquire these spoils of war. In this competition, the United States was clearly the victor. Last month (December of last year), the Department of the Army announced that many of these scientists were routinely engaged in research and design work in the United States.</p>
<p>The first-line advancing troops of the United States had specially assigned officers to search for and recruit key figures among German scientists and industrialists. They did not find this work difficult. Although scientists were being sought by countries all over the world, most of them were willing to accept, even eager for, an invitation from the United States. Very quickly and secretly, Germany's most outstanding minds and priceless research results were transported across the Atlantic. There, U.S. Army personnel were waiting to greet them at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio and Fort Bliss in Texas; later, some were escorted to the U.S. rocket artillery test site at White Sands, New Mexico. There, these scientists immediately set up workshops to study certain problems that the Army had not been able to solve. To this day, these Germans have fully demonstrated a spirit of cooperation and have not concealed anything in response to countless inquiries from American experts.</p>
<p>The Nazi scientists are nominally "non-military employees of the European Theater of Operations of the U.S. Army, temporarily serving in the United States." In fact, they only have short-term contracts with the Army, which the military can change at any time. They live in Army barracks, eat Army rations, receive a daily living allowance of six U.S. dollars, and a small salary is paid to their families remaining in Europe. They are not considered prisoners of war and are free to leave the barracks outside of working hours. Excellent scientists can look forward to receiving full salaries and even obtaining U.S. citizenship. At that time, their entire families can be brought to the United States to reunite. Very few of these scientists want to return to Germany.</p>
<p>Some Nazi scientists narrowly escaped from Germany. Franz, the research director of the Junkers aircraft factory in Dessau, and his assistants discussed the matter in detail and decided that going to the West would be the best course of action. Shortly before the arrival of the Russian army, they retreated with the Americans. Dr. Wernher von Braun, director of the V-2 weapons research program in Peenemünde, and his main assistants, carrying all the documents they could get their hands on, fled to the American lines. Many scientists gladly followed Hitler's call to move to Neuburg in Bavaria because they knew they would meet the Americans there. Although other countries were also eagerly pursuing the cream of German science and occasionally succeeded, the United States has obtained almost everything it wanted. The reason for this is that the German scientists' love for America was the greatest, and their fear of her was the smallest.</p>
<h3>United Nations Headquarters: Manhattan Merchants Unwilling to Relocate</h3>
<p>The small business owners gathered on the east side of Manhattan are unwilling to move, even for the United Nations to establish its headquarters there.</p>
<p>"I've been here for sixteen years," said Anna Guiskineski, leaning against the counter of her small grocery store. "My life is good, and now they want me to move."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll tell them: Give me compensation, give me good compensation. That Rockefeller is very rich. If they give me adequate compensation, then maybe I'll be willing to move."</p>
<p>This is an area of six buildings that Rockefeller plans to purchase for $8.5 million and then donate to the United Nations. The area is on the East River, between 42nd and 48th Streets, and is almost entirely a commercial and industrial district.</p>
<p>"We don't live here, but we like this place," said McCarthy, a gray-haired manager of a paint company. "We make a living here, after all, and we've been here for twenty years."</p>
<p>McCarthy said he didn't know where to find another place.</p>
<p>He said, "If they were planning to build some houses for veterans, then I wouldn't mind. But I don't understand why we have to move for the United Nations."</p>
<p>Across the street, Harry Gaisin watched his 23-year-old son, Leonard, working on a set of tires.</p>
<p>"He just got out of the army," said Gaisin. "I've been in this building for fourteen years. I raised Leonard and made him my manager. Now, what? If the United Nations takes over this place, we'll have to move. Where to? I don't know. I really don't know what to do."</p>
<h3>The Age of the Earth: 2.99 Billion Years</h3>
<p>— Translated by An Fu from Reader's Digest</p>
<p>How old is the Earth we live on? Finally, we have an answer. The famous Scottish geologist Dr. Arthur Holmes has announced the age of our planet. Based on precise facts from atomic physics, Dr. Holmes has realized a long-cherished hope of "measuring the depth of geological time." His outstanding research is very moving because the results show that our world is about twice as old as anyone previously believed. Dr. Holmes has not traced the origin of the Earth—on which science is still uncertain—but only the time of formation of the original rocks. He states that our planet is as much as 2.99 billion years old.</p>
<p>Research Base</p>
<p>But what is the basis of his research? This basis is "pure science" and has no obvious practical value. But those who scoff should remember that when Leeuwenhoek used the first microscope to show that a drop of drinking water contained thousands of microorganisms, he was also ridiculed. For almost two hundred years, practical people did not understand what it meant to study this tiny world (microorganisms)—until Pasteur proved that bacteria took more lives than all the wars in history combined. This lesson asks us to take Dr. Holmes's astonishing figures seriously, because this professor from Edinburgh has accomplished a feat of scientific skill.</p>
<p>As early as 1650, Bishop Ussher concluded from biblical arguments that the Earth was 5,654 years old. Soon after him, early geologists greatly extended the age of the world. At the beginning of our century, the great physicist Kelvin, ignoring geological evidence, insisted that the Earth was no more than 27 million years old. But soon after, the discovery of the "clock" overturned every previous calculation.</p>
<p>But let's first look at when humans appeared on Earth. Archaeological facts firmly prove that Neolithic humans arrived in Western Europe 10,000 years ago. Further examining human bones and tools buried underground, we find that humans appeared 30,000 years ago. And the Hominidae, including us humans and other now-extinct human-like creatures, evolved from non-human ancestors as far back as 3.33 million years ago.</p>
<p>Of course, geologists know that other animals, plants, and rocks have existed for even longer. Consider the ocean. Only twelve parts in 100,000 parts of seawater are chalk. Yet 48 million square miles of the ocean floor are thickly covered with chalky ooze, and this ooze is made up of the corpses of tiny organisms in the ocean. These animals need hundreds of millions of years to cover such a vast seabed with their skeletons.</p>
<p>From fossils and coal seams, volcanoes and canyons, science had compiled a large number of books by 1900, proving conclusively that the Earth was at least 200 million years old.</p>
<p>Geological Revolution</p>
<p>Marie and Pierre Curie completed the geological revolution. Their discovery of radium showed that the Earth was much older than Kelvin had imagined because radioactive elements like radium were constantly supplying heat to our planet in ways that no one had previously suspected. But more importantly, radium and uranium provided geologists with a very accurate "clock" to measure past time.</p>
<p>We must understand how these atomic clocks work. First, accurate laboratory tests show that one ounce of radium will disappear by half in only 1,580 years. One ounce of uranium must pass 4.5 billion years before disappearing by half. The remaining half ounce will disappear by half again after another 4.5 billion years, leaving only a quarter of an ounce, and so on. Physics can detect uranium atoms in extremely small quantities and measure the products of their intermediate and final decay. So, when we find these substances in rocks, we can accurately say how long the rocks have existed. Therefore, Curie's research allowed Professor Rayleigh to say in 1921 that life on Earth probably existed 1 billion years ago.</p>
<p>But there was still a serious gap in our knowledge. What was the situation before the radioactive changes began in the rocks we now know? This seemed to be an unsolvable mystery.</p>
<p>In 1938, Dr. Nier published figures on lead ores in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, which were sent to him from lead mines around the world. Arthur Holmes, a scientist from Edinburgh, saw an opportunity in these statistics to solve the oldest mystery.</p>
<p>Detective Story</p>
<p>But it took him two years to find the assistant he needed. That was a computer. Without this computer, the old professor might have spent a million years solving the various equations! Even with the help of this machine, the work of uncovering every clue was very laborious.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can temporarily put aside the mathematics involved and still follow this amazing detective story. Here is a "headless case" enough to test your thinking ability in many clues.</p>
<p>The basic facts are very important. At the beginning, there are four chemical witnesses: four different metals, lead. That is "normal" lead (204) and its three isotopes (206, 207, 208). These three isotopes are produced during the decay of radioactive elements. Lead 208 is formed by the decomposition of thorium atoms, while 206 and 207 come from uranium. So these leads were all formed on the surface of our Earth's rocks after the world began.</p>
<p>But lead 204 is not formed from any other element. So Dr. Holmes calls it "primordial lead." It came into being with the Earth becoming solid. Geological facts tell us how the isotopes were formed. Countless generations ago, when primordial lead gradually gathered to form lead ore, it passed through the rocks of the vast crust, rocks containing enough uranium and thorium to produce isotopic lead.</p>
<p>Dr. Holmes spent four years finally solving a kind of algebraic equation. The answer he got was that the time that has passed from the formation of the primordial rock to the present is about 2.99 billion years.</p>

<h3>Gold Island</h3>
<p>— Shao Fu</p>
<p>Yesterday's Hong Kong dispatch reported on Hong Kong's recent recovery and prosperity. For example, the cars in front of the Peninsula Hotel are lined up again, and the Hong Kong-Kowloon ferries, even those carrying cars from Yau Ma Tei, are shuttling back and forth. The two large bronze lions in front of HSBC have also been shipped back from Japan and are sitting securely on their original stone bases. Most surprising is that the lottery tickets for the drawing on the 14th of this month sold over 300,000 a week in advance. Wealthy people are flocking in, and floating capital is concentrated, making Hong Kong fat and prosperous.</p>
<p>Those who lived in Hong Kong before the victory can deeply understand the policies and intentions of the Hong Kong government in managing this small island. The situation after the victory today should not have changed. However, at that time, our country was at war, and we had no choice but to use Hong Kong as a liaison station. The situation is completely different today. We have no need to escape to Hong Kong, especially when people are in Shanghai but their money is going to Hong Kong. I really don't know what they are thinking. Ah, the island of gold! Yet the Shenzhen blood case happened, and the incident of kicking a vendor to death happened. And what are the results of these two cases? Doesn't this give me some enlightenment?</p>
<h3>New Fog-Clearing Weapon: FIDO</h3>
<p>— Abridged and Translated by Sun Zupei from the English-Language Great American Evening News</p>
<p>Fog has become a major threat to civil aviation worldwide, and the recent series of flight disasters have been mainly due to fog. From the Associated Press report below, we can see how the United States is fighting fog.</p>
<p>At Arcata Airport in California, there was recently a demonstration showing post-war progress in fog dispersal. In the demonstration, we saw for the first time the application of the new fog-clearing weapon "FIDO"—burning a hole 700 feet long, 300 feet wide, and 600 feet high in the thick fog in two minutes. An aircraft carrying reporters and observers made eight successful approaches to the runway, although the visibility outside the clear area was only about 500 feet.</p>
<p>"FIDO" was first used in Britain in 1942 by Anglo-American bombers. At that time, they often had to fly to Germany in thick fog and had to have this equipment. At that time, they burned large amounts of aviation gasoline along the runway to achieve the purpose of fog dispersal.</p>
<p>Releasing Dense Fog</p>
<p>The new "FIDO" uses diesel as fuel, which is cheaper than gasoline and has twice the heat energy of the same amount of gasoline; that is, diesel is twice as efficient as gasoline, but diesel requires high pressure and a carburetor. Under 1,750 pounds of pressure, vaporized diesel fuel spews out fiery, smokeless flames from hundreds of injectors, illuminating the surrounding area as brightly as a forest fire. In this intense heat, the fog evaporates quickly, and the outline of the runway is unusually clear with the help of the roaring flames and other lights.</p>
<p>However, "FIDO" also needs the help of ordinary radio, which keeps the aircraft's flight direction consistent with the runway direction and maintains an appropriate downward angle, allowing the aircraft to approach the runway. Recent experiments have also involved burning the flames into a "light groove" of varying sizes, with the smaller end at the beginning of the runway and the larger end two miles beyond the runway beginning. In this way, the driver only needs to drive the plane down this "light groove" to enter the fog hole burned by "FIDO" and clearly see everything at the airport.</p>
<p>American Research</p>
<p>In order to establish knowledge about fog dispersal and other auxiliary landing equipment so that various military and civilian aircraft can fly on schedule regardless of the weather, almost all aviation-related organizations in the United States are participating in fog dispersal research. The Navy, Army, Department of Civil Aeronautics, Civil Aeronautics Administration, Air Transport Association, and Pilots Association have all signed contracts with Arcata Airport to conduct research.</p>
<p>As to why the research site was chosen in remote Northern California, it is because of the foggy conditions and proximity to oil sources. The supply of oil is a major issue in the application of "FIDO." When all the fog-clearing flames at the entire airport are burning at their most intense, it takes three cars worth of gasoline and diesel per hour. Even the new high-pressure "FIDO" requires two cars' worth of diesel fuel per hour, or 25,000 gallons, costing more than $25 per minute.</p>
<p>In the early days of the war in Britain, it cost $5,000 worth of gasoline for a bomber to land. After several improvements, it has now been reduced to $50. For passenger planes stranded by fog, $1 per minute is still a reasonable price. But for small planes, the cost seems too high.</p>

<h3>What World is This?</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamu</p>
<p>Limbs Cut Off and Legs Broken for a Bowl of Rice</p>
<p>Today, people of all classes in society mostly feel the inconvenience of almsgiving. Moreover, the number of beggars is so large that it is impossible to give to everyone, so people's hearts gradually harden. When beggars come to the door or you encounter begging on the street, they are ignored. It is difficult to find even one person in ten willing to give money. This phenomenon has become a very obvious fact, and the hardships of the beggar's life can be imagined.</p>
<p>But the income of disabled beggars is an exception. People are generally more easily moved by beggars with severed hands and feet and blind eyes, especially benevolent grandmothers and ladies, who are most able to empathize with the suffering of beggars. The disabled class of beggars has become the aristocracy of the begging world, causing the gaze and envy of ordinary beggars.</p>
<p>The reason for the disability of beggars is either congenital heredity, or excessive labor of the mother, or carelessness during childbirth, or lack of care as an infant, or injuries such as falls during childhood, which naturally lead to disability. What is considered an unfortunate encounter by ordinary people is actually regarded as a treasure by people in the poverty-stricken beggar world. Because they can use it to practice their "street yelling" career, in their lifetime, they can beg for more money, earning tens of times more than ordinary non-disabled beggars, which makes other beggars jealous.</p>
<p>Influenced by the above facts, the parents of beggars hope that their children will all be born disabled, but often, things do not go as they wish. In this helplessness, they even heartlessly make their children disabled. In childhood, they harden their hearts and cut off part of their limbs or blind their eyes. The most ruthless and inhumane thing is that in infancy, they use various instruments to restrict part or several parts of their limbs, preventing them from developing at the same time as the whole body. When they grow up, they become disabled. Then they are allowed to join the beggar gang to yell on the streets, so they can earn more money for the family.</p>
<p>In many rural areas, because production has completely stopped, people's minds are closed, and they are extremely poor, so customs gradually become barbaric. People growing up there have absolutely no way to find employment, naturally no skills or ideas for employment, and no opportunity for education. The only way out is to live the beggar's life of "touching the gun and begging for money."</p>
<p>This evil custom of artificially creating disabilities is constantly流行流行的 in extremely poor and desolate areas. Especially on the north bank of the Yangtze River, it is simply commonplace and nothing to be surprised about. If readers observe carefully, they will surely find many disabled beggars in this city and many towns they have been to. I have repeatedly seen beggars with amputated limbs in Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places, rolling in the muddy roads of the鬧市鬧市 downtown area, practicing their touching-the-gun beggar gang's "flipping the tai sui" street-yelling life. What world is this, that such tragic things can happen?</p>
<h3>Current Events Q&amp;A: Ten Questions and Answers for 1947</h3>
<p>— Answered by Jia Nan</p>
<p>As we usher in the new year, everyone is filled with anticipation for a year better than the last. However, according to dispatches from the French News Agency, Washington insiders believe that there are thirteen major questions looming on the political horizon this year that remain unresolved. I will now transcribe ten of the more interesting ones and offer speculative answers. Whether these answers are correct remains to be seen.</p>
<p>(1) Will the United States obtain peace, or will it lose peace?</p>
<p>Answer: In all matters, great or small, to achieve a goal, one must combine both soft and hard approaches, both rigidity and flexibility. Currently, the only country that seems capable of hindering the United States' efforts to achieve peace is the Soviet Union. If the United States can truly establish a fair and impartial political program, with no selfish elements mixed in, and simultaneously back it up with sufficient strength, then the United States will certainly win peace.</p>
<p>(2) Will the Soviet Union strive for "One World," or will it allow the world to be divided?</p>
<p>Answer: The Soviet Union has its own unique interpretation of the concept of "One World." From the Soviet Union's perspective, it can truly be said that it is constantly striving for "One World." However, from the perspective of other countries, this might actually be an attempt to divide the world. The theory of relativity seems applicable here as well.</p>
<p>(3) From the ruins of the "Third German Republic," in what form will Germany reappear?</p>
<p>Answer: There are three possibilities for Germany's political future: (A) unification of the four occupied zones and establishment of a central government; (B) continuation of the current fragmented state; (C) establishment of a federal government with weak central power and strong local power. Considering the domestic and international situation in Germany, the third possibility is most likely to become reality.</p>
<p>(4) Will Japan become a peaceful member in the Pacific region? Will Korea become a battleground for ideological struggle?</p>
<p>Answer: Speaking from the perspective of the Chinese people, who have suffered the most from Japanese aggression, we must express extreme reservations about whether Japan can become a peaceful member in the Pacific region and should remain vigilant at all times. As for Korea, it is the only place besides Germany where the United States and the Soviet Union have direct land contact. Armed conflict may not necessarily occur, but ideological struggle is unavoidable.</p>
<p>(5) Colonial conflicts are spreading; is there a solution?</p>
<p>Answer: Colonialism is a relic of the age of imperialism. In a world that currently prides itself on ideological progress, it is a great shame for humanity that colonial conflicts continue to be heard of. Future developments will depend on the balance of power between the selfish ideas of the colonial powers and the independent aspirations of the colonial peoples. In 1947, colonial conflicts will likely continue to spread and cannot be resolved in a year and a half. "Truth will ultimately triumph," let us hope this is true.</p>
<p>(6) Can the Balkan issue be resolved? What action will the Soviet Union take on the Straits issue?</p>
<p>Answer: The Soviet Union will never relax its grip on Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Albania. Similarly, Britain and the United States will never relax their grip on Greece and Turkey. It will be difficult to change the established facts, and the stalemate will likely persist for a considerable time. This can be said to be both resolved and unresolved. As for the Straits issue, the Soviet Union wants to open a sea window and will not concede a single step. Britain and the United States want to maintain their interests in the Mediterranean region and will not allow the Soviet Union to step over the threshold of the Aegean Sea. In this situation, there will only be constant arguments and stalemates. The final outcome will depend on the overall world situation. If the Soviet Union is at a disadvantage compared to external forces, it will turn its attention to domestic development. Otherwise, it will seize the opportunity to act and exploit vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>(7) Will Middle Eastern oil catch fire and burn?</p>
<p>Answer: Due to geographical factors, the Middle Eastern issue and the Balkan issue are closely related. If the gates of the Straits cannot be broken open, the oil in the Middle East will not ignite a prairie fire.</p>
<p>(8) What will happen in Palestine?</p>
<p>Answer: The cause of the conflict in Palestine is the mutual unwillingness of Jews and Arabs to compromise. Jews want to establish a Jewish state, while Arabs advocate for Muslim administration and oppose partition. It is lamentable that the holy land of both Jewish and Muslim religions has become such a mess! In fact, the Jewish-Arab issue is only superficial. The crux of the matter lies in the conflicting interests of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Currently, Britain supports the Arab nations, the United States is more sympathetic to the Jews, and the Soviet Union sits high in the north, observing developments with a cold eye. The failure of Britain and the United States to agree on the Palestine issue further complicates the situation.</p>
<p>(9) Will the United Nations succeed or fail in dealing with the Franco issue?</p>
<p>Answer: The Franco regime, which was established with the support of fascist forces, has been able to survive to this day entirely because of the significant contradictions that still exist within the United Nations. Frankly speaking, no country in the world supports the Franco regime. The question is not whether Franco should be overthrown, but rather, into whose hands will the Franco regime fall after it is overthrown: the pro-British and American parties in Spain, or the pro-Soviet parties? The resolutions of the United Nations are insufficient to determine everything.</p>
<p>(10) Will the hostile state in Antarctica be limited to scientific competition?</p>
<p>Answer: Antarctica is a virgin land. Currently, it is like the new continent of America hundreds of years ago. Any country can go there. However, it will eventually be closed off, especially to countries whose security is concerned, such as Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, which will inevitably attach great importance to it. Recently, Admiral Byrd of the United States Navy has led an expedition that has already set off, and the Soviet Union is not far behind, with whaling fleets also sailing to Antarctica. However, compared to the naval and air strength and geographical proximity of the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States, the Soviet Union is at a disadvantage.</p>
<h3>"Flying Picture": Trial Use</h3>
<p>At first glance, this picture resembles a team of dancers gracefully performing. In reality, it is the flame emitted by the high-pressure defogging device (Flying Picture) at the U.S. aircraft landing experiment site, used to dispel thick fog.

<h3>We Demand Further Education</h3>
<p>— Ding Lifeng</p>
<p>Voice of Working Youth</p>
<p>To the Minister of Education: While the flames of war have not yet been extinguished and the education sector is busy restoring transportation, school buildings, funding, and other issues, it may seem untimely for us to present you with the following demand. However, we have been holding it in for a long time, enduring suffering for quite some time, and it has reached the point where we must speak these words.</p>
<p>We demand an opportunity for part-time study and further education. We demand that schools at all levels—elementary, middle, high school, university, and graduate school—offer formal classes with formal curricula during after-work hours to teach us, the youth, young adults, and seniors who come from institutions, shops, factories, and elsewhere with a desire to learn!</p>
<p>Current part-time tutoring cannot satisfy our desires. We want to study trigonometry, geometry, calculus, but they are not available. Geography, history, philosophy, law, education, biology, chemical engineering, electrical engineering... they are also not available! Moreover, part-time tutoring does not grant the qualifications for further education, employment, or official ranking. All of this gives us a severe psychological blow!</p>
<p>Our demands are very simple and not difficult to fulfill. As long as the Ministry of Education does not restrict school hours and orders schools at all levels to offer various courses in one or two classes after work hours, providing convenience to those who are employed in terms of time, that will already be a great kindness from the Minister to us and a great virtue to the nation. After this dual-system education is implemented, the atmosphere of pleasure-seeking in society will definitely change. Now, there is no place to go to school; in the future, those who do not go to school will be ridiculed. The general level of culture will gradually increase, benefiting far more than just ten thousand people!</p>
<p>Perhaps some worry that this will lead to an overabundance of university graduates in society. Then, we can tell them that China's backwardness is precisely because education is not widespread enough and some useful talents are buried. We should not worry about university graduates becoming laborers but should worry about laborers not wanting to become university graduates. Otherwise, wouldn't the work of all departments be smoother and the efficiency of work increase even more?</p>
<p>We hope that you will accept our almost angry plea and use a letter to tell all those who oppose you doing so that we, this group of ten thousand youth, young adults, and seniors, will be your eternal support!</p>

<h3>Recent Trends in French Literature and Art</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Claude Roche, translated by Xu Zhongnian</p>
<p>On Sunday, December 22, 1935, in the afternoon, at the ninth "Literary Tea Party" after the victory, Mr. Claude Roche, a Frenchman who had been in China for less than two months, lectured on "Recent Trends in French Literature and Art," translated orally by the author. Mr. Roche is a Parisian with a Master of Arts degree from the University of Paris. He came to China to head the Alliance Française in Shanghai and the College Français. He has extreme admiration for Chinese culture and expresses great sympathy for the Chinese people. This lecture had no written script, and I am now recalling it entirely from memory as follows:</p>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>I greatly admire Chinese culture, but unfortunately, I cannot yet speak Chinese, so I do not know the content of Chairman Xu Zhongnian's introductory remarks. However, partly because of the great French writers mentioned by Professor Xu just now, and partly because, although Professor Xu and I are newly acquainted, I have long admired Professor Xu. His works introducing Chinese literature written in French are very valuable. I dare to assert that Professor Xu and all of you have great sympathy for French culture. I feel very honored and excited about this!</p>
<p>Every nation must have its own unique genius, and that genius is completely different from the genius of other nations. For example, the genius of the French is certainly not like the genius of the Anglo-Saxons, nor is it like the genius of the Germans. What is the genius of the French? It is: being active, realistic, intelligent, refined, and loving beauty. If we were to give a few representative writers for each item, then: in terms of positivism, there are Descartes, Comte, and Zola; in terms of intelligence, there are La Bruyère, Alfred de Musset, and G. Courteline; in terms of refinement, there are J. Racine and Marivaux; in terms of love of beauty, there are Corneille, Bossuet, and Mallarme.</p>
<p>With such genius, there must also be one or two intellectual centers, and that is philosophy. Contemporary French philosophy is divided into two major schools: (1) Existentialism; (2) Philosophy of Science. The composition of the universe is due to "I" and "Non-I." Why am "I" born? What is the relationship between "I" and "Non-I"? What is the position of "I" in the "Non-I"? Sartre, the master of existentialism, tells us that our "birth" is "absurd": who is born after careful consideration and selection? Our "existence" is also "absurd": who thinks our way of life is rational? Another master of existentialism, Gabriel Marcel, is willing to find a "reason" in the "absurd": that is his "hope." In short, existentialism is a pessimistic doctrine, and existentialist literature is a literature that expresses "despair." This doctrine itself is divided into two schools: (A) Closed Existentialism (existentialisme ferme), represented by Sartre; (B) Open Existentialism (existentialisme ouvert), represented by Marcel. As for the "concentration" of pessimism, naturally closed existentialism is heavier than open existentialism.</p>
<p>The so-called Philosophy of Science originates from the study of atoms. The French authority on the study of atoms is Prince Louis-Victor de Broglie, an expert in wave mechanics (mecanique ondulatoire). Not long ago, we always thought that atoms were indivisible. Now we know that each atom contains two components, and there are "gaps" between these two components: so it is intermittent. On the other hand, atoms produce "waves," and these "waves" are continuous. So, in the atom itself already contains "contradictions." Since the "material" in the world is composed of atoms, it is equivalent to all "material" having "contradictions." This philosophy overthrows the previous determinism. The current authorities on scientific philosophy are: de Broglie, Langevin, and Bachelard.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about novels. Current French novels can be divided into three major schools: (1) Resistance Novels; (2) Traditional Analytical Novels; (3) Existentialist Novels. Resistance novels have a wide scope; they not only depict the front lines but also the rear; they not only narrate open warfare but also underground work. The master of this school of novels is of course Vercor; his representative works are "The Silence of the Sea" (Le Silence de la mer, translator's note: this book has already been translated twice in Chongqing, and Mr. Li Qingya of Shanghai will make a third translation recently) and "Starry Night Walk" (La Marche a l'etoile, translator's note: this book has already been translated by Zhongnian and is being published serially in "World Bi-monthly"). French novels have always been good at psychological analysis, with a profound perspective. The object of analysis is the French middle society, which can also be said to be the French cadres; the goal of analysis takes into account both strengths and weaknesses. This tradition has never been interrupted. The leader of the current analytical novelists is Francois Mauriac, the author of novels such as "Kiss to the Leper" (Baiser au leppeux) and "Desert of Love" (Desert de lamour). The existentialist novelists are represented by Camus and Malraux. Camus' novels are divided into two categories: fantastic and existentialist. His existentialist novels specialize in depicting "contradictions" and "absurdity." As for Malraux, he has been to China, and his novel "The Conquerors" (Conquerants) depicts the struggle of the Chinese people around 1930. He wants to find the meaning of existence in action, but until now… he has not found it! Just now we talked about resistance novels, besides Vercor, I must also mention the veteran writer Georges Duhamel: poet, novelist, and also military doctor. He witnessed the cruelty of war, so he is a humanitarian. His "Civilization" (Civilisaton) is a masterpiece (translator's note: this book has already been translated by Zhongnian and will be published in installments by "Wisdom").</p>
<p>In terms of plays, they can also be divided into three schools: (1) Lyrical School, represented by J. Giraudoux; (2) Resistance Plays, represented by Anouilh; (3) Existentialist School, represented by Salacrou. The greatest playwright is of course the martyred Giraudoux. His plays often draw material from Greek literature and folk tales from other foreign literatures; in his plays, he depicts the battle between "reality" and "dream," and the beautiful "dream" often triumphs.</p>
<p>The greatest contemporary poets are four: Paul Claudel, Paul Valery, Aragon, and Eluard. Claudel has been to China and Japan. His poems have an extremely strong mystical meaning. It seems that all things in the universe are playing a great symphony, and each nation is a member of the orchestra. Each person's joys, sorrows, and joys cannot be controlled by themselves and are governed by the conductor, and that conductor is God. Valery's poetic rhythm is the most rigorous, and the rhyme is the most sonorous. He pays attention to form and sings the praises of reason. His poetry is "pure poetry" (poesie pure). As for Aragon and Eluard, they are both patriotic poets; their resistance poems are passionate and moving.</p>
<p>The artistic throne left by Pierre Puvis ce chavannes after his death (1898) has always been inherited by Maurice Denis. He is a skilled muralist, and several famous murals in Paris are by Denis. The painter standing alongside Denis is Desvallieres; the characters he paints more fully express inner unease. Other new-wave painters such as Picasso, Matisse, Untersteller, and Braque, each have their own merits.</p>
<p>Let us end this small lecture with music. Nine years ago, in 1937, Maurice Ravel left us forever. This is an irreparable loss for the contemporary French music scene. His countless and wonderful works, such as "Jeux d`eau" (Jeux d`eau), "Valse" (Valse), "Bolero" (Bolero), "Heure espagnole" (Heure espagnole), "Daphnis et Chloe" (Daphnis et Chloe), are purely French in style. Among the contemporary French composers, there is no doubt that Ravel is second to none. As for the surviving musical stronghold, it is Honegger, who inherits the dual traditions of France and Switzerland. We should also not forget the martyred musicians Jaubert, Allain, and J.C. Touche.</p>
<p>Military and political misfortunes have not diminished French culture; on the contrary, it has given it new stimuli and new exercises. Whether in the present or in the future, I deeply believe that French culture will never disappoint the expectations of friends. (Nanjing, Central University; 35, 12, Restoration Festival, recalled.)</p>
<h3>Autumn in the Borderlands</h3>
<p>— Qiao An</p>
<p>Anyone who has lived in the old capital should agree that the most wonderful climate and things there are not in spring but in autumn. Spring's life is too short; the abundant flowers, like snow, are scattered and buried by the wind and sand overnight. As Su Shi wrote in his poem, "Spring colors are divided into three parts, two parts dust, one part flowing water," which is indeed true. This is probably the case for the vast area north of Kaifeng, influenced by the Yellow River! However, in the long autumn season, the clarity of the water, the purity of the air, the high and clear sky, and the flourishing vitality of plants, flowers, and leaves perfectly complement the human environment of the old capital. Although it is not youth, it is mature without being exhausted. The enduring and grand, noble and balanced nature of our national character can also be reflected in the northern autumn light. The inadequacies of spring are compensated for in autumn, and life is always so flavorful.</p>
<p>In the tenth and twenty-third years of the Republic (1921 and 1934), I twice traveled to Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Suiyuan, all of which were recently battle-scarred places, and both times were at the height of late autumn and early winter when the first frosts were arriving. Traveling northwest from Beiping, it wasn't long before I saw white poplars standing tall in the wilderness. The trees were tall with large leaves, rustling incessantly in the strong and stern north wind, but the trunks did not sway, and the leaves did not fall (until deep winter), symbolizing the strength of the north, filling one with awe. This overturned our usual notion of white poplars as bringing melancholy thoughts of autumn. The autumn air is pleasant, with its fierce and invigorating energy, perfect for striving for achievement. Why must it necessarily be sad? The so-called autumn feeling, in the empty courtyard at dusk, inevitably evokes thoughts of fallen leaves. But in the high autumn on the frontier, you can't see fallen leaves at all, so there's no need to plagiarize old sayings and imitate Song Yu's lament for autumn. The facilities of the PingSui Railway have a unique style among the various main lines. Although even first and second class carriages lack luxurious quilts and sumptuous meals, the seats are very empty, making it easy for one person to occupy a compartment alone. Amidst the endless sand and harsh winds and snow, one can leisurely enjoy a cup of hot tea, feeling that there is a different world. This is something that people in modern urban life cannot understand, nor could the people who were buried here hundreds of years ago imagine. The wind is still the same wind, the trees are still the same trees, but the person experiencing them has changed their heart.</p>
<p>Indeed, Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Suiyuan are no longer the desolate borderlands that people imagine. The second time I went to Suiyuan, there were already modern hotels, and the living and dining conditions were sometimes even more comfortable than in some semi-developed cities along the river and coast. Even the first time I went, when the railway had just reached Baotou, the food available already had southern flavors, and it wasn't necessary to eat oat noodles all the time. One could still enjoy electric lights and the urban entertainment that came with them in the evening. Many things in the world are easily misunderstood through imagination. In fact, even hundreds of years ago, these places could not be considered desolate borderlands. Datong, in particular, was an important military stronghold in the Ming Dynasty, where many people lived luxurious and extravagant lives, enjoying fine wine, beautiful dances, and clear songs. Besides what is spread in folk tales, there are still some physical traces to be found. For example, the roofs of houses in Datong still have owl-shaped ornaments on the top of their gate towers, which, according to the local gazetteer, is a custom left over from the residences of Ming Dynasty military officers. But the luxury of one era has passed, and they look at the people of later generations from underground, wondering whether they are progressing or regressing?</p>
<p>Among these cities, the most moving and admirable, in my opinion, is still Suiyuan. Suiyuan has both a new and old city, neither of which was built very long ago. They are vast and majestic, showing the spirit of long-distance control at the time. Therefore, the layout of streets and alleys is expansive and spacious, without the bad habits of other commercial ports. Whenever there is a night with clear stars and moonlight, walking along the streets, with willows swaying in the wind above and clear, flowing ditches below, and with flat, solid roads reflecting the sparse electric lights, one feels the vastness of the northern land, giving later arrivals endless hope for expansion.</p>
<p>The residents are certainly quite poor, but since the opening up of wasteland in the late Qing Dynasty, they have utilized waterways to cultivate fields, and the nomadic customs are gradually disappearing. Moreover, their lives are simple. In summer, two pieces of cloth clothing are enough, and in winter, one sheepskin coat is enough. The climate is clean, the population is small, and the need for sanitation facilities is also small.</p>
<p>From the Han to the Tang dynasties, these were originally prefectures and counties, but after the Song Dynasty, they fell to foreign tribes, and the people of the Central Plains gradually forgot about them. From now on, we should get rid of the concept of borderlands and instead seek the prosperity of the Han and Tang dynasties.</p>
<h3>### Portrait of a General</h3>
<p>— Fei La Si Gui</p>
<p>Velasquea was a great master of the Spanish art scene in the sixteenth century. Born in Seville in 1599, he studied painting from a young age and was summoned to the court in his twenties, enjoying great fame. He mainly painted portraits, among which the famous ones include "Philip IV Hunting," "Portrait of a Prince," and "Portrait of a General." This is one of his representative works, now kept in the Prado Museum. The Spanish people regard it as a national treasure. In 1660, he was promoted to an official position in Madrid and died at the age of sixty-one. ( )</p>
<h3>### Talks on Poetry</h3>
<p>— Lin Feng</p>
<p>Modern poetry uses lively language to write about lively life, about the pain, anger, wishes, and aspirations of the people.</p>
<p>Modern poetry is no longer the head-shaking and swaying chanting, or the display of elegance in the wind and moonlight. It is a living painting full of blood and tears, forcing the reader to take out their conscience and approach the sunshine of truth.</p>
<p>Modern poetry is no longer a kind of weak moan; it is our weapon for fighting against the darkness. In the cold season, it gives us warmth; in the dark night, it gives us light; in loneliness, it ignites distant hope; when we walk in filth, it makes us purify our surroundings.</p>
<h3>### An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Furthermore, those engaged in espionage work, like military strategists conducting military operations, must be "as still as a virgin, as swift as a fleeing rabbit." At this time, Tsurumi's actions should be still, no matter what, should be still; because he only heard a sound, a sudden sentence, without cause, reason, or result; so he cannot move rashly, only wanting to hear a little more. But at the corner of his mouth, where he was concentrating his spirit and listening intently, his knowledge told him that this voice came strangely, that it was only a "voice in his head," so he had even less need to move rashly.</p>
<p>Judging from the tone of this statement, it can certainly be determined that the speaker is Pingzi. But where exactly is Pingzi? True, Pingzi told him to "move around," and he seems to should take this sentence as a serious warning. But when has Tsurumi ever listened to Pingzi's warnings? When they first met at "Green Field," didn't Pingzi give a warning, telling him to "leave Tokyo quickly"? Just today in the phone call, didn't Pingzi relay Elder Aoki's warning, saying that "the search for the secret letter will not succeed"? Didn't Tsurumi not listen to any of that?</p>
<p>Moreover, at this time, Tsurumi clearly does not know where Pingzi is, and presumably Pingzi absolutely does not know that he is in this living room. Then, this sudden warning, how can we know that it is not because he himself has heard too many of Pingzi's warnings, stored them in his subconscious time after time, and that at this time, in a weakened state after excessive nervous tension, they took advantage of the opportunity to attack? So it is said that he simply does not need to move rashly at this time. Moving would simply be like a person who has just woken up from a nightmare chased by fierce ghosts or a fierce battle, jumping out of bed and running outside, just as laughable.</p>
<p>However, although Tsurumi did not get up and move, he did not completely dismiss Pingzi's warning. Based on the experience of the past two days, he admits that this clever devil, Pingzi, does indeed have some tricks. At least, there is also the old magician Elder Aoki, who has some sleight of hand. He also admits that his current situation is like being in a dragon's pool and a tiger's den, with unpredictable dangers. No matter how shrewd and alert you, Tsurumi, are, no matter how thorough your plans are, and no matter how unrelated you are so as not to be implicated, how can you know that the methods of Konoe are unpredictable, and that the Fifth Column is so all-pervasive, and that they have not collected various clues in advance, and then set up a net to trap Tsurumi himself willingly into the trap?</p>
<p>Therefore, once he realized that the voice was a "voice in his head" from Pingzi, and realized that he should not concentrate his spirit and stop the activities of his subconscious mind, he immediately relaxed his emotions again, calmed down, and tried to hypnotize himself, wanting to return to a state of mental distraction, wanting to sense Pingzi and give him some kind of hint.</p>
