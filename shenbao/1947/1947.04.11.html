<h3>物價委會第四次會議　決定平定米價辦法　龐松舟即來滬謀解決米荒</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十日電〕全國經濟委會物價委會，十日開會時，討論主題為解決最近京滬兩地物價之波動則題。拨米價波動主因在於（一）靑黃不接，（二）南帮米商　蘇常一帶收購　民糧甚多，因之刺激米商心理，今日會中對平定辦法，決定如下數端：（一）政府擬以大量洋米以低價向市上拗售，（二）暹邏安南等地大批洋米陸續可至，是則滬糧可保無處。（三）京滬工人及公敎人員決予配給米糧，（四）糧次龐松舟定明赴滬，與有關方面研究解決滬市米荒，及拋售食米價格，以今後三個月內爲最嚴重時期，惟如以上列各點謀解決，當可安然渡過也。又滬市長吳國植今在物價會上曾報吿滬市糧價之波動原因及情形甚詳。</p>
<p>〔又電〕物價委會十日下午三時召開第四吳國楨等均出席。翁文灝主席。首由吳國楨次會，王雲五，兪鴻鈞。張　璈。徐堪。谷正綱。報吿報告滬米價波動情形。旋由王雲五報吿京滬公敎人員日用必需品供應情形，龐松舟報吿糧價。旋討論提案如次：（一）如何平抑紗價？決議，充實棉紗管制委會機構。（二）食油之增產，決議，（甲）擬由政府辦理油貸，並以使油商購買油料可增產一倍爲原則。（乙）汕價吿漲原因，在運輸不便及出口太多之故，故政府現考慮限制食油出口。（丙）舉辦公油之配售。（三）平抑天津市工資辦法，法議，按照配售六種物品價格為標準，予以平抑。（四）如何調濟並儲備京滬區燃料案，決議，煤量不敷原因在台灣及華北來煤太少，現決設法使華北煤可增加運出量，必要時並購運洋煤，　曰使滬煤存儲至少五萬噸外至十萬噸。餘爲房租一案，因時間問題，今日未付討論。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十日電〕平市物價連日飛漲，尤以食糧爲最瘋狂，今日一日間每袋上漲達五千元之巨，一號麵粉比價已達八萬八千元，紅光美粉漲至十八萬五，稻米亦跟進，最高之小站稻漲至十六萬八千元（百斤），蕪湖機米亦漲至十二萬八千元（百斤），食油亦扶搖直上，棉紗行市略呈軟疲，成交甚多，棉布大致平穩。</p>
<h3>滬者視蘇歸　記團察北來　民生疾苦話蘇北　共軍在沿海東竄西擾　地方基層行政不健全</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海記者蘇北訪問團一行十九人，昨自蘇北返抵滬。此次行程九日，曾赴南通，海門，如皋，東台等地訪問。雖屬走馬觀花，來去匆匆，但就一般情形而論，鄕間民生疾苦，不堪言狀，因而流亡異地者，更日有增加，國軍除據守點綫外，其餘地區，共軍出沒無常，雖城鎭一隅表面上尙稱太平，但距城僅一二里之遙，即已行動不便，入夜更形恐怖。此種現象，在東台如皋以及鹽城一帶，尤稱顯著。</p>
<p>李堡之戰</p>
<p>共軍曾於最近發動一較大規模之竄擾，攻擊如皋東北之李堡，是役於本月二日上午九時開始接觸，共軍以十一個團之兵力，作傾巢來犯，當時駐軍僅一營應戰賴火力之强盛，迫使共軍傷亡慘重，至三日拂曉，共軍以「民兵」前驅，逼近李堡四周土牆，至日間已進入街頭，遂展開慘烈之巷戰，是時國軍已退至東南角一據點，等候援軍到達。至此國軍始自丁家坳及保河口兩地，抽調兩團兵力，加入圍勦，至五日卒將其全部擊退，是役國軍傷亡九百餘人，而共軍則傷亡達三千餘名之多。此次共軍使用武器，其中發現俄式機槍及少量之迫擊砲，事後國軍曾俘獲機槍二十餘挺及步槍二百餘枝。據指揮是役之師長王鐵漢談：共軍此次大規模之侵擾，係來自海道，目前共軍在蘇北沿海一帶，擁有大帆船三百餘艘，東竄西擾，捉摸不定，且共軍因政治工作之無孔不入，行事極爲機動，屢能避免國軍主力，而專以消滅地方武力爲目的</p>
<p>青紗帳起</p>
<p>現民間以靑紗帳起之時期，行將來臨，益增恐懼之心理，國軍方面，對此問題亦殊重視，惟據綏靖司令李默庵表示，認爲目前蘇北態勢，爲三分軍事與七分政治，如欲在靑紗帳起之前，肅淸共軍，則非民間自衛力量予以加强不可。並謂：「吾人決不能漢視蘇北，更不能認爲已是承平，也不能佔計共軍過高，認蘇北禍亂無已」。</p>
<p>剝削重重</p>
<p>至言地方行政，則因基層之不健全，一切工作均不能順利推動，鄕區間更因「壞人」當道，幾有民不聊生之慨，攤派捐稅，名繁多，土痞流氓，乘機而起，敲許勒索，層出不窮。此外，保安隊紀律敗壞，人民對此尤多不滿，聞之令人痛心。</p>
<p>軍事形勢</p>
<p>某軍事長官言談至此，慨然嘆曰：所希望之三分軍事七分政治者，而實際上則適得其反，目前實際情形，部是七分軍事三分政治，距離理想尙遠。並將我軍與共軍之軍事政治工作作一比喻，謂雙方形勢，如一「三角形之金字塔」，共軍之尖端爲政治工作，而後使用武力。而我方則反是，收效自爲大减。</p>
<p>又蘇北各縣高唱實施改革土地政策之際，以目前情形而論，尙僅一紙公文，敵題尙遠。總之，蘇北此行，遍是碉堡，充滿一片肅樣氣氣，雖公路兩旁阡陌間，小麥翠綠，桃花吐紅，然一經對照之下，終因戰爭氣息之濃厚，情緖上爲之大大冲淡矣。</p>

<h3>美貸款予韓之謎　美國務院否認李承晚在滬談話　朝鮮問題研究會主席指李造謠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕韓革命領袖李承晚博士於前日來滬時，曾向本市記者透露：美杜魯門總統已同意將以黃金六億元之貸款援韓，以作建設復興之用。當此訊傳至華盛頓後，美國務院發言人即於昨日正式否認是項借款已得美當局正式同意。記者昨日會將華府否認事詢之李博士，據李氏再度吿稱：在美確曾與社總統商討貸款事，當時杜總統雖未確定借款數目，然對援韓經濟計劃確已予以原則上之同意，並曾表示在韓政府正式成立後，美政府可以美金六億元左右之貸款援助韓國云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕李承晚昨在上海對新聞記者所稱，美國已決定給予朝鮮貸款六億美元一事，國務院某宮員今日加以否認稱：美政府已在草擬朝鮮復興計劃，但關於經費總額及其他問題，尙未決定。經費似遠不及美金六億元之數，數星期前國務院方面曾暗示將制定朝鮮三年復興計劃。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕朝鮮問題研究會主席金榮仁（譯香）本日對朝鮮政治領袖李承晚在上海所發表之談話中所稱「美國準備貸予朝鮮六億美元」一節，指爲全屬揑造之詞，金氏並稱：「該款爲數當在四億與六億美元之間，但美國將用作復興朝鮮經濟之需，根本不是貸款。李承晚作此聲明者，企圖增加其個人之聲望，並以借得貸款，自表功績，但朝鮮並不需要此項貸款云。</p>

<h3>穩定物價的對策</h3>
<p>上海市物價評議會，已於昨日宣吿成立了。在這物價蠢蠢欲動之時，該會正式成立，並召開第一次會議，各方面莫不寄以深切的期望。</p>
<p>依照評議物價實施辦法，評議會之職權有二：（一）評議主要民生日用必需品之售價：（二）協助檢舉違反議價之行爲。是其評價之對象，已確定爲民生日用必需品，而其所用手段，則爲議價而非限價。至於議價標準，並載明：得按照物品成本視當地各業向例，分別酌加利潤成數。其成本之計算，除製造費或進貨原價外，凡利息，捐稅，運費，倉租，管理費，保險費，折耗等，均許計算在內。然則以上各項，如果發生劇烈變動時，勢不得不重行評定，以求符合其成本及利潤。該辦法第十三條對於此點，並已明確規定。可知實施議價之結果，並不如一般人之意料，可以把漲風完全阻遏，或將物價重行壓低到某種程度。其最大的作用，無非加以時間上及價額上的限制，不許其過分暴漲，及不斷暴漲，如是而已。換句話說，牠的作用，是屬於緩和的性質，不是壓抑的性質，牠的方針，又是採用隨時調節的手段，並不作一成不變的硬性規定。所以議價的結果，與其謂爲抑平物價，毋寗謂爲穩定物價來得恰當。何以故？在新議價未經核定公佈以前，不許擅自加價故。如果擅自加價，得適用取締達反限價議價條例，來加以懲處故。</p>
<p>於此，又可推知在投機操縱的不合理漲風之下。評議會實具有及時穩定的能力。因爲按照成本，酌加利潤，此種物價，爲法律所許可，自不得謂爲投機操縱。所謂投機操縱，其漲風一定在合法的成本和利潤之上，自可由該會隨時議定，由主管機關切實執行。况且協助檢舉，亦屬該會職權之一。如有違反議價，擅自漲價之行爲，在評議會本身，也具有檢舉的權力。所以對付投機操縱這種非法行爲，該會確是負此責，有此權的</p>
<p>不過物價的變動，其原因狠多，也有由於投機操縱的，也有由於其他因素的。例如供求上的盈絀，季節性的轉變，銀根的鬆緊，運輸的通塞，捐稅的增减，工潮的起伏，收穫的豐嗇，產價的上落，乃至幣値和外匯的伸縮，政治和軍事的措施等，都可以牽動物價，使牠脫離正常的趨勢。所以要謀物價之穩定，不得不從多方面仔細研究，尋求對案，而各別予以適當的補救。譬如治病，其病源不一，其所用之方劑，自無法從同，所謂因病與藥，或對症發藥，其意義卽在於此。</p>
<p>這幾日來的漲風，已相當熾烈，這是吾由於有人投機操縱，抑尙有其他的原因在內，這問題極爲複雜，似頗不易斷定。昨以當局嚴密偵查，皂燭，火柴，綢緞，棉布，人絲等項，已略見回風，可知一部份貨物的漲風，或確有人爲的因索在內。但大部份的貨價，如米，油，雜糧等，仍在繼續跳躍之中，或竟有行無市，扳售不放，並不因當局的注意或勸吿，而風平浪靜，回復常態，可證此中情形，也並不如理想中之簡單。</p>
<p>自勝利以來，以生產萎縮，遊咨充斥，加以交通，動力，原料，高利，工資，重稅，走私等等原因，工商業的狀况，每况愈下，形同數症俱發，這是無可諱言的事實。所以治療之方，也不得不兼籌並顧，從多面分別着力，以期日起有功。頗聞食米一項，當局已在準備繼續拋售，戶口糖也已決定續辦。油的原料，則先洽妥大荳八千噸，可以撥充廠用，同時禁止出口。工業上的必需品，當局並准供給外匯，源源採辦。此等措施，自是抑平物價的根本辦法。我們希望循此途徑，更廣泛地切實展開起來，一面推行貼放，輔導生產，同時推銷債券，吸收遊資，然後輔以議價辦法，取締一切不合法的投機買賣。似此標本兼施，兼程並進，庶於穩定物價這一點上，或可獲得相當的效果。倘不此之圖，而過分重視這議價工作，恐不免近於奢望。</p>

<h3>外長會議又陷入僵局　德波疆界難確定　現有三種見解無法調和</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十日電〕英美提議修正波閘西部邊界案，今日在四國外長會議中已成絕對僵持之局，據各種徵象觀察，此項僵局且將波及德國全部疆界問題。關於魯爾工業區，萊茵及薩爾之前途，尙未由四强討論，惟西方國家間之一般見解，認爲德國東部邊界問題，如不能獲致同意，則對於任何界綫，均難望得有解決。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十日廣播：據法國代表幽方面聲稱，法外長皮杜爾將要求外長會議立即通過薩爾在經濟上合併於法國，並研究法國所提造成魯爾與萊茵獨立地位之建議。按關於重行劃分德波邊界問題，西方列强與蘇聯間，談判已陷於僵局，今法國復提出此問題，預料整個德國邊疆問題均將陷入困境，而造成嚴朮之政治後果。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科九日電〕四國外長會議本日開會，討論德國疆界問題，發生三種不同之見解，殆難獲得妥協，美國國務卿馬歇爾元帥擁護英國外相貝文之意見，而法國外長皮杜爾與蘇聯外長莫洛托夫，谷有其見解，馬歇爾國務卿欲使本日外長會議，討論德波邊界，皮杜爾外長乘此機會，重言聲明法國對於邊疆問題之立塲，係屬整個的不能分別解決。馬歇爾國務卿與貝文外相於經濟之觀點，所見略同，一致認爲解決邊疆問題，應以經濟的角度，加以觀察，俾能顧及德波及歐洲其他國家經濟發展之利益，從而對於歐洲之和平及安全亦有貢獻。目前所有之疆界，足使德國失去平衡，並使德國割讓大塊農地，使其不能以糧食供給全國人民，故噸採取若干措施，俾使她國工業及農業，獲得平衡。其中最重要者，厥爲波蘭將若干農產地區歸還德國，至於波蘭是吾能充分利用此項土地，對於其本國及歐洲其他各國有所貢獻，殆難斷言。據貝文外相本人稱，波蘭之邊境，在一九一九年時過於向東，而今過於向西，此在法國觀點欲使德國工人與農業平衡，其所採取之方法，則爲德國取得其西方之工業區，以補償其東方農業區之損失。至於薩爾區與魯爾區問題，此於比利時，盧森堡，荷蘭三國提出之領土要求，不能混爲一談。此外蘇聯外長莫洛托夫又堅持其原來立塲，不願與英法兩國之意見妥協，並謂德波邊疆，已爲旣成事實，並爲盟國在雅爾達及波次坦會議時所承認者也云。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科九日電〕英美二國今日在外長會議提議設立國際委員會擬訂德波疆界細則，准許波蘭保留工業區西里西亞之管理權，但波蘭現所佔有之一部份工業地帶應予歸還德國。蘇聯外長莫洛托夫反對此議，謂依照波茨坦協定，波蘭取自德國之四萬方哩土地，包括西里西亞及基地在內，全部應歸波蘭所有。法外長皮杜爾則稱，疆界問題須作進一步研究，至於現行疆界，贊成抑或反對，渠未說明。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科九日電〕四國外次會議本日開會討論未來對德和約應邀請何國參加一項問題，四國外次對於邀請阿爾巴尼亞參加，意見仍極紛歧，法蘇兩國贊成阿爾巴尼亞參加，但是英美兩國則表示異議。美國代表繆斐，提出拉丁美洲國家凡參加軸心國作戰者應否參加和會問題，並謂其中有若千國家，對於對日作戰，有重大貢獻，以是其他國家在最後參戰者，貢獻尤多。蘇聯代表維辛斯基發言，予以駁斥。並謂吾人在此，並非討論日本問題，余希望在討論日本問題時，能較討論德國問題，迅速進行云。</p>
<h3>美共和黨總統候選人　史泰遜晤史達林　坦折討論兩國經濟制度</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十日電〕美國共和黨德統候選人史泰壽昨夜與史達林總理晤談八十分鐘，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫亦在塲。據史氏吿新聞記者稱：「吾人已坦白討論兩國經濟制度。余已要求蘇方供給談話紀錄，俟接獲後或能詳加評述。史達林總理出言頗審愼，偶然吸捲烟」。又稱，此次會在烏拉爾參觀塞維特洛夫斯克戰時製造坦克軍之重工業廠，現改製鑿井設備。史氏在烏拉爾區游歷三日甫返，如果今日大晴，擬飛基輔。</p>
<h3>華萊士主張　美貸欵蘇聯</h3>
<p>不贊成美國援助希土</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕美國前商務部長華萊士在此招待記者：在今後三個月內，美國或將制定足以引起戰爭之外交政策，本人當盡力不使該項政策之決定。渠又曰：英美蘇今仍未放棄帝國主義或擴大主養的政策，惟英國在該方面所使用之力量不如美蘇兩國之大，英國已規定期限，退出印度及緬甸，此乃正當的施策。記者復詢戴高樂最近之政治活動與杜魯門總統之援助計劃有何連擊？華氏曰：渠相信兩者之間有密切連擊。華氏力主由美國貸款蘇聯，惟對　聯之拒絕參加國際機構　聯　國敎育科學文化會等，則表示造憾。關於美國援助希土事，渠謂渠素來反對不具生產目的之放款，渠尤反對政治放款。</p>
<h3>捷克外部代表　哈杜抵莫斯科</h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科儿日電〕捷克外交部條約司司長哈杜及帮辦費斯查，今日抵此，波外交部情報司司長格洛斯二週前抵此，彼等到此之使命未明，可能逗留此問，作爲莫斯科會議之非正式觀察家。</p>
<h3>美議員批評　現政府政策</h3>
<p>謂不應資助蘇附庸國</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕美國參衆兩院現正討論對外援助問題。一部份共和黨議員反對現政府之矛盾政策，其他共和黨議員則繼續敦促加速核准援助美金四億元希臘與土耳其案及美金三億五千萬元救濟中國及歐洲各國案。共和黨　議員白特勒在參院稱：美國正　動世界上最大之懸賞競爭，對於參加競爭之兩方則均加以資助，即一面援助希臘土耳其，同時又在另一方面爲蘇聯各附庸國　款。白氏反對下列三項計劃：（一）國務院要求撥款美金二千五百萬元，結算對　賬目，包括軍備租借脹目之最後解決；　政府擴以馬鈴薯贈與「史達林之主要傀儡即南斯拉夫總統狄托」；（三）波蘭與捷克向國際銀行申請美金借款。共和黨衆議院預算委員會主席泰培要求說明杜魯門何以不能制止對蘇聯佔　領區出口執照，而使美國之外交政策趨於一個方向。泰培稱，渥此言係指聯總結束計劃中對波蘭，南斯拉夫，烏克闌，白俄羅斯各邦之援助而言。衆議院外交委員會方面，大多數議員要求迅速核准三億五千萬美元之對中，義，希，何，奧，波援助計劃，但共和黨反對派議員三人則採取泰培同樣立場，要求將此案經費削减至二億美元</p>
<h3>德境四佔領區　大舉搜索人犯</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社柏林十日電〕此間英美法蘇四國警察昨夜突然同時在各該領區內搜捕逃兵戰犯及黑市商人。據聞此係蘇方所首先提出，旋經四國司令長官決定後乃實行，事前嚴守秘密，知其事者，僅有十人。惟美方若干人士認爲此舉不合民主原則，曾表反對。據消息靈通人士稱：此因美國不承認若干流亡人羣為蘇聯公民，故蘇方擬加以逮捕。除盟國警察外，有德國警察五千人亦參預其事，分赴下流塲所妓院及賭塲等處搜查，各佔領區分界綫皆有軍隊駐守，以防警察越境，免生事端。</p>
<h3>英蘇修約談判　雙方意見懸殊</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦九日電〕關於英蘇兩國修改盟給一事，頃據接近英國政府之人士談稱：英蘇雙方對於盟約均已提出建議，且已表示出雙方意見不啻大相逕庭，是以在英國外相貝文自莫斯科返國之前，未必能簽訂此項盟約。惟大部份之工作均須在貝文外相離蘇返國之前完成，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫於接獲英國依照一九四四年十二月法蘇盟約所擬就之草約後，業已提出對案，其措辭頗爲空泛，英國之草約係參照英法鄧扣克協定而草成者，在其序文中規定簽約國雙方相信此項新約對於解決兩國間所有懸案必大有裨益，但在蘇聯所提出之草約中，並未有此項規定。此外，蘇聯草約旣不言及舊金山憲草，亦未涉及鄧扣克條約，蘇聯並未表示其願見對德國問題負責各國締結同樣之條約，即以第一條而論，英國草約規定德國若採取侵略政策或採取便利其侵略之措施，則兩簽約國應即與對德國問題負責之其他國家磋商，然後即可採取共同揹施。此在蘇聯草約並未言及事前磋商，但無論如何英國人士終希望貝文外相在莫斯科能與蘇聯消除此項不同之意見。初步工作完成之後，即能使英國駐蘇聯大使裴特遜爵士在貝文外相返一國之後，完成此項談判云。</p>
<h3>戰時秘密</h3>
<p>路透社紐約十日電〕顯斯福總統所著「戰時的合作」一書，今日在紐約出版，書中透露羅斯福曾於一九四一年九月三日函敎皇庇護十二世，內稱「余認蘇聯亦有如德國之獨裁制，惟余覺蘇聯獨裁制對他國安全之危臉，猶不如德國獨裁制之甚」。該書復透露，美國在六個月前即已知悉希特勒攻蘇之計劃，當立即通知莫斯科。前美國駐敎廷特使戴樂爲該書所作之序論內有云：由於蘇聯否認宗敎，故援助蘇聯乃敎會之問題，華盛頓與梵蒂岡於此實有交換意見之必要。</p>
<h3>美國物價高漲　內閣會商對策</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕內閣今日舉行特別會議，討論物價高漲問題。杜魯門總統之經濟顧問委員會主席諾爾斯在閣議中宣讀長篇報吿，諾氏昨曾以物價之增漲情形報吿總統，並謂間題「嚴重」。白宮發言人今日宣稱，閣議討論結果，未決定採取何種對策，亦未準備有所行動。</p>
<h3>傳美國參加英印會議　討論印防務問題　官方旣不證實亦不否認</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦九日電〕此間錢慶人士頃談稱：美國最近亦在此間參加英印陸軍會談，討論英軍至明年六月撤退後之印度防務問題，此舉殆亦可視爲美國之反共行動。據傳會談主要內客乃關於英軍撤退後英美需予何種援助，俾可保衛其北境一後門」，防止共產勢力潛入一項問題。此項會談嚴守秘密，參加之美軍官姓名，亦無從探悉。據共黨「每日工人報」稱：此事顯係華盛頓之英美聯　參謀部所發起。據悉：會談業於印軍高級將領卡里巴准將回返新德里時，即已於一週前結束，衆料卡里巴回印後，當將向印境英軍總司令歐慶萊克，印督蒙巴頓及尼赫魯，報吿此次會談之經過情形。又據印度私人方面消息：美國務院官員近在新德里之人數已較過去數月增加三倍，且美國在戰時，實際上已在印度開始建築防務。觀察家並謂：美軍已開往印度北部，緬甸阿桑鐵路及戰時臨時營房等地。此外，美國復已於上月宣佈與印度樹立外交關係，並以借款，貸予印度北部與西藏間之尼泊爾王國。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕此問官方經調查後所得之印像稱：倫敦或在舉行三方面之會談，討論印度之將來軍事政策一項問題，但僅屬非正式與私人之性質。此訊未獲官方證實，陸軍部官員亦拒不置評。聞國務院對此曾詢諸陸軍部，但官方亦未加以否認，致衆人皆認為此訊在目前尙不能公開加以談論。某負責方面則謂問云。</p>
<h3>他連泰爾　任美原子會主席</h3>
<p>業經美參院正式批准</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓九日電〕參議院今日以　十票對卅一票批准任命李連泰爾爲美國原子能委員會主席。李氏前會主持屯尼西原子工程，美國守舊與前進份子對其任命苦鬥十一星期之久，李氏卒告勝利，原子能委員會其他委員業經任命者計有巴邱，魏馬克。派埃克及史特勞斯等四人。該會任務有三：（一）以美國名義掌管全國原子生產及分裂性物質；（二）統制美國全部原子能研究與發展，不論在醫學。工業或科學上，且包括原子武器在內。（三）如果有人洩漏該會認為應守秘密之原子能情報，有權向之起訴。該會並將由一般顧問委員會與陸海軍官組織之軍事連絡委員會輔佐之。</p>

<h3>美電話工潮　可望早日結束</h3>
<p>〔聯　社華盛頓十日電〕全國電話工潮益有早日結束之望，長途電話工人與美國電話電報公司間，對解決工潮基礎今日已成立協議，惟尙須經全國電話工人聯合會指導罷工之決策委員會通過。調解局主任華倫對於此項基礎協定，頗爲讚許，並稱：談判中所獲遲緩而穩健之進展，可望在全國其他各地會議中同樣實現。</p>

<p>或將以侮辱國會罪被控</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕美國共黨秘書長丹尼斯本日拒絕出席衆誶院之　美活動委員會，僅遞呈正式聲明一紙，渠認為該委員會並非「合法之國會委員會」，故不應發出傳票。反美活動委員會認爲此舉乃侮辱國會，本日開會議決，請司法部對於控訴丹尼斯犯「蓄意侮辱罪」一事研究其可能性。此項罪名如果成立，則丹尼斯將被判監禁二年之最高徒刑，並須罰款一萬美金云。</p>

<p>首次物價評議會　白粳限價十四萬　恢奧復配給戶口糖　棉紗每件三百五十萬　請中央月撥大豆萬四千噸抑平油價　　〔本報訊〕上海市物價評議會第一次大會，於昨日上午在社會局會議室舉行。出席委員宣鐵吾，俞叔平，錢乃信，徐寄廎，吳蘊初，水祥雲，程滄波，徐采丞，歐陽崙等。列席社會局經濟行政處長顧炳元政各小組代表。由主任委員吳開先任主席，對物價彼動原因，作詳細分析。繼由顧處長報告一年來議價經過情形，繼由宣鐵吾，徐奇　等先後發表意見　　嗣吳局長接見記者，對米·油·糖·紗布等詳加分析稱；（一）米：宋院長在任時，曾允撥本市存米二十萬噸，隨時抑平米價。後該項存米共到十萬噸，即爲糧食部撥去七萬噸作爲配給公敎人員之用。社會局因存糧不多，市面游資充斥，故不敢輕易拋售。今乃要求糧食部撥足預定之廿萬噸存糧，並要求中央禁止米糧出口，防止搜購，以抑平產地價格。本市中熟米之議價，則因實際情形，自十二萬一千調整至十三萬，白粳自十二萬調整至十四萬。（二）油：汕價須從豆價管制起，目前大豆漲至十一萬一祖，根據三担豆榨一祖油之原則，其一切加工費即與豆餅相抵，則三十三萬一担，即需三千三百元一斤，事實上製造成本需四千三百五十元一斤。而月前限價爲每斤二千五百元，故油廠皆感不能維持。中央原以每祖五萬元之價每月供給本市大豆八千噸，但此數不敷本市需要，故特要求每月增撥六千噸，如此方可絕對控制油市而維持每二一千五百元之價格。（三）糖：糖商前因天氣轉暖，去路將多，特要求將糖價增加百分之五十。評議會認爲糖商非爲製造商而係中間商，所特理由不足，已予駁斥。現黑市糖價約三千二至三千四一斤，特決定於四月間恢復戶口糖配給，每斤價在二千左右。（四）紗布：紗布價格須自棉花管制起，目前棉花每担市價一百萬，根據三担半棉花製一件紗，則開支除外，需三百五十萬。目前限價爲三百五十萬，商人除非由中央貼補，皆感不能維持。故已請中央對棉花確實核定一價格。此外燃料及麵粉決仍維持原價。上項決定，將由吳局長提出今晨之市政會議報告備案。昨日舉行之物價評議會（本報攝）公敎人員配糖　昨起開始發售　　本市公敎人員三月份配給食糖事，業由本市南貨商等同業公會向台糖公司出貨，計一號綿白一千一百包，於昨日起開始配售，凡各機關公敎人具即可持配購證前往附近各承售商店價購，所有三十六家承售商店均縣有食精配售處標幟，並置放糖樣，規定職員及警官谷二斤，警士及工役各一斤，每斤計偎二千元。參會開會商討房屋租賃條例　　〔本報訊〕市參議會爲研究立法院擬定之房屋租賃條例草案，定今日下午三時在該會召集地政，法規及社會三委員會，舉行會議商討，並請其他參議員，及地政，社會等局列席提供意見。參議會組織　市政考察團　　〔本報訊〕市參議會以本市社會之需求無窮，而政府之心力有限，爲發揚民意與推動市政，特組織市政考察團，就市政各部內，作普遍而深入之考察，並邀請各部門主管長官，暨專家共同參加，互相父換意見。考察實施前，根據平時觀感，所有應興應革，製成考察要項，俾把握重點。其考察結果報告醫，送會審核後，請市政府採擇施行，此項決議，市府已接參議會函達，昨特通令所屬各局知照。伏波艦沉沒慘案　檢察官等一行　登海閩輪查勘　今里傳訊有關船員等　　伏波號砲艦撞沉慘案，海軍總部以肇事之海閩輪，依據海商法，雨船相撞，有互救之責，該輪見危不救，使砲艦海軍員兵慘遭滅頂，依據海商法一二八條，及刑法第三百七十條，報請地檢處依法究辦海閩輪船長戴儒林。前晚十一時，地檢處乃派法警拘獲，押往地檢處，當由曹鴻檢察官升座偵訊，至十二時退庭。以該案情節重大，被告戴儒林當晚　押於地院看守所。據悉，偵審時，被告對見危不救一點，矢口否認，曹鴻檢察官爲慎重偵查起見，昨日下午三時，偕陳債顏書記官，許少勇節譯官，由海軍總部黃參謀長承鼎，軍法官陳書茂，及海軍造船廠工程師楊元墀等陪同赴龍華海軍造船廠，由海軍總部備汽艇，駛近海閩輪，審視該輪撞毀之身尾部份。旋即登輪，由該輪代理船長俞止祥，領赴船頭及夾艙駕駛台等地偵察，由楊工程師解釋，詳細研究，並視察該輪之救生設備。至五時許始離輪北返。又該案地檢處定今長九時三十分繼續開庭偵查，並傳訊關係人海閩輪大副吳念祖。當值船員吳侃。舵工鄔富卿。劉芬法。暸望水手馬富根，該輸乘客鄭桂仁。孫雋華。江繼新。羅潛尊。傳票業於昨日發出。同濟繼續罷課　四項決議　再度請願　　〔本報訊〕在罷課中之同濟大學學生，經學校當局殷切勸導後，原擬即日復課，因見昨日報載肇事兵士更正函件及校董對中央社發表談話，詔爲歪曲事實，頗感不滿，決定繼續罷課，並於昨午二時，在工學院舉行第二次代表大會，出席者除大學部各院系代表外，並有附中，高級職業，護士三附屬學校學生代表參加，當即決議：（一）要求負責機關登上海各大報道歉。（二）立即扣留並撤查懲處肇事官兵。（三）限期撤退校區軍隊。（四）公開書面保證以後不再發生同樣事件。據學生代表表示，今晨決再向港口司令部請願，如無結果，則將擴大行動。學生自治會並於今日下午二時，在北四川路一九一號文學院招待記者。資方拒絕發給差金　社局移評斷會核辦　吳開先表示工會可提控告　　〔本報訊〕日來因一部份資方拒發差額金，前住社會局請願者已有機製縫紉業。雕刻木器業。製傘業。製鏡框業。西服業及女式西服業等。社會局勞工處已將該項有關案件，移送勞資評斷委員會核辦。社會局長吳開先對此表示意見稱：資方如有此種不遵法令情形，工會可向法院提出控告。現引起糾紛最多者厥爲童工之差金問題，凡十六歲以下者皆以意工論，唯烟廠童工之工作效率，多在成人之上，而差金則少，故糾紛頗多。然按照勞工法規定，童工不以工作效率爲標準，而以年齡作規定，故不能變更。新財政避長　田永謙就職　人事方面極少更動　　〔本報訊〕市財政局新舊任局長交接儀式，於昨日上午十時在該局會議室舉行。出席各主管處科室首長共五十餘人。前局長谷春帆介紹新局長田永謙與屬員相見後，即作臨別致詞，對過去各同事之合作，特表謝忱。繼由田氏致詞，略稱：過去雖曾担任財政方面工作，惟上海爲國際都市，環境不同，深　因學繼淺薄，不能勝任。幸谷　長已先建就良好規模，今後尚希各同事多加協助，按成規辦去。辭畢，由市府會計處第二科畏耿美璋監視交印後，則告禮成。谷氏　車離去，各屬員儀依送別。記者旋詢新局長對局務及人事方面有何變動，答稱：此次承友好相邀，出長財員，非爲做官而來，故人事方面除出納組長原由稽核科長兼充，此次請辭兼職，已委伍莊接充及委一　印外，其他均無更動。今後局務，因接任伊始，猶待處理，故不願多言。新財局長永謙（本報攝）美新聞處處長易人　　柯德或奉召返國述職　遺缺暫出康納士接充　　美國新聞處處長柯德威氏，將於本月十四日卸任，舉調返國，供職於國務院，其遣缺暫由美大使館發言人康納士擴充。聞柯氏伉魔返美之前，將赴福建一行，重遊福淸故居，蓋柯氏即生長於福建也。阿駐華大使　　阿根廷駐華大使艾斯谷白，將於十六日乘美郵船戈登將軍號　滬。麵粉大女公子　與哈同長子結婚　　〔合衆社香港十日電〕故上海鉅富哈同長子喬奇哈同，十日在此問與榮女士結婚。按榮女士係故麵粉大王榮完敬之女。打浦路上浩劫　卡車起火　延燒成災　燬棚屋近二百間　三千人遊離失所　四人慘死多人灼傷　　〔本報訊〕昨日下午三時許，有滿載電影膠片之運偷卡車一輛，行經滬南打浦路六十二號大餅越門口時，車身後部突然起火，釀成巨災，蔓延焚燬附近草棚百七八十間，並焚斃居民大小四口。打浦路位於斜徐路徐家匯路之間，該處一帶棚戶，鱗次櫛比，有數百橡之多，均係一般苦力，人力車夫，小阪，小工等之住所。昨日午後三時許，華利運輸公司卡軍一輛，（號碼三六五六一號）由司機李阿大（鹽城人，三十三歲）駕駛，上載置於鐵桶內之大批電影膠片，由南向北疾駛。當抵達該路六十二號大餅店門首時，突發覺後車身已起火焚燒。斯時李阿大亟將引擎煞住，見肇巨禍，即偕同車小工五名盧兆忠，林瑞富，（已灼傷雙手及後背部），顧雲生，（傷手足背部）王雲甫，（傷右手頭部）王如金，（傷頭部）棄車而逸。該車火勢旺盛，剎時烈燄飛騰，除車上膠片及車身焚燬外，並延燒附近草屋棚戶，達百七八十間之多。南至斜徐路，北抵徐家匯路，其間已燒成白地一片，居民流離失所者多達三千人。　　勝利餐館死傷六人　　損害情况最慘烈者，厥爲勝利餐館。全家死傷有六人。據悉，葬身火窟中者，有賑房張直淸，（三十二歲），老　之外甥王致超，（十一歲），　子喬鑫，（五十二歲），老司務邱以章，（四十三歲）。老　左印坤，與其妻左田氏，及伙夥工瞎子均被灼重傷，氣息奄奄，嗣經人送置慈醫院施治。此外德泰木行全部房屋悉遭焚去，損失不貲。陳餘泰雜貨烟紙店及小茶館，大餅舖各一家亦全燬。淮南小學及民衆學校。略有損失。同時打浦路八十號中紡第六印染廠請願警陸宗仁被灼傷頭手部，嗣由廠方伴送醫院診治。該廠未遭殃及，誠屬僥倖。起火後，中央，新開河，泰山，吳興，及南市各消防隊，咸驅車往救，直至晚間七時許始救熄。該管蘆家灣警局得報後，亦即由正副分局長趙佩僅，孫思明偕股長郝景懿，率巡官倪家鳳及全體便警義警等到塲彈壓。　　火首司機轉輾拘獲　　火首司機李阿大，偕小工等潛逃後，郝股長立飭倪巡官查出三六五六一號卡車係華利運織公司所有。當率警往虹口禮陵路元昌里廿一號該公司，又查明該車實係居住東長治路慶餘里三十四號吳廣福，盧老三合資購置，戤貼於該公司經營者，遂轉往該處詢得司機住楊樹浦廣興碼頭奚家宅四號，追踪馳往，果將李緝獲。李並供出五小工在提籃橋一小醫院就診，即至該院將小工五名一栟帶局偵訊。據供，「該電影膠片係廣東路四川路亞細亞報關行交其由日暉東路開平碼頭裝運至滬西白利南路者」云云。至起火原因，則警局尚在繼續偵查中。唯火塲上流言紛紜，謂係有人搭車，誤將香烟頭拋擲於松香質之膠片捲上起火所致云。（上）正在施救之打甫橋火塲（下）肇禍之大卡車（本報攝）無錫人報　在滬呼籤　報告被換搗毀經過　請本市同業聲援　　〔本報訊〕無錫人報於前日因刋載「補票糾紛」消息，被邊疆學校一部份學生聚衆搗毀。昨日無錫各報聯合停版一日，以示抗議。人報社長孫翔風昨日下午特假本市杏花樓酒家招待本市同業報告經過，並以最近全國各地新聞事業及從業員一再遭受毆辱搗毀，新聞自由備遭摧殘，事關整個新聞界之切身利害，因此呼籲同業切實聲援，要求當局澈查究辦，而謀今後有效之保障。孫社長復稱：此項新聞措詞極爲審慎，對於邊疆學校師生絕無冒犯之處，詎於下午四時許，先有該校敎師葉佩章等兩人至報社，態度强橫，要求更正道歉。社方當時請其指示文內究竟何處失實？何處必須更正？則除該校學生係赴蘇旅行，被誤作自滬回錫外，餘均不知所答。兩人旋即拂袖而去。不料未及十分鐘，即有該校學生百餘人，分乘大卡車兩輛，手持木棍黃石等物，　湧而至，將印刷營業兩部，搗成雪片。來重如印刷機器，鑄字爐，鉛字架等，細微至時鐘文具，無一倖全。經理范力琪及工友兩人，均被毆重傷。約計損失在二億元以上。現已被迫暫行停刋，除一面力籌儘速復版外，決依法進行訴究，要求懲凶賠償。查獲放火隊　小孩身懷汽油　供係共黨指使　　本市連日迭起大火，而起火原因，極爲奇突。警備當局對此現象，已加密切注意。據悉，本市現已發現由共黨組織之「放火隊」，或與連日之大火有關。此種類似組織，在南京，徐州，曾先後發現。警局閘北分局，日前曾查獲身懷小瓶汽油之蘇北籍小孩四名，企圖不軌。據供係受共黨人員之指使，惟此指使人迄今尚未緝獲。又悉，浦東方面，近有零散之土匪發現，經查明係受共黨李亞民部所指揮。該處警備力量至强，該股散匪正在搜剿中，無礙本市治安。茂昌棧白烟　餘火食日可全熄　　〔本報訊〕茂昌堆棧大火，經四十小時之延燒後，已成尾聲。據消防處負責人稱：可望於今日全部撲滅。昨日午前，原派駐於火塲之大批消防員及救火車，已奉命陸續撤離。僅留少數人員繼續灌救。記者昨深晚再度巡視火塲時，火焦氣味雖農，然隔昨大火之處，僅見白烟嬝嬝，已在續漸熄滅中。至此次起火原因，虹口警局將扣押人犯偵查後，尚無端倪　　〔又訊〕茂昌虹口堆棧大火損失奇重，內有大批物資係行總上海分署所儲藏者。據記者昨日向有關方面探悉，該署儲存之物資，計有：醫藥物品一千五百包，毯子三千另四十條，布二十疋，棉被二十一條，自行車八箱，湯粉一百餘箱，牛奶一千餘箱，口糧二十八箱，以及其他零星物品等。至損失確責情形及價值數字，尚待詳細調查，其

<p>金鈔黑市又趨猖獗　財政部電囑嚴加取締　　〔中央社本市訊〕財政部頃電請淞滬　備司令部，市政府，並飭中央銀行嚴密注意取締日趨猖獗之滬市黃金美鈔黑市交易。據該部所獲報吿稱；本市若干錢兌莊與各洋行勾結甚密，秘密搜購美鈔，以四川路一帶錢兌莊，如祥泰永盛，祥生·成記·華太·恒茂·濟典·茂豐·同豐·國太·寳成·同和。萬太等家非法交易最多。又四川中路橋畔海軍青年會門首時有類似商人者，作美鈔之秘密交易，爲數雖小，但似有一集體購之組織。至開設於各交易大樓中之銀號，表面似爲股票買賣，實際上仍爲金鈔黑市交易，其金鈔之寄存則多在外商銀行之保管庫內云云。當局流查棉紗黑市　制裁投機方案已送交市府　　〔中失社本市訊〕本市物價由棉紗領導而起漲風，經經濟偵察團鎭壓後，前日紗布曾稍下跌，惟其餘日用品則仍上漲，尤以股票方面，爲一般投機分子集中之對象，羣相哄抬，永紗股創三一五〇元新高價，警局經濟科徐科長幼祚，昨長親至股市偵查，對證券塲外交易取諦後而發生之暴漲現象，認證交當局應負責注意。　　棉紗市場方面，昨無正式交易，全部流入黑市，警局經濟科對此，已開始澈查中紡配紗情形，及黑市發生之原因。　按中紡公司每日配紗約三五〇件，一部份配給紗商，平均每人配得一件，另一部份配給複製廠，則每廠三四十件，五六十件不等。此中最可注意者，爲紗商求過於供，而複製廠則供過於求，故造成紗商向黑市求紗，複製廠以剩餘售予黑市之現象。　　再瀋陽紗價每件現高於滬市約二百萬元，故外帮拚命吸收，亦爲紗價上漲原因之一。　　上海每月紗之生產數字，據正確統計爲六萬件，銷給織布廠者三萬件，配售本市紗商者一萬多件，其他一萬多件則供給全國，以此數字視之，紗之生產量當較需要量相差遠甚。又警局經濟科所據「穩定物價制裁投機操縱」方案，昨經宜司令批准，送交市府採擇施行。三種公債還本　昨日執行抽籤　　財政部發行之二十五年統一公債丙種債票，二十七年國防公債，及三十年建設公債第三期債票，昨在仁記路七十四號中央信託局四樓執行抽籤。該部公債司陳司長炳章親臨主持。由審計部上海市商會及銀錢兩業同業公會，各派員蓋視。中中交農四行派員執行抽籤籤事務，所有此次中籤債票及到期息票，依照各該債票條例規定，由各地中中交農四行，及中央信託局辦理兌付手續。統債續漲　　公債昨賡續趨榮，掉換美金公債以及倍數償還等揣想，仍在一般心理中活躍，三六〇室有納，統丙晨開一三〇〇〇元，自一二八〇〇元起盤高至一四〇〇〇元，始有回降，結果尙形平穩，結果較前收計甲乙升五百元，統丙漲起一千二，丁升七百元，戊好八百元，成交約四五百萬。外股買胃頗旺　　外股昨雖有獲利了結者，但以港市繼續報漲，洋行帮及廣帮買冒胃不怠，證券帮亦出後復進，臨收仍見俏利，怡紗晨三三三〇〇元，中途見三二二〇〇元低價，最後復以三三八〇〇元高價結束，結果較前收計怡紗英聯業廣漲半成，紙業平平，餘股均吿微升。輸入管理執委會　昨舉行會議　　通過要案兩起先行發表　　〔本報訊〕輸入臨時管理委員會執委會，於昨日下午三時起，在國行三樓會議室，舉行會議，由李馥蓀主席，討論至七時許，始告散會。通過要案多起，最重要者二起，昨日先行發表。其餘候整理後，於今日補行發表。昨日發表之要案：（一）進口物資加工後再行出口物資之處理辦法，雖經輸出推廣會執委會提交本會商討，經研究一過，認爲問題複雜，須俟與輸廣會召開聯席會議後，方能決定採納與吾。（二）通過不需外匯而准予輸入之外匯來源審核原則共二條：（甲）申請人或用貨人，於卅六年二月十七日以前，在國外銀行或機關及殷實工廠商行，以本人名義存有款項者，並經該銀行機關工廠或商行保證，為輸入許可證取得後，負責撥付該項貨款，不再移作別用。（乙）爲避免刺激黑市起見，美鈔黃金，均不適用。人絲交易稀少　　昨日人造絲公會接得警備司令部電話，囑暫停交易，故昨日無正式市情。塲外交易，上午一二〇號高山有光喊價八百葛元，最小七百九十萬元，但乏人供應。下午又喊大至八百十五萬元，比上日小去十萬元左右。廠經交易亦稀，昨B字等級雖有成交，價做八百八十二萬元，不過以雙馬五擔頭陳貨作價八百二十萬元交換，故非正式行情，喊價大致與上日價相仿。綢貨因不乏乘高出籠，故昨市路疲。大誠格十　縐開盤喊一萬八千八百元，賣多於買，乃呈下跌。最後一萬八千二三百元有成交，被面喊價亦小五萬元之譜。　　恢復配售　　〔本報訊〕確息：中央信託局對日易貨之人造絲一批計四千箱，昨已抵埠，刻正下卸中。故該局對本市絲織業及　帶樂所霞之人造絲，又將恢復配售云。黃金私運香港　財部令飭嚴緝　　〔中央社本市訊〕自黃金禁止買賣後，滬市雖無公開交易，但黃金外流現象日甚一日，據財政部所獲報吿，目前因香港金價遠較上海官價爲高，故一般掮客之流，大量搜購黃金運往香港，圖漁缺利。其運輸方法，爲以飛機空運。組織嚴密，財政部除已電飭海關總稅務司　轉飭所　嚴密查究外，頃特電請滬市府繼飭所屬進行查究，警局行政處昨已分令各分局密加注意。我國輸日食鹽　應確定合理價格　　〔本報訊〕中信局易貨處負責人將於下週內飛日，有所公幹。據聞此行之主要任務爲：（一）我國輸日之主要貨物爲食鹽，惟近因英鹽之競爭，以致對方有意抑低我國出口鹽之價格，故此時須與盟軍總部交涉，確定一合理之價格。（二）中紡各廠現亟需紡織機之各項零件，日本現有剩餘零件可補充，如細辦法亦有待交涉。南市塲漲風警人　高白粳逾十四萬　食油買氣濃厚價又奔騰　　民食趨勢殊足此人注意，投機米蠶月無法記，作崇未已。昨日南市塲漲風熾烈，頂白粳竟逾十四萬元大關，為十四萬四千元。白元出十六萬關，爲十六萬五千元。其餘各級貨猛跳五千至一萬元。北市塲以前日漲勢過烈，昨日趨勢稍軟。中白元高陰元稍跌二千元，白粳未動，客貨登記量未增。昨日總數僅及四千一百九十石，內計北市塲一七〇五石，南市塲二四八五石。　　〔又訊〕昨麵粉消化轉活回漲千餘元，勢成免起鵬落之狀。麩皮貨主甚堅，提高千元，亦然乍升乍降。豆餅以原料猛漲不已，賣氣堅挺，價格上漲一二千元。黃豆華北來貨大减，長江來源亦少，油廠進胃頗殷，本街隨之搜購，按步上漲，再加三五千元。赤豆南洋搜購頗力，冉冉上升，步挺三五千元。菉豆依然平正，苞米彷彿，來去兩稀。紅糧消路尙爽，挺進一二千元。蠶豆則畏縮不前，退底一二千元。芝蔴堅穩之狀，生仁洋莊進胃蝶聯飛黃騰達，猛烈暴漲一萬餘元。小麥物稀爲貴，續漲二三千元。　　油市仍然求過於供，靑島來電吿漲，並有禁止南運出口說，買氣濃厚，登峯造極。生油繼續猛漲萬餘元，一豆油劇漲二萬元，蔴油淸油均一致奔跳萬元。加強美金債券推銷　國行派員指導工作　　〔本報訊〕昨日新債券募銷情形，計有中國銀行經募中國保險公司短期庫券美金三萬元，美金公債美金一萬元，聞國行國庫局對八十一家委託行莊經募之激額，將於本週末發表詳細統計。又國行爲加强債券之推銷工作，協助各委託行莊起見，特派幹員十一人，指導推銷工作。該項指導人員之分派辦法，計國家行局一人，大四行（金城·鹽業·中南·大陸）一人，小四行（中國實　·中國通商·中國國貨。四明）一人，川帮銀行一人，信託公司一人，錢莊一人，浙江實業·浙江與業·上海·新華一人，其他一人。外銷桐油統計　三個月來七千噸　　〔本報訊〕據中國植物油料廠統計：本市本年一二月份外銷桐油共四千噸，三月份共三千噸。最近以桐油國外市價頻跌，故外銷暫陷停頓狀態中。　　又訊：大美輪船公司批尼爾威利斯號，前日離滬返美，裝桐油五百噸，運舊金山。溫州新龍井價挫　外銷茶供多於求　　到源不絕之溫州新龍井，仍因供戶活躍，趨勢支持無力，刻下同業互做價逐步下挫至一百萬至一百十萬元，比隔日續降一二十萬元左右。　　專供內銷之紅綠茶，邇來本街及客帮之去化，雖動而乏整。但因執貨者人心不餒，乃市勢盤旋不墜。茲悉：同泰祥茶行爲展開客帮各路茶銷起見，最近將有數十担徽州烘靑，裝往營口。如能順利進行，則內銷茶市當能漸露曙光。至於洋莊茶市，賣氣充溢，買戶束手，形勢依然頽唐，價格方面衰軟日甚。新多陸續參加　華股紛見高價　　華股昨得物價方面之特殊刺激，新多陸續參加而更見堅俏，業中大戶勇往直前，盡力聲援，堅苦抗爭之下，終以高價結束。晨開續昂，遞交登塲四號二二號一八三號一〇五號咸購，六一號等則進現永紗，開後步漲到遞永紗三三〇元，現永紗三〇五〇元。九一號一四二號二三一號一七一號逢高賣到三〇七〇元，九四號一四五號二一八號七六號二二三號一五三號均進，一四號八九號亦納現永紗，中絲新股及五和首先漲停，而扳高至三一六〇元。一七一號一八〇號一一七號一五五號三六號逢高了結，降至三一一〇元。四號一四五號仍買現永紗，一八五號八九號一四五號一四號亦進遞永紗，十一時一刻後，又將遞永紗拍高至三二〇〇元。九四號四七號一五五號一八五號一九八號七六號二一九號均售，降至三一三〇元。一七一號二二四號一八五號忽來補進，近午再拉上至三一八〇元。八九號脫手，午收稍挫，內衣高後步降，竟以低價結束。結果較前收計永紗信和美亞華豐新光勤興新華微漲，中法漲半成，遞交因前日祗半天交易，計永紗信和美亞華豐新光各漲一成左右，冷股五和漲停，內衣跌一成强，永公大通微跌，餘者平平及微升下等。掉期貼價自八〇元退至五五元，銀行帮及空方貼進，後經多方一四五號四號一九七號一八四號一七一號等貼出，後圍漲至七〇元。合日息約八分至一角。　　午後二二六號二二三號二一八號之供售，曾低落至三一二〇元。九四號一四號八五號一九八號一八三號一八八號三五號八九號一七一號六一號之一再維持，終吿逐步轉倘，遞永紗盤高至三二四〇元。一八八號九七號二二三號六〇號逢高供售，曾國低至三二〇〇元。五和首告漲停，中法新亞亦曾停板，二二號一一七號一四八號一八五一九八號一五六號均進。臨收時漲高到三二七〇元以上。結果較前收計永紗華豐新光漲一成光景，中法漲停，信和美亞升半成，勤興新華徼升。遞交計永紗美亞華豐新光各漲一成半左右，信和升一成，冷股中絲五和漲停，新亞漲停後有園，統益漲一成，國貨永公微挫，榮豐中紡商務火柴升半成，餘均微升，塲外各股均再徵漲。美棉行情上漲　　〔法　新聞社紐約九日電〕此間外交　又盛傳美國將以款項貸與中國之後，此間棉花市塲之行情突有上漲之趨勢。美棉十五萬包業已售與中國，惟因無法付款，故未能出口。美國貸款中國，當能使此項棉花運往中國云。　　日本棉貨暢銷英美　　〔法國新聞社東京十日電〕日本棉貨又在世界市塲獲得出路，棉布二千九百包，今日自神戶運往美國，另有四千九百餘包，運往英國各屬地，如馬來與婆羅洲等。日本棉貨之製造，係由美國供給棉花財部增強保險業務　最低資本額提高為一萬萬元　嚴定產物保險業簽單人資格　　〔中央社南京十日電〕財部近爲增厚保險業資金，並使其發展健全起見，除將保險業最低資本額提高爲一億元外，並以保險業簽發保單人員責任重大，應嚴格遴選，特規定產物保險業簽單人員資格，爲（一）國內外大學商學系，經濟系，銀行系或保險專科學校畢業者，（二）曾任保險公司總副經理或業務經理三年以上者，（三）曾任保險業公證人三年以上，並經担任保險公司業務部職務者。上項資格之審核，應由各地同業公會組織保險業簽單人員審核委會負責辦理。如無同業公會，得送呈部審核。同業公會審核後，應運同證件報請該部核辦。蘇省各產米區米價　概按滬價八折計算　　警備司令部以最近本市食米價格重趨上漲，其原因係受愈地米價上漲之原因，故已電呈國民政府，請轉令江蘇省政府抑平該省各產米區之米價。茲悉江蘇省主席王懋功對此已採取緊急措施，規定各產米區米價槪以滬地米價八折計算，即抑低二成。故本市米商前因議區米價較滬地爲高，對採辦食米咸裹足不前，自聞王主席此一措施後，已紛紛向各產米區採購大宗國米，啓運來滬，故本市米價可望重見穩定云。　　頃據中央信託局羅吟圃副局長語記者稱，該局四月份所採購之邏米二萬四千噸，於本月下旬準可運抵本市。同時該局爲充沛食米存底起見，五月份決繼續採購。但採購數量現尙未能決定。惟預料五月份之數量較四月份將更爲增多。限制外貨輸入以來　調味品營業有轉機　本市各廠月可出貨　　〔本報訊〕據工商輔導處調查：本市調味品工業同業公會會員共十四家，停工者二家。各廠現在每月可出調味品約十萬磅，天廚出品約佔十分之二。如發揮全能力則可達到卅萬磅。不但可以自給自足，且有餘力以供輸出。茲如每月製造十萬磅味精（百分之七十五），所需主要原料，

<p>新醫與新藥預防癆病的疫苗　「皮西其」　BCG  王命欽　　最近的報章或雜誌上常常可以看到治療結核病新藥的發現。然而當我們提起肺癆兩字，仍使人有談虎色變之感，究其原因，乃蓋項結核菌往往會在不知不覺之中侵入到你的肺部，漸漸地發展蔓延，終於將你的肺部爛去而至不可收拾。然而人類究竟是聰明的，所以遠在數十年前就有人在研究對付癆病的方法，結果就發現了「皮西其」。可是二十年來我們對於這抵　肺結核的武器似乎已經忘却，直至最近，歐美各國對於它的研究又努力起來，雖然它的功效尙未十分確定，然而它在世界醫學史上的功績已是永遠不可磨滅的了。有許多許多的人，其中尤以嬰孩爲多，曾藉它的力址而始終不爲這「白色的鼠疫」所製擊。　　「皮西其」的力量旣然大得驚人，可是成本却非常低廉，在美國每一劑量還不上一角錢，它的用法也很簡便，用後也沒有什麽反應，至於它的製造却很費時，這是它唯一的缺點。　　我們日常所熟識的打防疫針，打血淸，種牛痘等，在醫學上流稱爲免疫。「皮西其」就是同牛痘苗差不多的東西。牛痘苗是把天花菌接種在牛身上，漸漸這被接種的牛皮膚上就發出痘疤，把這痘疤內的漿水取出，研磨後製成甘油浸劑，就是牛痘苗。所以牛痘苗裏面的主要成份就是活的天花細菌，不過這種細菌，已不是原來的細菌，曾經投了一次胎，牠的毒力已經减弱，所以當種到人身上的時候、不致發生危險，但是它的另外一種力量——呌人產生抵抗力的力量——却依舊存在，所以當後來眞的天花細菌侵人人體時，這因種痘而產生的抵抗力就發揮出來，而救人於危了。「皮西其」的原理和種痘相同，可是牠的製法却有些兩樣。也是用結核菌（癆病菌）不過不是種在牛身上，乃是在培養劑內培養。把結核菌種在培養劑內（牛膽甘油製劑）。幾年以後，細菌的毒力逐漸减弱至不能呌人發生危險的程度，同樣它的致人產生免疫力的性質仍舊存在，這就是「皮西其」。　　爲什麼呌它「皮西其」？它的效力究竟到什麼樣程度呢？看了下面這段歷史你就可以明白了。一九〇八年有兩位法國科學家Albert　Calmette和Camille　Guerin。他們曾將極微量的結核菌接種在牛的身上。結果發現此牛對於結核病產生了有相當效力的免疫性，於是他們就繼續的研究。十三年以後，終於利川了長期培養的方法，將細菌的毒力逐漸减小，而能施用於人體。這就是所謂「蓋顧氏桿菌」。因爲它的英文名字Bacillus　of　Calmetteand　Guerin頭三個字母是「BCG」，所以就稱它爲「皮西其」了。　　這新的發現震動了整個的歐洲。大受各國的歡迎，如法國，丹麥，瑞典，挪威等地，凡是母親有肺癆病的，她的嬰兒在出生後十日就給他們春服「皮西其」。英國衛生部並且決定設立一製造此疫苗的實騐室。可是在新大陸，「皮西其」却不受歡迎。因爲在一九三〇年德國魯堡地方，曾經發生過一件不幸。有二百五十個嬰孩，在接種「皮西其」後幾個月內反而死亡了七十三個；雖然後來調查出來是因爲培養劑內不小心沾染了毒性極高的結核菌。因此美國人就一直避免使用此法，一方面故然是由於歐洲的科學家尙不能控制它的效力，一方面也是怕會再有一次不幸。可一是現在美國也在注意這差不多已被遺忘了的預防結核的武器了。　　經過美國許多科學家的研究以後，他們得到了一個共同的結論。就是說『「皮西其」不能被譽爲神奇之藥，牠不能醫治，也不能算是絕對的預防劑，不過在容易接觸結核菌的環境下，「皮西其』實在是唯一的良好預防藥。」此外還有三個有趣的實騐。一九三五年在賓州大學有位阿羅遜醫師。他費了六年功夫，在美國西部四個癆病猖獗的地方及南阿拉斯加十二個團體裏面，選取了三千多個未患結核病的印第安孩子，把他們分成兩組；其中一五五〇個注射「皮西其」，另外一四五七個却秘密地以鹽水代替了「皮西其」。這兩批人都住在同樣汚穢的茅屋裘，和癆菌接觸的機會完全相等。假如「皮西其」沒有預防作用，那末這兩批印第安人傳染肺結核的人數應該相等。可是結果阿羅遜醫師却發現那些印第安人裏面，凡是因患結核病而死的，其中注射鹽水者佔二十八人，注射皮西其者僅有四人而已，同時還有一位芬格遜醫師，他用五年功夫，將醫院及肺病療養院裏的女護士作試騐。結果未經注射皮西其的護士傳染肺結核的機會比注射「皮西其」者大四倍。此外尙有位約瑟夫，巴多醫師在癆病猖獗的貧民區域裏將兒童隨意分成兩組，他們都住在同樣的環境裏。數年後，巴多醫師發現凡經過「皮西其」注射的兒童因癆病而死的有千分之十八。七，患癆病的有千分之一三五。至於未注射的則死亡爲千分之四七·四，傳染癆病者有千分之二三七。從上面幾個實騐報吿裏看來，那「皮西其」究竟有如何樣的功效都可明白了。　　最後說到「皮西其」的用法，可分兩種，嬰兒用口服法，因爲嬰兒皮膚嫩不宜注射，並且嬰孩的粘膜容易吸收。至於兒童及成人則多用皮下注射法。據說本市巴士德研究分院已有該項疫苗發行。此外如蒲石路中西療養院聞亦已採用該項疫苗有相當時間了。麻疹漫談（續完）  謝筠壽　　（三）室內不可太光明，因爲病人患結膜炎時，怕光的關係，可用窗帘遮住强光。　　（四）安靜就褥，不但有熱的時候，應當如此，熱退後，也須二三週就褥，禁往室外行動，俗有瘄子不滿月不出外的規矩，確有見地。　　（五）如果有結核的小兒，麻疹後更應注意他的健康，大約三個月。　　（六）口腔，眼，鼻腔等應保持淸潔，用硼酸水等洗滌或嗽口，以避免各種合併症。　　（七）食物當然是選擇容易消化的流動性食物。　　（八）發疹齊全後，熱尙未退，或有其他任何變化的時候，應當急速報吿醫師，相機治療，不要因循坐誤才好。　　麻疹最可怕的是什麼呢？就是一種合併病，合併症當中最多而且最危險的，要算麻疹性氣管枝炎，進而引起麻疹性肺炎，最多發生於五歲以前的小兒，尤以體質虛弱的幼兒，發生更多，病兒的面色，忽然呈蒼白色，有時變成紺色，呼吸困難，高熱不安，世俗所講的「麻疹發不出，或內陷的」，大多是這樣的情形。麻疹合併肺炎，多在麻疹發疹最旺盛的時候，有時麻疹經過順利，熟已下降，再引起發熱，誘發肺炎，預後大多不良，就是幸而肺炎醫治合法的話，也要使麻疹的恢復期遲延。　　次之是　障碍，發生赤痢樣的下痢，大便次數增多，便爲粘液水樣，有時竟然合併眞性赤痢，病兒就狼狽不堪。　　第三爲腎臟炎，小便短少，顏面浮腫，尿中有蛋白質，但沒有猩紅熱時候那樣的多。第四爲百日咳，麻疹合併百日咳的話，使預後大為不良。第五為　在性結核，譬如肺結核，淋巴腺結核等，常常因麻疹而躉延擴大，俗就呌做痧癆，竟有引起票粒結核，急速死亡的事情。第六為眼病，如結膜炎，眼瞼炎，俗就呌做「痧子眼」，竟有引起潰瘍性角膜炎，而致失明。第七為重篤的口內炎，竟有合併水癌，（即走馬疳）敗血症而死亡的。第八咽頭炎，有時變成無聲症，竟有合併眞正的白喉。吾在上面已經寫了不少的合併症，所以說麻疹的本病，並不可怕，可怕的還是在於合併症呢！醫藥通問  程瀚章　楊士達　醫師主答　　答章君寰：（一）日間少疲勞睡前服鎭靜劑如溴化鉀之類，可治。（二）係神經不安靜之故。（三）與迷信無關。　　答蔣公權：是口唇周圍肌肉受損害，致不能弛縮之故。可至醫院行外科手術可愈。　　答黃仁淸：（一）是包皮炎。（二）須行外科手術將包皮割去。（三）不治，恐將腐爛。　　答望華：體格短小，屬於先天遺傳，無法可洽。（二）雀斑亦無特效藥。（三）面上顆粒，可用硫黃皂洗面。　答田秀峯：（一）可服油類輕瀉劑，如Agarol等。（二）宜注射麥角素由醫處方。　　答王大妹：可减少脂肪性食物。忌肥肉，油煎食物等。　　答吳玉文：（一）無關。（二）內服鎭靜劑可制止遺尿。（三）極慢。　　答孫鶴年：胃內已有潰瘍之徵象，故大便呈紫紅色（胃出血）速赴醫院求治。　　答王心民：（一）確是消化不良。（二）再加食麵包數片。（三）可注射葡萄糖針，一日一回，百分之五十的溶液二十公分。　　答胡寳昌：（一）與結核病有時有關。須行檢查其分泌物中有無結核菌。（二）最好行手術。（三）神經衰弱，可內服三溴片劑。　　答杜鳳岐：是神經性心搏急速症。未必即可認爲心臟本體有病　　答謝昌隆：（一）月經遲緩，可內服阿葛滿新片，並注射內泌素。（二）婦科醫均能診治。（以上由程瀚章主答　　答悅昌：先天性肓且醫十樂難難奏効。　　答胡笠：（一）鬍鬚早生是身體關係。（二）（三）無特効藥可使之除凈。　答法學院一學生：（一）眼圈發靑。盜汗。手冷（但熱溫正常）現象是身體衰弱的緣故，不一定是肺病現象。（二）X光透視發見「支氣管影深」是閣下會黑支氣管炎，不一定與肺病有關。（三）肺部發見「老巴」就是肺病已痊愈，結成「疤痕」。綜觀以上現象：閣下曾患氣管枝炎及肺結核已痊愈。　　答顧哲生：（一）此病無特効藥，（二）「癩　停」有相當効力，（三）美國現有Tridione新藥，上海尙未見有售，（四）遺精與此疾無直接關係，（五）包皮過長，對此疾亦無關係。　　答楊永爲：閣下患脫腸症（俗稱小腸氣）及鼻膜炎，投市立醫院求治，短期內即可痊愈。　　答葉盛：閣下係患肺結核及神經衰弱，病寵旣然轉好，自然應當繼續休息，增加營養，有可能，並應注射葡萄糖，鈣，及維他命乙丙之類針藥。（以上由楊士達主答）新中醫之謎（二）  洪貫之　　（二）中醫的玄說與經驗　　在沒有說到科學化問題之先，總得還要把中醫學術的「本質」，來剖析一下，中醫的理論，本是建築在空想上面的「玄說」，陰陽、五行、五運、六氣、表裏、升降、浮沉、……等等，都是中醫理論的出發點，但是這種名詞，便是「玄學的」產物，（不過也不能代表整個玄學的一切）由此推想演繹而來的，那就是「玄說」了。試看歷來的中醫書籍，無論生理、病症、藥性、治效、都是用這種術語來解說的，所以中醫的理論，是「玄說」，也就無可吾認，陸某在他的「經騐與玄學」一文中，却大放厥詞，有云：　　「什麽呌玄學，中醫怎麽會是玄學的，翻一翻辭源，玄學就是道家之學，這當然與中醫毫無關係，另一條即Meta-physiscs，一名形而上學，這又弄到哲學的範圍方面去了，我們知道形而上學，就是第一哲學，……我都弄不懂，我們中醫和這個又有什麽關聯。……」　　陸某此語，是針對着范守淵先生在人民醫刋中曾說中醫是玄學的話而發的；是的，中醫並不是哲學的，而且醫學的對象是「人」，人是有形有質的東西，當然不是「形而上的」，自然不能而且也不該用「形而上一的方法推想他，研究他，但是陸某刦是顯然忽略了「玄學」解說的另一方面了。說中醫不是「全部的玄學」是可以的，可是「玄學」的另一解釋，是道家之說，這却不能說與中醫毫無關聯，中醫理論，受道流影響甚深，這是事實，而且陰陽五行生尅等等術語，爲中醫基礎理論的根據，就拿黃帝內經來說，其中多半有道流的氣息，一直到現在，中醫方案中，還常常用着的理論，都是這種「率說」的化身，你還能說這種道流的「率說」，和中醫章沒有關聯嗎？請你不要數典忘社，這種「玄說」，却是中醫的始祖呢！我却怪范先生說：「中醫是玄學」，已經是看得起中醫了，（其實中醫的理論，還不够代表全部的玄學。）以致引起了陸某借題發揮，而說到哲學的形而上學去。醫學旣是「人」的「科學」，形而上學的領域中，是不許有「醫學」之存在的；其實中醫的理論，是虛無渺茫的空想，所以這種「玄說」，不是科學，也不是哲學，連一玄學」的資格，都還不够，我上面已經說過，人是有形有質的，關於人的生現病理的一切，也決不是靠「玄學」所能解決的，這裏也可為「中醫是什麽」，作一部份的解答吧！　　其次:中醫所依據的，就是所謂「經騐」了。從前的中醫界總說中醫是哲學的，或中醫是科學的，現在已經有了自覺，這種觀念是不對的，而且中醫的臨診，本來也可以撇開「玄說」的理論不談，那麼憑了什麼，來辨症施治呢？就只好說是運用「經騐」，而且十分誇張「經騐的」成就，想與科學相抗衡。要說中醫的本質，原是從經騐而來，經騐是可貴的，而且特別將張中醫是「經騐的」，這個說法，還是在近幾十年才盛行，因爲依附什麽哲　，科學，藝術，都不行了，但是大家不要忽略了「經騐」的本質，我們中醫文獻中從來就找不出說中醫是「經騐的」產物這個話，有之，只有幾十種方書，有時標了什麽「經騐良方」「經騐方」的書名，但是這種「騐方，」由於前人隨手集錄，實際上並不是全部效騐的；別的醫經中恐怕就不大找得到「經驗」兩字的影子吧！然而單單靠着幾個書名，是不能作爲中醫是「經騐的」之論據的，大家都曉得這個所謂經驗良方的說法，只不過是說經過有人試用的方劑罷了，也不値什麼大驚小怪，欣喜若狂的，實際上「騐方」不十分有騐，已是盡人皆知之事，我眞不懂，說中醫是「經騐的」，又有什麽光榮之處。不過話要說回來，他們說的「經騐」，却不是指「經騐良方」的經騐，而是附會到哲學的「經騐論」上去了，並且以爲中醫的一切，都是「經騐的」，並不單單指方藥一端，所以可貴不錯，照理經騐應該是可貴的，望文生義，一望而知，何須辨解，但是我們尋常所說的「經騐」，譬如說某人辦事有經騐，無論社交方面，或按術方面，這都屬於個人的「經歷」並不是學問，也不含有絕對可靠或「錄騐」的意義。至於哲學上的「經騐」一詞，都昌從西文翻譯而來的，便有兩種解釋：從前的經騐論，就是指「親身經歷其事，以晋人之感覺，直接認取之對象」的主觀經騐論而言；但是現在新哲學理論，是「由觀察客覜現實中的現象，或由人工設定條件，在實騐室實騐所要研究的現象，而得到的知識，就是經騐」，換方之，也就是實騐的結果，才是眞的經騐。我們曉得西文Experiment一字，也譯作「經騐」；余雲岫先生說過經騐是主觀的，陸君就來反駁他說：也有基於觀察和實騐的「經騐」，確實余先生在他論經騐文中，沒有提到經騐的另一解釋，是其缺點，也是他一時行文的疏忽，我們決不能就此說他不曉得西文經騐原文的另一個意義；余先生既以主觀的經騐立論，故謂經騐不足貴，而徒恃經騐以爲技術者，庸庸不足數，然以未言經騐，盡可廢棄，可謂公允之論。（待續）</p>

<p>春秋分離  匈牙利F.Molnar著　嚴大椿譯　　在公園裏一條遠離的小徑上有一個男子和一位婦人在徘徊着。　　她　現在可以結束了。分別的時候到了。我們沒有要做的事了。請你吻我底手罷，我們來友誼的分離罷。　　他　照你的話辦罷。　　她　巴斯泰！我們除了各人保持那些最快樂最親密的回憶之外，不需要什麽。我們曾經會晤過，相愛過，短促地親吻過，而現在，我們雙方厭倦了。　　他　你說得很對。（他吻她底手）　　她　我要取着右首的小徑離去了。你稍爲等一下，從左首的小徑離去。現在我們旣然是永別了，再呌我的丈夫撞見我們一同出去，未免太過分了。　　他　再會！（他倆誰都不動身）　　她　你爲什麼不走？　　他　在先，我有一點事要問問你。　　她　什麼？　　他　你記得嗎？我第一次遇見你時，你是在霍亨搭脫拉。你同了幾個女朋友在一起，在那裏度冬。你的丈夫不在身邊，所以那時我沒有遇見他。　　她　我記得是如此。　　他　你一定回想得到，我們立刻互相鍾情起來。稍遲，我倆在帕達貝斯脫繼續我們的親密，在那裏，我仍舊沒有見過你的丈夫。　　她　沒有。　　他　可是有一天你帶給我一張照片，是一個美男子的照。你說：「我帶給你一張丈夫的照相。我曉得你一定想知道他生得怎樣。」我把照片仔仔細細地端詳一番，那上的男子生得如道蓮格萊那般美，像愛多亞七世那樣文雅。他底頭髮是捲曲的，他底眉毛構成好看的半圓形，他底目光懇摯而正直，並且還有一張像希臘神仙的嘴。我沒有吿訴你，那晚我一口東西都沒有吃。　　她　我也猜想得到的。　　他　並且我還睡不熟。那時，我正在在戀着你，相比之下那裏甘心把自己屈辱呢。於是，我在鏡子裏十分殷切地細察自己底相貌。我自知生得不美不醜，恰正是一張普通面孔。這種面孔，你在隨便那個副官身上看得到的。我見了這付面孔，很煩惱，很生氣。我打定主意用種種方法一定把它改造得好看。　　她　我留意到這上。　　他　在那些不眠的晚上，我常常向自己詢問，你旣然有了這樣一個美丈夫，怎麼還會看中我？我如此安慰自己：「也許她的丈夫是一個呆子。」於是我再做着更遠的分析，承認自己底智慧並不超過衆人，何况照片上的面相留着一點聰明的痕跡。我簡直不明白你怎麼會愛上我的。我嫉忌，嫉忌照上的男子，所以我漸漸地踏入與照片熟烈地競爭的境界。　　她　我知道你會如此。　　他　我呌最好的裁縫做衣服，呌最好的理髮匠燙曲頭髮。每秒鐘都瘋在地嫉忌着。我細心注意自己外表上的任何一個細節，務求達到美觀的地步。有時，你吿訴我要同丈夫去赴跳舞會，一想到他穿了夜禮服，多麽軒昂，就使我氣得發昏。　　她　我料到你會如此。　　他　每逢你自由的時候，我總要求你和我在一起。你記得嗎？有一次，你吿訴我你的丈夫到倫敦去做生意，要隔二星期回來。我簡直一刻功夫都不讓你　　離開我的眼睛。　　她　的確，他曾經到倫敦去。　　他　當你報吿我，他已經回來時，我要求你有機會讓我會會他，你拒絕了。我不過想趁他在的時候見一面，可是你拒絕了。於是事情發生了。　　她　什麼？　　他　現在我可以向你實說了。有一天下午，你在我寓所裘，從錢袋裏掉下一張字條。你走後，我拾起來一看，是寫給令堂的，上面說：你的丈夫和你明晚在歌劇院定了一個包廂，明晚經過她的寓所時，帶她一同去看戲。你是要把字條送給令堂的，可是不留意落在我的家裏了。　　她　眞的麼？我將它遺失在你家裏的嗎？　　他　眞的。翌日晚上，自然，我也到歌劇院去看戲。我看見你們——你，令堂和你的丈夫——都坐在包廂裏。　　她　你也去麼？　　他　你想說的單是這一句話麼？　　她　你還期望我說些什麽呀？他不要裝腔罷。我來說下去，那晚我在歌劇院裏發現——我不敢說你騙我——一點錯誤。你的美大約有五十歲至五十五歲年紀，生得難信的醜，佝僂，毛髮蓬鬆，恕我說實話，他實在生得無可形容的醜。　　她　吓……吓……　　他　你不會否認他是你的丈夫。　　她　不否認。　　他　爲了確實起見，我還打聽認識的朋友。　　她　他是我的丈夫。　　他　好了，那麽，你爲什麽同我玩這個喜劇呢？你給我的照相上的那個漂亮少年倒底是誰？　　她　我不知道。那張照片是我在倫敦，化了幾個先令買來的。我猜也許是什麽英國貴族吧。　　他　怎麽？　　她　你自己去答這個問題罷。這是我的詭計，是一個成功的小詭計。你開始和照片競爭時，你昇高了百分之五十的價値。你無可形容地把自己改好。那張照相將你造成了一個美男子，又文雅又聰明。所以我很愛你。來改良你底品性，在我是一種喜悅。　　他　眞聰明我我願意你這樣做。這眞是典型女性的智巧。可是你要曉得，太疏忽了。　　她　這怎麽講？　　他　你瞧，因爲一個不謹愼，把一張字條無心地從錢袋裏落出來，破毀了由謊話造成的完好無疵的聯姻。我看見你的丈夫——你的眞丈夫——的那天，我知道你在向我撒謊，我爲了你把自已弄成引人可愛的那種振奮，就此完全失去。我無需再留心那些事情，我自己誇獎着自己，你的丈夫較我卑微。因此，我漸漸地忽略我的外表了。我的嫉忌也減除了。自愛的心開始冷淡下去。結果，把愛都毀滅掉。如果你沒有落下那張字條，我一定至今還在戀着你呢。　　她　（柔和地）那麼，你相信像我這樣的婦人會把一張字條無意地落在你家裏的嗎？　　他　這話什麼意思？　　她　一個會欺騙丈夫的婦人，對於字條是極當心的。假使，我有了這種疏忽，我的丈夫早已找出我有外遇了。　　他　你的意思是故意掉下那張字條的？　　她　當然。　　他　（忿怒地）爲什麼？　　她　這個問題也請你自己去回答罷。我有意要你看見我的丈夫，好使你慢慢地冷淡下去，直到弄得你十分冷淡爲止。因爲我素來痛恨裝模作態。當我對你厭倦時，我便掉下了那張字條。於是你對於我消失了興趣，我們的親眤可以有一個自然的，和平的，友誼的結束。　　他　你要結束它，完全爲了……　　她　我早已打定主意還要把那張英國美少年的照片送給另外一個相仿的男子。朋友，再會罷。不要忿怒。有些人底心應該如此操縱的：同時拿着一張照片和一張字條。正如莫泊桑在「人心」裏所說的。再會！　　他凝思着注視她取着右首的小徑走去，在轉灣處消失。風景  戴朗　　戴朗Ancire　Derain1880——，是現代法籣西　壇三大家之一，自從塞尙死後，他與卞卡索等從事立體運動，直至今日，畫風數變，無論風景，人物，靜物，其構圖均異常緊密，色彩變化無窮，筆調古拙，感覺渾厚具大家風度，此作是爲莫洛可某歌劇院所繪佈景之草圖，與平時作品趣味各異，倘無簽名，幾莫能辯。（獅）紀念于院長右任七十大慶　籌建民治大禮堂緣起　　監察院院長于右任氏，明年七十大慶，京中同志初議爲其建立右任圖書館於西安，嗣爲于氏所阻，乃別爲籌建民治大禮堂，藉昭景慕，茲探錄其緣起及補記於後。（記者）　　（緣起）　　「耕牧河山願朱酬，渡江亡命作春秋；　　今年偶遇勞工節，做炮孤兒已白頭」。　　「認降之年罹百憂，中山世系削琉球；　　同盟爭起全人類，不獨歌呼爲亞洲」。　　右二詩，是于右任先生六十七歲壽辰在重慶作的，也就是先生的自傳。由此我們知道先生幼年即懷着耕牧河山的大志，並做過代表中華民族在最虔敬時或最快樂時的場音的爆竹工人，而至今猶不獨歌呼爲亞洲也。先生的勳業文章，是中華民族史上最光榮的一頁。先生標準草書的倡導，尤負着新國家建設的重大使命。先生是一爲人生而藝術」者。先生頭雖白了，而先生的精神則永遠站在我們的前面；靑年人見了先生，感情益爲檄越；老年人見了先生，恢復了他的靑春；病者，弱者見了先生，增加了他們奮鬥的勇氣。先生的康强，不但不似老人，而且有過於壯年人，這象徵了古老偉大的中華民族萬壽無疆——明年是先生七十大慶。先生近曾有函致陝西友人說：「近來對於地方文化事業甚少致力，欲於此埀老之年設立一靖國圖書館」，設立靖國圖書館，是先生對地方文化的關懷，而我們則應如何奮力於事業，以酬答此時代偉人的衷愛與紀念呢？我們要在陝西西安建立一偉大的右任圖書館，並在　北漢南建立兩個分館。也就是以先生壽世之心爲先生壽！並以爭起全人類的心，來完成我們的計劃。敬祈當代鉅公，社會賢達，賜予我們以有力的協助！謹啓。　　（補記）　　右啓，先生聞而急止之，並吿以「政府將於西安建國立圖書館，規模宏大，諸公高誼，余已深感，但希勿於國家多難之際，爲此重複之事業」。同仁歸而協議，以先生之意，固不可違，而吾人則更宜有所表達，僉以先生自民國八年，於三原西關創立民治學校，茲後所有財力，咸用於學校之設施，故先生在陝無恒產，每歸即以學校爲家庭，迄今中小學畢業者，可五千餘人，或致力敎育，或服務社會，亦皆能恪守先生革命精神，艱苦奮鬥。先生曾擬爲學校建大禮堂，數年經劃，磚木旣備，而以抗戰中輟。喪亂以來，舊所儲材，失遺殆盡，先生時爲耿耿。同仁等以爲民治學校，乃先生在西北領導革命之紀念地，並將永爲西北革命意識之精神堡壘。先生個人苦心支持，從未向國家請求援助，而一禮堂之築，遲遲至今，雖先生不言，而世之敬愛先生者，不知則已，知而不有以促其成，匪獨心所難安，而亦義不容辭也，乃共議將前啓建立右任圖書館者，改爲民治大禮堂，謹爲斯記於啓末，尙祈公鑒。秦淮三日詩  陳寶驊　　玄武湖光浩氣淸，朱橋素艇解多情；臥看紅袖敲輕獎，彷彿凌虛天上行。　　臺城南畔把魂招，是處鷄鳴認六朝；今日我來烽刦後，倚樓閒品太平簫。　　漫步岡郊白日斜，珠光鬢影鬥風華；題橋心事山盟在，竝看紅梅一樹花。　　千秋偉業與天同，仰望崇高只爲公；小立陵階唯默默，滿山花樹趁柔風。　　一片淸凉掃葉樓，今人不與古人憂；漢西門外崎嶇路，幾見鈿車到莫愁。　　堤邊楊柳綠烟新，三日秦淮一段春；爲問黃鸝能會意，臨風佇立是何人？夜話  谷流　　當濃密的夜色，灌滿小屋，灌滿院落，灌滿整個世界……　　一朶一朶的燈火的花，便一片一片的開放。　　邁動　疲乏的酸痛的腿，趕路的人，對於在眼前，在路的盡頭閃現掛來的一粒燈火，有大喜悅……　　不單是耀路的人，所有的人都喜愛燈火：白髮的老母親，喜愛在一盞油燈下，輪轉着紡車；孩子們喜愛燈火在粉壁上映出的手影，或在燈下聽姐姐講說一個又一個美麗的童話；學生們喜愛在燈前，誦讀功課；靑年男女們，喜愛伴守着燈火，以激動的心情寫出一行一行的熱情……　　那以日光照亮的，那以螢火虫照亮的，那把牆開一個洞借鄰居的燈光照亮的人，對於燈的單戀，該有多麽熾熱，該有多麼深沉！　　呵！燈！你爲什麼在漂亮的房間裏，浪費你的血液，而對低矮的小土屋，又是這麼小氣？　　我明白了，對着沉靜的在黑夜裏服役的燈火，我彷彿聽到了解答：第一位發明燈的人，沒有偏心！燈，沒有偏心！……一寸山河一寸血313  葉勁風　　「那麼，爲什麼不請他們參加我們這個組織？」鶴見認爲他的組織，最合這個動盪時局的需要；只要是人才，他都想拉攏。何黨沒有試探過？」　　「他們不贊成？」鶴見焦切地問。　　「不，因爲他們不顧參加任何團體。他們有一個固定的計劃，分三個步驟實行：一，先把第一單位新村促進成功；二，把鍊練成功的人，分成許多小組，向各地窮鄕僻壤，建設許多新村單位；三，向邊疆發展？……　　「假如日本人不讓他們發展呢？」　　「……？」正岩不懂鶴見這句話的命意。　　「我是說，假使這次大舉登陸，中國勢必弄得屍骨遍地，血流成河，還組織什麼新村？」　　「哦……！」正岩明白了，一這，我還不大淸楚，必須向他們請敎。可是……他們大約也肯從旁盡力吧……譬如……」　　「譬如什麼？」鶴見一句緊似一句，好像考問正岩似的。　　「譬如這次宮崎貞夫的玩藝，全虧我那朋友隻手辦理哩。……還聽說他們曾經自動到應山去，破過假代表案件，剷除了當地土劣替日人做鷹犬的勾當；南京大使館的別動組織新書社，也被他們消滅過一次……由這些舉動着，假使眞有大舉登陸的這回事，他們恐怕不會袖手旁觀吧。……」　　「很好，不過我認爲大家應該合作作…好罷，我決定要請見你那位貴友一下，叨敎叨敎！」　　（關於百忍莊的抗敵舉動，題名「海屋劍客羣，」在「旅行雜誌」中速期刊載——筆者。）　　「……車子來了！」房門曳開了一角，露出那位下女的面孔。　　「哦……！」鶴見的心神，被正岩的故事，完全吸收住了，下女悄悄的動作，竟沒注意到。她的下半句，「車子來了」，把鶴見的心思，從幻想中攝了回來。「……請那駛車夫到這裏來罷。」　　車夫是個普通勤勞階級的人，雖不十分粗魯，却生得一副吃生米的啞吧面孔。見了鶴見，倒是很懂規矩，三個九十度鞠躬之外，還有一套問安等等的祝誦。　　「早上那位中村小姐，是你送到大使館去的？」鶴見劈頭審問那車夫了。　　「是，是，老爺；愚下駕駛御奉行的」。車夫的下等語句，滲雜着上等的文言，弄成了一種四不像。　　「時刻記得嗎？」　　「是，八點三十五分起行，八點四十五分到達，共計一圓二十錢，照零碎貸金御用計算。」　　「後來呢？」　　「是，……御虛候十五分鐘。外灘行，到達華懋飯店，九時十分正，車駱擁擠之故，共計二圓四十錢，御虛候，御行駛，御案內，通常貸金計算。」布蘭德斯厭客  沈思　　布蘭德斯（Geory　Morris　Cohen　Brades　1842-1927）是丹麥著名的文藝史家批評家，也有人稱他爲世界上最偉大的評論家。可是，他很不願意接見客人，他在美國遊歷的時候，寓所裏的電話電鈴，一天到晚，總是響側不休而不去理會它。又一次，在丹麥京城，美國一位大小說家德萊賽（Theodore　Dreiser）去訪問他，坐了二個多鐘頭，他老先生才說了一句話。狗　　當燈火閃動的時候，狗的吠呌聲，便聯綴成一片。　　狗，是夜的衛士，是對燈火狂吠，而表示自己的忠實的動　　我趕過許多夜路，當我的精力，被一天的行程所折磨凈盡時，我對於黑夜裹的突然的狗吠，感到驚慌，也感到欣慰。　　我討厭把一切人都看作盜賊的狗，除了自已的主子（也許自己的主子，就是一個强盜！）對於任何打從牠旁邊走過的人，往往是善良的人，都狂吠一陣，都想撲到他的脚下，咬兩口，這是一種無理的割據！街道，是屬於每一個有脚的人的。　　然而，漫長的夜路，沒盡頭的夜路，對於一個趕路的人，却又是多麽大的折磨呵！當你一步比一步邁得沉重，當你迫切的需要一間茅草小店的時候，突然傳來的一聲狗吠，竟反常的顯得是那麽溫暖，那麽親切！一聲狗吠，便會抖掉你一身的疲勞。　　而狗，不要怕牠，狗是頂沒有出息的動物！一聽見脚步聲，咳嗽聲！或者是看見一星燈火，便會吠呌起來。但是，用一根手杖，用一塊石頭，都是可以把這傢伙擊退的。狗，軟的欺，硬的怕，躱避不是辦法，越躱牠，牠越兇；放大胆子前進，狗擱擋不了我們的去路。自由談功能勳以下  報童　　你總難想像一個衣衫襤褸兵不像兵，民不像民的人，就是八百壯士中的一員吧，自然你也難以想象一個面帶菜色的小販，或是疲困的苦力就是昔日雄踞四行倉庫的孤軍。因爲這太難想像了，一個戰士和一個苦力小販或失業者，這之間實在聯想不起來，即使是一個最豐富的想像家，他也將拒絕道種不大愉快的想像吧。　　在上海，你當然記得起這偉大的一幕，你也許竹經隔江眺望過在衆多的日章旗中飛舞的國旗。現在呢，四行倉庫在良好的修砌後仍巍然的站在蘇州河旁，而八百壯士呢，他們，也許洗離在道倉庫的四圍，被人們所全然遣忘了。　　當我們讀到那麼多關於他國土兵復員的辦法和執行情形的報導後，當我們聽到美國在華尋覓兵員屍骨的認眞的工作狀况，與我們看到街頭售賣着的那麼衆多質佳味美的軍用食品或其他用品時，總有一個希望，能够讓這些戰士們安然的生活和安然的復員。　　道是很不幸的一種印象，當一個乞丐向你求乞而說明他是一個打了八年仗過來的人，當一個服裝破舊的兵士向你求助而示意他就是十年前的孤軍。我們也許可以給他一點錢，然而仍不能令我們精神上全皆釋然。因爲，你會覺得道不是最適當的對一個保衛國家的戰士，應有的帮助和感謝。　　可是我們僅僅能够做到這樣，其餘能够支付的祗有一片同情了。　　在報紙上，我們常常看到謝團長夫人的呼籲，她和若干孤軍日日在斷炊的威脅下，而且求爲碼頭工人亦尙不可得。其實，讓一個有功勳的人去作碼頭工人已經是令人不可忍受了，竟至不可得，那是不大容易理解的問題。　　我們的社會的視綫還存留在證券和貨價，我們社會人士的興趣仍集中在舞應和歌塲，自然，一點微弱的聲息易被淹沒，一件此地的往事也易被遺忘了。　　也許爲了這樣的緣故，人們不重視榮譽、而重視金錢，不重視義務，而重視報酬，因爲後者能保障生活。然而這樣的觀念，會促成多少澆薄的世態。　　不此之圖，更將何以勵後之來者？張約園遺書  聯　　張壽鏞字伯頌，號詠霓，別署約園，浙江鄞縣人，以附貢生中式光緒癸卯科順天鄕試舉人；民國肇建，歷任江蘇，浙江，湖北財政廳廳長，滬海道道尹，國民政府財政部次長，兼江蘇財政廳廳長；創辦光華大學，任校長，成材甚衆，晚年罷官潛心著述，編刻四明叢書，表章先賢，「民國卅四年卒，國府傳令褒揚，並將生平事蹟存備宣付國史。　　約園一生道德思想事業文章，足爲現代學者之模範，其遺書可分爲：所著，所輯，所刻三類，茲將書目列舉如次：　　（一）所著之書已刋行者，有詩史初稿，約園演講集，史學大綱，諸子大綱，約園雜著初編，續編，（三）編，游蜀草，計七種。尙未刋行者，有文學大綱，經學大綱，四明經籍志三種，及雜錄數種。　　（二）所輯之書已刋行者，有曹放齊詩說，虞秘　集，賀秘監遺書，（馮貞羣同輯）孫拾遺文集，豐淸敏公遺書，定川遺書，陳忠貞公遣盡計七種。未刋行者，有舒嬾堂詩文存一種，及其他未完稿者多種。　　（三）所刻之書，有說文解字部首一卷，鄉諺證古四卷附錄一卷，寸草廬奏稿二卷，明本釋三卷，四明叢書第一集至第七集一百五十六種一千零八十卷。已刻而未印行者，有四明叢書第八集約十種。　　四明叢書之編印，爲約園一生精力所薈萃。民國之初即已發願積，廿年之繼續努力，網羅四明遺典，表章忠義，每一集必有總序後序，每一書必有序或序跋兼有，故其所刻印，實有裨於世道人心，不獨保存鄕邦文獻也。約園初賴刋行十集，已刋行者有七集，捐館之時第八集二十種，有十種已刻成，其餘十種寫稿已成，其子孫正謀完成遣志，繼續刻印，並請原助約圖編印之郵縣馮貞羣先生（孟　）指導，年內或可將第八集刻行問世。補票  毛景初　　她帶了她的孩子跳上了公共汽車，只買了一張車票。　　「這孩子也要買票的！」賣票員說。　　「但是他只有三歲哩！」她辯護着。　　「我看上去，他至少有六歲了。」　　「但是你必須知道，我結婚到現在還不過四年呢！」　　「對不起，太太，我只請求你補一張票，並不需要你的懺悔呀！」「迎春曲」四主角自左至右：金燄，胡　，裴冲（立者），劉瓊。介紹：「燕京新聞」  鏗鏘　　「燕京新聞」是燕京大學新聞系的實騐性刋物，由於主持人的認眞，所以它的每一期都可以說是非常精彩。在編排這方面它有令人不順眼的地方，每一個標題的大小，廣吿的安排，以及花邊的分配等都能做到恰到好處，簡直使人不相信那是一塊實習的園地。　　在內容方面「燕京新聞」也是充實而生氣蓬勃的，它的第一版是重要的學校新聞和學生小論壇。第二版是次要的學校新聞，每週小言，和人物誌，采風錄。第三版略偏於文藝性的副葉。第四版是瑣碎的學校新聞，論專，特寫，和大家談。從新聞的論調上看起來似乎路爲有點自由主義色彩，和大學生的身份說得上「恰當」二個字。至於　葉這方面可以說是精華的所在，經常的能够一篇詩，一篇雜文，一篇短篇小說或者散文，時常在上面露臉的作者有方非，禾成，馬伯力，于谷，楊匯，西門鐸，牛濡沫等，雖然這幾個名字或許是並不爲人熟悉的，但是從他們輕鬆的筆調和充溢字裏行間的生氣看來，我可以斷定他們的寫作是有前途的。秘訣  果　　少年醫學博士：「爸爸，我要掛牌了，請敎成功之道。」　　老年醫學博士：「藥方開得自己也看不淸，賬單開得明明白白，從此吃着不盡了。」　　現在，時時刻刻爲着「閉門家裘坐，禍從天上來」而担憂者，恐大有人在幻想空中浮泊機的陳德馨先生，就是量好的例子。因此到馬路上去走走，看着風馳電掣的車輛往來，偶不小心，就可變成輪下鬼的禍事，經常可見，如平凉路上被流彈　斃的孫才生，可算是「禍從天上來」的例子之一。　　好在孫才生是不會白死的，撤查眞相的負責當局，不是對記者說過：「衝突原因，純係雙方誤會所致，所値得研究者，爲孫才生究係何方所誤擊云云」。「斃人者人必斃之」，我們祗要天天看報，自然會知道的。　　但我却因此事而想起剛讀過的兪曲園隨筆中，有錄沈蓮溪閉門書所憶一則云：「余初人刑部見一案，因被毆，格回毆者之械誤傷一旁人致斃，罪坐格者。余心疑之，夫格者不能不格，而毆者可以不毆，何以不坐毆者，且毆者志在傷人，而格者僅圖自免，今不格則死於械，格而又死於法，其情不可原手？因具說帖上之，旋由律例館議准，改坐毆者，遂著爲成例。」　　雖然孫案內情，遠較此事爲複雜，但道理還是一個，果如當局所示「究係何方所誤擊」而祗予誤擊者以嚴辦，不若撤查衝突經過，嚴辦肇事禍首爲公。　　吳人妄蓋，敬此而止。影譚「彩虹曲」  胡訥　　看過「幻想曲」和「幻遊南海」二張卡通影片以後　　卡通片在走着一條新的途從；前者以八大名曲爲題材，完成了一部有意義的音樂卡通片；後者又利用人和卡通一同出現在銀冪上。所以，這二部影片使卡通奠定了新的基礎。　　「彩虹曲」是華德狄斯耐氏又一新作品，和「幻想曲」是同一範疇的片子。全片分成爲十個小節，包含着舞蹈，音樂，與不同的形式。　　全片以「雙人舞」最爲出色：由狄娜蕭主唱，此節的色彩配得非常佳。「滿塲飛」介紹新型的舞踴，配上輕鬆的音樂，聲面的展開亦非常別緻。　　「藍色的海灣」和「周　」是以幽靜見長，前者以　來描寫藍色海灣幽靜的美，後者以　做引綫，拉開想思的窗戶。　　「瑪西族和考埃族」，「帽體」，「彼得捕狼」，「鯨魚歌王」，都是屬於幻想性的故事，比較以「彼得捕狼」有意義！衆志成城；「鯨魚歌王」音樂與歌唱非常好。　　「棒球大王」是　刺，說帽者必敗。「惜別」說樂器，無甚特徹。　　「彩虹曲」中音樂是成功的，全片都以音樂爲靈魂；即若色彩艷麗，也非常可愛而悅目。　　如果我們拿「彩虹曲」與「幻想曲」比較，那前者沒有後者好，我以爲。藝文壇　　「聯合晚報」的總經理劉尊栱氏，近正辦理出國護照的手續，辦理完竣後，即往美國。行期大約定爲一年。（永）　　文化生活出版社日昨出書六種：托爾斯泰「幼年，少年，靑年」（高植譯），柏克受「獄中記」（巴金譯），屠格涅夫「靜靜的河流」（趙蔚靑譯），拜爾納「瑪婷」（春柯譯），田濤「沃土」，巴金「長生塔」等。田漢曾自無錫轉道杭州游覽多日，甫於日前抵滬。最近擬將「琵琶行」一劇趕寫完成後，再度赴杭州一　　此次由杭州返滬之出漢，曾攜帶平劇角色之泥製面譜數十枚，內有關公，張飛等頭像，色彩新鮮，頗爲名貴。最近田氏將數十面譜縣掛於其書齋之四圍壁上，令人進入室內，即感到戲劇空氣異常濃厚。（記者）　　豐子愷在大後方八年裏所作的漫畫，共有二百六十幅，曾在重慶，漢口，上海，無錫等地展覽。萬棄書店將其全部藏書的精粹部分，共三十六幅，彩色精神一巨册，業己出版。聞將不久絨印第二集。（勤）一個日本讀者的來信　——關於蘇峯與蘆花  芥子　　張冠李戴，易鬧覺扭，此次爲了一篇小文（「八十三年非」），蒙小川貞之先生來信指敎，感到非常的榮幸而且歉愧，使我有機會來一個糾正，尤應表示我對他的感激。　　筆者在四月八日日本二三事專頁上發表了「八十三年非」之後，小川先生當即由報館轉來一信，大意如次：　　「鄙人是一個留用日本人，平日非常愛讀貴報，今天（四月八日）讀到日本二三事專頁中所記述的「八十三年非」，希望貴刋能予以注意，不過該文僅有一點「誤記」，茲特提出來。該文說「享有盛名的老作家德富蘇峯，又名廬花，八十三歲。」其實，蘇峯與蘆花（誤植爲廬花）並不是一個人，而是兩兄第。兄蘇峯，嫻熟歷史，擅長政論；弟蘆花，即「不如歸」作者，精於純文學，兄弟二人，共享盛名。但二人之間，因意見互異，情感交惡，陷入永年絕交狀態。直到一九二七年蘆花臨終之際，蘇峯再也不忍長期固執下去，便毅然決然作了一次「枕邊會」，去跟他的弟弟蘆花言歸於好。道一段史實，迄今傳爲文壇佳話。誤記這件事實固然是極細小的，不過他們兩人之間意見不同，爲了使貴國的日本研究者閱　他們的著作時避免誤會起見，特草數語，藉供參考。多謝，並恕冒昧！小川貞之。」　　譯完了前函，除表示我對小川氏熱心指敎外，我還得承認這是由於我記憶上的不正確所造的錯誤。該文僅在閱讀朝日新聞法庭記者團所述「東京審判」一書後匆匆草就，未暇參考他書，倘無小川氏來信糾正，這個錯誤也許就糾纏不淸吧。再者，日文版原書由將「血淚爲誰揮」一句中之「揮」字，誤刋爲「振」字，這在筆者的小文裏是加以訂正了的，這一點也許是我可以吿慰於原作渚蘇峯的吧。危城記  秦瘦鷗　　這會兒，他才想到蘭和緋緋榮兒今天傍晚預定再要上車站去試一次

<h3>Heavy Fighting on the Shaanxi-Jin Border; Communist Forces Intensify Harassment in Chahar and Suiyuan, Attempting to Open a Communication Line with Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] From the four-corner area of Suide, Mizhi, Wubu, and Jiaxian in northern Shaanxi, the communist forces are making their last stand in the midst of battle. Wubu City was stormed by the Nationalist army on the morning of the 9th, with fierce street fighting. Suide and Mizhi continued to experience mixed fighting inside and outside the city until the 9th, with intense back-and-forth assaults on various strongholds. Most of the important outposts surrounding the two counties are under the control of the Nationalist army. There is heavy fighting in the mountainous areas below, and sporadic fighting in Hejiachuan, Guojiachuan, and Xuejiamao east of Suide. A communist artillery battalion was heavily bombed by the air force on the afternoon of the 9th while crossing the river into Jin from Jun Ferry.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 10th] It is reported that the remaining communist forces in northern Shaanxi are currently under the command of He Long, Wang Zhen, and He Jinnian, each responsible for different areas. He Long is responsible for the Fu County and Xihuachi area. Wang Zhen is hiding in Liujia Street southwest of Anding. He Jinnian is north of Wayaobao. The Communist 359th Brigade and Jiaoyun Brigade have fled to the northwest of Qingjian, and the 358th Brigade is northwest of Panlong Town. In addition, the remaining communist forces within the territory of Etuok Banner south of Suiyuan and near Yanchi have been completely cleared. Gu Shoushan, the puppet commander of Etuok Banner, and many senior personnel have been captured alive, and a large number of war spoils have been seized.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] The Nationalist army in northern Shaanxi is advancing on Jingbian from the west, south, and north. Ma Hongbin's troops reached Liulinjian on the 9th. The Nationalist army descending from south of Suiyuan crossed Xiaoqiaopan into Shaanxi on the 9th and approached Ningtiaoliang north of Jingbian in the afternoon. The troops advancing north from Bao'an continued to occupy Wuqibao south of Jingbian. Within days, the three routes will converge on Jingbian. In addition, the Nationalist army advancing west from Yulin advanced to Wujiabao east of Hengshan on the morning of the 9th and continued to press towards Hengshan. [Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th] Communist military and political cadres and their families who escaped from Yan'an are now fleeing to Xing County, Ningwu, Wuzhai, Kelan, and other counties. The Bao Yan Column, with more than 2,000 troops, based in Mizhi and Fuguxian, crossed east from Luoyukou southwest of Xing County and infiltrated the vicinity of Xing County. Their Guard 1st, 2nd, 3rd Brigades, the newly formed 4th and 6th Brigades, and the 6th Cavalry Division, totaling more than 17,000 troops, crossed east from the Hegu and Linzheyu crossings southwest of Baode, fleeing to Baode, Kelan, and other places.</p>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 9th] The communist forces captured Jishan on the 8th and Hejin on the 9th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th] Communist forces have recently launched offensives from both the east and south of Suiyuan, attempting to control the western section of the Ping-Sui Railway and seize control of Jining in order to open a communication line with Outer Mongolia. Zhang Zongxun, commander of the Suiyuan South, and Haicelong, deputy commander of the Inner Mongolia Liberation Army, led a portion of the communist forces and cooperated with troops from the Beida Qingshan Military Region of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, totaling more than 80,000 troops, to invade Qingshuihe, Tuoketuo, Helin, and other counties south of Suiyuan. Yao Shan, commander of the Suiyuan East, and Huang Xingwu, deputy commander, attacked Haozhen and Jining from the northwest of Datong, with the 2nd Brigade of the Sui-Meng Military Region, Kang Fumin, and other units as the main force, and the Jin-Sui area as a light force, numbering 50,000 in total.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 10th] Since the Nationalist army began its suppression campaign, the Communist Jin-Sui Military Region has actively launched conscription work in the "Liberated Areas," conscripting all able-bodied men aged 16 to 40. It is estimated that 200,000 troops will be conscripted in northwestern Jin and northern Yanmen. 100,000 will supplement the regular army, and 100,000 will cooperate with the guerrillas. A large number of political work cadres have been transferred from the Taihang and Lüliang Military Regions and are undergoing intensive training in Shuoxian, Pianguan, Jiwu, and other places. Participants are all tightly tied around the waist with long ropes to prevent escape.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] Ma Zhanshan has decided to go to the Northeast to take up his post, with the departure date approximately ten days from now. Yesterday, Northeast students in Beiping held a farewell for Ma. Ma's troops are currently guarding Chicheng, Longmen, Dushikou, Pingdingbao, and other areas in eastern Chahar, and it will be difficult to enter the Northeast in the short term.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 10th] The remaining communist forces on the border of Chahar and Suiyuan have intensified their harassment in recent days, attempting to contain the Nationalist army's advance into northwestern Jin. (1) On the morning of the 8th, more than 2,000 communist troops infiltrated Pingdingbao in northeastern Chahar and engaged in fierce fighting with the Nationalist army. (2) In Fansubao (southwest of Huailai) in southern Chahar, fierce fighting lasted for two days. The Nationalist army used the strategy of "retreating to attack again," inflicting heavy casualties on the communist forces and still maintaining control of the fort. (3) More than 1,000 communist cavalry who had infiltrated Zhuozishan and Huitengliang in Suiyuan were tracked and suppressed by the Nationalist army and fled to the northeastern Mongolian grasslands of Guyang County, where they no longer have combat effectiveness.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Around Shijiazhuang; Battles Also Occurring on Both Sides of the Zhengtai Railway; Communist Forces Attacking Mancheng Have Been Defeated and Retreating South</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] It is reported that Shijiazhuang was suddenly attacked by three columns of communist forces at midnight on the 9th. Fierce battles for strongholds broke out on all four sides of the city and have not stopped as of the 10th. It is rumored that these large communist forces came from Shaanxi and Gansu, and the army also has more than a hundred camels. The fighting in Zhengding intensified on the afternoon of the 10th.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] The defending troops in Yuanshi and Luancheng counties south of Shijiazhuang have successively retreated to Xin'an north of Shijiazhuang. On the 9th, they abandoned Zhengding Station, and railway employees also evacuated on the last train at 8 p.m. on the 9th. However, Zhengding County is still firmly defended by the Nationalist army. The Zhengtai Line was still open to Shijiazhuang on the 9th, but there was also fighting on both sides of the railway. Officials stated that the situation is gradually stabilizing, and there is no need to worry about Zhengding and Shijiazhuang.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 10th] In order to concentrate its forces and consolidate Shijiazhuang, the Nationalist army has abandoned some small outposts on the periphery. It is rumored that the communist forces are only ten li away from the airfield. China National Aviation Corporation is preparing to evacuate. It is reported that the communist forces mobilized more than 50,000 troops this time.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 10th] The battle for Zhengding continued fiercely yesterday, with intense fighting for outposts on the periphery. Communist forces on the northwest sides have invaded within ten li. The military claims that Xin'an and Dongchangshou stations north of Zhengding are still under Nationalist army control. It is reported that traffic between Shijiazhuang and Zhengding has been cut off. A portion of the Nationalist army in Shijiazhuang moved north yesterday to reinforce. It is reported that communist forces from western Hebei, central Hebei, Taihang, and Gaocheng are gathering along the Hutuo River and the outskirts of Shijiazhuang. Communist forces on both sides of the Zhengtai Road are also attempting to break the road to cut off the connection between Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan, isolating Shijiazhuang. There are still communist forces gathering between Wangdu and Fangshunqiao north of Ding County, seemingly attempting to block the Nationalist army's southward movement between Beiping and Baoding. Luancheng County, southeast of Shijiazhuang, was fiercely attacked by more than 1,000 communist troops yesterday. The communist forces are currently claiming that they are determined to attack Shijiazhuang, intending to occupy this commercial city and connect Jin, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. It is said that the Nationalist army in Shijiazhuang and Zhengding is strong, and the communist forces' attack on Shijiazhuang is unlikely to succeed. In other news, the troops of Nie Rongzhen who attacked Mancheng for days have been defeated and are retreating south. The military on the Beiping-Baoding road is busy again.</p>
<h3>More Than 1,000 Communist Troops in Eastern Hubei Surrender to Huang'an County</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th] The Nationalist army is currently in contact with the communist forces in Shengfang Town, just south of Anci County on the south side of the Beiping-Tianjin Railway. [Central News Agency, Hankou, 10th] Since early March, the Yang Hongxian faction of the Communist Jianghan Detachment, with more than 1,000 men and guns, along with more than 30 light and heavy machine guns, fled east across the Pinghan Railway from western Hubei. After being fiercely pursued and intercepted by the Nationalist army and local militias, more than 300 people, including Chief of Staff Chen Rongsheng, were killed, and more than 500 were captured in the vicinity of Luotian, Macheng, and Huang'an. More than 30 light and heavy machine guns and more than 100 rifles were seized. Yang himself, realizing that he was in a dead end and had no way to escape, was forced to lead the remaining 1,000 people, eight long and short guns, to surrender to Huang'an County on the 8th of this month. After hearing the news, the Xingyuan has ordered the Songbu Suppression Command to transfer them to Hankou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 10th] Zheng Mofeng, deputy director of the Communist Qichun Border Region in Xishui, surrendered to the Qichun County government on March 2, bringing seven rifles and two pistols.</p>
<h3>Busy Communist Troop Movements in the Lushan Area; Planning to Flee Back to Linyi and Fei County; Communist Forces Near Tangyin in Northern Henan Collapsing</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 10th] The communist forces in the Yimeng Mountains and the Yishui and Ju County areas have been busy with troop movements in recent days, with a tendency to flee to Linyi and Fei County. The newly formed 8th Column, reorganized from the Communist 3rd, 4th, and 9th Divisions, has now fled to the Hongrui Banqiao area, 22 kilometers northeast of Linyi, and has built five pontoon bridges on the Yi River west of Tangtou, planning to cross the river and invade the west. In addition, the command post of the Communist 6th Field Column is now located in Liguanzhuang, 20 kilometers north of Linyi. The Nationalist army on that line is currently closely monitoring.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 10th] A major battle in the mountainous areas of central and southern Shandong is still brewing rapidly. According to qualified observers, a major battle may unfold gradually in the near future in the area north of Linyi or east of Tai'an.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 10th] The Communist New 3rd Column and 8th Division are currently fleeing to the Wutai area, 22 kilometers southwest of Mengyin. In addition, their 7th and 8th Divisions are currently fleeing to Fangcheng, 7 kilometers northeast of Bianqiao, attempting to make trouble.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 10th] Luo Xingli, chief of staff of the Second Pacification Zone, recently flew from Jinan to Xuzhou to report to Commander-in-Chief Gu and request instructions. He will return to Jinan within days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jinan, 10th] Since the Nationalist army occupied the important pass of Tai'an on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, a small number of vehicles have been traveling between Nanjing and Jinan since the 10th. However, the last leg of the journey requires the use of animal-drawn carts. From Nanjing, take a train to Xuzhou, then transfer to trucks and buses north. It takes two days to reach Teng County, and from there it takes another four days to reach Jinan. According to officials in the provincial capital, it is hoped that within two weeks, the army can protect official and commercial trucks and buses traveling south to Xuzhou. Travelers from the south say that communist raiding teams are still lying in ambush to sabotage transportation, so travel is only possible during the day. The hundreds of kilometers of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway between Jinan and Xuzhou are lacking rails and other materials, and repairs are inevitably slow. Even the most optimistic people say that traffic between Jinan and Nanjing cannot be smooth until after the decisive battle in central Shandong and the main force of the communist forces is defeated.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 10th] The remaining troops of the Communist Independent 1st and 2nd Brigades and the 7th Division in northern Henan have recently been active near Tangyin. After days of suppression by the Nationalist army, they are now fleeing northeast of Tangyin.</p>
<h3>Express Train Service Added Between Beiping and Baoding</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th] An express passenger train service has been added between Beiping and Baoding in the northern section of the Beiping-Hankou Railway, starting on the 10th. The entire journey of 154 kilometers takes six and a half hours.</p>
<h3>Chairman Sends Funds to Reward Yongnian Defenders</h3>

<h3>Yi Chieftain in Xikang Preparing to Petition in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Demands Participation in Government</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 10th] Ling Guanglei, the chieftain of Yuesong Tianba in Xikang, plans to go to Nanjing to petition for the issue of Yi participation in government. When he received the press in Chengdu, he issued a lengthy mimeographed document addressing the issue of Yi participation in government. His appeal stated that the Yi people number 1.5 million in Kang province alone, and even more in the three provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, making them one of the ten largest ethnic groups in the country, second only to the Han, Hui, and Manchu, and the fourth largest ethnic group in the country, exceeding the number of Tibetans by half. According to the provisions of the constitution, there are only two representatives in the National Assembly, and there are no ethnic quotas in the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, which is very unfair. He plans to petition in Nanjing, demanding that the ethnic group should have at least five representatives in the National Assembly, three legislators, and two supervisors. This chieftain is the grandson of Ling Chengen, a famous chieftain in the late Qing Dynasty. He is a person with innovative ideas, having graduated from the eighth class of the military academy. He has sought to reform the customs of the Yi people, encountering many obstacles, and is still working on it.</p>

<h3>Meeting of the Directors of the Four Banks Joint Treasury Handles Cases Such as Silk Industry Revival; U.S. Dollar Bonds Adopt a Voluntary Solicitation Method</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The 341st board meeting of the Four Banks Joint Treasury was held on the morning of the 10th, presided over by Vice Wang Hongjun. In addition to approving more than 70 loan cases, three temporary motions were passed: (1) In order to guide the surplus social funds to engage in construction projects and balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, the government decided to issue U.S. dollar bonds and U.S. dollar treasury bills, adopting a voluntary solicitation method for widespread sales. National banks should take the lead in launching solicitations to promote this. It was resolved that in addition to national banks and all employees actively purchasing and selling, public and private production enterprises applying for loans from various banks in the future should be encouraged to solicit sales of bonds or treasury bills. It was also resolved to organize a bond solicitation research group to plan and implement, appointing Liu Gongyun, Cai Gongchun, Tang Xiaoqi, Zhu Tongjiu, Li Shuming, Wu Rencang, Gu Chunfan, Shou Miancheng, Chen Bingzhang, Dong Puming, Diao Minren, Tian Ding'an, and nineteen others as members, designating Liu Gongyun and Li Shuming as conveners. (2) The Joint Treasury has approved large loans to the silk industry in various places over the years. This year, Sichuan Silk Company and the silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces have applied for loans again. According to last year's situation, the sales of domestic raw silk in foreign markets were not smooth. The reason is that the cost is too high and the selling price is too expensive, which affects sales. However, raw silk is China's main export commodity and still needs active assistance. At present, silk mills in coastal areas have been severely damaged by the Japanese during the period of occupation, and it is difficult to resume production. If the Japanese silk industry actively develops in the future, the future of China's silk industry will face the impact of Japanese silk competition. It seems that the competent authorities should find ways to solve this difficulty to facilitate the revival of the silk industry. It was resolved to request the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Export Promotion Committee to study and plan separately and to negotiate with relevant friendly countries to safeguard the normal development of China's silk industry. (3) The Joint Treasury has approved a large number of loans to public and private production enterprises over the years. According to the "Coordinated Promotion Program for Assisting Production and Sales of Daily Necessities and Export Commodities," the production enterprises that have received loans should increase production in accordance with the predetermined plan and sell finished products at prices announced by the government in order to assist the government in stabilizing prices. It was resolved that the borrowing agencies of each production enterprise should report the output and selling price to the Joint Treasury for verification at any time after receiving the loan. If it is a production and sales enterprise for export commodities, it should also report the export and foreign exchange settlement situation together to facilitate assessment. Finally, since the government implemented the method of rationing daily necessities in March, employees of various national banks have not yet received in-kind rations. It should be handled uniformly immediately. It was resolved that the difference in the value of the in-kind rations should be issued by each bank and bureau, and no other names should be created.</p>

<h3>Fourth Meeting of the Price Stabilization Committee Decides on Measures to Stabilize Rice Prices; Pang Songzhou to Arrive in Shanghai to Resolve Rice Shortage</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 10th] The National Economic Council's Price Stabilization Committee held a meeting on the 10th, with the main topic of discussion being the recent price fluctuations in both Nanjing and Shanghai. The main reasons for the rice price fluctuations are (1) the transition between harvests and (2) rice merchants from the South purchasing large quantities of civilian grain in the Suzhou and Changzhou areas, which stimulated the psychology of rice merchants. The meeting decided on the following measures to stabilize prices: (1) The government plans to sell large quantities of foreign rice at low prices on the market. (2) Large batches of foreign rice from Siam, Annam, and other places will arrive successively, ensuring that Shanghai will not face a rice shortage. (3) Rice rations will be distributed to workers and public school teachers in Nanjing and Shanghai. (4)糧次龐松舟 is scheduled to go to Shanghai to study the solution to Shanghai's rice shortage with relevant parties and the price of rice to be sold, with the next three months being the most critical period. However, if the above points are resolved, the situation can be safely overcome. In addition, Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen reported in detail at the Price Stabilization Committee meeting the reasons and situation of the rice price fluctuations in Shanghai.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Price Stabilization Committee held its fourth meeting at 3:00 PM on the 10th. Wu Guozhen and others were present. Weng Wenhao chaired the meeting. First, Wu Guozhen reported on the situation of rice price fluctuations in Shanghai. Then, Wang Yunwu reported on the supply of daily necessities to public school teachers in Nanjing and Shanghai, and Pang Songzhou reported on grain prices. Then, the following proposals were discussed: (1) How to stabilize yarn prices? It was resolved to strengthen the organization of the Cotton Yarn Control Committee. (2) Regarding the increase in edible oil production, it was resolved (A) that the government should provide oil loans, with the principle of enabling oil merchants to purchase oil materials to double production; (B) that the reason for the increase in Shantou prices is the inconvenience of transportation and excessive exports, so the government is now considering restricting edible oil exports; (C) to organize the distribution of public oil. (3) Measures to stabilize wages in Tianjin City. After discussion, it was decided to use the prices of six items distributed as the standard for stabilization. (4) How to coordinate and reserve fuel in the Nanjing and Shanghai area. It was resolved that the reason for the coal shortage is that too little coal is coming from Taiwan and North China. It is now decided to find ways to increase the amount of coal that can be transported from North China, and if necessary, purchase and transport foreign coal, so that Shanghai's coal storage reaches at least 50,000 tons and up to 100,000 tons. As for the rent issue, it was not discussed today due to time constraints.</p>
<p>[Our Beijing Dispatch on the 10th] Prices in Beijing have soared in recent days, especially food. The increase in grain prices is the most crazy.

<h3>Shanghai Reporters Return from Jiangsu; Inspection Team Observes North China; Talk of the People's Suffering in Northern Jiangsu; Communist Troops Flee East and West Along the Coast; Local Grassroots Administration is Unsound</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A group of nineteen Shanghai reporters who visited Northern Jiangsu returned to Shanghai yesterday. The trip lasted nine days and visited Nantong, Haimen, Rugao, Dongtai, and other places. Although it was a fleeting visit, generally speaking, the people in the countryside are suffering unspeakable hardships, and the number of people fleeing to other places is increasing daily. In addition to guarding the points and lines, the communist troops appear and disappear unpredictably in other areas. Although a corner of the city or town appears to be peaceful, it is difficult to move only one or two li away from the city, and it is even more terrifying at night. This phenomenon is particularly evident in Dongtai, Rugao, and Yancheng.</p>
<p>The Battle of Libao</p>
<p>The communist troops recently launched a relatively large-scale raid and attacked Libao, northeast of Rugao. The battle began at 9:00 AM on the 2nd of this month. The communist troops launched an all-out attack with eleven regiments. At that time, the garrison only had one battalion to fight. Relying on the strength of their firepower, they forced the communist troops to suffer heavy casualties. By dawn on the 3rd, the communist troops used "militia" as a vanguard and approached the earthen walls around Libao. By daytime, they had entered the streets and launched a fierce street battle. At that time, the National Army had retreated to a stronghold in the southeast corner, waiting for reinforcements to arrive. At this point, the National Army transferred two regiments of troops from Dingjiaao and Baohekou to join the siege. On the 5th, they finally repelled all of them. In this battle, the National Army suffered more than 900 casualties, while the communist troops suffered more than 3,000 casualties. The weapons used by the communist troops this time included Russian-style machine guns and a small number of mortars. After the battle, the National Army captured more than 20 machine guns and more than 200 rifles. According to Wang Tiehan, the division commander who commanded the battle, the communist troops' large-scale invasion came from the sea. Currently, the communist troops have more than 300 large sailboats in the coastal areas of Northern Jiangsu, fleeing east and west unpredictably. Moreover, because the communist troops' political work is pervasive, they act extremely flexibly, often avoiding the main force of the National Army and focusing on eliminating local armed forces.</p>
<p>When the Green Crops Appear</p>
<p>Now, the people are increasingly fearful as the time when the green crops appear is approaching. The National Army also attaches great importance to this issue. However, Li Moan, the Pacification Commander, believes that the current situation in Northern Jiangsu is three parts military and seven parts political. If the communist troops are to be cleared before the green crops appear, the people's self-defense forces must be strengthened. He also said: "We must not ignore Northern Jiangsu, nor can we think that it is already peaceful, nor can we overestimate the communist troops, thinking that the chaos in Northern Jiangsu will never end."</p>
<p>Multiple Layers of Exploitation</p>
<p>As for local administration, due to the unsoundness of the grassroots level, all work cannot be promoted smoothly. In the countryside, because "bad people" are in power, the people are almost unable to make a living. There are many types of apportioned taxes and donations. Local ruffians and hooligans take the opportunity to rise up, extorting and blackmailing in endless ways. In addition, the security team has broken discipline, and the people are particularly dissatisfied with this, which is heartbreaking to hear.</p>
<p>Military Situation</p>
<p>A certain military officer sighed and said: What is hoped for is three parts military and seven parts political, but in reality, it is the opposite. The current actual situation is seven parts military and three parts political, which is far from ideal. He also compared the military and political work of our army and the communist army, saying that the situation on both sides is like a "triangular pyramid." The tip of the communist army is political work, and then they use force. Our side is the opposite, and the effect is greatly reduced.</p>
<p>In addition, when various counties in Northern Jiangsu are singing the praises of implementing land reform policies, in the current situation, it is only a piece of paper, and the actual problem is still far away. In short, this trip to Northern Jiangsu is full of bunkers and a solemn atmosphere. Although the wheat is verdant and the peach blossoms are red on both sides of the highway, after comparing them, the strong atmosphere of war greatly diminishes the mood.</p>
<h3>Syngman Rhee Went to Nanjing Last Night; After Meeting with the Chairman, He Will Return to Shanghai and Fly to Seoul; Various Groups in Shanghai Gave a Public Banquet for Mr. Rhee Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Dr. Syngman Rhee, the Korean revolutionary leader, arrived in Shanghai from the United States the day before yesterday and was warmly welcomed by all walks of life.

At 4:00 PM, 21 groups from the Municipal Government, Municipal Party Headquarters, Senate, Sino-Korean Cultural Association, National Foreign Association, Municipal Women's Association, Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, and Journalists Association jointly held a cocktail party on the 14th floor of the International Hotel to receive Mr. Rhee. Li Shizeng served as chairman and delivered a welcoming speech, praising Dr. Rhee's spirit of working hard for the revolutionary movement and recounting Dr. Rhee's efforts abroad during the Anti-Japanese War to engage in anti-aggression work.</p>
<p>Syngman Rhee's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Dr. Rhee delivered a speech, first thanking the 21 groups in the city for their warm reception, and then saying: In the future, the friendship between the Korean people and the Chinese people will be even closer. He hopes that when everyone comes to Korea in the future, the Korean people will also have the opportunity to repay the hospitality. He is quite tired from this trip to China from the United States and cannot say everything, but he hopes that after returning home, he can organize the government, develop Korea's diplomatic, economic, and other positions, so that Korea can also become a strong member in the Far East. If China and Korea work together hand in hand, the future of peace in the Far East will be optimistic.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Speech</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai also stood up and gave a speech, expressing his admiration for Dr. Rhee, and saying: If a country wants to be strong and the people healthy, economic growth is an important factor. China and Korea have been cooperating very well during the war. In the future, they should not only continue to cooperate politically, but also trade with each other commercially to enhance the economies of the two countries.</p>
<p>Xi Yushu, representing the National Foreign Association, welcomed Mr. Rhee and also stated that this welcome to Mr. Rhee is of great significance. The meeting of the leaders of China and Korea will lay the foundation for a permanent friendship between the two countries for generations to come. China and Korea have been oppressed by foreign forces in the past century. This time, the Anti-Japanese War achieved victory, and the two countries have great value. In the future, whether it is the governments or the people of the two countries, they should cooperate sincerely. Mr. Rhee's return to his country this time to organize the government will require great effort. Before the Korean government is formally established, we hope that we can give it the greatest sympathy and strong assistance.</p>
<p>Ms. Qian Jianqiu, representing the women of this city, paid tribute to Mr. Rhee and hoped that the women of China and Korea would also help each other and cooperate in the future.</p>
<p>At 7:00 PM yesterday, the Korean Overseas Chinese Association held a banquet for Mr. Rhee at the Navy YMCA, with Xu Binghao serving as chairman.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of US Loans to Korea; The US State Department Denies Syngman Rhee's Talks in Shanghai; Chairman of the Korean Affairs Research Association Accuses Rhee of Spreading Rumors</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] When Korean revolutionary leader Dr. Syngman Rhee came to Shanghai the day before yesterday, he revealed to reporters in this city that President Truman of the United States had agreed to provide Korea with a loan of 600 million yuan in gold for construction and reconstruction. When this news reached Washington, the US State Department spokesperson formally denied yesterday that the loan had been formally approved by the US authorities. When reporters asked Dr. Rhee about the denial from Washington yesterday, Dr. Rhee stated again that he had indeed discussed the loan with President Truman in the United States. Although President Truman did not determine the amount of the loan at that time, he had in principle agreed to the Korean economic assistance plan and had stated that after the Korean government was formally established, the US government could provide South Korea with a loan of about 600 million US dollars.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 9th] A State Department official today denied Syngman Rhee's statement to reporters in Shanghai yesterday that the United States had decided to grant Korea a loan of $600 million, saying that the US government was drafting a Korean reconstruction plan, but the total amount of funds and other issues had not yet been decided. The funds seemed to be far less than the amount of $600 million. A few weeks ago, the State Department hinted that it would formulate a three-year Korean reconstruction plan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington, 9th] Kim Young-in (transliteration), chairman of the Korean Affairs Research Association, today referred to the statement made by Korean political leader Syngman Rhee in Shanghai that "the United States is prepared to lend Korea 600 million US dollars" as entirely fabricated. Kim also said: "The amount should be between 400 million and 600 million US dollars, but the United States will use it for the reconstruction of the Korean economy and is not a loan at all. Syngman Rhee made this statement in an attempt to increase his personal prestige and to take credit for obtaining the loan, but Korea does not need this loan."</p>

<h3>Countermeasures for Stabilizing Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Price Review Council was officially established yesterday. At a time when prices are on the verge of rising, the formal establishment of the council and the convening of its first meeting have drawn keen expectations from all sides.</p>
<p>According to the "Implementation Measures for Price Review," the council has two functions: (1) to review the prices of essential daily necessities; and (2) to assist in reporting violations of agreed-upon prices. Therefore, its evaluation targets have been defined as essential daily necessities, and the means it employs is price negotiation rather than price control. The standards for price negotiation are clearly stated: profits may be added to the cost of goods at appropriate rates, in accordance with local industry practices. In addition to manufacturing costs or the original purchase price, the calculation of costs may include interest, taxes, transportation costs, warehouse rent, management fees, insurance, depreciation, etc. However, if any of the above items undergoes drastic changes, a re-evaluation will inevitably be necessary to ensure compliance with costs and profits. Article 13 of the "Implementation Measures" has clearly stipulated this point. Therefore, the outcome of implementing price negotiation is not what people generally expect – to completely curb the rising trend or reduce prices to a certain level. Its greatest effect is simply to impose limitations on time and price, preventing excessive and continuous price increases. In other words, its role is one of mitigation, not suppression, and its approach is to adopt measures of continuous adjustment, rather than making rigid and immutable stipulations. Therefore, the outcome of price negotiation is more accurately described as price stabilization than price suppression. Why? Because price increases are not allowed before new negotiated prices are approved and announced. If prices are increased without authorization, the "Regulations for Suppressing Acts Against Price Control and Price Negotiation" may be applied for punishment.</p>
<p>From this, it can also be inferred that the Price Review Council has the ability to provide timely stabilization in the face of unreasonable price increases driven by speculation and manipulation. Because prices based on cost plus a reasonable profit are permitted by law and cannot be considered speculation or manipulation. The so-called speculation and manipulation must result in price increases beyond the legal cost and profit, which can be negotiated by the council at any time and strictly enforced by the competent authorities. Moreover, assisting in reporting violations is also one of the council's functions. If there are any acts of violating negotiated prices and increasing prices without authorization, the council itself has the power to report them. Therefore, the council is indeed responsible and empowered to deal with such illegal acts of speculation and manipulation.</p>
<p>However, price fluctuations have many causes, some due to speculation and manipulation, and others due to other factors. For example, surpluses and shortages in supply and demand, seasonal changes, tightness or looseness of credit, transportation bottlenecks, increases or decreases in taxes, labor unrest, harvest yields, fluctuations in production costs, and even fluctuations in currency value and foreign exchange rates, as well as political and military measures, can all affect prices, causing them to deviate from normal trends. Therefore, to achieve price stabilization, it is necessary to carefully study various aspects, seek solutions, and provide appropriate remedies for each. It is like treating a disease: the sources of the disease are different, and the prescriptions used cannot be the same. The meaning of "prescribing medicine according to the disease" or "prescribing the right medicine for the symptoms" lies in this.</p>
<p>The recent price increases have been quite intense. Whether this is due to speculation and manipulation or whether there are other reasons is a very complex issue and seems difficult to determine. Yesterday, the authorities conducted strict investigations, and items such as soap, candles, matches, silk fabrics, and cotton cloth have seen slight price decreases, indicating that the price increases for some goods do have artificial factors involved. However, the prices of most goods, such as rice, oil, and miscellaneous grains, continue to jump, or even are only offered at high prices but not sold, and do not become calm and return to normal due to the attention or persuasion of the authorities. This proves that the situation is not as simple as one might imagine.</p>
<p>Since the victory, production has shrunk, idle capital has been rampant, and coupled with transportation, power, raw materials, high interest rates, wages, heavy taxes, smuggling, and other reasons, the situation of industry and commerce has been deteriorating, resembling a combination of several ailments. This is an undeniable fact. Therefore, the treatment must also be comprehensive, with efforts focused on various aspects to achieve gradual progress. It is reported that the authorities are preparing to continue selling rice, and the household sugar program has also been decided to continue. For oil raw materials, 8,000 tons of soybeans have been secured and can be allocated for factory use, while exports have been prohibited. For industrial necessities, the authorities have also approved the supply of foreign exchange for continuous procurement. These measures are fundamental solutions for suppressing prices. We hope that this approach will be expanded more widely and effectively, promoting both price subsidies and production guidance, while also selling bonds to absorb idle capital, and then supplementing with price negotiation measures to crack down on all illegal speculative transactions. With such comprehensive measures, making progress on both fronts, it may be possible to achieve a considerable effect on price stabilization. If this is not done, and excessive emphasis is placed on price negotiation, it may be nothing more than wishful thinking.</p>

<h3>The Foreign Ministers' Conference Falls into Stalemate Again - The German-Polish Border is Difficult to Determine - Three Conflicting Views Cannot Be Reconciled</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 10th] The Anglo-American proposal to revise the western border of Poland has become an absolute stalemate at today's Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. According to various indications, this stalemate will affect the entire German border issue. The future of the Ruhr industrial area, the Rhine, and the Saar has not been discussed by the four powers. However, the general view among Western countries is that if agreement cannot be reached on the eastern border of Germany, it is unlikely that any border will be resolved.</p>
<p>[Our Report] London, 10th Broadcast: According to a statement from the French representative, the French Foreign Minister Bidault will request the Foreign Ministers' Conference to immediately approve the economic merger of the Saar into France and to study France's proposal to create an independent status for the Ruhr and the Rhineland. As negotiations between the Western powers and the Soviet Union on the re-division of the German-Polish border have reached a stalemate, the re-raising of this issue by France is expected to plunge the entire German border issue into difficulties, creating serious political consequences.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference met today to discuss the German border issue and reached three different views, which are difficult to reconcile. U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall supports the views of British Foreign Secretary Bevin, while French Foreign Minister Bidault and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov each have their own views. Secretary of State Marshall wanted today's Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the German-Polish border, but Foreign Minister Bidault took the opportunity to reiterate France's position on the border issue, which is that it is a comprehensive issue that cannot be resolved separately. Secretary of State Marshall and Foreign Secretary Bevin share a similar view on the economic perspective and believe that the border issue should be observed from an economic perspective in order to take into account the economic development interests of Germany, Poland, and other European countries, thereby contributing to the peace and security of Europe. The current border has unbalanced Germany and made Germany cede large areas of agricultural land, making it unable to supply food to the people of the whole country. Therefore, some measures should be taken to balance its industry and agriculture. The most important of these is that Poland should return some agricultural areas to Germany. As for whether Poland can fully utilize this land and contribute to its own country and other European countries, it is difficult to say. According to Foreign Secretary Bevin himself, Poland's border was too far east in 1919 and is now too far west. The method taken in France's view to balance German workers and agriculture is for Germany to obtain its western industrial area to compensate for the loss of its eastern agricultural area. As for the Saar and Ruhr areas, this cannot be confused with the territorial claims put forward by Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. In addition, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov insisted on his original position, refusing to compromise with the opinions of Britain and France, and said that the German-Polish border had become a fait accompli and was recognized by the Allied powers at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 9th] Britain and the United States proposed at the Foreign Ministers' Conference today to establish an international committee to formulate detailed rules for the German-Polish border, allowing Poland to retain administrative control over the industrial area of Silesia, but part of the industrial area currently occupied by Poland should be returned to Germany. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov opposed the proposal, saying that according to the Potsdam Agreement, the 40,000 square miles of land Poland took from Germany, including Silesia and the base, should all belong to Poland. French Foreign Minister Bidault said that the border issue needs to be studied further, but he did not state whether he supported or opposed the current border.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th] The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference met today to discuss the issue of which countries should be invited to participate in the future peace treaty with Germany. The four deputy foreign ministers still had very different opinions on inviting Albania to participate. France and the Soviet Union supported Albania's participation, but Britain and the United States expressed their dissent. U.S. Representative Murphy raised the issue of whether Latin American countries that participated in the war against the Axis powers should participate in the peace conference, saying that some of these countries had made significant contributions to the war against Japan, and that other countries had contributed even more by joining the war later. Soviet Representative Vyshinsky spoke to refute this, saying, "We are not discussing the Japanese issue here. I hope that when we discuss the Japanese issue, we can proceed more quickly than we are discussing the German issue."</p>
<h3>U.S. Republican Presidential Candidate Stassen Meets with Stalin - Candid Discussion of Economic Systems of Both Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 10th] U.S. Republican presidential candidate Stassen met with Premier Stalin for 80 minutes last night, with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also present. According to Stassen's statement to reporters: "We candidly discussed the economic systems of both countries. I have requested the Soviet side to provide a record of the conversation, and I may be able to comment in detail after receiving it. Premier Stalin spoke very cautiously and occasionally smoked." He also said that he had visited the Sverdlovsk wartime tank manufacturing heavy industrial plant in the Urals, which has now been converted to manufacturing well-drilling equipment. Stassen has just returned from a three-day tour of the Ural region. If the weather is clear today, he plans to fly to Kyiv.</p>
<h3>Wallace Advocates - U.S. Loans to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Disapproves of U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace told reporters here: In the next three months, the United States may formulate a foreign policy that could lead to war, and I will do my best to prevent this policy from being decided. He also said: Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have not yet abandoned their policies of imperialism or expansion, but the strength used by Britain in this regard is not as great as that of the United States and the Soviet Union. Britain has set a deadline to withdraw from India and Burma, which is the right policy. Reporters then asked what connection there was between de Gaulle's recent political activities and President Truman's aid plan. Wallace said: He believes there is a close connection between the two. Wallace strongly advocated that the United States lend to the Soviet Union, but expressed regret at the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in international organizations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. Regarding U.S. aid to Greece and Turkey, he said that he has always opposed loans that do not have productive purposes, and he especially opposes political loans.</p>
<h3>Czech External Representative Hradil Arrives in Moscow</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, Erri] Hradil, Director of the Treaty Department of the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and his assistant Fischer arrived here today. Gross, Director of the Information Department of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived here two weeks ago. The mission of their arrival is unclear, but they may stay here as informal observers of the Moscow Conference.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senators Criticize - Current Government Policies</h3>
<p>Say It Should Not Fund Soviet Satellite States</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are currently discussing foreign aid issues. Some Republican senators oppose the current government's contradictory policies, while other Republican senators continue to urge the expedited approval of the $400 million aid package for Greece and Turkey and the $350 million aid package for China and European countries. Republican Senator Butler said in the Senate: The United States is launching the world's largest bounty competition, providing funding to both sides of the competition, that is, aiding Greece and Turkey on one hand, while also providing loans to the Soviet satellite states on the other. Butler opposed the following three plans: (1) The State Department's request to allocate $25 million to settle accounts with the United States, including the final settlement of the Lend-Lease accounts; (2) The government's extension to give potatoes to "Stalin's main puppet, Yugoslav President Tito"; (3) Poland and the Czech Republic's applications to the International Bank for U.S. dollar loans. Republican Representative Taber, Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, demanded an explanation as to why Truman could not stop export licenses to the Soviet-occupied areas, which would lead U.S. foreign policy in one direction. Taber said that this refers to the termination of the UNRRA plan for aid to Poland, Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and Belarus. On the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the majority of members demanded the swift approval of the $350 million aid plan for China, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Austria, and Poland, but three Republican opposition members adopted the same position as Taber, demanding that the funding for this plan be reduced to $200 million.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Search for Fugitives in the Four Occupation Zones of Germany</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 10th] The police of the four countries – Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union – suddenly conducted a simultaneous search in their respective zones last night to arrest deserters, war criminals, and black market merchants. It is reported that this was first proposed by the Soviet side and then implemented after being decided by the four commanders-in-chief. It was kept strictly secret beforehand, with only ten people knowing about it. However, some Americans believe that this move is not in line with democratic principles and have expressed their opposition. According to well-informed sources, this is because the United States does not recognize some exiled people as Soviet citizens, so the Soviet side intends to arrest them. In addition to the Allied police, 5,000 German police also participated in the operation, going to brothels, gambling dens, and other places to search. The dividing lines of the occupation zones were all guarded by troops to prevent the police from crossing the border and causing trouble.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Revising the Anglo-Soviet Treaty - Widely Divergent Opinions</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 9th] Regarding the revision of the Anglo-Soviet alliance, it was recently reported that people close to the British government said that both Britain and the Soviet Union have put forward proposals for the alliance and have shown that their opinions are widely divergent. Therefore, this alliance may not be signed before British Foreign Secretary Bevin returns from Moscow. However, most of the work must be completed before Foreign Secretary Bevin leaves the Soviet Union and returns home. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has already put forward a counter-proposal after receiving the draft proposed by Britain in accordance with the Franco-Soviet alliance of December 1944. Its wording is quite vague. The British draft was drafted with reference to the Anglo-French Dunkirk Treaty, and its preamble stipulates that both signatories believe that this new treaty will be of great benefit in resolving all outstanding issues between the two countries, but the draft proposed by the Soviet Union does not have this provision. In addition, the Soviet draft does not mention the San Francisco Charter, nor does it involve the Dunkirk Treaty. The Soviet Union has not expressed its willingness to see the countries responsible for the German issue conclude the same treaty. Even in the first article, the British draft stipulates that if Germany adopts an aggressive policy or takes measures to facilitate its aggression, the two signatories should immediately consult with other countries responsible for the German issue, and then take common measures. The Soviet draft does not mention prior consultation. But in any case, British people ultimately hope that Foreign Secretary Bevin can eliminate these differences with the Soviet Union in Moscow. After the preliminary work is completed, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Peterson will be able to complete this negotiation after Foreign Secretary Bevin returns to the country.</p>
<h3>Wartime Secrets</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] President Roosevelt's book "Wartime Cooperation" was published in New York today. The book reveals that Roosevelt wrote to Pope Pius XII on September 3, 1941, stating, "I believe that the Soviet Union also has a dictatorship like Germany, but I feel that the danger of the Soviet dictatorship to the security of other countries is not as great as that of the German dictatorship." The book also reveals that the United States knew about Hitler's plan to attack the Soviet Union six months in advance and immediately notified Moscow. Former U.S. Special Envoy to the Vatican, Taylor, wrote in the introduction to the book: Because the Soviet Union denies religion, helping the Soviet Union is a problem for the church, and it is necessary for Washington and the Vatican to exchange opinions on this.</p>
<h3>High U.S. Prices - Cabinet Discusses Countermeasures</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] The Cabinet held a special meeting today to discuss the problem of high prices. Knowles, Chairman of President Truman's Council of Economic Advisers, read a lengthy report at the cabinet meeting. Knowles reported to the President yesterday on the increase in prices and said that the issue was "serious." A White House spokesman announced today that the cabinet meeting did not decide what countermeasures to take, nor was it prepared to take any action.</p>
<h3>Rumors of U.S. Participation in Anglo-Indian Conference - Discussing Indian Defense Issues - Officials Neither Confirm nor Deny</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 9th] People close to the situation here recently said that the United States has also recently participated in the Anglo-Indian Army talks here to discuss Indian defense issues after the British army withdraws by June next year. This move can also be regarded as a U.S. anti-communist action. It is rumored that the main content of the talks is about what kind of assistance Britain and the United States need to provide after the British army withdraws in order to defend its northern "back door" and prevent the intrusion of communist forces. These talks are kept strictly secret, and the names of the participating U.S. military officers are also unknown. According to the Communist "Daily Worker," this matter was apparently initiated by the Anglo-American Joint Staff in Washington. It is learned that the talks ended a week ago when Brigadier General Cariappa, a senior Indian military officer, returned to New Delhi. It is expected that Cariappa will report the progress of the talks to General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, Governor-General Mountbatten, and Nehru after returning to India. According to private Indian sources, the number of U.S. State Department officials in New Delhi has recently tripled compared to the past few months, and the United States has actually begun building defenses in India during the war. Observers also said that U.S. troops have moved to northern India, the Assam-Burma Railway, and wartime temporary barracks. In addition, the United States announced last month that it had established diplomatic relations with India and granted a loan to the Kingdom of Nepal between northern India and Tibet.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] The impression obtained after an official investigation here is that London may be holding a three-way meeting to discuss India's future military policy, but it is only informal and private in nature. This news has not been officially confirmed, and Army Department officials have declined to comment. It is reported that the State Department has inquired the Army Department about this matter, but officials have not denied it either, leading everyone to believe that this news cannot be publicly discussed at present. A responsible party said: What do you think?</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department Denies Loan Plan to Korea</h3>

<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 10th] The embezzlement of surplus materials has shocked the Philippines. President Roxas told the press today: "The Philippines will definitely conduct a thorough investigation into this matter immediately. No one believes that the committee appointed to handle surplus materials has engaged in any irregularities. Accusations of corruption against the committee are mostly from those who are isolated or have not obtained the privilege of purchasing surplus materials. If their motives are impure, they should be strictly investigated. According to the U.S. surplus materials agreement, we will obtain surplus materials worth $630 million. If the surplus materials actually transferred to the Philippine government are less than this amount, the terms of the agreement must be adjusted." At the same time, a spokesperson for the U.S. military headquarters in the Philippines stated that Commander Moya is currently studying a lengthy report on the theft of materials from U.S. Army bases and will issue a formal statement soon.</p>

<h3>Anti-Communist Wave Sweeps the United States</h3>
<p>New York Airmail on April 1st</p>
<p>Special Correspondent, Xiang Jun</p>
<p>Although capitalist countries have a strong inherent anti-communist nature, the United States, for the sake of its democratic system which reveres freedom, has at least superficially refrained from discriminating against the Communist Party in the past. Generally, government officials and businessmen pride themselves on the excellence of the democratic system. Although the capitalist system seems outdated and backward to the "progressive" faction, they point out that everyone is well-off and self-sufficient, so why do people around the world want to come to this land and ask for assistance? In their complacency, they do not directly attack the Communist Party. However, the atmosphere this past month has been different. Especially since President Truman called on Congress on March 12 to appropriate funds to aid Greece and Turkey to resist the expansionist ambitions spreading across Europe, the rhetoric has been universally praised, hailed as the "Truman Doctrine," comparable to the Monroe Doctrine and President Roosevelt's famous Lend-Lease Act speech. According to last week's Gallup poll, Truman's prestige, which had once declined, has been greatly boosted by this speech, and the Communist Party in this free country has been shaded by misfortune as a result.</p>
<h3>Anti-Communism in the U.S. Becomes More Pronounced</h3>
<p>The wave of resistance to the Communist Party already had some splashes in the past, such as the anti-communist movement in the C.I.O. labor union last autumn and anti-communist speeches by famous parliamentarians. However, there were few precedents for government advocacy and parliamentary action. Although President Truman's speech did not mention names, the United States' determination to adopt an uncompromising spirit to prevent the spread of international communism was unambiguous. Subsequently, Secretary of State Marshall voiced support in Moscow, and Undersecretary of State Acheson elaborated on the issue multiple times in congressional review meetings, making Washington's position clear to the world. Acheson said: Aiding Greece and Turkey to resist expansionism will not cause war; on the contrary, if Greece and Turkey are not aided and the flames are allowed to continue, that will be the spark for World War III. Therefore, some people asked at the time what would happen if China were also ruled by the Communist Party. Acheson replied emphatically that the United States would not look with favor upon that. This proves that the U.S.'s international diplomatic foundation is about to enter a decision stage and is not indulging in wistful dreams of the past. It has been moving in this direction for the past year, but now it is more obvious.</p>
<p>The second wave of attacks on the Communist Party was the White House's order on March 22 to investigate federal employees for loyalty to the country. Previously, the War Manpower Commission in the United States fired an employee in 1944 because he participated in a "communist front" organization and opposed U.S. aid to the Allies, but when the Soviet Union was attacked by Germany, he also advocated aid to the Soviet Union. After investigation, he was found to have engaged in disloyal behavior. After a lawsuit, the Supreme Court recently ruled in favor of the government, tacitly approving the government's principle of this action. Therefore, Truman's order already has strong support.</p>
<p>The order stipulates: (1) All current civil servants, except for Congress and the courts, must be investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to determine their loyalty to the country. (2) Any person deemed by the Attorney General to be a member of or sympathetic to the Fascist Communist Party or a group intending to subvert the government must be fired. This order will affect the ten departments and independent agencies of the federal government, totaling 2.2 million people. This is another measure taken by the government in domestic affairs to ensure that all government employees, big and small, who receive government salaries, cannot engage in rebellious acts or conspiracies to subvert the country.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Eightieth Congress, now controlled by the Republican Party, is working very hard. There was originally a Committee on Un-American Activities in Congress, which was established to deal with this type of "harm to the republic." Now, it is facing an even more pressing question: should the Communist Party simply be declared illegal and directly banned? The committee has already drafted a bill and began reviewing it the day before yesterday. Newspapers and radios are debating, and advertisements have been placed for lectures. The first shot was fired by Truman's Secretary of Labor, Schwellenbach, in a speech on the West Coast, advocating a legal ban on the Communist Party. Republican members Thomas, Congressman Rankin, and Hartley have all proposed anti-communist bills. In addition to the loan to aid Greece and Turkey, a debate on banning the activities of the Communist Party has arisen in Congress, which was already boisterous. In recent days, the Congressional Review Committee has heard reports from the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and testimony from the general secretary of the American Communist Party, as well as statements from third parties. The issue is moving towards its climax day by day. This event is likely to attract even more attention from the people of our country.</p>
<h3>U.S. Attitude Shifts</h3>
<p>In all fairness, the average American is not afraid of communism itself and prefers to allow the Communist Party to exist in order to protect human rights and freedom. They know that Marx's predictions about capitalism have not come true, and in such a rich and prosperous country, not many people will fall for the Communist Party's tricks. Therefore, even though the Communist Party exists, it will never be successful. It is like having maggots in a clean environment that will not grow, so there is no need to worry. However, as time passes, this attitude seems to be changing. On the one hand, they see that the opinions of the Soviet Union and the Western democratic countries have been irreconcilable in the past year, and there seems to be a deep grievance that is difficult to resolve. At the same time, the Soviet Union is expanding its conquest on the shattered European continent. On the other hand, they are also afraid that the Communist Parties in various countries are, in fact, mostly lackeys of the Red International, plotting internal subversion and are not a nation-based political party that sincerely advocates democracy. They only know how to be loyal to the Soviet Union and aim to subvert the government and sell out their country. As a result, their antipathy deepens, and they cannot help but be alert to their own safety. According to last week's Gallup poll report, 52% of Americans now believe that the Soviet Union harbors the intention of conquering the world. On the 26th, FBI Director Hoover stated in Congress that the American Communist Party is a fifth column whose purpose is to subvert the government. They are loyal to the Soviet Union, not the United States. Hoover said that since President Truman's declaration of aid to Greece and Turkey, the American Communist Party has mobilized in many ways to oppose it, holding mass meetings or threatening Congress with letters and telegrams. He also said that the organization of the American Communist Party is even better than that of the Nazis. In the past few years, they have accepted instructions from the Paris Communist Party, which were relayed from Moscow. The Director also provided investigation figures, stating that the top communist in New York State has 30,000 people, followed by California with 8,553 people, then Illinois with 6,500, Ohio with 3,838, and Michigan with fewer at 2,135. In addition, there are many people who have not registered due to their positions. It should also be noted that although their numbers are not large, their penetration is particularly harmful. These words are as shocking as the testimony of Undersecretary of State Acheson, which caused Molotov to protest, that "the Soviet Union is expansionist," although the discovery was not very fresh in substance.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Tries to Incite Resistance</h3>
<p>Under the protection of the Constitution, the American Communist Party will certainly not remain idle. A full-page advertisement has been published in the newspaper with the headline "When they say they want to ban the Communist Party, you'll be next!" The advertisement asserts that members of Congress intend to destroy human rights, which will inevitably make everyone feel insecure and force the government to move toward the path of fascism. It reminds the public to quickly send letters and telegrams to President Truman, the chairman of the Congressional Subcommittee, and all members of Congress, opposing legislation banning the Communist Party. At the same time, it published an open letter to Secretary of State Marshall, saying that the speech you gave in Moscow on the true meaning of democracy was very good and hoping that you would quickly designate your spokesperson to present his views on this issue to Congress. In addition, it organized mass meetings, saying that the American Communist Party is a democratic force that supports labor and promotes the progress of black people, and it absolutely opposes the unconstitutional and fascist practices orchestrated by capitalists behind the scenes. The General Secretary of the American Communist Party, Eugene Dennis, who is about forty years old, voluntarily went to Washington D.C. yesterday to testify before Congress. Unfortunately, the result was not very good. Although his words were reasonable, when asked his real name and date of birth, he changed his expression and refused to give a truthful answer, causing him to quarrel with fiercely anti-communist members of Congress such as Mr. Thomas on the spot. Coincidentally, FBI Director Hoover recited about ten of his aliases all at once. As a result, the subcommittee formally issued a subpoena, requiring Dennis to testify before the committee at a set time, temporarily ending the small storm.</p>
<h3>Anti-Communist Wave is Still Growing</h3>
<p>The anti-communist wave in the United States is still growing, and there will likely be many more exciting performances in the congressional review meetings in the coming days. However, judging from various aspects, it is probably impossible to simply legislate to ban the Communist Party. First, the Constitution explicitly stipulates that the basic rights of the people cannot be violated. Even in wartime, the Supreme Court did not allow this precious doctrine to be slightly damaged for any reason, let alone in peacetime? Therefore, it seems that the Communist Party can rest easy knowing that the law protects its existence. Second, according to various sources, there is actually no determination in Congress to legislate to ban the Communist Party. Most people believe that even if the law does not cause problems, it will not help the matter. In particular, the Communist Party is prone to change. If you say you are banning the Communist Party today, they will immediately change their signboard tomorrow, or even drive it underground, making it even more difficult to deal with in the future. Third, although public opinion generally does not sympathize with the Communist Party's actions, in order to uphold the golden rule of democracy and freedom, most people do not advocate a hard ban. Newspaper letters have repeatedly emphasized the supreme principle of guaranteeing the Constitution. Even the chairman of the American Federation of Labor, Green, who has always spared no effort in attacking the Communist Party, told Congress that he does not advocate legislation to ban it in order to avoid infringing on basic principles. The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation also holds this view. After describing many hateful and accusatory words against the Communist Party, he concluded: "Our most effective countermeasure is to ensure the implementation of an effective democratic system that guarantees our true freedom."</p>
<h3>Anglo-Albanian Corfu Channel Dispute Submitted to International Law</h3>
<p>Albania Believes British Proposal is Unjustified</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 9th] The United Nations Security Council today adopted a British proposal to refer the British-Albanian minefield dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, with a vote of eight to zero. The Soviet Union and Poland abstained, and the United Kingdom, as a party to the dispute, did not participate in the vote. Albania opposed the British proposal. Chairman Guo Taiqi believed that since Albania agreed to accept the resolutions of the Security Council, it must abide by the decisions of the Security Council and the International Court of Justice. Albania is not a member of the United Nations, but if it agrees to abide by the decisions of the International Court of Justice, it may appear in court. This is the first time that a dispute before the Security Council has been referred to the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 9th] The Albanian representative told the United Nations Security Council today that the Albanian government refuses to submit the Albanian-British dispute over the Corfu Channel to the International Court of Justice for adjudication. Albania believes that the United Kingdom has no grounds and asks the Council to firmly reject the British request. Soviet representative Gromyko supported Albania and said that the Soviet Union also cannot agree to the International Court of Justice hearing the matter.</p>

<h3>First Price Evaluation Conference, High-Quality White Rice Limited to 140,000</h3>
<p>Restore Sugar Rationing for Household Registration, Cotton Yarn at 3.5 Million Per Piece</p>
<p>Request Central Government to Allocate 14,000 Tons of Soybeans Monthly to Suppress Oil Prices</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The first meeting of the Shanghai Price Evaluation Conference was held yesterday morning in the conference room of the Social Affairs Bureau. Members present included Xuan Tiewu, Yu Shuping, Qian Naixin, Xu Jilun, Wu Yunxun, Shui Xiangyun, Cheng Cangbo, Xu Caicheng, Ouyang Lun, etc. Also present were Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, and representatives from various sub-groups. Chairman Wu Kaixian presided over the meeting and provided a detailed analysis of the causes of price fluctuations. Director Gu then reported on the price negotiation situation over the past year. Xuan Tiewu, Xu Qi, and others then expressed their opinions.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Director Wu met with reporters and provided a detailed analysis of rice, oil, sugar, and cloth, stating: (1) Rice: When President Song was in office, he agreed to allocate 200,000 tons of stored rice to Shanghai to suppress rice prices at any time. Later, a total of 100,000 tons of the rice arrived, and the Ministry of Food allocated 70,000 tons for rationing to public and education personnel. Because the Social Affairs Bureau has limited grain reserves and the market is flooded with floating capital, it dares not sell off easily. Now, it is requesting the Ministry of Food to allocate the full 200,000 tons of stored grain as planned and requesting the Central Government to prohibit rice exports and prevent purchases to suppress prices in production areas. The negotiated price of medium-ripe rice in this city has been adjusted from 121,000 to 130,000 based on the actual situation, and high-quality white rice has been adjusted from 120,000 to 140,000. (2) Oil: The price of soybean oil must be controlled from the price of soybeans. Currently, the price of soybeans has risen to 110,000 per unit. Based on the principle that three units of soybeans produce one unit of oil, and all processing fees are offset by soybean cake, then 331,000 per unit, which is 3,300 yuan per pound, is required. In fact, the manufacturing cost is 4,350 yuan per pound. The previous limited price was 2,500 yuan per pound, so all oil factories felt that they could not maintain it. The Central Government originally supplied this city with 8,000 tons of soybeans per month at a price of 50,000 per unit, but this number is not enough for this city's needs, so it is specifically requested to increase the allocation by 6,000 tons per month. Only in this way can the oil market be absolutely controlled and the price of 2,500 yuan per pound be maintained. (3) Sugar: Sugar merchants previously requested a 50% increase in sugar prices because the weather was warming and there would be more outlets. The Price Evaluation Conference believed that the sugar merchants were not manufacturers but intermediaries and that the reasons given were insufficient, so the request was rejected. Currently, the black market price of sugar is about 3,200 to 3,400 per pound. It has been decided to restore sugar rationing for household registration in April, with a price of about 2,000 per pound. (4) Cloth: The price of cloth must be controlled from the price of cotton. Currently, the market price of cotton is 1 million per unit. Based on the principle that three and a half units of cotton produce one piece of cloth, then excluding expenses, 3.5 million is required. The current limited price is 3.5 million. Unless the Central Government provides subsidies, merchants feel that they cannot maintain it. Therefore, the Central Government has been requested to accurately determine a price for cotton. In addition, the prices of fuel and flour will remain unchanged. Director Wu will submit the above decisions to the municipal government meeting this morning for filing.</p>

<h3>Sugar Rationing for Public and Education Personnel Begins Selling Yesterday</h3>
<p>The distribution of sugar rations for public and education personnel in this city for March has been handled by the Shanghai South Goods Merchants Association, which has taken delivery from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. A total of 1,100 packages of No. 1 cotton white sugar began to be distributed yesterday. All public and education personnel from various agencies can purchase the sugar at nearby participating stores by presenting their purchase certificates. All 36 participating stores have a sign indicating "Food Essence Rationing Point" and have sugar samples on display. The regulations stipulate that staff and police officers receive two pounds each, and police constables and workers receive one pound each, at a price of 2,000 yuan per pound.</p>

The City Government has received the City Council's letter regarding this resolution and issued a notice to all subordinate bureaus yesterday.</p>
<h3>Disaster of the Sinking of the Fu Bo Warship, Prosecutors Investigate the Hai Min Vessel</h3>
<p>Reportedly Summons Relevant Crew Members Today</p>
<p>Regarding the tragic sinking of the Fu Bo gunboat, the Navy Headquarters believes that the Hai Min vessel, which caused the accident, has a mutual rescue responsibility according to maritime law in the event of a collision between two ships. Because the vessel failed to provide rescue when the gunboat was in distress, causing the gunboat's naval personnel to tragically perish, the Navy Headquarters has requested the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate the captain of the Hai Min vessel, Dai Rulin, in accordance with Article 128 of maritime law and Article 370 of criminal law. The District Prosecutor's Office dispatched bailiffs to arrest Dai Rulin on the night before last at 11:00 PM and escorted him to the District Prosecutor's Office, where Prosecutor Cao Hong presided over the interrogation until he adjourned at 12:00 AM. Due to the seriousness of the case, the defendant Dai Rulin was detained in the District Court Detention Center that night. It is understood that during the interrogation, the defendant flatly denied failing to provide rescue. In order to conduct a thorough investigation, Prosecutor Cao Hong, accompanied by Clerk Chen Zhaiyan, Interpreter Xu Shaoyong, Staff Officer Cheng Ding from the Navy Headquarters, Military Judge Chen Shimao, and Engineer Yang Yuanchi from the Naval Shipyard, went to the Longhua Naval Shipyard at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The Navy Headquarters provided a speedboat to approach the Hai Min vessel and inspect the damaged bow and stern sections of the vessel. They then boarded the ship, guided by the acting captain of the vessel, Yu Zhixiang, to investigate the bow, midships, bridge and other locations, and Engineer Yang explained the details and researched them carefully, and inspected the vessel's life-saving equipment. They left the ship and returned north at about 5:00 PM. The District Prosecutor's Office has scheduled a continued court investigation at 9:30 AM today and will summon relevant persons, including Chief Mate Wu Nianzu of the Hai Min vessel, on-duty crew member Wu Kan, helmsman Wu Fuqing, Liu Fenfa, lookout seaman Ma Fugen, and passengers Zheng Guiren, Sun Junhua, Jiang Jixin, and Luo Qianzun. The summonses were issued yesterday.</p>
<h3>Tongji University Continues Strike, Four Resolutions, Renewed Petition</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] After earnest persuasion by the school authorities, the striking students of Tongji University originally planned to resume classes today. However, upon seeing the rectified letter from the involved soldiers and the distorted remarks made by the school board member to the Central News Agency as reported in yesterday's newspapers, they felt quite dissatisfied and decided to continue the strike. At 2:00 PM yesterday, they held a second representative meeting in the College of Engineering. In addition to representatives from various departments of the university, representatives from the affiliated middle school, senior vocational school, and nursing school also participated. The following resolutions were made immediately: (1) Demand that the responsible authorities apologize in major Shanghai newspapers. (2) Immediately detain, investigate, and punish the involved officers and soldiers. (3) Withdraw troops from the campus within a time limit. (4) Provide a public written guarantee that the same incident will not occur again in the future. According to student representatives, they have decided to petition the port headquarters again this morning. If there is no result, they will expand their actions. The Student Union will also hold a reception for reporters at the College of Arts at 191 North Sichuan Road at 2:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Capital Refuses to Pay Difference, Social Affairs Bureau Transfers to Evaluation Committee for Handling, Wu Kaixian Says Labor Union Can File a Lawsuit</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] In recent days, some capitalists have refused to pay the difference. Industries going to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition include mechanical sewing, carving woodware, umbrella manufacturing, mirror frame manufacturing, Western clothing, and women's Western clothing. The Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau has transferred the relevant cases to the Labor-Capital Evaluation Committee for handling. Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau expressed his opinion on this matter, stating: "If capitalists have such illegal situations, the labor union can file a lawsuit with the court." Currently, the most disputes are caused by the issue of the difference for child labor. Anyone under the age of 16 is treated as a minor worker. However, the work efficiency of child labor in tobacco factories is mostly higher than that of adults, while the difference is less, so there are many disputes. However, according to labor law regulations, child labor is not based on work efficiency as the standard but on age, so it cannot be changed.</p>
<h3>New Finance Director Tian Yongqian Takes Office, Very Few Personnel Changes</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The handover ceremony between the old and new directors of the Municipal Finance Bureau was held in the bureau's conference room at 10:00 AM yesterday. A total of more than 50 heads of various management departments and sections attended. After the former director, Gu Chunfan, introduced the new director, Tian Yongqian, to the staff, he gave a farewell speech, expressing his gratitude for the cooperation of all colleagues in the past. Tian then delivered a speech, stating: "Although I have worked in finance in the past, Shanghai is an international city, and the environment is different. I deeply fear that due to my shallow knowledge, I will not be able to fulfill this position. Fortunately, Director Gu has already established a good foundation. In the future, I hope that my colleagues will provide more assistance and continue to follow the established rules." After he finished speaking, Geng Meizhang, the second section head of the Municipal Government Accounting Office, supervised the handing over of the seal, and the ceremony concluded. Gu left by car, and the staff bid him farewell. Reporters then asked the new director what changes there would be in the bureau's affairs and personnel. He replied: "This time, I have accepted the invitation of a friend to take charge of the finance staff, not to become an official. Therefore, except for the head of the cash management team, who was originally concurrently the head of the audit section, has resigned from the concurrent position and Wu Zhuang has been appointed to succeed him, and one seal has been commissioned, there are no other changes. In the future, due to the fact that the bureau's affairs have just begun, I will refrain from saying more."</p>

<h3>Catastrophe on Dapu Road, Truck Fire, Spreads and Causes Disaster, Nearly 200 Shanties Destroyed, 3,000 Homeless, Four Tragic Deaths, Many Burned</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] At about 3:00 PM yesterday, a truck loaded with film reels suddenly caught fire at the entrance of Dabingyue at No. 62 Dapu Road in southern Shanghai, causing a major disaster that spread and destroyed about 170-180 nearby shanties and burned to death four residents, both adults and children. Dapu Road is located between Xiexu Road and Xujiahui Road. The area is densely packed with shanties, with hundreds of them, which are the residences of general laborers, rickshaw pullers, small shopkeepers, and workers. At about 3:00 PM yesterday, a truck from Huali Transportation Company (license plate number 36561) was driven by driver Li Ada (from Yancheng, 33 years old), carrying a large number of film reels in iron barrels, speeding south to north. When it arrived at the entrance of Dabing Store at No. 62 of the road, it suddenly noticed that the rear of the truck had caught fire. At that time, Li Ada urgently stopped the engine. Seeing the catastrophe, he and five workers, Lu Zhaozhong, Lin Ruifu (both with burned hands and backs), Gu Yunsheng (injured hands and feet), Wang Yunfu (injured right hand and head), and Wang Rujin (injured head), abandoned the car and fled. The fire in the car was strong, and flames were flying in an instant. In addition to the film reels and the car body being burned, the fire spread to nearby shanties, destroying as many as 170-180 of them. From Xiexu Road in the south to Xujiahui Road in the north, the area has been burned into a white land, and as many as 3,000 residents have been displaced.</p>
<h3>Six Dead and Injured at Shengli Restaurant</h3>
<p>The most tragic losses were at the Shengli Restaurant. There were six deaths and injuries in the whole family. It is reported that Zhang Zhiqin (32 years old), Wang Zhichao (11 years old, Zhang’s nephew), Qiao Xin (52 years old), and Qiu Yizhang (43 years old) died in the fire. Zhang Zuoyinkun, his wife Zhang Tian, and an apprentice were also seriously burned and in critical condition. Chen Yutai grocery store and smoke paper shop, and a small tea house and Dabing shop were also completely destroyed. Huainan Elementary School and Public School have slight losses. At the same time, Lu Zongren, a petitioner from China Textile No. 6 Printing and Dyeing Factory at No. 80 Dapu Road, was burned in the head and hands and sent to the hospital for treatment by the factory. The factory was not affected, which was really fortunate. After the fire broke out, the Central, Xinkaihe, Taishan, Wuxing, and Nanshi fire brigades rushed to the scene, and the fire was extinguished at about 7:00 PM. After receiving the report, the Lugiawan Police Department, led by the deputy director Zhao Peijin, and Sun Siming, along with section chief Hao Jingyi, patrol officer Ni Jiafeng, and all the police and auxiliary police, arrived at the scene to suppress the situation.</p>
<h3>The Arsonist Driver Was Arrested</h3>
<p>After the driver Li Ada and the workers fled, section chief Hao immediately ordered patrol officer Ni to find out that the truck with license plate number 36561 belonged to the Huali Transportation Company. He then led the police to the company at 21 Yuanchang Lane, Liling Road, Hongkou. He further found out that the car was actually jointly purchased by Wu Guangfu and Lu Lao San, who lived at 34 Qingyu Lane, East Changzhi Road, and was operated under the company's banner. He then turned to the address and found out that the driver lived at No. 4 Xijiazhai, Guangxing Wharf, Yangshupu. He rushed to the place and arrested Li. Li also confessed that the five workers were receiving treatment at a small hospital in Tilanqiao. He then went to the hospital and brought the five workers back to the bureau for interrogation. According to the confession, "The film reels were handed over by the Asia Customs Brokerage on Guangdong Road, Sichuan Road and were to be transported from the Kaiping Wharf on Rihui East Road to Bailinan Road in western Shanghai." As for the cause of the fire, the police are still investigating. However, there are many rumors at the scene of the fire, saying that someone got on the car and accidentally threw a cigarette butt onto the rosin-based film roll, causing the fire.</p>

<h3>Wuxi People's Daily Reports Destruction, Asks for Support from Local Colleagues</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The Wuxi People's Daily was destroyed by a group of students from a frontier school the day before yesterday because it published a news article about a "ticket supplement dispute." Yesterday, all newspapers in Wuxi jointly suspended publication for one day to show their protest. Sun Xiangfeng, the president of the People's Daily, held a reception at the Xinghualou Restaurant in this city yesterday afternoon to report the incident to local colleagues and to appeal to them to support the newspaper because news businesses and employees across the country have been repeatedly beaten and destroyed, and freedom of the press has been severely undermined, which is a matter of concern for the entire press. He also asked the authorities to thoroughly investigate and deal with the incident in order to seek effective protection in the future. President Sun also said: This news article was worded very carefully and did not offend the teachers and students of the frontier school. However, at about 4:00 PM, Ye Peizhang and another teacher from the school went to the newspaper office and demanded correction and apology in a rude manner. The newspaper asked them at the time where exactly in the article was untrue? Where must it be corrected? In addition to the fact that the school's students went to the Soviet Union for travel and were mistaken for returning to Wuxi from Shanghai, the rest could not be answered. The two then flicked their sleeves and left. Unexpectedly, in less than ten minutes, more than 100 students from the school, divided into two large trucks, carrying</p>

<p>New Medicines and Vaccines for Preventing Tuberculosis: “BCG” by Wang Mingqin</p>
<p>Recently, news and magazine articles about new drugs for treating tuberculosis have frequently appeared. However, when we mention the word "consumption" (tuberculosis), it still makes people feel as if they are facing a tiger, causing fear. The reason is that tuberculosis bacteria often invade your lungs unknowingly, gradually developing and spreading until they eventually rot away your lungs beyond repair. Nevertheless, humanity is intelligent, so decades ago, people began researching methods to combat tuberculosis, and as a result, "BCG" was discovered. However, for the past twenty years, we seem to have forgotten this weapon against pulmonary tuberculosis. Until recently, European and American countries have been diligently researching it again. Although its efficacy is not yet fully established, its contribution to the history of medicine is indelible. Many people, especially infants, have relied on its power to avoid being struck down by this "white plague."</p>
<p>Since the power of "BCG" is so astonishing, the cost is very low. In the United States, each dose costs less than ten cents. Its usage is also very simple, with few reactions after administration. However, its manufacturing is time-consuming, which is its only drawback.</p>
<p>The common practices of getting vaccinations, receiving serum injections, and variolation are medically known as immunization. "BCG" is similar to the smallpox vaccine. The smallpox vaccine involves inoculating smallpox bacteria into a cow. Gradually, the cow's skin develops pox scars. The fluid inside these scars is extracted, ground, and made into a glycerol suspension, which is the smallpox vaccine. Therefore, the main component of the smallpox vaccine is live smallpox bacteria. However, these bacteria are not the original ones; they have been "reincarnated" once, and their virulence has been weakened. So, when inoculated into humans, they do not cause danger, but their other power – the ability to produce resistance – remains. Thus, when genuine smallpox bacteria invade the human body later, the resistance produced by vaccination comes into play, saving people from danger. The principle of "BCG" is the same as vaccination, but its production method is somewhat different. It also uses tuberculosis bacteria (tubercle bacilli), but instead of inoculating them into cows, they are cultured in a culture medium (a glycerin preparation of ox bile). After several years, the virulence of the bacteria gradually weakens to the point where they no longer cause danger to humans, but their ability to induce immunity remains. This is "BCG."</p>
<p>Why is it called "BCG"? What is the extent of its effectiveness? You can understand by looking at the following history. In 1908, two French scientists, Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin, inoculated a very small amount of tubercle bacilli into cows. As a result, they discovered that the cows developed considerable immunity to tuberculosis. So, they continued their research. Thirteen years later, they finally developed a method of long-term cultivation to gradually reduce the virulence of the bacteria so that it could be used in humans. This is the so-called "Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin." Because the first three letters of its English name, Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin, are "BCG," it is called "BCG."</p>
<p>This new discovery shook the whole of Europe. It was greatly welcomed by various countries, such as France, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Infants whose mothers had pulmonary tuberculosis were given "BCG" orally within ten days of birth. The British Ministry of Health even decided to set up a laboratory to manufacture this vaccine. However, in the New World, "BCG" was not well-received. Because in 1930, an unfortunate incident occurred in Lubeck, Germany. Two hundred and fifty infants died within a few months after being inoculated with "BCG." Although later investigation revealed that the culture medium had been accidentally contaminated with highly virulent tubercle bacilli, Americans have avoided using this method ever since. This was partly because European scientists could not yet control its efficacy and partly because they feared another unfortunate incident. However, now the United States is also paying attention to this almost-forgotten weapon against tuberculosis.</p>
<p>After research by many American scientists, they came to a common conclusion. That is, "BCG" cannot be hailed as a miraculous drug. It cannot cure, nor can it be considered an absolute preventative. However, in environments where contact with tubercle bacilli is easy, "BCG" is indeed the only good preventative medicine. In addition, there are three interesting experiments. In 1935, Dr. Aronson at the University of Pennsylvania spent six years selecting more than three thousand non-tuberculous Indian children from four tuberculosis-prone areas in the western United States and twelve communities in southern Alaska. He divided them into two groups; 1550 were injected with "BCG," and 1457 were secretly given saline solution instead of "BCG." Both groups lived in the same dirty huts, with equal opportunities for contact with tubercle bacilli. If "BCG" had no preventative effect, then the number of Indian people infected with pulmonary tuberculosis in both groups should be equal. However, Dr. Aronson found that among those Indians who died from tuberculosis, those injected with saline solution accounted for twenty-eight people, while those injected with BCG accounted for only four. At the same time, Dr. Ferguson spent five years using female nurses in hospitals and sanatoriums as experimental subjects. The results showed that nurses who had not been injected with BCG had a four times greater chance of contracting pulmonary tuberculosis than those who had been injected with "BCG." In addition, Dr. Joseph Bado randomly divided children in a tuberculosis-prone poor area into two groups, and they all lived in the same environment. Years later, Dr. Bado found that among children who had been injected with "BCG," the number who died from tuberculosis was 18.7 per thousand, and the number who contracted tuberculosis was 1.35 per thousand. As for those who had not been injected, the death rate was 47.4 per thousand, and the infection rate was 237 per thousand. From the above experimental reports, the effectiveness of "BCG" can be understood.</p>
<p>Finally, concerning the use of "BCG," it can be divided into two types. Infants use the oral method, because infants' skin is delicate and not suitable for injection, and infants' mucous membranes are easily absorbed. Children and adults mostly use subcutaneous injection. It is said that the Pasteur Institute branch in this city has already issued this vaccine. In addition, it is said that the Sino-Western Sanatorium on Bubbling Well Road has also been using this vaccine for quite some time.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Measles (Continued and Completed) by Xie Yunshou</h3>
<p>(3) The room should not be too bright, because patients with conjunctivitis are afraid of light, and window curtains can be used to block strong light.</p>
<p>(4) Rest quietly in bed. This should be done not only when there is a fever, but also for two or three weeks after the fever subsides. It is forbidden to move around outdoors. The custom of "measles patients not going out for a month" is indeed insightful.</p>
<p>(5) If children have tuberculosis, more attention should be paid to their health after measles, for about three months.</p>
<p>(6) The mouth, eyes, nasal cavity, etc., should be kept clean, and washed or gargled with boric acid water to avoid various complications.</p>
<p>(7) Of course, easily digestible liquid foods should be chosen.</p>
<p>(8) If the fever does not subside after the rash is fully developed, or if there are any other changes, the doctor should be notified quickly for appropriate treatment. Delaying treatment is not advisable.</p>
<p>What is the most terrible thing about measles? It is a type of complication. Among the complications, the most common and dangerous is measles bronchitis, which leads to measles pneumonia. It mostly occurs in children under five years old, especially in young children with weak constitutions. The child's face suddenly turns pale, sometimes becoming cyanotic, with difficulty breathing, high fever, and restlessness. What people commonly refer to as "the measles not coming out or sinking inward" is mostly this situation. Measles combined with pneumonia often occurs when the measles rash is most vigorous. Sometimes, after measles has progressed smoothly and the fever has subsided, fever recurs, triggering pneumonia. The prognosis is mostly poor. Even if the pneumonia is treated properly, it will delay the recovery period of measles.</p>
<p>Secondly, is intestinal dysfunction, resulting in dysentery-like diarrhea, with increased bowel movements, and stools that are mucous and watery. Sometimes it even combines with true dysentery, leaving the child in a miserable state.</p>
<p>The third is nephritis, with reduced urination, facial edema, and protein in the urine, but not as much as during scarlet fever. The fourth is whooping cough. Measles combined with whooping cough makes the prognosis very poor. The fifth is latent tuberculosis, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous lymphadenitis, etc., which are often delayed and enlarged due to measles. This is commonly called "sha lao," and can even lead to miliary tuberculosis, resulting in rapid death. The sixth is eye disease, such as conjunctivitis, blepharitis, commonly called "sha zi yan," which can even lead to ulcerative keratitis, resulting in blindness. The seventh is severe stomatitis, which can even combine with noma (i.e., cancrum oris), leading to sepsis and death. The eighth is pharyngitis, which sometimes turns into aphonia, and can even combine with true diphtheria. I have already written about many complications above, so I say that the measles itself is not terrible; what is terrible are the complications!</p>

<h3>The Mystery of New Chinese Medicine (2) by Hong Guanzhi</h3>
<p>(2) The Mysticism and Experience of Chinese Medicine</p>
<p>Before discussing the issue of scientificization, we must first analyze the "essence" of Chinese medicine. The theory of Chinese medicine is based on "mysticism" built on empty speculation. Yin and Yang, the Five Elements, the Five Movements, the Six Qi, Interior and Exterior, Ascending and Descending, Floating and Sinking, etc., are all starting points of Chinese medicine theory. However, these terms are products of "metaphysics" (although they cannot represent everything in metaphysics). Derived from this speculation is "mysticism." Looking at all Chinese medicine books throughout history, whether physiology, symptoms, medicinal properties, or therapeutic effects, they are all explained using this terminology. Therefore, the theory of Chinese medicine is "mysticism," which is undeniable. Mr. Lu, in his article "Experience and Metaphysics," made a grand statement, saying:</p>
<p>"What is called metaphysics? How can Chinese medicine be metaphysical? Flipping through the dictionary, metaphysics is the study of Taoism, which of course has nothing to do with Chinese medicine. Another meaning is Meta-physiscs, also known as metaphysics, which leads to the realm of philosophy... I don't understand metaphysics, which is the first philosophy... I don't understand, what does Chinese medicine have to do with this..."</p>
<p>Mr. Lu's words are aimed at Mr. Fan Shouyuan's statement in the People's Medical Journal that Chinese medicine is metaphysics. Yes, Chinese medicine is not philosophical, and the object of medicine is "people," who are tangible and qualitative beings. Naturally, it is not "metaphysical," and naturally, it cannot and should not be speculated or studied using "metaphysical methods." However, Mr. Lu has clearly overlooked the other aspect of the interpretation of "metaphysics." It is acceptable to say that Chinese medicine is not "the entirety of metaphysics," but the other interpretation of "metaphysics" is the teachings of Taoism, which cannot be said to have nothing to do with Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine theory is deeply influenced by Taoism. This is a fact, and terms such as Yin and Yang, the Five Elements, generation and destruction, etc., are the basis of Chinese medicine's basic theory. Take the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic, for example, most of it has the breath of Taoism. Even now, the theories often used in Chinese medicine prescriptions are incarnations of this kind of "mysticism." Can you still say that this kind of Taoist "mysticism" has nothing to do with Chinese medicine? Please do not forget your ancestors, this "mysticism" is the ancestor of Chinese medicine! I think Mr. Fan's statement that "Chinese medicine is metaphysics" is already a compliment to Chinese medicine (in fact, the theory of Chinese medicine is not enough to represent the entirety of metaphysics), which led Mr. Lu to take the opportunity to elaborate and talk about the metaphysics of philosophy. Since medicine is the "science" of "people," there is no "medicine" allowed in the realm of metaphysics. In fact, the theory of Chinese medicine is a vague and empty speculation, so this kind of "mysticism" is neither science nor philosophy, and does not even qualify as "metaphysics." What I said above can also serve as a partial answer to "What is Chinese medicine"!</p>
<p>Secondly, what Chinese medicine relies on is the so-called "experience." In the past, the Chinese medicine community always said that Chinese medicine was philosophical or scientific, but now there is a realization that this view is incorrect. Moreover, clinical practice in Chinese medicine can originally put aside the theory of "mysticism," so what does it rely on to diagnose and treat? It can only be said to use "experience," and greatly exaggerate the achievements of "experience" to contend with science. To say that the essence of Chinese medicine originally comes from experience, experience is valuable, and especially to say that Chinese medicine is "experimental" is a view that has only become popular in recent decades, because attaching to philosophy, science, or art does not work. However, everyone should not overlook the essence of "experience." We have never found in Chinese medicine literature the statement that Chinese medicine is a product of "experience." If there is any, there are only dozens of prescription books that sometimes label something as "experimental good prescriptions" or "experimental prescriptions." However, these "experimental prescriptions" were collected casually by predecessors, and in fact, they are not all effective. I'm afraid that the word "experience" is rarely found in other medical classics! However, relying solely on a few book titles cannot be used as an argument that Chinese medicine is "experimental." Everyone knows that the so-called saying of an experimental good prescription is only saying that it is a prescription that has been tried by someone, and there is nothing to be surprised or overjoyed about. In fact, it is well known that "experimental prescriptions" are not very effective, and I really don't understand what glory there is in saying that Chinese medicine is "experimental." However, to put it another way, the "experience" they speak of does not refer to the experience of "experimental good prescriptions," but is associated with the "empiricism" of philosophy, and believes that everything in Chinese medicine is "experimental" and does not only refer to prescriptions. Therefore, it is indeed valuable, and in principle, experience should be valuable. One can know its meaning at a glance, so what is the need for explanation? However, the "experience" we usually talk about, for example, saying that someone is experienced in handling affairs, whether in social aspects or in technical aspects, all belongs to personal "experience" and is not knowledge, nor does it contain the meaning of absolute reliability or "effectiveness." As for the term "experience" in philosophy, it is translated from Western languages and has two interpretations: The previous empiricism referred to the subjective empiricism of "personally experiencing the matter and directly recognizing the object through human senses." However, the new philosophical theory now states, "Knowledge obtained by observing phenomena in objective reality, or by artificially setting conditions and experimenting on the phenomena to be studied in the laboratory, is experience." In other words, the result of experimentation is true experience. We know that the Western word Experiment is also translated as "experience." Mr. Yu Yunxiu said that experience is subjective, and Mr. Lu came to refute him, saying that there is also "experience" based on observation and experimentation. Indeed, Mr. Yu did not mention another interpretation of experience in his article on experience, which is his shortcoming and also a temporary oversight in his writing. We cannot say that he does not know the other meaning of the original Western word for experience. Since Mr. Yu's argument is based on subjective experience, he said that experience is not valuable, and those who rely solely on experience for technology are mediocre and unworthy of mention. However, not mentioning experience does not mean that it can be abandoned, which can be said to be a fair argument. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Separation in Spring and Autumn by Hungarian F. Molnar, translated by Yan Dachun</p>
<p>In a secluded path in the park, a man and a woman are wandering.</p>
<p>She: Now it can end. The time to separate has come. We have nothing more to do. Please kiss my hand, let's part as friends.</p>
<p>He: As you say.</p>
<p>She: Bester! We don't need anything except for each of us to keep those happiest, most intimate memories. We met, loved, kissed briefly, and now, we are both tired.</p>
<p>He: You are right. (He kisses her hand)</p>
<p>She: I will take the path on the right to leave. You wait a little while, and leave by the path on the left. Now that we are saying goodbye forever, it would be too much if my husband were to see us leaving together.</p>
<p>He: Goodbye! (Neither of them moves)</p>
<p>She: Why aren't you leaving?</p>
<p>He: First, I have something to ask you.</p>
<p>She: What?</p>
<p>He: Do you remember? The first time I met you, you were in Hohen Tatras. You were there for the winter with some girlfriends. Your husband wasn't with you, so I didn't meet him then.</p>
<p>She: I remember that was how it was.</p>
<p>He: You must recall that we immediately fell for each other. Later, we continued our intimacy in Patra Bester, where I still didn't meet your husband.</p>
<p>She: No.</p>
<p>He: But one day you brought me a photo, a photo of a handsome man. You said, "I brought you a photo of my husband. I know you must want to know what he looks like." I carefully examined the photo, and the man in it was as handsome as Delacroix, as elegant as Edward VII. His hair was curly, his eyebrows formed a beautiful semicircle, his eyes were sincere and upright, and he even had a mouth like a Greek god. I didn't tell you, but that night I didn't eat a thing.</p>
<p>She: I guessed as much.</p>
<p>He: And I couldn't sleep well. At that time, I was in love with you, so how could I be willing to humiliate myself in comparison? So, I eagerly examined my own appearance in the mirror. I knew that I was neither beautiful nor ugly, just an ordinary face. The kind of face you can see on any adjutant. Seeing this face, I was very troubled, very angry. I was determined to transform it into something good-looking by any means.</p>
<p>She: I noticed that.</p>
<p>He: In those sleepless nights, I often asked myself, since you have such a handsome husband, how could you still be interested in me? I comforted myself, "Maybe her husband is a fool." So, I made a further analysis, admitting that my intelligence didn't exceed the average person, and the man in the photo even showed a hint of intelligence. I simply couldn't understand how you could fall in love with me. I envied, envied the man in the photo, so I gradually entered the realm of fierce competition with the photo.</p>
<p>She: I knew you would.</p>
<p>He: I had the best tailors make clothes, and the best hairdressers curl my hair. I was madly jealous every second. I carefully paid attention to every detail of my appearance, striving to reach the point of beauty. Sometimes, you told me that you were going to a dance with your husband, and the thought of him in evening dress, how dashing he would be, made me furious.</p>
<p>She: I expected you would.</p>
<p>He: Whenever you were free, I always demanded that you be with me. Do you remember? Once, you told me that your husband had gone to London on business and would be back in two weeks. I simply didn't let you out of my sight for a moment.</p>
<p>She: Indeed, he did go to London.</p>
<p>He: When you reported to me that he had returned, I asked you to let me meet him when you had the chance, but you refused. I just wanted to meet him while he was there, but you refused. And so, it happened.</p>
<p>She: What?</p>
<p>He: Now I can tell you the truth. One afternoon, you were at my apartment, and a note fell out of your purse. After you left, I picked it up and looked at it. It was written to your mother, saying: Your husband and you have reserved a box at the opera house tomorrow night. When passing by her apartment tomorrow night, take her with you to see the show. You were going to send the note to your mother, but inadvertently dropped it at my house.</p>
<p>She: Really? Did I lose it at your house?</p>
<p>He: Really. The next night, naturally, I also went to the opera house to see the show. I saw you—you, your mother, and your husband—all sitting in the box.</p>
<p>She: You went too?</p>
<p>He: Is that all you want to say?</p>
<p>She: What else do you expect me to say? Don't put on airs. Let me continue. That night at the opera house, I discovered—I dare not say you deceived me—a slight error. Your beauty was about fifty to fifty-five years old, unbelievably ugly, hunchbacked, with disheveled hair. Forgive me for being honest, he really was indescribably ugly.</p>
<p>She: Ah... Ah...</p>
<p>He: You won't deny that he is your husband.</p>
<p>She: I won't deny it.</p>
<p>He: To be sure, I even inquired with friends who knew him.</p>
<p>She: He is my husband.</p>
<p>He: All right, then why did you play this comedy with me? Who exactly is that handsome young man in the photo you gave me?</p>
<p>She: I don't know. I bought that photo in London for a few shillings. I guess he might be some English nobleman.</p>
<p>He: What?</p>
<p>She: Answer that question yourself. This was my trick, a successful little trick. When you started competing with the photo, you increased your value by fifty percent. You indescribably improved yourself. That photo turned you into a handsome, elegant, and intelligent man. So, I loved you very much. It was a joy for me to improve your character.</p>
<p>He: Truly clever. I'm willing for you to do that. This is truly typical female ingenuity. But you must know, you were too careless.</p>
<p>She: How so?</p>
<p>He: You see, because of a carelessness, unintentionally dropping a note from your purse, you ruined a flawless marriage created by lies. The day I saw your husband—your real husband—I knew you were lying to me, and the excitement that I had put into making myself lovable for you was completely lost. I no longer needed to pay attention to those things. I praised myself, your husband was inferior to me. Therefore, I gradually neglected my appearance. My jealousy also diminished. My self-love began to cool down. As a result, the love was destroyed. If you hadn't dropped that note, I would definitely still be in love with you today.</p>
<p>She: (Softly) So, do you believe that a woman like me would unintentionally drop a note at your house?</p>
<p>He: What does that mean?</p>
<p>She: A woman who deceives her husband is extremely careful with notes. If I had been so careless, my husband would have found out about my affair long ago.</p>
<p>He: You mean you deliberately dropped that note?</p>
<p>She: Of course.</p>
<p>He: (Angrily) Why?</p>
<p>She: Please answer that question yourself too. I intentionally wanted you to see my husband, so that you would slowly cool down, until you became completely indifferent. Because I have always hated pretense. When I was tired of you, I dropped that note. So, your interest in me disappeared, and our intimacy could have a natural, peaceful, and friendly ending.</p>
<p>He: You wanted to end it, entirely for...</p>
<p>She: I had already decided to give that photo of the handsome English youth to another similar man. Goodbye, friend. Don't be angry. Some people's hearts should be manipulated like this: holding a photo and a note at the same time. Just as Maupassant said in "The Human Heart." Goodbye!</p>
<p>He gazes thoughtfully as she takes the path on the right and disappears around the bend.</p>
<h3>Landscape by Derain</h3>
<p>André Derain (1880-1954) is one of the three great masters of modern French painting. Since Cézanne's death, he and Picasso have been engaged in Cubism. To this day, his painting style has changed several times. Whether landscapes, figures, or still lifes, his compositions are exceptionally tight, his colors are infinitely varied, and his brushstrokes are simple and profound, with a masterly style. This work is a sketch for a stage set painted for an opera house in Morocco. It is different from his usual works. If there were no signature, it would be almost impossible to recognize it.

<h3>In Memory of President Yu Youren's 70th Birthday: The Origin of the Construction of the Minzhi Auditorium</h3>
<p>Next year is the 70th birthday of Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan. Comrades in Beijing initially discussed building the Youren Library in Xi'an for him. But Yu Youren objected, so they are separately planning to build the Minzhi Auditorium to show their admiration. The following explores its origins and supplements. (Reporter)</p>
<p>(Origin)</p>
<p>"Plowing and herding rivers and mountains, I wish to repay the nation with red blood; Crossing the river as a refugee, I write history of struggle; This year I accidentally meet Labor Day, Making firecrackers, an orphan with white hair."</p>
<p>"In the year of recognition of surrender, I suffered a hundred sorrows; The Zhongshan lineage cut off Ryukyu; The League arises to fight for all mankind, Not only singing and calling for Asia."</p>
<p>The above two poems were written by Mr. Yu Youren on his 67th birthday in Chongqing. They are also Mr. Yu's autobiography. From this we know that Mr. Yu had the ambition of plowing and herding rivers and mountains from his childhood. He also worked as a firecracker worker, representing the sound of the Chinese nation in its most pious or happiest moments. Even now, he does not only sing and call for Asia. Mr. Yu's achievements and writings are the most glorious page in the history of the Chinese nation. Mr. Yu's advocacy of standard cursive script bears a major mission for the construction of the new country. Mr. Yu is one who lives for art. Although Mr. Yu's hair is white, his spirit will always stand in front of us. Young people who see Mr. Yu become more passionate; old people who see Mr. Yu regain their youth; the sick and the weak who see Mr. Yu increase their courage to fight. Mr. Yu's health is not only not like an old man, but even surpasses that of a strong man. This symbolizes the ancient and great Chinese nation living forever – next year is Mr. Yu's 70th birthday. Mr. Yu recently sent a letter to a friend in Shaanxi saying: "Recently, I have devoted little effort to local cultural undertakings, and I want to establish a Jingguo Library in my old age." Establishing the Jingguo Library is Mr. Yu's concern for local culture, and how should we strive in our careers to repay the love and commemoration of this great man of the times? We want to build a great Youren Library in Xi'an, Shaanxi, and establish two branch libraries in Hanbei and Hannan. That is, to wish Mr. Yu longevity with Mr. Yu's heart of saving the world! And to complete our plan with the heart of fighting for all mankind. Respectfully request the powerful figures of the present era and the social elite to give us their strong assistance! Respectfully Yours.</p>
<p>(Supplement)</p>
<p>Mr. Yu heard about the above proposal and stopped it immediately, and told them that "The government will build a national library in Xi'an, which is large in scale. I am deeply grateful for your kindness, but I hope you will not engage in this duplicate undertaking at a time when the country is in great difficulty." The colleagues returned and agreed that Mr. Yu's intentions should not be violated, but we should express ourselves even more. It was unanimously agreed that Mr. Yu founded the Minzhi School in Xiguan, Sanyuan in the eighth year of the Republic of China. Since then, all his financial resources have been used for the school's facilities. Therefore, Mr. Yu has no permanent property in Shaanxi, and every time he returns, he uses the school as his home. To date, more than 5,000 people have graduated from primary and secondary schools, and they are either dedicated to education or serving society, and they can all abide by Mr. Yu's revolutionary spirit and struggle hard. Mr. Yu once planned to build a large auditorium for the school. After several years of planning, the bricks and wood were prepared, but it was interrupted by the War of Resistance. Since the turmoil, the old materials have been lost. Mr. Yu has always been concerned. Colleagues believe that the Minzhi School is a memorial site for Mr. Yu's leadership of the revolution in the Northwest, and will always be the spiritual fortress of revolutionary consciousness in the Northwest. Mr. Yu has supported it personally and has never requested assistance from the country. However, the construction of an auditorium has been delayed until now. Although Mr. Yu did not say anything, those who respect and love Mr. Yu, if they do not know it, it is fine, but if they know it and do not promote its completion, it is not only difficult for them to feel at ease, but also their unavoidable duty. Therefore, it was agreed to change the previous proposal to build the Youren Library to the Minzhi Auditorium. We hereby record this at the end of the proposal, and we hope for your public approval.</p>
<h3>Three Days of Qinhuai Poems by Chen Baohua</h3>
<p>The Xuanwu Lake is clear and full of energy,</p>
<p>The Zhubiao boats are gentle and passionate;</p>
<p>Lying down, watching the red sleeves play lightly,</p>
<p>As if soaring in the sky.</p>
<p>Beside the southern bank of the Taicheng Terrace, calling back the soul,</p>
<p>Everywhere the cock crows, recognizing the Six Dynasties;</p>
<p>Today I come after the fires of war,</p>
<p>Leaning on the building, idly enjoying the peace flute.</p>
<p>Strolling in the suburban hills, the white sun sets,</p>
<p>Pearls and shadows compete in beauty;</p>
<p>The bridge inscription and oath are still there,</p>
<p>Watching the plum blossoms in one tree.</p>
<p>The great cause of a thousand years is as long as the sky,</p>
<p>Looking up to the supreme only for the public good;</p>
<p>Standing quietly on the steps of the mausoleum,</p>
<p>The mountains are full of flowers and trees in the gentle breeze.</p>
<p>A piece of coolness sweeps the leaves from the building,</p>
<p>Today's people do not worry with the ancients;</p>
<p>Outside Hanxi Gate, the rough road,</p>
<p>How many times have I seen the chariot to Mochou?</p>
<p>The willows by the embankment are green and new,</p>
<p>Three days of Qinhuai, a spring scene;</p>
<p>Asking the oriole if it understands,</p>
<p>Who is the person standing in the wind?</p>
<h3>Night Talk by Gu Liu</h3>
<p>When the dense night fills the small house, fills the courtyard, fills the whole world...</p>
<p>Flowers of lamplight, one by one, bloom piece by piece.</p>
<p>Moving tired, aching legs, the traveler, for a speck of lamplight flashing at the end of the road, has great joy...</p>
<p>Not only those who light the way, but everyone loves lamplight: the white-haired old mother loves to turn the spinning wheel under an oil lamp; the children love the hand shadows projected on the white wall by the lamplight, or listen to their sister telling one beautiful fairy tale after another under the lamplight; the students love to recite their lessons before the lamp; young men and women love to keep watch over the lamplight, writing lines of passion with excited hearts...</p>
<p>Those who are illuminated by sunlight, those who are illuminated by fireflies, those who open a hole in the wall to borrow the neighbor's lamplight, how ardent and profound must their unrequited love for the lamp be!</p>
<p>Ah! Lamp! Why do you waste your blood in beautiful rooms, and why are you so stingy towards low, small earthen houses?</p>
<p>I understand, facing the silent lamplight serving in the darkness, I seem to hear the answer: The first person to invent the lamp was not biased! The lamp is not biased!...</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 313 by Ye Jingfeng</h3>
<p>"So, why not invite them to join our organization?" Tsurumi believes that his organization is most suitable for the needs of this turbulent situation; as long as they are talented, he wants to win them over. Has the He Party not tried to persuade them?"</p>
<p>"They don't agree?" Tsurumi asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"No, because they don't want to join any organization. They have a fixed plan, which is implemented in three steps: First, to promote the success of the first unit of the new village; second, to divide the trained people into many small groups, and build many new village units in poor rural areas; third, to develop to the border areas?...</p>
<p>"What if the Japanese don't let them develop?"</p>
<p>"…?" Zheng Yan did not understand the meaning of Tsurumi's words.</p>
<p>"I mean, if this large-scale landing takes place, China will inevitably be covered in corpses and blood will flow like rivers, so what new villages</p>
<h3>Lilienthal Appointed Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission</h3>
<p>Formally Approved by the U.S. Senate</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] The Senate today approved the appointment of David Lilienthal as Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission by a vote of 50 to 31. Mr. Lilienthal previously presided over the Tennessee Valley Authority.  Conservatives and progressives in the United States fought bitterly over his appointment for eleven weeks. Mr. Lilienthal finally prevailed.  The other appointed members of the Atomic Energy Commission are Bacher, Waymack, Pike, and Strauss. The commission has three tasks: (1) to manage national atomic production and fissile materials in the name of the United States; (2) to control all U.S. atomic energy research and development, whether in medicine, industry or science, including atomic weapons; and (3) to have the power to prosecute anyone who leaks atomic energy information that the commission deems should be kept secret.  The commission will also be assisted by a General Advisory Committee and a Military Liaison Committee organized by Army and Navy officers.</p>
<h3>300 British Fighter Planes Transferred to the Turkish Government</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th]  According to the agreement made with the British government during the visit of the Turkish military mission to England last August, Britain has supplied 300 fighter planes to Turkey. These aircraft are mostly the fastest fighter planes used by the Royal Air Force, such as the latest Spitfire, Mosquito, and Beaufighter, all of which are first-class fighters in the world. Britain plans to supply a total of 500 fighter planes to Turkey and expects to deliver them all to Turkey within six months. These aircraft are transferred directly from British Air Force bases to Turkish airfields.</p>
<h3>U.S. Telephone Labor Dispute Expected to End Soon</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 10th] The nationwide telephone labor dispute is increasingly likely to end soon. An agreement on the basis for resolving the labor dispute between long-distance telephone workers and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company has been established today, but it still needs to be approved by the decision-making committee of the National Federation of Telephone Workers, which is guiding the strike. Director Warren of the Mediation Board praised this basic agreement and said that the slow but steady progress made in the negotiations is expected to be replicated in meetings in other parts of the country.</p>
<h3>Several U.S. Warships Scheduled to Visit Australia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 9th] The U.S. Navy announced that several U.S. aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers are scheduled to visit Sydney, Australia, in the second half of May. The aircraft carriers are the 27,000-ton "Shangri-La" and "Antietam", along with two light cruisers, eight destroyers, and two auxiliary ships.</p>
<h3>U.S. Communist Party Secretary-General Refuses to Attend House Hearing</h3>
<p>May Be Charged with Contempt of Congress</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 9th] U.S. Communist Party Secretary-General Dennis today refused to attend the House Un-American Activities Committee, submitting only a formal statement, in which he argued that the committee was not a "legitimate congressional committee" and therefore should not issue subpoenas. The Un-American Activities Committee considers this an act of contempt of Congress and resolved in a meeting today to ask the Justice Department to investigate the possibility of prosecuting Dennis for "willful contempt". If this charge is upheld, Dennis will face a maximum sentence of two years in prison and a fine of $10,000.</p>
