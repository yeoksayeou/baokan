<h3>美國會將討論援華　救濟糧食年內運滬　周以德謁主席暢談政局</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓三日電〕此間三日報告，美參議院主席范登堡，本週返此後，國務院對魏德邁將軍對華報吿書所採取之秘密作風，將被提十七日舉行之特別國會討論。恭牙范氏者將有參院外交委員會及發款委員會若干委員，彼等主張政府供給國會以援外用途計劃之全部情形，有關中國之計劃亦應包括在內。據稱，一部份參議員感覺，美國在馬歇　援歐計劃一事吿一段落前，正在對援華一事開慢車。彼等希望獲悉，加強中國國民政府反共力量一事，究將需要多少金元與貨品。彼等希望一睹魏德邁之建議，蓋彼等相信魏氏建議大規模援華。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕根據中美救濟協定所運首批援華糧食，年內可望運抵上海。此舉對平抑糧價，當大有裨助。根據協定，美將助我糧食二十萬噸，其巾米十二萬噸，麥八萬噸，醫藥物品五百萬美金。又悉，我另在美採購之糧食，首批亦將於年內運抵上海，並將在滬出售，以抑糧價，並以所得價款，在國內產區購糧，運　災區難胞。</p>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕蔣主席於三日下午五時接見美議員周以德，周氏由司徒大使陪往，儘量以國語與主席攀談，問由沈秘書昌煥翻譯，對中國現局多所交換索見。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕司徒大使與美議員周以德，已於昨晨九時許飛京。周氏定今日再度來滬，將接見各界人士，交換時局意見，明日專機返美，準備參加本月十七日之特別國會。</p>
<h3>周以德向會琦表示　返國後即呼籲援華</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕美議員周以德，三日下午二時在美大使館約晤中國靑年黨主席曾琦及該黨中委謝澄平，曾氏提出兩點：　自馬歇爾將軍返美後，美國對華政策意存觀望，原因何在，竊所不解，　中國地廣人衆，對世界和平之關係至少不在土。希之下，何以美竟置援華爲緩岡？周氏答謂：美國對華與論確有未盡了解之處，其故由於過去來華記者，其中不少左傾份子，特有成見，故多曲解，一時人民頗感惶惑，惟現已逐漸明朗，傾向援華。本人在國會曾四次呼籲援華，　國後仍當繼續努力，並詢曾氏援華以何種方式爲最妥善？會氏答謂：援華定爲全面的，即包含經齊，軍事，政治各項，而經濟又分兩種：（甲）爲政治性的貸款，（乙）爲經濟性的貸款，前者雖爲有限的，後者不妨無限，因中國本身固當力求「自力更生」，而友邦之「善意援助」，亦爲吾人所歡迎。曾氏並請周氏注意援華之「緊急性」與「時間性」。周氏爲習醫者。曾氏又以　爲喩，謂一種可治之病，若不及時用藥，則將不免有　躋之悔，周氏表表示同感，二氏晤談約卅分鐘。</p>
<h3>美應充裕國內市塲　支援友邦富强　周以德論美對外政策</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕美衆院外委會議員周以德，三日晨與司徒大使偕返首都，並即於十一時假大使官邸招待記者，周氏首就美國對華政策廣泛發言，調渠不知美政府現在考慮者爲何？然個人意見認爲應多予援助。渠不明政府對魏德邁將軍報吿必須保守秘密之理由，報吿中叙述部份容或有關機密僅供政府參考，然建議部份則毫無不公開之理由。渠認白宮此項揹施，令美國人民不知渠等所作何事。倘如渠等爲恐公布魏氏建議將影　　會對馬歇爾國務卿援歐計劃之考慮，則此項決定誠屬一有害之錯誤。馬歡爾計劃將以兩百億美金援歐，而於遠東分文亳無，殊屬不公，更難免偏失之處。遠東方面，日本已失去自衛之能力，韓國陷入逆境，如中國不能爲美國在東方之强力盟國，美國在日韓將　續消耗力量，而無法獲致一安定之局面。故美國之對華政策應從速確定，發表並予食行。至於美國近時物價高漲是否將延誤其對外援助一點，渠承認極爲重要。渠稱若　國家（尤其蘇聯　國），　　傳美國即將遭遇不景氣危機，然彼等仍希望自美獲得貸款或其他援助。美國如援助他國，當須冒不景氣與高物價之危險，但如不援助他國，許多獨立國家必將逐漸因經濟危機而不堪支特以至渝落。美國於此必須選擇一適當路途，一方增產充裕國內市塲，一方施援支持友邦獨立。此將爲國會愼重考慮之點。（下接二版一欄）</p>

<h3>于斌在美演說　中國境內並非打內戰　係反抗國際共產團體</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約三日廣播：費城訊，于斌主敎三日在此間向敎士發表演說稱：中國境內之戰爭並非內戰，而係反抗國際共產團體之戰爭。目下中國軍隊正在中國北部與一百萬共產黨徒作戰，其中有朝鮮人，日本人及蘇聯人混雜其間。渠並謂，中國當務之急，乃在促使美國明瞭中國並非在打內戰，而係與共產主義作戰，且方成爲新的侵略之犧牲者。此在共產黨方面，亦不稱呼此種戰事爲內戰，而名之爲民主主義與共產主義世界性戰爭之初步衝突。</p>
<h3>緬甸派員來華　籌備設大使館</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕外交界息：中緬決定互換大使後，緬甸除派宇　遇任爲首任駐華大使外，近並任命沙邦瓦爲一等秘書，李若溫爲三等秘書，沙李二氏已於一日由緬飛港，勾留旬日後，即啓程來京，籌備設館工作。</p>
<h3>金鈔買賣處罰條例　財部與有關方面商討修正</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕黃金外幣賈賣處罰條例，自本年四月　公布施行以來，前後已逾半載，其間需要修正之處甚多，現正由財部及有關方面商討中。聞生要需要修正之處有下列數點：　處罰對象，根據原條例一二兩條，僅限於未受政府允准買賣金鈔之行莊，財部認範圍過狹，主張將地下錢莊等列人。　原條例第三條規定，沒收　察持有人金鈔，財部認爲金鈔交易係　買　方行爲，應雙方同加處罰，僅懲處一方，未免不公。　原條例第七條規定，携外幣進口應有限制，財部認携帶外幣入境至多不得超過一百美金，立法方面認百元太少，至僑胞過境，財部已規定超出百元之數可存放海關，於三四十日內憑證取回。</p>
<h3>蔣主席電賀　巴拿馬國慶　阿當汗國王函謝主席</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京三日電〕三日爲巴拿馬國慶日，蔣主席會電巴總統吉米尼致賀。</p>
<p>〔又電〕外交界息：十月十六日爲阿富汗國王柴布爾誕辰，蔣主席曾去電致賀。頃悉，阿外長特於日前致函我駐阿公使，請其向最崇敬之蔣主席轉致阿王謝忱</p>
<h3>孫立人抵台　訓練檢討會在屛東召開</h3>
<p>〔本報台北三日電〕孫立人偕美顧問鮑林上校等七人，隨員四人三日下午二時四十分中滬乘專機抵台。孫氏定四日飛屛東，召開訓練檢討會，惟高雄營房尙在趕修，預算需五億台元。美軍事顧問團空軍中校藍茲（Rentz）等三人，則係十二時專機抵台，將訪郝中和空軍司令，商談訓練事宜。</p>
<h3>中荷空運協定　兩國即可批準</h3>
<p>〔本報南京三日電〕中荷空中運輸協定，即可由兩國政府批准。此一協定本年七月初業已談妥，當時荷方曾建議以香港爲中間站，我方未予同意，聞將來主要航行地區將以荷印爲第一，蓋該地僑胞極衆，對我關係亦深，協定簽字後，將先開闢巴達維亞。泗水及中國聞航綫。</p>
<h3>琉球島歸還我國　菲律賓竟表反對　並要求台灣「自決」前途</h3>
<p>〔合　社馬尼刺三日電〕馬尼刺公報三日稱：菲律賓將反對任何使琉球歸還中國之運動。菲外交部官員稱：該國代表將在對日和會中反對此項建議，以及將此事提交聯合國。據稱：菲官方反對此建議之原因，乃由於若琉球島置於一個外國管轄下，菲律賓地位可能陷於危險。菲律賓將要求琉球島置於託管下，並將要求台灣之政治地位，由其「自決」。另一官員稱：美國可能不願放棄琉球島之統治。</p>
<p>〔中央社馬尼刺三日電〕關於馬尼刺公報所載菲律賓反對我國收回琉球之要求事，菲外長季里諾曁外次艾佛立加，今晨皆未表示意見。外部與總統府之其他官員稱：渠等「絕未聞及此事」，故不能加以證實或否認。但據記者從其他方面獲悉：菲政府確有反對意圖，且遠在張羣院長於國民參政會駐委會宣佈中國將要求收回琉球以前，菲外部某官員即已擬就菲對此表示反對之計劃。此間觀察家對菲方此種態度，皆表驚訝，蓋菲律賓是否將被邀出席對日和會，迄今尙雖獲悉也。</p>
<p>（按：台灣歸還我國，已爲四强所同意，且已成旣定事實，菲方突提此議，殊屬令人費解。至琉球之應歸遠我國，亦爲歷史上，地理上，文化上必然之結諭。菲方此種意見，可謂對於事實，未有透澈之認識。）</p>
<h3>東京美國官員　謂應由美籍官</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京三日電〕此問美軍高級長官今日答復記者詢問對於中國與菲律賓要求接管琉球之意見，據稱：琉球在太平洋防務中現占主要地位，「應由美國繼續管理，」深信美國業已「喪失」朝鮮，蘇聯勢力在亞洲大陸擴張殆難避免，琉球之重要性因此增加，必須作爲空軍前進基地，藉以保陣美國在太平洋地位，並與關島及阿留申羣島基地聯合，制止自大陸向太平洋方面之任何攻勢。至於在日本保持大此軍隊將無用處。</p>
<h3>英訪華團抵廣州　孫科邵力子有函分致英兩院議長</h3>

<h3>周以德氏談話</h3>
<p>〔上接一版〕渠信國會必可贊成一全面性且對各國一致之對外政策，不吝援助，蓋援助他國即援助美國也。周氏認爲美國國會不致贊成對外援助之監督政策，然可能同意以顧問及觀察者之方式明隙援助之實施，並保證援助之利益完全及於被援國家之人民。渠於有關馬歇爾與魏德邁對華觀點之分歧與若干人所主張中國應於改革後方得援助，以及現政府之革新等問題拒絕評論。渠僅指稱，不論如何，美國現行對華政策乃爲不成功者。關於民盟被政府宣佈爲不合法一事，渠初稱身爲外人，對此中國內部之事，不宜提出意見，旋略一沈吟謂：「予所可言者，即政府應就此事提出證據，經過法律程序，使之明確並予公布，以免資助反政府之宣傳」。其後，周氏說明渠對中共看法，叙述共自六月來周遊世界各地，親見東歐各國在蘇維埃制度下無民主自由可言，中共從未宣稱放棄其蘇維埃化中國之企圖，其破壊交通及經濟之行徑，均使人民直接受害。渠反對蘇維埃式之無產階級獨裁，故亦反對中共。周氏並指陳國民政府對民主具有信心，謂民國二十年至廿六年一段安定時期間，已充分表現其實行民主政治之決心，且有相當成績，三民主義對中國及世界均可望有裨益。周氏最後盛着蔣主席：「無論若干中外人士如何惡意抨擎，蔣介石乃絕對忠於中國者」。渠相信遠東之安定與和平有賴於蔣主席領導下之强大中國之努力。</p>

<p>社論英國保守黨的再抬頭</p>
<p>繼着法國的市區選舉以後，英國全國的市區選舉，又於日前舉行。據報傳消息，此次英國的市選舉，在三九二市區中所已得知選舉結果的三八五市區中，保守黨獲得了六三一席，而工黨卻失去了六八三席。此雖非英國全國市選的最後結果，但據已得的消息，不難窺見在此次英國市選中，保守黨已獲得了決定性的勝利，重又抬起頭來。此次英國的選舉，雖係市區選舉，然亦足以見英國人民已多轉向到保守黨一方面，這與此後英國政治的推移，不得不說是一個重要的關鍵，應該値得我們密切的注意。</p>
<p>據工黨秘書長菲列浦談稱：「此次選舉的結果，雖然失望，但僅爲暫時的頓挫」；而保守黨的首領邱吉爾卻以爲迄是全國人民憎惡工黨政府的表現，工黨政府已不再爲人民所擁戴：因此有耍求全國普選來決定工黨政府壽命的主張。這些都是基於所屬政黨的利益而發的言論。我們站在客觀的地位，對於此次英國市選的結果，可以看到若干應該値得我們注意的幾點：</p>
<p>第一，工黨的失敗，卽在向來視爲工黨勢力的重耍據點的伯明罕，曼卻斯股等工業地區亦不能倖免；第二，在三十一個爲工黨所掌握的城市，如今也已失敗，由保守黨取而代之；第三，此次英國的市選，投票人數，極爲踴躍，據稱達選民總數的百分之八十；第四，這次英國市選所打的旗號，不是地方性的，而是全國性的，就是向艾德里政府的挑戰；而其結果，卻是工黨政府的慘敗。卽此四點，可見英國人民已向右轉，轉而傾向於保守黨。這正如法國市選的結果一樣，人民愈益向右。對於這一趨勢，我們認爲可以有如下的解釋：　這是對共產國祭復活，冀圖席捲整個歐洲的最顯明直接的答復。法國人民在其市選中已經明白表示了他們的意向與共產國際不相容；加以此次英國市選的結果，更表明了西歐民主國家人民意向的一致：　這是英國人民厭倦了工黨政府的表示。在戰事勝利後的兩年中，在工黨的執政下，英國人民的生活不僅比戰時更爲艱苦：且由於工黨政府的强調國有政策，計劃經濟，使英國人民對於他們的民族前途，不免戚到應憂；　工黨所採取的雖僅是溫和的社會主義，在對外政策上雖又與保守黨無甚顯殊的差異，但在對美關係上，已不再有像保守黨執政時那樣的融洽：面英國缺乏美元，又在在須與美國有更緊密的關係。有此幾點，英國人民乃轉而傾向保守黨，這似乎也並不是一件意外的事。</p>
<p>此次英國市選，執政的工黨雖遭遇了慘敗，但似乎未必卽時會使工黨政府動搖乃至傾覆。不過由於此次市選的失敗，却使工黨政府愈益增加其困難，在英國的國會中，工黨雖還操着絕對多數；但就是在此次市選結果尙未揭曉之前，在汽油配給的辯論中，保守黨在其首領邱吉爾的獅子吼之下，投票的結果，艾德里政府僅以二十四票的多數，保持了地位，可知工黨政府在國會中所處的地位已日益艱難。由於此次市選的結果，艾德里政府之將在國會中遭遇史嚴重的雞關”自在意中</p>
<p>但我們在此地要指出的是：英國的工黨和保守黨在本質上實在沒有　殊的差別。工黨雖以溫和的社會主義爲號召，但保守黨亦主張計都經濟：保守黨並不守舊，工黨也不革命。祇是工黨目稱溫和就會主義者，保守黨的社會經濟政策較工黨的更溫和一點而已。在對外政策方面，也沒有什麼分別：在工黨政府下，我們至今也沒有看到香港的歸還。所以工黨和保守黨在實質上似乎並無殊異。不過由於此次英國市選的結果，却更可以看見英國人民的向右轉，就連溫和的社會主義也失敗了：繼法國市選以後，這無疑地是西歐人民意向一致的具體表現，對共產國際的最好答復</p>
<p>戰爭製造着悲歡離合！華僑們的故事（上）波蘭行第九信。本報特派員毛樹淸</p>
<p>是一個伸夏的淸晨，維斯瓦河上刮着陣陣凉風，我從郵局寄信回拔邸途中，在河畔碰到三位「黃臉孔」的中國僑商，就從那一天起，旅居波蘭的華僑們，接二連三地到「布列斯時」飯店來看我，我也因此聽到了不少波蘭華僑們的故事。　如果不把已經有了中國國籍的婦女眷屬計算在內，現在全波蘭國境以內，祗有四十七名華僑了。據說去年人數比今年多，前年又比去年多，戰爭結束了，僑胞們都思家心切，紛紛離去，但也有跑到了法國，因爲川資用盡，船票太貴，而重復折回到波蘭來的。</p>
<p>和歐洲大陸其它國家一樣，華僑大多數是浙江靑田人，陳辭修將車的老鄕。靑田人和歡洲「有緣」，跑遍全歐洲，到處都可以看到那些淳樸節儉，辛勸耐勞的靑田老鄉。一九四五年，在巴黎里昂車站一帶，我問他們聽到過「陳誠將軍」的名字沒有？許多人茫然搖頭，但是這回到華沙，他們都翹起大姆指，開口閉口講陳誠，有好幾位堅認在小學讀書的時候，是陳將軍的同級同學。</p>
<p>我不知道他們說的是眞是假，反正，這些人從靑田萬里迢迢跑來波關，都有他們非凡的「一套」。廣東人飄洋到美國，是「一肩行李」，　田仁飄洋到歐洲，是「一肩石子」（靑田寳石），他們從東三省跋涉西伯利亞到歐洲來，語言不通，習俗不懂，那種盤古氏開天闢地的膽量，無法令人假想。一位華沙的皮革商僑胞詹志遠告訴我：他們一個家族，世世代代都有人住在歐洲，他父親到老年才回國，賺了好幾千美金，在家鄕造屋置產，然後他初中畢了業，又承繼父業，飄洋到波蘭來。另一位工廠老　卓進　，一生就在飄怕中過生活，他從靑田流浪到日本，會講日本話，也到過「滿洲里」（意即指東北），在那裏學會了講「官話」　，後來溜進了西伯利亞，在莫斯科躭了很多年，所以又學會了講俄國話，卓進蘭現在的玻蘭話講得相當好，但是他說他祗會聽和　，不會寫，報紙也馬馬虎虎可以看，因爲拚音文字，只要順　者念下去，就可以念出意思來。　他說：很多現在居住在波蘭的華僑，　是從莫斯科來的。「俄羅斯自從共產黨革命以後，華僑們便沒有了生路，因此，紛紛逃亡到波蘭來」。但是，他非常感傷地說：「波蘭現在又成了共產黨的世界」？另一位長臉的華僑在旁邊插嘴說：「中國現在也居然有人做共產黨，那眞是愚笨到萬分」，他說：「讓他們到這兒來瀚看罷，共產黨的强盜世界！」　事後，我才明白華僑們怨言的由來，波蘭政府的警察，據說很多次搜捕華僑住宅，有沒有漏稅的「私貨」？有沒有其他違犯規章的物件？因此，華僑們都提心吊膽，深怕他們積年累月的血汗金錢，會禍起蕭牆，全部落空。我問他們莫斯科是不是這樣？有位僑胞吿訴我：莫斯科共產革命成功以後，差不多的正當僑商，都撤離了俄羅斯，祗有和共產黨有關係的人例外，他們至今仍住在莫斯科。一九三九年，納粹佔領波籣以後的幾年，是華僑們暗無天日的日子，他們被抓在集中營做工，一天工作到十小時以上，據說，德國軍官們相當歡喜「華工」，因爲華工「聽話」，而且從不怠惰，前年年初，德國從波蘭潰敗下來，納粹的軍官們吿訴他們：「跟咱們軍隊一塊兒退到柏林去，否則，俄羅斯打進來，都得把你們槍斃！」許多人就這樣流浪到了德國，也有不少人在納粹潰退的時候開了「小差」，現在仍留居在波蘭。　一九四四年八月，是華沙最悲慘的季節。那一年七月，俄羅斯軍隊席捲盧布林，大軍逼華沙城下，流亡在倫敦的彼蘭政府，沒有取得莫斯科成立的波蘭政府的同意，於八月一日在首都起義，原來的意思，是要配合城外的俄軍，光復波蘭，但不料俄軍按兵不動，因之造成了納粹在華沙的大燒殺。波籣人稱一次起義，呌做「AK黨革命」，AK黨革命毀滅了華沙所有的建築，毀滅了波蘭幾十萬生命，也牽累了我們無辜的僑胞。　有兩個靑田商人，尹彩池和徐顯貴，一九二九年離開中國，「行行復行行」，於一九三二年到達波籣，在波籣經商，小有積蓄？原來打算一九三九年冬天回國，想不到那一年正是第二次歐戰　發，波蘭首先遭殃，就這樣繫在集中營內，挨了好幾年。</p>
<p>AK黨革命爆發之前，尹徐兩人，還有尹彩池的叔父尹作漁，遷居在葉沙城內的社戶咖路五十九號，革命爆發前一小時，尹作漁出外購物，槍聲一響，城內街　交通斷絕，尹作漁回不得自己的家，「就在這一段期間之內，憑空發生了命案。』</p>

<p>〔路透社新德里三日電〕喀什米爾及珍那迦兩邦之內戰，似有波及印度最大　邦海特拉巴之勢。海特拉巴王雖已於八月十五日印度宣布獨立之日，聲明該邦之不擬參加印度或巴基斯坦，然此一資源最富人口量多面積最廣之土邦內部之動亂，已在醞釀之中。四天來回教徒不時滋事，深恐海特拉巴王之宣布併入印度自治領。海特拉巴之動亂，苟無法予以遏止，則必致引起印度各藩邦之爆炸局勢，而使整個印度半島陷於恐怖之中。海特拉巴與印度自治領之談判，今日繼續在新德里舉行，會後未有公報發表。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里三日電〕印度半島西海岸喀　瓦半島上之珍那迦邦，自該邦回王宣布該邦之併入巴基斯坦後，該邦印度敎徒已宣在成立臨時政府，並組織革命軍，向首都進發。據珍那迦邊界之拉保古來電稱，革命軍業已佔領距首都僅十入哩之狄拉　馬城及週團村落二十五座即將進迫首都。</p>

<p>尼赫魯繼日，吾人在過去對於任何所爲之劣蹟，不論其係回印或錫克，均一致加以譴責，故若印度敎徒，錫克族或喀什米爾之官員，有在該邦珍漢省行爲失檢者，均當予以譴責。但吾人所獲報告，詳示該省村莊九十五座已爲自巴基斯坦之侵入者所毀，城鎭之被刦遭毀者已屬不少。喀什米爾波奈區之大部份，已爲侵入者所佔，此豈非表示西北邊省及西奉哲布正發動對喀什米爾有組織的侵略行爲。侵入之部隊武器精良，領導有方，均係來自巴基斯坦者，吾人有權質問巴基斯坦，何以此等人得自巴基斯坦侵入，以及彼等如何能運此種武器，此豈非達背國際公法之行爲，或對於鄰邦之不友好行爲。</p>

<h3>美籍專家康威博士繕就改善交通報吿　建議開闢道路减少車輛密度增添公共汽車加强運輸力量</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市府爲改善中區交通，前聘美籍專家康威博士一行三人，於本年三月　來滬，實地考察，二個月後，　返美國費城，繕就改進報告，已於日前由公用局所派隨同出國之胡處長匯泉　帶返國，呈送本市市政當局。昨據公用局趙局長語記者稱：報告中有極具體之建議，甚屬珍貴，然或亦有不合本市環境者，將加以修正。公用局將會同警察局，工務局等有關機關分組研究及分期實施之。報告全文，長達八十頁，其要點如左：</p>
<h3>公共車輛數量不足</h3>
<p>關於目前交通工具擁擠之分析，按照本市英商及法商兩公司之營運情形，如以民國三十五年及廿五年互作比較，則三十五年份全年載客人數，較二十五年超出百分之四十至一百六十，而全年行車公里，則减少約百分之三十，擁擠情形，自不能免。市辦公共汽車，雖見努力發展，但限於車輛設備，且戰前英商公共汽車公司，華商閘北公共汽車公司，及南市電車公司之車輛，均巳不復存在，三單位之總和，戰後較戰前載客人數，增加百分之三十四，而行駛之車輛數，則减少百分之十八，同時營業三輪車人力車等，則自民國二十五年之一萬零八百十八輛，增加至三萬一千二百五十二輛，增加數爲百分之一八九。公共車輛數量之不足，促使其他車輛之增加，實爲擁　之主要原因之一。</p>
<h3>値得注意之自由道</h3>
<p>近世專家，均認爲使用優秀性能之車輛，加强交通管制，增加行車速度，以求達到增加運輸量之目的，爲增加運輸量之最經濟辦法。地下通之建設，雖爲解決交通之另一優良辦法，但其價値極爲高昂，（最近費城市政展覽估計地下道每英里價値一千六萬萬美元），高架道之價値雖較低，但對於城市之發展具有不良之影響，紐約市府將第六街之高架道購買拆卸，可爲明證。最應注意者，即本市交通如能積極改進，尚無需用地下道或高架車之必要，中區最繁忙道路如南京路外白渡橋，四川路橋，中正東路等，其最大單向需要運輸量，經實測爲每小時五千人至八千人。但公共汽車及有軌電車，如有優秀車輛，而交通管制得當時，每小時單向運輸量，均就達到九千人至一萬二千人以上。近世城市交通，另一重要發展，爲自由道（Free　Way），其構造性質，彷彿城市各區域間之公路，可以快速行車，無需經過中區之　忙區域，此項可能發展，上海最可値得注意。</p>
<h3>改進計劃分兩大部</h3>
<p>關於改進計劃，包括兩大部份：（甲）市政部份：　提高交通警素質及待遇，　嚴格執行交通管制規章，　向公衆宜傳交通安全辦法，　改善交通號誌，　快慢車輛，應分路行駛，即在使用同路時，亦應劃分車道，　瓶頸式房屋之分期淘汰，　其他遠期計劃：開闢道路，經過前跑馬　地位，迎接福州路與威海術路，閘北開　大路，述接楊樹浦及虻口區，自長壽路　其附近，超越蘇州河以後，北區車輛可純由此路，直達滬西及西南區，减少中區車輛密度。（乙）公共交通部份：　增添車輛，第一期計劃，　設法增加新式或公共汽車三百輛，第二期再改進有軌及無軌電車。</p>
<p>康威博士於其報告書中，特別指出近世都市於發展過程中，商業中心區交通，必然需要妥善處理，其未及時設法者，則經騐所示之必然趨勢，爲交通擁塞，往來不便，商業外移，中區商業　退，地產貶値，稅收减少，本市現正面臨此一階段，亟宜通力合作，及早解決云。</p>
<p>掀髯微笑·報以掌聲</p>

<h3>沉寃洗清　夢境成眞　福州滅屍案　兇手成擒記</h3>
<p>〔本報福州一日航訊〕此間道山路短三營二號，近日發生一駭人聽聞之謀財害命滅屍沉跡巨案，轟動福州全市，一時往觀者人山人海。茲探全情如下：仙遊縣人鄭淸靜，年卅二歲，畢業於福建學院高中部，現任仙遊縣坂頭鎭商會會長，平日經商於閩臺之間，今看春與其契友某，在台北合營東南行一所，由鄭任經理　，營業情况尚不惡，鄭家中有老母及胞兄一人，娶妻林瑞英，育有子女五人，其妻向隨鄭本人在台居住。</p>
<p>本年九月間，妻因懷孕，臨盆期近，光行返</p>
<p>仙　家鄉</p>
<p>鄭則表示九月底亦將返閩一行。其妻返仙將及一月，於九月卅日接其夫自台來電云：於十月一日由台乘機返榕，在榕勾留三天，即行轉仙。鄭果於是日抵榕，先闢寓於江濱路江濱旅社，翌晨進城，到道山路短三營二號訪其諗友吳超。張良棟，蓋吳前在台，曾欠鄭款一筆，鄭此來半爲索款，於談吐中爲吳張二人獲悉鄭此回</p>
<p>携有現鈔</p>
<p>及支票三千餘萬元，引起吳張二人之殺心，吳假懷善意，虛與週旋，一面二人設計毒害鄭之性命。十月三日晚，即鄭返榕之第三日，吳張邀鄭到家飲酒言歡，乘鄭不意間將其勒斃，沉屍於房內地板下，事隔兩日，兇手向該屋房東詭稱：回鄉省親一行，於午夜間携帶行李物件遠遁，房東初尚不知何故也。而鄭妻良於十月一日接伊夫即日返閩常後，終日倚門迎待。</p>
<p>望穿秋水</p>
<p>不見伊人，據伊自稱：曾於上月廿六日晚突作一不祥之夢，夢見伊夫立其床前，詳告被害經過，並囑其尅日來榕，到該處開挖取屍，並代伸寃云云。死者之妻，翌晨即程程來榕，　向死者處房東及鄭生前好友林元勝威查詢一切，後打開兇手所住空房，據稱：此時頓覺神志昏迷，忽見有人指示舊地板之下，釘有新鐵釘，於是狂呼</p>
<p>打開地板</p>
<p>斯時適有警員經過是處，聞房內有人狂呌聲，即趨入相視，見有十餘人聚團，詢知詳情，一面報告分局，一面僱工發掘，挖士四尺許，果發現赫然屍首一具，即鄭淸靜本人也。經警局通知地檢處派法醫前往騐屍，省府當局以案情重大，已飭屬將兇手吳超及張良棟二人於一日在仙遊縣境緝獲，刻正準備送省究辦。按此案經過情形，宛如一部唐宋時代傳奇，其中尤以鄭妻「夢境成眞」一節，離奇怪誕異常，姑誌之如上。（特派記者陳正予）</p>

<h3>豫省競種菸業菸田大扳俏價</h3>
<p>「本報鄭州卅一日航訊」河南許昌襄縣郟縣一帶出產菸葉是最有名的，近來大小縣份，幾乎沒有不種菸葉的，農林部在許昌等地設了試驗塲，同時發美國種子，獎勵農民培種，眼前一畝菸田，出它二千萬元還不肯賣。聽說一畝菸田出產的收入，就有一二千萬元，因爲大家競種菸葉的結果，帶來了河南糧食日貴的結果，（當然還有其他原因，）農民現在對於種菸起了喃喃之語，認爲選樣下去，稱菸的人雖然眼前發了財，大吃特吃，但最後如果全省沒有統籌糧食的辦法，那菸葉也許會成　粟葉，大家起來要剷平它。農民當然也知道這些菸葉，是可以塞住一部份外匯的外流，但他們還覺得他們自己吃飯要緊。</p>
<p>「又訊」這裏市上近來有新鮮棗子出現，大小如靑果，色澤如咖啡，入口卽脆又甜，且甚能飽腹。這棗子的產地是在鄭州南昌的新鄭。新鄭十個鄕，就有五個鄕全種棗子，年產六千萬斤。現在每斤只賣三各元。繼著鮮棗前後上市的，在這裏有柿子。小的每千元可買十餘只，大約也可買到七八只，汜水和鞏縣出產的柿餅，尤爲著名，廣東商人向鄭州定購柿餅的，還是不少，如果交通方便的話，這個農民副業的收獲，馬上可以恢復的。</p>
<h3>香港兩私娼被逐出境十年</h3>
<p>〔本報香港一日訊〕香港最高當局十月卅一日正式批准遞解兩個「阻街女郎」出境十年。驅逐賣淫的娼女出境，不特爲香港有史以來所僅見，恐怕也爲世界各大都市所少有。這兩個不幸的女人：一名譚女，一名李鄕，均自認爲有夫之婦，在工廠當女工，前者之夫裝電燈泡，後者係縫帆布膠鞋者之要，但因工資收入不足維持生活，始在街頭賣俏，因是被捕，前後已有五六次，警方便以「無業游民」罪，呈請港府把她們遞解出境。</p>
<h3>蘇省地價稅以一千萬爲起點</h3>

<h3>丹徒鎭繁榮有望</h3>
<p>「本報鎭江一日訊」麪粉大王榮德生等，現正在本邑的丹徒鎭作大量的投資，創設新申第九紗廠和大規模的水電廠，因此許多官商們都在動腦盤謀　榮工商業的準備。據建設廳可靠消息：復興整個大鎭江的計劃，僅是時間問題，該廳亦以丹徒鎭密邇市區，瀕臨大江，交通便利，業已派員前往該鎭測量水深，將來新申九廠和大規模的發電廠　立了以後，鎭江一切的繁榮遠景，將因着這個動力的開始而改觀進步。</p>
<h3>「輸入特許證」問題港穗兩地甚囂塵上</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州一日訊〕廣九路及東江一帶，「遠征隊」，「飛車團」，「渡河隊」，「小鬼隊」，「海鷹派」，「飛機仔」之類的「走險英雄」，時有出現，稅關當局半個月內緝獲二十億元以上的私貨，達十四宗之多，海關的收入一跌二十倍，日入不過二三千萬，國家財政蒙受着空前的損失。</p>
<p>繼九友拳「通天證」之後，港穗間市塲曾一度轟傳又有所調「輸人特許證」的問題發生，這問題關係着廣州進出口商業的生命，華南的市塲，以至於輸管會華南分會的工作問題。然而輪管會華南分會方面，則嚴詞表示從未有「特許證」的發生，並立即派員到香港去調査。其間輸管會的高級負責人（副主委田定庵），亦表示所謂「特許證」，輸管分會絕對不會發出。他們表示這消息只有兩個可能：一個是「舞弊」，另一個是「謠言」，可是各地的報紙卻歷歷如繪的說出「特許證」的形狀，顏色，大小。究竟是否「確有其證」，抑或是「最大的　聯在於九龍關」，只有如田定庵氏所說：「紙不能包住火」，期待着水落石出而已。</p>
<p>日前華南輸管分會，爲了獎勵輸出事業，曾經設立出口物資財產小組委曾和出口物資審價委會，以解決出口商人　資金困難興　助出口商的結匯價，可是，由於華南走私的「展開」，而外匯　價與　市則有若　兎競賽，（十日內官價與黑市差達百分之卅，）又有幾個出口商能夠領一點補助而去吃百分之卅的苦頭？（記者梁小中）</p>

<h3>睢寗攻防戰　陳毅慘敗經過</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州十月二十八日訊〕睢寗位於徐（州）淮（陰）公路綫的中點，它是蘇北的門戶，因此，它在戰略上便居有舉足輕重的重要性，這座小城，週圍不到兩華里，在去年經匪軍手裏奪回後，直到今天，還沒有恢復它原來繁榮。</p>
<p>十月十二日上午九時，整二十五師師長孫良誠將軍，在睢寗參議會的席上發表了一段談話：「匪陳毅率其所部第三縱隊之七·八·九三個師，共有九個步兵團，一個騎兵團，約一萬五千餘人，已於十日夜在西寺坡越津浦路東竄，連日攻陷靈　·泗縣·企岡回竄蘇北，陳匪要重禍蘇北，便非進攻睢寗不可」。又說：「只要大家同心同德的堅守，三天以後，我保證援軍可以趕來」。孫師長當日下午便赴宿遷坐鎭。睢寗軍政當局，在下午召開了一次</p>
<p>緊急會議</p>
<p>決定堅守城池，並立誓「不成功便成仁」，當時城內的守軍僅有二十五師輜重營的兩個連，睢寗保安團四個連，三挺重機槍，兩門迫擊砲，是他們最高貴的重武器。要守城，便須先出擊，這是先發制人，爭取主動的戰法。保安團副王雲文十二日晚率兩個連到城西南的睢河沿岸佈防，十三日上午便在大李集附近與匪發生前哨戰，下午匪軍增援，愈戰愈烈，匪曾被迫後退，後來，匪改變方式，不攻正面，由兩冀派便衣隊繞道側擊，王雲文團副以衆寡懸殊，撤守荊門（睢寗西南二十五里）據點，堅守荊山的</p>
<p>四座碉堡</p>
<p>匪用重砲轟擊，已打塌了三座調堡，王團副堅不突圍，及到這座碉堡被轟倒，玉團副終於壯烈犧牲，兩連官兵傷亡三分之二，乃冒死突團回城</p>
<p>十三日下午，陳匪佈置攻城戰，匪以六個團的兵力攻城，四個團的兵力警戒，城外十華里都劃入警戒綫內，一面防備守軍突圍，一面預備迎擊國軍的馳援部隊。這樣，更堅定了守軍「置之死地而後生」的信念。十三日夜，匪軍猛攻睢寗南關，激戰澈夜，匪未得逞。十四日上午，匪傾全力攻城，並以排砲猛轟南關大街守軍，保安團第二中隊傷亡過半，一區區長劉敬先，南關鎭長胡華民，區隊副葛文華，中隊長張玉淸，相繼殉難。南關大街遂棄而不守。入夜，匪集中火力猛撲東門，以大刀砍城門外之鐵絲綱，拿平射砲轟擊城門樓，樓　，匪二十餘人蜂擁入城</p>
<p>展開巷戰</p>
<p>防禦工事之麻袋土包及鹿柴障礙物均被機槍射得粉碎，李副營長率預備除趕往，始將匪全部殲滅，一夜之間，東門匪曾三次衝入，均被殲滅或擊退。</p>
<p>守軍由二十五師輜重營宋祥甫營長統一指揮，宋營長坐鎭城中心的大碉堡上，沉着堅毅，入夜用信號槍指揮，那裏吃緊，他便親自　隊到那裏去撕殺，他曾嚴令守軍各守崗位，匪衝入城內，用機槍掃射，刺刀亂穿，不准喊「殺！殺」之聲，因爲如在夜間喊「殺」，鄰近守軍便知道匪軍衝進城內，就會動搖，所以十四日夜，東門的三次肉搏戰，鄰近守軍直到天亮才知道。每天晚上，除聽到重砲，機槍，步槍聲，和看到天上子彈的火花外，城內寂靜得和死去一樣。</p>
<p>匪軍衝鋒</p>
<p>是一個連作單位，這運死光，再上來一連，再死淨了，再上來一連，這種輸番的疲勞攻擊，確實厲害。匪軍夜間作戰是用機槍指揮，這是俄式機槍，槍的聲音特別嚮亮，用連發和點發來指揮攻擊或退却</p>
<p>十五日，匪轉攻西門，至午夜匪由西門突入一個連，宋營長親自參加白刃戰，一氣斬殺匪軍十人，他自己就奪獲七支步槍，後來匪又攻入四次，悉被殲滅，因爲匪攻入城內，事先已經過</p>
<p>幾次撕殺</p>
<p>，疲勞不堪了，守軍以逸待勞，自然佔優勢。十六日中午，國軍五十一師及孫良誠部均趕抵救援，睢寗之闡遂解，陳匪重禍蘇北的迷夢，到此乃完全粉碎。</p>
<p>淮海綏靖區司令官張雪中，十七日午，由淮陰抵雅寗視察，並向守軍致慰問之忱，孫良誠師長同行，當將守城有功軍民，分別嘉勉，宋祥甫營長</p>
<p>功勳最大</p>
<p>，當允　升兩級，（由巾校升爲少將，）蔣主席並電宋營長全體官兵嘉勉，且分別犒賞記功。</p>
<p>慘敗後的陳匪，在他自己檢討會上說：自脫離沂蒙山區，三縱隊打下過二十八個縣城，都沒有支特過三小時的攻擊，這次打了三畫夜，傷亡及逃散，共計損失十五個連，死了九個進長，營團長還不在內。</p>
<p>的確，匪死傷達一千五百餘，乘機逃散的也有一千以上，現在睢寗城外，每日携械投誠的散匪很多，匪說：「吃不飽，現在還穿着破爛的單衣，天天奔跑，逼着當砲灰，跟著陳毅早天晚天是個死，投誠實在是一條唯一的活路。」（特派記者縱春林）</p>

<p>華聯在港戰和星島二比一</p>
<p>「合衆社香港三日電」上海華聯足球隊今日在港最後一戰，二比二和星島征英隊。星島以二比〇佔先，滬隊下牛時連中二球造成平手，全局沉悶，各中十二碼球一次。</p>
<p>滬華賽隊張邦綸嚴士鑫張林根韓龍波孟義良高保正瞿永福李義臣　龍海顧以撤費春華</p>
<p>港軍聯隊加拉斯亟（砲兵）修打（空軍）格林尼（海軍）卡拉乞（砲兵）巴拿（迪　）沙拔（砲兵）亨打（燕兵）其亞能（燕兵）米曹（燕兵）干那士（迪　）贊臣（巴符）</p>
<p>上半時連中二球</p>
<p>開賽後，軍聯自撥球進攻發，滬隊即奪得優勢，永福頂高，義臣射斜，混攻達十四分鐘，春華右邊突進，一脚傳出，「懶牛」接着怒射，球急如矢，首告入網。滬華卽得勝利，繼續進但，十六分鐘後，義臣迎頂來球，球向門橫過，龍海衝前脚一撥而入，滬華以二換防後，軍聯急圖反攻，雖能深入敵區，奈射門乏術，雙方多在中塲爭奪，問有射門，也是一脚了事，精采的，只有龍海一記單刀，他已將球挑過門將，可惜中社，永福奔前再射，卻給巴拿救出。混戰下去，滬隊有邦綸在，軍聯無法破蛋，比賽完結，始終　是滬華聯凈勝兩球。</p>
<p>華聯隊前鋒活躍</p>
<p>滬華聯雖然缺了兩員大將，但前　鋒多了龍海和以撤，　搶首衝，鋒錢活　得多，永福　翼，速度雖談不到，但一傳一射，併相　淸腕。義臣演來已非「懶牛」，滬隊的勝，靠他一射而外，還惡他的爭奪中塲球。</p>
<p>由於軍聯的鋒綫弱，滬華後防便穩定，因此中衛可以全力爭奪中塲球，於是形勢便在滬華手上握定了。軍聯的前鋒太不行，特別是右翼，前鋒沒有好的攻勢，守也無法固守，結果是得了一雙鴨蛋。</p>

<h3>國行積極澈查退票　派員赴交換所實地抽查　分析原因研討取締辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：財政金融當局對取締退票，刻正積極進行。前日（一日）國行會與財部　同派員往票據交換所實她抽査，當日退票共三千九百二十七張，金額四三二九億三千八百零四萬三千二百七十七元六角五分。當擇其中數額較鉅者三六九張，加以分析，計其退票原因，由於　發票託收款項尚朱收到佔百分之三八點五，　投支過額百分之二三點三，　接洽可付，請與發票入接洽再來收佔百分之一五點二，　存款不足佔百分之一〇點九，　已經止付佔百分之二點五，　票非即期佔百分之二點五，　印章不全或不淸佔百分之二點二，　暫停透支百分之一點六，　此戶已結淸佔百分之〇點八，　未經受款人背書估百分之另點五，　　背書不淸或不符，佔百分之〇點五。　　字跡模糊，佔百分之〇點五，　　更改處未經發票人蓋章證明佔百分之〇點五，　　　計理由佔百分之〇點五。當局將根據以上統計，分別研討取締辦法云。</p>
<p>又訊，當局加緊澈査行莊退票聲中，市塲銀根趨緊。昨日票據交換共計一一八七五張，總金額二，三五五，五七三，三〇四，〇〇〇元。四行二局差進三〇五億元，暗息一角〇八分至二角二分半，退票數字昨尚未統計完竣，逆料爲數仍甚可觀。故澈查工作，財部與國行人員仍在繼續進行中。據國行稽核處副處長稱，陽歷年　在即，若不嚴加管制，年關前必有大波動。經如此澈査後，退票可逐少减少；退票减少，貨物之成交數次亦可减少，物價亦可　此穩定。此外對票據之信用亦可整頓健全云。</p>
<p>又四聯總處對此事亦極爲注意，認爲退票增多，足以影響金融及物價，已特派稽核來滬，督導澈査工作。</p>
<h3>政府將另訂新辦法　吸收海外華僑匯款　據中國銀行統計目前僑匯　已恢復外匯未改以前狀態</h3>
<p>外匯此次由釘住不變而改爲機動調整，具有鼓勵出口，及吸收僑匯之兩大目的。但自外匯新辦法公布後，黑市與市價距離甚遠。出口物資，尚可勉强輸出，而僑匯仍相繼逃避。據中團銀行之統計，外匯辦法改訂之初，僑匯確有增加，嗣即逐漸减少，現幾又恢復外匯未改訂辦法前之狀態。各方對改善僑匯，曾有不少意見，如僑匯可開立外幣存單，如准計僑胞運回需用物賢，甚有主張提高外匯市價者。政府準衡國內外情形，及利害之輕輕重，始終未能採納。上次物價波動，有賣難於外匯之掛高，目前漲風已戢，若將外匯市價接近黑市，不免又刺激物價。其他辦法，亦有困難之處。但僑匯爲外匯頭寸重要之來源，其關係國際收支之平衡至鉅，政府決不致長此犧牲此筆鉅額外匯。據有關方面消息：在目前之情况下，僑匯問題，唯有另訂匯率。所訂之僑匯匯率，與黑市相等，庶幾僑匯可以源源湧來。如與黑市有差額，僑匯仍難達預期之目的。民信局固有其歷史與信仰，但一般僑胞，仍相信國家銀行之保陣。去年外匯開放時期，南洋一帶民信局，即紛紛向中國銀行要求恢復往來，將其所吸收之僑匯，交中國銀行轉匯，可見僑匯問題，全爲匯率關係，民信局非僑匯之障碍。故政府對僑匯之處置，最近期內，可能採取另訂匯率辦法，以謀補救。一般認爲出口所得之外匯，必須以物資輸出始能換得，而僑匯責無須物資即可獲取，僑匯之重於出口物資，實有其特殊之因素。據某金融權成表示，如政府實行此一計劃，預計劃每收入一億五千萬美元之僑匯，決無問題。</p>
<h3>自費留學結匯辦法　日內通函指定銀行</h3>
<p>據國行發表消息稱：該行於十月廿九日奉到行政院制定之公自費留學生結購外匯規則後，該行非進口貨外匯審核委員會，即行研究，對於上項規則內自費留學生結匯部份執行技術上有關問題，擬於一二日內，分發通函，通知各指定銀行運照執行云。</p>
<h3>行局打包放款計息　四聯核定三項辦法</h3>
<p>四聯總處前爲協助出口物資外銷，會訂有打包放款原則三項，規定凡出口商運銷物資出口，其打包整理期間，得以國外爲用證及出口貨物，向國家銀行抵押借款，期間以三個月爲限。施行以來，頗著成效。惟利率一項，向係比照普通放款計算。茲爲配合外匯政策，並鼓勵出口商加速外銷起見，各行局做敘做打包放款，除仍照上項原則辦理外，所有計息方式，復經核定辦法三項：　限期在十天以內者，月息五分。　期限超過十天至二十天以內者，月息六分半。　期限超過二十天至三十天以內者，月息八分。</p>
<h3>食米初堅後疲</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市，共到米糧一萬六千石，店方進胃尚股，市塲交易熱鬧，粳米續升二萬元，秈米亦加萬餘工。早薄稻漲二萬餘元，白元陰元平平。午時以各物俱跌，人心轉軟。麵粉零化活絡，回漲三五千元，但收市亦頗懈淡。　皮鄕銷有動，暫挺之狀。豆餅客帮不動，略呈疲勢。</p>
<p>黃豆隴海來源接　，長江到貨不弱，浦東平湖杜黃米源湧旺，汕廠進胃不濃，本街交易平常，客帮納胃稀少，杜豆狂跌萬元，客豆亦挫三五千元。菉豆南北洋均有進辦，暗暗帶緊。赤豆廣帮續吸，依然牢立。蠶豆零化仍懈，萎靡不振，步削三五千元。</p>
<p>缸豆油頭納胃不爽，平平之格。紅糧肯島動辦，油頭收購，形勢活潑，挺升三五千元。苞米北洋揀高拾取，續漲萬元，中次平平。生仁容胃仍然沉悶，本街交易續動，暫呈堅定之勢。芝蔴油廠停辦，客銷停頓？本街看望，供過於求，苦無受主，挫落一二萬元，成交甚少。</p>
<p>油市一蹶不振，生油以江北到貨踵接，繼續猛瀉八九萬元。豆油相繼續跌八九萬元，菜蔴油及淸油均見步跌五六萬元，食油聯配處正在辦理配油之中，油市仍少樂觀。</p>
<h3>紡調會辦事處　津粵漢相繼成立</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：紡調會天津與廣州事處已於上月底分別成立，漢口辦事處於本月上句亦可成立。又悉：棉布議價紡調會於一二日即可議定。上月份紗布南運統計，計棉紗四千一百廿件。棉布九萬九千二百十七疋。專案辦理者棉紗二千九百九十六件，棉布四萬七千三百八十六疋。又第二期代紡外棉各廠尚未解繳者，紡調會已分別催詢，希於本月內絡續解繳淸楚。至於工繳方面尚在雙方商討中。</p>
<h3>油類原料定量輸出亟應注意市塲波動</h3>
<p>油類原料輸出，改按定量許可制後，輸出數額，根據國際糧食緊急處會議，核减爲三萬九千噸，再按比率運往各國，據油業權威稱，定量出口制度，使出口數量受限制，對市場無多達影響。但恐輸出細則公佈時，可能引起市塲之波動，因出口商羣向市塲爭購，或將影響市價，但油類原料之供應，並無問題，目前華北東北產量甚豐，倘交通　利，國內供應有餘。故定量輪出制實行後，政府　應注意出口商之羣向市塲爭聯，　開暢交通，使華北原料南流云。</p>
<h3>全經會審查聯配　紡聯推代表陳述意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕全國紡聯會頃接獲首都全無會電，同意紡聯會於本　三舉行之全經會棉紗聯合配銷審查會上推派代表二人，陳述意見。紡聯會獲電後，當即由杜理事長選派劉丕基，榮爾仁二人代表出席，該項審査意見將在過四之全經會上提出討論云。又悉民營廠配銷方案業經擬就，今明日即可發表。</p>
<p>又訊，據紗業中透露，目前雙方爭執之焦點，以「機動性議價」一點爲最重要，現廠方認爲此次生活指數提高後，廠方成本開支已加增，故將來議價必須機動性的增加。但官方則認爲議價如次次調整，則將被認爲有領導物價上漲之嫌，故處理亦頗不易。華股昨晨初稱穩，但不久即復類廢。業中大戶將存多斬售，以致每况愈下，逐步轉疲。塲內外雖有</p>
<p>浮多繼續　售華股頹勢難挽補空，低從微回，過程十分淒涼。</p>
<p>晨初以減低證金。及美食消息，均見助買而見昂，永紗自二九二元及二九五元開後，散多即供，略有下游。旋曾升至即交二九二元，遞交二九七元高價。經紛紛脫手，逐漸下游。場外息價仍站一角九分半及二角四，而降至二八二元及二八七元。正午在成交冷落，缺乏維持下，退至即交二七七元，遞交二八二元低價。午收微升爲二七九元及二八五元，除新亞成交有限，較上週五跌落較多，火柴新華華豐中絲所跌亦略多外，餘股尚屬平疲。結果較上週六，即交股計內衣恒　尚平，榮豐微升，永紗信和美亞新光勤興中法永泥閘北　安景綸大通華新微降，華豐火柴新華中絲跌半成，新亞降一成。遞交股計新光美亞跌半成，永紗信和華　景福勤興微挫。</p>
<p>後市上塲平穩，開後來紗退至二七八元及二八二元，有買而稍盤，國行交換差進，銀根見緊，臨收前退至二七七元及二八領元，新華百貨之實行增資，證交揭示公攤認聯，且屬最後半天交易，散戶失望（實係送三認四），引起大量了結，迫低至六十元內。永紗以二八〇元及二八三元之價結束。統益獨見平穏，惟水泥五和，缺少對手’獨告慘降。結果較晨收，計即交股景福閘北恒豐均平，永紗統益美亞中絲華豐火柴新光內衣微升，華新榮盟安勤興信誼微挫</p>
<h3>國家行局遷京政院規定步驟</h3>
<p>（本報訊）關於國家行局遷京事，聞行政院已規定四項步驟；　國家行局之理監事會議本月份必須在京召開。　國家行局行政管理部門之秘書處人事處限年底以前遷京，　國家行局會計部門之會計處稽核處限明年三月以前遷京。　國家行局總行局之業務部鬥，視業務情形之　急，分別限期遷京，據悉：央銀銀行各局處現有一部份遷京辦公，在京購建之行舍，即將竣事，預料常可如期遷移。至總行局遷京後上海部份業務，是否將成立分行一節，據聞國行尚無在滬設分行之議，惟業務局或可暫緩遷京云。仔，新與景綸巾紡跌半成，水泥跌一成。遞交股計永紗信和華總美亞微挫，景福新光平平，塲外各老股計文化股及銀行股再俏半成，餘尚平和。新華永公百貨辦理增資，即日前市起，暫停交易。增資完成，新股自今日起，先拍即交，週四起恢復遞交，成交單位暫定十萬股。</p>

<p>本年度生絲，中信局自收購以來，迄至目前爲止，共收三千九百九十七包，預計可收一萬三千担。原限各廠商本月底交齊，目前已有延緩趨勢，故中信局收購工作之結束，亦將展期。至已收購之生絲，已陸續外銷，現計銷二千三百六十五包，輪美一千二百包，輸印一千包，其餘則銷英法，尚餘一千六百三十二包，決運蘇易貨，其已收購者，業全部外</p>
<p>又訊：據四川絲業領袖范崇實氏稱：本年度川省生絲已照政府規定政策，於上月底由中信局收購，共計九〇〇担，價格每担三一七三萬元，手續亦已於三日辦理完　。范氏又稱，政府收　價格雖僅及市價之半數，然幸上半年度川省物價平穏，蠶農得此售價，不至虧本。但秋絲成本，尚超出春絲二三倍左右，其出產數量暫無估計，預算　及　綠之半數云。</p>
<h3>實銷呆滯銀行抽緊　棉紗布行情下游　藍鳳細紗比週六降百四十萬</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，初開平庸，旋以各方銀根轉緊，一般浮多彼迫吐售，更因紗業同行週六退票甚行情不支下游。故最後四二支藍　細紗，比週六回　一百四十萬，爲三千六百六十萬元。其餘各支粗細紗，價亦軋降自二十萬至四十萬元。</p>
<p>棉布市勢晨開時染廠及散戶搜吸，龍頭細布做價步高九十一萬元，嗣因常局抽抽嚴厲，更以市上退票之事日多，銀根步緊，而實銷不動，浮戶反出，行情遂告下挫。結果十二磅龍頭等各　細布，比週六回跌七八千至一萬五六千元，惟細斜漂布元布及高擋士林布，以消化尚佳，步昂自一萬五千至五萬元外，共他各布市均趨疲云。</p>
<p>現棉疲軟昨日現棉市况疲軟，同業因銀根緊急，反進爲出，紗廠因棉紗回跌，進意不濃，市上交易逢低有吸，做開尚旺，成交一五〇〇包。送廠價，做開沙市三六五萬八千，啓東三五五萬五千，漢細三四七萬，漢粗三〇六萬，仲通三〇六萬，成交六〇〇包。棧交價做開三七三萬七千，白洛去三七〇萬〇三千，漢細三二七萬，安東二八六萬，山東三六三萬七千，成交九〇〇包，周浦籽花六三萬七千。</p>

<h3>車夫</h3>
<p>— 許欽文</p>
<p>領到了幾斗平價米，我不便再步行回家。</p>
<p>「車子　」在校門口我這樣呼喊，覺得不大自然，因爲巳經許多時候沒有發這種聲音，近來往返校中都是走路的。</p>
<p>說明了我目的的地以後，車夫說要三千塊錢。記得前次因爲生病偶然坐了軍子，還只要八百元，正如剃頭，每次漲價，都得探問價目。雖然三千元的數目很是出我意料，却因爲情形已生疏，不好隨便還價，只顧自輕輕嘆了聲，「這樣貴！』</p>
<p>『二千塊，』對方聽了就認眞的接着說「先生！這不過是一升的米錢呢！，現在米這樣貴，拉軍子，總得吃飯，難道我多說了麽？』</p>
<p>『可是我們的薪水，』我說，「並沒有跟着米價增加。』</p>
<p>終於說定兩千元。從校中裝上米，在路上隆隆的拉着行動了。我坐在車上，米袋擋住了脚，很不舒服；在上橋下橋的時候，車夫顯得吃力，我是感到危險。轉了兩個彎，知道已無陡急的橋樑。米還是糙的，想就到有碾米機的店舖裏去軋白，就同車夫談起話來。</p>
<p>『你是紹興人麼？」從口音知道，是鄉親，我這樣探問。</p>
<p>「在這裏拉車子的有幾個不是紹興人，「他很快的回答，「拉車子是苦的，可是現在，黃包車要减少，連這苦飯都不好吃了。其實那個愛拉車子呢！我們本來是在機坊裏織綢織的。綢縀生意做不好，機坊倒了，這才只好拉車子。軍捐是又加了，一個月要十八萬，一天六千，兩個人拉上下班，每人每大都要白拉三千元。』</p>
<p>顯得很感慨；我想安慰他些話，却是無從說起。</p>
<p>『先生！』他忽然另行開端說，「米這樣貴，你們飯吃得省，還可以；我們用力氣的，要吃得多，眞是要不得呢！』</p>
<p>「我們也要不得呀！』我道　有話可說，「飯吃得省是以前的事，現在來來往往總是走路的，也用力氣；吃的，少油膩，肉這　貴，只好老是吃些菜；一來肚子餓，飯也就要多吃了！』</p>
<p>『你講得不錯，』他應和，『現在你們教書的先生，也苦了！」</p>
<p>提到軋米的事，他又慨嘆起來，說，「以前打米店，打米店，連軋米的機器都打掉許多。機器少了，米來不及軋，弄得更加困難。平價米總是糙的，一斗兩斗的簡直沒有地方肯給我們軋。糙米煮不化，吃下去不做肉。又不能積起三斗四斗去一道軋，有了米就得煮起飯來吃。先生！現在我們是這樣辦的，把糙米浸過夜，第二天撈起來煮，飯可以化些。」</p>
<p>這樣說了，似乎他已代我決定了辦法，一直把我拉到家裏來。雖然遷是初次談話，好像一見如故，我們已很接近，在生活困難的一點上。說起來他的收入比我稍微多些，生活的情形可並不比我的好。我所暗自羨慕的是他的刻苦精神比我强，來得堅決。</p>
<h3>不安定的靈魂</h3>
<p>— 李白鳳</p>
<p>彷彿　　杜斯退依夫斯基的「被侮辱與被損書的』一樣，我一看到那個跪在馬路邊上的盲員的老乞丐，就興起這種感覺。</p>
<p>兩隻瞎了的眼睛直視前面，像死魚的眼睛似的，凝固而且空虛，人生的歷程不曾在這上面記載下什麽，它是那樣空白，正和一張沒有落過　的白紙一樣。</p>
<p>它雖然看不見什麼，然而憑着他那乞求的聲音，我知道他是非常明白於來往的行人車馬的；他似乎辨淸細碎的脚步，是屬於衣著入時的女人的，而那昂然闊步，也知道是個頗爲得意的紳士……於是他呼號了，用各種不同的，因人而異的哀憐的喉音。</p>
<p>像一根被撥動了的琴弦，他底喉音老是那末顫巍巍的，若斷若續的。說出靈魂中最最動人的話語；然而，也許爲着思路的狹隘，也許爲了饑餓的大手扼住了咽喉，他所選用的辭彙是多末貧乏而且無力啊！試想：在這樣一個聲色狗馬的都市裏，有誰會被這一兩聲饑餓的呻吟打動的慈善家麽？</p>
<p>其實，並不由於人心的堅硬如石，實際上能够用心靈去思量和聽取的人眞是太少了，人們正忙於自拯於生活的深淵，那有心思去聽取他那帶着血淚的哀求呢？</p>
<p>他直挺挺地跪在水門汀石板上，雙手柱着一根手杖，像一株久經風雨的老樹，被一根支柱撑着立在廣原上，它底鬚根早已抓不住脚下的泥土了。</p>
<p>幾莖　鬚像　枯的茅草似的在微風裏　搖，無力的手指抓緊了手杖，像老樹的粗根抓牢了　石……：這是一座苦難的石像，說明了中國，也代表了中國！</p>
<p>行人車馬在他面前匆匆地來而又去，沒有誰會投給他輕輕的一瞥；在這繁華的鬧市中心，他底存在等於一塊石頭，一根朽木。</p>
<p>黃昏進入都市的時候，老人才顫巍巍地從水門汀石板路上站了起來，摩挲着手中的藤杖和幾張發皺了的鈔票，他不知道它們的價値，一直問着過路的人，同時又不相信每一個告訴他的人。</p>
<p>用手杖常做眼睛，這老盲人輕輕的嘆了口氣，好像帶着無限的歉意似的離開他那每天長跪着的石板路；我彷彿聽見一個不安定的聲音向我說</p>
<p>「別只是可憐那個你親眼看見了的，要可憐那千千萬萬你所未及看見的；別老是資助這行將入木的老人，你更應該扶掖那正在成長的幼小者……」</p>
<p>我茫然國顧，一些鶉衣百結的影子在面前幌搖；我知道他們都是一些　饑餓的不安定的靈魂，唯有在這不安定的國度裏，扌會有這些景象出現</p>

<p>究竟我離開昆明了，由於我曾到過許多城市，我熟習了住留在那兒和離開那兒時的心情，我特別避免「離開了的，不在目前的，都是好的』。這句話，對昆明也是一樣，即使在最煩厭的時候，我也會用理智對自己解說：「但她的許多地方，還是可愛啊。』而在今天，對那些本是可厭的，我依然要說：「罪惡啊」！</p>
<p>昆明和其他城市同樣有着政治機構的設置，但更糟的是比其他城市更煩亂而骯　，中華民族的忍耐性眞太大了，那些應該負責的人們，眼看着凹凸的路也不理會；眼看着餓載道也不管——尤其在廟會的時候，廟門外的路上　滿了一列列長及里餘的求乞人；眼看着到處荒山也不去栽上一棵樹，而且更在築蕭自己的罪惡的牆，厚厚地高高地築着，用那實際是卑鄙與汚穢而却以爲是高尚與光榮的磚土增築着。他們習以爲常了，還以此爲驕傲……</p>
<p>但凡屬自然所能擺佈的美麗都擺佈了，如那溫暖的不急躁的的氣候；那永遠是明淨與聳翠的湖山；和那永遠開不完的四季花……都太使人懷念了，而且也總有些懇摯的友情在那兒緊留着！雖然那同樣是來自遠方的人。</p>
<p>是昨大，從那公路邊的小樓走的，五月的淸晨，大楊樹嫩黃的幼葉，迎看初昇的陽光，顯得特別淸新而明麗，爽潔的空氣中沒有霧，有的却是草花與樹葉的氣息所匯成的凉氣，在空流中遊蕩着，錄　似的草坪收藏了一些小露珠，時時從行人的脚小向上透着一些涼意。</p>
<p>火車是在八時十分開出的，不管暫時或久遠，短別或永訣，總都是別了，望着那挺秀而葱鬱的山　，那明淨而平闊的湖水，那還殘留着祖先們所築造的長堤與長樹，以及那些善良的面孔，罪惡的形態都別了。</p>
<p>人，每個人都是這樣，一個個的認識了，再一個個的別去。想不到被淸晨過分的淸凉激得病了，開車不久就開始全身病起來，最初還在勉强支撑，漸後便不得不躺下，買了一個無人坐的頭等座位躺下了。車過的地方，都因病痛而不能去顧盼，與那車　上所映照的一些山山水水都無從爲別了，在這塲生之夢裏，誰知道能否再來，能否做「前度劉郎」？</p>
<p>由於自曲靖到需益要轉車，這可把我苦了。我幾乎已不能站起來，好容易請了一個鄰座的帮忙，把行李搬過去，然後再一顛一撲的爬上那沒有一點空隙的鐵翎車，斜靠在車門邊，眞危險極了，幾次嘔吐都向車外幌了幾幌。</p>
<p>在幾陣神智淸醒時，總是想到：完了，生命是完結了，像這樣定要倒下車去，不然，到霑益之一段，怕也無法支持；而且，那兒沒一個熟人即使尚存一點氣息又將如何？最好的辦法是明天再坐車回昆明，但那能挨到嗎？而且還能有餘力登上車廂碼？</p>
<p>盼天盼地似的盼到霑益了了，不知一種什麼力量竟使我未掉下車，未遭遇到那件可怕的事。車停了，我倒在車站上，矇矇隴　中由兩個脚夫抬到一個臨車站的旅館裏，還虧了兩個軍人給照料行李。</p>
<p>現在我已病愈了，是在昨天到旅館後一陣慌亂的情緒下找到一位醫生給治好了；那是在打過一針不到兩分鐘的時間內發出一身熱汗後痊好了。那正如驟雨後的疾風把那疾病的雲袋一掃而去。像道樣的病，我還是初次嘗試，那種兇猛與可怕眞是到極峯了。但平復那樣快也是第一遭，在那一刻，那舒暢的血琉一刹時便貫串到全身時，我貫在　異了。「謝謝先生，您這一針眞太靈，好了，完全好了」。一面在拭着激出的熱汗。</p>
<p>今天遵醫師囑休息一天，明晨又要踏向一條遙遠的，新的旅途了。這兒未曾留住我，未曾把我生命的燈光熄滅，希望與理想的碑石又豎起來，生命再延續下去，我像更生一樣蹦蹦跳跳地走向前，走向那茫茫地未來的旅途上去。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>耀羣聽我這麼一提，先是顰起了眉尖，搖了搖頭，後來又笑了起來：「這個傢伙，眼面前可以說眞是我們當中的一份子；因爲我們需要他供給情報。鬼子特工大本營裏，有好幾個地方我還走不進去；同時，我又聽不懂日本話……」</p>
<p>「您認爲他的情報十分可靠嗎」？我　口問。</p>
<p>「到目前爲止，他所供給的情報，不僅淸楚明白，並且確實可靠。至於往後怎麽樣，我可不敢說」。耀舉表示十分肯定似的。</p>
<p>「還有一點，您認爲她把所得到的情報，都儘量　給您了嗎」？關於這一點，我認爲很重要。</p>
<p>「那我可不敢說」。耀羣有些猶豫：「因爲道傢伙神通廣大，也許他收築的情報很多很多，給我知通的，也許就是這麽一部份。也許……」！</p>
<p>「那慶，您很有把握，知道這位買沙夫小姐，沒有在日本特務面前吐露一些關於咱們的工作消息嗎？假定她在我們和日寇雙方面之中，串演同樣的角色；換句話說，把日本方面的消息，酌量告訴我們一些，然後又把我們的悄息，完全轉告給日本特工，您認爲……</p>
<p>耀羣搖着頭，沉吟了一會：「也許有道麼一種情形，不過我個人的推測，認爲他不必幹這一套」。</p>
<p>「您這話有什麼據嗎」？對於道一點，我也認爲關係重大，不能不再三的向耀羣曉舌。</p>
<p>「很了不起的根據，也說不上。……要說有什麼根據……</p>
<p>耀羣說到道裏，眼睛裏忽然發出一陣奇光，好像掣電似的，閃爍了一下，一瞬即杳，揚起臉來，瞧着懸空的所在，似乎在仔細觀察他的幻想所映出的一種書片似的：「岳先生，我認爲那唯一的根據，乃是繫托在一個想像上面。這個想像，就是我觀察了他這幾天的行動。推演出來的一個結論……」</p>
<p>「噢」！我禁不住衝口而出，發出了這麽一個驚　的聲饗；可又害怕打斷了耀羣的思路，所以把他口裏的「結論」兩個字，重複了一遍。</p>
<p>「換句話說」，耀羣似乎沒有注意我的神色，仍舊繼續着說：「傻他這麽樣一個人，冒着性命的危險，在刀口，在火綫上，溜來溜去，究竟爲的什麽呢？，……必是有一個目的，不是嗎？對於他這個目的，眼面前我還不敢十分確定。不過我對於他的一切把握，都是繫托在這個片面的假定上」！</p>
<p>「可否……」我正想向耀羣，能不能把她的那個似定，描　一個輪廊出來。</p>
<p>「可是讓我把這個似定說明出來嗎」？耀羣還沒有等我把話說完，就　口這麽問我；一面問着，一面笑着搖了搖頭：「因爲害怕我這個「似定」，根木是錯誤的，所以我現在還不敢說。到目前爲止，在我心下，只於是當他一個『假定』而已。我想您心下當然也有一個「假定』。可是您和我這兩個『假定』，是否相同，我們暫且可以去管他；且等到了一定的關節，我希望在那個時候，我們可以彼此說明出來，對照一下」。</p>
<h3>寫作工具</h3>

<h3>談翎子</h3>
<p>— 羣琳</p>
<p>翎子即帽盔上倒插之鳥羽，長凡一二尺不等，以雉尾或孔雀之翎爲宜，此飾物初無定制，迄至淸初，定爲皇家恩賞之物，始爲人重視。『說文」無翎字，但中國古代雖無翎飾，却早已重羽毛，易經「其羽可用爲儀」之證。舊劇中常以雉尾飾於武將盔後，如飾於冠，亦可作文飾，謂之翹，班固白雉詩「發皓羽分　翹英」，又射雉賦「班尾揚翹「，段玉裁注「尾長毛必高舉，故凡高舉日翹」。</p>
<p>淸制的憚子，雖爲拖戴，實則尾亦翹舉，不過另以孔雀翎有眼者爲貴耳。在淸初，此原是專以賞武將中有功勳者，亦自是武飾成與羽林軍之說有關，古羽林在漢時，係天軍，是天子宿衛之官，亦釋曰如羽之疾，如林之多，但亦可想像其亦有翎毛之飾。淸制賞　翎者，猶是武人，凡領於衛府官　儀　滿員，護軍營，火器營，在五品以上者，情冠戴孔雀翎，而六品以下，只有一種藍翎，以爲辨別，其親王郡王府中，惟頭等護衝始許戴花翎，餘仍皆藍翎。且親工郡王員勒爲宗臣貴胃，向例皆不戴孔雀翎，惟貝子得戴三眼孔雀翎，以爲臣僚之冠。，乾隆時，有順承動郡王業英郊，以充前鋒統領，向高宗前乞賞花翎，帝日：『花翎乃員子應有，諾王戴之，反覺違制』，傳文忠公桓代奏「郡王年少，不過欲戴美觀耳」，帝始許之，由是親郡王及員勒屢亦有蒙恩賜者矣。乾隆帝更擬以五眼花翎爲親郡王定制，爲大學士和坤所阻，致未行。至於淸初勳臣中功蹟大者，亦間有特賜難眼花翎者。外省文臣，本無花翎之例，也是乾隆朝，有一位直隸總督方觀承，以拜命至古北口大閱，乃恃　請特賜花翎以北觀瞻，因頗得主眷。高宗笑：「看你這侏儒樣兒，也想　花翎嗎？」譏笑一番後，却還是賞給了他。嗣後開一例，外任疆疆的督撫大員，業賜花憚者，更見多矣。現今或有一般家庭中先　之神像，每於祭忌之日，懸掛壁上時，亦赫然朝服花翎，儼然一貴官，不論其生前是否領有恩賞，死後概以貴官憲之，或係自嘲耶。</p>
<p>戰爭秘史</p>
<p>——　使美軍登陸上每。鮑忠祈。</p>
<p>當第二次世界大戰末期的時候，日軍在太平洋各島嶼上節節敗退，美軍已迫近日木本土各島，一般的猜測，美軍的戰略：登陸日本本土；登陸中國沿海口岸，前後夾攻，截斷中國大陸上日軍的歸路，當時擬定的四個登陸地點是葫蘆島，上海附近，福州，廣州附近，其中以登陸上海附近的可能性最大。</p>
<p>爲了呼應這件　大的登陸　劃，在重慶的中國最高作戰當局，曾經召集了各部門的負責人員商討會議，並成立生產局，專事策　呼應美軍登陸作戰。</p>
<p>當時估計上海居民的在一百五十萬至一百七十萬左右，如果戰爭發生以後，可能有百分之二十五仍留居上海，他們的食糧將由糧食部供應麵食；同時，上海的幾個重要轟炸據點，已得委員長　　准，後方已派員通知上海的居民撤退，可是那時交通治安已極混亂，居民無法疏散，幸而戰爭及平結束，否則不堪設想。</p>
<p>那時最重要的議題是煤興電的供應，假想上海電力設備全部毀　，登陸車隊所需的煤電量極大，巾國最近的煤　地是宜興，必須將路軌啣接至煤礦　在地，或用卡車裝運都很困難，所以「煤」決定由美國或菲烈濱用飛機運送。</p>
<p>當然，這樣一件工作所需要的人才與設備爲數相當可觀，當局已專撥十五架飛機，三十輛卡車作爲運輸之用，火車至少每日裝車三千噸。同時，杜月笙先生已受任在立煌成立駕駛大隊，一旦戰時發生，立刻可以動員幾千人。</p>
<p>至於醫藥機械等設施也均加以考慮，一切都已有充分的準備</p>
<p>最可以顯出計劃的週密是：美軍詢問中國農業專家，何種菜籽最易長大，以備萬一糧食供給發生困難的時候，食糧不致有斷絕之處。</p>
<p>甚麽工作都已準備就緒，美軍船艦也巳迫近中國沿海，只等九月聞的太平洋　風襲過，醞釀着的上海登陸立刻要實現的。</p>
<p>可是，原子彈的發明提早了戰爭的結束，沒有等這個計劃的實現，日本已屈膝投降了，固然，勝利挽救了不少戰士的生命，也使幸運的上海不受戰爭的蹂躪，倒是突如其來的勝利，後方復員工作的未能有所準備，使戰後。接收工作，到處呈現着混亂的現象，很令人感嘆萬分呢！</p>
<h3>悼兪頌華先生</h3>
<p>— 陳禮江</p>
<p>吳天不弔，哲人遽萎，余於兪頌筆先生之逝世，不僅爲私交吳，更爲公誼慟，蓋兪先生之不獲享大年，不僅爲本院之不幸，實爲國家之巨大損失。</p>
<p>余與兪先生訂交，始於民國十六年，時余與兪先生之令妹慶棠女士及高踐四先生遊，因得識先生，嗣先生主編申報月刊，余時以文章就正，交誼益篤。戰時常聚首於陪都。卅四年夏本院創設新聞學係，且的在訓練以推得社會敎育爲職志之新聞從業人材，適與先生平時所主張者相　合，經余一再敦請，遂欣然允就主任之聘。自先生就聘後，工作異常努力，一面擬訂計劃，物色教授，一面親自敎學，孜孜不倦。海內各大學之設有新聞系者。如北平之燕京，上海之復且，及中央政治學校，固已著有成績，而由兪先生主持之本院新聞學系則卓然別其風格，其訓練學生不僅使爲新聞從業人員，並欲使其爲能担任教育工作者，不僅使具備從事「記者」與「教育者」之能力，而且使有高尚之人生觀與夫以報務爲至上之信念。其訓練學生之方法，着重在個別談話，凡與其幾度談話之學生，莫不翻然改悟，而爲一有崇高理想之靑年，確然具有將以敎育者之態度從事新聞事業之信念。古人云：「以身教者從」，蓋先生人格高尚，態度誠篤，故諾生翕然從之也。有天假之年，蔚成風氣，我國「新聞」與「教育」，將並受其益，惜乎先生竟一病不起也！</p>
<p>衰耗忽傅，舉國痛　，有謂先生爲新聞界之標準人物，有稱先生爲新聞界之阿　佛，然余以爲先生畢生之車業，雖在新聞，而先生最終之目的，則在教育。先生不僅是位李有大名之新聞從業人員，而是一位乎有儒者氣象之敎育家。先生之主編新聞，是以報紙爲推行敎育之工具，先生之從事教育，是以培養「文行並茂」之新聞從業員爲　的。先生之主持本院新聞壓系，僅及二年，時間雖基短，而成效已大，將永留於本院，永留於教育</p>
<p>先生體素不健，戰時東西播遷，身體益憊，然對於其所負之任務，從不因身體之軟弱，而有時一刻之意忽，自主持本院新聞學系以來，爲欲實現其理想，更焦心苦思以從事於系務之推進。今年八月以後幾度吐血，於呻吟床褥之際，猶急急於物色優良教授，擬訂敎學計劃，其忠於職守之精神，誠可謂「難躬盡瘁」。</p>
<p>先生性剛正，而遇人和淑，視諾生如子姪，愛之以至誠，故先生逝世之日，諸生成痛哭失聲，同仁亦多欷歔下淚，而余則惜哲人之遠萎，念疇昔之交誼，感慨萬端，情何能盡，　撰斯文，以誌吾悲。</p>
<h3>特任南極大使</h3>
<p>— 沙洲</p>
<p>美國的總統，在習慣上每年至少必須參加華盛頓「民族報界俱樂部」的宴會一次，一九四〇年羅斯福大總統在這宴會上實發生一件趣事。</p>
<p>常時許多客人環繞着這位貴賓，爭　求他在紀念册上簽名，以留紀念，有一個名呌伯烈特（H·M·Bratter）的記者，取一張菜單，在背面寫着：「特任　烈特爲駐北極大使」字樣，再把它對摺了，將這幾個字遮去，下面留着空白地位，以備簽名，然後在人叢中；把這張紙頭和許多他人的紀念册雜在一起，送到羅斯福面前。</p>
<p>不久；果然這張菜單簽好了名送了回來，可是羅斯福却沒有上他的當，原來當伯烈特打開着時，羅斯福已將「北」字塗去，改寫「南字」，下面還駐着道；「北極已有人」</p>
<h3>兩個回敎領袖</h3>
<p>— 破輪</p>
<p>耶路　冷　敎大敎主赫賽尼，是耶路撤冷一百二十萬伯伯人的領袖，極受阿刺伯人的擁戴。雖然阿刺伯國家政治上顯得分歧，但他們對於獨立之心頗切，阿刺伯的政黨領袖時常鼓勵刺激阿刺伯民族，要他們從速團結起來，保衛阿刺伯民族。由於赫賽尼的主動，阿刺伯的堅强抵抗份子在申東組織了一個秘密同盟的團體，行動和美國的三K黨相似。人數其有五萬人，他們都受　軍事訓練，他們受阿刺伯同盟的指揮，他們所要對付的是猶太人。</p>
<p>道個秘密團體的領袖名叫哈瓦里，今年才三十八歲。他是一個身材短小而長得結實的男子。他的模樣正像一個足球教練，他主張每一個阿刺伯男子應該娶四個妻子，因爲這是回教的風俗所許可的，這樣才可以使阿刺伯仁口業　起來，永遠地可以抵制猶太殖民。哈瓦里有一個大人，却生了九個孩子。他幼時深受了反對猶太人的敎訓，因爲他　父的產業都賣給了猶太人。所以他是個赤手空空貧賽的阿刺伯人；但他發奮謂書，對於數學，尤具研究；他設立學校，　刺向阿孩子中說猶太人的罪惡，同時還教導阿刺伯小孩子不要相信外國人，唯有自己努力掙扎，才顯得力量。一九二九年阿刺伯人曾對猶太人進動大屠殺的舉動，亦出自哈瓦里的主動。</p>
<p>哈瓦里曾說這樣話：「阿刺伯靑年都在受軍事訓練，阿刺伯人知道西方國家不能對阿刺伯有一絲帮助，所以只有自己組織起來解決自己的問題。如今阿刺伯人都要實現未來的理想，準備自身的力量，金錢和軍力，來獲取最後的成功。」麗</p>
<h3>國慶訪墓有感</h3>
<p>— 麗</p>
<p>「出師未捷身先死，長使英雄淚滿襟」，我兄你愛了國家，丟下了性命，痛苦一刹那，在你無所謂，願意犧牲竟成了志願，害得阿姐掛了空名，早起　眠，忍飢耐寒，餐風飲露，汗流奔波，十載苦况，訴與維聽？燕子亦有歸來之日，問你爲何不歸？你告訴我爲了一只鵝老鷹，害爹害娘把你吞下去，吐在斯且丁，設來我亦不忍聽，鵝老騰，人家看你爲科學萬能，在我心中，成了一世寃家對象。</p>
<p>今日我拿什慶來拜望你，想你生前轟轟烈烈不願與草木同朽，如今同胞都醉生夢死，爭權奪利。我想你心裏一定毫不痛快，我在你前，愧不獻花，謹以心香鞠躬致敬，今日欣逢國慶，在你面前下拜是値得的，你過去的歷史是値得崇拜的；雖然園內無人，雀鴉無聲，寒風刺骨彷彿與你觀面，毫無怕懼，坐在你前，默受你的教訓，萬分快樂，臨別依依，所以寫一行字於石碑上以留紀念。姐想你活在世上，希望你活在我們中間，你知道否？回顧國家，民不聊生，你休息在天，用不着操心，這是你的福氣，我告訴你阿姐康健，民兒向學，現已天明苦盡甘來，你九泉有知，可合笑瞑目矣！</p>
<p>註：鵝老鷹飛機也。</p>
<h3>滬上兩特殊區域</h3>
<p>— 輝</p>
<p>地為與金利源碼頭上海地壇，淸季爲上海這縣歲時祭享之所，在老北門外，道光劃界之初被圈於法界內，咸豐初，滬道以其地爲祭祀公地，因之公共租界內之天后宮獨立自主爲例，與法領交涉收回，其後太平軍之亂，江浙富紳大賈，紛紛避亂至滬，　居法界，法界當局爲謀繁盛，遂又將地壇擴展與街衢，建樓設肆，原地全失，令日與滬人道地　，恐已無人能詳言其事矣。</p>
<p>其次爲沿黃浦灘一帶舊法租界之金利源碼頭。淸末，該地貨　櫛比，述綿達二里許，乃招商局之不動產。招商同爲盛宣懷所創，成立於光緒初年，開闢之初，因法界已無地皮可購，更無從建屋，乃與鉅工，在黃浦江中鞏地塡土，與江水爭地，耗資無算，卒底於成，故此一碼頭，望之似凸出於江中，　然半島，營業卽繁盛，權亦純自主，因之法界當局屢借機進言交涉，盛氏則以「此地係我從江中塡出，與你們界址全不相涉」爲抗爭理由，卒能保全。余日對載不至上海，渝海桑田，當不知變遷如何矣。</p>
<h3>影壇一週</h3>
<p>— 李箴</p>
<p>「甦鳳記」從「甦鳳記」的劇本中，我們無從發現它的主題，讓觀衆看完了這個戰，捉摸不到劇作者所需要表現的是什麼？有的只是一段段熱鬧的情飾。因位劇作者一味的在賣弄故事，使這個女伶的悲劇，被吊在雲霧義，觀衆也被推在　喪看花，雖然花稍，也很熱鬧，但結果是空無師有。</p>
<p>劇中坤伶學蓮秋，性格軟弱而又矛盾，她並無積極的向上要求，最後的自殺更是勉强，作爲一個悲劇的女主人，遺樣的人物，實在太無力量了。另一個正而人物新聞記者劉成之，他那漂亮的言詞，掩蓋不了他自私私與　　的行爲，他與李伶的戀愛，更是劇作者的硬凑合。而冒充空軍隊長的騙子，反而在故事巾格外被渲染，所以這個戲弄得一段段很熱鬧，但又段段　節，不能一氣呵成。即使丟開了劇本的內容，在編劇的技術上，也是下承之作。</p>
<p>我們惋悟湯曉丹繼「天堂　夢」後導演了這個戲，即使把北海與頤和圍的風景處理得更美一點，依然挽救不了像戲中結尾時那樣草率與鬆解。</p>
<p>演出上，眞是難爲了演員，李　秋的性格卽矛盾又糢糊，路明能樸實的處理這個角色，確是不易。項　的袁隊長浮澡無深度，史弘演來呆滯而流氣，極爲生硬，演小金花的周婷，頗爲自然得體，全劇以路明與周婷成績較隹。</p>
<p>「六宮粉黛」宣傳已久的這部五彩片「六宮粉黛」，並不如預料巾的精彩，雖然那彩色是相當艷麗的，演出塲面也極熱鬧，但劇本的編製較爲鬆懈，戲的發展也少過程，誇張的噱頭於這裏穿插得頗多，縱然是彩色艷麗，仍無補於整個戲的構成。</p>
<p>「新慾燄」「新　燄」是部法國片，故事描寫一段多角戀愛，它的原名叫「暴風雨」象微着在情慾激動中的愛情，格調頗新穎。</p>
<p>「俠盜平番」它强調了人性的善良，但　些溫情主義，事實上還是不可能的吧。</p>
<p>童星瑪格麗奧白蘭十分可愛，使你無法不喜歡她，雖然此片成續，不如她的「靑鄕碧玉」。　倫斯皮萊的粗錢條作風，同樣不會使你失望。</p>
<h3>疊字漫掇</h3>
<p>— 王樹旌</p>
<p>古人詞曲中疊字之妙者，如李淸照之聲聲慢起首幾句云：「尋尋覓覓，冷冷淸淸，悽悽慘慘戚戚」堪稱妙手。他如喬吉天淨紗小令「鶯鶯燕燕春春，花花柳柳眞眞，事事風風韻韻，嬌嬌嫩嫩，停停當當人人」。吳梅先生評爲「淸俊秀麗，不　大家」；然春春眞眞等字，未免尙有牽强之嫌，但此爲韻脚，欲易固亦未能勝也。（按喬吉字夢符，太原人，又號笙鶴翁，）至如王實甫西廂記之越調鬥鵪鶉下段及紫花兒序中云：「側着耳朶兒聽，躡着脚步兒行，悄悄冥冥，潛潛等等，等我那齊齊整整，嬝嬝婷婷，組姐鷥鷥」，則信手拈來，更覺天衣無　矣。</p>

<p>嗣母作主代訂婚約　引起解除婚約的糾紛</p>
<p>編輯先生：敝人男性，年廿二歲，十二業時由嗣母作主，馮媚與同鄉同年王姓女訂婚。當時敝人未予同意。十八歲時敝人選離西行時，曾兩度托族人通知對方表示否認此項婚約，但對方一味推延，且有脅迫成婚之意，敵人爲對付起見，乃登報解除正式申明否認此項婚約，對方亦登報反駁，大意謂：「訂婚巳十餘年，是否合法？當有媒人證明，成年已逾二載，果女方有名譽和精神之預失，該家長應負賠償之責」此事延宕迄今業巳年餘，敝人心中始終不安，茲有疑問數則請予解答：　上項婚約是否有效？彼之反駁是否合理。　對方所云延宕時日，是否應負賠償之責？　對方家長聲稱，不賠鉅款，永不解約，今後若以非法手段相威脅，應如何對付？　敝人是否須先向法院起訴？　如法院判決男方應負法律責任一切損失是否山男方負担？續者周同强上</p>
<p>〔傳况　律師答〕　本人成年不同意法定代理人所訂婚釣自可聲明解除。　無過失之一方得向有過失之他方請求賠償其因此所受之損害。　可邀媒妁調解賠　數額。　無先行起訴之必要。　果係責任在男方自應負賠償之責。</p>

<h3>US Congress to Discuss Aid to China; Grain Relief to be Shipped to Shanghai Within the Year; Chow Yih-deh Meets Chairman Chiang, Discusses Political Situation</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 3rd] It is reported here on the 3rd that after Senate President Vandenberg returns this week, the State Department's secret handling of General Wedemeyer's report on China will be brought up for discussion at the special congressional session to be held on the 17th. Vandenberg will have several members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Appropriations Committee. They advocate that the government provide Congress with full details of the plans for foreign aid, including plans related to China. It is said that some senators feel that the United States is moving slowly on aid to China while the Marshall Plan for European aid is nearing completion. They hope to know how much money and goods will be needed to strengthen the anti-communist forces of the Chinese National Government. They hope to see Wedemeyer's recommendations, believing that he is proposing large-scale aid to China.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The first batch of grain for aid to China, transported under the Sino-US relief agreement, is expected to arrive in Shanghai within the year. This move will greatly help stabilize grain prices. According to the agreement, the United States will assist us with 200,000 tons of grain, including 120,000 tons of rice and 80,000 tons of wheat, and US$5 million in medical supplies. It is also learned that the first batch of grain we purchased separately in the United States will also arrive in Shanghai within the year and will be sold in Shanghai to suppress grain prices, and the proceeds will be used to purchase grain in domestic production areas and transport it to disaster-stricken areas.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Chairman Chiang received US Congressman Chow Yih-deh at 5:00 PM on the 3rd. Chow was accompanied by Ambassador Stuart. He tried his best to converse with the Chairman in Mandarin, which was translated by Secretary Shen Chang-huan. They exchanged views on the current situation in China.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] Ambassador Stuart and US Congressman Chow Yih-deh flew to Nanjing yesterday morning at about 9:00 AM. Chow is scheduled to come to Shanghai again today to meet with people from all walks of life to exchange opinions on the current situation. Tomorrow, he will return to the United States by special plane to prepare for the special congressional session on the 17th of this month.</p>
<h3>Chow Yih-deh Tells Tseng Chi That He Will Call for Aid to China Upon Returning Home</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] US Congressman Chow Yih-deh met with Tseng Chi, Chairman of the Chinese Youth Party, and Hsieh Cheng-ping, a member of the Party's Central Committee, at the US Embassy at 2:00 PM on the 3rd. Tseng raised two points: 1. Since General Marshall returned to the United States, the US policy toward China seems to be hesitant. What is the reason for this? I am puzzled. 2. China has a vast territory and a large population, and its relationship to world peace is at least no less than that of Turkey. Why is the United States putting aid to China on the back burner? Chow replied: The US public opinion on China does have some misunderstandings, because many of the reporters who came to China in the past were left-leaning and had preconceived notions, so they often distorted the facts. For a time, the people felt quite confused, but now it is gradually becoming clearer and leaning towards aiding China. I have called for aid to China four times in Congress. I will continue to work hard after I return to the United States. He also asked Tseng what kind of aid to China would be the most appropriate? Tseng replied: Aid to China must be comprehensive, including economic, military, and political aspects. The economic aid can be divided into two types: (a) political loans and (b) economic loans. The former is limited, while the latter can be unlimited because China itself should strive for "self-reliance," while the "goodwill assistance" of friendly countries is also welcomed by us. Tseng also asked Chow to pay attention to the "urgency" and "time-sensitivity" of aid to China. Chow is a medical practitioner. Tseng also used the analogy of "delaying medical treatment," saying that if a curable disease is not treated in time, there will inevitably be regret. Chow expressed his agreement. The two met for about 30 minutes.</p>
<h3>The United States Should Replenish the Domestic Market to Support the Strength of Allied Nations. Chow Yih-deh Discusses US Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Chow Yih-deh, a member of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, returned to the capital with Ambassador Stuart on the morning of the 3rd and immediately held a reception for reporters at the Ambassador's residence at 11:00 AM. Chow first spoke extensively on US policy toward China, saying that he did not know what the US government was currently considering, but his personal opinion was that more assistance should be given. He did not understand the reason why the government had to keep General Wedemeyer's report confidential. Some parts of the report may be confidential and only for government reference, but there is no reason for the recommendations to be kept secret. He believes that this action by the White House prevents the American people from knowing what they are doing. If they are afraid that publishing Wedemeyer's recommendations will affect Congress's consideration of Secretary of State Marshall's plan for European aid, then this decision is a harmful mistake. The Marshall Plan will provide US$20 billion in aid to Europe, while there is no aid for the Far East, which is unfair and inevitably biased. In the Far East, Japan has lost its ability to defend itself, and South Korea is in adversity. If China cannot be a strong ally of the United States in the East, the United States will continue to expend its strength in Japan and South Korea without achieving a stable situation. Therefore, the US policy toward China should be determined, announced, and implemented as soon as possible. As for whether the recent rise in prices in the United States will delay its foreign aid, he acknowledged that it is very important. He said that certain countries (especially the Soviet Union) are spreading rumors that the United States is about to encounter an economic crisis, but they still hope to obtain loans or other assistance from the United States. If the United States helps other countries, it must risk the danger of economic recession and high prices, but if it does not help other countries, many independent countries will gradually collapse due to economic crisis. The United States must choose a proper path, on the one hand, increasing production to replenish the domestic market, and on the other hand, providing assistance to support the independence of friendly countries. This will be a matter for Congress to consider carefully. (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>

<h3>Yu Pin Speaks in the United States, Says That There Is No Civil War in China, But Rather a Resistance Against International Communist Groups</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] New York, 3rd Broadcast: Philadelphia News, Bishop Yu Pin gave a speech to the clergy here on the 3rd, saying: The war in China is not a civil war, but a war against international communist groups. Currently, the Chinese army is fighting one million communists in northern China, among whom are Koreans, Japanese, and Soviets. He also said that China's urgent task is to make the United States understand that China is not fighting a civil war, but fighting communism, and is becoming a new victim of aggression. The Communist Party also does not call this war a civil war, but calls it the initial conflict in the worldwide war between democracy and communism.</p>
<h3>Burma Sends Personnel to China to Prepare for the Establishment of an Embassy</h3>

<h3>Regulations on Penalties for Gold and Currency Trading; Ministry of Finance and Relevant Parties Discuss Revisions</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The Regulations on Penalties for Gold and Currency Trading have been in effect for more than half a year since they were promulgated and implemented in April of this year. There are many areas that need to be revised. The Ministry of Finance and relevant parties are currently discussing them. It is heard that the main areas that need to be revised include the following: 1. Objects of punishment: According to Articles 1 and 2 of the original regulations, only firms that buy and sell gold and currency without government permission are subject to punishment. The Ministry of Finance believes that the scope is too narrow and proposes to include underground banks. 2. Article 3 of the original regulations stipulates that the gold and currency held by the perpetrator shall be confiscated. The Ministry of Finance believes that the gold and currency transaction is the act of both the buyer and the seller, and both parties should be punished equally. Punishing only one party is unfair. 3. Article 7 of the original regulations stipulates that there should be restrictions on bringing foreign currency into the country. The Ministry of Finance believes that the amount of foreign currency brought into the country should not exceed US$100. The legislative side believes that US$100 is too little. As for overseas Chinese passing through the country, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that the amount exceeding US$100 can be deposited in customs and retrieved within 30 to 40 days with a certificate.</p>

<h3>Sun Liren Arrives in Taiwan; Training Review Meeting Held in Pingtung</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Taipei, 3rd] Sun Liren, accompanied by US Advisor Colonel Bohlin and seven others, and four staff members, arrived in Taiwan by special plane from Shanghai at 2:40 PM on the 3rd. Sun is scheduled to fly to Pingtung on the 4th to convene a training review meeting. However, the Kaohsiung barracks are still under construction, and the budget requires NT$500 million. Three US military advisors, including Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Rentz, arrived in Taiwan by special plane at 12:00 PM and will visit Hao Chung and the Air Force Commander to discuss training matters.</p>
<h3>Sino-Dutch Air Transport Agreement; Both Countries Can Approve</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The Sino-Dutch Air Transport Agreement can be approved by the governments of both countries. This agreement was finalized in early July of this year. At that time, the Dutch side suggested using Hong Kong as an intermediate station, which our side did not agree to. It is heard that the main navigation area in the future will be the Dutch East Indies first, because there are many overseas Chinese there, and our relationship with them is also deep. After the agreement is signed, Batavia, Surabaya, and China routes will be opened first.</p>
<h3>Ryukyu Islands Should Be Returned to Our Country; The Philippines Actually Expresses Opposition and Asks Taiwan to "Self-Determine" Its Future</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 3rd] The Manila Bulletin reported on the 3rd that the Philippines will oppose any movement to return the Ryukyu Islands to China. A Philippine Foreign Ministry official said that the country's representative will oppose this proposal at the peace conference with Japan and submit the matter to the United Nations. It is said that the Philippine government opposes this proposal because if the Ryukyu Islands are placed under the jurisdiction of a foreign country, the Philippines' position may be in danger. The Philippines will demand that the Ryukyu Islands be placed under trusteeship and will demand that the political status of Taiwan be "self-determined." Another official said that the United States may not be willing to give up control of the Ryukyu Islands.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 3rd] Regarding the Philippine opposition to our country's demand to recover the Ryukyu Islands, as reported in the Manila Bulletin, Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino and Vice Foreign Minister Africa did not express any opinions this morning. Other officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Palace said that they "had never heard of this matter" and therefore could not confirm or deny it. However, according to reporters from other sources, the Philippine government does have the intention to oppose it, and long before President Zhang Qun announced to the Standing Committee of the National Political Council that China would demand the recovery of the Ryukyu Islands, a certain official of the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already drafted a plan for the Philippines to express its opposition to this. Observers here are surprised by the Philippine side's attitude, because it is still unknown whether the Philippines will be invited to attend the peace conference with Japan.</p>
<p>(Note: The return of Taiwan to our country has been agreed to by the four major powers and has become an established fact. The Philippine side's sudden proposal is incomprehensible. As for the Ryukyu Islands, it is a historical, geographical, and cultural necessity that they should be returned to our country. The Philippine side's opinion can be said to be lacking a thorough understanding of the facts.)</p>
<h3>US Officials in Tokyo Say That They Should Be Managed by US Officials</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 3rd] High-ranking US military officers here today responded to reporters' questions regarding the opinions of China and the Philippines demanding to take over the Ryukyu Islands, saying that the Ryukyu Islands currently occupy a major position in Pacific defense and "should continue to be managed by the United States." They believe that the United States has already "lost" Korea, and the expansion of Soviet power on the Asian continent is difficult to avoid. The importance of the Ryukyu Islands has therefore increased and must be used as an advanced air force base to protect the US position in the Pacific and, in conjunction with bases in Guam and the Aleutian Islands, to prevent any offensives from the mainland to the Pacific. As for maintaining a large army in Japan, it will be useless.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Amending the Postal Law; Two Committees of the Legislative Yuan Will Discuss</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Regarding the increase in postal rates, because postal rates are stipulated by the Postal Law, each adjustment requires amending the law, which is very inconvenient. In view of this, the Ministry of Communications recently submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to propose amending the Postal Law, deleting the postal rate table attached to Article 4 of the law, and adding a clause "The postal rates for each item mentioned above and the types and postal rates for items other than the aforementioned shall be drafted by the Ministry of Communications and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval."

The Legal System and Economic Committees of the Legislative Yuan will hold a joint meeting on the morning of the 4th to discuss this matter.</p>

<h3>Anshan Iron and Steel Works' Initial Stage of Recovery Faces Severe Tests; Lack of Coal, Food, and Funds Are the Three Current Difficulties</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Pan Yang, 3rd] The Anshan Iron and Steel Works, which began its initial stage of recovery in August, has once again fallen into a quagmire of difficulties after only three months. The development of heavy industry in the Northeast is facing a severe test. The three major problems currently are lack of coal, food, and funds. This month, the minimum coal requirement is 41,000 tons, but the Materials Adjustment Committee only allocated 11,000 tons. The monthly food requirement is 150 tons. 300 tons of rice were purchased from Shanghai and transported to Huludao, but due to the railway being cut off, it cannot be transported to Anshan. Due to the lack of funds, employee salaries also cannot be paid on time. The General Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Works, Bu Yiti, has arrived in Pan. He is running around everywhere. If the coal problem cannot be solved, the factory will be forced to shut down. There is currently no coal in the factory. The difficulties with food and funds will affect normal production. The difficulties of Anshan Iron and Steel are worthy of attention. People cannot bear to see the recovery become desolate and bleak again.</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhou Yide's Talk</h3>
<p>[Continued from Page 1] He believes that Congress will definitely approve a comprehensive and consistent foreign policy towards all countries, and will not hesitate to provide assistance, because assisting other countries is also assisting the United States. Mr. Zhou believes that the US Congress will not approve a supervisory policy for foreign aid, but may agree to implement assistance through advisors and observers, and ensure that the benefits of assistance fully benefit the people of the aided country. He declined to comment on the differences between Marshall and Wedemeyer's views on China and the suggestions of some people that China should receive aid only after reforms, as well as the innovations of the current government. He only pointed out that, in any case, the current US policy towards China is unsuccessful. Regarding the government's declaration that the Democratic League is illegal, he initially stated that as an outsider, he should not express opinions on this internal affair of China, but then hesitated slightly and said: "What I can say is that the government should present evidence on this matter and go through legal procedures to clarify it and make it public, so as to avoid assisting anti-government propaganda." Later, Mr. Zhou explained his views on the Chinese Communist Party, stating that since June, he has traveled around the world and personally witnessed that there is no democracy or freedom in Eastern European countries under the Soviet system. The CCP has never declared that it will abandon its attempt to Sovietize China, and its actions of destroying transportation and the economy directly harm the people. He opposes the Soviet-style dictatorship of the proletariat, so he also opposes the CCP. Mr. Zhou also pointed out that the National Government has confidence in democracy, saying that during the period of stability from 1931 to 1937, it fully demonstrated its determination to implement democratic politics and achieved considerable results. The Three Principles of the People can be expected to benefit China and the world. Mr. Zhou finally praised Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: "Regardless of how maliciously criticized by some Chinese and foreigners, Chiang Kai-shek is absolutely loyal to China." He believes that the stability and peace of the Far East depend on the efforts of a strong China under the leadership of Chairman Chiang.</p>
<h3>Meeting of the National Assembly Representatives' Association</h3>
<p>[Continued from Page 1] According to reports, the State Council rejected the association’s proposal, stating that it had no legal basis. The association argued that the government was just paying lip service and did not address practical matters. The association could also publicly announce certain illegal facts in the constitutional process. For example, the original regulations on constitutional laws and regulations stipulated that they should be promulgated within three months after the promulgation of the Constitution. However, in fact, the National Assembly Election and Recall Law was only promulgated on May 1st, and calculated from May 1st, the election should be completed within six months, that is, before the end of October. However, on September 8th, the State Council decided to postpone it for another month, so the deadline for handling the election has reached seven months. This is an illegal act by the government. The government has no right to change the preparatory procedures for implementing the Constitution, and the government's reason for postponing the election is "the three parties failed to reach an agreement on nominations." Now, the majority of areas across the country cannot hold elections. Why was the request for postponement rejected? At that time, some people proposed that the government's unconstitutional facts could be announced. After heated discussion, the text of the telegram was submitted to a small group for review. The main points of the case are as follows: The association's previous suggestion to the National Government by 688 people was based on nine major reasons, and did not quote the words "a request for convening by more than two-fifths of the number of people" listed in Article 30, Paragraph 4 of the Constitution. However, the State Council did not respond to the nine major reasons, and was rejected abruptly, which is regrettable. According to Article 9 of the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution, the National Assembly representatives who formulated the Constitution are responsible for promoting the implementation of the Constitution. Regarding the preparatory procedures for constitutional government, the government's various measures, such as the regulations on the election of pacification zones and overseas Chinese, lack a legal basis. The National Assembly representatives, based on their mission, have the right to request the convening of the National Assembly to review them.</p>
<h3>Central Election Committee Passes Opening and Counting Methods</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The Central Election Committee recently issued instructions to election offices at all levels on the opening and counting methods for various elections. The voting for various elections, the National Assembly, and the Legislative Yuan are stipulated in the provisional regulations of the Election and Recall Law, and should be completed within three days. In areas with a large number of voters, difficulties are inevitable, especially with opening and counting. At a time when transportation is inconvenient, it is not easy to transport ballots. Centralized opening poses many difficulties. In addition, it is stipulated that the list of elected candidates should be announced within ten days. Therefore, under these circumstances, the competent election authority can consider the situation and open the ballots separately, and order all elected candidates' vote counts to be listed first in remote areas and notified by telegram, and then send the ballots and the documents that should be reported by mail. When opening the ballots, a classification method can be used. After opening the ballot boxes in public, call out the names one by one. Place the votes of each candidate for each type of election in one place, and divide them into several places. After calling out all the names, organize and check the votes of each elected candidate, and bundle them separately, indicating the name and number of votes. This method was approved by the Central Election Committee.</p>
<h3>The Complete List of Kuomintang National Assembly Candidates Will Soon Be Finalized</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and the Central Election Guidance Committee continued to hold a joint meeting on the 3rd to review the list of National Assembly candidates in various provinces and cities. It is reported that except for Xinjiang and some pacification zones and national professional groups, the lists of various provinces and cities have been reviewed and finalized. The list of candidates for national professional groups will continue to be reviewed in the coming days, and the entire list will soon be officially submitted to the General Election Office.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Regarding the election of Legislative Yuan members from national professional groups, the provincial and municipal election offices are legally the competent authorities, and the national election office is the higher authority. Except for municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan, which still apply the original regulations, the provincial election offices cannot directly handle matters such as voter registration. The Central Election Office has presented a report to the National Government for recordation, allowing the offices to entrust county and municipal election offices to handle them.</p>
<h3>The Yongli Nitric Acid Plant Is Returned to Our Country</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) The factory was originally located in Jiangsu Province. In March 1942, it was plundered by the Japanese. It is hoped that the factory can be transported back to Shanghai in early spring next year by the Yongyuan, a Chinese steamship stolen by the Japanese in 1943. Our side began negotiating with the Allied Headquarters for the return of the factory last spring. According to the report of the Chinese experts sent by the Yongli Chemical Company to inspect the current situation of the plundered factory, part of the original equipment has been damaged or modified. New equipment was added during the war to maintain the factory's production. Many technical difficulties were encountered during the negotiations, that is, whether the entire factory (including the new equipment added in Japan after the plunder) should be returned to China, or only the original equipment that had decayed due to the passage of time. The Chinese representatives believed that the factory was in good production condition when it was robbed, and that returning only the old and broken original equipment would not benefit China at all. In order to respect the opinions of the Chinese representatives, it has now been decided to return the entire factory. The entire factory is worth a total of US$500,000, and its daily production is 10 tons of nitric acid.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 3rd] It is reported that on the 30th of last month, a batch of 704 overseas Chinese arrived here in the steerage of the Yi Wassi-Fer quoted steamship.

<h3>A Twelve-Year-Old Mystery; The Main Culprit, Wang Huayi, Is Arrested; The Beiping Box Corpse Case</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] Wang Huayi (now using the alias Wang Zongyao), the main culprit in the sensational Beiping East Railway Station Box Corpse Case twelve years ago, was arrested a few days ago at No. 40, Dongsi 7th Alley, for drug use. It can be said that the net of heaven is wide, and no one can escape it. According to reports, in early 1936, a passenger at the Beiping East Railway Station entrusted the shipment of two blue and purple lacquered iron boxes to Pan Yang. When they were weighed, they were too heavy and had to be opened for inspection. The passenger said he would go home to get the key, but never returned. This aroused the suspicion of the railway station. When the boxes were opened, they contained the corpse of a man, dismembered into eight pieces and packed into the two boxes. After investigation by the military police, the accomplice Li Liangjing was arrested, and it was learned that the main culprit in the case was Wang Huayi. Wang was from Suning, Hebei. He once served as the director of the military affairs office in Sui Province. He resigned in 1930 and came to Beiping to live as a gentleman. Although Wang had many wives and concubines, he still had an affair with Liu Wang, the wet nurse of his second son (also known as Liu Ma). One time, his male servant Zhang Shulin saw them. Liu Ma was afraid that Zhang would spread the word outside, so she also had an affair with Zhang Shulin. After the Liu Ma triangle affair occurred, the resentment between Wang and Zhang deepened. Later, Wang received several anonymous letters, which he suspected were written by Zhang Shulin. He then bribed the cook Li Liangjing and his brother-in-law Xi Cangyou to conspire to kill Zhang. At 8:00 PM on January 27, Wang sent Zhang to Li's place, telling him to come to the house because he had something to do. Li entered the courtyard, and when Zhang stepped onto the stairs, he fired a shot at his neck. Zhang was immediately shot down. Li then used a rope to strangle him to death. The next day, Li and Xi dismembered Zhang into eight pieces and packed them into two newly purchased purple and blue lacquered iron boxes. Four days later, they sent them to the Qianmen Railway Station. When the railway station asked for the key to inspect the boxes, Li, Xi, and Wang made excuses to get the key and fled. Later, Li Liangjing was arrested, and Wang Huayi fled to Nanjing. In November of that year, he went to Gansu and served as a counselor in the Sui Provincial Government Office. After the war broke out in 1937, he went to Jiaodong and served as the commander of the security forces. In 1940, he served as the captain of the first detachment of the 56th Army in western Henan. In 1943, he was captured by the Japanese army in Bian. After the victory, he was released. Last year, he served as the section chief of the Fourth Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. In September of this year, he was transferred to the Northeast Headquarters. When he passed through Beiping, he lived in Dongsi 7th Alley. Unexpectedly, he was arrested for drug use. After strict interrogation, it was learned that this Wang Zongyao was Wang Huayi, the main culprit in the Box Corpse Case of yesteryear. After the investigation of the Criminal Investigation Corps was completed, Wang was handed over to the police station this morning for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Editorial: The Resurgence of the British Conservative Party</p>
<p>Following the municipal elections in France, the national municipal elections in Britain were held a few days ago. According to reports, in the 385 of 392 municipal districts where election results are known, the Conservative Party won 631 seats, while the Labour Party lost 683 seats. Although this is not the final result of the British national municipal elections, the information already obtained makes it easy to see that the Conservative Party has achieved a decisive victory and has resurfaced. Although the British elections were municipal elections, they are sufficient to show that the British people have mostly turned to the Conservative Party. This is undoubtedly an important turning point for the future development of British politics and should be closely watched.</p>
<p>According to Labour Party Secretary-General Phillips, "Although the results of this election are disappointing, they are only a temporary setback." Conservative Party leader Churchill, however, believes that this is a manifestation of the national hatred for the Labour government, which is no longer supported by the people. Therefore, he called for a general election to determine the fate of the Labour government. These are all remarks made based on the interests of their respective parties. Standing in an objective position, we can see several points that should be noted in the results of the British municipal elections:</p>
<p>First, the Labour Party's defeat was unavoidable even in Birmingham, Manchester, and other industrial areas that have always been regarded as important strongholds of the Labour Party. Second, in the thirty-one cities controlled by the Labour Party, it has now failed and been replaced by the Conservative Party. Third, the number of voters in the British municipal elections was extremely enthusiastic, reportedly reaching 80 percent of the total number of voters. Fourth, the banner under which the British municipal elections were fought was not local, but national, that is, a challenge to the Attlee government; and the result was a disastrous defeat for the Labour government. These four points show that the British people have turned to the right, inclining towards the Conservative Party. This is just like the results of the French municipal elections, where the people are increasingly turning to the right. Regarding this trend, we believe that the following explanations can be offered: This is the most obvious and direct response to the revival of the communist international, which attempts to sweep across the entire Europe. The French people have clearly expressed their intentions to be incompatible with the Communist International in their municipal elections; coupled with the results of the British municipal elections, it further demonstrates the consistency of the will of the people in Western European democratic countries. This is a sign that the British people are tired of the Labour government. In the two years after the victory of the war, under the rule of the Labour Party, the lives of the British people were not only more difficult than during the war; but also because the Labour government emphasized nationalization policies and planned economies, the British people inevitably felt worried about the future of their nation. Although the Labour Party has adopted only moderate socialism, and there is not much obvious difference from the Conservative Party in foreign policy, the relationship with the United States is no longer as harmonious as it was when the Conservative Party was in power. And Britain lacks US dollars, and it must have a closer relationship with the United States. With these points, it does not seem unexpected that the British people have turned to the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>Although the ruling Labour Party suffered a disastrous defeat in the British municipal elections, it seems unlikely that it will immediately shake or even overturn the Labour government. However, the failure of the municipal elections has made the Labour government increasingly difficult. Although the Labour Party still holds an absolute majority in the British Parliament; even before the results of the municipal elections were announced, in the debate on gasoline rationing, under the roar of the lion of Conservative Party leader Churchill, the Attlee government only maintained its position with a majority of twenty-four votes. It can be seen that the Labour government's position in Parliament is becoming increasingly difficult. As a result of the municipal elections, the Attlee government will face a "serious crisis" in Parliament, which is inevitable.</p>
<p>But what we want to point out here is that the British Labour Party and Conservative Party are not essentially different. Although the Labour Party advocates moderate socialism, the Conservative Party also advocates planned economy. The Conservative Party is not conservative, and the Labour Party is not revolutionary. It is just that the Labour Party calls itself moderate socialists, and the Conservative Party's socio-economic policies are slightly more moderate than the Labour Party's. There is also no difference in foreign policy. Under the Labour government, we have not yet seen the return of Hong Kong. Therefore, the Labour Party and the Conservative Party seem to be no different in essence. However, the results of the British municipal elections make it even clearer that the British people are turning to the right, and even moderate socialism has failed. Following the French municipal elections, this is undoubtedly a concrete manifestation of the consistent will of the people in Western Europe and the best response to the Communist International.</p>
<p>War Creates Joys and Sorrows! Stories of Overseas Chinese (Part 1) Ninth Letter from Poland. Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing of This Newspaper</p>
<p>It was a clear summer morning. A cool breeze was blowing across the Vistula River. On my way back to the "Bristol" Hotel from the post office, I ran into three Chinese merchants with "yellow faces" by the river. From that day on, overseas Chinese living in Poland came to visit me at the "Bristol" Hotel one after another, and I heard many stories about the overseas Chinese in Poland. If we do not include women and family members who have already acquired Chinese nationality, there are only forty-seven overseas Chinese in the entire territory of Poland now. It is said that there were more people last year than this year, and more the year before than last year. The war is over, and the overseas Chinese are eager to go home, but some have gone to France, and because they ran out of travel expenses and the boat tickets are too expensive, they returned to Poland again.</p>
<p>Like in other countries in continental Europe, most of the overseas Chinese are from Qingtian, Zhejiang Province, the hometown of General Chen Cixiu. The people of Qingtian are "destined" for Europe. You can see the simple, frugal, diligent, and hardworking people of Qingtian everywhere you go. In 1945, near the Gare de Lyon in Paris, I asked them if they had heard the name of "General Chen Cheng." Many people shook their heads blankly, but this time in Warsaw, they all raised their thumbs and talked about Chen Cheng with every sentence. Several people insisted that they were classmates of General Chen when they were in elementary school.</p>
<p>I don't know if what they said is true or false. Anyway, these people have come to Poland from Qingtian, tens of thousands of miles away, and they all have their extraordinary "tricks." The Cantonese go overseas to America with "a shoulder of luggage," the people of Qingtian go overseas to Europe with "a shoulder of pebbles" (Qingtian gems). They travel from the three northeastern provinces through Siberia to Europe. The language is not understood, the customs are not understood, and the courage of Pangu, who created the world, is impossible to imagine. Zhan Zhiyuan, a leather merchant in Warsaw, told me that a member of their family has lived in Europe for generations. His father returned to China in his old age, earning several thousand US dollars and building houses and buying properties in his hometown. Then, after graduating from junior high school, he inherited his father's business and went overseas to Poland. Another factory owner, Zhuo Jinlan, has spent his entire life wandering. He wandered from Qingtian to Japan, can speak Japanese, and has also been to "Manzhouli" (meaning the Northeast), where he learned to speak "Mandarin." Later, he sneaked into Siberia and stayed in Moscow for many years, so he also learned to speak Russian. Zhuo Jinlan speaks Polish quite well now, but he says that he can only listen and speak, but cannot write. He can read the newspaper roughly, because phonetic text can be read with meaning if you just follow the pronunciation. He said: Many of the overseas Chinese who now live in Poland came from Moscow. "Since the Communist Party revolution in Russia, the overseas Chinese have no way to survive, so they fled to Poland one after another." However, he said very sadly: "Poland has now become the world of the Communist Party again"? Another long-faced overseas Chinese interjected: "Some people in China are actually doing communism now, which is really stupid to the extreme." He said: "Let them come here to have a look, the world of Communist robbers!" Afterwards, I realized the source of the overseas Chinese's complaints. It is said that the police of the Polish government have searched the homes of overseas Chinese many times. Are there any "smuggled goods" on which taxes have not been paid? Are there any other items that violate regulations? Therefore, the overseas Chinese are all worried, fearing that their years of hard-earned money will be lost due to internal strife. I asked them if Moscow was like this? An overseas Chinese told me: After the success of the Communist Revolution in Moscow, almost all the legitimate overseas Chinese merchants withdrew from Russia, with the exception of those who had relations with the Communist Party. They still live in Moscow today. The years after the Nazis occupied Poland in 1939 were dark days for the overseas Chinese. They were arrested and forced to work in concentration camps, working more than ten hours a day. It is said that German officers were quite fond of "Chinese workers" because they were "obedient" and never lazy. In early 1945, when Germany was defeated from Poland, Nazi officers told them: "Follow our army back to Berlin, otherwise, if the Russians invade, you will all be shot!" Many people wandered to Germany like this, and many people deserted when the Nazis retreated and are still living in Poland. August 1944 was the most tragic season in Warsaw. In July of that year, the Russian army swept across Lublin and approached Warsaw. The Polish government in exile in London, without obtaining the consent of the Polish government established in Moscow, launched an uprising in the capital on August 1. The original intention was to cooperate with the Russian army outside the city to restore Poland, but unexpectedly, the Russian army remained motionless, which caused the Nazis to massacre in Warsaw. The Polish people call this uprising the "AK Party Revolution." The AK Party Revolution destroyed all the buildings in Warsaw, destroyed hundreds of thousands of Polish lives, and implicated our innocent overseas Chinese. Two Qingtian merchants, Yin Caichi and Xu Xiangui, left China in 1929, "walking and walking again," and arrived in Poland in 1932. They did business in Poland and had a small savings. They originally planned to return to China in the winter of 1939, but unexpectedly, the Second European War broke out that year, and Poland was the first to suffer. They were tied up in concentration camps for several years.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the AK Party Revolution, Yin and Xu, as well as Yin Caichi's uncle Yin Zuoyu, moved to No. 59 Shehukalu in Yeisha City. An hour before the outbreak of the revolution, Yin Zuoyu went out shopping. As soon as the gunfire rang out, traffic in the city was cut off, and Yin Zuoyu could not return to his home. "A murder occurred out of thin air during this period."</p>

<h3>Kashmir Situation Tense; Civil War in India Like a Raging Fire; Threatens to Engulf the State of Hyderabad; Governor-General of Pakistan Orders the Organization of Volunteer National Guard</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 3rd] The civil war in Kashmir and Jammu &amp; Kashmir appears to threaten to engulf Hyderabad, India's largest princely state. Although the King of Hyderabad declared on August 15, the day India declared its independence, that the state did not intend to join India or Pakistan, internal unrest is brewing in this richest, most populous, and largest princely state. Muslims have been causing trouble from time to time in the past four days, fearing that the King of Hyderabad will announce the annexation of the Indian Dominion. If the unrest in Hyderabad cannot be contained, it will inevitably cause an explosive situation in the Indian princely states, plunging the entire Indian peninsula into terror. Negotiations between Hyderabad and the Indian Dominion continued today in New Delhi, but no communiqué was issued after the meeting.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 3rd] In the state of Junagadh on the Kathiawar Peninsula on the west coast of the Indian Peninsula, after the King of that state announced the annexation of the state to Pakistan, the Hindus of that state declared the establishment of a provisional government and organized a revolutionary army to advance on the capital. According to a telegram from Rajkot, on the border of Junagadh, the revolutionary army has occupied 25 villages in and around Dhrol, only ten miles from the capital, and is about to approach the capital.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] Indian-Muslim clashes occurred again in two cities in Hyderabad today. Six houses and a stack of firewood were set on fire, and several people were injured.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Karachi, 2nd] Amid the deteriorating relations between India and Pakistan, Governor-General of Pakistan Jinnah suddenly issued an order today allowing the organization of a National Guard to supplement Pakistan's regular army. The members of the National Guard are based on the principle of voluntary service and are subject to the command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army. This order takes effect immediately and applies to all territories of Pakistan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 2nd] Khunam, a prominent leader of the Palestinian Arabs, traveled from Lahore to Kashmir at the end of last month to participate in the holy war to liberate his Muslim brothers. (Note: Mr. Khunam participated in the Iraqi revolution during World War II. After the failure of the revolution, he fled to Turkey and was captured by the British army and imprisoned in the Northwest Frontier Province of India.) This time, he went to Kashmir at the invitation of Ibrahim, the leader of the provisional independent government of Kashmir, to organize an international corps.</p>
<h3>Nehru Asks Pakistan to Stop Armed Aggression Quickly; Advocates that the Fate of Kashmir be Determined by the People</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] Indian Dominion Prime Minister Nehru broadcast to the nation on the situation in Kashmir, stating that after peace and order are restored, India is prepared to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir under the supervision of international organizations such as the United Nations. Nehru then explained in detail the various events that led to the current situation in Kashmir, saying, "We have repeatedly asked the Pakistani government to stop the invasion of armed forces and withdraw those who have already invaded. Because there are very few roads into Kashmir, and many bridges, it should not be difficult to stop them. As soon as the danger of invasion has passed, the Indian government has no intention of using troops in Kashmir again."</p>
<p>Nehru continued, "We have consistently condemned any misconduct in the past, whether it was committed by Muslims, Hindus, or Sikhs. Therefore, if Hindu, Sikh, or Kashmiri officials have behaved improperly in Jammu Province, they should be condemned. However, the reports we have received detail that 95 villages in the province have been destroyed by invaders from Pakistan, and many towns have been robbed and destroyed. Most of the Poonch district of Kashmir has been occupied by the invaders. Does this not indicate that the Northwest Frontier Province and West Punjab are launching an organized act of aggression against Kashmir? The invading troops are well-equipped and well-led, and they are all from Pakistan. We have the right to question Pakistan, how did these people get into Pakistan to invade, and how were they able to transport these weapons? Is this not an act in violation of international law, or an unfriendly act towards a neighboring country?"</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] An Indian Army communiqué stated: The troops invading Kashmir from Pakistan have been stopped at the Pandan Mountains, twenty miles west of Srinagar. The Royal Indian Air Force is conducting offensive reconnaissance operations in the area. At the same time, according to Srinagar, since Abdullah took office as the head of the transitional government of Kashmir, an action has been launched in Srinagar to purge the fifth column, and several suspects have been arrested.</p>
<h3>Leader of Polish Peasant Party Flees to England</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 3rd] British Foreign Secretary Mayhew declared in the House of Commons today that Mikolajczyk, the leader of the Polish Peasant Party, has flown to Britain and requested asylum.</p>
<h3>New Communist International; US Communist Party Does Not Plan to Participate</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 2nd] US Communist Chairman Foster and Secretary-General Dennis issued a statement saying that the US Communist Party is willing to support the Information Bureau established by the Communist Parties of nine European countries, but has decided not to participate in the Bureau, because once the US Communist Party participates, it will inevitably invite new "oppression." The so-called "oppression" refers to President Truman's "loyalty order" and the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation of communist activities.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Celebrates October Revolution; Issues Forty Slogans</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 2nd] The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party has recently announced forty slogans to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Union, mostly urging the people to defend the motherland. All Soviet newspapers published the slogans in prominent positions on the front page. Some of the slogans instruct soldiers of the army and navy to improve their political knowledge, or order them to use the experience gained during the war to build the country's military strength. One of the slogans calls on workers in all countries to expose the masks of warmongers. As for laborers, especially workers in the coal, iron, railway, military, and chemical industries, they are urged to work hard to step up production and build the strength of the Soviet state. The Soviet government has stipulated November 7, 8, and 9 as holidays to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution, at which time the aforementioned forty slogans will be posted on all buildings across the country.</p>
<h3>Total Amount of US Foreign Aid Funds; Vandenberg Demands Disclosure; Harriman Advocates Extending Export Control Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press, Michigan, 3rd] Senate Chairman and Foreign Affairs Committee Director Vandenberg gave a speech at the University of Michigan on the 3rd, stating that Truman should propose the "total amount" of foreign aid, including China, in the upcoming special Congress. The United States must not provide unlimited assistance to foreign countries. It is believed that this indicates that the Foreign Affairs Committee will insist on making the Wedemeyer Report public. Most of Vandenberg's speech referred to the Soviet Union's policy in the United Nations. He said that if the United Nations cannot guarantee peace, then it must clearly designate who should be held responsible, and the Soviet Union is clearly paralyzing the work of the Security Council with its veto power. He also strongly condemned Vyshinsky's absurdity in accusing the United States of being a warmonger. He called on the United States to continue its efforts to strengthen the United Nations while doing its best to maintain the US national defense. He said: "Most of us" believe that the Soviet Union's policy is "incompatible with peace." Vandenberg concluded by saying: Britain, the United States, and France will do their best to seek the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany at the upcoming foreign ministers' conference. If the Soviet Union continues to oppose, the Western allies will sign a separate peace treaty with their occupied zones.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Secretary of Commerce Harriman suggested to President Truman tonight that the export control measures, which were originally scheduled to expire at the end of February next year, should be extended immediately in consideration of protecting the domestic economy and supporting foreign policy. It is said that export control can enable the United States to transport necessities to the most urgent countries, so that they can be used most effectively and accelerate the economic recovery of the world. Moreover, for the sake of promoting the Marshall Plan for European Recovery, export control is also necessary.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly May Put Aside Veto Power Issue of Five Great Powers; Soviet Union Rejects US Proposal on Holy Land Issue</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] New York Broadcasting on the 3rd: Lake Success News, today the Soviet Union rejected the US proposal on the partition of the Holy Land, but insisted that Britain should abandon its mandate over the Holy Land in January next year and withdraw all its troops by May next year at the latest.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 2nd] Reliable sources said today: The current session of the United Nations General Assembly will put aside the veto power issue of the five great powers and will not discuss it in order to declare a recess on the 25th of this month. Assembly President Aranha of Brazil has asked the fourteen-nation steering committee to meet tomorrow to discuss how to end the current session.</p>
<p>The General Assembly has only voted on one major issue in the seven weeks since the meeting opened. The proposal by US Secretary of State Marshall to establish a permanent "small assembly" and the issue of Korean independence are still being discussed in the political committee or its subgroups. It is learned that Tea (India) intends to suggest to the steering committee that the veto power issue and several other secondary issues be left to be raised after the end of the current session of the General Assembly or at the autumn meeting next year. If a "small assembly" is established, the veto power issue can be submitted for discussion.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 3rd] The United Nations General Assembly has entered its eighth week today. The two important cases proposed by US Secretary of State Marshall, the establishment of a "small assembly" and the granting of Korean independence, are about to end their debates and are expected to be put to a vote at the end of this week.</p>
<h3>India to Propose Amendments to Korean Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 2nd] It is reported that the Indian delegation will propose to the UN Political Committee that the elections in Korea should be held before February 15 under the supervision of a United Nations delegation with direct supervisory power. According to the US proposal, it should be before March 31, and the United Nations delegation is only of an advisory nature. India will suggest that all election details be handled by the US and Soviet occupying authorities under the guidance of the United Nations delegation. India will also suggest that the US and Soviet occupation forces should withdraw within ninety days after the establishment of the Korean government. Sources familiar with the matter say that the United States is unlikely to oppose India's suggestion that the United Nations Supervisory Committee have direct control over the elections, but it is unlikely to agree with the limited time for the withdrawal of the occupying forces. The United States believes that the establishment of Korean security forces should be required, and no precise date can be predetermined.</p>

<h3>Former Brazilian Ambassador to the Soviet Union Returns Home via Northern Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, March 3] Former Brazilian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Montele, along with four members of the embassy staff, boarded a plane today from Moscow to Helsinki, and then to Stockholm, en route to return home. This departure occurs exactly two weeks after the severing of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Conservative Party Wins City Elections; British Cabinet Unmoved, Resolved to Continue Socialization Policies</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, March 3] Despite the Conservative Party's overwhelming victory in the British city council elections, Prime Minister Attlee convened a cabinet meeting on the 3rd to discuss strengthening Britain's socialization program. A senior government official stated that regardless of whether a general election is held before 1950, the government will continue to nationalize gas, steel, and other industries. A veto from the House of Lords would only delay the process by a year. It is believed that the British Cabinet will not give much weight to the city council election defeats, as they will not directly affect Parliament or the government. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Conservative Party headquarters stated that the Conservatives may not formally demand the dissolution of the House of Commons and a special election, but Members of Parliament such as Churchill will likely raise this demand in Parliament. Currently, the Conservative Party and other anti-socialization parties have regained 42% of the 1,544 seats lost in the 1945 and 1946 city council elections. If this proportion is maintained in the next general election, the Conservative Party could recover 71 of the 170 seats lost in Parliament in 1945, but the Labour Party would still hold a majority. Authoritative sources state that although senior officials such as Attlee expected setbacks in these city council elections, the extent of the defeat was beyond expectations.</p>
<h3>Churchill Elated</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, March 3] Churchill, in a statement on the 2nd, declared that the victory of the Conservative Party and liberal-minded men and women over the incompetent and misguided forces that have led the country down a path of ruin is the best thing that has happened in Britain since the tragic election of 1945. The results of the city elections have deprived the Labour government of the mandate it obtained in the general election, and it will henceforth govern without moral support and in defiance of the will of the people.</p>
<h3>Gold from Britain and France Continues to Flow to the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, March 2] French officials in Washington revealed that France is estimated to have shipped gold worth $89.6 million to the United States on the 10,000-ton cruiser "Li Gees" in exchange for much-needed US dollars.

<h3>Over 80% of US Surplus Goods Sold; Lovett Submits Report to Congress</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, March 2] According to a report submitted to Congress by Acting Secretary of State Lovett, 82% of the surplus goods that the United States left overseas at the end of the war have been sold. In his covering letter, Lovett stated: "We should point out that the surplus goods that have not yet been sold in Europe and the rest of the world have no direct value for economic relief and reconstruction."</p>

<h3>Reviewing "The Tumultuous Decade"; Marshall Calls for Cooperation, Otherwise Constant Readiness for Action is Essential</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, March 3] In "The Tumultuous Decade" (from 1937 to 1946) written for the Encyclopedia Britannica, US Secretary of State Marshall implied that if another war were to occur, "destructive and decisive blows might be struck in the initial actions, leaving the defending nation no time to mobilize." He concluded that the nations of the world have only two choices: one is to "constantly maintain their highly prepared industries and armed forces"; the other is to develop some form of international mechanism to mutually guarantee against aggression.</p>
<h3>Total Number of Soldiers Killed in Action in World War II Reaches Fifteen Million</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chicago, March 3] Former US Chief of Staff General Marshall wrote a report for the Encyclopedia Britannica stating that a total of 57 countries participated in World War II, with a total of 15 million soldiers killed or missing, with the Soviet Union having the highest number of deaths. Marshall listed the number of soldiers killed or missing from each country as follows: United States: 295,904; United Kingdom: 305,770; British Commonwealth: 452,570; Soviet Union: 7,500,000; France: 200,000; Germany: 2,850,000; Italy: 300,000; China: 2,200,000; Japan: 1,506,000 (starting from 1937). Marshall also stated that small countries, especially Poland and Southeast European countries, suffered losses of hundreds of thousands of people. The total cost of World War II may never be revealed, and all data "are only partial and inadequate calculations." For example, the number of civilian deaths and injuries is fundamentally difficult to calculate.</p>
<h3>Koishiso's Testimony Implicates Miao Bin</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, March 3] Former Japanese Prime Minister Koiso Kuniaki testified in the International Military Tribunal on the 3rd that he had suggested to the Soviet Union in early 1945 that Japan send a special envoy to Moscow to discuss preparations for peace with Britain and the United States, but this was repeatedly rejected by the Soviet Union. Koiso also stated that in February 1945, Miao Bin, a puppet of the Wang Jingwei regime, visited Japan. The Japanese government intended to use Miao Bin to establish contact with the Nationalist government in Chongqing to conduct a "peace movement." Miao Bin was a "mysterious figure" who carried peace proposals from Chongqing to Japan, consisting of six points, including China and Japan signing a separate armistice agreement, the Japanese army completely withdrawing from China, Nanjing being under a long-term Japanese detention, and the establishment of a transitional government in Nanjing aligned with Chongqing to help mediate peace between Britain, the United States, and Japan.</p>
<h3>Yuki Toyotaro Becomes a Monk</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, March 3] Yuki Toyotaro, a prominent figure in Japanese financial circles for the past twenty years who served as Minister of Finance and President of the Bank of Japan, is now seventy years old and has entered Yuki Shrine in Tsu City, near the Ise Grand Shrine in southwestern Honshu, as a Shinto priest.</p>
<h3>The Philippines Again Promulgates Harsh Laws, Making it Difficult for Foreign Nationals to Leave the Country</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, March 3] The Philippine Immigration Bureau has recently promulgated new regulations regarding the departure of foreign nationals, ordering them to hold a port clearance pass upon departure. This pass must be applied for in person, requiring the applicant to fill out an application form, affix fingerprints, and present documents proving that they do not owe the government any money and are not involved in any pending lawsuits. However, diplomats and their families, foreign naval personnel, foreign seamen under the age of fourteen, foreigners passing through, and foreigners staying in the Philippines for tourism for less than two weeks are exempt. These new regulations are unlawful in nature, as they assume that every departing foreign national is guilty of evading taxes or other accusations if they cannot produce the required documents.</p>
<h3>Bao Dai's Wife Arrives in Marseille</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, March 2] The former Queen Nam Phuong, wife of Annamese King Bao Dai, arrived in Marseille by plane from Saigon with her five children.

<h3>Katayama Tets Officially Demands Resignation of Japanese Agriculture Minister</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, March 3] Prime Minister Katayama met with Agriculture Minister Hirano at 6:00 PM on the 3rd, criticizing his recent words and actions as contrary to government policy and demanding his resignation. Justice Minister Suzuki, after meeting with Katayama, stated that the Hirano issue was due to his words and actions undermining cabinet unity. The so-called purge and accusations are secondary matters, which will also be investigated.</p>
<p>Speaker of the House of Representatives Matsuoka, during his visit to Katayama at 3:00 PM, also stated that Hirano's actions undermined cabinet unity, so he demanded his voluntary resignation, otherwise he would exercise the Prime Minister's power to dismiss him.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, March 3] Since being expelled from the Japan Farmers' Union Congress held in February of this year, Hirano has been directing right-wing Diet members of the Japan Farmers' Union, organizing the National Farmers' Union Diet Members Group, whose central force is composed of the old Japan Farmers' Union faction, a portion of the Social Democratic faction, the Matsuoka faction of the General Federation of Labor, and some young Diet members who support the anti-communist front.</p>
<h3>Katayama Calls for Peace</h3>

Katayama concluded by pointing out that the new Japanese Constitution clearly states the abandonment of war and the pursuit of lasting peace, and that Japan's future construction will be based on this.</p>

<h3>Public Trial of Tax Officials' Embezzlement Case; Defendants Testify About Negotiations in Restaurants, Deny Accepting Bribes But Admit to Receiving Two Checks</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Eleven officials from the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau, including auditors Gao Shijie, Xie Lianxun, Yu Maojie, Zhang Baoping, Yang Renzheng, Zou Wenlong, Liu Runxian, Zhang Wenhua, Wang Zonghuai, Wang Rentang, and Miao Boyan, were investigating the account books of seven Chinese-style furniture stores (Zhang Senmao, Zhu Genji, Wufu, Yang Longxing, Zhang Wanli, Zhang Wantai, and Qiao Yuantai) on August 15th of this year when they allegedly extorted a large sum of money. The case was uncovered, and the Tax Bureau handed over Gao, Xie, Yu, Zhang, Yang, and Zou to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and detention. Liu Runxian, Zhang Wenhua, Wang Zonghuai, and Wang Rentang fled upon hearing the news and are wanted. After completing the investigation, the District Prosecutor's Office believed that the defendants were suspected of corruption and filed a public prosecution on October 9th. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Judge Hu Zhichao and Clerk Dai Duchen of the Third Criminal Court of the District Court began the trial. Eight lawyers appeared in court to defend the defendants. Zhang Shouqi, Zhu Jianni, Cao Caigeng, Zhang Xianliang, Yang Yinshi, Zhang Zhonghui, Wang Yongxiang, and Shen Wenbin, as well as witnesses Zhao Xinggeng and Jing Heng, were summoned to court. Zhang Zhongyuan and Zheng Gongda did not attend. First, Attorney Chu Shun, representing Zhang Zhongyuan, described the events in detail. Then, each defendant, witness, and respondent was ordered to appear in court for individual questioning. The defendants uniformly denied soliciting bribes, claiming that the accounts were inconsistent and could not be reported, so they negotiated at the Jingdong Restaurant. According to Zou Wenlong (Tax Bureau Supervisor), "On August 17th, auditors Zhang Baoping and Yu Maojie had a slight argument with Zhang Xianliang, the manager of Zhang Senmao, while auditing the Zhang Senmao accounts. I intervened to mediate, and everyone dispersed. After returning to the bureau, Zheng Gongda called and invited me to dinner at the Jinghua Restaurant at 5:00 PM. When I arrived, some people from the furniture industry were there, saying that they were willing to pay to settle the matter and asked us to help. We refused. After I returned home, Zheng Gongda called me and said that he had put two checks in my coat pocket, one for three million yuan and one for fifty million yuan, totaling fifty-three million yuan. When I checked, there were indeed two checks. I wanted to return them immediately, but I couldn't find Zheng several times. It wasn't safe to keep the money on me, so I deposited the checks in the Chengdu Commercial Bank and returned them to him on the 23rd." Miao Boyan, who was sent by the Tax Bureau to investigate the case, stated, "On the 23rd, I was ordered by the director to investigate and asked each furniture store to sign a guarantee that there were no corrupt practices. All the stores complied, except for Zhang Wanli, because the owner Zhang Zhongyuan was not there, so they did not sign. I don't know about any bribery." Zhang Zhonghui, Wang Yongxiang, and Zhu Jianni testified that seven Direct Tax Bureau officials, including Zou Wenlong and Yu Maojie, were present at the dinner that day, and Zhu paid for the meal. However, another witness, Zhao Xinggeng, stated that he went to see a movie with Yu that afternoon, so Yu could not have been elsewhere. It was already 1:30 PM, and the court adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Director Discusses Four Methods for Raising Funds for the Winter Relief Society; Charity Horse Races Expected to be Approved; Entertainment Ticket Surcharge to be Implemented from Mid-Month</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The methods for raising relief funds for the Winter Relief Committee, as resolved by the Municipal Council, are to add a 20% entertainment tax, report to the central government for approval, hold charity horse races, organize charity soccer matches, and launch a fundraising campaign from all sectors. Social Bureau Director Wu Kaixian stated yesterday that the central government may approve the holding of charity horse races. He will contact the Jockey Club after Mayor Wu returns to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The surcharge of 20% for winter relief on entertainment ticket prices has been set to be implemented from the 15th of this month for a period of four months. All Peking opera, movie, drama, local opera, and dance hall ticket prices in the city will be subject to the surcharge. This period includes both the old and new Lunar New Years, and it is estimated that approximately 4 billion yuan can be collected each month. Peking opera theaters previously believed that the surcharge would affect their business due to high operating costs. Wu stated that this 20% entertainment tax is collected on behalf of the government, added to the ticket price, and not included in it. The money comes from the audience and has nothing to do with the theaters. As long as the actors have star power, it will not affect business.</p>
<p>The municipal government has temporarily allocated 10 billion yuan from the 60 billion yuan budget of the Winter Relief Society, and fundraising is underway. However, the weather is getting colder, so the municipal government yesterday first temporarily allocated 10 billion yuan for immediate use. The society has decided to first repair the shelter in Caohejing and prioritize accommodating elderly and vulnerable refugees starting from the 16th of this month. The shelter site at the Japan Textile Mill in Pudong is currently being negotiated with the China Textile Corporation. The police department will take over the Sheng Sheng Ranch in Xujiahui, where the mounted patrol team raises horses, to use as a shelter site. In Zhabei and other areas, it is planned to make maximum use of temples and other public places to accommodate refugees. The society will also soon put out a tender for the first batch of 5,000 cotton quilts to distribute to refugees for warmth.</p>
<p>Wu, the Director of the Social Bureau, added that the society is seeking to make relief efforts constructive, and is currently in contact with the Bureau of Public Works and the Bureau of Health to implement work-for-relief programs, with refugees undertaking tasks such as dredging rivers, repairing roads and bridges, and clearing garbage. Shelters will be built near the work sites to accommodate the refugees.</p>

<h3>Partial Rickshaw Strike Quickly Settled; Bureau of Social Affairs to Convene Labor and Management Today to Exchange Views and Discuss Issues Such as Rickshaw Rental Fees</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The rickshaw pullers' partial strike over rickshaw rental fees on the morning before yesterday has been settled after persuasion from all parties. The Bureau of Social Affairs, based on the report from the Rickshaw Industry Labor Union, stated that the strike was caused by Dai Biyiao, a rickshaw owner at 38 Tangjia Alley, Xiaonanmen, increasing rental fees. Dai Biyiao owns a total of 19 rickshaws and 11 modified single-person tricycles. The rickshaw rental fee is 30,000 yuan per day, and the modified single-person tricycle rental fee is 52,000 yuan per day. On the morning of the 2nd, Dai attempted to increase rental fees, causing 19 rickshaw pullers to collude with rickshaw pullers from seven other companies to stage a partial strike. They blocked rickshaws and tricycles along the way, deflating tires and stopping business. After the unrest occurred, the union sent personnel to persuade them, and the situation did not escalate. In the afternoon, the unrest spread to Caojiadu and Jiangjiaqiao in western Shanghai, where personnel were also sent to stop it. After receiving the report, the Bureau of Social Affairs has scheduled to convene Dai Biyiao and the rickshaw pullers who were on duty that day for questioning in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Organization of a Rickshaw Rental Fee Review Committee</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that the main cause of the recent unrest lies in the unresolved issue of rickshaw rental fees, the Bureau of Social Affairs has specifically scheduled a meeting at 2:00 PM today to convene the Rickshaw Owners Association and the Labor Union's directors and supervisors to exchange views and discuss issues such as rickshaw rental fees and rickshaw pullers' mutual aid associations. Huang Changhan, Section Chief of the Welfare Division of the Labor Department of the Bureau, told reporters that the Bureau of Social Affairs, in order to fundamentally resolve rickshaw rental fee disputes, suggested that the municipal government organize a rickshaw rental fee review committee consisting of nine units, including the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau of Public Utilities, the Police Bureau, the General Labor Union, the Municipal Headquarters of the Kuomintang, and representatives from both labor and management. The municipal government has approved the organization, and the Bureau of Social Affairs has submitted the organizational regulations for approval.</p>

Initially, it will be implemented in the suburbs first.</p>
<h3>Government Appoints Chen Aishi to Lead Public Memorial Ceremony</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The 36th Anniversary Commemoration of the Shanghai Commercial Corps' Restoration during the 1911 Revolution was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the fire station in the Hunan District of Nanshi. The association's location is where the commercial corps launched the uprising at 3:00 AM on November 3rd of the lunar calendar (September 13th), which is of profound significance. The huge clock tower in front of the building was used to sound the uprising signal with nine loud rings followed by thirteen rings. The clock tower was sounded thirteen times before the meeting as a commemoration.</p>
<p>White-Haired and Leaning on Canes</p>
<p>Inside and outside the meeting place, everyone stood in respectful silence, listening to the long-lost chimes, the first echoes of victory. Inside the hall, incense and candles burned, enshrining the spirits of the martyrs Chen Yinghsi, Zhang Lude, Yu Zhiwei, and eighteen others. The walls were covered with revolutionary documents and photographs from before and after the restoration. The hundred-odd attendees carefully examined the displays, sighing with emotion. They were all former patriots who personally participated in the attack on the Jiangnan Arsenal, and now, mostly white-haired and leaning on canes, they were deeply moved by the sight of these relics.</p>
<p>Surviving the Vicissitudes of the World, Still Standing Proudly</p>
<p>After the music played and the meeting began, National Government Commissioner Chen Aishi led the public memorial ceremony and presented flowers to the martyrs' memorial tablets. Zhu Shaoyi, the commander-in-chief of the Commercial Corps during the attack on the Jiangnan Arsenal, then gave a speech, reporting in detail the events of the uprising. Mao Jingji, director of the Hunan District fire station, also reported on the fire station's response to the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, stating that the fire station and its clock tower are extremely glorious memorials in the history of the Republic of China. He added that it was especially gratifying that the station has survived the vicissitudes of the world and is still standing proudly today. Subsequently, Municipal Government Secretary-General Shen Zonglian gave a speech stating that he was only twelve years old at the time of the Shanghai Restoration and was attending elementary school. He often saw the Taoist government office on fire at night and was extremely excited. The next day, he cut off his queue. Although 36 years have passed, the scene is still vivid in his mind. Today, seeing the veterans who led the uprising still healthy and vigorous, his excitement is no less than it was back then.</p>

<h3>U.S. Expert Dr. Conway Completes Transportation Improvement Report: Suggests Opening Roads to Reduce Vehicle Density, Adding Buses to Strengthen Transportation Capacity</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The municipal government, in order to improve traffic in the central district, previously hired a team of three American experts led by Dr. Conway. They came to Shanghai in March of this year for on-site inspections. Two months later, they returned to Philadelphia, USA, and completed an improvement report. Hu Huiquan, the department head dispatched by the Public Utilities Bureau to accompany them abroad, has returned to China and submitted it to the municipal authorities. Yesterday, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau told reporters that the report contained very concrete and valuable suggestions, but some may not be suitable for the local conditions of the city and will need to be revised. The Public Utilities Bureau will work with the Police Bureau, Public Works Bureau, and other relevant departments to study and implement the plan in phases. The full report is eighty pages long, and the main points are as follows:</p>
<h3>Insufficient Number of Public Vehicles</h3>
<p>Regarding the analysis of current traffic congestion, based on the operations of the British and French companies in the city, a comparison between 1946 and 1936 shows that the number of passengers carried in 1946 exceeded that of 1936 by 40% to 160%, while the number of kilometers driven decreased by about 30%. Congestion is therefore unavoidable. Although the city-run buses have shown efforts to develop, they are limited by vehicle equipment. Furthermore, the vehicles of the pre-war British Bus Company, the Chinese Zhabei Bus Company, and the Nanshi Tram Company no longer exist. The total passenger capacity of these three units after the war increased by 34% compared to pre-war levels, while the number of vehicles in operation decreased by 18%. At the same time, the number of pedicabs and rickshaws increased from 10,818 in 1936 to 31,252, an increase of 189%. The insufficient number of public vehicles, which led to an increase in other vehicles, is one of the main causes of congestion.</p>
<h3>Noteworthy "Free Ways"</h3>
<p>Modern experts believe that using vehicles with excellent performance, strengthening traffic control, and increasing driving speed to increase transport capacity is the most economical way to do so. Although the construction of underground passages is another excellent solution to traffic, it is extremely expensive (recent estimates at the Philadelphia municipal exhibition put the value of underground passages at US$16 million per mile). Elevated roads are less expensive, but have a negative impact on urban development, as evidenced by the New York City government's purchase and demolition of the elevated road on Sixth Avenue. It should be noted that if traffic in the city can be actively improved, there will be no need for underground passages or elevated roads. The maximum one-way transport capacity of the busiest roads in the central district, such as Nanjing Road, Waibaidu Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, and East Zhongzheng Road, has been measured at 5,000 to 8,000 people per hour. However, buses and trams, if equipped with excellent vehicles and effective traffic control, can achieve a one-way transport capacity of over 9,000 to 12,000 people per hour. Another important development in modern urban transport is the "Free Way", which is constructed like a highway between urban areas. It allows for rapid driving without passing through busy central areas. This potential development is most noteworthy for Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Improvement Plan Divided into Two Major Parts</h3>
<p>The improvement plan includes two major parts: (A) Municipal Section: Improve the quality and treatment of traffic police, strictly enforce traffic control regulations, promote traffic safety to the public, improve traffic signals, separate fast and slow vehicles, and even when using the same road, lanes should be demarcated, phased elimination of bottleneck-shaped buildings, and other long-term plans: opening roads through the former racetrack site to connect Fuzhou Road and Weihaiwei Road, opening Dalu Road in Zhabei to connect Yangshupu and Hongkou districts, and from Changshou Road and its vicinity, after crossing the Suzhou River, vehicles in the northern district can directly reach the western and southwestern districts through this road, reducing vehicle density in the central district. (B) Public Transport Section: Add vehicles; the first phase plan is to find ways to add 300 new or public buses, and the second phase is to improve trams and trolleybuses.</p>
<p>In his report, Dr. Conway specifically pointed out that in the development process of modern cities, traffic in the commercial center must be properly handled. The inevitable trend for those who fail to take timely measures is traffic congestion, inconvenient travel, commercial relocation, commercial decline in the central district, property depreciation, and reduced tax revenue. The city is now facing this stage and should work together to resolve it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Smiling and Stroking His Beard, Applauding in Response</p>
<p>The veteran comrades in the room, listening attentively to Shen's kind recollection, smiled and stroked their beards, applauding in response. Following reports by Chen Yishi and representatives from the Kuomintang municipal party headquarters, the meeting was adjourned for a photograph. It is said that the comrades of the Chamber of Commerce Uprising are all over fifty years old, with the oldest nearing eighty, so a dinner was held last night as a celebration. At the same time, Yuan Changkui and others jointly broadcasted the ringing of the bell and the opening of the meeting to commemorate this historic day of glory for the city.</p>
<h3>Preferential Fares for Soldiers Begin Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The preferential fare policy for soldiers on the two railway bureaus will be implemented starting tomorrow. Chen Shuxi, the director of the North Station of the bureau, visited military police and constitutional officers at the stations along the railway line to seek assistance. Director Chen returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon and said that all preparations have been completed, and disputes caused by soldiers riding without tickets should no longer occur.</p>

<p>[Our Report] The Japanese returned ship "Heshuen" arrived at Wusongkou outside the port at 4 pm yesterday. It is scheduled to dock at the 22nd pontoon of Guangxin Wharf in Yangshupu at 8 am this morning. The Shanghai Office of the Mission to Japan and the Maritime Affairs Bureau will jointly take delivery.</p>
<h3>Municipal Land Tax Collection to Begin Mid-Month</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Food approved a reduction of the land tax in Shanghai to 2.16 dou per mu (calculated as 1.2 dou actual, 0.6 dou borrowed, and 0.36 dou for public grain), the Finance Bureau has now scheduled the collection to begin on the 15th. The price standard is determined to be 198,000 yuan per stone.</p>
<h3>Oil Rationing by Population to Be Implemented, Purchase Certificates to Be Issued in Ten Days</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Civil Food Allocation Committee is actively handling the issue of oil rationing by population, which will begin this month, with one jin for large households and half a jin for small households. Purchase certificates are being printed and will be issued in ten days. The selling price will be determined by negotiation, equivalent to negotiation before the certificate is issued.</p>
<h3>Military Service Association Urges Payment of Preferential Funds</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The expenses incurred by the Military Service Association for the settlement allowance and consolation items issued to the volunteers were borrowed from various banks and bureaus, and must be repaid by the middle of this month. However, the preferential funds raised by the association have not been paid by many sectors. The association has reissued a notice urging each fundraising committee member to be responsible for raising 100 million yuan and paying it in advance.</p>
<h3>Holding Victory Bonds to Claim Money: Discovered to Be Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yang Chengyi, the manager of the Nanjing branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Bank, had 5,000 yuan worth of Allied Victory Public Bonds stolen by a pickpocket on Beijing Road last New Year's Eve. Afterwards, Yang reported to the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, requesting that a notice be issued nationwide to invalidate the payment. He also published advertisements in major newspapers, offering a reward of 500 US dollars to anyone who found and returned the bonds. At about 3 pm yesterday, a man named Pan Xiaoqi (residing at No. 23, Xinping Lane, Longmen Road) brought the bonds to the National Treasury Bureau to exchange them for legal tender. He was detained and handed over to the Songshan Police Station. He claimed that he found the bonds at the intersection of Beijing Road and Dianchi Road last year, and had already received US$416 for the first installment in April. The matter is now under detailed investigation to determine whether the bonds were found or stolen, so as to handle the matter accordingly.</p>

<h3>Lieutenant General Feng Yan Passes Away in Shanghai Due to Illness: Minister Bai Dispatches Personnel to Preside Over Funeral Affairs</h3>
<p>Lieutenant General Feng Yan, Director of the Land and Construction Department of the Ministry of National Defense, whose style name was Bu Fan, went to Linhai, Zhejiang last month on the 23rd on behalf of Minister Bai on official business. On the 24th, he arrived in Shanghai from Beijing and took the North Jiangsu ship to Linhai. He changed to a shoulder-carried sedan chair to go to the countryside. Because urgent official business needed to be handled in Beijing, he did not stay long in Linhai He Duo and took a small train to Haimen. That day, the wind and waves in the sea were extremely strong, and the ship was excessively turbulent. Feng vomited continuously for two days and one night on the ship, resulting in severe stomach bleeding. After arriving in Haimen, he was unable to receive medical treatment and took the Jiangjing ship to Shanghai, arriving at dawn on the 30th. He was admitted to the Sino-Western Sanatorium on Pushi Road for treatment, but ultimately died at 5:25 am on the 3rd due to excessive stomach bleeding. He was a graduate of the 13th class of the Army University and the first class of the National Defense Research Institute. He served as the Director of the First Department of the Military Order Department, the Chief of Staff of the 71st Army, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Expeditionary Force Headquarters, the Chief Liaison Staff Officer of the Military Commission stationed at the Allied Headquarters in Southeast Asia, the Representative of the Southeast Theater of Operations for Receiving Surrender, and the Deputy Director of the Minister's Office of the Ministry of National Defense, and Director of the Land and Construction Department. He was 39 years old and a native of Nantong. He joined the army early and had many achievements, especially during the Anti-Japanese War. His untimely death is a great loss to the nation, and everyone regrets it. His dependents have come to Shanghai from both Beijing and Nantong. His friends in Shanghai, Yang Xiaotian, Feng Zhongda, Zhu Shenwei, and Ge Futian, are helping to handle the funeral arrangements on his behalf. Minister Bai has specially dispatched Director Zhang of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of National Defense to fly to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday afternoon to preside over the funeral affairs.</p>
<h3>Shipping Association Responsible Person Speaks Out Against Opening of Navigation Rights on the Beijing-Hankou Line</h3>

The person in charge of the Shipping Association spoke out against this yesterday.</p>
<h3>A Blind Man's Ambiguous Case: Both Man and Woman Groped Their Way to Court</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The District Prosecutor's Office seemed to be hearing a case of rape by a blind man yesterday. The plaintiff is Chen Afa, a businessman from Wuxian, who lives at No. 243, Dongsiwen Lane, Datong Road. His daughter, Huiqin, is 19 years old, blind, and studies fortune-telling. She was allegedly raped by her fellow apprentice, the blind man Zhu Haiqiao. According to Chen Afa's complaint, Zhu, 32, lives at No. 90, A-shaped, Dongzhuanbang, Jiangsu Road. He makes a living by fortune-telling. Under the pretext of illness, he asked his fellow apprentice Huiqin to help with fortune-telling at his house. He then used sweet words and various inducements, but to no avail. He then resorted to coercion and raped her on the fourth day of the third month of the lunar calendar. He then raped her twice more. Huiqin repeatedly negotiated with Zhu, requesting a settlement, but Zhu, having achieved his goal, ignored her. Out of shame and indignation, Huiqin swallowed Lai Sha at the Railway Hotel at No. 85, Tianmu Road on the afternoon of October 16th and committed suicide. Fortunately, she was discovered early and sent to the Shanghai Sanatorium for emergency treatment, and her life was saved. The North Station Police Station has taken the case. Yesterday, Prosecutor Huang Daping summoned both the man and the woman. The two blind people groped their way to court. Chen Huiqin said: "Zhu used sweet words to deceive me, saying that his wife was not a proper wife, and wanted to marry me. I was softened by these words." Zhu denied the rape, saying that Chen wanted to come to my house to help, but I didn't agree because she was young and prone to accidents. As for Chen accusing me of rape, I really don't know why.</p>
<h3>Stableman Loses Job and Secret Opium Den Finally Busted</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Xincheng Police Station received a tip-off a few days ago and apprehended two men and women publicly smoking opium in a makeshift shelter beside Shanjia Garden Road, Fengyang Road.

The culprit, named Yang Mugen, nicknamed "Blind Mugen," used to be a stableman at the Race Club. After losing his job, he became a rogue and secretly sold opium. In less than a year, he accumulated a considerable fortune, with wives and concubines living together at No. 12, Lane 31, Xinchang Road. The furnishings in his home were extremely luxurious. When Chief Hao of the police station, along with officers Weng Yongquan, Zhao Yongji, Zhao Zigian, and others, went to arrest him, Yang had already escaped with his wives and concubines after hearing the news. Only a maid, Qin Aimei, was apprehended, and 115 small packets of heroin were found in a lead box at the back door.</p>

The waiter repeatedly asked for payment to no avail. At about 1 pm yesterday, they were evicted, causing them to hold a grudge. They placed a cigarette butt in the cotton wadding. The tea boy, Yu Fengqi, discovered the wadding was smoking while tidying the bedding. He quickly put out the fire with water and chased after them. He turned Sun and the others over to the police in front of the Changzhou Inn across the street.

<h3>Injustice Cleared, Dreams Come True: A Record of the Murder and Body Disposal Case in Fuzhou, the Culprit Captured</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our Fuzhou Correspondent, 1st] A shocking case of murder for money and body disposal occurred recently at No. 2, Duan Sanying, Daoshan Road, causing a sensation throughout Fuzhou, with onlookers thronging the area. The full story is as follows: Zheng Qingjing, 32 years old, from Xianyou County, graduated from the high school department of Fujian College and is currently the chairman of the Bantou Township Chamber of Commerce in Xianyou County. He usually trades between Fujian and Taiwan. This spring, he and his sworn friend, someone, jointly operated a Southeast Company in Taipei, with Zheng as the manager. The business situation was not bad. Zheng has an elderly mother and a brother at home, and is married to Lin Ruiying, with whom he has five children. His wife usually lives with Zheng in Taiwan.</p>
<p>In September of this year, his wife returned to her hometown in Xianyou because she was pregnant and nearing her due date. Zheng said that he would also return to Fujian at the end of September. His wife returned to Xianyou for about a month, and on September 30th, she received a telegram from her husband from Taiwan, saying: I will take a plane from Taiwan to Fuzhou on October 1st, stay in Fuzhou for three days, and then transfer to Xianyou. Zheng did arrive in Fuzhou on that day and first stayed at the Jiangbin Hotel on Jiangbin Road. The next morning, he entered the city and visited his friend Wu Chao and Zhang Liangdong at No. 2, Duan Sanying, Daoshan Road. Wu had previously owed Zheng a sum of money in Taiwan, and Zheng came here partly to collect the debt. During the conversation, Wu and Zhang learned that Zheng had brought more than 30 million yuan in cash and checks with him, which aroused Wu and Zhang's murderous intentions. Wu feigned goodwill and dealt with him superficially, while the two plotted to poison Zheng. On the evening of October 3rd, the third day of Zheng's return to Fuzhou, Wu and Zhang invited Zheng to their home for drinks and entertainment. While Zheng was unaware, they strangled him to death and sank the body under the floor of the room. Two days later, the murderers falsely claimed to the landlord that they were returning to their hometown to visit relatives and fled far away in the middle of the night with their luggage. The landlord initially did not know why. Since his wife received the cable on October 1 from her husband, she waited eagerly everyday.</p>
<p>Looking eagerly.</p>
<p>She said that she had a bad dream on the 26th of last month, in which she saw her husband standing in front of her bed, telling her in detail how he was killed, and asking her to come to Fuzhou to excavate the body and avenge him on an auspicious day. The next morning, the deceased's wife immediately came to Fuzhou and inquired about everything with the landlord and the deceased's friend Lin Yuansheng. Later, she opened the empty room where the murderer lived. It is said that at this time, she suddenly felt dizzy and saw someone pointing to the old floor, which was nailed with new iron nails. So she yelled madly</p>
<p>Open the floor.</p>
<p>At this time, a police officer happened to pass by and heard someone shouting madly in the room. He rushed in to see what was going on and saw more than a dozen people gathered around. After inquiring about the details, he reported to the branch bureau and hired workers to excavate. After digging about four feet, they found a corpse, which was Zheng Qingjing himself. After the police station notified the District Prosecutor's Office to send a forensic doctor to examine the body, the provincial government, considering the seriousness of the case, ordered that the murderers Wu Chao and Zhang Liangdong be arrested in Xianyou County on the 1st and are now preparing to send them to the province for investigation. The course of this case is like a legend of the Tang and Song dynasties. The section on the deceased's wife "dreams come true" is particularly bizarre and strange. It is recorded as above.

<h3>Refugees in Jinshan Seize Vegetables and Straw by Force</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our Jinshan Correspondent, 1st] On the 29th of last month, more than 100 refugees from Fengxian suddenly arrived at Zhangyan Township East City, in the county.

However, after receiving the money, the refugees forcibly seized people's vegetables and straw within the first ward and demanded a supply of chickens and ducks. After the local ward police reported the incident, a team was dispatched to suppress it, and the refugees left for Zhejiang Province on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Coal Enters White Market from Black Market: Coal Producers Feel Greatly Threatened</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our Hebei Correspondent, 2nd] Liu Ming, chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Coal Industry Association, and Yan Qingxian, a coal industry tycoon, told reporters: "Taiwan coal is encountering the difficulty of 'entering the white market from the black market.' The equipment needed in the coal mining areas must be purchased from the black market at high prices, but the coal must be sold at the officially set price of 5,500 Taiwan dollars per ton, which poses a great threat to coal producers." In the past, the Japanese achieved a maximum annual output of 300,000 tons on Taiwan, where the coal seams are very thin. At the time of the recovery, it was only 15,000 tons. In the previous two months, it increased to 70,000 tons, of which 40,000 tons were shipped to Beijing and Shanghai. With the weather in the mainland gradually getting colder recently, Liu Ming said: "In order to fully express our love for the country and our compatriots, we have decided to increase production to 100,000 tons starting this month, of which 70,000 tons can be supplied to Beijing and Shanghai," and a meeting will be held on the 5th to discuss the matter. His only wish is that the government will establish policies to encourage increased production and assist in the operation of coal mines (77 mine pits have already received small subsidies) and adjust official prices.</p>

<h3>Cave-In in Zhengzhou South City Kills Eight Refugees</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our Zhengzhou Correspondent, October 29th] There are no fewer than 50,000 to 60,000 refugees gathered in Zhengzhou. Among them, more than 4,000 refugees have no houses to live in and mostly live in air-raid shelters along the city. Unfortunately, two caves in the south city collapsed at 7 am on the 28th. County Magistrate Gao Qinglun personally led self-defense team soldiers to rescue them after hearing the news. A total of six corpses from the Zhang Senlin family and two corpses from the Li Junchuan family were dug out. One member of the Zhang family and two members of the Li family were seriously injured and sent to the hospital for treatment. According to the Li family, they lived in the refugee shelter of the Executive Yuan, but because they heard that the Executive Yuan was about to close and take back the tents they lived in, they first occupied the city cave, but unexpectedly encountered this tragedy.</p>

<h3>The Henan Province Competes to Plant Tobacco, and the Price of Tobacco Fields Skyrockets</h3>
<p>"Our newspaper's Zhengzhou 31st dispatch" The tobacco leaves produced in Xuchang, Xiangxian, and Jiaxian areas of Henan are the most famous. Recently, almost all counties, large and small, are planting tobacco. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has established experimental farms in Xuchang and other places, and at the same time distributed American seeds to encourage farmers to cultivate them. Currently, one mu of tobacco field is unwilling to be sold even for 20 million yuan. It is said that the income from one mu of tobacco field is as high as 10 to 20 million yuan. As a result of everyone competing to plant tobacco, the price of grain in Henan has increased day by day (of course, there are other reasons). Farmers are now murmuring about planting tobacco, believing that if this continues, although those who deal in tobacco will get rich and live extravagantly for the time being, if there is no overall plan for grain in the province in the end, then tobacco leaves may become foxtail millet leaves, and everyone will rise up to level them. Farmers certainly know that these tobacco leaves can block part of the outflow of foreign exchange, but they still feel that it is important for them to have enough to eat.</p>
<p>"Another dispatch" Fresh dates have recently appeared on the market here, as large as green plums, with a color like coffee, crisp and sweet to the taste, and very filling. These dates are produced in Xinzheng, south of Zhengzhou and Nanchang. In Xinzheng, five out of ten townships are entirely planted with dates, with an annual output of 60 million catties. Currently, each catty is only selling for three yuan. Following the fresh dates, persimmons are also on the market here. Small ones can be bought for more than ten for every thousand yuan, and large ones can be bought for about seven or eight. Persimmon cakes produced in Sishui and Gongxian are particularly famous. There are still quite a few Guangdong merchants ordering persimmon cakes from Zhengzhou. If transportation is convenient, the harvest from this farmers' sideline occupation can be restored immediately.</p>
<h3>Two Prostitutes in Hong Kong Deported for Ten Years</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Hong Kong 1st dispatch] The highest authorities in Hong Kong officially approved the deportation of two "streetwalkers" for ten years on October 31st. Deporting prostitutes is not only unprecedented in the history of Hong Kong but also rare in major cities around the world. These two unfortunate women: one named Tan and one named Li Xiang, both claim to be married women working in factories. The former's husband installs light bulbs, and the latter's husband sews canvas shoes. However, because their wages were not enough to maintain their lives, they began to solicit on the streets. They have been arrested five or six times, so the police, on the charge of "vagrants," petitioned the Hong Kong government to deport them.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province's Land Price Tax Starts at Ten Million</h3>
<p>"Our newspaper's Zhenjiang 2nd dispatch" The land registration and reorganization of eleven counties including Zhenjiang has been completed. The starting point for the progressive land price tax for each county this year has been approved in the 133rd meeting of the provincial government and set at ten million yuan, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Because the land tax in each county is about to be levied, the county governments are specially ordered to temporarily use ten million yuan as the starting point for progression before receiving approval from the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>The Prosperity of Dantu Town is Promising</h3>
<p>"Our newspaper's Zhenjiang 1st dispatch" Rong Desheng, the "Flour King," and others are currently making large investments in Dantu Town in this county, establishing the New Shen No. 9 Cotton Mill and a large-scale hydroelectric power plant. Therefore, many officials and businessmen are racking their brains to prepare for the revival of industry and commerce. According to reliable news from the Department of Construction: the plan to revive the entire greater Zhenjiang is only a matter of time. The department has also dispatched personnel to the town to measure the water depth, as Dantu Town is close to the urban area, adjacent to the Yangtze River, and has convenient transportation. In the future, after the establishment of the New Shen No. 9 Cotton Mill and the large-scale power plant, the bright future of Zhenjiang will be transformed and advanced due to the beginning of this driving force.</p>
<h3>The Issue of "Import Permits" is Rife in Hong Kong and Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Guangzhou 1st dispatch] Along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the Dongjiang River, "Expedition Teams," "Speeding Car Groups," "River Crossing Teams," "Little Devil Teams," "Sea Eagle Factions," and "Airplane Guys" and other "Risk-Taking Heroes" appear from time to time. The customs authorities have seized more than two billion yuan worth of smuggled goods in half a month in as many as fourteen cases. Customs revenue has fallen twentyfold, with daily revenue of only twenty to thirty million, and the national treasury is suffering unprecedented losses.</p>
<p>Following the "Tongtian Pass" of the Jiu You Fist, the market between Hong Kong and Guangzhou was once rumored to have a so-called "Import Permit" issue. This issue is related to the life of Guangzhou's import and export trade, the market in South China, and even the work of the South China branch of the Transportation and Management Committee. However, the South China branch of the Transportation and Management Committee has strongly stated that there has never been an "Import Permit" and immediately sent personnel to Hong Kong to investigate. In the meantime, a senior official of the Transportation and Management Committee (Deputy Director Tian Ding'an) also stated that the so-called "Permit" would absolutely not be issued by the Transportation and Management Branch. They said that there were only two possibilities for this news: one was "fraud" and the other was "rumor." However, newspapers everywhere described the shape, color, and size of the "Permit" in vivid detail. Whether there is "definitely such a certificate" or whether "the biggest connection lies in the Kowloon Customs" can only be resolved when the truth comes out, as Mr. Tian Ding'an said, "Paper cannot contain fire."</p>
<p>A few days ago, in order to encourage export businesses, the South China Transportation and Management Branch established a Property Small Group Committee for Export Goods and a Price Review Committee for Export Goods to solve the financial difficulties of export merchants and help export merchants settle foreign exchange. However, due to the "development" of smuggling in South China, the foreign exchange black market price is like a race between a rabbit and a hare (the difference between the official price and the black market price reached 30% within ten days). How many exporters can receive a little subsidy and endure the suffering of 30%? (Reporter Liang Xiaozhong)</p>

<h3>The Defense of Suining: A Detailed Account of Chen Yi's Disastrous Defeat</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper's Xuzhou October 28th dispatch] Suining is located at the midpoint of the Xu (zhou) Huai (yin) highway line. It is the gateway to northern Jiangsu. Therefore, it occupies a pivotal strategic importance. This small town, less than two li in circumference, has not yet recovered its original prosperity since it was taken back from the bandits last year.</p>
<p>At 9 a.m. on October 12th, General Sun Liangcheng, commander of the 25th Division of the Regular Army, made a speech at the Suining Senate: "The bandit Chen Yi led three divisions of his Third Column, namely the 7th, 8th, and 9th divisions, with a total of nine infantry regiments and one cavalry regiment, totaling about 15,000 people, and secretly crossed the Jinpu Railway at Xisipo on the night of the 10th, and have successively captured Lingbi, Sixian, and Qigang before fleeing back to northern Jiangsu. If the bandit Chen wants to wreak havoc on northern Jiangsu again, he must attack Suining." He also said: "As long as everyone unites and defends firmly, I guarantee that reinforcements will arrive in three days." Commander Sun went to Suqian to oversee the defense that afternoon. The Suining military and political authorities convened an</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>in the afternoon and decided to defend the city and vow to "succeed or die." At that time, the garrison in the city consisted of only two companies from the 25th Division's transport battalion, four companies from the Suining Security Regiment, three heavy machine guns, and two mortars, which were their most valuable heavy weapons. To defend the city, they must first strike out. This is a preemptive tactic to gain the initiative. Wang Yunwen, deputy commander of the Security Regiment, led two companies to deploy along the Su River southwest of the city on the evening of the 12th. They engaged in a skirmish with the bandits near Dali Village on the morning of the 13th. In the afternoon, the bandit army reinforced, and the fighting became more intense. The bandits were forced to retreat. Later, the bandits changed their approach, not attacking head-on, but sending plainclothes teams from both wings to outflank them. Deputy Commander Wang Yunwen, facing overwhelming odds, withdrew to the Jingmen (25 li southwest of Suining) stronghold and defended the</p>
<p>Four Blockhouses</p>
<p>on Jing Mountain. The bandits used heavy artillery to bombard them, and three blockhouses had already been destroyed. Deputy Commander Wang was determined not to break through. When that blockhouse was destroyed, Deputy Commander Yu finally sacrificed heroically. Two-thirds of the officers and soldiers of the two companies were killed or wounded, so they risked death to break out of the encirclement and returned to the city.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 13th, the bandit Chen deployed for the siege. The bandits used six regiments to attack the city and four regiments to guard it. Ten li outside the city were included in the cordon, on the one hand to prevent the defending army from breaking out of the encirclement, and on the other hand to prepare to meet the National Army's reinforcements. In this way, the defending army's belief in "fight to live" was further strengthened. On the night of the 13th, the bandit army launched a fierce attack on the South Gate of Suining, and the fierce battle lasted all night, but the bandits did not succeed. On the morning of the 14th, the bandits launched a full-scale attack on the city and used artillery to bombard the defending army on South Gate Street. More than half of the Second Company of the Security Regiment was killed or wounded. District Chief Liu Jingxian, South Gate Town Chief Hu Huamin, District Team Deputy Ge Wenhua, and Company Commander Zhang Yuqing successively died. South Gate Street was abandoned and not defended. At night, the bandits concentrated their firepower on the East Gate, using large knives to cut the barbed wire outside the city gate and using direct-fire guns to bombard the gate tower. The tower collapsed, and more than 20 bandits poured into the city and</p>
<p>Engaged in Street Fighting</p>
<p>The sandbag fortifications and deer-fence obstacles were shattered by machine gun fire. Deputy Battalion Commander Li led the reserve team to rush to the scene and annihilated all the bandits. In one night, the bandits rushed into the East Gate three times, but were all annihilated or repelled.</p>
<p>The defending army was unifiedly commanded by Song Xiangfu, battalion commander of the 25th Division's transport battalion. Battalion Commander Song was stationed on the large blockhouse in the center of the city, calm and resolute. At night, he used signal flares to direct the defense. Wherever it was urgent, he personally led the team to kill the enemy. He strictly ordered the defending army to hold their positions. When the bandits rushed into the city, they used machine guns to sweep and bayonets to stab. They were not allowed to shout "Kill!" because if they shouted "Kill!" at night, the neighboring defending army would know that the bandit army had rushed into the city, which would shake their morale. Therefore, during the three melee battles at the East Gate on the night of the 14th, the neighboring defending army did not know until dawn. Every night, in addition to hearing the sounds of heavy artillery, machine guns, and rifles, and seeing the sparks of bullets in the sky, the city was as silent as death.</p>
<p>The bandit army's</p>
<p>Charge</p>
<p>was a company as a unit. After this unit died, another company would come up. After it died, another company would come up. This kind of attrition fatigue attack was really powerful. The bandit army used machine guns to command the night battles. These were Russian-style machine guns. The sound of the guns was particularly loud, and they used bursts and single shots to command the attack or retreat.</p>
<p>On the 15th, the bandits turned to attack the West Gate. At midnight, the bandits broke into the West Gate with one company. Battalion Commander Song personally participated in the bayonet fight, killing ten bandits in one breath. He himself seized seven rifles. Later, the bandits attacked four more times, but were all annihilated. Because the bandits were</p>
<p>Exhausted</p>
<p>after several battles before attacking the city, the defending army was well-rested and naturally had the advantage. At noon on the 16th, the 51st Division of the National Army and Sun Liangcheng's troops arrived to rescue, and the siege of Suining was lifted. The bandit Chen's dream of wreaking havoc on northern Jiangsu was completely shattered.</p>
<p>Zhang Xuezhong, commander of the Huaihai Pacification Area, arrived in Yaning from Huaiyin on the afternoon of the 17th to inspect the area and express his condolences to the defending army. Commander Sun Liangcheng accompanied him and commended the soldiers and civilians who had contributed to the defense of the city. Battalion Commander Song Xiangfu had the</p>
<p>Greatest Merit</p>
<p>and was promised to be promoted by two ranks (from lieutenant colonel to major general). Chairman Chiang also sent a telegram to Battalion Commander Song and all the officers and soldiers to commend them, and they were rewarded and credited separately.</p>
<p>In his own review meeting after the disastrous defeat, the bandit Chen said: Since leaving the Yimeng Mountain area, the Third Column had captured 28 county towns, none of which had withstood an attack for more than three hours. This time, they fought for three days and three nights, and the total loss of casualties and deserters was 15 companies. Nine company commanders died, not to mention battalion and regimental commanders.</p>
<p>Indeed, the bandits suffered more than 1,500 casualties, and more than 1,000 took the opportunity to desert. Now, outside Suining City, there are many scattered bandits surrendering with their weapons every day. The bandits said: "We can't get enough to eat, we are still wearing ragged single clothes, we are running around every day, and we are forced to be cannon fodder. Following Chen Yi is a dead end sooner or later. Surrendering is really the only way to survive." (Special Correspondent Zong Chunlin)</p>

<h3>Hualian Football Team Defeats Hong Kong Army United, Yichen Longhai, and Other Middle Schools by One Goal</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Hong Kong] Football matches are a dazzling sight, with a full schedule all week. After losing on the 28th, the Shanghai Hualian Football Team launched another attack on the 31st, defeating the Army United team at the So Kon Po field. But hold on, let's first look at the league results for the 29th and 30th:</p>
<p>29th (Wednesday): Hong Kong Club defeated South China 2-0, Inverness defeated the Police team 3-0, Kitchee defeated Kwong Wah 1-0, and the Navy team defeated St. Joseph's 7-3.</p>
<p>30th (Thursday): The Bus team defeated Dyer 8-1, Li Dao and the Chinese Club tied 0-0, and the Eastern Club defeated the Artillery team 3-0.</p>
<h3>Three Teams Compete for Championship in Hong Kong League</h3>
<p>Since the long-victorious Kitchee team was defeated by St. Joseph's, the league situation has changed dramatically. Now, Li Dao has been forced to a draw by the Chinese team, and Bus, with the addition of Zou Wenzhi, is reinvigorated. Because the schedule is a double round robin, the team that can continue to win will be the champion. Let's see which of the three heroes wins the title.</p>
<p>31st (Friday): The Shanghai Hualian team deployed troops for the second time and set up camp at the So Kon Po field. The Army United team lined up to meet them. The number of spectators was neither crowded nor too sparse. When lining up, Hualian's forwards had Yao Hai but were missing Yao Shun and Yao Yao, with Yao Shui taking the field. Yao Qixiang rested due to injury, and Lin Gen played. Shi Xin also limped onto the field, kicking with a "limp" that was "wonderful." The two lineups were as follows:</p>
<p>Hualian in Hong Kong Draws with Sing Tao 2-1</p>
<p>"United Press Hong Kong, 3rd" The Shanghai Hualian Football Team played its last match in Hong Kong today, drawing 2-2 with the Sing Tao Expeditionary Team. Sing Tao took a 2-0 lead, but the Shanghai team scored two consecutive goals in the second half to tie the score. The whole game was dull, with each team scoring one penalty kick.</p>
<p>Shanghai Hualian Team: Zhang Banglun, Yan Shixin, Zhang Lingen, Han Longbo, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Qu Yongfu, Li Yichen, Yao Longhai, Gu Yiche, Fei Chunhua</p>
<p>Hong Kong Army United Team: Garasi (Artillery), Sutter (Air Force), Greeney (Navy), Karachi (Artillery), Bana (Dyer), Sha Ba (Artillery), Hunter (Inverness), Kia Neng (Inverness), Mitchell (Inverness), Connors (Dyer), Johnson (Bavaria)</p>
<p>Two Consecutive Goals in the First Half</p>
<p>After the start of the game, the Army United team started the attack after winning the ball, but the Shanghai team immediately gained the advantage. Yongfu headed high, and Yichen shot wide. The mixed attack lasted for 14 minutes. Chunhua broke through on the right and passed the ball. "Lazy Cow" followed with a furious shot, and the ball was as fast as an arrow, scoring the first goal. Hualian immediately gained the victory and continued to attack. After 16 minutes, Yichen headed the incoming ball, and the ball crossed the goal. Longhai rushed forward and flicked it in with his foot. After Hualian switched to defense with two goals, the Army United team tried to counterattack, but although they were able to penetrate the enemy area, their shooting skills were lacking. Most of the competition was in the midfield, and the shots were just for show. The only highlight was Longhai's single-handed attempt, where he had already picked the ball past the goalkeeper, but unfortunately hit the post. Yongfu rushed forward to shoot again, but was saved by Bana. As the melee continued, with Banglun in the Shanghai team, the Army United team was unable to score a goal. The game ended, and the Shanghai Hualian team won by two goals.</p>
<p>Hualian Team Forwards Active</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai Hualian team was missing two key players, the forwards had more of Yao Longhai and Yiche, taking the lead in the charge. The forwards were much more active. Although Yongfu on the wing was not very fast, his passing and shooting were well-coordinated. Yichen played like he was no longer a "lazy cow." The Shanghai team's victory depended on his shot, as well as his fight for the midfield ball.</p>
<p>Because the Army United team's front line was weak, the Shanghai Hualian's defense was stable, so the center back could focus on fighting for the midfield ball, and the situation was firmly in Shanghai Hualian's hands. The Army United team's forwards were too bad, especially the right wing. The forwards did not have good offensive capabilities, and the defense was unable to hold firm. As a result, they ended up with a double goose egg.</p>

<p>Introduction to the Malayan Chinese Expedition Team - Central News Agency Reporter Cai Baiqing</p>
<p>Deputy Captain Guan Yide (Negri Sembilan, left inside forward)</p>
<p>Deputy Captain Guan Yide was already famous in the Malayan Chinese football world at the age of fifteen, and still shines brightly today. He is a first-class talent and the captain of the Negri Sembilan Inter-State team, highly respected. In 1930, he once represented Malayan Chinese on expeditions to Shanghai, Saigon, and other places. Zhang's fans call him "Old Man," meaning he is qualified. He is good at using his brain and often wins by surprise. He is 35 years old this year.</p>
<p>Goalkeeper Zhu Zhicheng (Singapore)</p>
<p>He is 23 years old this year and has served as the goalkeeper of the Singapore Chinese Football Team. He learned his skills while studying. After joining Singapore Chinese in 1941, he received guidance from Bao Jiaping, the "Iron Gate" of South China, and his skills improved rapidly. His goalkeeping style is unique, with steady legs and feet, often taking the initiative. He was the goalkeeper in both matches against Sing Tao in June this year.</p>
<p>Goalkeeper Chen Shengwei (Johor)</p>
<p>He is 28 years old this year and is the first Johor player to be selected to attend the All-Malayan Chinese Games. His goalkeeping style is not fixed but purely natural. His recent performances have received much praise.</p>
<p>Left Back Chen Jiawan (Selangor)</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Jiawan and his younger brother Jiasheng are a pair of famous backs who have shocked Guangdong. People in the country have probably heard of them long ago. Jiawan is 33 years old this year and specializes as a left back. Since 1935, he has been selected to represent Selangor at the All-Malayan Inter-State Games. He has participated in many expeditions to the motherland and has rich experience. He is agile and has excellent heading and kicking skills. He is also strong and generous. The Chen brothers were instrumental in Sing Tao's defeat to the Malayan press team. When Sing Tao went to England, he was invited to join, but it did not happen due to some reason. It is said that this pair of brothers may be selected as our country's representatives at the World Games to be held in London next year.</p>
<p>Right Back Chen Jiasheng (Selangor)</p>
<p>Jiasheng is ten years younger than his brother. He began to emerge in 1940. Some fans here say that "Jiasheng works hard while Jiawan takes the credit." This is because Jiasheng is young and strong and always runs around the field under his brother's planning, making the defense as solid as a soup made from gold. Jiasheng's foot skills are excellent with both feet. His heading and interception skills are also skillful, with the same style as his brother. His long-range clearing kicks are especially appreciated by fans. In the match between Malayan Chinese and Sing Tao, one kick every half a field often turned danger into safety for the Chinese team, turning defense into offense.</p>
<p>Defender Zhang Guoxing (Negri Sembilan)</p>
<p>Nicknamed "Dull Face," he began his football career in Kuala Lumpur in 1938. He is a regular representative of the Negri Sembilan Inter-State team. He is 28 years old this year, 5 feet 10 inches tall, and weighs 160 pounds. He is good at long-range kicking and interception, and is very brave. In addition to football, he is also good at baseball, and is famous in Selangor and northern Malaysia.</p>

<h3>National Bank Actively Investigates Returned Checks, Sends Staff to Clearing House for Spot Checks, Analyzes Causes and Discusses Measures</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that the financial authorities are actively cracking down on returned checks. The other day (the 1st), the National Bank and the Ministry of Finance jointly sent staff to the check clearing house for spot checks. On that day, a total of 3,927 checks were returned, with a total value of $432,938,804,327.65. A total of 369 checks with larger amounts were selected for analysis. The reasons for the returns were: funds not yet received for collection accounted for 38.5%, overdrafts accounted for 23.3%, contact payable, please contact the issuer to collect accounted for 15.2%, insufficient funds accounted for 10.9%, payment stopped accounted for 2.5%, check not current accounted for 2.5%, incomplete or unclear seal accounted for 2.2%, suspension of overdraft accounted for 1.6%, account closed accounted for 0.8%, no endorsement by payee accounted for another 0.5%, unclear or inconsistent endorsement accounted for 0.5%, illegible handwriting accounted for 0.5%, changes not certified by issuer's seal accounted for 0.5%, other reasons accounted for 0.5%. The authorities will discuss countermeasures based on the above statistics.</p>
<p>Another report states that the money market is tightening as the authorities intensify their investigation of returned checks from banks and financial institutions. Yesterday, a total of 11,875 checks were exchanged, with a total value of $2,355,573,304,000. The four banks and two bureaus had a shortfall of $30.5 billion, with black market interest rates ranging from 10.8 to 22.5 cents. The number of returned checks yesterday has not yet been fully tallied, but is expected to be considerable. Therefore, the investigation is continuing by staff from the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank. According to the Deputy Director of the Auditing Department of the National Bank, the end of the lunar year is approaching, and if strict controls are not implemented, there will be major fluctuations before the new year. After this investigation, returned checks can be gradually reduced; reduced returned checks can also reduce the number of transactions, and prices can also be stabilized. In addition, the credibility of checks can also be rectified and improved.</p>
<p>The General Administration of the Four Joint Banks is also paying close attention to this matter, believing that the increase in returned checks is sufficient to affect finance and prices, and has sent a special auditor to Shanghai to supervise the investigation.</p>
<h3>Government to Formulate New Measures to Attract Remittances from Overseas Chinese, According to Statistics from the Bank of China, Overseas Remittances Have Returned to the State Before the Foreign Exchange Change</h3>
<p>The current change from fixed to flexible exchange rates has two main objectives: to encourage exports and attract remittances from overseas Chinese. However, since the promulgation of the new foreign exchange measures, the gap between the black market and the official rate is very large. Export goods can still be exported with difficulty, but overseas remittances are still being evaded. According to statistics from the Bank of China, overseas remittances did increase at the beginning of the foreign exchange reform, but then gradually decreased, and have now almost returned to the state before the foreign exchange reform. There have been many suggestions for improving overseas remittances, such as allowing foreign currency deposit certificates for overseas remittances, allowing overseas Chinese to ship back necessities, and even advocating raising the official foreign exchange rate. The government has consistently failed to adopt these measures after weighing domestic and foreign situations and the advantages and disadvantages. The last price fluctuation was difficult to sell due to the high foreign exchange rate, and the current price surge has been quelled. If the official foreign exchange rate is close to the black market, it will inevitably stimulate prices again. Other measures also have their difficulties. However, overseas remittances are an important source of foreign exchange, and their relationship to the balance of international payments is extremely important, and the government will certainly not continue to sacrifice this huge amount of foreign exchange. According to sources familiar with the matter: under the current circumstances, the only way to resolve the overseas remittance issue is to set a separate exchange rate. The exchange rate for overseas remittances should be equal to the black market rate, so that overseas remittances can flow in continuously. If there is a difference with the black market rate, overseas remittances will still be difficult to achieve the expected goal. The folk remittance bureaus have their own history and credibility, but the general overseas Chinese still believe in the guarantees of the national banks. During the period of foreign exchange liberalization last year, folk remittance bureaus in Southeast Asia requested the Bank of China to resume business relations, transferring the overseas remittances they had absorbed to the Bank of China for transfer. It can be seen that the overseas remittance issue is entirely related to the exchange rate, and the folk remittance bureaus are not an obstacle to overseas remittances. Therefore, the government may take measures to set a separate exchange rate for overseas remittances in the near future in order to remedy the situation. It is generally believed that foreign exchange earnings from exports must be exchanged through the export of goods, while overseas remittances can be obtained without goods. The importance of overseas remittances over export goods has its own unique factors. According to a financial authority, if the government implements this plan, it is estimated that there will be no problem in earning 150 million US dollars in overseas remittances.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Foreign Exchange Settlement for Self-Funded Study Abroad to be Communicated to Designated Banks Within Days</h3>
<p>According to a news release from the National Bank, the bank received the "Rules for Foreign Exchange Settlement for Self-Funded Students" formulated by the Executive Yuan on October 29. The bank's Non-Import Commodity Foreign Exchange Examination Committee immediately studied the relevant technical issues in the implementation of the foreign exchange settlement portion of the above rules for self-funded students and plans to distribute circulars to notify the designated banks to operate accordingly within one or two days.</p>
<h3>Bank Bureaus Loan and Calculate Interest on Packing, Four Joint Banks Approve Three Measures</h3>
<p>In order to assist in the export of goods, the Four Joint Banks previously formulated three principles for packing loans, stipulating that exporters who export goods may mortgage foreign exchange bills of exchange and export goods to the National Bank for loans during the packing and sorting period, with a time limit of three months. It has been quite effective since its implementation. However, the interest rate has always been calculated in accordance with ordinary loans. In order to cooperate with the foreign exchange policy and encourage exporters to accelerate exports, the various bank bureaus will, in addition to handling packing loans in accordance with the above principles, review and approve three methods for calculating interest: 1. For periods within 10 days, the monthly interest rate is 5%; 2. For periods exceeding 10 days but within 20 days, the monthly interest rate is 6.5%; 3. For periods exceeding 20 days but within 30 days, the monthly interest rate is 8%.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Initially Firm, Then Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 16,000 piculs of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The stores were still actively stocking, and the market was lively. Japonica rice continued to rise by 20,000 yuan, and indica rice also increased by more than 10,000 yuan. Early thin rice rose by more than 20,000 yuan, while white yuan and yin yuan were flat. At noon, all commodities fell, and sentiment softened. Flour was actively traded in small quantities and rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, but the market was also quite slack at the close. Skin Township sales were active, temporarily showing a firm trend. Bean cakes were inactive, showing a slightly weak trend.</p>
<p>Soybeans from Longhai sources were being received continuously. Arrivals from the Yangtze River were not weak. Abundant supplies of Pudong Pinghu Du Huang rice were available. Shantou factories were not actively stocking. Trading on the street was normal. Few customers were stocking. Du soybeans plummeted by 10,000 yuan, and customer soybeans also fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Mung beans were being shipped from both the north and south oceans, subtly tightening. Red beans continued to be absorbed by the Guangdong group and remained firm. Broad beans remained slack in small quantities, sluggish, and falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cowpea oil was sluggish in stocking and flat. Red sorghum from Kent Island was being actively traded, and oil factories were purchasing, creating a lively situation and rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Corn from the north was being picked up selectively at high prices, continuing to rise by 10,000 yuan, while medium and lower grades were flat. Raw peanuts remained depressed. Trading on the street continued to move, temporarily showing a firm trend. Sesame oil factories stopped trading, and customer sales stalled. The street was looking forward to it, but supply exceeded demand. There was no buyer, and prices fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, with very few transactions.</p>
<p>The oil market was in a slump, with Jiangbei's continued arrival of raw oil causing a sharp drop of 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Soybean oil also continued to fall by 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil and Qing oil also saw a gradual drop of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The Edible Oil Allocation Office is currently handling the allocation of oil, and there is still little optimism in the oil market.</p>
<h3>Offices of the Textile Adjustment Committee Established in Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that the Tianjin and Guangzhou offices of the Textile Adjustment Committee were established at the end of last month, and the Wuhan office can also be established in the first ten days of this month. It is also reported that the cotton cloth pricing will be decided by the Textile Adjustment Committee on the 12th. Statistics for the southern transport of yarn and cloth in the previous month show 4,120 bales of cotton yarn and 99,217 bolts of cotton cloth. 2,996 bales of cotton yarn and 47,386 bolts of cotton cloth were handled on a special basis. The Textile Adjustment Committee has separately urged factories that have not yet delivered the foreign cotton they spun on consignment in the second phase to deliver them continuously this month. As for the labor cost, it is still under discussion between the two parties.</p>
<h3>Quantitative Output of Oil Raw Materials Should Pay Attention to Market Fluctuations</h3>
<p>After the output of oil raw materials was changed to a quantitative permit system, the export volume was reduced to 39,000 tons according to the meeting of the International Food Emergency Committee and shipped to various countries according to a ratio. According to oil industry authorities, the quantitative export system restricts the export volume and does not have much impact on the market. However, it is feared that the announcement of the export details may cause market fluctuations, because exporters may compete to purchase in the market, which may affect market prices. However, there is no problem with the supply of oil raw materials. The current output in North China and Northeast China is very abundant. If transportation is convenient, the domestic supply is more than sufficient. Therefore, after the implementation of the quantitative round-out system, the government should pay attention to exporters competing to purchase in the market and opening up transportation to allow raw materials from North China to flow south.</p>
<h3>National Economic Council Reviews Joint Allocation, Textile Federation Sends Representatives to Express Opinions</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The National Textile Federation recently received a telegram from the National Economic Council in the capital, agreeing that the Textile Federation should send two representatives to express their opinions at the National Economic Council's cotton yarn joint allocation review meeting to be held on the 3rd of this month. After receiving the telegram, the Textile Federation immediately selected Liu Piji and Rong Erren to attend as representatives. The review opinions will be submitted for discussion at the National Economic Council meeting on the 4th. It is also reported that the allocation plan for private factories has been drafted and will be announced today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Another report states that, according to yarn industry sources, the most important focus of the current dispute between the two parties is the "flexible pricing" point. Currently, factories believe that factory costs have increased after the increase in the cost of living, so future pricing must be flexibly increased. However, officials believe that if pricing is adjusted every time, it will be seen as leading to price increases, so the handling is also quite difficult. Shares were initially stable yesterday morning, but soon collapsed again. Major players in the industry sold off their inventories, leading to a gradual decline. Although there were bulls continuing to short, the downward trend of stocks was difficult to reverse, and the process was very bleak.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, due to the reduction of margin requirements and news of US aid, buying increased and prices rose. From 292 yuan and 295 yuan, Yong Yarn opened, and retail sellers immediately supplied, slightly downstream. It once rose to a high price of 292 yuan for immediate delivery and 297 yuan for deferred delivery. After selling off one after another, it gradually went downstream. Off-market interest rates remained at 19.5 cents and 24 cents, but fell to 282 yuan and 287 yuan. At noon, under the lack of activity and maintenance, it retreated to a low price of 277 yuan for immediate delivery and 282 yuan for deferred delivery. The afternoon closed slightly higher at 279 yuan and 285 yuan. Except for New Asia, which had limited transactions and fell more than on Friday, matches, Xinhua, Huafeng, and Zhongsi also fell slightly more, while the rest of the stocks were flat and weak. Compared with Saturday, stocks for immediate delivery included underwear, Hengda was still flat, Rongfeng rose slightly, Yong Yarn, Xinhuo, Meiya, Xinguang, Qinxing, Zhongfa, Yongni, Zhabei, Huaxin, Datong, and Huaxin fell slightly, Huafeng matches, Xinhua, and Zhongsi fell by half a percent, and New Asia fell by 10%. Deferred delivery stocks included Xinguang and Meiya fell by half a percent, and Yong Yarn, Xinhuo, Huaxin, Jingfu, and Qinxing fell slightly.</p>
<p>The after-market was stable. After the opening, the opening yarn retreated to 278 yuan and 282 yuan. There was buying and a slight consolidation. The National Bank's exchange had a shortfall, and money tightened. Before closing, it retreated to 277 yuan and 28 yuan. Xinhua Department Store's implementation of capital increase, the stock exchange revealed the public share recognition, and it was the last half-day of trading, causing retail investors to be disappointed (actually giving three shares and recognizing four), leading to a large number of liquidations, pushing it down to within 60 yuan. Yong Yarn closed at 280 yuan and 283 yuan. Tongyi was the only one that was stable, but the cement five and, lacking opponents, fell sharply. As a result, compared with the morning close, stocks for immediate delivery included Jingfu, Zhabei, and Hengfeng were flat, Yong Yarn, Tongyi, Meiya, Zhongsi, Huafeng, matches, Xinguang, and underwear rose slightly, Huaxin, Rongmeng, An, and Qinxing fell slightly.</p>
<h3>National Bank and Bureau Relocation to Beijing, Executive Yuan Stipulates Steps</h3>

As for whether a branch will be established in Shanghai for the Shanghai business after the relocation of the head office and bureaus to Beijing, it is reported that the National Bank has no plans to set up a branch in Shanghai, but the business bureau may be delayed in relocating to Beijing. The remaining securities, Jinglun and Jinfang fell by half a percent, and cement fell by 10%. Among the deferred delivery stocks, Yong Yarn, Xinhuo, Huashan, and Meiya fell slightly, and Jingfu and Xinguang were flat. Among the old stocks outside the market, cultural stocks and bank stocks rose by another half a percent, while the rest were flat. Xinhua Yonggong Department Store is undergoing a capital increase, which has been rising in the market recently, and trading has been temporarily suspended. After the capital increase is completed, the new shares will be auctioned for immediate delivery from today, and deferred delivery will be resumed from Thursday, with the transaction unit temporarily set at 100,000 shares.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds and Foreign Shares Both Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, public bonds were repaid at twice the amount of pre-war deposits, failing to reach the national price, causing people to feel timid. Unified Class C opened in the morning at 12,000 yuan, retreated to 19,300 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. Rooms 555 and 644 sold, while rooms 552 and 550, as well as small money shops, accepted them, with a turnover of just over 4 million. Compared to last Saturday, Classes A and B fell by 1,000 yuan, Unified Class C fell by 1,000 yuan, Class D was lower by a large hundred yuan, and Class J was lower by 1,100.</p>
<p>Foreign shares were mediocre and gradually declined yesterday. Although Universal Films was being bought, foreign merchants and the gold industry were selling. Ewo Silk opened in the morning at 190,000 yuan, retreated from 191,000 yuan to close at 187,000 yuan. Hong Kong-Shanghai Telephone also hovered around 6 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Ewo Silk, British American Tobacco, Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, and Steel Telephone experienced slight increases, while Yieh Guang, Shanghai Dockyards, Jardine Matheson, China Merchants Steam Navigation, and Asiatic Petroleum each fell by half a percent.</p>
<h3>Rayon Declines</h3>
<p>The rayon market slumped yesterday, and sentiment was very weak. There were rumors of Japanese goods arriving in Shanghai, causing widespread panic, and people rushed to sell. No. 120 Toyo opened in the morning at 79 million, falling all the way to 75.5 million, a drop of 4.5 million compared to last weekend. No. 120 Mixed Brands with luster were between 74.5 million and 75 million, all falling by more than 4.4 million. All Raw Silk Purchased for Export</p>
<p>Since the China Trust Bureau started purchasing raw silk this year, it has collected a total of 3,997 bales to date, and it is expected to collect 13,000 dan. The original deadline for all manufacturers to deliver was the end of this month, but there is currently a trend of delays, so the end of the China Trust Bureau's purchase work will also be postponed. The raw silk that has been purchased has been successively exported. Currently, a total of 2,365 bales have been sold, with 1,200 bales shipped to the United States, 1,000 bales shipped to India, and the remainder shipped to the United Kingdom and France. There are still 1,632 bales remaining, which will be shipped for barter trade with the Soviet Union. All of the raw silk purchased has been exported.</p>
<p>Another report: According to Fan Chongshi, a leader in the Sichuan silk industry, the raw silk in Sichuan province this year has been purchased by the China Trust Bureau at the end of last month in accordance with the government's regulations. A total of 900 dan were purchased at a price of 31.73 million yuan per dan, and the procedures were completed three days ago. Fan also stated that although the government's purchase price is only half of the market price, fortunately, the price of goods in Sichuan province has been stable in the first half of the year, and the silkworm farmers will not lose money at this selling price. However, the cost of autumn silk is two to three times higher than that of spring silk, and there is currently no estimate of the output, which is estimated to be about half of that of green silk.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Actual Sales, Banks Tighten Credit</h3>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Decline Downstream</h3>
<h3>Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Falls 1.4 Million Compared to Saturday</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened mediocre, but then, due to tightening credit from all sides, many speculators were forced to sell. Furthermore, because of bad checks among yarn merchants last Saturday, the market was unable to support downstream prices. As a result, the final price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 1.4 million compared to Saturday, to 36.6 million yuan. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 200,000 to 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market was initially opened with dyeing factories and retailers snapping up goods. The price of Longtou fine cloth gradually rose by 910,000 yuan. However, due to strict credit withdrawals by the authorities, and the increasing number of bad checks in the market, credit tightened, and actual sales were stagnant. Speculators, in turn, sold off, and prices subsequently declined. As a result, various types of Longtou fine cloth, such as 12-pound cloth, fell by 7,000 to 15,000 or 16,000 yuan compared to Saturday. However, fine twill, bleached cloth, raw cloth, and high-end Schreiner cloth, which were selling well, rose by 15,000 to 50,000 yuan. The market for all other cloths tended to be weak.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market was weak. Due to the urgent need for credit, merchants turned from buyers to sellers. Yarn factories were not enthusiastic about purchasing due to the decline in cotton yarn prices. Transactions in the market were active on dips, with 1,500 bales changing hands. The prices for cotton delivered to factories were: Shashi 3.658 million, Qidong 3.555 million, Han Fine 3.47 million, Han Coarse 3.06 million, and Zhongtong 3.06 million, with 600 bales changing hands. The prices for cotton delivered to warehouses were: 3.737 million, White Luo Went 3.7003 million, Han Fine 3.27 million, Andong 2.86 million, and Shandong 3.637 million, with 900 bales changing hands. Zhoupu cottonseed was 637,000.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth Shipped South</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] China Merchants Steam Navigation’s "Haitian" vessel resumed its service to India yesterday, carrying 600 bales of cotton yarn and 285 bales of cotton cloth, which were shipped to Bangkok by the China Trust Bureau. 100 tons of soybeans and 100 tons of potatoes were shipped to Hong Kong, and more than 20 tons of sundry goods were shipped to Singapore. Very little was shipped to Calcutta.</p>
<h3>Strong Domestic Tea Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, domestic tea was still in strong demand, especially this year's fried green tea, with Ai Qian, Shui Shao, and others being highly sought after. The activity of the tea shops on Mu Street was unprecedented in recent years, and the prices were consistently strong as sellers took advantage of the old. As for the foreign tea market, since exporters offered prices for export varieties that were attractive to customers, they have been holding the reins due to high costs, unwilling to part with their goods. Transactions in recent days have been in a state of negotiation and compromise, and have not yet become active. China Trust Old Tea Sold Out</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] On the 30th of last month, the China Trust Bureau held its fourth auction of more than 4,000 boxes of enemy-property export old tea, mostly black tea. The goods included teas from Lianghu, Fuliang, Ningzhou, and Qimen, totaling 3,441 boxes, and the remainder were green teas, approximately 1,112 boxes. Among them were varieties such as Shou Zhen Gong Xi and Xia Mu Zhen Mei. Many exporters from this city went to participate enthusiastically. As a result, Jardine Matheson and Wing Hing foreign firms, Wu Chang, Tung Tai Cheung, Ting Chun Tai, Pei Feng, Ting Kang, Wing Fat, New Zhou, and Zhongnan tea companies successfully bid for all of them. The price was from 640,000 yuan to 1.46 million yuan per dan. A 20% deposit was paid at the time, and the full amount will be paid within ten days. It is understood that the selling price of these varieties is still low, but because they have been stored for many years, they must be re-baked before they can be shipped abroad.</p>
<h3>Highly Conductive Purple Copper Wire</h3>
<h3>Changed to Non-Quota Import</h3>
<p>The Import and Export Control Commission has submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval to change the high-conductivity, uncoated, unstranded purple copper wire from Schedule A to Schedule B, which means that the import of this item will be changed from quota import to non-quota import.</p>
<h3>Great Flexibility in Purchase Rules</h3>
<h3>All Industries Hope for Mutual Understanding Between Officials and Merchants</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Sixteen import and export trade associations held a discussion meeting at the Iron Trade Association on Hong Kong Road in the afternoon to jointly discuss the "Detailed Rules for Handling Goods Arriving and Starting Transportation with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange without a License" announced by the Import and Export Control Commission last Saturday. More than 20 people in charge of each association were present. All industries expressed satisfaction with the Commission's regulations. However, some of the regulations in the detailed rules are quite flexible, and it is hoped that they will not be strictly enforced during implementation. Especially during the allocation and negotiation of prices, it is still hoped that officials and merchants can understand each other in order to achieve reasonable fairness and smooth resolution.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabrics Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, woolen fabrics tended to be stable. Local customers were intermittently buying. There were many transactions in overcoating fabrics. As the cost of living rises, and the production costs of various factories increase, the current prices of woolens are high, and most are unwilling to compromise and sell. On the contrary, there are many people within and outside the industry who go to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Hankou to try to ship woolens to Shanghai. Confiscation due to inspection is common, and many parcels sent by post are detained. Yesterday, China Textile's black and gray overcoating fabric sold for 950,000 yuan, Meifeng's for 1.35 million yuan, McConnell's for 630,000 yuan, and Army Ship's overcoating fabric for 510,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Commercial Briefs</p>
<p>The General Administration of Cotton has completed the allocation of cotton to yarn factories. It is reported that the total number of spindles operating nationwide is 4 million, and 10,000 spindles can be allocated slightly less than 500 bales of cotton from the General Administration of Cotton. Recently, Taiwan Sugar Corporation's production has increased compared to the past. Recently, in response to orders from Japanese merchants, sugar will be shipped to Japan in succession. It is reported that the first batch has been set at 50 tons.</p>
<p>Cotton yarn and cloth produced by Textile Construction are sold to Abyssinia, East India, Australia, and other places. In particular, East India and India have a more urgent need for cotton cloth. Other countries such as Cairo also have a great need.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Puller</h3>
<p>— Xu Qinwen</p>
<p>Having received a few pecks of low-priced rice, I found it inconvenient to walk home.</p>
<p>"Rickshaw!" I called at the school gate, feeling unnatural, because it had been a long time since I had made that sound, and I had been walking to and from school lately.</p>
<p>After explaining my destination, the rickshaw puller said it would cost three thousand yuan. I remembered that the last time I took a rickshaw because I was sick, it only cost eight hundred yuan. Just like getting a haircut, the price increases every time, and you have to ask about the price. Although the amount of three thousand yuan was very unexpected, I felt unfamiliar with the situation and didn't want to bargain casually, so I just sighed softly, "That's so expensive!"</p>
<p>"Two thousand," the other party seriously continued, "Sir! This is just the price of one liter of rice! Rice is so expensive now, and pulling a rickshaw, you have to eat. Am I asking for too much?"</p>
<p>"But our salary," I said, "has not increased with the price of rice."</p>
<p>Finally, we settled on two thousand yuan. We loaded the rice into the rickshaw at the school and started moving along the road with a rumbling sound. I sat in the rickshaw, with the rice bag blocking my feet, which was very uncomfortable. When going up and down bridges, the rickshaw puller looked strained, and I felt dangerous. After turning two corners, I knew there were no more steep bridges. The rice was still brown, and I wanted to have it milled at a shop with a rice mill, so I started talking to the rickshaw puller.</p>
<p>"Are you from Shaoxing?" I asked, knowing from his accent that he was a fellow villager.</p>
<p>"How many rickshaw pullers here aren't from Shaoxing?" he quickly replied, "Pulling a rickshaw is hard, but now, the number of rickshaws is being reduced, and even this hard-earned meal is getting hard to come by. Who would want to pull a rickshaw! We used to weave silk in the weaving factory. The silk business wasn't doing well, the factory closed down, and that's why we had to pull a rickshaw. The rickshaw tax has increased again, to 180,000 a month, 6,000 a day. Two people take shifts, and each person has to pull 3,000 yuan for nothing every day."</p>
<p>He seemed very emotional. I wanted to comfort him, but I didn't know what to say.</p>
<p>"Sir!" he suddenly started a new topic, "Rice is so expensive, you can eat sparingly, and it's okay. We use our strength, and we have to eat a lot, so it's really unbearable!"</p>
<p>"It's unbearable for us too!" I said, finding something to say, "Eating sparingly is a thing of the past. Now, I always walk back and forth, which also takes strength. I eat less oily food, and meat is so expensive, so I can only eat vegetables. When I'm hungry, I have to eat more rice!"</p>
<p>"You're right," he echoed, "Now, you teachers are also suffering!"</p>
<p>Mentioning the milling of rice, he sighed again, saying, "Before, rice shops, rice shops, even the rice milling machines were destroyed. There are fewer machines, and the rice can't be milled in time, making it even more difficult. The low-priced rice is always brown, and no place is willing to mill a peck or two for us. Brown rice doesn't cook well, and it doesn't give you energy. And you can't accumulate three or four pecks to mill at once. As soon as you have rice, you have to cook it and eat it. Sir! This is how we do it now. We soak the brown rice overnight, then scoop it out and cook it the next day, so the rice can cook better."</p>
<p>Saying this, it seemed that he had already decided on a solution for me, and he pulled me all the way home. Although this was our first conversation, it was as if we were old friends, and we were very close in the face of life's difficulties. In terms of income, he earned slightly more than I did, but his living situation was not better than mine. What I secretly admired was that his spirit of perseverance was stronger and more resolute than mine.</p>
<h3>Unstable Souls</h3>
<p>— Li Baifeng</p>
<p>Just like Dostoevsky's "The Insulted and Humiliated," I felt this way as soon as I saw the old blind beggar kneeling on the side of the road.</p>
<p>His two blind eyes stared straight ahead, like the eyes of a dead fish, frozen and empty. The journey of life had not recorded anything on them. They were so blank, just like a piece of white paper that had never been written on.</p>
<p>Although he couldn't see anything, I knew from his begging voice that he was very aware of the passing pedestrians and vehicles. He seemed to distinguish the delicate footsteps belonging to a fashionable woman, and the confident stride, knowing it was a rather proud gentleman... So he called out, using various, person-specific, pitiful tones.</p>
<p>Like a plucked string, his tone was always so trembling, intermittent, speaking the most touching words of the soul; however, perhaps because of the narrowness of his thoughts, perhaps because the big hand of hunger choked his throat, the words he used were so poor and powerless! Just imagine: in such a city of pleasure-seeking, who would be moved by these one or two moans of hunger?</p>
<p>In fact, it is not because people's hearts are as hard as stone, but because there are too few people who can truly think and listen with their hearts. People are busy saving themselves from the abyss of life, how can they have the mind to listen to his tearful plea?</p>
<p>He knelt upright on the terrazzo slab, his hands resting on a cane, like an old tree that had endured wind and rain for a long time, supported by a pillar standing on the open plain. Its root hairs could no longer hold on to the soil under its feet.</p>
<p>A few gray whiskers swayed weakly in the breeze like withered reeds. His powerless fingers grasped the cane tightly, like the coarse roots of an old tree holding onto the stone... This is a stone statue of suffering, explaining China, and representing China!</p>
<p>Pedestrians and vehicles came and went quickly in front of him, and no one would cast a glance at him. In the center of this bustling city, his existence was like a stone, a piece of rotten wood.</p>
<p>As dusk entered the city, the old man tremblingly stood up from the terrazzo slab, groping with his cane and a few wrinkled banknotes in his hand. He did not know their value, and kept asking passersby, while not believing everyone who told him.</p>
<p>Using his cane as his eyes, the old blind man sighed softly, as if with infinite apology, he left the slab where he knelt every day. I seemed to hear an unstable voice saying to me</p>
<p>"Don't just pity the one you saw with your own eyes, but pity the millions of those you haven't seen; don't always help this old man who is about to enter the coffin, you should support the young ones who are growing..."</p>
<p>I looked around blankly, and some ragged shadows flickered in front of me. I knew they were all hungry, unstable souls, and only in this unstable country would these scenes appear.</p>
<h3>Leaving Kunming</h3>
<p>— Lin Yongquan</p>
<p>Travel Notes 1</p>
<p>In the end, I left Kunming. Because I have been to many cities, I am familiar with the feelings of staying there and leaving there. I particularly avoid the saying "what is left behind, not in the present, is all good." The same is true for Kunming. Even in the most annoying times, I would use reason to explain to myself, "But many of her places are still lovely." And today, to those that are inherently annoying, I still have to say: "Evil!"</p>
<p>Kunming, like other cities, has political institutions, but what's worse is that it's more chaotic and dirty than other cities. The Chinese nation's patience is too great. Those who should be responsible ignore the uneven roads; ignore the hungry people on the streets—especially during temple fairs, the roads outside the temple gates are full of lines of beggars stretching for more than a mile; ignore the desolate mountains everywhere and don't plant a tree, and even build their own walls of evil, building them thick and high, using bricks and soil that are actually base and dirty but thought to be noble and glorious. They are accustomed to it and even take pride in it...</p>
<p>But all the beauty that nature can arrange has been arranged, such as the warm, unhurried climate; the always clear and towering lakes and mountains; and the endless flowers of all seasons... They are all too memorable, and there are always some sincere friendships there! Although they are also from afar.</p>
<p>It was yesterday, leaving from the small building on the side of the highway. On a clear morning in May, the tender yellow young leaves of the large poplar trees greeted the rising sun, appearing particularly fresh and bright. There was no fog in the refreshing air, only the coolness formed by the breath of grass flowers and leaves, wandering in the empty stream. The green lawn collected some small dewdrops, and some coolness permeated upwards from the feet of pedestrians from time to time.</p>
<p>The train departed at 8:10. Regardless of whether it was temporary or long-term, short separation or eternal farewell, it was all farewell. Looking at the tall and lush mountains, the clear and wide lakes, the long dikes and long trees that still remained built by our ancestors, as well as those kind faces, the forms of evil were all left behind.</p>
<p>People, everyone is like this, recognizing them one by one, and then saying goodbye to them one by one. Unexpectedly, I was sickened by the excessive coolness of the morning. Soon after the train started, my whole body started to feel sick. At first, I was still struggling to support myself, but later I had to lie down and bought an unoccupied first-class seat to lie down. Wherever the train passed, I couldn't look around due to the pain, and I couldn't say goodbye to the mountains and rivers reflected on the train. In this dream of life, who knows if I can come again, if I can be a "former Liu Lang"?</p>
<p>Because I had to change trains from Qujing to Zhan Yi, this really made me suffer. I could hardly stand up, and I managed to ask a neighbor to help me move my luggage over, and then I stumbled onto the iron feather car with no space, leaning diagonally against the door. It was extremely dangerous, and I vomited several times, swaying outside the car.</p>
<p>In several moments of clarity, I always thought: it's over, life is over, I'm going to fall off the train like this, otherwise, I'm afraid I won't be able to support it to Zhan Yi; moreover, there's not a single acquaintance there, even if there's still a breath left, what will I do? The best way is to take the train back to Kunming tomorrow, but can I last until then? And will I still have the strength to get on the train?</p>
<p>Like waiting for heaven and earth, I finally waited for it to arrive at Zhan Yi, and I don't know what kind of power made me not fall off the train, and did not encounter that terrible thing. The train stopped, and I fell at the station. In a daze, two porters carried me to a hotel near the station, and I was thankful for the two soldiers who took care of my luggage.</p>
<p>Now I am healed. I found a doctor in a panic after arriving at the hotel yesterday and was cured; it was after sweating profusely less than two minutes after getting an injection. It was just like a sudden rain and then a strong wind sweeping away the cloud of disease. I was trying such a disease for the first time, and it was so ferocious and terrible that it reached its peak. But it was also the first time to recover so quickly. At that moment, when the comfortable blood flow instantly ran through my whole body, I exclaimed in surprise. "Thank you, sir, this injection is so effective, I'm better, completely better." I wiped away the hot sweat.</p>
<p>Today, I will rest for one day according to the doctor's instructions, and tomorrow morning I will step onto a long, new journey again. This place did not keep me, did not extinguish the light of my life. The stone tablet of hope and ideals has been erected again, life continues, and I walk forward, leaping and bounding like a rebirth, towards the vast future journey.</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Yaoqun frowned and shook her head when I mentioned this, but then she smiled: "This guy, you can really say he's one of us; because we need him to provide information. There are several places in the headquarters of the Japanese special agents that I can't get into; at the same time, I don't understand Japanese..."</p>
<p>"Do you think his information is very reliable?" I asked immediately.</p>
<p>"So far, the information he has provided is not only clear and understandable, but also reliable. As for what will happen in the future, I dare not say." Yaoqun seemed very sure.</p>
<p>"One more thing, do you think she has given you all the information she has obtained?" I think this is very important.</p>
<p>"I dare not say that." Yaoqun hesitated a little: "Because this guy is very resourceful, maybe he has collected a lot of information, and what he has informed me is only a part of it. Maybe..."!</p>
<p>"Then, are you very sure that Miss Baishafu hasn't revealed any information about our work in front of the Japanese spies? Suppose she plays the same role between us and the Japanese invaders; in other words, she tells us some information from the Japanese side, and then completely conveys our information to the Japanese special agents, do you think..."</p>
<p>Yaoqun shook her head and pondered for a while: "Maybe there is such a situation, but my personal speculation is that he doesn't need to do this."</p>
<p>"What's your basis for saying that?" I also think this is very important and I must repeatedly explain it to Yaoqun.</p>
<p>"There's no great basis... If you want to say there's any basis..."</p>
<p>When Yaoqun said this, a strange light suddenly flashed in her eyes, like lightning, flashing for a moment and then disappearing. She raised her face and looked at the empty space, as if carefully observing a kind of book slice reflected by her imagination: "Mr. Yue, I think the only basis is based on an imagination. This imagination is a conclusion I drew from observing his actions these past few days..."</p>
<p>"Oh!" I couldn't help but blurt out, making such a surprised sound; but I was afraid of interrupting Yaoqun's train of thought, so I repeated the word "conclusion" in her mouth.</p>
<p>"In other words," Yaoqun didn't seem to notice my expression and continued: "Why does such a person risk his life, sneaking around on the edge of a knife, on the front line? ... There must be a purpose, isn't there? I'm not very sure about his purpose at the moment. But my grasp of everything about him is based on this one-sided assumption!"</p>
<p>"Could it be..." I was just about to ask Yaoqun if she could outline her assumption.</p>
<p>"But let me explain this assumption?" Yaoqun asked me immediately before I could finish speaking; while asking, she shook her head with a smile: "Because I'm afraid that my assumption is fundamentally wrong, so I dare not say it now. So far, in my heart, it is only regarded as an "assumption". I think you must also have an "assumption" in your heart. But whether your "assumption" and mine are the same, we can temporarily ignore it; and wait until a certain joint, I hope that at that time, we can explain each other and compare."</p>
<h3>Writing Tools</h3>
<p>— Dongfang Mengwu</p>
<p>Production tools are needed. These include a fountain pen, a pencil, a typewriter, a telephone, and some clothes to wear when eating out. In order to go to the editorial office, a bicycle is also needed; for writing poetry on rainy days, an umbrella is also needed; a chair and a house that can be used for a considerable walk (this is necessary when a person is writing poetry). In order to store some continuously obtained poetry materials, a cabinet for storing documents is also needed; in addition, there is a pipe and some cigarettes. (Mayakovsky)</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Concerning Feathers</h3>
<p>— Qun Lin</p>
<p>The lingzi, or feather, is the bird feather inserted upside down on a helmet, usually one or two feet long, preferably from a pheasant's tail or peacock's plumage. This ornament originally had no fixed system, but by the early Qing Dynasty, it was established as an object of royal favor and began to be valued. The "Shuowen Jiezi" does not have the character for ling (翎, feather), but although ancient China did not have feather ornaments, it had long valued feathers. The "I Ching" says, "Its feathers can be used as ornaments." In old operas, pheasant tails are often used to adorn the helmets of military generals. When adorned on a crown, it can also serve as a literary embellishment, called a "qiao" (翹, raised). Ban Gu's "Ode to the White Pheasant" says, "Releasing white feathers, dividing and raising elegance," and the "Rhapsody on Shooting Pheasants" says, "The patterned tail is raised and elegant." Duan Yucai notes, "The long hair of the tail must be raised high, hence the saying 'qiao' for anything raised high."</p>
<p>The Qing system's chanzhi, although worn hanging down, actually also had tails that were raised up. However, peacock feathers with "eyes" were considered more valuable. In the early Qing Dynasty, it was originally given exclusively to military generals with meritorious achievements. It was also associated with the military adornment and the saying of the "feathered forest army." The ancient "feathered forest" in the Han Dynasty was the heavenly army, officials guarding the emperor, also explained as being as swift as feathers and as numerous as the forest, but one can also imagine that they also had feather ornaments. In the Qing system, those rewarded with feathers were still military men. Those in the Imperial Bodyguard and Guard Regiment, the Infantry, and the firearms battalion, who were above the fifth rank, could wear peacock feathers on their hats, while those below the sixth rank only had a blue feather to distinguish them. In the residences of princes and kings, only the first-class guards were allowed to wear flower feathers; the rest still wore blue feathers. Furthermore, princes and kings, as noble relatives of the imperial clan, generally did not wear peacock feathers. Only beizi (a noble title) could wear peacock feathers with three "eyes" as a crown for officials. During the Qianlong era, Prince Shuncheng Qin, Ye Ying, when serving as the vanguard commander, requested a flower feather from Emperor Gaozong. The Emperor said, "The flower feather is what ordinary officials should have. If a prince wears it, it would be against the system." Grand Secretary Huan pleaded on his behalf, "The prince is young and just wants to wear something beautiful," and the Emperor finally allowed it. From then on, princes and kings were often granted such favors. Emperor Qianlong even considered making five-eyed flower feathers the standard for princes and kings, but it was prevented by Grand Scholar He Kun and never implemented. As for those with great achievements among the meritorious ministers in the early Qing Dynasty, some were occasionally granted unique flower feathers with difficult-to-obtain "eyes." Civilian officials in the outer provinces originally had no precedent for flower feathers. Also during the Qianlong era, Fang Guancheng, the Governor-General of Zhili, upon receiving his appointment, went to Gubeikou for a grand review and relied on his position to specially request a flower feather for the sake of appearances, which greatly pleased the Emperor. Gaozong smiled and said, "Looking at your dwarfish appearance, you also want a flower feather?" After some ridicule, he still granted it to him. Afterwards, this opened a precedent, and many high-ranking officials in the outer provinces were granted flower feathers. Nowadays, in some families, when ancestral god statues are hung on the wall on days of worship, they are also adorned in court attire with flower feathers, looking like noble officials, regardless of whether they received such honors in life. After death, they are all treated as noble officials. Perhaps it is self-mockery.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the War</h3>
<p>—— The U.S. Military Landing in Shanghai. By Bao Zhongqi.</p>
<p>During the final stages of World War II, the Japanese army was retreating on various islands in the Pacific. The U.S. military was approaching the Japanese mainland. It was generally speculated that the U.S. military's strategy was to land on the Japanese mainland and to land on the Chinese coastal ports for a pincer attack, cutting off the Japanese army's return route on the Chinese mainland. The four proposed landing sites were Huludao, near Shanghai, Fuzhou, and near Guangzhou, with the landing near Shanghai being the most likely.</p>
<p>To respond to this major landing plan, the supreme Chinese war authorities in Chongqing convened a meeting of responsible personnel from various departments and established a production bureau to specifically plan for the U.S. military's landing operation.</p>
<p>It was estimated that Shanghai's population was around 1.5 million to 1.7 million. If war broke out, approximately 25% might remain in Shanghai. Their food supply would be provided by the Food Department in the form of wheat products. At the same time, the locations of several key bombing targets in Shanghai had been approved by the Chairman, and the rear had sent personnel to notify the residents of Shanghai to evacuate. However, at that time, transportation and security were extremely chaotic, and residents were unable to evacuate. Fortunately, the war ended quickly, otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable.</p>
<p>The most important issue at that time was the supply of coal and electricity. It was assumed that all of Shanghai's power equipment would be destroyed. The landing troops would require a large amount of coal and electricity. The nearest coal mining area in China was Yixing, and it would be very difficult to connect the railway tracks to the coal mining area or to transport it by truck. Therefore, it was decided that "coal" would be transported by plane from the United States or the Philippines.</p>
<p>Of course, the number of personnel and equipment required for such a task was considerable. The authorities had allocated 15 aircraft and 30 trucks for transportation, and at least 3,000 tons of coal would be loaded onto trains daily. At the same time, Mr. Du Yuesheng had been appointed to establish a driving brigade in Lihuang, which could mobilize several thousand people in the event of war.</p>
<p>Medical and mechanical facilities were also considered, and everything was fully prepared.</p>
<p>The meticulousness of the plan was best demonstrated by the fact that the U.S. military inquired with Chinese agricultural experts about which vegetable seeds grew the fastest in case of food supply difficulties, to ensure that the food supply would not be cut off.</p>
<p>Everything was ready, and U.S. warships were approaching the Chinese coast, waiting for the Pacific typhoon in September to pass before the Shanghai landing, which had been brewing, was to be realized.</p>
<p>However, the invention of the atomic bomb hastened the end of the war. Before this plan could be implemented, Japan had already surrendered. While the victory saved the lives of many soldiers and spared Shanghai from the ravages of war, the sudden victory and the lack of preparation for post-war reconstruction led to widespread chaos in the takeover work, which was truly regrettable.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Yu Songhua</h3>
<p>— Chen Lijiang</p>
<p>Heaven is unjust; a wise man has suddenly withered. My grief over the passing of Mr. Yu Songhua is not only due to personal friendship but also to public duty, for Mr. Yu's failure to enjoy a long life is not only a misfortune for our college but also a great loss for the nation.</p>
<p>My friendship with Mr. Yu began in the sixteenth year of the Republic when I traveled with Mr. Yu's younger sister, Ms. Qing Tang, and Mr. Gao Jiansi, thus I came to know Mr. Yu. Later, when Mr. Yu was the chief editor of the Shen Bao Monthly, I often sought his corrections on my articles, and our friendship grew stronger. During the war, we often gathered in the wartime capital. In the summer of the thirty-fourth year, our college established the Department of Journalism, aiming to train journalism professionals with the ideal of promoting social education, which coincided with Mr. Yu's usual advocacy. After repeated requests from me, he gladly accepted the appointment as director. Since taking office, Mr. Yu has worked extraordinarily hard, formulating plans, searching for professors, and personally teaching, tirelessly. Universities at home and abroad that have established journalism departments, such as Yenching in Peking, Fudan in Shanghai, and the Central Political School, have already achieved results, but the journalism department of our college, led by Mr. Yu, has its own unique style. Its training of students is not only to make them news professionals but also to enable them to take on educational work, not only to equip them with the ability to work as "reporters" and "educators," but also to give them a noble outlook on life and a belief in the paramount importance of journalistic service. The method of training students focuses on individual conversations. Every student who has had several conversations with him has been transformed and become a young person with lofty ideals, indeed possessing the belief that they will engage in journalistic endeavors with the attitude of an educator. As the ancients said, "Those who teach by example are followed." Mr. Yu's personality was noble, and his attitude was sincere, so the students readily followed him. Had he been granted more years, a good atmosphere would have been created, and our country's "journalism" and "education" would have benefited together. Alas, Mr. Yu fell ill and never recovered!</p>
<p>Sudden decline spreads; the nation mourns. Some say that Mr. Yu was a standard figure in the journalism field, while others call him the "Achilles" of the journalism field. However, I believe that although Mr. Yu's lifelong career was in journalism, his ultimate goal was education. Mr. Yu was not only a well-known journalism professional but also an educator with the aura of a Confucian scholar. Mr. Yu's chief editorship of newspapers was to use newspapers as a tool to promote education, and his engagement in education was to cultivate "both literary and moral" journalism professionals as his goal. Mr. Yu's leadership of the journalism department of our college lasted only two years. Although the time was short, the results were great and will forever remain in our college, forever remain in education.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu was never in good health, and the wartime relocation east and west further weakened his body. However, he never neglected his duties for even a moment due to his physical weakness. Since taking charge of the journalism department of our college, he has been working hard to realize his ideals and has been devoting his heart and soul to the advancement of the department. After August of this year, he vomited blood several times, yet even as he groaned in bed, he was still urgently seeking out excellent professors and formulating teaching plans. His spirit of loyalty to his duty can be described as "exhausting his efforts to the end."</p>
<p>Mr. Yu was upright in character but kind to others. He treated the students like his own children, loving them with sincerity. Therefore, on the day of Mr. Yu's death, the students cried bitterly, and many colleagues also shed tears of regret. As for me, I regret the withering of a wise man and remember the friendship of the past. My feelings are endless. Thus, I compose this essay to record my sorrow.</p>
<h3>Specially Appointed Antarctic Ambassador</h3>
<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>It is customary for the President of the United States to attend the Washington "National Press Club" banquet at least once a year. In 1940, an interesting incident occurred at this banquet for President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>At the time, many guests surrounded the distinguished guest, vying for his autograph on their commemorative albums. One reporter, named H. M. Bratter, took a menu and wrote on the back: "Specially Appoint Bratter as Ambassador to the Arctic." He then folded it in half, covering up these words, leaving a blank space below for the autograph. Then, in the crowd, he mixed this piece of paper with many others' commemorative albums and sent it to Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Soon, the menu was returned signed, but Roosevelt was not fooled. When Bratter opened it, Roosevelt had crossed out the word "North" and rewritten "South," adding below: "The Arctic is already taken."</p>
<h3>Two Muslim Leaders</h3>
<p>— Polun</p>
<p>The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Huseini, is the leader of the 1.2 million Arabs in Jerusalem and is highly supported by the Arabs. Although the Arab countries are politically divided, they are very eager for independence. Arab political party leaders often encourage and stimulate the Arab people to quickly unite and defend the Arab nation. Due to Huseini's initiative, the strong resistance elements of the Arabs organized a secret alliance in Shen Dong, similar to the American Ku Klux Klan. There are 50,000 members who are all receiving military training. They are commanded by the Arab League, and their target is the Jews.</p>
<p>The leader of this secret group is called Hawari, only thirty-eight years old this year. He is a short but stocky man. He looks like a football coach. He advocates that every Arab man should marry four wives because this is permitted by Islamic customs so that the Arab population can grow and forever resist Jewish colonization. Hawari has an old mother but has nine children. He was deeply taught to oppose the Jews in his childhood because his father's property was sold to the Jews. Therefore, he is a penniless Arab, but he strives to study, especially mathematics; he establishes schools, instilling the sins of the Jews in Arab children, while also teaching Arab children not to trust foreigners, only to struggle by themselves to show their strength. In 1929, the Arabs launched a massacre against the Jews, which was also initiated by Hawari.</p>
<p>Hawari once said: "Arab youths are all receiving military training. Arabs know that Western countries cannot help the Arabs in the slightest, so they can only organize themselves to solve their own problems. Now the Arabs are going to realize their future ideals, preparing their own strength, money, and military power to achieve final success."</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Visiting a Grave on National Day</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>"He died before his mission was accomplished, making heroes shed tears forever." My brother, you loved the country and gave up your life. That moment of pain meant nothing to you. Willing to sacrifice became a choice, causing your sister to bear an empty name, getting up early and sleeping late, enduring hunger and cold, braving the wind and dew, and sweating on the road. The hardship of ten years, to whom can I tell? Even swallows have a day to return, but I ask you, why don't you come back? You told me that for a goose-shaped eagle, you harmed your father and mother, who swallowed you and spat you out in Stettin. I can't bear to hear it. The goose-shaped eagle, people see you as the almighty science, but in my heart, you have become the object of a lifelong grievance.</p>
<p>What can I bring to visit you today? I think of you in life, wanting to be magnificent and not willing to decay like grass and trees. Now, our compatriots are all living in drunken dreams, fighting for power and profit. I think you must be very unhappy in your heart. Before you, I am ashamed not to offer flowers, and I bow with heartfelt incense to pay my respects. Today, I am glad to celebrate National Day, and it is worth kneeling before you. Your past history is worth worshipping. Although there is no one in the garden, no sound of sparrows and crows, the cold wind is piercing, but it is as if I am facing you, without any fear. Sitting before you, I silently receive your teachings, and I am very happy. Reluctantly, I wrote a line on the stone tablet to leave as a memento. Your sister thinks that you are alive, hoping that you live among us. Do you know? Looking back at the country, the people are destitute. You rest in heaven, not needing to worry, this is your good fortune. I tell you that your sister is healthy, and Min'er is learning, and now the day has dawned after suffering. If you know in the afterlife, you can close your eyes with a smile!</p>
<p>Note: The goose-shaped eagle is an airplane.</p>
<h3>Two Special Zones in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ditanyuan, located at the Jinyuanyuan Wharf, was used by the Shanghai County government during the Qing Dynasty for seasonal sacrifices. It was located outside the Old North Gate. At the beginning of the Daoguang reign, when the boundaries were drawn, it was included in the French Concession. In the early Xianfeng reign, the Shanghai Taoist government designated the land as public land for sacrifices. Following the precedent of the autonomous Tianhou Temple in the Public Concession, negotiations were held with the French consul to reclaim it. Later, during the Taiping Rebellion, wealthy merchants and gentry from Jiangsu and Zhejiang flocked to Shanghai to escape the chaos and settled in the French Concession. To promote prosperity, the French Concession authorities expanded the Ditanyuan and built streets and shops, completely losing the original site. Today, when people in Shanghai talk about it, I am afraid that no one can explain the matter in detail.</p>
<p>The second is the Jinyuanyuan Wharf in the old French Concession along the Bund. In the late Qing Dynasty, goods piled up there, stretching for about two li. It was the real estate of the China Merchants Bureau. The China Merchants Bureau was also founded by Sheng Xuanhuai, established in the early Guangxu years. At the beginning of its establishment, because there was no land available for purchase in the French Concession, let alone build houses, it hired a large number of workers to fill the land in the Huangpu River, competing with the river for land, spending countless sums, and finally succeeded. Therefore, this wharf seems to protrude into the river, like a peninsula. Business was prosperous, and the rights were purely autonomous. Therefore, the French Concession authorities repeatedly seized the opportunity to speak out and negotiate, but Sheng Xuanhuai used the argument that "this land was filled by me from the river and has nothing to do with your boundary" to fight for it and was able to preserve it. If I do not come to Shanghai, and the sea changes, I do not know how the changes will be.</p>
<h3>Film Scene This Week</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>"Su Feng Ji" From the script of "Su Feng Ji," we cannot find its theme. After watching this war, the audience cannot figure out what the playwright wants to express. All that is there are scenes of lively embellishments. Because the playwright is only trying to sell the story, the tragedy of this female performer is hung in the clouds, and the audience is pushed to see flowers in a fog. Although flowery and lively, the result is emptiness.</p>
<p>In the play, the Kunqu actress Xue Lianqiu is weak and contradictory in character. She has no active upward aspirations, and her final suicide is even forced. As the heroine of a tragedy, such a character is really too weak. Another upright character, the journalist Liu Chengzhi, his beautiful words cannot hide his selfishness and deceitful behavior. His love with Li Ling is even more of a forced match by the playwright. The con man impersonating an Air Force captain, on the other hand, is particularly emphasized in the story. Therefore, this play is lively in sections, but also disconnected, unable to achieve a coherent whole. Even if we discard the content of the script, the scriptwriting technique is also a failure.</p>
<p>We regret that Tang Xiaodan directed this play after "Paradise Dream." Even if the scenery around Beihai and the Summer Palace is made more beautiful, it still cannot save the ending of the play, which is as sloppy and loose as it is.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it is really difficult for the actors. Li Liqiu's character is contradictory and vague. It is not easy for Lu Ming to handle this role in a simple and honest way. Xiang Kun's Yuan captain is superficial and lacks depth. Shi Hong's performance is stiff and affected, extremely clumsy. Zhou Ting, who plays Xiao Jinhua, is quite natural and appropriate. The performances of Lu Ming and Zhou Ting are the best in the whole play.</p>
<p>"Six Palaces and Powdered Dais" This long-promoted color film "Six Palaces and Powdered Dais" is not as exciting as expected. Although the color is quite gorgeous and the performance scenes are extremely lively, the script is loosely written, the development of the play lacks a process, and exaggerated gimmicks are interspersed quite often, even if the color is gorgeous, it still cannot compensate for the composition of the whole play.</p>
<p>"New Flames of Desire" "New Flames of Desire" is a French film. The story depicts a multi-faceted love affair. Its original name is "The Tempest," symbolizing the love in the throes of passion. The style is quite novel.</p>
<p>"The Bandit Pingfan" It emphasizes the goodness of human nature, but it also has some sentimentalism. In fact, it is still impossible.</p>
<p>Child star Margaret O'Brien is very cute, making it impossible not to like her, although this film's results are not as good as her "Green Township Jasper." Clarence Brown's rough style will not disappoint you.</p>
<h3>Random Gleanings of Duplicated Characters</h3>
<p>— Wang Shuzheng</p>
<p>In ancient people's lyrics and songs, the best use of duplicated characters is like the opening lines of Li Qingzhao's "Sheng Sheng Man": "Seeking, searching, cold, cold, clear, clear, miserable, miserable, wretched, wretched." It can be called a brilliant hand. Another example is Qiao Ji's "Tian Jing Sha" little poem: "Orioles and swallows, spring, spring, flowers and willows, true, true, things, things, wind, wind, charm, charm, delicate, delicate, proper, proper, people, people." Mr. Wu Mei commented that it is "clear, handsome and beautiful, not like a great master." However, words such as "chun chun" (春春, spring spring) and "zhen zhen" (眞眞, true true) are inevitably somewhat far-fetched, but these are rhymes, and it would be difficult to change them. (According to Qiao Ji's name, Mengfu, was from Taiyuan, and also known as Shenghe Weng.) As for Wang Shifu's "Romance of the West Chamber's" "Yue Diao Dou Qun Quail" and "Zi Hua Er Preface," he says, "Pricking up my ears to listen, tiptoeing to walk, quietly, dimly, secretly, waiting, waiting, waiting for my neatly, elegantly, gracefully, sister, sister," then it comes casually, and feels even more seamless.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation - Legal Interpretation</h3>
<p>A Stepmother Acts as the Decision-Maker in Arranging a Marriage, Leading to Disputes over Dissolution of the Engagement</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I am a male, 22 years old. When I was twelve, my stepmother arranged an engagement for me with a Miss Wang from the same village of the same age. At the time, I did not agree. When I left for the West at the age of eighteen, I twice entrusted my clansmen to notify the other party that I denied this engagement, but the other party kept delaying and even threatened to force the marriage. To deal with this, I published a notice in the newspaper to formally deny the engagement. The other party also published a rebuttal in the newspaper, saying in essence: "The engagement has been more than ten years, is it legal? There should be a matchmaker to prove it. I have been an adult for more than two years. If the woman suffers damage to her reputation and spirit, the parents should be responsible for compensation." This matter has dragged on for more than a year, and I am always uneasy. I have several questions to ask you to answer: Is the above engagement valid? Is their rebuttal reasonable? Should I be responsible for compensation for the delay? The other party's parents claim that they will never dissolve the engagement unless I pay a large sum of money. What should I do if they continue to threaten me with illegal means in the future? Do I need to sue the court first? If the court rules that the man should be responsible for all losses under the law, will the man bear the burden? Sincere Reader, Zhou Tongqiang.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Chuan Kuang's Reply] If the individual does not agree with the engagement arranged by the legal representative after reaching adulthood, he may declare it dissolved. The innocent party may request the guilty party to compensate for the damages suffered as a result. The matchmaker can be invited to mediate the amount of compensation. There is no need to sue first. If the responsibility lies with the man, he should bear the responsibility for compensation.</p>
<p>Reader Mailbox</p>
<p>To Mr. Mi Zijian of Shanghai: Your letter is too brief to allow for speculation. My humble opinion is that if you are ill, you should always seek the advice of a doctor, and you should not conceal your illness. It is difficult to diagnose an illness by correspondence, and no matter how detailed the description is, it is always better to seek medical attention and examination.</p>
<p>To Mr. Huang Yide of Shanghai: According to your letter, there is no ground for the crime of disrupting a family, and the father and brothers of the Chen woman should be held responsible for the crime of assault.</p>
<p>To Shen Yu of Wuxi: There is no such thing as "feng shui" in law. The criminal law stipulates that those who exhume graves are guilty.</p>
<p>To Ms. Qian Haiju of Shanghai: I have read your letter. Article 997 of the Civil Code stipulates: "A person who marries due to fraud or coercion may petition the court to revoke the marriage within six months of discovering the fraud or the termination of the coercion." Article 1052 stipulates: If one spouse is subjected to unbearable abuse by the other, they may petition the court for divorce.</p>
<p>Eight Thousand Gunny Sacks - Refugees Make Reed Mats - Hope that Charities Pay Attention</p>
<p>Our sales department has accumulated more than 8,000 gunny sacks for the purpose of making reed mats. We have always admired your concern for enthusiastic service. We intend to publish a notice in your newspaper. If there are any parties who meet the above needs, please send a letter to our headquarters at No. 525 Jin Zha East Road (intersection of Guangxi South Road) for contact. Respectfully submitted, I hope you will take care of it! To the Social Service Department of the Shen Bao Newspaper. China Textile Construction Company Shanghai Second Sales Department</p>
<p>Postal Q&amp;A</p>
<p>Our bureau has received letters from Mr. Lu Bingyuan of this city and Mr. Bi Xichang of the Seafarers' Fellowship, inquiring about the following points, which we will briefly answer below:</p>
<p>(Answer) 1. In addition to the Management Bureau, there are 21 branches and 6 postal kiosks in this city. The exchange rate is divided into special group and ordinary group. The special group is 1/1000 of the basic fee, plus a supplementary water fee of a certain amount, which is adjusted according to the local exchange rate at any time. The ordinary group is 1 cent per yuan for the basic fee, 4 cents per yuan for the special supplementary fee, plus a supplementary water fee of a certain amount, and adjusted at any time. The 40th Anniversary of the Post Office commemorative stamps were issued in 1936. Stamp collectors can buy stamps at any time. The office hours of the stamp collecting group are from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:30 PM every day. The business windows of the Management Bureau provide service around the clock. The branch offices are usually open from 8:30 AM to 6:30 PM. On Sundays or holidays, except for the Jing'an Temple, Sinan Road, Fujian Middle Road, and Jinling East Road branch offices, which are open all day, the rest are open from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM in the morning and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>2. For mail sent to Changshu, the bureau seals it twice a day. The first time is at 12:00 noon, and it is transported by the Xihu bus. The second time is at 9:00 PM, and it is sent by the Hujing 12th train to Suzhou and then transferred. It takes about two days to arrive. Unused diaries should be sent as small packages or parcels. Manuscripts sent for printing and publication can be sent as trade contracts. Fan surfaces, if blank, should be sent as small packages. If they have already been painted and inscribed, they can be sent as printed matter. The packaging method for printed matter and trade contracts should allow the post office to easily verify them. Due to limited manpower, the auto post office only accepts a small amount of registered printed matter. Airmail stamps are limited to airmail.</p>
