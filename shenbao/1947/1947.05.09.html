<p>〔中央社花蓮港八日電〕此間民間盛傳台灣光復時，日軍於東台灣山地埋藏軍用品甚多，尤以花蓮港山地銅門村附近爲最，目前銅門附近數條大隧道均被掩塞，且建築堅固，殊屬可疑。據悉：銅門鐵橋附近，日前已發掘鐵器二萬餘斤，銅門山上掘出製冰機器兩部，吉野地方掘出飛機上用之機槍一挺，月眉村掘出重機槍二挺。花蓮縣府刻又據報，吉野掩埋罐頭價値台幣三四十萬元，已派人掘出餅乾數箱，罐頭七十餘罐，尙在陸續發掘中，台東縣山地鄉民，前亦曾發現汽油罐頭等物，觀此情形，民間傳說或係事實。按日本投降時，駐台日軍大部退集東台山地，並曾運進大批軍火來此。</p>

<h3>莫德惠今赴台灣　以私人資格探視張學良　主席贈禮物托莫氏帶往</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國府委員莫德惠昨由京抵滬，定今晨搭中興輪赴台，莫氏行前語記者：「此行完全以私人資格，探望張學良氏，別無其他使命；因本人上次晤張氏，尙遠在去年四月貴州之行也。惟中央能准本人前往，亦足見政府對張之關切。台省收復之後尙未觀光，此次當盡可能游歷各地，而於二十日前趕回出席參政會。」莫氏對東北情勢不欲多評，但指出大連接收尙成問題。此東北元老認爲我國「科平統一必須早日實現，民主憲政必須早日建立，」並謂：對此具有強烈之信心、惟拒絕表示達到此目標之方法，認爲每個國民均有硏討之責任。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕莫德惠氏赴台，携有蔣主席托帶禮物一批贈送張氏。孔祥熙及其他張氏友好，均有禮物托便帶往。文張氏現居新竹，有趙四小姐爲伴，生活尙頗安適。</p>
<h3>張伯苓由平抵京　即來記轉京出席參政會　並向教部洽商擴充南大</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平八日電〕南開大學校長張伯苓今晨由津來平，定十日飛滬，十五日轉京出席參政會。據張氏對記者談稱，南開復員工作已完全就緒，敵人佔領天津，破壞南開最劇，崁應用房屋均已修復。最缺乏者爲圖書儀器，經濟硏究所圖書幸免於難，已由南方運津。今年敎部撥擴充改良費十億元，惟添置設備爲數仍微，敎授亦亟須加聘，並須募款修建。現計劃以八億元修建大樓七幢，充圖書館大禮堂之用。工學院基礎已備，現有化工電機機械一系，此次將與敎部洽商，正式增設工院。張氏繼稱，物價高漲，公敎人員在「餓不死」情况下，參政會自應詳細研究此一問題，但物價之嚴重尙未至經濟崩潰地步，國家前途至爲光明，因：（一）國際上已無壓迫，（二）國內有英明領袖領導國家走向民主之道。張氏談及敎授生活稱，「吾人惟有忍耐，始有出路，蓋國家又付敎育經費甚鉅也」。</p>

<h3>政院今召開特別會議　蔣勻田將提議廢止外匯管制</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京八日電〕民社黨政務委員將勻田，九日將向行政院建議，改革中國目前之經濟政策，包括廢止外匯率之管制，以基本商品交易之過分利得，認購公債及庫劵，並限制政府銀行放款等。蔣氏不願預測此一計劃將由行政院給予如何之考慮以及得有如何被採用之機會，僅曰，渠曾與其他政務委員討論此一計劃，後者並未表示意見，僅建議由渠以書面向行政院提出。行政院已定九日召開特別會議，討論目前之經濟危機。關於廢止外匯率管制之議，並不變更目前關於使用外匯之措施。蔣氏認目前之外匯率管制，不但無用且與政府有害。其弊端爲雖可鼓勵進口，但妨碍進口及僑匯，兩者使政府損失一大筆之外匯。蔣氏相信廢止外匯率之管制而逐日由中央銀行視市塲情形掛牌後，可使出口貿易趨於復活並鼓勵僑匯之流入。蔣氏承認此舉，對進口有相反之影響，但力言中國所急需者乃外匯而非外國貨。關於其建議之第二點，目的在吸收游資。蔣氏請過去黄金政策已吿失敗，而公債推銷成績亦不佳，爲鼓勵認購債劵庫劵並吸收游資起見，渠建議以基本商品，如米麵粉食油等之過份利潤，認購債劵，利潤係指除去成本，運費及捐稅所餘而言。即以此等利潤之百分之幾，購買債券。渠主張以利潤之百分之五十，視爲過分利潤，但此一數字尙非必須由行政院討論。關於第三點，蔣氏認爲不論政府銀行或私人銀行，放款對象應僅以生產企業爲限，而其生產物應僅以可以適用過份利得規則之主要商品爲限。政府因此可便於控制商品之生產及放款之使用。蔣氏認目前物價之猛昇，非僅僅供求問題，乃游資作祟。渠並謂在內戰進行期中，則使停印新鈔，亦不能控制投機。</p>
<h3>宋子文應召抵京　傳將赴美商五億貸款事　馬卿稱用款計劃已核准</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕府委宋子文應主席召，八日下午二時許由滬抵京。此行傳與美國之五億元貸款有關，因美國有稱中國若不在六月卅日以前提出使用該項貸款之計劃，則逾期將吿取消。宋氏日內即將飛美，惟是否請求延期貸放，待晉京後方能決定。</p>
<p>〔路透社南京八日電〕傳宋子文將以蔣主席特別代表之資格赴美，接洽進出口銀行指定貸華五億元借款事。此訊迄猶未能經此間高級權威方面證實。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七日電〕馬歇爾表示，相信最近中國政府之擴大，爲接受美國財政援助條件之步驟。渠繼以極謹愼之口吻稱，改組之效力如何，尙須拭目以待。馬氏於記者招待會中稱：渠知大多數人士，曾建議成立聯合政府，並謂行政院長張羣爲其異常欽佩之好友。渠希望改組後之中國政府，能盡力於其有建設性之工作，以趨向眞正代議制政府之途。馬卿並宣佈，國務院已核准由進出口銀行貸款實行之數項計劃，但迄今渠在處理必需之信用貸款方面，尙未成功。下列各項計劃已核准。即：（一）修復粤漢鐵路，（二）發展塘沽港口設備；（三）小額棉花貸款，（四）重建黄河鐵橋等。馬氏繼謂，甚至在渠離華之前，渠已希望獲得若干款項以完成上述各項建設計劃及渠認爲對恢復中國經濟極爲重要之其他同樣性質之計劃。渠强調渠曾要求目覩中國開始其建設計劃，當記者問渠進出口銀行所指撥之五億元貸款之申請期，是否將延至六月卅日之限期以後，渠稱，此問題將由全國對外貸款顧問委員會決定，國務院亦係該會之組成份子。</p>

<h3>米風潮波及京畿　社會局趕運麵粉到京平售</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕米風潮彼及京畿，京郊浦口鎭七日發生第一次搶米風潮，七日午後夫子廟再發生搶購麵粉，八日上午下關復有搶米行動，幸未成事實。京市府社會局與糧部爲此緊急處置，澈夜辦理，現已由市社局報請糧部核示辦理，惟八日米市已宣吿停頓，全日進口米僅百二十担，米船一艘而已。據社局局長謝徵孚語記者：京市米商存米不處缺乏，議價每担爲十四萬，每日供應千担，惟今日蕪湖方面米商來洽時，表示如仍爲十四萬，米源勢將斷絕，故謝氏正請示糧部辦理。據一般觀測，此次米潮，三面爲議價限額較黑市所低過大，不願出售，同時商號囤米採觀望態度，一面政府規定拋售之議價米，雖為一千担，但實際售出無法隨時統計，自不免有以少報多之勢，而少量議價米自不足供應市塲，致釀成搶風。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>正視當前的教育危機</h3>
<p>在物價問題及經濟危機深刻化的今日，我們又面臨着嚴重的敎育問題。本來，現階段的敎育問題是與我國戰後一般的社會經濟以及政治問題有着不可分的關聯。反映在敎育方面的問題，多半是一個政治經濟的問題。敎育人員待遇的菲薄，學校經費的困難，這些都不是純粹的敎育問題，郤與目前中國的社會經濟乃至政治問題息息相關。在一個較廣的角度下，這些問題倘使不在政治經濟局勢的大前提解決下，是幾乎無從解決的。但這不就是說對於這些問題，敎育的主管當局應該可以逃避責任。敎育人員待遇的菲薄，和學校經費的困難，旣屬於敎育的範疇，則主管敎育的當局便應該迅速妥籌對策。然而當前的敎育問題還不在此：當前的敎育問題不衹是一個經濟的問題，或經費的問題，還包括有政策的問題，風紀的問題。至於各級學校的制度是否適合目今的國情，那又是另一關於學制及課程問題。可知所謂敎育問題所牽涉到的範圍，也着實廣泛。</p>
<p>就經費或經濟方面來說；我們先後看見有各國立大學校長及敎授的呼籲。若干大學的敎授且發表宣言，以爲文官的最高薪爲八百，而敎授的最高薪只有六百，似乎有失公允。我們同情大學敎授的呼籲，我們了解大學敎授生活的淸苦，所以我們希望大學敎授的待遇能够提高，但我們同時又不能不爲中學及小學敎員的待遇呼籲。大學敎授的最高待遇還有六百元，又有硏究補助費，試問一個中學小學的敎員所得能有幾何，他們的最高薪能有多少？生活所需，大學敎授與中小學敎員又有什麽差別？目今政府財政雖極度困難，我們希望政府對於各級學校的敎員待遇都能予以調整，總期敎員們能够度他們淸苦的生活，來從事他們的樹人事業。</p>
<p>但目前教育問題的核心，不是一個經費的問題，郤是一個政策的問題。我們不明白什麼是我們的敎育政策。學制的問題我們如今不談，我們所不明白的是政策。臀如說，在浙江已有了國立浙江大學（至於說浙江究竟應否有國立大學，那又是另一問題，我們姑且不談），又有國立英士大學。我們知道陳英士先生是黨國元勛，他是浙江人，如果要辦一所國立大學來紀念他，也不是沒有理由的；但我們所不明白的是爲什麼英士大學要辦在與英士先生身前沒有什麼關係的金華？英士先生是湖州人，又是土海都督，而且死在上海，如果要辦英士大學的話，應該辦在湖州，或則應該辦在上海；在金華辦這麼一所大學，我們不懂。這是政策問題，與國家的政治經濟局勢無關，如今英士大學生正鬧着請求遷校的風潮，他們的行爲或不免有些越軌，但我們要指出的就是敎育當局如果有正當的決策，似乎也不會引起這次風潮。這責任敎賢當局是不能辭却的。</p>
<p>此外，各地又鬧着中學畢業會考的問題。敎育當局決定本年起恢復中學畢業會考，其所特理由謂在提高中學程度。此項消息一經公布，各地學生均表不安，紛紛請求免除。當此項消息騰載谷報紙的時候、據報載消息，敎部中等敎育司長却表示：『京滬兩地學生，已不再反對會老，』似乎中學畢業會考仍將舉行。各地中學生的反對會考，或有多種原因，我們不必多所申述。我們所要問的是：基於什麼政策纔有中學畢業會考的決策。就理論上講，像現在這種中學畢業會考制的採取是不通的。中學敎育的程度是否合乎規定的標準，敎育當局旣設有督學視察，自可隨時注意；若以會考制度的採行，希望中學敎育程度的提高，此與設置督學視察等人員之旨，似乎又相衝突。倘使會考之後，可以各　志願升入大學，是則所謂會考無異是大學的一種入學試騐；然而現制度下的中學畢業業考其性質又與此不同。會考之後，勢必又有大學入學試騐。則此一會考制度的採取在原則上就已有了問題。此一制度本不應採行，如今又欲恢復，這倒底是什麽政策？這無異敎育當局自己否認自己，學生的反對與否是另一事，我們不必論。</p>
<p>因爲教育當局本身的措施欠考慮，於是激起各地的風潮。學生行爲的越軌是不該的；例如這次英大學生晋京請願的風潮，據報傳消息，迫使滬杭間的鐵路交通也受了影響。若果所傳不虛，則這種目無法紀的行爲，我們爲中國大學生的令譽表示惋惜。但教育當局措置失當，實亦難辭其咎。此外，關於留學生的問題，關於男女分校的問題，敎育當局所採取的政策究竟是什麼，也令人不無疑問，百年樹人，敎育事業爲民族將來生命之所寄，我們不能讓它腐蝕下去，我們更不能讓官僚主義泛濫在神聖的敎育事業上面，我們願敎育當局對於敎育的決策上，能有明智的決定。</p>

<h3>美政府即將向國會提出　復興韓國經濟案　馬歇爾向報界正式宣布　國務院擬自陸軍部接收各佔領區</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日招待報界，宣布美政府即將向國會提出復興朝鮮方案。其他方面消息，此舉或將規定第一年經費七千五百萬美元。馬歇爾並稱：方案細則尙未完全擬定。一俟國會對援助希土法案，最後表決，此案即可提付討論。按照目前計劃，自今年六月三十日開始，一年內在朝鮮美國佔領區須支出七千五百萬美元，以補充一億三千五百萬美元以上之經常佔領費。此項經費用以恢復戰時損失之工業爲主。朝鮮工業生產能力目前僅達百分之二十。美蘇聯合委會現定於本月二十日恢復談判朝鮮統一問題，屆時如能成立協議，則重建電力廠與鐵路之經費或將修改。此項援助計劃是否將超越一年以上，端視朝鮮南部一千萬居民經濟自立能力而定。此外並有一復興朝鮮三年計劃，需費五億至六億美元，正在擬議中。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日在記者招待會上並作如下之聲明：（一）何時及如何進行對日和會籌備工作，現正在愼重考慮中。本人認爲國務院應自陸軍部接收日本，朝鮮與德國佔領區行政事宜。是否即將辦理移交目前不擬說明。前任國務卿貝爾納斯曾反對此案。（二）衆院度支委會建議裁减經費百分之廿二，成爲國務院當前一問題。該委會建議取消撥付經費之對外廣播事業實極重要。（三）法國賴瑪迪內閣逐出共黨閣員後，美國現未考慮給予法國特別援助。馬氏今日會與法駐美大使討論煤麥，國際銀行貸款及德境法軍與英美軍佔領區間有關勞工之匯兌等問題。</p>
<h3>保衛西半球公約</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓七日電〕美國某要人今日向法國新聞社記者談稱：馬歇爾國務卿亟望泛美洲會議及早在巴西京城舉行，以便美洲廿一國共和國簽訂保衛西半球之公約。國務院最近接到具體證據，證明阿根廷政府順從各項民主原則，使阿國有資格參加此一會議。</p>
<h3>美國務院內決定設立　外交政策設計局　將由蘇聯問題專家基南任局長</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕國務院今日宣佈，成立一特別設計局負責制定與推行美國長期外交政策事宜。馬歇爾繼貝爾納斯任國務鄉後，即決定設立此一局。該局在副國務卿指導下工作，將由服務外交界甚久之官員蘇聯問題專家基南任局長。另一國務院之職美外交家薩凡奇將任機要秘書。主要之任務爲：（一）制定與推行長期外交政策，以便達成美國外交之各項目標；（二）預謀應付若干國務院在執行外交政策時可能遭遇之問題；（三）對國務院可能交付之範圍廣泛之政治與軍事問題，作準備起草報吿事宜；（四）得由其自動建議，或由國務卿或副國務卿之請求，對於現行外交政策之是否適當，提出建議；（五）調整國務院內之有計劃之活動。</p>
<h3>蘇向匈牙利提額外要求</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦七日電〕此間可靠方面息：蘇聯與匈牙利現正進行賠償談判，蘇曾向匈提額外要求，總計達二億美元。根據停戰協定及和約，匈應支付蘇聯賠款計二億美元，停戰協定規定匈國應於六年內付清，而和約又將期限延長至八年，故蘇聯之新要求，等於匈國對蘇應付之賠償額。此項新要求之內容，約可分爲三類：（一）蘇要求匈國讓與匈境之全部德國資產，根據對匈和約第廿八條及波茨坦協定，蘇聯有權取得此項財產，其價値約及全部要求額之半；（二）蘇聯要求匈牙利向蘇償付戰爭結束時匈國欠德國之全部債務；（三）蘇聯要求匈國履行因下列原因而對蘇所負之債務：（甲）蘇聯於戰爭末期向匈牙利臨時政府所墊付之匈牙利貨幣；（乙）蘇聯配備匈牙利陸軍之費用。據悉目前之蘇匈談判中，主要爭論之點乃前述之第二項，匈國認爲戰爭結束時匈國雖對德負有債務，但德國亦對匈負有債務，故應先行抵銷。英國政府在目前階段雖尙不擬顧問，但知英政府之立塲乃爲於計算對德國所負之債務時應計及德國對該國所負之債務。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社東京八日電〕麥帥雖否認向日皇保證保衛日本之說，但外間之傳說並非無的放矢，此乃日本外務省情報局長岡村不愼所洩露。岡村在麥帥與日皇會議時担任日皇之舌人，事後向日本記者洩漏詳情，日記者又向某外國新聞社洩露。聞岡村昨日已引咎辭職，未被接受，但或將於稍後接受之。</p>

<h3>全市米商停業請願　聚眾尋釁搗毀電台　顏料店戲院煙行等多處亦遭殃及</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市米價連日上漲，人心惶惶。吳市長爲鼓勵米商運米來滬，雖巳允許自由買賣，但到源仍未見湧，價格亦未低落。升斗小民乃更形恐慌，打店搶米等不幸事件，亦隨之而發生。本市米商以米價高漲，罪不在彼，今竟横遭暴刧，殊爲不安，乃於昨日起，宣吿自動停業。昨日上午十時，零售米商三百餘人前往市府請願，推代表張毓懋，顧亞榮，沈栽之等七人，晉謁吳市長，陳述兩點：（一）對近日搶米打店事，請切實派警保護。（二）對各電台播音中横加每辱，請求設法制止。當由吳市長答覆，略稱：對第一點，如有不法市民乘機搗亂米店舉動，決予拘送法院，依法嚴辦，已令警局遵照，並電宣司令派員協助，以維漢安。至各電台如有故意造謠誹謗，可向法院控訴。吳氏繼謂：望米商將存米按照合法利潤出售。並稱政府拋米配售改善辦法，整個方案已送呈中央，待通過施行。</p>
<p>途中尋釁兩店遭殃</p>
<p>請願米商於十二時許退出市府後，隨又轉赴靑島路十九號華興電台尋釁。緣有在電台上唱滑稽名朱良者，藝名筱快樂，近以米價躍漲，且難購到，故於廣播時，常斥責囤積居奇之奸商，稱之爲「米蛀虫」，致觸怒若干米商，日前曾以電話警吿，謂如不改變態度，將有不利。筱未予置理。請願米商離市府後赴華興電台，即擬往該處找筱責問，途經九江路四五八號復興昶顏料店門前，彼等忽聞有人喚「米蛀虫來了」，於是大怒，即大打出手，將復興昶顏料店十分之九打毁，各色顏料狼藉滿地，打手始滿意而去。繼經牯嶺路復聞「米蛀虫」之聲，遂又將牯嶺路一二四號大中原煙行之玻璃一大塊擊毀，又毀五一弄六號史志奮醫師診所門一扇。</p>

<p>一時二十分，米商等抵達靑島路，逕行闖入「華興」電台。筱快樂在該電台之廣播時間爲每日下午四至六時，是時尙未到達。米商即自該電台樓下修理部打起，打至三樓播音間，所有機器均毁。米商尋筱快樂不見，以爲已逃往「華興」對過之明星大戲院，故又往該院尋事，將鐵門打毀。至此，新成警察分局及鳳陽路憲兵隊均已聞訊派警憲到達彈壓，風潮至三時許始平。</p>

<p>筱快樂家　妻女挨打</p>
<p>下午五時半許，米商等因筱快樂尙未打着，心有不甘，嗣悉其寓所在雲南路二三九號光華洗染店樓上，即雇坐兩卡車，人數約五六十名，駛至上述地點附近。停車後，先躍下七八人，　至三層樓，找尋筱快樂不在，即將其妻朱傳美雲（廿八歲，南京人），批摑一下，繼將筱之幼女名霞雲（七歲），亦猛打耳光。然後用木棒等擊毁梳粧檯，鏡框，熟水瓶，玻璃衣樹，打氣爐，碗盞等，一哄而散。後經老閘警局得報，亟由蔣股長督率大批警士趕往，奈米商等已溜走。遂將傳美雲傳局詢明被毁情形，經施分局長飭警兩名保護返寓。</p>

<h3>會考之恢復與改進</h3>
<p>— 陳東原</p>
<p>中學畢業會考，中國已實行十幾年了。雖在抗戰時期，除眞正戰區以外，我們都曾照常舉行。三十四年夏天，因復員關係，敎育部曾令後方學校，一律提前在五月底結束，準備復員，畢業會考也就聯帶暫停。本年敎育部通令恢復會考，這是很自然的事，但是學生們總覺得多一事不如少一事，因而有請暫緩恢復的表示，輿論界亦有響應之者。甚至有謂「學生旣籲請停止舉行，敎育當局便應採納輿情，變更辦法」的。會考應不應當恢復，我們可以研究，如果恢復會考有理由，就應當予以恢復，倘若因為學生有要求，便要答應，這是不合敎育原理的。</p>
<p>中學畢業會考，是敎育上一種制度。敎育發達的國家，如英，如法，如德，中等學校畢業生，都要經過校外人士主持的會考，而且要經過兩次會考。第一次考試在中學畢業前一二年，第二次考試在中學畢業的時候。通過了考試的人，也就可以自由升學，成爲一種制度。中國舉行畢業會考，有十幾年的歷史，也已形成一種制度了。雖然現在時局還不好，社會各方面還未安定，我們總希望各方面能早日恢復正常狀態的，制度恢復，是帮助恢復正常狀態的一種力量，無容反對，似乎也不應該反對。</p>
<p>有人以爲：會考目的在提高學生程度，覺得戰時培育的中學生程度，已無可諱言的低落，何必在短時間內，拿會考來提高呢？反對會考的人，大都以此爲堅强的理由。說這是「揠苗助長」。這種說法，是把前提看錯了。會考目的，並不在提高程度，而實在在整齊程度。現在中學的問題，並不在程度之需要提高，乃在於程度之不够整齊。如果需要提高程度，那應當在修改課程標準時注意。可是現在的中學問題，決不在此。相反的，當修訂課程標準時候，到一致贊成簡化，不要使學生負担加重。足見得我們並不希望將中學程度提高。但已經規定的課程標準，總希望能够達到。　而，對於學校敎學之是否認眞，學生程度之能否達到旣定的標準，必需有一種制度，加以檢査，加以督促。有了這種制度後，於是學校對於敎學不能不認眞，學生疏懶者不能不努力，而整個中學敎育，能達到最低限度的水準。這才是會考的目的。戰時學生程度，雖然低落，但究竟低落到什麽樣子，也有一加考査的必要。因爲低落，就不必會考，豈不是身體不好，因而反對檢査體格嗎？</p>
<p>畏難苟安，是人類的天性，自私也是人類的通病。在會考停過兩年之後，本年畢業學生，當然不免有再停一年的盼望。然而這正是畏難的自私的心理，不是敎育上應當允許的。如果學校當局恐怕自己學校畢業生會考成績不好，致影響學校的地位，因而助長學生反對會考，或假借會考機會，預先淘汰學生，以壯門面，這都失了敎育者應有的態度。須知學生離開學校之後，隨時都有參加考試的機會，隨時都要準備受別人的考騐。敎育者正應當督促學生，畢業前複習他們的功課。優良的敎師，應當指導學生對於功課之複習作一個系統的綜覽，學得一種條理，明瞭學科的要旨，而避免機械的記憶。如此複習，對於靑年益處甚多。所以我們正應當善用會考，不應當拒絕會考的。</p>
<p>我們也不必把會考看得太難。根據過去十幾年的經騐，各省市舉行會考，雖不說百分之一百的可以通過，然事實上及格的學生總都在百分之九十以上。在這次初恢復會考的時候，敎育當局的意思，無非要維持這種制度，並不在爲難學生，斷不會比戰前的會考更難。再爲學生言，萬一在盡了自己的力量之後，如終於落在未能及格的少數人之內，那一定是自己成績確有問題。與其勉强畢業，欺人自欺，不如安心在高中多讀一年，把基礎穩打一下，對於個人的前途，是只有利沒有害的。</p>
<p>衹有一個問題，是大家對於中國會考制度不滿的。就是會考只能取得畢業資格，而不能代替升學考試。以致學生在畢業的那一暑期，一連要參加幾個考試，不僅學生太苦，於理也不甚相合，因此有人主張，會考應與大學入學考試，合併舉行。這是很有道理的。可惜目前事實上還有許多窒碍，不能立即做到。所幸本年會考，已注意到這個問題。敎育部的通令，已規定參加會考成績最優的學生，得保送分發志願大學肄業，這已是一點進步。而上海各大學，最近更擬除敎育部規定的保送名額以外，直接憑會考成績，錄取一部份學生，這是再好沒有的事了。希望其他各地大學，都能有這種辦理，俾將來逐漸達到憑會考及格即可升學的目的，以完成一種完善的制度。</p>

<h3>參加明年世運項目　視本屆全運成績再定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京八日電〕第十四屆世界運動會，明年在英舉行，中華代表團遴選委員會決定選拔「足球」「籃球」「田徑賽」「游泳」四項，於「競走」「自由車」「棒球」等項，尙未決定參加。茲據體協會總幹事董守義談：上屆出席世運會之代表人數及競賽表演項目較多，如國術人員之參加，皆係商經商震先生特別資助出國，其餘經費，悉由會籌措，現因戰後復員伊始，會費困難，尙在籌募，加以外匯關係，事實問題，故此次參加之項目，勢須較少，要看本屆全國運動會之成績，如有特殊發現，經選拔會認可者，視經費許可，亦可酌量加八已決四項之外其他項目。</p>

<h3>華股跌風未已　午前雖一度回上終被撳住人心潰散瑞遞永紗均跌停</h3>
<p>華股昨臨收再吿慘瀉，午前曾有一度迴光返照，永紗在四角左右之重利下，高後終吿不支，港申電報升，幷傳借款消息，午後遂吿潰散，永紗會低於亭限百餘元，除商務漲停外，餘者有十之八九跌停。</p>
<p>套利交易，永紗掉期自三三〇元起，多方迫切貼出，銀行帮籌碼有限，一路扳高，近午達五五〇元及五八〇元高價。信和自二〇〇元迄二五〇元間。各小股自八元迄十五元間。合日息約二角弱起迄三角五左右，如略做心思，可獲四角左右。午後永紗由一八〇號貼予一五二號降至三七〇元，合息價不過二角半。</p>
<p>晨開　時美亞仍吿跌停，餘股尙形平穩。遞永紗上塲，多空互有掉期，形成盤局。在六五二〇元迄六六五〇元之間徘徊，後以三五號二一八號一五二號供給而微降。七五號二三七號七六號一〇二號二二三號九七號二三二號一二九號俱進，遞永紗仍吿扳高至六七八〇元。一五二號一五三號一五五號逢高了結，再退爲六六四〇元。一四五號二〇七號一四二號三五號一六號二二四號一五四號二二號八二號來進，買風一度熾烈，美亞由跌停回升，五和商務漲停，幷傳匯價有改爲四萬元之謠，遞永紗乃迫六九〇〇元高價。九四號八三號八渥號四號六五號一〇二號一一二號九七號紛賣，檯面帮及少壯派力撳，近午中絲水泥跌至停板，遞永紗乃回落至晨初低價，惟業外人及銀行帮有納，七〇號一四二號二三一號六五號趁低有納，午收尙穩。收後現永紗喊高至六一〇〇元，遞永紗達六六八〇元。結果較前收計永紗信和勤興景福新華各跌半成强，新光微升，美亞跌停，永公跌一成弱。遞交計前日祗半天交易，美亞跌停，永紗信和新光水公景福勤興各漲一成左右，冷股商務五和漲停，水泥跌停後微回，跌成半弱。中紡統益景綸各跌一成至一成半弱，中絲跌停，火柴平，餘均微降迄半成不等。</p>
<p>午後　港申電見升，人心不佳，開出即吿不支。美亞中絲首先跌停，商務由三一號買進，獨吿漲停。遞永紗由一四五號二二三號一三三號二二四號一八三號六五號一一七號三六號二三一號連袂賣出，夜報載有借款消息，又步降至六〇八〇元。一五二號一二九號三〇號趁低來進，曾回升至六二五〇元。入後大通火柴永公中紡水泥以及現永紗紛紛跌停，人心已吿潰散，一一七號一五三號一六〇號一六號二三七號六八號二二三號再竇，遞永紗乃跌至五八〇〇元。二三一號一八三號一五二號二三一號七六號趁低再納，曾回升至五九三〇元。新亞又吿跌停，二二三號九四號二三二號一六號等斬多，臨收時遞永紗亦吿跌停。收後續降至五六五〇元有供，而後略定。結果較前收計永紗信和美亞永公跌停。勤興跌停後小回，與新光景福各跌一成强，新華跌成半弱。遞交計永紗美亞永公跌停，信和跌半成強，新光景福勤興微降。冷股商務獨吿漲停，五和漲停後有瀉，軋跌少許。景綸跌一成，餘股咸吿跌停。</p>
<h3>統債盤升</h3>
<p>公債昨因戰前存款，倍數償還問題，已臨決定之期，人心略好。統丙晨開一六七〇〇元，一一九室四〇八室五五五室有納，盤升至一八三〇〇元。五五〇室二五一室三六〇室逢高了結，最後在一七五〇〇元左右徘徊。結果較前收計甲乙升一千元，統丙漲起一千八，丁升二千一，戊種亦好一千六，成交約七八百萬。</p>
<h3>本市參議員　注意證交動態</h3>
<p>本市參議員陳公達等，昨向市參議會提議撤消證劵交易所以安定人心。連署者達數十人之多。聞一部份議員以爲撤銷似可不必，惟遞交必須停止，因買空賣空，投機性太大，實非目前環境所宜云。</p>
<h3>紡管會今日舉行例會　討論棉紗收購價格</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舫管會已定於今日下午三時，在市府舉行例會，主要議案，仍爲商討棉紗之新議價問題。一俟有所決定，即將送呈中樞當局核定後施行。</p>
<p>按四月份棉紗之收購價及自由買賣議價，因本市六區棉紡公會議價小組會，迄未議出，故中樞當局乃暫先議定廿支標準紗價格每件爲四百六十萬元。此價旣出，各廠以爲按目前棉化價格計算，仍不敷甚鉅。爲維持各廠之再生產前途計，有主張以再生產成本議價。故連日議價小組會雖未正式召開，惟聞民營紗廠方面，經數度洽商，業已獲得新議價方案。以廿支標準紗爲準，每件紗需原棉三担半，每担成本扯一百六十萬元，工繳每件扯一百八十萬元，再加二成合怯利潤，故廿支標準紗每件成本，已在七百五十萬元以上。聞中國紡建公司方面廿支紗生產成本，依該公司目前用棉情形言，三分之一爲外棉，三分之二爲國棉，故原棉成本，每祖約扯一百萬元，工繳每件扯一百廿萬元，再加二成合法利潤，廿支紗每件成本在五百六十萬元以上。故成本價格之產生，實與所採用之原棉價與工繳標準有密切之關係。關係方面人士預測：新議價之產生，勢必在該兩項成本價格中覓具一適度而合理之標準云。</p>
<h3>紗市轉漲布銷仍淡</h3>
<p>昨日紗市反動回升，蓋因紡建開紗，號家額子不多，而每週僅一次，更以銀根略鬆，買戶重形活動，致價挺俏。四十二支藍鳳最後一千二百八十萬元，回漲六十萬元。二十支特雙馬七百十萬，亦好六十萬。其他二十支及十六支均升三五十萬元。</p>
<p>棉布晨開散戶進補四君子金印嗶嘰，各方買意亦濃，價好五千五百元。各檔細布因客胃轉淡，除五福外，餘均下挫五千元至九千元。府綢及漂布實銷呆滯，一致下游五千元許。紡建公司照例供售布疋三十餘種，龍頭細布爲廿六七萬元，印花府綢及蔴紗等限門市店申請，各布號申請不多</p>
<h3>人造絲昂升　廠經綢貨疲弱</h3>
<p>人造絲因配售尙有待，人心仍堅，昨市開盤尙平，一二〇號高山有光先喊買進七百五十萬元，賣出七百八十萬元，後又昂升，最大到八百八九十萬元，卒做八百四十萬元收盤。下午因廠經又吿挫落，故漸呈軟化，最後喊八百萬元收盤，結果較上日大六十萬元。七五號半光筒子貨，二千五百萬元有成交。</p>
<p>廠經各檔喊價，較上日又短四五十萬元，昨有十包交易。E字等級做價一千八百六十五萬元。ABCD等級俱無成交。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市仍形軟弱，大誠被面八百五十萬元做開，較上日短廿萬元。格子　縐最小做三萬〇五百元，最大做二千五百元，最後喊一千五百元賣出，比上日小去一千五百元。</p>
<h3>漢商套購申滙</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕漢口消息，漢市每日流出大鈔頗多，此項大鈔，係流往廣州，套購申匯，在廣州交付七百八十元，上海可支一千元。故每億可獲利二千二百萬元。聞每次搭機飛申提現之往返旅費，祗須二百萬元。因此經營此項套匯者，日見其多。</p>
<h3>民食問題亟待解决　米市塲無形停頓</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先於昨日晋京與糧食部商洽本市民食問題，定週一返滬。屆時當可有新決定。</p>
<p>米市來源未暢，昨到貨仍稀。因日來搶米之風甚烈，米商懼於購米。昨日又均去市府請願，故市塲交易無形停頓，各米號亦多停業。昨南北兩市塲共到貨二一四六石。白粳高貨做廿九萬八，中貨廿九萬。薄稻高貨廿九萬七，中貨廿九萬。早稻高貨廿九萬，中貨廿八萬五。羊秈高貨廿九萬，中貨廿八萬元。碾秈高貨廿七萬，中貨廿六萬，次貨廿四萬五。白元高貨做三十萬五千，中貨廿九萬五，次貨廿九萬。陰元中貨。廿九萬五。</p>
<p>當局配米九千包，昨日原定拋售於北市塲，因各米商齊赴市府請願，故暫停承配。</p>
<p>麵粉市面略有出入，洋粉平平，統粉下跌二三千元，廠方挺秀。麩皮實銷雖動，價格站立。黄豆銷路平常，高定次削，中下回低二三千元。菉豆來去兩少，高貨依然挺進三千元，中次交易淸淡。蠶豆則新陳不接之時，　　甚暢，飛漲萬元。苞米酒精沙化冷懈，狂跌六七千元，紅糧隨之回挫三四千元。生仁外埠本街納胃均淡，步跌萬元，芝蘇少神乏交。油市店方進胃轉强，廠方供源亦見充沛，勢成供求兩旺之局。生油豆油挺升萬元，蔴油亦漲萬元，惟中次生豆油依然平庸，菜油平平。</p>
<h3>茶市又吿淸寂</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市，各種外銷茶，賣方不願輕脫，咸取觀望態度，市勢益形淸寂。至於專供內銷之花色，除珠蘭，大方，微烘等綠茶；天津帮續有沾染外，餘則衹僅零星做開。過程因供求均趨平衡，比前已少起仆。茲據業中人云：目前營口天津等地，對於去年度徽州烘靑，需求頗殷，同時卅五年白琳紅茶，靑島帮亦亟靑睞，惜市上存底，均寥若晨星云</p>
<h3>食糖跌而復升</h3>
<p>昨糖市初以台糖公司已開始復配，趨勢甚軟。秘魯細砂降至三十五萬八千元，後回至三十八萬五千元。二四粗白跌二萬五千元，二〇中砂跌四萬元，四半車白最低不及三十七萬元，三半車白僅三十六萬元，興化白三十六萬元至三十八萬元，亦小二三萬元，興赤廿八九萬元，小一二萬元，台赤廿九萬元，小二萬元，惠州靑廿四五萬元，刁靑呌廿四萬元，未成。及至下午聞台公司配量未能增加，故秘魯細砂復見上展，又出四十萬大關，後市恐未易過鬆。</p>
<h3>零售煤油　改以容量計算</h3>
<p>上海市度量衡檢騐所，以本市煤油業零售商零售煤油，槪以重量計算，爲避免作弊，並期劃一起見，特規定一律改以容量計算，計每聽爲三十市斤，零售用之容量爲一公升，即五百CC，並定於五月底前爲換器時間，所有經營煤油零售商店，應一律於限期內辦理換器手續，該所於六月份起，即將分別檢查，如有故違或延不遵辦，則當照章處罰云。</p>
<h3>道奇卡價騰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕道奇（DODGE）三噸半卡車，自黑市外匯騰升後，價亦隨之上漲，現每輛價需五千餘萬云。</p>
<h3>證劵帮全力斬售外股昨一致下瀉</h3>
<p>外股昨在港申電回升及股市惡化之情况下，北帮及散買之吸納，不敵證券帮全力斬售。錢兌業初進繼出。怡紗晨開八四〇〇〇元，自八五二〇〇起，逐步下游。午後竟以六五〇〇〇元低價結束。各股僅業廣尙無大跌外，幾全部慘降。結果較前收計航業跌二成半，怡紗英聯紙業鋼業各降二成，業廣微挫，餘均下落一成强。</p>
<h3>民用煤如何分配　配給量與申請數相差太遠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民用煤量分配委員會，於昨日下午三時許，在中國銀行大廈舉行首次會議。到燃管會，工商輔導處，警備司令部，社會局，公用局，市商會，工業協會，煤業公會，機製煤球業公會等九單位代表，由燃管會主席徐樂天主席。聞燃管會本月份能撥供民用煤量，計烟煤二萬噸，白煤九千噸。烟煤分配辦法，經劃定民營工廠一萬五千噸，煤業公會五千噸。白煤分配辦法，經劃定煤球業公會六千噸，煤業公會三千噸，惟以各業申請淤，遠逾此數，例如工業協會每月申請量，即達八萬噸。故特以本月份可能撥供民用之煤量，即席公開會商，決定分配辦法云。</p>
<h3>三月份全國行莊　存欵準備統計</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中央銀行稽核處發表全國各行莊存款及準備金總額比較表，三月份之存款總額，計一，一二六，四二九，九〇九，八四四·〇三元，較一月份之六一三，八八九，四九〇，五九五·五〇元，激增數達一倍。較二月份之七五四，〇九二，六九〇，四〇五·九八元，增加將達三分之一。査三月份之存款總額中，活期存款佔一，〇〇八，八六六，三一九，五九〇·七三元，定期存款佔一一七，五六三，五九〇，二五三·三六元，該項存款已繳準備金，爲一六三，三一六，四七七，八三一·一六元。</p>
<h3>原料市況轉堅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕原料市况，前日一度轉軟，昨以港匯再升，再度刺激回堅，賣出者少，價尙難趨小，凡士林及若干冷門原料，以汕，津，廣，等帮吸胃頗強，價再猛挺。</p>
<h3>硫化元　原料外匯分配　商定三原則</h3>
<p>化學原料工業公會昨推派代表王守恒等八人，與輸入臨時管理委員會商討硫化元之原料第二季分配外匯辦法，該代表等當即面陳（一）所配外匯擬交硫化元製造廠，由公會證明及工商輔導處督同，照各廠實際生產情形，合理分配。（二）進口商及外國原料廠可向硫化元製造廠會同公會及工商輔導處，作投標式訂定品價。（三）各廠所產硫化元可交由公會及工商輔導處督同，以合理方式供給染織業及各同業公會會員之需要，但不得售予囤積者，上項三原則准交由輸管諮詢委員會核辦云。</p>
<h3>針織業減工　目前已入淡月</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據針織業中人談：該業近因：（一）黑市紗綫劇烈騰漲，致原料反貴於成品，影響該業生產。（二）中國紡建公司配紗量，僅敷該業實需量三分之一。（三）時令已入淡月，僅汗衫尙稱當令。職是之故，該業自四月份起，已有半數同業，紛紛減工，較原來生產量，約打一六七折之數。據吿：針織業中，以織襪爲大宗。最近一般物價騰漲，該業大路貨卅二支平口中統機，每打似約六萬元，不過恢復至二月中旬時（旺月）之最高價而已。按往年慣例，淸明後農忙季節開始，紗襪即漸趨落令，而近來行市之挺秀，實爲一般物價所帶起。至該業之外銷事宜，刻仍有少數同業從事運營，惟聞大多係從以貨易貨辦法着手，否則，以目前外匯官價與黑市價相差日遠，外銷貿易更難期展開云。</p>
<h3>紙商執貨不售報紙逐步盤高</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕白報紙近日漲勢仍勁，加拿大貨白報紙，每磅已達四千五百元，對開者每令價亦在廿三萬至廿四萬元之間。業中人談：一般紙商爲保持存紙血本，在此物價波動之時，如有售出，勢必先行補進。現因補進不易，故多執貨不售。復以黑市外匯，連續騰漲，故紙價亦逐步盤高。</p>
<h3>製藥業原料分配請交由公會主持</h3>
<p>本市製藥工業同業公會，以轍管會核准購料數額，僅爲六十萬元。距離實際需要，相去甚遠。因於前日下午召開常務會議，由理事長顧克民主席，議決分呈有關機關，所有原料分配與原料指定事宜，概歸公會主持，俾免居問行商剝削侵蝕，並將推派代表，晋見當局，陳述困難云。</p>
<h3>油蠟齊升</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工業油脂，無日不漲，實銷增繁，來貨價高，昨市柏油以漢口匯費須打八三折，再度挺晋，禾本喊八十五萬元，荊柏喊六十八萬元，麻城喊六十六萬元，貨主堅不肯脫，較前月已上漲一倍半。牛油貨主人心挺堅，昨市喊出一百萬關外，無貨可購。椰子油一百廿萬元，略有做開蛟上月四十二萬元，漲達二倍，川臘成皮球貨品，散戶吞吐無常，昨市狂騰至烈，米心大幷每祖已漲至六百萬元。</p>

<h3>灌輸醫學常識的　方式問題（上）</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>在討論灌輸醫學常識的方式這一問題之前，我們首先須得明一下，灌輸醫學常識的意義何在。</p>
<p>爲什麽我們要做這一灌輸醫學常識的工作呢？牠的工作意義在什麼地方？簡單地說：濯輸醫學常識的主要意義，不外乎如下的幾點：（一）把科學新醫中的種種爲大衆所應明瞭的部份，作通俗的宣傳，使他們也明瞭了新醫的價値之後，始易接受新醫的醫療，始能享受到新醫的醫療福利。（二）斜正非科學的醫學觀念，使他們知道過去的舊醫學理，多屬不合科學，醫療的方式，更屬落伍；在此二十世紀的新時代中，在治療上，固不負起醫療的全部職責，在預防上，更談不到爲民衆謀防病保健的偉大任務。（三）使一般向來缺乏醫學常識衛生常識的民衆，獲得應有的日常衛生醫學常識，於未病時有所預防，旣病之後如何處理，如何調養，以達增進個人的生活健康，延長人羣的平均壽命。</p>
<p>這幾點，便是我們所以要做灌輸醫學常識的工作意義了。</p>
<p>然而，我們要達到這一個偉大工作的目的，獲得這項工作的效果，必須要有適當的方法，始有達到的希望，獲得的可能。</p>
<p>於是，我們不能不談論到灌輸醫學常識的方式問題。</p>
<p>這一個醫學常識的灌輸方式適當不適當，合宜不合宜，就是能否達到灌輸醫學常識的偉大目的的關鍵，能否獲得灌輸醫學常識的美滿效果的樞紐。</p>
<p>誠然，灌輸醫學常識，是無絕對的固定方式的；然在大體上或原則上，却應有一個大概的方式才是。</p>
<p>所謂灌輪醫學常識，是指向醫界以外的一般民衆而言；換言之，我們的灌輸工作的目標，是大衆，是一般缺乏醫識的大衆，而非醫界中的醫者。所以，我們在作灌輸工作的時光，千萬勿忘掉，是對民衆說話；也就是我們所提出作為灌輸醫識的題材，要以民衆爲對象；非但要爲民衆所需要，還要佔計到爲一般民衆所能理解，所能溶化才是！</p>
<p>這種旣爲一般民衆所需要，又能爲民衆所理解，所溶化的醫識題材，才可算是合乎灌輸醫識的原則上的方式。亦惟有應用此種合乎灌輸醫識的原則的方式，才能達到灌輸的目的，獲得灌輸的效果咧。</p>
<p>不然，你如果把對於醫界自己的話語，或醫學上專門的題材去向民衆說話，去作一般民衆的灌輸題材，一則，不但非爲民衆所需要，而且也不易爲民衆所理解，所溶化。其結果。非但寫作的人，白費心血，閱讀的民衆，亦枉費了時間，這呌徒勞而無功，吃力不討好。道豈不是與我們原初所預定的宗旨不相符合了嗎？當然更談不到望其達到灌輸醫識的本來目的了。</p>
<p>不久之前，我曾在本刋寫過一篇題爲「醫學上的報紙文章與雜誌文章」的文字。那篇文字的意思，就是說，醫學上的一切文章，在大體上不外乎二類：一類是寫給醫界自己人看的，是屬專門性質的學術文字，這類文字，大多是登載在專門性質的醫學雜誌上的，我假定牠一個名稱，呌做「雜誌文章」；另一類是寫給一般醫界以外的大衆看的，這類供給大衆看的通俗文字，以刊於報紙副刋上，較爲適宜，故我又定牠一僩名稱，呌「報紙文字」</p>
<p>雜誌上，固然不必完全專刋專門性的學術文章，而儘可作爲通俗的醫識文章；然報紙上的醫學文章，惟有適宜於通俗性的醫識文章，要是刊登專門性的學術文章，那就有些不甚相宜了。</p>
<p>現在這兒所說的灌輸醫學常識的文字方式，不消說，是屬於通俗性的報紙文章的一類了。因爲所謂報紙文章，就是寫給一般缺乏醫識的大衆看的通俗文章，其目的，也不出於「灌輸醫學常識」這麽六個大字。</p>
<p>關於灌輸醫學常識的文字方式，或工作目標，應以大衆為對象，須要適合於大衆的口胃，才能收穫得灌轍工作的效果；不然，若將醫界自己討論的醫事文章，或自身用以硏究的學術文章，去向民間去宣傳，對大衆灌輸，惟有白費心血，徒勞而無功。這個，上文已經說過。</p>
<h3>談慢驚風</h3>
<p>— 許樹屛</p>
<p>慢驚風，又稱慢脾驚，這是舊醫所定的病名。提起這個名詞，幾乎無人不知；因爲他是小兒們的勁敵。每年死於此症的，何止千萬！怪不得舊醫見了寒心呢。根據舊說，以爲腹瀉日久可成此病，因內損已甚，胃氣虛弱有以致之。舊醫對於此症，以補脾爲主外，大有束手無策之槪。其實，此病之發生，完全基因於體內水份及鑛物質過份消失之故。凡因嘔吐腹瀉或其他原因而致體內液體减少者，新醫定名爲脫水症Dehydration，這個脫水症，就是慢驚風。脫水的臨床症狀，在嬰兒時間，最爲顯著。他的症狀，（一）皮膚乾燥，失去彈性，在腹部的皮膚，更爲顯著；（二）眼部凹陷，前囱低落；小便减少；（四）神志昏迷，有頸項强直，和驚厥等症狀；（五）呼吸深長如嘆息，這是酸中毒Acidosis的表徵；（六）皮膚口唇或指甲呈靑紫色；（七）體溫可升高至40度左右；（八）體重速减等。關於發生脫水的原理，因屬病理範圍，而非常識範圍，說來話長，姑且從略。洽療原則最重要的，不外乎供給液體，使體內血液的容量，回復常態，血行就可改善，尿量增加，使體內過多的酸性基可與　化合，從小便中掛洩而出，可免酸中毒的發生。對於脫水病原的治療，如傳染病　的除去，實更屬醫師治病的要點。</p>
<h3>向中華醫學會進一言</h3>
<p>— 余正行</p>
<p>中華醫學會第七屆年會，將於五月五日在南京揭幕。這是該會抗戰勝利以後的第一次大會，無疑地，這也是劃時代的年會。因此年會的召開，重心在如何配合建國的歷程，發揮醫學的功能，使中華民國走入富強康樂的坦途。這次年會的使命與任務，本身是艱巨，重大的。因爲在中國的醫學史上，與國家基本國策中，今後應當寫出「公醫制度」的輝煌事跡，而不再爲「交易行爲」的私醫了。所以醫學界本身，如何克服旣往的枷鎖？如何助長公醫制度的成功？如何獻身於民族健康事業？這當然爲醫學會討論的主題，同時決定捨從。現在，謹虔誠的祝頌中華醫學會七屆年會的成功，使能極積促進「公醫制度」早日實現於中國。</p>
<p>屬文於此，使我回憶起三十四年夏天，全國敎育學術團體聯合年會，在重慶北碚舉行的時候。臨閉幕時，有人動議；「年會決議送交敎育部參酌實施者，應予下屆年會報吿施行程度。」議案提出以後，全體一致擁護通過，並即得到會的陳立夫部長允諾執行，彼此保持密切的關係。</p>
<p>這件事發生以後，我感到有此提案，不足爲奇，陳部長樂意接受此提案，亦不足爲奇，而此提案能獲得「全體一致擁護通過。」這却爲奇了，中國許多學術團體，旣往再四標榜，不過問政治，僅僅爲學術而「學術」，這種思想，如不能看爲閉關自守，也不能看爲閉門造車，就多少總有「明哲保身」的味道，也就是說「互不相犯。」這種思想是否仍可存在現社會中，確實値得懷疑。社會愈進化，人與人的關係愈複雜，愈密切，愈難畫分，愈難孤立。第一次世界大戰隔岸觀火的美國，第二次世界大戰居然積極與盟國合作，對抗納拌日寇，瑛在更爲世界的安全與和平，首居領導地位，可證「世外桃源」，「安分是福」的作風與想法，已不吻合現社會實况，希特拉獨裁德國時，德國學者不願爲而爲納粹罪惡的工具，學者安分，野心家不安分，「爲學術而學術」，仍爲幻境！</p>
<p>同時國家關於這一個學術團體的學術施政，這學術團體，不應觀望，應努力同赴。因若由政客把持有關學術的行政，勢必作爲政爭的工具，失敗爲必然的，我們對此，故然歸咎政客的無恥，我們尤應歸咎從事是種學術的人，因循，苟且，敷衍，不積極爭取主動，負起責任，而自己唱着學術的高調，反而讓學術在惡魔的手中撕得粉碎，此時我們爲學術悲，尤爲「行屍走肉」的學術者悲！</p>
<p>前面這種看法，雖是泛泛然而沒有標的，但根據這種看法，證明其思想違反時代，沒有存在的必要，更可作爲現在的借鑑。所以希望中華醫學會第七屆年會中，應對衛生行政有關問題，實際肩負起責任來，醫學界必須積極的負担起民族健康的使命。這不是對事業推行的干預，而是更實際的協助事業的推行。目前，國內的情形來看，未來的衛生部長，一定是個外行，姑不論其能力，若任其「自以爲是」的作，千百年以後，衛生事業不但沒有成就，慢性的退變，恐至滅種絕跡的地步，「公醫制度」毫沒有問題爲一張空頭支票，但唯一的辦法，醫學界應該醒覺而主動，應該站在衛生事業的最前綫。</p>
<p>目前中國是人治的社會，而不是法治的社會，要事業上正軌，合理而有效的推行，當然需要一種力量；這種力量，就是人民大衆。要發揮這種力量，更爲集體行爲的事情，憲法中對衛生政策的　訂，多未恰當，行憲時期，衛生建設，仍一味聽任，未見得能如理想。何况我國公共衛生事業向無基礎，人材缺乏，設備太差。尤有一般人視衛生無關輕重，以醫藥衛生不過淸潔與洽病而已。此種卑劣觀念，主政者每多如此。此種錯誤觀念，實爲衛生事業之當前大敵，不容繼續存在。醫學會應該站在本位立塲，以團體的行動，解救中國國民健康問題，中華醫學會實應担負起這個艱巨的責任。</p>
<p>學術與事業是沒有軒輊的，在學術中發展事業，在事業中精求學術，所以事業的學術是實際的，偉大的。設若單將外國的東西，搬入中國，那只有壯壯觀瞻，對中國人並無補益。最上好的辦法，中國的醫學應配合中國的衛生事業，並肩齊進，硏究中國的醫藥衛生問題，與技術的需要及應用，然後衛生建設才有希望，中國醫學才有進步，否則，中國醫學不是英美的尾巴，便是德日的應聲蟲，所以希望學術不要與實際的衛生事業脫節，而需要密切的步調諧和。</p>
<p>爲了維護並增進全民族的健康，爲了中華醫學光大自立，我要求中華醫學會有一個新的決定，新的作風，要積極的與實際有關的事項，聯接一氣，毫不猶疑的認爲衛生建設是自己責任的一部，衛生行政當局，只不過是代理人，主體還在醫學界。因此，我們要督促，領導，監責衛生行政當局，呌他們能本着「公醫」的精神與本旨，使全中國人民享受到醫藥衛生的實惠，不要使他們「作官」，「發財」，中華　學會應該如此幹，亦唯有如此幹，才能値得人歌頌讚美。否則，照例的開會，決議，宣言，那依然會遭受人們的白眼，鄙視的。</p>
<p>這一點小建議，是由我內心深處發出的，語句措辭，當然有不當的地方，但我却實是深懷善意，希求中國醫學界欣欣向榮，更希望中國人民康壯健强！</p>
<h3>瘋犬病淺說　（續）</h3>
<p>— 陳金斗</p>
<p>我們旣已知道瘋犬病是一種傳染病，那麽是不是被瘋犬（應該統稱病獸）咬了之後，立刻就要發病嗎？不，在咬過之後，沒有開始正式發病以前，其間有一個若無聲色的時期，稱之爲潛伏期（Incubationszeit），這個時期的長短，頗無一定，依一般統計，最短的至少二三個星期，較長的可有半年或者二三年以上的，平均約五六十大之久，被瘋犬咬嚙的時候，倘若沒有他的唾液涎染，就不致於發病；或者被咬傷的地方，沒有侵害到神經，也不大會發病的，因爲淋巴道和血管不是其主要的傳染徑路；夾了衣裳或鞋襪而被咬傷，發病的機會也就減少不少。潛伏期的長短，還隨病獸的種類和咬傷的部位而不同；倘被食肉類動物（如犬狼狐貓）的病獸咬傷，發起病來較快且重，尤其狼咬比狗咬更厲害，這也許爲傷口的大小和深淺有關，假使被同樣的病獸咬傷而得病，那麽被咬傷在手臂部的，其潛伏期要比咬傷在足腿部的短，咬傷在頭面部的，則潛伏期更短，意思就是說咬傷的創口，愈近中樞神經發病也就愈快。至於自身抵抗力的强弱，當然也可影響潛伏期的長短。（未完）</p>
<h3>讀醫師法感言</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓　宋恩灝紀錄</p>
<p>年來息影故鄉，不求聞達，茍全性命，閉戶讀書。日昨上海醫師公會寄來現行醫師法一份，余受而讀之；再拜而言曰：「嗚呼，此即余輩二十年來奔走呼號日夕祈求之醫師法耶？何其令人失望至此也！」請申言之：</p>
<p>（一）違背簡化法令　稽諸外國，凡正式醫校畢業持有國家文憑者，即可向所在地衛生機關請求執照而開業，手續固至簡也。我國則不然，按醫師法：</p>
<p>（一）畢業後，憑畢業文憑，先向考試院請求考試或檢　，頒發及格證書。</p>
<p>（二）憑考試院及格證書，再向衛生署請領醫師證書。</p>
<p>（三）憑醫師證書，再向所在地縣市政府請求登錄，發給開業執照。</p>
<p>手續之繁，開世界各國未有之先例—方今政府提倡簡化法令，此非與之背道而馳，此應商榷者一。</p>
<p>（二）法律不究旣往　本醫師法於卅二年九月廿一日公佈施行，然則在此日以前，凡經政府認可其資格，領有醫師證書之醫師，自無再經考試院考試或檢薂之必要。蓋在同一政府之下，旣經承認於前，不能反齒於後，出爾反爾，失信於民。今本醫師法無明文規定，此豈法律不究旣往之義，此應商榷者二。</p>
<p>（三）產生歧途醫師　我國新醫家之出身有二：一爲學校畢業之正途醫師，一爲非學校畢業之歧途醫師；然此不過一時之過渡現象耳，歧途醫師本不應生生不已。今本醫師法第一條：「中華民國人民經醫師考試及格者得充醫師」，然則無論何人，不須經過學校階段，均可充當醫師，豈非容許歧途醫師源源產生不已，此應商榷者三。</p>
<p>（四）新舊歧等待遇　本醫師法適用於新舊醫師，但待遇似不一律，其第三條第一項：「中醫之曾向中央主管官署或省市政府領有合格證書或行醫執照者」，或第三項：「曾執行中醫業務五年以上，卓著聲望者」，得應醫師檢　。但新醫界中具此兩項資格者，不乏其人，而必須經過醫師考試，同一醫師法中，有此矛盾之點，此應商榷者四。</p>
<p>（五）醫權保障問題　年來醫訟案件，時有所聞，業務糾紛，層見疊出，吾輩所希望之醫師法，在能保障醫權，减少醫訟，本法雖列開業及組織公會之權，而於醫權之條文：如使用麻醉毒品，施行手術，中止姙娠，解剖屍體，鑑定疾病死傷，及最後病診金之保障等問題，似應條分列舉，明文規定，此應商榷者五。</p>
<p>綜觀上論，除第五點外，餘均與醫師考試問題有關。實則考試院若欲伸張其權限於醫界，非不可能；將來實行公醫制度之時，各醫院各階層醫師之任用，及各地衛生機構公務人員之任用，均須借重考試院不可。蓋一方可杜　緣之私，一方可免一派之操縱，法至善也。至若閒業考試，則似有畫蛇添足之嫌，架牀疊屋之雅，且考試舉行，歲有定期，未考試前，不能開業，或謂有臨時執照可以救濟，然臨時執照之發給，亦具有間歇性之特徵，茍非其時，不易領得，　！區區一開業耳，而煩難若此，謂非醫師法之厲階，又將誰咎？</p>

<h3>莫斯科小劇塲回憶</h3>
<p>— 趙景深譯</p>
<p>在高爾基街的一個轉角，普希金與馬耶闊夫斯基方塲之間，那地方常被人稱爲馬門諾夫斯基巷。現在那兒是呌做莎多夫斯基巷。那就是莫斯科尊重我們劇人之家，莎多夫斯基世系——（我的祖父泊魯夫。米海羅夫斯基，我的父親米海爾·泊魯維契和母親婀爾嘉·阿西發薇娜，他們全都是莫斯科小劇塲中的藝術家，這劇塲是俄國最老且亦最有名的。</p>
<p>我在馬門諾夫斯基巷我祖父的老屋裏消磨了我的兒時。事實上，我們從這巷裏常出去玩的地方是皮特浴夫斯基公園，就在城外，我們在那兒有一問小屋。我們這一莎多夫斯基家族從骨髓裏就是莫斯科人，就是有事也不大肯離開莫斯科——例如，甚至到彼得堡去作一短旅行都不願意。你沒有辦法把我們拉出莫斯科。只有在困難的時候，我的母親纔出去旅行。</p>
<p>我們不願意離開莫斯科，我們那奇怪而可愛的城，在那兒任何人都知道任何人。我常趕車到小劇塲去預演或演出，時常揚起帽子，連手臂都舉酸了。</p>
<p>莫斯科的一切都是可愛而且親近的，人民也是一樣，他們過的是古老的生活與習憤，是那樣的令人欣喜。每年習俗要到少女公地去舉行嘉年華會。那兒蓋了草屋，表演着遊藝。有一次我在這種戶外劇塲看到很崇高的戲劇性的演出。這名呌「一八一二，或莫斯科的大火」。我記得，一個人摹仿拿破崙特殊的個性和態度。他穿着綠衣服，戴一頂灰色的三角帽，在台上走來走去。在他那長統靴上面，膨漲起一樣東西，使人猜想，像是襯袴。他把一隻手插在背心裏，另一隻手放在背後。他說出了一句話：「我要到莫斯科去麽？」他用「前進！」一個詞回答了他自己的發問以後，便很快地走下了台。於是藍燄烟火放了起來，算是莫斯科大火。那就是全部的演出。但是，這沒有什麽關係，觀衆還是羣集於這露天的劇塲，非常想念這個劇塲。</p>
<p>後來，我成爲一個演員，常記起道一次的演出和觀衆——人們熱烈地想望着藝術，只能大部分以這種代替品來作爲滿足。</p>
<p>從莫斯科大學到小劇塲只有一箭之地。我們演員常想念到這是接近象徵的。偉大的人文主義者的觀念，鼓舞起莫斯科的敎授與學生們最好與最進步的質地，不是與我們相似麽？</p>
<p>我們偉次的敎師，阿史特洛夫斯基，遠在前世紀的八十年代，就已經寫到眞正人民藝術的需要。我還記得，一九一一年，二月的晚上，忽然好像夢已經現實化了，或者，更眞實的好像人們忽然了解人民劇塲是應該怎樣的。有一次音樂會爾辦蘿娃（Maria　Ermslova）背誦梅可夫（Mailov）一首詩。我想要知道她背誦哪一首詩，對於她的選擇非常驚異。</p>
<p>我問道：「馬　亞。尼可來耶夫娜，你眞的想背誦那苜詩麽？在背誦時是不會有效來的。你爲什麽要這樣做呢？」</p>
<p>爾摩蘿娃只是微笑不答。</p>
<p>她慢慢地走向觀衆。「看哪，微光在那小草屋裏閃　。」她開始用那動人的撫愛的聲音描寫這處景。我們立刻在眼前升起幻象，彷彿一個小農家女走到學校門口，這是她家庭裏第一個進入學校受敎育和文化的人，這教育與文化是必須普及於大衆的。</p>
<p>從第一個字，聽衆便已如被魔術。每一句詩都使得感嘆與然誠增加。後來這位藝術家　到最後兩行：</p>
<p>『弟兄們，相信我，這不過是第一步</p>
<p>進入思想的國土，那兒發出白畫的永久光輝。』</p>
<p>這些字震蕩出來，像是呼喚我們，用藝術來爲人民服務。觀衆熱情地吼呌着，我也在裏面。我一直被震蕩到靈魂的深處。</p>
<p>我想：『是的，我親愛的，那就是你所顯示的偉大的天才—作爲一個人民的戰士。』</p>
<p>最有名的歌者夏里平（Chaliapin）可以成爲人民劇塲的演員，從這名詞最廣泛最民主的意義來說。這位天才藝術家，他那光榮的聲音是與深沈的演技連合在一起的，拋去一切的傳統與細微末節，這些歌劇中所常有的渣滓。從他的嘴唇裏，哪怕是最陳腐的歌曲，唱起來都像是首創的感情的表現。這是在俄國，他的本土，這些觀衆的胃口是他所知道所分享的，所以他纔能達到最偉大和最好的地步。他的移居使得我們大家吃驚。他一離開本土，這曾經使得他的藝術有力而又豐富的本土，他也就不能成為偉大的夏里平了。</p>
<p>在蘇維埃的力量下，我們得到黄金般的機會，可以實現藝術服務人民的企望。新的羣衆到我們這兒來了。這帶來了它的問題</p>
<p>皇家劇院的戲單決定人和經理，都準確地知道羣衆在星期日來看日戲，聚集在樓廳和池子裏；到嘉年華會來看草台戲，塞滿在塲子裏，他們所需要而又喜歡的是些什麼。演員知道，對於某種觀衆是成功的戲劇，也許對於別種觀衆就是失敗的。</p>
<p>莫斯科和列寗格勒的觀衆反映就不同。這一切我們都知道。在我們演出的時候，有一小部分民主的觀劇家，他們想在劇院裏尋求藝術的使命，熱心地聽大戲劇家說話。但大部分擁護我們的觀衆却不管思想的偉大和勇敢，只不過在劇院裏尋找娛樂罷了。</p>
<p>新的時代改變了這一切。民主的觀衆，帶着希望和盼望，塞滿了劇院—池子，包廂和樓廳。觀衆帶着接受的心情和對於人生的淸晰了解，進到戲院裏想看到一點重要的東西。我們應該怎樣迎合上去呢？哪一種戲院纔能使得他們感到興趣呢？</p>
<p>伊里支對余特金（Clara　Zetkin）說：『我們的工人和農人有權利要求比馬戲更高一點的東西。他們有權利要求眞正的藝術。』</p>
<p>我們決定戲碼爲古典劇，排除一切虛偽的和淺薄的。不久以後，我們就演現代劇，到了一九一八年，爲了我們時常找尋的東西，很自然地就找到了高爾基。我們選擇了他的一個戲劇，名呌『老人』。</p>
<p>第一晚我坐在演員室裏，我們的老僕人華西禮衝到幔前來吿訴我，一個男人帶着一個女人進來了，跟隨着一個穿皮背心的軍人。他們放下他們的東西，一直走到導演室裏去。不知道這是怎麽一回事，演出者卜拉東與我走了出去。果然，在前房站着一個軍人。</p>
<p>我們問他：『誰來啦？』</p>
<p>『伊里奇和克魯卜絲卡雅（Nadezhda　Kon　tantinovna　Krupskaya）。』</p>
<p>我們向包廂裏一看。果然伊里支和他的妻子坐在後面一排裏。前面一排已經被卜拉東所許可的人所佔據了。卜拉東走到伊里支面前。伊里支說：『好像我們坐錯了地方。』</p>
<p>卜拉東說：『伊里支，你們的坐位是在那兒。』他指着最好的包廂。伊里支略傾向前，看了看那包廂，便說：『不，我們要在這兒。我們在這兒很舒服。』</p>
<p>卜拉東問：『我們呌坐在你前面的人移到別的包廂去好麽』</p>
<p>『不，爲什麽呢？這沒有需要。不要操心了。我們在這兒很舒服。』</p>
<p>莫斯科重建得更加美麗。有時，像我這樣的老莫斯科，却也不捨得離開那狹窄，彎曲小街屋，因爲它們留存着許多記憶。但我離聞酣睡的老莫斯科這舊世界的先人遺產，並不曾掉一滴眼淚。我看見了偉大的重建國都的計畫又已有了生命。</p>
<p>我說，今日的莫斯科已經成爲劇塲的聖地，當離眞實不太遠。在宴會的時候，國內各地的資客都到我們這兒來。幾乎各國的藝術家都來拜訪我們。</p>
<p>有一個時期布爾旭劇院把舞台讓給我們的賓客，展覽了奇怪的東方服裝，震響着遙遠的高加索與外蒙古平原不知名的樂器。</p>
<p>在那些時候我們聽了烏士俾克（Vzbek）語的『阿寨羅』，看見人物所賦與的生命，更無須文字來了解他。這種崇高的原始文化滋富了我們的藝術，道是多末偉大的交流呵，我們的觀衆是多末的熱烈地接受它呵！</p>
<p>就在小劇塲附近，豎立了一位俄國大戲劇家阿史特洛夫斯基的紀念碑。他坐在圍椅裏，靠近我們的續，彷彿靜聽大城的低吟，新時代的音樂，在他的心裏激動了思潮。每一次我走進戲院，總要託帽向那黄銅的阿史特洛夫斯基致敬，彷彿他還活着一樣。</p>
<p>他看見小車的行列經過他面前，該是多末的驚訝呵！原來我們出發到國內各地旅行去。我幻想他在那兒想：</p>
<p>『我那小劇塲要無休止地發展到什麽地步呢？它要擴展到什麼地方去呢？』</p>
<p>我吿訴他說：『到列寗格勒的文化之宮去——到基輔，到敖得　，到聶伯羅皮特羅夫斯克，到哈科夫，帶着全劇團的人去，還有一切的佈景，以及你那黄金的言語，親愛的亞歷山大·尼可拉葉維契呵！』（蘇聯·莎多夫斯基Prov　Sadovsky作）</p>
<h3>遠嶺黃昏（水彩）</h3>
<p>— 周斯達</p>
<h3>烏鴉　外二題</h3>
<p>— 許小花</p>
<p>田園</p>
<p>你相信現在世界上有世外桃源麽？以及絢紅的迷人的桃花？那是夢幻，不兌現的縹渺的夢。</p>
<p>時代不同，它在前進：武陵漁人的遁世的企求，是沒落，萎縮，徬徨，悲哀的綜合啊！</p>
<p>『田園寥落干戈後，』不幸得很，除了烽火和飢餓，還有什麽値得讚美的？有許多人在雙重威脅下死亡，有人在骷髏堆裏抬黄金；不過，這比例是太懸殊了。……</p>
<p>那汜濫的河水，血紅的砲彈，空的穀倉，瓦爍的灰堆，……在大風砂的關外，高梁漫野（可惜土地多半空了呵！）的北國，草長鶯飛的江南，……都逃不了烽烟或飢餓的厄運。</p>
<p>我問你：世外桃源在那裏呢？</p>
<p>傷逝者</p>
<p>悲哀，憤懣，大聲的抗議，交織着一個孤獨而倔强的生靈。</p>
<p>『自殺是懦弱的表現，』我爲死者流涕，更爲生者寄於無限的期望。別嗤它是老生常談，眞理也就在裏面啊！</p>
<p>舊的反動的定將沈淪，沒落，但還沒有澈底摧毁，新的前進的必將升起，但還沒有偷快的降臨人間。</p>
<p>這是一段黎明前的黑暗，新生命降生前母體的陣痛！</p>
<p>伐木者把林中的幼苗一枝枝割下，這森林也快變成平地了；</p>
<p>一個個沒有十分豐滿的生命，給豺狼的遺產，在四更天倫偸吞噬了，我悲憤，但更增强堅定的信心。</p>
<p>—使弱者鍛鍊爲堅强，在光亮前多播種新生的種子。</p>
<p>烏鴉</p>
<p>天快黑了，烏鴉畫在　頂上打旋。</p>
<p>『哇哇哇，』這是對善良者威脅的呌聲，麻雀聽了遠遠地飛走了，牠們得意的笑。</p>
<p>『我們是勝利了，弱小的傢伙！』</p>
<p>天上眞的是烏鴉曰一般黑麽？不是的：在牠們盤旋以外的天空，還是胥的一大片。</p>
<p>太陽躱在山背後，烏鴉一隻隻在暗夜裏胆怯，飛回牠們的老家去了。</p>
<p>明天是晴天哪。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　504</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這種種問題，當然都像亂絲般的一團糟，積縱在鶴見心上。如今雖說有了這許多人帮忙，比敎他合正岩二人，形單力薄，　摘了頭的蒼蠅一般瞎闖，當然要穩扎得萬倍。况且，如今萍子的下落，也有了些　目；那封神秘的信件，也有人答應可以試行詮釋，鶴見當然可以放心不少。不過，話娥如此，萍子是否竟能從匪窟救出？是否確定萍子必在這三個「窩子」之一裏？換句話是否對方絕不會把萍子放在三個「窩子」以外任何地方？並且，照韓方代表所說，對方佈置的「警戒綫」十分厚實，這邊派人去救援，雙方當然免不了一番激鬥，這邊四方而同去的結合陣綫，也當然可以與對方對拼一下，問題却是，萬一敵方在失敗的時候，照日人素來下作心理來看，也許竟下毒手把萍子一槍了結，那又怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>况且，到了夜半十二時以後，萍子設若未能援救出來，就說有覺T老人把秘密命令詮釋出來，鶴見獨自一人，是否能够照命令執行，不也是一個大問題嗎？那就是說，沒有萍子，鶴見本人，能够獨力撼負執行嗎？縱然這裏使倖有另外三方面同去帮忙，能力固然極強，但却決定不是萍子一類性質的能力，可以斷言。到那時，縱令三方面都願犧牲一切，孤注一擲，叵奈路數不對，使不上氣力，豈非白費？</p>
<p>所以說，鶴見收到各方面電話之後，雖說放心一半，然因想到其他這兩三個可慮的困難問題，心下究竟難以坦然自在。這時，　見獨自一人，關在這大旅社的房產裏，只有兩件大事可辦：一，照他的老習慣，又起手來，在房間空處，往來　　；二，一來一往的當口，幾乎每踱一步，必得瞧瞧門邊牆上那架電話，希望外面有電話進來。</p>
<p>鶴見正在這種焦煩的當口，忽然聽得門上剝剝敲了兩下，敲得十分之輕，就像一隻小啄木鳥，在門上啄了兩下似的，鶴見聽了道敲門聲普，立即停步。因爲不曾聽眞是否眞的有人敲門，也還沒來得及答應，門上又是剝剝，剝剝，四下。這四下分作兩回，兩下之後，間歇一下，又是兩下。</p>
<p>「誰？」鶴見有些奇怪：要說是本旅社侍應，有事入室，決不能這樣拿指田尖啄門。說是已經來過的守一等人之一，一面敲門，也許不等裏面答應，早已推門而人；無論如何，再也不會敲得道般輕，並且又敲得這等神秘；先是兩下，過後又是兩下的兩下，聽去好像某種約定的暗號似的。再說，如若這敲門的人，是一個面生的人，旅社必是照例派侍應領導上樓，而且事前，必有電話先行通知，問明是否願意接見。如今這種敲門方式，似乎不在這三處範車之內；所以鶴見復覺奇怪地問「誰？」</p>
<p>剝剝，……剝剝，……剝剝！……</p>
<h3>一個徵婚啓事</h3>
<p>— 卜束</p>
<p>中央大學四年級學生某，近在大剛報上刋一啓事，徵求孀婦爲妻，不計其他，但望供給學費。</p>
<p>這是都市麽華現象下的沉浮，經近一兩年來的「高物價」這根棍子一攪動，於是就浮了起來，皇皇然以「社會問題」的面目公開出現了。有人說這是男妓的變態，是跪在阿堵物面前叩頭乞命的可憐蟲的化身，語雖刻薄，然而多少道出了一點眞實。</p>
<p>可以想像得到的，一看到這啓事，道學先生又將搖頭興歎了，然而這年頭可嘆的事情太多，　得記「黄色新聞的專家」們振筆疾書的新聞也太多，總有一天，由於「入芝蘭之室，久而不閔其香」的緣故，一切奇離古怪的事情也將失去他的感染性了。</p>
<p>在大學裏，固多西裝革履，用錢闊綽得很的人，然而，更多的是終年老穿着一　補釘長衫的窮學生，這情形也反映出整個社會的面影，本是極平常的，然則在這拜金主義的社會裏，「徵求孀婦爲妻」又有什麽可怪呢？可怪的是他的徵求目的——「但求供給學費」。一個旣已服齊拜金主義的人，一個屈服於現實的殘酷的人，一個企圖以婚娶的方式來　得學費的人，他居然還想繼續求學，這就太慘了。</p>
<p>法國A·紀德能從一個在路上埋頭走過的老人身上，想像出這老人的遭遇和厄運來。有人也敢爲刋登這則啓事的窮大學生的遭遇想像一下麽？隱藏在這啓事後面的，也可能是一齣大悲劇，一個大痛苦。</p>
<p>——這是拜金主義盛行的社會裏的拜金鏡頭之一，善男信女不妨正眼瞧瞧　！</p>
<h3>糖與烟</h3>
<p>— 以權</p>
<p>卜束先生談起美國人在過去十個月中，共消耗糖果費五萬萬餘元；我以爲這費用並不大，我們可以將它分拆一下：美國人口約一萬萬人，平均每人在十月中消耗糖果費値五元，即每人每月消耗糖果値五角，合法幣六千元。一個最起碼的上海市民，每月消耗糖果六千元，我想沒有一個人會說他浪費的。的確，美國人比國人節儉。再回顧上海，一擲百萬金的高等華人，他們每月的花費，如果將它統計一下，那才令人咋舌呢！又何必請人家嘴裏少甜一點，讓自己人一擲百萬金？再進一步說，如果丢開糖果不談，卜束先生如果有空，不妨請將上海人每月香烟消耗量統計一下：假設三百五十萬上海人中有五十萬人抽煙，每人每天消耗捲煙二十支，每二十支以平均數二千五百元計，這數目恐怕亦不在小吧！而且美國人所消耗的糖果，其中百分之九十九是他們本國產，國人消耗的香烟有一半以上是外國貨，中國貨中有大半是外國人在中國設廠的出品。嗚呼！夫復何言！</p>

<p>第二次市府交響樂在五月十一日仍在蘭心戲院公開演奏。這一次有很好的節目——開頭是罷哈阿勃爾脫的Praeludium．Choral　and　Puga…Bach-Abert。第二一，是潑賽爾的組曲弦樂合奏Suite　from　the　Dramatic　for　strings　only。第三，是哈登Hayan的第四交響曲Symphony　No．4　in　D　major（The　Clock）。哈登是古典派的重要人物，他對於後來的交響樂有很大的貢獻。其作品以精雅流利見長。關於奏鳴曲及絃樂四重奏也有很好的作品。但是最多的乃是交響曲，據說有一百幾十種之多，最者名的衹有十二種。第四個節目是聖賞的大提琴協奏曲Sait-Saens：First　Concerto　for　Cello　with　Orchestra。大提琴獨奏者，希夫磋夫Shevtzoff。聖賞也是善於器樂作品的，他是近代法國有名的作曲家，協奏曲的好處就是有獨奏可聽，同時也有管弦樂可聽，是雙方並重的。第五是立阿杜夫的八曲俄國民歌Liadow：Eight　Russian　Folk-songs：（一）宗敎歌Sacred　Song，（二）聖誕曲Koliada（Chrismas　Carol）（三）悲歌Lament，（四）滑稽歌Comic　Song：I　Have　Dancek　with　a　Gnat，（五）島歌The　Legend　of　the　Birds，（六）搖　曲Luilaby，（七）圓舞Round　Dance，（八）舞曲Dancing　Chorus這猶如八幅小畫片。</p>
<p>這一個節目包括了幾種樂曲；大的有交響曲，小的有民歌。演奏方面有獨奏，弦樂合奏和管弦樂；是一個很好的音樂會。節目的安排和指揮是　利國敎授Arigo　Foa。</p>
<p>上一次的客滿，退出了許多後到的人，所以這一次　當　一些去買票，比較妥當些。</p>
<p>新知識</p>
<h3>改造人格的新醫術</h3>
<p>— 建華</p>
<p>醫學，也和別的自然科學一樣，日新月異，確有顯著的進步，據最近研究，人的性格，可偕用醫術，改造其本質，使人類日到進化。</p>
<p>內分泌腺，與人體的構造有關，已成不能否定的事實。由於內分泌腺發育的程度，而呈現各個人不同的性格，圾近也由醫學界予以證實。譬如甲狀腺異常發達的人，鼻樑必高，屬色必白，操事不易疲勞；又如乙狀腺發達的人，頭腦必冷靜，心術多機祚。這種實騐，現在新醫學上往往可從內分泌腺的如何發育，十九可以斷定其人的性格。</p>
<p>但是不良的人格，新醫術已能矯正。如果內分泌腺過於發育，可用一種光綫使其縮小；如果內分泌腺發育衰弱，可用由內分泌腺所製的針劑，爲之添補。因此，美國人　於這個改造人格的見解，正在圖謀將兇惡罪犯的惡性改善。據說日本罪犯中，有五分之一，都屬「胸腺淋巴體質」，這種體質，因爲生時存在於胸部的胸腺，長成時並不消失，（凡人長成時，胸腺必即消失）殘留體內，使人常起變態性慾，尤當各種野心，容易自殺，也敢於殺人，此種劣性，除新醫術外，敎育是無能爲力的。</p>
<h3>竊犯竟是專家</h3>
<p>— 幾幹</p>
<p>本市虹口警察分局最近拘獲一個盜車案犯調査之下，竟是一位機械專家。、身懷絕技，海外歸來，因爲一時求職困難，就淪爲小偸。看了這段消息的人，恐怕沒有不覺得惋惜的。</p>
<p>這樣的人，我們不信社會上已經過剩，致使他無法找到職業。在專家太多的美國也許可能，在中國決無其事。此人之所以找不到職業，還在於我們這個社會組織，不够嚴密，遂使一個有用的人，不能走到適合他並且需要他的位置上去。現在我們固然已有若干負責介紹職業的團體，可是一般廠家商號和機關，還不大知道如何去利用，他們忽視了這種介紹的重要。然而他們聘用人員的方法，還是沒有脫離介紹的階段。不過此種介紹乃是範圍狹小的私人介紹而已。從人才的網羅上講，其問實有極大的不同。</p>
<p>如果不用介紹，就應該用考試的方法。這是比介紹更妥善的用人之道，中國昔日的科舉制度至今還有人識美者，就是考試之中的一點挑選人才的作用。它給那些朝中無人的人們一個登用的機會。現在採用考試制度以用人的機關固然逐漸增加，可是究竟還不多。於是一個有能力的失業者，遂不免感到投奔無路之苦，在生活前熬之下，意志比較薄弱的人就饑不擇食了。像這個盜車的專家便是一個例。</p>
<p>我們不能否認此人本身也有缺點，如報導上說他「平時涉足妓院」，「不圖上進」，就是墮落的根源。古人說「無欲則剛」，這個靑年在花叢之中來去自然挺不起腰來，要屈服在黑暗勢力之前。然而我們想一想他「年僅二十七歲」，抗戰前後十年之中恐怕未必受到什麽敎育，學識與修養也許始終停頓在十七歲上，甚至比那個少年還退步了，就應該看出社會對他實在負着相當責任。此番幸而他被捕了。我們希望除了繩之以法之外。能將社會欠他的敎育補償給他，那就不單是他一個人的益處了。</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>××戰區司令部的一批軍車——五輛三噸半的卡車——昨天照例沒有開走。公路的車子，說明天開的，最快總得後天開，這是公式；這幾天逃難雖然要緊，老脾氣還是改不掉。反正來回白跑，倒霉的是搭車的人，誤不了他們司械老爺的事。</p>
<p>車子原說停在環湘東路，可是一兩百位搭車的人從淸早五六點鐘起，恭候到中午十二點鐘，連車輪也沒有見到。</p>
<p>「車子今天沒有修好，明天開！」好容易盼望到走來兩個穿着草黄色卡其布夏威夷衫和同色長褲的司機模樣的人，聽到了這兩句輕描淡寫的話？</p>
<p>「明天是不是一早開？」「車子停在那兒？」「還是這兒嗎？」客人紛紛發出例有的詢問，然而那兩個人却只是傲然地回答：</p>
<p>「你們明天早一些來候就是了！」</p>
<p>再想問下去時，他們已不　不踩，揚長而去了；有幾個機靈的人忙着趕上去，敬香烟，邀吃飯的急忙跟他們聯絡起來。</p>
<p>「他媽的！這些混蛋！」張昌和好幾個年靑的劇人都忍不住這樣大駡着，然而車子不來又有什麽辦法呢？結果也不能和別人一樣的抗着箱籠行李，沒精打采的走回去。老祝是領隊，回去之後，當然不能像別人一樣的罵罵街就完事；他還得硬着頭皮，再上交通處去找熊處長，化了足足半天工夫的交涉，這樣才能使他在隔夜就問了開車的時間和停車的所在。</p>
<p>今天已是當局宣佈第二次緊急疏散令的前夕了，慌亂的人羣在街上來來去去的奔馳着，擠挨着；原來不打算走的土著的廣西人也給惡化得那麽快的局勢哧壞了，　江兩岸讓他們擠得像砌了人　一樣、都是想搭木船逃往　山一帶山區去的。</p>
<p>新中國劇團的全體人馬是在天未明前就開到南門外的飛機塲門口的，五輛軍車也早在那裏等着了，有兩個穿着極骯髒的軍衣的兵士在看守，像是駕駛兵的下　。祝兆年把交通處出的乘車證遞給他們，以爲可能再有留難，可是那兩個兵連看也不看，只點了點頭，便伏在地上，繼續用拾來的枯枝烹煮他們的早餐。（六七）</p>

<h3>National Army from Suiyuan Moves South to Aid Shanxi; Fierce Fighting in Suburbs of Wubao, Shaanxi; Mopping-Up Operations Underway in Hua County and Daokou Area, Henan Province</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] The communist army is threatening Taiyuan from four directions. The communist vanguard on the eastern route is 60 li east, while the main force is east of Yuci. The vanguard on the northern route has already captured the Nan Doulou and Pingshe stations south of Xinxian, while the main force is in a stalemate with the National Army defending Xinxian. The central and western routes are currently deadlocked in Gucheng. The communist army on the southern route is attempting to concentrate its main force to capture Yuci, cutting off the Datong-Puzhou (Tongpu) and Zhengding-Taiyuan (Zhengtai) railway intersection and isolating Taiyuan. Fenyang is under attack from three sides, and Xianglezhen on the Pingyao-Fenyang highway has been captured. Except for the east, the communist forces surrounding Taiyuan are still 80 li away. In recent days, refugees have concentrated in Taiyuan, reaching over 100,000. Prices are soaring. The current population of Taiyuan is approximately 200,000, not including armed forces.</p>

<p>[Our Gui Sui Dispatch, 7th] Kang Jianmin's troops were driven out of Suiyuan by the National Army on the morning of the 7th and fled southwest from Shahu Kou into Pinglu County, apparently heading for Kelan. It is reported that Kang's troops entered Suiyuan last month with 1,200 men. This time, they left Suiyuan with only 400 men. Besides the 400 men assigned to Yun Ze in northern Chahar, the rest were annihilated by the National Army. Furthermore, most of the communist troops in Xingxian have been transferred to the Zhengtai line to besiege Taiyuan. Shuoxian and Pinglu have become empty cities. The 12th War Zone troops are advancing south along the Tongpu line to relieve the siege of Taiyuan.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 8th] The communist army in Wubao, Shaanxi, is holding firm. However, a large fire was seen in the city yesterday. The two armies were still engaged in fierce fighting in the suburbs yesterday morning. The two armies in Mizhi north and south have been engaged in repeated seesaw battles. Reports that Panlong in northern Yan'an had been captured by the communist army are inaccurate. The National Army in that area captured Yongpingzhen yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 8th] During the battle of Panlongzhen in northern Shaanxi on the 4th of this month, the communist army suffered heavy casualties, with corpses scattered everywhere.

<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 8th] After the mopping-up campaign by the National Army moving south between Baoding and Shijiazhuang temporarily came to an end, part of the corps on both flanks was transferred north. Tension has risen again on both sides of the Pingbao Railway. The two armies have been engaged in continuous back-and-forth battles in the Mancheng and Wanxian areas, with heavy communist casualties. Today, the National Army compressed and pursued the west, and 3,000 troops from the communist Cheng Shaofu's unit retreated to west of Mancheng, where they are engaged in intense fighting. On the morning of the 8th, communist forces simultaneously attacked the outposts of Suncun and Zhongran on the outskirts of Baoding, but were defeated and retreated south at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 8th] The National Army in Xincheng on the eastern side of the Pingbao Railway has launched attacks for several days, mopping up the remaining communist forces on the border between Xiong and Ba. Yesterday, they encountered over 1,000 communist troops. The battle situation was fierce in the area 28 li east of the city and is still ongoing. External rumors that over 10,000 troops from the communist Ma Hui's unit were besieging Xincheng have been denied by officials.</p>
<h3>Situation in Northeast China Gradually Becomes Active</h3>
<p>Communist Army Engaged in Open and Covert Struggles Between Three Factions</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th] The situation in Northeast China is gradually becoming active due to the communist army's new attempts. Over 10,000 communist troops were transported from Qiqihar to Dalai on the 27th of last month. Currently, approximately 90,000 communist troops from eight divisions are concentrated in that area and the area around Qian Gorlos Banner, equipped with over ten tanks, attempting to attack east along the Changbai Railway. On the Liaodong front, troops from the communist 2nd Military Sub-district and the Independent 3rd Division, etc., infiltrated south from the area east of Dongfeng on the 5th towards the area south of Xi'an, with part of their forces sabotaging the railway. Their intention is clearly to prelude an attack on the Chinese Changchun Railway in Sipingjie. In addition, 30,000 communist troops have been transferred from Jiahe to Lafa, two-thirds of whom are Korean, commanded by Zhou Baozhong, who claims to be attacking Laoye Ridge, but it seems that Yongji is the focus of their attack.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The communist army in northern Manchuria has become increasingly chaotic internally since Lin Biao's death. Based on opinions from various sources, it can be divided into three factions: (1) those who advocate restoring peace talks with the government to resolve all problems politically; (2) those who advocate continuing to resist the government through attack and defense, achieving the goal of national betrayal by force; (3) those who advocate immediately laying down their weapons and surrendering to the central government. The three factions are unwilling to yield to each other and are engaged in open and covert struggles, making the situation extremely serious.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Retreating from Mengcheng Flees in Separate Groups, Causing Disturbances</h3>
<p>Representatives from Anyang Arrive in Zhengzhou to Seek Assistance</p>
<p>[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 8th] Zhang Taisheng's troops, retreating from Mengcheng, have scattered and fled in separate groups.

According to a State Department bulletin issued on the 7th of this month, lend-lease materials are valued at approximately US$1.5 billion, and surplus materials are valued at approximately US$900 million. However, according to the announcement of our government, the US estimate of lend-lease materials is too high. The Executive Yuan will organize a Lend-Lease Materials Liquidation Committee to collect relevant data in order to present accurate figures for formal negotiations with the US. A meeting of officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of National Defense, and other relevant departments will be convened on the morning of the 9th to discuss the organization and liquidation methods of the committee. Wang Shoujing, chairman of the Chinese Supply Committee in Washington, has returned to China from the US upon summons and arrived in Nanjing on the 8th to report everything to the government and participate in the liquidation work. Also, according to news, surplus materials valued at approximately US$900 million by the US side have been decided to be sold to China for US$210 million in accordance with the Sino-American Agreement on the Sale of Surplus Materials. Of this amount, US$120 million will be allocated to repay the wartime US military expenditure advances in China, and the remaining US$90 million will be paid by the Chinese government in Chinese legal tender of US$55.5 million, with the remainder being used as funds for US cultural and educational programs in China. Note: The wartime US military expenditure advances in China totaled over 20 billion yuan in national currency before 1944, which was converted by the US side into US$255 million at the beginning of 1945 and allocated to our foreign exchange fund. The total amount of our advances from 1945 to the end of August 1946 was 130 billion yuan in national currency. This advance will be thoroughly cleared in this negotiation.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] Columbia University law professor Chamberlain, recently commented on the reorganization of our government and the new constitution passed last December, saying that the Executive Yuan has the great power to decide administrative policies and initiate legislation, which allows leaders of minority parties to jointly determine the path of the future government.

<h3>Remuneration for Public Servants and Teachers to be Adjusted Soon; Measures for Unfreezing Cost of Living Index Still Under Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The adjustment of remuneration for public servants and teachers will be realized in the short term. Relevant parties are currently compiling tables overnight, and all work can be completed within days. It is reported that someone once suggested that adjustments should not be divided by region in the future, but it was ultimately decided to calculate them by region. As for the multiplication factor, it is heard that some advocate increasing it by a factor of one, but the actual adjustment number in the future may not exceed 50%. Furthermore, regarding the adjustment of remuneration for military personnel, Director Zhang will make an explanation at the Central Political Council meeting next Monday.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Measures for unfreezing the cost of living index were discussed further on the 8th at a meeting convened by Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, with relevant agencies, and will be studied again at the Executive Yuan's policy review meeting to be held on the morning of the 9th, before being submitted to the Price Committee for approval on the 10th. Currently, it is possible to decide that wages below 30 yuan will be calculated at 15,000 times, and wages above 30 yuan up to 210 yuan will be divided into eight levels, with each level decreasing incrementally, but the final decision will depend on the measures in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Capital Escapes to Macau</h3>

(2) The people will block Macau and cut off its material supplies. (3) Military action. The people will circle one item, send it to the association, and publish it ten days later.</p>
<h3>Repaying Pre-War Deposits</h3>

<h3>Military Supplies Buried in the Mountains of Eastern Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hualien Port, 8th] It is widely rumored here that when Taiwan was recovered, the Japanese army buried many military supplies in the mountains of eastern Taiwan, especially near Tongmen Village in the mountains of Hualien Port. Currently, several large tunnels near Tongmen have been covered and are strongly constructed, which is suspicious.

<h3>Mo Dehui Will Go to Taiwan Today; To Visit Zhang Xueliang in a Private Capacity; Chairman Gave a Gift and Asked Mo to Take It</h3>
<p>[Our News] State Councilor Mo Dehui arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday and will take the Zhongxing ship to Taiwan this morning. Mo told reporters before his departure: "This trip is entirely in a private capacity to visit Mr. Zhang Xueliang. I have no other mission; because my last meeting with Mr. Zhang was as far back as my trip to Guizhou last April. However, the fact that the Central Government has approved my visit is enough to show the government's concern for Zhang. I have not visited Taiwan since its recovery, so I will try to travel as much as possible and rush back to attend the Senate meeting before the 20th." Mo did not want to comment much on the situation in Northeast China, but pointed out that the reception of Dalian is still a problem. This elder statesman of the Northeast believes that "the scientific and peaceful unification of our country must be realized as soon as possible, and democratic constitutionalism must be established as soon as possible," and said: He has strong confidence in this, but declined to express the method to achieve this goal, believing that every citizen has the responsibility to study it.</p>

<h3>Zhang Boling Arrives in Beijing from Ping; Immediately Visits the Office to Transfer to the Capital to Attend the Political Consultative Conference; And Negotiates with the Ministry of Education to Expand Nankai University</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 8th] Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University, arrived in Ping from Tianjin this morning and is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 10th and then proceed to the capital on the 15th to attend the Political Consultative Conference. According to Zhang, Nankai's rehabilitation work is now fully in place. The enemy's occupation of Tianjin caused the most severe damage to Nankai, but the buildings that could be used have been repaired. The biggest shortage is in books and instruments, but the library of the Institute of Economic Research fortunately escaped damage and has been transported from the south to Tianjin. This year, the Ministry of Education allocated 1 billion yuan for expansion and improvement, but the amount for adding equipment is still small, and more professors are urgently needed, as well as fundraising for construction. The current plan is to use 800 million yuan to build seven large buildings for use as a library and auditorium. The foundation of the engineering college is already in place, with departments in chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. This time, negotiations will be held with the Ministry of Education to formally establish the engineering college. Zhang continued that with soaring prices, public and educational personnel are barely "not starving to death," and the Political Consultative Conference should study this issue in detail. However, the severity of the price increases has not yet reached the point of economic collapse. The country's future is very bright because: (1) there is no international oppression, and (2) there is a wise leader leading the country towards democracy. Zhang spoke about the lives of professors, saying, "We must be patient to find a way out, as the country is paying a great deal in education expenses."</p>
<h3>Standing Committee Meeting of the Political Consultative Conference</h3>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Will Hold a Special Meeting Today; Jiang Yuntian Will Propose Abolishing Foreign Exchange Controls</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 8th] Jiang Yuntian, a political affairs committee member of the Democratic Socialist Party, will suggest to the Executive Yuan on the 9th that it reform China's current economic policies, including abolishing foreign exchange controls, using excessive profits from basic commodity transactions to subscribe to public bonds and treasury bills, and restricting loans from government banks. Jiang declined to predict how the Executive Yuan would consider this plan or what chance it would have of being adopted, saying only that he had discussed the plan with other political affairs committee members, who did not express an opinion but suggested that he submit it to the Executive Yuan in writing. The Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold a special meeting on the 9th to discuss the current economic crisis. The proposal to abolish foreign exchange controls does not change the current measures regarding the use of foreign exchange. Jiang believes that the current foreign exchange controls are not only useless but also harmful to the government. The drawbacks are that while they may encourage imports, they hinder exports and overseas remittances, both of which cause the government to lose a large amount of foreign exchange. Jiang believes that abolishing foreign exchange controls and having the Central Bank post daily rates based on market conditions will revive export trade and encourage the inflow of overseas remittances. Jiang acknowledged that this move would have the opposite effect on imports but insisted that what China urgently needs is foreign exchange, not foreign goods. Regarding the second point of his proposal, the aim is to absorb idle funds. Jiang said that the past gold policy had failed and that the results of public bond sales were also poor. To encourage subscription to bonds and treasury bills and absorb idle funds, he suggested using excessive profits from basic commodities, such as rice, flour, cooking oil, etc., to subscribe to bonds. Profits refer to what remains after deducting costs, transportation, and taxes. A certain percentage of these profits would be used to purchase bonds. He advocated that 50 percent of the profits be considered excessive profits, but this figure does not necessarily have to be discussed by the Executive Yuan. Regarding the third point, Jiang believes that whether government or private banks should only grant loans to productive enterprises, and their products should only be major commodities to which the excessive profit rule can be applied. The government can thus easily control the production of goods and the use of loans. Jiang believes that the current sharp rise in prices is not just a matter of supply and demand but is caused by idle funds. He also said that during the civil war, even stopping the printing of new banknotes would not control speculation.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Arrives in the Capital in Response to a Summons; Rumored to Be Going to the United States to Discuss a $500 Million Loan; Marshall Claims the Spending Plan Has Been Approved</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Finance Minister Song Ziwen arrived in the capital from Shanghai at approximately 2 p.m. on the 8th in response to a summons from the Chairman. It is rumored that this trip is related to the $500 million loan from the United States, as the United States has stated that if China does not submit a plan to use the loan before June 30, it will be canceled. Song will fly to the United States in the coming days, but whether he will request an extension of the loan can only be decided after arriving in the capital.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 8th] It is rumored that Song Ziwen will go to the United States as a special representative of Chairman Chiang to negotiate the $500 million loan designated for China by the Export-Import Bank. This news has not yet been confirmed by senior authorities here.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] Marshall stated that he believes the recent expansion of the Chinese government is a step towards accepting the conditions for American financial assistance. He cautiously added that the effectiveness of the reorganization remains to be seen. Marshall said at a press conference that he knew most people had suggested forming a coalition government and that Premier Zhang Qun was a friend he greatly admired. He hoped that the reorganized Chinese government would do its best in its constructive work to move towards a truly representative government. Marshall also announced that the State Department has approved several plans for the Export-Import Bank loan, but so far, he has not been successful in handling the necessary credit loans. The following plans have been approved: (1) repairing the Canton-Hankou Railway, (2) developing the Tanggu port facilities; (3) small cotton loans, (4) rebuilding the Yellow River Railway Bridge. Marshall continued that even before he left China, he had hoped to obtain some funds to complete the above construction projects and other similar projects that he considered extremely important for the recovery of the Chinese economy. He emphasized that he had requested to witness China begin its construction plans. When a reporter asked him whether the application period for the $500 million loan designated by the Export-Import Bank would be extended beyond the June 30 deadline, he said that this issue would be decided by the National Foreign Loan Advisory Committee, of which the State Department is also a member.</p>

(2) There have been revisions to loans for export materials and mortgages on daily necessities. The "Measures for Relaxing Mortgage Loans Handled by Grain Banks and Bureaus" and the "Measures for the Central Bank to Handle Re-pledges and Re-mortgages of Loans for Export Materials" previously formulated by the Four Joint Offices have been revised due to changes in the current economic situation. Among them, the limit for each bank and bureau to report after the fact has been increased to 500 million yuan, and the interest rate is set at 3.6 percent. (3) The loan case for returning farmers in the Yellow River flood area to resume farming was passed. In order to assist the returning farmers in the Yellow River flood area to resume farming, a principle of coordination and promotion was jointly agreed upon with the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Agricultural Bank of China. The UNRRA is responsible for temporary relief, and the Agricultural Bank of China is responsible for loans for more permanent needs. The total loan amount is set at 100 billion yuan and will be handled according to the following methods: (a) The loan will be re-mortgaged by the Central Bank, (b) The Central Bank will first allocate 20 billion yuan to the Agricultural Bank of China for lending, and part of it can be lent by the Central Cooperative Bank.

(4) The detailed loan methods will be formulated by the Agricultural Bank of China for implementation and reported to the Board of Directors for approval at any time.</p>
<h3>The Rice Crisis Affects the Beijing Area; The Social Affairs Bureau Rushes to Transport Flour to Beijing and Ping for Sale</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The rice crisis has spread to the Beijing area. The first rice looting occurred in Pukou Town, a suburb of Beijing, on the 7th. In the afternoon of the 7th, there was another rush to buy flour at the Confucius Temple. On the morning of the 8th, there was another rice looting in Xiaguan, but fortunately, it did not materialize. The Beijing Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau and the Ministry of Food took emergency measures and worked through the night to handle the situation. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has now reported to the Ministry of Food for instructions. However, the rice market in Beijing announced a shutdown on the 8th. Only 120 dan of imported rice entered the market for the entire day, with only one rice boat. According to Social Affairs Bureau Director Xie Zhengfu, Beijing rice merchants do not lack rice in storage, and the negotiated price is 140,000 yuan per dan, with a daily supply of 1,000 dan. However, when rice merchants from Wuhu came to negotiate today, they stated that if the price is still 140,000 yuan, the rice supply will be cut off. Therefore, Xie is requesting instructions from the Ministry of Food. According to general observations, there are three reasons for this rice crisis. First, the negotiated price limit is too low compared to the black market, so merchants are unwilling to sell. At the same time, merchants are hoarding rice and taking a wait-and-see attitude. On the other hand, although the government stipulates that 1,000 dan of negotiated-price rice should be sold, the actual amount sold cannot be counted at any time, so there is inevitably a tendency to underreport. The small amount of negotiated-price rice is not enough to supply the market, leading to a looting spree.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] After the rush to buy flour in Beijing on the 7th, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau quickly worked overnight to transport 6,000 bags of flour from Sanwenhe on the 8th, which is being distributed to city merchants. The flour problem has been resolved.</p>
<p>Wuxi Establishes a Fair Price Sales Office</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Wuxi, 8th] Regarding the rice looting case, Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong replied to the Chamber of Commerce, Qian Sunqing, saying that he had ordered the county to quickly stabilize the market, work with the garrison to maintain public order, and persuade grain merchants to supply grain from storage so that the people would not lack food and their hearts would be at peace. He also sent telegrams to comfort the industrial and commercial sectors. Representatives of the grain, rice milling, and warehouse industries held a meeting at the county chamber of commerce and decided that the chamber of commerce would report the issue of responsibility for the rice looting to the county government and request relief from the authorities for the looted materials. In addition, the authorities have set up 12 fair price sales offices inside and outside the city, which will be implemented from today.</p>
<p>The Suzhou Rice Market Improves</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Suzhou, 8th] The Suzhou County Government convened an emergency meeting on the morning of the 6th with representatives of relevant agencies and the Grain Association to handle the hoarding of grain and provide relief to the people. It was decided to first distribute 700 shi of high-quality white rice stored in the Zhongnan Factory at a fair price of 180,000 yuan in various parts of the city and countryside. The market situation improved today. The price of brown rice was 210,000 yuan, and the price of high-quality white rice was 240,000 yuan, with a total of more than 700 shi traded. Jiangsu Civil Affairs Director Wang Gongyu visited Suzhou on the evening of the 7th and summoned County Magistrate Shen Chenglong on the 8th. He inquired about the food issue and encouraged him not to follow in the footsteps of Hangzhou and Wuxi.</p>
<p>Nanchang Banned Grain Exports</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 8th] Grain prices here have skyrocketed, and the situation is serious. After the ban on rice sales last night, medium-ripe rice reached 123,000, and even brown rice reached 90,000 (per shi), endangering people's livelihoods. The municipal government has decided to take necessary measures to address the grain price issue, stipulating that grain from this city is not allowed to be exported, and rice shops must report their grain reserves within ten days, otherwise they will be sealed. At the same time, group grain purchases will be organized, and funds will be borrowed from banks to make up for any shortfall. In addition, Yixiang Rice Store here was selling brown rice at high prices, and the municipal government has detained its manager for five days as a warning.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanchang, 8th] The situation in Nanchang is still chaotic. Xin Zhou cotton in the cotton market is 890,000, and 20-count battleship yarn is 8,980,000, an increase of one million compared to the previous day. Transactions are scarce, and grain prices are still rising. Indica rice is 120,000, and the price of grain is also rising sharply, at 56,000.</p>
<p>Changchun Opens a Grain Price Meeting</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Changchun, 8th] Prices in Changchun have risen sharply, with rice at 200 yuan per catty and sorghum rising to 100 yuan (Liutong coupons).

Xiong Shihui planned to go to Andong, but this has been terminated. Yesterday, he summoned Jilin Chairman Liang Huasheng, Changchun Mayor Zhao Junmai, and Liaobei Chairman Liu Handong to hold an emergency meeting on grain prices.</p>

<h3>The Death of Lin Keyou, Former Overseas Chinese Representative in Batavia, Is Confirmed</h3>
<p>Indonesian Soldiers Threw the Body into the Sea</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 7th] According to today's Tiansheng Daily: It has now been confirmed that Lin Keyou, the former Overseas Chinese representative in Batavia, was murdered by soldiers of the Indonesian Republic shortly after he returned from Batavia in early 1946. Lin's movements (he met with Consul General Jiang Jiadong at the time) led the Republic soldiers to suspect that he was cooperating with the Dutch, and Lin was later kidnapped and disappeared. After the Dutch occupied Klender in January of this year, the investigation continued and proved that Lin was strangled to death, then put in a sack with stones, and thrown into the sea, making it impossible to rescue him.

<h3>Zhang Fakui Meets with Reporters to Report That the Banditry in Guangdong and Guangxi Is Not a Cause for Concern; The Military Police, Public Security, and Civilian Self-Defense Forces Are Very Strong</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 8th] Director Zhang Fakui recently met with reporters in the Xingyuan Conference Hall to report on the general situation of public security and pacification in Guangdong and Guangxi. According to him: the current number of bandits in the jurisdiction is approximately 14,000, distributed as follows: (1) the Han River area of Fujian and Guangdong, approximately 1,000 people, which have been dispersed through searches and suppressions. (2) the Dongjiang and northern Guangdong area, approximately 3,500 people, due to the remnants of the former Zeng Sheng department of the Dongjiang Column returning. (3) the Six Counties area, approximately 500 people, after searches and suppressions of the original 2,000-plus bandits. (4) the Southern Route area, the most rampant area for bandits, with approximately 3,000 people in Fu Chunmao's so-called People's Liberation Army. (5) approximately 5,000 people in Feng Baiju's department on Hainan Island. (6) Approximately 100 people in the so-called Democratic Allied Army, headed by Huang Weiruo, in Rong County, Guangxi, which have been defeated. Scattered bandits in Guiping, Nanning, and the border areas total approximately 1,300 people. Zhang continued: He never sugarcoats the truth, nor does he exaggerate to create alarm. Before March, the jurisdiction was indeed quite stable. Banditry only became rampant after a part of the National Army was transferred north, especially in the Southern Route area. However, they are definitely not Communist troops or just bandits colluding with Communist troops. They are a disorganized mob and not a cause for concern. Currently, Guangdong Province has more than 40,000 security police officers, plus tens of thousands of civilian guns. The strength of our forces is far greater than that of the bandits. The main reasons for the delay in suppressing them are unclear governance and lax military discipline. Therefore, the only solution at present is to clarify governance and rectify military discipline. Then, suppressing the banditry will not be difficult. However, before that is accomplished, the people will suffer greatly from the bandits. He himself feels very uneasy about the banditry.</p>
<h3>Shang Zhen Will Go to Japan Today to Take Office; Zhu Shiming Publishes a Proclamation in Japan; Reaffirming Our Lenient Policy Toward Japan</h3>

However, when the dismantling and transportation of compensation materials begins, the current number of people will definitely be insufficient. At that time, it will be expanded as needed based on the facts.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Facing the Current Education Crisis</h3>
<p>Today, with the problems of prices and the economic crisis intensifying, we are also facing serious educational problems. Originally, the educational problems at this stage are inseparably linked to China's general socio-economic and political problems after the war. Problems reflected in education are mostly a political and economic issue. The meager salaries of educators and the financial difficulties of schools are not purely educational issues, but are closely related to China's current socio-economic and even political problems. From a broader perspective, these problems are almost impossible to solve without addressing the overarching political and economic situation. But this does not mean that the educational authorities should be able to evade responsibility for these problems. Since the meager salaries of educators and the financial difficulties of schools fall within the scope of education, the authorities in charge of education should quickly devise appropriate countermeasures. However, the core of the current educational problem is not here: the current educational problem is not just an economic or financial problem, but also includes policy issues and discipline issues. As for whether the system of schools at all levels is suitable for the current national conditions, that is another issue regarding the educational system and curriculum. It can be seen that the scope involved in the so-called educational problem is indeed extensive.</p>
<p>In terms of finance or economics, we have seen appeals from the presidents and professors of various national universities. Some university professors have even issued declarations, arguing that the highest salary for civil servants is 800 yuan, while the highest salary for professors is only 600 yuan, which seems unfair. We sympathize with the appeals of university professors, and we understand the difficult lives of university professors, so we hope that the salaries of university professors can be increased, but at the same time, we cannot help but appeal for the salaries of middle school and primary school teachers. The highest salary for university professors is still 600 yuan, and there is also research funding. May we ask how much a middle school or primary school teacher earns? What is the maximum salary they can receive? What is the difference between the living needs of university professors and those of middle school and primary school teachers? Although the government's finances are currently extremely difficult, we hope that the government can adjust the salaries of teachers at all levels of schools so that they can live their difficult lives and devote themselves to their cause of cultivating people.</p>
<p>However, the core of the current educational problem is not a financial problem, but a policy problem. We do not understand what our education policy is. We will not discuss the problem of the educational system now. What we do not understand is the policy. For example, in Zhejiang, there is already National Zhejiang University (as for whether Zhejiang should have a national university, that is another issue that we will not discuss for now), and there is also National Yingshi University. We know that Chen Yingshi was a founding father of the party-state, and he was from Zhejiang. If we want to establish a national university to commemorate him, it is not without reason; but what we do not understand is why Yingshi University should be located in Jinhua, which has nothing to do with Mr. Yingshi's life? Mr. Yingshi was from Huzhou, and he was also the Military Governor of Shanghai, and he died in Shanghai. If we want to establish Yingshi University, it should be located in Huzhou, or it should be located in Shanghai; we do not understand why it is located in Jinhua. This is a policy problem, unrelated to the country's political and economic situation. Now the students of Yingshi University are causing a stir, requesting the relocation of the school. Their behavior may be somewhat excessive, but what we want to point out is that if the education authorities had made a proper decision, this turmoil would not have been caused. The education authorities cannot shirk this responsibility.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also the problem of the middle school graduation examination in various places. The education authorities have decided to restore the middle school graduation examination this year, giving the reason that it will improve the level of middle schools. Once this news was announced, students in various places expressed unease and requested exemption. When this news was published in the newspapers, it was reported that the Director of Secondary Education of the Ministry of Education stated: "Students in Nanjing and Shanghai no longer oppose the examination," seemingly indicating that the middle school graduation examination will still be held. There may be various reasons for the opposition of middle school students in various places, which we need not elaborate on. What we want to ask is: On what policy is the decision to have a middle school graduation examination based? Theoretically speaking, the adoption of the current middle school graduation examination system is untenable. Whether the level of middle school education meets the prescribed standards can be noted by the educational authorities through the inspectors at any time. If the implementation of the examination system is hoped to improve the level of middle school education, this seems to conflict with the purpose of setting up inspectors and other personnel. If, after the examination, students can voluntarily enter university, then the so-called examination is tantamount to a kind of university entrance examination; however, the nature of the middle school graduation examination under the current system is different from this. After the examination, there will inevitably be a university entrance examination. Then there is a problem with the adoption of this examination system in principle. This system should not have been adopted in the first place, and now it is to be restored. What policy is this? This is tantamount to the education authorities denying themselves. Whether the students oppose it or not is another matter, which we will not discuss.</p>
<p>Because the measures of the education authorities themselves lack consideration, they have aroused turmoil in various places. The overstepping of student behavior is not right; for example, the current turmoil of Yingshi University students petitioning in Nanjing, according to reports, has also affected the railway traffic between Shanghai and Hangzhou. If the rumors are true, we regret this lawless behavior for the reputation of Chinese university students. However, the improper handling by the education authorities is also difficult to blame. In addition, regarding the issue of overseas students and the issue of co-education, what exactly is the policy adopted by the education authorities, and it is also not without doubt that education is for the future life of the nation, and we cannot let it be eroded, and we cannot let bureaucracy run rampant in the sacred cause of education. We hope that the education authorities can make wise decisions on educational decisions.</p>

<h3>U.S. Government to Submit to Congress Soon: Plan to Revive the South Korean Economy; Marshall Officially Announces to the Press; State Department Plans to Take Over All Occupied Territories from the War Department</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Secretary of State Marshall announced to the press today that the U.S. government would soon submit a plan to Congress to revive Korea. Other sources say that this move may specify an initial budget of $75 million. Marshall added that details of the plan are not yet fully finalized. Once Congress has made a final vote on the aid bill for Greece and Turkey, this case can be submitted for discussion. According to current plans, $75 million must be spent in the U.S.-occupied zone of Korea within one year, starting on June 30th of this year, to supplement the more than $135 million in regular occupation costs. This funding will be mainly used to restore industries lost during the war. Korea's industrial production capacity is currently only 20%. The US-Soviet Joint Commission is scheduled to resume negotiations on the unification of Korea on the 20th of this month. If an agreement can be reached at that time, the funding for rebuilding power plants and railways may be revised. Whether this aid plan will extend beyond one year depends on the economic self-reliance of the 10 million residents of southern Korea. In addition, a three-year plan to revive Korea, costing $500 million to $600 million, is being drafted.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] Secretary of State Marshall also made the following statement at a press conference today: (1) When and how to proceed with preparations for the peace conference with Japan are now under careful consideration. I believe that the State Department should take over the administrative affairs of Japan, Korea, and the German occupied territories from the War Department. Whether the transfer will be handled immediately is not to be stated at present. Former Secretary of State Byrnes opposed this proposal. (2) The House Appropriations Committee's recommendation to reduce funding by 22% is a current problem for the State Department. The committee's recommendation to cancel funding for overseas broadcasting is extremely important. (3) The United States is not currently considering providing special assistance to France after the Ramadier cabinet expelled the communist cabinet members. Marshall met with the French ambassador to the United States today to discuss coal, wheat, international bank loans, and labor exchange issues between the French army in Germany and the US and British military occupation zones.</p>
<h3>Treaty to Defend the Western Hemisphere</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] A certain U.S. official told an Agence France-Presse reporter today that Secretary of State Marshall is eager for the Pan-American Conference to be held as soon as possible in the Brazilian capital so that the 21 republics of the Americas can sign a treaty to defend the Western Hemisphere. The State Department has recently received concrete evidence that the Argentine government is complying with various democratic principles, making Argentina qualified to participate in this conference.</p>
<h3>U.S. State Department Decides to Establish: A Bureau of Diplomatic Policy Planning; to Be Headed by Soviet Expert Kennan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The State Department announced today the establishment of a special planning bureau responsible for formulating and implementing long-term U.S. foreign policy matters. Marshall decided to establish this bureau after succeeding Byrnes as Secretary of State. The bureau will work under the guidance of the Undersecretary of State and will be headed by Kennan, an official with a long history of service in the diplomatic community, who is a specialist on Soviet problems. Another State Department diplomat, Savage, will serve as secretary. The main tasks are: (1) to formulate and implement long-term foreign policies in order to achieve various objectives of U.S. diplomacy; (2) to foresee and deal with certain problems that the State Department may encounter in the implementation of foreign policy; (3) to prepare and draft reports on broad political and military issues that the State Department may assign; (4) to make recommendations, either on its own initiative or at the request of the Secretary or Undersecretary of State, regarding the appropriateness of current foreign policy; (5) to coordinate planned activities within the State Department.</p>
<h3>Soviets Make Additional Demands on Hungary</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 7th] Reliable sources here say that the Soviet Union and Hungary are currently conducting compensation negotiations. The Soviets have made additional demands on Hungary totaling $200 million. According to the armistice agreement and the peace treaty, Hungary should pay the Soviet Union $200 million in reparations. The armistice agreement stipulates that Hungary should pay it off within six years, while the peace treaty extends the period to eight years. Therefore, the Soviet Union's new demands are equal to the amount of compensation that Hungary should pay to the Soviet Union. The content of these new demands can be divided into three categories: (1) The Soviet Union demands that Hungary cede all German assets within Hungary. According to Article 28 of the peace treaty with Hungary and the Potsdam Agreement, the Soviet Union has the right to obtain this property, the value of which is about half of the total demand; (2) The Soviet Union demands that Hungary pay the Soviet Union all the debts that Hungary owed to Germany at the end of the war; (3) The Soviet Union demands that Hungary fulfill the debts owed to the Soviet Union for the following reasons: (A) the Hungarian currency advanced by the Soviet Union to the Hungarian provisional government at the end of the war; (B) the expenses of equipping the Hungarian army by the Soviet Union. It is reported that the main point of contention in the current Soviet-Hungarian negotiations is the aforementioned second item. Hungary believes that although Hungary owed debts to Germany at the end of the war, Germany also owed debts to Hungary, so they should be offset first. Although the British government does not intend to intervene at this stage, it is known that the British government's position is that the debts owed by Germany to that country should be taken into account when calculating the debts owed to Germany.</p>
<h3>Brazil Outlaws Communist Party; Court Declares Communist Party an Illegal Organization</h3>

<h3>U.S. Senate Approves Funding for: Building Experimental Submarine; Navy to Establish Group to Handle Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th Dispatch] The bill to allocate $30 million to authorize the Navy Department to build experimental submarines has been passed by the U.S. Senate and sent to the White House. At the same time, in order to enhance air defense, the Navy Department has ordered the construction of ten 45-foot-long rockets, which can fly twice as high as the German "V-2" missile and can be launched from ships.

The Navy Department stated that the rocket, mainly designed to fly in the stratosphere, can carry 100 pounds of explosives and fly to a height of 235 miles.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 7th] The Navy Department announced today that it will set up a special group to handle the construction of warships propelled by atomic energy. This is part of the entire naval development plan, and the Navy's tactical concepts are expected to be completely changed as a result.</p>

<h3>U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill: House of Representatives Engaged in Heated Debate; Final Vote Expected Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] Today is the day for the House of Representatives to make a final decision on the $400 million aid bill to Greece and Turkey. After debating this anti-communist measure for nine days, the House of Representatives began today to engage in fierce debate on amendments to restrict the bill or amendments to cancel the bill. Most of the members who are strongly opposed to the bill are pinning their hopes on an amendment to entrust the Greek and Turkish problem to the United Nations for handling. This amendment would stipulate that if the United Nations fails to take action within 60 days, the aid plan will be transferred to the House Armed Services Committee for handling. Democratic and Republican members who support the bill admit that they are most concerned about this amendment. They say that its impact will doom the measures that Marshall considers urgent. Representative Bender, a strong opponent of the bill, is prepared to propose six amendments, one of which is to remove Turkey from the aid plan, and another is that Greece must abolish the monarchy and hold general elections to elect a new ruling body. A total of more than ten amendments are aimed at the bill. Although the leaders of the House of Representatives are eager to have the bill put to a final vote tonight, there is little hope of reaching this stage, and it will have to wait until tomorrow to be decided. The supporters say that this bill will eliminate another war, while the opponents say that this bill will be the beginning of another war.</p>

<h3>MacArthur Denies Rumor; Denies U.S. Will Assume Japan's Defense</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] MacArthur today denied the rumor in the press that the United States will assume Japan's future defense, saying that this statement is clearly absurd and not worth paying attention to. MacArthur continued: "Before the peace treaty with Japan is signed, Japan's security is the responsibility of the United Nations and is entrusted to the occupying forces for implementation. After the peace treaty is signed, Japan's security depends on the terms of the peace treaty. Due to Japan's strategic position in terms of agency and its relationship with Pacific defense, the United States may pay special attention to this issue."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 8th] Although MacArthur denied guaranteeing the Emperor of Japan that he would defend Japan, the rumors are not without foundation, which was inadvertently revealed by Okamura, the director of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's Information Bureau. Okamura served as the Emperor's interpreter during the meeting between MacArthur and the Emperor, and later revealed details to Japanese reporters, who in turn revealed them to a foreign news agency. It is heard that Okamura has resigned yesterday to take responsibility, but it has not been accepted, but may be accepted later.</p>

<h3>Italian Cabinet Crisis</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 7th] The Italian cabinet held an urgent meeting today, and a decision may be made on whether the coalition government will resign or not.

<h3>Reorganization of the Lamadier Cabinet: New Cabinet Members to be Announced Today or Tomorrow; Defusing Labor Unrest Seen as Urgent Priority</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] Well-informed sources here have confirmed that the vacancies resulting from the Communist Party's withdrawal from the government, including the key positions of Vice-Premier, formerly held by Thorez, and Minister of Defense, formerly held by Billoux, may now be filled by the Socialist Party. It is reported that the position of Minister of Labor, formerly held by Croizat, will be taken by a member of the Popular Republican Movement, while the position of Minister of Reconstruction, formerly held by Dilon, will be filled by a member of the Radical Party. However, President Auriol will travel to Orléans tomorrow to attend the celebrations of the second anniversary of the victory in Europe and the commemoration of Joan of Arc, so the list of new cabinet members will not be officially released until tomorrow evening or the morning after. According to qualified observers, the most pressing issue for the French government will be reaching an agreement with the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) on wage issues. It is anticipated that the CGT will propose increasing production bonuses and family allowances, and setting a minimum monthly wage of 7,000 francs. It is reported that Prime Minister Ramadier has expressed willingness to consider these demands.</p>
<h3>Socialist Party Declaration: Expresses Regret Over the Communist Party</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] Following the National Committee of the Socialist Party's resolution to support the continued leadership of the Ramadier Cabinet, a communiqué was issued stating that the Party deeply regrets the Communist Party's refusal to support the government's policy of curbing inflation. However, the Socialist Party believes that some people want to use anti-communism as a smokescreen in an attempt to organize a united cabinet, which would incite hostility between these two left-wing parties and split the national workforce into two factions, so it cannot approve of this. We also wish to solemnly declare that if the government is based on a reactionary majority, the Socialist Party will not be able to continue to participate in the government for long. In the future, the Ramadier Cabinet should maintain close contact with trade unions. Therefore, the Communist Party's withdrawal from the cabinet does not mean that the Communist Party and the Socialist Party are parting ways.</p>

<h3>Rice Merchants Throughout the City Suspend Business to Petition: Gather a Crowd to Make Trouble and Destroy Radio Station; Paint Shops, Theaters, Tobacco Shops, and Many Other Places Also Affected</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] Rice prices in the city have been rising for days, causing public anxiety.

Therefore, they announced yesterday that they would voluntarily suspend business. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, more than 300 retail rice merchants went to the city government to petition. They elected seven representatives, including Zhang Yimao, Gu Yarong, and Shen Zai, to meet with Mayor Wu and present two points: (1) Please earnestly dispatch police to protect against recent incidents of robbing rice and attacking shops. (2) Please find a way to stop the insults in the broadcasts of various radio stations. Mayor Wu replied, stating in brief: Regarding the first point, if any lawless citizens take the opportunity to disrupt rice shops, they will be arrested and sent to court for strict punishment, and the police bureau has been ordered to comply and the garrison commander has been asked to send personnel to assist in maintaining order. As for radio stations that deliberately spread rumors and slander, they can be sued in court. Wu continued, hoping that the rice merchants would sell their stored rice at a legitimate profit. He also said that the government's improved plan for allocating and selling rice has been submitted to the central government for approval.</p>
<p>Making Trouble En Route, Two Shops Suffer</p>
<p>After the petitioning rice merchants left the city government at about 12:00 noon, they then went to the Huaxing Radio Station at 19 Qingdao Road to make trouble. The reason was that a comedian named Zhu Liang, known professionally as Xiao Kuaile, who performs on the radio station, has been scolding unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate on rice prices as "rice weevils" due to the soaring rice prices and the difficulty in purchasing rice. This angered some rice merchants, who had previously warned him by telephone that if he did not change his attitude, there would be unfavorable consequences. Xiao did not pay attention to it. After the petitioning rice merchants left the city government and went to the Huaxing Radio Station, they intended to find Xiao to question him. On the way, when they passed the Fuxing Chang Paint Shop at 458 Jiujiang Road, they suddenly heard someone shout, "The rice weevils are coming!" They were furious and immediately started a fight, destroying nine-tenths of the Fuxing Chang Paint Shop. Various colors of paint were scattered all over the ground, and the thugs left satisfied. Then, upon hearing the sound of "rice weevils" on Guling Road, they smashed a large piece of glass in the Dazhongyuan Tobacco Shop at 124 Guling Road, and also destroyed a door of the clinic of Dr. Shi Zhifen at 6 Lane 51.</p>

<p>Huaxing Radio Station Suddenly Destroyed</p>
<p>At 1:20 p.m., the rice merchants and others arrived at Qingdao Road and broke into the "Huaxing" Radio Station. Xiao Kuaile's broadcast time on the radio station was from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. every day, so he had not arrived at that time. The rice merchants started smashing from the repair department downstairs of the radio station, and smashed up to the broadcasting room on the third floor. All the machines were destroyed. The rice merchants could not find Xiao Kuaile and thought he had escaped to the Mingxing Theater across from "Huaxing," so they went to the theater to cause trouble and destroyed the iron gate. At this point, the Xincheng Police Sub-Bureau and the Fengyang Road Military Police Team had already received the news and dispatched police and military police to suppress the situation. The disturbance subsided at about 3:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Six Thugs Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>Six rice merchant thugs were arrested on the spot and taken to the Xincheng Sub-Bureau for interrogation. It is reported that the entire case will be submitted to the General Bureau and then transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The Fuxing Chang Paint Shop and Huaxing Radio Station, which were destroyed, have reported the damage to the police bureau and are said to be suing the court for compensation. The names of the six rice merchant thugs arrested at the time are listed below: (1) He Youxing, 42 years old, from Shaoxing, resident of 77 Shanyin Road, owner of Fuhe Rice Shop. (2) Lu Ji, 35 years old, from Pudong, employee of Wanshengxing Rice Shop, resident of 5 Lane 145, Guling Road. (3) Xu Xichen, 35 years old, from Zhenjiang, employee of Zhenglong Rice Shop, resident of 435 West Beijing Road. (4) Che Baoxing, 20 years old, from Baoshan, apprentice at Heshengxie Rice Shop, resident of 50 Fuyou Lane, Nanshi. (5) Ma Haiping, 32 years old, from Pudong, owner of Futaifeng Rice Shop, resident of 180 Yanhai Road, Nanshi. (6) Lu Caigen, 18 years old, from Pudong, apprentice at Yucheng Rice Shop, resident of 99 Guangxi Road.</p>
<p>Xiao Kuaile's Family: Wife and Daughter Beaten</p>
<p>At about 5:30 p.m., the rice merchants were still not satisfied because they had not caught Xiao Kuaile. Later, they learned that his residence was on the upper floor of the Guanghua Laundry Shop at 239 Yunnan Road, so they hired two trucks with about 50 or 60 people and drove to the vicinity of the above location. After stopping the car, seven or eight people jumped down first and went to the third floor. They searched for Xiao Kuaile but he was not there, so they slapped his wife, Zhu Chuanmeiyun (28 years old, from Nanjing), and then slapped Xiao's young daughter, Xia Yun (7 years old), in the face. Then they used wooden sticks to destroy dressing tables, mirror frames, hot water bottles, glass clothes trees, air pumps, bowls, and other items, and scattered in a commotion. Later, the Lao Zha Police Bureau received a report and Director Jiang immediately led a large number of police officers to rush to the scene, but the rice merchants had already left. They summoned Chuanmeiyun to the bureau to inquire about the damage and District Chief Shi ordered two police officers to escort her back to her residence.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Delayed</h3>
<p>The Reason is that Yingshi University Students are Petitioning</p>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] More than 500 students from National Yingshi University, in order to demand the relocation of the school, departed from Jinhua on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway train the night before, intending to transfer to the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to go to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Education. After arriving in Hangzhou yesterday morning, they gathered at the Hangzhou Railway Station and demanded that the stationmaster immediately allocate a train to depart. The Hangzhou stationmaster refused their request because they had not purchased tickets or completed transfer procedures, which almost led to a conflict. The trains to Shanghai were thus blocked and delayed. The Shanghai Railway Bureau received the news and, in order to maintain Shanghai-Hangzhou traffic, immediately reported to Beijing and ordered the trains departing from Shanghai to Hangzhou to continue to operate with the Gengshanmen Station as the terminal. The West Lake train from Hangzhou to Shanghai departed from Gengshanmen at 8:30 a.m.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Tragically Dies Under Her Nephew's Knife; The Killer is the Owner of a Western Clothing Store Who Has a History of Mental Illness; Cai Gongda Confesses the Reason at the Police Station: Attempted Indecency Was Rejected, Resulting in Murder Out of Revenge</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] Cai Gongda, 34 years old, from Ningbo, the owner of the Xiexing Western Clothing Store at 1181 West Beijing Road, suddenly attacked the tenant, a young woman named Wang Cai Genyu (28 years old, from Ningbo), with a knife at the back door of the stairs at about 11:50 a.m. yesterday. She was slashed nine times, including five times on her left foot, once on her forehead, once on her skull, and once each on her chest and face, and immediately fell to the ground and died. After committing the crime, Cai fled through the back door, intending to hire a streetcar to escape. He was spotted by Wu Wenbing, a tailor at the clothing store, who blew the police whistle and summoned two police officers, numbers 772 and 234, who intercepted the murderer and took him to the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-Bureau. It is understood that the deceased was the paternal aunt of the murderer, Cai Gongda. Her husband, Wang Guifang, 32 years old, is a western-style tailor and has been working at the clothing store. He is currently ill with lung disease and lying on the third floor. Cai suffers from mental illness, which comes and goes. In November of the year before last, his sister and his wife, Cai Gu, were buying Mabao to treat a chronic illness. Cai falsely accused them of murder at the Songshan Police Sub-Bureau. After investigation, the truth was revealed. Later, although his family sent him to a mental hospital for treatment, he has not yet recovered. According to Cai's confession, his paternal aunt, Wang Cai Genyu, was beautiful, and because her husband, Wang Guifang, was seriously ill, he had the idea of ​​coveting her. Because his repeated requests for indecency were rejected, he became angry and killed her. This case will be transferred to the judicial authorities for trial after the investigation is completed.</p>

<h3>Mayor Heard the News and Sent an Angry Telegram; Strictly Ordered Military and Police to Take Precautions; Summoned Representatives of the Rice Industry Association; Urged to Resume Door-to-Door Sales Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] After Mayor Wu learned of the news of the rice merchants destroying the radio station, he believed that the citizens robbing rice shops and the rice merchants attacking the radio station were both illegal acts. Therefore, he strictly ordered the military and police to take precautions and summoned representatives of the Rice Industry Association, Qu Zhenhua, at the city government at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to urge them to resume door-to-door sales starting today, and expressed that they could guarantee the safety of the rice shops that handled the government's allocated rice.</p>
<p>Qu Zhenhua immediately made three requests to Mayor Wu: (1) Request the bail of Xi Wenqi, the manager of Quansheng Rice Shop. (2) The six rice merchants who were arrested for destroying the Huaxing Radio Station should also be released on bail first. (3) The rice shops that were destroyed should be compensated for all losses by the authorities. Mayor Wu replied as follows: (1) The arrest of Gong Wenqi is a legal issue and does not fall within the scope of the city government. It should be resolved through legal channels. (2) The destruction of the Huaxing Radio Station is a judicial issue. Those who violate the criminal law will be strictly punished according to the law, and the city government cannot help. (3) It is impossible to ask the city government to compensate for the losses, but the government will definitely severely punish the perpetrators. Qu Zhenhua said that he was willing to be responsible for conveying the mayor's opinion to his colleagues, but he could not guarantee that the rice shops could all resume business today.</p>
<p>Briefed Reporters on Three Points</p>
<p>Mayor Wu also hosted reporters in the city government conference room at 5:00 p.m. yesterday, reporting the following measures for handling the food problem and preventing accidents: (1) Mayor Wu was very angry about the prevalence of disturbances. He said: The common people certainly feel that their food supply is insufficient, but since the rationing system has been implemented, there should be no more acts of disturbance. Moreover, attacking rice shops will not make rice prices fall. On the contrary, if rice merchants close their doors and stop selling as a result, the majority of citizens will be affected. In order to prevent such illegal actions, the mayor has telegraphed the garrison commander and ordered the police bureau to protect the rice shops. Those citizens who overstep the line will be severely punished. (2) The method of allocating rice has been improved. In addition to civil servants and teachers who have allocated rice, students and workers will also implement direct allocation of rice. In addition, for the problem of civilian rice, some rice shops will be designated as public rice shops for civilians. (3) Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian went to Beijing last night to discuss with the Ministry of Food to improve the method of allocating and selling food rice. In principle, it was decided to completely directly allocate to various agencies, without going through the hands of rice merchants.</p>
<h3>More Than 10,000 Silk Weaving Workers Stop Work to Petition and Parade; Demand Unconditional Unfreezing of the Cost of Living Index; Mayor Wu Persuades to Wait for a Reasonable Solution</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] More than 10,000 silk weaving workers throughout the city, in order to demand the immediate and unconditional unfreezing of the cost of living index, specially stopped work for half a day yesterday afternoon and marched in a team to the city government and the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Along the way, they shouted slogans, distributed declarations, and posted slogans. These more than 10,000 people belonged to more than 400 units affiliated with the First, Second, Third, and Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Unions, including workers from state-owned Zhongcan, privately-owned Meiya, and Dacheng factories. After gathering at the Bund at 2:30 p.m., they went to the city government. Four representatives were sent to meet with Mayor Wu, demanding the immediate and unconditional unfreezing of the cost of living index and curbing prices. Mayor Wu agreed to forward it to the central government, but said: The central government has agreed in principle to unfreeze the index, and is currently studying the details. There is no need to petition again. He hoped that there would be no more large-scale parades in the future. If there are any problems, representatives can be sent to discuss them. He also said that the current industrial and commercial sectors are in an unstable and depressed state, and everyone should think about the overall situation and not make their own plans. Moreover, this unfreezing is planned by the central government, and I hope you will wait for a reasonable solution. The petitioning crowd then turned to the Social Affairs Bureau. Director Wu happened to be away on official business, and the representatives left a petition and then left. The workers from each district then returned to their respective factories.</p>

<h3>Exploring the Reasons for the Rise in Kerosene Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] The Fuel Group of the Price Review Council held a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon and decided that manufacturers should first calculate the cost of coal, coal balls, firewood, and kerosene and submit tables for verification. During the meeting, opinions were exchanged on the reasons for the recent soaring kerosene prices. It was believed that it was due to the expiration of the Import Management Committee and the failure to open foreign exchange. Due to the failure to settle foreign exchange, the incoming goods were sealed by the customs, and the company had not allocated them for two months, resulting in soaring market prices. It was decided that the Social Affairs Bureau would send a letter to the Import Management Committee requesting the release of foreign exchange on schedule.</p>
<h3>Female Spy Brings Child to Court; Confession is Very Absurd; Han Youjie's Trial Concluded Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] Han Youjie, female, was originally Japanese, but later obtained Chinese nationality after marrying Han Jingtang. She was accused of serving as an enemy spy. The trial was held in the High Court yesterday. The defendant was short and fat, wearing a blue silk cheongsam, a yellow velvet jacket, glasses, and a bun. Her face was slightly swollen, and she wore light makeup, holding a one or two-year-old baby in her arms, who was babbling. Han was accused of serving as a "trustee" in the staff headquarters of Chief Benjo Shigeru after the "September 18th" Incident, and as the dean of the Fengtian Shanlin Women's Middle School, etc.</p>
<p>Enslaving Our Soldiers and Civilians</p>
<p>After the "July 7th" Incident, she served as a "trustee" in the Pingdi Gendarmerie and the Army Special Service Agency, responsible for contacting the puppet local maintenance committees, and also served as the head of the women's comfort team under the Beizhina Area Army Temple, using the name of comforting refugees and prisoners to secretly carry out the enslavement of our soldiers and civilians. Later, she served in the "comfort" work of Yamashita Tomoyuki's department, was promoted to major general and served as a military advisor, and "recruited" many bandits and guerrillas for the enemy. Then, she was dispatched to "North Manchuria" to investigate the Soviet army. Later, at the invitation of Ono, the commander of the Nanjing Enemy Gendarmerie, and Shao Wen'kai, the governor of the puppet Henan Province, she went to Henan and Shandong provinces to lure our guerrillas, and more than 70,000 of them were incorporated by her. In addition, the defendant went to "Manchukuo" in "Showa 15" to visit the puppet emperor "Puyi" and had dealings with Matsuoka Yosuke and Zhang Jinghui. She was captured by the relevant authorities after the victory.</p>
<p>Arguing Endlessly</p>
<p>After repeated questioning by Judge Xiao yesterday, the defendant still argued endlessly. Her confession was extremely absurd. She even said that she was "the nanny of the Chinese people." During the war, she repeatedly provided relief to Chinese troops and refugees, and said: "Now that my father is back, is the nanny no longer needed?" The defendant's Mandarin was quite fluent, and she pleaded tearfully, but her nerves seemed to be stimulated, so her words were incoherent. The court did not pay attention because the defendant had written a book called "A 20-Year Active Career in China" as evidence. The court announced that the trial of the case was concluded and the verdict would be pronounced on the morning of the 15th. The defendant held the baby in her arms with tears in her eyes and was returned to the women's prison.</p>

When reporters approached to inquire about Mr. Liu's medical treatment in the United States, Madam Liu was unable to answer due to her sobbing. At 11:00, the coffin was unloaded from the ship by crane, amidst the sound of firecrackers and mournful music. The coffin was made of yellow teak and was covered with the national flag upon landing. Mr. Yu Youren then led the greeters in a simple memorial ceremony, with Madam Liu, her son Zhiyuan, and grandson Huacheng kneeling to express their gratitude.

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 8th] Regarding publicly and privately funded students studying abroad, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs once suspended the issuance of passports after the announcement of the emergency economic measures plan, and the Ministry of Education immediately suspended review.

<h3>New British Professor Hired by Peking University Passes Through Shanghai Today Heading North</h3>
<p>William Empson, who was hired by Dr. Hu Shih, President of Peking University, as a professor of English literature at the university, arrived here yesterday with his wife and two children and will head north today. Mr. Empson is a famous literary critic and one of the leaders of the modern British poetry scene. He taught English literature at Tokyo Imperial University and came to China in 1937. During the war, he taught at the Southwest Associated University in Changsha and Kunming. He later returned to his home country and served as the director of the Chinese section of the BBC.</p>
<h3>The Restoration and Improvement of the Joint Exam</h3>
<p>— Chen Dongyuan</p>
<p>The high school graduation joint exam has been implemented in China for over a decade. Even during the War of Resistance, we held it as usual except in the real war zones. In the summer of 1945, due to repatriation, the Ministry of Education ordered all schools in the rear to close early at the end of May to prepare for repatriation, and the graduation joint exam was also temporarily suspended. This year, the Ministry of Education issued a notice to restore the joint exam, which is a natural thing. However, students always feel that one less thing is better than one more thing, so there are expressions of requesting a temporary postponement of the restoration, and the public opinion circles have also responded to it. There are even those who say that "since the students are calling for the cessation of the exam, the education authorities should adopt public opinion and change the method." Whether the joint exam should be restored can be studied. If there is a reason to restore the joint exam, it should be restored. If it is to be answered simply because the students have a request, this is not in line with the principles of education.</p>
<p>The high school graduation joint exam is a kind of system in education. In developed countries in education, such as England, France, and Germany, high school graduates must go through a joint exam presided over by people outside the school, and they must go through two joint exams. The first exam is one or two years before high school graduation, and the second exam is at the time of high school graduation. Those who pass the exam can also freely continue their studies, becoming a kind of system. China has held graduation joint exams for more than ten years and has also formed a kind of system. Although the current situation is not good and various aspects of society are not stable, we always hope that various aspects can return to normal as soon as possible. The restoration of the system is a kind of force to help restore the normal state, which is not allowed to be opposed, and it does not seem that it should be opposed.</p>
<p>Some people think that the purpose of the joint exam is to improve the level of students, and they feel that the level of middle school students cultivated during the war is undeniably low. Why use the joint exam to improve it in a short period of time? Most people who oppose the joint exam use this as a strong reason, saying that this is "forcing growth." This kind of argument misreads the premise. The purpose of the joint exam is not to improve the level, but to regulate the level. The current problem of middle schools is not that the level needs to be improved, but that the level is not uniform enough. If it is necessary to improve the level, attention should be paid when revising the curriculum standards. However, the current problem of middle schools is definitely not here. On the contrary, when revising the curriculum standards, everyone agreed to simplify it and not to increase the burden on students. This shows that we do not hope to improve the level of middle schools. However, we always hope that the already stipulated curriculum standards can be achieved. And, to determine whether the school's teaching is conscientious and whether the students' level can meet the established standards, there must be a system to check and supervise. With this system, the school cannot help but be conscientious about teaching, and lazy students cannot help but work hard, and the entire middle school education can reach a minimum level. This is the purpose of the joint exam. Although the level of students during the war was low, it is still necessary to investigate what it was low to. Because it is low, there is no need for a joint exam. Isn't it like opposing a physical examination because the body is not good?</p>
<p>Fearing difficulty and seeking temporary ease is human nature, and selfishness is also a common problem of human beings. After the joint exam has been suspended for two years, the students graduating this year will inevitably have the hope of another year of suspension. However, this is precisely the cowardly and selfish psychology, which is not allowed in education. If the school authorities are afraid that the joint exam results of their own school's graduates will not be good, which will affect the school's status, thereby encouraging students to oppose the joint exam, or using the joint exam opportunity to eliminate students in advance to show off, this all loses the attitude that educators should have. It must be known that students have the opportunity to participate in exams at any time after leaving school, and they must be prepared to be tested by others at any time. Educators should urge students to review their lessons before graduating. Excellent teachers should guide students to make a systematic overview of the review of their lessons, learn a kind of order, understand the essence of the subject, and avoid mechanical memorization. Such review is very beneficial to young people. So we should make good use of the joint exam and not reject it.</p>
<p>We also don't need to think of the joint exam as too difficult. According to the experience of the past ten years, although it cannot be said that 100% can pass the joint exam held in various provinces and cities, in fact, the students who pass are always above 90%. At the time of the initial restoration of the joint exam, the intention of the education authorities was nothing more than to maintain this system and not to embarrass students. It will definitely not be more difficult than the joint exam before the war. Furthermore, for the students, if they finally fall into the minority of those who fail to pass after exerting their own strength, then it must be that their own grades do have problems. Rather than graduating reluctantly and deceiving others and deceiving oneself, it is better to settle down and study in high school for another year and lay a solid foundation, which is only beneficial and not harmful to the individual's future.</p>
<p>There is only one problem that everyone is dissatisfied with the Chinese joint exam system. That is, the joint exam can only obtain graduation qualifications and cannot replace the entrance exam for universities. As a result, students have to participate in several exams in the summer of graduation, which is not only too hard for the students, but also not very consistent with reason. Therefore, some people advocate that the joint exam should be held jointly with the university entrance exam. This makes a lot of sense. Unfortunately, there are still many obstacles in fact that cannot be done immediately. Fortunately, this year's joint exam has paid attention to this issue. The notice of the Ministry of Education has stipulated that the students with the best results in the joint exam can be recommended to study at the universities they want to. This is already a step forward. And the universities in Shanghai have recently planned to admit a part of the students directly based on the joint exam results in addition to the recommended places stipulated by the Ministry of Education. This is the best thing to do. It is hoped that universities in other places can have this kind of practice, so that they can gradually achieve the goal of being able to continue their studies with the pass of the joint exam in the future, so as to complete a perfect system.</p>

<h3>Items for Participation in Next Year's World Games to be Determined Based on This Year's National Games Results</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Eighth Dispatch] The 14th World Games will be held in England next year. The selection committee for the Chinese delegation has decided to select four items: "Football," "Basketball," "Track and Field," and "Swimming." A decision on participation in "Race Walking," "Cycling," and "Baseball" has not yet been made. According to the Secretary-General of the Sports Association, Dong Shouyi: The number of representatives and competitive performance items at the last World Games was larger. For example, the participation of martial arts personnel was specially funded by Mr. Shang Jing Shang Zhen to go abroad. The remaining expenses were all raised by the association. Currently, due to the initial post-war recovery, association funds are difficult and still being raised. In addition, due to foreign exchange relations and factual issues, the number of items to be participated in this time must be smaller. It depends on the results of this year's National Games. If there are any special discoveries and they are recognized by the selection committee, other items besides the four decided items can also be added depending on the availability of funds.</p>

<h3>The Decline of Chinese Stocks Continues: Although There Was a Rebound in the Morning, It Was Ultimately Suppressed; Panic Spread, and Rui Di, Yong Sha Both Reached Limit Down</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks experienced another disastrous sell-off yesterday before the close. There was a brief glimmer of hope in the morning. Yong Sha, with a substantial interest rate of around four corners, eventually proved unsustainable after reaching a high point. Hong Kong-Shanghai Telephone and Telegraph rose, and news of loans spread, leading to a collapse in the afternoon. Yong Sha fell more than one hundred yuan below the limit. With the exception of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, which reached limit up, eight or nine out of ten stocks hit limit down.</p>
<p>In arbitrage trading, Yong Sha swap rates started at 330 yuan, with the buy-side eagerly posting offers. The banks' supply of chips was limited, and prices were driven up all the way, reaching high prices of 550 yuan and 580 yuan near noon. Xin He ranged between 200 yuan and 250 yuan. Small stocks ranged from 8 yuan to 15 yuan. The combined daily interest rate ranged from about 2 corners to 3 corners and 5 points. With a little calculation, one could earn about 4 corners. In the afternoon, Yong Sha's price dropped from the 180s to the 152s, then to 370 yuan, with a combined interest rate of just over 2 and a half corners.</p>
<p>At the morning opening, Mei Ya was still at limit down, while other stocks appeared relatively stable. Rui Di and Yong Sha entered the market, with both buy and sell sides engaging in swap transactions, forming a consolidation. Prices hovered between 6520 yuan and 6650 yuan, then declined slightly due to supply from numbers 35, 218, and 152. Numbers 75, 237, 76, 102, 223, 97, 232, and 129 all entered the market, and Rui Di and Yong Sha rose again to 6780 yuan. Numbers 152, 153, and 155 took profits at the high, and prices retreated to 6640 yuan. Numbers 145, 207, 142, 35, 16, 224, 154, 22, and 82 entered the market, and buying momentum became intense. Mei Ya rebounded from limit down, and Wu He and Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank reached limit up. Rumors spread that the exchange rate would be changed to 40,000 yuan, and Rui Di and Yong Sha reached a high price of 6900 yuan. Numbers 94, 83, 8, 4, 65, 102, 112, and 97 sold off, and floor traders and young speculators suppressed the price. Near noon, China Silk and Cement fell to the limit, and Rui Di and Yong Sha retreated to the morning's initial low price. However, outside investors and banks absorbed the supply, and numbers 70, 142, 231, and 65 took advantage of the low price to absorb the supply. The noon close was still stable. After the close, spot Yong Sha was bid up to 6100 yuan, and Rui Di and Yong Sha reached 6680 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Sha, Xin He, Qin Xing, Jing Fu, and Xin Hua each fell by slightly more than 5%, Xin Guang rose slightly, Mei Ya hit limit down, and Yong Gong fell by slightly less than 10%. In deferred delivery trading, there was only half a day of trading the previous day, with Mei Ya at limit down, and Yong Sha, Xin He, Xin Guang, Shui Gong, Jing Fu, and Qin Xing each up by about 10%. Cold stocks Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank and Wu He reached limit up. Cement briefly rebounded after hitting limit down, and the decline was reduced to slightly less than 5%. China Textile, Tong Yi, and Jing Lun each fell by between 10% and slightly less than 15%, China Silk hit limit down, Matches was flat, and the rest declined slightly to varying degrees of up to 5%.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Hong Kong-Shanghai Telephone and Telegraph was seen to rise, and sentiment was poor. Stocks opened lower and immediately proved unsustainable. Mei Ya and China Silk were the first to hit limit down, while Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank rose to limit up due to buying from number 31. Rui Di and Yong Sha were sold off together by numbers 145, 223, 133, 224, 183, 65, 117, 36, and 231. Evening news reported news of loans, and prices fell further to 6080 yuan. Numbers 152, 129, and 30 took advantage of the low price to enter the market, and prices rebounded to 6250 yuan. Later, Da Tong, Matches, Yong Gong, China Textile, Cement, and spot Yong Sha all hit limit down. Panic had already set in, and numbers 117, 153, 160, 16, 237, 68, and 223 shorted again. Rui Di and Yong Sha fell to 5800 yuan. Numbers 231, 183, 152, 231, and 76 took advantage of the low price to absorb the supply again, and prices rebounded to 5930 yuan. Xin Ya also hit limit down, and numbers 223, 94, 232, and 16 cut their losses. At the close, Rui Di and Yong Sha also hit limit down. After the close, prices continued to fall to 5650 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Sha, Xin He, Mei Ya, and Yong Gong hit limit down. Qin Xing briefly rebounded after hitting limit down, and Xin Guang and Jing Fu each fell by slightly more than 10%, and Xin Hua fell by slightly less than 5%. In deferred delivery trading, Yong Sha, Mei Ya, and Yong Gong hit limit down, Xin He fell by slightly more than 5%, and Xin Guang, Jing Fu, and Qin Xing fell slightly. Cold stock Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank rose to limit up alone, and Wu He rose to limit up and then declined slightly. Jing Lun fell by 10%, and the rest of the stocks all hit limit down.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Rise</h3>
<p>National bonds rose yesterday as the date for the decision on the repayment of pre-war deposits at a multiple was approaching, which improved sentiment slightly. Unified Class C bonds opened at 16,700 yuan, and rooms 119, 408, and 555 absorbed the supply, and prices rose to 18,300 yuan. Rooms 550, 251, and 360 took profits at the high, and prices eventually hovered around 17,500 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Class A and B bonds rose by 1,000 yuan, Unified Class C bonds rose by 1,800 yuan, Class D bonds rose by 2,100 yuan, and Class E bonds also rose by 1,600 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 7 to 8 million.</p>
<h3>City Councilors Pay Attention to Stock Exchange Dynamics</h3>
<p>City councilors such as Chen Gongda proposed to the City Council yesterday to abolish the Stock Exchange in order to stabilize public sentiment. Dozens of people co-signed the proposal. It is said that some councilors believe that abolishing the exchange may not be necessary, but deferred delivery must be stopped because buying and selling short is too speculative and is not suitable for the current environment.</p>
<h3>Textile Control Committee to Hold Regular Meeting Today to Discuss Cotton Yarn Purchase Price</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Textile Control Committee is scheduled to hold a regular meeting at the Municipal Government this afternoon at 3:00 PM. The main agenda item is still to discuss the new price for cotton yarn. Once a decision is made, it will be submitted to the central authorities for approval before implementation.</p>
<p>The purchase price and free trade price for cotton yarn in April have not yet been agreed upon by the price negotiation group of the Shanghai Six District Cotton Textile Association, so the central authorities have temporarily decided that the price of 20-count standard yarn is 4.6 million yuan per piece. After this price was announced, various factories believed that it was still far from sufficient based on the current cotton prices. In order to maintain the prospects of the factories' reproduction, some advocated negotiating the price based on the reproduction cost. Therefore, although the price negotiation group has not officially convened meetings in recent days, it is reported that the private yarn factories have reached a new price negotiation plan after several consultations. Based on the 20-count standard yarn, each piece of yarn requires three and a half dan of raw cotton, with a cost of 1.6 million yuan per dan, and a processing fee of 1.8 million yuan per piece, plus a 20% legal profit. Therefore, the cost of each 20-count standard yarn is more than 7.5 million yuan. It is reported that the production cost of 20-count yarn at the China Textile Construction Corporation is about 1 million yuan per unit of raw cotton, based on the company's current cotton usage, one-third of which is foreign cotton and two-thirds is domestic cotton. The processing fee is 1.2 million yuan per piece, plus a 20% legal profit, and the cost of each 20-count yarn is more than 5.6 million yuan. Therefore, the cost price is closely related to the price of raw cotton used and the processing fee standard. Related parties predict that the new price will inevitably find a suitable and reasonable standard in these two cost prices.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Turns Upward, Fabric Sales Remain Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market rebounded and rose, mainly because the China Textile Construction Corporation opened yarn, and the number of allocations was not large, and only once a week. With the slight easing of credit, buyers resumed their activities, leading to higher prices. The final price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 12.8 million yuan, up 600,000 yuan. 20-count Special Double Horse was 7.1 million yuan, also up 600,000 yuan. Other 20-count and 16-count yarns also rose by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton fabric market in the morning, retail investors made up for Si Jun Zi and Jin Yin Piji, and various parties also had a strong buying interest, with prices at 5,500 yuan. Various grades of fine cloth declined by 5,000 yuan to 9,000 yuan, except for Wu Fu. Fu Chou and Bleached Cloth sales were sluggish, and prices all declined by about 5,000 yuan. The China Textile Construction Corporation supplied more than 30 types of cloth as usual, with fine Long Tou cloth priced at 2.67 million yuan. Printed Fu Chou and Ramie yarn were limited to applications from retail stores, and the number of applications from various fabric stores was not large.</p>
<h3>Rayon Rises, Mill-made Silk Goods are Weak</h3>
<p>The price of rayon remains firm due to the pending allocation. The market opened flat yesterday. Number 120, Gao Shan You Guang, first bid to buy at 7.5 million yuan and sold at 7.8 million yuan, then rose again, reaching a maximum of 8.8 to 8.9 million yuan, and closed at 8.4 million yuan. In the afternoon, it gradually softened as the mill-made market declined again, and finally closed at 8 million yuan, up 600,000 yuan from the previous day. Number 75, semi-glossy cone yarn, was traded at 25 million yuan.</p>
<p>Mill-made prices were 400,000 to 500,000 yuan lower than the previous day. There were ten bales traded yesterday. Grade E was priced at 18.65 million yuan. There were no transactions for grades ABCD.</p>
<p>The silk goods market remained weak yesterday. Da Cheng bedspreads opened at 8.5 million yuan, down 200,000 yuan from the previous day. Ge Zi Chou had a minimum price of 30,500 yuan, a maximum price of 2,500 yuan, and a final bid to sell at 1,500 yuan, down 1,500 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Hankou Merchants Arbitrage Shanghai Remittances</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to news from Hankou, a large number of banknotes are flowing out of Hankou every day to Guangzhou to arbitrage Shanghai remittances. 780 yuan is paid in Guangzhou, and 1,000 yuan can be drawn in Shanghai. Therefore, a profit of 22.2 million yuan can be made for every 100 million. It is said that the round-trip travel expenses for flying to Shanghai to withdraw cash are only 2 million yuan. As a result, the number of people engaged in this arbitrage is increasing daily.</p>
<h3>The People's Food Problem Needs to Be Resolved Urgently: The Rice Market Is Stalled Invisibly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Director of the Social Bureau Wu Kaixian went to Beijing yesterday to negotiate with the Ministry of Food about the people's food problem in this city and is scheduled to return to Shanghai on Monday. New decisions can be expected at that time.</p>
<p>The source of rice has not been smooth, and the amount of goods arriving yesterday was still scarce. Due to the recent rush to buy rice, rice merchants are afraid to buy rice. Yesterday, they also went to the municipal government to petition, so market transactions were invisibly stalled, and many rice stores were also closed. Yesterday, a total of 2,146 shi of goods arrived at the north and south markets. High-quality white japonica rice was priced at 298,000, and medium-quality rice was priced at 290,000. High-quality Bo Dao rice was priced at 297,000, and medium-quality rice was priced at 290,000. High-quality early rice was priced at 290,000, and medium-quality rice was priced at 285,000. High-quality Yang Xian rice was priced at 290,000, and medium-quality rice was priced at 280,000. High-quality milled Xian rice was priced at 270,000, and medium-quality rice was priced at 260,000, and inferior rice was priced at 245,000. High-quality Bai Yuan rice was priced at 305,000, medium-quality rice was priced at 295,000, and inferior rice was priced at 290,000. Medium-quality Yin Yuan rice was priced at 295,000.</p>
<p>The authorities allocated 9,000 bags of rice, which were originally scheduled to be sold in the North Market yesterday, but the allocation was temporarily suspended because all the rice merchants went to the Municipal Government to petition.</p>
<p>There were slight fluctuations in the flour market. Western flour was flat, and unified flour fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and the factories were holding firm. Bran sales were active, but prices remained stable. Soybean sales were normal, high prices were fixed and inferior prices were reduced, and medium and low prices fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Green beans had little inflow or outflow, and high-quality goods still rose by 3,000 yuan, and medium and inferior transactions were sluggish. Broad beans were very popular due to the transition between new and old crops, and prices soared by 10,000 yuan. Corn, alcohol, and sandy products were cold and sluggish, and prices plummeted by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Red sorghum also fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts had weak demand from both local and foreign sources, and prices fell by 10,000 yuan. Sesame had little spirit and lacked transactions. The oil market's demand from stores turned stronger, and the factory's supply was also abundant, creating a situation of strong supply and demand. Raw oil and soybean oil rose by 10,000 yuan, sesame oil also rose by 10,000 yuan, but medium and inferior raw soybean oil remained mediocre, and rapeseed oil was flat.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market Is Quiet Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market saw sellers of various export teas unwilling to sell lightly, and they all took a wait-and-see attitude, making the market even quieter. As for the flavored teas that are exclusively for domestic sale, in addition to jasmine, da fang, and slightly baked green teas, which were still favored by the Tianjin merchants, the rest only had sporadic transactions. As the supply and demand of the process became balanced, the ups and downs were less than before. According to people in the industry: Currently, Yingkou, Tianjin, and other places have a strong demand for last year's Huizhou baked green tea. At the same time, the Qingdao merchants also favor the 35-year Bailin black tea, but the inventory in the market is rare.</p>
<h3>Sugar Rises After Falling</h3>
<p>The sugar market initially softened yesterday because the Taiwan Sugar Company had begun to resume distribution. Peruvian fine sand fell to 358,000 yuan, and then returned to 385,000 yuan. No. 24 coarse white fell by 25,000 yuan, No. 20 medium sand fell by 40,000 yuan, half-car white fell to less than 370,000 yuan at the lowest, three-quarter car white was only 360,000 yuan, Xinghua white was 360,000 yuan to 380,000 yuan, also down 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, Xing red was 280,000 to 290,000 yuan, down 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, Taiwan red was 290,000 yuan, down 20,000 yuan, Huizhou green was 240,000 to 50,000 yuan, and Diao green was bid at 240,000 yuan, but no transactions were made. In the afternoon, news came that the Taiwan Company's distribution volume could not be increased, so Peruvian fine sand rose again, exceeding the 400,000 yuan mark, and the market may not be easy to loosen.</p>
<h3>Retail Kerosene to Be Calculated by Volume</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Measurement and Inspection has stipulated that all kerosene retailers in the city must switch to calculating kerosene by volume instead of weight in order to avoid fraud and ensure uniformity. Each can will be 30 catties, and the volume for retail sales will be one liter, which is 500 CC. The deadline for replacing the measuring equipment is the end of May. All kerosene retail stores must complete the replacement procedures within the deadline. The bureau will conduct inspections from June onwards, and those who deliberately violate or delay compliance will be punished according to regulations.</p>
<h3>Dodge Trucks Surge in Price</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The price of Dodge (DODGE) three-and-a-half-ton trucks has also risen with the surge in black market foreign exchange. The current price is more than 50 million yuan per vehicle.</p>
<h3>Securities Firms Fully Selling Off Foreign Stocks: Consistent Decline Yesterday</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks declined consistently yesterday due to the rebound of Hong Kong-Shanghai Telephone and Telegraph and the deterioration of the stock market. The absorption by the northern traders and retail buyers could not resist the full sell-off by securities firms. Qian Dui Ye initially entered and then exited. Yi Sha opened at 84,000 yuan and gradually declined from 85,200. In the afternoon, it ended at a low price of 65,000 yuan. With the exception of Ye Guang, which did not decline significantly, almost all stocks fell sharply. As a result, compared to the previous close, Shipping fell by 25%, Yi Sha, Ying Lian Paper, and Steel each fell by 20%, Ye Guang declined slightly, and the rest all fell by slightly more than 10%.</p>
<h3>How to Allocate Civilian Coal: The Allocated Amount Is Too Far From the Applied Amount</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Civilian Coal Allocation Committee held its first meeting at the Bank of China Building yesterday afternoon. Representatives from nine units, including the Fuel Management Committee, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce Guidance, the Garrison Command, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau of Public Utilities, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, the Coal Industry Association, and the Machine-made Coal Ball Industry Association, attended the meeting, which was chaired by Xu Letian, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee. It is reported that the Fuel Management Committee can allocate 20,000 tons of bituminous coal and 9,000 tons of white coal for civilian use this month. The allocation method for bituminous coal has been determined to be 15,000 tons for private factories and 5,000 tons for the Coal Industry Association. The allocation method for white coal has been determined to be 6,000 tons for the Coal Ball Industry Association and 3,000 tons for the Coal Industry Association. However, the amount applied for by each industry far exceeds this number. For example, the monthly application amount of the Industrial Association is as high as 80,000 tons. Therefore, the meeting openly discussed the allocation method for the amount of coal that can be allocated for civilian use this month and decided on the allocation method.</p>
<h3>Statistics on National Bank and Exchange Reserves in March</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the comparative table of the total amount of deposits and reserves of banks and exchanges across the country released by the Audit Department of the Central Bank, the total amount of deposits in March was 1,126,429,909,844.03 yuan, a sharp increase of one time compared to the 613,889,490,595.50 yuan in January. It increased by almost one-third compared to the 754,092,690,405.98 yuan in February. Among the total amount of deposits in March, demand deposits accounted for 1,008,866,319,590.73 yuan, and time deposits accounted for 117,563,590,253.36 yuan. The reserves paid for these deposits were 163,316,477,831.16 yuan.</p>
<h3>Raw Material Market Turns Firm</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The raw material market softened briefly the day before yesterday. Yesterday, as the Hong Kong exchange rate rose again, it stimulated a return to firmness. There were few sellers, and prices were still difficult to lower. Vaseline and some unpopular raw materials had strong demand from Shantou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other merchants, and prices rose sharply again.</p>
<h3>Three Principles Agreed Upon for the Allocation of Raw Material Foreign Exchange for Vulcanization</h3>
<p>The Chemical Raw Materials Industry Association sent representatives Wang Shouheng and seven others to discuss with the Provisional Management Committee for Imports the foreign exchange allocation method for raw materials for vulcanization in the second quarter. The representatives immediately presented (1) the foreign exchange to be allocated will be given to vulcanization manufacturers, and the association will provide certification and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce Guidance will supervise the reasonable allocation according to the actual production situation of each factory. (2) Importers and foreign raw material factories can jointly bid with the vulcanization manufacturers, the association, and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce to determine the price. (3) The vulcanization produced by each factory can be supervised by the association and the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and supplied to the dyeing and weaving industry and the members of each industry association in a reasonable manner, but must not be sold to hoarders. The above three principles will be submitted to the Advisory Committee for Import Management for review.</p>
<h3>Knitwear Industry Reduces Work: Currently in the Off-Season</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to people in the knitwear industry: The industry has recently been affected by: (1) The sharp rise in black market yarn prices, which has led to raw materials being more expensive than finished products, affecting the industry's production. (2) The amount of yarn allocated by the China Textile Construction Corporation is only one-third of the industry's actual needs. (3) The season has entered the off-season, and only undershirts are still in season. For this reason, since April, half of the industry has been reducing work, with a production volume of about 60% to 70% of the original production volume. It is reported that hosiery is the largest part of the knitwear industry. Recently, due to the general price increase, the price of ordinary 32-count plain medium-length socks is about 60,000 yuan per dozen, which is only the highest price in mid-February (peak season). According to past practice, the peak season for socks gradually declines after Qingming, when the farming season begins, and the recent firm market is actually driven by the general price increase. As for the export business of the industry, a few people are still engaged in operations, but it is said that most of them are starting with barter trade. Otherwise, with the current official exchange rate and the black market price difference widening day by day, it is more difficult to expect export trade to develop.</p>
<h3>Paper Merchants Hold Goods and Do Not Sell: Newspaper Prices Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The price of newsprint has continued to rise sharply recently. Canadian newsprint has reached 4,500 yuan per pound, and a double-sized sheet is also priced at between 230,000 and 240,000 yuan per ream. According to people in the industry, in order to maintain the capital of the paper in stock, general paper merchants will first replenish their stock if they sell it during this period of price fluctuations. As it is currently difficult to replenish stock, most of them hold goods and do not sell. Moreover, the black market foreign exchange has continued to rise sharply, so paper prices have also gradually risen.</p>
<h3>Pharmaceutical Industry Raw Material Allocation Should Be Handled by the Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association believes that the amount of raw materials approved by the Ministry of Railways and Transportation is only 600,000 yuan, which is far from the actual needs. Therefore, a standing committee meeting was held the day before yesterday, chaired by Chairman Gu Kemin, and it was resolved to submit to the relevant agencies that all raw material allocation and raw material designation matters should be handled by the association in order to avoid exploitation and encroachment by middlemen and merchants. Representatives will be sent to meet with the authorities to state the difficulties.</p>
<h3>Oils and Waxes Rise Together</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Industrial oils and fats are rising every day, sales are increasing, and the price of incoming goods is high. Yesterday, the price of asphalt rose again due to the fact that the Hankou remittance fee was 83% off. He Ben was bid at 850,000 yuan, Jing Bai was bid at 680,000 yuan, and Ma Cheng was bid at 660,000 yuan. The cargo owners firmly refused to sell, which was one and a half times higher than the previous month. The cargo owners of butter are firmly confident, and yesterday the market bid at 1 million yuan outside the customs, and there were no goods to buy. Coconut oil was 1.2 million yuan, and there were some transactions, which was twice the price of 420,000 yuan last month. Sichuan wax became a ball-like commodity, and retail investors' purchases and sales were erratic. Yesterday, the market soared to extreme levels, and the price of Mi Xin Da Bing had risen to 6 million yuan per unit.</p>

<h3>On the Question of Instilling Common Medical Knowledge (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Before discussing the question of how to instill common medical knowledge, we must first clarify the significance of instilling such knowledge.</p>
<p>Why should we undertake this task of instilling common medical knowledge? What is the significance of this work? Simply put, the main significance of instilling common medical knowledge is nothing more than the following points: (1) To popularize the various aspects of new scientific medicine that the public should understand, so that they understand the value of new medicine and are more likely to accept its treatment, and thus enjoy the benefits of new medical care. (2) To correct non-scientific medical concepts, making them aware that the theories of past traditional medicine are mostly unscientific, and the methods of treatment are even more outdated; in this new era of the 20th century, traditional medicine not only fails to fully assume the responsibility of medical treatment, but also cannot even be considered capable of fulfilling the great task of preventing disease and promoting health for the people. (3) To enable the general public, who have always lacked common medical and hygiene knowledge, to acquire the necessary daily hygiene and medical knowledge, so that they can take preventive measures before becoming ill, and know how to deal with and recuperate after becoming ill, in order to improve personal health and prolong the average lifespan of the population.</p>
<p>These points are the reasons why we should undertake the work of instilling common medical knowledge.</p>
<p>However, in order to achieve the goal of this great work and obtain its desired effects, we must have appropriate methods, in order to have the hope of achieving it and the possibility of obtaining it.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot avoid discussing the question of how to instill common medical knowledge.</p>
<p>Whether the method of instilling this common medical knowledge is appropriate or not is the key to whether we can achieve the great goal of instilling common medical knowledge, and the crux of whether we can obtain the satisfactory effects of instilling common medical knowledge.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is no absolutely fixed method for instilling common medical knowledge; however, in general or in principle, there should be a rough method.</p>
<p>The so-called instilling common medical knowledge refers to the general public outside the medical field; in other words, the target of our instilling work is the masses, the general public who lack medical knowledge, not medical practitioners within the medical field. Therefore, when we are doing the instilling work, we must never forget that we are speaking to the public; that is, the topics we propose for instilling medical knowledge must be aimed at the public; they must not only be needed by the public, but also be considered understandable and digestible by the general public!</p>
<p>Such medical knowledge topics that are both needed by the general public and can be understood and digested by the public can be regarded as methods that comply with the principles of instilling medical knowledge. Only by applying such methods that comply with the principles of instilling medical knowledge can we achieve the purpose of instilling and obtain the effects of instilling.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if you use words intended for the medical field itself, or specialized medical topics to speak to the public, or as instilling topics for the general public, on the one hand, they will not only not be needed by the public, but also will not be easily understood and digested by the public. As a result, not only will the writer waste effort, but the reading public will also waste time. This is called futile and unrewarding, making great efforts but not achieving good results. Wouldn't this be inconsistent with our original purpose? Of course, there is no hope of achieving the original purpose of instilling medical knowledge.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I wrote an article in this publication entitled "Medical Newspaper Articles and Magazine Articles." The meaning of that article was that all medical articles can be roughly divided into two categories: one category is written for people in the medical field themselves, and is academic writing of a specialized nature. These types of writings are mostly published in specialized medical magazines. I assumed a name for them, calling them "magazine articles"; the other category is written for the general public outside the medical field. This type of popular writing for the public is more suitable for publication in newspaper supplements, so I gave it another name, calling it "newspaper articles."</p>
<p>Magazines, of course, do not necessarily have to be entirely dedicated to specialized academic articles, and can certainly be used for popular medical knowledge articles; however, medical articles in newspapers should only be suitable for popular medical knowledge articles. If specialized academic articles are published, then they are somewhat inappropriate.</p>
<p>The textual method of instilling common medical knowledge mentioned here is, needless to say, belongs to the category of popular newspaper articles. Because the so-called newspaper articles are popular articles written for the general public who lack medical knowledge, and their purpose does not go beyond the six characters of "instilling common medical knowledge."</p>
<p>Regarding the writing style or work goal of instilling common medical knowledge, the public should be the target, and it must be suitable for the public's taste in order to reap the benefits of the instilling work; otherwise, if medical articles discussed by the medical field itself, or academic articles used for self-study, are used to publicize to the public and instill them to the masses, it will only be a waste of effort and futile. This has already been said above.</p>
<h3>Talking About Infantile Spasms</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuping</p>
<p>Infantile Spasms, also known as "Slow Spleen Wind," is a disease name defined by traditional medicine. Almost everyone knows this term because it is a formidable enemy of children. Every year, no less than tens of millions die from this disease! No wonder traditional doctors are disheartened when they see it. According to traditional theories, it is believed that prolonged diarrhea can lead to this disease, because the internal damage is already severe, and the stomach qi is weak, leading to this condition. Traditional doctors mainly focus on tonifying the spleen for this disease, and are generally at a loss for effective treatments. In fact, the occurrence of this disease is entirely due to the excessive loss of water and minerals in the body. In all cases where the body fluid is reduced due to vomiting, diarrhea or other reasons, new medicine defines it as dehydration. This dehydration is infantile spasm. The clinical symptoms of dehydration are most obvious in infants. Its symptoms are: (1) dry skin, losing elasticity, more obvious in the skin of the abdomen; (2) sunken eyes, sunken fontanelle; decreased urination; (4) mental confusion, with stiff neck and convulsions and other symptoms; (5) deep and long breathing, like a sigh, which is a sign of acidosis; (6) the skin, lips, or fingernails are cyanotic; (7) body temperature can rise to about 40 degrees; (8) rapid weight loss, etc. Regarding the principle of dehydration, because it belongs to the scope of pathology, and not the scope of common sense, it would be a long story to tell, so I will omit it for the time being. The most important principle of treatment is nothing more than providing fluids to restore the body's blood volume to normal, blood circulation can be improved, urine output increases, so that excessive acidic radicals in the body can combine with alkali and be excreted in the urine, which can avoid the occurrence of acidosis. The treatment of the pathogens of dehydration, such as the elimination of infectious diseases, is indeed the key point for doctors to treat diseases.</p>
<h3>A Word to the China Medical Association</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhengxing</p>
<p>The 7th Annual Meeting of the China Medical Association will open in Nanjing on May 5th. This is the first conference of the association since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Undoubtedly, this is also an epoch-making annual meeting. Therefore, the focus of the annual meeting is on how to cooperate with the course of national construction, give play to the function of medicine, and enable the Republic of China to embark on a smooth road to prosperity, strength, and happiness. The mission and task of this annual meeting are themselves arduous and significant. Because in the history of Chinese medicine, and in the basic national policy, the brilliant deeds of the "public medical system" should be written in the future, and no longer the "transaction behavior" of private doctors. Therefore, how can the medical community itself overcome the shackles of the past? How to promote the success of the public medical system? How to devote oneself to the national health cause? This is certainly the main topic for discussion at the Medical Association, and at the same time, it determines what to abandon and what to follow. Now, I sincerely wish the 7th Annual Meeting of the China Medical Association a success, so that it can actively promote the early realization of the "public medical system" in China.</p>
<p>Writing about this made me recall the Joint Annual Meeting of National Educational and Academic Groups in the summer of 1945, held in Beibei, Chongqing. At the closing ceremony, someone proposed: "Resolutions of the annual meeting submitted to the Ministry of Education for reference and implementation should be reported on the degree of implementation at the next annual meeting." After the proposal was put forward, the entire body unanimously supported and passed it, and it was immediately approved for execution by Minister Chen Lifu, who attended the meeting, maintaining a close relationship with each other.</p>
<p>After this incident happened, I felt that this proposal was not surprising. Minister Chen's willingness to accept this proposal was also not surprising, but it was surprising that this proposal could be "unanimously supported and passed." In the past, many academic groups in China repeatedly claimed that they would not interfere in politics, and only engage in "academic pursuit" for the sake of academic pursuit. If this idea cannot be regarded as closing oneself off from the outside world, nor can it be regarded as reinventing the wheel, it will always have a taste of "protecting oneself by being wise," that is, "not interfering with each other." Whether this kind of thinking can still exist in the current society is indeed worth questioning. The more advanced the society, the more complex, closer, more difficult to divide, and more difficult to isolate the relationship between people. The United States, which watched the First World War from across the ocean, actively cooperated with the Allied countries in the Second World War to fight against the Nazi and Japanese bandits. The United Kingdom is now in a leading position for world security and peace, which proves that the style and thinking of "Shangri-La" and "security is a blessing" no longer conform to the current social situation. When Hitler was the dictator of Germany, German scholars were unwilling to be tools of Nazi crimes. Scholars were safe, but ambitious people were restless. "Academic pursuit for the sake of academic pursuit" is still an illusion!</p>
<p>At the same time, the country's academic administration of this academic group should not be observed, but should be worked hard together. Because if politicians control the administration related to academics, they will inevitably use it as a tool for political struggle, and failure is inevitable. We naturally attribute this to the shamelessness of politicians, but we should also attribute it to the people who engage in this kind of academic work, who are perfunctory, careless, and do not actively strive for the initiative to take responsibility. Instead, they sing the high tune of academic pursuit, but let academics be torn to pieces in the hands of demons. At this time, we are sad for academics, especially for the academics who are "walking dead"!</p>
<p>Although the above view is general and has no specific target, according to this view, it proves that its thinking violates the times and has no need to exist. It can also be used as a reference for the present. Therefore, it is hoped that at the 7th Annual Meeting of the China Medical Association, it should practically take responsibility for issues related to health administration, and the medical community must actively shoulder the mission of national health. This is not an interference with the promotion of the cause, but a more practical assistance to the promotion of the cause. From the current situation in China, the future Minister of Health must be a layman. Regardless of his ability, if he is allowed to act "self-righteously", after thousands of years, the health cause will not only not achieve success, but the chronic deterioration may even lead to the extinction of the species. The "public medical system" is undoubtedly a promissory note, but the only way is that the medical community should wake up and take the initiative, and should stand at the forefront of the health cause.</p>
<p>At present, China is a society ruled by people, not a society ruled by law. To promote the cause on the right track, reasonably and effectively, a kind of power is of course needed; this kind of power is the people. To give play to this kind of power, it is more of a collective behavior. The stipulations on health policies in the constitution are mostly inappropriate. During the constitutional period, health construction will still be allowed to be carried out arbitrarily, and it may not be as ideal. What's more, my country's public health cause has no foundation, lacks talents, and has poor equipment. Especially, the general public regards health as unimportant, and believes that medical and health care is nothing more than cleaning and treating diseases. This kind of base concept is often held by those in power. This kind of erroneous concept is actually the current enemy of the health cause, and should not continue to exist. The Medical Association should stand on its own position and use collective action to solve the health problems of the Chinese people. The China Medical Association should shoulder this arduous responsibility.</p>
<p>There is no distinction between scholarship and practice. Develop practice in scholarship and strive for scholarship in practice. Therefore, the scholarship of practice is practical and great. If you simply move foreign things into China, it will only add to the spectacle, and will not be of any benefit to the Chinese people. The best way is for Chinese medicine to cooperate with China's health cause, and advance side by side, study China's medical and health problems, and the needs and applications of technology. Only then will there be hope for health construction, and Chinese medicine will make progress. Otherwise, Chinese medicine will not be the tail of the United Kingdom and the United States, but the echo of Germany and Japan. Therefore, it is hoped that scholarship will not be divorced from the actual health cause, but will need close and harmonious steps.</p>
<p>In order to maintain and promote the health of the entire nation, and in order to promote the independence of Chinese medicine, I ask the China Medical Association to have a new decision and a new style, to actively connect with practical matters, and to unhesitatingly believe that health construction is a part of its own responsibility. The health administration authority is only an agent, and the main body is still in the medical community. Therefore, we must urge, lead, and supervise the health administration authority, and call on them to be based on the spirit and purpose of "public medicine" so that all Chinese people can enjoy the benefits of medical and health care, and do not let them "become officials" and "get rich". The China Medical Association should do this, and only in this way can it be worthy of people's praise. Otherwise, the usual meetings, resolutions, and declarations will still be met with people's scorn and contempt.</p>
<p>This small suggestion is issued from the depths of my heart. Of course, the wording may be inappropriate, but I am indeed full of good intentions, hoping that the Chinese medical community will flourish and that the Chinese people will be healthy and strong!</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Rabies (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chen Jindou</p>
<p>Since we already know that rabies is an infectious disease, does that mean that after being bitten by a rabid dog (should be collectively called a diseased animal), it will immediately develop the disease? No, after being bitten, before the official onset of the disease, there is a silent period in between, called the incubation period (Incubationszeit). The length of this period is quite uncertain. According to general statistics, the shortest is at least two or three weeks, and the longer ones can be half a year or more than two or three years, with an average of about fifty or sixty days. When bitten by a rabid dog, if it is not infected by his saliva, it will not cause the disease; or if the bitten area does not invade the nerves, it is unlikely to cause the disease, because the lymphatic vessels and blood vessels are not its main transmission routes; the chance of developing the disease is greatly reduced if the bite is through clothing or socks. The length of the incubation period also varies depending on the type of diseased animal and the location of the bite; if bitten by a diseased animal of a carnivorous animal (such as dogs, wolves, foxes, and cats), it will develop the disease faster and more severely, especially wolf bites are more serious than dog bites, which may be related to the size and depth of the wound. If bitten by the same diseased animal and get sick, then the incubation period of being bitten in the arm will be shorter than that of being bitten in the foot and leg, and the incubation period of being bitten in the head and face will be even shorter, meaning that the closer the bite wound is to the central nervous system, the faster the disease will develop. As for the strength of one's own resistance, it can of course affect the length of the incubation period. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Reading the Medical Practitioner Law</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin, Record by Song Enhao</p>
<p>In recent years, I have been living in seclusion in my hometown, not seeking fame and fortune, preserving my life, and reading books behind closed doors. Yesterday, the Shanghai Medical Practitioner Association sent me a copy of the current Medical Practitioner Law, which I received and read; I bowed again and said: "Alas, is this the Medical Practitioner Law that we have been running around calling for day and night for the past twenty years? How disappointing it is!" Please explain it in detail:</p>
<p>(1) Violating the Simplified Law: According to foreign countries, anyone who graduates from a formal medical school and holds a national diploma can request a license from the local health authority to practice medicine, and the procedures are very simple. However, this is not the case in our country. According to the Medical Practitioner Law:</p>
<p>(1) After graduation, with the graduation diploma, first apply to the Examination Yuan for an examination or review, and issue a certificate of passing.</p>
<p>(2) With the certificate of passing from the Examination Yuan, apply to the Ministry of Health for a medical practitioner certificate.</p>
<p>(3) With the medical practitioner certificate, apply to the local county or city government for registration and issue a business license.</p>
<p>The complexity of the procedures sets a precedent that has never been seen in any country in the world—now that the government is promoting the simplification of laws, is this not going against it? This should be discussed.</p>
<p>(2) The law does not investigate the past: This Medical Practitioner Law was promulgated and implemented on September 21, 1943. Therefore, before this date, all doctors who have been recognized by the government for their qualifications and hold a medical practitioner certificate do not need to go through the examination or review of the Examination Yuan again. Because under the same government, once it has been recognized in the past, it cannot go back on its word in the future, breaking faith with the people. Now this Medical Practitioner Law does not have a clear provision. Is this not the meaning of the law not investigating the past? This should be discussed.</p>
<p>(3) Creating divergent medical practitioners: There are two sources of new doctors in our country: one is the formal doctors who graduated from school, and the other is the divergent doctors who did not graduate from school; however, this is only a temporary transitional phenomenon, and divergent doctors should not continue to be produced. Now Article 1 of this Medical Practitioner Law states: "Citizens of the Republic of China who pass the medical practitioner examination may serve as medical practitioners." Then, no matter who they are, they do not need to go through the school stage to serve as medical practitioners. Isn't this allowing divergent doctors to continue to be produced in an endless stream? This should be discussed.</p>
<p>(4) Unequal treatment for new and old doctors: This Medical Practitioner Law applies to both new and old doctors, but the treatment seems to be unequal. Article 3, Paragraph 1: "Chinese medicine practitioners who have obtained a certificate of qualification or a license to practice medicine from the central competent authority or the provincial or municipal government" or Paragraph 3: "Those who have practiced Chinese medicine for more than five years and have outstanding reputation" may apply for a medical practitioner review. However, there are many people in the new medical community who have these two qualifications, but they must go through the medical practitioner examination. There is this contradiction in the same Medical Practitioner Law. This should be discussed.</p>
<p>(5) Medical rights protection issues: In recent years, medical litigation cases have been heard from time to time, and business disputes have emerged one after another. What we hope for in the Medical Practitioner Law is to protect medical rights and reduce medical litigation. Although this law lists the rights to practice and organize associations, the provisions on medical rights: such as the use of anesthetic drugs, performing surgery, terminating pregnancy, dissecting corpses, identifying diseases and injuries, and the protection of final medical consultation fees and other issues, should be listed item by item and clearly stipulated. This should be discussed.</p>
<p>In summary, except for the fifth point, the rest are related to the medical practitioner examination issue. In fact, if the Examination Yuan wants to extend its authority to the medical community, it is not impossible; when the public medical system is implemented in the future, the appointment of doctors in each hospital at all levels, and the appointment of civil servants in local health institutions, must rely on the Examination Yuan. Because on the one hand, it can prevent private connections, and on the other hand, it can avoid the manipulation of one faction, which is a very good law. As for the examination for idle jobs, it seems to be a bit superfluous and unnecessary, and the examination is held regularly every year. Before the examination, one cannot practice medicine, or it is said that a temporary license can be used for relief, but the issuance of a temporary license also has intermittent characteristics. If it is not the right time, it is not easy to obtain. Alas! It is just a matter of starting a business, but it is so difficult. If it is not the fault of the Medical Practitioner Law, who else should be blamed?</p>

<h3>Memories of the Moscow Little Theatre</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>At a corner of Gorky Street, between Pushkin Square and Mayakovsky Square, there is a place often referred to as Mamonovsky Lane. Now it is called Sadovsky Lane. This is how Moscow respects the home of our actors, the Sadovsky lineage—(my grandfather Prov Mikhailovich, my father Mikhail Provich, and my mother Olga Asafovna, were all artists in the Moscow Little Theatre, which is the oldest and most famous in Russia.</p>
<p>I spent my childhood in my grandfather's old house in Mamonovsky Lane. In fact, the place we often went out to play from this lane was Petrovsky Park, just outside the city, where we had a small house. Our Sadovsky family was Muscovite to the core, and we were reluctant to leave Moscow even for a short trip to St. Petersburg, for example. There was no way to drag us out of Moscow. Only in times of hardship would my mother travel.</p>
<p>We were reluctant to leave Moscow, our strange and lovely city, where everyone knows everyone. I often drove to the Little Theatre for rehearsals or performances, constantly raising my hat, until my arm ached.</p>
<p>Everything in Moscow was lovely and familiar, and so were the people, who lived an old life with habits that were so delightful. Every year, it was customary to go to Maiden's Field to hold a carnival. There, grass huts were built, and variety shows were performed. Once, I saw a very sublime dramatic performance in this outdoor theatre. It was called "1812, or the Great Fire of Moscow". I remember a person imitating Napoleon's special personality and attitude. He wore green clothes and a grey tricorn hat, walking back and forth on the stage. Above his riding boots, something bulged, suggesting breeches. He put one hand in his waistcoat and the other behind his back. He uttered a sentence: "Am I going to Moscow?" After answering his own question with the word "Forward!", he quickly walked off the stage. Then blue fireworks were set off, representing the Great Fire of Moscow. That was the whole performance. But it didn't matter, the audience still flocked to this open-air theatre, longing for it very much.</p>
<p>Later, as an actor, I often remembered that performance and the audience—people eagerly longing for art, only able to satisfy themselves mostly with such substitutes.</p>
<p>The Little Theatre is only a stone's throw from Moscow University. We actors often thought of this proximity as symbolic. Aren't the ideas of the great humanists, which inspire the best and most progressive qualities of Moscow's professors and students, similar to ours?</p>
<p>Our great teacher, Ostrovsky, had already written about the need for genuine people's art in the 1880s. I also remember that one evening in February 1911, it suddenly seemed as if a dream had come true, or, more truly, as if people suddenly understood what a people's theatre should be like. At a concert, Ermolova recited a poem by Maikov. I wanted to know which poem she was reciting and was very surprised by her choice.</p>
<p>I asked, "Maria Nikolayevna, do you really want to recite that poem? It won't be effective when reciting it. Why do you want to do this?"</p>
<p>Ermolova just smiled and didn't answer.</p>
<p>She slowly walked towards the audience. "Look, a faint light is shining in that small grass hut..." She began to describe this scene with a moving and affectionate voice. We immediately had a vision before our eyes, as if a small peasant girl walked to the school gate, the first in her family to enter school to receive education and culture, which must be universal for the masses.</p>
<p>From the first word, the audience was as if bewitched. Every line of poetry increased the sighing and sincerity. Later, this artist reached the last two lines:</p>
<p>'Brothers, believe me, this is only the first step</p>
<p>Into the land of thought, where perpetual light shines.'</p>
<p>These words shook out, as if calling us to serve the people with art. The audience roared enthusiastically, and I was among them. I was shaken to the depths of my soul.</p>
<p>I thought: 'Yes, my dear, that is the great talent you have shown—as a warrior of the people.'</p>
<p>The most famous singer Chaliapin could become an actor in the people's theatre, in the broadest and most democratic sense of the term. This genius artist, whose glorious voice was united with profound acting skills, abandoned all traditions and trivial details, the dross often found in these operas. From his lips, even the most clichéd songs sounded like the expression of original emotion. This was in Russia, his homeland, and he knew and shared the tastes of these audiences, so he was able to reach the greatest and best heights. His emigration surprised us all. Once he left his homeland, which had made his art powerful and rich, he could no longer be the great Chaliapin.</p>
<p>Under Soviet power, we have been given golden opportunities to realize the desire to serve the people with art. New masses are coming to us. This brings its problems.</p>
<p>The playbill of the Royal Theatre, the decision-makers and managers, all knew exactly what the masses wanted and liked when they gathered in the gallery and the stalls to watch matinees on Sundays, and when they filled the square to watch grass-roots plays during carnivals. Actors know that a play that is successful for one type of audience may be a failure for another.</p>
<p>The audiences in Moscow and Leningrad reflect differently. We all know this. When we performed, a small group of democratic theatregoers wanted to seek the mission of art in the theatre, and listened eagerly to the great dramatists. But most of the audience who supported us did not care about the greatness and courage of thought, but only looked for entertainment in the theatre.</p>
<p>The new era has changed all this. Democratic audiences, filled with hope and anticipation, filled the theatre—the stalls, boxes, and galleries. The audience, with a receptive mind and a clear understanding of life, came to the theatre wanting to see something important. How should we cater to them? What kind of theatre would interest them?</p>
<p>Ilyich said to Clara Zetkin: 'Our workers and peasants have the right to demand something higher than the circus. They have the right to demand true art.'</p>
<p>We decided that the repertoire would be classical plays, excluding everything that was false and superficial. Soon after, we performed modern plays, and in 1918, we naturally found Gorky, whom we were often looking for. We chose one of his plays called 'The Old Man'.</p>
<p>On the first night, I was sitting in the actors' room when our old servant Vasily rushed to the curtain to tell me that a man and a woman had come in, followed by a soldier in a leather jacket. They put down their things and went straight to the director's office. Not knowing what was going on, the performer Platon and I went out. Sure enough, a soldier was standing in the front room.</p>
<p>We asked him, 'Who is here?'</p>
<p>'Ilyich and Krupskaya.'</p>
<p>We looked into the box. Sure enough, Ilyich and his wife were sitting in the back row. The front row had already been occupied by people approved by Platon. Platon walked up to Ilyich. Ilyich said, 'It seems we are sitting in the wrong place.'</p>
<p>Platon said, 'Ilyich, your seats are over there.' He pointed to the best box. Ilyich leaned forward slightly, looked at the box, and said, 'No, we want to be here. We are very comfortable here.'</p>
<p>Platon asked, 'Shall we ask the people sitting in front of you to move to another box?'</p>
<p>'No, why? There is no need. Don't worry about it. We are very comfortable here.'</p>
<p>Moscow has been rebuilt more beautifully. Sometimes, old Muscovites like me are reluctant to leave the narrow, winding streets and houses, because they hold so many memories. But I did not shed a tear at leaving the legacy of the old world, the forerunners of old Moscow, which is slumbering. I saw that the great plan to rebuild the capital had come to life again.</p>
<p>I am not far from the truth when I say that today's Moscow has become a holy place for theatre. During banquets, guests from all over the country come to us. Artists from almost every country come to visit us.</p>
<p>For a period of time, the Bourgeois Theatre let its stage to our guests, displaying strange oriental costumes, and resonating with unknown instruments from the distant Caucasus and the plains of Outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>In those times, we listened to 'Azerbaijan' in the Uzbek language, and saw the life given to the characters, without needing words to understand them. This sublime primitive culture enriches our art, what a great exchange it is, and how enthusiastically our audience accepts it!</p>
<p>Near the Little Theatre, a monument to the great Russian dramatist Ostrovsky has been erected. He sits in an armchair, close to our stage, as if quietly listening to the murmur of the great city, the music of the new era, stirring thoughts in his heart. Every time I walk into the theatre, I always tip my hat to the bronze Ostrovsky, as if he were still alive.</p>
<p>How surprised he must be to see the line of cars passing before him! It turns out we are setting out on a journey across the country. I imagine him there thinking:</p>
<p>'How far will my Little Theatre develop endlessly? Where will it expand to?'</p>
<p>I tell him: 'To the Palace of Culture in Leningrad—to Kiev, to Odessa, to Dnepropetrovsk, to Kharkov, with the entire troupe, and all the scenery, and your golden words, dear Alexander Nikolayevich!' (By Prov Sadovsky, USSR)</p>

<p>Do you believe that there is a utopia in the world now? And enchanting peach blossoms in brilliant red? That's a dream, an illusory dream that won't come true.</p>
<p>Times are different, it is progressing: the escape of the fisherman of Wuling is a combination of decline, withering, hesitation, and sorrow!</p>
<p>'After the war, the countryside is desolate,' unfortunately, what is there to praise except the flames of war and hunger? Many people die under the dual threats, and some people carry gold in piles of skulls; however, the proportion is too disparate...</p>
<p>The overflowing river water, the blood-red artillery shells, the empty granaries, the rubble of tiles... in the vast sandstorm beyond the pass, the sorghum is full of fields (but unfortunately, most of the land is empty!), in the Jiangnan where the grass grows and the orioles fly... no one can escape the doom of war or hunger.</p>
<p>I ask you: Where is the utopia?</p>
<p>Lamenter</p>
<p>Sorrow, indignation, loud protests, interwoven with a lonely and stubborn soul.</p>
<p>'Suicide is a sign of weakness,' I weep for the dead, and I place infinite expectations on the living. Don't sneer at it as a cliché, the truth is in it!</p>
<p>The old and reactionary will surely sink and decline, but it has not been completely destroyed, the new and progressive will surely rise, but it has not happily arrived in the world.</p>
<p>This is the darkness before dawn, the labor pains of the mother before the birth of a new life!</p>
<p>Loggers cut down the seedlings in the forest one by one, and this forest is about to become flat;</p>
<p>One by one, lives that are not full enough, given to the legacy of jackals, are devoured in the fourth watch, I am sad and indignant, but even more strengthen my firm belief.</p>
<p>—Strengthen the weak into the strong, and sow the seeds of new life before the light.</p>
<p>Crow</p>
<p>It's getting dark, and crows are circling above the city.</p>
<p>'Caw caw caw,' this is a threatening cry to the kind, the sparrows fly away far away when they hear it, and they laugh triumphantly.</p>
<p>'We have won, you little guys!'</p>
<p>Is the sky really as black as crows? No: beyond their circling sky, there is still a vast expanse of azure.</p>
<p>The sun is hiding behind the mountains, and the crows, one by one, timidly fly back to their old home in the dark night.</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be a sunny day.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 504</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>All these problems, of course, are like a tangled mess of silk, accumulating in Tsurumi's mind. Although he now has so many people helping him, it is a hundred times more secure than when he and Masao Iwato were alone, groping around like headless flies. Moreover, there is now some hope about Pingzi's whereabouts; someone has also promised to try to interpret that mysterious letter, so Tsurumi can certainly rest easier. However, even so, can Pingzi really be rescued from the bandit's den? Is it certain that Pingzi must be in one of these three "dens"? In other words, is it absolutely impossible for the other side to put Pingzi anywhere outside the three "dens"? Moreover, according to the representative of the Korean side, the other side's "警戒綫" is very solid, and if we send people to rescue her, a fierce battle will be unavoidable. The combined front going together from all sides will certainly be able to fight the other side, but the problem is, if the enemy fails, and given the base psychology of the Japanese, they might just kill Pingzi with a single shot. What then?</p>
<p>Moreover, if Pingzi cannot be rescued after midnight, even if the old man with the "覺T" can interpret the secret order, will Tsurumi be able to carry it out alone according to the order? Isn't that a big problem too? That is to say, without Pingzi, can Tsurumi himself bear the responsibility of executing the order alone? Even if there are three other parties willing to help with all their might, their abilities are certainly extremely strong, but they are definitely not the kind of ability that Pingzi has. It can be said for certain that even if all three parties are willing to sacrifice everything and take a gamble, if their methods are wrong and they can't muster their strength, wouldn't it be a waste?</p>
<p>Therefore, although Tsurumi felt half relieved after receiving the phone calls from all sides, he still couldn't feel completely at ease because of these two or three worrisome problems. At this time, Tsurumi was alone in his room in the large hotel, and there were only two major things to do: one, according to his old habit, he started pacing back and forth in the empty room; two, as he paced back and forth, he would look at the phone on the wall by the door almost every step of the way, hoping that a call would come in from outside.</p>
<p>Just as Tsurumi was feeling so anxious, he suddenly heard two soft knocks on the door, as light as a small woodpecker pecking at the door. Tsurumi stopped immediately when he heard the knocks. Because he hadn't heard clearly if someone was really knocking, and before he could answer, there were four more knocks. These four knocks were divided into two times, two knocks followed by a pause, and then two more knocks.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" Tsurumi asked, feeling strange: If it were a waiter from the hotel with something to enter the room, they would definitely not peck at the door like that. If it were one of the people who had already come, like Shouyi, they would probably push the door open without waiting for an answer from inside; in any case, they would never knock so lightly and so mysteriously. First two knocks, then another two knocks, sounding like some kind of agreed-upon code. Furthermore, if the person knocking was a stranger, the hotel would definitely send a waiter to lead them upstairs as usual, and there would be a phone call beforehand to ask if he was willing to see them. This kind of knocking method didn't seem to fall within any of these three categories; so Tsurumi asked again, feeling even stranger, "Who is it?"</p>
<p>Peck peck... peck peck... peck!</p>
<h3>A Marriage Advertisement</h3>
<p>— Bu Shu</p>
<p>A certain fourth-year student at National Central University recently published an advertisement in the Dagan Daily seeking a widow as a wife, regardless of anything else, but hoping to receive tuition fees.</p>
<p>This is the ebb and flow under the glamorous phenomenon of the city, stirred up by the "high prices" of the past year or two, and thus floated to the surface, appearing publicly as a "social problem" in a solemn manner. Some say this is a perversion of male prostitution, the incarnation of a pitiful worm kneeling before money and begging for life. Although the words are harsh, they reveal a bit of truth.</p>
<p>It is easy to imagine that upon seeing this advertisement, moralists will shake their heads and sigh, but there are too many things to sigh about these days, and there are too many news stories that deserve the feverish writing of "experts on yellow news." One day, because of "entering a room of orchids, one does not smell their fragrance after a long time," all strange and bizarre things will lose their infectiousness.</p>
<p>In universities, there are indeed many people who wear suits and leather shoes and spend money very lavishly, but there are many more poor students who wear patched long gowns year after year. This situation also reflects the face of the entire society, which is very common, but in this money-worshipping society, what is so strange about "seeking a widow as a wife"? What is strange is the purpose of his search—"only to provide tuition." Someone who has already submitted to money worship, someone who has succumbed to the cruelty of reality, someone who attempts to obtain tuition fees through marriage, still wants to continue his studies, which is too tragic.</p>
<p>The French writer André Gide could imagine the experiences and misfortunes of an old man walking along the road with his head down. Does anyone dare to imagine the experiences of the poor university student who published this advertisement? Hidden behind this advertisement may also be a great tragedy, a great pain.</p>
<p>—This is one of the money-worshipping scenes in a society where money worship is rampant. Good men and women may as well take a close look!</p>
<h3>Sugar and Tobacco</h3>
<p>— Yi Quan</p>
<p>Mr. Bu Shu talked about how Americans spent more than 500 million yuan on candy in the past ten months. I don't think this cost is very high. We can break it down: The US population is about 100 million, and the average person spends 5 yuan on candy in ten months, which means that each person spends 5 jiao on candy each month, equivalent to 6,000 yuan in legal tender. I don't think anyone would say that a basic Shanghai citizen wastes money by spending 6,000 yuan on candy each month. Indeed, Americans are more frugal than Chinese. Looking back at Shanghai, the high-class Chinese who spend millions of gold coins at a time, if we were to calculate their monthly expenses, it would be staggering! Why ask people to sweeten their mouths less, and let our own people spend millions of gold coins at a time? Furthermore, if we put aside candy, Mr. Bu Shu, if you have time, you might as well calculate the monthly consumption of cigarettes in Shanghai: Assuming that 500,000 of the 3.5 million people in Shanghai smoke, and each person consumes 20 cigarettes a day, with each 20 cigarettes averaging 2,500 yuan, the number would probably not be small! Moreover, 99% of the candy consumed by Americans is produced in their own country, and more than half of the cigarettes consumed by the Chinese are foreign goods, and most of the Chinese goods are produced by foreign factories in China. Alas! What more can I say!</p>

<h3>Second Symphony Concert</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>The second Municipal Symphony Concert was performed publicly at the Lyceum Theatre on May 11th. This time there was a very good program - it opened with Bach-Abert's Praeludium, Choral and Puga…Bach-Abert. The second was Purcell's Suite for strings only. Third, Haydn's Symphony No. 4 in D major (The Clock). Haydn was an important figure in the Classical period, and he made great contributions to later symphonies. His works are known for their elegance and fluency. He also has excellent works on sonatas and string quartets. But the most are symphonies, said to be more than one hundred and several types, the most famous are only twelve kinds. The fourth program is Saint-Saëns's Cello Concerto: First Concerto for Cello with Orchestra. The cello soloist is Shevtzoff. Saint-Saëns is also good at instrumental works, he is a famous modern French composer. The advantage of the concerto is that there is a solo to listen to, and there is also an orchestra to listen to, which is equally important for both parties. The fifth is Liadov's Eight Russian Folk-songs: Liadow: Eight Russian Folk-songs: (1) Sacred Song, (2) Koliada (Christmas Carol) (3) Lament, (4) Comic Song: I Have Dancek with a Gnat, (5) The Legend of the Birds, (6) Luilaby, (7) Round Dance, (8) Dancing Chorus. This is like eight small paintings.</p>
<p>This program includes several types of music; large ones include symphonies, small ones include folk songs. In terms of performance, there are solos, string ensembles, and orchestras; it is a very good concert. The program arrangement and conductor is the Italian Professor Arigo Foa.</p>
<p>Last time it was full and many people who arrived late were turned away, so this time it is better to go buy tickets in advance.</p>

<h3>New Medical Techniques for Transforming Personality</h3>
<p>— Jianhua</p>
<p>Medicine, like other natural sciences, is changing with each passing day and making significant progress. According to recent research, a person's personality can be transformed in essence using medical techniques, leading humanity towards evolution.</p>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that endocrine glands are related to the structure of the human body. It has also recently been confirmed by the medical community that the degree of development of the endocrine glands causes different personalities in each individual. For example, people with abnormally developed thyroid glands must have high nasal bridges and white skin, and they do not tire easily. For example, people with developed B-glands are bound to have calm minds and be scheming. In this experiment, new medicine can often determine a person's personality from how the endocrine glands develop.</p>
<p>However, new medical techniques can correct bad personalities. If the endocrine glands are overdeveloped, a type of light can be used to shrink them; if the endocrine glands are underdeveloped, a needle made from the endocrine glands can be used to supplement them. Therefore, Americans, based on this understanding of transforming personality, are planning to improve the evil nature of vicious criminals. It is said that among Japanese criminals, one-fifth belong to the "thymus lymphatic constitution." This constitution is because the thymus, which exists in the chest at birth, does not disappear at maturity (the thymus of ordinary people must disappear at maturity). It remains in the body, causing people to often have abnormal sexual desires, especially when they have various ambitions, are prone to suicide, and dare to kill. For this kind of inferiority, education is powerless other than new medical techniques.</p>
<h3>The Thief is Actually an Expert</h3>
<p>— Several Stems</p>
<p>The Hongkou Police Department of this city recently arrested a car thief, and upon investigation, it turned out he was a mechanical expert. He possessed extraordinary skills, had returned from overseas, and became a petty thief due to temporary difficulty in finding a job. Those who have read this news probably cannot help but feel regret.</p>
<p>We do not believe that there is already a surplus of such people in society, causing him to be unable to find a job. This may be possible in the United States, where there are too many experts, but it is definitely not the case in China. The reason why this person cannot find a job lies in the fact that our social organization is not rigorous enough, causing a useful person to be unable to go to a position that suits him and needs him. Now we do have several groups responsible for job placement, but most factories, businesses, and institutions still do not know how to utilize them, and they overlook the importance of this kind of introduction. However, their methods of hiring personnel have not deviated from the stage of introduction. However, this kind of introduction is only a narrow range of private introductions. From the perspective of talent acquisition, there is a great difference.</p>
<p>If not using introduction, then the method of examination should be used. This is a better way to employ people than introduction. Some people still appreciate the beauty of the Chinese imperial examination system, which is the role of talent selection in the examination. It gives those without connections in the court an opportunity to be promoted. Nowadays, the number of institutions that adopt the examination system to employ people is gradually increasing, but it is still not many. As a result, an unemployed person with ability cannot help but feel the pain of having no way to turn to. Under the pressure of life, those with weaker wills become indiscriminate. This car thief expert is an example.</p>
<p>We cannot deny that this person himself also has shortcomings. As the report says, he "usually frequents brothels" and "does not seek advancement," which is the root of his depravity. The ancients said, "Without desire, one is firm." This young man, going in and out of the brothel, naturally cannot stand up straight and has to succumb to the dark forces. However, when we think about the fact that he is "only twenty-seven years old" and probably did not receive much education in the decade before and after the Anti-Japanese War, his knowledge and cultivation may have always remained at the age of seventeen, or even regressed compared to that teenager, we should see that society really bears a considerable responsibility for him. Fortunately, he was arrested this time. We hope that in addition to bringing him to justice, we can make up for the education that society owes him, which would not only benefit him alone.</p>
<h3>Arts and Literature Scene</h3>
<p>The literary and artistic circles in Xi'an have been quite lonely recently. The "Camel Literature Series" literary monthly has been suspended due to economic reasons. The young writer Qingmiao has left Xi'an for Beiping, and Zheng Boqi, although in Xi'an, is also quite silent. However, several young artists and writers recently pooled their resources to publish a 16-page monthly journal, "New Literature and Art."</p>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>The famous Chinese painter Zhang Daqian is scheduled to hold an exhibition of his new works at the Chinese Painting Gallery on Chengdu Road from today until the 13th, with an attached exhibition of Zhang's copies of Dunhuang murals, which is particularly precious.</p>
<p>The fourth volume, fifth issue of "Literary Spring and Autumn Monthly," edited by Fan Quan and published by Yongxiang Printing House, will be published five days in advance on the tenth of this month. It is reported that the issue includes a record of the "May Fourth Literary Festival Forum," with participants including Chen Baichen, Xu Jie, Kong Lingjing, Liu Beisi, Fan Quan, An E, Zang Kejia, Shi Yi, and others.</p>

<p>Man A: Strange, foreigners respect women's rights, so why not elect a woman as president?</p>

<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>A batch of military vehicles from the ×× War Zone Command—five three-and-a-half-ton trucks—did not leave as usual yesterday. The vehicles on the highway, which are said to leave tomorrow, will at least leave the day after tomorrow. This is the formula; although fleeing is important these days, the old habits cannot be changed. Anyway, it is a waste of running back and forth, and the unlucky ones are the passengers, but it will not delay the affairs of their Quartermaster Masters.</p>
<p>It was originally said that the vehicles would stop on Huanxiang East Road, but one or two hundred passengers waited from five or six o'clock in the morning until twelve o'clock noon, without even seeing a wheel.</p>
<p>"The vehicles have not been repaired today and will leave tomorrow!" After much anticipation, two people who looked like drivers, wearing khaki-colored khaki Hawaiian shirts and matching trousers, came and said these two understated sentences.</p>
<p>"Will it leave early tomorrow?" "Where are the vehicles parked?" "Is it still here?" The guests asked their usual questions, but the two people just arrogantly replied:</p>
<p>"You just need to come and wait earlier tomorrow!"</p>
<p>When they wanted to ask further, they had already left without stepping on the ground; a few clever people hurried to catch up, offering cigarettes, and those who wanted to invite them to dinner quickly contacted them.</p>
<p>"Damn it! These bastards!" Zhang Chang and several young actors could not help but curse like this, but what could they do if the vehicles did not come? In the end, they could only carry their boxes and luggage like others and walk back dejectedly. Lao Zhu was the leader, and after returning, he certainly could not just curse like others; he had to bite the bullet and go to Director Xiong of the Transportation Department again. After half a day of negotiations, he was able to ask about the departure time and parking location the next night.</p>
<p>Today is the eve of the second emergency evacuation order announced by the authorities. Panicked crowds ran back and forth on the streets, pushing and shoving; even the native Guangxi people who did not intend to leave were frightened by the rapidly deteriorating situation. The two banks of the Xiang River were so crowded with them that they were like human walls, all wanting to take wooden boats to escape to the mountainous areas of Guishan.</p>
<p>The entire crew of the New China Theater Troupe arrived at the gate of the airport outside the South Gate before dawn. Five military vehicles were already waiting there, and two soldiers wearing extremely dirty military uniforms were guarding them, like subordinates of the drivers. Zhu Zhaonian handed them the boarding pass issued by the Transportation Department, thinking that there might be further difficulties, but the two soldiers did not even look at it, only nodded, and then lay on the ground, continuing to cook their breakfast with the picked-up dry branches. (Six or seven)</p>
