<h3>安邊之道應積極　着重對新交通綫</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前新疆建設廳長林繼庸對新省事件發表意見稱，安邊之通，應採取積極之政策：（一）應興建兩條並行之鐵路綫分別自甘肅及靑海勾通新省，造成一「複綫走廊」，如此方可避免三千里長之甘新公路。隨時彼人切斷之危險，如鐵路之興建緩不濟念時，亦需以大量飛機開闢航空綫。（二）應以廉能之官吏，推行健全之經濟政策，一切措施以增進全省人民福利為前提，不帶絲毫與民爭利之色彩。</p>

<h3>美報評新疆事件　同情我對蘇抗議</h3>
<p>〔中央社華總頓十四日電〕外蒙軍隊侵入新羅報道，迄未引起此間官方之反響。國務院刻等待詳細報吿，猶極端保持緘默。華盛頓明星報本日午社論中謂：「吾人甚有理由，認為（南京方面顯然認為如此）蘇聯對外蒙侵入新疆之行動，至少須負一部份責任。中國之向蘇聯抗議者不無理由。該外業之行動，在想像中司能係克里姆林宮於中國政府全力應付共產黨之際，擬以加重中國政府之困難之行動。蘇聯之解釋將為全球人士所關切期待者。</p>
<h3>中國正在苦難中　美不應失去關切　前聯總中國副署長稱</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十四日電〕前任聯總中國分署副署長福爾谷納，上星期在援華委員會發表演說稱：中國目前雖遭流血與痛苦，但美國人不可因中國自封建狀態轉雙至現代工業社會所引起之種種困難，而對之失去關切。對華最有裨益之事，莫如支持各項敎育計劃。司徒雷登大使亦當以此為言。聯總在中國之最大貢獻，厥為訓練工作。福氏對於援華會運守救濟國共兩區一視同仁之原則，表示讚楊，並欽佩宋慶齡女士之熱心慈善事業。</p>
<h3>王外長態度緘默　不發表對新事件意見</h3>

<p>安多藏區甘南草尼四十八族一百寺代表楊司令復興（中立者），來京向蔣主席致敬，並呈獻禮物。（中央社攝）</p>
<h3>美需要我國鎢產　政府存積政策造成缺鎢局面</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐釣十四日電〕據此問鎢業界人士稱：中國為全球主要之鎢礦供應國，故甚易重獲美國之市塲，蓋美國為工業上用鎢最多之國家，同時最近之報道，復堪佐證此說。蓋係美國之工業，已因政府之存積政策及缺乏進口而面臨嚴重缺鎢之局面。美國鎢之缺乏，已造成鎢礦價格之猛漲，在過去六個月中，已自每廿磅單位廿三美元漲至卅二美元（約漲百分之卅），戰前中國緬甸及馬來亞之鎢礦，供應佔全球百分之六十五，此後鎢之生產，乃集中於美國及南美洲國家，如玻利維亞，巴西及墨西哥。蓋中國之鎢出口，已因其努力作戰及運輸不便而大為停滯，最近成本高漲，同時美國鎢業，復採取關稅壁壘制，故中國之鎢業界人士，已感開採鎢礦出口實不能獲利。鎢可抗熱抗酸，故不論於戰時或平時，俱為一重要之金屬，美國在工業上，鎢係用於製造高速度之機器鋼，鎢絲及各權化學品署。在軍事上，鎢係用於製造裝甲板及穿甲彈，故在軍事上為一重要之金屬。記者自權威人士獲悉：美國政府已存積大批鎢礦苗及錫，此項存貨，係留供緊急用途者，目前則置於陸海軍部軍火局管制之下。樣稱：美國政府議續儲積此項重要金屬供今棧五年之用，彼等拒絕以任何存貨供商業用途。據鎢業人士估計：自本年最初三月以來，美國消費鎢約二百五十萬磅，目前美國市塲上司護之錫供應，已不足四丹之用。美國工業之大量應用鎢已使錫之供應與需要間，造成巨大差額，此間鎢業人士認為中國之鎢礦，若能採取新法，並以國際價格出售，則可為獲取美匯之一大資源。</p>
<h3>普選決如期舉行　中共似無意言和　張君勱由京返滬談時局</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕張君勵昨由京返滬，接見記者時稱：「關於憲法之統一解釋，已由指定人員起草中。至於和平方案之確定，則下次國務會議中將通過接受參政會之和平決議。過去三黨共同施政方針中恢復交通之前提，將略而不談，即恢復和談為無條件的，只需中共願談，任何時期均能開始。又本人此次在京時，亦曾接洽參與普選之事，目前各項籌備工作，如人口調查及印製選舉票等均在進行，政府決照國大決議實行，不擬延期。關於民靑兩黨與政府代表人數比例之洽商，亦在談判。如欲各黨共同進行選舉，則應先商定代表之比例」。張氏報吿畢，記者以時局之演變情形詢間，承分別答覆如下：（一）新疆事件，局勢之瞭解尚不够，殆為外蒙與新省間之同題。</p>
<p>共軍內容複雜　東北局勢緊張</p>
<p>（二）東北共軍攻勢中，有韓共及日俘參與，局勢殊為嚴重。共產黨本有國際性，故嚴重不自今日始。（三）關於保障人權事，本人因范樸齊之被捕，曾上書張院長。事實上范並未被拘捕，僅留住在蓉城郊外農塲上，恢復自由僅為時間問題。各地學生及記者被捕者，有一部份學生已加處罰，記者則正由新聞局營救中。此類緊急措施，政府決暫停實行。（四）目前之經濟政策應注重增加生產，然後方能由出口而取得外匯。內戰雖在進行，但大江以南，不受吳災，仍可努力增產，尤以農業為然，例如棉花產量之提高，政府方面頗有自信。張氏</p>
<p>目前和平之獲致尚有困難，因中</p>
<p>强軍事，即使應允其過去要求之兩項前提，亦未必能化干戈為玉帛，整軍方案中之軍隊國家化方案，今日中共亦未必認為滿意。</p>
<p>民社黨定下月　舉行全代大會</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨昨日午後三時，於愚圍路總部召開中常會，決定於七月廿五日舉行該黨全國代表大會，各地代表會計約二百人，由各支部推選產生。</p>

<h3>國防部組織系統　某負責人對記者談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕國防部成立迄今，雖已一年，但在組織系統上，外界仍多不甚瞭解，頃據國防部某負現人士語記者，在組織系統上，國防部隸屬行政院，部長爲政院之一員，亦爲主席之軍事顧問，代表政府掌握軍政廣泛政策，以人，財，物三者之大權，監督政令之實施。參謀總長爲最高統帥之幕僚長，亦爲國防部長行政戰責上之首要顧問，同時亦爲全軍之司令官，代表統帥指揮軍隊，陸海空軍聯勤各總司令為其所屬部隊之司令官，邀照參謀總長之各種計劃而執行其職務。國防部組織之根本原則在權能劃分，部長代表政府掌握其權，參謀總長以下，統稱軍隊，在廣泛軍政方面，受部長之指導，在軍令方面，則直接向元首負資，而發據其能以統一運用陸海空軍，為最進步之新型軍事組織</p>
<h3>「空中霸王」飛機　最近屢次失事　機體構造必有不當之處</h3>

<h3>納粹潛勢力　分布三大洲　中心地在阿根廷</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敎十四日電〕研究歐洲問題之國際委員會本日宣稱：三大洲有鉅大納粹地下組織之存在。按該委員會由英·法·丹麥·比利時及挪威等代表所組成，總部設於倫敦。該委員會秘書長波萊爾博士吿報界稱，納粹活躍份子數千名現分佈於瑞典，阿根廷。南美。德國及義大利各地，全世界納粹地下組織之中心諒在阿根廷。渠並稱，美國並不關心於　淸納粹工作及納粹之復活，僅憂慮蘇聯及共產主義。一九三九年至一九四五年間之第二次大戰旣未消滅納粹亦未消滅法西斯，而共產主義與反共產主義之世界性爭鬥則已吿開始。</p>

<p>總理教訓　朗若日星</p>
<p>總理剏始本校，旨在重造革命基礎，建立具有革命精神之軍隊，掃除革命障碍，完成革命事業，使三民主義完成實現，以挽救中國之危之。其開學日親蒞本校之訓詞，一則曰立革命志氣，效先烈行為；二則曰革侖必先革心，必須將從前不良的思想習慣性質，根本革除，打破自私自利之觀念，一心一意，為國奮鬥；三則曰革命軍應具體高深學問，明白革命道理，乃能視死如歸，發揮以一當百之精神。而最後又鄭重申言之曰：革命事業即為救國救民。總理此一深切著明之敎訓，實為吾黃埔精神所託命，迄於第二十三年紀念之令日，仍朋若日星而歷久不磨。</p>
<p>革命障碍　有待廓淸</p>
<p>溯自平定東江，出師北伐，掃蕩軍閥，統一中國，以迄八年神聖艱苦之抗戰’吾歷屆同學之喋血疆塲，為國犧性者踵趾相接，無慮數萬人，迄今抗戰勝利，已將二年，國基之杌隉，憂息之業積，人民之困苦，幾又回復於民國十三年本校開學之時，而革命環境之險惡，反革命勢力之囂張，主義之味冥否塞，人心之散漫徬徨，視當時乃猶過之。語有之：「道高一尺，魔高一丈。」又曰：「艱難困苦，玉汝於成。」革命將達最後之成功，則革命前途之障碍，有待於吾人之摧陷廓清者，自必益顯其頑强而劇烈。故今之日後，爲吾人最後奮鬥之時機，亦即革命成敗，國家存亡，民族興替之關鍵。吾歷屆畢業之同學，或浴血奮鬥於前綫，或分別致力於建軍建國之工作，臨此重要之紀念日，須知國家之憂患，革命之艱阻，閭里之殘破瘡痍，同胞之顚連痛苦，皆吾人切身最大之恥辱。而黃埔歷史之光輝，能否發揚。抗戰勝利之成果，能否保持？先烈地下之英靈，能否瞑目？又皆爲吾十萬同學人人無可旁貸之責任『</p>
<p>協同一致　自強不息</p>
<p>吾校之校訓曰「親愛精誠」，必有協同一致，榮辱一體之精神，乃可以言親愛；必有自强不息，篤實不欺之品德，乃可以言精誠。吾同學所應奮發黽勉之要旨，余於本校成立廿週年紀念日，已詳言之·今日所欲特別提示於我全體同學者，厥為吾總理最精　之敎訓日：「立革命志氣，效先烈行為」。諾同學必深切自反，吾人日常之思想生活與行動，是否無愧於革命黨人獨立不搖，大公無我，舍生取義，愈挫愈奮之志氣？，吾人之立身處世，作戰與治事，能否效法革命先烈與已死同學不畏困難，不避危險，剛毅果敢，有我無敵之行為？</p>
<p>繼往開來　身體力行</p>
<p>緒業賴吾人而行延續，國族之危亡賴吾人而拯救，本黨之恥辱，恃吾人而　雪，同胞之痛苦，恃吾人而昭蘇。吾人今日之地位，為孤臣棄子，吾人今日之責任為繼往開來，吾人今日如不為最後奮鬥之成功者，即將為有負總理，有負光烈，有負已死同學，有負國家民族，千秋萬世，百死英贖之罪人。時乎不再，有志竟成，如何自勉自救，路先烈之血跡，而披荊斬棘，以向最後成功之目標，諸同學其深思猛省而身體力行之。</p>

<h3>對開放日本貿易　國人應深加警惕　滬各方人士一般意見</h3>
<p>（本市訊）美國國務院宣佈美將於本年八月中開放日本對外貿易棧，此間各界人士，極為重視，茲特微為各方意見集納報道如次據市商會現事長徐寄廎氏稱：自麥帥管制日本後，成績斐然。我國以受時局不安定影響，對復興建設，均受相當阻碍，更以國內原料供應問題未能充分解決，生產事業萎縮，將來日貨源源而來，我國工業前途，當更有莫大危機。徐氏繼稱：本人為甲午後留日學生，居日甚久，日本民族性，知之較稔，槪言之，外謙和而內詭譎，貌恭順而心狡猾。現日本雖戰敗，在麥帥扶植之下，其恢復能力殊可驚人，吾人更應警揚。</p>
<p>據江海關稅務司劉丙彝氏稱：日本戰前貿易數量，非僅稱為遠東巨　，即在世界，亦佔重要地位。考之吾國海關歷年統計表，及世界貿易册，不難明瞭。吾國當前國際貿易不振，入超一時無法减低，已成顯然事實，加此勁敵，前途更不堪設想。日本對外恢復貿易，此時雖覺言之過早，然我國工商界不得不作事先準備。</p>

<h3>日本進出口商　在死亡綫掙扎</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十五日電〕據估計：有數達七千之日本進出口商，刻在死亡綫掙扎中，蓋麥帥所發表關於日本對外貿易恢復之聲明，曾向盟國商人保證，可與日本生產者有無限制之接觸，並供給此等商人在日本之所有使利。日本進出口商咸恐盟國貿易商一日進入日本，彼等勢將奪取日水進出口商之經紀人地位。此等鬱鬱不樂之進出口商，告中央社記者謂：彼等實無機會與曾獲得麥帥諾言可獲有所有可能便利之盟國商人相競爭。另一方面，日本出口商，則面臨運輸工具缺乏之無上困難，以及盟總對外貿易組識之管制。日本出口商指稱：盟國貿易商在享有運輸便利情况下，與日本生產者之接觸，實較日本出口商所為者為易。此外，管制日本貿易之盟總對外貿易組，將對盟國貿易商較為通融，而對日本出口商則置之不顧，日本進出口商品，恐彼等拒任經紀人之時代，或吿結束。</p>

<h3>原料缺乏銷路不振　日絲紗產量銳減　僅達戰前百分之三十</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十五日電〕日本之絲業及人造絲業，將與綿業及漁業同為國家收入之來源，然人造絲業一如棉業，亦遭受阻礙，銷路則因美製尼隆之興，亦吿不振。日本之生絲業，如求恢復世界市場，亦同樣緩慢。日本自去歲十二月迄本年三月止，共向美輸出生絲八萬四千四百包（每包一百卅二磅），然已經售出者僅二萬包。日本人士謂：本年將輸出十三萬包，然迄四月中句止，僅輸出二千餘包。日本目前生絲產量，每月為八千五百包。日本從專養蠶者，據農林省發表，為八十七萬六千五百人，桑田共有十八萬六千二百五十丁，去歲所產蠶種，共為三千二百四十九萬克，蠶獻計達一千八百廿一萬貫（侮貫等於八·二八英磅）。據美國絲業專家稱：在日本經濟中，其他工業，無有足以代替養蠶業者。日本目前所產人造絲及棉紗，僅達戰前之百分之卅，目前人造絲之產量，猶不及一百萬磅，而棉紗每月產量，亦僅二百萬磅弱。</p>

<h3>從經濟復興中求安定</h3>
<p>亞洲曁遠東經濟委員會開慕獻辭</p>
<p>聯合國亞洲曁遠東經濟委員會，今晨在滬隆重開幕，中，美，英，蘇，法，荷，菲，暹，印，澳十國代表，均已聯袂抵滬：聯合國社會經濟委員會副秘書長沃文，特地自美來滬，主持會務。我國當局為重視這次會議起見，亦由王外長親自主持揭幕典禮，並代表蔣主席致辭。這是戰後在遠東召開的第一次國際會議，其任務雖在研究遠束各國因戰時在經濟上所受的損失，以提供建議如何恢複各該國之經濟情形，並建立各國間正常之經濟關係，但其作用，決不限於經濟一方面，在政治上亦必有非常重要的影響。在此政治與經濟分不開的今日，政治的安定，往往有賴於經濟問題的解決；同樣，經濟的穩定，也有賴於政治的開明與進步。所以遠東經濟委員會今晨在滬成立，無論就聯合國機構的遠大理想言，或就遠東經濟復興的前途言，均有莫大的意義。我們對於此委員會的會議，特別戚到無限的興奮與股切的期望，尤其對於遠道來滬的各國代表，首應表示由衷的歡迎。</p>
<p>現代的國際戰爭，實在是人類的浩刧？尤其是第二次世界大戰，所給予人類的痛苦更深。中日戰爭是第二次大戰的序幕，所以亞洲受戰爭的茶毒，不僅歷時較歐洲為久，而且共所受的損失也較歐洲為鉅。杜魯門總統為恢復歐洲各國的經濟情形起見，業已提出了一種經濟援助歐洲各國的計劃，以防歐洲各國社會經濟的陷於崩潰，但是對於亞洲各國的經濟援助計劃，尚未議反：因此，亞洲各國的人民，對於遠東經濟委員會成立的期望，自更感迫切。就中國而論，自七七事變發生，以迄抗戰勝利結束，公私物資所受的損失，約計當不下三百萬萬美元，軍民的死傷以及國家軍費的支出，尚不計算在內。何况我國在創鉅痛深之餘，正欲從事於戰後經濟復興工作，則今後不論在物資上經濟上，其需要外來的協助，無待煩言。要求日本優先賠償，固然不失為一種辦法，而且我國駐日代表團也曾率直表示過，「中國希望能自日本現行生產中提取賠償，中國需要自日本獲得立卽可以應用的物資」，但是日本的賠償能力終屬有限，未必能賠償我國全部損失，而且這個日本賠償問題，各國的意見紛歧，迄未觸及問題的核心，預料對日和會又遙遙無期，中國在這種情况之下，旣不能立卽自日本取得賠償，自然唯有希望聯合國社會經濟委員會能採取一種有效的措置，使中國的社會經濟不致陷於崩潰的困境。目前中國社會經濟的險象環生，危機四伏，一方面固然可以說由於內在的原因所致，但在另一方面，究竟不能不說是由於八年抗戰的結果。共產黨破壞勢力的不能消滅，反而有變成流寇的趨勢，其根本的原因，也由於中國的社會經濟受了長斯抗戰的影響，造成有利於破壤之徒從事煽動的環境。</p>
<p>中國的賓際情形固然如此，就是在亞洲其他各國，也有同樣可悲的景象。先言印度，英國雖已提供諾言，提早將政權移交印度，使印度產生出一個美麗的遠景，但在社會經濟方面，由於印回的內爭，各地發生紛擾，今且方興未艾，將來印回分治後，可怕的內爭，或將愈演愈烈，而其最終的結果，亦足使印度的社會經濟陷於破產的邊緣。聯合國若不能正視現實，防患未然，早些予以一切　能的協助，使其恢複正常狀態，則印度經濟的前途，也是未可完全樂觀的。其次是印度尼西亞，在大戰結束之後，受了世界潮流的激盪，乃揭起民族解放的大旗，向荷蘭索取獨立與自由；結果，又引起一幕流血的慘劇，一直到今天，尚未能獲得澈底的解決，環顧國內的情形，不僅家破人亡，田園荒蕪，而且向以富庶見稱於世的束印度羣島，今日不論在社會方面或在經濟方面，也都潛伏着稱種危機。再次是關於越南的情形，她和印度尼西亞的實際情形，完全相同。此外緬甸·暹羅·菲律濱等，均在大戰期間，受盡日本帝國主義的摧殘，元氣喪失，亦迄未能恢復舊觀。</p>
<p>戰後亞洲各國人民的愁眉苦臉，僅看了上面幾句的淸描淡寫，也當可以有一個簡單的輪廓了。我們固不顧在十國代表之前，危言聳聽，强調亞洲各國社會經濟的危機，但竭誠希望遠東經濟委員會，能就地查明亞洲各國的實際情形，俾能對症下藥，提供切實有效的建議，如何使亞洲各國均能迅速達於經濟復興之境，庶不致再引起戰後必然發生的經濟恐慌。至於在積極方面，如何增加亞洲各國的生產，如何提高亞洲人民的生活水準，如何促進亞洲各國間之經濟合作，都要由這次經濟委員會討論出一種具體有效的方案。</p>
<p>要之，遠東經濟委員會的成立，官有非常重大的意義，惟其任務限於提供建議，建議的執行與否，其權握於各國的自身，而今日亞洲各國所迫切需要的，不是空空洞洞的計劃，而是物質的援助及技術的合作。在聯合國機構的本身，雖然也能盡其最大的努力，但是我們終希望美國之經濟援助計劃能够擴大。目下美國正在設法進行經濟援助歐洲各國，我們希望美國能放大眼光，絕不忽視亞洲各國的重要性，立卽將其經濟援助計劃推行及於亞洲各國。所以聯合國機　如何配合美國的經濟援助歐亞兩洲的計劃，使戰後的亞洲能在復興中謀安定，使戰後約亞洲能在安定中求繁榮，實為遠東經濟委員會當前唯一的課題。</p>

<h3>杜魯門總統簽署　四國和約批准書　強調美義兩大民族友誼　指責羅匈保迄未能成立民主政府</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電）杜警門總統今日簽署義羅匈保四國和約之批准需，當時曾發表聲明。其關於義大利和釣之聲明有謂：「該釣之若干款，並不與吾人之意志完全相符，今後可能視需要情形，經由聯合國機構予以更改。對義和約之批准，使義美關係中不愉快的一章已儒之結束，同時義大利已進入新時代，使其人民得以期望而信任的心情向前瞻望。義大利軍民在戰敗法西斯及納粹之任務中，頗有貢獻。美義兩大民族之共同犧牲已加强雙方之友誼。值此義大利人民在逆境之下軍建其民主恢復其自由之際，美國得站於義大利之一邊深感愉快。美國人民決繼續援助義人」。</p>
<p>其關於羅匈保和約之聲明有謂：「本人以爲必須對此三國政府之不顧大多數民意並從事壓制民意，公開表示遺憾。自此三國獲得解放，並同三強成立雅爾達協議以來，余即希望眞正代表人民之政府得在該三國成立，但時至今日，此等政府猶未存在，然爲羅匈保三國人民之利益計，美國與此三國間存續已逾五年之戰爭狀態，必須使其結束。和平之建立，意即各國佔領軍隊（除維持對奧交通綫之蘇聯軍隊外），均將自各該國撤退，而根據停戰協定所設之管制委員會，亦將結束。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕杜魯門總統十四日在簽署義羅匈保四國和約時，指斥羅匈保三國政府違反其本國之民意。同時贊譽義大利人民並希望其成為「强盛·自由及民主之義大利。」杜魯門嚴詞斥責巴爾幹三國政府之時，正在美國官員籌劃制止蘇聯之東歐政治侵略之方法以後。美官員已改變立即向聯合國陳訴匈牙利政變之初衷，蓋若蘇聯決意加以阻止，則聯合國及美國事實上對蘇聯在匈牙利之行動即不能有所作為。美國官員現感覺最妥當之辦法，厥為先使和約生效，然後再觀望匈牙利及其他各地之變化。據權威方面消息：美國尚未擬定將來在巴議幹採取何種行動之計劃。同時預料蘇聯將拒絕美國要求三強調查匈牙利之建議。</p>
<h3>義和約生效後九十日內　英駐軍全部撤退　兩國在羅馬簽訂協定</h3>
<p>〔路透社羅馬十四日電〕英義兩國頃各以主權之地位，在議外交部簽訂協定，以便利英軍之撤退，並確定　義和約生效後九十日內英軍在義之地位。該協定乃函件四通，包括十四點，內客將由英政府以白皮書之方式發表，故目前猶不能公布。但悉其中之規定，將不外：英軍假道義境開至威尼齊亞士利亞省，英軍繼續使用義大利之空屋，但英軍當在九十日內從事　速撤退。英軍人員受英國法庭之管轄，義當局供給英軍費用等。此一協定內容已知將美當局預料美義之間亦將成立類似之協定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社羅馬十四日電〕據英大使館發言人稱，現駐義英軍僅約三萬五千人，對德作戰時最多曾達五十萬，英大使却爾斯代表英政府簽訂協定後稱，英軍一旦完全撤退，停戰時期之最後徽象即行消滅。義外長史福薩亦於簽字後宣稱，此協定可象繳英義諒解之未來關係。</p>
<h3>義大利普選　決定明春舉行</h3>

<h3>教廷機關報　謂衝突可避免</h3>
<p>〔聯合沘梵蒂岡敎廷十四日電〕敎廷機關「羅馬觀察報」今日社論稱：共產主義與西方民主之衝突，並非不可避免，世界上儘有容納一種以上生活方式之餘地。尤要者，國家理論必須認識一切理想可以並存於世。彼等必須認識此點，否則又將重提「你死我活」矣。</p>
<h3>英首相演說　擁護聯合國機構　世人應瞭解其重要性</h3>
<p>〔路透社英國坎特培里附近吉爾漢別墅十四日電〕艾德禮苜相今日在支持「聯合國機構協會」之會議中致辭，表示任何未來的戰爭，不僅為個人生與死的事件，乃整個文化生與死的事件。首相請，「若干人士以為世界可循其舊途繼續前進，一旦發生危機，即可由聯合國機構防止慘劇之發生，本人不信此乃吾人得以完成建立聯合國機構之途徑。吾人欲使世人認淸此一聯合國機構，其重要正不亞於彼等本國之政府，故人人必須運用其理智，以了解聯合國機構所處理之問題」。</p>

<h3>美共和黨要求　更大發言權</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十四日電〕國務卿馬墨爾本日面臨一項問題，即共和黨要求在審劃美國外交政策方面有更大之發言權，尤是其籌劃數十億美元之復興歐洲計劃，參院議長范登堡要求迅速組職兩黨特別顧問委員會。國會中對此事意見頗不一致，若干共和黨參議員表示彼等對於美國在國外再費用款項之事表示懷疑，共和黨政策委員會主席塔虎脫頃談稱：關於在對外援助計劃，渠將發表聲明，並將於廿三日召集兩院經濟委員會舉行特別會議，討論有關國外用款之一切事宜。馬歇爾及其僚屬對　堡之計劃尚無反應，但即使　等有反對之意，亦知頗為難於應付，蓋范登堡乃策劃美國外交政策之中堅份十，尤其是策劃「必需由國會採取行動」之任何事　　且復興歐洲經濟計劃不但置國會之批准，並需撥付數十億美元如果范登堡要求組織兩黨顧問委員會之「代價」即儒對於復興歐洲計劃之合作，馬歇爾諒必加以贊助云。</p>

<p>〔合衆社倫敦十四日電〕據巴黎電訊：多瑙河國家在蘇聯策動下，將在羅京召集會議，奧地利亦在被邀之列，企圖誘其加入正在醞釀中之巴爾幹集團。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社維也納十四日電〕奧外長格魯勃今晚發表廣播演說，猛烈抨擊共黨，企圖使奧國受少數派之統治，並謂奧國已為世界良心之神經中樞。企圖將奧國置於少數派統治之下，亦即企圖破壞國際合作之制度。世界和平要求吾人粉碎一切實行獨裁之企圖，吾人必須勿為武力所屈服。奧共黨領袖費旭曾留學蘇聯多年，要求與蘇保持密切關係，殊無理由可言，要之自由奧國即將誕生，較吾人所預料者為早云。</p>
<h3>英聯幫協會主張　召開三巨頭會議　解決原子能管制問題</h3>

<p>英法加緊會商　美國援歐計劃</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十四日電〕法國外交部經濟司司長亞爾方德，將於下星期初前來倫敦，與英國經濟專家商討馬歇爾國務卿所提出之援助歐洲計劃。同時英國外相貝文亦將前往巴黎，與法國外長皮杜爾會晤，於是貝文外相所宣佈之英法兩國經濟合作，即將進入積極階段。英國與法國對於美國在經濟上援助歐洲之計劃，在一星期前早已開始會商，而今則雙方將共同審議最佳之方法，以適應美國之援歐計劃。馬歇爾國務卿應更詳細說明其援助計劃，然後歐洲各國始能以此為基礎，對於其需要擬定聯合聲明。惟現所當解決之問題，厥為應否依類已在日內瓦成立之各種歐洲經濟與社會機構，與美國接觸，抑或由歐洲有關各國直接與美談判。此外美國援助歐洲之計劃，應否為以三四年為限之普遍援助計劃，抑或為較易實能而僅供應迫切需要之計劃，在此二者之間，亦必須有所抉擇。</p>

<h3>日吏治窳敗　片山擬分期改革</h3>

<h3>蔣夫人飛返京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕蔣夫人宋美齡女士比次由京來滬醫治牙疾後，已於昨午十二時十五分偕侍衛官張永良及秘書陳伊璇等，乘「美齡」號專機返京。吳市長夫婦及宋子文氏等均前往機塲歡迎。</p>
<h3>積極稽微所利得稅　查帳標準儘量提高　滬應查帳單位僅百分之三</h3>
<p>財政部為執行經濟緊急措施方案整頓稅收之原則，積極稽征去年度所利得稅，並擇要舉行査張。惟上海方面商會認爲手續繁重，請求財部免除查帳，仍採簡化稽征辦法。茲由財政部發言人稱，根據營利事業所得稅稽征辦法之規定，上海市屬於査帳核稅區域，上海直接稅局積極進行査帳工作，係奉令辦理，並合於計算公平之原則。</p>
<p>近爲顧及事實便利商民起見，已將査帳標準儘量提高，除各業申報其全年營業總額在四億元以上，或收益額在二億元以上者，仍行査帳外，其餘則一律按標準計稅辦法辦理。所謂標準計稅，係根據申報所得額分別抽査各該行業帳據，比較完備確實之商號百分之五至百分之十，在每一業中又視營業額多寡，用抽籤方式抽査，再就抽査結果，計算標準比率，然後分戶核定稅額。依照此項標準，上海市五萬餘工商事業中，應行査帳者，照銷貨額計算者，約一千六百餘單位，以收益額由報之金融業有四十餘單位，總計應査帳單位，僅爲上海全市百分之三弱，其中包括外商多家在內，如此辦理，則公平與簡便兼能顧及。本部業已訓令上海直接稅局妥連遵辦，嚴防苛擾，庶國利民福兩能兼顧云。該發言人並稱：過去一度試行之簡化稽征之辦法，係由各業同業公會認定數額，就同業中分攤，實際等於攤派，與所得稅基本制度不合，實不宜採行。財部今後將不斷致力於優良合理之稅制基礎之建立，所望全國之商民，切實合作，共觀厥成。又上海外商美孚行等除早已申報上年所得額，並繳納所得稅外，近且自行估計本年一至四月份盈餘數額，預繳鉅額所得稅云。</p>

<h3>極預防傳染病　可請噴射DDT</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據防疫委員會發言人稱，天花。腦膜炎等春季疫病，至今已漸趨减少。霍亂等夏季傳染病則尙未發現，目前正積極推進預防工作。迄今全市注射防疫針者已有五十六萬人，DDT噴射，則行總所撥純粉約十二噸，含量百分之十者約有卅噸，但因煤油購買困難，存粉不多，故噴射消毒工作分爲三類：（一）棚戶。貧民區。公厠等處由防疫會負責免費噴射。（二）機關學校團體如需嚐射，防疫會可免費供給DDT粉，並予協助指導，但煤油須自備，每加侖可噴射一千平方尺。（三）旅館·飲食店·大工廠等如需噴射，可與防疫會接洽，收回成本費用。</p>

<h3>錢劍秋博士播講　勝利後上海婦女運動　應當養成堅強意志發揮力量</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報於昨日假座民聲電台，舉行第十一次星期日特別廣播，請錢劍秋博士（見圖。本報攝）播講，題爲「勝利後上海市的婦女運動」。茲紀其演詞如下：</p>
<p>團結一致共謀福利</p>
<p>「婦女運動的歷史很悠久，範圍也很廣泛，今天所講的範國，限於勝利後一年又十個月，材料限於上海市區。婦女運動這名詞的意義，是婦女大衆團結一致，羣策羣力，共謀婦女本身的福利。我們要推進婦運，首要組織嚴密，纔可發生力量。上海各階層的婦女，可分作（一）職業婦女，（二）家庭主婦，（三）勞動婦女，（四）求學的女靑年。勝利後我們對於上海市婦女，集體的組織起來，成立了十一個聯誼會，如敎育界，文藝界，體育界，家庭主婦，以及正在求學的大中學生等。每一個單位謀取共同的利益。至於福利方面，也成立了上海市婦女福利協會，辦理救濟慈幼及其他福利事項。以上各單位的組織，在上海市婦女運動委員會指導之下，推進工作，這是婦運的輪廓。以下我要提出一些實際情形的報吿：</p>
<p>大中女生注重訓練</p>
<p>（一）大中學女生——大中學女生都是智識份子，對思想及品格方面，都須有完善的訓練，曾先後舉行演說，論文，體育競賽，在一年又十個月之中，我們會盡最大努力。因爲演說可以訓練講話的技能，論文可以增進寫作的技能，而體育可以鍜鍊她們的體格，所以對這三項競賽，是非常注重的。</p>
<p>職業婦女尚待努力</p>
<p>（二）職業婦女——上海的職業婦女數字相當多，其中最多的首推敎育界，其次是自由職業，以及從政的，經商的。自由職業部份，以醫師最多，律師次之，會計師較少。從政的婦女，我覺得徒具虛名，而能負起實際責任的實在太少。以上海而言，薦任以上的已如鳳毛麟角，現在名義上是男女平權，而在政治上能自由發展的　　是難乎其難。至於服務商界，能　　頭地的也少得可憐，上海是全國　　業的中心，婦女在商界尙不能露頭角，其他各地更可想見了。還有一點可喜的現象，是勝利後女記者相當活躍，服務效率，不在男子之下，可是人數還有限，希望我女界同志，在職業界多方面，努力擴大服務的效能，爲女界爭光。</p>
<p>家庭婦女不乏天才</p>
<p>（三）家庭婦女——上海婦女最多數的還是家庭主婦，有一部份人只是消費　不事生產，她們有很多曾受高深的敎育，也具有很好的天才，而不能向上發展其抱負，眞使人覺得非常的惋惜，在淪陷時期，大家感到環境特殊，乃至勝利以後，一般主婦，思想上大有進步，以爲在國家建設的過程中，再也不能醉生夢死，想做些有利於國家社會的事業，譬如子女長大了，正可以分一部份時間與精力貢獻到社會事業上來，這是一種警覺，自力更生的良好現象。同時她們對於慈幼救濟，如托兒所的捐款，出錢出力，十分熟心，値得大家敬佩。</p>
<p>改善勞動婦女生活</p>
<p>（四）勞動婦女——提起勞動婦女，在上海人數相當多，她們對於社會生產事業盡了很大的力量，但生活艱苦，我們表示極大的同情，應該儘可能對她們的福利事業多多提倡。換言之，她們旣是社會的生產者，我們匯對她們的福利事業格外提倡，使其精神上得安慰，物質上也得到享受。過去我們　有識字班，給予受敎育的機會，辦理托兒所，使其兒女得到合理的撫養。</p>
<p>一般婦女應矯惡習</p>
<p>（五）一般婦女——上海還有一般婦女生活奢侈，習尙虛榮，行動也不合正軌。我們引爲憾事，當負起責任來糾正她們，第一，奢侈坐活應改革；第二，虛榮心理應改變；第三要建立經濟自立的基礎，使她們養成簡單樸實勤勞耐苦的精神。我們要展開婦女運動。應當使婦女養成堅强的意志，不隨波逐流，不爲亞劣環境所同化。發揮婦女界的力量，以展開婦女運動的光明的前金。」</p>
<p>全日廣播節目</p>
<p>昨爲本報舉辦第十一次特別廣播，自上午九時開始，有趙君影牧師主講「科學與宗敎，」鍾志和醫師主講「人工氣胸結論，」劉大音主講「美金公債淺說。」下午一時有本報主辦之廣播兒童音樂會，參加學校有五區一·二中心·西成·通惠各單位，由徐希一·潘伯英·金世榮贊助領導，並由徐潘兩氏親自指揮。各項表演成績非常優美。一一時十分起特耽包寒英小妣主講「兒童故事，」宓錫通律師主講「遺產稅，」黄嘉音主講「選譯配偶的標準，」及錢劍秋博士主講」利後上海的婦女運動。」七時後出仙霓社全體社員播唱崑曲及票界名宿羅亮生·王準臣。張省厂·女名票王　衛小姐·唐太太等播唱平劇，直至十時始吿畢事。</p>
<h3>國產影片界鳥瞰　全滬共有五家規模較大攝製廠商　戰區的存在限制了多處放映機會</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕看電影，是大多數市民所愛好的娛樂。在這被好萊塢影片佔着壓倒聲勢的都市裏，我們且來烏瞰一香瑟縮在一隅的國產電影界的槪况。</p>
<p>首先從攝製廠商說起。全上海—也可以說全中國—規模較大，具有固定組織和基礎的攝影塲或製片廠有：（一）中央電影攝影塲，，（二）國泰影片公司，（三）前聯華影片公司之舊部，（四）上海實騐電影工塲，（五）文華影片公司等五家。中電是半官性質的機構，塲長羅學濂，下面分爲三廠，一廠在閘北天通庵，廠長裘一葦，二廠在建國西路，廠長除蘇　，三廠遠在北平，廠長徐昂千。國泰是一個純粹商業化的製片公司，老閣柳中浩，手下擁有雄厚的資金與大批人馬，出品最多最快，但不免流於濫，製片的大本營在大木橋，聯華舊部的組織比較複雜，其名稱有上海影樓社，昆崙影業公司等，與上海實騐電影工場，同為比較嚴肅的藝人所主持，前者的負責人是蔡楚生，鄭君里，貺東山等，後者則是費穆。文華規劃較小，經理是吳性裁。上述這三家製片的地點都集中在徐家匯三角地。除此之外，也許有少數在電影圈子裏「攪攪」的朋友，俱然興起，或者福至心靈。認爲有錢可　，於是集合這麽一批資本，請幾位「吃香」明星，借別人家的影棚或者甚至於遠至香港、拍上一都兩部片子，隨便起一個某某製片公司的名義來放映。這一類的「遊擊式」製片商，並無固定組織和固定基礎，這裏也不用說了。</p>
<p>明星酬報女　重於男</p>
<p>據圈子裏的朋友估計，國泰過去出品的速度是平均每月一部，但現在已有漸慢的趨勢。中電與文華平均每二月一部，聯華舊部與實騐工塲場則一年僅有一部。出品的快慢，一方面固然由於資本與規模的大小，另一方，製片態度是組濫或認眞，亦爲主要的原因。</p>
<p>一部影片的攝製，最主要的是導演和演員。自從勝利以來，上海社會各方面無形中分成「內地來的」與「收復區的」兩個畛域，電影界也不能例外。「從內地來的」導演和演員大都集中在中電，如張駿祥，陳鯉庭，趙丹，白白楊，秦怡等等，「在收復區的」則由國泰等所包容，如楊小仲，徐欣夫，李萍倩，陳燕燕，劉瓊，顧蘭君，李麗華，嚴俊等，另有一批則是從話劇界轉過來的如佐臨，石揮，張伐等等。不過就演員而論，大多數並非固定屬於某一個公司或是某一個影場，而是所謂「明星特約制度」，其酬報論片計値，現時每拍一部片的薪酬自一千萬元至四千萬元不等，視其「紅的程度」而定，並且男女有別，「重女輕男」女明星的收入總比男明星來得多。</p>
<p>一部影片成本五億</p>
<p>在物價不斷上漲的社會經濟環境下，影片業的狀况亦與一般工業界大同小異。佔計現在每一部影片的攝製成本，約在國幣五億元左右，從攝製完成到放映收入，僅管在表面上似乎　錢，但是以再生產成本計算起來，賺錢可就變了蝕本。因此之故，若干廠商製片就求其快，以使資金流通迅速，但這樣就不免流於組製濫造之譏了。此外，戰區的存在，限制了影片多處放映的機會，對於製片者的收入亦是一個重大的打擊。</p>
<p>最成功的一張片子</p>
<p>在設備及技術方面，國產電影較之好萊塢電影固然遠遠不及，但最爲可悲的還在於大多數影劇題材的貧乏。有人說過：如以電影擬之於人，劇本如骨骼，導演如靈魂，演員如血肉，沒有好的劇本，導演無從施展，演員無從表演，而現在國會電影界最缺少的就是好的編劇人才。其次好的演員亦太少，在明星制度之下，一個演員往往同時替兩家以上的廠商拍片，對於時間與精力都是一種損失。至於導演人才，倒還不嫌缺乏，其中且有幾個第一流的好手，假使能給他們配合優良的劇本設備與人才，亦來始不能創造出一番輝煌的成績出來。</p>
<p>最後値得一提的是勝利以來國片中最爲成功的，意思是說擁有最多觀衆的一部影片却是中電三廠出品，屠光啓導演，歐陽莎菲主演的「天字第一號」，據說這部片子不單在頭輪戲院裏賣座甚盛，即在二三輪戲院中也是歷久而不衰。</p>
<p>假使配合優良劇本設備　未始不能創造輝煌成績</p>
<p>社會服務</p>

<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕自政府調整公敎人員待遇後，所有國立各院校五月份起之調整加成經費，即應撥發。京滬區以密邇首都，已分別照加成數發訖。遠道各地，因公文局轉，支付命令稽遲到達，致各院校敎職員感受影響，不能按時領取五月份加成薪津。數日前，北平各院校會爲此事開會，決議電請有關各當局，從速撥發五月份加成各項經費。聞敎部對此，早已注意，曾於五月中旬呈請行政院、對各院校五月份調整所加經費之支付命令，早日轉知財部國庫署，迅令中央銀行國庫局，分別轉知各地分行國庫照發是項經費，同時並函財部國庫署賜予迅辦。最近國庫署已函復敎部，大致謂對於五六兩月份調整加成之數，已一併轉行國庫局，分別轉知各地央行國庫照發，並於七月份至十二月份之加成經費，擬亦發交各地國庫，以便按期支付。據悉：各院校五月份加成經費，已可向當地國庫照領，六月份亦可按時支取。以後七月份起，國庫方面可按期發放。</p>

<h3>鄒秉文允任主委後　紡調會開始籌備　吳味經仍請辭兼處長職</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部紡織事業調節委員會，自奉准設立以來，以內部人事，尙在部署中，故籌備工作，迄未進行。茲悉：主委由鄒秉文出任，大致已無一問題。故該會籌備工作，即日起進行，聞將覓具適當會址，延攬工作人員，一俟部署就緒，可在本週內正式宣告成立。聞該會成立後，將接辦紡管會所經辦之紗布南遝北運及轉口各項業務。惟屆時將斟酌目前情勢，對各項紗布外運管制辦法，加以修正。以應事實需要。</p>
<p>又該會業務處處長一職，本發表係由吳味經氏兼任。茲吳氏以原任中紡建公司副總經理之職，業務已屬繁忙，且以紡建人員，出任此超然之職務，尤感不便。故昨日又親料鄒秉文氏寓邸，堅決憲辭。聞鄒氏仍喂請吳氏打銷辭意，任勞任怨，共　會務進行云。</p>
<h3>三十五年份　中國銀行營業槪況</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國銀行於十四日舉行第二十三屆通常股東總會，經過詳情，業誌昨日本報。茲復探誌該行民國三十五年份營業槪况如次：</p>
<p>一·存款</p>
<p>本年底國內外行處各種存款總額爲四千三百五十五億餘元，較上年度增加三千八百四十三億餘元，國內存款約占百分之五十四，國外約占百分之四十六。國內存戶，工鑛業佔百分之四十一，機關占百分之三十五，個人僅占百分之十一，團體商號等合占百分之十三。</p>
<p>二·放款</p>
<p>本年底放款餘額爲二千七百八十七億餘元，較上年增加二千六百三十五億餘元，以國際貿易放款占第一位，約合百分之四十三，工　事業占百分之二十九，運銷事業占百分之十八，其餘百分之十，分配於交通公用等事業。政府交辦之僑胞復業貸款，因當地法令限制，尙在逐漸進展中。至奉令對外擔保者爲：（一）永利化學公司採購器材借款美金一千六百萬元，（二）美棉貸款美金三千三百萬元。</p>
<p>三·匯兌</p>
<p>甲·內匯：本年度國內匯款總額一萬九千一百二十九億餘元，較上年度增加一萬穴千三百六十二億元，以工商匯款爲最多。</p>
<p>乙·外匯：三十四年底國外部隨總管理處遷滬，外匯業務亦開始發展。本年三月四日，外匯市塲開放，匯率調整，本行對於出口事業，一面簡化結匯手續，一面用打包押匯方式貸款，週轉促進國產外銷。對於外貨進口，只能選擇必需物品，供給外匯。次要貨物，則不得不稍加緊縮，以節漏巵。一年來國外部經收出口外匯共合美金約三千三百餘萬元，經付進口外匯共合美金約八千萬元。此項進出口外匯數字，自不合吾人之理想，但亦非本行獨力所能轉移。至國外部及分支行，共收付進出口外匯達美金一億二千萬元，在全國對外貿易總値中，已占想當成分。</p>
<p>華僑匯款，在一二月份匯率尙未調整解付，仍按加給補助金辦法辦理，業務旺盛。自三月四日起，補助金辦法取銷，所有僑匯，均按國行掛牌行市折合解付。嗣後黑市匯牽漸高，本行經收數額日益减少。截至年底止，計共經收合國幣六百一十餘億元，較上年多收約六百億元。</p>
<p>四·投次，</p>
<p>在過去本行以促進後方生產，增强抗戰實力，爲投資各事業之目標。復員以來，建設尙待開始，投資需要，更覺迫切。本年度內經四聯總處核准，由本行參與者，續有增加，其對象多爲生產運銷機構。</p>
<p>五·分支機構動態</p>
<p>各地分支機構，視事實需要，曾經增减。至年底止，共有機構，二百二十二處，在國內者二百零五處，國外者十七處，其中復業者國內有靑島，鄭州，長春等五十八處。國外有仰光，海防等五處。增設者國內有塘沽，撫順等十六處。國外有西貢一處。裁撤者國內有零陵，獨山等二十六處。國外有河內一處。</p>
<h3>烟市明堅暗軟</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，晨開市績挺秀。塲中門菲帮添辦零胃尙佳，喊價步見上升。十支大英烟一度曾哄高至六百三十萬元，市盤一高，拋售頻起，交易漸淸，價同低十一二萬。午市零星胃口動辦，是以十英烟回上至六百二十二萬元，結果比上日微升七萬元。老刀烟及五華哈德門三牌亦漲自五萬至十萬元“全日烟市情勢，因今（十六日）入霉令期間，又爲廠家派貨絡繹，同業以端節日近，銀根　緊，團戶心慌，逢高出籠，故其脚地一時難轉堅硬。昨惟老刀牌做開甚爲熱鬧，價哄至五百二十六萬元有成交。華成公司之金　牌烟，雖值星期，市亦特俏。　　高至一萬八千二百元難以買進，最後八千五百元有交易，比　日軋升七百元。其餘華回好。</p>
<p>聽裝香烟，昨因走化較活，價回上五百至二千五六百元，又以　令變質較好、市得堅穩。但近由香港方面來貨甚多，兜售於市，同業間胃口已飽，互做極少，故其脚地亦難穩站。</p>

<p>通惠實業銀行董事長鄧華民，日前由渝赴京，出席參政會，會後在京與有關各方，商討四川難設問題。茲悉鄧民已於昨日公畢來滬，記者特往訪晤，並詢是否願出任四川省銀行總經理職務。鄧氏答稱：外傳消息絕對不確。繼謂川中近一月來，物價均極昇騰，尤以食米爲甚。因京滬漢各地搜購，大量東運，兼之產地報漲，成本增高，握有存貨者，旣不願出售，市塲求冬供少，故糧價上漲，每石已高達十七八萬元。疋頭棉紗，反有倒流之勢。至於市塲，則現鈔異常缺乏，乃至商業普通需款，百萬或小額收付，亦難以取得現金，此一情態，極可注意云云。</p>
<h3>冰蛋輸英困難解決　國行擬就補救辦法</h3>
<p>輪廣會對我國冰蛋輸英，前以價格一項，尙未談妥，致尙有四千五百噸未交貨，因英國每噸四八〇元，我國冰蛋折合美金每噸約六〇〇元，經一再磋商後，中央銀行業務局擬就補救辦法，以利輸出。英國方面，仍擬向我國訂購者，有二點原因（一）由華輸入，可以易貨方式，而節省該國外匯。（二）我國戰前輸英冰蛋，已佔該項物品出口額中百分之九十，故爲維持今後貿易計，允酌加買價，預計九月底前，可踐約交貨云。</p>
<h3>棉花續有到貨</h3>
<p>棉花市况，因到貨不斷，兼之外棉報跌，人心軟弱，客戶出意甚濃，紗廠進胃不多，市上銀根已鬆，市况仍不脫疲境。各檔做開，比上日略减，成交不旺。午後黨寳花做開七五件，價一五〇萬。沙市大光一〇〇件，價一四六萬。以上均爲現款棧交價，又沙市花做開一一一件，價一百四十三萬五千元，棧交，七天期支票解款。漢口木架一百件，價一一六萬，送廠，解款以十天期支票。</p>
<h3>木材到貨淤塞</h3>
<p>木材以市塲銀根極緊，又以最近木工漲價，影響實銷。昨市全部下瀉，做開甚少。杭木較月初跌三分之一，每兩由八十五萬直瀉至五十萬元，尙無受主。洋松跌至每尺六千五百元，五分松板鋸方每丈自十五萬跌至十二萬元，杉木大條每尺二千二百元，小條二千一百元，較最高峯時跌一千元。日來各地雨量充分，木材順流而下，故到貨已呈淤寒狀態</p>
<h3>各省菸葉貸欵　分類貸額核定　共二七九億餘</h3>
<p>本年度各省菸葉貸款，業經四聯總處核定爲二百七十九億三千五百萬元。並經中國農民銀行總處擬具該項貸款分類貸額表（單位百萬元）如下：四川省菸葉生產三〇〇，加工，二六〇，貴州省菸葉生產三〇〇，加工二六〇，安徽省菸葉生產二四〇〇，加工一八四五，河南省菸葉生產一一二〇〇〇，加工九六一〇，中東省菸葉生產六〇〇，加工四六〇。</p>
<h3>各業上半年度　情況尚稱良好</h3>
<p>六底比期轉瞬即屆各業均準備上半年度結算。連日本市銀根外弛內緊，惟四行二局曁銀錢業聯合準備庫，均有大批款項放出，各業資金得以週轉，故六底難）關，準可安渡。至今年上半年度，據聞各業均尙能獲利，尤以紗布工業原料搪磁烟草等業爲最，情况均甚良好。百貨藥品等各業，在貨價升値上雖獲利頗鉅，但因開支浩大，實際難以支持。至銀樓金號錢兌業等三業，由於當局取締投機，已陷入僵局。</p>
<h3>中信在蘇浙皖　大量收購菜籽</h3>
<p>產地菜籽登塲，現已値尾聲。中央信託局爲謀食油產量增加，早經擬具收購計劃，委託第三區植物油煉製公會合作代辦。各派幹員分赴江浙皖重要產地，大宗採購。所經指定人員業於週前紛紛出發，工作積極展開。至所需蔴袋已於前日由該局裝出，計蕪湖方面五十捆二萬只；平湖蘇州方面卅捆，計一萬二千只。一俟新貨運到，即可按照旣定方針，就各廠現有設備及生產量予以合理分配。據悉中植可得全數三分之一，餘屬大有裕，大德新，大昌，順餘，惠民，同生等八家。按目前抵滬新貨，每一百公斤市價約値十六萬元至十八萬元，產地以習慣關係，蕪湖每斛計重一三八至一四〇公斤，平湖蘇州每一斛計重一二六至一二八公斤，普通售價每斛計廿一萬元左右，蕪湖運費因輪船價格業經調整，較前增百分之七十，至平湖蘇州，則可由帆船裝載云。</p>
<h3>成本加高運輸不便　川省夏布銷路大減</h3>
<p>〔中央社成都十五日電〕川省特產夏布，以榮昌隆昌出品最精，榮昌隆昌內江之白麻，纖維柔輕，色澤潔白美觀，品質尤佳，爲細夏布之唯一原料。故該數縣爲製造夏布之中心。其製布程序，約分三步驟。一為績麻，將麻之織維績爲麻綫。二為織布，將麻線紡製成生布。三爲精製，將生布加以漂白染色印花漿紮。隆昌內江長於紡織，產布特多。內江者品質最佳，所織多爲細布，且全係雙絲織成。榮昌則長於精製，以該地水質特佳，所漂之布，潔白美麗，故漂染印漿等作房，多設於此。夏布之種類，以經緯綫絞織之不同，故有平布與羅紋之別，平布依其用途而有衣料帳料袋料之分，每匹長約五丈，寬約一尺四寸。其品質之高低，視其頭分多寡而定。頭分者全匹經緯根數之謂也，頭分在五百以下者，稱爲粗布。五百至一千者爲中莊布。一千以上者則爲細布。最上者可至一千六百頭分。川中夏布，運銷全國及朝鮮香俗港等地。有北京帮及及山東山西河南廣東帮等，產量最高時，年達六十餘萬匹。惟以家庭副業之小手工業，經營工作遲緩，每人每日工作二三小時，得布僅一二丈。加以近年物價激漲，運輸不便，銷路大减，致生產萎頓，輸出平均約二三十萬匹，今每匹價十萬元</p>
<h3>工業油脂的來源</h3>
<p>— 章柏庵</p>
<p>油脂土業，在中國還是用陳舊的生產方法生產，夫部油脂均係由產區各個小單位之榨製，其生產之散漫。與夫交易之無規律，迄今尙無改進之可能</p>
<p>「植物汕」與「動物脂」，人多藐視之，而不知其利用價値之大，以及與每個人才關係，迺者，科學昌明，任何物質，咸有驚人之功用，如「甘油」一物，採自油脂工業其用途之大，直可使國防上發生甚大的影響，如果沒有「三硝　丙之醇」，則槍彈之爆炸藥，就無從合製，雖然TNT或Dynamite應用較廣，但硝化甘油總是炸藥之一大來源；每日不可或缺之紙烟與化粧品，都離不了甘油，又如人體每日所吸取之營養素，也離不開「油」或「脂」，尤其是許許多多工業，都離不了油脂，吾人認淸了這點，工業油脂之重要，實不下於礦質油脂。</p>
<p>工業油脂所含種類甚多，其應用最廣者，厥爲柏油，牛油，椰子油，桐油數種，其他若干食用脂油，除少數仍作工業油脂外，其犖犖大者，就是上述四種。</p>
<p>柏油爲柏木所產之柏籽所榨成，上海市上所交易的，以「禾本」爲最。禾本係嘉興本車力簡稱，坪油爲浙江威坪，（皖浙交界）所產，蘭油爲浙江蘭谿所產，又如「名尖」，「尖麻」，「麻城」，「拆雪」，「荆柏」等，或爲洲北貨或爲湖南貨，多由漢口轉口而來，每年旺季，爲十二月，產季爲十男，大部份係供製土臘燭，皂廠亦可用以製皂，但其弊點，即無光澤，不如椰油之能發光，上年夏季，價爲每担五六萬元，本年禾本，最高價爲八十五萬元，較上年上漲十餘倍。最近四川梓汕，在滬推銷甚力。</p>
<p>牛油本市所通銷以蚌埠牛汕，本淘牛油爲最熱門，他如靑島等亦有來貨，每年銷路夏季稍淡，產期九月至四月，四月以後，無產出，本市本淘貨日產約二百担，尙須仰給外埠之補充，上年此時每担爲七萬元，今已騰升至一百十萬矣，顧以產區多淪爲戰區，市存甚薄，未來漲勢尙不可免，且各用戶均須囤足存貨，以待產季，故當此一時期爲購囤時期，過此則產銷均淡矣。</p>
<p>椰子油之來源，全係進口，小呂宋上年進口甚多，迨至目前，則來貨旣久無進口，存底亦亦極度稀薄，上年春價每担爲三十六七萬，八九月間，每担只售十一二萬元，本年二月每担達八十五萬之高峯，目前則已至一百廿萬矣。椰油香皂廠用途最大，皂廠亦不可或缺，現香港來價每担合一百五十萬元，市價尙低下三十萬元。</p>
<p>桐油爲外銷物資，但內銷用於油漆者，數亦甚大，尤以船舶之用量，每屆夏季修船，實銷甚大，比來以匯率過低，出口擯持，所給旣豐，價亦平穩，價格上年春爲每担五—七萬元，本年最高價曾達七十五萬元，現香港出口，已須架匯，故向香港走私之桐油，或可稍歛？桐油爲乾性油之最佳者，外銷前途旣差，內銷亦無生色，桐農在若干時期以後，植桐恐不感興趣矣。最近中信局有五萬噸桐油運日易貨，爲本年上海出口之最大數字。</p>
<p>他如猪油，茶油等亦有出口但爲數甚微，猪油每拒價爲六十五萬，茶油未聞市價，內地產量甚豐，但多爲食用者，羊汕皂廠亦有吸胃，湯淮（係從油水中取來故名湯油）則市上間有看到，價與羊油猪油相彷，還有一種蛋黄油，價亦不責不過甚少，但此種油脂，若以精製爲食用汕則其營養份甚大</p>

<h3>塘沽新港一瞥（上）</h3>
<p>— 天津八日航訊　邢契莘</p>
<p>塘沽在海河北岸，與大沽組望，東臨渤海灣，新港即建於此，地居東經一一七度四十分，北緯三十九度。</p>
<p>擄沽密通平津，其陸上交通，則與北　平綏平古津浦平漢各鐵路幹綫相連接，其水路交通，則上溯海河，以至北運南運大濟子牙諸河之上游，深內內地不下三千公里，若言海上，且可與沿海各埠及歐美各港直接通航，故塘沽新港佔有優越之地勢，為國際貿易上必需之施設。</p>
<p>塘沽新港與國內外各重要海港之距離如下：（單位海里）</p>
<p>靑島　四二五上海　六七八　香港　一四〇〇</p>
<p>廣州　一四九一大速一九五門　司七七〇</p>
<p>橫濱　一四一八四海參崴二九四馬尼拉一七三六</p>
<p>檀香山四六七七舊金山五六六四巴拿馬八七八八</p>
<p>加爾各答四四五〇倫教二〇三五</p>
<p>水文氣象</p>
<p>一，潮汐：根據海河工程局三十一年報吿，自一九一〇至一九四二年海河河口之平均漲潮位，高出大沽零點二五八公尺，以八月份為最高，平均為三公尺，其但潮位平均無〇·匹六公尺，平均潮差為二·一二公尺，潮流方向，漲時向北，速度每小時為二海里，潮漲時大沽口外之櫊江沙，全被淹沒，潮流與岸相接，類似平行漲潮，退潮時其流向南，速度侮小時為一海里，小潮時平流至轉流相距時間，常歷三四小時。</p>
<p>二，風力及風向：根據一九二九至一九三七年記錄，塘沽之風力，以西北風為最烈，平均最大風速率每小時達八六·四公里，風向以東南風最多，西北風次之，西南風又次之，至於風勢對潮流之漲落，影響極為顯著，當北風及西北風時，延緩潮漲時間，并減低潮高，東風與東南風時，則增加潮高，延緩退潮時間。</p>
<p>三，溫度：根據中央氣象局一九二八至一九三七年記錄，一月份平均溫度為攝氏水點下四·七度，最低為攝氏氷點下一八·九度，七月份平均溫度為攝氏二六·七度，最高為攝氏四〇度，一年平均溫度為攝民一二度，依據最近測候記錄，三十五年六月十一日，最高溫度為攝氏三七·七度三十六年一月二十六日最氏溫度為攝氏零下一五·九度，大沽口外海面竟至封凍，為十年來所罕有之現象。</p>
<p>四·雨量：根據一九〇九至一九三七年記錄，塘沽降雨量，全年平均為五〇三·七公厘，以七八月份無最多，約佔全年降雨量百分之七四·五，平均全年降雨日數為五三天，但三十五年平均降雨量為八三五·八公厘，八月十六日一日降雨量最大，計二〇一·九公厘。</p>
<p>五，冰：海河河口附近每年結冰時期，自十二月中句至次年二月底約兩個半月，其結冰之厚蘇，隨氣候而不同，本年一月二十六日，溫度為零下一五·九度，海口被封凍至二月下旬，風向由西北風轉為東風，冰塊漂走，航運始行恢復。</p>
<p>六，霧：塘沽霧天甚少，降霧時間亦極短，平均每年遇霧不過六七天。</p>
<p>一，絕對比重</p>
<p>第一泥樣　塘沽一號碼頭</p>
<p>第二泥樣　新港船閘東端</p>
<p>第三泥樣　天津海關碼頭</p>
<p>按揚子江神灘土質比重為二·七五，上海浦東馬路橋土質比重為二·七一，互相比較，可見塘沽之泥土較揚子江神灘之泥土為重，天津亦較上海之泥土稍重。</p>
<p>依照上列標準，經分析塘沽泥土之結果，所含成份，砂土少而黏土多，粒細而鬆浮，與揚子江神灘之淤土類似，至於天津之泥土，則砂土多於黏土，較諸上海泥土為粗糙，其泥土成分之百分比如附表。</p>
<p>觀於附表，塘沽之泥土，其中砂土佔百分之二六，黏土佔百分之五八，土質細而浮動，自然坡角度小，橫壓力極大，在建築工程上，此類土質易於壓縮，其塡成之地沉陷較速，故對於碼頭倉庫及陸上設備之建築設計，須加注意。</p>
<p>新港在海河之北側，因海河挾泥沙而下，淤積於大沽口外，成為撫江（俗稱大沽壩），素為航行之障碍，塘沽築港之目的，即在於避開大沽壩，另闢航道一條，新築船閘碼頭及一切設備，俾三千噸級輪船，隨時可循新航道，經過船閘直達天津，較大船舶則停泊港內裝卸貨物，茲將各重要工程之設備及運用，分述一於次：</p>
<p>地質鑽研</p>
<p>地質對於築港計劃，關係至為密切，塘沽沿海一帶地質為冲積層，日人在建港之初，曾沿新港南北兩側，由海岸起向海內伸入，每隔三千公尺鑽研海底各層地質各六處，又於岸上港內及北防波堤之北，鑽研三處，共計鑽研十五處，其深度由三五至五〇公尺不等，其結果地層面部大部份為褐色泥土，深約六公寸，下為暗褐色黏土、此層最廣，最深有深達十四公尺者，再下為暗褐色砂質黏土，褐色或灰色黏土質細砂·細粗砂·細砂·灰色黏土之類，間有貝毅混雜其間，各層參差，深度本一，要之不外此數種淤積層士質而已。</p>
<p>泥土試騐</p>
<p>新港一號碼頭後，及船閘東端泥土，曾經作絕對比重及土粒分析試騐，並與天津上海兩地泥士比較，茲將各項試騐結果，分述於次：</p>
<p>比重　二·八八〇</p>
<p>比重二·七九八</p>
<p>比重二·七一六</p>
<p>土粒分析</p>
<p>採用美國農部化學土壤局之泥土分類，為試騐之標準，其分類如次：</p>
<p>橫防波堤</p>
<p>防波堤之修築，在於防止泥沙之侵入，及西北風之襲擊，南防波堤起自船閘，向東塡築直入深海，長約十七公里，北防波堤起自第二碼頭，成一梯形伸入海中，長十。公里，均僅一部份完工，因地基由泥砂沉澱而成，地質鬆弛，故用拋石式堤工，下部拋石任其沉下，堤上舖墊洋灰方塊以穩固堤基，又於匯連內築造長六百五十公尺之橫防波堤，使海浪激盪，不致影響港內，以保內港水面之平靜，便於船隻停泊。</p>
<p>航道開鑿</p>
<p>南北防波堤之問，開盤航這一條，東通深海，經過船閘以與海河銜接，全長約十三·四公里，原來計算寬度二百公尺，已挖寬度一百三十公尺，深度五公尺，因防波堤未完工，受潮水激盪之影響，漂砂流入港內，以致航道淤塞，雖盡力疏濬，仍未達到預期之效果，停工以後，航道淤塞日甚一日，自三十四年八月至三十五年九月，一年之間，淤墊在一公尺以上，尤以船閘及第一第二碼頭附近淤塞尤甚，水深僅在二至三公尺之間，其餘約三公尺左右。</p>
<p>第一第二碼頭前停泊地，長約一千四百公尺，寬度連同航道在內為四百公尺，原來已挖深至六公尺，據三十五年九月實測結果，平均水深僅二公尺左右，淤寒之烈可想而知。</p>
<p>塡築土地</p>
<p>塡築工程，係由海河左岸之悔岸綫，向海面塡築約五千公尺之土地成為三千二百萬平方公尺之港灣用地，所用土方數量約達一千三百餘萬立方公尺。</p>
<p>碼頭船閘</p>
<p>為使於船隻停泊起見，計劃沿塡築地之南側，由西而東，修築第一第二碼頭，第一碼頭長七百公尺，護岸工程完成約百分之九十，可以使用，第二碼頭長三百五十公尺，水深八公尺，護岸工程完成百分之六十，建有裝煤機二座，以供煤鹽出口之用，所措日人投降以後，電機鐵釉皮聲多被盜竊，幾乎前功盡廢。</p>
<p>為使輪船不待潮汐即可直達天津起見，乃有船閘之建造，船閘位於海河河口之北岸，東　外港，西通海河，其用途在於可使海河之流砂，仍由原有河道入海，以免淤　港口，且可隨潮汐高下，啓閉閘門，以調劑水位，俾可隨時通航，又在船閘河側上游二十公尺度，設三角洲一處，以防海河泥砂流入閘底，計船閘長一百八十公尺，寬二十一公尺，閘身為鐵筋洋灰所築，閘門為推移式，用七十五馬方電機司啓閉之用，水位在五公尺左右，三千噸以下輪船，可以隨時通過。</p>

<h3>論公務員的級俸</h3>
<p>— 羅必達</p>
<p>公務員待遇依最近的調整，京滬區基本數三十四萬元，加底薪一千八百倍。所謂底薪，即是級俸；公務員的級奉是衣公務員敘級條例規定的。現行公務員敘級條例，係經立法程序，由國民政府於卅四年十一月一日修正公布；全文凡十六條，簡單扼要，足以稱道之處很多，但尚未能盡善盡美。茲就管見所及，謹提供改進意見，深願賢達學者指敎。</p>
<p>第一，條例規定初任簡任薦任職人員，自本職最氏級起敘（第三條）；此種規定，似欠公平合理。因依此規定，初任蔫任科員者，應敍薦任科員最低級，即薦任十二級。薦任十二級月俸一百八十元，較委任一級月俸二百元者，反少二十元。但薦任資格之一，為現任或曾任最高級委任職三年以上，僅餘敘合格者（現行公務員任用法第三條第三款）。這樣由委任而薦任，雖升了官等，却减了月俸；就被升奢的心理說，當然是絕不痛快的。</p>
<p>或者有人以為官與俸應該　有分別的，官是官，俸是俸甚至於可以不支俸。但這究竟是特例，而且祇限於最高級的官員。至於中下級的小公務員，祇服務不支薪，可說史無前例。通常金有官使有俸，升官便加俸，因此由最高級委任職人員晋升蔫任職時，若其本職最低級在蔫任十級以下者，似不宜硬性規定自本職最低級起敘。</p>
<p>法律上的硬性規定，若是公平合理的，不但可以行得通，而且可以保證行得好的，當然應該硬性規定；不然便會有法外的規定，因而减輕了一般人守法的精神，例如：暫行文官宮等宮俸表說明部份（國民政府於卅五年三月四日明令修正公布施行）第三條規定：「高等考試及格人員任薦任科員者，由鷹任十級起敍」。又如公務員任用補充辦法年資計算表上規穴：大學畢業有專門著作經審查合格者，得以薦任十級起敍。再如三十三年十一月三十日，銓敍部辦理外交部薦任科員王學曾任用級俸案銓定：曾任委任一級，改任薦托科員者，自薦任十級起敍。</p>
<p>由於這種例外，初任蔫任職人員，自本職最低級起敍的規定，已不能保持其尊嚴和完整了。而法外立法，法上制法，弄得法多如牛毛；使人不知適從，倒不如修正原條文，取消例外規定的為上。</p>
<p>第二·條例規定：初任委任職人員，合於公務員任用法第四條第四款之規定者，自八級至六級起敍，（第四條第一項第三款），所稱公務員任用法第四條第四款，即是曾致力國民革命五年以上，而有成績經證明屬實者的規定，合於此項規定者，以制十級至六級起敍，似亦未妥。因會致力國民革命七年以上，而有成績經證明屬實者，有任薦任職的資格（公務員任用法第三條第四款），曾致力國民革命十年以上，而有　勞經證明屬實者，更有任簡任職的資格（公務員任用法第二條等四款）。五年以上而未滿七年者，即自五年起至七年差一月或一天止，這樣時問之差仍甚微，則級俸之差也應甚近；何况成績之優劣與時間之長短，並不絕對成正比。曾致力國民革命五年以上未滿七年者的成績，可以優於曾致力國民革命七年以上，甚或十年以上的成績。因此吾人以為宜修正為：合於公務員任用法第四條第四款的規定者自八級至一級起敍，至於規定範圍內，起敍級的決定，應根據擬任人員曾致力國民革命的成績·時間·學歷·經歷·以及辦事能力為標準而決定。</p>
<p>第三條例規定—初任委任職人員，專科以上學校畢業者自五級至四級起敘；（第四條第一項第二款），高級二學畢業者自九級起敍（第四條第一項第四款）；初級中學畢業者自十六級至十級起敍（第四條第一項第五款）。但高初中畢業者以其有關之任用法定有多該項資格者為限（第四條第二項），此種規定，似可商確。</p>
<p>專科學校招收高中畢業生，肄業年限多為兩年。高中招收初中畢業生，肄業年限為三年。這樣專科學校畢業者較高中畢業者，肄業期間僅多兩年；所起敘級俸高四級甚或五級。但高中畢業者較初中畢業者，肄業期閒多三年，而起敍最高級之差僅一級，似嫌相差過少。專科以上學校畢業者以委任五級至四級起敍，尚屬適當；高中畢業者的起敍級，似乎缺乏單生，宜恢復舊條例的規定，自九級至八取起改，初中結業者宜修正為自十六級至十二級起敍。</p>
<p>猶有進者，吾人以為在規定限度內，決定擬任人員起敘之級，應根據左列標準：</p>
<p>（一）觉得歷与擬任职务性质是否相当，相当者应高，不相当者該低，使覺得以致用，使達到專家政治之目的；</p>
<p>（二）在校成績之優劣，優者應高，劣者該低，以配合覺得校敎育，而寓有使覺得子勤覺得之助用；</p>
<p>（三）行政經濟歷之無，有者宜高，無者宜低；</p>
<p>（四）辦事能力之強北，強者當高，弱者當低；</p>
<p>（五）肄業法定年限之長短，如專科覺得校法定　業年限為兩年，大覺得為四年，則後者高，前者低，似較公平合理。</p>
<p>第四，關於覺得校肄業生因輟覺得而任公務員，其肄業資歷條例上不予承認，似可商權。固然肄業生應勉其畢業，但在不安定的社會中，繳納覺得校費用過重的現狀下，不得不由中途輟覺得者為數年在增加，公務員所得難以維掛本身溫飽，當在飢餓上掙扎；所缴鉅額學校費用，十九日變賣書籍，古物·珍品·衣着，以及借貸之所得；設若　賣吿啓，借貸無門，不能槍擊偷校肄業生因輟學而任公務員者，應承認其肄業資歷，以其豈業前畢業資歷起敍之級為標準。依其肄業之成績及年數，得提高一級或二級起級。</p>
<p>最後，吾人尚須特別鄭重提出一點；即是「命令不能變更法律的規定」。現在憲法已經公布，憲政即將開始，應該有法治的精神。憲法應該高於伕律，法律應該高於命令。命令不能牴觸法律，法律不能遠背憲法。法律違背憲法者應無效，命令牴觸法律者也應無效。這是憲政時期法治的基本原則。現行公務員叙級條例，是經立法程序，由國民政府於卅四年十一月一日修正公布施行的。依據法律制定標準法的規定，凡經立法程序，由國民政府公布者稱法：伕包括條例。因此現行公務員叙級條例當然是法律。而「暫行文官官等官俸表說明部份」，是卅五年三月四日由國民政府令行的，未經立法程序，當然不是法律，而是命令。再銓級部的任用敘級銓定案，旣未經立法程序，也未曾由國民政府公布，當然其效力低於法律，低於國民政府命令。但現行公務員叙級條例規定：初任荐任職人員自本職最低級起叙（第三條），荐任科員本職最低級為荐任十二級，初任荐任科負者依法應自荐任十二級起叙。而「暫行文官官等官俸表說明部份」規定：高等考試及格人員任荐任科員者由荐任十級起叙（說明第三條），銓叙部的任用叙級案銓定由委任升任荐任科員者，自荐任十級起叙。這不是顯然的命令變更法律，否認法律的規定嗎？雖然這種變更是合理的，這種否認是合情的，根據法律本乎理與情的制定的原則說，應該變更，但以法治的精神說，這種辦法是不妥的。法律由專家草擬，經立法委員商討，剛完成立法程序時，大都是很理想的；一到實際運用時，便不免發現瑕疵。但不能因其有瑕疵，便可以用命令變更法律的規定；也不能因有法律的規定，便不管結果是否良好，而硬執行到底。執行應依法，而法能盡善盡美，才是理想。現行公務員叙級條例旣有修正的必要，自望立法當局能予以修正；使公務員的級俸能完得公平合理，使公務員的待遇雖薄，生活雖苦，也能安心工作，質之賢達學者，不知以為如何？</p>

<h3>先知</h3>
<p>— 閔子</p>
<p>上帝的先知，至高的探求者——亞　斯達法，在阿法利斯城中告訴了衆人關於生和死中間的一切，便趁着他的帆船回長生島去了</p>
<p>當他與阿法利斯的民衆分別的時候，他說：</p>
<p>「我在你們中間的日子是很短的，而我所說的話是更短了。</p>
<p>「但等我的聲音在你們的耳中模糊，我的愛在你們的記憶中消滅的時候，我要重來。</p>
<p>「我要以更豐滿的心，更受靈感的唇說話。</p>
<p>「是的，我要隨着潮水歸來</p>
<p>「雖然死要遮藏我，更大的沉默要包圍我，我却要尋求你們的瞭解。</p>
<p>「而住，我這尋求不是徒然的。</p>
<p>「假如我所說的都是眞理，這眞理要在更淸澈的聲贊中，更明白的言語裏顯示出來。」</p>
<p>如今過去已幾十年了，先知聲音在人們耳朵裏糢糊了，在記憶中朦朧了。</p>
<p>他重又趁着那條帆船從長生島來到了阿法利斯。</p>
<p>那個女預言者愛爾美差從聖殿裏走出來，迎接這一個被民衆愛戴着的「當代的曙光」。</p>
<p>愛爾美差向他說：</p>
<p>給我們用像溪流一樣淸澈的聲音說眞理吧！用更明白的言語把「風理」披露給我們，沒有一點隱晦。</p>
<p>上帝的先知溫讀微笑着。</p>
<p>時間</p>
<p>時間是一個最無情的脚色。它把我與你們間拖開了幾十毛，又帶走了跳躍在你們心靈深處的我的聲音。</p>
<p>它並不為了你才跑得快，同樣地它也並不為你而停住了向前的步子。</p>
<p>像一條溪水，很自負地不捨晝夜地流着。</p>
<p>你要知道它的力量嗎？——它會把你從搖籃一直拖進墳墓。</p>
<p>你工作，你愛，像它一樣沒有　隙。</p>
<p>這樣，它祗能拖着你的軀殼走，你的精神曾永生；</p>
<p>否則，跟着你的臭皮囊一起都歸於幻滅。</p>
<p>祇有將來才是你的，過去的都成了史家筆下的歷史；再由它送給後來者去作無情的批判：是善良還是醜惡？</p>
<p>好好地生活，好好地做人。阿法利斯的民衆呵！時間並不因為世上有貧當貴賤而有着什麼差別的。</p>
<p>節約</p>
<p>這是一個好各詞，但也並不頂好。</p>
<p>上帝並沒有造過這一個各詞，正如上帝沒有時你們縱情於淫樂一樣。</p>
<p>這猶如一盤珍貴的佳餚，對於給天災人禍蠶蝕着的人們是多餘的奢侈，但不倦於淫樂的却帶要它。可是他們偏偏把這菜餚給予不合胃口的人。</p>
<p>千萬塊樹皮與觀音粉。</p>
<p>千萬碗糠粃與麥糊，</p>
<p>怎樣也抵不上半席谿尾酒。</p>
<p>（阿伕利斯的民衆呀！你們懂得「雞尾酒」這名詞嗎？）</p>
<p>給奢侈淫樂朦蔽了心靈的人，正是以歌唱一般動人的聲音在喚着節約口號的人，而他們自己却是例外。正如從前的帝王們制定了法律而自己並不受其約束一樣。</p>
<p>記着：挺好的謊騙是一支美麗的歌。</p>
<p>但最高的理智決不會被歌聲所朦蔽。因為節約對於你們已經成了苛求。</p>
<p>用你們挖掘樹皮的手挖掘你們自己的路，淫樂者的春天已經過去，將要來的是風雪的寒冬。</p>
<p>婚姻</p>
<p>像兩匹牲口，在主人「咄！你們好好地住在一起」的呼叱下結合的婚姻制度已經過去了。</p>
<p>於是你們懂得了戀愛，知這了不僅憂形體的結合，而求更深的心與心的合流，默契。</p>
<p>大腹買他們對於這個道理是頃生的。</p>
<p>他們窮奢極慾的生活是釣魚的餌，祇有貧賤的魚見才會上他的鈞。</p>
<p>有一天自己從糜爛的生活裏倒下去，不堅固的愛情的基石也隨着坍塌了。</p>
<p>好的婚姻的媒介決不是金條與美禁，你看夜鶯的酬唱何嘗為了物質的需求？</p>
<p>漂亮的外貌不一定會包裹一顆美麗善良的心，這樣的選擇是一種愚蠶，一種在妄的錯誤。</p>
<p>你們要彼此相愛，一同飲乳酪，但也一同飲苦酒。</p>
<p>一根弦子彈出的是單調的音節，必須用兩根，彈起來才會和諧。</p>
<p>彼此顯出自己的心，沒有一些隱匿。</p>
<p>好的婚姻是事業的開始，否則無星用兩個人的手去捆自己的　　，比起一個人來更要迅速。</p>
<p>友情</p>
<p>友情是世界上最珍貴的一件東西。但是它不是一塊寶石，却比寶石更可　炫。</p>
<p>它並不是建築在物質基礎之上。如果你與你的朋友在徵逐酒食上獲得了它，這猶如建築於砂礫上的塔。</p>
<p>除了彼此心靈的加深，愛的更深理解以外，友情不能有別的目的。</p>
<p>它猶如一條溫柔的手，</p>
<p>它擦乾你的眼淚，撫撲你的創傷，使你的痛苦獲得至高的慰藉。</p>
<p>它又像春天的風，那樣暖暖地緊貼着你的心。世界上沒有比這更甜蜜，更柔和。</p>
<p>它更勝於母親的心。</p>
<p>友情不是商品。有人向你要的時候你不該吝裔，你要慷慨地給予；</p>
<p>但是在不必要的時候，你也不應該像劣等的貨物一樣廉價出售。</p>

<p>印之制，發源至古，遞嬻及漢而大盛。作印必宗漢，猶書之於晋，詩之於唐也。然古印多取材金玉，篆與刻為二事，作篆者雖業槃各家，而笵鑄刓鑿之勞，輒假手工匠；故士林罕以刻印稱者。降至元明間，有花乳石之製，石之性脆，易受刃，隨意之所至而臻妙。屬文之士，每好此寄興，於是印人輩出。惟文勝則質缺，人不稽古，臆造自眩，新奇相競；刻雖工而篆則悖，印之義晦矣。有淸一代，金石之學大昌，篆刻乃入於正，而以浙皖二宗為歸。會稽趙悲會，獨鎔冶衆長，自闢新境；所作最為雅馴，而學步頗不易。錢子君匋，治印有年，用力勤，求其似悲會者，盡得其精髓。積稿旣富，將集拓以質當世，間序於余。余素重悲　，喜君甸之能擇善而師也，異於今之閉門造畢自矜創獲者流。嘗謂篆刻雖小道，非天資人事兼臻不能工，徒抱舊譜，不足以語大；必精　篆權，飽覽金石器物文字，以簡練之，賡通之，合古而不泥，　新而自卓；席鍥而應手，恢乎有餘刃。悲　之勝人處，蓋在於此。君匋治印旣神似悲　矣，再進而師其所師，則並暫悲　不難也．雖然君匋恂恂者，多龍事，書書文學音律靡不長，他日又豈筑以印人傳耶！爰樂而為之序。</p>
<h3>靑春的祝福</h3>
<p>— 李文動</p>
<p>推開窗來，迎面一陣好風，吹得我心旌搖蕩，一棵夾竹桃滿載着春光，好久以來，我就已失却這種靑春的矚望了。</p>
<p>我常想起荷蘭畫家梵高底一幅題作「春」的風景畫，在廣大的，陰沉沉的，蘭着灰雲和薄霧的天空下面；各處的風，在曠野襄停留，有一點懷疑，有一點趦趄。在一座低矮的草屋前面，一片窮乏，荒凉的田野中間，一趣孤單的桃樹默默的垂頭，忍受着寂寞和春寒，吐放着幾朶慘淡的小花，它以堅定的姿勢在倔强的生長，枝幹內彷彿還滾動着血流的聲音，這種聲音很像嘉陵江上昇起的，充滿了凄凉，也充滿了信心的船夫底歌聲。</p>
<p>這是一個眞實的，慘淡的春天，也正是棗的我們這一代的命運，我們底全部靑春，都獻給抗戰了。</p>
<p>很早，我便被一種思想所壓倒，和窗前一棵矮冬靑那樣，完全變成一個小老頭兒了。心的衰老是東歸以後的事，至於形體這一方面，長期的工作和流浪使我靑春凋敗。但那時候心地尚是健旺的，一直到勝利歸來，高高興興的回到兒時江南，一回到江南就變了，兒時友伴都成了陌路，我所愛過的女孩已成了嫂婷少婦，有一個女孩在襁褓時代我還曾抱過逗着玩兒，如今見了我已羞得抬不起頭來，並且聽說學曾了戀愛。還有更多的已經作古，有的死於皇軍底「宣撫」，有的死於流亡和疫癘，有的尋了短見，有的就這麼糊裏糊塗的失掉了。</p>
<p>從這些不斷的生長和死亡，我才第一次感知了靑春的老去。</p>
<p>杜甫在贈給衛八處士的詩中說：</p>
<p>「……；少壯能幾時，鬢髮各　已蒼</p>
<p>訪舊半為鬼，驚呼熱中腸</p>
<p>……」</p>
<p>小時候讀讀毫無意思，現在一讀就心跳不止，正像但丁底詩句；「方我生之中途……」當時法國作家法郎士讀了隨手丟開，後來當他自己走入中年的時候，無意中再讀到這個詩句，全身就顫慄起來了。</p>
<p>瞬間的驚覺使我瑟瑟發抖，加之那時候還是冬天，寒冷和寂寞，一步緊逼一步，情形有相當狼狽。當我想起我曾活過，愛過，工作過，受過苦，那些日子呵，充滿了飢餓，轟炸，殘殺，流亡，愛和淚，熱情和夢想……</p>
<p>但春天還是照樣來，一切都是老標子，和我們過去所碰到的春天沒有什麼不同，漢口的春天，重慶的春天，成都的春天，昆明的春天，和戰地的春天，人生也許原是個容易零落的筵席。</p>
<p>現在我又回到江南的春天裏來，年輕男女的嘴邊都掛着一隻呌「薔薇處處開」的歌，這個歌我是從來沒有聽過的，他們唱得生氣勃勃，當我走過他們前面，他們全不看我一眼。</p>
<p>江南的春天是多麼娟好，陽光照得我眼花撩亂，一條小河流得生動，一棵杏花紅得嫣然；河岸上。草色靑靑，綠的麥苗和黃的油菜花，天際白雲舒卷，大路上，一雙雙，一對對，賣花的姑娘飛送着媚眼，把風情全放在眼角上，聰明的少年郎打情罵俏，姑娘們羞得掩面伏身而笑。這是多好哇！祇是我已經老了，像多情的屠格湟夫站在一個荒凉的驛站上，向過去吿別，以悲苦的，甜蜜的心情給他們以祝福：</p>
<p>「未來是屬於你們的，你們的生活要比我們容易，不會再像我們一樣械迫在黑階中我尋道路，掙扎，跌倒又爬起，我們得苦痛的尋找那支持我們的力量，我們中間有好多人是失敗了—可是你們，你們祇要好好工作，像我這樣的祝福是為了你們，我雖然有着悲哀，却並無嫉妬，也沒有一點陰暗的惑情……」</p>
<p>生命的歌永不休止，一曲一曲的唱下由，換來新的日子和季候，而我們是已經活過，愛過，受過苦……除了給你們祝福，還有什麼別的好說呢？</p>
<h3>黃沙</h3>
<p>— 陳頴</p>
<p>我怕黃沙散落的季節。</p>
<p>我怕迷眼的沙子……</p>
<p>窗外明麗的晴天，突然變成黃渾渾的了。有大風撲向了窗檻，也樸向了我。</p>
<p>這又是飄降黃沙的日子。</p>
<p>當土地沉溺在迷灌的風沙中時，有年老的牧羊人，在憂鬱裏嘆息。也有人說沙漠中行走的旅人和駱駝，被沙丘埋葬了，從此就水遠沒有他的消息。</p>
<p>而我的心，也在這霉的日子裏發悸。</p>
<p>當黃沙落在山野，落在每家的屋頂，當黃沙落在橋頭，落在伸向遠方的路而；於是，我看見朦朧的沙霧裏，山崗像一座一座飄浮的小島嶼，鴿色的雲朶，像萎謝的雛菊。</p>
<p>但，我却看不見太陽，看不見在路上行走地旗的行列。</p>
<p>雖然，迷離的風沙，封鎖了每個人的眼睛，而我們的呼吸更接近，我們的手携得更緊，我們活躍的心，會迎向搔破綿密沙網而出的爽朗的藍天……</p>

<h3>羅曼羅蘭　談寫作</h3>
<p>— 言川</p>
<p>法國文豪羅曼羅關，有幾條對於寫作很珍貴的意見，於初學寫作的人很有參考價值，現在把它摘錄在下面：</p>
<p>一，第一個勸吿：除非你迫切的感到由於社會的責任和你的良心，或去某一種內心的需要所驅使時，決不要寫作。僅僅為了妄想或者虛榮而去參加到那早就為數已多的作家行列裏，這不僅是無益而且有害的。</p>
<p>二，當寫作的時候，必須誠實·一個作家只應該寫出眞實，寫出什麼是你所想到的看見的以及你所相信的。</p>
<p>三，一個作家必須努力用最大可能的正確精密與直接，也是最簡明的形式，叙述出眞實來；這裏就隱藏着風格的全部秘密。當一個作家在這方面毫無遺憾的時候，他就能寫得很好。但是道非常困難的，因為一個作家，必須經常地艱苦工作着，才能把思想從他的外殼，從他的灰土，從所有一切掩蓋着他的黑暗，混亂的和不必要的事物裏解放出來。</p>
<p>四，這樣的勞作必須自己來做，因為侮個人都必須同他自已的缺點作鬥爭，任何人也都是他的審判者。但是這種努力，是可以由偉大而優美的占典文學名著而取得很大便利的。一個作家應研究這些名。作總的結構，篇章的組織，以及在這些篇章之中的句子的稱造，思想的邏輯，與字眼的價值。</p>
<h3>吳歈百絕</h3>
<p>— 樹滋</p>
<p>以前雖住在蘇州有一年多，但對於蘇州的地方文獻總不感興趣，普通詩文集不用說，偶然翻閱「吳郡文編」的目錄，已覺昏皆欲睡，原因是對於小擺設式的地方掌故之類，索無好感。偶然也曾雜覽一些右蘭吳中的文獻，但大抵以俗書為主·如「吳下　聯」，「吳　詩鈔」之類，本是俗人，所注意也只以俗事為限，目的只是想從書本中得一些風習，語言之類的零星智識而已。</p>
<p>這類記戰俗事的書，我所喜歡的也有幾種，蔡雲「吳歈百絕」只是其中之一。</p>
<p>原書一卷，同治十一年壬申刋本。書　有石　跋文，敍刻書經過說：</p>
<p>「元和蔡　耕先生，以制　負重名，平時執經從學者恒數十人。身後門弟子程賡堂（　梅）孝廉為刻其詩文全集，蓋道光初事也。當時余會有其集，亂後失之。近鈔得其「吳歈百絕」一卷，妹夫蘇君雅靑……　為重刻，余喜其表彰文獻，足以資吳下舊聞，刻旣蓋為敍巔末如此。」</p>
<p>按蔡氏名雲，字立靑，號鐵耕，元相人，生乾嘉間。著有：「蔡氏月令章句」四卷，「癖談」四卷，「借秋亭詩草」八卷，見曹允源「吳縣志」卷五十八（上）「藝又考」（四）。另有「借秋亭制藝」一種。「吳歈百絕」，據石天跋文，似原刻於「詩草」中。單刋本首有蔡氏自序，不署年月，不知作於何時。序云：</p>
<p>「雲地著吳市，天生吳獃，小唱吳　，粗談吳俗。攬一年之勝槪，蒐三邑之新聞；貯謠　於詩瓢，藏　規於笑柄。蓋　時隨事，可詠可歌矣。」全書主旨也不外詠述歲時風俗，略如柳枝，竹校之類。</p>
<p>顧祿（鐵卿）「淸嘉錄」中引詠吳俗的詩很多，常引的有周宗泰「姑蘇竹枝詞」（六首）和蔡氏「吳歈百絕」二種，而引蔡詩最多，計七十餘目，佔蔡氏原書四分之一。但原詩所附的案語，多被「清嘉錄」刪節，即徽引原詩，也路去小註。在我們看來，註比詩更重要（註中多詳記吳俗，顧氏的刪削，眞是「買櫝還珠」了。得見原書，本來面目較之僅見顯氏的刪本，却是幸事。</p>
<p>詩凡一百首，和一般竹枝詞無異，但小註則頗翔寔。如：「看殘大燭鬧元宵，　出孕船忙打招。不放月華浸下界，炳竿　塔又星橋。」註云：</p>
<p>「十三觀大糧於劉猛將同，燭高數尺。十五夜鳴鉦　為樂，號鬧元宵。陸行仿競渡樂聲，石湖詩自註所謂划旱船者是也。龍舟掉尾旋轉，俗名打招。烟火製類爆竹，植長竿縣放，人馬城闕，俱從火中噴出。每放一架，有故事數劇者。凡係橋樑，必值本桅，置架如塔形，逐層張燈其上。衢巷亦置竿引索，作造橋燈。案「石湖詩集」盛稱上元燈市，有萬眼羅，琉璃毬者，尤妙天下。今俗惟此數種及小兒戲弄諸燈而已。至二　間燈綵方盛，然猶間歲一為之。」</p>
<p>又如記新年詩：「灶山簾掛井蘭封，燒過頭燒拜喜容。百歲錢文盤內派，萬年糧米案頭供。」註云：</p>
<p>「俗呼灶陘曰灶山，有　供神馬，迎祭畢，蔽以簾云。新正三日不汲水，供神馬於井嗣上，祭而搶之，曰封。元且燒香以早為虔，夜半即有趕頭香者。展掛先世遺像，或五日，或半月而收。以果盤派兒童輩，內有百歲錢。年頭忌不淘米，留淘數日供之，號萬年糧。」</p>
<p>又記端陽云；「秤錘粽子滿盤堆，好侑雄黃酒數杯，餘瀝尚堪祛五毒，亂　兒額噀牆限。」註云：</p>
<p>「裏黍無角者，名秤錘粽，端午節物也。端午飲萬滿酒，今更和以雄黃。俗以蟾蜍，蜥蜴，蜘蛛，蛇，蚿為五毒。」</p>
<p>所記都翔實可觀，比魯高一層。故小註更值得重視。</p>
<p>記戲吳中風俗的書，前人有范成大「石湖樂府」黃省會「吳風錄」，王稈登「吳社編」；近人有：局振鶴「蘇州風俗」，顧振玉「蘇州風俗談」等。如能分類輯錄，也可成像「北平風俗類徵」那樣的書，「吳歈百絕」正是這書重要資料之一。但這事此刻似乎還談不到。</p>

<h3>第六感覺與第八識</h3>
<p>— 陳子琦</p>
<p>美國丟克大學心理學家萊恩敎授，和他助手費了十七年的研究工夫，證明一個人在視，聽，嗅，味，觸，五覺之外，有第六感覺的存在。這第六感覺，也稱做超外感覺。凡是精神正常，感覺敏銳的人，都有這種第六感覺的可能。牠的作用，能預測未經見到的東西和事情，不受空間時間的阻隔；能惑受其親屬同樣的痛苦，甚至遭受同樣的不幸。這種超外感覺，在有密切關係的人，如孿生子和夫婦等，其作用就格外顯著。美國著名的幸福雜誌，曾經舉出很多的例子，來證明這椿心理學上重大的發現。這的確是很可驚喜的事情。</p>
<p>不過，據我個人所知，這第六感覺，就是佛經裏所說的第八識，也稱做阿賴耶識。那第七識是末那識，第六識則就是意識。這第八識的範圍，非常廣關，它與地球上整個人類以及各種生物是互相交涉的。是每個人都有的，（不論他的精神是否正常）不但是每個人都有，而且是每一動物都有，不論它怎樣細小。當然母子，夫婦之間，它們有着切膚的關係，這第八識的作用，就很容易發現。孿生子因氣分相同的關係，它的作用也就格外顯著了。</p>
<p>舉個例子來說：在我們的歷史裏，有這樣的記載，說：曾子的母親，有一天她因為有樁緊急的事情，希望她的兒子在外面回來，就把她自已的指頭哎破。曾子正在山上砍柴，覺着一陣心痛，知道家裏不知出了什麼事情，就急急地回到家裏來。問他母親，方知他母親因為有些急事，曾經咬破她的指頭呢。還有，我們讀黃宗　萬里尋兄記。黃廷豐是憑着他思兄之切，在夢中得到了啓示，終於在道州一所廁所內，遇着了他的哥哥伯　。這都是藉着第八識的作用，發生感應的。</p>
<p>有人說。這第六感覺是和千星眼，催眠術的作用相彷彿的。因為催眠術受術者經施術以後，可以明白說出預先經人封藏的什物。不錯，催限術，千里眼的作用，的確和超外感覺（即吾所謂第八識）是有關係的。催眠術的受術者，必先把意識停止入催眠的狀態，方能起超外感覺的作用。佛敎敎人參暉，也無非是把自已的意識停止下來，讓第八識充分地運用，以打成內外一片的境界。不過這裏面的道理雖然相通，但是參　的境界，究非學習千里限行使催眠術者，所能夢見的。</p>
<p>末了，這第八識的功用，即在儒家也未嘗不知。中庸上面說：「不减無物，」就是要人不要專靠平常的第六意識來測度一切。因為這意識是最靠不住的；最不能明瞭事物眞相的，所以如果要明瞭事物的眞相，必須把道意識的妄念停止下來，「止於止善」，然後纔能發明「明德」的功用、然後纔能誠則有物，明白事物的眞相。所謂「至誠之道，可以前知」，就是這個道理，這裘面所說的「明德」，就是第八識的體性。曾子把它的功用發揮地說：「上下與天地同流」，能與天地上下同流，那不是第八識是甚麼？</p>
<p>這第八識的體性和功用，佛敎經論，有很詳盡的說明。不過要研究它，也不是一件容易的王作。我們倒歡迎萊恩敎授和其他研究第六感覺的心理學家，到中國來研究第八識，以窺破這神秘的宇宙！</p>
<h3>餐時的態度</h3>
<p>— 郭永年</p>
<p>有一次美國一實騐室舉行一種試騐，以貓一頭　以猪肝等豐美食料，候牠撲在地上安靜瞌睡後，即用愛克司光鏡透視其內藏情形，見其食物的消化工作順利進行。突然間，以預先放在幕後的留聲機發出一陣惡犬狂吠聲，該貓立即拼命一跳，曲背豎毛，張牙舞爪起來，這是外表的變化，自愛克司光鏡再視察其胃內情形，則見全胃充滿胃液，胃之蠕動方向與前相反，美味的豬肝，在其胃內竟似一塊塊之磚頭的不消化物了。</p>
<p>反觀我們人類，一日之中父母與子女多數可能相遇的時閒就在進餐的時候，這時做父親的常免不了要對子女平日的行為，讀書成績等等敎訓批評一番，做母親的免不了要對家用開支的節制加以辯護。就是做父親的自己。以這種態度來同家人同餐，心中亦未現樂意吧。這樣，如果用那愛克司光鏡來通視每個人的胃部的消化情形，就要同那受實騐的貓一樣。所以世人在製食時避免談論一切不樂意的事情，世界上消化不良，腎酸過多等胃病的發生可以减少許多了。</p>
<h3>愛麗斯上舞台</h3>
<p>— 果華</p>
<p>「愛麗斯漫遊奇境記」是一部著名的童話，中國也有好多種譯本。作者魯衛士卡羅爾是一位數學敎授，可是他這本童話却匪夷所思，異想天開，其中有會說話的兔子，有空中飛行的王后。以至於奇禽怪獸，不一而足。然而這部童話的好處，並不在於它的古怪，而在於愛麗斯這小姑娘雖在奇境之中，遇到干種萬種的奇事，却仍保持為一個現實的人物，環境雖然是荒誔不經到極頂，她的一舉一動却異常合乎理性。這也可說是這一部童話特別值得一讀的地方，最近這部小說，已經搬上舞台，在紐約「美國戲庫劇塲」上演。其中布景，完全與原書上坦尼爾的插盡一樣。尤其好的，是林斑比所串演的愛麗斯，完全與書中的女主角應有的一樣。她舉手投足，聲音笑貌，都與書中的人物一個神氣，換句話說，當時作者寫這部書，就像心目中早有林斑比這一個小姑娘了。</p>
<h3>吉普上的「蝴蝶」</h3>
<p>— 苞卿</p>
<p>吉普到處女郎隨。</p>
<p>美國吉普車到了三島，也不例外，同日本女郎結起綠來了。那些日本「蝴蝶」，也是以產賢妻良母著稱。好到丈夫領了一個女人回家來，和妻子同睡一床不以為奇的。美國軍人的品評，是有「親切的特質，柔順的性格，以及她們願使男子舒適的熱烈情緒。」</p>
<p>去年日本全國人口調查，女性多於男性約三百萬人。在這種過剩情形下，處於封建的社會環境，目前失業，肌荒迫臨的今天，日本女人的命運是更悲慘的。雖然日本婦女有普選權參政權了，但是無法解決那些姊妹們本身的困苦。</p>
<p>起初政府的「在外同胞援護會」的職業輔導課對來請求救濟的女性，到萬不得已，就介紹她們做女招待之類的事，甚至她們願為人之妾與賣淫。雖然去年一月一十四日，麥帥曾令日政府取消束縛婦女服役的一切契約和協定，剝奪了合法賣淫的權利。可是這僅是給可憐的賣身者，去了一重剝削而已。</p>
<p>美軍不但打動了那些自命高貴的藝妓的心，且有多少少女們投向他們的懷中。一個日女和美軍結婚，得到父母的允許，是因為他們以後可以得到經包，砂糖等，甚至美金，可見得徑濟關係的嚴重了。</p>
<p>這些親善的事，竟鬧到美國報上，聯合社記者的一張照片上，一個美軍兩臂抱着笑着的日本女郎。一位軍人太太竟以為這軍人就是他丈夫，要鬧離婚，逼得那丈夫親找攝影記者來證明其非。美軍們的在國內的眷屬，都為着這一類的事煩惱。</p>
<p>麥克阿瑟在這種情形下，不得不（於去年四月二日），給信隨氣牧師，要他設法阻止這種以「淫猥」來蒙蔽了「親善」。麥帥以為嚴禁與日人交際是絕對無法實行的，而且不能解決問題，違犯了美國軍人固有的自尊心和個人的權利。因此希望他們能保持高度的道德水準，否則，不僅壞了軍隊的名譽，美國的威信，還使他們的家庭感到非常的哀苦。因此要他們嚴守「克已」和「自身修養」兩點。</p>
<p>所以，為了自己，為了國家，吉普武士們，也該聽從一下要帥的話吧！其他各地的美軍也該聽聰。</p>
<p>「松花江上」畫面之一</p>
<h3>五月楷杷正滿林</h3>
<p>— 瑞</p>
<p>據本草云；「枇杷，葉似琵琶，故名，」廣志云：「枇杷葉微似栗，冬花春實，子簇結，有毛，四月熟，大者如　子，小者如龍眼，無核者名焦子。」據此，枇杷實已成熱，但佳種應市，恒在端陽前後，廣志所記者，大都為章稱等類耳。</p>
<p>枇杷之見於詩章者甚衆，如郭正祥詩云：「未知何處眞堪比，正恐飛實內蠟丸」。陳基詩云：「滿天風露枇杷熟，歸奉慈親取次嘗。」白居易詩：「淮山側畔楚江陰，五月枇杷正滿林」。東坡詩：「鷹橘微黃尚帶酸」。戴石屏詩：「東園戰滿西園醉，摘盡枇杷一樹金」。陸游詩：「枝頭不怕風搖落，樹上惟憂鳥啄殘」。皆名作也。</p>
<p>據廣志載，枇杷無核者為焦子，但欲使枇杷個個無核，亦可人迭，其法即於批杷始花時，摘去其花鬚即得。相傳秀水朱竹垞與某羽士為此事，曾有一段佳話：「某羽士觀由有枇杷兩株，每熟必體竹垞，剝啖之皆無核，間故不答，竹垞羽士嗜蒸豚，先購肉熟蒸，始邀之來，命傭另市　肩自外歸，故令羽士見，不逾刻即出以供客，羽士訝其何速，當之且已透熟，輾間竹垞速熟之法，垞曰：「欲以此易枇把種耳」。羽士曰：「無他，於始花時摘去其花鬚耳」。垞曰：「吾之肉亦無他，昨所預蒸耳」。言已相與捬堂，至今尚傳為美談也。</p>
<h3>元微之和嚴幾道</h3>
<p>— 杞人</p>
<p>今日上一代和下一代發生不少衝突的不良現象，像孟子上所說的：「夫子敎我以正，夫子未出於正也，則是父子相夷也，父子相夷，則惡矣！」因為「一樑不正下樑歪」的原故，所以社會上和家庭裏面的糾紛日見其多。</p>
<p>嘗笑古代文人亦多此病，如元微之　姪審云：</p>
<p>「吾生長京城，朋從不多，然而未嘗識倡優之家，不曾於喧譁縱觀。…………</p>
<p>後來他到陝府，作詩言志，乃有「一生自恣」之語，甚至於這樣寫道：「……那知我少年，深解酒中事，能唱犯聲詩，偏精變審義，含詞待殘拍，呌吵擲投盤……」這和誨姪　中的話頭，幾乎像出自兩個人的手筆，可云矛盾之至！，大概誨姪的話頭，是假裝的道貌岸然，騙騙孩子，而詩中在娼家吃酒擲盤……等，才是實情，所謂詩言志，言為心聲，便沒有一毫隱藏了。</p>
<p>我因此回想起我的前輩中一些假道學夫子，嘴裏說：「我在年靑時候如何如何循規蹈矩，非禮勿視，非禮勿言……」等等，其實都是假的。「遁辭知其所窮」，掩飾或豉吹，結果露出尾巴來，才越顯其醜！可是他們在老差成怒之後，又慣於說這樣的話了：「做土匪的總不願自己的孩子也做土匪，吃鴉片烟的總不願自己的孩子也吃鴉片烟」。這呌做「躬自薄而厚實於人。」</p>
<p>譬如兌元微之吧，他是可以這樣傲然說：</p>
<p>「你們不要學我的優處，應該學學我的好處，例如我的文學，就够你們後輩學習的了，你如果不學我的文章而　學我吃酒，擲盤一些浪漫暴躁行為，那是不對的！」</p>
<p>再如駡後　　得最痛快的嚴幾道，他在安徽　學監的時候，大抽其鴉片，學生指　他，他發怒了，跟着便發　論云：「有幾道之學問，抽鴉片可也，無幾道之學問而抽鴉片，不可也」。</p>
<p>這似乎便是天經地義，可以縣一此高論於國門，不能更易一字矣。然而這總是不能使後一輩心悅誠服的。無論是元微之式的偽裝。或嚴幾道式的眞怒，結果都同樣要呌下一輩看不起。</p>
<p>「以言敎者訟，以身敎者從」，今後我們還應該服膺這一句話，纔有敎育的眞價。</p>
<p>元微之和嚴幾道雖然也了不起，但他們倆了不起的地方，並不在乎他們能偽裝與憤怒。</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「可是，你總得帶一些行李才好，」許多人異口同聲地說。</p>
<p>祝兆年用手指了指坐在自己身下的那口小皮箱。</p>
<p>「有這一個就够了！餘下的你們哄着辦，能帶就帶，不能帶扔掉也沒有關係。」他抱着緋緋，怱怱地站起來。</p>
<p>緋緋也睜開跟請來，望大家看了一看，顯得怪留戀的。</p>
<p>可是老祝這一站起來，便給好幾位比較心細的同伴發現了一點困難，地們都捐心他一手抱緋緋，一手提皮箱，必不勝長途跋涉；而老給他這麼抱着，有病的緋緋也多累，經他們一說，祝兆年自己也想到了。大家商議結果，最後決定讓他把緋緋馱着走，當時就有一位女團員毫不思索地解下了一方質地很堅實的布包袱來，兜成一個　形，把緋緋拴在老祝的背上，這樣緋緋就不一定需要用手攀住老祝的肩膀，而老祝的雙手也可以騰空了。</p>
<p>「這探舒服嗎，緋緋？」大家者向緋緋問。</p>
<p>她的答覆是不出聲的一陣微笑；經過了這香勞動之後，她的精神仿彿反振作了些。　「緋緋把兔子給我，捧着怪吃力的。祝伯伯替你放在皮箱裏，好不好」？老祝旋過頭來這樣說。</p>
<p>「不，緋緋要抱着它，交給你會丟掉的。」她很天眞地回答：「要是眞丟掉了，把什麼還給弟弟？」</p>
<p>說得老祝和別人都笑了。</p>
<p>「那末，這樣，」老祝向國在他四周的許多同伴逐一點了點頭。「如果諸位覺得我們這個劇團還不願意解散，仍想維持下去的話，我主張你們應該先推舉一個負實的人，使一切事不致紊亂。」</p>
<p>大家都覺得很對，可是一時想不起應該推舉誰。</p>
<p>「我看，老鷹就是最遞當的人！」祝兆年指着　跛子說：「他很謹慎，年紀也比諸位大一些，，……」</p>
<p>話猶未了，周圍的人已柏起手來。</p>

<h3>National Army Continuously Arrives in Shenyang to Reinforce; Siping Battle Reaches Climax; Troops in Shandong Continue to Suppress Communists on Multiple Routes</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Sun Liren, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Security Command, arrived in Beijing from Shenyang by plane on the afternoon of the 15th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 15th] The reinforcements that the people of Northeast China have eagerly awaited have reportedly arrived in two divisions, and another division will arrive successively.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 15th] The great battle of Siping has reached its climax. Since the afternoon of the 14th, the Communist army has continuously bombarded the defending troops' positions from Xiaokagou in the western suburbs and the Lingshen Temple area in the southern suburbs with artillery. In the evening, they launched assaults with shock troops towards the southern suburbs, once every hour, with battle cries echoing throughout the night. On the 15th, part of the Communist army broke into Siping, resulting in street fighting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] Fierce fighting in the suburbs of Siping has continued uninterrupted for the past 48 hours. As of noon on the 15th, intense fighting was still ongoing. On the evening of the 14th, the Communist army launched several assaults under the cover of concentrated artillery fire, but were all repelled by the defending troops. The ground in front of the National Army's positions in the suburbs was littered with Communist corpses, and casualties were heavy. It is generally believed that the defense of Siping is only the beginning, and fierce fighting will likely continue. A high-ranking military official here told reporters today that the strong fortifications in the suburbs of Siping will destroy most of the invading Communist forces. These words have implied that the National Army's deployment and preparations may cause the Communist army besieging Siping to repeat the tragedy of their invasion of Dehui last winter.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 15th] The Communist army in the Benxi area is harassing northwest along the Shen-An Railway. In addition to Hualianzhai being occupied on the 14th, the situation at Shiqiaozi Station on the 15th is unclear. Railway employees have evacuated, and trains are only running to Waitoushan, which is 110 li from Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 15th] Gudianzai Station on the Ji-Chang Railway was occupied by more than 1,000 Communist troops at dawn on the 15th. The Huapichang wooden bridge was also burned down, and the Ji-Chang transportation was interrupted, leaving the two places isolated. The passenger train that departed from Changchun to Jilin on the morning of the 15th turned back at Xinglongshan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 15th] The Communist army besieging Jilin launched a blind attack on Paoziyan, more than 20 li southeast of Jilin, on the night of the 12th. On the 13th, they bombarded the area with fierce artillery fire, and the defending troops retreated. By the evening of the 13th, the Communist army had occupied the outer strongholds of Datun north of Jilin, Qipan Street, and the Paoziyan area in the southeast. The defending troops are preparing a counterattack.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 15th] The Communist army invading Yilaxi from Chalukou on the Ji-Chang Highway has destroyed the high-voltage power transmission line between Jilin and Changchun.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 15th] Nine columns of Communist troops who have been harassing the eastern side of the Yun-Ri to Lai-Xin Highway have suffered considerable losses after being suppressed by the National Army coming from Laiwu on multiple routes. In order to avoid being completely annihilated by the National Army, the Communist army has dispersed its main force into two parts. Furthermore, the Wang Jingjiu Corps of the National Army, which advanced towards the northeast of Xintai, drove back more than 30,000 troops from the 1st, 7th, and 8th columns of the Communist army who had sneaked into the vicinity of Nanshidian on the 14th, seizing numerous war trophies. On the 15th, the National Army continued to advance to the northeast and has surrounded the Communist army near Beishidian, and are currently annihilating them. Furthermore, the 3rd Column of the Communist army, which invaded the area north of Laiwu from Tusikou Jiuzhai, was blocked and attacked by the National Army, and after two days and nights of bloody fighting, the Communist army's offensive has been thwarted. In addition, on the 15th, the National Army in western Shandong annihilated more than 500 troops of the Communist Independent Brigade in the Wangxiaozhuang and Xinyangmiao areas, 15 kilometers southwest of Shanxian, capturing more than 100 prisoners. The remaining Communist troops fled south, and the National Army is pursuing them.</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Incident Shows No Development; We Quietly Await Soviet Reply</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Attention to the Beitashan incident in the capital has noticeably decreased. Our government is still quietly awaiting a reply from the Soviet side. As of the evening of the 15th, the Soviet reply had not yet been received. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet instructed Ambassador Fu Bingchang, stationed in the Soviet Union, to inquire about it, nor has it considered the next step.</p>
<h3>Border Security Measures Should be Proactive; Focus on New Transportation Lines</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Former Director of the Xinjiang Construction Department, Lin Jiyong, expressed his views on the Xinjiang incident, stating that border security should adopt proactive policies: (1) Two parallel railway lines should be built, connecting Xinjiang to Gansu and Qinghai respectively, creating a "double-track corridor." This would avoid the danger of the 3,000-mile-long Gan-Xin Highway being cut off at any time. If the construction of the railway is too slow to meet the need, a large number of aircrafts should be used to open up air routes. (2) Honest and capable officials should implement sound economic policies, with all measures aimed at enhancing the welfare of the people of the entire province, without any intention of competing with the people for profits.</p>
<h3>Requests to Protect Rights and Preserve Territory Continue to be Expressed in Various Places</h3>
<p>[Dihua] Local ethnic leaders, including Ma Zhanjun, Ha Wan, and Mujing A, believe that the situation in Xinjiang is becoming increasingly serious and that peaceful unification is in danger of being destroyed. They have initiated the organization of the "Xinjiang People of All Ethnic Groups United Association for Upholding Peaceful Unification." Yesterday afternoon, a preparatory meeting was held in Xigongyuan to issue a declaration on the current situation, denouncing those who undermine peaceful unification, and resolving to fight for the integrity of national territory and sovereignty. Nine representatives will be sent to Beijing to report on the Xinjiang situation to the National Government. Another nine people have been selected to appeal to the Executive Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the Garrison Headquarters, and all sectors of the province, requesting that they stop the riots and uphold the peaceful unification of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>[Beiping] Xinjiang natives residing in Beiping and Tianjin held a discussion meeting at the "Northwest Ethnic Promotion Association" in Beiping on the 14th to review the current Xinjiang issue.</p>
<p>[Changchun] The City Provisional Council made a solemn statement on the Xinjiang incident. The people of Northeast China are particularly disgusted with the acts of aggression backed by a certain party, as they witnessed the illegal acts of a certain army in Northeast China after the August 15th Restoration.</p>
<p>[Hankou] Eight people's organizations in Hankou, including agriculture, commerce, industry, women, lawyers, and education groups, recently sent a telegram to the central government, requesting effective measures to stop the Mongolian cavalry's invasion of Xinjiang.</p>
<p>[Wuxi] More than 300 students from the National Frontier School here sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang regarding the invasion of Xinjiang by Mongolian cavalry, requesting that he adopt a tough diplomatic stance and immediately dispatch strong reinforcements to protect the territory. This afternoon, all the students will hold a large parade in the city, singing songs to defend the border.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Cultural and educational groups such as the Hong Kong China Cultural Advancement Association and the Hong Kong Branch of the Overseas Chinese Education Association sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang, Director Zhang of the Northwest Executive Headquarters, border defense soldiers, and compatriots across the country on the 14th, calling for them to defend the territory and resist invasion to protect sovereignty. In addition, 82 groups, including the Hong Kong Wansheng Shipping, Industrial, and Commercial Federation, also jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, requesting that they lodge a serious protest with the Soviet Union and Mongolia.</p>
<p>[Xi'an] The Shaanxi Provincial Council, the Xi'an Chamber of Commerce, and other industrial and commercial groups such as the Flour Industry Association recently sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, urging him to take effective measures regarding the Beitashan incident.</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] The Shanxi Provincial Council solemnly telegraphed Chairman Chiang on the 14th, requesting that he take effective measures to stop the Xinjiang incident.</p>
<p>[Guiyang] The Guizhou Provincial Council, the Federation of Commerce and Industry, the Provincial Farmers' Association, the Provincial Education Association, the Provincial Association of Chinese Physicians, the Provincial Fisheries Association Federation, the Guizhou Labor Welfare Association, the Guiyang City Federation of Trade Unions, and various vocational groups telegraphed Chairman Chiang of the National Government, requesting the withdrawal of Mongolian troops and compensation for losses due to the invasion of the Xinjiang border by Mongolian troops.</p>
<p>[Lanzhou] The Gansu Provincial Council, the 7th District Highway Trade Union, and the Lanzhou University Student Union have all convened emergency meetings successively regarding the Xinjiang incident, recognizing it as a re-enactment of the September 18th Incident.</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Comments on Xinjiang Incident, Sympathizing with Our Protest to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] Reports of the invasion of Xinjiang by Outer Mongolian troops have not yet caused a reaction from officials here. The State Department is currently awaiting detailed reports and remains extremely silent. The Washington Star's editorial this afternoon stated: "We have good reason to believe (as Nanjing apparently believes) that the Soviet Union must bear at least some responsibility for the Outer Mongolian invasion of Xinjiang. China's protest to the Soviet Union is not without reason. The action of that foreign business may, in imagination, be an action by the Kremlin to add to the difficulties of the Chinese government while it is fully dealing with the Communist Party. The Soviet explanation will be of concern and expectation to people all over the world.</p>
<h3>China is Suffering; America Should Not Lose Concern, Says Former Deputy Director of UNRRA China</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 14th] Former Deputy Director of the UNRRA China Office, Fowler, stated in a speech to the United China Relief last week: Although China is currently suffering from bloodshed and pain, Americans must not lose concern for it because of the various difficulties caused by China's transition from a feudal state to a modern industrial society. The most beneficial thing for China is to support various educational programs. Ambassador Stuart should also say this. The greatest contribution of UNRRA in China was its training work. Fowler expressed appreciation for the principle of the United China Relief's equal treatment of relief in both the Communist and National areas, and admired Ms. Soong Ching-ling's enthusiasm for charitable work.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Remains Silent; Does Not Express Opinion on Xinjiang Incident</h3>
<p>[Huadong News Agency] Wang Shijie came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and met with a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, answering questions about the Xinjiang incident. He said: "Regarding the Xinjiang incident, I am in a diplomatic position and am not in a position to express any opinions. However, one thing I can tell you is that the government has formally raised a serious issue through diplomatic channels."</p>
<h3>Wei Lihuang Inspects American Airfield in Berlin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th] General Wei Lihuang visited the US Air Force Base in Tempelhof today. It is reported that the base is the largest airfield in Berlin. General Wei and others presented a large wreath to the Soviet Fallen Soldiers Monument yesterday morning. A senior Soviet official told the Central News Agency reporter that the Soviet authorities are deeply grateful for Wei's friendly actions.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Hosted Banquet for Representatives of Ando Tibetan Region Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Yang Fuxing, head of the delegation of representatives from the 48 banners and 100 temples of Gannan Zhuoni in the Ando Tibetan region, and five other representatives, met with Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng and Central Committee member Chen Guofu on the 15th.

<h3>America Needs China's Tungsten Production; Government Stockpiling Policy Creates Tungsten Shortage</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 14th] According to people in the tungsten industry here, China is a major global supplier of tungsten ore, so it is very easy to regain the American market, because the United States is the country with the largest industrial use of tungsten. At the same time, recent reports have further confirmed this statement, because American industry is facing a serious tungsten shortage due to the government's stockpiling policy and lack of imports. The lack of tungsten in the United States has caused a sharp increase in tungsten ore prices, which have risen from US$23 per 20-pound unit to US$32 in the past six months (an increase of about 30%). Before the war, tungsten ore supplies from China, Burma, and Malaya accounted for 65% of the world's total. Since then, tungsten production has been concentrated in the United States and South American countries such as Bolivia, Brazil, and Mexico. China's tungsten exports have been greatly hampered by its efforts in warfare and transportation inconvenience. Recently, costs have risen sharply, and the American tungsten industry has adopted a tariff barrier system, so people in China's tungsten industry feel that it is impossible to make a profit from mining tungsten for export. Tungsten is resistant to heat and acid, so it is an important metal in both wartime and peacetime. In industry, tungsten is used to manufacture high-speed machine steel, tungsten filaments, and various power chemical products. In military terms, tungsten is used to manufacture armor plates and armor-piercing projectiles, so it is an important metal in military terms. The reporter learned from authoritative sources that the US government has stockpiled large quantities of tungsten ore seedlings and tin, and this inventory is kept for emergency use and is currently under the control of the Army and Navy Munitions Bureau. It is said that the US government intends to continue to store this important metal for the next five years, and they refuse to supply any inventory for commercial use. According to tungsten industry estimates, the United States consumed approximately 2.5 million pounds of tungsten in the first three months of this year. The current supply of tin in the American market is only enough for four Danes. The large-scale application of tungsten by American industry has created a huge gap between the supply and demand of tin. People in the tungsten industry here believe that if China's tungsten mines can adopt new methods and be sold at international prices, it can be a major resource for obtaining US dollars.</p>
<h3>Universal Suffrage is Determined to be Held as Scheduled; CCP Seems to Have No Intention of Reconciliation; Zhang Junmai Talks about the Situation after Returning to Shanghai from Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Zhang Junmai returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday and told reporters: "Regarding the unified interpretation of the constitution, it is being drafted by designated personnel. As for the determination of the peace plan, the National Affairs Conference's peace resolution will be passed and accepted at the next State Council meeting. The prerequisite for restoring transportation in the past three-party joint governance policy will be omitted, that is, the restoration of peace talks is unconditional. As long as the CCP is willing to talk, it can be started at any time. In addition, when I was in Beijing this time, I also contacted people about participating in the universal suffrage. Currently, various preparatory work, such as population surveys and printing election tickets, are underway. The government has decided to implement it in accordance with the National Assembly resolution and does not intend to postpone it. Negotiations on the ratio of the number of representatives from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party to the government are also underway. If we want all parties to jointly conduct elections, we should first agree on the ratio of representatives." After Zhang reported, reporters asked about the development of the situation, and he replied separately as follows: (1) The understanding of the situation of the Xinjiang incident is not yet sufficient, and it is probably a co-issue between Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang Province.</p>
<p>Complex Internal Communist Army; Tense Situation in Northeast</p>
<p>(2) There are Korean Communists and Japanese prisoners of war participating in the Communist offensive in Northeast China, and the situation is very serious. The Communist Party has an international character, so the seriousness did not start today. (3) Regarding the protection of human rights, I wrote to Director Zhang because of Fan Puji's arrest. In fact, Fan was not arrested, but only stayed on a farm outside Chengdu. Restoring freedom is only a matter of time. Some of the students and reporters arrested in various places have been punished, and the reporters are being rescued by the Information Bureau. The government has decided to temporarily suspend these emergency measures. (4) The current economic policy should focus on increasing production, and then foreign exchange can be obtained through exports. Although the civil war is ongoing, the area south of the Yangtze River is not affected by the Wu disaster and can still strive to increase production, especially agriculture. For example, the government is quite confident in improving cotton production. Zhang said that</p>
<p>It is still difficult to achieve peace at present, because the</p>
<p>Strong military, even if it agrees to the two prerequisites it requested in the past, it may not be able to turn hostility into friendship. Today, the CCP may not be satisfied with the nationalization of the army in the military reorganization plan.</p>

<p>Sun Yat-sen's Teachings Shine Like the Sun and Stars</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen established this school to rebuild the foundation of the revolution, establish an army with revolutionary spirit, remove revolutionary obstacles, and complete the revolutionary cause, so that the Three Principles of the People can be fully realized to save China from its peril. His instructions at the opening ceremony of the school stated: First, establish revolutionary aspirations and emulate the actions of the martyrs; second, revolution must first revolutionize the heart, and the bad thoughts, habits, and nature of the past must be fundamentally eradicated, breaking down selfish and self-interested ideas, and fighting wholeheartedly for the country; third, revolutionary soldiers should have concrete and profound knowledge, understand revolutionary principles, and be able to face death as if returning home, displaying the spirit of one against a hundred. Finally, he solemnly stated: The revolutionary cause is to save the country and the people. Sun Yat-sen's profound and clear teachings are entrusted to the spirit of Whampoa. Up to the 23rd anniversary today, they still shine like the sun and stars and remain enduring.</p>
<p>Revolutionary Obstacles Await Clearing</p>
<p>Since the pacification of the East River, the Northern Expedition, the suppression of warlords, and the unification of China, up to the eight years of sacred and arduous resistance against Japan, countless of our past students have shed their blood on the battlefields and sacrificed themselves for the country, amounting to tens of thousands. Now, two years after the victory of the War of Resistance, the foundations of the country are precarious, the accumulated worries are piling up, and the suffering of the people is almost back to the time of the school's opening in 1924. The perilousness of the revolutionary environment, the arrogance of counter-revolutionary forces, the obscurantism of the Three Principles, and the widespread dispersal and bewilderment of people's hearts are even worse than they were then. As the saying goes, "If the way rises one foot, the demons rise ten." And, "Hardships and difficulties make jade." As the revolution reaches its final success, the obstacles to the revolutionary future, which await our destruction and clearing, will inevitably appear more stubborn and intense. Therefore, today and in the days to come, is the time for our final struggle, which is also the key to the success or failure of the revolution, the survival or demise of the country, and the rise or fall of the nation. Our graduates of past years, whether fighting bravely on the front lines or dedicating themselves to the work of building the army and the nation, on this important anniversary, must know that the country's worries, the revolution's difficulties, the devastation of our villages, and the suffering of our compatriots are all our own greatest shame. Whether the glory of Whampoa's history can be carried forward, whether the fruits of the victory of the War of Resistance can be maintained, and whether the spirits of the martyrs underground can rest in peace, are all the inescapable responsibilities of our hundred thousand students.</p>
<p>Cooperate Unanimously and Strive for Self-Improvement</p>
<p>Our school's motto is "Fraternity, Integrity, and Sincerity." Only with the spirit of unanimous cooperation and shared honor and disgrace can we speak of fraternity; only with the virtue of continuous self-improvement and unwavering honesty can we speak of integrity and sincerity. The main points that our students should strive to emulate have already been explained in detail by me on the 20th anniversary of the school's founding. What I want to emphasize to all my students today is our founder Sun Yat-sen's most essential teaching: "Establish revolutionary aspirations and emulate the actions of the martyrs." Every student must deeply reflect on whether our daily thoughts, lives, and actions are worthy of the revolutionary party's unwavering independence, selfless dedication, sacrifice for righteousness, and the spirit of overcoming setbacks. Whether our conduct, treatment of others, fighting, and governance can emulate the revolutionary martyrs and deceased students' fearlessness of difficulty, avoidance of danger, resoluteness, bravery, and having a "me against the enemy" attitude.</p>
<p>Carry on the Past and Open up the Future</p>
<p>Our cause depends on us to continue, the nation's peril depends on us to save, the party's disgrace depends on us to wash away, and the suffering of our compatriots depends on us to alleviate. Our position today is as loyal ministers and abandoned children. Our responsibility today is to carry on the past and open up the future. If we today do not succeed in the final struggle, we will be guilty of failing Sun Yat-sen, failing the glorious martyrs, failing the deceased students, failing the country and the nation, and deserving eternal condemnation. Time is running out, and where there's a will, there's a way. How can we encourage and save ourselves, follow the blood-stained footsteps of the martyrs, and clear the thorns to reach the goal of final success? Let all students think deeply, reflect profoundly, and put it into practice.</p>

<h3>The Nation Should Be Deeply Vigilant About Opening Trade with Japan; General Opinion of Various Circles in Shanghai</h3>
<p>(This City News) The U.S. State Department announced that the U.S. will open Japan's foreign trade posts in mid-August this year. People from all walks of life here attach great importance to this. The opinions of various parties are collected and reported as follows: According to Xu Jiyun, the current chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Since General MacArthur took control of Japan, the results have been remarkable. China, affected by unstable conditions, is facing considerable obstacles in its reconstruction and development. Moreover, the problem of domestic raw material supply has not been fully resolved, and production is declining. In the future, with Japanese goods pouring in, the future of China's industry will face even greater crises. Xu continued: I was a student in Japan after the Sino-Japanese War and lived in Japan for a long time, so I know the Japanese national character better. Generally speaking, they are outwardly humble and inwardly treacherous, seemingly respectful but cunning in their hearts. Although Japan has been defeated, under the support of General MacArthur, its recovery ability is truly astonishing. We should be even more vigilant.</p>
<p>According to Liu Bingyi, Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs: Japan's pre-war trade volume was not only a giant in the Far East, but also occupied an important position in the world. A review of the annual statistical tables of our country's customs and the world trade books will make this clear. China's current international trade is sluggish, and the trade deficit cannot be reduced for the time being. This has become an obvious fact. With the addition of this powerful competitor, the future is even more unthinkable. Although it feels too early to talk about Japan's restoration of foreign trade at this time, China's industrial and commercial circles must prepare in advance.</p>
<p>According to Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the Textile Building Company: Although Japan currently has only 2.5 million spindles and produces 70,000 bales of yarn per month, it is impossible to dump large quantities abroad for the time being. However, Japan must first compete for the Nanyang market. This will inevitably hit our country's efforts to seek the southern transport of yarn and cloth. However, the potential for Japanese recovery is extremely strong. If our country does not take measures to surpass it in advance, we will inevitably fall behind in the future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Importers and Exporters Struggle on the Brink of Death</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] It is estimated that as many as 7,000 Japanese importers and exporters are currently struggling on the brink of death. This is because General MacArthur's statement regarding the resumption of Japanese foreign trade assured Allied merchants that they could have unlimited contact with Japanese producers and provide these merchants with all possible conveniences in Japan. Japanese importers and exporters are afraid that once Allied traders enter Japan, they will seize the position of agents for Japanese importers and exporters. These unhappy importers and exporters told a reporter from the Central News Agency that they have no chance to compete with Allied merchants who have received MacArthur's promise to obtain all possible conveniences. On the other hand, Japanese exporters face the insurmountable difficulty of a lack of transportation, as well as the controls of the Allied General Headquarters' foreign trade organizations. Japanese exporters pointed out that Allied traders, with their access to transportation, have easier access to Japanese producers than Japanese exporters do. In addition, the Allied General Headquarters' foreign trade organizations, which control Japanese trade, will be more accommodating to Allied traders while ignoring Japanese exporters. Japanese importers and exporters fear that the era of their being refused to act as agents may be coming to an end.</p>

<h3>Due to Lack of Raw Materials and Sluggish Sales, Japan's Silk and Yarn Production Has Sharply Decreased, Reaching Only 30% of Pre-War Levels</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Japan's silk and rayon industries, along with the cotton and fishing industries, will be sources of national income. However, the rayon industry, like the cotton industry, is also facing obstacles, and sales are sluggish due to the rise of American-made nylon. Japan's raw silk industry is also slowly recovering to the world market. From December of last year to March of this year, Japan exported a total of 84,400 bales of raw silk (132 pounds per bale) to the United States, but only 20,000 bales have been sold. Japanese sources say that they will export 130,000 bales this year, but by mid-April, only over 2,000 bales have been exported. Japan's current raw silk production is 8,500 bales per month. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, there are 876,500 silkworm farmers in Japan, with a total of 186,250 chō of mulberry fields. Last year, they produced a total of 32.49 million grams of silkworm eggs, and the silkworm contribution reached 18.21 million guan (one guan equals 8.28 pounds). According to American silk experts, no other industry in the Japanese economy can replace sericulture. Japan's current production of rayon and cotton yarn is only 30% of pre-war levels. Currently, the production of rayon is less than one million pounds, and the monthly production of cotton yarn is only slightly less than two million pounds.</p>

<h3>Seeking Stability Through Economic Revival</h3>
<p>A Dedicatory Speech at the Opening of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East</p>
<p>The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East solemnly opened in Shanghai this morning. Representatives from ten countries, including China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Thailand, India, and Australia, have jointly arrived in Shanghai. Mr. Woven, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Social and Economic Council, came to Shanghai from the United States specifically to preside over the meeting. The Chinese authorities, in recognition of the importance of this meeting, also had Foreign Minister Wang personally preside over the opening ceremony and deliver a speech on behalf of President Chiang. This is the first international conference convened in the Far East after the war. Its mission is to study the economic losses suffered by various countries in the Far East during the war, to provide suggestions on how to restore the economic situation of each country, and to establish normal economic relations between countries. However, its effect will not be limited to the economic aspect alone, and it will inevitably have a very important impact on politics as well. In today's world, where politics and economics are inseparable, political stability often depends on the resolution of economic problems; similarly, economic stability also depends on enlightened and progressive politics. Therefore, the establishment of the Economic Commission for the Far East in Shanghai this morning is of great significance, both in terms of the lofty ideals of the United Nations organization and in terms of the future of economic revival in the Far East. We feel particularly excited and earnestly expectant regarding the meeting of this committee, and we should first express our sincere welcome to the representatives of various countries who have come to Shanghai from afar.</p>
<p>Modern international warfare is truly a catastrophe for mankind. In particular, the Second World War caused even deeper suffering to humanity. The Sino-Japanese War was the prelude to the Second World War, so Asia suffered from the poison of war not only for a longer period than Europe, but also suffered greater losses than Europe. President Truman has proposed a plan to provide economic assistance to European countries in order to restore the economic situation of various European countries and prevent the collapse of the social economy of various European countries. However, the economic assistance plan for Asian countries has not yet been discussed; therefore, the people of Asian countries feel even more urgent about the establishment of the Economic Commission for the Far East. As far as China is concerned, from the July 7th Incident to the end of the victory in the War of Resistance, the losses of public and private materials are estimated to be no less than three hundred billion US dollars, not including the deaths and injuries of soldiers and civilians and the expenditure of national military expenses. Moreover, after suffering great trauma, China is now preparing to engage in post-war economic revival work, so in the future, whether in terms of materials or economics, the need for external assistance is self-evident. Requesting priority compensation from Japan is certainly a viable approach, and our delegation to Japan has also frankly stated that "China hopes to extract compensation from Japan's current production, and China needs to obtain immediately applicable materials from Japan." However, Japan's compensation capacity is ultimately limited and may not be able to compensate for all of China's losses, and the opinions of various countries on this Japanese compensation issue are divergent and have not yet touched the core of the issue. It is expected that the peace treaty with Japan is still far away. Under this situation, China cannot immediately obtain compensation from Japan, so naturally it can only hope that the United Nations Social and Economic Council can take effective measures to prevent China's social economy from falling into a state of collapse. At present, China's social economy is fraught with dangers and crises. On the one hand, it can be said that it is due to internal reasons, but on the other hand, it must be said that it is the result of the eight-year War of Resistance. The inability to eliminate the destructive forces of the Communist Party and the tendency to become bandits are fundamentally due to the fact that China's social economy has been affected by the long-term War of Resistance, creating an environment conducive to incitement by those who engage in destruction.</p>
<p>China's practical situation is indeed like this, and the same sad situation exists in other Asian countries. First, let's talk about India. Although Britain has provided a promise to transfer power to India early, creating a beautiful prospect for India, in terms of social economy, due to the internal conflict between India and Pakistan, disturbances have occurred in various places, and are still ongoing. In the future, after the partition of India and Pakistan, the terrible internal conflict may intensify, and the ultimate result will also be to bankrupt India's social economy. If the United Nations cannot face reality, prevent problems before they occur, and provide all possible assistance to restore it to normal, then the future of the Indian economy is not entirely optimistic. The next is Indonesia, which, after the end of the war, was stirred by the tide of the world, and raised the banner of national liberation, demanding independence and freedom from the Netherlands; as a result, another bloody tragedy was triggered, which has not yet been completely resolved to this day. Looking at the domestic situation, not only are families broken and fields barren, but also the East Indian Islands, which have always been known for their prosperity, are now harboring various crises in both social and economic aspects. The third is the situation in Vietnam, which is exactly the same as the actual situation in Indonesia. In addition, Myanmar, Thailand, the Philippines, etc., were all devastated by Japanese imperialism during the war, lost their vitality, and have not yet been able to restore their former appearance.</p>
<p>Just looking at the above few simple descriptions of the sad faces of the people of Asian countries after the war, we can have a simple outline. We are not afraid to alarm the ten country representatives and emphasize the crisis of the social economy of various Asian countries, but we sincerely hope that the Economic Commission for the Far East can investigate the actual situation of various Asian countries on the spot, so as to prescribe the right medicine and provide practical and effective suggestions on how to enable various Asian countries to quickly achieve economic revival, so as not to cause the inevitable economic panic after the war. As for the active aspects, how to increase the production of various Asian countries, how to improve the living standards of the people of Asia, and how to promote economic cooperation between various Asian countries, the Economic Commission must discuss a concrete and effective plan for this meeting.</p>
<p>In short, the establishment of the Economic Commission for the Far East has a very important significance, but its task is limited to providing suggestions. Whether or not the suggestions are implemented is in the hands of the countries themselves, and what Asian countries urgently need today is not empty plans, but material assistance and technical cooperation. Although the United Nations organization itself can also do its best, we ultimately hope that the United States' economic assistance plan can be expanded. At present, the United States is trying to provide economic assistance to European countries. We hope that the United States can broaden its horizons and never ignore the importance of Asian countries, and immediately extend its economic assistance plan to Asian countries. Therefore, how the United Nations organization can cooperate with the United States' economic assistance plan for Europe and Asia, so that post-war Asia can seek stability in revival, and post-war Asia can seek prosperity in stability, is the only issue facing the Economic Commission for the Far East.</p>

<h3>President Truman Signs Instrument of Ratification for the Four-Nation Peace Treaty, Emphasizes Friendship Between the American and Italian Nations, Criticizes Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria for Failing to Establish Democratic Governments</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington 14th Telegram] President Truman today signed the instrument of ratification for the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, and issued a statement at the time. His statement regarding the Italian peace treaty stated: "Some of the provisions of the treaty are not entirely in line with our wishes, and may be amended by the United Nations organization in the future as needed. The ratification of the Italian peace treaty has brought an unpleasant chapter in US-Italian relations to a close, and at the same time, Italy has entered a new era, allowing its people to look forward with hope and trust. The Italian military and civilians have made significant contributions in the task of defeating fascism and Nazism. The common sacrifices of the American and Italian nations have strengthened the friendship between the two sides. The United States is pleased to stand by Italy as the Italian people rebuild their democracy and restore their freedom in adversity. The American people are determined to continue to assist the Italian people."</p>
<p>His statement regarding the Romanian, Hungarian, and Bulgarian peace treaties stated: "I believe it is necessary to publicly express regret for the disregard of the majority of public opinion and the suppression of public opinion by the governments of these three countries. Since these three countries were liberated and reached the Yalta Agreement with the three powers, I have hoped that governments truly representing the people could be established in these three countries, but to this day, such governments still do not exist. However, for the benefit of the people of Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, the state of war that has lasted for more than five years between the United States and these three countries must be ended. The establishment of peace means that all occupying forces in various countries (except for the Soviet troops maintaining the transportation lines to Austria) will be withdrawn from their respective countries, and the control committees established under the armistice agreement will also be terminated."</p>
<p>[United Press Washington 14th Telegram] President Truman criticized the governments of Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria for violating the public opinion of their own countries when signing the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria on the 14th. At the same time, he praised the Italian people and hoped that they would become a "strong, free, and democratic Italy." Truman's harsh criticism of the governments of the three Balkan countries came after US officials were planning ways to stop Soviet political aggression in Eastern Europe. US officials have changed their original intention of immediately appealing to the United Nations about the Hungarian coup, because if the Soviet Union is determined to prevent it, the United Nations and the United States will in fact be unable to do anything about the Soviet Union's actions in Hungary. US officials now feel that the most appropriate way is to first allow the treaty to take effect, and then wait and see the changes in Hungary and other places. According to authoritative sources: The United States has not yet formulated a plan for what actions to take in the Balkans in the future. At the same time, it is expected that the Soviet Union will reject the US request for the three powers to investigate Hungary.</p>
<h3>Within Ninety Days of the Peace Treaty with Italy Taking Effect, All British Troops Will Withdraw; The Two Countries Sign an Agreement in Rome</h3>
<p>[Reuters Rome 14th Telegram] The United Kingdom and Italy have recently signed an agreement at the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, each in a sovereign capacity, to facilitate the withdrawal of British troops and to determine the status of British troops in Italy within ninety days of the Italian peace treaty taking effect. The agreement consists of four letters, including fourteen points, which will be published by the British government in the form of a white paper, so it cannot be announced at this time. However, it is learned that the provisions include: British troops will pass through Italian territory to Venice Giulia Province, British troops will continue to use empty houses in Italy, but British troops will engage in rapid withdrawal within ninety days. British military personnel are subject to the jurisdiction of British courts, and the Italian authorities will provide British troops with expenses, etc. It is known that the content of this agreement will lead the US authorities to anticipate that a similar agreement will also be established between the US and Italy.</p>
<p>[United Press Rome 14th Telegram] According to a British Embassy spokesman, there are currently only about 35,000 British troops stationed in Italy, the most being 500,000 during the war against Germany. British Ambassador Sir Charles signed the agreement on behalf of the British government and said that once British troops are completely withdrawn, the last symbol of the armistice period will be eliminated. Italian Foreign Minister Sforza also declared after signing that this agreement can symbolize the future relationship of British-Italian understanding.</p>
<h3>Italian General Election Decided to Be Held Next Spring</h3>

<h3>Vatican Newspaper Says Conflict Can Be Avoided</h3>
<p>[United Press Vatican City 14th Telegram] The Vatican newspaper "L'Osservatore Romano" said in an editorial today that the conflict between communism and Western democracy is not inevitable, and there is plenty of room in the world to accommodate more than one way of life. What is especially important is that national theories must recognize that all ideals can coexist in the world. They must recognize this point, otherwise they will repeat "you die or I live."</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister's Speech Supports the United Nations Organization; The World Should Understand Its Importance</h3>
<p>[Reuters Gilham Villa near Canterbury, England 14th Telegram] Prime Minister Attlee said in a speech today at a conference supporting the "United Nations Organization Association" that any future war is not only a matter of life and death for individuals, but also a matter of life and death for the entire culture. The Prime Minister asked, "Some people think that the world can continue to move forward in its old way, and once a crisis occurs, the United Nations organization can prevent the tragedy from happening. I do not believe that this is the way we can complete the establishment of the United Nations organization. We want to make the world recognize this United Nations organization, which is no less important than their own government, so everyone must use their reason to understand the problems handled by the United Nations organization."</p>
<h3>There Is Talk of President Truman Visiting Brazil</h3>
<p>[French News Agency Brazilian Capital 14th Telegram] The "World Daily News" here recently reported that President Truman will come to Brazil for a visit in late October or early November.</p>
<h3>President Truman Will Veto the Income Tax Reduction Bill</h3>
<p>[French News Agency Washington 14th Telegram] Regarding the fact that the US Senate passed a financial bill under Republican influence, stipulating that income tax should be reduced, it was recently learned from responsible sources that President Truman will exercise his veto power before the evening of the 16th, so that the US treasury will not be depleted due to the reduction of income tax, and at the same time, so that President Truman's proposed economic assistance plan for Europe will not be affected. According to well-informed sources: When President Truman announces the veto of the bill, he will attach a statement, stating that the United States has a large-scale need to assist Europe and Asia.</p>
<h3>US Republicans Demand Greater Voice</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 14th Telegram] Secretary of State Marshall faced a problem today, namely the Republican Party's demand for a greater voice in reviewing US foreign policy, especially its plan to revitalize Europe with billions of dollars. Senate Speaker Vandenberg demanded the rapid organization of a special bipartisan advisory committee. There is considerable disagreement in Congress on this matter. Some Republican senators have expressed their doubts about the United States spending money abroad again. Republican Policy Committee Chairman Taft recently said that he will issue a statement on foreign aid programs and will convene a special meeting of the Economic Committee of the two houses on the 23rd to discuss all matters related to foreign spending. Marshall and his staff have not reacted to Vandenberg's plan, but even if they object, they know that it is quite difficult to deal with, because Vandenberg is the backbone of planning US foreign policy, especially in planning anything that "requires Congressional action". Moreover, the economic revitalization plan for Europe not only requires Congressional approval, but also requires the appropriation of billions of dollars. If Vandenberg's "price" for organizing a bipartisan advisory committee is cooperation with the economic revitalization plan for Europe, Marshall will likely support it.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Rejects US Proposal, Opposes Three-Nation Joint Investigation of Hungarian Coup</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper] London 15th Broadcast: The Soviet government has rejected Britain's statement on the Hungarian coup, denouncing it as a new attempt by Britain to interfere in Hungarian internal affairs. The Soviet reply was published by the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>Nagy Arrives in the United States and Makes a Statement</h3>
<p>[Reuters New York 15th Telegram] Former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy arrived at LaGuardia Airport from Geneva today with his family. In the airport reception room, a reporter asked what measures he expected the three powers to take regarding the situation in Hungary. He replied that the three powers had already won the victory in the war, which is an undeniable fact, but all major countries hope that after the signing of the peace treaty, no one will threaten the survival of their independent countries again. Strong countries should pay close attention to the situation in Southeast Europe. The political trends there have definitely threatened the safety, peace, and freedom of small countries, so when strong countries discover that the sovereignty of small countries has been threatened, they should immediately conduct an investigation. When asked how long he planned to stay in the United States, he replied that he could not answer at this time. He said that the main purpose of his visit to the United States was to make the United States and the world understand the situation in Hungary.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Tempts Austria to Join the Balkan Group; Austrian Foreign Minister Criticizes the Communist Party</h3>
<p>[United Press London 14th Telegram] According to a Paris telegram: Under the instigation of the Soviet Union, the Danube countries will convene a meeting in the capital of Romania, and Austria has also been invited, attempting to tempt it to join the brewing Balkan group.</p>
<p>[French News Agency Vienna 14th Telegram] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber delivered a radio speech tonight, fiercely criticizing the Communist Party's attempt to subject Austria to the rule of a minority faction, and said that Austria has become the nerve center of the world's conscience. Attempting to place Austria under the rule of a minority faction is also attempting to destroy the system of international cooperation. World peace requires us to crush all attempts to implement dictatorship. We must not be subdued by force. Austrian Communist Party leader Fischer studied in the Soviet Union for many years and demanded close relations with the Soviet Union, which is unreasonable. In short, a free Austria will be born sooner than we expected.</p>
<h3>British Commonwealth Association Advocates Convening a Three-Power Summit to Solve the Problem of Atomic Energy Control</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London 15th Broadcast: The British Commonwealth Association, newly established and led by Churchill, issued a public letter today requesting Prime Minister Attlee to hold a summit with President Truman and Stalin as soon as possible to formulate a plan for atomic energy control. It is said that since the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission has been unable to reach an agreement on the issue of atomic energy control, direct negotiations between the three powers seem necessary. Attlee's reaction to this proposal is not yet known.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Issue of European Economic Cooperation: France Submits Memorandum to the United States; French Viewpoints Are Quite Similar to Marshall's</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] A person in charge here told an Agence France-Presse reporter today that the French Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Bonnet, submitted the French government's memorandum on economic cooperation among European countries to U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall yesterday. The French viewpoints are similar to those recently expressed by Secretary Marshall at Harvard University, it is said.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] Regarding the U.S. economic aid plan for Europe, after Secretary of State Marshall announced that the Soviet Union was also included, some people here were relieved. This is because they had initially expected that the Soviet Union would be excluded.</p>
<p>Britain and France Intensify Consultations on the U.S. Aid to Europe Plan</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] Mr. Alphand, Director of Economic Affairs of the French Foreign Ministry, will come to London early next week to discuss the aid to Europe plan proposed by Secretary of State Marshall with British economic experts. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will also go to Paris to meet with French Foreign Minister Bidault. Thus, the economic cooperation between Britain and France announced by Foreign Secretary Bevin will enter an active stage. Britain and France had already begun consultations on the U.S. economic aid plan for Europe a week ago, and now both sides will jointly consider the best methods to adapt to the U.S. aid to Europe plan. Secretary of State Marshall should explain his aid plan in more detail, so that European countries can use this as a basis to formulate a joint statement on their needs. However, the problem that needs to be solved now is whether to contact the United States through various European economic and social institutions already established in Geneva, or whether the relevant European countries should negotiate directly with the United States. In addition, should the U.S. aid to Europe plan be a general aid plan limited to three or four years, or a plan that is easier to implement and only supplies urgent needs? A choice must also be made between these two.</p>

<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 14th] The first group of commissioners of the United Nations Holy Land Palestine Investigative Special Committee arrived in Palestine today. All parties speculate that the committee's recommendations are expected to promote the division of the Holy Land, rather than peace. After the arrival of the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Sandström (Swedish), he said that the committee will hold a plenary meeting on Monday, then visit Palestine to familiarize themselves with the local situation, and then begin the investigation work. Although the Arabs boycotted the committee, all commissioners will visit both Arab and Jewish areas. "Even if the Arabs do not cooperate, we still want to understand the overall situation." Regarding the fact that the Palestinian Arabs notified the United Nations institutions on Friday night, stating that the committee is composed of representatives of small countries and is easily susceptible to Jewish pressure, so the Arabs boycotted it, Mr. Sandström said that if this statement is true, then the Arabs should present their case even more.</p>

<h3>Vitamin B Added to White Rice: People in the Philippines Are Testing Its Effectiveness</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 15th] More than 100,000 residents of the Bataan Peninsula have voluntarily replaced guinea pigs to participate in a test, the results of which may have a significant impact on hundreds of millions of people in Asia who mainly eat rice. Dr. Salsbury, Director of the U.S. Public Health Office in the Philippines, has invented a method of adding Vitamin B to white rice, and plans to use the test to determine whether this method can be practically adopted on a large scale to prevent beriberi. According to Dr. Salsbury, most people in the East whiten their rice, so it does not contain vitamins. He believes that at a cost of 25 U.S. cents per person per year, sufficient beriberi-preventing ingredients can be supplied to the entire population. The taste of rice does not change when Vitamin B is added, it is said.</p>
<h3>Acheson Condemns Soviet Union for Taking Unilateral Actions in Europe and Asia</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 15th] Mr. Acheson, the recently resigned U.S. Undersecretary of State, publicly criticized today the Soviet Union for pursuing policies that are completely contrary to the major premise of international coordination and restoration. Mr. Acheson pointed out that the Soviet Union's failure to return Dalian to our country is a clear proof of this. Mr. Acheson broke away from the diplomatic euphemisms commonly used and condemned the Soviet Union for taking unilateral actions in Eastern Europe, the Far East, the Middle East, and Greece. He delivered a speech at the graduation ceremony of Wellesley College in Middle Town. When he mentioned the Far East, he stated: In the Far East, the Soviet Union dismantled industrial equipment in the Northeast, hindered the political and economic unification of Korea, and failed to fulfill its promise to return Dalian to the Chinese government as a free port. All these actions have greatly delayed economic restoration and political stability, and have largely caused the prolonged poverty, suffering, moral decline, and border chaos throughout the Far East. Mr. Acheson also severely attacked the Soviet Union for obstructing the conclusion of peace treaties with Germany and Austria. Mr. Acheson explained why the United Nations often cannot follow the principles listed in its charter, saying that it is because the Soviet Union makes the United Nations a forum for intense, useless, and endless dialects. Under this policy of the Soviet Union, the United States can do and is doing many things. Mr. Acheson gave a detailed description of the meaning of the Truman Doctrine. He said: The United States has always supported people who are fighting to maintain their own freedom. He listed examples of the United States in this regard, and said: We have spent decades of effort to assist China in its struggle against foreign conquest. Mr. Acheson's speech was formally a praise of American policy in the position of the outgoing Deputy Secretary of State. He specifically reviewed the United States' attitude toward the Soviet Union and the clear evidence of the United States' good intentions. Mr. Acheson also telegraphed to the American people upon his departure, saying: The United States should not wait for the development of extreme crises, and should not attempt to assume all the responsibilities of the world, or solve all the problems of the world, but should thoroughly support and exert its own abilities and cooperative forces to win over those who seek freedom.</p>

<h3>Post-War Japan: Widows Abound; How to Handle Them Is a Head-Scratcher</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Although Japan is committed to political and economic revival, there is a very important issue related to the future of the Japanese people that has not been considered at all, and that is the issue of wartime widows. According to a survey by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, there are 1.3 million wartime widows, while the Min Bao believes that there are 2 million. The newspaper said that on average, two out of every ten families have wartime widows, and most of them are young women. However, there are currently no concrete ideas on how to deal with them, whether to encourage them to remarry, or to live with relatives and remain widows for life.</p>

<h3>Commemorative Meeting of the 36th Anniversary of the Recovery of Shanghai; Business Guild Comrades Pay Public Tribute to the Martyrs; Suggest Establishing September 13th as a Local Memorial Day; Speaker Encourages Citizens to Maintain the Traditional Revolutionary Spirit</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] The Shanghai Business Guild Comrades Association for the Recovery of Shanghai in the Xinhai Revolution held a 36th anniversary commemorative meeting at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, and publicly paid tribute to the martyrs Chen Ying-shi, Liu Shun-qing, Zhang Pei-ru, Yu Zhi-wei, Rong Jiu-song, and Di Qi-feng, as well as the virtuous predecessors Li Ping-shu, Shen Xian-yun, Wang Yi-ting, Yu Ping-han, Lai Hui-jun, Shen Wen-bin, Su Jun-shang, Shang Shao-zeng, Zhang Gong-le, Ye Hong-ying, and the deceased comrades of the Business Guild. Wu Guo-zhen (represented by Wang Guan-qing), Pan Gong-zhan, Xuan Lu-wu, Chen Ba-shi, Wang Zhen-xiao, and guests from all walks of life attended, as well as family members of members, totaling more than 400 people. At its peak, the Business Guild had more than 6,800 members. The Xinhai revolutionary martyr Chen Ying-shi led the Business Guild to attack the Manufacturing Bureau, recovering the city. It has been 36 years since then. After 36 years of changes, the national revolutionary heroes of that year have almost all passed away, and only 241 members of the Business Guild Comrades Association are still alive today. At the beginning of the establishment of the Comrades Association last summer, there were 246 people, and 5 more have passed away in one year. Yesterday, a total of 152 people attended, most of whom were elderly. The oldest was Chairman Zhu Shao-yi, who is 76 years old, and the youngest were Ma Bo-shou and several others, who are also 53 years old.</p>
<p>Shanghai Business Guild Comrades Association for the Recovery of Shanghai Holds 36th Anniversary Commemorative Meeting; Comrades Participate Enthusiastically (Photo by This Newspaper)</p>
<p>Public Tribute at the Meeting</p>
<p>The meeting began with a tribute to the martyrs, virtuous predecessors, and deceased comrades of the Business Guild. After the tribute, Chairman Zhu Shao-yi reported, followed by speeches from the attending officials. Commander Xuan requested: Everyone here is an old comrade who attacked the Manufacturing Bureau, the creator of the most glorious page in revolutionary history. Today, after the victory of the War of Resistance, we are waiting to work hard to build the country, but there are conspirators who are trying to undermine the Republic of China, which is very distressing. Future construction still requires continued efforts. Speaker Pan then delivered a speech, roughly saying: The Shanghai Business Guild Comrades for the Recovery of Shanghai are holding a commemorative meeting in the Chen Ying-shi Martyr Memorial Hall today, which is of profound significance. Your glorious achievements in revolutionary history will be passed down to all ages and will last forever. From the Xinhai Revolution to the birth of the Republic of China, the Republic of China has always grown up in hardship and difficulty. Although the War of Resistance has been won, internal and external troubles are frequent. Lüshun and Dalian have not yet been recovered, and sovereignty is not yet complete. Recalling the hard work of the martyrs in creating the Republic of China, we should be even more vigilant. I hope that the citizens of Shanghai will maintain the traditional revolutionary spirit and work hard to build the country. Committee Member Chen Ai-shi, the younger brother of the martyr Chen Ying-shi, then rose to report the process of the recovery of Shanghai in the Xinhai Revolution, and narrated the importance of the position occupied by the recovery of Shanghai in the revolutionary process. Wang Xiao-lai, the former president of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, then spoke about the evolution of the city's Business Guild and the details of its evolution into today's voluntary police force.</p>
<p>Three Suggestions</p>
<p>At the same time, taking advantage of yesterday's meeting, the Xinhai Revolutionary Comrades Association made three suggestions to the city's party and government authorities and the Municipal Council: (1) Incorporate the fact that Shanghai was recovered in the Xinhai Revolution into the local chronicles. (2) The recovery of Shanghai was on September 13th of the lunar calendar, which is November 3rd of the solar calendar. Please designate this day as a local memorial day in order to commemorate the achievements of Chen Gong Ying-shi in recovering Shanghai, as well as the martyrs who died in this campaign, and the local gentry who assisted in this campaign, so that the people of the city will never forget. (3) The Shanghai Business Guild has more than three acres of land in Lujiabang in this city. It is willing to build a Shanghai Business Guild Memorial Monument and Memorial Hall on it, with an attached elementary school. After a few years, after all the Business Guild comrades have passed away, there will still be relics left in this city, and the descendants of thousands of comrades will see the objects and think of people, and encourage their actions. After the meeting, there was a rehearsal of a Peking opera, with wonderful programs such as Qian Hua-fo's special addition of an official. After the play, there was a dinner, and the meeting did not break up until around 10:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>First Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of the National Products Manufacturers Association</h3>

<h3>Madame Chiang Flies Back to Nanjing</h3>

<h3>Actively Auditing Business Income Tax; Audit Standards Increased as Much as Possible; Only Three Percent of Shanghai Units Should Be Audited</h3>
<p>In order to implement the principle of rectifying tax revenue under the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, the Ministry of Finance is actively auditing last year's business income tax and selectively conducting audits. However, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce believes that the procedures are cumbersome and has requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt account verification and continue to adopt simplified tax collection methods. A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance stated that, according to the regulations of the Business Income Tax Collection Measures, Shanghai City belongs to the account verification tax area, and the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau is actively carrying out account verification work, which is being handled by order and in accordance with the principle of fair calculation.</p>
<p>Recently, in consideration of the convenience of business people in practice, the audit standards have been increased as much as possible. Except for those in each industry whose declared total annual turnover is more than 400 million yuan, or whose profit is more than 200 million yuan, audits will still be conducted. The rest will be handled in accordance with the standard tax calculation method. The so-called standard tax calculation is based on the declared income, randomly inspecting the account records of each industry, and comparing 5% to 10% of the most complete and accurate merchants. In each industry, the amount of turnover is also considered, and a lottery method is used to select the numbers for inspection. Then, based on the results of the inspection, the standard ratio is calculated, and then the tax amount is assessed by household. According to this standard, among the more than 50,000 industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai, those that should be audited, calculated based on sales, account for about 1,600 units. The financial industry, which reports its income, has more than 40 units. In total, the number of units that should be audited accounts for just under 3% of the entire city of Shanghai, including many foreign companies. By doing so, both fairness and convenience can be taken into account. The Ministry has already instructed the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau to follow and comply with it carefully, and strictly prevent harassment, so that both national interests and the welfare of the people can be taken into account. The spokesman also stated that the simplified tax collection method that was once piloted in the past involved trade associations determining the amount and apportioning it among the same trade, which was actually equivalent to apportionment and was not in line with the basic system of income tax, so it should not be adopted. In the future, the Ministry of Finance will continue to devote itself to the establishment of a good and reasonable tax system, and hopes that the business people across the country will cooperate sincerely and jointly witness its success. In addition, foreign companies in Shanghai, such as Mobil Oil, have not only declared their income for the previous year and paid income tax, but have also recently estimated their profits for January to April this year and prepaid a large amount of income tax.</p>
<h3>Civil Aviation Corporation Passenger Plane Flies to Dihua Today</h3>

<h3>To Prevent Infectious Diseases as Much as Possible, You Can Request DDT Spraying</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] According to a spokesman for the Epidemic Prevention Committee, spring epidemics such as smallpox and meningitis have gradually decreased so far. Summer infectious diseases such as cholera have not yet been discovered, and preventive work is being actively promoted at present. To date, 560,000 people in the city have been vaccinated. For DDT spraying, the total amount of pure powder allocated by the head office is about 12 tons, and the content of 10% is about 30 tons, but because of the difficulty in purchasing kerosene, there is not much powder in stock, so the spraying and disinfection work is divided into three categories: (1) Shanty towns, slums, public toilets, etc. are sprayed free of charge by the Epidemic Prevention Committee. (2) If institutions, schools, and groups need to try spraying, the Epidemic Prevention Committee can provide DDT powder free of charge and provide assistance and guidance, but kerosene must be self-provided, and each gallon can spray 1,000 square feet. (3) If hotels, restaurants, large factories, etc. need to be sprayed, they can contact the Epidemic Prevention Committee and recover the cost.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Taxi Drivers' Small Account; Drivers Propose Two Demands</h3>
<p>Since the police bureau announced the crackdown on small accounts, most customers have refused to pay, and taxi drivers and workers mainly rely on alcohol income to maintain their lives, in addition to a few fixed extra wages, so everyone suddenly became panicked. The union of the industry had asked the police bureau for remedies a few days ago. As a result, Director Ruan instructed in person that before the wages of taxi drivers are adjusted, they should still be handled according to old habits, and instructed all drivers to serve with peace of mind. After discussion by all drivers, the association proposed two demands: (1) Deduct 20% of each trip's fare as a mutual assistance fund. (2) Add another 10% as a welfare fund. It has formally submitted the demands to the employer's trade association. According to the person in charge of the association, taxi drivers and workers are currently often imprisoned due to traffic congestion and accidents, and their families' lives cannot be maintained. Therefore, they requested that the employer extract 10% from the industry's income as a welfare fund.</p>

The Machinery Industry Association is a horizontal organization. All factories that use machines to manufacture national products can apply to join, so the scope is very large. Various industries such as cotton weaving, rubber, and appliances have participated. The association's work is divided into two major categories: (1) Belonging to the member factories themselves: (A) Unite as one, assist each other, gradually improve, and resist the intrusion of foreign goods. (B) Use the power of the group to recommend excellent national products to the whole country, change the mentality of the Chinese people to love and use foreign goods, and strive for foreign markets to develop overseas trade. (C) Regarding factory management and labor-capital coordination, all matters that factories should promote and reform can be discussed collectively to seek reasonable solutions.

<h3>Difficult to Sell Traitor Houses: Hard to Move People During Housing Shortage; Liquidation Office to Request Instructions</h3>
<p>The Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office has received and seized many enemy and puppet properties. A portion of these, the assets of traitors, have not yet been put up for sale. According to a person in charge of the Liquidation Office, there are many difficulties in selling the real estate of traitors. Most of the major traitors in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have been sentenced, and all valuable real estate belongs to these major traitors. Moreover, there are many properties. However, all are being managed and occupied by government officials or local prominent gentry. During this time of housing shortages, it is impossible to move them, which makes it impossible for the Liquidation Office to assess the value and conduct public auctions. Recently, high-ranking officials and gentry have expressed their willingness to purchase the houses they are managing and occupying with priority, and are unwilling for the Liquidation Office to conduct public auctions. Under these circumstances, the Liquidation Office is considering whether they can pay the full amount without delay. In short, the Liquidation Office is doing its best to overcome difficulties in handling these traitor houses. If the matter is delayed for too long, they will have to request instructions from the authorities to make firm regulations.</p>

<h3>Emergency Meeting of Military Uniform Industry</h3>
<p>The military uniform industry in this city is in a state of panic because this year's winter uniforms for various military and police agencies are suddenly being contracted out to state-owned manufacturers. An emergency meeting of the industry was held yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Most employees believe that this matter concerns the survival of the industry and should be fought for on the basis of reason. They also advocate a mass petition in Beijing until the goal of continuing to produce uniforms as before is achieved. The guild believes that at this time of national crisis, a large number of people petitioning in Beijing may cause other disputes and social misunderstandings. After a final decision, a formal petition will first be submitted to government agencies, and an appeal will be published in the newspaper.</p>

<h3>Number of Professional Criminals Exceeds Two Hundred; Thieves Account for Half; Mostly Lazy by Nature; District Court Imposes Forced Labor</h3>
<p>Those criminals who were released under the amnesty and commit crimes again are sentenced as recidivists under criminal law, or are known as habitual offenders (those who make a living by committing crimes).

However, due to soaring prices and the enlargement of the bridge surface, the original budget of more than 800 million yuan is far from sufficient and a supplementary budget is needed to complete the project. According to the person in charge of the Bureau's Structural Department, the entire repair project should be completed in two months.</p>

<h3>Dr. Qian Jianqiu Broadcasts: Shanghai Women's Movement After Victory Should Cultivate Strong Will and Exert Strength</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] This newspaper held its eleventh Sunday special broadcast yesterday at the Minsheng Radio Station, inviting Dr. Qian Jianqiu (see photo, taken by this newspaper) to broadcast, entitled "The Shanghai Women's Movement After Victory." The following is a record of her speech:</p>
<p>Unite and Seek Common Welfare</p>
<p>"The history of the women's movement is very long and the scope is very wide. Today's scope is limited to one year and ten months after the victory, and the materials are limited to the Shanghai urban area. The meaning of the term women's movement is that the majority of women unite and work together to seek the welfare of women themselves. To promote the women's movement, the first thing is to have a strict organization to generate power. Women from all walks of life in Shanghai can be divided into (1) professional women, (2) housewives, (3) working women, and (4) female youths in school. After the victory, we collectively organized the women of Shanghai and established eleven friendship associations, such as those in the education sector, the art sector, the sports sector, housewives, and college and middle school students in school. Each unit seeks common interests. As for welfare, the Shanghai Women's Welfare Association was also established to handle relief, childcare, and other welfare matters. The work of the above organizations is promoted under the guidance of the Shanghai Women's Movement Committee. This is an outline of the women's movement. Below, I want to report some actual situations:</p>
<p>College and Middle School Girls Focus on Training</p>
<p>(1) College and Middle School Girls - College and middle school girls are all intellectuals. They need to have complete training in terms of thought and character. We have held speeches, essays, and sports competitions one after another. In one year and ten months, we have tried our best. Because speeches can train speaking skills, essays can improve writing skills, and sports can temper their physique, so we attach great importance to these three competitions.</p>
<p>Professional Women Still Need to Work Hard</p>
<p>(2) Professional Women - There are quite a number of professional women in Shanghai. The largest number are in the education sector, followed by freelancers, and those in politics and business. Among freelancers, doctors are the most numerous, followed by lawyers, and accountants are fewer. As for women in politics, I feel that they are just empty names, and there are too few who can take on actual responsibilities. Taking Shanghai as an example, those above the recommended rank are as rare as phoenix feathers. Now, in name, men and women have equal rights, but it is difficult to develop freely in politics. As for those who serve in the business world, there are also very few who can stand out. Shanghai is the business center of the country, and if women cannot show their faces in the business world, other places can be imagined. There is also a gratifying phenomenon that female reporters are quite active after the victory, and their service efficiency is no less than that of men, but the number is still limited. I hope that my female comrades will work hard to expand the effectiveness of their services in various aspects of the professional world and win glory for the female world.</p>
<p>Housewives Have No Lack of Talent</p>
<p>(3) Housewives - The largest number of women in Shanghai are still housewives. Some of them are only consumers and do not produce. Many of them have received advanced education and have very good talents, but they cannot develop their ambitions upward, which makes people feel very sorry. During the period of the fall, everyone felt that the environment was special, and even after the victory, the thoughts of the general housewives have greatly improved, thinking that in the process of national construction, they can no longer live in a drunken dream and want to do some undertakings that are beneficial to the country and society. For example, when their children grow up, they can contribute part of their time and energy to social undertakings. This is a kind of alertness and a good phenomenon of self-reliance. At the same time, they are very concerned about childcare and relief, such as donations to nurseries, and they are worthy of everyone's admiration.</p>
<p>Improve the Lives of Working Women</p>
<p>(4) Working Women - Speaking of working women, there are quite a few in Shanghai. They have made great efforts for social production, but their lives are difficult. We express our great sympathy and should promote their welfare undertakings as much as possible. In other words, since they are the producers of society, we will promote their welfare undertakings even more so that they can get comfort in spirit and enjoy in material. In the past, we ran literacy classes to give them the opportunity to receive education and ran nurseries to give their children reasonable care.</p>
<p>General Women Should Correct Bad Habits</p>
<p>(5) General Women - There are also general women in Shanghai who live extravagantly, admire vanity, and their actions are not in line with the right path. We regret this and should take the responsibility to correct them. First, extravagant living should be reformed; second, the mentality of vanity should be changed; third, we must establish a foundation for economic independence so that they can develop a simple, hardworking, and hardy spirit. We want to launch a women's movement. We should make women develop a strong will, not follow the crowd, and not be assimilated by the inferior environment. Exert the power of the women's world to launch a bright future for the women's movement."</p>

<h3>Bird's-Eye View of the Domestic Film Industry: There are a Total of Five Large-Scale Production Companies in Shanghai; the Existence of War Zones Limits Many Screening Opportunities</h3>
<p>[Special Feature of This Newspaper] Watching movies is the favorite entertainment of most citizens. In this city, which is overwhelmingly occupied by Hollywood movies, let us take a bird's-eye view of the situation of the domestic film industry, which is shrinking in a corner.</p>
<p>First of all, let's talk about the production companies. In the whole of Shanghai—or even the whole of China—there are (1) Central Film Studio, (2) Cathay Film Company, (3) Former Lianhua Film Company's old department, (4) Shanghai Experimental Film Factory, and (5) Wenhua Film Company, etc. There are five companies with a larger scale, a fixed organization, and a foundation. China Electric is a semi-official institution. Luo Xuelian is the head of the factory, and it is divided into three factories below. The first factory is in Tientong'an, Zhabei, and the head of the factory is Qiu Yiwei. The second factory is on Jianguo West Road, and the head of the factory is Su Yi. The third factory is far away in Beiping, and the head of the factory is Xu Angqian. Cathay is a purely commercial film company. The old cabinet is Liu Zhonghao. It has strong capital and a large number of people. It produces the most and the fastest, but it inevitably becomes bad. The base of production is in Damuqiao. The organization of the old department of Lianhua is more complicated. Its names include Shanghai Film Studio and Kunlun Film Company. Like Shanghai Experimental Film Factory, it is hosted by more serious artists. The person in charge of the former is Cai Chusheng, Zheng Junli, Kuang Dongshan, etc., and the latter is Fei Mu. Wenhua is smaller in planning, and the manager is Wu Xingcai. The production locations of the above three companies are concentrated in the Xujiahui Triangle. In addition, there may be a few friends who "stir up" in the film circle, suddenly rising, or blessed to the heart. Thinking that there is money to be made, they gather a group of capital, invite a few "popular" stars, borrow other people's studios, or even go as far as Hong Kong to shoot one or two movies, and put on a name of a certain production company for release. This type of "guerrilla-style" producer has no fixed organization and no fixed foundation, so there is no need to talk about it here.</p>
<p>Star Remuneration: Female is Valued More than Male</p>
<p>According to estimates by friends in the circle, Cathay's production speed in the past was an average of one movie per month, but now there is a trend of slowing down. China Electric and Wenhua average one movie every two months, while the old department of Lianhua and the Experimental Factory only have one movie a year. The speed of production depends not only on the size of capital and scale, but also on whether the attitude of production is to be group abuse or serious.</p>
<p>The most important thing in the production of a movie is the director and the actors. Since the victory, Shanghai society has been invisibly divided into two domains: "those from the mainland" and "those from the recovered area." The film industry is no exception. "Directors and actors from the mainland" are mostly concentrated in China Electric, such as Zhang Junxiang, Chen Liting, Zhao Dan, Bai Yang, Qin Yi, etc., "those in the recovered area" are included by Cathay, etc., such as Yang Xiaozhong, Xu Xinfu, Li Pingqian, Chen Yanyan, Liu Qiong, Gu Lanjun, Li Lihua, Yan Jun, etc. There is another group that has transferred from the drama world, such as Zuo Lin, Shi Hui, Zhang Fa, etc. However, as far as actors are concerned, most of them are not fixedly attached to a certain company or a certain film studio, but are the so-called "star special appointment system." Their remuneration is calculated by film value. The current salary for each film ranges from 10 million to 40 million yuan, depending on the "degree of popularity," and there is a difference between men and women. Female stars always earn more than male stars.</p>
<p>The Cost of a Movie is 500 Million</p>
<p>In the social and economic environment where prices continue to rise, the situation of the film industry is similar to that of the general industrial sector. It is estimated that the production cost of each movie now is about 500 million yuan in national currency. From the completion of production to the revenue from screening, it seems to make money on the surface, but when calculated at the cost of reproduction, making money becomes a loss. For this reason, some manufacturers seek speed in making films in order to make the flow of funds faster, but this inevitably leads to criticism of group production and abuse. In addition, the existence of war zones limits the opportunity for films to be screened in many places, which is also a major blow to the income of producers.</p>
<p>The Most Successful Film</p>
<p>In terms of equipment and technology, domestic films are of course far behind Hollywood films, but the most regrettable thing is the lack of film and drama themes. Someone said: If movies are compared to people, the script is like bones, the director is like the soul, and the actors are like flesh and blood. Without a good script, the director cannot perform, the actors cannot perform, and what the domestic film industry lacks most is good screenwriters. Secondly, there are too few good actors. Under the star system, an actor often makes films for more than two manufacturers at the same time, which is a loss of time and energy. As for directorial talent, there is no shortage, and there are several first-class players among them. If they can be given a good script, equipment, and talent, it is possible to create brilliant achievements.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that the most successful domestic film since the victory, which means the film with the most audiences, is "Top Secret Number One," produced by the Third Factory of China Electric, directed by Tu Guangqi, and starring Ouyang Shafei. It is said that this film is not only selling well in first-run theaters, but also in second- and third-run theaters for a long time.</p>
<p>If Cooperating with Excellent Script Equipment, It May Not Be Possible to Create Brilliant Achievements</p>

<h3>Funding Adjusted for All Colleges and Universities: To Be Distributed on Schedule Starting in July; the Amounts for May and June Have Been Ordered by the National Treasury to Be Issued by Central Banks in Various Places</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Since the government adjusted the salaries of public school employees, the adjusted additional funding for all national colleges and universities should be allocated starting in May. The Beijing and Shanghai areas are close to the capital and have been issued separately according to the additional amounts. Due to the remote locations of various places, the official documents were forwarded and the payment orders arrived late, which affected the faculty and staff of the colleges and universities and they could not receive the additional salaries for May on time. A few days ago, the colleges and universities in Beiping held a meeting on this matter and decided to telegraph the relevant authorities to allocate the additional funding for May as soon as possible. It is heard that the Ministry of Education has long paid attention to this and submitted a request to the Executive Yuan in mid-May to notify the National Treasury of the Ministry of Finance of the payment order for the funds added to the adjustment of various colleges and universities in May as soon as possible, and to order the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank to separately notify the National Treasury of the branch offices in various places to issue the funds as soon as possible, and also to send a letter to the National Treasury of the Ministry of Finance to grant prompt handling. Recently, the National Treasury has replied to the Ministry of Education, generally stating that the adjusted additional amounts for May and June have been transferred to the National Treasury Bureau together, and the National Treasury of the Central Bank has been notified separately to issue them in various places, and the additional funding from July to December is also planned to be sent to the National Treasury in various places so that they can be paid on schedule. It is learned that the additional funding for May for various colleges and universities can be received from the local National Treasury, and the funding for June can also be withdrawn on time. From July onwards, the National Treasury can issue the funds on schedule.</p>

<h3>Peiping University of Technology Launches Campaign to Restore School</h3>
<p>Alumni in Peiping and Shanghai Hosted Reporters Yesterday</p>
<p>[Beiping, This Newspaper, 15th] The Alumni Association of Peiping University of Technology hosted reporters today to report on their petition to the Ministry of Education, requesting that Peiping University of Technology be renamed "National Peiping University of Technology" or "National Peiping Institute of Technology."</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in this city] Alumni associations of National Peiping University of Technology in various places have written to request the restoration of the school and oppose its merger into Peiyang University. They have successively sent representatives to Shanghai to gather and discuss petitioning the Ministry of Education in Nanjing. The Shanghai branch of the Alumni Association hosted reporters from this city at the YMCA at 6 PM yesterday, where they reported on the matter. According to the association's chairman, Hu Juewen, the school was founded in the 29th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty as the Imperial Higher Industrial School, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the Beijing Industrial Vocational School, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education. In the thirteenth year, it was renamed National Beijing University of Technology. In the seventeenth year, the Ministry of Education implemented the university district system, merging various national colleges and universities in Peiping into Peiping University, and the school was renamed the First Engineering College of Peiping University. In the nineteenth year, it was renamed the Engineering College of Peiping University. When the War of Resistance broke out in the twenty-sixth year, faculty and students moved west, becoming part of the Northwest United University and the Northwest Institute of Technology. After the victory, various schools were restored one after another, but the Ministry of Education alone proposed the merger of Peiping University of Technology into Peiyang University of Technology. The students of the school felt dissatisfied and decided to take the following steps: (1) National Peiping University of Technology or National Peiping Institute of Technology has its reasons for existing, and its restoration must be vowed. A document will be prepared and first requested from the Ministry of Education. (2) Send representatives to personally meet with Minister Zhu to request restoration starting from the next semester and to first issue an order to prevent Peiyang from merging the alma mater. (3) If the second request is not approved by the Ministry of Education, it will be made public to the society and appealed to the relevant authorities. (4) If, during the pre-litigation process, the Ministry of Education still obstructs the restoration of the alma mater based on the deceptive reasons for the representative of the industrial school approved last year, they will go to Beijing to petition according to the original plan and will not stop until the goal of restoring the school is achieved. At the same time, a school restoration committee will be organized. Self-restoration of classes will be conducted at the original site of the alma mater. Subsequently, Dai Ruji, an old professor of the school (now a professor at Jiaotong University), listed eighteen reasons why the University of Technology should not be abolished, explaining the achievements and characteristics of the school's contribution to national industrial construction since its establishment, which is famous at home and abroad, hoping that the education authorities will carefully consider it.</p>
<h3>Former Assets of Peiyang May Be Taken Over by Peking University</h3>
<p>[Beiping, This Newspaper, 15th] Jin Wenshu, the president of Peiyang, received a letter from Mao Yisheng a few days ago, stating that the Ministry of Education has made a decision on the issue of the former assets of Peiyang, namely, to be taken over by Peking University or to establish an independent institute of technology. If the latter is adopted, the campus will have to be moved to Baoding in the future. After Jin Wenshu's negotiations in recent days, it is more likely that Peking University will take over. Hu Shi stated that although many science and engineering professors at Peking University oppose it, if opinions are consistent and the Ministry of Education issues a clear order, he can make it happen. Jin will send two letters to Nanjing, expressing that it is more appropriate for Peking University to take over.</p>

The sound of laughter came from the shed from time to time. Mayor Wu addressed the students as brothers, and the atmosphere was very cordial. Later, Mayor Wu expressed that the weather was getting warmer and hoped that the students would take care in their diet and daily life, work hard in their studies, and would be released soon. An hour later, the mayor left, and the students were reluctant to part.</p>

It was decided to establish a student aid organization, named the "Shanghai Student Union Student Aid Committee," abbreviated as "Xuelian Student Aid."

<p>In the second table tennis league, the championship match between Hualian and Youyi of the third division was held at the Jingzong Table Tennis Room in Yokohama Bridge at 8 PM the night before. Despite the rain and wind, there were still more than 200 spectators, and the atmosphere was not lonely at all. Youyi came to the court with great momentum. In the first two rounds, Zhu Jinhai and Zhu Qingji of Youyi were against Lu Wenliang and Deng Xiurong, the main players of Hualian. Lu and Deng had fierce shots, but the two Zhus resisted desperately and achieved miraculous results. Lu and Deng were temporarily caught in a hard fight. They finally reversed the situation and created a victory with their rich experience and calm attitude. It was a pity that Youyi could win but did not. Hualian's morale was even higher. Li Zhen, Yang Zhixiong, and Li Zaichun all played with ease. Youyi was defeated repeatedly. It was not until Shen Airen ascended the court that he forcefully defeated Pan Rixi, the chopping-style player of Hualian, 3-2, to pull back a game. As a result, Hualian defeated Youyi 6-1 and ranked first in the third division, while Youyi retreated to second place.</p>
<p>The finals between Jingwu and Hualian of the second division will be held at the Yokohama Bridge Central Auditorium at 8 PM tonight, with Chen Linsheng and Li Longbiao as referees. Jingwu was the overall third runner-up in the previous season. This season, they have the help of Wang Youxin, Ouyang Wei, Yang Kaiyun, and others. The strength of the lineup is no less than that of Huxing. Hualianhua is a military force composed of new and old table tennis players. In the second division, they have repeatedly defeated strong enemies and maintained their undefeated streak. With players such as Zhou Weixin, Ye Xuebin, and Gu Jinxiang, who are all veterans of more than ten years ago, and Liu Baotai and Xu Zhifu, who are excellent talents among the newcomers, they pose a serious threat to Jingwu.</p>
<p>[Third Division Rankings] (Champion) Hualian, (Runner-up) Youyi, (Third) Taishan, Band, Xinsheng Hong, (Fourth) Zhao Yi, (Fifth) Xujin, (Sixth) Nanxing, (Seventh) Lingyun. (Note) Siming B was disqualified, and its scores were not counted.</p>

<h3>After Zou Bingwen Agreed to Serve as Chairman, the Textile Adjustment Committee Began Preparations; Wu Weijing Still Resigned from Concurrent Position as Director</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Textile Industry Adjustment Committee, since its approval for establishment, has not commenced preparatory work due to internal personnel matters still being arranged. It is now learned that Zou Bingwen's appointment as chairman is largely settled. Therefore, the committee's preparatory work will begin immediately, with plans to find a suitable address and recruit staff. It is expected that the official establishment will be announced within this week once arrangements are finalized. It is reported that after its establishment, the committee will take over the business of the Textile Management Committee in handling the transportation of yarn and cloth between North and South China and re-export operations. However, the committee will consider the current situation and revise various regulations on the export of yarn and cloth to meet actual needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, Wu Weijing was originally announced to concurrently hold the position of Director of the Business Department of the committee. However, Wu stated that his original position as Deputy General Manager of China Textile Construction Corporation was already busy, and it would be especially inconvenient for a member of China Textile Construction to hold such an impartial position. Therefore, he personally visited Zou Bingwen's residence yesterday to firmly tender his resignation. It is said that Zou still persuaded Wu to withdraw his resignation and work diligently together to advance the committee's work.</p>
<h3>1946 Business Overview of the Bank of China</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Bank of China held its 23rd Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on the 14th. Details of the meeting were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Further details on the Bank's business overview for 1946 are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Deposits</p>
<p>At the end of the year, the total amount of various deposits in domestic and overseas branches was over 435.5 billion yuan, an increase of over 384.3 billion yuan compared to the previous year. Domestic deposits accounted for approximately 54%, while overseas deposits accounted for approximately 46%. Among domestic depositors, industrial and mining enterprises accounted for 41%, government agencies accounted for 35%, individuals accounted for only 11%, and groups and businesses accounted for 13% collectively.</p>
<p>2. Loans</p>
<p>At the end of the year, the outstanding loan balance was over 278.7 billion yuan, an increase of over 263.5 billion yuan compared to the previous year. International trade loans accounted for the largest share, approximately 43%, followed by industrial and mining enterprises at 29%, transportation and sales enterprises at 18%, and the remaining 10% allocated to transportation, public utilities, and other businesses. The government-assigned loan program for overseas Chinese to resume their businesses is still progressing gradually due to local legal restrictions. The guarantees issued by the bank under government orders are: (1) US$16 million for Yongli Chemical Company's equipment procurement loan, and (2) US$33 million for the US cotton loan.</p>
<p>3. Remittances</p>
<p>A. Domestic Remittances: The total amount of domestic remittances this year was over 19,129 billion yuan, an increase of 17,362 billion yuan compared to the previous year, with commercial and industrial remittances being the most prevalent.</p>
<p>B. Foreign Exchange: At the end of 1945, the International Department moved to Shanghai with the head office, and foreign exchange business also began to develop. On March 4th of this year, the foreign exchange market opened and exchange rates were adjusted. For export businesses, the bank simplified foreign exchange settlement procedures and provided loans through packing and export document financing to promote the export of domestic products. For imports of foreign goods, foreign exchange was only provided for essential goods. Less essential goods had to be curtailed to conserve resources. Over the past year, the International Department received a total of approximately US$33 million in export foreign exchange and paid approximately US$80 million in import foreign exchange. These import and export foreign exchange figures are not ideal, but they cannot be changed by the bank alone. The International Department and its branches collected and paid a total of US$120 million in import and export foreign exchange, accounting for a considerable portion of the country's total foreign trade value.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese remittances were handled according to the method of adding subsidies before the exchange rate adjustment in January and February, and the business was brisk. Since March 4th, the subsidy method has been abolished, and all overseas remittances have been converted and paid according to the Bank of China's posted exchange rates. Subsequently, the black market exchange rate gradually increased, and the amount received by the bank decreased day by day. By the end of the year, a total of over 61 billion national currency was received, approximately 60 billion yuan more than the previous year.</p>
<p>4. Investments</p>
<p>In the past, the bank's goal for investing in various businesses was to promote production in the rear and enhance the strength of the War of Resistance. Since the post-war recovery, construction has yet to begin, and the need for investment has become even more urgent. During the year, the number of projects approved by the Joint Treasury Administration for the bank to participate in continued to increase, and the targets were mostly production and distribution organizations.</p>
<p>5. Branch Network Dynamics</p>
<p>The number of branches in various locations has been increased or decreased as needed. By the end of the year, there were a total of 222 branches, 205 in China and 17 abroad. Among them, 58 branches in China, including Qingdao, Zhengzhou, and Changchun, have resumed operations. Five branches abroad, including Yangon and Haiphong, have resumed operations. Sixteen branches in China, including Tanggu and Fushun, have been newly established. One branch in Saigon has been newly established abroad. Twenty-six branches in China, including Lingling and Dushan, have been closed. One branch in Hanoi has been closed abroad.</p>
<h3>The Tobacco Market is Apparently Firm but Actually Soft</h3>
<p>The situation in the cigarette market yesterday opened strongly in the morning. The market for "Men Fei" and other brands was still good, and prices gradually increased. Ten-pack Great Britain cigarettes were once pushed up to 6.3 million yuan. As the market rose, selling increased frequently, transactions gradually cleared, and prices fell by 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. In the afternoon, there was some sporadic interest, so the price of ten-pack Great Britain cigarettes returned to 6.22 million yuan, an increase of 70,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Old Knife cigarettes and the Five Flowers Hardamen brand also rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Throughout the day, the situation in the cigarette market was that due to the upcoming "Plum Rain" season (starting on the 16th) and continuous deliveries from manufacturers, dealers were nervous about the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival and tight credit conditions. Holders rushed to sell at high prices, so it was difficult for prices to stabilize. Only the Old Knife brand was actively traded, with prices being pushed up to 5.26 million yuan for成交. Although it was a weekday, the Golden Dragon brand cigarettes from Huacheng Company were also particularly popular. Prices rose to 18,200 yuan, making them difficult to buy. Finally, there was a transaction at 18,500 yuan, an increase of 700 yuan from the previous day. Other Huacheng brands were also good.</p>
<p>Canned cigarettes saw a return to prices between 1,500 and 2,600 yuan due to more active sales. They also remained stable due to less spoilage during the rainy season. However, there were many shipments from Hong Kong recently, which were being sold on the market. Dealers were already satisfied, and there was very little inter-dealer trading, so it was also difficult for prices to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Interest Rate Survey</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to the interest rate survey of major cities across the country in the past week released by the Inspection Department of the Central Bank, the highest rate for interbank lending was in Ningbo, at 6 yuan per thousand. Next were Hangzhou, Jinan, and Zhenjiang, all at 5.5 yuan. Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beiping were all at 5 yuan. Chongqing, Hankou, Yangzhou, Wenzhou, Huaiyang, and Shijiazhuang were all at 4.5 yuan. The lowest was Jinzhou, at only 1.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The highest rate for interbank daily lending was in Jinan, at 4.5 yuan per thousand. Next were Hangzhou, Tianjin, and Yangzhou, all at 3.5 yuan. Shanghai, Nanjing, Xi'an, Beiping, Baoji, Taiyuan, Wenzhou, Santai, Leshan, Ningbo, and Zhenjiang were all at 3 yuan. The lowest were Jinzhou, Chengde, Changchun, Shangrao, Quxian, Pingliang, and Xining, all at 0.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Deng Huamin Returns to Shanghai from Beijing and Resigns as General Manager of the Sichuan Provincial Bank</h3>
<p>Deng Huamin, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tunghui Industrial Bank, recently went to Beijing from Chongqing to attend the National Political Council. After the meeting, he discussed the difficulties of Sichuan with relevant parties in Beijing. It is now learned that Deng Huamin has completed his business and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The reporter visited him and asked if he was willing to take the position of General Manager of the Sichuan Provincial Bank. Deng replied that the rumors were absolutely untrue. He continued to say that prices in Sichuan have been rising sharply in the past month, especially for rice. This is because of purchases from Beijing, Shanghai, and Hankou, with large quantities being transported eastward, and because of rising prices at the source, leading to increased costs. Those holding stocks were unwilling to sell, and there was a shortage of supply in the market, so the price of grain has risen to as high as 170,000 to 180,000 yuan per stone. Cotton yarn, on the other hand, has seen a reverse flow. As for the market, there is an extreme shortage of cash, so even for ordinary commercial needs, it is difficult to obtain cash for millions or small payments. This situation deserves attention, he said.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Exporting Frozen Eggs to the UK Resolved; National Bank Plans Remedial Measures</h3>
<p>The Loan and Grant Council's export of frozen eggs to the UK has been delayed due to disagreements on prices. There are still 4,500 tons undelivered. The UK price is 480 yuan per ton, while the cost of Chinese frozen eggs is approximately 600 yuan per ton in US dollars. After repeated consultations, the Business Bureau of the Central Bank has proposed remedial measures to facilitate exports. The UK still intends to order from China for two reasons: (1) Imports from China can be done through barter trade, saving the country's foreign exchange. (2) China's pre-war exports of frozen eggs to the UK accounted for 90% of that commodity's exports. Therefore, in order to maintain future trade, they are willing to increase the purchase price appropriately. It is expected that delivery can be completed by the end of September.</p>
<h3>Cotton Continues to Arrive</h3>
<p>The cotton market situation is that prices are weak due to continuous arrivals and falling external cotton prices. Customers are very willing to sell, and yarn mills are not very interested in buying. Credit conditions on the market have eased, and the market is still weak. Trading volume for various grades was slightly lower than the previous day, and transactions were not strong. In the afternoon, 75 pieces of Dangbao cotton were traded at a price of 1.5 million yuan. 100 pieces of Shashi Daguan were traded at a price of 1.46 million yuan. The above were all spot prices for delivery at the warehouse. In addition, 111 pieces of Shashi cotton were traded at a price of 1.435 million yuan, for delivery at the warehouse, with payment by check in seven days. 100 pieces of Hankou wood frame cotton were traded at a price of 1.16 million yuan, delivered to the factory, with payment by check in ten days.</p>
<h3>Timber Arrivals are Congested</h3>
<p>The timber market is very tight on credit, and recent increases in carpenter wages have affected sales. The entire market fell yesterday, and very little trading occurred. Hangzhou timber has fallen by one-third since the beginning of the month, from 850,000 yuan per tael to 500,000 yuan, with no buyers. Foreign pine has fallen to 6,500 yuan per foot. Five-tenths pine planks have fallen from 150,000 yuan per zhang to 120,000 yuan. Large cedar logs are 2,200 yuan per foot, and small logs are 2,100 yuan, a decrease of 1,000 yuan from the peak. There has been plenty of rainfall in various places recently, and timber has been flowing downstream, so arrivals are congested.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Leaf Loan Allocations for Various Provinces Determined, Totaling Over 27.9 Billion</h3>
<p>The tobacco leaf loan for various provinces this year has been approved by the Joint Treasury Administration to be 27,935 million yuan. The China Farmers Bank has also proposed a breakdown of the loan allocations (in millions of yuan) as follows: Sichuan Province: tobacco leaf production 300, processing 260; Guizhou Province: tobacco leaf production 300, processing 260; Anhui Province: tobacco leaf production 2400, processing 1845; Henan Province: tobacco leaf production 11200, processing 9610; Northeast Province: tobacco leaf production 600, processing 460.</p>
<h3>Business Conditions in the First Half of the Year are Generally Good</h3>
<p>The end of June is approaching, and all industries are preparing for their first-half settlements. Although credit conditions in Shanghai are tight, both the four major banks and the two bureaus, as well as the joint reserve pool of the banking and money industries, have released large amounts of funds, allowing businesses to turn over their capital. Therefore, the difficult month-end should be passed smoothly. It is heard that all industries have been profitable in the first half of this year, especially the yarn and cloth industry, raw material, enamel, and tobacco industries, whose conditions are very good. Although department stores and pharmaceuticals have profited significantly from rising prices, it has been difficult for them to sustain operations due to large expenses. The silver shops, gold shops, and money exchange industries have fallen into a stalemate due to government crackdowns on speculation.</p>
<h3>China Trust Greatly Purchases Rapeseed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui</h3>
<p>Rapeseed has come onto the market in producing regions, and it is currently in its waning phase. In order to increase the production of edible oil, the China Trust Bureau has already prepared a purchasing plan, entrusting the Third District Vegetable Oil Refining Association to cooperate in the handling of the task. Cadres have been sent to important producing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to purchase in large quantities. The designated personnel were dispatched a week ago and are actively working. The needed麻袋 (hessian sacks/burlap bags) were shipped out by the bureau the other day, with 50 bundles or 20,000 sacks to Wuhu; and 30 bundles, or 12,000 sacks to the Pinghu-Suzhou area. Once the new goods arrive, they will be rationally allocated according to the existing equipment and production capacity of each factory, in accordance with the established policy. It is understood that China Trust can obtain one-third of the total amount, with the remainder belonging to eight companies including Dayouyu, Dadexin, Dachang, Shunyu, Huimin, and Tongsheng. According to the current price of new goods arriving in Shanghai, the market price is about 160,000 to 180,000 yuan per 100 kilograms. Due to local custom, Wuhu weighs 138 to 140 kilograms per bushel, while Pinghu-Suzhou weighs 126 to 128 kilograms per bushel. The average selling price is about 210,000 yuan per bushel. Shipping costs from Wuhu have increased by 70% due to adjustments in ship prices. Pinghu and Suzhou, on the other hand, can be transported by帆船 (sailing junks).</p>
<h3>Increased Costs and Inconvenient Transportation Greatly Reduce Sales of Sichuan Summer Cloth</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 15th] Sichuan's specialty, summer cloth, is best produced in Rongchang and Longchang. The white ramie from Rongchang, Longchang, and Neijiang has light and soft fibers, with a pure white and beautiful color, and is the sole raw material for fine summer cloth. Therefore, these counties are the center of summer cloth production. The cloth-making process is roughly divided into three steps: first, spinning the ramie, weaving the fibers into ramie thread; second, weaving the cloth, spinning the ramie thread into raw cloth; and third, refining, bleaching, dyeing, printing, and sizing the raw cloth. Longchang and Neijiang are skilled in weaving and produce a lot of cloth. Neijiang's quality is the best, and most of the weaving is double-stranded. Rongchang is skilled in refining, as the water quality there is particularly good, and the bleached cloth is pure white and beautiful. Therefore, most of the bleaching, dyeing, printing, and sizing workshops are located there. Summer cloth is divided into plain cloth and羅紋 (ribbed) cloth, depending on the difference in the way the warp and weft threads are woven. Plain cloth is divided into clothing, bedding, and bag cloth, depending on its use. Each roll is about five zhang long and one foot four inches wide. The quality depends on the number of頭分 (threads) per roll. 頭分 refers to the number of warp and weft threads in the entire roll. Cloth with fewer than 500 頭分 is called coarse cloth. Cloth with 500 to 1,000 is middle-grade cloth. Cloth with more than 1,000 is fine cloth. The best can reach 1,600 頭分. Sichuan summer cloth is sold throughout the country and to Korea, Hong Kong, and other places. There are Beijing, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Guangdong帮 (guilds). At the peak of production, the annual output reached more than 600,000 rolls. However, due to the slow operation of household side-business small handicrafts, each person works only two or three hours a day, producing only one or two zhang of cloth. In addition, rising prices and inconvenient transportation in recent years have greatly reduced sales, leading to a decline in production. The average output is about 200,000 to 300,000 rolls, and the current price is 100,000 yuan per roll.</p>
<h3>The Source of Industrial Oils and Fats</h3>
<p>— Zhang Boan</p>
<p>The oil and fat industry in China still uses outdated production methods. Most oils and fats are produced by small units in the producing areas, and their scattered production and unregulated transactions have not been improved to this day.</p>
<p>Many people despise "vegetable oil" and "animal fat" without knowing their great utilization value and their relationship with everyone. Nowadays, with the prosperity of science, any substance has amazing uses. For example, "glycerin" is extracted from the oil and fat industry, and its extensive uses can have a significant impact on national defense. Without "trinitroglycerin," it would be impossible to synthesize explosives for bullets. Although TNT or Dynamite is more widely used, nitroglycerin is always a major source of explosives; the essential cigarettes and cosmetics cannot do without glycerin, and the nutrients that the human body absorbs every day cannot do without "oil" or "fat," especially since many industries cannot do without oils and fats. Recognizing this point, the importance of industrial oils and fats is no less than that of mineral oils.</p>
<p>Industrial oils and fats contain many types, the most widely used of which are cypress oil, tallow, coconut oil, and tung oil. Of the other edible oils and fats, apart from a few that are still used as industrial oils and fats, the most prominent are the four mentioned above.</p>
<p>Cypress oil is extracted from cypress seeds produced by cypress trees. The most commonly traded in Shanghai is "Heben." Heben is the abbreviation of Jiaxing Bencheli. Ping oil is produced in Wuping, Zhejiang (on the border of Anhui and Zhejiang), and Lan oil is produced in Lanxi, Zhejiang. Also, "Mingjian," "Jianma," "Macheng," "Chaixue," and "Jingbai" are either goods from north of the continent or goods from Hunan, mostly re-exported from Hankou. The peak season each year is December, and the production season is October. Most of it is used to make local wax candles, and soap factories can also use it to make soap, but its disadvantage is that it lacks luster and does not glow like coconut oil. Last summer, the price was 50,000 to 60,000 yuan per dan. This year, Heben's highest price was 850,000 yuan, more than ten times higher than last year. Recently, Sichuan梓汕 (Zishan) has been actively promoted in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The most popular tallow sold in Shanghai is蚌埠 (Bengbu) tallow. Tallow from Bengbu is the most sought after. There are also goods from Qingdao, etc. Sales are slightly lower in the summer each year, and the production season is from September to April. After April, there is no production. The daily output of Bengbu goods in this city is about 200 dan, and it is still necessary to supplement from other ports. At this time last year, each dan was 70,000 yuan, but now it has soared to 1.1 million yuan. Given that many producing areas have fallen into war zones, market inventory is very low, and further price increases are inevitable. All users must stockpile inventory to wait for the production season, so this period is the stockpiling period, after which production and sales will be weak.</p>
<p>The source of coconut oil is entirely imported. A lot was imported from Little Luzon last year, but now, as the goods have been imported for a long time, there are no further imports, and the inventory is extremely thin. Last spring, the price was 360,000 to 370,000 yuan per dan. In August and September, each dan only sold for 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. In February of this year, each dan reached a high of 850,000, and is currently at 1.2 million yuan. Coconut oil is most used by soap factories, and it is indispensable for soap factories. The current price from Hong Kong is 1.5 million yuan per dan, which is 300,000 yuan lower than the market price.</p>
<p>Tung oil is an export commodity, but the quantity used internally for paint is also very large, especially the usage for ships. The sales are very large every summer when ships are repaired. Recently, because the exchange rate is too low, exports are being withheld. The amount given is plentiful, and the price is also stable. The price last spring was 50,000 to 70,000 yuan per dan. The highest price this year reached 750,000 yuan. Now exports from Hong Kong must be 架匯 (priced based on the parallel exchange rate), so will the smuggling of tung oil to Hong Kong decrease slightly? Tung oil is the best of the drying oils. As the prospects for external sales are poor and internal sales are not attractive, tung farmers may lose interest in planting tung trees after a certain period. Recently, the China Trust Bureau has a barter agreement to transport 50,000 tons of tung oil to Japan, which is the largest export figure for Shanghai this year.</p>
<p>Other oils, such as lard and tea oil, are also exported, but in very small quantities. The refusal price of lard is 650,000 yuan per dan. The market price of tea oil is not known. Production in the inland is very abundant, but it is mostly used for eating. Soap factories also demand sheep oil.湯淮 (Tanghuai) (named because it is taken from oily water) is occasionally seen on the market, and the price is similar to that of sheep oil and lard. There is also egg yolk oil, and the price is not expensive, but there is very little. However, if this type of oil is refined for edible use, its nutritional value is very high.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Tanggu New Port (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Tianjin, 8th Day Aviation News, Xing Qishen</p>
<p>Tanggu is located on the north bank of the Hai River, facing Dagu. It is situated on the Bohai Bay, with the new port built here, located at 117 degrees 40 minutes east longitude and 39 degrees north latitude.</p>
<p>Tanggu closely connects Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin). Its land transportation is connected to the main lines of the Beiping-Suiyuan, Jinpu, and Pinghan railways. Its water transportation extends upstream along the Hai River, reaching the upper reaches of the Bei Canal, Nan Canal, Dajizi River, and Ziya River, penetrating inland for no less than 3,000 kilometers. In terms of sea transport, it can directly connect with coastal ports and ports in Europe and America. Therefore, Tanggu New Port occupies a superior geographical position and is a necessary facility for international trade.</p>
<p>The distances between Tanggu New Port and major domestic and foreign seaports are as follows (unit: nautical miles):</p>
<p>Qingdao 425 Shanghai 678 Hong Kong 1400</p>
<p>Guangzhou 1491 Dalian 195 Simonoseki 770</p>
<p>Yokohama 1418 Vladivostok 294 Manila 1736</p>
<p>Honolulu 4677 San Francisco 5664 Panama 8788</p>
<p>Calcutta 4450 London 2035</p>
<p>Hydrology and Meteorology</p>
<p>1. Tides: According to the Hai River Engineering Bureau's report from the 31st year (1942), the average high tide level at the mouth of the Hai River from 1910 to 1942 was 0.258 meters above the Dagu zero point. August has the highest average of 3 meters. The average low tide level is 0.76 meters, and the average tidal range is 2.12 meters. The tidal current direction is northward during flood tide, with a speed of 2 nautical miles per hour. During high tide, the Gejiang sandbank outside Dagu Port is completely submerged. The tidal current meets the shore, resembling a parallel flood tide. During ebb tide, the flow is southward, with a speed of 1 nautical mile per hour. During neap tides, the time between slack water and the change of flow often lasts three to four hours.</p>
<p>2. Wind Force and Direction: According to records from 1929 to 1937, the wind force in Tanggu is strongest from the northwest, with an average maximum wind speed reaching 86.4 kilometers per hour. The most frequent wind direction is from the southeast, followed by the northwest and southwest. The influence of wind on the rise and fall of tides is very significant. When there are north and northwest winds, the high tide time is delayed and the tidal height is reduced. East and southeast winds increase the tidal height and delay the ebb tide time.</p>
<p>3. Temperature: According to the Central Meteorological Bureau's records from 1928 to 1937, the average temperature in January is -4.7 degrees Celsius, with a minimum of -18.9 degrees Celsius. The average temperature in July is 26.7 degrees Celsius, with a maximum of 40 degrees Celsius. The average annual temperature is 12 degrees Celsius. According to recent weather records, on June 11, 1946, the highest temperature was 37.7 degrees Celsius, and on January 26, 1947, the lowest temperature was -15.9 degrees Celsius. The sea surface outside Dagu Port even froze over, a rare phenomenon in the past decade.</p>
<p>4. Rainfall: According to records from 1909 to 1937, the average annual rainfall in Tanggu is 503.7 millimeters, with July and August having the most rainfall, accounting for about 74.5% of the annual rainfall. The average number of rainy days per year is 53. However, in 1946, the average rainfall was 835.8 millimeters, with the highest rainfall on August 16, totaling 201.9 millimeters.</p>
<p>5. Ice: The period of ice formation near the mouth of the Hai River is usually from mid-December to the end of February of the following year, lasting about two and a half months. The thickness of the ice varies with the climate. On January 26 of this year (1947), the temperature was -15.9 degrees Celsius, and the estuary was frozen until late February. When the wind direction changed from northwest to east, the ice floes drifted away, and navigation resumed.</p>
<p>6. Fog: Foggy days are rare in Tanggu, and the duration of fog is also very short. On average, there are no more than six to seven foggy days per year.</p>
<p>1. Absolute Specific Gravity</p>
<p>First Mud Sample: Tanggu Pier No. 1</p>
<p>Second Mud Sample: East End of New Port Lock</p>
<p>Third Mud Sample: Tianjin Customs Pier</p>
<p>Compared with the specific gravity of the soil of the Yangzi River's Dangerous Rapids, which is 2.75, and the specific gravity of the soil of Pudong Malu Bridge in Shanghai, which is 2.71, it can be seen that the soil of Tanggu is heavier than that of the Yangzi River's Dangerous Rapids, and the soil of Tianjin is also slightly heavier than that of Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to the above standards, the analysis of the soil of Tanggu shows that it contains less sand and more clay, with fine and loose particles, similar to the silt of the Yangzi River's Dangerous Rapids. As for the soil of Tianjin, it contains more sand than clay and is coarser than the soil of Shanghai. The percentage composition of the soil is shown in the attached table.</p>
<p>From the attached table, the soil of Tanggu contains 26% sand and 58% clay. The soil is fine and mobile, with a small natural slope angle and extremely high lateral pressure. In construction engineering, this type of soil is easily compressed, and the ground formed by filling settles faster. Therefore, special attention must be paid to the architectural design of wharves, warehouses, and land facilities.</p>
<p>The new port is located on the north side of the Hai River. Because the Hai River carries sediment downstream, it accumulates outside Dagu Port, forming the Fuyi River (commonly known as the Dagu Dam), which has always been an obstacle to navigation. The purpose of building the port in Tanggu is to avoid the Dagu Dam and open up a new waterway. The newly built locks, wharves, and all equipment enable 3,000-ton ships to reach Tianjin directly through the new waterway and locks at any time. Larger ships can dock in the port to load and unload goods. The equipment and operation of each important project are described below:</p>
<p>Geological Exploration</p>
<p>Geology is closely related to port construction planning. The geology of the coastal area of Tanggu is alluvial. At the beginning of the construction of the port, the Japanese conducted geological explorations every 3,000 meters along the north and south sides of the new port, extending from the coast into the sea, with six explorations for each layer of seabed geology. Three more explorations were conducted on the shore, inside the port, and north of the north breakwater, for a total of fifteen explorations. The depth ranged from 35 to 50 meters. The results showed that the surface layer of the strata was mostly brown mud, about 6 inches deep, followed by dark brown clay. This layer was the most extensive, with some depths reaching 14 meters. Below that were dark brown sandy clay, brown or gray fine clayey sand, fine coarse sand, fine sand, gray clay, etc., with occasional shell fragments mixed in. The layers varied in depth and were uneven, but in short, they were nothing more than these several kinds of sedimentary soil.</p>
<p>Soil Testing</p>
<p>The absolute specific gravity and particle analysis tests were conducted on the soil behind the New Port No. 1 pier and the east end of the lock, and compared with the soil of Tianjin and Shanghai. The results of each test are described below:</p>
<p>Specific Gravity: 2.880</p>
<p>Specific Gravity: 2.798</p>
<p>Specific Gravity: 2.716</p>
<p>Soil Particle Analysis</p>
<p>The soil classification of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Chemistry and Soils was adopted as the standard for testing. The classification is as follows:</p>
<p>Transverse Breakwater</p>
<p>The construction of breakwaters is to prevent the intrusion of sediment and the attack of northwest winds. The south breakwater starts from the lock and extends directly into the deep sea, about 17 kilometers long. The north breakwater starts from the second pier and extends into the sea in a trapezoidal shape, 10 kilometers long. Only a part of each has been completed. Because the foundation is formed by the sedimentation of mud and sand and the geology is loose, the rubble mound method is used for the dike construction. The lower part is filled with stones that sink down, and concrete blocks are laid on the dike to stabilize the foundation. A transverse breakwater of 650 meters long is also built within the confluence to prevent sea waves from affecting the port and to maintain the calmness of the water surface within the inner harbor, which is convenient for ships to dock.</p>
<p>Channel Excavation</p>
<p>A channel is excavated between the north and south breakwaters, connecting the deep sea to the east and connecting to the Hai River through the lock. It is about 13.4 kilometers long. The original designed width was 200 meters, and the excavated width is 130 meters, with a depth of 5 meters. Because the breakwaters are not completed, the channel is silted up due to the impact of tidal currents. Although dredging efforts have been made, the expected results have not been achieved. After the work was stopped, the channel silted up more and more severely. From August 1945 to September 1946, the siltation was more than one meter in one year, especially near the lock and the first and second piers. The water depth was only between 2 and 3 meters, and the remaining part was about 3 meters.</p>
<p>The berthing area in front of the first and second piers is about 1,400 meters long and 400 meters wide, including the channel. The original excavation depth was 6 meters. According to the actual measurement in September 1946, the average water depth was only about 2 meters, and the severity of the siltation can be imagined.</p>
<p>Land Reclamation</p>
<p>The land reclamation project involves reclaiming about 5,000 meters of land from the coastline on the left bank of the Hai River to the sea, forming 32 million square meters of port land. The amount of earthwork used is about 13 million cubic meters.</p>
<p>Wharves and Locks</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the berthing of ships, it is planned to build the first and second piers from west to east along the south side of the reclaimed land. The first pier is 700 meters long, and about 90% of the revetment project has been completed and can be used. The second pier is 350 meters long and 8 meters deep. 60% of the revetment project has been completed. There are two coal loading machines for the export of coal and salt. However, after the Japanese surrendered, most of the electric motor iron enamel skinning was stolen, and almost all previous efforts were in vain.</p>
<p>In order to enable ships to reach Tianjin directly without waiting for the tide, the lock was built. The lock is located on the north bank of the Hai River estuary, connecting the outer port to the east and the Hai River to the west. Its purpose is to allow the sediment from the Hai River to enter the sea through the original channel, so as to avoid silting up the port, and to open and close the gates according to the high and low tides to adjust the water level, so that navigation can be carried out at any time. A delta is also set up 20 meters upstream of the lock on the river side to prevent sediment from the Hai River from flowing into the bottom of the lock. The lock is 180 meters long and 21 meters wide. The lock body is built of reinforced concrete, and the gate is a sliding type, which is opened and closed by a 75-horsepower electric motor. The water level is about 5 meters, and ships under 3,000 tons can pass through at any time.</p>

<h3>On the Salaries of Civil Servants</h3>
<p>— Luo Bida</p>
<p>With the recent adjustment of civil servant salaries, the basic amount in the Beijing and Shanghai areas is 340,000 yuan, plus 1,800 times the base salary. The so-called base salary is the grade salary, which is stipulated by the Civil Servant Grading Regulations. The current Civil Servant Grading Regulations were revised and promulgated by the National Government on November 1, 1945, through legislative procedures. The full text consists of 16 articles, which are simple and concise, and there are many commendable points, but it is still not perfect. Now, based on my limited understanding, I would like to offer suggestions for improvement, and I sincerely hope that wise scholars will provide guidance.</p>
<p>First, the regulations stipulate that newly appointed senior and recommended-rank personnel shall be graded starting from the lowest grade of their respective positions (Article 3). This provision seems unfair and unreasonable. According to this provision, a newly appointed recommended-rank clerk should be assigned to the lowest grade of a recommended-rank clerk, which is the 12th grade of the recommended rank. The monthly salary for the 12th grade of the recommended rank is 180 yuan, which is 20 yuan less than the monthly salary of 200 yuan for the 1st grade of the appointed rank. However, one of the qualifications for the recommended rank is having served in the highest-grade appointed position for more than three years, with only those who pass the assessment remaining (Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the current Civil Servant Appointment Law). In this way, although one is promoted from the appointed rank to the recommended rank, the monthly salary is reduced. From the perspective of the psychological state of those who are promoted, this is certainly unpleasant.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people think that rank and salary should be separate, rank is rank, and salary is salary, and it is even possible not to receive a salary. But this is ultimately a special case and is limited to the highest-level officials. As for lower-level civil servants, it is unprecedented to serve without pay. Usually, officials are paid, and promotion brings a pay raise. Therefore, when personnel in the highest grade of the appointed rank are promoted to the recommended rank, if the lowest grade of their position is below the 10th grade of the recommended rank, it seems inappropriate to rigidly stipulate that they should be graded starting from the lowest grade of their position.</p>
<p>If the rigid provisions of the law are fair and reasonable, they can not only be implemented but also guarantee good implementation, and of course, they should be rigidly stipulated; otherwise, there will be extra-legal provisions, thereby reducing the spirit of law-abiding among the general public. For example, Article 3 of the Explanatory Section of the Provisional Official Rank and Salary Table for Civil Officials (revised and promulgated by the National Government on March 4, 1946) stipulates: "Those who pass the higher-level examination and are appointed as recommended-rank clerks shall be graded starting from the 10th grade of the recommended rank." Another example is the table for calculating seniority in the Supplementary Measures for Civil Servant Appointment, which stipulates that graduates with specialized works that have been reviewed and qualified can be graded starting from the 10th grade of the recommended rank. Further, on November 30, 1944, the Ministry of Personnel handled the grading case for Wang Xuezeng, a recommended-rank clerk in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and determined that those who had served in the 1st grade of the appointed rank and were transferred to the recommended-rank clerk position should be graded starting from the 10th grade of the recommended rank.</p>
<p>Due to these exceptions, the provision that newly appointed recommended-rank personnel should be graded starting from the lowest grade of their position can no longer maintain its dignity and integrity. Legislation outside the law and law on top of the law have resulted in a proliferation of laws, making people unsure of what to follow. It would be better to revise the original articles and abolish the exceptional provisions.</p>
<p>Second, the regulations stipulate that newly appointed appointed-rank personnel who meet the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 4 of the Civil Servant Appointment Law shall be graded starting from the 8th to the 6th grade (Article 4, Paragraph 1, Item 3). Article 4, Paragraph 4 of the Civil Servant Appointment Law refers to the provision that those who have devoted themselves to the National Revolution for more than five years and have achieved results that have been proven to be true. Those who meet this provision should be graded starting from the 10th to the 6th grade, which also seems inappropriate. Because those who have devoted themselves to the National Revolution for more than seven years and have achieved results that have been proven to be true are qualified for the recommended rank (Article 3, Paragraph 4 of the Civil Servant Appointment Law). Those who have devoted themselves to the National Revolution for more than ten years and have made meritorious contributions that have been proven to be true are even qualified for the senior rank (Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the Civil Servant Appointment Law). The difference between five years or more and less than seven years is very small, so the difference in grade salary should also be very close. Moreover, the quality of the achievements and the length of time are not absolutely proportional. The achievements of those who have devoted themselves to the National Revolution for five years or more but less than seven years may be better than those who have devoted themselves to the National Revolution for seven years or more, or even ten years or more. Therefore, we believe that it should be revised to: those who meet the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 4 of the Civil Servant Appointment Law shall be graded starting from the 8th to the 1st grade. As for the determination of the starting grade within the specified range, it should be determined based on the achievements, time, academic qualifications, experience, and work ability of the proposed personnel who have devoted themselves to the National Revolution.</p>
<p>The regulations stipulate that newly appointed appointed-rank personnel who are graduates of junior colleges or above shall be graded starting from the 5th to the 4th grade (Article 4, Paragraph 1, Item 2); graduates of senior high schools shall be graded starting from the 9th grade (Article 4, Paragraph 1, Item 4); graduates of junior high schools shall be graded starting from the 16th to the 10th grade (Article 4, Paragraph 1, Item 5). However, graduates of senior and junior high schools are limited to those who have the qualifications specified in the relevant appointment law (Article 4, Paragraph 2). This provision seems debatable.</p>
<p>Junior colleges recruit senior high school graduates, and the length of study is mostly two years. Senior high schools recruit junior high school graduates, and the length of study is three years. In this way, the length of study for junior college graduates is only two years longer than that of senior high school graduates, but the starting grade salary is four or even five grades higher. However, the length of study for senior high school graduates is three years longer than that of junior high school graduates, but the difference in the highest starting grade is only one grade, which seems too small. It is appropriate to grade junior college graduates or above starting from the 5th to the 4th grade; the starting grade for senior high school graduates seems to lack uniformity, and it is advisable to restore the provisions of the old regulations, changing the starting grade from the 9th to the 8th grade. It is advisable to revise the starting grade for junior high school graduates to the 16th to the 12th grade.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we believe that within the prescribed limits, the starting grade of the proposed personnel should be determined based on the following standards:</p>
<p>(1) Whether the academic experience is commensurate with the nature of the proposed position. If it is commensurate, it should be higher, and if it is not commensurate, it should be lower, so that the academic experience can be used and the purpose of expert politics can be achieved.</p>
<p>(2) The quality of academic performance in school. Those with excellent performance should be higher, and those with poor performance should be lower, in order to cooperate with academic education and imply the use of diligent academic performance.</p>
<p>(3) Whether there is administrative or economic experience. Those with experience should be higher, and those without experience should be lower.</p>
<p>(4) The strength of work ability. Those who are strong should be higher, and those who are weak should be lower.</p>
<p>(5) The length of the statutory length of study. For example, if the statutory length of study for junior colleges is two years and the statutory length of study for universities is four years, the latter should be higher, and the former should be lower, which seems fairer and more reasonable.</p>
<p>Fourth, regarding students who drop out of school and become civil servants, their academic qualifications are not recognized by the regulations, which seems debatable. Of course, students should be encouraged to graduate, but in an unstable society, and under the current situation where the cost of school is too high, the number of those who have to drop out of school midway is increasing year by year, and the income of civil servants is difficult to maintain even their own food and clothing, and they are struggling with hunger; the huge school fees paid are mostly obtained by selling books, antiques, treasures, clothing, and borrowing; if there is no way to sell advertisements and no way to borrow, and it is not possible to gun down or steal, the academic qualifications of students who drop out of school and become civil servants should be recognized, and the starting grade should be based on the graduation qualifications before dropping out of school. According to their academic performance and the number of years of study, the starting grade may be increased by one or two grades.</p>
<p>Finally, we must especially solemnly put forward one point; that is, "orders cannot change the provisions of the law." Now the constitution has been promulgated, and constitutional government is about to begin, and there should be a spirit of the rule of law. The constitution should be higher than the law, and the law should be higher than the order. Orders cannot conflict with the law, and the law cannot violate the constitution. Laws that violate the constitution should be invalid, and orders that conflict with the law should also be invalid. This is the basic principle of the rule of law in the constitutional era. The current Civil Servant Grading Regulations were revised and promulgated by the National Government on November 1, 1945, through legislative procedures. According to the provisions of the Standard Law for the formulation of laws, anything promulgated by the National Government through legislative procedures is called law, which includes regulations. Therefore, the current Civil Servant Grading Regulations are of course law. The "Explanatory Section of the Provisional Official Rank and Salary Table for Civil Officials" was ordered to be implemented by the National Government on March 4, 1946, and has not gone through legislative procedures, so it is certainly not law, but an order. Furthermore, the Ministry of Personnel's appointment and grading determination case has neither gone through legislative procedures nor been promulgated by the National Government, so its effectiveness is of course lower than law and lower than the orders of the National Government. However, the current Civil Servant Grading Regulations stipulate that newly appointed recommended-rank personnel shall be graded starting from the lowest grade of their position (Article 3), and the lowest grade of the recommended-rank clerk position is the 12th grade of the recommended rank, and newly appointed recommended-rank personnel should be graded starting from the 12th grade of the recommended rank according to law. However, the "Explanatory Section of the Provisional Official Rank and Salary Table for Civil Officials" stipulates that those who pass the higher-level examination and are appointed as recommended-rank clerks shall be graded starting from the 10th grade of the recommended rank (Explanation Article 3), and the Ministry of Personnel's appointment and grading case determines that those who are promoted from the appointed rank to the recommended-rank clerk position shall be graded starting from the 10th grade of the recommended rank. Isn't this obviously an order changing the law, denying the provisions of the law? Although this change is reasonable, and this denial is in line with the principles of making laws based on reason and emotion, it should be changed, but in the spirit of the rule of law, this approach is inappropriate. Laws are drafted by experts and discussed by legislators, and are mostly very ideal when the legislative process is just completed; but when they are actually applied, it is inevitable that flaws will be discovered. However, the provisions of the law cannot be changed by order simply because there are flaws; nor can the law be enforced to the end regardless of whether the results are good or bad simply because there are provisions of the law. Implementation should be in accordance with the law, and the law that is perfect is ideal. Since the current Civil Servant Grading Regulations need to be revised, I hope that the legislative authorities can revise them, so that the grading of civil servants can be fair and reasonable, and that even though the salaries of civil servants are meager and their lives are hard, they can still work with peace of mind. I submit this to wise scholars for their consideration; I wonder what they think?</p>

<h3>The Prophet</h3>
<p>— Min Zi</p>
<p>God's prophet, the supreme seeker—Ar-Istafal, told the people in the city of Afalis everything between life and death, and then took his sailboat back to the Isle of Eternal Life.</p>
<p>When he parted with the people of Afalis, he said:</p>
<p>"My days among you are short, and the words I speak are even shorter.</p>
<p>"But when my voice becomes blurred in your ears and my love disappears from your memory, I will come again.</p>
<p>"I will speak with a fuller heart and more inspired lips.</p>
<p>"Yes, I will return with the tide.</p>
<p>"Although death will hide me, and greater silence will surround me, I will seek your understanding.</p>
<p>"And lo, my seeking will not be in vain.</p>
<p>"If all that I have spoken is truth, this truth will be revealed in clearer voices and plainer words."</p>
<p>Now decades have passed, and the prophet's voice has become blurred in people's ears and dim in their memories.</p>
<p>He came to Afalis again on that sailboat from the Isle of Eternal Life.</p>
<p>The female prophet Ermesha came out of the temple to greet this "dawn of the modern age" who was loved by the people.</p>
<p>Ermesha said to him:</p>
<p>Speak the truth to us in voices as clear as streams! Reveal the "truth" to us in clearer words, without any obscurity.</p>
<p>God's prophet smiled softly.</p>
<p>Time</p>
<p>Time is the most ruthless character. It has dragged me away from you for decades, and it has taken away my voice that leaped deep in your hearts.</p>
<p>It doesn't run fast for your sake, and it doesn't stop its forward steps for you either.</p>
<p>Like a stream, it flows very self-importantly day and night.</p>
<p>Do you want to know its power? -- It will drag you from the cradle all the way into the grave.</p>
<p>You work, you love, without any gaps, just like it.</p>
<p>In this way, it can only drag your body away, and your spirit will be immortal;</p>
<p>Otherwise, along with your stinky skin, everything will be reduced to illusion.</p>
<p>Only the future belongs to you, and the past has become the history in the hands of historians; then it will be sent to later generations for ruthless criticism: is it good or evil?</p>
<p>Live well, be a good person. O people of Afalis! Time does not have any difference because there are rich and poor.</p>
<p>Thrift</p>
<p>This is a good word, but it's not the best.</p>
<p>God has never created this word, just as God does not want you to indulge in sensuality.</p>
<p>This is like a plate of precious delicacies, which is superfluous luxury for people who are being eroded by natural and man-made disasters, but those who are tired of sensuality need it. But they insist on giving this dish to people who don't like it.</p>
<p>Millions of pieces of tree bark and Guanyin flour.</p>
<p>Millions of bowls of chaff and wheat paste,</p>
<p>Can't compare to half a seat of chicken tail wine.</p>
<p>(O people of Afalis! Do you understand the term "cocktail"?)</p>
<p>People whose minds are blinded by luxury and sensuality are precisely the ones who are calling for the slogan of thrift in voices as moving as singing, but they themselves are exceptions. Just like the emperors of the past who made laws but were not bound by them themselves.</p>
<p>Remember: A pretty good lie is a beautiful song.</p>
<p>But the highest intellect will never be blinded by songs. Because thrift has become a harsh demand for you.</p>
<p>Use the hands that you use to dig tree bark to dig your own path, the spring of the sensualists has passed, and the cold winter of wind and snow is coming.</p>
<p>Marriage</p>
<p>The marriage system, like two livestock, combined under the master's shouts of "Hey! Live together well," has passed.</p>
<p>So you understand love, and know that you not only seek the union of the body, but also seek a deeper confluence and tacit understanding of hearts.</p>
<p>The big bellies are innately aware of this truth.</p>
<p>Their extravagant and luxurious lives are the bait for fishing, and only the poor and humble fish will take the hook.</p>
<p>One day, they fall down from their decadent lives, and the cornerstone of unstable love collapses with it.</p>
<p>The mediator of a good marriage is never gold bars and beauty bans, have you ever seen the nightingale's courtship for material needs?</p>
<p>A beautiful appearance will not necessarily wrap a beautiful and kind heart, such a choice is a foolish silkworm, a foolish mistake.</p>
<p>You must love each other, drink milk together, but also drink bitter wine together.</p>
<p>A string can only play a monotonous note, it must be played with two strings to be harmonious.</p>
<p>Show each other your hearts, without any concealment.</p>
<p>A good marriage is the beginning of a career; otherwise, it is useless to use the hands of two people to tie your own feet, it is faster than one person.</p>
<p>Friendship</p>
<p>Friendship is the most precious thing in the world. But it is not a gemstone, but it is more enviable than a gemstone.</p>
<p>It is not built on a material foundation. If you and your friend have obtained it through competing for wine and food, this is like a tower built on gravel.</p>
<p>Friendship can have no other purpose than deepening each other's minds, deepening love, and understanding.</p>
<p>It is like a gentle hand,</p>
<p>It wipes away your tears, soothes your wounds, and gives your pain the highest comfort.</p>
<p>It is also like the spring breeze, sticking closely to your heart so warmly. There is nothing sweeter or gentler in the world than this.</p>
<p>It is even better than a mother's heart.</p>
<p>Friendship is not a commodity. You should not be stingy when someone asks you for it, you should give it generously;</p>
<p>But when it is not needed, you should not sell it cheaply like inferior goods.</p>
<h3>Bamboo Sparrow</h3>
<p>— Tang Yun</p>
<h3>Preface to Yutang's Seal Album</h3>
<p>— Ma Gongyu</p>
<p>The making of seals originated in ancient times, developed gradually, and flourished in the Han Dynasty. Making seals must follow the Han Dynasty, just like writing in the Jin Dynasty and poetry in the Tang Dynasty. However, ancient seals mostly used gold and jade as materials, and engraving and carving were two separate matters. Although those who made seals were proficient in various schools, the labor of casting and chiseling was often entrusted to craftsmen; therefore, it was rare for scholars to be known for engraving seals. In the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, there was the production of flowery milky stone, which was brittle and easy to be cut, allowing it to reach perfection at will. Scholars often liked to use this to express their emotions, so seal engravers emerged in large numbers. However, when literature prevails, quality is lacking, people do not study the ancients, and they create and flaunt themselves, competing for novelty; although the engraving is skillful, the seal script is violated, and the meaning of the seal is obscured. In the Qing Dynasty, the study of bronze and stone inscriptions flourished, and seal engraving entered the right path, with the Zhe and Wan schools as the return. Zhao Beifu of Kuaiji, alone melted and forged the strengths of various schools, and pioneered a new realm; his works were the most elegant and docile, but learning his steps was quite difficult. Qian Zijun Tao, has been engraving seals for many years, works hard, seeking to be like Bei Hui, and has fully grasped its essence. After accumulating rich drafts, he will gather and rub them to ask the world, and I will write a preface for him. I have always respected Bei Wei, and I am happy that Jun Tian can choose good and learn from it, which is different from the current trend of closing the door and creating things out of thin air and boasting about them. I once said that although seal engraving is a minor art, it cannot be accomplished without both talent and human effort; it is not enough to simply hold the old scores to speak of the big; one must be proficient in the seal script, have a thorough understanding of bronze and stone objects and characters, simplify them, connect them, combine the ancient without being rigid, and innovate and stand out on one's own; one can respond handily with a chisel, with plenty of room. This is where Bei Wei's victory over others lies. Jun Tao's seal engraving is already very similar to Bei Wei, and if he goes further to learn from his teacher, then it will not be difficult to temporarily replace Bei Wei. However, Jun Tao is modest, is involved in many things, and is proficient in calligraphy, literature, phonology, and music. How can he only be passed down as a seal engraver in the future! So I am happy to write a preface for him.</p>
<h3>Blessing of Youth</h3>
<p>— Li Wendong</p>
<p>Opening the window, a gust of good wind hits my face, making my heart sway, a oleander tree is full of spring light, for a long time, I have lost this kind of youth's expectation.</p>
<p>I often think of the Dutch painter Van Gogh's landscape painting titled "Spring", under the vast, gloomy sky filled with gray clouds and haze; the wind in various places lingers in the wilderness, with a little doubt and a little hesitation. In front of a low thatched house, in a poor and desolate field, a lonely peach tree silently lowers its head, enduring loneliness and spring cold, spitting out a few bleak small flowers, it is growing stubbornly in a firm posture, and the sound of blood flowing seems to be still rolling in the branches, this sound is very similar to the boatman's song that rises from the Jialing River, full of desolation and full of confidence.</p>
<p>This is a real, bleak spring, and it is also the fate of our generation, all our youth has been dedicated to the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Early on, I was overwhelmed by a kind of thought, and like a low wintergreen in front of the window, I completely became a little old man. The aging of the heart happened after returning to the east, as for the physical aspect, long-term work and wandering made my youth wither. But at that time, the heart was still strong, until the victory returned, I happily returned to my childhood Jiangnan, and when I returned to Jiangnan, it changed, my childhood friends had become strangers, the girl I loved had become an aunt, and there was a girl whom I had hugged and teased when she was in her infancy, and now she was too shy to raise her head when she saw me, and I also heard that she had learned about love. There were more who had already passed away, some died under the "appeasement" of the Imperial Army, some died in exile and epidemics, some sought short sights, and some simply lost them in a muddle.</p>
<p>From these constant births and deaths, I first felt the aging of youth.</p>
<p>Du Fu said in his poem to Wei Ba Chushi:</p>
<p>"...; how long can youth be, the temples are already gray</p>
<p>Visiting the old half for ghosts, exclaiming in the heat of the heart</p>
<p>..."</p>
<p>I didn't find any meaning in reading it when I was a child, but now when I read it, my heart beats non-stop, just like Dante's line; "Halfway along the road of my life..." At that time, the French writer France read it and threw it aside casually, but later when he entered middle age himself, he accidentally read this line again, and his whole body trembled.</p>
<p>The momentary realization made me shiver, and at that time it was still winter, and the cold and loneliness were pressing closer and closer, and the situation was quite embarrassing. When I thought of the days when I had lived, loved, worked, and suffered, those days were full of hunger, bombing, massacre, exile, love and tears, enthusiasm and dreams...</p>
<p>But spring still came as usual, everything was the old label, and there was no difference from the spring we encountered in the past, the spring of Hankou, the spring of Chongqing, the spring of Chengdu, the spring of Kunming, and the spring of the battlefield, life may have been an easy-to-fall banquet.</p>
<p>Now I have returned to the spring in Jiangnan, and young men and women are hanging a song called "Roses bloom everywhere" on their lips, I have never heard this song before, they sing it vigorously, and when I walk past them, they don't look at me at all.</p>
<p>The spring in Jiangnan is so beautiful, the sunlight makes my eyes dazzled, a small river flows vividly, a apricot blossom is red and charming; on the river bank, the grass is green, the green wheat seedlings and the yellow rapeseed flowers, the white clouds are stretching in the sky, on the road, pairs and pairs of flower-selling girls are flying and sending charming eyes, putting all the amorous feelings on the corners of their eyes, the clever young men are flirting and scolding, and the girls are ashamed and cover their faces and laugh. This is so good! It's just that I'm already old, like the amorous Turgenev standing on a desolate post station, saying goodbye to the past, and giving them blessings with a sad and sweet mood:</p>
<p>"The future belongs to you, your life will be easier than ours, and you will no longer be forced to search for roads, struggle, fall and get up in the black stage. We have to find the strength that supports us in pain, and many of us have failed—but you, you just have to work hard, such a blessing from me is for you, although I have sadness, but I have no jealousy, and no dark emotion..."</p>
<p>The song of life never ceases, singing down one after another, exchanging for new days and seasons, and we have already lived, loved, and suffered... Besides blessing you, what else is there to say?</p>
<h3>Yellow Sand</h3>
<p>— Chen Ying</p>
<p>I am afraid of the season when yellow sand falls.</p>
<p>I am afraid of the sand that obscures my eyes...</p>
<p>The bright sunny day outside the window suddenly turned yellow and turbid. A strong wind撲向the window sill, and also樸向me.</p>
<p>This is another day of drifting yellow sand.</p>
<p>When the land is immersed in the confusing wind and sand, there are old shepherds who sigh in melancholy. Some people also say that the travelers and camels walking in the desert are buried by the sand dunes, and there will be no news of him forever.</p>
<p>And my heart also palpitates on this moldy day.</p>
<p>When the yellow sand falls on the mountains and fields, on the roof of every house, when the yellow sand falls on the bridgehead, on the road extending to the distance; then, I see in the hazy sand mist, the hills are like floating small islands one by one, and the dove-colored clouds are like withered daisies.</p>
<p>But, I can't see the sun, I can't see the rows of flags walking on the road.</p>
<p>Although, the blurred wind and sand, seals everyone's eyes, and our breathing is closer, our hands are holding tighter, our active hearts will meet the refreshing blue sky that scratches through the dense sand nets...</p>
<h3>On Watching the Jinshan Idle Gulls Collaborate on Painting Fans, I Immediately Wrote</h3>
<p>— Lü Baihua</p>
<p>The misty peaks hide the eyebrows, the autumn water dims the eyes; holding a staff, I would rather leave my nature behind, the sound of pine mixes with the Hui merchants. (June 15th)</p>
<h3>Roman Rolland on Writing</h3>
<p>— Yan Chuan</p>
<p>French literary giant Roman Rolland had several valuable opinions on writing, which are very useful for beginners. Now, I excerpt them below:</p>
<p>1.  First piece of advice: Unless you urgently feel driven by social responsibility, your conscience, or some kind of inner need, never write. Merely participating in the already numerous ranks of writers for the sake of delusion or vanity is not only useless but also harmful.</p>
<p>2.  When writing, one must be honest. A writer should only write the truth, write what you think, see, and believe.</p>
<p>3.  A writer must strive to narrate the truth with the greatest possible accuracy, precision, and directness, as well as the simplest form; herein lies the whole secret of style. When a writer has no regrets in this regard, he can write very well. But this is very difficult, because a writer must constantly work hard to liberate thoughts from their shells, from their dust, from all the darkness, confusion, and unnecessary things that cover them.</p>
<p>4.  Such labor must be done by oneself, because each person must fight against his own shortcomings, and everyone is his own judge. However, this effort can be greatly facilitated by great and excellent classical literary masterpieces. A writer should study the overall structure, organization of chapters, the construction of sentences within these chapters, the logic of thought, and the value of words in these masterpieces.</p>
<h3>A Hundred Quatrains on Wu Ballads</h3>
<p>— Shu Zi</p>
<p>Although I lived in Suzhou for more than a year before, I was never interested in the local literature of Suzhou. Not to mention ordinary poetry collections, I felt sleepy just flipping through the table of contents of "Wu County Literary Compilation." The reason is that I had no interest in small, decorative local anecdotes. Occasionally, I skimmed through some local Wu documents, but mostly popular books, such as "Wu Xia Xian Lian" and "Wu Ge Shi Chao." Being a common person, my attention was limited to common things. My purpose was only to gain some scattered knowledge of customs and language from books.</p>
<p>Among this type of book that records common events, I liked several kinds, and Cai Yun's "A Hundred Quatrains on Wu Ballads" is just one of them.</p>
<p>The original book has one volume, published in the eleventh year of Tongzhi, Renshen. The book has a postscript by Shi _, which describes the process of carving the book, saying:</p>
<p>"Mr. Cai _ Geng of Yuanhe, with his writing _ bore a heavy name, and usually there were dozens of students following him. After his death, his disciple Cheng Gengtang (_ Mei) Xiaolian carved his complete collection of poetry and prose, which was around the early years of Daoguang. At that time, I had his collection, but lost it after the chaos. Recently, I copied his "A Hundred Quatrains on Wu Ballads" in one volume, and my brother-in-law, Su Jun Yaqing...re-carved it. I am happy that it highlights literature and can be used for old news in Wu. The carving has been completed, and I have described the whole process as such."</p>
<p>According to Cai’s given name Yun, styled Liqing, with the sobriquet Tie Geng, was from Yuanxiang, born during the Qianlong and Jiaqing period. He authored: “Cai's Monthly Ordinances with Commentary” in four volumes, “Pitan” in four volumes, and “Borrowing Autumn Pavilion Poetry Drafts” in eight volumes, see Cao Yunyuan's "Wu County Chronicle" Volume 58 (Part 1) "Arts and Literature Examination" (4). There is also "Borrowing Autumn Pavilion Examination Essays." According to Shi Tian's postscript, "A Hundred Quatrains on Wu Ballads" seemed to have been originally carved in "Poetry Drafts." The single-edition book has a preface by Cai at the beginning, unsigned and undated, and it is unknown when it was written. The preface says:</p>
<p>"Yun was born and raised in the Wu market, naturally a Wu simpleton, singing Wu ditties, roughly discussing Wu customs. Collecting the best of the year, searching for the latest news from the three counties; storing ballads in the poetry gourd, hiding advice in jokes. It covers everything at the time, which can be sung and can be told." The main theme of the whole book is nothing more than singing and describing the customs of the seasons, slightly like willow branches and bamboo branches.</p>
<p>Gu Lu (Tieqing) "Qingjia Records" quotes many poems praising Wu customs, and often cites Zhou Zongtai's "Gusu Bamboo Branch Lyrics" (six poems) and Cai's "A Hundred Quatrains on Wu Ballads," with the most citations from Cai's poems, totaling more than seventy items, accounting for a quarter of Cai's original book. However, the annotations attached to the original poems were mostly deleted by "Qingjia Records," and even when the original poems were quoted, the annotations were removed. In our view, the annotations are more important than the poems (the annotations mostly record Wu customs in detail). Gu's deletion is truly "returning the pearl and keeping the casket." It is fortunate to see the original book, as the original face is better than just seeing Xian Shi's deleted version.</p>
<p>There are a hundred poems in total, no different from ordinary bamboo branch words, but the annotations are quite detailed. For example: "Watching the leftover candles at the Lantern Festival, racing out to the boat to solicit blessings. Not letting the moonlight soak the lower realm, a shining pole and a lamp tower and a star bridge." The annotation says:</p>
<p>"On the thirteenth, watching the big pile of grain at Liu Mengjiang Temple, the candles are several feet high. On the fifteenth night, the gongs and drums are played for fun, called 'noisy Lantern Festival.' The land parade imitates the sounds of the dragon boat race, which is what the Stone Lake Poem's own note calls 'rowing a dry boat.' The dragon boat turns and rotates, commonly known as 'hitting the beckon.' Fireworks are made like firecrackers, planted on long poles and set off in the county, city, and walls, all sprayed out of the fire. Each time one is set off, there are several stories. All the bridges must be manned, and frames are placed like towers, with lights on each floor. The streets and alleys are also equipped with poles and ropes to make bridge lights. According to the 'Stone Lake Poetry Collection,' the Lantern Festival market is full of lights, including myriad-eyed nets and glass balls, which are especially wonderful. Today's customs only have these kinds and children's toys. The lantern decorations are at their peak between the second and the fifth, but they are still done every other year."</p>
<p>Another example is the poem about the New Year: "The stove mountain screen hangs, the well is sealed with orchids, burning the first incense and worshiping the joyful face. A hundred-year-old coin is distributed on a plate, and ten-thousand-year grain is offered on the table." The annotation says:</p>
<p>"The common people call the stove door the stove mountain, with _ offerings to the spirit horses, and after the welcoming sacrifice, it is covered with a curtain. No water is drawn for the first three days of the new year, and spirit horses are offered at the well's posterity, sacrificed and robbed, called sealing. On New Year's Day, incense is burned early to be pious, and there are people rushing to burn the first incense at midnight. Hanging ancestral portraits, or collecting them after five days or half a month. Fruits are distributed to children in a tray, with a hundred-year-old coin inside. At the beginning of the year, it is taboo not to wash rice, and leave it for several days to offer it, called ten-thousand-year grain."</p>
<p>Another example is the Dragon Boat Festival: "The heavy hammer dumplings are piled on a plate, good to serve with several cups of realgar wine, the remaining drips can still dispel the five poisons, spraying on the foreheads of the messy children and the door lintel." The annotation says:</p>
<p>"Glutinous rice without horns is called heavy hammer dumplings, a Dragon Boat Festival item. Drink Wanman wine during the Dragon Boat Festival, now mixed with realgar. The common people regard toads, lizards, spiders, snakes, and centipedes as the five poisons."</p>
<p>The records are all detailed and worth seeing, one level higher than Lu Gao. Therefore, the annotations are more worthy of attention.</p>
<p>In books that record Wu customs, previous people had Fan Chengda's "Stone Lake Yuefu," Huang Sheng's "Wu Feng Lu," and Wang Angdeng's "Wu She Compilation"; recent people have: Ju Zhenhe's "Suzhou Customs" and Gu Zhenyu's "Suzhou Customs Talk," etc. If they can be classified and compiled, it can also become a book like "A Classified Collection of Beijing Customs," and "A Hundred Quatrains on Wu Ballads" is one of the important materials for this book. But this matter seems impossible to talk about at the moment.</p>

<h3>Sixth Sense and Eighth Consciousness</h3>
<p>— Chen Ziqi</p>
<p>Professor Rhine, a psychologist at Duke University in the United States, and his assistant spent seventeen years of research to prove that a person has a sixth sense in addition to the five senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. This sixth sense is also called extrasensory perception. All mentally normal and sensitive people have the possibility of this sixth sense. Its function is to predict things and events that have not been seen, without being blocked by space and time; it can perceive the same pain as its relatives, and even suffer the same misfortune. This extrasensory perception is particularly significant in people who have a close relationship, such as twins and couples. The famous American Happiness magazine has given many examples to prove this significant discovery in psychology. This is indeed a very surprising thing.</p>
<p>However, as far as I know personally, this sixth sense is the eighth consciousness mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures, also called Alaya consciousness. The seventh consciousness is Manas consciousness, and the sixth consciousness is consciousness. The scope of this eighth consciousness is very broad, and it interacts with all mankind and various organisms on the earth. Everyone has it (regardless of whether he is mentally normal). Not only everyone has it, but every animal has it, no matter how small it is. Of course, mothers and children, couples, have a close relationship, and the function of this eighth consciousness is easily discovered. Twins have the same aura, and its function is particularly significant.</p>
<p>For example: in our history, there is such a record, saying: Zengzi's mother, one day because she had an urgent matter, hoped that her son would return from outside, so she broke her own finger. Zengzi was chopping wood on the mountain, felt a burst of heart pain, knew that something must have happened at home, so he hurried home. He asked his mother and learned that his mother had bitten her finger because of some urgent matter. Also, we read Huang Zongyan's "Ten Thousand Li Search for Brother." Huang Tingfeng was inspired in a dream by his longing for his brother, and finally met his elder brother Bojun in a toilet in Daozhou. These are all inductions caused by the function of the eighth consciousness.</p>
<p>Some people say. This sixth sense is similar to the function of a thousand-mile eyes and hypnosis. Because after being hypnotized, the subject can clearly say what has been sealed in advance. Yes, the function of hypnosis and the function of a thousand-mile eyes are indeed related to extrasensory perception (that is, what I call the eighth consciousness). The subject of hypnosis must first stop consciousness and enter a hypnotic state before the function of extrasensory perception can occur. Buddhism teaches people to meditate, nothing more than to stop their own consciousness and let the eighth consciousness fully function, so as to achieve a state of inner and outer unity. However, although the principles here are interconnected, the realm of meditation is not something that those who learn to use a thousand-mile eyes and hypnosis can dream of.</p>
<p>Finally, the function of this eighth consciousness is not unknown even in Confucianism. The Doctrine of the Mean says: "Nothing can be reduced," which means that people should not rely solely on the usual sixth consciousness to measure everything. Because this consciousness is the most unreliable; it is the most unable to understand the truth of things, so if you want to understand the truth of things, you must stop the delusion of this consciousness, "stop at the highest good," and then you can discover the function of "manifesting virtue," and then you can be sincere and have things, and understand the truth of things. The so-called "the way of perfect sincerity can foreknow," that's the reason, the "manifesting virtue" mentioned in this skin is the substance of the eighth consciousness. Zengzi elaborates on its function, saying: "Up and down flows with heaven and earth," able to flow with heaven and earth up and down, what is that if not the eighth consciousness?</p>
<p>The Buddhist scriptures and treatises have very detailed explanations of the substance and function of this eighth consciousness. However, studying it is not an easy task. We welcome Professor Rhine and other psychologists who study the sixth sense to come to China to study the eighth consciousness in order to glimpse this mysterious universe!</p>
<h3>Attitude at Mealtime</h3>
<p>— Guo Yongnian</p>
<p>Once, an experimental laboratory in the United States conducted an experiment. A cat was fed with rich and delicious food such as pig liver. After it fell asleep quietly on the ground, an X-ray machine was used to see its internal condition, and it was found that its food digestion was proceeding smoothly. Suddenly, a record player hidden behind the curtain made a burst of fierce dog barking. The cat immediately jumped up desperately, arched its back, erected its fur, and bared its teeth and claws. This was the external change. From the X-ray mirror, it was observed that the entire stomach was full of gastric juice, and the direction of the stomach's peristalsis was opposite to before. The delicious pig liver seemed like indigestible bricks in its stomach.</p>
<p>Looking back at us humans, the time when parents and children are most likely to meet in a day is at mealtime. At this time, the father often cannot help but teach and criticize the children's usual behavior, study results, etc., and the mother cannot help but defend the restriction of household expenses. Even the father himself. He may not be happy to have dinner with his family in this attitude. In this way, if an X-ray mirror is used to see the digestion of everyone's stomach, it will be the same as the experimental cat. Therefore, if people avoid talking about all unpleasant things when making food, the occurrence of indigestion, excessive kidney acid, and other stomach diseases in the world can be reduced a lot.</p>
<h3>Alice on Stage</h3>
<p>— Guo Hua</p>
<p>"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" is a famous fairy tale, and there are many Chinese translations. The author, Lewis Carroll, was a mathematics professor, but his fairy tale is incredible and whimsical, including talking rabbits and flying queens. As for the strange birds and monsters, there is no end to them. However, the good thing about this fairy tale is not its weirdness, but the fact that Alice, this little girl, still maintains a realistic character in the Wonderland, encountering all kinds of strange things. Although the environment is absurd and outrageous to the extreme, her every move is extremely rational. This can also be said to be a particularly worthwhile place to read in this fairy tale. Recently, this novel has been brought to the stage and is being performed at the "American Playhouse" in New York. The set design is exactly the same as Tenniel's illustrations in the original book. What's especially good is that Bambi Lynn's portrayal of Alice is exactly what the heroine in the book should be. Her gestures, voice, smile, and appearance are all the same as the character in the book. In other words, when the author wrote this book, it was as if he had Bambi Lynn in his mind.</p>
<h3>"Butterfly" on the Jeep</h3>
<p>— Bao Qing</p>
<p>Jeep arrives, and girls follow everywhere.</p>
<p>American Jeeps have arrived in San Dao, and are no exception. They have formed a green relationship with Japanese girls. Those Japanese "butterflies" are also known for producing virtuous wives and good mothers. It is good to have a husband bring a woman home to sleep in the same bed with his wife and not think it is strange. American soldiers' comments are that they have "friendly qualities, gentle personalities, and their enthusiastic emotions to make men comfortable."</p>
<p>Last year's national census in Japan showed that there were about three million more women than men. Under this surplus situation, in the feudal social environment, and with the impending unemployment and famine today, the fate of Japanese women is even more tragic. Although Japanese women have the right to vote and participate in politics, they cannot solve the plight of those sisters.</p>
<p>At first, the vocational guidance department of the government's "Overseas Compatriots Relief Association" introduced women who came to ask for relief to work as hostesses, etc., when they had no other choice, and even they were willing to be concubines and prostitutes. Although on January 14 last year, MacArthur ordered the Japanese government to abolish all contracts and agreements restricting women from serving and deprived them of the right to legal prostitution. But this only removed a layer of exploitation for the poor prostitutes.</p>
<p>The American military not only moved the hearts of those self-proclaimed noble geishas, ​​but also many young girls threw themselves into their arms. A Japanese girl marrying an American soldier got her parents' permission because they could get bread, sugar, etc., and even US dollars, which shows the seriousness of the economic relationship.</p>
<p>These friendly events even made it to the American newspapers. In a photo taken by a Associated Press reporter, an American soldier was holding a smiling Japanese girl in his arms. A soldier's wife actually thought that the soldier was her husband and wanted to get a divorce, forcing the husband to find the photographer to prove that he was not. The American soldiers' families at home are worried about this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Under this situation, MacArthur had no choice but (on April 2 last year) to give a letter to Pastor Swihart, asking him to find a way to stop this "friendship" that was obscured by "obscenity." MacArthur believed that it was absolutely impossible to strictly prohibit contact with the Japanese, and it would not solve the problem, violating the inherent self-esteem and personal rights of American soldiers. Therefore, he hoped that they could maintain a high level of morality, otherwise, it would not only damage the reputation of the army and the prestige of the United States, but also make their families feel very sad. Therefore, he asked them to strictly abide by the two points of "self-restraint" and "self-cultivation."</p>
<p>Therefore, for their own sake and for the sake of the country, the Jeep warriors should also listen to the commander's words! The American troops in other places should also listen.</p>
<p>One of the scenes of "On the Songhua River"</p>
<h3>May Loquats Fill the Woods</h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>According to the Compendium of Materia Medica; "Loquat, the leaves resemble a lute, hence the name," Guang Zhi says: "Loquat leaves are slightly like chestnuts, flowers in winter and fruits in spring, clustered fruits, hairy, ripe in April, large ones like _ seeds, small ones like longan, seedless ones are called Jiaozi." According to this, loquat fruits have become hot, but good varieties are always on the market around the Dragon Boat Festival. What Guang Zhi records are mostly Zhangcheng and other kinds.</p>
<p>Loquats have appeared in poems a lot, such as Guo Zhengxiang's poem: "I don't know where it is really comparable, I am afraid that the flying fruit has wax pills inside." Chen Ji's poem says: "The wind and dew fill the sky and the loquats are ripe, returning to offer to my loving mother to taste." Bai Juyi's poem: "The side of Huai Mountain is the shade of the Chu River, and the loquats fill the woods in May." Su Shi's poem: "The hawk orange is slightly yellow and still sour." Dai Shiping's poem: "The east garden fights and the west garden is drunk, picking all the loquats on a tree of gold." Lu You's poem: "I am not afraid of the wind shaking and falling on the branches, I only worry about the birds pecking at the tree." All are masterpieces.</p>
<p>According to Guang Zhi, seedless loquats are called Jiaozi, but if you want to make every loquat seedless, you can also do it manually, that is, when the loquat starts to flower, remove its flower whiskers. It is said that Zhu Zhuzhai of Xiushui and a Taoist priest did this, and there was a good story: "A Taoist priest watched that there were two loquat trees, and every time they ripened, he had to treat Zhu Zhuzhai, and they were all seedless when they were peeled and eaten. During the questioning, he did not answer. Zhu Zhuzhai loved steamed pork, so he bought meat and steamed it until it was cooked, and then invited him to come, ordering the maid to buy _ shoulders from outside. Therefore, the Taoist priest saw it, and he took it out to serve the guest in less than a moment. The Taoist priest was surprised at how fast it was, and it was already cooked through. Suddenly, Zhu Zhuzhai asked about the method of quick ripening, and Zhai said: "I want to exchange it for loquat seeds." The Taoist priest said: "Nothing else, just remove its flower whiskers when it starts to flower." Zhai said: "My meat is nothing else, it was steamed in advance yesterday." After speaking, they laughed together. This is still passed down as a good story.</p>
<h3>Yuan Wei Zhi and Yan Ji Dao</h3>
<p>— Qi Ren</p>
<p>Today, there are many bad phenomena of conflicts between the older and younger generations, just like what Mencius said: "The master teaches me with righteousness, but the master has not come from righteousness, which means that the father and son are hurting each other, and it is bad if the father and son hurt each other!" Because of the reason that "if the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam will be crooked", disputes in society and family are increasing day by day.</p>
<p>I once laughed at ancient literati who also had this disease, such as Yuan Wei Zhi to his nephew Shen Yun:</p>
<p>"I grew up in the capital, and I don't have many friends, but I have never known the home of an actor, and I have never watched a lively scene in a noisy place...</p>
<p>Later, when he arrived in Shaanxi, he wrote a poem expressing his ambition, saying that he was "indulgent in life," and even wrote: "...I didn't know I was young, I deeply understood things in wine, I could sing poems that violated the law, and I was particularly proficient in changing the meaning of review, containing words and waiting for the remaining beat, shouting and throwing the plate..." This is almost like being written by two people compared to the words in the letter to his nephew, which can be said to be extremely contradictory! Probably the words of teaching his nephew were feigned and upright, to deceive the child, while the poems eating, drinking, and throwing plates in a prostitute's house...were the real situation. The so-called poem expresses ambition, and words are the voice of the heart, so there is no concealment at all.</p>
<p>This reminds me of some hypocritical Confucians among my predecessors. They said: "When I was young, how did I abide by the rules, not look at what was not proper, not say what was not proper..." etc., but in fact they were all fake. "Evasive words show their poverty," covering up or exaggerating, and as a result, revealing their tails, it becomes even more ugly! But after they become angry in their old age, they are used to saying such things: "Bandits never want their children to be bandits, and opium smokers never want their children to smoke opium." This is called "being thin to oneself and generous to others."</p>
<p>For example, Yuan Wei Zhi, he can proudly say:</p>
<p>"Don't learn my shortcomings, you should learn my advantages, such as my literature, which is enough for you younger generations to learn. If you don't learn my articles but learn my drinking, throwing plates, and some romantic and impulsive behaviors, that's not right!"</p>
<p>Also, Yan Ji Dao, who scolded the most happily, when he was the director of Anhui Xuexiao, he smoked opium heavily, and the students pointed at him. He got angry, and then issued a _ theory saying: "With Ji Dao's knowledge, smoking opium is acceptable, but without Ji Dao's knowledge, smoking opium is not acceptable."</p>
<p>This seems to be a matter of course, and this high theory can be hung at the gate of the country, and no word can be changed. However, this always cannot make the younger generation convinced. Whether it is Yuan Wei Zhi's pretense or Yan Ji Dao's real anger, the result is the same as the next generation looks down on.</p>
<p>"He who teaches by words argues, he who teaches by example follows", from now on, we should still believe in this sentence in order to have the true price of education.</p>
<p>Although Yuan Wei Zhi and Yan Ji Dao are also amazing, but the amazing thing about them is not that they can pretend and be angry.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shou Ou</p>
<p>"But, you still have to bring some luggage," many people said in unison.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian pointed to the small leather suitcase he was sitting on.</p>
<p>"This one is enough! You guys deal with the rest, bring what you can, and it doesn't matter if you throw away what you can't." He hugged Fei Fei and stood up hurriedly.</p>
<p>Fei Fei also opened her eyes and looked at everyone, appearing quite reluctant.</p>
<p>But as soon as Lao Zhu stood up, several more careful companions discovered a difficulty. They were worried that he would not be able to carry Fei Fei in one hand and the suitcase in the other for a long journey. And Lao Zhu had been holding him like this, and the sick Fei Fei was also very tired. After they said this, Zhu Zhaonian himself also thought of it. After discussion, the final decision was to let him carry Fei Fei on his back. At that time, a female member of the group took off a square cloth bag with a very solid texture without thinking, and turned it into a _ shape, tying Fei Fei to Lao Zhu's back, so Fei Fei didn't necessarily need to hold on to Lao Zhu's shoulders, and Lao Zhu's hands could also be free.</p>
<p>"Is it comfortable, Fei Fei?" Everyone asked Fei Fei.</p>
<p>Her reply was a silent smile; after this exhausting work, her spirit seemed to be refreshed. "Fei Fei, give me the rabbit, it's tiring to hold it. Uncle Zhu will put it in the suitcase for you, okay?" Lao Zhu turned his head and said.</p>
<p>"No, Fei Fei wants to hold it, you will lose it if you give it to you." She replied very naively: "If it is really lost, what will you give to my younger brother?"</p>
<p>This made Lao Zhu and others laugh.</p>
<p>"Well, then," Lao Zhu nodded to the many companions around him one by one. "If you think our troupe is still unwilling to disband and still wants to maintain it, I suggest that you should first elect a responsible person so that everything will not be chaotic."</p>
<p>Everyone felt that it was right, but they couldn't think of who should be elected for a while.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, Lao Ying is the most suitable person!" Zhu Zhaonian pointed to the cripple and said: "He is very cautious and older than you guys, ......"</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, the people around him clapped their hands.</p>
