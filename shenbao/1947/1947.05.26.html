<h3>長春外圍共軍南下　四平及梅河口激戰　瀋陽城工事週內完成</h3>
<p>〔本報長春廿五日電〕長春近郊仍有小股共軍擾亂，昨午夜有共軍三百餘人竄犯實城子北五里唐營子，廿五日晨三時許被守軍擊潰。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿五日電〕原擬進攻長春共軍，已繞長外圍迂迴南下，襲擊長瀋路上重要城市，國軍空運部隊日昨飛越四平上空時，雖發現其西二十里內有大股共軍向城區移動，此間盛傳共車二十四日黃昏進襲四平，與國軍發生激烈戰鬥，本日軍方對此說未予否認，並謂：共軍主力確已判明南下，長春四郊近除西三十里之大嶺鎭及南約二十里之范家屯仍有少數共軍外，其他方面已無共軍。</p>
<p>〔中央社長春廿五日電〕長春市民於緊急情緒中，已渡過一週來最安靜之兩夜，並獲得安適之睡眠，隨連日國軍運轍機降落新機塲與城防布置之告成，此受共軍攻城威脅之六十萬市民不安心情，已漸趨緩和，市內秩序一如平時。</p>
<p>〔中央社吉林廿五日電〕此間由於共軍節節敗退，市內情形益趨良好，連日國軍空軍不斷輸送物資，民心興奮，勞軍工作正熱烈展開。</p>
<p>〔又電〕竄擾伊通·雙陽間之共軍，經守軍反擊，其勢稍緩，惟野心未死，有向東南繼續竄　模樣，國軍已趕往分頭圍勦。</p>
<p>〔本報長春廿五日電〕廿三日午攻陷長春東南雙陽之共軍一部，二十五日晨攻陷瀋吉綫上之烟筒山車站，動向不明，梅河口海龍一帶激戰甚烈。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿五日電〕四平之危急，已因空軍發揮威力及援軍之反撲，轉趨穩定，且共軍有被迫退却之勢。</p>
<p>〔本報長春廿五日電〕四平南面中長路鐵橋一座，被共軍破壞，四平西面之舊四平，已被共軍佔領。</p>
<p>〔本報長春廿五日電〕沿中長路南犯共軍約五個師，三萬餘人，因先頭部隊已抵四平附近，據此間軍方消息，四平近郊昨晚已發生激戰，惟戰鬥詳情尙無所悉，僅知平梅綫哈福車站（四平路），中長路郭家店車站（四平北）均被共軍攻佔。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽廿五日電〕東北廿五日以四平及梅河口戰事熾烈，梅河口方面共軍，以五師三旅之大兵力猛攻梅河口，國軍兵力單薄，情勢危迫。</p>
<p>〔本報潘腸廿五日電〕平梅路東豐·西豐·西安等地已轉安定，惟中長路西康平又失陷，法庫重受威脅。四平以北郭家店，黎樹國軍轉移陣地。</p>

<h3>北大清華燕京等校　決定今日起復課　胡適召見學生代表談話</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕北大·淸華·燕京等校，決自廿六日起「休罷」，胡適昨晚再召華北學聯及北大院系代表談話，勸廿六日能復課。胡氏稱：學生運動乃靑年對現實不滿之自然反應，而不能直指為共黨之指撥，惟政治·經濟問題，皆非罷課所能解決，更勿以罷課應付迭發之校內校外事件，如此，將永無平靜之日，愈是動盪時候，愈需鎭靜，勿輕信謠言。胡氏又稱：平當局對此次學潮處理皆未採干涉，但大家亦希望學生勿再鼓動罷工，更勿煽動中學學生，因渠等尙未成年，不能對任何事件負責，並且共軍距北平很近，地方當局不能不對此注意。</p>
<p>〔中央社天津廿五日電〕南開罷課學生，廿五日下午六時，續分十餘隊，分赴津市各工廠，學校宣傳「反內戰反飢餓」運動，並於校內演出「凱旋」，「萬元大鈔」等劇。</p>
<h3>對反內戰學生　徐炳昶進一言</h3>
<p>〔中央社開封廿五日電〕國內有名歷史學者徐炳昶，刻在此間講學，頃為各地學潮，特發表「對於反對內戰者學生進一言」一文，語重心長，足資深省，該文稱：「我今天要說的幾句話，並不是向極少的相信政府腐敗已經無可救藥非打倒不可的學生說的，而是要向大多數為想不出辦法，而極端困悶，即因此而有極易受人利用危險的靑年說的，近日全國各地學生的運動，差不多全是喊出「反內戰」·「要和平」·「反饑餓」的鮮明口號，這樣的口號，其自身毫無可非議，但自去年邊談邊打，今日專打不談的戰爭繼續以來，從一個角度看，可說從開始談時，兩邊就全沒有誠意，可是如果從另一個角度看，也很可以說兩邊全有誠意，他們兩邊所缺乏的，並不是這些，却因為另外兩點大阻碍，使他們的談判不易成功。」該文繼指出，第一點大阻碍，是兩方面互相猜忌，互不信任，第二點大阻碍，就是兩方面的武人——或者也有不少的文人——全相信他們打起來全很有把握。「他們旣不信對方，而又全信打起來有辦法，這時却希望他們不對打，眞是太不容易了」。該文結論稱：「這兩大阻碍，現在有一個幾乎完全消除，那在今日全國的人民起來反對內亂，要求和平，絕不是一件不正當的事情，但要注意的是，仗不是一方想打就能打起來，也不是一方面想停就停起來，俗語說，一個巴掌拍不響，就是此意。現在如果想用民衆的力量制止內亂，那就需要與所謂「解放區」的學生與民衆同時行動，一方面强迫政府，一方面强迫中共，同時停止鬥爭，靜候談判的解決，那才有成功的希望。否則單單名為反對內戰，實則是參加一方的助成內戰，增長內戰的態度，自身也已經變成內戰的當事人，還怎麽能反對別人」，這一點關係甚為重要，願今日大多數學生深思之。</p>
<p>〔又電〕河南大學農·工兩學院學生，發起復課運動，廿四日竟被校本部一部份同學所阻，惟請求復課學生，現仍毅然為愛護校譽與學業而繼續努力奔走呼號，渠等表示，不達復課與護校目的誓不中止。</p>
<h3>中大學生失蹤不確</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕前傳中大學生李樂定，朱培瑜，浙大附中學生江文通失蹤一案，首都衛戍部軍法處為明案情眞相，特派員往中大調查，該校訓導處負責人答稱：並無李樂定，朱培瑜其人，現學生均已全部返校。又該校自治會史訓道，董欣葆稱：江文通於廿日隊伍混亂時，有一同學（名不詳）拉他離隊，現可能住南京親友處。</p>
<h3>全國經委會今首次集識</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕全國經濟委會，定廿六日下午三時舉行成立以後首次會議。</p>
<h3>交長答覆口頭質詢</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕廿五日晨提出交通口頭質詢，有李培國·張定華·蔡芷生·段焯等九人，其質詢重點集中於飛機失事，鐵路不通，寳天路應迅速修築，及鐵路購票困難；京滬路秩序欠佳等等。張定華並提出湘桂黔路迅速修築的必要，同時交通部不應該以此為宣傳，說是工作情况如何好，實際上都勻至貴陽一段只修了十分之一，工款亦僅一百廿億，公路養路費儘管加，而橋樑路基則仍繼續壞。李培國對北方最重要之平古鐵路，至今　予修復，認為不滿。渠認為因而運輸不靈，因而共軍包圍熱河，因而戰爭失利，其責均在於平古路之不「通」。其次，路警之欺壓老百姓，不與百姓合作，尤為可惡。李氏認為該路形同為貪官汚吏所築。蔡芷生稱，平漢·津浦·隴海之交通都不靈活，不配合，有時一日一次車，有時一日四次車，而平漢隴海兩路聯運，不能合作，兩路距離遠，下隴海車上平漢車須步行三里路，於理不合。同時平隴兩路之弊端太多，運貨上下車之費用太大，幾成盡人皆知之公開秘密。段焯謂，天闌路迄今尙未完成，預算二百億。物價日日漲，如何够用？且認為西北交通應予注意，不能臨渴掘井。顧耕野提出東北接收的鐵路不多，而管理機構達二三個，而一個中長路理事長要兼交通部特派員，又得兼交部公路總局，身兼數要職，事情如何辦得好？顧氏鄭重提出，如此下去，中長路爭回的權利，將要再行放棄。李洽·陸錫光均謂寳天路應予修築，陸氏並謂俞部長可親自去看看。餘尙有提出京滬路秩序不佳者，旋復有書面詢問四件，至十時半畢，即由俞部長作答稱：本部有關接收事宜，均遵照法令辦理，至於有人認為鐵路修建偏於東南，實則因材料在沿江運輸較便，而西南西北則反是，京滬路之擁擠，則因旅客過多，除加價及加車外，餘無良策，惟目前不能加價。至黑市票則當予以改正，又江南鐵路當提前修復。關於滇越路目前因材料運輸不便，暫難進行，湘桂路衡陽附近已修成，餘正趕築，台灣鐵路接收後，係由台長官公署管理。</p>
<h3>參會第九次會議　朱家驊報告敎育</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕參政會第九次會議，廿五日晨九時半舉行，出席參政員一九七人，由吳貽芳主席，除宣讀第七八兩次會議紀錄外，進行交通報吿之口頭質詢及答覆。休息後朱部長家驊作敎育報吿，參政員提出書面質詢四十三件，一一宣讀，因時間忽促，至午後一時口頭詢問僅提出六件，決定廿六晨大會，繼續口頭質詢。主席乃宣布散會。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕敎長朱家驊廿五日上午出席參政會九次大會，作敎育報吿。朱氏先就敎育復員工作作一簡單叙述，略稱敎育復員是本着三十四年秋在重慶舉行的全國敎育善後復員會議所定的原則辦理的。現在大體上算是完成，各級學校早已開課，抗戰期中停辦的學校大多恢復。收復區的學校接收和調整亦吿一段落。學校的合理分佈也做到了一部份。朱氏次乃說明目前敎育上各重要問題：關於敎育經費，朱氏稱，卅五年度的國家總預算中敎育文化部門的支出，除了復員費六百億外，佔百分之二點零六，計四百七十九億八千九百四十九萬九千元。本年度為百分之四點零七九，計三千八百二十一億八千零八十萬元。至各省縣市的大約居其總支出的第二位。自去年財政收支系統辦法變更後，地方敎育經費更感困難，不論中央或地方，敎育經費的不敷，確是事實，但衡諸目前國家財政的實際狀况，負擔已覺不小，儘管如此，對於敎育經費的合理需要請求追加，政府都特別考慮；雖然國家財政萬分困難，而敎育經費仍在增加。我們對於敎育經費自然應該多方設法，逐漸增加，期能符合實際需要。如欲達到憲法上所規定的標準，還須期諸憲政實施的時候。</p>
<p>論及敎職員待遇，朱氏首對從事敎育人士生活的淸苦深表敬佩和不安，幷謂各級敎育人員的待遇，必須力求改善，刻不容緩。本部已在趕緊繼續努力設法中，例如大學敎授的待遇與公敎人員相同者外，雖然還有學術研究費的補助（最高額原為五萬元本年四月份起先調整為十五萬元，繼調整為二十一元），雖然敎授的薪額不像公敎人員的須受銓敘的限制而由學校就學術地位和年資來核定，然大學敎授的薪額，最高未有過六百元，任敎一二十年者，亦不例外，似可在官等官俸表規定限度內，酌量將限額提高。同樣服務於中小學等的待遇，亦應為適當的調整，期能夠做到安貧以樂道，共同維護這敎育的百年大計。關於學生公費，朱氏稱，公費的辦法原是抗戰中為顧及退至後方學生的家庭經濟接濟隔絕而定的臨時權宜措施，勝利後本應取消，但政府仍體念學生家庭經濟容或尙有困難，仍予維持。給予公費的意義，不外乎救助清寒及獎勵好學而成績優良者，普遍的公費待遇，在世界各國皆無比例的，現在在預算上本部主管的中等以上學校公費生共有十三萬名人建設員訓練班科公費生三萬五千六百名及救濟失學靑年公費生二萬七千名，共計十九萬二千六百名。公費生的待遇除每人每月二斗三升食米係按照學校所在地市價發給外，其副食費係比照公敎人員生活補助費基本數七分之一計算，例如京滬區學生公費除食米照舊外，副食費近已由二萬四千元調整為四萬八千元，以後並隨公敎人員待遇每三個月調整一次原則而繼續調整。查依照原預算，公費的支出已佔敎育預算總額百分之十五點七強，計達五百廿三億八千四百八十萬元，公費的發給向來提早一個月，亦無不啣接情事。政府的苦心如此，而今日入大學的負担最輕入中小學反較重。這種縱大平允的公費制，在一般社會經濟環境未改善以前，政府尙不考慮改變。</p>
<p>關於敎學設備，朱氏稱，我國學校及學術機關的設備原甚簡陋，抗戰中遭受了莫大損失，戰後補充亦感困難，經過了年來的努力，敎學的設備逐漸補充，勉強應用，如敎科圖書的缺乏經不斷與出版界商定辦法，大是印行供應原版西書雖格於國際著作權協定的規定不能任意翻印，然亦有數次向國外訂購及募集，分發千校，實習儀　亦儘可能購置，日有增加。本部近已擬具充實敎學設備意見及緊急措施經費計劃，包括外匯，務期於最近不斷使各校及學術機關設備增加。至於校舍等的增加修建，亦同時更進一步的設法。政府對此極為重視，不久可望逐項實施。</p>
<p>朱氏繼就現階段的敎育部中心工作，如國民敎育的推進，職業敎育的加強，師範敎育的趕辦，分別作一說明，並謂敎育是不可偏重，不可偏廢的，在我國多數人不識字的狀況下，如何使大多數人有受敎育的機會乃為最迫切而尋求角決的問題。高等敎育方面，全國公私立專科以上學校包摓　獨立學院大學，已有一百九十三所，學生約十二萬人，比較戰前學校增加了百分之八十，學生增加了兩倍。以國情來說，這也勉可適應需要，除非條件具備，設備實在，本部暫不輕易增加學校或改變學校體制的。敎育是不能停滯的，不宜抱殘守缺，一味墨守成規的，必須爭向時代而前進的。本部所有對學制的改革及教育的重要措施，都隨時的約請了專家舉行各種敎育部門會議，縝密研討製成方案，然後付諸實施，愼重將事。</p>
<p>最後，朱氏提及學潮，謂其原因固然不一，而就學校方面來說，經費不足，設備不全，一般社　的不安和外來政治的影饗等，自屬其因，都是潛伏各校的共黨份子，企圖以擾亂學校為一種手段來擴大擾亂社會的影響，遂其傾覆國本的目的，從而陰謀百出，煽動挑撥，無所不用其極，一心要在每一個學校裏策動一事件，來作發動風潮的題目，並應出一總題目來刺激人心，釀成全面的學潮。如今層出不窮的事實，業經證明無遺。朱氏向社會人士呼籲謂，我們斷不能讓有政治作用的人來搗亂學校，陰謀煽動者必須退出學校。我們絕不應讓少數人無法無天的行動，來妨害最大多數純潔靑年的學業，戕害民族命脈和國家安危所繫的敎育事業。學校是求學的聖潔園地，要百般設法激勵研究的精神和提高讀書的風氣。本部除了積極呈請政府並與各校會商從速解決學校的困難問題外，擬定年內召開第四屆全國敎育會議，來共同檢討，策進，革新。</p>
<h3>邵從恩病轉劇</h3>
<p>張院長等多往探視</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕七七高齡參政員邵從恩氏，因連日開會辛勞，廿四日晚赴蔣主席招宴時，突患腦充血，當晚十時許送中央醫院，由名醫戚壽南治療，現病勢雖已不最嚴重，然尙未脫離險境。吳鼎昌，王　五等聞訊，均赴院探視。記者今晨往訪，適江庸亦往探疾，據談：昨晚主席招宴各參政員，邵坐於蔣夫人及江庸之間，席間對坐者發現邵唇色變白，未幾，邵漸感不支，即傍江而坐，愈靠愈近，如是者約半小時，九時半許終至昏倒。另據隨侍在側之邵氏愛女慈雲談：「家父昨晚血壓最高時，曾至二百十度，現已减至一百六十度，脈搏亦已自八十八跳减至六十四跳。並謂：家父雖以高年，然關心國事，素不後人，昨晨開會歸來，友好多人來寓暢談國事，家父亦慷慨陳詞，且未午睡，下午本可不赴會，然因軍事報吿重要，仍勉强到會，此次腦充血，可謂全因辛勞引起。」按邵今年七十七歲，四川靑神人，曾身預辛亥革命之役，歷任四川民政廳長，紳班法政學校校長等職，自第一屆參會以來，以無黨無派身份，參加參政會以迄於今，並曾參加政治協商會議，此次係自蓉遠道趕來。邵妻六十二歲，有二女，四子，長女適蘭瑞生，次女慈雲任職四川省銀行，此次隨同來會，長次二子，肄業川大，三四兩子就讀蔭棠中學。</p>

<h3>左舜生在滬談話　目前為改進農業好時機　務使農村安定才有和平</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕農林部長左舜生，於廿四日夜車來滬，視察該部在上海各單位情况，記者趨訪於其地豐里私邸，承發表談話如下：</p>
<p>我到農林部，剛剛才有十天，但我已經接觸了許多實際問題，引起我很大的注意。我這次回到上海來的止的，是因為上海方面有幾個屬於農林部主管的重要機構，例如水產公司，魚市塲，蠶絲公司，經濟農塲，病虫藥械製造實騐廠等等，我要見見這此機構主要負責的人，看看他們所經營的業務，藉此多了解一點實際情况。假如有待解決的問題，也想找出一些妥當的解決途徑。</p>
<p>我這十天以來的感想，雖然覺得今天農村的衰落，農民購買力的低微，以及當前糧食問題的嚴重，十分使我焦慮，可是就中國農業的本身而論，還是有不少的令人樂觀之點：</p>
<p>（一）中國畢竟是一個有基礎的農業國家，而農民的本質，尤其異常優秀，所謂得天獨厚，是沒有疑義的。</p>
<p>（二）一般從事農業改進的朋友，他們的研究精神，大都異常强烈，假定政府能多給他們以機會，一定可以做出良好的成績。</p>
<p>（三）國際熱心改進中國農業的朋友，尤其是美國，我覺得他們那種誠摯的精神，實在令我們感佩。在最近的十天，我已接見了若干位美國農業，林業，漁業以及改進農具的專家，他們所給與我的印象，都異常良好。我相信他們都是抱有推進中美農業技術合作這個崇高目的的優秀人物，將來對於中國的農業一定是有極大的貢獻的。</p>
<p>我相信中國目前是一個改進中國農業最好的時機，我在職一天，決不輕輕放過這樣一個機會，可是一個主要的條件，還是中國的和平統一。中國必須做到農村安定，才會有眞正的和平，也只有農村安定，才是眞正的和平基礎，漢朝有一位循吏，能够使當時一部份好亂的人民辦到「賣劍買牛，賣刀買犢」，我願意拿這兩句話，為中國的前途祝福！</p>
<h3>參政會拾零</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　兪振基　張明</p>
<p>今天星期例假，但是大會繼續進行。尤其今天有當令的敎育報吿，所以出席的人數並不少於政治，財政，經濟報吿的會議。</p>
<p>敎部對這塲施政報告和質詢，無疑的在担心有一塲巨大的風波。因此，首先在報吿前做了不少活動，各方面打招呼。朱部長，杭次長在會塲上，表現得團團轉。</p>
<p>交長俞大維的答覆質詢聲浪極小，在後面聽的人，只曉得他的確在逐條答覆，而且連書面質詢部份也答覆了。</p>
<p>今天上午，首都天氣不睛不雨，有點沉悶。會塲上沒有開大砲，也不太熱烈，只聽得台下嗡嗡　　之聲。</p>
<p>散會時，主席提出，時間怱促，尙有十五位參政員的口頭詢問，可否改書面質詢請朱部長答覆，藉使會議進行迅速，但是黃宇人開砲了，他說：「敎育問題是大家所注意的，不能就這麼馬馬糊糊的敷衍了事，得在下次會議中請朱部長從容答覆」。接着潘期英響應，於是大家同意予以通過，總算這一砲是打響了。</p>
<p>吳望伋在休息時間，匆匆的在會塲裏寫家書。</p>
<p>交通質詢，口頭的大多是關於東北鐵路，書面的多數關於粵漢。</p>
<p>敎育質詢無論書面或口頭，大多帶點敎訓或訓斥的口吻，比如楊不平的書面質詢，劈頭一句話就是「請你拿出良心來，你說你到底把敎育辦好了沒有？」接下來，對於敎授學潮等等，速續的問了好幾個「你知道不知道？」有些人為朱部長受不了。</p>
<p>羅衡對何德奎案抱着奮鬥到底的精神，在敎育詢問裏，她又提到何德奎是推行奴化敎育的漢奸，以他審定的小學課本為什麽還能用？為什麽不辦？</p>
<p>張定華說是貴陽的航空站取消了，公路車票購買不易，眞弄得我們飛也飛不也，走也走不出，不是交通封鎖了嗎？</p>
<p>段焯說一個故事形容車行緩慢。他說：「有一個查票的，查到一個老人却是拿的半票，他問你為什麽是半票？老人說，我上車的時候還是小孩子呢。」全塲哄然。</p>
<p>（以下廿四日大會拾零）</p>
<p>廿四日大會中，根據左氏的統計，七年不足的農林部換了六個部長，第一任陳濟棠，做了一年多，第二任沈鴻烈，做了兩年多，第三任盛世才，不到一年，第四任不到一月，第五任周貽春做了一年多，第六任左氏自己，到今天恰恰到任九天。</p>
<p>有人吿訴左舜生，開灤煤礦的窰木四百萬根，沒有一根是中國貨。左氏說，如果我崇尙空談，就可以說「造林是多麽重要啊！」還有一件事，中央農事試騐所經費年僅十億，左氏認為如果以軍隊一師的經費來充實，</p>
<p>王　生質詢詩　首先提出左部長從參政　做了官，　沒有官架子，依然當年風度。左氏自己一上台就說『我做了九年參政員，深知參政員的心理，　的報告是沒有人聽的，』眞是　中要書，　　　　。</p>
<p>左部長一心怕人家說他用靑年黨的私人，所以一再的說，本人注重人才，不分派系，不管靑年黨或黨外人士，均以才幹決定，博得掌聲不少。</p>
<p>好些參政員提及編餘軍官問題，問起這些百戰功高的民族英雄，八年抗戰之餘，竟成「馬路將軍」，流落街頭，不知當局將何以處置？</p>
<p>記者出身的陳賡雅，為抗戰期間殉難同業呼籲，他問為什麼政府給申報金華亭及朱惺公，張小通，張似旭撫卹金只有三萬塊錢，够什麽用？</p>
<p>俞大維報吿交通共佔廿七分鐘，為所有報吿中佔時最短者，但所叙述之地名則包括南北東西海陸空，眞是最短的時間，最大的空間。</p>
<p>俞部長說，郵票一張印費是卅五元，加上運費要五十五元，還有一些其他的費用加入，一張百元郵票只能算本錢，五十元的還虧本。</p>

<p>〔中央社鄭州廿五日電〕安陽南下共軍與北上國軍尙未展開眞面目之戰鬥，雙方似均在尋求有利之態勢。安陽外圍廣紗紙廠一帶，廿四日晚仍有爭奪戰發生，共軍復吿挫敗，城內因有源源民食接濟，秩序益呈安定。</p>

<h3>美注視遠東情勢　經濟援助中國當可實現　對日和約立塲將加表明</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿五日電〕據權威方面本日談稱，目前之遠東情勢較諸數月之前已獲得高級官方更大之注意。國務卿馬歇爾及其高級顧問等已注意上週內亞洲方面之三項事件，即日本和約，給予中國中央政府之經濟援助，及美蘇對於統一朝鮮問題之談判。注意力現重新集中於中國貸款問題。馬歇爾曾稱：自渠由莫斯科返來後，已多方考慮此事，現正研究可博得國會及民衆所贊同之經濟上援助中國政府之方法。此間中國官員相信現有良好機會，可在六月底限期前動用進出口銀行五億美元貸款之一部份，且可延長限期。馬歇爾之聲明並表示渠所考慮者，更着重於直接由國會所授權之外交援助方針，如正給予希土二國者然。渠認為蔣主席在促使中國政府趨於自由化一點已有若干進展，未來之發展或可保證美國在經濟上援助中國政府。此間若干官員認為中國政府當局如能提出使用款項之滿意計劃，則仍有取得進出口銀行若干款項之機會。若干觀察家深信中國之政治情勢如吿改善，則美國在審查其計劃以後，有撥給一部份貸款並在中國推行由美國所管理之鉅大經濟援助計劃之可能。</p>
<p>關於日本和約，靈通方面希望美國可於今後數週中表明其對於日本和約之立塲，並開始向各國探詢程序方面之意見。政治與經濟之各專家對於美國需要與日本締結何種方式之和平一事，已研究數月之久，不久即可完成。美國對和會開會之日期與地點雖仍未確定，一般認為美國將建議於今秋，在華盛頓或舊金山舉行日本和約會議。軍界若干人士則主張在東京舉行。至於何國應參加草擬和約之會議，美國人十頗有主張即由十一國遠東委員會處置者，但若干官員認為該組織過於龐大，不能在相當時期完成工作，故主張由範圍較小之團體草擬和約。至於由四强或五强中任何一國草疑和約之議則必遭美國之堅强反對，蓋美國認為澳洲，紐西蘭，菲列濱等國較五强中若干國家在對日作戰時盡力更多而更久。</p>

<h3>來函</h3>
<p>頃閱貴報五月十日載有安慶縣銀行强膠節餘軍糧一則，與事實不符。查本行所購之糧，乃縣田糧處所征田賦項下縣應得之糧，上年十二月間縣政府以年關需款，會同縣參議會簽奉財廳濮廳長批准撥售，縣應得賦糧二千五百市石，每石訂價二萬五千元，嗣由縣政府召集地方機關士紳開會議定售與本行，增價為二萬八千元，成交後，仍就各該鄕保倉庫存儲。旋因亟待脫售，經本行董監事會於本年四月間邀請地方機關士紳舉行聯席會議，曁董監聯席會議，按照當時本埠米價規定價格，由承購人分別洽定承購，迨洽訂完竣，本埠米價突然飛漲，地方少數份子利用人心不安機會，藉詞煽惑，謂本行存米乃政府留備春荒，應即全數辦理平糶云云，羣衆不察底蘊，遂致釀成五九暴動。現在本案正由各上級機關澈底查究，眞相不難大白。貴報所載各節，諒係傳聞失實，茲特具函更正，即希賜予照登，以正視聽為荷。懷寗縣銀行啓。</p>

<p>（一）舉辦生產事業貸款：勝利後，鑒於復員建設需要甚切，經即督促四聯總處，對各種生產事業，大量貸助。關於農貸，去年度分緊急農貸與普通農貸兩種，原計劃貸放總額為三百億，後為適應實際需要，迭有增加，一年之中，據報緊急至現在止，已核定農貸計六千更隨時斟酌實際情形，令國家通，鹽務，糧食，貿易等項貸，及美金五百十餘萬，卅六年一至四月，已核定之工貸為一萬餘億，又東北流通券二百餘商業銀行資金，適用於生產途徑，央行前曾在滬領導銀錢行莊，組織工商業貸款銀團，辦理中小型工廠及出口貿易貸款，並由央行承做重貼現，轉抵押，及轉押匯，最近該行特設立貼放委員會，擬訂貼放通則，辦理商業行莊貼放，此項辦法，先試行於上海，再次推廣全國，是項措施，自可使一般資金投放於生產事業，而扶助全國經濟之復興。嗣更為統籌協助生產事業，經商同四聯總處擬訂「辦理各地生產事業貸款通則」，通行實施，指定就滬，津，平，靑，漢，長沙，南昌，渝，蓉，昆，穗等地區舉辦，由當地國家行局領導地方銀行及商業行莊推動辦理，對改善目前經濟狀况，尤有助益。政府近為盡量解除農工生產所受高利壓迫，特於經濟緊急方案中，規定加强金融　務管制辦法，明定各類銀行放款對象。</p>
<p>（二）建立金融體系：勝利後，財部曾就金融實際情形，參考各國銀行制度，草擬完整之銀行法規，其中包括中央銀行法，國營三行兩局條例，銀行法，儲蓄銀行法，省銀行條例等九種法規草案，送請立法院審議，不久均可制定公佈。此外對信託保險業務，亦加改進。此後各類金融機構，具有較完整之系統，配合運用，當可達成運用金融力量，扶植生產建設之任務。</p>
<p>（三）管理銀行業務，事前督導與事後糾正同時並重。關於銀行資金運用，年來仍本一貫方針，兼依照貴會歷次建議案，督導其投放於生產建設事業，以謀增產物資，平抑物價。國家銀行之授信業務，除由四聯依規定隨時督導外，並責成各該行局按期編製表報，轉呈審核。省縣銀行方面，則督由央行及各省財廳，分別監餐檢查，並由部予以審核處理。至商業銀行資金之營運實况，京滬行莊由本部直接派員檢查其業務，去年還都後，曾由部於兩地實施普查，計受檢查行莊達二百餘家，其餘各地行莊，則授權央行分別檢查，本部根據檢查報吿，嚴格審核，其有業務不正常，資金運用逾越正軌者，均經分別料正取締，不稍寬假。本部復為明瞭復員後各地金融情况，曁審核央行與省財廳檢查監理各銀行工作之成績，更實施巡迴稽核制度，並曾派員前往廣州漢口，考查督導。經濟緊急方案公布後，本部更加强檢查銀行，以謀配合而資整飭。至銀行錢莊之復業及推設分支行處，亦訂有限制，最近復指定京滬漢等十七地區曾限制行莊復業及增設分支機構區域，加强管制，相信金融業務此後當逐漸納入正軌。　（未完）</p>

<h3>安定第一</h3>
<p>——上海市參議會第三次大會開幕獻詞——</p>
<p>上海市參議會第三次大會於今晨開幕；在開幕以前，我們知道市參議會舉行了七天的各區市政座談會，潘議長又連續分赴各區訪問了九天，以冀探得眞正民意之所在。在此社會紛擾不安的今日，我們對於這次市參議會的召開，自不能不特別予以重視，而懷着滿腔的熱忱，期望這次參議會能盡其職責，多多代表市民說話，對於全市市民日夜所企求的安定，先能有良好的決策，然後可以進而謀市政的建設與上海的復興。</p>
<p>上海是我國最大的都市，不論在工商方面或在文敎方面，均為全國各省市之冠，而且又為中外觀瞻所繫，任何行政設施都足以影響全國，市政當局絕不致忽視其所處地位的重要。而代表民意的市參議會，更負有宣達民情，奠定民治的責任，在此高唱民主潮流之中，中國第一都市的民意動向如何，我們將於此次市參議會之成就卜之。</p>
<p>最近半月以來，學潮動盪，此息彼起，馴致少數別具用心者，利用純潔之靑年，將更煽動罷工罷市，以擴大社會之紛擾，人心浮動，幾無安居樂業之可言。故今天的政治設施，無論為國計，為民生，更無論其為中央，為地方，一切一切，要以安定為第一。國民滲政會此次開會的前後，從各方面來了和平的呼聲，參政會中現亦正在討論各種擬議的和平方案，也無非希望從和平獲得安定。其實照我們的看法，必須先有安定纔可達到和平。上海市民現在所最迫切渴望的，莫過於社會安定，而秩序的維護，自是市民與政府所應共負的職責。要知惟有在安定的情形之下，上海市政始可望其有日新月異的進步，同時也相信，唯有在安定的環境之中，市民始能安居樂業，恢復其抗戰期間創傷的元氣。上海市參議員均係由市民直接投票選舉而產生，不僅來自民間，而且應是最能親切了解民生疾苦的人；他們的開會，當不致類似有閒階級之淸談鳴高，亦不能徒以責難政府，消極批評為盡其能事。我們料想市參議會必能代表市民向朝野各黨派傾訴人民內心的痛苦，並且依照市民的願望，替今日上海紛擾的局面打開一條出路，引導這一夕數驚的上海，走入和平安定的途徑，進而達到復與繁樂的目的，為全國各省市樹立一個良好的模範。</p>
<p>聞截至昨日為止，市參議會接獲各參議員所提出的議案，已達九十餘件，各參議員為市政獻議為市民服務的熱忱，不難窺見一斑：不過我們處在此時此地，若有所獻議，似應有輕重緩急之分。上面說過，今日全國的人心，都在企求國內和平安定的實現，上海市民渴望社會的安定尤為迫切，參議員提議，自應確定一個重點，與其高談闊論，提出許多不切實際的問題，把寳貴的時間，浪費在無謂的爭辯上，不如針對現實，尋求方案，指示出上海市民與政府共同努力的方向，於全國蘄求和平的呼聲中，先能確切回復上海地方的安定，使大家能安居樂業，其意義異於尋常，其任務更加異乎尋常。我們於此，不能不再呼籲「安定第一！」</p>
<p>大局的苦悶與環境的險惡，雖使市民個個感覺到煩惱，但是市民的要求與願望，確實非常簡單，只要安居樂業。但如何能做到，使人民不失望，其實亦無奇妙，祇須政府能好民之所好，惡民之所惡而已！最怕是政府當局，渾渾噩噩，馬馬虎虎，沒有是非，不分皂白，只顧目前，不計將來，敷衍將就之結果，必致土崩瓦解而後已。姑以市民所望之安居而論，在目前的環境之中，戰亂烽火遍及全國，學潮米潮泛濫各地，再加以物價的飛漲，生活的重擔　野心份子的百端騷擾，壓迫得人民連氣也喘不過來，怎敎市民能安居呢？所以要使人民能安居，首在安定社會。國民政府曾頒佈「維持社會秩序臨時辦法」於前，上海市長對於維持治安，又復公佈四項執行辦法於後，上海各民衆團體也曾通電擁護，主張切實施行。但是社會的安定，完全只靠政府來維持，終覺得是可恃而不可恃的。這次市參議會對於安定社會，必須代表人民站出來說話，一則傾訴人民內心的苦悶，另則明白宣示出人民企求安定的願望，遏止一切野心者的陰謀，同時更使政府不授他們以可乘之間隙。參議員諸君，果能乘此時機，代表人民的意志，討論出一個安定社會的具體辦法來，好敎人民可以安居，比之通過幾十件幾百件議案有價値得多。</p>
<p>至於樂業，在社會安定之後，此較容易實現。不過我們不得不正吿參議員諸君曁市政當局，今日之上海，在表面上雖披着一件繁榮的外衣，但按之實際，却已投射下百業蕭條民不聊生的黑影。而尤其在郊區僻壤，或貧民窟中，簡直可以看出上海市實在包藏了兩個世界。一個是表面繁榮而實則奢華過度的「銷金窟」；一個是食不果腹，衣不蔽體，上無片瓦，下無寸土，朝不保暮，命如螻蟻的黑暗地獄！姑不說，如何眞正繁榮上海的工商業，而至少在消極方面、政府應該盡其可能避免一切足以妨害或摧殘工商業發展的措施，好敎市民人人都能樂業，自由發展其事業。在參議員之中，不少是工商界的代表，不論為本身的利益計，或是為其所代表的工商百業的利益計，都應在市參議會中儘量發言，列舉出目下工商業所遭過到的種種障礙與束縛，而要求市政當局一一為之解除。</p>
<p>要之，這次市參議會討論的問題，應以安定社會，解除民生疾苦為重點，其他不急之務，都可留待來日從長計議。這次市參議會對於安定社會如能有良好的決策，不僅是上海市民的幸福，而且其影響所及，可以普及全國。我們竭誠祈禱這次市參議會在這一方面能够有所收穫。</p>

<h3>美重視中東油區　決心防止蘇聯勢力侵入　康諾利訪問伊朗土耳其關係重大</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿四日電〕本社駐美京記者倫金稱：美地中海艦隊司令康諾利上將之訪問伊朗及土耳其，係表示杜魯門總統之防共主義有軍事力量為其後盾。康氏此行，可獲得珍貴情報以供發展美國新的全球戰略政策，以保護中東部份對於美國至為重要之利益。官方人士預料軍事設計專家當根據康諾利所獲情報，擬具美國新的軍略政策，以希臘土耳其及中東油區視為美國之生命綫為原則，其意並非表示英國已退出此等區域或美國已接替該區之責任。華府之英美官員對於此一說法，繼續予以否認，然美國之前項政策確具有下列之意義：（一）美國已接受在希臘及土耳其逐漸發展的責任，等於歐洲術語所稱之軍事同盟，且在蘇聯向該區進行被認為擴大政策之期間，美國決不放棄此項責任。（二）美國決不允中東油區落入蘇聯勢力範圍以內，蓋美艦隊在任何戰時行動中，均仰給中東石油之供給。（三）美國務院及陸軍部認韃靼尼爾海峽為對於任何使美國不惜以武力抵抗的威脅之關鍵所在。據熟悉英美統帥部戰略之官員稱，美國並不焰替英國在中東之責任，蓋因美國本身在該處亦有重大之責任，兩國之目標雖不時偶合，然為防止蘇聯對該一世界最敏感的多事區域從事擴大威脅起見，英美兩强必須保持軍事上之合作，以資戒備。</p>

<h3>史末資談話</h3>
<p>〔路透社開普鎭廿四日電〕南菲總理史末資於其七十七歲誕辰之今日接見美國「時代雜誌」代表發表談話，認為今日諸强關係雖緊張，但不致　動干戈。渠對美國華萊士所創之世界一家說，表示不信任。渠認世界應由英美蘇保持强國地位，蓋若僅由美蘇兩强經常接觸，則此兩「暴發」强國，必致不時發生衝突。渠復認二次世界大戰結束後，使世界處於不牢固的和平。歐洲勢力之退出亞洲，更增加亞洲之不安定。印度似巳屆長期動亂的邊緣，戰敗的日本已被完全壓制。但亞洲今已在亞洲人之手，自行負起責任。</p>

<h3>日首相着手組閣　決貫澈旣定方針　訪問三黨領袖請求協力</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿五日電〕社會黨中央執行委員會本日下午開會，片山首相說明組　方針，強調該黨旣定方針，即用一切可能方式貫澈組成舉國態勢之政治。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿五日電〕片山首相二十四日下午七時十五分首次招待新聞記者團，並即發表談話，大意如下：（一）確立民主議會；（二）摒棄官僚封建政治而建設和平安樂之國家；（三）安定國民生活；（四）為確立康寗政治而實行精神革命；（五）組閣係依照四黨聯合內閣之旣定方針而勵進。又片山於同日下午九時對全國國民廣播稱，「余於廿三日之衆參兩院，被滿塲一致選為首相，本日已舉行親任式，此乃係國民諸君之支援及信任所致。麥帥本日亦曾予以充滿好意之激勵，此決非予余一人者，而係對日本國家以及全國人民之鼓舞激勵。目前我國尙面臨不堪忽視之經濟及民族危機，余負組閣之重任，而更痛感為第一黨之責任重大，余當以至誠努力打開危機，希望各位亦體余之熱誠而賜以支援」。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿五日電〕社會民主黨刻以狂熱努力，致力及早組成聯合內閣。片山哲今往訪各黨領袖，與代表前首相吉田茂之植原悅二郎及民主黨領袖蘆田均會談，植原，蘆田均允於明日　明兩黨立塲。片山哲並曾訪問國民協同黨幹事長三木武天，三木保證國民協同黨將全力支持這才民黨。</p>
<h3>靜待吉田表明態度</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿五日電〕此間政治觀察家就片山組閣工作，已一致認為片山旣已獲得麥帥之支持，且巳舉行親任式，片山內閣可不致流產。惟因吉田之避不見面，似仍未改變其願退為在野黨之決心。社會黨雖努力組織四黨聯合內閣，亦不過人事而已，終將失敗。前所擬定之五·五·五·一閣僚比率，可能改為六·六·一比率其餘三閣僚則自衆院無黨派人士中選任，如此非僅社會黨左派入閣問題可獲解決，民主黨內部派系問題亦可望消除。總之，一切仍均待廿六日吉田返東京正式表示最後態度後，始能決定。</p>

<h3>墨西哥正考慮　恢復對日貿易</h3>
<p>〔聯合社墨西哥京城廿四日電〕官方經濟家今日聲稱：墨西哥雖已宣佈正在研究恢復對日貿易，但縱欲達到戰前數字，需時甚久，當時對日貿易亦不足墨西哥進出口總額百分之二。上週外交部接獲英國通知，謂可與日本商行恢復直接通訊後，曾老慮重開墨日兩國商業關係之可能性，但此種通訊限於詢問與答復市况，不能成交。戰前十年內，墨西哥對日輸出幾乎全係棉花·鋅·及精製鉛塊。數字變化甚大，一九三四年為一百四十六萬美元，一九三六年三千六百八十萬美元，一九三八年七百萬美元，而一九三九年則降至一百八十六萬美元。輸出品以絲。人造絲及紙製品為主，包括大宗低廉貨物如鋼筆·鐵器·燈泡·賭具·玩物及橡膠製品。數字逐漸上升，一九三四年僅輸入六十萬美元，一九三六年為一百四十萬美元，一九三八年一百七十萬美元，一九三九年一百五十萬美元。至一九四齡與一九四一兩年，進出口數字均增加一倍以上，但此種增加係由於改運前往歐洲各國所致。</p>
<h3>火箭試騐澳守秘密</h3>

<h3>菲失事飛機　殘骸在山區發現</h3>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺廿五日電〕菲總統羅哈斯之專機「麗蓮瑪林」號，載菲要員多人突吿失蹤，迄今一週，今晚顯已打破疑團。據負責搜索失機之葛拉塞少校稱，分頭派出搜紫之飛機五架，來電報吿，已在岷大拿島中部賴剛火山頂西面約十三哩之高峯上，發現新近失事之飛機殘骸。上有總統專機之號碼，淸晰可見，該機約在五千三百呎高度觸山峯焚燬，一翼折斷，墮於二百呎下山峯上，其近處未見生人跡象。</p>
<h3>美駐韓顧問來華　李承晚否認與美有秘密協定</h3>
<p>〔合衆肚漢城廿四日電〕美國務院遠東司副司長潘菲爾德上月杪抵此，担任混合委員會顧問一職，昨日突然飛往南京，任務不明。此間國務院人士稱，潘菲爾德於星期三即將回返此間。</p>
<p>〔合衆社漢城廿四日電〕朝鮮右派領袖李承晚頃向報界發表談話，斷然否認渠與美國務院有任何秘密協定。</p>
<p>〔聯合社漢城廿五日電〕朝鮮右翼領袖李承晚今日招待報界，對朝鮮政治領袖會同美蘇混合委員會，努力促成臨時政府事，表示同意。渠稱：「余不反對委員會，亦不反對他人與委員會商議，但余並不亟欲參加，因余殊不明瞭託管方式，且認為美蘇對於民主之定義，互相衝突」。李氏對委員會恢復談判，表示漠不關心。渠稱：「委員會欲使朝鮮獨立，一度已吿失敗，朝鮮人民並無應依賴委員會之理由」。朝鮮南部美軍司令霍奇將軍批評李承晚之言稱，李氏似已逐漸瞭解局勢。</p>
<h3>新聞報道方式　美蘇已獲協議</h3>
<p>美蘇委會美代表宣布</p>
<p>〔新亞社漢城廿五日電〕美蘇混合委員會美方代表白郞氏本日宣稱：美蘇兩方對混合委員會會議情形對外發表一事，業已意見一致，即會議經過情形雖可發表，但不採用正式公報之方式。</p>
<h3>世界工聯蘇委員　指責韓境美當局</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿四日電〕世界工會聯合會執行委員會蘇聯委員達拉素夫今日宣稱，執委會人員最近訪問朝鮮南部時，美國佔領軍曾竭力妨礙其調查工作。某次，朝鮮工人二名意欲歡迎執委，竟遭毆擊。事後根據美軍白朗准將解釋，此在朝鮮習見，不足為奇。執委會訪韓人員中除本人外，尙有美英法等國代表，美方建議加進軍事通譯與美軍官員二名，執委會根據某種明顯理由，卒予拒絕。此行留下慘痛印象。機塲上除獎國軍官外，並無朝鮮工會人員。入城途中，遇見朝鮮人一隊，計卅名，執旗歡迎。但司機加速行駛，隊伍藏塵奔追，法方委員雖擬停車，又為鄰座美方某軍官阻止。據朝鮮人士訴稱，彼等自美方探知執委蒞臨時刻，殊屬不易，朝鮮南部所有工業均在美人手中，且與日人合作經營。</p>
<h3>日人想像中的和約　擬組止重要島嶼轉讓他國　不許盟國政府干涉日內政</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿五日電〕日外務省已完成長達一百九十四頁之報吿，內討論「日本經濟復興基本問題」，「賠償問題之分類」，「生活標準及日本經濟」，甚至尙論及「和約之假設」，此種假設乃表示日本對和會之希望及目標者。中央社記者單獨獲悉僅供日官員參考之日政府對和約之假設，大多以對義和約為借鏡。</p>
<p>傳外務省主張對日和約簽字後，日本當儘早加入聯合國。日本已願將東北及關東租借地交還中國，以南庫頁島及千島交還蘇聯，惟對接近日本本部之各較小島嶼則仍準備爭持。彼等將努力阻止以若干島嶼之主權如硫球及若干日本委任統治地，轉移與其他國家。若日本能獲准參加聯合國，則彼等頗想以此種島嶼置於聯合國託管之下，而以日本為託管國。</p>
<p>彼等認為盟國除留若干較小之憲兵部隊外。將撤退其軍隊。彼等認為目前「佔領軍」與和約簽訂後之「駐軍」間，甚有區別，蓋後者將支特非軍事之監督機關，監察日本實行和約款。彼等預料此種監督機關，將設於重要地區，同時在北海道及九州派駐支部。彼等預料如目前盟國人員分駐日本各處之全國性佔領將不致繼續。</p>
<p>國際法庭對日戰犯如有判決死刑情事，日本盼盟國託付該國從事對彼輩之最後執行工作。對數以千計之罪狀較輕戰犯，如和約條款允許，則該國亦盼予以審訊。</p>
<p>日外務省所認為理想之對日和約，厥為日本主權不受限制，不許盟國干涉日本內政，和約文件中對經濟限制，將予特別規定。戰時工業當然不容存在，凡可改變為軍事用途之工業及企業，亦必有所限制，假定對日和約中並規定日本其他經濟部門之數字。但日外務省所述日本各種經濟上之需要，則說明日政府為求生存，將嚮要年產鋼十萬噸，紡織業有紡錘五百萬錠，及依一九四一年價格計算，尙需有卅四億日元之出口工業。</p>
<p>美國對日和約草案條款與日本自定之假設和約草案，究相接近至何種程度，乃受日本軍閥之害之十一國人民最為關切之問題。且渠等均亟欲獲得保證，俾凡可使日本恢復帝國思想之各種條件與環境不致有所發展。</p>
<h3>法總現頒布命令　徴用煤電氣事業　政府與工會面臨考騐</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿四日電〕法國內閣總理賴瑪迪本日簽署一項命令，授權政府徽用全國煤氣公司及電力公司之員工及設備，是項措施係本日閣議所決定者，將在明日「官報」中加以公布。按法國煤氣及電力工人為政府當局拒不批准增加工資百分之二十五，爰乃決定於本月廿八日罷工廿四小時，停止供應煤氣，並將全國電力供應减少至最低限度。法國內閣為此，乃於本日舉行會議，決定採取上述措施，以資應付。此外據悉，各省罷工及示威遊行本日迭有發生，但規模不大。里昂市鐵路職工二三百萬人之衆，本日列隊遊行，至市政府要求改善糧食供應情形，几爾賽營造業工人四百名為要求提高工資而實行「怠工」已為資方所解雇。諾曼第公共汽車公司工人亦因要求改善待遇而實行罷工。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿五日電〕法國煤氣電力工人之懈工，以及政府之宣布接收全國各煤氣電力廠及其工人，乃法國解放以來玫府當局與工會問最大之實力鬥爭試騐。接收煤氣電力工人之佈吿，將於今日揭示於全國公共塲所，關於如何應付可能的動亂，並保障煤氣電力供應之計劃，已於昨夜經內閣會同參謀部及法國各工業領袖協商決定。官方雖否認法國本部陸軍已奉令留營不得外出，以資應付工潮，然一般皆信類似於此之戒備措施確已採取。煤氣電力工潮表面似係因要求增加工資百分之二十三未遂而發生之孤立工潮，然觀察家則信此次工潮當為陷法國經濟於窒息之全面工潮的前奏。</p>
<p>防止工潮具有決心</p>
<p>煤氣電力工會已規定星期三為全部停工之第一日，是日亦為全國改善工作條件要求提出滿意答覆之最後一日，同時又為全國總工會決定應否接受政府於星期四決定在十二月一日前決不考慮普遍增加工資一項決議之日。政府今日顯然已面臨全面罷工之威脅，其本問題不在　一單位之要求調整工潮，而在政府之權力，在工會公然挑戰之下，是否能够保　政府立塲，迄至目前為止，仍異常堅決。工業生產部長拉柯斯特昨夜曾表示，「在今後數日內，全國即可見政府具有治國之決心。」法政府前此已斷然表示，為挽救法郞之崩潰，並使　國貨價得與國際商品競爭起見，在今年十二月以前，決不允工資之增加。內閣認為工人有不接受此項政策者，即等於向政府當局公然反叛。過去數月　全國各主要並來之工潮已在醞釀之中，至三星期前共黨退出聯合內閣後，工潮即一昇而達沸點。</p>
<p>接受挑戰結果難料</p>
<p>此次煤氣電力工　，乃工會跟政府實力之老騐，今政府旣已接受工人之挑戰，如結果並不能把握局勢，則對法國政局必有重大影響。單就此次煤氣電力工潮而言，賴瑪迪總理雖有社會急進及人民共和三黨內閣閣員之支持，然就更廣泛之水凖而論，蝙蝠迪不但面臨共黨之反對，同時亦而臨一部份社會黨之反對，蓋社會黨內部對於向工會採取之態度，意見猶有分岐也。除政治鬥爭以外，並不關心政治之一般民衆亦因日常生活之困難而造成對政府之不滿，例如麵包肉類之缺乏，生活費用之增加，以及官僚制度的束縛老百姓，均足驅使老百姓入於普遍失望的環境，而自然趨向覓取另一「救主」。</p>
<h3>英外相貝文　定期赴德視察</h3>
<p>〔路透社德國艾森城廿四日電〕北德煤礦管制局官員今夜宣稱：英貝文外相將於下月內來德境英軍區從事事實調查之視察。貝文並擬向魯爾區之德國民衆大會致辭。英內閣德境佔領區事務部大臣巴耿漢勳爵今日曾在北德煤管局與德國礦工領袖煤礦經理及英國煤務官晨等會晤。動爵在會中表示整個世界均注視魯爾之煤產增產，煤斤最有助於德國之恢復其在世界上之聲譽。魯　區產煤現已劇降至日產二十萬噸。</p>
<h3>美招募工人　在北區築機塲</h3>
<p>〔合衆社舊金山廿五日電〕美國世界航空公司擬於本年，以商業航空飛機，載送二千五百建築工人，自西雅圖運往阿拉斯加之范朋克，此項工人，由數西雅圖公司，與美陸軍工程團簽訂合同，自美國各地招來，擬在范朋克附近，從事大規模之機塲設備造建</p>
<h3>蘇在德境開採　鈾礦</h3>
<p>〔聯合社普拉格廿四日電〕據蘇聯佔領之德國　克沙尼區傳來消息，謂蘇聯正在著名之查奇姆斯丹爾　礦區北角，加緊開採。鈾鑛砂即原子材料，加緊開掘，殆即有新發現之謂。按注國科學家屆禮夫人即在該處　先發現鈾礦砂，提煉鐳錠。據　該礦專由蘇聯礦工開採，礦W　正確地點與開掘情形，嚴守秘密。按捷克境內之查奇姆斯丹　礦，戰時被德國開掘，解放後由捷　政府收向。一九三七年之出產量，為粗礦砂十五萬八千噸，目前因設備不足，故產量减少。捷政府稱，所產礦砂專供製造鈾質與醫療用　錠，捷克方面並不在進行原子能研究。</p>
<h3>美發現大量鈾藏</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕參議院方面稱：美國已在柯洛拉多河盆地，發現製造原子彈必需之大量鈾藏，極為豐富。原子能委員會並謂。美國得此後，殆可不必再仰給外來之供應。</p>
<h3>英工黨大會舉行在即　黨內矛盾益趨尖銳化　雙方展開思想戰爭</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿四日電〕英國工黨即將在馬蓋特舉行大會，因其將使工黨政府一般外交政策之擁護者及其反對者間之衝突，益趨尖銳化，故此問政界人士之視綫集中於此一會議。據觀察家談稱：雙方在過去數星期內，業已發動一種思想戰爭，工黨「叛黨」議員領袖克洛斯曼曾散佈一種小册子，其題為「停在左邊」，對方則發以「桌上之紙牌」為題，亦散發小册，後一小册未經工黨執行委員會批准而作為工然之正式聲明，殆將引起激烈之爭辯。此外工黨執行委員會若干委員任期已滿，需要改選，此點亦値得注意。樞密大臣莫里遜，燃料及電力大臣辛威爾，外相貝文及克洛斯曼均在候選人之列。另據其他方面消息，內閣人事可能即有調動，艾德禮首相將就此事向議會提供確切之情報云。</p>
<h3>英樞密大臣請工黨自愛</h3>
<p>〔法國〕新聞社倫敦廿五日電〕樞密大臣莫理遜今日警吿工黨謹防過度的利己主義。略謂，過度的利已主義於吾人有損失益。保守黨最近發表之工業憲章，對於英國之社會主義大有貢獻。可見社會主義各項原則已逐漸被輿情所接受矣。</p>

<h3>市參議會大會開幕　議長交議案四件　請收回大連澳門　市民函參議會反對房屋加租</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會第一屆第三次大會，將於今日上午召開，九時十時行開慕典禮，十至十二時舉行預備會並抽籤決定參議員席次。市府各局處負責人以及地方黨政軍首長屆時均將應邀出席。</p>
<p>該會秘書處昨繼續收到提案五件，但因該會整理提案已於前日截止，故昨日起所收提案將作臨時動議案，交大會討論。昨日所收提案中，有陳培德，張志韓，趙君豪三參議員建議市府處理米價上漲辦法七項，其大意謂：（一）每區視人口多寡爲比例，設立若干公米店以免購米者擁集一處，難以購得。（二）各團體機關聯合集體購米。（三）請政府鼓勵米商向海外訂購。（四）獎勵農民種植榖稻。（五）在公米店未設立前，由區民代表大會主席黄成區公所依人口比例辦理配售。（六）米蛀虫圖謀私利，擾亂社會，應予嚴辦。（七）筱快樂一案應由本會向司法當局請求秉公嚴究。</p>

<p>市府交議案，至昨晚尙未到會。議長交議案，目前僅有四件，惟悉議長尙有此次視察各區之提案多件，一經整理就緒，即送大會討論。現將已提出之議長交議案誌後：（一）爲准函本會函送會提二字第九號決議案關於學術進修金辦理情形，復請審議見復等由，提請討論案。理由：准上海市政府滬會一（36）字第一二三齡三號公函，以本會第二次大會，函送會提二字第九號決議案，為請將本市市立中小學校敎員及社敎人員學術進修費七十二億元，列入本市本年度歲出總預算百分之二十敎育經費項下，其有已向學生征收者，應行退還一案，經即轉飭敎育局呈稱：「查本年度市立各級學校，及社敎機關敎職員學術進修費，原經編列七十二億元，嗣因重編本年度預算時，本局歲出預算總數，僅得四百五十八億元，以上之分配各附屬機構經常費，及最需要之臨時費，已感不敷，如再列入是項進修費七十二億元，將使原有業務不能維持，思維再四，爰將鄕區尙未征收進條費之各校，先行編列預算十八億元，其未編列入之五十四億元，已另編追加預算，呈請專案撥付在案。至已向學生征收進修費之各校，迭據呈報，早經分發敎職員，須俟鈞府核准，追加預算奉發下局後，方能退還」等情。除照所呈進修費十八億元，列入總預算外函請審議，見復等由，提請公決。（二）准浙江省參議會浙二議臨字第一九齡九號代電，爲電請中央應以迅速有效方法，向蘇聯收回大連，囑一致主張，提請討論案。（三）爲准天津市臨時參議會電請政府與葡萄牙切實交涉，收回澳門一案，囑一致主張，提請討論案。（四）准電爲呈請重訂院轄市國大代表，改爲每區一人，幷於十名中分配婦女一名，囑一致主張提請討論案。</p>
<p>又訊市參議會昨接市民范丹，方棟，戚　，賈洙等，聯面反對本市房地產公會，籍詞現時房屋租金標凖訂定過低，要求從新調整，對日前該公會舉行茶會，招待參議員，冀籍大會力量，遂其漁利詭謀，龔斷民意，表示憤恨。請參議會注意滬市賃屋住居之市民，究爲極大多數，希凡百措施，應以多數市民意見爲依歸，絕不可順從少數資產階級之貪慾。並希參議會發動全市三房客互助會，以資聯絡，籍此防止大房東或二房東任意加租云。</p>
<h3>議長視察最後一天　配米技術亟待商定　希撥空地多建校舍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日爲市參議會潘議長各區訪間之最後一日，偕行者仍爲項秘書長，及工務·衛生二局代表，上午至老閘·黃浦·下午至新成·靜安各區，參議員，區長，區代表會主席等，均集中區公所迎候，對市政及社會現况，提供意見甚多，茲節錄如下：</p>
<p>（一）食米爲目前上海最重要最迫切之問題，中央按月配發之平價米，僅足市民三分之一的需要，故平價米之對象，當然只能限於赤貧者，惟對赤貧者之如何調査，如何配售之技術問題，希能由社會局在最短期間，召集各區長，共同研究一整個辦法手續，以平均簡單快速爲原則。</p>
<p>區保機構·費用不敷</p>
<p>（二）區保機構爲國家之基層組織，政府與人民均應亟予重視，目前上海區保辦公所，均無固定房屋，區公所多半租用民房廟宇，或借用警察分局內一兩個房間，保辦公處則僅就保長私人住屋內，設立寫字抬一張，而每月之辦公費用，以付水電費而不足，遑論推行政區命令，此種倒寳塔之形成，希政府與人民能切實合作，予以糾正。（三）獻校祝壽，人民興趣，極爲濃厚，各區均募有相當鉅款，老閘區已決定籌募二十億元，建築校舍，希市府能指撥空地從事建築校舍。</p>
<p>里弄道路·希加修理</p>
<p>（四）市區里弄道路破壞特甚，希政府能與人民合作，加以修理，且隨地便溺與傾倒垃圾及沿衖搭建平屋，阻塞街道，希能切實取締。（五）成都北路，山海關路，新昌路，均破壞特甚，希能加以修理。（六）靜安寺路，同孚路之張家浜爲一臭水浜，於市民衛生，極有妨碍，希政府能與人民合作，予以塡塞。（七）靜安寺區無市立醫院，希能有一衛生事務所。</p>
<h3>新製成三輪車　請市府發執照</h3>
<p>失業車夫向參會請願</p>
<p>自市府限制三輪車行駛後，本市各車商新製成之車輛一千三百二十餘輛，廢置已久，而待該項車輛發照後，藉以謀生之蘇北流亡難民，及失業工人車天等，亦盼該項車輛，能獲給照租駛，乃組織請願團，推派代表，昨日具呈參議會請願，要求繼續發給營業執照，提呈理由三點：（一）市府以中區交通擁擠，對續發三輪車執照，不加考慮，但除中區以外之其他區域，是否同樣呈擁擠狀態，及是否尙極需要交通工具，應予考慮。（二）僅因中區一隅交通擁擠，拒不採取折衷辦法，以救濟失業貧民，殊不合理。（三）請當局在無辦法中想辦法，發給不屬於中區行駛之牌照，即不妨以「東至外灘，南至金陵路，西至西藏路，北至蘇州河」之區域作爲禁止駛入區城。</p>

<h3>兩路客貨運　決定不加價</h3>
<p>交部月貼五十四億</p>
<p>京滬區鐵路管理局前因收支未能平衡，業務無法推進，於月前呈精交通部轉呈行政院要求調整票價。頃因　務會　通過公用事業，決定採取貼補政策，故已批示客貨運維持原價，不得增加。現悉，交通部爲平衡兩路收支，推進業務起見，頃決按月貼補兩路五十四億元，定本月份起正式實行云。</p>
<h3>南翔崑山段路軌　兩路局開始更換</h3>
<p>兩路列車迭次出軌肇禍，究其主因，十九因枕木及　　　　　所致。該局爲確保行車安全起見，前特呈請交通部　發九十磅　軌三十公里，樂於上　　到，除留用八公里，以便更換京滬綫各站主岔道外，其餘二十二公里，昨日開始在南翔崑山一帶擇要更換舊軌，預計六月下旬，即可全部換竣。茲悉：該局業已向美訂購大批新鋼軌，不久即可運到，兩路全綫鋼軌，當可全部更換。</p>

<h3>兩路貨運營業所問題　陳伯莊邀轉運商懇談</h3>
<p>京滬區鐵路管理局，前與京滬杭三地運輸同業公會代表商談貨運營業所問題，因路方未能完全接受其所提原則四項，致無結果。聞昨日兩路局長陳伯莊又復派員邀請上海轉運業公會理事長李慕蓮，往局商談，懇切表示，極願以坦白態度解決本問題，並提書面意見，訂有新辦法兩點，惟上海轉運商方面認爲此事必須與京杭兩地同業協商後，方能答覆。</p>

<h3>劇院坍頂壓傷衆客　無綫電播出怪聲廣告「妙文」成讖語</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西藏路四五一號國泰越劇院，昨晚上演彼丹桂，徐玉蘭主演之「是我錯」新劇，觀衆頗爲擁擠，未至開演、已吿客滿。詎至十時卅五分，該劇演至第三幕行將吿終時，靠西面一埭之天花板，因連遭大雨，且建築欠佳，加以不堪電扇震動，竟吿傾坍。幸在傾坍前，先有巨饗，繼之灰沙散落，故西邊觀衆得能及時躱避，未釀互禍，僅男女十七名受傷，誠不幸中之大幸。出事後白克路憲兵隊及新成警分局均派大批人員到塲彈壓，並急將受傷人分送中美·宏仁·仁濟三醫院。計傷者汪素琴卅二歲，錢妹妹九歲，丁陸氏卅二歲，丁李氏卅二歲，徐王氏卅二歲，金伯亮十七歲，徐弟弟一歲，方夏翠員卅歲，張蔡氏四十二歲，高國平三歲，方成德四十一歲，陳吳氏卅六歲，陸英十九歲，沈項氏五十一歲，沈新聯十五歲，華文英廿四歲，方張氏卅六歲等。後經各院包紮後均於當晚出院。在傾坍之剎那間，觀衆曾因急於逃命，秩序極度混亂。大部女客均遺忘大衣皮包，且其中有損失貴重飾物及現鈔者，故至深夜尙有不少女客佇立院外，正向院方交涉賠償中。當混亂時，有不肖之徒曾衝入塲中，「趁火打劫」，經警員拘獲二名，惟大部份檢獲大衣皮包，現存於該院帳房間，將交警局處理。又該院昨在各報所刊之廣吿字句內，有「觀衆擁，座位少，設備欠佳，是我錯」，不意竟成讖語。同時該院爲使該「是我錯」劇號召觀衆起見，夜塲由鐵風電合轉播全市，故此案發生時，最早得訊者，竟爲無綫電聽衆。</p>

<h3>增加生產挽救危機　國產廠商聯會　復員成立大會　通過會章票選理事監事</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市中華國產廠商聯合會復員成立大會，昨午三時假金谷飯店舉行，出席廠商代表一百餘單位。行禮如儀後，主席團主席王曉籟致詞稱：中華國產廠商聯合會成立於民國十九年，本提倡國貨鞏固國基爲宗旨，速年來會務頗有進展。抗戰時期，各廠商抱定國貨救國之心，協助抗戰，出力頗多。</p>
<p>勝利後至於今日，在嚴重之經濟危機局面下，受高物價，高利貸，高捐稅，高工資之壓迫，谷廠商莫不岌岌可危。爲自救救國，唯有提倡國貨，增加生產，以挽救危機。聯合會今後之任務，爲辦理國產產銷合作，調査統計，辦理各廠產品出口及必需原料進口，成立國產聯合服務所等。視國家經濟需要，奮進不懈，以協助國家工業化。繼由葛福田報吿籌備經過，社會局代表鄒今揆，市黨部代表周濂澤，吳市長代表王冠靑相繼致詞後，即通過會章，並票選王曉籟，潘公展，葛福田，潘士浩，金潤庠等二十五人爲理事，胡西園等五人爲候補理事。許曉初，榮鴻元等七人爲監事。史致富等三人爲候補監事。最後攝影禮成，至六時許始散會。</p>

<h3>三報停刊原因　鐵報所刊不確</h3>
<p>據本市鐵報昨日載稱，此次文匯，聯合，新民三報停刋，「係奉蔣主席核准執行」，籌備司令部發言人昨特發表鄭重聲明稱：「本部此次命令文匯，聯合，新民三報停刋，實因各該報連續登載妨害軍事之消息，及意圖顛覆政府，破壞公共秩序之言論與新聞，本市爲戒嚴區域，爲離　社會安寗秩序，保護人民生命財產起見，不得不予以停刋處分。鐵報所　係奉主高核准執行云云。完全不確，本除予該報以適當處分外，特此鄭重聲明，以正聽聞」。</p>

<h3>市工務局長播講　上海的修路難　主要在錢其次努力最後還得市民愛護</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本報於昨日假座福音電台（由合衆電台代播），舉辦第八次星期特別廣播，請工務局局長趙祖康播講，「上海的修路難」。茲誌其演詞如下：　出門行路的人，常常引用「蜀道之難難於上靑天」這一句話，依我看來，在上海修路之難，才確確實實的够得上說「難於上靑天」。這種困難是多方面的，不是單純的；好比生的病，這個病內外科，眼耳喉鼻各科俱全，百病雜陳，決不是一個簡單的藥方子，或單單的憑了「血氣之勇」，就能醫好的。</p>
<p>上海一共有五六百條「馬路」，總長一共有九百公里，也就是等於從上海到南京，從南京到杭州，再從杭州回到上海。這個三角形的總長，以面積說，上海的道路一共有七百五十萬平方公尺，也就是有一萬一千多市畝。這些道路並不是一個時期計劃的，也不是以同一目標來設計的。</p>
<p>工務局長趙祖康（本報攝）</p>
<p>新的需要種種困難</p>
<p>現在我們感到道路的系統不够合理，道路幅度的不够寬，道路結構的不够堅强。中區通路的擁擠，許許多多次等道路的凹陷不平，就是運輸量突增，和載重突增的後果。我們要增强道路的消化力，就要把道路系統改善，加闢路綫，放寬道路，使能適合運輸量的需要。可是，每計劃拓寬一條馬路，要洽商陳報的機構單位，不下十幾處，一般業主和住戶，因為小我利害所關，也可以發出許許多多不同的主張。至於加強道路結構，重新翻修一下，那也不是簡單的事。要用多少錢來翻修，可想像得到。所以我說要適合新的需要，是有種種困難的。</p>
<p>築路材料上漲驚人</p>
<p>先說人工和物質的困難，工務局經常雇用了五千多長工，但眞眞能到路上動手修補道路的，不足二千人。因爲待遇菲薄，這些工人的效率是不會很高的。我們只有在物質上與精神上略謀補救，以圖克服此一困難。再說材料方面，瀝靑·柏油·水泥·石子·黄砂的價格，高漲得驚人，最難處理的是漲的速度，使我們的預算追不上。物價這樣跳動，承辦商人都望而却步，不敢承辦。材料常常有斷絕之虞。沒有材料，修路工作如何進行？我們對於材料困難的解決方法，便是儘量設法使材料供應的長期穩定，使得供給材料的商人，和我們工務局，都能减少意外的損失，我們在這方面的努力，已經獲得相當的進步。　修築路面是具有技術性的，需要專門的設備和工具，在勝利後接收的時候，有五十二部壓路機，可是都是破舊的，有三處柏油廠，僅有一處是勉强可用的。現在兩個大廠都已修復了，還有幾部軋石機，也經過修理方可使用，但在外匯不易結買的時候，我們築路的機器應當增加的，迄今無法增加。</p>
<p>修補先後定有次序</p>
<p>此外還有一種社會的意識方面的困難，我們修路的先後秩序，是先修市內通行電車路綫和公共汽車路綫的道路，同時注意到由中區四向通到重要鎭集的郊區幹綫。有人以爲我們只修理行駛汽車的路是不平等的，這是一種誤解。又有人看到自己常常經過的道路未曾修，也表示不滿意。上海的道路太多了，壞得太厲害了。即使給予我們充份的金錢，還要給我們充份的時間，才能修復起來。</p>
<p>還有更大的一點困難，是少數市民不能愛護馬路，例如馬路上隨便丢素果皮果殻，甚至如甘蔗渣等，有害馬路的養護，還有洗衣服倒便桶的水也潑在馬路面上，以及菜攤的水，自來水龍頭的水，普遍的浸透路面，都能增加路面損壞的速度，更有溝渠淤塞，因淤塞而雨天路面積水，也是路面易壞的一個原因，這種後天的困難，又是我們工務局所無法克服的，那要市民的了解和合作了。</p>
<p>總而言之要解決上海修路的困難，第一需要錢，第二需要我們的努力，第三需要市民的了解和愛護。」</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律釋疑</h3>
<p>（一）債務糾紛</p>
<p>周天健問　某甲以歷年積蓄，託其友某乙放出，月息一角（即10％）。乙再以高利借與丙，由丙出具借據，但據上並未言明利率，並由丁某蓋章担保。現丙某經商虧蝕甚鉅，某乙屢次向其催還未果，諧問（一）可否向保人催索？（二）如丁不理，能否將其店中貨物作爲抵償？（三）如丁某不願，應依何種手續索取？</p>
<p>〔姜屛藩律師答〕（一）丁處於保證人地位，應負保證之責，如主債務人丙不能償還時，可向丁請求代爲償還。（二）向丁購買物品，係屬另一事件，若以其担保之借據作抵，除經丁本人同意外，依法不得爲之。（三）應由乙向丙請求淸償借款，如丙不能償還時，由丁代爲淸償</p>
<p>（二）絕賣回贖</p>
<p>何柯貞問　鄙人於三十三年，由友人介紹向甲某買進住宅一所，基地一方。當時甲某（係賣絕祖產）立有憑契。由中人乙某及渠族人在塲簽押。三十四年時甲某故世，翌年甲妻來函聲稱彼夫所賣出之房產中有一部份係屬彼個人之產業現擬贖回等語，並寄來柝產契約照片一張，上有中人乙某及其族人甲某等簽押。請問（一）此種賣買在法律是否非法？（二）甲某親自賣絕之祖產所簽之花押是否仍屬有效？（因甲某已去世）（三）中人乙某及甲某之族人旣在甲某分與其妻之契約上作證，何故再在甲某出賣房產時作證，在法律之觀點上乙某及其族人行爲是否連法？</p>
<p>〔姜屛藩律師答〕（一）此項住宅及基地，如係甲某個人所有，其買賣行爲，當然合法。（二）甲某在絕賣契上簽押，依法當然有效。（三）中人及甲某之族人在絕賣契上，旣經簽押，依法應負證明之責。</p>

<h3>台省科學調查團　昨已赴蘭嶼考察　一行六十餘人携帶儀器等六十餘噸</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北廿五日電〕台灣大學及台省海洋研究所，結核病研究所，地質調査所，氣象局，博物館等學術　關所組織之「科學調査團」，一行六十餘人，由海洋研究所長兼台大地質系主任馬廷英博士，及台大附屬醫院院長陳禮節敎授率領，携帶儀器等共計六十餘噸，今晨　台北赴基隆，乘專輪經台東火燒島，駛往盛產肺藥原料而無肺病患者之蘭嶼（舊名紅頭嶼），從事海洋氣象，動物植物，人類學，及醫學之攷察。按該島形如畢丸，位於合灣島之東南，其南即爲菲律賓羣島距台東約五十餘浬。全島面積僅有四十八平方公里，全爲山岳地帶，係由第三世紀海底火山爆發形成。島上溪流及泉水甚多，氣溫低於馬尼刺，但較恒春稍高。物產計有珍奇之肺藥原料「紅頭蘭」。居民僅有生蕃阿米族二千餘人，太平洋戰爭以前，日本醫學博士長谷川氏等，曾先後前往該島，舉行居民體格檢査，且用結核菌素一一試騐島上居民之反應，悉爲『陰性」。此項試騐之結果，極爲醫學界所重視，而被視爲療養肺病之聖地，蓋肺病者經此同樣試騐時，均有「陽性」反應也。該島且係太平洋之黑潮流區域，麕集之水產與魚類極多，尤爲生產學家視爲海洋之「處女地」，同時該鳥爲颱風首先通過之地，在氣象觀測上所佔之地位，亦極重要，去年台省發生颱風釀成巨災，曾有若干人士，認爲係因該島氣象觀測工作中輟所致。</p>

<p>長沙</p>
<p>〔中央社長沙廿四日電〕湖大校長胡庶華，以日前學生遊行，勸阻罔效，親自參加，藉維秩序，雖幸未滋意外，然以事違政府法令，特電敎部，引咎辭職並自請處分。</p>
<p>重慶</p>
<p>〔中央社重慶廿四日電〕九龍坡國立女師院今罷課，其藉口爲援助「五二齡」血案，其口號爲「反內戰，反飢餓」，主持者仍爲今春「抗暴」運動首要份子汪懽榮等。此次學潮發動後，汪等即至砂頭區煽動，但無效果，乃於昨晚在女師院召開同學會議，決定廿四日至廿六日罷課三日以爲倡導，同時決議以「六二」爲「反內戰日」，罷課一天。今日汪等於實行罷課後，再派代表至重大等校要求響應。</p>
<p>天津</p>
<p>〔本報天津廿五日電〕津市冀工學院，已於昨日復課，南開北洋等校學生，均已定明日復課。</p>
<p>北平</p>
<p>〔中央社北平廿五日電〕朝陽學院毆傷復課同學事件，已趨平復。肇事學生，刻經北平地方法院檢察處依法傳證偵訊中。</p>
<p>昆明</p>

<p>杭州</p>

<p>〔本報杭州廿五日電〕浙大學生，爲要求增加副食費，罷課已久，校方認爲荒廢學業，殊爲不妥，故今起復課，惟學生方面仍欲繼續罷課。</p>

<h3>浙大校友　勸同學復課　避免政治鬥爭</h3>
<p>〔中央社杭州廿四日電〕浙大校友五十七人，昨聯名發表吿同學書，略云：我們對於這幾天浙大同學的請願罷課，無時不予深切關懷，我們相信多數同學的動機純潔，同時我們相信政府在整個困難局面下，對於同學們要求各點，當能審察輕重，權衡緩念，逐步予以合理解決。戰後中國需要和平安定，更需要忍苦耐勞，如行動過於操切，影響社會秩序，增加政府與學校的困難，那末與同學們愛國愛校的初衷，背道而馳，尤其在實行民主政治的初期，要有良好的風度，才能作各界人士的楷模，爲社會與論所贊許。我們不忍這種輕易犧牲功課學業的情形，繼續發展下去，所以誠摯的希望同學們，早日復課。至於政治問題，希望同學們憑現實及學術觀點，提出積極性的建議，使浙大避免作爲政治鬥爭之塲合。</p>

<h3>為上海體育着想</h3>
<p>— 吳邦偉</p>
<p>上海，過去是全國體育的中心，今後還是處於領導全國體育的地位。因爲上海具有種種不可多得的優異條件，如人才的集中，經費的充裕，塲所的便利，學校的發達，尤其是有大量眞正愛好運動的市民，上海的體育前途，是無窮的光明，爲上海體育着想而說幾句話，或許不致認爲多事吧！</p>
<p>人才是多多益善，上海的體育人才，不論以體育爲職業的體育敎員，以業餘資格來提倡體育的熱心人士，過去均曾爲上海體育盡過一翻力量，其中不少是名聞全國的，現在似乎有一部份已經倦勤，我們希望他們能東山再起，繼續領導一切，以境厚我們的實力，來共同發展事業。新的人才，還希望能向上海集中，而且要從體育師資訓練機關中不斷培植。以學校來計算，假定每一小學平均二人，每一中等以上學校平均三人，我們至少需要兩千受過專門訓練的體育敎師，而以一般民衆體育團體來計算，更需要上千的體育指導人才，這不能不希望市立體專的努力了。　經濟情形雖不能說十分富足，各種運動比賽的門票收入亦尙可觀，如果有良好的制度，久遠的計劃，辦理經常事業，綽有餘裕，以此餘裕，逐年充實塲地，建築設備，十年之內，必可使上海的社會體育，發展到極理想的境地。同時政府方面要能依法將國民體育經費列入預算，配合社會需要，充實學校體育，則成效尤著。</p>
<p>體育塲所設備，在現在似乎是比較差一點，在公立的方面，南市體育塲粗具規模，市中心區體育塲尙未收回，且遭受損毁，體育館游泳池雖已發揮他最大的效用，但是對三四百萬市民的需要，相距尙遠。在民衆團體方面，市體協的各種活動，都是租塲舉辦，其他備有運動塲所設備的體育團體，亦屈指可數。我們認爲市立體育塲應有分年分區建築的計劃，使市民在五里之內，有適當的塲所可以運動。市政府可以頒布一種辦法，使民衆體育團體可認領公地或租用私地建設遝動塲，以補公立體育塲之不足。德國漢堡有市立體育塲大小六十一所，私立體育塲十五所，上海人口較漢堡爲多，我們不妨降低標準以求。</p>
<p>上海是寸金地，學校體育雖號稱發達，而沒有運動塲的學校，還是多數，這是一個嚴重問題。我們以爲有廣大運動塲地的學校，應該嚴格督促他們充分利用，並且要鼓勵他們分惠於附近缺乏運動塲的學校，以弄堂房子做校舍的許多學校，必須在無辦法中想出辦法來，使一般靑年兒童，有鍛鍊體格的機會。體育訓練在中學以後的年齡，是無法實施而收效的。至於學校體育的敎材內容，亦有硏究改善的必要，好在中學和小學的體育敎員們，爲着自身的進修和責任，已有相當健全的組織，敎育當局應設法透過這種組織，予以協助與指導，供給優良的敎材，商討實施的辦法，然後學校體育才能走入正常的軌道。</p>
<p>上海市民的體育熱忱，實在是可佩，這種現象，不但國內獨一，國外亦少見。但是上海究竟有多少體育團體，一共有多少會員，沒有人能答復，這就顯示組織的力量還不够健全。幾萬到幾十萬市民的體育活動，如果沒有健全的組織，合法的管理，是很容易發生流弊的，——這種流弊已在逐漸生長與暴露，市體育協會應該是全市民衆體育的首腦，我們不能不希望體育協會來處理這有關的問題。體協的構成分子應該是體育團體，——大者如包羅多種遝動的體育會，小之如一個單純的球隊，——每一團體有他固定的會員（或隊員）。體協的中心活動，固在舉辦各種競賽，而其眞正的成績，當屬會員（團體及個人）的數字的逐年加增，和運動範圍的逐年擴展。上海的社會體育，已經很發達了，發達到需要有健全的組織，用共同的規範來管理的一日。</p>
<p>總而言之：人才經費塲地設備，是體育的基本條件，學校和社會是體育發展的兩面，而各個之間，是有密切關係而不可分割的。如果有一部份停頓，全局就受到牽制，如果步伐稍有參差，必致凌亂，而負擔這領導全局的責任者，是主管體育行政的敎育行政機關，爲上海體育着想，敎育當局要拿出辦法來，用出力量來，指導督促這神聖的事業。上海過去是全國體育的中心，今後還是處於領導全國體育地位。</p>

<h3>市長官邸昨開會議　決設民食調配會　今日舉行首次籌備交換意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日來米價飛漲，人心惶惶，升斗小民皆感無以爲生。糧食部谷部長對此甚爲重視，特專程來滬，昨日下午一時在吳市長私邸召開重要會議，出席谷部長，龐次長，張總裁，吳市長，吳局長等，至五時始散會。席間對本市民食問題作詳盡之檢討，除積極疏通來源，嚴禁囤積居奇外，並決定由糧食部上海糧食總倉庫，中央信託局，市政府，市參議會，市商會等五機關，組織上海市民食調配委員會，凡有關本市民食問題，皆歸由該會統籌辦理。現由社會局負賣之學校工廠配米，亦將移交該會主持。調配委員會本星期內可告成立，今日上午先集會交換意見，以作積極籌備。</p>
<p>今日開售工廠配米</p>
<p>又訊〕本市工廠配米，一部份已經審核完竣，今日起即可開始配售。學校員生之配米，則因敎育局尙未將名册造送社會局，社會局一俟收到審核認可後，即可隨時配售。全市學校工廠及貧戶配米，中央允月撥食米二十萬擔及麵粉五十萬包，以後視需要情形，再可隨時增加。</p>
<p>預料米價可望下跌</p>
<p>社會局糧食科長吉明齋昨稱：連日米市波動，其最大原因爲受風雨影響，各地到貨稀少，持貨者不願出售，且自由喊價所致。待天氣放晴，各地來貨必可逐漸增多，同時工廠學校配米，本週內可實施，本市有一百餘萬人可得此項配米。且本市近郊小麥均吿豐收，故預料米價可望下跌。</p>
<h3>紡建儘量收購下　浦東棉花漸有轉機　棉農振奮本年可望豐收</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據浦東棉業中人談浦東各縣，素以棉花爲大宗農產。戰前盛時，年產數百萬担。供銷滬市，作紗業原料。淪陷時期，因遭敵偽統制，貶價收購，備受摧殘。棉農虧本，被迫改植糧食，故多將棉地改作稻田。惟浦東土壞，宜於棉作，種棉較種稻收穫豐滿。故勝利後棉農多自動恢復植棉，增產棉花。然復產伊始，去年度又以廉價外棉傾銷關係，浦東棉產，又備受跌價摧殘。棉農以不數成本之棉價求售，竟仍乏買主。所幸近來中國紡建公司，迭曾派員至周浦等處，儘量收購，故棉價照就地土產比價，已稍見跟上。棉農經此番鼓勵後，下種亦較往年踴躍。各區廣植新花，故預計本年度產量，可望豐收。聞紡建公司，對收購貨品，嚴格鑑別等級評價，取締過去攙雜之陋習。棉農棉商，對此亦頗樂於接受，均已自動相率僱工選擇，改善積弊，以岡復興浦東之棉產云。</p>
<h3>中信局籌劃　乘客保險</h3>
<p>保額最低兩千萬</p>
<p>中央信託局保險處，除積極推進人壽保險及產物保險外，近又籌備創辦，乘客保險，几旅客乘坐飛機輪船火車及長途汽車等交通工具，爲避免意外之危險，均可向該局請求保險，保額最低爲國幣二千萬元，保費二萬元。旅客一經保險，途中如遇危險或傷亡等情，其家屬即可向該局領取賠償。該局因此種保險範圍甚廣，遍及全國，非資本微弱之保險公司可以勝任，故擬聯合全國各地保險公司共同組織一大集團經營。倘再有多餘之保額時，尙可採取互惠方式與英美瑞士等國分做。惟此種「乘客保險」與「產物保險」性質絕對不同，故必須與產物保險分列辦理云。</p>
<h3>上海鹽務剪影　產運銷緝囤</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部上海鹽務辦事處處長楊隆祜，頃接見本報記者，就該處業務情形分述概况如次。渠稱：該處經常業務，不外產，運，銷，緝四種，附帶業務囤一種。</p>
<p>產鹽方面，主要者有袁浦塲產鹽。該塲係三鹽塲合併而成，淡月產四五千担，旺月可產八九萬祖。現因該塲產鹽品質不佳，成本貴而產額少，滷水亦淡，故業已限制生產。</p>
<p>運鹽方面，共分二種：一係商運商銷，一係官運商銷。本區每月平均運鹽十萬担之總額中，袁浦塲佔二萬担，華北鹽業公司佔二萬担，其餘六萬祖，則分由浙江餘姚等地運來。十萬祖總額中，商運佔百分之八十。</p>
<p>銷鹽方面，純採自由貿易制度。故對鹽商運銷之食鹽價格，並不管制。惟官運之鹽，則定有官倉價，目前每祖連稅爲六萬元，商運鹽目前每担約合七萬五千元。銷鹽數量，去年七月至十二月份，總額達八十八萬担。本年一月至四月份，總額違五十一萬四千担。逐月平均銷鹽額，均已超一過十萬担之比額。</p>
<p>緝鹽方面，由逐月平均銷　額超過比額一點而言，巳足證私鹽雖仍存在，惟數額已不多。統計去年七月至十二月份，緝獲私鹽共九千二百担。本年一月至四月份，緝獲私鹽共二千八百担。</p>
<p>附帶之囤鹽業務，即官運之「常平鹽』，囤儲官倉，爲遇市面鹽價波動，供求不平衡時，則平價拋售，以資調劑盈虛。例如去年因浙江一帶產鹽不豐，乃分由台灣靑島天津等地，採辦「常平鹽」來滬，以補不足。他如各地鹽商運鹽經過本區，至揚子五岸各區者，該處亦代辦鹽貸事務云。</p>
<h3>捲烟平疲</h3>
<p>昨日香烟市況腳地尙堅，大英牌初爲七百三十萬元，間有做開，旋見微昂，中途頗有轉賣，喊價回市。午收價爲，七百三十萬元，軋升三萬元。其餘華商各牌捲烟，市情亦頗堅固，迨後又聞老刀牌烟漢口來回籠貨不少，塲中已有暗中拋售，是以烟市一時難望着好。</p>
<h3>皂燭原料銷暢</h3>
<p>昨皂燭原料因各方進取，行情挺升。月牌燒碱步堅至七百三十萬元，美貨亦跟升至七百十萬元，俱比上日軋好十五萬元。N松香漲二萬元，每聽價爲六十萬元。白蠟亦昂十萬元，每司馬担爲一百卅萬元。司的令升二十萬元，每市担爲三百二十萬元。</p>
<h3>國外市價相繼報跌　桐猪鬃出口困難　外匯黑市差價擴大促進桐油走私</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據出口業中人談：目前桐油猪鬃之出口，顯已陷於不景氣狀態中。而國外市價仍頻頻報跌，以本市桐油市價言，每祖（一一〇磅）合國幣五十萬元。惟美國市價，每磅近報美金二角五分，合本地市價，僅卅三萬元一担。可知價格相去過鉅，商人實無法推動外銷。即中國植物油廠，桐油之外銷業務，亦已停頓達二月之久。猪鬃方面，上海之市價，合國幣四百萬元一老担（合一三三·三三磅），而以國外市價折算，每老担僅合國幣三百萬元，價格相去亦大。</p>
<p>渠復指出：近來黑市外匯與官價外匯差價日益擴大，無形中亦使該項出口物資之國內外市價差額，日益增加。且更造成桐油走私，爲唯一有利之途。聞走私之桐油，大多來自湘西洪江，辰州等地。該區產量頗豐，產品大多取早路繞道至桂林，復由西江運至廣州，由此取道走私香港。聞抵穗時成本，每担已合國幣四十萬元以上。運港後雖仍以每磅美金二角五分之價成交，惟以黑市外匯結款關係，每担仍可對本對利。據估計，該項走私至香港之桐油，每月至少在千噸以上云。</p>
<h3>台幣滙率　今後將隨時調整</h3>
<p>台灣省政府，今後對於台幣匯率，將隨時予以合理之調整。</p>
<p>又訊，台北郵局前經開放省外匯兌以來，規定每人匯款以台幣一百萬元爲限。據悉此種限制，現已取消。每日匯款總額無限制，惟每張票面最高額不得超過台幣一百萬元。匯費爲百分之五，電匯則另加電報質約百元左右。</p>
<h3>論配給制度</h3>
<p>— 洪丈里</p>
<p>當前物價的病根，錯縱複雜，但物資管制的欠善，也是重要原因，所謂不患寡而患不均。朝野人士受了物價的敎訓，體味到加强管制，在目前是急切需要的。配給制度是整個管制中相當重要的一環，辦得澈底，自然是抑制物價的妥善辦法。</p>
<p>欲求配給制度產生預期的效果，則必須具備下述幾個條件。第一。爲了節制消費，所定的量得低於平時的需要量，但必須接近實際的需要量。第二·不僅要定量，而且要定期。第三·不僅要定期，而且要劃一的品質，否則配給如量少，質劣而時常愆期，人民就不能藉以生存，黑市也就無法消滅。其次，配給的物資必須有一個公定價格來替代自由經濟下的競爭價格，而要求公定價格的合理，必須定價的標準接近生產成本，再加上合理的利潤；應該要相當的穩定，不能朝定夕改。否則公定價格將成爲具文而管制的使命也就難以完成了。</p>
<p>按配給方法，先進國行之有素者，計有四種：（一）禁止制，即禁止其自由製造或消費；（二）限制制，即限制其消費之數量；（三）許可制，即事先須得管轄官署之許可；（四）票券簿摺領配制，亦即定量分配制。論其功效，其一，實族配給制度，可以補救求過於供之物資　　，蓋施行此制，則消費自然限制，且可將資力集中於生產部門，以求生產之增加，其二，可以避免物資偏在，及利潤獨佔之弊，蓋生產販運等一切經濟機能統受國家之監督或營運，商人自然難以居奇壟斷，獲得暴利；其三，可以消滅投機，蓋日用品果能全盤實施配給制度，則獵取暴利之主要對象消失，投機者自難施技，其四，可以使人民生活安定；其五，可以免除經濟競爭，藍物價旣然親定，物資供求旣受限制，則因競爭招致之經濟損失自然可免。不過所列優點，是假定此制能够完善的實行而言。我國則人口與物產既無精確調査統計資料，可爲根據生產消費，都在模糊印象中，有錢有勢的任意享受，多數窮困的人，餓肚皮沒飯吃，此爲衆所共知之事實。因日用品配給祗限於一部而配給數量又少，一般人民所需，多數取給於黑市，而配給的優點便無從發揮出來。</p>
<p>針對當前的種種情形，要謀改正之道，除實施上述必須具備的幾個條件外，還得有通盤的計劃，澈底的辦法，要做到上下一致，有錢有權的不能多買，無錢無勢的照樣得到。並從調整配給機構加强人事管理與推行配給券制度做起，一切以公平合理爲原則，如此則所得雖寡而均，雖貧而安，不祖物價穩定有望，即對當前亂動的局勢，也會寗靜下來。</p>
<h3>煤斤生產消費　各區配合現狀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕有關方面正考慮採必要措施，準備萬一華北煤斤之供給斷絕時，華中能自足自給。目前生產區與消費區之配合如下：秦皇島及東北之煤礦，供給平津以外之華北各地。基隆之煤供給上海，福州，厦門，及廣州區。一部份棄皇島及基隆之煤斤，經靑島轉口，供京滬杭區域電廠及其他公用事業之用。</p>
<p>北方之主要困難，爲軍運繁忙車皮缺乏，同時共軍時時切斷煤礦與港口間之交通綫，致煤斤之南運，常不能達預期數額。惟現有兩種好現象；一爲基隆煤礦經二二八事變，已逐漸恢復；二爲淮南煤礦經開發後，產量激增。如能提高至每月十萬噸以上，則華中區即可自足，不必仰賴北方</p>
<h3>大豆出口暫停　義大利除外</h3>
<p>大豆出口，中信局正分別與各需要國家接洽中。義大利所需之一萬三千二百噸，已於本月初運出半數，其餘六千六百噸，限本月底前裝出。瑞士捷克等其他國家所需要者，在油類及原料實施辦法未公佈前，一律停辦。</p>
<h3>東北大豆運抵滬　將分配各榨油廠</h3>
<p>市府爲抑平目前食油漲風，設法疏通油源，業與中糧公司洽妥，該公司自東北採購大豆運滬時，一部份需供應本市。該公司現有大豆七百五十噸，已於日前運抵此間，將由市府對各榨油廠作合理之分配云。</p>
<h3>工商輔導處續商　日賠工廠問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工商輔導處前日召開會議，由民營工廠代表出席，就承辦日本賠償工廠事續作商討。現全國商聯會之籌備代表八人，已於前日全部推出。工協上海總會之代表，據田和鄕氏表示，可於下週內產生，惟各地分會代表名單，產生尙有時日。經濟部方面原希望聯合工廠組織工作，能於本月內完成，但依目前情形而論，勢必延期。承辦所需之資金，在兩個月之前估計每廠即需國幣一千億，四廠共計四千億；今日百物騰貴，當已遠不止此數矣。民廠代表現堅持建廠之前，須派代表赴日視察預定搬回之賠償機器，以確定其價値及效能。</p>
<h3>美通知定期舉行　機器工具展覽會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕駐滬美國總領事館頃函上海市商會：略謂美國機器工具製造廠定本年九月十七日至廿六日，於芝加哥舉行規模空前之機器工具展覽會，舉凡美國工業在戰時之各種進步，均將充分表演。展覽會之地點偕用道奇芝加哥　，佔地四萬四千平方米之多，此廠於戰時建立，乃專門製造飛機引擎者，爲美國規模最大飛機廠之一。預備展覽之機器在二百五十類以上，每類再分出若干種，以大規模生產之特種機器爲主體。展覽會開幕後，希望我國各界代表前往參觀。</p>
<h3>各地商情</h3>

<h3>徐兗段　從千瘡百孔一波三折中走向新生</h3>
<p>— 兗州十四日快訊　本報訊者凌松壽</p>
<p>面對整魯中戰事的廣開，不論從任何一個角度來看，津浦路徐兗段的通車，該是舉國所關切的事。記者此次率派北行，主要的任務便是來看這段路的搶修槪况。</p>
<p>提起這段路的搶修，我們先得體味一下共軍過去對這段路的一番手段。勝利後，共軍出馬第一砲，就先破壞鐵路。</p>
<p>修復工作　三次不斷展開</p>
<p>在財政艱窘之際，政府始終不忘復與工作，帶着沉痛的心情，於三十四年十一月間先對津浦路開始搶修。從利國驛起，向北開工，到十二月間達到韓莊站。這時共軍慌了，他們認爲鐵路的修復，對他們是比槍口對準着胸膛還要危險的事，不到三天，便重行　壞。美方交涉之後，共軍認了不是，搶修隊再從利國驛起作第二次之搶修。到了三十五年一月間，正是國共雙方協議成立，國府頒布停戰命令的前幾天，鐵路已經修復到臨城，而共軍硬阻不准接軌，折衝無效，路局員工，乃返徐待命。停戰命令過止不住共軍的軍事野心，一紙公文，反促成了共軍在各個地區的戰燄怒發，剛修好幾個月的徐臨間鐵道，於五月間竟遭到了共軍第三次破壞。</p>
<p>政府忍讓爲國，謀取和平解決，向共方協商，於七月二十日，路局第三次展開修復工作。這次，費了五個月的時閒，修到臨城，幷且把三十一公里長的臨棗支綫也修復通軍。爲時約一個月，一列一列的火車，運出了若干噸的黑煤。好景不常，當沿鐵路兩旁的居民，才開始覺得有點兒生氣的時候，今年一月，共軍復以强大的兵力，攻陷棗莊。臨徐綫雖因九十七軍之堅守臨城，得以倖免於第四次的破壞，然而臨棗支綫，衹剩下了斷斷缺缺的路基，直到現在，還是支離破碎地放在那兒。</p>
<p>搶修困難　宛如重舖新路</p>
<p>叛徒的一切暴行，迫使政府不得不以武力來做和平統一的後盾了。幾個月來，魯省局勢，漸吿開朗，而徐濟綫之打通，復使徐兗間之通車，形成交通當局的一個主要課題。</p>
<p>記者到徐州，晤見主持搶修工作的朱兼隊長咸賓（路局工程處處長）。到滕縣，又碰到兼隊長陸頌康（路局工程司）。承兩位在緊張的工作之中，吿訴了記者關於搶修的一切</p>
<p>因為破壞得太兇了，他們兩位一致認爲搶修工作，無異在舖一條新路。這段路（指臨城至兗州）車站在外，全長九十六公里，鐵橋有六十一座，計一百四十三孔，最長的橋長達二六〇米。</p>
<p>開始動工時，因沿途民工之有無，沒有把握，所以除去老工人四百九十餘人外，先在徐州雇了五千人。其後到滕縣時，該縣縣政府撥了二千人，鄒縣縣政府也征集了三千多人加入工作。工作最緊張時，每天達一萬二千多人。現在逐漸淘汰，老工人以外，還有基本工人一千多，臨時雇工一千多。</p>
<p>需用器械　部方路局合籌</p>
<p>器材方面，接收以後就開始陸續準備到百分之八十以上，現在到兗州的器材，已不成問題了。全部所需器材，據統計：（一）鋼軌　一九〇七六根。（二）魚尾板　三八一五二塊。（三）魚尾螺絲釘　七六三〇四個。（四）枕木　一七四三一二根（內橋樑用三一二四二根）。（五）道釘　五七二二八〇個。（六）道岔　三一付。</p>
<p>鋼軌和枕木由交通部撥發，其餘則由路局籌辦。比較困難的是魚尾板（即夾板），因爲部方發下的鋼軌，大小式樣並不一致，魚尾板必須依據鋼軌的尺寸才能配合，所以領到一部份鋼軌，就配製一部份魚尾板。鋼軌的數字中有五分之一是出價收集得來的，因爲共軍破壞之後，大都塊藏在二十公里以內的地區，這樣出一點價値，使民衆看見了就送來，也算是一舉兩得的事。</p>
<p>天黑以前　必須回站休息</p>
<p>工作方面現在所感到困難的，第一是治安的不穩固，所以工作人員，必須在天黑以前回到大站休息。一淸早五時就出發，而來回的行程即花費八小時（剛修復的鐵路上，車行速度每小時不能超過十公里），實際工作的時間，已僅剩七八小時了。第二是路剛修好，股道很少，而軍運特多有時反妨碍材料軍的行動。其餘如時間的忽促，器材的雜而且舊，都是搶修所感到頭痛的事。然而全體工作人員，在如此的環境之下，不避風沙烈日，終究表現出下列的成績：（一）運了五十萬公方的土，把路基早就鋪好。（二）每天工作的效率，最高達二·五五公里。（三）迄至目前爲止，已剩下鄒縣至兗州南十多公里的空隙，而能在軍方提早十天限期——本月二十日以前可以通車了。</p>
<p>軍方提早了十天的限期，但也顧及到路局方面的困難，另調鐵道兵團第×團第×營和第×團第×營兩個營的一部由兗州出發，向南搶修。並調同團第×營第×營兩個營負責路局搶修隊的警戒，俾能安心工作，延長工作時間，而增加工作效率。十二日，記者隨同第五區鐵道軍運指揮部總指揮陳紹平中將乘路局專車，赴上述兩部份的工作地點視察。同行者有路局朱隊長咸賓，陸副隊長頌康，石工程師代卓等。一行十三人。先抵兩下店。下車以後，首先觸到眼簾的是路局兩大列材料軍，滿滿地裝着枕木和鋼軌。再前面，則是一堆堆的工作者，在推，在敲，在鎚，在打，在量，在呌，……記者被這一幅用「力」寫成的畫圖吸引住了。我馬上跑過去，脚一步步地踏到剛舖好的枕木上，覺得漆了不少的勁。</p>
<p>修路步驟　從初步工作起</p>
<p>關於修路工作步驟方面：第一步是先在築好的路基上舖起枕木。枕木從材料車上裝上汽車，運到工作地點，再用人工舖好，每根枕木間的距離約爲七十五生的。次一步的工作，則是裝着鋼軌的工程車，在若干人的着力之下，推到誧軌的地段。由一個人發出「哼……呀……呵……　」的歌聲，許多熟練的工人將一根重四百八十磅的鋼軌，迅速地從車上拉向前面，等到快要離車落地的時候，另外有一位人專司以一根鐵棒向軌的末端一敲，這一下，最緊張，也最有味兒，十多個人一齊放手，鋼軌落到枕木上，恰巧和後面的一條軌啣接起來。當你聽到他們的歌聲唱得最起勁的時候，那就是說：他們又僅以二三分鐘的短時間，舖下一條鋼軌了。舖完兩根，工程車隨即滾上了這剛舖下的兩根軌，再繼續他們的工作，而後面釘道的工人又趕上來了。在釘道之前，先要測量一下兩軌間是否平行，標準之後，釘上一部份的道釘，而上夾板，再補釘道釘，以後便是撥正，撥平，塡石子等等的養路工作。</p>
<p>火車一通　俺也乙有辦法</p>
<p>記者找到一個雇工，問他「辛苦不辛苦？」他說：「你老別問啦。別講公家還有錢給俺，沒有錢，也得幹！火車一通，俺也有辦法了！」接着，他吿訴記者：兩年前共軍如何地集合數千人，一聲號令，一齊動手，把一段段的鋼軌，拋到河中，一根根的枕木，放火燒掉……看着他做。「然而今天，又畢竟在我們手裏修好了！」這是他最後最高具的一句話。</p>
<p>我們一行，再向北是，通過了幾座鐵橋，橋上雖有枕木架着，可是下臨深淵，記者懾懦着未敢前進。後由三位戴着眼鏡的營長……趙·邱·兪·遞次扶着記者走過。隨後上了汽車，赴鄒縣午餐，餐後，到了鐵道兵團的搶修工作的地點：楊家巷。</p>
<p>共軍拆路　根本不想回來</p>
<p>這兒距兗州七公里，因爲兗州的堅守未陷，所以破壞的程度，表面上不甚劇烈。大概的情况是這樣：兗州以南三公里內，軌道完好無損；三公里以下至十一里以內的這一段地區，鋼軌挖起，但未搬走，枕木則全部失蹤，路基尙未全壞。不過，共軍的破壞工作，一向是研究有素的，這一段路雖以限於環境破壞未能澈底；但他幷不曾放鬆過去，他把路基兩旁，相間地挖成一個傾斜面。這樣，縱使修復，也會因路基土質的鬆緊不等，而要時常出毛病。　　呢，他把接縫處夾板上螺絲釘的旋紋破壞或把鋼軌兩端的釘　炸毀。照常一個辦法，使你必得用一個大的力量，以釘帽向釘身重新擠出旋紋來，甚至要把釘身截斷，才能拆下應用。照第二個辦法，則鋼軌雖在，等於廢物。如此一做，也就和澈底破攘差不多了。陳指揮官笑着說：「我們抗戰時也曾破讓過鐵路，然而可不曾像他們這樣地破壞得周到，和做得澈底！」記者插上一句：「我們那時破讓］是還想再回來應用的呀，他們破途了，壓根兒就不想回來了！」</p>
<p>倪仲黎營長刻兼該團搶修隊隊長，主持此間搶修事宜。記者和他暢談了一下。他吿訴記者在這兒工作的許多困難。這邊的破壞雖輕，但修復起來，其麻煩的程度也和錶平了的地方差不多。先要把鋼軌拆下來，拆一根，至少得半個鐘點。再把路基上殘餘的碎石撥開，才開始舖枕木，上軌道……等等的工作。加以材料的運輸又有許多不便，這裏所用的枕木，是向兩下店路局搶修隊方面去領運的。十一輛汽車，只有五輛好用，平均每輛每天可運一百根。另外有牛車二百輛，每三天一個來復，每輛可裝十根，總算起來，每天最多裝運一千多根沈木。但是，　預定的計劃，這裏每天要修一·五公里，舖軌一五〇根，每根鋼軌配合枕木十四根，共需枕木二一〇〇根。此外，還有四座橋樑，需要八千根做橋基。雖然有這樣許多難處，倪營長仍很樂觀，他正想着別的方法來加强運輸工作，務使達到預期目標，能在二十日以前修復完成，接軌通車。</p>
<p>這一個搶修單位，過去在臨棗支綫上曾經工作過，其後在隴海綫上修復到新安鎭，這次抽調到此間來工作。據倪營長相吿，短期內仍可能再到隴海綫搶修，記者已約定如果開始工作，請通知我去參觀。</p>
<p>天氣很熱，汗出如漿，記者拿起水桶裏的大葫蘆，舀起水來，連盡數下。這時同來的，除倪營長外，都已返兩下店了。記者因赴兗州，便偕倪營長步行向北，彳亍於未經破壞的路軌之上，竟發現綠草蓬生，亦足以想見兩年來的長門風雨，鐵路也嚐盡了冷落的滋味了！夕陽在山，歸鴉陣陣，雖然帶着凄寂的氣氛，可是前面的人聲，鐵聲，汽車聲，嘈雜聲……打成一片，正爲這條路注射着血液，猛烈地劃破了這長期間的落寞。</p>

<h3>東北大學生流亡圖</h3>
<p>— 長春十五日航訊　本報記者趙展</p>
<p>在東北米珠薪桂的時候，很多松北共區的靑年學生，陸續由戰爭的夾縫中逃出來。他們逃出後，曾得到吉林省府發給每人兩千元的救濟費，以後便沒有人過問了。大部份流浪到瀋陽，國立大學早拒之於門外，靑年升學就業輔導委員會也沒有辦法。他們作了難民，有時候到行總東北分署去討要，現在行總的大門也關起來了。他們已感到呼籲無門，前路茫茫，便又流浪到長春來試一試命運。</p>
<p>一幢屋兩頓粥</p>
<p>靑年團借給他們一所房子，每天兩頓高粱米粥，靠市政府發動各界施捨。雖然這是一個可憐的茍活機遇，但在他們嚐試了最慘的流浪生活之後，覺得茍活也是出路了。　到目前爲止，集中在長春的流亡大學生已達八百八十人，內中有女生九十七名，他們都是僞滿時代專科以上學校的學生。他們來自七十一偭不同的學校。有些在日本讀書，如早稻田大學，東京法政大學，東京明洽大學，東京日本大學，新瀉醫科大學，仙台高等工業以及被原子彈毁減了的廣島女子專科等三十二個單位的學生，以學校單位來說，在日本的學校佔二分之一。但以偽滿學校讀書的人數，則佔三分之二，有奉天工大，新京法政大學，旅順工大，大連經專，哈爾濱農大，佳木斯醫大，及吉林師大等三十七個學校。在八百八十人中，有少數同學不是松北逃來的學生，還有八個是僞北大，二個是僞華北法政學院的學生。流亡者的數目是不固定的，陸續有流亡學生來報到。他們成立了一個流亡失學大學生聯合會，團結起來，集中力量，共求生存。</p>
<p>十粒米一滴血</p>
<p>他們從戰區中來，受到艱苦生活的考騐，可以說他們生活在飢寒的可憐狀態中。有四百二十五人住在一所三層樓房裏，過着痛苦而嚴肅的生活，夜間和衣往地下一滾，很少有一個有一條毯子和棉被，女生也是如此。沒有人抱怨得不到溫暖的好夢。早晨六時起床，升旗然後至公園跑步。一天吃兩頓稀飯，即沸水也沒得吃。他們喝冷水，也喝下疾病的菌毒。有的同學在這種生活條件下病倒了。他們以痛苦的生活經騐警惕着自己，在祗有稀飯吃的時候，他們在餐廳的壁上寫着：「有飯吃，勿忘無米時」的警句。「十粒米，一滴血，」這又是多麽精確的計算啊！</p>
<p>有一部份學生暫時找到糊口的職業，如小學敎員，公務員，以及報阪等，他們只能找到廉價出賣勞力的工作。以所拿到報酬，作僞流亡失學大學生聯合會的公費</p>
<p>想學校想書本</p>
<p>學生唯一的要求是進學校，有書讀，這實在是很正當的要求。敎育當局竟未能籌得相當辦法。靑年升學就業輔導委員會的一位專員，把他們的名册拿走，便一直沒有下文。他們不願等待着而荒廢學業，便決定自己成立一個補習班，由同學們成立的聯合會負責籌劃，擬於短期內實現。補習期間四月，所需經費，計流通券約二億元。這一筆龐大的經費何處來呢？他們決定了勸募的辦法，要求長市各界拿出偉大的同情心來帮助他們。效果怎樣還難說，不過他們的呼聲確能得到深厚的同情。他們說：「敎師自己請，房子自己找，同學們席地而上課，我們決心幹起來。」他們要求與論界聲援，在他們深沉憂鬰的眼睛裏含着眼淚，衷心地傾訴他們殷切的志願，希望抓住記者渡河，正如抓住了一根稻草。我在同情與慚愧之下，寄語改組後的新政府，不給他們飯吃，不給他們書讀，是政府的恥辱，政府應負責任。</p>

<h3>希望交大分設考區</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>暑假將到了，在我們之一羣高中畢業生，那一個不是懷着一顆熱烈的心，希望能夠考進一個理想的大學，云求深造，但是事實上，我們的困難是很多的。</p>
<p>上海的交通大學，是我國最有名理工學府之一，也就是我們理想的大學，我們都希望能够參加投考，但是據說上海交大還是按照往例，今夏招生只有上海一個考區，但是從北方到上海，照目前交通狀態，的確是一件不容易的事，籌措這一筆的旅費，在我們的窮學生看來，根本就是一件不可能的事。</p>
<p>再說；平津一帶，素來有「文化城」之稱，中學的數目確是相當多，再加上河北與東北一帶，恐怕中學的數目要比上海還要多幾倍，所以照理說，交大應該在北平（或津）設一考區，使這數以萬計的華北高中畢業生，都能够得到投考「交大』的機會，因爲國家的設立大學是爲着全國靑年着想的，並不是專是爲着某一區域或且其他有錢階級着想，以理，文，法，商著名國內的淸華，北大，南開三校，今年將準備廣設九考區，也就是爲着這個意思，所以我們謹以十二萬分的熱忱，希望交大能够改變往例，在北平（或天津）設一考區，則我們這一大羣的學生將受益不淺！北平讀者張懷忠，李俊藩，袁禮成。</p>
<h3>房租付米不勝負担</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>鄙人原住重慶南路，在云年五月間，因被二房東利用勢力，張迫遷讓，一時急於覓屋，乃租得龍華區平房一間，租金按月食米一石，（去年五月米價五萬餘元）當時並未訂立租　契約，亦無房票等據。嗣後按月房東要米，則購米付給，有時要現金，則照食米市價折付。去年米價穩定，尙無問題，今年則波動甚烈，刻已暴漲至三十萬大關，鄙人係一工廠職員，收入有限，處此情形之下，殊有不勝負担之苦，爰特奉函，懇借</p>
<p>貴報一角，予以被露，促請能華區公所，主持公道，指示解決下列數點，（一）龍　區租屋，巳往多以食米計算，似不合理，但取消改計租金，以積重難返，亦不可能，可否由區公所，定一房租米價格？以顧全房客爲原則，較官價抵廉，公布執行。（二）如房東未能同意房租米價格，則准照當局公布之官價米（即戶口米）計算。（三）絕對不許以黑市米價折付房租，使房客有蘇息之餘地。以上數點議定辦法後，即行通吿辦理。（龍華區一公民）</p>
<h3>旅行莫忘携身份證</h3>
<p>昨日有事往羅店經大塲，即有憲兵上車檢査，須將各人身份證取出檢閱，鄙人忘未携帶幸憲兵原諒，僅囑下次注意，上次蘇州宿店亦如此，用特奉吿各位讀者，旅行外埠或郊外地方，切勿忘帶本人國民身份證，以省麻煩爲要。（蔡苗聖）</p>
<h3>代郵　復桃源縣趙</h3>
<p>繼珍君：來函爲故父卹金有所申請一則，頃得聯合勤務總司令部撫卹處復稱：「査故員趙至明遺族趙繼珍，前呈送前軍委會撫卹委員會駐湘撫卹處請卹案件，業經本處淸理原案，於四月六日簽發卹金支付書，連同原卹金，逕寄該遺族査收具領矣。』特達。</p>
<h3>西子初夏</h3>
<p>— 杭州廿日快訊　本報特派員儲裕生</p>
<p>春已老去，楊花從西子湖四週的柳樹，飄落到每一條游艇上。桐　花飛舞臺，把湖濱公園染成了皚皚的白色。今年的春雨似乎不太多，一轉眼天已施展了熱浪，太陽已不為人們所喜愛，蘇堤白堤上的樹綠得更深。白天，廣闊的湖面上閃耀着片片金麟。入晚，人推着人在湖濱閒散，直到深夜還不忍離去。這已是初夏天氣，熟得令人難耐，檢査寒暑表，已到了九十度的指標。恐怕今年的夏天，是個苦的熱氣候。</p>
<p>不斷的浪潮　應轉變為建設主力</p>
<p>因着春雨稀疏，杭嘉湖一帶的麥，收成倒還好，而荳的收成差了，早稻也差了。蠶，因爲配給的雲南種，溫度不够，多半死了。急謀補救的結果，恐不如理想的好。我們在這炎熱的夏天來臨的時候，想一想，冒着盛暑，不怕酷熱，胼手胝足的善良農胞們，在全國動盪不安的景象中，還是忠於他們的職守。我們這安靜的風景城，另外許多人，激起了陣陣的波瀾，米風潮過後，英大，浙大，之大，還有一些零星的工潮。這許多現象，當是象徵着時代的風風雨雨，以及對進步建設的渴求。誠如司徒雷登所說：「中國數十年來，年年在破壞，現在我們需要的是建設的革命。」建設的前提是安定，安定的前提是尋求解決問題的途徑。</p>
<p>夏天來了，祈望這許多浪潮　變爲建設的主力。看那千萬農　他們還是辛勤的墨守成規的勞働着，他們需要新的浪潮去灌漑，他們需要新的建設，我們再不能讓城市與鄕村脫節，再不能使其間有一條很深的鴻溝。</p>
<p>夏天的西子　在暮色中開始活動</p>
<p>雖然天氣漸漸熱起來了，天堂也感着有不安的現象。但是到杭州來玩的人還是很多，各旅店還掛着客滿的牌子。只是划子生意，白天淸淡了許多，入晚，生意反較熱鬧。第六公園的湖濱茶室一與平湖秋月的茶室，人是這樣的擁擠着，放鶴亭的茶室，若茶也要賣二千元一杯，因爲到那裏去納凉的人也多起來了。靑年館裏正計劃着放映露天電影。夜花園又要開設起來了。夏之西子，是在暮色中開始了活動，一直到深沉的夜晚才慢慢地靜下來。</p>
<p>夏未禁冷飮　過云笑話慎弗再鬧</p>
<p>在這初夏季節，印度梅農大使來杭州玩過，白部農崇禧也躭了五六天，尼泊爾訪華團也來杭州遊覽。杭州的市政府又是二十週年紀念，在湖濱第六公園築一亭，以表追懷以往歷屆主特市政者的意思。我們希望主持市政者不僅注意到風景區，而且要爲整個杭州的市民造福。現在湖濱和主要的幾條馬路雖然比較整潔，但是許多小街僻巷的住宅區，在這夏天來臨的時候，汚穢的臭氣泛溢出來，使人聞了會生病的。並且醫藥衛生，實在還不够進步，一般普通的住戶，還是飲着「天落水」。杭州神的勢力與許多未經考核過的中醫的繁興，這證明新的醫藥的衛生不够普及。炎夏來了，很多時疫病要叢生起來，今年春季雨水不多，可能潛伏着很多的病菌。我們這個國家往往亡羊補牢，對於時疫病的防範，大多都是臨渴掘井的，現在我們要　籲衛生當局，請趕快作種種預防疫癘的宣傳，同時，即日起，開始注射防疫針，即日起，設立檢疫站，關於疫病的情報更要絕對準確，庶可撲滅疫病的亂源。對於冷飲，也必須要事先加以指示與檢核，不要再像去年樣的，一直到夏末，才禁止冷飲，結果鬧了一塲笑話。</p>
<p>裏西湖美景　巨大荷掌伸出湖面</p>
<p>這幾天來，裏西湖的荷已在萌生了，一片片還不甚鉅大的荷掌已伸出在湖面。西子是四季都美的，那麽夏天的美，當以荷花作爲主要的點綴。再稍隔些時，外湖裏湖的菱角也要出生了，當舟子划過菱蔓，拉一把，便有一串菱角可以供你咀嚼。在太陽尙未升起的早晨，可駕一葉划子，去到裏湖，或是岳王墳前，或是三潭印月，或是劉莊，欣賞這芬芳馥郁的荷花，也是够有意思的。當你的小舟闖進了荷叢，一股股薰人的香味使你陶醉，使你忘記了爭奪不已的世界。</p>
<p>有人說，杭州的夏是够熱的，是的，杭州確是相當的熱，但如果你能小住在小瀛洲，或是靈峯寺裏，或是龍井寺，或是烟霞洞，也是够凉快的。吿訴你，當年胡適博士，他就曾在烟霞洞旁住過一個夏天的。</p>

<h3>懷念曲——獻給我最尊敬的朋友JS</h3>
<p>— 楊依芙</p>
<p>那昔日的戀情，曾經在我底靈魂的深處，刻劃下悲哀的光痕，晶瑩地閃爍着。我永不會忘懷那一串如夢的逝去的日子…淸曉兆豐花園中的細語，黄昏善鐘路上的漫步，深夜太達飯店裏聽懷念曲，聖誕節燭光下的舞會，敎堂聖母像前的祈禱，夜色迷濛中的吻別，……這烟雲般的往事；這夢魂中的影子，緊緊地緊繞着我的心靈，——讓我在沉思中靜靜的神往；想念裏悄悄的惆悵；回憶時默默的落淚。記不淸有多少次我曾下意識地對自己說：『忘記了它吧！我們活着是爲今天，而不是爲過去。」然而，誰又能忘掉憂鬱如忘掉歡樂一樣的容易呢？</p>
<p>黄昏的時候，街頭異常的冷落，我獨自慢慢的從學校踱回家去。不解人意的東風，輕輕地在吹拂着，一陣又一陣地吹拂着我肩上的散髮，使我驟然感到一陣莫名的惆悵，一陣無端的薄愁，……誰說這不是「多情却被無情惱」呢，暮色漸漸的濃了，一切的景物，都在晚烟暝色中糢糊下去。</p>
<p>回到家裏，把書放下，我便發見書桌上的玻璃板下壓着一張條子，那熟識的字跡，一望便知道是舅舅寫的：「工作忙得怎麽樣？身體好點麼？今天請你吃晚飯如何？地點恕我暫守秘密。小姐，希望今晚能够看見你的笑容，你知道我最怕看見你雙眉深鎖，一笑。準七時再見。」我看完了，不禁笑了起來。</p>
<p>舅舅眞是我唯一的知己，他最瞭解我，當我在最痛苦的時候，他不但給予我許多的安慰，而且還想盡方法使我愉快起來。可是，他是失敗了，我在替他難過，我知道是我辜負了他的好意。但是，我不能否認他確是可愛的，跟他在一起的時候，他能够容許你有絕對的自由，你愛說什麼就說什麼，你愛怎樣就怎樣，祗要你覺得高興，他便好像更高興似的。我喜歡他，因爲他的個性有點和我相像，他不自私，他不以自己的快樂爲快樂，而是以他人的幸福爲幸福。</p>
<p>我欣然把小窗推開，暮色裏，一弦淡月已掛在樹梢。</p>
<p>我走到梳裝台前，塗上薄薄的脂粉，點上淡淡的口紅，便　忙把衣櫃打開，我在考慮我應該穿那一件衣服？我的視綫首先便落在那件淺藍底灑滿了薔薇花的晚服上，不知道究竟有多少時間我沒有穿它了，我不禁把它拿出來，看了一看，然後又悄悄地把它掛好，不，我不願意穿它，因爲他使我想起了華華，這件晚服是他最喜歡的。我把那件銀灰色的拿了下來，心裏想，穿得淡素一點不好麼？</p>
<p>舅舅來了，我便怱忽的上了車，在車裘，我忍不住就問他：「你究竟預備把我帶到什麼地方去呢？」</p>
<p>他笑笑：「等會你就會知道的了。」</p>
<p>車子的速度相當快，一盞盞的路燈不斷地向後飛馳過去。終於，車子停了，我下了車，祗見眼前一片亮光，抬起頭，便看見那耀眼的霓虹燈閃爍着「太達飯店」四個紅色的大字，我驚訝地呆住了：「舅舅，爲什麽到這兒來？……」</p>
<p>「爲什麼？」他說着便拉着我的手，一步步的走上石階：「去聽聰音樂不好麼？」</p>
<p>這一剎那，我眞不知應該怎樣才好，但是，我已不自覺地被他拉了進去，我跟着他走到那張靠着長窗的圓桌旁坐下。舅舅在忙着點菜。我雖然靜靜的坐着，可是，我的思潮却像晚汐一般的洶湧澎湃；這個熟識而又陌生的大廳，依然是那樣的燈光輝煌；這班似曾相識的樂隊，依然在奏着動人心弦的音樂。以前有過一個時期我和華華幾乎每晚都在這裏聽音樂；可是，現在我也不想去計算，究竟有多少日子沒有上這兒來了。雖然，我也曾希望過，有一天我能够再到這兒來，喝杯濃熱的咖啡，或是喝杯甜蜜的葡萄酒，聽一回音樂，回味一下辛酸的往事，可是，我始終沒有這份勇氣。然而，今晚，現在，我已經坐在這兒了，我不能不感到內心的興奮和激動。</p>
<p>驀地，一陣陣淸脆的梵華鈴由音樂台上盪漾開來，這稔熟而又纏綿的旋律，吿訴我，那是「懷念曲」（Souvenir）這一聲聲的弦聲，透入我心靈的深處，幾乎使我的血液都凝住了，這時，我的腦海又浮起了華華的影子。雖然，我極力抑制着自己的情感，但是，我知道我的眼眶是濕潤了</p>
<p>「依芙，你怎麽了？是不是不喜歡這個地方？」我想他一定已經瞥見我的眼角掛着點點的淚珠。</p>
<p>「不，我沒有這個意思，」我避開他的視綫，凝望着遠遠講音樂台，慢慢地說：「這是華華最喜歡的曲子。」</p>
<p>舅舅沒有說話，他沉默了片刻，才低聲地對我說：「傻孩子，還是那樣痴心麽？」</p>
<p>我回過頭來說：「我不知道，也許不能忘記的永遠都不能忘記，」輕聲地：「現在我才知道，去忘掉一件事要比去記住一件事眞是要難得多。」</p>
<p>晚飯開始了，他舉起那杯紫紅色的葡萄酒，碰一碰我的玻璃杯說：「爲你的康健，快樂而祝福。」</p>
<p>「謝謝你。」我　舉起那杯葡萄酒，一飲而盡。</p>
<p>在吃魚的時候，我情不自禁地問他：「華華眞的一點消息都沒有麼？就是這樣永達的失踪，永遠的不回來了麽？」</p>
<p>他燃着了紙烟：「我希望你還是這樣想比較好些，」他吐出一口濃濃的烟氛：「假如你還在愛他。」</p>
<p>「是的，我愛他，」我壓制不住自己的情感，激動地說：「我愛他，雖然現在我已經體會到愛情衹不過是美麗的痛苦，因爲，支付愛的代價還是用愛。」</p>
<p>燈光漸漸的暗淡了，音樂由悠揚凄婉而轉變到輕快嘹亮。微明的燈光下，依稀地我竟瞥見舅舅在凝注着我，他那溫柔的目光，似乎對我說：他同情我。</p>
<p>這時，我相信我的感覺比他還要難過，一陣陣壓不住的哀愁，湧上我的心頭，我恨我自己爲什麼又破壞了這個晚宴的和諧的空氣？</p>
<p>這一刻，我們彼此又沉默了下來，侍者把點心和咖啡端來了，我呷了一口甜蜜而又帶着苦味的咖啡：「舅舅我眞不知應該怎樣的感謝你，」我諦視着他，親切地說：「這許多日子以來，你彷彿是我的明燈，照亮了我的黑暗的路程，你又彷彿是我的淸泉，寬解了我的焦灼的生命。你給我工作，讓我在繁忙中忘記了許多痛苦，讓我把我的愛和熱情寄託在人羣中，使我活得更有意義，更有價値。我記得你會說過：生命是奉獻而不是獲取，今後，我一定要更堅强起來，……」</p>
<p>他微笑地握着我的一雙纎手說：「我知道你是個好孩子，這個世界並不像你想像得那麼壞，它還有快樂，還有幸福，願你永遠做你自己的主人，把你的幸福尋找回來，我的同情也許是多餘的。」</p>
<p>「不，假如這個世界還有一點美麗的話，這一點點的美麗，或許就是溫暖的友情了。」</p>
<p>他笑着點點頭，我也笑着對他說：「你願意我永遠做你許多朋友中的一個麽？」</p>
<p>他把視綫移到窗外，笑笑的說：「請不要忘記，我是不喜歡看見雙眉深鎖的朋友的。」我不禁失聲大笑起來。</p>
<p>燈光暗了又亮，亮了又暗，音樂在奏着Farewell　Waltz，那是一曲充滿了離情的華爾滋，在這黯然銷魂的樂聲中，我們走出了太達飯店。</p>
<p>夜已深，舅舅把我送到家裏已是午夜了。夜鬧人靜，我悄然倚在窗前，銀河隱約，一彎銀月已掛在天邊，悠悠的晚風，一陣又一陣的吹拂着我肩上的散髮，靜極了，突然，彷彿從晚風中飄來了一陣陣淸脆的弦聲，不住地盪漾在我的耳畔——那不是纏綿的「懷念曲」麼？我不禁緊閉着眼睛，默默地在作最摯誠的晚禱，但願今夜的晚風，能够把我的祝福帶到萬里外的西方去。</p>

<h3>夜曲</h3>
<p>— 湯匡瀛</p>
<p>我的失戀</p>
<p>年幼時，我愛戀起門前一彎江水，年靑時，我愛戀起長夜書燈；而今，漸入中年，江水，書燈，雖衹敎略略回憶，還分明在目。可是，千山萬水過來，我這顆愛人類愛天然的心，已給在風巨浪侵蝕得光彩剝落。</p>
<p>而今，我知道愛戀起自己。</p>
<p>「萬人似海一身藏」！</p>
<p>願在海的深處，看浮在水面上的泡沫躦動，我衹重溫這如潮往事，，似水流年。</p>
<p>我是對什麼東西都像有起一份中年人的性情而開始失戀了。</p>
<p>幡影</p>
<p>偶然一陣風動，我的心幡又飄亂了。</p>
<p>是心動？是幟動？東風無語；我這個遠方遊子又給今夜黄昏推入感情的深潭。</p>
<p>重燃起寂寞的心燈，向心幡深處，千百回懺悔與痛恨：我是要把自己作爲一盞人海中的孤燈，照盡人間往往來來飄流在黑夜中的歸航。</p>
<p>我記起佛經中那句：「譬如明燈，能滅諸闇，若與闇俱，不名爲燈」。</p>
<p>打摺心幡，我要在風雨之中撑住這顆微弱的燈光。</p>
<p>荒鷄</p>
<p>枕上，聽荒村鷄呌，忽然想起身是數千里外作客之人了。</p>
<p>沒有像夜深時最使人淸醒了。枕上，把十數年前往事推到眼前，再把十數年後自己移到枕邊，中間數十年間，我不過是一個上帝的囚徒；他只給我一架消化麵包的機器，而我却受了數十年人類的迫害和做了數十年靈魂的俘虜</p>
<p>誰都把最淸澈的時候在黑夜中摸過，又誰都在天明的時候把鷄聲忘了。鷄聲消磨着更多人的生命與活力。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血518</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>守一：「哈，您仍在說孩子話，請翻翻歷史，幾千年來，有哪幾個被侵略的國家或種族，在幾十，或百來年中，不將侵略者同化，反而駕凌他們？紀元前侵略印度的爪哇地族，早已淪落成了印度國的『賤民』，攻奪英國三島的諾曼人，以沾到本地人的血統爲榮。您可知道當初忽必烈轉戰到歐洲沿地中海幾個國家，把軍隊丢下了一部分在那些戰敗國裏，後來都被人家同化了。您如不信，現在在這些國裏，尤其是匈牙利，還有許多元朝的我國子孫，仍舊保留我國許多風俗習慣，可是血統和種族，早被常地民族消化乾凈了。…」</p>
<p>「那麽，您認爲做亡國奴不要緊，過了幾十幾百年就可把侵略國同化，反轉成了勝利者？」鶴見認爲守一的理論，包含着過分的高超性，似乎連亡國都不在乎，所以這麽不客氣的問着；語句裏不免含着幾分高度的譏諷。</p>
<p>守一：「您有些過分誤會，我並不贊成惰性的自己毁滅，我却更不贊成處心積慮的籌備侵略，想滅亡人家的國。一個民族，是絕對不能澌滅的，除非這個民族微小而又墮落到應該受大自然的淘汰。……所以這話應當分開兩面來說；第一面，侵略是無益的；因爲侵略的佔有性，只有幾年，幾十年，最多也不過三幾百年，這侵略的佔有性，就要被那被侵略者積極或消極抵抗或圖存反動力所消滅。這也很合優勝劣敗的定律；因爲武力侵略；或其他性的侵略者，不一定就是優良人種，被侵略的，也不一定就是劣質人種。侵略的形成，只於是一個有了侵略工具的準備和訓練，一個却沒有顧到這一點……</p>
<p>一然而一個民族應當岡强圖存，却是天經地義：圖强，只是要以世界眼光爲範圍，自己做個表率，把世界這不絕如縷的純文化，眞文化，竭盡所能，儘量維繫牠，促進牠。這樣，才能把那些披上了物質文明外袍，而實際是一個自殘同類的野獸，一般的野蠻民族，可以慢慢感化過來，給牠灌輸一些些眞性文化。所以說，圖强並非準備侵略，而也不是準備抵抗侵略。</p>
<p>「爲了圖强圖存，所以應當跟着時代走。時代現在已經走上了科學這條路，所以也應當集中全國的人才物力，來硏究科學，不僅跟在人家後頭，應當邁進一步，走在前頭。不過，這硏究科學的目標，乃是要替人類謀幸福；並不應該像那幾個自私自利的　武集團，好像强盜土匪一般，偸偸地硏究科學武器，然後强横覇道地搶劫人類，毁滅文化……</p>
<h3>白鴿</h3>
<p>— 蔣敦</p>
<p>愛慕那藍天，更愛慕那白色的鴿羣。</p>
<p>想起了那飄舞的藍色的衣角，你，海濱的孩子，像白鴿一樣的美麗一樣的純潔啊！幼夢似的，像海水般湛深的眸子，充滿着靑春的活力，充滿着智慧的光彩，也流露着淡淡的哀愁……那挺秀的鼻子下，有一個含着微笑的口唇像一朶含苞未放的花蕾。披在兩肩波浪形的秀髮，更爲你剪出了一個美麗的面影！想起了您就想到象徵着幸福，和平的白鴿，那披着雲紗的詩的女神——</p>
<p>在一切初戀的愛人們的心中，誰都是一個美麗白鴿，他和她的心就是一片蔚藍天空他們和她們的脈搏中，都可諦聽到「聖母頌」那樣崇高聖潔的旋律。雖然世界是醜陋的，雖然人有着他們的罪惡，但是第一次的愛，都像白鴿似的單純。</p>
<p>藍天，沒有霧的藍天，陽光照耀的藍天，像似我們的心，襯托出我們愛的白鴿更美麗。</p>
<p>在烏黑生活中，我們應該愛慕那藍天，愛慕那白色的鴿羣…</p>
<p>因爲只有愛能使我們的生命更堅强，更光輝，更美！</p>

<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>「反覆無常」是，小人的行爲，</p>
<p>有些所謂君子人，以京派自相標榜，被詞責爲無恥的是「海派」，其實「海派」所重者，是「一言既出，駟馬難追」，是江湖的義氣。</p>
<p>是故，「海」不足病，光棍自己點着自己的鼻子說：「我是光棍」，倒不愧爲快人快語。</p>
<p>最可怕的是那些暗藏居刀自命爲救世主的紳士先生。</p>
<p>S喜歡吃滷鴨子。</p>
<p>我戲謔地說：「我將在你的鼻于上，釘上一枚釘子。然後將滷鴨掛上，沒有事時，可以引舌上舐。既可作爲一種新奇的裝飾。（這和戴耳環的道理，沒有兩樣。）又可時常嚐到你愛吃的東西。」</p>
<p>我這段話，引起了T的謬論，他說：</p>
<p>「有一個怪人，生就了兩隻逈然不同的眼睛，于隻是人眼，另一隻是狗眼。</p>
<p>怪人如　時，他馬上會被引起兩種逈然不同的感覺。人眼看見糞便時，發生厭惡之感，另一隻狗眼，見到大糞，宛比見到　席最美好的佳饌。」</p>
<p>我想如果眞有這樣一個怪人的話，他的嘴巴是最痛苦最矛盾的了。是服從人眼呢？還是依照狗眼呢？</p>
<p>倘若，實際一點地說，當茲米珠薪桂的年頭，還是生就狗眼的人，來得有「福氣」。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>過與不及</h3>
<p>— 華潤</p>
<p>不久一期的生活畫報上，說到美國家庭制度的日趨崩潰，對於西方文明構成嚴重的威脅。原因是美國現在的離婚率，已經達到驚人的高峰：每三次結婚之中，就有一次離婚。離婚的理由，範圍廣大得無以復加。夫婦之間祇要稍有不滿，就可以提出離婚。尤其是妻子方面，對於丈夫任何小疵，都不能忍受。例如有一期時代周報上刊載，有一位年齡五十以上的太太，控吿年齡六十以上的丈夫對她遺棄和虐待，要求離婚。至於遺棄和虐待的罪證，則是老先生在牀上看一本「永遠的琥珀」。還有一位太太，向法院提出控吿。要求離婚，理由是她丈夫稱她爲印弟安人所用的「戰斧」。諸如此類，在世界　他各國都不會構成離婚理由的，在美國却司空見慣，非常普遍。離婚案件一多，遂使性道德根本失去存在，而子女們則從此無福享可貴的家庭敎育。</p>
<p>美國人對於離婚看得如此稀鬆尋常，在我們總覺得太過分了。</p>
<p>可是反過來看看我們自己呢？則又似乎太不够。這就是說，把離婚看得「太重」，因而情願忍受一切的痛苦，甚至因而犧牲了畢生的幸福，夫婦之間，相視如仇寇，直到老死，在這種家庭裏面。子女們也沒有什麽好的家庭敎育可言，他們所得到的祗是怨恨，悲哀，殘酷，以及其他惡毒的不正常的情緒和心理而已。在這種情形之下，同樣也可以把性道德毁滅。</p>
<p>古人看重結髮夫妻的名分，還有「糟糠之妻不下堂」的勸戒，認爲父母之命雞媒之言決定以後，就是天定的烟緣，斷乎不可重行拆散。即使偶有拆散，也是丈夫趕出妻子，其理由大概是她犯了七出之一的罪名。至於女的則嫁鷄隨鷄，嫁狗隨狗，更無自行與丈夫脫離關係的可能。這種風氣直到現在還是極爲流行，遂致養成一種心理，以爲男女倘然離婚，一定是女的有了什麼不是之處，從而招致社會的輕視。至今許多感情不睦的夫婦所以始終不願結婚者，往往是爲了避免女的在這方面所遭遇的損害。經濟的原因，當然也很重要，然而還不是最先考慮的東西。</p>
<p>至於那新式的結合呢？一般人又以爲既是自己互相看中，豈有中途翻悔之理？即使發現性情不合，也不能怪誰，祇好自認活該，準備「白頭偕老」而已。殊不料性情這個東西，極難捉摸，男女之間竟有起初情投意合而終於勢若冰炭不能相容的，這種夫婦如果硬要他們廝守在一起，不但他們自己苦痛，連兒女以至親族鄰居都感到苦痛。</p>
<p>我說上面這番話，當然絕非鼓勵夫婦多多離婚。我的意思無寗說是在結婚以前，應該把交友時間放長一點，結婚以後，應該彼此多所容忍，然而一旦到了萬不能容忍的時候（尤其是女的方面），就應該毅然決然，提出離婚，求一個雙方的解放。</p>

<h3>電寫機</h3>
<p>— 白里</p>
<p>電寫機是由一個發報台和一個收報台所構成的。</p>
<p>發報台是一個二方尺左右的平台，稍微有一些傾側，以便利書寫；平台上有一枝鋼筆，筆上套有兩根鐵條，每條鐵條上附着兩根極靈敏的電線；平台的角上安置了一瓶墨水。</p>
<p>收報台是垂直的，它的構造與發報台大致相同。</p>
<p>電寫機的旁邊裝有一隻普通的電話，不過這架電話是祗能聽而不能對講的。</p>
<p>電寫機的應用是這樣的：首光用電話撥動對方電寫機的號碼。然後在　簡裏跑，如有「岐岐」的聲音，這是表示雙方的電路巳接通，可以開始發報了。如沒有聲音，那就表示另外有人向同一號碼的電寫機發報，你可以稍候數分鐘。</p>
<p>發報之前須在發報台右上角一的電紐上撳一下，便有預備好的紙張從底部捲上來，然後用鋼筆醮了墨水在紙上寫。一張紙寫完，可以再在同一的電紐上撳一下，這樣第二張紙捲上來，你便可以繼續書寫了。發報完畢之後，就須在右下角的電紐上撳一下，紙張便會自動地捲到一隻預備好的木匣裏去，以便發報者的保存。然後再把聽筒放在電話上，這樣，電路便打斷了。</p>
<p>當你在發報台右上角撳一下的時候，對方收報機的底部也有紙張捲上來；你提起筆，對方的收報機也提起筆；你醮墨水，它也醮墨水；你寫字，它也寫字。總之雙方的行動完全一致。當你發報完畢，在右下角的電紐上撳一下，收報機的紙張便落在一個特製的木匣內，俾它的主人回來時拿出來觀看。</p>
<p>電寫機是瑞典人雷脫（Rithes）所發明，後由美國人富蘭克林（Frankin）改造而成。</p>
<p>我們可以先下一個斷語：當電寫機流行到全世界，這正是郵政業務的末日了。</p>
<h3>重建和平神像</h3>
<p>— 葉林</p>
<p>自從和平神像被拆去以後，江海關前就失去了一個最佳的電影鏡頭，而縉紳仕女們也感到似乎缺少了一件擺設似的，很不以為然，至於一般人們，如你我，則女神本非這大都市的重要零件，有沒有也似乎和生活不大相關似的，祇有偶經神像石座，看到遍處鳥屎，像是覺得這里亦像都市的其他部份一樣，已經着蕪起來了。</p>
<p>不久前，聽到女神已被發現，誰都高興，高興的是他幸而沒有東渡成爲黷武者的帮兇，衹是傳聞折翅斷臂，景象十分悽慘，不過究竟女神無知，不如街頭殘廢如乞丐需要同情也，於是久之也就淡忘了。倒是我們的市政當局十分看重這件事情，大概是與市容有關，爲國際觀瞻所繫的緣故吧。近日說是要重建，一筆費用是三億元，換句話說，每個市民要負担七八十塊錢，不够坐一次電車所需，自然是小意思，衹是在市府倒是一個巨大支出了。</p>
<p>自然，這一筆支出雖是巨大，究屬重要大概女神之重建，當可指日而待。一旦落成，則第一上海又多一件漂亮的擺設，二則給人們一點和平的感想，三則顧全國際輿論，至於黄浦灘的生色不少，尤屬餘事衹是希望那些敏感的詩人不要視作諷刺，至於在我們，既不掏腰包，自然樂觀厥成。</p>
<p>戰後各國幣値低落比較觀　健者</p>
<p>在戰時，無窮數的財富化成了灰燼，造成戰後各國的通貨膨脹和貨幣購買力的縮小。無論一元美鈔，一個英鎊或一個法郞，都不能購得像戰前一樣多的東西了。</p>
<p>附圖表示一九四六年底各主要國家貨幣購買力與一九一一一九年（戰前）購買力的百分比。</p>
<p>匈牙利的幣値，將近達到零點。義大利在這次大戰中既做了戰塲，又是失敗國，以致幣値一落千丈。英國因爲勵行統制，情形比較良好，但因物資缺乏，即使有錢，也幾無貨可購之苦。</p>

<h3>「粉紅色的炸彈」</h3>
<p>— 無邊</p>
<p>淪陷時留在上海的一些電影編尋者，勝利後的作品都在「地下工作」這個圈子裏找題材，如「天字第一號」「黑夜到天明」「慾海潮」等，現在這部「粉紅色的炸彈」也沒有例外。</p>
<p>這些描寫「地下工作」的故事裏，就缺少了眞實的生活，只是劇作者槪念化了的搬弄人物，那些人物沒有血肉，沒有性格，沒有生活，自然也無思想，試問這樣的劇本如何能使觀衆感動，對它發生共鳴？</p>
<p>「粉紅色炸彈」　把那個女諜報員陸佩娟寫得如此神出鬼沒，機警英勇，而那個特派員徐公旺反而如此的大意糊塗而且荒唐，他竟把最重要的文件隨便放在他臥室裏，一點沒有警惕心，二個敵方的爪牙，毫不費力的就把他的重要機關破獲了，使得這一組諜報人員差一點被一網打盡，這簡直是諷刺。再說，敵僞方面的偵緝處長與偵緝隊長都是好色之徒，看見了女人便什麼都會忘記，這也是無法使人相信的，我想在淪陷區裏躭過的人，都不會忘記那些敵僞手下的爪牙特務走狗是怎樣一付兇殘的面目與陰險的手腕，而像偵緝隊長那樣一個敵偽的特務走狗，竟還能有天良反正，這實在太少可能了。而且劇中使他反正的唯一交待是他的愛人（歌女梁曼玲）受刑時的疼苦掙扎刺激了他，那末如果受刑的女人不是他的愛人呢？像這樣一個人物能够改變他的生活單單只爲了一個女人，實在是絕不可能的，况且對於這種走狗人物寄於莫大的同情，是一種可怕的毒素。</p>
<p>內容決定了形式，導演對戲的處理也是平庸無特色。顧蘭君的演技無發展，嚴化演得極爲過火，唯一可取的是倉隱秋的處長太太。</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>金城江的鎭市距離公路相當遠，離鐵路車站却很近，也有不少走公路的商車是停在鎭上的，爲的裝貨的便利。從那兒開出的車子是起點，不比過路車輛，照理是應該空一些的。老祝覺得那憲兵的確提醒了他。</p>
<p>他在這三四里長的一段大路上倉惶奔馳着，心裏不但很急，而且有一些亂，幾次他想撮起嘴唇來，吹一段他自己最愛吹的曲調「51115271……」，却沒有成功。</p>
<p>經過横跨金城江的那座大木橋時，他聽到有口琴的聲音，從橋底下傳上來，還夾着一個小女孩的天眞的歡笑；他知道是張昌他們在伴着緋緋玩，可是他竟提不起興緻去招呼他們，衹從急走改成緩步，略略抒了一口氣。</p>
<p>鎭外原有的三四家全部用竹子搭成的小旅館依舊分左右矗立在路的兩旁，老祝懷疑盧前所聽到的大火的消息並不眞實；可是再走了二三百步路，他眼前就展開了一幅最慘痛的火景。在鐵路和以前的鐵路賓館之間的原有的那座小鎭已經究全失蹤了，但也看不划火災後例有的那些頸垣殘壁，因爲這鎭上除掉鐵路賓館之外，根本就沒有一間瓦房，所有的全是竹和木搭成的篷子；大火一燒，所剩下的全是一堆堆的刦灰了。</p>
<p>金城江這一次所受的火的洗禮簡直比上兩次更澈底，所有的店舖和人家全燒爭了，傢伙衣物，什麼都變了灰，連好幾輛停在鐵路車站附近的卡車也燒成了骷髏似的殘骸。</p>
<p>走到這焦黑色的鎭的邊緣上，祝兆年的心已冷了一半，他頹喪地睜眼看着自己的四周；原有的路徑已完全不能辨認了，偶然還可以看到燒成枯木似的人的屍體，零亂地躺在被火燒得兩手空空的那些活人的旁邊。砲彈和槍彈爆炸的痕跡，離火車站很遠也可以看到了。</p>
<p>「這些該死的混蛋」！想到前方戰事那樣的緊張，而這裏却有大批軍火，由於那些荒唐的官佐的不負責任，竟如此地糟踢掉，還連帶毀滅了一個鎭，老祝不由目眦欲裂，大聲咀咒着。</p>
<p>「混蛋！你們還駡我」？冷不防突然有個蒼老而顫抖的聲音，打他身子的左邊傳了過來。</p>
<p>老祝詫愕地旋過頭去。</p>

<h3>Communist Army Outside Changchun Moves Southward: Fierce Fighting in Siping and Meihekou; Defense Works in Shenyang to be Completed Within a Week</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Changchun, 25th] Small bands of Communist troops continue to disrupt the outskirts of Changchun. Yesterday at midnight, over 300 Communist soldiers trespassed upon Tangyingzi, five li north of Shichengzi. They were defeated by the defending troops around 3:00 AM on the 25th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Changchun, 25th] The Communist forces originally planning to attack Changchun have bypassed its periphery and moved southward to attack important cities along the Changchun-Shenyang Railway. When Nationalist troops flew over Siping in the past few days, a large force of Communist troops was spotted moving towards the city area within twenty li west of Siping. It is widely rumored here that the Communist forces attacked Siping at dusk on the 24th, engaging in fierce battles with the Nationalist army. Military officials here have neither confirmed nor denied this, stating only that it is confirmed the main force of the Communist army has moved southward. Except for a small number of Communist troops still present in Dalingzhen, thirty li west of Changchun, and Fanjiatun, twenty li to the south, there are no Communist troops in other areas around Changchun.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Changchun, 25th] The citizens of Changchun have spent the quietest two nights in a week amid a state of emergency and have enjoyed comfortable sleep. With the continuous arrival of Nationalist transport planes at the new airport and the completion of city defense arrangements, the anxiety of the 600,000 residents threatened by the Communist army's siege has gradually eased, and order within the city has returned to normal.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Jilin, 25th] As the Communist army suffers successive defeats here, the situation within the city continues to improve. The continuous airlift of supplies by the Nationalist air force has boosted public morale, and the work of comforting the troops is being carried out enthusiastically.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Communist forces harassing the area between Yitong and Shuangyang have been somewhat weakened by the defending troops' counterattacks, but their ambition remains undiminished. They appear to be continuing their intrusion southeastward. The Nationalist army has rushed to encircle and suppress them in separate directions.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Changchun, 25th] A portion of the Communist army that captured Shuangyang, southeast of Changchun, on the afternoon of the 23rd, captured the Yantongshan Railway Station on the Shenyang-Jilin Line on the morning of the 25th. Their movements are unclear. Fierce fighting is raging in the Meihekou and Hailong areas.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Shenyang, 25th] The crisis in Siping has become more stable due to the power of the air force and the counterattacks of reinforcements. The Communist army appears to be retreating.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Changchun, 25th] A railway bridge on the China Changchun Railway, south of Siping, has been destroyed by the Communist army. The old Siping, west of Siping, has been occupied by the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Changchun, 25th] Approximately five divisions, totaling over 30,000 Communist troops, have invaded southward along the China Changchun Railway. According to military sources here, fierce fighting broke out near Siping last night, although the details of the battle are still unknown. It is only known that the Hāfú Railway Station (on the Siping Line) on the Pingmei Railway and the Guojiaodian Railway Station (north of Siping) on the China Changchun Railway have been captured by the Communist army.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Shenyang, 25th] The battles in Siping and Meihekou are particularly fierce today, the 25th, in Northeast China. In Meihekou, the Communist army is fiercely attacking Meihekou with a large force of five divisions and three brigades. The Nationalist army is thinly stretched, and the situation is precarious.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Panling, 25th] The situation in Dongfeng, Xifeng, and Xi'an along the Pingmei Railway has become more stable. However, Kangping on the China Changchun Railway has fallen again, and Faku is under renewed threat. North of Siping, the Nationalist troops in Guojiaodian and Lishu have shifted their positions.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Shenyang, 25th] Starting from the 25th, the military and police in Shenyang are mobilizing the public to build city defense works, such as digging trenches in the suburbs, which are scheduled to be completed within a week to aid in defense.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Shenyang, 25th] The Communist army in southern Liaoning is attempting to contain the Nationalist army by sending two groups of approximately 2,000 soldiers each out of Pulandian and Piziwo to harass the area. On the 25th, they reached the northeast of Wafangdian, and the Nationalist army is currently pursuing and attacking them.</p>
<h3>Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and Other Schools Decide to Resume Classes Today; Hu Shih Convenes Meeting with Student Representatives</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Peiping, 25th] Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and other schools have decided to "suspend the suspension" starting on the 26th. Hu Shih again convened a meeting with representatives from the North China Student Union and Peking University's departments last night to persuade them to resume classes on the 26th. Mr. Hu stated that student movements are a natural reaction of youth to dissatisfaction with reality and cannot be directly attributed to the instigation of the Communist Party. However, political and economic problems cannot be resolved through strikes. Furthermore, strikes should not be used to respond to repeated incidents inside and outside the school, as this will lead to endless unrest. In times of turmoil, calmness is especially needed, and rumors should not be easily believed. Mr. Hu also stated that the Peiping authorities have not interfered in this student movement, but everyone hopes that students will no longer incite strikes, especially among middle school students, as they are not yet adults and cannot be held responsible for any events. Moreover, the Communist army is very close to Peiping, and local authorities cannot ignore this.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Tianjin, 25th] The striking students of Nankai University continued to divide into more than ten teams at 6:00 PM on the 25th, going to factories and schools in Tianjin to promote the "Anti-Civil War, Anti-Famine" movement and performing plays such as "Triumph" and "Million-Dollar Banknote" on campus.</p>
<h3>Xu Bingchang Offers a Word to Students Against the Civil War</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Kaifeng, 25th] Xu Bingchang, a renowned historian in China, is currently lecturing here. In light of the student unrest in various places, he has published an article titled "A Word to Students Against the Civil War," which is heartfelt and worthy of deep consideration. The article states: "The few words I want to say today are not addressed to the very few students who believe that the government is corrupt beyond redemption and must be overthrown, but to the majority of young people who are extremely frustrated because they cannot think of a solution and are therefore in danger of being easily exploited. Recently, student movements across the country have almost all shouted the clear slogans of 'Oppose the Civil War,' 'Want Peace,' and 'Oppose Famine.' These slogans themselves are irreproachable, but since the war that has continued from last year's talks and fights to today's exclusive fighting without talks, one could say, from one perspective, that neither side was sincere from the beginning of the talks. However, from another perspective, one could also say that both sides were sincere. What they both lack are not these, but because of two other major obstacles, their negotiations are not easily successful." The article goes on to point out that the first major obstacle is mutual suspicion and distrust, and the second major obstacle is that the military men on both sides—or perhaps also many of the literati—all believe that they are very confident in their ability to win. "Since they do not trust each other and all believe that they have a way to win, it is really too difficult to hope that they will not fight." The article concludes: "One of these two major obstacles has now been almost completely eliminated. It is by no means an improper thing for the people of the whole country to rise up today to oppose civil strife and demand peace, but it must be noted that a war cannot be started by one side alone, nor can it be stopped by one side alone. As the saying goes, it takes two hands to clap, which is what this means. Now, if we want to use the power of the people to stop civil strife, we need to act simultaneously with the students and the people in the so-called 'Liberated Areas,' forcing the government on one hand and the Chinese Communist Party on the other to stop fighting at the same time, and wait quietly for a negotiated solution. Only then will there be hope of success. Otherwise, simply opposing the civil war in name is actually participating in and aiding one side of the civil war, increasing the attitude of the civil war, and one's self has already become a party to the civil war. How can one oppose others?" This point is very important, and I hope that the majority of students today will think deeply about it.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Students from the agricultural and engineering colleges of Henan University initiated a movement to resume classes. On the 24th, they were actually blocked by some students from the university headquarters. However, the students requesting resumption of classes are still resolutely striving and appealing to protect the school's reputation and their studies, and they have stated that they will not stop until they achieve the goal of resuming classes and protecting the school.</p>
<h3>Missing Students from National Central University Are Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] Regarding the previous reports of the missing students Li Leding and Zhu Peiyu from National Central University and Jiang Wentong, a student from the affiliated high school of Zhejiang University, the military law office of the Capital Garrison Headquarters sent special personnel to National Central University to investigate the truth of the case. The person in charge of the school's guidance office replied that there were no such individuals as Li Leding and Zhu Peiyu, and all students have now returned to school. Shi Xundao and Dong Xinbao from the school's student self-government association stated that when the ranks were in disarray on the 20th, a classmate (whose name is unknown) pulled Jiang Wentong away from the group, and he may now be staying with relatives and friends in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>National Economic Commission to Hold First Meeting Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] The National Economic Commission is scheduled to hold its first meeting since its establishment at 3:00 PM on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Minister of Communications Answers Oral Interpellations</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] Oral interpellations on communications were presented on the morning of the 25th by nine people, including Li Peiguo, Zhang Dinghua, Cai Zhisheng, and Duan Zhuo. The focus of their interpellations was on plane crashes, railway disruptions, the need to quickly build the Baoji-Tianshui Railway, and the difficulty of purchasing train tickets, as well as the poor order on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Zhang Dinghua also raised the necessity of quickly building the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, and at the same time, the Ministry of Communications should not use this as propaganda to say how good the work is, when in reality only one-tenth of the Duyun-Guiyang section has been built, and the construction funds are only 12 billion. Although the road maintenance fees for highways have been increased, the bridges and roadbeds continue to deteriorate. Li Peiguo expressed dissatisfaction that the Peiping-Gubeikou Railway, the most important railway in the north, has not yet been repaired. He believes that the poor transportation is the reason why the Communist army surrounded Rehe and why the war was lost, and the responsibility lies with the failure to "open" the Peiping-Gubeikou Railway. Secondly, the road police's oppression of the common people and failure to cooperate with them is particularly abhorrent. Mr. Li believes that the road is like something built by corrupt officials. Cai Zhisheng stated that the traffic on the Peiping-Hankou, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai Railways is not flexible or coordinated. Sometimes there is one train a day, and sometimes there are four trains a day, and the joint transportation between the Peiping-Hankou and Longhai Railways is not cooperative. The distance between the two railways is far, and passengers transferring from the Longhai Railway to the Peiping-Hankou Railway must walk three li, which is unreasonable. At the same time, there are too many drawbacks on the Peiping-Longhai Railway, and the cost of loading and unloading goods is too high, which is an open secret known to almost everyone. Duan Zhuo said that the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway has not yet been completed, with a budget of 20 billion. How can it be enough when prices rise every day? He also believes that attention should be paid to transportation in the Northwest, and one should not dig a well only when thirsty. Gu Gengye pointed out that not many railways have been taken over in the Northeast, but there are two or three management organizations, and the chairman of the China Changchun Railway also serves as a special commissioner of the Ministry of Communications and the director of the Ministry's Highway Administration, holding several important positions at the same time. How can things be done well? Mr. Gu solemnly stated that if this continues, the rights regained by the China Changchun Railway will be abandoned again. Li Qia and Lu Xiguang both stated that the Baoji-Tianshui Railway should be built, and Mr. Lu also said that Minister Yu can go and see it in person. Others also raised issues such as the poor order on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Subsequently, four written inquiries were submitted. Minister Yu answered them at 10:30 AM, stating that the Ministry had handled all takeover matters in accordance with the law. As for some people's belief that railway construction is biased towards the Southeast, it is actually because materials are more convenient to transport along the river, while the opposite is true in the Southwest and Northwest. The congestion on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is due to too many passengers, and there are no good solutions other than raising prices and adding trains, but prices cannot be raised at present. Illegal tickets will be corrected, and the Jiangnan Railway should be repaired ahead of schedule. Regarding the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, it is currently difficult to proceed due to the inconvenience of material transportation. The section near Hengyang on the Xiang-Gui Railway has been completed, and the rest is being rushed to build. After the takeover of the Taiwan Railway, it is managed by the Taiwan Governor's Office.</p>
<h3>Ninth Meeting of the People's Political Council: Zhu Jiahua Reports on Education</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] The ninth meeting of the People's Political Council was held at 9:30 AM on the 25th. 197 council members attended, chaired by Wu Yifang. In addition to reading the minutes of the seventh and eighth meetings, oral interpellations and answers were conducted on the transportation report. After the recess, Minister Zhu Jiahua gave a report on education. Council members submitted 43 written inquiries, which were read out one by one. Due to the lack of time, only six oral inquiries were made until 1:00 PM in the afternoon. It was decided that the general meeting would continue with oral interpellations on the morning of the 26th. The chairman then announced the adjournment.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua attended the ninth general meeting of the People's Political Council on the morning of the 25th and gave a report on education. Mr. Zhu first gave a brief account of the work of educational restoration, stating that educational restoration was carried out based on the principles set at the National Educational Post-War Restoration Conference held in Chongqing in the autumn of the 34th year of the Republic. It is now largely complete, and schools at all levels have already started classes. Most of the schools that were suspended during the War of Resistance have been restored. The takeover and adjustment of schools in the recovered areas have also come to an end. The rational distribution of schools has also been partially achieved. Mr. Zhu then explained the important issues in education at present: Regarding educational funding, Mr. Zhu stated that in the 35th year of the Republic, the expenditure on education and culture in the national budget, in addition to 60 billion for restoration expenses, accounted for 2.06 percent, totaling 47.989499 million. This year it is 4.079 percent, totaling 382.1808 million. The approximate number of provinces, counties and cities is the second largest in its total expenditure. Since the change in the financial revenue and expenditure system last year, local educational funding has become more difficult. The insufficiency of educational funding, whether at the central or local level, is indeed a fact, but considering the actual state of the country's finances, the burden is already considered small. Nevertheless, the government gives special consideration to reasonable requests for additional educational funding; although the country's finances are extremely difficult, educational funding is still increasing. We should naturally make every effort to gradually increase educational funding so that it can meet actual needs. If we want to reach the standards stipulated in the Constitution, we still need to wait for the implementation of constitutional government.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of teachers and staff, Mr. Zhu first expressed his deep respect and unease for the difficult lives of those engaged in education, and said that the treatment of educational personnel at all levels must be improved as soon as possible. The Ministry is working hard to continue to find ways to improve it. For example, the treatment of university professors is the same as that of public education personnel, although there is also a subsidy for academic research (the maximum amount was originally 50,000 yuan, which was first adjusted to 150,000 yuan in April of this year, and then adjusted to 210,000 yuan). Although the salary of professors is not subject to the restrictions of official appointment like that of public education personnel, and is determined by the school based on academic status and seniority, the maximum salary of university professors has not exceeded 600 yuan, even for those who have taught for one or two decades. It seems that the limit can be appropriately increased within the limits stipulated in the official rank salary table. Similarly, the treatment of those serving in primary and secondary schools should also be appropriately adjusted so that they can be content in poverty and jointly maintain this century-old plan for education. Regarding student public expenses, Mr. Zhu stated that the public expense system was originally a temporary expedient measure taken during the War of Resistance to take into account the economic difficulties of students who had retreated to the rear and whose family economic connections had been cut off. It should have been abolished after the victory, but the government still maintains it, considering that students' families may still have economic difficulties. The significance of giving public expenses is nothing more than to help the poor and reward those who are studious and have excellent grades. Universal public expense treatment is not proportional in any country in the world. Currently, in the budget, the number of public expense students in secondary schools and above under the Ministry's jurisdiction is 130,000, the number of public expense students in construction personnel training classes is 35,600, and the number of public expense students for helping out-of-school youth is 27,000, for a total of 192,600. The treatment of public expense students is that each person receives 2.3 dou of rice per month, which is issued according to the market price in the city where the school is located, and the non-staple food expenses are calculated based on one-seventh of the basic amount of the living allowance for public education personnel. For example, the non-staple food expenses for public expense students in the Beijing-Shanghai area have recently been adjusted from 24,000 yuan to 48,000 yuan, and will continue to be adjusted every three months in accordance with the principle of adjusting the treatment of public education personnel. According to the original budget, the expenditure on public expenses accounted for 15.7 percent of the total education budget, totaling 52.3848 million yuan. The payment of public expenses has always been made one month in advance, and there have been no problems of non-payment. The government's hard work is such that the burden of entering university today is the lightest, while the burden of entering primary and secondary schools is heavier. The government does not consider changing this public expense system, which is generally fair, until the general social and economic environment has improved.</p>
<p>Regarding teaching equipment, Mr. Zhu stated that the equipment in our country's schools and academic institutions was originally very simple, and suffered great losses during the War of Resistance. It has also been difficult to replenish after the war. After years of effort, the teaching equipment has been gradually replenished and reluctantly applied. For example, the lack of textbooks and books has been continuously discussed with the publishing industry to determine methods, which has greatly printed and supplied the original Western books. Although the provisions of the International Copyright Convention cannot be arbitrarily reprinted, there have also been several times of ordering and raising funds from abroad and distributing them to thousands of schools. Practical equipment has also been purchased as much as possible, and the number is increasing day by day. The Ministry has recently drafted opinions on enriching teaching equipment and emergency measures for funding plans, including foreign exchange, and is determined to continuously increase the equipment of various schools and academic institutions in the near future. At the same time, efforts will be made to increase and repair school buildings and other facilities. The government attaches great importance to this, and it is expected that it will be implemented item by item soon.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu continued to explain the Ministry of Education's central work at the current stage, such as the promotion of national education, the strengthening of vocational education, and the acceleration of normal education, and said that education cannot be biased or abandoned. In our country, where most people are illiterate, how to enable most people to have access to education is the most urgent problem to be solved. In higher education, there are already 193 public and private colleges and universities, including independent colleges and universities, with approximately 120,000 students. Compared with before the war, the number of schools has increased by 80 percent, and the number of students has doubled. In terms of national conditions, this is also barely enough to meet the needs. Unless the conditions are met and the equipment is real, the Ministry will not easily increase schools or change the school system for the time being. Education cannot stagnate, and it is not appropriate to be conservative and stick to old ways. We must strive to move forward with the times. All of the Ministry's reforms to the school system and important educational measures are made after consulting with experts at various educational sector meetings, meticulously studying and making plans, and then implementing them, being cautious in everything.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Zhu mentioned student unrest, saying that while the reasons are certainly different, the lack of funding, incomplete equipment, general social unrest, and the influence of external politics are all contributing factors from the school's perspective. It is all the Communist elements lurking in the schools who are attempting to disrupt the schools as a means of expanding the disruption of society, in order to achieve their goal of overthrowing the foundation of the country. Therefore, they are scheming and instigating, using every means to instigate an incident in every school as a topic to launch a trend, and they should come up with a general topic to stimulate people's hearts and create a comprehensive student unrest. The endless facts that have emerged today have proven this beyond any doubt. Mr. Zhu appealed to the people of society, saying that we must not allow people with political motives to disrupt schools, and those who conspire and instigate must leave the schools. We must never allow the lawless actions of a few to hinder the studies of the vast majority of pure youth, and to harm the educational undertaking that is related to the national lifeline and the safety of the country. The school is a sacred place for learning, and we must do everything possible to stimulate the spirit of research and improve the atmosphere of reading. In addition to actively requesting the government and consulting with various schools to solve the difficult problems of the schools as soon as possible, the Ministry plans to convene the fourth National Education Conference this year to jointly review, promote, and innovate.</p>
<h3>Shao Congen's Condition Worsens</h3>
<p>President Zhang and others visit</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Nanjing, 25th] Shao Congen, a 77-year-old council member, suddenly suffered from cerebral congestion while attending a banquet hosted by Chairman Chiang on the evening of the 24th due to hard work from attending meetings for days in a row. He was sent to the Central Hospital that night around 10:00 PM, where he was treated by the famous doctor Qi Shounan. Although his condition is no longer the most serious, he is still not out of danger. Wu Dingchang, Wang Yiwu and others visited the hospital after hearing the news. When the reporter visited this morning, Jiang Yong also happened to be visiting the sick. According to him, Shao was sitting between Madam Chiang and Jiang Yong at the banquet last night, and those sitting opposite him noticed that Shao's lips turned white. Before long, Shao gradually felt unwell and sat next to Jiang, leaning closer and closer. This lasted for about half an hour, and around 9:30 PM he finally collapsed. According to Shao's beloved daughter, Ci Yun, who was serving him at the side, "My father's blood pressure was as high as 210 degrees last night, but it has now been reduced to 160 degrees, and his pulse has also been reduced from 88 beats to 64 beats." She also said, "Although my father is old, he cares about national affairs and is never behind others. After returning from the meeting yesterday morning, many friends came to the residence to discuss national affairs, and my father also gave generous speeches and did not take a nap in the afternoon. He could have not attended the meeting in the afternoon, but because the military report was important, he still reluctantly attended. This cerebral congestion can be said to be entirely caused by hard work." Shao is 77 years old this year, a native of Qingshen, Sichuan. He participated in the Xinhai Revolution and served as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Sichuan Province and the Principal of the Gentlemen's Political and Legal School. Since the first People's Political Council, he has participated in the People's Political Council as a non-partisan and non-faction member up to now, and has also participated in the Political Consultative Conference. This time, he came from Chengdu from afar. Shao's wife is 62 years old and has two daughters and four sons. The eldest daughter married Lan Ruisheng, and the second daughter, Ci Yun, works at the Bank of Sichuan and came to the meeting with him. The eldest and second sons are studying at Sichuan University, and the third and fourth sons are studying at Yintang Middle School.</p>

According to the doctor, if there is no bleeding on the 25th, there will be no danger after the 26th. Also, those who went to the hospital to visit on the 25th included President Zhang and his wife, Lei Zhen, Kong Geng, Qian Xinzhi, and Liu Dongyan.</p>

<h3>Zuo Shunsheng's Speech in Shanghai: Now is a Good Time to Improve Agriculture; Stability in Rural Areas is Necessary for Peace</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Zuo Shunsheng, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, arrived in Shanghai by night train on the 24th to inspect the department's various units in Shanghai. Reporters visited him at his private residence in Difeng Lane. The following is a summary of his remarks:</p>
<p>I have only been in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for ten days, but I have already encountered many practical problems that have attracted my great attention. The purpose of my return to Shanghai this time is because there are several important institutions under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Shanghai, such as the Aquatic Products Company, the Fish Market, the Silk Company, the Economic Farm, the Pest and Disease Medicine and Machinery Manufacturing Experimental Factory, etc. I want to meet the main responsible persons of these institutions to see what they are doing in their business, so as to learn more about the actual situation. If there are problems to be solved, I also want to find some appropriate solutions.</p>
<p>My feelings over these ten days, although I feel very anxious about the decline of the countryside today, the low purchasing power of farmers, and the seriousness of the current food problem, from the perspective of Chinese agriculture itself, there are still many optimistic points:</p>
<p>(1) China is, after all, a fundamentally agricultural country, and the nature of farmers is particularly excellent. There is no doubt that they are uniquely blessed.</p>
<p>(2) Generally speaking, friends engaged in agricultural improvement have an exceptionally strong research spirit. If the government can give them more opportunities, they will definitely be able to achieve good results.</p>
<p>(3) International friends who are enthusiastic about improving Chinese agriculture, especially in the United States, I feel that their sincere spirit is really admirable. In the past ten days, I have met several American experts in agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and improved agricultural implements. The impression they gave me was very good. I believe that they are all outstanding people with the lofty goal of promoting Sino-US agricultural technology cooperation, and they will definitely make great contributions to China's agriculture in the future.</p>
<p>I believe that China is currently at the best time to improve Chinese agriculture. As long as I am in office, I will never let go of such an opportunity easily. However, a key condition is the peace and reunification of China. China must achieve stability in rural areas in order to have true peace, and only with stability in rural areas can there be a true foundation for peace. In the Han Dynasty, there was a virtuous official who was able to get some of the people who were prone to rebellion to "sell their swords and buy oxen, sell their knives and buy calves." I would like to take these two sentences as a blessing for China's future!</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the People's Political Council</h3>
<p>— Our Reporters Yu Zhenji, Zhang Ming</p>
<p>Today is a regular Sunday holiday, but the conference continues. Especially today there is a timely education report, so the number of attendees is no less than the meetings on political, financial, and economic reports.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education undoubtedly worried about a huge storm regarding this policy address and questioning. Therefore, it first made a lot of activities before the report, greeting all parties. Minister Zhu and Vice Minister Hang were running around at the meeting place.</p>
<p>Minister of Communications Yu Dawei's answers to the questions were very soft. Those listening in the back only knew that he was indeed answering each question, even the written ones.</p>
<p>This morning, the weather in the capital was neither sunny nor rainy, a bit depressing. There were no big guns fired at the meeting place, and it was not too lively, only the buzzing sound from the audience.</p>
<p>At the end of the meeting, the chairman proposed that due to the urgency of time, there were still fifteen councilors' oral inquiries. Could they be changed to written inquiries for Minister Zhu to answer, so as to speed up the meeting? However, Huang Yuren fired a shot, saying, "Educational issues are of concern to everyone and cannot be perfunctorily dealt with like this. We must ask Minister Zhu to answer calmly at the next meeting." Then Pan Qiying responded, so everyone agreed to pass it. Finally, this shot was fired.</p>
<p>Wu Wangji hurriedly wrote a family letter in the meeting place during the break.</p>
<p>Most of the oral questions about transportation were about the Northeast Railway, and most of the written ones were about the Guangdong-Hankou Railway.</p>
<p>Whether written or oral, most of the education questions had a tone of teaching or scolding. For example, Yang Buping's written question started with "Please show your conscience, can you say that you have done a good job in education?" Next, he asked several times about the professorial student movement and so on, "Do you know? Do you know?" Some people felt that Minister Zhu couldn't take it anymore.</p>
<p>Luo Heng held on to the spirit of fighting to the end in the case of He Dekui. In the education inquiry, she mentioned again that He Dekui was a traitor who promoted enslaved education. Why are his elementary school textbooks still in use? Why not handle it?</p>
<p>Zhang Dinghua said that the Guiyang airport was cancelled, and it was not easy to buy bus tickets, which really made it so that we can neither fly nor walk out. Isn't this a traffic blockade?</p>
<p>Duan Zhuo told a story to describe the slow pace of the train. He said: "There was a ticket inspector who checked an old man who was holding a half-price ticket. He asked, why is your ticket half-price? The old man said, I was still a child when I got on the train." The whole place roared with laughter.</p>
<p>(The following are random notes from the general assembly on the 24th)</p>
<p>According to Zuo's statistics, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, which has been in existence for less than seven years, has changed six ministers. The first one, Chen Jitang, served for more than a year. The second one, Shen Honglie, served for more than two years. The third one, Sheng Shicai, served for less than a year. The fourth one served for less than a month. The fifth one, Zhou Yichun, served for more than a year. The sixth one, Zuo himself, has been in office for exactly nine days today.</p>
<p>Someone told Zuo Shunsheng that none of the 4 million pit props for the Kailuan Coal Mine are Chinese goods. Zuo said that if I advocate empty talk, I can say, "How important is afforestation!" Another thing is that the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute has only 1 billion yuan a year. Zuo believes that if it is funded with the budget of a military division,</p>
<p>Wang Zhongsheng questioned Shi Zun, first pointing out that Minister Zuo was a councilor who became an official, and he still has the same demeanor as he did back then. Zuo said as soon as he took the stage, "I have been a councilor for nine years and I know the psychology of the councilors. No one listens to his report." It is true that he wants to write a book about it.</p>
<p>Minister Zuo was very afraid that people would say that he was using private individuals from the Youth Party, so he repeatedly said that he paid attention to talents, regardless of factions, whether they are from the Youth Party or non-party members, and that he would decide based on their talents, which won him a lot of applause.</p>
<p>Many councilors mentioned the issue of surplus military officers, asking what the authorities would do with these national heroes who had made great achievements in hundreds of battles. After eight years of the War of Resistance, they had become "road generals" and were wandering the streets.</p>
<p>Chen Gengya, a journalist, appealed for his colleagues who died during the War of Resistance. He asked why the government only gave 30,000 yuan in compensation to the Jin Huating and Zhu Xingong of Shenbao, Zhang Xiaotong, and Zhang Sixu. What is that enough for?</p>
<p>Yu Dawei's report on transportation took a total of 27 minutes, the shortest of all the reports, but the place names mentioned included north, south, east, west, sea, land, and air. It was truly the shortest time and the largest space.</p>
<p>Minister Yu said that the printing cost of a stamp is 35 yuan, and adding the shipping cost, it costs 55 yuan. With some other costs added, a 100-yuan stamp can only be considered a break-even point, and a 50-yuan stamp is still losing money.</p>

<h3>Communist Defectors in Central Shandong Emerge One After Another; National Army Completes Encirclement; Communist Forces Northeast of Hongze Lake Cleared</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 25th] After the main force of the Communist forces in Central Shandong was encircled and annihilated by the National Army, the strength of the Communist forces suffered a loss of a quarter, which led to demoralization. In recent days, they have fled and scattered, and the number of those who surrendered to the National Army has also increased day by day. The National Army has seized this rare opportunity and is gradually completing the encirclement of the remnants of the Communist forces in the triangle area of Boshan, Laiwu, and Yishui. The time for the complete annihilation of the remaining main force of the Communist forces is imminent.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] According to the lowest estimate, the Communist forces have suffered more than 40,000 casualties in this decisive battle in Central Shandong, among which the 2nd, 3rd, and 8th columns suffered heavier losses.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 25th] On the 24th, the National Army's clearing corps in Western Shandong surrounded more than 1,000 Communist forces from the Yellow River Detachment in Hujiaying, southwest of Yuncheng, annihilating more than 300, capturing more than 20, and seizing 8 light machine guns and more than 40 rifles.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 25th] Yesterday, the troops of the Huaihai Pacification District cleared the area along the coast of Hongze Lake, and encountered 3,000 Communist troops from the 81st and 77th Regiments in Zhao Village and Gaojia Ferry. After a fierce battle for six hours, the Communist troops were almost completely wiped out. From then on, the Communist forces northeast of Hongze Lake can be said to have been largely cleared.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 25th] The Communist forces advancing south from Anyang have not yet launched a full-scale battle with the National Army advancing north. Both sides seem to be seeking a favorable situation. On the evening of the 24th, there was still a battle for Guangsha Paper Mill and its surrounding areas outside Anyang. The Communist forces were defeated again. The city is receiving a steady supply of food, and order is becoming more stable.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 25th] The Communist forces under Wei Fenglou in Linquan have moved to the surrounding villages, coercing the people to search for food and weapons, and are in contact with the remnants of Liu Bocheng's forces lurking in Yuan Shuizhai. A part of them has fled to Erlangong Village and Miao Village in Fuyang, and they are eagerly awaiting reinforcements to attack.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 4th] The Communist forces besieging Xiangning have increased to more than 20,000. On the 23rd, the National Army concentrated its forces in the south of the county seat and the high ground in the Wenquan area south of the city to resist firmly. The fierce battle lasted all night. On the 24th, the battle became even more intense. More than 2,000 Communist forces advancing from Hejin to Jixian had reached the area 20 li south of the city on the 23rd and continued to attack.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 25th] On the 22nd, the National Army in Xiangning voluntarily withdrew from the Jijiayuan north of the city and the large blockhouse on the north mountain to the Wenquan Shihe area. This area is the Nanshan of Xiangning, which is necessary for defending the county seat.</p>
<h3>The United States is Watching the Situation in the Far East; Economic Aid to China Can Be Realized; The Position on the Peace Treaty with Japan Will Be Further Clarified</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] According to authoritative sources today, the current situation in the Far East has received greater attention from senior officials than it did several months ago. Secretary of State Marshall and his senior advisors have noted three events in Asia in the past week: the Japanese peace treaty, economic aid to the Central Government of China, and US-Soviet talks on the unification of Korea. Attention is now refocused on the China loan issue. Marshall said that since his return from Moscow, he has given much thought to the matter and is now studying ways to win the approval of Congress and the public for economic assistance to the Chinese government. Chinese officials here believe there is a good chance that part of the $500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank can be used before the end of June, and that the deadline can be extended. Marshall's statement also indicates that he is considering an approach that places more emphasis on direct foreign aid authorized by Congress, as is currently being given to Greece and Turkey. He believes that President Chiang has made some progress in moving the Chinese government toward liberalization, and that future developments may warrant economic assistance from the United States to the Chinese government. Some officials here believe that if the Chinese government authorities can submit a satisfactory plan for the use of the funds, there is still an opportunity to obtain some funds from the Export-Import Bank. Some observers are convinced that if the political situation in China improves, the United States may allocate part of the loan and implement a large-scale economic assistance program managed by the United States in China after reviewing its plans.</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese peace treaty, well-informed sources hope that the United States will clarify its position on the Japanese peace treaty in the coming weeks and begin to explore procedural opinions from various countries. Political and economic experts have been studying for months the type of peace that the United States needs to conclude with Japan and will soon be completed. Although the United States has not yet determined the date and location of the peace conference, it is generally believed that the United States will suggest holding a Japanese peace treaty conference in Washington or San Francisco this fall. Some people in the military advocate holding it in Tokyo. As for which countries should participate in the drafting of the treaty, some Americans strongly advocate that the eleven-nation Far East Commission handle it, but some officials believe that the organization is too large to complete the work in a reasonable period of time, so they advocate that a smaller group draft the treaty. The United States will strongly oppose any proposal to have any one of the four or five major powers draft the treaty, as the United States believes that countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines have done more and longer in the war against Japan than some of the five major powers.</p>
<h3>Three Communist Party Members in the Philippines Arrested by the Police for Violating the Law</h3>
<p>Two Employees of Xinhua Bookstore Still in Custody</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 24th] Last night, several Chinese Communist Party members in the Chinese district of Manila had their first fight with two inspectors from the Immigration Bureau. Today, the Philippine police arrested three Communist Party members for violating the law, but their names have not yet been announced. The two Immigration Bureau inspectors were attacked by several overseas Chinese while searching for a rogue foreigner (rumored to be a Communist Party member). It is believed that these overseas Chinese are comrades of the searched person. Both inspectors were injured. Immigration Bureau Director Fabri said in a statement this afternoon that there was no legitimate reason for the overseas Chinese to riot and that the Immigration Bureau would do its best to ensure that they receive the punishment they deserve. It is also learned that two employees of the Communist-run Xinhua Bookstore were arrested several weeks ago and are still in custody.</p>

<h3>Price Controls Implemented in Taiyuan; Announcement Stipulates That Soldiers Eat First-Class Food; Citizens With More Than Six Months of Grain Reserves Will Not Be Issued Purchase Certificates</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 25th] Commodity prices in Taiyuan are fluctuating greatly, especially the prices of grain and flour, which are twice as high as those in Shanghai. Director Yan decided that effective today, he would implement the economic control measures decided by representatives of merchants and citizens, and convened representatives of grain, flour, cloth, coal, salt, and oil merchants, as well as relevant people's representatives, to study reasonable and effective ways to stabilize prices. On the evening of the 24th, the Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government specially convened senior personnel from subordinate and economic departments, as well as those responsible for the grain merchants' joint association and the rice yarn industry association, to discuss the matter. Yan proposed that all banks, shops, and money shops should be quickly ordered to tighten loans immediately and lend them to grain and flour merchants to purchase and store grain and flour. Merchants who go to other counties to purchase grain should be assisted by the administration and protected by the army. All were resolved. On the 25th, an announcement was made on the method of controlling food grains, implementing simplified living. Soldiers eat first-class food, those who participate in self-defense and public servants eat second-class food, and the rest eat third-class food. First-class food is half rice and half wheat, second-class food is rice and wheat for two days, fine grains for eight days, and coarse grains for twenty days. Third-class food is wheat flour for one day a month, fine grains for four days, and coarse grains for twenty-five days. Second and third class food have one extra day of coarse grains in June. The purchase procedures and quotas will be announced separately. Citizens report their own grain reserves. Those who exceed six months will not be issued purchase certificates for the time being. Merchants store grain and sell it to grain merchants at the original price. If they conceal it and are found out, both the buyer and the seller will be punished by half of the transaction price. Grain transported from other counties to the province will not be punished. The purchase of raw materials for production will be regulated separately. There are also preliminary plans to restrict luxury consumption, control restaurants and theaters, provide relief to unemployed people, and alleviate the living difficulties of public servants and students. On the 25th, commodity prices in Taiyuan fell, and rice and wheat fell by 100,000 yuan per shi.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Investigates the Total Number of Poor Households; Decides to Start Selling at Reduced Prices on June 1; Hangzhou Rice Stores Limit Sales to Two Dou Per Customer</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 25th] The city's rice market has resumed normal operations, and rice merchants are selling at the limited prices, which is a good situation. Today, the Zhenjiang County Government was ordered to form a Pingluo Committee together with the security authorities, the Chamber of Commerce, and local gentry to supervise the township leaders to investigate the total number of poor households within three days and decide to start selling at reduced prices on June 1. It is reported that there are about 6,000 shi of stored grain in Zhenjiang County, which is far from enough for selling at reduced prices.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>We have read in your newspaper of May 10 an item concerning the Anqing County Bank's forced purchase of surplus military grain, which is inconsistent with the facts. The grain purchased by our bank was the county's share of grain from land taxes collected by the County Land Grain Office. In December of last year, the county government, in conjunction with the County Council, submitted a request to Director Pu of the Finance Department for approval to sell it due to the need for funds at the end of the year. The county's share of land grain was 2,500 shi, priced at 25,000 yuan per shi. Subsequently, the county government convened a meeting of local officials and gentry to decide to sell it to our bank at an increased price of 28,000 yuan. After the transaction, it was still stored in the warehouses of the various townships and baoli. Later, due to the urgent need to sell it off, our bank's board of directors invited local officials and gentry to hold a joint meeting in April of this year, as well as a joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors, and the purchasers negotiated and determined the purchase price separately according to the current rice price in the port at that time. After the negotiation was completed, the local rice price suddenly soared. A small number of local elements took advantage of the public's anxiety and incited the public, saying that the rice stored in our bank was reserved by the government for the spring famine and should be sold at a low price. The masses did not understand the truth, which led to the May 9th riot. The case is now being thoroughly investigated by various higher-level agencies, and the truth will soon be revealed. The details reported by your newspaper are presumed to be based on inaccurate rumors. We are now sending this letter of correction, hoping that you will publish it to clarify the matter. Sincerely, Huaining County Bank.</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday, our newspaper carried a telegram from Wuxi regarding a prisoner escape. This was a mistake; the telegram was from Jiangyin. We hereby correct it.</p>

<p>In recent years, financial administration has continued to follow a consistent policy, namely, to utilize financial power to support production, establish a financial system, strengthen financial operations, and regulate the financial market. Although various measures have not fully achieved the expected results due to environmental limitations, the following are important measures that can be specifically reported on in the past year:</p>
<p>(1) Launching Production Enterprise Loans: After the victory, in view of the urgent need for rehabilitation and construction, we immediately urged the Four Joint Offices to provide substantial loans to various production enterprises. Regarding agricultural loans, last year was divided into two types: emergency agricultural loans and ordinary agricultural loans. The original plan was to lend a total of 30 billion yuan, but it was increased several times to meet actual needs. In the past year, it has been reported that emergency agricultural loans have been approved for a total of 6,000 , and we are constantly considering the actual situation and ordering the state to communicate, salt, grain, trade and other loans, as well as more than 5.1 million US dollars. From January to April of the 36th year, industrial loans approved amounted to more than 10,000 billion. In addition, more than 200 commercial bank funds in Northeast circulation notes are suitable for production purposes. The Central Bank previously led Shanghai banking firms and formed an industrial and commercial loan syndicate to handle loans for small and medium-sized factories and export trade, and the Central Bank undertook rediscounting, re-mortgaging, and re-pledging. Recently, the bank has established a Discount Committee to formulate discount rules and handle discounts for commercial banks and firms. This measure will be first implemented in Shanghai and then推广全国. This measure will enable general funds to be invested in production enterprises and help the recovery of the national economy. Subsequently, in order to coordinate and assist production enterprises, we consulted with the Four Joint Offices to formulate the "General Rules for Handling Production Enterprise Loans in Various Places", which was implemented nationwide. It was designated to be carried out in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Qingdao, Wuhan, Changsha, Nanchang, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guangzhou and other regions, led by local national banks and local banks and commercial firms to promote and handle. It will be particularly helpful in improving the current economic situation. The government has recently, in order to relieve the pressure of high interest rates on agricultural and industrial production as much as possible, stipulated in the Emergency Economic Plan to strengthen financial regulatory measures, and clearly stipulated the targets of loans for various types of banks.</p>
<p>(2) Establishing a Financial System: After the victory, the Ministry of Finance, based on the actual financial situation and referring to the banking systems of various countries, drafted a complete set of banking laws and regulations, including the Central Bank Law, the Regulations for the Three State-Owned Banks and Two Bureaus, the Banking Law, the Savings Bank Law, and the Provincial Bank Regulations. Drafts of nine laws and regulations were sent to the Legislative Yuan for review, and they will soon be formulated and promulgated. In addition, improvements have also been made to trust and insurance businesses. In the future, various types of financial institutions will have a more complete system and will be coordinated and utilized to achieve the task of using financial power to support production and construction.</p>
<p>(3) Managing Banking Operations, with equal emphasis on pre-event guidance and post-event correction. Regarding the use of bank funds, in recent years, we have continued to follow a consistent policy and, in accordance with the suggestions made by your council in the past, guided them to invest in production and construction enterprises in order to increase production of materials and stabilize prices. The credit business of national banks, in addition to being supervised by the Four Joint Offices at any time in accordance with regulations, is also required to prepare tables and reports on a regular basis for review. In the case of provincial and county banks, the Central Bank and the financial departments of each province supervise and inspect them separately, and the ministry reviews and processes them. As for the actual operating conditions of commercial bank funds, the head office in Beijing and Shanghai directly dispatched personnel to inspect their business. After returning to the capital last year, the ministry conducted a general survey in the two places, and more than 200 firms were inspected. The Central Bank was authorized to inspect the other firms separately. The ministry rigorously reviewed the inspection reports, and those with abnormal business operations and those whose use of funds exceeded the correct track were corrected and dealt with separately, without any leniency. In order to understand the financial situation in various places after the rehabilitation and to review the performance of the Central Bank and the provincial financial departments in inspecting and supervising various banks, the ministry implemented a system of circuit auditing and dispatched personnel to Guangzhou and Hankou to investigate and supervise. After the Emergency Economic Plan was announced, the ministry strengthened the inspection of banks in order to cooperate and rectify them. Restrictions have also been placed on the resumption of business by banks and money shops and the establishment of branches. Recently, seventeen areas, including Beijing, Shanghai, and Hankou, have been designated to restrict the resumption of business by firms and the establishment of branches, strengthening control. It is believed that financial business will gradually be brought back into order thereafter. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Stability First</h3>
<p>—A Message for the Opening of the Third Session of the Shanghai Municipal Council—</p>
<p>The Third Session of the Shanghai Municipal Council opens this morning. Before the opening, we know that the Municipal Council held seven days of municipal policy symposiums in various districts, and Speaker Pan also visited various districts for nine consecutive days to find out where the real public opinion lies. In today's turbulent society, we cannot help but pay special attention to the convening of this Municipal Council, and with full enthusiasm, we hope that this council will fulfill its responsibilities, speak more on behalf of the citizens, and first make good decisions on the stability that the city's citizens seek day and night, and then move on to plan municipal construction and the revival of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest city in our country, ranking first among all provinces and cities in the country in terms of industry and commerce and culture and education. It is also the focus of attention at home and abroad. Any administrative measure is enough to affect the whole country. The municipal authorities will never neglect the importance of their position. The Municipal Council, which represents the will of the people, has the responsibility to convey the people's sentiments and lay the foundation for civil governance. In this high-pitched tide of democracy, the direction of public opinion in China's first city is something we will see in the achievements of this Municipal Council.</p>
<p>In the past half month, student movements have been turbulent, rising and falling, leading a few who have ulterior motives to use pure young people to further incite strikes and market boycotts to expand social unrest. People's minds are restless, and there is almost no possibility of living and working in peace and contentment. Therefore, today's political measures, whether for the national economy or the people's livelihood, and whether for the central government or the local government, everything must put stability first. Before and after the convening of the National Political Council, voices of peace came from all directions. The Political Council is also discussing various proposed peace plans, hoping to achieve stability through peace. In fact, in our opinion, stability must come first before peace can be achieved. What the citizens of Shanghai now yearn for most urgently is social stability, and the maintenance of order is the responsibility that citizens and the government should share. It should be known that only in a stable situation can the progress of Shanghai's municipal administration be expected to improve with each passing day. At the same time, it is believed that only in a stable environment can the citizens live and work in peace and contentment and restore the vitality that was wounded during the War of Resistance. The Shanghai Municipal Councilors are all directly elected by the citizens through voting. They not only come from the people but should also be the people who can most intimately understand the hardships of the people's livelihood. Their meeting should not be similar to the idle class's empty talk, nor can they simply blame the government and negatively criticize it as doing their best. We expect that the Municipal Council will be able to represent the citizens in expressing the pain in the hearts of the people to all parties in the government and the public, and in accordance with the wishes of the citizens, open up a way out for today's turbulent situation in Shanghai, lead this Shanghai, which is startled several times a night, onto the path of peace and stability, and then achieve the purpose of recovery and prosperity, and set a good example for all provinces and cities in the country.</p>
<p>It is heard that as of yesterday, the Municipal Council has received more than ninety proposals submitted by the councilors. The councilors' enthusiasm for making proposals for municipal administration and serving the citizens can be seen. However, if we are to make proposals at this time and in this place, there should be a distinction between priorities. As mentioned above, the people's hearts throughout the country today are all yearning for the realization of domestic peace and stability. The citizens of Shanghai are particularly eager for social stability. The councilors' proposals should determine a key point. Rather than talking loftily and putting forward many unrealistic problems, wasting precious time on meaningless debates, it is better to target reality, seek solutions, and point out the direction for the citizens of Shanghai and the government to work together. In the call for peace throughout the country, it is possible to effectively restore stability in Shanghai first, so that everyone can live and work in peace and contentment. Its significance is different from the ordinary, and its task is even more extraordinary. Here, we cannot but call again, "Stability First!"</p>
<p>The distress of the overall situation and the dangers of the environment, although they make every citizen feel troubled, the citizens' demands and wishes are indeed very simple, as long as they can live and work in peace and contentment. But how can we do it so that the people are not disappointed? In fact, there is no magic. It is only necessary for the government to like what the people like and hate what the people hate! What is most feared is that the government authorities are muddle-headed and perfunctory, without any sense of right and wrong, not distinguishing between black and white, only caring about the present and not planning for the future. The result of perfunctory compromise will inevitably lead to collapse and disintegration. Just take the citizens' desire for living in peace as an example. In the current environment, wars and flames of war are spreading throughout the country, and student movements and rice movements are rampant everywhere. Coupled with the soaring prices and the heavy burden of life, the conspiracy of the ambitious squeezes the people so much that they cannot even breathe. How can the citizens live in peace? Therefore, to enable the people to live in peace, the first step is to stabilize society. The National Government has promulgated "Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order" in the past, and the Mayor of Shanghai has also promulgated four implementation measures for maintaining law and order. Various public organizations in Shanghai have also sent telegrams to support them, advocating that they be implemented effectively. However, social stability relies entirely on the government to maintain it. In the end, it feels like it is reliable but not reliable. This time, the Municipal Council must represent the people to stand up and speak out for social stability. On the one hand, it will express the people's inner distress, and on the other hand, it will clearly declare the people's desire for stability, curb the conspiracies of all ambitious people, and at the same time, make the government not give them any gaps to take advantage of. If the councilors can take this opportunity to represent the will of the people and discuss a concrete method to stabilize society, so that the people can live in peace, it will be more valuable than passing dozens or hundreds of proposals.</p>
<p>As for working in peace and contentment, this is easier to achieve after society is stable. However, we must tell the councilors and the municipal authorities that today's Shanghai, although outwardly draped in a garment of prosperity, in reality, it has cast a dark shadow of economic depression and the people's misery. Especially in the remote suburbs or slums, it is simply possible to see that Shanghai actually contains two worlds. One is a "den of consumption" that is outwardly prosperous but actually excessively extravagant; the other is a dark hell where people do not have enough to eat, not enough to wear, no roof over their heads, not an inch of land under their feet, not knowing what will happen in the morning, and lives are like ants! Let's not talk about how to truly prosper Shanghai's industry and commerce, but at least in a passive aspect, the government should do its utmost to avoid all measures that may hinder or destroy the development of industry and commerce, so that every citizen can work in peace and contentment and freely develop their careers. Among the councilors, many are representatives of the industrial and commercial sectors. Whether for their own interests or for the interests of the industrial and commercial sectors they represent, they should speak as much as possible in the Municipal Council, list the various obstacles and constraints that industry and commerce are currently encountering, and demand that the municipal authorities remove them one by one.</p>
<p>In short, the issues discussed by this Municipal Council should focus on stabilizing society and relieving the hardships of the people's livelihood. Other non-urgent matters can be left to be discussed at length in the future. If this Municipal Council can make good decisions on stabilizing society, it will not only be the happiness of the citizens of Shanghai, but also its influence can be spread throughout the country. We sincerely pray that this Municipal Council can achieve something in this regard.</p>

<h3>US Emphasizes Middle East Oil Region, Determined to Prevent Soviet Influence From Penetrating, Connolly's Visit to Iran and Turkey Is of Great Importance</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Our Washington correspondent, Lun Jin, reports: The visit of Admiral Connolly, Commander of the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet, to Iran and Turkey indicates that President Truman's anti-communist doctrine is backed by military power. This trip by Connolly will obtain valuable information for the development of a new U.S. global strategic policy to protect the interests of the Middle East, which are of utmost importance to the United States. Official sources expect that military design experts will formulate a new U.S. military strategy based on the information obtained by Connolly, with Greece, Turkey, and the Middle East oil region regarded as the lifeline of the United States. This does not mean that Britain has withdrawn from these regions or that the United States has taken over the responsibility for the region. British and American officials in Washington continue to deny this statement, but the aforementioned U.S. policy does have the following implications: (1) The United States has accepted the gradually developing responsibility in Greece and Turkey, equivalent to a military alliance in European terms, and will never abandon this responsibility during the period when the Soviet Union is pursuing what is considered an expansionist policy in the region. (2) The United States will never allow the Middle East oil region to fall within the Soviet sphere of influence, as the U.S. fleet relies on the supply of Middle East oil in any wartime operations. (3) The U.S. State Department and the Army Department recognize the Dardanelles Strait as the key to any threat that the United States would not hesitate to resist with force. According to officials familiar with the strategy of the British and American command, the United States does not replace Britain's responsibility in the Middle East, as the United States itself also has significant responsibility in the area. Although the goals of the two countries sometimes coincide, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from engaging in expansionist threats in this most sensitive and troubled region in the world, the two major powers of Britain and the United States must maintain military cooperation to be prepared.</p>
<h3>First Batch of US Military Delegation Arrives in Athens, Draft Agreement Between US and Turkey Can Be Established Soon</h3>

<p>[Reuters, Ankara, 24th] After a long discussion between Turkish Foreign Minister Sayga and U.S. Ambassador Wilson, a draft agreement on the method of U.S. aid to Turkey will be established within days. After signing, the Turkish government will submit a bill on this matter to the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] It was announced here today that eight U.S. minesweepers that participated in the Royal Navy during the invasion of the west coast of the European continent have been sold to Turkey and will be sailed to Turkey by Turkish Navy Colonel Osott.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 24th] It is reported that two British military trucks were attacked by guerrillas in western Thrace. People here were shocked to hear the news. It is the first time since 1945 that British troops have been attacked by guerrillas.</p>
<h3>Czech-Hungarian Exchange of Residents, Negotiations Successfully Completed</h3>

<h3>Palestine Investigation Committee Holds First Meeting</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 24th] The United Nations Special General Assembly's Fact-Finding Committee on Palestine is scheduled to hold its first meeting on the 26th. It will be opened by Lai, Secretary-General of the United Nations Agency. The agenda has three items: (1) election of the chairman; (2) discussion of the work plan; and (3) the route of the committee's trip to the Middle East in mid-June. Regarding this point, it will involve the question of whether the committee should visit refugee camps. Arab countries in the United Nations Special General Assembly expressed the hope that a distinction should be made between the Palestine issue and the refugee issue, while Zionism believes that the issue is closely related.</p>
<h3>Illegal Jewish Refugees Being Deported to Cyprus</h3>
<p>[United Press, Jerusalem, 24th] 1,459 refugees from an illegal Jewish immigrant ship were transferred by British troops to a British deportation ship today and sailed from Haifa Port at dawn today to a detention camp on the island of Cyprus.

<h3>Smuts' Remarks</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Cape Town, 24th] South African Prime Minister Smuts received a representative from the American "Time Magazine" on his 77th birthday today and gave a speech, believing that although relations between the powers are tense today, they will not lead to war. He expressed distrust of the "One World" theory created by Wallace of the United States. He believes that the world should be maintained by the strong power of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, because if only the United States and the Soviet Union are in frequent contact, then these two "nouveau riche" powers will inevitably have conflicts from time to time. He also believes that the end of World War II has left the world in an unstable peace. The withdrawal of European forces from Asia has further increased the instability of Asia. India seems to have reached the edge of long-term turmoil, and defeated Japan has been completely suppressed. But Asia is now in the hands of Asians, who are taking responsibility themselves.</p>
<h3>British-French Conference Resolves to Improve West African Transportation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Dakar, French West Africa, 24th] The British-French Transportation Conference closed here today.

<h3>British-Polish Negotiations to Begin, Revising the Treaty of Mutual Assistance Through Diplomatic Channels</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 25th] The "Sunday Times" stated that Britain and Poland will soon begin negotiations to revise the Treaty of Mutual Assistance between the two countries, signed on August 25, 1939, to suit the current situation. The original treaty stipulated that if one of the signatory countries was attacked by a European country, the other signatory country would provide assistance. The original treaty was valid for five years, and if one party did not explicitly abolish it within six months after five years, it would continue to be in effect. Recently, when British Foreign Secretary Bevan met with Polish Foreign Minister Sheeran at Warsaw, he suggested that negotiations on amendments be started through normal diplomatic channels to suit the current environment. However, it is still doubtful whether this negotiation can be held before the completion of the amendment negotiation of the British-Soviet alliance treaty.</p>
<h3>Indo-Dutch Negotiations: Dutch Side Denies Breakdown</h3>

The Dutch delegation's return to the Netherlands is to report to the Dutch government on the suggestions and proposed amendments made by the Indonesian side to the Dutch proposals. They will return to the Dutch East Indies in three weeks, at which time the effectiveness of the Linggadjati Agreement will certainly become apparent." Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir also stated, "I am not pessimistic about the situation. We are now planning to handle the implementation of the entire Linggadjati Agreement. I fully believe that the situation will become clear after the Dutch cabinet receives the report from Prime Minister Beel's inspection of the Dutch East Indies and makes a decision." Beel and Dutch Overseas Colonial Minister Jonkman have already returned to the Netherlands from Indonesia.</p>

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Begins Cabinet Formation; Determined to Implement Established Policy; Visits Three Party Leaders to Request Cooperation</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party held a meeting this afternoon, where Prime Minister Katayama explained his cabinet formation policy, emphasizing that the established policy of the party is to use every possible means to form a national unity government.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] Prime Minister Katayama met with a group of reporters for the first time at 7:15 PM on the 24th and immediately issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows: (1) Establish a democratic parliament; (2) Abandon bureaucratic feudal politics and build a peaceful and prosperous country; (3) Stabilize the lives of the people; (4) Implement spiritual revolution to establish a tranquil and harmonious government; (5) Cabinet formation will be based on the established policy of the four-party coalition cabinet and move forward vigorously. Katayama also broadcast to the entire nation at 9:00 PM on the same day, saying, "I was unanimously elected as Prime Minister by both houses of the Diet on the 23rd, and today the investiture ceremony has been held. This is due to the support and trust of the people. General MacArthur also gave me encouragement full of goodwill today, which is definitely not just for me alone, but is an encouragement to the Japanese nation and the entire people. Currently, our country is still facing an economic and national crisis that cannot be ignored. I bear the heavy responsibility of forming a cabinet, and I feel even more deeply that the responsibility of the largest party is great. I will make sincere efforts to overcome the crisis, and I hope that everyone will understand my enthusiasm and give me support."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Social Democratic Party is working feverishly to form a coalition cabinet as soon as possible. Katayama Tetsu visited the leaders of various parties today, and met with Uehara Etsujiro, representing former Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru, and Ashida Hitoshi, leader of the Democratic Party. Uehara and Ashida agreed to clarify the positions of the two parties tomorrow. Katayama Tetsu also visited Miki Takeo, secretary-general of the National Cooperative Party, who assured that the National Cooperative Party would fully support the Social Democratic Party.</p>
<h3>Awaiting Yoshida to Express His Attitude</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] Political observers here unanimously believe that since Katayama has obtained MacArthur's support and the investiture ceremony has been held, Katayama's cabinet will not fail. However, Yoshida's avoidance of meeting seems to indicate that he has not changed his determination to retreat to the opposition party. Although the Socialist Party is working hard to organize a four-party coalition cabinet, it is only a matter of personnel and will eventually fail. The previously planned 5-5-5-1 cabinet ratio may be changed to a 6-6-1 ratio, and the remaining three cabinet members will be selected from non-partisan members of the House of Representatives. In this way, not only can the problem of the Socialist Party's left wing joining the cabinet be solved, but also the internal factional problems of the Democratic Party can be expected to be eliminated. In short, everything still depends on Yoshida's formal expression of his final attitude after returning to Tokyo on the 26th before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3>British Empire to Discuss Two Policies Towards Japan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] Informed sources here recently stated that the United Kingdom and its dominions may hold a meeting in Canberra, the capital of Australia, before the end of August to discuss a common policy on the peace treaty with Japan. The Australian government has requested Prime Minister Attlee to convene this meeting, but the Prime Minister will not announce his decision for the next few days.</p>
<h3>Mexico Considering Resuming Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Mexico City, 24th] Official economists claimed today that although Mexico has announced that it is studying the resumption of trade with Japan, it will take a long time to reach pre-war figures, and at that time, trade with Japan was less than 2% of Mexico's total imports and exports. After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a notification from the United Kingdom last week that it could resume direct communication with Japanese commercial firms, it had considered reopening the possibility of commercial relations between Mexico and Japan, but this kind of communication was limited to inquiring about and answering market conditions, and could not conclude transactions. In the ten years before the war, Mexico's exports to Japan were almost entirely cotton, zinc, and refined lead ingots. The figures varied greatly, at US$1.46 million in 1934, US$36.8 million in 1936, US$7 million in 1938, and dropping to US$1.86 million in 1939. Exports were mainly silk, rayon, and paper products, including large quantities of cheap goods such as fountain pens, ironware, light bulbs, gambling equipment, toys, and rubber products. The figures gradually increased, with only US$600,000 imported in 1934, US$1.4 million in 1936, US$1.7 million in 1938, and US$1.5 million in 1939. In 1940 and 1941, import and export figures more than doubled, but this increase was due to transshipment to European countries.</p>
<h3>Australian Rocket Experiments Kept Secret</h3>
<p>[Reuter, Sydney, 24th] The Australian authorities have taken strict precautionary measures to prevent any leakage of information about the rocket experiments being conducted in the Emu Field area. The Federal Bureau of Investigation under the Ministry of Justice has recently hired 21 additional detectives, bringing the total number of investigators to 100, led by Colonel Lloyd, who has just returned from Japan, to be responsible for prevention. All scientists participating in the experiments will be given strict protection, and British scientists have been given special bodyguards to prevent suspicious people from contacting them.</p>
<h3>Wreckage of Missing Philippine Plane Found in Mountains</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Manila, 25th] President Roxas of the Philippines' special plane "Lilian Marlene", carrying several important Philippine officials, suddenly went missing. After a week, the mystery has apparently been solved tonight. According to Major Grassett, who is in charge of searching for the missing plane, five planes dispatched in search reported that they had found the wreckage of the recently missing plane on a peak about thirteen miles west of the summit of Mount Ragang in central Mindanao. The numbers of the President's special plane were clearly visible. The plane crashed into the mountain peak at an altitude of about 5,300 feet and was burned. One wing was broken and fell on a mountain peak 200 feet below. There were no signs of survivors nearby.</p>
<h3>U.S. Advisor to Korea Arrives in China; Syngman Rhee Denies Secret Agreement with U.S.</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 24th] Panfield, Deputy Director of the Far Eastern Division of the U.S. State Department, arrived here at the end of last month to serve as an advisor to the Joint Commission. Yesterday, he suddenly flew to Nanjing, his mission unknown. State Department officials here said that Panfield will return here on Wednesday.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 24th] Korean right-wing leader Syngman Rhee recently issued a statement to the press, flatly denying that he had any secret agreement with the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 25th] Korean right-wing leader Syngman Rhee met with the press today and expressed his agreement that Korean political leaders should work with the US-Soviet Joint Commission to promote the establishment of a provisional government. He said: "I am not against the commission, nor am I against others discussing with the commission, but I am not eager to participate, because I do not understand the form of trusteeship and I believe that the US and the Soviet Union have conflicting definitions of democracy." Rhee expressed indifference to the resumption of negotiations by the commission. He said: "The commission's attempt to make Korea independent has failed once, and the Korean people have no reason to rely on the commission." U.S. military commander in South Korea, General Hodge, criticized Rhee's remarks, saying that Rhee seemed to be gradually understanding the situation.</p>
<h3>U.S. and Soviet Union Reach Agreement on News Reporting Methods</h3>
<p>U.S. Representative to US-Soviet Commission Announces</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 25th] U.S. representative to the US-Soviet Joint Commission, Mr. Brown, announced today that the U.S. and the Soviet Union have reached a consensus on the issue of publicly releasing information about the meetings of the Joint Commission, that is, although the progress of the meetings can be released, it will not be done in the form of official communiqués.</p>
<h3>Soviet Member of World Federation of Trade Unions Accuses U.S. Authorities in Korea</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 24th] Soviet member of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Tarasov, declared today that when members of the Executive Committee recently visited South Korea, the U.S. occupying forces made every effort to hinder their investigation. On one occasion, two Korean workers who wanted to welcome the Executive Committee were beaten. Afterwards, according to Brigadier General Brown of the U.S. Army, this was common in Korea and not surprising. In addition to myself, the members of the Executive Committee who visited Korea also included representatives from the United States, Britain, and France. The U.S. side suggested adding military translators and two U.S. military officers, but the Executive Committee refused for obvious reasons. This trip left a painful impression. There were no Korean trade union members at the airport except for U.S. military officers. On the way into the city, a team of Koreans, numbering 30, were met, waving flags in welcome. But the driver accelerated, and the team chased after them in the dust. Although the French member intended to stop the car, he was stopped by a U.S. military officer sitting next to him. According to Korean sources, it was not easy for them to learn from the U.S. side the time of the Executive Committee's arrival. All industries in South Korea are in the hands of the Americans, and they are operating in cooperation with the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Japanese Imagination of a Peace Treaty: Plan to Prevent Transfer of Important Islands to Other Countries; Not Allowing Allied Governments to Interfere in Japanese Internal Affairs</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has completed a 194-page report discussing "Basic Issues of Japanese Economic Recovery," "Classification of Reparations Issues," "Living Standards and the Japanese Economy," and even "Hypothetical Peace Treaty," which represents Japan's hopes and goals for the peace conference. The Central News Agency reporter has exclusively learned that the Japanese government's hypothetical peace treaty, which is only for the reference of Japanese officials, is mostly modeled on the peace treaty with Italy.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs advocates that after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, Japan should join the United Nations as soon as possible. Japan is willing to return the leased territories in Northeast China and Kwantung to China, and return South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union, but it is still prepared to contend for the smaller islands closer to mainland Japan. They will try to prevent the transfer of sovereignty over certain islands, such as the Ryukyu Islands and certain Japanese mandated territories, to other countries. If Japan is allowed to join the United Nations, they would like to place these islands under UN trusteeship, with Japan as the trustee.</p>
<p>They believe that the Allied countries will withdraw their troops except for retaining some smaller constabulary units. They believe that there is a great difference between the current "occupation forces" and the "garrison forces" after the signing of the peace treaty, as the latter will support non-military supervisory agencies to monitor Japan's implementation of the peace treaty. They expect this supervisory agency to be located in important areas, with branches stationed in Hokkaido and Kyushu. They expect that the nationwide occupation, with current Allied personnel stationed throughout Japan, will not continue.</p>
<p>If an international court sentences Japanese war criminals to death, Japan hopes that the Allied countries will entrust it with the final execution of these individuals. For the thousands of war criminals with lesser charges, the country also hopes to try them if the terms of the peace treaty allow.</p>
<p>The ideal peace treaty with Japan, as considered by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is one where Japan's sovereignty is unrestricted, Allied countries are not allowed to interfere in Japanese internal affairs, and economic restrictions will be specifically stipulated in the peace treaty documents. Wartime industries will of course not be allowed to exist, and industries and enterprises that can be converted to military use will also be restricted. It is assumed that the peace treaty with Japan will also stipulate figures for other sectors of the Japanese economy. However, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that Japan's various economic needs require an annual steel production of 10 million tons, a textile industry with 5 million spindles, and an export industry worth 3.4 billion yen based on 1941 prices in order to survive.</p>
<p>The extent to which the terms of the US draft peace treaty with Japan are close to the draft hypothetical peace treaty self-determined by Japan is the most concerning issue for the eleven countries harmed by the Japanese militarists. And they all want to obtain guarantees that various conditions and environments that can enable Japan to restore its imperial ideology will not develop.</p>
<h3>French Premier Issues Order Requisitioning Coal and Electricity Industries; Government and Unions Face Test</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] French Prime Minister Ramadier signed an order today authorizing the government to requisition the employees and equipment of the national gas and electricity companies. This measure, decided by the Cabinet today, will be published in tomorrow's "Official Gazette." The French gas and electricity workers, because the government authorities refused to approve a 25% wage increase, decided to strike for 24 hours on the 28th of this month, stopping the supply of gas and reducing the national electricity supply to a minimum. For this reason, the French Cabinet held a meeting today and decided to take the above measures to cope with the situation. In addition, it is reported that strikes and demonstrations have occurred repeatedly in various provinces today, but they are not large-scale. Two or three hundred thousand railway workers in Lyon marched in procession today, to the city government to demand improved food supply. Four hundred construction workers in Versailles were dismissed by the capitalists for carrying out a "slowdown" in order to demand higher wages. Workers at the Normandy Bus Company also went on strike to demand better treatment.</p>
<p>[Reuter, Paris, 25th] The French gas and electricity workers' work slowdown and the government's announcement of the takeover of the national gas and electricity plants and their workers is the biggest test of strength between the government authorities and the unions since the liberation of France. The notice of the takeover of the gas and electricity workers will be posted in public places throughout the country today. The plan on how to deal with possible riots and ensure the supply of gas and electricity was decided last night by the Cabinet in consultation with the General Staff and French industrial leaders. Although the authorities denied that the French Army had been ordered to remain in camp and not go out to deal with the labor unrest, it is generally believed that similar precautionary measures have indeed been taken. The gas and electricity labor unrest seems to be an isolated labor unrest caused by the failure to demand a 23% wage increase, but observers believe that this labor unrest is a prelude to a comprehensive labor unrest that will suffocate the French economy.</p>
<p>Determined to Prevent Labor Unrest</p>
<p>The gas and electricity union has stipulated Wednesday as the first day of complete work stoppage, which is also the last day for a satisfactory answer to the demand for improved working conditions nationwide, and also the day for the national Federation of Trade Unions to decide whether to accept the government's decision on Thursday not to consider a general wage increase before December 1. The government today is clearly facing the threat of a general strike. The fundamental problem is not in adjusting the labor unrest to the demands of a unit, but in the power of the government. Under the union's open challenge, whether it can maintain the government's position is still unusually firm so far. Minister of Industrial Production Lacoste said last night, "In the next few days, the country will see the government's determination to govern the country." The French government has previously stated unequivocally that in order to save the collapse of the French franc and make the price of French goods able to compete with international commodities, no wage increases will be allowed before December this year. The Cabinet believes that workers who do not accept this policy are openly rebelling against the government authorities. Labor unrest has been brewing in all major industries across the country in the past few months, and after the Communist Party withdrew from the coalition cabinet three weeks ago, the labor unrest reached a boiling point.</p>
<p>Unpredictable Consequences of Accepting the Challenge</p>
<p>This gas and electricity labor unrest is a test of strength between the union and the government. Now that the government has accepted the workers' challenge, if the result cannot grasp the situation, it will have a significant impact on the French political situation. In the case of this gas and electricity labor unrest alone, Prime Minister Ramadier has the support of the cabinet members of the Social Radical and Popular Republican parties, but on a broader level, Ramadier is not only facing the opposition of the Communist Party, but also facing the opposition of a part of the Socialist Party, because there are still differences of opinion within the Socialist Party on the attitude to be taken towards the union. In addition to political struggles, the general public, who do not care about politics, is also dissatisfied with the government due to the difficulties of daily life. For example, the lack of bread and meat, the increase in living expenses, and the constraints of the bureaucratic system on the people are all enough to drive the people into an environment of universal disappointment and naturally tend to seek another "savior."</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Bevin Scheduled to Visit Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuter, Essen, Germany, 24th] Officials of the North German Coal Control Board announced tonight that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will come to the British zone of Germany next month for a fact-finding inspection. Bevin also plans to address a German public assembly in the Ruhr area. British Minister for German Occupied Territories Lord Pakenham met today with German miners' leaders, coal mine managers, and British coal officials at the North German Coal Control Board. Lord Pakenham said at the meeting that the whole world is watching the increase in coal production in the Ruhr, which is most helpful to Germany's recovery of its reputation in the world. Coal production in the Ruhr has now dropped sharply to 200,000 tons per day.</p>
<h3>U.S. Recruiting Workers to Build Airport in Northern Region</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, San Francisco, 25th] U.S. World Airways plans to use commercial airplanes this year to transport 2,500 construction workers from Seattle to Fairbanks, Alaska. These workers, contracted by several Seattle companies with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, are recruited from all over the United States and plan to engage in large-scale airport facility construction near Fairbanks.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Exploiting Uranium Mines in Germany</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Prague, 24th] According to news from the Aue district of German territory occupied by the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union is stepping up mining in the northern corner of the famous Joachimsthal mining area. The intensified mining of uranium ore sand, which is atomic material, almost means that new discoveries have been made. Czech scientist Madam Curie first discovered uranium ore sand there and refined radium ingots. According to reports, the mine is exclusively mined by Soviet miners, and the exact location and excavation situation of the mine are kept strictly secret. The Joachimsthal mine in Czech territory was mined by Germany during the war and was taken over by the Czech government after liberation. In 1937, the production volume was 158,000 tons of raw ore sand. At present, due to insufficient equipment, the production volume has decreased. The Czech government said that the ore sand produced is exclusively for the manufacture of uranium and medical ingots, and the Czech side is not conducting atomic energy research.</p>
<h3>U.S. Discovers Large Uranium Deposits</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The Senate said: The United States has discovered very large uranium deposits, necessary for the manufacture of atomic bombs, in the Colorado River Basin. The Atomic Energy Commission also said that after this discovery, the United States may no longer need to rely on external supplies.</p>
<h3>Imminent British Labour Party Congress: Internal Conflicts Intensify, Sides Launch Ideological War</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] The British Labour Party is about to hold a congress in Margate, and because it will intensify the conflict between supporters and opponents of the Labour government's general foreign policy, the attention of political figures is focused on this conference. Observers say that the two sides have already launched a kind of ideological war in the past few weeks. "Rebel" Labour MP leader Crossman has distributed a pamphlet entitled "Keep Left," while the other side has issued a pamphlet entitled "Cards on the Table." The latter pamphlet, without the approval of the Labour Party Executive Committee and as a formal statement, is likely to cause fierce debate. In addition, the terms of office of some members of the Labour Party Executive Committee have expired and need to be re-elected. This point is also worth noting. Lord President of the Council Morrison, Minister of Fuel and Power Shinwell, Foreign Secretary Bevin, and Crossman are all on the list of candidates. According to other sources, a cabinet reshuffle may be imminent, and Prime Minister Attlee will provide accurate information to Parliament on this matter.</p>
<h3>British Lord President of the Council Asks Labour Party to Respect Itself</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] Lord President of the Council Morrison warned the Labour Party today to guard against excessive selfishness. He stated briefly that excessive self-interest is detrimental to us. The Conservative Party's recently published Industrial Charter has made a great contribution to British socialism. It can be seen that the various principles of socialism have gradually been accepted by public opinion.</p>

<h3>Opening of the Municipal Council Congress; Speaker Submits Four Proposals; Requesting the Return of Dalian and Macau; Citizens Write to the Council Opposing Rent Increases</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The third general meeting of the first session of the Municipal Council will be held this morning. The opening ceremony will be held from 9:00 to 10:00, and the preparatory meeting will be held from 10:00 to 12:00, and lots will be drawn to determine the seats of the councilors. Responsible persons from various bureaus and departments of the municipal government, as well as local party, government, and military leaders, will be invited to attend.</p>
<p>The secretariat of the council continued to receive five proposals yesterday, but because the council had already completed the sorting of proposals the day before yesterday, the proposals received yesterday will be treated as temporary motions and submitted to the general meeting for discussion. Among the proposals received yesterday, three councilors, Chen Peide, Zhang Zhihan, and Zhao Junhao, suggested seven measures for the municipal government to deal with rising rice prices, the general idea of which is: (1) Establish a number of public rice stores in each district according to the proportion of the population to avoid crowds of rice buyers in one place, making it difficult to purchase rice. (2) Various groups and organizations jointly purchase rice collectively. (3) Please encourage rice merchants to order from overseas. (4) Encourage farmers to grow grains and rice. (5) Before the establishment of public rice stores, the chairman of the district people's congress, Huang Cheng, and the district office will handle the rationing according to the population ratio. (6) Rice weevils seek private gain and disrupt society, and should be severely punished. (7) The Xiao Kuaile case should be requested by this council to the judicial authorities for a fair and thorough investigation.</p>
<p>In addition, three councilors, Zhang Zhihan, Feng Youzhen, and Zhao Junmeng, requested a reiteration of the resolution of the second general meeting of the first session of this council to extend the lease rights of residents allocated to public housing for religious personnel. Councilor Zhuang Ping requested the municipal government to ban vendors from extracting a 30% commission on one yuan bets.</p>
<p>The proposals submitted by the municipal government had not yet reached the council as of last night. There are currently only four proposals submitted by the speaker, but it is understood that the speaker still has many proposals from this inspection of various districts, which will be sent to the general meeting for discussion once they are sorted out. The currently submitted proposals from the speaker are recorded below: (1) To approve the case of the resolution No. 9 of the council's proposal regarding the handling of academic advancement funds, and request a review and reply. Reason: According to the Shanghai Municipal Government's Shanghai Hui Yi (36) Zi No. 12303 official letter, the second general meeting of this council sent the resolution No. 9 of the council's proposal, requesting that the 7.2 billion yuan for academic advancement fees for teachers and social education personnel in municipal primary and secondary schools be included in the 20% education expenditure item in the city's total annual budget, and that those who have already collected from students should be refunded. The Education Bureau immediately transferred the order and reported: "It has been found that the academic advancement fees for teachers and staff in municipal schools and social education institutions at all levels were originally budgeted at 7.2 billion yuan. Later, when the budget for this year was recompiled, the total amount of the bureau's expenditure budget was only 45.8 billion yuan. The allocation of operating expenses and the most needed temporary expenses to the affiliated institutions is already insufficient. If the 7.2 billion yuan for advancement fees is included again, the original business will not be able to be maintained. After repeated consideration, the schools in rural areas that have not yet collected advancement fees were first budgeted at 1.8 billion yuan, and the remaining 5.4 billion yuan that has not been included has been separately budgeted and submitted for special allocation. As for the schools that have already collected advancement fees from students, they have repeatedly reported that they have already been distributed to teachers and staff and must wait for your government's approval. After the additional budget is issued by the bureau, it can be refunded." In addition to including the 1.8 billion yuan for advancement fees in the general budget, a letter was sent to request review and reply, etc., requesting a public decision. (2) To approve the Zhejiang Provincial Council's Zhejiang Er Yi Lin Zi No. 1909 substitute telegram, requesting the central government to use rapid and effective methods to recover Dalian from the Soviet Union, urging unanimous support, and requesting a discussion. (3) To approve the Tianjin Provisional Council's telegram requesting the government to earnestly negotiate with Portugal to recover Macau, urging unanimous support, and requesting a discussion. (4) To approve the telegram requesting a re-determination of the National Assembly representatives for municipalities directly under the central government, changing to one person per district, and allocating one woman among the ten, urging unanimous support, and requesting a discussion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the Municipal Council received a joint letter from citizens Fan Dan, Fang Dong, Qi _, and Jia Zhu yesterday, opposing the city's real estate association, using the excuse that the current standard for housing rent is set too low and demanding a new adjustment. They expressed their indignation at the association's recent tea party to entertain councilors, hoping to use the power of the general meeting to achieve their profiteering conspiracy and monopolize public opinion. They requested that the council pay attention to the fact that the majority of Shanghai citizens live in rented houses, and that all measures should be based on the opinions of the majority of citizens, and should never conform to the greed of a small number of capitalists. They also hoped that the council would launch a city-wide mutual aid association for third-party tenants to connect with each other and prevent large landlords or sub-landlords from arbitrarily increasing rent.</p>
<h3>Last Day of Speaker's Inspection; Rice Rationing Techniques Urgently Need to be Agreed Upon; Hope to Allocate Vacant Land to Build More Schools</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday was the last day of Municipal Council Speaker Pan's visit to various districts. Those accompanying him were still Secretary-General Xiang, and representatives from the Public Works and Health Bureaus. In the morning, they went to the Lao Zha and Huangpu districts, and in the afternoon, they went to the Xincheng and Jing'an districts. Councilors, district chiefs, and chairmen of district representative conferences were all concentrated in the district offices to greet them, and provided many opinions on the current situation of municipal administration and society. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Food rice is the most important and urgent issue in Shanghai at present. The government's monthly allocation of affordable rice is only enough for one-third of the needs of citizens, so the target of affordable rice can only be limited to the extremely poor. However, the technical issue of how to investigate and how to ration the extremely poor, it is hoped that the Social Bureau will convene all district chiefs in the shortest possible time to jointly study a whole set of methods and procedures, with the principle of average, simple, and fast.</p>
<p>District Bao Institutions - Insufficient Funds</p>
<p>(2) District Bao institutions are the grassroots organizations of the country, and the government and the people should attach great importance to them. At present, the Shanghai District Bao offices do not have fixed houses. District offices mostly rent private houses and temples, or borrow one or two rooms in police stations. The Bao office only sets up a desk in the private house of the Bao chief, and the monthly office expenses are not enough to pay for water and electricity, let alone implement administrative district orders. It is hoped that the government and the people can cooperate earnestly to correct this kind of upside-down pagoda formation. (3) People are very interested in dedicating schools to celebrate birthdays. Each district has raised considerable funds. Lao Zha district has decided to raise 2 billion yuan to build school buildings. It is hoped that the municipal government can allocate vacant land to build school buildings.</p>
<p>Lane Roads - Hope for Repairs</p>
<p>(4) The roads in the city's lanes are severely damaged. It is hoped that the government can cooperate with the people to repair them, and that the practice of urinating and defecating everywhere, dumping garbage, and building flat houses along the lanes to block the streets can be effectively banned. (5) Chengdu North Road, Shanhai Pass Road, and Xinchang Road are all severely damaged and need to be repaired. (6) The Zhangjiabang in Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road is a stinky water pond, which is extremely harmful to the health of citizens. It is hoped that the government can cooperate with the people to fill it. (7) There is no municipal hospital in Jing'an Temple District. It is hoped that there will be a health clinic.</p>
<h3>Newly Manufactured Tricycles - Please Issue Licenses from the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Unemployed Rickshaw Pullers Petition the Council</p>
<p>Since the municipal government restricted the operation of tricycles, more than 1,320 newly manufactured vehicles by various car dealers in the city have been abandoned for a long time. The Northern Jiangsu refugees and unemployed workers who are waiting for the licenses for these vehicles to make a living also hope that the vehicles can be licensed for rent, so they organized a petition group and sent representatives to petition the council yesterday, requesting the continued issuance of business licenses. The following three reasons were presented: (1) The municipal government does not consider continuing to issue tricycle licenses due to traffic congestion in the central district, but it should be considered whether other areas besides the central district are also congested, and whether there is still a great need for transportation. (2) It is unreasonable to refuse to adopt compromise measures to relieve unemployed poor people simply because of traffic congestion in one corner of the central district. (3) Please find a way out of no way, and issue licenses that do not allow driving in the central district, that is, the area "east to the Bund, south to Jinling Road, west to Tibet Road, and north to Suzhou Creek" may be designated as a prohibited area.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Traitor Assets Awaiting Sale</h3>
<p>A large batch of medicines, foreign wines, soaps, cigarettes, medical cotton, gauze, and other materials seized and kept in custody by the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office will be publicly auctioned. The details of the materials are as follows: More than 1,340 pieces of Pan Ni's rubber plasters, morphine injections, surgical instruments, alcohol, gauze, cotton, etc., from the three provinces and two fluorescent lamps. Eight bundles of Liang Ni Hongzhi's Lian Shi paper. Two boxes of Yu Ni Aizhen's foreign wine. Twelve _ of Lu Ni Yingshang's wine. 150 boxes of Qian Ni Da_'s medicines, five boxes of Xiangmao soap, two boxes of whiskey, and one box of Xiaopaotai cigarettes. Thirteen boxes of Chen Ni Xingcun's soap, more than 1,400 injections of glucose, and 16 bottles of _'s Neng. Three boxes of Zheng Ni Liangbin's glass bricks and 53 coils of large and small purple steel wire. More than 700 pieces of Zhu Ni Dunlin's _ shirts and military blankets. And 50 boxes of Yu Ni Shao_'s cigars. It is said that some of this batch of treasures are currently unavailable in various markets.</p>
<h3>No Price Increase Decided for Passenger and Freight Transport on Two Railways</h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Monthly Subsidy of 5.4 Billion</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration previously requested the Ministry of Communications to forward a request to the Executive Yuan to adjust fares because revenue and expenditure could not be balanced and business could not be promoted. Recently, due to the _ meeting's _ passing of public utilities, it was decided to adopt a subsidy policy, so it has been instructed that passenger and freight fares should be maintained at the original price and not increased. It is now learned that, in order to balance revenue and expenditure on the two railways and promote business, the Ministry of Communications has recently decided to subsidize the two railways by 5.4 billion yuan per month, which will be officially implemented from this month.</p>
<h3>Two Railway Bureaus Begin Replacing Railway Tracks on the Nanxiang-Kunshan Section</h3>
<p>The repeated derailments of trains on the two railways were mainly caused by sleepers and _ _. In order to ensure the safety of train operation, the bureau specially requested the Ministry of Communications to issue 30 kilometers of 90-pound _ tracks. The upper _ arrived happily. In addition to reserving 8 kilometers for replacing the main crossovers of the stations on the Shanghai-Nanjing line, the remaining 22 kilometers began to be selectively replaced with old tracks in the Nanxiang-Kunshan area yesterday. It is expected that all of them will be replaced by the end of June. It is learned that the bureau has ordered a large batch of new steel rails from the United States, which will be shipped soon, and all the steel rails on the entire line of the two railways can be completely replaced.</p>
<h3>Jin Chao Case Continues to be Heard Today</h3>
<p>Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren _ Will Be Summoned to Court</p>
<p>The District Court is scheduled to continue hearing the Jin Chao case at 2:00 p.m. today. The defendants Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren, who have been released on bail, will be summoned to court at that time. The courtroom, which has been silent for a long time, will be full of spectators again today.</p>
<h3>Chen Bozhuang Invites Transporters to Discuss the Issue of Freight Business Offices on the Two Railways</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration previously discussed the issue of freight business offices with representatives of transportation industry associations in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. Because the Railway Administration was unable to fully accept the four principles it proposed, there was no result. It is learned that yesterday, Chen Bozhuang, director of the two railway bureaus, sent staff to invite Li Mulian, chairman of the Shanghai Transportation Industry Association, to the bureau for discussion, earnestly expressing his willingness to resolve this issue with a frank attitude, and submitted written opinions, stipulating two new methods. However, the Shanghai transporters believe that this matter must be discussed with their counterparts in Nanjing and Hangzhou before they can reply.</p>

<h3>Inter-Student Fight Occurs at Jiaotong University</h3>
<p>According to information from the Xujiahui Police Station yesterday, Jiaotong University students held a meeting at 9:00 p.m. last night. Due to a conflict of opinions between students who opposed the strike and students who insisted on the strike, an inter-student fight occurred. Some people on both sides were injured. Among them, Qin Mingsao, Hua Zemin, and Zhang Hanwei were more seriously injured. The students notified the Xujiahui Police Station by telegram. At that time, a patrolling policeman passed by and heard fighting and arguing in the school, so he entered to maintain order and sent the injured students to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Theatre Ceiling Collapses, Injuring Many Guests; Radio Broadcasts of Strange Advertisements and "Wonderful Articles" Become Prophecies</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Guotai Yue Opera Theatre at 451 Tibet Road staged the new play "It's My Fault" starring Bi Dangui and Xu Yulan last night. The audience was quite crowded, and it was full before the show even started. Unexpectedly, at 10:35 p.m., when the play was about to end in the third act, the ceiling on the west side collapsed due to continuous heavy rain, poor construction, and the unbearable vibration of electric fans. Fortunately, before the collapse, there was a huge sound, followed by the scattering of ash and sand, so the audience on the west side was able to dodge in time, avoiding a major disaster. Only 17 men and women were injured, which was a great fortune in misfortune. After the incident, the Baike Road Military Police and the Xincheng Police Station sent a large number of personnel to the scene to suppress the situation and quickly sent the injured to the China-US, Hongren, and Renji hospitals. The injured included Wang Suqin, 32 years old, Qian Meimei, 9 years old, Ding Lu's, 32 years old, Ding Li's, 32 years old, Xu Wang's, 32 years old, Jin Boliang, 17 years old, Xu Didi, 1 year old, Fang Xia Cuiyuan, 30 years old, Zhang Cai's, 42 years old, Gao Guoping, 3 years old, Fang Chengde, 41 years old, Chen Wu's, 36 years old, Lu Ying, 19 years old, Shen Xiang's, 51 years old, Shen Xinlian, 15 years old, Hua Wenying, 24 years old, and Fang Zhang's, 36 years old, etc. All were discharged from the hospital that night after being bandaged by the various hospitals. At the moment of the collapse, the audience was extremely chaotic due to the rush to escape. Most of the female guests forgot their coats and bags, and some of them lost valuable ornaments and cash, so there were still many female guests standing outside the theatre late at night, negotiating compensation with the theatre. During the chaos, some unscrupulous people rushed into the field to "loot while the fire was burning," and two people were arrested by the police. However, most of the recovered coats and bags are now stored in the theatre's accounting room and will be handed over to the police station for handling. In addition, the advertisement published by the theatre in various newspapers yesterday had the words "Crowded audience, few seats, poor facilities, it's my fault," which unexpectedly became a prophecy. At the same time, in order to make the play "It's My Fault" appeal to the audience, the evening show was rebroadcast to the city by Tiefeng Electric, so the earliest to receive the news when the incident occurred were the radio listeners.</p>

<h3>Increasing Production to Save the Crisis; The Re-establishment of the National Products Manufacturers Association; Passing the Constitution and Electing Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The re-establishment general meeting of the Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association was held at the Jingu Hotel at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 100 units of manufacturer representatives attended. After the formalities, the chairman of the presidium, Wang Xiaolai, said in his speech that the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association was established in 1930, with the purpose of promoting national products and consolidating the national foundation. In recent years, the association's affairs have made considerable progress. During the Anti-Japanese War, manufacturers held the heart of saving the country with national products, assisted the Anti-Japanese War, and made a lot of contributions.</p>
<p>From the victory to today, under the severe economic crisis situation, oppressed by high prices, high interest rates, high donations and taxes, and high wages, all manufacturers are in danger. To save ourselves and the country, we must promote national products and increase production to save the crisis. The future tasks of the association are to handle the production and sales cooperation of national products, investigate and count statistics, handle the export of products and the import of necessary raw materials, and establish a national product joint service center, etc. We will strive tirelessly according to the needs of the national economy to assist the industrialization of the country. Subsequently, Ge Futian reported on the preparations, and representatives from the Social Bureau, Zou Jinkui, Zhou Lianze, representative from the Municipal Party Department, and Wang Guanqing, representative from Mayor Wu, delivered speeches successively. Then, the constitution was passed, and Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, Ge Futian, Pan Shihao, Jin Runxiang and other 25 people were elected as directors, and Hu Xiyuan and other 5 people were elected as alternate directors. Xu Xiaochu, Rong Hongyuan and other 7 people were elected as supervisors. Shi Zhifu and other three people were elected as alternate supervisors. Finally, the photo session was completed, and the meeting adjourned at about 6:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Labor-Capital Disputes at Two Rubber Factories</h3>
<p>The wages of workers in the Xinsheng Rubber Factory on Fanhuangdu Road have never been stipulated with a base salary. The workers requested to improve this, and there was no result in the discussion with the factory. In addition, the Zhaoning Road Dafu Rubber Factory owed the workers a differential of March and April, and wages for March, April, and May. After both parties negotiated on their own, the wages have now been paid, but the differential and the wages for the first period of May have not been paid. At present, the workers of the two factories are requesting the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to mediate through the Rubber Industry Union of the Third District.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Suspension of Three Newspapers; The Iron Newspaper's Report is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>According to the Iron Newspaper of this city yesterday, the suspension of Wenhui, United, and Xinmin newspapers "was approved by Chairman Chiang for execution." The spokesperson of the Preparatory Headquarters yesterday issued a solemn statement stating: "The headquarters' order to suspend Wenhui, United, and Xinmin newspapers this time was because the newspapers successively published news that harmed military affairs, and remarks and news that attempted to subvert the government and disrupt public order. This city is a martial law area, and in order to leave _ social order and protect the lives and property of the people, we had to suspend their publication. The Iron Newspaper's _ that it was approved by Chairman Gao for execution, etc., is completely inaccurate. In addition to giving the newspaper an appropriate punishment, we hereby solemnly declare to correct the hearing."</p>

<h3>市工務局長播講 上海的修路難 主要在錢其次努力最後還得市民愛護</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] This newspaper, yesterday at the Gospel Radio Station (broadcast by the United Broadcasting Station on its behalf), held the eighth special weekly broadcast, inviting the Director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhao Zukang, to broadcast on "The Difficulty of Road Repair in Shanghai." Here is a record of his speech: Those who go out on the road often quote the phrase "The road to Shu is as difficult as ascending to the blue sky." In my opinion, the difficulty of road repair in Shanghai is truly worthy of being described as "more difficult than ascending to the blue sky." This difficulty is multifaceted and not simple. It is like an illness that requires internal medicine, surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and all other departments. It is a combination of all diseases and cannot be cured with a simple prescription or relying solely on "bloody courage."</p>
<p>Shanghai has a total of five or six hundred "roads," with a total length of nine hundred kilometers, which is equivalent to going from Shanghai to Nanjing, from Nanjing to Hangzhou, and then back to Shanghai from Hangzhou. The total length of this triangle, in terms of area, is that Shanghai's roads have a total of seven and a half million square meters, which is more than 11,000 municipal acres. These roads were not planned in one period, nor were they designed with the same goal.</p>
<p>Director of the Public Works Bureau Zhao Zukang (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<p>New Needs, Various Difficulties</p>
<p>Now we feel that the road system is not rational enough, the road width is not wide enough, and the road structure is not strong enough. The congestion of the central district's roads and the unevenness of many secondary roads are the consequences of the sudden increase in traffic volume and the sudden increase in load. To enhance the road's ability to absorb traffic, we must improve the road system, add new routes, and widen roads to meet the needs of traffic volume. However, every time we plan to widen a road, there are more than a dozen agencies to consult and report to, and the general owners and residents can also express many different opinions because of their own interests. As for strengthening the road structure and renovating it, it is not a simple matter. One can imagine how much money it will take to renovate. So I say that meeting new needs has various difficulties.</p>
<p>Soaring Prices of Road Construction Materials</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the difficulties of labor and materials. The Public Works Bureau regularly employs more than 5,000 long-term workers, but less than 2,000 of them can actually go on the road to repair roads. Because of the meager salary, the efficiency of these workers will not be very high. We can only seek some remedies in terms of material and spirit to overcome this difficulty. In terms of materials, the prices of asphalt, tar, cement, gravel, and yellow sand have soared to an alarming extent. The most difficult thing to deal with is the speed of the increase, which makes our budget unable to keep up. With such fluctuating prices, contractors are discouraged and dare not undertake projects. There is often a risk of material shortages. Without materials, how can road repair work proceed? Our solution to the material difficulty is to try our best to ensure the long-term stability of material supply, so that both the merchants supplying materials and our Public Works Bureau can reduce unexpected losses. Our efforts in this area have made considerable progress. Road construction is technical and requires specialized equipment and tools. When we took over after the victory, there were 52 road rollers, but they were all old and broken. There were three asphalt plants, but only one was barely usable. Now two large plants have been repaired, and several stone crushers have also been repaired before they can be used. However, when it is not easy to settle foreign exchange, we should increase the number of road construction machines, but we have been unable to do so.</p>
<p>Priority in Repairing</p>
<p>In addition, there is a difficulty in terms of social awareness. Our order of priority in repairing roads is to first repair the roads on the streetcar and bus routes in the city, while also paying attention to the arterial roads in the suburbs that connect to important towns in all four directions from the central district. Some people think that it is unequal that we only repair roads for cars, which is a misunderstanding. Some people are dissatisfied when they see that the roads they often pass have not been repaired. There are too many roads in Shanghai, and they are in too bad a condition. Even if we are given sufficient money, we still need sufficient time to repair them.</p>
<p>There is an even greater difficulty, which is that a small number of citizens do not cherish the roads. For example, littering fruit peels and nutshells on the road, and even sugarcane residue, is harmful to the maintenance of the road. Also, pouring water from washing clothes and emptying chamber pots on the road, as well as the water from vegetable stalls and faucets, universally soaks the road surface, which can increase the speed of road damage. Moreover, the siltation of ditches causes water to accumulate on the road on rainy days, which is also a reason for road damage. This kind of acquired difficulty is also something that our Public Works Bureau cannot overcome. It requires the understanding and cooperation of the citizens.</p>
<p>In short, to solve the difficulty of road repair in Shanghai, first, we need money, second, we need our efforts, and third, we need the understanding and love of the citizens."</p>
<h3>Night and Day, Many Programs</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the eighth special broadcast of this newspaper, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. There were many special programs, such as Dr. Zhong Zhihe's lecture on "Tuberculosis and Insomnia," the harmonica ensemble of the China Harmonica Society (led by Wang Qinglong), legal knowledge with barrister Xi Yaofu lecturing on "Lease Issues," Gao Yifei, the person in charge of the Shanghai Chess Department of the China Chess Society, lecturing on "Blind Chess" (Ma Jun is good at chess and can play two games simultaneously with his eyes closed), and the celebrity lecture by Director Zhao Zukang on "The Difficulty of Road Repair in Shanghai." In the evening, the gentlemen of the Yinquan Opera Society and all the members of the Yangchun Society broadcast Kunqu Opera and Peking Opera, performing different programs, each excelling in their own field, making it a feast for the ears.</p>
<h3>Liang Hongzhi Hidden Valuable Books Seized Tens of Thousands of Volumes Confiscated and Reported to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>When the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office recently conducted a general investigation of Liang Hongzhi's property, it received a tip that the traitor was still hiding a large number of antiques, stationery, and books. It sent personnel to investigate the address and found tens of thousands of volumes of valuable books, which were of great value. Since these books belonged to the traitor Liang, they should be confiscated in accordance with the regulations on the handling of traitorous property, together with the High Procuratorate, and reported to the Executive Yuan for review and instructions, awaiting disposal.</p>
<h3>Newly Established Stores Allowed to Open First with Receipt Certificate for License Application</h3>
<p>The Finance Bureau previously stipulated that anyone engaged in business should apply to the business license tax collection agency for investigation, registration, determination of the tax amount, collection of taxes, and issuance of a business license before the business starts, and then be allowed to open. Therefore, newly established stores, even after applying for a license, could not open before receiving the license, and the capital was held up for a long time, resulting in significant losses. It is now learned that: in order to facilitate merchants, the Finance Bureau has specially stipulated that those who apply for a business license for a newly established store may be given a receipt certificate by the tax collection agency after the application has been submitted, allowing them to open first, and then issue the license after the tax is assessed and paid. However, the validity period of the certificate is limited to one month.</p>

<h3>Dredging Bureau's Work in Progress</h3>
<p>Restoring Pre-War Levels in the Short Term</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dredging Bureau is actively carrying out dredging work to gradually improve the depth and width of the navigation channels in the port of Shanghai and to restore them to pre-war levels in the shortest possible time. It is reported that the bureau's recent dredging volume has been increasing monthly, with a total of 307,897 cubic yards in the past month, which is more than 85% of the highest pre-war record. The dredging volume for this month to the end of this week is 220,000 cubic yards, and it is expected that it will increase to about 300,000 cubic yards by the end of the month. The general situation of the bureau's work is briefly described as follows: (1) The large bucket ladder dredger Haihu is dispatched to undertake the dredging project of the Third Ship Repair Plant of the Pudong China Merchants Bureau and the Gonghexing Wharf.

<h3>Workers' Leave for Marriage and Funerals Wages Should Still be Paid Social Department Approves Detailed Measures</h3>
<p>The leave granted to workers in various factories in this city for marriage and funerals is quite inconsistent, or there are no regulations at all, which often leads to disputes between the two parties. The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee, in view of this, decided at the eighth meeting of the committee to draft temporary measures for the leave granted to workers and their relatives in Shanghai factories for marriage and funerals, and submitted them to the Ministry of Social Affairs for review and instructions. The committee recently received an order from the Ministry of Social Affairs, which stated that the measures were still acceptable and had been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and permission was granted for filing. The committee has now issued a formal notice to all factories in the city for implementation. The original measures are recorded as follows: (1) The leave granted to workers and their relatives in Shanghai factories for marriage and funerals shall be governed by these measures, unless otherwise provided by laws and regulations. (2) The regulations on the leave for marriage and funerals of workers and their relatives are as follows: 1. Five days of marriage leave for the worker, 2. Two days for children, 3. Five days of leave for the funeral of parents or spouse, 4. Three days of leave for the funeral of grandparents. If both parents are deceased and no one is handling their funeral, five days of leave may be granted, 5. Those who have a long journey may be granted additional travel leave, which shall be determined by the factory. (3) Workers in factories shall be paid their wages during the prescribed marriage and funeral leave period. (4) Workers who are paid by the piece may refer to the provisions of these measures. (5) Factories that have already established leave measures for marriage and funerals before the implementation of these measures shall still follow the original measures. (6) Temporary workers and contractors are not subject to these measures.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation</h3>
<p>(1) Debt Dispute</p>
<p>Zhou Tianjian asks: A lends his savings over the years to his friend B to lend out, with a monthly interest of one dime (i.e. 10%). B then lends it to C at a high interest rate, and C issues a loan agreement, but the interest rate is not stated on the agreement, and D stamps it as a guarantor. Now C is suffering heavy losses in business. B has repeatedly urged him to repay the loan, but to no avail. He asks (1) Can he demand payment from the guarantor? (2) If D ignores him, can he use the goods in his store as compensation? (3) If D is unwilling, what procedures should he follow to obtain payment?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) D is in the position of a guarantor and should bear the responsibility of guaranteeing the debt. If the principal debtor C cannot repay the debt, he can request D to repay it on his behalf. (2) Buying items from D is another matter. If he uses the loan agreement he guaranteed as compensation, it cannot be done legally unless D himself agrees. (3) B should request C to pay off the loan. If C cannot repay the loan, D should repay it on his behalf.</p>
<p>(2) Absolute Sale and Redemption</p>
<p>He Kezhen asks: In 1944, I bought a house with a plot of land from A through a friend's introduction. At that time, A (selling his ancestral property absolutely) had a written agreement. The broker B and his clansmen signed and sealed the agreement on the spot. In 1945, A passed away. The following year, A's wife sent a letter stating that part of the property sold by her husband belonged to her personal property and she now intends to redeem it, and sent a photo of the property division contract, which was signed and sealed by the broker B and his clansmen A, etc. Please ask (1) Is this kind of sale illegal under the law? (2) Is the flower signature signed by A himself for the absolute sale of his ancestral property still valid? (because A has passed away) (3) Since the broker B and A's clansmen testified on the contract of division between A and his wife, why did they testify again when A sold the property? From a legal point of view, is the behavior of B and his clansmen legal?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) If the house and land belong to A personally, the sale is of course legal. (2) The signature of A on the absolute sale contract is of course valid under the law. (3) The broker and A's clansmen have signed and sealed the absolute sale contract, and they should bear the responsibility of proving it under the law.</p>

<h3>Provincial Science Investigation Team Left for Orchid Island Yesterday A Group of More Than Sixty People Carried More Than Sixty Tons of Instruments</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th] The "Science Investigation Team" organized by the National Taiwan University and the Provincial Marine Research Institute, Tuberculosis Research Institute, Geological Survey, Meteorological Bureau, Museum and other academic institutions, a group of more than sixty people, led by Dr. Ma Tingying, Director of the Marine Research Institute and Director of the Department of Geology of National Taiwan University, and Professor Chen Lijie, Director of the affiliated hospital of National Taiwan University, carrying a total of more than sixty tons of instruments, left Taipei for Keelung this morning, taking a special ship via Taitung Fire Island to Orchid Island (formerly known as Red Head Island), which is rich in raw materials for lung medicine but has no patients with lung disease, to conduct surveys of marine meteorology, animals and plants, anthropology, and medicine. The island is shaped like a pill, located in the southeast of He Wan Island, and its south is the Philippine Islands, about fifty nautical miles from Taitung. The island has an area of only forty-eight square kilometers, all of which are mountainous areas, formed by submarine volcanic eruptions in the third century. There are many streams and springs on the island, and the temperature is lower than Manila, but slightly higher than Hengchun. The products include the rare lung medicine raw material "Red Head Orchid." There are only more than 2,000 indigenous Ami people living on the island. Before the Pacific War, Dr. Hasegawa and others of the Japanese Medical Science Department went to the island one after another to conduct physical examinations of the residents and test the residents' reactions to tuberculin, all of which were "negative." The results of this test were highly valued by the medical community and regarded as a sacred place for treating lung diseases, because lung patients have "positive" reactions when they undergo the same test. The island is also located in the Kuroshio Current area of the Pacific Ocean, where there are many aquatic products and fish, which are regarded as the "virgin land" of the ocean by production scientists. At the same time, the bird is the first place where typhoons pass, and its position in meteorological observation is also extremely important. Last year, a typhoon caused a major disaster in Taiwan, and some people believed that it was caused by the interruption of meteorological observation work on the island.</p>
<h3>School News Across the Country: Chaoyang Incident Under Legal Investigation by the Law and Liaoning Provinces, Soochow University Announces Temporary Holiday, Explosion in the Professor's Office at Dongda University</h3>

<p>Kaifeng</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 25th] Most students from the six major universities in Henan Province feel that they have been boycotting classes for three weeks, deeply regretting the neglect of their studies. They believe that since representatives have already been sent to Beijing to petition, classes should resume as soon as possible. Therefore, a "anti-boycott" movement is brewing, demanding that professors resume teaching as soon as possible, with the strongest advocacy coming from the Agricultural and Engineering colleges. In addition, the private Zhongyuan Institute of Technology has completed its three-day strike and will resume classes on the 26th.</p>
<p>Shenyang</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] An explosion suddenly occurred in the Economics Professor's office on the fourth floor of Hanqing Building, Northeast University, at 9:25 this morning. The room was empty at the time, and only the furniture suffered minor damage. According to the investigation results, the explosive was confirmed to be a slow-burning bomb. It is noted that the school experienced arson and explosion incidents on the 14th and 19th of this month, but fortunately, there was no damage. The Garrison Headquarters is currently conducting a strict investigation.</p>
<p>Changsha</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changsha, 24th] Hu Shuhua, President of Hunan University, personally participated in the student parade some time ago to maintain order, as attempts to dissuade the students were ineffective. Although no accident occurred, he telegraphed the Ministry of Education, taking the blame and resigning, and requested punishment because the event violated government regulations.</p>
<p>Chongqing</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] The National Women's Normal College in Jiulongpo went on strike today, using the "May 20th Age" blood incident as an excuse. Their slogans are "Against civil war, against hunger." The organizers are still Wang Huanrong and others, who were the main figures in the "anti-violence" movement this spring. After the student movement was launched, Wang and others went to the Shatou District to instigate, but without effect. They then convened a student meeting at the Women's Normal College last night and decided to strike for three days from the 24th to the 26th to promote the movement. At the same time, they resolved to designate "June 2nd" as "Anti-Civil War Day," with a one-day strike. Today, after implementing the strike, Wang and others sent representatives to Chongqing University and other schools to request a response.</p>
<p>Tianjin</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 25th] The Hebei Institute of Technology in Tianjin resumed classes yesterday. Students from Nankai and Beiyang Universities have also scheduled to resume classes tomorrow.</p>

Li Yongqing, Chief Secretary of the Department of Education, responded, promising to submit the students' demands to the Provincial Government and forward them to the Ministry of Education for instructions. The petitioning students considered this response insufficiently concrete and decided to march and continue their strike.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 24th] According to reports: After the administration of Soochow University announced a temporary holiday, many students who could return home left the school one after another, leaving only a few students behind.</p>

<p>Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] Thirty-three principals of public and private secondary schools in Nanjing, including Wang HuiSan, Wang Shumin, Wang Chaobei, Wang Zongmin, and Zhu Shanglin, recently jointly published a statement to the public, stating in brief: A small number of students, using democracy and freedom as their slogans, must understand that democracy and freedom each have their true meaning. Disturbances and chaos are by no means the essence of democracy and freedom. It is imperative to distinguish between right and wrong, stabilize order, and allow students' studies to continue progressing as soon as possible. We, as teachers, bear the responsibility of guiding young people and should do our utmost to strive forward. We dare to ask the public to assist us in guiding young people onto the right track and leading society to stability.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang University Alumni Encourage Students to Resume Classes and Avoid Political Struggles</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 24th] Fifty-seven alumni of Zhejiang University jointly published a letter to their fellow students yesterday, stating in brief: We are deeply concerned about the petitions and strikes of Zhejiang University students in the past few days. We believe that the motives of the majority of students are pure. At the same time, we believe that the government, under the overall difficult situation, should carefully consider the importance of the various demands of the students, weigh the urgency, and gradually resolve them reasonably. Post-war China needs peace and stability and even more so, the ability to endure hardship and be diligent. If actions are too hasty, affecting social order and increasing the difficulties for the government and the school, then it would run counter to the students' original intentions of loving the country and the school. Especially in the early stages of implementing democratic politics, it is necessary to have good manners to serve as a model for people from all walks of life and be praised by social discourse. We cannot bear to see this situation of easily sacrificing coursework and studies continue to develop. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the students will resume classes as soon as possible. As for political issues, we hope that the students will put forward constructive suggestions based on reality and academic perspectives so that Zhejiang University can avoid being used as a venue for political struggles.</p>

Although the two were separated from Beiping, they were not coerced or seduced by the enemy puppets and remained unyielding. This spirit is admirable. The entire atmosphere was solemn and did not end until 1:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong University Student Representatives Went to the Municipal Government Yesterday to Demand the Release of Arrested Students Mayor Wu Promised to Discuss It After Classes Resume</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Five representatives from the Jiaotong University May 20th Tragedy Relief Association, including Qian Shuwen, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 11:00 AM yesterday, verbally requesting the release of arrested students from various schools. Mayor Wu initially stated that he did not recognize the relief association. However, if the schools resume classes on Monday, reasonable demands from the students could be considered, and a satisfactory solution could be reached. He instructed them to submit a list of the arrested students from each school to the government and to discuss it after classes resume tomorrow (Monday). The representatives left around 1:00 PM. The five students and another student visited Mayor Wu again at 6:00 PM in the afternoon, reporting that more than 20 members of the Jiaotong University propaganda team had been arrested in front of the Peace Statue on the Bund and requesting their release. Mayor Wu replied: He has ordered the police department to notify the parents of the middle school students who were arrested yesterday for propaganda activities and have them take them home for supervision before classes resume, so they can attend classes as usual. The arrested university students may also be released if they did not incite strikes, work stoppages, or market closures or violate the emergency measures previously issued by the municipal government. As for the eleven students from the Shanghai Law College who were arrested the day before, they will be handled in a separate case, as they have been handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office, and administrative agencies may not interfere. The visiting students expressed dissatisfaction with Mayor Wu's response and demanded the release of all arrested students, which would guarantee the resumption of classes on Monday. However, Mayor Wu wanted the schools to resume classes first and then discuss the issue of releasing the students. The negotiations had not yielded results by 7:30 PM and were adjourned.</p>

<h3>The Student Movement is Gradually Clearing Up Schools are Resuming Classes in Order</h3>
<p>[Report from Central News Agency] The student movement in this city, after a week of developments, had a symbolic "calm after the storm" yesterday. After the resumption-of-classes movement gained the support of a large number of sensible students, stabilizing forces are actively unfolding. The majority of striking schools began preparations for resuming classes yesterday. In addition, some middle schools and girls' schools that had voluntarily suspended classes in the chaotic situation a few days ago have also decided to resume classes starting today as the student movement gradually clears up. After holding a faculty meeting yesterday, Jiaotong University professors jointly issued a statement, urging students to follow the school's announcement and resume classes starting today. A large number of students from Soochow University and Datong University also returned to school voluntarily yesterday and began reviewing their lessons. The section chiefs of the Shanghai Medical College have scheduled a meeting today to launch a signature campaign to resume classes. As for the middle schools, all will resume classes today. Therefore, it is expected that starting today, except for a small number of schools that may remain stubborn, the rest of the schools are expected to resume classes entirely. However, according to reporters, some students who advocate radical measures still hope to obstruct the resumption-of-classes movement. Yesterday morning, they convened a meeting at Jinan University in the name of the "Nanjing Tragedy Relief Association" and decided to submit four demands to the municipal government: (1) Release the arrested students; (2) Severely punish the perpetrators; (3) Pay for the medical expenses of the injured students; (4) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again.

However, the school notified the students that they must wait for the official notice to attend classes, and the school gates are locked, so the returning students are unable to enter and are currently negotiating with the school. Also: The Datong University student union decided to implement a "flexible strike" starting today. The school's professors held a meeting to discuss the strike, and today nine professor representatives invited representatives from the student self-government association to the Mingfu Library to discuss solutions for resuming classes.</p>

<h3>Table Tennis League The China National Goods Team Defeats the Island Team</h3>
<p>In the four matches of the Second Shanghai Table Tennis League the night before last, the Fourth Division of Dongchang and the Second Division of Yingjian forfeited to the Fourth Textile and the White Team due to rain, which was detrimental to the spirit of sportsmanship. In another match, the Fourth Division of Qingdao National Goods competed against the Postal Service at the Postal Service's sports hall. The strengths of both sides were equal, and the competition was intense. The Qingdao team mistakenly arranged its list, with strong players Wang Xiuguang and Xu Huachang in the rear. Even if they won, it would be useless, as they had already formed a trailing situation. As a result, the China National Goods team relied on the efforts of newcomer Zhang Yuefu in the last group to defeat their opponent Zhu Honggao by three to one, and the entire team defeated the Qingdao team by four to three. Two more matches will continue starting at 8:00 PM tonight.</p>

In addition, the team captains and vice-captains of each group A and B team affiliated with the Shanghai Basketball Committee will also be presented with two pairs per team by the Basketball Committee.</p>
<h3>Considering Shanghai's Sports</h3>
<p>— Wu Bangwei</p>
<p>Shanghai, in the past, was the center of national sports, and in the future, it will still be in a leading position in national sports. Because Shanghai has many rare and excellent conditions, such as the concentration of talent, abundant funds, convenient venues, developed schools, and especially a large number of citizens who truly love sports, the future of Shanghai's sports is infinitely bright. It might not be considered meddling to say a few words for the sake of Shanghai's sports!</p>
<p>Talent is always welcome. Shanghai's sports talent, whether physical education teachers who take sports as a profession or enthusiastic people who promote sports as amateurs, have all made efforts for Shanghai's sports in the past. Many of them are famous throughout the country. Now it seems that some of them are tired. We hope that they can make a comeback, continue to lead everything, strengthen our strength, and jointly develop the cause. New talents are also expected to concentrate in Shanghai, and they must be continuously cultivated from physical education teacher training institutions. Calculated by schools, assuming an average of two people per primary school and an average of three people per secondary school or above, we need at least two thousand specially trained physical education teachers. Calculated by general public sports organizations, we need thousands more sports instructors. This cannot but hope for the efforts of the Municipal College of Physical Education. Although the economic situation cannot be said to be very wealthy, the ticket revenue from various sports competitions is still considerable. If there is a good system and a long-term plan, it will be more than enough to run regular businesses. With this surplus, we can enrich venues and build facilities year by year. Within ten years, we can develop Shanghai's social sports to an ideal state. At the same time, the government should be able to include national sports funding in the budget in accordance with the law and enrich school sports in line with social needs, which will be even more effective.</p>
<p>The physical education venues and equipment seem to be a bit poor at present. In the public sector, the Nanshi Sports Field has a basic scale, but the sports field in the central area of the city has not yet been recovered and has been damaged. Although the gymnasium and swimming pool have played their maximum effect, they are still far from meeting the needs of three or four million citizens. In terms of public organizations, the various activities of the Municipal Sports Association are all held by renting venues, and the number of other sports organizations with sports venues and equipment is also very small. We believe that the Municipal Sports Field should have a plan for construction by year and by district, so that citizens can have suitable places to exercise within five li. The municipal government can promulgate a method to allow public sports organizations to claim public land or rent private land to build sports fields to supplement the lack of public sports fields. Hamburg, Germany, has sixty-one large and small municipal sports fields and fifteen private sports fields. Shanghai has a larger population than Hamburg, so we may as well lower the standards.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where every inch of land is worth its weight in gold. Although school sports are said to be developed, most schools still do not have sports fields. This is a serious problem. We believe that schools with large sports fields should be strictly urged to make full use of them, and they should be encouraged to share them with nearby schools that lack sports fields. Many schools that use lane houses as school buildings must find a way to make it possible for young children to have the opportunity to exercise their bodies. Physical training is impossible to implement effectively after secondary school age. As for the content of teaching materials for school sports, it is also necessary to study and improve them. Fortunately, physical education teachers in middle and primary schools have a fairly sound organization for their own further education and responsibility. The education authorities should find ways to provide assistance and guidance through this organization, provide excellent teaching materials, and discuss implementation methods, so that school sports can enter a normal track.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of Shanghai citizens for sports is really admirable. This phenomenon is unique not only in China, but also rare abroad. However, no one can answer how many sports organizations there are in Shanghai and how many members there are in total, which shows that the strength of the organization is not strong enough. If the sports activities of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of citizens do not have a sound organization and legal management, it is easy to cause malpractices – this malpractice is gradually growing and exposed. The Municipal Sports Association should be the head of all public sports in the city. We cannot but hope that the Sports Association will deal with this relevant issue. The constituent members of the Sports Association should be sports organizations – large ones such as sports associations that include a variety of sports, and small ones such as a simple team – each organization has its fixed members (or team members). The central activity of the Sports Association is to hold various competitions, and its real achievement should be the annual increase in the number of members (organizations and individuals) and the annual expansion of the scope of sports. Shanghai's social sports have already developed very well, so well that there needs to be a sound organization to manage them with common norms.</p>
<p>In short: talent, funding, venues and equipment are the basic conditions for sports. Schools and society are the two sides of sports development, and each is closely related and inseparable. If one part stagnates, the overall situation will be constrained. If the steps are slightly uneven, it will inevitably be chaotic. The one who bears the responsibility of leading the overall situation is the educational administrative organ in charge of sports administration. For the sake of Shanghai's sports, the education authorities must come up with a way and put in effort to guide and supervise this sacred cause. Shanghai was the center of national sports in the past, and it will still be in a leading position in national sports in the future.</p>

<h3>Mayor's Residence Held a Meeting Yesterday Decided to Establish a People's Food Allocation Committee The First Preparatory Exchange of Views Will Be Held Today</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Rice prices have soared recently, and people are panicking. The common people feel unable to make a living. Minister Gu of the Ministry of Food attaches great importance to this and made a special trip to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m., an important meeting was held at Mayor Wu's private residence. Minister Gu, Vice Minister Pang, President Zhang, Mayor Wu, Director Wu, etc. attended, and the meeting did not end until 5 p.m. During the meeting, a detailed review of the people's food problem in this city was conducted. In addition to actively dredging sources and strictly prohibiting hoarding and speculation, it was also decided that the Shanghai Food General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food, the Central Trust Bureau, the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other five institutions should form the Shanghai People's Food Allocation Committee. All matters related to the people's food problem in this city will be handled by the committee in a unified manner. The distribution of rice to schools and factories, which is currently the responsibility of the Social Affairs Bureau, will also be transferred to the committee. The Allocation Committee is expected to be established within this week, and a meeting will be held this morning to exchange views for active preparation.</p>
<p>Today, Distribution of Rice to Factories Begins</p>
<p>[Another report] The distribution of rice to factories in this city has been reviewed and completed in part, and distribution can begin today. As for the distribution of rice to school staff and students, the Education Bureau has not yet submitted the roster to the Social Affairs Bureau. The Social Affairs Bureau will distribute the rice at any time after receiving and approving it. The central government has agreed to allocate 200,000 dan of rice and 500,000 bags of flour per month to schools, factories, and poor households throughout the city, and can increase the allocation at any time as needed.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Expected to Fall</p>
<p>Ji Mingzhai, chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, said yesterday: The fluctuations in the rice market in recent days are mainly due to the impact of wind and rain, which has led to a shortage of goods arriving from various places. Holders are unwilling to sell, and prices are freely quoted. When the weather clears, more goods will gradually arrive from various places. At the same time, the distribution of rice to factories and schools can be implemented within this week, and more than one million people in this city can receive this rice. Moreover, the wheat in the suburbs of this city has been harvested abundantly, so rice prices are expected to fall.</p>
<h3>With the Textile and Construction Industries Purchasing as Much as Possible, There is a Gradual Turnaround in Pudong Cotton Farmers are Encouraged and Hope for a Good Harvest This Year</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to people in the Pudong cotton industry, Pudong counties have always regarded cotton as a major agricultural product. In the prosperous period before the war, the annual output was millions of dan, which was supplied to the Shanghai market as raw materials for the yarn industry. During the period of the occupation, it was subject to enemy and puppet control and was purchased at a reduced price, which was severely damaged. Cotton farmers lost money and were forced to change to planting grain, so many cotton fields were converted into rice fields. However, the soil in Pudong is suitable for cotton cultivation, and planting cotton yields more than planting rice. Therefore, after the victory, most cotton farmers automatically resumed planting cotton and increased cotton production. However, at the beginning of the resumption of production, last year's cheap foreign cotton dumping caused Pudong cotton production to suffer from falling prices again. Cotton farmers asked for sale at cotton prices that did not count the cost, but they still lacked buyers. Fortunately, recently, the China Textile and Construction Corporation has repeatedly sent people to Zhoupu and other places to purchase as much as possible, so the cotton price has slightly kept up with the local product comparison price. After this encouragement, cotton farmers are more enthusiastic about sowing than in previous years. New cotton is widely planted in various regions, so it is estimated that this year's output is expected to be a good harvest. It is reported that the Textile and Construction Corporation strictly identifies the grade and evaluates the price of purchased goods, and eliminates the bad habits of adulteration in the past. Cotton farmers and cotton merchants are also happy to accept this, and have automatically hired workers to select and improve the accumulated ills in order to restore the cotton production in Pudong.</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau Plans Passenger Insurance</h3>
<p>The Minimum Amount is 20 Million</p>
<p>In addition to actively promoting life insurance and property insurance, the Insurance Department of the Central Trust Bureau has recently been preparing to establish passenger insurance. Passengers traveling by airplanes, ships, trains, long-distance buses, and other means of transportation can request insurance from the bureau to avoid accidental risks. The minimum insurance amount is 20 million yuan in national currency, and the premium is 20,000 yuan. Once a passenger is insured, if they encounter dangers or casualties during the journey, their family members can receive compensation from the bureau. The bureau believes that the scope of this type of insurance is very wide, covering the whole country, and cannot be handled by insurance companies with weak capital. Therefore, it plans to jointly organize a large group with insurance companies from all over the country to operate. If there is any surplus insurance amount, it can also adopt a reciprocal method to share it with the United Kingdom, the United States, Switzerland, and other countries. However, this type of "passenger insurance" is absolutely different in nature from "property insurance," so it must be handled separately from property insurance.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Salt Affairs Glimpses Production, Transportation, Sales, Seizure, and Hoarding</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yang Longhu, director of the Shanghai Salt Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, recently met with a reporter from this newspaper and gave a brief account of the office's business situation as follows. He said: The office's regular business is nothing more than production, transportation, sales, and seizure, with the additional business of hoarding.</p>
<p>In terms of salt production, the main one is the salt produced in Yuanpu Chang. The Chang is formed by the merger of three salt Changs. It produces four to five thousand dan in the off-season and eighty to ninety thousand zu in the peak season. Currently, because the quality of the salt produced in the Chang is not good, the cost is high, the output is small, and the brine is weak, production has been restricted.</p>
<p>In terms of salt transportation, it is divided into two types: one is commercial transportation and commercial sales, and the other is official transportation and commercial sales. In the total amount of 100,000 dan of salt transported on average each month in this area, Yuanpu Chang accounts for 20,000 dan, the North China Salt Industry Company accounts for 20,000 dan, and the remaining 60,000 zu are transported from Yuyao, Zhejiang, and other places. Commercial transportation accounts for 80% of the total amount of 100,000 zu.</p>
<p>In terms of salt sales, a purely free trade system is adopted. Therefore, the price of edible salt transported and sold by salt merchants is not controlled. However, the salt transported by the government has an official warehouse price, which is currently 60,000 yuan per zu including tax. The current price of commercially transported salt is about 75,000 yuan per dan. The total amount of salt sold from July to December last year reached 880,000 dan. The total amount from January to April this year reached 514,000 dan. The average monthly sales of salt has exceeded the quota of 100,000 dan.</p>
<p>In terms of salt seizure, the fact that the average monthly sales amount exceeds the quota is sufficient to prove that although smuggled salt still exists, the amount is not much. Statistics from July to December last year show that a total of 9,200 dan of smuggled salt were seized. From January to April this year, a total of 2,800 dan of smuggled salt were seized.</p>
<p>The additional business of salt hoarding is the "Changping Salt" transported by the government, which is hoarded in official warehouses. When the market price of salt fluctuates and supply and demand are unbalanced, it is sold at a fair price to regulate surpluses and deficits. For example, last year, because salt production in Zhejiang was not abundant, "Changping Salt" was purchased from Taiwan, Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places to make up for the shortage. In addition, the office also handles salt loan affairs for salt merchants who transport salt through this area to the areas along the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market situation was still strong. The initial price of Great Britain cigarettes was 7.3 million yuan, and there were occasional transactions. Then, it rose slightly, and there were quite a few resales in the middle, and the quoted price returned to the market. The closing price at noon was 7.3 million yuan, up 30,000 yuan. The market conditions for other Chinese-branded cigarettes were also quite strong. Later, it was heard that a lot of return goods of Old Knife brand cigarettes came from Hankou, and there was already secret dumping in the market, so it was difficult to expect the cigarette market to improve for a while.</p>
<h3>Soap and Candle Raw Materials Sell Well</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of soap and candle raw materials rose due to purchases from various parties. Monthly brand caustic soda stepped firmly to 7.3 million yuan, and American goods also followed up to 7.1 million yuan, both up 150,000 yuan from the previous day. N rosin rose by 20,000 yuan, and the price per can was 600,000 yuan. White wax also rose by 100,000 yuan, and the price per Sima dan was 1.3 million yuan. Styrene rose by 200,000 yuan, and the price per market dan was 3.2 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Domestic Prices Continue to Fall Difficulties in Tung Oil and Bristles Exports The Expansion of the Black Market Exchange Rate Difference Promotes Tung Oil Smuggling</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to people in the export industry: At present, the export of tung oil and bristles has obviously fallen into a slump. And domestic prices continue to fall. In terms of the tung oil market price in this city, each zu (110 pounds) is equivalent to 500,000 yuan in national currency. However, the US market price recently reported 25 cents per pound, which is equivalent to only 330,000 yuan per dan at the local market price. It can be seen that the price difference is too large, and merchants are really unable to promote foreign sales. Even the foreign sales business of tung oil from China Vegetable Oil Factory has been suspended for as long as two months. In terms of bristles, the market price in Shanghai is equivalent to 4 million yuan in national currency per old dan (equivalent to 133.33 pounds), while the foreign market price is only equivalent to 3 million yuan in national currency per old dan. The price difference is also large.</p>
<p>He further pointed out: Recently, the difference between the black market foreign exchange and the official price foreign exchange has been increasing, which invisibly makes the difference between the domestic and foreign market prices of the export materials increase. And it also creates tung oil smuggling as the only profitable way. It is said that most of the smuggled tung oil comes from Hongjiang, Chenzhou, and other places in western Hunan. The output of this area is quite abundant, and most of the products take an early route bypassing Guilin, and then transported to Guangzhou via the Xijiang River, and then smuggled to Hong Kong. It is said that the cost when arriving in Guangzhou is more than 400,000 yuan per dan. Although it is still traded at a price of 25 cents per pound in Hong Kong, due to the black market foreign exchange settlement, each dan can still make a profit. It is estimated that the smuggled tung oil to Hong Kong is at least more than 1,000 tons per month.</p>
<h3>The Exchange Rate of the Taiwan Dollar Will be Adjusted at Any Time in the Future</h3>
<p>The Taiwan Provincial Government will make reasonable adjustments to the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar at any time in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, since the Taipei Post Office opened foreign exchange remittances outside the province, it stipulated that the remittance limit per person was 1 million Taiwan dollars. It is said that this restriction has now been lifted. There is no limit to the total amount of remittances per day, but the maximum amount per ticket cannot exceed 1 million Taiwan dollars. The remittance fee is 5%, and telegraphic transfers are subject to additional telegram fees of about 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>On the Rationing System</h3>
<p>— Hong Zhangli</p>
<p>The root cause of the current price problem is complex, but the imperfection of material control is also an important reason. As the saying goes, "It is not scarcity that is to be feared, but uneven distribution." People in both the government and the public have learned from the lessons of prices and realized that strengthening control is urgently needed at present. The rationing system is a very important part of the entire control, and a thorough implementation is naturally a good way to curb prices.</p>
<p>In order for the rationing system to produce the expected effect, it must have the following conditions. First, in order to control consumption, the set quantity must be lower than the usual demand, but it must be close to the actual demand. Second, it must not only be quantitative, but also periodic. Third, it must not only be periodic, but also of uniform quality; otherwise, if the rationing is small in quantity, poor in quality, and often delayed, the people will not be able to survive, and the black market will not be eliminated. Secondly, the rationed materials must have an official price to replace the competitive price under the free economy, and to require the official price to be reasonable, the pricing standard must be close to the production cost, plus a reasonable profit; it should be quite stable, and cannot be changed in the morning and evening. Otherwise, the official price will become a mere formality, and the mission of control will be difficult to complete.</p>
<p>According to the rationing methods, advanced countries have four well-established methods: (1) the prohibition system, which prohibits the free manufacture or consumption of goods; (2) the restriction system, which restricts the quantity of consumption; (3) the license system, which requires prior permission from the governing office; (4) the coupon book distribution system, which is the quantitative distribution system. In terms of its effectiveness, first, the implementation of the family rationing system can remedy the materials in which the demand exceeds the supply. Because the implementation of this system naturally restricts consumption, and can concentrate resources in the production sector, in order to increase production. Second, it can avoid the drawbacks of material bias and profit monopoly. Because all economic functions such as production and transportation are subject to national supervision or operation, it is naturally difficult for merchants to hoard and monopolize and obtain huge profits. Third, it can eliminate speculation. Because if the rationing system can be fully implemented for daily necessities, the main target of obtaining huge profits disappears, and speculators will naturally find it difficult to apply their skills. Fourth, it can stabilize people's lives. Fifth, it can eliminate economic competition. Since prices are set and material supply and demand are restricted, the economic losses caused by competition can naturally be avoided. However, the listed advantages are assumed to be a perfect implementation of this system. In our country, there are no accurate survey statistics of population and products, which can be used as a basis for production and consumption, which are all in vague impressions. The rich and powerful arbitrarily enjoy, and most poor people starve and have no food, which is a well-known fact. Because the rationing of daily necessities is limited to a part and the amount of rationing is small, most of the general people's needs are obtained from the black market, and the advantages of rationing cannot be brought into play.</p>
<p>In view of the current situation, to seek a way to correct it, in addition to implementing the above-mentioned conditions that must be met, there must also be a comprehensive plan and thorough methods. It is necessary to achieve consistency from top to bottom, and the rich and powerful cannot buy more, and the poor and powerless can still get it. And start from adjusting the rationing mechanism, strengthening personnel management, and promoting the rationing coupon system. Everything is based on the principle of fairness and reason. In this way, although the income is small, it is equal, and although it is poor, it is safe. Not only is price stability hopeful, but also the current turbulent situation will also calm down.</p>
<h3>Coal Production and Consumption District Coordination with the Current Situation</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Relevant parties are considering taking necessary measures to prepare for the event that the supply of coal from North China is cut off, so that Central China can be self-sufficient. The current coordination between production areas and consumption areas is as follows: Coal mines in Qinhuangdao and Northeast China supply various parts of North China outside of Tianjin and Beijing. Coal from Keelung supplies Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou. A portion of the coal from Qinhuangdao and Keelung is transshipped through Qingdao to supply power plants and other public utilities in the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area.</p>
<p>The main difficulty in the north is the busy military transport and the lack of wagons. At the same time, the Communist army often cuts off the traffic lines between the coal mines and the ports, so the southward transport of coal often fails to reach the expected amount. However, there are two good phenomena: one is that the Keelung coal mine has gradually recovered after the 228 Incident; the other is that the output of the Huainan coal mine has increased sharply after development. If it can be increased to more than 100,000 tons per month, the Central China region can be self-sufficient and does not have to rely on the north.</p>
<h3>Soybean Exports Temporarily Suspended Except for Italy</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau is contacting various countries in need of soybean exports. Of the 13,200 tons needed by Italy, half were shipped out earlier this month, and the remaining 6,600 tons are limited to be shipped out by the end of this month. The needs of other countries such as Switzerland and the Czech Republic are suspended until the measures for oils and raw materials are announced.</p>
<h3>Northeast Soybeans Arrive in Shanghai Will be Distributed to Various Oil Mills</h3>
<p>In order to suppress the current rising trend of edible oil, the municipal government is trying to dredge oil sources and has reached an agreement with the China Grain Company. When the company purchases soybeans from the Northeast and transports them to Shanghai, a part of them needs to be supplied to this city. The company currently has 750 tons of soybeans, which have arrived here a few days ago and will be reasonably distributed to various oil mills by the municipal government.</p>
<h3>The Industry and Commerce Counseling Office Continues to Discuss the Issue of Japanese Compensation Factories</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Industry and Commerce Counseling Office held a meeting the day before yesterday, attended by representatives of private factories, to continue discussing the matter of undertaking Japanese compensation factories. The eight preparatory representatives of the National Federation of Industry and Commerce have all been elected the day before yesterday. According to Mr. Tian Hexiang, the representative of the Shanghai General Association of Industry and Commerce can be produced within next week, but the list of representatives of the local branches will still take time to produce. The Ministry of Economic Affairs originally hoped that the joint factory organization work could be completed within this month, but judging from the current situation, it will inevitably be postponed. The funds required to undertake the project were estimated two months ago to be 100 billion yuan in national currency per factory, totaling 400 billion yuan for the four factories; today, with the soaring prices of everything, it has already exceeded this number. The representatives of the private factories now insist that before building the factory, they must send representatives to Japan to inspect the compensation machines planned to be moved back to determine their value and performance.</p>
<h3>The United States Notifies that a Machine Tool Exhibition Will Be Held Regularly</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The US Consulate General in Shanghai recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that the US Machine Tool Manufacturers Association will hold an unprecedented machine tool exhibition in Chicago from September 17 to 26 this year. All the progress of American industry during the war will be fully demonstrated. The location of the exhibition is Dodge Chicago, which covers an area of 44,000 square meters. This factory was established during the war and specializes in manufacturing aircraft engines. It is one of the largest aircraft factories in the United States. More than 250 types of machines are planned to be exhibited, and each type is further divided into several types, with special machines for large-scale production as the main body. After the opening of the exhibition, it is hoped that representatives from all walks of life in our country will visit.</p>
<h3>Business Conditions in Various Places</h3>
<p>Hankou White sugar trading is balanced and prices tend to be stable. Yesterday, the market price of Five Sheep white sugar was 187,000 yuan per dan. The price of tung oil rose again, to 400,000 yuan per market dan. Mianyang fine velvet cotton was 840,000 yuan per dan, and Tianmen fine velvet cotton was 780,000 yuan per dan. Monthly brand caustic soda was out of stock, Sichuan wax was 6 million yuan per dan, and Du 490,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Chongqing Shanghai Inner Exchange is balanced, and prices have been overcorrected. Camel cigarettes fell in price, and Jierxi was also out of stock and had no price. Rough Maogou velvet was 730,000 yuan per zu, 20-count Jingzhou yarn opened at 6.3 million, and there were no transactions for Meiting Shilin.</p>
<p>Tianjin Industrial raw materials are becoming increasingly scarce, the source of new goods is scarce, and market prices are soaring. The price per barrel is 13 million yuan, and the price per legal currency is 1,062 yuan. 32-count Feima was 8.35 million, and 20-count Sanding was 7.65 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Xu-Yan Section: From Being Riddled with Holes and Full of Twists and Turns to Embracing New Life</h3>
<p>— Yanzhou, 14th Instant Telegram — Special Correspondent Ling Songshou</p>
<p>In the face of the widespread fighting in central Shandong, the opening of the Xu-Yan section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is a matter of national concern from any perspective. The main task of this reporter's northern trip was to see the general progress of the repair work on this section of the railway.</p>
<p>Speaking of the repair of this section, we must first understand the means the Communist army used against this section of the railway in the past. After the victory, the first shot fired by the Communist army was to destroy the railway.</p>
<p>Repair Work Repeatedly Unfolded Three Times</p>
<p>In a time of financial hardship, the government never forgot the work of restoration. With a heavy heart, in November of the 34th year [1945], it began repairing the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, starting from Liguo Station and working north. By December, it had reached Hanzhuang Station. At this time, the Communist army panicked, believing that the repair of the railway was more dangerous to them than having a gun pointed at their chest. In less than three days, they destroyed it again. After negotiations by the Americans, the Communist army admitted their mistake, and the repair team began a second repair effort from Liguo Station. By January of the 35th year [1946], just a few days before the Nationalists and Communists agreed to establish a government and the Nationalist government issued a ceasefire order, the railway had been repaired to Lincheng. However, the Communist army stubbornly refused to allow the tracks to be joined, and after failed negotiations, the railway bureau staff returned to Xuzhou to await orders. The ceasefire order did not stop the Communist army's military ambitions. A written document instead fueled the flames of war in various areas, and the Xuzhou-Lincheng railway, which had just been repaired for a few months, was subjected to a third destruction by the Communist army in May.</p>
<p>The government exercised restraint for the sake of the country and sought a peaceful resolution, negotiating with the Communist side. On July 20, the railway bureau began a third repair effort. This time, it took five months to repair to Lincheng, and the 31-kilometer-long Lin-Zao branch line was also repaired and opened to traffic. For about a month, train after train transported several tons of black coal. The good times did not last long. Just as the residents along the railway were beginning to feel a bit of vitality, in January of this year, the Communist army again captured Zaozhuang with a strong force. Although the Lin-Xu line was spared a fourth destruction thanks to the 97th Army's defense of Lincheng, the Lin-Zao branch line was left with only broken and missing roadbeds, and it remains shattered to this day.</p>
<p>Repair Difficulties: Like Laying a New Road</p>
<p>The traitor's atrocities forced the government to use force as a backup for peaceful unification. In recent months, the situation in Shandong Province has gradually become clearer, and the opening of the Xuzhou-Jinan line has made the opening of the Xuzhou-Yan section a major issue for the transportation authorities.</p>
<p>The reporter met with Zhu Xianbin (Chief of the Engineering Department of the Railway Bureau), who is in charge of the repair work, in Xuzhou. In Tengxian, I also met Lu Songkang (Engineer of the Railway Bureau), who is also a team leader. Despite their busy work, both of them told the reporter everything about the repairs.</p>
<p>Because the damage was so severe, they both agreed that the repair work was tantamount to laying a new road. This section of the road (referring to Lincheng to Yanzhou), excluding the stations, is 96 kilometers long and has 61 railway bridges, totaling 143 spans, with the longest bridge being 260 meters long.</p>
<p>When work began, there was no certainty about the availability of civilian workers along the way, so in addition to the 490 veteran workers, 5,000 people were first hired in Xuzhou. Later, when they arrived in Tengxian, the Tengxian County Government allocated 2,000 people, and the Zou County Government also recruited more than 3,000 people to join the work. At the busiest time, there were more than 12,000 people working every day. Now, the number is gradually being reduced. In addition to the veteran workers, there are still more than 1,000 basic workers and more than 1,000 temporary workers.</p>
<p>Equipment Needed: Jointly Planned by the Ministry and the Railway Bureau</p>
<p>In terms of equipment, preparations began after the takeover and reached more than 80% of the required amount. The equipment that has arrived in Yanzhou is no longer a problem. According to statistics, the total equipment needed is: (1) Rails: 19,076; (2) Fishplates: 38,152; (3) Fishplate Bolts: 76,304; (4) Sleepers: 174,312 (including 31,242 for bridges); (5) Spikes: 572,280; (6) Switches: 31 sets.</p>
<p>Rails and sleepers are allocated by the Ministry of Transportation, and the rest are arranged by the Railway Bureau. The fishplates (i.e., joint bars) are more difficult because the rails issued by the Ministry are not of consistent sizes and styles. The fishplates must be matched to the size of the rails, so a portion of the rails is received and a portion of the fishplates is manufactured. One-fifth of the rails were collected by offering a price because after the Communist army's destruction, most of them were hidden in areas within 20 kilometers. Offering a small price like this caused the people to bring them when they saw them, which could be considered a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Must Return to the Station to Rest Before Dark</p>
<p>The first difficulty currently felt in the work is the instability of public security. Therefore, the workers must return to the large station to rest before dark. They depart at 5:00 in the morning, and the round trip takes 8 hours (the speed of the train cannot exceed 10 kilometers per hour on the newly repaired railway), so the actual working time is only 7-8 hours. The second is that the railway has just been repaired and there are very few tracks, but there is a lot of military transport, which sometimes hinders the movement of materials. Other headaches in the repair work include the urgency of time and the variety and age of the equipment. However, all the workers, in such an environment, braving wind, sand, and scorching sun, ultimately demonstrated the following achievements: (1) They transported 500,000 cubic meters of soil and laid the roadbed long ago; (2) The efficiency of daily work reached a maximum of 2.55 kilometers; (3) So far, only a gap of more than ten kilometers from Zou County to Yanzhou South remains, and it can be opened to traffic before the military's deadline of the 20th of this month, which was brought forward by ten days.</p>
<p>The military brought forward the deadline by ten days, but also took into account the difficulties of the Railway Bureau, and separately transferred a part of the × Battalion and × Battalion of the × Regiment of the Railway Engineering Corps to depart from Yanzhou and repair southward. It also transferred the × Battalion and × Battalion of the same regiment to be responsible for guarding the Railway Bureau's repair team, so that they could work with peace of mind, extend working hours, and increase work efficiency. On the 12th, the reporter accompanied Lieutenant General Chen Shaoping, Commander-in-Chief of the 5th District Railway Military Transportation Command, on a special train of the Railway Bureau to inspect the work sites of the above two units. Those traveling with him included Railway Bureau Team Leader Zhu Xianbin, Deputy Team Leader Lu Songkang, Engineer Shi Zhuodai, and others, totaling thirteen people. They first arrived at Liangxiadian. After getting off the train, the first thing that caught the eye was two large material trains of the Railway Bureau, fully loaded with sleepers and rails. Further ahead was a pile of workers pushing, knocking, hammering, hitting, measuring, and shouting... The reporter was attracted by this painting written with "strength." I immediately ran over, stepping step by step on the newly laid sleepers, feeling a lot of energy.</p>
<p>Repair Steps: Starting from Preliminary Work</p>
<p>Regarding the repair work steps: The first step is to lay the sleepers on the built roadbed. The sleepers are loaded onto trucks from the material train, transported to the work site, and then laid manually, with a distance of about 75 centimeters between each sleeper. The next step is for the engineering car loaded with rails to be pushed to the rail-laying section with the effort of several people. With one person emitting a singing sound of "Hmm... Ya... Ha...", many skilled workers quickly pulled a 480-pound rail from the car to the front. When it was about to leave the car and fall to the ground, another person specialized in tapping the end of the rail with an iron bar. This was the most tense and interesting part. More than a dozen people let go at the same time, and the rail fell onto the sleeper, precisely connecting with the rail behind it. When you hear their singing at its most vigorous, that means they have laid another rail in a short time of only two or three minutes. After laying two rails, the engineering car immediately rolled onto the newly laid rails and continued their work, while the workers nailing the tracks behind caught up. Before nailing the tracks, they first had to measure whether the two tracks were parallel. After standardization, they nailed part of the spikes, then attached the fishplates, and then added the spikes. After that came the maintenance work of correcting, leveling, and filling with stones.</p>
<p>Once the Train Passes, I'll Also Have a Way</p>
<p>The reporter found a hired worker and asked him, "Is it hard?" He said, "Don't ask me, old man. Even if the government doesn't give me money, I still have to do it! Once the train passes, I'll also have a way!" Then he told the reporter how the Communist army had gathered thousands of people two years ago, and with a single order, they all started to throw sections of rails into the river and burn the sleepers one by one... Watching him do it. "But today, it's still been repaired in our hands!" This was his last and highest sentence.</p>
<p>Our group continued north, passing several railway bridges. Although there were sleepers on the bridge, there was a deep abyss below, and the reporter was too cowardly to move forward. Later, three battalion commanders wearing glasses... Zhao, Qiu, and Yu... took turns helping the reporter across. Then we got into the car, went to Zou County for lunch, and after lunch, we arrived at the Railway Engineering Corps' repair work site: Yangjiaxiang.</p>
<p>The Communist Army Demolished the Road, Never Thinking of Coming Back</p>
<p>This place is 7 kilometers from Yanzhou. Because Yanzhou held firm and did not fall, the extent of the damage was not very severe on the surface. The general situation is like this: within 3 kilometers south of Yanzhou, the tracks are intact; in the area from 3 kilometers to 11 kilometers, the rails were dug up but not moved away, the sleepers were all missing, and the roadbed was not completely damaged. However, the Communist army's demolition work has always been well-researched. Although the destruction of this section of the road was not thorough due to environmental limitations, they did not relax in the past. They dug an inclined surface intermittently on both sides of the roadbed. In this way, even if it is repaired, problems will often occur due to the uneven compactness of the roadbed soil. You know, he destroyed the threads of the screws on the fishplates at the joints or blew up the nails at both ends of the rails. According to the usual method, you must use a lot of force to squeeze out the threads from the nail head to the nail body, or even cut off the nail body to remove it for use. According to the second method, although the rails are there, they are equivalent to waste. Doing this is almost the same as thorough destruction. Commander Chen smiled and said, "We also demolished the railway during the War of Resistance, but we never destroyed it as thoroughly as they did!" The reporter interjected: "We wanted to come back and use it again when we demolished it back then, but they demolished the road and never thought of coming back!"</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Ni Zhongli is also the captain of the regiment's repair team, and he is in charge of the repair work here. The reporter had a good chat with him. He told the reporter about the many difficulties in working here. Although the destruction here is light, the degree of trouble in repairing it is almost the same as in the leveled places. First, the rails must be removed. Removing one rail takes at least half an hour. Then, the remaining gravel on the roadbed must be cleared away before the sleepers can be laid, the tracks can be laid... and so on. In addition, there are many inconveniences in the transportation of materials. The sleepers used here are received and transported from the Railway Bureau's repair team in Liangxiadian. Of the eleven trucks, only five are in good working order. On average, each truck can transport 100 sleepers per day. In addition, there are 200 oxcarts, which come back every three days, and each cart can load 10 sleepers. All in all, a maximum of more than 1,000 Shenmu sleepers are transported per day. However, according to the planned plan, 1.5 kilometers must be repaired and 150 rails laid here every day. Each rail is matched with 14 sleepers, requiring a total of 2,100 sleepers. In addition, there are four bridges that need 8,000 sleepers to make the bridge foundations. Although there are so many difficulties, Battalion Commander Ni is still very optimistic. He is thinking of other ways to strengthen transportation work, so as to achieve the expected goal and complete the repair and open the railway to traffic before the 20th.</p>
<p>This repair unit has worked on the Lin-Zao branch line in the past, and later repaired to Xin'anzhen on the Longhai Line. This time, it was transferred here to work. According to Battalion Commander Ni, it may be transferred to the Longhai Line for repairs again in the near future. The reporter has agreed that if work starts, please notify me to visit.</p>
<p>The weather was very hot, and sweat poured out like pulp. The reporter picked up the big gourd in the bucket, scooped up water, and drank it several times. At this time, those who came with me, except Battalion Commander Ni, had all returned to Liangxiadian. Because the reporter was going to Yanzhou, he walked north with Battalion Commander Ni, walking on the undamaged tracks. He even found that green grass was growing, which was enough to imagine the long-term neglect over the past two years. The railway had also tasted the loneliness! The setting sun was in the mountains, and the crows returned in droves. Although it brought a desolate atmosphere, the voices of people, the sound of iron, the sound of cars, the noise... all merged into one, injecting blood into this road and violently breaking through this long-term loneliness.</p>

<p>— Changchun, 15th Instant Airmail — Our Reporter Zhao Zhan</p>
<p>During a time when rice was as expensive as pearls and firewood as cinnamon in the Northeast, many young students from the Communist-controlled areas north of the Songhua River successively escaped from the cracks of war. After they escaped, they received a relief fund of 2,000 yuan per person from the Jilin Provincial Government, but after that, no one cared about them. The national universities in Shenyang refused to admit them, and the Youth Education and Employment Assistance Committee had no way to help. They became refugees, sometimes going to the Northeast Branch of the Executive Yuan to ask for assistance, but now the gate of the Executive Yuan has also been closed. They have felt that there is no way to appeal and the road ahead is bleak, so they have wandered to Changchun to try their luck.</p>
<p>One House, Two Meals of Porridge</p>
<p>The Youth League lent them a house and provided them with two meals of sorghum porridge every day, relying on the City Government to mobilize donations from all sectors of society. Although this is a pitiful opportunity to survive, after they have experienced the most tragic wandering life, they feel that surviving is also a way out. So far, the number of refugee university students concentrated in Changchun has reached 880, including 97 female students. They are all students from colleges and universities above the specialty level during the puppet Manchukuo era. They come from seventy-one different schools. Some studied in Japan, such as students from Waseda University, Tokyo Hosei University, Tokyo Meiji University, Tokyo Nihon University, Niigata Medical University, Sendai Higher Industrial School, and Hiroshima Women's College, which was destroyed by the atomic bomb, totaling thirty-two units. In terms of school units, schools in Japan account for one-half. However, the number of people studying at puppet Manchukuo schools accounts for two-thirds, including Fengtian Institute of Technology, Xinjing Hosei University, Lushun Institute of Technology, Dalian Institute of Economics, Harbin Agricultural University, Jiamusi Medical University, and Jilin Normal University, totaling thirty-seven schools. Among the 880 people, a few students are not students who escaped from the north of the Songhua River, and there are also eight students from the puppet Peking University and two students from the puppet North China College of Law and Politics. The number of refugees is not fixed, and refugee students continue to report. They have established a United Association of Refugee and Out-of-School University Students to unite and concentrate their efforts to seek survival together.</p>
<p>Ten Grains of Rice, One Drop of Blood</p>
<p>They come from the war zone and have been tested by a difficult life. It can be said that they live in a pitiful state of hunger and cold. Four hundred and twenty-five people live in a three-story building, living a painful and serious life. At night, they roll on the ground with their clothes on, and very few have a blanket or quilt, and the female students are the same. No one complains about not getting a warm dream. They get up at 6:00 in the morning, raise the flag, and then run to the park. They eat two meals of porridge a day, and they don't even have boiled water to drink. They drink cold water and also drink the germs of disease. Some students have fallen ill under these living conditions. They warn themselves with the painful experience of life. When there is only porridge to eat, they write the warning phrase "When you have rice to eat, don't forget when there is no rice" on the wall of the restaurant. "Ten grains of rice, one drop of blood," what an accurate calculation this is!</p>
<p>Some students have temporarily found jobs to make a living, such as elementary school teachers, civil servants, and newspaper publishers. They can only find jobs that sell their labor cheaply. They use the rewards they receive as public funds for the pseudo-refugee and out-of-school university student federation.</p>
<p>Thinking of School, Thinking of Books</p>
<p>The students' only requirement is to enter school and have books to read. This is indeed a very legitimate requirement. The education authorities have not been able to come up with a suitable solution. A commissioner of the Youth Education and Employment Assistance Committee took away their roster, but there has been no news since then. They are unwilling to wait and waste their studies, so they have decided to set up a tutoring class themselves, which will be planned by the federation formed by the students and will be realized in the near future. The tutoring period is four months, and the required funding is estimated to be about 200 million circulation coupons. Where does this huge amount of funding come from? They have decided to use the method of fundraising, asking all sectors of Changchun City to show great sympathy to help them. It is difficult to say what the effect will be, but their appeal can indeed get deep sympathy. They said, "We will invite teachers ourselves, find houses ourselves, and the students will attend classes on the floor. We are determined to do it." They asked for support from the press. In their deep and melancholy eyes, they contained tears and sincerely expressed their eager aspirations, hoping to grab the reporter to cross the river, just like grabbing a straw. In sympathy and shame, I told the reorganized new government that not giving them food to eat and not giving them books to read is a shame for the government, and the government should be responsible.</p>

<h3>Hoping for Jiao Tong University to Set Up Branch Test Centers</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Summer vacation is coming, and which of us high school graduates is not hoping to enter an ideal university with a passionate heart to seek further study? But in fact, we have many difficulties.</p>
<p>Jiao Tong University in Shanghai is one of the most famous science and engineering universities in our country, and it is also our ideal university. We all hope to be able to participate in the entrance examination. However, it is said that Shanghai Jiao Tong University will still follow the past practice and only have one test center in Shanghai for this summer's admissions. However, traveling from the north to Shanghai is indeed not easy given the current traffic conditions. Raising this travel expense is simply impossible for us poor students.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Pingjin area has always been known as a "cultural city," and the number of middle schools is indeed quite large. In addition, there are probably several times more middle schools in Hebei and the Northeast than in Shanghai. Therefore, in theory, Jiao Tong University should set up a test center in Peiping (or Tianjin) so that the tens of thousands of high school graduates in North China can all have the opportunity to take the "Jiao Tong University" entrance examination, because the establishment of universities by the country is for the sake of young people throughout the country, not just for a certain region or other wealthy classes. Tsinghua, Peking University, and Nankai, which are famous in the country for their liberal arts, literature, law, and business, are preparing to set up nine test centers this year, which is for this reason. Therefore, we sincerely hope that Jiao Tong University can change its past practice and set up a test center in Peiping (or Tianjin), which will greatly benefit our large group of students!

<h3>Rent Paid in Rice is Unbearable</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I originally lived on Chongqing South Road. In May of last year, I was forced to move by a second landlord using his power. In a hurry to find a house, I rented a flat in the Longhua District, with the rent calculated as one dan of rice per month (rice was more than 50,000 yuan last May). At that time, I did not sign a lease contract or have any housing tickets. Later, the landlord asked for rice every month, so I bought rice and paid it. Sometimes, he asked for cash, which was converted according to the market price of rice. There was no problem last year when the price of rice was stable, but this year it has fluctuated severely and has now skyrocketed to the 300,000 yuan mark. I am a factory worker with limited income, and under these circumstances, I have the pain of unbearable burden. Therefore, I especially send a letter, begging to borrow a corner of your newspaper to expose it and urge the Longhua District Office to uphold justice and instruct on how to resolve the following points: (1) In the Longhua District, rent is often calculated in rice, which seems unreasonable. However, canceling and changing to calculate rent is impossible because the accumulation of problems is too great. Can the District Office set a rice price for rent, taking care of the tenants as a principle, which is cheaper than the official price and announced for implementation? (2) If the landlord does not agree to the rice price for rent, then the calculation should be based on the official rice price (i.e., household rice) announced by the authorities. (3) It is absolutely not allowed to convert the rent at the black market price of rice, so that the tenants have room to breathe. After the above points are discussed and decided, they should be announced and implemented. (A citizen of Longhua District)</p>
<h3>Don't Forget to Bring Your ID Card When Traveling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I had something to do and went to Luodian via Dachang. As soon as I had arrived, military police boarded the bus to inspect the car and check each person's ID card. I forgot to bring my ID card. Fortunately, the military police forgave me and only told me to pay attention next time. It was the same when I stayed at a hotel in Suzhou last time. I am especially informing all readers not to forget to bring their national ID cards when traveling to other cities or suburbs, so as to save trouble. (Cai Miaosheng)</p>

<h3>Early Summer in West Lake</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Hangzhou, 20th Instant Dispatch</p>
<p>Spring has waned, and willow catkins drift from the willows surrounding West Lake, settling on every yacht. The flowers of the tung trees flutter and whirl, dyeing the Lakeside Park a snowy white. This year's spring rains seem scarce, and in the blink of an eye, the weather has unleashed heatwaves. The sun is no longer beloved, and the trees on Su Causeway and Bai Causeway grow a deeper green. During the day, the vast lake surface glitters with patches of golden scales. In the evening, people stroll leisurely along the lakeside, reluctant to leave even late at night. This is already early summer weather, ripened to an unbearable degree. Checking the thermometer, it has reached the 90-degree mark. Perhaps this year's summer will be a bitterly hot season.</p>
<p>Ceaseless Waves Should Transform into the Main Force of Construction</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of spring rains, the wheat harvest in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area is quite good, but the soybean harvest is poor, as is the early rice. Silkworms, due to the allocation of Yunnan breeds and insufficient temperature, mostly died. Urgent attempts to remedy the situation will probably not yield ideal results. As this hot summer approaches, let us think about the kind-hearted farmers who, braving the intense heat, working tirelessly despite the turbulent national situation, remain loyal to their duties. In this peaceful scenic city, many others have stirred up waves. Following the rice craze, there have been student movements at Yīng Dà, Zhè Dà, and Zhī Dà, as well as some sporadic labor strikes. These numerous phenomena symbolize the storms of the era and the yearning for progressive construction. As John Leighton Stuart said, "China has been destroying itself year after year for decades. Now, what we need is a revolution of construction." The prerequisite for construction is stability, and the prerequisite for stability is to seek ways to solve problems.</p>
<p>Summer has arrived. Let us hope that these many waves will transform into the main force of construction. Look at those millions of farmers; they are still diligently and conventionally toiling. They need new waves to irrigate, they need new construction. We can no longer allow the city to be disconnected from the countryside, nor can we allow a deep chasm to exist between them.</p>
<p>West Lake in Summer Begins to Stir in the Dusk</p>
<p>Although the weather is gradually getting hotter, Paradise also senses a phenomenon of unease. However, many people still come to Hangzhou to play, and the hotels still hang "Full" signs. Only the sampan business is much quieter during the day, but in the evening, business is more lively. The Lakeside Tea House in Sixth Park and the Tea House at Peaceful Lake in Autumn Moon are so crowded. Tea at the tea house at the Crane Release Pavilion sells for as much as two thousand yuan a cup, because many people go there to cool off. The Youth Center is planning to screen outdoor movies. The Night Garden is about to open again. West Lake in summer begins to stir in the dusk and slowly quiets down only in the deep of night.</p>
<p>Do Not Forbid Cold Drinks Late, Be Careful Not to Repeat the Absurdity of Last Year</p>
<p>In this early summer season, Indian Ambassador Menon visited Hangzhou, and Bai Chongxi from the Ministry of Agriculture also lingered for five or six days. The Nepalese delegation to China also visited Hangzhou. The Hangzhou Municipal Government is also celebrating its 20th anniversary, erecting a pavilion in Sixth Park on the Lakeside to express remembrance of the past municipal administrators. We hope that the municipal administrators will not only pay attention to the scenic areas but also benefit all the citizens of Hangzhou. Although the lakeside and the main roads are relatively clean, in many small streets and alleys in residential areas, foul odors waft out as summer arrives, making people sick when they smell them. Furthermore, medical and health conditions are still not progressive enough. Ordinary households still drink "sky water." The power of Hangzhou gods and the prosperity of many unexamined traditional Chinese medicine practitioners prove that new medical and health practices are not widespread enough. With the arrival of summer, many seasonal diseases will proliferate. This spring, there was little rainfall, so many pathogens may be lurking. Our country often locks the stable after the horse is stolen. Disease prevention is mostly a case of digging a well when thirsty. Now, we must appeal to the health authorities to quickly carry out various propaganda campaigns to prevent epidemics. At the same time, starting today, begin administering vaccinations, starting today, establish quarantine stations, and ensure that information about epidemics is absolutely accurate, so that the source of epidemics can be extinguished. Cold drinks must also be instructed and checked in advance, and we must not repeat the absurdity of last year, when cold drinks were banned only at the end of the summer, resulting in a joke.</p>
<p>The Beautiful Scenery of Inner West Lake, Giant Lotus Pads Extend Out of the Lake</p>
<p>In the past few days, the lotus flowers of Inner West Lake have already sprouted, and giant lotus pads, not yet very large, have extended out of the lake surface. West Lake is beautiful in all seasons, so the beauty of summer should take the lotus flower as the main embellishment. After a little while, water caltrop will also grow in the outer and inner lakes. When the boatman rows through the water caltrop vines, pulling on one will provide a string of water caltrop for you to chew. In the early morning before the sun rises, you can take a sampan to Inner Lake, or to Yue Wang Temple, or to Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, or to Liu Zhuang, to enjoy the fragrant lotus flowers, which is quite meaningful. When your small boat enters the lotus thickets, a wave of intoxicating fragrance will intoxicate you, making you forget the world of constant struggle.</p>
<p>Some people say that Hangzhou summers are quite hot. Yes, Hangzhou is indeed quite hot, but if you can stay for a short time on Xiaoying Islet, or in Lingfeng Temple, or in Longjing Temple, or in Yanxia Cave, it is quite cool. Let me tell you, Dr. Hu Shih once lived next to Yanxia Cave for a summer.</p>

<h3>Reverie - Dedicated to my most respected friend JS</h3>
<p>— Yang Yifu</p>
<p>That former love, once etched sorrowful light traces in the depths of my soul, sparkling brilliantly. I will never forget those dreamlike bygone days... whispered words in the morning at Zhaofeng Garden, leisurely strolls on Shanzhong Road at dusk, listening to Reverie at the Tàdá Hotel late at night, the Christmas Eve dance under candlelight, prayers before the statue of the Holy Mother in church, farewell kisses in the misty night... These cloudlike past events; these shadowy figures in my dreams, tightly entwine my soul, allowing me to quietly yearn in contemplation; to quietly feel melancholy in remembrance; to silently shed tears in reminiscence. I don't remember how many times I have subconsciously told myself: "Forget it! We live for today, not for the past." However, who can forget sorrow as easily as forgetting joy?</p>
<p>At dusk, the streets were unusually desolate, and I slowly strolled home from school alone. The inconsiderate east wind gently blew, and a gust after gust blew on the loose hair on my shoulders, suddenly making me feel a pang of inexplicable melancholy, a sense of causeless light sorrow... Who says this isn't "being deeply troubled by unfeeling things"? The twilight gradually deepened, and all the scenes blurred into the smoky haze of the evening.</p>
<p>Returning home, after putting down my books, I discovered a note pressed under the glass on my desk. The familiar handwriting clearly showed that it was written by my uncle: "How is your work going? Are you feeling better? How about having dinner with you tonight? Forgive me for keeping the location a secret for now. Miss, I hope to see your smile tonight. You know I hate seeing you with your eyebrows furrowed. See you at seven sharp." After I finished reading, I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>My uncle is truly my only confidant. He understands me the most. When I am at my most pained, he not only gives me a lot of comfort but also tries his best to make me happy. However, he has failed. I feel sorry for him. I know I have let down his good intentions. But I cannot deny that he is indeed lovable. When you are with him, he can allow you absolute freedom. You can say whatever you want, and you can do whatever you want, as long as you feel happy, he seems to be even happier. I like him because his personality is somewhat similar to mine. He is not selfish. He does not take his own happiness as happiness but takes the happiness of others as happiness.</p>
<p>I happily pushed open the small window. In the twilight, a pale crescent moon was already hanging on the treetops.</p>
<p>I walked to the dressing table, applied a thin layer of powder, dabbed on some light lipstick, and then hurriedly opened the wardrobe. I was considering which dress I should wear. My gaze first fell on that evening dress with a light blue background and scattered rose flowers. I don't know how long I haven't worn it. I couldn't help but take it out, looked at it, and then quietly hung it back up. No, I don't want to wear it because it reminds me of Hua Hua. This evening dress was his favorite. I took down that silver-gray one, thinking, wouldn't it be better to wear something plain?</p>
<p>My uncle arrived, and I hurriedly got into the car. In the car, I couldn't help but ask him: "Where are you planning to take me?"</p>
<p>He smiled: "You'll know in a little while."</p>
<p>The car's speed was quite fast, and the streetlights constantly sped backward. Finally, the car stopped. I got out of the car, and all I saw before me was a bright light. I looked up and saw the dazzling neon lights flashing the four red characters "Tàdá Hotel." I was stunned: "Uncle, why come here...?"</p>
<p>"Why?" As he said this, he took my hand and walked step by step up the stone steps: "Isn't it good to listen to music?"</p>
<p>At this moment, I really didn't know what to do, but I had already unconsciously been pulled in by him. I followed him to the round table by the long window and sat down. My uncle was busy ordering dishes. Although I sat quietly, my thoughts surged like the evening tide. This familiar yet unfamiliar hall was still so brightly lit. This band of musicians, whom I seemed to have met before, was still playing heart-stirring music. There was a time when Hua Hua and I listened to music here almost every night; however, now, I didn't even want to calculate how many days it had been since I had been here. Although I had hoped that one day I would be able to come here again, drink a cup of hot coffee, or drink a cup of sweet wine, listen to a piece of music, and savor the bitter past, I never had the courage. However, tonight, now, I was already sitting here, and I couldn't help but feel excited and agitated inside.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of clear, flowing bells echoed from the music stage. This familiar and lingering melody told me that it was "Reverie" (Souvenir). These sounds of strings penetrated into the depths of my soul, almost freezing my blood. At this time, the shadow of Hua Hua floated into my mind again. Although I tried my best to suppress my emotions, I knew that my eyes were wet.</p>
<p>"Yifu, what's wrong? Don't you like this place?" I think he must have caught a glimpse of the tears in the corners of my eyes.</p>
<p>"No, I don't mean that," I avoided his gaze, staring at the music stage in the distance, and slowly said, "This is Hua Hua's favorite song."</p>
<p>My uncle didn't say anything. He was silent for a moment before whispering to me, "Silly child, still so infatuated?"</p>
<p>I turned around and said, "I don't know, maybe what cannot be forgotten can never be forgotten," and whispered, "Now I know that forgetting something is much more difficult than remembering something."</p>
<p>Dinner began. He raised the glass of purple-red wine and touched my glass, saying, "A toast to your health and happiness."</p>
<p>"Thank you." I also raised the glass of wine and drank it all in one gulp.</p>
<p>While eating fish, I couldn't help but ask him, "Is there really no news about Hua Hua at all? Is he just missing forever, never coming back?"</p>
<p>He lit a cigarette, "I hope you still think that way, it's better," he exhaled a thick cloud of smoke, "if you still love him."</p>
<p>"Yes, I love him," I couldn't suppress my emotions and said excitedly, "I love him, although now I have realized that love is just beautiful pain, because the price of love is paid with love."</p>
<p>The lights gradually dimmed, and the music changed from melodious and poignant to cheerful and bright. In the dim light, I vaguely saw my uncle staring at me, his gentle gaze seemed to be telling me that he sympathized with me.</p>
<p>At this time, I believed that my feelings were even more difficult than his. A wave of irrepressible sadness welled up in my heart. I hated myself for why I had ruined the harmonious atmosphere of this dinner again.</p>
<p>At this moment, we both fell silent again. The waiter brought the desserts and coffee. I took a sip of the sweet and bitter coffee: "Uncle, I really don't know how to thank you," I looked at him affectionately and said, "For so many days, you have been like my beacon, illuminating my dark path. You are also like my clear spring, relieving my parched life. You give me work, so that I can forget a lot of pain in the busyness, so that I can entrust my love and passion to the crowd, making me live more meaningfully and more valuable. I remember you once said: Life is about giving, not taking. From now on, I must become stronger..."</p>
<p>He smiled and held my slender hands, saying, "I know you are a good child. This world is not as bad as you think. There is still happiness and joy. May you always be the master of your own life and find your happiness back. My sympathy may be superfluous."</p>
<p>"No, if there is still a little beauty in this world, this little bit of beauty may be warm friendship."</p>
<p>He smiled and nodded, and I also smiled and said to him, "Are you willing for me to always be one of your many friends?"</p>
<p>He shifted his gaze to the window and smiled, "Please don't forget that I don't like seeing friends with furrowed eyebrows." I couldn't help but burst out laughing.</p>
<p>The lights dimmed and lit up again, and the music was playing Farewell Waltz, a waltz full of parting feelings. In this sad and soul-stirring music, we walked out of the Tàdá Hotel.</p>
<p>The night was already late, and it was midnight when my uncle took me home. The night was noisy and people were quiet. I quietly leaned by the window, the Milky Way was faintly visible, and a crescent moon was already hanging in the sky. The leisurely evening breeze blew on the loose hair on my shoulders, one gust after another. It was extremely quiet. Suddenly, it seemed that bursts of clear string music drifted from the evening breeze, constantly echoing in my ears—wasn't that the lingering "Reverie"? I couldn't help but close my eyes tightly and silently offer my most sincere evening prayer, wishing that tonight's evening breeze could carry my blessings to the West tens of thousands of miles away.</p>

<h3>The grass on the grave is green</h3>
<p>— Lan Ge</p>
<p>On the grave, the grass is green</p>
<p>Quietly covering the ditch</p>
<p>Spreading into the green field</p>
<p>The year before last, some grave diggers came</p>
<p>Their strong arms wielding iron</p>
<p>Digging a pit</p>
<p>Putting a coffin in</p>
<p>Then heavily covering it with a layer of soil</p>
<p>Turning the green grass over</p>
<p>Deeply buried underground</p>
<p>Close to the white coffin</p>
<p>Last year, in the tender yellow of April</p>
<p>The green grass sprouted again</p>
<p>Bursting out from underground</p>
<p>Reporting a message:</p>
<p>'I have been resting for a year</p>
<p>Life underground is very quiet</p>
<p>Although the coffin has rotted</p>
<p>But I am even fatter'</p>
<p>From the vast fields</p>
<p>The shepherd boy came</p>
<p>The scarecrow came</p>
<p>The drunkard came</p>
<p>The women came</p>
<p>Their feet ruthlessly trampled on</p>
<p>The sharp knives coarsely and coldly cut</p>
<p>The livestock lowered their heads</p>
<p>Patiently gnawing</p>
<p>But no one noticed</p>
<p>The ground covered with green grass</p>
<p>In the autumn, in the quiet fields</p>
<p>The withered grass drooped its head</p>
<p>The naughty children came</p>
<p>Setting a wildfire on the grave</p>
<p>The withered grass scorched black</p>
<p>The grave became even more desolate</p>
<p>This year, the third year…</p>
<p>The scorched black</p>
<p>Grave, the grass is green again</p>
<p>Quietly covering the ditch</p>
<p>Spreading into the green field</p>
<p>But still no one notices</p>

<h3>May</h3>

<p>A green plum, a maiden’s heart.</p>
<p>Changeable May, full of suffering,</p>
<p>Grains of white rice, strings of tears,</p>
<p>Drops of yellow oil, bodies of sweat,</p>
<p>A cry of price increase, a cry ,</p>
<p>A rainy day, a poor man’s face.</p>
<h3>Spinning Girl</h3>
<p>— You</p>
<p>Carrying the destiny endowed by God,</p>
<p>Carrying the sorrow endowed by life:</p>
<p>The spinning girl accompanies the spinning wheel alone.</p>
<p>She begins to gaze at the stretching cotton,</p>
<p>Memories of youth…</p>
<p>Brilliant dreams are drawn into the spindle.</p>
<p>Working hard to warm people,</p>
<p>Yet on herself;</p>
<p>Hang tattered clothes and tear stains.</p>
<p>Sorrow tightly locks her brows,</p>
<p>Wiping away a tear, forever;</p>
<p>Rocking... rocking.</p>
<p>Like a devoted shepherdess guarding her flock,</p>
<p>She…</p>
<p>Just as always, accompanies the spinning wheel alone.</p>
<h3>Nocturne</h3>
<p>— Tang Kuangying</p>
<p>My Lost Love</p>
<p>When I was young, I fell in love with the bend in the river in front of my door. When I was young, I fell in love with the lamp while reading late at night. Now, as I gradually enter middle age, the river and the lamp, although they only teach me to recall them briefly, are still clearly visible. However, after crossing thousands of mountains and rivers, my heart that loves humanity and loves nature has been eroded by storms and giant waves, and its brilliance has faded.</p>
<p>Now, I know how to fall in love with myself.</p>
<p>"Ten thousand people are like the sea, one body is hidden"!</p>
<p>I am willing to be at the depths of the sea, watching the bubbles floating on the surface wriggle. I only relive these tidal past events, and the years flow like water.</p>
<p>I seem to have begun to lose love with everything with the temperament of a middle-aged person.</p>
<p>Banner Shadow</p>
<p>A sudden gust of wind, my heart banner fluttered and became chaotic again.</p>
<p>Is it the heart moving? Is it the banner moving? The east wind is silent. I, this traveler from afar, am pushed into the depths of emotion by the dusk of tonight.</p>
<p>Relighting the lonely lamp of my heart, to the depths of my heart banner, I repent and hate myself a thousand times: I want to make myself a lonely lamp in the sea of people, illuminating the homebound voyages in the darkness, coming and going among people.</p>
<p>I remember that sentence in the Buddhist scriptures: "For example, a bright lamp can extinguish all darkness. If it is with darkness, it is not called a lamp."</p>
<p>Folding the heart banner, I want to hold on to this faint light in the wind and rain.</p>
<p>Wild Rooster</p>
<p>On my pillow, listening to the crowing of the wild rooster in the desolate village, I suddenly remembered that I was a guest thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>Nothing makes people more sober than the dead of night. On the pillow, I pushed the past events of a dozen years ago to the front, and then moved myself a dozen years later to the bedside. In the dozens of years in between, I was just a prisoner of God; He only gave me a machine to digest bread, but I suffered decades of persecution by mankind and was a prisoner of the soul for decades.</p>
<p>Everyone has groped in the darkness at their clearest time, and everyone has forgotten the crowing of the rooster at dawn. The crowing of the rooster is wearing away the lives and vitality of more people.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 518</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Shouyi: "Ha, you are still talking like a child. Please flip through history. Over the millennia, which few invaded countries or races, in tens or hundreds of years, did not assimilate the invaders but instead ruled over them? The Javanese tribe that invaded India before the Common Era had long since fallen into the 'untouchable' class of the Indian country. The Normans who captured the British Isles took pride in being stained with the blood of the locals. Do you know that when Kublai Khan fought to several countries in Europe along the Mediterranean Sea, he left part of his troops in those defeated countries, and they were later assimilated by the people. If you don't believe it, now in these countries, especially Hungary, there are still many descendants of my country from the Yuan Dynasty who still retain many customs of my country, but their blood and race have long been digested by the local people..."</p>
<p>"So, you think it doesn't matter to be a subjugated slave, and after a few decades or hundreds of years, you can assimilate the invading country and turn it into a victor?" He Jian sees that Shouyi's theory contains excessive transcendence, and it seems that even subjugation doesn't matter, so he asks so impolitely; the sentences inevitably contain some degree of high irony.</p>
<p>Shouyi: "You misunderstand me somewhat excessively. I do not approve of the passive self-destruction, but I do not approve of deliberately preparing for aggression and wanting to destroy other people's countries. A nation can never be wiped out, unless this nation is small and degenerate to the point where it should be eliminated by nature... So this should be separated into two sides to say; The first side, aggression is useless; because the possessive nature of aggression only lasts for a few years, a few decades, and at most three or four hundred years, this possessive nature of aggression will be eliminated by the active or passive resistance, or survival resistance of the invaded. This also fits the law of survival of the fittest; because military aggression; or other types of aggressors, are not necessarily superior races, and those who are invaded are not necessarily inferior races. The formation of aggression only lies in the fact that one has the preparation and training of aggressive tools, and one does not take this into account...</p>
<p>... However, it is a matter of course for a nation to be strong and survive: to strive for strength is only to take a global perspective as the scope, to set an example for itself, and to do everything possible to maintain and promote the pure culture and true culture that are not extinct in the world. In this way, those barbaric nations who have put on the coats of material civilization, but are actually beasts who harm their own kind, can be slowly influenced and instilled with some true culture. So, striving for strength is not preparing for aggression, nor is it preparing to resist aggression.</p>
<p>"In order to strive for strength and survival, one should follow the times. The times have now embarked on the path of science, so we should also concentrate the talents and resources of the whole country to study science, not only following behind others, but also taking a step forward and walking ahead. However, the goal of studying science is to seek happiness for mankind; it should not be like those selfish and self-interested military groups, like robbers and bandits, secretly studying scientific weapons, and then forcibly and domineeringly robbing mankind and destroying culture..."</p>
<h3>White Dove</h3>
<p>— Jiang Dun</p>
<p>I admire that blue sky, even more I admire the white dove flock.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the fluttering corner of a blue garment. You, the child of the seaside, are as beautiful and pure as a white dove! Like a youthful dream, your eyes are as deep as the sea, filled with the vitality of youth, brimming with the radiance of wisdom, and also revealing a hint of sorrow... Beneath your elegant nose, there is a smiling mouth like a budding flower. The wavy hair draped over your shoulders further sculpts your beautiful face! Thinking of you makes me think of the white dove symbolizing happiness and peace, the poetic goddess draped in a veil of clouds—</p>
<p>In the hearts of all who are newly in love, everyone is a beautiful white dove, and his and her hearts are a blue sky. In their pulses, one can distinctly hear a sublime and sacred melody like "Ave Maria." Although the world is ugly, and although people have their sins, first love is as pure as a white dove.</p>
<p>Blue sky, a blue sky without mist, a sunlit blue sky, like our hearts, setting off our white dove of love even more beautifully.</p>
<p>In a dark life, we should admire that blue sky, admire that flock of white doves...</p>
<p>Because only love can make our lives stronger, more radiant, and more beautiful!</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Poetry</h3>
<p>— Keng Qiang</p>
<p>Poetry is the alarm bell of the times. It is not limited by time and space, and constantly sounds, awakening the dregs of society and the laggards of the times.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk from a Lonely Anchorage</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>"Fickleness" is the behavior of petty people.</p>
<p>Some so-called gentlemen, who mutually praise each other under the banner of the Peking School, criticize the "Shanghai School" as shameless. In fact, what the "Shanghai School" values is "A word spoken is an arrow that cannot be recalled," it is the righteousness of the Jianghu.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is nothing wrong with "Shanghai." A rascal who points at his own nose and says, "I am a rascal" is at least frank and straightforward.</p>
<p>What is most frightening are those gentlemen who hide daggers and claim to be saviors.</p>
<p>S likes to eat braised duck.</p>
<p>I jokingly said, "I will nail a nail to your nose. Then hang the braised duck on it. When you have nothing to do, you can lick it with your tongue. This can be used as a novel decoration. (This is no different from wearing earrings.) And you can often taste what you like to eat."</p>
<p>This remark of mine aroused T's fallacy. He said:</p>
<p>"There was a strange man who was born with two completely different eyes, one was a human eye, and the other was a dog eye.</p>
<p>Whenever the strange man eats, he will immediately be aroused with two completely different feelings. When the human eye sees feces, it produces a feeling of disgust, while the dog eye, when it sees feces, sees it as if it were the most delicious delicacy on the table."</p>
<p>I think if there really were such a strange person, his mouth would be the most painful and contradictory. Should he obey the human eye? Or should he follow the dog eye?</p>
<p>If, to be more realistic, in this year of rice as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, a person born with dog eyes is more "blessed."</p>

<h3>Too Much and Not Enough</h3>
<p>— Hua Run</p>
<p>A recent issue of the pictorial Life mentioned that the American family system is increasingly collapsing, posing a serious threat to Western civilization. The reason is that the divorce rate in the United States has reached an alarming peak: one in every three marriages ends in divorce. The reasons for divorce are so broad as to be beyond description. Couples can file for divorce as long as there is the slightest dissatisfaction between them. In particular, wives cannot tolerate any minor flaws in their husbands. For example, an issue of Time magazine published a story about a woman over fifty years old who sued her husband, who was over sixty years old, for abandonment and abuse, demanding a divorce. As for the evidence of abandonment and abuse, it was that the old gentleman was reading "Forever Amber" in bed. Another woman filed a lawsuit in court, demanding a divorce, on the grounds that her husband called her a "tomahawk" used by American Indians. Such cases, which would not constitute grounds for divorce in other countries in the world, are commonplace and very common in the United States. As the number of divorce cases increases, sexual morality fundamentally loses its existence, and children are thus deprived of the blessing of valuable family education.</p>
<p>Americans take divorce so lightly, which we always feel is too much.</p>
<p>But when we look back at ourselves, it seems that we are not enough. That is to say, we take divorce "too seriously," and are therefore willing to endure all the pain, and even sacrifice lifelong happiness. Couples regard each other as enemies until they die. In such families, children have no good family education to speak of. What they get is resentment, sorrow, cruelty, and other vicious and abnormal emotions and psychology. Under such circumstances, sexual morality can also be destroyed.</p>
<p>The ancients valued the status of a wedded couple, and there were also admonitions such as "Do not abandon a wife who shared hardship." They believed that after the decision of parents and the words of a matchmaker, it was a destiny determined by heaven, and it should never be broken up. Even if there was a separation, it was usually the husband driving out the wife, presumably because she had committed one of the "seven grounds for divorce." As for the woman, she would follow the chicken if she married a chicken, and follow the dog if she married a dog, and there was no possibility of her independently breaking away from the relationship with her husband. This trend is still very popular to this day, and has thus cultivated a psychology that if a man and woman divorce, it must be because the woman has done something wrong, thereby incurring social contempt. To this day, many couples with disharmonious feelings are reluctant to marry, often to avoid the damage that the woman will encounter in this regard. Economic reasons are certainly very important, but they are not the first thing to consider.</p>
<p>As for the new type of union, people generally think that since they have fallen in love with each other, how can there be any reason to regret it halfway? Even if they find that their personalities are incompatible, they cannot blame anyone, and they can only admit that they deserve it and prepare to "grow old together." However, they do not realize that personality is extremely elusive, and there are indeed men and women who initially fell in love but eventually became like ice and charcoal and could not tolerate each other. If such couples are forced to stay together, not only will they suffer, but even their children and even relatives and neighbors will feel pain.</p>
<p>Of course, I am not encouraging couples to divorce more. What I mean is that before getting married, the time for dating should be lengthened a little. After getting married, they should be more tolerant of each other. However, once they reach a point where they cannot tolerate each other (especially on the woman's side), they should resolutely file for divorce and seek a mutual liberation.</p>
<h3>The Use of Glasses</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>Girl: Doctor, will I be able to read after I get glasses?</p>
<p>Doctor: Of course.</p>
<p>Girl: That's great. I don't know a single word yet. New Knowledge</p>
<h3>Electric Writing Machine</h3>
<p>— Bai Li</p>
<p>The electric writing machine consists of a sending station and a receiving station.</p>
<p>The sending station is a platform of about two square feet, slightly inclined to facilitate writing; there is a pen on the platform, with two iron bars attached to the pen, and two extremely sensitive wires attached to each iron bar; a bottle of ink is placed on the corner of the platform.</p>
<p>The receiving station is vertical, and its structure is roughly the same as the sending station.</p>
<p>An ordinary telephone is installed next to the electric writing machine, but this telephone can only listen and cannot talk back.</p>
<p>The application of the electric writing machine is as follows: First, use the telephone to dial the number of the other party's electric writing machine. Then run in the brief, if there is a "Qi Qi" sound, this indicates that the circuit between the two parties has been connected and you can start sending the message. If there is no sound, it means that someone else is sending a message to the same number of the electric writing machine, you can wait a few minutes.</p>
<p>Before sending a message, you must press the electric button on the upper right corner of the sending station, and the prepared paper will be rolled up from the bottom, then dip the pen in ink and write on the paper. After one sheet of paper is written, you can press the same electric button again, so that the second sheet of paper will roll up and you can continue writing. After sending the message, you must press the electric button in the lower right corner, and the paper will automatically roll into a prepared wooden box for the sender to save. Then put the receiver on the telephone, and the circuit will be broken.</p>
<p>When you press the upper right corner of the sending station, the paper will also be rolled up from the bottom of the receiving station on the other side; when you lift the pen, the receiving station on the other side will also lift the pen; when you dip the ink, it will also dip the ink; when you write, it will also write. In short, the actions of both parties are completely consistent. When you finish sending the message and press the electric button in the lower right corner, the paper of the receiving station will fall into a specially made wooden box, so that its owner can take it out to view it when he returns.</p>
<p>The electric writing machine was invented by the Swede Rithes, and later modified by the American Franklin.</p>
<p>We can first make a judgment: when the electric writing machine becomes popular all over the world, it will be the end of the postal business.</p>
<h3>Rebuilding the Statue of Peace</h3>
<p>— Ye Lin</p>
<p>Since the Statue of Peace was demolished, the Jianghai Customs has lost its best movie shot, and the gentry and ladies also feel as if they are missing a piece of decoration, which is very disapproving. As for ordinary people like you and me, the goddess is not an important part of this big city, so whether she exists or not seems to have little to do with life. Only when we occasionally pass the stone seat of the statue and see bird droppings everywhere, we feel that this place, like other parts of the city, has become overgrown.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I heard that the goddess had been found, and everyone was happy. They were happy that she had not fortunately crossed the sea to become an accomplice of the warmongers. It was only rumored that she had broken wings and broken arms, and the scene was very miserable. However, after all, the goddess is ignorant, not as needy as the disabled beggars on the street. So after a long time, people forgot about it. However, our municipal authorities attach great importance to this matter, probably because it is related to the appearance of the city and concerns international image. Recently, it was said that it would be rebuilt, and the cost would be 300 million yuan. In other words, each citizen would have to bear 70 or 80 yuan, which is not enough for a streetcar ride, so it is naturally a small matter, but it is a huge expenditure for the municipal government.</p>
<p>Of course, although this expenditure is huge, it is probably important. The rebuilding of the goddess can be expected soon. Once completed, firstly, Shanghai will have another beautiful decoration, secondly, it will give people a little thought of peace, and thirdly, it will take care of international public opinion. As for the embellishment of the Bund, it is even more of a trivial matter. I only hope that those sensitive poets will not regard it as satire. As for us, since we are not paying out of our own pockets, we are naturally happy to see it completed.</p>
<p>Comparative Observation of the Depreciation of Currency Values in Various Countries After the War Jian Zhe</p>
<p>During the war, countless amounts of wealth turned into ashes, causing post-war inflation and the shrinking of the purchasing power of currencies in various countries. Whether it is a US dollar bill, a British pound, or a French franc, it cannot buy as much as it did before the war.</p>
<p>The attached figure shows the percentage of the purchasing power of currencies in major countries at the end of 1946 compared with the purchasing power in 1911-1919 (pre-war).</p>
<p>The currency value of Hungary is close to reaching zero. Italy was both a battlefield and a defeated country in this war, resulting in a sharp drop in currency value. Because the United Kingdom implemented controls, the situation was relatively good, but due to a shortage of materials, even if there was money, there was almost no goods to buy.</p>
<p>Movie Talk</p>
<h3>"The Pink Bomb"</h3>
<p>— Wu Bian</p>
<p>Some film editors who stayed in Shanghai during the occupation found themes in the "underground work" circle for their works after the victory, such as "Number One Under Heaven", "From Darkness to Dawn", "Tides of the Sea of Desire", etc. Now this "Pink Bomb" is no exception.</p>
<p>These stories describing "underground work" lack real life. They are just dramatists' conceptual manipulations of characters. Those characters have no flesh and blood, no personality, no life, and naturally no thoughts. How can such a script move the audience and resonate with it?</p>
<p>"Pink Bomb" portrays the female spy Lu Peijuan as so elusive, alert, and brave, while the special commissioner Xu Gongwang is so careless, confused, and absurd. He casually puts the most important documents in his bedroom without any vigilance. Two enemy henchmen effortlessly cracked his important organization, making this group of intelligence agents almost wiped out in one fell swoop. This is simply a satire. Furthermore, the enemy's investigation director and the investigation team leader are both lustful. They forget everything when they see a woman. This is also unbelievable. I think people who have been in the occupied areas will not forget the ferocious faces and insidious methods of those enemy henchmen, secret agents, and running dogs. And it is too unlikely that an enemy puppet agent like the investigation team leader can still have a conscience and repent. Moreover, the only explanation in the play for his repentance is that the pain and struggle of his lover (singer Liang Manling) during the torture stimulated him. Then what if the tortured woman was not his lover? It is absolutely impossible for such a character to change his life just for one woman, and moreover, to place great sympathy on such a running dog character is a terrible poison.</p>
<p>Content determines form. The director's handling of the play is also mediocre and lacks characteristics. Gu Lan Jun's acting has no development, and Yan Hua's acting is too excessive. The only commendable thing is Cang Yinqiu's portrayal of the director's wife.</p>
<h3>Nazi Tactics</h3>
<p>— Yamaguchi</p>
<p>There was a photo proving that Hitler's invading army quickly changed the conquered people and made them pay tribute to the Nazis. A British shortwave radio station revealed how the Germans used a Parisian outdoor concert at the time.</p>
<p>"Suddenly, the music stopped being played by a voice speaking loudly in French, 'Raise your hands if you don't speak a Germanic language!'"</p>
<p>In fact, none of these people knew that there were Germans among them, and millions upon millions of hands were raised. A flash! The posture of all the people standing at attention and raising their hands, just like the Hitler salute, were all photographed.</p>
<h3>Literary and Art Scene</h3>
<p>The first book "Martin Eden" of the World Literature Translation Series edited by Mr. Hu Feng has been published. The original work is by the American writer Jack London, translated by Zhou Xing. It is a novel with autobiographical meaning by the author. The famous writer Sinclair once praised it as one of Jack London's greatest works. He put his whole soul into it. It is currently sold by the Shanghai Newspaper and Magazine United Distribution Office.</p>
<p>The 17th issue of "Home" edited by Huang Jiayin in June has been published early. The contents include "Implementation of Sex Education" by Dr. Cheng Yuchen, a psychiatric expert, "Healthy Baby Discussions in the United States" by Dr. Zhu Juefang, a child welfare expert, "Recognizing Infertility Through Anatomy" by Dr. Liu Benli, and "How Food Helps Excretion" by Professor Liang Jingyi, a nutritional expert who studied in the United States.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Dangerous City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The town of Jinchengjiang is quite far from the highway, but very close to the railway station. Many commercial vehicles that take the highway also stop in the town for the convenience of loading goods. The cars departing from there are the starting point, unlike the passing vehicles, so they should be more empty in theory. Old Zhu felt that the military policeman did remind him.</p>
<p>He was running frantically on this three- or four-mile-long road. He was not only anxious, but also a little confused. Several times he wanted to purse his lips and blow a piece of his favorite tune "51115271...", but he failed.</p>
<p>When passing the large wooden bridge spanning the Jinchengjiang River, he heard the sound of a harmonica coming up from under the bridge, mixed with the innocent laughter of a little girl. He knew that Zhang Chang and the others were playing with Fei Fei, but he couldn't muster up the interest to greet them. He just changed from a quick walk to a slow walk, and breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The original three or four small hotels built entirely of bamboo outside the town still stood on both sides of the road. Old Zhu suspected that the news of the fire that Lu Qian heard was not true; but after walking two or three hundred steps, the most tragic scene of fire unfolded before his eyes. The small town that originally existed between the railway and the former railway hotel had completely disappeared, but he could not see the remaining walls and ruins that usually existed after a fire, because there was no tiled house in this town except for the railway hotel. All of them were awnings made of bamboo and wood; after the fire, all that remained were piles of ashes.</p>
<p>The baptism of fire that Jinchengjiang suffered this time was even more thorough than the previous two times. All the shops and houses were burned to the ground, and the furniture, clothes, and everything turned into ashes. Even several trucks parked near the railway station were burned into skeleton-like wreckage.</p>
<p>Walking to the edge of this scorched black town, Zhu Zhaonian's heart was already half cold. He looked around him despondently; the original path could no longer be recognized at all. Occasionally, he could still see the corpses of people burned into dead trees, lying scattered next to those living people whose hands were empty after being burned by the fire. Traces of the explosion of artillery shells and bullets could also be seen far away from the railway station.</p>
<p>"These damn bastards"! Thinking of how tense the war was at the front, and yet there were a large number of munitions here, which were squandered so much due to the irresponsibility of those absurd officers, and even destroyed a town in the process, Old Zhu couldn't help but crack his eyes and curse loudly.</p>
<p>"Bastard! Are you still scolding me"? Suddenly, a cold and trembling voice came from the left side of his body.</p>
<p>Old Zhu turned his head in surprise.</p>
