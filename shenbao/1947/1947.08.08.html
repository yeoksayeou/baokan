<h3>對日和約初步會議　已定九月十日舉行　美正調和各國不同見解</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山七日廣播，據消息靈通方面講：對日和約初步會議，已定九月十日舉行，俾不致與聯合國全體大會日期有所衝突。屆時蘇聯如仍堅持原來建議，則會議將在缺少蘇聯情形下舉行，聞英·澳建議，最初數次會談，應由外長進行，美方對此表示同意。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓六日電〕馬歇爾今稱：美國已接獲十個國家對美國邀請召開對日和約籌備會議之覆文，各國對如何推動此事之見解，雖各不同，然俱同意盡速行動。馬氏今在記者招待會上稱：美國對將來出席該會各國所提出的建議，尚未答覆，美國正設法覓取途徑，俾調和各種不同見解，美國尚未答覆蘇聯當舉行外長會議，而不當舉行遠東委會十一國代表會議之建議。馬氏並未表示該會將於何時舉行，惟僉信原來暫定之八月十九日已告延期。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約六日電〕紐約前錄論壇報社論，力主早日締結對日和約，但謂和約如阻止完成美国对日之计划，则不如不订。该報謂：過去以和約未訂，曾重重阻碍，麥帥爲使日本工業復與，日政府有一鞏固之經濟基礎而作之種種努力，以應日本若干工業部門之展望，發生不安狀態，因此，欲使甚多工廠復業，幾不可能。蓋此等工廠，在一二年內可能給與中國或菲律賓作爲賠償。該報復謂：和約之困難亦多，如蘇聯之反對美國建議由十一國遠東經委會代表起草，由三分之二票數決定，即其一例。該報指出，蘇聯竟圖堅持莫斯科對所有條約條款之否決權，欲遂其控制東方擴大民眾之一貫目的，該報於論評中國建議該和約之決定須至少由三個最有切身利益國家同意時，曾謂：此種建議，顯由中國人士之極端恐懼另一强盛之日本復興及另一中日戰事發生所致。</p>

<h3>萬耀煌赴牯前談話　鄂省全境安謐　今後將努力復員建設</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕湖北省主席萬耀煌七日晨離京飛潯，在牯嶺小作勾留後，即行返任。萬氏行前與本報記者談鄂省近情稱，湖北全境已無一名共匪，各縣均甚安謐，爲戰後復員建設工作備一良好之環境，該省在戰時受創至钜，鄂西及西北糜爛尤甚，若干縣城於勝利之時，房屋完好者僅余什一，大部縣市建築均被毀一半以上。漢宜公路爲交通孔道，日人昔爲維持補給綫，曾大事破壞，沿綫五六里以內人烟絕滅，村舍蕩平。過去及將來若干時日，省府之主要任務均在如何從事復員建設，使廢墟重變樂園。渠此番來京係參加田糧會議與行政及兵役座談會。鄂省應徵丁糧賦款之執行均無困難，行政座談會得使中央加深理解地方政治，對將來制度之改進及業務之配合，實有莫大裨益。萬氏對漢市新聞界之善爲輔導政治，深表感慰，且以未能在省招待京滬記者團爲憾，並於談及漢市中山公園門前之蔣主席躍馬銅隊時，盛讚雕塑家劉開渠技藝之精。</p>
<p>〔本報牯嶺七日電〕萬耀煌七日下午四時自京飛潯轉抵牯嶺，定三日後飛漢。萬氏在京公畢轉牯探詢其公子病况。本報記者今與萬氏同機抵此，特訪詢萬氏晋京之收獲及中樞措施之感想。萬稱：「吾人感覺今日中國之政治，業已步向民主之途，吾人亦極願秉承中央意旨以奉行之，俾中央與地方之政令得以配合」。</p>
<h3>滬市工業團體代表　陳述對日貿易意見　在京請願盼政府取得主動</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕滬工業協會機器國貨工業聯合會等團體，爲政府開放對日貿易事，特派代表胡伯翔，毛聖棟等十五人來京請願，胡等七日晨抵京後，即赴國府·政院·全經會·經濟部·社會部等機關請願，由陳局長方·甘秘書長·樓秘書長·陳部長·谷部長等接見，代表等即陳述關於開放對日貿易意見，說明我國工商業戰前受日貨傾銷影響，無法開展，抗戰時期又受重大損失，迄未恢復，故以前曾要求政府暫緩開放對日貿易，現政府旣因國策及國際情勢所趨，局部開放對日貿易，工商界特提出下列意見，盼予採納，（一）政府旣已確定開放對日貿易，似應採納民意，博詢周詳，早日確定此次局部開放對日貿易事具體計畫，始可取得主動，而有利於國家。凡本國能自製者，即不許日貨進口，同時亦不應以原料供日製造成商品後再銷中國，造成工業日本，農業中國現象。（二）商務代表產生必須確定其職權，誓爲團體服務，根絕私人謀利企圖，國營·民營·無分彼此，商界·工界·通力合作，組織旣可健全，官民得免隔閡。（三）爲防止走私舞弊起見，應加強組織緝私機構，由工商團體通力協助，全國人民共同檢舉，國營進步極速，未必不能與日貨抗爭。政府對於南洋市塲，應取更進一步保護政策。陳局長等表示對工商界意見必能予以採納，並說明此次開放對日貿易限制極嚴，日本進口決不致似想象之容易，同時，對於走私等事，政府亦將嚴予防範，代表　聞言，殊感滿意。又首都商會方面對於派代表赴日事，盼京市亦能分配得二三名。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕滬工業協會曁全滬各工業同業公會，爲限額輸入原料分配權問題來京請願，滬工協會總幹事田和卿，並曾就此向新聞界有所報告。</p>
<p>菲島測驗僑領意見　對日貿易皆乏興味</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕對日貿易指導委會即成立，委員七人聞主席將由經濟部長担任，其他交部·外部·資委會·中信局·財部·全國經委會等有關機關，咸將派代表參加。</p>
<p>〔本報太原七日電〕省府電經部，請准貿易，晋興兩公司對日貿易。</p>
<p>〔合眾社馬尼刺七日電〕馬尼刺七日向華僑領袖舉行民意測驗之結果，華僑領袖對日私人貿易皆不感興味。此間大部份華僑皆感覺日人將利用此事作爲槓桿，重建貿易關係，再度造成威脅東方之局勢。大致菲方與華方之商業界，對於與前敵國日本之貿易重開，甚少熱忱。</p>
<p>有關日本貿易資料　艾其森氏拒絕供給</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京七日電〕盟國對日管制委員會主席美代表艾其森，今日拒絕將日本對外貿易及生產展望之情報供給蘇聯代表，其理由爲蘇聯所需詳細廣泛之情報，無法編成特種形式發表。四國代表團經由委員會之正式申請，被美國拒絕，尚屬首次。蘇聯方面由吉斯倫柯代表特萊夫揚柯出席，詢問日本在本年內可由私人貿易及政府交換輸出者將爲何種貨物及其約數若干。日政府對於增加原料生產及出口貨物，作何進行，其妨礙生產發展之原因爲何，並擬如何增加生產。艾其森答稱：麥帥總部每月發表佔領報告，總司令部亦按斯詳細公布日本及佔領軍方面之各種發展，總部所屬各組，對於其特殊工作之進行，亦常分別發出報告。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京七日電〕第三十八次管制日本委員會，七日上午由蘇聯代表團之要求，特舉行會議，討論日本之輸出問題，首由艾其森會長表示反對之態度稱：「蘇聯方面要求提供關於日本貿易問題之情報，而委員會並非蒐集情況之機關」。中國代表團團長商震將軍亦主張稱：「麥帥對於管制日本委員會未表示任何意見之前，而擅自決定開放日本之民間貿易，吾人對此實不能不予關心，故委員會應提出關於貿易問題之資料」，該會未得結論而散會。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>裴斐教授的錯覺！</h3>
<p>美國名教授裴斐，於去年來華遊歷返國後，最近在哈布斯雜誌七月份，發表一文，以「退出中國此其時矣」為題，指出美國阻制蘇聯侵入中國，僅有三條道路可走：（一）由中國改革政治，成立為人民所雍戴之政府，並實行社會改革，庶不致引政極端份子的革命；（二）襲於過戶第一條道路需時較久，美國必須駐軍中國邊界，以防制蘇聯侵入中國；（三）美國特期勞力退出中國，保持真正的中立，同時並向蘇聯聲明，美國退出中國之後，蘇聯不得乘虛而入。裴斐教授並謂第一條道路最為安全：第二條道路，不切實際，美國與論界不會表示贊同；第三條道路，除非第三次大戰無法避免，否則亦為可行的途徑。</p>
<p>裴斐教授由中國教育部約請來華遠隊講學，先後達六個月之久，憑其對於遠東問題的研究，對於中國實際情形，論理不應該如此隔膜，但是我們看了裴斐教授的大作，不得不表示甚大的詫異。裴斐教授在中國遊歷六個月，並在中國各地，迭次向中國知識份子發表演說，在我們讀者之中，也有一部份人親身聽過他的演說。但很奇怪，裴斐教授觀察中國實際政情，却戴了一副有色眼鏡，在有意無意之間，很想為中國共產黨作側面的辯護，說他們是土地改良主義者，而非暴力革命之徒，甚至有些地方，不但隔靴搔變，且無異指鹿為馬。在太平洋彼岸的美國人土，看到裴斐教授的報道，成者也將會誤信為真。但在我們中國讀者看來，真不知裴斐教授在中國究竟看到些什麼。裴斐教授所說的話，可以認為是。美國左傾記者千篇一律的報道。裴斐教授不來中國實地考察，就發表這種言論，我們或許可以無詞，但是裴斐教授代表來華考察了六個月，竟也人云亦云，使我們對於他「遠東間題的事家」的稱號，不能不表示懷疑了。</p>
<p>裴斐教授對於中國實際政治的運用，既多認識不清，而又處處歪曲事實，我們姑置不論，讓明眼人自已再去辯別。即以其美國防制蘇聯侵入中國的三條道路而論，裴斐教授確是似是而非的。第一，裴斐教授希望中國能革新政治，並實行社會改革，以防制共產黨勢力的擴張。他站在中國之友的地位，向中國發出忠告，我們自應拜受睜言。中國朝野，對於目前的現實，也可說沒有一個人完全認為滿意的，沒有一個人不想設法改善，不論在政治上，經濟上，社會上，都已有革新的象徵，只要中共不以武力相阻擾，這種革新的成不為其必能更速。但是，我們雖然認為中國的政治與社會有澈底改革的必要，但決不相信中國政治革新就能阻制蘇聯的侵入。老實說，蘇聯企圖侵入中國的原因，不在中國而在蘇聯本身的發展與她的爭霸世界的布置。除非中國投入蘇聯的懷抱，蘇聯不會終止其對於中共的支援的。</p>
<p>第二，裴斐教授認為美國唯有駐軍中國邊界，始能阻制蘇聯侵入中國。他本人也知道這種辦法，非美國與論所贊同；明知如此而偏要提出，一方面不啻侮辱中國的國格，另一方面似有意激起美國人民對於中國有所壓惡的情緒。日前　蔣主席曾對美國若干記者稱，希望他們不要濫發中傷中美兩國友誼的言論，我們對於裴斐教授也希望其如此。</p>
<p>第三，裴斐教授主張美國退出中國，保持中立，並各蘇聯聲明，蘇聯亦不得乘虛而入。美國是否退出中國，或保持純粹的中立，這是美國的事情，美國當局可以自由決定，誰也不能免強美國。但是美國退出中國之後，美國若欲以一紙宣言或聲明，而使蘇聯也不乘虛而入，不知道這些「君子協定」有幾位「君子」能夠信守？何況在現行美蘇關係之下，不論在歐洲或在遠東，美蘇兩國因利害不同，處處站在對立的地位，而相持不下，裴斐教授在此時提出此類主張，是否有意為蘇聯在遠東布局？我們無意在遠東硬拉美國下水，但可以斷言，假如美國政府果真採取裴斐教授的如意算盤，則美國在遠東勢必鑄成將來無可挽救的大錯！我們為了遠東永久的和平計，同時也為了美國在遠東的利益計，對於裴斐教授的錯覺，不得不有嚴正的辨答，庶幾中美兩國人民的視聽，不致為他所搖惑！</p>
<h3>第三屆父親節</h3>
<p>今天是第三屆父親節。</p>
<p>上海各界名流，於第二次大戰行將結束之際，為安慰陣亡者之父老起見，乃發起八八父親節；依照當時的計劃，不僅希望全國一致提倡推行父親節，而且還希望能推行及於全世界，成為國際的一個節日。當去年第二屆父親節將屆的時候，他們認為此舉係屬抗戰期間民族正氣之純正表示，大有提倡的必要，除聯名呈請上海市社會局轉呈中央，准予備案並通令全國運行而外，同時又聯合名致盡英，美，法，蘇四盟國駐華大使，轉告各盟國人民共同提倡。</p>
<p>父親節自發起迄今，僅有短短的兩年歷史，在國內尚未獲得中樞政府的正式核准；其在世界各國，對於報德尊親的美德，雖屬人同此心，但是各國也還沒有一致規定八月八日為父親節。故父親節的倡導，離開發起人的初期的理想，自尚有一段距離。正國為如此，我們更有積極提倡身體力行的必要。良以報德尊親，不僅為我民族固有的美德，而且當此滄海橫流，風俗澆薄之日，也正是　國父與　蔣主席所欲發揚光大者。蔣主席於其「報國與思親」一文中曾謂：「唯吾先民這救，以孝為先。總理答語：吾人以中國立國自有其道，不可徒效外國之皮毛，更不可抄襲帝國主義者這道。忠，孝，仁，愛，信　義，和，平　人德，為吾中國立國固有之精神與道德，而孝道尤為　總理遺教所特重。可知中國立國之道，自來皆以孝為本。唯孝莫大於尊親，其次曰不專。所謂尊親，謂當發揚光大吾祖先黃帝之遺緒：所有謂不辱，當勿貽吾父母以隕越之差。」人之所異於禽獸。自知其生之所由來，而不忘其父母之恩，要為最顯著的一點。「君子務本，本立而道生。」天下斷沒有忘本的人而可以言交友，言愛國，言天下一家者。我們幾乎可說，一切的道德起始於孝。由此可知，父親節的含義深長，實在有普徧提倡的價值。</p>
<p>美國在第一次世界大戰告終時，發起母親節，因各國有識之土的積極提倡不遺餘力，早已成為國際性的一個節日了。父親節的含義，不下於母親節，美國駐華大使司徒雷登先生對於中國推行父親節，也曾表示贊成，他說：「仁孝乃世界之美德，貴國發起父親節，報德尊親，消弭戰禍，至深欽佩，自當轉達敝國人士，共同提倡。」所以父親節的推行及於世界各國，成為國際性的節日，將來是非常可能，而我中國人民服從孝道，尤應有當仁不讓之風。我們應請本　這個目標努力，　將中國仁孝的美德，發揮光大，普及全世界，以實現我先哲，老吾老，以及人之老；幼吾幼，以及人之幼」的偉大理想。</p>

<h3>英首相演說要點　闡明政府經濟施政方針</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦六日電〕英相艾德禮頃於本日向下院發表英國自於一九三九年參戰後之最重要演說，敦促全國人進行「新不列顛戰爭」以對抗經濟崩潰之威脅，略謂：當前之新不列顛戰爭，絕非少數人所能取勝，須全國各黨各派熱誠合作，始能取得勝利。</p>
<p>邱吉爾於星期一所發表之演說，謂工黨政府浪費美國借款一節，實屬一種「不幸言論」，但亦實無加以答覆之必要，所需申言者，即此種不幸言論勢將引起反應，使國家蒙受不利。所稱浪費美國借款一節，實非信詞，以言美國與加拿大之借款，英國與全世界乃可藉此取得時間，以求復興，故不但與吾人有利，全世界亦同受其裨益也。吾人本希望此項借款能支持至一九四九年，甚至一九五〇年，屆時吾國之經濟始可獲得轉佳與趨於平衡之機會，但當前之事實已顯示此項借款在本年杪前即將用罄，此皆由於入超，以致美匯漸趨枯竭。艾德禮即列述國內之經濟施政方針如次：</p>
<p>（一）立即減少向外國進購，至少需減少一千二百萬鎊。（二）僅可向外國進購必要之糧食。（三）增加非基本糧食之配給單位價值。（四）倘配給數量須予減低，英推行一種配給計劃，使重工業工人有優先之權。（五）限制酒茶館與旅館之飲食供應。（六）奢侈品進口價值減至五百萬鎊為限。（七）減少木材輸入其價值限爲一千萬鎊。（八）長期購進棉花。（九）自十月一日起減少國外旅行津貼，將原定十二個月七十五鎊減為十四個月卅七鎊，兒童津貼減為二十鎊。（十）商人至國外旅行之津貼，將嚴加限制。（十一）汽油津貼，每月本可獲得行駛三百哩之數量，今將減少三分之一。（十二）商用車輛之汽油津貼，減少百分之十，均自十月一日起實行。（十三）限制外國影片商之匯款，其匯款之數額不得超過其影片所得利潤之百分之廿五。（十四）至十二月紗應撤回海外軍隊十三萬三千人，至明年三月共須撤回二千萬人，減少軍額以不影響外交政策或防務政策爲原則。（十五）英國軍隊至明年三月底，將裁減爲一百萬人，（根據以前決定，擬裁減爲一百〇八萬七千人），俾使男女四十二萬人，可自三月起從事十五個月之工業生產工作。（十六）爲促進生產起見，將設法延長工作時間。</p>
<p>英國外駐軍　將逐步撤退</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕艾德禮首相今日宣布：預定於明年三月底以前將調回國外駐軍二十萬人後，相信其撤退之列者，當不僅為駐在印度希臘義大利三處之英軍。英國外駐軍力，除分佈前述三處外，尚有德國，巴勒斯坦及中東其他各處。外部已否認駐德之英軍即將撤退，而就巴勒斯坦之現狀觀，爲維持安全起見，英軍一時亦不致撤退。觀察家相信，若艾德禮之預定計劃如期付諸實行，則必係因為確信巴勒斯坦問題今秋可望在聯合國機構中獲得和平解決，而彼時德境之局勢，當亦已不需鉅額英軍之駐在矣。</p>

<h3>新成警局辦公室槍聲　警官受辱自殺　潘連璧因妻犯罪牽累　怨恨出手槍飮彈殞命　家屬指警局措置失當將依法起訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新成警察分局第一股辦公室內，昨晨四時二十分，發生一自殺案件，死者爲南市蓬萊警察分局第三股股長潘連壁，（見圖）年五十四，天津人，服務警界已二十餘年。其死因殊爲曲折，一般警界　人對此英不深致悼惜。潘於敵偽時期，曾與吳紹澍聯絡，担任地下工作，故於勝利後，吳曾贈與四寸小手槍一支，留作記念。執料潘於昨晨自殺時，即以此槍畢命也。</p>
<p>潘自殺之因，由於其要吸食雅片，而爲人所密告，致憤而出此。潘供職南市蓬萊警局，而其寓所在成都路二十一弄十號，故歸新成警周所管轄。此事經過情形，初爲新成警局接獲一匿名信，密告潘連　夫婦有吸毒行爲，當於前晚九時四十五分，由第一股股長呂同華派員警四名前往搜查，當時潘已入睡，其妻王氏因素有胃疾，正在亭子　內吸食雅片，　成警員以人證俱獲，堅欲將兩人帶入警局，潘以吸烟係其妻王氏，商請僅將其妻帶局訊問，被則不肯同往，員警不允所請，相持達一小時，並命加捺指印，堅欲一併帶局，潘至此憤然日：「好，和你們一道去，不過請稍候一下，我換衣服。」潘此時即懷死念，將手槍密藏身上，迨帶入新成分局後，即將潘王氏收押，將潘連璧安置於第一股辦公室中，潘此時獨對孤燈，愈想愈恨，至昨晨四時三十分，毅然拔出手槍自殺，對準太陽穴砰然一聲，人即隨聲倒地，彈自右太陽穴進，登時血流如注。肇事後該分局急將潘車送警察醫院治療，延至昨日下午五時半不治身死，彈仍留於腦壳內，未曾取出，昨晚十時已將屍體移送常德路騐屍所。</p>
<p>家屬表示　措置失當</p>
<p>按潘服務本市警界二十餘年，待人接物，和藹可親，身後頗爲蕭條，遺屬有妻妾三人，養女三人，無子。出事以後，記者曾走訪家屬，據稱：（一）警察搜查住宅，應會同保甲長前往，該分局並未如此辦理。（二）潘係公務人員，決無逃亡之虞，何必逼其擦指印，含有侮辱行爲，實爲促其自殺之原因。（三）若認爲潘有犯罪行爲，則應將潘帶局後加以搜查，潘身懷手槍而竟不知，認為係該分局之疏忽。（四）吸毒者係潘王氏，潘連璧之罪不過藏匿人犯而已，情節輕微，無立即帶局之必要，故謂此事不能不認為該分局措置之失當，聞潘之家屬將對該分局依法提起訴訟</p>

<h3>臨朐奏捷</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南特派員麗天訊〕「揭開大反攻的序幕」後不過半個月，也就在這火樣的七月最末一個星期，（廿四日起），陳毅以其七個嚴隊十五萬大軍，開始向書中交通鎗匯的臨朐城作本年，山東戰塲的最大一次「反攻」，戰火便也正如這火樣的七月在熾盛地展開了。</p>
<p>臨朐是位於彌河上游西岸的一個小城，河經城北二里許復有一支流來會，有公路南通沂水臨沂，北達益都壽光羊角溝，除魯北物資兵員多經此事遠山區外，由旅大渡渤海南遷之某方接濟，亦有一部在羊角溝起卸後，由陸路經臨朐運入山區。故臨朐實爲魯中共匪交通總臘。本年七月初騙軍奮一讓次入，旋即放棄。七男會二　濺軍再實攻佔很，以原有誠江，早經國軍於佔據時澈底破　，加以　的面積尙不及泰安之半。</p>
<p>李彌將軍</p>
<p>率所都六個團於入城後除淸掃共匪安撫流亡外，首先興修工事重築城垣，終因時間短促。卅六小時又能有多大作爲？因此，除已完成了若干必要的野戰工事外，所謂永久性工事，事實上是無暇及此。　廿四日夜九時起，匪軍先以五個縱隊及地方團隊一部不顧一切犧牲，分向四關猛撲，其間尤以對北關及城東一公里足可俯瞰全城之朐山攻擊爲最烈，然全城將士，在李彌將軍指揮下，皆能視死如歸，有進無退，城垣因此，賴以確保，至廿八日拂曉起，共匪復增兵兩縱隊，共計爲快速縱驗及第二·六·七·九·三·五·等六個共七個縱隊，除以第三縱隊駐三岔口爲總預備隊並阻遏南麻方面國軍北上外，其餘六個縱隊，俱加入攻擊，尤以快速縱臘之重砲　　等重武器不斷向城內遽鑲薑華，城內房會，大部　熾，北　被匪突入千餘，石　長建中逼負三傷，惟仍裏創殺敵，不稍後退，營長侯錫進，周毓寬在團長感召下，亦皆</p>
<p>負傷不退</p>
<p>因此三軍用命，士氣丕振，於下午四時許卒將突入城內殘匪全部殲滅。最高當局聞訊，特手令頒發撫卹費三億元命由王耀武轉發，廿八日夜，共匪復加强攻勢，城東西兩面，俱被匪三度突入，皆經擊退。廿九日晨起天忽陰暗大雨如注，共匪乃利用國空軍活動困難，復全力來攻，激戰至晚，除城東朐山及城南一角仍在國軍困守中外，其餘全入共匪之手。此時城內國軍，苦撐已達五裏夜，內無糧彈，外無救兵，戰事至此，實巳至最危急關頭，終賴李彌將軍指揮若定，沉着作戰，同時空軍　最惡劣氣候，下分昼夜，予頭匪以轟炸，予守軍以補給，彈被米麵之外，並允守軍要求，由濟南運往大量　　和　　，卒　過最後離開，於卅日首將東西兩門之匪擊退，卅一日由南廨悅莊北上，昌樂　縣南下之</p>
<p>兩路大軍</p>
<p>首先抵達城東八公里牧虎山尼姑山，城西十公里上下五井之綫，予攻城匪軍以反包園，共匪初尚掙扎，至卅一下午五時，以國軍包圍圈愈縮愈小，加以城內守軍，以接應部隊到達，愈戰愈奮，首解城東朐山之圍，各路匪軍見大勢已去，始分三路一路一個半縱隊突圍向東南柳山寨蔣峪方面逃竄，一路一個半縱隊突圍向西北朱崖方面逃竄，其主力約四個縱隊則向北面益都方面潰竄，其中原竄據北門之一個師因得令較遲，被國軍殲滅大半，匪軍師長及所部千餘於另一路逃匪折回救援併死掙扎後始獲突圍竄去。至一日下午，國軍追擊部隊已泊益都柳山寨，匪主力復逃向膠濟路北之桓台高桓一帶。國軍淸掃戰傷時，發現匪遺屍即達九千餘具，傷兵五千餘名，連同後運之傷斃官兵，合計八日來匪之傷亡</p>
<p>至少四萬</p>
<p>餘人，彌河個之　流，河水　爲之赤。而國軍傷亡，共僅兩個國零一　營，造成四平街大搜後的最大勝利。這個勝利不僅消滅了魯距若干「戰力」確保了國軍過去已得的勝利，穩住了昌灘，（李彌部爲昌　區國軍之精銳，如臨朐不守，李部被「吃」，昌　勢必無法固守，則對魯中甚至整個　周，影響之　，不難想見。）並且消滅了魯匪的〔戰志」，雖然陳毅已在膠實將若十地方團隊再度改編爲十個獨立旅，企圖在靑紗　起後（八月下半月）重整旗鼓作最後一　，但魯共主力（無論是陳　的或劉伯誠的）經火樣七月的各個大小戰役後，顯已面臨德崩潰前夕，則為無法否定的事實。而隨着八月俱來的，（除非魯共自東北或冀晉再增兵）至少在膠濟路以南，共匪除了倣效過去的蘇北，分成若干小股，從事流竄生涯外，對魯局甚至國內全局，日不能發生若何決定性的影響，這又爲眾所週知的事實。（一日）</p>

<p>吳市長國楨，對本市食油供應問題，極表關切。特於昨日下午四時半，在市府市長辦公室，召見中植油廠負責人張德成等，垂詢一切。張等除對食油供應，及價格等問題，詳加報告外，並報告稱，該廠前以民食調配委員會，爲普遍供應配油起見，曾撥借該會實油七千擔，因此在上月十二日起將經常配售暫時停頓，嗣又恐食油市價波動，爲抑平市價計，又於本月一日至六日，絡續向市塲拋售菜油二千五百六十七擔，現民食調配委會配油工作，已決定僅以產業工人為對黎，所撥借之七千擔已可歸還，故中植油廠，不日當可恢復零售油店六百家辦理食油之配售矣。</p>
<p>最後，張等又分析油價上昇之原因，略謂：油價波動，大半由於華南走私猖獗，靑島產地生油每撥爲八十萬元，運滬後另加水脚五萬元，計八十五萬元，而華南價格更昂，故走私之風特盛。另一原因，則爲黃豆雖已見新，但爲數不多，存貨又少，供求不能平衡，民營油廠，均已紛紛購買菜籽，改榨菜油，故生油雖告供不應求，今後菜油之供應，可望無聲匱乏云。</p>
<h3>套利息價激降　華股不脫盤局</h3>
<p>華股昨以塲外大戶翻多，息價開低至一角二及一角六分半，銀根鬆濫，套利甚賤，買無漸蘇。中途雖尚現不利，但開收時之情况却極兄穩。永紗等熱股已見反動，雜股則示甚樂觀，大勢尚屬盤檔。</p>
<p>晨開以陽前國行交換差出甚巨，且聞津證交亦將開業，人心見好而開高聲。舉永紗晨開一三五元，開後一三三號一八六號二三五號八九號一六〇號一二號俱進，一四號二一一五號則進現永紗，而盤上至二三一元。九七號二三五號賣出現永紗，二二四號二二三號趁高亦有了結，迫低至晨開價左右。</p>
<p>十時後，經二〇七號一二號一五七號之補進，二二五號二三〇號亦納即交永紗，漸漸回定。惟次熱股均未見利，華豐搪瓷在二二〇號與業銀行之大量傾售下，更貝不利。延至十時半後，聞銀行帮在塲外力納，塲內由二三一號一一六號二〇七號吸收，九五號一一六號一三〇號再進現永紗，遞水紗曾扳高至二三四元。二一一三號進後即出，二一八號二三五號一〇三號一五五號亦有供售，一四七號二三五號九七號仍售現水紗，而再迫低至二二七元。美亞重又破入四百元大關，終以亭　居多，抬價力彈，一一六號一二五號再吸，三二號一三〇號並納現永紗，臨收時各熱股咸呈小康之局。永紗升爲二二七元及二三一元結束。</p>
<p>收後喊價較低，遞永紗退至二三〇元光景，結果較前收即交股計華豐小挫，新華跌半成，永公信和美亞新光永紗中法微升，景福勤興尚平，新亞跌一成弱，國貨水泥大通麗安平平，中紡統益中絲榮豐徵升，內衣景綸火柴微降。遞交股計華豐平，美亞微升，永紗新光永公景福俱漲半成弱，傷外各老股尚稱平定。</p>
<p>現遞套利交易，昨銀行帮仍多貼進，交易不多，息價不過六分强以迄一角一左右。其中永紗貼價自六元半退至五元二結束，美亞高價十二元，低價一〇元五，而以十一元收市。新光自三元升至四元半，而以四元結束。華豐自二元半降至二結束。</p>
<h3>統債回漲　外肥平庸</h3>
<p>公債昨亦告回漲，成交亦增至七百萬左右。統丙農開一〇九〇〇元，三六〇室出後覆進，五五二室二三〇室雖出，五五〇室五〇三室均進，即告扶搖直上，步漲到一一九〇〇元後稍定，甲乙亦自七四〇〇元拉上至八〇〇〇元結束，較前收計甲乙戊各升七〇〇元，統丙回漲一〇〇〇元，統丁亦好起六〇〇元。</p>
<p>外股昨過程平庸，怡紗亦不過二千元上落，廣帮進怡紗，洋商則出，證券帮進英聯，而由銀行帮所賣，毛絨亦由銀行所供給，怡紗晨開八六五〇〇元，低至八四五〇〇，而後回升至八六〇〇〇元結束。較之前收計會德豐航業徵升，紙業怡啤尚平，怡紗英聯業慶鋼業微挫，而電話則跌落半成不到。</p>
<h3>食米消化呆滯　粳秈繼續下挫</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧六千三百石左右，消化仍呆，市勢一蹶不振，粳米及早薄稻均見步跌萬餘元，新粳來貨漸湧，猛挫萬餘元，中次跌進四十大關，白元陰元一致猛跌一二萬元，秈米苦無受主，鄉肖絕跡續跌一二萬元。</p>
<p>麵粉萎靡之勢，微挫千元，麩皮實銷淸懈。再疲三五百元。夏餅鄉銷已成落零。時屈新秋，肥料行將終止，外埠台灣略見間津，但成交寥寥，市面平庸。黃豆到銷　換，形勢定局，菉豆不脫疲境，逐步修俏，川鄒浙東均有新菉到申，後形仍難看好。赤豆挻立，元麥隨到隨銷，暫少榮辱。苞米北洋重見活躍，再淵萬元。紅糧納戶見淡，價疲三五千元。芝蔴去胃仍懈，翰　來貨不斷，趨勢下游。生仁華南續辦，挺進萬元。蠶豆客帮本街略動，依然穩定。英豆足仍無變化，小麥廠方做開，仍爲十四萬八千元，中次標準仍以水份泥灰多寫爲規推。</p>
<p>油市廣帮進意轉懈，本街亦無大量納胃，僅零化略交，各油一致回跌一二萬元。</p>
<h3>香港正和銀行　倒閉原因</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港七日電〕繼正和銀行六日　突告停業消息停出後，一般與銀行有關者咸表驚　。奪該行於去年開業，業務以　營兩洋僑　為大業，關於該行停業原因，據關係方面透露如次：（一）兩月前該行低價售出大量國幣而此種國和幣多係外埠僑匯，最近團幣回昇，而該行所收之衙匯又須到期繳付。與該行有關之遠洋貿易公司最近虧累過鉅。（三）自遠洋公司暹汕分公司倒閉後，存戶紛紛提款，（四）該行開業耗資即達港幣卅萬元，佔實收股（百萬元）百分之二十。（五）該行營業方針採單獨發展，與各銀行絕無關聯，故孤立無援。又該行債極人現已舉行會議，商討如何追償損失</p>
<h3>紡調小組會昨開會　核减細支紗議價　較上次規定價格小二十萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會議價小組會，於昨日下午四時許，召開會議，到委員多人，由榮爾仁代主席。討論經過，以連日紗價疲軟，原訂議價，已嫌過高，重行議訂結果，十支紗六八二萬元，十六支紗八六二元，以上議價照舊未動。廿支紗九六〇萬元，卅二支紗一二八〇萬元，四十支紗一四四〇萬元，均較上次議價小廿萬元。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕據關係士表示：日來糖紗市况，細支紗市價低於議價，實係紡建公司儘量配售，有以致之。廿支以下各紗產量，以民營廠居多。日來以配售不暢，致粗支紗市價，高於議價。故甚望民營廠應遵約同樣配售，俾共同合作抑平紗價云。</p>
<h3>粗紗略見回昂</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，最開尚呈平庸，旋以廣帮略有零星去胃，本街染廠織對二十支以下紗有吸納，迨至最後，市勢回秀，結果四二支雙股藍鳳細紗比上日續跌五萬，爲一千六百六十五萬元。寶光水月及四十支吉象寶光，三二支雙股豐年等細紗，均較上日步降三五萬至十萬元左右。二十支特雙馬則較上日回漲十萬元，爲一千二百二十萬。轉變屬亦升十五萬，爲一千零四十五萬元。其蝕人鐘金城紅　天婦女雙喜，及十六支光明三明天婦女海龍，十支　子車金寶星六支大聖等糧紗，一致回昂，自十萬元至十十餘萬元不一。</p>
<h3>棉布猶無起色</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市勢依然疲憊無神，客帮仍乏進取，本街祇有零碎添補。迨至收市，十二磅龍頭細布步低至四十一萬九千元，比上日續跌四千元。五福藍鷄彩球陽鶴等各檔，亦均步降二三千至六七千元。其他白坯漂布粗布及嗶幾元布等市，亦形不振。士林布桃花女及白貓花布，廠盤略予减低。</p>
<p>又訊：中國紡建公司昨晶循例售布，共售二二〇〇疋，申購單共七三張。內廠商二戶，購布二四〇疋。布號七一張，購布一九六〇疋。白坯掛牌仍爲五棉B字細布一種，價减低至三十六萬二午元，跳鯉哩嘰四十二萬元。並聞該公司於本月內，將有大批布疋運往華南銷售云。</p>
<h3>八月份民用配煤　總額五千噸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕燃管會八月份對民用煤之供量，總額仍定爲五千噸。配價或將參照實際成本，酌予調整云。</p>
<h3>社局擬商請國行　恢復火油原有限額　第三季核减為二百萬美元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市於四五月間，火油曾一度發生恐慌，奸商囤積居奇，市民無處購買。且因不法商人於火油中滲汽油，以致火災迭起，當時問題雖極嚴東，而實際供求尚屬平衡，經肚會局公用局消防處，會同作適當處置後，即告平息。惟第二季進口時值夏令，火油消耗量較少，至第三季轉入秋冬，火油需用漸大，社會局會函請臨時輸入管理委員會增加外匯。</p>
<p>今因報載第三季火油限額核减爲二百萬美元，較第二季三百三十萬美元反减少百分之三十人，如此火油恐慌勢必重現，實際供應不足，欲求穩定市面，殊爲困鄭。而人造火油質劣，且由柴油提取，則柴油將復入黑市，徒供奸商圖利。</p>
<p>社會局有鋻於此，擬計中央銀行准予恢復火油原有限額，以安定市面。據有關方面表示，恢復原有進口限額可無問題，本市火油供應不致有虞。</p>
<h3>反對人絲提高配價　絲織業開小組會議　靜待政院經部等機關批示</h3>
<p>絲織業反對中信局提高人造絲配價推派代表先後向市政府社會局請願後，已引起各方注意。昨據該會消息，杭州，蘇州等地絲織業，亦均巳推派代表蒞滬，於昨日午後與本市代表開小組會議，檢討對策。決定繼續向各方爭取减低配價，否則全市四百餘家絲識工廠，曁蘇杭同業，均不惜停業以反抗，目前正靜待行政院經濟部等各機關之批示。又據關係方面透露：當局對人造絲今復配售辦法，現正在審愼計議澈底辦法中，可能方照管制棉紗辦法，即當局以人造絲交給絲織廠代織綢緞，迨織成後全數交給中信局銷售，以防免廠商體斷居奇之流弊云。</p>
<p>人絲盤旋　廠經平穩</p>
<p>人造絲昨市呈盤旋，一二〇號高山有光，上午二千四百八十萬元開盤，收盤二千四百五十萬元賣出低。下午又告回升，最後四百九十萬元成交價，結果比上日降三十萬元。</p>
<p>廠經昨市行情仍平穩，交易極稀少。C字等級討價二千九百二十萬元，D字等級喊價八百八十萬元。干經喊價與昨日相同。綢貨因有大戶吸收及軋空關係，開市後即告上升。</p>
<h3>中信局處理敵產　總值逾九千億元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中央信託局息：該局處理敵偽產業數值，迄本年七月底爲止，總額已在九千億元以上。該局會奉行政院令，按月處理敵偽產業五百億元。惟近月來處理數值，每月恒在一千億元左右云。</p>
<h3>榕貿易出超　七月份近八十億</h3>
<p>〔本報福州七日電〕榕七月份貿易，據統計，出口貨二九四億除，進口貨二一五億元，出超七十九億餘元。出口貨幾全爲特產，木材出口一七二億元，茶三十一億，紙廿七億，屬示木材外價有起色。</p>
<h3>台糖市勢復疲</h3>
<p>昨台糖市勢復趨　勸，而本期所記者全數均爲中砂白，兼之去化仍未　旺，是爲不易過好之主因。公會　盤，二〇中砂白五十五萬元，台赤五十五萬五千元。俱小萬餘元。四半白草包貨六十八萬元，油提靑四十二三萬元，交易甚　。興化白五十七八萬元，興赤四十二萬元，計二三百簍。海南赤五十簍，四十二萬五千元，刁靑五十包，三十四萬元。</p>
<h3>茶市黯澹</h3>
<p>各種內銷茶，自本街及客帮連缐拖吸以來，刻下因需額暫告足够　致活動之意，較形遜落。但人心尚佳，過程遂呈呆穩之狀。至於洋莊茶市。交易更無起色。而其趨勢，因貨主守意殊堅，遂仍平靜不樂。</p>
<h3>英美烟步昂</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，初開人心即見堅俏，塲內交易以英美烟走勢較暢，市氣亦秀。最後以需求殷切，十支大英牌烟高至九百七十六萬元，比上日回漲二三萬元。老刀牌烟亦升十二萬元爲七百五十五萬元。五華哈極關價亦跟升數萬。</p>
<p>華商烟銷路較旺之白蘭地克雷斯紅金紅人等條烟，軋升二三百至五六百元。美麗金顧全祿變斧等牌平穩，美貨駱駝樂更馬力斯等烟無甚上落。聽頭烟茄力克三五水主義牌，因貨稀回升五百至一平元。</p>
<h3>現棉產旺</h3>
<p>昨日現棉交易活絡，因前日紡建開價收購，同業因有老交易關係，均多出售，惟開價不高，靈寶最高價爲二一五萬，客戶以紡建開價較民營廠反低，人心軟弱不敢扳價，故銀根緊急者，亦告脫手，同業紛起抵補，市上賣買均旺。各檔做開靈寶二一二萬，二一三萬，二一四萬一二一五萬，二一七萬五千。漢細一九五萬，二〇二萬，二〇三萬。沙市二〇六萬五千，老河口二〇〇〇萬，山東脫力司二一〇萬。浦東火機一七二萬五千，周浦籽花每組三一萬五千。</p>
<p>又訊：招商局蔡鍔輪，昨日駛靑津，裝去大批洋棉花，計靑島五百件，天津六千四百餘件，恐略有退開，此棉係中紡報運。</p>
<h3>木材市况</h3>
<p>洋松零星配花色，站在八千元，若大批交易，市價已破八千元。衫不大條價在二千五百元，柳安夾板市况更疲，有五萬五千元成立交。</p>

<h3>父新</h3>
<p>— Bjornstjerne　Bjornson著　曹國平譯</p>
<p>人家都是說這個人在敎區中是挺有錢和挺有勢的人；他的名字呌桑德，渥凡拉斯。一天他在牧師書房中是一個身材魁偉而辦事有熱忱的人。</p>
<p>他說：『我有一個兒子，我希望給他受洗禮』</p>
<p>『他希望呌什麼』？</p>
<p>『Finn—依我的父親』。</p>
<p>『敎父和敎母呢』？</p>
<p>『他們都是桑德的親戚，都是一致公認及證明爲敎區中最好的男子和女子』。</p>
<p>『沒有別的了吧』？牧師詰問着，同時盼顧着四周。這農夫（桑德）有點躊躇，最後便開口：</p>
<p>『我十分喜歡讓他自己行洗禮』。</p>
<p>『那末在週日期吧』？</p>
<p>『下星期六中午十二時正』。</p>
<p>『還有什麼別的嗎』？牧師又問了一遍。</p>
<p>『沒有別的了』。　這農夫扭動他手中的帽子似乎要走了。牧師便站了起來。</p>
<p>『好吧』！牧師說着一面向桑德面前走去；握着他的手，以嚴重的眼光望着他說：</p>
<p>『上帝賜給你這孩子，他是你的唯一的幸福』。</p>
<p>十六年後的一天，桑德重臨那收師的书房。</p>
<p>『眞的，你的年歲過得很快樂的，桑德』！牧師驚奇而喜悅地說，因爲他一點也沒有改變舊容。</p>
<p>『這是爲了我沒有憂愁』。桑德回答？</p>
<p>牧師默然不语，隔了片刻他發問着：『今天晚上你怎又是這麼高興』？</p>
<p>『我的所以來是爲了我的兒子他明天將正式行按手洗禮了』。</p>
<p>『他是一個肖明的孩子』</p>
<p>『在我沒有聽到他明天在敎堂中應得的位子號數前，我不希望他被准許入敎』。</p>
<p>『他將得到第一位』。牧師說：</p>
<p>『我聽到了。這裏有十塊錢給你』。桑德說。</p>
<p>『我還有別的事要爲你做嗎一？牧師凝視着桑德說。</p>
<p>『沒有別的』。</p>
<p>桑德出去了。</p>
<p>八年像流水地滾過去。一天在牧師會房外有喧嘩的聲音，是有許多人要進去，桑德他是首腦第一個進去。</p>
<p>我牧師顧着他們同時向桑德致敬。</p>
<p>『你來出席這晚会？桑德』。</p>
<p>『我到這裏來是请求你把那宣佈的結婚期的柬簡可以爲我的兒子發印着，他將要和凱倫，斯多立頓結婚。她是裘德孟的女兒，他現在就站在我旁邊』。</p>
<p>『喔，她在這敎區中是最有錢的女孩子』</p>
<p>『他們是如此說的……」農夫回答着，用一隻手撫摸着他後邊的领髪。</p>
<p>这牧師靜站着一會似乎在深思着，不久他毫無任何評論便將這兩人的姓名錄入薄上，在下面簽着這些人的自己的姓名。</p>
<p>桑德把三塊錢放在桌子上。</p>
<p>『我祇要一塊錢』。牧師說</p>
<p>『我很明白這點，但他是我唯一的獨生子，我要辦得關綽大方些』</p>
<p>牧师取了</p>
<p>『桑德，現在這是第三次你到這裏爲了你兒子的事』。</p>
<p>『但是現今我是给他辦妥了他的終身問題』。桑德摺擺他的袖珍書向牧師辭別。</p>
<p>那些人們便跟隨桑德慢慢地走出去了，</p>
<p>兩星期後，父親和兒子在湖中蕩舟，這是一個寗靜而平穩的日子。他們到斯多立頓家去商酌及計劃結婚的事，</p>
<p>『這橫置的船舷板不很總當』兒子說着，於是站了起擺平這板。</p>
<p>不久他正坐着的船舷震動得在下面潛動，他伸出了想握物的手，高呼了一聲便跌在船外。</p>
<p>『緊握着　子』！父親狂喊，跳近他的身旁，投出了槳。</p>
<p>他兒子三次努力未遂，使他漸漸蘇惶了。</p>
<p>『等一會』，父親喊着，同時竭力把船搖近他兒子。</p>
<p>於是兒子用力地掙扎在水面上，到底他望了望父親沉下水</p>
<p>桑德幾乎不能相信他兒子的溺水；他執着船桿，　視着他兒子下沉的一點，似乎他的兒子要再浮到水面。水面升起了些泡沫，漸漸地增加，最後一個挺大的裂破；湖波重歸平滑寗靜像鏡子一樣。</p>
<p>三日三夜人民看到父親在出事地點迴旋地搖着，是廢食忘寢；他在撈這湖水爲要得到他兒子的屍體。在第三天早晨，他找着，抱着他懷中帶到他自己的家園的山上。</p>
<p>在這事一年之後，一個晚秋的薄暮時分，當牧師聽到幾個人在門外的走廊中很留心在尋找什麼。牧師開了門，走進了一個高長而消瘦的人，屈曲的身體，蒼白的頭髪，這牧師在能認識他以前，會仔細地相了他的臉好久。</p>
<p>這是桑德！</p>
<p>『你怎樣的遲還在走呢』？牧師在他面前說。</p>
<p>『驪，是，這是賺了」。離禮說着一面取了一雙褲子着。牧師也坐下，好像在等待什麼，沉默了許久。</p>
<p>最後桑德說；</p>
<p>『我身邊有些東西，我願意送給貧窮的人，這是我兒子的一一份遺產，我希望是投資生于利』。</p>
<p>他站起來，把錢放在桌上，然後重又坐下。</p>
<p>『這是一筆鉅款』。他說。</p>
<p>『這是我田地的一半的價錢，我今天已買去的了』。</p>
<p>牧師默默地靜坐好久，最後他問着；</p>
<p>『桑德，現在你有什麼企圖去做』？</p>
<p>『有更好的』。</p>
<p>他們相對地望着片刻，桑德垂下的眼睛被牧師釘視着。立刻牧師溫和地說：</p>
<p>『我以爲你的兒子最後已帶給了你眞正的幸福』。</p>
<p>『黝的，我也以為然』。桑德說着，望着四周，兩顆圓大的淚珠慢慢地從他頰上淌下來。</p>

<h3>父親節有感</h3>
<p>— 張一渠</p>
<p>民三十四，予與組慮慶，袁希濂，陳靑士，梅蘭芳，史致富，陸幹臣，嚴獨鶴，費穆，富文壽羅君子，聯名發起八八父親節，滿望報德尊親，消弭戰禍，不圖外患初平，內亂又起，人倫汨沒，物慾橫行，蒿目時艱，詩難盡意。</p>
<p>八戲銀河洗敵，蕭牆難洗淚痕新，</p>
<p>干戈玉帛迢遙夢，禽獸衣冠隱約鄰；</p>
<p>千里懷鄕長戚威，百年建國始親親，</p>
<p>秋來爲語諸丹桂，佳節同歌不老椿。</p>
<h3>爸爸</h3>
<p>— 蓮子</p>
<p>今天是父親節，也是立秋日，遙想今日下午立科時分，爸爸一定在興高彩烈地爲第妹們分西瓜，並且我相信在這時他定能想到這正在此地懷念着他的女兒的。八年抗戰的流亡生活，使我們弎夠了，為了要完成爸爸守節的弎心，我和大姐用二個女孩子微弱的力量艱難地支撐了這個家，別說吃瓜解署了，最窮的時候我們連飯都沒有吃，但是我總沒有忘記在立秋日爲爸爸買回一隻西瓜，即使只小小的一隻，我知道爸爸不會忘却我家數代的老例—立秋日全家吃一點西瓜！我不忍望着爸爸在這一年僅有的一個節日，爲了沒有一片西瓜來憤例地分給他的孩子們而感到難受。</p>
<p>曾記得有一天，爸爸自外面歸來，臉上的愁思更濃重了，他極力地迴避我詢問的目光，但是最後終於帶着顫動的聲音，悄悄地對我說：「孩子！外面傳說你的二哥陣亡了。我不敢把這個消息聲張出來，怕把你的祖母及母親急懷，因爲在我們這個貧困的家庭裏，再也不能…………」。我給這驚人的消息嚇呆了，但當我看到爸爸愁苦的臉色，我却忍着淚安慰地說：「爸爸！我想我們不能輕易相信流言，恐怕有人故意造謠」爸爸緊握着我的雙手，似信非信地點了點頭，可是，從此蘊藏在爸爸胸中的焦慮，却使他的身體更形消瘦弱。</p>
<p>戰事日延一日，我們的苦難更深了，六月十二日——這也永銘心頭的一天——家裏沒有一粒米，袋裏沒有一個錢，「用什麼來做飯呢」？母親焦慮的說。我東找西尋，突然發現半筒做麵用的酵粉，我欣喜得驚呌起來，我說。「媽！我們用它來做餅子吃罷」！媽及大姐四弟等都知道這不是良好的食物，但是除此之外，我們有什蠻更好的食糧呢？只是想到祖母年老了，她怎能吞下這粗糙的食物？爸爸臥病已二天子，他怎能吃這又酸又硬的餅呢？驚然，我想到衣袋裏還有兩顆同事送給我的糖，本來我預備帶回給病中，的爸爸吃的，於是我敲碎了這兩顆糖，分包在兩個餅子中，烘得輭頓的。給祖母和爸爸，祖母不忍獨吃，分了一半給正在望着熱餅的小弟弟。不知道爸爸因爲肚子餓了，還是久未嘗到甜味？吃完後他說還要吃一個。可是找怎麼能再做一個甜餅呢，小弟弟也不知道是爲了要討爸爸的歡　，還是他以爲餅子都是甜的？偷偸地拿一個餅子去給爸爸，爸爸咬了一口酸硬的餅，他明白了、當我們和媽正在商酌怎樣再做一個甜餅時，爸爸來了，他看見　上的二張包糖的紙，更洞悉一切。他含着淚沉痛地說：「貧窮能奪去我一切的享受，但它奪不了我兒女對我的孝心；世界上什麼華貴的筵席，會比這隻甜餅更美味呢」？爸爸喜悅而辛酸的話激動了我們，摧下了我的淚，我想避過我的臉不讓他看見掛着的淚珠，但一陣心慌，我正在按餅的手，沒有按着餅而按在灼熱的鍋子上燙出泡來了。爸爸愛憐橫溢地拉過我的手，找了一點藥物細心地給我包紥着，浴在爸爸的慈祥與熱愛裏，我掛着淚的臉上又現出了笑容，大家也都給我悲喜無定的樣子逗出了笑聲。我們就在這忽哭忽笑的情緒中結束了這餐世界上最簡陋也最豐盛的午餐。</p>
<p>勝利的消息傳來是這麼的突兀，使我們驚喜得要窒息了，爸爸在歡愉裏沒有忘記二哥，在他開朗的臉上依然輕輕地蒙着一層憂　的陰影。</p>
<p>那天，當我們正在　商怎樣回到破碎的家園時，（因爲鄉下親戚來信，說我們的房子並未完全焚毀）綠衣人從門縫裏塞進一封信來，我趕快跑去拿起來，當一我在這風塵僕僕的信封上，看到一寄信人的姓名時，我不禁雀躍起來「啊！爸爸！這是二哥的來信呢』歡悅的淚珠使我的視綫糢糊了，爸爸用抖動着的手拆開了信力地讀着二哥的來信，彷彿神聖　牧師，在宣讀莊嚴的聖經。把　在屋隅的老祖母，也聽得坐立不安地，高興得笑得哭了！在最後一張信紙上，還黏着一張匯票，錢他解決了我們的回鄕問題。</p>
<p>僱了一條船，搬上了我們簡單而破碎的行李什物，吿別了七年來相依爲命的屋子，懷着輕快的心情，回到家鄕的故園，八年前種下的小樹都長得着翠宜人，他們隨風搖曳地像在錢迎這闊別八年的主人安然歸來。爸爸立在花台畔野草裏，在扶持一株他以前深愛而現在仍還衰老地活着的菊花，看着飄散在西風中的爸爸的白髮，我想起以前的壯健的父親，八年離亂的生活。不但增添了他的衰頹，更加深了他心靈上的蒼老！正像這株傲霜的殘菊，埋沒在野草裏一樣！</p>
<p>今年陰曆元旦，是爸爸六十歲的生辰，我們都帶了禮物，回家賀壽，爲了寄人籬下的苦楚，我們在大雨傾盆的大年夜傍晚到家。祖母努力燃火，以便母親趕快製些點心給我們充飢驅寒，母親用力地切着肉，爸爸忽然想起什蠻似的到房裏去取了許多糖來分給我們，當我看淸這包糖的紙時，我佩服爸爸的記憶和我一樣的好，因爲我沒有忘却這做餅給爸爸吃的糖了並且箱子裏還藏着不少，預備送給爸爸做禮物呢，四弟也覺察了，我們撲倒在爸爸的懷裏，在他的愛撫下，流着喜悅的淚，直到媽喊我們吃點心的時候，才愛婦地離開了爸爸。</p>
<p>爸爸年靑時他把全副精力灌注在十個兒女的身上，但是，在十個兒女都已長成的今日，他又何曾事到一點兒女之福？想到此地我又不禁愧然了。</p>
<h3>父親節歌</h3>
<p>— 鍾如舟</p>
<p>向父親歌頌罷！</p>
<p>兒女們！</p>
<p>誰賦予我們生命的活力？</p>
<p>誰用堅壯的胳臂將我們扶起，</p>
<p>帶領我們追尋生活的眞諦？</p>
<p>向父親禮議罷！</p>
<p>兒女們！</p>
<p>父親的愛。</p>
<p>蘊藏在更深更遠的關懷裏，</p>
<p>他讓自已一點一滴的血汗，</p>
<p>釀成生命的甘醴，</p>
<p>滋潤着每一片我午生長的土地；</p>
<p>好敎我們的生命，</p>
<p>像陽光般燦爛，</p>
<p>比彩霞更絢麗。</p>
<p>向父親致敬羅！</p>
<p>兒女們！</p>
<p>他會用精神的鋼刀，　把歷史的生命</p>
<p>刻劃得鮮血淋漓；</p>
<p>用毫無埋怨的勞苦，</p>
<p>編織祖國的榮譽；</p>
<p>當我們長成時，</p>
<p>我們便承受了</p>
<p>這　功偉績。</p>
<p>向父親歡呼罷！</p>
<p>兒女們！</p>
<p>在今，</p>
<p>讓我們高　歷史的金杯，</p>
<p>慶祝我父親箱神的火炬</p>
<p>永不淚總。</p>
<h3>上海的毒瘤</h3>
<p>— 十郞</p>
<p>看過「日出」的人，都知這　裏有個不出塲的「金人」，他在幕帷背後發發施令，統率着他自己的「王國」。</p>
<p>上海這種人多得很，但也并不如你理想中鄕樣　專。因爲這些人稍懂文　。略請音律的時候，他們何嘗不可以附會風雅？</p>
<p>又如西門慶，是大家熟悉的人物，他會武塲，也會文塲，他可以與當權者往還，他也可以與地　土棍勾結。</p>
<p>所以英英士路一帶二百多商家控訴的「地　」，在上海人看來，也平已安之若泰了。</p>
<p>好像上海有一天存在。就應該有這　『電影」存在似的。</p>
<p>這正如如一個「飲鴆止渴」的人，有一天，他可以不　　藥　持他生合的時　，在他肉臉眞情神上，好個多了一個欠怏。</p>
<p>這種人正如生長在上海人身上的「　　」，太久了，也好像是應該有的。所以，英士路二百多商店的控訴，使我們有點奇突之感。</p>
<p>能不能把上海人身上的「毒瘤」用手術根本割　呢？這是一個絕症，要大夫病人痛下決心，才可以根本治療。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>介紹兩位女大使</h3>
<p>— 榮觀</p>
<p>潘鍬營夫人與柯倫泰夫人</p>
<p>自印臨時政府發表任命尼赫魯之妹潘狄特夫人爲印度首任駐蘇大使後，從此持節國外縱橫　閥的女大使，便不讓柯倫泰夫人專美於先了！</p>
<p>申報四日載倫敦廣播：「印度第一任駐蘇大使潘狄特夫人，三日搭機前往菲斯科。」如電訊所示：這亞洲第一位的女大使潘狄特夫人，她生於一八九九年，她比她的大哥尼赫魯小十歲，雖然可也是四十八歲的「老」婦人了！她有着一副「飽經風霜」的臉相‘花自的頭髮，中等身段。她與她哥哥及丈夫潘狄特先生一家從事印度獨立奮鬥的工作，並有過三次被捕下獄的紀綠。而潘狄特先生的生命就因為革命挫折磨難致死，但丈夫的母親還活着，現在也有九十多歲了。女兒名西雪里亞，這次是隨同赴蘇的。過去潘狄特天人曾主特過她的出生地阿拉哈巴德市的敎育工作，又當過全印婦女協會會長，也代表印度出席過聯合國大會。去年聯合國大會在舊金山會議的時候，她雖然以印度人民的資格參加，但她所作爲印度的自由與獨立等的呼籲和活動，却很贏得世人的同情。申報駐美特派員毛樹清先生在他的紐約骯訊中，並譽之爲二十餘位首席代表的演說中之最成功者。(見去年十一月三　十日申報）她的英文，每一個音節都非常清楚，雖然有一點印度士音夾雜其間，但是並不令人聽了討厭。最近她任聯合省衛生部部長。她在國內的聲譽，可媲美已故的英敎育部大臣惠爾金女士。以這樣位富有政治工作經騐的女性，來擔任首任印度駐蘇大使的新職，無疑可勝任愉快的。她的成功，不僅是印度人民的幸福，而且是全東亞婦女的榮光！</p>
<p>說到柯倫泰夫人，她的大名更為世人所熟悉：她是世界上第一位的女外交官，也是第一位派駐國外的女大使，她一八七二年生在俄羅斯一個富有的大地主家裏，丈夫亞力山大，柯倫泰是一個貴族，雖然她於十八歲就脫離頑固的家庭，而把自己的青春與生命獻給了婦女解放運動。她渡過廿餘年的流亡生活，她在德國進過大學，專攻經濟問題與婦女問題的研究。一九一七年她離開德國從事反帝運動，但不久就被政府逮捕，監禁在里黑暗的地獄裏。幸而不久，蘇聯十月革命拯救了她，她也開始被新政府所重用，担任敎育等方而的工作。一九二一年柯倫泰夫人被任命爲駐挪威大使兼通商代表。一九二六年調任爲駐墨西哥大使，一九三〇年七月調任爲駐瑞典的大使，一直到現在。柯倫泰夫人的確是了不起的人物，她是個多方面博學能幹的女性：她是外交家，敎育家，婦女問題專家，而又是天才的文學家。她有兩部被介紹到中國來的名著：是「赤戀」和「三代戀愛」。她認爲事業應重於戀愛，道或是她成功的原因。她對婦女問題更有豐富的著作，並被認爲婦女問題的理論權威。</p>
<h3>民校成績展覽</h3>
<p>— 方仁</p>
<p>市敎育局主辦的民校成績展覽會，業自五日起假膠州路實騐民校揭幕了。參加的單位，達一二〇個，展覽的房子，佔有十一室，參加的出品，計一一七七四件，不可謂不洋洋大觀了。</p>
<p>各單位的成績，大概不外三部份：一是行政方面的，如日誌表册之類；二是敎導方面的，如作業，試卷之類；三是推廣方　的，如購稿，　報之類。另外實騐民校因兼辦推廣區業務，有一　推廣區土地建築物模型，是很出色的。</p>
<p>這次參加展覽的成績，聽說已經請了許多位專家評判，似無庸多所置　。茲將記者於走馬看花之后，略抒觀感如次：</p>
<p>（一）各民校成績，發展方向殊不平均，有少數僅以學生作業與試卷充數，這未免單調些，實則學生的作業與試卷搜集甚易，行政與推廣成績，却受平時陸續紀戰，不能組製濫造，是雜能要貴的。</p>
<p>（二）展覽成績，似應以本身戰掌範圍以內爲限，若風馬牛無關者，則以省略爲是。如有一二絞以工廠出品的絲　。背帶·電珠·香烟·熱水瓶　之類爲出品，牽涉未免過廣，難免失却展覽會原來的性質。因爲民校並沒有勢作之類的功課的，且此種工業產品，亦非學校現有的設備所可以製作的；故似嫌多餘。</p>
<p>（三）統計圖表，以能表示數字的準確與比例的淸晰爲主，色彩的鮮艷與否，紙張的考究與否，工程的樓緻與否，則在其次。少數學校有忽前者而注重後者，似大可不必。</p>
<p>此外，關於布置方面的，如實騐民校因另劃出三室，顯得統一與調和；其餘各單位，則聯合陳列，有的成績不多，所佔面積甚大，有的成績也不少，却侷處一隅；又如圖表的大小，橫竪·高低·都任各自發展，對於統一與調和這一點，似未能顧及。</p>
<h3>法駕導引</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>普陀香客被綁，佗二億元出險—見八月個日本市新聞。</p>
<p>靈山上，靈山上，佛法號無邊，香客爭　新福壽，道塲水陸惹麻煩，艦命險交關，</p>
<p>多金客·多金客·旣富便思仙！那曉慈航偏吝渡，渡來渡去大王船，二億化寃錢！</p>
<p>旅美什錦　徐菽園　美國兵的抗戰夫人</p>
<p>抗戰夫人是「抗戰」的必然產物，抗戰夫人可稱爲眞性的與非眞性的，譬如說一個戰士在抗戰時娶了一位夫人，她當然是眞性的抗戰夫人，一個商人在後方述難娶了一位夫人，她便不能算是眞性的抗戰夫人，因爲她的丈夫根本不曾抗戰，僅是逃難避戰而已。美國抗戰夫人之多，可以打破世界紀錄，美軍出征歐洲及太平洋，無慮數百萬人，多數是未婚男子，到了英法，因爲風俗習慣的協調，加以軍中孤寂，而英法的男性又是那麼稀少，到了這一大批年靑力强的美國男子，自然成爲英法女子心目中的禁臠，一方是羅敷無夫，一方是使君無婦，自然一拍即合了。而且美國是世界婦女心目中的天堂，誰都願意嫁一個壯健的美國丈夫。和平之後，美軍從歐洲誒退，跟着便是一船一船的抗戰夫人和勝利兒童War　Brides　and　V-Babies每次在紐約上岸數以萬計，前後運了足有二年，纔把數十萬名抗戰夫人和勝利兒童連完。</p>
<p>英法人在此次戰爭中賠了夫人又折兵，美國人却不勞而獲了幾十萬優秀人民，這幾十萬新增的人口，當然也經過美兵苦幹出來的。美國女子對於這批新嫂嫂未免引起醋意，因爲她們奪去了美國小姐的未婚夫，但「已成事實」還有什蠻辦法呢？美籍華僑兵和駐華美軍，在中國也娶了不少抗戰夫人，這種嫁給美軍的中國小姐，包括舞女，交際化，吉普女郞，小家碧玉等，爲數亦頗可觀，現已分批由美國政府專輪護送到美國，最後一批約一百名在廣州集中，轉道香港，乘輪渡洋赴美。這一批華籍抗戰夫人多數不會說英語，所以沿途照料頗感費事，以前已有四百多人從上海啓程赴美，每次都派美國高級軍官領隊，並挑選翻譯官隨船照料，這些中國小姐生平未曾涉足國外，有些根本不曾離開過上海，對於美國新家庭生活，一無所知，護送人員在船上辦了一個英文識字班，每天教她們讀「歐皮西提」和說簡單的英語，船到了紐約以後，護送人員的責任尙未終了，還得分別送她們到美國各地的新家庭，辦理正式移交手續，大概百分之四十是在紐約唐人街，百分之四十是在舊金山唐人街，其餘散處美國各地，也有很多投機份子借着與美軍有一度春風的關係，胃充抗戰夫人而去美國的，所以美軍當局一定要查騐結婚證明文件，因此在某一個時期，曾忙於設法證明文件，這種證明文件比外交部的護照還値錢，因爲取得證明文件的人，不但可穩得美國國籍，還可免費安抵新大陸。（三）（八）</p>
<h3>豆棚閑話</h3>
<p>— 方無知</p>
<p>唐睢謂信陵君：「事有不可知者，有不可不知者；有不忘者，有不可不忘者。」</p>
<p>他的原意是指：對別人的懀惡我，不可以不知道；自己不滿意別人。却不能給人知道；人有恩於我。不可以忘却；我有恩於人。不可以不忘却。</p>
<p>在「厚黑哲學」翻印行銷的今天。事有可知者，有不可知者；有忘者，有不可忘者。</p>
<p>別人憎我，，裝聾作啞，不可知者；我之惡人，欲必置之死地，可知者；受恩於人，未必記得，有忘者；施恩於人，逢人便說，有不可忘者。</p>
<p>唐睢之言，「無忌謹受敎」者，其誰？</p>
<p>溫莎公爵，爲愛拋棄了王位，這是「戀愛無條件」諭者最得意的引證。但這些裏竟是過去的事。</p>
<p>有些女人把對方的地位，名望，錢財作爲條件，其實這條件祇是「出賣」的價格而已。</p>
<p>「紅顏白髮相映成趣」，正是戀愛市塲多次做開的或次成交。</p>
<h3>紀念華亭　（下）</h3>
<p>— 因</p>
<p>—殉難報人介紹之一</p>
<p>他能叫愛好孤獨的同事，在半推半就中，跟着他上街歸義；沉默寡言的朋友，在無可無不可中，爲他開話盒子。假定兩個人在屋子裏悶得發慌，他一到塲，那兩位朋友便像萎枯的野草，沾着朝露，雖不立刻滋長，却是蘇甦有望。</p>
<p>他好像友情之中的酵母，可以使一個包子，得着他的作用；高高的，鬆鬆的，蓬勃而富有生氣；更可以使一籠的饅頭，受着他的推動，熱氣蒸　，集體奮發。</p>
<p>因之，在任何最緊要的時間或塲合，憑着他三言兩語，就能使對方頑廉懦立；消極者變爲積極，坐着的起而行動。他不但能說，而且能做，無論　嚏·談笑·一舉手·一投足·都是他渾身活力的表現。</p>
<p>惟其如此，華亭嫉惡如仇，決不妥協，心之所惡，往往咬牙切齒，聲色俱厲，不但形之於色，簡直要訴之於力。了解他的人，固然無所謂，但是爲了他太率直，太缺乏含蓄，終於爲仇者所乘，這是非常可惜的。</p>
<p>和其他爲國殉難志士一樣，華亭生前不事生產，身後十分着條，妻子兒女扶養無人。五年前，他　了悲劇中的主角，怎道五知年之後，他所希望的國家勝利早經得到，而他的家庭直到現在，還是被陰雲愁霧籠單着；政府的褒揚，社會的崇敬，救不了要啼子號，打不破　寒氛園。他們連最簡單的生活和敎養費用，猶無着落。</p>
<p>在華亭遇難前數星期，有一天，他很感嘆的對琅　君說：「我子女幼小，萬一我遭不測，他們將如何生活」？還有一天，他」個人悶着坐在寫字桌旁，無端的在紙上橫七豎八，寫了數十個「家庭敎育」字樣。華亭天生樂觀，富有生活勇氣，平時不知湮鬱憂悶爲何物，這兩件事，可說是他　意職的內心表現，他當時的情緒，我們不難想像而得。</p>
<p>我們能否把華亭悲劇的幕幔還　地放下來，使他的兒女，一面浸沐在他們父親爲國　　的光榮裏，一面却避免做他們父親生膠所　慮的憂悶對象呢？</p>

<h3>Preliminary Conference on the Peace Treaty with Japan Set for September 10th; US Attempting to Reconcile Differing Views Among Nations</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, July 7th (Broadcast) – According to well-informed sources, the preliminary conference on the peace treaty with Japan has been set for September 10th to avoid conflicting with the dates of the United Nations General Assembly. If the Soviet Union continues to insist on its original proposal, the conference will be held without Soviet participation. It is reported that Britain and Australia have suggested that the initial talks be conducted by foreign ministers, a proposal to which the US has expressed agreement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, July 6th] – Marshall stated today that the United States has received replies from ten countries regarding the US invitation to convene a preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan. While the countries hold differing views on how to proceed, they all agree on the need for swift action. Marshall said at a press conference today that the United States has not yet responded to the suggestions made by various countries regarding future attendance at the conference. The US is seeking a way to reconcile these differing views. The US has not yet responded to the Soviet Union’s proposal to hold a foreign ministers' conference instead of a meeting of representatives from the eleven Far Eastern Commission countries. Marshall did not indicate when the meeting would be held, but it is widely believed that the originally scheduled date of August 19th has been postponed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, July 6th] – The New York Herald Tribune argued in an editorial for an early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, but stated that if the treaty prevents the completion of America's plans for Japan, then it would be better not to conclude one. The newspaper stated that the absence of a treaty has severely hindered efforts by MacArthur to revive Japanese industry and establish a solid economic foundation for the Japanese government. It said that the prospect of certain industrial sectors in Japan being used as reparations caused anxiety, making it nearly impossible to restart many factories. These factories, it said, could be given to China or the Philippines as reparations within one or two years. The newspaper further stated that there are many difficulties with the peace treaty, such as the Soviet Union's opposition to the US proposal to have the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission draft the treaty and decide by a two-thirds vote. The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet Union insists on Moscow's veto power over all treaty terms, seeking to achieve its consistent goal of controlling the East and expanding its influence. Commenting on China's suggestion that the treaty's decisions require the agreement of at least three of the most directly affected countries, the newspaper said that this suggestion clearly stems from the extreme fear among Chinese people of the resurgence of a strong Japan and the recurrence of another Sino-Japanese war.</p>
<h3>National Army Controls the Jiaoji Railway Line; Battle in Western Shandong Enters a Tense Climax; Mopping-Up Troops in Hebei Province Enter Xiong County</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Jinan, July 7th] – The National Army has taken control of the entire Jiaoji Railway line and hopes to clear it soon. The troops advancing towards Gaomi on the 6th launched an assault on the city on the evening of the 7th, and Gaomi is expected to fall within days.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Jinan, July 7th] – The National Army pursuing north from Yidu has completely surrounded the Communist Sixth Column, which had infiltrated Shouguang, by the 7th. Another unit of the National Army advancing westward has approached Zihedian and is continuing to pursue the Communist Ninth Column in Linzi and the Communist Third Column in Zhuya and Zhangdian. It is also reported that the Communist Second Column has fled to Gucheng, north of Linzi, while the Rapid Column is in Changshan, and the Seventh Column is in Gaoya, southeast of Linqu.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Yanzhou, July 7th] – The National Army in southwestern Shandong regained key points west of the Grand Canal, including Dachanggou and Jinkou, northwest of Jining, on the 5th. The Dongkou area was also retaken with the participation of strong National Army units. Currently, Chen Yi's four columns and one division, and Liu Bocheng's one column and one independent brigade, though numerous in name, have a total strength of less than 50,000 troops. Since the 6th, the National Army has surrounded them in the narrow area of Dongkou, Yuncheng, and Daimiao. Although the Communists recklessly attempt to cross the Yellow River and flee north, they face constant air strikes day and night. In reality, these bandits are on the verge of complete annihilation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, July 7th] – The battle in western Shandong has entered a tense climax, with the remaining Communists being squeezed by the National Army forces into the area around Liangshan Marsh, mentioned in the novel "Water Margin". The marsh is located in the triangular area where the Yellow River and the Grand Canal intersect. The three counties south of the marsh, Juye, Yuncheng, and Juancheng, are still in the hands of the bandits. On the morning of the 6th, National Army forces launched a pincer movement towards this triangular area. The main force of the left flank attacked Juancheng fiercely on the morning of the 7th, and it is reported that the vanguard has already broken into the south gate. In the past two days, over 10,000 surrendered bandits from western Shandong have been escorted to Xuzhou.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, July 7th] – After the National Army in western Shandong tightened the encirclement, the main force began to engage the enemy on the 7th. The fighting was extremely fierce. The bandits failed to cross the river and made several attempts to break out and flee, but without success, and they are expected to be completely wiped out.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Zhengzhou, July 7th] – It is reported that Liu Bocheng's troops have begun to retreat across the river from the old Fanxian area.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Bengbu, July 7th] – The National Army recaptured Jieshou on the 4th, and Wei Fenghou's troops fled north.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Baoding, July 7th] – The National Army east of Pingbao captured Xiong County at 2 PM on the 6th and is continuing to advance eastward. Another unit of the National Army is conducting mopping-up operations along the Zhulong River, annihilating a Communist regiment. The remnants are retreating towards Hejian. Another unit of the National Army is conducting mopping-up operations in the Baxian and Dacheng areas.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Beiping, July 7th] – The National Army mopping up the triangular area of Pingjinbao, advancing from Rongcheng on the southern route, had already entered Xiong County yesterday. It is reported that the troops advancing from southern Tianjin have already entered Yongqing this morning and are continuing to advance towards Baxian.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, July 7th] – The National Army in northern Shaanxi is conducting mopping-up operations north and west from Bao'an. On the 6th, they advanced to the outskirts of Jingbian City. Another unit of the National Army entered Jindingshan (30 kilometers west of Bao'an) on the same day and is continuing to advance north. Jingbian County is now under the control of the National Army.</p>
<h3>Key Points of the New Life Movement to Coordinate with the Suppression of Rebellion Mobilization</h3>

<h3>Discussion on Impeachment of Elected Officials at the Supervisory Committee Symposium</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, July 7th] – The Supervisory Committee of the Control Yuan held a symposium on the morning of the 7th and focused on discussing the issue of impeaching centrally elected officials. In the past, during the period of political tutelage, the impeachment of elected officials was proposed by the Control Yuan and executed by the Central Supervisory Committee. However, the current government is a tri-party government, so it cannot be handed over to the Supervisory Committee. Furthermore, elected officials are not civil servants, so it cannot be handed over to the Central Government Officials Disciplinary Committee either. The meeting was unable to provide a concrete solution on how to handle this matter and will ask President Yu to seek instructions from the National Government. The meeting adjourned at 10 AM. Many supervisors attended the symposium on the 7th with great enthusiasm. Yu Youren was unable to attend due to a trip to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>National Government Commends Wang Jiarang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th] – The National Government issued an order on the 7th: The Executive Yuan submitted a report from the Ministry of National Defense regarding Wang Jiarang, the commander of the 13th Regiment of the 13th Army of the Army, who died in action resisting the enemy. It was verified that this was in compliance with the regulations of the Martyrs of the War of Resistance and requested that the matter be referred to the Control Yuan for review and a commendation order be issued. It was found that Commander Wang Jiarang fought bravely against the enemy during the Central Plains Campaign in the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), making outstanding contributions. He later died valiantly in the Linru war zone, which is deeply regrettable. He should be commended by a commendation order to recognize his loyalty and martyrdom.</p>
<h3>Democratic Constitutionalist Party Announces Separation from Democratic Socialist Party in the United States</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, July 6th] – The San Francisco headquarters of the Chinese Democratic Constitutionalist Party in the United States announced today that the party has completely separated from the Democratic Socialist Party. The reason given was that the internal divisions within the Democratic Socialist Party have made it impossible for the Democratic Constitutionalist Party to continue the merger. The party also announced that they have resumed their status as a fully independent political party and will establish their headquarters in Shanghai. The Democratic Constitutionalist Party sent a telegram to Zhang Junmai, denouncing the disputes between the centralist and reformist factions within the Democratic Socialist Party, stating that the divisions within the Democratic Socialist Party have rendered the merger with the Democratic Constitutionalist Party meaningless. The original intention of the merger between the two parties was to promote cooperation between the two parties in seeking national liberation. The Democratic Constitutionalist Party has a large number of members both in China and in the United States. The party's predecessor was the Constitutional Monarchist Party. The party merged with the Democratic Socialist Party in 1945 when Zhang Junmai came to San Francisco to attend the United Nations Conference.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, July 7th] – Wan Yaohuang, Chairman of Hubei Province, left Nanjing by plane for Xunyang on the morning of the 7th. After a brief stop in Guling, he will return to his post. Before his departure, Wan spoke to our reporter about the recent situation in Hubei, stating that there are no Communist bandits left in Hubei, and all counties are peaceful, providing a good environment for post-war restoration and reconstruction. The province suffered greatly during the war, especially in western and northwestern Hubei, which were severely devastated. In some county towns, only one-tenth of the buildings remained intact at the time of victory, and most county and city buildings were more than half destroyed. The Hanyi Highway, a vital transportation route, was heavily damaged by the Japanese in order to maintain their supply lines. Within five or six miles along the line, all residents were killed and all villages were razed. In the past and for some time to come, the main task of the provincial government is how to engage in restoration and reconstruction, turning the ruins back into paradise. He came to Nanjing this time to attend the grain conference and the administrative and conscription symposiums. There were no difficulties in the execution of Hubei Province's conscription and grain tax payments. The administrative symposium allowed the central government to deepen its understanding of local politics, which is of great benefit to the future improvement of the system and the coordination of work. Wan expressed his gratitude to the Han City press for their good guidance of politics, and regretted that he was unable to host the Beijing-Shanghai press corps in the province. When discussing the equestrian statue of Chairman Chiang in front of Zhongshan Park in Han City, he praised the sculptor Liu Kaiqu for his exquisite skills.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Guling, July 7th] – Wan Yaohuang arrived in Guling at 4 PM on the 7th after flying from Beijing to Xunyang. He is scheduled to fly to Hanyang in three days. Wan made a special trip to Guling to inquire about his son's illness after completing his official duties in Beijing. Our reporter, who arrived here on the same plane as Wan, interviewed Wan about his gains from going to Beijing and his thoughts on the central government's measures. Wan said: "We feel that China's politics today has already stepped towards democracy, and we are very willing to follow the central government's intentions to implement it, so that the central and local government orders can be coordinated."</p>
<h3>Representatives of Industrial Groups in Shanghai State Their Opinions on Trade with Japan, Petitioning the Government in Nanjing, Hoping the Government Will Take the Initiative</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, July 7th] – The Shanghai Industrial Association, the National Machinery Industry Federation, and other groups sent representatives Hu Boxiang, Mao Shengdong, and 13 others to Nanjing to petition the government regarding the opening of trade with Japan. After arriving in Nanjing on the morning of the 7th, Hu and others went to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other agencies to petition. Director Chen Fang, Secretary-General Gan, Secretary-General Lou, Minister Chen, Minister Gu, and others received them. The representatives stated their opinions on opening trade with Japan, explaining that China's industry and commerce were affected by the dumping of Japanese goods before the war and could not develop. They suffered significant losses during the War of Resistance and have not yet recovered. Therefore, they had previously requested the government to postpone opening trade with Japan. Now that the government has partially opened trade with Japan due to national policy and international situation, the industrial and commercial sectors have put forward the following opinions, hoping to be adopted: (1) Since the government has decided to open trade with Japan, it should adopt public opinion, consult thoroughly, and determine the specific plan for this partial opening of trade with Japan as soon as possible, so as to take the initiative and benefit the country. Anything that can be manufactured domestically should not be allowed to be imported from Japan. At the same time, raw materials should not be supplied to Japan to manufacture goods and then sell them to China, creating an industrial Japan and an agricultural China. (2) The representatives of business must determine their powers, vow to serve the group, and eradicate the attempt to seek personal gain. State-owned and private, without distinction, business and industry, work together, the organization can be sound, officials and the people can avoid isolation. (3) In order to prevent smuggling and fraud, the organization of anti-smuggling agencies should be strengthened, with the full assistance of industrial and commercial groups and the joint reporting of the people of the whole country. State-run progress is extremely rapid, and it may not be impossible to compete with Japanese goods. The government should adopt more protective policies for the Nanyang market. Director Chen and others said that they would be able to adopt the opinions of the industrial and commercial sectors and explained that the restrictions on opening trade with Japan this time were extremely strict, and imports from Japan would not be as easy as imagined. At the same time, the government would also strictly prevent smuggling. The representatives were very satisfied with what they heard. Also, the Capital Chamber of Commerce hopes that two or three places can be allocated to Beijing for sending representatives to Japan.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, July 7th] – The Shanghai Industrial Association and all Shanghai industrial trade associations petitioned in Nanjing for the issue of quota allocation for raw material imports. Tian Heqing, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Industrial Association, also reported on this to the press.</p>

In general, both the Philippine and Chinese business communities have little enthusiasm for reopening trade with the former enemy Japan.</p>
<p>Acheson Refuses to Provide Information on Japanese Trade</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, July 7th] – The US representative, Acheson, chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, today refused to provide the Soviet representative with information on Japan's foreign trade and production outlook, on the grounds that the detailed and extensive information required by the Soviet Union could not be compiled and published in a special form. This is the first time that a formal application to the committee from the four-nation delegation has been rejected by the United States. The Soviet side, represented by Kislenko, asked Trefyanko what kind of goods and how many would be exported by Japan this year through private trade and government exchange. What are the Japanese government doing to increase the production of raw materials and export goods, what are the reasons hindering the development of production, and how do they plan to increase production. Acheson replied: MacArthur's headquarters publishes monthly occupation reports, and the Supreme Commander also publishes in detail the various developments in Japan and the occupying forces. The various groups under the headquarters also regularly issue reports on the progress of their specific work.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, July 7th] – At the request of the Soviet delegation, the 38th Control Japan Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 7th to discuss the issue of Japanese exports. First, Chairman Acheson expressed his opposition, saying: "The Soviet side has requested the provision of information on Japanese trade issues, but the committee is not an agency for collecting information." General Shang Zhen, head of the Chinese delegation, also argued: "MacArthur has not expressed any opinion on the Control Japan Committee before deciding to open Japanese private trade without authorization, and we cannot but be concerned about this. Therefore, the committee should put forward information on trade issues." The meeting adjourned without a conclusion.</p>

<h3>Method for Compiling the Number of Votes for Female Legislative Candidates</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, July 7th] – The National Assembly Delegates and Legislative Yuan Members Election Headquarters has recently provided the following explanation regarding the method for compiling and verifying the number of votes obtained by female legislative candidates: Article 14, Paragraph 2, of the Enforcement Rules of the Legislative Yuan Member Election and Recall Law stipulates that the registration of female candidates should be made to the provincial and municipal election authorities. The provincial and municipal election authorities should immediately notify the election authorities in each district to announce the names of all female candidates in the province on the election ballots in each district for voters to choose. In addition, Article 5, Paragraph 3, of the same law stipulates that the number of votes obtained by female legislative candidates should be calculated separately. Therefore, in the province where the female voting district is located, each district should send the number of votes cast for each female candidate to the province for compilation. In provinces that are not divided into districts, each county or city or equivalent area should send the number of votes cast for each candidate to the province for compilation. Municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan should compile the votes directly through the municipal election office. All should follow the above regulations and calculate the number of votes obtained by female candidates separately, without mixing them with the votes of other candidates.</p>
<h3>Election Headquarters Sends Letters to Provinces and Cities, Setting a Deadline for the Establishment of Election Offices</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, July 7th] – The general election is about to begin, but not many provincial and municipal election offices have been established. Those in charge of the election say that this may be due to transportation issues, as the official seals issued have not yet arrived. The Election Headquarters has sent letters urging them to be established by a deadline. As for the expenses of the election offices in various localities, they will be temporarily covered by the provincial treasuries. The Election Headquarters has requested the central government to allocate funds for transfer. Regarding the question of how to remedy the fact that county election offices cannot handle the election affairs of legislators in the future, he said: The election of legislators is indeed organized by the district election offices, but the chairman of the district office is concurrently held by the commissioner. Therefore, to suit the facts, the responsibility can be assigned to each county in the administrative system to prepare a list of voters. In fact, each county magistrate will also be appointed by the district office to participate in the work in a nominal capacity and assist in the vote counting and supervision to complete the election of legislators.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch, Hangzhou, July 7th] – Chairman Shen returned to Hangzhou last night.

<h3>Hong Kong and Our Government Conduct Economic Negotiations and Cooperate to Stop Smuggling in South China</h3>
<p>[United Press Hong Kong, 7th] A Hong Kong government spokesman announced tonight that the Hong Kong and Chinese governments are now in negotiations to establish a financial agreement to aid China's economic recovery. It is also heard that Lord Keynes, a former advisor to the Bank of England and current advisor to the Central Bank of China, and Thomas, the financial advisor to the British Embassy in China, are also meeting here to discuss issues related to the two countries.</p>
<p>[United Press Hong Kong, 7th] A Hong Kong government spokesman said that the Hong Kong government has handled 500 smuggling cases since the spring of this year.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Hong Kong, 7th] Senior Hong Kong government officials are now carefully studying the issue of smuggling in Hong Kong in order to cooperate with the Chinese authorities. Colonial Secretary McDougall told the Associated Press that the remarks made by Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao in Nanjing in June are now receiving close attention from Hong Kong, and it is expected that the Hong Kong government will issue an announcement soon. Vice Minister Ye said at a press conference in Nanjing that the Chinese government wanted to obtain the cooperation of the Hong Kong government to prohibit smuggling activities in South China, but has not yet been successful. However, we should remember that another senior Hong Kong government official (Superintendent of Imports and Exports) Hemsworth told the Hong Kong court on the 5th that the Hong Kong government very much hopes that this port will not be used as a base for smuggling to harm China's economy. The statement was made at the time of the court's opening trial regarding the 15 tons of goods of unknown origin found on the Xinjiang vessel. It is believed that the Hong Kong government's response to Vice Minister Ye's statement will point out that smuggling incidents are caused by Chinese people and are tacitly approved by Chinese officials, army, and navy personnel. The British newspapers here also pointed out in editorials that the blame should be borne by China itself.</p>

Mr. Wedemeyer then traveled with Admiral Cooke and Consul Spock to the city to General Cooke's headquarters for lunch. In the afternoon, at 1:30 PM, Special Envoy Wedemeyer's party, accompanied by Cooke, went to inspect the Naval Academy, where a fire drill and artillery shooting exercise were taking place. The skills were pure and skilled, which Wedemeyer greatly praised. At approximately 3 PM, they returned to the consulate and held a meeting with Consul General Spock and all staff members, lasting over an hour, during which they discussed the situation in Shandong. Subsequently, they began receiving representatives of American businesses and church representatives, followed by Speaker of the Municipal Council Li Daifen, China Bank Manager Kong Shi, Zhongshan University Professor Meng Yunqiao, etc., for a total of half an hour, during which each person provided Special Envoy Wedemeyer with various written materials.

<p>Special Envoy Wedemeyer Confers with Chief of Staff Chen Before Leaving Shenyang</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 7th] Wedemeyer left Shenyang at 8:50 AM on the 7th to fly to Qingdao. Wedemeyer expressed his gratitude to old friends such as Liao Yaoxiang and bid farewell to Mayor Jin and other well-wishers. The special plane took off amidst the music.

Chen arrived in Shenyang yesterday afternoon and held closed-door talks with Wedemeyer from 8:00 PM last night to 2:00 AM this morning. According to unconfirmed reports, Chen Cheng will replace Xiong Shihui as the director of the Northeast Headquarters, commanding various armies to cope with the sixth offensive that the Chinese Communists are expected to launch within a few weeks. It is a coincidence that Chen suddenly flew to Shenyang from Nanjing at this time. According to the same report, Xiong will succeed Li Zongren as the director of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, and the post of Chief of Staff will be held by He Yingqin, who is currently in the United States. However, the latter statement is purely speculation. After Chen met with Wedemeyer at the hotel, he held a meeting with Xiong Shihui and Acting Commander of the Security Forces Zheng Dongguo early this morning. Wedemeyer then departed for Qingdao in a four-engine transport plane, and the only military officer who saw him off at the airport was Liao Yaoxiang, the commander of the New Sixth Army.

<p>It is also learned that in the reports received by Special Envoy Wedemeyer from various sectors, it was learned that the Communist army's fifth offensive had destroyed 1,100 meters of roads, and 190 meters of the railway between Shenyang and Changchun were destroyed.

These letters were either general greetings or statements of facts and suggestions. He has processed them separately and will submit them for reference after Wedemeyer returns to Nanjing.</p>

Not only were there many difficulties in the investigation, but even if the investigation yielded results, would the wealthy intentionally evade taxes? There were many problems. During the meeting, opinions were exchanged for over an hour on how to make the imposition of property tax effective and practical. Finally, it was decided that the Political Consultative Conference and the Legislative Yuan had both made suggestions on this matter. In order to gather wisdom and benefit from everyone's ideas, it was decided that in the shortest possible time, Secretary-General Shao of the Political Consultative Conference, Vice President Wu of the Legislative Yuan, and Vice President Wang of the Executive Yuan would invite councillors, legislators, and the speakers of the Shanghai and Nanjing Municipal Councils to hold an enlarged symposium to discuss the matter together, and the National Economic Commission would first formulate the main points for discussion.

Another important proposal discussed at the meeting was the factual procedure for the economic reform plan. This procedure was completed on the 6th and 7th, and is divided into matters to be implemented immediately, matters to be prepared for implementation, and matters that have already been implemented and need to be strengthened. In addition, there are also provisions for points that require new laws or amendments to existing laws.

Industry, agriculture, and finance will each form separate groups for separate study. In addition to the participation of members and relevant departments, experts from outside the meeting will be invited. After the groups have studied the matter, they will submit it to the National Economic Commission and then to the Executive Yuan or the Duty Meeting.

<p>[Our Newspaper Xinpu, 7th] The government allocated 1 billion yuan and 10,000 boxes of canned goods to relieve disaster victims in the flood-stricken areas of northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang, 7th] The water level of the Central Canal in northern Jiangsu has continued to rise sharply in recent days. Several sections of the embankment in Suqian have breached, and the water level of the Inner Canal is stable. According to the Construction Department, the Central Canal is rising rapidly due to the Yi and the Si rivers. The water level in Suqian reached 30 meters on the 3rd, which is 23 centimeters higher than in 1921. The dike between Sujiafang and Lijian in the canal has breached, and the Huangdun Lake area west of the dike is flooded, with a water level 1.8 meters higher than that of the canal. The Canal Engineering Bureau has urgently telegraphed the lower reaches of the river to drain water and remove obstacles in the rivers in Pei and other places to facilitate discharge into the sea. The Xiang Canal (i.e., between Huaiyin and Yangzhou) is rising more slowly due to the stable water level of the Huai River. The water is rising sharply, and the embankment near Zhuang has been washed away by the river water and is mostly damaged. The situation is under investigation. If the river water continues to rise or it rains, there will be breaches. The county government is now working hard to repair it.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 7th] The Ministry of Water Resources received a telegram from Su Zhuren Wang Maogong on the 6th at 6:00 PM on the 7th, stating that the Yishui, Si, Huai, and Yellow Rivers were all rising sharply, the situation was dire, and the flooded area was expanding daily to approximately 10 million mu or more, affecting 1 million and several hundred thousand people.

Two-thirds of the autumn crops have been submerged in the water. Among them, the disaster areas in Pi County, Su County, Tongshan County, and Que Mountain County are the most vast, and they have almost become a swamp. The disaster victims are exposed to the wind and dew and are waiting to be fed. In addition, due to the recent surge in water levels in various rivers, the river water has flooded, causing many highway bridges and roadbeds on the Xu (Xuzhou) Hai (Jiuzhou) Lin (Yi) Xin (Anzhen) and Xu (Xuzhou) Jin (Xiang) highways to be washed away. The highest authorities here have strictly ordered the relevant county governments to send laborers to repair them day and night.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 7th] Of the 30th annual tax allocation, the central government originally stipulated that the province and counties should obtain 70% of the actual portion, which would be purchased by the central government and used to replenish the military.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Professor Fei Fei's Illusion!</h3>
<p>Professor Fei Fei, a famous American professor, recently published an article in the July issue of Harper's magazine after returning to the United States from a trip to China last year. Entitled "It Is Time to Withdraw from China," the article pointed out that the United States has only three ways to prevent the Soviet Union from invading China: (1) China should reform its politics and establish a government supported by the people, and implement social reforms to prevent extremists from inciting revolution; (2) Given that the first path takes a long time, the United States must station troops on the Chinese border to prevent the Soviet Union from invading China; (3) The United States should withdraw its labor force from China, maintain true neutrality, and declare to the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union must not take advantage of the situation after the United States withdraws from China. Professor Fei Fei also said that the first path is the safest, the second path is impractical and will not be supported by the US media, and the third path is feasible unless a third world war is inevitable.</p>
<p>Professor Fei Fei was invited by the Chinese Ministry of Education to come to China to give lectures for up to six months. Based on his research on Far East issues and the actual situation in China, he should not be so ignorant. However, after reading Professor Fei Fei's work, we cannot help but express great surprise. Professor Fei Fei traveled in China for six months and gave speeches to Chinese intellectuals in various parts of China. Some of our readers have personally heard his speeches. But it is strange that Professor Fei Fei observed the actual political situation in China through tinted glasses. Intentionally or unintentionally, he wanted to make a side defense for the Chinese Communist Party, saying that they were land reformists, not violent revolutionaries, and even in some places, he not only scratched the surface but also called a deer a horse. When Americans on the other side of the Pacific see Professor Fei Fei's report, they will believe it to be true. But from the perspective of our Chinese readers, we really don't know what Professor Fei Fei saw in China. Professor Fei Fei's words can be considered as the same reports from American left-wing reporters. We might have nothing to say if Professor Fei Fei had published this kind of remark without coming to China for on-the-spot investigation. But Professor Fei Fei came to China for investigation for six months, but he also echoed others' views, which makes us have to doubt his title of "Far East Expert".</p>
<p>Professor Fei Fei's lack of clear understanding of the actual political operation of China, and his distortion of facts everywhere, we will not discuss for the time being, and let discerning people distinguish for themselves. Even in terms of the three ways for the United States to prevent the Soviet Union from invading China, Professor Fei Fei is indeed seemingly right. First, Professor Fei Fei hopes that China can reform its politics and implement social reforms to prevent the expansion of the Communist Party's power. He stands in the position of a friend of China and gives advice to China, and we should accept it humbly. It can also be said that no one in China's ruling and opposition parties is completely satisfied with the current reality, and no one does not want to find a way to improve it. There are already symbols of reform in politics, economy, and society. As long as the CCP does not obstruct it by force, the success of this reform will inevitably be faster. However, although we believe that China's politics and society need thorough reform, we do not believe that China's political reform can prevent the Soviet Union's invasion. To be honest, the reason why the Soviet Union is trying to invade China is not in China, but in the Soviet Union's own development and its plan to dominate the world. Unless China joins the Soviet Union's embrace, the Soviet Union will not stop its support for the CCP.</p>
<p>Second, Professor Fei Fei believes that the United States can only prevent the Soviet Union from invading China by stationing troops on the Chinese border. He himself also knows that this method is not approved by the US media. Knowing this, he still wants to put it forward. On the one hand, it is tantamount to insulting China's national character. On the other hand, it seems to be intentionally arousing the American people's feelings of oppression towards China. Some time ago, President Chiang Kai-shek told some American reporters that he hoped that they would not abuse their power to issue remarks that hurt the friendship between China and the United States. We also hope that Professor Fei Fei will do the same.</p>
<p>Third, Professor Fei Fei advocates that the United States withdraw from China, maintain neutrality, and declare to the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union must not take advantage of the situation. Whether the United States withdraws from China or maintains pure neutrality is a matter for the United States, and the US authorities can decide freely. No one can force the United States. But after the United States withdraws from China, if the United States wants to use a declaration or statement to prevent the Soviet Union from taking advantage of the situation, I wonder how many "gentlemen" can abide by these "gentlemen's agreements?" What's more, under the current US-Soviet relations, whether in Europe or the Far East, the United States and the Soviet Union stand in opposing positions due to different interests and cannot reach an agreement. Does Professor Fei Fei intend to layout for the Soviet Union in the Far East by putting forward this kind of proposal at this time? We have no intention of forcing the United States to join in the Far East, but we can assert that if the US government really adopts Professor Fei Fei's wishful thinking, then the United States will inevitably make an irreparable mistake in the Far East in the future! For the sake of permanent peace in the Far East, and also for the sake of the interests of the United States in the Far East, we must have a serious defense against Professor Fei Fei's illusion, so that the people of China and the United States will not be shaken by him!</p>
<h3>The Third Father's Day</h3>
<p>Today is the third Father's Day.</p>
<p>When the Second World War was coming to an end, celebrities from all walks of life in Shanghai initiated the August 8th Father's Day in order to comfort the fathers of the fallen. According to the plan at the time, they not only hoped that the whole country would unanimously promote Father's Day, but also hoped that it could be promoted to the whole world and become an international holiday. When the second Father's Day was approaching last year, they believed that this move was a pure expression of national integrity during the War of Resistance and was very necessary to promote. In addition to jointly submitting a request to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to be forwarded to the central government for approval and to be circulated throughout the country, they also jointly sent letters to the ambassadors of the four allied countries, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, in China, informing the people of the allied countries to promote it together.</p>
<p>Father's Day has only had a short history of two years since its inception, and it has not yet been formally approved by the central government in China. Although people in countries around the world have the same heart for the virtue of repaying kindness and respecting relatives, countries have not unanimously stipulated August 8 as Father's Day. Therefore, the advocacy of Father's Day is still a long way from the initial ideals of the initiators. It is precisely because of this that we have a greater need to actively promote and practice it. The act of repaying kindness and respecting relatives is not only an inherent virtue of our nation, but also what Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Kai-shek want to promote at a time when the world is changing and customs are fading. Chiang Kai-shek said in his "Repaying the Country and Thinking of Relatives": "Only our ancestors emphasized filial piety first in saving the country. Dr. Sun Yat-sen replied: We have our own way of establishing a country in China. We cannot simply imitate the superficial aspects of foreign countries, let alone copy the ways of imperialists. Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace are the inherent spirit and morality of our country, and filial piety is especially emphasized in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. It can be seen that the way to establish a country in China has always been based on filial piety. The greatest filial piety is to respect relatives, followed by not humiliating them. The so-called respecting relatives means to carry forward the legacy of our ancestor, the Yellow Emperor. The so-called not humiliating means not causing our parents to be in danger." The most obvious difference between humans and animals is that they know where they come from and do not forget the kindness of their parents. "A gentleman devotes himself to the fundamentals. Once the fundamentals are established, the way will be born." There is no one in the world who can forget their roots and talk about making friends, loving the country, or the world being one family. We can almost say that all morality begins with filial piety. From this, it can be seen that Father's Day has a profound meaning and is really worth promoting widely.</p>
<p>The United States initiated Mother's Day at the end of World War I. Due to the active promotion of people of insight from various countries, it has long become an international holiday. The meaning of Father's Day is no less than that of Mother's Day. Mr. Stuart Leighton, the US Ambassador to China, also expressed his support for China's promotion of Father's Day. He said: "Benevolence and filial piety are virtues of the world. I deeply admire your country's initiation of Father's Day, repaying kindness and respecting relatives, and eliminating the scourge of war. I will definitely convey this to the people of my country and promote it together." Therefore, it is very possible for Father's Day to be promoted to countries around the world and become an international holiday in the future, and the Chinese people, who obey filial piety, should have the spirit of not shirking their responsibilities. We should work towards this goal and carry forward the virtues of benevolence and filial piety in China, spread them to the whole world, and realize the great ideal of our sages, respecting the elderly as we respect our own elderly, and caring for the young as we care for our own young.</p>

<h3>UNRRA Materials Originally Scheduled to be Shipped to North China Frozen at 88,000 Tons; Workers on Yellow River Levee Restoration Have All Withdrawn</h3>
<p>[Our City News] UNRRA announced: Since the UNRRA Washington headquarters announced on July 28 that relief materials to areas north of 34 degrees north latitude in China and to areas controlled by the CCP would be suspended, UNRRA has notified all materials stored in various ports that were prepared for shipment to remain in their original locations temporarily. The relief materials that have been frozen include 50,000 tons planned to be shipped to CCP-controlled areas and 38,000 tons to North China. They have all been suspended since the ban was issued. UNRRA attaches great importance to the restoration work on the Yellow River dikes. However, recently, due to the lack of security for the lives of UNRRA staff in the area, they have all withdrawn. However, in Hubei, UNRRA still has 65 staff members stationed in place.</p>

<h3>U.S. Military Advisory Group Hosts Journalists, Reports on American Soldier Murder Case, Public Trial Possible Next Weekend with Death Penalty</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 7th] The U.S. Military Advisory Group held a press conference at 3:00 PM on the 7th in the group's conference room. Colonel Hess Ting, Chief of Staff of the group, Colonel Gope Te, Director of the Office, and Lieutenant Colonel Mikel, Head of the Military Law Group, attended and reported in detail on the handling of the tragic case of the American soldier dumping [the body] outside Guanghua Gate, and the military judicial review process. They stated: After American soldiers commit crimes, they are under the jurisdiction of military law and are tried according to the provisions of military criminal law. A certain crime is reported to the commanding officer, who, based on the severity of the circumstances, organizes a military court of varying scales to file a public prosecution and conduct the trial. The accused can freely choose a civilian lawyer or a military public defender to defend them. After the case of Chinese people being harmed outside Guanghua Gate occurred, the facts of the crime were immediately reported to General Luke, the commander of the military advisory group, and the criminals were detained. After seven days of investigation, the evidence of the crime has been fully collected, and preparations for the trial have been completed. Military court personnel, including Colonel Gradeko and thirteen others, have been appointed as judges, clerks, prosecutors, and a defense team (headed by Major Weiss). A public trial will be held at the Lichi Society next weekend. Journalists are allowed to observe the proceedings and are now entrusted to the Executive Yuan Information Bureau for arrangements. The criminals Adorey and Fan Ni were charged a few days ago with jointly murdering two Chinese citizens. The penalty for their crime is life imprisonment or the death penalty. However, the military court may, based on evidence discovered sufficient to determine that the criminals' crimes are lighter, change the charges. Then "murder" will be replaced by "manslaughter." What is the maximum penalty for "manslaughter"? Unintentional homicide carries a three-year prison sentence, while intentional homicide carries a ten-year prison sentence. According to military law, a person who is sentenced to more than six months in prison is dishonorably discharged from the military. However, the authorities responsible for reviewing the case can order a reduction in the sentence. Colonel Hess Ting hopes that the media will introduce the characteristics of the U.S. military's speedy trial procedures and stated that they will invite some people as private individuals and do not intend to invite our officials to send personnel. According to sources in our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our side will submit evidence and suggestions based on the investigation at any time.</p>

<h3>Key Points of the British Prime Minister's Speech: Elucidating the Government's Economic Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press International, London, 6th] British Prime Minister Attlee delivered today to the House of Commons the most important speech since Britain entered the war in 1939, urging the nation to wage a "New Britain War" against the threat of economic collapse. He stated that the current New Britain War cannot be won by a few people alone but requires the sincere cooperation of all parties to achieve victory.</p>
<p>Churchill's speech on Monday, which stated that the Labor government wasted American loans, was an "unfortunate remark," but it is not necessary to reply. What needs to be stated is that such unfortunate remarks will cause a reaction and harm the country. The claim of wasting American loans is not credible. With loans from the United States and Canada, Britain and the world can buy time to recover, which is beneficial not only to us but also to the world. We originally hoped that this loan would last until 1949 or even 1950, when our country's economy would have a chance to improve and become balanced. However, the current fact is that this loan will be used up before the end of this year, due to the trade deficit, which has led to the depletion of U.S. dollars. Attlee then listed the country's economic policies as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Immediately reduce foreign purchases, by at least 12 million pounds. (2) Only purchase essential foodstuffs from abroad. (3) Increase the unit value of non-essential food rations. (4) If ration quantities need to be reduced, Britain will implement a rationing plan that prioritizes heavy industry workers. (5) Restrict the supply of food and drink in bars and hotels. (6) Reduce the value of luxury goods imports to 5 million pounds. (7) Reduce timber imports, limiting their value to 10 million pounds. (8) Purchase cotton on a long-term basis. (9) Reduce overseas travel allowances from October 1st, reducing the original 75 pounds for twelve months to 37 pounds for fourteen months, and children's allowances to 20 pounds. (10) The allowances for merchants traveling abroad will be strictly limited. (11) Gasoline allowances, which originally allowed for 300 miles of driving per month, will now be reduced by one-third. (12) Gasoline allowances for commercial vehicles will be reduced by 10%, all starting from October 1st. (13) Limit the remittances of foreign film merchants, and the amount of remittances shall not exceed 25% of the profits from their films. (14) By December, 133,000 troops stationed overseas should be withdrawn, and a total of 200,000 troops must be withdrawn by next March. The reduction in military personnel should not affect foreign policy or defense policy. (15) By the end of next March, the British army will be reduced to one million men (according to previous decisions, it is planned to reduce it to 1,087,000 men), so that 420,000 men and women can engage in 15 months of industrial production work starting in March. (16) To promote production, efforts will be made to extend working hours.</p>
<p>British Troops Stationed Abroad Will Be Gradually Withdrawn</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Prime Minister Attlee announced today that after 200,000 troops stationed abroad are scheduled to be recalled by the end of next March, it is believed that those on the withdrawal list will not be limited to British troops stationed in India, Greece, and Italy. In addition to the aforementioned three locations, British troops stationed abroad are also distributed in Germany, Palestine, and other parts of the Middle East. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has denied that British troops stationed in Germany will be withdrawn soon, and judging from the current situation in Palestine, British troops will not be withdrawn for the time being in order to maintain security. Observers believe that if Attlee's planned program is implemented as scheduled, it must be because he is confident that the Palestinian issue can be resolved peacefully within the United Nations framework this autumn, and the situation in Germany will no longer require the presence of a large number of British troops.</p>

<h3>Gunshots in the New Chen Police Station Office: Police Officer Commits Suicide After Being Humiliated. Pan Lianbi, Implicated by His Wife's Crime, Resented It and Shot Himself to Death. The Family Claims That the Police Station Handled the Matter Improperly and Will File a Lawsuit.</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] A suicide case occurred in the office of the first section of the New Chen Police Station at 4:20 a.m. yesterday. The deceased was Pan Lianbi (see photo), the chief of the third section of the Penglai Police Station in Nanshi, 54 years old, from Tianjin, who had served in the police force for more than 20 years. The cause of his death is very tortuous, and police officers deeply mourn his death. During the enemy and puppet period, Pan had contacted Wu Shaoshu and served in underground work. Therefore, after the victory, Wu gave him a small four-inch pistol as a souvenir. It is believed that Pan used this gun to commit suicide yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Pan's suicide was due to the fact that he wanted to smoke opium and was secretly reported, which led to his anger and this action. Pan was employed at the Penglai Police Station in Nanshi, and his residence was at No. 10, Lane 21, Chengdu Road, so it was under the jurisdiction of the New Chen Police Station. The initial course of events was that the New Chen Police Station received an anonymous letter, secretly reporting that Pan Lianbi and his wife were involved in drug use. The first section chief, Lu Tonghua, dispatched four police officers to search the residence at 9:45 p.m. the night before. At that time, Pan was already asleep, and his wife, Wang, was smoking opium in the pavilion because she had a stomach ailment. The police officers of the New Chen Police Station, with the evidence in hand, insisted on taking the two to the police station. Pan argued that his wife, Wang, was the one who was smoking opium and requested that only his wife be taken to the station for questioning, but the police refused to allow him to stay behind. The police officers did not grant his request, and the situation lasted for an hour. They also ordered him to put his fingerprints on the record and insisted on taking him to the station. At this point, Pan angrily said, "Okay, I'll go with you, but please wait a moment while I change my clothes." At this time, Pan had the idea of death and secretly hid the pistol on his body. After being taken to the New Chen Police Station, Pan and Wang were detained, and Pan Lianbi was placed in the office of the first section. At this time, Pan was alone with a lamp, and the more he thought about it, the more resentment he felt. At 4:30 a.m. yesterday, he resolutely pulled out his pistol and committed suicide, aiming at his temple with a loud bang. He fell to the ground, blood gushing out from his right temple. After the incident, the police station rushed Pan to the police hospital for treatment. He died at 5:30 p.m. yesterday without being cured. The bullet remained in his skull and was not removed. The body was transferred to the Changde Road examination site at 10:00 p.m. last night.</p>
<p>Family Members Express Mismanagement</p>
<p>Pan had served in the police force of this city for more than 20 years, and he was kind and amiable in his interactions with others. His death was quite bleak. He left behind three wives and three adopted daughters, but no sons. After the incident, reporters visited the family. According to them: (1) The police should have gone with the baojia chief when searching the residence, but the police station did not do so. (2) Pan was a public official and had no intention of escaping, so why force him to put his fingerprints on the record, which was insulting and caused him to commit suicide. (3) If it was believed that Pan had committed a crime, he should have been searched after being taken to the station. He had a pistol on his body, but they did not know, which was a mistake of the police station. (4) Wang was the one who was using drugs, and Pan Lianbi's crime was only hiding a criminal, which was a minor offense. There was no need to immediately take him to the station. Therefore, it must be considered that the police station handled the matter improperly. It is heard that Pan's family will file a lawsuit against the police station according to the law.</p>
<h3>The Shipping Association Appeals Again: Fight for National Assembly and Legislative Yuan Seats</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Du Yong, chairman of the National Shipping Association, sent a second telegram yesterday to Chairman Chiang, Premier Sun, President Zhang, and Minister Gu, requesting the government to allow the shipping industry to participate in the National Assembly with three representatives and the Legislative Yuan with five members, as the implementation of the constitution is approaching. At the beginning of the association's establishment last month, representatives from local associations proposed that the shipping industry should strive for seats in the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan for professional groups to participate in politics. Representatives were sent to Beijing to petition successively, and their reasons were: (1) The shipping industry has multiple relationships with industry, commerce, and economy, which is different from purely commercial groups. (2) The shipping industry is an independent unit and is not affiliated with any commercial institution. (3) During the Anti-Japanese War, 90% of the national flagships were sacrificed. After the victory, they handled the repatriation work and contributed a lot. The shipping industry has made greater contributions to the country than any other professional group.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Food Distribution Committee held its fourth committee meeting at 10:00 a.m. yesterday at the Lawyers Association, chaired by Chairman Wu Kaixian. The implementation measures for the distribution of edible oil to industrial workers in Shanghai, the detailed rules for the implementation of rice distribution to professional workers, and the issue of rice distribution to the poor were amended and approved. The main points are: (1) The amount of rice to be distributed to the poor in the first phase has been reviewed and completed, and 55,687 shi and 5 dou of rice should be distributed. The handling fee for rice shops is changed to 1,500 yuan per shi. (2) Public rice shops for the poor will be set up in each district. The original plan was to set up one shop for every 500 shi of rice, but now it is decided to set up one public shop for every 200 shi of rice. (3) The original plan for the distribution of rice to the poor was to distribute pure broken rice. Now, because the market price is gradually decreasing, and the difference with the price of rice distribution is not much, it is decided to improve the quality of rice distribution to three-quarters of Burmese rice and one-quarter of broken rice. The distribution price and transportation costs are still 178,000 yuan per shi. (4) Rice distribution to the poor in the first phase has already begun. If each district does not go through the application procedures, it will be considered as a waiver, and the rice to be distributed will be equally distributed for the second phase of rice distribution in other districts. (5) The price of rice distributed to professional workers is 240,000 yuan per shi, plus transportation, warehousing, and sales fees, totaling 250,000 yuan. The distribution procedures are the same as the assistance for the poor's rice sales. (6) The distribution of oil to industrial workers is two catties per month. Because the index for July has been compiled, it will be implemented from August. (7) The request of the Rice Industry Association that each rice shop should receive a legal profit of 6% for handling the distribution of rice to professional workers was rejected.</p>

After entering the venue, everyone waited for the appearance of "Miss International" in the swaying shadows of the dance.

<h3>Impersonating Police Station Personnel to Enter the Door: Fang Jiuxia Robbed of 30 Taels of Gold</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, the Fang Jiuxia Xinjin Jewelry Store on Nanjing Road was robbed of 30 taels of gold by a bandit claiming to be a member of the police station's Economic Section. After the incident, the person in charge of the jewelry store reported to the police station and requested an investigation, but the police station has not yet obtained any clues. It is reported that the bandit was about 25 or 26 years old, spoke with a Hunan accent, and was of medium build. At that time, he showed a "Song Chenwei business card from the Second Section of the Economic Section of the Police Station" and asked to talk to the manager. After being led in by the clerk, he suddenly said to the manager, "I am not a public official, but a member of the underworld. Today, I have come with five brothers, and four of them are still guarding outside the door. Because I have long admired Fang Jiuxia, I have come to borrow 100 taels of gold and demand that it be handed over within five minutes, otherwise I will kill you." After the manager begged, he agreed to 30 taels. After the bandit succeeded, he rushed out of the door. When the people in the jewelry store chased out to see, the bandit's claim that there were four people outside the door was actually a bluff. However, because it was noon and the road was crowded, the bandit escaped without a trace after a slight delay. After the police station announced the incident, fearing that unscrupulous people would take the opportunity to extort money, it announced that in the future, all staff members sent out by the Economic Section will hold a formal "attendance certificate" as proof.</p>
<h3>Yang Anren's Reasons for Disagreeing with the Conviction: Denies Intentionally Giving Others the Opportunity to Seek Profit</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The two defendants in the Jin Chao case, Yang Anren, former deputy director of the National Bank Business Bureau, and Zhan Yunsheng, chairman of the Shanghai Gold Industry Association, were previously sentenced to seven years and four years of imprisonment by the District Court, respectively. Both of them filed applications with the District Court for a new trial. The reasons for Zhan's appeal were recorded in this newspaper on July 29. Yang's reasons for appeal were also sent to the District Court yesterday. His reasons for appeal stated: "The original judgment pointed out that there were errors in the National Bank's gold trading procedures, but according to the decades of practice of Chinese and foreign banks in the gold market, gold transactions are based on paying the money first and then taking the goods. As for the fact that the National Bank received more than 2.5 billion yuan in bank drafts to offset the cash when secretly selling gold on February 8, bank drafts have become a habit in various industries to replace cash, and it has also been adopted by various government agencies. Also, February 8 was the last day for the government to allocate gold to the gold industry. The National Bank collected a large number of bank drafts to offset cash, so that Tongfengyu Gold Company was not affected by the suspension of allocation on February 10. The National Bank's主管 authorities did not know that February 8 was the last day of allocation at that time. The original judgment said that it intentionally gave Zhan Yunsheng the opportunity to seek profit, but there is a lack of active evidence."</p>

<h3>The 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment's 3rd Battalion Transferred to the Capital; Rumors Indicate Replacement by the Independent 3rd Battalion</h3>
<p>The 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment, stationed in this city for nearly two years, received an order from Gendarmerie Commander Zhang Zhen on the 5th to temporarily transfer the regiment's 3rd Battalion to the capital. On the evening of the 6th, at 11 p.m., all officers and soldiers of the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 3rd companies under the battalion, led by Battalion Commander Niu Yukun, departed Shanghai by vehicle. It is noted that the gendarmes who clashed with the police in the "Jindu Bloodshed Incident" belonged to the 3rd Battalion. The order for the battalion to transfer is considered an appropriate measure to ease tensions between the police and gendarmes before the formal trial of the case. However, the parties involved in the case, including 8th Company Commander Wang Tingyun, 9th Company Commander Ren Yafu, and Platoon Leader Li Yutai, did not travel with them and are temporarily staying at the regimental headquarters awaiting interrogation. Their duties have been temporarily assigned to others. After the 3rd Battalion is transferred to the capital, the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 23rd Gendarmerie Regiment have also prepared their gear, but have not yet received any orders. A responsible person from the regiment spoke to reporters yesterday about the "Jindu Bloodshed Incident," expressing deep sorrow and unwillingness to say much, only stating: "The truth will speak for itself." According to reliable sources, the Independent 3rd Gendarmerie Battalion will replace the 23rd Regiment in Shanghai, and the battalion is expected to arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>

Yesterday morning around 9:00 a.m., he was recruiting volunteers in front of the New Oriental Hotel when he was spotted by a street patrol officer, who took him to the Lao Zha Police Station.

<h3>### Private Demolition of Air Raid Shelters; First Trial Yesterday; Rui Baogong Lent the Money; Time After Construction Began</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Rui Baogong, Dean of General Affairs of Fudan University, Zhang Guoxian, Principal of the National General Primary School, and foremen Che Jigui and Guo Ruimao, etc., were accused of illegally demolishing large air-raid shelters. The case was heard for the first time yesterday in the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court by Judge Mei Erhe. Zhang Guoxian stated: "In order to expand the National Continuing Primary School, I discussed demolishing the air-raid shelters with Fudan in November last year. Before construction began, I borrowed one million yuan from Fudan as wages. Two-thirds of the demolished bricks and tiles would belong to the school for construction purposes, and one-third would be given to the foremen as wages."</p>
<p>Rui Baogong stated: "The location of the air-raid shelters was the site of the former Shanghai University, which was allocated to Fudan. Zhang wanted to demolish the air-raid shelters to expand the primary school. I stood on the educational standpoint and was very sympathetic, but did not agree. As for the loan of one million yuan, I lent it to him privately. The money was lent twenty-some days after the construction started and had nothing to do with wages." Foreman Che Jigui stated: "I signed a contract with Zhang to demolish the air-raid shelters. Rui Baogong urged me several times to finish the work quickly. No one interfered during the demolition. The school took one-third of the demolished bricks and tiles, and I took one-third as wages. When I transported these bricks and tiles away, Fudan refused to issue a certificate, so the police questioned me." Guo Ruimao's statement was similar. Witness Yu Shuzhi testified that Rui did tell Zhang that he had to report to the relevant authorities. The court adjourned the hearing, stating that the case was still under investigation.</p>

<h3>### A Large Batch of Smuggled Goods Discovered on the Qimei Wheel; Value of 150 Million</h3>
<p>Four Crew Members Detained and Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office</p>
<p>[Our Report] Xu Xueyu, General Manager of the National China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, recently sent a letter to the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office, stating that four employees of the company's Qimei Wheel, including Zhou Zhaozhun, had privately smuggled goods worth a total of 150 million yuan. He requested a legal investigation. The original letter stated: "On July 26, the Qimei Wheel, which arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, had a large batch of smuggled goods discovered by the company's police team in conjunction with customs in the third cabin deck mezzanine. The value of the goods was 150 million yuan. In addition to all the smuggled goods being handled by customs according to law, this large-scale smuggling is suspected to involve the person in charge of the Qimei Wheel. The ship's First Mate Zhou Zhaozhun, freight officer Duanmu Jin, watchman Yu Caigui, and sailor Ren Xitang were detained and sent for legal handling. Also, the ship's chief sailor, Qi Afu, fled in fear of punishment. A resume and description are attached for arrest."

<h3>### Famous Northwest Drug Traffickers Busted in the Dasing Hotel; Five Criminals Arrested, 18 Ounces of Heroin Seized</h3>
<p>At the end of last month, Chief of the Army General Staff Chen Cheng secretly telegraphed Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, stating that there was a large-scale "Northwest Gang" drug trafficking organization in this city, scattered in various hotels, ordering a swift crackdown. Commander Xuan received the telegram and ordered the Investigation Department to take charge of the case. Director Tao then instructed the First Brigade to conduct a thorough investigation. After several days of careful arrangement, it was finally discovered in the late night of the 2nd of this month that there were five people from Ningxia in the Dasing Hotel on Simalu, whose behavior was suspicious. An investigation was immediately launched, but nothing was found. Unexpectedly, just as they were at a loss, a quarantine certificate was suddenly picked up in the corridor. The name and place of origin filled in on the certificate were Ma Xingzong, 19 years old, from Ningxia, and a photo was attached, which matched the sixth name on the secret arrest list opened by Chief of Staff Chen. Without showing any signs, the appearance of the passengers was secretly checked. It was indeed similar to Wang Jinshi, who lived in Room 28. At this point, it was determined that Wang was an alias of Ma Xingde. On the morning of the 3rd, they entered Room 28 and searched, finding five criminals: Ma Xingde (alias Wang Jinshi), Ma Zhongde (alias Ma Ming or Ma Mingwu), Tian Zhiyuan (alias Tian Xingkui), Yang Shouren, etc., and seizing 18 ounces of heroin in a special compartment in a leather suitcase. The people and the goods were then escorted to the brigade headquarters for strict interrogation. According to Ma Xingde's confession: They are indeed well-known "Northwest Gang" drug traffickers. The leaders are Chen Zhaokui (alias Chen Ying), Ding Zhanlin, and Guo Shenglv, etc., totaling fifteen people. Except for the three criminals Chen, Ding, and Guo, the remaining twelve are all accomplices. The drug trafficking location is secretly purchased from Peiping and then brought to various parts of the Northwest for sale. On July 19, he was ordered by the principal offender Chen Ying to bring heroin in Peiping, along with Yang Shouren, Ma Yifang, Tian Zhiyuan, Ma Zhongde, Li Shengwang, Wang Shengsan, Ma Fang, Ding Zhanlin (the principal offender), Guo Lu (the principal offender), Ma Tianguo, etc., to Shanghai. At that time, they lived in the Zhongnan Hotel, Dasing Hotel, and Oriental Hotel. At that time, each criminal carried a large amount of drugs. The other criminals, Chen Ying, Yang Xueren, Zhang Fengxuan, Ma Yongzhi, Ma Xuedong, Wang Yihe, Yang Wengui, Hai Yuzhen, and Ma Junqing, etc., are still in Peiping in charge of receiving goods. However, Ding Zhanlin, Guo Shenglv, and others arrived in Shanghai on the 25th and left Shanghai the day after, turning to the Northwest, leaving only five of them in Shanghai, who were arrested when the case broke out. The Investigation Department has sent telegrams to security agencies in various places to assist in the arrest of the principal and subordinate offenders who have left Shanghai one after another. A group of people will be transferred to the local court for strict handling today.</p>

<h3>### Crackdown on Pharmacists and Pharmaceutical Students Holding Nominal Concurrent Jobs</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Many pharmacies in this city manufacture proprietary medicines or dispense prescriptions without complying with regulations. Although they employ pharmacists and pharmaceutical students, they are only nominal employees. The Bureau of Health believes that this is very important to the health of citizens, so in order to strengthen management, it recently convened a meeting with the New Medicine Manufacturing Association, the Pharmaceutical Association, and representatives of various pharmacies to discuss and resolve: (1) The Bureau of Health will publish a notice in the newspaper, setting a deadline to strictly crack down on pharmacists and pharmaceutical students holding nominal concurrent jobs. (2) The New Medicine Manufacturing Association and the Pharmaceutical Association will be notified separately to instruct their members to make adjustments within three months (from August 1 to the end of October) to ensure that there is a pharmacist for drug manufacturing and a pharmaceutical student for dispensing prescriptions, and that they are actually serving in their positions. (3) Starting from November 1, the Bureau of Health will send personnel to conduct random inspections. If a pharmacy is found to be manufacturing drugs without a pharmacist or dispensing prescriptions without a pharmaceutical student, the first offense will be fined 300,000 yuan, the second offense will be shut down for three days, and the third offense will have its license revoked and be ordered to close down.</p>

<h3>Victory at Linqu</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter Li Tian in Jinan] Barely half a month after "unveiling the prelude to the great counteroffensive," and in the last week of this fiery July (starting from the 24th), Chen Yi, with his seven columns of 150,000 troops, launched this year's largest "counteroffensive" on the Shandong battlefield against the city of Linqu, a transportation hub. The flames of war, like this fiery July, spread fiercely.</p>
<p>Linqu is a small city located on the west bank of the upper reaches of the Mi River. A tributary of the river flows north of the city and meets it two miles away. A highway connects to Yishui and Linyi in the south, and to Yidu, Shouguang, and Yangjiaogou in the north. In addition to materials and soldiers from northern Shandong passing through this place to the remote mountainous areas, supplies from a certain group relocating from Lüda across the Bohai Sea were also unloaded at Yangjiaogou and transported to the mountainous areas via Linqu. Therefore, Linqu is actually the general transportation hub for the CCP in Shandong. At the beginning of July this year, the deceitful army made a foray, and then gave up immediately. However, the army occupied the city again. The original city, which had been thoroughly destroyed by the National Army when it occupied it, and whose area was less than half of that of Tai'an.</p>
<p>General Li Mi</p>
<p>After entering the city with his six regiments, in addition to clearing out the communist bandits and comforting the refugees, he first started to repair the fortifications and rebuild the city walls. But in the end, the time was short. How much could be done in 36 hours? Therefore, apart from completing some necessary field fortifications, the so-called permanent fortifications were actually out of the question. From 9:00 p.m. on the 24th, the bandit army first used five columns and a part of the local team to attack the four passes regardless of sacrifice. Among them, the attacks on the North Pass and Qushan, which is one kilometer east of the city and can overlook the entire city, were the most fierce. However, all the soldiers in the city, under the command of General Li Mi, were able to regard death as home, advancing without retreating. The city walls were therefore ensured. From dawn on the 28th, the communist bandits increased their troops by two columns, totaling seven columns including the fast column and the 2nd, 6th, 7th, 9th, 3rd, and 5th columns. Except for the 3rd column stationed at Sanchakou as the general reserve team and to block the National Army from Namma from going north, the remaining six columns joined the attack. Especially the heavy artillery of the fast column constantly bombarded the city, and most of the houses in the city were destroyed. More than a thousand bandits broke into the North Pass. Sergeant Jianzhong was forced to carry three injuries, but he still fought to kill the enemy and did not retreat. Battalion Commander Hou Xijin and Zhou Yu-kuan were also inspired by the regimental commander and did not retreat despite being wounded.</p>
<p>Therefore, the three armies obeyed orders and the morale was greatly boosted, and at about 4:00 pm, all the remaining bandits who broke into the city were annihilated. Upon hearing the news, the highest authorities issued a special order to distribute 300 million yuan in consolation money, ordered to be transferred by Wang Yaowu. On the night of the 28th, the communist bandits intensified their offensive, and the east and west sides of the city were broken into three times by the bandits, but all were repelled. On the morning of the 29th, the sky suddenly became overcast and it rained heavily. The communist bandits took advantage of the difficulty of activity of the national air force and launched a full-scale attack. In the fierce battle until night, except for Qushan in the east of the city and a corner in the south of the city, which were still held by the National Army, the rest fell into the hands of the communist bandits. At this time, the National Army in the city had been struggling for five days and nights. There were no supplies or ammunition inside, and no reinforcements outside. At this point, the war had reached its most critical moment. Finally, relying on General Li Mi's command, calm operations, and at the same time, the air force defied the worst climate, dividing day and night, giving bombs to the bandits and supplies to the defenders, in addition to rice and flour, and agreeing to the defenders' request, transporting a large number of bullets and cannons from Jinan, they finally survived the last departure. On the 30th, they first repelled the bandits from the east and west gates. On the 31st, they went north from Naxieyuezhuang, and from Changle and Juxian southward</p>
<p>Two-Way Army</p>
<p>First arrived at the line of Muhu Mountain and Nigu Mountain eight kilometers east of the city, and the upper and lower five wells ten kilometers west of the city, giving the attacking bandit army a counter-encirclement. The communist bandits initially struggled, but by 5:00 pm on the 31st, the National Army's encirclement was getting smaller and smaller, and the defenders in the city, with the arrival of the response troops, fought more and more bravely. They first lifted the siege of Qushan in the east of the city. The bandit armies, seeing that the general situation was over, began to break through in three directions. One route, with one and a half columns, broke through and fled to the southeast towards Liushan Village and Jiangyu. Another route, with one and a half columns, broke through and fled to the northwest towards Zhuyai. The main force, about four columns, fled north towards Yidu. One division that had originally occupied the North Gate was annihilated by the National Army because the order came too late. The bandit army division commander and more than a thousand of his troops fled back to rescue and struggled to the death before breaking through and fleeing. By the afternoon of the 1st, the National Army pursuit troops had already docked at Yidu and Liushan Village. When the National Army cleared the battlefield, they found more than 9,000 bodies of bandits left behind, and more than 5,000 wounded soldiers. Together with the officers and soldiers who died later, the number of casualties of the bandits in the past eight days was</p>
<p>At Least 40,000</p>
<p>More than people, and the stream of the Mi River was stained red by it. And the National Army casualties were only two regiments and one battalion, creating the largest victory since the Great Search in Siping Street. This victory not only eliminated some "combat power" of the bandits in Shandong and ensured the past victories of the National Army, but also stabilized Changyi. (Li Mi's troops are the elite of the National Army in the Changyi area. If Linqu is not defended and Li's troops are "eaten," Changyi will inevitably be unable to defend itself. The impact on central Shandong and even the entire Zhou is not difficult to imagine.) And it also eliminated the "fighting spirit" of the bandits in Shandong. Although Chen Yi has reorganized more than a dozen local teams in Jiaoxi into ten independent brigades again, attempting to regroup after the Qing Sha rises (the second half of August) for the last fight, the main force of the Shandong communist bandits (whether Chen Yi's or Liu Bocheng's), after the various large and small battles in the fiery July, is obviously facing the eve of the German collapse, which is an undeniable fact. And with the coming of August (unless the Shandong communists increase their troops again from the Northeast or Hebei and Shanxi), at least south of the Jiaoji Railway, the communist bandits, in addition to imitating the past in northern Jiangsu and dividing into several small groups to engage in a wandering life, cannot have any decisive impact on the Shandong situation or even the overall domestic situation. This is a well-known fact. (1st)</p>
<h3>A Refugee Woman in the Pixian Disaster Area Suddenly Goes into Labor on a Willow Branch</h3>
<p>Scorched by the Sun and Rained on, Mother and Child Die Together</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent Fang Canglang, 6th] The floods in the Yi and Shu rivers in the border area of Jiangsu and Shandong have caused an unprecedented flood disaster in the Xu, Hai, and Huai prefectures in the past 20 years. Wherever the floodwaters passed, fields were submerged, people and livestock were killed, and homes were destroyed. The refugees in the Pixian disaster area, which was the worst hit, were in a pitiful situation. Many of them died of starvation on trees and roofs after not eating for several days. A few days ago, a woman in the northern township, in order to avoid the water, climbed a willow branch. Suddenly, she went into labor and safely gave birth to a son. However, due to being scorched by the sun and rained on, and being exposed to both heat and cold, both mother and child died together. The tragic situation was so severe that those who heard it were saddened.</p>
<p>Wang Baozheng, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, Liu Pingjiang, Secretary-General of the Provincial Senate, Dong Shang, Chief of Finance, Lu Xiaobo, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce, and Jin Chongru, Executive Director of the Northern Jiangsu Refugee Relief Association, etc., received the press in Zhenjiang on the 4th to report on the disaster. Chairman Zhu expressed his grief and compassion, and repeatedly emphasized the importance of relief work in a kind and caring tone, saying that saving the people is the natural duty of revolutionaries. Secretary-General Liu Pingjiang reported that the people in the various counties of Xuzhou have suffered in recent years from the burden of military supplies, engaging in repairing dikes, digging trenches, building cities, and dredging rivers, all in the communist bandits' traitorous military actions. Faced with the current tragic natural and man-made disasters, and the righteous actions of the people of Northern Jiangsu to serve the country and support the government for the suppression of the rebellion and nation-building, the people of Northern Jiangsu have really not failed the country, and the government should not sit idly by and do nothing when they are suffering this great disaster.</p>
<h3>Call for Voices: Transforming into Candles of Light, Illuminating Refugee Homes</h3>
<p>After Su Bei Refugee Association Standing Director Jin Chongru reported on the impending crisis of future Yellow River disasters and the overall disaster that Su Bei would face, he once again made a passionate appeal to the reporters present, asking them to report the flood situation in detail and recite a five-character poem: "May the hearts of reporters transform into candles of light, not illuminating silk-clad seats, but illuminating refugee homes!" After listening, the reporters responded with a round of applause.</p>
<p>Natural disasters have arrived, and man-made disasters have not ceased. The suppression work in the Su Bei Pacification Area urgently needs to be advanced. It is heard that the bandits in Binhai and Guo Xiahe are actively preparing to seize grain and coerce the disaster victims. Commander Li Mo'an of the First Pacification Area of Nantong and Commander Zhang Xuezhong of the Huaihai Pacification Area of Huaiyin are both planning a thorough suppression during the hot summer. According to concerned people, although the strength of the National Army in Su Bei today needs to be increased, it is undoubtedly sufficient to monitor the remaining bandits and advance to suppress them at the opportune time. The most worrying thing at present is that the self-defense forces in various counties cannot be effectively utilized. Deputy Commander of Security Mai Baoshan once publicly pointed out that the self-defense force has become a tool for urging rent and settling accounts, and a lackey of local tyrants and evil gentry. The Communist bandits even ridiculed the self-defense force as an "escort of honor for weddings and funerals," a military arsenal that does not require labor. Reporters believe that if this point is not quickly addressed and reformed, there will be little success to speak of.</p>

The "quick monkeys" harvested in Dongtai and Xinghua counties are said to be selling for only 90,000 yuan per shi, a very low price. Therefore, the villagers are once again worried about low grain prices hurting farmers. Those who are accustomed to hoarding grain for profit have already pointed their arrows at food. In the past week, grain prices in Zhenjiang have been quite chaotic, but the general expectation is that unless the early rice in Jiangnan is fully harvested and the flood does not continue to expand, the rice price can remain within the 250,000 mark. Grain prices have already been severely stimulated by the floods.</p>
<p>The summer clouds are not yet gone, and the heat is gradually dissipating. The price of melons has fallen to 500 yuan per catty. However, the various industries in Zhenjiang City are still in a midday sleep. The long, asphalted Daxilu Road is quiet and silent, resembling a small town in the countryside. This is because the operating expenses of businesses are increasing day by day, while the purchasing power of consumers is weakening day by day. The commercial market is as still as stagnant water, with only the political departments showing a glimmer of vitality, as conscription and grain administration have been actively launched. The government is busy surveying disasters and providing relief, and preparing for universal suffrage. As the autumn wind is about to rise, rumors of a light tax reform of the Jiangsu provincial government have spread in Beijing, but according to well-informed sources, this move seems to be still pending.

<h3>China Trust Bureau Convenes Meeting to Discuss Oil Production Methods</h3>
<p>Seeking Increased Edible Oil Production to Support National Mobilization Plan</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Central Trust Bureau convened a meeting yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM to discuss ways to increase edible oil production. Attendees included representatives from the Central Bank (Pan Jiufen, Shen Zhurui), the Agricultural Bank of China (Wang Botian), the China Plant Oil Factory, and the Plant Oil Refining Industry Association of the Third District (over ten representatives in total), presided over by Wang Yinpu, the chief of the Bureau's Audit Department.</p>
<p>The main focus of yesterday's discussion was how to coordinate with the National Mobilization Order, entrusting relevant production agencies to secure a large quantity of essential daily necessities to ensure sufficient supply for consumption, while also changing the past reliance on loan-based methods to increase production. The China Plant Oil Factory was instructed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to increase edible oil production by 20,000 dan, and the Four Banks Joint Office approved a commissioned production arrangement with China Plant Oil to increase production. Subsequently, the Central Bank's President Zhang requested an expansion of the production plan, specifically increasing the target from the planned 20,000 dan to 30,000 dan. The Bureau carefully discussed the novel method of commissioned oil production, and the results were satisfactory. The implementation details will be finalized soon.</p>
<h3>Mayor Concerned About Edible Oil Supply</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Guozhen has expressed great concern regarding the supply of edible oil in the city. He met with Zhang Decheng and other representatives from the China Plant Oil Factory at the mayor's office in the municipal government yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM to inquire about the situation. Zhang and others provided detailed reports on the supply and price of edible oil, and also reported that the factory had previously lent 7,000 dan of edible oil to the Civil Food Allocation Committee for the purpose of widely distributing oil, which led to a temporary suspension of regular distribution starting on July 12th. Subsequently, fearing fluctuations in the market price of edible oil, the factory also sold 2,567 dan of rapeseed oil to the market continuously from the 1st to the 6th of this month to stabilize prices. Now that the Civil Food Allocation Committee has decided to only distribute oil to industrial workers, the borrowed 7,000 dan can be returned. Therefore, the China Plant Oil Factory will soon be able to resume the distribution of edible oil through 600 retail oil stores.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang and others analyzed the reasons for the rising oil prices, stating that the fluctuations were largely due to rampant smuggling in South China. Raw oil from Qingdao costs 800,000 yuan per load, and after adding 50,000 yuan for shipping to Shanghai, it costs 850,000 yuan. However, prices in South China are even higher, making smuggling very profitable. Another reason is that although the new soybeans are available, the quantity is small, and inventories are low, leading to an imbalance between supply and demand. Private oil factories are now buying rapeseed and switching to rapeseed oil production. Therefore, while the supply of raw oil is insufficient, the supply of rapeseed oil is expected to be adequate in the future.</p>
<h3>Arbitrage Interest Rates Plummet, Shanghai Stocks Remain Stagnant</h3>
<p>Shanghai stocks remained stagnant yesterday as major off-exchange investors turned bullish, interest rates opened low at 1.2 and 1.65 fen, and money was loose and cheap, making arbitrage very inexpensive. Buying gradually recovered. Although there were unfavorable developments along the way, the opening and closing situations were extremely stable. Popular stocks like Yongsahong showed signs of rebound, while miscellaneous stocks were less optimistic. The overall trend remained stagnant.</p>
<p>The market opened high in the morning due to the large difference in exchange rates between forward and national banks, and news that the Tianjin Stock Exchange would also open soon, boosting investor confidence. Yongsahong opened at 135 yuan, and after the opening, numbers 133, 186, 235, 89, 160, and 12 all advanced, while numbers 14 and 2115 advanced in ready Yongsahong, and the market climbed to 231 yuan. Numbers 97 and 235 sold ready Yongsahong, and numbers 224 and 223 also closed out positions at high prices, forcing the price down to around the morning opening price.</p>
<p>After 10:00 AM, with the addition of positions by numbers 207, 12, and 157, numbers 225 and 230 also acquired current delivery Yongsahong, gradually stabilizing the market. However, the next most popular stocks did not benefit, and Huafeng Enamel suffered even more under the heavy selling pressure from number 220 and the Industrial Bank. Extending to after 10:30 AM, it was heard that a banking group was aggressively buying off-exchange, and numbers 231, 116, and 207 absorbed positions on-exchange. Numbers 95, 116, and 130 then advanced in ready Yongsahong again, and the forward-date Yongsahong briefly rose to 234 yuan. Numbers 2113 advanced and then exited, and numbers 218, 235, 103, and 155 also supplied shares for sale, while numbers 147, 235, and 97 continued to sell ready Yongsahong, forcing the price back down to 227 yuan. Meiya fell back below the 400 yuan mark again, ultimately remaining mostly flat, with limited price increases. Numbers 116 and 125 absorbed positions again, and numbers 32 and 130 also acquired current Yongsahong. By closing time, the popular stocks were in a slightly better position. Yongsahong closed at 227 yuan and 231 yuan.</p>
<p>After the close, asking prices were lower, with forward Yongsahong retreating to around 230 yuan. Compared to the previous closing prices of ready delivery stocks, Huafeng suffered a slight decline, Xinhua fell by 0.5%, while Yonggong, Xinhe, Meiya, Xinguang, Yongsahong, and Zhongfa rose slightly, Jingfu and Qinxing remained flat, Xinya fell by slightly less than 10%, and Guohuo Cement, Datong, and Lian remained flat, Zhongfang, Tongyi, Zhongsheng, and Rongfeng rose slightly, and underwear, Jinglun, and matches fell slightly. Among the forward delivery stocks, Huafeng was flat, Meiya rose slightly, and Yongsahong, Xinguang, Yonggong, and Jingfu all rose by slightly less than 0.5%. The other old stocks remained relatively stable.</p>
<p>In the ready forward arbitrage market, banking groups were still mostly buying at a premium yesterday, with limited trading and interest rates ranging from just over 6 fen to around 1.1 jiao. Among them, the Yongsahong premium retreated from 6.5 yuan to close at 5.2 yuan. Meiya's high was 12 yuan, the low was 10.5 yuan, and it closed at 11 yuan. Xinguang rose from 3 yuan to 4.5 yuan, closing at 4 yuan. Huafeng fell from 2.5 yuan to close at 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Rebound, Foreign Stocks Mediocre</h3>
<p>Government bonds also rebounded yesterday, with trading volume increasing to around 7 million yuan. Unified C Agricultural opened at 10,900 yuan. After number 360 sold, it covered positions, and although numbers 552 and 230 sold, numbers 550 and 503 both added positions, causing the price to rise sharply, stabilizing slightly after reaching 11,900 yuan. A and B also rose from 7,400 yuan to close at 8,000 yuan, an increase of 700 yuan for A, B, and E compared to the previous close, Unified C rebounded by 1,000 yuan, and Unified D also rose by 600 yuan.</p>

Securities firms bought British American Tobacco, which was sold by banking groups. Wool was also supplied by banks. Ewo Silk opened at 86,500 yuan, fell to 84,500 yuan, and then rebounded to close at 86,000 yuan. Compared to the previous close, Wheelock Marden and Indo-China Steam Navigation rose slightly, China Paper and Ewo Brewery remained flat, Ewo Silk, British American Tobacco, Yieh Hsing, and China Steel lost slightly, while Shanghai Telephone fell by less than 0.5%.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Rice Market, Japonica and Indica Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of about 6,300 shih of rice arrived in the north and south markets, but the market remained sluggish, and the trend continued to decline. Japonica rice and early thin rice both fell by over 10,000 yuan. The influx of new Japonica rice led to a sharp decline of over 10,000 yuan, with medium-grade and lower-grade rice falling into the 40,000 yuan range. Baiyuan and Yinyuan rice both fell sharply by 100,000-200,000 yuan. Indica rice lacked buyers, and rural merchants were absent, leading to a further decline of 100,000-200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The sluggish trend of flour resulted in a slight decline of 1,000 yuan. Bran sales were clear and sluggish, falling by another 300-500 yuan. Summer cakes rural sales had become sporadic. The season for new autumn crops was approaching, and fertilizer sales were coming to an end. There were occasional inquiries from other areas in Taiwan, but transactions were limited, and the market was mediocre. Soybean arrivals were sold in exchange, and the situation was stable. Mung beans remained sluggish, gradually becoming slightly cheaper. New mung beans from Sichuan, Zou, and eastern Zhejiang arrived in Shanghai, but the future outlook remained unfavorable. Red beans were firm. Yuan wheat was sold as soon as it arrived, and there was little impact. Corn from North China became active again, rising by another 10,000 yuan. Deliveries of red sorghum were weak, and prices fell by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Sesame remained weak, and deliveries from various regions continued, indicating a downward trend. Shelled peanuts from South China continued to be processed, advancing by 10,000 yuan. Broad beans saw slight movement from out-of-town merchants and local streets but remained stable. The price of English beans remained unchanged. Flour mills were buying wheat at 148,000 yuan, and the standard for medium-grade wheat was still based on moisture and ash content.</p>
<p>In the oil market, interest from Guangdong merchants waned, and local streets also lacked significant buying interest, with only sporadic small transactions. All oils declined by 100,000-200,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Closure of Hong Kong Zhenghe Bank</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 7th] Following the sudden announcement on the 6th that Zhenghe Bank was suspending operations, those involved in the banking industry expressed shock. The bank opened last year, with its main business focused on serving overseas Chinese. According to sources, the reasons for the bank's closure are as follows: (1) Two months ago, the bank sold a large amount of national currency at low prices, and this currency was mostly remittances from overseas Chinese in other regions. Recently, the currency rose, and the bank's received remittances were due for payment. (2) A long-distance trading company affiliated with the bank recently suffered excessive losses. (3) After the closure of the Shantou branch of the long-distance trading company, depositors rushed to withdraw their funds. (4) The bank's opening costs reached 300,000 Hong Kong dollars, accounting for 20% of the paid-up capital (1 million Hong Kong dollars). (5) The bank adopted a standalone development strategy, with no connections to other banks, leaving it isolated and without support. Creditors have already held meetings to discuss how to recover their losses.</p>
<h3>Textile Adjustment Group Meeting Held Yesterday, Reducing Negotiated Prices for Fine Count Yarn, Lower Than Last Price by 200,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Textile Adjustment Negotiated Pricing Group held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Many committee members attended, with Rong Erren serving as the acting chairman. After discussion, the original negotiated prices were deemed too high due to the recent weakness in yarn prices. After renegotiation, the price of 10-count yarn was set at 6.82 million yuan, and the price of 16-count yarn was set at 8.62 million yuan. The above negotiated prices remained unchanged. 20-count yarn was priced at 9.6 million yuan, 32-count yarn at 12.8 million yuan, and 40-count yarn at 14.4 million yuan, all 200,000 yuan lower than the previous negotiated prices.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to informed sources, the fact that market prices for fine count yarn have been lower than the negotiated prices recently is due to the Textile Construction Company's extensive sales. The majority of the output for yarns of 20 counts and below comes from private factories. Recently, sales have been sluggish, causing market prices for coarse count yarns to be higher than negotiated prices. Therefore, it is hoped that private factories will also comply with the agreed-upon sales, so as to jointly cooperate to suppress yarn prices.</p>
<h3>Coarse Yarn Shows Slight Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was still mediocre at the opening. Later, Guangdong merchants slightly reduced their inventory, and local dyeing factories and weavers absorbed yarn of 20 counts and below. By the end, the market rebounded. As a result, 42-count double-ply Lanfeng fine yarn continued to fall by 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 16.65 million yuan. Baoguang Shuiyue and 40-count Jixiang Baoguang, 32-count double-ply Fengnian, and other fine yarns all decreased by 30,000-100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse rebounded by 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 12.2 million yuan. Zhuanbian Shuyin also rose by 150,000 yuan, to 1.045 million yuan. Zong Jincheng Red Thread, Tian Funu Double Happiness, and 16-count Guangming Sanming Tian Funu Hailong, 10-count Thread Ziche Jinbao Star, and 6-count Dasheng and other grain yarns all rebounded, ranging from 100,000 yuan to over 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Still Lacks Improvement</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market remained sluggish and lifeless yesterday. Out-of-town merchants still lacked purchasing interest, and local merchants only made small replenishments. By the close of the market, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth had fallen to 419,000 yuan, down 4,000 yuan from the previous day. Wufu, Lanji, Caiqiu, Yanghe, and other grades also decreased by 2,000-3,000 yuan to 6,000-7,000 yuan. The markets for other unbleached cloth, coarse cloth, and Biji cloth were also lackluster. Shilin cloth, Taohuawu, and Baimao printed cloth saw slight reductions in factory prices.</p>
<p>In addition: The China Textile Construction Company continued to sell cloth yesterday, selling a total of 2,200 bolts, with 73 applications. Two local manufacturers purchased 240 bolts. 71 cloth shops purchased 1,960 bolts. The listed item was still one type of Five Cotton B-branded fine cloth, with the price reduced to 362,000 yuan, and Jumping Carp Biji cloth at 420,000 yuan. It is also heard that the company will be transporting a large batch of cloth to South China for sale within this month.</p>
<h3>August Civilian Coal Allocation Totaling 5,000 Tons</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The total amount of civilian coal to be supplied by the Fuel Management Committee in August is still set at 5,000 tons. The allocation price may be adjusted appropriately based on actual costs.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Plans to Request National Bank to Restore Original Fuel Oil Quota, Reduced to 2 Million USD in Third Quarter</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In April and May of this year, a fuel oil panic occurred in the city, with unscrupulous merchants hoarding and speculating, leaving citizens with nowhere to buy fuel. Furthermore, due to illegal merchants mixing gasoline into the fuel oil, fires broke out repeatedly. Although the problem was very serious at the time, the actual supply and demand were relatively balanced. After the Social Affairs Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, and Fire Department jointly took appropriate measures, the situation was quickly resolved. However, the consumption of fuel oil was lower during the second quarter due to the summer season. In the third quarter, as autumn and winter approached, the demand for fuel oil gradually increased. The Social Affairs Bureau sent a letter to the Temporary Import Management Committee requesting an increase in foreign exchange allocation.</p>
<p>Now that reports indicate that the fuel oil quota for the third quarter has been reduced to 2 million USD, a 30% decrease from the 3.3 million USD in the second quarter, fuel oil panic is bound to reappear. The actual supply is insufficient, making it difficult to stabilize the market. Furthermore, artificial fuel oil is of poor quality and extracted from diesel fuel, which will lead to diesel re-entering the black market, benefiting unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>In light of this, the Social Affairs Bureau plans to request the Central Bank to approve the restoration of the original fuel oil quota in order to stabilize the market. According to relevant sources, restoring the original import quota should not be a problem, and the city's fuel oil supply should not be at risk.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving Industry Holds Subcommittee Meeting Opposing Increased Price of Artificial Silk, Awaiting Approval from the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs</h3>
<p>The silk weaving industry has been opposing the China Trust Bureau's increased allocation price of rayon. After sending representatives to petition the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau, the issue has garnered attention from various parties. According to sources from the association, silk weaving industries in Hangzhou and Suzhou have also sent representatives to Shanghai to hold a subcommittee meeting with local representatives yesterday afternoon to review countermeasures. They decided to continue striving for a reduction in the allocation price. Otherwise, over 400 silk factories in the city, as well as their counterparts in Suzhou and Hangzhou, are prepared to halt production in protest. They are currently awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other relevant agencies. Sources have also revealed that the authorities are carefully considering a thorough approach to the allocation of rayon and may adopt measures similar to the control of cotton yarn, whereby the authorities entrust silk factories to weave silk fabrics using rayon, and then sell the finished fabrics entirely through the China Trust Bureau, in order to prevent merchants from hoarding and speculating.</p>
<p>Rayon Market Fluctuates, Factory Management Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market fluctuated. Number 120 Kosan Yukomyo opened at 24.8 million yuan in the morning and closed at 24.5 million yuan on the selling side, representing a decline. The price then rebounded in the afternoon, with a final transaction price of 24.9 million yuan, resulting in a decrease of 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The factory management market remained stable yesterday, with very few transactions. C-grade was offered at 29.2 million yuan, and D-grade was offered at 8.8 million yuan. The asking price for dry silk was the same as yesterday. Silk goods rose after the market opened due to large purchases and short covering.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Disposes Enemy Assets Worth Over 900 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to information from the China Trust Bureau, the value of enemy and puppet assets disposed of by the bureau totaled over 900 billion yuan by the end of July this year. The bureau was instructed by the Executive Yuan to dispose of 50 billion yuan of enemy and puppet assets monthly. However, in recent months, the value of disposed assets has consistently been around 100 billion yuan per month.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou's Trade Surplus Nearly 8 Billion in July</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 7th] According to statistics, Fuzhou's trade in July showed exports of 29.4 billion yuan and imports of 21.5 billion yuan, resulting in a trade surplus of over 7.9 billion yuan. Exports were almost entirely special products, with timber exports accounting for 17.2 billion yuan, tea for 3.1 billion yuan, and paper for 2.7 billion yuan, indicating an improvement in the price of timber.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Market Weakens Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Taiwan sugar market weakened again. The reporter noted that all of the transactions were for medium white sugar, and due to the lack of strong buying interest, the market did not fare well. The association's list prices were 550,000 yuan for medium white sugar and 555,000 yuan for Taiwan red sugar, both down slightly by over 10,000 yuan. Four-and-a-half white coarse-packaged sugar was priced at 680,000 yuan, and oil-extracted green sugar was priced at 420,000-30,000 yuan, with very few transactions. Xinghua white sugar was priced at 570,000-80,000 yuan, and Xinghua red sugar at 420,000 yuan, with a total of 200-300 baskets traded. 50 baskets of Hainan red sugar were priced at 425,000 yuan, and 50 bundles of Diaoqing sugar at 340,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dim Tea Market</h3>
<p>Various teas for domestic sales have seen a decline in activity since the connection and acquisition by local merchants and out-of-town traders. The demand appears to be temporarily satisfied, resulting in a relatively sluggish market. However, sentiment remains positive, leading to a stable but stagnant situation. As for foreign tea houses, there has been no improvement in transactions. The trend remains calm and unfavorable due to the firm stance of the goods owners.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Cigarettes Rise in Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market opened with firm sentiment. Anglo-American cigarettes saw brisk trading, and the market atmosphere was lively. Due to strong demand, "Ten Great Britain" brand cigarettes rose to 9.76 million yuan, a rebound of 230,000 yuan from the previous day. "Old Knife" brand cigarettes also rose by 120,000 yuan to 7.55 million yuan. "Five Flowers Ha" cigarettes also saw a rise of several tens of thousands in customs price.</p>
<p>Among Chinese-branded cigarettes, "Brandy," "Crest," "Red Gold," and "Red Man" brands saw relatively strong sales, with prices rising by 200-300 to 500-600 yuan per carton. "Beautiful Gold," "Gu Quan Lu," and "Change Axe" brands remained stable. "Camel," "Lucky Strike," and "Morely's" cigarettes saw little change. "Listening Head" cigarettes such as "Cavendish," "Three-Five," and "Water Doctrine" brands rebounded by 500 to 1,000 yuan due to scarcity.</p>
<h3>Active Spot Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was active. Due to the previous day's purchase offer from the Textile Construction Company, many in the trade sold cotton due to long-standing trading relationships. However, the offered prices were not high. Lingbao cotton reached a maximum price of 2.15 million. Customers felt that the Textile Construction Company's offer was lower than private factories, and sentiment was weak, so they dared not raise prices. Those with urgent cash needs also sold off their cotton. Traders actively covered their positions, and both buying and selling were brisk in the market. Various firms traded Lingbao cotton at 2.12 million, 2.13 million, 2.14 million, 2.15 million, and 2.175 million. Han fine cotton traded at 1.95 million, 2.02 million, and 2.03 million. Shashi cotton traded at 2.065 million, Laohekou cotton at 2 million, and Shandong Toray Silk at 2.1 million. Pudong fire engine cotton traded at 1.725 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton traded at 315,000 per load.</p>
<p>Another news item: The China Merchants Bureau's Cai E ship sailed to Qingjin yesterday, loaded with a large batch of foreign cotton, including 500 bales for Qingdao and more than 6,400 bales for Tianjin. A slight pullback is expected. This cotton is being transported by the China Textile Corporation.</p>
<h3>Timber Market Conditions</h3>

<h3>Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Clarification</p>
<p>Dismantling Doors and Windows, Moving Furniture: Two Households Show Off Their Power, People Suffer Amidst Roof Noises</p>
<p>Dear Editor: My father rented a house at a certain location in August of the 27th year of the Republic of China. There was no lease agreement at the time. Later, the landlord, Sun, sold the house and moved with it to a house on Nanchang Road, living in a large room with three machines and one large item. The monthly rent was paid monthly and never in arrears. Later, at the landlord's request, they moved to a smaller room. My father tolerated this due to his circumstances. Now that my father has gone to Japan for work, Sun's family is using the excuse of taking back the house for their own use, forcing them to move into a small, cramped room, taking advantage of them and making threatening remarks. Now I have several questions and would like you to answer them: (1) Is it illegal for Mr. Sun to take back the house for his own use under the pretext of self-occupation? (2) Is it illegal for Mr. Sun to dismantle doors and windows and move furniture without permission? How should we deal with this? (3) If we take this matter to court, can we win?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan Answers] (1) Taking back for personal use requires providing concrete evidence. (2) Before legally terminating the lease, if the landlord dismantles the doors and windows of the rented house or moves the tenant's belongings without authorization, and if there is violence, coercion, or obstruction of the exercise of rights, a report can be made to the police station for the crime of obstructing freedom. (3) The court should base its judgment on the facts, evidence, and the law.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>The Father</h3>
<p>— By Bjornstjerne Bjornson, Translated by Cao Guoping</p>
<p>People all said that this man was quite wealthy and influential in the parish; his name was Sandor, Oflaas. One day he was in the pastor's study, a tall and enthusiastic man.</p>
<p>He said, "I have a son, and I want to have him baptized."</p>
<p>"What do you want to call him?"</p>
<p>"Finn—after my father."</p>
<p>"Who are the godfathers and godmothers?"</p>
<p>"They are all relatives of Sandor, all unanimously recognized and proven to be the best men and women in the parish."</p>
<p>"Is there anything else?" the pastor asked, looking around. The farmer (Sandor) hesitated a bit, and finally opened his mouth:</p>
<p>"I would very much like to let him perform the baptism himself."</p>
<p>"Then on the day of the week, right?"</p>
<p>"Next Saturday at twelve noon sharp."</p>
<p>"Is there anything else?" the pastor asked again.</p>
<p>"Nothing else." The farmer twisted the hat in his hand as if he were about to leave. The pastor stood up.</p>
<p>"Alright!" the pastor said, walking towards Sandor; he shook his hand and looked at him with a serious look and said:</p>
<p>"God has given you this child, he is your only happiness."</p>
<p>Sixteen years later, Sandor revisited the pastor's study.</p>
<p>"Really, your years have passed very happily, Sandor!" the pastor said with surprise and joy, because he had not changed his old appearance at all.</p>
<p>"This is because I have no worries." Sandor replied.</p>
<p>The pastor was silent, and after a moment he asked, "Why are you so happy again tonight?"</p>
<p>"The reason I have come is for my son, who will be formally confirmed tomorrow."</p>
<p>"He is a clever child."</p>
<p>"Before I hear the number of the seat he deserves in the church tomorrow, I don't want him to be allowed into the church."</p>
<p>"He will get the first place." the pastor said.</p>
<p>"I heard. Here are ten dollars for you." Sandor said.</p>
<p>"Is there anything else I can do for you?" the pastor stared at Sandor and said.</p>
<p>"Nothing else."</p>
<p>Sandor went out.</p>
<p>Eight years passed like flowing water. One day there was a commotion outside the pastor's office. Many people wanted to go in, and Sandor was the first to enter.</p>
<p>The pastor greeted them and paid his respects to Sandor.</p>
<p>"Have you come to attend this evening party? Sandor."</p>
<p>"I have come here to ask you to have the letter announcing the wedding period printed for my son, he is going to marry Karen, Storiten. She is the daughter of Jude Meng, who is standing next to me now."</p>
<p>"Oh, she is the richest girl in this parish."</p>
<p>"They say so…" the farmer replied, stroking the hair on the back of his head with one hand.</p>
<p>The pastor stood quietly for a while, as if deep in thought. Soon, without any comment, he recorded the names of the two people in the book, and signed his own name below.</p>
<p>Sandor put three dollars on the table.</p>
<p>"I only need one dollar." the pastor said.</p>
<p>"I understand this, but he is my only son, and I want to do things generously."</p>
<p>The pastor took it.</p>
<p>"Sandor, this is the third time you have come here for your son's affairs."</p>
<p>"But now I have settled his lifelong problem for him." Sandor folded his pocketbook and said goodbye to the pastor.</p>
<p>Those people followed Sandor slowly out.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, the father and son were boating on the lake. It was a quiet and peaceful day. They were going to Storiten's house to discuss and plan the wedding.</p>
<p>"This transverse thwart is not very stable," the son said, and stood up to level the plank.</p>
<p>Soon, the thwart he was sitting on vibrated and slid under him. He stretched out his hand to grab something, shouted, and fell out of the boat.</p>
<p>"Hold tight, son!" the father shouted frantically, jumped closer to him, and threw out the oar.</p>
<p>His son tried three times unsuccessfully, making him gradually panic.</p>
<p>"Wait a moment," the father shouted, struggling to rock the boat closer to his son.</p>
<p>Then the son struggled hard on the surface of the water, finally looked at his father and sank.</p>
<p>Sandor could hardly believe that his son had drowned; he held the boat pole, staring at the spot where his son had sunk, as if his son would float to the surface again. Some bubbles rose to the surface of the water, gradually increasing, and finally one large one burst; the lake waves returned to smooth tranquility like a mirror.</p>
<p>For three days and three nights, people saw the father circling the scene of the accident, shaking, forgetting to eat and sleep; he was scooping the lake water in order to get his son's body. On the third morning, he found it, held it in his arms, and carried it to the mountain of his own home.</p>
<p>One year after this incident, one late autumn evening, the pastor heard several people looking carefully for something in the corridor outside the door. The pastor opened the door, and a tall and thin man, with a hunched body and pale hair, walked in. The pastor had to carefully look at his face for a long time before he could recognize him.</p>
<p>It was Sandor!</p>
<p>"Why are you still walking so late?" the pastor said in front of him.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is, it is earned." Li said, taking a pair of pants. The pastor also sat down, as if waiting for something, silent for a long time.</p>
<p>Finally, Sandor said;</p>
<p>"I have some things with me that I would like to give to the poor. This is a share of my son's inheritance, and I hope it can be invested to generate interest."</p>
<p>He stood up, put the money on the table, and then sat down again.</p>
<p>"This is a large sum of money." he said.</p>
<p>"This is the price of half of my land, which I have already sold today."</p>
<p>The pastor sat quietly for a long time, and finally he asked;</p>
<p>"Sandor, what do you intend to do now?"</p>
<p>"Something better."</p>
<p>They looked at each other for a moment, Sandor's lowered eyes were pinned by the pastor's gaze. Immediately the pastor said gently:</p>
<p>"I thought your son finally brought you true happiness."</p>
<p>"Yes, I thought so too." Sandor said, looking around, two large teardrops slowly flowed down his cheeks.</p>
<p>Author's Biography—Bjornstjerne Bjornson (1832-1910) was a poet, novelist, playwright, orator, and political commentator. He engaged in literary work in the early 20th century, and he had innate intelligence. Considered along with Ibsen as the two greatest Norwegian writers. This "Father" is the most brilliant short masterpiece, worthy of showing the author's talent. Although the text is short, the meaning is extremely rich, and it can be called profound. (Translated from Bjornstjerme Bjemson Complete Works “The Father”)</p>
<h3>Feelings on Father's Day</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiqu</p>
<p>In the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China, Yu and other colleagues, Yuan Xilian, Chen Qingshi, Mei Lanfang, Shi Zhifu, Lu Ganchen, Yan Duhe, Fei Mu, and Fu Wenshou Luo Junzi, jointly initiated the August 8th Father's Day, hoping to repay virtue and respect parents, and eliminate the scourge of war. Unexpectedly, after the initial pacification of foreign troubles, internal strife arose again, human relations were lost, and material desires ran rampant. Looking at the difficult times, poetry cannot fully express my meaning.</p>
<p>Eight operas wash away enemies in the Milky Way, but family strife cannot wash away new tear stains,</p>
<p>Swords and silk are distant dreams, beasts in clothing are vaguely neighbors;</p>
<p>Thousands of miles of homesickness bring constant sorrow, a hundred years of nation-building begins with kinship,</p>
<p>When autumn comes, tell the osmanthus trees to sing together for the evergreen Father on this festive occasion.</p>
<h3>Dad</h3>
<p>— Lianzi</p>
<p>Today is Father's Day, and it is also the day of the Autumn Solstice. I imagine that this afternoon, at the moment of the Autumn Solstice, Dad will surely be happily distributing watermelons to his daughters, and I believe that at this time he will definitely think of his daughter who is missing him here. The eight years of wartime exile have made us suffer enough. In order to fulfill Dad's three desires of guarding the festival, my eldest sister and I used the weak strength of two girls to support this family with difficulty. Not to mention eating melon to relieve the heat, we didn't even have food to eat when we were at our poorest, but I never forgot to buy a watermelon for Dad on the Autumn Solstice, even if it was just a small one. I know Dad would not forget our family's tradition for generations—the whole family eats a little watermelon on the Autumn Solstice! I can't bear to watch Dad feel uncomfortable on this only festival of the year, for not having a slice of watermelon to share with his children.</p>
<p>I remember one day, Dad came back from the outside, the sorrow on his face was even heavier. He tried his best to avoid my inquiring gaze, but finally, with a trembling voice, he quietly said to me: "Child! There are rumors outside that your second brother has been killed in battle. I dare not publicize this news, for fear of making your grandmother and mother anxious, because in our poor family, we can no longer..." I was stunned by this shocking news, but when I saw Dad's worried face, I endured my tears and comforted him: "Dad! I don't think we can easily believe the rumors, I'm afraid someone is deliberately spreading rumors." Dad grasped my hands tightly and nodded with a half-believing look, but from then on, the anxiety hidden in Dad's chest made his body even thinner and weaker.</p>
<p>The war dragged on day by day, and our suffering deepened. June 12th—this is also a day forever engraved in my heart—there was not a grain of rice in the house, and not a penny in our pockets. "What are we going to use to cook?" Mother said anxiously. I searched east and west, and suddenly found half a tube of yeast for making noodles. I exclaimed with joy, I said. "Mom! Let's use it to make cakes to eat!" Mom, the eldest sister, and the younger brother all knew that this was not good food, but other than that, what better food did we have? I just thought that grandmother was old, how could she swallow this rough food? Dad had been sick in bed for two days, how could he eat this sour and hard cake? Suddenly, I thought of the two pieces of candy that a colleague had given me in my pocket, which I had originally prepared to bring back to Dad, who was sick, so I crushed the two pieces of candy, wrapped them in two cakes, and baked them softly. I gave them to Grandma and Dad. Grandma couldn't bear to eat them alone, so she gave half of them to her little brother, who was looking at the hot cake. I don't know if Dad was hungry, or if he hadn't tasted sweetness for a long time? After eating, he said he wanted to eat another one. But how could I make another sweet cake? Little brother didn't know whether it was to please Dad, or whether he thought the cakes were all sweet? He secretly took a cake to Dad. Dad took a bite of the sour and hard cake, and he understood. When we and Mom were discussing how to make another sweet cake, Dad came, and he saw the two candy wrappers on the table, and understood everything even more. He said with tears in his eyes, "Poverty can take away all my enjoyment, but it can't take away my children's filial piety to me; what sumptuous feast in the world can be more delicious than this sweet cake?" Dad's joyful and poignant words moved us and brought tears to my eyes. I wanted to avoid my face so he wouldn't see the tears hanging on it, but in a moment of panic, my hand that was pressing the cake didn't press on the cake but pressed on the hot pot and burned out blisters. Dad lovingly pulled my hand over and carefully bandaged it with some medicine. Bathed in Dad's kindness and love, a smile appeared on my tearful face, and everyone was amused by my appearance of being both sad and happy. We ended this simplest and most sumptuous lunch in this mood of alternating crying and laughing.</p>
<p>The news of the victory came so suddenly that we were so surprised that we were suffocating. Dad did not forget his second brother in his joy, and a faint shadow of worry still lightly covered his cheerful face.</p>
<p>That day, as we were discussing how to return to our broken home (because relatives in the countryside wrote that our house had not been completely burned down), a green-clad man stuffed a letter in through the crack in the door. I quickly ran to pick it up. When I saw the name of the sender on this travel-worn envelope, I couldn't help but jump up and down, "Ah! Dad! This is a letter from my second brother!" Tears of joy blurred my vision. Dad tore open the letter with trembling hands and read it with all his strength, as if he were a sacred pastor, reading the solemn Bible. The old grandmother in the corner of the house also listened restlessly, laughing and crying with joy! On the last piece of letter paper, there was also a money order attached, which solved our problem of returning home.</p>
<p>We hired a boat, moved our simple and broken luggage, said goodbye to the house where we had depended on each other for seven years, and returned to our hometown with a light heart. The small trees we planted eight years ago had grown lush and pleasant, and they swayed in the wind as if welcoming the return of the masters who had been separated for eight years. Dad stood among the weeds beside the flower bed, supporting a chrysanthemum that he had loved deeply before and that was still living old now, looking at Dad's white hair scattered in the west wind, I thought of my former strong father, and the eight years of chaotic life. Not only had it added to his decline, but it had also deepened the old age of his soul! Just like this frost-resistant chrysanthemum, buried in the weeds!</p>
<p>This year's lunar New Year's Day is Dad's sixtieth birthday. We all brought gifts and went home to celebrate his birthday. Because of the suffering of living under someone else's roof, we arrived home in the evening of the Lunar New Year's Eve in a torrential rain. Grandmother tried to make a fire so that Mother could quickly make some snacks for us to fill our stomachs and drive away the cold. Mother was cutting the meat vigorously, and Dad suddenly remembered something and went to the room to get a lot of candy to distribute to us. When I saw the wrapper of this bag of candy clearly, I admired Dad's memory as much as mine, because I had not forgotten this candy for making cakes for Dad, and there were still many hidden in the box, ready to be given to Dad as a gift. My fourth brother also noticed, we threw ourselves into Dad's arms, shedding tears of joy under his caress, until Mom called us to eat snacks, then we left Dad lovingly.</p>
<p>When Dad was young, he poured all his energy into his ten children, but today, when all ten children have grown up, has he ever enjoyed a little bit of his children's happiness? Thinking of this, I couldn't help but feel ashamed again.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Abscess</h3>
<p>— Shi Lang</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen "Sunrise" knows that there is a "Golden Man" who never appears on stage, but issues orders from behind the scenes, ruling his own "kingdom."</p>
<p>There are many such people in Shanghai, but they are not as exclusively unscrupulous as you might imagine. Because these people have some knowledge of literature and music, why can't they also feign elegance?</p>
<p>Like Ximen Qing, a familiar figure, he is skilled in both martial and literary arts. He can associate with those in power and collude with local bullies.</p>
<p>Therefore, the "gangster" sued by more than two hundred businesses along Avenue Edward VII is seen as quite normal and peaceful by Shanghainese.</p>
<p>It seems that as long as Shanghai exists, these "movie stars" should also exist.</p>
<p>This is like a person "drinking poison to quench thirst." One day, he can no longer sustain his life with medicine. On his fleshy face, there is a lack of vitality.</p>
<p>Such people are like "abscesses" growing on the bodies of Shanghainese. They have been around for too long, and it seems they should exist. Therefore, the lawsuit by more than two hundred shops on Avenue Edward VII gives us a sense of surprise.</p>
<p>Can we fundamentally remove the "abscess" on Shanghai's body through surgery? This is a terminal illness, and only with the determination of both doctor and patient can it be fundamentally cured.</p>

<h3>Introducing Two Female Ambassadors</h3>
<p>— Rong Guan</p>
<p>Madam Pandit and Madam Kollontai</p>
<p>Since the provisional government of India announced the appointment of Nehru's sister, Madam Pandit, as India's first ambassador to the Soviet Union, female ambassadors representing their countries abroad have no longer allowed Madam Kollontai to be the sole pioneer!</p>
<p>Shen Bao reported on the 4th, citing a London broadcast: "India's first ambassador to the Soviet Union, Madam Pandit, took a flight to Fissco on the 3rd." As the telegram indicates, this first female ambassador of Asia, Madam Pandit, was born in 1899, ten years younger than her elder brother Nehru. Although she is also a "old" woman of forty-eight! She has a "weather-beaten" face, graying hair, and a medium build. She, her brother, and her husband, Mr. Pandit, have all been involved in the struggle for India's independence, and she has been arrested and imprisoned three times. Mr. Pandit's life ended due to the setbacks and hardships of the revolution, but his mother is still alive and is now over ninety years old. Her daughter, Xi Xueliya, is accompanying her to the Soviet Union this time. In the past, Madam Pandit was in charge of education in her birthplace of Allahabad, and she also served as the president of the All-India Women's Association and represented India at the United Nations General Assembly. At the United Nations Conference in San Francisco last year, although she participated as a representative of the Indian people, her appeals and activities for India's freedom and independence won the sympathy of the world. Mr. Mao Shuqing, the Shen Bao's special correspondent in the United States, praised her in his New York correspondence as the most successful speaker among the twenty-odd chief representatives. (See the Shen Bao of November 30th last year.) Her English is very clear in every syllable, although there is a bit of an Indian accent mixed in, but it is not annoying to listen to. Recently, she served as the Minister of Health of the United Provinces. Her reputation in the country is comparable to that of the late British Minister of Education, Miss Wilkinson. With such a woman with rich political work experience taking on the new position of India's first ambassador to the Soviet Union, she can undoubtedly be competent and happy. Her success is not only the happiness of the Indian people but also the glory of all East Asian women!</p>
<p>Speaking of Madam Kollontai, her name is even more familiar to the world: she is the world's first female diplomat and also the first female ambassador stationed abroad. She was born in 1872 in the home of a wealthy landowner in Russia. Her husband, Alexander Kollontai, was a nobleman. Although she broke away from her stubborn family at the age of eighteen and dedicated her youth and life to the women's liberation movement. She spent more than twenty years in exile. She attended university in Germany, specializing in economic issues and women's issues. In 1917, she left Germany to engage in the anti-imperialist movement, but she was soon arrested by the government and imprisoned in a dark hell. Fortunately, the October Revolution in the Soviet Union rescued her, and she began to be reused by the new government, taking on work in education and other fields. In 1921, Madam Kollontai was appointed as the ambassador and trade representative to Norway. In 1926, she was transferred to be the ambassador to Mexico. In July 1930, she was transferred to be the ambassador to Sweden, and has remained there until now. Madam Kollontai is indeed a remarkable figure. She is a versatile, knowledgeable, and capable woman: she is a diplomat, educator, expert on women's issues, and a talented writer. She has two famous works that have been introduced to China: "Red Love" and "Three Generations of Love." She believes that career should be more important than love, which may be the reason for her success. She has even more extensive writings on women's issues and is considered the theoretical authority on women's issues.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Private School Achievements</h3>
<p>— Fang Ren</p>
<p>The exhibition of private school achievements, sponsored by the Municipal Bureau of Education, opened on the 5th at the Jiaozhou Road Experimental Private School. The participating units reached 120, the exhibition rooms occupied eleven rooms, and the participating exhibits totaled 11,774 pieces, which can be said to be a grand spectacle.</p>
<p>The achievements of each unit are roughly divided into three parts: one is administrative, such as daily logs and registers; the second is instructional, such as homework and test papers; and the third is promotional, such as manuscript purchases and newspaper clippings. In addition, the Experimental Private School also handles promotional district business and has a model of land and buildings in the promotional district, which is very outstanding.</p>
<p>It is said that many experts have been invited to judge the achievements participating in this exhibition, so there is no need to add much. Now, after a cursory glance, the reporter will briefly express his impressions as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The development direction of the achievements of various private schools is very uneven. A few only use student homework and test papers to fill the space, which is inevitably a bit monotonous. In fact, student homework and test papers are very easy to collect, while administrative and promotional achievements are subject to continuous records and cannot be fabricated arbitrarily, so they are rare and valuable.</p>
<p>(2) The exhibited achievements should be limited to the scope of the unit's own responsibilities. If they are irrelevant, they should be omitted. For example, one or two show silk fabrics, belts, light bulbs, cigarettes, and thermos bottles produced by factories as exhibits, which is too broad and inevitably loses the original nature of the exhibition. Because private schools do not have courses such as factory work, and such industrial products cannot be made with the existing equipment of the school; therefore, they seem superfluous.</p>
<p>(3) Statistical charts should focus on accurately representing numbers and clearly showing proportions. The brightness of colors, the quality of paper, and the sophistication of the project are secondary. A few schools neglect the former and focus on the latter, which seems unnecessary.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the layout aspects, the Experimental Private School has a unified and harmonious look because it has set aside three separate rooms; the other units are jointly displayed, and some have few achievements but occupy a large area, while others have many achievements but are cramped in a corner; also, the size, horizontal and vertical orientation, and height of the charts are all left to their own development, and the points of unity and harmony seem to have been neglected.</p>
<h3>Leading the Way</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>Pilgrims to Putuo were kidnapped, and two hundred million yuan was used to get them out of danger—see a Japanese newspaper in this city in August.</p>
<p>On the sacred mountain, on the sacred mountain, Buddhist teachings are boundless, pilgrims compete to seek new blessings and longevity, the water and land rituals at the temple cause trouble, and life and death are at stake.</p>
<p>Rich guests, rich guests, think of becoming immortals once they are rich! They don't know that the Compassionate Guanyin is stingy with her ferry, ferrying back and forth on big king boats, two hundred million turns into wasted money!</p>
<p>American Miscellany Xu Shuyuan The War Brides of American Soldiers</p>
<p>War brides are the inevitable product of "war." War brides can be called genuine or non-genuine. For example, if a soldier marries a woman during the war, she is of course a genuine war bride. If a businessman marries a woman in the rear while escaping hardship, she cannot be considered a genuine war bride because her husband never fought in the war but only escaped to avoid it. The number of American war brides can break world records. Millions of American soldiers went to Europe and the Pacific, most of them unmarried men. When they arrived in England and France, due to the harmony of customs and habits, coupled with the loneliness in the military, and the scarcity of men in England and France, this large group of young and strong American men naturally became the coveted objects in the eyes of English and French women. On one side, Luo Fu had no husband, and on the other, the envoy had no wife, so they naturally hit it off. Moreover, America is a paradise in the eyes of women around the world, and everyone wants to marry a strong American husband. After the peace, American troops withdrew from Europe, followed by ship after ship of war brides and Victory Babies. Tens of thousands landed in New York each time, and they were transported for a full two years before tens of thousands of war brides and Victory Babies were brought over.</p>
<p>The English and French lost both their wives and soldiers in this war, but the Americans gained hundreds of thousands of outstanding people without any effort. These hundreds of thousands of new population were, of course, the result of the hard work of American soldiers. American women inevitably felt jealous of these new sisters-in-law because they had taken away the fiancés of American girls, but what could be done about the "fait accompli"? Chinese-American soldiers and American soldiers stationed in China also married many war brides in China. These Chinese women who married American soldiers, including dancers, socialites, Jeep girls, and daughters of modest families, were also quite numerous. They have now been sent to the United States in batches by special American government ships. The last batch of about one hundred people gathered in Guangzhou, transferred to Hong Kong, and sailed across the ocean to the United States. Most of these Chinese war brides cannot speak English, so taking care of them along the way is quite troublesome. More than four hundred people have already departed from Shanghai for the United States. Each time, senior American officers were sent to lead the team, and translators were selected to take care of them on board. These Chinese women had never set foot abroad in their lives, and some had never even left Shanghai. They knew nothing about the new family life in the United States. The escorts set up an English literacy class on the ship and taught them to read "O-P-C-T" and speak simple English every day. After the ship arrived in New York, the escorts' responsibilities were not yet over. They also had to send them to their new families in various parts of the United States and complete the formal transfer procedures. About 40 percent are in Chinatown in New York, 40 percent are in Chinatown in San Francisco, and the rest are scattered throughout the United States. There are also many speculators who took advantage of their brief relationship with American soldiers to pretend to be war brides and go to the United States. Therefore, the American authorities must verify the marriage certificate. Therefore, at a certain time, they were busy trying to obtain proof documents. These proof documents were more valuable than the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' passports because those who obtained the proof documents could not only securely obtain American citizenship but also arrive safely in the New World for free.

<h3>Idle Chat in the Bean Arbor</h3>
<p>— Fang Wuzhi</p>
<p>Tang Ju said to Lord Xinling: "There are things that cannot be known, and there are things that cannot not be known; there are things that should not be forgotten, and there are things that cannot but be forgotten."</p>
<p>His original intention was: I cannot not know other people's hatred of me; I am dissatisfied with others, but I cannot let others know; I cannot forget people's kindness to me; I cannot but forget my kindness to people.</p>
<p>In today's era of reprinting and selling "Thick Black Philosophy," there are things that can be known, and there are things that cannot be known; there are things to be forgotten, and there are things that cannot be forgotten.</p>
<p>Pretend to be deaf and mute to other people's hatred of me, things that cannot be known; my hatred of people, wanting to put them to death, things that can be known; remembering little of others' kindness, things to be forgotten; speaking about my kindness to people whenever I meet them, things that cannot be forgotten.</p>
<p>Who is it that says, "Wuji respectfully receives your teaching" as Tang Ju did?</p>
<p>The Duke of Windsor abandoned the throne for love. This is the most triumphant citation by those who advocate "unconditional love." But these are all past events.</p>
<p>Some women use the other party's status, reputation, and wealth as conditions. In fact, these conditions are just the price of "selling themselves."</p>
<p>"Rosy cheeks and white hair set off each other beautifully," which is precisely the result of multiple transactions opened or secondarily concluded in the love market.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Huating (Part Two)</h3>

<p>—An Introduction to Martyred Journalists</p>
<p>He could get colleagues who liked to be alone to go to the street with him, half-reluctantly; he could get friends who were taciturn to open up to him, whether they wanted to or not. If two people were feeling suffocated in a room, as soon as he arrived, those two friends would be like withered weeds, covered with morning dew, not growing immediately, but with hope of revival.</p>
<p>He was like yeast in friendship, which could make a bun benefit from his action; tall, fluffy, vigorous, and full of vitality; he could also make a steamer of steamed buns be pushed by him, the steam was steaming, and they collectively exerted themselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, at any most important time or occasion, with his few words, he could make the stubborn become honest and the cowardly become upright; the passive become active, and those who sat up rise up and act. He could not only speak, but also do. Whether it was coughing, talking and laughing, a gesture, or a footstep, they were all manifestations of his whole body's vitality.</p>
<p>Because of this, Huating hated evil like an enemy and never compromised. What his heart hated, he often gnashed his teeth, and his expression was stern. Not only did he show it in his face, he simply wanted to resort to force. Those who understood him naturally didn't care, but because he was too straightforward and lacked restraint, he was finally taken advantage of by his enemies, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>Like other patriotic martyrs, Huating did not engage in production during his lifetime, and he was very impoverished after his death. No one supported his wife and children. Five years ago, he played the main role in a tragedy. Who knew that five years later, the national victory he had hoped for had long been achieved, but his family is still shrouded in dark clouds and gloom; the government's commendation and society's respect cannot stop the crying of his children or break through the cold atmosphere. They still have no source of funds for even the simplest living and educational expenses.</p>
<p>A few weeks before Huating's death, one day, he said to Langxuan with great emotion, "My children are young, what will they live on if something happens to me?" Another day, he sat alone at his writing desk, and for no reason, he wrote dozens of "family education" characters horizontally and vertically on paper. Huating was naturally optimistic and full of courage in life. He usually didn't know what melancholy and depression were. These two things can be said to be the subconscious expression of his inner self. We can easily imagine his mood at the time.</p>
<p>Can we completely lower the curtain on Huating's tragedy so that his children can be immersed in the glory of their father's sacrifice for the country, while avoiding being the objects of worry that their father was worried about while he was still alive?</p>
