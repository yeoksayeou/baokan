<h3>蘇所提對日和會照會我國覆文送達蘇方重申立塲盼早開預備會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕我政府對蘇聯十一月廿七日關於召開對日和約之照會之覆文，已於四日晨王外長約晤蘇聯代辦費德林時，當面送致。據權威人士語記者，是項覆文之內容，對我立塲並無變更，除重申我國建議各點外，並予以解說，希望對日和約預備會能於可能之基礎上獲得蘇聯及英美之同意支持，俾早日召開。該人士對此一照會之後果如何不欲推測，惟種關於此事，英美及蘇聯已各走極端，我國之意見則持中可行；倘英美及蘇聯必堅持其原有之主張“而不願有所讓步以同意我方提供之可能基礎，渠寬不知復有何種更可使四國一致採擇之途徑。現在倫敦舉行之外長會議，於對德和會重要問題，仍無獲致協議之可能。此等事務實有其相關性。爲求戰爭在法律上完全停止，各大國實應就東西和會問題迅速合作，全面打開僵局。</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦六日電〕外部發言今最向中央社記者稱：關於蘇聯最近建議中英美蘇外長在中國舉行會議討論對日和會問題之照會，英政府尚未致答。</p>
<h3>美緊急援外法案下週付最後表決</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓五日電〕美衆院今日下午完成對五億九千萬緊急援外貸款法案之一般辯論，俟八日各項修正案提出後再付討論，然後於九日付最後表決。今日有十餘各議員（多爲共和黨者）在議席半空甚至某時僅有不足五十名議負之議會中，發表贊成或反對此議案之演說，最後通過於下週中提出對此案之各項修正案。</p>
<p>〔聯合肚華盛頓六日電〕國會領袖今日不顧眾院方面之企岡削减對外援助經費五億九千萬美元運動，堅決主張在下過杪以前通過該案，咨請總統簽署實行。此外，副國務卿羅維特昨日宣稱：目前法國與義大利之罷工係共產黨所指使，足見蘇聯外交政策業已擴張，美國人民切勿畏縮，致中共產黨之計。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕尚待美國會通過之六千萬緊急救濟，此間金融界人士對其作用之估計，認爲上海全部商業銀行之存款總額約爲一萬八千億，六千萬元分成三期撥付，每期之款項如折合美金黑市計算，即超過上海存款總和，對於物個自有極大作用，至少陰暦年關之漲風可因之而無形消弭。綜合言之，緊急救濟如全部用以平定物價，必能有良好反　，但如用於軍事，則又當別論矣。關於改革幣制所需之基金，各方有不同之估計，其中高低出入甚大，據上述人士之看法，認爲此事之心理因素關係最大，只需美政府能表明決心，積極採取行動，則改革幣制基金雖只二三億美元，但人心安定，我國逃避海外之外匯頭寸及僑匯，可望收回大部份，則改革幣制即有成功之可能。</p>
<h3>生活雜誌社論支持援華要求</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約五日電〕生活雜誌頃於每週社論中，列論美對華政策及其對美政黨政治之關係，文中支持共和黨領袖援華之要求。並謂，美對華政策，應與在其他各地牽制極權侵略之政策，採取同一步調。該雜誌認爲馬歇爾對華三億元緊急援助之建議，係模糊緩慢，且不適當。社論中稱，國務院忙於處理援歐計劃之際，中國共產黨藉西伯利亞並經旅順大連運至共區製造之槍枝，已霸据東北之大部及華北之一半，並使此等省份成爲「僅次於蘇聯之世界第二共產區」。文中繼問曰：「如蘇聯戰略家能在同時顧及兩個或兩個以上之戰錢，則何以美國不能爲此。該社論希望立即恢復援助獨立之中國。文中又曰：美國之遲遲不見行動與共產黨之厚利，已使援華問題成爲中國生死存亡之要務，故目前最緊要者，爲政策之確定，俾便援助能確切生效，而使蔣全席贏得戰爭，且不使美國遺棄其舊日之盟友。</p>

<p>〔本報南京六日電〕經統府組織法之組織原則，尚在當局研討中，當局並榮就總統府成立及國府委會解散後府委之出路，予以研討。若干人士認爲，府委參加推進憲政，勳勞卓著，不應在行憲開始即將其擯棄，故按情理說，應予安置。另說則擬組元老院，惟元老之地位應係屬於總統之高級顧問，以不拘形式，不掌實權之身份，襄助總統解決國家重耍問題，其是否屬於總統府內，則不得而知。</p>
<h3>立院辯論郵資案　最後表決建議政府送院審查　通過提高法定利率案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕立法院六日晨九時舉行第三四一次例會，孫兼院長科主席·務書畏樓桐孫宣讀報告事項中之國府特許政院隨時調整郵資案時，即引起激烈之辨論，歷時甚久·其後通過下列各案：　修正　政條例第廿九條條文案。　興辦水利事業獎勵條例案。　修正自衛槍枝管理條例案。　修正淮河，黃河，長江，華北珠江等五水利工程局名稱，並將各該組織條例中有關會計人事各條文予以修正案。　修正經濟部工業試騐所組織條例第一條條文案。　通過國家銀行職員任免條例。　提高法定利率案。至十二時散會。（利率管理條例全文，修正鹽政條例第廿九條條文，修正自衛槍枝管理條例第三·五·六·九條條文，分刊二版二·三·四欄）</p>
<p>〔又電〕立院六日例會中，提出有關調整郵電資費之報告一項，竟引起一小時四十五分鐘之辯論，最後表決通過王委員培仁等之動議，對國務會議之特許政院隨時調整郵電資費案，表示異議，建議增加郵資，仍須送立院審議。</p>
<h3>委員紛起發言</h3>
<p>該案係〔國民政府為國務會　決議，在動員戡亂期間，特許行政院隨時調整郵電資　，令仰本院知照案」。樓桐孫秘書長宣讀後，委員劉持平首先發難，指摘政府侵犯立院職權，以命令變更法律爲不合法。孫兼院長當即說明國務會議通過該案之經過。各委員繼起發言者逾二十人，紛對本案提出意見。</p>
<p>關於調整郵資事，在立法院中，此爲最近一次擬調整郵資之第二次討論·第一次係政院爲便於自動調整郵資，請修正郵政法第四條關於附表郵資之規定，以後郵資調整，即不必經由立法院審談。該案由國府交立院核議後，當遭否決，各委員咸以事關增加人民負擔，堅持仍應由立法院通過，郵政法第四條條文毋庸修改。政院以郵電虧損實因物價波動日增，調整郵資原爲避免補貼虧損，並謀權利義務之對稱，避免少數人使用郵電，由國家貼補賞無增加全民負担，過去郵電資費調整，迨至完成立法程序，歷相當時日，物價續漲，虧損仍難彌補，因決定再請國府特許政院隨時調整價格。國務會議於第十六次會中通過，當令立院知照。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕國府六日令：　國代立委廣東省選舉事務所主委羅　英應予免職，　派宋子文為國代立委廣東省選舉事務所主委，　國代立委廣東省選舉事務所選舉委會委員　朝陽，應予免職，　派徐景唐為國代立委選舉事務所選舉委會委員。</p>

<h3>悼俞頌華先生</h3>
<p>— 舒新城</p>
<p>當十月十二日在上海報紙上看到俞頌華先生在蘇州逝世消息的時候風不禁嘆息著：我的好朋友又弱一個了。我這樣嘆息過的，在近年來已有很多的次數：六七年前的蔣百里先生，陸費伯鴻先生，去年的陶行知先生，何柏丞先生，今年的常燕生先生：他們逝世，我每次都有這樣的嘆息。我這種嘆息不獨感傷逝者，並因年齡相當的朋友一個一個地死去而感到自己有孤獨之悲：同時更以爲這些朋友逝去的時候，年齡都未滿六十，從解剖學和心理學上歷程看，他們的精神力尚未發展到極點，正是大有爲的時候，都是不應死的而竟死去，明擺著是精神生命的中途摧折。病夫國之形成，固已是國家社會的損失，而此種精神生命的中途摧折，其損失則尤不可償。頌華先生之死和其他諸位之死，我以爲都是國家社會慘遭損失的指數。倘若我們沒有方法減少精神生命的中途摧折，或者竟不知他也逝世是一種摧折，則嘆息又有何用。</p>
<p>頌華先生與我訂交，是在民國九年，他任「解放與改造」主編的時候。那時我們都很年青，我於九年夏初到上海，在時事新報初次唔談，彼此都有相見恨晚之感。以後我在川，湘，蘇，浙，皖，鄂各省敎書講學，他則始終不離新聞記者的崗位，就是出國就學與考察，也是以新聞事業爲主題。以後，我們見面的時候雖不多，但常藉文字以互通消息，交誼且日益加深。民國十九年我以任職中華遷居上海，他則服務申報，相聚之時間較多。八一三事起後，他轉職星加坡，我則常去香港，他也因事至香港數次，我們在港也不時相遇。我約他在香港中華書局分局樓上談開的一個上午。那天是星期日，我們約定不約他們參加，便可自由談話。除去彼此互告個人生活及對事業之理想外，凡世界大勢，國內局勢，無不自由談及。我們都逆料日本必發動世界大戰，而爲紙上談兵地擬定許多「文化國防」的計劃。不料第二日的清早，香港的飛機塲已爲日軍佔領，而太平洋戰事眞的發生了。自此以後，彼此不通音問者又數年。今年春我應蘇州國立社會敎育學院已約，爲其電化敎育系講授電影課程，姑悉他早已任該院之新聞系主任。我兩週去蘇一次，他在四月前養病上海，雖爲同事而仍未見面。直到五月間，我因陪國聯文敎處參事胡懋儀及美國百科全書影片公司經理史偉志去蘇參觀，多去蘇州幾次，始於該院敎授宿舍中和他作幾度長談。我在三十一年至三十三年之間曾大病幾死，對於中年以上之人的健康特別重視，對於病苦也有特殊體騐。每次唔談，都覺得他的身體虧損太甚，非有絕對的長期靜養不易恢復，而勸其摒除一切，專心休養；他仍對校事負責如故，在五月學潮正盛的時候，學生罷課，他仍孜孜不倦地指導一切。此後我未來去蘇，不幸他竟於十月十一日與世長辭了。</p>
<p>頌華先生已死，他對國家社會的貢獻，大家都知道，　澄先生的傳略也說得詳細，我不必再說。我所感嘆的是他正當精神能力的壯年期，他的精神力據解剖學及心理研究的結果，還可說是未成熟——人的精神能力要到六十歲方完全成熟——而竟也隨蔣，陸費，陶，何，常諸先生而死，我以爲國家社會以及個人的各方面都應當有所警惕。在個人方面，現代治科學的人都努力於研究控制自然及社會的方法，而怎樣控制自身則獨從忽略。從生物學上看，人類的自然壽命，應爲生理成熟年齡的五倍，則人的自然死亡期應爲一百歲至一百二十五歲；即美國人的平均壽命，至去年也已達到六十歲另三。我國社會的優秀學者如蔣，陶，保，常及頌華先生，優秀事業家如陸費先生等，乃至述　國人的平均壽命的年齡都還達不到，自己的飲食起居不盡合健康之道，甚至於無意或無暇去研究與個人壽命有關的問題當不免是一個原因。其實另一方面，社會如此動　，經濟如此紊亂，國家社會對學者的生活如此無保障，使他們平日爲生活忙，爲油米柴鹽忙，爲兒女敎育費忙；等到忙出病來，則既元免費休養的設施，還要於日常生活費用之外，愁慮著醫藥費的開支。在這種情形之下，他們也不過是血肉做的人，又怎禁得起如此的摧折。</p>
<p>頌華先生以及我的許多朋友都在精神力尚未成熟的時期死了。我們不獨爲朋友誌悼，同時也爲國家社會嘆息。我們悼頌華先生，同時希望未死的個人以及國家當局社會事業當局深深警惕：警惕著人才不易，如何預籌減除令人早死的因緣，不再令蹈頌華先生等之覆轍。那就不但未死人才之幸，實也是掌握國家社會者不可逃避的職責。</p>

<h3>立法院辯論</h3>
<p>（上接一版）</p>
<p>三種不同意見　今日討論時，各委員發言者，類分三種意見：第一種意見爲主張由立院補足程序，製定決議案，規定在動員戡亂期間，關於郵電資費，得由行政院隨時調整之。具此主張者有陳顧元，陳洪，陳海澄，鍾天心，黃右昌等，其理由爲現在立院非行憲後之立法院，與國民一些人府爲一家，國務會議之決議缺乏法律根據，但事實上郵資非加價不可，立院之反對似難變更國務會議之決議，故應製定決議案，使國務會議之決議有法律根據。陳揚　，陳海澄等</p>
<p>主張於決議案中規定，不得亂行漲價，應顧及人民負担。第二種意見如持反對論者，有劉持平，左恭，王毓祥，狄膺，　九　，張邦翰，夏爾康，王塔仁，李慶　，譚惕吾，柳克述等，渠等認爲國務會議決議，　以命令變更法律，原郵政法第四條既不停止　行，此次決議適　　　　，郵資加價中國人民普遍　　。立院　　緘口下言。　　　　　　時日是，　各委員一　　　古　。而立法委員　　　民對　　增　　。　　日　出民主　　　，民　　　在立院　　重立院意見，　　，著　委員認爲政府　　。立院　　代替委員。更下必爲之　　。第三種意見則爲不必有　　，根本不表示意見。作此主張者有陳菇玄，鄧公立等。</p>

<h3>人口劇減，失業增加　貧困寂寞的大連</h3>
<p>美駐大連總領貝甯荷夫談實情</p>
<p>「美國新聞處華盛頓五日電」國務院今日宣稱：美國駐大連總領事貝甯荷夫將不重返任所，而將獲一新職。貝甯荷夫係於五週前返回華盛頓，美國在蘇聯佔領下之東三省「自由港」之事務，現暫由副總領事巴區代理。</p>
<p>貝甯荷夫在今日接見記者時，曾說明此一曾爲重要運輸中心之大連，現已完全麻痹，而大量減少之人口中，並到處發現飢餓，疾病以及痛苦。貝甯荷夫本人在執行其日常工作之一切行動中，曾遭遷極度之困難。</p>
<p>就技術上言，在一九四五年八月十四日中蘇協定之下，大連名義上乃係一對所有國家開放國際商衆之自由港口，惟貝甯備夫稱：「雖然如此，捨此東三省主要海港以外。更未有鐵幕深重如此可怖者。」　　美國旅客不准進入，美國商業亦不存在，而美國在該地之財產一度曾達二百尤美元。</p>
<p>國務院於八月間曾正式重申其先期於一月間所作之請求，即希望蘇聯將此海港開放以供貿易。八月間之照會略稱：「自從日本投降以來，雖已兩年，大連仍未向世界貿易開放，而美國商號之代表亦未獲准佔有甚至訪問其長久以來爲其所有之城市郊外之財產。」貝甯荷夫並稱：「大連人口現僅爲一九四五年一百三十尤人之半數，由於鐵路被切斷，港口封鎖，唯一之運輸係中國之漁船及蘇聯往返與蘇聯港口間運輸軍物資之船隻。」</p>
<p>衛生情況惡劣傷寒天花流行</p>
<p>「到處均見失業，貧困正在增加，一度熱鬧之街道現已冷寂，若干商店均已關閉。</p>
<p>蘇聯佔領軍控制一切，附近有三萬至五萬警備車。旅行本市十哩半徑以內之地區，設非獲准即被禁止，所獲准旅行乃屬困難。</p>
<p>醫藥極少，水之供給亦不足，衛生情況甚劣。在其居留大連期間，霍亂，傷寒，天花等均甚流行。</p>
<p>物價極高，故領館人員悉賴罐頭食物生活。渠個人之最難問題，即需於「眞空」中從事每日工作，幾與世界其他地區隔離而完全孤立。蘇聯數月來迄仍拒絕中國無綫電員入境，總領事之電訊僅可藉蘇聯通信機構維持。</p>
<p>貝甯荷夫新職可能赴日工作</p>
<p>「中財社華盛頓五日電」美國務院今宣稱：月前返美與不局有所會商之美駐大連總領事貝甯荷夫或將調任他職，繼任人選尚未發表。按貝甯荷夫精通日文，故據測渠可能改派至日本工作。</p>

<p>〔合衆肚華盛頓五日電〕代理國務鄉羅維特五日談稱：蘇聯正在法國及處大利促動罷工及騷動，企國「威嚇」美國放棄其援歐計劃。渠告參院撥款委員會稱：工潮表面上係法國及義大利本地共黨所發動，事實上此顯然係「蘇聯外交政策之擴張」。自美國會於十一月中旬國會以考慮一緊急救濟計劃給與法，義，奧三國以還，羅維特第一正式將法雜兩國國內之罷工工潮及騷動諉諸於蘇聯。渠述及工潮時稱：你等不能不予理睬，蓋工潮之發生正值國會開會，小組委員會開始工作，及四強外長在倫敦會議之時。渠　請委員會撥款，以實行美國緊急冬季救濟計劃。若干方面吾人不得不決定吾人之生張，若吾人欲從事研究此事，不爲此種罷工所嚇退。</p>

<h3>統一德國政治經濟　馬歇爾提出建議　主撤佔區界綫物資交流</h3>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦六日電〕擄悉馬歇爾與貝文六日將再度努力促使莫洛托夫放棄其立塲，而開始商討德國問題。馬歇爾將迫使莫洛托夫答覆蘇聯是否仍以德國之一百億賠款，爲統一德國經濟之條件，如蘇聯仍加堅持，則從速獲致協議之希望頗渺茫矣。另一方面莫洛托夫或亦將請英美答糧，英美是否仍計劃在西德成立分裂政府，抑或能公開宣佈放棄此計劃。愈信此爲目前僵局之重要關鍵，如未能加以打開，則本屆外長會議亦將步前次莫斯科會議之後塵覆轍。此間盛傳馬歇爾已在收拾行囊，準備在一週內返國。馬歇爾左右否認此說，謂四外長纔涉及德國問題之中心也。</p>

<h3>市商會電呈政府　審愼辦理經濟措置　合理修正禁止通滙不宜封鎖貸款門戶</h3>
<p>上海市商會對此次政府之經濟戡亂措置，認爲行之稍欠精審，即不免於因噎廢食，特電呈政府呼籲審愼辦理，庶不以偶發性之事實，礙及正常之經濟發展，其要點略調：上海猶爲輕工業比較發展，民生日用品之集散中心，匯款來滬採辦貨物，此爲都市經濟與農村生活，互相依存之必然現象，當局如不揣其本，一概施以堵截政策，雖正當行莊停止收匯，而私設機構，仍可暗通往來，甚者以貨物之單帮，變爲資金之單帮，於政策並未實澈，徒自减少行莊之正當業務，爲淵驅魚，使游資更投向黑市，必使金融愈趨騷動不安。而况內地資金若不獲匯出，作正當運用，安能保其不在當地囤購穀物，壟斷原料，循至農產品居奇頻漲，供需失衡，與都市物價相互激還，愈演愈烈，以平價政策之專注一隅，其禍患反致牽動全局，此在戰時大後方，已飽經敎訓，奚堪重演。擬請將目前禁止匯款之措置，予以合理修正。又現在正當農產物收穫之時，工商業進購物料，需要貸款，至爲殷切，年來商業行莊資力薄弱，全恃國家行局之挹注，而最近四聯總處又停止國家行局之放款，輾轉相仍，將使行莊益求謹愼自保，非特新放者不敢承做，即已放者亦將如期收回，則工商業之融通途徑，勢將愈縮愈隘，迫使趨向黑市，尋求高利貸款，其爲阻遏生產，助長物價，不言可喻。故對於正當工商貸款之門戶，似不宜概予對鎖，以免變本加厲，致經濟緊急措施發生相反之惡果云云。</p>
<h3>重訂房捐徵收率財政局未加考慮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市房捐徴收辦法，係根據民國二十六年估值之一百八十倍，徴收百分之五。中央方面，認爲上項徴收方式極不合理，因房租業已上漲甚鉅，房捐徴收率亦應以現行房租爲準繩，財政部曾囑市府重行擬訂房捐徴收辦法。惟據財政局長田永謙昨向託者表示：財部辦法在執行上實有困難，因戶主未必貨將實際房租呈報當局，故上述辦法，財局尚未加以考慮。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕前郵匯總局局長徐繼莊等被控貪汚案，其中牽涉振業銀行常務　事程天如，討警局認爲有陰匿人犯嫌疑，該案刻在地檢處偵查中，昨日程具狀地檢處對此有所申辨。據辯訴狀略謂：該案發生於上月十四日夜七時許，渠因應張耀廣律師之邀，赴泰安路二十二號研究關於徐繼莊案之辯護律師公費問題，是時突有便衣人員進內，聲言係檢查戶口，因不知對方身份，故不免有驚惶失措之處，渠係乘「一三六九〇」號汽車而來，此時停於門外，恐汽車被人劫奪，故以手示意，招呼汽車開走，嗣便衣人員指明渠爲徐繼莊，經核對照片後方知錯誤，至此，始知對方係警局人員，事實上泰安路二十二號僅有一門，假如徐繼莊在內，根本無法逃出，故徐繼莊之未能拘獲，根本與渠無關，列爲被告之一，殊覺寃抑云。</p>

<h3>江西紅土絕人烟磁器街頭無磁器戈陽到南昌</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌四日航訊〕江西省境的東面，自弋陽以上，鐵路遠沒有修復，必須用汽車走公路前行，當渡過信江以後，簡直是滿目荒凉。江西著名的紅土上，出着高達尺許的紅毛草，數十里內無人烟。到坐峯，見怪石嶙峋，遠處有一些紅葉樹和綠色樹，近貴溪，已有百餘戶人家在望，貴溪大橋正在上梁建造。從這一路到鷹潭，差不多有將近五十多公里的路程，但在零足散佈在荒野的田酸，尤其那炸剩的半截房屋，是以紅石砌成，更有一種說不出的感覺。</p>
<p>交叉點土貨集散地</p>
<p>鷹潭是信江和浙贛路的交叉點，是永陸交通的要道，江西的米和磁器的集散地，相當重要的地方，我們亟願她能慢慢地恢復起來。</p>
<p>車過騰潭，那荒凉的情形似較好些了，有很多土地，也已生產，也有農家牽着三四頭牛在田間工作。過東鄉看來，只有百分之三十是荒地了，村落處處，紅葉長遍在漫山漫野。到下埠集，田間多已收穫，熟地相當的多，滿角落的紅葉，雜着深綠的樹枝而生着，愈顯得蒼勁有力。進賢以上，地又荒起來了，不過公路爲一直綫，到臨川還是一直綫，約摸有十五公里的長。</p>
<p>梁家渡大橋重建中</p>
<p>梁家渡口，這是扶河的幹流，河面　寬，當年鐵路在此築有梁家渡大橋，撤退時曾炸一次，後見敵未來，再炸一次，最後又炸一次。敵人來時也炸一次，所以這座大橋的破壞，可謂最爲徹底。現在，經過浙贛路第二區大橋工程處處長黃壽益的努力，又已在興建十四孔，每孔三十五公尺的鋼板梁大橋，每孔像這樣長度的大橋，在中國還是第一次。此橋本擬用鋼板梁，而該項鋼板須於明年由加拿大　來，故由黃處長設計將打撈起來炸毀了的鋼板梁，選擇其好的，加以接長。黃處長曾領我們去看工塲，他們都很緊張的在工作着。</p>
<p>南昌市　看市政文化</p>
<p>到南昌已是夜幕罩下來的時候，那不平坦的市區的馬降，黯淡的街燈，破壞了又重還需要時間與努力。</p>
<p>南昌市，有二十六萬四千五百多人口，論江西全省，則有一千三百七十多萬人口，江西的面積要比羅建與浙江，江蘇都大，而人口却比不上，江，浙，　三省，無怪荒蕪不堪了。</p>
<p>南昌有國立中正大學，他們在望城坡上諜，距城要有十一公里的路程，有文。理。法•工•農，五院，學生有一千三百多人，圖書僅二萬册，儀器也不多。其他還有體育專門學校，　樂專門學校，還有一所圖書館，內有綫裝書五萬册，普通閱覽一萬</p>
<p>我們曾去介石公園•百在洲去玩，那百花洲是在東湖的中央，地方上人說，湖永是臭的，問他們爲什麼不　濬，他們說沒有綫。</p>
<p>佑民寺　前朝的影事</p>
<p>道裏有一所歷史悠久的寺院，名呌佑民寺，裹面有一尊銅佛，老和尚說重十萬八千斤，高一丈六尺，相傳鑄於五代梁武帝時，當時此寺稱爲大佛寺，唐時改稱永寗寺，明時改稱佑明，淸時改稱佑淸，民時改稱佑民，這倒是一件很有趣味的故事。明朝時寗王宸濠曾在此謀叛，其妻婁妃阻之不聽，遂剪髮大書「翰屏」兩字而後自盡，婁妃墓至今猶留於贛江之畔，與貧苦人民爲伍。墓容寥落，牌坊僅存柱子幾根，石獅子已折腿伏地。</p>
<p>中正橋　募款興修中</p>
<p>著名的滕王閣，也已蕩然無存，衹有一境右額尚遺留在磁器街的滕王閣小學內。在小學隔壁的水警總隊部內，還能找到幾塊柱子的石圓凳。而磁器街上，一片磁器店都找不到。一　南昌的名勝古蹟都很殘落，那長達一公里的中正橋，破敗異常。聽說地方上人，正募款興修中。</p>
<p>南昌的磁器店有三四十家，大宗的買賣還在九江。米買四十萬元一担，比較起來還算便宜。不過，老百姓沒有大宗的生產方法，還顯得很窮困。今年的年成，早稻有八成，晚稻有六七成，這是　東的情形。</p>
<p>造大橋　修復大動脈</p>
<p>在南昌，我們又碰到浙贛路第三橋工程處處長歐陽誠。他要我們去參觀贛江大橋的工程，我們因為時間所限，不能前去，不過贛江大橋是浙贛全路的唯一大橋，在江西這樣地廣人稀的現時代，又在浙贛路這樣窮苦的情形下，他們急忙地想修復這條動脈，來復蘇江西，這精神是值得欽佩的。（特派員儲裕生）</p>

<h3>英國足球的起源（中）</h3>
<p>— 樂秀榮</p>
<p>同年（一八六三）十一月，在原地舉行第二次會議。足球會第一任會長潘勃爾氏Arhur　Pember主席，第一任書記學萊E.C.Morley報告，他正努力進行得到各主要學校的合作。他希望大家能採用大會的規則，「如此可以安排各球會間的比賽，因爲有許多新生的球會，就要產生」。</p>
<p>會議初期的大部份時間，是在集中和比較各球會的不同規則，而來制定一部可爲大眾接受的「足球規則」•經過熱烈的商討辭論，在一八六三年十一月二十四日，一部規則草案是成功了。</p>
<p>第一個表示接受這不規則的，是吉泰的皇家工程師足球會，這球會在英國足球杯賽的初期，佔着很軍要的地位。</p>
<p>這部規則並不獲得普遍的接受，後來劍橋大學足球會供獻一部規則，用最簡單的方法來包括許多足球賽的要點，所以有繼續會商的必要。十三條原始規則，都受了更動，到一八六三年十二月一日，正式產生了英國式球會的是球規則。這一天是因果足球會歷史可紀念的一天，從此該會能發揮他的功用，成為一個管理足球賽的機關，安排各個球會間的比賽。</p>
<p>最初幾年，都是友誼比賽，到后開淘汰比賽已有顯然的需要。英國足球會就創始舉辦這歷史性的「因果足球會卻令治杯賽」FA．Challenge　Cup，（按此杯賽至今英國每年舉行）</p>

<h3>國產棉花供應紗廠需求　本年僅缺二百萬擔　大致可取給於美棉貸欵</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市紡織及棉業界某權威，昨就我國目前原棉產銷及棉紗生產現狀，對我國需要原棉數址，作確切之佔計。據談：本年度棉季（自本年九月　明年八月底），原估計可收皮棉六百萬担。茲以軍事影響，故估計實收額，已减至五百萬担。此五百萬担中，目前各廠已收購到手者，已達一百五十萬担。如目前軍事情勢維持不變，則至”年新花上市前止，至少尚可收足三百五十萬担，兩共五百萬担。如再打除攙雜一百萬担，則未年度實際收購之皮花，估計可達四百萬担。果如目前軍事情熟進步，則收購量尚有增加希望。</p>
<p>本年度棉季內，全國棉紗之生產最，預定目標爲各支紗而百萬件。茲以停電减不等阻碍，估計本年度最高產址，約爲一百七十萬件。依每件需棉四百斤計，則全年共需原棉約近七百萬担。與國內可能之供棉景四百萬担相衡，約短缺三百萬担。</p>
<p>茲姑將各廠原有存棉及聯總棉花等，均作存棉，不以抵充缺額。所缺之三百萬担皮花，全年紗布產量十分之一外銷，約可換回棉花一百萬担，故實缺棉花額，僅約二百萬担，合四十餘萬包。</p>
<p>據關係方面透露：此四十萬包棉花，大致將取給於將近成熟之　棉貸款。美大使館是務參贊陶森氏日來曾與本市棉紡界首腦，交換意見，徵詢需要美棉織種類。按我國日前可資收購之原棉，大多爲廿支紗以下之原料。故對該四十餘萬包之外棉，常需以細絨原料爲主體。據專家估計：大致需八分之七時者廿萬包，一時及一時以上者各十萬包，方能與收購之國棉，共同配合目動國內紡織業之需要云。</p>

<p>棉布市况，以紡建開售細布，均爲低檔，掛牌配價又予提高，市塲情勢頗形悄俐，消息利買，新買活動，同業抵補亦殷，價迂迴向上。迨至收市，十二磅龍頭細布昂至一百廿三萬元，比上日回漲三萬，但收後買氣仍濃，塲外再見喊高廿三萬八千元有人買進，另外各檔細布亦升二萬五至四萬元，其餘各布市盤亦均見挺升。</p>

<h3>「發言人」</h3>
<p>— 靖文</p>
<p>過去的從政者，都好遵守「爲政不在多言」的訓條，爲的是「民可使由之，不可使知之」，一方面也可藉此「廠拙」，免得找許多麻煩。</p>
<p>現在是民主時代，「不可使知之」的辦法自然是行不通的了。要講民主，第一先要啓迪民智。而啓迪民智云云，用現代的政治學的術語講，就呌做宣傳。於是就產生了大大小小機關的「發言人」。</p>
<p>據心理學家的分析，人的性情因所受心理影響的不同（有的說是因內分泌的不同），有所謂內向性與外向性的分別。但無論是內向性或外向性，其好名則一。所謂好名，用現代語法解，就是要別人「瞭解」你的好處。「三代以下無不好名」，所以宣傳這件事，雖說是民主時代的產物，却也是由來久矣。</p>
<p>宣傳旣不是壞事情，「發言人」的地位當然是値得尊敬的；無論你所發的言是代表你自己，或是代表你的職務，祇要你言之成理，更重要的是言之有物，你便盡了「發言人」的責任。</p>
<p>然而，好的事情，一到別有用心者的手中，往往就變得面目全非了。宣傳的目的旣在啓迪民智，第一自然應避免說謊。可是那位服毒自殺的希特勒的「發言人」戈倍爾，生前却銳過這樣的話：「不斷反覆的謊言，也會變成眞理」。換句話說，你把一個謊話說之再三，人家就會接受之為事實的。</p>
<p>將宣傳當做說謊的工具，是何等的荒謬。不過為欺瞞羣衆於一時，把說謊看做宣傳要義，也許是必要的。然而納粹終於在向世界的大撤謊中失敗了。</p>
<p>話歸正題，宜傳的本身意義，雖是無可厚非，但是也許因爲大家把這工具用得太濫了，所以在看到一些不可靠的言諭，或吹噓過甚的廣吿時，總說祗不過是「宜傳宣傳吧了」。言下之意，倒好像萬事一有宜傳色彩，就等於不可置信。這豈不是和宣傳的本　差得太遠了嗎？</p>
<h3>閒話聊齋誌異之類</h3>
<p>— 思果</p>
<p>「聊齋誌異」的文字不能算不美，結構好的只有完好的短篇小說中才有，但我曾經懷疑以蒲留仙那樣高明的文筆，什麼文字不好寫而偏去談狐說鬼。這事直等到我接觸到心理分析的學說，才找到了一些根源。聊齋及其類似的著作正有多種的心理背景，可以提出來硏究的。</p>
<p>首先，我們可以想像得到一個窮畫痴對異性的好奇心是不見得遜於任何人的。蒲留仙那時天主敎的聖潔觀念還未普遍，慣於做白日夢的文人在社會不重視男人貞操而男女交際又不公開的情况之下，如何發洩心中的苦悶，實在是很嚴重的。在這種情况之下寫狐鬼艷遇，正如小孩駡人「小狗」就像看見那人是小狗一般，心中可以滿足一下；雖然空虛，却也發洩了。所以才人如蒲留仙便藉了傳說把善變的（特別變成美女）狐狸拿來解決他的苦悶情緒。狐與鬼給他頂大的便利和滿足；因爲她們夜間才出現，不會被人撞見，而且沒有父兄本夫出面控吿他有傷風化和妨害家庭等等罪名，幹了風流事也不犯王法的。而狐鬼因無物質欲望，不比當時名妓閨秀，她們只揀風流才子，不計對方的名望和金錢，而且不管書痴如何怕羞，她們自己會來。眞是天下便宜事，未有甚於此者矣！老學究倘若白天看見了貌美的（其實未必美，也許學究近視看不明）鄰女，回家無法自遺，做幾首艷詩綺詞還不够，可以再來一篇鬼話。</p>
<p>從哲學方面講，人生本是苦痛，現在有了鬼狐，苦痛也不用害怕了。但看老年可以還童，分離的可以立刻見面，心中的愛侶可以無條件地和她結合……便明白了。文學旣許人們自由想像，自然不能拒絕人寫狐鬼。西洋文學中也有神話，和這個是有部份相似的。</p>
<p>狐鬼旣是萬能，在這黑暗的社會裏自然地就成了偸富濟貧，除暴安良的俠士了。道和武俠小說通行是出於同一原因。再以佛敎輪迴之說本來深入民間，讀書之士悲天憫人，或看不慣貪官汚吏，土豪劣紳，便寄託了無限希望在鬼狐身上了。他們耍警誡壞人，便渲染果報；要洩義憤，便寫壤人得着壞結果。效果如何且不談，至少動機和傳敎是相像的，就是補王化之不足。這也可見中國的士人是不能積極做事，只能消極「勸善」罷了。</p>
<p>讀書的人不肯做積極的事，也有其困難存在。像淸代朝廷對漢人的猜忌使人刻刻想苟全性命，　禍的心理籠單了每一個文人，滿腹的話要說不能痛快地說，只有談狐鬼了。皇帝對指陳政事得失甚至鼓吹新事物雖不高興，但對於談荒　不經的事有時不但不反對，反而覺得有趣。順便可以說的是淸代的老據之學也是在避禍的心理之下有了偉大成就的。</p>
<p>談鬼狐不但可以避禍，還可以借題發揮去駡人。在西洋文學中像格利佛遊記就是諷刺的，但紀曉嵐駡宋儒的工具却是鬼。</p>
<p>這類作品應該比霍亂更容易流傳，因爲牠們正合人們的胃口。能寫文的就要寫，不能寫的就讓。人的才能在這類作品上找到了出路，一方面又是快意而無害，難怪繼　留仙的人多了。</p>
<h3>召盤</h3>
<p>— 樂</p>

<h3>天才</h3>
<p>— 李雨文</p>
<p>一個年靑的母親和她的小孩站在一條街角上，她的手從孩子的肩頭指着一個坐在汽車中的男人說：「這就是亞伯，愛因斯坦（Albert　Einstein），不要忘記了，你會經看見過他。」</p>
<p>她指出來的是一個矮胖小個子，有着一付莊嚴的面孔和一頭濃密的白髮，他就是無人不知的當代大科學家，相對論的發明者，原子時代之父，並且也是一個幽默，友愛，坦白，謙和，樸質的人。</p>
<p>有很多故事談到愛因斯坦，這里就是其中的幾個，由這里可以充分說明爲何愛因斯坦這個人長久的爲人們贊頌。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦的家在品斯頓，是一間樸素的二屏樓房屋，但有一次也被裝置了升降梯的設備。有一位朋友聽見這笨生意居然成功了，就去問他：「天曉得，亞伯，爲什麼你也去裝上一個電梯呢？」</p>
<p>「我也不知這，」愛因斯坦回答，「祇是那位攬生意的先生是那樣的和氣，以致於我不能拒絕了！」</p>
<p>愛因斯坦的隣居有一位小姑娘，和　位大數學家變得十分友好，差不多每天下午都去看他，小姑娘的母親覺得廳怪了，便跑去問這位敎授他們到底在談些什麼。</p>
<p>「哦」，愛因斯坦回答，「她天天送餅給我吃，呌我就替她做算術習題。」</p>
<p>有一次愛因斯坦被邀請去謁見比利時王室的時候，歡迎團體到火車站去迎接他，汽車和司機都預備好了，僕人們也在整理行李，但是他們却找不着愛因斯坦，原來他靜靜地走下火車，提着他的箱子，向皇宮步行而去。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦對這些大驚小怪的人們解釋得很簡單，他說：「我喜歡走路。」</p>
<h3>正氣</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>明史薛瑄傳略云：瑄以進士擢御史，三楊（時楊榮，楊士奇，楊溥俱爲大學士，史稱三楊）欲一面，瑄曰：「茶忝糾劾之任，義無相識。」拒不見。三楊稱歎不已，曰：「薛公見且不得，况得屈乎？」以宰相的威望，欲屈尊去見御史，在普通的人看來，都會引爲無上光榮，而薛公却恐相識以後，難免發生感情，有了感情，便難於糾劾，索興拒而不見，免得將來萬一有糾劾時的左右爲難，其嚴正如此，無怪後世讀史的人歎服不止。又柳南隨筆載；宜興周相國玉繩，少時，從黃介子先生遊，先生極稱之，迨玉繩以高第里居，頗恣縱，先生聞之，弗善也。後玉繩以事謁先生，先生堅臥弗起，迨長跪榻前請過，先生遽起，批其頰曰：「汝初致牙，遂爲患鄕里乎！」其嚴正之氣，正與薛公之拒見三楊先後媲美。余謂此非獨薛黃二公之正氣磅礡四極，即三楊之稱嘆及周之忍痛，俱足爲後世法。至如宋之陳自强，本韓　胄之師，伲宵旣貴，自强倚之，至稱爲「恩王」「恩父」，一則呼之而不知恥，一亦應之而無愧色，卑鄙齷齪，直令人作三日嘔，若以上述二公比之，能不令其愧死耶！</p>
<h3>有鼠來窺閣雜筆　淸末政爭史上之翁李交惡（上）</h3>
<p>— 禹壽</p>
<p>淸昨將滅之四十年間，以滿人多騃不解事，漢臣遂漸得勢，「共糟食者必龁」，黨系之爭自所難免。最著名之一　，則爲光赭中期之翁李交惡。</p>
<p>翁爲常熟翁同龢，李爲高陽李鴻藻（今中委李煜瀛父也）。時同在軍機，皆以能養士健鬥稱，此中人物，在以後數十年間，各有其政治上與著述上之地位，號稱「淸流」，可列表如次，</p>
<p>高陽系</p>
<p>張幼樵（佩綸）</p>
<p>張香濤（之洞）</p>
<p>陳弢庵（寳琛）</p>
<p>黃漱蘭（體芳）</p>
<p>常熟系</p>
<p>盛伯義（昱）</p>
<p>王可莊（仁堪）</p>
<p>沈子培（酋植）</p>
<p>張李直（譽）</p>
<p>文芸閣（廷式）</p>
<p>常熱入軍機，視高陽少晚（爲光緒八年事）時滿王柄政，倚高陽爲胆。顧西后對恭王之觀念已變，常熟知其隱也，則麾所蓄士，首攻高陽，且及恭王。發難者爲所謂宗室名士　華閣主人盛伯羲，於是恭王與其哼哈二將寳鋆李鴻藻，皆一夕罷軍機，（翁亦同時出軍機），偃仆十年不得起。時多疑爲醇王之謀，常熟殆黨於醇，故不恤爲取火中之栗。其實恭李之黜，由於西后個人之感情變化，常熟之攻而得利，會逢其適耳，后固非有愛於常熟系者。觀以後十年，兩系人事並無顯著之進退，而張幼樵且於同年拜會辦福建海疆事宜之命，未嘗因高腸之潰而蜷縮也（馬尾戰敗受譴，是後一年事）。</p>
<p>惟兩系人士，以後各於日記文稿中，相互攻訐，其詞之猥鄙，有類市井惡少（當於下文摘述之），充分暴露中國舊士大夫階級之褊狹頑戾諸惡習。賢如滄趣老人（陳弢庵），所爲感春四律，醜詆常熟，亦復不留餘地，吾人於五十年後讀之，似猶聞其狺狺之聲。</p>
<p>光緒二十年，恭王與高陽皆再起，以其時光緒漸問事，常熟得留不去，而恭王與高陽受挫多年，精悍之氣已失，不復能爲　楚之報。光緒二十二年十一月一日翁常熟日記云：「恭邸請賞李某椅，竟未許。高陽病後，行走極艱，今日入見，掖不能起，余等夾持之，猶立不穩，可慮也。」筆間尙含調侃之意，時爲公曆一八九六年（又半年，高陽始死）。度彼時之李石曾氏，或尙結紅絨小辮，在家墊中讀關關瞧鳩也。</p>
<h3>談牙痛</h3>
<p>— 廣覺</p>
<p>近來又常常牙齒痛，好像回到小的時候了。</p>
<p>小時候歡喜吃糖食，母親不曉得敎我口腔衛生，一嘴巴牙齒蛀得不像樣子。知道牙齒有兩批，起先以爲第一批毀了，第二批一定是好的；不想第一批壞，第二批還是壞。</p>
<p>我換牙的時侯，總是跑到做中醫的外祖父那裏去，向他嘴一張，他就曉得來意，看一看，知這那一顆要拔掉，伸兩個手指進去，捉住那顆毀牙，敎我嗆一聲，我就嗆一聲，嗆聲過去，毀牙在外祖父的手裏了。他照例問一點不痛吧，其實是有一點痛的，但我總說一點不痛。于是祖母敎我；把上排拔下來的牙　丟到禾底下去，把下排拔下來的牙齒拋到屋簷上去，好像這樣一來，以後出來的新牙萬無一失了，結果偏偏不行。</p>
<p>到十來歲，牙齒痛成了老毛病，痛起來，母親只會給我一個生鷄蛋，敎我在面上滾。二十年前，好像在我們那個鄉下，還連頭痛醫頭牙痛醫牙的阿司匹靈都不曾行到。有時候他們敎我拿一粒日本貨的仁丹塞在蛀牙洞裏。開頭很好，過一會就更痛。</p>
<p>在大學裘，又痛了起來，這回自然要請敎什麼留德留日的牙科博士了。一位博士檢査了一番，說是拔一顆，補一顆，大洋十元，我答被應了。這位年輕的博士拔去一顆略蛀而堅强的舊牙，使我至今懷恨在心。他拔的時侯，出了幾身汗，動員了和他合租診室的朋友，女護士們都相顧失色，讓我流了過多的血，回到學校裏，幾乎昏倒在同學的面前。他給我裝的一顆假牙齒箝在兩齒之間，非常之不靈，我率性把它丟了，於是害我上排牙個個稍息向右看齊似的鬆了出來，本來生得不好看的，就此更加不好看了。但是，無論如何，這位博士給我抽神經塡銀粉的一顆，他說可以保三年，事實上到現在已經十四五年了，居然不曾壞。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第二章　娓娓淸談　（七）</p>
<p>朱師傅待我可說眞好，當我親生女兒一般，只有他知道，全吿訴我，我有一點錯處，他必提醒我，絕不肯放鬆。那時我父親自己組班，班內缺少一個二牌旦角，許多人宇張呌我担任，我父親不肯，經朱徐兩位先生力保，才呌我試一試。記得一天晚上，我父親貼的是「戰太平」，上坐八百多人，老人家非常高興，我那天戲碼是一武家坡」排在壓軸，「武家坡」剛完，「戰太平」剛上的時候，觀衆離塲三分之一，我父親到此才知道觀客踴躍的緣故，很感慨地說：「這時代老牌是不吃香了，想不到一個女孩子，竟有這樣呌座的能力！」自這時候起，呌我一心一意，用功學戲，經朱徐兩位先生指導，梅派的戲，「太眞外傳」，「生死恨」，「洛神」，我全學會了，父親見我有成績，期望很切。那時章小娟由上海來北平演戲，她帶來二牌且角馬燕雲病了，小娟求徐桂芬給她找一位替人，因爲小娟是徐先生得意弟子，當時徐先生便想到我身上，他託朱師傅和我說，呌我和小娟合作，暫帮忙兩禮拜。我想徐先生待我很好，一向給我說戲，都是盡義務的，這點忙不能不帮，並且我和小娟合作，在合上也可以多得點經驗，於我很有益處，當時我和父親一說，我父親很痛快就答應了。</p>
<p>過了幾天，他老人家不知聽了何人的話，對我說：「這戲無論如何不能唱，這是有人暗中破壞我們的顧家班。」我因為已經答應徐朱兩位先生，人家也都已接洽好了，那能反悔，再三聲明和眾小娟合作，根本和顧家班不衝突，看坤角的戲，另有一路人。我父親認爲這話不對，大罵我，　了許多東西，一氣之下，把在吉祥戲園貼出戲也回了。並聲明顧家班從此解散。那時我和小娟合作戲「四郞探母」，戲報已經在廣德樓貼出，這話那能吿訴徐先生，急得我什麼似的，眞是爲難極了，後來我找父親的好友王壽山，給父親再三解說，父親只許我和小娟合作戲頭一天演一塲，以後不許再演。小娟在頭天演戲上午，曾約請我和我哥哥　舟在同和鼾吃飯，爲聯絡惑情，不想我哥哥見徐朱二位先生在座，言語之間對他表示不滿，徐朱二位才知道爲了我和小娟作戲，我家裏已鬧得天翻地覆，我哥哥言外，似怪徐朱二位先生，破壞我們父女感情。徐朱二位先生當時並沒表示，常晚唱過顯塲合作戲之後，第二天朱師傅才對我說：「外面有許多閒話，我們不便再給你說戲，你另拜別的師傅吧。」</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union's Reply to Japan's Peace Conference Note Has Been Delivered to the Soviet Side; Reiterating Its Position and Hoping for an Early Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Our government's reply to the Soviet Union's note of November 27 regarding the convening of a peace treaty with Japan was personally delivered to Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Fedlin on the morning of the 4th when Foreign Minister Wang met with him. According to authoritative sources speaking to reporters, the content of the reply does not change our position. In addition to reiterating our country's suggestions, it also provides explanations, hoping that the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan can gain the support of the Soviet Union and the United States and the United Kingdom on a possible basis, so that it can be convened as soon as possible. The person did not want to speculate on the consequences of this note, but believed that in this matter, the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union have gone to extremes, while our country's opinions are moderate and feasible. If the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union must insist on their original positions "and are unwilling to make concessions to agree to the possible basis provided by our side, they do not know what other ways can be adopted unanimously by the four countries. The Foreign Ministers' Conference currently being held in London still has no possibility of reaching an agreement on important issues of the peace treaty with Germany. These matters are indeed related. In order to completely stop the war in law, all major powers should quickly cooperate on the issues of the East-West peace conferences and comprehensively break the deadlock.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 6th] An external spokesperson told a Central News Agency reporter today that the British government has not yet responded to the Soviet Union's recent note suggesting that the foreign ministers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union hold a meeting in China to discuss the peace treaty with Japan.</p>
<h3>US Emergency Foreign Aid Bill to Undergo Final Vote Next Week</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] The US House of Representatives completed the general debate on the $590 million emergency foreign aid loan bill this afternoon. After the various amendments are proposed on the 8th, it will be discussed again, and then the final vote will be taken on the 9th. More than a dozen members of Congress (mostly Republicans) gave speeches for or against the bill in a half-empty chamber, with sometimes fewer than fifty members present. It was finally passed that various amendments to the bill would be proposed next week.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] Congressional leaders today disregarded the House of Representatives' attempt to cut $590 million in foreign aid funds and firmly insisted on passing the bill before the end of next week and submitting it to the President for signature and implementation. In addition, Deputy Secretary of State Lovett declared yesterday that the current strikes in France and Italy were instigated by the Communist Party, which shows that the Soviet Union's foreign policy has expanded, and the American people must not flinch and fall into the Communist Party's trap.</p>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Regarding the 60 million emergency relief funds that still need to be passed by the US Congress, financial figures here estimate that the total deposits of all commercial banks in Shanghai are about 1.8 trillion yuan. The 60 million yuan will be allocated in three installments. Each installment, if converted at the black market exchange rate for US dollars, will exceed the total deposits in Shanghai, which will have a very large impact on commodity prices. At least the price increase during the Lunar New Year can be invisibly eliminated. In summary, if the emergency relief is entirely used to stabilize prices, it will definitely have a good effect, but if it is used for military purposes, it will be another matter. Regarding the funds required for currency reform, various parties have different estimates, with very large differences in the amounts. According to the views of the aforementioned people, the psychological factor is the most important in this matter. As long as the US government can express its determination and take active action, even if the currency reform fund is only 200 to 300 million US dollars, if people's hearts are stabilized, our country's foreign exchange assets escaping overseas and remittances from overseas Chinese are expected to be recovered in large part, then currency reform will have the possibility of success.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 5th] Life magazine recently published an editorial on the US policy toward China and its relationship to US party politics, supporting the Republican leader's demand for aid to China. It also stated that the US policy toward China should take the same steps as its policy of containing totalitarian aggression in other places. The magazine believes that Marshall's proposal for $300 million in emergency aid to China is vague, slow, and inappropriate. The editorial stated that while the State Department is busy handling the aid to Europe plan, the Chinese Communist Party, using weapons manufactured in Siberia and transported to the Communist areas via Lushun and Dalian, has occupied most of the Northeast and half of North China, and has turned these provinces into "the world's second largest communist area after the Soviet Union." The article then asks: "If Soviet strategists can take care of two or more battle lines at the same time, then why can't the United States do this?" The editorial hopes to immediately restore aid to independent China. The article also said: The United States' procrastination and the Communist Party's great benefits have made the issue of aid to China a matter of life and death for China. Therefore, the most urgent task at present is to determine a policy so that aid can be effective and enable Chairman Chiang to win the war, and not allow the United States to abandon its old allies.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Debates Postal Rate Case; Final Vote Recommends Government Submit to the Yuan for Review; Passes Bill to Increase Legal Interest Rate</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 6th] The Legislative Yuan held its 341st regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 6th. When Sun Ke, the Yuan President, announced the National Government's special permit for the Executive Yuan to adjust postal rates at any time, it caused a fierce debate that lasted a long time. Afterwards, the following proposals were passed: Amendment to Article 29 of the Postal Law; Irrigation Enterprise Encouragement Ordinance; Amendment to the Self-Defense Firearm Management Ordinance; Amendment to the names of the Huaihe River, Yellow River, Yangtze River, North China Pearl River, and other five water conservancy engineering bureaus, and the revision of the accounting and personnel articles in the relevant organizational regulations; Amendment to Article 1 of the Organizational Regulations of the Industrial Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; Passage of the National Bank Staff Appointment and Removal Ordinance; Increase in the legal interest rate. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. (The full text of the Interest Rate Management Ordinance, the amendment to Article 29 of the Salt Administration Ordinance, and the amendment to Articles 3, 5, 6, and 9 of the Self-Defense Firearm Management Ordinance are published in columns 2, 3, and 4 of the second edition.)</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] At the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 6th, the proposal regarding the adjustment of postal and telecommunications rates sparked a debate lasting one hour and forty-five minutes. The final vote passed the motion by Wang Peiren and other members, expressing disagreement with the State Council's special permit for the Executive Yuan to adjust postal and telecommunications rates at any time, and recommending that any increase in postal rates still be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review.</p>
<h3>Committee Members Speak Out</h3>
<p>The proposal was "The National Government's State Council's resolution that, during the period of mobilization and suppression of the rebellion, the Executive Yuan is specially permitted to adjust postal and telecommunications rates at any time, and this Yuan is hereby notified." After Secretary-General Lou Tongsun read the proposal, Committee Member Liu Chiping took the lead in criticizing the government for infringing on the powers of the Legislative Yuan and illegally changing the law by decree. Yuan President Sun Ke immediately explained the process by which the State Council passed the proposal. More than twenty committee members then spoke, raising various opinions on the proposal.</p>
<p>Regarding the adjustment of postal rates, this is the second discussion in the Legislative Yuan regarding the recent proposal to adjust postal rates. The first time was when the Executive Yuan, in order to facilitate automatic adjustment of postal rates, requested amending Article 4 of the Postal Law regarding the postal rates in the attached table, so that future postal rate adjustments would not need to be reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. After the proposal was submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review by the National Government, it was rejected. Committee members insisted that it concerned increasing the people's burden and should still be passed by the Legislative Yuan, and that Article 4 of the Postal Law should not be amended. The Executive Yuan believed that the postal and telecommunications losses were actually due to the increasing fluctuations in commodity prices, and that adjusting postal rates was originally to avoid subsidizing losses and seek symmetry between rights and obligations, avoiding a situation where a few people use postal and telecommunications services and the country subsidizes them, which would not increase the burden on all people. In the past, postal and telecommunications rate adjustments took a considerable amount of time to complete the legislative process, and commodity prices continued to rise, making it difficult to compensate for the losses. Therefore, it was decided to request the National Government to specially permit the Executive Yuan to adjust prices at any time. The State Council passed this at its 16th meeting and ordered the Legislative Yuan to be notified.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Government Seizes Sovereignty Over Kowloon Walled City, Orders Eviction of Residents; We Reiterate Our Position and Have Not Abandoned Kowloon</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 5th] A Hong Kong government spokesman told a Central News Agency reporter on the 5th that the Hong Kong government will continue to abide by the statement issued on September 15 last year, explaining that the United Kingdom has administrative power over Kowloon Walled City. The spokesman said that the Hong Kong government will implement the eviction order issued by the Public Works Department on November 27, which aims to evict about 2,000 Chinese residents of Kowloon Walled City from their current 50 wooden houses. If they do not evacuate, the Hong Kong government "will order them to move." This matter is developing into a major political issue, as the Chinese residents who received the eviction order have organized a joint organization called the Sai On County Kowloon Walled City Residents Association. The association believes that Kowloon is Chinese territory and that China still retains sovereignty over the old Kowloon Walled City. However, the British authorities have different interpretations of their treaty rights and refused to allow the Baoan County authorities to establish a court in Kowloon Walled City last July. Guo Dehua, the special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, is currently in Nanjing, discussing this matter with the government. At the same time, the Hong Kong authorities have not yet taken action to demolish any houses of Chinese residents in Kowloon Walled City. According to the eviction order issued by the Hong Kong government, Chinese residents in Kowloon Walled City must evacuate within six days, which is the stipulated deadline. In addition, the Office of the Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi reiterated the Chinese government's statement on September 17, 1946, stating that China has not abandoned its administrative power over Kowloon. The Special Envoy's Office told the press on the 5th that Guo Dehua, the Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, had met with Hong Kong Governor Grantham twice on November 29 and December 2, reiterating China's position on the administration of Kowloon. Special Envoy Guo stated that the Chinese government does not agree with the eviction order issued by the Public Works Department of the Hong Kong government on November 27.</p>

<h3>In Memoriam: Mr. Yu Songhua</h3>
<p>— Shu Xincheng</p>
<p>When I saw the news of Mr. Yu Songhua's passing in Suzhou in Shanghai newspapers on October 12th, I couldn't help but sigh: another one of my good friends has fallen. I have sighed like this many times in recent years: Mr. Jiang Baili six or seven years ago, Mr. Lu Feibohong, Mr. Tao Xingzhi last year, Mr. He Bocheng, Mr. Chang Yansheng this year: I sighed like this every time they passed away. My sigh not only mourns the departed, but also feels a sense of loneliness as friends of similar age die one by one. At the same time, I also believe that when these friends passed away, they were all under sixty years old. From an anatomical and psychological perspective, their mental strength had not yet reached its peak, and it was precisely when they could have accomplished great things. They should not have died, yet they did. It is clear that their spiritual lives were cut short. The formation of a nation of sick people is already a loss to the country and society, but the mid-way curtailment of such spiritual lives is an even greater, irreparable loss. I believe that Mr. Songhua's death and the deaths of other gentlemen are all indicators of the severe losses suffered by the country and society. If we have no way to reduce the mid-way curtailment of spiritual lives, or even do not realize that their passing is a kind of curtailment, then what is the use of sighing?</p>
<p>Mr. Songhua and I became friends in the ninth year of the Republic of China when he was the chief editor of "Liberation and Reconstruction." At that time, we were both very young. I arrived in Shanghai in the early summer of the ninth year and had our first conversation at the "Shishi Xinbao." We both felt like we had met too late. Later, I taught and lectured in various provinces such as Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei. He, on the other hand, always stayed in his position as a journalist. Even when he went abroad to study and investigate, he focused on journalism. Although we did not see each other often afterwards, we frequently exchanged news through writing, and our friendship deepened day by day. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, I moved to Shanghai to work for Zhonghua, and he worked for Shen Bao, so we had more time to spend together. After the August 13th Incident, he transferred to Singapore, and I often went to Hong Kong. He also came to Hong Kong several times for business, and we often met in Hong Kong. I arranged to have a conversation with him one morning upstairs at the Hong Kong branch of Zhonghua Book Company. That day was Sunday, and we agreed not to invite others to join us so that we could talk freely. Apart from sharing our personal lives and ideals for our careers, we freely discussed everything from the general trends of the world to the domestic situation. We both anticipated that Japan would launch a world war, and we drafted many "cultural national defense" plans on paper. Unexpectedly, the next morning, Hong Kong's airfield was already occupied by the Japanese army, and the Pacific War really broke out. From then on, we did not hear from each other for several years. This spring, I accepted an invitation from the Suzhou National Social Education College to teach a film course in the Department of Electrical Education, and I learned that he had long been the director of the Journalism Department at the college. I went to Suzhou once every two weeks. Before April, he was recuperating in Shanghai, so even though we were colleagues, we still hadn't met. It wasn't until May, when I accompanied Hu Mao-yi, a counselor from the League of Nations' Department of Culture and Education, and Shi Weizhi, the manager of the Encyclopedia Britannica Films Company, to visit Suzhou, that I went to Suzhou several times and had several long talks with him in the faculty dormitory of the college. I had been seriously ill and nearly died between the 31st and 33rd years of the Republic of China, so I paid special attention to the health of people over middle age and also had a special understanding of suffering from illness. Every time we talked, I felt that his body was too weak, and it would not be easy to recover without absolute and long-term rest. I advised him to give up everything and focus on recuperating. However, he was still as responsible as ever for the affairs of the college. During the student strike in May, he was still tirelessly guiding everything. After that, I did not go to Suzhou, and unfortunately, he passed away on October 11th.</p>
<p>Mr. Songhua has passed away. Everyone knows about his contributions to the country and society, and Mr. Cheng's biography also describes it in detail, so I don't need to say more. What I lament is that he was in the prime of his mental capacity. According to the results of anatomy and psychological research, his mental strength can still be said to be immature - a person's mental capacity only fully matures at the age of sixty - but he also died with Mr. Jiang, Lu Fei, Tao, He, Chang, and others. I believe that the country, society, and individuals should all be vigilant. In terms of individuals, modern scientists are working hard to study methods of controlling nature and society, but they uniquely neglect how to control themselves. From a biological point of view, the natural lifespan of human beings should be five times the age of physiological maturity, so the natural death period of a person should be between 100 and 125 years old. Even the average lifespan of Americans reached sixty years and three months last year. In our country, outstanding scholars such as Mr. Jiang, Tao, Bao, Chang, and Songhua, and outstanding entrepreneurs such as Mr. Lu Fei, and even the average lifespan of the country have not yet reached the age. One reason for this may be that one's diet and daily life are not entirely in line with the way to health, and even unintentionally or without time to study issues related to personal longevity. In fact, on the other hand, society is so turbulent, the economy is so chaotic, and the country and society provide so little security for the lives of scholars, that they are busy with life, busy with oil, rice, firewood, and salt, and busy with the education expenses of their children. By the time they are busy and get sick, there are neither free recuperation facilities, nor do they have to worry about the expenses of medical care in addition to the expenses of daily life. Under these circumstances, they are just human beings made of flesh and blood, so how can they withstand such torment?</p>
<p>Mr. Songhua and many of my friends died when their mental strength had not yet matured. We not only mourn our friends, but also lament for the country and society. We mourn Mr. Songhua, and at the same time, we hope that the individuals who have not died and the national authorities and social undertakings will be deeply vigilant: be vigilant that talent is not easy to come by, and how to plan in advance to reduce the causes that cause people to die early, so that they will no longer follow in the footsteps of Mr. Songhua and others. That would not only be the good fortune of the undying talent, but also the inescapable responsibility of those who control the country and society.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Debate</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one)</p>
<p>Three Different Opinions Today, when the committee members spoke, they fell into three categories of opinions: The first opinion was to advocate that the Legislative Yuan supplement the procedures, formulate a resolution, and stipulate that during the period of suppressing the rebellion, the Executive Yuan may adjust postal and telecommunications rates at any time. Those who held this view included Chen Guyuan, Chen Hong, Chen Haicheng, Zhong Tianxin, Huang Youchang, etc. The reason was that the current Legislative Yuan is not the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the constitution, and is a family with the Kuomintang government. The resolutions of the State Council lack a legal basis, but in fact, postal rates must be increased. It seems difficult for the Legislative Yuan's opposition to change the resolutions of the State Council, so a resolution should be formulated to give the resolutions of the State Council a legal basis. Chen Yang, Chen Haicheng, etc.</p>
<p>advocated stipulating in the resolution that prices should not be increased arbitrarily and that the people's burden should be taken into account. The second opinion, such as those who held opposing views, included Liu Chiping, Zuo Gong, Wang Yuxiang, Di Ying, Jiu, Zhang Banghan, Xia Erkang, Wang Taren, Li Qing, Tan Tiwu, Liu Keshu, etc. They believed that the resolutions of the State Council changed the law by order, and since Article 4 of the original Postal Law was not suspended, this resolution was appropriate. The increase in postal rates was universally accepted by the Chinese people. The Legislative Yuan kept silent and did not speak. At the time, the committee members were all ancient. And the legislators increased the people's right to. On that day, the democratic came out, and the people attached importance to the opinions of the Legislative Yuan in the Legislative Yuan. The committee members believed that the government Legislative Yuan replaced the committee members. It is necessary to do it. The third opinion was that there was no need to have any opinions, and they did not express any opinions at all. Those who held this view included Chen Gu Xuan, Deng Gongli, etc.</p>
<h3>Formulation and Voting on the Bill</h3>
<p>After a long discussion, Dean Sun announced the end of the discussion and formulated a resolution based on the legal basis of the supplementary State Council resolution proposed by Chen Guyuan, Chen Hong, etc., and a suggestion to the National Government proposed by Wang Peiren and Liu Keshu. During the period of preparation for the implementation of the constitution, it is not appropriate to change the law by order. If postal rates must be increased, the competent department should be asked to draft the increased amount and send it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The matter was put to a vote. As a result, Wang Peiren and Liu Keshu's proposal was passed by a majority of 43 votes to 14.</p>

<h3>Luo Zhuoying and Liang Huasheng's Talk</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) According to Luo's talk: In the area where the National Army expanded in the Jilin-Changchun-Siping area, the people did not talk about safety, but only asked for help in solving the difficulties in materials caused by the interruption of transportation. Jilin is short of banknotes, and banknotes have been transported by plane for use. At the same time, it is also striving for food and firewood abroad. There are currently three bases for the Communist bandits in the Northeast, the main force is in the triangle area of ​​Jilin-Changchun-Siping, connecting with Songbei; another is the Jinxi Corridor, and the other is the southern Liaoning area. The National Army's southern advance to capture Dashiqiao and other places was a preemptive action, because the Communist bandits wanted to launch an offensive from southern Liaoning. Also, the National Army in the Gaiping area is in the suburbs, not in the city, also Gaiping. As for the next move of the bandits, it is feared that it will be in a month.</p>
<p>According to Liang Huasheng, of the two cities and 20 counties in Jilin Province, except for the two cities of Jilin and Changchun and Yongji County, most of the rest have fallen into the hands of the bandits. Today, Jiutai has not been recovered, and the Jilin-Changchun Road and the Changchun-Siping Road have not been opened. The bandits are gathering in Yitong, Shuangyang, Panshi, Huadian, Nong'an, and Huaide south of Jilin and Changchun. Military ambitions have not yet developed, and economic damage is becoming more and more severe. The military and civilians of Jilin have shown outstanding performance after being besieged by 70,000 people for 26 days. Today, due to the lack of food and fuel, they are enduring the severe cold of minus 28 degrees, storing grain and building cities, and the military and political authorities are training soldiers and educating the people to join the production and obtain the ability to defend and attack.</p>

<h3>After Inspecting Northeastern Industry and Mining, Sun Zhaoqi Freely Discusses His Impressions</h3>
<p>"Shenyang, This Newspaper, 6th" Today, Sun Zhaoqi freely discussed his impressions of inspecting the industry and mining of the Northeast with this newspaper's reporter, saying: Each mine forms an external outpost of Shenyang and is producing on the front lines, which is naturally difficult. All Chinese people value Northeastern industry, but not all can understand the actual difficulties. They are not worried about the fluid situation. The military authorities attach great importance to the industrial and mining areas. The industry and mining can only show vigorous vitality after the situation stabilizes and develops. Among the five or six offensives of the communists, the losses to the industrial and mining areas were the greatest. Our observations show that at most, they have recovered to the state of October. It is still very difficult to restore the old appearance before May. The difficulty of the work currently undertaken is beyond what outsiders can know. I am deeply respectful of their spirit. In addition, I believe that close cooperation in all aspects is particularly important. Mr. Sun is scheduled to take a train to Beiping the day after tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Sharp Population Decline, Increased Unemployment: Dalian, a City of Poverty and Loneliness</h3>
<p>U.S. Consul General in Dalian, Mr. Henninghoff, Speaks the Truth</p>
<p>"U.S. News Agency, Washington, 5th" The State Department announced today that U.S. Consul General in Dalian, Mr. Henninghoff, will not return to his post but will be assigned to a new position. Mr. Henninghoff returned to Washington five weeks ago. The affairs of the U.S. in the "free port" of Northeast China under Soviet occupation are temporarily being handled by Deputy Consul General Mr. Bartch.</p>
<p>In an interview with reporters today, Mr. Henninghoff explained that Dalian, once an important transportation center, is now completely paralyzed. Hunger, disease, and suffering are found everywhere among the greatly reduced population. Mr. Henninghoff himself has encountered extreme difficulties in all his daily work.</p>
<p>Technically, under the Sino-Soviet Agreement of August 14, 1945, Dalian is nominally a free port open to international commerce for all countries. However, Mr. Henninghoff said: "Even so, there is no other major seaport in these three northeastern provinces where the Iron Curtain is so thick and terrifying." American travelers are not allowed to enter, American commerce does not exist, and American property in the area once reached 200 million U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>In August, the State Department formally reiterated its earlier request in January that the Soviet Union open the port for trade. The August note stated: "Although two years have passed since the Japanese surrender, Dalian has not yet been opened to world trade, and representatives of American firms have not been allowed to occupy or even visit their properties on the outskirts of the city, which they have long owned." Mr. Henninghoff also said: "The population of Dalian is now only half of the 1.3 million in 1945. Due to the cutting off of railways and the blockade of the port, the only transportation is Chinese fishing boats and Soviet ships transporting military supplies to and from Soviet ports."</p>
<p>Poor Sanitary Conditions, Typhoid Fever and Smallpox are Rampant</p>
<p>"Unemployment is everywhere, poverty is increasing, and once bustling streets are now deserted. Many shops have closed.</p>
<p>The Soviet occupation forces control everything. There are 30,000 to 50,000 guard vehicles nearby. Travel within a ten-mile radius of the city is prohibited unless permission is obtained, and obtaining permission is difficult.</p>
<p>Medicine is scarce, and the water supply is insufficient. Sanitary conditions are very poor. During his stay in Dalian, cholera, typhoid fever, smallpox, and other diseases were rampant.</p>
<p>Prices are extremely high, so consulate staff rely on canned food for their livelihood. His most difficult problem is having to carry out his daily work in a "vacuum," almost completely isolated from the rest of the world. The Soviet Union has refused to allow Chinese radio operators to enter the country for months, and the Consul General's communications can only be maintained through Soviet communication agencies.</p>
<p>Mr. Henninghoff's New Post May Be to Work in Japan</p>
<p>"China Financial News Agency, Washington, 5th" The U.S. State Department announced today that Mr. Henninghoff, the U.S. Consul General in Dalian, who recently returned to the U.S. to consult with the Bureau, may be transferred to another position. A successor has not yet been announced. It is speculated that he may be reassigned to work in Japan because he is proficient in Japanese.</p>

<h3>Lovett Publicly Accuses the Soviets of Inciting Labor Strikes in France and Italy; Dulles Continues to Meet with French Authorities</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett said on the 5th that the Soviet Union is promoting strikes and unrest in France and Italy to "intimidate" the United States into abandoning its aid to Europe plan. He told the Senate Appropriations Committee that while the labor strikes appear to be initiated by local Communist parties in France and Italy, they are in fact "an extension of Soviet foreign policy." Since the U.S. Congress approved an emergency relief plan for France, Italy, and Austria in mid-November, Lovett has for the first time formally attributed the domestic labor strikes and unrest in France and Italy to the Soviet Union. Referring to the labor strikes, he said: "You cannot ignore them, because the labor strikes are occurring while Congress is in session, subcommittees are starting to work, and the Four Foreign Ministers are meeting in London." He asked the committee to allocate funds to implement the U.S. emergency winter relief plan. "In some aspects, we must decide our position. If we want to study this matter, we cannot be intimidated by these strikes."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] Dulles is scheduled to return to London on the 7th.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 5th] Marshall's special advisor Mr. Dulles, held a special meeting with reporters in Paris on the 5th, expressing his admiration for the French people's efforts to maintain the integrity of their country. Regarding the criticism from the communists, he said that he did not consider the French Communist Party a French political party. He first stated: "I am one of the representatives of the U.S. delegation attending the Foreign Ministers' Conference, so this visit to Paris naturally requires the consent of Secretary of State Marshall. However, this does not mean that I have any official mission. My plan in Paris is entirely private in nature, and I hope to return to London as soon as possible on Sunday." Mr. Dulles continued: "I have already met with President Auriol, Prime Minister Schuman, and Finance Minister Mayer. I also plan to visit Justice Minister Marie and Socialist Party veteran Blum. The events in France will have a more decisive impact on the future of Europe than the current stage of debate at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. In the eyes of Americans, the events in France are more important than those in Italy. If human freedom suffers setbacks in France, Americans will be extremely concerned. I believe that the current events indicate a greater urgency for aid to Europe, and I expect the U.S. Republican Party to be more willing to support the aid to France bill as a result." When asked if he planned to visit General de Gaulle, he replied: "My trip is only to obtain information, not to negotiate anything with anyone, so I do not rule out the possibility of meeting with representatives of any French political party."</p>

<h3>Truman Calls for the Wise Use of National Resources</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Everglades City, Florida, 6th] During his vacation in the South, President Truman presided over the dedication ceremony of the National Park here today and delivered a speech stating that the United States must closely protect its natural resources so that the United States can continue to be the home of freedom. He said that the various factors that build a great country are not fully known to people. Mutual assistance among citizens is one, the country's provision of a good life for the people is another, and citizens' recognition of the country's responsibility to the world is yet another. The wise use of natural resources is the foundation for the success of the country's various efforts. The peace question requires courage and effort as much as the war question. We want to keep our country prosperous, but if we cannot understand the lessons of other countries wasting national resources, there will inevitably be regrettable consequences.</p>
<h3>Marshall Proposes Unifying Germany's Politics and Economy: Advocates Removing Boundary Lines and Exchanging Materials</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 6th] It is reported that Marshall and Bevin will make another effort on the 6th to urge Molotov to abandon his stance and begin discussing the German issue. Marshall will force Molotov to answer whether the Soviet Union still regards Germany's 10 billion reparations as a condition for unifying Germany's economy. If the Soviet Union continues to insist, the hope of reaching an agreement quickly is slim. On the other hand, Molotov may also ask Britain and the United States whether they still plan to establish a separate government in West Germany or whether they can publicly announce that they will abandon this plan. It is increasingly believed that this is an important key to the current deadlock. If it cannot be broken, the current Foreign Ministers' Conference will follow in the footsteps of the previous Moscow Conference. It is rumored here that Marshall is already packing his bags and preparing to return home within a week. Marshall's staff denied this, saying that the four foreign ministers have just touched on the core of the German issue.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 5th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall on the 5th demanded that the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference end the current division of Germany and proposed five U.S. policies towards Germany: 1. Basic personal freedom. 2. The boundary lines of the occupation zones are removed, except for being regarded merely as boundary markers of the four occupation zones, so that the opinions and goods of the people throughout Germany can be freely exchanged. 3. There is a clear decision on the economic burden that the German people should bear. 4. The relationship between the Allied Control Council and the future German government must be determined. 5. Safeguarding European security to prevent future German aggression. Marshall said that the failure of the Four Powers to take action on Germany "has delayed Germany's and Europe's recovery and caused hundreds of millions of people to suffer tragic consequences." Marshall made this important statement of policy after dining with Molotov at the Soviet embassy. So far in the Four Power Conference, this is probably his first and most powerful appeal for practical action. At the same time, this was also the first private meeting between the two. At the subsequent Foreign Ministers' Conference, Molotov gave a stern rebuttal to Marshall's attack, saying that Marshall's reference to German unification "was merely a formal request for unification." Marshall's statement was "too narrow and therefore unjust." He accused Britain and the United States of trying to undermine the Four Power Agreement and announced that the Soviet Union would insist on its demand for $10 billion in reparations from Germany. Marshall asked the Four Powers to abandon general principles and immediately solve practical problems and explain what the true opinions on the peace treaty with Germany are. He severely criticized Molotov's statement on the establishment of an all-German government, saying that it was obvious that the Soviet Union wanted people who supported the Communist Party in Germany to occupy an important position in it.</p>

(This crisis refers to the buying spree that occurred in various cities in the Soviet Union.) It is reported that Soviet buyers are buying up many goods, but their attention is focused on durable and storable goods (such as winter clothing and dry goods). Several stores in Moscow are temporarily closed under the name of "interior renovation", and even more stores are closed under the name of "inventory". All stores that continue to operate are doing booming business until the goods are sold out. U.S. reporters in Moscow have not been able to report on this buying spree by the Soviet people.</p>

<h3>The U.S. Explores China's Opinion on Sending International Troops to the Holy Land</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 6th] The New York Times reported from Lake Success today that the United States has explored with China the possibility of sending Chinese troops to the Holy Land as part of an international force in the event that the situation in Palestine becomes more serious and severe military fighting occurs. The U.S. suggested that the Chinese troops sent to the Holy Land be between two and three thousand, but so far, there has been no response from Nanjing. A U.S. government spokesman declined to comment on the previous statement, while others said that if a large-scale conflict occurs in the Holy Land, the United States will explore the attitudes of other countries.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] New York, 6th broadcast: Lake Success dispatch, after the Holy Land partition plan is passed, the international peacekeeping force may need to be used, but members of the Chinese delegation here have not heard anything about the rumor that the United States has consulted China on whether it can send troops to participate in the international peacekeeping force.</p>
<h3>Japan's Second New National Diet Scheduled to Convene on the 10th of This Month; Chaos Erupts Again in the National Diet Yesterday</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Japan's second National Diet is scheduled to convene on the 10th of this month. Although the periods of the first and second National Diets are connected, according to general regulations, the National Diet must adjourn for several weeks after it opens and formally discuss bills starting next spring. Yesterday, the Cabinet meeting believed that this adjournment was not of great significance and decided to request the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors to cancel this adjournment. After the opening ceremony on the 10th, it will continue to discuss various bills. [Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] Today's plenary session of the Diet was not convened until 6:20 PM. The reason is that the Liberal Party proposed this morning that the Speaker failed to maintain order in the Diet and should hold a vote of no confidence against him. At that time, the bill on the national control of mineral mines had been submitted, and several members of the Diet were fighting each other and roaring on the podium. The government party proposed to restrain the Liberal Party members who were "behaving despicably". After negotiations throughout the afternoon, the Liberal Party agreed to withdraw its motion to hold a vote of no confidence, and the government also agreed to narrow the scope of its proposal. Of the eleven Liberal Party members who were originally to be punished, only three were punished.</p>
<h3>U.S. Banned Arms Shipments to the Middle East; The Situation in Palestine is Gradually Stabilizing; British Urgently Deploy Troops to Suppress Arab-Jewish Conflicts in Asia</h3>
<p>[United States News Agency, Washington, 5th] The State Department announced today that the transportation of arms and ammunition to troubled areas in the Middle East has been prohibited. The State Department said that this policy also applies to similar items currently outside the United States, including lease-lend armaments and ammunition, and the sale of surplus U.S. military equipment and ammunition.</p>
<p>[United States News Agency, Washington, 5th] According to an announcement issued today, the U.S. State Department has advised its envoys currently stationed in the Middle East to be cautious to prevent any danger of damage to the lives and property of U.S. citizens.

<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 6th] In the Mansieh district at the junction of Tel Aviv and Jaffa, more than 30 houses caught fire after a violent explosion yesterday, and are still burning at night. Intermittent gunfire between the two cities stopped on the morning of the 6th. Official statistics show that 33 Jews and 22 Arabs have died in the unrest in the past four days. Starting today, the entire territory of Palestine seems to have gradually stabilized, probably because the Grand Mufti Husseini ordered the Arab Higher Committee to cancel the large-scale demonstration scheduled for yesterday.</p>

<h3>Important Resolutions Regarding Legislative Yuan Elections: Voters to Collect Ballots with ID Cards; Eliminating Fraudulent Voting and Preventing Duplication; Sent to the Central Election Headquarters for Final Review</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Election Office held its eighth election committee meeting yesterday at 11:00 AM, to discuss technical issues for the upcoming Legislative Yuan elections. Chairman Wu Guozhen, Zhang Xiaosong, Chen Baotai, Wang Lanseng, Li Junfu, and other committee members were present, adjourning at 5:00 PM. The important resolutions made at the meeting were as follows: During the Legislative Yuan elections, national ID cards will be used in place of voter registration certificates for ballot collection. The number of polling stations will be reduced from 263 to 156, with 30 for occupational elections and 126 for regional elections. For the Legislative Yuan elections, the first day will be for occupational voting, and the second and third days will be for regional voting. The above three points have been submitted to the Nanjing Central Election Headquarters for final review. According to Section Chief Chen Minshu, to ensure that every voter has an ID card, an announcement will be made in advance once the Central Election Headquarters approves the recommendations, allowing residents currently without ID cards to apply for them in time. This measure can prevent duplicate voting and eliminate fraudulent practices, as citizens with lower levels of education generally have no interest in voter registration certificates but are less willing to lend out ID cards, which are necessary for obtaining rice, coal, and sugar. Furthermore, ID cards have a photograph of the holder, making forgery difficult.</p>

The result was heavy casualties, and the remaining bandits were completely annihilated at the mouth of the Huangpu River. The exercise lasted about an hour, with realistic performances and satisfactory results.</p>
<p>The North Station Police Precinct also held a large-scale suppression exercise last night, with excellent results.</p>
<h3>Three Japanese Class A War Criminals to be Indicted by Military Tribunal for Heinous Crimes of Arson, Murder, Rape</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Three Japanese Class A war criminals, including Lieutenant General Sakuraba Shiro, have been investigated by the city's Military Tribunal and were indicted yesterday. The main points of the indictment are as follows:</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Sakuraba Shiro, 56 years old, from Aomori Prefecture, Japan, a graduate of the Army Military Academy, came to China in 1940 and held various important positions in the army. In 1945, he was promoted to commander of the 82nd Independent Mixed Brigade of the 20th Army, stationed in the Zhuzhou area of Hunan Province. He condoned his subordinates' acts of rape, murder, and plunder against our merchants and civilians. In Zhuzhou alone, over 300 compatriots were killed, over 100 women were raped, and countless others were abducted from other places, secretly killed, and their bodies disposed of to eliminate traces. In addition, he burned down over 200 houses in the area, causing incalculable losses to the people's property.</p>
<p>Major General Kurose Heiichi, 54 years old, from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, came to China in 1942, serving as the commander of the 133rd Regiment of the 20th Army, fighting in Zhejiang and Jiangxi. In 1943, he was promoted to commander of the 57th Infantry Brigade of the 68th Division of the 20th Army, participating in the Battle of Hengyang. He subsequently advanced to Qiyang, burning villages near the Liuhai Chong area of the county to the ground. He also ordered his troops to use machine guns to strafe unarmed civilians, resulting in dozens of deaths and property losses of over 100 million yuan. Afterwards, he abducted dozens of men and women, subjecting them to wanton rape and beatings, displaying extreme inhumanity.</p>
<p>Major General Kuriwa Shoji, 56 years old, from Nagano Prefecture, Japan, served as the commander of the Transport Regiment of the 3rd Division. In August 1937, he led his troops to land in Wusong, China, participating in the war. When his troops were stationed in the Taicang County area, due to a shortage of horses in the army, he forcibly requisitioned over 200 farming cattle from the local population without compensation, and immediately had these cattle moved with the army resulting in huge losses for our civilian population.</p>

<h3>Approximately Eight Thousand European Refugees in China Awaiting Repatriation; Stansby Arrives in Shanghai to Investigate</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Mr. Stansby, a special representative of the Preparatory Committee of the International Refugee Organization, arrived in Shanghai from Geneva on the 25th of last month. When a reporter visited him yesterday, he said that the mission of this trip was to investigate the repatriation of refugees in the Far East, and discuss various related issues with Mr. Wang Renlin, the director of the Far East Branch, such as the difficulties in repatriation and ways to accelerate the repatriation process, so as to report to the General Assembly, and at the same time convey the opinions of the General Assembly. Mr. Stansby said: In addition to those who have been repatriated, there are still 8,000 European refugees in China waiting to be sent back, most of whom are currently concentrated in Hongkou and other places in Shanghai. As for overseas Chinese stranded in European countries, about 25,000 have been sent back to their original pre-war locations, and more than 25,000 are still awaiting repatriation. Most of them were residing in Burma, the Philippines, Singapore, and other places before the war, and very few returned to their hometowns in China.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Cables Government, Urging Cautious Handling of Economic Measures; Rational Revision of the Ban on Remittances, Inadvisability of Blocking Loan Access</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that the government's current economic stabilization measures lack careful consideration, and may lead to throwing the baby out with the bathwater. They specifically cabled the government, urging cautious handling to avoid hindering normal economic development due to isolated incidents. The main points are: Shanghai is still a relatively developed center for light industry and the distribution of daily necessities. Remittances to Shanghai for purchasing goods are a necessary phenomenon of mutual dependence between the urban economy and rural life. If the authorities do not address the root cause and apply blanket restrictions, although legitimate banks may stop accepting remittances, private institutions can still conduct transactions in secret. Furthermore, goods transactions can be transformed into fund transactions, which would not truly implement the policy. It only reduces the legitimate business of banks and drives fish into the deep, causing more capital to flow to the black market. It is bound to make finance more turbulent and uneasy. Moreover, if domestic funds are not allowed to be remitted out for legitimate use, how can it be guaranteed that they will not be used to hoard grain and monopolize raw materials locally? This will lead to speculative rises in agricultural products and imbalances in supply and demand, stimulating urban prices and escalating the situation. Focusing solely on price controls in one area will have adverse effects that reverberate throughout the whole economy. This was a lesson learned in the wartime rear and should not be repeated. It is proposed that the current ban on remittances be rationally revised. At present, it is the time for harvesting agricultural products, and industries and businesses urgently need loans to purchase materials. In recent years, the capital of commercial banks has been weak, relying entirely on the injection of funds from national banks. However, the Four Joint Offices have recently stopped national banks from lending, leading to even greater caution among banks. Not only will new loans not be made, but existing loans will also be recalled on schedule. The channels for industrial and commercial financing will inevitably become narrower, forcing them to turn to the black market for high-interest loans. This will inevitably hinder production and promote price increases. Therefore, it is not advisable to block access to legitimate industrial and commercial loans completely, so as to avoid escalating the situation and causing the economic emergency measures to have the opposite effect.</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Not Considering Revision of House Tax Rate</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The city's house tax collection method is based on 5% of the value assessed in 1937, multiplied by 180. The central government believes that this method is extremely unreasonable, as rents have risen significantly. The house tax rate should be based on current rents. The Ministry of Finance has instructed the city government to revise the house tax collection method. However, according to Finance Bureau Chief Tian Yongqian, the Ministry of Finance's method is difficult to implement, as homeowners may not report their actual rents to the authorities. Therefore, the Finance Bureau has not yet considered the above method.</p>
<h3>Cheng Tianru, Involved in the Xu Jizhuang Case, Submits a Statement of Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] In the case of Xu Jizhuang, former director of the Postal Remittances Administration, and others being accused of corruption, Cheng Tianru, the managing director of Zhenye Bank, was implicated. The police believe he is suspected of concealing fugitives. The case is currently under investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office. Yesterday, Cheng submitted a statement to the District Prosecutor's Office in defense. The statement stated that the incident occurred around 7:00 PM on the 14th of last month. He went to 22 Tai'an Road at the invitation of lawyer Zhang Yaoguang to discuss the issue of lawyer fees for Xu Jizhuang's defense. Suddenly, plainclothes officers entered the house, claiming to be checking household registrations. Because he did not know the identity of the officers, he was inevitably alarmed. He arrived in car number "13690," which was parked outside. Fearing that the car would be robbed, he signaled for the car to leave. Later, the plainclothes officers identified him as Xu Jizhuang. After checking the photo, they realized their mistake. Only then did he realize that the officers were from the police station. In fact, there was only one door at 22 Tai'an Road. If Xu Jizhuang were inside, there would be no way to escape. Therefore, Xu Jizhuang's failure to be apprehended had nothing to do with him. He feels wronged to be listed as a defendant.</p>
<h3>Railway Police at Zhenjiang Station Crack Down on Smuggling of Military Weapons; Three Cases Discovered, One Suspect Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Railway Bureau Police Department recently issued a detailed report on the crackdown on the major smuggling of military weapons at Zhenjiang Station. It stated that at around 10:00 AM on the 29th of last month, a porter, No. 87, received a green travel bag from a passenger on the fifth京沪line train. After leaving the station, the owner of the bag was not seen following, so he reported it to the military police stationed at the station. Upon opening the bag for inspection, they found a Czech-style light machine gun, serial number 118-7, as well as two spare barrels and six magazines. The military police confiscated the items. After this incident, the Police Department immediately sent officers to investigate. At around 12:00 AM that night, when the ninth train arrived, a soldier was carrying a heavy travel bag, looking flustered, intending to escape towards the engine room exit. The railway police spotted him, ordered him to stop, and searched him. They found a Czech-style light machine gun, four magazines, and six types of parts for a Japanese Type 96 light machine gun. The soldier was arrested and interrogated. He confessed that his name was Wang Zhenchao, and he was instigated by Li Xueming. He also stated that Li might continue to transport military weapons to Zhenjiang on the 30th. More police officers were dispatched to inspect the small inns near the station. At around 7:00 PM on the 30th, it was reported that a tea server at the Dachang Hotel had received a wicker trunk from a soldier of unknown surname. The military police, upon hearing the news, immediately went to open it. Shockingly, it contained more machine gun parts, which could be assembled with the ones previously confiscated into a complete machine gun. Furthermore, Wang Zhenchao confessed that he had lived at Cui Qingyao's place, the security company commander for the 74th Division's Heavy Equipment Battalion, at 74 Yidu Wharf, Daxi Road, Zhenjiang, for a long time. The Police Department immediately sent undercover agents to investigate. Cui claimed that he did know Wang Zhenchao, but he had no knowledge of his actions outside. The Railway Police Department attaches great importance to this case, believing that it may be a planned conspiracy to disrupt the security of the two railway lines.</p>

Mrs. Muir and others delivered short speeches, expressing their willingness to help China prevent the spread of leprosy and provide relief to leprosy patients. They came to China this time to investigate the situation of leprosy in China, and will convene a world-class leprosy relief conference in Cuba in April next year. According to Bureau Chief Zhang, there are about 5 million leprosy patients in the world, and China accounts for one-fifth, with more than one million patients. Leprosy is no longer an incurable disease in modern medicine, and he hopes that all parties will provide assistance to help the unfortunate patients suffering from this disease. Our Chinese Leprosy Relief Association has been established for 21 years, and has held five general meetings in the past. Its work achievements include inserting leprosy teaching materials into textbooks published by the Commercial Press to arouse attention from all walks of life, and establishing five leprosy hospitals in Nanhai, Guangdong, Qionghai, Jiangxi Nanchang, Xinhua, Hunan, and Shanghai.

<h3>Social Bureau Rules on Compensation for Taoist Temple Employees</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The employees of the five Taoist temples in the city, including Baiyun Guan, Tongbai Gong, Qingchu Guan, and Sanmao Gong, previously requested that the temples handle the disposal of tin foil ash in the same way as Buddhist associations, but this was not accepted by the Taoist Association. The various Taoist temples believed that the tin foil ash should belong entirely to the temples. After mediation by the Social Bureau failed, it decided on a ruling to resolve the matter as follows: (1) Open accounting system for small accounts; all staff can share equally, abolishing the manager's 20% share. (2) The basic monthly wage is calculated at one yuan, one yuan and fifty cents, and two yuan. (3) 50% of the proceeds from the tin foil ash will be used for labor welfare funds, and the remaining 50% will go to the temples.</p>
<h3>Rural General Council Employees Reach Agreement on Retirement Benefits</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The American Rural General Council was forced to close down when the Pacific War broke out. At that time, Chairman Fan Keling announced its dissolution and stipulated that the 30+ employees including Song Zuyi would be paid six months' salary rice subsidies and all these years' savings. However, due to the sudden changes in the economic situation and the freezing of bank funds, the association could not allocate the funds and changed them to vouchers, stating that they would be exchanged for cash when business resumed. After the victory, the association resumed business, but the savings and rice subsidies of the former employees had not yet been issued. After the unemployed workers requested mediation from the Social Bureau, a settlement record was signed yesterday: (1) The 35 unemployed workers including Song Zuyi will be dismissed with severance pay from the employer. (2) The severance pay shall be issued by the employer based on the accumulated system used by the General Council in the past to obtain the retirement fund base, multiplied by the November worker's cost of living index of 53100 times. If the base is less than 50 yuan, it will be calculated as 50 yuan. (3) After receiving the severance pay, the labor side shall not make any further requests to the employer.</p>

<h3>Yue Opera Actress Loses Child Custody Case; Reaches Settlement in Court, Child Still Returned to Father</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yue Opera actress Shen Meiying and her former lover Zhang Yongsheng were fighting over their child. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Huixiu of the Civil Division of the Liu Bu District Court advised them to reach a settlement. They signed a settlement record in court, and the child will still be returned to the father for raising. This child custody case has thus come to an end. Shen Meiying and Zhang Yongsheng had an affair and lived together in 1943. Later, due to disagreements, they signed an agreement to end their cohabitation on February 19, 1944. At the time of cohabitation, Shen was already pregnant. It was agreed that if a boy was born, the father would take him. Later, Shen gave birth to a boy, who was taken back by the Zhang family and named Tianren. He is now three years old and is being raised by Zhang's wife, Wang Qiufang. On the 6th of last month, Shen Meiying asked someone to borrow 5 million yuan from Zhang, which Zhang refused. Shen became angry and brought people to Zhang's house to cause trouble, injuring Zhang's wife and taking the child away. The District Procuratorate prosecuted this case, and the Criminal Division of the District Court sentenced Shen to 60 days of detention, suspended for two years, and ordered her to pay 340,000 yuan in medical expenses. However, the child had not been returned, so Zhang applied to the Civil Division of the District Court to order the return of Tianyou and declare provisional execution. During yesterday's court session, both parties expressed their willingness to reach a settlement, and a settlement record was established in court.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Self-Defense Organizations, Support Required for Participation</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan believes that as constitutional government is approaching, banditry is still rampant, and in order to promote the spirit of democracy, mobilize the people's strength, and eliminate obstacles to constitutional government, he sent a telegram to the Municipal Council to cooperate sincerely with the government. The telegram stated: Local governments, in order to strengthen the suppression of the rebellion, enrich self-defense organizations, mobilize manpower and material resources, and even temporarily hold special self-defense taxes and levies, are all required by the situation and cannot be avoided. Since it is for the benefit of the people, the people will naturally be happy to contribute. However, since it concerns the people's burden, it must first be submitted to the council for approval in accordance with the law before it can be implemented. It is hoped that councils at all levels will fairly review the emergency measures adapted to mobilization by governments at the same level. If it is indeed necessary to suppress the rebellion, they must do their utmost to provide support and focus attention on the supervision and inspection of implementation.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi's Red Earth Is Desolate, No Porcelain in Porcelain Street, from Goyang to Nanchang</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 4th] In the eastern part of Jiangxi Province, the railway has not been repaired far beyond Goyang, and it is necessary to travel by car on the highway. After crossing the Xin River, it is simply a desolate scene. On the famous red earth of Jiangxi, red grass as tall as a foot grows, and there is no sign of human habitation for dozens of miles. Arriving at Zuofeng, we saw grotesque rocks, and in the distance, there were some red-leaved trees and green trees. Near Guixi, we could see more than a hundred households. The Guixi Bridge is under construction. From this road to Yingtan, there is a distance of almost fifty kilometers, but the scattered fields in the wilderness, especially the half-demolished houses left over from the bombings, are built of red stone, giving an indescribable feeling.</p>
<p>Intersection and Distribution Center for Local Products</p>
<p>Yingtan is the intersection of the Xin River and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and it is an important transportation hub. It is a distribution center for rice and porcelain in Jiangxi, and it is a very important place. We sincerely hope that it can gradually recover.</p>
<p>After the car passed Tengtan, the desolate situation seemed to be better. There was a lot of land, and it was already being cultivated. There were also farmers working in the fields with three or four cows. Looking at Dongxiang, only about 30% of the land was barren. Villages were everywhere, and red leaves grew all over the mountains and fields. Arriving at Xiabu Settlement, most of the fields have been harvested, and there is a considerable amount of cultivated land. The corners are full of red leaves, mixed with deep green branches, which makes them appear more vigorous and powerful. Beyond Jinxian, the land became barren again, but the highway is a straight line, and it is still a straight line to Linchuan, about fifteen kilometers long.</p>
<p>Liangjiadu Bridge Under Reconstruction</p>
<p>Liangjiadu Ferry, this is the main stream of the Fu River, and the river surface is very wide. In the past, the railway built the Liangjiadu Bridge here. It was bombed once during the retreat, and then bombed again when it was seen that the enemy was not coming, and then bombed again. The enemy also bombed it once when they came, so the destruction of this bridge can be said to be the most thorough. Now, after the efforts of Huang Shouyi, the director of the Second Bridge Engineering Office of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, a steel plate girder bridge with 14 spans, each 35 meters long, is being built again. Each span of this length is the first time in China. The bridge was originally intended to use steel plate girders, but the steel plate needs to be shipped from Canada next year. Therefore, Director Huang designed to salvage the destroyed steel plate girders and select the good ones for lengthening. Director Huang led us to see the workshop, and they were all working hard.</p>
<p>Nanchang City Looks at Municipal Culture</p>
<p>When we arrived in Nanchang, night had already fallen. The uneven roads in the urban area, the dim street lights, have been destroyed and still need time and effort to rebuild.</p>
<p>Nanchang City has a population of 264,500. Jiangxi Province has a population of more than 13.7 million. The area of Jiangxi is larger than that of Fujian and Zhejiang and Jiangsu, but the population is not as large as that of the three provinces of Jiang, Zhejiang, and Fujian, so it is no wonder that it is so desolate.</p>
<p>Nanchang has the National Zhongzheng University, which is located on Wangcheng Slope, about 11 kilometers from the city. It has five colleges: liberal arts, science, law, engineering, and agriculture. There are more than 1,300 students, but only 20,000 books in the library and not many instruments. There are also a sports school, a music school, and a library with 50,000 thread-bound books and 10,000 ordinary reading books.</p>
<p>We went to visit Jieshi Park and Baihuazhou. Baihuazhou is in the center of Dong Lake. The locals said that the lake is always smelly. When asked why they don't dredge it, they said there is no money.</p>
<p>Youmin Temple, Shadows of the Previous Dynasty</p>
<p>There is a historical temple in the area called Youmin Temple. Inside is a bronze Buddha. The old monk said that it weighs 108,000 kilograms and is 1.6 zhang tall. It is said that it was cast during the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang in the Five Dynasties. At that time, the temple was called Dafosi, then changed to Yongning Temple in the Tang Dynasty, Youming Temple in the Ming Dynasty, Youqing Temple in the Qing Dynasty, and Youmin Temple in the Republican era. This is a very interesting story. During the Ming Dynasty, Prince Ning Chenghao conspired to rebel here. His wife, Consort Lou, tried to stop him but he would not listen, so she cut her hair and wrote "Hanping" in large characters before committing suicide. Consort Lou's tomb is still located on the banks of the Gan River, alongside the poor people. The tomb is desolate, and only a few pillars remain of the archway. The stone lions have broken legs and are lying on the ground.</p>
<p>Zhongzheng Bridge Under Repair with Donations</p>
<p>The famous Tengwang Pavilion has also disappeared. Only one horizontal inscribed board is still left in the Tengwang Pavilion Elementary School on Porcelain Street. In the Water Police Headquarters next to the elementary school, a few stone stools can still be found. And on Porcelain Street, not a single porcelain shop can be found. The scenic spots and historical sites in Nanchang are very dilapidated. The Zhongzheng Bridge, which is a kilometer long, is extremely dilapidated. It is said that the locals are raising funds to repair it.</p>
<p>There are thirty to forty porcelain shops in Nanchang, and the major business is still in Jiujiang. Rice costs 400,000 yuan per dan, which is relatively cheap. However, the common people do not have large-scale production methods and are still very poor. This year's harvest is 80% for early rice and 60-70% for late rice. This is the situation in eastern Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Building a Bridge, Repairing the Main Artery</p>
<p>In Nanchang, we met Ouyang Cheng, the director of the Third Bridge Engineering Office of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. He wanted us to visit the Gan River Bridge project, but we could not go due to time constraints. However, the Gan River Bridge is the only major bridge on the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. In the current era of Jiangxi's vast land and sparse population, and in the poor situation of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, they are eager to repair this artery to revive Jiangxi. This spirit is admirable. (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Police-Bandit Battle Near Xiaoji Mountain in Wuxi, Five Robbers Killed, One Robber Sentenced to Immediate Execution</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 5th] The "Yihuang" Ding Shan scheduled boat of the Rong Sen Steamboat Bureau of Tonghui Bridge in this county, towing a "Anzai" tugboat, carrying more than 70 passengers, sailed from Yixing Ding Shan to Wuxi on the 4th of this month. At noon, it stopped at the Hutai Town wharf in the Outang Bridge area to pick up passengers. Unexpectedly, six people dressed in plain clothes and military uniforms, hiding short guns, mixed in with the passengers. When the boat reached Anqiao, they took out their pistols, intimidated the passengers, and checked their identity cards, arbitrarily searching and looting. None of the passengers on the boat were spared. They were robbed of cash, gold rings, etc., with losses of more than 100 million yuan. The bandits fled towards Zhangshe Shamao Bridge. The Zhangshe self-defense team immediately sent many members to tail them. They encountered the bandits in the area from Hutai Town to Yaowan, and a fierce battle broke out. The bandits could not hold out and retreated. At that time, the fifth bus of the Jiangnan Automobile Company arrived from Wuxi. The five bandits jumped into the bus and forced the driver to drive away at high speed. One bandit was slightly slower in his movements and was captured by the self-defense team. A No. 2 homemade box gun was found on him. He was interrogated in the district. The five criminals got off at Zhangshan Mouth in Jiangxiang, which is near Tai Lake. It happened that there were two Huangshi boats moored there. The five bandits took their stolen goods and boarded the boats, forcing them to flee towards Xiaoji Mountain. Yao Shangzhi, the captain of the second team of the Tai Lake Water Police Bureau, found out about this. He immediately took the "Kangqing" gunboat and pursued them on the lake near Xiaoji Mountain. He finally caught up with the five bandits. The bandits fired their guns, and the police team responded with machine gun fire. As a result, the five bandits were killed on the spot. The boat owner, Xi Fuxing, was shot three times in his legs and arms, and his son, Xiangnan, was shot in the instep. They were sent to a public hospital for treatment and are not in life-threatening condition. Three of the bandits fell into the center of the lake, and two bandits were found dead on the boat. The stolen money of 5 million yuan and three short guns were found on the boat and sent to Wujin County for verification. The bandit captured in Yaowan was sent to the county government from the Oucang Bridge District Office on the 4th. He was interrogated by Judge Liu Cheng. According to his confession, he was Chen Shizhu, 35 years old, from Wenjiang, Sichuan. He previously served as a platoon leader in the Transportation Company of the 5th Regiment of the 435th Brigade of the 21st Army. He retired in Nanjing in 1945 and transferred to the 23rd Company of the 5th Battalion of the 29th Army Officer Corps for training. He retired in April of this year and went to live in Xiaoshan, Zhejiang. On the 2nd of this month, he arrived in Wuxi and stayed in room 9 of the Zhonghua Hotel. On the morning of the 3rd, he and five classmates, Tang Weiming, Luo Jun, Zhang Jun, and Peng Tianmin, unsuccessfully robbed the Ding Shan scheduled boat. After hearing the confession, Judge Liu Cheng presented it to the county magistrate for review, Xu Shi Chang believed that the bandit was a soldier, committed armed robbery, and the crime was inexcusable. He sentenced him to death in court and sent someone to Zhen on the 5th with the document to present it to the provincial security commander for approval.</p>

<h3>Husband an Army Officer, Wife Works as a Guide, Female Xu Junye Attempts Suicide and Is Rescued</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 5th] Xu Junye, a member of the 17th Army Officer Corps, has been in the army for many years and has served as a lieutenant colonel battalion commander, etc. After being reorganized last year, he married Li Jingying, who is from Kunming and a high school graduate.

<h3>The Origin of British Football (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Le Xiurong</p>
<p>In November of the same year (1863), the second meeting was held at the same location. The first president of the Football Association, Arthur Pember, presided, and the first secretary, E.C. Morley, reported that he was working hard to obtain the cooperation of the major schools. He hoped that everyone could adopt the rules of the conference, "so that matches between the clubs can be arranged, because many new clubs are about to be established."</p>
<p>Most of the time in the early stages of the meeting was spent concentrating on and comparing the different rules of the clubs in order to formulate a "football rule" that could be accepted by the public. After heated discussions and arguments, a draft of the rules was successfully completed on November 24, 1863.</p>
<p>The first to express acceptance of this irregular rule was the Royal Engineers Football Club of Jithai, which played a crucial role in the early stages of the British Football Cup.</p>
<p>These rules were not universally accepted. Later, the Cambridge University Football Club offered a set of rules that included many of the key points of football in the simplest way, so there was a need for continued consultation. All thirteen original rules were changed, and on December 1, 1863, the rules of the British-style club were officially produced. This day is a memorable day in the history of the Football Association, from which it could play its role as an organization managing football matches and arranging matches between clubs.</p>
<p>In the early years, there were only friendly matches. Later, there was an obvious need for elimination matches. The British Football Association created and held this historic "British Football Association Challenge Cup" FA．Challenge Cup, (this cup is still held annually in Britain)</p>

<h3>Domestic Cotton Supply Meets Yarn Mill Demand; Shortage of Only 2 Million Bales This Year; Mostly Can Be Obtained Through US Cotton Loans</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] An authority in the textile and cotton industry in this city yesterday made an accurate estimate of the current state of raw cotton production and sales and cotton yarn production in our country, regarding the amount of raw cotton needed by our country. According to the talk, it was originally estimated that 6 million bales of ginned cotton could be harvested this cotton season (from September this year to the end of August next year). Due to the impact of military affairs, the estimated actual harvest has been reduced to 5 million bales. Of these 5 million bales, the amount that various factories have already purchased has reached 1.5 million bales. If the current military situation remains unchanged, at least 3.5 million bales can still be collected before the new cotton comes on the market next year, totaling 5 million bales. If 1 million bales of adulteration are further deducted, the estimated actual purchase of ginned cotton in the coming year can reach 4 million bales. If the current military situation progresses well, there is still hope for an increase in the purchase volume.</p>
<p>During this cotton season, the target production of cotton yarn nationwide is 1.8 million pieces of various yarns. Due to power outages and other obstacles, the estimated maximum production this year is about 1.7 million pieces. Based on the need for 400 catties of cotton per piece, the annual total demand for raw cotton is nearly 7 million bales. Compared with the domestic possible supply of 4 million bales of cotton, there is a shortage of about 3 million bales.</p>
<p>For now, the existing cotton stocks of various factories and the United Relief Agency's cotton will all be regarded as cotton stocks and will not be used to offset the shortage. Of the 3 million bales of ginned cotton lacking, 1/10 of the annual yarn and cloth production can be exported, which can be exchanged for 1 million bales of cotton. Therefore, the actual cotton shortage is only about 2 million bales, equivalent to more than 400,000 packages.</p>
<p>According to sources, these 400,000 packages of cotton will mostly be obtained from the nearly mature US cotton loan. Mr. Towson, the Commercial Counselor of the US Embassy, has recently exchanged views with the leaders of the cotton spinning industry in this city to inquire about the types of US cotton needed. As most of the raw cotton that can be purchased in our country today is raw material for 20-count yarn or below, the 400,000 or more packages of foreign cotton will still need to be dominated by fine-staple raw materials. According to experts, roughly 200,000 packages will need to be 7/8's of that time, and 100,000 packages each will need to be one time or more, in order to cooperate with the purchased domestic cotton to meet the needs of the domestic textile industry, it is said.</p>
<h3>Gold Control Bureau to Be Established Next Week; Director Li Talks About Control Principles: "Government and Business Are Both Controlled, Chinese and Foreign Are Treated Equally"</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The newly appointed Director of the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and Chief of the Audit Office of the Central Bank, Mr. Li Lixia, was previously summoned by the central government and went to Beijing with Deputy Director Bi Delin to discuss various preparations before the establishment of the bureau. He returned to Shanghai after completing the official business yesterday morning. According to him, the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau is scheduled to be formally established and start work within the next week. The bureau will be located on the fourth floor of the Central Bank at No. 24 The Bund. According to the organizational regulations, the bureau will have two offices: Auditing and Secretariat. The Chief Auditor will be concurrently held by the Deputy Director, and the candidate for Chief Secretary has not yet been determined. As for the staffing establishment, it will strive for simplicity, with a maximum of no more than 40 people. All of them will be transferred from the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, and no new people will be added. The recurring expenses are very small. He also said that the main mission of the bureau is to increase production and combat speculation in order to stabilize the financial order and stabilize people's livelihoods. As for the control method, the principle of "government and business are both controlled, and Chinese and foreign are treated equally" will be adopted. In other words, all financial institutions, whether commercial or state-run, and whether Chinese or foreign, will be subject to control. Those who violate the regulations will be punished and will not be tolerated. When asked about the contents of the bureau's financial management methods, he said that the Ministry of Finance has now drafted a simple and feasible method for controlling financial business, and the content is very complete. Once it is announced, the bureau will immediately follow it and implement it. Also, before the establishment of the bureau, the financial inspection work in this city will continue to be carried out by the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with the Central Bank, and will not be suspended for a day. After the bureau is established, it will be uniformly managed by the bureau. Finally, Mr. Li said that the work of managing finance is quite difficult, and he deeply hopes that all citizens will assist the bureau in order to achieve complete success.</p>

Subsequently, due to favorable news, both domestic and foreign merchants were active, and external upward pressure was also strong, presenting a firm market. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially traded at 48 million, rising to 49.2 million, but then, due to financial constraints among industry participants, sales were made at high prices, and concerns arose that Fangjian would resume yarn allocation next week, causing sentiment to falter, with many selling, leading to lower prices. By the close, prices had retreated to 48.2 million yuan, an increase of 1.2 million yuan over the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also retreated by 200,000 to 1.1 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Welcoming the Xinjiang Youth Song and Dance Troupe</h3>
<p>We cherish the memory of Xinjiang, the snow-capped mountains that stretch for thousands of miles, the boundless deserts and grasslands! For thousands of years, this magnificent land has nurtured the wisdom of the Chinese nation and accumulated resources. Among those high mountains and deserts, in the fruit tree forests of the Tianshan Mountains, the people of Xinjiang are creating new hope for this generation through culture, art, and music. The stage of history has taken away Xinjiang's worries and disasters, ignorance and poverty. The atmosphere of freedom and progress is making them, like us, move towards the goal of building a democratic China. Now, the young men and women of Xinjiang have come to Shanghai from the remote western frontier. They will tell you many stories of the grasslands in their uninhibited melodies, and they will also pour out the dramatic changes of ancient cities in the last hundred years in their light dance steps. The tunes composed by those iron flutes, simple boards, and light strings are entirely clear sounds nurtured by the endless oil, coal, iron, livestock, and forests! Please support this magnificent sound with sincere praise! This sound contains the vision of a united and self-strengthening China! (The troupe has been performing at the Quanhou Theater at 9 PM every night since December 6th.)</p>

<h3>"Spokesperson"</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>In the past, politicians were good at adhering to the maxim "governing is not about talking much," the purpose being "the people can be made to follow, but not to know." On the one hand, this could also be used to "cover up clumsiness" and avoid many troubles.</p>
<p>Now is the democratic era, and the method of "not allowing them to know" is naturally not feasible. To talk about democracy, the first thing is to enlighten the people's wisdom. And to enlighten the people's wisdom, in modern political science terms, is called propaganda. Thus, "spokespersons" of all sizes of institutions were born.</p>
<p>According to psychologists' analysis, people's temperament differs due to different psychological influences (some say it's due to different endocrine secretions), with so-called introversion and extroversion. But whether introverted or extroverted, the desire for fame is the same. The so-called desire for fame, in modern language, is to have others "understand" your merits. "No one below the Three Dynasties did not desire fame," so propaganda, although a product of the democratic era, has been around for a long time.</p>
<p>Since propaganda is not a bad thing, the position of "spokesperson" is of course worthy of respect; whether the words you speak represent yourself or your duties, as long as your words are reasonable, and more importantly, substantive, you have fulfilled the responsibility of "spokesperson."</p>
<p>However, good things often become unrecognizable in the hands of those with ulterior motives. Since the purpose of propaganda is to enlighten the people's wisdom, the first thing is to avoid lying. However, Goebbels, the "spokesperson" of Hitler, who committed suicide by poisoning, once said: "A lie repeated constantly will become the truth." In other words, if you repeat a lie over and over again, people will accept it as a fact.</p>
<p>It is absurd to use propaganda as a tool for lying. However, to deceive the masses temporarily, treating lying as the essence of propaganda may be necessary. However, the Nazis ultimately failed in their large-scale lies to the world.</p>
<p>Getting back to the topic, the inherent meaning of propaganda is indeed beyond reproach, but perhaps because everyone uses this tool too extensively, when seeing some unreliable statements or overly exaggerated advertisements, people always say it's just "propaganda propaganda." The implication is that as soon as something has a propaganda color, it is considered untrustworthy. Isn't this too far from the essence of propaganda?</p>
<h3>Idle Talk about "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" and the Like</h3>
<p>— Si Guo</p>
<p>The writing in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" cannot be considered not beautiful, but good structures are only found in intact short stories. However, I once suspected that with Pu Liuxian's such brilliant writing skills, why did he prefer to talk about foxes and ghosts when he could write anything? I didn't find some roots for this until I came into contact with the theory of psychoanalysis. "Strange Tales" and similar works have many psychological backgrounds that can be proposed for research.</p>
<p>First of all, we can imagine that a poor painting enthusiast's curiosity about the opposite sex is no less than that of anyone else. At that time, the Catholic concept of holiness was not yet widespread, and in a situation where society did not value men's chastity and social interaction between men and women was not open, how did scholars accustomed to daydreaming vent their inner distress? This was a very serious matter. Writing about romantic encounters with foxes and ghosts under such circumstances, just as a child cursing someone as a "puppy" is like seeing that person as a puppy, can satisfy the heart a little; although empty, it is also a vent. Therefore, talented people like Pu Liuxian borrowed legends to use the fickle (especially transformed into beautiful women) foxes to solve his emotional distress. Foxes and ghosts gave him the greatest convenience and satisfaction; because they only appeared at night, they would not be seen, and there were no fathers, brothers, or husbands to accuse him of damaging customs and harming families, etc., and committing romantic affairs did not violate the law. It was really the cheapest thing in the world, there was nothing more than this! If an old scholar sees a beautiful (actually not necessarily beautiful, maybe the scholar is nearsighted and can't see clearly) neighbor girl during the day and can't get rid of her when he returns home, writing a few erotic poems is not enough, he can write another ghost story.</p>
<p>From a philosophical point of view, life is inherently painful, and now with ghosts and foxes, pain is no longer to be feared. Just look at how the old can return to youth, the separated can meet immediately, and the lover in one's heart can unite with her unconditionally... and it becomes clear. Since literature allows people freedom of imagination, it naturally cannot refuse people from writing about foxes and ghosts. There are also myths in Western literature, which are partially similar to this.</p>
<p>Since foxes and ghosts are omnipotent, they naturally become knights who steal from the rich to help the poor and eliminate violence and bring peace in this dark society. The popularity of Daoist and martial arts novels stems from the same reason. Furthermore, the Buddhist theory of reincarnation was originally deeply rooted among the people, and scholars who were compassionate or could not stand the corruption of officials and gentry placed infinite hope on ghosts and foxes. To warn bad people, they exaggerated retribution; to vent righteous indignation, they wrote about bad people getting bad results. Regardless of the effect, at least the motive is similar to preaching, which is to supplement what is lacking in the king's transformation. This also shows that Chinese scholars cannot do things actively, but can only passively "persuade people to do good."</p>
<p>There are also difficulties that prevent scholars from doing active things. For example, the Qing Dynasty's suspicion of the Han people made people always want to preserve their lives, and the psychology of avoiding disaster enveloped every scholar. There were many words in their hearts that they wanted to say but could not say happily, so they could only talk about foxes and ghosts. Although the emperor was not happy with those who pointed out the gains and losses of politics or even advocated new things, he sometimes not only did not object to talking about absurd and strange things, but even found it interesting. By the way, it can be said that the old-fashioned scholarship of the Qing Dynasty also achieved great achievements under the psychology of avoiding disaster.</p>
<p>Talking about ghosts and foxes can not only avoid disaster, but also be used to scold people by taking the opportunity. In Western literature, like "Gulliver's Travels," it is satirical, but Ji Xiaolan's tool for scolding Song Confucian scholars was ghosts.</p>
<p>These types of works should spread more easily than cholera because they fit people's tastes. Those who can write want to write, and those who can't write let them. People's talents found an outlet in this type of work, and on the one hand, it was happy and harmless, no wonder there were more people following Pu Liuxian.</p>
<h3>Shop for Sale</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>In the classified ads of the New York Herald Tribune, there is an ad in the "Shop for Sale" column that reads: "Supplement Factory for Sale—Products can cure all diseases, with a long-standing reputation, now for sale because the owner is ill."</p>
<h3>Genius</h3>
<p>— Li Yuwen</p>
<p>A young mother and her child stood on a street corner, her hand pointing from the child's shoulder to a man sitting in a car, saying, "This is Albert Einstein, don't forget, you have seen him."</p>
<p>She pointed out a short, stout little man with a dignified face and a thick head of white hair. He is the well-known contemporary great scientist, the inventor of relativity, the father of the atomic age, and also a humorous, friendly, frank, humble, and simple person.</p>
<p>There are many stories about Einstein, here are a few of them, from which it can be fully explained why Einstein has been praised by people for so long.</p>
<p>Einstein's home in Princeton is a simple two-story house, but it was once equipped with an elevator. A friend heard that this stupid business had actually succeeded, and went to ask him: "Good heavens, Abe, why did you install an elevator?"</p>
<p>"I don't know either," Einstein replied, "It's just that the business-grabbing gentleman was so kind that I couldn't refuse!"</p>
<p>Einstein's neighbor had a little girl who became very friendly with the great mathematician. She went to see him almost every afternoon. The little girl's mother felt strange and ran to ask the professor what they were talking about.</p>
<p>"Oh," Einstein replied, "She gives me cakes to eat every day, and she asks me to do her arithmetic homework for her."</p>
<p>Once, when Einstein was invited to meet the Belgian royal family, the welcoming party went to the train station to greet him. Cars and drivers were prepared, and servants were sorting luggage, but they couldn't find Einstein. It turned out that he had quietly walked off the train, carrying his suitcase, and walking to the palace.</p>
<p>Einstein explained to these surprised people very simply, saying, "I like to walk."</p>
<h3>Integrity</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>The Biography of Xue Xuan in the History of Ming Dynasty states: Xuan was promoted to censor after passing the imperial examination. The Three Yangs (Yang Rong, Yang Shiqi, and Yang Pu were all Grand Secretaries at the time, historically known as the Three Yangs) wanted to meet him, Xuan said: "I am in charge of impeachment, it is righteous not to know each other." He refused to meet. The Three Yangs praised him endlessly, saying, "Even seeing Master Xue is impossible, let alone be submissive to him?" With the prestige of a prime minister, wanting to condescend to meet a censor, in the eyes of ordinary people, would be considered the highest honor, but Master Xue was afraid that after meeting, it would be difficult to avoid developing feelings. With feelings, it would be difficult to impeach. So, he simply refused to meet, so as to avoid the dilemma of being in a difficult position in case of impeachment in the future. His strictness was such that later generations of historians could not help but admire him. Also, the Notes from Willow South Record: When Zhou Xiangguo Yushou from Yixing was young, he studied with Mr. Huang Jiezi. Mr. Huang praised him extremely. When Yushou later lived in the village after passing the high-level imperial examination, he was quite unbridled. Mr. Huang heard of this and was not happy. Later, Yushou went to visit Mr. Huang for something. Mr. Huang firmly lay in bed and refused to get up. When he knelt in front of the bed to beg forgiveness, Mr. Huang suddenly got up and slapped his cheek, saying, "You have just obtained your teeth, and you are already harming the village!" His strictness was comparable to Master Xue's refusal to meet the Three Yangs. I say that this is not only the upright spirit of Master Xue and Master Huang that fills the four poles, but also the praise of the Three Yangs and Zhou's willingness to endure pain are enough to be examples for future generations. As for Chen Ziqiang of the Song Dynasty, who was originally the teacher of Han Tuozhou, when Tuozhou became noble, Ziqiang relied on him, even calling him "Benefactor King" and "Benefactor Father." One called him without knowing shame, and the other responded without a sense of shame. His meanness and vulgarity made people vomit for three days. Compared to the two above-mentioned gentlemen, can they not be ashamed to death!</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Inspecting a Pavilion: The Weng-Li Feud in Late Qing Political Strife (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yu Shou</p>
<p>In the forty years before the Qing Dynasty's demise, because the Manchus were mostly foolish and ignorant of affairs, Han officials gradually gained power. "Those who eat from the same trough will inevitably bite each other," so party strife was unavoidable. One of the most famous examples was the Weng-Li feud during the mid-Guangxu period.</p>
<p>Weng refers to Weng Tonghe from Changshu, and Li refers to Li Hongzao from Gaoyang (father of the current Central Committee member Li Yuying). At that time, both were in the Grand Council, and both were known for their ability to nurture talent and their strong fighting spirit. These figures each held a political and literary position in the following decades and were known as the "Qingliu" (pure stream). A list is provided below:</p>
<p>Gaoyang Faction:</p>
<p>Zhang Youqiao (Peilun)</p>
<p>Zhang Xiangtao (Zhidong)</p>
<p>Chen Tao'an (Baochen)</p>
<p>Huang Shulan (Tifang)</p>
<p>Changshu Faction:</p>
<p>Sheng Boyi (Yu)</p>
<p>Wang Kezhuang (Renkan)</p>
<p>Shen Zipei (Qiuzhi)</p>
<p>Zhang Lizhi (Yu)</p>
<p>Wen Yunge (Tingshi)</p>
<p>Changshu entered the Grand Council later than Gaoyang (in the eighth year of Guangxu). At that time, the Manchu Prince Bingzheng relied on Gaoyang for support. However, the Empress Dowager Cixi's perception of Prince Gong had changed. Changshu, knowing this hidden sentiment, directed his cultivated scholars to first attack Gaoyang, and then Prince Gong. The initiator was Sheng Boyi, known as the "Master of the Huage Pavilion" from the imperial clan. As a result, Prince Gong and his "hem ha generals" Baojun and Li Hongzao were all dismissed from the Grand Council overnight (Weng was also removed from the Grand Council at the same time), falling into disgrace for ten years without being able to rise again. At the time, many suspected this was a plot by Prince Chun, and that Changshu was allied with Prince Chun, thus not hesitating to grab chestnuts from the fire. In reality, Prince Gong and Li's removal was due to the Empress Dowager Cixi's personal emotional changes. Changshu's attack succeeded simply because it coincided with the opportunity. The Empress Dowager certainly did not favor the Changshu faction. Looking at the following ten years, there was no significant advancement or retreat for either faction in terms of personnel. Moreover, Zhang Youqiao was appointed to handle Fujian coastal defense affairs in the same year, not shrinking back because of Gaoyang's downfall (the defeat in the Battle of Mawei and the subsequent reprimand occurred a year later).</p>
<p>However, later, individuals from both factions attacked each other in their diaries and manuscripts. The vulgarity of their language was akin to that of street thugs (which will be excerpted below), fully exposing the narrow-mindedness, obstinacy, and other bad habits of the old Chinese scholar-official class. Even the wise Cangqu Old Man (Chen Tao'an), in his "Four Poems on Spring," slandered Changshu without leaving any room for reconciliation. Reading it fifty years later, one seems to still hear his yelping.</p>
<p>In the twentieth year of Guangxu, both Prince Gong and Gaoyang rose again. At that time, Guangxu gradually began to manage affairs, and Changshu was able to stay in office. However, Prince Gong and Gaoyang had been frustrated for many years and had lost their sharp spirit, unable to seek revenge. Weng Changshu wrote in his diary on November 1, year 22 of Guangxu, "Prince Gong requested a reward for Li, but it was not granted. After Gaoyang's illness, walking is extremely difficult. Today, when entering the audience, he had to be supported and still could not stand steadily. It is worrying." His words contained a hint of mockery. This was 1896 in the Gregorian calendar (Gaoyang died half a year later). At that time, Li Shizeng may still have been tying a red velvet braid and reciting "guan guan ju jiu" at home.</p>
<h3>Talking About Toothaches</h3>
<p>— Guangjue</p>
<p>Recently, my teeth have been hurting again, as if I'm back in my childhood.</p>
<p>When I was little, I loved to eat sugary treats. My mother didn't know how to teach me oral hygiene, and my teeth were riddled with cavities. I knew that there were two sets of teeth, and at first, I thought that if the first set was ruined, the second set would definitely be good. I didn't expect that if the first set was bad, the second set would also be bad.</p>
<p>When I was losing my teeth, I always ran to my grandfather, who practiced Chinese medicine. As soon as I opened my mouth to him, he knew what I wanted. He would take a look, know which one needed to be pulled, stick two fingers in, grab the ruined tooth, and tell me to "qiang!" I would say "qiang!" and the ruined tooth would be in my grandfather's hand. He would always ask, "It doesn't hurt at all, right?" Actually, it hurt a little, but I always said it didn't hurt at all. Then, my grandmother would tell me to throw the upper teeth that were pulled out under the rice husk, and throw the lower teeth that were pulled out onto the eaves. It was as if this would ensure that the new teeth that came out later would be perfect, but it just didn't work.</p>
<p>By the time I was ten or so, toothaches had become a chronic problem. When it hurt, my mother would only give me a raw egg and tell me to roll it on my face. Twenty years ago, it seems that even aspirin, which treated headaches for head pain and toothaches for tooth pain, hadn't reached our countryside. Sometimes, they told me to put a small Japanese "Jintan" pill in the cavity. It was fine at first, but after a while, it hurt even more.</p>
<p>In university, it started hurting again. This time, of course, I had to consult some dental doctor who had studied in Germany or Japan. One doctor examined me and said it would cost ten silver dollars to pull one and fill one, and I agreed. This young doctor pulled a slightly decayed but strong old tooth, which I still resent to this day. When he pulled it, he broke out in a sweat, mobilized his friend who shared the consulting room with him, and the female nurses all looked at each other in dismay. I lost too much blood and almost fainted in front of my classmates when I got back to school. The false tooth he fitted for me was clamped between two teeth, and it was very unstable. I simply threw it away, which caused my upper teeth to loosen up one by one, as if they were lining up and looking to the right. They weren't very good-looking to begin with, and now they were even less so. However, in any case, the doctor extracted the nerve and filled one tooth with silver amalgam, which he said would last for three years. In fact, it's been fourteen or fifteen years now, and it still hasn't decayed.</p>
<h3>Xiaoyao Flower (Free and Easy Flower)</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter 2: A Gentle Chat (7)</p>
<p>Master Zhu treats me so well, just like his own daughter. He tells me everything he knows and always reminds me of my mistakes. At that time, my father formed his own troupe, and the troupe lacked a second female role. Many people suggested that I take on the role, but my father refused. Only after Mr. Zhu and Mr. Xu strongly recommended me did he agree to let me try. I remember one evening, my father's play was "The Battle of Taiping," and there were over eight hundred people in the audience. My father was very happy. My play that day was "Wu Jia Po," which was scheduled as the finale. When "Wu Jia Po" finished and "The Battle of Taiping" had just started, one-third of the audience left. My father then realized why the audience was so enthusiastic and said with great emotion, "Old plays are not popular these days. I never thought that a girl could attract such a crowd!" From then on, he told me to focus on learning the plays diligently. Under the guidance of Mr. Zhu and Mr. Xu, I learned all of Mei Lanfang's plays, including "The Tale of Taizhen," "Life and Death Regret," and "The Goddess of Luo." Seeing my progress, my father had high expectations for me. At that time, Zhang Xiaojuan came to Beijing from Shanghai to perform. The second female role she brought, Ma Yanyun, fell ill. Xiaojuan asked Xu Guifen to find her a replacement. Because Xiaojuan was Mr. Xu's favorite student, Mr. Xu thought of me. He asked Master Zhu to talk to me, asking me to cooperate with Xiaojuan and help out for two weeks. I thought that Mr. Xu had treated me very well, and he always taught me plays without asking for anything in return. I couldn't refuse this favor. Moreover, cooperating with Xiaojuan would give me more experience, which would be very beneficial to me. So, I told my father, and he agreed very readily.</p>
<p>A few days later, he heard something from someone and said to me, "This play must not be performed. Someone is trying to sabotage our Gu Family Troupe." Because I had already agreed to Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhu, and they had already made arrangements, I couldn't go back on my word. I repeatedly stated that cooperating with Xiaojuan would not conflict with the Gu Family Troupe at all, because people who watched kunqu (female role) plays were a different crowd. My father didn't agree with this and scolded me, smashed a lot of things, and in a fit of anger, canceled the play that was posted at the Jixiang Theater. He also announced that the Gu Family Troupe would be disbanded from now on. At that time, I was supposed to cooperate with Xiaojuan in the play "Si Lang Visits His Mother," and the playbill had already been posted at the Guangde Building. How could I tell Mr. Xu this? I was so anxious and felt so embarrassed. Later, I asked my father's good friend, Wang Shoushan, to explain to my father again and again. My father only allowed me to perform one show with Xiaojuan on the first day, and not to perform again after that. On the morning of the first day of the performance, Xiaojuan invited me and my brother to have lunch together at Tonghe Restaurant to strengthen our friendship. Unexpectedly, my brother saw Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhu present and expressed his dissatisfaction to them. Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhu then realized that because I was performing with Xiaojuan, my family had been in turmoil. My brother's words implied that he blamed Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhu for ruining the relationship between my father and me. Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhu didn't say anything at the time. After the joint performance that evening, Master Zhu said to me the next day, "There are a lot of rumors outside, so it's not convenient for us to teach you plays anymore. You should find another teacher."</p>

<h3>Remembering the Life of Repatriated Overseas Chinese from Southern Sakhalin Island: The Central Government Decides to Discuss Relief Measures with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Other Departments</h3>
<p>Reading the news about the repatriated overseas Chinese from Southern Sakhalin Island published in your newspaper on the 28th brought tears to my eyes! Can we turn a deaf ear and a blind eye to the plight of our compatriots? Can we bear to let these brothers and sisters who have returned from afar, cherishing their homeland, prefer to endure the tyrannical abuse of foreign countries? Think about the joy and admiration for the motherland when they left Southern Sakhalin Island, and the hope of quickly crossing the vast ocean to return and join hands with their own brothers. Can we abandon them? Please continue to report on their situation; Please publish articles urging the government to come up with a solution for them; Please hold a fundraising campaign for them. Although I am extremely poor, I am willing to cut back on food and clothing to donate. We are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and I believe there are many sympathetic people. Your newspaper has been striving for 75 years, and you gentlemen have never lagged behind in public welfare and charitable causes. I hope you will accept this request from a reader. I believe this is more meaningful than the daily news about Xiao Danggui in various newspapers. Sincerely, A Reader To the editors of Shen Bao</p>
<p>[Editor's Note] We deeply sympathize with the above suggestion. According to recent news, the matter has been jointly discussed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Executive Headquarters, and a decision was made on the 2nd of this month, with the Ministry of Social Affairs taking overall responsibility for handling it. Three measures were agreed upon: The 161 overseas Chinese will continue to temporarily reside in the former Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road; The food problem will be handled by Xu Yong, Deputy Director of the Relief Division of the Executive Headquarters; The Ministry of Social Affairs will send a special person to Shanghai to supervise and manage the work, and to investigate the number of overseas Chinese who are employed and returning to their hometowns, and then decide on other measures. As mentioned above, we can rest assured and optimistically await the results.</p>
