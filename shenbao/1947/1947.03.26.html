<h3>何思源在京談話　平清查戶口眞相　共黨陰謀暴動確鑿有據</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕關於二二月十八日北平憲警機關淸查戶口，拘捕若干人犯詳情，北平市何市長思源，廿五日返平前告記者如下：「在二二月十八日以前一週期間，共軍曾有下列暴動恐怖行為：（一）化裝農商，潛入距北平二十公里之通縣，乘夜間佔居縣城，焚燒房屋，殘殺人民，並在北平永定門外二公里處擾亂。（二）破壞供給北平自來水，電車，電台電源之發電廠。（三）搶刧平津鐵路特別快車，轟炸鐵道橋樑，使平津火車二日不通。（四）揚言進攻北平，北平城內潛伏共黨間牒，廿一日共軍擾亂近郊時，嗚槍響應，市民一夕數驚。（五）共黨間諜陰謀暴動，屢次發生搶案，並有美軍官一名，在北平街上被擊斃。斯時北平已陷戰時恐怖狀態，平保沿綫徐水保定附近大戰正烈，北平人民及新聞界紛紛請求政府，迅謀對策，戶口情查即係根據此種情形而舉行者。二月十八日，北平警察局舉行全市戶口淸查，共查出漏報戶口者一一六五起，無國民身份證者一七六起，期傳至警局，令其補辦手絞後，於二十四小時內放還，又烟毒犯一一四起，私藏軍火犯五一起，賭城犯一八一起，亦均於二十四軍事機關，此等人犯多數業經依法處罰後釋放。另有七人自供為中共黨員，犯企圖暗殺，放火破壞鐵路，破壞水電之罪，確鑿有據，均將依法懲罰。其中一人，名王　銓，爲清華學生，自認參加共黨暴動陰謀，因其為靑年學生，已准由學校當局保釋。其名單及處罰情形，必要時，余返北平後可予宣布。唯於一百八十萬人口之犬城市中，舉行檢查，技術上之困難殆無法避免，如國學家符定一，牙醫生一人，警後救濟總署女職員一人，即係由於技術上困難而演成之誤會，但一經證明，立予開釋，余本人並親往慰問。至外傳逮捕大批自由份子，乃共產黨宣傳慣技，茍有人能舉出姓名，何人為自由份十而被逮捕，余當立即查明，宣布其眞相。當時情勢十分緊張，故未能預先請示中央。對陰謀暴動，擾亂治安，盜匪間諜，予以法律制裁，對私藏軍火，聚眾購博，不報戶口，冒名潛伏者，予以合法糾正，實為政府之職責，一般共黨外圍，對共軍毀路掘提，殘殺良民，暴動擾亂，默不一語，獨對政府為維護人民生命財產之合法行政行為，而呌囂反對，實非眞正自由份子所應有之態度」。</p>

<p>國民大會組織法革案，業經廿五日晨立法院四屆三一九次例會通過，國大代表選舉罷免法草案，會中亦會加以討論，惟因其中尚有留待研討之點，決議送憲法法規委會檢討，定廿七日第三二零次例會提出。本日會義由孫院長主席，開會後，全體為新近逝世立委張鳳九默哀，繼即討論國大組織法，由憲法法規委會委長劉克　說明，略謂：審查結果。與國防委會原案北無多大出入之處、第四條，第十條僅作文字修正，第十三條原案有糾儀員一人，副科儀二人之設立，眾主席之命，維持義場秩序，審查時，因恐干涉不當，發生科紛，主張予以取消，第十四條（原十五條），國大每次集會，於任務終後自行閉會，改為任務終了時即行閉會。</p>
<p>呂委員復發言，認憲法法規關係重大，研討時應不厭求詳，從長計　，不可草率從事，孫九錄亦有同感，惟劉克僑認根據憲法實施準備程序，各種有關憲法法規，應於憲法公布後三個月後制定，會中當決定繼續討論。</p>
<p>各立委對國民大會應吾設置糾儀一點，爭辯甚烈，孫院長指出其他國家皆有糾儀之設置，惟在我國則屬初創。林彬等認主席若能發揮力量，秩序不難維持，設置糾　後，若因干涉不當，反足引起騷動，不予設置亦無不可。夏爾康亦認爲設糾儀後，秩序或更易騷亂。</p>
<p>簡貫三等認有設置必要，指出三千人左右之會塲，若無糾儀員，秩序之紊亂，為可以意料者，盛振為亦認實行民主，須先養成守秩序為習慣，若無糾儀，主席與代表間將直接發生衝突。</p>
<p>陳顧遠等提出折衷辦法，或主由紀律委員會於代表中選派之，或主由主席　兼任，最後表決，仍照審查意見通過，國大不設糾議員。</p>
<p>另一爭持問題為主席團名額，林彬為根據過去經騐，主席團人數過多，並無多大好處，惟廿五人之數，可路增加。趙逎傳認無增加必要，陳茹玄認有一正主席，一。二副主席即足。表決時仍照原案通過，國大設主席團，由出席代表互選廿五人組織之。</p>
<p>國代選舉罷免法草案　已送憲法規會研究</p>
<p>國大會期應否規定一點，王毓祥認應予規定，鐘天心認組織法中若規定憲法所未規定之事項，難免不有連憲之嫌，林彬說明將來召　國大，事由不一致，任務不同，會期自異，先作硬性規定，不甚妥當。決定照審查意見通過。</p>
<p>繼討論國大代表選舉罷免法草案，劉克僑說明審查經過，指出主要爭議焦點為名額分配。關於第五條選舉人及被選舉人資格問題，原草案第一欶「　職罪」經審查後刪去，改第二款，曾服公務而有　汚行爲，經判決確定者，並增一款「吸用鴉片或其他代用品者」。第六條係涉及歸化人民選舉被選舉權者，原草案無被選舉　，現規定歸化滿十年，而合於規定者，宥被選舉權。第九條關於選舉人名冊，　草案規定僅有一本，易有損毀及僞造危險，審查時改為正副兩本，籍便查考。十二條規定被選眾入提名入數目，原案規定須經一百個候選人提名，當時曾考慮予以增加，後仍維原數，惟增加「或由政黨提名」。第三章係規定選舉機關之組織者，憲查後，於中央總選舉事務所外增設選舉委員會，並以選舉總盬督鬱為主席，當時若干立委認有委會後無須再設總監督，當時決　予以保留，留待大會決定。</p>
<p>報告畢，可徒總等發言，對選舉　稱規定提出三點疑問，（一）選舉總事務所，由法律定之，法律將如何予以規定，（二）先有選舉總藍督，而後有選舉委會，有人恐不願出任委員。〇渠本人不贊同　監督兼任委會主席。彭　士等對人口計算方法，，　示異議。簡眞二認　大代表　舉罷免　　立委選舉罷免法頗多不同之處，實有途交法規委會加以檢討必要，最後決議，先將該案送憲法法規委會，比照立委選舉罷免法研究後，再提廿七日例會公決。</p>

<p>〔本報徐州廿五日電〕魯西國軍廿四日下午二時收復東阿後，續向北追擊竄退之共軍，廿五日午已越過王　店，下午四時進入平陰。由東平向東北推進之團軍，廿四日收復黃山，葡萄山，東恒魚，五五日續向肥城西南十八里地區掃蕩中。由太汶口以西北上之國軍，己繞過大汶口北，於收復南留後，今日續收復津浦路西側之曹莊，滿莊，刻正直指滿安。</p>
<p>〔又電〕魯西戰局急轉直下，大汶河以北之國軍，日來對津浦路與黃河問三角地區之共軍，分三路作扇形推進，刻該地區之共軍劉伯誠殘部約兩萬餘人已成甕鱉，現黃河水深已逾五公尺，共軍欲渡河西竄已不可能。</p>
<p>〔中央社濟南二十五日電〕魯西國軍於二十四日收復東阿後，繼續向東北　蕩，本日分兩路前進，一部已到逢孔家莊（平險南），另一部到達石樓　口附近，前鋒部隊已指向肥城，該處國軍勢將提前與濟南王耀武部會師。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南廿五日電〕濟南外圍共軍現每晚連續向國軍陣地進攻，東北面戰事較緊張，該地共軍主力的一師之衆，廿四日晚九時一部攻郭店，一部攻王會人莊，並派人到郭店車站埋置地雷，圖炸國軍鋼甲車，國軍當奮勇反擊，並將圖炸鋼甲車之共軍擊跑，兩地竟夜激戰，迄廿五日拂曉，共軍先後潰退。當作戰時，共軍一股會衝至王舍人莊　域城縣政府東牆以外，卒被縣府保安部隊將其擊退，轉危為安。</p>
<p>〔又電〕向濟南外國郭店韓倉東西劉家莊來犯共軍，至廿五日晨已　國軍某有力部隊擊退，廿五日午後，黃河北桑梓店東南八里莊竄到共軍千餘人，經國軍鐵甲車擊退。共軍於屢遭挫敗之餘，仍調動頻繁，同時並在濟柬廿五公里龍山，濟北卅五公里夏口，濟西北四十公里禹城，運屯大批糧彈，似仍未放棄其圍攻濟南企圖。</p>
<h3>進犯通化共軍　全被擊退東竄</h3>

<h3>小豐滿輸電路　又遭共軍破壞</h3>

<h3>本年徵實及收購賦糧　浙省府條陳意見　如無實物控制不能濟荒</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿五日電〕沈主席昨自京返杭，今即出席省府會議。據沈氏稱：本年度中央仍將繼續征實，惟以交通便利，糧產豐富之地區為限，其餘則征法幣。微實所得應歸省之二成及應歸縣之五成，均由中央按本年七八九三月平均糧價收購。省府以此事關係重要，已派田糧處長陳詒於下午四時晋京，向糧部條陳意見：（一）交通便利及糧產　當之標準如何？（二）省縣所得實物，如全由中央購去，則省縣全無實物控制，不能濟荒。（三）七八九三月糧價較低，則本年省縣預算無法平衡，又如何可使征實縣份負担平分。</p>
<p>據省府消息：中央又擬改訂收支系統將歸中央之三成田賦及歸縣之營業稅五成劃交省府，中央對省不再補助。以此算法，則浙省府可增加收入一二〇億，但仍將不敷二四〇億，故已聯合各省府主席，兩財糧二部，請在憲法施行前，仍暫照現行辦法辦理，不必多所紛更。惟總裁己指示中央三成田賦不能改撥省府，則收支系統似不致即有變更。浙省三十六年度預算，財部已審查完畢照每石二萬五千六百元算，營業稅加三倍，因以表面上預算可平衡，但行政院尙未審查，聞其原則爲中央補助款不照上年數字伸算，如收支有差額，再予補助，故囑陳財廳長蜜麟陳會計長景陶留京，繼續交涉，財部虛列收數萬不能承認。又本省原列各事業費，恐均有被刪可能，亦囑交涉保留。惟中央已允許，此後公敎人員生活調整增加之支出，槪田中央撥補。</p>

<h3>讀三中全會宣言後</h3>
<p>中國國民黨六屆三中全會，於十五日開慕，廿四日閉幕：會後發表宣言，全文已誌昨日本報。這次大會，是國民黨廿年來空前重要的一次集會，是領導抗戰勝利還都，頒佈憲法結束訓政的一决集會。在開會時，蔣總裁指出這次全會的使命，在于從新釐定黨和政府的關係，革新國民黨，充實國民黨，期于結束訓政後，使黨仍能祖當起建國的責任。在宣言中，全會更列舉五大目標，勗勉黨人，昭告國人，為今後努力之要務。</p>
<p>國民黨為當前我國的第一大黨，數十年的革命奮鬥，一以貫之是實行孫中山先生的三民主義。它曾締造民國，打倒軍閥；領導抗戰勝利，廢除不平等條約：召開國民大會，完成民主的憲法；對國家民族的功勛，其光氣足以燭天地，貫日月而不朽。惟以訓政時期持久，吏治未完全澄淸，依草附木的人日多，不免流品很雜；加以國內黨派是非混亂，致痛論國是者對國民黨亦有毀譽，但國民黨却不在毀譽上討消息，而能自奮能革新，能振作能負責。如果人人能有與人為善的光明熊度，對國民黨加以鼓舞，加以鞭策，相信國民黨必能踔厲奮發，完成三民主義的新中國。因為國民黨有它的光明歷史，立于大地有根有基，而且今天繫國家的輕重，與人為善自可以為善。古人有云：「根之深者其葉茂，膏之沃者其光　」，所以我們推己及人，對國家和對國民黨，抱着無限的熱望，而國民黨三中全會宣言，其提示的五點：一日完成憲政準備，確立建國規模；二日消除統一障礙，鞏固國家基礎：三曰實行民生主義，穩定經濟基礎：四曰維護國際正義，致力國際和平；五曰充實敎育內容，培養建國元氣。我們讀此宣言後，認為國民黨具有責任戚，在訓政結束後，尙能以國以民為重，不遠嫌不規避，不畏葸不退縮，其忠悃自可燭照任何妖魔鬼怪。不過，至理明言順理成章，端在力行，端在實踐：國民黨是講能知能行的政黨，所以今後應在行的方面着力。朱熹曰：「論先後，知為先；論輕重，行為重」。這次三中全會宣言提示的五點，針對時弊，自有重量，但必須堅貞奮鬥，但必須「精誠團結，至公無私，不分昆域，不分黨派，愈困愈厲，奮勇向前，必能克服一切困難，突破一切障礙，竟國父之遺志，完成建國之全功」！</p>
<p>要之，國民黨於訓政結束後，還政於民，黨到民間，與其他黨派同為普通的政黨，黨與人民是二位一體，或者說是一體兩面，所以這次三中全會宣言提要的要點，三中全會通過的議案，它有人民的聲音，它有人民的要求。然要這股聲饗，歷百日而常新，不僅國民黨今後應把握它作為政策主張，堅貞奮鬥，，就是改組後的政府，亦應以之作為施政主張，則憲政實施有期，國家統一有望。至於還政於民以後，國民黨的地位，宣言亦提示今後「所處之地位，及其對於政府之關係，自不同於往時」，然國民黨的奮鬥精神，祇要持之以久，黨在民間以民為重，自能在民問站立起來；黨在政府與友黨推誠合作，自能有無限的朋友，所謂「雖貴必以賤為本，雖高必以下為基」，幷不斷改正缺點，明辨輕重，篤實踐履，今後的地位雖不同於往昔，然今後的活力必充沛於往昔。</p>
<p>三中全會已閉幕，三中全會在各方面，有它的收穫。此一次集會，為國民黨的轉捩點，更新的大道，要自己去創造，纔有坦途；如仍「決而不行」或行而脫軌，那是黨的前途不幸。國民黨現在僅憬着燦爛莊嚴底遠景，但這遠景尙可望而未及，如循坦途前行，需要人民作後盾，黨派作朋友。所以說，國民黨還政於民以後，必須要爭取人民，必須要爭取朋友，始可成就來日之燦爛莊嚴。國民黨結束訓政後，與其他黨派處同等地拉作政治競爭，必須要格外惕勵，必須同要格外奮勉，做幾件挽回風氣的事，辦幾件振奮人心的事，國民黨在今後政治上，始可成就來日之燦爛莊嚴。三中全會宣言，最後以「無負於國父與先烈，無奐於抗戰忠烈與戰後流離顚沛含辛茹苦之同胞」為己任，勗勉黨人，我們亦以此期勉國民黨！</p>

<h3>史達林延見貝文　談話內容當與修正盟約事有關　馬史不久亦將舉行會談</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿四日電〕貝文外相於今日下午七時，偕英駐蘇大使彼德森·私人秘書及譯員等，入克里姆林宮與史達林唔談。外界對於談話內容，揣測殊多，惟延長英蘇盟約一點，當然必曾談及。其他可能在兩人今日之會談或以後之會談中談及之問題，由史達林方面提出者，當不外（一）社魯門總統之「美國將以經濟干涉阻遏世界共產主義伸展」之宣言發表後，英國在英蘇關係中之政策將採何種定義。。英一最近所訂五十年盟約之重要意義。（三）因本屆德國問題之討諭而產生之任何問題。在貝文方而者當有：（一）闡明英國履行英蘇盟約之意向，並要求延長同盟友好條約至五十年。（二）在任何同盟强國之一，以參加內戰，可能的內戰，或鼓勵他國之對立份子作為其外交政策工具之情形下，盟國間是否可能成立國際諒解。（三）因本屆德國問題討論產生之任何問題。</p>

<h3>美援助希土款項　大部爲贈與性質　克萊頓在外委會秀露</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕參院外委會今日開會討論杜魯門總統所提援助希土一案，陸軍部長柏德遜，海軍部長福萊斯泰及代理國務鄉艾克遜等均出席陳述意見。柏氏促請國會從速援助希臘，以免共產黨領導之武裝部隊獲得控制權。福氏表示已有掃雷艇四艘售予土耳其，且希土二國要求訂購更多軍艦。柏德遜與艾克遜並保證總統方案中決不派遺美軍前往希土，但　助理國務卿古萊頓在衆院外交委員會透露，支持希土對抗共產主義之四億美元中半數以上將作為軍事方面用途。此項軍費完全贈給而非貸與該一國，餘款大部份恐亦將以同樣方式給與。又據艾氏官稱：預料內僅約五千萬美元將償還美國。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿四日電〕共和黨衆議員狄爾克森頃向衆議院宣稱：美國應與希土兩國進行談判，商訂一項恊定，由希土兩國將其海空基地長期租與美國使用，作為美國在金融上援助希土兩國之條件。此外，希土兩國在商業上亦應向美國有所讓步云</p>

<p>〔路總社羅盛頓廿四日個〕代理開務豳艾克遜今日告參院外委會開：希土兩國三民主政府如不獲支持，則希土與遼東中國間之廣大區域內均可能發生混亂，而中國，印度，緬甸，阿富汗，沙地阿拉伯，巴勒斯坦及伊拉克必定將受影響。艾克遜要求參院批准立法，以實行杜魯門總統之援助希土計劃，防止中東極權主義之擴張。渠謂印度正値艱難時期，國內秩序混亂，民主政府若吿破產，則局勢益發不可收拾。朝鮮南部亦需要美國資本之投資，俟陸海軍部及國務院確定意見後，將向國會提出援韓之方案。援助範圍，目前尙不能確定，但朝鮮在今後三年內，需要美國資本之援助，美政府迄猶不能使朝鮮完成統一，此皆蘇聯政府未能或不願討論統一問題之故。</p>

<p>美對共產黨已嚴加防範</p>
<p>美國軍人協會某發言人贊同反美活動委員會討論中之各項措施，即規定加入共產黨為違法，不准共產黨員在聯邦或各州競選，不准敎導共產主義或遞寄共產主義宣傳品。蒲立德深恐美國人尙未充分認識共產黨存在及蘇聯決心征服美國之危險性，故不信美國公衆將擁護上述之重罰，爰提出變通辦法，主張增撥聯邦偵緝局經費，以監視共產黨活動，俾於一旦緊急時，將此輩一網打盡，一如戰時對付德美協會會員之辦法。</p>

<h3>煤業公會列舉五項事實　呈控燃管會凟職　代表團晉京請願歸來談經過　中樞已派員來滬密查</h3>
<p>本市煤業公會，以經濟部上海區燃料管理委員會自三十五年十二月迄今，未奉部令擅自俾止配給民用煤斤，致使同業二九六家營業陷於停頓，除於二月五日急電主席兼院長蔣，請求「指撥煤源救濟煤商外，並推選代表團謝蘅牕，潘以三，鮑　薌，毛春圃，陸裕生，陳錦榮等於十八日晋京，分別向行政院’經濟部等機關請願。廿四日蔣主席特於三全會紀念週後，召見該業理事長謝蘅牕，面允轉飭經濟部改善煤斤管制辦法。經濟部王部長定廿九日來滬會商善後。</p>
<p>昨據甫自京中請願歸來之上海煤業公會理事長謝　牕稱：煤業公會請願代表抵京後，即晋謁行政院及經濟部。政院由樊際昌秘書代表接見，經部由王部長靈五親自接見，對煤業請願代表之意見表示接受，並囑補具上海燃料管理委員會自三十五年十二月起至三十六年三月中，徇情將配給煤斤轉售黑市之事實。代表等乃於本月二十日補呈燃管會徇悄配煤之事實五件，申請核辦。並悉中樞對此為重視，政院及經部巳分別派員抵滬密查中。</p>
<p>五項事實</p>
<p>煤業公會所列舉之燃管會徇私配給事實五起，計：（一）本市高陽路四七五弄二一號永大油廠，去年十二月及今年先後二次配得煤斤一百三十五噸。煤業公會據密報，得悉該廠係用柴油爲燃料。三月四日乃派員實地調查，見廠內存煤的二十噸，據該廠職員李松斷云：搬還前借十五噸，自用二十噸，其餘煤斤不能說明正當用途。並對調查人員「請求帮忙」。此中顯有徇私情弊。（二）勞勃生路十號昌興紗廠，本年十二月配得二五三噸，本年配得三百噸，兩共五五三噸，經派員查明該廠係用電力，並不賴煤斤為燃料。嗣據該廠人員稱：係印染部份所用。然查勞勃生路十號及十一號廠內，並無印染設備，此中顯有枸私情弊。（三）輸船機器木業之三和興·恊興昌·鴻興昌三家，本年共配得煤十八噸，經分別調查，三和興今年未開工，協興昌未有燒煤之爐灶設備，鴻新昌並無其廠名，該廠址乃係餘大木行。（四）中正西路五七弄三號，未經申請，竟有配給煤。（五）馬當路八三〇號恒豐印染廠，表年底配煤一五五噸，今年配煤二百十噸。查該廠有爐灶四隻，計二隻用柴油，一隻用花餅，僅一隻燃煤。用煤至多佔配給額四分之一，顯屬徇私浮配云。</p>

<h3>海閩輪今午可到　沉艦案秉公處理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕在廈鬥外龜嶼海面與伏波艦互撞之招商局海閩輪，今午已可抵滬·預定停泊董家渡浦面八·九號浮筒·據悉該輸船頭左舷受傷甚重，返滬後須加條理。</p>
<p>前駛加爾各答之海天輪，已於上星期五離印返滬。駛關島之海地輸。亦已於上星期六，由關島起程返滬，兩輸均有大批剩餘物資運來。</p>
<p>〔另訊〕據招商局負實人談：按照國際航海避碰章程，向有明晰規定，若甲乙兩船在夜間相遇時，乙船顯示右舷緣燈於甲，而甲船顯示左舷紅燈於乙，則乙船應負避讓甲船之實，即乙船看見甲船紅燈時，應將船首偏右顯示紅燈。反之甲船看見乙船顯示右舷綠燈時，則甲船保持原來船向，如是則甲乙兩船紅燈互照，平行相遇，斷無碰撞之虞。此次海問與伏波號在夜間相遇，海閩顯示左舷紅燈，伏波顯示右舷綠燈，則伏波應有避讓責任，海閩應係持原向費任。如伏波艦將船首偏右，顯示紅燈於海閩，則紅燈與紅燈互照，平行相過，如此當不致造成大禍。至此一不奉事件之者任問題，待海閩輸抵滬後，海軍司令部。交通部以及航海專家多人所組織之碰　公聯委員會，自當秉公處理。</p>

<h3>商務薪金折扣起點　勞資猶待繼續商討</h3>

<h3>中航公司外籍專家　談改善民航現狀　避免飛行失事　端在特別謹愼　疲憊心理必須矯正</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司外籍專家龐特（Bond）上月底自美來華，負責指導改善民航現狀。　特為中航公司開業元勳之一，服務已達十六年，渠於一九三一年來華，初任職於汎美公司，翌年汎美公司與我國政府合辦中航公司，龐特即調任機航組主任。近年來退休任高級顧問。去年九月因身體欠佳，請假六月，返美休養，茲因民航廣吿失事，故提前返華設法改善。同來尙有新任機航主任愛理遜（Ellison），亦為中航公司開創時期之機師。</p>
<p>記者昨日走訪兩氏，詢以究將如何進行，龐特認為過表歷次飛機失事，由於設備不良者尙在其决，最主要者實因大意疏忽之故，渠認為經過第二次大戰以後，世界各地人類普遍均有疲憊之心理，觀於近來全球到處均有飛機失事，或即由於此種心理所引起之鬆懈不安現象所造成。世界航空事業尙在幼年時期，中國尤屬初創，決不可稍遇挫折而即停止。當然對於今後飛機失事必須力予遏止，在目前設備方面，旣由於種種客觀因素，一時未能即予改善，唯一之方法，亦為有效之方法，即為特別謹愼，所謂特別謹愼，包括機件檢查之縝密，地面工作人員之盡責，惡劣氣候之避免，機師駕駛之護愼等等。準此以往，相信飛行失事必可滅至最少限度。渠並以小兒學步作譬，顯躜跌仆在所不免，但終能日漸壮大也。</p>

<h3>靜安寺兩僧人附逆案　德司密迦昨審結　否認一切罪嫌辯與同朋學校無關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕靜安寺主持德悟及監院密　漢奸嫌疑案，昨晨在高院審理終結，定四月一日上午宣判。德悟，廿八歲，上海人。密迦，三十七歲，寗波人。經靜安寺前主持六根，前監督仰西，曁謝錫卿等檢舉。被吿之罪行為與日本東本願寺合辦同朋日語學校，參加偽佛教會並任常務理事。舉行金剛普利法會，大東亞慰靈法會，靜安寺護法會，歡迎日人友松法師及倉持法師。昨日開審時，旁聽席上坐滿和尙，對此量後一鞠均極為關心。審訊時間自九時至十二時達三小時之久。被吿辯稱：偽上海特別市佛敎會，係上海各寺院所組織之宗敎團體，凡本市各大寺院主持或首職，皆為當然理事或常務理事，其宗旨對外爲提倡慈善救濟事業，對內則發掃佛敎，整飭敎規，絕無政治上經濟上或軍事上之意義。同朋日語學校係日方强借靜安小學敎室兩間，在夜間上課，其校主為東本願寺儈木下萬溪，校中人事及經費各項，槪與靜安寺毫不相關。告訴人所提出之「佛敎同朋日語學校」之招生度吿及校名木牌攝影二紙，均係吿訴人所偽造。金剛普利法會係西藏喇嘛　班禪代表榮　　師借靜安寺舉行。靜安寺護法會會長為李思浩，其宗旨純為發揚佛旨，整飭敎規，維護寺產，舉辦公益事業，為佛敎信徒維獲佛敎之組織，絕無其他作用。大東亞慰靈會係大東亞佛敎會主辦，在玉佛寺舉行。歡迎日人友松法師及倉持法師來華，係為偽上海特別市佛敎會所迫，不過應酬性質，此外並未與友松，倉持發生任何關係。被吿供畢，即由檢察官孫向榮起立請庭上依法辦理。嗣經辯護律師宓錫通，周孝庵，奚士昌起立辯訴後，　庭長論，本案辯論終結，定四月一日宣判。</p>
<h3>共同伯惠突遭狙擊案　凶手何人成疑問　地檢處認爲鄭德昇等罪證不足</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前時報館主人黃伯惠被「狙擊」一案，據黃自述，本年二月十八日下午十時許，由外返抵湖北路一七九號福湖大樓寓所，見大門洞開，彼乃循梯登樓，至二樓扶梯邊，忽見二婦女，向其探望後，忽怱折返三樓，同時三樓總門突出現頭戴便帽身御黃色大衣之西人二名，直趨三樓四樓扶梯轉角處，上前攔阻，不令前進，當加質詢，該二西人即謂：「此即吾等所需之人」。其一即恃强挾持彼之兩臂，其靠右邊之另一西人，即出手槍向彼頭頂顫門部位射擊，當痛極仆地，但神志尙淸，覺一西人復以脚挾持其頭頸，使不能稍動，因懼其再擊，乃急呼稱：「余乃羅斯福總統之友」，二西人聞言始釋去。待兇手去遠，乃掙扎登四樓四一一室，由友人送仁濟醫院求治。並謂，其房產經租人鄭德昇，因房屋糾紛，及其他債權債務，挾嫌唆使其美國朋友盍司韋脫殺人，其妻鄭溥氏，女鄭瀞艷，亦帮同謀害。現該案經地檢處曹鴻檢察官一月餘之縝密偵查，結果認為被吿鄭德昇，鄒溥氏，鄭瀞艷，盍司韋脫等四人罪證不足，應予不起訴處分。曹檢察官在不起訢書中分三部份說明：（一）關於鄭德昇，鄭溥氏，鄭瀞艷部份，雖查得黃伯惠與鄭德昇因房量糾紛及其他債權債務關係馴生嫌隙，然雙方已委託律師進行調解，且民事債權債務關係，鄭德昇何出此下策，自蹈法網。至盍司韋脫雖與鄭德昇相稔，但非深交，豈竟能畀以殺人重任，在盍司　脫而言，交非刎頸，刑處大辟，人孰無智，何至冒此大不韙，以自甘刑繫。（二）盍司韋脫部份，蓋係行總水運大隊萬儉輪二副，與鄭於旅途邂逅相識，初非深交，與黃伯惠更素時平生，亳無恩怨，且經同船職員證明，該日晚上盍未離輸。（三）履勘出事地點結果，不特未見强壳，而四壁及手槍射程及射擊角度範圍內無强痕可尋，而出事之三樓四樓轉角壁間，血液濺點，其尖端均屬向上，可證屬血液滴至地面濺起或地面積血受壓力四濺所致，若謂站立之際頭頂受傷血液四濺，則其濺點必尖端向下，且查黃之頭頂創傷係作弧形，更非槍傷所致之明證，同時福湖大樓三四樓各住衣均謂未聞槍聲。故黃伯惠所告訴被吿鄭德昇等四人，應依刑事訴訟法二百三十一條第十款不起訴處分。至本案在押之被吿鄭德昇，在處分未確定前，將仍不予開釋。</p>
<h3>細故發生齟齬　鐵匠毆死髮妻</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬西西康路九七二弄四九五號住衣常州人尹畫坤，卅四歲，業白鐵匠。其妻馬氏，廿七歲，結婚已十年，生一女，十歲。平日夫婦情感尙佳，昨晨七時許，書坤起身後，擬往閘北工作，急命馬氏速煮早炊，因氏稍有怨言，兩人發生齟齬，繼尹即將馬氏毆打。馬氏跌仆於地，昏厥不起，尹即離家外出。嗣氏之表弟巢洪生（住同弄）聞訊奔來，亟雇車伴送其一表姊至市立第三醫院救治，但抵院已氣絕身死。經人報吿普陀路警局，由股長朱定坤飭股員張筱林，警員趙永吉等馳往醫院及寓所調查眞相，幷留便警數名，在其家守候。至九時許，馬尙未知馬氏已被毆斃，匆匆返家，當被留守之警員拘獲帶局偵訊，直認毆擊不諱。定今晨申解司法機關審辦。</p>
<h3>小皮匠之妻　居然戴鑽戒　牯嶺路行竊敗露　全部人犯均落綱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕牯嶺路一五二號，住有王鐘祺者，業證券，十七日黎明四時左右，忽聞扶梯上有脚步聲，即暍問何人？當有人答是我，知事不妙，急起床下樓探視，發覺前後門洞開，房內五斗橱開啓，吊在衣架上大衣袋內之鑰匙，亦不翼而飛，急追出弄外找尋，但已無蹤。乃開具失單，計鑽戒二只一重逾三克拉十分，一計一克拉六十分，金錫五只，金戒三只，珠賓戒紅寳戒各一只，金元寶一只，小金條三根，翡翠紅寶石耳環一副，金手錶及掛錶各一，　幣千餘枚，其餘銀筷，銀器殊夥。</p>
<p>經該管警分局股長丁振鐸，飭股員翁永泉，警長顧卓斌，幹警方繩武等馳往查勘，初無所獲，後忽在北京西路一六一弄內，發現垃圾桶側有王家五斗樹空抽屜一只，始悉竊犯必居此弄。經偵查結果，獲悉弄口擺設皮匠攤之小皮匠名周俟傑，涉有嫌疑，同時發覺其妻趙氏戴有鑽戒一枚，於是斷定行竊無疑。又偵悉同路一六九號協興印刷所工友顧阿大與周往來頗密，最近亦有金戒等鉓物出售，乃先將顧阿大及周趙等一併帶局偵訊，均矢口否認。嗣風聞趙氏曾持三克拉鑽戒至北京西路長壽里五號王余氏處兜售，買價祇三百萬元，王氏因其價格過低，不敢收受。遂傳王氏到局詢問，答稱確有其事，即令與周氏對質，始俯首無語，承認一切。並供出鑽戒等飾物由伊夫周俊傑偕彭震麟，顧阿大等置在一抽屜內，由外携歸，惟不詳其自何處竊來。斯時周亦承認不諱，遂由警員帶至其家，在地板下擱樓上抄出一部份原贓後，至山東路永樂里二〇四號彭震麟家，搜捕未獲，直至昨晨九時許，彭親投該分局自首，全體人犯，擬不日申解地檢處究辦。</p>
<h3>九曲橋畔賊窠　起出贜物纍纍　湖北幫　首領落綱</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕邑　警分局會於本月廿三日一日之間，破獲大小竊案三起，盜案一起，　毒及吸毒案各一起。除販賣及吸毒人犯　冬根，楊王氏等已送地檢處外，其餘各案至昨晚始吿偵查完學，起獲之贓物逾一萬萬元。內中拘獲之竊犯有蘭名於費浦，蓬美，邑廟三區之湖北帮，其重要份子强玉山·陳林根·朱納安·吳少南·周壽生·黃光學等六名巳悉數落綱。</p>
<p>緣邑廟譽分局長沈搪亨廿三日接密報，謂有大批著名竊犯匿居城隍廟九曲橋畔棚戶內，乃於是日淸晨，派股長周南率領幹員　根深，孫自强等馳往搜查，結果在棚戶中抄出紅糖六包（約一千三百餘斤），額料四桶三箱，縫衣車頭三只，布十七疋，總計約値一億餘元之鉅。當將有關人犯一併帶局，經個別偵訊後，發覺著名之湖北帮首領張玉林等六名亦在其內。復經二日夜之偵查，得悉上項物資係自丹鳳路西宜坊一號，方浜路四〇六號，中正東路一三九號，積善寺街四五弄二號，瞿家弄進賢小學校等處竊來。該犯等將於今日移送地檢處。此外又在墩基弄福康里及裏馬路一五八號拘獲正在行竊之小愉朱店發，趙阿通·顧志忠·胡才全等四名，當塲截獲皮箱二只，洋傘十八頂，面盆廿三只，鋼精鍋四只，縫衣機一具。至破獲盜案一起，係屬廿三日晚九時半搶刦雲居街廿五號元和烟紙店之匪犯名顧紹富，現因尙有問黨在逃，故已聲請延長羈押時間，傳便偵查云。</p>

<h3>美軍前駐台聯絡組人員　侵佔黃金案　不起訴處分　收購贜物十八人亦因大赦不起訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美軍前駐台聯絡組負責人艾文思中校，侵占台灣日軍應移交我國政府之黃金六十公斤，夜上海出賣圖利一案，前由司法行政部令本市地檢處偵查，茲經劉用之檢察官偵查終結，以管轄錯談，予以不起訴處分。據案卷中載稱：該項黃金，係前日本陸軍省運菲列賓補給日軍者，因當時航空困難，途經台灣降落後，無法前運，故由駐台日軍保管，艾文思中校查悉該批黃金後，即先後分五次向日本官兵善後連絡部參謀原田佐少佐提取，僅於三十四年十一月一日第二次所取得之黃金六十公斤，分藏四木箱，偕原田佐遝往我合灣行政長官公署，由秘書長葛敬恩接收。後由台灣警備司令部軍法處向原田佐查詢，據稱，除第二次直接解交公署外，餘第一·三·四·五决，均由艾文思親駕吉普車來取去，並當塲打開本箱，將金塊藏入紅色手提皮包中運去。</p>
<p>駐華美軍總部</p>
<p>曾於卅五年五月派員赴台調查該案，同年六月，在滬拘獲艾文思將該批黃金委託出售之經手人台商黃在義，據黃供稱，艾文思於卅四年十一月十二月先後二次來滬，託其出售金塊一千九百二十一塊（每塊一兩），共中三百餘槐，由愛陸生上尉售去，共得美金十萬另八千元，黃在義得介紹費美金八百五十元。駐華美軍總部刑事調查組，根據黃在義之供詞，向本市大森。協泰等十四家錢莊，行號查獲原贓黃金一千九百二十一塊，該項金塊正面鑄有「福」字，背面有24K/1000與合署新接收者完全相同，故侵占</p>
<p>罪行似可確定</p>
<p>惟愛隆生上尉係美國現役軍人，依法應由美軍事法庭審判，艾文思中校現已退役，但無中國軍人及我政府之公務員身份，故不能以懲治貪汚條例處罪，僅能構成普通刑法第三百卅六條第一項之公務侵占罪，但其犯罪時問在卅五年十二月卅一日以前，最高本刑不過付期徒刑七年，符合大赦令甲項赦免規定，且艾文思，愛隆生二人遠處美國；耳前中美二國</p>
<p>尙無引渡條約</p>
<p>故仍以移歸美國政府自行依法密判為當。至其民事上賠償責任，將來可依民訴程序以求合理解決，爰依刑事訴訟法第二百卅一條第七款第三款予以不起訴處分。至收購贓物部份，被吿黃在議，孫　先·蔣聲堂·決總餘·程菊時·李志誠·楊智昌·徐鶴年·王守正·　階鶴·王克文·陳雲熙·朱錦春·胡玉技·朱家麟·股煜洪·莊善炳·施祥隆等十八人，亦因大赦，處分丕起訴。</p>

<h3>統債黑市雖遭遇壓力　市價仍向高峯掙扎　外股走勢昨亦異常俏利</h3>

<h3>市塲神經過敏　華股起落無常</h3>
<p>華股昨晨俏後疲，多方有一部份續在加碼，午前有軋空趨勢。及夜報有蔣主席赴美之訊，人心頓起反動，急切回瀉，反以疲熊結束。</p>
<p>開晨</p>
<p>仍昂，開後永紗遞交由二二六號一四三號四七號二二四號一八三號二三五號八五號俱進，現遞美亞及中絲首吿漲停，永紗亦升至二六四〇元。六一號八九號一五六號九一號二二號一七七號一六九號七一號一五四號均售，回降至二五七〇元，一七七號二三一號二三五號一八六號俱進，一一七號一四號一〇六號八號則賣，大事盤旋。進至十一時，始由一五二號二號八九號一八五號一四三號一一七號九七號一五號二三五號均進，商務國貨水泥漲到限度，永紗乃升至二六八〇元。一八〇號一七九號一四九號一〇六號一三七號均有脫手，退至二六三〇元，現永紗此時曾高至遞交之上，人心尙挺。景綸新亞亦吿漲停，七八號三二號三五號九七號俱購而再漲到二六九〇元而後稍盤。結果較前收計永紗華豐新光景福各升半成强，信和美亞中法新華各漲一成，動興雖升而不多。遞交永紗華豐新光景福各升半成强，美亞漲一成，冷股中紡中絲商務國貨景綸水泥漲停，麗安新亞內衣中法漲停後有回，餘均升半成迄一成不等。</p>

<h3>飾金進出價如何決定　銀樓業向社會局請示　今日開會指定計算表　經社局決定後即後業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市銀樓業代表姚蓮芳，姚袿卿，吳彭年，陳德彰，表云良等，於昨日上午十一時許，携書面呈文，赴市府訪謁吳市長。吳市長當以所提各點，係屬市社會局主管，囑赴該局請示。各代表等當又於下午三時，前往市社會局。適吳局長因公赴京，由該局第二科邵科長接見。各代表提出書面呈文，要點有四：（一）售出價格，由公會議定，呈報社曾局備案，以資簡捷。（二）倘遇供求不能相應時，顧客不得强購强兌，銀樓業隨時得呈請維護，以免糾紛。（三）收兌依據央行四十八萬牌價，如遇供求不平衡時，其飾金完好者，得酌量貼給顧主之工耗，以减輕顧主之損失，而維本業一貫之信用。（四）在央行未有配售前，僅恃門市收售，決難平衡，為酌盈濟虛計，同業間得互相供求，略加手續費，以免產生黑市。社局邵科長當表示：財部公布新管理辦法，迄亦僅見報載，社局尙未接到正式訓令。對各代表所提要求，當代為轉呈吳局長，請示辦法。</p>
<p>又據各代表談稱：該榮將於今日召開會議，決定出售飾金價格計算表。該表包個項膩，每兩除按央行四十八萬元牌價外，再加利潤，利息，工耗等費的十萬元。該表決定後，即將於今日送呈社局。如一獲確切覆示，即將復業。又平，津，蘇，浙，粵鄂等地同集代表，亦在滬候訊，將與滬市同集採取同一步驟云。</p>
<h3>原料問題如不能解決　火柴工業前途黯澹</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據工商輔導處調查：本市火柴工業同業公會會員共二十四家，（內三星火柴廠因營業不振已退會），現本市火柴廠總產量，每月約一萬三千箱（大中華上海熒昌廠在內，分廠不在內，美光在內）。若發揮全能力，則可達一萬九千箱。現一般工廠之產量，祗及全能力五分之三。廿四家工廠共有工人二七六二人，排板車共一三六架。據調查：火柴製造成本，大小廠均相彷彿。而售價相差甚鉅。大廠每箱一五〇萬元，而小廠則的五〇萬元。故宜聯合經營，藉以保護小廠之生存。火柴原料如氣酸鉀，氧化鋅，國產品不敷應用，大量仰給於外貨。牛皮膠本市有熾昌新膠廠可以大部供給。棉楊木一部來自靑島，但大部仍仰賴舶來品。其他如赤磷，白臘，紅礬，硫黃華等，均須仰舶來品。故本市火柴工業，對原料問題，如不解決，實無重大意義可言。經營火柴者，對於氣酸鉀，赤磷，及棉楊木之供應，亟宜先行設法自製，確立吾國火柴工業之基礎。目下只有放寬外匯之供給，藉以維持現狀。又該處認為刻下本市冒牌火柴，至為猖獗。此等貨品粗劣濫做，有碍正當廠家之營業。該業希望政府加以禁止。又該業以火柴為日用必需品，課稅百分之二十，似嫌太高，擬請政府設法减低，以利營業。</p>
<h3>不得收兌黃金條塊　京銀樓業請從寬辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日專電〕南京銀樓業同業公會理事長嚴春榮稱二該業同人原定今日一律復業，但於昨日下午召開復業座談會時，因一部份會員認為財政部公佈之銀樓業收兌及製造金飾管理辦法第五條規定，銀樓業不得收兌黃金條塊一節，無異進一步斷絕原金供給，須請求主管機關解釋，並請求從寬辦理，故今日上午除南京中華路老天竇等數家，已開始營業外，餘均繼續停業。今晨十一時，該業曾派代表嚴春榮等四人，往社會局請願，要求對銀樓業不得收兌黃金一點，予以放寬尺度，因該局無變更政府法令之權，乃允將該業困難，代為轉達政府當局。</p>
<h3>輸廣小組分別開會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出推廣會紡織品針織品及棉花小組會，於昨日下午二時，在紡建公司召開第一次會議。出席楊錫仁，吳味經，郭棣活，王仰先，張似旅等。討論意見多起：（一）目前央行英匯牌價，買賣相差八千元。對輸往英鎊集團之棉紡品，吃虧殊大。擬請將英匯買賣差價輻度，最高不使超過百分之五。（二）我國棉紗外銷事宜，仰光，西貢，暹羅等地，近正接洽推進中。香港方面，第二批棉紗因需要卅二支及四十二支細紗，故將需延至下月初，方能輸出。（三）現本市棉紗市價平衡，故本市棉紗外銷量，每月大致將擴佔至總生產量十分之一。</p>
<p>又草帽鞭及草帽小組會，亦於昨日下午三時，在中信局召開第一次會議。到沈熙瑞，馮積明，俞朗西，林錦福，孫德佑，袁家麟等。討論意見：（一）對草帽鞭原料之進口，望海關能給予便利，將來出口時，可從征取出口稅方面，予政府以貼補。（二）對該業貸款資金，望能直接貸予生產商。</p>
<p>又最近各小組會歷决開會討論意見，均將彙案提交本週四召開之輸出推廣會執委會中討論，俾作最後之決定。</p>
<h3>紗價轉趨平穩</h3>
<p>昨日紗市又轉平穩，綠贛客略有需求，業中人以成本增高，心思堅定，雖津粵帮觀望不動，仍有逢低吸進者，故價較前日上揚三四萬元之譜。</p>
<h3>茶市徘徊疲途</h3>
<p>還來洋莊茶市，趨勢始終徘徊疲途，良以自一般貨主鑒於本年度新茶即將生產，而對於　貨亟思脫手以來，市上現貨遂多。買戶雖趁低有吸，然過程終不脫供多於求也。價格方面殊難抬頭，昨日市上卅四年份　源抽珍，由同孚洋行吸進百餘箱，價每担一度低見五十五萬元。他若珍眉，針屆·等花色，大德昌·午昌·等茶葉公司各有扒取，脚地俱搖搖欲墜。至於專供內銷之紅綠茶，亦在去化復末下，情况寗靜非常。</p>

<h3>中國海軍搖籃　馬尼巡禮</h3>
<p>— 十八日福州航訊　本報特派記者陳正予</p>
<p>為尾——中國海軍的策源地，牠與一部中國海軍史有不可分之關係。遠溯同治五年，當時淸廷因攝於洋人船堅砲利之威而辦洋務，關浙總督左宗棠議與船政，並主就福州罵尾設造船廠。淸廷准可，翌年，命江西巡撫沈葆楨來閩照議規劃一切，寫下了中國海軍史第一章。中國是具有九千餘浬海岸綫的國家，立國需要海軍。提起中國海軍，令人不禁聯想到這蜷伏在閩江口北岸的罵尾，雖薑爾小鎭，却有牠的輝煌歷史。</p>
<p>閩海門戶　形勝之區</p>
<p>罵尾，位於福州東南廿五公里處，一端突出閩江中，為福州之門戶。港外山岳環繞，天然屏障；港內水深波靜，輪船停泊便利，而羅星塔元立中流，允扼形勝。凡開往福州之海輸，均寄椗於此，再用小輪送往市區，實省垣之外港。</p>
<p>如就軍事觀點而言：罵尾以下，兩山夾峙，江流容隘，閩安門拱衛於前，為天然屏藩。據此一隅，足以固守省垣及閩東各地，實海彊之雄區也。且馬港水深土實，港灣繚曲，適以訓練海軍。中國海軍之所以發靭於罵尾者，實有其地理之基礎，</p>
<p>練兵造船　盛極一時</p>
<p>馬尾本來是一個荒涼的鄉村，後來，因為跟着中國海軍的發展而趨於繁榮。房屋櫛比，人口稠密，儼如一小都市。溯自淸同治五年而至民國廿六年，此的八十年之時間，馬尾殆已成為海軍活動之樞紐。自沈葆楨氏總理船政以還，馬尾設立了造船廠及海軍前後學堂，前學堂專習航海技術，後學堂專習輪機，海軍耆宿薩鎭冰及楊樹莊等人都是出身於此，為中國海軍初期建設孕育了不少人才。民國肇造，前後學堂改為海軍學校，另設飛潛學校，藝術學院，飛機製造廠，藥彈廠，練營等。防務機構則有恪靖威營，巡防營，水師營，要港司令部，砲台陸戰隊，閩口江防司令部先後駐焉。造船廠最多時設有十三廠，容納員工達四千五百餘人，規模宏敝，設備週全，可製小型兵艦，砲船，運輸船而至各式砲彈，各部分建築巍峨雄偉，鱗次櫛比，蔚如海軍要區，曾經盛極一時，</p>
<p>海軍練營　碩果僅存</p>
<p>馬尾經過砲火洗禮後，呈現一片荒凉景象。海軍造船廠已停辦，江防機構亦巳分別撤裁，僅駐有海軍總司令部保管組人員保管此不易移動之一部分殘餘設備及藥彈，海軍學校早於抗戰初期西遷貴陽，今已移滬改為中央海軍軍官學校。而碩果僅存者惟海軍第二練營之駐紥，練營原為淸季練勇學堂所改稱，民國十五年由旅順口移設馬尾。創辦迄今，巳有五十餘載，為海軍造就不少幹部人才，今日海軍界官佐大半是出於馬尾海校與練營，福州淪陷時，該營內撤三元縣之梅列，去年遷回馬尾修葺營舍，並奉令擴充，同年九月海軍總司令部增設第一三兩練營分置於江陰與上海復興島，在馬尾者改稱第二練營。</p>
<p>招訓青年　保衛海疆</p>
<p>記者到達海軍第二練營，營長葉可鈺上校出而招待並引導參觀，該營營舍廣表五十餘畝，地區克敞，依山臨水，形勢雄處，益以遍地蒔花樹木，蒼翠芬郁，怡爽心情。梅國兵舍，高據山巔，俯瞰淸流，河山如畫。現有練兵千餘人，官佐一百三十餘人，練兵乃招考沿海各省及閩江上下遊各縣小學畢業而至初中畢業程度之子弟，歷屆投考者皆甚踴躍，足見沿海各地子弟立志於海彊之上。惟體格檢騐綦嚴，其標準以身高一百六十公分，體軍四十八公斤，胸圍七十五公分，呼吸差七公分，視力合萬國目力表左右眼在一·五以上，血壓最高一百四十，脈搏八十五，運動後五分鐘即能恢復常態者。凡色盲，砂眼，耳炎，聽覺不靈，花柳，痔漏及皮　病皆在淘汰之列。因此，練兵一般的體格標準相當高，足稱健兒而無愧。他們之訓練，分航海與輪機二大部門，設駕駛·輪機·槍砲·帆纜·水魚雷·電信·信號·軍樂等各班，課程很繁重，設有實習工塲於羅星塔，惟機械儀器較為缺少。訓練時期茲應國防之需要，縮短為六個月與九個月兩種，視課程之繁簡而定，聞該營前後已舉榮一百二十餘隊，數達萬餘人，有的分派各艦艇服務，有的分發靑島海訓團繼續訓練，有的遺送國外深造。</p>
<p>痛定思痛　重建海軍</p>
<p>記者參觀練營後，復與　營長暢談海軍建設馬尾前途諸問題。海軍是近代科學發展到最高峯的產物，容牠納了氣象·數學·物理·化學·力學·光學等科學原理，內容殊為繁複。建設海軍至為不易，貴有精密組織之精神與嚴謹之治軍方法。我國此次抗戰，當　洞開，商人長驅直入，是吃了沒有海軍的虧。一九四一年英國之不亡於德國，是食賜於海軍力量之强大，可資殷鑒。痛定思痛，只有埋頭重建海軍，以固海疆。葉氏與記者侃侃而談，似表熱望於未來海軍之建設。氏幼習海軍，畢業於烟台海校，十九年中央派赴日本專習海軍，歷任靖安。應瑞等艦艦長，抗戰初起，氏統率馬當砲隊，防守要塞，之後，奉命在浙贛內江佈雷，阻禦敵人深入，卓着功勳。氏體格魁梧，聲帶洪亮，長辭令，和靄可親，洽軍嚴明，頗為僚屬所擁戴。至於馬尾今後問題，氏表示造船廠規模宿具廠基現皆完整，將來如能就現有黨礎上鳩工興葺，修整殘存機件，不難恢復舊觀，從事修造船艦，亦屬建立海軍之要圖。記者歸後，翻閱</p>
<p>總理實業計劃中擬以福州建為二等良港，整治馬尾以下之閩江口水道，使達三十英尺以上深度，以便巨輸可以進泊，在新中國建設進程上馬尾不乏其重要性。</p>

<h3>我做了鄉民代表</h3>
<p>— 譚正璧</p>
<p>在這實行憲政的呼聲高漲之際，我也當起鄉民代表來了。經過了種種接觸後，却發生了許多感想。因為這是感想，所以寫出來在這裏發表。</p>
<p>鄉民代表是一鄉的民意機構，在一縣裏等於縣參議員，一省一市裏等於省市參議員。所以鄉民代表會是民煮機構的最下層組織，却是最最能够直接代表民意的。但說來可憐，一般鄉民代表當選的時候，都不知道這是一種什麼玩意兒，都以為不過用來代表鄉民選舉縣參議員，巷人抬抬轎子罷了，所以大家都有些討厭担任這個名義。我想：這不單是我們這裏一鄉是這樣，恐怕全國倒有百分之九十九的鄉鎮是這樣吧！而且，說也可憐，不要說一般的代表，都曾身歷訓政時期而都還不能明瞭自己所負的責任是些什麼，就是我這個在大學畢過業得稱文學士，而又當過大學講師的人，平時也留心一切法令，起初也委實不曾十分明瞭鄉民代表到底是個什麽玩意兒。還是在當選之後，拿有關的法令來研究了一下才恍然大悟的。</p>
<p>因此我想：假使一鄉的鄉民代表選出了，鄉民代表會成立了。而這些代表們都不知自己應該做的是什麼，而一味聽受鄉行政磯關的指揮，鄉行政機關要呌你通過什麼議案，你就通過什麽議案。這麽一來，本來有許多事情是由鄉行政機關負責任的，現在牠可以把責任推到你身上來了。你不但不能代表民意，有負鄉民的推選，反而代鄉行政機關槍起木梢來了。自己做了傀儡，受了利用還沒知道，這是實行憲政時期一件非常危險的事情。</p>
<p>還有一種情形，當了代表的，雖至不知自己應該做些什麼事情，可是有些略懂皮毛的，又以為鄉民代表會是一鄉的最高權力機關，鄉民代表是一鄉的特殊人物，有着特殊權力，便假用代表的名義和力量，在當地武斷鄉曲，魚肉鄉民，承襲那過去土豪劣紳的行為。這不是我的杞人憂天，實在己經聽到過，在縣參議員中有過這樣人物，所以不敢說在鄉民代表中一定沒有。這種情形和前述情形是一樣的不利於憲政的推行，這都是一看就明白的。</p>
<p>所以我有一種愚見，以為：鄉民代表不比縣省市參議員，因為他們的知識程度只要有國民學校畢業的程度就可以，所以在當選之後，當由上級機關加以訓練，至少須用方法使得他們明白自已處於怎樣一種地位，應該做些什麽事情，和鄉行政機關的關係如何，然後可以敎他們行使職權，成為眞正的民意的機構，而促成憲政的實現。</p>
<p>這次我當了鄉民代表去參加第一次代表會議時，承大家推我做主席，我就不客氣立即對各位代表申述兩點：（一）不要因爲是個起碼的鄉民代表，不像縣市參議負的顯赫而以為不屑做，因為這倒是民意機構的最最下層組織，是最直接的民意機構，是代表民意最直接的代表。（二）在們是代表全鄉民眾的意見，並且監督鄉行政機關的，和鄉行政機關處於對立地位，所以不能監督鄉行政機關，或鄉行政機關有了錯誤而不去糾正，和不行使一切法律上所規定的我們應該做的職權，那就是失職而對不起全鄉民眾的付託。接着我又把法律上所規定的我們應該行使的職機大略說了一些</p>
<p>誰知經我這樣一講，本來大家對於這個職務和這個會議毫沒有興趣的人，忽而都興奮起來，使這個會不寂寞地開下去。而且是散會後還大家在閒談，對於我所說的我們能够行使的職權一項，還嫌說得不十分淸楚詳盡，最好能够再詳講一下，大家可以照着這個範圍去做。而且他們又有一種意見，因為多數代表多來自鄉村，平時對於擅作威福的鄉行政人員從來不肯也不敢得罪，我以我雖然也曾對他們說明：我們在會中所說的話，對外可以不負責任，但他們還是投鼠忌器，不敢多多發言。而最大的原因，卻是當開會時，鄉行政人員因被邀列席報告和聽受質詢而也在席上，因此影響着當了他們的面有許多話不好意思說出來。這樣一來，彈劾料正的案子便難於提出了。</p>
<p>現在這個會還在開下去，但除了上述的種種情形外，我想說不定還有其他意料不到的事情會發現呢。我現在雖然為了生活而忙於寫作，但却很高興撥出一些功夫來和大家做好這一件事情。因為道不是什麽名利的事，而是一種國民應盡的責任。這是一個比較有智識的人所不屑做的事，但我倒是以為這是每個智識分子如果有着這種機會時都應該做的。因為這才能眞正和民眾接近，而知道眞正的民間疾苦呀！</p>
<p>因為是感想文章，所以寫來很雜亂的，請原諒！</p>
<h3>仰望</h3>
<p>— 夢農</p>
<p>友人正握住了一支畫筆，在書布架前，像在思索着什麼。</p>
<p>凑近過去，走到了他所站立着的高墩上。細細一看，畫布上，什麽都完成了！近景，是茸茸的草坪，是蜿蜓的湖岸，是吹皺了的湖水，是幾乎垂到岸邊的柳絲。中景，是從柳絲萬條中透露出來的滿臉呈現着風塵色彩的穿着棗紅綫衫的流浪靑年，在小湖的彼岸寂寂地枯坐着，昂着無力的頭，似乎不動也不響。後背的遠景，是全面的蒼空。</p>
<p>整個的畫面，充滿了新綠，嫩黃，紺碧，棗紅，淺灰，筆觸顯得柔和而生動，色彩也極其鮮明而富於活力。</p>
<p>「朋友，快完成了吧？」我打斷了他的思索。</p>
<p>「完成？沒這樣容易哩！你想：最難完成的部分，同時是最重要的部分，還沒有完成哩！」</p>
<p>「這是什麼意思？」我疑惑着，顯得我對於他的構圖和意匠的無理解。</p>
<p>「我還沒有表現我這幅畫的生命的核心呢，我所要表現的是那流浪靑年的煩悶心境，你瞧，他可不是正在凝神仰望—雲—雲十不可思議的雲嗎？」</p>
<p>「哦，絲絲的垂柳，不是已經表現了那流浪靑年心中所隔離了的世界了嗎？你知道『惟雲不能聲』的眞理嗎？雲，正如你所愛說的話，原是不可思議的呵！雲、，有時，巍峨如高山一樣，有如鳳鳥急飛，有時，奔騰如天馬行空。它的生命，不斷的變幻，無窮的改觀，你正要捕捉它，它却消逝於無形，你以為正好畫成它了，却不料它早已不是它，因為它的本身是流散了！」</p>
<p>「哦！」他放下了畫筆，重又陷入了沉思。「那麼，就讓這靑年永遠抬着他的頭，仰望一些什麽罷！」</p>
<p>「好！讓這幅永不完成的傑作題上『仰望』二字罷！」我立刻報以同調的回答</p>
<h3>L托爾斯泰語錄</h3>
<p>— 金寗譯</p>
<p>人們在他的一生，面對着眞理，站在眞理逆射於他面前的光茫中，從黑暗走向光明的地位上；如果他看不到眞理的光茫，也看不到他所走過的道路，他便已經重跌入黑暗裏去；但是他所在地方如果能發現眞理的照射，他仍可以自由的選擇這邊或那邊的道路。</p>
<h3>色（三章）</h3>
<p>— 青果</p>
<p>紅</p>
<p>我怕黑晴。</p>
<p>而在我，人間是陌生的，夜路更是陌生的。</p>
<p>但堅強的信念要我繼續前進，我沒有理由呌脚步停留下來。</p>
<p>摸索在破爛而又陰冷，崎嶇而又陡峭的夜路上，我是怎樣迫切地需要一只燈啊！</p>
<p>那紅的燈，紅的火燄跳躍着的燈。</p>
<p>用燃燒着眞理的光的眼睛，用爆炸着戰鬥的歌的嘴唇點燃的燈是最紅不過的，最亮不渦的。</p>
<p>為了那麽一盞紅閃閃的，像花一樣太陽一樣，向我笑着的燈始終搖蕩在我的心野，我就不知道有什麼艱難和恐怖，畏懼和怯弱。</p>
<p>我奔走着，我歡快地奔走着。</p>
<p>這廣闊無邊的黑的原野上，貶着黯綠的燐火，扯着尖厲的風聲，更安排着深淵，交錯着荊棘</p>
<p>我奔走着，我大胆而驕傲地奔走着。</p>
<p>我需要一只燈啊，一只跳躍着紅的火燄的燈！</p>
<p>綠</p>
<p>我很渴。</p>
<p>熱情燒烤着我，熱情使我陷於渴的苦境。</p>
<p>因此，我有時也想灌一兩杯酒進肚里去。</p>
<p>我有不少的希冀，太多的理想。而勇敢的熱情常迷些起着助燃作用。——但我可渴得愈更厲害了。</p>
<p>需要酒啊！我需要綠色的酒啊！</p>
<p>用少女的生命，用孩子的夢釀造的酒是非常綠的；是綠得非常醉人的。</p>
<p>除了綠色的酒，我還喜悅綠色的草株，綠色的樹葉，綠色的蕾苞，和綠色的池沼與綠色的窗帘呢。</p>
<p>向着這火光熊熊的燎原，誰不有對於希冀與理想的渴望，但願這時代的巨鐘，酌滿了綠色的酒漿，讓我們儘情地喝吧。</p>
<p>是呀，綠色不就是希冀與理想的顏色嗎？而我乃是沉醉於不少的希冀與太多的理想的。</p>
<p>我需要綠的酒啊！</p>
<p>藍</p>
<p>我有一瓶這樣的墨水不很好麼！</p>
<p>深藍的，深藍的，用靑春，用愛，用眼淚溶化的。</p>
<p>然而，我無法找到它們，無法找齊它們。</p>
<p>我靈魂的瓶子永遠空着，我忍想的筆尖永遠銹着。</p>
<p>這人間，我知道了，是缺乏看靑春，愛和眼淚的啊！</p>
<p>如今各種各樣牌的墨水都淡得很，寫在紙上，看不淸楚，再經時間的磨蝕，便模糊了，褪變了。而賣墨水的老板仍舊不息地對顧客們嘮叨着：那是很好的墨水，深藍的，深藍的。</p>
<p>我還不會感到煩惱嗎？這年代要我學習呀，要我學習創作詩篇呀！</p>
<p>但淡得像灰色的墨水我不能用，</p>
<p>我迫切地需要着一瓶這樣的墨水，深藍的，深藍的，用靑春，用愛，用眼淚溶化的。（三月，蘇州。）</p>
<h3>一寸河寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉風</p>
<p>鶴—始終想不起來，……是不是那個「什麼秘密？」</p>
<p>萍—（笑了）大哥，我認為您最會搗鬼。</p>
<p>鶴—沒有搗鬼，我可以發誓！</p>
<p>萍—好了，好了，別翻了，這件事您不會記在手冊上的，（大慨鶴見又在搗鬼；假裝翻手冊。）不過就是那個「八」字！（聽到這裏，我們大家很興奮地，彼此瞧了一眼）。</p>
<p>鶴—嗤！…「八的秘密，記得了。可是我認為沒有什麽秘密，……</p>
<p>萍—不能那麽說，大哥，這是很重要的。臨動身的當口，青木老師再三叮嚀，他說這個秘密，只有兩三個人知道；呌我告訴您，要您和我一路合作，把這秘密的行動破壞！</p>
<p>鶴—那麼說，大概我也沒有知道道個內容？</p>
<p>萍—當然，…我想您不會知道，他們沒有用電訊，因要保守嚴密，計劃是差坂坥義一親身送到上海，南京，漢口，廣州，這幾個地方去的。現在還有三十幾小時就要發動第二步了。</p>
<p>鶴—第二步？</p>
<p>萍—是的！第一步已經發動，可沒有成功，那是上海方面的。第二步預動，似乎已經成功。可還沒有收到證實的情報。</p>
<p>鶴—單單我們兩個人就可破環？</p>
<p>萍—可以的；靑木老師說，保證可以。否則我也不會到中華來了。</p>
<p>鶴—究竟怎麽一回事，這般嚴重？</p>
<p>萍—北部戰事，軍部認為很有把握，本可告一段落。無奈少壯派野心極大，不願再等三四個月；那就是第二期大舉征華。前幾天他們軍事會議，秘密議決，正是這個「八」的秘密—由「八」的番號特工組，在「八」個先頭秘密總站，發動挑釁戰，引起「八」月一日的上海序幕大戰；「八」月「八」日的南京大暴動戰；「八」月十「八」廣州登陸的神經戰；「八」月十「八」同時在漢口發動恐怖大慘劇，遙遙呼應。他們預算「八」月二十「八」，津浦，平漢，兩路大軍，可以打通，甚至可以會合。那麼這八月二十八日，也許就是「支那屈膝」的簽字日。所以軍部把這個議決案，呌作「八」的秘密。</p>
<p>鶴—哈，有趣味得很！</p>
<p>萍—大哥，這並不是有趣的事，我們必得今晚趕到天津，拂曉以前，就得乘海上飛機到上海。今天二十九了，只有三十幾小時，我們必得把這計劃破壞了才好。</p>
<h3>悲多汶之聾</h3>
<p>— 吳顯齊</p>
<p>生來就具有一種熱情的，好動的氣質的悲多汶，他是易於感染一切社會的轉變的，在為庸醫所誤的逆境之中，年復一年的被痊癒的希望所欺騙，而最後終不得不墜入纏綿的聾症的痛苦中，去過一種寂寞孤單的生活。他的聽覺在前此本是保持着高度的敏銳，敏銳得和他同業的音樂家們都沒立或不曾享有過，現在，在同伴的聚會中，他已失去了數樂，失去了文雅的交談，失去了思想的對流。當絕對不能避免參加社交集會的時候，他幾乎是被迫像一個被逐者似地呆坐着；在他接近人們的時候，立即會感覺到火熱而焦燥的情緒，使人以為也或斷言他是隫世嫉俗的人。</p>
<p>在他寫給兄弟卡爾的信札上，就曾經這樣說：「這是如何羞恥啊，當旁人站在我的身邊，聽見遼遠的笛聲時，我却什麼也聽不見，或是當旁人遙聞牧童的歌唱時，我同樣地一些也聽不見，這些遭遇差不多驅我入於絕望，有時，我想，已站在自殺的邊綠——藝術便拉住了我的手。哦！這樣看來，除非我貢獻出洶湧於我心中的一切旋律，我是還不能離開這世界的，所以我延續了這可憐的生命——可，是憐的，空具有如此敏感的一個人，結局却為一點突變而從美境中　到醜惡裏來。人們告訴我，我必須以忍耐作引導。其實我已經忍耐過—。我還希望自己決心忍受下去」</p>
<p>雖然如此，汎愛人類和向上的願望仍存在於他的內心藝術鼓舞他不強迫改行——他曾企圖改行為哲學家——而德行則同時阻止他自殺，呌他百折不撓的奮鬥。儘管大自然在他生命的旅途上安下許多障礙，但他却靠着自已的力量做了一切事業，而擠身於傑出的藝術家和偉大人物的行列</p>
<p>聽聽他響亮動人的話：「就讓一切這樣吧！我很快活的急於面對死。假如他在我乘機發展我所有藝術才能之前到來的話，縱然我的命運是壞的，而他究竟嫌太急促了，我很希望他來遲一點——但是如果修眞來得急促，我也很快活，因爲他不正是護送我逃出一個無盡的苦難嗎？無論什麼時候，你願來便來罷！我將勇敢地面對你。」</p>
<p>這是道麽的悲壯呵！悲多汶的一生就是莊嚴雄偉的交響樂。他不僅用音樂的奶汗哺養了後一代，並且還用他大無畏的精神戰勝了死。</p>
<p>死亡不過是一種休息，而藝術却是永生的。</p>

<h3>達摩</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<h3>「不明白」的洋老虎</h3>
<p>— 常楚</p>
<p>經濟緊急措施方案頒布以後，第一個被捕的，是一頭洋老虎，他的罪名是違法買賣外匯外幣，對緊急措施方案故意違背，於二月十七日後仍繼續經營此種業務，而且其所進出之美鈔，並不照官價一萬二千元之規定，觸犯緊急措施方案第七條。</p>
<p>日前這頭洋老虎首次開審，據他自供，對於所有違法行為，都由於不明白中國法規，致蹈法網，這是一種託辭，然而託辭之後，却有着嚴重的心理背景，</p>
<p>不明白中國法規，有三種解釋。第一是糊塗。我們看這位身任洋行外匯經理的老虎，年紀已經一把，決不糊塗。第二是由於入中國而不必問中國之禁的習慣，一向認為外商在中國尤其在上海是處於「化外」的地位，可以不必管中國的法律，祗管做於自己有利的事。雖然該老虎所屬的荷蘭。早於民國二十年即與中國簽訂條約，取消了在華僑民領事裁判權的享受，可是積習難反，總多多少少跳在中國的法律圈外。習慣成自然，至今未改，就把中國法規忽略不顧了。</p>
<p>第三個解釋，是明明知道違法，却利令智昏，妄想在一個騷動的市場之中，做些混永撈魚的勾當。他也許看見別人做了不少違法的事兒，至今逍遙法外，也許自己一直在幹着這一套，從來沒有碰過釘子，更眼看着許多視法令如弁毛的中國官商，大發其投機之財，於是把心一橫，也就幹將起來；道第三種解釋，可能性最大。</p>
<p>這話也就是說，洋老虎之一不明白」者，實實在在是看得太明白了。在中國為非作歹的少數洋人，都是把中國這部「老醫」讀得太通的分子。</p>
<p>可是現在這頭洋老虎却裝起糊塗來說自己不明白了。唯一處置他的方法，就是使他大大地明白過來。</p>
<p>可是話得說回來，單是一頭洋老虎明白了恐怕還是不够的吧。</p>

<h3>「禁舞」</h3>
<p>— 青虹</p>
<p>出席一個會議自免不了要有一番發言提議之類，說到發言提議，却也大非易事。老實話不能說，說了也不受歡迎，設或再一不留神刺痛了別人，則後患更大。可是閉口無言，似又愧對了這榮居會員的身份。</p>
<p>於是聰明人就發明了一套發言的邏輯，中華古國數千年來，講究的是「粉飾」，注重的是「外表」，格言是「家醜不可外揚」，據此就尋出了可做的文章，例如某公約「嚴禁跳舞營業提案」之類。</p>
<p>禁舞有節的之功，一也；禁舞足正風化，二也；禁舞可消滅都市罪惡，三也；……此外非惟不慮「後患」，且大足一表衛道者儼然的聲容，誠一舉而數得也。</p>
<p>至若舞女失業淪爲娟妓，活該—祗怪自己不長進，而嫖妓宿娼本就是「關着門的事」，自較舞塲中「公然」玩舞女為合理，至若對那些過份「飽暖」的人物的便利，那儘可以姬妾充下陳，享實惠而仍合於不「外揚」的原則。</p>
<h3>向郵局建議</h3>
<p>— 紅雨</p>
<p>這一陣子郵務當局，正在積極整頓業務，除設立了五處特種郵筒，收受夜班郵件，當喪父火車郵局，遞送京滬沿綫各埠外，還預備在本埠，實行分區投遞，以期特別迅捷。所以我們這幾天，所收到的信件，在信封後面，都貼上一張「快，快，快，」的顏色不同的郵務宣傳品。使人們腦筋裏，都印了一個國營事業，完全不馬虎的好觀念。</p>
<p>郵務當局，還在計劃超速率的投遞程序。將組織訪問團，分別向報館，學校，援關，社團及個人訪問，徽詢意覓，作為繼續改進的參考。該當局的虛懷若谷，和力求集思廣益的情神，確實顯示不是在處行故事了。</p>
<p>下走是一個來往信件不算少的份子，瞧見報上有小型信箱出售，便在就近郵局購置了一隻，式樣果然靈便，質料也很堅固。可是有一個缺點，印刷品像書報之類，是無法投進去的。鄙意該箱相的入口，可以在項端挖孔，放大一些，那麼印刷物也可以投進去了。倘使照原樣不加更動的話，大可在橫邊，另裝一個鉛皮筒子，那麼印件也可附插在裏邊兒了。還有裝這信箱的，只限於投入，而並不便利於寄出。在郵務當局止在徵詢意見的時候，爰特供獻　議如下：在每戶特裝小型信箱的人家，宜另附一具寄了信箱，凡平信印刷物，投寄人置在其內，按日由送僧人，成收信員，取收數次，那麽便利迅捷，一定裝置小型信箱的人家，必定益發多了。而對於互相投遞的迅捷，也一定獲得更好效果的。</p>

<h3>「還我自由」</h3>
<p>— 星雲</p>
<p>在反納粹的影片中，這是一張優秀的作品。它記述一九三六年德國七個政治思想犯，由集中營裏逃出來，這七個人，一個小說家，一個音樂家，一個工人，一個敎授，……結果他們中間的穴個人，都被捕帶同集中營而被處死刑，懸綁於十字架上，祗剩下喬治一人，飽經危險，並經過地下工作同志的帮助，他才逃出虎口，而逃亡荷蘭。</p>
<p>劇本編製及導演手腕，俱極練達，簡潔，全劇氣氛，在導演鏡頭運用的精湛，以及許多場面處理之富有人情味，它為我們鈎劃了一幅生動有力反納粹的史書！</p>
<p>你看幾個鏡頭的運用，多麽動人：喬治疲勞飢餓地躺在教堂裏，由聖母的像，化入他過去的愛人，過去的生活；納粹軍警疾馳而來，喬治作閃躱之狀，軍警急馳而過，下面只用幾個鏡頭倒敍喬治因手攀牆上尖銳的玻璃片，而跳過牆去，致手掌受傷的渦程；是可以作爲我們效法的。</p>
<p>其餘如保羅被捕後釋放歸來，保羅由門廉中伸出頭來苦笑，他妻子孤單地坐在那裏，看到丈夫，認眞而高興地痛哭地起來，一笑一哭，寫盡了反納粹正義感小夫妻的歡樂與悽苦。</p>
<p>又如音樂家被追捕的一場；集中營烟霧彌漫中的十字架；都現出多麼慘厲。</p>
<p>史本塞屈賽演喬治，深沉而簡練，不愧為一優越成功的老演</p>
<p>女主角薩妮哈莎，戲太少了一點。</p>
<p>喬治摯友保羅，被捕再行釋放，似乎是不可能的。不知是不是劇作者想加重一點喜劇的氣氛？</p>
<p>總之，這是「吾土吾民」以後，一部反納粹的好片子，值得一看。</p>
<h3>「探醉表」</h3>
<p>— 中光</p>
<p>—喝醉了酒的人，將不許駕駛車子。</p>
<p>美國每年度汽車肇事的數字確乎驚人，其中因酒醉後駕駛而闖禍者日漸增多。最近，密希根未然，特在每輛巡邏警車上加配一具「探醉表」。</p>
<p>「探醉表」的構造極之簡單，它是一個特別設計的玩具氣球。當警察遇見有飲酒過度嫌疑的司機時，就立即喝令其停車，然後吩咐他把氣吹入這個氣球內。於是貯藏在裘面的化學品便能够自動記錄他肺部和血液所含酒精</p>
<p>醫學理論說：人體血液含有酒精百分之·〇〇二以下時，可認為酒醒。濃度若介於百分之。〇五至·一五中間時，這個人已經不適宜去駕駛。如果在百分之一。五以上的話，那末他十足到了泥醉顛倒的階段了。</p>
<p>「探醉表」是由一位醫師名呌福萊斯德傳士（Dr.　Glenn　C.forrester）根據上述學說而發明的。氣球內裝置玻璃試管一支。裏面放滿了玻璃粒子，攙雜少許紫色的氧化劑。從這紫顏色消褪的一點，便可當場判定有喝酒過度娥疑的司機事前曾經飲下的酒量了，因為氣息內酒精愈含得多，紫顏色愈消失得快呢。</p>
<h3>酒血羊膏</h3>
<p>— 陳德聲</p>
<p>閒來無事，偶翻舊籍，閱得「滿斟美酒千人血，細割肥羊萬民膏。」憶與去歲自由談披靈拙作中「燭淚落時民淚落，歌聲高處怨聲高」二句，適相吻合！惟多飲美酒，過貪肥羊，將來必有口腹之禍。質諸朝飲美酒晚食肥羊者，以為然吾？</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>小沈也從餐室裏走出來，臉上透着關切的神氣，一面凑這個機會，貪婪地望着蘭的臉龐，以致於全身。</p>
<p>「呌阿史找找去！」徐胖子斜靠在簌椅上，漫不經心地說。他一生就只認定貨和鈔票是最重要的東西，一個親戚家的女孩子算得什麽？</p>
<p>蘭已經自己　進表了，一路狂喊「阿史。」</p>
<p>忽然緊急警報也拉起來了。</p>
<p>徐胖子和話老頭兒也不禁勃然色變，一齊離開了餐桌。</p>
<p>「不對！」小沈顯得很機警地說：「這一定是日本空軍利用了衡陽的飛機場，所以來得這麽快。今晚說不定眞要轟炸了！」</p>
<p>大家立刻就忙亂起來。徐胖子急念奔上樓去，收拾緊要的東西，準備帶着躱警報。</p>
<p>「這兒躱警報是不是在老君洞？」諸老頭兒跟定着小沈問。他到桂林還不久，對於空襲當然不能像老桂林那樣的鎮定。</p>
<p>小沈不大愛理他，祗點點頭，便往裏面　去；他的意思是想去找蘭，看有沒有可以獻一番殷勤的機會。</p>
<p>但蘭和阿史已忽想地趕出來了。</p>
<p>「……走不了的！不在東邊王家，便在後面小鋪子裏……。」阿史一路走，一路在嘰咕着；又像自語，又像在安慰蘭。</p>
<p>「阿史！阿史！快來拿箱子！」徐紹明站在樓梯口大喊。</p>
<p>外面街道上漸漸起了騷動的聲音。耳覺比較靈敏的人同時也可以聽到一陣「嗡嗡」的響聲，自遠處的天空裏傳來。</p>
<p>阿史顯得有些窘，不知道應該先帶着主人的親戚出去找孩子還是先趕上樓去給主人提箱子；但時間已不容許他考慮，徐紹明又在樓上喚他了。這一次還用脚狠狠地在樓板上頓了兩下，顯然有此蕉燥了。</p>
<p>「可是，明表弟……！」蘭帶着哭聲喊，她想和徐紹明爭一下。</p>
<p>但阿史已經上樓了。</p>
<p>好半天沒有說話的祝兆年，突然推開了遮在他面前的諸協理和小沈，連跳帶跑的往外就走。</p>
<p>「別怕！蘭，沒有阿史同去，我一個人也會把緋緋找回來的！」他頭也不回地說。（二）（五）</p>

<h3>End of the Plenary Session Marks the Start of the End of One-Party Rule and the Return of Power to the People: Minister Peng's Remarks to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Third Plenary Session discussed the issue of consulting with various parties on the reorganization of the government and other political matters, and it has been decided to entrust the Standing Committee with the responsibility for handling this.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The proposals completed by the Third Plenary Session will be submitted to the Standing Committee for decision. The important proposals to be decided are: (1) Vice Chairman of the National Government, (2) National Government Committee members of the Kuomintang, (3) Candidates for Premier of the Executive Yuan, and (4) Decisions on personnel of the National Government. It is heard that the candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan has already been internally decided.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 5:00 PM. Minister Peng answered reporters' questions as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What is the political outlook after the Third Plenary Session? When will the government reorganization be completed?</p>
<p>Minister Peng replied: The Kuomintang has completed three major missions: (1) overthrowing the imperial system, (2) overthrowing the warlords, and (3) defeating the Japanese invasion. Currently, the target of the revolution is the violent terrorists who attempt to conquer the majority with the minority. On the active front, the Kuomintang aims to establish constitutional governance and enrich the people's livelihood. The theme of the Third Plenary Session is to end the politics of one-party responsibility. From today onwards, the Kuomintang will begin to return power to the people. The reorganization of the National Government Committee is expected to be completed within this month, followed by the reorganization of the Executive Yuan. However, reorganizing the government is an easy task, and the realization of democratic governance depends entirely on the responsibility and discipline of the entire nation. We should not overemphasize changes in government personnel and neglect the prerequisites for the success of democratic constitutionalism.</p>
<p>Question: What is the recent military situation?</p>
<p>Answer: In the Northeast, the Communist army is attacking Tonghua, but it is not a cause for concern. In Shandong, the National Army recovered Dongping on the 23rd and Dong'a on the 24th. In Shaanxi, the National Army is pursuing the Communist army that is retreating towards Qingjian and Suide. Soon, northern Shaanxi west of the Yellow River will be completely pacified.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Yu Youren recently submitted the following opinions to relevant parties regarding the draft organization law of the Supervisory Yuan: The name of the Audit Department should remain the same, or if it is absolutely necessary to change it, it should be changed to "Audit General Office" to distinguish it from the provincial audit offices. Another suggestion by Yu is that the Supervisory Yuan should add an Investigation Department to handle investigation cases and collect relevant information. It is also heard that the number of supervisory committee members will be increased to around 200 in the future, and the number of committees will also be increased.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan's 780th Meeting Approves the Establishment of a Land Administration Bureau in Shandong Province, Increases the Variety and Quantity of Daily Necessities for Industrial Workers, and Appoints Long Dajun as Director of the Control Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs</h3>

(2) Appointed Fang Zhaohao as Director of the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications. (3) Appointed Zhao Bingqi as Secretary-General of the Provisional Consultative Council of Rehe Province. (4) Appointed Liu Junsheng as acting judge and division head of the Ningxia High Court. (5) Appointed Zhou Dashi as a member of the Guizhou Provincial Government.

<h3>Professional Groups Strive for Quotas for National Assembly Representatives</h3>
<p>Chen Da of the Ministry of Social Affairs Presents Opinions to the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] As constitutional government is imminent, and the election laws for National Assembly representatives and legislators are about to be formulated and promulgated, it is rumored that the Legislative Yuan's Review Committee will reduce the quota of representatives from professional groups to the lowest proportion. This not only ignores the importance of various professional groups but also violates national policy, causing widespread anxiety. Therefore, a joint meeting was held at the Central Hotel at 9:00 AM on the 25th. Representatives from various groups, including Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yunxu, Wang Yisheng, Zhuo Zonghai, Jiang Yiping, Xiong Guoqing, Shen Jiuxiang, and Gu Yuxiu, a total of thirty people, attended. Wang Xiaolian was elected as the chairman. After reporting the purpose of the meeting, it was decided to go to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Social Affairs to submit a telegram, stating the five major reasons why the quota of professional representatives must be equal to the quota of regional representatives. Subsequently, Minister Gu Zhenggang personally received them, expressed his acceptance, and promised to convey it to the National Defense Council, saying that the Legislative Yuan was paying attention. In the afternoon, they went to the Legislative Yuan again. As President Sun was not present, it was decided to meet and talk with him on the morning of the 26th, and to invite all legislators at 2:00 PM on the 26th to exchange opinions.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang and His Wife to Return Home to Sweep Tombs</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 25th] Chairman Chiang and his wife will go to their hometown Fenghua around Qingming to sweep the tombs and take the opportunity to visit the West Lake in Hangzhou to enjoy the spring scenery. The Chairman's official residence has been renovated, and places of interest have also been cleaned. The people of Hangzhou are eagerly anticipating seeing the Chairman's demeanor, and the West Lake will also shine because of this.</p>
<h3>The Democratic Socialist Party Scheduled to Hold Central Standing Committee Routine Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Zhang Junmai's Trip to India Likely to Be Called Off</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party is scheduled to hold a routine meeting of the Central Standing Committee this afternoon to study concrete implementation measures for the common governance program and discuss matters such as government committee personnel. Jiang Yuntian will go to Nanjing after today's meeting. The party also sent a telegram yesterday urging Wu Xianshi, who is in Hong Kong, to come to Shanghai immediately to discuss matters together. Hu Haimen, who is currently staying in the north, also plans to come to Shanghai in the next few days. As Chairman Chiang asked Zhang Junmai to study concrete measures for the Executive Yuan to be responsible to the Legislative Yuan, and many party affairs are pending decision, his trip to India to attend the Pan-Asian Conference will likely be called off.</p>
<h3>Garrison Headquarters Announces the Course of the Suppression of the Rebellion in Tainan</h3>
<p>Ring Leaders like Tu Guangming Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tainan, 25th] The Southern Taiwan Garrison Headquarters announced the course of the suppression of the southern rebellion in the past half-month, stating: Since the 3rd of this month, rebellions have occurred successively in various places south of Chiayi. The National Army has repeatedly exercised restraint and strived for a peaceful resolution. However, in addition to arbitrarily beating mainlanders, the rioters have become even more intensified. On the evening of the 6th, the rebel leader Tu Guangming and others, hiding weapons, also coerced Kaohsiung Mayor Huang Zhongge to accompany them to the Fortress Headquarters to make various excessive demands to Commander Peng Mengji, such as taking over the arms depots and disarming the troops. Commander Peng sternly refused, and Tu and others even drew their guns. Fortunately, bystanders intervened and embraced them, and Tu and two accomplices were detained together. As the situation developed to this point, Peng also took decisive measures. He ordered the dispatch of troops to suppress the rebellion. It was not until the 8th that order was restored in the Kaohsiung urban area. Fengshan was pacified on the 7th, Pingtung on the 8th, Gangshan on the 9th, Tainan on the 10th, and Xinying on the 11th. As of now, the various units have seized civilian ammunition, which belongs to the headquarters. There are more than 480 rifles, 25 light machine guns, 7 heavy machine guns, more than 30 pistols, 120,000 rounds of ammunition, and countless military sabers (excluding Tainan and Chiayi). More than several hundred suspects have been detained. The rioter Tu and two others have been executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Compensation Measures for Teachers and Staff Killed or Injured in Taiwan Promulgated</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th] The Taiwan Provincial Government recently promulgated measures for compensation and relief for public school personnel, regardless of their origin, who were killed, injured, or suffered losses in the "February 28th" incident: (1) Those who died will receive a one-time funeral compensation of 200,000 Taiwan dollars; (2) Those with minor injuries will receive a relief fund of 5,000 Taiwan dollars, and those with serious injuries will receive 50,000 Taiwan dollars; (3) Relief for property losses will be limited to clothing and bedding. Each set of clothing will receive a relief fund of 10,000 Taiwan dollars, limited to two sets each for winter and summer, and bedding is limited to one set, totaling 2,000 Taiwan dollars; (4) Those who have suffered particularly severe losses will be given special relief funds.</p>
<h3>He Siyuan Speaks in Nanjing About the Truth of the Census in Beiping: There Is Conclusive Evidence of the Communist Party's Conspiracy to Riot</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Regarding the details of the Beiping police and security agencies' census on February 18th and the detention of several criminals, Beiping Mayor He Siyuan told reporters before returning to Beiping on the 25th: "In the week before February 18th, the Communist army had the following riotous and terrorist acts: (1) Disguised as farmers and merchants, they sneaked into Tongxian, 20 kilometers from Beiping, occupied the county seat at night, burned houses, and massacred people, and disturbed the peace 2 kilometers outside Yongdingmen in Beiping. (2) Destroyed the power plants that supply Beiping with tap water, trams, and radio station power. (3) Robbed the special express train on the Pingjin Railway and bombed railway bridges, causing the Pingjin train to be out of service for two days. (4) Declared an attack on Beiping. Communist spies were lurking in Beiping City. When the Communist army disturbed the suburbs on the 21st, they responded with gunfire, and the citizens were startled several times in one night. (5) Communist spies conspired to riot, and robberies occurred repeatedly. In addition, a U.S. military officer was shot and killed on the streets of Beiping. At that time, Beiping had fallen into a state of wartime terror. The battle near Xushui Baoding along the Pingbao line was fierce. The people of Beiping and the press requested the government to quickly seek countermeasures. The census was conducted based on this situation. On February 18th, the Beiping Police Department conducted a citywide census. A total of 1,165 cases of unreported households and 176 cases of people without national identity cards were found. They were ordered to go to the police station to complete the procedures and were released within 24 hours. There were also 114 cases of opium addicts, 5 cases of private possession of military firearms, and 181 cases of gambling. They were all released after 24 hours. A few were handed over to military agencies. Most of these criminals have been released after being punished according to law. In addition, seven people confessed to being members of the Chinese Communist Party and committing crimes of attempting to assassinate, set fire, destroy railways, and destroy water and electricity. There is conclusive evidence, and they will all be punished according to law. Among them, one person, named Wang Quan, is a Tsinghua student who admitted to participating in the Communist Party's riot conspiracy. Because he is a young student, he has been allowed to be released on bail by the school authorities. The list and punishment details can be announced after I return to Beiping if necessary. However, in a large city with a population of 1.8 million, the technical difficulties of conducting inspections are almost unavoidable. For example, Guoxue scholar Fu Dingyi, a dentist, and a female employee of the Police Relief General Administration were misunderstandings caused by technical difficulties, but once proven, they were released immediately, and I personally went to express my condolences. As for the rumors of arresting a large number of liberals, this is a common propaganda tactic of the Communist Party. If anyone can provide the name of a liberal who was arrested, I will immediately investigate and announce the truth. The situation at the time was very tense, so it was not possible to seek instructions from the central government in advance. It is the government's responsibility to impose legal sanctions on conspiracies to riot, disrupt public order, bandits, and spies, and to legally correct those who privately possess military firearms, gather for gambling, fail to report households, and impersonate and lurk. The general Communist periphery keeps silent about the Communist army's destruction of roads, digging of embankments, massacre of innocent people, riots, and disturbances, and only opposes the government's legitimate administrative actions to protect the people's lives and property, which is not the attitude that true liberals should have."</p>

<h3>A Major Battle Is Brewing on the Border Between Shaanxi and Shanxi: The Area Near Yan'an Is Cleared and Ansai Is Recovered: National Army of the Twelfth War Zone Enters Zuoyun</h3>

<p>[Another Dispatch] After suffering an unprecedented blow, the Communist army in northern Shaanxi is now gathering remnants in Anzhai, Qingjian, Yanchang, Suide, Wayaobao, and other places, and urgently transferring troops from northwestern Shanxi to the Suide and Qingjian areas in Shaanxi, launching an offensive and still dreaming of returning to the old nest.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] Another battle is brewing on the border between Shaanxi and Shanxi. Both sides are stationing troops on both sides of the Yellow River, and the prelude to the decisive battle is about to begin. The Communist army intends to defend Suide in order to cover the transportation of a large amount of materials into Shanxi. The opening of the Xianyu Highway is not far off.</p>
<p>[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 25th] At 6:00 PM on the 24th, the National Army recovered Ansai. The remaining Communists continued to retreat to the north towards Long'anzhen and other areas.

<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] It is learned that a part of the National Army that recovered Yan'an and went north had reached the vicinity of Panlong, 90 li north of Yan'an, by the morning of the 24th.

<h3>Legislative Yuan's 319th Regular Meeting Passes National Assembly Organization Law</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office on the 25th] This morning, the People's Socialist Party legislators attended the Legislative Yuan regular meeting for the first time. When new legislators such as Dang Zhushi Xian, Cui Xinyi, Sun Qu, and Ji Jingxuan were introduced to the attendees, the entire hall responded with applause.</p>
<p>The National Assembly Organization Law proposal was passed at the Legislative Yuan's fourth session, 319th regular meeting this morning. The draft law on the election and recall of National Assembly representatives was also discussed at the meeting. However, due to some points still needing further study, it was resolved to send it to the Constitution and Law Committee for review, to be presented at the 320th regular meeting on the 27th. President Sun chaired today's meeting. After the meeting began, the entire assembly observed a moment of silence for the recently deceased legislator Zhang Fengjiu. Then, the National Assembly Organization Law was discussed, with Liu Kezhuang, chairman of the Constitution and Law Committee, explaining that the review results were not significantly different from the original proposal from the National Defense Committee. Articles 4 and 10 were only amended in wording. Article 13 of the original proposal stipulated the establishment of one usher and two deputy ushers to maintain order in the assembly hall under the president's orders. During the review, it was argued that this could lead to improper interference and disputes, so it was proposed to cancel this provision. Article 14 (originally Article 15) stipulated that each National Assembly session should adjourn itself after completing its tasks, which was changed to "shall adjourn immediately upon completion of its tasks."</p>
<p>Legislator Lu then spoke, stating that constitutional laws are of great importance and that they should be studied in detail and deliberated carefully, without rushing. Sun Jiulu also expressed the same sentiment. However, Liu Kezhuang believed that according to the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the Constitution, all relevant constitutional laws should be formulated within three months after the Constitution is promulgated. The meeting then decided to continue the discussion.</p>
<p>Legislators debated fiercely over the need to establish ushers in the National Assembly. President Sun pointed out that other countries have ushers, but this is a new concept in China. Lin Bin and others believed that if the president could exert his authority, order would not be difficult to maintain. If ushers were established and interfered improperly, it could cause disturbances. It was also argued that not establishing ushers was acceptable. Xia Erkang also believed that having ushers could make maintaining order more difficult.</p>
<p>Jian Guansan and others believed that it was necessary to establish ushers, pointing out that in an assembly hall with around 3,000 people, disorder was predictable without ushers. Sheng Zhenwei also believed that practicing democracy required cultivating a habit of maintaining order, and without ushers, direct conflicts would occur between the president and representatives.</p>
<p>Chen Guyuan and others proposed compromise solutions, suggesting that ushers be selected from among the representatives by the Discipline Committee, or that the president concurrently serve as usher. In the final vote, the review opinion was passed, and the National Assembly will not have ushers.</p>
<p>Another contested issue was the number of members in the presidium. Lin Bin believed that based on past experience, having too many members in the presidium was not very beneficial, but increasing the number of 25 was acceptable. Zhao Naiquan believed that increasing the number was unnecessary, and Chen Ruxuan believed that one president and one or two vice presidents were sufficient. In the vote, the original proposal was passed, and the National Assembly will have a presidium composed of 25 members elected by the attending representatives.</p>
<p>The Draft Law on the Election and Recall of National Assembly Representatives Has Been Sent to the Constitutional and Legal Committee for Study</p>
<p>Regarding whether the term of the National Assembly should be specified, Wang Yuxiang believed that it should be specified. Zhong Tianxin believed that if the organizational law stipulated matters not stipulated in the Constitution, it would inevitably be suspected of violating the Constitution. Lin Bin explained that the reasons for convening the National Assembly in the future would be inconsistent, the tasks would be different, and the terms would naturally vary. Making rigid stipulations in advance would not be appropriate. It was decided to pass the review opinion.</p>
<p>The draft law on the election and recall of National Assembly representatives was then discussed. Liu Kezhuang explained the review process, pointing out that the main point of contention was the allocation of seats. Regarding the qualifications of electors and candidates in Article 5, the phrase "dereliction of duty" in the original draft was deleted after review and replaced with the second clause, "those who have been convicted of corruption while serving in public office." A new clause was added, "those who use opium or other substitutes." Article 6 involves the right to elect and be elected for naturalized citizens. The original draft did not mention the right to be elected. It is now stipulated that naturalized citizens who have been naturalized for ten years and meet the requirements have the right to be elected. Article 9 concerns the electoral roll. The original draft stipulated that there should only be one copy, which would be vulnerable to damage and forgery. During the review, it was changed to two copies, a primary and a secondary, for easy reference. Article 12 stipulates the number of nominators for candidates. The original proposal stipulated that candidates must be nominated by 100 electors. There was consideration to increase this number, but the original number was retained, with the addition of "or nominated by a political party." Chapter 3 stipulates the organization of election authorities. After the review, an election commission was added to the Central Election Office, with the chief supervisor of elections serving as chairman. Some legislators believed that after having an election commission, there was no need to have a chief supervisor, but it was decided to retain this provision for the assembly to decide.</p>
<p>After the report, Ke Tuzong and others spoke, raising three questions about the election regulations: (1) The Central Election Office is determined by law. How will the law stipulate it? (2) There is a chief supervisor of elections before there is an election commission. Some people worry that people may be unwilling to serve as committee members. Mr. Qu himself does not agree that the supervisor concurrently serves as chairman of the commission. Peng Shishi and others expressed disagreement with the population calculation method. Jian Zhener believed that there were many differences between the election and recall of National Assembly representatives and the election and recall of legislators. It was necessary to send it to the Law Committee for review. Finally, it was decided to send the case to the Constitutional Law Committee for study in comparison with the legislator election and recall law, and then submit it to the regular meeting on the 27th for public decision.</p>

<h3>National Army in Western Shandong Enters Pingyin, 20,000 of Liu Bocheng's Remnants North of the Dawen River Are Encircled, Communist Army Repeatedly Thwarted on the Outskirts of Jinan</h3>
<p>[Report from our Xuzhou office on the 25th] After retaking Dong'a at 2 PM on the 24th, the National Army in Western Shandong continued to pursue the retreating Communist army, crossing Wangguandian at noon on the 25th and entering Pingyin at 4 PM. The regiment advancing northeast from Dongping retook Huangshan, Putaoshan, Donghengyu on the 24th, and continued to mop up the area 18 li southwest of Feicheng on the 25th. The National Army advancing northwest from Taiwenkou has bypassed the north of Dakou and retook Caozhuang and Manzhuang on the west side of the Jinpu Railway after retaking Nanliu. They are now directly pointing at Man'an.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The situation in Western Shandong has taken a sharp turn for the worse. The National Army north of the Dawen River has been advancing in a fan shape on the Communist army in the triangular area between the Jinpu Railway and the Yellow River. About 20,000 of Liu Bocheng's remnants in the area have been encircled. The Yellow River is now over 5 meters deep, making it impossible for the Communist army to cross the river and flee westward.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 25th] After retaking Dong'a on the 24th, the National Army in Western Shandong continued to mop up northeastward, advancing in two routes today. One route has reached Fengkongjia Village (south of Pingyin), and the other has reached near Shiliulangkou. The vanguard has already pointed towards Feicheng, where the National Army is expected to meet Wang Yaowu's unit in Jinan ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>[Report from our Jinan office on the 25th] The Communist army on the outskirts of Jinan is now attacking the National Army positions continuously every night. The fighting on the northeast side is more intense. One division of the Communist army's main force attacked Guodian and Wang Sheren Village at 9 PM on the 24th, sending people to Guodian Railway Station to plant landmines in an attempt to blow up the National Army armored vehicles. The National Army bravely fought back and drove away the Communist army attempting to blow up the armored vehicles. Fierce fighting continued overnight in both locations. By dawn on the 25th, the Communist army had retreated in defeat. During the fighting, a Communist army force briefly charged outside the east wall of the Chengcheng County Government in Wang Sheren Village, but was repelled by the county government's security forces, averting a crisis.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Communist army attacking Guodian, Hancang, East and West Liujia Village on the outskirts of Jinan was repelled by a strong National Army unit by the morning of the 25th. In the afternoon of the 25th, over a thousand Communist army troops from the southeast of Sangzidian, north of the Yellow River, were repelled by the National Army's armored vehicles. Despite repeated setbacks, the Communist army is still moving frequently, and is also stockpiling large amounts of grain and ammunition in Longshan, 25 kilometers east of Jinan, in Xiaokou, 35 kilometers north of Jinan, and in Yucheng, 40 kilometers northwest of Jinan, seemingly not abandoning its attempt to besiege Jinan.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Invading Tonghua Completely Defeated and Fleeing Eastward</h3>

<p>The Entire City of Shenyang Plunged into Darkness</p>
<p>[Report from our Shenyang office on the 25th] The city was plunged into darkness again from 1:40 AM this morning. This is because the Communist army has severely damaged the Xiaofengman-Shenyang power transmission line north of Meihekou. The power bureau can send a repair team to the damaged site for repairs on the 26th. During the repair period, power will be temporarily supplied by the Fushun Power Plant.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Submits Opinions on This Year's Grain Collection and Procurement, Arguing that Famine Relief Is Impossible Without Control of Actual Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from our Hangzhou office on the 25th] Chairman Shen returned to Hangzhou from Nanjing yesterday and attended the provincial government meeting today. According to Shen, the central government will continue to collect grain this year, but only in areas with convenient transportation and abundant grain production, and the rest will be collected in legal tender. The 20% of the grain collected that should go to the province and the 50% that should go to the county will be purchased by the central government at the average grain price of July, August, September of this year. The provincial government believes that this matter is of great importance and has dispatched Chen Yi, Director of the Field and Food Department, to Nanjing at 4 PM this afternoon to submit opinions to the Ministry of Food: (1) What are the standards for convenient transportation and sufficient grain production? (2) If all the actual goods obtained by the province and county are purchased by the central government, then the province and county will have no control over actual goods and will not be able to provide famine relief. (3) If the grain price in July, August, and September is low, the budgets of the province and county this year will not be balanced. How can the burden be evenly distributed among the grain-collecting counties?</p>
<p>According to provincial government sources, the central government also intends to revise the revenue and expenditure system, transferring the 30% of land tax that belongs to the central government and the 50% of business tax that belongs to the county to the provincial government, and the central government will no longer subsidize the province. According to this calculation, the Zhejiang provincial government can increase its revenue by 12 billion yuan, but it will still be short 24 billion yuan. Therefore, it has joined forces with the chairmen of other provincial governments and the two ministries of finance and food to request that the current practice be temporarily followed before the implementation of the Constitution, and that there be no major changes. However, the president has instructed that the 30% of land tax belonging to the central government cannot be transferred to the provincial government, so it seems that the revenue and expenditure system will not be changed immediately. The financial department has reviewed the budget of Zhejiang Province for the 36th year of the Republic, and the business tax has been tripled, calculated at 25,600 yuan per stone. Therefore, the budget can be balanced on the surface, but the Executive Yuan has not yet reviewed it. It is heard that the principle is that the central government subsidies will not be calculated according to the figures of the previous year, and subsidies will be provided if there is a shortfall in revenue and expenditure. Therefore, Minister of Finance Chen Milin and Chief Accountant Jing Tao have been instructed to stay in Nanjing and continue negotiations. The Ministry of Finance will not recognize the fictitious revenue figures. In addition, it is feared that the various project expenses originally listed by the province may be deleted, and negotiations have also been instructed to retain them. However, the central government has allowed that the increased expenditures for adjusting the living expenses of public school teachers and staff will be allocated by the central government.</p>
<h3>Grain Collection Conference To Reconvene Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing office on the 25th] The Grain Collection Conference will reconvene on the morning of the 26th to discuss ways to strengthen grain collection. The provincial chairmen and directors of the field and food departments of various provinces in Nanjing will all attend. The first Grain Collection Conference on the 23rd was personally chaired by President Chiang.</p>
<h3>American Businesses Invest in Guangdong Industries, Discussions Are Getting Closer</h3>
<p>[Report from our Chengdu office on the 25th] (1) Pan Yi, manager of the American-owned Pan-Li Company, and Li Shensheng, deputy manager, have repeatedly discussed with the Guangdong construction authorities about investing and running industries in this province, but the details have not yet been released. According to relevant sources, the company has requested the exclusive rights to undertake several major enterprises in this province, such as the cement plant, sugar factory, Wengjiang Hydropower Plant, provincial highways, transportation, telecommunications, construction of Huangpu Commercial Port, and shipyard, for a period of 30 to 50 years. The conditions put forward by our authorities are: (1) Each project must be completed within two years after the contract is signed at the latest; (2) All plans must be approved by the Provincial Assembly and the Central Government; (3) Be responsible for training technical personnel in this province; (4) Designate the location of the factories and the period of exclusive operation, etc. It is also heard that the discussions are getting closer. If successful, it will greatly benefit the construction of the province.</p>

<p>[Report from our Nanjing office on the 25th] Due to the losses of the post office, the government has decided to adopt a subsidy policy, so it is not planned to increase prices. The Directorate General of Posts had intended to increase prices threefold, and its petition had been submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council, but it has now been voluntarily withdrawn.

<h3>Security Meeting Held in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Prisoners in the Third Prison Briefly Rioted</p>
<p>[Report from our Wuxi office on the 25th] The 9th Regiment of the Gendarmerie stationed in Wuxi convened a security meeting with the heads of various townships today, deciding that any soldier caught looting the local self-defense force while wearing a uniform, with witnesses and evidence, may be executed on the spot.

First, Zhang Hongjun, Director of the Welfare Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs, delivered a speech, saying: The Ministry of Social Affairs convened a temporary meeting of representatives of social organizations in Nanjing. As a result, the following suggestions were provided to the Social Welfare Work Conference of the Administrative Relief and United Relief: (1) The Administrative Relief has welfare groups and various social welfare institutions. Please list the list so that it can be handed over in the future. (2) It is hoped that the Administrative Relief will transfer the post-relief materials to the relevant social administration authorities in the future, not only transferring responsibilities but also materials. (3) When transferring the good rescue undertakings, it is hoped that (A) there will be consumables (such as clothing and food), (B) there will be funds, and it is hoped that there will be a fund of about five years so that it can continue to be maintained. If there are difficulties in funding, part of the materials can be sold as a fund. (4) Emergency relief work. All agencies are still expected to continue to handle it before the end of the Administrative Relief. (5) Good rescue welfare institutions should be transferred in a planned and orderly manner to avoid affecting the work. (6) Grain, equipment, and materials should be transferred according to their nature and jointly received by various social organizations. (7) Good rescue agencies should be prepared before the transfer to avoid chaos. (8) Before the good rescue agency is terminated, please submit the plan to the social administration authority for review. (9) Please list the quantity of each material. (10) Transfer the amount of funds together. (11) The staff of the post-relief social welfare agency should also be listed in a list for transfer. Foreign personnel should also be retained as appropriate. (12) Administrative organizations that do not meet the regulations should be improved. (13) Assist in the development of the Good Rescue Association.</p>
<p>The General Assembly Passed Many Proposals</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the General Assembly discussed work relief issues and passed the following proposals: (1) The materials, tools, and equipment supplied by the United Relief to the Administrative Relief to relieve Sichuan will be transferred to government agencies registered with the Chinese government, non-profit organizations, and cooperatives. In the future, they should be used exclusively for welfare undertakings, including employing the poor for work relief. (2) In any future work relief work, special attention should be paid to the application of equipment. It must be matched with different work according to different abilities. The authorities responsible for managing work relief should assess each person's skills and list them separately. (3) In the future, when various ministries, committees, bureaus, and offices of the government are implementing work relief, they should first employ the poor and capable people who are in urgent need of relief, and then recruit ordinary workers if there is a surplus. (4) When implementing work relief, all agencies should directly employ workers and avoid contractors who profit from relief materials. (5) The Administrative Relief should report the experience of training work relief personnel in the past to the Ministry of Social Affairs and other relevant agencies for reference in continuing to promote this work.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After Reading the Declaration of the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>The Sixth Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang was held from the 15th and closed on the 24th. A declaration was issued after the meeting, the full text of which was published in yesterday's newspaper. This conference was an unprecedentedly important gathering of the Kuomintang in the past twenty years, a decisive gathering to lead the victory of the war of resistance, return to the capital, promulgate the constitution, and end political tutelage. At the opening, President Chiang pointed out that the mission of this plenary session was to redefine the relationship between the party and the government, reform the Kuomintang, and enrich the Kuomintang, so that the party could still shoulder the responsibility of national construction after the end of political tutelage. In the declaration, the plenary session further listed five major goals to encourage party members and inform the people of the key tasks for future efforts.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang is currently the largest party in our country. For decades of revolutionary struggle, it has consistently implemented Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. It created the Republic of China, overthrew the warlords, led the victory of the War of Resistance, abolished unequal treaties, convened the National Assembly, and completed the democratic constitution. Its contributions to the country and the nation are so glorious that they illuminate the world and last forever. However, the period of political tutelage has been prolonged, the administration has not been completely clarified, and the number of people who attach themselves to others has increased day by day, inevitably leading to a mixture of different types of people. In addition, domestic party disputes are chaotic, so those who discuss national affairs with passion also have praise and criticism of the Kuomintang. However, the Kuomintang does not seek news based on praise and criticism, but can strive to reform itself, invigorate itself, and take responsibility. If everyone can have a bright and benevolent attitude and encourage and spur the Kuomintang, it is believed that the Kuomintang will be able to work hard and complete a new China of the Three Principles of the People. Because the Kuomintang has its glorious history, stands on the land with roots and foundations, and today is related to the weight of the country, being benevolent to others can naturally be good. The ancients said: "The roots that are deep, its leaves are luxuriant; the fat that is fertile, its light is bright." Therefore, we extend ourselves and others, and have infinite enthusiasm for the country and the Kuomintang. The five points mentioned in the declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang are: First, complete the preparations for constitutional government and establish a national construction framework; second, eliminate obstacles to unification and consolidate the national foundation; third, implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and stabilize the economic foundation; fourth, uphold international justice and dedicate ourselves to international peace; fifth, enrich educational content and cultivate the nation's vitality. After reading this declaration, we believe that the Kuomintang has a sense of responsibility. After the end of political tutelage, it can still put the country and the people first, not avoid suspicion, not be afraid, not be timid, and not retreat. Its loyalty can illuminate any demons and ghosts. However, the most correct principles and the most reasonable words are just the right thing to do, and the implementation is right: The Kuomintang is a political party that emphasizes knowing and doing, so it should focus on doing in the future. Zhu Xi said: "In terms of priority, knowledge comes first; in terms of importance, action comes first." The five points mentioned in the declaration of this Third Plenary Session are aimed at current malpractices and have their own weight, but they must be steadfastly struggled, "sincerely united, selfless and impartial, regardless of regions, regardless of parties, the more difficult, the more fierce, bravely move forward, and we will be able to overcome all difficulties, break through all obstacles, and complete the legacy of the National Father and complete the entire achievements of national construction"!</p>
<p>In short, after the end of political tutelage, the Kuomintang returned power to the people. The party went to the people and became an ordinary political party with other parties. The party and the people are two-in-one, or one-in-two. Therefore, the key points of the declaration of this Third Plenary Session and the motions passed by the Third Plenary Session have the voice of the people and the demands of the people. However, to make this voice new every day, not only should the Kuomintang grasp it as a policy advocacy and fight firmly in the future, but the reorganized government should also use it as a policy advocacy, so that the constitutional implementation can be expected and the national unification can be hoped for. As for the status of the Kuomintang after returning power to the people, the declaration also pointed out that "the position in which it is located, and its relationship with the government, will naturally be different from the past." However, the Kuomintang's fighting spirit, as long as it persists for a long time, the party will put the people first in the private sector, and it will be able to stand up among the people; the party will cooperate sincerely with friendly parties in the government, and it will be able to have endless friends, so-called "although nobility must be based on cheapness, although height must be based on the bottom." And constantly correcting shortcomings, distinguishing the important from the unimportant, and faithfully practicing, although the position in the future is different from the past, the vitality in the future will be more abundant than in the past.</p>
<p>The Third Plenary Session has closed, and the Third Plenary Session has its harvest in all aspects. This gathering is a turning point for the Kuomintang. The way to update is to create it yourself, and you have a straight road; if you still "decide but do not act" or act but derail, that is the misfortune of the party's future. The Kuomintang is now only watching the splendid and solemn bottom distant view, but this distant view is still to be hoped for but not reached. If you follow the straight road forward, you need the people as the backing and the parties as friends. Therefore, it is said that after the Kuomintang returns power to the people, it must strive for the people and strive for friends, so that it can achieve the splendor and solemnity of the future. After the Kuomintang ends political tutelage, it must be extra vigilant when it is equally pulled into political competition with other parties, and it must work extra hard to do a few things to restore the atmosphere, do a few things to boost people's hearts, and the Kuomintang can achieve the splendor and solemnity of the future in politics in the future. The declaration of the Third Plenary Session finally took "not being unworthy of the National Father and the martyrs, not being unworthy of the loyal martyrs of the War of Resistance and the compatriots who have been displaced and struggling after the war" as its own responsibility to encourage party members, and we also encouraged the Kuomintang with this!</p>

<h3>U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey Mostly Grants: Clayton Reveals at Foreign Affairs Committee</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 24th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee convened today to discuss President Truman's proposed aid to Greece and Turkey. Secretary of the Army Patterson, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, and Acting Secretary of State Acheson attended to present their views. Patterson urged Congress to promptly aid Greece to prevent communist-led armed forces from gaining control. Forrestal stated that four minesweepers had already been sold to Turkey, and both Greece and Turkey had requested to purchase more warships. Patterson and Acheson assured that the president's plan would not involve sending U.S. troops to Greece and Turkey. However, Assistant Secretary of State Clayton revealed to the House Foreign Affairs Committee that over half of the $400 million in support for Greece and Turkey against communism would be used for military purposes. This military expenditure would be entirely a grant rather than a loan to either country, and the majority of the remaining funds would likely be provided in the same manner. According to Acheson, only about $50 million is expected to be repaid to the United States.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] Republican Congressman Dirksen recently declared to the House of Representatives that the United States should negotiate an agreement with Greece and Turkey, whereby they would lease their naval and air bases to the United States for long periods as a condition for U.S. financial aid. Furthermore, Greece and Turkey should also make commercial concessions to the United States, he stated.</p>
<h3>Paul Reports to Truman</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Paul, who led the U.S. economic mission to Greece, visited President Truman at the White House today to report on the results of his inspection in Greece.</p>
<h3>Acheson Explains New U.S. Foreign Policy: Aid Plan for Korea Under Consideration</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 24th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today that if the democratic governments of Greece and Turkey do not receive support, chaos may erupt in the vast region between Greece, Turkey, and Liaodong, China, which would surely affect China, India, Burma, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, and Iraq. Acheson requested that the Senate approve legislation to implement President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey and prevent the expansion of totalitarianism in the Middle East. He stated that India is going through a difficult period with domestic disorder, and the situation would become unmanageable if the democratic government were to fail. South Korea also needs U.S. capital investment, and a plan to aid Korea will be submitted to Congress after the Army, Navy, and State Department have finalized their opinions. The scope of the aid is not yet determined, but Korea will need U.S. capital aid in the next three years. The U.S. government has not yet been able to unify Korea because the Soviet government has failed or is unwilling to discuss the unification issue.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Philippine Military Negotiations</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Manila, 25th] Philippine officials and the U.S. military delegation began negotiations today, aimed at incorporating the Philippines into the overall U.S. defense plan for the Western Pacific.

<h3>Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bullitt, Claims USSR Intends to Attack U.S.: If the USSR Had the Atomic Bomb, It Would Have Already Dropped It on the U.S.</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 24th] The House Un-American Activities Committee heard a report from subcommittee chairman Green today, stating that there are at least 100,000 communists within the United States, enough to form ten army divisions, with the goal of weakening the United States in the event of a final Soviet attack. Earlier, former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bullitt, reported on the intentions of the Soviet Union, stating that if the Soviet Union had the atomic bomb, it would have already dropped it on the United States. The Soviet Union is not currently willing to attack, but is waiting until it has manufactured a large number of atomic bombs and feels that its air force is stronger than that of the United States. Until that time, we can comfortably tell Stalin to "stop," and if we are serious about it, Stalin will surely stop. But Stalin will never stop voluntarily, just like Hitler. Bullitt strongly suggested that the United States store a large number of atomic bombs for immediate use.</p>
<p>U.S. Intensifies Precautions Against Communists</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the American Legion agreed with the measures under discussion by the Un-American Activities Committee, which would make joining the Communist Party illegal, prohibit communists from running for office in federal or state elections, and prohibit the teaching of communism or the mailing of communist propaganda. Bullitt feared that Americans had not fully recognized the danger posed by the existence of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union's determination to conquer the United States, and did not believe that the American public would support the aforementioned severe penalties. Therefore, he proposed an alternative approach, advocating for increased funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to monitor communist activities, so that they could be rounded up in the event of an emergency, similar to how German-American Bund members were dealt with during the war.</p>

<h3>Coal Industry Association Lists Five Facts, Accuses Fuel Management Committee of Malfeasance: Delegation Returns from Petitioning in Nanjing, Discusses Process, Central Government Has Sent Investigators to Shanghai for Secret Investigation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association believes that the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has, without authorization from the Ministry, stopped allocating coal for civilian use since December 1946, causing business to cease for 296 companies in the industry. In addition to urgently cabling Chairman and President Chiang on February 5, requesting "allocation of coal resources to relieve coal merchants," a delegation consisting of Xie Hengchuang, Pan Yisan, Bao Zixiang, Mao Chunpu, Lu Yusheng, and Chen Jinrong was selected to travel to Nanjing on the 18th to petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other agencies. On the 24th, Chairman Chiang personally met with Xie Hengchuang, chairman of the industry association, after the Three Principles of the People Commemoration Week, and promised to instruct the Ministry of Economic Affairs to improve the coal allocation management methods. Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Dingwuyi will come to Shanghai on the 29th to discuss the aftermath.</p>
<p>According to Xie Hengchuang, chairman of the Shanghai Coal Industry Association, who just returned from petitioning in Nanjing yesterday: after the delegation arrived in Nanjing, they immediately visited the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Secretary Fan Jichang of the Executive Yuan received them on behalf of the Premier, and Minister Wang Lingwu of the Ministry of Economic Affairs personally received them, expressing acceptance of the coal industry's delegation's opinions and instructing them to provide further evidence of the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee's selling of allocated coal on the black market due to favoritism from December 1946 to mid-March 1947. The delegation then submitted five instances of the Fuel Management Committee's allocation of coal due to favoritism on the 20th, requesting investigation and handling. It is understood that the central government attaches great importance to this matter, and the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have dispatched investigators to Shanghai separately for a secret investigation.</p>
<p>Five Facts</p>
<p>The five instances of malfeasance by the Fuel Management Committee listed by the Coal Industry Association are: (1) Yongda Oil Factory, No. 21, Lane 475, Gaoyang Road, has been allocated 135 tons of coal twice, last December and this year. The Coal Industry Association learned from a confidential report that the factory uses diesel fuel. On March 4, personnel were sent to investigate the site and found 20 tons of coal stored inside. According to factory employee Li Songduan, 15 tons were borrowed and returned, and 20 tons were for personal use, but the legitimate use of the remaining coal could not be explained. They also "asked for help" from the investigators. This clearly involves favoritism and corruption. (2) Changxing Yarn Factory, No. 10, Rue Robert, was allocated 253 tons in December of this year and 300 tons this year, a total of 553 tons. Investigation revealed that the factory uses electricity and does not rely on coal as fuel. According to factory personnel, it is used for dyeing and printing. However, there are no dyeing and printing facilities inside the factory at No. 10 and No. 11 Rue Robert. This clearly involves favoritism and corruption. (3) The three companies shipping machinery and lumber, Sanhexing, Xiexingchang, and Hongxingchang, were allocated a total of 18 tons of coal this year. Separate investigations revealed that Sanhexing has not started work this year, Xiexingchang does not have coal-burning stoves, and Hongxingchang does not exist; the factory address is actually Yu Da Lumber. (4) No. 3, Lane 57, West Zhongzheng Road, was allocated coal without applying. (5) Hengfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory, No. 830, Ma Dang Road, was allocated 155 tons of coal at the end of last year and 210 tons of coal this year. Investigation revealed that the factory has four stoves, two using diesel, one using sesame cake, and only one burning coal. At most, coal usage accounts for one-fourth of the allocation, which is clearly favoritism and excessive allocation.</p>

Its tasks are: (1) Evaluating the prices of various important daily necessities; (2) Handling violations of agreed-upon prices, and dividing into six groups for preliminary discussions on rice, cooking oil, flour, cloth, sugar, and coal. In the future, price negotiations will be conducted separately by each group, and then submitted to the Director for approval before implementation. It is rumored that Director Wu will return to Shanghai from Nanjing today, and the first meeting of the committee will be held soon.</p>
<h3>Major Case of Gold Embezzlement: Investigating Tongfengyu's Account Books, District Court Refuses to Hand Them Over, Only Allows Review in a Designated Room in the Court</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The account books of Tongfengyu Gold Shop, which were allocated gold by the Central Bank in the Gold Rush Case, were transferred to the District Court by the Administrative Division of the Police Bureau the day before yesterday. He Qiji of the Ministry of Finance and Fan Shiyu of the Auditing Department visited the court again yesterday morning to request to inspect the books. The court president refused, because the case of Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, Zhan Yunsheng, and others colluding in embezzlement was ordered by Chairman Chiang and handled by the Garrison Command after arresting them and handing them over to the court. Before the trial is concluded, it is not appropriate to hand over the books. Moreover, the defendant in this case is the Central Bank, so it would be inappropriate to take the case files and account books to the Central Bank for review. However, as a compromise, the court can designate a special room for personnel from the Ministry of Finance and the Auditing Department to review the accounts, and the court is willing to send someone to assist. After this method was provided, He and Fan went there in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Furthermore, it is learned] Two lawyers for Zhan Liansheng visited Zhan at the detention center yesterday and reportedly informed him of the Ministry of Finance's dispatch of personnel for a thorough investigation and comforted Zhan greatly.</p>
<p>[Furthermore, it is learned] The court has assigned Judge Wang Jiazhuo to be responsible for handling the case, and the investigative hearing is scheduled for 3:00 PM on the 28th to summon relevant witnesses Feng Qing'an, Ni Zuguang, Xie Bingquan, Zhang Yuanbai, and others. Subpoenas have already been issued.</p>
<p>[Furthermore, it is reported] Auditor Fan of the Auditing Department returned to Nanjing yesterday and may return to Shanghai again today or tomorrow. Counselor He Qiji of the Ministry of Finance also returned to Nanjing last night and will return to Shanghai again tomorrow.</p>
<h3>"Haimin" Vessel Expected to Arrive This Afternoon: Sinking Ship Case to Be Handled Impartially</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Haimin" vessel, which collided with the "Fubo" warship in the sea off Guishan Island outside Xiamen, is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon and is scheduled to dock at buoys No. 8 and 9 on the Dongjiadu pier. It is understood that the left side of the bow of the ship was severely damaged and needs to be repaired after returning to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The "Haitian" vessel, which sailed to Calcutta, left India and returned to Shanghai last Friday. The "Haiti" vessel, which sailed to Guam, also departed from Guam last Saturday and returned to Shanghai. Both vessels have brought back a large number of surplus supplies.</p>
<p>[Additional report] According to a responsible person from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea have clear provisions that if two ships, A and B, meet at night, and ship B shows ship A a green sidelight on its starboard side, and ship A shows ship B a red sidelight on its port side, then ship B should be responsible for giving way to ship A, meaning ship B should turn its bow to the right to display a red light. Conversely, if ship A sees ship B displaying a green sidelight on its starboard side, then ship A should maintain its original heading. In this way, the red lights of ships A and B illuminate each other, and they meet in parallel, so there is no danger of collision. When the "Haimin" and "Fubo" met at night, the "Haimin" displayed a red light on its port side, and the "Fubo" displayed a green light on its starboard side, so the "Fubo" should have the responsibility to give way, and the "Haimin" should have maintained its original heading. If the "Fubo" warship had turned its bow to the right, displaying a red light to the "Haimin," then the red lights would illuminate each other, and they would pass in parallel, which would not have caused a major disaster. As for the issue of responsibility for this unfortunate incident, after the "Haimin" arrives in Shanghai, the joint investigation committee organized by the Naval Headquarters, the Ministry of Communications, and several nautical experts will handle the matter impartially.</p>

<h3>Starting Point for Salary Discounts in the Commercial Press: Labor and Management Still Need to Continue Discussions</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The salaries of the Commercial Press employees used to be calculated in various ways, such as rice subsidies and calculations based on self-compiled cost of living indices. Recently, it was requested that all be changed to calculations based on the cost of living index announced by the Municipal Government to determine the base salary, ranging from 44 yuan to 600 yuan. However, the two sides are in disagreement over the starting point for discounting the base salary. The employees once implemented a "work stoppage," suspending business, and resumed work only after persuasion from the Bureau of Social Affairs. The bureau convened both parties for negotiations again the night before last. The employer stated that those with a base salary of 55 yuan or less would be paid in full, those exceeding 55 yuan to 200 yuan would have their excess portion discounted by 20%, and those exceeding 200 yuan would have their excess portion discounted by 10%. Those below 55 yuan whose income is less than before due to calculation based on the Municipal Government's cost of living index may be subsidized. The labor side is still dissatisfied with the 55 yuan discount starting point, and both parties still need to continue discussions.</p>
<h3>Failure to Resolve at Yuehua Factory; Labor-Management Compromise at Rongmao Factory</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A dispute arose at the Yuehua Tobacco Factory earlier due to the February pay differential and the dismissal of two female workers, Zhang Meie and Pan Zizhen. More than fifty workers had previously petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, but without success. Yesterday afternoon, 450 employees of the factory gathered again to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. It is said that the employees' salaries are supposed to be paid in two installments on the 5th and 20th of each month, but the salary for the 20th of this month has not yet been paid. The February pay differential has also not been paid according to regulations. Zhang and Pan were dismissed because they represented the employees in negotiations with the management regarding the pay differential issue. However, according to the factory, the two workers were dismissed for dereliction of duty due to errors in affixing commodity tax stamps. The matter is currently being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau. Employees of the Rongmao Sawmill at 1998 Changning Road requested the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate the adjustment of wages. Now, both labor and management have agreed to implement the wages and working hours stipulated in the written record signed by the Shanghai Business Rongtong Rong Association and the Machine Saw This Collection Labor Union on October 30, 1946, effective immediately.</p>
<h3>Foreign Expert from China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Discusses Improving the Current State of Civil Aviation; Avoiding Flight Accidents Hinges on Special Care; Exhaustion Must Be Corrected</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Mr. Bond, a foreign expert from the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), arrived in China from the United States at the end of last month to oversee improvements to the current state of civil aviation. Bond is one of the founding pioneers of CNAC and has served for 16 years. He came to China in 1931 and initially worked for Pan American Airways. The following year, Pan American Airways jointly established CNAC with the Chinese government, and Bond was transferred to be the director of the flight operations department. In recent years, he retired and served as a senior consultant. Last September, due to poor health, he took a six-month leave of absence to recuperate in the United States. He returned to China ahead of schedule due to frequent aircraft accidents, hoping to find ways to improve the situation. Ellison, the newly appointed director of flight operations, also came along and was a pilot during the early days of CNAC.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter visited both of them and asked how they would proceed. Bond believes that after reviewing previous aircraft accidents, while some were due to poor equipment, the main cause was carelessness. He believes that after World War II, people around the world generally experience mental exhaustion. The recent aircraft accidents around the world may be due to the lax and uneasy state caused by this psychological condition. The global aviation industry is still in its infancy, and China's is particularly nascent, so one must never stop at the slightest setback. Of course, every effort must be made to prevent aircraft accidents in the future. Given the current state of equipment, which cannot be improved immediately due to various objective factors, the only effective method is to exercise special caution. Special caution includes meticulous inspection of machinery, responsible ground staff, avoidance of severe weather, and careful piloting by pilots. If these are followed, it is believed that flight accidents can be minimized. He also used the analogy of a child learning to walk, where stumbles are inevitable, but eventually, they will grow stronger.</p>
<h3>Songhu Garrison Command Directly Under the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command received an order from the Ministry of National Defense the day before yesterday stating, "From the date of receipt, the Songhu Garrison Command will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense, and the defense zone will remain unchanged." Nominally, the command was originally subordinate to the Capital Garrison Command, but this change was made to simplify the handling of official documents.</p>
<h3>Raising and Lowering the National Flag with Music; Yuan Specifies Sheet Music</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government recently received instructions from the Executive Yuan, specifying the sheet music to be played when raising and lowering the national flag as follows: All military, government, and educational institutions, as well as people's organizations, should play the "Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth" song when raising and lowering the flag before the central government creates new music, to show respect. Overseas embassies and consulates, and naval fleets, may also refer to this for raising and lowering the flag. It is reported that the Municipal Government has already complied and has notified all subordinate bureaus accordingly.</p>

<h3>Fake District Court President Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The case of Sun Shaokang, the former president of the fake Shanghai District Court, suspected of being a traitor, was sentenced by the High Court yesterday morning. Sun Shaokang was found guilty of conspiring with the enemy to resist our country and was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, with deprivation of civil rights for three years. His property was confiscated, except for what was deemed necessary to provide his family with living expenses. Sun was from Jilin and was 62 years old. Before the war, he served as the chief prosecutor of the Capital High Court and the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court.

<h3>The Case of Two Monks from Jing'an Temple Accused of Collaboration with the Enemy; The Dersimi Trial Concluded Yesterday; Denied All Charges and Argued No Connection with the Dōbō School</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The case of Degu, the abbot of Jing'an Temple, and Miga, the supervisor, suspected of being traitors, concluded at the High Court yesterday morning and is scheduled for sentencing on April 1st. Degu is 28 years old and from Shanghai. Miga is 37 years old and from Ningbo. They were reported by Liugen, the former abbot of Jing'an Temple, Yangxi, the former supervisor, and Xie Xiqing. The defendants' crimes include co-founding the Dōbō Japanese Language School with the Japanese Higashi Honganji Temple, participating in the Fake Buddhist Association and serving as an executive director, holding the Vajra Puli Dharma Assembly, the Greater East Asia Memorial Service, the Jing'an Temple Protector Association, and welcoming the Japanese monks Yūmatsu and Kuramochi. When the trial opened yesterday, the audience was filled with monks who were extremely concerned. The trial lasted for three hours, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The defendants argued that the Fake Shanghai Special City Buddhist Association was a religious organization formed by various temples in Shanghai. The abbots or chief officers of all major temples in the city were naturally directors or executive directors. Its purpose was to promote charitable and relief activities externally and to promote Buddhism and rectify religious rules internally, with no political, economic, or military significance whatsoever. The Dōbō Japanese Language School was forcibly borrowing two classrooms from Jing'an Elementary School for night classes. Its principal was the monk Kinoshita Bankei from Higashi Honganji Temple, and all personnel and expenses were completely unrelated to Jing'an Temple. The recruitment advertisement and wooden sign photograph of the "Buddhist Dōbō Japanese Language School" submitted by the plaintiff were forged. The Vajra Puli Dharma Assembly was held at Jing'an Temple by representatives of the Panchen Lama from Tibet. The president of the Jing'an Temple Protector Association was Li Sihao, and its purpose was purely to promote Buddhist principles, rectify religious rules, maintain temple property, and conduct public welfare activities, a Buddhist organization for Buddhist believers, with no other function. The Greater East Asia Memorial Service was hosted by the Greater East Asia Buddhist Association and held at the Jade Buddha Temple. Welcoming the Japanese monks Yūmatsu and Kuramochi to China was due to pressure from the Fake Shanghai Special City Buddhist Association and was purely a matter of etiquette. They had no further relationship with Yūmatsu and Kuramochi. After the defendant completed his statement, prosecutor Sun Xiangrong stood up and requested the court to handle the case according to law. After the defense attorneys Mi Xitong, Zhou Xiaoan, and Xi Shichang stood up and made their arguments, the presiding judge concluded that the debate in this case was over and set April 1st for sentencing.</p>
<h3>The Case of Huang Bohui's Attempted Assassination; The Identity of the Assassin Remains a Question; The District Attorney's Office Believes There is Insufficient Evidence Against Zheng Desheng and Others</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In the case of Huang Bohui, the former owner of the Shibao, being "assassinated," according to Huang's account, at approximately 10:00 PM on February 18th of this year, he returned to his residence at 179 Hubei Road, Fuhu Building, and found the main door wide open. He climbed the stairs and, upon reaching the second-floor landing, saw two women who looked at him and then hurried back to the third floor. At the same time, two Westerners wearing casual hats and yellow coats suddenly appeared at the entrance of the third floor, approached the corner of the staircase between the third and fourth floors, and stopped him from proceeding. When questioned, the two Westerners said, "This is the man we're looking for." One of them forcibly grabbed both of his arms, and the other Westerner on the right shot him in the forehead with a gun. He fell to the ground in extreme pain but remained conscious. He felt one of the Westerners holding his head and neck with his foot to prevent him from moving. Fearing another shot, he shouted, "I am a friend of President Roosevelt!" The two Westerners released him upon hearing this. After the assailants had gone far, he struggled to climb to Room 411 on the fourth floor, where a friend took him to Renji Hospital for treatment. He claimed that Zheng Desheng, the renter of his property, harbored ill will due to a housing dispute and other debts and incited his American friend, Hess Wett, to commit murder. His wife, Zheng Pu, and daughter, Zheng Jingyan, also assisted in the conspiracy. After a thorough investigation lasting over a month by District Attorney Cao Hong, the District Attorney's Office concluded that there was insufficient evidence against the defendants Zheng Desheng, Zou Pu, Zheng Jingyan, and Hess Wett, and ordered a non-prosecution. District Attorney Cao explained the non-prosecution in three parts: (1) Regarding Zheng Desheng, Zheng Pu, and Zheng Jingyan, although it was found that Huang Bohui and Zheng Desheng had a grudge due to a housing dispute and other debts, the two parties had already entrusted lawyers to mediate, and with civil debt relations, why would Zheng Desheng resort to such a reckless measure and fall into the trap of the law? Although Hess Wett and Zheng Desheng were acquainted, they were not close friends. How could he entrust him with the serious task of murder? For Hess Wett, the relationship was not close enough to risk his life, and the punishment was severe. No one is foolish enough to take such a great risk and voluntarily subject himself to criminal detention. (2) Regarding Hess Wett, he was a second mate on the Wan Jian, a ship of the General Transport Water Transport Team, and met Zheng on a trip. They were not close friends to begin with, and he had no grudges with Huang Bohui at all. Moreover, fellow ship employees proved that Hess did not leave the ship that night. (3) The results of the on-site investigation revealed that not only were there no bullet casings, but there were also no bullet marks on the walls or within the range and angle of the gunshots. The blood splatters on the corner of the wall between the third and fourth floors were all pointed upwards, indicating that the blood had dripped onto the ground and splashed up, or that the blood on the ground had splashed due to pressure. If the injury had occurred on top of his head while he was standing, the blood splatters would have pointed downwards. Moreover, Huang's head wound was arc-shaped, further proving that it was not caused by a gunshot. At the same time, all residents of the third and fourth floors of the Fuhu Building stated that they did not hear any gunshots. Therefore, the accusations made by Huang Bohui against the defendants Zheng Desheng and others should be dismissed in accordance with Article 231, Paragraph 10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The defendant Zheng Desheng, who is currently in custody in this case, will not be released until the disposition is finalized.</p>
<h3>A Trivial Dispute; A Blacksmith Beats His Wife to Death</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yin Huakun, 34 years old, a blacksmith from Changzhou living at No. 495, Lane 972, Xikang Road, Shanghai West, was married to his wife, Ms. Ma, 27 years old, for ten years and had a ten-year-old daughter. The couple had a good relationship on weekdays. Yesterday morning, around 7:00 AM, after Yin Huakun got up, he planned to go to Zhabei to work and urged Ms. Ma to quickly cook breakfast. Because she complained slightly, the two had a dispute, and Yin beat Ms. Ma. Ms. Ma fell to the ground, unconscious. Yin left home. Later, her cousin, Chao Hongsheng (living in the same lane), rushed over after hearing the news and hired a car to accompany his cousin to the Municipal Third Hospital for treatment, but she had already died upon arrival. Someone reported the case to the Putuo Road Police Station. Section Chief Zhu Dingkun ordered officers Zhang Xiaolin, Zhao Yongji, and others to rush to the hospital and residence to investigate the truth and left several plainclothes officers to guard the house. Around 9:00 AM, Ma Shang, who did not know that Ms. Ma had been beaten to death, hurriedly returned home and was arrested by the officers and taken to the bureau for questioning, where he confessed to the beating. He is scheduled to be handed over to the judiciary for trial this morning.</p>
<h3>A Cobbler's Wife Actually Wears a Diamond Ring; Theft Exposed on Guling Road; All Perpetrators Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Wang Zhongqi, a securities businessman residing at 152 Guling Road, heard footsteps on the staircase around 4:00 AM on the 17th. He shouted to ask who it was, and someone replied, "It's me." Knowing that something was wrong, he immediately got out of bed and went downstairs to investigate. He discovered that the front and back doors were wide open, the drawers of the chest of drawers in the room were open, and the keys in the coat pocket hanging on the clothes rack were also missing. He hurriedly chased out of the lane to search, but they were already gone. He then filed a loss report, including two diamond rings, one weighing over three carats and ten points, and the other weighing one carat and sixty points, five gold bracelets, three gold rings, a ruby ring and a ruby ring, a gold ingot, three small gold bars, a pair of emerald ruby earrings, a gold pocket watch and a gold watch, over a thousand silver coins, and many other silver chopsticks and silverware.</p>
<p>Section Chief Ding Zhenduo of the police station in charge ordered officers Weng Yongquan, Gu Zhuobin, and Fang Shengwu to rush to the scene to investigate, but initially found nothing. Later, a discarded empty drawer from Wang's chest of drawers was found next to a garbage can in Lane 161 on Beijing West Road, indicating that the thief must have lived in this lane. Investigation revealed that Zhou Houjie, a cobbler who set up a stall at the entrance of the lane, was suspected. At the same time, it was discovered that his wife, Zhao, was wearing a diamond ring, leading to the conclusion that she was undoubtedly involved in the theft. Further investigation revealed that Gu Ada, a worker at the Xiexing Printing Factory at 169 Tonglu, was in close contact with Zhou and had recently sold gold rings and other jewelry. Gu Ada, Zhou, and Zhao were all brought to the bureau for questioning, but they all denied everything. Later, it was rumored that Zhao had taken a three-carat diamond ring to Wang Yu's residence at No. 5 Changshou Lane, Beijing West Road, to sell it, but Wang refused to accept it because the price was too low (3 million yuan). Wang was summoned to the bureau for questioning and confirmed the story. When confronted with Wang's testimony, Zhou remained silent and admitted everything. He also confessed that his husband, Zhou Junjie, along with Peng Zhenlin and Gu Ada, had placed the diamond rings and other jewelry in a drawer and brought it back from outside, but he did not know where they had stolen them from. At this time, Zhou also confessed. The police then took him to his house and recovered part of the stolen goods from under the floor and on the mezzanine. At No. 204 Yongle Lane, Shandong Road, Peng Zhenlin's home was searched, but he was not found. Until 9:00 AM yesterday, Peng voluntarily surrendered to the police station. All the perpetrators are scheduled to be handed over to the District Attorney's Office for further investigation in the coming days.</p>
<h3>A Den of Thieves by the Nine-Bend Bridge; Recovered Loot Piled High; The Hubei Gang Leader Arrested</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] On the 23rd of this month, the Yixian Police Station solved three major and minor theft cases, one robbery case, and one drug trafficking and drug use case. Except for the drug traffickers and drug users Dong Geng and Yang Wang, who have been sent to the District Attorney's Office, the investigation of the remaining cases was completed only last night, and the recovered stolen goods exceeded 10 million yuan. Among those arrested was the notorious Hubei gang active in the French Concession, Pengmei, and Yimiao areas. Six key members, including Zhang Yulin, Chen Lingen, Zhu Na'an, Wu Shaonan, Zhou Shousheng, and Huang Guangxue, have all been apprehended.</p>
<p>Yimiao Branch Bureau Chief Shen Tangheng received a tip-off on the 23rd stating that a large number of well-known thieves were hiding in the shantytowns near the Nine-Bend Bridge in the City God Temple. That morning, he dispatched Section Chief Zhou Nan to lead officers Gen Shen and Sun Ziqiang to search the area. As a result, six bags of brown sugar (approximately 1,300 catties), four barrels and three boxes of e-liao, three sewing machine heads, and seventeen bolts of cloth, totaling over 100 million yuan, were found in the shantytowns. All those involved were taken to the bureau for questioning. After individual interrogations, it was discovered that Zhang Yulin and the six other leaders of the notorious Hubei gang were among them. After two days and nights of investigation, it was learned that the above-mentioned goods were stolen from No. 1 Danfeng Road, Xiyi Lane, No. 406 Fangbang Road, No. 139 Middle Zheng East Road, No. 2, Lane 45 Jishan Temple Street, and the Qujia Lane Jinxian Elementary School.

<h3>Former US Military Liaison Group Personnel in Taiwan; Embezzlement of Gold Case; Non-Prosecution; Eighteen People Who Purchased the Loot Also Not Prosecuted Due to Amnesty</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The case of Lieutenant Colonel Evans, the former head of the US Military Liaison Group in Taiwan, embezzling 60 kilograms of gold from the Japanese military in Taiwan that should have been handed over to the Chinese government and selling it in the Shanghai night market for profit, was previously ordered to be investigated by the Shanghai District Attorney's Office by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. District Attorney Liu Yongzhi concluded the investigation with a non-prosecution ruling due to improper jurisdiction. According to the case file, the gold was originally intended to be shipped by the Japanese Army Ministry to supply the Japanese military in the Philippines. Due to air transport difficulties at the time, it landed in Taiwan and could not be transported further. Therefore, it was kept in custody by the Japanese military in Taiwan. After Lieutenant Colonel Evans learned of the batch of gold, he extracted it from Major Harada, a staff officer of the Japanese military post-war liaison department, in five separate occasions. Only on November 1, 1945, the second extraction of 60 kilograms of gold was divided into four wooden boxes and taken to the Taiwan Provincial Government by Harada for receipt by Secretary-General Ge Jingen. Later, the military law department of the Taiwan Garrison Command inquired with Harada, who claimed that except for the second shipment, which was directly handed over to the government, Evans personally drove a jeep to pick up the other shipments and opened the boxes on the spot, putting the gold bars into a red briefcase and taking them away.</p>
<p>Headquarters of the US Military in China</p>
<p>Sent personnel to Taiwan in May 1946 to investigate the case. In June of the same year, Huang Zaiyi, a Taiwanese businessman who handled the sale of the batch of gold entrusted by Evans, was arrested in Shanghai. According to Huang's confession, Evans came to Shanghai twice in November and December 1945 and entrusted him with the sale of 1,921 gold bars (one tael each). More than 300 of them were sold by Captain Elon Sheng, obtaining a total of US$100,000 and US$8,000. Huang Zaiyi received a referral fee of US$850. Based on Huang Zaiyi's confession, the Criminal Investigation Group of the US Military Headquarters in China recovered 1,921 original gold bars from 14 money shops and businesses in Shanghai, including Dasen and Xietai. The gold bars were engraved with the character "Fu" on the front and "24K/1000" on the back, which was completely identical to the newly received ones by the government. Therefore, the crime of embezzlement</p>
<p>seems to be confirmed</p>
<p>However, Captain Elon Sheng is an active US military officer and should be tried by a US military court according to law. Lieutenant Colonel Evans has now retired but does not have the status of a Chinese military officer or a public servant of our government. Therefore, he cannot be punished under the Anti-Corruption Statute and can only be charged with the crime of embezzlement of public funds under Article 336, Paragraph 1 of the ordinary criminal law. However, his crime occurred before December 31, 1946, and the highest principal sentence is no more than seven years of imprisonment, which meets the amnesty provisions under item A of the amnesty decree. Furthermore, Evans and Elon Sheng are far away in the United States; and there is no extradition treaty between China and the United States.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is still appropriate to transfer the case to the US government for its own legal decision. As for the civil compensation liability, a reasonable solution can be sought in the future through civil proceedings. Therefore, a non-prosecution ruling was issued in accordance with Article 231, Paragraph 7, Subparagraph 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As for the part of purchasing stolen goods, the defendants Huang Zaiyi, Sun Xian, Jiang Shengtang, Jue Zongyu, Cheng Jushi, Li Zhicheng, Yang Zhichang, Xu Henian, Wang Shouzheng, Ji Jiehe, Wang Kewen, Chen Yunxi, Zhu Jinchun, Hu Yuji, Zhu Jialin, Gu Yuhong, Zhuang Shanbing, and Shi Xianglong, were also not prosecuted due to the amnesty.</p>

<h3>How to Determine the In-and-Out Price of Gold Jewelry? Silverware Industry Asks the Social Bureau for Instructions Today's Meeting to Designate a Calculation Table After the Economic and Social Bureau Decides, the Industry Will Resume</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Yao Lianfang, Yao Guiqing, Wu Pengnian, Chen Dezhang, and Biao Yunliang, representatives of the silverware industry in this city, visited Mayor Wu at the City Hall at around 11 a.m. yesterday, bringing a written presentation. Mayor Wu responded that the points raised were under the jurisdiction of the City Social Bureau, and instructed them to consult with the bureau. The representatives then went to the City Social Bureau at 3 p.m. Director Wu was away on business in Beijing, so Shao, the Section Chief of the Second Section of the bureau, received them. The representatives presented a written document, the main points of which were: (1) The selling price should be determined by public consultation and reported to the Social Bureau for record, in order to simplify the process. (2) If supply and demand cannot be met, customers should not be allowed to force purchases or exchanges, and the silverware industry should be allowed to request protection at any time to avoid disputes. (3) Redemption should be based on the Central Bank's price of 480,000 yuan. If supply and demand are unbalanced, the industry should consider providing a labor cost allowance to customers whose jewelry is in good condition, in order to reduce customer losses and maintain the industry's consistent reputation. (4) Before the Central Bank allocates supply, the industry relies solely on store sales and redemptions, which are difficult to balance. In order to make up for shortages and surpluses, businesses should be allowed to supply each other, with a slight handling fee, to avoid the emergence of a black market. Social Bureau Section Chief Shao stated that the Ministry of Finance's new management measures had only been seen in newspapers, and the Social Bureau had not yet received formal instructions. He would forward the representatives' requests to Director Wu and ask for instructions.</p>
<p>According to the representatives, a meeting will be held today to determine the price calculation table for selling gold jewelry. The table includes various items, with each tael priced at 480,000 yuan according to the Central Bank's price, plus a profit, interest, labor cost, and other expenses of 100,000 yuan. Once the table is determined, it will be submitted to the Social Bureau today. As soon as a definitive reply is received, business will resume. Representatives from Tianjin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hubei and other regions are also waiting for news in Shanghai and will take the same steps as the Shanghai market.</p>
<h3>If Raw Material Problems Cannot Be Resolved, the Future of the Match Industry is Bleak</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] According to a survey by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office: there are a total of 24 members of the Match Industry Association in this city, (of which the Samsung Match Factory has withdrawn from the association due to poor business), the current total output of match factories in this city is about 13,000 cases per month (including the Da Zhonghua Shanghai Yingchang Factory, excluding branches, and including Mei Kwong). If full capacity is utilized, it can reach 19,000 cases. The current output of general factories is only about three-fifths of full capacity. The 24 factories have a total of 2,762 workers and 136 plank carts. According to the survey: the manufacturing cost of matches is similar for both large and small factories, while the selling price differs significantly. Large factories sell each case for 1.5 million yuan, while small factories sell for 500,000 yuan. Therefore, joint operation is advisable to protect the survival of small factories. The raw materials for matches, such as potassium chlorate and zinc oxide, are not sufficient domestically and are largely dependent on foreign goods. Oxhide glue can be largely supplied by the Chichang New Glue Factory in this city. Cotton poplar comes partly from Qingdao, but most is still dependent on imports. Other raw materials, such as red phosphorus, white wax, red alum, and sulfur, all rely on imports. Therefore, if the raw material problems are not resolved, the match industry in this city has no significant meaning to speak of. Those who operate match factories should first find ways to manufacture potassium chlorate, red phosphorus, and cotton poplar themselves, in order to establish the foundation of China's match industry. Currently, the only solution is to relax the supply of foreign exchange in order to maintain the status quo. The office also believes that the current counterfeit matches in this city are extremely rampant. These goods are of poor quality and harm the business of legitimate factories. The industry hopes that the government will prohibit them. The industry also believes that matches are daily necessities, and a tax of 20% seems too high. They plan to ask the government to reduce the tax to benefit business.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Silverware Industry Asks for Lenient Treatment on Prohibition of Gold Bullion Redemption</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Nanjing, 25th special dispatch] Yan Chunrong, chairman of the Nanjing Silverware Industry Association, said that the industry was originally scheduled to resume business uniformly today, but during a resumption symposium held yesterday afternoon, some members believed that Article 5 of the "Management Measures for the Redemption and Manufacturing of Gold Jewelry by the Silverware Industry" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, which stipulates that the silverware industry shall not redeem gold bullion, would further cut off the supply of raw gold. They requested that the competent authorities interpret the regulation and ask for lenient treatment. Therefore, this morning, except for a few stores such as Lao Tian Dou on Zhonghua Road in Nanjing, which had already started business, the rest continued to suspend operations. This morning at 11 o'clock, the industry sent four representatives, including Yan Chunrong, to the Social Bureau to petition, requesting that the prohibition of gold redemption by the silverware industry be relaxed. Because the bureau had no power to change government laws and regulations, it agreed to convey the industry's difficulties to the government authorities.</p>
<h3>Export Groups Hold Separate Meetings</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The textile, knitwear, and cotton groups of the Export Promotion Council held their first meeting at the Textile Construction Company at 2 p.m. yesterday. Yang Xiren, Wu Weijing, Guo Dihuo, Wang Yangxian, and Zhang Silu attended. Several issues were discussed: (1) The current difference between the buying and selling price of British pound exchange rate at the Central Bank is 8,000 yuan. This is very disadvantageous for cotton textiles exported to the British pound group. It is proposed that the maximum difference between the buying and selling price of the British pound exchange rate should not exceed 5%. (2) The export of Chinese cotton yarn is currently being negotiated and promoted in Rangoon, Saigon, and Siam. In Hong Kong, the second batch of cotton yarn requires 32-count and 42-count fine yarn, so the export will be delayed until the beginning of next month. (3) The current market price of cotton yarn in this city is balanced, so the export volume of cotton yarn from this city will generally expand to one-tenth of the total production each month.</p>
<p>The straw hat whip and straw hat group also held their first meeting at the Central Trust Bureau at 3 p.m. yesterday. Shen Xirui, Feng Jimin, Yu Langxi, Lin Jinfu, Sun Deyou, and Yuan Jialin attended. The following issues were discussed: (1) It is hoped that the customs can facilitate the import of raw materials for straw hat whips, and the government can provide subsidies in terms of collecting export taxes in the future. (2) It is hoped that loan funds for the industry can be directly lent to manufacturers.</p>
<p>The opinions discussed at the recent meetings of various groups will be submitted to the Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Council, which will be held this Thursday, for discussion and final decision.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market turned stable again. There was a slight demand from Jiangxi merchants. Industry insiders had firm intentions due to increased costs. Although Tianjin and Guangdong merchants were watching and not moving, there were still those who bought at low prices, so the price rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Lingering on a Weak Path</h3>
<p>The foreign tea market has remained weak. Generally, cargo owners are keen to sell their current stock in light of new tea from this year about to come into production, resulting in an abundance of existing product. Although buyers are taking advantage of the low prices, it is still a buyer's market. Prices are unlikely to rise. Yesterday, 同孚 foreign firm bought more than 100 cases of 卅四年份　源抽珍 at a price as low as 550,000 yuan per dan. Other grades, such as Zhen Mei and needle 届, were purchased by 大德昌 and 午昌 tea companies, with prices on a downward trend. As for red and green tea for domestic sales, the situation is quiet and unremarkable.</p>

(2) The raw materials needed for spinning construction spindles will be calculated at 60 pence. (3) Shanghai Wool, Anle, Zhenfeng, and other factories have proposed that a large amount of raw materials are needed for woolen yarn and coarse spinning spindles. It has been decided that the standards set by the association are actually far from sufficient and should be corrected. Resolution: Still according to the original plan, but it should be explained in detail when reporting. (4) The wool raw material quota for this industry from February to April is only 1.4 million US dollars, which is too small. According to actual needs, it is only 15% of the required amount. It is proposed to request the allocation office to find other ways to meet the foreign exchange needs of state-owned factories, not within the above-mentioned scope, in order to solve the immediate crisis and maintain work. (5) The industry needs about 3.5 million US dollars in foreign exchange per month. Currently, there are only more than 400,000 US dollars. It is impossible to cook without rice. A way must be found. The Import Management Committee should be asked to relax the scale in order to be responsible for the situation.</p>
<h3>Three Associations Resubmit to the Executive Yuan to Request the Return of Robbed Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>The movement to recover the robbed yarn and cloth launched by the three trade associations of dyeing and weaving factories, cotton cloth shops, and cotton yarn shops has lasted for a year and a half. In the end, it was rejected after initially being approved due to the Executive Yuan's concept of financial relief. The three associations then filed an administrative lawsuit, but it did not yield any results. Since the departure of Mr. Song and the concurrent appointment of Chairman Chiang as the head of the Executive Yuan, society has been refreshed. The three industries have held several meetings to discuss and decided to prepare a document and resubmit it to the Executive Yuan to make an earnest appeal. According to the spokesperson of the three associations: Since the opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the central government has repeatedly stated that the priority should be to restore national credibility. Whether this case can be resolved fairly will also be a testament to whether national credibility can be re-established.</p>
<h3>Dyes Turn from Bad to Good, Sulfide Prices Rise</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The dye market, which has been flat for a long time, saw active sales yesterday. MK sulfide cost 5 million yuan per unit, and 693 sulfide cost 6.5 million yuan per dan, up 500,000 yuan from the previous week. The prices of other dyes remained the same, but the prices were fairly firm.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Company Reports on the Work in 1946</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The Textile Construction Company yesterday released a report on its work in 1946, stating briefly: Since the company was formally established on December 4, 1945, it was ordered to take over enemy-owned textile factories in China. The head office began operating in Shanghai on November 2, 1946, and the Tianjin and Qingdao branch offices were also established at the beginning of January. In addition, in order to facilitate cotton collection and sales, offices were established in Chongqing, Xi'an, Shashi, Hankou, Guangzhou, Nantong, Hangzhou, Shantou, and Zhengzhou. In August, the Northeast branch office and various offices were added. Regarding industrial affairs, after actively engaging in reorganization, the company currently has 18 cotton textile factories, 6 printing and dyeing factories, 5 woolen mills, 2 hemp manufacturing and machinery factories, and 1 silk spinning, yarn tape, and knitting factory each in Shanghai. Tianjin currently has 7 cotton textile factories, and 1 machinery silk weaving, woolen mill, hemp spinning, and printing and dyeing factory each. Qingdao has 8 cotton textile factories, and 1 machinery, spool, printing, bleaching, knitting, and textile-related chemical factory each. The Northeast currently has 5 cotton textile and printing and dyeing factories each. In total, there are 1,758,480 yarn spindles, 330,256 thread spindles, and 28,591 looms. The Northeast Dalian and Jinzhou are still being taken over and are not included. As for the production process, the manufacturing cost is 20% lower than that of private factories. At the same time, the average output per yarn spindle is 0.989, which has reached the pre-war standard. Regarding business strategy, an agreement has recently been reached with the Hong Kong government to supply cotton yarn worth 2 million pounds. In addition, negotiations are also underway with Vietnam, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, and other regions. If one-tenth of the annual production can be exported, there may not be any problems with domestic supply. In the coming year, it is estimated that foreign exchange of 75 million to 100 million US dollars can be earned to offset the country's trade deficit. In 1946, the company applied for more than 26,079,000 US dollars in foreign exchange and ordered more than 804,000 dan of foreign cotton (more than 162,000 dan have not been received). For the cotton needed in 1947, more than 900,000 dan of domestic cotton have been purchased by the end of last year, and another 300,000 dan will be purchased. The insufficient amount will be supplemented by foreign cotton. In terms of finance, the government allocated 1 billion yuan in initial capital and 5 billion yuan in working capital, and the value of the enemy-owned raw materials taken over was estimated at 19.5 billion yuan. After painstaking management, not only were the debts to banks and the head office cleared, but also 80 billion yuan was paid to the national treasury, and more than 100 billion yuan in unrecorded military yarn and cloth. The total net profit was more than 577.6 billion yuan, including depreciation reserves and the stored raw cotton, wool, dyes, and finished products. If estimated at the current market value, the total net profit would be around 1 trillion yuan.</p>

<h3>The Cradle of the Chinese Navy: A Visit to Mawei</h3>
<p>— Fuzhou Dispatch, 18th. Special Correspondent Chen Zheng Yu</p>
<p>Mawei—the birthplace of the Chinese navy, has an inseparable relationship with the history of the Chinese navy. Tracing back to the fifth year of the Tongzhi reign (1866), the Qing court, awed by the powerful ships and cannons of foreigners, initiated the Westernization Movement. Governor-General of Zhejiang and Fujian, Zuo Zongtang, proposed establishing a naval shipyard in Mawei, Fuzhou. The Qing court approved, and the following year, ordered Jiangxi Governor Shen Baozhen to Fujian to oversee and plan everything, writing the first chapter of the Chinese naval history. China, a country with over nine thousand miles of coastline, needs a navy for its establishment. Mentioning the Chinese navy inevitably brings to mind Mawei, nestled on the northern bank of the Min River estuary. Despite being a small town, it boasts a glorious history.</p>
<p>The Gateway to Fujian: A Strategically Important Area</p>
<p>Mawei is located 25 kilometers southeast of Fuzhou, protruding into the Min River, serving as the gateway to Fuzhou. Surrounded by mountains outside the harbor, it forms a natural barrier. Inside the harbor, the water is deep and the waves are calm, making it convenient for ships to dock. The Luoxing Pagoda stands in the middle of the stream, indeed controlling the strategic location. All sea transport heading to Fuzhou moors here, and then smaller boats transport goods to the city, making it the outer port of the provincial capital.</p>
<p>From a military perspective, below Mawei, mountains flank both sides, narrowing the river passage, with the Min'an Gate guarding the front, creating a natural defense. Holding this corner is sufficient to defend the provincial capital and eastern Fujian, truly a strategic area for maritime defense. Moreover, Mawei Port has deep waters and solid ground, with winding harbors suitable for naval training. The Chinese navy's origin in Mawei is indeed based on its geographical advantages.</p>
<p>Training Soldiers and Building Ships: A Time of Great Prosperity</p>
<p>Mawei was originally a desolate village, but later prospered following the development of the Chinese navy. Houses lined up closely, with a dense population, resembling a small city. From the fifth year of the Tongzhi reign to the 26th year of the Republic of China (1866-1937), Mawei had become a central hub of naval activity for eighty years. Since Shen Baozhen managed naval affairs, Mawei established a shipyard and a naval academy, with the front academy specializing in navigation technology and the rear academy specializing in marine engines. Naval veterans such as Sa Zhenbing and Yang Shuzhuang graduated from here, nurturing many talents for the initial construction of the Chinese navy. After the founding of the Republic of China, the front and rear academies were renamed Naval Academy, and schools for flying submarines, an arts academy, an aircraft manufacturing plant, an ammunition factory, and training camps were established. Defense organizations such as the Kejing Weiying, Xunfang Ying, Shuishi Ying, the port headquarters, coastal defense marine corps, and the Min River Estuary Defense Headquarters were stationed here successively. The shipyard at its peak had thirteen factories, employing over 4,500 workers. The scale was vast, and the equipment was complete, capable of building small warships, gunboats, transport ships, and various types of shells. The buildings were magnificent and imposing, lined up closely, resembling a naval stronghold. It was once extremely prosperous.</p>
<p>Naval Training Camp: The Only Surviving Remnant</p>
<p>Mawei presents a desolate scene after the baptism of artillery fire. The naval shipyard has been shut down, and the river defense agencies have also been dismantled. Only personnel from the Naval Headquarters Custodial Group remain to preserve the remaining equipment and ammunition that cannot be easily moved. The Naval Academy moved west to Guiyang in the early stages of the War of Resistance and has now relocated to Shanghai, renamed the Central Naval Officer School. The only surviving remnant is the Naval Second Training Camp. The training camp was originally renamed from the Lianyong School in the late Qing Dynasty and moved to Mawei from Lushunkou in the 15th year of the Republic of China (1926). Founded over fifty years ago, it has cultivated many cadres for the navy. Today, the majority of naval officers are graduates of the Mawei Naval Academy and the Training Camp. When Fuzhou fell, the camp retreated to Meilie in Sanyuan County, and last year it moved back to Mawei to repair the barracks and was ordered to expand. In September of the same year, the Naval Headquarters added the First and Third Training Camps, located in Jiangyin and Fuxing Island, Shanghai, respectively. The one in Mawei was renamed the Second Training Camp.</p>
<p>Recruiting Youths to Defend the Seas</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived at the Naval Second Training Camp, Camp Commander Colonel Ye Keyu greeted and led the tour. The camp covers an area of over fifty acres, with ample space, situated against the mountain and facing the water, in a commanding position. The grounds are planted with flowers and trees, verdant and fragrant, refreshing the mind. The American-style barracks stand high on the mountain, overlooking the clear stream, with picturesque scenery. There are currently over a thousand trainees and 130 officers. The trainees are recruited from children of primary and junior high school graduates from coastal provinces and counties along the Min River. Each year, a large number of applicants are eager to join, demonstrating the coastal youths' determination to serve on the maritime frontier. However, the physical examinations are extremely strict, with standards such as a height of 160 centimeters, a weight of 48 kilograms, a chest circumference of 75 centimeters, a breathing difference of 7 centimeters, eyesight of 1.5 or above in both eyes on the international eye chart, a maximum blood pressure of 140, a pulse of 85, and the ability to return to normal five minutes after exercise. Those with color blindness, trachoma, otitis, hearing impairment, venereal disease, hemorrhoids, and skin diseases are all eliminated. Therefore, the general physical standards of the trainees are quite high, worthy of being called strong men. Their training is divided into two major departments: navigation and marine engines, with classes in driving, engines, guns, sails, torpedoes, communications, signals, military music, etc. The curriculum is very heavy, and there is a practical workshop at the Luoxing Pagoda, but there is a shortage of machinery and instruments. The training period is now shortened to six months and nine months depending on the complexity of the curriculum, in response to national defense needs. It is reported that the camp has trained over 120 teams, numbering over ten thousand people, some of whom have been assigned to various ships and vessels, some have been sent to the Qingdao Naval Training Corps for further training, and some have been sent abroad for advanced studies.</p>
<p>Learning from Pain and Rebuilding the Navy</p>
<p>After visiting the training camp, the reporter had a frank discussion with Camp Commander Ye on issues concerning naval construction and the future of Mawei. The navy is a product of the peak of modern scientific development, encompassing scientific principles such as meteorology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, mechanics, and optics, with complex content. Building a navy is not easy, requiring a spirit of precise organization and rigorous military management. During our country's current War of Resistance, the gateway was wide open, and merchants drove straight in, suffering from the lack of a navy. In 1941, Britain's survival against Germany was due to its powerful naval forces, which serves as a warning. Learning from the pain, we must immerse ourselves in rebuilding the navy to protect our seas. Ye spoke earnestly to the reporter, expressing his fervent hope for the future construction of the navy. He studied naval affairs from a young age, graduated from the Yantai Naval Academy, and was sent to Japan by the central government in the 19th year of the Republic (1930) to specialize in naval affairs. He served as captain of ships such as the Jing'an and Yingrui. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, he commanded the Madang artillery team, defending the fortress. Later, he was ordered to lay mines in the inland rivers of Zhejiang and Jiangxi to prevent the enemy from penetrating deeply, achieving remarkable merits. He is of imposing stature, with a loud voice, articulate, amiable, and strict in military discipline, highly respected by his subordinates. Regarding the future of Mawei, he stated that the shipyard has a well-established foundation, and the existing facilities are intact. In the future, if construction can be carried out on the existing foundation, repairing the remaining machinery, it would not be difficult to restore the old appearance and engage in repairing and building ships, which is also an important plan for establishing the navy. After returning, the reporter looked through</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China" plan to build Fuzhou into a second-class good port, renovating the Min River Estuary waterway below Mawei to a depth of over thirty feet, so that large ships can dock, Mawei is essential for the progress of building the new China.</p>

<p>Water and Electricity Deposit Regulations Have Set Standards</p>
<p>Reader Chen Dajun sent a letter appealing about the French-owned Tram and Electric Light Company's collection of deposits. We have received a letter from the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau stating: "Regarding the Shanghai Waterworks Company's method of collecting water usage deposits (i.e., meter deposits), this bureau has submitted to the Municipal Government for revision and approval at the 51st Municipal Conference in October of last year. The regulations stipulate that 'The amount of deposit paid by old users shall be based on twice the average monthly water fee for the previous twelve months.' Also, the method of collecting electricity usage deposits by the electric companies in the city has been submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval and has been implemented since May 1946. The regulations stipulate that 'If the company discovers that the deposit paid by the user is less than one and a half times the highest monthly electricity bill in the most recent four months, the company may collect additional fees from the user.' According to the above two regulations, the number of fees previously collected should be calculated as well. Furthermore, the company's standard for collecting electricity deposits from new users is based on the number of lamps installed by the user, and old users will not be charged additional fees for the time being. When transferring the account, the number to be increased will be based on one times the highest electricity bill in the most recent four months. If the company is found to be overcharging water and electricity deposits, or canceling previous fees without counting payments, please send the actual evidence to the bureau for investigation." Respectfully.</p>
<p>Diesel Fuel Should Not Be Piled Up on the Roadside</p>
<p>Next to a certain glass factory bordering Yanping Road and Yaoqiao Lane in Shude Village, a large amount of diesel fuel, several hundred huge barrels, is piled up on the road in front of the door. Nearby residents are uneasy. Given the frequent fires in the city, it is not appropriate to pile up flammable items in the open air. It is hoped that the authorities will order the factory to move them quickly to ensure safety. (Zhou Yuting)</p>
<p>Extend Route 11 Bus Rights</p>
<p>Editor: I have seen the Route 11 bus stop signs already nailed up on the roadside, indicating that the Route 11 bus will soon be meeting us. Its terminus is on the Bund on Edward Road. From the location of the ticket booth, I have nine humble suggestions to contribute to the relevant authorities, hoping that the route can be extended to Xiaodongmen. First, Xiaodongmen is where the Pudong ferry is located, and if it can be extended there, it can facilitate many people from Pudong. Second, it is where the Route 1 bus circles, which can connect and prosper the Nanshi area, encourage citizens to move to Nanshi, reduce the housing shortage, third the intersection of Edward Road is the end for French route 22, and it is place for many foreign vehicles, and the loading and unloading of cargo at the pier is already very crowded. If vehicles are added to turn around and stop here, it will increase the risk of blockage, and there are many places near Xiaodongmen that can be used as terminals, such as the original Waitan Road, etc., which can achieve multiple goals. I wonder if the authorities would be willing to adopt them? (Wang Yongye)</p>
<p>Please Pay Attention to the Security of Guhe Town</p>
<p>Editor: Guhe Town is a base area for the War of Resistance in eastern Anhui and has been stable for the past eight years. Recently, bandits have been looting the surrounding villages, such as the residents of the Dawang Temple in the town, and the home of Geng Boping in Youfangji Xianzong, have been repeatedly looted by bandits. Although the Ninth District Commissioner's Office has been reported to suppress the bandits, there is no effective solution, causing the people to be uneasy. Therefore, please disclose this to urge the Anhui military and political authorities to take measures to protect security. (Luo Yengeng, a resident of Guhe Town, Quanjiao)</p>

<h3>I Became a Village Representative</h3>
<p>— Tan Zhengbi</p>
<p>At this time of heightened calls for constitutional government, I have also become a village representative. After various contacts, many feelings have arisen. Because these are feelings, I will write them down and publish them here.</p>
<p>A village representative is the public opinion body of a village, equivalent to a county councilor in a county, and a provincial or municipal councilor in a province or city. Therefore, the village representative assembly is the lowest-level organization of the democratic structure, but it is the most capable of directly representing public opinion. But sadly, when most village representatives are elected, they do not know what this thing is, and they think that it is only used to represent the villagers in electing county councilors and to carry chairs for people. So everyone is a little annoyed at taking on this title. I think: It's not just our village that is like this, I'm afraid 99% of the towns and villages across the country are like this! Moreover, it's sad to say that not to mention the average representatives, who have all experienced the period of political tutelage and still cannot understand what their responsibilities are, even I, who graduated from university with a Bachelor of Arts degree and used to be a university lecturer, and usually pay attention to all laws, did not fully understand what a village representative was at first. It was only after being elected that I studied the relevant laws and suddenly realized.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think: Suppose the village representatives of a village are elected and the village representative assembly is established. If these representatives do not know what they should do and blindly listen to the instructions of the village administrative organs, then the village administrative organs will ask you to pass a motion and you will pass whatever motion they want. In this way, many things that were originally the responsibility of the village administrative organs can now be pushed onto you. Not only can you not represent public opinion, and fail to live up to the villagers' selection, but you are taking the heat for the village administrative organs. You have become a puppet, being used without even knowing it. This is a very dangerous thing in the period of constitutional government.</p>
<p>There is also another situation. Some representatives, although they don't know what they should do, but some who know a little bit think that the village representative assembly is the highest authority in the village, and the village representatives are special people in the village, with special powers. Then they use the name and power of the representative to arbitrarily bully the villagers and inherit the behavior of the local tyrants and evil gentry of the past. This is not my doomsaying, I have already heard of such people among the county councilors, so I dare not say that there are definitely none among the village representatives. This situation is as unfavorable to the implementation of constitutional government as the aforementioned situation, and this is obvious at a glance.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have a humble opinion that village representatives are not like county, provincial, or municipal councilors, because their level of knowledge only needs to be at the level of primary school graduation. Therefore, after being elected, they should be trained by the higher authorities. At least, they must be made to understand what kind of position they are in, what they should do, and what their relationship with the village administrative organs is. Then they can be taught to exercise their powers, become a truly public opinion body, and promote the realization of constitutional government.</p>
<p>This time, when I became a village representative to participate in the first representative meeting, I was elected chairman by everyone. I immediately stated two points to all the representatives without any reservation: (1) Do not think that it is not worth doing because it is only a basic village representative and does not bear the prominent responsibilities of county and municipal councilors, because this is the lowest-level organization of the public opinion body, the most direct public opinion body, and the most direct representative of public opinion. (2) We are here to represent the opinions of all the villagers and to supervise the village administrative organs. We are in an opposing position to the village administrative organs. Therefore, if we cannot supervise the village administrative organs, or if the village administrative organs have made mistakes and we do not correct them, and we do not exercise all the powers prescribed by law that we should do, then we are derelict in our duties and fail to live up to the entrustment of all the villagers. Then I roughly explained some of the powers prescribed by law that we should exercise.</p>
<p>Who knew that after I said this, the people who had no interest in this position and this meeting suddenly became excited, so that the meeting could continue without being lonely. Moreover, even after the meeting, everyone was still chatting, and they felt that my explanation of the powers that we could exercise was not clear and detailed enough, and that it would be best if I could explain it in more detail so that everyone could do it within this scope. Moreover, they also had an opinion that most of the representatives came from rural villages, and they had never dared to offend the village administrative personnel who were accustomed to acting arbitrarily. Although I had also explained to them that we can be immune to external responsibility for what we say in the meeting, they were still reluctant to speak out for fear of the consequences. The biggest reason, however, was that the village administrative personnel were also in attendance because they were invited to attend the meeting to report and listen to inquiries. Therefore, it affected them from saying many things that they were embarrassed to say in front of them. In this way, it is difficult to file a case of impeachment of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The meeting is still going on, but in addition to the various situations mentioned above, I think that there may be other unexpected things that will be discovered. Although I am busy writing for a living now, I am very happy to spare some time to do this thing well with everyone. Because this is not a matter of fame or profit, but a responsibility that every citizen should fulfill. This is something that people with more knowledge disdain to do, but I think that every intellectual should do it if they have such an opportunity. Because this is the only way to truly be close to the people and know the true suffering of the people!</p>
<p>Because this is an article of feelings, it is written in a very messy way, please forgive me!</p>
<h3>Looking Up</h3>
<p>— Meng Nong</p>
<p>A friend was holding a paintbrush, standing in front of an easel, as if pondering something.</p>
<p>I approached him and walked onto the high platform where he was standing. Looking closely, everything on the canvas was finished! In the foreground, there was a lush lawn, a winding lakeshore, rippled lake water, and willow branches almost hanging to the shore. In the midground, visible through the countless willow branches, was a wandering young man with a weather-beaten face, wearing a maroon-colored sweater, sitting quietly on the other side of the small lake, raising his powerless head, seemingly not moving or making a sound. In the background, there was a vast expanse of sky.</p>
<p>The entire scene was filled with new green, tender yellow, azure, maroon, and light gray. The brushstrokes appeared soft and lively, and the colors were extremely bright and full of vitality.</p>
<p>"Friend, almost finished, right?" I interrupted his thoughts.</p>
<p>"Finished? Not so easy! You see, the most difficult part to complete, and also the most important part, has not yet been completed!"</p>
<p>"What does that mean?" I asked, puzzled, showing my lack of understanding of his composition and design.</p>
<p>"I have not yet expressed the core of life in this painting. What I want to express is the melancholy mood of that wandering young man. Don't you see, he is intently looking up—at the clouds—at the ten incredible clouds?"</p>
<p>"Oh, haven't the delicate weeping willows already expressed the world that has been isolated in the heart of that wandering young man? Do you know the truth that 'only clouds cannot speak'? Clouds, as you like to say, are originally incredible! Clouds, sometimes, are as majestic as high mountains, sometimes, they fly like phoenixes, sometimes, they gallop like celestial horses. Their lives are constantly changing, with endless transformations. Just when you are about to capture them, they disappear without a trace. Just when you think you have painted them well, you don't expect that they are no longer what they were, because their very being is scattered!"</p>
<p>"Oh!" He put down his paintbrush and fell back into thought. "Then, let this young man always lift his head and look up at something!"</p>
<p>"Good! Let this never-finished masterpiece be titled 'Looking Up'!" I immediately responded in agreement.</p>
<h3>Leo Tolstoy Quotes</h3>
<p>— Translated by Jin Ning</p>
<p>In his life, people face the truth, standing in the light of the truth reflected before him, walking from darkness to light. If he cannot see the light of truth, nor can he see the road he has walked, he has already fallen back into darkness. But if he can find the illumination of truth where he is, he can still freely choose the road on this side or that side.</p>
<h3>Colors (Three Chapters)</h3>
<p>— Qingguo</p>
<p>Red</p>
<p>I am afraid of the dark.</p>
<p>And for me, the human world is unfamiliar, and the night road is even more unfamiliar.</p>
<p>But a strong belief compels me to continue forward. I have no reason to stop my footsteps.</p>
<p>Groping on a dilapidated and cold, rugged and steep night road, how desperately I need a lamp!</p>
<p>That red lamp, that lamp with leaping red flames.</p>
<p>The lamp lit with the eyes burning with the light of truth, with the lips exploding with the songs of battle, is the reddest and brightest.</p>
<p>Because such a flickering red lamp, like a flower, like the sun, is always smiling at me in my heart, I do not know what difficulties and terrors, fears and timidities are.</p>
<p>I run, I run happily.</p>
<p>On this vast and boundless dark plain, there are dim green will-o'-the-wisps, sharp wind sounds, and arranged abysses, crisscrossed with thorns.</p>
<p>I run, I run boldly and proudly.</p>
<p>I need a lamp, a lamp with a leaping red flame!</p>
<p>Green</p>
<p>I am very thirsty.</p>
<p>Passion scorches me, passion puts me in the bitter state of thirst.</p>
<p>Therefore, sometimes I also want to pour a glass or two of wine into my stomach.</p>
<p>I have many hopes, too many ideals. And a brave passion often adds to the fuel. - But I am becoming more and more thirsty.</p>
<p>I need wine! I need green wine!</p>
<p>Wine brewed with the lives of young girls and the dreams of children is very green; it is intoxicatingly green.</p>
<p>Besides green wine, I also like green grasses, green leaves, green buds, green pools, and green curtains.</p>
<p>Towards this raging prairie fire, who does not have a desire for hope and ideals? I hope that the giant bell of this era is filled with green wine, so that we can drink to our heart's content.</p>
<p>Yes, isn't green the color of hope and ideals? And I am intoxicated with many hopes and too many ideals.</p>
<p>I need green wine!</p>
<p>Blue</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if I had a bottle of such ink!</p>
<p>Deep blue, deep blue, dissolved with youth, with love, with tears.</p>
<p>However, I cannot find them, I cannot find them all.</p>
<p>The bottle of my soul is forever empty, and the tip of my imagination's pen is forever rusted.</p>
<p>I know that this human world lacks youth, love, and tears!</p>
<p>Now, all kinds of brands of ink are very light. When you write on paper, you cannot see clearly. After the erosion of time, it becomes blurred and fades. And the ink seller is still incessantly nagging to customers: That is very good ink, deep blue, deep blue.</p>
<p>How can I not feel annoyed? This era wants me to learn, wants me to learn to create poems!</p>
<p>But I cannot use the ink that is as light as gray,</p>
<p>I urgently need a bottle of such ink, deep blue, deep blue, dissolved with youth, with love, with tears. (March, Suzhou.)</p>
<h3>An Inch of River, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Feng</p>
<p>Crane—I just can’t remember… could it be that “what secret?”</p>
<p>Ping—(Laughing) Elder Brother, I think you are the biggest trickster.</p>
<p>Crane—No trickery, I swear!</p>
<p>Ping—Alright, alright, stop flipping through. You wouldn't have noted this down in your handbook. (Probably Crane is up to some trick again, pretending to flip through the handbook.) But it's just that "eight" character! (Hearing this, we all looked at each other excitedly.)</p>
<p>Crane—Tch! … "The secret of eight, I remember it. But I don't think there's any secret…</p>
<p>Ping—Can't say that, Elder Brother, this is very important. Just before setting off, Teacher Aoki repeatedly instructed that this secret is only known to two or three people; he told me to tell you, asking you and me to work together to sabotage this secret operation!</p>
<p>Crane—So, does that mean I probably don’t know the content either?</p>
<p>Ping—Of course… I don’t think you would know. They didn't use telegrams, because they wanted to keep it strictly confidential. The plan was personally delivered by Sakaki Toichi to Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Now, in just over thirty hours, the second step will be launched.</p>
<p>Crane—Second step?</p>
<p>Ping—Yes! The first step has already been launched, but it was not successful. That was the Shanghai aspect. The second step is about to be launched, and it seems to have been successful. But we haven't received confirmation yet.</p>
<p>Crane—Just the two of us can sabotage it?</p>
<p>Ping—Yes, we can; Teacher Aoki said that it's guaranteed. Otherwise, I wouldn't have come to China.</p>
<p>Crane—What exactly is going on, so serious?</p>
<p>Ping—Regarding the northern war, the military believes they have a good grasp and can conclude it. Unfortunately, the young officers have great ambitions and are unwilling to wait another three or four months; that is the second large-scale invasion of China. A few days ago, they secretly resolved in a military meeting this "eight" secret—to have the "eight" numbered special agent team launch provocative battles at the "eight" advance secret headquarters, triggering the Shanghai prelude battle on August 1; the Nanjing riot battle on August 8; the Guangzhou landing nerve war on August 18; and simultaneously launching a terrible tragedy in Hankou on August 18, echoing each other. They anticipate that on August 28, the Jinpu and Pinghan armies can be connected, or even united. Then this August 28th may be the day of "China's subjugation" signing. So the military called this resolution the "eight" secret.</p>
<p>Crane—Ha, very interesting!</p>
<p>Ping—Elder Brother, this is not an interesting matter, we must rush to Tianjin tonight, and before dawn, we must take a seaplane to Shanghai. Today is the 29th, with only over thirty hours left, we must sabotage this plan.</p>
<h3>Beethoven's Deafness</h3>
<p>— Wu Xianqi</p>
<p>Beethoven, born with a passionate and energetic temperament, was easily influenced by all the social changes. Misled by quack doctors and repeatedly deceived by the hope of a cure, year after year, he was ultimately forced to endure the pain of lingering deafness and lead a lonely life. His hearing, which had previously maintained a high degree of sensitivity—a sensitivity that even his fellow musicians did not possess or had never enjoyed—now, in the company of his peers, he had lost the joy of music, the elegance of conversation, and the flow of ideas. When he absolutely could not avoid attending social gatherings, he was almost forced to sit like an outcast; when he approached people, he would immediately feel a burning and anxious emotion, leading people to think or assert that he was a misanthrope.</p>
<p>In his letters to his brother Karl, he once said: "How shameful it is that when others stand beside me and hear the distant flute, I hear nothing, or when others hear the shepherd's song from afar, I hear nothing at all. These encounters have almost driven me to despair. Sometimes, I think I am standing on the edge of suicide—but art has held my hand. Oh! It seems that unless I offer all the melodies surging in my heart, I cannot leave this world. So I continue this miserable life—miserable, to be sure, that a person so sensitive should end up being transformed from beauty to ugliness by a sudden change. People tell me that I must use patience as a guide. In fact, I have already endured—. I still hope to resolve to endure further."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his love for humanity and his desire for progress remained within his heart. Art encouraged him not to force a career change—he had attempted to change his career to that of a philosopher—and virtue simultaneously prevented him from committing suicide, urging him to struggle unyieldingly. Despite nature placing many obstacles on his life's journey, he relied on his own strength to accomplish all his endeavors and join the ranks of outstanding artists and great figures.</p>
<p>Listen to his loud and moving words: "Let everything be as it is! I am happy to eagerly face death. If it comes before I have the opportunity to develop all my artistic talents, even if my fate is bad, it would be too hasty. I hope it comes later—but if the end comes swiftly, I am also happy, because does it not escort me out of endless suffering? Whenever you wish to come, then come! I will bravely face you."</p>
<p>How tragic and magnificent this is! Beethoven's life is a solemn and majestic symphony. He not only nourished future generations with the milk and sweat of music, but also overcame death with his fearless spirit.</p>
<p>Death is but a kind of rest, but art is eternal life.</p>

<h3>Bodhidharma</h3>

<h3>The "Don't Understand" Foreign Tiger</h3>
<p>— Chang Chu</p>
<p>After the promulgation of the economic emergency measures plan, the first to be arrested was a foreign tiger, whose crime was illegally buying and selling foreign exchange, deliberately violating the emergency measures plan, continuing to engage in this business after February 17, and whose inflow and outflow of US dollars did not comply with the official price of 12,000 yuan, violating Article 7 of the emergency measures plan.</p>
<p>A few days ago, this foreign tiger was tried for the first time. According to his own confession, all the illegal acts were due to not understanding Chinese regulations, leading him to fall into the legal net. This is an excuse, but behind the excuse is a serious psychological background.</p>
<p>Not understanding Chinese regulations has three interpretations. The first is confusion. We see that this tiger, who is the foreign exchange manager of a foreign firm, is already old and definitely not confused. The second is due to the habit of entering China without asking about Chinese prohibitions, always believing that foreign businessmen in China, especially in Shanghai, are in a "civilization outside" status, and can ignore Chinese law and only do what is beneficial to themselves. Although the Netherlands, to which the tiger belonged, signed a treaty with China as early as the 20th year of the Republic of China, abolishing the enjoyment of consular jurisdiction over overseas Chinese in China, the accumulated habits are difficult to reverse, and they always jump outside the circle of Chinese law to a greater or lesser extent. Habit becomes nature, and it has not changed to this day, so they neglect Chinese regulations.</p>
<p>The third interpretation is that they clearly know they are violating the law, but are blinded by profit, and vainly attempt to do some muddy water fishing in a turbulent market. Perhaps they saw that many people had done a lot of illegal things and were still at large, or perhaps they had been doing this all along and had never encountered any obstacles, and seeing many Chinese officials and businessmen who regarded the law as nothing, making a fortune through speculation, they hardened their hearts and started doing it; this third interpretation is the most likely.</p>
<p>In other words, the "don't understand" of the foreign tiger is actually seeing too clearly. The few foreigners who do evil in China are all those who have read this "old doctor" of China too thoroughly.</p>
<p>But now this foreign tiger is pretending to be confused and saying that he doesn't understand. The only way to deal with him is to make him understand greatly.</p>
<p>But it must be said that it is probably not enough for just one foreign tiger to understand.</p>

<h3>"Prohibition of Dancing"</h3>
<p>— Qing Hong</p>
<p>Attending a meeting inevitably involves making a speech or proposal, but speaking and proposing are by no means easy tasks. The truth cannot be told, and even if it is, it is not welcome. If one accidentally stings someone else, the consequences will be even greater. But keeping silent seems to be a disservice to this esteemed member status.</p>
<p>So clever people have invented a set of speaking logic. For thousands of years, the ancient Chinese country has emphasized "embellishment" and focused on "appearance." The saying goes, "Family ugliness should not be exposed." Based on this, one can find articles to write, such as a certain public treaty's "proposal to strictly prohibit dancing businesses."</p>
<p>Prohibiting dancing has the effect of saving resources, one; prohibiting dancing can rectify customs, two; prohibiting dancing can eliminate urban crime, three; … In addition, not only is there no need to worry about "consequences," but it can also greatly demonstrate the solemn appearance of a moral guardian, truly achieving multiple gains with one action.</p>
<p>As for the unemployed dancing girls becoming prostitutes, they deserve it—blame themselves for not being ambitious. And prostitution is a "closed-door affair," which is more reasonable than "openly" playing with dancing girls in dance halls. As for the convenience for those overly "well-fed" figures, they can simply fill the ranks with concubines, enjoying practical benefits while still adhering to the principle of not "exposing" it.</p>
<h3>Suggestions to the Post Office</h3>
<p>— Hong Yu</p>
<p>Recently, the postal authorities have been actively rectifying their operations. In addition to establishing five special mailboxes for receiving night-shift mail and the special train postal service for delivering mail along the Beijing-Shanghai line, they are also preparing to implement district delivery in this city to achieve special speed. Therefore, these days, the letters we receive all have a postal publicity item with different colored "Quick, Quick, Quick" stickers on the back of the envelope. This impresses upon people's minds the good concept of a state-run enterprise that is not at all careless.</p>
<p>The postal authorities are also planning a super-speed delivery process. They will organize visiting groups to consult with newspapers, schools, government agencies, social organizations, and individuals to seek opinions as a reference for further improvement. The humility and the spirit of striving to gather wisdom of the authorities truly shows they are not just going through the motions.</p>
<p>I am a person who sends and receives a lot of letters. Seeing that small mailboxes are sold in the newspapers, I bought one from a nearby post office. The style is indeed convenient, and the material is also very sturdy. However, there is a shortcoming: printed materials such as books and newspapers cannot be inserted into it. I think the entrance of the box can be enlarged a bit by digging a hole at the top, so that printed materials can also be inserted. If it remains unchanged, a lead cylinder can be installed on the side, so that printed materials can be attached to the side. Also, installing this mailbox is only convenient for inserting mail, but not for sending it out. While the postal authorities are soliciting opinions, I would like to offer the following suggestion: For households that have a small mailbox installed, another mailbox for sending mail should be attached. All ordinary letters and printed materials can be placed inside by the sender, and mail carriers or collectors should collect them several times a day. This would be convenient and fast, and more people would definitely install small mailboxes. And the speed of mutual delivery will definitely be improved.</p>
<h3>Praise for Success</h3>
<p>— Hulu</p>
<p>In the Kunming parliamentary election, a certain gentleman sold a house and a coffin he had prepared, earning 20 million to use for activities.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic about the election, the glory of a parliamentarian! How to win depends on relationships; winning over people depends on money. Scratching head, touching ear: "What should I do?"</p>
<p>Buying a house and buying a coffin, the energy is shocking, the title is so good, life and death are light! Rather sleep without a coffin, just wanting a false name! Success is guaranteed, everything is about money!</p>

<h3>"Give Me Liberty"</h3>
<p>— Xingyun</p>
<p>Among anti-Nazi films, this is an excellent work. It recounts the story of seven German political prisoners who escaped from a concentration camp in 1936. These seven people included a novelist, a musician, a worker, a professor... In the end, six of them were captured, taken back to the concentration camp, and executed, hung on crosses. Only George survived, enduring danger and escaping with the help of underground comrades, fleeing to the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The screenplay and directing are both highly skilled and concise. The film's atmosphere, the exquisite use of the director's lens, and the rich human touch of many scenes create a vivid and powerful historical record of anti-Nazism!</p>
<p>Look at the use of several shots, how moving: George, exhausted and hungry, lies in a church, the image of the Virgin Mary transforming into his past lover, his past life; Nazi police rush over, George dodges, the police rush past, and then a few flashbacks show George injuring his hand by climbing over the wall and grasping sharp pieces of glass; this can be used as an example for us.</p>
<p>Other scenes, such as Paul being released after being arrested; Paul smiling bitterly as he emerges from behind a curtain, his wife sitting alone there, seeing her husband, crying sincerely and joyfully, a smile and a cry, perfectly capture the joy and sorrow of a young couple with anti-Nazi sentiments.</p>
<p>Also, the scene of the musician being hunted down; the crosses in the misty concentration camp; all appear so tragic.</p>
<p>Spencer Tracy plays George with depth and simplicity, proving himself to be a successful and experienced actor.</p>
<p>The female lead, Signe Hasso, has too few scenes.</p>
<p>It seems impossible that George's close friend Paul would be released after being arrested. I wonder if the screenwriter wanted to add a bit of comedic atmosphere?</p>
<p>In short, this is a good anti-Nazi film after "My Land and My People," worth watching.</p>
<h3>"Drunkenness Tester"</h3>
<p>— Zhong Guang</p>
<p>—People who are drunk will not be allowed to drive cars.</p>
<p>The number of car accidents in the United States each year is truly alarming, and the number of accidents caused by drunk driving is increasing. Recently, Michigan has begun to equip each patrol car with a "drunkenness tester."</p>
<p>The "drunkenness tester" is extremely simple in construction. It is a specially designed toy balloon. When the police encounter a driver suspected of being excessively drunk, they immediately order him to stop, and then order him to blow air into this balloon. The chemicals stored in the jacket can then automatically record the amount of alcohol contained in his lungs and blood.</p>
<p>Medical theory says: When the alcohol content in the human body is less than 0.02%, it can be considered sober. When the concentration is between 0.05% and 0.15%, the person is no longer suitable to drive. If it is above 0.15%, then he is completely in a state of muddy drunkenness.</p>
<p>The "drunkenness tester" was invented by a doctor named Glenn C. Forrester based on the above theory. Inside the balloon is a glass test tube. It is filled with glass particles, mixed with a small amount of purple oxidizing agent. From the point where the purple color fades, it can be determined on the spot how much alcohol the driver suspected of being excessively drunk had consumed beforehand, because the more alcohol the breath contains, the faster the purple color disappears.</p>
<h3>Wine-Blood and Lamb-Fat</h3>
<p>— Chen Desheng</p>
<p>With nothing to do, I casually flipped through old books and read, "Full cup of fine wine, the blood of a thousand people, finely cut fat lamb, the grease of ten thousand people." I recalled the two lines in my humble work "Candle tears fall, the tears of the people fall; songs are high, the cries of resentment are high," which appropriately coincide with the above! But excessive drinking of fine wine and excessive greed for fat lamb will surely bring disaster to the mouth and belly. I ask those who drink fine wine in the morning and eat fat lamb in the evening, do you think I am right?</p>
<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Xiao Shen also walked out of the dining room, his face showing concern, taking the opportunity to greedily gaze at Lan's face, and even her entire body.</p>
<p>"Tell Ah Shi to go look!" Fat Xu leaned back on the wicker chair, saying casually. In his life, he only believed that goods and banknotes were the most important things. What did a relative's daughter matter?</p>
<p>Lan had already rushed out, shouting "Ah Shi" all the way.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the air raid siren also went off.</p>
<p>Fat Xu and the old man could not help but change color, and together they left the dining table.</p>
<p>"That's not right!" Xiao Shen said very vigilantly, "The Japanese air force must have used Hengyang's airport, so they came so quickly. Tonight may really be bombed!"</p>
<p>Everyone immediately became flustered. Fat Xu rushed upstairs to pack important things, preparing to take them and hide from the air raid.</p>
<p>"Where do we hide from air raids here, is it in Lao Jun Cave?" Old Zhuo asked, following Xiao Shen. He had only been in Guilin for a short time, and of course he could not be as calm about air raids as the old residents of Guilin.</p>
<p>Xiao Shen did not pay much attention to him, just nodded, and then rushed inside; he meant to find Lan, to see if there was an opportunity to show some attentiveness.</p>
<p>But Lan and Ah Shi had already rushed out.</p>
<p>"...Can't go anywhere! Either in the Wang family's house in the east, or in the small shop in the back..." Ah Shi walked along, muttering to himself; it was like talking to himself, and like comforting Lan.</p>
<p>"Ah Shi! Ah Shi! Come and get the boxes!" Xu Shaoming shouted at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>The sound of commotion gradually arose on the streets outside. People with more sensitive hearing could also hear a buzzing sound coming from the distant sky.</p>
<p>Ah Shi looked a little embarrassed, not knowing whether he should first take the master's relative out to find the child or go upstairs to carry the boxes for the master; but time did not allow him to consider, and Xu Shaoming called him again upstairs. This time, he even stomped his feet hard on the floorboards, obviously anxious.</p>
<p>"But, Cousin Ming...!" Lan cried, wanting to argue with Xu Shaoming.</p>
<p>But Ah Shi had already gone upstairs.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian, who had not spoken for a long time, suddenly pushed away the Zhuo Assistant and Xiao Shen who were blocking him, and ran outside, jumping and running.</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid! Lan, even without Ah Shi, I will find Fei Fei back alone!" He said without turning his head. (2)(5)</p>
