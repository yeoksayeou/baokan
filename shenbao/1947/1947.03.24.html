<h3>軍事報告决議案　簡略提示注意事項七點希各主管機關規劃施行</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕三中全會廿三日上午九次大會中，通過「對於軍事報吿之決議案」，原文如下：</p>
<p>本會議聽取陳參謀總長軍事報吿後，備悉一年來軍事之各項措施，在最高統帥領導之下，慘淡經營，勵精圖治，甚著成效，舉如解除日軍武裝，遣送日俘返國等軍事復員工作，均能按照計劃，圓滿達成，至堪嘉慰。至於整軍建軍諸方案，赤經確切執行，逐步實施，如軍隊數量之裁减及質量之充實，國防體制之改革及機構之統一，均爲顯著之收穫，尤以我忠勇愛國之將士，浴血犧牲，備歷艱苦，支持長期抗戰，獲致最後勝利，本當釋胄還鄕，休養生息，政府體念時艱，俯卹民困，對共黨再四忍讓，迭事商談，其誠意與苦衷，當爲中外人士所共諒。奈以共黨無理拒絕，緊閉和平之門，甘作人民之敵，破壞國家統一擾亂地方安寗，以致整軍計劃未能迅速完成，建軍工作復難順利推進，遂使爲救國而抵抗侵略之將士，不得不爲救民而戡定兵亂，此固　保國保民之必要措施，然於戰後　國工作，影響甚　，深盼地方秩序早日恢復，俾我舉國同胞共享和平安定之幸福　値茲綏靖任務尙未完成，建軍工作亟待推進之際，對於軍事方面，應行注意事項，簡略提示如下：</p>
<p>（一）提高官兵待遇，注意官兵福利，以保　其本及其家屬之生活。</p>
<p>（二）振制士氣，恢復我國軍固有之傳統的　　精神，使之認識其行動在於）　　國本，拯救民生。</p>
<p>（三）整飭軍風紀，務使軍民水乳相融，以收合作之功效。</p>
<p>（四）安置無職軍人，並切實辦理軍官轉業，使軍人無失業之　，對於榮譽軍人，尤須設法安置之，以維緊軍心。</p>
<p>（五）信賞必罰，綜覈名實，舉凡兵力之統計，軍情之報吿，以及給養之領發等，必須確實，倘有誑報　瞞等情，應予嚴懲。</p>
<p>（六）切實施行兵役法，並改善新兵之生活，請求新兵之訓練，以長久，而免依賴國外之接濟。</p>
<p>以上數端，均爲當前軍事上亟待舉辦之事項，仍希各主管機關　加研討，規劃施行。至於綏靖區域黨政軍民，必須打成一片，通力合作，俾民衆成爲重事之外國，軍事成爲政治之前鋒，政治成爲黨務之表現，三民主義成爲民衆之領導中心，尤希各有關部門，切實予以注意。</p>

<h3>全會通過外交决議案　重申我堅定立塲　維護世界和平歡迎合作</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿三日電〕三中全會廿三日下午大會，通過過外交審委會對於外交之決議案，全文如次。</p>
<p>自二中全會迄今，適屆一年，在此一年中，外交方面之重要措施，大體均能符合二中全會之決策，我國迭决參加國際會議所持之立塲，允稱得體，與盟邦商治，已於一年中遣送日俘，日僑約三百萬人，爲我國及東亞和平除一重大遺患，本全會對於美國之協助及其努力，殊寄溧切之銘感。最近、我國一再聲明嚴正之立塲，反對並拒絕參加任何國際會議討論涉及中國內政問題，尤爲全會一致之主張。當此國際情形錯綜複雜之際，中國當一秉愛護世界和平之初衷，爲盟邦合作而努力，但中國獨立自主之立塲，領土主權之完整，常繼續盡力維護，不容稍有損害，本全會認爲，本黨旣定之外交方針，極爲正確，茲爲明朗具體起見，分列以下八項，以資遵循：（一）重申中國維護愛好世界和平之決心，中國戰後之建設，端賴國際和平與合作，中國當一貫爲友邦間之互信互助而努力、（二）應切實加强聯合國安全理事會常任理事國間之　緊。（三）中國當以友好之態度，堅定之立塲，嚴格實行中蘇友好同盟條約，使該條約確實成爲中蘇兩國和平合作之基礎。（四）聯合國　章所定「會員國主權平等」及「不干涉內政」之原則，爲世界和平之基點，必須予以貫澈。（五）領土主權之完整，爲國家生存之所繫，本黨常繼續五十餘年來國民革命之努力，予以維護。（六）本黨對於世界各地民族獨立自由之運動，寄以灤切之同情與尊重，但對各地僑胞之生命財產利益，必須盡力維護。（七）對於日本不取報復主義，但對其武力侵略主義之復萌，必與各盟邦合作，加以防制，並促進其政治之民主化。至於中國在日本侵略戰爭中所受生命財產之慘重損害，至於正義公道之合法要求，常責成其切實賠償。（八）在平等互惠原則之下，歡迎國際資本技術之合作。</p>
<p>此後執行外交政策時，尤須格外注意運用之靈敏，態度之堅定，以期貫澈保障國權之主張，爲達到保僑任務起見，一面當加緊進行條約之談判，一面並須愼選幹練人員，以充實各地使館及領館，其他應行改進之處，當由主管機關隨時密切注意。</p>
<p>總之，中國與同盟國並肩作戰，不惜空前之犧牲，以換得共同之勝利，中國對此歷盡艱苦取得之國際地位，當盡其全力，以資維護，實爲本黨與全國同胞一致堅決主張，獨立自主强盛之中國，爲確保世界和平不可缺少之條件。本黨旣領導八年英勇之抗戰，反對侵略　武主義，此後必以同樣之精神與努力，與盟邦密切合作，在國際正義旗幟之下，共奠世界和平。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>印度局勢的癥結</h3>
<p>印度新任總督蒙巴頓勛爵業於日昨行抵德里，卽將宣誓就職。此一新任總督之蒞任，正當英國宣布退出印度之時，他的來到印度，無疑地是在淸理大英帝國在印度的統治。蒙巴頓勛爵以英國皇族的身份，又加上是一個卓越的軍政人才，過去曾以盟國東南亞戰塲的統帥駐節印度錫蘭；此次戰後以印度總督的身份重蒞舊地，自然是一個最適當的人選。不過此次蒙巴頓勛爵的重來印度，已不是以軍事統帥的資格，而是以印度總督，也許是末任印度總督的身份來到德里，是共情緖似未必同於昔日主帥東南亞戰事的時候。此後印度將遭逢怎樣一種命運，無疑地有蒙巴頓勛爵的份兒。</p>
<p>蒙巴頓勛爵之以印度總督的身份來到印度，迎接他的是什麽？是印度的不安。在印度的首省孟加拉，當地的回教聯盟正在計議「巴基斯坦日」來歡迎這位總督的蒞任；在印度南方的脫來梵哥（Travancore）又主張獨立，此外在潘哲（Punjab）白色華（Peshewar）及其它地區的騷動，亦復未息。今日在印度，回教與印度教的人民問彼此感情之惡劣，眞有每况愈下之勢。在他們之問，被此都有畏懼，猜忌，及嫉恨。這是一個動亂的印度，而英國退出印度的宣吿及新任總督蒙巴頓的抵任，不特似乎未能使動亂趨於平靜，反而使這種動亂更趨於激盪，我們替印度的前途担憂，認爲這種動亂的局勢必須穩定下來。</p>
<p>造成這種動亂的局勢的當然是印度教人與回教人的不易相處。印回之爭，不僅是一個宗教問題，實是在印度的歷史問題。如果是一個「國家」，則印度是一個龐大而複雜的國家，其複雜的程度，非我們所能想像。過去英國的統治印度便在利用這種複雜。利用這種種矛盾來統治印度是大英帝國的一貫政策。在印度國民大會黨猖在的時候，大英帝國的統治者便利用了回教聯盟來抵制印度國民大會黨，且將他們的領袖如尼赫魯甘地等人逮捕下獄。「巴基斯坦」的口號，雖有其歷史的背景，然多少實出於帝國統治者的扶持。新德里也許包括倫敦的政策似乎是用回教聯盟來抵制國民大會黨，又用國民大會黨來抵制回教聯盟。「巴基斯坦」口號的提出是回敎聯盟在首次會議所贏得的勝利。及其贏得了勝利以後，帝國的統治者於是又轉向來扶持尼赫魯及國大黨。所以造成印度動亂的，英國的統治者實在應該負其責任。</p>
<p>如今蒙巴頓總督旣已到任，英國亦已公布於一九四八年六月撤離印度。此刻所亟應爲的是：如何能够使印回合作。印回的裂痕愈深，則對於印度的前途，未必是有利的。澳大利亞的首相在其國會辯論中，已爲印度的前途担憂，我們於此以鄰邦的關係所欲言的，就是英國在撤離印度以前，必須獲致印回問的協議，則印度方有其前途。魏菲爾元帥旣多少以此而去職，我們希望蒙巴頓勛爵能够看到印度局勢混亂的癥結，能够得到一個妥善的解決。</p>
<p>公用事業的貼補政策</p>
<p>公用事業的漲價，已經全國物價委員會正式否決。其虧累之數，則由政府予以貼補。此事意義，極爲重大，決不可視爲單是公用事業一個懸案的解決。</p>
<p>憶二月十六日經濟緊急措施方案通過的時候，主席的談話裏頭，曾經說明：「各項公用事業，如政府繼續貼補，則預算無法維持，故此後應酌予合理增加」。可知此次的漲價案，予以斷然否決，而寗由政府擔承貼補，實具有深長的意義，與極大的央心。</p>
<p>此中意義之一，當然在求物價之穩定，與力戒領導漲價之覆轍。在抑平物價這一點上看，固然步伐整齊，主張堅定，可予天下人以共見，而力矯過去國營事業率先漲價的作風，拿事實來表現安定物價的決心，允足爲推行經濟緊急措施時一個鮮明的指標。</p>
<p>貼補的數目如何，範圍如何，期問如何，乃至方式如何，截至執筆時止，我們還沒有見到。但所指公用事業，，當然不限於一處，而所予貼補的數目，總須使各該事業足够維持爲最低限度，那麽，其數額的龐大，與擔負的重大，也可以窺見一斑了。在這千孔百瘡，財政極度困難的時侯，政府還願意肩負這個重擔，倘使不是眞爲抑平物價，安定民生，誰也不相信牠眞個會得實現。</p>
<p>所謂貼補，其方式甚多，不一定限於拿出現錢來補助。譬如國營的交通事業，如鐵路，郵政等，在明明虧本的時侯，並不提高價目，以求彌補，而寗可坐貼開支，這也是貼補的一種，而且也無異於拿出現錢來貼補。此次所定不准漲價的範圍，並且不限於國營，有好許多是屬於地方公營或私火經營的。那麽，非予以現錢或物資的補助，無從達到貼補的目的。這種辦法的大規模地實施，在外國雖很通行，在我國却還是創見。古稱：將作焉簡，將畢焉鉅」，這個含苞待放的蓓蕾，也很値得珍視。</p>
<p>關於物價的統制，戰時戰後，有過不少的嘗試，而結果均不甚良好。此中原因自然很多，而偏重箝制，不求合理的調整與補救，實是一個主因。商人有句老話，叫做「千做萬做，蝕本勿做」。如硬叫他們蝕本，其結果，不是陽奉陰違，具文僅存，便是營私舞弊，花樣百出。主張統制的人們，往往忽視了這一點，以爲各國多採取這個政策，我們何獨不可倣效？不知各國辦理統制，除特定的商品和事業外，並不以收入爲目的，甚至由國庫支出鉅額款項，明白予以貼補。所以物價降低，而商民樂從。原因就是單求他們减少利潤，不許謀取暴利，並不是生吞活剝，硬要他們停業，蝕本，坐貼開銷，如此而已。</p>
<p>所以此次公用事業的貼補辦法，如果能够實行，這不但在抑平物價這一點上是一個有力的措施，而且在物價的統制上，也是一個很大的進步。這個原則，倘能隨時隨地，設法加以運用，我們相信，所有經濟緊急措施工作，必能愛在微博蔓延時地展開。並不是說：物物需要貼補，也並不是說，各業都要補助。只要本着這個不存圖利的方針，和力求合理的作風，便可以上下相孚，精誠合作，省去無數的隔閡和葛籐了。</p>

<h3>杜魯門突然下令　肅清不思實份子　共產及法西斯份子均在內　凡任職行政機關者一律須受調查</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕杜魯門總統今日下今肅淸不忠於職守之公務人員，並規定測騐忠實之各種新標準。命令中規定任何人申請在行政機關任職者，須調查是否忠實，絕無例外，目前之申請辦法無此規定。各機關應向聯邦偵緝局提出其現有職員名單，以備審核。檢察長應經常提出全部破壞團體之最近名單。任何人加入此種團體為會員，即可視為不忠。黑單中包括全部　權，法西斯，共產或破壞團體，以及提議或贊成以武力剝奪人民之憲法的權利，及企圖利用非憲法的手段，改變現政府形式之人。同時一九三九年九月以來所有被調查之人，將列成總表。新辦法得由政府各機關援用。但不適於政府之司法或立法部門，亦不包括改變現行軍隊安全條例之意義在內。政府或將要求增撥足間服務委員會與聯邦偵緝局之經費，前者將為一千五百萬美元，後者將為二千萬美元。總統稱：以上兩機關必須自行負責肅淸內部。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕社魯門總統今日簽字批准限令物價管理局於六月三十日結束，但咨請國會准由其他機關繼續統制房租與食糖。惟參議院共和黨領袖開會結果，對房租食糖應吾繼續統制及方法如何一節，意見紛歧，未獲協議。</p>
<h3>援助希土法案通過後　美國將貸款南韓　此項計劃目前不致予以公布</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕美國會於上週內曾討論應吾通過杜魯門總統以四億美元援助希土兩國，以抵抗共產主義在近來之威脅。在通過此項建議成為法案之前，尚需辯論多時，但最後必能加以通過，而開始美國外交政策之新趨勢。關心遠東方面之若干讓員認為美國在辯論結束之前，在遠東亦應從事反抗共產主華之經濟戰爭。國務院一方面希望如此，一方面發展已經開始之計劃，已擬成在三年內以五億元至六億美元援助朝鮮之計劃，其中二億以上在明年內用以重建朝鮮之鐵路，紗廠及其他工業。此項計劃不致予以公布，官方在援助希臘事由國會批准之前，且將否認此說，但將於有利之時期向國會提出援助朝鮮法案。</p>
<h3>韓南政局　即將改觀</h3>
<p>徐載弼博士自美返國</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿三日電〕此間朝鮮人士消息：此次馬歇爾在蘇京將向蘇聯試探談判南北鮮成立統一政府問題，設如交涉失敗，美國將暫時放棄其建立朝鮮統一政府之計劃，而准許卅八度以南先行建立政府以滿足南鮮人民之願望。朝鮮革命元老徐載弼博士已於本月十五自美返抵漢城，彼將以南鮮民政廳及霍奇將軍最高顧問之名義，担任美國與朝鮮人民間之橋樑。渠或並可能為將來南鮮政府之有力籌備人。徐為韓民族主義之先鋒，參與甲辰政變，失敗後即潛藏美艦，至新大陸後入美國籍，研究醫學，得博士學位。乙未年以美人資格返韓，任韓國顧問駐漢城。不一二年，遭韓王之責遺還美，伊時徐曾坐漢城終南山痛哭韓之將亡。四十年後，徐復返國，任新興榦國之顧問，韓民皆寄以無限熱望（按金九李承晚亦爲顧問）。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社索菲亞廿二日電〕聯合國調查委員會小組委員會自希臘啓程前來保國，原定至奈夫洛柯浦城考察，現已臨時改變計劃，決定逕來此問，可望於廿四日晨行抵保希邊境。</p>
<p>希臘一省　宣布戒嚴</p>
<p>〔合衆社雅典廿三日電〕希臘政府於廿三日召開內閣緊急會議後，即頒佈在拉科尼亞省游擊隊活躍地區內實施戒嚴。希總統馬克西摩斯宣佈，政府將採取各種步驟以恢復秩序。據政府公告稱。陸軍部長及公安部長將飛赴拉科尼亞省巡視戒嚴實施情形。拉科尼亞省之軍事及民事當局將由特別軍事法庭加以懲罰。緣該地區內之左右　份子最近互相集團殘殺，最近三十六小時內允烈，有右翼領袖二人，左翼份子五十二人及共黨一人遭暗殺。同時科省首府西塞拉城右翼份子於二十一日曾暗殺三十九人，科省西南之瑪利亞城內亦有左派份子十三人慘遭殺戮。</p>
<h3>希游擊隊領袖　發表政治見解</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社　劃尼加港廿二日電〕聯合國調查巴爾幹委員會全體代表前往希南兩國邊界實地調查，並與希臘游擊隊領袖馬瀾柯斯將軍會晤，馬氏未能準時趕到，故有一部份代表於本月十六日，即返抵此間。蘇波兩國代表仍留該處，興馬爾柯斯將軍會唔後，亦已於本日偕同波蘭，阿爾巴尼亞，南斯拉夫曁保加利亞聯絡員返抵此間。據談稱：馬爾柯斯將軍曾日：「一俟英美停止干涉，希臘和平即可恢復」云。</p>
<h3>奧斯汀遄返華府　檢討美新政策對聯合國影響</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕聯合國機構美國代表奧斯汀今日遄返華府，足見美國援助希臘土耳其防止近東共產主義一案與聯合闊問關係之密切。參院外交委員會主席范登堡與民主黨參議員康納利二氏昨日提出之援助希土法案序文中亦曾直接涉及聯合國，據稱聯合國安理會承認希臘邊境局勢之嚴重。同時國務院已從事擬具公函，等待總統批准，由奧斯汀遞交聯合國機構秘書長賴伊，闡明美國立塲及此項行動之必要。關於美國此項單獨行動對聯合國各會員國有何影響一節，聞奧氏甚抱不安。范登堡與康納利則促請大衆注意聯合國糧食農業機構亦曾承認希臘必須獲得財政經濟援助，且曾建議希臘應向聯合國機構及英美二國請求此種援助。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿三日電〕外傳社魯門總統曾致函聯合國機構秘書長賴伊，說明美國對於希土兩國之態度，此說頃由白宮新聞秘書羅斯再度加以否認。</p>
<h3>美援助希土月底難實現</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿二日電〕參議院民主黨領袖巴克萊本日招待記者時談稱：預料美國撥款四億元援助希土兩國之法案，於三月卅一日英國停止該二國之經濟援助以前，尚不能通過。杜魯門總統之援助法案屆時尚不及提付參議院討論。如果在三月底之前美國必須援助希土兩國，則復興財政公司或將貸予緊急借款。巴克萊並宣稱：渠擬於四月初旬赴希臘，土耳其及巴勒斯坦一行，視察當地情况云。</p>
<h3>阿拉伯同盟舉行例會　切盼獲得美積極援助</h3>
<p>〔中央社安哥拉廿二日電〕當全球正注意莫斯科會議及美國對土希關係之際，阿拉伯七國高級官員自三月十七日開始，在開羅舉行之阿拉伯同盟例會，幾被忽略。阿拉伯同盟秘書長阿札木今日打破沉寂，宣布一切阿拉伯國家支持尼羅河流域即「埃及蘇丹」之完成統一，並亟待英軍撤退整個尼羅河流域。阿拉伯同盟事實上代表中東三千五百萬阿拉伯人。該同盟曾討論巴勒斯坦問題並一致堅持反對猶太人入境，彼並宣佈該同盟支持英埃僵局中之埃及。據記者所知，阿拉伯國對於美國對土希援助一事極為注意，並希望類似之援助。埃及綽號綠衫黨之靑年黨，素以極竭國家主義著名者，該黨領袖曾致電杜魯門，謂埃及亦應包括於反共防綫之內，該電並要求美國支持，將英埃案件提交安理會，沙地阿拉伯旣因對美作軍事工業與經濟之讓步而入美國之懷抱，今日整個近東與中東，均望美國之援助，迄今為止，均以逮捕與襲擊方法，全力壓制共產主義，僅叙利亞與黎巴嫩兩國之共產黨，獲得法律地位。黎巴嫩外畏曾特別指斥中東國家需要美國對希土類似之協助。</p>
<h3>美佔領軍當局突下令　搜捕韓左派領袖</h3>
<p>〔路透社漢城廿二日電〕美軍當局突於今晚下令逮捕左派領袖三十名，各左翼要員大多被捕，惟立法議會議員未有被捕者。衆信此一搜捕行動，當與華府政策之轉趨强硬有關。</p>
<h3>美將照會有關各國　起草審查對日和約　對日和約藍本美將擬就</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕國務部官員今日宣稱：美國將在其照會中，向有關各國政府建議，謂中國。美國，英國。澳洲。及蘇聯五强起草對日和平條約，而由其餘遠東委員會之十一國會員，組成一審查部。同時，美國務興陸軍兩部，關於日本和約之藍本，業已授近完成，但該官員否認此項藍本之開始，並非由於麥帥之敦促。據該宮員之意見，達成一園滿之和的，至少將需九月至一年之時間。向日本要求賠款之各國，如中·菲·及美國，或即將予以滿足，但就朝鮮情彩言之，該國之要求，由於美國援助該國之故，顯然尚有待，以便加以審核。又據該官員稱，賠款問題中爭執最烈者，或為英蘇問關於其太身所受之損失問題。蘇聯將提出要求，謂日本在戰時牽制蘇聯在西伯利亞之兵力，使其不能與希特勒作戰，遭受損失。英國受美國之支持，將否認此點云。</p>
<h3>希土案秘密文件　美已公布一部</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕代理國務卿艾克遜頒給衆院外委會闡明杜魯門總統援助希土提案背景之秘密文件已於今日公布，查此項歷史背景並並無標作「機密」之價值。其中包含冗長年表多種，遠溯至一九一一年希臘修改憲法及土耳其歷史上奧托曼軍隊瓦解。泰拉恩佛二執政出亡之時。某一件則曾扼要叙述希臘局勢，提供希臘在內戰中奮鬥之資料。但今日公開之文件僅約全部檔案中半數，其餘留待明日發表，若干觀察家預料當較重要云。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統於三月十二日宣布援助希土新外交政策後，國務院及陸海軍部要員即於次日開會討論。圖中坐者（自左至右）爲助理國務卿艾克遜，參院議長范登堡，參院外委會主席康納利；立者為陸長柏德遜與海長福萊斯泰、（本報特約紐約時報攝寄）</p>

<h3>泛亞洲會議　昨在印開幕　出度卅二國代表</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里廿三日電〕泛亞洲會議今日在舊德里古堡中開幕，由印度臨時政府領袖尼赫魯主特，出席亞洲三十二國代表二百五十人，觀禮羣衆達五千人，盛極一時。大會主席為奈都夫人，會期十日。討論問題以經濟文化與社會為限，不涉政治。遠東大國未參加會議者，僅日太一國，蘇聯亞洲部份十七個代表列席旁聽，英美法澳亦派有旁聽員。</p>
<p>〔中央社新德里廿三日專電〕我出席泛亞洲會議代表團長鄭彥棄及另二代表，今晨會出席指導委會，尼赫魯曾於該會中致詞。</p>
<p>〔中央社新德里廿二日專電〕泛亞洲會議我國代表團今晚抵此，代表團於下機後發表聲明稱，「印度為中國之鄰邦及朋友，尼赫魯於中國與日本作殊死鬥爭時訪問重慶，對中國人民留有深刻印象。渠等亦不能忘懷印度人民於一九四二年對蔣主席暨蔣夫人之熱烈歡迎。印度人民之偉大領袖甘地先生，乃對全人類完美與善意之燦爛楷模，吾等確信兩國歷來之友誼與尊敬，將與日俱增，為保證此點，貴我兩國現且已交換大使，際此歷史名城中召開泛亞會議之前夕，亞洲各國代表，齊集商討共同利益問題，吾人之內心，乃充滿希認，祝此會議，將為亞洲及所有亞洲人民帶來較好時日之黎明。」</p>
<h3>荷印締約　印尼已表同意</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞廿三日電〕據日　訊，東印度共和國內閣今日決議接受荷蘭政府邀請，立即簽訂井里汶協定，不因荷軍近佔爪哇東部之莫卓柯多而展緩。但總統沙利已奉令於簽約後，繼　迫請荷方解決莫車柯多事件。</p>
<h3>德政體爭論告一段落　外長會休會兩日　特委會就各議案繕綜合報告</h3>
<p>〔中央社莫斯科廿二日電〕外長會議於星期日（二十三日）起休會兩天，俾便各方準備具體之建議案，會中已設立特別委會，蘇由維辛斯基代表，美由克萊將軍代表，英出席者爲賀伯區，法爲艾爾蓬。特別委會之工作，在綜合不同之議案，於二十五日向外長會議提出報告。外長會將於二十五日下午四時復會。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿二日電〕四强外長本日舉行第十二次會議，議決休會二天。外長會議之第一階段及過去二日內關於未來德國政體之爭論，至此告一段落。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫在本日會議中，堅決反對聯邦化之任何計劃。莫氏所提出之計劃，與第一次大戰後之「威瑪憲法」相類似。蘇聯主張德國之未來政體，應為希特勒秉政以前之政體，一如威瑪共和國之體制。莫洛托夫要求各代表對威瑪憲法加以研究，並謂其中優點甚多。</p>
<h3>德未來政制　四強立塲不同</h3>
<p>在明後二日之休會期間，四强外長對於許多建議案均需加以研究。現簡述四國之立塲如下：</p>
<p>法國</p>
<p>反對急於成立臨時政府，主張德國未來之政體，　為權力分散之聯邦制，而中央政府之權力以愈弱愈妙。</p>
<p>英國</p>
<p>主張即刻組織臨時政府，然後組織權力受限制之聯邦政府，而重要權力均歸諸各地方政府。</p>
<p>美國</p>
<p>主張從速組織臨時政府，最後由德國人民訂定主權在民之憲法，限制政府之權力，其重心在於地方分權。</p>
<p>蘇聯</p>
<p>亦要求即刻組織臨時政府，然後組織民主共和國，設置兩院之國會及政府，保證各州有憲法上之權利。按蘇聯之計劃與聯邦政府制度相似，但關於限制中央政府之權力及規定各州權利等不無出入耳</p>
<h3>統一德經濟　英提新建議</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿二日電〕貝文外相今日在外長會議中，提出關於德國經濟統一之新建議，內稱，德國工業之復興，應逐漸進行，對於以煤斤供給被解放國，應予以適當之注意，而生產之增加率，應與煤斤出口之需要相關，於此應注意者，即不可因比而增加佔領國之費用。就此一建議觀，其意似在使法國得獲更多之煤斤，以與英國主張使德國鋼鐵產量提高至每年一千萬噸之建議相平衡。員文此外並聲明，波茨坦協定第十四章，即關於德國經濟統一之章，應充分實行，又德國之佔領費用，在過去現在及將來，應由四强平均分担，佔領之支出應健先以德國之生產物償還。渠復主張使物資得在四區間自由交流，制定進出口計劃，而財政改革計劃應　速付諸施行，托辣斯應予解散，並由盟管會於本年七月一日以前，重訂供賠款用之工廠及配備。</p>
<h3>法閣決繼續勢政　四大政黨閣員　決全部留任</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿二日電〕賴瑪迪政府已因共產黨之妥協及急進黨之臨時改變意見而得以保全。共黨表示願保留內閣中之五共黨閣員，但在議會表決越南軍費時仍決定棄權，賴瑪迪對該一立塲已表示接受。急進黨先已通過着令內閣中之五急進黨閣員退出，以示不滿共產黨之態度，但臨時忽又決定取消退出內閣之決議。政治觀察家並不以此為良好之現象，彼等預料急進黨之反響，將使政府內部瘦痕，益見加深。蓋目前正值莫斯科外長會開會期間，而國內又面臨財政經濟之困難，故無一政黨願負促成政府危機之責。</p>
<p>共產黨議員杜格洛今日在國民議會中表示：共黨雖反對撥款以供與越盟作戰，但為保持內閣之團結起見，已令共黨閣員繼續供職，法國在目前時期，必須保持聯合政府之團結，以免妨碍法國在莫斯科會議中之努力，吾人深知我外長在莫斯科會議中，欲使會議接受法國之觀點，尤其是關於煤斤問題，已遭遇嚴重之困難云。</p>
<p>又悉：法國聯合政府四大黨中之其餘兩大黨，亦均議決贊成　續參加政府。</p>
<h3>新督蒞任伊始　印度又生事故</h3>
<p>魏菲爾　印飛倫敦</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里廿三日電〕回敎徒今日舉行「印回分治節」示威行動，與印度敎徒發生衝突，警察被迫開槍彈壓，並實施戒嚴。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里廿三日電〕卸任印督華維爾，今日偕夫人離此返倫敦，印督　特巴頓等均在機塲歡送。</p>
<h3>世界第七大洲　南極處女地　合衆通訊社稿　本報編譯室譯</h3>
<p>南極洲，這二十世紀的探險勝地，自從李溫斯敦探險非洲和裴利發見北極以來，沒有一處未探發的地方更引起人們的住意了。</p>
<p>世界第七大洲南極洲是最後發見的大陸，也是從未有過永久性的殖民地的唯一大陸。正式或非正式要求領有該大陸某一部分土地的國家當在一打以上。正式宣佈在南極洲有利害關係的，只有西半球的兩個國家，即阿根廷和智利。第三個國家美國，已經表示不承認他國的領土要求，同時美國自己是否將提出領土要求，尚在考慮中。</p>
<p>所有南極洲被要求的領土都是楔形的，其頂點都在南極，大多數地方曾經一度豎立過某些國家的國旗。這新世界中國家的分佈情形大略如左：</p>
<p>阿根廷要求福克蘭羣島</p>
<p>阿根廷曾經宣佈在所謂福克蘭羣島屬地握有主櫂，同時英國也自稱在該處握有主權。該處位於西經二十度至八十度之間，包括格累海姆地半島及威德爾海的大部分。自一九〇二年以來，阿格廷在南奧克尼羣島設有測候站。此外，阿根廷海軍官蘇勃拉爾會於一九〇一至一九〇四年間偕同瑞典探險家挪頓斯古爾深入格累海姆地探險，卒於一九〇四年被阿根廷巡洋艦「烏拉圭」號所發見。阿根廷就根據這理由主張該處應屬於阿根廷。此外阿根廷雖尚提出其他理由，但是都缺乏有力的根據。</p>
<p>新近成立的阿根廷南極洲委員會主席羅薩曾謂阿根廷密邇南極洲，故有提出領土要求的權利。貝隆總統在一九四六年十月九日的大總統命令內，根據南極洲沙洲和阿根廷接壤的理由，要求在南極洲佔有一部分土地。除了智利以外，沒有一國政府承認阿根廷的此項要求。</p>
<p>阿根廷於本年一月初第一次派遣探險隊前往南極洲，有智利觀察家同往</p>
<p>智利對南極一向極開心</p>
<p>智利所要求的領土和阿根廷及英國所要求的領土互相重疊，但又有一部分土地並未員任何國家所要求過，該地區位於西經五十三度至西經九十度之間，亦包括格累海姆地大部分和尚未探發的土地。</p>
<p>據一九四六年十二月十四日智利外交部發表聲明稱：根據（一）在過去一百年間，智利的捕鯨船和捕海豹船常出沒於該地附近海面，（二）該地區接近智利國境，以及歷史的，地理的，法律的，外交的及行政上的理由，智利有領有該地的權利。</p>
<p>智利探險隊於本年一月十五日出發前往南極區，有阿根廷覲察家三人同行。智利一般民衆現對南極問題極為關心。</p>
<p>美控險活動有悠久歷史</p>
<p>此外，關心南極地的西半球第三個國家便是美國。美國的探險家在南極地活動雖已有一百零七年歷史，但至今還沒有正式提出過任何領土要求。</p>
<p>許多英國航海家雖曾航行過南冰洋，並知道南極洲的存在，但直到一八四〇年方　有美國尉爾克斯海軍上尉在東經一百三十五度左近發見了南極湘。</p>
<p>此後若干年中美國始終保持了主要捕鯨國的優越地位，美國的船隻曾屢次突破南冰洋的大冰塊。多數美國人曾經參加外國的南極探險家，但是眞正的探險工作，直到一九二〇年方纔開始，那時澳洲的威爾金斯和美國的柏爾特海軍少將曾作過多次著名的飛行，包括一九二九年柏爾特越過南極的這次飛行在內。</p>
<p>美國探險家柏爾特少將</p>
<p>柏爾特發見瑪麗柏爾特地後，主張該處應歸美國領有，但是國會不予批准，後來愛爾斯華斯初次從格累海姆地至小亞美利加作橫渡南冰洋飛行，可是他的領土要求同樣被擱置起來。</p>
<p>假如美國要求南極洲的任何土地，大概是在西經九十度至一百五十度之間，這一段土地至今還沒有一個國家要求過。</p>
<p>最近柏爾特探險滕所發見的無冰區域（長四十哩）是在經度一百零一度諾克斯地附近的澳洲部分，它的重要性或許會與日俱增，很可能成為長期探測的根據地。</p>
<p>三個無冰區最值得注意</p>
<p>值得注意的是：這是南極洲已被發見的第三個無冰區域，顯然是受間歇溫泉的熱力而形成的。一九四一年德國飛行家曾發見兩處無冰地域，一處在威德爾海東岸的馬太皇太子妃地，一處在更東的阿斯特麗公主地，兩處都在南極洲與柏爾特發見地遙相對峙的另一邊。當時德國人祗攝取了幾張照片，可是並沒有實地探險，因為他們到那裏的目的是擄掠聯合國的捕鯨船，結果被捕去了十一艘。</p>
<h3>蘇格蘭　獨立運動　獲名流多人擁護</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿三日電〕頃悉：蘇格蘭國民黨昨夜在格拉斯哥召開會議，要求蘇格蘭自治，名流與會者有貴族多人及國會保守黨議員三人在內，其密　重大。按蘇格蘭之要求成為獨立邦，至少設立一蘇格闌獨立國會，並非新近之事，前已由少數國民黨份子一再提出，但未為多數蘇格蘭人所注意，緣彼等當時皆認為與英國聯合較諸獨立為有利故也。此一運動爲有勢力人所擁護，尙爲初次。</p>
<h3>墨發現大鈾鑛</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社墨西哥京城廿三日電〕據悉：墨國北部基霍華省（靠近美國邊界），已發現價值一億七千五百美萬元之鈾礦（原子彈材料）。先是附近一帶工人相率病倒，經專家檢騐後，確定乃受無綫電波輻射之故，當經進行調查，即發現大批優級鈾礦砂，其確實地點則未宣布。</p>
<h3>巴拉圭政府乞和　叛軍司令表示決不接受</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社亞松森廿三日電〕據此閒負責人士稱：巴拉圭政府今日已向叛軍求和，因莫里尼哥總統深恐戰爭擴大，南部各省亦將叛變。求和條件係忠於政府方面之三將領所提出，主張組織三頭臨時政府，由莫里尼哥總統為主席，叛軍騎兵司令賴馬斯上校亦為一頭，以拯救危局，叛軍方面或能接受此條件。</p>
<p>〔法國新開社阿根廷京城廿三日電〕巴拉圭叛軍司令維拉基亞今日在康塞浦與城向本計訪員談稱：吾人決不接受任何要求，亦不接見菓里尼　總統之任何代表，吾人將進兵京城亞松森，恢復人民之合法權利。革命運動之目的乃在推翻莫里尼哥在七年前所樹立之獨裁政權，復用被莫里尼哥所撒職之司令長宮，恢復人民之自由及保證各政黨之肖由活動。巴拉圭前臨時總統弗蘭哥上校自出亡烏拉圭後，頃亦已到達康塞浦興城，發表談話稱：余供政黨領袖，不擬領導革命運動。</p>
<h3>叛軍最後通牒　要求總統辭職</h3>
<p>〔合衆社阿根廷京城廿三日電〕據巴拉圭逃亡至此之人稱：巴拉圭叛軍領袖葛爾諾已發出最後通牒，內容共十一點，要求總統莫里尼哥立即辭職。彼等又稱：總統已派遣代表昂丁諾將軍范塞蒂上校二人赴叛軍總部談判和平。又聞葛爾愛諾告兩代表稱：渠將限總統在今日中午前答覆渠之條件，過時不覆，則一切談判，皆作罷論。</p>

<h3>民航界戰時船舶損失　籲請政府實踐賠償　要求賠償委會昨招待記者報告　定週內再度晉京請求</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕抗戰期間我國民營船舶或因被征用封港，或因在軍公運輸中損毀，或因被日本俘虜，或因被敵人炸沉炸毀，損失甚巨。勝利後民航界組織民營船舶戰時損失要求賠償委員會，請求政府賠償，交涉多時　政府對賠償原則及金額業經行政院例會先後通過，但對實施辦法，延宕迄今，已一年三個月餘，仍杳無音訊，航商極感焦急。該要求賠償委員會常務委員兼總幹事鍾山道，定於週內晋京再向政府請求。</p>
<p>氏昨特招待新聞界提出呼籲，據談戰時民營船舶之損失計：（一）征用封港六十三艘，十一萬九千九百〇六噸。（二）在軍公運輸中損毀三十三艘，一萬五千九百八十一噸。（三）被日本俘虜六十七艘，十一萬一千〇〇六頓。（四）被敵人炸沉四十三艘，四萬九千三百五十七噸。上頃損失數字，要求賠償委員會於三十四年十二月十二日向政府提出，並建議恢復噸位辦法：（一）以噸賠噸。（二）作價賠頓。（三）担保國外訂購或訂造。</p>
<p>政院通過原則</p>
<p>三十五年二月二十六日經行政院例會通過原則：（一）凡作軍事征用充作阻塞工程及應征軍公差而為敵損毀之船舶，合於軍事征用法之規定者，應予賠償。（二）船隻噸數及折舊暨戰前幣值與鋼鐵木材之指數如何折算，由交通部迅擬意見呈核。（三）航商向國外訂購船隻，政府應予以便利。（四）航商貸款可逕向四聯總處治辦。委員會當即根據此項原則，按照上海市政府三十五年三月份公佈之金屬類建築材料兩項指數計算，當時匯率一二〇〇元，折合總數的為美金一千萬元，並與交通部屢經治商，呈請行政院，於三十五年九月十日第七五八决例會通過，以美金三百六十萬元賠償，並令交通部與航商會商決定賠償金支付應用辦法。</p>
<p>商決賠償辦法</p>
<p>其辦法經委員會於該年十月三十日擬定，要點為：（一）恢復征用損失船舶十二萬噸，平均以每噸美金一百元計，的合美金一千二百萬元，除政府賠償美金三百六十萬元外，其餘不足數額，由政府貸款或担保，俾向國外訂購改造。（二）政府祖保或貸款部份之金額，以將來向日本取得之賠償船舶作為保證。但此項呈文於去年十月三十日分呈院部後，迄今猶未蒙批復，因此戰前航商尚有三十餘家未能復業。在此各國政府重視海洋航業，我國民航亟待發展之時，亟望政府能於最近期內，從速具體實施，使已屬定案而受損航商日夜焦念中之船舶賠償案，能早得一妥善結束。</p>
<h3>後方工廠復員協會　招待參觀四工廠　因受煤電限制產量大受影響</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕後方工廠復員協會，以後方各中小工廠，戰時供應軍需民用，不無相當勞績，勝利後桌返上海，數經請求，呈准行政院將標賣二次未脫售之敵偽工廠予以承購承租，第一批已於去平九月中旬辦理購租手續，然其　可復工者僅十餘家，多以接收後停頓年餘，莫不凌亂銹損，復以燃料·電力·資金·廠方等限制，未能全都正式復工。第二批遲至今年二月舉行，迄今尚未核定實行。該會為使各界明瞭各廠現况，昨日下午邀請本市新聞界前往各廠參觀。本市敎誠小學師生三十餘人，亦隨往參觀，由該會總幹事謝天聲引導，因時間所限，僅參觀上海紙廠，上海大禾實業工廠，永安電磁廠及上海啓文機器廠等四廠。其中上海紙廠尚未復工。據謝氏稱：該廠所有毛氈十二條，銅絲布廿一塊，紙漿六十餘噸，均為國營江南造紙廠調配，廠方及接電問題，未獲解決，致今日仍未復工。當此紙荒嚴重聲中，一仍機器銹損，荒置不用，殊為可惜。該廠有製漿蒸球及製紙車二全套，現均露銹損，置於廠房中，復工後月可出紙三百噸。其他已復工之三廠，大禾實業廠爲滬上唯一專製石棉瓦者，佔地四十餘畝，規模甚大，現在每月出產三尺七寸長，二分厚之石棉瓦六百張。永安電磁廠，戰時與中央電磁廠，為西南僅有之兩家電磁廠，勝利後返滬，因受煤電供應之限制，不能大事生產，乃於江西浮梁開設分廠，產品運銷東南，惟以運費高昂，收支不敷甚鉅。上海啓文機器廠，專製號碼機，亦因白畫限制用電，產量大受影響。</p>

<h3>龍華機塲跑道　五月間可完成　全部經費九十億　設備爲全國之冠</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕交通部龍華機塲，長六千呎，寬一百五十呎之南北跑道工程，自於去年十二月開工，本年二月初開始舖築石子路基，迄今石子路基已大部完成，混凝土路面，則完成五分之一，即六十塊（每塊長一百二十呎，寬二十五呎，每日可完成六塊，），全部工程預計於五月中可完成，將為全國最長最完備之跑道。</p>
<p>該跑道不僅特別寬長，且可載重四十五噸，以符合星座式飛機重量之標準。跑道厚度為十一吋二分，縫接處加厚為十四吋六分，共需用水泥的一萬二千噸，沙一萬七千噸，石子七萬噸，但目前石子的尚差三萬噸，為該工程最感困難者。</p>
<p>所雇工人　總計二千</p>
<p>跑道工程全部經費估計爲九十億元，由交通部單獨撥給，已須到八十七億元。據該處工程師表示：此數當可有餘，餘款擬用為建築道旁停機道之用。工程分北。中。南三段，分別由保華建築公司，陶桂記營造廠，及中聯工程公司承包。</p>

<h3>總工會請規定　工人最低工資</h3>
<p>市總工會近因少數廠商發給工資，往往過份苛刻，致糾紛時起，該會有飛於此，於日前呈請本市勞資評斷委員會，要求訂定最低工資標準，以安工人生活。原文略謂「本市各業工友工資」，其底薪標準，大部業已調整，但有少數，仍依照舊有習慣，待遇過份苛刻，不合最低標準，且有同一工作，底薪各有不同，殊欠公允，使工友無法維特最低生活，以致時有糾紛發生，若不速予設法解決，來日紛爭，勢必無法消弭」云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕上海郵務工會，在武昌路所建之新會址，於昨日上午九時舉行落成典禮，到各界來賓及工界人士一千餘人。由上海郵政局李進祿局長揭幕，王鳳賽剪彩。並有摸彩，平劇，話劇，淸唱，找術表演等節目助興。該會址設有醫藥室，理髮室，音樂室，中西餐室，宿舍及富麗堂　之大禮堂。</p>
<h3>候審室牆壁　刻畫的圖案　顯示出囚犯內凡的焦急苦悶</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕一個囚犯在受審之前的焦急，不安和神經極度的緊張，就是他在平日是理智極堅强最能鎭靜的人，也不能避免。殺人越貨的大盜，慣竊小偷，和犯有傷害詐欺罪的囚徒們，當擠在一小間候審室中的時候，大都面壁相向，沉患不語，或仰首出神，喃喃不休。也有拚命咬自己的袖口或衣角，也有下意識的拍弄牆上的泥灰。總之從來沒有聽見過候審室中傳出哭笑聲，當然更不會有高談闊論。他們都專心一意的為自己打算，絕不想知應他大的案情。平日在監獄中，時常要呌駡吵鬧，最不易管束的犯人，在候審室中，也都安靜異常。有經騐的司法警察都知道這一點，於是他們一致認為看管候審室是件最輕鬆，最不會出亂子的工作。</p>
<p>北浙江路地方法院的刑事法庭，都附有一間候審室，讓由看守所提來的犯人，在此中休息，等候受審。那是一間並不寬大的房間，門上開一個小洞，窗上裝着鐵柵，牆壁和天花板一律刷成黑色。我想不透一定要用黑色的原理，但這裏的過客，在侷促不安的心緒下，正好利用它當做黑板，拕出牆上的泥灰，在牆上亂塗，以消磨他們最冗長，最不耐煩的時間。這樣也可以發洩他們的焦灼的情緒，鬆弛過度緊張的神經。他們的作品，除了「王阿根你好命苦呀」！「今日進得此間來……」之類不倫不類詞句外，餘都是不規則的錢條圖案畫。從這種壁畫上，明顯地告訴出候審中的囚犯們的心情，是如何焦躁不甯，是如何苦悶。惡劣的情緒，增加了他們的破壞性。一批一批犯人進去出來，使黑牆上一顆一顆的洞眼，和醜惡的壁畫，不斷地增多，不斷地擴大。</p>
<p>以前在首都高院的候審室中，記者曾與現已執行槍決的林逆柏生談過話。他雖然裝着鎭靜的笑臉，但兩頰的肌肉不住地在抽動。老牌漢奸殷汝耕在候審室中瘋狂地揮着扇子，而那天的天氣並不太熟。「四大名山」竊犯劉航俠，在庭上侃侃而談一套供詞，是在候審室中，向着牆角編成的。「洋老虎」梅斯伯，在候審室中喃喃自語，確像患着神經衰弱症。這些羣像，確是大有可觀，可是法警們却從不肯向裏面多張望一回，他們已司空見慣了。</p>
<h3>明日美術節　兩大展覽會</h3>

<p>〔本報訊〕輸管會限額分配處對本年二月至四月之羊毛輸入限額，業已規定爲美金一百四十萬元，該項羊毛，且已包括羊毛，毛條，毛紗三種在內。而分配對象，則又包括全國中外國民營毛紡廠在內。故限額分配結果，尙不足全國各廠需要量十分之一。全國中外毛紡界，有鑒及斯，特於日前下午四時，在本市毛紡業公會，成立羊毛類原料分配委員會。到程年彭，唐君遠，唐偉章，吳善賡，陳元慶，勞勃生，凱世威等十五人。討論經過，決定：（一）關於原料分配，擬調查各廠實際開工之需要量，俾便根據供給原料。據調查：全國天津，蘭州，上海，重慶等地毛紡廠，共約八十家（滬佔五十餘家）。現因精紡原料，需要羊毛，粗紡原料，需要毛條，織機則需毛紗，而毛紗寶係毛條與羊毛最後之產品，故一百四十萬元之限額，將根據該項關係，而定配給之優先次序。（二）需要量之規定，精紡錠以十小時工作爲準，每錠需毛條〇·四磅。粗紡錠需〇·六磅。紡絨綫錠需一·五磅。（三）決定四十五支毛條每磅扯價作五十五便士計，六十四支毛條作一二五便士計，六十支洗清羊毛作六〇便士計。各廠所需外匯，可根據該項數額折算美匯云。</p>
<h3>太原物價下跌</h3>
<p>〔本報太原廿二日電〕經濟緊急措施法案公佈後，幷市物價即入平疲冬眠狀態。經十九日延安及晋西要隘孝義收復之打擊，人心虛怯，連日下瀉，商人無不疾首蹙額，嘆難維持日用及應出負擔。金珠業尤為悽慘，金飾因條金暗盤高於牌價，無法售賣，條金買賣又因嚴禁無正式行市，只售銀飾，購者稀微。廿六家中已有半數以上呈請歇業，其餘亦在考慮是否歇業或改業中。</p>
<h3>中華菸草公司　一年來槪况</h3>
<p>最高產量每月八千箱</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中華菸草公司自去年一月九日奉命成立，同月十一日開工迄今，業已經年。該公司現共有三廠，一二兩廠每廠有捲菸機廿五部，月可產菸三千五百箱。第三廠有捲菸機十五部。該廠係屬實騐性質，產量每月有二千餘箱。據悉：該公司每月最高之生產量，可達一萬箱。惟因日人經營時期，對葉子捲菸等各部門設施，未能平衡化，故接收後忙於整頓，最高產量每月的爲八千箱。去年全年生產總額，計五五，三三六箱。銷售總額，計五三，五三四箱。銷區以上海佔多數，計一六，四四〇箱半。其他各埠包括鄂·浙·京滬·滬杭綫·湘·皖·豫·陝·甘·靑島·川·滇·黔等，亦佔三七，〇九三箱半。銷售金額，計二三，七四八，一四五，〇〇〇元。該公司目前以全部資產估值，約值三百十八億元。出品有雙斧·全　·指南三種。該公司成立之初，爲避免與民爭利，特設置顧問委員會，延聘顧少卿（　成）　兆祁（南洋），A　S.　Grew（頤中），張茲　·郭可洗（經濟部）等爲委員，俾對公司業務，多所建議云。</p>
<h3>染織業呈請輪管會　核定需要原料限額</h3>
<p>染織業同業公會，頃以同業需要染料及化學藥品，極爲殷切。自輸入管理以來，該項貨物，日見减少，執貨者居奇操縱，市價暴漲，影響生產，增重成本，頗使工業難以維持。此項輸入物品，輸管會限額分配處，前僅核定二至四月份輸入限額，於撙節外匯之中，微寓維護工業之意，對整個數量，尙無規定。現該公會以染織業爲民族工業之一，需要原料，輸入限額，如無明確規定，則各工廠將無法以圖生存。爰特調查每月需要種類數量，擬具理由，請求輸管會迅予確定限額分配，茲列理由曁需要品名如次：</p>
<p>關於染料及化學藥品，爲本會各會員廠染色印花整理工程所必需，用量實佔其他工業百分之八十以上。過去自由輸入時期，同業均向進口商直接訂購，因來源暢達，採用尙無困難。自輸入限制以來，滬上存底日薄，而實銷反旺，致執貨者居有抬價，使同業營業範圍，大受控制，似此措施，當非政府扶植民族工業之本旨。此項主要原料，如再任其延宕，不加確定，則同業所需，仍掌握於進口商之手，我染織工業寗有瞧類。茲本市捲烟工業，毛紡工業，所用烟葉·羊毛·貴會已經規定輸入限額，按照各廠每月生產量，分別核定其受配量，通知各廠逕與進口商簽訂合同契的，經限額分配處審核後，簽發輸人許可證，此項措置極爲適當，旣可避免藉口居奇之弊，並且减輕工業產品成本。現本會各會員廠，所需上項原料，應請一視同仁，援例辦理。爰特編具每月需要原料，種類數量，送請迅予核定，懇將限額轉由公會，依照各廠產量分別配給。所需原料名稱如次：（染料）硫化元·士林藍附海昌藍·納夫妥AS·納夫妥鹽及培司·直接染料附鹽基·硫化染料。（原料化學品）燒碱·純碱·硫酸·鹽酸·硫化碱·漂白粉·保險粉·冰　酸·過硼酸鈉·亞硝酸鈉·氣酸鈉·紅礬納·阿尼林油。</p>
<h3>羊毛到銷兩量</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕羊毛到貨甚多，行商乘多吸購出口，交易至爲熱鬧。山東羊毛，每祖五萬元，湖州羊毛，每担上等貨十二三萬元，中等貨十一萬元，均爲成交價格？</p>
<h3>工業原料下游</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工業原料，平疲已近一月，吸胃仍難好轉，價格　續下游。國外定貨，美貨出口限制較前更甚，據市塲傳聞，若干工廠，大多頭寸爲某種貴重物品等所積壓，而難以忍痛斬割，故原料不但無進吸可能，抑且反將舊存原料，向原料市塲出售者。昨市燒碱（美貨）已跌至每桶三百六十萬元，出能貨亦多，尙有下跌之勢。保險粉度每担漲至二百萬元，現價八十萬已可買到。純碱銷量亦微，甘油，司的令，銷季已過，市價尙難站定，鋅養粉以橡膠廠及油漆工業尙有去化，價仍屹立於每噸千萬之高價。硫酸铔已頻銷令，價看軒昂。</p>
<h3>中樞研討如何利用　日首批賠償物資　我國可獲得一百卅五萬噸</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕日本首批賠償數額及其分配，短期中即可決定，我國將獲得一百三十五萬噸。第一次將先搬運四十萬噸，利用此筆賠償物資之預算，中樞研討已久，但截至宋　長辭職時爲止，尙未作最後決定。據云其中規定運費爲六百億。安裝費爲三千億。實局決心使首批物資之利用，能有良好之成績，使以後討論總賠償時，我國能處於有利之地位。物資之運輸不成問題，因難在於利用。據某專家之估計，利用之經費需在運費二十倍以上；將來總賠償執行時，我國最少可得三百萬噸物資，如包括輕工業在內，爲數更大；故有關當局現正絞盡腦汁，多方設法，籌措此筆基金。</p>
<p>舊批拆遷之賠償物資，爲賠償總額內之百分之三十，去年八月時即已有此決定。關於賠償程序之執行，盟軍總部內之科學經濟組與外物保管組最初頗有爭執，現已規定由前者擔任設計與分配，後者擔任執行之責，而由總部下之副參謀長主持。首批拆遷物資中，不包括交通·礦業·輕工業在內，事實上麥帥總部相當鼓勵日本紡織及造船業之恢復。例如去年春季，總部即會邀請英印代表考察日本之紡織業，並主張日本應維持三百五十萬錠之生產力。以船隻而言，日本現有海輪一百萬噸，但總部希望日本能有三百萬噸，並多方設法鼓勵其恢復造船業。以日本之現有設備計算，每年至少可造三十五萬噸。</p>
<p>日本之總賠償問題，內容並不單純，現尙未加討論。賠償之中心問題，爲確定何年爲執行賠償後日本應有之生活水準。我國代表團主張一九一四年與一九二〇年，但美方持不同之見解，將來可能確定於一九三〇至一九三四年之間。愈後則生產力愈大，對日本爲愈有利。盟軍總部之觀點有二：（一）希望日本能成爲一自足自給之國家，（二）希望日本能負擔　　軍之費用，因此對賠償之執行，力主寬大云</p>
<h3>聯總績發漁輪　十五艘將抵華</h3>
<p>聯總爲扶助我國復興漁業，已獲予我國新式漁船八十三艘，由行總代爲負實管理經營。該項船隻，在籌備出租中。昨日行總又　聯總電稱：聯總方面尙有三十六艘新式漁輪，可撥予我國運爾。最近由總署長魯克斯將軍核准，先撥予我國十五艘，現已啓程來華，不日即可抵達。其餘之二十一艘，將於今夏絡續前來云。</p>
<h3>四千萬船舶貸款　美對華重開談判　可購海輪一五九艘</h3>
<p>據航業界確息：久懸未決之美對華四千萬美元船舶貸款，現又舊調重彈，恢復談判。該項四千萬元美金，將可購買大小海輪一百五十九艘，計八十一萬噸。其中包括萬噸以上海輪卅二艘，五千噸以上者廿餘艘，餘均爲三千噸以上者。此項談判於四月底前即可正式確定。若此項船舶一經來華，則國內客貨運好可統籌運用而有餘。航業界現正擬以此項船舶籌組一聯合公司，俾得妥加運用，開闢國內外航綫，確立中國在國際航業界之地位。將採取日本航業戰前在國際之地位而代之云。</p>
<h3>中國鹽業公司成立　由東北華北兩公司合併改組　本年度共可產鹽九百餘萬擔</h3>
<p>敵寇東北鹽業公司，華北鹽業公司，財政部派員接收，業已竣事。特將兩機構併組爲中國鹽業公司，由姚元綸任總經理。爲便利業務之推進起見，決在華北東北靑島台灣等處設四個分公司。華北設天津，東北設瀋陽，正積極籌備中。頃悉前華北鹽業公司所轄之鹽田面積，大沽爲九六〇〇〇畝，塘沽爲三四五六〇畝，漢沽爲五二三二〇畝，大淸河爲一一〇七〇四畝，共計二九三五八四畝。除大淸河鹽田因治安未靖，暫無法復晒外，其餘鹽田擬全部開晒。華北鹽田之特點，（一）大沽鹽田，業已全部常化，利用電力汲水。（二）其餘鹽田，亦均爲幅圓廣闊之整塊土地，汲水設備優良，本年度產額可能爲七百苗擔，的佔長蘆之半。至東北鹽業公司所有之鹽田面積，計綏　塲區爲四八五一二畝，營蓋塲區爲一二五七六〇畝，復縣塲區爲六五七九二畝，莊河塲區爲一〇六二四畝，金州塲區爲二五二〇〇畝合計五〇一八八八畝。除金州塲區仍由共軍盤據外，其餘鹽田均擬加以修復，逐步開晒。以上鹽田，均係利用電氣推滷，如能全部恢復，年產鹽額爲二千萬擔。本年度復舊伊始，可產二百五十萬擔。以上兩家公司所產鹽斤，百分之六十輸日，其餘運銷國內，調劑民食。</p>
<h3>湘錳粉到銷旺</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕湘產錳粉品質甚佳，頗合工業需要，太年到貨頗多，銷路亦廣。上年以運輸情形惡劣，每噸運滬價格須佔五分之一，本年情形略好，故今後或可源源運到。現價每噸最好者爲二百萬元，較次者自一百四十萬至一百六十萬元，每噸運費的佔八十萬元左右，價較（上等貨）上年每噸六十萬元，亦上漲一二倍之間。</p>
<h3>黃狼皮俏硬　滬鬃脚地堅</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕黃狼皮歐洲傳來緊俏聲，猶商奮力搜購，市價愈趨堅俏。昨市每對價爲三萬七千元，獾皮　皮亦跟蹤趨漲，紐約黃狼皮市况仍軟，十八吋價爲二元五角美金，十四吋爲一元一角五分美金。滬鬃以存底枯竭，紐約市俏，出口商頻補拋貨，脚地仍堅。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕湖羊皮昨市爲每隻一萬一千元。據悉：紐約市價爲美金一元二角五分，出口有利，成交亦多。</p>
<h3>捲菸業不景氣</h3>
<p>勞資集商擔救辦法</p>
<p>本市工商業不景氣聲中，捲菸業之危機已趨尖銳化，即外商烟廠，亦無法挽此狂瀾。除外商最大之頤中菸廠已全部停工外，國貨廠商中，華成烟公司，素稱烟業之巨擘，亦已實行减工，每日僅開工五小時，一部份捲菸工廠則紛紛裁員，以資茍延殘喘。若干小型烟廠，每日僅開工兩小時，實際上已陷八停頓狀態。故此一惡化現　，如無對策挽救，失業工人之數字，更將大見增加。聞生產促進會已定今日召集捲菸業勞資雙方商討挽救辦法云。</p>
<h3>汕頭抽鈔工業　復業者三萬餘人</h3>
<p>汕頭抽紗爲廣東特產之一，係以細布抽出紗綫，織出種種花紋，製成手帕桌布床布睡衣等，輸往歐美。因其爲手工精製，極受歡迎，行銷甚廣。戰前粵實潮屬，以此爲生者達四十餘萬人。戰時因流亡輾轉，及今復業者僅得三萬餘人。依據廿九年統計，年產量約值八千餘萬元（美金二百萬，）以時値伸算，的一百六十七億。惟本年產額當不能超過四十二億，加以目前原料昂貴，外商操縱，當地政府會擬獎勵出口辦法，迄未收効。戰前抽紗，多採用舶來亞麻布，近以成本過高，多採當地出產之夏布。過去圖案多守成法，缺乏美術價値，如能改革，及由政府輔導，改良品質，每年增加收入，當甚可觀。</p>
<h3>銀樓業收兌及製造收金飾　財政部公布新管理辦法</h3>

<h3>國防鐵柵　工業筋骨　鞍山鋼鐵治煉城</h3>
<p>— 深瀋陽三月十五日航訊　本報東北特派員韓清濤</p>
<p>鞍山的鋼鐵事業，是中國國防部的鐵柵，工業的筋骨，更關連着中國整個的經濟前途，中央對於它越發加重了重視的程度，最近不斷的調查，加强它的重建和生產能力，都是很好的例證。</p>
<p>記者爲了要把實際情况報導在國人的面前，特地從瀋陽跑到鞍山，參觀了三天。三天的光陰，並沒能很窺全豹，規模是够大了，當記者踏進鍊鋼廠的時候，第一眼看到的是冒着氣的起重機，來往吼呌着，起卸鍊鐵爐旁破壞的笨重物品，好多的工人，站在兩個可能修復的鍊鐵爐上，捶　。電焊，「叮咚」，「匡湯」，饗成一片。</p>
<p>鍊鋼廠內的半空，橫跑着龐大的電動起重機，在搬運或淸除什物，轟隆轟隆的聲音，震動耳鼓，一個小型的軋鋼廠，燒了好多半成品的鋼條，一條紅鋼鈎出，順着動轉的輪軸，鑽惟了軋鋼機，進去，出來，再進去成了一條長蛇，再順着輪軸又進入了幾座排立的軋鋼機，熟練的工人，快速的手法，軋成了所要的形狀，記者參觀的時候，正在軋着建築物上所用的鋼筋。</p>
<p>機器廠裏，左一排右一排的車床，正在鏇火車軸，另一個廠裏，一個一噸半和幾個更大的汽軋，在棰車軸，崩冬崩冬的，把鋼鐵捶細密了，捶牢實了，然後送到車床工廠去。</p>
<p>一個鐵翻砂廠，有電動機，在抓着一個大鐵鍋，鍋裏盛着一鍋鐵漿汁，由着滑車左右牽動，傾倒鐵汁，製造車輪和掛鈎，工作是相常緊張繁忙的。</p>
<p>鋼鐵公司，現在有採鑛，選鑛，製鐵，化工，製鋼，軋鋼，動力，運輸，工作，重工業等十個部門，擁有弓長岑，櫻桃園，大孤山等採鑛所，選鑛部門裏，有還元，選鑛，中鑛，燒結，團鑛等工塲，製鐵部門裏，有生鐵，粒鐵等工塲，化工部門裏，有洗煤，焦炭，吸氣，瀝靑，硫酸，徧蘇油，硫酸铔等工塲。</p>
<p>製鋼的部門，含有製鋼和鐵合金工塲，軋鋼的部門，含有分塊，大形，第一，二小形，中板，薄板等工塲，動力部門有動力工塲，重工業部門有原爲「大谷重工業株式會社」中型鋼板工塲，鑄鐵工塲，鑄鋼工塲，機械工塲，冷作工塲，氧氣製造工塲，分析所，建築工事用機器部份，以及變電設備等，眞是洋洋大觀呢！</p>
<p>在這些部門裏，有的是無法修復的，那要等待日本賠償的機構和設備，據邵總經理逸周說：「日本的賠償，東北可佔全國分配額五分之一，鞍山可得七萬五千噸，最要緊急需約有四萬五千噸，其餘次要約有三萬噸，可分　急的運到鞍山來」！</p>
<p>能修復的，已徑開始工作，開始在動，電力，火力，汽力，人力，攪成一片，一切爲了重建，爲了復工，到處顯示着有光芒的前途！</p>
<p>製鐵煉鋼工作</p>
<p>鍊鐵廠原有鍊鐵爐九座，除了拆走和破壞的以外，擬定修復第一和第二兩爐（爐日產四百噸），以及附帶的一切設備，規格能力爲年產二十八萬噸。</p>
<p>近巳監督拆修，關於各該爐殘破部份的淸除工作，歷時月餘，頃已大部完成，現正進行修裝工作。</p>
<p>煉鋼部門，擬定修復平爐三座，並預備精煉爐和混鐵爐，以及附帶的一切設備，規格能力爲年產鋼錠二十七萬噸，又爲了補助瓦斯的不敷用，另新按裝煤氣爐四座。</p>
<p>軋鋼部門，擬定修復分塊軋鋼機，第一小型鋼材軋鋼機，第二鑄造廠的中型鋼板軋鋼機，以及附帶的一切設備，規格能力年產鋼塊五十萬噸，修復後，可年產中型鋼材十萬噸，小型鋼材七萬噸，中鋼板三萬噸。</p>
<p>邵逸周說：「現在小型軋鋼部門，已經開工多時，日人所存的半成品—鋼塊，此項存儲，可以用至五月底，鍊鋼部份，六月可開工，可以使軋鋼部門維持工作到八月底，那時第一架每天可出四百噸較小的鍊鐵爐，能够修復，開始煉鐵，那麽煉鋼廠也可繼續，軋鋼廠，更可無無料之憂了！」</p>
<p>貧礦處理成功</p>
<p>鞍山鋼　廠，對於貧礦的利用，是一大特點，在經濟觀點上說，貧礦處理手續多，成本或者是大一點，但因富礦坑道採掘等工費多，貧礦則省工，像鞍山以南的大孤山礦場，貧礦發掘即是，結果貧富礦所費，幾乎相等，所以日人曾對世界誇耀他們所用的「鞍山式貧礦處理法」的成功。</p>
<p>選礦廠，是處理貧礦的大本營，處理的步驟，是粉碎礦石，成爲粉狀，磁石吸收了鐵質粉，再將集中的磁鐵粉，燒成礦石，結果是用人力把貧礦變成了富礦。</p>
<p>可惜的是選鐵廠裹的機器，因爲破壞殆盡，大部份機件須仰給於國外，加以瓦斯不足，修復需時較長，所以現時僅限於整理和保管工作。</p>
<p>在選礦廠未修復以前，第一期計劃煉鐵需用原料，由弓長嶺，櫻桃園（在鞍山東北方，）和小房身等礦山，生產品質優良的鐵礦供應，弓長嶺採礦量，計劃年產四十五萬噸，（煉鐵和平爐用），因爲煉鐵爐用鐵礦的尺寸爲五〇至一〇耗，因而對該礦注重修復採礦的碎礦設備。</p>
<p>附帶出產的粉礦，擬修復選礦廠裏一部份的團礦廠，製成團礦，以供應煉鐵爐用途，螢石，錳礦，石灰石，白雲石，鎂石等，擬用存料，所以各礦暫不修復，，唯一級矽石，因現存不多，並需期較早，擬修復錦熱區和吉林區等各礦。</p>
<p>公司第一期計劃，除了修復煉鐵和煉鋼的必需一切設備，並採礦設備外，更由其他各中·小工廠中，核定所有存料量，和國內的需供情形，以及修復程度，又擬定了優先復工的一部份工廠。</p>
<p>煉焦工廠悲哀</p>
<p>煉焦廠，是一個規模很大的廠，盟國爲了促使日本早日投降B29式重轟炸機，曾幾次從成都飛到鞍山投彈，有些炸彈，落到了鐵道東，有些投中了煉焦廠的煉焦爐，煉焦爐曾經遭到了部份的破壞。</p>
<p>煉焦廠，負全部煉焦的重任，分由運煤，洗煤，焦爐等三廠執行，且設有副產部門，好將煤氣裏附產品收回，一面利用這項附產品，加工製造化工成品，又設煤氣事務所，以利用剩餘煤氣，供給鞍山市住民使用。</p>
<p>煉煤廠在接收以前，損失慘重，所有運煤和洗煤的設備，都已破壞，其他設備，如能修復，尙可恢復日產一千噸焦的生產量。</p>
<p>該廠業經分期擬就復工計劃；第一期復工計劃，目標係以年產塊焦二十五萬噸，粉焦五萬噸，並製附產化工成品，業自三十五年十月積極實施，預計本月即可分期開礦，規定開礦四個月後，完成第一期復工工作。</p>
<p>第二期復工計劃：該期係以年產焦五十萬噸和附產化工成品爲目標，預計一年完成，然後再開始第三期工作，第三期以年產二百萬噸焦和附產化工成品爲目標。</p>
<p>記者在煉焦廠裏參觀，走上煉焦爐，踏入化工室，傍靠冷却吸收塔，好像走在大森林，好像「劉佬佬走進大觀園，」覺得陰沉可怕，也覺得自己藐小，不住在盤問，熱心說明和引導我們的廠長和何先生。</p>
<p>煉鋼鐵的焦炭和煤氣，以及化工成品，完全仰仗在這個煉焦廠，可是東北運輸困難，過去，一晝夜，每兩小時就有一列煤車跑進來，現在廿小時也不見得有一列煤車來。</p>
<p>經過了資委會的一再請求，東北行轅也在盡着最大的努力，決定今年由撫順等塲，供給鞍山煉焦廠等處五十一萬噸塊煤，預計三月份可有三萬八千噸，四月份再多一點，五月份更多些，該廠在祈禱着運輸有辦法，不然的話，就一切都完了。</p>
<p>東北需要平穩，鞍山更要安定，在不安定中，重工業的工作，是沒法開展的，同時恐怕慘劇再演出，據鋼鐵公司負責人說：「若沒有去年五月共軍二次進入鞍山對鋼鐵工廠的破壞，那麽製鐵和煉鋼，早就可以開始，到了今天，必能有許多的成就，假如再有一决的破壞，那就一切不可收拾了！」</p>
<p>一切爲了工業</p>
<p>煉鐵廠的九座煉鐵爐，煉鋼廠排立的烟囱，煉焦廠的冷却吸收塔，電力廠的闊口冷却塔、高筒的煤氣儲藏罐，龐然大物，聳立雲霄，形成巨觀，平地，高岡，排列着大大小小不知多少的廠房建築物，佔有很大的面積，把旁處顯得異常貌小。</p>
<p>我們看到了圍繞鐵　和鞍山附近的鐵路，有的通達礦地，有的來去其他出產原料地點，起卸和裝運的叉路，更密如蛛網，如果把這些鋼鐵廠本身所有的鐵路銜接起來，計算總長，可有四百三十八公里，此外自有一百七十公里的電軍路綫，還未計算在內，廠面眞够偉大了。</p>
<p>白天，熱氣飛騰，黑烟繚繞，瀰浚空際，熔鐵爐流出來的鐵漿，紅光，熾烈，耀着火花，劃破了黑暗，偉大，美麗，動人！　鞍山東南，丘陵重疊，稍遠方有高高低低數不淸的山峯，那是遼南有名的「千山」名勝，西北一帶，是片一望無際的大平原，北臨古都遼陽，南有著名的「湯岡子」溫泉。</p>
<p>鞍山市是一個有名的重工業城市，市面情景，顯得特殊，很顯明的是一切爲了鋼鐵廠，市街裏主要的成份，是鋼鐵廠和其他工廠員工的住宅，此外還有爲了員工生息遊樂和醫療的機構。</p>
<p>一條中長路，劃成了東西兩個區域，在東的是鐵東區，西面的呌做鐵西區，鐵西區，除了空曠的地方有幾處日籍工人大住宅外，其餘的完全是我們同胞的住處和商店。</p>
<p>這個區域裏住民，除了工廠國人員工就是員工眷屬，此外是一些間接仰仗工廠員工生活的商販，有條東西寬的大街，通達西郊，另外還有許多縱橫街道，大致的說起來，還算整齊。</p>
<p>鋼鐵工業地帶</p>
<p>鐵西區，西北方是鋼鐵和其他重工業所在地，一塊土岡上，覆壓着幾列像走廊般的黑廠房，隨山起伏，成爲巨觀，那是選礦廠，世界有名的「鞍山式貧礦處理法，」就是在這裏處理的。</p>
<p>顧着柏油路往北走，一列白色的樓房橫住了去路，那就是住民所說的「白房子，」在前是昭和製鋼所的事務所，現在是資委會鋼鐵公司的辦公處了，過了白樓，轉灣就是鋼鐵廠九座煉鐵爐，像巨人般站在那裏，傍西是電力廠所在地，冷却塔和煤氣儲藏塔等，也是龐大的，一排烟囱後方，就是煉鋼塲，東西是煉焦塲，規模更大，建築是很特別的，所有工廠所用的焦炭和煤氣，都是這裏供應的。</p>
<p>再往北。各種重工業工廠林立，過去是鋼鐵廠外圍的工廠，現在完全包括在鋼鐵公司以內，一直延展到立山車站。</p>
<p>在通個區域裏，有火車和電車，同時也有汽車，連接每個很遠的地方，緊張，繁忙，現在沒有那樣便利。同時也沒有那樣緊張了。</p>

<p>鐵東區，是一個特殊地區，過去，在住在鐵西的同胞們眼裏看來，是高貴神秘的所在。因爲這裏是沒有我們同胞分的，日本人根本不許可我們同胞走進鐵東區來。</p>

<h3>看廣西這片乾淨土</h3>
<p>— 桂林八日航訊　本報記者梁小中</p>
<p>一連串的日子，這裏的天空陰沉得怕人，午夜時分，漫天的大風暴刮到人心寒慄，往往使人意味着太陽的毀滅，山崩，海嘯……。三月中了，還沒有看到樹木抽新芽，冬眠一塲的景物，誰知道甚麼時候會醒來？</p>
<p>國民黨廣西省黨部三全代會開幕，黃主席在施政報告中坦白地指陳：「廣西的一切重建工作，都只在計劃時期」。天災戰禍，使到，一切都落後了不知多少年。要計劃實現，天氣恢復，向上看要望天保佑莫再來一决災禍，望中樞多給兩個錢；向下看，要望老百姓受得了無比的苦痛，望官兒們少一點「上下其手」，便甚麼都有辦法。從政治的角度看去，廣西還不失是一個乾淨土，儘管再多兩個毛賊，也還如黃旭初先生說：『廣西沒有所謂「解放區」，便是政治安定的一個明證』。要保證這一個明證永遠是一個明證，省政府正在印行着一本無所不包的施政綱領，使人回憶起十年前高揭入雲的「建設廣西，復興中國」八個大字，然而，人民却深沉得多了！</p>
<p>劉特使蒞桂　談此行觀感</p>
<p>劉文島先生啣中樞命，來桂一行，除了享受到各種最高榮譽外，（本來廣西一年到頭便很難看到一兩個特任官蒞止，自無怪乎寖寖其盛），小居旬日，酬酢之餘，記者詢問對廣西的觀感，劉特使毫不猶豫地唸道：「廣西人勤儉有爲，活潑而有朝氣，社會秩序安定，且有賢明之領袖領導，前途必極光明！」再詢以一點對建設廣西的意見，劉氏一笑而道：「廣西已有極良好的建設計劃，無需再有意見」。海闊天空，使到廣西人聽後，也不禁興奮無比。而今，劉先生將乘機歸去，留在桂林小市民的心裏只有一個念頭，他們都在想：「中樞從此一定會更明白我們的苦辛」。</p>
<p>空運一里路　需美金八角</p>
<p>從地上扯到天上，廣西的天空可够熱鬧，行總空運大隊在桂林，柳州，　寗都設有站，搭客載貨，八角美金一里路，到南京得要一百數十萬，所以門市頗淸淡，現在正在改善，一改善後，飛來飛去人物增加，再冷靜的地方也會好一點的。</p>
<p>放限四看，覺得四面都彷彿有一種新的生命在等候成長，然而如何撥開雲霧見靑天，却還等待着有心人的努力。</p>

<h3>失業技工呼籲錄取</h3>
<p>編輯先生：我是一個失業的工人，今年二十二歲，江蘇無錫人。抗戰時隨胞兄逃往貴陽，有友人介紹入鹽局學習修理機械二年，在昆明華生公司服務修理二年，迨抗戰結束，即辭職返里。今悉公路局機械管訊處招生百名（一）初中畢業或能駕駛者，（二）初中畢業或高小畢業有修理經騐二年者，我對第二項認爲相符，當即報名，然投考日據局方云，須考英文代數，試問高小程度有此能力嗎？學習駕駛術是否必須如此嚴格？故籲請公路局顧全失業技工，放寬錄用途徑爲幸。（吳伯鉤）</p>

<h3>談聯總行總社會福利工作會議　並檢討行總過去一年急振與福利事業（上）</h3>
<p>— 劉德偉　詹德垕</p>
<p>前幾天行總聯總會同召開社會福利工作會議邀請社會部，全國社會處·局·全國性公私福利機構以及社會工作學教授參加，道二百位各方來的代表坦白的供獻出他們活鮮鮮的工作經騐，誠懇的共同討論今後工作的方針，與步驟，這舉動的確是我國社會福利工作界空前的盛舉，道會中有社會福利工作設計者，行政者，實地工作者以及學者，總之，他們是以增進人民福利爲自己的職業者，希望他們牢牢記着這職業是神聖的，在討論中決不要犯同行相妒的毛病，在這人民水深火熱的時候要如何珍重的不要使這次的會成爲一塲空空的熱鬧，而要他能產生一個劃時代的力量。</p>
<p>除了對這次會議寄予熱烈的希望外，我們要回顧看看行總的福利工作，這一年來給了我們一些什麽？這種工作普通分爲二大類：一爲直接救濟，一爲兒童及殘老福利。</p>
<p>所謂直接救濟就是無需任何代價或勞力而可獲得的救濟施振的範圍，自然是以收復區爲限，對象是貧苦難民。</p>
<p>辦理直接救濟工作當前最大的問題是對象的決定，在這個大多敷的人民，只有大窮與小窮之別的國家裏，你能說誰不需要救濟，淸寒的公教人員及文化界善於組織起來使壓力於各分署要求救濟，而貧苦的老百姓散漫而無組織，有需求而無表達的方法，所以在初期不免有更需項救濟的貧苦大衆反而沒得着救濟，總署如是不能不將以前所謂「貧苦人民」那對象縮小爲以下五種：（一）方經遺送回籍的難民（年靑力壯者返籍後受直接救濟以一月爲限），（二）貧苦寡婦及孤兒，（三）十六歲以下貧苦無依的兒童，（四）六十歲以上之貪苦無靠者，（五）貧苦而殘廢者，這五條是行總爲直接救濟的對象定下一個度量衡，它把貧窮的最底的一層水準劃出來了，這水準以下是非振不活的人，入說善門難開，越救越多，事實上是沒有救濟辦法以前需要救濟的人並不比現在少，只是沒有一個度量衡去把他們從一般民衆中分別出來，所以我們終日渾渾噩噩，不知我國老百姓已窮困到什麽程度，這度量街纔告訴我們說有若千民衆是在活的水平棧下着埀死的喘息。</p>
<p>這些人們貧苦的原因是國際的，政治的，社會的，而不是任何一個小我的主動，所以醫治他們貧困的責任在聯合國和政府的肩上，但當聯總物資停止的時候，是行總結束的日子，然而這水進下的人民的需要還仍存在，政府對他們的責任是無法避免的，我們深深的了解外來的帮助不可久靠，這已是政府將每年作巨大的預算爲全國人民統籌福利實施的時候了。</p>
<p>做直接救濟工作當前第二個大問題是如何去尋找及認識所定的對象，這方法有二種，一是自動的，一是被動的。前者是組織工作隊，各分署按照轄區災情的輕重地域的性質，組織若十工作隊，有駐點，固定，巡廻三種之分，這是分署採用最普遍的方式，現共有急振工作隊二百六十九隊，其中以湖南分署爲最多，計一百五十四隊，其餘各分署在四至廿五隊之間，工作隊發放物資以直接與難民爲原則，但我國地大人多，行總必需與地方上原有機關聯繫合作辦理，一爲行總節省人力財力，一爲增强地方永久機稱，所以地方公立私立社會服務團體及自治機構常被請參加工作或被邀組織地方救濟協會，關於申請，登記，審查，各項手續，因爲本地人熟習本地情形，多交由地方機構辦理，物資的發放則仍由工作隊負實此種辦法，行總不可說不煞費苦心。</p>
<p>在這種自動的方法中另有一種發放的方法，是我們大家都感覺興趣的，那就是在有些鄕村裏工作隊要求村莊裏的老百姓每戶派代表開會投票選舉那最需要救濟者的姓名，然後工作隊，按現有物資的數量配發給那些得票最多者，這方法是最公平，迅速，而直接的。</p>
<p>那種被動的方法，是將城市分成區，每區設個別申請救濟站，利用當地的社會局或處作中心登記站，以何聯繫而免重複，因爲地域遼闊，人才缺乏，對於需要救濟者在調查時難免不有疏漏的情形，或是發放物資的時期已過已無法受到救濟，所以設立個別救濟站爲人民個別直接來站申請，不要呈文，免進衙門，在蘇，浙，湘，粵，冀等分署都應用這方法給與個別的生活補助，或貸款購買農具以備自立更生，南京辦事處在目都與社會服務處，中央醫院社會服務部等機關合作，分區設立五個站，並調用金陵及金女大兩校選修社會個案工作課程的學生參加各站調查工作，這可說是中國政府機關第一次採用個案工作的方法。</p>
<p>（下篇明日續完）</p>
<p>唐山築城壕　長八公里　深四公尺</p>
<p>唐山爲冀東重鎭，工廠林立，扼北寗路之中心。勝利以來，共軍時擬襲擊，最近冀東綏靖區，爲謀唐山治安一勞永逸計，除成立城防司令部，嚴密監視共軍活動外，更計劃挖築環市城河，使共軍無法突擊偷襲。此一計劃經各方積極討論後，業於本月十五日實行，預計城河全長八公里，闊八公尺，深四公尺，引水入河，深二公尺。首批需十五萬工，動員全市各級民衆，包括各機關公教人員·學生·市民·工人·警察·每日輪流出工，至全部工程吿竣爲止。開工第一日，記者特趕往工地視察，唐市各軍政首長，均親蒞指揮，至中午，已挖成長六百公尺，深二尺之基礎一段，是日出工者的五千餘人。據主持者吿記者：此一工程約需二個月即可完工，從此唐市治安，更可泰然無處矣。</p>
<h3>福州無文化　書報業凋敝</h3>
<p>— 十二日福州訊　本報特派記者陳正予</p>
<p>兩週前因金潮的激盪，福州市塲非常混亂，一切物價呈旋風式暴漲，接着生活指歟的上昇，加上了外匯的提高，白報紙價格最高的時候漲到廿萬元，目前雖稍下挫，但亦需要十四五萬元，此外，工價亦趨上揚，福州書報業面臨着空前的危機。</p>
<p>福州現有日報六家，晚報一家，以往日出對開二張約有中央日報與福建時報，日出對開一張的有南方日報，正義報，民主報，四開一張約有粹報，閩海晚報。現在緊縮後，日出對開張牛約有中央日報與福建時報，餘僅能維持一張。行銷最大的如中央日報日銷五六千份，餘皆二二千份或千餘份不等。京滬各報在榕有銷路的如南京中央日報，上海申新，大公，東南，文匯等各報，中以申新，大公，東南擁有讀者較多，福州地方人士中不少爲本報十餘年來之老讀者，對於本報向具深刻之印象與良好之批評。</p>
<p>福州共有書店十三家，除了商務，世界等數家售賣教科書外，餘多代售上海版書刋，這個年頭，想看書的人，沒錢買書，有錢的人，根本不想到買書這回事，因此，書店裏看書的人多，買書的人少，每家書店賴拖賬過日，像規模校大的「致知」與歷史較久「立達」書店，每天營業收入僅二三萬元，長篇巨構的書籍定價過昂，無人過問，僅雜誌略銷一些，銷路好的推「文摘」，「世界智識」，「西風」。此外，「家」的雜誌銷路亦不差，大概大家都總藉「家」來溫暖吧。</p>
<p>論到出版事業，令吾人不禁感福州無文化之慨。戰時，設在永安的「改進出版社」，「立達書店」，「聯合編譯店」，爲東南文化的總匯。這些出版機關也的確萃集了不少人才，出過一些水準很高的文藝作品，對於東南戰區的文化有過不朽的業績，而今，人才勞燕紛飛，高物價窒息了出版業，　誌多巳停刋，僅有的如省立研究院出的福建農業，省教育應出的福建教育等數種，多屬泛泛之論，福州幾乎談不上出版了！</p>

<h3>我住在唐伯虎的故宅</h3>
<p>— 向培良</p>
<p>燕雁無心，太湖西畔逐覆去。數峯淸苦，商略黃昏雨。第四橋邊，欲共天隨住。今何許！憑欄懷古，　柳毿毿舞。（點絳唇二姜白石）。</p>
<p>雖然姜白石是在南宋，但那仍然是好的時代，可以遙望湖雲，目送雁燕，吟味著淸寂的黃昏，而神往於古代詩人：陸龜蒙的故宅，猶存彷彿於柳絲婀娜中。想來不會有孩子們的哭呌，捶錫箔的震撼，以及凄冷的小販之呼喚擾亂他的心思罷。</p>
<p>我如今是住在唐伯虎的故宅，一所零落的舊廟裹，蘇州桃花塢準提庵，我的隣居有十幾家，幾乎全部是捶錫箔的紹興人。雖然不大弄得淸他們的姓氏，却有着很好的友誼。這一個世界，並不如理想那麽好，却也不如宣傳的那麽壞。</p>
<p>這是一所有了四百多年歷史的房子，最早的紀年恰當哥侖布死前一年西曆一五零五，明孝宗弘治十八年乙丑，有唐伯虎的碑，房子的建築自然更在以前，原來的景像無從想像。寺僧告訴我從前庵的地址很大，前臨河，後面包塔影池（現在已經堙塞）和雙荷花池（這地名如今還存在），面積當在今日十倍以上。當年盛種桃花，所以稱為桃花塢。然而樹木裏面桃花最不長壽，沒有等到變成桑田的時候早已消化了。目前已成為幾條頗為冷落的街道</p>
<p>唐伯虎死以後，捨宅為寺，相轉不廢。這裏面祀有三位明代的賢人，最早的是金網，字子尚，明初任蘇州知府。明太祖因為蘇人為張士誠固守，餘怒不息，加以很重的賦稅。金網請求减賦，觸怒被殺。到宣宗朝，知府况　　奏請减賦得准。後人追念金　，為之立祠。現有同治八年楊象滲的碑記，但那一篇文字沒有說明從什麼時候起祀金知府在滬個屋子裏。</p>
<p>最晚的一位是明末復社的楊廷樞，字維斗，國亡殉節。現存楊忠節公畫像刻石，（忠節是友人私諡）有王　的象贊：「維南有斗，篤生偉人。讀聖賢書，為明忠臣，聿自諸生，首悍璫禍。解領陪都，名高復社。矯矯風節，最巖德容。東南夫子，蔚然儒宗。位微而彰，道一以貫，漢之林宗，晋之元晏。中原旣裂，慷慨撫躬。請纓志結，借箸謀工。甫遭陸沉，旋　鼎革。殺身成仁，從容不迫。象賢伯起，繼踵文山，輝暎千古，氣塞兩間。嵇紹衣紅，萇弘血碧。遺像同瞻，傳之無　」像贊作於康熙五十二年，距今也在二百年以外了。大的唐怕虎故宅改為寺廟以後，有些鄉賢，也便附祀在裏面，所以有金楊兩公約遺跡</p>
<p>唐伯虎的眞跡留有一研，刻他自己的長歌。原碑還在，但已太半漫沒，不大可讀。另有一道光年間翻刻的碑石，字跡和尺幅都全仿原碑。我在寒山寺所見文徵明書張繼楓橋夜泊詩，也漫沒太半，祗幾個字完好。鄧尉香雪海乾隆所題的碑，全部無一字可論。雖然是氣候潮濕，碑石容易剝落。但就在東南文物之邦，也還是沒有人保存古蹟，一切聽其自然消磨於無限風雨中，長　　如下：</p>
<p>松花塢　桃花太庵，桃花庵裏桃花仙，桃花仙人種桃樹，又折花枝當酒錢。酒醒祗在花前坐，酒醉還須花下眠。花前花後日復日，酒醉酒醒年復年。不願鞠躬車馬前，但願老死花酒間。車　馬匹勞者趣，酒盞花枝貧者綠。若持富貴比貧賤，一在平地一在天；若持貧賤比車馬，他得馳驅我得閒。世人笑我忒風顛，我笑世人看不穿，記得王陵豪傑墓無洒無花鋤作田。」末書弘治乙丑三月六如居十題。</p>
<p>乾隆年間，庵廢為權貴林苑，沈季友遊此地，發現唐伯虎墳（現在庵東北數十步，地名呌唐寅墳，但找不到埋骨的遺址在那裏了），向宋收仲說及，由宋捐款修墳。沈季友題七絕四首，石刻還在。</p>
<p>（一）「荒徑苔碑二百年，偶然清話及荒阡。中丞自是風流主，憐取桃花小刦仙。」</p>
<p>（二）「重來已結數椽雲，細水陂塘燕尾分。一塢紅香埋骨好，春遊多上解元墳。」</p>
<p>（三）「玩世羞為齷齪官，六如遺墨比珠玕。他家豈少高麟冡？香殺才人玉一丸。」</p>
<p>（四）「在應識我亦飄零，仙草傷心似有靈！買盡吳姬猩色酒，澆君不到九原靑。」</p>
<p>四百年歷刦的故居。有賢宰以身殉職，有名士卑視富貴，有學者不肯屈伏於異族而一瞑不視。這都是我國文化最可寳貴的遺產。他們的故跡，有唐居士的手書，有楊忠節的畫像。如今都零落在漸就傾圯的舊廟裏，成為軍隊養馬的處所。我呢，九年奔走，初得定居。祗要不天天躲警報，不要負着孩子　援五千公尺的高山，也就一切心滿意足，懶得間明年又在何處了。很少有暇時想像唐解元的風流，所以我不能為這個地方題好句。當代也或者還有宋牧仲一類的好事「風流主」，祗是我無從遇見，不能請他們來為幾百年前的先賢消釋小刦。夜深未寢，聽捶錫箔的婦人不肯休憇的震撼聲，頗有一點懷念。我不敢像六如居士那樣輕視富貴，但也不敢忘掉楊忠節公那種不肯茍求富貴的精神。我羨慕昔人那種好的時代，却仍舊堅決地在我道個時代生活下去。</p>
<p>屋後隙地，有小小的桃花一樹，應該是歷千百刦後的遺種了。快到穠春，又含苞將放。到那時候我想採一枝放到我的案頭，伴以幾絲細柳，再重讀白石道人的句子。</p>
<h3>燕柳詞話</h3>
<p>— 阿龍</p>
<p>韋莊，字端己，杜陵人，嘗奉昭宗命使蜀，蜀主王建奪其愛姬，莊感慨萬千因賦荷葉杯一首。「記得那年花下，深夜，初　謝娘時，水堂西面畫簾　，携手暗相期。惆悵曉鶯殘月，相別，從此隔音　。如今俱是異鄉人，相見更無因。」後此詞為姬見，不食卒。</p>
<h3>「山居小品」小引</h3>
<p>— 王進珊</p>
<p>自二十七年夏間入蜀，到今年（三十四年）年底，都常住在山間。「蜀江水碧蜀山靑」，看行雲，聽流水，忽忽已經六七年了。這些年來，不甘寂寞，零零碎碎，也做過一些夢，興之所至，東塗西抹，也寫過一些東西。</p>
<p>據說自古以來，文章即有言志與載道之分，還有什麼「大言炎炎，小言詹詹」之說，再想想我所寫的，載道固有所不足，言志亦未必盡然；大言小言也都高攀不上。雖然說的都是自己要說的，寫的也都是自己願寫的；不但沒有衡量到功過，也很少計算到稿酬；有的被朋友們拿去發表了，有的一直關在抽屜裏。現在一起檢出來，選輯了二十篇，再看一遍，只覺得所寫的雖說不上獨抒性靈，倒也還執着生活，雖談不到不拘格套，倒也還記錄着大時代中一個渺小的生命的感覺。所以我說我的文字也正如作文課題的尾巴，不過「略抒所感」而已。</p>
<p>因常居住山野之間，山村之中，開門見山，閉門還在山裏，遂名之日「山居小品」。雖明知小品二字早已沒落，幸而這裏只為一些已經消逝，和即將消逝的夢影，留一點痕跡；並沒有以幽默自居，更未以性靈自詡；而且大部份黏着現實，有關抗戰，總還不致於像四庫書目提要中說的「不脫明朝小品惡習」吧。</p>
<p>三十四年十二月四日記於四川巴縣小溫泉</p>
<h3>窗</h3>
<p>— 臧贊</p>
<p>有一隻　，我記得開頭是這樣的：「快將開你藍色的眼睛，已經天明；你聽小鳥在林間　唱，愛的　歌：你看破曉美麗的曙光，玫瑰色的天空……」</p>
<p>世界本是美好，不使是攻瑰與愛，可是不睜開眼睛的人確是太多；不僅是睡覺的人。不僅是閉着眼睛，不僅是閉着耳朶和嘴吧，速心也被深深地封鎖着的，不知又有多少。</p>
<p>有的被人封鎖，有的自己封鎖。</p>
<p>十個沉寂的人，九個滿懷不甘於沉寂的憤概與炸藥，他們想哭，想笑，想撕裂一切死寂，但經騐的牆壁這在他的面前——只有沉默。</p>
<p>沉默猶如無底的大海。</p>
<p>（游行於道大海的人，該會聞到那强烈　人的氣息的，這實是不能呼吸的空氣。）</p>
<p>我想起了山城鄉野的小土屋：厚厚的泥土的牆，低厭的屋面，沒有窗，只有一個門，尤其是悶熱而且潮濕的夏日，一個人住在屋裏，只有同蛇鼠過那發霉的生活。</p>
<p>我又想起一些古城裏的大院宅，屋子雖然造得漂亮，但一樣圍以窒人的高牆，而且在門口還坐上兩隻大石獅。住在這高牆裏的，我不敢說他們是人，他們的生活同蛇和耗子一樣，若是人，那也只是心外圍有着更厚的土牆的人。</p>
<p>人與人之間沒有愛，只有防範；沒有眞誠，只有欺驅。愛與眞誠的交流都為大大小小的牆閘住了，在這世上只有理想中才存在。難怪那些說着：「若有一天世人都過警虞實的生活的話，這世界將多麽快的一剎間變成天國」的人，要被人稱作幻想家，被稱作遠離現實的人了。</p>
<p>然而世上確有這類相信天堂的人，而且相信它已存在於世間。他們不但自己相信，也號召別人相信：</p>
<p>「我深信有一個理想繚繞在大地之上，無所不在，一個天堂的理想，它不是僅僅從幻想中產生的，却從一切在其中安居，在其中活動的最終的現實中產生，我相信這個天堂的幻覺己經在太陽光衷，在綠色的大地上，在人類容貌的美麗上，在人類愛心的富裕中……」</p>
<p>一個天堂，不是一個人可以建立的。沉寂而且相信天堂的朋友啊！再打開你的窗，在你堅厚的土牆間　開一個窗，窗外是陽光，是綠色廣寬的大地，窗外有人類美麗的容貌，有人類富裕的愛的揚溢……</p>
<p>鑿開你的牆，一個窗，兩個窗，看得更廣闊。</p>
<p>推開那牆，你從牆裏走出來。</p>
<h3>沙袋</h3>
<p>— 王銳</p>
<p>時接到德義兄電　，知道二十七年在重慶瞧過我腿傷的骨外科專家，陳恒義醫師，在上海某藥房懸壺，我把這消息告了慈。她知道我的腿可以走路以後幾年，還可以動手術，於是一個人不聲不響去見陳醫師。據她回來說，陳醫師己經訊不起我的名字，我當時的傷勢也沒有留下印象，只很誠懇地關照慈，最好請我親自上他那兒去診察一下。</p>
<p>一天寒冷的下午，我跟慈的好分路上某藥房。七年不見的陳醫師還是像七年前那樣紅潤的面龐，飽滿的精神，慈祥的笑容：在在令人覺得和和可親。他問我從戰綫撤退負傷的詳細經過，說髁骨做假關節待骨質較堅時，很有可能；膝節現在可行手術彎曲，但是情形未必能較現狀好。比較妥善的辦法：把腿伸直，使膝節懸擱牀緣，備一沙袋置脚背，使小腿受壓下垂。行此項療法，傷者應平臥床上閱讀書報，這樣膝節在不知不覺中會漸漸彎曲。</p>
<p>現在找醫生也是要講金條約時代，陳醫師雖然有學者風，但慈還是準備了一點錢充治療腿傷的不時之需。如今經陳醫師指示，一個沙袋，豈非輕而易舉，慈當然喜出望外！下了某藥房電梯，在凜冽的寒風中，我提議即刻到外灘一家正在營造宿舍的銀行，去取沙泥，以路上買一份晚報，權充包沙的在用。</p>
<p>求學時期在運動塲上，曾與沙泥發生關係，當我們玩得汗流夾背之時，它還悄皮地躲在脚指縫裏，跟着我們上寢室，登課堂。但眞自沙泥獲得親切感，大概還是從今日始。凝神靜觀，貝壳碎石，斑駁雜陳，曝在太陽下，濕漉漉中閃射出灼灼的金光。可憾者就是水分多了一點，不一會把報紙滲透，即有破裂危險。於是我們不得不上住在銀行附近的衡家，去借沙袋。</p>
<p>慈把黑絲絨熱水包遞給我，自己捧了沉重的沙包，登八十一級的高樓，到衡家時，氣喘喘笑着呌哥嫂們猜，帶來的是什麼東西？他們正在做棗糕，預備度歲了。白濛濛的沾潤着蒸氣的玻璃窗外，可見桐樹的枯枝在冷風中震顫，並且隱的傳來遠處年鑼鼓的聲響。孩子們滿以為我們去送年禮的；知道是一包沙，彎曲膝節用的沙，才把剛時那個疑陣，在每一個人的微笑中融化了。</p>
<p>吃完熟噴噴的棗糕，借到布袋，辭別哥嫂下樓時，我仍然拿黑絲絨熱水袋，慈把沙袋抱在懷中，像小母親抱着初生的嬰兒，邊走邊跳，笑嘻嘻以溫柔婉約的聲調對我說：「這裏面懷着一個希望。」</p>
<p>我她一下，說：「這裏面懷着一個小寳寳！」</p>
<p>我的意思膝節藉沙袋能够彎曲固然好；我們不久以後，要是有了個滿面閃着金光的嬰兒，那這個小寳寳無論在精神上在身體上，一定會比當代的　士　　　康更快樂的。</p>
<h3>談詩</h3>
<p>— 人杰</p>
<p>詩的發展，原是人類整個社會的發展；詩的變動，該跟着時代巨輪的旋轉是一個方向的。那末，就讓詩人一味膜拜二個信仰之神，那是「自由」和「求眞」，由勞働耕耘的結果，使詩成為現實土壞裏所長成的最茁壯樸質的花朵，並將奠下我　　光　。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血204</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這時只聽見鶴見說了一聲「很好」立刻沒有聲音了。不到半秒鐘，又有鶴見要電話號碼的聲音。所要的號碼，正是我們這裏的電話。這才知道鶴見要打電話，徵求W君「突擊」的意見。一聽見鶴見所報號碼，W君立即把傳聲機閉了，伸手拊在電話上，只等着那電話的鈴響。</p>
<p>鶴見為什麼要打電話，我們已經知道，他要說些什麼，我們也猜得着；所以我們現在只注意W君的答案，到底還是堅執旣定計劃，去實行突擊，還是聽從鶴見和萍子的意見，「留下有用的血…　備　　反攻…」</p>
<p>「很對…」W君接着　見的電話，如此答覆着；「突擊問題，早已決定取消了，很感激老兄和貴友萍子小姐的忠告…是…，客氣，客氣，…是，…好，回頭再談…。」</p>
<p>W君放下電話筒，對我們笑了一笑，　　我們現在一而收聽鶴見的談話，一面又收到鶴見的電話，情形有些滑稽。只有W君忽地又收斂了笑容，略一沉吟，好像要解決一個難題似的。這樣想了一會，好像已經得到答案，於是把那抽屜裏的傳聲器又開放了。我想他必是因為鶴見已經把我們這邊情形告訴了萍子，所以還想聽聽萍子對於這個機關，還有什麽意見。傳聲器一開，耀羣把坐椅趕緊移近我的身邊一些，表示要我繼續担任翻譯的工作：</p>
<p>萍，……住在六國飯店的。可是今晚縱然沒有剛才那件事，也非找到您大哥不可。</p>
<p>鶴—為什麽？</p>
<p>萍—時間緊急關係。</p>
<p>鶴—什麼時間，這樣緊急？</p>
<p>萍—我們得馬上動身了！</p>
<p>鶴—「我們？…」什麽事？到那去？</p>
<p>萍—到上海！…唉，大哥，您把我可囑的話，大概都忘了吧！</p>
<p>—叮囑？我不記得你叮囑過什麽</p>
<p>萍子沒有接下去。我們却聽得很緊張，知這萍子可囑的話，必是那個「八」的秘密。却是鶴見作怪；也許他怕萍子把這個秘密的內容故意掯住，藉此指揮鶴見，所以鶴見也故意冷冷地，裝作不記得萍子的話，更沒有把她的「叮嚀」當作一回事。這是一個反激法，並非普通故意刁蛋的行為。萍子沒有開口，想是聽了鶴見的冷話，生了氣了。果然，又是鶴見開口了：</p>
<p>「好了好了，萍子小姐，道也不是傷心的事！…算我對不起吧，因為到了這裏，碰見許多新舊朋友，應酬來不及，也想休息兩天，却不曉得又發生許多問題…」</p>
<p>萍—我知道大哥的朋友多得很呢，至少還有一位很尊敬的「小姐朋友」，哪裏記得我的話？（她的聲音很低，大概一面還在流淚，嗓音沒有那麼甜脆了。說到「小姐朋友」的話，我沒有留心，竟一字不遺，翻譯出來。心下很悔，認為不該把這　告訴耀羣；怕她聽了生氣。但細一看　　的神色，除了嗤的一笑外，毫無變動。東北小姐的天眞坦率，眞呌人佩服。）</p>

<h3>黃金的威脅</h3>
<p>— 李遊</p>
<p>讀格利佛遊記，在大人國與小人國以後，尚有兩個異想天開的所在。其中之一的居民，是一種馬身人面的怪物。這種怪物最愛地上一種特殊的頑石，他們將頑石當作寳物。得到頑石的「人」，藏之唯恐不及，沒有的「人」則想盡種種方法去倫竊與强盜。這個國家的不少糾紛，都是由此而起。</p>
<p>近來看看社會新聞，就常常想到上面這個故事，不禁佩服斯衛甫特　刺的本領。</p>
<p>就拿這幾日的新聞來說吧，比較鬧得最大而且最久的，是復興島的藏金案，其次是天門墜機夾帶金條約傳說，（偵查結果是難以置信，）到最近一兩日，又有漢奸嫌疑犯周更生病死獄中留下家書說取保要三十根金條約奇事。這些案子一時往往很難水落石出，於是讀報的人就常常在報上溫習着它們，使某些人感到無窮的興趣，某些人則感到嚴重的威脅</p>
<p>「人爲財死，烏為食亡，」照理一個不貪財如命的人，應該可以在這一點上心安理得一些了。其實却是並不然的。當黃金尚未禁止買賣以前，某日因為等候電車，我站在一家小銀樓的門口，時已旁晚，暮色如烟，路上行人來來法去，越顯得擁擠和怱忙。銀樓的店堂裏掛有一塊粉牌，上面寫着赤金的行情。這些行人儘管熙熙攘攘，可是走到銀樓門口，駐足向那粉牌望一望，有的唸唸有詞，有的默然而去，還有其他的形形色色，總之一言難盡，可是有一點是斷然無疑的：粉牌上的數字與他們息息相關，他們這樣來也忽忽，去也怱怱，沒有一個不受這數字的擺布，任何一個那怕是火星上來的人吧，看了這種　也要惶惶然起來的</p>
<p>然禁止了，黃金的威脅却仍舊暗地裏存在着。有一位沒有黃金也不想黃金的好好先生，他住在某處亭子間裏已有十年之久，最近大房東收了別人的金條，呌所有住戶連那位好好先生一起出屋。道位先生素以不理會黃金自豪，現在他也感到黃金的鞭子了。</p>
<h3>夫婦應有異性朋友</h3>
<p>— 劉夢</p>
<p>讀了十七日自由談芳先生的「戀愛離婚與夫婦」，對芳先生的高見，難免有些異議。芳先生的話不無相當見地，然而默察事實，我的結論是「不能一概而論」六個字。</p>
<p>人總是感情的動物，交友，除了若干別有用意者之外，就是一種感情的表現。所謂友，當然是不分性別的。純潔的交友觀念應該不含性的關係的，這確是老生常談，但却有至理在，而且也是交友的準則。</p>
<p>不知我是男性的關係呢，還是為了別的什麼，我喜歡交女友，但我和新婚的太太間，却從沒有什麽隔膜，也沒有引起過什麽糾紛；原因是我的太太很信任我，相信我不會有越軌的舉動，而我也誠如她所相信的一樣，僅止於友誼的地步：我和女友通信，會談，雖然無所不言，且不時有熱烈的辯論，可是對方知道我是有婦之夫，我也常記着自己已是個「使君」，互相尊重人格，友植反而更深。</p>
<p>為了工作的關係，我和我的太太間隔了一百幾十里的距離，每當工作到深夜，疲倦到極點而工作還沒告一段落時，太太的信，女友的信都能使我的精神振奮起來，使我繼續工作下去。</p>
<p>結婚後能否結交異性朋友呢</p>
<p>我的意見和芳先生的顯然不同，因為就我個人的經騐，（這二字用得妥當與吾，我不管）。婚後交異性朋友非惟無妨於夫婦間的情感，反能使自己和自己的太太（或丈夫）感到夫婦感情以外友情的可貴和溫暖，因而不感到自己生活的單調。</p>
<p>然而人是感情的動物，又是善妒的動物，（不論男或女）因此婚後交異性朋友，得注意下列各點：</p>
<p>（一）夫婦間必先能互信，互諒，相互間並得留一一個「易地而處」的退步。</p>
<p>（二）與異性朋友間必須坦白，自尊尊人，決不能稍存欺騙的心</p>
<p>（三）切莫濫交：濫交會使你的人格掃地。</p>
<p>這三點也是我交女友的座右銘。</p>
<p>（編者按：這問題，我們收到大批作者的稿件，大多都是反對芳君的意見的，現在選其中一篇發刊於此）。</p>

<h3>記會文正之愛才</h3>
<p>— 愛菊</p>
<p>文正幕中，最為人才淵藪，而公心中，時時以交臂失之為恨。蓋入幕者未必人人能盡其長也。在安慶時，與先君同居一大廳事，中三間，一設長案，黎明即起，幕僚咸集，團坐長案，議當日應辦之事，若今日之開會議然。另二間，一為接見僚廊之所，一則餐廳也。公居西偏一問，東一間，先君居之，專主摺奏，及一切機要文件，公午館後，必小憇，起則圍棋一局，棋劣而速，下十如飛，對局者雖刻意讓步，亦敗時居多。偶勝則掀然大笑。每舉東坡所云：「勝固欣然，敗亦可喜」以解嘲。棋罷必談文藝，經史百家雜鈔，及三十家詩鈔，十八家詩鈔，皆於是時定本焉。</p>
<p>一日蒙賜黃馬褂，初得旨，甚欣然，旣而愀然曰：「吾農家子也，祖若父以躬耕起家，每雨中適市，所御惟釘鞋，今日以黃馬褂釘鞋，分咏作詩鐘，以紀恩，且不敢忘本焉。坐中方各伸紙構思，文正亦當握管未下，而金眉生方伯，已首先交卷矣。其詞曰：「天子非常賜顏色，男兒何事辱泥塗。」蓋集成語也。上聯固天然巧合，下聯則大發牢騷，表面亦仍確切不移公閱之，擊節稱賞曰：「得此一聯，吾輩可以擱筆矣。」是日，適上海道缺出，决晨即委署，且奏補焉。赴任時，特戒之曰：「吾與子平時談論，深知擅長經濟，久思借重長才，惟微嫌意氣浮動，昨一聯文詞致佳，而不平之氣，仍不免太露，非載福之道也。足下此去，切宜歛才任事為要。」後二年，金以奉署江蘇藩司，不終於位。文正可謂有先知之明矣。然公雖愛才，亦有千慮一失之時，先君當談公一　事日：幕中一才士，常同論各省大府，曰某也威，人不取欺，某也察，人不能欺，惟公以德感人，人自不忍欺也。當時公甚韙其論，豈知後委以釐金大局，竟虧負數十萬金，公乃撫膺大呼曰：不忍欺，不忍欺，可見知人之難，而君子可欺以其方也。</p>

<h3>植物奇談</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>假使你在一業熱帶的森林裏旅行，你會發現這座森林好像一家百貨公司，無奇不有。當你走得口渴了，有種棕樹在它的葉柄處生成一個隱秘的水槽，割開葉端就會有一品脫的淸水供給你解渴。「李娜絲籐」割開後也會流出漂白的水的；另一種呌「母樹牛」，割開軀幹能流出甜而美味的液汁，活像你在家飲的牛奶。</p>
<p>「百年草」是當地土人用綫的來源，錢上還帶着針，在每張厚的葉子尖端生着一根針芒。把這張葉子搗爛後，你會發現這針是和許多細而堅韌的筋絲連在一起，中美的紅印度人就用這筋絲紡織出很堅牢的布匹。西班牙人所呌的「毛邊樹」更奇特，把它的樹枝的心髓展開就是一張結構美麗的白色花邊，西班牙女人，就愛從土人聽來這種花邊作圍巾或者嵌在衣服上。</p>
<p>當你要過河了，有種紫心樹的樹皮會作成一個船，它的形狀就像牛皮筏子一樣，漿呢？更方便有種呌「搖漿樹」，它的樹枝扁平直硬，砍下來就是一支自然漿。</p>
<p>雖然你是在荒林中，梳妝還得每天要舉行的。有種攀藤上生看兩片銳利小葉子，可利用來光面修鬚。「肥皂籐」自然利用上了。「格魯格魯棕」的莖，去掉小葉就會是一件新的木梭了。</p>
<p>玩具方面，「鳶樹」上會生一橢圓的樹葉，長闊二三尺，它的葉根就連着極長極牢的絲，那不是放風箏的綫嗎？</p>
<p>藥料除了人人都知道的奎甯樹外，還有「烈山藥」，「吐根」，那都是熱帶森林的竇藏，只要你需要，是用之不完的。</p>
<p>北非還有一種呌「强姦樹」，它的脾性更特殊，任何人碰上了它的支幹的「刺激性的部份」，他就會被樹用樹根捲去，活活「姦」死的。「含羞草」見了你的手去誘惑，會羞答答的收捲起它的葉子，「沒娘草」無根的寄生在樹幹上，「食蟲樹」會用毒性的黏液來獵取小蟲，這些都會使你警異到自然的奧妙和神奇。</p>

<h3>拓荒和落荒</h3>
<p>— 玨人</p>
<p>嚷了多年的「到西北去」，不料一經「復原」之後，大家仍然擠回東南來。本來到西北去是為了要拓荒的，結果「荒」未曾「拓」，只落得「落荒」而走，似乎「一了百了」了。（當年到西北和西南去時，他便都是落荒而走的。）</p>
<p>照說，東南人烟稠密，應該沒有荒地了，然而不然，不但鄉下的荒未墾，連城市中的荒也未拓。有誰到南京和抗州等城區一度看過的麼？你將在偏僻之區發現許多的荒地。「村郭蕭條，城對着夕陽道。一　將不由自主地吟起「哀江南」的舊調來。</p>
<p>縱然有人從別國裏運來無數的禾稼果　牛羣乃至於墾殖的機器，可是，或以無所託庇而消亡，或以無從得資助而耗歇，天然大好，人事不臧，我們天天嚷着窮，却無法呌生產事業蓬蓬勃勃地興感起來。</p>
<p>人們只是擠在市塲上「紙迷金醉」，忘了「土中生白王，地內出黃金的」道地土話。學農的年靑人向我說：「大地是可愛的，泥土的氣息是香的，尤其在這樣的春天裏。可是你一籌莫展，你不能不望着遼閱的荒地流眼淚。」</p>
<p>這話是足以刺痛望治的人的心的。但我記得一則很好的故事。古代寓言裏競有一個老人最後吩咐他的兒子的話是：「我的兒子，你們在這葡萄園裏掘罷。」他們依着老人的話，把園子都掘遍了；他們雖不曾尋着窖藏的金，却把園地鋤遍了，所以那年的葡萄大熟，他們也發了財了。</p>
<p>只顧去鋤吧，墾吧，你不要再夢想在錦江的望江樓前，發掘到張獻忠窖藏下來的金銀財寳，你只須在自己的園地裏掘遍了每一個角落，等到葡萄成然時，你便將有意外的收穫的一天。</p>
<p>可借我們大衆的拓荒的手太少，我們落荒而走的機會太多了。　三十六年植樹節寫於杭州</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>徐紹明點點頭，覺得這一猜很有理由</p>
<p>「那末要不要讓我再給你們拉擺拉攏？」</p>
<p>「也好，請一决客是可以的！」</p>
<p>「別把老祝那一帮人看得這麼輕！老徐。」小沈畢竟比他們聰明，而為了金愛麗的事，更使他認識了他們那班窮光蛋的牛性。</p>
<p>「不管怎樣，先跟他談談有什麽關係？」徐胖子唯一的目標就是要使已給他利用了一次的諸協理胆子不要小下去，這樣才能永遠跟他同流合污。「上决他們鬧的什麽獻金運動，我一個人捐了四十多萬，就是衝着老祝的面子；現在為了這一些小事，要他帮帮忙，他好意思不答應嗎？」</p>
<p>小沈也漸漸有些明瞭徐紹明的心意了</p>
<p>「其實根本可以不踩，讓他們報上駡去！你瞧這一個多月來那一張報上不在大駡岳彰，可是到現在為止，岳彰還是第七集團軍的總司令！你們中茶公司又不是沒有背景的？」道會兒可顯出小沈的伶牙利齒來了，說得徐胖子和諸老頭兒都鞦喜起來。</p>
<p>徐胖子更是興奮得伸手拉住了小沈那件白毛巾布製的新式夏威夷衫饑拖，要他也坐下去喝酒。</p>
<p>小沈裝腔作勢地坐了下去，徐紹明忙着用筷打碟子，呌阿史拿酒杯來。</p>
<p>「天地良心！其實我諸希農能有幾個錢到手？無非也是帮帮朋友的忙而已！」赤鼻子的諸協理眯着一雙細眼，懷由訴似的向其餘兩個人說。</p>
<p>「當然，你老兄是專講良心的人！」徐胖子笑着說，多少有一些議刺的意味，但不敢露骨，也沒有笑出聲。</p>
<p>小沈心裏也在笑，但臉上沒有透出來</p>
<p>「這幾天老祝那一班傢伙在忙些什麼？他們簡直不想要逃難！」他好奇地問。</p>
<p>徐胖子正在嚼吃一塊鮑魚，沒有來得及回答。</p>
<p>「好像又在那裏忙着演戲勞軍吧？」諸老頭兒不很肯定地說。</p>
<p>「誰說不是！」胖子嘴裏的鮑魚已吞下去了。「他們就是愛幹這類出風頭的事！我那二表嫂倒是跟他們最說得上的，到了桂林，什麽都不急，這幾天差不多天天土藝術館去，說是帮他們畫佈景……」</p>
<p>小沈突然注意起來。</p>
<p>「不就是坐在外面院子裏乘涼的那一位嗎？」他睜大了一雙眸子，興奮得異乎尋常地問。（二）（三）</p>

<h3>The National Government's Proposal to Add a Vice Chairman Submitted for Discussion at Today's Plenary Session; Closing Declaration Largely Drafted</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 23rd] The Third Plenary Session, originally scheduled for seven days, is now set to hold its tenth general meeting in the morning and afternoon of the 24th, followed by a closing ceremony, as several important cases have not yet been fully discussed. At the ninth general meeting on the 23rd, a total of five important proposals were passed. Cases originally planned for discussion, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 4, were postponed to the tenth general meeting on the morning of the 24th due to time constraints. Among these, the more important one is the proposal submitted by the President to add a Vice Chairman to the National Government. It is reported that Chairman Chiang had previously requested the Central Standing Committee through the National Government's Civil Affairs Office to amend the National Government's organization, revising relevant articles. After being submitted to the Standing Committee for discussion, the decision was to "defer discussion." Today, the President resubmitted the proposal to the general meeting for discussion and will personally attend to explain. In addition, the tenth general meeting on the 24th will also present for discussion the "Review Report of the Economic Review Committee" and the "Political Reform Proposal" submitted by the Political Review Committee, requesting a public decision from the general meeting. Furthermore, the draft of the declaration for the plenary session has been largely completed by the Drafting Committee and will be submitted to the general meeting for discussion on the 24th. As for the temporary motion on the attitude towards the Communist Party proposed by Zhang Ji and 59 others on the 23rd, the general meeting has summarized seven key points and forwarded them to the Drafting Committee for reference and inclusion, to clarify the Kuomintang's future attitude towards the Northern Party.</p>
<h3>Punishment of Those Responsible for the Gold Rush Submitted to the Central Standing Committee for Effective Handling; Preparation Plan for Constitutional Implementation Mostly Passed</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing, 23rd] The Third Plenary Session's ninth general meeting was held at 9:30 AM on the 23rd, with 2440 people present. After Chairman Ju Zheng reported on matters from the Secretariat, temporary motions were discussed: (1) Proposed by Huang Yu-ren and 100 other committee members, requesting the punishment of senior officials responsible for the "Gold Rush" and a thorough investigation of the accounts of "Government-Operated Commercial Firms," confiscating the property of corrupt officials to purify the officialdom and appease public anger, a resolution was passed, submitting it to the Central Standing Committee for prompt and effective handling. (2) Proposed by Committee Member Zhang Ji and 59 others, stating that the Communist Party is in full rebellion, destroying unity and endangering people's livelihood, and that the attitude towards the Communist Party issue should be re-decided to maintain unity, protect people's livelihood, and facilitate the implementation of constitutional government, a resolution was passed. (3) Proposed by Committee Member Chen Ce and 48 others, requesting that Qiongya be promptly reorganized into Hainan Province to eliminate banditry, stabilize the Southwest, facilitate the development of resources, and strengthen national defense, a resolution was passed. (4) Proposed by Committee Member Yu Junxian and 31 others, requesting that Hankou City be changed to a municipality directly under the Executive Yuan, a resolution was passed. Subsequently, the discussion on the preparation plan for constitutional implementation continued. Committee members Liang Han-cao, Sun Ke, Cheng Zhong-xing, and Miao Pei-cheng spoke successively. After a ten-minute break at 11:00 AM, Committee members Gu Zheng-gang, Ren Zhuo-xuan, Lin Zhong-xiang, and Zhang Jiu-ru expressed their opinions. A resolution was passed in principle, submitting it to the original review committee for text refinement. Subsequently, the draft resolution on the military report was discussed and passed with amendments. Then, the handling method for the opinions of the Political Review Committee on relevant political proposals was discussed, totaling 26 proposals. Each proposal was either passed with amendments or passed according to the review opinions. Finally, the Secretariat reported that the general meeting would continue at 3:00 PM and adjourned at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] During the ninth general meeting of the Third Plenary Session on the morning of the 23rd, a temporary motion proposed by Huang Yu-ren and 100 others, requesting the punishment of senior officials responsible for the "Gold Rush" and a thorough investigation of the accounts of "Government-Operated Commercial Firms," confiscating the property of corrupt officials to purify the officialdom and appease public anger, was submitted for public decision and has been passed, submitting it to the Central Standing Committee for prompt and effective handling. The full text of the proposal is recorded as follows: It is found that the Gold Rush of December of this year spread from a corner of Shanghai to the entire country, and wherever it spread, prices soared and the people resented it. Tracing the origin of the disaster, it is impossible not to investigate where the responsibility lies. The Economic Supervision Team had already investigated it before, and the four supervisory committee members of the Supervisory Yuan thoroughly investigated it after, and their investigation reports were published in detail in the press as early as the beginning of this month. The Supervisory Yuan has also formally filed an impeachment case against Comrade Song Zi-wen, the former President of the Executive Yuan, and Comrade Bei Zu-yi, the former Governor of the Central Bank. Therefore, the responsible senior officials cannot just resign or be dismissed as a way to end the matter. The original intention of the policy of selling gold was to recover legal tender, but those responsible for presiding over it not only mismanaged it, but also had suspected collusion with merchants to manipulate and seek profits. It is urgent to urge the government again to file a disciplinary action in accordance with the law, and to transfer it to the Central Supervisory Committee to quickly investigate and discuss it, in order to purify party discipline. Furthermore, this newspaper reported that "Government-Operated Commercial Firms" such as Yitong Company, Fuzhong Company, China Construction Bank Company, and Yangtze Construction Company, etc., all used "special privileges" to settle large amounts of foreign exchange to import large quantities of luxury goods, making it difficult for ordinary merchants to compete, and foreign merchants have repeatedly protested because of this. This is not only ridiculing friendly countries, but also contrary to the principle of opposing monopoly in the People's Livelihood. Moreover, these "Government-Operated Commercial Firms" are mostly corporate institutions of bureaucratic capital, and there are many properties of corrupt officials among them, all of which are obtained by plundering people's fat and ointment. Our party is a revolutionary political party, and it should be our mission to create a clean government. It is appropriate to separately send senior officials from the Supervisory Yuan and the Central Supervisory Committee to break through all personal considerations and thoroughly investigate the accounts of these "Government-Operated Commercial Firms." Those who have solid evidence of collusion with corrupt officials should immediately close their companies and confiscate their property to purify the officialdom and appease the people.</p>

<h3>Resolution on Military Report; Briefly Points Out Seven Points of Attention, Hoping That the Competent Authorities Will Plan and Implement Them</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing, 23rd] At the ninth general meeting of the Third Plenary Session on the morning of the 23rd, the "Resolution on the Military Report" was passed. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>After hearing the military report of Chief of General Staff Chen, the meeting is fully aware of the various military measures taken in the past year. Under the leadership of the supreme commander, they have been carefully managed, striving for excellence and achieving great results. For example, the military rehabilitation work such as disarming the Japanese army and sending Japanese prisoners back to their country has been completed according to plan, which is commendable. As for the various plans for reorganizing and building the army, they have been accurately implemented and gradually carried out. Significant gains have been made in reducing the number of troops and enriching the quality, reforming the national defense system and unifying the institutions. In particular, our loyal and patriotic officers and soldiers have sacrificed their lives in bloody battles and endured hardships to support the long-term war of resistance and achieve the final victory. They should have been released from their armor and returned to their hometowns to recuperate. The government understands the difficulties of the times and sympathizes with the people's difficulties, and has repeatedly tolerated the Communist Party and repeatedly negotiated with them. Its sincerity and difficulties should be understood by people at home and abroad. However, the Communist Party unreasonably refuses to close the door to peace and is willing to be the enemy of the people, destroying national unity and disturbing local peace. As a result, the plan for reorganizing the army has not been completed quickly, and the work of building the army has been difficult to advance smoothly. Therefore, the officers and soldiers who resisted aggression for the sake of saving the country have to quell the military rebellion for the sake of saving the people. This is indeed a necessary measure to protect the country and the people, but it has a great impact on the national construction work after the war. It is hoped that local order will be restored as soon as possible so that our compatriots across the country can enjoy the happiness of peace and stability. At a time when the pacification mission has not yet been completed and the work of building the army needs to be promoted urgently, the matters that should be paid attention to in the military are briefly pointed out as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Improve the treatment of officers and soldiers, and pay attention to the welfare of officers and soldiers to ensure the livelihood of themselves and their families.</p>
<p>(2) Boost morale and restore the inherent traditional spirit of our army, so that they can realize that their actions are for the sake of the country's foundation and saving the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>(3) Rectify military discipline so that the military and the people can be as close as fish and water to achieve the effect of cooperation.</p>
<p>(4) Settle unemployed soldiers and effectively handle the reemployment of officers so that soldiers will not lose their jobs. In particular, honorable soldiers must be settled to maintain military morale.</p>
<p>(5) Rewards must be credible and punishments must be just. All statistics of troops, reports of military intelligence, and the issuance of supplies must be accurate. If there is any false report or concealment, they should be severely punished.</p>
<p>(6) Effectively implement the conscription law and improve the lives of new recruits. Request that the training of new recruits be prolonged to avoid relying on foreign assistance.</p>
<p>The above points are urgent matters to be carried out in the military at present. It is hoped that the competent authorities will further study, plan and implement them. As for the party, government, military, and people in the pacification area, they must work together as one to make the people the outer periphery of military affairs, military affairs the vanguard of politics, politics the expression of party affairs, and the Three Principles of the People the leading center of the people. It is hoped that all relevant departments will pay close attention to this.</p>

<h3>The Plenary Session Passed a Resolution on Foreign Affairs; Reaffirming Our Firm Position; Maintaining World Peace and Welcoming Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing, 23rd] At the general meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd, the Third Plenary Session passed the Foreign Affairs Review Committee's resolution on foreign affairs. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>It has been a year since the Second Plenary Session. During this year, the important measures in foreign affairs have generally been in line with the decisions of the Second Plenary Session. Our country's position in repeatedly participating in international conferences is considered appropriate. In consultation with the allied nations, we have sent approximately 3 million Japanese prisoners and Japanese expatriates in one year, eliminating a major remnant for peace in our country and East Asia. The plenary session expresses its deep appreciation for the assistance and efforts of the United States. Recently, our country has repeatedly declared its solemn position, opposing and refusing to participate in any international conference to discuss issues involving China's internal affairs, which is especially the unanimous proposition of the plenary session. At this time when the international situation is complex, China should uphold its original intention of cherishing world peace and strive for cooperation with allied nations. However, China's independent and autonomous position and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty will continue to be vigorously defended and must not be harmed in the slightest. The plenary session believes that the party's established foreign policy is extremely correct. For the sake of clarity and specificity, the following eight points are listed for compliance: (1) Reaffirm China's determination to maintain and cherish world peace. China's post-war construction depends on international peace and cooperation. China should consistently strive for mutual trust and mutual assistance among friendly nations. (2) The ties between the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council should be effectively strengthened. (3) China should strictly implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with a friendly attitude and a firm position, so that the treaty truly becomes the foundation for peaceful cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. (4) The principles of "sovereign equality of member states" and "non-interference in internal affairs" stipulated in the United Nations Charter are the cornerstone of world peace and must be implemented. (5) The integrity of territorial sovereignty is the lifeline of national survival. The party will continue the efforts of the national revolution for more than 50 years and defend it. (6) The party expresses its warm sympathy and respect for the movements for national independence and freedom around the world, but it must do its best to protect the lives and property interests of overseas Chinese everywhere. (7) No retaliatory policy will be taken against Japan, but the resurgence of its military aggression will be prevented in cooperation with the allied nations and its political democratization will be promoted. As for the heavy losses of life and property suffered by China in the Japanese war of aggression, the legitimate demands for justice and fairness will be entrusted to it for practical compensation. (8) International capital and technology cooperation are welcome under the principle of equality and mutual benefit.</p>
<p>In the future, when implementing foreign policy, special attention must be paid to the flexibility of its application and the firmness of its attitude in order to implement the advocacy of guaranteeing national rights. In order to achieve the task of protecting overseas Chinese, treaty negotiations should be stepped up on the one hand, and capable personnel should be carefully selected to enrich the embassies and consulates in various places on the other hand. Other areas that need to be improved should be closely monitored by the competent authorities at any time.</p>
<p>In short, China fought side by side with the Allied nations, sparing no unprecedented sacrifices, to exchange for common victory. China must do its best to maintain this hard-won international status. It is the consistent and firm proposition of the party and compatriots across the country that an independent, autonomous, strong China is an indispensable condition for ensuring world peace. The party has led the heroic eight-year war of resistance against aggression and militarism, and will continue to work closely with the Allied nations with the same spirit and effort to jointly lay the foundation for world peace under the banner of international justice.</p>

<h3>Communist Troops in Northern Shaanxi Scramble in Disarray, Still Trying to Muster Remnants to Counterattack Yan'an. Important Agencies Relocate Without Fixed Addresses.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 23rd] After the national army captured Yan'an, the old nest of the Chinese Communists, the communist troops suffered heavy losses and were in extreme disarray. According to sources concerned: A remnant of the communist army has now fled to Suide, and its leadership has issued an emergency order to mobilize seventeen brigades from Hebei, Shandong, and northwestern Shanxi, attempting to counterattack Yan'an.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The CCP Politburo has moved to Nan Ershilipu in Qingjian, the Border Region Government has moved to Wayao Fort, and the Communist Party's Yan'an Broadcasting Station has been renamed the Shaanxi North Xinhua News Agency Broadcasting Station and has also moved to the area. Other important agencies have moved to Wayao Fort and Hao Gou to the east, while family members in Yangjiayuanzi have all moved to northwestern Shanxi and Suide. However, with the national army advancing north in recent days, there are signs of further relocation.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 23rd] On the highway from Suide to Wubao, remnants of the Communists have been moving eastward along with livestock and vehicles in recent days, intending to cross the river and flee to western Shanxi. Furthermore, the CCP broadcasting station in Anding Wayao Fort, in view of the approaching front lines, was only set up for three days before being moved again to Xujiaping, northeast of Suide. Also, a brigade, a second brigade, and the New Eighth Brigade of the communist army are still gathered on the north bank of the upper and middle reaches of the Hulu River in northwestern Zhidan County, awaiting suppression.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] The national army advancing towards Yanchang in northern Shaanxi briefly broke into Yanchang City at noon on the 22nd. After fierce street fighting, they withdrew and continued to engage in fierce fighting in the southern suburbs. Furthermore, the national army in the Yulin area has made new deployments, and part of it has advanced to the Huanghe (Yellow River) ferry crossing in Fugu in the northwest, moving south along the river to cut off the communist army's retreat into Shanxi.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] According to a dispatch from Taiyuan: The CCP headquarters has crossed the Yellow River and infiltrated Xing County and Kelan County in its Shanxi-Suiyuan Military Region. The Shanxi-Suiyuan National Army and the Shanxi-Shaanxi-Suiyuan Border Region Commander Deng Xihou's troops are on high alert. A major battle in northwestern Shanxi is unavoidable. Furthermore, the communist army in southern Shanxi is becoming active, with more than 10,000 people gathering near Yicheng, forming an encirclement. More than 3,000 people have also fled from the Zhongtiao Mountains to the vicinity of Jiang County. It is reported that the communist army is actively forming an underground military command in Xing County, and its Taiyue Military Region is mobilizing each village to send ten soldiers, with criminals who join the army being exempted from punishment.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 22nd] Rumor has it that Mao Zedong fled to Fangshan in western Shanxi, but this has not been confirmed. After the recovery of Yan'an, the situation in northern Shanxi has become tense. Last year, the joint defense of Datong by the Second and Twelfth War Zones laid the foundation for joint defense, and it is said that the commander is an old subordinate of the commander, so there are many conveniences in the joint defense. On the eve of the national army's recovery of Yan'an, the joint defense measures in the Datong area by the two war zones had been strengthened.</p>
<p>Yan Xishan told reporters that the communist army's intrusion into Shanxi would be met with a severe blow.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd] After the recovery of Yan'an, the communist army will flee east to Shanxi, but the military authorities here are very confident in giving them a head-on blow. This was what Governor Yan Xishan said in response to reporters' inquiries. Yan believes that the recovery of Yan'an has broken their nerve center, but the communist army has been plotting for Shanxi for a long time. This time, losing Yan'an will naturally increase the pressure on Shanxi and take an offensive. He believes that even if the communist army invades, its strength will not exceed the strength of the Yijiao campaign at the end of January. In that campaign, the communist army had a total of seventeen brigades, eight regiments, and nine detachments, totaling 200,000 people, and they were still defeated. This time, it will be even more difficult to succeed. When reporters asked about the comparison of the communist army's strength in Shanxi with that of the national army, Mr. Yan replied: The communist army adopts a tactical method of facing, concentrating its use, and mobilizing quickly. A border region often includes several provincial areas, and its numbers are difficult to count. Although it is more numerous than the national army in Shanxi, its combat power is low. As for the progress of the pacification work in Shanxi, he said that there are currently four areas that are actively developing. Regarding the reorganization of the Commander's Office, Yan said: The Pacification Office has been approved to be established on April 1, and the personnel in the Gu Office are being selected.</p>
<h3>Communist Army's Offensives Repeatedly Frustrated, Calm Returning to Jinan Periphery, National Army in Western Shandong Reaches Suburbs of Dong'a City</h3>

<p>[Another Dispatch] The communist army's renewed offensive, which began on the evening of the 17th, suffered heavy losses due to the strong resistance of the national army, and has become silent since the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 23rd] The national army that recovered Dongping in western Shandong continued to advance north on the 23rd and had reached the suburbs of Dong'a City by the afternoon. The city could fall at any moment. Two brigades of the communist army Liu Bocheng's remnants, numbering 7,000 to 8,000 people, have fled from the northwest of Feicheng to the Anjiazhuang area west of Dakou, attempting to stop the national army from advancing north.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The national army in northwestern Henan launched a large-scale sweep against the communist army in the Shijing area north of Xin'an County from Tiemen on the 19th. The remnant communist army fled north in disarray across the river. Currently, there are no traces of the communist army south of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The national army on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui swept the areas of Bancheng, Qingyang, Jin Suozhen, and Gaoji east of Sixian on the 20th. The remaining communist army of more than 1,000 people was repeatedly defeated and fled north. Currently, there is no communist army disturbing the northwestern area of Hongze Lake.</p>
<h3>Communist Army Mobilization in Hebei Province Attempting to Flee Along Jinpu Railway Line</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 23rd] The communist army entrenched in the Lixian, Boye, Anguo, and Gaoyang areas is urgently gathering in the Hejian and Xianxian areas, appearing to be fleeing east along the Jinpu Railway line.

<h3>Liaoning Communist Army Attacks Tonghua, Fierce Battle Lasts Four Days</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd] The communist army's pseudo-Third and Fourth Columns and Independent Second Division and pseudo-local troops, with a force of more than 30,000 people, have besieged Tonghua for four days.

The defense of the city is maintained by a self-defense force organized by the people themselves.</p>
<h3>Chen Yi Sends Confidants to Assassinate Xu Xiangqian</h3>
<p>Many of Xu's Troops Surrender to the National Army</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 23rd] Xu Xiangqian, a communist army general who once commanded more than 50,000 communist troops entrenched in northern Jiangsu, has been trying to reorganize his remnants and flee to central Shandong to continue his rebellion since he was surrounded and defeated in the Linqu and Linyi campaigns. Chen Yi has always had friction with Xu, and this time he took advantage of his defeat to secretly send his confidants to assassinate him in a certain place. Xu's troops' morale was shaken, and many of them surrendered to the national army with their weapons.</p>
<h3>Shanxi Province Launches Campaign to Prevent Import of Luxury Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 23rd] Recently, consumer luxury goods such as cigarettes and cosmetics have been continuously transported by air and by land from Linfen, hindering the import of essential goods and greatly affecting people's livelihood. Chairman Yan specially enlightened all sectors to overcome this bad phenomenon. Occupational groups, organizations, and the press should respond, call for meetings to discuss, and decide to appeal to the society and send letters to aviation and other relevant parties, requesting to stop transportation. Shanxi Province and Shijiazhuang have decided on measures to exchange goods. Shanxi's soybeans, bean cakes, steel, matches, cement, fur, cigarettes, wool fabrics, cloths, cotton, salt, and cattle and sheep skins are exchanged for goods. Both parties' business firms and agencies must apply to the Shanxi Economic Management Bureau and the Shijiazhuang Materials Management Committee for certificates before they are allowed to transport and sell.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Crux of the Indian Situation</h3>
<p>Lord Mountbatten, the new Governor-General of India, has arrived in Delhi and will soon be sworn into office. The arrival of this new Governor-General coincides with Britain's announcement of its withdrawal from India. His coming to India is undoubtedly to clear up the British Empire's rule in India. Lord Mountbatten, with his identity as a member of the British Royal Family, coupled with his excellence as a military and political talent, having previously been stationed in Ceylon, India, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Southeast Asian Theater, is naturally the most suitable candidate to revisit his old stomping grounds as the Governor-General of India after the war. However, this time Lord Mountbatten's return to India is not in the capacity of a military commander, but as the Governor-General of India, perhaps the last Governor-General of India, coming to Delhi with shared emotions, though not necessarily the same as when he was the commander in charge of the Southeast Asian war effort. The fate that India will encounter hereafter undoubtedly has a share in Lord Mountbatten.</p>
<p>What greets Lord Mountbatten upon his arrival in India as Governor-General? It is India's unrest. In Bengal, the leading province of India, the local Muslim League is planning a "Pakistan Day" to welcome the arrival of the Governor-General; in Travancore in southern India, there are claims for independence; and in Punjab, Peshewar, and other regions, the disturbances have not ceased. Today in India, the animosity between Muslims and Hindus is steadily worsening. Among them, there is mutual fear, suspicion, and resentment. This is a turbulent India, and Britain's announcement of its withdrawal from India and the arrival of the new Governor-General Mountbatten not only do not seem to calm the turmoil, but instead exacerbate it. We worry about India's future and believe that this turbulent situation must be stabilized.</p>
<p>Of course, the reason for this turbulent situation is the incompatibility between Hindus and Muslims. The Hindu-Muslim conflict is not just a religious issue, but a historical problem in India. If it is a "country," then India is a vast and complex country, the complexity of which is beyond our imagination. In the past, British rule in India took advantage of this complexity. Exploiting these contradictions to rule India was a consistent policy of the British Empire. When the Indian National Congress was rampant, the rulers of the British Empire used the Muslim League to resist the Indian National Congress, and arrested their leaders, such as Nehru and Gandhi, and imprisoned them. The slogan "Pakistan," although having its historical background, was to some extent a result of the support of the imperial rulers. The policy of New Delhi, perhaps including London, seemed to use the Muslim League to resist the National Congress, and the National Congress to resist the Muslim League. The proposal of the "Pakistan" slogan was the victory won by the Muslim League at its first meeting. After winning this victory, the imperial rulers then turned to support Nehru and the Congress Party. Therefore, the British rulers should be held responsible for the turmoil in India.</p>
<p>Now that Governor-General Mountbatten has taken office, and Britain has announced its withdrawal from India in June 1948, what is urgently needed now is how to enable Hindu-Muslim cooperation. The deeper the rift between Hindus and Muslims, the less favorable it will be for India's future. The Prime Minister of Australia has already expressed concern for India's future in his parliamentary debates. What we want to say from the perspective of a neighboring country is that before withdrawing from India, Britain must reach an agreement between Hindus and Muslims, so that India can have a future. Since Marshal Wavell was somewhat dismissed for this reason, we hope that Lord Mountbatten can see the crux of the chaotic situation in India and achieve a proper solution.</p>
<p>Public Utility Subsidy Policy</p>
<p>The price increase of public utilities has been formally rejected by the National Price Commission. The losses incurred will be subsidized by the government. This matter is of great significance and should not be regarded merely as the resolution of a pending issue for public utilities.</p>
<p>It is recalled that when the Economic Emergency Measures Plan was passed on February 16, the chairman stated, "If the government continues to subsidize various public utilities, the budget cannot be maintained, so reasonable increases should be made in the future." It can be seen that the price increase proposal was decisively rejected, and the government shouldered the subsidy instead, which has profound significance and great concern.</p>
<p>One of the meanings is of course to seek price stability and to avoid repeating the mistake of leading price increases. From the perspective of suppressing prices, the steps are consistent and the stance is firm, which can be seen by everyone in the world. And correcting the past practice of state-owned enterprises taking the lead in raising prices, and using facts to demonstrate the determination to stabilize prices, is sufficient to be a clear indicator for the implementation of economic emergency measures.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing, we have not yet seen how the amount of the subsidy, the scope, the period, and even the method will be. But the public utilities referred to are certainly not limited to one place, and the amount of the subsidy must be sufficient for each business to maintain at a minimum level. Therefore, the magnitude of the amount and the burden can also be glimpsed. In these times of a thousand holes and hundreds of wounds, and extreme financial difficulties, the government is still willing to shoulder this heavy burden. If it were not for truly suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods, no one would believe that it would actually be realized.</p>
<p>There are many ways to subsidize, not necessarily limited to taking out cash for subsidies. For example, for state-owned transportation businesses, such as railways and postal services, even when they are clearly losing money, they do not increase prices to make up for it, but instead sit and subsidize expenses. This is also a type of subsidy and is no different from taking out cash to subsidize. The scope of the price freeze this time is not limited to state-owned enterprises, and there are many that are local public or privately operated. In that case, without cash or material subsidies, it is impossible to achieve the purpose of the subsidy. The large-scale implementation of this method is very common in foreign countries, but it is still an innovation in our country. An ancient saying goes, "The beginning is simple, but the end is great." This budding flower is also worthy of cherishing.</p>
<p>Regarding the control of prices, there have been many attempts during and after the war, but the results have not been very good. There are naturally many reasons for this, but an overemphasis on control without seeking reasonable adjustments and remedies is a major cause. Merchants have an old saying, "Do a thousand things, do ten thousand things, but don't do anything that loses money." If they are forced to lose money, the result will either be superficial compliance and a mere formality, or private gain and corruption with endless tricks. Those who advocate control often overlook this point, thinking that since other countries have adopted this policy, why can't we imitate it? They do not know that in handling control, other countries do not aim for income except for specific commodities and businesses, and even disburse huge sums from the treasury to subsidize them clearly. Therefore, prices are reduced, and merchants and people are happy to comply. The reason is that they only seek to reduce their profits, not to seek exorbitant profits, but not to swallow them whole, forcing them to close down, lose money, and sit and subsidize expenses.</p>
<p>Therefore, if this public utility subsidy method can be implemented, it will not only be a powerful measure in suppressing prices, but also a major step forward in price control. If this principle can be applied at any time and any place, we believe that all economic emergency measures will be able to spread like wildfire. This is not to say that everything needs to be subsidized, nor is it to say that all industries need to be subsidized. As long as we are guided by this principle of not seeking profits and striving for a reasonable approach, we can win the trust and cooperation of both the upper and lower levels, and eliminate countless barriers and entanglements.</p>

<h3>Truman Suddenly Orders the Purging of Disloyal Elements, Including Communists and Fascists, All Those Employed in Administrative Agencies Must Be Investigated</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 22nd] President Truman today issued an order to purge public servants who are not loyal to their duties and stipulated various new standards for testing loyalty. The order stipulates that anyone applying for a position in an administrative agency must be investigated for loyalty without exception. The current application method does not have this provision. Each agency shall submit the list of its current employees to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for review. The Prosecutor General should regularly submit the latest list of all destructive groups. Anyone who joins such a group as a member can be regarded as disloyal. The blacklist includes all autocratic, fascist, communist, or destructive groups, as well as those who propose or support the deprivation of the people's constitutional rights by force, and those who attempt to change the current form of government by unconstitutional means. At the same time, a summary table will be created for all those who have been investigated since September 1939. The new method can be adopted by various government agencies. However, it is not suitable for the judicial or legislative branches of the government, nor does it include the meaning of changing the existing military security regulations. The government may request additional funds for the Civil Service Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the former will be $15 million and the latter will be $20 million. The President said that the above two agencies must be responsible for purging internal elements.</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 22nd] President Truman today signed and approved the order to terminate the Price Administration Bureau on June 30, but requested Congress to allow other agencies to continue to control rent and sugar. However, the Senate Republican leader's meeting resulted in divergent opinions on whether rent and sugar should continue to be controlled and how, and no agreement was reached.</p>
<h3>After the Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill Is Passed, the United States Will Loan to South Korea, This Plan Will Not Be Announced for the Time Being</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 23rd] The US Congress discussed last week whether to pass President Truman's $400 million aid to Greece and Turkey to resist the threat of communism in recent times. It will take a long time to debate before this proposal is passed into law, but it will eventually be passed and start a new trend in US foreign policy. Some members concerned about the Far East believe that before the end of the debate, the United States should also engage in an economic war against communism in the Far East. On the one hand, the State Department hopes so, and on the other hand, the development of the already started plan has been drafted to aid Korea with 500 million to 600 million US dollars in three years, of which more than 200 million will be used to rebuild Korea's railways, yarn mills, and other industries in the coming year. This plan will not be announced, and officials will deny this statement before Congress approves aid to Greece, but will submit the aid to Korea bill to Congress at a favorable time.</p>
<h3>The Political Situation in South Korea Is About to Change</h3>
<p>Dr. Seo Jae-pil Returns to Korea from the United States</p>
<p>[This Newspaper Beiping, 23rd] According to sources from Korean people here: Marshall will try to negotiate with the Soviet Union in Moscow to establish a unified government in North and South Korea. If the negotiation fails, the United States will temporarily abandon its plan to establish a unified government in Korea and allow the establishment of a government south of the 38th parallel to satisfy the wishes of the people in South Korea. Dr. Seo Jae-pil, a veteran of the Korean revolution, returned to Seoul from the United States on the 15th of this month. He will serve as a bridge between the United States and the Korean people in the name of the Director of the South Korean Civil Administration and the Supreme Advisor of General Hodge. He may even be a strong preparer for the future South Korean government. Xu was the pioneer of Korean nationalism. He participated in the Gapsin Coup. After the failure, he hid in an American warship. After arriving in the New World, he obtained American citizenship and studied medicine, earning a doctorate. In the year of Eulmi, he returned to Korea as an American and served as a Korean advisor stationed in Seoul. Within one or two years, he was blamed by the Korean King and sent back to the United States. At that time, Xu sat on Namsan Mountain in Seoul and cried bitterly that Korea was about to perish. Forty years later, Xu returned to Korea again and served as an advisor to the newly emerging country. The Korean people placed infinite hope on him (Kim Gu and Syngman Rhee are also advisors).</p>

<h3>Austin Hurries Back to Washington to Review the Impact of the New US Policy on the United Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 22nd] US Representative to the United Nations Austin hurriedly returned to Washington today, which shows the close relationship between the US aid to Greece and Turkey to prevent communism in the Near East and the United Nations question. The preamble to the aid to Greece and Turkey bill submitted by Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Connally, a Democrat, also directly involved the United Nations. It is said that the United Nations Security Council recognizes the seriousness of the situation on the Greek border. At the same time, the State Department has been preparing an official letter, waiting for the President's approval, to be delivered by Austin to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, clarifying the US position and the necessity of this action. Austin is said to be very uneasy about the impact of this unilateral US action on UN member states. Vandenberg and Connally urged the public to pay attention to the fact that the UN Food and Agriculture Organization also recognized that Greece must obtain financial and economic assistance, and suggested that Greece should request such assistance from the UN and the US and UK.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington, 23rd] The rumor that President Truman had sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie explaining the US attitude towards Greece and Turkey was once again denied by White House Press Secretary Ross.</p>
<h3>US Aid to Greece and Turkey Will Be Difficult to Achieve by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 22nd] Senate Democratic Leader Barkley said to reporters today that the bill to allocate 400 million US dollars to aid Greece and Turkey is expected to be unable to pass before the UK stops economic aid to the two countries on March 31.

If the United States must aid Greece and Turkey before the end of March, the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation may grant emergency loans. Barkley also announced that he plans to go to Greece, Turkey, and Palestine in early April to inspect the local situation.</p>
<h3>The Arab League Holds a Regular Meeting, Eagerly Hoping to Obtain Active US Aid</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Ankara, 22nd] As the world is paying attention to the Moscow Conference and the US relationship with Turkey and Greece, the regular meeting of the Arab League held in Cairo by senior officials of the seven Arab countries since March 17 has been almost ignored. Arab League Secretary-General Azzam broke the silence today and announced that all Arab countries support the completion of the unification of the Nile River Basin, namely "Egyptian Sudan", and are eagerly awaiting the withdrawal of British troops from the entire Nile River Basin. The Arab League actually represents 35 million Arabs in the Middle East. The League discussed the Palestine issue and unanimously insisted on opposing the entry of Jews, and announced that the League supports Egypt in the British-Egyptian deadlock. As far as reporters know, the Arab countries are paying close attention to the US aid to Turkey and Greece and hope for similar aid. The Young Party of Egypt, nicknamed the Green Shirt Party, is known for its extreme nationalism. The leader of the party telegraphed Truman, saying that Egypt should also be included in the anti-communist defense line, and the telegram also requested US support to submit the British-Egyptian case to the Security Council. Saudi Arabia has been embraced by the United States due to military, industrial, and economic concessions to the United States. Today, the entire Near East and Middle East are hoping for US aid. So far, they have been fully suppressing communism with arrests and attacks. Only the Communist Parties of Syria and Lebanon have obtained legal status. The Lebanese Foreign Minister has specifically pointed out that Middle Eastern countries need assistance from the United States similar to that of Greece and Turkey.</p>

<h3>The United States Will Notify Relevant Countries to Draft and Review the Treaty of Peace with Japan; The United States Will Draft the Blueprint for the Treaty of Peace with Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] State Department officials announced today that the United States will suggest in its notifications to relevant governments that China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Soviet Union, the five major powers, draft the peace treaty with Japan, and that the remaining eleven members of the Far Eastern Commission form a review department. At the same time, the State and War Departments of the United States have nearly completed the blueprint for the Japanese peace treaty. However, the official denied that the start of this blueprint was due to General MacArthur's urging. According to the official's opinion, reaching a satisfactory peace will take at least nine months to a year. Countries demanding reparations from Japan, such as China, the Philippines, and the United States, may be satisfied soon. However, in light of the situation in Korea, that country's demands obviously still need to be reviewed due to U.S. aid to that country. The official also stated that the most intense dispute in the reparations issue may be between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union regarding the losses they suffered. The Soviet Union will demand compensation, claiming that Japan's restraint of Soviet forces in Siberia during the war prevented them from fighting Hitler, resulting in losses. The United Kingdom, supported by the United States, will deny this point.</p>
<h3>The United States Has Released a Portion of Secret Documents Regarding the Greek-Turkish Aid Case</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] Acting Secretary of State Acheson released to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today the secret documents clarifying the background of President Truman's proposal to aid Greece and Turkey. It was found that this historical background did not have the value of being labeled "confidential." It includes numerous lengthy chronologies dating back to the 1911 revision of the Greek constitution and the disintegration of the Ottoman army in Turkish history, when Tallaat and Enver fled into exile. One document briefly described the situation in Greece, providing information on Greece's struggle in the civil war. However, only about half of the entire archive was released today, with the remainder to be published tomorrow. Some observers expect it to be more important.</p>
<p>After President Truman announced the new foreign policy of aiding Greece and Turkey on March 12, key officials from the State Department and the Army and Navy Departments met the next day to discuss it. Seated in the picture (from left to right) are Assistant Secretary of State Acheson, Senate Speaker Vandenberg, and Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Connally; standing are Army Secretary Patterson and Navy Secretary Forrestal.

<h3>Qianlong Emperor's Imperial Bed to be Auctioned in London</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] According to the "Star" newspaper, the assets of the Bupeng family's "Chinese Villa" will be auctioned starting next month. The valuable furniture includes a dragon bed of the Qianlong Emperor, which was worth £4,000 in 1912.</p>
<h3>The Pan-Asian Conference Opened Yesterday in India with Representatives from Thirty-Two Countries</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 23rd] The Pan-Asian Conference opened today in the ancient fort of Old Delhi, presided over by Nehru, leader of the interim government of India. Two hundred and fifty representatives from thirty-two Asian countries attended, and a crowd of 5,000 people watched the ceremony, making it a grand occasion. The conference chairman is Mrs. Naidu, and the session will last for ten days. Discussions will be limited to economic, cultural, and social issues, and will not involve politics. Among the major Far Eastern countries, only Japan did not participate in the conference. Seventeen representatives from the Asian part of the Soviet Union attended as observers, and the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Australia also sent observers.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 23rd Special Dispatch] Zheng Yanqi, head of the Chinese delegation to the Pan-Asian Conference, and two other representatives attended the guiding committee this morning. Nehru delivered a speech at the meeting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 22nd Special Dispatch] The Chinese delegation to the Pan-Asian Conference arrived here tonight. After getting off the plane, the delegation issued a statement saying, "India is China's neighbor and friend. Nehru's visit to Chongqing during China's life-and-death struggle with Japan left a deep impression on the Chinese people. They also cannot forget the warm welcome the Indian people gave to President Chiang and Madame Chiang in 1942. Mahatma Gandhi, the great leader of the Indian people, is a brilliant model of perfection and goodwill for all mankind. We firmly believe that the long-standing friendship and respect between the two countries will continue to grow. To ensure this, our two countries have now exchanged ambassadors. On the eve of the Pan-Asian Conference being held in this historic city, representatives from Asian countries have gathered to discuss issues of common interest. Our hearts are filled with hope, and we wish this conference will bring the dawn of better times for Asia and all Asian people."</p>
<h3>The Dutch-Indonesian Agreement: Indonesia Has Expressed Its Agreement</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Batavia, 23rd] According to a dispatch, the Indonesian Republican Cabinet decided today to accept the Dutch government's invitation to immediately sign the Cheribon Agreement, without delaying it due to the recent Dutch occupation of Mojokerto in eastern Java. However, President Sjahrir has been ordered to continue to urge the Dutch side to resolve the Mojokerto incident after the signing.</p>
<h3>The Debate on the German Political System Concludes for the Time Being; The Foreign Ministers' Conference Adjourns for Two Days; The Special Committee Will Draft a Comprehensive Report on the Proposals</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] The Foreign Ministers' Conference will adjourn for two days starting on Sunday (the 23rd) to allow all parties to prepare concrete proposals. A special committee has been established, with Vyshinsky representing the Soviet Union, General Clay representing the United States, Hubert representing the United Kingdom, and Alphand representing France. The task of the special committee is to consolidate the different proposals and submit a report to the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 25th. The Foreign Ministers' Conference will reconvene at 4 p.m. on the 25th.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Moscow, 22nd] The four major powers' foreign ministers held their twelfth meeting today and decided to adjourn for two days. The first stage of the Foreign Ministers' Conference and the past two days of debate on the future German political system have come to an end.</p>
<p>At today's meeting, Molotov firmly opposed any federalization plan. The plan proposed by Molotov was similar to the "Weimar Constitution" after World War I. The Soviet Union advocates that the future political system of Germany should be the political system before Hitler came to power, just like the Weimar Republic system. Molotov asked the representatives to study the Weimar Constitution and said that it had many advantages.</p>
<h3>The Four Powers Have Different Stances on Germany's Future Political System</h3>
<p>During the two-day adjournment, the foreign ministers of the four powers need to study many proposals. Here is a brief description of the stances of the four countries:</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>Opposes the hasty establishment of an interim government. It advocates that Germany's future political system should be a decentralized federal system, and the weaker the power of the central government, the better.</p>
<p>United Kingdom</p>
<p>Advocates immediately organizing an interim government, and then organizing a federal government with limited power, with important powers belonging to local governments.</p>
<p>United States</p>
<p>Advocates quickly organizing an interim government, and finally allowing the German people to formulate a constitution with popular sovereignty, restricting the power of the government, with the focus on decentralization of power.</p>
<p>Soviet Union</p>
<p>Also demands the immediate organization of an interim government, and then the organization of a democratic republic with a bicameral parliament and government, guaranteeing the constitutional rights of each state. The Soviet plan is similar to the federal government system, but there are differences in restricting the power of the central government and stipulating the rights of each state.</p>
<h3>The United Kingdom Proposes New Suggestions for Unifying the German Economy</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 22nd] Foreign Secretary Bevin put forward new proposals on the unification of the German economy at the Foreign Ministers' Conference today, stating that the recovery of German industry should be carried out gradually, and proper attention should be paid to supplying coal to the liberated countries. The increase in production rate should be related to the need for coal exports. What should be noted here is that the expenses of the occupying countries should not be increased because of this. Judging from this suggestion, the intention seems to be to enable France to obtain more coal, in order to balance the British proposal to increase German steel production to 10 million tons per year. Bevin also stated that Chapter XIV of the Potsdam Agreement, which is the chapter on the unification of the German economy, should be fully implemented, and the occupation expenses of Germany, in the past, present, and future, should be shared equally by the four powers. The occupation expenditure should first be repaid with German production. He further advocated that materials should be freely exchanged between the four zones, import and export plans should be formulated, the financial reform plan should be implemented as soon as possible, the trusts should be dissolved, and the Allied Control Council should revise the factories and equipment for reparations before July 1 of this year.</p>
<h3>The French Cabinet Decides to Continue its Political Affairs; The Members of the Four Major Parties Decide to Remain in Office</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] The Ramadier government has been preserved due to the compromise of the Communist Party and the temporary change of opinion of the Radical Party. The Communist Party has expressed its willingness to retain the five Communist Party members in the cabinet, but decided to abstain from voting when the parliament votes on the Vietnam military expenditure. Ramadier has expressed his acceptance of this position. The Radical Party had previously passed a resolution ordering the five Radical Party members in the cabinet to withdraw to show their dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Communist Party, but suddenly decided to cancel the resolution to withdraw from the cabinet. Political observers do not regard this as a good phenomenon, and they expect that the reaction of the Radical Party will deepen the scars within the government. Because it is currently during the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, and the country is facing financial and economic difficulties, no political party is willing to take the responsibility of causing a government crisis.</p>
<p>Communist Party member Duclos said in the National Assembly today that although the Communist Party opposes the appropriation of funds for fighting the Viet Minh, in order to maintain the unity of the cabinet, it has ordered Communist Party members to continue to hold office. France must maintain the unity of the coalition government at the present time to avoid hindering France's efforts in the Moscow Conference. We deeply know that our Foreign Minister has encountered serious difficulties in the Moscow Conference to make the conference accept France's views, especially on the coal issue.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the remaining two major parties in the French coalition government have also decided to support the continuation of participation in the government.</p>
<h3>A New Governor Arrives; Accidents Occur Again in India</h3>
<p>Wifeier Flies to London</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 23rd] Muslims held a "Partition of India-Pakistan Day" demonstration today, which clashed with Hindu followers. The police were forced to fire to suppress the riot and imposed martial law.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] The outgoing Governor of India, Wavell, left here for London with his wife today. Governor Mountbatten and others greeted him at the airport.</p>
<h3>The Seventh Largest Continent in the World: The Virgin Land of Antarctica; United Press Correspondence; Translated by the Editorial Department of this Newspaper</h3>
<p>Antarctica, this adventure destination of the twentieth century, has attracted more attention than any unexplored place since Livingstone explored Africa and Perry discovered the Arctic.</p>
<p>The seventh largest continent in the world, Antarctica, is the last continent to be discovered and the only continent that has never had a permanent colony. There are more than a dozen countries that formally or informally claim a part of the continent. The only two countries that have formally declared an interest in Antarctica are in the Western Hemisphere, namely Argentina and Chile. The third country, the United States, has stated that it does not recognize the territorial claims of other countries, and it is still considering whether it will make its own territorial claims.</p>
<p>All the claimed territories in Antarctica are wedge-shaped, with their vertices at the South Pole, and in most places, the flags of certain countries have been erected. The distribution of countries in this new world is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Argentina Claims the Falkland Islands</p>
<p>Argentina has declared that it holds sovereignty over the so-called Falkland Islands dependencies, while the United Kingdom also claims to have sovereignty over the area. The area is located between 20 degrees west longitude and 80 degrees west longitude, including the Graham Land Peninsula and most of the Weddell Sea. Argentina has maintained a meteorological station on the South Orkney Islands since 1902. In addition, Argentine naval officer Sobral accompanied Swedish explorer Nordenskjöld on an expedition to Graham Land from 1901 to 1904, and was finally discovered by the Argentine cruiser "Uruguay" in 1904. Argentina claims that the area should belong to Argentina based on this reason. Although Argentina has put forward other reasons, they lack strong evidence.</p>
<p>Rosa, chairman of the newly established Argentine Antarctica Committee, said that Argentina is close to Antarctica, so it has the right to make territorial claims. In an order issued by President Perón on October 9, 1946, he claimed a part of Antarctica based on the reason that the sandbanks of Antarctica border Argentina. Except for Chile, no government has recognized Argentina's claim.</p>
<p>Argentina sent an expedition to Antarctica for the first time in early January of this year, with Chilean observers accompanying them.</p>
<p>Chile Has Always Been Very Happy About Antarctica</p>
<p>The territory claimed by Chile overlaps with the territory claimed by Argentina and the United Kingdom, but there is also a part of the territory that has not been claimed by any country. The area is located between 53 degrees west longitude and 90 degrees west longitude, and also includes most of Graham Land and unexplored land.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued by the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs on December 14, 1946, based on (1) Chilean whaling ships and seal hunting ships often frequent the seas near the area in the past 100 years, (2) the area is close to the Chilean border, and historical, geographical, legal, diplomatic, and administrative reasons, Chile has the right to own the area.</p>
<p>The Chilean expedition departed for Antarctica on January 15 of this year, with three Argentine observers accompanying them. The general public in Chile is now very concerned about the Antarctic issue.</p>
<p>The United States Has a Long History of Risky Activities</p>
<p>In addition, the third country in the Western Hemisphere that cares about Antarctica is the United States. Although American explorers have been active in Antarctica for 107 years, they have not yet formally made any territorial claims.</p>
<p>Although many British navigators had sailed the Southern Ocean and knew of the existence of Antarctica, it was not until 1840 that U.S. Navy Lieutenant Wilkes discovered Antarctica near 135 degrees east longitude.</p>
<p>In the following years, the United States maintained its dominant position as a major whaling country. American ships have repeatedly broken through the large ice floes in the Southern Ocean. Most Americans have participated in foreign Antarctic expeditions, but the real exploration work did not begin until 1920, when Australian Wilkins and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Byrd made several famous flights, including Byrd's flight across Antarctica in 1929.</p>
<p>American Explorer Rear Admiral Byrd</p>
<p>After Byrd discovered Marie Byrd Land, he advocated that the area should belong to the United States, but Congress did not approve it. Later, Ellsworth made the first flight across the Southern Ocean from Graham Land to Little America, but his territorial claim was also shelved.</p>
<p>If the United States claims any land in Antarctica, it will probably be between 90 degrees west longitude and 150 degrees west longitude. No country has claimed this section of land so far.</p>
<p>The ice-free area (40 miles long) recently discovered by the Byrd Expedition in the Australian part near Knox Land at 101 degrees longitude may become increasingly important and may become a base for long-term exploration.</p>
<p>Three Ice-Free Zones are Most Noteworthy</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this is the third ice-free area that has been discovered in Antarctica, apparently formed by the heat of intermittent hot springs. In 1941, German pilots discovered two ice-free areas, one in Princess Martha Coast on the east coast of the Weddell Sea and one in Princess Astrid Coast further east, both on the other side of Antarctica opposite Byrd's discovery. At that time, the Germans only took a few photos, but did not actually explore them, because their purpose there was to plunder the whaling ships of the United Nations. As a result, eleven ships were captured.</p>
<h3>The Scottish Independence Movement Gains Support from Many Celebrities</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 23rd] It is learned that the Scottish National Party held a meeting in Glasgow last night, demanding Scottish autonomy. Many nobles and three Conservative members of Parliament attended the meeting, which was very important. The demand for Scotland to become an independent state, or at least to establish an independent Scottish parliament, is not a recent event. It has been repeatedly proposed by a small number of National Party members, but it has not been noticed by most Scottish people, because they all believed that uniting with the United Kingdom was more beneficial than independence at that time. This is the first time that the movement has been supported by influential people.</p>
<h3>A Large Uranium Mine Discovered in Mexico</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Mexico City, 23rd] It is reported that a uranium mine (atomic bomb material) worth US$175 million has been discovered in the northern Mexican province of Chihuahua (near the US border). Initially, workers in the area became ill one after another. After expert testing, it was determined that it was due to radio wave radiation. An investigation was conducted and a large batch of high-grade uranium ore was discovered. The exact location has not been announced.</p>
<h3>The Paraguayan Government Begs for Peace; The Rebel Commander Expresses His Determination Not to Accept</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Asunción, 23rd] According to people responsible here, the Paraguayan government has asked the rebels for peace today, because President Morinigo fears that the war will expand and that the southern provinces will also rebel. The peace conditions were put forward by the three generals who are loyal to the government, advocating the formation of a three-headed interim government, chaired by President Morinigo, and also including rebel cavalry commander Colonel Raimas, to save the crisis. The rebel side may accept this condition.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 23rd] Paraguayan rebel commander Villalba told a reporter in Concepción today that we will never accept any request, nor will we meet with any representative of President Morinigo. We will advance into the capital, Asunción, to restore the legitimate rights of the people. The purpose of the revolutionary movement is to overthrow the dictatorship established by Morinigo seven years ago, reinstate the commander-in-chief who was dismissed by Morinigo, restore the freedom of the people, and guarantee the activities of all parties. Former Paraguayan interim president Colonel Franco, who has been exiled in Uruguay, has also arrived in Concepción and delivered a speech saying that I am a party leader and do not intend to lead the revolutionary movement.</p>
<h3>The Rebel's Ultimatum Requires the President to Resign</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 23rd] According to people who have fled from Paraguay to here, Paraguayan rebel leader Galeano has issued an ultimatum with eleven points, demanding that President Morinigo resign immediately. They also said that the president has sent two representatives, General Ondino and Colonel Fancetti, to the rebel headquarters to negotiate peace. It is also heard that Galeano told the two representatives that he will limit the president to reply to his conditions before noon today. If he does not reply after the deadline, all negotiations will be cancelled.</p>
<h3>A U.S. Diplomatic Delegation Will Travel to Nepal at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>To Sign a Friendship and Commerce Agreement</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The U.S. State Department announced today that a U.S. special diplomatic delegation will leave Washington for Nepal at the end of this month to sign a U.S.-Nepal Friendship and Commerce Agreement. The head of the delegation is Sadwiddy, President Truman's personal representative.</p>

<h3>The Civil Aviation Industry Calls on the Government to Fulfill Compensation for Wartime Ship Losses; The Compensation Claims Committee Hosted a Reporter Briefing Yesterday; It is Scheduled to Go to the Capital Again This Week to Request Action</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] During the War of Resistance, the losses of private ships in our country were huge, either because they were requisitioned and ports were closed, or because they were damaged during military and public transportation, or because they were captured by the Japanese, or because they were bombed and destroyed by the enemy. After the victory, the civil aviation industry organized a Wartime Loss Compensation Claims Committee for Private Ships, requesting compensation from the government. After much negotiation, the government has approved the compensation principles and amounts at executive meetings, but the implementation measures have been delayed until now for more than a year and three months, and there is still no news. Shipping companies are extremely anxious. Zhong Shandao, the standing committee member and chief executive of the Compensation Claims Committee, is scheduled to go to the capital this week to request action from the government again.</p>
<p>He especially hosted a press conference yesterday to make an appeal. According to the discussion, the losses of private ships during the war are as follows: (1) 63 ships requisitioned and ports closed, totaling 119,906 tons. (2) 33 ships damaged during military and public transportation, totaling 15,981 tons. (3) 67 ships captured by the Japanese, totaling 111,006 tons. (4) 43 ships sunk by enemy bombing, totaling 49,357 tons. The Compensation Claims Committee submitted the above-mentioned loss figures to the government on December 12, 1945, and suggested methods to restore tonnage: (1) Compensate ton for ton. (2) Compensate based on assessed value per ton. (3) Guarantee overseas orders or shipbuilding.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Approved the Principles</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan approved the principles at its executive meeting on February 26, 1946: (1) Ships that were requisitioned for military purposes, used as blocking projects, and damaged by the enemy while performing military and public duties, and that comply with the provisions of the Military Requisition Law, should be compensated. (2) How to convert the tonnage and depreciation of ships, as well as the index of currency value and steel and wood before the war, should be quickly drafted by the Ministry of Transportation and submitted for approval. (3) The government should facilitate shipping companies to order ships from abroad. (4) Shipping companies can directly apply to the Four Joint Offices for loans. The committee immediately calculated according to the two indexes of metal building materials published by the Shanghai Municipal Government in March 1946, with an exchange rate of 1,200 yuan at that time, and the total amount was converted to US$10 million. It also repeatedly consulted with the Ministry of Transportation and submitted it to the Executive Yuan, which was approved at the 758th executive meeting on September 10, 1946, to compensate US$3.6 million, and ordered the Ministry of Transportation to consult with shipping companies to determine the payment methods for the compensation.</p>
<p>Discuss Compensation Methods</p>
<p>The committee formulated the methods on October 30 of that year. The main points are: (1) Restore 120,000 tons of requisitioned lost ships, averaging US$100 per ton, totaling US$12 million. In addition to the government's compensation of US$3.6 million, the remaining amount should be provided by government loans or guarantees to order or renovate from abroad. (2) The amount of the government guarantee or loan will be guaranteed by ships obtained from Japan's reparations in the future. However, this submission was submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry on October 30 of last year, and it has not been approved yet. Therefore, more than 30 shipping companies before the war have not been able to resume business. At a time when governments of all countries attach importance to marine shipping and the civil aviation industry in our country urgently needs to be developed, it is hoped that the government can specifically implement it as soon as possible in the near future, so that the ship compensation case that has been settled and has been worrying the damaged shipping companies day and night can be properly concluded as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Rear Area Factories Rehabilitation Association Invited Guests to Visit Four Factories, Production Greatly Affected by Coal and Electricity Restrictions</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The Rear Area Factories Rehabilitation Association, consisting of various small and medium-sized factories in the rear areas, provided significant services to the military and civilian populations during the war. After the victory, they returned to Shanghai and, after repeated requests, obtained approval from the Executive Yuan to purchase or lease enemy and puppet factories that had failed to sell after two auctions. The first batch of purchasing and leasing procedures was completed in mid-September of the previous year. However, only a dozen or so were able to resume operations. Most had been shut down for more than a year after being taken over and were in a state of disarray and rust. Furthermore, due to restrictions on fuel, electricity, capital, and factory personnel, not all were able to formally resume production. The second batch was held as late as February of this year, but has not yet been approved and implemented. In order to allow all sectors to understand the current situation of each factory, the association invited the Shanghai press yesterday afternoon to visit the factories. More than thirty teachers and students from the Shanghai Jiaocheng Elementary School also accompanied the visit, guided by Xie Tiansheng, the association's general secretary. Due to time constraints, only four factories were visited: the Shanghai Paper Mill, the Shanghai Dahe Industrial Factory, the Yong'an Electromagnetic Factory, and the Shanghai Qiwen Machinery Factory. Among them, the Shanghai Paper Mill has not yet resumed production. According to Xie, all twelve felt strips, twenty-one copper wire cloths, and more than sixty tons of pulp at the factory have been transferred to the state-run Jiangnan Paper Mill. The issues of factory personnel and electricity connection have not been resolved, leading to the factory's failure to resume production to this day. At a time when paper shortages are severe, it is a great pity that the machinery remains rusted and idle. The factory has a complete set of pulping digesters and papermaking machines, all of which are currently exposed to rust and damage in the factory building. After resuming production, it could produce 300 tons of paper per month. The other three factories that have resumed production include the Dahe Industrial Factory, which is the only factory in Shanghai specializing in the production of asbestos tiles. It covers an area of more than forty mu and is very large in scale. It currently produces 600 asbestos tiles per month, each three feet seven inches long and two fen thick. The Yong'an Electromagnetic Factory, along with the Central Electromagnetic Factory, were the only two electromagnetic factories in the Southwest during the war. After the victory, it returned to Shanghai. Due to restrictions on coal and electricity supply, it could not produce on a large scale, so it opened a branch factory in Fuliang, Jiangxi. Its products are sold in the Southeast, but the high transportation costs have resulted in significant deficits. The Shanghai Qiwen Machinery Factory, which specializes in the production of numbering machines, has also been greatly affected in its output by daytime electricity restrictions.</p>

<h3>The New "Haixin" Vessel on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line Opens for Public Viewing</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has added another new vessel, originally named the "Averill," built by the Detroit Company of Canada. It has now been renamed the "Haixin," with a gross tonnage of 2,484 tons, a length of 246 feet, a width of 42 feet 3 inches, a depth of 15 feet 9 inches, a draft of 12 feet, and a speed of 12.5 miles per hour. It has two smokestacks, four boilers, two triple-expansion four-cylinder steam engines, 2,400 horsepower, two steam generators, and cold storage and air conditioning facilities. The passenger accommodations include three special-class cabins, equipped with heating, sofas, and private bathrooms and toilets.</p>
<p>The first-class A-deck has a total of twenty-three cabins, accommodating forty-eight passengers. The economy first-class AB decks have a total of eighty-five cabins, accommodating three hundred and ten passengers. The third class has berths, accommodating more than four hundred passengers. The fourth class has high berths, accommodating more than six hundred passengers. Yesterday afternoon, the vessel was berthed at Pier 13 on the Bund, and guests from all walks of life were invited to visit. Four or five hundred people boarded the ship, praising it without end. The passenger accommodations are comfortable, the facilities are perfect, and with the fresh paint, it looks even more magnificent, worthy of being called the best passenger ship in China today. It is reported that it is scheduled to set sail on the 26th of this month, joining the Shanghai-Ningbo line. The company's original Jiangyun vessel sails the Shanghai-Ningbo line, departing from Shanghai every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Now, the Haixin vessel departs from Shanghai every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which will make shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo even more convenient in the future.</p>
<h3>The New "Fulilai" Vessel Arrives in Port, Carrying a Large Quantity of Vietnamese Rice</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The American Fulilai Steamship Company is a well-known agent for American Far East shipping agencies. After resuming business after the victory, it acts as an agent for the ships of four shipping companies, operating on the Pacific line, and also acts as an agent for ships transporting relief supplies for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. The company has built six new ships since the war, which have been completed one after another. It is said that four of them are 10,000-ton class, and the other two are also 7,000-8,000 tons. Now, the first new vessel, the "Studding Sail," is making its maiden voyage to Shanghai, and has brought a large quantity of Vietnamese rice, 4,500 tons from Saigon. It entered port at 8:00 a.m. yesterday and berthed at buoys 2 and 3 to unload.</p>
<h3>The Longhua Airport Runway Can Be Completed in May, With a Total Cost of 9 Billion, the Best Equipped in the Country</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Report] The construction of the north-south runway at Longhua Airport, Ministry of Transportation, which is 6,000 feet long and 150 feet wide, began in December last year. The laying of the gravel base began in early February of this year. To date, the gravel base has been largely completed, and the concrete pavement has completed one-fifth, i.e., sixty blocks (each block is 120 feet long and 25 feet wide, and six blocks can be completed per day). The entire project is expected to be completed in mid-May, and it will be the longest and most complete runway in the country.</p>
<p>The runway is not only particularly wide and long, but also can carry 45 tons, to meet the weight standards of the Constellation aircraft. The runway thickness is 11.2 inches, and the joints are thickened to 14.6 inches. A total of 12,000 tons of cement, 17,000 tons of sand, and 70,000 tons of gravel are required, but the gravel is currently short of 30,000 tons, which is the most difficult part of the project.</p>
<p>A Total of 2,000 Workers Are Employed</p>
<p>The total cost of the runway project is estimated to be 9 billion yuan, which is allocated solely by the Ministry of Transportation, and 8.7 billion yuan has already been received. According to the engineers there, this amount should be sufficient, and the remaining funds are intended to be used for the construction of taxiways along the runway. The project is divided into three sections: north, middle, and south, contracted by Baohua Construction Company, Tao Guiji Construction Factory, and China United Engineering Company, respectively.</p>
<p>The machinery used in the project, in addition to the twelve concrete mixers, seven crushers, and two road rollers rented by the contractors from the First Mechanical Road Construction Engineering Corps of the Highway Administration, and one road roller borrowed from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the site also purchased ten concrete mixers from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. A total of 2,000 workers are employed.</p>
<p>Lighting Equipment Inquiries to the United States</p>
<p>Yesterday, reporters accompanied members of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers to visit the site. They witnessed the workers' diligence and the grandeur of the site. It is said that the site intends to add night shifts in the future to complete this major project as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The runway lighting equipment is still being priced by manufacturers in the United States. Iron pipes have been purchased for the road crossings through the runway and buried under the road surface. Other works that should be continued for the Longhua Airport, such as the air station, parking apron, taxiways, east-west runways, etc., are still under detailed consideration by the Civil Aviation Administration.</p>
<h3>The Federation of Trade Unions Asks for Regulations on the Minimum Wage for Workers</h3>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has noticed that some manufacturers' wages are often overly harsh, leading to frequent disputes. The federation, concerned about this, recently submitted a request to the Municipal Labor-Management Arbitration Committee, requesting the establishment of a minimum wage standard to ensure the livelihood of workers. The original text briefly stated: "The wages of workers in various industries in the city," and the basic salary standards have been adjusted for most industries, but a few still follow the old habits, with excessively harsh treatment that does not meet the minimum standards. Moreover, there are different basic salaries for the same job, which is unfair, making it impossible for workers to maintain their minimum living standards, resulting in frequent disputes. If measures are not taken to solve this problem quickly, future disputes will inevitably be impossible to eliminate."</p>

<h3>The Doodles on the Walls of the Waiting Room Reveal the Anxiety and Depression of the Prisoners</h3>
<p>[Special Feature by this Newspaper] The anxiety, unease, and extreme nervousness of a prisoner before trial cannot be avoided, even if he is a person of strong reason and calmness on weekdays. The great thieves who kill and loot, the habitual petty thieves, and the prisoners who have committed crimes of injury and fraud, when squeezed into a small waiting room, mostly face the wall, silent, or look up in a daze, muttering to themselves. Some desperately bite their cuffs or the corners of their clothes, and some unconsciously pat the plaster on the wall. In short, laughter and crying have never been heard in the waiting room, and of course there is no high-level discussion. They are all single-mindedly planning for themselves, and never want to know the details of other people's cases. On weekdays in prison, prisoners often yell and make noise, and are the most difficult to manage, but in the waiting room, they are all unusually quiet. Experienced judicial police all know this, so they unanimously believe that guarding the waiting room is the easiest and least troublesome job.</p>
<p>The criminal court of the North Zhejiang Road Local Court is attached with a waiting room, allowing prisoners brought from the detention center to rest here while waiting for trial. It is not a large room, with a small hole in the door and iron bars on the window. The walls and ceiling are all painted black. I can't figure out why it must be black, but the passers-by here, under the cramped and uneasy mood, can just use it as a blackboard, scraping off the plaster on the wall and scribbling on the wall to kill their longest and most impatient time. This can also vent their anxious emotions and relax their overly tense nerves. Their works, in addition to irrelevant words and sentences such as "Wang Agen, you have a good life!" "Today I came to this room...", the rest are irregular money strip patterns. From these murals, it clearly tells how anxious and uneasy, and how depressed the prisoners waiting for trial are. The bad emotions increase their destructiveness. Batches of prisoners come in and out, causing the holes and ugly murals on the black wall to constantly increase and expand.</p>
<p>Previously, in the waiting room of the Capital High Court, the reporter had talked with Lin Bosheng, who has now been executed by shooting. Although he pretended to have a calm smile, the muscles on his cheeks were constantly twitching. The old-fashioned traitor Yin Rugeng frantically waved his fan in the waiting room, but the weather was not too hot that day. Liu Hangxia, the thief of the "Four Famous Mountains," spoke eloquently in court, compiling a set of confessions in the waiting room, facing the corner of the wall. Maysber, the "Foreign Tiger," muttered to himself in the waiting room, looking like he was suffering from neurasthenia. These group portraits are indeed quite interesting, but the bailiffs never look inside again, they are used to it.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation, Legal Questions (1) Mutual Promise for Life</h3>
<p>Jin Qiang asks: I have a girlfriend who is 19 years old. We have known each other for many years and have made a marriage pact. Her mother has already expressed her agreement, but the girl's father insists on opposing it. I have three questions. Please answer them. (1) If the mother decides alone and does not seek the father's consent to make the marriage pact, is it legally valid? (2) Does the girl, who is now 19 years old, have autonomy over her marriage? (3) If the girl's father firmly opposes, how should we deal with it?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Mi Xitong answers] (1) When a minor makes a marriage pact, the consent of the legal representative should be obtained. This is the provision of Article 974 of the Civil Code. If both parents are alive, the father should be the legal representative. (2) No. (3) There are two methods to solve it. A. While she is still a minor, ask a matchmaker to go to her father to intercede, or earnestly beg B. Wait until she is an adult, then according to the provisions of Article 972 of the Civil Code, she can make the marriage pact by herself.</p>
<p>(2) Redemption of Pawned Property</p>
<p>Chen Wenkang asks: In 1942, I was stationed in India with the army and lost contact with my family. When I returned home in August this year, I learned that my mother pawned the house to a Mr. Zhuang in March 1942 for 3,600 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, with a term of ten years. Because I have nowhere to live this time, I asked someone to redeem it from Mr. Zhuang. The other party demanded 14 shi of white rice, or 840,000 legal currency. Please ask: (1) Is Mr. Zhuang's request legal? (2) How should the pawn price of Central Reserve Certificates be converted? (3) Is there a standard for the cost of subsidies in the middle, and must it be converted with materials? (4) If Mr. Zhuang is unreasonable, how should we resolve it?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Mi Xitong answers] (1) It is not legal, but it depends on whether the calculation of his request is reasonable in human terms. (2) The government only stipulates the conversion of Central Reserve Certificates to national currency, and there are no other regulations. (3) According to local customs, there are no regulations. (4) You can apply to the court to resolve it.</p>

<p>Beware of Pickpockets When Riding a Bicycle</p>
<p>I am employed as a staff member at a bank on the Bund. On the 15th of this month, I carried 5 million yuan (currency) in a small cloth bag, tied to the front handlebar of my bicycle. Unexpectedly, when I arrived at the intersection of Beijing Road and Shanxi Road, I suddenly felt the rear tire of my bicycle being run over by a ball of broken wire. I stopped to remove it, and the cloth bag was gone. I then realized that the ball of broken wire was a planned theft tactic by pickpockets.

Therefore, I specifically ask your newspaper to grant a small space to publish this notice, alerting fellow bicycle riders, and hoping that the police will pay attention to it.

The minimum target is 500 million yuan, to facilitate the association's reconstruction efforts. A committee has been organized and members appointed to oversee the fundraising.

Fundraising is scheduled to begin on May 1st, with local association members assisting in the effort.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The China National Sports Advancement Association, as its original facilities were destroyed during the war, has identified a site on Jiange Road in Nanjing as its headquarters. Previously, the association's general secretary, Dong Shouyi, contacted the Executive Yuan. Recently, the Executive Yuan allocated a prefabricated house for the association's use. Most of the materials for this prefabricated house have arrived, but the underlying floor equipment is missing. This has been shipped to Shanghai and will soon be transferred to Nanjing. The association believes that its area and capacity are only sufficient to separate four or five small rooms, which is insufficient for its needs. Guan Songsheng, chairman of the construction committee, and members Zhang Xinfu and Huang Shaoliang, have designed an additional building and started leveling the ground on the large open space on Jiange Road to build a one-story building. The prefabricated house will be placed on top, creating a two-story building for temporary use. Once sufficient funds are raised, expansion and necessary equipment will be added.</p>

<h3>Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs Issue Measures to Prevent Securities Speculation and Manipulation; Stock Exchange Requests Temporary Suspension; Du Yuesheng and Wang Shengxin Go to Beijing to Present Everything</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs have stipulated measures to prevent securities speculation and manipulation. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has received notification from the ministries. The exchange convened an extraordinary meeting of the executive council yesterday (Sunday) morning to discuss the matter. Chairman Du Yuesheng presided, with executive council members Xu Jilun, Zhuang Shuhao, Xu Weiming, Zheng Xiaozhou, and acting general manager Wang Zhixin present. As a result of the discussion, it was determined that the Shanghai securities market is currently stable, and the measures notified by the ministries do not seem necessary in the current situation, to avoid stimulating market prices. It was decided to request a temporary suspension of implementation. The exchange believes that if stock market fluctuations remain normal, without sharp rises or falls, it should be properly maintained to cultivate its function of developing the capital market, so that it can absorb idle funds as much as possible and channel them into productive avenues. This would not only benefit industry but also help stabilize prices. It was resolved to submit an explanation to the ministries, requesting a temporary suspension of implementation. Chairman Du and acting general manager Wang left for Beijing last night to meet with senior officials of the two ministries to present everything in person.</p>
<h3>Content of Preventive Measures</h3>
<p>It is reported that the Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs, in order to prevent securities speculation, are considering temporary measures for the Shanghai Stock Exchange, including: (1) appropriately shortening the deferred delivery period to five or four days; (2) appropriately shortening the stock price fluctuation limit, from 15% to 12% or 10%; (3) temporarily suspending the establishment of a large transaction counter; (4) brokers must pay earnest money for both buying and selling, all in cash; (5) preventing brokers from engaging in excessive buying and selling, the stock exchange may decide to levy special securities margins on both the selling and buying parties; (6) strictly prohibiting off-exchange trading and insider transactions.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Ordered to Shut Down Provincial Bank Offices in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Reorganization of De Fu and Bayer Factories Still Without Progress</h3>
<p>The De Fu and Bayer pharmaceutical factories liquidation office, after receiving orders to prepare for reorganization, has been delayed for months due to various reasons. It is understood that De Fu Yanghang itself has pigments in stock, estimated to be worth more than 5.5 million yuan. The inventory of Xiaoxiang Bank that has been cleared out is worth 200,000 yuan. Since the reorganization began, the pigments have not been distributed once. Recently, the market price of pigments has plummeted. If the office releases them again, it will affect the industrial market. The office intends to distribute them once more when the market price stabilizes. The office recently purchased a sodium sulfide plant in Qingdao, preparing it as a subsidiary factory after the reorganization, specializing in the production of sodium sulfide drugs. On the Bayer pharmaceutical factory side, it has distributed drugs twice during the reorganization preparation period. The factory's inventory is estimated to be worth more than 500,000 yuan. If the reorganization date is extended, the office also plans to distribute drugs again in the near future to avoid a shortage of medicines in the market.</p>

<h3>Wool Textile Industry Association Established: Raw Material Allocation Committee</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Limited Allocation Office of the Supervisory Commission has stipulated a wool import limit of US$1.4 million for February to April this year. This includes wool, wool tops, and wool yarn. The allocation targets include all Chinese and foreign privately-owned wool spinning mills nationwide. Therefore, the result of the limit allocation is less than one-tenth of the national factory needs. In view of this, the Chinese and foreign wool spinning industry established a Raw Material Allocation Committee for Wool at the city's Wool Spinning Industry Association at 4:00 PM the other day. Cheng Nianpeng, Tang Junyuan, Tang Weizhang, Wu Shandi, Chen Yuanqing, Lobaisen, Kaise Wei, and 15 others attended. After discussion, it was decided: (1) Regarding the allocation of raw materials, it is planned to investigate the actual operating needs of each factory to allocate raw materials accordingly. According to the investigation, there are about 80 wool spinning mills in Tianjin, Lanzhou, Shanghai, Chongqing, and other places (more than 50 in Shanghai). Currently, fine spinning raw materials require wool, coarse spinning raw materials require wool tops, and weaving machines require wool yarn. Wool yarn is the final product of wool tops and wool. Therefore, the US$1.4 million limit will be based on this relationship to determine the priority of allocation. (2) The regulations concerning required amounts: fine spinning spindles require 0.4 pounds of wool tops per spindle for a ten-hour workday. Coarse spinning spindles require 0.6 pounds. Knitting yarn spindles require 1.5 pounds. (3) It was decided that 45 wool tops would be calculated at 55 pence per pound, 64 wool tops at 125 pence, and 60 washed wool at 60 pence. The foreign exchange needed by each factory can be converted to US dollars based on this amount.</p>
<h3>Taiyuan Commodity Prices Fall</h3>

Merchants are all frowning and sighing that it is difficult to maintain daily expenses and responsibilities. The gold and jewellery industry is particularly miserable. Gold jewelry cannot be sold because the black market price of gold bars is higher than the listed price. The sale of gold bars is strictly prohibited without a formal market, so only silver jewelry is sold, but buyers are scarce. More than half of the 26 stores have applied to close, and the rest are considering whether to close or change their business.</p>
<h3>China Tobacco Company: Overview of the Past Year</h3>

<p>The Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association recently stated that its members urgently need dyes and chemical products. Since the implementation of import management, these goods have been decreasing daily. Those who hold goods manipulate prices, and market prices have soared, affecting production and increasing costs, making it difficult for industry to survive. The Limited Allocation Office of the Supervisory Commission previously only approved the import limit for February to April, but there are no regulations regarding the overall quantity. The association states that the dyeing and weaving industry is one of the national industries, and if there are no clear regulations on the import limits of required raw materials, factories will not be able to survive. Therefore, it has investigated the types and quantities needed each month, formulated reasons, and requested the allocation committee to quickly determine the quota allocation. The reasons and required product names are listed below:</p>
<p>Dyes and chemical products are necessary for dyeing, printing, and finishing projects in each member factory of the association. The consumption accounts for more than 80% of other industries. In the past, during the period of free import, the industry directly ordered from importers. Because the sources were smooth, there was no difficulty in adopting them. Since import restrictions, the bottom line in Shanghai has become thinner day by day, and actual sales have been strong, resulting in those who hold goods taking the opportunity to raise prices, making the industry's business scope greatly controlled. Such measures do not conform to the government's goal of supporting the national industry. If these main raw materials are further delayed and not determined, the needs of the industry will still be in the hands of importers, and the domestic dyeing and weaving industry will not have similar categories. Currently, for the cigarette industry and the wool spinning industry in the city, the Supervisory Commission has already stipulated the import limits for tobacco leaves and wool. According to the monthly production volume of each factory, their allocations are separately approved, and each factory is notified to directly sign contracts with importers. After the limited allocation office approves them, it issues import licenses. This measure is extremely appropriate. It can avoid the malpractice of taking the opportunity to raise prices and reduce the cost of industrial products. Now, the above-mentioned raw materials required by each member factory of the association should be treated equally and handled in accordance with precedents. The association has compiled the types and quantities of raw materials required each month and submitted them for rapid approval. It is requested that the quota be transferred to the association and distributed to each factory according to its output. The names of the required raw materials are as follows: (Dyes) vulcanized yuan, Shilin blue with Haichang blue, Naftol AS, Naftol salt and base, direct dyes with salt base, vulcanized dyes. (Raw material chemicals) caustic soda, soda ash, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, vulcanized alkali, bleaching powder, insurance powder, glacial acetic acid, sodium perborate, sodium nitrite, sodium hypochlorite, sodium red alum, aniline oil.</p>
<h3>Wool Arrival and Sales Volumes</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] A large quantity of wool has arrived. Merchants are taking advantage of the large quantity to purchase for export. Transactions are very lively. Shandong wool is 50,000 yuan per batch, Huzhou wool is 123,000 yuan for top-grade goods per dan, and 110,000 yuan for medium-grade goods.</p>
<h3>Industrial Raw Material Downturn</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Industrial raw materials have been weak for nearly a month, and the ability to absorb them is still difficult to improve. Prices continue to decline. For foreign orders, the US restrictions on goods exports are more severe than before. According to market rumors, the head positions of many factories are suppressed by expensive items etc., and it is difficult to cut them off with painful resolution. Therefore, raw materials are not only unable to be absorbed, but existing raw materials are being sold to the raw materials market. Yesterday, caustic soda (American goods) fell to 3.6 million yuan per barrel. There are also many emerging goods, and there is still a downward trend. The price of insurance powder once rose to 2 million yuan per dan, but now 800,000 can buy it. The sales volume of soda ash is also low. Glycerin and styrene, the peak season is over, and market prices are still difficult to stabilize. Zinc oxide is still used in rubber factories and the paint industry, so the price still stands at a high price of 10 million per ton. Ammonium sulfate has issued frequent sales orders, and the price looks high.</p>
<h3>Central Government Discusses How to Use First Batch of Japanese Reparations Materials: China Can Obtain 1.35 Million Tons</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The amount of the first batch of reparations from Japan and its allocation will be decided in the short term, and China will obtain 1.35 million tons. The central government has been discussing the budget for the use of this reparations material for a long time, but it has not made a final decision as of Song Ziwen's resignation. It is said that the regulations include 60 billion for freight and 300 billion for installation costs. The Real Estate Bureau is determined to make good use of the first batch of materials so that China can be in a favorable position when discussing total reparations in the future. The transportation of materials is not a problem, the difficulty lies in its use. According to an estimate by an expert, the cost of use needs to be more than 20 times the cost of freight. When the total compensation is implemented in the future, China can obtain at least 3 million tons of materials, and the number will be even greater if light industry is included. Therefore, the relevant authorities are now racking their brains and trying to raise this fund in various ways.</p>
<p>The old batch of dismantled reparations materials accounts for 30% of the total reparations, a decision made in August of last year. Regarding the implementation of the compensation process, there was a dispute between the Scientific and Economic Group and the Foreign Property Management Group within the Allied Headquarters. It has now been stipulated that the former is responsible for design and allocation, and the latter is responsible for execution, with the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Headquarters presiding. The first batch of dismantled materials does not include transportation, mining, or light industry. In fact, MacArthur's headquarters is quite encouraging the recovery of the Japanese textile and shipbuilding industries. For example, last spring, the headquarters invited representatives from Britain and India to inspect the Japanese textile industry and advocated that Japan should maintain a production capacity of 3.5 million spindles. In terms of ships, Japan currently has 1 million tons of seagoing vessels, but headquarters hopes that Japan will have 3 million tons and is trying to encourage its shipbuilding industry to recover. Based on Japan's existing equipment, it can build at least 350,000 tons per year.</p>
<p>The issue of Japan's total reparations is not simple and has not yet been discussed. The central issue of compensation is to determine the standard of living that Japan should have after the implementation of reparations. The Chinese delegation advocates 1914 and 1920, but the US holds different views and may decide on 1930 to 1934 in the future. The later it is, the greater the productivity and the more favorable it will be for Japan. The Allied Headquarters has two views: (1) hoping that Japan can become a self-sufficient country; (2) hoping that Japan can bear the military expenses. Therefore, it advocates leniency in the implementation of compensation.</p>
<h3>UNRRA Continues to Send Fishing Boats, 15 Vessels to Arrive in China</h3>
<p>UNRRA, in order to assist in the revival of China's fishing industry, has granted China 83 new-style fishing boats, managed and operated by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA). These boats are being prepared for lease. Yesterday, CRRRA received a telegram from UNRRA stating: UNRRA still has 36 new-style fishing boats that can be allocated to China for transport. Recently, Director General Rooks has approved the allocation of 15 to China, which have now set sail and will arrive soon. The remaining 21 vessels will arrive successively this summer.</p>
<h3>US$40 Million Ship Loan: US Reopens Negotiations with China, 159 Ocean Liners Available for Purchase</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources in the shipping industry: The long-pending US$40 million ship loan from the United States to China has been revived and negotiations have resumed. This US$40 million can purchase 159 ocean liners of various sizes, totaling 810,000 tons. These include 32 ocean liners of over 10,000 tons, more than 20 of over 5,000 tons, and the remainder being over 3,000 tons. A formal agreement on this loan is expected by the end of April. Once these ships arrive in China, domestic passenger and cargo transportation capacity will be more than sufficient. The shipping industry is currently planning to form a joint company to manage these ships effectively, open domestic and international routes, and establish China's position in the international shipping industry, aiming to replace Japan's pre-war international position in shipping.</p>
<h3>China Salt Industry Corporation Established: Merger and Reorganization of Northeast and North China Companies, Total Salt Production Expected to Exceed 9 Million Dan This Year</h3>
<p>The enemy's Northeast Salt Industry Company and North China Salt Industry Company have been taken over by officials dispatched by the Ministry of Finance. The takeover has been completed. The two organizations have been merged to form the China Salt Industry Corporation, with Yao Yuanlun as the General Manager. To facilitate business operations, four branch offices will be established in North China, Northeast China, Qingdao, and Taiwan. The branches in Tianjin (North China) and Shenyang (Northeast China) are being actively prepared. It is learned that the salt field area under the jurisdiction of the former North China Salt Industry Company is 96,000 mu in Dagu, 34,560 mu in Tanggu, 52,320 mu in Hangu, and 110,704 mu in Daqinghe, totaling 293,584 mu. Except for the Daqinghe salt fields, which cannot be restored due to unstable security, the remaining salt fields are planned to be fully reopened. The characteristics of the North China salt fields are: (1) The Dagu salt fields have been fully converted to permanent operation, using electric pumps to extract water. (2) The remaining salt fields are also large, continuous tracts of land with excellent water extraction equipment. The production volume this year is estimated at 7 million dan, accounting for half of the Changlu output. The salt field area owned by the Northeast Salt Industry Company is 48,512 mu in the Suizhong area, 125,760 mu in the Yingkou area, 65,792 mu in the Fuxian area, 10,624 mu in the Zhuanghe area, and 25,200 mu in the Jinzhou area, totaling 501,888 mu. Except for the Jinzhou area, which is still occupied by the Communist forces, the remaining salt fields are planned to be repaired and gradually reopened. These salt fields all use electric pumps to extract brine. If fully restored, the annual salt production could reach 20 million dan. With restoration just beginning this year, a production of 2.5 million dan is expected. 60% of the salt produced by these two companies was shipped to Japan, with the remainder sold domestically to regulate the food supply for the people.</p>
<h3>Hunan Manganese Powder Sells Well</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Hunan-produced manganese powder is of excellent quality and meets industrial needs. A large amount has arrived this year, and sales are widespread. Last year, due to poor transportation conditions, the cost of transporting each ton to Shanghai accounted for one-fifth of the price. Conditions are slightly better this year, so a steady supply is expected in the future. The current price for the best grade is 2 million yuan per ton, while lower grades range from 1.4 million to 1.6 million yuan. Transportation costs account for about 800,000 yuan per ton. The price of the top-grade product is 1 to 2 times higher than last year's price of 600,000 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Weasel Skins are Firm, Shanghai Bristles are Stable</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Tight supply for weasel skins has come from Europe, merchants are striving to buy, and market prices are becoming firmer. Yesterday's market price was 37,000 yuan per pair. Badger and sable skins also followed the upward trend. The New York market for weasel skins remains soft, with 18-inch skins priced at US$2.50 and 14-inch skins at US$1.15. Shanghai bristles are facing stock depletion, and the New York market is active. Exporters are frequently replenishing their stocks, and prices remain stable.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Yesterday's market price for lake lambskins was 11,000 yuan per piece. It is reported that the New York market price is US$1.25 per piece, making exports profitable and transactions frequent.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Industry Sluggish</h3>
<p>Labor and Management Gather to Discuss Solutions</p>
<p>Amid the general economic downturn in the city's industry and commerce, the crisis in the cigarette industry has become acute. Even foreign-owned cigarette factories cannot stem the tide. In addition to the largest foreign-owned Yizhong Cigarette Factory having completely ceased operations, the Huacheng Cigarette Company, a well-known domestic giant in the cigarette industry, has also implemented work reductions, operating for only five hours per day. Some cigarette factories are laying off workers to survive. Some small factories operate for only two hours per day, essentially being in a state of semi-shutdown. Therefore, if no countermeasures are taken to remedy this deteriorating situation, the number of unemployed workers will greatly increase. It is reported that the Production Promotion Association has scheduled a meeting today to bring together labor and management in the cigarette industry to discuss rescue measures.</p>
<h3>Shantou Drawn-Thread Work Industry: Over 30,000 People Have Resumed Work</h3>
<p>Shantou drawn-thread work is a unique product of Guangdong Province. It involves drawing threads from fine cloth to weave various patterns and make handkerchiefs, tablecloths, bed sheets, and sleepwear, which are exported to Europe and the United States. Due to its exquisite craftsmanship, it is very popular and widely sold. Before the war, over 400,000 people in the Chaozhou region of eastern Guangdong relied on this industry for their livelihood. Due to wartime displacement, only over 30,000 people have resumed work. According to 1940 statistics, the annual output was valued at over 80 million yuan (US$2 million). Calculated at current prices, this would be 16.7 billion yuan. However, this year's output is unlikely to exceed 4.2 billion yuan. Furthermore, raw material costs are high and controlled by foreign merchants. The local government has considered implementing export incentives, but they have not been effective. Before the war, imported linen cloth was mostly used for drawn-thread work, but due to high costs, locally produced summer cloth is now mostly used. In the past, designs often followed traditional methods and lacked artistic value. If reforms can be made, and with government guidance to improve quality, the annual increase in income could be considerable.</p>

<h3>National Defense Iron Fence, Industrial Backbone: Anshan Iron and Steel Smelting City</h3>
<p>— Special Dispatch from Shenyang, March 15th, by Our Northeast Correspondent, Han Qingtao</p>
<p>Anshan's iron and steel industry is the iron fence of China's national defense, the backbone of industry, and is even more connected to China's entire economic future. The central government has increasingly attached importance to it, as evidenced by the recent continuous investigations and strengthening of its reconstruction and production capacity.</p>
<p>In order to report the actual situation to the people of the country, I, as a reporter, made a special trip from Shenyang to Anshan and visited for three days. Three days was not enough to see the whole picture, but the scale is large enough. When I stepped into the steel plant, the first thing I saw was the cranes emitting steam, roaring back and forth, unloading the heavy, damaged objects next to the iron-smelting furnaces. Many workers were standing on two potentially repairable iron-smelting furnaces, hammering and welding, with "ding-dong" and "clang" sounds forming a chorus.</p>
<p>In the air inside the steel plant, huge electric cranes were running horizontally, moving or clearing debris. The rumbling sound vibrated the eardrums. A small rolling mill was burning many semi-finished steel bars. A red steel bar was hooked out, following the rotating axle, drilled into the rolling mill, went in, came out, and became a long snake, then followed the axle again into several rows of rolling mills. Skilled workers, with quick hands, rolled it into the desired shape. When I visited, they were rolling steel bars used in buildings.</p>
<p>In the machine factory, rows of lathes on the left and right were turning train axles. In another factory, a one-and-a-half-ton steam hammer and several larger ones were hammering the axles, thumping and thumping, making the steel dense and solid, and then sent to the lathe factory.</p>
<p>A iron foundry has an electric motor, grabbing a large iron pot, with a pot full of molten iron, moved left and right by pulleys, pouring iron juice, manufacturing wheels and hooks. The work is quite tense and busy.</p>
<p>The steel company now has ten departments: mining, ore dressing, ironmaking, chemical, steelmaking, steel rolling, power, transportation, labor, and heavy industry. It owns mining sites such as Gongchangling, Yingtaoyuan, and Dagushan. The ore dressing department has workshops for reduction, ore dressing, medium ore, sintering, and pelletizing. The ironmaking department has workshops for pig iron and granular iron. The chemical department has workshops for coal washing, coke, gas absorption, asphalt, sulfuric acid, xylene, and ammonium sulfate.</p>
<p>The steelmaking department includes steelmaking and ferroalloy workshops. The steel rolling department includes workshops for ingot casting, large shapes, first and second small shapes, medium plates, and thin plates. The power department has a power plant. The heavy industry department includes the medium steel plate workshop, iron casting workshop, steel casting workshop, machine workshop, cold working workshop, oxygen manufacturing workshop, analysis institute, construction engineering machinery section, and substation equipment, which were originally the "Okura Heavy Industries Co., Ltd." Truly a grand sight!</p>
<p>Among these departments, some are irreparable and need to await compensation from Japan. According to General Manager Shao Yizhou, "The Northeast can account for one-fifth of the national allocation of Japanese compensation, and Anshan can get 75,000 tons. The most urgent need is about 45,000 tons, and the remaining secondary need is about 30,000 tons, which can be urgently transported to Anshan!"</p>
<p>The repairable ones have already started working, starting to move, with electricity, fire, steam, and human power all mixed together. Everything is for reconstruction, for resumption of work, showing a bright future everywhere!</p>
<p>Iron and Steel Production Work</p>
<p>The iron plant originally had nine iron-smelting furnaces. In addition to those that were dismantled and destroyed, it is planned to repair the first and second furnaces (each furnace produces 400 tons per day), as well as all accompanying equipment, with a capacity of 280,000 tons per year.</p>
<p>Demolition and repair have recently been supervised. The clearing work of the damaged parts of each furnace has lasted for more than a month and has now been largely completed. The repair and installation work is now in progress.</p>
<p>The steelmaking department plans to repair three open-hearth furnaces, and prepare refining furnaces and mixing furnaces, as well as all accompanying equipment, with a capacity of 270,000 tons of steel ingots per year. In order to supplement the insufficient gas, four new gas furnaces are also being installed.</p>
<p>The steel rolling department plans to repair the ingot rolling machine, the first small steel rolling machine, the second medium steel plate rolling machine of the foundry, and all accompanying equipment, with a capacity of 500,000 tons of steel ingots per year. After the repair, it can produce 100,000 tons of medium-sized steel, 70,000 tons of small-sized steel, and 30,000 tons of medium-sized steel plates per year.</p>
<p>Shao Yizhou said: "The small steel rolling department has been in operation for some time. The semi-finished products—steel ingots—stored by the Japanese can be used until the end of May. The steelmaking department can start work in June, which can keep the steel rolling department working until the end of August. At that time, the first smaller iron-smelting furnace, which can produce 400 tons per day, can be repaired and start smelting iron, so the steel plant can continue, and the steel rolling plant will have no worries about raw materials!"</p>
<p>Successful Processing of Poor Ore</p>
<p>The Anshan Iron and Steel Plant's utilization of poor ore is a major feature. From an economic point of view, the poor ore processing procedures are more numerous and the cost may be a bit higher, but because the mining costs of rich ore tunnels are higher, poor ore saves labor. For example, the Dagushan mine south of Anshan is a good example of poor ore mining. As a result, the cost of poor and rich ore is almost equal, so the Japanese once boasted to the world about the success of their "Anshan-style poor ore processing method."</p>
<p>The ore dressing plant is the main base for processing poor ore. The processing steps are to crush the ore into powder, the magnet absorbs the iron powder, and then the concentrated magnetic iron powder is burned into ore. As a result, manpower is used to turn poor ore into rich ore.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the machines in the ore dressing plant have been almost completely destroyed. Most of the parts need to be supplied from abroad, and the gas is insufficient, so the repair will take a long time. Therefore, at present, it is only limited to sorting and storage work.</p>
<p>Before the ore dressing plant is repaired, the raw materials required for the first phase of the ironmaking plan will be supplied by high-quality iron ore produced from the Gongchangling, Yingtaoyuan (northeast of Anshan), and Xiaofangshen mines. The planned annual output of Gongchangling mining is 450,000 tons (for ironmaking and open-hearth furnace). Because the size of the iron ore used in the iron-smelting furnace is 50 to 10 mm, the mine focuses on repairing the ore crushing equipment.</p>
<p>The by-product powder ore is planned to be made into pellet ore in a part of the pellet ore plant in the ore dressing plant to supply the iron-smelting furnace. Fluorite, manganese ore, limestone, dolomite, and magnesite are planned to be used from existing materials, so the mines will not be repaired for the time being. Only the first-grade silica, because there is not much existing material and it is needed earlier, is planned to be repaired in the Jin-Rehe area and the Jilin area.</p>
<p>In addition to repairing all the necessary equipment for ironmaking and steelmaking and mining equipment, the company's first phase of the plan also verified the amount of existing materials in other medium and small factories, the supply and demand situation in China, and the extent of repair, and formulated a part of the factories to be prioritized for resumption of work.</p>
<p>The Sorrow of the Coking Plant</p>
<p>The coking plant is a very large plant. In order to prompt Japan to surrender as soon as possible, the Allied B-29 heavy bombers flew from Chengdu to Anshan to drop bombs several times. Some bombs fell to the east of the railway, and some hit the coking furnaces in the coking plant. The coking furnaces were partially destroyed.</p>
<p>The coking plant bears the heavy responsibility of all coking, and is executed by three plants: coal transportation, coal washing, and coking furnace. It also has by-product departments to recover by-products from the gas, and uses this by-product to process and manufacture chemical products. It also has a gas office to use the surplus gas to supply the residents of Anshan City.</p>
<p>Before the coal coking plant was taken over, it suffered heavy losses. All the coal transportation and coal washing equipment had been destroyed. If other equipment can be repaired, it can still restore the production capacity of 1,000 tons of coke per day.</p>
<p>The plant has formulated a phased resumption plan. The goal of the first phase of the resumption plan is to produce 250,000 tons of lump coke and 50,000 tons of powder coke per year, and produce by-product chemical products. It has been actively implemented since October 1946, and it is expected that mining can be started in phases this month. It is stipulated that the first phase of the resumption work will be completed four months after mining begins.</p>
<p>Second phase of the resumption plan: The goal of this phase is to produce 500,000 tons of coke and by-product chemical products per year, which is expected to be completed in one year, and then the third phase of work will begin. The goal of the third phase is to produce 2 million tons of coke and by-product chemical products per year.</p>
<p>When I visited the coking plant, I walked up to the coking furnace, stepped into the chemical room, and leaned against the cooling absorption tower, as if walking in a large forest, like "Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden," feeling gloomy and terrible, and also feeling small. I kept asking the factory director and Mr. He, who enthusiastically explained and guided us.</p>
<p>The coke and gas for steelmaking and steelmaking, as well as chemical products, completely rely on this coking plant, but transportation in the Northeast is difficult. In the past, a coal train would run in every two hours day and night, but now a coal train may not come in 20 hours.</p>
<p>After repeated requests from the Assets Committee, the Northeast Headquarters is also making its best efforts and decided to supply 510,000 tons of lump coal from Fushun and other fields to the Anshan Coking Plant and other places this year. It is estimated that there will be 38,000 tons in March, a little more in April, and even more in May. The plant is praying for a solution to transportation, otherwise everything will be over.</p>
<p>The Northeast needs stability, and Anshan needs stability even more. In instability, the work of heavy industry cannot be carried out, and at the same time, I am afraid that the tragedy will be staged again. According to the person in charge of the steel company, "If the communist army had not entered Anshan twice in May last year and destroyed the steel plant, then ironmaking and steelmaking could have started long ago. By today, there must be many achievements. If there is another decisive destruction, then everything will be irreparable!"</p>
<p>Everything is for Industry</p>
<p>The nine iron-smelting furnaces of the iron plant, the rows of chimneys of the steel plant, the cooling absorption tower of the coking plant, the wide-mouthed cooling tower of the power plant, and the tall gas storage tanks, are huge and towering into the sky, forming a spectacular sight. On the flat ground and high hills, there are large and small factory buildings of unknown number, occupying a large area, making the surroundings appear unusually small.</p>
<p>We saw the railways surrounding the iron factory and Anshan, some leading to the mining area, and some going to and from other raw material production sites. The fork roads for unloading and loading are even as dense as spider webs. If the railways owned by these steel plants themselves are connected together, the total length can be 438 kilometers. In addition, there are 170 kilometers of military railway lines, which are not included. The factory area is truly grand enough.</p>
<p>During the day, heat is flying, black smoke is lingering, filling the sky, and the molten iron flowing out of the iron furnace, with red light, is blazing and shining with sparks, cutting through the darkness. Great, beautiful, and moving! Southeast of Anshan, the hills are overlapping, and a little further away there are mountains of various heights, which is the famous "Qianshan" scenic spot in southern Liaoning. To the northwest is a vast plain, bordering the ancient capital of Liaoyang in the north, and the famous "Tanggangzi" hot spring in the south.</p>
<p>Anshan City is a famous heavy industrial city, and the city scene is special. It is very clear that everything is for the steel plant. The main components of the city streets are the residences of the steel plant and other factory employees, as well as institutions for the employees' livelihood, recreation, and medical care.</p>
<p>A long Zhongchang Road divides the area into east and west regions. The eastern one is the Tiedong District, and the western one is called the Tiexi District. In the Tiexi District, except for a few large residences for Japanese workers in the empty places, the rest are all the residences and shops of our compatriots.</p>
<p>The residents in this area are either factory employees or their families, or some merchants who indirectly rely on the factory employees for their livelihoods. There is a wide street running east-west, reaching the western suburbs, and there are also many vertical and horizontal streets, which are generally considered neat.</p>
<p>Steel Industry Zone</p>
<p>The northwest of the Tiexi District is the location of steel and other heavy industries. On a dirt hill, several rows of black factory buildings like corridors are covered, undulating with the mountains, forming a spectacular sight. That is the ore dressing plant, where the world-famous "Anshan-style poor ore processing method" is processed.</p>
<p>Walking north along the asphalt road, a row of white buildings blocks the way. That is what the residents call the "White House," which used to be the office of the Showa Steel Works and is now the office of the Steel Company of the Assets Committee. Passing the White House and turning the corner are the nine iron-smelting furnaces of the steel plant, standing there like giants. To the west is the location of the power plant, and the cooling towers and gas storage towers are also huge. Behind a row of chimneys is the steel plant. The coking plant is to the east and west, and the scale is even larger. The construction is very special. All the coke and gas used by the factories are supplied here.</p>
<p>Further north. Various heavy industrial factories stand in great numbers. In the past, they were the factories on the periphery of the steel plant, but now they are completely included within the steel company, extending all the way to Lishan Station.</p>
<p>In this area, there are trains and trams, as well as cars, connecting every distant place. It used to be tense and busy, but now it is not so convenient and not so tense.</p>
<p>Blessing to Stand Up Again</p>
<p>The Tiedong District is a special area. In the past, in the eyes of the compatriots living in Tiexi, it was a noble and mysterious place. Because there was no place for our compatriots here. The Japanese simply did not allow our compatriots to enter the Tiedong District.</p>
<p>Look, the beautiful small western-style houses are surrounded by spire-shaped pine and cypress trees, and some are planted with small, low shrubs, or rows of tall poplars that pierce the sky and form a lane. There are no walls and no wooden fences. Walking here is like visiting a beautiful garden.</p>
<p>Standing on the top of the "Yingbingguan" (Guest House) building at the east end, you can see the eastern suburbs and the mountains far and near. The south side is also very good. So today, many people who come to Anshan say in unison: "This is a very ideal and beautiful paradise!"</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities called the senior Japanese in the steel plant and other factories to live in this beautiful environment and enjoy themselves as much as possible, so that they would be grateful and do their best to work for the factory. Another reason, perhaps, is to say: the "children of God" are unusual.</p>
<p>Now, although it is covered with white snow and the houses are somewhat damaged and empty, it has not been able to erase and conceal its beauty.</p>
<p>Anshan was originally a desolate grassland. After the railway was opened, people gradually settled here, and later it developed into an industrial city. Now the area of Anshan City is 123,247,300 square meters.</p>
<p>The Japanese, in view of the sharp increase in population and the continued upward trend of various industries, formulated a large urban plan, dividing parts of Liaoyang and Haicheng into it. The total area is 459,500,000 square meters, but before it could be realized, it was destroyed due to the urgency of the war.</p>
<p>After the restoration, the Anshan Municipal Government was established on April 10, 1946. The population plummeted from 280,000. First, more than 70,000 Japanese withdrew. Because the factories could not be fully started, some workers left Anshan. At present, there are at most 200,000 people.</p>
<p>The municipal government's finances are very difficult. In 1946, there was a shortage of more than 37 million circulating bills. The administrative expenses budget for 1947 is 200 million circulating bills. It is estimated that at most 80 million circulating bills can be collected from land tax and local tax. Now the administrative staff and teachers have not been paid for three months. The person in charge of the municipal government said: "During the puppet Manchukuo period, the national treasury and the steel plant provided subsidies to the municipal administrative expenses. The current order is that tax items cannot be increased, and there is no way to close the financial sources. A clever woman cannot cook without rice. As for construction, it is even more out of the question!"</p>
<p>The primary and secondary schools in Anshan are still in a very difficult situation and are being destroyed. They are planning to restore them. The steel and steel plants are even more devastated and are being rebuilt. I wish this iron capital of China a speedy recovery of health and stand up again in the Northeast!</p>
<h3>Look at This Clean Land of Guangxi</h3>
<p>— Dispatch from Guilin, August 8th, by Our Reporter Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>For a series of days, the sky here has been frighteningly gloomy. At midnight, the storms swept the sky, chilling people to the bone, often suggesting the destruction of the sun, landslides, and tsunamis... It's mid-March, and we still haven't seen the trees sprouting new buds. Who knows when the scenery of a dormant field will wake up?</p>
<p>At the opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Guangxi Provincial Party Department, Chairman Huang candidly pointed out in his policy report: "All reconstruction work in Guangxi is only in the planning stage." Natural disasters and wars have made everything lag behind by who knows how many years. To realize the plan, to restore the weather, we must look up and hope that God will bless us not to have another disaster, and hope that the central government will give us a few more coins; looking down, we must hope that the people can endure unparalleled suffering, and hope that the officials will be less "hands-on," and then everything will be possible. From a political point of view, Guangxi is still a clean land. Even if there are two more Mao Zedongs, it is still as Mr. Huang Xuchu said: "Guangxi has no so-called 'liberated area,' which is clear proof of political stability." To ensure that this proof is always a proof, the provincial government is printing a comprehensive policy program, reminiscent of the eight large characters "Build Guangxi, Revive China" that were raised high into the clouds ten years ago. However, the people are much more thoughtful!</p>
<p>Special Envoy Liu Visits Guilin: Talking About His Impressions of This Trip</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Wendao, with a mandate from the central government, came to Guilin. In addition to enjoying all kinds of the highest honors (it is rare to see one or two specially appointed officials visiting Guangxi all year round, so it is no wonder that it is so grand), he stayed for ten days. After the entertainment, the reporter asked about his impressions of Guangxi. Special Envoy Liu unhesitatingly read: "The people of Guangxi are diligent, thrifty, capable, lively and energetic, the social order is stable, and they are led by wise leaders. The future must be extremely bright!" When asked about his opinions on building Guangxi, Mr. Liu smiled and said: "Guangxi already has very good construction plans, and there is no need for more opinions." The vast sky made the people of Guangxi couldn't help but be excited. Now, Mr. Liu is about to return by plane. In the hearts of the small citizens of Guilin, there is only one thought: They are all thinking, "The central government will definitely understand our suffering from now on."</p>
<p>Air Transport One Mile: Needs Eight Angles of US Dollars</p>
<p>From the ground to the sky, the sky of Guangxi is lively enough. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) Air Transport Brigade has stations in Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning, carrying passengers and cargo. It costs eight angles of US dollars for one mile. It costs more than one million to go to Nanjing, so the retail sales are quite sluggish. It is currently being improved. After the improvement, the number of people flying around will increase, and even the calmest place will be a little better.</p>
<p>Looking in four directions, it feels like there is a new life waiting to grow everywhere. However, how to clear the clouds and see the blue sky still awaits the efforts of those who are interested.</p>

<h3>Unemployed Technicians Call for Enrollment</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I am an unemployed worker, 22 years old this year, from Wuxi, Jiangsu. During the Anti-Japanese War, I fled to Guiyang with my brother. A friend introduced me to the Salt Bureau to study mechanical repair for two years, and I worked at the Huasheng Company in Kunming for two years. When the Anti-Japanese War ended, I resigned and returned home. I have now learned that the Mechanical Management and Communications Office of the Highway Bureau is recruiting 100 people: (1) junior high school graduates or those who can drive, (2) junior high school graduates or senior elementary school graduates with two years of repair experience. I think I meet the second item, so I immediately applied. However, on the day of the exam, the authorities said that I must take English and algebra. May I ask, how can a senior elementary school student have this ability? Is it necessary to be so strict to learn driving skills? Therefore, I urge the Highway Bureau to take care of unemployed technicians and relax the enrollment path. (Wu Bogou)</p>
<p>Reply by Mail to Zheng Fei: Regarding your letter pointing out that there are often shortages and damages in Shanghai-Xuzhou intermodal parcel transport, we have received a letter from the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration, saying: "After checking the sections mentioned in the original letter, because the location, date, and parcel ticket number are not accurate, and the shortage and damage were not declared to the arrival station when picking up the goods, it is impossible to investigate thoroughly. In addition to instructing our subordinates to pay attention in the future, and writing to the Jinpu Railway to pay attention to improvement, we hereby reply." Please contact them.</p>
<h3>On the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (NRRA) Joint General Meeting on Social Welfare Work and Review of the NRRA's Emergency Relief and Welfare Work in the Past Year (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Liu Dewei, Zhan Dehou</p>
<p>A few days ago, the UNRRA and NRRA jointly convened a social welfare work meeting, inviting the Ministry of Social Affairs, national social affairs departments/bureaus, national public and private welfare organizations, and social work professors to participate. Over two hundred representatives from all walks of life frankly shared their vivid work experiences and earnestly discussed the future work directions and steps. This move is indeed an unprecedented grand event in China's social welfare work field. The meeting included social welfare work designers, administrators, field workers, and scholars. In short, they are professionals who take increasing people's welfare as their own duty. It is hoped that they will firmly remember that this profession is sacred, and they must not make the mistake of being jealous of each other during the discussion. At this time when the people are in deep suffering, how to cherish the opportunity and not let this meeting become an empty spectacle, but let it generate an epoch-making force is very important.</p>
<p>In addition to placing high hopes on this meeting, we need to look back at the NRRA's welfare work. What has it given us this year? This type of work is generally divided into two major categories: one is direct relief, and the other is welfare for children and the elderly.</p>
<p>The so-called direct relief refers to the scope of relief and assistance that can be obtained without any cost or labor. Naturally, it is limited to the recovered areas, and the targets are poor refugees.</p>
<p>The biggest problem in carrying out direct relief work is determining the targets. In this country where most people only have the distinction between the very poor and the less poor, who can you say does not need relief? Impoverished public school teachers and cultural figures are good at organizing themselves to put pressure on various branch offices to demand relief, while poor ordinary people are scattered and unorganized, and have needs but no way to express them. Therefore, in the initial stage, it is inevitable that the poor masses who need relief more will not receive relief. The general office had no choice but to narrow the target of the so-called "poor people" to the following five categories: (1) Refugees who have just been sent back to their hometowns (young and strong people who return to their hometowns will receive direct relief for one month), (2) Poor widows and orphans, (3) Poor and helpless children under the age of sixteen, (4) Poor and helpless people over the age of sixty, (5) Poor and disabled people. These five points are the standards set by the NRRA for direct relief targets. It draws the bottom line of poverty. Those below this level are people who cannot survive without relief. It is said that it is difficult to open the door to charity, and the more you help, the more people need help. In fact, before there was a relief method, the number of people who needed relief was no less than it is now. It's just that there wasn't a standard to distinguish them from the general public. Therefore, we are always ignorant and don't know how poor our country's people are. This standard tells us that there are many people who are breathing their last breath below the level of survival.</p>
<p>The reasons for the poverty of these people are international, political, and social, not the initiative of any individual. Therefore, the responsibility for curing their poverty lies on the shoulders of the United Nations and the government. However, when the UNRRA's supplies stop, it will be the end of the NRRA's days. However, the needs of the people below this level still exist, and the government's responsibility to them is unavoidable. We deeply understand that foreign aid cannot be relied on for long. It is time for the government to make huge annual budgets to plan welfare for the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>The second major problem in doing direct relief work is how to find and recognize the set targets. There are two methods, one is active and the other is passive. The former is to organize work teams. Each branch office organizes several work teams according to the severity of the disaster in its jurisdiction and the nature of the area, divided into three types: stationed, fixed, and mobile. This is the most common method used by branch offices. There are currently 269 emergency relief work teams, with the Hunan branch office having the most, with 154 teams. The remaining branch offices have between 4 and 25 teams. The work teams distribute supplies directly to the refugees in principle, but because China is vast and populous, the NRRA must cooperate with the original local authorities. One is to save manpower and financial resources for the NRRA, and the other is to strengthen local permanent agencies. Therefore, local public and private social service organizations and autonomous institutions are often invited to participate in the work or invited to organize local relief associations. All procedures for application, registration, and review are mostly handled by local institutions because local people are familiar with local conditions. The distribution of supplies is still the responsibility of the work team. It cannot be said that the NRRA did not take great pains in this method.</p>
<p>In this active method, there is another distribution method that we are all interested in, that is, in some villages, the work team asks the villagers to send representatives to a meeting to vote for the names of those who need relief the most. Then, the work team distributes supplies to those who receive the most votes according to the amount of existing supplies. This method is the fairest, fastest, and most direct.</p>
<p>The passive method is to divide the city into districts, and set up individual relief application stations in each district, using the local social affairs bureau or office as a central registration station to avoid duplication through connections. Because the area is vast and there is a lack of talent, it is inevitable that there will be omissions in the investigation of those who need relief, or that the period for distributing supplies has passed and they cannot receive relief. Therefore, individual relief stations are set up for people to apply directly to the station without submitting documents or entering government offices. Branch offices in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Guangdong, and Hebei have all used this method to provide individual living allowances or loans to purchase agricultural tools for self-reliance. The Nanjing office cooperates with institutions such as the Social Service Office and the Social Service Department of the Central Hospital to set up five stations in different districts, and also mobilizes students from Jinling Women's University and the University of Nanking who are taking social case work courses to participate in the investigation work at each station. This can be said to be the first time that Chinese government agencies have adopted the method of case work.</p>
<p>(The conclusion will be continued tomorrow)</p>
<p>Tangshan Builds a Moat Around the City: 8 Kilometers Long, 4 Meters Deep</p>
<p>Tangshan is an important town in eastern Hebei, with many factories and the center of the Beining Railway. Since the victory, the Communist army has repeatedly planned to attack. Recently, the eastern Hebei pacification zone, in order to seek a permanent solution to Tangshan's security, in addition to establishing a city defense headquarters to closely monitor the activities of the Communist army, it is also planning to dig a moat around the city so that the Communist army cannot launch a surprise attack. After active discussions by all parties, this plan was implemented on the 15th of this month. It is expected that the moat will be 8 kilometers long, 8 meters wide, and 4 meters deep, with water introduced into the river to a depth of 2 meters. The first batch requires 150,000 workers, mobilizing people from all levels of the city, including public officials, teachers, students, citizens, workers, and police, who take turns working every day until the entire project is completed. On the first day of construction, the reporter rushed to the construction site to inspect. All military and political leaders of Tangshan personally directed the work. By noon, a section of the foundation with a length of 600 meters and a depth of 2 feet had been dug. There were more than 5,000 workers on that day. According to the person in charge who told the reporter: This project will take about two months to complete, and from then on, Tangshan's security will be safe and sound.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Lacks Culture: The Book and Newspaper Industry is Declining</h3>
<p>— Fuzhou News on the 12th, Special Reporter Chen Zhengyu of this newspaper</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, due to the impact of the gold rush, the Fuzhou market was very chaotic, and all prices soared in a whirlwind. The rise in the cost of living, coupled with the increase in foreign exchange, caused the price of newsprint to rise to 200,000 yuan at its highest point. Although it has fallen slightly now, it still requires 140,000 to 150,000 yuan. In addition, labor costs are also trending upwards, and the Fuzhou book and newspaper industry is facing an unprecedented crisis.</p>
<p>There are currently six daily newspapers and one evening newspaper in Fuzhou. In the past, about two broadsheets were published daily by the Central Daily News and the Fujian Times, one broadsheet was published daily by the Southern Daily, the Justice News, and the Democratic News, and one quarto sheet was published daily by the Cui News and the Minhai Evening News. After the consolidation, the Central Daily News and the Fujian Times publish about a broadsheet a day, and the rest can only maintain one sheet. The largest circulation is the Central Daily News, which sells five to six thousand copies a day, and the rest sell two to two thousand copies or one thousand copies. Various newspapers from Beijing and Shanghai have sales in Fuzhou, such as the Nanjing Central Daily News, the Shanghai Shen Xin, Dagong, Southeast, and Wenhui. Among them, Shen Xin, Dagong, and Southeast have more readers. Many local people in Fuzhou are old readers of this newspaper for more than ten years, and they have a deep impression and good criticism of this newspaper.</p>
<p>There are a total of thirteen bookstores in Fuzhou. In addition to a few such as Commercial Press and World Bookstore selling textbooks, most of them sell Shanghai edition books and periodicals. In this year, people who want to read have no money to buy books, and people who have money simply don't think about buying books. Therefore, there are many people reading books in bookstores, but few people buying books. Every bookstore relies on dragging accounts to get by. Large-scale bookstores like "Zhizhi" and the longer-established "Lida" bookstore only have a daily business income of two to three hundred thousand yuan. Lengthy and massive books are priced too high and no one cares about them. Only magazines sell a little, and the ones with good sales are "Digest," "World Knowledge," and "Zephyr." In addition, the magazine "Home" also sells well, probably because everyone always uses "Home" to warm themselves.</p>
<p>When it comes to the publishing industry, we can't help but feel that Fuzhou lacks culture. During the war, the "Improvement Publishing House," "Lida Bookstore," and "Joint Compilation Store" located in Yong'an were the hubs of Southeast culture. These publishing institutions did indeed gather a lot of talent and produced some high-quality literary works, which made immortal achievements for the culture of the Southeast Theater. Now, talents have scattered, high prices have stifled the publishing industry, and most magazines have ceased publication. The only ones that exist, such as Fujian Agriculture published by the Provincial Research Institute and Fujian Education published by the Provincial Department of Education, are mostly general discussions. Fuzhou can hardly talk about publishing!</p>

<h3>I Live in Tang Bohu's Former Residence</h3>
<p>— Xiang Peiliang</p>
<p>"Heartless as a swallow or a goose, chasing after the fallen reeds on the west bank of Taihu Lake. A few desolate peaks, discussing the twilight rain. By the Fourth Bridge, I want to live with Tian Sui. Where are they now! Leaning on the railing to remember the past, the willows dance gracefully." (Dian Jiang Chun, Two Songs by Jiang Baishi).</p>
<p>Although Jiang Baishi was in the Southern Song Dynasty, it was still a good era. He could look at the lake and clouds from afar, watch the swallows and geese, savor the desolate dusk, and long for the former residence of the ancient poet Lu Guimeng, still vaguely present in the graceful willow branches. It seems that there would be no children's cries, the shock of beating tin foil, or the lonely cries of peddlers to disturb his mind.</p>
<p>I now live in Tang Bohu's former residence, a dilapidated old temple, the Zhunti Nunnery in Taohuawu, Suzhou. I have more than a dozen neighbors, almost all of whom are Shaoxing people who beat tin foil. Although I can't quite figure out their surnames, I have a very good friendship with them. This world is not as good as ideal, but it is not as bad as propaganda.</p>
<p>This is a house with more than 400 years of history. The earliest year is 1505, the year before Columbus died, the eighteenth year of Hongzhi of Emperor Xiaozong of the Ming Dynasty. There is a stele of Tang Bohu. The construction of the house must have been earlier. The original scene is impossible to imagine. The monks told me that the address of the nunnery was very large in the past, facing the river in the front and the Pagoda Shadow Pond (now blocked) and the Double Lotus Pond (this place name still exists today) in the back, covering an area more than ten times larger than today. Peach trees were planted extensively in the past, so it was called Taohuawu (Peach Blossom Dock). However, among the trees, peach blossoms have the shortest lifespan. Before it turned into mulberry fields, it had already disappeared. It has now become several rather desolate streets.</p>
<p>After Tang Bohu's death, he donated his house to become a temple, which has been passed down without interruption. Three Ming Dynasty sages are enshrined in it. The earliest was Jin Wang, with the courtesy name Zishang, who served as the prefect of Suzhou in the early Ming Dynasty. Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty was still angry because the people of Suzhou stubbornly defended Zhang Shicheng, and imposed very heavy taxes. Jin Wang requested tax reduction, which angered him and he was killed. By the time of Emperor Xuanzong, the prefect Kuang Zhou requested a tax reduction, which was approved. Later generations missed Jin Wang and built a shrine for him. There is a stele inscription by Yang Xiangzhen from the eighth year of Tongzhi, but that text does not explain from what time Jin Prefect was enshrined in the house in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The latest one was Yang Tingshu, with the courtesy name Weidou, from the Fushe Society at the end of the Ming Dynasty, who died in martyrdom when the country was destroyed. There is an existing carved stone portrait of Lord Yang Zhongjie (Zhongjie was a posthumous title given by friends), with an image eulogy by Wang Yu: "Weinan has the Big Dipper, giving birth to a great man. Reading the books of sages and becoming a loyal minister of the Ming Dynasty, he first braved the disaster of the eunuchs. He helped the capital, and his name was high in the Fushe Society. His lofty integrity is the most rigorous in virtue. He is a model for scholars in the southeast and a model of Confucianism. His position is humble but his virtue is revealed, and his Tao is consistent. He is like Lin Zong of the Han Dynasty and Yuan Yan of the Jin Dynasty. When the Central Plains was torn apart, he generously supported himself. He asked for the task and worked on the plan. Soon after the land fell into ruins, he was quickly overthrown. He killed himself to achieve benevolence, calmly and unhurriedly. Xiang Xian Boqi followed in the footsteps of Wen Tianxiang, shining through the ages, and his aura filled the two realms. Ji Shao's clothes were red, and Chang Hong's blood was green. We look at the posthumous portrait together and pass it on without end." The image eulogy was written in the fifty-second year of Kangxi, which is also more than 200 years ago. After the large former residence of Tang Bohu was converted into a temple, some local gentry also attached themselves to it, so there are relics of Lord Jin and Lord Yang.</p>
<p>Tang Bohu's true work is a grinding stone, engraved with his own long poem. The original stele is still there, but it is mostly blurred and not very readable. There is another stele recarved during the Daoguang period, and the writing and size are all modeled after the original stele. The poem "Maple Bridge Night Mooring" by Zhang Ji written by Wen Zhengming that I saw at Hanshan Temple is also mostly blurred, with only a few characters intact. The stele inscribed by Qianlong at Dengwei Xiangxuehai has no characters at all. Although the climate is humid and the stele is easy to peel off, no one preserves the historical sites in the cultural land of the southeast, and everything is allowed to wear away naturally in the endless wind and rain. The long poem is as follows:</p>
<p>"Taohuawu, the Peach Blossom Nunnery, in the Peach Blossom Nunnery lives a peach blossom immortal, the peach blossom immortal plants peach trees, and plucks branches to exchange for wine money. When I wake up from the wine, I just sit in front of the flowers, and when I am drunk, I still sleep under the flowers. Day after day in front of and behind the flowers, year after year drunk and sober. I am unwilling to bow to carriages and horses, but I wish to die old among flowers and wine. Carriages and horses are for those who toil, and wine cups and flower branches are for the poor. If you compare wealth and nobility to poverty, one is on the ground and the other is in the sky; if you compare poverty to carriages and horses, they can gallop and I can be free. The world laughs at me for being too crazy, and I laugh at the world for not seeing through it. Remember that there is no wine or flowers on the graves of heroes like Wang Ling, and they are plowed into fields." At the end is written "Sixth Day of the Third Month of Hongzhi Yichou, written by Rujiushi".</p>
<p>During the Qianlong period, the nunnery was abandoned and became the forest garden of the powerful. Shen Jiyou visited this place and discovered Tang Bohu's tomb (a few dozen steps northeast of the current nunnery, in a place called Tang Yin's tomb, but the site of the burial cannot be found). He told Song Shouzhong about it, and Song donated money to repair the tomb. Shen Jiyou wrote four seven-character quatrains, and the stone carvings are still there.</p>
<p>(1) "The desolate path and mossy stele are two hundred years old, and I accidentally talked about the desolate grave mound. The Zhongcheng is a romantic master, and he takes pity on the little robbery immortal of peach blossoms."</p>
<p>(2) "Revisiting has built a few thatched huts, and the fine water embankment is divided like a swallow's tail. It is good to bury the bones in a dock of red fragrance, and many spring outings go to the tomb of the top scholar."</p>
<p>(3) "Ashamed to be a mediocre official, Tang Liu's remaining ink is more precious than pearls. How can his family lack a tall tomb? The fragrance kills the talented jade ball."</p>
<p>(4) "I should know that I am also drifting, and the fairy grass is sad as if it has a soul! Buy all the scarlet wine of Wu girls, and pour it to you in the nether world."</p>
<p>A former residence with 400 years of history. There are virtuous magistrates who died in their duties, famous scholars who despised wealth, and scholars who refused to submit to foreign races and closed their eyes forever. These are all the most precious legacies of our culture. Their relics include Tang Jushi's handwriting and Yang Zhongjie's portrait. Now they are all scattered in the old temple that is gradually collapsing and have become a place for the army to raise horses. As for me, after nine years of running around, I have finally settled down. As long as I don't have to hide from air raid alarms every day and don't have to carry my children to cross 5,000-meter high mountains, I am satisfied with everything and don't bother to ask where I will be next year. I rarely have time to imagine Tang Jieyuan's romantic life, so I can't write good lines for this place. Perhaps there are still good-natured "romantic masters" like Song Muzhong in this era, but I have no way to meet them and cannot ask them to relieve the small disaster for the sages hundreds of years ago. Late at night, I have not fallen asleep, listening to the shocking sound of the tin foil-beating women who refuse to rest, and I feel a little nostalgic. I dare not despise wealth like Liu Rushi, but I dare not forget the spirit of Lord Yang Zhongjie who refused to seek wealth in any way. I envy the good times of the past, but I still resolutely live on in this era.</p>
<p>Behind the house, in a small gap, there is a small peach tree, which should be the remaining species after thousands of robberies. It is almost full spring, and it is about to bloom. At that time, I want to pick a branch and put it on my desk, accompanied by a few strands of willow, and reread the sentences of Baishi Daoren.</p>
<h3>Yan Liu Ci Hua (Discussions on Lyrics with Swallows and Willows)</h3>
<p>— Along</p>
<p>Wei Zhuang, with the courtesy name Duanji, was from Duling. He was once sent to Shu by Emperor Zhaozong. The lord of Shu, Wang Jian, seized his beloved concubine. Zhuang was filled with emotion and wrote a song called "Lotus Leaf Cup." "I remember that year under the flowers, late at night, when I first met Miss Xie, on the west side of the water hall, holding hands in secret. Regretting the remaining moon and dawn warblers, parting, and from then on, we are separated. Now we are all strangers in different places, and there is no way to meet again." Later, this poem was seen by the concubine, who stopped eating and died.</p>
<h3>Introduction to "Mountain Living Sketches"</h3>
<p>— Wang Jinshan</p>
<p>Since entering Sichuan in the summer of the twenty-seventh year, until the end of this year (the thirty-fourth year), I have always lived in the mountains. "The waters of the Shu River are green, and the mountains of Shu are blue." Watching the flowing clouds and listening to the flowing water, it has been six or seven years. Over these years, I have not been willing to be lonely, and I have done some dreaming in bits and pieces. When the mood came, I scribbled and wrote some things.</p>
<p>It is said that since ancient times, articles have been divided into those that express aspirations and those that carry the Tao, and there is also the saying of "great words are flaming, small words are verbose." Thinking about what I have written, it is certainly insufficient to carry the Tao, and it may not be true to express aspirations; great words and small words are also beyond my reach. Although what I say is what I want to say, and what I write is what I want to write; I have not only not measured the merits and demerits, but also rarely calculated the remuneration; some have been taken by friends to publish, and some have been locked in a drawer. Now I have taken them all out, selected twenty articles, and looked at them again. I only feel that although what I have written cannot be said to be uniquely expressing my spirituality, it is still attached to life; although it cannot be said to be unconventional, it still records the feelings of a small life in a great era. Therefore, I say that my writing is just like the tail of a composition topic, only "slightly expressing my feelings."</p>
<p>Because I often live in the mountains and fields, in mountain villages, I see the mountains when I open the door, and I am still in the mountains when I close the door, so I named it "Mountain Living Sketches." Although I know that the word "sketch" has long been in decline, fortunately this is only to leave a little trace for some dreams that have disappeared and are about to disappear; I do not consider myself humorous, nor do I boast of my spirituality; and most of them are attached to reality and are related to the War of Resistance, so they should not be said to be "not divorced from the evil habits of Ming Dynasty sketches" as the Summary of the Four Libraries says.</p>

<h3>Window</h3>
<p>— Zang Zan</p>
<p>There is a song, I remember it starts like this: "Quickly open your blue eyes, it is already dawn; you hear the birds singing in the forest, the song of love: you see the beautiful dawn light, the rose-colored sky..."</p>
<p>The world is originally beautiful, not only roses and love, but there are too many people who don't open their eyes; not only those who are sleeping. Not only those who are closing their eyes, not only those who are closing their ears and mouths, but also those whose hearts are deeply locked, I don't know how many.</p>
<p>Some are locked by others, and some lock themselves.</p>
<p>Of the ten silent people, nine are filled with resentment and explosives, unwilling to be silent. They want to cry, want to laugh, want to tear everything apart, but the experienced wall stands in front of them - only silence.</p>
<p>Silence is like a bottomless sea.</p>
<p>(People traveling in the sea should smell the strong breath of people. This is really an unbreathable air.)</p>
<p>I remembered the small earthen houses in the countryside of mountain cities: thick mud walls, low and repulsive roofs, no windows, only one door, especially in the hot and humid summers. When a person lives in the house, he can only live a moldy life with snakes and rats.</p>
<p>I also think of the large courtyards in some ancient cities. Although the houses are built beautifully, they are still surrounded by suffocating high walls, and there are two large stone lions sitting at the door. Living in these high walls, I dare not say that they are people. Their lives are the same as snakes and mice. If they are people, they are just people whose hearts are surrounded by thicker earthen walls.</p>
<p>There is no love between people, only prevention; no sincerity, only deception. The exchange of love and sincerity is blocked by walls of all sizes. Only in ideals does this world exist. No wonder those who say: "If one day everyone lives the life of Jing Yu Shi, this world will be transformed into heaven in an instant" are called dreamers, and are called people who are far from reality.</p>
<p>However, there are indeed people in this world who believe in heaven, and believe that it already exists in this world. They not only believe in it themselves, but also call on others to believe:</p>
<p>"I firmly believe that there is an ideal surrounding the earth, omnipresent, an ideal of heaven, which is not only produced from fantasy, but also produced from the ultimate reality in which everything dwells and in which everything moves. I believe that this illusion of heaven is already in the sunlight, in the green earth, in the beauty of human faces, in the wealth of human love..."</p>
<p>A heaven cannot be built by one person. Silent friends who believe in heaven! Open your window again, open a window in your strong earthen wall, outside the window is sunlight, is the green and wide earth, outside the window are the beautiful faces of human beings, and the abundance of human love overflowing...</p>
<p>Open your wall, one window, two windows, to see more broadly.</p>
<p>Push away that wall, you come out of the wall.</p>
<h3>Sandbag</h3>
<p>— Wang Rui</p>
<p>I received a telegram from my brother, De Yi, informing me that Dr. Chen Hengyi, the orthopedic expert who had treated my leg injury in Chongqing in 1927, was practicing medicine at a pharmacy in Shanghai. I told this to Ci. Knowing that my leg could undergo surgery even after several years of being able to walk, she went to see Dr. Chen on her own without a word. According to her, Dr. Chen didn't recognize my name and had no recollection of my injury at the time, but he earnestly advised Ci that it would be best if I personally went to him for an examination.</p>
<p>One cold afternoon, I accompanied Ci to a pharmacy on a certain road. Dr. Chen, whom I hadn't seen in seven years, still had the same rosy complexion, full of energy, and kind smile as he did seven years ago, making him seem approachable. He asked me about the detailed circumstances of my retreat from the front line and my injury, saying that it was very likely that a false joint could be made for the malleolus when the bone quality was stronger. He also mentioned that knee joint surgery could now be performed to improve flexibility, but the outcome might not be better than the current situation. A more appropriate method would be to straighten the leg, let the knee joint hang over the edge of the bed, and place a sandbag on the instep of the foot to apply pressure and allow the lower leg to droop. With this therapy, the injured person should lie flat in bed reading books and newspapers, so that the knee joint will gradually bend unconsciously.</p>
<p>Nowadays, seeing a doctor is like the gold bar era. Although Dr. Chen had the demeanor of a scholar, Ci still prepared some money for unforeseen expenses in treating the leg injury. Now, with Dr. Chen's instructions, a sandbag seemed easy to obtain, which delighted Ci! After taking the elevator down from the pharmacy, in the biting cold wind, I suggested that we immediately go to a bank that was building dormitories on the Bund to get sand and mud, and buy an evening newspaper on the way to use as a wrapper for the sand.</p>
<p>During my student days on the sports field, I had a relationship with sand and mud. When we were playing and sweating profusely, it would mischievously hide between our toes, following us to the dormitory and classroom. But I probably only gained a genuine sense of connection with sand and mud from today onward. Concentrating and observing carefully, shells and gravel were mixed and mottled, exposed to the sun, and flashing with a bright golden light in the wetness. The pity was that there was a little too much moisture, which would soon soak through the newspaper and create a risk of tearing. So we had to go to the Heng's residence, near the bank, to borrow a sandbag.</p>
<p>Ci handed me the black velvet hot water bottle and held the heavy sandbag herself, climbing the eighty-one steps to the Heng's residence. Panting, she smiled and asked her brother and sister-in-law to guess what she had brought. They were making jujube cakes, preparing for the New Year. Outside the misty glass window, dampened with steam, the bare branches of paulownia trees could be seen trembling in the cold wind, and faint sounds of New Year's gongs and drums could be heard from afar. The children thought we were bringing New Year's gifts. Only when they learned it was a bag of sand to bend my knee joint did the initial mystery dissolve in everyone's smiles.</p>
<p>After eating the hot jujube cakes and borrowing a cloth bag, we bid farewell to Ci's brother and sister-in-law and went downstairs. I still carried the black velvet hot water bottle, while Ci held the sandbag in her arms like a young mother holding a newborn baby, hopping and skipping, and said to me in a gentle and delicate voice, "There is hope in here."</p>
<p>I kissed her, saying, "There's a little treasure in here!"</p>
<p>What I meant was that it would be good if the knee joint could bend with the help of the sandbag; and if we had a baby with a face shining with golden light soon, that little treasure would certainly be happier than any contemporary scholar, both spiritually and physically.</p>
<h3>On Poetry</h3>
<p>— Renjie</p>
<p>The development of poetry is originally the development of human society as a whole; the changes in poetry should follow the rotation of the giant wheel of the times in the same direction. Then, let the poet only worship two gods of faith, which are "freedom" and "seeking truth," and through the results of labor and cultivation, make poetry the most robust and simple flower grown in the soil of reality, and lay the foundation for our future glory.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 204</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>At this moment, we only heard Tsurumi say "Very good," and then there was no sound. In less than half a second, Tsurumi was asking for a phone number again. The number he wanted was precisely our phone number. This revealed that Tsurumi wanted to make a phone call to solicit Mr. W's opinion on the "attack." As soon as Mr. W heard the number that Tsurumi was reporting, he immediately turned off the microphone and reached for the phone, waiting for the phone to ring.</p>
<p>We already knew why Tsurumi wanted to make a phone call and we could guess what he wanted to say; so we were now only paying attention to Mr. W's answer: whether he would insist on the established plan to carry out the attack, or listen to Tsurumi and Pingzi's advice, "Leave behind useful blood... prepare for a counteroffensive..."</p>
<p>"That's right..." Mr. W answered Tsurumi's call like this; "The issue of the attack has already been decided to be canceled. I am very grateful for the advice of you and your friend, Miss Pingzi... Yes... You are too kind... Yes... Okay, we'll talk again later..."</p>
<p>Mr. W put down the phone and smiled at us. It was somewhat comical that we were now listening to Tsurumi's conversation on the microphone and also receiving Tsurumi's phone call. Only Mr. W suddenly stopped smiling and pondered slightly, as if he were trying to solve a difficult problem. After thinking for a while, it seemed that he had found the answer, and he opened the microphone in the drawer again. I thought he must have wanted to hear what else Pingzi had to say about this organization since Tsurumi had already told Pingzi about our situation. As soon as the microphone was turned on, Yaoqun quickly moved her chair closer to me, indicating that she wanted me to continue the translation work:</p>
<p>Ping, ...lives in the Six Nations Hotel. But even if the incident just now hadn't happened tonight, I would have had to find your brother.</p>
<p>Tsurumi—Why?</p>
<p>Ping—Because of the urgent time.</p>
<p>Tsurumi—What time is so urgent?</p>
<p>Ping—We have to leave immediately!</p>
<p>Tsurumi—"We?"... What for? Where to?</p>
<p>Ping—To Shanghai!... Sigh, Brother, you must have forgotten what I told you!</p>
<p>Tsurumi—Tell me? I don't remember you telling me anything.</p>
<p>Pingzi didn't continue. We were listening very intently, knowing that what Pingzi had told him must be the secret of "Eight." But Tsurumi was being difficult; perhaps he was afraid that Pingzi would deliberately hold back the content of this secret, thereby controlling Tsurumi, so Tsurumi also deliberately acted coldly, pretending not to remember Pingzi's words, and not taking her "admonition" seriously. This was a reverse tactic, not just ordinary mischief. Pingzi didn't speak, probably angry at Tsurumi's cold words. Sure enough, Tsurumi spoke again:</p>
<p>"Alright, alright, Miss Pingzi, it's not something to be sad about!... Consider it my fault. Since I came here, I've met many new and old friends, and I haven't had enough time for social engagements. I also wanted to rest for a couple of days, but unexpectedly, many problems have arisen..."</p>
<p>Ping—I know my brother has a lot of friends, at least one very respected "lady friend." How could you remember my words? (Her voice was very low, probably still in tears, and her voice was not as sweet and crisp as before. I didn't pay attention to the words "lady friend," and translated them verbatim. I regretted it in my heart, thinking that I shouldn't have told this to Yaoqun, for fear of making her angry. But upon closer inspection of Yaoqun's expression, apart from a chuckle, there was no change. The innocence and candor of the Northeastern ladies are truly admirable.)</p>

<h3>The Threat of Gold</h3>
<p>— Li You</p>
<p>Reading "Gulliver's Travels," after the lands of the giants and the midgets, there are two more fantastical places. One of them is inhabited by creatures that are part horse and part human. These creatures are most fond of a special kind of stone found on the ground, which they regard as treasure. Those who obtain the "stone" hide it as if they were afraid of losing it, while those who don't have it try every means to steal and rob it. Many disputes in this country arise from this.</p>
<p>Looking at social news lately, I often think of the story above, and can't help but admire Swift's satirizing ability.</p>
<p>Take the news of the past few days, for example. The biggest and longest-running story is the case of the hidden gold on Fuxing Island, followed by the legend of gold bars carried on the crashed plane in Tianmen (the investigation result is hard to believe). In the past day or two, there has been the strange story of Zhou Gengsheng, a suspected traitor, dying of illness in prison and leaving a family letter saying that bail required thirty gold bars. These cases are often difficult to get to the bottom of in the short term, so readers often review them in the newspapers, giving some people endless interest and others a serious threat.</p>
<p>"People die for wealth, birds die for food." Logically, a person who doesn't covet wealth like life should be able to feel a little more at ease about this. But in fact, it is not. Before the trading of gold was banned, one day, while waiting for a tram, I stood in front of a small silver shop. It was already dusk, the twilight was like smoke, and pedestrians on the road were coming and going, making it seem crowded and hurried. Inside the silver shop hung a powder board with the market price of pure gold written on it. Despite the hustle and bustle of these pedestrians, when they walked to the silver shop, they stopped and looked at the powder board. Some muttered to themselves, some left silently, and there were other various expressions. In short, it is difficult to describe, but one thing is undoubtedly certain: the numbers on the powder board were closely related to them. They came and went hastily, and none of them were free from the control of these numbers. Anyone, even someone from Mars, would feel uneasy after seeing this scene.</p>
<p>Even though it has been banned, the threat of gold still exists in the shadows. There is a kind, well-behaved man who doesn't have gold and doesn't want gold. He has lived in a garret somewhere for ten years. Recently, the landlord received gold bars from someone else and asked all the residents, including that kind man, to move out. The kind man has always prided himself on not paying attention to gold, but now he also feels the whip of gold.</p>
<h3>Married Couples Should Have Friends of the Opposite Sex</h3>
<p>— Liu Meng</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Fang's "Love, Divorce, and Married Couples" in the "Free Talk" section of the 17th, I cannot help but disagree with Mr. Fang's insightful opinions. Mr. Fang's words are not without considerable merit, but after silently observing the facts, my conclusion is the six words "cannot be generalized."</p>
<p>Humans are always emotional creatures, and making friends, except for those with ulterior motives, is a manifestation of emotion. The so-called "friend" of course does not distinguish between genders. Pure concepts of friendship should not contain sexual relationships. This is indeed a platitude, but there is truth in it, and it is also the criterion for making friends.</p>
<p>I don't know if it's because I'm male or for some other reason, but I like to make female friends, but there has never been any estrangement or conflict between me and my newlywed wife. The reason is that my wife trusts me very much, believing that I will not overstep the boundaries, and I am indeed as she believes, only at the level of friendship. I correspond and talk with my female friends. Although we talk about everything and have passionate debates from time to time, the other party knows that I am a married man, and I always remember that I am a "husband." We respect each other's personality, and the friendship becomes even deeper.</p>
<p>Due to work reasons, my wife and I are separated by a distance of several hundred miles. Whenever I work late into the night, I am extremely tired and the work is not yet finished, letters from my wife and letters from my female friends can lift my spirits and allow me to continue working.</p>
<p>Can one make friends of the opposite sex after marriage?</p>
<p>My opinion is clearly different from Mr. Fang's, because based on my personal experience (I don't care if these two words are used appropriately or not), making friends of the opposite sex after marriage not only does not hinder the feelings between husband and wife, but can also make oneself and one's wife (or husband) feel the preciousness and warmth of friendship outside of marital love, thereby not feeling the monotony of one's life.</p>
<p>However, humans are emotional animals, and also jealous animals (whether male or female). Therefore, when making friends of the opposite sex after marriage, one must pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) There must first be mutual trust and understanding between husband and wife, and a step back for "empathy" must be left for each other.</p>
<p>(2) One must be honest with friends of the opposite sex, respecting oneself and others, and there must never be any intention to deceive.</p>
<p>(3) Do not associate indiscriminately: indiscriminate association will make your personality worthless.</p>
<p>These three points are also my motto for making female friends.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: On this issue, we have received a large number of submissions from authors, most of whom disagree with Mr. Fang's opinions. We are now publishing one of them here).</p>
<h3>"Spring's End, Dream Broken" to Begin Filming Soon, "China Enterprise"'s First Film</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The film industry's new army, "China Enterprise" company, has chosen the playwright Tang Shaohua's "Spring's End, Dream Broken" as its first film. The plot of the whole play is mournful and lingering, and extremely moving. The film will be directed by the famous director Ma Xuwibang, with the red star Liu Qiong as the male lead and the famous star Li Lihua playing the female lead. It is said that it has been decided to start filming on April 10th, and will be released during the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<h3>Remembering Hui Wenzheng's Love of Talent</h3>
<p>— Aiju</p>
<p>Wenzheng's staff was the most abundant source of talent, and the public often regretted missing out on talent. This is because those who join the staff cannot necessarily fulfill their potential. In Anqing, he lived in a large hall with my late father. In the middle three rooms, a long table was set up, and at dawn, the staff would gather and sit around the long table to discuss the matters to be handled that day, much like a meeting today. The other two rooms were a place for receiving colleagues and a dining room. The Duke resided in a room on the west side, and my late father resided in a room on the east side, specializing in memorials and all confidential documents. After lunch, the Duke would always take a short nap, and then play a game of chess. He was poor at chess but played quickly, making ten moves as fast as flying. Even if the opponent intentionally made concessions, he still lost most of the time. When he occasionally won, he would laugh loudly. He often quoted what Su Dongpo said: "Winning is certainly delightful, and losing is also pleasing" to console himself. After chess, he would definitely talk about literature and art, various notes on classics and history, and the "Thirty Poets Anthology" and the "Eighteen Poets Anthology" were all finalized at this time.</p>
<p>One day, he was granted a yellow mandarin jacket. At first, he was very happy when he received the imperial edict, but then he looked worried and said, "I am a farmer's son. My ancestors and father started their families by farming. Every time it rained and they went to the market, they only wore studded shoes. Today, let's write a poem clock about the yellow mandarin jacket and studded shoes to commemorate the favor and dare not forget our roots." Everyone in the room was stretching out paper and thinking, and Wenzheng was also holding a pen without writing, but Jin Meisheng, the Financial Commissioner, had already submitted his answer first. His poem said, "The Emperor bestows extraordinary colors, why should a man disgrace the muddy road?" This is a collection of idioms. The first couplet is naturally clever, and the second couplet is full of complaints. On the surface, it is still accurate. When the Duke read it, he praised it and said, "With this couplet, we can all put down our pens." On that day, the position of Shanghai Circuit Intendant was vacant, and it was decided to appoint him in the morning and recommend him to be appointed. When he went to take office, he especially warned him, "When we usually talk, I know that you are good at economics, and I have long thought of relying on your talent. However, I slightly dislike your impulsive temperament. Yesterday, your couplet was excellent, but your dissatisfaction was still too obvious, which is not the way to carry blessings. After you leave, you should focus on your work and be careful." Two years later, Jin was appointed as the Jiangsu Provincial Treasurer, but did not finish his term. Wenzheng can be said to have had foresight. However, although the Duke loved talent, he also had times when he made mistakes. My late father once talked about a matter concerning the Duke, saying, "There was a talented man on the staff who often discussed the great governors of various provinces, saying that so-and-so was authoritative, and people dared not deceive him; so-and-so was astute, and people could not deceive him; but only you, Duke, move people with virtue, and people cannot bear to deceive you." At that time, the Duke greatly approved of his argument, but who knew that he would later be entrusted with the likin administration and would end up losing hundreds of thousands of taels of gold. The Duke then beat his chest and exclaimed, "Cannot bear to deceive, cannot bear to deceive!" It can be seen that it is difficult to know a person, and a gentleman can be deceived by his way.</p>

<h3>Strange Tales of Plants</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>If you were to travel in a tropical forest, you would find that this forest is like a department store, with everything imaginable. When you get thirsty, there is a type of palm tree that grows a hidden trough at the base of its leaves. Cut open the end of the leaf, and a pint of clean water will be provided to quench your thirst. "Linas rattan," when cut open, will also flow out with water for bleaching. Another type called "Mother Tree Cow," when cut open, will flow out with a sweet and delicious juice, just like the milk you drink at home.</p>
<p>"Century grass" is the source of thread for local natives, and it even carries needles, with a barb growing at the tip of each thick leaf. After smashing this leaf, you will find that this needle is connected to many thin and tough strands of fiber. The red Indians of Central America use these strands of fiber to weave very strong cloths. The "hair-edged tree," called by the Spanish, is even more peculiar. Spreading out the pith of its branches reveals a beautifully structured white lace. Spanish women love to hear about this lace from the natives and use it as scarves or inlays on clothing.</p>
<p>When you want to cross a river, the bark of a purpleheart tree can be made into a boat, and its shape is like a rawhide raft. And the oar? Even more conveniently, there is a type called "oar tree," whose branches are flat, straight, and hard. Chopping one down gives you a natural oar.</p>
<p>Although you are in a remote forest, grooming still has to be done every day. There is a type of creeper that grows two sharp little leaves, which can be used to shave your face and trim your beard. "Soap rattan" can naturally be used as soap. Remove the leaflets from the stem of the "gru-gru palm" and you will have a new weaver's shuttle.</p>
<p>As for toys, the "kite tree" grows an oval leaf, two or three feet long and wide. Its leaf base is connected to extremely long and strong silk. Isn't that a kite string?</p>
<p>In terms of medicinal materials, in addition to the quinine tree that everyone knows, there are also "wild yam" and "ipecac," which are all treasures hidden in tropical forests. As long as you need them, they are inexhaustible.</p>
<p>There is also a type called "rape tree" in North Africa. Its nature is even more peculiar. Anyone who touches the "irritating part" of its branches will be captured by the tree with its roots and "raped" alive. The "mimosa" will shyly curl up its leaves when it sees your hand tempting it. The "daughterless grass" is an rootless parasite growing on tree trunks. The "insectivorous tree" uses poisonous mucus to hunt small insects. All of these will make you marvel at the wonders and magic of nature.</p>
<h3>Arts and Literature</h3>
<p>The Cultural Life Publishing House will be reprinting new books this week, including: "God, Ghost, Man" by Ba Jin, "Wu Zixu" by Feng Zhi, and three selections from the works of Turgenev: "Smoke," "A Nest of Gentlefolk," and "On the Eve."</p>
<p>Ba Jin's famous "Torrent Trilogy": "Family," "Spring," and "Autumn" have all been adapted into plays by famous playwrights Cao Yu, Lin Ke, and Li Jianwu, and published by the Cultural Life Publishing House.</p>
<p>Kunming's "Weeklies" are springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain, with many types, such as "Southwest Wind" and "Current Trend," among which "Social Weekly" is the most outstanding, and the "Friend Request Column" is especially unique.</p>
<p>Ma Zihua's "Yunnan Anecdotes" vividly describes the lives of the Yi people within the province and is well worth reading. (Yang)</p>
<p>The sixth issue of Volume 13 of "Family" has now been published, and the contents include the sections "Cosmic Points and Lines," "Essays and Notes," "Page of Cultivation," "Between Men and Women," "Love and Marriage," "Sayings and Deeds of Celebrities," "It Depends on Man," "Movies," and "Fiction." Each copy is sold for four thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Pioneering and Fleeing</h3>
<p>— Jue Ren</p>
<p>After years of clamoring to "go to the Northwest," unexpectedly, after "repatriation," everyone is still squeezing back to the Southeast. Originally, going to the Northwest was for pioneering, but in the end, the "wasteland" was not "pioneered," and all that was left was to "flee," as if it was "over and done with." (When he went to the Northwest and Southwest back then, he also fled.)</p>
<p>Logically speaking, the Southeast is densely populated, so there shouldn't be any wasteland. However, this is not the case. Not only is the countryside uncultivated, but even the wasteland in the cities is not pioneered. Has anyone seen Nanjing and Hangzhou, etc.? You will find many wastelands in remote areas. "Villages and towns are desolate, and the city faces the setting sun." One cannot help but chant the old tune of "Lament for Jiangnan."</p>
<p>Even if someone transports countless crops, fruits, cattle, and even farming machinery from other countries, they will either perish due to lack of support or exhaust themselves due to lack of assistance. Nature is so good, but human affairs are not managed well. We are clamoring about poverty every day, but there is no way to inspire production to flourish.</p>
<p>People are just crowding in the market, "bewitched by paper and drunk on gold," forgetting the local saying that "white jade grows in the soil, and gold comes out of the ground." A young man studying agriculture said to me, "The earth is lovely, the smell of the soil is fragrant, especially in this spring. But you are at a loss, and you cannot help but shed tears when you look at the vast wasteland."</p>
<p>These words are enough to sting the hearts of those who yearn for governance. But I remember a good story. In an ancient fable, an old man's last words to his sons were: "My sons, dig in this vineyard." They followed the old man's words and dug all over the vineyard. Although they did not find the hidden gold, they had plowed the vineyard all over, so the grapes were ripe that year, and they also became rich.</p>
<p>Just focus on plowing and cultivating. Don't dream of excavating the gold and silver treasures hidden by Zhang Xianzhong in front of the Wangjiang Tower in Jinjiang. You only need to dig through every corner of your own vineyard, and when the grapes are ripe, you will have a day of unexpected harvest.</p>
<p>It is a pity that too few of us have pioneering hands, and too many of us have opportunities to flee. Written in Hangzhou on Arbor Day, 1947.</p>
<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Xu Shaoming nodded, feeling this guess was quite reasonable.</p>
<p>"Then, do you want me to mediate for you again?"</p>
<p>"Good, inviting him for a chat is possible!"</p>
<p>"Don't underestimate Old Zhu's gang! Old Xu." Little Shen was, after all, smarter than them, and because of the Jin Aili affair, he further understood the stubbornness of that bunch of poor bastards.</p>
<p>"Anyway, what's the harm in talking to him?" Xu Fatty's only goal was to prevent the associate manager, who had already been used by him once, from losing heart, so that he could always be in cahoots with him. "Regarding the donation campaign they stirred up, I donated over four hundred thousand all by myself, purely for Old Zhu's sake; now, for these trivial matters, if we ask him for help, how could he be embarrassed to refuse?"</p>
<p>Little Shen gradually understood Xu Shaoming's intention.</p>
<p>"Actually, you don't even need to appease them, just let them scold you in the newspapers! Look, for more than a month, which newspaper hasn't been vehemently denouncing Yue Zhang, but until now, Yue Zhang is still the commander-in-chief of the Seventh Army! Your China Tea Company isn't without a background, is it?" Little Shen showed his eloquence, making Xu Fatty and Old Zhu very happy.</p>
<p>Xu Fatty was even more excited, reaching out to grab Little Shen's new Hawaiian shirt made of white toweling, urging him to sit down and drink.</p>
<p>Little Shen pretended to be reluctant before sitting down. Xu Shaoming hurriedly used chopsticks to tap the plate, calling for Ah Shi to bring the wine glasses.</p>
<p>"With a clear conscience! How much money can I, Zhu Xinong, actually get? It's nothing more than helping friends!" Associate Manager Zhu, with his red nose, squinted his narrow eyes, complaining to the other two.</p>
<p>"Of course, you, old brother, are a man of conscience!" Xu Fatty said with a smile, with some satirical meaning, but not too obvious, and he didn't laugh out loud.</p>
<p>Little Shen was also laughing inside, but it didn't show on his face.</p>
<p>"What have Old Zhu's gang been busy with these past few days? It's like they don't even want to flee!" he asked curiously.</p>
<p>Xu Fatty was chewing on a piece of abalone and didn't have time to answer.</p>
<p>"Seems like they're busy performing and comforting the troops again?" Old Zhu said uncertainly.</p>
<p>"Who says otherwise!" The abalone in Fatty's mouth was already swallowed. "They just love doing these kinds of attention-grabbing things! My second cousin-in-law gets along best with them. After arriving in Guilin, she isn't in a hurry for anything. These past few days, she's been going to the Art Museum almost every day, saying she's helping them paint scenery..."</p>
<p>Little Shen suddenly paid attention.</p>
<p>"Isn't that the one sitting outside in the courtyard enjoying the cool air?" He opened his eyes wide, asking with unusual excitement. (Two) (Three)</p>
