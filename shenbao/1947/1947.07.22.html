<h3>復興經濟五年計劃　主席批令採擇施行　經會修正通過改革方案</h3>
<p>〔本報甫京廿一日電〕我國復興經濟之戰後第一期五年計劃，業經草擬完成，依戰前價値估計需款二一，九三七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，動用人員四，九六八，〇九三名。該計劃已經蔣主席同意，批交全國經委會採擇施行。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕經濟改革方案業經廿一日全國經委會八次會修正通過，即送政院轉呈，俟國務會議核定，並擬具實施辦法，付諸實施。此各方重視之經濟改革方案，全文十五章，長五千餘言，先後經多次研討並經綜合審查，始於今日通過，其中政治部份咸已删去，不論就內容言，體裁首，均較原案週密多多。可謂全國經濟專家之心力結晶。方案共分三大部份：最先爲前言，略述當前經濟危急情况及在金融生產及財政三方面應加努力之點，對於復興農業，穩定物價及幣値尤爲注意。次爲方案本身，共分三部：甲，爲金融，共分銀行等十三項，乙，爲生產建設，包括：（一）農業，分四項，（二）工業，分十四項，（三）商業，五項，（四）交通，八項，（五）增產物資，穩定物價共八項。丙，財政，共分：（一）整理財政，下分九項，（二）穩定幣値。最後爲結論。會中今日討論該案時，最主要之修正，爲進出口聯鎖制，蓋當時曾有若干委員認數額以不規定爲佳，亦有委員謂須加規定者。最後決定，指定若干物資實行進出口聯鎖辦法。此外，征用國人在外存款。（三）原屬商業部門，現歸入穩定幣値項下。又會中對外人在華投資問題，曾加討論。各委員咸有寶貴意見提出，並推定若干委員予以審查。今日會議自下午三時開始至七時許始散。陳立夫主席，出席委員何浩若，施奎齡，兪鴻鈞，潘序倫，鄧飛黃，兪飛鵬，左舜生，王曉籟，棋桐孫，黃元彬，薛篤弼，劉健羣，陳啓天，翁文灝等。</p>
<p>方案前言內容</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕經濟改革方案前言對金融生產財政三者今後應加努力之點，闡述極詳，據稱：目前經濟危機，日趨嚴重，亟應探討　結所在，以爲改革。依據生產要素，即土地，資本與勞力，農村所缺者僅爲資本。此後金融機構本身如何健全與充實，其資金如何與土地勞力配合得宜，以達到農村繁榮，農民購買力提高，而奠定並發展國內輕工業之基礎。至各銀行之業務，均應有明確之分工，各有所專司，各有其使命，互爲發展經濟之一環。此爲金融上應亟求改革者。其次，如何使農業國趨向於工業化，實爲今後建國最主要之課題，今後如何運用國家資本，輔導私人資本之活用，以國營事業任其難，扶助民營事業任其易，並歡迎外國資本與技術人才，以達到工業化之目的，此爲生產建設上應求改革者。再次，財政應自發達各種生產之業着手，方可期收入之比例增加，如何開源節流，改善征收方針，使財政基礎隨各種生產事業之發展而增厚，以數萬萬元生產能力及其總收入支持整個國家之財政。</p>
<p>方案另一重要部門爲結論，指出金融政策·經濟政策·財政政策三者互爲因果，相濟相成，本方案所述，正由政府施行，尙未著效者，魔法布上主管部會加強實施，其正待實施者，應即分別擬具詳細計劃。應注意者有三：（一）合理解決官·兵·公務員·工等遇，使能維持最低必需之生活，俾行政效率得以提高。（二）國營事業與民營事業應立同等地位。（三）應在社會方面發動廣大之經濟建設運動，提高民間對經濟之了解與興趣。</p>
<h3>我貿易商應組　對日貿易公司　駐日代表團經濟副組長談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿一日電〕日本對外貿易恢復期日近，我駐日代表團經濟組副組長林司儀，籲請我國內貿易商，即時組織對日進口貿易公司。林氏强調稱：遠東委員會刻准許日本恢復對外貿易，而所較勵者，實爲私人貿易，而非政府貿易。渠繼稱：貿易代表四百人中，中國貿易代表將有六十四人。據林氏稱：對日和約簽訂前，日對外貿易，仍受盟總管制，貿易商前來日本，必須經盟總批准，外國貿易商，在日本可與日本貿易商直接接觸，惟任何商業合同必須經盟總批准，方可訂立。例如中國貿易商與日本貿易商同意訂立合同，中國貿易商應將此事陳報中國駐日代表團，轉送盟總批准。林氏稱：所有物價，均經盟總按照世界市塲價格，予以規定，所有交易，概以美元計算，轍出貨物，將分爲二類：一爲政府貿易，另一則爲私人貿易·生絲·棉織物·及茶·係屬諸政府貿易者，貨物可在當地提取，亦可在中國提取，前者中國貿易商，個人負責貨運，後者盟總及日本方面協助貨運。林氏繼稱：嗣後將訂有辦法，以使中國貿易商，使用中國船隻。記者詢以在日華僑，是否可從事中日間進出口貿易？林氏答稱：須經中國政府之批准。林氏繼解釋稱：欲來日貿易之中國貿易商，必須首向經濟部申請批准後，經濟部函請外交部　令中國駐日代表團向盟總申請該貿易商之出港單。林氏並宣佈，我國最近將派遺貿易代表團來日。（昨日本報第二版所載「立委蕭錚黃元彬談開放對日貿易」。按蕭錚爲全經會委員，並非立委，附此更正。）</p>
<h3>首批日賠償艦　一部即將裝備</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕據軍聞社訊：現在滬之首批日賠償艦八艘，內一部份即將裝備武器，開始服役。</p>
<h3>主席擬在奉化　競選國大代表</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿一日電〕立委及國大代表之選舉，政府決如期舉行，各地準備競選日烈。茲悉：蔣主席亦擬在其故鄉奉化，競選國大代表。該縣競選候補者因遞正希望甚大，故參與者多，計有兪飛鵬·劉祖漢，毛　卿等。傳蔣經國亦愿參與競選。該縣孫義慈則放棄區城選舉，參加自由職業新聞界國大代表競選。</p>
<h3>莫德惠談話　擬請款安插東北義軍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕府委莫德惠對記者表示：此次全爲義軍事來滬，廿三日擬返京。關於義軍返鄉後之安置，本人計劃向中央請款十億流通劵，作爲安插之經費。彼等回東北後，大部份將從事屯田，一部份進入工廠，老弱殘廢者予以救濟收容。終期多方設法，不使其流離失所，國家優待此批首先抗日之將士，對於未來抵禦外侮，自有裨益。東北目前已成世界之導火綫，其未來發展關係世界之安危，西北亦爲我國之邊境，與東北不能分別輕重。魏特邁將軍之使華，自可增强中美友誼，中國今日之局面，美·蘇共同退出由中國自決爲一途徑，由美國支持我國應付共產主義之擴張爲另一途徑，兩者之中，必居其一。詢以張學良在莫干山之說是否可靠，莫氏答謂：「張學良並未離開台灣」。</p>
<h3>張學良仍在台　近曾致函其弟張學銘</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一日電〕關係方面消息，張學良仍在合，已飛浙說不確，張最近曾致函其弟張學銘，謂東北失陷太久，向處理局索回舊產業大可不必，張學銘現任東北保安長官部主任高參，現因事來平，陳總長離平前，曾予召見。</p>

<h3>民衆武力造成　察綏晉北安寗　傅作義對本報記者談</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿一日電〕張垣綏署主任傳作義，廿一日上午接見本報記者，據談：目前察綏及晋北大致安寗。此種安寗乃賴民衆武力造成，例如周前距永寗八公里之某鄉，以使有廿餘支步搶之自衛隊，力敵六十倍之共匪一千二百人，達四小時以上，俟國軍趕至，終將該股共匪消滅。蓋民衆如得政府支援，必將盡心竭力，捍衛家鄉，共匪自無存身之地。察省今年麥收尚佳，軍糧民食差可無虞，至代糧部徵購事，以差價過大，察省以採購餘糧爲原則，不取攤買辦法，藉免中小農戶不公平之負担及不肖分子之中飽。察省之工商業，因遭共軍之摧殘破壞，恢復極難，然現較八九月前已大爲改善。傳氏對外蒙軍人侵綏事，謂：「毫無所聞」然亦未否認其可能性。關於邊疆防軍力量是否可於將來應付萬一一點，渠謂：就目前看，此點似無大要，至於將來，軍事變化極速，未便預測。傳氏健碩如恒，言談之間對內蒙諸省前途頗覺樂觀。據吿此行乃爲若干事務問題晉京接洽請示，不日即行返防。</p>

<h3>故都女子趙樹華　化名行騙被拘捕　捏造公司名義招考員工　大事登廣告濫收報名費</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿一電〕平市警備部十九日查獲一故示豪華，化名徐麗園之女子，以「孚中公司」名義，大招員工，騙取報名費案，雖騙款僅二百萬元，而受騙者達六百餘人。此女子原名趙樹華，三十歲，抗戰前畢業於貝滿女中，二十八九年曾爲軍統局在平作地下工作，二十九年春被日憲兵陷獄，拘押一年二個月，本夫于某，曾任貴州某師管區上校參謀處長，現在東北黑山縣原籍，抗戰期間分離，渠在平因生活無着，先後與七人發生同居關係，最近與張某同居，常賣一空，而本天于某來信，令其偕十二歲之女速返東北原籍，伊因路費無着，乃設計騙財，連續在各報大登啓事，揑造「孚中公司」招考各級員工，刊出較擬之報酬數字，迄被捕之日，尚有報名者絡繹前往，每名收費三千元。事發前，伊已在其居住之二間陋室考試一次，而被人發覺破綻，伊自稱爲「孚中公司」人事科長，遇投考者發生疑問時，伊即命其姘夫張某招待，而自稱赴某公司經理家接洽款項，乘預先備好之汽車，在外兜一圈子，以示闊綽，若有其事，並稱：此公司與聯勤總部有關，總公司在津，分公司設平西郊之海甸，以圖集得報名費至相當數目，背其姘夫潛返東北原籍。後被保甲長識破而被捕。初尚堅不吐實，後因所供漏洞百出，遂自書一長千牢之自白書，文理通順，一揮而就，大要稱：因欲返鄉與本夫相見，多方籌措路費不得，而藉招考職員爲名，騙取報名費，因車票購買困難，故未成行，自知所作皆在法律以外，個人所作應由自己承當云云。</p>
<h3>蘇州湘城鎭　囤糧案判決　王省初處刑半年</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿一日電〕縣屬湘城鎭立昌碾米廠，前經蘇縣府查獲囤積稻穀糙粳共約千餘石，當以該廠業務並非經營糧食買賣，僅屬代客春碾，而購囤大宗糧食，顯屬違反糧管條例，遂將囤糧查封，並拘獲經理王省初，移送吳地院法辦，茲已審理終結，於昨日由張錫永推事宣判，王省初處徒刑六月，依照刑法第四十一條之規定，易科罰金以一千元折算一日，所查封之糧食，除客商碾存數外，計購囤糙粳一百五十市石，及粳稻八十七担又九十市斤，均予沒收，按此案爲蘇糧商違反糧管處刑之第一案。</p>
<h3>社論　祝賀印度的新生</h3>
<p>公元一九四七年七月十八日上午十時四十分（格林威治標準時間），英國貴族院，即英國國會的上議院，正在舉行一個隆重的儀式：國王御前委員會正在那裏開會，司法大臣穿着禮服，戴着似頭髮在那裏主持這一會議，國會的司書用着十一世紀的諾爾曼法文，宣在着：『王上願意如此」。就在這個具有歷史意味的塲合下，英國會以極迅速的時間所通過的印度獨立案，得到了國王的批准而生效。從那時候起，英王喬治第六已不再是印度的皇帝。印度的新生，印度聯邦和巴基斯坦的誕生，就在那個時候昭吿於世。這眞是一個具有歷史意義的日子：大英帝國從那時起退出了印度。巴基斯坦和印度聯邦的正式誕生雖還要等到八月十五日，但在七月十八日這一天卻就注定這兩個新邦的命述。以一個地壤相接的隣邦，我們對於印度的新生，無不由衷地表示我們的祝賀。如今英國是要退出印度了，印度人民所要求的獨立自主，即將成爲事實；我們願今後的印度聯邦和巴基斯坦的國運昌隆，雖則嚴格地講，這兩個新生的國家，現在還沒有正式誕生。不過由於此一印度獨立法案的正式完成，七月十八日這一天無寗說是這兩個新邦的誕日。</p>
<p>上議院這一會議，結束了英國在印度的二百年統治。這二百年的歷史，無須我們在此再有所申述。此在世人，早有公論。尤其是從一八七七年英王后維多利亞加冕爲印度皇后以來，此七十年問，印度的局勢之能稍趨於安定，得以從事於交通　礦以及水利的諸種建設，我們不能不對英人治印的政績表示　仰。正如人不能全靠麵包過活一樣，英人在印的物質建設終不能抑制印度人民超物質的要求。印度人民的獨立運動就在這種情形下澎湃着。第一次世界大戰以後未能滿足的願望，到了世界第二次大戰以後實現了，我們於此自不得不向英國的執政首相艾德里表示無限的敬佩。這是由於他的卓識，印度纔在今天得到新生。大英帝國在印度的退出已成爲事實，不願淸理大英帝國的前首粗邱吉爾必然會感慨萬千，無怪在這次上院的築會就不見有這位老人的影子。</p>
<p>不錯，英國退出印度後的印度將不是統一的印度，而是兩個印度：印度聯邦和巴基斯坦。我們對於這兩個新邦的誕生並不感到希奇。印度是一個次於洲的大陸，自有史以來，在這一個亞大陸上始終就沒有政治上的統一。歷史上所著稱的孔雀王朝和其後的莫古兒帝國，在政治上沒有達成印度的統一，先孔雀王朝的維陀時代，就依史詩吉利達沙及沙恭遂拉等所記，印度文化亦僅限於一隅。統一的印度是一個理想，此次印度的新生，將印度分爲印度聯邦和巴基斯坦，可以說是實現印度統一的必經階段，必分而後始能有合。印回之間，感情的積不相容，由來以久；此次印回分治，可謂各得其所。我們不能不佩服英國對印政策的高明，但新生的巴基斯坦，它所可能遭遇到的種種，其困難怕十百倍於新生的印度聯邦。在經濟方面不用說，這將是工業印度聯邦農業巴基斯坦的局面。巴基期坦的工業化決不是短期內可以實現的；而印度聯邦却已有其工業的基礎·是近印度聯邦的國旗，廢棄了代表甘地主義的手搖紡織機，而代之以輪機，就可以看到印度聯邦是要向工業這一方面邁進的。然而巴基斯坦所處的地位却實在重要，越興都庫什山以北，就是蘇聯。它實處於東西兩世界的要衝：它不僅是印度聯邦的前衛，抑且變成了西方世界的前哨。英國在政治上是退出了印度了，但在道義上的責任，似乎一時也不容易推卸下來。</p>
<p>印度雖因此兩新邦的誕生而獲得了新生，然橫在印度前面的問題還很多。藩邦的地位，就是一個値得注視的問題。依據英政府方面的意向，印度各藩邦似須在印度聯邦及巴基斯坦兩者中「擇一而事」。印度國大黨又聲稱：不容許藩邦的獨立；而在藩邦方面却又有組織「拉基斯坦」的傳說。後者雖不盡可靠，英方也不致容許有此項運動的醞釀。然旣有此傳說，也頗値得注意。印度的藩邦爲數在二三百以上，其中在西北的喀什米爾，在中部的海特拉巴，及在南部的麥沙爾及屈拉凡哥尤爲著稱。喀什米爾的人口多數是伊斯蘭敎的信衆，它的改隸巴基斯坦問題較少。然而就是在喀什米爾，信奉印度敎的藩王是否願意參加巴基斯坦也是問題。印度藩邦地位的如何演化，實爲印度局勢此後的重要關鍵。此外，在印度，還有葡屬印度，還有法屬印度。如今印度旣遭遇新生，這些問題題必將有解決的一日。我們願新生的印度，能在目今這種動盪的國際形勢下好自爲之！</p>
<h3>印尼戰事的爆發</h3>
<p>印度尼西亞的戰事，如今正式爆發了！荷蘭軍隊，包括曾受美軍訓練之海蠶陸戰隊在內。已於昨日開始向印度尼西亞共和國發動攻勢，以閃電戰術占領共和政府各機關，並枸捕「叛逆」要人二百人，包括印度尼西亞共和國副總理珈尼及其它政府要員在內。同時爪哇及蘇門答臘各地，尤其是泗水，萬隆，巨港等處，戰事正在劇烈展開中。在動盪不安的世界局勢中，如今又有印尼戰事的爆發，誠令人不免扼腕太息！</p>
<p>本來自日本投降以來，印尼的局勢，一直就在武裝衝突的情形下，流血事件，時有發生。荷印副總督范穆克自身就是印尼土人，又得荷蘭政府的信任，是應該可以調和印尼及荷蘭雙方的觀點的；然而發動對印尼戰事的，下令用兵的，却就是這位出生在荷印有印尼血統的范穆克，這對范穆克是怎樣的一種諷刺！</p>
<p>此次印尼戰事的直接原因，由於印尼方面拒絕荷蘭得在印尼與共和政府聯合設置憲警的這一要求。此在印尼政府，我們認爲不能說毫無理由。因爲有此要求，於是引起人民不滿，終而因此而使荷蘭使用武力，企圖以軍力壓抑印尼人民的民族願望，此在荷蘭誠不免暴露出了帝國主義者的猙獰面目。我們認爲這不是明智的舉措。世人同情的誰屬，不用說，是很明顯的在那一方面。</p>
<p>然而値得我們注意的是：印尼方面對於他們的獨立運動，其問政治的鬥爭是頗爲劇烈的。印尼前總理薩希里於兩個月前因不堪「左翼政團」的脅迫，憤而辭職，印尼的政治因而爲急進份子所操縱，致使兩月來印尼與荷蘭間的談判，迄未能有順利的展開。如今戰事的爆發，無寗說是左翼急進份子抬頭的必然結果。正惟其如此，我們希望荷蘭政府能出以審愼忍默，務使戰鬥行爲在最短期內迅予結束，不再擴大，以恢復和平及安寗的秩序。現在的國際局勢是太動盪了，我們不容許再製造足以增加動盪的事件！</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿一日廣播：荷蘭權威方面表示，英美若出任調停，則戰事必可終止，但荷方事先必須獲得印尼接受荷蘭全部要求之保證。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿一日廣播：印尼共和國總統索卡諾廿一日夜發表廣播演說稱：荷蘭軍隊十二萬人，刻正由陸海空三路進攻印尼共和國。渠籲請世人促使聯合國安全理事會處理荷印之爭端。</p>

<p>又訊：印尼總統今向全國人民廣播，並籲請聯合國干涉荷印戰事。並謂：「深信正義在吾人之一方面，余請向聯合國提出此一問題，俾正義得以維護」。</p>
<p>又訊：荷蘭政府今日以備忘錄致達駐海牙之中英美等國領事，聲明現時荷方尙未能確定須進攻至何種程度，但深信不致波及印尼全境。又半官方表示：在機會到臨時，荷方決接受英方之調停。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴達維亞廿一日電〕印尼總理夏利福亭今日下午自日惹電台向國人廣播，囑全國人民奮起抵抗荷蘭侵略者。渠指荷方之「限制的戰術」，係表示荷方之進行殖民戰爭，使印尼再度陷入奴隷地位。夏氏稱印尼人當自山谷中迎戰荷軍。</p>

<p>〔中央社巴達維亞廿一日電〕荷印副總督范莫克雖曾宣佈軍事行動將盡可能使之限於局部，惟該事之經過，極可能迫使荷軍採取全面行動。印尼共和國是否將於最後時刻軟化，抑或作戰到底，刻尙難預言。惟根機事實判斷，印尼軍必將在若干地區，尤以遠離各海口及劃界綫之地方，展開大規模焦土活動。目前荷軍控制之區械，有巴達維亞，萬隆，泗水，巨港，三寶龍，棉鬧及把東等地。據估計爪哇與蘇門答臘，約有華僑一百萬人，大多留居於印尼控制地區內。今局勢旣惡化，今後華僑之處境，將決定於荷印雙方之行動。荷軍之軍事行動以及砲隊，海岸砲合，及空軍之砲火，自難免將使華僑遭受損失。至於印尼方面，華僑必將遭受縱火，刦掠，及勒索等不幸。爪哇與蘇門答臘之前哨各地，尤將臨此遭遇。</p>

<h3>杜魯門提出經濟報告書　闡述美援歐能力　凡能自助者美國必須續予援助</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿一日電〕杜魯門總統頃向國會提出上半年度經濟報吿審稱：美國在明年或不能維持本年所于歐洲之援助數　，就目前國內經濟情形而諭，雖增加努力及全國經濟響應政府之呼　與命令，但吾人已答應之援助範圍，恐仍將不能履行，故歐洲應先分配使用其所有之資源，然後再可計及美國根據馬歇爾經濟援助計劃所能提供之援助。</p>
<p>其次，美國剩餘物資今後恐亦不能再如過去六個月之供應外國，惟美國今仍應加緊努力，俾可援助歐洲，蓋此一政策具有長期性與永久性之利益故也。要知美國所費於經濟援助者，實僅及戰爭費用之一小部份，事實上此項援助尤爲獲致和平之必備條件。美國資源廣博，理應可以改進人民之生活水準及繼續出產供輸出之商品。政府所任命之三個特別委員會，負責研究美國援助國外一項問題，現正在編　洲需要品之目錄及佔計美國在能力範國所能供應之物資。美國援助外國應着重一項條件，即美國今準備討論援助歐洲經濟復興之問題，但需由各該國先提出其本身之計劃，始能取得此項援助。凡能自助者，美國必須繼續予以援助。今爲辦理此項援助外國之新計劃，亦需研究美國進行大規模出口貿易在經濟上所將引起之影響，若輸出計劃平衡，則生活水準已較戰前爲高之國家，當不致加劇其貧窮。此一計劃寶亦爲美國外交政策之中心。惟目前國內經濟情形尙需加以一一調整，例如貨幣準備金之積聚，即需防止某從事投機，提高薪金，則需不致引起生活程度之高漲，然後方可保障全體之生活水準。</p>
<h3>華萊士分析　美經濟趨勢</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿一日電〕前美國副總統華萊斯接見南斯拉夫官方通訊社坦友格社紐約特派員發表談話，表示相信馬歇爾計劃可以使美國之經濟不景氣延遲發生。渠並曰：若馬歇爾計劃將世界分裂爲二，或其首要目的在復活德國，以與蘇聯對抗，則渠反對此一計劃。華氏稱：美國生產業已達極高度水準，就業人數突破承平時期之記錄，去年之生活費用已增加三分之一，故至一九四八年可能將發生對高物價之普遍不滿，同時並可能發生進人經濟衰退之趨勢。但若馬歇爾之援助放款計劃經國會通過，則經濟不景氣可望延遲至一九五〇或一九五一年。</p>
<h3>美國肅淸共產份子以來　陸軍部已罷免八百餘人</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕陸軍部廿日宣佈佈：自參謀部肅淸共產份子工作開始以來，因不忠而被撤職之軍政人員已達八百餘名，此爲去年七月至本年四月爲止之撤職人數，而大戰開始後至去年七”爲止以同樣理由而遭撤職者，僅六十一人云。</p>
<h3>西方國家意見未能一致　美國正力謀挽救</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕美國外交政策負責人士一週前以東西兩方陷於破裂一事爲憂，今則已自今日起着手草擬馬歇爾計劃之方式，以防止西方國家本身趨於分裂。蓋法國已會表示復興德國一事倘不能滿足法國之安全要求，則法國不能與之推行馬歇爾計劃故也。按法國之要求，乃將萊茵區與德國分離，及魯爾區加以國際化等事。德國之將來工業潛力，實爲其主要難題，西歐對此，似已近於破裂之象。同時英外相貝文上週六在礦工野宴會中所發表之演說，似亦有轉變英國外交作風之象徵。</p>
<h3>法將竭盡所能　緩和美蘇對立</h3>
<p>法總理賴瑪迪稱</p>
<p>〔聯合社法國伯比南廿一日電〕法總理賴瑪迪今日在黨派會議時宣稱：法國將竭盡所能，使美蘇兩國不致互相對立，並概使　國復歸統一，以防東西分裂。蘇聯拒絕參加討論馬歇爾計劃之歐洲會議，不能認爲係最後決定。</p>
<h3>內部裂痕日顯　片山內閣動搖　社會黨仍堅持煤礦國營</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿一日電〕片山首相因國會定廿五日復會，特招待記者團，發表談話，略稱：在即將來臨之和約會議上，日本爲增高國際信用，希望造成舉國一致之政府，即決心强化與黨三派在閣內之團結，並進而希望在野黨中心勢力之自由黨予以誠意之援助。本屆國會之各種法案，其未能按時提出者，要能由於負責官吏之怠工，但調查之後，若果屬實，即擬取消夏委之半日工作制，而嚴厲監督之。</p>
<p>又有非難新物價之決定及經濟緊急對策等爲强迫動勞者忍苦之政策，惟現內閣並未忘其係以動勞者爲後盾之內閣，故希望非難者能予以理解而援助之。至於煤炭國家管理問題，乃社會黨對國人之公約，絕對望其實現。與黨三派間雖意見對立，但結果因在四黨政策之協定規定內，曾經決定，故相信此次可提出國會。若不能實現，亦絕對不擬總辭職。此外，本內閣並不因企業整備之困難，而不着手予以準備，近在確立失業對策後，將以合理及常識的手段，盡量使失業者減少。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿日電〕此間政界預料，片山內閣似已發生嚴重困難，有進行改組或提出辭呈之可能。據稱：關於國務方面，外務大臣蘆田均與內閣宮官長西尾末廣間之隙痕，已日趨擴大。片山內閣之內部衝突，計有下列各項因素：（一）對於西尾不顧蘆田之職務，或經由中央聯絡部（係有薩田任長官）之正常途徑而直接與盟軍總部商討國家事務，民主黨大爲憤怒。（二）煤礦國有及其他社會法案之延期進行。（三）來栖出任大藏大臣及社會黨左翼份子和田博雄出任經濟安定部長官。</p>

<h3>舞女方珍安葬　黃土一坏長眠地下　捧花臨穴恩客神傷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本月六日在復興公園盛裝自殺，事前預營墓穴，寄發遺書而後從容服毒之舞女方珍，其遺體已於昨晨十時自安樂殯儀館移葬於虹橋公墓，送葬者僅其生前稔客曾永祥一人，方之親屬舅父朱春寳與表姊朱芳菊均未到塲，故墓地冷寂無聲，景像凄凉之至。</p>
<p>曾永祥持鮮花兩束，覆於方珍棺上，黯然良久。棺爲杉木製，前部刻有龍鳳圖案及「廣東中山方珍女士之壽亭」字樣，即爲方珍生前向中國壽器公司所預定者。墓穴在虹橋公墓西側，地勢較低，離羣墓有相當距離，孑然一穴，積水盈半。殯工先將積水肆去，灑以大量石灰，然後將靈柩落土。方生前向建華大理石公司定好之石碑（曾囑於碑上鐫一小鳥兩面鑲花）昨尚未刻好，故墓上僅以黃土掩覆。建華公司有王名　者，與方係素識，昨亦到塲照料，方在向其定碑之時，僞稱有妹患肺病將死，故爲之立碑。在自殺之前一日，又詣王處，自稱將赴外埠，如妹死，務請將碑安放妥當，斯時王固不知所謂妹渚，即係方珍本人也。方柩入土後，曾永祥悄然離去，渠對方生前爲人猶盛讀不已，並稱此後將當携鮮花，來獻於方之墓前。紅顏薄命，得此知客，亦足安慰於地下矣。尤有一事足述者，則殯工數人，聞悉方自殺經過，對於其生前自行佈置身後事之舉動，深爲感嘆，故願爲義務安葬，不受任何小費。</p>
<p>方有母，病歿於三年以前，亦營壟於虹橋公墓，方曾親爲之立碑紀念，其墓穴在公墓東側，距今方之墓約百碼。母女近鄰，當可相倚與地下矣。</p>

<p>黃氏生於廣東番禺，但長大於美國華盛頓州。黃氏之父，爲一農民，黃氏初八影城時爲一職業拳擊家，但至一九一六年，決心改行爲攝影師。在美生活逾三十年後，黃氏最近表示：余願意指出國人在美生活之困難及有利之點。以前者而言，國人自不免遭受歧視，例如在舊金山，華僑自成集團，聚居於此大城之中心，象徵中美兩種文化，雖近如比鄰，自有距離存在。惟在另一方面，美國正盡力爲中國訓練人才，以協助中國建設。</p>

<h3>利賣氣氛濃厚　華股越盤越低</h3>
<p>華股昨以　　　　邁將軍來華，係負另一使命之說，人心更受打擊。業中多頭再告潰散，業外游資仍抱觀望態度。維持匱乏，滿塲悲觀氣氛加重。各小型股黯然無光，塲外永紗，暗市復時斷時續，越盤越低。午刻有永公以及火柴中絲新光華豐跌至限度。晨初以銀根見鬆，各即交股除中法見低外，餘均見升。遞交各股却均開低，人心頽唐。遞美亞開後，即被賣至五〇〇元，現美亞降爲四九七元。信和亦由一六〇號八五號六〇號八四號八五號賣出，遞交退至六二九四〇元，即交成交不多，却僅止於二九五〇元。七一號七七號四二號八九號一五四號二一九號趁低補進，遞交美亞升爲五一八元。信和亦由一五七號一九號等來進，回升至三一〇〇元外。一八五號七七號八五號五四號一穴五號二一九號賣到遞美亞五〇二元後，有長時間之徘徊。自十時一刻迄十一時半，二一八號六一號二二三號七六號買進，九四號三五號一五二號則出，市價在五一〇元內外形呈拉鋸。十一時四十分後，散戶以塲外永紗喊價中斷，人心震動，一五二號一五五號八三號四號二三一號一一二號二一五號二三二號連袂了結，遞美亞一破五〇〇元大關後，十二時起，面目全非。永公即交由六七號，遞交由一二六號，遞新光由八四號，首先跌至限度。遞華豐以及中絲火柴亦迫限度，遞美亞跌至四六九元。即交者降至四六三元。八五號一〇六號二一九號八四號供給，離跌停限度甚近，臨收時一八六號一五四號二三號雖售，八五號等補進不已，遞美亞升爲四八四元。遞信和由八五號買進，亦升至二九五〇元收市。收後遞美亞由二三一號脫手，而在四八〇元左右掙扎。結果較上週六計即交股永公跌停，信和華蠻新光美亞中法各跌一成半左右，景福勤興跌一成，新華跌半成，榮豐水泥新亞內衣各跌一成，統益大通五和景綸跌成半弱，商務國貨麗安微挫，火柴於臨收時跌至限度。遞交股計永公跌停，華豐新光跌停後有回，軋跌成半弱，信和跌一成，美亞景福勤興華豐各跌一成半左右。塲外各老股計華商閘北大生跌落半成，餘者平疲而已。</p>

<p>外股昨亦遭影響，買氣銷沉，僅由散戶支持，證券帮及洋商均有了結。情妙晨開六七〇〇〇元盤低至六四〇〇〇元，而後略定，結景較上週六計電話尚穩，抬紗英聯　　航業鐫業各跌一成，餘股各降半成有零，僅橡皮股尚形平和。</p>

<h3>茶市交易寥落</h3>
<p>綠茶中之抽珍·珍　·珠茶等花色，向以暢銷法屬摩洛哥爲大宗，但自生產成本高於海外售價後，出口迄鮮起色。　來因本市永興洋行不惜成本，擬大量推銷彼地，致目前上項花色，問津者逐漸增多。惜市存薄弱，加以貨方一味居奇扳售，趨勢　有供不應求之憾，交易咸僅零星，行情則愈扳愈俏。且三十五年度　源大帮及珠茶，每擔各比上週軋升四五萬元左右。至於其他情色，仍祗擋陳紅茶，午昌茶葉公司需求頗股，市氣依然穩定。他若內銷茶，本街店莊續有添置，而客帮各路，胃納亦佳，過程乃一致不義。</p>
<h3>油商業公會　訂定買賣條約</h3>

<h3>產地米價大跌　粳秈一致見挫</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市，共到米糧三千四百餘石，內地狂跌消化呆滯，浙江新秈首批來申，市况一蹶不振。人心搖動，粳秈元米一致亂跌二三四萬元不一。</p>
<p>麵粉因內地堅挺，隨之穩定，微升千元。麩皮平局，豆餅實銷仍　，略　千元。營口餅跌二三千元，黃豆消化亦淡，挫跌三五千元。漢口事實最爲呆木，狂跌萬元。菉　提高殺次甚烈，中次者受主難覓，猛跌一二其元。高貸南洋動辦，　挺萬元。</p>

<h3>棉紗市况閒散</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，緣經監團紗布組將成立，並聞今後經常派員在塲監視，致塲中人心甚形虛怯，多頭了結頗衆，而同業吸意不健，客帮亦乏進取。又逢紡建開售，籌碼充沛，市氣回挫。迨至最後，四二支藍鳳價做低至一千七百六十萬元，比上週六回挫四十萬元。廿支特雙馬亦降三十萬元爲一千二百七十萬元。雙紗馬爲一千零七十萬元，下挫二十萬元，十六支光明軋小五十萬元，價獨鉅，爲九百五十萬元。其餘各紗扯降一二十萬元至三四十萬元不等。</p>
<h3>棉布腳地虛軟</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，因同業銀根仍緊，拋售甚勁，客路廣帮，以運輸困難，亦有吐售，市上大戶脫手尤多，致脚地更形虛軟。結果十二磅龍頭細布價低至四十三萬六千元，較週六回降一萬七八千元。五福彩球藍鷄陽鶴等各檔細布，亦挫一萬五六千至二萬左右。其餘白坯漂布粗布及嗶嘰元布等市，多一致下挫，惟藍布及士林布市，則堅疲不一。</p>
<h3>現棉微疲</h3>

<h3>勒令停業之銀行　已漸次淸理完畢</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中失銀行稽核處處長李立俠談稱：財政部近半年來勒令停業之金融機構，有建國銀行，成大銀號，江海銀行，大同商業銀行等四家。該行號等均經財部委託中央銀行派請稽核監督淸理。茲建國成大兩家，業已淸理完畢。江海亦可告一段落，大同存款本少，淸理當無問題。</p>
<p>查建國及成大之存款，大部均已淸償，尚餘少數朱提淸之有款，屬於建國者，可向該行昆明分行提取。屬於成大者，可向該號重慶總號提取。大同存款殊少，現該行存中央銀行及票據交換所之通備金，已足以償付全部存款。江海銀行本市儲蓄部存款，業已還淸。業務方面尚有少數存款，亦可不成問題，即待派請稽核監督淸理。</p>
<p>又各淸理行莊所存國行之存款準備金，國行均按其發還存款數，比例發還，凡此均另列淸理專戶調撥之。</p>
<p>李氏末談：此次檢查金融行莊要旨，在取締黑市金鈔及外匯，目的在協助金融行莊步入正規途徑，並不在消極的促使閉歇淸理。蓋一家行莊之成立，勢須經過長時期之籌劃，集中資本人力，而後克底於成，故積極扶植，尤感需要云。</p>

<p>國外則有越南之河內，西貢等二單位。截止本年底止，本行分支機構，總計二二三單位，較卅四年底增加七十單位。</p>
<p>儲蓄業務情形</p>
<p>本行對于推行儲蓄業務，一本過去精神，不斷努力，藉以提倡節約　吸收市塲游資。本年度並時予注意于工礦員工之水額儲蓄，幷改進敎育儲蓄，以宏成效。値茲物價動盪，市拆高昻，環境上對于招攬儲蓄，，原極不易。然本行儲蓄數李仍能逐年增高。本年原訂儲蓄增存目標爲四十億元，截至年底，除有獎儲券，美金儲券，折金存款，及鄉鎭公益儲券外，較三十之四年底，計增加五十二億元，超過目標十餘億元。嗣後國內經濟情勢，倘能趨于安定，則以本行歷史之悠久，信譽之昭孚，儲蓄業務之更見發展，當可預卜。</p>

<h3>達密凌蘇龍夫人　從蒙古共區歸來</h3>
<p>— 本報記者劉映元</p>
<p>歸綏十二日航訊</p>
<p>遂密凌蘇能夫人郭增祥女士，於上月下旬偕二公子達錦益，帶殯軍隊和牛羊馬羣，從察北東蘇尼特旗，逃出蒙共割據的「錫察軍區」，經四晝夜沙漢行軍，回到了綏東集寗縣附近的十二蘇木。這次達夫人和公子來歸祖國，不僅說明了蒙胞內向，人心思漢，她還以親身的經歷，告給我們錮禁在內外蒙邊境的蒙胞的悲慘生活。以下的記載，便是達夫人以細膩口吻，向記者描繪的、一幅弱小民族的流亡圖。</p>
<p>外蒙軍入綏</p>
<p>前年八月十號日本宣佈投降，外蒙的軍隊以卡車進入綏境，陰曆七月二十日到了十二蘇木，當下就把東四旗的防衛師繳械。那時達密凌蘇龍任正黃旗總管，兼僞蒙軍第七師師長，他的軍隊調到包頭以西的東公旗駐防，德王害怕達密凌蘇龍跟傅長官取得連絡，把他本人送到察北新明縣軟禁。因爲達密凌蘇龍是察哈爾部落一位最顯赫的人物民國初年他任正黃旗參領時，曾到外蒙把德王由哲布尊丹巴的賊營中奪回，以後任島得到滂江的守備隊長，使蒙匪不敢進入察綏。二十五年李守信和王英進犯紅格爾圖時，達密凌蘇龍率領騎兵協助國軍作戰，所以外蒙對他非常重視，陰曆七月二十日去十二蘇木撲了一個空，到陰曆八月初十硬把達密凌蘇龍在新明縣找見，隨後解押至商都縣城加以監視。</p>
<p>那次外蒙軍隊進入察綏，並沒有和日本軍隊作戰，完全在於趁火打刦，虜掠壯丁和物資，並覓尋內蒙自治的傀儡。他們把達密凌蘇龍扣起，强迫他下令將隊伍從東公旗調回，並揚言給內蒙軍隊換用俄式新槍，把達密凌蘇龍的武器，完全裝備了僞蒙軍第九師師長烏勒吉熬蘇爾臨時雜凑的部隊。外蒙將達密凌蘇龍扣起還不甘心，復於陰曆八月二十一又去十二蘇木，達密凌蘇龍的長公子達錦綱也架至商都。達錦綱畢業中央軍校，抗戰時期追隨傅長官在張礪生部充任別動司令，他奉令回正黃旗收容由商都逃出的僞七師官兵，不幸他的普通步槍，抵擋不過外蒙軍的自動武器，結果被綁上汽車，和他父親幽囚在一起，最後隨烏勒吉熬蘇爾，押解到庫倫，至今還打聽不見下落。據烏勒吉熬蘇爾告達天人說，是在一個秘密地方受訓。</p>
<p>日本投降以後，內蒙各旗的官民，都感到非常驚喜，喜歡的是脫離敵僞的壓迫，重見祖國的天日，驚恐的是漢人抬起頭來，向蒙古人施行報復。外蒙方面和烏勒吉熬爾就利出後一種心理，煽惑蒙民携帶家屬牲畜向外蒙出走。詳細的數字沒有正確的統計，僅是牛馬就佈滿了張庫公路的兩翼。不料軍隊和人民在德王府集</p>
<p>內蒙「獨立」透視</p>
<p>「察綏兩省的蒙胞已經跟上德王，嚐過一段獨立的痛苦，現在提起八年來的往事猶有餘哀，所以今天對雲澤提倡的自治都感覺不到興趣」。達密凌蘇龍夫人談及此次內蒙自治，是以這一段話做爲首先的自白。她說三十四年八月十日德王離開張家口，當時一蒙胞看見日本投降，共有七百多一人自動組織起一個蒙古同鄉會，以維特蒙胞生命財產的安全。到八月二十三日雲澤隨共軍進入張垣，奉共軍總部命令到蒙古同鄉會活動，煽惑靑年，拉攏王公，於十一月二十一日，召開內蒙自治運動聯合大會，內設執行委員會及常務委員會，下轄組織，軍事，宣傳，婦女，靑年五部及秘書處，並附蒙古報社，蒙古衛生局，蒙古實業公司，及蒙古學院。各盟旗及參領區，皆有分會與支會。常務會主席，軍事部長，實業公司董事長，蒙古學院院長皆由雲澤一人包辦，其它各組織亦由共產黨員把持計（一）秘書長劉春（共），秘書處長劉景平（共），參謀長昌都固楞，組織部長奎璧（共），副部長高佈扎布（共），宣傳部長黃靜（共），婦女部長閔仲（共），衛生局長胡爾沁必立格，蒙古報社長勇夫（共），實業公司經理趙雲駛（共），副理關起義（共）。（二）蒙古學院敎育長朱榮（共），行政部主任蘇鏡（共），軍事部主任韓鳳（共）。（三）第一支隊長李秀山，政委韓鳳（共）所在地哈布嘎。第二支隊長李友桐，約四個師，在東北王爺廟海拉爾一帶。第三支隊長海福隆，察北第四支隊長烏勒吉敖蘇爾，在綏東察北流竄。（四）察哈爾盟盟長陳炳宇（共），副盟長哈斯瓦齊爾，分會主任蘇劍嘯（共）。烏蘭察布盟盟長墨爾根巴圖，副盟長兼分會主任雲一立（共）。巴彥搭拉盟盟長兼分會主任奎璧（共）。錫林祁勒盟盟長松王，副盟長兼分會主任皓信（共）。這些人裏邊有中以後，　蒙將壯了車馬牛羊帳幕統統帶　，把女人小孩和老漢究全留下　所以烏勒吉熬蘇爾一共朝內蒙虜走一萬多壯丁，結果祗有二百多士兵換成俄式裝備，跟他由外蒙返回內蒙，其餘都在沿途逃跑，剩下的齊在庫倫西邊的深山中開礦。留在德王府的眷屬多妻離子散以乞討苦度時日，前年冬天和去年冬，有好多凍死在草地。不少漢人，他們的工作並沒有伸展至各處，便因去年十月國軍收復張家口，而將內蒙古自治聯合會瓦解。</p>
<p>本年五月二十日內蒙東西兩部赤色份子，與外蒙取得連擊之後，在遼北省王爺廟召開國民大會，決定成立內蒙人民自治政府，由毛澤東推薦雲澤爲主席兼外交部長，博彥滿都爲副主席，哈豐嘎爲秘書長，靑年組訓部長祁漠南，人民組織部長奎璧，軍事部長李友桐，內政部長阿思根，經濟部長特木爾巴根，司法部長那木司賴扎布。內蒙自治政府現有三個軍團，東蒙軍團司令員祁文林，號稱有十個師，實際兵力四五萬人，不過由某方供給武器。錫察巴烏兩軍團由烏勒吉敖蘇　担任司令員，以五千多人編爲七個師，十一師師長烏勒吉敖蘇爾自兼，十二師師長巴海明，十三師師長腦本達賴，十四師師長李盛，十五師師長雲繼珍，十六師師長李秀山，十七師師長海福隆。東蒙的軍隊都是「滿洲國」的僞軍，西蒙都是「蒙疆政府」的僞軍，表面上雖然團結一致，實際上東西的界綫即爲分明，並且在西蒙內部，亦有錫察和巴盟裂痕。據說東蒙由某方直接指揮補給，西蒙由中共指揮補給。在僞政府里邊，以哈豐嘎的力量最大，自從祁道夫死後，即由他領導內蒙古靑年革命黨，郭漢南·李友桐·郭文林等都是他的幹部，雲澤不過充任傀儡而已，他經常不在王爺廟，現在貝子廟，西蒙靑年跟着他流竄，非常灰心失望，最近逃到張家口的很多。</p>
<p>達密凌蘇龍夫人和二公子達錦益，是去年七月間害怕共軍在綏東算帳，由十二蘇木投往察北，他們在東蘇尼特旗的烏蘭淖地方，一共避了一年多災難。共軍爲了爭取達密凌蘇龍，他們的財產還沒有受過重大損失。不過附近的蒙古財主，都被共軍捐窮，貧民因爲沒有人僱用放收牛羊，普遍陷入飢饉。錫林郭勒盟各旗王公，有的被虜往外蒙，有的逃到張家口，地方呈無政府狀態，有三五十枝槍就可以到處橫行。西蒙的共軍在德王時代，過慣了城市鄉村生活，回到義古草地非常感覺蹩扭，察錫兩盟的人到熱河找李守信去了，巴烏兩盟的人却紛紛回家。這一次傳主任派出騎車兵團和綏遠保安師鄂友三的騎兵，前往察北剿匯，已經將巴烏軍區打垮。十五師師長雲　珍被俘，海陳隆剩下’一百多人，烏勒吉敖蘇爾從前和共軍綏　軍區的康健民旅，在西蘇尼特旗的忽爾格廟共同建立着一個根據地，自從前年迄未到得外蒙的接濟，並且康健民退到山西以後，已經有三個多月沒來察北，所以烏勒吉敖蘇爾看了看在德王府附近無法立足，於六月初旬到阿巴噶左旗找雲澤去了。達錦益還告給記者說，西蒙是前淸的內屬蒙古，民國二年外蒙宣佈獨立，西蒙是站在　國方面和哲布尊丹巴作戰，尤其綏省的蒙胞，受傅主任的影響極深，二十五年曾以察綏分浩粉碎了德王在百靈廟的蒙政會，抗戰剿匪期間綏蒙大多歡人民擁護政府，所以西蒙得不到某方和外蒙的信任，傅主任如果經常派兵在察北駐防，蒙匪的叛國毒燄，必定局限於東蒙，而無法向西蔓延，事實上綏蒙已經底定，察蒙的匪患也漸近尾聲。達密凌蘇龍夫人郭增祥女士，出身於滿洲的貴族門庭，公子達錦益初中畢業，漢文成績很好。</p>
<p>逃出了虎口</p>
<p>達密凌蘇龍夫人和公子，由十二蘇木進入察北的　共地區，一方面是害怕綏東共軍淸算鬥爭，一方面在於打聽達密凌蘇龍的下落，並且企圖藉此保存八十多個衛隊的武器。他們到東蘇尼特旗住了八九個月，烏勒吉敖蘇爾陰言鬼語的始終沒有告訴給他們正確的消息，並且計劃繳他們的槍枝，他們於絕望之後，使萌下逃出的念頭。今年陰曆三月十八日先由達錦益秘密回到歸綏，向董主席表明態度，然後回到烏蘭淖將牛羊集中起來，於上月十七日利用傅主任派出汽車兵團剿除察北蒙共的機會，由正黃旗的應援部隊，才把他們接到商都附近的新民縣城。和他們一同逃出的，還有東蘇尼特旗五十多戶蒙民，現由正黃旗撥出草塲，讓這些失掉帳棚的人放牧牛羊。</p>
<p>迎接達夫人和公子來歸的，是正黃旗的反內亂先鋒隊這種部隊在綏省十八個蒙旗都有，旨在四出剿除零星共匪。達夫人在最近兩三個月以來人馬的糧食補給，全靠正黃旗反內亂先鋒隊秘密運輸。因爲共區的蒙民非常痛恨奸匪，所以他們從不把達夫人跟綏東的來往向烏勒吉敖蘇爾告發。正黃旗反內亂先鋒隊隊長漢名任得勝，在達密凌蘇龍部下担任過連長，這次他帶了四十多個兵，除了把達夫人和東蘇尼特旗的難民護送到綏東，還在去烏蘭淖的路上，行經西蘇尼特旗阿不蓋圖山時，將共軍的巴烏工作委員會主任委員孟克吉勒格爾擊斃，該人曾留學蘇聯，共軍盤據綏東時任僞正紅旗總管。</p>
<p>蒙古人原先以爲中共叛亂，是漢人內部的事情，在最近兩年以來，他們才知道全世界的共黨是一家人。蒙共目前雖然還沒實行淸算政策，但是他們知道祗要軍事成功以後，地痞流氓馬上要起來翻身鬥爭，正如外蒙　實布獨立並沒有實行共產，等到哲布尊丹巴被弒後，人民的厄運跟着來臨。達密凌蘇龍夫人原先離開綏東，未必不是像擺脫開國共的戰爭，到後來感覺到泥淖愈陷愈沉，老漢和大兒子都被俘虜去了，第二個兒子也有走上他父兄道路的可能。所以她趕快脫出苦海。現在達夫人提起共產黨談虎色變，她告記者說下半年打算送二公子到北平繼續求學，她也不敢回十二蘇木，預備經常住在集寗縣城料理家務。現在靠近外蒙邊境的蒙民紛紛往大靑山附近移動，四子王旗的　五，達爾罕旗的沙貝子，藏明安旗的記名扎薩克奇淸康，自從日本投降後，一直就在歸綏做着寓公。</p>
<h3>工會對共產黨應有的警覺</h3>
<p>— 美國國際婦女服裝會主席D．Dubinsky原著　本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>無論在那一個國家，共產黨在工會裏面的活動，不但影響到有組織的工會運動，而且對於人民的福利與安寗會發生重大的障害。</p>
<p>共產黨無孔不入，他們在中央的指揮下，深入敎會團體，敎育機關，婦女俱樂部，科學社團，甚至商人的團體。但是工會向來是他們的特殊目標，要是不能控制工會，共產黨就要失敗。工會是他們的經濟基點，要是不能指揮工人團體，其他的聯絡都將失去效用。勞工組織在社會裏是最大最重要的非政府團體。他們是精細的現代生活機體的一部分。</p>
<p>勞工之屋</p>
<p>共產黨在工會中的活動是有其重大的意義的。他們像白蟻一樣鑽進了「勞工之屋」，可是由於集權主義的精神與目的，與自由的工會主義的理想與政策大相逕庭的緣故，他們還沒有變爲勞工機構的主要部份。</p>
<p>自由的工會主義也許有其缺點，但是這些缺點是可以補救的，因爲工會的辦事程序，雖然有時候也許不能吻合理想，但是它們的精神是民主的。</p>
<p>但是潛入工會和其他組織的共產主義是具有陰謀的。它的基本政策是排除服從多數的規則，目的在建立一黨專政的國家，而以工會作爲達到此一目的的階石。</p>
<p>特務人員</p>
<p>共產黨攫取工會的方法是很簡單的：先由黨的特務人員認定一個預備攫取的工會會員，與之交往，再逐漸拉攏志同道合的少數會員，在特務人員的協助下，擬定一個適合共產黨黨綱的計劃。</p>
<p>起初，那黨代表揀中了一位略知議實程序的工會會員，然後把塲面佈置好，把那不知內情的會員介紹給一位重要職員或著名的黨發言人，並且帶他參加各種鷄尾酒會和跳舞會。</p>
<p>其次，是在工會開會時的活動。會議還沒有正式開始時，共產黨「份子」就開始動作，由一個不知內情的會員先提動議，接着開始辯論，往往延至深夜，想早睡覺的會員逐漸溜出了會塲，於是共產然佔了優勢，投票的結果，他們終於得到了勝利。</p>
<p>共產黨不能單獨行動，必須得到幫助。他們必須成爲一個羣衆，一個「聯合陣綫」或「人民陣綫」的一部分。因爲他們熟譜開會的技巧，因爲他們不擇任何手段，不避任何欺詐，所以他們總能衝在前面的。</p>
<p>不過共產黨「份子」不一定推選本黨黨員來佔據工會主席職位。他們可以找出一位優柔溫順而有前途的非共產黨員來担任主席的名義，而作爲實際控制工會的一種掩護。當然，秘書會計和組織部長等實際職位，必須屬於共產黨員。</p>
<p>一種烟幕</p>
<p>共產黨的整個機構是高度集中的，即所謂「民主的中央集權」。但這不過是一種烟幕而已。他們的機構是預備迅速行動的，因爲在黨的方針交下時，必須照盲目的軍事紀律絕對服從，沒有加以辯論的餘地，只有「討論和贊成」。</p>
<p>共產黨自譽爲勞工的「先鋒」，這完全是欺人之談。實際上他們往往藉黨派的鬥爭破壞了許多工會。他們自稱是「進步份子」，但其實是「暴烈的反動份子」，如某些人所加給他們的稱呼。</p>
<p>在他們看來，倫理和道德，只是「資產階級」的德性，所以在工會裏面，對於一個保守份子或反動份子，只要他能够贊成親蘇或親共方針，也會予以支持。</p>
<p>極權色彩</p>
<p>很明顯的，親共份子所以能在勞工大衆裏面獲得進展，是由於非共黨的工會份子崇尚虛榮和缺乏節操的緣故。而機會主義又是一種司空見慣的的品性。</p>
<p>就是在我們的國際工會中，任何當地的職員，不管他如何保守或無能，祗要對有利蘇聯外交政策或共黨方針的決議案，便可免受共產黨的指責，甚至得到他們的支持。</p>
<p>在共黨看來，決定一個工會領袖「進步色彩」的尺度，不是他的勞工政策是否健全，而是他的是否願意贊同蘇聯政策。我所以認共產黨爲極權的反動份子，原因在此。</p>
<p>事實上，眞正前進的工會領袖最受這輩左傾份子的攻擊，而保守的工會領袖倒反太平無事。理由很簡單：自由主義的工會派洞悉共產黨的歷史和陰謀，能够不受他們的欺騙。國際婦女服裝業工會多年來一直受共產黨的攻擊，原因即在於此。</p>
<p>控制手段</p>
<p>共產黨常卜晝卜夜地拼命工作，企圖控制進步的工會。以這些工會爲根據地，他們才能對比較保守的工會堡壘發動攻勢。一經控制了若干進步的工會，他們的勢力便伸入整個勞工運動的核心和決策機構。這表示共產黨在各種委員會和團體中有代表參加，可以覲見總統，涉足重要的政府部門，並接近秘密的情報而遞給黨內的委員。</p>
<p>共產黨有時也爲改善勞工地位而奮鬥，此點我並不否認。但是祇有在這種政策和蘇聯統治者的利益不相衝突時，他們纔肯這樣幹。假如他們認爲對雇主放棄要求，或忽視工人的疾苦，或從事最大限度的「階級合作」對他們有利的話，他們就會這樣做。</p>
<p>後果種種</p>
<p>假使共產黨一旦控制了美國工會運動的話，會產生什麼後果呢？</p>
<p>讓我們援引著名蘇聯工會領袖湯姆斯基的話來解答這個問題：『假使有一個時間我們可以想像得到，德國所有的工會明天會和德國共產黨駢肩進軍，那麼我們可以斷定：在這兩大力量結合以後的五分鏡內，就會成立一個蘇維埃政府……假使有一個時間我們想像得到，英國工會和共產黨結合起來的話，那麼一個蘇維埃政府也會迅速地在英國建立起來。」</p>
<p>很明顯的，共產黨攫取各種職位和獲得工會控制權的成功程度，不僅有關某一勞工團體的本身，而且對於整個國家有密切的關係。</p>
<p>今日的法國便是一個顯著而可悲的例證。法國共產黨現正支配着勞工總同盟。無疑的，法國共產黨對於選民的號召力，多半由於他們對金屬業，煤炭業，運輸業和其他主要勞工團體具有控制權的緣故。</p>
<p>假使有一天，共產黨對美國工會運動握有同樣的控制力，因而取得同樣決定性的政治地位，那麼美國在一個無情的外國極權獨裁政府的擺佈下，會感到同樣的不安和危險，國家的獨立會受到嚴重的威脅。</p>
<p>需要警覺</p>
<p>有人相信共產黨擅長組織的技能，這全然是無稽之談。工會內的進步和民主力量結成的堅强意志可以把他們擊敗。我們在國際婦女服裝工會所得到的經騐已一再證明這一個論斷。</p>
<p>國際婦女服裝業工會的一個擁有二萬五千會員的分會，最近曾舉行一次選舉，會內自認的或已知的共產黨員不到五百個。但是由於他們的活動，宣傳和造謠生事的伎倆，投票的結果他們竟獲得了五千票之多。假定衹有九千個會員實際參加投票，那麼，不到五百個共產黨員就可以控制一個擁有如此廠大會員的分會。幸賴進步勢力警覺，領導得法，且能使百分之八十的會員參加投票，纔能以三對一的比數將共產黨領導的力　擊敗。</p>
<p>工作方針</p>
<p>所以工會的進步份子，爲要應付這個局面，必須做到下面的幾點：</p>
<p>（一）我們組織工會內的多數會員，應和共產黨組織少數會員同樣努力。</p>
<p>（二）開明的工會主義者，不必藉禁止共黨宣傳來阻遏共黨的潛入。排除共黨在政治舞台上的地位，或禁止共黨加入工會，都不是和共黨門爭的有效辦法。我們必須信賴敎育，逐日討論各項勞工問題。</p>
<p>（三）我們必須盡力使勞工大衆充分瞭解出席會議和担負責任的重要。對於商店及工廠內的痛苦，必須率先去解決。因爲進步的工會份子如不參加這些工作，共產黨就會來包辦以達到他們的目的</p>
<p>（四）爲確保工會的決議眞正反映多數的意志起見，各分會應約束會　必須出席各項會議和參加各項選舉，藉以防止共產黨以少數控制工會的企圖。</p>
<p>（五）我們身爲工會領袖者必須以身作則，努力工作，力求日常勞工問題的解決，如改善工作狀况，提高生活水準，保障政治權益等。</p>
<p>（六）積極的勞工領袖不可濫唱高調，去和共產黨爭勝。</p>
<p>假使我們依照這些方針做去，我們每次和共產黨較量時，就不難戰勝他們在工會內佔據的勢力。這些共產黨的細菌，正如其他的病菌一樣，最易在黑暗與無知中滋長。在領袖和會員都很警覺，忠實和能幹的工會裏面，他們是不會繁殖的。（譯自本年五月十一日紐約時報週刋）</p>

<h3>纖維之島　紙業管窺</h3>
<p>— 靈峯</p>
<p>如北十二日航訊</p>
<p>伴隨着中國文化的低落，紙業在中國也是素不發達的，在日本人經營下比較有規模的東北紙業，在戰後被無情的摧殘了，天津的造紙廠聽說將要標售，目下比較有希望的製紙工業，恐怕只有隸屬於資委會與台灣省政府合辨的台灣紙業公司，該不容諱言。</p>
<p>合灣因爲原材料豐富，造紙一向很發達，過去日人時代着重在蔗漿生產，因爲台灣糖業的獨步遠東，有取用不竭的蔗渣可以利用，其中以台南廠（舊名鹽水港紙漿會社）產量最鉅，日產蔗漿達一百噸，台北廠（舊名羅東台灣興業株式會社）生產以洋紙爲主，日產四十八噸，士林廠（舊名台灣製紙會社）日產紙板二十噸。上列產量超過本省的需要甚鉅，紙張過剩，多賴對外輸出以資調節。如紙漿過去多輸返日本加工製紙，洋紙一部輸往我國沿海一帶，紙板主要輸南洋及我國東北及華北，曾獲致很好的聲譽。光復以後，紙業公司的各造紙工廠在接收人員的分別監理下，繼續開工，但是戰爭期間，工廠被破壞了，原材料缺乏，機械器材又無法補充，所以產量激减，與過去比較不可以道里計。</p>
<p>去往五月，紙業公司正式成立，乃接收了各廠，埋頭於復舊工事，修補添購，總設法努力增產，但最困難的是毛布與銅絲布的不繼，舊的千瘡百孔，實在不堪再用，而新的向國外訂購又姍姍來遲，影響生產不淺，目前總算陸續交到一批所定的器材，所屬五個工廠已能全部開工，今後台灣紙業的增產，實在是中國一個極有希望的工業。下面是最近該公司各廠的產銷情形：</p>
<p>從一月至五月：台北廠共產洋紙（包括新聞紙印刷用紙）一，〇九一噸，銷售九〇九噸。</p>
<p>士林廠共產紙板一，七五一噸，銷售一，二六三噸。</p>
<p>合中廠共產洋紙六二六噸，銷售四四六噸。</p>
<p>台南廠共產蔗板七〇，九八八張，銷售一三，一八〇張。</p>
<p>高雄廠共產洋紙一三噸。</p>
<p>以上銷售所得，合共合幣二億餘元，裝滬紙板及道林紙約直二十億元。</p>
<p>爲了增加生產，推廣銷路，紙業公司針對着擬定了今後的計劃。預計此後月產新聞紙二〇〇噸，印刷用紙七五〇噸，包裝紙一〇〇噸，袋用紙二〇〇噸，黃紙板四〇〇噸、白紙板二〇〇噸，紙漿一，二五〇噸，除掉在省內推銷外，擬向京滬區銷售印刷用紙四二五噸，袋用紙八〇噸，包裝紙三〇噸。黃白紙板各一五〇噸，紙漿九〇〇噸；向華南推銷印刷用紙一〇〇噸，黃紙板五〇噸；向南洋推銷黃紙板一〇〇噸，這個計劃倘可以完成，台灣紙業自將發揮貢獻中國文化事業更大的力量，紙業公司的總經理是交大老教授謝惠博士，頭髮已經斑白了，他咬着烟斗，精神像個年靑人那樣旺盛，他說他無論如何要促使這個計劃的實現的。</p>
<h3>廣州改制後　在新生途上邁進</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員梁風</p>
<p>十七日航訊</p>
<p>由於全省水災的嚴重，一片沉警的空氣正籠單着廣州全城，百多萬市民幾乎每一個人的心上，都壓了一塊沉重的鉛塊；因爲這三十年來空前的浩刧，已經直接間接地影響到每一個市民身上了！在這時候，祗有一個使人興奮的消息，就是廣州奉准恢復爲院轄市。雖然這不過是行政上的改制，但市旣升格了，市府的官員也升級了，而市民的地位也彷彿跟着升了格；雖然做一個特別市的市民未見得要比普通市民威風一點，但大家總想到：廣州在改制以後，將來政費當然略較充裕，而且還可以希望中央直接的補助，而作種種視利市民的建設；大家都憧憬着一個建設新廣州的遠景，是多麼的美麗而燦爛；所以大家在一方面集中力量救濟災民，一方面熱烈地慶祝廣州改特的成功；使這沉鬱的空氣，也豁然開朗起來。</p>
<p>市民期望　廣州新生</p>
<p>本來，廣州是華南最大的都市，在經濟，文化，社會，國際上都佔有重要的位置，人口亦已超過百萬，而且又是有過光榮歷史的革命策源地。它早已其有了特別市所有的條件。可是復員以後，因爲是省轄市的緣故，市庫收入有限，而復員建設費的補助也和特別市差得很遠，致一切市政設施難於開展。兩年以來，雖然經過當局悉心的策劃，大槪就是由於經濟的關係，致使許多計劃不能推行，或者推行而不能澈底；這正如一個營養不足的人一樣，處處表現出不健全的狀態。我們客觀一點來說，至今天爲止，一切的市政設施，都實在未能滿足市民的要求；我們看吧：物價不斷的高漲，現在已追上了京滬一帶，房屋荒始終是個嚴重的問題，械刧案並不比以前减少，電燈不明，電話不靈，馬路不平，自來水不淸還是一樣的保留着，也不見改進到怎樣，尤其是流行着敵偽時代遺下的所謂「熟性」（賄賂的意思）風氣始終無法掃除，警察可以公然向攤販收「熟性」費，甚至連市民向工務局報建房屋，都故意諸多留難；這一切汚點的存在，自然是有着許許多多的因素；在當局自然更有着相當的困難；所以一般市民都祗有希望，這些難滿人意的現實環境，從此使它成爲過去，大家再虔誠地等待着：廣州的新生降臨！</p>
<p>市長處事　穩重認眞</p>
<p>廣州改制後的市長，仍由原任的歐陽駒市長蟬聯而且人事上沒有怎樣更動，這都是市民們値得高興的；因爲這樣對原有的一切計劃，都可貫澈實施，不至因人事的更動而妨碍推行了。歐陽市長是廣東中山人，保定軍校六期畢業，早年參加革命，曾任國民革命軍獨立第一師副師長，第十七師師長，虎門要塞司令，廣東省會警察局長，粵贛閩邊區副總司令，及廣東省政府委員兼秘書長等職；他對做事的經騐，自然是相當豐富，尤以他在警察局長任內時，對廣州警政的優良建設，到現在還是爲一般市民所稱道的；大概因爲他是軍人出身，所以脾氣有點燥急，不過對人尚和靄可親，而對事則非常認眞，毫不苟且；而且着重實際不好空談；所以在廣州改制之日他對記者的談話，就特別說明他是個實事求事者，對今後的施政，是視市民所急切需要者而先爲之，決不怕困難，更決不推諉；意思就是一切將以事實來表現，不必預先發表什麼偉大的計劃，免使將來萬一不能實現時，成了一張不兌現的空頭支票，反受大家的指摘；單從這一點來看，也可見他處事的穩重和認眞了！</p>
<p>市府新猷　主要內容</p>
<p>其實，歐陽市長雖然從未有宣佈他的新計劃，但據記者向各方面調查所得，一切的市政建設，實在已在積極進行，其重要的內容，大約有以下幾項：</p>
<p>（一）整理災區規復建築：因爲廣州經過八年抗戰，災區遼闊，致屋荒問題，日趨嚴重；現在地政局已有了整個計劃，決定澈底整理，重測災區，劃淸界址，在短期內交都市建設委員審查核定後，即公布各原業主認領重建，如各業權人無力興建，則由政府先行籌墊建築，俟該災區復興繁榮後，始由各業權人分攤歸墊，這計劃成功後，不但房荒問題可以解決，而市區的繁榮，當更增百倍了。</p>
<p>（二）開闢西村河南兩工業區：廣州自復員後，由於外貨傾銷，原料來源缺乏以及工資過高等種種關係，工業一蹶不振，失業民衆日增，所以當局現擬定計劃，將西村劃爲重工業區，河南爲輕工業區，並獎勵華僑投資興辦，決予以相當的保障；如經實現，則市內生產建設固可增加，而失業民衆亦可救濟，社會則當更安定了。</p>
<p>（三）發展航業開關內港：廣州是華南交通口岸，來往船隻日多，現正積極進行開闢內港，以利發展各江航業，預算六個月內，即可完成。</p>
<p>（四）公用事業的分別整理：廣州電燈，電話，自來水等公用事業，始終未臻完善，已如上述；現在因爲市府向央行請貸的一百億已成功，並撥出四十億元作爲改進水電之用，現已分別積極整理；同時交通事業亦在改善中，提倡三輪車也收到了相當的效果，而續築馬路及改良街道，都在積極規劃了。</p>
<p>僑胞對粵　大量投資</p>
<p>除了上述以外，還有一個更佳的消息，就是最近南洋羣烏星加坡一帶僑胞，自動向廣州大量投資建設事業，由星加坡僑領發起籌集，預算初期的數目是一千五百億元；他們的計劃亦經擬定，準備在市區內分區建築二十六個最新型設備的大市塲，及在河南內港建築灣泊一萬至一萬五千噸輪船碼頭三座，新式巨型貨倉三座，現正積極擬製各項建築物的圖則；如這計劃能實現，就這二十六市塲，預算已能解決十萬以上街頭小販的業務與生活問題，而屆時市容當亦爲之一新了！</p>
<p>誠然，廣州改特後的一切市政建設，已在積極計劃開展了！由於歐陽市長是實事求事的人。我們應該相信，建設新廣州總不至是一句口號吧！</p>

<h3>答覆讀者的一封信　關於中國新文藝思潮</h3>
<p>— 趙淸閣</p>
<p>榮　先生：</p>
<p>申戰轉來您的信，以及另外一位讓者先生的信，你們的內容都差不多，你們不但關心我；而且關心中國新文藝思潮的動態；這使我非常感動，因爲你們是這樣的熱心文藝！爲了不辜負你們這種熱心文藝的熱情，雖在高度溽暑之下，我仍願和你們揮汗筆談。但這未嘗不是我的躱懶，我爲避免分頭寫信給你們，特此綜合地公開答覆，看起來雜亂無章，然而主題是不會超出「文藝」範疇的</p>
<p>您說，近三十年來中國的新文藝思潮之發展史，似乎是一直受着歐美文藝思潮的提携，從王爾德（Oscar　Wilde　1856-1900）的唯美主義到左拉（EmileZola1840-1902），莫泊桑（GuydeManpas　Sant　1850-1892），巴爾扎克（Honore　de　Bols-ac　1779-1850）的自然主義，寫實主義，至於最近新俄的新浪漫主義新寫實主義。我不否認這一串文藝思潮的變遷，間接地都相繼影響着中國新文藝思潮的進化；但我可否認它們是「提携」中國新文藝思潮進化的權威。我們知道歐美文藝思潮的變遷，也還是受着世整個思潮主流的策動。中國新文藝思潮同樣在這樣一個法則下直接被策動而進化着，而適應時代的要求。豈僅歐美文藝思潮的影響足以致效乎，由此我們應該明白近卅年來中國的新文藝思潮運動是獨立的，絕不是賴歐美文藝思潮所促成。講遠點，十八世紀初歐洲名著唐·吉訶德問世，正如您說，到現在還不失爲文藝傑作，而中國的元人施耐庵不是亦已著出流傳迄今的反映當時肚會情態，人民思想的傑作「水滸傳」了嗎？那時候總不能謂爲受歐美文藝思潮的影響吧！她是那個時代的產物，證明了中國文藝思潮早在數百年前獨立地奠定了進化的基礎。因此我得請　認淸中國文藝思潮原有其燦爛的史頁，其進化使然，絕非給目歐美文藝思潮的開拓，甚而「提携」。特別第二次世界大戰以後，整個世界思潮之透過資本主義，强權主義，進化爲民主主義，文藝思潮遂亦一躍而民主者，這個促起世田覺醒的功勞，實有賴於中國之對日抗戰。所以我們可以說，世界文藝思潮演變中之今日最新史頁，還是由中國揭發的。</p>
<p>至於您說到表現文藝思潮的中國文藝作品之量和質，還只是一個「未足月的孩子」，這話我承認，尤其在今日這個世界大戰剛剛結束，喘息未定的時候，中國文藝正待復興，建設，適又值國內戰亂不已，中國文藝作家一向在艱苦的生活環境下執筆就不易，如今生活環境更加艱苦，物質精神雙重壓迫，不似歐美文藝作家，國家予以生活的保陣，並思想自由發揮之權利，然則請問身爲中國一窮困文藝作家，憑什麽條件能產生令人令自己滿意的文藝作品來？我不是替中國文藝件家袒護或狡辯，這是事實！我敢說如果辛克萊，（UptonSinclair）羅曼羅蘭（RomainRolland）生在中國，任他們再有天才，恐怕也難能表現有如他在歐美產生的作品。所以，中國文藝作家在今日多半是消極了；雖也有少數還在與現實作着鬥爭的掙扎、但究竟勢孤力弱，不足以成其復興，建設之大業。自然這該是可悲的，然而這絕不是文藝作家的罪過。目前文藝作家們都變得感傷，憂懣，寫不出好的作品，爲了生活又不能不寫，使只有寫些　現實較遠的東西，譬如取材歷史；（像今日戲劇的演出，幾全係歷史翻造。）或追溯一些個人經騐的回憶。我就是這樣的一圖文藝寫作者。所以，三圓月的我接到北平的一位讀者來信，他質問我爲什麽盡寫比感傷的作品，勸我多寫些人民需要的文章；也就是代表人民苦悶的呼聲，爲人民注射强心劑。這封信我至今沒有覆他，我知道他要誤會我不接受他的善意的愛護，他更失望。但，他哪裏知道我看罷他的信是多麼感愧交集啊！我怎樣覆他呢？我能謊說我不感傷嗎？我是感傷！我能答應他我可以寫些人民要求的作品嗎？但環境不會允許我寫。於是我只有不回信，我時時記着道位讀者的好心，儘管我現在所寫的東西無內容，不够積極表現文藝思潮的進化，可是我願向關心我的讀者立誓，我會忠於文藝，在文字技巧上絕不苟且，粗濫；在主題意識上絕不放鬆眞理的探求；也絕不背棄正義的標幟。我是一個人道思想的自由主義之純文藝工作者？我絕不敢欺自己；或欺關心我的煩者；因爲我崇尚文讓，我是爲文藝而活的！不僅我，今日許多文藝作家們都是在這種狀態下工作個，生存着的！</p>
<p>現在我們再回到本題上來談談關於近三十年來的中國新文藝思潮發展史略，以及今日中國新文藝思潮的趨勢。但首先我請您建立起一個對中國文藝的自尊心來，相信中國文藝思潮史自有其演變的時代背景、也自有其獨立的生命，過去是如此，今後依然如此。決不會單純的爲受歐美文藝思潮之影響而轉移！</p>
<p>從一九一九年「五四」運動以後；到一九二五年「九一八」事變；到一九三七年「七七」抗戰；到一九四五年「九三」勝利，在這不算短的二十六年，中國新文藝受了歷來內外政治，經濟，社會，文化的影響；文藝思潮經過這幾個劃時代的歷史之演進，無論是對國家，對民衆，都發生了不可否認的一種推動性的力量。</p>
<p>我們可以把三十年來的中國新文藝，大略分爲三個階段：</p>
<p>（一）第一個階段——是反封建的「新興文藝」階段。時間是「五四」運動期間。提倡新興文藝的代表人物爲胡適之，陳獨秀，蔡元培先生等。</p>
<p>（二）第二個階段——是反帝國主義的「革命文藝」階段。時間是「九一八」事變前後。領導「革命文藝」的代表人物爲魯迅，郭沫若，茅盾，老舍先生等。</p>
<p>（三）第三個階段——是抗敵救亡的「國防文藝」階段，也有人說是「民族文藝一階段。時間是「七七」抗戰期間。領導「國防文藝」的代表者爲參加抗戰的文藝作家國體。</p>
<p>這三個階段都沒有離開過門爭，中國文藝便在這歷來鬥爭的過程裏面開了花，結了果，放了光彩！缺乏鬥爭性的文藝，是沒有生命力的，也就是沒有重心，文藝在鬥爭中進步，成長，直至現在，還是這樣。這鬥爭的性質，不管它是主觀的——爲文藝事業本身；或客觀的——爲人類社會；它的動機都是屬于正義感的。文藝之崇尚正義感、幾乎是天然的！所以鬥爭成爲文藝的必須條件。（所謂「正義感」，不過是一種純眞的善良的性靈之感應，絕非任何政治性的手腕，有人說正義感就是「左傾」，實在荒唐。其實它是不左不右適中正直的一種人生態度。）</p>
<p>在這種「正義感」的鬥爭大原則下，文藝思潮表面上是統「的，但由於人的個別立塲概念與時代認識之不同，所以不斷有着狹義的支離分歧流派行帮之存在，這現象在以上三個階段的每個階段中都很顯著，也都沒有什麽特別的發展。到了抗戰以後各流派行帮才自動地匿形隱迹。在全國文藝界抗敵救亡的眞理號召下面，又一致團結在一條戰綫上。八年以來，文藝作家們和武裝同志們一樣流着血——他們的心血。加上貧病的襲擊，也犧牲了不少性命，（無論是作戰死的，轟炸死的，患肺病死的）。但這並不足以使文藝作家們頺喪，大家都甘願嘔盡自己最後的一滴血，誰也不會爲成千成萬的結核菌所威脅！爲什麽？爲了大家只有一個慨念：就是國家至上，民族至上！</p>
<p>謝上帝，戰爭終於結束了，文藝和世界，和中國一樣，這受了烽火的破壞，誰都在呼　着復興！這個大時代的潮流，導引着世界，及中國一齊朝向一個和平建設的主流行進，這和平建設的主流是什麼？是民主！民主爲通過全人類集體意識的一種進步策略！它的哲理根據，是仁義道德觀的寬大。無我主義，乃綜多數意見，經客觀鑑定，取其精華以代替。它的意識形態是一種超然的，自由的，唯善唯美的。今日世界和中國都需要團結，而民主產目團結，不團結即無法民主，反之，不民主也自然無從團結。</p>
<p>文藝思潮隨着今日之政治，經濟、社會，文化背景而變遷，在一個進步世界觀的策動下無疑的也趨向着超然與自由，無論是爲了文藝事業的本身，或爲了人類社會，文藝都需要發揚一種眞正自由的思想情緒。從學問道德的修養上表現民主的基本精神，這基本精神的至高理想，則爲正義人道的維持。因此民主文藝是不容其思潮再有支離分歧的現象，任何文藝流派之存在，門戶之建立，都應該讓新時代的巨浪吞沒了！不如此，則文藝不足以烘托其新生命的力能，也不足以反映客觀現實，而發生一種促進今後政治，經濟，社會，文化之進化作用！所以，今日的文藝新思潮，可謂之爲和平建設的「民主文藝」階段。</p>
<p>民主文藝應當是今日文藝作家意識的標幟，文藝作家應當操持超然的氣節，把自由民主的文藝事業視作全世界的，全人類的和平建設事業；從作家的智慧之筆下，表現其作品的至高主題。但文藝作家在這個階段，必須放棄立塲慨念，把握客觀現實，眞理賴以發現，文藝可以得到新的估價，文藝復興必然成功，文藝事業也必然在歷史上不朽地永恒放射着最燦爛之光彩！</p>
<p>親愛的讀者先生，我這樣答復您所間的中國新文藝思潮發展史略和今後中國新文藝思潮動向的問題，不知道您認爲還滿意否？簡陃或不免，但請相信我是非常客觀而誠懇的！我希望我這封信能多少帮助您更深刻些了解中國新文藝思潮演變之自然形成，和歐美文藝思潮的關係，至於我個人這樣的看法和分析，是不是正確，還願再作商榷，我是絕沒有成見的。</p>
<p>就此帶住。謝謝諸位讀者的愛護和關心！（卅六·七·十五夜）</p>

<h3>美國的書市</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>美國每月所出的文藝　　，指不勝屈，我們實在無從介紹起，因爲大部分都還是未經時間淘汰的作者和作品。與其談到它們，我寗顧介紹一些最近的文學史，文學理論和文學名著的重版與分析。</p>
<p>西德與華德（Sheed　＆　Ward）書店預備出一套「世界的偉大作家」（Great　Writers　ofthe　World）。每册必有傳記，引證本文（其中有新譯的），這作家所處的時代和他對於將來的影響。已出羅馬「賀拉西」和意大利「濮卡旭」二種，不久將續出「拉勃萊士」「但丁」「莫泊桑」等。</p>
<p>弗洛以德的「達文西」現在已有英譯。「史梯文生選集」計一千二百　，內有長短篇小說散文詩歌等，每篇均無節略。這兩本書都是闌當書屋（Random　House）出版的。</p>
<p>芝加哥大學出版部出版了一本平達（Pindar）短歌的新譯，又出版了一本卡因（Richard　M．Kain）的「虛構的旅人」（Fabulons　Voyager）。後者是專門解釋朱士（James　Joyce）的「優力栖斯」的。我們不要抱「優力栖斯」當作神秘的作品，這只是人生的經騐。有的批許家駡這書是猥褻的，也有人稱讚他的作風，其實都不能眞正了解這一部現代的「神曲」。卡因指出從未指出過的書中的象徵，找出作者實在是在攻擊文明道德的失敗。</p>
<p>考克斯（Sidney　Cox）寫下了一本「迂曲」（Indirecions），這是一本談寫作的書。作者經騐常識，都很豐富，人情透達，文字也深入　出，書出後曾得到一致的好評。諾卜夫（Alfred　A．Knopf）書店出版。</p>
<p>弗雷（Northrop　Frye）寫了一本「可怕的均齊」（Fearful　Symmetry），潑林斯頓大學出版部刋行。這是一本研究勃萊克（WilliamBlake）的專著，可以解答這作者的詩　。作者敍到勃萊克的思想和詩歌，分述他的宗敎觀，人生觀和藝術觀，他詩歌中複雜的象徽，他對於當時英國文學的關係、他的詩歌的眞諦等等。</p>
<p>蓋士勒（John　Gassner）所編的「現代美國劇院最什劇選」（Best　Plays　of</p>
<p>Modern　American　Theatre）又出了第二集，計十七個完全的劇本，首有導言，許敘一九三九年到四六年美國戲劇的發展，每一作家也有傳記和參考資料。</p>
<p>圖書館協會新近出了幾種書：（一）愛瑪生論文集，除聖經與莎士比亞外，古今人士引用愛瑪生語句者最多。（二）聖經佚文，兩卷，五六二面。（三）喬叟的「剛脫保萊故事」，用現代語譯出。（四）朱士的「優力栖斯」，全本未節略。（五）羅藺斯的「第一位査泰萊夫人」，此書即「査泰萊夫人的情人」。（五）莎士比亞全集，連詩與十四行詩在內，共一五二七面，附四十全圖。（六）最值得稱述的是「天方夜譚全譯」，譯者是布爾頓（Burton），附有他的全部註釋和短論。並有全部索引和安吉羅（Valenti　Angelo）一千零一幅揷圖。三卷，售美金十七元四角八分，該The　Union　Library　Association地點在121-123　East　24th　Street，New　York10　N．Y．。</p>
<h3>小品兩題</h3>
<p>— 施濟美</p>
<p>後台</p>
<p>繡幕漸慚的下垂，動人心魂的音樂，在送觀衆們　去。</p>
<p>一齣好戲就這樣的散塲了。</p>
<p>朋友約我去後合參觀，我高興的答應下來。</p>
<p>那雕攔玉砌的樓合，原來就是這些不塊和布片麽？那瑰麗的花木山林，原來就是這些彩紙和粉畫麽？還有那尚未拭去油彩的臉，在化奘間的燈光下，是多麼的難看！剛才，戲台上也打着燈光，又何其美麗而莊嚴？</p>
<p>一切不同了，然而又豈止這些？</p>
<p>你看：，那一雙熱戀的情人，現在正爲着剛才的「搶詞」而拌嘴，爭得面紅耳赤；戲裏的孝子和慈母不知爲了什麼也在賭氣了；好好先生在破口駡人；那個天眞的女孩子却和戲裏搶刦她的強盜在暗送秋波……</p>
<p>——原來這就是後台，多麼的不同啊！</p>
<p>想不到前合那樣美好的，在後合却是如此的醜惡！想不到……</p>
<p>蝴蝶和蜜蜂</p>
<p>你記得？</p>
<p>當鳥語花香的艷陽天，蜜蜂在花間飛舞，蝴蝶也在花間飛舞……</p>
<p>蝴蝶對蜜蜂說：『玩吧，趁着這黃金也似的春時』。</p>
<p>蜜蜂回答道：『正因爲是黃金也似的春時，我不能忘記釀蜜」。</p>
<p>『良辰不久，好景難再，你應該記得及時行樂』。</p>
<p>『良辰不久，好景難再，我只知道及時努力』。</p>
<p>『有一天，春光遠去，你將要悔不當初』。</p>
<p>『有一天，春光遠去，你才要悔不當初』。</p>
<p>眞的有一天：牠們在另外一個世界裏相逢了。</p>
<p>『我虛度了我的靑春』。蜜蜂在悔不當初。</p>
<p>『我浪費了我的靑春』。蝴蝶也在悔不當初。</p>
<p>親愛的，蝴蝶也罷，蜜蜂也罷，任你選擇，任你安排，但是記住，在將來、千萬別悔不當初！千萬別。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　355</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這種「禪功」，當時同級誰都試過，誰都沒有成功。旁人經騐，各自不同；總之，各人一個花樣，各人一套說法。至於我，連試三次，就有兩次大夢一覺，晃眼半日，幾乎把考試和把夜車都躭誤了。</p>
<p>倒是後來担任職務之後，常覺精神不支，偶然憶起這個玩意，下狠心練過一些日子，確然得着些門徑。自與鶴見合作以來，這個方法，竟成了我的不龜手藥，小技大用（？），眞也能够收些效果。也曾把這方法授拾鶴見，據說也有「零碎效騐」。</p>
<p>然而自從針劃動身移植山西，直到進抵昌平，竟忙得六神無主，連這「禪功」都不能按時舉行。所以這天晚上，鼎元和大傻子勸我休息，我也只得接受。可是剛一盍眼，就聽見劉五走來說；「天大亮了，外面來了一位小客，立等會見。」</p>
<p>睜眼一瞧說不是天己大亮？然而我却認爲才一盍眼，可知睡得太甜，竟不覺得時間過得這樣快。</p>
<p>「小客？」一聽就想到必是小老虎；「快請進來！」我忙不迭地對劉五揮着手，自己也一翻身下了床。</p>
<p>「老伯：」小老虎不待劉五出去，早跑進裏屋來了；「老伯，我來哪！」</p>
<p>幾天沒有看見這孩子，就像離別了幾年似的。我細細打量了他一下，覺得他身量似乎又高了些。立刻我又覺得這只是一種意識上的錯覺；因素日一心存念，老是想到他才十二三歲的孩子；孩子當然不能太高—照普通孩子身量—有了這種存想，所以隔了幾天，乍一再見，便覺得他又長高了一些。</p>
<p>他身上穿的，仍舊那一套—短袖敝領襯衫，西式長脚褲，—那襯衫白裏泛黃，黃裏又泛白，大槪這幾天就沒換過，　得厲書。那條長褲，雖說西式，前後就看不出一條直縫輪廓，要不是有幾粒鈕子，兩個插袋和翻起的褲脚，誰也不肯承認那是西裝褲子。</p>
<p>至於脚上那雙鞋，倒有些舊小說裏形容的「密納翻口」，「踢殺牛」的意味。他這雙鞋，雖然密納翻口，確也是一雙倣來路貨的籃球高統靴，因爲歲月久了一些，他跑得路多，綳扯得厲害，那幫統上的穿帶洞洞，都扯過了界，破了，他也懶得再穿上去，以致那統口確也有些翻口式子。那「踼殺　」的話，也有幾分眞實性；因鞋庭鞋尖，早經補過幾次，釘上了老厚的牛皮；那副野蠻樣子，確像能踢殺一隻牛似的。</p>
<p>照說處城目前受過等級，也是一個小小少尉，也應該有一份「請受」，一份口糧，一份配備，何至於這軍用皮鞋都弄不到一鞋？這一問，頗有道理·無亲小老虎自幼生長　北，自來就不考較衣着。再者，他根本不愛皮鞋；「硬幫幫地，滑溜溜地；簡直不吃勁」。記得他初次會見W君的那天晚上，他就穿的一雙新皮鞋。</p>
<p>滬濱絮語</p>
<h3>軍人的抱怨</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>有一次我在電車裏，因爲人擠，碰了一下一位軍人，他像觸了電一樣的，臉漲得通紅，握緊了拳頭，大有對我挑戰的神氣。他身體很結實，說動手，馬上我會喫到他的「皮　頭」，甚至會嘗兩下耳摑子；但我是受過「儒佛」客忍之通的，他雖然再三對我橫眼睛，我爲了免生是非，只得忍氣吞聲，結果總算沒有關下大禍。</p>
<p>事後和人談起，許多人都說「英雄不喫眼前虧」，還是不要和他們吵的好。</p>
<p>又有一次，在公共汽車裏，下車的時候，後面推動得利譽，好像撞了一下前面兩個穿得挺整齊的軍人，他們下車以後，又是一付生氣的臉蛋，其中一位從橫里打量我，好像想偵察我的身份，意思大有大打出手的企圖；那時我在想，身份之類居然可以擋一擋人家的拳頭，這是意想不到的。</p>
<p>有了這兩次敎訓，以後我對軍人特別低聲下氣，因爲他們乾火旺，容易生氣，我雖不敢存心觸犯他們，但偶一疏忽，就作了他們的出氣筒，對於我，實在是一個太大的損失。</p>
<p>但後來平靜心氣想了一想，他們生活上的「抱怨」太多了，不能責備他們的粗魯。尤其是上海這窮奢極侈的環境，對他們無論如何是一種諷嘲，是一種衝動，那些紅燈酒綠，光怪陸離的都市的聲色，對於他們，眞是一種生氣的東西。</p>
<p>何况，他們中間，許多都是飽經血戰的勇士，上海這繁華富麗的洋塲，他們看了怎麽不生氣</p>
<p>正如，雷馬克在「大街」裏所寫的士兵復員歸來，他們心理上不很正常，不很健康，他們對一切都憎恨，對一切都抱怨。</p>
<p>所以，當你們在街車上，碰到他們那些憎恨的眼光，或是怒火中燒的神氣，你是應該百分之百平靜心氣地來應付這個塲面的。</p>

<h3>魏德邁來華軼聞</h3>
<p>— 佳木</p>
<p>在二次世界大戰中，美國駐在東西戰塲的最高級將領，除了麥帥之外，往往是軍事組織家的成份多於戰將的成份，同時也往往是軍人外交家。西方的艾帥是如此，再度來華的魏德邁將軍亦是這一型人物。</p>
<p>魏德邁將軍之有今日的地位，是戰時在中國戰區的一番服務所造成的，但魏將軍之派至中國，邱吉爾有間接的關係，這是一段非常有趣的歷史軼事。</p>
<p>魏德邁曾留學德國，他是德國戰術的專家，馬歇爾內圈的得力人員，本來也是在艾帥總部服務的重要人員之一。在魁北克會議時，羅邱召開高級將領會議，洽商開闢西方戰塲的問題。邱相最初極力反對在法國登陸，說是換失可能太大，並且說英美空軍實力在一九四四年將達到最高峯，只須實行戰略轟炸一年摧毀德國所有的工業城市，戰爭必可結束，但是大量流血的代價却可以避免了。這個意見，羅斯福及馬歇爾等均表反對，結果決定商討開闢第二戰塌的技術問題。邱翁以自己的意見不被採納、堅持如登陸西歐的話，美國需出七成兵力，英國只能出三成，並憤然的說：「我不能浪費英帝國的種子」。當時魏德邁在座，起而反對，他根據「行軍學」的立塲，主張英美登陸兵力的比例，應爲五十對五十，如此第二戰綫可於一九四三年開闢。否則如由美國運大軍至英倫三島，因潛艇活躍，損失重大，再加上休息訓練，戰事的結束將延遲一載。魏氏的意見爲美方人員所贊成，但是　　　時不肯讓步。最後羅斯福　　　　顧全英美盟誼起見，接受了英方的意見。從此以後，邱翁對魏德邁頗存戒懼之心，認爲有這樣一個人在西歐總部，對於英帝國的利益頗有妨碍。因此，他選擇了一個極爲適當的機會，向羅斯福巧妙的建議把魏德邁派赴蒙巴頓總部任副參謀長。邱翁的本意是：東南亞戰區主要是海空戰，而魏氏是德國戰術專家，派他到這裏，可以使他英雄無用武之地，而不致牽制蒙巴頓的行動。但是，天下的事變化太多，不可預斷，史迪威　一走，因馬歇爾的提薦，魏德邁就憑他少年時代曾在華服務及有外交能力的雙重關係，竟派到中國來負獨當一面的重任了。</p>
<p>戰時和戰後魏德邁的貢戲，盡人皆知，這裏略舉一兩件小事，可以看出他應付人事的能力。他一到中國，即一反史迪威崛强之態，力謀和我國當局建立友誼，每次謁主席晤談之時，口吻語氣終是以中國參謀長自居，而不以美軍總司令自居。據聞他有向主席建議，除詳陳理由，希望採行外並謙遜的說：「你如果作相反的決定，我亦一定服從」。這種良好的態度顧全了一國元首的自尊心，而使一切事件易於推動。蔣主席是紫不參加外國人士的私人招待的，但是魏將軍在陪都時，居然使主席破例的參加他的夜餐招待，這點他一再對外表示是私人的英大光榮。他對於中國人民和領袖，具有高度的同情。勝利前夕曾撰文在美國柯里雜誌發表，客觀的指出中國的困難及克服之道，並代我國向外界解釋不應有的誤會。他對於我國軍需制度極不滿意，主張在大反攻時由美軍官爲中國辦補給，但同時對於陳誠，兪大維，林可勝等的廉能和努力，亦大加讚揚，希望美國對中國的批評，不要抹煞一切。這些小動作，累積起來，對中美友誼是頗有貢獻的。</p>
<p>這裏引一位外交界人士的話，來結束本文：「馬歇爾的在華工作，需要有人來收拾結束，軍火與援軍僅是一個信號，現在終由魏德邁來收拾。美國在遠東，戰略指導外交，在馬歇爾身上，戰略和外交是融爲一體，而魏德邁事實上是馬歇爾的代表。」</p>
<h3>縮小印術</h3>
<p>— 安遠</p>
<p>廿四巨册的大英百科全書，祗有二英寸厚。</p>
<p>哈佛圖書館的全部藏書，可在冷僻的小地方看到。</p>
<p>美國科學家若需要各種書籍的時候，可以免費向政府去領取，不論它是何種文字。這是任何喜歡研究科學而買不到書籍的人所羡慕的，但是當你看到他們所領的書籍，一定要大大地奇罕，因爲並不是普通的書，而是薦紙訂成的集子，看起來好似顏料樣本，密排着許多黑色的長方塊，原洧二萬七千頁的大英百科全書，祗有二英寸厚一册，那時你心裏定有「這也算書嗎」的感想，不要奇怪！這正是帮助戰事美國科學特別發達的一個重要因素——縮小印術。</p>
<p>縮小印術是美國出版　邦訥（Albert　Boni）化了五年功夫才發明的，他所印的醫，每頁要許多長四分之三英寸，寬半寸的長方黑塊，每一黑塊就相當普通書一頁。爲了適應　這種書，他又發明了一種名爲Readea的讀書機，其外型好似打字機，在讀書機上讀縮小的書，眞是便當極了，祇要拉出機身底部的狹抽斗，把書插入，然後旋轉機鈕，開亮機內的燈光，把焦點校正，於是你能在頂部透明片上，見到與普通一樣大小的書，你祗要一舉手，便可把書一頁一頁地翻過去，或十頁百頁地翻過去。</p>
<p>這讀書機約健一百二十元美金，是讀縮小書本中最大的費用，以後你祇要化五分錢的代價，買到一本百科全書，化極少的代價，能買到希臘和羅爲的全册古典文學，而市塲上祇有它的斷片節末。律師，工程師，醫師，學者及專門技師，可以不必上圖書館，而能在案頭看到罕有而珍貴的著作。世界最大的哈佛圖書館，差不多藏有世界上全部知識，利用縮小印術，這許多書可出現於每個冷僻的小鎭上。所以用過縮小書本的人，都異口同心地讚美這是印刷上最大的發明。</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>美國的榮譽軍人</p>
<p>有國加就有戰爭，有戰爭就有傷兵，不，應該說是榮譽軍人，榮譽軍人抗戰有功，宜乎受社會的優待，但社會是冷酷的，人情是勢利的，榮譽軍人已成爲沒有武器的兵，斷了一條腿，撑了拐杖挨戶募捐，甚至吿地狀，抑復何榮譽之有？美國榮譽軍人的遭遇就不同了，陣亡是恤金一萬元，殘廢的另有議恤，未受傷或已治愈的退役歸來，除受當地民衆隆盛歡迎外，政府規定了幾項辦法，願意就學者不論其已往階級，一律每月津貼學雜費五十元，願意辦農塲工廠的，祇須擬具詳細計劃，由政府貸與開辦費，數額無限，欲置不動產者製就圖樣，準備百分之五的現款，其餘百分之九十五，槪由數府祖保向銀行借貸，付極低利息，願往海外求學者，可列爲交換學生，遺派出國，不願退役者，可再服役三年，政麻這樣優待榮譽軍人，誰不忠勇愛國，準備第三次世界大戰時再來一次壯烈的鏡頭？政府以國士待之，士卒以國十報之，所以在美軍中極少開小差的，你想當一名起碼小兵，有五十元底薪，二十五元家屬津貼，第一個小孩津貼三十元，第二第三個小孩各津貼三十元，再加飯貼，房貼，海外津貼，年資津貼，一個月要支二百多美金，那里去找這樣優厚的位置？當一名榮譽軍人，最低限度要衣食足，美國的兵精而不多，訓練成一名可以作戰的兵，單就子彈一項而言，就得化上三萬發，再加上裝備和訓練期內的一切費用，一名小兵的身價當在十萬美金左右，這五十元一　月的待遇，已算是微乎其微的了，一萬美金的撫恤也不過是一份薄賻。（二五）</p>
<h3>福王的「老神仙主義」　一亂世懷古錄之二</h3>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>吳梅村在「鹿椎記聞」中有幾句話論及在南京登極的福王（也就是當時的弘光帝）：</p>
<p>「世或言福王讀書少，未能親決章奏，故內閹外壬得相倚爲奸；其平居飲食宴樂時，或狂走宮苑，如失心狀；至如孌童季女，方藥縱慾，皆傳聞之過。此言或然。要之，漢阿斗之類也。即史（可法）高（宏圖）諸公在朝，尤難輔之；况乎馬（士英）阮（大鋮）乎？」</p>
<p>乙已除夕，福王居興寗宮，愀然大樂，太監韓贊周進日：「新宮宜歡，而皇上如有所慊，得母念皇考乎？」福王不應，旣而日：「梨園殊少佳者」。而在這時候以前，南京已有「中書隨地有，都督滿街走，監紀多如羊，職方賤如狗。蔭起千年塵，拔貢一呈首，掃盡江南綫，塡塞馬家口」之謠。一方面有淸兵進逼，四鎭內鬨，左良玉屯兵江左，與馬士英國爭不已，再加上江南大旱，數月不雨，正人君子如高安圖等皆已罷政，觸目是一片亡國氣象，然而另一方面是「相公只愛錢，皇帝但吃酒。」更有甚者，「大學士高宏圖罷，馬士英代爲首輔，福王拱手聽之、深居禁中，惟以演雜劇，飲火酒，淫幼女爲樂。民間稱之曰老神仙。」而霸王又信仰得那麼澈底，以至在大除夕那天，還有點「愀然不樂」，留下了那句旣幽默而又有風趣的佳話：「梨園殊少佳者。</p>
<p>吳梅村說福王是個劉阿斗，庸懦是實，方藝縱慾云云，則是傳聞太過了，可是歷史上就紀有科臣陳子龍的疏言：</p>
<p>「近日中使四出，民間女子稍有姿色，即以黃紙貼額，選入宮中，閭里騷然，請行禁止。」</p>
<p>當清軍已破毫州，多爾袞率兵至淮安，時局日益緊急了。可是南都還在爲彙選淑女而大忙特</p>
<p>「七十人中選中阮姓一女，大鋮姪女也。又，送到浙中淑女五十名，選中王姓一名，周姓一名，俱送皇監。」</p>
<p>在這樣的年頭，不料大司馬阮大鋮還想做國丈呢。雖然這是臣下阿諛取寵的手段之一，而福主在砲火聲中對「淫幼女」一事頗有興趣，也該不是「傳聞失實」吧？</p>
<p>使福王敢於面對淸兵而無動於衷的，還是他的「老神仙主義」。——演雜劇，飲火酒，淫幼女，畢竟比辦理朝政有趣多了。</p>
<p>可是好景不長，終於發生了僞太子案，福王自然比誰都着急，於是將僞太子遷移南京下獄，必欲置之死地！不然的話，「將何以處朕？」江山在清兵刀下，已只這麽一點，不堪分家，也不願再分了，而况若對方果是太子，自己就只好讓位，能够分家還是大幸。所以，在其他政爭上，「但愛吃酒」，不免糊塗。自有他的「老神仙主義」，到了爭奪皇位這一生死關頭、他顯得很精明，變成一個道地的入世者了。他之害怕眞有個太子突然出現，情形跟宋室南渡後高宗不欲　　二帝南還相彷彿。</p>
<p>可是雖然戰戰兢兢地做了幾年「但愛吃酒」的皇帝，在馬士英阮大鋮之流的扶掖下，也畢竟還能一嘗「國朝」降主的生活况味。被俘後爲多爾袞拷問了一塲，　後也就寂寞以終，看來，這是因爲失去了生活條件，他就　法堅持他的「老神仙主義」之　吧？</p>
<h3>世界末日的幻景</h3>
<p>— 彬之</p>
<p>兩年前，第一顆原子彈在廣島降落，顯出了莫大的威力。科學家們紛紛地討論它的後果；尤其是許多天文學家憂慮它會妨碍地球的安全，而使世界趨於毀減。這一幕世界末日的幻景是怎樣呢？他們的想像中，有一天太陽系會被原子能破壤，地球就發生劇烈的變化。在高熱度中火化了，被冰塊寒流包園而凍結了，再或是與其他星球失去平衡的力量，發生混亂撞擊，將地球毀滅了。</p>
<p>火是破壞力最大的，戰後的慘象，多半是火的表現。地球可能就毀滅在火神的暴力下。太陽受了原子能的影響，因內部變化而體積慢慢地擴大。會比現在的太陽大三倍，熱力也增强了，地球上的溫度，也升到能够使金屬熔解的一點，一切的東西在高熱的煎熬下，由熔化而趨於消滅。</p>
<p>殞石的火力，也會毀滅地球的可能。過去雖曾有過殞石，但並不十分地嚴重。原子能也許可使殞石的體積加大，火力增强，而落在像紐約一般的市區中。數百萬的人口，無數的建築物，以及一切的東西，都處於火燄包圍中，片刻之問都化爲灰燼了。若是殞石有好幾塊同時落在幾處的大都市裏，世界不是就要這樣地毀滅了嗎？</p>
<p>火力雖具有無上的威力，但地球上也不能片刻沒有火，假使在原子能的震盪·使地球越出了軌道，離開得太陽稍遠些。那時地球就因得不到太陽的溫情，而被冰川寒流所包圍，要比現在的北極或南極還要冷幾倍。一切的東西被凍結了，僵斃了，地球也就由消沉而毀滅。</p>
<p>太陽系被破壤以後，許多行星却沒有軌道可以遵循了，於是在宇宙的太空中無目的地飛馳。假使一個比地球更大的屋球飛近地球時，地球上的人類，物件，凡一切可搬動的東西，都會受那星球的吸引，白日飛昇，在天空中亂舞着。這不是仙界的幻景，而是慘劇的前奏曲。他們在半天中撞擊，破壞，終而趨於毀滅。</p>
<p>假使是一個比地球較小的星球臨近時，也有可怕的事端發生。譬如月球侵入到地球周圍八千哩之內，月球就會受地球的吸力而分裂。這無數的碎塊落到地面時，地球上的一切也就被破壞了。剩下的盡是些月球的碎塊，像一個個新的月球·</p>
<p>天文學家的話可怕嗎？可慘嗎？但是否會有這一幕，看將來的事實罷。（圖示世界末日之一景）</p>

<h3>Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan: Chairman Approves and Orders Implementation; Economic Council Revises and Passes Reform Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Tokyo Dispatch, 21st] Our nation's first five-year plan for economic recovery after the war has been drafted. Based on pre-war values, it is estimated to require funds of 21,937,000,000 yuan and the involvement of 4,968,093 personnel. The plan has been approved by Chairman Chiang, who has instructed the National Economic Council to adopt and implement it.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The economic reform proposal was revised and passed by the National Economic Council at its eighth meeting on the 21st and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for onward presentation. It awaits review and approval by the State Council, and implementation measures will be drafted for its execution. This economic reform proposal, which has garnered widespread attention, consists of fifteen chapters, totaling over 5,000 words. After multiple discussions and comprehensive reviews, it was finally passed today. The political sections have been entirely removed, and both in terms of content and style, it is much more thorough than the original draft. It can be described as the culmination of the efforts of national economic experts. The proposal is divided into three main parts: the first is a preface, briefly describing the current economic crisis and the areas where efforts should be focused on finance, production, and fiscal policy, with particular attention to revitalizing agriculture, stabilizing prices, and currency value. The second part is the proposal itself, divided into three sections: A, Finance, comprising thirteen items including banking; B, Production and Construction, including: (1) Agriculture, divided into four items, (2) Industry, divided into fourteen items, (3) Commerce, five items, (4) Transportation, eight items, (5) Increasing production of goods and stabilizing prices, eight items; C, Fiscal Policy, divided into: (1) Reorganizing public finance, with nine sub-items, (2) Stabilizing currency value. The final part is the conclusion. During today's discussion of the proposal, the most significant amendment concerned the import-export linkage system. Some committee members felt that the amount should not be specified, while others argued that it should be. Ultimately, it was decided to designate certain goods for implementation of the import-export linkage system. Additionally, the issue of requisitioning overseas deposits of Chinese citizens was raised. (3) Items originally under the commerce section have been moved under currency value stabilization. The committee also discussed the issue of foreign investment in China. Members offered valuable suggestions, and some were appointed to review them. Today's meeting began at 3 PM and adjourned at approximately 7 PM. Chairman Chen Lifu and committee members He Haoruo, Shi Kuiling, Yu Hongjun, Pan Xulun, Deng Feihuang, Yu Feipeng, Zuo Shunsheng, Wang Xiaolai, Qi Tongsun, Huang Yuanbin, Xue Dubi, Liu Jianqun, Chen Qitian, Weng Wenhao, and others were present.</p>
<p>Content of the Proposal Preface</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The preface to the economic reform proposal elaborates in great detail on the efforts that should be made in the future regarding finance, production, and fiscal policy. It states that the current economic crisis is becoming increasingly severe and that the root causes should be explored for reform. Based on the factors of production, namely land, capital, and labor, rural areas lack only capital. How financial institutions themselves can be strengthened and enriched, and how their funds can be properly coordinated with land and labor to achieve rural prosperity, increase farmers' purchasing power, and lay the foundation for and develop the domestic light industry. As for the operations of various banks, there should be a clear division of labor, each with its own specialty and mission, mutually contributing to economic development. This is what urgently needs reform in the financial sector. Secondly, how to transform an agricultural country into an industrialized one is the most important task for national construction in the future. How to use state capital to guide the flexible use of private capital, with state-owned enterprises undertaking difficult tasks and assisting private enterprises in easier ones, and welcoming foreign capital and technical personnel to achieve industrialization, is what needs reform in production and construction. Furthermore, fiscal policy should start with the development of various productive industries to increase the proportion of income. How to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, improve the collection policy, and make the fiscal foundation grow thicker with the development of various productive industries, using tens of billions of yuan in production capacity and its total income to support the entire country's finances.</p>
<p>Another important section of the proposal is the conclusion, which points out that financial policy, economic policy, and fiscal policy are mutually causal and complementary. The matters described in this proposal that are being implemented by the government but have not yet taken effect should be strengthened by the responsible departments, and those awaiting implementation should be formulated into detailed plans. Three points should be noted: (1) Reasonably resolve the issues of compensation for officials, soldiers, civil servants, and workers to ensure they can maintain a minimum necessary standard of living, thereby improving administrative efficiency. (2) State-owned enterprises and private enterprises should be placed on an equal footing. (3) A broad economic construction movement should be launched in society to increase public understanding and interest in the economy.</p>
<h3>Our Traders Should Form a Japan-Trade Company; Remarks by the Deputy Head of the Economic Section of the Delegation to Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] As Japan's external trade recovery approaches, Lin Siyi, Deputy Head of the Economic Section of our Delegation to Japan, urges domestic traders to promptly establish import-export trade companies targeting Japan. Mr. Lin emphasized that the Far Eastern Commission is currently allowing Japan to resume foreign trade, and what is being encouraged is private trade, not government trade. He continued, "Of the 400 trade representatives, China will have 64." According to Mr. Lin, before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, Japan's foreign trade is still under the control of the Allied Headquarters. Traders coming to Japan must be approved by the Allied Headquarters. Foreign traders in Japan can directly contact Japanese traders, but any commercial contract must be approved by the Allied Headquarters before it can be concluded. For example, if a Chinese trader and a Japanese trader agree to enter into a contract, the Chinese trader should report this to the Chinese Delegation to Japan for submission to the Allied Headquarters for approval. Mr. Lin stated that all prices are set by the Allied Headquarters according to world market prices, and all transactions are calculated in US dollars. Exported goods will be divided into two categories: one is government trade, and the other is private trade. Raw silk, cotton textiles, and tea belong to government trade. Goods can be picked up locally or in China. In the former case, Chinese traders are responsible for freight, while in the latter case, the Allied Headquarters and the Japanese side assist with freight. Mr. Lin continued that methods will be established to allow Chinese traders to use Chinese ships. When asked whether overseas Chinese in Japan can engage in import-export trade between China and Japan, Mr. Lin replied that it requires the approval of the Chinese government. Mr. Lin further explained that Chinese traders who wish to trade in Japan must first apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval, and then the Ministry of Economic Affairs will send a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the Chinese Delegation to Japan to apply to the Allied Headquarters for the trader's exit permit. Mr. Lin also announced that our country will soon send a trade delegation to Japan. (The "Legislators Xiao Zheng and Huang Yuanbin Discuss Opening Trade with Japan" reported on page two of yesterday's newspaper. Note that Xiao Zheng is a member of the National Economic Council, not a legislator. This correction is attached.)</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Japanese Reparation Ships: Some to Be Equipped Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] According to the military news agency, some of the first batch of eight Japanese reparation ships currently in Shanghai will soon be equipped with weapons and begin service.</p>
<h3>Chairman Plans to Run for National Assembly Delegate in Fenghua</h3>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 21st] The election of legislators and National Assembly delegates will be held as scheduled by the government, and preparations for the election are in full swing throughout the country. It is learned that Chairman Chiang also plans to run for National Assembly delegate in his hometown of Fenghua. Because the county's election candidates have high hopes of being elected, there are many participants, including Yu Feipeng, Liu Zuhan, and Mao Qing. It is rumored that Chiang Ching-kuo is also willing to participate in the election. Sun Yici of the county has given up district elections and is participating in the National Assembly election for the free professional journalism sector.</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui Speaks: Plans to Request Funds to Resettle Northeast Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Government member Mo Dehui told reporters: "This entire matter regarding the Volunteer Army has brought me to Shanghai, and I plan to return to Nanjing on the 23rd. Regarding the resettlement of the Volunteer Army after their return to their hometowns, I plan to request 1 billion circulation coupons from the central government as resettlement funds. After they return to the Northeast, most will engage in military reclamation, some will enter factories, and the old, weak, and disabled will be provided with relief and accommodation. Every effort will be made to prevent them from becoming displaced. The state's preferential treatment of this group of soldiers who were the first to resist Japan will naturally benefit future resistance against foreign aggression. The Northeast has now become a flashpoint in the world, and its future development is related to the safety of the world. The Northwest is also our country's border, and its importance cannot be separated from that of the Northeast. General Wedemeyer's visit to China will enhance Sino-American friendship. China's current situation requires either the United States and the Soviet Union to withdraw together and allow China to decide its own future, or the United States to support our country in dealing with the expansion of communism. One of these two must be the case." When asked whether the rumor that Zhang Xueliang was at Mogan Mountain was reliable, Mr. Mo replied, "Zhang Xueliang has not left Taiwan."</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Still in Taiwan: Recently Sent a Letter to His Brother Zhang Xueming</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 21st] Sources in the know say that Zhang Xueliang is still in Taiwan and the rumor of him flying to Zhejiang is not true. Zhang recently sent a letter to his brother Zhang Xueming, saying that the Northeast has been lost for too long, and it is not necessary to ask the Disposal Bureau to return old properties. Zhang Xueming is currently the Chief Advisor of the Northeast Security Commander Department and has come to Beiping on business. Before General Chen left Beiping, he summoned him for a meeting.</p>
<h3>Li Zongren Flies to Nanjing; Ma Hongkui Visits Qin Dechun and Others</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 21st] Li Zongren left Beiping by plane at around 11 AM on the 21st to attend an important meeting. Sun Lianzhong flew back to Baoding on the morning of the 21st.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 21st] Commander-in-Chief of the Army Gu Zhutong flew back to Xuzhou from Nanjing by plane on the afternoon of the 20th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] According to the military news agency, Ma Hongda, Deputy Director of the Northwest Headquarters, visited Qin Dechun, Vice Minister of National Defense, Huang Zhenqiu, Vice Minister, and Liu Shiyi, Vice Minister, on the morning of the 21st to discuss the situation in the Northwest.</p>
<h3>Batch of Soviet Nationals in Beiping to Evacuate Before Month's End</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 21st] A batch of 185 Soviet nationals in Beiping will evacuate from the city before the end of the month and return to their country via Tianjin. The list has been handed over to the Soviet Consul General in Beiping, Ledovsky, who will also return to his country. During his absence, the position of Consul General may be temporarily filled by Secretary Tsikheven.</p>
<h3>President Roxas Reiterates: Welcomes Chairman Chiang to Visit the Philippines</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 21st] It is confirmed that Philippine President Roxas sincerely hopes that Chairman Chiang will take the time to visit the Philippines for a short stay. It is said that Mr. Roxas has expressed this wish to our Minister to the Philippines, Chen Zhiping, several times. On the 8th of this month, when Minister Chen discussed general diplomatic relations between China and the Philippines with Mr. Roxas, Mr. Roxas once again asked Minister Chen to convey to Chairman Chiang his hope that he would visit the Philippines and give the Filipino people the opportunity to admire the great leader of China. Minister Chen expressed his gratitude for Mr. Roxas's kindness and promised to convey it to the Chairman upon his return to Nanjing, and hoped that Mr. Roxas could also find time to visit China.</p>
<h3>Popular Armed Forces Create Peace in Chahar, Suiyuan, and Northern Shanxi; Fu Zuoyi Speaks to Our Reporter</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Fu Zuoyi, Director of the Zhangjiakou Pacification Headquarters, met with our reporter on the morning of the 21st. According to him, Chahar, Suiyuan, and northern Shanxi are generally peaceful at present. This peace is created by the people's armed forces. For example, a village eight kilometers from Yongning recently used its self-defense force of more than twenty rifles to fight against 1,200 communist bandits, sixty times their number, for more than four hours. After the national army arrived, they finally eliminated the communist bandits. If the people receive support from the government, they will devote themselves to defending their hometowns, and the communist bandits will have no place to survive. Chahar Province had a good wheat harvest this year, and military and civilian food supplies are generally not a concern. As for the issue of the grain department's requisitioning, Chahar Province, due to the large price difference, adopts the principle of purchasing surplus grain and does not use quota purchases to avoid unfair burdens on small and medium-sized farmers and embezzlement by unscrupulous elements. Chahar Province's industry and commerce have been severely damaged by the communist army and are difficult to restore, but they are now much better than before August and September. Regarding the invasion of Suiyuan by Mongolian troops, Mr. Fu said, "I have heard nothing about it," but he did not deny the possibility. Regarding whether the border defense forces can cope with emergencies in the future, he said that from the current point of view, this does not seem to be a major concern. As for the future, military changes are very rapid and cannot be predicted. Mr. Fu is as robust as ever, and his conversation shows that he is quite optimistic about the future of the provinces in Inner Mongolia. It is reported that this trip to Nanjing is to discuss and seek instructions on some business matters and that he will return to his defense post soon.</p>
<h3>Qinghai Provincial Assembly Members Support Mobilization to Suppress Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Our Xining Dispatch, 20th] The Qinghai Provincial Assembly, representing two million people, met on July 18, deeply hating the communist bandits' treason, and resolved to send a telegram to Chairman Chiang, expressing support for the National General Mobilization Order. The telegram stated: "The Communist Party, relying on foreign forces, has launched large-scale rebellions everywhere, seized cities, and massacred people. Wherever they go, towns and villages are left in ruins. Negotiations have already failed, and the people are trapped in fire and water. Fortunately, Your Excellency has complied with the people's wishes and resolutely suppressed the rebellion, which is an opportunity for our country to turn danger into safety. This assembly unanimously supports it and represents the two million people of this province, vowing to be the rearguard."</p>
<h3>Telecommunications Review Meeting Held at the Ministry of Communications Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Ministry of Communications' telecommunications review meeting was held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Communications on the morning of the 21st, with the Telecommunications Administration reporting on its business situation for the past six months.</p>
<h3>Peng Xuepei Tours Qinghai</h3>
<p>[Our Xining Dispatch, 20th] Peng Xuepei arrived in Qinghai at 7 PM on the 18th, and Chairman Ma and others went to greet him. Mr. Peng will visit Ta'er Monastery and the sea in Qinghai, and will return to Lanzhou on the 21st and then go to Xinjiang. Mr. Peng told reporters that his visit to Qinghai was of a tourist nature and that he had no mission. After the launch of the general mobilization, the results of the suppression of the bandits will surely be brilliantly completed.</p>
<h3>Cultural Circles' Rebellion Suppression Conference to Be Established in Nanjing Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] To respond to the national general mobilization, the cultural circles in the capital have launched the organization of the Chinese Cultural Circles' Rebellion Suppression and National Salvation Movement Conference, which is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at 3 PM on the 22nd. Cultural workers from news, art, music, literature, education publishing, academic groups, drama, film, and other fields have been invited to participate in large numbers.

<p>[United Press, Nanjing, Twenty-first] Foreign observers hope that Wedemeyer's visit will end the ambiguous policy implemented by the United States after the end of Marshall's mission to China. No one in the capital can predict the true nature of the Wedemeyer delegation. Its so-called "fact-finding" mission is considered a vague term. Well-informed sources say that the dispatch of this delegation with such high authority is unlikely to be merely for "finding facts."</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Planning to Strengthen Local Armed Forces in Rehe Province</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 21st] Liu Duoquan, Chairman of Rehe Province, came to Beiping a few days ago for treatment of chronic hemorrhoids and will not leave Beiping in the short term. Liu told reporters today that he had asked General Chen to instruct on strengthening local armed forces. When the Chairman first came to Beiping, he approved the establishment of five security battalions in Rehe Province. Due to funding issues, the number of battalions established is insufficient, the equipment is poor, and it is difficult to cooperate with the national army in combat. General Chen has promised to comprehensively plan and improve the situation after arriving in Nanjing. Western Rehe has been generally peaceful recently, but the military strength is still weak. Due to military relations, public administration is difficult to promote. This year's budget for Rehe Province is 17.2 billion, of which 4 billion is raised by the province itself. The communist bandits in Rehe have five infantry brigades, one cavalry brigade, six independent regiments, and twelve county detachments. If the national army had three armies, they could be completely annihilated.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 21st] According to intelligence obtained by Rehe officials, more than 100 cars driven by nationals of a certain country are frequently traveling between Chifeng and Yebaishou to transport supplies for the communist army. The relevant authorities have reported this matter to General Chen in Beiping.</p>

<h3>The US Is Intensifying Research on Using Molybdenum Instead of Tungsten; May Affect Our Country's Tungsten Ore Exports</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 20th] The US "Business Week" reported that molybdenum is now being fully utilized as an important substitute for tungsten in high-speed tools in the US steel industry. Of all metals other than tungsten, molybdenum produces the greatest power at high temperatures, but tungsten is more expensive than molybdenum, and its importance is twice that of the latter, and there are limitations in size and shape. Currently, Westinghouse Electric Corporation in the United States is intensifying its research and development of peacetime uses for molybdenum. From China's perspective, the improvement of molybdenum may severely hit its exports of tungsten to the United States, as China is the world's largest supplier of tungsten and the United States is the largest consumer of tungsten.</p>

<h3>General Election Office Completes National Election Budget of 90 Billion, Submitted to National Government for Approval</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The national election expenses have been budgeted by the General Election Office and submitted to the National Government for approval, along with a request for instructions on the source of funds for subsequent payments. The total cost is estimated at 90 billion yuan. According to the principles for raising election funds established by the General Election Office in 1946, each province and municipality should primarily raise its own funds, supplemented by central government subsidies. However, since the elections for the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan are being held simultaneously this year, the costs are enormous. The central government is currently carefully considering the principles for allocating funds. Before the full budget is approved and announced, the election expenses for each province, municipality, county, and district will be temporarily advanced by the local governments. The budget will be announced after it is finalized.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Regarding the handling of election fraud cases, a spokesperson for the General Election Office told reporters on the 21st: Detailed regulations for handling election law violations are clearly stipulated in our country's criminal law. If a lawsuit is filed during the election period, it should be processed according to legal procedures. However, with regard to election fraud cases, the courts may expedite the processing, and since the circumstances of such lawsuits are often simple, judgments are easier to make. Furthermore, the re-elections after judgments have a definite deadline. The re-election for National Assembly representatives should be held within fifteen days of the judgment, and the re-election for Legislative Yuan members should not exceed thirty days after the judgment is finalized. Therefore, due to the time constraints, unless the courts expedite the trials, the election results will not be completed. As for those who resume campaigning through improper means or illegal actions, the Legislative Yuan has also decided on handling measures. Except for cases that are resolved by the courts due to litigation, all other circumstances will be strictly prohibited and suppressed by the governments of each election district.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to Wang Shi Zeng, a standing committee member of the China Youth Party, proportional representation was proposed by the Democratic Socialist Party, and the China Youth Party expresses its agreement with this. The results of negotiations with the government have already been achieved and will be announced within days. The China Youth Party's candidates for National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members have been largely finalized internally. The China Youth Party has always advocated for participation in local governments, but the negotiations are not as fruitful as reported by the outside world and are still in the negotiation stage. Furthermore, the China Youth Party is scheduled to hold a national congress next month, also in Shanghai. Wang denied the external reports that party members participating in the government cannot inquire about party affairs.</p>
<h3>Li Wei Guo Reports on KMT Propaganda Plan at Weekly Memorial Service: Mobilizing National Strength is the Only Way to Achieve Great Results</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Kuomintang (KMT) Central Headquarters held the weekly memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM on the 21st in the headquarters' auditorium. After Committee Member Zou and Chairman Lu performed the rituals, the newly appointed Minister of Propaganda, Li Wei Guo, was invited to report. Li said that since he had only been in office for less than a week and was not yet fully familiar with the work of the ministry, he would first present a report on the propaganda plan drafted according to the instructions of the Director-General (Chiang Kai-shek). The draft plan will be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for discussion. According to Li's report, in his personal view, the KMT's propaganda work should adhere to the following principles: (1) Propaganda cannot be divorced from the environment, especially the international environment; (2) Propaganda is equivalent to combat, so it is necessary to take the initiative, use offense as defense, and have both advances and retreats; (3) Propaganda is a kind of psychological warfare, so winning hearts is paramount, persuasion is paramount, and truth and facts come first; (4) The KMT is a grand political party, and its propaganda should have the grandeur of a grand political party. Regarding propaganda policy, in a passive aspect, we must protect the freedom of speech in society. In an active aspect, we must pay attention to the following points: (1) The propaganda of doctrine and theory must be adapted to the times; (2) To establish the foundation of the country, there must be a sound basis of public opinion; (3) For the country to be prosperous and happy, the Principle of People's Livelihood must be implemented. Other good measures for general mobilization and various agencies should also be widely promoted. As for propaganda techniques, the most important are unified command and close cooperation among various agencies. At the same time, propaganda must be carried out through organizations and the strength of the whole country should be mobilized in order to achieve great results. Finally, Li explained his hopes after arriving at the ministry, saying: I hope that the work of the Ministry of Propaganda can be pragmatic, that propagandists can be as "vigorous as dragons and tigers," and that our party can be "vibrant and colorful."</p>

<h3>After Feng Qing Ship Runs Aground: 30 Injured, 2 Dead</h3>
<p>Shipping Company Denies Exceeding Passenger Limit</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th] The Feng Qing, a 6,167-ton passenger and cargo ship of the Gang He Feng Company, which sailed from Hong Kong to Shantou on the 18th, ran aground near Zhi Ling Jiao in Mirs Bay (22.39N, 115.34E) en route. The ship's hull was severed. Fortunately, the 1,800 passengers were rescued by ships that came to their aid and returned to Hong Kong. Only 30 people were injured and 2 died. The ships that came to their aid included the American ships Hawkins and Fox, the British ship Hartal, the Chinese ship Shan Xi, the Soviet ship Nomid, the British ship Hunan, and rescue tugboats.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 21st] One hundred of the passengers of the Feng Qing, who were rescued and returned to Hong Kong, were transported back to Shantou on the Wan Fu Shi ship on the 21st. The remaining passengers are still staying in relief shelters, awaiting transport back to Shantou and Xiamen. It is reported that some of the passengers rescued by another ship had not yet arrived in Hong Kong by the morning of the 21st.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 21st] The He Feng Shipping Company told the Central News Agency reporter today that the company's passenger ship Yu Qing, which was sailing between Hong Kong and Shantou, sank. All 1,800 passengers were rescued. The company's only remaining ship, Feng Xiang, will still sail to Hong Kong tomorrow as scheduled. Approximately one thousand passengers have registered for the ship so far, which is much lower than usual. This may be due to the accident in Hong Kong. Today, company officials met with the Central News Agency reporter and denied the Associated Press report that the Feng Qing was only approved to carry one thousand and fifty passengers. They said that the ship's license allowed it to carry 2,400 passengers. They also said that the sinking of the Feng Qing was the company's greatest loss. He Feng is the only shipping company purely capitalized by Chinese investors. It used to have five ships. Strangely, the Feng Mo and Feng Ming ships also sank in the same location as the Feng Qing. The Feng Ping ship sank in the Indian Ocean during this war. The company estimates that the Feng Qing and Feng Xiang ships had a turnover of nearly ten million US dollars in the past two years.</p>

<p>(3) If the number of seats in cinemas, theaters, and amusement venues in various places is insufficient to meet the demand of the number of local stationed troops and veterans, the local public security authorities shall consult with the relevant military unit heads and the persons in charge of the cinemas and amusement venues to formulate a rotating viewing plan and announce it for implementation.</p>

<h3>Zhao Shuhua, a Woman from the Old Capital, Arrested for Using an Alias to Defraud, Fabricating a Company Name to Recruit Employees, Advertising Extensively and Illegally Collecting Application Fees</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] The Beiping Garrison Command arrested a woman on the 19th who flaunted her wealth and used the alias Xu Liyuan to recruit employees in the name of "Fuzhong Company" and defraud them of application fees. Although the amount defrauded was only 2 million yuan, more than 600 people were deceived. This woman's real name is Zhao Shuhua, 30 years old. Before the Anti-Japanese War, she graduated from Beiman Girls' High School. In 1939, she worked undercover for the Military Statistics Bureau in Beiping. In the spring of 1940, she was imprisoned by the Japanese military police for one year and two months. Her husband, Yu, was a colonel and chief of staff in a certain garrison district in Guizhou. He is now in his hometown of Heishan County, Northeast China. They separated during the Anti-Japanese War. In Beiping, she had no means of living and had cohabited with seven men. Recently, she cohabited with a man named Zhang. They often sold everything they owned. Recently, Yu sent a letter asking her to quickly return to her hometown in Northeast China with her twelve-year-old daughter. Because she had no money for the trip, she devised a plan to defraud money. She continuously placed advertisements in various newspapers, fabricating "Fuzhong Company" to recruit employees at all levels, publishing attractive salary figures. Until the day of her arrest, applicants were still flocking to her, each charged 3,000 yuan. Before the incident, she had held an examination once in the two humble rooms where she lived and was discovered to have loopholes. She claimed to be the personnel director of "Fuzhong Company." When applicants raised questions, she would order her lover, Zhang, to entertain them, while she claimed to go to the manager's house of a certain company to discuss funds, taking a pre-arranged car and driving around outside to show off her wealth and make it seem real. She also claimed that this company was related to the Joint Logistics Headquarters, with the head office in Tianjin and a branch in Haidian, a western suburb of Beiping, in order to collect enough application fees to secretly return to her hometown in Northeast China, leaving her lover behind. Later, she was recognized and arrested by the Baojia chief. At first, she stubbornly refused to confess, but later, because her statements were full of loopholes, she wrote a long confession of thousands of words, fluent and coherent, in one stroke. The main idea was: Because she wanted to return home and see her husband, she tried every means to raise travel expenses but could not. She borrowed the name of recruiting employees to defraud application fees. Because train tickets were difficult to buy, she did not make the trip. She knew that everything she did was outside the law and that she should bear the responsibility for her actions alone.</p>
<h3>Xiangcheng Town, Suzhou, Grain Hoarding Case Adjudicated, Wang Shengchu Sentenced to Half a Year</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 21st] The Lichang Rice Mill in Xiangcheng Town, under the jurisdiction of the county, was previously found by the Suzhou County Government to have hoarded over a thousand shi of rice, both rough and polished. Considering that the factory's business was not the buying and selling of grain, but only processing on behalf of customers, and that it had purchased and hoarded a large quantity of grain, which was a clear violation of the grain control regulations, the hoarded grain was sealed up, and the manager, Wang Shengchu, was arrested and transferred to the Wujiang District Court for legal action. The trial has now concluded. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Xiyong announced the verdict: Wang Shengchu was sentenced to six months in prison, which, in accordance with Article 41 of the Criminal Law, can be commuted to a fine of one thousand yuan per day. The seized grain, excluding the amount stored for customers, which included one hundred and fifty market stones of purchased and hoarded rough and polished rice, and eighty-seven dan and ninety market jin of japonica rice, were all confiscated. This case is the first case in Suzhou of grain merchants being punished for violating grain control regulations.</p>
<h3>Editorial: Congratulating India's Rebirth</h3>
<p>At 10:40 AM (Greenwich Mean Time) on July 18, 1947, the British House of Lords, the upper house of the British Parliament, was holding a solemn ceremony: the King's Privy Council was meeting there, and the Lord Chancellor, dressed in formal attire and wearing something resembling hair, was presiding over the meeting. The Clerk of the Parliament, using 11th-century Norman French, declared: "The King wills it thus." In this historically significant setting, the Indian Independence Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament with extreme speed, was approved by the King and came into effect. From that moment on, King George VI was no longer the Emperor of India. The rebirth of India and the birth of the Indian Union and Pakistan were announced to the world at that time. It was truly a historically significant day: the British Empire withdrew from India from that moment on. Although the formal birth of Pakistan and the Indian Union would have to wait until August 15, the fate of these two new nations was sealed on July 18. As a neighboring country with contiguous land, we cannot help but express our heartfelt congratulations on the rebirth of India. Now that Britain is withdrawing from India, the independence and autonomy that the Indian people have demanded is about to become a reality; we wish the Indian Union and Pakistan prosperous national fortunes in the future, even though, strictly speaking, these two newborn countries have not yet been formally born. However, due to the formal completion of this Indian Independence Act, July 18 can undoubtedly be said to be the birthday of these two new nations.</p>
<p>This meeting of the House of Lords ended 200 years of British rule in India. There is no need for us to reiterate this 200-year history here. The world already has a public opinion on this. Especially since 1877, when Queen Victoria was crowned Empress of India, the situation in India has been somewhat stable in these seventy years, and various constructions in transportation, mining, and water conservancy have been undertaken. We cannot but express our admiration for the achievements of the British in governing India. Just as people cannot live on bread alone, the material construction of the British in India ultimately could not suppress the super-material demands of the Indian people. The Indian people's independence movement surged under these circumstances. The unmet aspirations after the First World War were realized after the Second World War, and we cannot but express our infinite admiration for the Prime Minister of Britain, Clement Attlee. It is due to his foresight that India has been reborn today. The withdrawal of the British Empire from India has become a reality, and Winston Churchill, the former prime minister who was unwilling to settle the affairs of the British Empire, must be feeling a thousand emotions. No wonder this old man was not seen at this meeting of the House of Lords.</p>
<p>It is true that the India after Britain's withdrawal from India will not be a unified India, but rather two Indias: the Indian Union and Pakistan. We do not find the birth of these two new nations surprising. India is a continent second only to a continent, and since the beginning of history, there has never been political unification on this subcontinent. The Mauryan Dynasty and the later Mughal Empire, which are famous in history, did not achieve the unification of India politically. According to the epic Gilgit-Baltistan and Shakuntala, etc., during the Vedic period before the Mauryan Dynasty, Indian culture was also limited to a corner. A unified India is an ideal. This rebirth of India, dividing India into the Indian Union and Pakistan, can be said to be a necessary stage in achieving the unification of India. There must be division before there can be union. The accumulation of irreconcilable feelings between India and Islam has been around for a long time; this division of India and Islam can be said to allow each to get what they want. We cannot but admire the British's high-mindedness in its policy towards India, but the various difficulties that the newborn Pakistan may encounter are probably ten or a hundred times greater than those of the newborn Indian Union. In terms of economics, not to mention, this will be a situation of industrial Indian Union and agricultural Pakistan. The industrialization of Pakistan will certainly not be achieved in the short term; however, the Indian Union already has its industrial base. Seeing that the national flag of the modern Indian Union has abandoned the hand-operated spinning wheel representing Gandhism and replaced it with a turbine, one can see that the Indian Union is advancing in the direction of industry. However, the position of Pakistan is truly important. Beyond the Hindu Kush Mountains to the north is the Soviet Union. It is situated at the crossroads of the East and West: it is not only the vanguard of the Indian Union, but has also become the outpost of the Western world. Britain has politically withdrawn from India, but its moral responsibility does not seem to be easily shrugged off for the time being.</p>
<p>Although India has gained a new life due to the birth of these two new nations, there are still many problems facing India. The status of the princely states is a noteworthy issue. According to the intentions of the British government, the various princely states in India seem to have to "choose one to serve" between the Indian Union and Pakistan. The Indian National Congress also claims that it will not allow the independence of the princely states; however, there are rumors of organizing a "Rajikistan" on the side of the princely states. Although the latter is not entirely reliable, the British will not allow the brewing of this movement. However, since there is this rumor, it is quite noteworthy. There are two or three hundred princely states in India, among which Kashmir in the northwest, Hyderabad in the center, and Mysore and Travancore in the south are particularly well-known. The majority of the population of Kashmir are believers in Islam, and there are fewer problems with its transferring to Pakistan. However, even in Kashmir, it is questionable whether the Hindu prince is willing to join Pakistan. How the status of the Indian princely states evolves is an important key to the situation in India thereafter. In addition, in India, there is also Portuguese India, and there is also French India. Now that India has encountered a new life, these problems will inevitably be resolved one day. We hope that the newborn India can take good care of itself in the current turbulent international situation!</p>
<h3>The Outbreak of War in Indonesia</h3>
<p>The war in Indonesia has now officially broken out! Dutch troops, including the Marine Corps trained by the U.S. military, began an offensive against the Republic of Indonesia yesterday, using blitzkrieg tactics to occupy various organs of the Republican government and arrest 200 "rebellious" figures, including Indonesian Republic Deputy Prime Minister Gani and other government officials. At the same time, battles are raging in various parts of Java and Sumatra, especially in Surabaya, Bandung, and Palembang. In the turbulent world situation, the outbreak of the Indonesian war is truly regrettable!</p>
<p>Since the surrender of Japan, the situation in Indonesia has been one of armed conflict, and bloody events have occurred from time to time. Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor-General Van Mook himself is an Indonesian native and is trusted by the Dutch government. He should have been able to reconcile the views of both Indonesia and the Netherlands; however, it was this Van Mook, born in the Dutch East Indies and of Indonesian descent, who launched the war against Indonesia and ordered the use of troops. What a kind of irony this is for Van Mook!</p>
<p>The direct cause of this war in Indonesia is due to Indonesia's refusal to the Dutch request to jointly establish a constitution and police with the Republican government in Indonesia. We believe that the Indonesian government cannot be said to have no reason for this. Because of this request, it aroused popular dissatisfaction, which ultimately led the Netherlands to use force in an attempt to suppress the national aspirations of the Indonesian people with military force. The Netherlands has truly revealed its imperialist face. We believe that this is not a wise move. Needless to say, the sympathy of the world belongs very clearly to that side.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that the political struggle among the Indonesians for their independence movement is quite fierce. Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir resigned two months ago because he could not stand the coercion of the "left-wing political groups," and Indonesian politics was thus manipulated by radicals, which led to the failure of the negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands to proceed smoothly in the past two months. Now that the war has broken out, it is undoubtedly the inevitable result of the rise of left-wing radicals. Precisely because of this, we hope that the Dutch government can act with caution and patience, and strive to end the combat operations as soon as possible in the shortest possible time, without further expansion, in order to restore peace and order. The current international situation is too turbulent, and we cannot allow the creation of events that would increase turbulence!</p>

Sjahrir said that Indonesians should meet the Dutch army in the valleys.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 21st] Fifty Dutch Air Force planes and seven army divisions have been deployed on various lines in Java. The Dutch raided Indonesian airfields near Madiun in Java and Surakarta in Central Java. The Indonesian news agency said that the Dutch army attacked in western Java at dawn, and the two sides were exchanging fire with machine guns and artillery when the electricity was cut off. There was fierce fighting near Semarang. Dutch aircraft also attacked the Yogyakarta airfield. Commerce in Batavia has come to a standstill. The Republican rupiah is worthless on the black market. The Dutch East Indies guilder once fell in price, but rebounded after news of the Dutch advance.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 21st] Dutch troops, including US-trained marines, launched an offensive, seizing various agencies of the Republican government in a lightning attack before midnight and arresting about 200 key rebels. The Dutch cup [a misprint of 'chief'] Van Mook also formally announced that the Dutch army's attack on the Republic had begun at midnight. He also said: If the situation does not escalate, we will only engage in local warfare. Van Mook also stated the Dutch position, saying: If Indian leaders change their attitude, we will still consider it.</p>
<p>[United Press, The Hague, 20th] Dutch Prime Minister Beel today addressed the nation in a radio broadcast, saying that the government has now authorized Dutch East Indies Acting Governor-General Van Mook to mobilize troops at midnight today, Java time, to begin vigilance operations.</p>
<h3>The Plight of a Million Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies Uncertain</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 21st] Although Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor-General Van Mook has announced that military operations will be limited to local areas as much as possible, the course of events is very likely to force the Dutch army to take comprehensive action. Whether the Republic of Indonesia will soften at the last moment or fight to the end is still difficult to predict. However, judging from the basic facts, the Indonesian army will definitely launch large-scale scorched earth activities in some areas, especially those far from the seaports and demarcation lines. The areas currently controlled by the Dutch army include Batavia, Bandung, Surabaya, Palembang, Semarang, Medan, and Padang. It is estimated that there are about one million overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra, most of whom reside in areas controlled by Indonesia. Now that the situation has deteriorated, the future of the overseas Chinese will depend on the actions of both the Dutch and Indonesians. The Dutch army's military operations and the artillery, coastal artillery, and air force's shelling will inevitably cause losses to the overseas Chinese. As for the Indonesian side, the overseas Chinese will inevitably suffer arson, robbery, and extortion. This will especially be the case in the outposts of Java and Sumatra.</p>

<p>[Our Own Dispatch] London, 21st Broadcast: British Prime Minister Attlee stated in the House of Commons that the political assassination case in Burma cannot change the British government's established policy of granting independence to Burma.</p>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] London, 21st Broadcast: British Prime Minister Attlee announced today in response to a question from Eden that Indian troops will be dispatched to Burma when necessary.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 20th] Authorities here said that the shocking assassination case in Burma will not change the British government's determination to implement the constitution agreed to by the Burmese Constituent Assembly. The British side also hopes that the Burmese authorities can prevent all sections of the people involved in the constitutional work from being intimidated by this tragedy. Officials here are very pleased with the swearing-in of the new Burmese government and hope that Burmese politicians will continue to cooperate in drafting the constitution, and especially hope that the new government will take measures to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 21st] The new Burmese government led by Thakin Nu held its first meeting today, but the work of government agencies in various places has not returned to normal, and rumors have spread that riots have occurred in northern Burma.

The British Burmese Affairs Department also said that police found a jeep, several rifles, and a submachine gun in U Saw's courtyard.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rangoon, 20th] It is learned that the criminal suspects arrested by the authorities, in addition to U Saw and Thakin Ba Sein, also include Ba Gyan, son-in-law of Ba Maw, the puppet prime minister under Japanese rule, U Saw, leader of the Greater Burma Party, and Lin Wan, who has close ties with the "Red Flag" Communist Party.</p>
<p>The Left and Right Wings Plan to Join Hands</p>
<p>The Communist Party also participated in the mourning and held sympathetic demonstrations. After the Communist Party was expelled from the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League in November last year, it opposed the League's policies, but recently there have been reports that the Communist Party and the League may reach a compromise. Communist leader Thakin Than Tun also condemned political terrorism today, saying that the negotiations between the Communist Party and the League are progressing smoothly and that it is now time to join hands. However, the Communist Party issued a declaration, saying that the Burmese people should now recognize that the real enemy is British bureaucrats and their lackeys. Aung San, etc., can be said to have died at their hands. The British must know that when Aung San, etc., led Burma, the British could not continue to rule Burma.</p>
<p>Aung San's Remains to Receive State Funeral Next Month</p>

<h3>Truman Submits Economic Report Outlining US Ability to Aid Europe; The United States Must Continue to Assist Those Who Can Help Themselves</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] President Truman has submitted an economic report for the first half of the year to Congress, stating that the United States may not be able to maintain the amount of aid to Europe this year next year. Judging from the current domestic economic situation, although efforts are increased and the national economy responds to the government's call and orders, the scope of assistance we have promised may still not be fulfilled. Therefore, Europe should first allocate and use all its resources before considering the assistance that the United States can provide under the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>Secondly, the United States' surplus materials may no longer be able to supply foreign countries as in the past six months. However, the United States should still intensify its efforts to help Europe, because this policy has long-term and permanent benefits. It should be known that the United States spends only a small portion of its war expenses on economic assistance. In fact, this assistance is even a prerequisite for achieving peace. The United States has abundant resources and should be able to improve the people's living standards and continue to produce goods for export. The three special committees appointed by the government are responsible for studying the issue of US aid to foreign countries, and are currently compiling a catalog of European needs and estimating the materials that the United States can supply within its capacity. US aid to foreign countries should focus on one condition, that is, the United States is now prepared to discuss the issue of aid to European economic recovery, but the countries concerned must first submit their own plans before obtaining this aid. The United States must continue to assist those who can help themselves. To handle this new plan for aiding foreign countries, it is also necessary to study the economic impact that large-scale US export trade will have. If the export plan is balanced, countries whose living standards are already higher than before the war will not aggravate their poverty. This plan is also the center of American foreign policy. However, the current domestic economic situation still needs to be adjusted one by one. For example, the accumulation of monetary reserves needs to prevent speculation. Raising wages needs to not cause a rise in the cost of living. Only then can the living standards of the whole be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Wallace Analyzes US Economic Trends</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 21st] Former US Vice President Wallace met with the New York correspondent of the Yugoslav official news agency Tanjug and said that he believed that the Marshall Plan could delay the occurrence of an economic depression in the United States. He also said: If the Marshall Plan divides the world into two, or if its primary purpose is to revive Germany to confront the Soviet Union, then he opposes this plan. Wallace said: US production has reached an extremely high level, and the number of employed people has broken the record for peacetime. The cost of living has increased by one-third last year, so there may be widespread dissatisfaction with high prices by 1948, and at the same time, there may be a trend towards entering an economic recession. But if the Marshall Plan's aid loan plan is passed by Congress, the economic depression is expected to be delayed until 1950 or 1951.</p>
<h3>Since the United States Eliminated Communists, the Department of the Army Has Dismissed More Than 800 People</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] The Department of the Army announced on the 20th that since the General Staff began its work to eliminate communists, more than 800 military and political personnel have been dismissed for disloyalty.

<h3>Western Countries Fail to Reach Consensus; The United States is Working Hard to Salvage the Situation</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] US foreign policy officials, who were worried a week ago about the East and West sides breaking down, have now begun to draft the Marshall Plan to prevent the Western countries themselves from tending to split. This is because France has stated that if the revival of Germany cannot satisfy France's security requirements, France cannot promote the Marshall Plan with it. According to France's demands, the Rhineland should be separated from Germany, and the Ruhr area should be internationalized, etc. Germany's future industrial potential is its main problem, and Western Europe seems to be close to breaking down over this. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech at the miners' picnic last Saturday seems to be a symbol of changing Britain's diplomatic style.</p>
<h3>France Will Do Its Best to Ease US-Soviet Confrontation</h3>
<p>French Prime Minister Ramadier Said</p>
<p>[United Press, Perpignan, France, 21st] French Prime Minister Ramadier declared at a party meeting today that France will do its best to prevent the United States and the Soviet Union from confronting each other, and try to make the the two [Germany] countries return to unity to prevent the East and West from splitting. The Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the European conference to discuss the Marshall Plan cannot be regarded as the final decision.</p>
<h3>Internal Rifts Become More Apparent; Katayama Cabinet Wavering; Socialist Party Still Insists on Nationalizing Coal Mines</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Prime Minister Katayama invited reporters to give a speech because the Diet was scheduled to reconvene on the 25th, briefly stating: At the upcoming peace conference, in order for Japan to increase its international credibility, it hopes to create a government united by the whole country, that is, to strengthen the unity of the three factions in the cabinet and further hope that the Liberal Party, the central force of the opposition party, will give sincere assistance. If various bills of this Diet fail to be submitted on time, it is due to the dereliction of duty of responsible officials. However, after investigation, if it is true, it is planned to cancel the half-day work system of summer committees and strictly supervise them.</p>
<p>There are also criticisms of the new price decisions and emergency economic countermeasures as policies that force laborers to endure hardships. However, the current cabinet has not forgotten that it is a cabinet backed by laborers, so it hopes that those who criticize can understand and assist it. As for the issue of national management of coal, it is the Socialist Party's promise to the people, and it absolutely hopes to realize it. Although there are opposing opinions among the three parties in the ruling coalition, the result has been decided within the agreement of the four-party policy, so it is believed that it can be submitted to the Diet this time. If it cannot be realized, it is absolutely not planned to resign en masse. In addition, this cabinet will not fail to prepare for corporate reorganization due to difficulties. Recently, after establishing unemployment countermeasures, it will use reasonable and common-sense means to reduce the number of unemployed people as much as possible.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] Political circles here predict that the Katayama cabinet seems to have encountered serious difficulties and may be reorganized or resign. It is said that regarding state affairs, the rift between Foreign Minister Hitoshi Ashida and Cabinet Secretary-General Suehiro Nishio has become increasingly wider. The internal conflicts in the Katayama cabinet include the following factors: (1) The Democratic Party is very angry about Nishio discussing national affairs directly with the Allied General Headquarters regardless of Ashida's duties or through the normal channels of the Central Liaison Office (headed by Sata). (2) The delayed progress of coal mine nationalization and other social bills. (3) The appointment of Kurusu as Minister of Finance and Hiroo Wada, a leftist member of the Socialist Party, as Minister of Economic Stabilization.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 21st] It is learned that the House of Representatives will soon discuss the government's proposed "Political Parties Qualification Act," the purpose of which is to exclude small parties, including the Communist Party, from the parliament. The bill is currently being studied by the caucus of each party in the House of Representatives.</p>

According to Mr. Shi's proposal, a special person can obtain 1 million tons of grain this year, 1.5 million tons next year, and 2 million tons each year in 1949 and 1950. The purpose of this move by the Soviet Union is to weaken the United States' influence in European affairs.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] Regarding British-Soviet trade negotiations, according to reliable sources, the British and Soviet governments will simultaneously announce the results of these negotiations in London and Moscow in the near future. Although the British Ministry of Commerce has not yet received any reports on the exact results of the negotiations, the Soviet Union is expected to export timber to Britain. The goods that the Soviet Union may supply to Britain are grains and canned fish.</p>

<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] MacArthur will send his personal plane, the Bataan, to meet Australian Deputy Prime Minister Evatt, who is expected to arrive at Kure Port in Japan around July 25.

<p>[United Press, Geneva, 21st] The second meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe has ended. After ten days of discussion, the rift between the two major forces in the East and West has become more apparent, but at the same time, there have been some achievements that can promote self-help in European economic recovery. The committee is composed of seventeen European countries and the United States, and has now established several specialized committees to consider ways to solve Europe's post-war economic problems. The division of opinions between the East and the West has deep roots.

<h3>Request for Increased Movie Ticket Prices: Rejected by the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Decision Pending Submission of Accounts</p>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Liang Qitian, Chairman of the Shanghai Cinema Commercial Association, visited Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday afternoon to discuss the request to increase ticket prices by 100% starting from the 24th of this month. According to Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, the request to double prices has been rejected. The department in charge submitted a proposal to allow a 50% increase, but it has been indicated that the proposal lacked a basis. An increase must have a reason and cannot be based solely on insufficient expenses. If there are claims of losses, then accounts must be submitted to determine if the losses are genuine, how much is lost each month, and how much the increase must be to maintain income and expenses. Daily necessities during the July price surge have already been suppressed by the authorities, and rice prices have fallen to over 300,000, so entertainment businesses cannot arbitrarily increase prices to increase the burden on the people. Therefore, the matter of increasing movie ticket prices will be decided after the submission and review of accounts.</p>

<h3>Silver Shops Have Been Closed for a Long Time: Workers Demand Salary Increase</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The silver shop industry has been closed since the promulgation of economic emergency measures. Although repeated petitions have been made, they have not been able to resume business. Since the closure, the employees of the shops have been receiving a monthly subsidy from the employers of one picul of rice and 130,000 yuan for food expenses.

They have requested a salary increase based on the cost of living index, bringing it to over 600,000 yuan, which has been rejected by the employers. The matter has been referred to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. According to Director Wu yesterday, the employers have been closed for a long time, and it is impossible for the workers to demand salaries based on the cost of living index.

<h3>Gold Hidden in Crucian Carp: Magic Scam, Coppersmith Falls for It Out of Curiosity, Narrow Encounter Between Enemies</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Wei Gufan, from Henan, is skilled in magic and performs at the Daguan Theatre on Xujiahui Road. His skilled techniques have been well received by the audience. Yuan Jinfang, a coppersmith, was deeply impressed by it and was curious. He verbally expressed his intention to become Wei's apprentice and learn magic. On the morning of the 11th of this month, Wei drew a talisman for Yuan, burned it into ashes, wrapped it in yellow paper, and said that the talisman could ward off evil spirits, but it needed gold items to suppress it, otherwise the talisman would escape. Yuan believed it to be true and took off two gold rings and gave them to Wei. At this time, Wei chanted incantations and moved his hands, wrapping the gold rings in the talisman ashes and putting them into the belly of a crucian carp. He instructed Yuan to take it home and hang the fish at the door to suppress evil spirits. However, because the weather was too hot, the crucian carp gradually rotted and smelled bad after 30 hours. Yuan took the fish down and checked the paper wrapping in the fish's belly. The gold rings had disappeared, and there was only a copper ring and a copper hoop. Only then did he realize that he had been scammed. On the afternoon of the 19th of this month, Yuan encountered Wei in front of the Chunjiang Hotel on Ninghai Road and took Wei to the Songshan Road Police Station, transferring him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on charges of fraud. Yesterday, after questioning by Prosecutor Liang Gengshun, he was ordered to be released on bail pending trial.</p>

<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zhao Fubao, a prostitute from the Anhuei Brothel at No. 8, Dashun Lane, Xizang Road, received a guest surnamed Wang, who stayed in her room for two nights. At 4:00 PM on the 19th, Wang came to the brothel and invited Zhao to watch a play at the Paris Grand Theatre on Lin Sen Road. However, on the way, Wang suddenly said that he needed to go to a nearby bank to withdraw money, and asked Zhao to wait for a while. Soon, Wang returned with a mesh bag containing three bundles of legal tender. The prostitute was overjoyed at the sight and went to Tianchang Jewelry Store on Lin Sen Middle Road to buy jewelry. Chen Lukang, a shop assistant, took out a seven-chen gold solitaire diamond ring. Both parties agreed on the price of 17 million yuan. Wang looked at it for a long time and lavished affection on the prostitute. He then said that he needed to get a price quote from a jewelry store next door, and handed the mesh bag to the prostitute. At that time, the woman did not suspect anything and waited by the counter. After half an hour, he did not return. The store began to suspect and questioned the woman, who then told the truth.

<h3>Implicated in a Traitor Case: Three Victims Accuse Zhang Shuping and Others of Extortion</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Zhang Shuping (resident of No. 23, Bobo Lane, Luban Road), Yang Yusheng, and Shen Jiamin were recently sued in the District Court by Zhang Jiyuan (manager of Hongxing Timber Company in Yangjing West Town, Pudong), Jin Jusheng (manager of Yuanshengtai Timber Company in Yangjing West Town, Pudong), and Shen Abao (manager of Shen Baoji Shipyard in Pudong), accusing them of extortion. According to the plaintiffs' complaint, because Wang Qingfu accused Xu Chengen of being a traitor, the Commercial Inspection Office summoned Zhang Jiyuan and others to court to testify. Zhang Shuping, who claimed to be a staff officer of the Ministry of National Defense, learned of this matter. On the morning of May 7, Zhang sent Shen Jiamin to meet with Yang Yusheng at Zhang Jiyuan and others' places, claiming that Zhang Shuping saw an official document from the High Prosecutor's Office at the garrison headquarters last night, entrusting the police department to arrest Zhang Jiyuan, Jin Jusheng, Shen Abao, and Yang Yusheng, and that there were fifty seals to seal up the four people's properties. They also claimed that Zhang Shuping was an old friend of Commander Xuan and was familiar with Director Tao and Deputy Director Zheng. To eliminate the matter, 400 million yuan was needed. At the very least, more than 100 million yuan was needed. At that time, Yang Yusheng also pretended to be on the side of the victims, proving that it was true, and helped with the intimidation, causing Zhang Jiyuan and the other two to believe it was true. However, because the demanded amount was too large and they could not raise the money, Zhang Shuping voluntarily reduced the amount to 30 million yuan on the 27th. At 9:00 AM on the 30th, Zhang Jiyuan, Jin Dexi (Jin Jusheng's son), and Xi Zuguang (Shen Abao's representative) met with Yang Yusheng and Shen Jiamin at Zhang Shuping's home at Dashijie Da Sanyuan. Xi only brought 6 million yuan, and Zhang and Jin brought 7 million yuan each. The three of them brought a total of 13 million yuan in cash. The remaining 17 million yuan was promised to be paid in the afternoon. Zhang Shuping then took out a confession statement, saying that if the garrison headquarters summoned them for questioning, they should answer according to the confession statement, and he would take care of everything for them. While they were talking, the inspection office of the garrison headquarters had already received a confidential report that someone was impersonating the name of the department to swindle money, so the department sent detectives to Zhang's place to search, and seized the confession statement and 13 million yuan in cash on the spot, apprehending both the people and the goods. They were initially investigated by the military law office of the garrison headquarters, and then transferred to the district prosecutor's office for questioning. Recently, the victims Zhang Jiyuan, Jin Jusheng, and Shen Abao sued Zhang Shuping and others to the District Court, requesting the District Prosecutor's Office to stop the investigation. The District Prosecutor's Office has approved the request and transferred the entire case file to the Criminal Division of the District Court for handling yesterday.</p>

Because Liu falsely claimed to have purchased it for 6 million yuan, it has already been confiscated by the court for the crime of privately trading in gold. Wu stated that he was ordered to go there by Liu's report and that police detectives were guarding the front and back doors. Liu claimed that the gold bar was purchased from a gold shop for 6 million yuan. After witnesses Jin Jiayin and Zhang Haidong were summoned to court, and after the lawyers from both sides debated, the court announced that the sentence would be announced on the morning of the 28th.</p>

While passing Waitang, a passenger named Cheng Yiting had seven million one hundred thousand yuan in legal tender forcefully robbed by a person dressed in military uniform. After obtaining the money, the person jumped from the train and fled. The passengers were in uproar, but the train was moving too fast to do anything.

<h3>舞女方珍安葬　黃土一坏長眠地下　捧花臨穴恩客神傷</h3>
<p>Dancing Girl Fang Zhen Buried; A Mound of Yellow Earth, Sleeping Underground Forever; A Pained Regular Customer Lays Flowers on the Grave</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The body of Fang Zhen, the dancing girl who committed suicide in full dress at Fuxing Park on the 6th of this month, having pre-arranged a burial plot and sent out suicide notes before calmly taking poison, was moved from the Anle Funeral Home to the Hongqiao Cemetery at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. The only person who came to send her off was Zeng Yongxiang, a regular customer during her lifetime. Fang's relatives, her uncle Zhu Chunbao and cousin Zhu Fangju, did not attend, so the cemetery was quiet and desolate.</p>
<p>Zeng Yongxiang held two bouquets of fresh flowers and placed them on Fang Zhen's coffin, looking melancholy for a long time. The coffin was made of cedar wood, with dragon and phoenix patterns and the words "Longevity Pavilion for Ms. Fang Zhen of Zhongshan, Guangdong" carved on the front, which was pre-ordered by Fang Zhen from the China Funeral Equipment Company. The burial plot was on the west side of Hongqiao Cemetery, on lower ground, quite a distance from the group of graves, alone, with water filling half of it. The funeral workers first removed the accumulated water, sprinkled a large amount of lime, and then lowered the coffin into the ground. The stone tablet (with a small bird engraved on it and flowers inlaid on both sides), which Fang had ordered from Jianhua Marble Company, had not been carved yet, so the grave was only covered with yellow earth. A man named Wang from Jianhua Company, who knew Fang well, also came to take care of things yesterday. When Fang ordered the tablet from him, she falsely claimed that her sister had lung disease and was about to die, so she was setting up a tablet for her. The day before her suicide, she went to Wang again, claiming that she was going to another place, and if her sister died, please arrange for the tablet to be properly placed. At that time, Wang did not know that the so-called sister was Fang Zhen herself. After Fang's coffin was put into the ground, Zeng Yongxiang quietly left. He was still full of praise for Fang's character during her lifetime, and said that he would bring fresh flowers to Fang's grave in the future. It is enough comfort to the deceased that a beauty with a tragic fate has a guest who understands her. One more thing worth mentioning is that several funeral workers, after hearing about Fang's suicide, were deeply touched by her actions of arranging her own affairs before death, so they were willing to bury her voluntarily without accepting any tips.</p>
<p>Fang's mother died of illness three years ago and was also buried in Hongqiao Cemetery. Fang personally set up a monument for her. Her grave is on the east side of the cemetery, about a hundred yards from Fang's current grave. Mother and daughter are neighbors and can lean on each other underground.</p>

Almost all the beautiful actresses of Hollywood's major studios have passed through his lens. Huang recently vowed to shoot a film in the United States or China that introduces the Chinese way of life and reflects Chinese problems. The first film in his plan is about the life and problems of overseas Chinese in the United States. Huang believes that the cost of filming is about US$250,000 to US$300,000, and it will be welcomed by audiences in both China and the United States when it is released. The female lead of this new film will be Lili Zhou Ren, a Chinese actress living in the United States. Zhou has been in the United States for two years, specializing in English and acoustics. Huang has discussed this plan in detail with Chinese researchers studying cinematography in the United States. Copies are being prepared, and Huang hopes to start filming this year after another film is completed. In addition to making a film about the lives of Chinese overseas in the United States, this renowned cinematographer also hopes to make a series of educational films in his motherland in the next few years to complement a large-scale literacy and public health program. These films will all be in Chinese and will feature the 1,300-character basic vocabulary created by Yan Yangchu. Yan's vocabulary has taught 60 million Chinese to speak and write within 96 hours. Huang also stated that he has prepared a fund of US$500,000 for making these educational films, most of which are donations.</p>
<p>Huang was born in Panyu, Guangdong, but grew up in Washington State, USA. Huang's father was a farmer. Huang was a professional boxer when he first entered the film industry, but in 1916, he decided to switch careers and become a cinematographer. After living in the United States for more than 30 years, Huang recently stated: I would like to point out the difficulties and advantages of Chinese people living in the United States. As for the former, Chinese people inevitably suffer discrimination. For example, in San Francisco, overseas Chinese form groups and live in the center of this big city, symbolizing the two cultures of China and the United States, which, although close to each other, have a distance. However, on the other hand, the United States is doing its best to train talents for China to help China's construction.</p>

<h3>護士助產職業教育　關係民族保健工作　教部再提示注意要點四項</h3>
<p>Nursing and Midwifery Vocational Education Relates to National Healthcare; The Ministry of Education Further Reminds to Pay Attention to Four Key Points</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 21st] The Ministry of Education believes that nursing and midwifery vocational education are related to national healthcare. It has repeatedly ordered schools to promote improvements. In order to further improve and promote these efforts, it has issued four key points for attention: (1) Internship work for students in nursing and midwifery vocational schools is extremely important. In the future, when establishing new nursing or midwifery vocational schools, it is necessary to ensure that there is a sound affiliated teaching hospital (for nursing schools) or maternity hospital (for midwifery schools) before they can be approved for establishment. Those already established but without affiliated hospitals or maternity hospitals should immediately set up such facilities within a limited time, or quickly establish cooperative internship methods with local public and private hospitals for remediation. (2) When nursing and midwifery vocational schools are unable to find qualified nurses or midwives with suitable qualifications to serve as principals, the Chinese hospital directors or other senior technical personnel in the hospitals may be temporarily allowed to serve concurrently. However, all actual teaching and guidance work should still be the responsibility of nurses or midwives. (3) There is currently a severe shortage of nursing and midwifery teachers in the country. All factories and bureaus should pay attention to cultivating reserves in accordance with previously issued methods. The originally stipulated proportion of part-time teachers in each school may be temporarily adjusted, but it should still be based on the principle that it does not exceed a ratio of two to one. (4) When private nursing or midwifery vocational schools apply for registration, the standards for their operating expenses and start-up costs should be handled in accordance with the amount for "home economics schools."</p>

<h3>Dong Shouyi Reports on Attending the World Games Committee Meeting; Seven Major European and American Cities Eagerly Compete to Host the World Games</h3>
<p>Dong Shouyi, Director-General of the China National Sports Association, held a tea party at the Kangle Restaurant yesterday at 4:00 PM to entertain sports and media circles and report on his attendance at the International Olympic Committee meeting in Sweden. Shao Rugan, Director-General of the Sports Association, executive directors Jin Zhaojun, Wu Bangwei, and Shen Kunnan, Lu Xiangqian, Le Xiurong, Shen Huichun, Peng Wenyu, and sports journalists, totaling over 30 people, attended. In addition to his report, Mr. Dong publicly exhibited a large number of photos he brought back. The following is a transcript of Mr. Dong's speech:</p>
<p>The Circumstances Before and After Going Abroad</p>
<p>Originally, China had only one member of the International Olympic Committee. Later, the number was increased to two, namely Wang Zhengting and Kong Xiangxi. It was not until 1945 that the number was increased to three. Because I was also approved as a member of the committee, I received a telegram from the committee inviting me to attend. I repeatedly consulted with Mr. Wang, Mr. Kong, and Chairman Zhang Boling of the YMCA. Mr. Wang and Mr. Kong were unable to attend due to busy schedules, so I attended alone. After requesting instructions from Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, I was granted a subsidy for travel expenses and a passport. After a week of rushing around, I left Beijing on June 3rd and arrived in Sweden on the 16th.</p>
<p>The International Olympic Committee has a total of 43 member countries. Representatives from 23 countries and 28 committee members attended this time. However, including the directors-general and staff of the sports associations of various countries and the representatives requesting to host the World Games, the total number reached 124. The conference lasted for four days (from the 18th to the 21st), and more than 20 resolutions were passed. However, the original text is in French. After someone translates it, it will be announced. Therefore, I will provide a summary report as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Approved new committee members from various countries, approved North Korea as a member country, and approved its participation in the next World Games, but the committee member was not approved.</p>
<p>(2) Approved amateur rules.</p>
<p>(3) Approved the 1952 Summer Olympics to be held in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, and the Winter Olympics to be held in Oslo, the capital of Norway.</p>
<p>Competing to Host the World Games</p>
<p>The competition among various countries to host the next World Games in 1952 can be described as extremely intense and enthusiastic. A total of seven major cities applied this time, including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, Minneapolis in the United States, as well as Amsterdam and Helsinki. Three places applied for the Winter Games: the United States, Italy, and Norway. Finland received 14 votes first, and after two rounds of voting, it was approved with 15 votes, more than half.</p>
<p>Each of the major cities applying to host the Games has formed a representative group, and even the mayors have personally come forward. They especially value publicity. The key points of competition for each country are listed below for our country to learn from:</p>
<p>(1) Apply through the sports association or Olympic committee of each country, with the government as a backing.</p>
<p>(2) Carry a formal official letter.</p>
<p>(3) Representatives attend to explain the reasons for hosting the Games in detail.</p>
<p>(4) The city's sports history and sports atmosphere.</p>
<p>(5) Experience in hosting sports games.</p>
<p>(6) Understanding of the meaning and spirit of the Olympics.</p>
<p>(7) Fundraising, food and accommodation, and transportation issues.</p>
<p>(8) Climate and the characteristics of the city, especially the beauty of the scenery and cultural contributions.</p>
<p>(9) In addition to photos and promotional materials, there are also models, maps, and movies.</p>
<p>(10) Extracurricular activities and close ties with committee members.</p>
<p>After the closing of the conference, on the 23rd, I went to London to contact the World Games Organizing Committee about the accommodation and food expenses for our country's athletes in the future, the date of the meeting, and the issues of the inspection team. I stayed for two weeks and left the UK on July 7th to return home.</p>
<p>Finally, I must state that: (1) Although the two executive directors of the Sports Association of China, Hao and Wu, were notified of the attendance at the Olympic Committee, it is regrettable that I did not have the opportunity to meet with them. (2) The request to host the 1956 World Games in Beijing is purely a rumor.</p>

<p>To prepare for representing China in the swimming competition between China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, the Chinese Youth Swimming Team had a friendly prelude with the US Navy yesterday at the Shanghai Race Club swimming pool. The audience was not open to the public due to the small size of the pool, with only about a hundred people present.

In addition, the first place in the 100-yard breaststroke was originally Chinese Youth Team member Chen Jingzhong, but unfortunately, he was disqualified due to an incorrect posture.

<h3>The Four Banks Joint Treasury Establishes a Traveling Audit Team to Assess Loan Effectiveness</h3>
<p>Work is expected to be completed within two months</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Four Banks Joint Treasury Traveling Audit Team held its inaugural meeting at the Four Banks Branch in this city at 4:00 PM yesterday. Xu Baiyuan, Secretary-General of the Joint Treasury, and Diao Minren, Deputy Secretary-General, along with ten others, attended. Xu Baiyuan delivered a speech on behalf of the Chairman of the Joint Treasury and discussed the direction of the audit based on the Traveling Audit Work Procedures.</p>
<p>The team has one director, Diao Minren, and two deputy directors, Qiang and Jiang Jiannong. The remaining 16 auditors are transferred from existing staff of the Four Banks Joint Branches and the Four Banks and Two Bureaus. The office is located at the Four Banks Branch in this city. It is planned to complete the initial investigation of more than 100 important manufacturers within one month, and then expand to other regions. The work is expected to be completed within two months. This report will be submitted to the government as an important reference. The content of Xu Baiyuan's speech and the Traveling Audit Work Procedures are recorded below:</p>
<p>The purpose of the loans organized by the Joint Treasury is to assist production and revive the economy. Before the loans are approved, the investigation and review must be thorough. After the funds are disbursed, the use of the loans and the production achievements of the manufacturers after obtaining the loans must be strictly audited and assessed to prevent malpractices.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the area where industry and commerce are concentrated in our country. After the victory, the Joint Treasury approved nearly a thousand loans in Shanghai, with a cumulative total of four or five hundred billion. The number of loans and the amount are the highest in all regions. Therefore, the current traveling audit work will begin in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The economic situation after the war has changed greatly. This traveling audit will be conducted by industry group so that the staff can have a full understanding of the latest situation in each industry they are responsible for. The business and financial performance of each factory in the same industry can be compared to assess their strengths and weaknesses. The report of the audit team will be an important reference for determining the loan policy and reviewing loan applications in the future.</p>
<p>Audit Procedures</p>
<p>Article 1: In order to effectively assess the use of funds by each borrowing institution and to fully realize the effectiveness of the loans, the Joint Treasury will jointly appoint traveling auditors with various banks and bureaus to go to each borrowing institution to check accounts.</p>
<p>Article 2: The main points of the traveling audit are as follows: (1) Whether the loan contract is effectively implemented and whether the use of the loan is appropriate. (2) Whether the production and sales costs of the borrowing institution are reasonable and whether the quality of the products meets the standards. (3) Whether the storage of raw materials is appropriate and whether the quantity of collateral meets the requirements. (4) Whether the accounting system is sound and whether the figures in each asset-liability account are accurate. (5) Whether the personnel organization of the borrowing institution is sound. (6) Other relevant financial and business matters and general matters.</p>
<p>Article 3: After checking the accounts, the traveling auditors shall, within one week, prepare an audit report detailing the audit process, along with suggestions for improvement or matters that should be corrected, and submit it to the Four Banks Joint Treasury for review.</p>
<p>Article 4: When performing the audit, if the traveling auditors have any questions, they may inquire in detail from the person in charge of the borrowing institution and consult their account books, statements, and related files. If necessary, they may ask the person in charge of the borrowing institution to provide a written explanation.</p>
<p>Article 5: When traveling auditors are on duty, the Joint Treasury will issue traveling audit credentials for proof.</p>
<p>Article 6: These procedures shall be implemented after being approved by the Four Banks Joint Treasury.</p>
<h3>The Textile Construction Company Decides to Assist in the Export of Native Cloth to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Mr. Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Company, believes that there is a great need for our country's native cloth in Southeast Asia and plans to open up a path for our country's native cloth to be exported to Southeast Asia in the near future. In order to encourage native cloth merchants to actively produce, Mr. Wu plans to exchange cotton yarn for cloth through the Textile Construction Company and then export it through the company. According to Mr. Wu, he plans to start in the Nantong area. Because the domestic production of native cloth has been declining due to sluggish sales, if the native cloth energy can be continuously exported in the future, the production volume of native cloth will definitely increase, thereby saving our country's endangered native cloth industry. At the same time, the government will also be able to obtain some foreign exchange, which is truly a win-win situation. Finally, Mr. Wu hopes that the quality of native cloth can be actively improved.</p>
<h3>The Textile Construction Company Pays Cash for Warehouse Receipts to Manufacturers Who Have Not Yet Paid for Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Provisional Joint Distribution of Cotton Yarn by the Textile Adjustment Committee originally stipulated that private yarn factories should provide 10,000 pieces, but as of yesterday, only 8,032 pieces that had been received earlier. It is understood that in order to avoid unexpected problems that may arise during future price negotiations, the committee has paid cash to manufacturers who have not yet paid for cotton yarn to purchase warehouse receipts. In addition, Mr. Wu Weijing, the person in charge of the Joint Distribution Office, said that the cotton yarn paid by yarn factories in other cities totaled more than 2,000 pieces. Last Wednesday, 1,009 pieces were distributed to practical cotton yarn manufacturers in 14 counties, including Hangzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiangyin, and Suzhou. Approximately 800 pieces are still stored in Nantong, more than 100 pieces in Changzhou, more than 300 pieces in Wuxi, and more than 80 pieces in Hangzhou. The office still plans to distribute them to practical users on the spot according to the original plan. The 800 pieces in Nantong are mostly from Dasheng Factory No. 1 and No. 3.

<h3>With a Strong Selling Atmosphere, Chinese Stocks Trend Lower</h3>
<p>The news that General Marshall's visit to China was on another mission yesterday further dampened market sentiment. The bulls in the industry collapsed again, and outside speculative funds remained on the sidelines. The market lacked support, and a pessimistic atmosphere prevailed. Various small stocks were dim, and the over-the-counter Yongsha market was intermittent and trending lower. At noon, Yonggong, matches, Zhongsi, Xinhua, and Huafeng fell to their limits. In the morning, due to the easing of silver, all immediate delivery stocks rose except for Zhongfa, which fell. However, all deferred delivery stocks opened lower, and market sentiment was weak.

After deferred delivery of Meiya broke through the 500 yuan mark, the situation changed completely starting at 12:00 PM. Immediate delivery of Yonggong fell to its limit by 67, and deferred delivery by 126, and deferred delivery of Xinguang first fell to its limit by 84. Deferred delivery of Huafeng and Zhongsi matches also approached their limits, and deferred delivery of Meiya fell to 469 yuan. Immediate delivery fell to 463 yuan. 85, 106, 219, and 84 supplied, very close to the limit down. Near the close, although 186, 154, and 23 sold, 85, etc. continued to buy in, and deferred delivery of Meiya rose to 484 yuan. Deferred delivery of Xinnuo was bought by 85 and also rose to 2,950 yuan at the close. After the close, deferred delivery of Meiya was sold by 231 and struggled around 480 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, immediate delivery stocks Yonggong fell to its limit, Xinnuo, Huaman, Xinguang, Meiya, and Zhongfa each fell by about 15%, Jingfu and Qinxing fell by 10%, Xinhua fell by 5%, Rongfeng Cement and Xinya Underwear each fell by 10%, Tongyi Datong, Wuhe, and Jinglun fell by about 5%, Business, Guohuo, and Li'an slightly decreased, and matches fell to their limit at the close.

Among the over-the-counter old stocks, Huashang, Zhabei, and Dasheng fell by 5%, and the rest were flat.</p>
<p>Over-the-counter dark market bidding for Yongsha was interrupted from time to time, initially trading at 197 yuan to 200 yuan, falling to 176 yuan and 179 yuan, and finally at 179 yuan to 182 yuan. Interest was 1 jiao 9 fen and a half to 2 jiao 4 fen.</p>

<h3>Key Responsibilities of the Oil Allocation Committee: Six Items Including Distribution, Pricing, Verification, and Registration</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] To handle the allocation and supply of imported oil, the Transportation Control Committee (輸管會) has established Gasoline and Diesel Allocation Committees under its Import Quota Allocation Department. These two committees were formed and established on the 8th of this month. The Oil Allocation Committee will have one chairman, to be held by Deng Hui, Deputy Director of the Quota Allocation Department. There will be five members, with one representative each from Mobil, Texaco, Asiatic Petroleum, and China Petroleum companies. One additional member will be jointly nominated by other registered oil importers. In addition, there will be approximately ten secretaries and staff.</p>

<h3>Sparse Transactions in the Tea Market</h3>
<p>Green tea varieties such as Chou Chen, Chen, and Pearl Tea are mostly sold to French Morocco, but exports have remained sluggish since production costs exceeded overseas prices. Yongxing Foreign Firm in this city, regardless of cost, intends to promote sales there, resulting in an increase of inquiries regarding the product. Unfortunately, inventories in the market are low, and sellers are simply raising prices, thus the trend has a shortfall of supply. The transactions are only scattered, and prices are going higher. Moreover, the year 35 Yuanda brand and Pearl Tea have increased about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per dan compared to last week. As for other varieties, there are still only old black tea. Wuchang Tea Company has a good demand, and the market remains stable. Local tea shops on this street continue to purchase domestic tea, and customers in various places also consume it well, and the entire process is consistent.</p>
<h3>Oil Business Association Sets Buying and Selling Terms</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Oil Business Association of this city has noted that disputes often arise from transactions between oil market peers. The main reason is due to a lack of credibility. Therefore, following the recommendation of the Oil Industry Mediation Committee, the association's board of directors and supervisors revised and approved four terms, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Buyers and sellers must absolutely abide by their credit.</p>
<p>(2) The delivery period for both parties should not exceed the third day after the transaction. If the buyer requests more than three days, the warehouse rent shall be borne by the buyer.</p>
<p>(3) The check paid by the buyer must be dated on the day after the transaction and must not be intentionally returned. If such a situation occurs, the transaction will be suspended on the market.</p>
<p>(4) The seller must not mix in inferior goods. If there is a dispute about inferior goods, the parties should jointly assess it within three days after the transaction at the same price as at the purchase, and the profits and losses will be calculated accordingly. The inferior goods mentioned above must be determined by a fair person before it can be confirmed.</p>
<h3>Sharp Drop in Rice Prices at Production Areas: Both Japonica and Indica Rice Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than 3,400 piculs of rice arrived in the North and South markets. Prices in the mainland fell sharply, causing sluggish digestion. The first batch of new Zhejiang Indica rice to arrive in Shanghai led to a market slump. People are shaken, and Japonica and Indica rice prices are chaotic, falling by 2,000,000, 3,000,000, or 4,000,000 yuan, etc.</p>
<p>Wheat flour, due to the strong market in the mainland, stabilized accordingly, rising slightly by 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran was stable, bean cake sales were still practical, rising slightly by 1,000 yuan. Yingkou cake fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and soybean digestion was also weak, falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. The situation in Hankou was the most stagnant, falling sharply by 10,000 yuan. Mung bean prices plummeted severely. Secondary products were difficult to find buyers and fell sharply by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. High-interest Nanyang moved to handle the sale, and prices rose by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Red bean sales were not good, dropping by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and barley was also weak, dropping by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Broad beans have been continuously weak and unresponsive, arrivals are connected, digestion is cold and loose, and prices fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum was slightly taken by wineries, up slightly by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Corn distilleries made a move, and the market rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Sesame foreign firms also made inquiries, and the market turned stable. Raw peanuts moved slightly in South China, rising by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Slack Cotton Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was slack because the monitoring team's yarn and cloth group will be established. It is said that personnel will be regularly stationed in the market to monitor the transactions, resulting in a somewhat fragile market sentiment. Long positions liquidated considerably, but the industry did not absorb intentions strongly, and customer groups also lacked the initiative. In addition, as construction projects sold off, the market was sufficient, and sentiment reversed. Finally, the 42-count Blue Phoenix price made a low of 17,600,000 yuan, down 400,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. The 20-count Special Double Horse also fell by 300,000 yuan to 12,700,000 yuan. Double Yarn Horse was 10,700,000 yuan, down 200,000 yuan. The 16-count Guangming dropped by 500,000 yuan, and the unique price was 9,500,000 yuan. Other yarns fell by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan or 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, etc.</p>
<h3>Weak Cotton Cloth Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the cotton cloth market, due to the still tight funds for the industry, the rate of sell-off was high. Customer groups in Guangdong sold off due to transportation difficulties, and large accounts in the market sold even more, making the market even weaker. As a result, the price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was as low as 43,600,000 yuan, down 17,000 to 18,000 yuan compared to Saturday. Fine cloths of various grades such as Five Blessings, Color Ball, Blue Chicken, and Yanghe also fell by about 15,000 to 20,000 yuan. The markets for other white, grey, bleached and dyed cloths, coarse cloths, and serge plain cloths all fell across the board, but the markets for blue cloth and Shilin cloth showed uneven performance.</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Slightly Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton and national yarn cloth markets declined, and the prices were weak. Yarn factories absorbed when prices were low, so trading was still busy. The prices opened for various grades for delivery to factories: Zhengzhou fine lint was 2,180,000, Lingbao was 2,200,000, Shashi was 2,150,000, Han fine was 1,970,000 to 2,040,000, Chongtong was 1,950,000 to 1,980,000, and Huoji was 1,730,000.

<h3>Banks Ordered to Suspend Business Gradually Completing Liquidation</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to Li Lixia, Director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, the financial institutions ordered to suspend business by the Ministry of Finance in the past six months include Jianguo Bank, Chengda Yinpu, Jianghai Bank, and Datong Commercial Bank. The Ministry of Finance entrusted the Central Bank to assign auditors to supervise the liquidation of these banks. Jianguo and Chengda have already completed liquidation. Jianghai is also nearing completion, and Datong has a small amount of deposits, so liquidation should not be a problem.</p>
<p>Most of the deposits of Jianguo and Chengda have been repaid. A small number of Zhu Tiqing's funds remain; those belonging to Jianguo can be withdrawn from the Kunming branch, and those belonging to Chengda can be withdrawn from the Chongqing headquarters. Datong has very few deposits, and the reserve funds it has deposited with the Central Bank and the Clearing House are sufficient to repay all deposits. The savings deposits of Jianghai Bank's Shanghai Savings Department have already been repaid. There are still a small number of deposits in the business sector, which should not be a problem. The next step is to assign auditors to supervise the liquidation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the deposits and reserve funds of various clearing firms in the national banks are proportionally returned by the national banks according to the number of deposits they return. All of these are allocated in a separate liquidation account.</p>
<p>Mr. Li finally said that the key point of this inspection of financial firms is to ban black market gold, banknotes, and foreign exchange, and the goal is to help financial firms move toward a standardized path, not to passively promote closing and liquidation. The establishment of a financial firm must go through a long period of planning, concentrating capital and manpower, and then it can be completed. Therefore, active support is especially needed.</p>
<h3>Traffic Bank's Operation in Assisting Traffic, Public Works and Other Operations.</h3>
<p>Branch Restructuring</p>
<p>In April of this year, the Bank's repatriation work was gradually completed, and the head office returned to the east with the government. Regarding the branches in the reclaimed areas, after examining the environment, the preparations for resuming operations were made separately. Those in the rear areas that no longer needed to exist due to changes in the economic situation were appropriately adjusted. In total, sixteen units were rescued and withdrawn this year.</p>
<p>As for the number of branches approved for establishment this year, there are 84 units domestically, including Wuxi, Nantong, Changshu, Wujin, Yangzhou, Danyang, Rugao, Taixing, Jiangyin, Huaiyin, Baoying, Liyang, Gaoyou, Taicang, Haimen, Taixian, Dongtai, Pukou in Jiangsu, Yuyao, Wuxing, Quxian, Jiaxing in Zhejiang, Anqing, Tianjia'an in Anhui, Zhangshuzhen, Linchuan in Jiangxi, Zaozhuang, Licheng, Weixian, Zhangdian, Boshan in Shandong, Daye, Shihuiyao, Wuxue in Hubei, Xiangtan, Zhuzhou in Hunan, Tanggu, Baoding, Qinhuangdao, Mentougou in Hebei, Xuchang, Luohe, Lingbao, Xinxiang, Xinyang, Luoyang in Henan, Haikou, Zhanjiang, Chao'an in Guangdong, Guixian, Jinchengjiang in Guangxi, Zhangjiakou in Chahar, Yingkou, Jinzhou, Siping, Fushun, Anshan, Huludao, Kaiyuan, Benxihu, Jilin Andong in the nine northeastern provinces, which are located in all provinces of the reclaimed areas, especially in the northeast and northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>There are 2 units overseas, namely Hanoi and Saigon in Vietnam. As of the end of this year, the Bank had a total of 223 branch units, an increase of 70 units compared with the end of 1945.</p>
<p>Savings Business Situation</p>
<p>The Bank has been working hard to promote the savings business in the spirit of the past, so as to promote savings and absorb market capital. This year, we also paid attention to the water quota savings of industrial and mining employees, and improved education savings to achieve great results. With the turbulent prices and high market dismantling, the environment was originally extremely difficult for attracting savings. However, the Bank's savings amount can still increase year by year. This year, the original savings growth target was 4 billion yuan. As of the end of the year, excluding prize-winning savings bonds, US dollar savings bonds, gold-denominated deposits, and township public welfare savings bonds, it increased by 5.2 billion yuan compared with the end of 1945, exceeding the target by more than 1 billion yuan. If the domestic economic situation can tend to stabilize in the future, it can be predicted that the long history and good reputation of the Bank, as well as the further development of the savings business, can be predicted.</p>
<p>Promote Trust Business</p>
<p>This year, the Bank has actively promoted general trust business. To cite the most important examples, it assisted in the establishment of the Shanghai Securities Market and stationed in the market to handle settlement matters, so as to guide securities transactions into the right track. It undertook the fundraising for the Shanghai Ferry Company to assist the important public utilities in Shanghai, invested in the Shanghai-Minhang long-distance car wash company, and entrusted the collection of shares by various production business institutions. It also tried its best to restore or increase warehouses in various reclaimed areas to facilitate the exchange of materials and cooperate with import and export mortgage business. As of the end of the year, self-built warehouses included Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Changsha, Shashi, Chongqing, Xi'an, Jiangmen, Qingdao, Tianjin, Nanchang, Luxian, Chengdu, Baoji, Jinhua, Lanzhou, Guilin, Zhengzhou, Jiaxing, Bengbu, and Haiphong, etc. As for trust deposits, the original target for this year was 1.5 billion yuan. As of the end of the year, it increased by more than 15.8 billion yuan compared with the previous year, exceeding the expected target by more than 14.3 billion yuan. (End)</p>

<h3>Madame Damiling Sulong Returns from the Mongolian Communist Area</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Liu Yingyuan</p>
<p>Gui Sui, Twelfth Day Air Dispatch</p>
<p>Madame Guo Zengxiang, the wife of Suimileng Sulong, along with her second son, Da Jin-yi, escorted by funeral troops, cattle, sheep, and horses, escaped from the "Xi-Cha Military Region" of the Mongolian communist separatist area in East Sunit Banner, Chahar Province, and after four days and nights of marching through the desert, returned to Twelve Sumu, near Ji Ning County in Eastern Suiyuan. This time, Madame Da and her son's return to the motherland not only demonstrates the Mongolians' internal leaning and their longing for the Han people, but she also recounted to us, based on her own experience, the miserable lives of the Mongolians imprisoned on the border between Inner and Outer Mongolia. The following is a depiction of the plight of a small, displaced ethnic group, as described to the reporter by Madame Da in her delicate tone.</p>
<p>Outer Mongolian Army Enters Suiyuan</p>
<p>On August 10th of the year before last, when Japan announced its surrender, the Outer Mongolian army entered Suiyuan territory by truck. On the twentieth day of the seventh lunar month, they arrived at Twelve Sumu and immediately disarmed the defense divisions of the Eastern Four Banners. At that time, Damiling Sulong was the chief administrator of the Zhenghuang Banner and commander of the pseudo-Mongolian 7th Division. His troops were transferred to Donggong Banner, west of Baotou, for garrison duty. De Wang feared that Damiling Sulong would contact Chief Fu, so he sent him to Xinming County in northern Chahar for house arrest. Because Damiling Sulong was the most prominent figure in the Chahar tribe. In the early years of the Republic of China, when he served as the Zhenghuang Banner's Lieutenant Commander, he went to Outer Mongolia and rescued De Wang from the bandit camp of Jebtsundamba. Later, he served as the garrison commander of Pangiang, preventing Mongolian bandits from entering Chahar and Suiyuan. In the twenty-fifth year [of the Republic], when Li Shou-hsin and Wang Ying invaded Honggertu, Damiling Sulong led cavalry to assist the National Army in combat. Therefore, Outer Mongolia attached great importance to him. On the twentieth day of the seventh lunar month, they went to Twelve Sumu but found no one. On the tenth day of the eighth lunar month, they finally found Damiling Sulong in Xinming County and escorted him to Shangdu County for surveillance.</p>
<p>That time, the Outer Mongolian army entered Chahar and Suiyuan not to fight the Japanese army, but entirely to take advantage of the chaos, looting strong men and supplies, and seeking puppets for Inner Mongolian autonomy. They detained Damiling Sulong, forced him to order the troops to return from Donggong Banner, and claimed to equip the Inner Mongolian army with new Russian-style guns, completely equipping the temporarily assembled troops of Uleji Aosu'er, the commander of the pseudo-Mongolian 9th Division, with Damiling Sulong's weapons. Outer Mongolia was not satisfied with detaining Damiling Sulong, so on the twenty-first day of the eighth lunar month, they went to Twelve Sumu again, and Damiling Sulong's eldest son, Da Jingang, was also taken to Shangdu. Da Jingang graduated from the Central Military Academy and followed Chief Fu during the War of Resistance, serving as a special operations commander in Zhang Lisheng's unit. He was ordered to return to Zhenghuang Banner to receive the officers and soldiers of the pseudo-7th Division who had escaped from Shangdu. Unfortunately, his ordinary rifle could not withstand the Outer Mongolian army's automatic weapons, and as a result, he was tied onto a car and imprisoned with his father. Finally, he was escorted to Kulun with Uleji Aosu'er, and his whereabouts are still unknown. According to what Uleji Aosu'er told Da Tianren, he was undergoing training in a secret location.</p>
<p>After Japan surrendered, officials and civilians in the various Inner Mongolian banners felt very surprised and happy. They were happy to be free from the oppression of the enemy and puppets, and to see the light of day in their motherland again. They were afraid that the Han people would raise their heads and take revenge on the Mongolians. The Outer Mongolian side and Uleji Aosu'er took advantage of the latter mentality to incite the Mongolian people to take their families and livestock and flee to Outer Mongolia. There are no accurate statistics for the detailed numbers, but the cattle and horses alone filled both sides of the Zhangku Highway. Unexpectedly, the troops and people gathered at De Wang's residence</p>
<p>A Perspective on Inner Mongolian "Independence"</p>
<p>"The Mongolian compatriots in Chahar and Suiyuan provinces have followed De Wang and experienced a period of independent suffering. Now, when they recall the events of the past eight years, they still feel lingering sadness. Therefore, today, they do not feel any interest in Yun Ze's advocacy of autonomy." Madame Damiling Sulong used this passage as her initial confession when discussing the current Inner Mongolian autonomy. She said that on August 10th of the thirty-fourth year [of the Republic], when De Wang left Zhangjiakou, over seven hundred Mongolian compatriots automatically organized a Mongolian fellow-villagers association to maintain the safety of the lives and property of the Mongolians. On August 23rd, Yun Ze entered Zhangyuan with the communist army and, under the orders of the communist army headquarters, went to the Mongolian fellow-villagers association to carry out activities, incite young people, and win over princes. On November 21st, he convened the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Joint Conference, which established an executive committee and a standing committee, with five departments under its jurisdiction: organization, military affairs, propaganda, women, and youth, as well as a secretariat. Attached to it were the Mongolian Newspaper Office, the Mongolian Health Bureau, the Mongolian Industrial Company, and the Mongolian Academy. Each league, banner, and military district had branches and sub-branches. The chairman of the standing committee, the minister of military affairs, the chairman of the board of directors of the industrial company, and the president of the Mongolian Academy were all held by Yun Ze alone. Other organizations were also controlled by communist party members: (1) Secretary-General Liu Chun (communist), Director of the Secretariat Liu Jingping (communist), Chief of Staff Changdu Guleng, Minister of Organization Kui Bi (communist), Deputy Minister Gao Buzhabu (communist), Minister of Propaganda Huang Jing (communist), Minister of Women Min Zhong (communist), Director of the Health Bureau Hu Erqin Bilige, President of the Mongolian Newspaper Yong Fu (communist), Manager of the Industrial Company Zhao Yunshi (communist), Deputy Manager Guan Qiyi (communist). (2) Education Director of the Mongolian Academy Zhu Rong (communist), Director of the Administrative Department Su Jing (communist), Director of the Military Department Han Feng (communist). (3) Commander of the First Detachment Li Xiushan, Political Commissar Han Feng (communist), stationed in Habuga. Commander of the Second Detachment Li You-tong, approximately four divisions, in the Wangye Temple Hailar area of ​​the Northeast. Commander of the Third Detachment Hai Fulong, Commander of the Fourth Detachment in northern Chahar Uleji Aosu'er, roaming in eastern Suiyuan and northern Chahar. (4) League Leader of the Chahar League Chen Bingyu (communist), Deputy League Leader Haswazir, Director of the Branch Su Jianxiao (communist). League Leader of the Ulanqab League Moergen Batu, Deputy League Leader and Director of the Branch Yun Yili (communist). League Leader of the Bayannur League and Director of the Branch Kui Bi (communist). League Leader of the Xilingol League Song Wang, Deputy League Leader and Director of the Branch Hao Xin (communist). Among these people, after something, the Mongolians took all their carts, horses, cattle, sheep, and tents with them, leaving behind only women, children, and old men. Therefore, Uleji Aosu'er abducted more than 10,000 strong men to Inner Mongolia, but only over two hundred soldiers were equipped with Russian-style equipment and returned to Inner Mongolia with him. The rest all ran away along the way, and the remaining ones were opening mines in the deep mountains west of Kulun. The family members left behind in De Wang's mansion were separated from their wives and children and spent their days begging. Many froze to death on the grasslands in the winter before last and last year. Many Han people, their work did not extend to all places, because the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou in October last year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Joint Conference was disintegrated.</p>
<p>On May 20th of this year, the red elements in the eastern and western parts of Inner Mongolia, after obtaining a combined attack with Outer Mongolia, convened a national congress in Wangye Temple, Liaobei Province, and decided to establish the Inner Mongolia People's Autonomous Government, with Yun Ze recommended by Mao Zedong as chairman and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, Boyan Mandu as vice chairman, Ha Fengga as secretary-general, Qi Monan as minister of youth training, Kui Bi as minister of people's organization, Li Youtong as minister of military affairs, Asi Gen as minister of internal affairs, Temur Bagen as minister of economic affairs, and Namus Lai Zabu as minister of justice. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government currently has three corps. The commander of the Eastern Mongolian Corps is Qi Wenlin, who claims to have ten divisions, but the actual strength is 40,000 to 50,000 men, but weapons are supplied by a certain party. The Xicha Ba-U two corps were commanded by Uleji Aosu, with more than 5,000 people organized into seven divisions. Uleji Aosu'er himself concurrently served as the commander of the 11th Division, Ba Haiming as the commander of the 12th Division, Nao Ben Dalai as the commander of the 13th Division, Li Sheng as the commander of the 14th Division, Yun Jizhen as the commander of the 15th Division, Li Xiushan as the commander of the 16th Division, and Hai Fulong as the commander of the 17th Division. The troops in Eastern Mongolia were all pseudo-troops of the "Manchukuo", and the troops in Western Mongolia were all pseudo-troops of the "Mengjiang Government". Although they are united on the surface, the boundary between east and west is distinct, and within Western Mongolia, there are also rifts between Xicha and Bayannur. It is said that Eastern Mongolia is directly commanded and supplied by a certain party, while Western Mongolia is commanded and supplied by the CCP. Within the pseudo-government, Ha Fengga has the greatest power. Since Qi Daofu's death, he has led the Inner Mongolia Youth Revolutionary Party. Guo Hannan, Li Youtong, Guo Wenlin, and others are all his cadres. Yun Ze is just serving as a puppet. He is often not in Wangye Temple, but is now in Beizi Temple. The young people in Western Mongolia are drifting with him, very discouraged and disappointed. Many have recently escaped to Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>Madame Damiling Sulong and her second son, Da Jinyi, went to northern Chahar from Twelve Sumu in July last year because they feared that the communist army in eastern Suiyuan would settle accounts, and they took refuge in Ulan Naori, East Sunit Banner, for over a year. In order to win over Damiling Sulong, their property had not suffered any major losses. However, the Mongolian rich in the vicinity were all impoverished by the communist army, and the poor were generally plunged into famine because no one hired them to graze cattle and sheep. The princes of the various banners of the Xilingol League were either taken to Outer Mongolia or fled to Zhangjiakou, and the area was in a state of anarchy. Anyone with thirty or fifty guns could roam around. The communist army in Western Mongolia, who had been accustomed to living in cities and villages during De Wang's time, felt very awkward returning to the ancient grasslands. People from the Chahar and Xilingol Leagues went to Jehol to find Li Shou-hsin, while people from the Bayannur and Urat Leagues returned home one after another. This time, Chief Fu sent a motorized regiment and Ouyou San's cavalry from the Suiyuan Security Division to suppress the bandits in northern Chahar, and they have already defeated the Bayannur-Urat military region. Yun Jizhen, the commander of the 15th Division, was captured, and Hai Chenglong was left with more than 100 people. Uleji Aosu'er and Kang Jianmin's brigade from the Suiyuan Military Region of the communist army had jointly established a base in Hugermiao, West Sunit Banner. Since the year before last, they have not received assistance from Outer Mongolia, and since Kang Jianmin withdrew to Shanxi, he has not come to northern Chahar for more than three months. Therefore, Uleji Aosu'er saw that he could not gain a foothold near De Wang's mansion, and went to Abaga Left Banner to find Yun Ze in early June. Da Jinyi also told the reporter that Western Mongolia was Inner Mongolia under the former Qing Dynasty. In the second year of the Republic of China, when Outer Mongolia declared independence, Western Mongolia stood on the side of the country and fought against Jebtsundamba. Especially the Mongolian compatriots in Suiyuan Province were deeply influenced by Chief Fu. In the twenty-fifth year [of the Republic], they shattered De Wang's Mongolian Political Council in Bailingmiao with the Chahar-Suiyuan division. During the War of Resistance against Japan and the suppression of bandits, the people of Suiyuan and Mongolia mostly supported the government. Therefore, Western Mongolia did not gain the trust of a certain party and Outer Mongolia. If Chief Fu often sent troops to garrison in northern Chahar, the treasonous flames of the Mongolian bandits would definitely be limited to Eastern Mongolia and could not spread to Western Mongolia. In fact, Suiyuan and Mongolia have already been stabilized, and the banditry in Chahar and Mongolia is also nearing its end. Madame Guo Zengxiang, the wife of Damiling Sulong, came from a noble family in Manchuria. Her son, Da Jinyi, graduated from junior high school and has excellent Chinese skills.</p>
<p>Escaped from the Tiger's Mouth</p>
<p>Madame Damiling Sulong and her son entered the communist area of ​​northern Chahar from Twelve Sumu, partly because they feared that the communist army in eastern Suiyuan would settle accounts, and partly because they wanted to inquire about Damiling Sulong's whereabouts and also attempted to preserve the weapons of their eighty-odd guards. They lived in East Sunit Banner for eight or nine months. Uleji Aosu'er never told them the correct news in a roundabout way, and planned to confiscate their guns. After despairing, they conceived the idea of ​​escaping. On the eighteenth day of the third lunar month of this year, Da Jinyi secretly returned to Guisui first to express his attitude to Chairman Dong, and then returned to Ulan Naori to gather cattle and sheep. On the seventeenth day of last month, taking advantage of the opportunity that Chief Fu sent a motorized regiment to eliminate the Mongolian communists in northern Chahar, they were taken to Xinmin County, near Shangdu, by the support troops of the Zhenghuang Banner. Along with them, more than fifty Mongolian households from East Sunit Banner also escaped. The Zhenghuang Banner has allocated grasslands to allow these people who have lost their tents to graze cattle and sheep.</p>
<p>Welcoming Madame Da and her son's return was the anti-civil-disorder vanguard team of the Zhenghuang Banner. Such troops exist in all eighteen Mongolian banners in Suiyuan, and their aim is to eliminate sporadic communist bandits. In the recent two or three months, the food supply for Madame Da's people and horses has entirely depended on the secret transportation of the anti-civil-disorder vanguard team of the Zhenghuang Banner. Because the Mongolians in the communist area deeply hate the treacherous bandits, they never reported Madame Da's dealings with eastern Suiyuan to Uleji Aosu'er. The commander of the anti-civil-disorder vanguard team of the Zhenghuang Banner, with the Chinese name Ren Desheng, served as a company commander under Damiling Sulong. This time, he led more than forty soldiers, not only escorting Madame Da and the refugees from East Sunit Banner to eastern Suiyuan, but also, on the way to Ulan Naori, passing through Abgaitushan in West Sunit Banner, killed Monk Jileger, the chairman of the communist army's Bayannur-Urat working committee. That person had studied in the Soviet Union and served as the pseudo-Zhenghong Banner chief administrator when the communist army occupied eastern Suiyuan.</p>
<p>The Mongolians originally thought that the CCP rebellion was an internal affair of the Han people. In the recent two years, they have realized that the communists of the whole world are one family. Although the Mongolian communists have not yet implemented a liquidation policy, they know that as long as they are militarily successful, the local bullies and ruffians will immediately rise up to overthrow and struggle, just as Outer Mongolia only declared independence and did not implement communism. After Jebtsundamba was assassinated, the people's misfortune followed. Madame Damiling Sulong's original departure from eastern Suiyuan was not necessarily to escape the war between the Kuomintang and the communists, but later she felt that the quagmire was getting deeper and deeper, and her husband and eldest son had been captured. Her second son also had the possibility of following in his father and brother's footsteps. So she quickly escaped from the sea of ​​suffering. Now, Madame Da turns pale at the mention of the Communist Party. She told the reporter that she plans to send her second son to Peiping to continue his studies in the second half of the year. She also does not dare to return to Twelve Sumu and plans to live in Jining County to manage her family affairs. Now, the Mongolians near the Outer Mongolian border are moving to the vicinity of Daqingshan. Wu of the Siziwang Banner, Shabei Zi of the Darhan Banner, and Qi Qingkang, the recorded Jasak of the Zangmengan Banner, have been living in Guisui as absentee landlords since the Japanese surrendered.</p>
<h3>The Vigilance That Labor Unions Should Have Against the Communist Party</h3>
<p>— Original work by D. Dubinsky, President of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union of America, specially translated by this newspaper's translation department</p>
<p>In any country, the activities of the Communist Party within labor unions not only affect the organized labor movement but also cause significant harm to the welfare and tranquility of the people.</p>
<p>The Communist Party is omnipresent. Under central command, they infiltrate church groups, educational institutions, women's clubs, scientific societies, and even merchant associations. However, labor unions have always been their special target. If they cannot control labor unions, the Communist Party will fail. Labor unions are their economic cornerstone; if they cannot command worker groups, all other connections will lose their effectiveness. Labor organizations are the largest and most important non-governmental groups in society. They are an integral part of the intricate mechanism of modern life.</p>
<p>The House of Labor</p>
<p>The Communist Party's activities within labor unions are of great significance. They bore into the "house of labor" like termites. However, due to the discrepancy between their totalitarian spirit and aims and the ideals and policies of free unionism, they have not yet become the main part of labor organizations.</p>
<p>Free unionism may have its shortcomings, but these shortcomings can be remedied because the procedures of labor unions, although sometimes not entirely in line with ideals, are democratic in spirit.</p>
<p>However, the Communism that infiltrates labor unions and other organizations is conspiratorial. Its basic policy is to eliminate the rule of majority and aims to establish a one-party dictatorship, with labor unions serving as stepping stones to achieving this goal.</p>
<p>Special Agents</p>
<p>The Communist Party's method of seizing control of labor unions is simple: Party special agents first identify a union member they intend to seize, engage with them, and then gradually win over a small number of like-minded members. With the assistance of the special agents, they devise a plan suitable for the Communist Party's platform.</p>
<p>Initially, the party representative singles out a union member who has some knowledge of procedural matters, and then sets the stage to introduce the unknowing member to an important official or a well-known party spokesperson, and takes them to various cocktail parties and dances.</p>
<p>Next comes the activity during labor union meetings. Before the meeting has officially started, the Communist Party "elements" begin to act. An unknowing member first proposes a motion, followed by debate, often extending late into the night. Members who want to go to bed early gradually slip out of the meeting, and the Communists gain an advantage. As a result of the vote, they finally achieve victory.</p>
<p>The Communist Party cannot act alone and must be assisted. They must become a crowd, a part of a "united front" or a "people's front." Because they are skilled in meeting techniques and because they do not hesitate to use any means or avoid any deception, they are always able to rush ahead.</p>
<p>However, the Communist Party "elements" do not necessarily nominate party members to occupy the position of union chairman. They can find a non-Communist with potential who is amenable and gentle to serve as the nominal chairman, as a cover for actually controlling the labor union. Of course, practical positions such as secretary, accountant, and organization minister must belong to Communist Party members.</p>
<p>A Smokescreen</p>
<p>The entire structure of the Communist Party is highly centralized, the so-called "democratic centralism." But this is just a smokescreen. Their organization is prepared for rapid action because when the party's policies are handed down, blind military discipline must be followed absolutely, without room for debate, only "discussion and approval."</p>
<p>The Communist Party boasts of being the "vanguard" of labor, which is completely deceptive. In reality, they often destroy many labor unions through factional struggles. They call themselves "progressives," but in fact, they are "violent reactionaries," as some have called them.</p>
<p>In their view, ethics and morality are merely "bourgeois" virtues. Therefore, within the labor union, even a conservative or reactionary element will be supported as long as they can approve of pro-Soviet or pro-Communist policies.</p>
<p>Totalitarian Color</p>
<p>It is clear that pro-Communist elements have been able to make progress among the labor masses due to the vanity and lack of integrity of non-Communist labor union members. And opportunism is a common trait.</p>
<p>Even in our international union, any local official, no matter how conservative or incompetent, can avoid criticism from the Communist Party and even gain their support as long as they support resolutions favorable to Soviet foreign policy or Communist Party policies.</p>
<p>In the Communist Party's view, the measure of a labor union leader's "progressive color" is not whether his labor policies are sound, but whether he is willing to agree with Soviet policies. This is why I consider the Communist Party to be totalitarian reactionaries.</p>
<p>In fact, truly progressive labor leaders are most often attacked by these leftist elements, while conservative labor leaders remain unscathed. The reason is simple: Liberal unionists understand the history and conspiracies of the Communist Party and cannot be deceived by them. The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union has been under attack by the Communist Party for many years for this very reason.</p>
<p>Control Methods</p>
<p>The Communist Party often works day and night, desperately trying to control progressive labor unions. With these labor unions as their base, they can launch offensives against more conservative union strongholds. Once they control a number of progressive unions, their power extends into the core and decision-making bodies of the entire labor movement. This means that the Communist Party has representatives participating in various committees and groups, can meet with the President, have access to important government departments, and approach secret intelligence and deliver it to party committees.</p>
<p>I do not deny that the Communist Party sometimes struggles to improve the status of labor. But they are only willing to do so when such policies do not conflict with the interests of the Soviet rulers. If they believe that abandoning demands on employers, ignoring the suffering of workers, or engaging in maximum "class cooperation" is beneficial to them, they will do so.</p>
<p>Various Consequences</p>
<p>What would be the consequences if the Communist Party were to control the American labor union movement?</p>
<p>Let us cite the words of the famous Soviet labor union leader Tomsky to answer this question: "If there is a time we can imagine that all the labor unions in Germany will march shoulder to shoulder with the German Communist Party tomorrow, then we can determine that within five minutes of the combination of these two major forces, a Soviet government will be established... If there is a time we can imagine that the British labor unions and the Communist Party combine, then a Soviet government will also be quickly established in Britain."</p>
<p>It is clear that the success of the Communist Party in seizing various positions and gaining control of labor unions is not only related to the labor organization itself but also has a close relationship with the entire country.</p>
<p>Today's France is a prominent and tragic example. The French Communist Party now dominates the General Confederation of Labor. Undoubtedly, the French Communist Party's appeal to voters is mostly due to their control over the metal industry, coal industry, transportation industry, and other major labor organizations.</p>
<p>If one day the Communist Party has the same control over the American labor union movement and thus obtains the same decisive political position, then the United States, at the mercy of a ruthless foreign totalitarian dictatorship, will feel the same unease and danger, and the independence of the country will be severely threatened.</p>
<p>Need for Vigilance</p>
<p>Some believe that the Communist Party is skilled in organizational skills, which is completely absurd. The strong will of progressive and democratic forces within labor unions can defeat them. Our experience in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union has repeatedly proven this point.</p>
<p>In a recent election held by a branch of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union with 25,000 members, there were fewer than 500 self-identified or known Communist Party members. However, due to their activities, propaganda, and rumor-mongering tactics, they surprisingly obtained more than 5,000 votes as a result of the voting. Assuming that only 9,000 members actually participated in the voting, then fewer than 500 Communist Party members could control a branch with such a large membership. Fortunately, the progressive forces were vigilant, led effectively, and were able to mobilize 80% of the members to participate in the voting, enabling them to defeat the forces led by the Communist Party by a ratio of three to one.</p>
<p>Work Guidelines</p>
<p>Therefore, progressive elements of labor unions, in order to deal with this situation, must do the following:</p>
<p>(1) We should work as hard to organize the majority of members within the labor union as the Communist Party does to organize the minority of members.</p>
<p>(2) Enlightened unionists do not need to prevent Communist Party infiltration by prohibiting Communist Party propaganda. Eliminating the Communist Party's position on the political stage or prohibiting Communist Party members from joining the labor union is not an effective way to compete with the Communist Party. We must rely on education and discuss various labor issues daily.</p>
<p>(3) We must do our best to make the labor masses fully understand the importance of attending meetings and taking on responsibilities. We must take the lead in solving the pain in stores and factories. Because if progressive union members do not participate in these tasks, the Communist Party will take over to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>(4) In order to ensure that the resolutions of the labor union truly reflect the will of the majority, each branch should require its members to attend all meetings and participate in all elections, thereby preventing the Communist Party from controlling the labor union with a minority.</p>
<p>(5) As labor union leaders, we must lead by example, work hard, and strive to solve daily labor problems, such as improving working conditions, raising living standards, and protecting political rights.</p>
<p>(6) Active labor leaders should not engage in empty rhetoric and compete with the Communist Party.</p>
<p>If we follow these guidelines, we will not find it difficult to defeat the forces occupied by the Communist Party in the labor union each time we compete with them. These Communist Party bacteria, like other germs, are most likely to grow in darkness and ignorance. They will not breed in labor unions where leaders and members are vigilant, loyal, and capable.

<h3>Island of Fiber - A Glimpse into the Paper Industry</h3>
<p>— Ling Feng</p>
<p>Aeronautical report from Taipei, 12th</p>
<p>Accompanying the decline of Chinese culture, the paper industry in China has also been underdeveloped. The Northeast paper industry, which was relatively large-scale under Japanese management, was ruthlessly destroyed after the war. The Tianjin paper mill is said to be about to be auctioned off. Currently, the most promising paper industry is probably the Taiwan Paper Industry Corporation, which is jointly operated by the Assets Committee and the Taiwan Provincial Government. This cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Taiwan has always been very developed in papermaking because of its abundant raw materials. In the past, during the Japanese era, the emphasis was on sugarcane pulp production because Taiwan's sugar industry was unparalleled in the Far East, with an inexhaustible supply of bagasse that could be utilized. Among them, the Tainan factory (formerly Yanshuigang Pulp Company) had the largest output, producing 100 tons of sugarcane pulp per day. The Taipei factory (formerly Luodong Taiwan Xingye Co., Ltd.) mainly produced Western paper, with a daily output of 48 tons. The Shilin factory (formerly Taiwan Paper Manufacturing Co., Ltd.) produced 20 tons of paperboard per day. The above output far exceeded the needs of the province, and the surplus of paper relied mostly on foreign exports for adjustment. For example, pulp was mostly transported back to Japan for paper processing in the past, some Western paper was transported to coastal areas of our country, and paperboard was mainly transported to Nanyang, Northeast China, and North China, which had gained a very good reputation. After the restoration, the paper industry company's various paper mills continued to operate under the separate supervision of the receiving personnel, but during the war, the factories were destroyed, raw materials were scarce, and machinery and equipment could not be replenished, so the output was drastically reduced, and it could not be measured in terms of distance compared with the past.</p>
<p>Last May, the paper industry company was officially established, and it took over the various factories, buried itself in restoration work, repaired and purchased, and tried to increase production in every way. However, the most difficult thing was the lack of felt and copper wire mesh. The old ones were full of holes and were really unbearable for reuse, while the new ones ordered from abroad were slow to arrive, which affected production significantly. At present, a batch of the ordered equipment has finally been delivered one after another, and all five factories under its jurisdiction have been able to resume production. In the future, the increase in Taiwan's paper industry is really a very promising industry in China. The following is the recent production and sales situation of each factory of the company:</p>
<p>From January to May: The Taipei factory produced a total of 1,091 tons of Western paper (including newsprint and printing paper) and sold 909 tons.</p>
<p>The Shilin factory produced a total of 1,751 tons of paperboard and sold 1,263 tons.</p>
<p>The Taichung factory produced a total of 626 tons of Western paper and sold 446 tons.</p>
<p>The Tainan factory produced a total of 70,988 sheets of sugarcane board and sold 13,180 sheets.</p>
<p>The Kaohsiung factory produced a total of 13 tons of Western paper.</p>
<p>The total sales proceeds of the above amounted to more than 200 million legal tender dollars, and the paperboard and woodfree printing paper shipped to Shanghai were worth approximately 2 billion dollars.</p>
<p>In order to increase production and expand sales, the paper industry company has formulated a plan for the future. It is estimated that the monthly production of newsprint will be 200 tons, printing paper 750 tons, wrapping paper 100 tons, bag paper 200 tons, yellow paperboard 400 tons, white paperboard 200 tons, and pulp 1,250 tons. In addition to sales within the province, it is planned to sell 425 tons of printing paper, 80 tons of bag paper, and 30 tons of wrapping paper to the Beijing-Shanghai area. 150 tons each of yellow and white paperboard, 900 tons of pulp; sell 100 tons of printing paper and 50 tons of yellow paperboard to South China; and sell 100 tons of yellow paperboard to Nanyang. If this plan can be completed, Taiwan's paper industry will naturally exert a greater force in contributing to China's cultural cause. The general manager of the paper industry company is Dr. Xie Hui, an old professor from Jiaotong University. His hair is already gray, but he is biting a pipe, and his spirit is as vigorous as a young man. He said that he will do everything possible to promote the realization of this plan.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou's Progress on the Road to Rebirth After the System Change</h3>
<p>— Liang Feng, Special Correspondent of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Aeronautical report from the 17th</p>
<p>Due to the severity of the floods throughout the province, an atmosphere of gloom is shrouding the entire city of Guangzhou. Almost every one of the million-plus citizens has a heavy weight on their hearts because this unprecedented disaster in the past 30 years has directly or indirectly affected every citizen! At this time, there is only one piece of exciting news, and that is that Guangzhou has been approved to be restored as a municipality directly under the Executive Yuan. Although this is only an administrative system change, the city has been upgraded, the city government officials have also been promoted, and the status of the citizens seems to have been upgraded accordingly. Although being a citizen of a special municipality is not necessarily more prestigious than being an ordinary citizen, everyone always thinks that Guangzhou will have slightly more adequate government funds in the future after the system change, and it can also hope for direct subsidies from the central government to carry out various constructions that benefit the citizens. Everyone is looking forward to a vision of building a new Guangzhou, which is so beautiful and brilliant. Therefore, everyone is focusing their efforts on providing disaster relief to the victims on the one hand and enthusiastically celebrating the success of Guangzhou's system change on the other hand, making this gloomy atmosphere suddenly clear.</p>
<p>Citizens' Expectations - Guangzhou's Rebirth</p>
<p>Originally, Guangzhou was the largest city in South China, occupying an important position in the economy, culture, society, and internationally. The population has also exceeded one million, and it is also the revolutionary base with a glorious history. It already has all the conditions of a special municipality. However, after the restoration, because it was a provincial-level city, the city treasury's income was limited, and the subsidy for restoration and construction costs was far from that of a special municipality, making it difficult to carry out all municipal facilities. In the past two years, although the authorities have made careful plans, it is probably due to economic reasons that many plans cannot be implemented or cannot be thoroughly implemented. This is like a person who is malnourished, showing an unhealthy state everywhere. Objectively speaking, to this day, all municipal facilities have really failed to meet the demands of the citizens. Let's see: prices continue to rise, now catching up with the Beijing-Shanghai area, the housing shortage is still a serious problem, the number of armed robberies has not decreased compared to before, electric lights are dim, telephones are not working, roads are uneven, and unclean tap water are still the same, and there is no improvement. In particular, the so-called "shuxing" (meaning bribes) atmosphere left over from the enemy-puppet era has always been impossible to eliminate. The police can openly collect "shuxing" fees from vendors, and even when citizens report to the Public Works Bureau to build houses, they deliberately create difficulties. The existence of all these stains naturally has many factors. The authorities naturally have considerable difficulties. Therefore, the general public can only hope that these unsatisfactory realities will become a thing of the past from now on, and everyone will sincerely wait for the rebirth of Guangzhou to arrive!</p>
<p>The Mayor's Handling of Matters - Stable and Serious</p>
<p>The mayor of Guangzhou after the system change is still the original mayor, Ouyang Ju, and there has not been much change in personnel, which is something that the citizens are happy about. Because this way, all the original plans can be thoroughly implemented, without hindering the implementation due to personnel changes. Mayor Ouyang is from Zhongshan, Guangdong, and graduated from the 6th term of the Baoding Military Academy. He participated in the revolution in his early years and served as deputy commander of the Independent 1st Division of the National Revolutionary Army, commander of the 17th Division, commander of the Humen Fortress, director of the Guangdong Provincial Capital Police Bureau, deputy commander-in-chief of the Guangdong-Jiangxi-Fujian Border Area, and member and secretary-general of the Guangdong Provincial Government. He naturally has considerable experience in doing things, especially his excellent construction of Guangzhou's police affairs during his tenure as police chief, which is still praised by the general public. Probably because he is a military man, his temper is a bit impatient, but he is kind and friendly to people, and he is very serious about things and does not allow for any carelessness. Moreover, he emphasizes practicality and does not like empty talk. Therefore, on the day of Guangzhou's system change, he specifically stated to reporters that he is a pragmatist and that his future administration will prioritize what the citizens urgently need, and he will never be afraid of difficulties, let alone shirk responsibility. The meaning is that everything will be expressed through facts, and there is no need to announce any great plans in advance, so as to avoid becoming an empty check that cannot be cashed out in the future if it cannot be realized, and instead be criticized by everyone. From this point alone, it can be seen that he is stable and serious in handling matters!</p>
<p>The City Government's New Initiatives - Main Content</p>
<p>In fact, although Mayor Ouyang has never announced his new plan, according to the reporter's investigation from all sides, all municipal construction is indeed actively underway. The important contents are roughly the following:</p>
<p>(1) Reorganizing the Disaster Area and Restoring Construction: Because Guangzhou has experienced eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the disaster area is vast, resulting in a more serious housing shortage. Now the Land Administration Bureau has a complete plan to thoroughly reorganize, remeasure the disaster area, delineate boundaries, and submit it to the Urban Construction Committee for review and approval within a short period of time, and then announce it to each original owner for claiming and reconstruction. If the owners are unable to build, the government will first raise funds for construction, and after the disaster area is restored and prosperous, the owners will share the reimbursement. After this plan is successful, not only will the housing shortage problem be solved, but the prosperity of the city will be increased a hundredfold.</p>
<p>(2) Developing the Xicun and Henan Industrial Zones: Since the restoration, Guangzhou's industry has been in a slump due to foreign goods dumping, lack of raw material sources, and high wages, and the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. Therefore, the authorities are now formulating a plan to designate Xicun as a heavy industrial zone and Henan as a light industrial zone, and encourage overseas Chinese to invest and set up businesses, and will give them considerable protection. If it is realized, the city's production and construction can be increased, and the unemployed people can also be relieved, and society will be more stable.</p>
<p>(3) Developing Shipping and Opening the Inner Port: Guangzhou is a transportation port in South China, and there are more and more ships coming and going. It is now actively carrying out the opening of the inner port to facilitate the development of shipping on various rivers, and it is estimated that it will be completed within six months.</p>
<p>(4) Separately Reorganizing Public Utilities: Public utilities in Guangzhou, such as electric lights, telephones, and tap water, have never been perfect, as mentioned above. Now, because the city government's application to the Central Bank for a loan of 10 billion has been successful, and 4 billion yuan has been allocated to improve water and electricity, it is now being actively reorganized separately. At the same time, transportation is also being improved. The promotion of tricycles has also received considerable results, and the continued construction of roads and the improvement of streets are all being actively planned.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese's Large Investment in Guangdong</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there is also better news, that is, recently, overseas Chinese in the Nanyang archipelago and Singapore have voluntarily invested heavily in Guangzhou's construction projects. Initiated and raised by overseas Chinese leaders in Singapore, the initial estimated amount is 150 billion yuan. Their plans have also been formulated, preparing to build 26 of the latest model large markets with equipment in various districts of the city, and to build three wharves in the Henan Inner Port that can berth 10,000 to 15,000-ton ships, and three new-style large warehouses. The drawings of the various buildings are now being actively prepared. If this plan can be realized, these 26 markets alone are estimated to be able to solve the business and livelihood problems of more than 100,000 street vendors, and the appearance of the city will also be renewed at that time!</p>
<p>Indeed, all municipal construction after Guangzhou's system change is being actively planned and carried out! Because Mayor Ouyang is a practical person. We should believe that building a new Guangzhou will not just be a slogan!</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Clarification</p>
<p>Lovers are cousins but cannot be married</p>
<p>This newspaper's reader, Mr. Zhen Shayun, wrote in a letter. His friend, Mr. Huang, is very loyal and usually taciturn. He is now approaching the age of thirty, but recently, he has been frowning all day long. After inquiring again and again, he learned that Mr. Huang fell in love with his cousin during last year's summer vacation. The seeds of love were deeply buried, and they discussed marriage with each other. However, due to traditional teachings, it is almost impossible for the two to get married. Therefore, he is depressed and unhappy. Mr. Zhen also raised several legal questions as follows: (1) Is there any explicit legal provision on marriage between cousins? Mr. Huang and his cousin are cousins of the same lineage. Can they be allowed to marry as an exception? (2) Suppose they proceed with the marriage regardless of legal restrictions, is it illegal? Can others accuse Mr. Huang of inducement or other crimes? (3) If both parties are adults and get married, can others hinder them? (4) Cousins and relatives by marriage have the same bloodline. Why do people today support marriage between relatives by marriage but oppose marriage between cousins?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin's answer] (1) Article 983 of the Civil Code stipulates that direct relatives by marriage and collateral relatives by blood shall not marry. (2) The marriage is legally invalid, and the legal representative may file a lawsuit with the court to revoke the marriage if it violates Article 980 of the Civil Code. (3) Others have no right to interfere. (4) The law also restricts marriage between collateral blood relatives of the same generation within eight degrees of kinship, except for cousins.</p>

<h3>Four Suggestions for Maritime Safety</h3>
<p>Editor: I am a reader of your newspaper who travels between Shanghai and Chongming Island and must take ships. Seeing the sinking of the Datat Transportation ship, I feel a sense of danger and cannot remain silent. I have a few suggestions that I hope the authorities will adopt: (1) The competent authorities should regularly inspect machinery. If it does not meet navigation standards, the business should be ordered to suspend operations immediately and resume only after improvements are made. (2) The number of tickets sold should be based on the ship's tonnage and must not be exceeded. Violators should be prosecuted according to the law. (3) More life-saving equipment should be provided. (4) Crew members must be tested, as the Datong ship crew's failure to recognize warning flags led to the disaster. The lesson of the past is not far off, and misfortunes are frequent. Please pay attention. (Chen Zhi Chang, Yangshupu Road)</p>

<h3>A Letter Answering Readers: On the New Literary Thought Trend of China</h3>
<p>— Zhao Qing Ge</p>
<p>Mr. Rong:</p>
<p>Shen Zhan forwarded your letter and another letter from Mr. Rangzhe. Your contents are similar. You are not only concerned about me but also about the dynamics of China's new literary thought trend. This moves me very much because you are so enthusiastic about literature! In order not to disappoint your enthusiasm, I am willing to correspond with you even in this humid and hot weather. But this is not my laziness. To avoid writing separate letters to you, I am hereby responding publicly in a comprehensive way. It may seem disorganized, but the theme will not go beyond the realm of "literature."</p>
<p>You said that the development history of China's new literary thought trend in the past thirty years seems to have been lifted and carried by European and American literary thought trends, from Oscar Wilde's aestheticism to Emile Zola, Guy de Maupassant, Honore de Balzac's naturalism and realism, to the new romanticism and new realism of recent New Russia. I do not deny that this series of changes in literary thought trends has indirectly and successively influenced the evolution of China's new literary thought trend; but I can deny that they are the authority that "lifted and carried" the evolution of China's new literary thought trend. We know that the changes in European and American literary thought trends are also driven by the mainstream of global thought. China's new literary thought trend is also directly driven and evolved under such a law, adapting to the needs of the times. How can the influence of European and American literary thought trends alone be effective? From this, we should understand that the new literary thought movement in China in the past thirty years is independent and not promoted by European and American literary thought trends. To speak more broadly, Don Quixote, a famous European work of the early 18th century, is still a literary masterpiece, as you said, and the Yuan dynasty Chinese writer Shi Nai'an had already written the masterpiece "Water Margin," which reflects the social conditions and people's thoughts of the time, and has been circulating to this day. At that time, it could not be said to be influenced by European and American literary thought trends! It was a product of that era, proving that China's literary thought trend had independently laid the foundation for evolution hundreds of years ago. Therefore, I must ask you to recognize that China's literary thought trend has its own splendid history and its evolution is natural and not opened up or even "lifted and carried" by European and American literary thought trends. Especially after World War II, the entire world's thought evolved from capitalism and powerism to democracy, and the literary thought trend also leaped to democracy. The credit for promoting the awakening of the world lies in China's War of Resistance against Japan. Therefore, we can say that the latest historical page in the evolution of world literary thought trends was revealed by China.</p>
<p>As for what you said about the quantity and quality of Chinese literary works expressing literary thought trends, it is still only an "infant less than a month old," I admit that, especially today when the world war has just ended and is still catching its breath. Chinese literature is waiting to be revived and constructed, and it is also in the midst of domestic turmoil. It has never been easy for Chinese literary writers to write in a difficult living environment. Now the living environment is even more difficult, with double oppression of material and spirit, unlike European and American literary writers, whose countries provide them with life security and the right to freely express their thoughts. Then, I ask, what conditions can a poor Chinese literary writer rely on to produce literary works that satisfy themselves and others? I am not trying to protect or quibble for Chinese literary writers, this is a fact! I dare say that if Upton Sinclair and Romain Rolland were born in China, no matter how talented they were, they would probably not be able to produce works like those they produced in Europe and America. Therefore, most Chinese literary writers are now passive; although there are a few who are still struggling and fighting with reality, they are ultimately weak and insufficient to accomplish the great cause of revival and construction. Naturally, this should be sad, but this is by no means the fault of literary writers. At present, literary writers have become sentimental and melancholy and cannot write good works. In order to make a living, they have to write, so they only write about things that are far from reality, such as drawing materials from history (like the performance of today's dramas, almost all of which are historical remakes), or tracing back some personal memories. I am such a literary writer. Therefore, three months ago, I received a letter from a reader in Peiping, who questioned why I only write sentimental works and advised me to write more articles that people need, that is, the voice representing the suffering of the people, and inject a cardiotonic into the people. I have not replied to this letter to this day. I know that he will misunderstand that I do not accept his good intentions and care, and he will be even more disappointed. But, how could he know how ashamed and mixed up I felt after reading his letter! How can I reply to him? Can I lie that I am not sentimental? I am sentimental! Can I promise him that I can write works that the people demand? But the environment will not allow me to write. So I can only not reply to the letter. I always remember the kindness of that reader. Although the things I write now have no content and are not active enough to express the evolution of literary thought trends, I am willing to swear to the readers who care about me that I will be loyal to literature and never be sloppy or crude in writing skills; I will never relax the pursuit of truth in the theme consciousness; and I will never abandon the banner of justice. Am I a purely literary worker of humanistic thought and liberalism? I would never dare to deceive myself or deceive the readers who care about me; because I admire literature, I live for literature! Not only me, many literary writers today are working and living in this state!</p>
<p>Now let us return to the topic and talk about the brief history of the development of China's new literary thought trend in the past thirty years and the trend of China's new literary thought trend today. But first, I would like you to establish a sense of self-esteem for Chinese literature and believe that the history of Chinese literary thought trend has its own evolving historical background and its own independent life. It was like this in the past, and it will still be like this in the future. It will never be simply transferred by the influence of European and American literary thought trends!</p>
<p>From the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919; to the "September 18th" Incident in 1925; to the "July 7th" War of Resistance in 1937; to the "September 3rd" victory in 1945, in this not short twenty-six years, Chinese new literature was influenced by internal and external politics, economy, society, and culture; literary thought trends have gone through these epoch-making historical evolutions, and have generated an undeniable driving force for the country and the people.</p>
<p>We can roughly divide the new Chinese literature of the past thirty years into three stages:</p>
<p>(1) The first stage - the "emerging literature" stage of anti-feudalism. The time is during the "May Fourth" Movement. Representative figures who advocated emerging literature were Mr. Hu Shi, Mr. Chen Duxiu, and Mr. Cai Yuanpei.</p>
<p>(2) The second stage - the "revolutionary literature" stage of anti-imperialism. The time is around the "September 18th" Incident. Representative figures who led the "revolutionary literature" were Mr. Lu Xun, Mr. Guo Moruo, Mr. Mao Dun, and Mr. Lao She.</p>
<p>(3) The third stage - the "national defense literature" stage of resisting the enemy and saving the nation, also known as the "national literature" stage. The time is during the "July 7th" War of Resistance. Representative figures who led the "national defense literature" were the national literary writers who participated in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>These three stages have never left the door of struggle. Chinese literature has blossomed, borne fruit, and shone brilliantly in the process of these historical struggles! Literature lacking struggle has no vitality, that is, no center of gravity. Literature progresses and grows in struggle, and it is still like this now. The nature of this struggle, whether it is subjective - for the literary cause itself; or objective - for human society; its motivation belongs to a sense of justice. The worship of justice in literature is almost natural! Therefore, struggle becomes a necessary condition for literature. (The so-called "sense of justice" is just a pure and kind spiritual sense, not any political means. Some people say that a sense of justice is "left-leaning," which is really absurd. In fact, it is a moderate and upright attitude towards life that is neither left nor right.)</p>
<p>Under this general principle of struggle for "justice," literary thought trends are superficially "unified," but due to the different individual positions and concepts and the understanding of the times, there are constantly narrow and fragmented divisions and factions. This phenomenon is very obvious in each of the above three stages, and there is no special development. After the War of Resistance, various factions and gangs automatically disappeared. Under the call of the truth of resisting the enemy and saving the nation in the national literary circles, they unanimously united on one front. For eight years, literary writers have been shedding blood like armed comrades - their heart's blood. Coupled with the attack of poverty and disease, many lives have been sacrificed (whether they died in battle, in bombing, or from lung disease). But this is not enough to make literary writers depressed. Everyone is willing to vomit the last drop of their blood, and no one will be threatened by thousands of germs! Why? Because everyone has only one concept: that is, the country is supreme and the nation is supreme!</p>
<p>Thank God, the war is finally over. Literature and the world, like China, have been destroyed by the flames of war, and everyone is calling for revival! The trend of this great era guides the world and China together towards a peaceful construction mainstream. What is the peaceful construction mainstream? It is democracy! Democracy is a progressive strategy through the collective consciousness of all mankind! Its philosophical basis is the generosity of benevolence, righteousness, and morality. Selflessness is to synthesize the opinions of the majority, objectively identify them, and take their essence to replace them. Its ideology is transcendent, free, and only good and beautiful. Today, the world and China need unity, and democracy produces unity. Without unity, there is no way to be democratic. Conversely, without democracy, there is naturally no way to unite.</p>
<p>Literary thought trends change with today's political, economic, social, and cultural background. Under the driving force of a progressive world view, they undoubtedly tend towards transcendence and freedom. Whether it is for the literary cause itself or for human society, literature needs to promote a truly free ideological emotion. Express the basic spirit of democracy from the cultivation of learning and morality. The highest ideal of this basic spirit is the maintenance of justice and humanity. Therefore, democratic literature does not allow its thought trends to have fragmented phenomena again. Any existence of literary factions and the establishment of portals should be swallowed by the waves of the new era! Otherwise, literature will not be able to set off the power of its new life, nor will it be able to reflect objective reality, and generate a role in promoting the future evolution of politics, economy, society, and culture! Therefore, today's new literary thought trend can be called the "democratic literature" stage of peaceful construction.</p>
<p>Democratic literature should be the sign of the consciousness of today's literary writers. Literary writers should hold transcendent integrity and regard the free and democratic literary cause as the peaceful construction cause of the whole world and all mankind; and express the highest theme of their works from the wise pen of the writer. However, at this stage, literary writers must abandon the concept of position, grasp objective reality, truth is discovered, literature can get a new evaluation, literary revival will inevitably succeed, and the literary cause will inevitably radiate the most brilliant light eternally in history!</p>
<p>Dear reader, I don't know if you are satisfied with this reply to your question about the brief history of the development of China's new literary thought trend and the future direction of China's new literary thought trend? Simplicity may be inevitable, but please believe that I am very objective and sincere! I hope this letter can help you understand the natural formation of the evolution of China's new literary thought trend and its relationship with European and American literary thought trends more deeply. As for whether my personal views and analysis are correct, I am willing to discuss them again. I have absolutely no prejudice.</p>
<p>I will stop here. Thank you to all readers for your love and concern! (Night of 15th, July, 36th Year)</p>
<h3>Psyche</h3>
<p>— Edward John Poynter</p>
<p>Edward John Poynter (1836-1919) specialized in watercolor paintings and murals, and served as the curator of major British art galleries. In 1896, he was appointed as the President of the Royal Academy.</p>
<p>The background and facial expressions of Psyche in this painting are captivating. Legend has it that Psyche was the wife of Cupid, the son of the goddess Venus. She loved Cupid, but was unwilling to obey him. Eventually, she could not bear the pain and reconciled with him. This picture depicts Psyche's psychology. (Xu Junmo)</p>
<h3>The Book Market in America</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The number of literary publications published in the United States every month is countless, and we really have no way to introduce them all, because most of them are still authors and works that have not been eliminated by time. Rather than talking about them, I would rather introduce some recent literary histories, literary theories, and reprints and analyses of literary masterpieces.</p>
<p>Sheed &amp; Ward bookstore is preparing to publish a set of "Great Writers of the World." Each book will have a biography, textual evidence (including new translations), the era in which the writer lived, and his influence on the future. The first two types, "Horace" of Rome and "Boccaccio" of Italy, have been published, and "Rabelais," "Dante," and "Maupassant" will be published soon.</p>
<p>Freud's "Leonardo da Vinci" is now available in English translation. "The Selected Works of Stevenson" contains 1,200 pages, including short and long novels, essays, and poems, and each piece has no abridgments. These two books are published by Random House.</p>
<p>The University of Chicago Press has published a new translation of Pindar's short songs, and also published Richard M. Kain's "Fabulons Voyager." The latter specializes in explaining James Joyce's "Ulysses." We should not regard "Ulysses" as a mysterious work, it is just a human experience. Some critics scold this book for being obscene, and some praise his style, but neither can truly understand this modern "Divine Comedy." Kain pointed out symbols in the book that have never been pointed out before, and found that the author was actually attacking the failure of civilized morality.</p>
<p>Sidney Cox wrote a book "Indirections," which is a book about writing. The author has rich experience and knowledge, penetrating humanity, and the writing is also profound. The book has received unanimous praise after it was published. Published by Alfred A. Knopf bookstore.</p>
<p>Northrop Frye wrote a book "Fearful Symmetry," published by Princeton University Press. This is a monograph on William Blake, which can answer the author's poems. The author describes Blake's thoughts and poetry, and describes his religious views, views on life, and artistic views, the complex symbols in his poems, his relationship with contemporary British literature, and the true meaning of his poems.</p>
<p>John Gassner's "Best Plays of Modern American Theatre" has released its second collection, with seventeen complete scripts, beginning with an introduction that describes the development of American drama from 1939 to 1946, and each writer also has a biography and reference materials.</p>

<h3>Two Topics in Essays</h3>
<p>— Shi Jimei</p>
<p>Backstage</p>
<p>The embroidered curtain is slowly falling, and the touching music is sending the audience away.</p>
<p>A good show ended like this.</p>
<p>A friend invited me to visit the back together, and I happily agreed.</p>
<p>The carved railings and jade砌 buildings were originally these unshaped blocks and pieces of cloth? The magnificent flowers, trees, mountains, and forests were originally these colored papers and powder paintings? And that face with the greasepaint not yet wiped off, under the lights of the dressing room, is so ugly! Just now, the stage was also lit up, how beautiful and solemn it was?</p>
<p>Everything is different, but is it just these?</p>
<p>Look: that couple in love is now arguing about the "grabbing of words" just now, arguing until their faces are red; the filial son and loving mother in the play are also sulking for some reason; the good old man is scolding people; the naive girl is secretly flirting with the robber who robbed her in the play...</p>
<p>——So this is the backstage, how different!</p>
<p>I never thought that what was so beautiful in the front was so ugly in the back! I never thought...</p>
<p>Butterflies and Bees</p>
<p>Do you remember?</p>
<p>On a sunny day when birds sing and flowers are fragrant, bees are flying among the flowers, and butterflies are also flying among the flowers...</p>
<p>The butterfly said to the bee: "Play, take advantage of this golden spring."</p>
<p>The bee replied: "Because it is a golden spring, I cannot forget to brew honey."</p>
<p>"Good times don't last long, and good scenery is hard to repeat. You should remember to enjoy yourself in time."</p>
<p>"Good times don't last long, and good scenery is hard to repeat. I only know to work hard in time."</p>
<p>"One day, spring will be gone, and you will regret it."</p>
<p>"One day, spring will be gone, and you will regret it."</p>
<p>Truly one day: they met in another world.</p>
<p>"I wasted my youth." The bee regretted it.</p>
<p>"I wasted my youth." The butterfly also regretted it.</p>
<p>Dear, whether it is a butterfly or a bee, you can choose, you can arrange, but remember, in the future, don't regret it! Don't ever.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 355</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Everyone at my level at the time had tried this "Zen skill," but no one had succeeded. Others had different experiences; in short, each person had a unique approach and explanation. As for me, I tried three times and twice ended up in a deep sleep, losing half a day in the blink of an eye, almost delaying my exams and catching the night train.</p>
<p>However, after taking on a position, I often felt mentally exhausted. Occasionally, I remembered this trick and practiced it with determination for some time, indeed gaining some insight. Since collaborating with Tsurumi, this method has become my unfailing remedy for chapped hands, a small skill with great use (?), truly achieving some effect. I even taught this method to Tsurumi, who reportedly also experienced "scattered benefits."</p>
<p>However, since the day I moved to Shanxi to begin drawing up plans, until I reached Changping, I was so busy and distracted that I couldn't even practice this "Zen skill" on time. Therefore, that night, Ding Yuan and Big Fool persuaded me to rest, and I had no choice but to accept. But as soon as I closed my eyes, I heard Liu Wu come in and say, "It's broad daylight, a young guest has arrived and is waiting to see you."</p>
<p>I opened my eyes and asked if it was really broad daylight. However, I felt like I had only just closed my eyes, realizing I had slept so soundly that I didn't even notice how quickly time had passed.</p>
<p>"A young guest?" I immediately thought it must be Little Tiger. "Quick, show him in!" I waved to Liu Wu and jumped out of bed.</p>
<p>"Uncle!" Little Tiger didn't wait for Liu Wu to leave before running into the inner room. "Uncle, I'm here!"</p>
<p>Not seeing this child for a few days felt like years. I looked him up and down and thought he seemed a bit taller. Immediately, I realized this was just a perceptual illusion; because I constantly thought of him as a child of only twelve or thirteen years old, and children naturally can't be too tall—according to the average child's height—with this preconception, seeing him again after a few days made me feel like he had grown taller.</p>
<p>He was still wearing the same outfit—a short-sleeved, open-necked shirt and Western-style long trousers—the shirt was off-white, and quite dirty, likely having not been changed in days, making it appear quite ragged. The trousers, though Western-style, had no visible straight seams, and if it weren't for the few buttons, two pockets, and turned-up cuffs, no one would recognize them as suit trousers.</p>
<p>As for the shoes he wore, they had a sense of "Minar flaps" and "kick-a-cow" described in old novels. Although these were Minar flaps, they were indeed a pair of imitation imported basketball high-top boots. Because they were old and he had run so much, the laces had stretched and torn the holes, and he was too lazy to re-lace them, giving the top of the boot a flapped appearance. The "kick-a-cow" description also had some truth to it; the soles and toes of the shoes had been patched several times, nailed with thick leather; this savage look certainly seemed capable of kicking a cow to death.</p>
<p>Logically, as an officer in the city, even a minor lieutenant, he should have a "salary," rations, and equipment. Why couldn't he get a pair of military leather shoes? This is a valid question. Little Tiger had grown up in the north and never cared about his clothing. Furthermore, he simply didn't like leather shoes; "Too stiff, too slippery; simply doesn't feel right." I remember the night he first met Mr. W, he wore a pair of new leather shoes.</p>
<p>Shanghai Ramblings</p>
<h3>The Soldiers' Complaints</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>Once, on the tram, I bumped into a soldier due to the crowd. He reacted as if he had been electrocuted, his face turning red, clenching his fists, appearing ready to challenge me. He was very sturdy, and if he had started a fight, I would have immediately tasted his "leather fist," maybe even a couple of ear slaps. But I was versed in the "Confucian and Buddhist" ways of tolerance, and despite his repeated glares, I endured it to avoid trouble, and ultimately, a major disaster was averted.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when I discussed it with others, many said, "A hero doesn't suffer immediate losses," and it's best not to argue with them.</p>
<p>Another time, on the bus, when getting off, the pushing from behind caused me to accidentally bump into two well-dressed soldiers in front of me. After getting off the bus, they also had angry faces. One of them looked me up and down, as if trying to assess my status, clearly intending to start a fight. At that moment, I thought, "Status can actually deflect someone's fist?" This was unexpected.</p>
<p>After these two lessons, I became especially deferential to soldiers, because they are quick-tempered and easily angered. Although I don't intentionally offend them, even a slight carelessness turns me into their punching bag, which is a significant loss for me.</p>
<p>But later, after calming down and thinking about it, they have too many "complaints" in their lives, so I can't blame their rudeness. Especially in Shanghai's extravagant environment, it is a constant mockery and provocation to them. The dazzling and colorful nightlife of the city is truly irritating to them.</p>
<p>Moreover, many of them are brave warriors who have endured bloody battles. How can they not be angry when they see Shanghai's prosperity and wealth?</p>
<p>It's just like what Remarque wrote in "The Road Back," the returning soldiers are psychologically abnormal and unhealthy. They hate everything and complain about everything.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you encounter their hateful gaze or angry demeanor on the streetcar, you should be 100% calm and handle the situation accordingly.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes About Wedemeyer's Visit to China</h3>
<p>— Jiamu</p>
<p>During World War II, the highest-ranking American generals stationed in the Eastern and Western theaters were often more military organizers than battlefield commanders, and also military diplomats. Eisenhower in the West was such a figure, and General Wedemeyer, who came to China again, was also of this type.</p>
<p>General Wedemeyer's current position is due to his service in the China theater during the war. However, Churchill had an indirect role in sending General Wedemeyer to China, which is a very interesting historical anecdote.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer had studied in Germany and was an expert in German tactics. He was a valued member of Marshall's inner circle and originally an important staff member at Eisenhower's headquarters. During the Quebec Conference, Roosevelt and Churchill convened a meeting of senior generals to discuss the issue of opening up the Western theater. Churchill initially strongly opposed landing in France, saying that the risk of failure was too great, and that the strength of the British and American air forces would reach its peak in 1944. He argued that strategic bombing for a year would destroy all of Germany's industrial cities, and the war would inevitably end, but the cost of massive bloodshed could be avoided. Roosevelt and Marshall both opposed this view, and ultimately decided to discuss the technical problems of opening a second theater. Churchill, because his opinion was not adopted, insisted that if a landing in Western Europe were to happen, the United States would need to contribute 70% of the troops, while Britain could only contribute 30%, and angrily said: "I cannot waste the seed of the British Empire." At the time, Wedemeyer was present and opposed, arguing from the standpoint of "military science" that the ratio of British and American landing forces should be fifty-fifty, so that the second front could be opened in 1943. Otherwise, if the United States were to transport a large army to the British Isles, the losses due to submarine activity would be significant, and coupled with rest and training, the end of the war would be delayed by a year. Wedemeyer's views were supported by the American side, but Churchill stubbornly refused to budge. Finally, Roosevelt, for the sake of preserving the British-American alliance, accepted the British view. From then on, Churchill was quite wary of Wedemeyer, believing that having such a person at the Western European headquarters would be detrimental to the interests of the British Empire. Therefore, he chose an extremely appropriate opportunity to cleverly suggest to Roosevelt that Wedemeyer be sent to Mountbatten's headquarters as Deputy Chief of Staff. Churchill's intention was: the Southeast Asia theater was mainly a naval and air war, and Wedemeyer was an expert in German tactics, so sending him there would render him useless and prevent him from hindering Mountbatten's actions. However, things in the world are too changeable and unpredictable. After Stilwell left, due to Marshall's recommendation, Wedemeyer, based on his dual qualifications of having served in China in his youth and having diplomatic skills, was sent to China to take on a major responsibility on his own.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer's contributions during and after the war are well known. Here, I will briefly mention a couple of small matters to illustrate his ability to handle people. As soon as he arrived in China, he reversed Stilwell's arrogant attitude and strived to establish friendship with the Chinese authorities. Whenever he met with the Chairman, his tone and manner were always that of a Chinese Chief of Staff, rather than the Commander of the American Army. It is said that when he made suggestions to the Chairman, in addition to detailing the reasons and hoping for adoption, he also humbly said: "If you make a contrary decision, I will certainly obey." This good attitude preserved the self-esteem of the head of state, making it easier to promote all events. Chairman Chiang rarely attended private receptions for foreigners, but General Wedemeyer, while in Chongqing, actually managed to get the Chairman to make an exception and attend his evening meal, which he repeatedly declared to be his personal great honor. He had a high degree of sympathy for the Chinese people and leaders. On the eve of victory, he wrote an article published in the American Collier's magazine, objectively pointing out China's difficulties and ways to overcome them, and explaining to the outside world any misunderstandings of China. He was extremely dissatisfied with China's military supply system, advocating that American officers should handle supplies for China during the major counter-offensive. However, at the same time, he greatly praised the integrity and efforts of Chen Cheng, Yu Dawei, Lin Kesheng, and others, hoping that American criticism of China would not negate everything. These small actions, accumulated, made a considerable contribution to Sino-American friendship.</p>
<p>Here, I will end this article with a quote from a diplomatic figure: "Marshall's work in China needed someone to tidy up and finish it. Munitions and reinforcements are only a signal, and now Wedemeyer has finally come to tidy things up. In the Far East, the United States uses strategy to guide diplomacy; in Marshall, strategy and diplomacy are integrated, while Wedemeyer is in fact Marshall's representative."</p>
<h3>Reduced Printing Technique</h3>
<p>— Anyuan</p>
<p>The 24 massive volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica are only two inches thick.</p>
<p>The entire collection of the Harvard Library can be viewed in remote small places.</p>
<p>American scientists can request various books from the government for free when they need them, regardless of the language. This is envied by anyone who likes to study science but cannot afford books, but when you see the books they receive, you must be greatly surprised, because they are not ordinary books, but rather collections bound with cardstock, densely arranged with many black rectangles, the original twenty-seven thousand pages of the Encyclopedia Britannica are only two inches thick in one volume. At that time, you will definitely have the impression of "Can this be considered a book?" Do not be surprised! This is an important factor that has helped American science develop particularly rapidly during the war - reduced printing technique.</p>
<p>The reduced printing technique was invented by the American publisher Albert Boni after five years of effort. Each page of his medical prints requires many black blocks that are three-quarters of an inch long and half an inch wide, each black block is equivalent to a page of an ordinary book. To adapt to this kind of book, he also invented a reading machine called Readea, which looks like a typewriter. It is extremely convenient to read reduced books on the reading machine. Just pull out the narrow drawer at the bottom of the machine, insert the book, then turn the machine button, turn on the light inside the machine, and correct the focus. Then you can see a book the same size as an ordinary book on the transparent sheet on the top. You only need to raise your hand to turn the book page by page, or ten pages, or a hundred pages at a time.</p>
<p>This reading machine costs about one hundred and twenty US dollars, which is the biggest expense in reading reduced books. After that, you only need to pay five cents to buy an encyclopedia, and you can buy a complete collection of Greek and Roman classical literature for very little cost, while the market only has its fragments and excerpts. Lawyers, engineers, doctors, scholars, and specialists can see rare and precious works on their desks without going to the library. The world's largest Harvard Library, which contains almost all the knowledge in the world, can appear in every remote small town by using reduced printing technique. Therefore, people who have used reduced books all praise it as the greatest invention in printing.</p>
<h3>Miscellanea from America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>America's Honored Veterans</p>
<p>Where there is a country, there is war; where there is war, there are wounded soldiers. No, they should be called honored veterans. Honored veterans have contributed to the war of resistance and should be given preferential treatment by society, but society is cold and human feelings are snobbish. Honored veterans have become soldiers without weapons. Having lost a leg, they go door-to-door with crutches to solicit donations, even filing lawsuits. Where is the honor in that? The experience of American honored veterans is different. The death benefit is ten thousand dollars, and the disabled receive additional compensation. Veterans who are not injured or have recovered are welcomed back by the local people, and the government has stipulated several measures. Those who wish to study receive a monthly allowance of fifty dollars for tuition and fees, regardless of their previous rank. Those who wish to open farms or factories only need to submit detailed plans, and the government will provide start-up funds in unlimited amounts. Those who wish to purchase real estate can prepare drawings and 5% of the cash, while the remaining 95% can be borrowed from banks with extremely low interest rates through government guarantees. Those who wish to study abroad can be listed as exchange students and sent abroad. Those who do not wish to retire can serve for another three years. With the government treating honored veterans so well, who would not be loyal and patriotic, preparing for a third world war to stage another heroic scene? The government treats them as national heroes, and the soldiers repay the country as national heroes. Therefore, very few people desert in the American army. Think about it, to be a basic soldier, you have a base salary of fifty dollars, a family allowance of twenty-five dollars, a thirty-dollar allowance for the first child, and thirty-dollar allowances for the second and third children, plus meal allowances, housing allowances, and overseas allowances. You can earn more than two hundred US dollars a month. Where can you find such a good position? To be an honored veteran, you are guaranteed food and clothing at the very least. The American army is elite and not numerous. Training a soldier who can fight costs about 30,000 rounds of bullets alone. Adding the equipment and all the expenses during the training period, a soldier is worth about 100,000 US dollars. The fifty-dollar-a-month salary is just a drop in the bucket. The ten thousand dollar death benefit is just a small contribution. (25)</p>
<h3>The Prince of Fu's "Old Immortal Doctrine" – Recollections of a Chaotic Era, Part Two</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Wu Meicun said a few words about the Prince of Fu (who was also the Hongguang Emperor at the time) who ascended the throne in Nanjing in the "Lu Zhi Jibun":</p>
<p>"The world may say that the Prince of Fu read little, and could not personally decide on decrees, so that the inner eunuchs and outer retainers could rely on each other to commit fraud. In his usual eating, drinking, and feasting, he would run wildly in the palace gardens, as if he had lost his mind. As for male prostitutes, young girls, and using medicines to indulge in lust, all of these are exaggerations of hearsay. These words may be true. In short, he is like Liu Adou of the Han Dynasty. Even if Shi (Kefa) and Gao (Hongtu) and other gentlemen were in court, it would be difficult to assist him; let alone Ma (Shiying) and Ruan (Dacheng)?"</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve of the year Yi Si, the Prince of Fu was in the Xingning Palace, and was unhappily happy. The eunuch Han Zanzhou entered the room and said, "The new palace should be joyful, but the emperor seems to be somewhat unhappy, does he miss his late father?" The Prince of Fu did not respond, and then said, "There are too few good actors in the pear garden." Before this time, there was a rumor in Nanjing that "There are secretaries everywhere, governors are walking all over the streets, censors are as many as sheep, and officials are as cheap as dogs. The legacy of a thousand years is unearthed, and a tribute student presents his head, sweeping away the threads of Jiangnan to fill the mouths of the Ma family." On the one hand, the Qing soldiers were pressing forward, and the four garrisons were fighting among themselves. Zuo Liangyu stationed troops in Jiangzuo, and fought with Ma Shiying endlessly. In addition, there was a severe drought in Jiangnan, and it did not rain for several months. Gentlemen like Gao Antu had all resigned from politics. Everywhere one looked, there was an atmosphere of national demise. However, on the other hand, "The prime minister only loves money, and the emperor only drinks wine." What is even worse is that "Grand Secretary Gao Hongtu was dismissed, and Ma Shiying replaced him as the chief grand secretary. The Prince of Fu listened with his hands clasped in front of him, and lived in the forbidden palace, taking pleasure only in performing miscellaneous dramas, drinking spirits, and ravishing young girls. The people called him the Old Immortal." And the overlord believed in it so thoroughly that on that New Year's Eve, he was still a little "unhappily happy", leaving behind the humorous and witty saying: "There are too few good actors in the pear garden."</p>
<p>Wu Meicun said that the Prince of Fu was a Liu Adou, and his mediocrity was real. However, the licentiousness and lust were too exaggerated by hearsay. However, the historical records contain a memorial from the official Chen Zilong:</p>
<p>"Recently, eunuchs have been sent out in all directions. If a woman in the folk has any beauty, she is selected into the palace with a yellow paper pasted on her forehead, causing a disturbance in the neighborhoods. Please issue a prohibition."</p>
<p>When the Qing army had broken Haozhou and Dorgon led his troops to Huai'an, the situation became increasingly urgent. However, the Southern Capital was still busy with the selection of beautiful women.</p>
<p>"A woman surnamed Ruan was selected from seventy people, a niece of Dacheng. In addition, fifty beautiful women were sent from Zhejiang, and one surnamed Wang and one surnamed Zhou were selected, and all were sent to the palace prison."</p>
<p>In such a year, unexpectedly, Grand Marshal Ruan Dacheng still wanted to be the emperor's father-in-law. Although this was one of the means by which courtiers flattered and pleased, it is likely not an "inaccurate rumor" that the Fu Lord was quite interested in "ravishing young girls" amidst the sound of cannons.</p>
<p>What made the Prince of Fu dare to face the Qing soldiers without moving was his "Old Immortal Doctrine" – performing miscellaneous dramas, drinking spirits, and ravishing young girls, after all, were more interesting than handling state affairs.</p>
<p>However, the good times did not last long. Finally, the false prince case occurred. The Prince of Fu was naturally more anxious than anyone else, so he moved the false prince to Nanjing and imprisoned him, determined to put him to death! Otherwise, "How can I deal with myself?" The Jiangshan was already only this much under the swords of the Qing soldiers, and could not be divided, nor was it willing to be divided again. Moreover, if the other party was really the prince, he would have to abdicate. Being able to divide the family would still be a great blessing. Therefore, on other political struggles, "he only loved to drink wine", and was inevitably confused. He had his "Old Immortal Doctrine". When it came to the life-and-death moment of fighting for the throne, he seemed very shrewd and became a thorough man of the world. He was afraid that a real prince would suddenly appear, similar to the situation after the Southern Song Dynasty, when Gaozong did not want the two emperors to return south.</p>
<p>However, although he tremblingly did a few years as an emperor who "only loved to drink wine", with the support of Ma Shiying, Ruan Dacheng and others, he was still able to taste the flavor of the life of a surrendered lord of the "dynasty". After being captured, he was interrogated by Dorgon, and then ended in loneliness. It seems that it was because he lost the conditions of life that he could not adhere to his "Old Immortal Doctrine".</p>
<h3>Illusions of the End of the World</h3>
<p>— Binzhi</p>
<p>Two years ago, the first atomic bomb landed in Hiroshima, showing its great power. Scientists have been discussing its consequences; in particular, many astronomers worry that it will hinder the safety of the Earth and cause the world to tend towards destruction. What is this illusion of the end of the world like? In their imagination, one day the solar system will be destroyed by atomic energy, and the Earth will undergo drastic changes. It will be cremated in high heat, frozen by ice currents, or lose its balance of power with other planets, causing chaotic collisions that will destroy the Earth.</p>
<p>Fire has the greatest destructive power, and the devastation after the war is mostly a manifestation of fire. The Earth may be destroyed by the violence of the god of fire. The sun is affected by atomic energy, and its volume slowly expands due to internal changes. It will be three times larger than the current sun, and its heat will also increase. The temperature on Earth will also rise to a point where it can melt metal, and everything will be destroyed by melting under the torment of high heat.</p>
<p>The firepower of meteorites may also destroy the Earth. Although there have been meteorites in the past, they were not very serious. Atomic energy may allow meteorites to increase in size and firepower, and fall in urban areas like New York. Millions of people, countless buildings, and everything else are surrounded by flames, and everything turns to ashes in an instant. If several meteorites fell in several major cities at the same time, wouldn't the world be destroyed in this way?</p>
<p>Although firepower has supreme power, the Earth cannot be without fire for a moment. If the Earth is shaken by atomic energy and goes out of orbit, leaving the sun a little further away. At that time, the Earth will be surrounded by glaciers and cold currents because it cannot get the sun's warmth, and it will be several times colder than the current Arctic or Antarctic. Everything is frozen, stiff, and the Earth is destroyed by depression.</p>
<p>After the solar system is destroyed, many planets have no orbits to follow, so they fly aimlessly in the vacuum of the universe. If a planet larger than the Earth flies close to the Earth, the people, objects, and everything that can be moved on Earth will be attracted by that planet and ascend to the sky during the day, dancing in the sky. This is not an illusion of the fairy world, but a prelude to a tragedy. They collide, destroy, and eventually tend towards destruction in mid-air.</p>
<p>If a planet smaller than the Earth approaches, there will also be terrible things happening. For example, if the moon intrudes within 8,000 miles of the Earth's orbit, the moon will be split by the Earth's gravity. When these countless fragments fall to the ground, everything on Earth will be destroyed. What remains are just fragments of the moon, like new moons.</p>
<p>Are the astronomer's words terrible? Miserable? But whether this scene will happen, let's see the facts in the future. (Illustration of a scene of the end of the world)</p>
