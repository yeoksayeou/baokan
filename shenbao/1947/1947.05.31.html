<h3>立院推定委員九人　商疏導學潮辦法　胡適之在平談學生運動</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平卅日電〕北大校長胡適之，今日向外國記者發表談話稱，最近學生運動，如謂其係受共黨指使，此言似非公允。任何國家內，如對政治機構有所不滿，而又無民主方法可以發表其不滿之情緒，輒由靑年學生祖任政治運動，此普遍公式殆可適用於一切國家。中國自漢以來二千餘年之歷史，顯示學生運動與此公式相合，即如辛亥革命及後來之國民革命，均為一種學生運動，歐洲情形亦復如是，巴黎大學成立以來，從無一次政治運動非由學生領導，俄國革命亦由學生領導而起。今日之英，美則係例外，兩國皆有適當機構發表民意，靑年自可安心讀書遊息，不必作示威遊行，以求實行政治改革。全國學生現擬於六月二日舉行反內戰大遊行，北平屆時或可避免發生衝突，但亦不無危險。今日之學生運動，罷課遊行不能獲得任何解決，和戰均屬雙方之事，問題複雜，似非學生所能瞭解。如學生認為應當參加政治，則宜離開學校，積極置身於政治塲中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕立法院卅日晨舉行臨時會議，討論學潮問題時，曾通過如下兩項臨時動議：（一）孫九錄等提，由大會推定立委若干人，立即硏究疏導學潮辦法，即赴谷校勸導學生早日復課，一面並與政院保持聯繫，促即公正應允學生所提合理範圍以內要求案；決議，推陳顧遠，劉克　，傅統先，姜壽時，呂復，譚惕吾，孫九錄，夏濤聲，孫渠等九立委，即日研究疏導辦法，並開始工作。（二）陳海澄等提，建議由各地民意機關會同敎授勸導學生早日復髁，同時建議政府，於適當時期廢除維持社會秩序臨時辦法，並刷新政治案，決議，通過，將此項建議送交政府。立院通過上述決議後，劉克儁等委員當日曾開談話會，交換意見，日內接見學生代表，加以勸導，並聽取學生意見，轉達政府。</p>
<h3>朱敎長在立院答復學潮問題</h3>
<p>本敎育方法勸導復課</p>
<p>〔本報南京三十日電〕朱家驊三十日晨在立法院臨時會議席上答復有關學潮問題，略稱：此次學潮之發生原因，至為複雜，各校經費不足，設備不够，以致學生情緒不安，易受外來刺激，行動未能循乎正軌，故自學潮發生前後，本部即本敎育方法，諄諄開導，冀消弭於無形。關於中學會考及大學總考，均原有制度，今年會考公事係三月間發出，各地於凖備之際，適社會情形不甚安定，業准各省市敎育應局之要求，再展緩一年舉行。大學總考，創於抗戰時期，去年，今年皆因復員關係，各校依照實際情形，斟酌辦理。英大設校金華，係全國敎育善後復員會議之決議，根據敎育均衡發展原則而決定。交大問題泰半為訛傳誤會，其主要問題，乃在要求恢復航海，輪機兩科，就學校制度觀，殊不適宜。本人為應從上海地方當局之一再請求，乃批准其請。關於公費制度及公費生要求提高待遇問題，現公費生除有食米二斗，三升外，其副食費經已調整至四萬六千元一月，依目前米價計算，學生公費已達每月十二萬元以上（京滬等區），若必欲要求將副食費增至十萬元一月，不獨為國家財力所不勝負担，且不合理。本人獻身敎育工作，將達三十年，正如諸位先生所說，早歲亦曾參加靑年運動，對於學生心理，深為瞭解，故自學潮發生前後，即一本愛護靑年至意，迭派部中重要人員前往開導。自學潮發生以來，本部並經常約集各校校長及院系主任硏議籌商，勸導學生愛惜課業，從速復誤，凡一切勸導方法，無不第力為之。過去之處置如是，今後亦當一本此旨，妥謀平息；然靑年學生在求學時期，應以學業為重，政府愛護學生，正如家長之對其子弟，亦不應過事姑息。至若學生所感受之困難，本部在可能範圍，無不盡力為之解決，今後自當寬籌經費，更求改進，期使敎師安於敎，學生樂於畢，全國敎膏，均能在安定中求進步。</p>
<h3>中大學生簽名主張立即復課</h3>
<p>平鐵路學院六二復課</p>
<p>〔中央社南京卅日電〕中央大學行政會議於廿九日開會發表吿同學書後，該校學生甚為感動，已有大多數學生簽名，主張即行復課。</p>
<p>〔本報北平卅日電〕鐵路學院定六月二日復課，並由敎授，同學，校友陳聯席會，組織「復大委會」，並選出七人為委員，繼續向教部交涉。又北洋平部學生，原定今開大會決定復課日期，因出席不足半數，大會流產。</p>
<p>〔中央社開封卅日電〕河南大學復課事，學生·敎授及學校行政局三方面之意見日趨接近，學校方面廿九日下午商討復課問題，經決定即日由敎務處通知敎授會復課，是則復課一事指日可待。該校本屆畢業班學生二百餘名，要求在預定期間之六月二日（星期一）準時攷試，故學生復課亦可無問題</p>
<h3>京全市各中學愛國護學運動</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京三十日電〕市立五中學生，為「反對罷課，爭取續　自由」，發起愛國護學運動後，全市各中學紛起響應，業有三十餘校先後加入，於二十八日在淸凉山掃葉模正式成立「南京愛國護學學生聯合實」二十九日即積極展開宣傳工作，指出這次學潮是中共和民盟的陰謀底暴露，並發表宣言。三十日各校學生百餘人分乘卡車六輛，在市區作反罷課宣傳，甚得社會人士同情。又該會派代表於下午六時往謁參政會邵秘書長力子，呈遞上參政會書，提出具體意見如下：（甲）希望於政府者：（一）樹立清康的有效率的政治作風，痛下決心嚴懲貪汚。（二）對於各種決策與計劃，要說到做到。（三）立即採取澈底有效的辦法，挽救目前經濟危機。（四）對維持社會秩序，保障人民安全的法令，應切實執行。（五）對為害國家民族的叛黨，應明令戡討，以安民心。（六）重視敎育文化，增加經費。（乙）希望於中共者：（一）迅速放棄暴亂政策，停止所謂「三罷一慘」。（二）實踐「反對內戰的口號，停止叛變，還軍於國。」（三）議學生·工人·晨人有安靜的學校，工廠和農村。（四）放棄鬥爭·暗殺·淸算等兇殘的手段，成為一個眞正的政黨。（五）不要强姦民意，作含血噴人或無稽造謠的宣傳。（六）停止一切富於煽動性，破壤性的政爭方式。（七）認淸自己是黃帝的子孫。</p>

<h3>立院討論情形　學生代表一人列席旁聽</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕立院卅日晨舉行臨時會議，討論學潮問題，孫兼院長主席。出席立委共百餘人，朱家驊，張厲生，董顯覺國列席答問。學生方面亦有代表一人列席，張羣則因事未蒞院，會中各立委對當前學潮處理辦法，曾提建設性建議多項，盼能善為疏導，對封閉報事，亦曾提及並盼早日啓封，或將該案由軍事處分移司法機關法辦。</p>
<p>今日首起發言之立委為陳顧遠，渠除任立委職外，兼課上海復大，對學潮眞相殊熟悉。陳認為處理學潮，最佳莫過於疏導，並舉出三種最起碼之辦法，（一）重視敎授勸導辦法，蓋敎授思想容有不同，然對國家咸有責任感，學生對之亦有信仰，較田校長出面勸導更為有效；（二）由政府請與各校有關人士及知各之士，如參政員，立委等赴校宜導，（三）學生過問政治，於法並無不合，根據憲法，年滿廿三歲之國民，即有被選為立監委之權，政府應准學生於合法範圍內有權過問政治。</p>
<h3>請有聲望人士開誠布公勸導</h3>
<p>繼起發言者為兼任上海聖約翰大學敎授之傳統先，傅氏指出學生運動可分三個階段，今後處置，在消極方面，「維持社會秩序臨時辦法」似以撤消為宜；積極方面，最好以疏導替代壓力，由政府請有聲望之公正開明人士，開誠布公與學生懇談，民初之國會議員呂復，指出敎育行政不同於其他行政，只許積極，不許消極，盼當局以後一切措施，能多多注意積極性行動。至學潮問題，古今中外在所難免，貴在因勢利導，張皇操切無補於事，徒增紛擾，盼能愼重將事，勿再令珠江路事件重演。</p>
<p>鍾天心沉痛指出此次學潮有其政治性，然學生並未提出反政府口號，足證對政府尙未絕望，對共黨亦不抱多大希望，應付學潮有兩點値得考慮：（一）對非政治性要求合理者應予採納，（二）對政治性要求，盼能組代表團赴中共區呼籲和平，若能因此實現，固全國人民所願，若仍無結果，則誰要和平，誰無意和平，亦可大白於世。陳茹言亦認為學潮主要原因為政治，盼政府能起革命領　作用。程元斟指出，國民政府　與學生有不可分離之關係，而今日學生較廿年前者尤為可愛，其所提正當要求，應設法予以滿足。靑年黨立委夏濤聲等則認解決當前學潮最有效之辦法，為各黨派退出學校。</p>
<p>會中各立委對三報被封事，亦提出質詢，呂復以法律觀點，認當局此一處置，有需待斟酌之處。譚惕吾認封報館前何不先予警吿。陳顧遠指出，上海頒布戒嚴令，應經立院追認。周一志希望對此事能由軍事處置改為司法處置。</p>
<p>各立委今日發言侃侃而談當年趙家樓，天安門故事，而年輕廿歲之學生代表，則坐於昔年學生運動領袖朱部長之左側，同受質詢，空氣雖嚴重，然就歷史觀點言，誠不失為一有趣對照。</p>
<h3>參政會繼續舉行大會　今審查和平提案　高利吸收遊資案已取消</h3>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕參政會卅一日起舉行大會，開始討論提案，審查工作於卅日晚完畢，四五五案全部審查完竣。對於審查和平問題及有關提案之特種審查委員會，則定卅一日下午八時舉行，參政員中凡未參加特種審查委會之參政員，均得自由參加審查工作。大會議程預定三日，自卅一日始至六月二日閉幕，每日上下午分別舉行會議，大會秘書處業於卅日通知全體參政員，如以案件過多，不及於預定日期內完畢，可能延長之。</p>
<p>〔本報南京卅日電〕參政會卅日審查會中，審議以高利吸收遊資一案時，爭辯甚烈，錢新之謂：如將國家銀行利息提高至一角以上，則黑利亦即可能高過二角，三角，且如此利上加利，國家支出益增，通貨膨脹，遊資亦定加多，故不僅高利辦法不可行，即近傳發行高科短期庫券，亦同一不妥，結果該案遂被打銷。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京三十日電〕行政院長張羣今日向聯合社記者發表談話稱：「政府願意談判和平，祇須中共具有誠意：第一，應放棄恢復去年一月十三日軍事地位及取消憲法之要求，第二，應同意恢復交通。經濟情形之改善，繫於交通之恢復，即使內戰不停，仍望恢復交通，以减輕經濟危機」。張氏並稱，津浦路交通幾已恢復至冀魯邊界，現在共軍手中之一段，不久亦可由政府控制。中共雖在東北採取大規模攻勢，惟局勢並不甚惡，至於國軍是否將收復共軍佔據各點，則係軍略問題。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民盟梁漱滇氏日前由京來滬，卅日對記者談稱，國共之爭，本質上係一文化的衝突。政治之根本在文化，惟有大家對間題作根本的了解，從深處檢討，放棄粗淺浮躁的態度，國共始有接近之可能。梁氏又謂，參政會呼聲和平，已吿失敗。梁氏定今晚返京，出席參政會後，三日離京返渝。渠現正從事「中國文化之特徵」一書之著作，該書尚幣五個月始克完成。</p>

<h3>謝冰心向青年團員　講述日本觀感</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京卅日電〕名作家謝冰心女士，前自日本返國，出席參政會，廿九日晚七時，對靑年團團員二千餘人，講述日本觀感。大意如次：</p>
<p>衣食住都困苦</p>
<p>我到東京後，才知道東京被戰爭破壞的程度，要在重慶千倍以上。下午八時後，馬路上人的影子，也很難看見。目前東京房荒很嚴重，原來房子燒了，一部份炸了，一部份留下，比較整齊的，又給盟軍征用了，因此日本平民，往往八口之家，皆擠在一間方席的小屋子裏，又因爲有些人，住在鄕下，所以行也成了問題，地下鐵道，常常擠死人，食的方面很貧乏，向館子裏買食物，十次有九次買不到。說到衣，日本的天皇，在五月三日出來，接受民衆歡呼的時候，所穿的西裝，就陳舊不堪；一般敎授和學生，衣衫襤褸的，如果有一雙比較像樣的鞋子，也要到見貴賓的時候，才捨得穿。</p>
<p>婦女可愛可悲</p>
<p>日本婦女最可愛，也最可悲，在家庭裏沒有地位，社會上政治上，也是如此。日本著名婦女刋物之主婦之友「婦人公論」，都由男人主編，有幾個女議負，來向我獻花獻菓，是男議員同了來的我問她們什麼話，完全由男議員代他們回答。我認識一個家庭，先生留英，太太留美，都是讀的政治，他們在家裏，除了柴米油鹽之外，從沒有交換過關於學問上的話，在麥克阿瑟的管制之下，日本學制，已改爲小學六年，中學六年，大學四年的六六四制，所有大學都開放招考女生，而男生居然不大贊成，這就和我們中國五四時代不同，五四時代，一方面女子要求受敎育的機會均等，同時男子也非常熱心這一運動。</p>
<p>青年天眞活潑</p>
<p>學生們都很天眞活潑，我在西京（即京都）的國立大學裏演講的時候，發現他們有很多能說極流利的中國普通話，簡直使你分不淸楚究竟是中國人，還是日本人，一問起來，才知道他們根本沒有來過中國，只是在外國語學校讀了四年中國語文而已。現美國靑年和英國靑年，和日本靑年間正展開一種通信運動，以建立良好的友情。日本靑年，很希望中國靑年能和他們多多通信，交換出版的刊物。我接談到很多敎授，他們不但學識豐富，並且極有禮貌，始終很留意的聽你講話，很肅靜，很安詳，就是吃飯的時候，也是如此，這也許是他們多吃了魚的關係，因爲魚是沒有聲音的（全塲大鼓掌）。</p>
<p>華僑待遇很好</p>
<p>華僑現在在日本的待遇，當然要比戰前好，許多配給，也特別優待，中國駐日本的軍事代表團，比駐任何國的使館址都要大，一共分軍事，政治，經濟，敎育，文化四組，辦公的人，有一百多個，連眷屬以及工人總數在二百人以上，生活在一起，成爲一個有機體，大家很愉快，很親愛，住了那座房子很大，有大禮堂，我們要到什麽地方去，也很方便，汽車和吉普車，儘我們用。</p>
<p>缺乏有為領袖</p>
<p>我認爲日本之所以到現在這般地步，是沒有一個有爲的領袖，我們呢，現在要由愛的力量，來愛護他們，就好像原諒一個做錯了事的小弟弟一樣，原諒他們，因爲究竟中國和日本是同文同種，他們現在稍有一點頭腦的人，對中國都很仰慕，很感激。</p>
<p>走向民主復興</p>
<p>有許多人怕日本復興，這是不對的，應該怕的，是我們自己不復興。日本雖然受了戰事的重大創傷，目前碱，糖，油，鹽，這些生活上的必需品，都缺乏，但是在麥克阿瑟的扶助之下，畢竟開始一步一步走向民主與復興的道途了。回顧我們自己，我心裏萬分難受。</p>
<p>交通是道樣困難，我下次回國，也不定是一年之後，還是兩年之後，希望那時候的中國，已經是民主的統一的富强康樂的中國。</p>

<h3>生活指數「解凍」的後果</h3>
<p>各方所期望的生活指數「解凍」，已於昨日經本市生活指數審議委員會公布了。計本市本月份工人總指數爲二萬三千五百三十四倍，照二萬三千五百倍計算，職員總指數爲一萬六千三百五十七倍，照一萬六千四百倍計算。這些數字，與一月份的工人總指數七千九百四十六倍，和職員總數六千六百十四倍相比，上騰幾達三倍。我們當然並不感到詫異；在這短短的三數月內，由於一般物價的上騰，生活指數的倍數自將有這樣倍數的增加。我們感到憂慮的，一則由於此項數字的公布，表示通貨膨脹的效果將更趨惡化，民族經濟的危難必益形深刻；二則由於生活指數的「解凍」，將作爲一般工資計値的標準，使工商業的能力不克負荷，轉使工商業益趨凋敝，使民族經濟瀕於破產，此其結果，或將更招致一般人民生活的不安！</p>
<p>本來生活指數的公布，原與一般人民的生活無甚嚴重的影響。通貨膨脹的結果，使物價的上騰與幣値的下落不斷地在進行着。一般依賴工資或薪給所得以維生的人，在物價不斷上騰的時候，倘使仍照固定的工資薪給，實不足以維生，在生活費用日漲的情形下生活程度自然只能日趨下降。然而生活程度下降也自有其限度，而生活費用的增加，在通貨膨脹的情形下，却沒有止境。在此等情勢下，以生活指數來作爲計算工資或薪給的標準，也自有其理由，本年二月間，各地市塲掀起劇烈的波動，政府因有緊急經濟措施方案的公布，藉以挽救民族經濟的嚴重危機；此在政府，原非得已。在這緊急經濟措施方案裏，其中就有「凍結」生活指數的規定；工資薪給不得再以逐月生活指數爲標準，此後逐月的生活指數，也不得再行公布，而以一月份的生活指數爲工資薪給的標準，並得視物價情形，酌發必需品的實物或差額。此一辦法的能否有效，其樞紐端在政府能否控制物價的變動，使它不再瘋狂的上漲。生活指數的「凍結」，其目的本在使物價趨於安定。在這個意義下，我們歡迎有是項緊急措施方案的頒布。然而物價的波動，其原因並不單純；僅恃生活指數的「凍結」，不能即使物價趨於安定，三數月來，且更逞其瘋在。在此情形之下，我們也不能不同情生活指數「解凍」的要求。</p>
<p>如今生活指數是「解凍」了；其數字的增加在短短的三個月內達三倍。這就是說：以生活指數爲給發工資薪給的雇主，將担負重達三倍的負荷；而在同時期內。他們負荷的能力，却不曾相等的增加三倍。這個重負加到他們身上，將使他們不克負荷，使他們所經營的事業，瀕於破產。此其結果，不特未能使職工的生活有所保障，抑將使民族經濟更趨於嚴重的危難。雞將不存，焉能得卵？况且一般物價如果不能控制，生活指數的倍數勢必日益增高，而雇主的收益却始終不能趕上生活指數增加的倍數。這結果，除了「破產」，還能有什麽？政府對於以生活指數計發工資，雖有折扣的規定，然而鑒於指數倍數的劇增，雇主負荷，依舊不能有多少减輕。這局勢若再演變下去，勢將摧毁現有的一點民族經濟基礎；我們實在覺得担憂！</p>
<p>本來，關於工資薪給，原是雇主與受雇者之間的一種約定。在通貨膨脹的情形下，物價變動是不可避免的事；如何依據物價的變動而有工資薪給的變動，本是雇主與受雇者之間的事。政府如果令飭雇主依據生活指數計發工資薪給，其必要條件端在政府對於物價的變動有控制的能力和自信，使生活指數能夠趨於穩定。倘使政府不能控制物價，斷不能使雇主來承當通貨膨脹的惡性結果。再則，政府如果有照生活指數計發工資薪給的決策，同時亦必輔以津貼政策，籍以减輕雇主的負荷。否則倘若不顧到雇主的能力，則民族經濟的前途，實在可慮。我們願政府能有賢明的舉措來解救這空前的危機。</p>

<h3>創辦本校之旨趣</h3>
<p>— 周振韶</p>
<p>夫敎育者，立國之本也，人民之智愚良竄，國家之盛衰興亡，胥視敎育之普及與否而定，其重要自不待言矣。吾國敎育，素稱落後，學校不能遍及各地，致造成知識恐慌，產生大量文盲，而尤以婦女爲甚，恒以十人而聚，一無知書者，若不急謀補救，國家前途，誠不堪設想矣！本校之創立，實爲適應時代之需要，以增益成年失學婦女之知能耳。茲將創辦之旨趣，略述於後：</p>
<p>（一）爲失學婦女謀取補習敎育之機會　成年失學婦女，感於缺乏智識技能之不便，雖則有志求知上進，乃苦無適當學校；進小學則難與兒童爲伍，進中學則苦程度不及，且中小學均屬全日上課，科目繁多，似不適於婦女之環境與需要，而國內各地，雖有補習學校民衆學校之設立，但或因時間限制，妨礙其家庭工作，或因敎材不當，難符其實際需要，或因設備簡陋，减少其學習興趣，致使之裏足不前，此不僅婦女本身之憾事，且影響家庭社會之不能改進，本校爲補此缺陷，是以別開生面，略予變通，其設施較異於一般補習性質之學校，時間旣可任選，科目不予限制，智識技能，各取所需，以迎合婦女之環境、需要、與興趣，俾使成年失學婦女咸能欣然來學，此爲本校創辦旨趣之一。</p>
<p>（二）爲就業婦女謀取學習技能之機會　男女平等，雖則於法律上早已承認，但事實上尙分軒輊，就職業一項而言之，女子能在社會服務者，究屬少數，推其原因　實智識技能不足，有以致之。蓋女子讀書，流動性較大，常不能持久，是以能受完全敎育者，究屬寥寥，中小學未卒業而輟學及向未入學者，比肩接踵，為數驚人，如此設有關職業以立足於社會，至為困難。故本校特設有關職業之科目，俾供婦女學得一技之長，以謀經濟獨立，不致成為男子之附庸，此為本校創辦旨趣之二。</p>
<p>（三）爲家庭婦女謀取家事常識之機會　家齊而後國治，古有明訓，是以家庭之健全與否，洵足以影響社會國家之治亂也。而婦女爲家庭中之楨榦，一身繫乎全家之命脈，職責至鉅。舉凡相夫敎子，洒掃應對，烹調剪裁，處理雜務，事無巨細，胥恃賢明智慧之主婦以操持，始克造成融融洽洽之和樂家庭。惟是類工作，瑣碎繁重，若無豐富之常識經騐，殊難應付裕如，所謂學作婦人而後嫁，旨哉斯言！故本校特編選關於家事常識之敎材，以灌轍日常生活中之各種智識與技能。幷深體母敎之重要，攸關子女之前途，特加授管敎兒童之方法及兒童之心理等，俾學成後堪爲賢妻良母之典型，此爲本校創辦旨趣之三。</p>
<p>此外本校開辦後，有不少預備升學女生而來補習者，故除上列數種旨趣外，爲預備升學女生之補習，亦成爲本校創辦旨趣之一，總結而言之，本校係為成年失學婦女，預備就業婦女及預備升學女生補習而設，其宗旨爲敎導婦女具有現代生活上所需要之智識技能及品性，使能管理家務及服務社會，期使全國婦女僉能發揮其固有才能，以負荷建設新中國之偉大使命。</p>
<h3>略史</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>上海婦女補習學校，肇端於民國二十一年八月，迄今已十有五年矣。創辦人周振韶氏，自大夏大學敎育學院社會敎育系畢業後，歷任江蘇省立鎭江民衆敎育館敎導主任及浙江省立民衆敎育實騐學校附設實騐民衆學校主任等職，本其多年硏究社會敎育之心得，鑒於我國成年失學婦女，無受敎育之機會，旣不能服務社會，以求男女職業之平等，又不能善主中饋，藉謀家庭生活之幸福。是以租賃上海市華龍路元昌里二十二號爲校舍，設立本校，開我國婦女補習敎育之先聲，校長一職，由創辦人自行兼任。同年十一月十六日呈奉上海市敎育局敎字第二三九五號指令，准予登記。</p>
<p>二十二年七月，爲謀校務之發展，乃敦聘海內社敎先進劉王立明、王孝英、江問漁、周斐成、陳公素、陳鶴琴、馬宗榮（已故）、高賤四（已故）、程俊英、張耀翔，董任堅、鄭通和、潘文安、歐元懷諸先生担任顧問，以使質疑問難，俾益闕漏。</p>
<p>二十三年八月，有鑒於上海區域廣大，爲便利學生就近補習起見，乃於滬西愚園路一百三十八號添辦靜安寺分校·二十四年春，總校以原有校舍不敷應用，遂遷至華龍路五十四號新舍·二十五年秋，改組靜安寺分校爲第一分校，幷遷至地豐路二十六號。二十六年春，又租賃白克路六三〇、六三二號添辦第二分校。幷加聘王曉籟、兪慶棠兩先生為顧問。旋將總校改名第一校，第一分校改爲第二校，第二分校改爲第三校，迨中日戰起，第二校因地址關係，迫而停辦，第三校即遞補爲第二校矣。</p>
<p>二十七年以還，戰事內移，上海居民激增，本校以略具信譽，來學者益形踴躍，逐年遞增，而內部設施，亦日臻完備，舉凡課程之規定，時間之支配，敎學之方法，敎材之編選，無不顧及婦女之實際需要與來學之便利，時加研討，力求改進。</p>
<p>三十四年八月抗戰勝利後，奉上海市敎育局令重新辦理立案手續，乃組織校董會，由校董田達之、陶心喬、顧映川、吳谷聲、吳益之、賀澤民、周振韶等負責辦理立案手續，業於三十六年二月核准設立。本年四月又租賃靜安寺路蝶來新邨十七號，恢復第三校，以便利滬西一帶失學婦女之求學，現已裝修完竣，開始招生，定於六月四日與第一校第二校同時開學。</p>
<p>十五年來，共計來學者三五三三八人，分科計算爲五八五九三人，經敎誨薰陶後，咸能分担社會家庭之職責，惟婦女文盲之掃除與知能之補充，尙有賴於婦女補習敎育之發展，是以今後不特欲使楨榦之日固，抑且力圖校葉之繁榮也。</p>
<h3>校歌</h3>
<p>— 章淪淸</p>
<p>天下興亡責，寗全在匹夫？</p>
<p>惜吾女同胞，多不識之無！亦知有學可以愈愚，叵奈當耽享樂，貧困饑驅！</p>
<p>現象如斯！遑談男女平等，國家前途！東隅雖云失，收穫有桑楡！</p>
<p>願我同儕，利用三餘，知識技能，各取所需！日積月累！小補云乎？</p>
<p>土壤可成泰岱，涓滴可成江湖！勗哉！勗哉！今吾自勝故吾。</p>
<h3>本校慨況</h3>
<p>— 賀澤民</p>
<p>溯自「成人敎育」一詞東輸後，時賢固多急起直追以從事，惟以事屬草創，難免不無偏陂，致忽略成年失學婦女，本校創辦人兼校長周振韶氏，有鑒於斯，乃首創締女補習學校，以思彌補吾國敎育制度之　隙，開辦伊始，瀪路藍縷，慘淡經營，卒賴社會先進之啓導，與周校長之主持得計，而能吶具規模耳。茲屆本校十五周年之期，爰述本校之槪况，藉以就正於國人！</p>
<p>一、組織與編制　本校之經織，爲適應實際需要以增進行政效奉起見，力求簡化，務使事有專責，各司其職；校長秉承校董會之次議，全權處理校務，校長下設秘書一人，以下分文書，會計，庶務，敎務，圖書五股，每股設幹事一人至二人，關於校內各擅行政事項，則由全體職員舉行校務會議討論之；關於敎導事項。則由全體激員舉行敎導會議討論之，幷設有各科敎學硏究會，以謀各科敎學之改進。</p>
<p>本校學級之編制，因性質之不同，故與普通學校週異，以設科言之，分國文、英文、算學、轉記、打字、家事、音樂等科；以時間言之，分早班、午班、夜班三班；以程度言之，自初學起而至高申止；以敎學方法言之，分班級敎學、複式敎學、個別敎學三種。幷基於來蘊者之便利與需要，其科目與時間，均可自由選定。</p>
<p>二、敎導概况敎育爲改進人生之工具，學校之對於學生，不僅予以知識之啓迪，而爲整　生活之指導與改善。本校學生來源不一，且多係成年婦女，是以敎導之方法旣無成規可循，不得不另闢途徑。敎學設施，乃根據學生之心理與需要，幷爲促進敎學效率起見，採用敎導合一制度，俾訓導之責，遍及全體敎師，而使各生智能、思想及品行等，得以同時發展，其敎導槪况，分別條列於下：</p>
<p>甲、敎導目標：本校爲使敎導上有一貫之具體計劃起見，特根據中華民國敎育宗旨，訂定敎導十大目標，以爲實施之準繩，</p>
<p>（一）充實婦女的實用知識　（二）增進婦女的生產技能　（三）陶冶婦女的良好品性　（四）養成婦女的勤勞習慣　（五）提倡婦女的健身運動　（六）改善婦女的休閒娛樂　（七）指導婦女的治家經騐　（八）訓練婦女的團體生活　（九）引起婦女的服務興趣　（十）啓發婦女的愛國思想</p>
<p>乙、敎導原則：（一）根據婦女心理與生理之特徵　（二）注重成年學習之指導與效果　（三）適合學習時間之支配與利用　（四）觀察學生進修之目的與需要　（五）參照普通敎學之原則與方法</p>
<p>丙、敎學方法：本校以性　特殊，故敎學方法，係採興趣的，活動的，改進的，以啓發學生自動學習爲原則，是以隨科而異，因材而殊，無定法可循，以各敎師實際敎學之經騐，而時加研討改善。其敎學之方式，計分三種：</p>
<p>（一）班級敎學　此爲最普通敎學方法，即集合同程度學生，採用同樣敎材以敎授之。</p>
<p>（二）複式敎學　本校各種科目，以採用班級敎學爲原則，間有某科人數過少時，則採複式敎學以補救之。</p>
<p>（三）個別敎學　有關技術之各學科，槪採用個別敎學，本校聘有專門人才，担任敎師，俾能學以致用。</p>
<p>丁、訓導鋼要：本校訓導事宜，係採用導師制，由各科敎師根據訓導綱要，直接或間接予以訓導。其實施方法，先啓發學生之優良動機，以改進婦女生活上之舊習慣，敎師以身作則，注意人格之感化，且多用積極暗示之方法，以使學生潛移默化。其訓導鋼要如下：1.公民訓練：（一）　康樂　身體健康，心地快樂（二）　敏捷　機警靈敏，舉動迅速（三）　精細　愼思明辨，精密判斷（四）　謙和　態度謙虛，待人和氣（五）　誠實　誠信可靠，實事求是（六）　慈愛　孝親慈幼，愛人愛物（七）　勤儉　刻苦耐勞，儉樸節約（八）　禮貌　言行有禮，舉止文雅（九）　負責　盡責服務，絕不推諉（十）　進取　思想前進，精益求精（十一）　勇敢　胆大心細，不怕艱危（十二）　熱心　任俠好義，濟弱扶傾（十三）　樂羣　團結一致，衆志成城（十四）　公正　主張公道，不圖私利（十五）　守法　服從規約，遵守法律（十六）　愛國　犧牲小我，愛護國眾2.職業訓練：（一）職業的意義　（二）職業的分析　（三）職業的選擇（四）職業的準備　（五）職業的修養　（六）職業的效能（七）職業的調劑　（八）職業的改進　（九）聯業的成功3.家事訓練：（一）家庭的功用與重要　（二）主婦的職責與修養（三）經濟的支配與記戲　（四）衣服的裁製與保藏（五）食物的選購與營養　（六）住所的　婦與佈置（七）病者的生活與看護　（八）兒童的敎養與管理（九）家庭的衛生與娛樂。</p>
<p>三、課程與敎材本校所設各科，均具特殊性質，故課程內容與普通學校不同，計　文科分六級，幷附國語會話，包括之謀程爲讀本、尺牘、常識、應用文、會話、書法等；英文科分五級，課程有讀本、文法、會話、尺　、書法等；算學科分五級，課程有算術、代數、幾何、球算等；簿記科分二級，爲初級商業簿記，高級商業簿記；打字科分英文打字、華文打字；家事科分縫紉、刺縫、編織，敎授衣服裁法縫法，機器刺繡法，絨線　織法；音樂科分鋼琴、口琴、歌唱、平劇，敎授鋼琴口琴奏法，各種歌曲及平劇等。</p>
<p>選擇敎材爲補習學校最困難之點，蓋坊間出版課本，多不能適用於補習學校，或則內容不適合，或則敎材分量太多，是以本校分別擬定課程標準，依之而自行編印，其編選原則，注重於適合成年婦女心理與生活上所需要，而每於再版時，則必根據各敎師之意見，加以增删，期能日益求精，試用以來，收效良多。</p>
<p>四、課外活動　欲謀增益學生之知識見聞及求學興趣，自不能僅限於固定之書本範圍，其課外之活動，亦關重要。本校基於學生知識按能及身心健康，特於課外舉行各種活動，俾使各生於体閒時間有正當之娛樂及工作，以養成優良之習慣。其方法分定期的與不定期的兩種，茲略述於下：</p>
<p>（一）定期的：關於各種學藝比賽，本校於每學期開始時，規定日期項目辦法，次第舉行，事先由各主管敎師，負責加以指導與練習，擇優參加，凡比賽優勝者，則給予獎狀及獎品，以資鼓勵。其比賽種類計分：書法、作文、常識、識字、速算、國英文背誦、時事、檢査字典、家事、演說、唱歌、鋼琴演奏、平劇等。</p>
<p>（二）不定期的：本校設有圖書館娛樂室，學生於課後可自由閱讀書報，及參加各項娛樂，且由敎師領導組織參觀旅行團，婦女各種問題研究會等，並參加校外之團體集會。</p>
<p>此外本校所設各科，均規有課外作業，亦屬於課外活動之範圍。國文科有抄書作文造句日記筆記及大小楷行書等，英文科有抄書造句翻譯作文習字等，算學與簿記兩科之習題，亦大都在課外演習，每科雖然每日上課一小時，但課外作業所用之時間則不止一小時，本校對於課外作業之注重，學生獲益匪淺也。</p>
<p>本校之槪况，略如上述，惟十五年來，關於校內之章則辦法，以及各種記錄，因限於篇輻，不及備載，現擬整理後編印成册，再行公之於世，以供關心婦女補習敎育諸君之參考耳。</p>
<p>歷年各科學生統計</p>
<h3>英外相貝文發表演說　檢討世界整個局勢　謂處理遠東問題尤須審愼</h3>
<p>〔路透社塲　特廿九日電〕工黨大會於聆取貝文外相履時七十五分鐘之演辭後，以大多數票否決反對貝文外交政策之一切動議案。貝文之演辭，首先聲明英國對於遠東和約問題之立塲，　要求於討論對日和約時，不再使用波茨坦之方法，自始以至和約之訂立，悉由曾經對日作戰之十一國參加。貝文於述及遠東局勢時，表示遠東局勢之危險，殊不亞於歐洲，中國已陷入內戰的痛苦中，朝鮮乃極嚴重之危險點，他若印度緬甸及荷印之局勢均在動燙中，總之，亞洲正進行重大之變更，需要予以極審愼之處理。</p>
<p>貝文繼述及中東問題，謂該處阿拉伯獨立國之設，應由吾人負重要責任，該處具有油源，而吾人之政策並不以石油利益爲限，吾人當鼓勵該區之社會及經濟發展。</p>
<p>渠　又述及德國問題，謂德境英美區最近成立規定設立經濟委會之協定，決非爲使德國形成最後的分裂，祇因他國之拒絕整個德國之經濟統一，迫使英美不得不採取此一暫時性的步驟。　關於希臘問題，渠表示決不因英國在該處之干涉而致歉意，該處之內戰已吿爆發，但英國決不參加其內戰。渠覺最危險者莫過於強國之參加小國之內戰，大戰往往因此而起，英國退出希臘後，當由美國接替其責任。</p>
<p>最後渠表示渠於就職之初，即曾表示如有期望渠於四五年內獲得重大結果者，不免失望，良以世界已成四分五裂之狀態，前途困難重重，因此渠不得不力持忍耐態度，希望於今年十一月間倦談之徐之各國，最後得以成立協議。</p>
<h3>蘇向英要求貸款數額達五千萬鎊　英蘇商務談判即將恢復</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕權威方面息，蘇聯已向英國要求貸與信用放款五千萬鎊，年息百分之一·五，分十五年還淸。蘇聯並向英表示，在任何新的英蘇貿易協定簽字以前，必須由英國接受此一數額之貸款要求，聞英政府對此一建議猶在研究中。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿九日電〕此間主管人士頃談稱：英蘇兩國商務談判不久即將恢復，足使英蘇兩國之政治關係大爲好轉。惟商務談判首當解決之問題，厥爲英國貸款蘇聯用以購買英國出口貨之條件，聞蘇聯已提出下列三項條件：（一）分期攤還；（二）减低利率至千分之五；（三）延長分期攤還之期限至十六年。凡此三項均非英國所能接受。按英國業已宣佈不能以商業放款貸與任何外國，惟因英國需要蘇聯之小麥與木材，甚爲迫切，故又不得不貸款蘇聯云。</p>
<h3>美陸軍預算　被削减四億餘元</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕美陸長柏德遜雖曾警吿裁减軍費足以削弱戰後之陸軍實力，但衆院撥款委會今日仍將一九四八年度之陸軍預算，减少四億七千五百八十萬九千另七十七元，即减少百分之八·三。按杜魯門總統預算局及全國軍事領袖皆要求五十七億一千六百七十九萬一千五百美元，以健全美陸軍之楚礎，今减少近五億美元，柏德遜認爲空軍與佔領軍尤將受其影響云。</p>
<h3>艾森豪威爾警吿美有遭遇襲擊危險</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿九日電〕美衆院撥款委會，本日討論杜魯門總統爲來年預算所規定之軍費問題，由陸軍參謀總長艾森豪威爾列席陳述意見，要求撥款委會全部予以核准，其言略謂：美國極易遭受突然之空襲而在數小時內慘敗，余深信美國倘不能使其在第二次世界大戰中之勝利，成爲安全之勝利，則繼之而來者將爲任何人從未夢想所及之死亡，恐怖與毁滅之夜魘。世界若再度發生大戰，則首先遭遇攻擊者決非華沙而將爲華盛頓，不是倫敦而爲洛杉磯，甚至亦非珍珠港而將爲匹茨堡港矣云。</p>
<h3>原子委會小組會　通過蘇決議</h3>
<p>原子管制受安理會節制</p>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖卅日電〕美蘇兩國對於原子節制使用否決權問題，今日已有互相攤牌之勢，雙方爭執問題爲原子方面一切管制工作，是否受聯合國機構安全理事會各大國否決權之節制。蘇聯今日在聯合國機構原子能委員會常務小組委員會中獲得一項小決議，已使美蘇爭鬥初具雛型，蘇聯所提決議案，係重申大會之決議，即任何國際原子管制辦法，應在安理會範圍以內工作是，此案已經委員會執行小組一致通過。美國副代表奧斯旁雖投贊威票，但一再切言此案通過，蘇方即可要求原子管制工作，應受否決權之節制。奧氏提出修正案，力主在蘇方決議案中揷入一項，規定此案「絕未修改委員會之初次報吿書」，但未如願。否決權問題規定下星期開始辯論。美英與加拿大均堅主必不可予破壞原子公約者以合法之逃避途徑，故原子管制事宜，決不許使用否決權。</p>
<h3>美蘇混合委會陷入僵持狀態</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社漢城廿九日電〕頃據負責方面消息：美蘇混合委會本日午後討論朝鮮各政黨列席陳述意見一次問題時，對於應准許多少政黨陳述意見一層，相持不下，以致陷入僵持狀態。蘇代表團提議以三十個政黨爲限，並謂，若欲徵詢朝鮮所有各政黨之意見，殆不可能，蓋因單就美佔領區而言，即有一百八十個政黨故也。美代表爲節省時間計，亦同意將陳述意見之政黨，限制其數額，但認爲卅個政黨之數，不免過少，美國認爲陳述意見之政黨爲數過少，徒有利於左翼政黨，良以左翼政黨爲數較少故也，例如在蘇聯佔領區內共黨爲唯一的政黨云。</p>
<h3>我政府當局密切注視　日政局今後發展　片山組閣工作即可完成</h3>
<p>〔新亞社南京卅日電〕日政局自決定社會黨領袖片山負責組閣後，我政府當局雖未作任何正式表示，但在密切注視其組閣經過。據本社記者訪問參政會各黨派中若千注意日本問題人士所得印象，似均對社會黨之組閣成功抱有期待，良以社會黨中左派旣已與共黨絕緣，其右派亦較自由民主兩黨份子爲進步，又不似自由民主兩黨若干黨員仍未能根絕軍國主義之侵略思想。另據某國民黨籍遠東問題專家表示，自由黨之所以拒絕參加以社會黨爲首之四黨聯合內閣者，與其謂眞正反對社會黨左派及共黨，毋寗謂有意利用反共招牌討好美國，以圖該黨他日再起執政，並騙取美國對日援助。蓋日本共黨與中國共黨不同，旣無武裝軍隊，在盟國管制下亦難發動暴動罷工也。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京卅日電〕社會黨書記長西尾，本日下午六時，得悉民主黨幹部會議，決議參加片山內閣之消息後，發表談話稱：「民主黨之態度至最後若決定時，即可召民主國協社會三黨之組閣會議。」自本夜起，即將進行選任閣僚之工作，新人物自各黨推出後，首先徵詢片山首相之意見，然後舉行三黨首腦會議決定。卅一日完成閣僚資格審査等手續，預定下月一日即可舉行閣僚任命式。</p>
<h3>對日索到賠償印度提出要求</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京卅日電〕頃據消息靈通方面稱：「印度政府對於遠東委會賠償小組中各項賠償分配比率均感不滿。廿九日已正式提出要求，謂印度在賠款總額中應獲得百分之十八。</p>
<h3>日經濟界反對生產品充賠償</h3>

<h3>防止六二大暴動　中共破壞份子當局下令逮捕　學生八十餘將被隔離</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長宣司令於昨日下午五時半，在市府會議室接見各報記者，對逮捕中共破壞份子事，有所說明。首由吳市長闡明市府當局處理此番學潮之態度，略稱：本年三月，國民政府令飭中共份子撤回延安時，本市中共辦事處自稱本市僅有中共份子三十四人。本人與宣司令負責地方治安，深知中共份子遠不止此數。雖當時即可以武力令其全部撤退，然其時國共和談之門未閉，咸認爲潛伏之中共份子若能安份守己，則雅不願出此。但事實不然，燒，罷，打等擾亂治安之行爲，竟接踵而起。市府當局曾於事前接獲情報，稱共黨將擇本市工廠，堆棧，及棚戶三區域實行縱火，以擾亂治安。本月初，市府當局又獲得情報，謂共黨陰謀於六月二日大暴動，煽動全市罷課罷市罷工。本月間，各校果以絕不相同之問題實行罷課，然後一致轉向同一之政治目標。且根據市府調查所得，各校中有少數學生確係有政治背景者，而煽動學潮者即係此項學生。</p>
<p>吳市長繼稱：市府根據上列事實，渠等旣企圖於六月二日暴動，若市府聽其發展，待暴動發生後再加懲處，則市民之損害必大。故必須於事前逮捕潛伏各校之陰謀暴動份子，以遏止暴動之發生，俾靑年學子，不受渠等之煽動。根據市府之統計，本市各大學學生約四萬五千人，其中，陰謀暴動份子數不在少，但經過市府當局再三愼重審査之後，認爲有八十餘學生非加以逮捕不可。當局已開具名册，分別逮捕之。其中有一部份學生已被逮捕，餘數將於日內繼續逮捕之。對於被捕學生之處理態度，據吳市長昨稱：將儘量求其寬大，或分別將渠等轉送至中共區域。此外若有悔改表示及確實保證者，亦可從輕發落。至於如何保證之辦法，市府與警備司令部正擬訂中。</p>
<h3>動亂之火燒及社會　為免影響治安不得不採行動　宣司令發表談話</h3>
<p>吳市長發言後，繼由宣司令發表談話，略稱：（一）若干社會人士對於最近風潮之看法，認為係單純之學潮，對於當局逮捕之陰謀份子，認爲係無辜之學生。比種看法實屬不明眞相。蓋如學生爲本身利益而發生學潮，其行動僅限於校內，則當局本不欲過問。但此次風潮，自五月初開始，迄今已近一月，自大學而蔓延及於中學，成一發不可收拾之勢，甚且企圖鼓動工廠罷工，商店罷市，即軍警亦為彼等陰謀煽惑之對象。所喊口號，所貼標語，亦已全非學潮性質。由此可見此次風潮，確係共產黨陰謀破壞治安顚覆政府之整個計劃。各學校中之主使煽動人物，自係共產黨有計劃佈置之潛伏份子。（二）有人認爲軍警千涉學潮不妥，但現時亂火將由學校燒及社會，影響全市人民之安全，軍警當局責任所在，亦爲全部需要安定之市民期望所寄，故不得不採取行動，以保護大多數人民。</p>
<p>將送往共當區</p>
<p>（三）昨日起擬逮捕之學生共產黨及其他共產黨共八十餘人。當然潛伏於本市之共黨尙本止此數，但吾人不擬逮捕太多，現僅擇其中最重要而非捕不可者，經再三審査決定八十餘人，其他潛伏份子希望能自動覺悟。至於已逮捕之份子，當先予隔離，必要時將送彼等離開上海至共黨區域，彼等高喊「反內戰」，自亦應向共黨去高喊。（四）決定逮捕之八十餘人迄今尙未全獲，因昨日警備司令部係用正式手續以公函開列名單通知各校校長，將列名學生交出，但因各校校長未能於事前完全負責，故不得不派軍警自行前往逮捕，因此如交大中之共黨份子大概早知當局決不會聽任彼等活動，事先多已逃匿，故迄今逮捕工作尙未完全達成任務。</p>
<p>名單不日公佈</p>
<p>（五）被捕之共產黨徒，均經調査有確實之證據，其名單當不日會同市政府公佈。又此次被捕者中有記者數人，當局現不問其爲記者抑係學生，凡係主要之共黨份子而陰謀煽動風潮，破壞安寗者，均要逮捕。（六）交通大學之一部份少數學生，爲領導風潮破壞治安之最主要份子，其餘大多數學生及其他學校大都受此少數人之煽動。祇須即日復課，當局決不株連無辜，惟若學生仍不覺悟，繼續企圖在六二遊行暴動，發動罷工罷市，則治安當局被迫更勢必採取斷然之處置。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部上海區燃料管理委員會，前以秦皇島來煤受阻，自本月十九起迄昨日爲止，迄無點煤運到，致上月底存煤，僅有五萬餘噸。本月底存煤，則僅四萬餘噸，存底枯竭，爲防患未然計，特於昨日下午三時，召集各關係方面舉行臨時緊急會議。戚墅堰電廠，濬浦局，招商局，上海港口司令部，京滬路局，紡建公司，工業協會，浙贛鐵路，市公用局，市社會局，工商輔導處，輪船公會，杭州電廠等代表二十餘人，出席參加。由燃管會主委徐樂天主席。首由主席報吿，略以上週一自京返滬時，深感秦皇島供煤情况惡化，致此後供煤，恐無把握。所幸近日來消息報到，開灤煤礦生產，及鐵路修復情形，均已好轉。國軍對該區治安，亦備極關注。故每日仍能維持供應量三千噸，月能供給九萬噸。此外葫蘆島方面，月供二萬噸，淮南及台灣煤礦，每月各供五萬噸，故六月份各地供應總量，尙能維持廿一萬噸之數額，勉敷本區及其他各埠下月之需要量。惟仍請需煤各機關，設法未雨綢繆，以備於供煤萬一發生問題時，仍能自行維持。本會亟望煤斤之供應，能設法增加。目前如淮南煤礦，產量每月已達七萬噸。如政府能予以資金上之援助，預計年底時每月可產九萬噸。台灣方面，亦有增產，可望每月供給五萬噸。至商運方面，近亦循商民之請，除屬管制之東北，開潔，淮南，中興，華東，台灣等各礦外，他如四川，湖南，江西各地小礦，在不與當地管制範圍衝突之條件下，儘量鼓勵採運。其一次之採運量，煤商不得超過一百噸，廠商不得超過一月需要量。同時本會曾與中央銀行洽商，對煤商之自備外匯，而願自國外運煤來華者，其限額應儘量放寬，亦可望實現。至調整煤價問題，刻正待全國物價委會於今日（卅一日）討論核定，俾便增加各礦之供應量云。最後由各代表發表意見，會議迄四時許散會。</p>
<p>又査該會配撥本區及其他各埠每月之煤斤，計公用事業四萬噸，鐵路二萬四千噸，船舶二萬噸，外埠電廠（沿京滬杭綫）一萬四千噸，政府機關六千噸，海陸空軍盟邦慈善等三千噸，工廠三萬噸，靑島二萬噸，連雲港二千噸，漢口七千噸，外埠（廣州厦門福州）一萬噸，以上共計十七萬六千噸，再加南京部份四萬噸，總計爲廿一萬六千噸云。</p>
<h3>食米供多銷滯　售價再見下挫　平價麵粉決恢復配售</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市市氣不振，脚地虛軟，在供多銷滯之情况下，市價續見下挫。昨南北兩市塲共到貨五千七百七十八石六斗。白粳南市做四十萬　北市卅九萬五千元。簿稱卅九萬元至卅九萬五千元。早稻卅七萬五午元。羊秈卅六萬至卅六萬五千元。白元四十一萬元。陰元卅九萬元，碾秈卅三萬元。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市麵粉配售辦事處，自明日起　決恢復平價麵粉之配售。該處負責人，昨已與中央信託局洽妥付款出貨辦法，故週日該處決照常辦公，明日收款，後日開始出貨。每日配售總額爲八六七八包，其分配情形，有如後列：</p>
<p>業別　會員家數　核配包數大餅油條　四一六三　四一七九切麵　一一七二　三〇九四麵包餅干　一四三　一四〇五</p>
<p>配價以五十磅洋粉計算，每包爲七萬五千五百元，另售價每包爲七萬九千三百元云。</p>
<p>大麥元麥蠶豆均已見新，長江區最早新麥亦將收割在邇，市塲交易冷懈。</p>
<p>麵粉去化仍淡，疲乏之局，修削二三千元。鈇皮大包銷路呆滯，狂跌三四千元，小包則浙省有動，挺升千餘元，形成背道而馳。豆餅先疲後挺，無甚榮辱，黄豆去路平常，再降二三千元。</p>
<p>紅糧交易冷淡，步削三五千元，苞米亦然不振，續跌二三千元，菉豆仍在痰中徘徊，仍難生色。生仁芝蔴洋莊廣帮互相納取，回漲萬元。油市先跌繼漲，結果生油反昂三五千至萬元，豆油彷彿，蔴油平定。</p>
<h3>統債明升暗平</h3>
<p>公債昨高後略回，三六〇室有售，五五五室五五二室則進，統丙晨開一五五〇〇元，自一五七〇〇元退至一四四〇〇元，最後仍在一五二〇〇元左右盤旋。結果則與前日相較明升而暗平，甲乙丁戊各漲五百元至七百元不等，成交約七八百萬。</p>
<h3>外股買氣濃厚</h3>
<p>外股昨證券帮買胃加强，怡紗怡睥更爲垂靑者所追逐，金鈔黑市以及港匯一致堅昂，（港申電縮至十四元一角半，）金融帮亦有納胃，廣帮出後亦進。怡紗自六七五〇〇元開後，盤高至七七〇〇〇元而後稍回，結果較前收計業廣尙平，怡紗怡啤各漲成半弱，英聯紙業電話各升半成強，餘吿徵升，電力優先廿三萬有求無供。</p>

<h3>華股突起反動　永紗等均漲停</h3>
<p>華股昨突吿反動，補空驟殷，證券帮中若少壯派等咸有吸收，逐步盤倘。永紗信和商務永公火柴新亞中絲俱吿漲停，永紗漲停後有某權要派之企業公司補空，加價頗多，惟高後形勢似形飄忽。</p>
<p>晨開升降俱見，遞永紗由七六號一三七號一〇五號八五號一七一號來進，開後升至七一八〇元，九一號一八六號一九〇號一〇六號八九號八二號一一七號脫手，遞永紗曾退至六九八〇元，七七號七六號六五號一四二號一〇二號趁低吸納，升至七二五〇元，九四號二一五號脫手，稍有回風。</p>
<p>無何新亞首先漲伴，一七一號不時吸納，一〇二號二二四號一五二號九九號一九九號一五四號俱進，漲風忽起。信和商務永公火柴次第漲達限度，現永紗由川二號一五五號掛漲停買進，港申電報縮，金價暗市狂躍，遞永紗終於升至七六五〇元漲停板，此後中絲亦吿漲停。新光突有證券帮垂靑，一七一號一五二號一一七號俱進，漲勢加速，升至二〇〇元外。遞永紗有一二九號一六三號二一九號等購買，尤以一二九號補空最勁，暗市曾喊高至七九二〇元，一三〇號錢兌帮，七六號一五五號一四號脫手，而吿下降，收市時更由二號力售，回降至七七〇〇元，而後平定。</p>
<p>結果較前收，計遞交方面永紗永公漲停，信和漲停後有回，華豐新光升一成左右，景福勤興升半成，即交各股永紗信和漲停，永公漲停後有回，與華豐新光勤興中法新華同漲一成光景，景福升半成，中絲火柴商務新亞漲達限度。中紡榮豐升半成强，統益大通漲一成有零，國貨漲起一成半，景綸平平，水泥麗安微升，塲外各老股上漲者居多數。</p>
<h3>利買消息頻傳　紗布價俱上揚</h3>
<p>昨日紗市雖値紡建開售，塲上各種利多消息頻傳，且銀根亦已鬆弛，買戶遂轉活躍，晨開即吿上揚。四二支藍鳳紗初開一千二百五六十萬元，迨至最後高至一千三百二十萬元，比上日猛升一百萬元。廿支特雙馬亦高至八百四十萬元，軋漲八十五萬元。雙馬紗七百六十萬元，跟升五十五萬元。其餘十六支等各紗均較上日漲四五十萬元不一。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，以銀根趨鬆，塲內津漢粵客帮收購頗勁，各方游資集中布市，新買活動力甚强，兼廠家亦有進意，初開龍頭細布由卅萬零七千元步開步高，至最後爲卅三萬三千元，比上日昂騰二萬六千元。其餘各牌細布及漂布元布藍布等價，亦均帶好五六千元至二萬元許，惟士林布獨見穩定。</p>
<h3>人造絲第二批貨　由日運到二千箱　昨市價報漲實銷微細</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信托局昨日又自日運到人造絲二千箱，此尙屬本年度第二批到貨，該局已定於下週一恢復配售，將先配絲織業申請量十分之一。又訊：絲織業公會以同業缺乏生絲原料，生產不繼，昨特分向中央銀行，中蠶公司，中央信託局等，要求將去年收購之生絲存貨一千一百餘包中，撥配三百二十包，供同業應用云。</p>
<p>昨市人造絲上午尙稱堅穩，一二〇號高山有光一千八百八十萬元開盤，盤旋至九百二十萬元收盤，下午傳來利買消息，人心激昂，由九百五十萬元直漲至二千〇三十萬元收盤，結果比上日大一百五十萬元，七五號金鷄半光討價二千七百萬元，不過實銷甚微，並未成交。</p>
<p>昨市廠經漲風未衰，B字等級討價竟達二千六百萬元，D字等級討價二千五百萬元，但因討價太高而乏人還價，各級均無成交，高另擔藍雙虎做開二三擔，價作二千四百五十萬元。干經另擔，亦有成交，價做一千八百萬元，比上日價皆漲起一百萬元之譜，新高價層見疊出，買戶爲之束手，故連日交易極爲稀少。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨人心堅昂，一致步升。美亞被面塲內未曾做開，華强被面八百五十萬元有成交，大誠格子璧縐，先做三萬三千元，中間做三千四五百元，最後爲三千三百元有成交。華錦縐上午一萬四千五百元有交易，下午喊一萬五千元，無光紡及條子紡等均高一千元之左，盛貨電力紡因原料日昂，產地報漲，昨申市亦高一二萬元，特尖四二洋紡價達十二萬元。</p>

<p>絲織業請配售生絲</p>
<p>第四區絲織業工業同業公會，鋻於本市生絲存底不豐，市價飛漲，昨已高達每擔二千六百萬元，所屬各會員，除一部份已代產銷聯營公司織造外銷綢緞外，其餘織造內銷綢緞三百餘會員，擁綢機三千五百台，均無法購取高價原料，勢有不能繼續開工之虞。昨日該會理事長蔡昕濤，特分謁有關當局，提議將去年度中信局收購生絲剩餘部份，約一千二百餘擔，先行酌量配售，預計每一台機可配得二十斤，總數爲三百六十擔，足可維持半個月開工原料云。</p>

<h3>蠶絲產銷協導會　請增撥千億貸款　昨日舉行第五次委員會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經農兩部蠶絲產銷協導委員會，於昨日上午，在上海武進路二一六號中蠶公司，開第五次季員大會。到冷禦秋·譚熙鴻·馬保之·張毓華·刁民仁·王伯天·陶菊如·董贊堯·皮作瓊·何北衡·范崇實·陳雋人·葛敬中·湯錫祥·夏道湘，列席許行彬·王化南·沈九如·邵申培·陸子容·主席譚熙鴻。首先宣讀第四次會議紀錄，次報吿浙江收繭及江浙貸款情形，再次討論：</p>
<p>（一）繭價仍按原定不動，惟按繭質優良，酌予提加。</p>
<p>（二）貸款除四聯核准外，仍請增撥一千億，貸款須於蠶繭旺期前，撥匯收繭地點。</p>
<p>（三）經費預算：經常臨時各費預算，交由農林部，中央中農兩行，中蠶公司及本會，派員審査，提交下次會議以後，呈報主管部</p>
<p>（四）抑低繭價處理辦法，修正通過。</p>

<h3>輸管會規定　進口貨分配辦法</h3>
<p>第二季輸入品之限額，業經輸管會公佈。惟邇來爲各種物品之分配問題，進口商與工業界爭執甚烈。輸管會對此事現規定凡性質單純之進口貨物，如棉花，羊毛，報紙等，其種類細目甚少，用戶亦較固定者，交由各該工業公會分配予各會員。但各該工業公會請求申請核准後，必須交由進口商進口，不准自己進口。凡性質複雜之進口貨物，如化學原料，機械零件等種類細目繁多，用戶亦多，而各工業公會中又無一集中管理之工會，故祇有交予進口業分配。爲避免進口商私自將進口限額非法售出起見，進口商須呈騐銷貨合同後，始可准許進口。此外尙有爭執三點，經該會査明，（一）有一部份工廠呈請登記爲進口商而不合格者，想避免進口商之收佣金，但自行設法進口而獲分配權。（二）有一部份工廠需要量較多，勢必集中幾家進口商之進口限額始能滿足需要，並欲能設法進口而獲分配權。（三）有一部份工廠所需之原料爲營通進口商所不願進口者，彼等亦欲能自行進口而獲分配權。該會頃已集中此三種問題，詳加考慮，將逐步予以改進云。</p>

<h3>施耐菴事跡之新商榷</h3>
<p>— 喩蘅</p>
<p>故鄉白駒鎭，在范公堤上，別名舊塲，取詩經「皎皎白駒，食我塲　」的意義命名。這個小地方，曾是民族革命英堆張士誠的發祥地，也是水滸傳作者施耐菴的埋骨處。</p>
<p>施耐菴的原籍問題，今古聚訟紛紜，據水滸傳上作者自序署爲東都（洛陽？）却有人說他原籍是淮安，又有人說是錢塘，更有人說施耐菴是羅貫中的化名，而我們故鄉姓施的人以及興化縣志上又說他是興化白駒人。因爲缺乏文籍的考據，大家無非是憑理想推斷，因而愈弄愈不明白了。</p>
<p>去年秋天，申報春秋會刋有兩篇關於施耐庵的文字，頗具高見，可惜語焉不詳。今由故鄉施復甦醫師抄寄施氏族譜內淮安王道生的「施耐菴墓志」（興化縣志所載略有同異）及袁吉人編「施耐菴光生小史」中的片斷部份，我且先照樣錄下，以供賢明有識之士的參考：</p>
<p>墓志：公諱子安字耐菴（興化縣志則謂諱耳字子安）元末賜進士出身，官錢塘二載，以不合當道權貴，棄官歸里，閉門著述，追溯舊聞，鬱鬱不得志，賣恨以終。公之事略，余雖不得詳，可以緀述，公之面目，余雖不得親見，僅想望其顏色，蓋公死之年，七十有五，而余尙垂髫。及長，得識其門人羅貫中於閩，仝寓逆旅，夜間秉燭談先生軼事，有可歌可泣者，不禁相與慨然。先生之著作，有志餘三國演義，隋唐志傳，三遂平妖傳，江湖豪客傳，即水滸傳。每成一稿必與門人羅貫中校對，得力於羅者甚多。嗚呼，英雄生亂世，則雖有淸和之識，亦不得不賚志以終，此其爲千古幽人逸士痛哭流涕者也。先生家淮安時，與余牆一間，惜余生太晚，未親敎益，每引爲恨事，客歲，其後人述元先生，移柩南去，與余流連再四，問其家世，諱不肯道，問其志則又唏噓歎惋，問其祖與羅貫中所述略同。鳴呼！國家多事，志士不能展其所負，以鷹犬奴隸待之，將遯世名高，（此處當有遺漏字句）况□亂大作，小人當道之世，先生之身世可謂不幸矣。而先生雖遭亂困頓，不肯卑躬屈節，啓口以求薦達，閉戶著書以□，先生立意可　純潔矣。……（其下即殘　）</p>
<p>小史……耐菴與士誠　將下元亨相友善，士誠繕具甲兵，窺伺元室，以卞元亨爲光鋒，聞耐菴名徵聘不應，士誠造其門，見耐菴正命筆爲江湖豪客傳，即水滸傳也。士誠笑曰：「光生不欲顯達當時，而弄筆以自遣，不亦虛度歲月乎？」耐菴聞而投筆頓首對曰：「不佞無他長，惟恃柔翰爲知己，將車豪氣縱横，海內望風瞻拜，不棄　駘，枉駕辱臨，不佞誠死罪矣！志士立功，何敢固辭；奈家庭多變，母老妻弱，子女婚嫁，債務朱　，一旦捨去，則母失所依，將軍仁義如雨澤遍施，當必憐憫而使盡孝，則啣結有日矣。言已伏地不起，士誠不悅，拂袖而去。是時江湖豪客傳正四十五回矣。……這兩篇殘零的文字，據說由來相當久遠了，可惜沒有翔實的年月可炎考據，但據我的推測，它一定是眞實的紀載，居心作偽的人決不會這樣老實。根據其中有五點綫索，可以尋繹：</p>
<p>墓志：官錢塘二載……</p>
<p>小史：耐奄與士誠部將卞元亨相友善，士誠不悅拂袖而去，</p>
<p>墓志：先生家淮安時，其後人述元先生移柩南去……諱不肯道。</p>
<p>這幾點綫索，使問題得到一個新穎的發現，雖不能證實，但至少是一個很近情理的假想，即是：施耐菴曾一度隱居過白駒，大約在官錢塘二載後的幾年中，那時正是元廷失政，天下大亂之始，他這樣的人決不肯安心於溷亂的政治塲合中的，他因此棄官，起初是欲北歸故里，但那時已是鐵馬金戈烽烟漫天，一個兩袖淸風的窮官，（施耐菴大槪不會括地皮，否則他筆底的英雄們不會那般仇視貪官）帶着家小，從錢塘到洛陽（假定故鄉即是洛陽）自然很困難。留在浙江讓方國珍捉去嗎？自然也不能够，這時置身於危亂的區域中，進退維谷之際，僅可能選擇一條比較近而安穩的去處了。再看這時許多反王之中，白駒的張士誠是最能景賢禮士的，（明史張士誠本紀有道樣類似的評語）耐菴旣和士誠部將卞元亨友善，並且他又是一個有激烈革命思想的作家，當然可能懷着一種新希望到白駒來，想同張士誠合作一番功業，所以他舉家遷到白駒。後來，士誠的作爲被他看透了，料定他不會成功，索性隱居立言，把心中所想像的英雄人物，一一加以描寫，反襯以那時政治黑暗的現實，假借宋刺末年宋江的故事，以抒發他胸中無可奈何的積憤了。及至士誠親自來找他出仕，因他已懷着成見，反而怒惱了士誠，白駒當然不宜久住了，他單獨流亡到淮安，這裏也許是上洛陽必經的地方，終於因道途梗阻，不得不寓居淮安。同時更可能因爲他的作品引起了官方的反感，他避免文字獄，更不能出頭，（墓志中所稱「諱不肯道」或即此故。）直至後來客正在淮安。稍後，他留在白駒的兒孫，還回他的靈柩，就葬在現在所說的那個施家欋，他的一支血系，就永遠成了白駒的土著。</p>
<p>現在留給人們憑弔的，僅有那白駒西十七里大營地方附近的施家橋邊的一坏荒塚了。據施氏族譜上說，他們十七世祖述元公（耐庵的孫）曾在這裏屯兵，大營小營的名稱就起於這時，左近有屯軍墾地數萬畝，迄今仍名屯軍鄕。</p>
<p>民國廿九年夏，江蘇省政府北遷，民敎兩廳暫駐白駒凡半年，民政廳長王公嶼和敎育廳長金宗華兩氏，曾有志於此項文學史上一大疑案之發掘，擬考據耐菴墓穴，可惜正熱烈計劃的時候，又因時局一變，省府西遷興化，二公鳴　去後，這件事，也慢慢地被大家在多難的歲月中遺忘了。三六，三·廿一。</p>
<h3>舊家</h3>
<p>— 秦嶺</p>
<p>偶而返家，與母親閒談時，她幽幽地吿訴我後圍那座畫閣被一夜風雨打坍了。——已忘懷的舊家之樓閣和人物又閃耀在眼前。</p>
<p>祖父在世的時候，這個畫閣是他晚年息隱之所，祖父是學而仕，仕而商，繼而又退歸於學的，早年奔波幸勞的生活造成了晚年安閒愛靜的性格。園裏一草一木都由他親自設計，花圃·樹叢分佈得宜，我尤其愛畫閣前的一株梧桐，夏季枝葉婆娑，遮蔽得滿室生綠。祖父以「絲滿窗」題其書齋，眞是萬分恰切，還記得楹聯是用的「柑子荳莢新蔬果，竹杖藤鞋舊布衣」二句。幼時倚在祖父膝前，他老人家曾逐日敎我記識這些字句。祖父喜歡書法，每日淸早揮毫習字，一個專供他差遣的小僮每晚總得磨上一瓦缽墨汁；祖父對於筆墨之選擇相當嚴格，墨不可磨得太快，以免粗糙，墨汁又須放置一定時期才准使用。當那個僮兒在火油燈旁打着瞌睡硏墨時，我們總要作弄他，攪得他快又不是，慢又不是，墨汁塗得一臉一手。可惜祖父習字的藍本種類太多，結果反不能專一而精，寫起來非歐非蘇；亦趙亦王，以致不敢爲人甫寫對聯。</p>
<p>祖父有着嚴肅不苟的性格，只要一聽得他的咳嗽聲，家人們便噤若寒蟬了。可是我却是例外，我常爬在小櫈子上陪他寫字，回答一些大膽的話、他總撫摸着我的辮子笑着說：「這妮子眞淘氣！」祖母也是極愛書本的，一卷在手便萬事不問不聞了。幼時隨口唱着的千家詩與唐詩便是從祖母那兒得來的，老奶媽（六伯父的奶娘）常常說：「太太的好性格眞是難見，只要捧着書本子，小孩子們打破了頭都是不管。」眞的，祖母對於家務瑣事不愛操心，什麼都讓老奶媽經管。奶媽眞是我家的功臣，大伯。父親。與小叔叔都是她帶大的。然而祖母對於烹妊却有獨特的技藝，祖父宴客時常常以她的成績爲驕傲，他們二位的特長，現在只剩下很少的一部分遺留給我們。</p>
<p>老奶媽是我們童年的好伴侶，當祖父父親夜出朱歸時，我們陪着她等門，在暗鬱鬱的燈光下，她摟着我們講山海經，尖着喉嚨唱歌謠，我們幾個堂兄妹都是她的寵兒，什麼難題都找她解決去，幹了錯事要她在媽媽面前討情，兄妹們吵架找她評理。她每次上街回來，每個「寳貝」（她對我們的稱呼，）都有點零食吃，所以老奶媽那時是孩子們的上帝。</p>
<p>此外，園丁老喬也是舊家的主要角色，祖父愛吃新鮮菜蔬，園子一角劃爲采畦，老喬能識得祖父的嗜好，四時蔬菜安排得很適宜，同時又能修剪花枝，懂些栽種門徑，無疑的他與老奶媽就在僕人之間形成了獨特的地位。老喬把花樹看得和祖父一般重要，誰摘了果子誰就得遭罵。記得有一次車夫偸摘了幾校樱桃，老喬咕嚕了半天。可是第二天那株櫻桃被人劈下了半棵，老喬氣得飯都沒吃。不過凑上他飲酒的時候，牌氣就柔順得出人意外，一天工作下來，一盞擦得雪亮的洋燈，半瓶燒酒，二十銅子醬肉是他的小天地，有了幾分酒意他就講起一連串的往事來了。他的私奔的妻子，養到十六歲又死掉的兒子，三年當兵的生活，臂膊上的槍傷……最後他睜着紅紅的眼睛歎息着說：「我是什麽都經過來了。」</p>
<p>以上那些人物裏只剩了老喬還健在，雖則六十多年紀，頭髮還是烏黑，不過背脊已彎起來了。閉上眼，我淸晰地記得祖父胖胖的留有幾綹鬍鬚的長臉，祖母嫻靜慈祥的笑容，老奶媽滿是皺紋的面頰。可是，我抓不住它們，它們與我離得這樣遠，這樣遠……像斷了綫的風箏。</p>
<p>二十年來，舊家經了太多的變化，祖父母去世後，園子是逐漸荒蕪了。爲了後人不需要它們的緣故，那座畫閣油漆斑剝，窗格都歪斜地走了樣，偶然跑到裏面去，那些滿佈塵埃的書箱，漬有水跡的祖父的字稿，使我心頭湧上莫名的悵惘。窗前那株梧桐被螞蟻蛀蝕得滿身創傷，園子中心又築了防空洞，一切都變了，園子往昔的繁盛跟着祖父的咳嗽聲，跟着我的童年同被深深葬埋了。我並不迷戀於舊家的骸骨，我知道一切好的景物都會過去，都會消滅。可是，想及祖父那時飲酒吟詩的昇平之仳，那種閒適恬和的心情，我標止不住我的悲哀。</p>
<h3>重遊西湖</h3>
<p>— 馬公愚</p>
<p>春來消息只干戈，却向西湖聽踏歌；過隙廿年鶯物改，浮空十里任肩摩，夢回鶴寺風流盡，禮罷龍泓感慨多（與西冷印社春祭）；所喜故人仍滿眼，班荆七日醉顏酡。</p>
<h3>松</h3>
<p>— 柯定</p>
<h3>家書</h3>
<p>— 惠芝</p>
<p>在一個冷雨敲窗雪花紛飛的殘冬的深夜，你從那銀色的世界裏，偸偸地離開孤島，含着辛　別離了慈祥的母親與我；當時，雖然你竭力用理智克制那心頭的憂鬱，但，你又那裏能曉得母親及我的悲痛，還勝於你那顆游子心情呢？</p>
<p>以前，你常常吿訴我要「自立」，不願意陶醉在象牙塔裏，你要逃避這低氣壓環繞的氛圍，追求靑年人最崇高的理想，我知道在你的心坎裏，那久經激越的感情，已劃破了固封在心底的防隄，這都市，道孤島，這魔城，於你是無所戀留了。</p>
<p>然而，這些日子裏，你知道，母親和我一直過着什麽樣的生活，又如何的爲你走向舉目無親的遼遠異鄕而焦慮，爲你爬山涉水渡着那飄泊的流浪生涯而躭憂。總算幸運，一年以後，才接到你那封來自錦城的家書，知道你從金華經上饒經過八千里長途跋涉，才到了成都，老人家和我的心才安靜下來，然而，許久許久，又得不到你的信息了。</p>
<p>光陰像流星似地過去了，當勝利的旗幟已飄蕩在收復區的城頭上，我是多麼興奮啊！母親也愉快地呈現出她那幾年來未有過的笑容說：「這眞是上帝賜予我們的恩惠，你的哥哥馬上就可以回來，咱們將團聚一堂盡情的狂歡了。」我聽了以後，高興地連飯都不想吃，靜待着你的歸來，帶給我們全家的幸福。然而，却連你的消息都沒有了。</p>
<p>直到去年的春天，綠衣使者才送來了一封來自華盛頓的雙掛號信。當我接到那封異常陌生而沉重的信時，我很奇怪，仔細一看，才知道是你的信。從你那潦草的字跡上流露出的情感，使我和母親得到無限的安慰。想不到你竟然投効空軍，而且，逮涉重洋到美國去深造，這眞出乎我們意料之外。</p>
<p>一批一批的空軍戰士都已回國，我想，你歸期也不遠了。但願你駕着B29的超空堡壘，横過太平洋，安全地飛回祖國的上空，回到六年不見的家園，這裏的親友在等待着你。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「當然同路的好，彼此都有照應——這麽辦罷，我們用二十碼左右遞進方式，逐步進襲；儘量躱避敵人，以不動手爲最上方略；目的只在接應—假如我們已有人進去的話—如來得及出來，當然可以領導大隊，順利進襲，如時間不够，或太困難，我們就在裏面內應…」守一定下這個方式，又對那小個子說：「您請留心，大隊也許就要趕到了；一到，就請他們按原定方式，三面包圍進攻」！</p>
<p>這原定方式，爲什麽只包圍三面？留下那第四面一個缺口，是個什麽用意？原來這是用兵至精的法門；四面包圍，敵人就會弄成「困獸猶鬥」的心理；」困獸」可能不顧一切，拚死要殺出一條血路來。况且鹤見守一這方而，還有投鼠忌器的弱點，生恐他們下手把萍子幹掉，那才是白費心機哩。</p>
<p>說也不信，就在守一鶴見和那小個子商量已妥，正要動手當口，只聽得遠遠地，匪窩裏，陡然起了槍聲，緊接居然放起鬼呌一般的警笛，烏烏亂呌，屋頂的探照燈居然有兩架之多，放出兩股耀眼的光華，四面轉動探照。</p>
<p>「這是一個無法無天的舉動！這般東西，憑了什麼，就在人家國度裏，如此胡行亂爲？」鶴見看見這並沒有淪陷的上海裏，日寇竟敢如此猖獗，感覺奇怪。</p>
<p>「快走……跟我來！」守一從車裏一躍而出，對鶴見低聲喝着。</p>
<p>守一爲什麼這般惶急？在他的意想中，他認爲百認莊的四個淘氣小姐，也許還有別的人，已經襲進這個窩子，知已被敵方發覺，所以大驚小怪，這般大鬧起來。這的一鬧，想到那羣淘氣的，也許已經被對方包圍着了。所以不能不惶急。守一和鶴見，雖說僅有兩人，然而總是一個接應；况且兩人的能力，相當壯實哩。</p>
<p>兩人疾走了幾十步，只見黑影裏迎頭飛馳過來一個人影，那人一面跑一面打着警號，守一聽出是自己人，便也放也暗號。</p>
<p>「09…？」</p>
<p>「…15！」</p>
<p>雙方一對口號，那人立即煞住脚步；「事情有了變局了！」中國話裏夾雜着些日本口音。</p>
<p>「怎麽樣？快說！」守一索性用日本話了。</p>
<p>聽見裏面好像是內哄；一個首腦傢伙的口氣在駡人，聲音亂得很；一時聽不明白，又怕被燈光意見，所以趕來報吿…」</p>
<p>「去報吿罷！」守一向那人喝了一聲，對鶴見一招手，向荒塲方面直奔過去。這兩人都是賽跑競走塲合裏拿過錦標的，所以幾十碼大路，再加幾十碼寬的荒塲，簡直不値一跑。可因要躱避對方暗崗和探照燈光！當然不能像賽跑那樣追風逐電似的痛快；只能像捉迷藏一樣，閃閃躱躲，跑跑停停地進展着。他們本來約定了二十碼遞進方式，這時因事態有變動，改爲十碼，甚至五六碼遞進了。</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>今天鼎堂先生送給我一張字，上面寫着：</p>
<p>「史言，杜工部因食牛肉而致死，嘗推究其原因，蓋不出二途；一因牛肉已腐而中　，另一則因絕糧過久，頓食過多，不能消化。恐以後者爲較近事實。工部貧　，固常常絕食也。言之可有餘痛。」</p>
<p>我讀後大笑，笑後歷痛大發。自惟鬻文生涯者，其苦皆然。</p>
<p>而所謂「人類靈魂工程師」，尙不若破廟內之木　泥塑能得愚民禮拜。</p>
<p>杜子美詞又何　土地財神香火之盛也。</p>
<p>廟裏供的財神菩薩，右手執鋼鞭，袴下騎猛虎。我覺得最初作俑的，必別有寓意。</p>
<p>財神之所以能富，其故厥在鋼鞭猛虎。</p>
<p>財迷們啊！你們不必苦苦地跪在財神的座前。我勸你如果沒有原子彈或手槍之類的武器的話，還是趕緊跑到後面廚房裏去，廉快你的那把菜刀。沒有猛虎，可以猛狗代之；不然猛人也好。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>淪陷夫人的悲劇　談安慶箱屍案</h3>
<p>— 虛舟</p>
<p>最近安慶大學講師聶協羣謀殺其「淪陷夫人」，他的舉止遠較電影「衣錦榮歸」裏的「林道君」險惡多多，然則是電影故事追不上現實呢，抑或是現實的險惡已遠超過一般文人的想像以外了？</p>
<p>魯迅先生曾說過：「由於世故較深，我對若干事象不免想得較刻毒，可是結果現實的刻毒却往往更甚於我的想像。這眞是沒辦法的事。」（大意）請不要以爲這是笑話，以眞話爲笑話的庸衆，總有一天將自食其愚庸的惡果的。在中國社會里，一個稍稍肯深思的人，能够輕鬆地笑幾聲，亦大不容易吧。一個寄暇想於幻夢的浪漫蒂克的文人，眼看到現實的殘酷，也只好做一個悲觀者，更何况其他的寫實王義者呢。寫實主義者的筆，竟也追不上現實的殘酷，甚至只好徒喚奈何，這一方面說明了文人的可悲，一方面也證實了中國確有其「特殊國情。」</p>
<p>這位安慶大學講師聶協羣，是一個十足的智識份子，有極高的文化修養，然而請看他是怎樣對待他的「淪陷夫人」呢？</p>
<p>「（某報安慶通信）聶協羣爲安大法學院講師，武漢大學畢業，原配陳佐羣，結褵多年，生有一女，名菊英，已十四齡。抗戰軍興，聶轉進後方，陳逐淪爲「淪陷夫人」，三十三年聶後娶湖北女子余流芳爲抗戰夫人。迄勝利後，余流芳始發覺聶另有妻子，喋喋不已，聶發誓必與陳離婚，否則決以武力對付。……詎十八日陳佐羣突携女尋來，當晚聶乃使陳與己同牀，夜半聶即以棉花塞住陳口，呼余起，共以紗布勒陳咽喉，陳不能出聲……氣絕後，聶即與余將屍體裝入帆布箱內，企岡拋入江中。……」</p>
<p>這就是轟動一時的安慶箱屍案，主犯竟是大學講師，奇怪的是，迄犯案前一天止，他還在安慶大學敎授「倫理學」與「哲學概論」呢。不知道他所敎的「倫理學」中，有無「如何處置淪陷夫人」這一項目，如果沒有，也不要緊。他的「身敎」比他的「言敎」强多了。</p>
<p>我在想，如果有人敢將安慶的箱屍案編爲電影，則趙丹編導的「衣錦榮歸」將爲之黯然失色，是可以預料的吧。</p>
<h3>今在蘭心舉行獨唱會之蔣英小姐</h3>
<h3>伍正謙獨唱會</h3>
<p>— 聲和</p>
<p>著名的男高音（Tenor）伍正謙敎授將於六月一日在蘭心舉行獨唱會，這是繼女高音蔣英獨唱會之後的一個出色的個人音樂會，筆者樂於爲讀者概括地先介紹幾個特殊的節目。</p>
<p>這次演唱的包括中外各家的歌曲作品，和一個選自伏第（Verdi）的歌劇「茶花女」中的」飲酒歌」。其中英國十七世紀末的大作曲家布舍爾（Puroell）底「我從愛情的紛擾中逃出而飛翔」（I　attempt　from　Love's　Sickness　to　fly）—選自戲劇「印后」中的劇樂插曲，歌曲之王舒柏特底「魔王」（Erlkonig）柴可夫斯基底「孤獨的心」（None　But　the　Lonely　Heart）和歌劇「卡門」作曲者比才的「羔羊經」（Agnus　Dei）等，都是久已燴炙人口的歌曲。</p>
<p>關於中國作曲家的作品，他選了江定仙的「國殤」，賀綠汀的「嘉陵江上」，趙元任的「敎我如何不想他」，這都是音樂聽衆早已熟悉的名曲，我要特別介紹和推薦的是伍敎授這次所唱的三首我國邊疆的民歌：</p>
<p>（一）「在那遼遠的地方，」青海民歌，陳田鶴配伴奏，</p>
<p>（二）「馬車夫之歌，」新疆民歌，嚴良堃配伴奏。</p>
<p>（三）康定情歌，西康民歌，江定仙配伴奏。</p>
<p>這三首民歌，不但已是邊疆極流行的曲子，而且情調與風格都非常特別，聽起來一定有新鮮的感覺。</p>
<h3>「失去的週末」</h3>
<p>— 曼</p>
<p>「失去的週末The　LostWeekend」是去年度一部最動人的戲劇，會獲得電影藝術學院四項金像獎，計最佳演員書米倫，最佳導演皮萊惠爾德，最佳劇本，査爾斯勃萊克與皮萊惠爾德，最佳監製人査爾斯勃萊克。現在此片已運到上海，將於最近期內在國泰公映。</p>
<p>「失去的週末」劇情，是寫一個酒徒的縱酒故事，他屢次戒酒，都沒有成功，甚至爲了想喝酒而去偸人家的東西，爲了想喝酒而引起心中的慚媿與痛恨，險些兒自殺。演出異常緊張，雷米倫的內心表演，有極大的成就。</p>
<h3>裕仁走向街頭</h3>
<p>— 苞卿</p>
<p>近東京日報載稱，日皇於政局解決以後，即將出巡京都，大阪和歌山等地。這過去是「承祖宗之遣業，踐萬世一系之帝位」，而今後「爲日本國之象徵，爲日本國民統合之象徵」的神武天皇子孫，知道從前「國家統治之大權，朕承之於祖宗，傳之於子孫」，而公是「其地位基於主權所在之日本國民之總意」了。他瞭解時代和環境的必然性，所以在戰爭結束後的第一個元且，頒詔下來，就說自己不是神，人民不要相信神話，這樣，裕仁公開的在日本史上破天荒的聲明，開始表示了他要親近民衆，要切實的抓住國民的總意了。第二步的行動，就是走向街頭，接近民衆。</p>
<p>如像去年二三月中：二月十九日，他穿了輕便西裝，坐了汽車，沿途沒有警戒，竟跑到東京附近，神奈川縣川崎，鶴見，横浜等地，視察戰後的工廠，市政和民衆住宅區的復興情形。三月一日，又跑到東京附近地方，視察戰災孤兒的生活，和去農業會倉庫有農民向政府徵米，他和兼任農業會長的區長的談話，　被灌了錄音片。</p>
<p>去年十一月，國際新聞社記者楊格，從日本來滬，談及目睹裕仁巡視名古屋時，候駕之民衆長到達十八哩，老幼都有。且說曾被下今禁止懸掛之三萬幀日皇照片，由制服裝改爲平民服裝而又復出現。</p>
<p>當日本新憲法成立時，裕仁夫婦會坐馬車出宮。在宮前接受民衆的歡呼，可是亦僅二三萬人圍觀而已。到本月三日，慶祝新憲實施時，情况更蕭條，在寒風細雨之下，冒雨至宮前慶祝者，不過一萬人左右。裕仁左右已有氣候不佳不必參加之勸，他仍監持參加，也只是在廣塲上出現三分鐘而已。在實施新憲前一日，且還舉行了歷史上空前的記者招待會，直接和記者問答了一些不重要的事。</p>
<p>在保守勢力下的日本人民，眼睛總是亮的，也知道時代的輪在前進，何况日皇宣佈不是神。所以有的人民的看法，以爲日皇不是神了，那麽有無都沒有關係；或是說旣然民主，也就不要日皇吧！不過老的一代還是贊成保留日皇的，即使是一個象徵也好。</p>
<h3>白象（中）</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>此後斑花猫常來，牠也常去，大家不以爲奇。我覺得白象更可愛了。因爲牠不像魯迅先生的猫，戀愛時在屋頂上怪聲怪氣，噪得他不能讀書寫稿，而用長竹竿來打。後來牠的肚皮漸漸大起來了。約摸兩三個月之後，牠的肚皮大得特別，竟像一隻白象了。我們用一只舊箱子，把蓋拿去，作爲牠的產床。有一天，牠臨盆了，一胎五子，三只雪白的，兩隻斑花的。大家稱慶，連忙呌男工樟鴻到岳墳去買新鮮魚來給牠調將，女孩子們天天冲克寗奶乳給牠吃。</p>
<p>小猫日長夜大，二星期之後，都會爬動。白象育兒耐苦得很，日夜躺臥，讓五個孩子糾纏。牠的身體龐大，在五只小猫看來，好比一個丘陵。牠們恣意爬上爬下，好像西湖上的游客爬孤山一樣。這光景眞是好看！</p>
<p>不料有一天，一只小花猫死了。我的幼兒新枚，哭了一塲，拿一條美麗牌香烟的匣子，當作棺材，給牠成殮，葬在西湖邊的草地中。餘下的四隻，就特別愛惜。我家有七個孩子，三個在外，四偽在杭州，他們就把四隻小猫分領，各認一只。長女陳寳領了花猫，三女寗罄，幼女一吟，幼兒新枚，各領一只白猫。這就好比鄕下人把孩子過房給廟裏的菩薩一樣，有了保佑，長命富貴。大約因爲他們不是菩薩，不能保佑，過一回，一只小白猫又死了。剩下三只，一花二白，都很健康，看看已能吃魚吃飯，不必全靠吃奶了。白象的母氏劬勞，也漸漸减省。牠不必日夜躺着餵奶，可以隨時出去散步，或跳到女孩子們的膝上去睡覺了。女孩子們笑牠：「做了母親還要別人抱？」牠不理，管自睡在你懷裏。</p>
<h3>白象及其五子</h3>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>他的心緒現在是更亂了，以前許多人常誇他最會想辦法，他自己雖沒有公然承認，心裏也未嘗不以此自負，因爲他懂得各種人的心理，知道用什麽方洗去對付什麽人。並且他還有一種硬挺的精神，分明已經絕望的事，他往往故意把它看得很樂觀，拼着命繼續幹去；用道方法倒的確使他解決了不少難事，然而今天的問題實在太困難。他幾乎不敢再信任自己了。</p>
<p>他垂着頭，咬緊了牙齒，忽忽地往前走，他覺得這條路似乎比來的時候長了許多，老像走不完似的。</p>
<p>當他再回到公路檢查所的時候。那邊的情形已比方才熟鬧了許多，有四輛從宜山開來的車子正停在那兒，打車上走下來休息的人和等在那裏想搭車的人混成了一片。劇團裏也有七八個人夾雜在裏面。</p>
<p>祝兆年想擠到車子旁邊去看一看究竟，　頭就碰到慮前。</p>
<p>「不行，沒有希望！」他一瘤一拐的搶着迎上來。「車篷上全是人了，一個也上不去。」</p>
<p>老祝皺了皺着尖，他隱約可以聽到盧前勉强嚥住了一聲將發未發的長嘆。</p>
<p>在人叢裏最活躍而又最神氣的是四個一色穿夏布夏威爽衫和黄卡基短褲的人，他們顯然就是這四輛車上的司機；大夥兒的人全隨在他們後面，來來去去的亂轉，敬烟的敬烟，陪笑臉的陪笑臉，眞像捧鳳鳳似的。</p>
<p>瞅着四輛車上所漆的「貿易委員會」五個白色的大將沉思了半响的祝兆年，忽然伸手從褲袋裏掏出了一册很敝舊的懷中日記來，怱怱地翻看着。</p>

Their forces are dispersed, and their supply lines are difficult, making a disastrous defeat possible at any time. Currently, there are minor skirmishes north of Kaiyuan and in southern Liaoning, but they will have no major impact. As for the Communist army's intentions, they are merely to plunder supplies, disrupt transportation, and conscript able-bodied men. They have no ambition to attack fortified cities. He stated that Changchun's situation is as important as Shenyang's. When asked whether he would inspect Jilin, he replied with a smile that it was possible.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changchun, 30th] Army Commander Pan Yu-kun told reporters that he had not yet received an official report of the Eastern Mongolian Army (i.e., the old troops of Ma Zhanshan) occupying Harbin, but he believed it was highly possible.

<h3>Legislative Yuan Appoints Nine Committee Members to Discuss Ways to Ease Student Unrest; Hu Shi Discusses the Student Movement in Peiping</h3>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 30th] Hu Shi, President of Peking University, told foreign reporters today that it would not be fair to say that the recent student movement was directed by the Communist Party. In any country, if there is dissatisfaction with the political system and there are no democratic means to express that dissatisfaction, young students often take on the responsibility of political movements. This general formula can be applied to all countries. China's history of over 2,000 years since the Han Dynasty shows that the student movement is in line with this formula, such as the Xinhai Revolution and the later National Revolution, which were both student movements. The situation in Europe is also the same. Since the establishment of the University of Paris, there has never been a political movement that was not led by students. The Russian Revolution was also started by students. Today's Britain and the United States are exceptions. Both countries have appropriate institutions to express public opinion, and young people can study and relax in peace without having to hold demonstrations to seek political reform. Students across the country are now planning to hold an anti-civil war parade on June 2nd. Peiping may be able to avoid clashes at that time, but there is also some danger. Today's student movement, strikes, and parades cannot achieve any resolution. Peace and war are both matters for both sides, and the issues are complex, which students do not seem to understand. If students believe that they should participate in politics, they should leave school and actively participate in the political arena.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] At the temporary meeting held by the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 30th to discuss the student unrest, the following two temporary motions were passed: (1) Proposed by Sun Jiulu and others, the general assembly would appoint a number of legislators to immediately study ways to ease the student unrest, go to the universities to persuade students to resume classes as soon as possible, and maintain contact with the Executive Yuan to urge the fair acceptance of student demands within a reasonable scope; Resolution: Chen Guyuan, Liu Kejun, Fu Tongxian, Jiang Shoushi, Lu Fu, Tan Tiwu, Sun Jiulu, Xia Taosheng, Sun Qu and other nine legislators were appointed to study methods of easing the situation immediately and start work. (2) Proposed by Chen Haicheng and others, it was suggested that local public opinion organs and professors should jointly persuade students to resume classes as soon as possible. At the same time, the government was advised to abolish the temporary measures to maintain social order at an appropriate time and to reform the political system. Resolution: Passed and submitted to the government. After the Legislative Yuan passed the above resolutions, Liu Kejun and other committee members held a discussion meeting that day to exchange opinions. They will meet with student representatives in the coming days to persuade them, listen to their opinions, and convey them to the government.</p>
<h3>Minister Zhu Responds to Student Unrest Issues at the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>Encourage resumption of classes using educational methods</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 30th] Zhu Jiahua replied to questions regarding student unrest at the temporary meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 30th, stating: The causes of this student unrest are extremely complex. Insufficient funding and inadequate facilities in various schools have led to student unrest and vulnerability to external stimulation, and their actions have failed to follow the right path. Therefore, since before and after the outbreak of student unrest, the Ministry has been using educational methods to patiently guide them, hoping to eliminate it invisibly. Regarding the middle school and university entrance examinations, there are original systems. The official announcement of this year's entrance examination was issued in March. While various regions were preparing, the social situation was not very stable. It has been approved to postpone it for another year at the request of the educational bureaus of various provinces and cities. The university entrance examination was created during the War of Resistance. Last year and this year, due to restoration relations, schools have been handling it based on the actual situation. The establishment of the British University in Jinhua was a decision made at the National Education Post-War Restoration Conference based on the principle of balanced educational development. Most of the problems at Jiaotong University are based on rumors and misunderstandings. The main issue is the demand to restore the navigation and marine engineering departments, which is not suitable from the perspective of the school system. I approved their request in response to repeated requests from the local authorities in Shanghai. Regarding the public funding system and the public-funded students' demand to increase their benefits, the current public-funded students receive two dou and three sheng of rice, and the non-staple food allowance has been adjusted to 46,000 yuan per month. Based on the current rice price, student public funding has reached over 120,000 yuan per month (in areas such as Nanjing and Shanghai). If we must increase the non-staple food allowance to 100,000 yuan per month, it would not only be unsustainable for the national treasury but also unreasonable. I have dedicated myself to education for nearly 30 years. As you gentlemen said, I also participated in the youth movement in my early years and deeply understand student psychology. Therefore, since before and after the outbreak of the student unrest, I have always been protecting the youth and repeatedly sent important personnel from the Ministry to guide them. Since the outbreak of the student unrest, the Ministry has also frequently gathered the presidents of various schools and department heads to discuss and encourage students to cherish their studies and resume classes as soon as possible. All methods of persuasion have been exerted to the best of our ability. This is how we have dealt with it in the past, and we will continue to do so in the future, properly planning to quell it; however, young students should prioritize their studies during their studies. The government loves students, just like parents love their children, and should not be too indulgent. As for the difficulties students feel, the Ministry will do its best to resolve them within its capabilities. In the future, we will allocate more funds and seek further improvements, so that teachers can be content with teaching and students can be happy to graduate, and education across the country can progress in stability.</p>
<h3>Students at National Central University Sign Petitions Advocating Immediate Resumption of Classes</h3>
<p>Railway College in Peiping to resume classes on June 2nd</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] After the administrative meeting of National Central University published a letter to students on the 29th, the students were very moved, and the majority of students have signed petitions advocating the immediate resumption of classes.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Peiping, 30th] The Railway College is scheduled to resume classes on June 2nd, and a joint council of professors, students, and alumni has been formed to organize a "Resumption Committee" and has elected seven members to continue to negotiate with the Ministry of Education. Furthermore, a general meeting of students from the Beiyang Engineering Department, originally scheduled to be held today to decide on the date for resuming classes, failed due to insufficient attendance.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 30th] Regarding the resumption of classes at Henan University, the opinions of students, professors, and the school administration are converging. The school administration discussed the resumption of classes on the afternoon of the 29th and decided that the Academic Affairs Office would notify the professors to resume classes immediately. The resumption of classes can be expected soon. More than 200 students from this year's graduating class have requested to take the exams on time on June 2nd (Monday) as scheduled, so there should be no problem with students resuming classes.</p>
<h3>Patriotic Protection of Education Movement in All Middle Schools in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] After the students of the Fifth Municipal Middle School launched a patriotic protection of education movement to "oppose strikes and fight for continued learning freedom," middle schools across the city responded, and more than 30 schools have joined, formally establishing the "Nanjing Patriotic Protection of Education Student Union" at Saoyemo on Qingliang Mountain on the 28th. On the 29th, they actively launched a publicity campaign, pointing out that this student unrest was an exposure of the conspiracy of the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic League, and issued a declaration. On the 30th, more than 100 students from various schools rode in six trucks to conduct anti-strike publicity in the city, which received sympathy from the community. Furthermore, the association sent representatives to visit Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Political Consultative Conference, at 6 PM to submit a letter to the Political Consultative Conference, proposing the following specific opinions: (A) Hopes for the government: (1) Establish a clean, honest, and efficient political style and resolutely punish corruption. (2) Be true to its word regarding various decisions and plans. (3) Immediately take thorough and effective measures to salvage the current economic crisis. (4) Strictly enforce laws and regulations to maintain social order and protect the safety of the people. (5) Openly suppress the rebel party that harms the country and the nation to reassure the people. (6) Value education and culture and increase funding. (B) Hopes for the Chinese Communist Party: (1) Quickly abandon the policy of violence, stop the so-called "three strikes and one tragedy." (2) Practice the slogan of "opposing civil war, stop the rebellion, and return the military to the country." (3) Give students, workers, and farmers quiet schools, factories, and villages. (4) Abandon cruel methods such as struggle, assassination, and liquidation and become a true political party. (5) Do not rape public opinion, engage in malicious slander, or make unfounded rumors in propaganda. (6) Stop all provocative and destructive political struggles. (7) Recognize that they are descendants of the Yellow Emperor.</p>

<h3>Discussions in the Legislative Yuan: Student Representative Attends as Observer</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Legislative Yuan held a temporary meeting on the morning of the 30th to discuss the student movement issue. President Sun concurrently presided. Over a hundred legislators attended. Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Lisheng, and Dong Xianjue were present to answer questions. A student representative also attended as an observer. Zhang Qun was absent due to other engagements. During the meeting, various legislators offered several constructive suggestions on how to handle the current student movement, hoping it could be guided properly. The closure of newspapers was also mentioned, and it was hoped that the ban could be lifted soon or that the case could be transferred from military to judicial authorities for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>The first legislator to speak today was Chen Guyuan, who, in addition to his role as a legislator, also teaches at Fudan University in Shanghai and is therefore very familiar with the truth of the student movement. Chen believes that the best way to handle the student movement is through guidance. He suggested three basic measures: (1) Emphasize the role of professors in providing guidance. Although professors may have different ideologies, they all have a sense of responsibility towards the country, and students trust them. This is more effective than if President Tian of the school were to come forward to provide guidance. (2) The government should invite relevant figures from various schools and knowledgeable individuals, such as senators and legislators, to go to the schools to provide guidance. (3) It is not against the law for students to be involved in politics. According to the constitution, citizens over the age of 23 have the right to be elected as legislators and supervisors. The government should allow students to participate in politics within legal boundaries.</p>
<h3>Inviting Reputable Figures to Offer Sincere and Open Guidance</h3>
<p>The next speaker was Traditional Hsien, who is also a professor at St. John's University in Shanghai. Mr. Fu pointed out that student movements can be divided into three stages. Regarding future handling, in the passive aspect, the "Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order" should be repealed. In the active aspect, it is best to replace pressure with guidance, and the government should invite reputable, impartial, and enlightened figures to engage in sincere and open discussions with the students. Lu Fu, a former member of parliament in the early Republic, pointed out that educational administration is different from other administrations. It should only be active and not passive. He hoped that the authorities would pay more attention to proactive actions in all future measures. As for the student movement issue, it is inevitable both in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad. The key is to guide it according to the circumstances. Hasty and panicky actions will not help but will only increase disturbances. He hoped that the matter would be handled carefully and that the Zhujiang Road incident would not be repeated.</p>
<p>Zhong Tianxin pointed out sadly that this student movement has its political nature, but the students did not put forward anti-government slogans, which proves that they have not lost hope in the government and do not have much hope in the Communist Party either. Two points are worth considering when dealing with the student movement: (1) Reasonable non-political demands should be adopted. (2) For political demands, it is hoped that a delegation can be formed to go to the Communist-controlled areas to call for peace. If this can be achieved, it is the wish of the people of the whole country. If there are still no results, then who wants peace and who does not want peace will be clear to the world. Chen Ruyan also believes that the main reason for the student movement is politics, and hopes that the government can play the role of a revolutionary leader. Cheng Yuanzhen pointed out that there is an inseparable relationship between the National Government and the students, and that today's students are even more lovable than those of 20 years ago. Their legitimate demands should be met. Xia Taosheng and other Youth Party legislators believe that the most effective way to solve the current student movement is for all parties to withdraw from schools.</p>
<p>During the meeting, various legislators also raised questions about the closure of the three newspapers. From a legal point of view, Lu Fu believed that the authorities' handling of this matter needs to be reconsidered. Tan Tiwu asked why the newspapers were not warned before being closed. Chen Guyuan pointed out that the imposition of martial law in Shanghai should be ratified by the Legislative Yuan. Zhou Yizhi hoped that the matter could be changed from military to judicial handling.</p>
<p>Today, legislators spoke eloquently about the stories of Zhaojialou and Tiananmen that year, while the student representative, who was twenty years younger, sat to the left of Minister Zhu, a former leader of the student movement, and was questioned together. Although the atmosphere was serious, from a historical point of view, it was indeed an interesting contrast.</p>
<h3>People's Political Council Continues to Hold General Meeting Today to Review Peace Proposals Case of Absorbing Floating Capital at High Interest Rates Has Been Cancelled</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The People's Political Council will hold a general meeting starting on the 31st to begin discussing proposals. The review work was completed on the evening of the 30th, with all 455 cases reviewed. The special review committee for reviewing the peace issue and related proposals is scheduled to be held at 8 p.m. on the 31st. People's Political Council members who have not participated in the special review committee can freely participate in the review work. The agenda of the general meeting is scheduled for three days, from the 31st to June 2nd. Meetings will be held in the morning and afternoon of each day. The secretariat of the general meeting has notified all People's Political Council members on the 30th that if there are too many cases and they cannot be completed within the scheduled date, it may be extended.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] During the review meeting of the People's Political Council on the 30th, there was a heated debate when reviewing the case of absorbing floating capital at high interest rates. Qian Xin Zhi said: If the interest rate of the national bank is raised to more than 10%, then the black market interest rate may be higher than 20% or 30%. Moreover, with such interest on interest, the country's expenditure will increase, inflation will rise, and floating capital will definitely increase. Therefore, not only is the high-interest rate method not feasible, but the recent rumor of issuing high-tech short-term treasury bonds is also inappropriate. As a result, the case was rejected.</p>
<p>[United Press Nanjing, 30th] Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan told reporters today: "The government is willing to negotiate peace, provided that the Chinese Communist Party has sincerity: First, they should abandon the demand to restore the military status of January 13th last year and abolish the constitution. Second, they should agree to restore transportation. The improvement of the economic situation depends on the restoration of transportation. Even if the civil war does not stop, we still hope to restore transportation to reduce the economic crisis." Zhang also said that the traffic on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has almost been restored to the border of Hebei and Shandong, and the section in the hands of the Communist army will soon be controlled by the government. Although the CCP is taking a large-scale offensive in the Northeast, the situation is not very bad. As for whether the National Army will recover the points occupied by the Communist army, it is a matter of military strategy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Mr. Liang Shuming of the Democratic League came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. On the 30th, he told reporters that the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is essentially a cultural conflict. The root of politics lies in culture. Only when everyone has a fundamental understanding of the issue, deeply examines it, and abandons superficial and impetuous attitudes, will the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have the possibility of rapprochement. Liang also said that the People's Political Council's call for peace has failed. Liang is scheduled to return to Beijing tonight to attend the People's Political Council. On the 3rd, he will leave Beijing and return to Chongqing. He is currently engaged in writing the book "Characteristics of Chinese Culture," which will take five more months to complete.</p>

<h3>Rumors of Abolishing Foreign Exchange Controls Are Inaccurate Executive Yuan Holds Review Meeting Yesterday to Revise Organizational Regulations of the Foreign Exchange Review Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] A senior official of the Ministry of Finance said on the 30th: The rumor in Shanghai that foreign exchange controls will be abolished is completely inaccurate, because whether from the perspective of the domestic situation or other factors, now is not the time to abolish controls.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The review meeting of the Executive Yuan was held on the morning of the 30th, chaired by Zhang Qun. The meeting discussed the supply of rice and coal. Since the source of coal is still in the Northeast, and the situation in the Northeast is turbulent, the first step is to find ways to facilitate transportation to transport the coal stored in the Northeast to the Nanjing and Shanghai areas for supply. The rice issue also adopted the method of mutual exchange and unimpeded transportation. There is no fear of a shortage of coal and rice. In addition, the organizational regulations of the Foreign Exchange Review Committee were also revised.</p>

<h3>Xie Bingxin Speaks to Youth Corps Members About Impressions of Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] Famous writer Ms. Xie Bingxin, recently returned from Japan to attend the Political Participation Council, spoke to over two thousand Youth Corps members at 7 p.m. on the 29th about her impressions of Japan. The main points were as follows:</p>
<p>Clothing, Food, and Housing are All Difficult</p>
<p>After arriving in Tokyo, I realized the extent of the war's destruction there was more than a thousand times worse than in Chongqing. After 8 p.m., it was difficult to see anyone on the streets. The housing shortage in Tokyo is currently severe. Original houses were either burned down, bombed, or left standing. The more orderly ones were requisitioned by the Allied forces. As a result, Japanese civilians often squeeze eight people into a small tatami room. Because some people live in the countryside, transportation is also a problem. People are often crushed to death on the subway. Food is very scarce. If you try to buy food at a restaurant, you probably will not succeed nine out of ten times. Speaking of clothing, the Japanese Emperor, when he appeared on May 3rd to accept the cheers of the people, was wearing a worn-out Western suit. Generally, professors and students wear tattered clothes. If they have a relatively decent pair of shoes, they only dare to wear them when meeting important guests.</p>
<p>Women Are Both Lovely and Sad</p>
<p>Japanese women are the most lovely, but also the most pitiable. They have no status in the family or in society and politics. Even the leading Japanese women's magazines, "Shufu no Tomo" (Housewife's Companion) and "Fujin Kōron" (Women's Public Opinion), are edited by men. Some female council members came to present me with flowers and fruit, accompanied by male council members. When I asked them something, the male council members answered on their behalf. I know a family where the husband studied in England and the wife studied in the United States, both studying politics. At home, they never exchange words about academic matters other than daily necessities. Under MacArthur's administration, the Japanese education system has been changed to a 6-6-4 system: six years of elementary school, six years of middle school, and four years of university. All universities are open to female applicants, but male students generally do not approve. This is different from China's May Fourth era, when women demanded equal access to education, and men were very enthusiastic about this movement.</p>
<p>Youth Are Innocent and Lively</p>
<p>The students are all innocent and lively. When I lectured at the National University in Xijing (i.e., Kyoto), I found that many of them spoke fluent Mandarin Chinese. It was difficult to distinguish whether they were Chinese or Japanese. Upon asking, I learned that they had never been to China; they had only studied Chinese language at a foreign language school for four years. American and British youth are now engaged in a correspondence movement with Japanese youth to establish good friendships. Japanese youth hope that Chinese youth can correspond with them more and exchange publications. I have talked to many professors who are not only knowledgeable but also very polite, listening attentively to your speech, very quietly and peacefully, even during meals. Perhaps this is because they eat a lot of fish, as fish are silent (loud applause throughout the venue).</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Are Treated Well</p>
<p>The treatment of overseas Chinese in Japan now is certainly better than before the war. Many rations are given preferentially. The Chinese military delegation stationed in Japan has a larger site than the embassy in any other country. It is divided into four groups: military, political, economic, educational, and cultural. There are over one hundred people working, and the total number, including family members and workers, is over two hundred. They live together as an organic whole, and everyone is happy and loving. The house we live in is large, with a large auditorium. It is also very convenient for us to go anywhere, with cars and jeeps at our disposal.</p>
<p>Lack of Capable Leaders</p>
<p>I believe the reason Japan has reached this point is the lack of a capable leader. We, on the other hand, should now use the power of love to care for them, just as we would forgive a younger brother who has done something wrong. Forgive them, because after all, China and Japan share the same script and ethnicity. Those who have a bit of sense admire and appreciate China.</p>
<p>Moving Towards Democratic Revival</p>
<p>Many people are afraid of Japan's revival, which is wrong. What we should fear is our own failure to revive. Although Japan has suffered major wounds from the war, and lacks basic necessities such as alkali, sugar, oil, and salt, it is nevertheless gradually moving towards democracy and revival under MacArthur's support. Looking back at ourselves, I feel extremely pained.</p>
<p>Transportation is so difficult that I may not return to China for another year or two. I hope that China will be a democratic, unified, prosperous, and happy country by then.</p>

<h3>The Consequences of "Unfreezing" the Cost of Living Index</h3>
<p>The "unfreezing" of the cost of living index, which has been anticipated by all parties, was announced yesterday by the city's Cost of Living Index Review Committee. The total worker index for this month in the city is 23,534 times, calculated as 23,500 times. The total employee index is 16,357 times, calculated as 16,400 times. These figures are nearly three times higher compared to the January worker index of 7,946 times and the employee index of 6,614 times. Of course, we are not surprised. In these short three months, due to the rise in general prices, the multiple of the cost of living index will have such an increase. What worries us is that, on the one hand, the announcement of this figure indicates that the effects of inflation will worsen, and the national economic crisis will deepen. On the other hand, the "unfreezing" of the cost of living index will be used as a standard for general wage calculation, making it impossible for industrial and commercial enterprises to bear the burden, causing them to further decline, and bringing the national economy to the brink of bankruptcy. The result of this may lead to greater insecurity in the lives of the general population!</p>
<p>Originally, the announcement of the cost of living index did not have a serious impact on the lives of the general population. As a result of inflation, the rise in prices and the decline in currency value are constantly progressing. Those who depend on wages or salaries for a living find it insufficient to sustain themselves if their wages or salaries remain fixed while prices continue to rise. With the daily increase in living expenses, the standard of living can only decline. However, the decline in the standard of living has its limits, while the increase in living expenses, under inflation, has no end. Under these circumstances, using the cost of living index as a standard for calculating wages or salaries is justified. In February of this year, drastic fluctuations swept across various city markets. The government announced an emergency economic measures plan to save the serious crisis of the national economy, which was unavoidable for the government. In this emergency economic measures plan, there was a provision to "freeze" the cost of living index; wages and salaries should no longer be based on the monthly cost of living index, and the monthly cost of living index should no longer be announced. Instead, the January cost of living index would be used as the standard for wages and salaries, with the provision to issue necessary goods or differential payments based on price conditions. The effectiveness of this method hinges on whether the government can control price fluctuations and prevent them from rising wildly. The purpose of "freezing" the cost of living index was to stabilize prices. In this sense, we welcome the promulgation of this emergency measures plan. However, the causes of price fluctuations are not simple; relying solely on the "freezing" of the cost of living index cannot stabilize prices. In the past three months, they have become even more rampant. Under these circumstances, we cannot but sympathize with the demand to "unfreeze" the cost of living index.</p>
<p>Now the cost of living index is "unfrozen"; the increase in its figure has reached threefold in just three months. This means that employers who pay wages and salaries based on the cost of living index will bear a burden that is three times heavier. However, during the same period, their ability to bear the burden has not increased equally by three times. This heavy burden will make it impossible for them to bear it, bringing their businesses to the brink of bankruptcy. As a result, not only will the lives of employees not be protected, but the national economy will be in even more serious crisis. If the chicken is gone, how can there be eggs? Moreover, if general prices cannot be controlled, the multiple of the cost of living index will inevitably increase, while the employer's income will never catch up with the multiple increase in the cost of living index. What can result from this other than "bankruptcy"? Although the government has regulations for discounts on wages paid according to the cost of living index, in light of the sharp increase in the index, the employer's burden is still not reduced by much. If this situation continues to evolve, it will destroy the existing foundation of the national economy; we are really worried!</p>
<p>Originally, wages and salaries are an agreement between employers and employees. Under inflation, price changes are inevitable; how to have changes in wages and salaries based on price changes is a matter between employers and employees. If the government orders employers to pay wages and salaries based on the cost of living index, the necessary condition is that the government has the ability and confidence to control price changes, so that the cost of living index can become stable. If the government cannot control prices, it cannot force employers to bear the negative consequences of inflation. Furthermore, if the government has a policy of paying wages and salaries according to the cost of living index, it must also supplement it with a subsidy policy to reduce the employer's burden. Otherwise, if the employer's ability is not taken into account, the future of the national economy is really worrying. We hope that the government can have wise measures to resolve this unprecedented crisis.</p>

<h3>The Aims and Purposes of Establishing This School</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zhaoshao</p>
<p>Education is the foundation of a nation. The intelligence and ignorance, good and evil of the people, the prosperity and decline, rise and fall of the nation, all depend on the universality of education. Its importance goes without saying. Our nation's education has always been considered backward. Schools cannot reach all areas, resulting in a knowledge panic and a large number of illiterate people, especially women. Often, when ten people gather, none of them are literate. If we do not urgently seek remedies, the nation's future is truly unthinkable! The establishment of this school is precisely to meet the needs of the times, to increase the knowledge and skills of adult women who have missed education. I will briefly describe the aims and purposes of the establishment below:</p>
<p>(1) To Seek Opportunities for Remedial Education for Women Who Have Missed Education. Adult women who have missed education feel the inconvenience of lacking knowledge and skills. Although they aspire to seek knowledge and progress, they have no suitable school. Entering elementary school is difficult because they do not want to be with children, and entering middle school is difficult because their level is insufficient. Moreover, elementary and middle schools are full-day classes with many subjects, which does not seem suitable for women's environment and needs. Although remedial schools and public schools have been established in various parts of the country, they are either limited by time, hindering their family work, or their teaching materials are inappropriate, failing to meet their actual needs, or their facilities are simple, reducing their interest in learning, causing them to hesitate to move forward. This is not only a regrettable matter for women themselves but also affects the improvement of family and society. This school aims to remedy this defect. Therefore, it takes a different approach, slightly changing the system. Its facilities are different from ordinary remedial schools. The time can be chosen at will, and the subjects are not limited. Knowledge and skills are chosen according to needs to cater to women's environment, needs, and interests, so that adult women who have missed education can happily come to learn. This is one of the aims and purposes of the establishment of this school.</p>
<p>(2) To Seek Opportunities for Working Women to Learn Skills. Although gender equality has long been recognized in law, there is still a difference in reality. Taking employment as an example, only a small number of women can serve society. The reason for this is the lack of knowledge and skills. Women's studies have greater fluidity and often cannot last long. Therefore, only a few can receive complete education. Those who drop out of elementary and middle school without graduating and those who have never entered school are numerous. It is extremely difficult for them to establish themselves in society without relevant occupations. Therefore, this school has specially set up vocational subjects for women to learn a skill to achieve economic independence and not become appendages of men. This is the second aim and purpose of the establishment of this school.</p>
<p>(3) To Seek Opportunities for Housewives to Learn Common Sense of Housework. "Only when the family is in order can the state be governed" is an ancient saying. Therefore, whether the family is sound is sufficient to affect the governance and chaos of society and the country. Women are the pillars of the family, and their lives are tied to the lifeline of the whole family, their responsibilities being enormous. Everything from helping their husbands and teaching their children, sweeping and answering, cooking and tailoring, and handling miscellaneous affairs, large and small, all depend on the virtuous and wise housewife to manage, so that a harmonious and happy family can be created. However, such work is trivial and heavy. Without rich common sense and experience, it is difficult to cope with it. The saying "learn to be a woman before marrying" is wise! Therefore, this school has specially compiled and selected teaching materials on common sense of housework to instill various knowledge and skills in daily life. It also deeply understands the importance of maternal education, which is related to the future of children. It specially teaches methods of disciplining children and the psychology of children so that they can become models of virtuous wives and good mothers after graduation. This is the third aim and purpose of the establishment of this school.</p>
<p>In addition, after the school was opened, many female students preparing to enter higher education came to take remedial classes. Therefore, in addition to the above-mentioned aims and purposes, tutoring for female students preparing to enter higher education has also become one of the aims and purposes of the establishment of this school. In summary, this school is set up for adult women who have missed education, working women, and female students preparing to enter higher education. Its purpose is to teach women the knowledge, skills, and character needed in modern life, so that they can manage household affairs and serve society, so that all women in the country can give full play to their inherent talents to shoulder the great mission of building a new China.</p>
<h3>Brief History</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Shanghai Women's Remedial School was founded in August 1932, and it has been fifteen years since then. The founder, Zhou Zhaoshao, after graduating from the Department of Social Education of the College of Education of Great China University, served as the director of education at the Zhenjiang Public Education Center in Jiangsu Province and the director of the experimental public school attached to the Experimental Public Education School in Zhejiang Province. Based on his many years of research in social education, and in view of the fact that adult women in our country who have missed education have no opportunity to receive education, they cannot serve society to seek equality in employment for men and women, nor can they be good at managing their households to seek happiness in family life. Therefore, he rented No. 22 Yuanchang Lane, Hualong Road, Shanghai as a school building to establish this school, pioneering women's remedial education in our country. The founder himself served concurrently as the principal. On November 16 of the same year, he submitted a request to the Shanghai Education Bureau, which was approved for registration under Instruction No. 2395.</p>
<p>In July 1933, to promote the development of school affairs, Liu Wangliming, Wang Xiaoying, Jiang Wenyu, Zhou Feicheng, Chen Gongsu, Chen Heqin, Ma Zongrong (deceased), Gao Jianji (deceased), Cheng Junying, Zhang Yaoxiang, Dong Renjian, Zheng Tonghe, Pan Wenan, and Ou Yuanhuai were invited to serve as consultants to answer questions and fill in omissions.</p>
<p>In August 1934, in view of the vast area of Shanghai and to facilitate students' remedial studies nearby, the Jing'an Temple branch was added at No. 138 Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai. In the spring of 1935, the main school moved to a new building at No. 54 Hualong Road due to insufficient space in the original school building. In the autumn of 1936, the Jing'an Temple branch was reorganized into the First Branch and moved to No. 26 Difeng Road. In the spring of 1937, the Second Branch was added at No. 630 and 632 Baike Road. Wang Xiaolai and Yu Qingtang were also hired as consultants. Soon, the main school was renamed the First School, the First Branch was renamed the Second School, and the Second Branch was renamed the Third School. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the Second School was forced to close due to its location, and the Third School was promoted to the Second School.</p>
<p>Since 1938, the war has moved inland, and the number of residents in Shanghai has increased sharply. The school has a slight reputation, and the number of students has increased year by year, and the internal facilities have become increasingly complete. All aspects of the curriculum, the distribution of time, the teaching methods, and the selection of teaching materials all consider the practical needs of women and the convenience of learning, and constantly research and strive for improvement.</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in August 1945, according to the order of the Shanghai Education Bureau, the procedures for re-registration were carried out. Therefore, the board of directors was organized, and Tian Dazhi, Tao Xinqiao, Gu Yingchuan, Wu Gusheng, Wu Yizhi, He Zemin, Zhou Zhaoshao and others were responsible for handling the registration procedures, which were approved in February 1947. In April of this year, No. 17 Dielai New Village, Jing'an Temple Road, was rented to restore the Third School, so as to facilitate the schooling of women who had missed education in the west of Shanghai. It has now been renovated and started enrollment. It is scheduled to open on June 4 at the same time as the First School and the Second School.</p>
<p>In the past fifteen years, a total of 35,338 students have come to study, with 58,593 students in total, divided by subject. After teaching and edification, they can all share the responsibilities of society and family. However, the elimination of illiteracy among women and the supplementation of knowledge and skills still depend on the development of women's remedial education. Therefore, in the future, we not only want to make the framework more solid, but also strive to make the school flourish.</p>
<h3>School Song</h3>
<p>— Zhang Lunqing</p>
<p>Is the rise and fall of the world the responsibility of every man?</p>
<p>Pity our female compatriots, most of whom are illiterate! Do you also know that learning can cure ignorance, but you are addicted to pleasure, driven by poverty and hunger!</p>
<p>The phenomenon is like this! How can we talk about equality between men and women, the future of the country! Although the eastern corner is lost, there are mulberries and elms to be harvested!</p>
<p>I wish my peers to use the remaining time, knowledge and skills, each take what they need! Accumulate over time! Is it just a small supplement?</p>
<p>The soil can become Mount Tai, and drops of water can become rivers and lakes! Strive! Strive! Now I overcome myself because of my past.</p>
<h3>General Overview of Our School</h3>
<p>— He Zemin</p>
<p>Since the term "Adult Education" was introduced from the East, many contemporary figures have been eager to catch up and engage in it. However, due to its initial stage, biases were unavoidable, leading to the neglect of adult illiterate women. Mr. Zhou Zhenshao, the founder and principal of our school, recognizing this deficiency, took the lead in establishing a women's supplementary school, aiming to fill the gap in our national education system. From the very beginning, the path was fraught with challenges, and the operations were arduous. Eventually, thanks to the guidance of enlightened members of society and the effective management of Principal Zhou, the school was able to achieve its current scale. As we approach the fifteenth anniversary of the school, I am presenting an overview of our school to seek corrections from the nation.</p>
<p>I. Organization and Structure For the purpose of adapting to practical needs and enhancing administrative efficiency, the organization of our school strives for simplicity, ensuring that each task has a dedicated responsibility and each individual performs their duty. The principal, following the decisions of the Board of Directors, has full authority to handle school affairs. Under the principal, there is a secretary, followed by five sections: Documentation, Accounting, General Affairs, Academics, and Library. Each section has one to two officers. All administrative matters within the school are discussed in school affairs meetings attended by all staff members; matters related to teaching and guidance are discussed in teaching and guidance meetings attended by all faculty members. In addition, there are subject-specific teaching research groups to improve teaching in each subject.</p>
<p>The structure of academic levels in our school differs from that of ordinary schools due to the difference in nature. In terms of subjects, there are Chinese, English, Mathematics, Stenography, Typing, Home Economics, and Music. In terms of time, there are morning, afternoon, and evening classes. In terms of level, it ranges from beginner to advanced. In terms of teaching methods, there are class-based teaching, mixed-level teaching, and individualized teaching. Based on the convenience and needs of the enrollees, subjects and times can be freely selected.</p>
<p>II. Overview of Teaching and Guidance Education is a tool for improving life, and the school's role for students is not only to enlighten them with knowledge but also to guide and improve their overall lives. The student body of our school comes from diverse backgrounds, and most are adult women, so there are no established rules to follow for teaching and guidance, and we must explore alternative approaches. Teaching facilities are based on the students' psychology and needs, and to promote teaching efficiency, we adopt a teaching and guidance integration system, so that the responsibility of guidance extends to all teachers, and students' intelligence, thinking, and character can be developed simultaneously. The teaching and guidance overview is listed separately below:</p>
<p>A. Teaching and Guidance Goals: To provide a consistent and concrete plan for teaching and guidance, our school has formulated ten major teaching and guidance goals based on the educational purpose of the Republic of China as a guideline for implementation:</p>
<p>(1) Enrich women's practical knowledge (2) Enhance women's productive skills (3) Cultivate women's good character (4) Develop women's industrious habits (5) Promote women's physical exercise (6) Improve women's leisure entertainment (7) Guide women's homemaking experiences (8) Train women's group living (9) Stimulate women's service interests (10) Inspire women's patriotic thought</p>
<p>B. Teaching and Guidance Principles: (1) Based on the characteristics of women's psychology and physiology (2) Focus on the guidance and effectiveness of adult learning (3) Suitable for the allocation and utilization of learning time (4) Observe the purpose and needs of students' further study (5) Refer to the principles and methods of general teaching</p>
<p>C. Teaching Methods: Because our school is special in nature, the teaching methods are interesting, active, and improving, with the principle of inspiring students' self-learning. Therefore, they vary depending on the subject and differ according to the individual, with no fixed method to follow. Teachers constantly research and improve based on their practical teaching experience. The teaching methods are divided into three types:</p>
<p>(1) Class Teaching This is the most common teaching method, which involves gathering students of the same level and teaching them with the same teaching materials.</p>
<p>(2) Mixed-Level Teaching Our school generally uses class teaching for various subjects, but when the number of students in a certain subject is too small, mixed-level teaching is used to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>(3) Individualized Teaching All technical subjects generally use individualized teaching. Our school hires specialized talent to serve as teachers, so that students can apply what they learn.</p>
<p>D. Key Points of Guidance: The guidance affairs of our school adopt a tutor system, in which teachers of each subject provide guidance directly or indirectly based on the key points of guidance. The implementation method is to first inspire students' good motives to change old habits in women's lives. Teachers lead by example, pay attention to the influence of personality, and use positive suggestion methods to subtly influence students. The key points of guidance are as follows: 1. Civic Training: (1) Health: Healthy body and happy mind (2) Agility: Alert and agile, quick in action (3) Precision: Careful thinking, clear discernment, precise judgment (4) Humility: Humble attitude, kind to others (5) Honesty: Trustworthy and reliable, realistic and pragmatic (6) Compassion: Filial piety and love for children, love for people and things (7) Diligence and Thrift: Hardworking and enduring, thrifty and frugal (8) Politeness: Polite in words and deeds, elegant in manner (9) Responsibility: Responsible service, never shirking (10) Enterprise: Progressive thinking, continuous improvement (11) Courage: Bold and careful, unafraid of difficulties and dangers (12) Enthusiasm: Chivalrous and righteous, helping the weak and supporting the poor (13) Sociability: United as one, united in purpose (14) Justice: Upholding justice, not seeking personal gain (15) Law-Abiding: Obeying regulations, abiding by laws (16) Patriotism: Sacrificing the individual, protecting the country and the people 2. Vocational Training: (1) The meaning of vocation (2) The analysis of vocation (3) The choice of vocation (4) The preparation of vocation (5) The cultivation of vocation (6) The effectiveness of vocation (7) The adjustment of vocation (8) The improvement of vocation (9) The success of vocation 3. Home Affairs Training: (1) The Function and Importance of the Family (2) The Responsibilities and Cultivation of the Housewife (3) Economic Management and Record Keeping (4) Clothing Tailoring and Preservation (5) Food Selection and Nutrition (6) Residence Sanitation and Arrangement (7) The Life and Care of the Sick (8) The Education and Management of Children (9) Family Health and Entertainment.</p>
<p>III. Curriculum and Teaching Materials The subjects offered by our school have special characteristics, so the curriculum content is different from that of ordinary schools. The Chinese language course is divided into six levels and includes Mandarin conversation. The curriculum includes readers, correspondence, general knowledge, applied writing, conversation, and calligraphy. The English language course is divided into five levels, with readers, grammar, conversation, correspondence, and calligraphy. The mathematics course is divided into five levels, with arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and spherical trigonometry. The bookkeeping course is divided into two levels, elementary commercial bookkeeping and advanced commercial bookkeeping. The typing course is divided into English typing and Chinese typing. The home economics course includes sewing, embroidery, and knitting, teaching clothing tailoring and sewing methods, machine embroidery methods, and wool knitting methods. The music course includes piano, harmonica, singing, and Peking opera, teaching piano and harmonica playing methods, various songs, and Peking opera, etc.</p>
<p>Selecting teaching materials is the most difficult aspect of supplementary schools. Most textbooks published on the market are not suitable for supplementary schools, either because the content is not appropriate or because the amount of teaching material is too large. Therefore, our school has formulated curriculum standards and compiled and printed our own teaching materials accordingly. The principles of compilation and selection focus on adapting to the psychology and needs of adult women in their lives, and each reprint is based on the opinions of the teachers, with additions and deletions to strive for continuous improvement. Practice has proven this approach to be very effective.</p>
<p>IV. Extracurricular Activities To increase students' knowledge and interest in learning, we cannot limit ourselves to the fixed scope of books. Extracurricular activities are also important. Based on the knowledge, skills, physical and mental health of the students, our school organizes various activities outside of class so that students can have proper entertainment and work in their leisure time and develop good habits. The methods are divided into regular and irregular types, which are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Regular: Regarding various academic and artistic competitions, the school stipulates the date, items, and methods at the beginning of each semester and holds them in sequence. In advance, the responsible teachers are responsible for guiding and practicing, and select the best to participate. Those who win the competition are given certificates and prizes to encourage them. The types of competitions include: Calligraphy, composition, general knowledge, literacy, rapid calculation, Chinese and English recitation, current affairs, dictionary checking, home economics, speech, singing, piano performance, Peking opera, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Irregular: The school has a library and entertainment room, where students can freely read books and newspapers after class and participate in various entertainment activities. Teachers also lead and organize sightseeing tours, women's issues research associations, etc., and participate in group gatherings outside the school.</p>
<p>In addition, each subject offered by our school has regular extracurricular assignments, which also fall within the scope of extracurricular activities. The Chinese language course has copying books, composing essays, making sentences, writing diaries, taking notes, and writing large and small regular scripts. The English language course has copying books, making sentences, translating, composing essays, and practicing writing. The exercises for the mathematics and bookkeeping courses are also mostly practiced outside of class. Although each subject has only one hour of class per day, the time spent on extracurricular assignments is more than one hour. The school's emphasis on extracurricular assignments has greatly benefited the students.</p>
<p>The overview of our school is roughly as described above. However, the internal rules and regulations and various records for the past fifteen years cannot be fully recorded due to space limitations. We are now planning to organize and compile them into a booklet and publish them for the reference of those who are concerned about women's supplementary education.</p>
<p>Statistics of Students in Various Subjects Over the Years</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Bevin Delivers Speech, Reviews the Overall World Situation, and Says that the Handling of Far East Issues Requires Utmost Care</h3>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague, 29th Dispatch] After listening to Foreign Secretary Bevin's 75-minute speech, the Labor Party Congress rejected, by a majority vote, all motions opposing Bevin's foreign policy. Bevin's speech began by stating Britain's position on the Far East peace treaty issue, demanding that the Potsdam method no longer be used in discussing the peace treaty with Japan, and that all eleven countries that had fought against Japan participate from the beginning to the conclusion of the treaty. Referring to the Far East situation, Bevin said that the danger in the Far East was no less than that in Europe. China had fallen into the pain of civil war, and Korea was an extremely dangerous point. He said that the situations in India, Burma, and the Dutch East Indies were also in turmoil. In short, Asia was undergoing major changes and needed to be handled with utmost care.</p>
<p>Bevin then addressed the Middle East issue, saying that we should bear a major responsibility for the establishment of independent Arab states there. The area has oil resources, and our policy is not limited to oil interests. We should encourage the social and economic development of the region.</p>
<p>He also discussed the German issue, saying that the recent agreement to establish an economic committee in the British and American zones of Germany was by no means intended to create a final division of Germany. It was only because other countries refused to unify the entire German economy that Britain and the United States had to take this temporary step. Regarding the Greek issue, he said that he would not apologize for Britain's intervention there. The civil war had broken out there, but Britain would not participate in its civil war. He felt that the most dangerous thing was the participation of powerful countries in the civil wars of small countries, which often led to major wars. After Britain withdrew from Greece, the United States would take over its responsibilities.</p>
<p>Finally, he said that at the beginning of his tenure, he had said that anyone who expected him to achieve significant results in four or five years would be disappointed, because the world had become fragmented, and the future was full of difficulties. Therefore, he had to maintain a patient attitude, hoping that the countries that had been negotiating since November of this year could finally reach an agreement.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Asks Britain for a Loan of 50 Million Pounds; British-Soviet Trade Negotiations to Resume</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 29th Dispatch] Authoritative sources say that the Soviet Union has asked Britain for a credit loan of 50 million pounds, with an annual interest rate of 1.5%, to be repaid in 15 years. The Soviet Union also told Britain that before any new British-Soviet trade agreement is signed, Britain must accept this loan request. It is said that the British government is still studying this proposal.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th Dispatch] Officials here recently said that British-Soviet trade negotiations will soon resume, which will greatly improve the political relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. However, the first problem to be solved in the trade negotiations is the conditions for the British loan to the Soviet Union to purchase British exports. It is said that the Soviet Union has proposed the following three conditions: (1) Installment repayment; (2) Reduce the interest rate to 0.5%; (3) Extend the installment repayment period to 16 years. All three of these are unacceptable to Britain. According to reports, Britain has announced that it cannot provide commercial loans to any foreign country. However, because Britain urgently needs Soviet wheat and timber, it has no choice but to lend to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>U.S. Army Budget Reduced by More Than 400 Million Dollars</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] Although U.S. Secretary of the Army Patterson warned that cutting military spending would weaken the post-war army's strength, the House Appropriations Committee today still reduced the army's 1948 budget by $475,800,977, or 8.3%. President Truman's Budget Bureau and national military leaders had requested $5,716,679,105 to strengthen the foundation of the U.S. Army, but now that it has been reduced by nearly $500 million, Patterson believes that the air force and the occupying forces will be particularly affected.</p>
<h3>Eisenhower Warns of Danger of U.S. Being Attacked</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th Dispatch] The U.S. House Appropriations Committee today discussed the military spending stipulated by President Truman for next year's budget. Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower was present to present his views, requesting the Appropriations Committee to approve it in its entirety. He said that the United States is extremely vulnerable to a sudden air strike and could be miserably defeated in a matter of hours. He deeply believes that if the United States cannot make its victory in World War II a safe victory, then what will follow will be a nightmare of death, terror, and destruction that no one has ever dreamed of. If a major war breaks out again in the world, the first to be attacked will not be Warsaw but Washington, not London but Los Angeles, and perhaps not even Pearl Harbor but Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 30th Dispatch] The United States and the Soviet Union are on the verge of a showdown over the issue of whether the veto power should be used to control the use of atomic energy. The issue of contention between the two sides is whether all control work in the atomic field should be subject to the veto power of the major powers in the United Nations Security Council. The Soviet Union today obtained a small resolution in the Standing Subcommittee of the Atomic Energy Commission of the United Nations, which has given the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union a preliminary form. The resolution proposed by the Soviet Union reaffirms the resolution of the General Assembly, that any international atomic control measures should work within the scope of the Security Council. This proposal has been unanimously approved by the Executive Subcommittee of the Commission. Although U.S. Deputy Representative Osborne voted in favor, he repeatedly emphasized that if this proposal is passed, the Soviet Union can demand that atomic control work be subject to the veto power. Osborne proposed an amendment, strongly advocating that a clause be inserted in the Soviet resolution stipulating that this proposal "in no way modifies the Committee's initial report," but his wish was not fulfilled. The debate on the veto power issue is scheduled to begin next week. The United States, Britain, and Canada all firmly believe that those who would destroy the atomic treaty must not be given a legal way to escape, so the use of the veto power must not be allowed in atomic control matters.</p>
<h3>U.S.-Soviet Joint Committee in a Standoff</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 29th Dispatch] According to responsible sources, the U.S.-Soviet Joint Committee discussed the issue of allowing Korean political parties to be present to present their views in the afternoon today. They could not agree on how many political parties should be allowed to present their views, resulting in a stalemate. The Soviet delegation proposed a limit of 30 political parties, saying that it would be almost impossible to solicit the opinions of all Korean political parties, because there are 180 political parties in the U.S. occupation zone alone. To save time, the U.S. representative also agreed to limit the number of political parties presenting their views, but believed that the number of 30 political parties was too small. The United States believes that a small number of political parties presenting their views would only benefit the left-wing parties, because there are fewer left-wing parties. For example, the Communist Party is the only political party in the Soviet occupation zone.</p>
<h3>Our Government Closely Watches the Future Development of the Japanese Political Situation; Katayama's Cabinet Formation Work to Be Completed Soon</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] Since the decision to have Socialist Party leader Katayama responsible for forming a cabinet in Japan, our government authorities have not made any formal statements, but are closely watching the progress of his cabinet formation. According to the impressions obtained by our agency's reporters from interviewing some people in the Political Participation Council who are concerned about Japanese issues, they all seem to have expectations for the success of the Socialist Party's cabinet formation, because the left wing of the Socialist Party has already broken ties with the Communist Party, and its right wing is more progressive than the members of the Liberal and Democratic Parties. Also, unlike some members of the Liberal and Democratic Parties, they have not been able to eradicate the militarist and aggressive thinking. According to a Nationalist Party expert on Far East issues, the reason why the Liberal Party refused to participate in the four-party coalition cabinet led by the Socialist Party is not so much because it truly opposes the left wing of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, but rather because it intends to use the anti-communist banner to ingratiate itself with the United States, in order to allow the party to rise again and come to power in the future, and to deceive the United States into providing aid to Japan. The Japanese Communist Party is different from the Chinese Communist Party. It has no armed forces, and it is difficult to launch riots and strikes under the control of the Allied forces.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] Socialist Party Secretary-General Nishio, upon learning of the Democratic Party's decision to participate in the Katayama cabinet at the afternoon's 6:00 p.m. meeting, released a statement that "when the Democratic Party's attitude is finally decided, the cabinet formation meeting of the Democratic, National Cooperative, and Socialist parties can be convened." From tonight, the work of selecting cabinet members will be carried out. After new candidates are put forward by each party, Prime Minister Katayama's opinions will be sought first, and then a meeting of the three party leaders will be held to make a decision. The procedures for reviewing the qualifications of cabinet members will be completed on the 31st, and the cabinet appointment ceremony is scheduled for the first day of next month.</p>

<h3>Japanese Business Community Opposes Using Products as Compensation</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] Recently, some people in the Japanese business community have opposed the Far East Commission Compensation Subcommittee's decision to use Japanese products as compensation. The reason they have given is that this method is sufficient to increase the inflation rate in Japan. Their purpose is still to use foreign resources obtained from future foreign trade of products to rebuild Japan's factory equipment that has been dismantled due to compensation.</p>
<h3>The Netherlands Presents Five Points of Proposals to Indonesia</h3>

<h3>Preventing the June 2nd Riot; Authorities Order Arrests of Communist Saboteurs; Over Eighty Students to Be Isolated</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan received reporters in the City Hall conference room at 5:30 PM yesterday, providing explanations regarding the arrest of Communist saboteurs. First, Mayor Wu clarified the city government's attitude toward this student unrest, stating: In March of this year, when the National Government ordered Communist elements to withdraw to Yan'an, the Communist office in this city claimed that there were only 34 Communist members in the city. Commander Xuan and I are responsible for local security and knew that the number of Communist members was far more than this. Although we could have used force to order their complete withdrawal at that time, the door to negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communists was not yet closed. It was generally believed that if the Communist elements who had infiltrated could remain peaceful and law-abiding, we would not resort to such measures. However, the reality was different; arson, strikes, beatings, and other actions disrupting public order occurred one after another. The city government had previously received intelligence stating that the Communist Party would choose factories, warehouses, and shantytowns in the city to carry out arson in order to disrupt public order. At the beginning of this month, the city government received intelligence again, stating that the Communist Party was plotting a major riot on June 2nd, inciting city-wide strikes of students, businesses, and workers. During this month, each school implemented strikes based on completely different issues, and then unanimously turned to the same political goal. Moreover, according to the city government's investigation, a small number of students in each school were indeed students with political backgrounds, and these students were the ones inciting the student unrest.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu continued: Based on the aforementioned facts, since they attempted to riot on June 2nd, if the city government allowed it to develop and punished them after the riot occurred, the damage to the citizens would be great. Therefore, we had to arrest the subversive rioters who had infiltrated each school in advance to prevent the occurrence of the riot, so that young students would not be incited by them. According to the city government's statistics, there are approximately 45,000 students in various universities in the city, among whom the number of subversive rioters is not small, but after repeated and careful review by the city government, it was determined that over eighty students had to be arrested. The authorities have compiled a list and are arresting them separately. Some students have already been arrested, and the remaining number will continue to be arrested within the next few days. Regarding the handling of the arrested students, Mayor Wu stated yesterday: We will try our best to be lenient, or transfer them to the Communist area separately. In addition, those who express repentance and provide a reliable guarantee may also be treated leniently. As for the method of guaranteeing, the city government and the garrison headquarters are drafting it.</p>
<h3>The Flames of Unrest Spread to Society; Actions Had to Be Taken to Avoid Affecting Public Safety; Commander Xuan Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Following Mayor Wu's speech, Commander Xuan then issued a statement, stating: (1) Some members of society believe that the recent turmoil is simply student unrest, and that the subversive elements arrested by the authorities are innocent students. This view does not reflect the truth. If students were to cause a student strike for their own interests, their actions would be limited to within the school, and the authorities would not want to interfere. However, this turmoil began in early May and has lasted for nearly a month. It has spread from universities to middle schools, becoming an unstoppable force, and has even attempted to incite factory strikes and business closures. Even military and police personnel have been the target of their subversive incitement. The slogans shouted and the posters pasted are no longer characteristic of student unrest. From this, it can be seen that this turmoil is indeed the Communist Party's entire plan to sabotage public order and overthrow the government. The instigators and agitators in each school are undoubtedly Communist Party agents who have been strategically deployed. (2) Some people believe that it is inappropriate for the military and police to interfere in student unrest, but now the flames of unrest are spreading from schools to society, affecting the safety of the entire city. It is the responsibility of the military and police authorities, and it is also the hope of the majority of citizens who need stability. Therefore, we have to take action to protect the majority of the people.</p>
<p>To Be Sent to the Communist Area</p>
<p>(3) Starting yesterday, it is planned to arrest over eighty students who are Communists and other Communist Party members. Of course, the number of Communists who have infiltrated this city is more than this, but we do not intend to arrest too many. We are now only selecting the most important ones who must be arrested. After repeated review, we have decided on over eighty people. We hope that other infiltrators can come to their senses on their own. As for those who have already been arrested, they will be isolated first, and if necessary, they will be sent away from Shanghai to the Communist area. They shout "Oppose the civil war," so they should also go to the Communist Party to shout that. (4) The over eighty people who have been decided to be arrested have not yet all been captured. This is because yesterday, the garrison headquarters used formal procedures to notify the principals of each school with an official letter listing the names and requesting that the listed students be handed over. However, because the principals of each school were unable to take full responsibility in advance, the military police had to be sent to arrest them themselves. Therefore, the Communist Party members in Jiaotong University probably knew that the authorities would not allow them to continue their activities, and most of them had already fled in advance. Therefore, the arrest work has not yet been fully accomplished.</p>
<p>List To Be Announced Soon</p>
<p>(5) The arrested Communists have all been investigated and have solid evidence against them. Their names will be announced by the city government soon. Also, among those arrested this time, there are several reporters. The authorities do not ask whether they are reporters or students. All who are major Communist Party members who conspire to incite turmoil and sabotage stability will be arrested. (6) A small number of students from one part of Jiaotong University are the main elements leading the turmoil and sabotaging public order. The majority of students in other schools are incited by these few people. As long as classes resume immediately, the authorities will not implicate the innocent. However, if the students still do not come to their senses and continue to attempt to riot in the June 2nd parade and launch strikes of workers and businesses, then the security authorities will be forced to take resolute measures.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Expels Eighteen Students</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Jiaotong University President Wu Baofeng issued a notice on the afternoon of the 30th, expelling eighteen Communist students from the school whom the Garrison Department had decided to arrest, and at the same time declared that he had submitted his resignation.

<h3>Land and Others, Who Investigated Japanese War Crimes, Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Military Tribunal Judge Lu Qi and Clerk Wang Shuliang went to Hangzhou to investigate the crimes of Japanese war criminals Zhibara Heizo, former head of the Hangzhou Special Service Agency, Minamihyaku Koji, former commander of the Hangzhou Military Police, and Sogawa Jiro, former commander of the Sixth Army who invaded Hangzhou. They returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing their official duties. It is said that there were absolutely no people from the Hangzhou area and eastern Zhejiang who came to report the crimes of these criminals. However, during this trip, the Hangzhou Higher Court questioned Li Baohe, Feng Tianbao, Jin Dechun, and the other three of the Four King Kongs, notorious Chinese traitors in Hangzhou, and obtained much corroborating evidence of Zhibara Heizo's crimes. According to Li and others, it is true that Zhibara Heizo raped women from good families. Moreover, he protected opium and gambling dens and was a typical Japanese rogue. The people of Hangzhou feared him like a devil, and they did not even dare to look him in the face when they met him on the street, otherwise they would be severely beaten. Also, No. 6 Hubin Road was originally the secret lair of this devil. Judge Lu and others went to investigate the site in person, but because time had passed, they were unable to obtain evidence.</p>

<h3>Council Approves Urban Planning Outline; Utilizing Existing Docks, Six Ports Are Planned; Pudong Is Designated as a Light Industrial Zone; The Assembly Will Hold Its Third Meeting This Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] Yesterday was the fifth day of the City Council's general assembly.

<p>The Urban Planning Review Committee is organized by twenty-nine councilors, presided over by Deputy Speaker Xu. Director Zhao of the Public Works Bureau reported on the content of the plan, stating that this draft plan took a year and a half to complete. Urban planning work is very important, but it is difficult to please everyone. Zhao also reported that the Executive Yuan had previously issued two orders: one ordering all counties and cities to have urban plans, and one stating that construction funds would be suspended for all those without urban plans.</p>
<p>A Large Airfield to Be Developed Into an International Airport</p>
<p>As a result of the committee's discussions, the overall layout of the Greater Shanghai Urban Plan was largely approved in accordance with the original outline: (1) Regarding ports, it was agreed that the ports should be concentrated at several points in an appropriate manner (excavated or parallel) and, in the near future, the existing docks along the Huangpu River should be used as much as possible. The plan proposes to open six ports, such as designating the Qiujiang dock as an industrial port, the area near Guosong as a fishing port, and the Gaoqiao area as an oil port. (2) Regarding airports, Dachang will be developed into an international airport, and it is planned to build a seaplane base nearby, with the location still preferably on the south bank of the Yangtze River in the northwest of Baoshan.</p>
<p>Restoring the South Station and Expanding the North Station</p>
<p>(3) Regarding railway stations, the review committee amended it as follows: (1) Restore the South Station, (2) Expand the North Station and West Station, and expand the North Station and Maigen Road Station into freight stations. (4) Regarding roads, elevated or double-use excavated roads should be used for direct trunk lines, but this should be decided after further consideration of technical aspects and the situation in this city. (5) Regarding the development of Pudong, it is planned to designate the Pudong area as a light industrial zone, but it should be based on its nature, using those that do not require railway transportation, and several docks should be set up at the ports of the navigable inland rivers to facilitate the development of the industry. (6) Regarding industrial zones, the "Shanghai Municipality Interim Regulations on the Location of Factories" that have been duly decided by the City Council should be reviewed in accordance with the two drafts of the urban plan to make them compatible.</p>

(3) The problem of abandoned babies should be given special attention by the police and social affairs bureaus. (4) Police training should be strengthened to improve attitudes. Traffic police should especially have common sense, be familiar with street names, and understand dialects. At the same time, rickshaw pullers should not be treated harshly, and detention of car cushions should be avoided.</p>
<p>Water Transportation Must Be Improved</p>
<p>(5) The police's handling of public disputes should also be specially improved. (6) Regarding public works, the road repair time is too long, which hinders transportation, and should be improved. (7) The construction of shantytowns is related to transportation, safety, and hygiene, and must be paid attention to.

<h3>The Committee to Guide Student Unrest Modifies the Message to Students</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The Special Committee for Guiding Student Unrest of the City Council continued its meeting yesterday afternoon, still chaired by Wang Zhengting.

<h3>Representatives from Two Universities Petition the Council</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The representatives from Jiaotong University who went to the Council to petition yesterday were Chui Weicheng, Dean of the Management College, Zhong Zhaolin, Chairman of the Electrical Engineering Department, Professor Chai Zhiming, and students Wang Zhisui, Feng Wen, and Zhang Qishu. After being received by Wang Zhengting and Wang Zhuyi, the three students withdrew first, while Zhong Weicheng stated the course of events on the seat of the Committee to Guide Student Unrest, which was quite impassioned. Finally, he said: "People suspect that I am inciting the strike, and I also suspect that people are inciting the strike. We can find them to confront each other." Zhu Shanyuan, Tian Zhenbang, Zhu Xiangxian, and Hua Yongshen, four student representatives from Datong University, also went to the City Council to petition yesterday afternoon and were received by Tao Baichuan. According to the representatives, the strike at Datong this time was purely an internal incident to reform the school's faculty, but unfortunately, it caused the arrest of students. There are currently eleven students who have been arrested. Except for one person who has been released, the rest are still in custody. Among them, student Hu Ningsheng suffers from tuberculosis and urgently needs treatment. Therefore, they request two points: (1) Immediately release the arrested students, and (2) Urge Acting President Hu to come forward to negotiate. Counselor Tao agreed to transfer the opinions to the committee and discuss the solution with the Mayor.</p>
<h3>The Results of the Joint Review by the Two Committees of the Council; The Stock Exchange Can Be Temporarily Retained; Seven Opinions on Preventing Abuse</h3>
<p>[Our Own Correspondent] The proposal submitted by City Councilor Chen Gongda and jointly signed by seventy-two city councilors: "Requesting the Central Government to abolish all stock exchanges in Shanghai, eliminate speculation, stabilize the people's livelihood, and maintain law and order" was submitted to the joint review meeting of the Finance and Social Affairs Committees of the City Council yesterday morning for review. More than thirty councilors from the two committees attended, with Chairman Wang Yansong presiding. Wang Zhixin, General Manager of the Stock Exchange, was unable to attend due to circumstances, and was represented by Yang Yinpu and Gu Shanchang, assistant managers of the Stock Exchange and Hua Wenyu, chief secretary of the Stock Exchange. Councilor Wang Weiyin reported in his review opinion that the Stock Exchange's own organization has a legal basis, and it does not seem to be easily abolished. However, he believed that the delivery trade needed improvement. Gu Shanchang stood up to explain that the delivery trade of securities has made a slight contribution to absorbing floating funds; from the study of facts and theory, it is believed that the stock market has no ability to lead prices.</p>
<h3>Cannot Be Considered A Wen</h3>
<p>During the discussion, the representatives of the Stock Exchange were first asked to leave. The councilors then expressed their opinions one after another. Finally, the review result was passed that "In order to assist the circulation of stocks, make it easier to raise funds needed for industry, and to attract a portion of floating funds into the right track so as not to be used for hoarding and speculation, the establishment of a Stock Exchange is naturally indispensable. All advanced countries in Europe and the United States have stock exchanges in all major cities. The existence of stock exchanges in our country has not started today. Before the Anti-Japanese War in this city, in addition to the Stock Exchange, there were also exchanges for cotton cloth, grains, gold, etc., all of which were closed due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, only the Stock Exchange has resumed operations. Other transactions have not yet resumed establishment. This Stock Exchange was approved by the government last year to reorganize and resume business. All legal systems and regulations have been carefully revised and are stationed by supervisory personnel from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The organization system can be called perfect. Its facilities and effectiveness should be more advanced than before the war. If it can abide by the rules and regulations and engage in business, it cannot be regarded as a superfluous tumor, or abandon eating because of choking, so the reviewers believe that the question of whether or not to abolish it can be temporarily retained, but the various points cited by the proposers as concerns are indeed important. In order to prevent problems before they arise and to stop abuses, the following points should be presented to the government to order the Stock Exchange to pay serious attention and supervise them at any time:</p>
<p>(1) The qualifications of listed industrial and commercial stocks should be strictly reviewed, and inferior ones should not be allowed to be mixed in. (2) The types and numbers of listed stocks should be widespread. For example, stocks in the textile, pharmaceutical, rubber, hardware, printing, construction, mining, and shipping industries should be included.

<h3>Re-examination of Li Ze: Over a Hundred New New Company Employees Carry Banners and Flyers to Observe the Hearing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The case of New New Company General Manager Li Ze being accused of being a suspected traitor has been delayed until now, exceeding one and a half years. On August 6th of last year, the High Court sentenced him to three years in prison. The Supreme Court remanded the case for a new trial. The hearing was held at the High Court at 2:30 PM yesterday, being the third hearing after the re-examination. Approximately one hundred employees of the New New Company traveled to observe the hearing in two trucks, carrying huge banners and flyers titled "Expose Li Ze." After Judge Ding Su Hongsheng took his seat, a bailiff brought Li Ze to the court. Li wore a beige paletot, tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, and yellow leather shoes, with a ruddy complexion. The court investigation yesterday focused on three points: (1) The New New Company's hiring of Japanese individuals Ito Masuzo and Kinoshita Yutaka as consultants; (2) His role as a director and preparatory committee member of the puppet Commercial Control Association; and (3) Supplying steel pipes to benefit the enemy. Li testified: (1) The New New Company's hiring of Japanese individuals as consultants was approved by the board of directors. The chairman, Jin Zongcheng, had already testified to this, stating that it was to deal with disturbances caused by Japanese ruffians. Ito Masuzo was the owner of Ekiji Foreign Firm and had never served as a consultant for the New New Company. Kinoshita Yutaka was a consultant. (2) His role as a preparatory committee member of the puppet Commercial Control Association was assigned by the puppet government. It was true that he served as a director, but he did not perform any actual work. He had been approved by the Military Statistics Bureau to participate in order to cover up underground work. (3) There were over 300 steel pipes in total. In September of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), approximately 190 of them were sold to the Mori Dai Iron Factory and not secretly given to the enemy. Subsequently, the accusers Han Wucheng, Yao Zhuoren, and Shu Yueqiao were summoned to refute Li Ze's testimony, stating that Li Ze initiated the organization of the puppet National Commercial Control Association and served as a director for two consecutive terms, participating in many important resolutions. He also secretly gave the enemy approximately 20,000 catties of hot water pipes from the New New Company. Li first served as the first Lianbao Chief of the Lao Zha District in the puppet Shanghai, and then as the Chief Lianbao Chief of the first district. Entrusted by the enemy army, he opened the military-managed Yongfu Real Estate Company, forcibly seizing real estate. Later, he flattered the enemy and puppets, sending senior officials Fang Xueguo, Liang Gongchen, and Chen Bosong to the puppet Manchukuo to celebrate its 10th anniversary. He hired the Japanese retired soldier Kinoshita Yutaka as a consultant, establishing close ties with the enemy and puppets. At this point, Yang Shenjian, the accountant of the New New Company, was summoned to be questioned about the accounts of selling iron to the Mori Dai Iron Factory. Yang stated: The iron was sold to the Mori Dai Iron Factory on September 15th of the 33rd year of the Republic (1944), receiving puppet currency 2,070,348 yuan, paid in three installments. The consultant fee for the Japanese Kinoshita Yutaka was 500 military scrip per month. At this point in the court hearing, it was announced that the case would be adjourned for further investigation. The defendant was returned to custody, and the witnesses were dismissed.</p>

I had no personal relationship with Li Shiqun. I knew him because I treated his illness. The reason for taking the position of president of the puppet hospital was due to (1) Li using my status in the Shanghai medical community, while I took the position because the hospital was a charitable institution; (2) Because I had a relationship with the Military Statistics Bureau, I took the position to cover up my work. The Shanghai Office of the Military Statistics Bureau can prove this.

<h3>Jiaotong University Dean of Studies, Li Ximou, Beaten Up by Students Yesterday, Requesting President Wu to Severely Punish the Leading Students</h3>

The students who caused the trouble this time were only a minority. Afterwards, Li wrote to the school's President Wu Baofeng, requesting that the leading students be severely punished. The original letter is as follows: "Today (30th) when I was leaving the school at noon, I was surrounded by hundreds of students, who verbally abused me, and threw bricks and stones. Then they used their fists and feet, and my head and waist were injured. Under your leadership, brother, I have worked hard on school affairs for several years, and I am deeply saddened to receive such an insult. I think that my personal advancement and retreat are insignificant, but it is extremely heartbreaking that our school's fifty-year-old simple and honest school spirit has been abandoned once. Today, a small number of students despise the rules, disrespect teachers, and act like thugs. If this situation is not investigated in detail and punished severely, then this trend will continue, and the future of the school is unimaginable. I request that you quickly investigate the names of the leading students who caused the trouble, expel them from school, so as to save the declining situation and restore school discipline."</p>

<h3>Fuel Management Committee Convenes Emergency Meeting to Discuss Coal Supply Issues; Encourage Mining and Transportation Within the Scope of Control</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] The Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs convened a temporary emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, given that the coal supply from Qinhuangdao has been disrupted, and no coal shipments have arrived from the 19th of this month until yesterday, leaving only over 50,000 tons of coal in storage at the end of last month. Coal reserves are expected to be only over 40,000 tons by the end of this month, with supplies running dry. In order to prevent such an eventuality, relevant parties were invited to attend the meeting. More than 20 representatives from Qishuyan Power Plant, Junpu Bureau, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Shanghai Port Command, Jinghu Railway Bureau, Textile Construction Company, Industrial Association, Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, Municipal Public Works Bureau, Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, Shipping Guild, Hangzhou Power Plant, and other organizations attended, and the meeting was presided over by Xu Letian, chairman of the Fuel Management Committee. The chairman first reported that he felt deeply about the deteriorating coal supply situation in Qinhuangdao when he returned to Shanghai from Beijing last week, which made him doubt the reliability of future coal supplies. Fortunately, news has recently arrived that the production of Kailuan Coal Mine and the repair of railways have both improved. The National Army is also paying close attention to the security of the area. Therefore, the daily supply can still be maintained at 3,000 tons, and 90,000 tons can be supplied per month. In addition, Huludao supplies 20,000 tons per month, and Huainan and Taiwan coal mines each supply 50,000 tons per month, so the total supply volume for all regions in June can still maintain 210,000 tons, barely meeting the needs of this region and other ports next month. However, coal-consuming agencies are still requested to find ways to plan ahead so that they can maintain themselves in case of any problems with the coal supply. This committee hopes that the supply of coal can be increased. At present, the output of Huainan Coal Mine has reached 70,000 tons per month. If the government can provide financial assistance, it is expected that the monthly output can reach 90,000 tons by the end of the year. Taiwan also has increased production and is expected to supply 50,000 tons per month. As for commercial transportation, recently, at the request of merchants and civilians, except for the controlled Northeast, Kaijie, Huainan, Zhongxing, Huadong, and Taiwan mines, small mines in Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other places are encouraged to mine and transport coal as much as possible under the condition that it does not conflict with the local control scope. The one-time mining and transportation volume shall not exceed 100 tons for coal merchants and shall not exceed one month's demand for manufacturers. At the same time, this committee has discussed with the Central Bank to try to relax the quota as much as possible for coal merchants who have their own foreign exchange and are willing to transport coal from abroad to China, which is also expected to be realized. As for the adjustment of coal prices, it is currently awaiting discussion and approval by the National Price Commission today (31st) in order to increase the supply of various mines. Finally, representatives expressed their opinions, and the meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>In addition, the committee's allocation of monthly coal tonnage to this region and other ports is as follows: public utilities 40,000 tons, railways 24,000 tons, ships 20,000 tons, power plants in other ports (along the Jinghu-Hangzhou line) 14,000 tons, government agencies 6,000 tons, military, Allied, and charitable organizations 3,000 tons, factories 30,000 tons, Qingdao 20,000 tons, Lianyungang 2,000 tons, Hankou 7,000 tons, other ports (Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou) 10,000 tons, totaling 176,000 tons, plus 40,000 tons for Nanjing, totaling 216,000 tons.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the factory-level warp market showed no signs of weakening.

Another batch of Blue Double Tiger was offered at 23 loads, priced at 24.5 million yuan. Separate batches of dried warp were also traded at 18 million yuan, an increase of 1 million yuan compared to the previous day. New high prices continued to emerge, leaving buyers helpless.

<p>(1) Cocoon prices will remain unchanged as originally set, but will be appropriately increased based on the quality of the cocoons.</p>
<p>(2) In addition to the loans approved by the Four Joint Banks, an additional 100 billion should be requested. The loans must be allocated to cocoon collection locations before the peak season for silkworm cocoons.</p>
<p>(3) Budget Estimates: Regular and temporary expense budgets will be reviewed by representatives from the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry, the Central Bank, the Central Agricultural Bank, the China Silk Corporation, and this committee. The results will be submitted at the next meeting and then reported to the relevant departments.</p>
<p>(4) Measures to suppress cocoon prices were amended and passed.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] As of yesterday, 65 cocoon collection companies have opened accounts with the China Farmers Bank to process spring cocoon loans. The bank has already remitted 140.4 billion yuan in cocoon collection loans to various locations.</p>
<h3>Transportation Management Committee Stipulates Import Goods Allocation Methods</h3>
<p>The quotas for the second quarter imports have been announced by the Transportation Management Committee. However, recently, there has been intense dispute between importers and industry regarding the allocation of various goods. The Transportation Management Committee has now stipulated that for simple import goods, such as cotton, wool, and newsprint, with few categories and relatively fixed users, the allocation will be handled by the respective industrial associations to their members. However, after the respective industrial associations request and obtain approval, they must have the goods imported by importers and are not allowed to import themselves. For complex import goods, such as chemical raw materials and machinery parts, with numerous categories and users, and without a centralized management industrial association, they will be allocated by the import industry. To avoid importers illegally selling import quotas privately, importers must present and verify sales contracts before being allowed to import. In addition, there are three points of contention that the committee has clarified: (1) some factories that applied to register as importers and were not qualified want to avoid paying commissions to importers but seek to obtain allocation rights by importing themselves; (2) some factories need larger quantities and must consolidate the import quotas of several importers to meet their needs and want to find ways to obtain allocation rights by importing themselves; (3) some factories need raw materials that commercial importers are unwilling to import, and they also want to be able to import themselves. The committee has focused on these three issues and will carefully consider them and gradually improve the situation.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>New Discussion on the Deeds of Shi Nai'an</h3>
<p>— Yu Heng</p>
<p>My hometown, Baiju Town, is located on the Fan Gong Dike and is also known as Old Market. The name comes from the meaning of the "Book of Songs": "Bright and white colt, eats my market." This small place was once the birthplace of the national revolutionary hero Zhang Shicheng and also the burial place of Shi Nai'an, the author of *Water Margin*.</p>
<p>The issue of Shi Nai'an's original home has been a long-standing and contentious debate. According to the author's preface in *Water Margin*, he is from Dongdu (Luoyang?), but some say his original home was Huai'an, others say it was Qiantang, and still others say Shi Nai'an was a pseudonym for Luo Guanzhong. However, people with the surname Shi in our hometown and the Xinghua County Chronicle say he was from Baiju, Xinghua. Due to the lack of textual research, everyone is merely making inferences based on their own ideas, which only makes the matter more confusing.</p>
<p>Last autumn, the *Shen Bao*’s *Chunqiu Huikan* published two articles about Shi Nai'an, which had insightful views, but unfortunately, they were not detailed enough. Now, Dr. Shi Fusheng from my hometown has copied and sent excerpts from the "Epitaph of Shi Nai'an" by Wang Daosheng of Huai'an (with slight differences from the Xinghua County Chronicle) and the fragments of "A Short History of Shi Nai'an's Life" compiled by Yuan Jiren from the Shi clan genealogy. I will first transcribe them as they are for the reference of wise and knowledgeable people:</p>
<p>Epitaph: The public's given name was Zi'an, courtesy name Nai'an (the Xinghua County Chronicle says the given name was Er, courtesy name Zi'an). He was awarded the Jinshi degree in the late Yuan Dynasty and served as an official in Qiantang for two years. Because he did not agree with the powerful and influential people of the time, he abandoned his official position and returned to his hometown, where he closed his door and devoted himself to writing, recalling old events, and ultimately died in bitterness. Although I do not know the details of the public's deeds, I can still recount them. Although I did not personally see the public's face, I can only imagine his appearance. The public died at the age of seventy-five, and I was still a child. When I grew up, I met his disciple Luo Guanzhong in Fujian, and we stayed in the same inn. At night, we lit candles and talked about the anecdotes of the master, which were so moving that we could not help but sigh together. The master's works include *Zhiyu, Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, *Chronicles of the Sui and Tang Dynasties*, *The Story of San Sui Subduing the Demons*, and *Tales of Heroes of the Rivers and Lakes*, which is *Water Margin*. Every time a draft was completed, he would revise it with his disciple Luo Guanzhong, and Luo contributed greatly. Alas, heroes are born in times of chaos, so even if they have a clear and harmonious understanding, they still have to end their lives with unrealized ambitions. This is what makes the hermits and recluses of all ages weep bitterly. When the master's home was in Huai'an, it was only a wall away from mine. Unfortunately, I was born too late and did not receive his personal instruction, which I always regret. Last year, his descendant, Mr. Shuyuan, moved his coffin south and lingered with me again and again, asking about his family history, but he refused to reveal it. When asked about his aspirations, he sighed and lamented. What he said about his ancestor and Luo Guanzhong was roughly the same. Alas! When the country is in turmoil, men of ambition cannot realize their potential and are treated like hawks and dogs, so they will retreat from the world and gain fame. (There should be some missing words here.) Moreover, in a world where chaos reigns and villains are in power, the master's life can be said to be unfortunate. However, although the master suffered hardship and adversity, he refused to bow down and seek recommendation. He closed his door and wrote books to (missing word) the master's determination can be (missing word) pure... (the rest is incomplete)</p>
<p>Short History... Nai'an and Shicheng's (missing word) general Bian Yuanheng were friendly. Shicheng prepared armor and weapons, spying on the Yuan court. He regarded Bian Yuanheng as Guangfeng. Hearing of Nai'an's fame, he sent invitations, but Nai'an did not respond. Shicheng visited his door and saw Nai'an writing *Tales of Heroes of the Rivers and Lakes*, which is *Water Margin*. Shicheng smiled and said, "Sir, you do not want to achieve success in this era but instead use your pen to express yourself. Isn't this wasting your time?" Nai'an heard this and put down his pen, kowtowing and saying, "I have no other talent. I only rely on my soft pen as a confidant, wielding my unrestrained spirit. The world looks up to me with admiration. If you do not despise (missing word) and condescend to visit, I would be truly guilty! How dare a man of ambition refuse to serve? However, my family has many troubles. My mother is old, my wife is weak, my children are getting married, and I am burdened with debts. If I leave, my mother will lose her support. General, your benevolence is like rain, showering everywhere. You must pity me and allow me to fulfill my filial piety, so I will be forever grateful." After he said this, he prostrated himself on the ground and refused to rise. Shicheng was displeased and left in a huff. At that time, *Tales of Heroes of the Rivers and Lakes* was at the forty-fifth chapter... These two fragmentary texts are said to have been around for quite some time. Unfortunately, there are no detailed dates to examine, but according to my speculation, they must be true records. People with deceitful intentions would never be so honest. Based on the five clues within, we can deduce the following:</p>
<p>Epitaph: Served as an official in Qiantang for two years...</p>
<p>Short History: Nai'an was friendly with Bian Yuanheng, a general under Shicheng. Shicheng was displeased and left in a huff.</p>
<p>Epitaph: When the master's home was in Huai'an, his descendant, Mr. Shuyuan, moved his coffin south... Refused to reveal.</p>
<p>These clues lead to a novel discovery, which, although not proven, is at least a very reasonable hypothesis: Shi Nai'an once lived in seclusion in Baiju, probably in the years after serving as an official in Qiantang for two years. At that time, the Yuan court was losing its power, and the world was in chaos. A person like him would never be willing to settle in the chaotic political arena. Therefore, he abandoned his official position, initially intending to return to his hometown in the north, but at that time, there were iron horses, golden spears, and smoke filled the sky. It would be very difficult for a poor official with clean sleeves (Shi Nai'an probably did not exploit the people, otherwise the heroes in his writings would not be so opposed to corrupt officials) to bring his family from Qiantang to Luoyang (assuming his hometown was Luoyang). Would he stay in Zhejiang and be captured by Fang Guozhen? Naturally, he could not do that either. At this time, being in a dangerous area, he was in a dilemma and could only choose a relatively close and safe place to go. Looking at the many rebel kings at this time, Zhang Shicheng of Baiju was the most capable of respecting virtue and treating scholars with courtesy (the Biography of Zhang Shicheng in the *History of the Ming Dynasty* has a similar comment). Nai'an was friendly with Bian Yuanheng, a general under Shicheng, and he was also a writer with radical revolutionary ideas. Of course, he might have come to Baiju with a new hope, wanting to cooperate with Zhang Shicheng in some great cause. Therefore, he moved his family to Baiju. Later, he saw through Shicheng's actions and determined that he would not succeed. He simply lived in seclusion and expressed his thoughts in writing, depicting the heroic figures he imagined one by one, contrasting them with the dark reality of the politics at that time, and using the story of Song Jiang at the end of the Song Dynasty to express his pent-up frustration. When Shicheng personally came to invite him to serve, because he already had preconceived notions, he angered Shicheng instead. It was naturally not appropriate to stay in Baiju for long, so he fled alone to Huai'an. This may have been the only way to go to Luoyang, but eventually, due to obstacles on the road, he had to reside in Huai'an. At the same time, it is even more possible that his works aroused the antipathy of the officials. To avoid literary persecution, he could not come forward (the "refusal to reveal" mentioned in the epitaph may refer to this). Until later, he was staying in Huai'an. Later, his children and grandchildren who stayed in Baiju returned his coffin and buried it in the Shi family grave that is now spoken of. One branch of his bloodline has forever become native to Baiju.</p>
<p>Now, what remains for people to mourn is only a desolate tomb next to the Shi Family Bridge near Daying, seventeen miles west of Baiju. According to the Shi clan genealogy, their seventeenth ancestor, Duke Shuyuan (Nai'an's grandson), once stationed troops here. The names Daying (big camp) and Xiaoying (small camp) originated at this time. There are tens of thousands of acres of military-cultivated land nearby, which are still called Tunjun Township.</p>
<p>In the summer of the 29th year of the Republic of China, the Jiangsu Provincial Government moved north, and the Civil Affairs and Education Departments temporarily resided in Baiju for half a year. Wang Gongyu, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Jin Zonghua, the Director of the Education Department, were both interested in excavating this major literary history mystery and planned to investigate Nai'an's tomb. Unfortunately, just when the plans were being vigorously pursued, the situation changed again, and the provincial government moved west to Xinghua. After the two officials left, this matter was slowly forgotten by everyone in the difficult years. 36, 3.21.</p>
<h3>Old Home</h3>
<p>— Qinling</p>
<p>Occasionally returning home, I chatted with my mother. She told me sadly that the painted pavilion in the back enclosure had collapsed in a night of wind and rain. - The forgotten pavilions and figures of the old home flashed before my eyes again.</p>
<p>When my grandfather was alive, this painted pavilion was where he rested in his later years. My grandfather studied and became an official, then became a merchant, and then retired to study again. The life of hard work in his early years created a quiet and peaceful character in his later years. He personally designed every plant and tree in the garden. The flowerbeds and trees were distributed appropriately. I especially loved the parasol tree in front of the painted pavilion. In the summer, its branches and leaves swayed, shading the room with green. My grandfather named his study "Silk Fills the Window," which was very fitting. I also remember that the couplet used the lines "Citrus and beans, fresh fruits and vegetables, bamboo cane and straw shoes, old cloth clothes." When I was young, leaning on my grandfather's lap, he taught me to recognize these words day by day. My grandfather liked calligraphy and practiced writing every morning. A young servant specially assigned to him had to grind a tile bowl of ink every night. My grandfather was quite strict about the choice of writing materials. The ink should not be ground too quickly to avoid roughness, and the ink should be left for a certain period of time before it could be used. When that servant was nodding off next to the kerosene lamp, grinding ink, we would always tease him, making him neither fast nor slow, smearing ink all over his face and hands. Unfortunately, my grandfather had too many types of calligraphy models, so he could not specialize and excel. His writing was neither Ou nor Su; neither Zhao nor Wang, so he did not dare to write couplets for others.</p>
<p>My grandfather had a serious and meticulous personality. As soon as you heard his cough, the family members would become as quiet as cicadas in winter. But I was an exception. I often climbed on a small stool to accompany him to write, answering some bold questions. He would always stroke my braid and smile, saying, "This girl is really naughty!" My grandmother also loved books very much. Once she had a book in her hand, she would not ask or hear about anything else. When I was young, the Thousand Character Classic and Tang poetry that I sang were learned from my grandmother. The old nanny (the nanny of my sixth uncle) often said, "The lady's good character is really rare. As long as she is holding a book, she doesn't care if the children break their heads." Indeed, my grandmother didn't like to worry about household chores and left everything to the old nanny. The nanny was truly a hero in our family. My eldest uncle, father, and youngest uncle were all raised by her. However, my grandmother had unique skills in cooking, and my grandfather often took pride in her achievements when he hosted banquets. Only a small part of their specialties remains for us now.</p>
<p>The old nanny was a good companion in our childhood. When my grandfather and father went out at night, we accompanied her to wait for the door. In the dim light, she hugged us and told us about the Classic of Mountains and Seas, singing nursery rhymes in a high-pitched voice. We cousins were all her darlings. We looked for her to solve any difficult problems, asked her to plead with our mothers when we did something wrong, and asked her to judge when the siblings quarreled. Every time she came back from the street, each "darling" (her name for us) had some snacks to eat, so the old nanny was the children's god at that time.</p>
<p>In addition, the gardener Lao Qiao was also a key figure in the old home. My grandfather loved to eat fresh vegetables. A corner of the garden was designated as a vegetable plot. Lao Qiao could recognize my grandfather's preferences and arranged the seasonal vegetables appropriately. At the same time, he could also prune flower branches and knew some planting techniques. Undoubtedly, he and the old nanny formed a unique position among the servants. Lao Qiao regarded the flowers and trees as important as my grandfather. Whoever picked the fruit would be scolded. I remember that once the driver stole a few branches of cherries, Lao Qiao grumbled for a long time. But the next day, half of that cherry tree was chopped down, and Lao Qiao was so angry that he didn't even eat. But when he was drinking, his temper was unexpectedly gentle. After a day's work, a brightly polished kerosene lamp, half a bottle of liquor, and twenty copper coins for sauced meat were his little world. When he had a few drinks, he would tell a series of past events. His wife who eloped, his son who died at the age of sixteen, his three years of military service, the gunshot wound on his arm... Finally, he opened his red eyes and sighed, "I've been through everything."</p>
<p>Among the people above, only Lao Qiao is still alive. Although he is more than sixty years old, his hair is still black, but his back is bent. Closing my eyes, I clearly remember my grandfather's chubby, long face with a few strands of beard, my grandmother's gentle and kind smile, and the old nanny's wrinkled face. But I can't grasp them. They are so far away from me, so far away... Like a kite with a broken string.</p>
<p>In the past twenty years, the old home has undergone too many changes. After the death of my grandparents, the garden gradually became desolate. Because the descendants didn't need them, the paint on the painted pavilion was peeling off, and the window lattices were skewed out of shape. Occasionally running inside, the dust-covered book boxes and the water-stained drafts of my grandfather's writings filled my heart with inexplicable melancholy. The parasol tree in front of the window was riddled with ant damage, and an air-raid shelter was built in the center of the garden. Everything has changed. The prosperity of the garden in the past, along with my grandfather's cough and my childhood, was deeply buried. I am not obsessed with the bones of the old home. I know that all good things will pass and disappear. But when I think of the peaceful atmosphere of my grandfather drinking and reciting poetry at that time, that kind of leisurely and peaceful mood, I can't stop my sadness.</p>
<h3>Revisit to West Lake</h3>
<p>— Ma Gongyu</p>
<p>Spring news speaks only of war, yet I come to West Lake to hear singing; twenty years have passed, the scene has changed, ten miles of open space, I let my shoulders jostle with the crowd, dreams of the temple are gone, leaving a sense of loss, the ritual at Longhong has ended, leaving much emotion (with the Spring Festival at Xiling Seal Society); happy that old friends are still abundant, we sat among the thorns for seven days, faces flushed with wine.</p>
<h3>Pine</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding</p>
<h3>Family Letter</h3>
<p>— Hui Zhi</p>
<p>In the dead of winter, when cold rain tapped at the window and snowflakes fluttered, you secretly left the isolated island in that silver world, enduring bitterness and saying goodbye to your loving mother and me. At that time, although you tried your best to use reason to restrain the melancholy in your heart, how could you have known that the grief of your mother and me was even greater than your own feelings as a wandering son?</p>
<p>In the past, you often told me to "be independent," unwilling to be intoxicated in an ivory tower. You wanted to escape this atmosphere surrounded by low pressure, pursue the highest ideals of young people. I knew that in your heart, that long-stirred emotion had broken through the dike solidified in your heart. This city, this isolated island, this magic city, you had nothing to linger over.</p>
<p>However, in these days, do you know what kind of life your mother and I have been living, and how anxious we are for you to go to a distant and unfamiliar land with no relatives, and how worried we are about your wandering life of climbing mountains and wading through water? Fortunately, after a year, we received your letter from Jincheng, knowing that you had traveled eight thousand miles from Jinhua via Shangrao to Chengdu. The old man and I finally calmed down. However, for a long time, we did not receive any news from you again.</p>
<p>Time passed like a shooting star. When the banner of victory was fluttering on the city walls of the recovered areas, how excited I was! Mother also happily showed a smile that she had not had in the past few years, saying, "This is truly a blessing given to us by God. Your brother can come back soon, and we will reunite to have a good time." After hearing this, I was so happy that I didn't even want to eat, quietly waiting for your return, bringing happiness to our whole family. However, we didn't even have any news from you.</p>
<p>It wasn't until last spring that the green messenger delivered a double-registered letter from Washington. When I received that unusually unfamiliar and heavy letter, I was very surprised. Looking closely, I realized it was your letter. The emotions revealed in your scribbled handwriting gave my mother and me infinite comfort. Unexpectedly, you had joined the air force and even traveled across the ocean to the United States to study. This was truly beyond our expectations.</p>
<p>Batch after batch of air force soldiers have returned home. I think your return is not far away. I hope that you will drive a B29 Superfortress, cross the Pacific Ocean, and safely fly back to the skies of your motherland, returning to the home you haven't seen for six years. Your relatives and friends here are waiting for you.</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountains and Rivers, One Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Of course, it's good to be on the same path, we can take care of each other - let's do this, we'll advance gradually using a 20-yard increment method; try to avoid the enemy as much as possible, and the best strategy is not to take action; the purpose is only to respond - if we already have someone inside - if there's time to come out, of course we can lead the large team and advance smoothly; if there's not enough time or it's too difficult, we'll provide internal support from inside..." Shouyi determined this method and said to the short man, "Please pay attention, the large team may arrive soon; once they arrive, please ask them to encircle and attack on three sides according to the original plan!"</p>
<p>Why does this original plan only encircle on three sides? What is the intention of leaving that fourth side open? It turns out this is an extremely refined method of using troops; encircling on all four sides will create a "cornered beast" mentality in the enemy; "cornered beasts" may disregard everything and desperately try to break out a bloody path. Moreover, on Hejian Shouyi's side, there is still the weakness of being afraid to harm the valuable object, lest they accidentally kill Pingzi, which would be a waste of effort.</p>
<p>Unbelievably, just when Shouyi Hejian and the short man had finished their discussion and were about to take action, they suddenly heard gunfire coming from the bandit den in the distance, followed by a siren sounding like a ghost's wail, making a chaotic noise. There were actually two searchlights on the roof, emitting two dazzling beams of light, turning around to search in all directions.</p>
<p>"This is a lawless act! What gives these things the right to act so recklessly in someone else's country?" Seeing how rampant the Japanese could be in Shanghai, which had not fallen, Hejian felt strange.</p>
<p>"Quick... follow me!" Shouyi leaped out of the car and shouted in a low voice to Hejian.</p>
<p>Why was Shouyi so anxious? In his imagination, he believed that the four naughty young ladies of Bai Ren Zhuang, and perhaps others, had already attacked this nest and had been discovered by the enemy, which is why they were making such a fuss. With this commotion, he thought that the group of naughty people might already be surrounded by the enemy. Therefore, he could not help but be anxious. Although Shouyi and Hejian were only two people, they could still provide support; moreover, the abilities of the two were quite strong.</p>
<p>The two men rushed forward for dozens of steps, and in the shadows they saw a figure rushing towards them. The man was running and signaling an alert. Shouyi heard that it was one of his own and gave the signal in response.</p>
<p>"09...?"</p>
<p>"...15!"</p>
<p>After confirming the password, the man immediately stopped and said, "The situation has changed!" with a mix of Chinese and Japanese accent.</p>
<p>"What happened? Tell me quickly!" Shouyi simply spoke in Japanese.</p>
<p>"It sounds like there's infighting inside; the tone of one of the leaders is scolding people, and the sound is very chaotic; I couldn't understand clearly for a moment, and I was afraid of being seen by the lights, so I came to report..."</p>
<p>"Go report it then!" Shouyi shouted at the man, beckoned to Hejian, and ran straight toward the wasteland. Both of these men had won championships in running and walking competitions, so a few dozen yards of road, plus a few dozen yards of wide wasteland, were not worth mentioning. But because they had to avoid the enemy's hidden posts and searchlights! Of course, they couldn't be as fast as lightning like in a race; they could only advance by flashing, dodging, running, and stopping, like playing hide-and-seek. They had originally agreed on a 20-yard increment method, but now, due to the change in the situation, they changed it to a 10-yard, or even a 5-6-yard increment.</p>
<h3>Rambling Alone</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Today, Mr. Ding Tang gave me a piece of calligraphy, which read:</p>
<p>"History says that Du Gongbu died from eating beef. I have tried to investigate the reason, which cannot be separated from two paths: one is that the beef was rotten and poisoned him, and the other is that he was starved for too long and ate too much at once, which he could not digest. I am afraid that the latter is closer to the truth. Gongbu was poor and often starved. Speaking of it, there is still pain."</p>
<p>After reading it, I laughed loudly, and after laughing, I felt great pain. Thinking of myself, those who make a living by writing all suffer the same way.</p>
<p>And the so-called "engineers of human souls" are not as good as the clay sculptures in broken temples that are worshiped by the ignorant people.</p>
<p>What's the reason for the popularity of the land god of wealth over the poems of Du Zimei?</p>
<p>The God of Wealth Bodhisattva enshrined in the temple holds a steel whip in his right hand and rides a fierce tiger under his trousers. I think the original creators must have had other meanings.</p>
<p>The reason why the God of Wealth can be rich is that he has a steel whip and a fierce tiger.</p>
<p>Those who are obsessed with wealth! You don't have to kneel in front of the seat of the God of Wealth. I advise you, if you don't have weapons like atomic bombs or pistols, you should quickly run to the kitchen in the back and quickly grab your kitchen knife. If you don't have a fierce tiger, you can replace it with a fierce dog; otherwise, a fierce man will do.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of a Fallen Woman: On the Box Corpse Case in Anqing</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhou</p>
<p>Recently, Nie Xiequn, a lecturer at Anqing University, murdered his "fallen woman." His behavior was far more sinister than that of "Lin Daojun" in the movie "Return in Glory." Is it that the movie story cannot keep up with reality, or is the sinister nature of reality far beyond the imagination of ordinary intellectuals?</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun once said: "Due to deeper worldly wisdom, I cannot help but think more harshly about certain phenomena, but as a result, the harshness of reality is often greater than my imagination. This is really something that cannot be helped." (Approximate meaning) Please don't think this is a joke. The mediocre masses who take truth as a joke will one day eat the bitter fruit of their foolishness. In Chinese society, it is not easy for someone who is willing to think deeply to laugh a few times easily. A romantic intellectual who indulges in dreams, seeing the cruelty of reality, can only be a pessimist, let alone other realists. Even the realist's pen cannot keep up with the cruelty of reality, and can only cry out helplessly. This on the one hand illustrates the lamentable nature of intellectuals, and on the other hand confirms that China does indeed have its "special national conditions."</p>
<p>This Anqing University lecturer, Nie Xiequn, is a complete intellectual with extremely high cultural cultivation. However, let's see how he treats his "fallen woman"?</p>
<p>"(A news report from Anqing) Nie Xiequn is a lecturer at the Law School of Anqing University and a graduate of Wuhan University. His first wife, Chen Zuoqun, has been married for many years and has a daughter named Juying, who is already fourteen years old. When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, Nie transferred to the rear, and Chen gradually became a "fallen woman." In the thirty-third year, Nie remarried a woman from Hubei named Yu Liufang as an anti-Japanese war wife. After the victory, Yu Liufang discovered that Nie had another wife and complained incessantly. Nie vowed to divorce Chen, otherwise, he would use force. ... Unexpectedly, on the eighteenth, Chen Zuoqun suddenly came with her daughter. That night, Nie had Chen share the same bed with him. In the middle of the night, Nie stuffed Chen's mouth with cotton, called Yu up, and together they strangled Chen's throat with gauze. Chen could not make a sound... After she died, Nie and Yu put the corpse in a canvas box, planning to throw it into the river..."</p>
<p>This is the sensational box corpse case in Anqing. The main culprit was actually a university lecturer. What is strange is that until the day before the crime, he was still teaching "Ethics" and "Introduction to Philosophy" at Anqing University. I don't know if his "Ethics" included the item "How to deal with a fallen woman." If not, it doesn't matter. His "teaching by example" is much stronger than his "teaching by words."</p>
<p>I am thinking that if someone dares to adapt the Anqing box corpse case into a movie, then Zhao Dan's "Return in Glory" will be overshadowed, which can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Miss Jiang Ying's Solo Recital Held Today at the Lyceum Theatre</h3>
<h3>Mr. Wu Zhengqian's Solo Concert</h3>
<p>— Sound Harmony</p>
<p>The renowned tenor Professor Wu Zhengqian will hold a solo concert at the Lyceum Theatre on June 1st. This is an outstanding solo recital following the soprano Jiang Ying's concert. I am happy to provide readers with a brief introduction to several special programs.</p>
<p>The repertoire includes songs from various Chinese and foreign composers, and the "Drinking Song" from Verdi's opera "La Traviata." Among them are Purcell's "I Attempt from Love's Sickness to Fly" from the late 17th century—an excerpt from the incidental music of the drama "The Indian Queen," Schubert's "Erlkönig," Tchaikovsky's "None But the Lonely Heart," and Bizet's "Agnus Dei" from the opera "Carmen," all of which are long-established and popular songs.</p>
<p>Regarding the works of Chinese composers, he has chosen Jiang Dingxian's "National Elegy," He Luting's "On the Jialing River," and Zhao Yuanren's "How Can I Not Think of Her," all of which are well-known pieces familiar to music audiences. I would especially like to introduce and recommend the three folk songs from our country's border regions that Professor Wu will be singing this time:</p>
<p>(1) "In That Faraway Place," a Qinghai folk song, with accompaniment arranged by Chen Tianhe.</p>
<p>(2) "Coachman's Song," a Xinjiang folk song, with accompaniment arranged by Yan Liangkun.</p>
<p>(3) Kangding Love Song, a Xikang folk song, with accompaniment arranged by Jiang Dingxian.</p>
<p>These three folk songs are not only extremely popular tunes in the border regions, but their mood and style are also very special, and they are sure to give listeners a fresh feeling.</p>
<h3>"The Lost Weekend"</h3>
<p>— Man</p>
<p>"The Lost Weekend" was one of the most moving dramas of last year, winning four Academy Awards: Best Actor Ray Milland, Best Director Billy Wilder, Best Screenplay Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, and Best Producer Charles Brackett. This film has now arrived in Shanghai and will be released soon at the Cathay Theatre.</p>
<p>"The Lost Weekend" tells the story of an alcoholic's drinking spree. He repeatedly tries to quit drinking but fails. He even steals things to get alcohol, causing him shame and hatred, and he nearly commits suicide. The performance is exceptionally tense, and Ray Milland's portrayal of inner turmoil is a great achievement.</p>
<h3>Hirohito Takes to the Streets</h3>
<p>— Bao Qing</p>
<p>According to the recent Tokyo Daily News, the Emperor of Japan, after the resolution of the political situation, will tour Kyoto, Osaka, Wakayama, and other places. This descendant of Emperor Jimmu, who in the past "inherited the ancestral legacy and ascended to the throne of an unbroken line for ten thousand generations," and who will henceforth be "the symbol of the State of Japan and of the unity of the Japanese people," knows that in the past "the great power of governing the State was inherited from our ancestors and will be passed on to our descendants," while publicly "his position is based on the will of the Japanese people, who hold sovereign power." He understands the inevitability of the times and the environment. Therefore, on the first New Year's Day after the end of the war, he issued a rescript stating that he was not a god and that the people should not believe in myths. In this way, Hirohito made an unprecedented public statement in Japanese history, beginning to show that he wanted to be close to the people and to grasp the overall will of the nation. The second step was to take to the streets and approach the people.</p>
<p>For example, in mid-February and March of last year: On February 19th, he wore a light suit, sat in a car, and traveled without any guards to Kawasaki, Tsurumi, Yokohama, and other places near Tokyo in Kanagawa Prefecture to inspect the post-war recovery of factories, municipal administration, and residential areas. On March 1st, he went to a place near Tokyo to inspect the lives of war orphans and visited an agricultural association warehouse. Farmers asked the government for rice, and his conversation with the district head, who also served as the head of the agricultural association, was recorded.</p>
<p>Last November, Yang Ge, a reporter from the International News Service, came to Shanghai from Japan and mentioned that when he witnessed Hirohito's tour of Nagoya, the crowd waiting for the Emperor stretched for eighteen miles, including both the old and the young. He also said that 30,000 photos of the Emperor, which had been banned from display, reappeared after the uniforms were changed to civilian clothes.</p>
<p>When the new Japanese constitution was established, Emperor Hirohito and his wife rode in a carriage out of the palace and accepted cheers from the people in front of the palace, but only twenty to thirty thousand people gathered to watch. On the third of this month, when celebrating the implementation of the new constitution, the situation was even more desolate. In the cold wind and drizzle, no more than ten thousand people braved the rain to celebrate in front of the palace. His aides had advised him not to attend due to the bad weather, but he insisted on participating, only appearing in the square for three minutes. On the day before the implementation of the new constitution, he even held an unprecedented press conference, directly answering some unimportant questions from reporters.</p>
<p>The Japanese people under conservative forces always have sharp eyes and know that the wheels of time are moving forward, especially since the Emperor has declared that he is not a god. Therefore, some people believe that if the Emperor is not a god, then it does not matter whether he exists or not; or they say that since it is a democracy, then there is no need for an Emperor! However, the older generation still supports retaining the Emperor, even if it is only as a symbol.</p>
<h3>The White Elephant (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>After that, the calico cat came often, and the white elephant went often, and no one thought it strange. I found the white elephant even more adorable. Because she wasn't like Mr. Lu Xun's cat, who made strange noises on the roof when in love, disturbing his reading and writing, so he used a long bamboo pole to hit her. Later, her belly gradually grew larger. After about two or three months, her belly became especially large, looking just like a white elephant. We took an old box, removed the lid, and used it as her birthing bed. One day, she went into labor and gave birth to five kittens: three pure white and two calico. Everyone congratulated her, and we immediately called the male worker Zhang Hong to go to the Yue Fei Temple to buy fresh fish to nourish her, and the girls gave her Carnation Milk every day.</p>
<p>The kittens grew bigger day by day, and after two weeks, they could crawl. The white elephant was very patient in raising her children, lying down day and night, letting the five kittens entangle her. Her body was huge, and to the five kittens, she was like a hill. They climbed up and down at will, like tourists climbing Lonely Hill on West Lake. It was truly a beautiful sight!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, one day, one of the calico kittens died. My young child, Xin Mei, cried a lot and used a beautiful cigarette box as a coffin, giving her a burial in the grass by West Lake. We cherished the remaining four kittens especially. My family had seven children, three of whom were away, and four in Hangzhou. They divided the four kittens among themselves, each adopting one. The eldest daughter, Chen Bao, adopted the calico cat, while the third daughter, Ning Qing, the youngest daughter, Yi Yin, and the young child, Xin Mei, each adopted a white cat. This was just like the villagers adopting out their children to the bodhisattvas in the temple, hoping for protection, longevity, and wealth. Perhaps because they were not bodhisattvas and could not provide protection, after a while, another white kitten died. There were three kittens left, one calico and two white, and they were all very healthy. They could already eat fish and rice and no longer relied entirely on milk. The white elephant's maternal labor gradually decreased as well. She no longer had to lie down day and night to feed them and could go out for walks at any time or jump onto the girls' laps to sleep. The girls laughed at her, "You're a mother, but you still want to be held?" She ignored them and just went to sleep in your arms.</p>
<h3>The White Elephant and Her Five Kittens</h3>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>His mind was even more chaotic now. Many people used to praise him as being the most resourceful, and although he had not openly admitted it, he had always been proud of it in his heart, because he understood the psychology of all kinds of people and knew what methods to use to deal with them. Moreover, he also had a kind of resilient spirit. Even when things seemed hopeless, he would often deliberately look at them optimistically, continuing to work hard against the odds. This method had indeed helped him solve many difficult problems, but today's problem was simply too difficult. He almost dared not trust himself anymore.</p>
<p>He hung his head, clenched his teeth, and walked forward distractedly. He felt that this road seemed much longer than when he had come, as if he could never finish walking it.</p>
<p>When he returned to the highway checkpoint, the situation there was much more lively than before. Four cars from Yishan were parked there, and the people who got off the cars to rest and the people waiting there to catch a ride were mixed together. Seven or eight people from the theater troupe were also mixed in the crowd.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian wanted to squeeze next to the cars to see what was going on, but his head bumped into Lu Qian.</p>
<p>"It's no use, there's no hope!" He limped forward to greet him. "The roofs of the cars are full of people, no one can get on."</p>
<p>Old Zhu frowned. He could vaguely hear Lu Qian forcefully swallowing a long sigh that was about to be released.</p>
<p>The most active and spirited people in the crowd were four men wearing summer cloth Hawaiian shirts and khaki shorts. They were obviously the drivers of the four cars; everyone followed them, going back and forth in a mess, offering cigarettes, and smiling obsequiously, as if they were serving phoenixes.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian stared at the five white characters "Trade Commission" painted on the four cars and pondered for a long time. Suddenly, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a very old pocket diary, flipping through it hurriedly.</p>
