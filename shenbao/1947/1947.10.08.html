<h3>兩大壁壘政治宣戰　我正注視事態發展　聯合國機構將為犧牲口</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕東歐九國共產黨領袖發表宣言，成立「情報局」消息傳抵此間後，政界人士　表注意。據政府某負責人表示，關於此事，政府方面正注視其發展，並希望多獲得有關此事之情報。外部發言人以未獲足够報導爲理由，拒絕發表任何意見，甚至對蘇聯此種引人注意之新聞發表，是否屬於外交性質一點，亦拒作評論。蘇大使館亦無何消息補充。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕新的共產國際出現後，此間甚表關切。記者今分訪政界人士邵力子，陳立夫，陶希聖等，詢以對此事之個人意見。渠等均就此事作簡略之評述。（意見內容見二版第一欄）</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕據悉：東亞方面之共黨，亦有聯合組織出現，此爲中共·韓共·蒙共合組之東北行政委會。記者曾就此向官方探詢，據稱：政府方面尚未接到有關此事之報告。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖七日電〕兩年前聯合國誕生於熱望之中，今日聯合國垂頭喪氣，而處於美·蘇兩巨人遍於全球之政治戰中。雙方陣營之劃分異常明顯，惟兩方均認法·義爲與國，此兩國爲糾紛之直接賭注，蓋在今後數月中，兩國之共產主義與資本主義將白刃相接。蘇聯之行動（成立新共產國際）將造成兩大效果：　馬歇爾扶助歐洲復興計劃，定將提交國會。　下月在倫敦舉行商討德奧和約之四外長會議勢將失敗，而四强會議之機構，亦可能隨之崩潰。惟聯合國代表一致認爲，最後之犧牲者，乃聯合國本身。（關於美英法反響見第三版）</p>
<h3>蔣主席在平閱兵　勉督察團依法秉公辦案　修路殉難員工予以撫卹</h3>

<p>〔本報北平七日電〕軍吏督察團各委員，由李嗣聰率領，七日下午五時許謁主席報告，主席對該幽工作頗嘉慰，並勉以依法葉公處理案件，貫澈中央澄淸軍紀吏治決心。</p>

<h3>補給命脈摧毀　流匪不難肅淸　石覺謁主席後談話</h3>
<p>〔本報北平七日電〕蔣主席六日晚曾召見熱西綏靖區司令官石覺及卅四集團軍總司令李文。石氏七日談稱：主席曾就目前戰局有所指示，主席稱：今後共匪在關內將不能保持任何重要據點，蓋繼其退出政治中心之陝北，復被逐出其軍事重心之山東。烟台經國軍收復後，其補給命脈沂蒙山區內之兵工廠全被摧毀，故今後共匪只有流竄之一途，而不難期其肅淸。東北戰局有萬全把握，主席甚重視地方軍政配合，並會謂：在此艱苦時期，軍政首長如仍不能密切配合，實屬愚蠢。石氏復就熱省局勢談稱：遼西遭攻擾，實係國軍撤守熱東之後果。國軍克凌源後，即可收復業柏壽，而重打通錦承綫，預料東進國軍不待到遼西，共匪即將先潰退，遼西之廓淸，乃數日內事。</p>

<h3>陶希聖談話　民盟為匪宣傳</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕記者七日晚訪中宣部陶副部長希聖，詢以對董顯光局長關於民主同盟談話之意見。陶氏答稱：「吾人之意見，可以中央日報「民主同盟的自決」社論爲代表，不必贅述。余今另有一事奉告，近來出版業頗見蕭條，但坊間充斥黃色書刊及共黨宣傳書刊，兩者同爲麻醉靑年之毒物。上海新知書店與讀書出版社刊行共匪宣傳書籍尤多」。陶氏續舉事實證明各該書店爲民盟爲匪宣傳之出版機構。（陶氏談話詳見二版第二欄）</p>
<h3>陳明仁謁白部長</h3>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>共產國際的出現</h3>
<p>從歐洲傳來的消息，我們得知共產國際的重又在國際政治舞台上公開出現。對於此一消息的傳來，我們並不感到驚奇。在一九四三年五月，當莫斯科宣布解散共產國際的時候，我們早就感覺到這一向爲莫斯科御用的利器，蘇聯並不會輕易放棄的；只因爲當時要討好西方民主國家，特別是要獲得美國的大量租借法案物資，於是便以一紙通告，將這在列寗時代便已成立了的共產國際宣布解散了。此在明眼人的心理，他們都明白，共產國際的宣布解散，無非是莫斯科所玩的一套手法；對於國際共產運動，世界革命運動，初不因共產國際的解散而蒙受影饗。此次共產國際的再度出現，只不過是選擇了一個他們認爲最適宜的時候，將這國際組織重又宣布公開出現，好像本來他們在幕後扮演，現在是公然登台而已。正彷彿中國共產黨在抗戰期問似乎願和國民政府合作，到了勝利以後，終有一天公然叛變，一樣不足爲奇。</p>
<p>無疑地，此次共產國際的再出現，是對杜魯門主義及馬歇爾計劃的直接答復·據報傳在羅馬尼亞京城所發表的新共產國際宣言，歐洲九國的共產黨以蘇聯爲領袖，無異向全世界宣戰；而此項戰爭不僅只限於意識方面，且更及於政治乃至經濟各方面，是一種全面戰爭的宣告，以工人階段的力量向他們所謂「奴役歐洲」的「帝國主義」鬥爭。所以，這次共產國際的再度出現，是重新打着「反帝」戰爭的旗號而展開的，而以打擊美國爲其主要的目的。對於這一姿態，我們也並不感到驚奇。因爲共產國際自一九一九年在莫斯科成立以來，一貫的以奉行克林姆宮的意旨爲能事。而在希特勒侵蘇以前，克林姆宮固無日不咀咒英美等國爲帝國主義者。只要克林姆宮決定如何對蘇聯爲最有利，共產國際便奉命惟謹地加以執行一九一九年至一九二六年時代，在謝諾維也導下的主張世界革命的共產國際，到了一九年便變爲擁護蘇聯建國，所謂「社會主義在一個國家」的共產國際了。因爲要配合當時的蘇聯外交政策，共淤國際在當時也企圖在一種和平的　圍中與蘇聯以外的世界相處。到了一九三五年蘇聯的外交政策一變，共產國際便又在各處展開了所謂「人民陣綫」運動，企圖滲入；此後的解散和今日的再現，又是蘇聯外交政策的反映，更不待言·所以所謂共產國際，根本就只是克林姆宮的一種工具罷了！</p>
<p>講到「反帝」，這在我們中國尤共應該特別加以指出。因爲今天帝國主義在中國的殘餘，若不平等條約，若租借地，若外國使用軍港，多隨這次抗日戰爭的勝利而消滅。而正在這個時侯，沙皇時代取自中國的「特權」，如今却又爲高唱「反帝」的蘇聯承襲了去，可是這些「特權」，在列寗時代的蘇聯原已自動放棄了的。則所謂「帝國主義」，在今天的中國人民心目中當有一番更深切的認識。那末，此次共產國際所宣布的全面「反帝」戰爭，中國人民當必知所適從？</p>
<p>基於此一觀點，中國人民更不得不站在中正的立縐。由於此次共產國際的再出現，一個世界之分成兩個壁壘，旗幟更益顯明，鬥爭亦將更趨劇烈。此在世界第二次大戰後的今日，誠屬不宰！但局勢旣然如此，我們於此際倘再採取敷衍苟安的政策，恐終會有第二慕尼黑的出現。所以我們現在萬不能再取姑息手段來增高一方的氣燄。以指責，察其用意，似乎也想鼓吹在國際間來一次「政治協商會議」，好叫一方放下武器，來做另一方「順民」，以重敦「老大」，「老二」的「史弟之誼」。果如他們的說法，好像天下罪亞一切都應歸於援助他國善後復興的美國「老大」；這未免太帶着主觀氣氛了吧。我們並不是說美國一切行動都全對，但我們絕對不同意在今天的世界再來像張伯倫時代一樣的一味姑息。</p>
<p>此次共產國際的再出現，無疑地，必將影饗到當前中國的局勢。基於三民主義的中國，原和共產主義不相容。我們的民族主義，和我們所倡導的全民政治，在本質上，與以無產階級專政爲中心的共產主義極權政體是不兩立的。不管國際局勢如何變化，我們當前更應加倍努力於動員戡亂的完成。我們願全國人民懷於「共產黨無祖國」的口號，為了我們的祖國，我們來加倍努力於我們戡亂建國使命的及早完成！</p>

<h3>京若干政界人士對共產國際評述</h3>
<p>（上接一版）邵力子表示，渠不願對此事發表任何意見，惟稱有人認爲此爲第三國際之復活，實係錯誤之見，因第三國際早經取消，如欲予以定一新名詞，則可以「第四國際」呼之，且此項組織偏於歐洲，與我不生重大關係。吾人不必考慮親蘇之途徑。靑年黨府委余家菊稱，美蘇對立之尖銳化，實爲今日世界政治潮流之「惡化」，此項聯合組織以美國爲敵對，我人處此境遇，惟有加强團結，澄淸吏治，從事　設．無論外交內政，均求獨立自主，庶可免捲入此漩渦。我今後外交陣錢，有人主張親蘇，惟吾人當考慮以下四條件：　旅大之交還我國，　蘇是否能助我解決中共問題？　蘇是否能助我建設？　蘇是否能助我解決新疆糾紛？同時，吾人尤應硏究在何種情况下，蘇聯始能與我親善。余氏認爲必須具備下述四種情况：　美軍事之退出中國，　中國放棄美國之經濟援助，　中國朝野對蘇應有善意宣傳，　中國物資應協助蘇聯建設。在上述兩種考慮之　衡輕重，我是否可親蘇，自可獲得結論。組織部部長陳立夫稱，此事並不足以驚奇，因共產國際　已取消，其工作並未停頓。此不過名義上之恢復而已。世界上若干問題均因壁壘森嚴，不能協調，深盼彼此容忍，以整個世界人類幸福爲重。參政員武肇煦稱，共產黨國際與蘇聯並無分別，當一九四三年蘇取消第三國際，乃懼美對蘇有顧忌而出此也。</p>
<p>中宣部副部長　　　稱，東歐九國之聯合組織，具有兩項意義：一爲政治方面之對美攻勢。目前正値聯合國舉行大會，蘇代表維辛斯基曾在大會强烈抨擊美國。九國共黨宣言於此際發表，目的在加强蘇代表之發言聲勢，並暗示必要時蘇有退出聯大可能；一爲經濟方面之對美攻勢。參加此項組織者，幾均爲東歐國家。馬歇爾之經濟援歐計劃發表後，蘇曾以莫洛托夫計劃與之相抗。此次九國合作即爲經濟上東歐集團對抗美國及西歐集團之表示。陶氏並稱，此事雖發生於東歐，針對美國，然其影響絕不止於東歐一隅，舉世均將受其影響。</p>
<h3>陶希聖談話內容</h3>
<p>（上接一版）余今特爲指出明顯之事實，即范文瀾主編之「中國通史簡編」由新知書店出版。共匪總部尚在延安時，價設立僞中央硏究院，以范文瀾爲院長。該院硏究員王實味著「野百合花」一文，批評共黨缺乏人性，曾受該院嚴厲檢討，卅」年六月廿八日及廿九日延安「解放日報」載有范文瀾叙述僞中央硏究院檢討經過之文字，可資參攷，檢討結果，王實味乃受共匪殘酷之處分。僞中央硏究院及范文瀾之喧騰人口，即以此事爲契機。該院以中國歷史硏究會名義，於民國卅年編成「中國通史簡編」一書，由延安新華書店出版，卅年十二月十三日及十四日延安「解放日報」　有該書寫成之經過，而「解放日報」刋載「陝甘寗邊區新華書局廣告」，即以該書之廣告居首。（例如卅二年四月三日「解放日報」即有此廣告），比及延安爲國軍所收復，該書乃改由上海新知書店印行。此一事可以證明民盟之出版事業，　不過爲共匪作宣傳工作。該兩書局所印行之書，大批爲匪發動變亂，割據地盤，分裂領土，背叛國家作導綫。其歷史作品更誘惑靑年，鄙棄中國歷史，仇視中國文化，　傷民族自信，自尊心，爲共匪製造背叛祖國之器材。余願喚起學術文化界之注意。</p>

<p>（續昨第五版）（己）各大進出口貿易公司情形之調査</p>
<p>中國孚中實業公司査該公司係民國卅五年由交通銀行，中國國貨銀行，金城銀行合資組織而成，全部股本國　三億元，分三萬股，每股一萬元，計交通銀行出資一億元，國貨銀行投資一億五千萬元，金城銀行投資五千萬元。其股東，交通銀行由錢新之　五人代表，國貨銀行由孔庸之等八人代表，金城銀行由周作民等四人代表，以錢新之爲董事長，宋子良爲總經理，沈鶴年，陸品琴為協理。總公司設於上海，另設分公司於紐約。其業務爲進出口貿易，計獨家經理美國廠商之貨品，有偉力斯汽車公司，及西屋電氣公司等十二家。査該公司之外匯結購情形，截至現在止，共請准美金一，五八五，〇八六，〇九元，自備外匯一三七，八一七，四三美元，百分之五十以上均係購　汽車，百分之二十係購買無綫電器材，其餘均係准許進口物資。關於該公司之汽車購入情形，經査共購入吉普卡七百八十輛，旅行汽車一百〇一輛，卡特拉克脾汽車二輛，除卡特拉克車廠價超出規定國額外，至吉普車列入進口稅則第二五六三〇項，作爲一公噸以下之輕便卡軍，依照規定，自卅五年四月廿九日起，亦應暫予停止輸入，而該公司於卅五年五月以後，共進口七百四十五輛，據海關報單簽註，計五月一日五月廿三及六月二日共　口一八九輛，係於四月廿九日以前　已起　在途，又自卅五年五月廿三日至卅六年一月廿八日，　進口五四九　，係於四月廿九日前業已　購，以現款或　用狀付結購價，由海關按章核准進口，査閱證件，尚屬相符。惟査該公司結匯帳册，僅三十五年四月十日及同月二十四日兩次訂購吉普車二百輛，共付定金美匯四九，〇〇〇，〇〇元，其餘吉普車美匯七六七，二四〇，〇〇元，均係四月二十九日以後，並有半數以上在八月以後陸續結匯。至旅行汽車一〇一輛，係憑政府發給MC11-49及，MC11-101號許可證，經報關査騐，准予進口，尚無不合。又査該公司營業情形，足資注意者，爲本公司與紐約分公司之關係問題。據該公司協理陸品琴談稱：紐約之孚中國際公司（Fachung　HnternationolCorporation，即係孚中實業股份有限公司之分公司，承銷偉力斯汽車合約，亦係上海總公司署名，而實際上偉力斯東進口，均由紐約分公司洽訂，總公司對車輛一項，作爲託銷貨物處理人賬，所有結匯報關提運等費，均記入紐約分公司往來帳戶，分公司僅付百分之十五手續費與總公司，分公司一切業務及財務，均從未向總公司報告，此種現象可能發生下列弊　：一，隱匿利益，逃避國稅，二，　　業務眞實情况，三，紕約分公司在　于經營業務，眞實情形旣無報告與一定之稽核，是否有吸收僑匯情事，亦無從知悉（詳附件十三）。</p>

<h3>監院　報吿書　全文　（上接第二版）第二結論</h3>
<p>委員等根據以上事實之調査，認爲下列各點，足資注意</p>
<p>甲，自抗戰勝利以後，國內與國際情勢變更，一方面國內於戰後百廢待興，物資缺乏，經濟枯竭，通貨膨脹，一方對各國交通與貿易恢復後，外國貨品如潮湧入，遂形成驚人之入超數字，於是外匯問題不淮影響國內經濟情形，且關涉政府之財政金融政策，我政府於勝利之初，以人民於八年艱苦之餘，財力充裕者均大量購進外國物資，以爲補充享受，政府當時以握有大量之黃金外匯，對於外貨之湧進，亦採取極端自由放任政策，自卅四年八月至卅五年十一月間，在此種放任政策之下，政府原存六百萬盎司之黃金，與九億以上之美金，大半消耗，不惟幣制未能改革，物價未能穩定，且此大量黃金美鈔，大半均未能以充建設性之使用，加以外匯之管制，初無健全之　構，由宋前院長一人核發使用，多所浪費，（參閱本報告第一節乙項及本年春季本院黃金風潮案調查報告書），此殊爲國家之里大損失，而宋前院長不能不負相當責任者。</p>
<p>乙，自去年十一月十七日以後，以外匯逐漸减少，物價日形高漲，本年二月更以黃金風潮發生，全國爲之震動，乃先後有修正進出口貿易暫行辦法及經濟緊急措施方案之公布，對於外匯由極度之自由放任，進入極度之管制緊縮，在此極度變更過程中，不惟表現政府之外匯政策有呈緊張紊亂之象，而使市塲人心不能趨於安定，物價繼續狂漲，且以機構迭次變更，法令屢有更改，於是豪商鉅賈，得以從容，操縱投機，一般正常商民，則苦於不知所措，加以一般與論之鼔吹挑剔，隨致商民對於政府之措施日趨隔聞，政策之推行日就困難，外匯官價雖固定於一。二〇〇〇之牌價，而其黑市與官價距離日遠，致近數月來，一切僑匯及私人外匯均流於黑市外匯，收入漸形絕跡，於是乃不得不更有八月十七日對於外匯市價與官市採用平行之機動辦法，今後自宜於外匯管制機構與辦法，有一周密適宜之決策，以免朝令夕改，政府商民兩受其困。</p>
<p>丙，我國以八年抗戰勝利後，又益以共匪猖獗，以致經濟枯竭，民不聊生，舉國上下，爲求以堅苦奮鬥之精神，完成建國之大業，故最近中央復有厲行節約明令之頒布，然觀夫上述一年餘來五億餘元美金之使用（出售之黃金不在此數內），用之於建設及文化敎育，人民生活改善者實少，而用之於消費方面者實佔多數，例如紙烟，烟葉，罐頭食品，果品，玻璃用品等，實不免近於浪費，今後政府在節約原則之下，應擴大非日用必需品及非建設用品之禁止入口範圍，（即擴大修正進出口暫行辦法附表四之物品範圍），至於夜體燃料，亦應嚴格管制　用途，而達節約之目的，以免如現在上海各大商埠自用汽軍之充斥，浪費汽油也。</p>
<p>丁，自去年實施對進口貿易，加以絞嚴格之管制，以一般外商頗有不滿之處，本年三月合衆社訊，及七月紐約下午報訊，即爲明例。此等輿論，經委員等之考察，均不免有下列兩種誤解：　不明眞實情形，例如上述合衆社及倫道爾均指摘無錢電機及電氣冰箱爲嚴禁入口之奢侈品，而世界貿易公司，中央信託局，物資供應局，均大量運輸入口，姑不論上述各國營機關所運入此類物品之數量如何，然無綫電機，電氣冰箱一類物品，自抗戰勝利迄今，始終依照稅則，未嘗視爲奢侈品而予禁止入口，中外商民在一定合法申請手續之下，均能有獲得此類貨品入口之機會。　誇大之惡意宣傳，中國久居經濟殖民地之地位，過去一般外商在華假有租界，及其他種種特權，在華貿易，均居絕對優越地位，我國進出口商人，多仰其鼻息。勝利後，政府爲適應我國當前經濟環境，管制稍嚴，國營事業機關或不免有優越之處，洋商則感從來未有之不便，乃爲誇大之宣傳挑剔，孚中等公司固有其不合之處，而有須糾正者，然絕不能即行爲誣蔑我政府之口實，更不能謂爲利用政治及其他壓力將外商排出中國市塲，且孚中揚子等公司所代理之英美行號，其銷售貨品，亦即英美企業家所製造之物資，用以推銷於中國市塲者也。（明日續刋）</p>

<p>〔聯合社靑島七日電﹞政府厲行節約，規定各舞塲於九月底以前一律關閉，但此間各大伴舞酒排間迄仍照常營業，據市府方面人士稱：舞歷不停業，並非由於舞塲老　或舞女之反對，乃便利美國軍人一點着想，市政府已向中央請示，正待覆命。過去市府一度決定封閉所有舞廳，美軍常局即耍求保留若干所，以供美國軍人之用，摒絕華人舞客，殊不可能。</p>

<h3>本報與保黎醫院合辦助產　辦法與人和紅十字會尙賢等三院相同</h3>
<p>在今年二月間，本報與人和醫院，紅十字會第一醫院，尙　婦孺醫院合辦「貧婦助產」運動的時候，我們惶悚的謝絕了多家願意與本報合作的醫院，當時惟恐人力和物力的不充分，但是這三家醫院的服務精神，和爲善的然　，却是始終銘刻在我們的心房裏。</p>
<p>八個月已經過去，「貧婦助產」遝動，已經對一百多位產婦給予了援助，使她們獲得了科學化的生產照料。因爲經費的關係，我們不能盡量的擴大，爲補救這個缺憾，保黎醫院給予我們莫大的援助，在四個月裏面，他們慷慨地對還些向隅的產婦們施捨了援助，昨天，我們接到保黎醫院的來信說：</p>
<p>「謹啓者：敝院與貴報合作以來，已救助貧苦產婦達數十人之多，茲爲慶祝貴報七十五週年，擬與貴報合辦貧婦助產，以示服務社會之微忱，尙乞核奪爲感。」</p>
<p>我們非常榮幸，能够得到新生力量的補充時我們也為無數貧窮的產婦慶幸。</p>

<h3>一個老皮匠的故事　英·高斯華綏著　林鳳藻譯</h3>
<p>我很小時候就認識他，因爲他是給我父親做鞋子的。他和他哥哥同住在一條小街上，兩個小舖子合在一起—現在已經沒有了，不過當時在倫敦西區佔有很時髦的地位。</p>
<p>這舖子的比衆不同處，就是肅靜。舖面上沒有標出承做什麼皇親國戚的生意的字樣—只寫着他自己的德國名字「格式勒兄弟商店」；窗揠裏擺着幾雙鞋子。我記得，我總不明白，爲什麽窗櫃裏老擺着那幾雙鞋子。他從來不做現成貨的，只做定貨。如果說他做的東西不合脚，那好像是不可思議的。那些鞋子難道是他買來擺在那兒的？那也好像是不可思議的。他決不會把別人做的皮貨放在自己屋子裹的。再者，那些鞋十實在太漂亮了；壁如那雙漆皮舞鞋，那雙難以形容的細長的鞋子，上好的皮子配着布，使人看了垂涎；又如那雙欔黃的高統馬靴，雖是簇新，而帶着奇怪的灰暗色，好像已經穿過一百年似的。這些皮鞋，只有那看見鞋子靈魂的人，才做得出來—眞是一切鞋子的精靈的化身。當然，這些思想是在我成年以後才有的，不過當我在他那裹做鞋子時—大約十四歲左右—我意識中，隱隱覺得他和他哥哥有某種的尊嚴。因爲做鞋子—他做的鞋子—不論在當時或現在，在我看來，是一件神奇而了不得的事。</p>
<p>我記得很淸楚，有一天，當我對他伸着小脚量樣子的時候，我難爲情的說：</p>
<p>「格式勒先生，做擎不很麻煩罷？」</p>
<p>從他帶有識刺意味的紅鈀髪鬚中間，突然露出一個微笑，他回答道：「這是一種藝術！」</p>
<p>他這人，黃而皺的臉，紅而曲的頭髮和鬍鬚，臉上擊齊的皺紋斜拖到嘴角，滿口單調的喉音，很有點像是皮子做成的；因爲皮子是一種帶有譏刺意味的東西，强靱，週笨。他面上神態也是這樣，只是他一對藍灰色的眼睛裹，隱隱藏着理想家樸實的力量。他的哥哥很像他—雖在各方面比他差一些，也很勤快—因此在我早年，總要等談過了話，才能把他們分辨淸楚。如果我聽說，「我要問我弟弟，」那就是他哥哥；如果不這樣說，那就是他自已。</p>
<p>一個人長大以後，變得粗野，到處掛脹，但無論如何總不會在格式勒兄弟商店掛賬的。譬如說，你欠了他兩雙鞋十的錢，你又跑去，對着他鋼絲限鏡裏的藍色限睛伸出你的脚，表示你仍舊是他的主顧—那似乎不是一件體面的事。</p>
<p>實際上，常到他那兒去，是不可能的—他的鞋子太經穿了。它們有一種超時間的特質—你也可以說，它們裏面縫着皮鞋的精髓。</p>
<p>一個人到店舖去，總帶着這樣的心情：「快把東西拿來，讓我走」！但到這店舖，却另有一種安靜的意味，好像走進敎堂一樣；你得坐在那張唯一的木椅上等着—因爲那兒總是沒有人的。不多一會，從屋子裏的頂角—那裹相當暗，而帶有皮子的柔和氣味，這就是舖子—露出他哥哥的臉，往下張望。接着是一陣喉音，木底拖鞋在狹窄的木扶梯上的答而下。他到你面前來了，沒有穿外衣，身體有點兒傴，擊着皮樹裙，袖子往上捲起，眼睛一霎一霎—好像才從皮鞋的夢裏醒來，又好像一隻貓頭　被白畫的光亮驚動了。表示着不安。</p>
<p>我就說：「格式勒先生，您好？替我做一雙俄國皮子的鞋子，好不好」？</p>
<p>他一句話也不說，回到他原來的地方，或走到舖子的另一部分，而我呢，繼續坐在木椅上等着，嗅着皮子的氣味，一會兒，他回來了，瘦薄而靑筋滿佈的手裹；拿着一塊金褐色的皮子，眼請對着皮子，嘴裏說道：「多漂亮的皮子」！我也鑲着稱讚了一番。他又說：「什麼時候要」？我回答道：「啊！看您方便，愈快愈好」。他就說：「兩個禮拜，行不行」？如果是他哥哥的話，就會這樣說；「等我問我弟弟」！</p>
<p>於是我輕輕說道：「謝謝！格式勒先生，再會了」。他就回答道，「再會了」—但他的眼睛還在望着手裏的皮子。我向門口走去的時候，聽到木底拖鞋的答之聲，他正走上扶梯，回到皮鞋的夢裏去。但如果我要做一雙他從來沒有給我做過的新式皮鞋，他就愼重起來了—他把我的鞋脫下，放在手裏擱了許久，細細觀察，批評，但也表示着愛好，好像在追憶他所創造的光彩，而又在責備人家把這傑作糟蹋了。然後，把我的脚放在一張紙上，把鉛筆沿着脚邊再三鈎畫，又把額抖的手指撫摩我的足趾，設身處地的體會到我需要的中心。</p>
<p>有一天，我碰巧對他說：「格式勒先生，你看，前次那雙日常穿的鞋子吱吱的呌了」。這一天，我是不能忘記的。</p>
<p>他聽了我的話，對我望着，許久沒有回答，好像要我收回或修正我的話。然後他說：</p>
<p>「這鞋子不應該會吱吱的呌」</p>
<p>「不過，它實在如是」。</p>
<p>「你一定是不留意把它們弄潮了」？</p>
<p>「我想，沒有」。</p>
<p>他聽了這話，眼神低了下來，好像竭力追憶那雙鞋子。我覺得非常抱歉，我不該提起這嚴重的事情。</p>
<p>「把那鞋子送同來！」他說，「我要仔細盾看」。</p>
<p>我心中對那雙發響的皮鞋起了同情。我可以想像，他一定要　着腰，帶着憂響的好奇心，費許多功夫去檢査這鞋子。</p>
<p>他慢慢說道：「有許多鞋十，生來就壞。如果這鞋十修不好，我就不算你的錢」。</p>
<p>有一次（只有一次），我疏忽了。我穿了一雙在一家大公司裹買的鞋子，走到他舖子裘去了。那雙鞋子原是因臨時需要而買的。他雖答應仍給我做鞋子，但沒有把皮子給我看。我可以覺得，他的眼睛釘着我那個鱉脚鞋面。最後，他說：</p>
<p>「這不是我做的皮鞋」。</p>
<p>這語調不是生氣，也不是難過，更不是厭惡，但裏面帶着一種靜　的成分，呌你的血液凝凍。他伸出手來，用一個指頭壓壓左脚的皮鞋，那裏雖做得時髦，却不很舒適。</p>
<p>他說：「這裹碍脚。那些大公司是沒鵝自尊心的。眞是鱉脚貨」！接着，好像有一種內在的東西使他失云了自制，他說了許多嚴厲的話。只鵝在這一次，我聽到他說起他生意的情況和困難</p>
<p>他說：「他們把生意全搶走了，他們靠廣告，不靠工作。我們是愛鞋子的，但他們把生意搶云了。現在已經到了這種地步—我沒鵝工作可做了。一年不如一年，你瞧着罷」。我望着他全是縐紋的面孔，我看到我從前沒有留意的東西，那就是艱苦的境遇與艱苦的掙扎—突然間我看見他紅鬚已經鵝許多變得灰白了。</p>
<p>我竭力解釋，我吿訴他我在何種情形之下買那雙倒霉的鞋十。但他的面容和聲音使我深深感動。於是在幾分鐘內定下了許多雙皮鞋。但報復的女神在作怪了。這些鞋子比什麼都耐穿。差不多在兩年中，我實在不必再上他那兒去做鞋子。</p>
<p>最後，我上他舖子去了。狠奇怪，我發現他舖子外面的兩個小窗櫃之一已經寫上別人的名字，另外一個皮鞋匠的名字—當然咯，是承做皇家的鞋子的。那些看慣了的鞋子，再也不是疏疏落落的佔據尊嚴的地位了，只是擠在一個小窗櫃裏。裏面那間縮小了的小舖子，氣味比從前更重，光線比從前更暗。而且，那張望，那本底拖鞋的格　聲，來得比從前更慢了。最後，他站在我面前，隔着那付銹了的鐵框眼鏡對我望着，說道：「……先生，不是嗎？「啊！格式勒先生」我吞吐的說，「你知道，你的鞋子實在太好了！你瞧，這鞋還很體面呢」！我對他伸出脚來。他望着。</p>
<p>「是的」，他說，「現在一般人好像都不要穿好鞋子了」。</p>
<p>爲了要逃避他責備的眼色和聲音，我連忙說：「你這舖子怎麽改變了」？</p>
<p>他平靜的回答這：「開支太大了。你要做鞋子嗎」？</p>
<p>我雖只要兩雙鞋子，但定了三雙，悄悄的離開了。我雖不很知道，但我總感覺，他心裏認爲我也是和他作對的一個人；或許不是和他本人作對，而是和他鞋子的理想作對。我想，一個人大概對這感覺不甚介意；因爲，又過了好幾個月，才又去光顧他的舖子。我記得，我心裏這樣想：「啊！好罷，我不能不理會那老頭子—還是去罷！也許我會碰到他哥哥」！</p>
<p>因爲我知道，就他哥哥的性格而言，他不會開口譴責，其實連閉口表示也不會有的。</p>
<p>到了舖子裏，我放心了。出來的是他哥哥，手裏拿着一塊皮子。「啊，格式勒先生，您好？」我說。</p>
<p>他走近前來，瞅着我。</p>
<p>「我還好，可是我哥哥死了。」他慢吞吞的說。</p>
<p>我知道原來是他自己—但是多麼蒼老—我從前沒有聽到他提過他哥哥的名字，我嚇了一跳，輕輕說：「啊！太不幸了！」</p>
<p>他回答說：「是呀，他爲人很好，他會做上好的鞋子，可是他死了。」他摸摸頭頂，頭髮突然脫了許多，變得和他可憐的哥哥的一樣稀薄。他吿訴我，他哥哥如何死的。「他失去了舖子，老是難過。你要鞋子嗎？」他舉起手裹的皮子說：「多漂亮的皮子。」</p>
<p>我定做了好幾雙。隔了好久才送來—但比從前的更好。簡直穿不壞，過了不久，我出國去了</p>
<p>過了一年多，回到倫教。我第一次去的，就是我老朋友的舖子。我離開的時候，他像是六十歲的人，回來的時候，他像是七十五歲了，窮苦，孱弱，顫抖。這一次見面，他引領的不認識我了</p>
<p>我心裹很難過，說：「啊！格式勒先生，你做的鞋子眞好！你瞧，我在出國期間，幾乎一直穿它，現在還沒有半舊，不是嗎？」</p>
<p>他對我的鞋子看了好一會—是一雙俄國皮子的鞋。他的面容似乎恢復了從前的穩定。他把手放到我鞋面上說：</p>
<p>「這裹合適麼？我記得，做這雙鞋子的時候，費了許多勁。」</p>
<p>我告訴他，這鞋子非常合適</p>
<p>他說：「你還要鞋子嗎？我可以做得快些；我現在很閒。」</p>
<p>我回答說：「好的，好的！什麽鞋子都要—各種式樣的鞋子！」</p>
<p>「我要做一個新的樣子。你的脚一定大了一些了。」他替我畫了脚樣，又摸我脚趾，動作非常慢。只有一次他抬着頭望我，他說；</p>
<p>「我有沒有吿訴你，我哥哥死了？」</p>
<p>他變得非常孱弱，令人雖過。我巴不得就離開他。</p>
<p>我已經忘了那定做的鞋子了。但一夭晚上鞋子汾來了，我打開包裹，把四雙鞋子排成一隊。然後一隻一隻試樣。毫無毛病。樣子，尺碼，寬緊，和皮子的質料，樣樣都好，這是他給我做的最好的鞋子。在一雙普通走路的鞋子口裏，我發現他的賬厘。雖價目和平常一樣，但我非常驚愕。在季節給賬以前，他是從來不送賬單的。我飛奔下樓，簽了一張支票，馬上寄川。</p>
<p>一個禮拜以後，經過這條小街，我想跑去吿訴他，新做的鞋子如何合脚。我走到舖子前面，找不到他的名字，那黑漆皮細長的舞鞋，上好的皮子裝着皮統，再有那暗灰的馬靴，還在窗櫃裏</p>
<p>我走進去，心裏非常不安。在這兩個小舖十裏—又拚成一個了—有一個英國而孔的年靑人。</p>
<p>我問：「格式勒先生在家嗎？」</p>
<p>他望着我，他的眼色很怪，但表示好感。</p>
<p>他說：「先生，他不在，不在。不過我們很願意聽你吩咐。我們頂了這舖子了。你一定在隔壁門面上看到我們的名字。我們給許多要人定做鞋子。」</p>
<p>「是的，是的」，我說；「但是格式勒先生呢？」</p>
<p>他回答說：「啊！死子」。「死了！我上禮拜三還收到他給我做的鞋子呢』。</p>
<p>「啊！」他說；「眞是駭人的事。可憐的老頭子把自己餓死了」。</p>
<p>「天呀！」</p>
<p>「醫生說的，是慢性饑餓！你想，他工作的辦法是這樣的！要開舖子；但又不讓任何人碰他的鞋十。他接了一椿生意，得花上許多時間。人家等得不耐煩了。於是主顧全跑了。但他還坐在那兒，不停的工作—我願意替他說一句公平話—倫敦沒有一個人能比他做出更好的鞋子！請您看看和他競爭的人！他從來不登廣吿！他要用最好的皮子，而且要自己動手。啊，結果是這樣。他有他的想頭，您看看有什麽辦法？」</p>
<p>「不過，飢餓……」</p>
<p>「像一般人說的，我講話也許過甚其詞——但我親自知道，他直到最後，還是日夜做他的鞋于。我常注意他。他從來沒有時間好好的吃飯；屋子裏從來不留一個銅板。他的錢全花在皮十和房租上面了。他居然能活了這許多年，我簡直不能瞭解。他常常斷炊。他眞是一個脚色。不過他做很好的鞋十。」</p>
<p>「是的，」我說，「他做很好的鞋子。」</p>
<p>我轉過身，立刻走了出去，因爲我不願意讓那年靑人知道，我的眼睛裏包着淚水差不多連看也看不見了。</p>

<p>詩人只能聽命於眞實與靈感，靈感也是一種眞實和一種自然。雨果溶東</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>不說天津人圓滑，就拿普通老於世故的人來說，在這渝陷局而衷這「偵包狗三個字的露骨形容，也不肯對陌路生人隨口說出。　羣常然覺得有些意外；沒防到她希望打聽的話，這麼不費功夫，十成收獲了。她更沒想到淪陷了的天津，竟敢把樣忌諱的言語，隨口嚷了出來；就不說愛國的話，至少證明了他們痛恨敵人的本心。這呌耀羣想起了「燕趙多慷慨悲歌之士」那句話，天津人有時是十二分豪放的；假使動了脾氣的話。同時，這一區的秘密工作，也頗有效力，所以民氣仍舊十分旺盛。</p>
<p>從這兩位招待口裏，　羣知道了這人妖買沙夫，七七前後，早就到了天津，一直擔任着偵探狗的職務，專在上中下三等旅館裏，晃去晃來；有時高起興來，還穿上軍裝馬袴，呌些窯姐來陪她喝酒。</p>
<p>「可又不一定」；最後二位招待又吿訴耀羣：「就在兩天前頭，日本鬼子跑來抓人，—兩位咱們政府的密探—倒是她給放走的。這傢伙究竟搗什麼鬼，咱們有些閙不淸」。</p>
<p>耀羣剛回到二十七號屋子裹，這個人妖買沙失接踵而至。擘頭就給耀羣一個冲天砲；</p>
<p>「紀小姐，咱們「打開天窗說亮話」，無當然有任務，用不着說。您能不能開誠佈公，把目標公開一下：您單是派遺來收案情華的？還是專來擔任聯絡工作，預備把學生，靑年們，組織起來？還是帶了辦法來，想把那幾位同志搭救出來？—您知道，前日半夜，一共破了兩偶秘密電台，逮去了七八名同志哪」！</p>
<p>您要是耀羣，替她設身處想一想，您對還買沙夫傢伙，這突如其來一個冲天砲，怎麼招架？同時，這麽一針見血，把耀羣的底子，搯出了一大半；您身當其境，預備怎麽應付？要是呑吞吐吐地，說一半含一半，那是表現您不够材料，非給這傢伙笑掉大牙不可。要是完全否認？那不僅否認不了·還鬧得您是初出道的「嫩　」。簡直要呌人看不起。您得知道，這傢伙神通廣大，發非拿住了把柄，絕對不敢這麽冒冒失失，跑來跟耀軍這等當面　對面鼓的公開談判；所以說，縱然否認，也是否認不了；耀羣才高氣傲，囑裹肯在勁敵面前，走這下乘，落下笑柄？</p>
<p>那麽，您打算怎麽應付？是否放得光棍一些，拍拍胸脯：「你老爺行不改名，坐不更姓…」拚着吃下一套江湖過節，爽爽氣氣，一口承認：「老爺是幹這個的」；然後，好，則携手訂交；說翻了，當然各顯本領，門個死活？</p>

<h3>Political Declaration of War Between Two Major Camps: We Are Closely Watching the Development; UN Organizations Will Be Sacrificed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Since the news arrived here that the communist leaders of nine Eastern European nations issued a declaration establishing the "Information Bureau", political figures have paid attention to it. According to a responsible government official, the government is closely watching its development and hopes to obtain more information about it. A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the grounds that sufficient information had not been received, even refusing to comment on whether such noteworthy news from the Soviet Union was diplomatic in nature. The Soviet Embassy has made no additional announcements.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Great concern has been expressed here regarding the appearance of a new Communist International. Today, reporters separately interviewed political figures Shao Lizi, Chen Lifu, Tao Xisheng, and others to ask for their personal opinions on the matter. Each gave a brief commentary on the matter. (The content of their opinions can be found in the first column of the second page)</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] It is reported that a joint organization of communist parties has also appeared in East Asia, namely the Northeast Administrative Committee jointly formed by the CCP, the Korean Communist Party, and the Mongolian Communist Party. When reporters inquired with officials about this, it was claimed that the government had not yet received any reports regarding this matter.</p>
<p>[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 7th] Two years ago, the United Nations was born amid great hope. Today, the United Nations is crestfallen, caught in the political war between the two giants, the US and the USSR, which spans the globe. The division between the two camps is exceptionally clear, but both sides consider France and Italy to be allies. These two countries are the direct stakes in the dispute, as communism and capitalism in those countries will soon clash head-on in the coming months. The Soviet Union's actions (establishing a new Communist International) will have two major effects: The Marshall Plan to aid European recovery will surely be submitted to Congress; The Four Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the German-Austrian peace treaty, scheduled to be held in London next month, is likely to fail, and the institution of the Big Four conference may collapse with it. However, UN representatives unanimously believe that the ultimate sacrifice will be the United Nations itself. (For reactions from the US, Britain, and France, see page 3)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Inspects Troops in Beiping, Encourages Inspection Team to Handle Cases Impartially According to Law, Gives Compensation to Employees Who Died Building Roads</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 7th] On the morning of the 7th, Chairman Chiang received Wu Qiwei, Deputy Director of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, and Shangguan Yunxiang and Ma Fawu, Deputy Directors of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters, at his residence. At 9:40 AM, he left his residence to inspect the 208th Division of the Youth Army in the western suburbs, returning to the city at 1:00 PM. At 4:00 PM, he received Wan Fulin and Zhang Ting'e. At 4:30 PM, he received Shi Zhiren, Director of the Beiping-Tianjin Railway Bureau. At 5:00 PM, he received Prince De and Chen Shaowu, representatives of the Mongolian Association of Fellow Townsmen in Beiping, and He Xianlin, Director of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission's Beiping Office. At 5:30 PM, he received Li Sicong, Gu Zhongxiu, Hu Boyue, Shi Zizhou, and others from the Beiping-Tianjin Military Discipline and Official Conduct Inspection Team. At 6:00 PM, he received Lian Ru, Tian Gengxin, Lei Zhenyuan, and Zhou Lianchi from the Manchu Cultural Advancement Association. At 9:00 PM in the evening, he received over a dozen members of the Beiping-Tianjin-Hebei-Jehol Party and Group Unification Committee.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 7th] Chairman Chiang arrived in the western suburbs at 11:15 AM on the 7th to inspect the Youth Army. The Chairman first ascended the reviewing stand. After inspecting the entire field, he and Li Zongren, Sun Lianzhong, and Wu Xiaoya, commander of the 208th Division, inspected the parade in jeeps, expressing his deep satisfaction with the soldiers' morale. After the inspection, he returned to the platform to give a speech lasting 40 minutes, generally stating that the responsibility of the revolutionary army is to build a new, independent, free, and strong China, and that the Youth Army has a heavy responsibility and should especially practice what they preach in defending the country and protecting the people. He also emphasized strict discipline, obedience to orders, and setting an example for the general army in their relations with the people. After the speech, he rested briefly at the division headquarters, then inspected the barracks, recreation hall, exhibition hall, and restrooms for about ten minutes before summoning officers above the rank of company commander to give another speech, returning to the city at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 7th] The members of the Military Discipline Inspection Team, led by Li Sicong, called on the Chairman at approximately 5:00 PM on the 7th to report. The Chairman greatly appreciated their work and encouraged them to handle cases impartially according to the law and to implement the central government's determination to rectify military discipline and official conduct.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 7th] Shi Zhiren paid a visit to Chairman Chiang to report on the situation of the railways in the Beiping-Tianjin area and the resumption of traffic on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, and recounted the efforts of the railway employees in repairing the railways. In total, 342 employees of various railway bureaus were captured by the bandits while performing their duties, and 74 were brutally murdered by the bandits. The Chairman was extremely concerned upon hearing this and immediately instructed Director Shi to comfort the families of those captured and to provide compensation to the families of those who died in service, in accordance with the rank of military officers and in accordance with the regulations for compensating fallen soldiers. Those who have made particularly meritorious contributions should be formally recommended by Director Shi, and the government will give them commendations, and hopes that they will continue to work hard to fulfill the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Garrison Command Announces: Landmines to Be Buried in the City and Suburbs</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 7th] The Tianjin Garrison Command announced: "In order to consolidate the defense of Tianjin, landmines will be buried starting today within a radius of 100 meters from the outer moat, except for railways, highways, and bridges that can be used for traffic." A public notice was issued to the citizens, advising them to avoid entering the landmine area. The command stated that this measure is purely a necessary military preparation, and hoped that citizens would not speculate wildly about it, so as not to cause unrest.</p>
<h3>Supply Lifeline Destroyed, Bandits Will Not Be Difficult to Eradicate: Shi Jue Speaks After Visiting the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 7th] Chairman Chiang summoned Shi Jue, Commander of the Rehe-Suiyuan Pacification Zone, and Li Wen, Commander-in-Chief of the 34th Army Group, on the evening of the 6th. Shi stated on the 7th that the Chairman had given instructions on the current war situation, saying that the communist bandits will no longer be able to maintain any important strongholds within the Pass, as they have been forced to withdraw from Shaanxi, their political center, and have also been driven out of Shandong, their military center. After Yantai was recovered by the national army, all the arsenals in the Yimeng Mountain area, their supply lifeline, were destroyed, so the communist bandits will only have the option of roaming, and it will not be difficult to eradicate them. There is every confidence in the situation in Northeast China. The Chairman attaches great importance to the coordination between local military and political affairs, and said that in this difficult period, it would be foolish for military and political leaders to fail to cooperate closely. Shi also spoke about the situation in Rehe Province, saying that the attacks on western Liaoning are a result of the national army's withdrawal from eastern Rehe. After the national army captures Lingyuan, it will be able to recover Yebaishou and reopen the Jin-Cheng line. It is expected that the national army advancing eastward will not have to reach western Liaoning before the communist bandits collapse first. The clearing of western Liaoning is a matter of days.</p>
<h3>Navy Department Announces: Recovery of Liugong Island</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] News from the Navy Headquarters: Liugong Island, outside Weihaiwei, was indeed recovered by our navy at 8:30 AM on the 5th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Weihaiwei, 6th] The remnants of the bandits in the Weihaiwei urban area have been searched and cleared by a detachment of the navy. General Gui Yongqing led officers and soldiers on a patrol of the urban area on the morning of the 6th, and the citizens warmly welcomed them.</p>
<h3>US and British Consuls Arrive in Yantai to Investigate the Property of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yantai, 7th] Lee Cheng-mei, the US Vice Consul in Yantai, and Ike Ford, the acting British Consul General in Yantai, have arrived in Yantai from Qingdao. On the morning of the 7th, they called on Mayor Ding and began investigating the property of British and American overseas Chinese in Yantai.</p>
<h3>Southern Henan Recovers Gushi, Eastern Henan Enters Yanling</h3>
<p>[Our Hefei Office, 7th] The National Army in southern Henan recovered Gushi at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Office, 7th] Urgent report from the Field Headquarters: 500 bandits were discovered in Ta'ergang, northeast of Huangpo. It is generally believed that they are fleeing from the Huang'an area.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 7th] The communist bandits in Yanling were defeated and retreated to the southeast at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th, and the National Army immediately entered Yanling.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Instructs Beiping Women's Movement Work</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 7th] On the 7th, Madame Chiang summoned Guo Derun and Wang Aifen, representatives from the Beiping Women's Association, along with eight other individuals to provide instruction on the Beiping Women's Movement.</p>
<h3>Forgetting Not the National Day Amidst the Flames of War, Changchun Prepares to Hold Grand Commemorative Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Changchun Office, 7th] Despite the spread of war, all circles in Changchun have not forgotten the National Day. A decorated archway is being erected in Zhongshan Park, and it is planned to hold a grand commemorative meeting on Double Tenth. In addition to the parade, entertainment venues will offer preferential prices to citizens. Commodity prices in Changchun have risen over the past week. All circles of the military and political sectors have been holding meetings to discuss countermeasures. The police department has also reiterated that the ten martial law orders issued during the five communist offensives will remain in effect. Commodity prices have slightly decreased starting today.</p>
<h3>Tao Xisheng Speaks, Saying the Democratic League Is Propagandizing for the Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] On the evening of the 7th, a reporter interviewed Tao Xisheng, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, to ask for his opinion on Director Dong Xian-guang's remarks about the Democratic League. Tao replied: "Our opinion can be represented by the Central Daily News' editorial 'The Self-Determination of the Democratic League,' so there is no need to elaborate. I have another matter to report today. The publishing industry has been quite depressed recently, but the market is flooded with obscene books and communist propaganda books, both of which are poisons that paralyze the youth. The Xinzhi Bookstore and Reading Publishing House in Shanghai publish a particularly large number of communist propaganda books." Tao went on to cite facts to prove that these bookstores are publishing organizations that propagandize for the bandits on behalf of the Democratic League. (For details of Tao's remarks, see the second column of the second page)</p>
<h3>Chen Mingren Visits Minister Bai</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] General Chen Mingren, the famous defender of Siping and the current commander of the □ Army Group in Northeast China, visited Bai Chongxi at 4:00 PM on the 7th to report on the military situation. Bai praised Chen's courage and his brilliant achievements.</p>
<h3>Fu Zuoyi Flies to Shenyang to Discuss Joint Defense of Rehe and Northeast China</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 7th] Fu Zuoyi and seven staff members flew from Beiping to Shenyang at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 7th. Chen Cheng, Ma Zhanshan, Zheng Dongguo, Jin Zhen, and others were at the airport to welcome them. After getting off the plane, they rode with Chen Cheng to the First Guesthouse for discussions. It is generally believed that Fu and Chen discussed the joint defense of the corridor between Rehe and Northeast China, as well as the issue of Fu's troops entering the Pass to fight. However, Fu was very reserved, saying that this was his first time in Northeast China, and that he had no other task than to visit Chief Chen. He spoke tirelessly about general issues in Suiyuan and Ningxia. He emphasized the reliability of the people's power, saying that the traffic between Beiping and Baoding depends entirely on the people's protection for security, and that there is not a single soldier along the railway line. At a time when traffic in Northeast China has been completely destroyed by the communist bandits, Fu's earnest words are worthy of our people's consideration.</p>
<h3>Full-Scale War Breaks Out in Northeast China: Tieling and Yingkou Are Tense, Niuzhuang Falls, Siping Is Peaceful, Western Liaoning Recovers Suizhong</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Office, 7th] The development of the Northeast war situation will depend most on the outcome of the Battle of Tieling. The bandits are approaching the city with all their might. Xinmin, Yingkou, and Anshan are also extremely important, while the rest of the region is being targeted for disruption by the tactics of scattering and concentrating, and concentrating and scattering. The bandits are approaching Tieling from the north, west, and east in an encirclement. The first station north of Tieling, the Pingjiabao Station, was captured by the bandits at midnight on the 5th. The National Army has moved to the northern suburbs of Tieling, and fierce fighting is taking place in Majiazai, ten kilometers northeast of Tieling. The two sides are thirty to forty miles from the city. The air force has been dispatched to assist. Tieling is the northern gateway to Shenyang, and the bandits have increased their forces to 50,000 to 60,000. In the south, street fighting broke out in Yingkou on the night of the 7th, and Niuzhuang fell to the bandits on the afternoon of the 7th. The bandits attacked Lingshan, Shoushan, and Lishan, south of Liaoyang, again on the night of the 7th. In the west, Gongzhutun, 25 miles east of Xinmin, was captured on the 6th. Gaotaishan, eight kilometers north, which is a stronghold of the Julu River Railway Bridge, was captured by the bandits, but then recaptured by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Changchun Office, 7th] Fierce fighting is taking place in the southeast, west, and south of Siping. From Jinguozi, Mengniushao, to Shiling, elite troops of the National Army are using powerful firearms to kill the invading communist bandits. The situation in Siping is extremely peaceful. Guojiatun, between Siping and Gongzhuling, has been occupied by the bandits. The periphery of Changchun is calm. The communist bandits launched an attack from Xiaolong, but suffered heavy losses. The communist bandits on the Changjin Road are unable to dispatch small groups to harass Mengjiatun and other places. There are several thousand bandits in Danantun on the Changyi Road, most of whom are Korean communists.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 7th] After inflicting heavy casualties on the invading communist army on the evening of the 3rd, the defending forces of Gongzhuling transferred to another position according to plan.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Office, 7th] The National Army advancing north along the Beining Line is making rapid progress. Yesterday evening, Suizhong was recaptured and they are continuing to advance. They will be able to join forces with the National Army from Xingcheng in a few days. The communist bandits in that area have been routed. Approximately 70 kilometers of the railway have been destroyed, requiring 100,000 sleepers. More than 30 bridges have been damaged, and seven have already been repaired. Railway repairs have reached Qianwei.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 7th] Today, the Shenyang Garrison Command denied reports that Anshan had fallen. It is claimed that Anshan and other coal mining centers in Northeast China remain in the hands of the National Army.</p>
<h3>Political Affairs Meeting Revises and Approves Railway and Postal Subsidy Case; Postage for Regular Mail Will Increase to 1,500 Yuan</h3>

The railway portion is subsidized at 11.2 billion yuan per month, and the highway portion is subsidized at 2 billion yuan per month. It will be implemented after it is approved by the State Council. The postal portion is calculated at a postage fee of 1,500 yuan per regular letter, with a monthly subsidy of 2.8 billion yuan. After discussion, it was initially decided to submit it to the State Council for approval, and then to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei told reporters in the evening that the amount of the subsidy was estimated based on the current cost of negotiated coal. If the price of coal rises, the amount will naturally increase, because the expenses of the transportation industry are mainly for salaries and coal prices, so although the amount has been approved, the Ministry of Transportation still needs to calculate it in detail before submitting it to the State Council.</p>

<h3>Smugglers Use All Sorts of Methods: Opium Hidden in Sneaker Soles; More Than Twenty Smuggling Cases Are Tried Daily in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[United Press, Hong Kong, 7th] Chief Seismograph of the Import and Export Bureau said today. Smugglers use all sorts of methods to smuggle goods from Hong Kong to all parts of China. The inspection authorities work seven days a week, and are busy at night, making it difficult to prevent. Even the bottom layer of sports shoes can be used to hide opium, and the abuses are even greater with boats, vehicles and airplanes.</p>
<h3>Confiscated Smuggled Goods This Year Are Worth Approximately HK$2 Million</h3>
<p>From January 1 to September 1 this year, the total value of confiscated smuggled goods was approximately HK$2 million, weighing approximately 20 tons. Most of it was manufactured abroad, 60% was American goods. The warehouse is piled with a large number of sundries such as leather shoes, toothpaste, bicycles, canned food, oranges, glass products, toys, cold cream, biscuits, and chemicals. Most of the alcohol comes from Vietnam, mostly brandy, which is commonly drunk by Chinese. Scottish whiskey is rarely found because only Americans like it. When smuggled goods are seized, the owners often avoid applying, making it difficult to seize both the person and the goods. An average of more than 20 smuggling cases are tried every day, and most have already been convicted.</p>
<h3>Fruit and Penicillin Are Donated to Charitable Organizations</h3>
<p>The handling of smuggled goods varies depending on the circumstances. Fresh fruits and perishable items such as penicillin are donated to charitable organizations and hospitals. Patented products are sold on the market, and useful goods such as bicycles are kept by the government. Alcoholic beverages are first tested by experts, and those that are legal are also sold to the market, while those that are illegal are all poured into the sea.</p>
<h3>Control Yuan Monthly Meeting: Li Shijun Reports on Inspection Impressions, Many Talented Personnel in Agencies, But Insufficient</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The Control Yuan held its monthly meeting on the morning of the 7th, presided over by Yuan Chief Yu. Supervisor Li Shijun reported on the inspection of the implementation of policies in various agencies in the capital, and his impressions. The summary of impressions of the general agencies is as follows: The administration of central agencies should pay more attention to the expression of policies and the proactive leadership. Administrative agencies are complex, with unclear powers and responsibilities, reducing efficiency. Most agencies have too many personnel, and some lack talent. The personnel system still lacks uniformity and soundness. The hiring procedures of agencies and state-run enterprises under the Ministry of Finance are mostly non-compliant. Senior personnel hold too many concurrent positions, especially in the Ministries of Finance and Agriculture. Misappropriation of budget items is almost a universal phenomenon, and business expenses are not submitted for review. Transaction management needs to be effectively improved, especially warehouse management. The impressions of the inspection of financial institutions are that the unrestricted industrial and commercial loan policy in the past has aggravated the fluctuations in the financial market and the skyrocketing prices. In addition, the Ministry of Finance should correct smuggling and tax evasion, and the misconduct of financial personnel. It is also heard that after this inspection, Li has submitted a proposal and an impeachment letter.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Investment Capital Flows to Wuhan and Guangzhou: 15-16 Billion in One Day; Guangdong Military and Political Authorities Discuss Stabilizing Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 7th] Investment capital from Shanghai has been flowing south in a surge recently. According to information received, the Central Bank here received between seventy and eighty remittances from other locations to Guangzhou in one day. Each remittance was in excess of 200 million yuan, with the total reaching 15-16 billion yuan. Currently, Shanghai is restricting the outflow of funds to the south, so most of it is being transferred to Guangzhou via Hankou. As a result, the national currency has increased daily, and the Hong Kong dollar has skyrocketed. On the 6th, the highest exchange rate jumped to 14,400 yuan, and general prices have also risen sharply, causing ordinary people to cry out in misery. Chairman Song of the Provincial Government has been devising new countermeasures with the Department of Finance and the banking industry for days, and has also sent personnel to secretly investigate whether there are other major causes. He has also consulted thoroughly with Director Zhang Kuikui to formulate effective measures to stabilize prices and has resolved to punish those who maliciously disrupt the financial system.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Reemergence of the Communist International</h3>
<p>We have learned from news from Europe that the Communist International has once again publicly appeared on the international political stage. We are not surprised by this news. In May 1943, when Moscow announced the dissolution of the Communist International, we already felt that the Soviet Union would not easily abandon this tool that had always been at Moscow's disposal. It was only because at that time it was necessary to please Western democracies, especially to obtain a large amount of Lend-Lease Act materials from the United States, that it announced the dissolution of the Communist International, which had been established in the Lenin era, with a simple announcement. In the minds of discerning people, they all understand that the announcement of the dissolution of the Communist International is nothing more than a trick played by Moscow. The international communist movement and the world revolution movement will not be affected by the dissolution of the Communist International. The reappearance of the Communist International this time is just choosing a time that they consider most appropriate to re-announce the public appearance of this international organization, as if they were playing behind the scenes before, and now they are openly taking the stage. It is no more surprising than the fact that the Chinese Communist Party seemed willing to cooperate with the National Government during the Anti-Japanese War, but one day after the victory, it openly rebelled.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the reappearance of the Communist International this time is a direct response to the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. According to reports, the new Communist International declaration issued in the capital of Romania, with the Communist Parties of nine European countries led by the Soviet Union, is tantamount to declaring war on the whole world; and this war is not only limited to ideology, but also extends to politics and even economics, and is a declaration of a comprehensive war, using the power of the working class to fight against what they call "enslaving Europe" "Imperialism." Therefore, the reappearance of the Communist International this time is to re-raise the banner of "anti-imperialist" war, and its main purpose is to attack the United States. We are also not surprised by this posture. Since its establishment in Moscow in 1919, the Communist International has consistently made it its mission to carry out the will of the Kremlin. Before Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, the Kremlin never stopped cursing countries such as Britain and the United States as imperialists. As long as the Kremlin decides how to be most beneficial to the Soviet Union, the Communist International will faithfully carry it out. From 1919 to 1926, the Communist International, led by Zinoviev, advocated world revolution, but in 1928 it became the Communist International that supported the establishment of the Soviet Union, the so-called "socialism in one country." In order to cooperate with the Soviet Union's foreign policy at the time, the Communist International also attempted to get along with the world outside the Soviet Union in a peaceful environment. In 1935, when the Soviet Union's foreign policy changed, the Communist International launched the so-called "People's Front" movement everywhere, attempting to infiltrate it. The subsequent dissolution and today's reappearance are also reflections of the Soviet Union's foreign policy, which goes without saying. So the so-called Communist International is just a tool of the Kremlin!</p>
<p>Speaking of "anti-imperialism," this is something that we Chinese should especially point out. Because today's remnants of imperialism in China, such as unequal treaties, leased territories, and the use of military ports by foreign countries, have mostly disappeared with the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. And at this moment, the "privileges" taken from China during the Tsarist era have now been inherited by the Soviet Union, which is singing the praises of "anti-imperialism," but these "privileges" were originally automatically abandoned by the Soviet Union during the Lenin era. Then the so-called "imperialism" should have a deeper understanding in the minds of the Chinese people today. Then, how should the Chinese people know what to do with the comprehensive "anti-imperialist" war announced by the Communist International this time?</p>
<p>Based on this point of view, the Chinese people have no choice but to stand on a neutral position. Due to the reappearance of the Communist International this time, the division of the world into two camps, the banners are more distinct, and the struggle will become more intense. This is really unfortunate in today's world after the Second World War! But since the situation is like this, if we continue to adopt a perfunctory policy at this time, I am afraid that there will be a second Munich. Therefore, we must not take appeasement measures to increase the arrogance of one party. To criticize and examine its intentions, it seems that it also wants to advocate another "Political Consultative Conference" in the international arena, so that one party can lay down its arms and become the "obedient people" of the other party, in order to revive the "brotherhood" of the "boss" and "second child." If what they say is true, it seems that all the blame in the world should be attributed to the United States "boss," which is helping other countries with post-war reconstruction; isn't this a bit too subjective? We are not saying that everything the United States does is right, but we absolutely disagree with another appeasement like the Chamberlain era in today's world.</p>
<p>The reappearance of the Communist International this time will undoubtedly affect the current situation in China. China, which is based on the Three Principles of the People, is inherently incompatible with communism. Our nationalism and the national politics we advocate are essentially incompatible with the communist totalitarian system centered on the dictatorship of the proletariat. No matter how the international situation changes, we should redouble our efforts to complete the suppression of the rebellion. We hope that the people of the whole country will bear in mind the slogan that "communists have no motherland," and for the sake of our motherland, we will redouble our efforts to complete our mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country as soon as possible!</p>

<h3>Several Political Figures in Beijing Comment on the Communist International</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) Shao Lizhi stated that he did not want to express any opinions on this matter, but said that some people believe that this is the revival of the Third International, which is actually a mistake, because the Third International has long been abolished. If you want to give it a new term, you can call it the "Fourth International," and this organization is biased towards Europe and has no major relationship with us. We don't have to consider the path of being pro-Soviet. Yu Jiaju, a member of the Youth Party Government Committee, said that the sharpening of the opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union is indeed a "deterioration" of the current world political trend. In this situation, we can only strengthen unity, clarify officialdom, and engage in construction. Regardless of diplomacy or internal affairs, we should seek independence and autonomy, so as to avoid being involved in this vortex. Some people advocate being pro-Soviet in our future diplomatic front, but we should consider the following four conditions: the return of Lushun and Dalian to our country, whether the Soviet Union can help us solve the CCP problem, whether the Soviet Union can help us build, and whether the Soviet Union can help us resolve the Xinjiang dispute? At the same time, we should especially study under what circumstances the Soviet Union can be friendly to us. Yu believes that the following four conditions must be met: the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, China's abandonment of U.S. economic assistance, the Chinese government and the public should have goodwill propaganda towards the Soviet Union, and Chinese materials should assist the Soviet Union's construction. Weighing the pros and cons of the above two considerations, whether we can be pro-Soviet or not can be concluded. Chen Lifu, Minister of the Organization Department, said that this matter is not surprising, because the Communist International has already been abolished, but its work has not stopped. This is just a restoration in name only. Several problems in the world are due to strict barriers and failure to coordinate. I sincerely hope that they will tolerate each other and focus on the happiness of all mankind in the world. Wu Zhaoxu, a senator, said that there is no difference between the Communist International and the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union abolished the Third International in 1943, it was out of fear that the United States would have concerns about the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Cheng Cangbo, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, said that the joint organization of the nine countries in Eastern Europe has two meanings: one is a political offensive against the United States. The United Nations General Assembly is currently being held, and Soviet representative Vyshinsky strongly criticized the United States at the General Assembly. The declaration of the Communist Parties of the nine countries was issued at this time to strengthen the voice of the Soviet representative and imply that the Soviet Union may withdraw from the UN General Assembly if necessary; the other is an economic offensive against the United States. Almost all those who participate in this organization are Eastern European countries. After the Marshall Plan for European economic assistance was announced, the Soviet Union used the Molotov Plan to confront it. This cooperation between the nine countries is an expression of the Eastern European group resisting the United States and the Western European group in economic terms. Tao also said that although this matter happened in Eastern Europe and is aimed at the United States, its impact will never be limited to Eastern Europe, and the whole world will be affected.</p>
<h3>Tao Xisheng Talks About the Content</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) I would like to point out a clear fact today, that is, the "A Brief History of China" edited by Fan Wenlan is published by Xinzhi Bookstore. When the CCP headquarters was still in Yan'an, it established a fake Central Research Institute, with Fan Wenlan as the director. Wang Shiwei, a researcher at the institute, wrote an article "Wild Lily," criticizing the Communist Party for lacking humanity. He was severely reviewed by the institute. The "Liberation Daily" in Yan'an on June 28 and 29, 30, carried Fan Wenlan's description of the review process of the fake Central Research Institute, which can be used as a reference. As a result of the review, Wang Shiwei was cruelly punished by the Communist bandits. The fake Central Research Institute and Fan Wenlan's popularity were triggered by this incident. In the name of the Chinese History Research Association, the institute compiled the book "A Brief History of China" in 30 years of the Republic of China, which was published by Xinhua Bookstore in Yan'an. The "Liberation Daily" in Yan'an on December 13 and 14, 30, carried the writing process of the book, and the "Liberation Daily" published an "Advertisement of Xinhua Bookstore in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region," which ranked the advertisement of the book first. (For example, the "Liberation Daily" on April 3, 32, had this advertisement) When Yan'an was recovered by the National Army, the book was reprinted by Shanghai Xinzhi Bookstore. This incident can prove that the publishing business of the Democratic League is just propaganda work for the Communist bandits. The books published by the two bookstores are largely used as a guide for the bandits to launch riots, seize territories, split the territory, and betray the country. Its historical works also seduce young people, despise Chinese history, hate Chinese culture, hurt national self-confidence and self-esteem, and create materials for the Communist bandits to betray the motherland. I would like to call the attention of the academic and cultural circles.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Huainan coal is the main source of coal for railways such as Zhupu and public utilities in the capital, such as railways and ships.

Since January, air transport has been interrupted, and tens of thousands of spirits are waiting to die. The Hebei Provisional Senate has telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the central government and other relevant agencies, calling for a quick resumption of air transport to save the dying military and civilians.</p>

<h3>Full Report of the Supervisory Yuan</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday's fifth edition) (F) Investigation of the situation of major import and export trading companies</p>
<p>China Fuzhong Industrial Corporation: This company was jointly organized in the 35th year of the Republic of China by the Bank of Communications, China National Goods Bank, and Jin Cheng Bank. The total capital of the company is 300 million yuan in national currency, divided into 30,000 shares, each share being 10,000 yuan. The Bank of Communications invested 100 million yuan, the China National Goods Bank invested 150 million yuan, and the Jin Cheng Bank invested 50 million yuan. The shareholders of the Bank of Communications were represented by Qian Xinzhi and five others, the China National Goods Bank was represented by Kong Yongzhi and eight others, and the Jin Cheng Bank was represented by Zhou Zuomin and four others. Qian Xinzhi was the chairman of the board, Song Ziliang was the general manager, and Shen Henian and Lu Pinqin were assistant managers. The head office was located in Shanghai, with a branch office in New York. Its business was import and export trade, exclusively managing the goods of American manufacturers, including 12 companies such as Willis Motors and Westinghouse Electric. The company's foreign exchange settlement situation, as of now, has been approved for a total of US$1,585,086.09, with US$137,817.43 of its own foreign exchange. More than 50% was used to purchase cars, 20% was used to purchase wireless communication equipment, and the rest was approved for importing materials. Regarding the company's purchase of automobiles, it was found that it purchased a total of 780 Jeep cars, 101 touring cars, and 2 Cadillac-brand cars. In addition to the Cadillac factory price exceeding the prescribed amount, the Jeep cars were listed under item 25630 of the import tariff, as light-duty trucks under one metric ton. According to regulations, starting from April 29, 1946, their import should have been temporarily suspended. However, the company imported a total of 745 vehicles after May 1946. According to the customs declaration endorsements, a total of 189 vehicles were imported on May 1, May 23, and June 2, which were already en route before April 29. Furthermore, from May 23, 1946, to January 28, 1947, 549 vehicles were imported, which were already purchased before April 29, with cash or letters of credit used to settle the purchase price, and approved for import by the customs in accordance with regulations. After reviewing the documents, they were found to be consistent. However, upon reviewing the company's foreign exchange settlement books, only two orders for 200 Jeep cars were placed on April 10 and April 24, 1946, with a total deposit of US$49,000.00. The remaining US$767,240.00 for Jeep cars was settled after April 29, and more than half were settled successively after August. As for the 101 touring cars, they were permitted to be imported after customs declaration and inspection, based on the government-issued permits MC11-49 and MC11-101, and there were no discrepancies. Furthermore, upon investigating the company's business operations, what warrants attention is the relationship between the head office and the New York branch. According to the company's assistant manager, Lu Pinqin, Fachung Hnternationol Corporation in New York is a branch of Fuzhong Industrial Co., Ltd. The contract to sell Willis cars was also signed by the Shanghai head office, but in reality, the import of Willis cars was negotiated by the New York branch. The head office treated the cars as consigned goods, and all expenses related to foreign exchange settlement, customs declaration, and transportation were recorded in the New York branch's current account. The branch only paid a 15% commission to the head office. All business and financial matters of the branch were never reported to the head office. This situation may lead to the following malpractices: 1. Concealing profits and evading national taxes; 2. Obscuring the true situation of business operations; 3. Without reporting or regular auditing of the branch's business in New York, it is impossible to know whether it is absorbing overseas remittances (see Attachment 13 for details).</p>
<p>Yangtze Construction Corporation: This company was registered and established in April 1946, with a capital of 100 million yuan in national currency. In July 1947, the capital was increased to 1 billion yuan, divided into 1 million shares. Kong Lingkan held 249,000 shares, Du Yuesheng held 7,000 shares, Fan Shaozeng and two others each held 6,000 shares, Zhao Jiyan and two others each held 90,000 shares, Gu Xinyi and four others each held 50,000 shares, Yao Wenkai held 48,000 shares, and Luo Qinghua and one other each held 4,000 shares. Kong Lingkan was the chairman of the board and general manager. There are nine departments, including industry, business, affairs, finance, agency, import, export, pigments, and film, as well as five branch offices in Hankou, Fuzhou, Nanjing, Hong Kong, and Tianjin. Its business scope includes industrial development, transportation, warehousing, insurance, real estate, domestic and foreign product sales, and industrial and commercial investment. An examination of its business operations reveals the following: 1. Regarding the use of foreign exchange, a total of US$1,820,411.03, £21,041, and 45,333.00 Swiss francs have been settled. There is also unsettled foreign exchange, including US$903,684.72 and £1,386. For export goods, a total of US$954,889.61, £95,562, and 266,035 Swiss francs have been settled. 2. The imported goods are mainly cotton and medicines. For automobiles, 50 Austin cars were purchased, which did not exceed the prescribed amount, and 182 boxes of cosmetics were imported successively under permit number MC22-28, with a total value of US$10,403.49. Among them, two boxes contained perfumes, powders, and other luxury goods, which were prohibited from being imported and were verified by customs and ordered to be returned, and were not allowed to be imported. 3. The company has 20 exclusive agency agreements with British and American manufacturers, the most of which are for medicines. 4. In addition to this company, there is also the American Yangtze Trading Corporation (Yangtze Lauding Corporation New York U.S.A.). According to its statement, it is only for business liaison and mutual sales of goods. Its organization and capital are independent and unrelated. The American Yangtze Trading Corporation entrusts the company to sell goods on its behalf, handles all procedures on its behalf, and charges a commission of 5% of the sales amount. If a transaction exceeds US$50,000, the commission is calculated at 2.5%. The same applies to the company's export goods entrusted to the American Yangtze Trading Corporation. However, the American Yangtze Trading Corporation's consignment goods are all applying for foreign exchange in the company's name. However, the above relationship does not have a formal contract (see Attachment 14 for details).</p>
<p>China Construction Bank: This company was founded in 1934 with a total capital of 10 million yuan in national currency, divided into 1 million shares. The majority of shareholders are local banks and leading bankers in Shanghai, totaling more than 80 shareholders. Those with more shares include Wu Weiqing (176,000 shares), Jia Yuesen and Li Ziming (30,000 shares each), Xi Demao (31,000 shares), Xu Keting, Kong Yuenzhi, and Ye Zhuotang (20,000 shares each), Song Ziwen, Zhang Renjie, Chen Qikang, and Bei Zuyi (25,000 shares each), Li Shufen (53,000 shares), and Song Zian (35,000 shares). Kong Xiangxi was the chairman of the board, and Song Zian was the general manager. Its affiliated units include four companies: Huainan Mining Railway, Yangtze Electric, Hanzhen Jiji Hydroelectric, and Sino-American Rubber. An examination of the company's situation reveals the following facts: 1. The company's foreign exchange settlement amounted to only US$877.62, used to purchase typewriters and miscellaneous stationery. 2. The company imported a total of 56 cars of various brands, with its own foreign exchange, and the factory prices did not exceed the regulations. 3. According to the company's report, the net loss for this period was 142,701,782.00 yuan in national currency. 4. Song Ziwen's share capital in the company only accounts for 250,000 yuan in national currency, accounting for one-fortieth of the total capital (see Attachment 15 for details).</p>
<p>China Vegetable Oil Factory: This factory was initiated and organized by the former Ministry of Industry in 1936, with a capital of 2 million yuan, subscribed by the Ministry of Industry and the governments of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces respectively, and it was decided to raise half of the capital from commercial shares. At the second shareholders' meeting in 1947, the capital was increased to 2 billion yuan in national currency. In addition to the old shareholders subscribing for 1.6 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications and the Farmers Bank each subscribed for 120 million yuan, and the remaining 160 million yuan was subscribed by the factory's employees. Government shares accounted for 58%, and commercial shares accounted for 42%. The chairman of the board was Zhou Yichun, and the general manager was Zhang Jiazhu. The main business is the export of tung oil and the extraction of edible oil. An examination of its business operations reveals the following: 1. Regarding loans, since the end of the war, the factory has transported and sold approximately 40,000 tons of tung oil and extracted over 10,000 tons of oil. Due to insufficient self-funding to support the turnover, after being ordered to increase capital to produce edible oil and stabilize commodity prices, it applied for loans from the Four Banks Joint Treasury. A total of 30.1 billion yuan has been approved and is being used, divided into tung oil loans of 22.5 billion yuan, edible oil production of 8.6 billion yuan, increased production and pre-purchase of peanut raw material loans of 18 billion yuan, and government pre-allocated subsidy for food oil sales to government and education employees of 1 billion yuan. 2. Regarding export foreign exchange settlement, the factory mainly exports tung oil. From January 1, 1946, to the end of August 1947, the export foreign exchange settlement was equivalent to US$30,038,504.01. The imports were all production equipment, such as oil tanks, oil barges, and cotton ginning equipment, totaling US$470,371.00, which is consistent with the numbers listed by the Central Bank. 3. Regarding the sale of edible oil, in order to cooperate with the emergency economic measures plan to stabilize oil prices, the factory jointly sold edible oil to retailers with the China Food Oil Company. In April of this year, oil prices fluctuated greatly. The Shanghai Municipal Government convened a meeting of representatives from various oil industries and decided to allocate 13,483.41 municipal dan of edible oil from the China Food Oil Company to the factory, of which 9,655 municipal dan were offered for sale at prices discussed by the municipal government to stabilize oil prices. These sales all had settlement receipts from each purchaser, and the sales prices were determined by the Shanghai Municipal Government (see Attachment 16 for details).</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York, 7th Broadcast: Lake Success News, according to sources close to the US delegation, the United States has finally decided to submit the Korean issue to the United Nations General Assembly, approximately within this week. The United States will propose the establishment of an independent Korean government under the supervision of the United Nations in the coming months, with the aim of breaking the deadlock between the US and the Soviet Union on the Korean issue. The United States hopes that when the US and Soviet troops withdraw simultaneously, Korea itself and the United Nations will be responsible for maintaining order and supervising elections in the north, south, east and west of Korea to ensure they are absolutely free and democratic. US officials hope that the elections can be held within the next six months. As for the troop withdrawal issue, it should be discussed by Korea, the Soviet Union and the United States to determine a date. In this way, Korea's future will not depend on the four powers, but can be guided by the United Nations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 6th] It was learned from reliable sources today that before the United States submits any concrete proposals on the Korean issue to the General Assembly, it will first consult with the Chinese and British delegations.

<h3>UN Committee Debates Greek Issue, Soviet Union Rejects US Compromise Plan, Demands Foreign Troops Withdraw from Greece</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 6th] The United States previously proposed a compromise plan on the Balkans issue at the UN General Assembly, namely, if Greece's three northern neighbors and other United Nations countries agree to cooperate with the proposed Balkan border survey team, the United States is willing to abandon the accusations of the three countries. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky rejected the compromise plan of the United States on the 6th and further accused the United States of completely destroying Greek independence and turning Greece into a US military base.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 6th] Soviet representative Gromyko said in a speech at the UN Political Committee that Greece should be held fully responsible for the Balkan turmoil and demanded that foreign troops withdraw from Greece immediately. He said that after careful study of all the documents of the Balkan Investigation Committee, the Soviet delegation came to the following conclusions: (1) The facts prove that the accusations against the three countries of Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria are completely unfair and based on fabrications; (2) The facts prove that all guilt should be borne by the Greek government; (3) The government that engages in interference in Greece, supports anti-democratic and reactionary forces, and attempts to use the situation to achieve its own expansionist goals cannot shirk its responsibility; (4) The Soviet delegation cannot accept the US proposal to establish a new Balkan border monitoring committee because the proposal is based on false information. Gromyko said that if this resolution is adopted, it will be a new obstacle to promoting international peace and security. The Soviet Union believes that the only proper way to resolve the Greek issue is: First, immediately withdraw foreign troops and foreign experts stationed in Greece; Second, give the Greek people a real opportunity to resolve their own problems based on democratic principles.</p>
<h3>Female Corpse Gives Birth to Infant</h3>

<h3>Discussions on the Disposition of Italian Colonies Encountered Obstacles at the Four-Power Conference; No Agreement Reached on the Qualification of Participating Countries</h3>
<p>[United Press London 7th dispatch] The four-power foreign ministers' representatives encountered their first obstacle on Monday when discussing the future of the Italian colonies in Africa. The United States and the Soviet Union clashed on the number of countries with the right to attend and present their cases on this issue. The United States argued that only Allied countries that fought in North Africa and countries that demanded a share of Italian territory should be allowed to attend and present their cases. However, the Soviet representative, Mr. Tzarapkin, insisted that all 17 countries that signed the peace treaty with Italy, as well as countries that demanded Italian territory, should be allowed to attend and present their cases. The meeting adjourned without any results. However, the US representative, Mr. Koorman, promised to forward the Soviet proposal to the State Department for further consideration.</p>
<p>It is reported that the United States indicated last year that the Soviet proposal would place countries such as Ukraine and Yugoslavia on the same footing as Great Britain and its self-governing dominions, which had shed blood and made great contributions in the North African war, which the United States found difficult to accept. French Deputy Foreign Minister Massigli accepted the Soviet definition of "concerned countries" on the 6th, meaning that this term refers to countries that should participate in the conference to resolve the colonial issue under the provisions of the peace treaty with Italy. The British representative, Mr. Charles, put forward a third suggestion that the four powers decide on a deadline for each country to submit its opinions. However, the British explanation was to enable the Arab League countries to express their opinions. A spokesperson for the League has expressed the hope to express opinions on the proposal for Libya's independence. All four deputy foreign ministers agreed that Egypt and Abyssinia, having claimed Italian territory, should have the right to attend. The list of countries that the United States proposed to have the right to attend included Australia, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Abyssinia, Greece, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Poland, and South Africa, whose troops had fought in Africa. The Soviet list would add Ukraine, Belarus, Yugoslavia, China, Canada, Brazil, and the Netherlands, as these countries also signed the peace treaty with Italy. US sources reported that Tzarapkin said that if the Soviet interpretation was accepted, the Soviet Union would oppose Pakistan's participation, as it was established after the signing of the treaty.</p>

<h3>Yu Zhengxun Summons Yu Xiaosheng; Wu Ping Denies Soliciting American Dollars; Ma Lai Accuses Que Li of Murder; Que Li Sits Aside Smiling, Saying Ma Is All Lies</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Que Li Aque, the English suspect in the Yu Shengxiao murder case, was tried for the third time at the Criminal Court No. 1 of the District Court at 1:30 pm yesterday. Judge Zhu Yuhuang and Prosecutor Ding Tongjun took their seats. After first questioning Que Li's name, age, nationality, occupation, etc., they ordered him to sit aside. Next, the coffee shop manager of the Bersillon Coffee Shop, Yan Guizhen, a short waiter, was summoned. Yan claimed to be from Ninghai, Zhejiang, residing at No. 1, Alley 85, Albert Road, and working as a waiter at Bersillon for one year and eight months. Most of the customers in the bar were foreigners, and Ma Lai was also a frequent guest. When asked if he knew Que Li, he said he did not. Yan continued, "A young girl accompanied Ma Lai four or five times. On August 1st, a foreigner came to the coffee shop at around 3 or 4 pm and left a note, asking me to give it to Ma Lai. At around 7 or 8 pm, Ma Lai came alone, and I gave him the note. After reading it, he tore it up and said he understood. Then he sat for about an hour before leaving." Then, Wu Ping (pictured), one of the "sister flowers" on the photo obtained from Ma Lai's place, a bar girl, was summoned to testify. Her sister, Wu Zhen, did not attend due to illness. Wu Ping was wearing a light blue cheongsam, a bright red long-sleeved velvet shirt, light makeup, sunglasses, and light yellow leather shoes. She was quite short. When she appeared in court, she was still chewing Wrigley's Spearmint gum and said, "I am from Shanghai, 19 years old. I met Ma Lai in July of this year. We often went to Bersillon, so we got to know each other. We met a total of five or six times." Judge Song asked, "What did you talk about when you met?" Wu replied, "The second time we met, Ma Lai said he wanted to marry me, but it was just a joke." Asked, "How did it start?" She answered, "During small talk, he said he was a short guy. I am also a short girl, everyone is short, let's get married, after this he did not mention it again, I also did not say to him that only with money can we get married. The last time I met him was on August 2nd, he said that on the 4th he would be going to Nanjing, and asked me to go eat on the 3rd. After that, he sat with another woman named Gao Meiying for two hours before leaving." Asked when and where she gave the photo to Ma Lai, Wu said that it was during the third time she met Ma, she showed it to him at Bersillon, he looked at it but did not return it. Questioned if she asked Ma for US$1,000 in order to get married, Wu said hastily, "No, no, it was Gao Meiying talking nonsense."</p>
<p>Ma Lai's friend Wu Ping, who was supposed to testify, was questioned by the defendant's defense lawyer (photo by this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Ma Lai's Account of the Bloody Incident</h3>
<p>Reading the record up to this point, the court summoned Ma Lai, who was escorted by two American military police officers to the witness stand. After swearing an oath, he testified: "I came to Shanghai twice in May of this year, and on July 17th I was assigned to the Kyoto Hospital Station, and returned to Shanghai on the morning of August 1st at 10:30 am." Asked if he had spoken with a Luo Se in Kyoto about getting married in Shanghai, Ma replied, "Perhaps I said it." Then he described the situation on August 1st, saying, "I reported to the hospital in Shanghai in the morning, and someone there told me that someone had called several times looking for me, but had not left a name. At 2:30 pm I went to the New Lido bar and met Que Li, who said he had been looking for me all day. I asked him when he would return my money, and he said he had no money, only some property in Hongqiao, which he was preparing to sell to a Chinese person, asking me to be a middleman, and I could get a commission. At 3:30 pm I sat in his car to the Broadway Mansion, where I changed into plain clothes. After drinking some coffee, he gave me a brown felt hat. He drove the car, and I sat in the back, driving along the Bund. Yu Shengxiao got into the car here. Que Li introduced me to him, and then we drove along Linsen Middle Road towards Hongqiao. When we got to Qingpu Road, Que Li suddenly stopped the car, holding a gun and turning around, he told Yu to give him the gold bars. Yu just threw the gold bars towards the front seat when suddenly a gunshot was heard, and Yu fell on me. I pushed him back, and Que Li asked me to lie down", and then he used the gun handle to hit Yu's head. He continued to drive for a while, then stopped the car again and ordered me to drag Yu out, which I did. The car turned east. I asked Que to give me the handgun, and Que did so. After entering the city, I asked him why he did this, but he did not answer. I washed my hands in his bathroom and wiped the blood stains off my clothes and pants. Then we went to the racetrack together. He got out of the car, and I found a bullet cartridge on the left side of the front seat of the car. After that, we went to the Huizhong Hotel for a drink, and he sent me back to the Broadway Mansion to sleep. The next morning, he called me to the New Lido for a meal, but when I got there, he was not there. At 5 pm, I went to his house, and he was not there either. After a while he came, and later I asked him why he did this, and I was ready to turn myself in, and he blamed me for being wrong. I said that as long as you return my money, I don't care about anything else. Then he gave me US$110 and said he was willing to give me a gold bar, but I said no. I only left his house at around 6 pm."</p>
<h3>Questioning the Details of the Shooting</h3>
<p>After Ma Lai finished his testimony, Judge Zhu asked again how many times the gun went off and whether the car stopped after the shot. Ma replied that the gun went off once and the car stopped. Asked which hand Que Li held the gun with, Ma said he could not be sure. Asked again, "When Que Li turned around, was his head turned to the left or right?" He replied, "Turned to the left." Asked, "How did Yu Shengxiao lie down?" He replied, "He slowly slid down, as if he was very tired, sitting. Que Li then got up and raised the gun and struck Yu's head heavily. Yu shouted, 'Don't kill me, I want to live.' Que Li asked me to drag Yu out of the car, and I dared not disobey." Asked, "What did you and Que Li say on the way back?" He replied, "I asked him why he did this, and he said that he was used to doing this when he was in the patrol room." Subsequently, he did not deny that he had taken Gao Meiying to the Broadway overnight on the night of August 1st, but said that he had not told Gao that he was going to marry Wu Ping.</p>
<h3>Que Li Smiles and Remains Calm</h3>
<p>Finally, Que Li was asked again if he had heard Ma Lai's statement clearly and if he had any comments. Que Li remained calm and smiled, saying, "I heard it clearly, but most of what he said is a lie. I have nothing else to say today, I can only say that everything I said before is the truth." The court ordered Que Li to ask Ma Lai questions, but Que Li was unwilling, saying, "Please let my lawyer represent me." The defendant's defense attorney, Tang Huaiqun, represented Que Li and asked Ma Lai, "You said you did not want Wu Ping to marry you, so it seems that Wu Ping wanted to marry you, you are a handsome man, she had to marry you?" Ma replied, "Maybe it's possible, this is also very common." The court ordered that the case be adjourned for another hearing, which was already at 5 pm.</p>

Commander Xuan told a Central News Agency reporter, "People from all walks of life have gatherings during the Mid-Autumn Festival, but soldiers spend the festival in vain due to their duties. This meeting is to take advantage of the free time to allow all military and police personnel in Shanghai to have a gathering." At the beginning of the banquet, Xuan delivered a speech saying, "Everyone present is directly or indirectly responsible for the task of protecting Shanghai. This task is arduous and not easy to accomplish. Shanghai is the industrial and commercial center of the country, the lifeline of the economy. In terms of national defense, it is the outpost of coastal defense, so Shanghai must be consolidated and stable. For the past two years, everyone has worked hard in their duties. Although it is not entirely in line with ideals, it is still comforting to the central and local people." Xuan continued, "The overall situation is becoming more and more serious, and the responsibility of the control class is even heavier. We are not afraid of facing great difficulties because we are all alert and deeply believe that we have the strength to overcome all difficulties. Soldiers have been in a passive position in the past, but the founding father once told us: 'Military affairs are the original driving force of politics.' The reason for the slow progress of politics is that soldiers have not fulfilled their responsibilities. Therefore, today's vigilant soldiers should change from being passive to taking the initiative and truly become the original driving force of politics. Everyone at today's meeting should be vigilant about the current situation so that the communists can be wiped out as soon as possible and the country can be built soon," Shao Baichang, Commander of the Fortress, delivered a speech, followed by entertainment programs. The banquet proceeded in a pleasant atmosphere and ended at 2 pm.</p>

<h3>### Social Relief Association – Suggests Implementing Work Relief Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] According to relevant sources, the number of refugees fleeing to Shanghai from disaster-stricken and war-torn areas in Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu provinces has already reached over 200,000, and large numbers are still arriving in an endless stream. Most of the refugees who have arrived in Shanghai have become beggars, begging for food during the day and sleeping on the streets at night; even those who are young and strong find it difficult to find work. How to carefully consider their needs, find ways to provide relief and resettlement, all depends on the government and people's organizations to establish practical connections, work together, actively mobilize local forces, and pre-plan for winter relief, so that disaster victims can temporarily obtain warmth and sustenance. At the same time, it is also necessary to appeal to the government to exert great effort and implement work relief measures, so that millions of disaster victims with the ability to work can make a living through their own labor, thereby ensuring the proper maintenance of social tranquility and order in this city. Yesterday, our reporter made a special visit to the Shanghai Social Relief Association to inquire about their opinions on work relief. Mr. Zhou Yingshi briefly answered as follows: Mr. Zhou said that regarding the implementation of work relief measures, in addition to referring to the government's post-disaster relief work relief implementation plan, the following matters should be noted:</p>
<p>The operating agency shall be the Shanghai Winter Relief Committee, which will invite the Public Works Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, the Municipal Council, and other relevant parties to form a "Work Relief Group" to be responsible for implementation. Matters such as surveying, designing, approving, training, and supervising work relief projects shall be handled by the Public Works Bureau in consultation with the Executive Yuan Relief Administration. The method of paying work relief wages should be based on the principles of meeting the needs of the refugees and local customs, such as issuing food, clothing, and daily necessities in lieu of cash. The Shanghai Winter Relief Committee will find ways to raise the aforementioned funds and materials, and the "Work Relief Group" will be responsible for distribution. The Municipal Public Works Bureau should give priority to employing disaster-stricken people in any construction projects it undertakes. At the same time, the "Work Relief Group" of the Winter Relief Committee should set up a "Labor Supply Station" to provide appropriate labor and necessary information at any time. The selection of work relief workers should be based on the following two points: (1) The scope and types of work relief should be considered in light of the circumstances and expanded as much as possible to accommodate refugees who need various types of work. (2) The "Work Relief Group" should supervise the "Labor Supply Station" to handle investigation, registration, and classification matters, and create a classified roster of refugees eligible for work relief and send it to the "Work Relief Group" for team formation and assignment to work relief sites. Work relief should avoid contracting as much as possible and be handled directly in principle, to prevent contractors from using relief materials to seek private gain. Surplus materials and equipment from the Executive Yuan Relief Administration that are suitable for work relief should be requested and allocated to the work relief agency as much as possible for full utilization. When the Winter Relief Committee concludes its work, the work relief agency should be transferred to the Shanghai Social Relief Association. Continue to be responsible for handling matters.</p>

<h3>### Bao Tianyi Cleared of Collaboration Charges, Official Misconduct Referred to Court for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Bao Tianyi, Chief of the First Section of the Investigation Section of the Administrative Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, served as the Criminal Section Chief of the Putuo Road Police Sub-Bureau during the occupation. In March of the 33rd year (of the Republican era, i.e., 1944), he was accused of prohibiting ferries from crossing the Xikang Road to Guangfu Road ferry terminal in that district.

After the victory, Cai reported Bao to the High Prosecutor's Office, which prosecuted him on suspicion of collaboration. After a trial by the High Court, it was determined that Bao had engaged in underground work and had not harmed the people, so the charge of collaboration was insufficient. The case was transferred to the local court for handling due to incorrect jurisdiction. The entire case file has now been handed over by the High Prosecutor's Office to the local Prosecutor's Office for review. The misconduct portion, namely, whether there was corruption and injury, will be investigated, and summonses will be issued in the coming days.</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] Gu Weijun, a voluntary police officer from the Xujiahui Police Station, was charged with shooting and killing resident Wang Wanshun on the night of June 23 of this year. After being prosecuted by the local Prosecutor's Office according to law, he was tried yesterday morning in the Criminal Court One by Judge Zhu Nianci. Wang Zhenxiong, the son of the victim, and Zhu, an investigator from the Xujiahui Sub-Bureau, were present as witnesses. The defendant was first brought forward, stating: On the night of the 23rd, I accompanied the Sub-Bureau Chief to the Hongqiao Theater to suppress a disturbance, but only maintained order on the road and did not enter the theater. When returning, I passed an old woman a dozen doors away from the theater, who said that her son had been arrested by the police. I said it didn't matter, he would be released. A dozen doors further, I was suddenly surrounded by more than ten people, who dragged me into a small alley and tore my clothes. They said, "We're going to strip you." For self-defense, I fired a shot into the air as a warning, and they scattered in a panic. I fled to the vicinity of the small garden and met brothers from the Sub-Bureau and Investigator Zhu, and immediately reported to Zhu that I had fired several shots due to nervousness. However, he flatly denied going to Wang Wanshun's house.</p>
<p>Next, Wang Zhenxiong, the son of the victim, testified: That night, I was studying at home until midnight and had not yet gone to bed. My father returned home very late and was eating supper downstairs. Around midnight, seven or eight plainclothes and uniformed police officers came and knocked on the door. Before we could open it, they broke it down. After entering, they didn't ask any questions and accused me of fighting outside. I said I hadn't gone out. Before I finished speaking, I was slapped and they tried to arrest me. My father stepped forward to reason with them, but Gu fired three shots at him, and he fell to the ground on the spot. Seeing that they had caused trouble, they all fled. I followed them to the small garden and saw Investigator Zhu, to whom I reported everything. Zhu asked Gu about it, and Gu admitted that he had fired several shots into the air. Investigator Zhu then sent the police to take Gu to the station and sent someone to investigate my house, where my father had already died. After questioning the witness Investigator Zhu, the court ordered that the case be adjourned for another hearing.</p>

<h3>"White in, Red Out" – Strange Letters Before the Election – Assassination Squad Discovered in Chengdu – Threatening the Municipal Government Secretary-General</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Chengdu, 5th via air] The election of Chengdu Municipal Councilors this year. Recently, the Central Government issued an order extending the term of the current Municipal Council, so the Municipal Government stopped processing [the elections], causing a huge uproar. The candidates jointly petitioned the Provincial Government, and will file an administrative lawsuit against the Municipal Government, accusing it of violating the law.</p>
<p>Recently, the organization of a "Candidate Assassination Squad" has appeared. On the 3rd, Xu Baokang, Secretary-General of the Chengdu Municipal Government, suddenly received a threatening letter, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"Mr. Baokang: Your proposals for the 'Municipal Election' are very good. Each of us has lost at least five million, not counting mental losses. Please return this amount according to the correspondence address, otherwise we will settle accounts with you sooner or later. White in, red out. From the Candidate Assassination Gang."

<h3>Central Government Designates Candidates Based on Merit First</h3>
<p>He Yaozu Discusses Election Issues in Chengdu</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Chengdu, 4th] On the eve of the general election, the election battle launched by Sichuan Province to strive for democratic constitutionalism has reached a mature stage. The Central Government specially dispatched He Yaozu, Sichuan Provincial Election Supervisor, to come to Chengdu from Beijing on the 25th of last month to guide the Sichuan election. On the 29th, he spoke to party members about "Establishing Democratic Style from the Election." After inspecting and guiding the election work, Mr. He expressed great satisfaction with the progress of this election in Sichuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, he spoke in great detail to reporters about the election issues: This time I came to Sichuan to guide party members in their election campaigns for legislative representatives and national representatives. Sichuan's party organization has always been sound and there has been seamless cooperation. I believe that there will be no disputes due to the election. Regarding the designation of candidates, the Central Government has instructed that "merit first" should be the guiding principle. The highest principle of our party organization is democratic centralism. The election comrades are free to submit to the review of the party group guidance committee in their respective counties and cities, and then the Central Guidance Committee will make the decision, which is in line with the modern democratic spirit. Establishing the country by suppressing the rebellion is the only goal of our party's future revolution. It depends on the party members to be of one mind and one heart and to share the same boat. Comrades in our party must register and be reviewed according to law. Once the Central Government makes a final decision, they should absolutely obey and support it unanimously. If they continue to run for election without being registered or nominated by the Central Government, it will be a violation of party discipline, and the party will impose severe punishment. Sichuan compatriots have made outstanding achievements in the process of our party's revolution, especially in supporting the eight-year war of resistance. More than 3 million Sichuan soldiers fought in the north and south of the Yangtze River, contributing manpower and material resources to complete the final victory. Their achievements are unprecedented in history. The people's organization was established the earliest. This constitutional government must be able to establish a democratic style throughout the country. After presiding over the election meeting in Chengdu, Mr. He will go to various places to inspect and plans to return to Beijing after the Double Tenth Festival to report back.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Municipal Criminal Police Department Plans to Use Police Dogs to Eradicate Opium and Drugs</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Chongqing, 4th via air] The problems of opium and drugs have not yet been eliminated in the city of Chongqing. The criminal police department of the police bureau believes that it is difficult to identify the secret transportation of drugs by human power. The technical office has recently formulated a police dog application plan to thoroughly eradicate opium and drugs. The price of grain in Chongqing has recently soared (the price of rice is 290,000 yuan per stone). It is said that the price of grain in the nearby rice-producing areas is only slightly different from the price here, so grain merchants are more willing to transport grain to expensive areas for sale, which has caused a shortage of food sources in the city and the price of grain is increasing day by day. It is confirmed that the Grain Association once planned to ask the authorities to set up grain loans to curb the rising price. After the adjustment of the foreign exchange market price, the price of gasoline here suddenly increased from 1.5 million yuan per large barrel (53 gallons) to 2.2 million yuan overnight. It is also difficult for merchants and the military to purchase it, and only a small amount can be retailed for short-distance transportation. The fare for public buses in the urban area has increased to 1,500 yuan per ticket. Tang Yi, Director of the Chongqing Municipal Police Bureau, has been ordered to be transferred to serve as a Major General Counselor in the Ministry of National Defense. Shi Juemin, the newly appointed Director, is said to be coming to Chongqing in mid-month to assume his new post.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Promotes Thrift – Restricts Banquet Prices</h3>

<h3>Report from the Supervisory Yuan in Full (Continued from Page Two) Second Conclusion</h3>
<p>Based on the above factual investigation, the members believe that the following points are worthy of attention:</p>
<p>A. Since the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, domestic and international situations have changed. On the one hand, the country is facing reconstruction after the war, with a shortage of resources, economic exhaustion, and currency inflation. On the other hand, after the restoration of transportation and trade with various countries, foreign goods have poured in like a tide, forming a shocking import surplus. Therefore, the foreign exchange problem not only affects the domestic economic situation but also involves the government's fiscal and financial policies. At the beginning of the victory, our government believed that the people, after eight years of hardship, had abundant financial resources and purchased large quantities of foreign goods to supplement their enjoyment. At that time, the government, holding a large amount of gold and foreign exchange, also adopted an extremely free and laissez-faire policy regarding the influx of foreign goods. From August 34 to November 35, under this laissez-faire policy, the government's original reserves of six million ounces of gold and over nine hundred million US dollars were largely depleted. Not only was the currency system unable to be reformed and prices unable to be stabilized, but most of this large amount of gold and US dollars failed to be used for constructive purposes. In addition, the control of foreign exchange was initially lacking in a sound structure, with former President Song solely approving its use, resulting in much waste (see Section B of the first section of this report and the investigation report on the gold rush case in this hospital in the spring of this year). This is a major loss to the country, and former President Song cannot but bear considerable responsibility.</p>
<p>B. Since November 17th of last year, as foreign exchange gradually decreased and prices rose daily, and especially after the gold rush occurred in February of this year, shocking the whole country, revisions were made successively to the provisional measures for import and export trade and the emergency measures for the economy. The foreign exchange policy went from extreme freedom and laissez-faire to extreme control and contraction. In this extremely changing process, not only did the government's foreign exchange policy appear tense and chaotic, causing the market to be unable to stabilize and prices to continue to soar, but also due to the repeated changes in institutions and frequent amendments to laws and regulations, wealthy merchants were able to calmly manipulate speculation, while ordinary merchants suffered from not knowing what to do. In addition, general discussions and criticisms gradually alienated merchants from the government's measures, and the implementation of policies became increasingly difficult. Although the official foreign exchange rate was fixed at 1.20,000, the distance between the black market and the official rate widened day by day, resulting in all overseas remittances and private foreign exchange flowing into the black market in recent months, and income gradually disappearing. Therefore, there was no choice but to adopt a parallel floating method for foreign exchange market prices and official markets on August 17th. In the future, there should be a thorough and appropriate decision on the foreign exchange control institution and methods to avoid constantly changing orders, causing hardship to both the government and merchants.</p>
<p>C. After eight years of victory in the War of Resistance against Japan, and further exacerbated by the rampant communist bandits, our country's economy is exhausted, and the people are struggling to survive. The whole country, from top to bottom, is striving to complete the great cause of nation-building with a spirit of perseverance and struggle. Therefore, the central government recently issued a clear order to vigorously practice thrift. However, looking at the use of more than 500 million US dollars over the past year or so (excluding the sold gold), little has been used for construction, cultural education, and improving people's lives, while most has been used for consumption, such as cigarettes, tobacco leaves, canned food, fruit, and glassware, which is inevitably close to waste. In the future, under the principle of thrift, the government should expand the scope of prohibiting the import of non-daily necessities and non-construction products (i.e., expand the scope of items in Appendix 4 of the revised provisional measures for import and export). As for liquid fuels, their uses should also be strictly controlled to achieve the purpose of thrift, so as to avoid the current proliferation of private cars in major commercial ports such as Shanghai, wasting gasoline.</p>
<p>D. Since the implementation of stricter controls on import trade last year, foreign merchants in general have been quite dissatisfied. The reports from the Associated Press in March of this year and the New York Afternoon News in July are clear examples. After investigation by the members, these public opinions inevitably have the following two misunderstandings: Ignorance of the true situation, such as the aforementioned Associated Press and Rundall both criticizing the ban on the import of wireless generators and electric refrigerators as luxury goods, while the World Trade Corporation, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Materials Supply Bureau imported large quantities. Regardless of the quantity of such items imported by the above-mentioned state-run agencies, wireless generators and electric refrigerators have always been treated in accordance with the tariff regulations since the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan and have never been regarded as luxury goods and prohibited from import. Chinese and foreign merchants have the opportunity to obtain the import of such goods under certain legal application procedures. Exaggerated malicious propaganda: China has long been in a position of economic colony. In the past, foreign merchants in China had concessions and other privileges, and their trade in China was in an absolutely superior position. Most of our import and export merchants relied on their favor. After the victory, the government's control was slightly stricter in order to adapt to China's current economic environment, and state-owned business agencies inevitably had some advantages. Foreign merchants felt unprecedented inconvenience, so they made exaggerated propaganda and criticism. While the孚中 and other companies have their shortcomings and need to be corrected, they cannot be used as a pretext to slander our government, nor can it be said that they are using political and other pressure to push foreign merchants out of the Chinese market. Moreover, the British and American firms represented by孚中扬子 and other companies, their sales of goods are also the materials manufactured by British and American entrepreneurs, used to promote them in the Chinese market.

However, major escort dance halls here are still operating as usual. According to city government officials, the dance halls have not stopped operating not because of opposition from the dance hall bosses or dance girls, but for the convenience of American soldiers. The city government has requested instructions from the central government and is awaiting a reply. In the past, the city government once decided to close all dance halls, and the American military authorities immediately requested that several be reserved for the use of American soldiers, which is impossible to exclude Chinese dancers.</p>

<p>(US News Agency, New York, 7th) A truly international school is being planned at the United Nations Headquarters at Lake Success, New York. After months of studying the special educational problems caused by the children of representatives and other personnel sent to the United Nations from various countries, experts from the Secretariat, under the leadership of Dr. Kaklan, Director of the Training Department, have drawn up a pilot school plan.

The first batch of students will include those between the ages of three and eleven, with each class having between seventy and one hundred children. In the future, it is expected that most of the 900 children of United Nations staff and most of the children of representatives from various countries will enter the school.

<h3>Textile Adjustment and Export Committee Meeting: Decision to Exchange Cotton for Yarn, Separate Regulations for Cotton from the Executive Yuan and Indian Cotton Exchange Standards</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Textile Adjustment and Export Committee of the Textile Adjustment Commission held a committee meeting at the Central Bank yesterday morning starting at 11:00 AM. President Zhang of the National Bank personally presided over the meeting. Shen Xirui, Tang Xinghai, Rong Yixin, Zhang Sili, Liu Gongyun, and representatives from the Executive Yuan were present. After discussion, two important resolutions were reached:</p>
<p>The method of handling 200,000 bales of cotton from the Executive Yuan has been fully decided. The exchange standard is 712.5 pounds of cotton for one standard package of 20-count yarn. National and private yarn factories will be treated equally. All cotton will be allocated according to the number of spindles in each factory.</p>
<p>To replenish raw materials, it has been decided to export one-tenth of the recent production of national and private yarn and cloth, which is expected to exchange for more than 100,000 bales of Indian cotton. The exchange standard has been negotiated by the National Bank: 1,150 pounds of Indian cotton for one standard package of our 20-count yarn. After the Indian cotton arrives, the National Bank will take 40%, and the national and private yarn factories will take 60%.</p>
<p>According to related sources, the cotton supplied by the Executive Yuan and India totals more than 300,000 bales, or about 1 million dan. Based on the current number of spindles opened in the cotton industry in this city, the raw materials can at least meet the needs for three to four months.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Prices Continue to Rise: 42-Count Blue Phoenix Rises by 1.3 Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the sales of yarn were not brisk, retailers were still eager to purchase, and it was heard that the black market gold price soared, affecting people's sentiment and greatly boosting prices, leading to a sharp increase in the market. Subsequently, supervisory personnel arrived at the market to monitor it, and it was rumored that the registration of stored yarn would begin on the 10th, leading to a weakening of the situation and a price drop. However, in the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn still rose by 1.3 million compared to the previous day, and 20-count Double Horse yarn also rose by 1 million. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn uniformly increased by 800,000 to 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>The cloth market opened in the morning with many floating sales, and asking prices once slightly decreased.

<h3>This Newspaper and Baoli Hospital Jointly Organize Obstetrical Assistance, Methods Similar to Renhe, Red Cross Society and Shangxian Hospitals</h3>
<p>In February of this year, when this newspaper jointly organized the "Obstetrical Assistance for Poor Women" campaign with Renhe Hospital, the First Hospital of the Red Cross Society, and Shangxian Maternity and Children's Hospital, we respectfully declined the cooperation of many hospitals that were willing to cooperate with this newspaper, fearing at the time that manpower and material resources would be insufficient, but the spirit of service and the benevolent enthusiasm of these three hospitals are always engraved in our hearts.</p>
<p>Eight months have passed, and the "Obstetrical Assistance for Poor Women" campaign has provided assistance to more than 100 pregnant women, enabling them to receive scientific production care. Due to financial constraints, we cannot expand as much as possible. To remedy this shortcoming, Baoli Hospital has provided us with great assistance. In the past four months, they have generously provided assistance to some pregnant women who missed out. Yesterday, we received a letter from Baoli Hospital saying:</p>
<p>"To whom it may concern: Since our hospital has cooperated with your newspaper, it has rescued dozens of poor pregnant women. Now, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of your newspaper, we intend to jointly organize obstetrical assistance for poor women with your newspaper to show our humble service to society. We request your approval."</p>
<p>We are very honored to be able to obtain the replenishment of new forces, and we are also fortunate for countless poor pregnant women.</p>
<p>Starting today, obstetrical assistance for poor women has added a new force, and at the same time, we hope that this movement can be more widely promoted and carried forward.</p>

<h3>Letter from Zhabei Water and Electricity Company</h3>
<p>It is found that the houses at No. 2, Hengfeng Lane, Sida Lane, Shanyin Road, had their own artesian wells to supply all water usage before the war. During the enemy occupation, the water pipes of the two lanes and the newly built Ziyuan Villa were connected to the company's tap water with a 100mm inlet pipe. After the war, the enemy returned, and the population of the two lanes has increased sharply. It is estimated that there are 1,244 faucets. According to the water supply regulations of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, for those who have a 100mm inlet pipe, the maximum number of internal faucets is limited to 200. Now, it exceeds more than six times, so it is inevitable that the water pressure on the second and third floors is difficult during the water consumption time of each household. The water pressure of the company's water supply pipe in that area is more than 45 feet even during the water consumption period, and there is no drop in pressure. Therefore, the method of improving the water supply in that area is to entrust a plumbing contractor to change the inlet pipe to a 150mm diameter pipe. After the installation is completed and reported to the company for inspection and approval, a 150mm diameter water meter can be replaced, and the water supply to each household can be improved. As for the water fee, the company collects it according to the price approved by the Public Works Bureau. We hope that you will publish this information to clarify the facts. This is addressed to the Social Service Editorial Department of Shen Bao. Zhabei Water and Electricity Co., Ltd.</p>
<h3>Inquiring about Gumei Villa</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I have a letter from a friend from out of town, asking me to find the address of Gumei Villa here. According to him, a coffin was stored in the villa in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Later, contact was lost due to the war of resistance. Recently, he wants to transport the coffin back to his hometown for burial. I have inquired among relatives and friends, some say that they have never heard of "Gumei Villa," and some say that the villa was closed before the war of resistance, and the details after that are unknown. Therefore, I would like to inquire about the following three points: Where is the current depository of coffins of Gumei Villa? What is the mailing address? If it has already closed, how were the unclaimed coffins handled at the time of closure? Cremation or burial in place? If cremated or buried in place, where is the ash from the cremation or the grave from the burial? If any kind person knows of this villa, please find a way to inform me in detail, then not only will my friend be endlessly grateful, but the deceased will also deeply feel the kindness even in the afterlife! Sincerely, Bian Depei (Mailing address: No. 13, Meifu Lane, Huanghe Road (9))</p>

<h3>The Story of an Old Shoemaker by John Galsworthy, Translated by Lin Fengzao</h3>
<p>I knew him from when I was very young, because he made shoes for my father. He and his brother lived together on a small street, two small shops combined—gone now, but at the time, they held a fashionable position in London's West End.</p>
<p>The store's distinctiveness was its quietness. There was no sign on the shopfront proclaiming that they served royal families—only his own German name, "Gessler Brothers Shop"; several pairs of shoes were displayed in the window. I remember, I never understood why those same pairs of shoes were always in the window. He never made ready-made goods, only custom orders. If you were to say that his work didn't fit, it would seem inconceivable. Were those shoes bought to display there? That also seemed inconceivable. He would never put leather goods made by others in his own shop. Moreover, those shoes were truly beautiful; for example, the pair of patent leather dancing shoes, those indescribably slender shoes, with the finest leather matched with fabric, made one salivate; and the pair of tan high-topped riding boots, though brand new, carried a strange, somber color, as if they had been worn for a hundred years. Only someone who could see the soul of the shoes could make these leather shoes—truly the embodiment of the spirits of all shoes. Of course, these thoughts only came to me after I became an adult, but when I was having shoes made there—around the age of fourteen—I sensed a certain dignity in him and his brother. Because making shoes—the shoes he made—then and now, seemed to me a magical and incredible thing.</p>
<p>I remember very clearly that one day, as I was stretching out my small foot for him to measure, I said embarrassedly:</p>
<p>"Mr. Gessler, isn't making shoes very troublesome?"</p>
<p>From within his ironic red-blond mustache, a smile suddenly appeared, and he replied: "It is an art!"</p>
<p>He, with his yellow and wrinkled face, red and curly hair and beard, wrinkles evenly spread across his face slanting down to the corners of his mouth, and monotonous guttural voice, seemed somewhat made of leather; because leather is a thing of irony, tough and clumsy. His expression was like that, but in his pair of blue-gray eyes, the simple strength of an idealist was hidden. His brother was much like him—though in every aspect a little worse, and also diligent—therefore in my early years, I always had to wait until I had spoken to them to distinguish them clearly. If I heard, "I must ask my brother," it was his brother; if not, it was him.</p>
<p>When a person grows up, they become rude, running up debts everywhere, but in any case, they would never run up a debt at Gessler Brothers Shop. For example, if you owed him money for two pairs of shoes, and you ran back, extending your foot towards his blue eyes behind steel-rimmed glasses, indicating that you were still his patron—that didn't seem like a decent thing to do.</p>
<p>In reality, going to his place often was impossible—his shoes were too durable. They had a timeless quality—you could say that they had the essence of leather shoes sewn into them.</p>
<p>When someone goes to a shop, they always have this feeling: "Quick, get the things, let me leave!" But going to this shop had a different sense of quiet, like walking into a church; you had to sit on that one wooden chair and wait—because there was always no one there. After a short while, from the corner of the house—which was quite dark, and had the soft smell of leather, this was the shop—his brother's face appeared, looking down. Then there was a guttural sound, and the sound of wooden clogs descending the narrow wooden staircase. He came before you, not wearing an outer garment, his body somewhat hunched, wearing a leather apron, his sleeves rolled up, his eyes blinking—as if he had just woken up from a dream of leather shoes, or like an owl startled by the bright light of day, showing unease.</p>
<p>I would say: "Mr. Gessler, how are you? Would you make me a pair of Russian leather shoes?"</p>
<p>He would not say a word, returning to his original place, or walking to another part of the shop, and I, continuing to sit on the wooden chair and wait, smelling the scent of leather. After a while, he would return, a piece of golden-brown leather in his thin and veined hand, his eyes on the leather, saying: "Such beautiful leather!" I also chimed in with praise. He would ask: "When do you need them?" I would reply: "Ah! At your convenience, the sooner the better." He would say: "Two weeks, is that okay?" If it were his brother, he would say: "Let me ask my brother!"</p>
<p>Then I would softly say: "Thank you! Goodbye, Mr. Gessler." He would reply, "Goodbye"—but his eyes were still looking at the leather in his hand. As I walked towards the door, I heard the sound of wooden clogs, and he was walking up the stairs, returning to the dream of leather shoes. But if I wanted a new style of leather shoe that he had never made for me before, he would become cautious—he would take off my shoe, hold it in his hands for a long time, observing it carefully, criticizing it, but also showing affection, as if recalling the brilliance he had created, and blaming others for ruining this masterpiece. Then, he would put my foot on a piece of paper, drawing around the edge of my foot with a pencil repeatedly, and stroking my toes with his trembling fingers, empathizing with the center of my needs.</p>
<p>One day, I happened to say to him: "Mr. Gessler, you see, the last pair of everyday shoes squeaked." This day, I cannot forget.</p>
<p>Hearing my words, he looked at me, not answering for a long time, as if wanting me to retract or correct my words. Then he said:</p>
<p>"The shoes should not squeak."</p>
<p>"But, it really is like that."</p>
<p>"You must have carelessly gotten them wet?"</p>
<p>"I think not."</p>
<p>Hearing these words, his gaze lowered, as if trying to recall that pair of shoes. I felt very sorry that I had brought up this serious matter.</p>
<p>"Send the shoes back!" he said, "I will examine them carefully."</p>
<p>I felt sympathy for that pair of squeaking shoes. I could imagine him bending over, with a worried curiosity, taking great effort to inspect the shoes.</p>
<p>He slowly said: "Many shoes are born bad. If these shoes cannot be repaired, I will not charge you."</p>
<p>Once (only once), I was careless. I wore a pair of shoes bought from a large company to his shop. Those shoes were bought out of temporary necessity. Although he agreed to still make shoes for me, he did not show me the leather. I could feel his eyes fixed on my awkward shoe. Finally, he said:</p>
<p>"These are not my shoes."</p>
<p>The tone was not angry, nor sad, nor disgusted, but it carried a component of quietness that made your blood freeze. He reached out his hand, and pressed a finger on the left shoe, where it was stylishly made, but not very comfortable.</p>
<p>He said: "It's uncomfortable here. Those big companies have no self-respect. Truly awkward goods!" Then, as if something internal made him lose self-control, he said many harsh words. Only this once did I hear him talk about the situation and difficulties of his business.</p>
<p>He said: "They have taken all the business away. They rely on advertising, not on work. We love shoes, but they have taken the business away. It has now reached the point—I have no work to do. It gets worse every year, you watch." Looking at his face full of wrinkles, I saw something I had not noticed before, which was the difficult circumstances and the difficult struggle—suddenly I saw that many of his red whiskers had turned gray.</p>
<p>I tried to explain, I told him under what circumstances I had bought that unlucky pair of shoes. But his face and voice moved me deeply. So, in a few minutes, I ordered many pairs of leather shoes. But the goddess of revenge was at work. These shoes were more durable than anything else. For almost two years, I really didn't have to go back to his place to have shoes made.</p>
<p>Finally, I went to his shop. Strangely, I found that one of the two small window cabinets outside his shop had someone else's name written on it, another shoemaker's name—of course, he made shoes for the royal family. Those familiar shoes were no longer sparsely occupying a position of dignity, but were squeezed into a small window cabinet. The reduced small shop inside smelled heavier than before, and the light was dimmer than before. Moreover, the looking down, the sound of wooden clogs, came slower than before. Finally, he stood before me, looking at me through his rusted iron-rimmed glasses, and said: "...Mr., is it not? "Ah! Mr. Gessler," I stuttered, "You know, your shoes are really too good! Look, these shoes are still very decent!" I extended my foot to him. He looked at it.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, "It seems like people generally don't want to wear good shoes anymore."</p>
<p>In order to escape his blaming eyes and voice, I hastily said: "How has your shop changed?"</p>
<p>He calmly replied: "Expenses are too high. Do you want to make shoes?"</p>
<p>Although I only needed two pairs of shoes, I ordered three pairs and quietly left. Although I didn't quite know, I always felt that he thought I was one of the people who were against him; perhaps not against him personally, but against his ideal of shoes. I thought, a person probably doesn't care much about this feeling; because, after several months, I went to patronize his shop again. I remember, I thought this: "Ah! Well, I can't ignore the old man—I'll go! Maybe I'll run into his brother!"</p>
<p>Because I knew that, in terms of his brother's character, he would not open his mouth to condemn, in fact, he wouldn't even have a closed mouth expression.</p>
<p>Arriving at the shop, I was relieved. It was his brother who came out, holding a piece of leather. "Ah, Mr. Gessler, how are you?" I said.</p>
<p>He came closer, gazing at me.</p>
<p>"I'm fine, but my brother is dead," he said slowly.</p>
<p>I knew it was him—but how old—I had never heard him mention his brother's name before, I was startled, and softly said: "Ah! How unfortunate!"</p>
<p>He replied: "Yes, he was a good man, he could make the best shoes, but he died." He touched the top of his head, his hair suddenly thinning a lot, becoming as sparse as his poor brother's. He told me how his brother died. "He lost the shop, he was always sad. Do you want shoes?" He held up the leather in his hand and said: "Such beautiful leather."</p>
<p>I ordered several pairs. They came after a long time—but were even better than before. They were simply indestructible. Not long after, I went abroad.</p>
<p>More than a year later, I returned to London. The first place I went was my old friend's shop. When I left, he looked like he was sixty years old, when I returned, he looked like he was seventy-five years old, poor, frail, and trembling. This time, he didn't recognize me.</p>
<p>I felt very sad, and said: "Ah! Mr. Gessler, the shoes you make are really good! Look, I have been wearing them almost all the time while I was abroad, and they are still not half old, are they?"</p>
<p>He looked at my shoes for a while—a pair of Russian leather shoes. His face seemed to regain its former stability. He put his hand on my shoe and said:</p>
<p>"Is it comfortable here? I remember, when I made this pair of shoes, it took a lot of effort."</p>
<p>I told him that the shoes were very comfortable.</p>
<p>He said: "Do you want more shoes? I can make them faster; I am very free now."</p>
<p>I replied: "Good, good! Any kind of shoes—all styles of shoes!"</p>
<p>"I want to make a new style. Your feet must have grown a little." He drew my foot shape for me, and touched my toes, the movements were very slow. Only once did he raise his head and look at me, he said;</p>
<p>"Did I tell you, my brother is dead?"</p>
<p>He became very frail, making one feel sad. I couldn't wait to leave him.</p>
<p>I had forgotten about the ordered shoes. But one night the shoes arrived, I opened the package, and lined up the four pairs of shoes. Then tried them on one by one. No faults at all. The style, size, width, and the quality of the leather, everything was good, these were the best shoes he had ever made for me. In the mouth of a pair of ordinary walking shoes, I found his bill. Although the price was the same as usual, I was very shocked. He never sent a bill before the end of the season. I rushed downstairs, signed a check, and immediately mailed it.</p>
<p>A week later, passing by this small street, I wanted to run to tell him how well the newly made shoes fit. I walked to the front of the shop, and couldn't find his name. The black patent leather slender dancing shoes, the fine leather fitted with leather tops, and the dark gray riding boots, were still in the window cabinet.</p>
<p>I walked in, feeling very uneasy. In these two small shops—which had been combined into one again—there was a young Englishman.</p>
<p>I asked: "Is Mr. Gessler at home?"</p>
<p>He looked at me, his eyes were strange, but showing goodwill.</p>
<p>He said: "Sir, he is not, not. But we would be very happy to take your order. We have taken over this shop. You must have seen our name on the storefront next door. We make shoes for many important people."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," I said; "But Mr. Gessler?"</p>
<p>He replied: "Ah! He's dead." "Dead! I received the shoes he made for me last Wednesday!"</p>
<p>"Ah!" he said; "That's a shocking thing. The poor old man starved himself to death."</p>
<p>"Heavens!"</p>
<p>"The doctor said it was chronic starvation! You see, this is how he worked! He had to open the shop; but wouldn't let anyone touch his shoes. He accepted a business deal, it took a lot of time. People lost patience. So the patrons all ran away. But he still sat there, working non-stop—I would like to say a fair word for him—no one in London could make better shoes than him! Just look at the people competing with him! He never advertised! He had to use the best leather, and do it himself. Ah, this is the result. He had his ideas, see what can be done?"</p>
<p>"But, starvation..."</p>
<p>"As people say, I may be exaggerating a little—but I know personally, he was still making his shoes day and night until the end. I often watched him. He never had time to eat properly; never kept a copper in the house. All his money was spent on leather and rent. I simply can't understand how he was able to live for so many years. He often ran out of food. He was really a character. But he made very good shoes."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "He made very good shoes."</p>
<p>I turned around and walked out immediately, because I didn't want the young man to know that my eyes were filled with tears, almost unable to see.</p>

<h3>An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Not to mention the roundness of Tianjin people, even ordinary people experienced in the ways of the world, in this situation of national subjugation, would be unwilling to utter the naked description of "spy dog" to a stranger. Yaoqun naturally felt a little surprised; she hadn't expected that the information she wanted to inquire about would be so effortless to obtain, a complete success. She had never thought that Tianjin, which had fallen into enemy hands, would dare to blurt out such taboo words; not to mention patriotic words, it at least proved their hatred of the enemy. This reminded Yaoqun of the saying "Yan and Zhao have many generous and tragic scholars," Tianjin people are sometimes extremely bold; if they get angry. At the same time, the underground work in this area is also quite effective, so the people's spirit is still very strong.</p>
<p>From the mouths of these two greeters, Yaoqun learned that this transvestite Mai Shafu had arrived in Tianjin before and after the July 7th Incident, and had been working as a detective dog, wandering back and forth in upper, middle, and lower class hotels; sometimes when he got excited, he would put on a military uniform and riding breeches, and call some prostitutes to accompany him to drink.</p>
<p>"But not necessarily"; finally, the two greeters told Yaoqun: "Just two days ago, the Japanese devils came to arrest people—two secret agents of our government—but she let them go. We don't quite understand what this guy is up to."</p>
<p>As soon as Yaoqun returned to room number twenty-seven, this transvestite Mai Shafu followed closely behind. Starting off, he gave Yaoqun a frontal assault:</p>
<p>"Miss Ji, let's 'open the skylight and speak frankly,' it goes without saying that there must be a mission. Can you be frank and disclose your goal: Are you simply dispatched to collect case information? Or are you here specifically to take on liaison work, preparing to organize students and young people? Or did you bring a way to rescue those comrades?—You know, the day before yesterday at midnight, a total of two underground radio stations were broken up, and seven or eight comrades were arrested!"</p>
<p>If you were Yaoqun, putting yourself in her shoes, how would you parry this sudden frontal assault from Mai Shafu? At the same time, he had so accurately uncovered most of Yaoqun's background; if you were in that situation, how would you deal with it? If you stuttered, saying half and implying half, that would show that you don't have enough material, and this guy would laugh his head off. What if you completely denied it? That would not only fail to deny it, but also show that you are a novice "tenderfoot." You would simply be looked down upon. You must know that this guy is very resourceful. Unless he has seized the handle, he would never dare to be so rash and come to Yaoqun for a public negotiation like this face to face; therefore, even if you deny it, you cannot deny it. Yaoqun is proud and arrogant, would she be willing to use this inferior tactic and become a laughing stock in front of a strong enemy?</p>
<p>So, how would you deal with it? Is it possible to be more of a rogue, patting your chest: "I, your father, don't change my name, I don't change my surname..." Risking eating a set of Jianghu (underworld) rules, admitting frankly in one breath: "I am doing this"; then, if it goes well, we can join hands and make friends; if the talk breaks down, of course, we will each show our skills and fight to the death?</p>
