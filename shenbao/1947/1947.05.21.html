<h3>蔣主席在參會致詞　重申薪求和平決心　政府仍願政治解決國是</h3>

<p>〔又電〕參政會第一次大會原定廿日下午舉行，由行政院長張軍作政治報告，惟因主席團主席王世杰·王雲五二氏提出辭職，經主席團張伯苓·江庸·吳貽芳·李璜決定停開。</p>
<h3>今日大會改選主席團</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕參政會主席團人選中，有王世杰，王雲五兩氏業已出任政府官吏，十九日參政員茶會席上，有人提出改選問題，廿日午十一時主席團特召集會議討論改選間題，計出席張伯苓，江庸，吳貽芳，李璜四氏，當決定王世杰，王雲五兩氏辭職後由民社，國民兩黨各一人出任，聞當時曾經蔣主席同意。至人選問題，定廿一日上午大會中改選。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十日電〕參政會二十一日上午議事日程，除秘書處報告參政員請假函電外，報告事項有：（一）駐會委員會會務報告，（二）第四屆第二次大會建議事項實施情形報告，（三）張羣政治報告，（四）主席團改選事宜。</p>
<p>〔本報南京二十日電」參政會大會日程修正如次：廿一日上午政治報告，下午社會，司法，行政報告。廿二日上午外交報告，下午糧食，農林報告。二十三日上午財政報告，下午軍事，內政報告。廿四日上午交通，善救報告，下午經濟，資委會報告。廿五日上午教育，衛生報告。廿六日上午水利，地政報告。廿七·廿八兩日，全日審查會，廿九日上午審查會，卅日·卅一日·六月一日上午，均爲大會，二日上午大會，下午大會並舉行休會式。又太會提案改於廿九日晚八時截止。</p>
<h3>張伯苓開幕詞</h3>
<p>〔中天社南京廿日電〕第四屆國民參政會第三次大會廿日開幕，主席張伯苓氏致開會詞如下：　「今天是第四屆國民參政會第三次大會集會的日子，伯苓得與同人重聚一堂，眞是無限快慰。回憶自本會成立迄今，已九易寒著，大會開過十二次之多，而伯苓除上次因病未能出席之外，皆躬與其事，今幸病愈歸來有參加機會，願將個人的感想，略說一二，以就教於各位同人。　本會所以成立，是因爲政府決定對日抗戰的國策，需要全國一致精誠團結，集中力量，集中意志，以期得到最後的勝利。抗戰期間，我國在蔣主席領導之下，將士效命，爲國浴血，全國同胞，茹苦含辛，卒能克服强寇，光復河山，本會同人，亦以風雨同舟的精神，對於政府的大政方針，以及應興應革的事，知無不言，言無不盡，自問在職權之內，我們更盡了最大的努力。國民參政會在抗戰史中，確是光榮的一頁。伯苓一生，前六十年幾乎全在國恥國難中渡過。這些國恥國難，都是親自經歷，感痛萬分。我想年事稍長的同人，一定與我同感。伯苓生長在天津，天津舊日的租界是不平等條約的具體表現，是萬惡之源，住在租界的中國人，可以漸漸不知有中國，有租界一日，中國便一日不能翻身，而現在呢，侵略我們的敵寇打倒了，租界收回了，不平等條約取銷了。從此以後，中國自己要怎麽樣好，就怎麽樣好，再也沒有束縛和障礙了。中國已經得到了自由。</p>
<p>再說，伯苓新近從外國回來，觀察國際形勢，雖然目前尚有許多未解決的糾紛，而避戰求和，乃是列强一致的願望，中國在國際的地位，有人說又在下降，其責關於世界的問題，中國的意見，仍爲人所重視。中國自己的問題，我們反對國際干涉，國際就不能千涉，這比往日外人在中國予取予求，隨意劃分勢力範圍的時候，眞是不可同日而語。中國的地位，比十年前，二十年前，三十年，四十年前，高了不知多少。目前中國在國際的地位，是五十年以來，不曾有過的高峯，中國已經得到了平等。　因此回想過去，展望將來，從大處看，往遠處看，中國的前途，實在有無限的光明目前的困難是難免的而前途的光明，是毫無疑義的！</p>
<p>目前的困難，使人苦悶，甚至於使人失望的原故，在於我們希望過奢。勝利來得太快，我們沒有準備，勝利就到了，我們努力不够，就得了勝利，我們沒有把敵人趕出國境，敵人便投降了。這勝利太便宜了。便宜的勝利，使我們有了許多錯誤的認識和妄想。我們以爲我們勝利，想必我們的努力够了，我們的努力足以換取勝利。這是認識的錯誤。我們以爲勝利之後，諸事自然迎刃而解，絲毫不消費力，勝利的收穫，自然會來。我們以爲勝利後的和平與繁榮，伸手可得，俯抬即是。我們以爲抗戰旣已勝利，復員的工作，不必費事，建國的工作，自然就會開始。我們以爲我們旣然能攘外，一定能够安內。這都是我們的妄想。勝利之初，伯苓也是妄想者之一，如今纔知道自已的錯誤，由勝利的便宜，而引起妄想引起奢望，奢望引起失望，因爲勝利來得便宜，我們覺得目前的困難都出乎意料之外。</p>
<p>目前的困難，也誠然嚴重，最嚴重的莫過於經濟困難，而經濟困難的主因大家都以爲在於國內的戰爭，國家需要統一，而國內有武力的對抗，人民需要安定，而現有者祗是擾攘與紛亂。國家爲人民謀福利，這是應該的，國內的戰爭，再繼續下去人民便活不了，這是實情，因此國內的和平，成了當前最緊要的問題。國民參政會的職責，在於表達民意，建議政府，伯苓以爲我們這次開會，大可以將國內的和平，作爲主題，將和平問題廣泛的討論，澈底的討論，將涉及和平的事實，盡量的說出來，將促進和平實現和平的方法，具體的提出來，將討論的結果，向政府建議，向人民宣佈，如果經本會伺人的努力，全國得到和平的曙光，那麼本會的使命，可以完成，本會同人也有莫大的榮光」。</p>
<h3>莫德惠返台北　談張學良近況　莫定明日來滬轉京</h3>
<p>〔中央社　北十九日電〕莫德惠昨由新竹　返抵台北，定廿二日乘中興輪返滬轉京出席參展政會。渠係十二日前往採視往探視張學良，與張氏共處七日，記者今日下午趨訪？據莫氏稱：張氏所居之淸泉，舊名井上溫泉，環境遠較貴州之舊居幽　，渠之身體及精神亦較雲　爲佳，渠現每晨七時即起，上午全部時間讀書，下午則打網球，並赴溫泉沐浴，該地因無電燈，晚間睡眠極早。莫氏稱：張氏每日研讀明史，均作　記，並製成明代皇帝年表，置諸書案，又稱。今日之張學良，逈非昔日之張少帥，渠現對於軍事絕無興趣，對於政治亦極淡然，渠曾偶一談及，願仿王陽明，朱熹築齊講學，此或爲一時之冥想，然渠曾鄭重表示，願入中央研究院充任研究員，終身研究學術。張氏日前會作詩一首，詩云：「十載無多病　故人亦未歸，餘生烽火後，惟一願讀書。」俗云：「書中自資金屋」，今日之張學良，顯已決意終身與書作伴矣。莫氏又稱，趙四小姐名趙一荻，伊父曾任津浦路局局長，外傅爲趙爾　之女，實爲錯誤，伊現爲張氏之助手，亦爲張氏之良友，每日上午協助張氏抄摘剳記，下午則陪張氏打球，又有信緘多封，託莫氏帶京，其中包括呈蔣主席函及致宋子文，孔祥熙函，另有家書分寄張太夫人及夫人于鳳至。</p>
<h3>熊式輝抵京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕東北行轅主任熊式輝，廿日下午二時由平乘機抵京。據悉：熊氏此行係向中樞治商關於東北局勢之對策。週內即返瀋。</p>
<h3>蒙陰以東地區　共軍三路北究</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿日電〕沿膠濟路之王耀武部，十九日收復明水，章邱後，繼續向東掃蕩，至廿晚已進至普集附近，原竄沂，莒，蒙，湯四角地區共軍一部，廿日晨已越萊蕪東卅公里之魯村繼續北竄。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州日電〕蒙陰東地區之決戰，現已告一段落·共軍又慘遭敗北，分三路向北逃竄，共軍華東野戰軍司令部已移設臨沂西南沂水西北之悅莊，國軍挾戰勝餘威，亦分三路跟踪猛追，中路已越孫祖之綫，向北前進，東路共軍已無力固守莒縣，逕奔諸城，莒縣指日可下，西路則進至新　東北廿八公里之北師店，馬山及前後孤山一帶，正與共軍殘部激戰。</p>
<h3>昌黎縣城收復　共軍分路退竄</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿日電〕北寗路國軍，昨分自東西沿綫馳援昌黎，共軍據抗竟日，廿日上午十時攻克城北哈泊鎮及車站，迄午完全收復縣城，共軍傷亡頗重，分路退竄撫甯·樂亭境·國軍刻正乘勢追擊城郊殘共，北甯車日內即可恢復。瀋商會向參會建議</p>
<h3>對日和會　應在瀋舉行　瀋商會向參會建議</h3>
<p>〔中央社瀋陽廿日電〕瀋陽市商會以第二次大戰導源於九一八事變日寇之佔據瀋陽，頃建議政府，採取主動外交，照會各國，對日和會應於本年九月十八日起在瀋舉行，俾使世界人類警惕慘禍，鑒往知來，並謀復興東北建設新中國。此案業經委託束北參政員王卉一携京，請由莫德惠領銜提出參政會大會公決。</p>

<h3>參政會拾零</h3>
<p>— 本報記者張明</p>
<p>堂皇的國大會堂，在五月的朝輝裏發着光，並且發着聲。他的門敵開着，今天這個日子，從淸早起，牠吞吐着三百多個來自各地，携帶着千萬同胞意的參政員們。大會堂任車致遠的，再開始他在國民大會以後表達民意的重職。</p>
<p>這次參政會爲大會以來的第十二次大會，是勝利後的第二次大會，是還都後的第一次大會，也是在南京召開的第一次會參政員總額是三六二人，今天來了二三七人。</p>
<p>主席團出席最早的是王世杰，第二個是王雲五，開會前，主席團張伯苓，吳貽芳等都從台下走到台後去·兩分鐘後又一個個下來，只留下張老，因爲他是今天大會的主席。張老一付黑色的眼睛，昂長的身　，站在那裏，雖是古稀的年紀，還是發射出了强幹的力量，像不可動搖的樣子、</p>
<p>參政員代表致詞的于斌主教，今天長袍　　，　度翩翩，說話時口齒極爲淸晰</p>
<p>政府首長到遂最早的是吳文官長鼎昌，第二個是張部長厲生，國府委員陳布雷，一套灰色中山服，悄悄的走到簽到處，留下了他的簽名後，走向會堂裏去。陳立夫一走進來就是笑客滿面，臉是紅的，髮是白的，正是紅顏白髮集於一入。</p>
<p>朱家　一套夏季西裝，很文靜的和在塲的參政員們握手言歡。</p>
<p>女參政員羅衡中山服畢挺，一雙白皮鞋，和人握手點頭，頗有紳士風度。陳逸雲自從泛亞會議歸國，風姿更加飄逸，梳一個大音，很洒脫的。詩人盧前參政員，二百磅以上的體重，平時總穿一身中裝綢衫，今天白色西服一套，黑色領帶，黃皮鞋。</p>
<p>今天的大會秩序單上，「向國　及國父遺像行三鞠躬體」，還是排列出來了，而且行禮時，記者特別注意，所有的人都行了禮。原因是昨天的茶話會中曾決定謹向國旗鞠躬，而無「國父遺像」在內者，當時有人反對，認爲國父與國旗並列，行禮時豈非國父遺像要回避？何况國旗代表國家，國父手創民國，並無不同之處，所以今天各黨各派的人還是向國父行了天鞠躬禮。</p>
<p>參政會的全體人員走進了國大會堂，還是有空落之感。於是過去在重慶軍委會大禮堂開會時擠在角落裏，和在國大時擁不下去的記者們，今天却坐在中間，很舒服的享受參政員的「聽政」的權利。</p>
<p>會塲的布置異於國大的，是國旗少，所有放國旗的地方，都以國花圖案來裝點了。簡單莊嚴，主席台前的花也减少了。大會秘書長邵力子曾一再的說「要節省」，這次是减少了不少繁文褥節的裝飾。</p>
<h3>政院第四次會通過　麥斯武德主新疆　新省委艾沙兼任秘書長</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕十九日下午行政院第四次會議，通過兼理新疆省政府主席張治中無庸兼理，新疆省政府委員兼秘書長劉孟純另有任用，應免本兼各職，任命麥斯武德（見圖）爲新疆省政府委員兼主席，委員艾沙兼秘書長。</p>
<h3>參政會開會式席上　蔣主席致詞全文</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕蔣主席廿日上午在國民參政會第四屆三次大會開會式席上，致詞全文如次：</p>
<p>告位參政員：</p>
<p>今天我們國民參政會舉行第四屆第三次大會，距離上次大會，已有年餘。政府自去年還都以後，初則忙於復員工作，繼又因國民大會的召集，東北台灣各省，市參政員的增補選，接着又有政府的改組，所以遲至今天，始得召集大會，各位先生或久任議席，或新膺民選，遠道跋涉，齊集首都，貢獻謀　。本人特代袋政府，致誠摯的　勞和歡迎。</p>
<p>參政會在抗戰期間，擁護國策，領導人民，協助政府，對於國家的貢獻很大。抗戰勝利以後，參政會同人，在中央，在地方協助復員工作的進行，淸查各地敵偽物資的接收和處理，尤其各位駐會參政員，不憚動勞，盡　職責，對政府多所獻替，本八和政府同人，深表感激。這次集會參政員的名額，由二百九十各，增至三百六十二名，參加的人數多，集思廣益的效力更見宏大，相信各位一定能本着以往九年來的精神，竭忠殫慮爲國策謀久遠的利益，爲政府作直諫的諍友，發揚抗戰勝利的偉績，促進復興建國的完成。</p>
<p>在貴會上次大會閉會以後，這一年中間，國家所遭遇艱難，人民所身受的痛苦，各位皆所周知，不待再爲縷述。我們在此期間，始終以百折不慨的決心，求和平統一的實現，爲了解救全國人民的痛苦，爲了排除復員建設的障礙，爲了求取國家社會的安定，我們曾以最大的忍耐，不斷的努力，以求實現「軍隊國家化」，「政治民主化」的要求，可是所得到的結果，是共產黨的堅決拒絕。共產黨拒絕了五人小組和三人小組的商談，拒絕了停止衝突，恢復交通的成議，拒絕執行整軍統編方案，拒絕出席國民大會與參加改組政府，最後又拒絕了政府派員赴延安商洽和平的建議。我們苦心忍讓，委曲全的目的，成爲泡影。但是我們政治民主化的一貫努力，不能因共產黨的阻撓而延緩。去年十一月國民大會的召集，制定了中華民國的憲法，確定了憲法施行的日期。接着改組國民政府，結束一黨訓政。這一點，可以說實現了。我們國民參政會多年以來實施憲政的願望，差可告慰於貴會同人。國民政府改組以後，我們仍然秉持中共問題，以政治解決的基本方針，但是和平統一的能否實現，完全繫於共產黨的態度。我們對於共產黨，祗是希望其放棄以武力奪取政權的企圖，停止軍事行動，恢復全國交通，只望他們以事實表示其誠意。政府無時不企求和平，自可用政治方法，謀取解決，以解人民於倒懸。這一個方針，相信符合全國國民公意的要求，亦必爲貴會同人所贊助，這是本席所要首先說明的。</p>
<p>爲了和平統一的沒有實現，國家不能得到和平建設的環境，復員和救濟，到處遭受到重大的阻碍。同胞們備受和平秩序破壞的威脅和痛苦，經濟生活因而不能得到穩定，社會秩序和國民道德也因此而受到嚴重的影響。這實在是我們國家在戰後一切不能進入正軌的主因。政府職責所在，自然要排除萬難，負起責任，治標治本，悉力以赴。貴會同人，關心國事，一定有嘉謀嘉猷，貢獻政府。關於各部門的行政設施，主管當局另有報告。本席希望於各位參政員先生的，主要有下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一，憲法頒布以後，行憲法規，已經陸續制定。這次施行憲政，是我們中華民國民主政治成敗的關鍵。現在距離憲法的施行，祗有七個月，以我們中國地區這樣的廣大，自治基礎和教育基礙，這樣的薄弱，關於進行各種選舉和樹立憲政規模的一切準備工作，頭緒紛繁，各位參政員先生，無論在中央在地方，都希望隨時盡力予以協助。</p>
<p>第二，當前的經濟、財政，金融和物價問題，影響着國民一般的生活，也關係於國家建設的進行。政府對此問題，正在苦心焦慮，覓取妥善解決的途徑，本年二月間，所頒布的經濟緊急措施，當然要求其貫澈，但在執行的技術上，以及步驟的緩急輕重，與乎各地特殊情形的如何適應，流弊的如何防止，各位先生對此問題，關切有素，希望盡量貢獻意見，俾能更收完滿切實的效果。此外有沒有應該補充的地方，也希望提供意見，政府必當虛心考慮，付之實施。</p>
<p>第三，行政效率的提高，影響於庶政的推行和人民的福利至爲重大。貴會上次大會所提出的　　更　，實際就是行政效率的另一面。政府　　貪污，具有抉心，但根本之計，還在洞悉地方政治的利病，和實際執行的情形。我們要造成　潔的政治，更要造成迅速確實，有能力，有效率的政治。各位洞悉民瘼，希望宣達民情，指陳得失，務使中央與地方，得以溝通，國家與人民，均受實益。</p>
<p>最後本席要爲各位先生，痛切提出一個最根本的問題，這就是國民道德和一般風氣的問題。回想抗戰時間，我們中國以薄弱的基礎，進行艱苦的戰爭，終於越過重重難關，贏得光榮勝利。本席認爲是舉國一致遵守兩句共同準則的結果。這兩句準則，就是「國家至上，民族至上」與「意志集中，力量集中」。自從抗戰結束以後，一般國民，在八年緊張艱苦之餘，鬆弛了戒愼恐懼的心理，喪失了公而忘私的精神，以致國家觀念和國民責任觀念，白漸低落。這不能不說是復興建國最大陣碍，現在國事仍極艱難，建設正待開始，全賴我全國同胞，集中意志，集中力量，忍勞忍苦，共濟艱危、以造成建國的新風氣。各位參政員先生，爲社會的先覺，人民的導師。深望此次集會·對於轉移社會風氣·發揚膦國精神，提高責任觀念，確立法治基礎，有切實精神的討論·以２號召全民，共向實現民主究成建國之大這而邁進。本席個人尤盼各位不　箴規，多所匡正，俾克無媿於負荷之重。謹祝各位先生健康，並祝大會成功！</p>

<h3>學行行動越軌　平社軒通電呼籲　今後切望政府整節學風</h3>
<p>〔中央社北平日日電〕平市工·農·商·文教·婦女等十一團體，頃爲學潮問題，通電全國，茲錄原文如次：中共倡亂，堵塞和談之門，政府用兵，實出萬不得已，全國同胞，咸明此旨，故能出錢出力，一心一德，協助政府，進行戰亂，抗戰勝利之後，內亂繼以爆發，十載之間，干戈未息，國家財政支絀，人民羅掘俱窮，實乃意料中事，爲爭永久福，暫時　苦支持，故能樂於忍受。方今戡亂戰事節節勝利，共軍逼處窮途，覆滅可期，爲岡挽向頹勢，乃逞其慣技，阻　撓旅大接收，破壞國際貸款，策動各地學生罷課，藉端要挾，煽惑人心，擾亂社會，平市淸華等校，更假反內戰，反釩餓爲名，公然出動街頭，呌囂　駡，聚衆門毆，毀法蕩紀，莫此爲甚。自抗戰發生，朝野人士雖高呼軍事第一，然對教育琳業，從不略加忽視，縱使移東補西，亦必勉力維持，而大學之中，更設公費制度，救濟家在敵偽區域之學生，雖當局局緊張之際，仍能弦歌不輟，當局賢明措施，早爲國人稱道。不意目下一部學生不明是非，不辨利害，受奸人之唆使，作越軌之行勤，大好靑年，廿作政治工具，堂堂學府，竟成造亂增所，當此人民生活極端痛苦之際，彼輩竟得免費求學，政府對之，可謂仁至義盡，豈意彼等意猶未足，高呼反飢餓，要求增加公費，實直接給予政府以困難，間接掠奪人民之衣食，靑年學生茍不自居爲特殊階級，何能任意至此。况內戰責任，至爲明顯，不得顯爲假借，中共倘能還軍於國，放棄地下工作網領，和平當可立致，乃至少數學生不此之圖，竟在政府區內，高呼反對內戰，居心何在，不問可知。十年以來，各界同胞所受之痛苦，過於學生百倍，所得之優遇不及學生什一，同胞直接担負鉅額教育經費，目睹時下學風敗壞，理雖緘默，今後切望政府嚴加整飭，不稍姑息，學校如成造亂之所，應即斷然解散，學生如願爲虎作倀，自當嚴予懲處，庶幾刁頑之風可以過止，百年大計維繫不墜。更望全國同胞，督責政府，安定社會秩序，激勵前方將士，克竟戡亂全功，使和平早臨，本會等願與全國同胞共相策勉，臨電神馳，諸維共鑒。又該十一團體同時並致電蔣主席、內容大致與前電相同。</p>
<h3>京學生遊行請願　參加十六校部份學生僅三千人　與憲警起衝突數人受傷</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕中大學生自治會廿日晚集會，聞廿日仍將罷課。又金大等校之學生代表亦舉行聯席會議，今後可能繼續有所行動。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕京·滬·蘇·杭區十六專科學校學生代表在京舉行之遊行請願，經校方及當局勸阻，未收全效，仍於廿日實現，惟參加之學校及人數，較之預定計劃爲少。東方語專，藥專，及音樂院均未出動，劇專出動者被阻，中大金大亦均僅部份參加，益以蘇滬杭各校代表，總數僅三千人。大隊十時即出發，傍晚始返，前後共八小時，沿途秩序尚佳，僅十一時許大隊經珠江路口時，與警察發生斜紛，致有受傷及被捕者，一間行列於參政會附近等候，約六小時，經學生代表與參政會秘書長邵力子接洽，終於下午六時許整隊而過參會門自，再經成賢街等地，各歸原校。</p>
<p>遊行學生係九時自中大出發，大隊至十時五十分許到達珠江路，徒手憲警三百餘人，已阻於路，附近店舖亦全部閉門。交涉達十分鐘之久，憲警方面表示彼等奉命執行任務，恕難放行，學生方面要求通過，正忙亂間，一部學生高呼前進，惟旋經同學勸止。交涉無結果，大隊乃於口號中前進，十一時五分許，在塲憲警除憲兵及路西警察仍守原崗位外，中路警察以水龍兩條，紛向大隊　射，同時學生亦以旗桿及裝汕漆之鐵桶相拒，在三次攔阻中，雙方均有受傷者。此時學生衝過封鎖綫者約佔十分之六，維持秩序之警察，又在珠江路及新街口一帶與學生發生衝突。沿途店舖，紛紛關門。學生至十二時許退去，該地交通至午始恢復。據東區警局局長陳善周告記者，紛亂中有一李姓督察受傷，已送營治療。及大隊學生於十二時許到達國府路時，參政會在望，憲兵騎巡隊警察及防護團勸阻學生前進，形勢頗緊張，學生不能前進，乃派代表往參會請願。此時被阻於珠江路口等地之同學，亦紛紛繞道趕到，靜坐路中冒雨鵠候，四時許，學生代表臨時於馬路中舉行招待會，席地而坐，五時，七代表由參會總務主任王同榮陪同歸來，報告接治經過，事件暫告解決。騎巡隊遂於五時五十分許，退守碑亭巷口東側，學生大隊於六時許整隊前進，沿途高呼口號。至六時大雨又降，此爲午後第三次陣雨，亦爲最大一次舉雨，二千餘學生於雨中魚貫而過參政會，前後共歷一刻鐘，大隊返抵中大解散時，已暮色蒼茫矣。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿日電〕二十日京市學生遊行，據調查，大多數專科以上學校如金女大。政大·藥專·語專·音專·劇專等均未參加，實際參加者僅中大學生一零六二人，佔全數四分之一弱，金大學生一三零人，沾全數九分之一强，英士大學參加者亦僅百餘人，均屬絕對少數。</p>
<h3>接見學生代表　邵力子苦口勸說　聚衆脅迫情事舉世所無</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕參政會秘書長邵力子廿日下午三時三刻接見遊行學生代表七人，其時遊行學生已進抵林森路而被阻，學生代表首說明學生請願目的，僅在爲挽救教育危機，並向參政會提出書面意見，請大會對提高教育經費，能予注意，不幸在珠江路口被阻，茲擬請求將書面意見轉交，同時設法允被阻之同學通過，彼等一再說明請願目的單純，邵氏以從容姿勢稱，關於同學返校問題，可以商洽決定，如果汝等願意返校，當無不可，惟軍警僅爲執行法令，防備遊行隊伍抵參會，而參會正在會議中實有妨碍會務之嫌。至於國務會議通過辦法，防制請願遊行人數及處理辦法，其實即在英美，於必要時，亦可採取解散之決策，何况英美遊行，僅在遊行時高呼口號，將其希望公開表達，從無聚衆脅迫情事，過去數日中學生赴政院謂願，曾將職員晚餐吃光，此外尚有其他不好現象，故始有處理辦法之擬定。政府與學生一體，政府行確有不合理，自可不服從，然決不可聚衆脅迫。旋邵氏就學生所提書面意見中全部學生改爲公費生一點，加以解釋稱：余於廿年前曾在蘇聯，後亦在蘇任大使，余所見之蘇聯教育，在廿年前亦僅一部份公費，餘皆自費，其在戰時，僅一鐵路之技術職業學校爲公費，其餘均爲自費、目前則均爲自費。汝等所提全部公費一點，政府財力不夠，同時亦不公平，汝等應加以考慮，惟邵氏仍立即表示書面意見可以接受，並　！致主席團及參政員全體。旋學生提出希望數點，邵氏答稱：余僅爲轉迷性質，惟就余者來，政府對醫　費及責任之追究，必要負責。旋爲研究同學返校路徑，略有研討，並與衛戍部通電話決定，學生代表即於四時許離去。</p>
<h3>金大一部學生　擅取校旗被阻</h3>

<h3>首都衛戌司令　張鎮生因傷致死說無稽</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京二十日電〕首都衛戍司令部二十日下午六時舉行記者招待會，張鎭代司令官發表書面談話，報告本日中大金大等校遊行示威經過，略稱：當今晨本部派赴金大之徒手憲警於阻止該校學生外出時，適有巡邏武裝憲警經過，（該項巡邏憲警係担任經常維持秧序者，並非負有阻止學生之任務。）因見秩序紊亂，曾向天空鳴槍示警，但學生仍然外出，本部爲避兌發生意外，當將平日派出之巡遍武裝憲警一律撤回，故學生遊行隊伍於抵達珠江路口，阻止學生前進者完全爲徒手憲兵與警察。當時學生摩拳擦掌，數次準備衝過徒手憲警行列，初持半小時許，學生遂相互挽臂，一聲喊衝，即向徒手憲警橫面衝過，而後續隊伍亦挽臂搭肩，一擁而上，秩序因而紊亂，在塲警察初擬以水能放水驅散，不意水管已被有組織之學生糾察隊所奪，反特水管射向側面與地上，此時學生之斜察隊宣傳隊行動愈形劇烈，乃紛紛以書寫標語用之鐵質油墨罐及旗桿，並向附近商店奪取木棒，向徒手憲警攻擊，當時情形極形混亂，陷入互毆互　狀態，憲警數十人　設傷，當時地面積水路滑，此　　搭肩之學生，與在塲憲警，致多有跌仆者，學生亦有十餘名受傷，截至下午四時止，已查明警察憲兵之受傷者二十八名，學生亦有十餘名受傷，惟以學生持有鐵罐旗桿等作爲武器，故實際受傷者憲警當較學生爲多。迨學生遊行隊伍進至林森路兩端，徒手憲警再度出阻。此時爲避免學生再度與憲警衝突，故不得不以騎巡排列槍隊阻之。下午四時許，遊行學生曾派代表到參政會要求見邵秘書長，並向本部提請求釋放被捕者，撫卹死傷等要求，經派本部衛代參謀長接見，告以死亡絕非事實，所捕學生四名，係當塲聚毆憲警之出乎，當依法送法院辦理。至本市一二家晚報登載學生因傷致死之謠言，經憲警機關派員調查，僅中大附屬醫院有受傷學生十一人前往醫治，其中九人係皮膚擦傷，經敷藥後即行出院，其餘孫傲蒼一人，左膝蓋骨受傷，范繼淹左上眼皮受傷，現住院醫治，情形並不嚴重云。</p>

<h3>日所有流動資金　儘先作佔領費用　遠東委會昨日公布決定</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕遠東委負會今日公佈政策，對於日本賠款分配應得之分，作一項決定，實際上承認美國有優先權。傳將日本流資金，作爲償付佔領費及救濟義用之抵押品。該項決定規定：任何分攤皆不能不顧及佔領費用之償付。據消息靈通人士稱：此一條款之制定，乃受美國之指示，表明美國由於其實際上負擔一切佔領，洪給日人食糧，及其他新物資之費用，自應對日本之黃金及其他流動資金，有提出要求之優先權。</p>
<p>遠東委員會之指令並規定：賠款之搬移，不准妨礙該會前所規定以一九三四年爲　準之日本人民農低限度之生活標準。遠東委員會又在大體上裁定：賠款應根據廣汎之政治基礎分攤，對每一要求國家，所受到之物質及個人生命毀壞與損失範圍，因而有賠償及懲處日本侵略結果產生者，予以適當之注意，同時並應對每一國家打倒日本之貢獻，其中包括其抵抗日本侵略規模之大小時期之久擊，亦匯加以適當之注意。遠東委員會時別將海外資金，不列入此項決定政策範圍之內。此一決定，與遠東委員會之普遍觀點相符合，即該會對此項資金，不加　問，而將其主要工作着重於日本國內資金分攤問題上是也。同時遠東委員會宣佈：該會對於日本國外貿易，亦作兩項放寬其限制之決定，一項關於日本進口之來源，另一項關於日本出口之目的地。該會規定：日本出口計劃之主要目的，乃在使日本出口，送往能獲得最大現金之地區，作爲一種商業出口，而有別於作爲賠償之用之商品移動。換言之，日本商品祇能供應願以日本所缺乏之進口物，或以可立即賺買此項出口之現金作爲償付之受主。至於日本之出口，遠東委員會決定，應以最便利與最便宜方面獲得，惟又規定，祗有聯合國家之利益，在交易此項對其中任何一國有重要利害關係之商品時，始能考慮及之云。</p>

<h3>蒙藏委會委員長　許世英自港抵滬　據談蒙藏政策應先謀邊疆安定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕新任蒙藏委員會委員長許世英，昨日自港抵滬，方治，楊嘯天，王正廷等，親赴輪埠迎接。行政院張院畏，陳立夫，吳忠信，羅良鑑，吳國楨諸氏，亦均派代表前往歡迎。許氏定廿三一日搭夜車晋京履新。</p>
<p>記者往訪，並詢以對蒙藏之政策，氏謂：蒙藏政策，政府當有決定，本人在謁見蔣主席及張院長前，不能有所發表。但在原則上言，今日之蒙藏政策，應注重聯絡其感情，幫助其經濟，改善其生活，提高其幸福等各方面入手。而最主要者，爲先謀邊疆之安定，然後決定計劃，按步徐進。記者以許氏駐日有年，特詢以對日本局勢之觀察，許氏請：我國應重視日本，日本一般平民並不願意整軍經武對外侵略，而願發展經濟增强富力，今日盟軍之管制政策，恰與其志願相符。日本在明年內，輕工業即可復元，我國今後在軍事上不致受日本威脅，但在經濟上仍將在短期內成爲侵略之目標，此則值得國人之警惕。</p>
<p>許氏現年七十五歲，精神　　，與記者侃侃談半小時，毫無倦容，渠尚係抗戰後首次來滬。許世英（右）與王正廷合影</p>

<h3>復課方是「搶救教育」！</h3>
<p>連日因各地學潮的澎湃，不免引起一般的社會不安。政府爲安定社會秩序，因於一昨頒布維持社會秩序臨時辦法六項。對於是項臨時辦法之公布，本報已一再有所論述，希望一般人民共體時艱，各就其本位，予以衷誠的協助。乃不期前項緊急辦法方經公布，而各地少數學生猶有所謂「饑餓遊行」，甚至號稱「吃光運動」，標榜「搶救教育」，怪誕離奇，不一而足，最後則圖窮七見，變質而爲政治性的所謂「反內戰」的羣衆運動。昨天首都學生因遊行而與軍警衝突，不免互有受傷。此誠靑年學生之不幸，抑亦社會國家之不幸。惟不幸中尚有一些好消息，則上海南京平津一帶，前昨均已有若干學生發動復課運動，這纔是近乎「搶救教育」了。</p>
<p>平心而論，學生在寶貴的靑年時期，爲了搶救教育而罷課，而請願，而遊行，實在令人不解·這些行動的本身，就不無與「搶救教育」之旨相背。罷課，請願，遊行，它們本身都足以荒廢學業：如果必須這樣纔可「搶救教育」，那是最滑稽可笑之事！至於所謂「吃光運動」，姑不論此一運動的展開，將置靑年人格於何地，卽在事實上，實亦未盡合理。當今國立大學內有公費生，由國家津貼其食宿，但須知同時亦有多數非公費生，更須知同時尚有更多的私立大學學生和中小學生並無公費，尤當知供養高等學府的公費生者乃爲大多數自身生活非常困苦的人民。大學生如不放縱其情感而信任其理智，則必有懸崖勒馬的一天。果然一部分學生正在變質罷課的時候，便有一部學生要復課了。在若干地方，參加復課運動的簽名人數且多於主張罷課的人。上海復旦大學的復課，就是一個顯明的例子。我們欣幸於一般學生，能在熱情洋溢之餘，已開始有理智的回復，而理智的正當運用，又恰是教育的首要目的。我們希望各地學生都能有這種趨勢，使社會的秩序能够安定下來。故我們以爲罷課決不是搶救教育，而復課纔是搶救教育的起碼條件。</p>
<p>我們相信，號召罷課企圖達到他們的政治目的者，只有少數學生，甚至此若干學生近來卽以鼓煽風潮爲「專業」，而多數純良好學之學生，因畏羣衆之威脅，俯首以受其挾制，心中原欲上課求學，而苦於散漫孤獨，一若無可有所作爲，於是積非成是，「吃光」居然可以成爲運動，而「罷課」也竟可詭稱「搶救教育」了。天下事本來祗有是與非之鬥爭，正與邪之鬥爭，只有站在「是」的一面，「正」的一面者，大家結合起來，要守法，要復課，要求學，誰復得而阻北他們？彼以叫囂紛擾爲能事者，淸夜自問，亦何嘗不自悟其「非」，何嘗不不自悔其「邪」？所願負教育之責的先生們，要懷於於國家社會以及學生家長付託之重，因勢利導，循循善誘，扶植其「是」者「正」者的一羣良好靑年，使他們能發出正義的呼聲，領導光明的行動，同時感化其誤入於「非」者「邪」者的歧途的學生，使他們過而能改，回歸學校，重續絃歌，則教育前途庶幾有望！</p>

<h3>自由黨拒不合作　日組閣又起波折　吉田內閣昨循例總辭職</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿日電〕吉田首相於廿日上午十時晋宮覲見日皇，遞辭職表，同時由內閣通知參衆兩院事務局，至此，吉田內閣已總辭職矣。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿日電〕四黨聯合內閣問題，社會鐵已正式表示拒絕吉田之要求，是則自由黨勢將落於在野黨地位，目前時局重心，已轉移至民主，社會，國民協同三黨聯合閣工作云。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿日電〕日本政局雖已在唇槍舌劍之下談判數日，然枝節橫生，迄至國會召集之日，非但未獲致解決方案，且更發生一大波折。</p>
<p>今晨片山吉田會談中，吉田突提出要求解決社會黨左派問題。片山對此表示難色，吉田再重申同意片山出任首相之意後，即表示願以在野黨之地位協助片山內閣。繼之，片山在社會黨中央執行委員會中報告經過後，全體一致決議：由片山全權處理政局問題，並認爲四黨聯合內閣倘告失敗，即進行三黨聯合工作，再不成功，即與國民協同黨兩黨聯合組閣亦可。</p>
<p>但目前除片山出任首相一事已無問題外，其他正副議長等問題，均尚朱談及。今日此一波折發生後，一切組閣工作又須從新開始，因此國會雖仍如期召開，但選舉正副議長事亦無法進行，開會後即草草宣告休會。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿日電〕民主黨蘆田總裁本日就當前政局及議長二問題發表談話稱：『民主黨不問自由黨是否入閣，仍贊同並參加聯合內閣。關於自由黨反對社會黨左派入閣之議，民主黨並無意見。四黨聯合內閣倘不能成立，則不妨組織三黨內閣。如自由黨自願退居在野黨地位，則議長一職似由民主黨担任較爲相宜。」</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿日電〕民主黨爲與自由黨競爭在衆院之第二黨地位，現正展開對無黨派及其他方面之拉攏工作。獲得第二黨地位之後，即可進行競爭誠長問題。</p>
<h3>印局已臨决定階段　蒙巴頓建議分治　英閣開始討論印督方案</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十九日電〕印督蒙巴頓今日飛抵此間後，即與艾德禮首相與英內閣印度事務小組委員會其他委員舉行會議。聞印督曾携來印回教徒對其交還印度政權程序方案成立協議之諾言。負責人士稱，依照蒙氏方案，英國當將印度政權移交予『至少兩個制憲議會」，一屬於回教徒，另一屬於印度教徒。該方案大要不外－（一）解散新德里現有之制憲議會。目前此一議會大部份爲印度國大黨所控制，而爲回盟排斥。（二）代以印度教徒與回教徒各別之議會，草擬印度分治憲法。（三）孟加拉與本哲布兩大省內部當實行分治。（四）西北邊省或將實行公民投票，決定自治抑或併入印度教徒區或回教徒區。（五）現有各黨聯台臨時政府之權力或將移交予綜合臨時新政府，由每一制憲議會指定代表參加。</p>
<p>其他討論之問題，尚有公共衛生·防疫·交通·糧荒·灌溉及森林等。國防部長亞力山大與印度英軍總司令歐慶萊克元帥亦參加曾議。一部份人士認爲兩氏參加會議意義極大，預示印度分治之可能危機。因回教徒要求將目前印度軍隊中之印回教徒混合編制改爲印回分編，此一問題即印督突然返國之主要原因。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十九日電〕據主管方面談稱：英閣之意見，現正逐漸趨向於贊成印度之劃分，劃分計劃將在印度造成二個分離之邦，其一爲印度教徒之印度斯坦，另一爲回教徒之巴基斯坦。巴基斯坦將由二片不相連接之士地（本哲布與孟加拉）所組成，其位處於印度「Ｖ」字形地勢之兩端，故殆將遭遇甚多困難。預料軍界人士對劃分計劃殆將表示反對。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿日電〕『每日郵報」今日載稱：巴頓已向艾德禮提出一項建議，主張召集印度領袖至倫敦舉行會議，以代替定於六月廿五日將在西姆拉所舉行之會議。</p>
<h3>哈里曼主張　恢復行目工商業</h3>
<p>〔聯合社洛杉磯十九日電〕商務部長哈里曼今日在洛杉磯市政應發表演說，主張恢復德日兩國平時經濟。據稱，全世界今日一片凄慘景象，到處困苦，德國恢復平時工商業，使其不能再向鄰邦攻擊，但能進行平時貿易，此於歐洲經濟之復興，至爲重要，猶之日本經濟乃遠東一般復興與經濟建設所必要。日本切不可再任其攻擊世界和平各國，但不可令其成爲經濟生產與交換上之死物。日本之貧乏，一如德國之貧乏，不僅成爲怨憤與痛苦之源泉，且將妨礙重建該區其他國家之一切努力云。</p>
<h3>葛羅米柯暢論　原子能管制</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約二十日電〕蘇聯出席聯合國機構安全理事會代表葛羅米柯，今日在美蘇學會發表演說稱，美國欲壟斷原子能生產，係屬一種錯覺。若非聯合國機構採取迅速行動，禁用原子兵器，美國即將處於不甚有利之地位。一國欲謀專利，勢必引起他國競爭，一國以原子　用於軍事，他國亦能採取同樣行動。因此互相猜　，必致妨碍邦交，彼此不能信任。在目前環境下禁用原子兵器，美國之犧牲將較他國爲大，此固無可否認，惟一國欲圖　斷，祗能限於暫時，亦屬毫無疑問。葛氏復切言三點：（一）聯合國機構必須立刻禁厘子與集體毀滅武器。（二）原于武器禁止後，蘇聯即同意國際管制與監察辦法。（三）監察辦法須限於確保原子能和平用途之發展，且不可妨礙蘇聯內部經濟。</p>

<h3>美代表啓程赴土</h3>

<p>土總統伊諾努譴責共產主義</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社土耳其京城十九日電〕本日爲土耳其靑年節，伊諾努總統發表演說，公然譴責共產主義及種族意識，其言有曰：「在大戰期間，都拉尼亞民族運動，係受敵人之煽動，曾企圖四出活動，但土耳其靑年並非愚人，甘受其愚弄。其後該派又以前進之口號，民主及反法西斯相號召，幾將形成危險之運動，但亦未能成功。凡此各種意識，均屬錯誤。土國所有一切之政治發展，必須在合法的範圍內進行，民主政體雖時遭困難者，但必能逐漸進步。要之，余相信民主政治必能達到安定云。</p>

<p>〔路透社莫斯科十九日電〕蘇聯領袖經濟學家伐爾迦，在今日之眞理報爲文，部言近東油權之爭，今已全面展開。英國爲增强基爾庫克－海發油管之運輸量起見，擬自伊朗至地中海岸另築一油管預計可於一九四九年築成。美國最近在巴勒斯坦及埃及之活躍，可證美國擬在該兩地獲得沙地阿拉伯石油之出海口，以供戰略上之用途。美國顯然將乘英國經濟困難之時期，迫使英國對於有關中東石油政策之各項問題，作有利於美國之解決。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十九日電〕蘇聯經濟學家伐爾迦眞理報撰文論稱，美國正謀成爲地中海之覇權，不惜出以種種壟斷，企圓分得其他國家大部份油源。美國擁有全世界人口百分之六，及全世界已開發油源百分之卅五，應能知足，不該再事覬覦他國油源。近東與中東方面今美國需要在油管通達之各海岸，獲得有力據點。巴勒斯坦與埃及脫離英國勢力後，即將成爲此種據點，接連沙地阿拉伯之油管庶可通至該處，此乃美國在各該區大規模活動之一理由云。</p>

<p>（一）他們發動「吃光」「光吃」運動，這是我們良心上願意作的嗎？我們的公費已經增加到七萬餘元了，（米金及副食費合算），我們每隔三天有一次「牙祭」，在每月十六日以後，每餐都有魚有肉，我們還要在可憐的老百姓的頭上，索取來滿足我們的奢望嗎？我們如何忍心奪取老百姓的命根，提高我們的享受？（二）他們反對會考和總考，現在敎部已允許會考總考不舉行了，我們還有所藉口要鬧嗎？我們實在想不出鬧的理由在那裏？（三）他們反對「內戰」，其實何嘗是內戰，純粹是共產黨的內亂，我們為什麼不想想「政府幾次下停戰令，而共產黨就幾次拼命要打，政府幾次央求和談，而共產黨就根本不理」的事實呢？我們需要和平，我們反對內亂，但是內戴的責任，不應由政府負担的，而且相反的，是應由共產黨負起。（四）他們要搶救敎育，搶救敎育就是呌千萬個靑年享受着公費的待遇，坐在學學裏天天罷課，荒廢學業嗎？搶救敎育，就是把學校鬧得天翻地覆，片刻不安嗎？他們的口號呌的是很響，但是他們的陰謀是很毒的，所以我們希望共產黨拿出良心來，不要再用搶救敎育的美名，來摧殘敎育，同時我們呼籲政府，來搶救靑年。</p>
<p>再鬧罷課就是自殺</p>
<p>總之他們呌出好聽的名辭，够多了，他們的良心是被金錢收買去了，我們爲了我們的「前途」，爲了我們上要對得住祖宗，下要對得住子孫，中間要對得住自己，爲了我們還要保留四萬萬五千萬同胞的一綫生命，我們在這裏憑着良心，用千行的眼淚，用凄慘的聲音，在諸位父老兄弟姊妹的面前，喊出以下的口號：（一）要求政府拿出辦法來，制止共產黨在學校裏活動！（二）我們請求政府制裁違抗法令的學生！（三）我們請求政府保護眞正護校的靑年！（四）反對內亂，是老百姓的要求。反內戰，是共產黨的口號。（五）內亂是共產黨造成的，和平是共產黨破壞的。（六）反內亂，應先消滅共產黨。求和平，應先消滅共產黨。（七）愛國學生，不要受共產黨及其尾巴的欺騙。（八）吃光，鬧光，打光，是共產黨亡國的三大政策。（九）罷課運動，是靑年自殺運動。（十）我們學生要安定學校。（十一）我們學生要吃飯，更要讀書。（十二）我們學生要求都已達到了再鬧罷課，就是自殺。（十三）我們反對做人家政治鬥爭工具。（十四）我們要保持純潔愛國靑年人格。（十五）我們一切爲了國家。（十六）人人要和平，只有共產黨不要和平。（十七）反對純潔靑年運動，變成政治鬥爭工具。</p>
<h3>維護學業運動　十項主張</h3>
<p>〔又訊〕本市各專科以上學校學生，以邇來爲英大遷校，交大改制，中大公費等問題，所引起的學生運動，激盪全市各校，於擾攘不寗，不能一志學習，殊感不安，爰於昨日下午六時，假大同大學，舉行會議，到本市各大專校代表十六單位四十餘人，決定組織成立上海市大專學生維護學業還動聯合會，聯合全市學生護校復課，以維學業，並發表宣言，提出十項主張如下：（一）我們主張：加强學生遝動，以貫澈我們合理的要求，但認爲罷課只是一種手段，而不是目的，也不就等於學生運動。（二）我們主張：護校復課，是每一個學生的權利與義務，也就是學生運動中要爭取的具體的目標，復課所以充實我們行動的力量，護校所以保全我們工作上的據點。（三）我們主張：自由的保陣與實任感的自覺，是相對的，要求自由，必先了解自由的意義，崇尙法治，必先學習法治的習慣。（四）我們主張：政治的革新，民生的改善，並不像玩弄魔術一樣的輕易，一樣的可以變幻立就，這必需要時間，要人力，尤其要安定。（五）我們主張：今日同學必須正視現實，團結自强，勉爲社會最進步與最大之安定力量。（六）我們主張：永遠反對內戰，是保障敎育工作，增加敎育經費的唯一前提，但必須更進一步更具體地來澈底檢討內戰的資任，而打擊罪魁。（七）我們主張：眞正的千古罪人，唯有好事之徒，煽動仇視，依仗暴力的就是好戰之徒，人類除了寬容諒解。不能阻止分裂的永久的悲劇。（八）我們主張：眞正愛國愛人類的靑年，必先了解社會幸福，以及民族決勝的關鍵，是基於實騐室與圖書館的工作，而不在乎標語口號的眩耀。（九）我們主張：羣衆的力量，大於領袖，一個最成功的運動，是一個最能够傳取社會同精的運動，而師長與父母的期望，乃是一種最關切的同情。（十）我們主張：惟有　環能使我們自由，學習認識眞理，必先恢復理性，這將使個人的意氣更爲無聊，而敎育的意義尤見重要。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市交大。復旦。暨南。上醫。滬江。之江。大同·同濟·中法藥專等院校，於上週先後發生罷課學潮，迄昨日止尙未平息。惟其中除復旦及交大四年級學生已於昨日復課外，暨南亦於今日起復課。</p>

<h3>廣帮乃紗廠帮猛進　華股昨又見漲風　永紗增資傳說甚多　大戶不惜全力進撲</h3>
<p>華股昨以廣帮及紗廠帮買胃更强，永紗在更爲有利之增資傳說中，領導羣股，漲停後，貼價甚巨，信和次之。惟一般雜牌及中小型股不逮遠甚，此乃大戶全力向永紗進撲，有以致之。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>時即交各股勤興見疲，麗安榮豐目先漲停，遞永紗登塲，八九號等力購，竟開高至六五〇〇元。傳永紗有不同說法之增資（二十九股迄八十四股）流言也。開後八九號一六二號一八五號四號九七號俱進，曾數度漲達停板。九四號一〇五號一〇六號八二號一五七號二一九號六五號一五二號俱售，而盤低至六四〇〇元以下。一八六號一四號二三一號趁低維持，稍有掙扎，一五四號八號一〇〇號九一號三〇號二一八號一九六號等連續脫手，遞永紗曾步降至六〇〇〇元大關。四號八號一六二號七六號八九號進至六三八〇元，九四號一五五號一九七號三六號六五號二二三號再賣，火柴中絲景綸俱吿跌停，又退入六一〇〇元內。六一號一〇五號一〇六號二三五號一四三號一六二號一七號俱進，廣帮力購，十一時後，又回漲到六五〇〇元。二一三號二二六號七五號六五號脫手，而退至六三八〇元。後以百萬元之平行綫本粟之說又起，一五五號一四三號一五二號一四二號一八三號三五號八五號連袂購納，永紗麗安亦告漲停，午收又升至六五三〇元光景。結果較前收計永紗漲停，信和美亞新光微升，新華跌成半，勤興平永公跌半成，景福微挫。遞交計永紗升一成弱，信和美亞升半成，永公勤興各跌半成，新光景福微隆。冷股計麗安漲停，榮豐漲停後微回，火柴中絲景綸跌停後有回，商務微升，餘挫半成。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>塲外已預行喊高，遞永紗上塲即停。一一七號一五三號一一二號一八五號俱進，麗安榮豐永公次第漲停，即交永紗亦達限度，此後不得不進行暗市交易。九一號一八五號四七號八二號一八三號咸進，美亞商務亦達停限，遞永紗喊價高至七千元。信和由一二六號四號六九號等掛漲停，後以場外已有回低，經二四號一八六號一四四號賣出，喊價曾低至六八〇〇元。三時十五分後，二二四號，一五二號二一三號等來進，最後又升至七千元外。但交易有限，乃四行兩局差出十八億也。結果較前收計永紗信和永公漲停，美亞漲停後有回，升一成弱。新華勤興微升，新光升一成弱，景福漲半成强。遞交計永紗信和漲停，美亞漲停有回，升一成不到。永公亦然，升一成張，勤興景福小漲，新光漲半成强。冷股榮豐麗安商務漲達限度，大通火柴中絲景綸跌停後有回，計前者升半成，後三種微挫及跌半成不等。新亞後市無成交，尙跌半成。塲外各老股除閘北微升外，餘均平疲。</p>
<h3>統債續跌</h3>
<p>公債昨供過於求，散戶咸加了結。統丙晨開一四〇〇〇元，高價一四三〇〇元，低價一二九〇〇元，最後在一三七〇〇元掙扎。五五〇室有納，三六〇室則出。成交約五百萬。結果較前收計甲乙丁各跌一千五，統丙降一千元，統戊亦挫一千四。</p>
<h3>外股升降不一</h3>
<p>外股昨午前因申電報縮而形穩定，怡紗晨開七三〇〇〇元，自七一〇〇〇元起，午收在七二〇〇〇元外掙扎。錢兌業稍售，證券帮廣帮則納，午後華股之鼓動，仍由證券帮吸納之。怡紗遂單獨盤升至七五〇〇〇元左右結束。結果較前收計怡紗業廣各升半成，餘股升降不一。</p>
<h3>米市繼續上漲　白粳創新高峰　高貨做價每石卅三萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕米市因產地價格報漲，繼續上昇。據米商稱：產地價格之漲，則由於農忙及存米欠缺之故。昨北市塲到貨七三三四石，南市塲到貨五二一一石。白粳高貨做卅一萬八千元至卅三萬元之鉅。中貨卅一萬元至卅一萬五千元。次貨卅萬元至卅萬三千元。</p>

<h3>徵烘青堅秀</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市：本市各出口行鑒於國外來價奇緊，一味企圖壓抑，而貨方則因目前成本，頗有與日同增之勢，遂不忍再度輕脫。收市結果，雙方復趨相持之局，交易甚稀，過程虛浮。他若內銷茶去化尙吿絡繹，行情在賣買互有中，盤旋如故。惟到存兩稀之去年度徽州烘青，因執貨者心思堅秀，兼以問津者較形熱鬧，市氣獨呈活潑。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕第六區棉紡業公會，爲籲請撤銷管制紗布輸往漢口辦法，昨特函陳紡管會，略稱：管制紗布運銷辦汰，對於廠商運輸困難情形，迭經陳請解禁在案。現今上海所存棉紗布銷路呆滯，有　塞之象，而華南華北等地，需求殷切，又有缺貨之感。供求失調，影響殊巨。同業各廠，實有窒息坐斃之勢，乃見報載，近又頒布紗布輸往漢口申請審核簡則，事前旣未提出大會討論，驟然出此，殊深駭異。經提本會第二十次理事會討論，僉以漢口爲華中區轉運之中心，如宜昌重慶成都等內地各埠，均以漢口爲集中分轉總站。若再予以限制，不啻扼上海各埠之咽喉。該項申請簡則，萬難接受，應請即予撤銷。同時對於華南河北東北各地紗布運銷禁令，亦盼尅日開放，以紓商困。</p>
<h3>紗價回挫</h3>
<p>昨日紗市因銀　轉緊，布價平穩，染織廠對於辦紗稍納即停，而客帮購胃不健，市塲籌碼又呈充裕，喊價遂不支。四二支藍鳳最後價爲一千二百卅五萬元，比上日軋小五萬元。二十支特雙馬七百零五萬元，回小廿五萬元。雙馬紗六百八十萬元，回挫三十萬元。其餘十六支各牌紗價亦一律回挫云。</p>
<h3>布價續漲</h3>
<p>棉布市况，深色一九〇號土林布，因坯布上升，又以米糧迭創新高峯，影響民營廠各布之成本增加，是以開市時，士林布市氣大俏。一九〇芷江士林最後高至五十五萬，比上日猛升四萬元。鶵鷄上壽一統等牌，亦漲二萬元左右。元府綢因現貨不充，四二支上壽做高至卅六萬五千元，亦漲三萬五千元，十二磅龍頭細布新多脫售，價爲卅萬號十六千元，軋降二千元，五福藍鷄彩球各牌，價亦軋低，自五千元至七八千元，其餘細斜嗶嘰元布等價俱下瀉，自五千元至一萬元。</p>
<p>紡建公司昨供售布疋卅餘種，五福細布一種，價廿六萬元，申購者不多。藍鷄及特銀月花鳥細布六十碼華達呢均限染廠由購云</p>
<h3>捲煙漲跌互見</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，晨開因同業補納頗暢，喊價續吿上揚。其中以頤中公司烟進提較多，華商烟亦呈微堅。塲中大英烟自七百五十五萬元喊開，以拋賣不多，而吸收者不寂，至午收時價高在六十五萬元徘徊頗久，午後市勢因中華公司辦理派貨，而銀根見緊，買勢轉懈。兼有多頭出籠，致價回降，收盤結果，十支大英價爲七百廿五萬，比上日軋小廿八萬元。老刀六百九十萬元，成交數箱，長後亦回小六萬元爲六百八十萬元。其餘華商烟則漲跌互見云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中華烟公司昨日起辦理派貨手續，針甲卡派全　　斧各兩箱，價爲一五〇〇萬元。乙卡照例减半，丙卡派雙斧金祿各半　，價三七五萬元。</p>
<p>又廣東路元利烟行，買進茄力克一箱，計二百聽，價每廳爲五萬六千五百元。</p>
<h3>實銷戶有吸收　人造絲始疲終堅　廠絲沰價見挫做開甚寥</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲始疲終堅，一二〇號高山有光一千六百五十萬元開盤，因有實銷戶吸收，又見上升，頃刻間即喊八十萬元，中午收盤達七百萬元。下午喊價回落十萬元，終與上日價軋平。一二〇號孔雀地球新貨，價喊六百六十萬元，七五號半光喊價站定未更。</p>
<p>廠經交易，可稱絕無使有。昨喊價雖稍露疲意，但做開甚寥。昨市C字等級仍有成交，價與上日相同。五天期票二千〇九十萬元，其餘各級，俱乏做開。</p>
<p>綢貨因原料平定，實銷清淡，故廠盤大都未動。昨市塲中，眞絲被面喊價比上日略小十萬元之譜，大誠格子璧縐晨開三萬一千二百元，最小一千元。後因求過於供，遂又上升至一千五百元賣出。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕第四區絲織業公會，爲謀各會員廠技術上之改進，及出品產銷計劃起見，籌組市塲於台灣路該會新址內。經第七次理監事會議推定蔡昕濤，童莘伯，宋保林，沈伯鳴等二十五人爲籌備員，定於今日下午三時，召開第一次籌備會，商議進行云。</p>
<h3>日用品價平穩</h3>
<p>昨日用品肥皂初開交易尙暢，惟逢高供意不寂，價乃穩中帶軟。一二〇塊黃祥茂由廿六萬三四千元喊升至七八千元，午收時在六七千元，頗多做開。午後供求平淡，價稍回降，初爲廿六萬五千元，至最後價爲廿六萬元有成交。火柴洋燭則鮮升降。火油聞派貨充沛，存底不薄，行情則呈平定。針高度桶裝喊價爲六十三四萬元，聽裝八萬七八千元，亞細亞八萬三四千元。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕昨南市萬利號，賣出華南商新黃祥茂肥皂五十箱，價做廿六萬一千元。</p>
<h3>煙煤略見活動</h3>
<p>煤市烟煤實銷戶逢低有吸，市勢略見活動。白煤行市雖仍堅穩，然去胃則略呈遜色。焦炭因產地辦貨者過多，辦價報昇，然所辦焦炭雙因運輸困難，一時無法運滬，致滬地貨主藉口產地辨價較昇，見機扳俏。</p>
<h3>五金市況</h3>
<p>本星期各種五金貨品及售價，均在平安途中。僅洋釘售價不動，倍司照前略加一倍，乃係人工上漲之故。</p>
<h3>中茶聯營公司　積極推進台灣茶葉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國茶業聯營公司總經理燕景偉昨語記者，該公司業務，以集中我國茶商力量，一致向外推銷爲主。業務中心，目前側重台灣。他如浙江分公司，將設杭州，安徽分公司，將設屯溪。台灣分公司及粗製精製茶廠，業已開設三月，業務正積極推展中。渠稱：政府爲處理卅五年度之存茶計，現已由中央銀行着中國農民銀行，中央信託局，中國茶業聯營公司，及上海茶葉輸出業同業公會，合組一品級評價委員會。該會已聘定中國茶師三人，外籍茶師二人。工作步驟，係先評定各級茶葉價格，然後予以收購。去年度存茶，預計收購額爲美金五百萬元，惟經評價後，估計可收購者，計爲美金一百六十萬元。現將由政府協定一收購價格，予茶商以相當利潤，俾使該項存茶，得以出口。至卅六年收購計劃，本定美金二千五百萬元，茲以祁紅收購時期已過，惟屯綠平綠預計尙可收購約美金一千五百萬元。至本年度茶貸方案，本日（廿日）曾由各關係機關討論一過，各代表以中國農民銀行，現雖擬舉辦茶貸，而卒無茶商前往申貸，故貸款辦法，有待改良，大致將採用貸款代製辦法。計劃中茶貸浙皖贛約佔一千億元，兩湖福建約佔一千億元。聞茶商保誰辦法，福建區將由福州茶葉輸出公會保證，兩湖區將由漢口茶葉輸出公會保證，浙皖贛將由上海茶葉輪出公會保證。渠稱：該項茶貸計劃，今日尙將繼續洽商討論云。</p>
<h3>美金債券募銷消息</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：中國銀行所認購之美金公債美金一千萬元，除已付七百五十萬元外，其餘二百五十萬元，由天津繳一百廿七萬元，重慶繳九十八萬元，廈門繳廿二萬元，即日在滬轉帳云。</p>
<h3>六區造紙業要求　放寬木漿輸入配額　工商輔導處擬討論供應問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工商輔導處擬於本週邀集紙廠及報業代表，就報紙供應及其他有關問題召開會議。緣於本月十七日，本市第六區造紙業公會有函一件致工商輔導處，對第二期紙類，及木漿輸入限額核定之四百五十萬美金中，木漿應得之配額，提出五項最低要求：</p>
<p>（一）第一期限額三百四十五萬美元中，木漿爲四十五萬美元，僅爲實際需要量之十分之一。此期限額多出之一百零五萬美元，應全部劃歸木漿。</p>
<p>（二）各紙廠不惜犧牲血本，每月承造白報紙六百噸，以換取報業應得之進口額外匯。查報業第一期進口限額爲八十五萬美元，照現在國外之定價計算，可定三千零八十英噸之白報紙；，故承造六百噸白報紙，可劃得外匯十六萬五千六百美元。此外並應將進口關稅及運費，由報業交付與各廠所定木漿之結匯銀行。</p>
<p>（三）第一期木漿配限中，資委會所屬各紙廠共劃去十萬美元，致六區各廠所得有限；如資委會各廠及其他各地之紙廠不能承造時，第二期不能照例取得。</p>
<p>（四）六區各廠有在上海電力公司供電範圍之外者，每日需停電四小時，及每週停電一兩天，損失甚大。擬請輔導處與上海電力公司交涉，在停電時間內，將電力多供給其他電廠，使各紙廠能縮短因停電而停工之時間，以資提高產量。</p>
<p>（五）如保持每月六百噸之產量，須配得木漿外匯一百五十萬美元，及每月調換報紙計三個月之外匯四十八萬六千八百美元，使各紙廠在五六七三個月內，可訂購七千餘噸之木漿。若不能獲上述之外匯時，則每月供給報紙數量尙待另商。</p>

<h3>莫行惠訪張學良　歸來後在草山賓館的談片</h3>
<p>— 台北十九日航訊本報特派員江暮雲</p>
<p>張學良到台灣，這是去年十一月二日本報在滬首先批露的消息，可是他在台灣的生活情形怎樣，記者兩時探詢，總只是一鱗半爪；即使是一鱗半爪，却也不容透露。</p>
<p>半年來能作爲專訪客的，只有陳儀，楊森和莫德惠。莫氏專程來台看望張氏，並在新竹躭智一週，方於日昨返省都，應魏主席宴後，即暫居草山賓館，記者冒雨驅車前往，作了一小時有半的長談。旅途的　　情緒，顯然已代替了會心的歡快。以網球自娛的張學良（中）與莫德惠（右）趙四小姐及劉專員合影，下角爲張氏題字，署名毅庵，時世六年五月十六日。</p>
<p>「漢卿（還有一個別號是毅庵）是躭在離新竹還需要三小時汽車旅程的井上溫泉。」莫委員說：「井上溫泉，現在改作淸泉鄉，汽車道灣灣曲曲路途崎嶇，這裏亦許海拔近一千尺了。那裏正和草山一樣，蹲在山叢中，可以看得到太平洋，海，那是挺多風的地方，氣候和台北差不多。」　在他的談話裏，記者更瞭解了井上溫泉的環境。那裏原是蕃人區，（日人稱爲高山族）有一個蕃童小學，五六十個學生，由一個高山靑年和一個客家靑年敎師負責，學生們已能講普通國語，唱黨歌。這一個山村裏，只有一所警察療養所，木造平房，日太式，鋪蓆，有玻璃窗，很整潔，只是沒有絲絨地毯等富麗的設備，那裏就是漢卿的居留地。　荒村僻野，沒有任何塲所和店舖，有的是在過去十里的上坪，要不然就是回到二十里的竹東，這兒是工業區，也是鹿塲大山木材的輸出口。沿途可以看到木馬載運着木材，用人力輸運出山。</p>
<p>規律生活　讀書玩球洗澡</p>
<p>記者所最關心的是張氏的生活，莫委員說：「很有規律，也不寂寞！」　每天早上七時起身，上午看書寫字，下午打網球，洗溫泉澡，規律化的生活顯然他的健康比前更好了！　「誰和他玩球呢？」</p>
<p>「有的，趙小姐，還有一位劉專員，以及衛士們！」關於趙四小姐，他補充着說：「趙四小姐名一荻，寫字寫得挺好，讀書剳記都是他抄寫，地爸在民國十一二年間曾做過津浦綫的局長，呌趙什麼的，想不起了。」記者却意想到當去年張氏來台第一天，長官公署某處長招待，席間曾詢及鐵路事，提到他所追求的三小姐，當時曾使張氏有些窘！趙四小姐多大年紀，不知其詳，但她的孩子也已十七歲了！</p>
<p>于鳳至，現在該仍在美國吧，據說他倆有半年沒通過信了。此番張氏託莫委員帶的信，除函謝蔣夫人，孔，宋先生外，還有就是張氏的家信。在天津還有老母在堂呢！</p>
<p>精研明史　頗想開班講學</p>
<p>張氏現在每天所研習的是明史，繼續在貴陽時的研究工作。明朝十二代皇帝的史績，都摘記下來，而且很有心得，很想有個機會能向他所敬佩的史學家領敎。他深信在歷史上最站得住的是學者，學術可以支配人！他開了一個書單，托莫委員設法購買，這三位無疑地是他所崇敬的：　王崇武的明仁宣宗事蹟旁證。　容肇祖的明代思想史。</p>
<p>剪伯贊的論明海外貿易發展；論中國人民反達旦的鬥爭；論南明第二政府的鬥爭；遼寗淪陷以後的明史，論明代的閹官及閹官政治。</p>
<p>同時他很有在山村裏開班講學的意思，他希望入中央研究院，對於軍事政治，他厭倦了，冲淡了，從貴陽移轉到台灣來這一個階段裏，亦許受陽明學說的影饗，思想上極度的轉變，這個轉變，使他的信仰和傾向，轉入於純學術的研究裏去。他希望以學者的姿態出現，揚棄他旣往的生活狀態。</p>
<p>謠傳紛紜　莫氏躊躇不答</p>
<p>提起王陽明，莫委員想起了一副對聯是：　「三敵棲暹，洞古山深含至樂；</p>
<p>一朝覺悟，文經武緯是全」　這是陽明祠內的對聯，沒下款，人們都說是張氏做的，看是他的寫照，但他却否爲。</p>
<p>從二十五年起，張氏受軍法審判後，即由溪口而黃山，湘西，江西，貴州修文，三十三年到息烽，三十五年又到台灣，這其間，莫德惠氏是他唯一的專訪客，客來話舊，新竹山村雖沒電燈，但剪燭談心，却解除了張氏不少愁悶！</p>
<p>山村裏，生活沒有日本化，還是睡的床，張氏愛穿絨衫，黃卡其袴。每天不一定有鷄肉，鷄湯總是有的，好在他幷不講究吃！</p>
<p>因爲上海有很多謠傳是張氏將出任東北某要職，記者以此探詢時，英氏鑄躇久之，他說：這我怎麼回答是好呢？自由，不自由，這問題可給予老者以難題。</p>
<p>台北事變　甘薯苦度五日</p>
<p>台北二三八事變，波動全省，這一個角落裏却沒有騷動。三天以後，他們得到了動亂的確訊，電話不通，但不明究竟。後來蕃人警察勸吿不要下山，於是即以甘薯苦度了五天。</p>
<p>當時他們害怕於暴徒的衝襲，以山崖爲據點，這警察療養所是無法抵抗的。但他們還有實力，更有和他們相處甚善的高山同胞，他們便有恃無恐了！</p>
<p>莫委員說出了他對二二八的看法，但當記者要探問張氏的看法時，他却保持緘默，說：「他的看法，又不同啦！」</p>
<p>莫氏沉緬在懷念裏，精神仍很興奮，相信他這次已有了收穫。他囑記者轉吿京滬友人說，決搭二十三日的中興輪返滬，因爲要出席參政會呢！臨別，他給我們最近和張氏所攝的照片極爲名貴，特製版刋出，以資本報讀者。</p>
<p>福電鐵工廠機工塲之一部　（本報特派記者陳正予書）</p>
<h3>閩省第一大工廠　福電鐵工廠印象</h3>
<p>— 福州廿一日航訊　本報特派記者陳正予</p>
<p>踏進福建省境很不容易看到林立的烟囪與聽到馬達怒吼的聲音。這一塊十二萬方公里的土地，十足是一個靜悄悄的農業社會。假使說工業，只有以標榜「雙手萬能」的手工業作坊作爲點綴。所謂工業之母的機器工廠，則如鳳毛麟角。戰前戰時，福州，厦門，一些合乎工廠法規定的工廠，如馬尾造船廠，福州企業公司鐵工廠，厦門鐵工廠等，而今皆已倒閉，餘下的福電鐵工廠，算是絕無僅有的了，而今，這脆　的唯一的大工廠又巳陷於幾乎無法維持的局勢中，該是値得我們如何警惕呵！</p>
<p>論規模，福電鐵工廠確是福建省內第一大工廠。福建省內所需的各種動力機械，輪機，農產加工機械完全由該廠製造，所以，該廠幾乎成爲福建省內一切機械動力的源泉。記者爲欲明瞭其現狀，特赴福州新港該廠所在地作了數小時的參觀。</p>
<p>福電鐵工廠承造之閩北建甌大錄橋，全長六百呎。</p>
<p>黃金時代令人憧憬</p>
<p>在三十多年前，該廠原爲福州電氣公司附屬的一個機械修理廠，後來，逐漸在德。美兩國買到大批工作母機與許多精密儀器，規模粗具，迨到民國廿三年乃芷式設廠，承接各方訂製各種機械，廿八年春內遷南平，此數年期間，因爲海運的停頓，外貨無從入口，沿海各省工廠又多毀予砲火，該廠乃躍居東南半壁最具規模之大鐵工廠，受閩浙贛湘鄂各省機關之委託，大量製造蒸汽機，水力機，柴油機，木炭機，工作母機，農業機械，橋塔以供戰時需要。軍政部兵工署東南區各兵工分廠所需之動力機及工作母機如刨床，鑽床，宣床，亦全由該廠供應，當時業務盛極一時，聲名遠播，該廠人士到今尤樂於回憶。</p>
<p>艱苦奮鬥　上下同心</p>
<p>據廠長劉棟業向記者表示：福電廠的歷史過程是何等的艱苦，一如整個中國工業的成長。該廠自勝利遷回福州後，營業狀况遠非昔比，修理多於製造，反映於社會經濟，爲百業蕭條之現象，益以物價飛漲之影響，流動資金因貨幣貶値而吿日漸短少，因此，更無力預製各型成品以備出售，只有賴零星修理機件的收益勉爲維持，據劉廠長語記者：該廠最難得之一項資產，即爲具有十餘年而到二三十年經騐之技術員工，因爲工人技術的熟練，其生產品皆能切合標準化，爲各方所稱道。該廠因爲資金的短絀，有欠工資的情事，却向無罷工怠工的風潮，勞資合拍，上下同心，大家憧憬着「烟囪如林立，汽笛如雷鳴」之一日，這種精神，殊屬難能可貴。</p>
<p>今後計劃製造農具</p>
<p>經濟危機日漸嚴重的今日，談工業化似乎還有一段遙遠的過程。促進農村機械化，提高農業生產力，實爲當前要岡。且福建爲多山省份，閩北各溪流匯集閩江下瀉，間西間中溪流則匯九龍江入海，每當春夏之交，　雨節季，下游廣大地域，苦於洪水氾濫，秋季則乾旱缺水，農產受苦甚大。該廠爲適應此楹情辦之需要，擬自本年起大量製造小型動力機，流動灌溉　，抽水機，日式深耕犂和一切農產加工機械如攝米　，磨粉搬，榨油機，製茶　等，以供應農田灌溉與排水及土產加工之用，連請閩省府協助，就農貸項下撥款由該廠製造大批流動灌溉機透過保農集生產合作社貸予農民應用，以增進農事生產，改善福建鉅額糧食入超之現狀。</p>
<p>另而，該廠工程師近根據高級物理學原理大胆試製一種不需燃料的自動動力機，如果能够成功，將足以驚震全球科學界。</p>
<p>五億貸款廠運所繫</p>
<p>該廠旣確定了以農具爲重心的製造業務，面臨第一大問題即爲生產資金之來源，今年三月曾擬具計劃書透過省建設廳向四聯緻處要求畀于生產貸款五億元，作爲實現上項計劃之條件，是否邀准，關繫着廠運的前途。該廠純乃商股組合，向無龐大資金之準備，僅賴營業上之進益以維持，且製造機械，利潤向例微薄，劉廠長很沉痛地與記者談：假使政府不能及時予以貸款上及推銷上之扶助，廠很易在暴風雨中受到摧殘，一且倒閉，不惟今後福建全省沒有一個像樣的工廠，而且，大批技術嫻熟的員工亦將星散，那時再召集已不易，再來救濟也來不及了，與記者歷陳廠方的困難及今後的計劉，娓娓動她。劉氏當邊北大做授多年，有　者的風度，也是一個事業心極張的人。靠了他到各方左走，　持　　的現狀。記者於歸途中默默地想：國家多難，多少工廠不再冒烟了，僅此脆弱的工集已感無法維持，但是，國蒙無論如何窮，應當全力支持一　足以改善民生的工業，工廠是我們的希望，我們的曙光！</p>
<h3>蠶桑實騐保　在蕪湖推動展開</h3>
<p>— 吳興十日快訊　施星火</p>
<p>在十多年前，每當春季，如果有人到吳興的農村中來，一定會感到驚奇：到處都是綠色，一望無際的綠色，到處可以嗅到一種蓬蓬勃勃生長向榮的氣息，這就是桑林，是水鄕農民們最重要的生命綫。</p>
<p>在戰時，敵僞和遊雜摧殘了農民的生命綫，他們爲了不讓桑林掩議我們的遊擊隊，爲了要拿桑樹來當柴燒，又爲了破壞我們農村的富源，不斷地把桑樹砍掉，將密密曆層的桑林砍成光禿禿的荒地。到抗戰勝利以後，根據精密調查的結果，吳興農村的桑樹减少百分之七十以上，單以菱湖一區來說，損失的桑樹不下五百萬棵。</p>
<p>建設協會改進蠶桑</p>
<p>吳興的菱湖區內十二萬左右的居民中間，百分之八十五以上靠着蠶絲生產來維持生活，過去由於蠶絲業的發達，曾經造成菱湖的繁榮，金麒麟，玉麒麟牌子的土絲，在出口貿易史上作過相當光榮的一頁，可是現在，絲業的一落千丈，更形成了菱湖區民衆普遍而深刻的貧困。勝利以後，農民們知道蠶絲的外銷已有了希望，大家很想多養些蠶，但是桑葉，蠶種，蠶具，資金……什麼都不够，仍然無法增產，同時育蠶方法的落後和土絲品質的粗劣，更是兩個極大的陣碍。</p>
<p>菱湖建設協會的農村工作一開頭，就從改進蠶桑做起，在過去一年多的時間中，他們曾經送蠶種，送桑秧，設共育室，派專家下鄕指導，收買桑樹上的害虫，訓練各保育蠶人材，以及貸款，貸種，貸柴炭等等。本年春季，貸發蠶種二萬五千餘張，成立共育室數十處，派出指導員百餘人，可是由於全區的地域太大，人口太多，協會的力量終屬有限，所以蒙受利益的農民數量上雖然很多，而得到的帮助却往往不很大，這是因爲力量過於分散的緣故。</p>
<p>不做土絲不養夏蠶</p>
<p>經過再三的商榷和研究，協會才決定了一個辦法，就是針對當地的實際需要，擇定工作的重點，大處着眼，小處着手，從示範做起，再逐步擴展，直到普及全區，起初他們打算在菱湖區內成立一個「蠶桑實騐鄉」，來推行蠶桑改進工作，後來又考慮到一鄕的人口相當多，意見難于一致，所以決定改爲「實騐保」，第一期先就全區十四鄉鎭中選擇五鄉，五鄉中選擇五保，這五保的蠶戶只要能切實做到「不做土絲不養二養，（即夏蠶將養秋蠶來補救），這兩個條件，就可以享受到許多的利益，譬如優先補種桑秧，設置示範桑塲，舉辦桑地肥料貸款，代訂優良蠶，贈送秋蠶種種，並派員指導，全保蠶戶共同催春共同飼育，代烘繭子不取代價，介紹赴製種塲實習，參加蠶桑人材訓練班，儘先介紹赴絲廠實習等等，同時，爲獎勵農民不做土絲，藉以發展繅絲工業，爭取出口貿易，更規定在蠶戶賣繭時除給予全部代價外，並發給「售繭獎勵證」，載明售繭數量品質，定于農曆去年十二月十五日憑證到協會領取獎勵金，這一項辦法實驗保以外的蠶戶也可以適用，此外爲了使農民便于存儲乾繭，更在菱湖靑樹當裏開了一個倉庫，代他們存備　者抵押。</p>
<p>實騐保內的農民，除了在春桑方面可以享受到上述種種利益以外，協會方面還要替他們辦義務小學每保一校，澈底修理全部坏埂，派巡廻醫療隊診病保健，以及其地修橋舖路救濟孤老貧弱等。</p>
<p>章氏下鄉視察演講</p>
<p>原則泱定之後，協會副理事長章榮初先生，從百忙中抽出時間，帶着這一份豐當的禮物到菱湖來，親自下鄕去訪問和視察。從五月四日到八日這五天中間，冒着大雨，走遍泥潭的阡陌，深入農村的每一角落，這歷菱湖區內十四個鄕鎭，同行者有協會辦事處主任王洗，理事吳淮淸，談運來，靑樹基金團代表倪拜言，蠶桑指導員主任張月仙以及協會職員等十餘人，章氏每到一鄉，就召集保甲長舉行會議，散發吿蠶戶小册子，開會的地點，有時在廟里，有時在鄕公所里，有時在廣塲上，到會的民衆往往達二三萬人之多，幾乎每一農家都有人來參加，老者扶杖撚鬚，嬰孩躱在母懷，都來參加這空前未有盛會。章氏用着懇摯的鄉音，作通俗而切實的演講，農民受益非淺。</p>
<p>蠶種發育情形良好</p>
<p>據蠶桑指導員吿記者，這次協會所發出的蠶種，發育情形都很好，其中尤以日月牌成績更獲得百分之百的成績，照現在的情形看來，只要大蠶期間不生意外，全區蠶農可能增加收益一百億元以上</p>
<p>在章先生的精神感召之下，向協會申請登記加入實騐保的保數達六十四個之多，超過預定的佔數達十二倍以上，章先生爲了不願使登記者失望，以致影響到他們的熱誠，更爲了希望加速完成蠶桑改革工作，很想做到來者不拒，把這六十多個保一律列爲實騐保。這個辦法固然好，可是事實上就算財力和人力都可以有辦法，單以物力一項來說，困難簡題就非常多，尤其是代烘繭子　一個難關更不易打破，因此在　三商討之下，決定採取「每鄕一保」爲原則，第一期的實騐保從五個增加到十一個，另設預備保二十個，本月十一日開過第一次的實騐保代表大會之後，各項工作立刻開始。</p>
<p>實騐計劃三年完成</p>
<p>這是一個嶄新的試騐，也是一種空前的創造，未來的工作必然非當繁盛而且艱鉅。</p>
<p>據專家的估計，這個實騐保計劃，可能在三年之內完成，這計劃完成之後，菱湖全區可能開設十七家繅絲廠，需要男女工人二萬人以上，年產廠絲一萬五千至二萬包，可能換得美金一千萬元以上的外匯。這樣一來，不僅菱湖區內農業工業化的目的可以完全達到，而且這一項蠶絲生產對於整個國家經濟的貢獻，更無可數計。</p>

<h3>黃河修堤　將是一椿奇蹟</h3>
<p>— 鄭州十日航訊　本報記者范世動</p>
<p>有兩件大事在黃河花園口堵口完成以後一定要做的：一是黃泛區的重建，一是黃河下游的復堤工程。本文是說下游復堤問題，所以把第一點劈開不談。本來下游復堤工作，是與堵口工作要配合的，可是堵口工作不能等待，所以先就把它完成，好在目前不是黃河大汛時期，復堤工作遲了一步，還沒有多大關係；可是這只可一遲，而不可再遲，否則大汛一至，就有新花園口，新黃泛區出現的危險了。</p>
<p>黃河全長八千華里，上游兩岸，山脈連綿，是天然的河防；下游南岸從黃河鐵橋側起，北岸從孟縣起，除了極少部份地區有山巒可倚以外，要靠一千二百公里的大堤來欄範黃水到海口去。從前淸咸豐五年起，有百次以上的決口，都是在這下游大堤地段以內，這限前短短九十二年中歷史所說的話，總是不會假的。</p>
<p>自前濟南附近百餘公里的河堤，巳經修築完成十之七八；菏澤以東至濟寗以北的南岸大堤約百公里，及大堤以南的埝約八十五公里，已經國軍收復，也是可以着手修築；其他魯境南岸地區，原在國軍控制之下，修築更是沒有問題。魯修防處決定在五月五日起至六月十五日內將三百多公里的南岸大堤培修一番，同時將堤面及埽壩修正；然後從六月十五日起至七月十五日止險工整理完成。這個工程動員一百萬民工，完成二百萬土方。</p>
<p>說到北岸，多半在共軍的手裏，魯境有六百多公里之內是共軍勢力範圍之內。水利部部長薛篤弼這次來參加花園口合龍典！記者問起他關於北岸共軍修堤的情形，他回答說：聯總顧問塔德和范明德，最近曾經到那裏去了一次，共軍說是動員三十萬民工，在三個星期將北岸大堤修復。</p>
<p>要是這樣的話，這眞是一個奇蹟：政府方面修南堤，共軍方面修北岸，那末黃河的水一定乖乖的再也不敢鬧亂子了。這個奇蹟擴而大之，國家何患乎弱？人民何患乎貧？</p>
<p>要是像魯修防處主任孔令瑢所說：「從鉅野到東平間八十公里之內，還是一片混亂地區，共軍時常出沒，擾亂施工；甚至有些地區，因爲河面寬僅百公尺，共軍的槍彈時常飛到南岸堤的民工頭上來」。又像豫修防處主任蘇冠軍，冀修防處主任齊壽安所說，那兩省北岸河堤各六七十公里都因戰事關係，連接管都成問題，更談不上培修。那末，我們對於修復河堤一點，除了中共是騙取政府一筆修復費以外，（政府已撥四十億交中共修堤之用），還希望有什麼奇蹟出現呢？　事情也不可以單單從悲觀方面去看，共軍對於北岸的大堤的培修可能做事，因爲這是對於共軍也是有利的事，奇蹟也許就在這個夾縫當中出現。可是在這今日軍事行動之下，共軍存着以「我有利，敵亦有利」來復堤，不如以「我有害，敵亦有害」，來掘堤的心思，那是產生另一種的奇蹟了。這結論且慢下，讓這將要到來的黃河大汛去下結論吧！</p>

<h3>清代俳諧文集的作者</h3>
<p>— 子振</p>
<p>淸代嘉慶·道光間，產生了不少俳諧文集，如「文章游戲」，「豈有此理」，「皆大歡喜」等。某氏戰前出版的「瓜豆集」中「常言道」一文曾經介紹過。關於「豈有此理」的作者，他據「皆大歡喜」卷四「韻鶴軒筆談」（下）所說：</p>
<p>「周竹君著「人龜辯」。」及卷二「韻鶴軒雜著」（下）說；</p>
<p>『「豈有此理」者，吾友周氏所著。』二語和「豈有此理」原書對照，認爲周竹君所作。他說：</p>
<p>「可知此書作者爲周竹君，雖此外無可查考，但此類書署名多極詼詭，今乃能知其姓名，亦已難得了。」他所認爲「無可查考」，祗是沒有查考，並非無可考。據我所知，關於「豈有此理」的作者事跡，除了上述以外，也還略可查考。</p>
<p>同治間蘇州葵愚道人汪堃所著「寄蝸殘　」（十六卷，同治壬申自序。）卷一「江南鄉試制藝」條說：</p>
<p>『蘇州周宗泰以方言俚語集成小說一部，板已久毀。曾憶其「江南鄉試制藝」一篇，覺當年情事，宛在目前。」查『更豈有此理」有「江南鄉試制藝」一篇，就是汪堃所指的。又所說「方言俚語」，又是指「更豈有此理」卷三「俗語對」等篇而言。由此可知「更豈有此理「作者是周氏。按原書序文說：</p>
<p>「子一誤再誤，費筆墨而更續更梓，更無謂也。……僕之費筆墨而更續是編也，……』爾且續爾之「更豈有此理」哉。」又可證「豈有此理」和「更豈有此理」出於一人之手，作者都是周氏。那麽，周宗泰也就是周竹君。但汪堃只說周宗泰，「韻鶴軒筆談」也只說周竹君，雖然就所引篇名和原書對照看來，宗泰竹君必是一個人，可是證據還不堅實，必定要有其他證據，才能使人置信</p>
<p>道光間顧祿撰「淸嘉錄」十二卷，叙蘇州歲時風俗，中引詠吳俗風土的詩頗多，常見的有蔡雲「吳歈百絕」和周宗泰「姑蘇竹枝詞」二種。書中引「姑蘇竹枝詞」六首：</p>
<p>「祭掃」（見卷一「上墳」條）「阿彌飯」（見卷四）「跳灶王」「跳鍾馗」「掛錠」「年夜飯」（以上均見卷十二）按「豈有此理」卷四有詩四十首，題「姑蘇四季竹枝詞」。這六首正在其中，但文字却略有出入。這更可證「豈有此理」是周宗泰所作。「淸嘉錄」明題周宗泰，宗泰當是周民的名，竹君是他的字或號。就「豈有此理」和「更豈有此理」前後二集所記年代和他的自叙，也可約略知道周氏的生平。書中所記年代，最早是乾隆十四五年（一七四九—五〇），前集「絳雪齊紀」說：</p>
<p>「己已仲春家君修葺其廢處……庚午春季商諸石工。』又說：</p>
<p>都是回憶兒時的話。其仙又有乾隆五十四年（一七八九見「考」），五十五年（一七九〇，見「游上方山記」）嘉慶三年（一七八九，見「陰陽秀才」）的干支，但無可供查考其生平之處。最遲是嘉慶四年（一七九九）二月（「西山探梅記」），即作序的前數月。</p>
<p>其中涉及他的生平的，只有前集「考」一篇。他說：</p>
<p>「己酉仲春，予與兄赴童子試。」</p>
<p>查已酉是乾隆五十四年（一七八九），這次應童子試大約是試而未售。按錢國祥「三邑諸生譜」（九卷，光緒刊本）卷二，乾隆五十六年辛亥（一七九一）胡宗師科試吳縣攔第十三名，便是周宗泰。可知他確曾入學。又據前集「鄉試題名錄」和後集「江南鄉試制藝」兩篇語氣看來，他也曾應過鄉試。但查陸懋修「長元吳三邑科第譜一（四卷光緒刊本）及盲允源「吳縣志」選舉一表舉人，都沒有周氏的名字，當是試而未售，以諸生終老。道光元年刊的「皆大歡喜」卷三，旣有：「周君殁，其家恐以口過致冥責，遂燬其板」的記載，則周氏的死當在嘉慶間。死後板又被燬，他的遭遇可謂不幸！但這類窮措大秀才，平時姓名不出鄉里，而身後反藉游戲文字的「閒書」以傳，也可說不幸之中大幸了</p>
<p>道光二十四年（一八四四）浙江士紳張鑑呈請銷毀淫書，刊有「勸燬淫書徽信錄」，燬銷書名計一百二十種，內中竟有「豈有此理」，「更豈有此理」二種。同治七年（一八六八）江蘇巡撫丁日昌查禁淫詞小說書目（見同治「江蘇省例」）首批一百二十種中，也有這兩部。但燬禁書目所列，大抵據書名定取捨，並不顧及內容，這兩部列入查禁之中大約是因書名詼諧詭　所致吧。就內容論，這書前後兩集雖有少數不潔的文字，但也逈非猥褻小說的一流，其中且有幾篇饒有文學風味的。把俳諧文集視爲小說，已無理由可說；又認爲淫書，更是莫明其妙了！</p>
<p>後集中有「續琵琶記序」，稱；『吾友高君伯陽……出其所著「續琵琶記」示余。』按姚　「今樂考證」著錄（十）有高宗元的「續琵琶記」，「新增南西廂」，「改增王簪」戲曲三種。又說：「宗元字伯揚，山陰人，一字求論居士。」「續琵琶」一種，又見梁廷柟「藤花曲話」卷四，謂：『吳榖人（錫麒）爲之序。」這部傳奇僅戰前燕京大學圖書館藏有一部，餘未見他人藏本、這書中存原序一篇，也頗可喜了。</p>
<p>至於「韻鶴軒雜著」所稱許的「混堂記」，見「豈有此理」卷一。其文云：</p>
<p>「　大石爲池，穹幕以磚，鑿與池通，轆轤引水，穴壁而貯焉，析薪然火，頃成沸湯。男子被不潔者，膚垢膩者，負販屠沽者，痬者，花者，　者，納錢於主人，皆得入澡焉。旦及暮，絡繹而至，不可勝許。蹴之則泥滓可掬，腥羶臊穢，不可嚮邇。爲士者間亦蹈之。彼豈不知污耶？迷於其稱耶？習於俗而不知怪耶？抑被不潔虜垢膩者負販屠沽者瘍者疕者　者，果不相浼耶？抑溺於中老目不見，鼻不聞，心慣憒而不知臭耶？倘使去薪沃釜，與溝瀆之水何異焉，人孰從趨之——趨其熟也。烏呼！彼之所謂堂者，吾見其混而已矣。』</p>
<p>其文確峬峭可喜，然而却不是周宗泰的手筆，而是掇錄明人之作。按原文見郎瑛『七修類稿」卷十六『義取類」『混堂』條：</p>
<p>『混堂，天下有之，杭最下焉。有好事者，借喻爲記，頗得　規之義，錄以告不知恥者。記云：</p>
<p>「吳俗：　大石爲池。穹幕以磚，後爲巨釜，令與池通，轆驢引水，穴壁而貯焉。一人專執　，池水相吞，遂成沸湯。名曰混堂，榜其門則日香水。男子被不潔者，膚垢膩者，負販屠沽者，瘍者，疕者，納一錢於主人，皆得入澡焉。旦及暮，袒裼裸裎而來者，不可勝計。茍蹴之則泥滓可掬，臭其體，穢氣不可聞，爲士者亦浴之。彼豈不知污耶？迷於其稱耶？習於俗而不知怪耶？抑被不潔者膚垢膩者負販屠沽老痬者化者果不相浼耶？抑經其浴者目不見，鼻不聞耶？鳴呼！趨其熱而已也。使去薪沃釜、與溝瀆之水何殊焉？人孰趨之哉！」「（文中頗有與周文相異處。）</p>
<p>兩相對照，據錄之跡　然，更易的地方，也並不很多。可知「豈有此理」二集不盡是周民之作，也有　　舊文的。</p>

<h3>江南春草</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>江南的春天，來得早去得也遲；在這暮春時候，春草是更綠了。「白雲依靜渚，芳草閉閒門，」這裏的春草，正如這般的悠閒自在地點綴着江南濃艷的春天，也裝飾着人們平靜的春夢</p>
<p>然而，一繁華事散逐香塵，流水無情草自春，」世事與春景，畢竟是有着不短的距離；夢總歸是幻境，而我們對人情世事的鞭策，始終是不能逃避。今早，推窗看碧綠茂密的郊野，已經是草長沒徑，這使我內心生了一種異樣的感覺；看春將去，自己雖不至於到「芳心向春盡，所得是沾衣」的程度，然從心底漸漸升起來的一縷莫名的感喟，仍不能壓制下</p>
<p>年來，每年我在不同的地方踱過了春天；行足飄忽，窮愁潦倒，自己幾乎沒有片刻感到安寗。一年一度換上新裝的春草，在我眼中所看到的，也已蒙上了一層慘淡灰白的顏色。作孩子的時候，對春天的想望，是歡欣和帶着一份跳躍進取的情緒。但是，現在春天所給與我的感覺，已由活潑跳躍的心情，變成一種沉重的壓抑了！</p>
<p>去年春天，在嘉陵江邊，看長在川地肥沃的咖啡紅色的土地上的春草，那遍地靑葱的光澤，表現着春的飽滿和富裕。那時是初春，我便在計算着趕到江南，看看富有誘惑力的江南的春色；滿以爲能離開巴山後，使可以很安靜來到江南了。可是，反在漫長的復員路上，又重　三十四年春天由西南逃難入川時的流浪痛苦。正當如夢般恍惚地到了江南後，現實的困苦和加在自己生活上更多的艱難，早已使我失去欣賞江南春草的閒情了。</p>
<p>的確，江南的春草，原是特別纖長柔美的，襯貼在蔚藍明澄的天底下；和風徐來，隨風掀起綠色的波浪，輕逸迤　，蘊藏着無窮的雅緻。然而可惜的，是因爲她們生長在這樣多難的大地上；過去在殘酷的戰爭，與敵人的洗刦中，不知染過了多少次人民被殺戮慘死的血腥；而今，縱魚米之鄉的地區，也到處是凋敝飢饉，雖然春草年年春來新綠，茂密依然，可是，這些春春草，早已爲人們所遺棄了！</p>
<p>歷史是演着悲劇：飢饉，恐怖，死亡，在擴大着。春神將要收攏了她疲倦了的翅膀，在寂寞的原野上，春草該是在那邊涰泣吧？</p>
<p>我想起了白居易的名句：「離離原上草，一歲一枯榮，野火燒不盡，春風吹又生。」這是說明在亂世中一點尚存的人生的元氣。人生的坎坷多得很呢，而我們企求的也就是這一點微的倔強！</p>

<h3>埃及底峨席門第亞士</h3>
<p>— 英雪萊作　真勤試譯</p>
<p>我遇到一個從古國來的旅人，他說：兩根沒有身軀的石頭巨腿站在瀚海裏。在沙漠上，靠近它　，半陷着一具破損的臉，上面的皺　，捲唇，和嚴竣的命令底冷笑，顯出彫刻它的人曾經仔細研究過這些情緒，把它們鑿刻在死的石頭上，傳留到今朝，而摩刻它們的手和培養它們的心平已死去：又在座脚上發現了這些字跡：「我底名字是峨席門第亞士，王中之王：大神呵，請看我底勳業，和絕望！』此外更無他物。在這巨大的遣跡底四周，一望無際，莽蒼蒼，寂寞的平沙伸展向遠方。</p>
<p>〔這首十四行詩是雪萊傑作之一，初次發表於一八一八年。峨席門第亞士（Ozymandias）據說是紀元前二一〇〇年頃埃及第一個好戰的君王，曾侵入亞細亞洲。據浮勒（Fowler）指出，詩中所云座脚上所刻的字，是埃及象形文字，在雪萊時代尚fq　人明瞭其意義，直至一八二二年始有張波令（Champollion）者探得該種文字之奧秘云。——譯者」</p>
<h3>記雲隱樓畫室</h3>
<p>— 孫福熙</p>
<p>汪亞塵之名，婦孺皆知，汪亞塵之畫，婦孺皆識，爲何汪先生的畫如此聞名，爲何又如此受人歡迎，這就是我所欲介紹的理由。</p>
<p>他的畫是當代作家中最大衆化的，一切題材，一切方法，以及一切形式與精神，恰巧適合中國長大多數人的性情與需要，甚且東方的日本人，印度人，西方的英法人，美國人，也是一見傾心。這一個結果，在藝術上雖不算是很高的造詣，但是一個很難能可貴的成就。尤其是在中國教育不普及，政治竭力注意大衆化的現時代，藝術的大衆化是更加難能可貴了。</p>
<p>說到這大衆化藝術的來歷，不得不吧他所住的「雲隱樓」說一說。</p>
<p>雲隱樓是　法租界的一所弄堂房子，地點雖頗淸靜，究竟是一個里弄，進門有高大的棕櫚一樹，但院子之小，不能再有其他花木。室內四壁多書架，此外滿是古今字盡。亞塵留學日本，又與其夫人同遊法蘭西意大利，旣愛好古盡，又研究新法，對於新舊並重，奄無成見。對朋友，不論老幼高下，三教九流，一體來往，不偏袒　，亦不攻擎　，這是造成他普徧化大衆化的原因，也是夫人囊助之功。所以文藝界人士即以雲隱樓為聚會中心了。</p>
<p>窗口有一張大畫桌，桌上紙筆硯台水盂顏料，全整齊備，水盂中水常淸，一塊好硯台，磨三轉即出墨很多，顏料盅從不乾燥，隨時　水，如灌花一樣。他就每天在桌邊作畫，凡能畫的人到來，必被勸展紙揮毫。因此，他受人的影響很多，而影響他人者亦不少，所以，花烏草蟲山水以至仕女，他無有不畫。爐架上有古銅雕刻鯉魚，桌後有四面玻璃的魚籠，中蓄金魚，故畫魚更多心得。其他瓶花籠烏，時亦應用以作寫生對象。當代畫家都到過這雲隱樓晝室，也都在雲隱樓酒酣畫興勃發而揮毫。這是值得紀念的地點，—還有一件事是就在雲隱樓他購藏現代作家白石悲鴻大千等名貴作品約二百件之多。</p>
<p>亞麗展覽會中，你於欣賞之餘，再讀此文，如果你沒有到過雲隱樓，到過的更好，這一點記載可使你增加欣賞的意味不少。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血514</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>那位古怪小姐，雖然不懂日本語，看見鶴見接了電話之後，有些失魂落魄的樣兒，知道這電話內容，並不佳妙，便不再追問他「到底是中國人還是日本人」，　提出了另外一個問題：</p>
<p>「對不起，古先生，我哥哥說您是一位冒着三重危險，替國家效命的英雄，可是我倒有些奇怪，您在這三重危險裏，到底是怎麽個存在的？：我是說，用什麼方法，呌人家讓您活動？」</p>
<p>「哦」，鶴見心裏，被剛來的電話消息，攪得如同一盤亂絲，怎麼也捉不住一個頭緒來料理。要是來人是李明，守一，正岩，或那位韓國靑年志士，却還是個適當對象，可以把這些惡劣消息，討論一下，也許不致這等一籌莫展，偏生來的是這們一們魔總的小姐，她又偏生接二連三發出這等古怪疑問，無法一時解答淸楚。並且到目前爲止，鶴見還始終不知她究竟姓什名誰，她的令兄究竟是否百忍莊的守一，所以縱想答覆，也不能不稍稍有些顧忌</p>
<p>「恐怕您對於我這兩個問題，不　解　吧？」這位小姐顯然有些不高興了，」可是還有一個問題，您必得明白賜教，不然的話，我竟是白跑這一趟了……！」</p>
<p>「小姐」，鶴見縐起了一雙劍眉，「我願意答覆您任何疑問，只恨小姐來的不巧，竟碰到我遭到嚴重困難的時候，現在我又收到了最不利的消息，心思亂得很；並且小姐所提出的這兩個問題，不是三言兩語說得淸楚的。小姐設如是守一兄的令妹，他將來必能替鄙人答覆，並且比較鄙人自己答覆還要有力量……」</p>
<p>「那倒沒有關係」；這「關係」二字，想必是這位小姐的口語。「我現在所要問的，恐怕只有您先生可以答覆—我想請您說一說，—您同來的那位日本小姐，她呌什麽萍子吧，我現在就要知道她怎麽個長像，臉上可有什麼特別記認……有麻子？：疤子？…癬眼？歪嘴？…塌山根？…譬如說，一見面就可認識，辯別的特別記認？</p>
<p>「哦：這個…我也說不淸。…大概她長得很淸秀，是個…鵝蛋臉鳳，…櫻桃嘴吧，…左邊臉頰上，一笑就有一個小圓洞洞吧…通關鼻樑，有些像西洋人，可不是畏得那們挺高挺高，一</p>
<p>鶴見把積年學來的北平話關於描書面貌的詞句，大概都用上了，有些枯竭的勢頭；再想說得明白些，確定些，無奈語彙不够，而且也眞無法說　萍子究竟如何長像。他默想了一會，才猛然想起一個特點：「她一開口說話，先帶三分笑意；一着　，馬上就會傷心流淚…</p>
<p>這位古怪小如，來得那們突兀，走得也那們匆遽。只見她聽究了鶴見最後那句話，再也不找下文，陡地離座站了起來，略一點首；「再見」兩字還未說完，人已開門去了，並且把門隨手帶上。</p>
<p>鶴見剛想趕出門外送別，全始全終演出一　紳士作風，無奈恰巧又有電話來了</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>英國羅伯特，彭思的詩，向來爲我所愛好。前年在重慶曾讀到袁水拍先生的一本譯詩「我的心呀在高原」，書內有半數以上是彭思的小詩。譯筆好極了。尤其是那篇前記寫得好。</p>
<p>他開始就提到卓別麟。他說：</p>
<p>卓別鹿特別喜歡描寫一個流浪人和人個身體比他大兩三倍的，和他說話須要把彎腰下去的警察。這個弱小者的流浪者雖則在充滿了冷酷和敵意的世界中打了幾十年滾，依舊沒有失掉天眞的童心。在某一張影片中，卓別麟想和一個痛恨他的漢子和解、他滿悽好意走上去，要和這嚴戲的漢子攀談，一面右手還握着一束花朶，藏在身背後，笑客滿面正待送給那人，不料馬上一個大拳頭打過來，卓別麟應聲倒地，那一束花朶還沒有被看見，就在地上壓爛了。</p>
<p>在這市儈的十里洋塲，正多着像這同一類型的故意。如果有花送人，千萬不可藏在背後，這「進步」的社會像商塲，像交易所，是沒有什麽「人情」乃至於「幽默」可言的。如果無花送人，也不妨佯作送花狀。因爲這年頭人與人之問的尊敬，十之八九離不了是「欺騙」。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>兒童的早熟</h3>
<p>— 虛舟</p>
<p>在人妖案，逆倫案，鷄姦案等觸目的新聞以外，也自然可能有這樣的新聞的</p>
<p>「（××訊〕本市住民陳某之子，年十四歲，月前一度携款十二萬元，與同學多人離家求仙，幸其父得悉較早，業經尋回。不料日昨又復遠遁，並留書一封，內稱：「不滿現實社會，故別家拜師他去求仙」。……」</p>
<p>在奇特多變的社會中，孩子也早熟起來了。一個十三的女孩，已有被姦的資格，則一個十四歲的男孩，拯世乏力，自救不暇，又看了太多的「火燒紅蓮寺」之類，自然會有離家求仙去的怪想。戰前戰後，關於報導孩童求仙的新聞，我們已看得很多，不足爲奇，不過這回的「陳某之子」却是口口聲聲因「不滿現實」而出走的，所以不免教人有點驚訝。</p>
<p>不滿現實的人多矣，有的　言，有的佯狂，有的「今朝有　今朝醉」，有的「我不入地獄誰入地獄」，也有的是認爲戲塲小天地，天地大戲塲，戴上臉譜，何妨橫行？我就很少看到成人中竟肯那麽認眞地棄家出走，說是要求仙，要拯世的。人世經騐一多，「求仙」之類的想法自不免太天眞了些，可是同時也就失去了那點童心不滿現實是一回事，在現實中隨世俗以浮沉則又是一回事。魯迅先生言云：「經騐所得的結果，無論好壞，都要很犬的犧性、雖是小事情，也免不掉要付很大的代價。」（南腔北調集）是的，人類的經騐越多，所喪失的勇氣往往也越大。垂老而戰鬥力勇者，在人們中百不得一，因此這些勇者也往往是人類的精英，花朵。</p>
<p>在目前，目所見耳所聞，難得有幾個好新聞。孩子照例是「與世無爭」的，大多是應該在無憂無慮地享受他們的童年生活的，可是不然，兒童節前後，上海普善山莊不是埋葬了數百名童屍麼？其中不是還演了一塲「劈棄棺」的戲劇麼。廣州一帶，不是竟發現了大批童匪，乘帆船往來行刧麼？杭州童竊之衆多，不是已成爲各報的特寫題材麼？此外如十三歲女被姦，十五歲學生出走「救亡」，等等，無一不說明這個社會的反常。最近上海地方法院第四庭，審判十六歲小竊徐國良，推事反被小竊所窘則尤有傳奇意味。事情是這樣的：當吳推事訊畢後，即擬處以拘役三十天，不料該童聆判後，反以驚奇神態，向法官作懷疑之反問曰：「老爺」我已經被押四十天了。」如果照算的話，法庭方面反而倒欠他拘役十天。</p>
<p>值茲亂世，兒童大抵早熟，所以社會上旣有一二神童，却也更多童匪和童　，兩相對照，多少也反映了現實的一角的吧。</p>

<p>興工年餘的黃河堵復工程，自從三月間在花園口合龍以後，九年來顚沛流離於陝甘鄂諸省的豫籍難民，都紛紛結伴還鄉；據有關當局統計，每天進入汎區的總是在兩千人以上。這些人中以老翁老嫗居多；有撑着竹桿子一步一拐，徒步兩三個月的殘疾者；有當年逃亡時一家長幼俱全，而今單身回來的刧後孑遺；也有一手携籃，一手抱着無父孤兒的堅忍的母親。這些人的隊伍迤邐行中進着，担負着長期流亡生活經受的恩怨創痛，捱着旅途風雨的吹打與飢餓之苦，有如回教徒麥加朝聖的虔誠心境，一步一趨向故鄉走去。</p>
<p>九年了！九年不是一段短促的時光，九年間的風波譎幻眞是驚人呵！當年市塵櫛比的鎭店，現在平坦坦的一無所有了；當年朝夕使用的牛車，當年好幾代住過的瓦房茅棚，當年辛苦栽植的柿樹林，也都沒入平沙無垠中了，故鄉究竟在那裏呵？然而故鄉的泥土是可親的，有千千萬萬的歸來人，業已尋到自家田園盧舍的舊址，在那裏重新打實了地基，搭起來草棚；把五榖的種籽下種了，把昨日的也是明日的希望一道種下去。</p>
<p>民國三十二年夏，我由開封以南偸渡黃河，間道入陝，中途橫跨三十里黃汎區，極目四囑，蘆葦蓬蒿叢生，其高過丈，其廣無涯，勁風掠過，如鬼哭，如神　。路闢蘆蒿穿梭進，荊棘刺膝，沙石沒脛；而昔日之村樹摟舍牌坊，亦僅見其梢巔屋脊及貞節坊字樣浮出地面而已。俯首黃沙蔓草之下，眞不知有多少生命財產埋葬其中。然而九年滄桑之後，生自這方土地的兒女們今日歸來了。</p>
<p>除了懇切的祝福外，我還再說些什麼呢？</p>
<h3>如何教導你的孩子——告訴你幾個好榜樣</h3>
<p>— 夢麟譯</p>
<p>（一）紅花瓶</p>
<p>一對兄弟，傑昂和愛德華，常常並且很利害地爭論着，每個人都自始至終訴說對方是完全錯的，有一天他倆熱烈的爭辯偶然給父親聽見了，他將兩人呌進了書房，使他們面坐在桌子的兩頭。在爐架上拿下了一只紅的玻璃花瓶，瓶的一面是有着一朶白玫瑰的花飾。他將花瓶放在桌子的中央，然後對傑昂說：「告訴我你看見了什麽？」</p>
<p>「我看見一只紅花瓶。」傑昂回答。</p>
<p>「我在告訴我，你看到了些什麽？」他轉向着愛德華。</p>
<p>「我看見一只紅花瓶，瓶上有一朶白玫瑰。」愛回答：</p>
<p>「很好，孩子們，這樣就對了！」父親說。</p>
<p>孩子們已懂得父親的意思，以後每逢跟別人意見相左到幾乎演變成無結果的爭論時，他們便記得了紅花瓶的說教，重明白這完全不過是觀點上的不同。</p>
<p>（二）張開的手掌</p>
<p>我十歲的時候，在學校女生堆中，找到了我第一個眞眞的「遊侶」，兩人間的友誼變成了我最關心的事情，因爲佔有慾的關係，祗要某一次她的遊興而沒有我的份兒，我便覺得十分妒恨着她。對於這種態度、我並不隱瞞着她，結果當然引起了她的討厭。</p>
<p>媽媽明白着一切的發展。有一天我們正觀慕着幾只小鷄，我揀中了一只，將他緊緊的捉住，幾乎使他透不過氣來。他掙扎着想逃脫！結果立刻給他逃走了。媽媽隨便的說，「假如你將一只小鷄捉得太緊，他祗想逃脫了，試試看，捉得輕鬆點。」</p>
<p>第二只小鷄果然安靜地蹲在我坦開着的手掌上了。媽媽慈祥地接着說，「你得明白，寶貝，人類跟小鷄一樣，假使我們將所心愛的人也太親切的管束着，他們便要爲求自己的自由而爭鬥了。坦張着我們的手掌去愛護他們，他們便不會感到窒息了。」</p>
<p>這教訓是有益的，以後雖然有時候我還是感到嫉妒，但是祗要腦海裏一映演出一只小鷄知足地蹲在我手掌上的一幕，我便不會得把它表露在面上了。</p>
<h3>泛論音樂文化</h3>
<p>— 聲和</p>
<p>音樂藝術是文化的一環，在其陶冶精神與美化生活的效能上講，且是文化中頗爲重要的一個部門。我國音樂落後，近二十年來雖稍有進步，但若與世界各國的音樂爭一短長，則相去甚遠，仍待最大的努力。</p>
<p>推究落後的原因很多，如人才的缺乏，樂教的衰微，心理的忽視，樂器的仰求舶來品，……筆者認爲最大的原因還是音樂文化，未能發揚光大。音樂文化關係香樂藝術的進展實爲至鉅，不可忽視。</p>
<p>音樂文化至少包括下列三個主要的項目：</p>
<p>（一）音樂創作</p>
<p>（二）音樂評論</p>
<p>（三）音樂出版事業</p>
<p>上述三項，是音樂文化中極重要的部門，而且應該平均地發展，相輔進行，才能收到很大的效果。今日中國的音樂人才，日見增加，其中作曲人才，亦並不十分貧乏，雖有創作·但並不多，如何鼓勵中國音樂作品（包括聲樂器樂）的創作蓬勃，且普遍地推荐介紹，實爲發展中國音樂文化的首要急務。其次，建立音樂評論，亦屬至要。我們在報章雜誌上，常看見影評，劇評，獨少樂評（恕我杜造這一個名詞）；即使有一兩篇批評音樂演奏會的文字，但都談不上批評，祇是些感想而已。音樂評論家並不一定是音樂家，但至少對於欣賞能力，音樂知識及樂曲理解各方面都有相當修養，始能勝任愉快。談到中國音樂出版事業、更是貧乏得可憐了！據筆者所知，目前關於音樂理論書籍及樂曲的出版，幾等於無；而够得上水準的定期音樂刊物，全國不上十種，旦均因經費，印刷種種困難，時而夭折，時而脫期。</p>
<p>要想發展中國音樂文化，不能不向上述三種目標去努力，單靠音樂界和關心愛好音樂人士的力量是不够的，實賴於政府當局以遠大的眼光和決心去熱心地資助和倡導了。</p>
<h3>聽曲記</h3>
<p>— 石</p>
<p>昨於收音機畔，聆余派鬚生陳大濩歌大保國三段，味甚雋永。按此劇之後半即爲二　宮。　年名家如譚余等人僅演進宮而不演保國，所以故者，並非不能讀唱，蓋以此劇除人物多一李良外，其編寫與二進宮並無大殊，加之舊本詞句俚俗，去劇中人榻波身份甚遠，伶人旣不工文　，不敢擅自改刪，　放棄不演。後言菊朋來滬貼演此劇由「大保國」起演至「二進宮』止，中間尚有一齣「嘆皇陵」插入；其用意無非將小戲化成大戲後，多添些號召力而已不意此戲，一演而紅，名伶如譚宮英，楊實森，李宗義等乃羣起演唱，然均依照舊本搬演，名家之唱句雖有出入，惟大致相同，昨聆大濩歌此與諸伶逈異其趣，不僅詞意典雅通順，且能表出大臣之身份口吻。腔調亦多新穎特出者，前後無一句雷同，每一唱腔均能充分發揮詞句之情緒，茍非經苦心硺磨萬難臻此。</p>

<h3>草的神妙</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>報載北非發現一羚羊人，他一小時可以跑五十英哩，這將使世運會上長跑健將爲之失色了。又據說他的主要食料是草，這是有可信的理由的。</p>
<p>科學家幾年前就發現上一磅乾草中所含的「維他命A」較明蘿蔔含量多二十三倍，「維他命B1」較蔬菜多九倍「維他命B2」較生菜（LEttuce）多二十二倍，「維他命C」較番茄多十四倍。另外苜蓿粉中含有充分的止血的「維他命K」和蛋白質，但是一般人却要從肝臟和蔬菜中去尋找「維他命K」。因爲「維他命K」能預防視網膜出血而失明，更可以補救婦女月經失調及胃潰瘍等病症。</p>
<p>美國化學年會上曾有一著名科學家宣稱，人們若採用大麥燕麥葉子製成的粉，食後一冬不患傷風。他又提議每年每人只用十二磅草粉，就得到足够的營養料。現在美國就有專製草粉的工廠，以備家庭採用。</p>
<p>這個羚羊人其所以有這樣的跑速，無疑他是得到草的營養的，其實在耶穌紀元五世紀前巴比侖王凱尼莎攻破耶路撒冷後就有三個月沒有軍糧，專吃草過活的。不過現在因人類進步了，反而忘了自然界的草還含有這樣寶貴的營養料。</p>

<p>蘇東坡被譎手！居士本來無，大概也不在少黃州的時候，曾垢！」個中寓意　數罷！雖然有人做過一首擦背歌。不僅是深刻，想擦它們的背，，歌道：「水垢　蘇老的借題發揮　但它們老是司空何曾相受？細看輕，大概是另有見慣，毫不在乎兩俱無。有寄語所指。　。比之胆小的坡擦背人，盡日勞我們試看今翁，的確要强得君揮肘，輕手！　日背膚藏垢的人　多哩！</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「周太太，你下來再說！你下來再說！」那個瘦長條子的駕駛員也漸漸感到了這件事的嚴重性，便自己走上去，向那胖女人勸說；可是他還想多少給自己保留一些威風，所以口氣並不太軟。</p>
<p>這兩句話就像一大桶汽油潑到了火上去。那胖女人閃電似的打不知道那一個衣包裏抽出了一柄雪亮的剪刀來。</p>
<p>「你們打算斯負女人，是不是？」她把自己那半截粗壯的身軀堵塞了整個的車門，右手緊握剪刀，左手抓住了車座的靠背，怒自圓睛地看定了地上所有的站着的人。「不行！不行！老子是不下車的！』她又特別向那司機盯了一眼。「你們還有良心嗎？老子的三兩金子不是天上掉下來的！那個要我下車，我就跟他拼命！」</p>
<p>她簡直像殺猪似的大喊，幾乎把這塊空地上的人全驚動了。</p>
<p>「眞精彩！眞精彩！」存着隔岸觀火心理的張昌禁不住喝起彩來，一而還教　緋學着他的樣，不住的拍手。</p>
<p>進退維谷的熊處長惡狠狠地回頭瞪了他一眼，他只當沒有瞧見。</p>
<p>「鄧國忠，他媽的！你還呆着幹什麽？」現在，劉連長也覺得這件事鬧得太不成話了，一伸手就打了那司機一嘴吧。」還不快滾過去？跟王士雄他們商量商量，不論誰的司機合都行！讓一個坐位給她，我們九點鐘一定要開車！』</p>
<p>鄭國忠哭喪着臉，像一條狗一樣的打人叢裏竄了出去。</p>
<p>年少的熊處長還得假作從容地跟那持乎杖的中年人竭力敷衍着；他覺得爲了這個混賬的司機，自己今天眞是顏面掃地了</p>
<p>不料劉連長的一番苦心還不能獲得那個矮胖的湖南女人的諒解，她用兩支穿着方頭黑牛皮鞋的大脚在司機台上大跳大蹬，一路拉開了嗓子狂喊；</p>
<p>「不成！不成！老于一定要坐這一個車！老子的行李都在這車上，你們想支開老子！別做夢！老子……』</p>
<p>看熱鬧的人立刻笑成了一片。</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Speech at the Assembly Stating Determination to Seek Peace: The Government Still Willing to Resolve National Affairs Politically</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The fourth session, third meeting of the National Political Council (參政會), opened at 10:15 AM on the 20th at the National Assembly Hall. Chairman Chiang and Chairman Zhang Boling of the National Political Council Presidium entered the assembly platform simultaneously amidst the resounding military music. Two hundred and thirty-six Council members were present. Over forty heads of government agencies were invited to attend, including Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, Zhang Ji, Zhou Zhongyue, Zhang Jia, Weng Wenhao, Yu Jiaju, Wu Dingchang, Chen Burei, and Wu Tiecheng. After Chairman Zhang Boling presided over the ceremony with due formality, he delivered the opening address. This was followed by an address from Chairman Chiang of the National Government, who first expressed his gratitude to the Council for its significant contributions to the government during the war and the recovery period. He then stated that the government, in order to achieve social peace and national construction, had sought peace with the utmost patience, but it had been repeatedly undermined by the Communist Party. However, the government's determination to achieve political democratization and nationalization of the military would not be interrupted by the Communist Party's obstruction. If the Communist Party were to abandon its attempt to seize power by force and implement all previously reached agreements, the government would still resolve national affairs through political means.

<h3>Zhang Boling's Opening Address</h3>
<p>[China News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The third session of the fourth National Political Council opened on the 20th. Chairman Zhang Boling delivered the following opening address: "Today is the day of the third session of the fourth National Political Council. It is with immense pleasure that I, Boling, reunite with my colleagues. Recalling that since the establishment of this Council, nine years have passed and over twelve meetings have been held. Except for the last time when I was unable to attend due to illness, I have participated in all of them. I am fortunate to have recovered and have the opportunity to participate again, and I would like to briefly share my personal thoughts with all of you for your consideration. The reason for the establishment of this Council was that the government decided on the national policy of resisting Japan, which required national unity, sincerity, and solidarity, to concentrate strength and will in order to achieve ultimate victory. During the war of resistance, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, soldiers sacrificed their lives and shed blood for the country, and the people of the whole country endured hardship and suffering. Finally, we were able to overcome the powerful enemy and restore our land. The colleagues of this Council, with the spirit of sharing weal and woe, spoke freely and exhaustively on the government's major policies and matters that should be promoted or reformed. I believe that within the scope of our authority, we have made our utmost efforts. The National Political Council is indeed a glorious page in the history of the war of resistance. For the first sixty years of my life, Boling spent almost entirely in national humiliation and disaster. I personally experienced these national humiliations and disasters, and I feel deeply pained. I believe that colleagues who are slightly older than me feel the same way. Boling grew up in Tianjin. The old concessions of Tianjin were the concrete manifestation of unequal treaties and the source of all evil. Chinese people living in the concessions could gradually forget that they were Chinese. As long as there were concessions, China could not stand up. But now, the invading enemy has been defeated, the concessions have been recovered, and the unequal treaties have been abolished. From now on, China can be as good as it wants to be, without any restrictions or obstacles. China has gained freedom.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Boling recently returned from abroad and observed the international situation. Although there are still many unresolved disputes, avoiding war and seeking peace is the unanimous wish of the great powers. China's position in the international arena, some say, is declining again, and its responsibility lies in the world's problems. China's opinions are still valued. Regarding China's own problems, we oppose international intervention, and the international community cannot interfere. This is incomparable to the past when foreigners in China could take whatever they wanted and arbitrarily divide spheres of influence. China's position is much higher than it was ten, twenty, thirty, or forty years ago. China's current position in the international arena is at a peak that has not been seen in the past fifty years. China has gained equality.</p>
<p>Therefore, looking back at the past and looking forward to the future, from a broad perspective and a long-term perspective, China's future is truly bright. The current difficulties are inevitable, but the brightness of the future is beyond doubt!</p>
<p>The reason why the current difficulties cause people to be depressed or even disappointed is that our hopes are too extravagant. Victory came too quickly. We were not prepared, and victory came. Our efforts were not enough, and we won victory. We did not drive the enemy out of the country, and the enemy surrendered. This victory was too cheap. Cheap victory has given us many wrong perceptions and delusions. We thought that because we won, our efforts must have been enough, and our efforts were enough to exchange for victory. This is a mistake in perception. We thought that after victory, everything would be solved easily without any effort, and the fruits of victory would come naturally. We thought that peace and prosperity after victory could be obtained easily. We thought that since the war of resistance had been won, the work of recovery would not be troublesome, and the work of national construction would naturally begin. We thought that since we could resist foreign aggression, we could definitely maintain domestic stability. These are all our delusions. At the beginning of the victory, Boling was also one of the delusional ones. Now I realize my mistake. The cheap victory led to delusions and extravagant hopes, and extravagant hopes led to disappointment, because victory came cheaply, and we felt that the current difficulties were unexpected.</p>
<p>The current difficulties are indeed serious. The most serious is the economic difficulty, and the main reason for the economic difficulty is that everyone thinks it is due to the domestic war. The country needs unification, but there is armed conflict within the country. The people need stability, but what exists is only disturbance and chaos. It is the duty of the state to seek the welfare of the people. If the domestic war continues, the people will not be able to survive. This is the reality. Therefore, domestic peace has become the most urgent issue. The responsibility of the National Political Council is to express public opinion and advise the government. Boling believes that we can take domestic peace as the theme of this meeting, discuss the issue of peace extensively and thoroughly, speak out as much as possible about the facts related to peace, put forward concrete methods to promote and achieve peace, and make suggestions to the government and announce them to the people based on the results of the discussion. If the efforts of the people of this Council can bring a glimmer of peace to the whole country, then the mission of this Council can be accomplished, and the people of this Council will also have great glory."</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui Returns to Taipei Discussing Zhang Xueliang's Recent Situation: Mo Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow En Route to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 19th] Mo Dehui returned to Taipei from Hsinchu yesterday. He is scheduled to take the Zhongxing Wheel back to Shanghai on the 22nd and then transfer to Nanjing to attend the National Political Council. He went to visit Zhang Xueliang on the 12th and spent seven days with him. According to Mo, Qingquan, where Zhang lives, formerly known as Inoue Hot Spring, is much more secluded than his old residence in Guizhou. His physical and mental condition is also better than in Guizhou. He now gets up at 7:00 AM every morning, spends the entire morning reading, and plays tennis and takes a hot spring bath in the afternoon. Because there are no electric lights in the area, he sleeps very early at night. Mo said that Zhang studies the History of the Ming Dynasty every day, making notes and compiling a table of the emperors of the Ming Dynasty, which he places on his desk. He also said that today's Zhang Xueliang is completely different from the young Marshal Zhang of the past. He now has no interest in military affairs and is very indifferent to politics. He once mentioned casually that he would like to emulate Wang Yangming and Zhu Xi in building academies and giving lectures. This may be a momentary thought, but he solemnly stated that he would like to enter the Academia Sinica as a researcher and devote himself to academic research for the rest of his life. Zhang wrote a poem a few days ago, which reads: "Ten years without much illness, old friends have not yet returned, after the flames of war in my remaining years, my only wish is to read." As the saying goes, "There are gold houses in books." Today's Zhang Xueliang has clearly decided to spend the rest of his life with books. Mo also said that Miss Zhao Si's name is Zhao Yidi. Her father once served as the director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau. The rumor that she is the daughter of Zhao Erxun is incorrect. She is now Zhang's assistant and a good friend of Zhang. She helps Zhang copy notes every morning and plays ball with Zhang in the afternoon. There were also many letters entrusted to Mo to bring to Nanjing, including a letter to Chairman Chiang and letters to Song Ziwen and Kong Xiangxi, as well as family letters to Zhang's mother and his wife Yu Fengzhi.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Xiong Shihui, Director of the Northeast Appeasement Headquarters, arrived in Nanjing by plane from Beiping at 2:00 PM on the 20th. It is reported that Xiong's trip is to consult with the central government on countermeasures regarding the situation in the Northeast. He will return to Shenyang within the week.</p>
<h3>Communist Army in the Area East of Mengyin Retreats North in Three Routes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 20th] Wang Yaowu's troops along the Jiaoji Railway, after recovering Mingshui and Zhangqiu on the 19th, continued to mop up eastward, and by the evening of the 20th, they had advanced to the vicinity of Puj. A portion of the Communist army that had been operating in the area of Yishui, Ju County, Mengyin, and Tangquan crossed Lucun, 30 kilometers east of Laiwu, on the morning of the 20th and continued to retreat north.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] The decisive battle in the area east of Mengyin has now come to an end. The Communist army has suffered another disastrous defeat and is retreating north in three routes. The headquarters of the East China Field Army of the Communist army has moved to Yue Village, northwest of Yishui, southwest of Linyi. The National Army, taking advantage of its victory, is also pursuing fiercely in three routes. The central route has crossed the line of Sunzu and is advancing north. The eastern route Communist army is no longer able to hold Ju County and is heading straight for Zhucheng. Ju County will be captured soon. The western route has advanced to Beishidian, 28 kilometers northeast of Xintai, and is engaged in fierce fighting with the remnants of the Communist army in the area of Mashan and the front and rear Gushan.</p>
<h3>Changli County Recovered Communist Army Retreats on Separate Routes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] The National Army on the Beining Railway rushed to Changli yesterday from the east and west along the line. The Communist army resisted for a day. At 10:00 AM on the 20th, the National Army captured Haber Town and the station north of the city. By noon, the county seat was completely recovered. The Communist army suffered heavy casualties and retreated in separate routes to Funing and Leting. The National Army is now taking advantage of the situation to pursue the remaining Communists in the suburbs. The Beining Railway will be restored within days.</p>
<h3>Shenyang Chamber of Commerce Suggests to the National Political Council That the Peace Conference with Japan Should Be Held in Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 20th] The Shenyang Chamber of Commerce believes that the Second World War originated from the September 18th Incident when the Japanese invaders occupied Shenyang. It recently suggested that the government take the initiative in diplomacy and notify all countries that the peace conference with Japan should be held in Shenyang starting on September 18th of this year, so that the world can be warned of the tragic disaster, learn from the past, and seek to revive the Northeast and build a new China. This case has been entrusted to Northeast Council member Wang Huiyi to take to Nanjing. It is requested that Mo Dehui take the lead in submitting it to the National Political Council for a public decision.</p>

<h3>Snippets from the National Political Council</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Zhang Ming</p>
<p>The magnificent National Assembly Hall shines in the morning glow of May, and it makes a sound. Its doors open wide, and today, on this day, it swallows and spews out more than three hundred Council members from all over the country, carrying the will of tens of millions of compatriots. The National Assembly Hall is responsible for expressing public opinion after the National Assembly.</p>
<p>This National Political Council is the twelfth meeting since the General Assembly, the second meeting after the victory, the first meeting after returning to the capital, and the first meeting held in Nanjing. The total number of Council members is 362, and 237 people came today.</p>
<p>The first member of the Presidium to arrive was Wang Shijie, and the second was Wang Yunwu. Before the meeting, Presidium members Zhang Boling, Wu Yifang, and others went from the stage to the back. Two minutes later, they came down one by one, leaving only Elder Zhang, because he is the chairman of today's meeting. Elder Zhang has a pair of black eyes, a tall figure, standing there, despite his old age, he still exudes strong strength, like an immovable appearance.</p>
<p>Bishop Yu Bin, the representative of the Council members who delivered the speech, was wearing a long robe today, with graceful demeanor and very clear speech.</p>
<p>The first government head to arrive was Wu Dingchang, the chief of the Office of the President, and the second was Minister Zhang Lisheng. Chen Burei, a member of the National Government, dressed in a gray Zhongshan suit, quietly went to the registration desk, left his signature, and went to the assembly hall. Chen Lifu came in with a smiling face, his face was red, his hair was white, it really was a combination of red face and white hair.</p>
<p>Zhu Jiaju, wearing a summer suit, very quietly shook hands with the Council members at the meeting.</p>
<p>Female Council member Luo Heng's Zhongshan suit was very straight, a pair of white leather shoes, shaking hands and nodding, quite gentlemanly. Since Chen Yiyun returned from the Pan-Asian Conference, her demeanor has become more elegant, with a large bun, very chic. Poet and Council member Lu Qian, weighing over two hundred pounds, usually wears a Chinese-style silk shirt, but today he is wearing a white suit, black tie, and yellow leather shoes.</p>
<p>On today's meeting order, "bowing three times to the national flag and the portrait of the founding father" was still listed, and when the ceremony was held, the reporter paid special attention, and everyone saluted. The reason is that the tea party yesterday decided to salute the national flag only, without the "portrait of the founding father" in it. At that time, someone objected, thinking that the founding father was listed alongside the national flag, wouldn't the portrait of the founding father have to be avoided when saluting? Moreover, the national flag represents the country, and the founding father founded the Republic of China, there is no difference, so today people from all parties still saluted the founding father.</p>
<p>The entire staff of the National Political Council walked into the National Assembly Hall, but there was still a feeling of emptiness. So the reporters who used to be crowded in the corner when the meeting was held in the auditorium of the Military Affairs Commission in Chongqing, and who could not be accommodated in the National Assembly Hall, sat in the middle today and comfortably enjoyed the right of the Council members to "attend to politics."</p>
<p>The layout of the meeting place is different from that of the National Assembly Hall. There are fewer national flags, and all places where national flags were placed are decorated with national flower patterns. Simple and solemn, the flowers in front of the podium are also reduced. Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Political Council, has repeatedly said "to save," and this time, the decoration of many red tape has been reduced.</p>

<h3>Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Speech at the Opening Ceremony of the National Political Council</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The following is the full text of Chairman Chiang's speech at the opening ceremony of the fourth session, third meeting of the National Political Council on the morning of the 20th:</p>
<p>Fellow Council Members:</p>
<p>Today we are holding the third meeting of the fourth National Political Council. It has been more than a year since the last meeting. Since the government returned to the capital last year, it was initially busy with recovery work. Then, due to the convening of the National Assembly, the supplementary elections of council members from the Northeast and Taiwan provinces and cities, and then the reorganization of the government, it was delayed until today that the General Assembly could be convened. Whether you are long-serving members or newly elected representatives of the people, you have traveled far and wide to gather in the capital and contribute your plans. On behalf of the government, I extend my sincere greetings and welcome to you.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, the National Political Council supported national policies, led the people, and assisted the government, making great contributions to the country. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the colleagues of the National Political Council, in the central government and in local areas, assisted in the progress of recovery work, investigated the reception and disposal of enemy and puppet materials in various places, especially the resident council members, who spared no effort to fulfill their responsibilities and made many contributions to the government. I and my government colleagues express our deep gratitude. The number of council members in this meeting has increased from 290 to 362, and the large number of participants will have a greater effect in pooling ideas. I believe that you will be able to maintain the spirit of the past nine years, do your best to plan for the long-term interests of the country and make honest and frank recommendations to the government, promote the great achievements of the victory of the War of Resistance, and promote the completion of the revival and construction of the country.</p>
<p>After the closing of your last meeting, the difficulties the country has encountered and the suffering the people have endured during this year are well known to you and need not be repeated. During this period, we have always sought the realization of peaceful unification with an unyielding determination. In order to relieve the suffering of the people of the whole country, to eliminate the obstacles to recovery and construction, and to seek the stability of the country and society, we have made continuous efforts with the greatest patience to achieve the requirements of "nationalization of the army" and "democratization of politics". However, the result we got was the Communist Party's firm refusal. The Communist Party refused the consultations of the Five-Person Group and the Three-Person Group, refused to stop the conflict and restore traffic, refused to implement the plan for reorganization and integration of the army, refused to attend the National Assembly and participate in the reorganization of the government, and finally refused the government's suggestion to send personnel to Yan'an to negotiate peace. Our painstaking concessions and the goal of complete reconciliation became a bubble. But our consistent efforts to democratize politics cannot be delayed by the Communist Party's obstruction. The National Assembly was convened in November last year, formulated the Constitution of the Republic of China, and determined the date of implementation of the Constitution. Then, the National Government was reorganized, ending the one-party tutelage. This point can be said to have been realized. The wish of our National Political Council to implement constitutional government for many years can be considered a comfort to the colleagues of your council. After the reorganization of the National Government, we still adhere to the basic policy of resolving the Communist Party issue politically, but whether peaceful unification can be realized depends entirely on the attitude of the Communist Party. We only hope that the Communist Party will abandon its attempt to seize power by force, stop military actions, and restore national traffic. We only hope that they will show their sincerity with facts. The government is always seeking peace and can use political methods to seek a solution to relieve the people from their suffering. This policy, I believe, meets the requirements of the public opinion of the whole country and will certainly be supported by the colleagues of your council. This is what I want to explain first.</p>
<p>Because peaceful unification has not been realized, the country cannot get a peaceful construction environment, and recovery and relief are severely hindered everywhere. Our compatriots are suffering from the threat and pain of the destruction of peace and order, economic life cannot be stabilized, and social order and national morality have been seriously affected. This is really the main reason why our country cannot enter the right track after the war. It is the government's responsibility to overcome all difficulties and take responsibility, cure the symptoms and the root causes, and do everything possible. The colleagues of your council, concerned about national affairs, must have good plans and suggestions to contribute to the government. The relevant authorities have other reports on the administrative facilities of various departments. What I hope for from you, council members, mainly includes the following points:</p>
<p>First, since the promulgation of the Constitution, the rules and regulations for implementing the Constitution have been formulated one after another. This implementation of constitutional government is the key to the success or failure of democratic politics in our Republic of China. Now, there are only seven months left before the implementation of the Constitution. With our vast area in China and such a weak foundation of autonomy and education, the preparatory work for carrying out various elections and establishing the scale of constitutional government is complicated. I hope that all council members will do their best to assist at any time, whether in the central government or in local areas.</p>
<p>Second, the current economic, financial, monetary and price issues affect the general life of the people and are related to the progress of national construction. The government is anxiously seeking a proper solution to this problem. The emergency economic measures promulgated in February of this year must of course be implemented thoroughly, but in terms of the technology of implementation, as well as the urgency of the steps, and how to adapt to the special circumstances of various places, and how to prevent malpractices, you, gentlemen, have always been concerned about this issue, and I hope you will contribute your opinions as much as possible so that more satisfactory and effective results can be achieved. In addition, if there are any areas that should be supplemented, I hope you will provide opinions, and the government will carefully consider them and implement them.</p>
<p>Third, the improvement of administrative efficiency has a significant impact on the promotion of public affairs and the welfare of the people. The **integrity** mentioned in the last meeting of your council is actually another aspect of administrative efficiency. The government is determined to **eliminate** corruption, but the fundamental plan is to understand the advantages and disadvantages of local politics and the actual implementation situation. We want to create a **clean** government and also create a rapid, reliable, capable, and efficient government. You know the suffering of the people and hope to convey the feelings of the people, point out the gains and losses, so that the central government and local areas can communicate and the country and the people can benefit.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to raise a fundamental issue to you, gentlemen, which is the issue of national morality and general atmosphere. Recalling the time of the War of Resistance, we Chinese people, with a weak foundation, carried out a difficult war and finally overcame many difficulties and won a glorious victory. I believe that it was the result of the country's unanimous adherence to two common principles. These two principles are "nation above all" and "will concentrated, strength concentrated". Since the end of the War of Resistance, the general public, after eight years of intense hardship, relaxed the psychology of caution and fear, and lost the spirit of selflessness, resulting in a gradual decline in the concept of the country and the concept of national responsibility. This must be said to be the biggest obstacle to revival and construction. Now the national affairs are still extremely difficult, and construction is about to begin. It all depends on the concentration of will and strength of our compatriots across the country, enduring labor and hardship, and working together to overcome difficulties to create a new atmosphere for national construction. You, gentlemen, are the forerunners of society and the teachers of the people. I deeply hope that this meeting will have a practical and energetic discussion on changing the social atmosphere, promoting the spirit of caring for the country, improving the concept of responsibility, and establishing the foundation of the rule of law, so as to call on the whole people to move towards the great goal of realizing democracy and achieving national construction. I personally hope that you will not hesitate to make criticisms and correct me so that I can be worthy of the heavy responsibility. I wish you all good health and the success of the conference!</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Suburbs of Changchun: Gongzhuling and Fanjiatun Captured One After Another; Du Yuming Holds an Emergency Meeting in Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shengan, by Telegraph] The battle for the suburbs of Changchun has already begun. The majority of the Communist forces have moved to the outskirts of Changchun. Yesterday afternoon, the Communist forces attacked the suburbs from the south, north, and west. In the south, they pressed forward from Mengjiatun Railway Station; in the north, they attacked Kuanchengzi District. The defending troops fiercely repelled them, and they were all unsuccessful. In the west, the Communist infantry and cavalry jointly launched a fierce attack on Dafangshen Airfield. After an hour of intense fighting, the defending troops safely withdrew at 9:00 PM, and the airfield personnel also safely evacuated. The Communist forces once attacked from the northwest towards Sunjia Zi and charged from the southwest corner to the Courthouse Square, but were repelled. The defending troops are strong and their morale is high. Changchun is as solid as a rock.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Changchun, 20th] Gongzhuling and Fanjiatun Railway Stations on the China Chang Railway have both been captured by the Communist forces. The Communist forces are now moving towards Changchun in two directions and have approached nearby. The National Army seems to be preserving its mobile force in Fushun and Mouden, waiting for an opportunity to inflict a major blow on the Communist forces.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shenyang, 20th] After the fall of Gongzhuling, most of the National Army retreated to Guojiadian to defend Siping. The Communist forces are advancing from Gongzhuling towards Changchun. The person in charge of affairs in Gongzhuling said that Changchun has plenty of troops and food and can be defended resolutely.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shenyang, 19th] Gongzhuling fell at 1:51 PM on the 19th. The situation in Fanjiatun at 3:30 PM is unclear. The majority of the Communist main forces are passing through Huaide along the China Chang Railway, pressing towards Changchun. Furthermore, Liufangzi Railway Station, north of Gongzhuling, caught fire at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shenyang, 20th] According to aerial reconnaissance, large units of the Communist forces are gathering outside Changchun and on the north bank of the Dongliao River.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Changchun, 20th] Changchun is busy preparing for war. Military vehicles shuttle through the streets, and prices have soared several times. There is also a lack of markets.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shenyang, 20th] Du Yuming is suffering from a leg ailment and was unable to go to the front lines in person. He held an emergency meeting at his official residence on the morning of the 20th. Dozens of senior generals, including Zheng Dongguo and Zhao Jiajun, participated.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shenyang, 20th] The situation in the Northeast is serious. The success or failure of both sides hinges on this one action.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Shenyang, 20th] A certain military official stated: This Communist offensive is a full-scale launch, with a force of approximately 50 regiments, about 8 regiments and 1 division west of Changchun, about 3 divisions in the Jilin area, about 6 brigades in Meihekou, and the rest being mostly local organizations.</p>

<h3>Student Actions Go Overboard: Ping Municipality Organizations Issue a Circular Appeal, Hoping that the Government Will Rectify the Academic Atmosphere in the Future</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, Daily] Eleven organizations in Ping Municipality, including industry, agriculture, commerce, culture, education, and women's groups, recently issued a circular to the whole country regarding the student movement issue. The original text is recorded as follows: "The Chinese Communists initiate chaos, blocking the door to peace talks. The government's use of force is truly a last resort. Compatriots across the country all understand this, so they are able to contribute money and effort, with one heart and one mind, to assist the government in carrying out the war against the rebellion. After the victory of the War of Resistance, internal strife continued to erupt. For a decade, war has not ceased. The country's finances are strained, and the people are utterly exhausted. This is all expected. In order to strive for lasting happiness, we temporarily endure hardship and support the government, so we are able to bear it with pleasure. Now, the suppression of the rebellion is winning victories one after another, and the Communist forces are being driven to the end of their road, with their destruction foreseeable. In order to stubbornly reverse the declining trend, they are employing their habitual tricks, obstructing the reception of Lushun and Dalian, sabotaging international loans, inciting student strikes in various places, taking the opportunity to coerce, agitating people's hearts, and disrupting society. Qinghua and other schools in Ping Municipality are even openly taking to the streets under the guise of opposing internal war and opposing starvation, shouting and scolding, gathering crowds to fight, and destroying laws and discipline. Nothing is more extreme than this. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, people from all walks of life have been calling for military affairs to come first, but they have never neglected education. Even if it means robbing Peter to pay Paul, they must strive to maintain it. Among the universities, there is even a public funding system to aid students whose families are in enemy-occupied areas. Even during times of tense situations, the authorities are still able to continue education without interruption. The wise measures of the authorities have long been praised by the people. Unexpectedly, some students at present do not understand right from wrong, do not distinguish between benefits and harms, are incited by villains, and engage in excessive actions. Good young people are being used as political tools, and dignified academic institutions are actually becoming places for creating chaos. At a time when people's lives are extremely difficult, they are actually able to study for free. It can be said that the government has done its utmost in benevolence and righteousness towards them. Who would have thought that they would still be dissatisfied, shouting to oppose starvation and demanding an increase in public funding? This is directly creating difficulties for the government and indirectly plundering the people's food and clothing. If young students do not consider themselves to be a special class, how can they be so arbitrary? Moreover, the responsibility for the internal war is very clear and cannot be disguised. If the Chinese Communists can return the army to the country and abandon their underground network, peace can be achieved immediately. However, a small number of students are not seeking this and are actually shouting against the internal war within the government's area. What are their intentions? It is self-evident. For ten years, the suffering endured by people from all walks of life has been a hundred times greater than that of the students, and the preferential treatment they receive is less than one-tenth of that of the students. Compatriots directly bear the huge educational expenses. Although they are justified in remaining silent in the face of the current decline in the academic atmosphere, we earnestly hope that the government will strictly rectify it in the future, without the slightest leniency. If schools become places for creating chaos, they should be resolutely disbanded. If students are willing to act as accomplices of tigers, they should be severely punished. Only then can the stubborn and unruly trend be stopped, and the great plan for a century can be maintained. Furthermore, we hope that compatriots across the country will supervise and urge the government to stabilize social order and encourage the soldiers at the front to achieve complete success in suppressing the rebellion, so that peace can arrive soon. Our organization is willing to work together with compatriots across the country to plan and encourage each other. We send this urgent telegram and hope that you will all consider it." Furthermore, the eleven organizations also sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, the content of which was largely the same as the previous telegram.</p>
<h3>Students in Nanjing Parade and Petition: Only 3,000 Students from Sixteen Schools Participate; Clash with Military Police, Several Injured</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Student Self-Government Association of Central University held a meeting on the evening of the 20th, and it is reported that they will continue to strike on the 20th. Furthermore, student representatives from Jinling University and other schools also held a joint meeting, and they may continue to take action in the future.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Nanjing, 20th] The parade and petition in Nanjing by student representatives from sixteen specialized schools in the Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou areas, despite the persuasion of the schools and the authorities, did not achieve complete success and was still realized on the 20th. However, the number of participating schools and people was less than planned. The Oriental Language School, the Pharmacy School, and the Conservatory of Music did not participate. Those who were sent out by the Drama School were blocked. Only some students from Central University and Jinling University participated. Added to the representatives from schools in Suzhou, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, the total number was only 3,000 people. The large group departed at 10:00 AM and did not return until evening, a total of eight hours. The order along the way was relatively good. Only around 11:00 AM, when the group passed the Zhujiang Road intersection, there was a minor dispute with the police, resulting in injuries and arrests. A section of the procession waited near the National Assembly Hall for about six hours. After student representatives contacted Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Hall, they finally marched past the gate of the National Assembly Hall at about 6:00 PM, and then returned to their respective schools via Chengxian Street and other places.</p>
<p>The marching students departed from Central University at 9:00 AM. The large group arrived at Zhujiang Road at about 10:50 AM. More than 300 unarmed military police were already blocking the road, and all the nearby shops were closed. Negotiations lasted for ten minutes. The military police stated that they were carrying out orders and could not let them pass. The students demanded to pass. Amidst the confusion, some students shouted to advance, but were quickly stopped by their classmates. With no result from the negotiations, the large group advanced amidst slogans. At about 11:05 AM, the military police at the scene, except for the military police and the police on the west side of the road who remained in their original positions, used two water cannons to spray the large group at the center of the road. At the same time, the students also resisted with flagpoles and iron buckets filled with paint. During the three blockades, both sides suffered injuries. At this time, about six-tenths of the students had broken through the blockade line. The police maintaining order also clashed with the students in the Zhujiang Road and Xinjiekou areas. Shops along the way closed one after another. The students retreated at about 12:00 PM, and traffic in the area did not return to normal until noon. According to Chen Shanzhou, the director of the Eastern District Police Bureau, a supervisor surnamed Li was injured in the chaos and has been sent to the hospital for treatment. When the large group of students arrived at Guofu Road at about 12:00 PM, the National Assembly Hall was in sight. Military police, mounted patrol teams, police, and the protection corps advised the students not to advance, and the situation was quite tense. The students could not advance, so they sent representatives to the National Assembly Hall to petition. At this time, the classmates who were blocked at the Zhujiang Road intersection and other places also rushed over via detours and waited in the rain in the middle of the road. At about 4:00 PM, the student representatives held an impromptu reception in the middle of the road, sitting on the ground. At 5:00 PM, seven representatives returned accompanied by Wang Tongrong, director of general affairs of the National Assembly Hall, and reported on the negotiation process. The incident was temporarily resolved. The mounted patrol team retreated to the east side of the Beiting Alley intersection at about 5:50 PM. The large group of students advanced in formation at about 6:00 PM, shouting slogans along the way. At 6:00 PM, heavy rain fell again. This was the third rain shower in the afternoon and the heaviest one. More than 2,000 students filed past the National Assembly Hall in the rain, taking a total of one quarter of an hour. When the large group returned to Central University and disbanded, it was already dusk.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] According to investigations, most specialized schools and universities in Nanjing, such as Ginling College, National Central University, Pharmacy School, Language School, Music School, and Drama School, did not participate in the student parade in Nanjing on the 20th. The actual participants were only 1,062 students from Central University, accounting for slightly less than a quarter of the total, and 130 students from Jinling University, accounting for slightly more than one-ninth of the total. Only about 100 students from Yingshi University participated, which was also an absolute minority.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi Receives Student Representatives, Persuades Them Earnestly, Saying That There Is No Precedent in the World for Gathering Crowds to Coerce</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Nanjing, 20th] Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Hall, received seven student representatives from the parade at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 20th. At that time, the marching students had advanced to Linsen Road and were blocked. The student representatives first explained the purpose of the students' petition, which was only to save the education crisis, and submitted written opinions to the National Assembly Hall, requesting that the Assembly pay attention to increasing education funding. Unfortunately, they were blocked at the Zhujiang Road intersection. They now intend to request that the written opinions be forwarded and to find a way to allow the blocked classmates to pass. They repeatedly stated that the purpose of the petition was simple. Shao Lizi said calmly that the issue of the students returning to school could be discussed and decided. If you are willing to return to school, there is no problem, but the military police are only enforcing the law to prevent the marching队伍 from reaching the Assembly Hall, which is actually hindering the affairs of the Assembly while it is in session. As for the measures passed by the State Council to prevent and control the number of petitioners and the methods of handling them, they actually exist in Britain and the United States. If necessary, they can also adopt the decision to disband. Moreover, in demonstrations in Britain and the United States, they only shout slogans during the demonstration to publicly express their hopes. There is no precedent for gathering crowds to coerce. In the past few days, students went to the Executive Yuan to petition and ate all the dinner of the staff. In addition, there were other undesirable phenomena, so the drafting of handling measures began. The government and the students are one. If the government does something unreasonable, you can certainly refuse to obey, but you must never gather crowds to coerce. Then, Shao Lizi explained the point in the written opinions submitted by the students that all students should be changed to publicly funded students, saying: "I was in the Soviet Union 20 years ago, and later I was also an ambassador to the Soviet Union. The Soviet education I saw 20 years ago was only partially publicly funded, and the rest was self-funded. During the war, only the technical vocational school of one railway was publicly funded, and the rest were all self-funded. Currently, all are self-funded. Your proposal for all public funding is not supported by the government's financial resources and is also unfair. You should consider it." However, Shao Lizi immediately stated that the written opinions could be accepted and would be delivered to the presidium and all members of the National Assembly Hall. Then, the students raised several hopes, and Shao Lizi replied: "I am only a person who forwards things, but from my point of view, the government must be responsible for the investigation of medical expenses and responsibilities." Then, there was a slight discussion about studying the route for the students to return to school, and a phone call was made to the garrison headquarters to make a decision. The student representatives left at about 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Some Jinling University Students Take the School Flag Without Permission and Are Stopped</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] About 130 students from Jinling University gathered on the side of the school's auditorium at 8:30 AM this morning to petition the National Assembly Hall. Because most of the students had already resumed their studies, they protested on the spot against the unauthorized taking of the school flag by these hundred or so people and took back the red and yellow flags of Jinling University's honor and handed them over to the school for safekeeping.</p>
<h3>Hailstorm in Wuxi</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Wuxi, 20th] At 7:20 PM this evening, the sky suddenly darkened and dark clouds spread. Then, in the sound of thunder and rain, hail suddenly fell, as large as soybeans. It stopped after only a few minutes.</p>
<h3>The Rumor That Zhang Zhen, Acting Commander of the Capital Garrison, Died of Injuries Is Groundless</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Capital Garrison Command held a press conference at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th. Acting Commander Zhang Zhen made a written statement, reporting on the parade and demonstration of Central University, Jinling University, and other schools today, stating briefly: "When the unarmed military police sent by the Command to Jinling University this morning were preventing the students of the school from going out, armed military police patrolling the area happened to pass by (these patrolling military police were responsible for maintaining order on a regular basis and were not responsible for preventing the students from going out). Seeing the disorderly situation, they fired warning shots into the air, but the students still went out. In order to avoid accidents, the Command immediately withdrew all the patrolling armed military police it usually sent out. Therefore, those who were preventing the student parade from advancing at the Zhujiang Road intersection were entirely unarmed military police and police. At that time, the students rolled up their sleeves and prepared to break through the ranks of the unarmed military police several times. After hesitating for about half an hour, the students linked arms and, with a shout, broke through the unarmed military police frontally, and then the subsequent troops also linked arms and shoulders and swarmed up, and order was therefore disrupted. The police at the scene initially planned to disperse the crowd by releasing water from water cannons, but unexpectedly the water pipes had been seized by organized student pickets, who instead used the water pipes to spray the sides and the ground. At this time, the actions of the student pickets and propaganda teams became increasingly violent. They used iron ink cans and flagpoles for writing slogans, and seized wooden sticks from nearby shops to attack the unarmed military police. The situation at that time was extremely chaotic and fell into a state of mutual fighting and tearing. Dozens of military police were injured. At that time, the ground was slippery due to accumulated water, causing the students who were shoulder to shoulder and the military police at the scene to fall frequently. More than a dozen students were also injured. As of 4:00 PM this afternoon, it has been ascertained that 28 policemen and military police were injured, and more than a dozen students were also injured. However, since the students were holding iron cans, flagpoles, and other objects as weapons, the number of injured military police was actually greater than that of the students. When the student parade advanced to both ends of Linsen Road, unarmed military police once again came out to block them. At this time, in order to avoid another clash between the students and the military police, it was necessary to line up with mounted patrols and rifle teams to stop them. At about 4:00 PM in the afternoon, the marching students sent representatives to the National Assembly Hall to request a meeting with Secretary Shao and made a request to the Command to release the arrested people and provide compensation for the dead and injured. The Command sent its acting chief of staff to meet with them, who told them that death was absolutely not a fact. The four students who were arrested were those who had beaten the military police on the spot and would be handed over to the court for handling in accordance with the law. As for the rumors published in one or two evening newspapers in the city that students had died of injuries, the military police organs sent people to investigate and found that only 11 injured students from the affiliated hospital of Central University had gone for treatment. Among them, 9 had skin abrasions and were discharged after medication. The remaining Sun Aocang had a broken left kneecap, and Fan Jiyan had an injury to his left upper eyelid. They are currently hospitalized for treatment, and the situation is not serious."</p>
<p>[Another Telegraph] A total of thirteen students were arrested. Four have been released on bail, and nine have been transferred to the Capital District Court for handling.</p>
<h3>No Accidents Occurred During the Student Parade in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Correspondent, Beiping, 20th] The authorities here explicitly prohibited this student parade last night. This morning, the students sent a letter to Hu Shi, asking him to forward it to the Beiping Pacification Headquarters for filing, and still proceeded with the planned action. Hu Shi, Mei Yi-qi, and others repeatedly stated to the Pacification Headquarters that they hoped that the student movement would be guided rather than interfered with. The authorities tacitly accepted this, and no accidents occurred today. If the authorities handle the unfortunate incidents that have occurred properly, the strike wave in Beiping may gradually resume classes on the 22nd after three days. Furthermore, some students in the schools that have gone on strike are brewing an anti-strike movement.</p>
<p>[Another Telegraph] Students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Beiyang (Beiping), Chaoyang, Sino-French University, Railway College, Art College, Normal College, Fu Jen University, and the Municipal No. 2 Girls' Middle School, No. 3 Middle School, Baiman Middle School, and Ouwen Middle School paraded today. Tsinghua was the only school to have all of its students participate. A large part of Peking University and Yenching University participated, and the rest had more than half or part of their students participate. The number of middle school students was relatively small. The procession was about three li long, totaling less than 10,000 people. They gathered at Peking University at noon and set off at one o'clock, with Tsinghua in front and Peking University in the back. Propaganda teams gave speeches and posted slogans along the way, and pickets maintained order. The retired youth army of Tsinghua and Peking University led the way wearing military uniforms and steel helmets. They departed from Shatan and passed through Qianliang Hutong, Dongsi Wangfujing, East and West Chang'an Street, to Xidan Archway. Deng Xiao, a fourth-year student of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Beiyang University, was beaten and injured by several unidentified people at Xidan before the large group arrived. He was sent to Peking University Hospital by the military police. Another Peking University student, Hu Jiezong, was also slightly injured. When the large group passed in front of Zhongnanhai, a petition group went to the Pacification Headquarters to petition. After half an hour, they marched to Xidan. There were disturbances three times because someone threw stones, but fortunately nothing happened. The police and military police maintained order. After passing Xidan, they returned to Peking University without incident via the Fourth Archway.</p>
<p>When the students paraded today, in addition to distributing various propaganda materials, they also issued declarations and letters to soldiers, letters to elders, and letters to middle school students.</p>
<h3>Two Factions of Students in Tianjin Resort to Violence and Mutual Assault</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 20th] After the school authorities' dissuasion was ineffective, some students from Nankai University and Beiyang University still separately went out to parade on the 20th. About 300 students from Beiyang University went out, and more than 100 students from Hebei Institute of Technology joined them along the way. At the Jingang Nandukou, where they entered the downtown area, the unarmed police were ordered to dissuade them from stopping. However, the student group did not accept it, and passed through the traffic intersection guarded by the police and advanced to the city center, posting slogans along the way and shouting slogans such as "Immediately stop conscripting and collecting grain, oppose internal war." When they walked to the entrance of the Roxy Theater on Roosevelt Road, they met some students from the Tianjin Student Patriotic Association, an organization opposed to the strike. The students from the Student Patriotic Association also shouted slogans, saying that strikes cannot save the country and that parades disrupt social order. Because of disagreements, the two sides resorted to violence, and order was disrupted for a while. The police took the students who caused the incident to the police station. Afterwards, more than 100 students from Beiyang University went to the municipal government to petition, insisting that the mayor meet with them. The mayor met with six representatives selected by the students. They demanded that the municipal government punish the person in charge of the police station and release the arrested students. The mayor told them that he would investigate separately, and that the students arrested by the police station to prevent accidents would be returned to their respective schools after investigation. As for Nankai University, more than 400 students from the school had a conflict with the students of the Student Patriotic Association not far from the school.

<h3>The Philippine Senate Passes Three Bills to Boycott Overseas Chinese, All Recommended by Satoru, Chairman of the Anti-Chinese Alliance</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 20th] The Philippine Senate passed three bills to boycott overseas Chinese on their third reading last night and have now been sent to the House of Representatives for a vote. All three bills were recommended by Satoru, Chairman of the Anti-Chinese Alliance: (1) Stipulating that foreigners who violate immigration laws be fined up to 500 US dollars and sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years, and then deported. (2) Stipulating that the timber produced by the Philippine Republic can only be sold by Filipino merchants or retailers. (3) Stipulating that the retail of medical products and pharmaceuticals is entirely operated by Filipinos.</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 20th] Presidential Secretary Abelo announced today after discussing with officials from the Immigration Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: "The matter of Chinese immigration to the Philippines, which was suspended since last November pending the ratification of the Treaty of Friendship between the two countries, will now be resumed. One hundred Chinese will be allowed to enter the country each month, half of whom will be selected from those who reside or own property in the Philippine Islands, and the other half will be determined by lottery. Immigration laws stipulate a limit of 500 Chinese immigrants per year. Immigration was suspended in November and December."</p>
<h3>All Japanese Liquid Assets Are Prioritized for Occupation Costs: The Far Eastern Commission Announced Its Decision Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The Far Eastern Commission today announced a policy decision regarding the distribution of Japanese reparations, effectively recognizing the priority of the United States. It is reported that Japanese liquid assets will be used as collateral to repay occupation costs and aid. The decision stipulates that any allocation cannot disregard the repayment of occupation costs. According to well-informed sources, this clause was formulated under the direction of the United States, indicating that the United States, due to its actual bearing of all occupation costs, the supply of food to the Japanese, and the costs of other new materials, should have priority in claiming Japanese gold and other liquid assets.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Commission's directive also stipulates that the removal of reparations shall not hinder the minimum standard of living of the Japanese people, based on 1934, as previously stipulated by the Commission. The Far Eastern Commission also generally ruled that reparations should be allocated on a broad political basis, giving due consideration to the extent of material and personal life destruction and loss suffered by each claimant state, thereby resulting in compensation and punishment for the results of Japanese aggression. At the same time, due consideration should also be given to the contribution of each country to defeating Japan, including the size and duration of its resistance to Japanese aggression. The Far Eastern Commission specifically excluded overseas funds from the scope of this policy decision. This decision is consistent with the Far Eastern Commission's general view that the Commission will not intervene in these funds and will focus its main work on the issue of the allocation of funds within Japan. At the same time, the Far Eastern Commission announced that the Commission has also made two decisions to relax the restrictions on Japan's foreign trade, one regarding the source of Japan's imports and the other regarding the destination of Japan's exports. The Commission stipulates that the main purpose of Japan's export plan is to make Japan's exports to areas that can obtain the maximum cash, as a commercial export, as opposed to the movement of goods for reparations. In other words, Japanese goods can only be supplied to recipients who are willing to pay for them with imports that Japan lacks or with cash that can be immediately used to purchase these exports. As for Japan's exports, the Far Eastern Commission decided that they should be obtained in the most convenient and cheapest way, but it also stipulates that only the interests of the United Nations can be considered when trading goods that are of significant interest to any of them.</p>

<h3>Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Xu Shiying, Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong; Says Mongolian and Tibetan Policy Should First Focus on Stabilizing the Border Regions</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Xu Shiying, the newly appointed Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday. Fang Zhi, Yang Xiaotian, Wang Zhengting, and others personally went to the pier to welcome him. Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, Wu Zhongxin, Luo Liangjian, Wu Guozhen and others from the Executive Yuan also sent representatives to welcome him. Xu is scheduled to take the night train to the capital on the 21st to assume his new post.</p>
<p>When interviewed by reporters about his policy towards Mongolia and Tibet, he said: The government should have a set policy towards Mongolia and Tibet, and I cannot make any statements until I have met with Chairman Chiang and President Zhang. In principle, however, the current Mongolian and Tibetan policy should focus on connecting with their emotions, helping their economy, improving their lives, and increasing their happiness. The most important thing is to stabilize the border regions first, and then formulate a plan and proceed step by step. As Mr. Xu has been stationed in Japan for many years, he was asked about his observations on the situation in Japan. Mr. Xu said: China should pay attention to Japan. The general population of Japan does not want to build up their military and invade other countries, but rather wants to develop their economy and increase their wealth. Today's control policies of the Allied forces are in line with their wishes. Japan's light industry can recover within the next year. China will not be threatened by Japan militarily in the future, but it will still become a target of economic aggression in the short term, which deserves the vigilance of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu is 75 years old and in good spirits. He spoke with reporters for half an hour without showing any signs of fatigue. This is also his first time in Shanghai since the War of Resistance. Xu Shiying (right) and Wang Zhengting posing for a photo.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Resuming Classes is "Rescuing Education"!</h3>
<p>The recent surge of student movements in various places has inevitably caused general social unrest. In order to stabilize social order, the government promulgated six temporary measures to maintain social order yesterday. This newspaper has repeatedly commented on the promulgation of these temporary measures, hoping that the general public will share the burden and provide sincere assistance in their respective positions. Unexpectedly, the aforementioned emergency measures have just been promulgated, and a small number of students in various places are still engaging in so-called "hunger marches" and even claiming "eat-all movements," touting "rescuing education," which is bizarre and eccentric. In the end, the real intention is revealed, and it is transformed into a political mass movement of so-called "anti-civil war." Yesterday, students in the capital clashed with the military police during a march, and injuries were inevitable. This is truly unfortunate for the young students, and also unfortunate for society and the country. However, there is some good news amidst the misfortune, namely that in Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, and other areas, some students have already launched a movement to resume classes in the past few days. This is closer to "rescuing education."</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, it is truly incomprehensible that students are striking, petitioning, and marching to rescue education during their precious youth. These actions themselves are not without contradiction to the purpose of "rescuing education." Strikes, petitions, and marches themselves are sufficient to neglect studies. If it is necessary to do this in order to "rescue education," then it is the most ridiculous thing! As for the so-called "eat-all movement," regardless of where the unfolding of this movement will place the youth's personality, in fact, it is not entirely reasonable. Today, there are state-funded students in national universities, subsidized by the state for their food and lodging. But it must be known that at the same time, there are many non-state-funded students, and even more private university students and primary and secondary school students who do not receive state funding. It is even more important to know that those who support the state-funded students in higher education are the majority of people whose own lives are very difficult. If university students do not indulge their emotions and trust their rationality, then there will definitely be a day to rein in at the precipice. As expected, when some students are changing in nature and striking, there are some students who want to resume classes. In some places, the number of signatures participating in the class resumption movement is even greater than those advocating for strikes. The resumption of classes at Fudan University in Shanghai is a clear example. We are glad that students in general, in addition to their enthusiasm, have begun to have a rational recovery, and the proper use of reason is precisely the primary purpose of education. We hope that students in various places can have this trend, so that social order can be stabilized. Therefore, we believe that striking is definitely not rescuing education, but resuming classes is the minimum requirement for rescuing education.</p>
<p>We believe that those who call for strikes in an attempt to achieve their political goals are only a few students. Even some of these students have recently made inciting disturbances their "profession," while the majority of purely good students, fearing the threat of the masses, are forced to submit to their coercion. In their hearts, they originally wanted to attend classes and study, but they suffer from being scattered and alone, as if there is nothing they can do. As a result, accumulating wrongs become right, and "eating all" can actually become a movement, and "striking" can actually be deceptively called "rescuing education." In the world, there is originally only a struggle between right and wrong, a struggle between good and evil. Only those who stand on the side of "right" and the side of "good" should unite together, abide by the law, resume classes, and seek knowledge. Who can stop them? Those who excel at clamoring and causing disturbances, when they ask themselves in the quiet of the night, have they not realized their "wrongdoing" and have they not regretted their "evil"? We hope that the teachers who are responsible for education will bear in mind the heavy responsibility entrusted to them by the country, society, and students' parents. They should guide them according to the situation, patiently and kindly, and support the group of good young people who are "right" and "good," so that they can issue voices of justice and lead bright actions. At the same time, they should influence those students who have strayed into the wrong path of "wrongdoing" and "evil," so that they can correct their mistakes, return to school, and resume their studies. Then there will be hope for the future of education!</p>

<h3>Liberal Party Refuses to Cooperate; New Twists in the Formation of the Japanese Cabinet; Yoshida Cabinet Resigns En Masse Yesterday as Usual</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Prime Minister Yoshida met with the Emperor at the Imperial Palace at 10:00 a.m. on the 20th and submitted his resignation. At the same time, the Cabinet notified the Secretariats of both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. With this, the Yoshida Cabinet has resigned en masse.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Regarding the issue of a four-party coalition cabinet, the Socialist Party has formally refused Yoshida's request. In that case, the Liberal Party will be relegated to the position of an opposition party. The center of gravity in the current political situation has shifted to the work of forming a coalition cabinet by the Democratic, Socialist, and National Cooperative parties.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Although the Japanese political situation has been negotiated under the clash of words for several days, many complications have arisen. Until the day of the convening of the Diet, not only has a solution not been reached, but a major twist has occurred.</p>
<p>In the talks between Katayama and Yoshida this morning, Yoshida suddenly demanded a solution to the issue of the left wing of the Socialist Party. Katayama expressed difficulty with this. After Yoshida reiterated his willingness for Katayama to serve as Prime Minister, he expressed his willingness to assist the Katayama Cabinet as an opposition party. Subsequently, after Katayama reported the process to the Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, the entire body unanimously decided: Katayama would have full authority to handle the political situation. They also believed that if the four-party coalition cabinet failed, they would proceed with the three-party coalition work. If that was unsuccessful, they could even form a two-party coalition cabinet with the National Cooperative Party.</p>
<p>However, at present, other issues such as the positions of Deputy Speakers have not yet been discussed, except for the fact that Katayama's assumption of the premiership is no longer an issue. After this twist occurred today, all cabinet formation work must be started anew. Therefore, although the Diet was still convened as scheduled, the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speakers could not proceed, and the meeting was hastily adjourned after the opening.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Democratic Party President Ashida issued a statement today on the current political situation and the issue of the Speaker, saying: "Regardless of whether the Liberal Party joins the cabinet, the Democratic Party still supports and participates in the coalition cabinet. The Democratic Party has no opinion on the Liberal Party's opposition to the inclusion of the left wing of the Socialist Party in the cabinet. If a four-party coalition cabinet cannot be formed, it may be possible to form a three-party cabinet. If the Liberal Party voluntarily retreats to the position of an opposition party, then the position of Speaker seems more suitable for the Democratic Party."</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] In order to compete with the Liberal Party for the position of the second-largest party in the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party is currently working to win over independents and other parties. After obtaining the position of the second-largest party, it can compete for the issue of the Speaker.</p>
<h3>Indian Situation Approaching a Decision Stage; Mountbatten Suggests Partition; British Cabinet Begins Discussing the Viceroy's Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 19th] After arriving here today, Viceroy Mountbatten immediately held meetings with Prime Minister Attlee and other members of the British Cabinet's India Affairs Subcommittee. It is reported that the Viceroy brought a promise from Indian Muslims to agree to a plan for the process of handing over power to India. Responsible persons said that according to Mountbatten's plan, Britain should transfer power in India to "at least two constituent assemblies," one belonging to Muslims and the other to Hindus. The main points of the plan are nothing more than: (1) Dissolving the existing Constituent Assembly in New Delhi. Currently, this assembly is largely controlled by the Indian National Congress and is rejected by the Muslim League. (2) Replacing it with separate assemblies for Hindus and Muslims to draft constitutions for the partition of India. (3) Partition should be implemented internally in the two major provinces of Bengal and Punjab. (4) A referendum will be held in the Northwest Frontier Province to decide whether to be autonomous or to be incorporated into the Hindu or Muslim areas. (5) The powers of the existing coalition temporary government may be transferred to a comprehensive new temporary government, with representatives designated by each constituent assembly to participate.</p>
<p>Other issues discussed included public health, epidemic prevention, transportation, food shortages, irrigation, and forestry. Defense Minister Alexander and British Army Commander-in-Chief in India, Marshal Auchinleck, also participated in the meeting. Some people believe that the participation of the two is of great significance, indicating the possible crisis of the partition of India. The main reason for the Viceroy's sudden return to the country is that Muslims are demanding that the current mixed Hindu-Muslim composition of the Indian army be changed to separate Hindu and Muslim units.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] According to executives, British Cabinet's opinion is gradually leaning towards the partition of India. The partition plan will create two separate states in India, one being Hindu Hindustan and the other being Muslim Pakistan. Pakistan will be composed of two non-contiguous pieces of land (Punjab and Bengal), located at the two ends of the "V" shape of India, so it will likely encounter many difficulties. It is expected that military figures will oppose the partition plan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] The "Daily Mail" reported today that Patton has submitted a suggestion to Attlee, advocating for convening a meeting of Indian leaders in London to replace the meeting scheduled to be held in Simla on June 25th.</p>
<h3>Harriman Advocates Restoring Industry and Commerce in Germany and Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Los Angeles, 19th] Secretary of Commerce Harriman delivered a speech at Los Angeles City Hall today, advocating for the restoration of peacetime economies in Germany and Japan. It is said that the world today is a scene of misery, with difficulties everywhere. Restoring peacetime industry and commerce in Germany, so that it can no longer attack neighboring countries, but can conduct peacetime trade, is extremely important for the revival of the European economy, just as the Japanese economy is necessary for the general revival and economic construction of the Far East. Japan must never again be allowed to attack countries of world peace, but it must not be allowed to become a dead object in terms of economic production and exchange. Japan's poverty, like Germany's poverty, is not only a source of resentment and suffering, but will also hinder all efforts to rebuild other countries in the region.</p>
<h3>Gromyko Elaborates on the Control of Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 20th] Soviet representative to the United Nations Security Council, Gromyko, delivered a speech at the American-Soviet Friendship Society today, saying that the United States' desire to monopolize the production of atomic energy is a misconception. Unless the United Nations takes swift action to ban atomic weapons, the United States will be in an unfavorable position. If one country seeks a patent, it will inevitably cause competition from other countries. If one country uses atomic energy for military purposes, other countries can take the same action. Therefore, mutual suspicion will inevitably hinder relations between countries, and there will be no trust between them. In the current environment, it is undeniable that the United States will sacrifice more than other countries by banning atomic weapons. However, there is no doubt that one country's attempt to monopolize can only be limited to the temporary. Gromyko reiterated three points: (1) The United Nations must immediately ban nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction. (2) After the ban on nuclear weapons, the Soviet Union will agree to international control and supervision measures. (3) The supervision measures must be limited to ensuring the peaceful use of atomic energy and must not hinder the internal economy of the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Prime Minister Receives Soviet Envoy</h3>
<p>Inquiring About Attitude Towards British Dispute</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 19th] Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy received Soviet Ambassador to the city, Shebirin, today and spoke with him for an hour. Afterwards, Prime Minister Nokrashy declared that this meeting had no political significance. Ambassador Shebirin also refused to issue a statement to the press. However, executives in political circles generally believe that this conversation concerns the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Anglo-Egyptian dispute.</p>
<h3>U.S. Delegation Departs for Turkey</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 19th] A delegation jointly formed by the U.S. State Department, Army, and Navy recently departed by plane for Turkey. The mission is to assist Ambassador Wilson in investigating the country's needs in order to determine the content of assistance to be provided within the scope of U.S. aid legislation. The delegation will transfer to Turkey via Frankfurt, Germany, tomorrow. The delegation includes twelve Army representatives, led by Major General Oliver, and seven Navy representatives, led by Rear Admiral Herrmann. The State Department representatives are Cummins from the Foreign Liaison Department and McGill from the Bureau of Financial Development Policy.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 19th] The Turkish Army General Staff has organized a committee responsible for determining the supplies needed by the Turkish Army in order to obtain them from the United States. According to unofficial sources, Turkey will receive several warships from the United States.</p>
<p>Turkish President Inonu Condemns Communism</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 19th] Today is Turkish Youth Day. President Inonu gave a speech, openly condemning communism and racism. He said, "During the war, the Turanian nationalist movement, incited by the enemy, attempted to move in all directions, but Turkish youth were not fools and would not be fooled. Later, that faction used the slogans of progress, democracy, and anti-fascism, and almost formed a dangerous movement, but it was also unsuccessful. All of these ideologies are wrong. All political developments in Turkey must be carried out within the legal scope. Although democratic politics sometimes encounters difficulties, it will gradually progress. In short, I believe that democratic politics will be able to achieve stability."</p>
<h3>Soviet Delegation Arrives in Seoul; Negotiations Expected to Begin Today</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 20th] The Soviet delegation of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission for negotiations on the Korean issue arrived here today, and negotiations are expected to begin on the 21st.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Seoul, 20th] Korean Civil Administrator Hong An-gil (transliteration) issued an order today prohibiting mass rallies and demonstrations such as parades during the meeting of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission. It is also learned that Dr. Kim Gu has resigned from his position in the Joint Committee of the Provisional Legislative Assembly for unknown reasons, but it is learned that Kim Gu is in an American hospital for treatment due to poor health.</p>
<h3>Total Eclipse - Scientists Gather in Mashi to Observe</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Rio de Janeiro, 19th] A total solar eclipse will be visible tomorrow in Araxá and Poxoréu, Brazil. It is estimated that in Araxá, the eclipse will begin at 11:19 AM standard time. The total eclipse will begin at 12:28 PM, and the eclipse will completely disappear by 1:52 PM. Twenty-four hours before the start of the eclipse, the skies over Araxá and Poxoréu are clear. Gambling Brazilians have placed bets at odds of four to one that the sky will remain clear during the four minutes of the total solar eclipse tomorrow. Scientists from thirteen countries have now gathered in these two locations, with total observation costs estimated at 200,000 yuan. If clouds are discovered in the sky at that time, only American scientists with aircraft equipment will be able to observe from above the clouds to a limited extent. The rest of the scientists will have to sigh and look at the sky. At the same time, the indigenous people of central Brazil are deeply disturbed by the approaching solar eclipse. At that time, there will inevitably be superstitious actions such as group prayers, chanting, and shooting arrows into the sky.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 19th] There will be a total solar eclipse on the 20th. According to the Taiwan Provincial Meteorological Bureau, the time of the first contact will be 11:10:48 AM on the 20th. The maximum eclipse will be at 1:35:06 PM, and the end of the eclipse will be at 4:23:54 PM (Greenwich time). The path of the total eclipse will make landfall on the west coast of the Indian Ocean, pass through central Africa to the Atlantic Ocean, then enter South America and exit into the Pacific Ocean. However, all parts of China (including Taiwan) will not be able to see even a partial eclipse.</p>
<h3>Britain and America Accuse Bulgaria, Albania, Yugoslavia and Other Countries of Supporting Greek Guerrillas; Conflicts Continue to Arise in the Balkan Peninsula</h3>
<p>[United Press, Geneva, 20th] According to well-informed sources: the forthcoming joint report by the United Nations Balkan Investigative Committee will accuse Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania of supporting Greek guerrillas. It is said that the report also contains evidence to determine that Yugoslavia and Bulgaria are attempting to incite discontent among the Greeks in Macedonia. Conversely, the Soviet report will certainly deny the interference of Greece's three neighboring countries, and accuse some of the witnesses as "criminals."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 20th] Conflicts continue to arise in the Balkan Peninsula. The United Nations has dispatched a temporary border commission to monitor the situation. Greece is now preparing to guarantee full cooperation with the commission today. Its neighbors, Albania and Bulgaria, intend to oppose the duties of the commission's investigators. The Security Council will meet today. All three countries will be able to express their opinions. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the resolution proposed by the Soviet Union, which advocates that the investigators of the commission should be limited to handling the tasks specifically assigned by the Security Council. Their offices should be moved away from Thessaloniki, near the Greek border, and the lives of the investigators should be strictly restricted. The United States and Britain will oppose this Soviet proposal. The temporary border commission is ordered to go to the Greek border area to monitor the situation, pending the completion of the report on the Greek border incidents being drafted by the formal committee in Geneva, and to submit it to the Security Council for a decision on action.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Celebrations for Ho Chi Minh's Birthday; Viet Minh Forces Launch General Offensive; Saigon Declares State of Emergency</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 19th] Viet Minh troops launched a full-scale offensive in the areas around Saigon last night, and Saigon authorities have declared a state of emergency as a result. According to some sources, yesterday was the birthday of Ho Chi Minh, President of the Viet Minh Republic. Therefore, the Viet Minh troops came out to act, launching a general offensive against all guard posts east and southwest of Saigon, which lasted for several hours, but finally retreated.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Saigon, 19th] Today is the 57th birthday of Ho Chi Minh, President of the Viet Minh Republic. Several French military outposts outside Saigon were attacked by the Viet Minh underground army last night, seemingly as a decoration for Ho Chi Minh's birthday. The Vietnamese side claims that the French suffered far greater losses than the Vietnamese in this attack, while French military officials say they have not yet received a detailed report. The Vietnamese newspapers here today published photos of "freedom fighters," with portraits of Ho Chi Minh alongside those of Nehru of India, President Sukarno of Indonesia, and President Roxas of the Philippines. According to a leader of the Viet Minh underground movement, thousands of Viet Minh men and women held underground gatherings here today, reiterating their determination to be loyal to Ho Chi Minh until death. Wherever the French army cannot reach, the Vietnamese people are openly celebrating enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Preconditions for Peace Talks</p>
<p>[Reuters Saigon 20th] A Viet Minh underground newspaper published in a suburb of Saigon stated that Viet Minh President Ho Chi Minh said that negotiations between the Viet Minh and the French government could only begin if the French side recognized the Viet Minh as an independent state within the French Union. If negotiations cannot begin or unfortunately fail, the Viet Minh people can continue to fight for freedom for five or ten years if necessary.</p>

<h3>The Four-Power Committee Discussed Procedural Matters but Failed to Reach an Agreement</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Vienna, 19th] The Four-Power Committee met today to discuss several procedural issues. The opinions of the countries are still very divided, and each insists on its own view, refusing to concede slightly, so that today's meeting still failed to reach an agreement. The main issue discussed today was whether to authorize the Expert Committee to begin discussing certain issues related to German assets, or to immediately begin studying the Zistersdorf oil issue, as the Soviet representative intended. The four representatives had different views and failed to reach a consensus.</p>
<h3>The Extermination of Sparrows Affects the Harvest</h3>

<h3>Conserve Cigarette Consumption</h3>
<p>The US Secretary of the Treasury Calls on the People to</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 20th] Since the passage of the new budget, British cabinet ministers have no longer smoked in cabinet meetings. Treasury Secretary Dalton, when appealing to the people to reduce cigarette consumption by 25% to save US loan funds, announced this frugal matter.</p>
<h3>The Struggle for Middle East Oil is Now in Full Swing; Pravda Publishes an Article Attacking American Ambitions</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] Soviet leader economist Varga wrote in today's Pravda that the struggle for oil rights in the Middle East is now in full swing. In order to increase the transport volume of the Kirkuk-Haifa oil pipeline, Britain plans to build another oil pipeline from Iran to the Mediterranean coast, which is expected to be completed in 1949. The recent American activities in Palestine and Egypt prove that America intends to obtain outlets for Saudi Arabian oil in these two places for strategic purposes. America is apparently taking advantage of Britain's economic difficulties to force Britain to make solutions favorable to America on various issues related to Middle East oil policy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 19th] Soviet economist Varga wrote in Pravda that the United States is seeking to become a hegemony in the Mediterranean, resorting to all kinds of monopolies, attempting to divide up most of the oil sources of other countries. The United States has 6% of the world's population and 35% of the world's developed oil sources, and should be content with that, and should not covet the oil sources of other countries. Now in the Near East and Middle East, the United States needs to obtain strongholds on all the coasts reached by oil pipelines. After Palestine and Egypt are separated from British influence, they will become such strongholds, and the oil pipeline connecting Saudi Arabia can be connected to these places. This is one of the reasons for the large-scale activities of the United States in these regions.</p>
<h3>United Nations News Committee - Dutch Representative Elected Chairman</h3>
<p>Our country will be represented by Zhang Pingqun at the meeting</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] The Commission on Freedom of the Press, composed of twelve member states of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, held its opening ceremony today.

They were selected by the Social Council to serve as experts rather than as representatives of governments. Laugier emphasized that although the principle of freedom of the press has been recognized by all member states of the United Nations, the tasks facing the Commission are still difficult. He said: "The application of this principle varies greatly from country to country, often changing its fundamental concepts due to tradition and current customs." The first task of the Commission is to draft the agenda and files for the International Conference on Freedom of the Press to be convened at the next regular session of the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>Accounting Committee - First Meeting</p>
<p>Another subordinate body of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, the Accounting Committee composed of fifteen countries, also held its first meeting today and elected its officers.

The British government is now in contact with the Soviet government to determine the date for the formal exchange of ratification. The Finnish Treaty only requires the ratification of Britain and the Soviet Union, so the treaty will take effect from the date of the exchange of ratification. The Soviet government informed the British government three months ago, stating that the Soviet Union was prepared to ratify the Finnish Treaty in mid-month, but so far it is not known what action the Soviet Union has taken on this matter.</p>

<p>Speaker Pan Inspects Students at the National School in Dachang District Who Welcome Him by Waving Flags (Photo by Our Newspaper)</p>
<h3>Speaker Visits Dachang and Zhenru; No Compensation Given for Requisitioned Land; Lack of Water and Electricity Supply Felt</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Municipal Senate Speaker Pan and Secretary-General Xiang visited the Dachang and Zhenru districts yesterday morning, accompanied by the district chiefs and chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies. As a result of the speaker's inspection, he learned a lot about the areas that each district hopes to build or improve. The main points are as follows: (1) During the period of the occupation, the enemy forcibly occupied more than 5,000 mu of civilian land in the Dachang district to build an airport, without paying any compensation. Now that it has been taken over by the Central Government, the government should quickly pay for the land. (2) Before the War of Resistance, the Dachang district was under the jurisdiction of Baoshan County. After the victory, the Shanghai Municipal Government, referring to the original plan of the Republic of China, has been promoting district administration in the Dachang district since 1927. Since then, various facilities have been very effective, and the relationship between officials and civilians has been harmonious. However, the boundaries between the county and the city have not yet been clearly defined by the highest authorities, resulting in disputes over governance from time to time. It is requested that the government follow the actual situation and follow the wishes of the people, and quickly and clearly assign it to the municipal government in order to prevent disputes.</p>
<p>Narrow Roads in Disrepair for Many Years</p>
<p>(3) The streets in Pengpu and Dachang towns are extremely narrow. After the war, many houses were destroyed, and citizens often rebuild them. However, the area of the streets is limited, and the newly built houses are uneven and without standards. It is requested that the Public Works Bureau quickly measure them so that they can be uniform. In addition, the streets have been in disrepair for many years, and the sewers are also blocked, preventing the flow of sewage. It is also requested that the Public Works Bureau repair them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Requisitioned Civilian Land Should be Returned Quickly</p>
<p>(4) In the Zhenru district, near the Zhenru Transmitting Station of Shanghai International Radio Station, there are more than 30 mu of civilian land that were occupied by the enemy during the war. After the victory, the station took it over. Not only did it not return the land to the owners, but it has recently expanded the scope, erecting a large number of iron towers and wooden poles, and the occupied civilian land is more than 100 mu, which has a great impact on agricultural production. It is requested that the government quickly stop this and return it to the original owners to benefit farmers and protect property rights.</p>
<p>Lack of Sanitary Facilities Also Felt</p>
<p>(5) There is a severe shortage of water and electricity supply in the Dachang and Zhenru districts. The residents of the district generally believe that since the existing water and electricity companies in the districts cannot fully supply water and electricity, they are requested to give up their exclusive rights, and let the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company take over the matter.</p>
<p>(6) There is a lack of sanitary facilities in the Dachang and Zhenru districts. According to the Health Bureau, if the districts have suitable houses, they can consider setting up clinics. Now the Zhenru district plans to raise tens of millions of yuan to accomplish this.</p>
<p>This morning, the speaker will continue to inspect the Yangsi and Yangjing districts.</p>

<h3>Finance Bureau Personnel on Duty Have Three Types of Credentials</h3>
<p>Incomplete Credentials Mean a Forgery</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Municipal Finance Bureau said that recently, there have often been cases in this city where people falsely used the opportunity to deliver tax payment notices to check accounts and extort money from shops. A public notice was issued yesterday stating that the bureau's field staff must wear badges when on duty, carry a field pass (with a photo, stating the name, position, and stamped with the bureau's seal), and a duty list (stating the date, location, and task of the duty).

<h3>One of the Main Culprits of the Nanjing Massacre, Tanaka Will Be Sent to Nanjing for Trial; A Gruesome Photo of Him Personally Beheading Victims Is Obtained; Izawa's Hospital Stay Extended, Postponing His Transfer</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Tanaka Gunji, a major war criminal who was escorted to Shanghai from Japan the day before yesterday, holds the military rank of Major. He is temporarily detained in the detention center of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. He will be sent to the Nanjing Military Tribunal for trial soon, as Tanaka Gunji is one of the main culprits in the Nanjing Massacre. He is from Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan, and is currently 43 years old. He graduated from the 37th class of the Japanese Military Academy, specializing in artillery. He and Hashimoto Kingoro are both well-known radical right-wing elements. Before the War of Resistance, he served as a captain in the Kanda Division, stationed in Beiping, Baoding, Zhengding, and other places in our country. In 1937, when Nanjing fell, the Japanese army wantonly burned and killed civilians after entering the city. Tanaka was a company commander under Tani Hisao at the time and was the first to break into the city of Nanjing. He personally used a military sword to kill more than 200 of our soldiers and civilians. Among the documents investigated by the resident delegation in Japan, there is a gruesome photo of Tanaka personally beheading our captured soldiers in Nanjing with his sword. In addition, there are documents from the Japanese side praising Tanaka's courage in killing. As for Major General Izawa Sadaki, the reason why he was not escorted in the same plane this time is that the criminal is currently bedridden in the hospital, so he has been temporarily granted an extension for his transfer.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The crime of the Taiwanese criminal Huang Zairong is reportedly for smuggling synthetic sugar. The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters has telegraphed the Taiwan Garrison Headquarters to send personnel to extradite him.</p>
<h3>The Rumor of Doihara's Extradition Is Not True</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the person in charge of the resident delegation in Japan in Shanghai, the rumor that Doihara will soon be extradited to China is absolutely not true. Izawa was not extradited due to illness and will be escorted back on a convenient flight after he recovers. Our country has requested the extradition of many Japanese war criminals, and many documents have been sent recently because the UK, the US, and France attach great importance to the evidence of crimes. As for the handling of the returned items, it is proceeding actively, and four or five ships can be recovered next month.</p>
<h3>Revealing Information From a Factory Manager's Smoking Worker; Port Affairs Group Personnel's Extortion of 50 Million Exposed; Wang Zhaoren and Chen Bohua Detained and Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Zhaoren (45 years old, Ningbo native), an honorary supervisor of the port affairs patrol team of the port police station, and Chen Bohua (28 years old, residing at No. 1 Longmen Road) recently colluded with Zheng Zhongwen and Lian Qingxiang, who impersonated military personnel and another accomplice who is still at large. They went to the home of Chen Xiuzhang, the manager of the Xinhua Hat Factory at No. 61 Gaofu Lane, Changle Road, on the pretext of searching for opium. They extorted 50 million yuan by finding a can of ashes. The next day, they divided the money in the dormitory of the wharf outside the No. 1 pier of the group. Afterwards, someone secretly reported to the police station. Director Xuan ordered detectives Ma Feimu and Ding Wenyang to investigate and verify the facts. At 0:45 on the 17th of this month, Chen Bohua was arrested at the entrance of the Carlton Theater. A Mauser pistol and four bullets were found on him. After interrogation at the station, he confessed the details. He said that this time it was initiated by Wang Zhaoren and Li Zhongwen. At that time, they received a report from Zhang Acai, a worker at the Xinhua Hat Factory, saying that the factory manager Chen Xiuzhang smoked opium and could be extorted for money. After discussion, they hired a car on the 10th of this month to Chen's residence. Chen was out at the time, so Wang Zhaoren searched out the ashes on the spot. Then his concubine intervened and arranged a negotiation with his wife at No. 17 Liuyuan Road, Weile Road. As a result, Chen was willing to pay 50 million yuan in cash as a reward, packed in three hat cages, and hired a car to send them to the intersection of Zhongzheng Road and Beile Road. Then the suspect hired a Haida Taxi to the Tongqing Money Exchange on Sijing Road to deposit it into the suspect's current account first, and then distribute it the next day. In addition to Wang, Li, Lian, and the suspect, there were six informants. Each person received an average of 3 million yuan, and the remaining 20 million yuan was swallowed by Li alone. After the police station received the confession, they sent a letter to the port affairs group and detained Wang on the morning of the 19th, and sent him to the detective team for investigation. The confession was the same as Chen's. However, the accomplices Zhongwen and Lian Qingxiang had fled after hearing the news. The case was completed yesterday, and it was decided to transfer it to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation today.</p>
<h3>Car Detention Dispute; Jiang Biao Is Accused and the Trial Begins; Both Sides Confront Each Other, Causing Several Conflicts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Jiang Biao, Director of the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan, and Tan Zhaolin, Deputy Director of the Transportation Group of the Bureau, were sued by Liu Qintang, Chairman of the Jianguo Industrial Company, for abuse of power and obstruction of freedom. The District Prosecutor's Office prosecuted them for the crime stipulated in Article 304, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The trial began in the Third Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday morning. After Judge Ye Guiling took the bench, he first summoned the plaintiff, Liu Qintang, for questioning. Liu stated: "On December 24 last year, Jianguo Industrial Company purchased 22 five-ton Dodge trucks from Xinsui Company through a transfer to the Materials Supply Bureau. By December 30, the payment and the trucks had been delivered clearly by both parties. On January 30 of this year, the Materials Supply Bureau issued four vehicle ownership certificates to Jianguo Company. However, on February 18 and 19, the defendants suddenly claimed that Xinsui Company had failed to fulfill the contract and had the 22 trucks that had been delivered to Jianguo Company all taken back by the defendant Tan Zhaolin and his men. The plaintiff then filed a lawsuit in court for seizing materials." Liu also presented vehicle ownership certificates and other documents. Subsequently, the defendant Jiang Biao was summoned, who said, "I have no dealings with Jianguo Company. The contract was signed with Xinsui Company. I didn't know Liu Qintang at all in the past. The detention of the 22 trucks on February 18 and 19 was done by me sending Tan Zhaolin. The reason for the detention was that Xinsui Company violated three items stipulated in the contract: (1) It should not be sold in Shanghai; (2) The February deadline had passed; (3) The full cost of the vehicles had not been paid, and the vehicle ownership still belongs to this bureau. As for the vehicle ownership certificate, it was issued by Chief Wang of the distribution office of this bureau and was not approved by the bureau chief, so it cannot be considered valid." The other defendant, Tan Zhaolin, said, "The detention of the vehicles was carried out on the orders of the bureau chief and no violence was used." Finally, the plaintiff and the defendant confronted each other repeatedly. Both sides presented their arguments and almost clashed. After Judge Ye stopped them, he instructed both parties to submit favorable evidence to the court by the 29th of this month. The oral argument will be held at 9:30 am on the 3rd of next month, and no further summons will be issued.</p>

The tricycle driver, Wang Agen, was crushed in the chest, and Han had his left arm bone broken and both feet injured. The Hongkou Police Station arrived and took the tram driver who caused the accident to the station. Both injured people were sent to Gongji Hospital. Wang Agen eventually died due to his serious injuries.</p>
<h3>Pretending Not to Have Brought Money When Buying Clothes; Apprentice Follows Closely, Scheme Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At the Shita Clothing Store, No. 3238 Changshou Road, at about 6 pm yesterday, a customer claiming to be Wang Zhaoping (No. 24, Jiangbei native) selected a set of padded jacket and trousers and a white short shirt, totaling 95,000 yuan. When paying, he suddenly pretended that he did not bring cash because he was in a hurry when he left. He asked if someone could be sent to his home to get the money. At the same time, he put on the new clothes. The shop owner, Xu Daxiang, suspected nothing and sent the apprentice Tang Suoshan along. Unexpectedly, after leaving the store, Wang took the No. 16 trolleybus. He tried to get off several times on the way, but the apprentice followed closely and failed. When they reached the end of Jiangxi Road, he claimed to have reached his destination. After the two got off the bus, they turned from Wudui Road into the Bund. They followed each other for an hour, and Wang's expression became even more flustered. The apprentice knew that he was not a good person and immediately called the police to arrest him. After interrogation, he confessed that he was extremely bored and attempted to commit fraud. He was later transferred to the Putuo Road Police Station for handling.</p>

Our garrison troops and military police personnel have full responsibility for maintaining public security in this city. The above-mentioned measures for maintaining order should be strictly implemented. This garrison area is originally under martial law.

<h3>Xia Zhongming's Trial Concludes, Awaiting Sentencing; Claims to Know Nothing About the Deaths of Zhu Xingong and Others; Confesses That Wu Shibao, Zhang Guozhen, and Others Did It</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Xia Zhongming, former Deputy Minister of the Puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, who was accused of being a traitor, concluded in the High Court yesterday morning, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the morning of the 27th. Xia is 46 years old, from Suzhou. Before the war, he was the chief clerk of the Shanghai Police Bureau.

<h3>Dance Hall Orchestras Still on Strike</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] It has been five days since the musicians of the dance halls in the city went on strike to demand a salary increase. In recent days, dance halls have been using records to broadcast music, and business has been greatly affected. According to dance hall sources, the strike was orchestrated by Filipino Aranas, the chairman of the Musicians' Union, and the "leaders" separately requested a 100% increase in salary. Although the dance halls have negotiated with them several times, the results have been unsuccessful. The dance halls have agreed to increase by 30%, but the musicians still insist on the original demands. At present, the salaries of the orchestras are 1.8 million yuan per month for Filipinos and between 4 million and 8 million yuan for leaders. Since this incident occurred, the domestic orchestras have also followed suit and gone on strike. Only the coffee music venues in the city are still performing. However, insiders say that they are also watching and waiting. Once the dance hall orchestra is resolved, they may follow up with demands.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation; Legal Explanation</h3>
<p>(1) Extortionate Rent Increase</p>
<p>Chen Dexin asks: A rented several new houses from B last year to open a shop, and agreed to a rent of two shi of rice, but no contract was signed. Unexpectedly, this spring, B actually asked A to increase the rent, otherwise he would demand relocation for renovation. I would like to ask: (1) Is B's request legal? (2) Can A refuse to relocate? (3) If A is forced to, can he sell his business inventory to the landlord at a price? Or claim compensation for loss of the shop?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) It is illegal, because the current laws and regulations, Article 450, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Law stipulates, "If the lease has no fixed term, each party may terminate the lease at any time, but if there is a custom that favors the lessee, follow the custom." (2) Can legally refuse. (3) (A) Cannot force the landlord to buy the business inventory. (B) Except with mutual agreement, compensation can only be claimed if the lessee actually suffers damage due to the landlord's illegal behavior.</p>
<p>(2) Ancestral Inheritance</p>
<p>Huang Qinghua asks: I have six brothers. My third brother was adopted by my paternal uncle. He joined the army during the War of Resistance and died in the army in Hankou in July 1946. Now there are several legal questions, please answer. (1) Can the son of his biological brother be adopted to inherit the estate? (2) The paternal uncle and aunt have passed away early (and have no brothers). Can the adoption procedure be legally established if the parents and uncles of the third brother make the decision and sign the contract?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] The current law no longer has ancestral inheritance. Except for inheritances that began before the implementation of this code (May 5, 1931), which are still subject to the laws at that time, no other ancestral inheritance claims can be made, that is, no adoption issues arise.</p>

<h3>This City's University Students Organize the School Protection Grand Alliance; Fudan and Jinan Universities Resume Classes</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] University students in this city have recently organized the School Protection Grand Alliance and issued a declaration stating: "This student movement occurred strangely and has spread to various schools. For a time, as many as eight schools were on strike. To people in society, it may seem like a unanimous decision and action of all the students, but who knows that this is entirely the scheme of a very small number of conspirators in each school who want to use the name and power of students to create social chaos, increase the government's difficulties, and achieve their goal of overthrowing the government. For the survival of our motherland, for our own future, and more importantly, to be worthy of our conscience and the 450 million compatriots, we have no choice but to organize this School Protection Grand Alliance with a heavy heart. At the same time, we must write down the painful things, one by one:</p>
<p>Appeal to the Government to Rescue the Youth</p>
<p>(1) They launched the "eat it all," "all eat" movement. Is this what our conscience is willing to do? Our public expenses have already increased to more than 70,000 yuan (including rice money and food expenses). We have a "tooth sacrifice" every three days. After the 16th of each month, we have fish and meat at every meal. Do we still want to extract from the heads of the poor people to satisfy our extravagant desires? How can we bear to take away the lifeblood of the common people and increase our enjoyment? (2) They oppose the qualification examination and the final examination. Now the Ministry of Education has allowed the qualification examination and the final examination not to be held. Do we still have an excuse to make trouble? We really can't figure out where the reason for the trouble lies? (3) They oppose "civil war." In fact, how can it be a civil war? It is purely a communist rebellion. Why don't we think about the fact that "the government has issued ceasefire orders several times, but the Communist Party has desperately wanted to fight, and the government has repeatedly begged for peace talks, but the Communist Party has simply ignored them"? We need peace, and we oppose internal strife, but the responsibility for internal strife should not be borne by the government. On the contrary, it should be borne by the Communist Party. (4) They want to rescue education. Does rescuing education mean allowing thousands of young people to enjoy public funding, sitting in school and going on strike every day, neglecting their studies? Does rescuing education mean turning schools upside down and making them restless? Their slogans sound very loud, but their schemes are very poisonous. Therefore, we hope that the Communist Party will show conscience and stop using the beautiful name of rescuing education to destroy education. At the same time, we appeal to the government to rescue the youth.</p>
<p>Continuing Strikes Is Suicide</p>
<p>In short, they have shouted enough nice-sounding terms. Their conscience has been bought with money. For our "future," for the sake of being worthy of our ancestors above, and being worthy of our descendants below, and being worthy of ourselves in the middle, for the sake of preserving a lifeline for our 450 million compatriots, we are here with our conscience, with tears in our eyes, and with a miserable voice, shouting the following slogans in front of our elders, brothers, sisters: (1) Demand that the government come up with a way to stop the Communist Party from operating in schools! (2) We request the government to sanction students who violate the law! (3) We request the government to protect the youth who are truly protecting the school! (4) Opposing internal strife is the demand of the common people. Opposing civil war is the slogan of the Communist Party. (5) Internal strife is caused by the Communist Party, and peace is destroyed by the Communist Party. (6) To oppose internal strife, the Communist Party must be eliminated first. To seek peace, the Communist Party must be eliminated first. (7) Patriotic students should not be deceived by the Communist Party and its followers. (8) Eating it all, making trouble completely, and destroying everything are the three major policies of the Communist Party to destroy the country. (9) The strike movement is a youth suicide movement. (10) We students want to stabilize the school. (11) We students want to eat and study. (12) All the demands of our students have been met. Continuing the strike is suicide. (13) We oppose being used as a tool for other people's political struggles. (14) We want to maintain the personality of pure, patriotic youth. (15) We are all for the country. (16) Everyone wants peace, only the Communist Party does not want peace. (17) Oppose turning the pure youth movement into a tool for political struggle.</p>
<h3>Maintenance of Studies Movement: Ten Propositions</h3>
<p>[Another report] University and specialized school students in this city feel uneasy about the student movements caused by the recent issues of the relocation of Great Britain University, the reform of Jiaotong University, and the public expenses of Zhongshan University, which have stirred up schools throughout the city, causing disturbances and preventing students from concentrating on their studies. Therefore, at 6:00 p.m. yesterday, a meeting was held at Datong University, attended by more than 40 representatives from 16 universities and specialized schools in the city. It was decided to organize and establish the Shanghai University and Specialized School Students' Joint Association for the Maintenance of Studies Movement, uniting students throughout the city to protect schools and resume classes in order to maintain their studies. A declaration was also issued, putting forward the following ten propositions: (1) We advocate strengthening student activities to implement our reasonable demands, but we believe that strikes are only a means, not an end, and not equivalent to a student movement. (2) We advocate that protecting schools and resuming classes is the right and obligation of every student, and it is also a specific goal to be striven for in the student movement. Resuming classes is to enrich the strength of our actions, and protecting schools is to preserve our base for work. (3) We advocate that the protection of freedom and the self-awareness of a sense of responsibility are relative. To demand freedom, one must first understand the meaning of freedom; to advocate the rule of law, one must first learn the habit of the rule of law. (4) We advocate that political reform and the improvement of people's livelihoods are not as easy as playing magic tricks, and they cannot be changed overnight. This requires time, manpower, and especially stability. (5) We advocate that students today must face reality, unite, and strengthen themselves, and strive to be the most progressive and greatest stabilizing force in society. (6) We advocate that always opposing internal strife is the only prerequisite for guaranteeing educational work and increasing educational funding, but we must go further and more concretely thoroughly examine the responsibility for internal strife and attack the culprits. (7) We advocate that the truly eternal sinners are only those who stir up trouble, incite hatred, and rely on violence. Mankind cannot prevent the permanent tragedy of division except through tolerance and understanding. (8) We advocate that young people who truly love the country and love mankind must first understand that the key to social happiness and national victory lies in the work of laboratories and libraries, and not in the dazzling of slogans. (9) We advocate that the power of the masses is greater than that of leaders. The most successful movement is the one that can best transmit social sympathy, and the expectations of teachers and parents are a most concerned form of sympathy. (10) We advocate that only reason can make us free. To learn to recognize the truth, we must first restore reason. This will make personal emotional impulses even more meaningless, and the significance of education will be even more important.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Jinan University, Shanghai Medical College, University of Shanghai, Soochow University, Datong University, Tongji University, and Sino-French Pharmaceutical College in this city successively experienced student strikes last week. As of yesterday, they have not yet subsided. However, among them, in addition to Fudan University and the fourth-year students of Jiaotong University, who resumed classes yesterday, Jinan University also resumed classes today.</p>
<p>Fudan Resumed Classes Yesterday</p>
<p>Fudan University resumed normal operations yesterday. Most students went to school for classes. Only more than 300 people who participated in the parade the day before yesterday asked the school for a day off. They will also attend classes as usual from today onwards. It is heard that the school authorities have accepted the request of the majority of students and will formally announce the dissolution of the overdue department and subject representative assembly within a few days. In the future, student activities in the school will be based on the existing student union as the legitimate student representative organization. According to reports, the "Department and Subject Representative Assembly" was a temporary organization established by the school to prepare for the May 5th Alumni Festival.</p>
<p>Jinan Resumes Classes Today</p>
<p>Since the strike at Jinan University last week, the university's president, Li Shouyong, telegraphed the Ministry of Education to firmly resign. School affairs are temporarily presided over by the Temporary School Affairs Maintenance Committee. Zhu Jiahua, the Minister of Education, specially sent Inspector Tong Dahong to Shanghai the day before yesterday to represent Minister Zhu and sincerely persuade him to stay. It is heard that Li may dispel his intention to resign and go to the school to work within a few days. The committee believes that students have wasted their studies during the strike period, and fourth-year students who are about to graduate are particularly affected. A meeting was held yesterday morning to decide to advise students to resume classes today.</p>
<p>University of Shanghai Students Return Home</p>
<p>The authorities of the University of Shanghai announced a few days ago that students would be divided into groups based on their final grades, with 70 points as the passing score. The Student Self-Government Association of the school believed that it was a disguised grade point system and still maintained a striking attitude to show opposition. Moreover, there were frequent disputes with some students who opposed the strike. In order to avoid unfortunate incidents among students, the school officially announced a temporary suspension of classes yesterday morning, and students could leave the school and return home, waiting for the school to notify them to attend classes. Lin, the acting president of the school, and Li Ming'an, a student of the Self-Government Association, and five others went to see Mayor Wu separately yesterday morning and afternoon to discuss and report on the matter. The students of the school still maintained close contact with the professors yesterday, exchanging opinions on the matter. Moreover, the "Committee Against Arbitrary Strikes" of the school changed its name to "University of Shanghai School Protection Student Union" and issued a declaration yesterday, explaining its special attitude and the school's painstaking efforts to care for the students, hoping that classes would resume as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Conflicting News from Datong</p>
<p>The Student Self-Government Association of Datong University has been on strike for several days to demand that the school authorities reform school administration, and their attitude has become increasingly firm. Yesterday afternoon, the association convened a general meeting of all representatives, and it was resolved to persist in the strike and to send representatives to Beijing for a petition tomorrow. According to another source, since the establishment of the School Administration Innovation Committee, most students have approved of resuming classes. The current graduating students have also begun to lead the class resumption movement, publishing a call to all students, calling on teachers and students to cooperate and resume classes as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Partial Resumption of Classes at Jiaotong University</p>
<p>Fourth-year students of Jiaotong University decided to resume classes from today because they are about to graduate. Students in other grades still go to school for self-study. Tongji University, Soochow University, Shanghai Medical College, and Sino-French Pharmaceutical College are still on strike. It is heard that they are discussing the issue of resuming classes separately.</p>

<h3>The Zheng Lun Team Won Four Consecutive Victories; Crushed St. John's Last Night; Champion Team Lost 65 to 25</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Luoyang Zheng Lun basketball team defeated this year's university basketball champion St. John's team again at the city gymnasium at 7:00 p.m. last night, resulting in a score of 65 to 25, and the first half was 31 to 9, creating a great record of four consecutive victories. The Zheng Lun team has always been at a disadvantage, because the Zheng Lun defense is tight, and it is difficult to get close to the basket. In the second half, the visiting team's new forces Chen Baoshu, Cheng Fei, and Ji Dexiang came on the field, and the new talents were extraordinary. St. John's star Bao Lei was not present, which was a great loss. Since arriving in Shanghai, the visiting team has won all four games, which is quite difficult. There were more than 800 spectators, and the shouts were incessant, and the situation was quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Absolute Advantage</p>
<p>Zheng Lun team leader Cai Zhongqiang presented a flag, which was accepted by St. John's team leader Zhu Mingxing. The players on the home team were Wu Xinyun, Wang Nianci, Tao Yingshi, Zhu Mingxing, and Zhuang Yikai. The players of the Zheng Lun team were Yu Ruizhang, Cai Zhongqiang, Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengjun, and Wang Binghuan. After the referees Chen Baolin and Wang Yiqiao announced the start of the game, Zheng Lun's Cai Zhongqiang broke through on the right wing, and Yu Ruizhang made three free throws in the middle. Cai added one point, and the score was suspended at seven points. St. John's called a timeout, and Hu Huizhao replaced Wang Nianci. Cai increased the score to nine points. Zhu Mingxing scored three points with one free throw and one shot. St. John's cheerleaders began to cheer. When the score was 13 to 3, Zhuang Yikai was replaced by Wu Xinyun. Although St. John's scored two goals by Tao Yingshi and Zhu Mingxing, Tu Wenlong, the opponent, made a single-arm shot and scored points continuously. Soon the score became 15 to 7. St. John's called another timeout, and Yu Erjia replaced Zhuang Yikai. The first half ended with 31 to 9, and Zheng Lun had an absolute advantage.</p>
<p>Four Consecutive Victories</p>
<p>During the break, St. John's concentrated its cheerleaders to shout wildly. In the second half, Chen Baoshu, Cheng Fei, and Ji Dezang of the Zheng Lun team replaced Liu Zhengjun, Wang Binghuan, and Cai Zhongqiang. St. John's also adjusted its lineup. At the beginning, Wu Xinyun scored two consecutive goals, and Yu Ruizhang of Zheng Lun added two points. Zhang Yikai and Wu Xinyun of St. John's scored again, making the score 35 to 17. When the score was 41 to 19, Wu Xinyun committed a foul and was "graduated." Hu Huizhao took his place. The performance of the new forces of the visiting team was not bad, and Ji Dezang was particularly lively. St. John's relied on Zhu Mingxing and Zhuang Yikai to make some decorations. In the last four minutes, the record had reached 61 to 25. St. John's lost good opportunities under the basket several times, which was regrettable. At the last moment, St. John's made its sixth timeout. The result was 65 to 25, and Zheng Lun won over St. John's.</p>

<h3>The Zheng Lun Schedule Is Rearranged</h3>
<p>The Zheng Lun basketball team has three remaining games in Shanghai, against the Giant Enkas and the League Champion Hua Lian. However, because the Giant requested a postponement, the schedule had to be rearranged. Moreover, the original game against Hua Lian on the 24th was cancelled because the team was invited to Xiamen and Hong Kong for matches and had already purchased plane tickets to leave Shanghai on the 23rd. Now, in order to have the opportunity to compete with the Zheng Lun team, the team has abandoned its original plan to go to Hong Kong and decided to rush back on the 28th and play against the Zheng Lun team on the 30th. The visiting team will also stay in Shanghai for two more days to prepare for the game. The rearranged schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>22nd: Zheng Lun vs. Enkas</p>

<h3>Rapid Advance of Cantonese and Cotton Mill Factions in Shanghai Stock Market; Chinese Shares See Another Surge Yesterday; Many Rumors of Wing On Textile's Capital Increase; Major Investors Spare No Effort to Plunge In</h3>
<p>Chinese shares saw stronger buying interest from the Cantonese and cotton mill factions yesterday. Wing On Textile, amid highly favorable rumors of capital increase, led the market, hitting its daily limit, followed by Sincere Co. However, general miscellaneous and small-to-medium-sized stocks lagged far behind. This was due to major investors focusing their full strength on Wing On Textile, leading to this situation.</p>
<p>Morning Opening</p>
<p>The market opened with various stocks showing fatigue. Lai On and Wing Foong first hit their daily limits, then Wing On Textile entered the scene. Numbers 89, and others vigorously bought, driving the opening price to a high of 6500 yuan. Rumors circulated regarding Wing On Textile's capital increase with varying figures (from 29 to 84 shares). After the opening, numbers 89, 162, 185, 4, and 97 all entered the market, repeatedly reaching their daily limit. Numbers 94, 105, 106, 82, 157, 219, 65, and 152 sold, pushing the price down below 6400 yuan. Numbers 186, 14, and 231 took advantage of the low prices to maintain their positions, showing some struggle. Numbers 154, 8, 100, 91, 30, 218, and 196 continuously sold off, and Wing On Textile fell to the 6000 yuan mark. Numbers 4, 8, 162, 76, and 89 bought up to 6380 yuan. Numbers 94, 155, 197, 36, 65, and 223 sold again. Match, China Silk, and King Lun all hit their daily limit declines, and prices retreated into the 6100 yuan range. Numbers 61, 105, 106, 235, 143, 162, and 17 bought in, and Cantonese investors vigorously purchased, pushing the price back up to 6500 yuan after 11:00 AM. Numbers 213, 226, 75, and 65 sold off, retreating to 6380 yuan. Later, the rumor of a million-yuan parallel line of cost price resurfaced. Numbers 155, 143, 152, 142, 183, 35, and 85 jointly purchased, and Wing On Textile and Lai On also hit their daily limit increases. The midday close rose again to around 6530 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Wing On Textile hit its daily limit increase, Sincere Co., Meiya, and New Kwong slightly rose, New China fell by half, Keen Hing was flat, Wing On Public Utility fell by half a percentage point, and King Fook slightly declined. In terms of spot transactions, Wing On Textile rose by slightly less than 10%, Sincere Co. and Meiya rose by half a percentage point, Wing On Public Utility and Keen Hing each fell by half a percentage point, and New Kwong and King Fook slightly increased. In terms of less active stocks, Lai On hit its daily limit increase, Wing Foong rose to its daily limit before slightly retreating, Match, China Silk, and King Lun hit their daily limit declines before recovering somewhat, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank slightly rose, and the rest fell by half a percentage point.</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>The market outside had already been calling for higher prices. Wing On Textile immediately hit its limit upon entering the market. Numbers 117, 153, 112, and 185 all bought in, and Lai On, Wing Foong, and Wing On Public Utility successively hit their daily limits. Wing On Textile also reached its limit for spot transactions, and subsequent trading had to be conducted in the gray market. Numbers 91, 185, 47, 82, and 183 all bought in. Meiya and Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank also reached their daily limits. Sincere Co. was bid up to its daily limit by numbers 126, 4, and 69, but later, due to the return of lower prices in the off-exchange market, it was sold off by numbers 24, 186, and 144, and the bid price fell to 6800 yuan. After 3:15 PM, numbers 224, 152, and 213 came in to buy, and the price rose again to above 7000 yuan. However, trading was limited due to the 1.8 billion yuan withdrawn by the four banks and two bureaus. As a result, compared to the previous close, Wing On Textile, Sincere Co., and Wing On Public Utility hit their daily limit increases. Meiya hit its daily limit increase before retreating somewhat, rising by slightly less than 10%. New China and Keen Hing slightly rose, and New Kwong rose by slightly less than 10%, King Fook rose by slightly more than half a percentage point. In terms of spot transactions, Wing On Textile and Sincere Co. hit their daily limit increases. Meiya hit its daily limit increase before retreating, rising by slightly less than 10%. The same was true for Wing On Public Utility, which rose by about 10%. Keen Hing and King Fook slightly rose, and New Kwong rose by slightly more than half a percentage point. In terms of less active stocks, Wing Foong, Lai On, and Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank hit their daily limits. Da Tung, Match, China Silk, and King Lun hit their daily limit declines before recovering somewhat. The former rose by half a percentage point, while the latter three slightly declined or fell by half a percentage point. New Asia had no transactions in the aftermarket and still fell by half a percentage point. In the off-exchange market, all old stocks were flat or weak except for Chapei, which slightly rose.</p>
<h3>Continued Decline in Consolidated Bonds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of government bonds exceeded demand, and retail investors liquidated their holdings. Consolidated C bonds opened at 14000 yuan, with a high of 14300 yuan, a low of 12900 yuan, and finally struggled at 13700 yuan. Room 550 bought in, while room 360 sold. Transactions amounted to approximately 5 million yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, A, B, and D bonds each fell by 1500 yuan, Consolidated C bonds fell by 1000 yuan, and Consolidated E bonds also fell by 1400 yuan.</p>
<h3>Mixed Performance of Foreign Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks stabilized in the morning due to the reduction in Shanghai Electric shares. Ewo Cotton Mill opened at 73000 yuan and struggled above 72000 yuan at midday close, starting from 71000 yuan. Money exchangers sold slightly, while securities firms and Cantonese investors bought in. The afternoon's activity in Chinese shares was still driven by securities firms absorbing shares. Ewo Cotton Mill then rose independently to around 75000 yuan at the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Ewo Cotton Mill and Ewo Property each rose by half a percentage point, and the performance of the remaining stocks was mixed.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Continues to Rise; Top-Grade White Rice Reaches New High; Top-Quality Goods Priced at 330,000 Yuan per Stone</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The rice market continued to rise due to reported price increases in the production areas. According to rice merchants, the price increases in the production areas are due to the busy farming season and the shortage of stored rice. Yesterday, 7334 stones arrived at the North Shanghai market, and 5211 stones arrived at the South Shanghai market. Top-grade white rice was priced as high as 318,000 yuan to 330,000 yuan. Medium-grade rice was priced at 310,000 yuan to 315,000 yuan. Lower-grade rice was priced at 300,000 yuan to 303,000 yuan.</p>

<p>[Further Report] Flour rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan yesterday, while wheat bran, due to oversupply, retreated by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake first rose and then retreated, lacking the strength to rise further, and finally slightly increased by 300 to 1,000 yuan. In the oil market, raw oil from Cantonese suppliers was sluggish and weak, and the market was flat and tired. The supply of soybean oil was still acceptable, and there were no temporary changes. Vegetable oil and sesame oil had little fluctuation, but refined oil rebounded by 10,000 yuan. Due to 30,000 to 40,000 bags of soybeans arriving in Shanghai from the Northeast, sentiment softened, and prices steadily declined, decreasing by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybeans remained dull and sluggish, hovering in a tired state. Corn fell by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and red sorghum also fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. There was some activity in the retail trade of red beans, and prices were similar. Raw peanuts remained flat, and sesame seeds were firm for high-quality goods but sluggish for lower-quality goods.</p>
<p>[Further Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Deng Geng ship returned to Shanghai from Yingkou yesterday, carrying 600 tons of soybean cake and 1,000 tons of scrap iron. Another report stated that large quantities of rice and flour could arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>
<h3>Joint Tea Association Revises Tea Loan Conditions</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] For the 36th year tea loan, the original requirement was that tea factories could apply for loans only when the quantity of raw tea purchased reached 300 dan for green tea and 100 dan for black tea. It has now been learned that the Joint Treasury of the Four Banks has revised this provision to allow applications when the quantity of raw tea purchased reaches 100 dan for either green or black tea.</p>
<h3>Demand for Dried Green Tea is Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market, export firms in Shanghai tried to suppress prices due to tight prices from abroad, while sellers were unwilling to sell at low prices due to rising costs. As a result, both sides returned to a stalemate, with very few transactions and a superficial process. Sales of domestic tea were still continuous, and prices remained in a state of buyer-seller negotiation. However, last year's Anhui-produced dried green tea, of which there was little stock, was highly sought after, and the market was active.</p>
<h3>Production Loan Statistics: Two-Thirds Have Been Recovered</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] According to statistics released by the Production Loan Inspection Team of the Joint Treasury of the Four Banks, a total of 330 applications were received from factories for production loans, with a total loan amount of 65,718,000,000 yuan. Among them, the cotton dyeing and weaving industry accounted for the largest share, with 128 applications and a loan amount of 31.002 billion yuan. The chemical and pharmaceutical industry was next, with 50 applications and a loan amount of 8.437 billion yuan. The machinery and hardware industry was third, with 36 applications and a loan amount of 4.575 billion yuan. As for the loan amount range, the most common was 100 million to 180 million yuan, with 98 companies. This was followed by 500 billion to 950 billion yuan, with 79 companies. There was one high-value loan of 1.6 billion yuan and another of 1.5 billion yuan. Two-thirds of the total loan amount has now been recovered, and the remaining one-third has been approved for extension.</p>
<h3>Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association Requests Removal of Controls on Yarn and Cloth Shipments to Hankou</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, in order to appeal for the removal of controls on shipments of yarn and cloth to Hankou, sent a letter to the Cotton Control Committee yesterday, stating that the difficulties faced by manufacturers in transporting yarn and cloth had been repeatedly raised and requested for the lifting of the restrictions. Currently, the sales of cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai are sluggish, with signs of saturation, while there is strong demand and a sense of shortage in South China and North China. The imbalance between supply and demand has had a significant impact. All factories in the industry are facing the threat of suffocation and closure. However, it has been reported that simplified procedures for applying for the shipment of yarn and cloth to Hankou have recently been promulgated, without prior discussion at the general meeting, which is deeply alarming. The 20th board meeting of the association discussed this and concluded that Hankou is the center of transit in Central China, and inland ports such as Yichang, Chongqing, and Chengdu all rely on Hankou as a centralized distribution station. Further restrictions would be tantamount to strangling the throat of Shanghai and other ports. The application procedures are unacceptable and should be immediately revoked. At the same time, it is hoped that the prohibitions on shipments of yarn and cloth to South China, Hebei, and the Northeast will be lifted as soon as possible to alleviate the difficulties of businesses.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, yarn prices declined because money supply was tight, cloth prices were stable, dyeing and weaving factories stopped buying yarn after making a few purchases, and buying interest from customers was weak. The market also had an abundant supply of goods, leading to a fall in bid prices. The last price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 12.35 million yuan, down 50,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse yarn was 7.05 million yuan, down 250,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn was 6.8 million yuan, down 300,000 yuan. The prices of other brands of 16-count yarn also fell across the board.</p>
<h3>Cloth Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, the price of dark-colored 190 Tulin cloth increased because the price of grey cloth rose, and the cost of cloth produced by private factories increased due to the continuous rise in grain prices. As a result, the Tulin cloth market was very active at the opening. The last price of 190 Zhijiang Tulin cloth reached 550,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 40,000 yuan from the previous day. Brands such as Chick, Longevity, and Unity also rose by around 20,000 yuan. Yuanfu silk was in short supply, and 42-count Longevity silk was priced as high as 365,000 yuan, an increase of 35,000 yuan. The new shipment of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth sold quickly at a price of 301,600 yuan, down 2,000 yuan. The prices of Five Blessings, Blue Chick, and Color Ball brands also fell by 5,000 to 8,000 yuan. The prices of other fine twills, drills, and Yuan cloth all declined by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The China Textile Construction Company sold over 30 types of cloth yesterday. One type, Five Blessings fine cloth, was priced at 260,000 yuan, but there were few buyers. The Blue Chick and Special Silver Moon Flower and Bird fine cloth, 60-yard Valencia, were limited to dye factories only.</p>
<h3>Mixed Performance of Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market opened with brisk purchases from industry players, and prices continued to rise. Among them, cigarettes from the Yizhong Company saw a larger price increase, and Chinese cigarettes also showed slight firmness. In the market, British American Tobacco (BAT) cigarettes opened at 7.55 million yuan. Due to limited selling and active buying, the price hovered high at 650,000 yuan at midday. In the afternoon, the market momentum weakened due to the China Tobacco Company processing shipments and tightening credit. In addition, long positions were unwound, causing prices to fall back. As a result, the price of 10-pack BAT cigarettes was 7.25 million yuan at the close, down 280,000 yuan from the previous day. Old Knife cigarettes were 6.9 million yuan, with several boxes traded. Changhou cigarettes also fell back by 60,000 yuan to 6.8 million yuan. The prices of other Chinese cigarettes showed mixed performance.</p>
<p>[Further Report] The China Tobacco Company began processing shipments yesterday, with two boxes each of Armor and Axe brands priced at 15 million yuan for Full Armor cards. Half as much was allocated for B cards, and half each of Double Axe and Jinlu cigarettes were allocated for C cards, priced at 3.75 million yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Yuanli Tobacco Store on Guangdong Road purchased a box of Keleek cigarettes, totaling 200 cans, priced at 56,500 yuan per can.</p>
<h3>Actual Sales Clients Absorb; Rayon Starts Weak, Ends Strong; Factory Silk Prices Drop, Very Few Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market started weak but ended strong. 120-count Kaoshan Glossy rayon opened at 16.5 million yuan. Due to absorption by actual sales clients, it rose again, quickly reaching 800,000 yuan. At the midday close, it reached 7 million yuan. In the afternoon, the bid price fell back by 100,000 yuan, finally closing at the same price as the previous day. New shipments of 120-count Peacock Globe rayon were priced at 6.6 million yuan. 75-count Semi-Gloss rayon prices remained stable without change.</p>
<p>There were virtually no transactions in factory silk. Although the bid prices showed some weakness yesterday, there were very few deals. C-grade silk was still traded in the market yesterday, with prices the same as the previous day. 5-day forward tickets were 20.09 million yuan. There were no transactions for other grades.</p>
<p>Because the raw materials for silk fabrics were stable and actual sales were sluggish, the factory quotations remained mostly unchanged. In the market yesterday, the bid price for silk quilt covers was slightly lower by 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Dasheng plaid crepe opened at 31,200 yuan in the morning, with a minimum of 1,000 yuan. Later, due to demand exceeding supply, it rose again to 1,500 yuan and was sold.</p>
<p>[Further Report] The Silk Weaving Industry Association of the Fourth District is preparing to set up a market at its new location on Taiwan Road in order to improve the technology of its member factories and plan for the production and sale of products. The 7th meeting of directors and supervisors appointed 25 people, including Cai Xintao, Tong Xinbo, Song Baolin, and Shen Boming, as preparation members and scheduled the first preparation meeting for 3 PM today to discuss the progress.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Prices Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the initial trading of daily necessities and soaps was smooth, but the willingness to supply at high prices was unabated, and prices were stable with a slightly soft tone. 120-piece Huang Xiangmao soap rose from 263,000-264,000 yuan to 267,000-268,000 yuan. At midday close, there were many transactions at 266,000-267,000 yuan. In the afternoon, supply and demand were flat, and prices fell slightly. The initial price was 265,000 yuan, and the final price was 260,000 yuan. There were few increases or decreases in matches and candles. It was heard that the supply of kerosene was plentiful, and the inventory was not small, so the market was stable. High-quality barrel-packed needles were priced at 630,000-640,000 yuan, canned needles at 87,000-88,000 yuan, and Asia at 83,000-84,000 yuan.</p>
<p>[Further Report] Yesterday, Wanli Store in the South City sold 50 boxes of new Huang Xiangmao soap from South China Commercial Company for a price of 261,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bituminous Coal Slightly Active</h3>
<p>The bituminous coal market saw slightly active trading as actual sales clients absorbed at lower prices. The market for white coal remained firm, but demand was slightly weaker. Due to the large number of buyers in the production areas, coke prices were reported to have increased, but the purchased coke could not be transported to Shanghai temporarily due to transportation difficulties. As a result, Shanghai owners used the excuse of higher production area prices to raise prices.</p>
<h3>Hardware Market Conditions</h3>
<p>The prices and sales of various hardware products this week are all on a safe path. Only the selling price of wire nails remains unchanged, while the price of iron wire is still doubled, due to increased labor costs.</p>
<h3>China National Tea Corporation Actively Promotes Tea in Taiwan</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yan Jingwei, General Manager of the China National Tea Corporation, told reporters yesterday that the company's business is mainly to concentrate the strength of Chinese tea merchants to promote tea abroad in a unified manner. The business center is currently focused on Taiwan. Branch companies in Zhejiang and Anhui will be established in Hangzhou and Tunxi, respectively. The Taiwan branch and crude and refined tea factories have been opened for three months, and business is being actively promoted. He said that in order to handle the remaining tea from the 35th year, the government has now established a quality assessment committee composed of the Central Bank, the China Farmers Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, the China National Tea Corporation, and the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association. The committee has hired three Chinese tea masters and two foreign tea masters. The work steps are to first assess the prices of various grades of tea and then purchase them. The estimated purchase amount for the remaining tea from the previous year is US$5 million, but after evaluation, it is estimated that US$1.6 million can be purchased. The government will now negotiate a purchase price to give tea merchants a reasonable profit so that the remaining tea can be exported. As for the purchase plan for the 36th year, it was originally set at US$25 million. However, as the Qihong tea purchase period has passed, it is estimated that only about US$15 million worth of Tunlv and Pinglv tea can be purchased. The tea loan program for this year was discussed by the relevant agencies today (20th). Representatives said that although the China Farmers Bank is planning to provide tea loans, no tea merchants have applied for the loans, so the loan methods need to be improved. Generally, the loan-for-production method will be adopted. It is planned that tea loans will account for approximately 100 billion yuan in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, and approximately 100 billion yuan in Hubei and Hunan and Fujian. It is heard that the guarantee methods for tea merchants will be guaranteed by the Fuzhou Tea Export Association in Fujian, the Hankou Tea Export Association in Hubei and Hunan, and the Shanghai Tea Export Association in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi. He said that the tea loan plan will continue to be discussed today.</p>
<h3>News of US Dollar Bond Subscription and Sale</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that of the US$10 million in US dollar bonds subscribed to by the Bank of China, in addition to the US$7.5 million that has already been paid, the remaining US$2.5 million will be transferred in Shanghai today, with Tianjin paying US$1.27 million, Chongqing paying US$980,000, and Xiamen paying US$220,000.</p>
<h3>Sixth District Paper Industry Requests Relaxation of Wood Pulp Import Quota; Industry and Commerce Guidance Office Plans to Discuss Supply Issues</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Industry and Commerce Guidance Office plans to invite representatives from paper mills and newspapers this week to convene a meeting on the supply of newspapers and other related issues. On the 17th of this month, the Sixth District Paper Industry Association sent a letter to the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, putting forward five minimum requirements for the quota of wood pulp in the US$4.5 million allocated for the second phase of paper and wood pulp imports:</p>
<p>(1) In the first phase quota of US$3.45 million, wood pulp accounted for US$450,000, only one-tenth of the actual demand. The excess US$1.05 million from this quota should be fully allocated to wood pulp.</p>
<p>(2) All paper mills are willing to sacrifice their capital to produce 600 tons of newsprint per month in exchange for the foreign exchange quota that newspapers should receive. It is found that the first phase import quota for newspapers is US$850,000. Based on the current international price, 3,080 English tons of newsprint can be ordered. Therefore, producing 600 tons of newsprint can earn US$165,600 in foreign exchange. In addition, the import duties and freight should be paid by the newspapers to the settlement bank of the wood pulp set by the factories.</p>
<p>(3) In the first phase wood pulp allocation, the National Resources Commission (NRC)-affiliated paper mills took away a total of US$100,000, resulting in limited gains for the factories in the Sixth District. If the NRC-affiliated factories and other paper mills in other regions cannot undertake the production, the second phase cannot obtain it as usual.</p>
<p>(4) Some factories in the Sixth District are outside the power supply range of the Shanghai Power Company and need to have power outages for four hours a day and one or two days a week, resulting in significant losses. It is proposed that the Guidance Office negotiate with the Shanghai Power Company to provide more electricity to other power plants during power outage times so that the factories can shorten the downtime caused by power outages and increase production.</p>
<p>(5) In order to maintain a monthly production of 600 tons, it is necessary to allocate US$1.5 million in foreign exchange for wood pulp and US$486,800 in foreign exchange for newspaper exchange for three months so that each factory can order more than 7,000 tons of wood pulp in the months of May, June, and July. If the above foreign exchange cannot be obtained, the amount of newspapers supplied each month will be subject to further negotiation.</p>

<h3>Mo Te-hui Visits Zhang Xueliang: Post-Visit Conversation at Grass Mountain Guesthouse</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun, Taipei, 19th (Airmail)</p>
<p>The news of Zhang Xueliang's arrival in Taiwan was first revealed by this newspaper in Shanghai last November 2nd. However, reporters have repeatedly inquired about his life in Taiwan, but only received fragmented information; even that fragmented information was not allowed to be disclosed.</p>
<p>In the past six months, only Chen Yi, Yang Sen, and Mo Te-hui have been able to visit him. Mr. Mo made a special trip to Taiwan to see Mr. Zhang and stayed in Hsinchu for a week before returning to the provincial capital yesterday. After being hosted at a banquet by Chairman Wei, he temporarily resided at the Grass Mountain Guesthouse. The reporter braved the rain and drove there for a lengthy conversation lasting an hour and a half. His travel-worn mood had clearly replaced the joy of meeting. Zhang Xueliang (center), enjoying himself playing tennis, with Mo Te-hui (right), Miss Zhao Si, and Commissioner Liu. The lower corner features Zhang's inscription, signed Yi'an, May 16th, of the 6th year.</p>
<p>"Hanqing (another alias is Yi'an) is staying at Inoue Hot Spring, which is still a three-hour car ride from Hsinchu," said Commissioner Mo. "Inoue Hot Spring is now called Qingquan Township. The car route is winding and rugged, perhaps nearly a thousand feet above sea level. It's just like Grass Mountain, nestled in the mountains, with a view of the Pacific Ocean. The sea is quite windy, and the climate is similar to Taipei." In his conversation, the reporter gained a better understanding of the environment of Inoue Hot Spring. It was originally an area inhabited by aborigines (referred to by the Japanese as mountain tribes). There is an aboriginal elementary school with fifty or sixty students, taught by an aboriginal youth and a Hakka youth teacher. The students can already speak Mandarin and sing party songs. In this mountain village, there is only a police sanatorium, a Japanese-style wooden bungalow with tatami mats and glass windows, very clean, but without luxurious amenities like velvet carpets. That is where Hanqing resides. It is a remote and isolated village without any venues or shops. The closest places are Shangping, ten miles away, or Zhudong, twenty miles away, which is an industrial area and an export point for timber from the Lucang Mountains. Along the way, one can see wooden horses carrying timber, transported out of the mountains by human labor.</p>
<p>Regulated Life: Reading, Playing Ball, Bathing</p>
<p>The reporter was most concerned about Mr. Zhang's life. Commissioner Mo said, "It's very regular, and he's not lonely!" He gets up at seven every morning, reads and writes in the morning, plays tennis in the afternoon, and takes a hot spring bath. The regulated life has clearly improved his health. "Who does he play ball with?"</p>
<p>"There's Miss Zhao, as well as Commissioner Liu, and the guards!" Regarding Miss Zhao Si, he added, "Miss Zhao Si's name is Yidi. She has beautiful handwriting, and she copies all of his reading notes. Her father was the director of the Jinpu Railway around the eleventh or twelfth year of the Republic, named Zhao something, I can't recall." The reporter recalled that on Mr. Zhang's first day in Taiwan last year, a director of the Governor-General's Office hosted a reception and inquired about railway matters, mentioning the third Miss he was pursuing, which made Mr. Zhang somewhat embarrassed at the time. It is not known exactly how old Miss Zhao Si is, but her child is already seventeen years old!</p>
<p>Yu Fengzhi, she should still be in the United States now. It is said that they have not corresponded for half a year. In addition to thanking Madam Chiang, Mr. Kong, and Mr. Song, the letters Mr. Zhang asked Commissioner Mo to carry also included Mr. Zhang's family letters. His elderly mother is still in Tianjin!</p>
<p>Studying the History of the Ming Dynasty, Eager to Teach</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang is currently studying the history of the Ming Dynasty, continuing his research from Guizhou. He has excerpted the historical records of the twelve emperors of the Ming Dynasty, and has gained many insights. He very much wants to have an opportunity to learn from the historians he admires. He firmly believes that scholars are the most enduring figures in history, and that scholarship can control people! He gave Commissioner Mo a book list to purchase, and these three are undoubtedly those he admires: Wang Chongwu's "Supplementary Evidence of the Deeds of Emperor Renzong and Xuanzong of the Ming Dynasty," Rong Zhaozu's "History of Thought in the Ming Dynasty,"</p>
<p>Jian Bozan's "On the Development of Overseas Trade in the Ming Dynasty; On the Struggle of the Chinese People Against the Tartars; On the Struggle of the Second Government of the Southern Ming Dynasty; The History of the Ming Dynasty After the Fall of Liaoning; On the Eunuchs and Eunuch Politics of the Ming Dynasty."</p>
<p>At the same time, he is very interested in teaching in the mountain village. He hopes to enter the Academia Sinica. He is tired of military and political affairs, and has become indifferent to them. During this stage of moving from Guiyang to Taiwan, perhaps influenced by the Yangming School of thought, he has undergone an extreme ideological transformation. This transformation has shifted his beliefs and inclinations towards pure academic research. He hopes to appear as a scholar, abandoning his previous way of life.</p>
<p>Rumors Abound, Mr. Mo Hesitates to Answer</p>
<p>Speaking of Wang Yangming, Commissioner Mo recalled a couplet: "Three enemies reside in Siam, the ancient caves and deep mountains contain the ultimate joy;</p>
<p>Once awakened, literary arts and military strategies are complete." This is a couplet inside the Yangming Temple, without a signature. People say it was written by Mr. Zhang and is a portrayal of him, but he denies it.</p>
<p>Since 1936, after Mr. Zhang was court-martialed, he went from Xikou to Huangshan, Xiangxi, Jiangxi, Xiuwen in Guizhou, Xifeng in 1944, and then to Taiwan in 1946. During this time, Mo Te-hui was his only visitor. Old friends reminisced, and although there were no electric lights in the mountain village in Hsinchu, heartfelt conversations by candlelight relieved Mr. Zhang of much sorrow!</p>
<p>In the mountain village, life is not Japanese-style; they still sleep on beds. Mr. Zhang likes to wear velvet shirts and khaki trousers. There is not always chicken meat every day, but there is always chicken soup. Fortunately, he is not particular about food!</p>
<p>Because there are many rumors in Shanghai that Mr. Zhang will take up an important position in the Northeast, when the reporter inquired about this, Mr. Mo hesitated for a long time. He said, "How can I answer this? Freedom, or lack thereof, this question poses a difficult problem for an old man."</p>
<p>Taipei Incident: Bitterly Enduring Five Days with Sweet Potatoes</p>
<p>The Taipei February 28th Incident shook the entire province, but there was no disturbance in this corner. Three days later, they received confirmation of the unrest, the telephone was out of order, but the details were unclear. Later, the aboriginal police advised them not to go down the mountain, so they bitterly endured five days with sweet potatoes.</p>
<p>At that time, they feared an attack by rioters, using the cliffs as a stronghold. The police sanatorium was unable to resist. But they still had strength, and more importantly, the mountain compatriots who got along very well with them, so they had nothing to fear!</p>
<p>Commissioner Mo expressed his views on the February 28th Incident, but when the reporter wanted to ask about Mr. Zhang's views, he remained silent, saying, "His views are different!"</p>
<p>Commissioner Mo was immersed in memories, and his spirits were still very high. He believes he has gained something this time. He instructed the reporter to tell his friends in Beijing and Shanghai that he would take the Zhongxing wheel on the 23rd to return to Shanghai, because he had to attend the Senate! Before parting, he gave us very precious recent photos taken with Mr. Zhang, specially printed for the readers of this newspaper.</p>
<p>One part of the Fudian Iron Works Machine Shop (Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu)</p>
<h3>Impression of the Fudian Iron Works: The Largest Factory in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu, Fuzhou, 21st (Airmail)</p>
<p>Entering Fujian Province, it is not easy to see rows of chimneys or hear the roar of motors. This piece of land of 120,000 square kilometers is entirely a quiet agricultural society. If there is any industry, it is only decorated with handicraft workshops that boast "omnipotent hands." Machine factories, the so-called mother of industry, are as rare as phoenix feathers. Before and during the war, some factories in Fuzhou and Xiamen that met the factory regulations, such as the Mawei Shipyard, the Fuzhou Enterprise Company Iron Works, and the Xiamen Iron Works, have now all closed down. The remaining Fudian Iron Works can be considered the only one. Now, this fragile, only large factory has fallen into a situation where it can hardly be maintained. This should be something that deserves our attention!</p>
<p>In terms of scale, the Fudian Iron Works is indeed the largest factory in Fujian Province. All kinds of power machinery, engines, and agricultural processing machinery needed in Fujian Province are manufactured by the factory, so the factory has almost become the source of all mechanical power in Fujian Province. In order to understand its current situation, the reporter went to the factory site in Xinhang, Fuzhou, for a few hours of inspection.</p>
<p>The Minbei Jian'ou Bridge, built by the Fudian Iron Works, is 600 feet long.</p>
<p>The Golden Age Is Longed For</p>
<p>More than thirty years ago, the factory was originally a mechanical repair shop affiliated to the Fuzhou Electric Company. Later, it gradually purchased a large number of machine tools and many precision instruments from Germany and the United States, forming a rudimentary scale. It was not until 1934 that a factory was formally established, undertaking the production of various machinery ordered by various parties. In the spring of 1939, it moved inland to Nanping. During these years, due to the suspension of maritime transport and the inability to import foreign goods, and because many factories in the coastal provinces were destroyed by artillery fire, the factory became the largest iron factory with the most significant scale in the southeast, and was entrusted by agencies in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei provinces to manufacture steam engines, hydraulic machines, diesel engines, charcoal machines, machine tools, agricultural machinery, and bridge towers to meet wartime needs. The power machines and machine tools such as planers, drilling machines, and lathes needed by the Southeast Regional Ordnance Factories of the Ordnance Department of the Ministry of Military Administration were also supplied by the factory. At that time, its business was extremely prosperous and its reputation spread far and wide. People in the factory still enjoy recalling it today.</p>
<p>Hard Struggle, Unity of Upper and Lower Levels</p>
<p>According to factory director Liu Dongye, the historical process of the Fudian Factory is as arduous as the growth of the entire Chinese industry. After the factory was moved back to Fuzhou after the victory, its business conditions were far from what they used to be. Repairs were more common than manufacturing, reflecting the phenomenon of economic depression in the society. Coupled with the impact of soaring prices, working capital gradually decreased due to currency depreciation. Therefore, it was even more impossible to pre-produce various finished products for sale, and only relied on the income from sporadic repairs of machine parts to barely maintain it. According to factory director Liu, one of the most valuable assets of the factory is the technical staff with more than ten or even twenty or thirty years of experience. Because the workers' technology is skilled, their products can all meet the standards, which is praised by all parties. Because of the factory's shortage of funds, there have been cases of arrears of wages, but there has never been a strike or slowdown. Labor and management cooperate well, and the upper and lower levels are united. Everyone yearns for the day when "chimneys are like forests and whistles are like thunder." This spirit is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Plans to Manufacture Agricultural Tools in the Future</p>
<p>In today's increasingly severe economic crisis, industrialization still seems to be a long way off. Promoting rural mechanization and improving agricultural productivity are the most important tasks at present. Moreover, Fujian is a mountainous province. The streams in northern Fujian converge into the Minjiang River and flow down. The streams in the central and western regions converge into the Jiulong River and enter the sea. Every spring and summer, during the rainy season, the vast areas downstream suffer from floods. In the autumn, there is drought and water shortage, and agricultural products suffer greatly. In order to adapt to the needs of this situation, the factory plans to manufacture a large number of small power machines, mobile irrigation, pumping machines, Japanese-style deep plows, and all agricultural processing machinery such as rice mills, flour mills, oil presses, and tea makers starting this year to supply farmland irrigation and drainage and local product processing. The factory has requested the assistance of the Fujian Provincial Government to allocate funds from agricultural loans to be used by the factory to manufacture a large number of mobile irrigation machines and lend them to farmers through the Agricultural Production and Marketing Cooperatives in order to increase agricultural production and improve the current situation of Fujian's huge food imports.</p>
<p>In addition, the factory's engineers have recently boldly tried to manufacture an automatic power machine that does not require fuel based on advanced physical principles. If successful, it will be enough to shock the global scientific community.</p>
<p>The Fate of the Factory Depends on the 500 Million Loan</p>
<p>Since the factory has determined that its manufacturing business will focus on agricultural tools, the first major problem it faces is the source of production funds. In March of this year, it prepared a plan and requested a production loan of 500 million yuan from the Siliang Finance and Business Office through the Provincial Department of Construction as a condition for realizing the above plan. Whether or not it is approved is related to the future of the factory. The factory is purely a commercial joint-stock company and has no huge capital reserves. It only relies on business income to maintain itself, and the profit from manufacturing machinery is usually meager. Factory director Liu told the reporter very sadly: If the government cannot provide timely assistance in loans and sales, the factory will easily be destroyed in the storm. Once it closes down, not only will there be no decent factory in Fujian Province in the future, but also a large number of skilled technical staff will be scattered. It will not be easy to gather them again at that time, and it will be too late to provide relief. He painstakingly explained the factory's difficulties and future plans to the reporter. Mr. Liu taught at Peking University for many years, has the demeanor of a scholar, and is also a person with a strong sense of career. He relies on him to run around and maintain the current situation. On the way back, the reporter silently thought: The country is in great trouble, and many factories are no longer smoking. This fragile industrial cluster already feels that it cannot be maintained, but no matter how poor the country is, it should fully support an industry that can improve people's lives. Factories are our hope, our dawn!</p>
<h3>Silkworm Experiment Guarantee: Promotion and Development in Wuhu</h3>
<p>— Xingxinghu Shi, Wuxing, 10th (Express News)</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, whenever someone came to the countryside of Wuxing in the spring, they would be surprised: everywhere was green, an endless expanse of green, and everywhere they could smell a vigorous and thriving atmosphere. This was the mulberry forest, the most important lifeline for the farmers in the water town.</p>
<p>During the war, the enemy and puppets and guerrilla remnants destroyed the lifeline of the farmers. In order to prevent the mulberry forest from sheltering our guerrillas, to use mulberry trees as firewood, and to destroy our rural resources, they constantly cut down mulberry trees, turning the dense mulberry forests into barren land. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, according to the results of a detailed survey, the number of mulberry trees in the rural areas of Wuxing decreased by more than 70%. Taking Linghu District alone, the loss of mulberry trees was no less than five million.</p>
<p>The Construction Association Improves Sericulture</p>
<p>Among the approximately 120,000 residents in the Linghu District of Wuxing, more than 85% rely on silk production to make a living. In the past, the development of the silk industry created the prosperity of Linghu. The local silk of the Golden Unicorn and Jade Unicorn brands made a glorious page in the history of export trade. However, now, the sharp decline in the silk industry has formed a widespread and profound poverty among the people of Linghu District. After the victory, the farmers knew that there was hope for the export of silk, and everyone wanted to raise more silkworms, but there was not enough mulberry leaves, silkworm eggs, silkworm-raising tools, or funds... They were still unable to increase production. At the same time, the backward methods of raising silkworms and the poor quality of local silk were two major obstacles.</p>
<p>The rural work of the Linghu Construction Association started with improving sericulture. In the past year or so, they have sent silkworm eggs, sent mulberry seedlings, set up communal breeding rooms, sent experts to the countryside to guide, bought up pests on mulberry trees, trained sericulture personnel, and provided loans, seeds, and firewood. This spring, more than 25,000 silkworm egg sheets were loaned out, dozens of communal breeding rooms were established, and more than 100 instructors were dispatched. However, due to the large area and large population of the entire district, the strength of the association was ultimately limited. Therefore, although the number of farmers who benefited was very large, the help they received was often not very great. This was because the strength was too dispersed.</p>
<p>Do Not Make Local Silk, Do Not Raise Summer Silkworms</p>
<p>After repeated discussions and research, the association decided on a method, which was to focus on the actual needs of the local area, select the key points of work, aim high and start small, start with demonstrations, and then gradually expand until it is popularized throughout the area. Initially, they planned to establish a "Sericulture Experiment Township" in Linghu District to promote sericulture improvement work. Later, they considered that the population of a township was quite large and it was difficult to reach a consensus, so they decided to change it to "Experiment Guarantee." In the first phase, they selected five townships from the fourteen townships in the entire district, and selected five guarantees from the five townships. As long as the silkworm farmers in these five guarantees can earnestly achieve the two conditions of "Do Not Make Local Silk, Do Not Raise Summer Silkworms," they can enjoy many benefits, such as priority replanting of mulberry seedlings, setting up demonstration mulberry fields, providing mulberry land fertilizer loans, ordering excellent silkworms on their behalf, donating autumn silkworm breeds, and sending personnel to guide them. All the silkworm farmers in the guarantee will jointly promote spring silkworms and raise them together, baking cocoons on their behalf without compensation, introducing them to practice at the breeding farm, participating in sericulture personnel training classes, and giving priority to introducing them to practice at the silk factory. At the same time, in order to encourage farmers not to make local silk, thereby developing the silk reeling industry and striving for export trade, it is further stipulated that when silkworm farmers sell cocoons, in addition to giving all the compensation, a "Cocoon Sale Reward Certificate" will also be issued, stating the quantity and quality of cocoons sold, and it is scheduled to be presented to the association on the fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month of last year to receive the bonus. This method is also applicable to silkworm farmers outside the experimental guarantee. In addition, in order to facilitate farmers to store dry cocoons, a warehouse was opened in the Green Tree Dangli of Linghu to store them on their behalf for mortgage.</p>
<p>In addition to enjoying the above-mentioned benefits in terms of spring mulberry, the association will also provide farmers in the experimental guarantee with free elementary schools, one school per guarantee, thoroughly repair all the bad embankments, send mobile medical teams to diagnose diseases and provide health care, and repair bridges, pave roads, and provide relief to orphans, the elderly, and the poor.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Goes to the Countryside to Inspect and Lecture</p>
<p>After the principle was decided, Mr. Zhang Rongchu, Vice Chairman of the Association, took time out of his busy schedule to bring this abundant gift to Linghu and personally went to the countryside to visit and inspect. From May 4th to 8th, in the five days in between, braving the heavy rain, he walked through the muddy fields and went deep into every corner of the countryside. He visited the fourteen townships in the Linghu District. His companions included Wang Xi, Director of the Association Office, Wu Huaiqing, Director, Tan Yunlai, Ni Baiyan, representative of the Green Tree Foundation, Zhang Yuexian, Director of Silkworm Guidance, and more than a dozen other association staff. Mr. Zhang convened meetings of Bao chiefs and Jia chiefs in each township, distributed small booklets to silkworm farmers, and held meetings sometimes in temples, sometimes in township offices, and sometimes in squares. The number of people attending the meeting often reached two or three thousand, and almost every family sent someone to participate. The elderly came with canes, and babies hid in their mothers' arms, all to participate in this unprecedented grand meeting. Mr. Zhang used his earnest local dialect to give popular and practical lectures, and the farmers benefited a lot.</p>
<p>Silkworm Eggs Develop Well</p>
<p>According to the silkworm guide, the silkworm eggs issued by the association this time are developing very well. Among them, the results of the Sun and Moon brand have achieved 100% success. Judging from the current situation, as long as there are no accidents during the large silkworm period, the silkworm farmers in the entire district may increase their income by more than 10 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Under the spiritual inspiration of Mr. Zhang, the number of guarantees applying to the association for registration to join the experimental guarantee reached as many as 64, exceeding the predetermined number by more than twelve times. In order to avoid disappointing those who registered and affecting their enthusiasm, and in order to accelerate the completion of the silkworm reform work, Mr. Zhang wanted to accept all comers and list all these 60 or so guarantees as experimental guarantees. Although this method is good, in fact, even if the financial and human resources can be arranged, there are still many difficult problems in terms of material resources alone, especially the difficulty of baking cocoons on their behalf is even more difficult to overcome. Therefore, after repeated discussions, it was decided to adopt the principle of "one guarantee per township." The number of experimental guarantees in the first phase increased from five to eleven, and another twenty reserve guarantees were established. After the first experimental guarantee representative conference was held on the 11th of this month, various tasks began immediately.</p>
<p>The Experimental Plan Will Be Completed in Three Years</p>
<p>This is a brand-new experiment, and also an unprecedented creation. The future work will inevitably be very prosperous and arduous.</p>
<p>According to experts' estimates, this experimental guarantee plan may be completed within three years. After the completion of this plan, 17 silk reeling factories may be opened in the entire Linghu District, requiring more than 20,000 male and female workers, with an annual output of 15,000 to 20,000 bales of factory silk, which may be exchanged for more than 10 million US dollars in foreign exchange. In this way, not only can the goal of agricultural industrialization in the Linghu District be fully achieved, but also the contribution of this silk production to the entire national economy is immeasurable.</p>

<h3>Yellow River Dyke Repair Will Be a Miracle</h3>
<p>— Zhengzhou, 10th (Dispatch from Air) — Our Correspondent Fan Shidong</p>
<p>There are two major tasks that must be done after the blocking of the breach at Huayuankou on the Yellow River is completed: one is the reconstruction of the Yellow River flooded area, and the other is the restoration of the dikes downstream. This article discusses the downstream dike restoration, so the first point will not be addressed. Originally, the downstream dike restoration should have been coordinated with the breach blocking, but the breach blocking could not wait, so it was completed first. Fortunately, it is not the Yellow River's flood season, so the delay in dike restoration has not been a major issue; however, this can only be delayed once, and not again, otherwise, there will be a risk of a new Huayuankou and a new Yellow River flooded area when the flood season arrives.</p>
<p>The Yellow River is eight thousand li long in total. The upstream banks are surrounded by continuous mountains, which serve as natural river defenses. The downstream southern bank starts from the side of the Yellow River Iron Bridge, and the northern bank starts from Meng County. Except for a very small number of areas with mountains to rely on, the river depends on a 1,200-kilometer-long dike to contain the Yellow River water until it reaches the sea. From the fifth year of Xianfeng Emperor of the Qing Dynasty onwards, there have been over a hundred breaches, all within this downstream dike area. These facts, based on the history of the past ninety-two years, should not be false.</p>
<p>The river dikes near Jinan, spanning over a hundred kilometers, are already seventy to eighty percent completed. The southern dike from east of Heze to north of Jining, about one hundred kilometers, and the embankment south of the dike, about eighty-five kilometers, have been recovered by the National Army and can also be started for repair. The restoration of the other southern bank areas within Shandong province, which are under the control of the National Army, is even less of a problem. The Shandong Repair and Defense Office has decided to repair the three hundred-plus kilometers of the southern bank dike from May 5th to June 15th, and at the same time, correct the dike surface and slope protection. Then, from June 15th to July 15th, the dangerous sections will be completely reinforced. This project will mobilize one million laborers and complete two million cubic meters of earthwork.</p>
<p>Speaking of the northern bank, most of it is in the hands of the Communist Army. Over six hundred kilometers within Shandong province are within the Communist Army's sphere of influence. Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources Xue Dubi came to participate in the Huayuankou closure ceremony. When the reporter asked him about the dike repair situation by the Communist Army on the northern bank, he replied: Joint Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) consultants Todd and Van Meighem recently visited there once, and the Communist Army said that they mobilized 300,000 laborers and repaired the northern bank dike in three weeks.</p>
<p>If that is the case, this is truly a miracle: The government is repairing the southern dike, and the Communist Army is repairing the northern bank. Then the Yellow River will definitely behave itself and never dare to cause trouble again. If this miracle expands and grows, what can the country fear about weakness? What can the people fear about poverty?</p>
<p>If it is like what the Director of the Shandong Repair and Defense Office, Kong Lingrong, said: "Within the eighty kilometers from Juye to Dongping, it is still a chaotic area, and the Communist Army frequently appears, disrupting construction; even in some areas, because the river surface is only a hundred meters wide, the Communist Army's bullets often fly onto the heads of the laborers on the southern bank dike." Also, as the Director of the Henan Repair and Defense Office, Su Guanjun, and the Director of the Hebei Repair and Defense Office, Qi Shouan, said, the sixty to seventy kilometers of river dikes on the northern banks of those two provinces are having problems with even connecting pipes due to the war, not to mention repairs. Then, regarding the restoration of the river dikes, what miracle can we hope for, other than the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) deceiving the government for a sum of repair funds? (The government has allocated 4 billion to the CCP for dike repairs.) The matter cannot be viewed solely from a pessimistic perspective. The Communist Army may be doing something to repair the dikes on the northern bank, because this is also beneficial to the Communist Army. A miracle may appear in this gap. However, under today's military actions, the Communist Army, instead of restoring the dikes with the mindset of "benefiting me, benefiting the enemy," may have the mindset of "harming me, harming the enemy" and dig the dikes. This will produce another kind of miracle. Let's hold off on this conclusion and let the upcoming Yellow River flood season draw the conclusion!</p>

<h3>Authors of Qing Dynasty Humorous Prose Collections</h3>
<p>— Zizhen</p>
<p>During the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods of the Qing Dynasty, many humorous prose collections were produced, such as "Articles as Games," "What Absurdity," and "Everyone's Happy." A certain Mr. X's "Gua Dou Ji," published before the war, once introduced the article "As the Saying Goes." Regarding the author of "What Absurdity," he cited the fourth volume of "Everyone's Happy," "Yunhe Xuan Notes" (part 2), which said:</p>
<p>"Zhou Zhujun wrote 'A Debate between Man and Turtle'." And the second volume, "Yunhe Xuan Miscellaneous Works" (part 2), said:</p>
<p>" 'What Absurdity' was written by my friend, Mr. Zhou." Comparing these two quotes with the original book of "What Absurdity," he believed it was written by Zhou Zhujun. He said:</p>
<p>"It can be known that the author of this book is Zhou Zhujun. Although there is nothing else to investigate, most of this type of book has very humorous pseudonyms. Now that we can know his name, it is already rare." What he believed was "nothing to investigate" was just that he didn't investigate, not that there was nothing to investigate. As far as I know, regarding the author's deeds of "What Absurdity," in addition to the above, there is also a little more that can be investigated.</p>
<p>In "Ji Wo Can Gao" (sixteen volumes, preface by Kui Yu Daoren Wang Kun of Suzhou during the Tongzhi period. Dated Renchen Year of Tongzhi) written by Wang Kun of Suzhou during the Tongzhi period, the "Jiangnan Provincial Examination Model Essays" section of the first volume said:</p>
<p>"Zhou Zongtai of Suzhou compiled a novel using local dialects and colloquialisms, but the printing blocks have long been destroyed. I still remember his article 'Jiangnan Provincial Examination Model Essays,' and I feel that the events of that year are vividly before my eyes." Upon checking "Even More What Absurdity," there is an article "Jiangnan Provincial Examination Model Essays," which is what Wang Kun was referring to. Also, the "local dialects and colloquialisms" he mentioned refers to the "Colloquial Couplets" and other articles in the third volume of "Even More What Absurdity." From this, it can be known that the author of "Even More What Absurdity" is Mr. Zhou. According to the original book's preface:</p>
<p>"My son made mistake after mistake, wasting ink and repeatedly continuing and publishing, even more meaningless... I wasted ink and repeatedly continued this compilation... then continue your 'Even More What Absurdity'." This further proves that "What Absurdity" and "Even More What Absurdity" came from the same person, and the author is Zhou. Then, Zhou Zongtai is also Zhou Zhujun. However, Wang Kun only said Zhou Zongtai, and "Yunhe Xuan Notes" only said Zhou Zhujun. Although based on the titles of the cited articles and comparison with the original book, Zongtai and Zhujun must be the same person, the evidence is not solid. There must be other evidence to convince people.</p>
<p>In the twelve-volume "Qing Jia Lu," written by Gu Lu during the Daoguang period, describing the customs and traditions of Suzhou, he often quoted poems praising Wu customs and local conditions, most commonly the two types: Cai Yun's "One Hundred Exquisites of Wu Yu" and Zhou Zongtai's "Gusu Bamboo Branch Songs." The book quoted six "Gusu Bamboo Branch Songs":</p>
<p>"Ancestor Worship" (see volume 1, "Visiting Graves"), "Amitabha Rice" (see volume 4), "Jumping Stove God," "Jumping Zhong Kui," "Hanging Ingots," "New Year's Eve Dinner" (all see volume 12). According to the fourth volume of "What Absurdity," there are forty poems entitled "Gusu Four Seasons Bamboo Branch Songs." These six are among them, but the wording is slightly different. This further proves that "What Absurdity" was written by Zhou Zongtai. "Qing Jia Lu" clearly states Zhou Zongtai. Zongtai should be Zhou's given name, and Zhujun is his courtesy name or alias. Based on the dates recorded in the first and second collections of "What Absurdity" and "Even More What Absurdity" and his own narratives, Zhou's life can also be roughly known. The earliest date recorded in the book is the fourteenth or fifteenth year of Qianlong (1749-50). The "Jiang Xue Qi Chronicle" in the first collection said:</p>
<p>"In the second month of the year of Ji Si [1749], my father repaired its abandoned place... In the spring of the year of Geng Wu [1750], he discussed it with the stonemasons." It also said:</p>
<p>These are all memories of childhood. There are also the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches of the fifty-fourth year of Qianlong (1789, see "Exam"), the fifty-fifth year (1790, see "A Trip to the Upper Fang Mountain"), and the third year of Jiaqing (1798, see "Yin Yang Scholar"), but there is nothing that can be used to investigate his life. The latest is February of the fourth year of Jiaqing (1799) ("West Mountain Plum Blossom Viewing"), which is a few months before writing the preface.</p>
<p>Among them, only the "Exam" in the first collection involves his life. He said:</p>
<p>"In the second month of the year of Ji You, I went with my brother to take the children's exam."</p>
<p>Checking the year of Ji You, it is the fifty-fourth year of Qianlong (1789). This time taking the children's exam was probably an unsuccessful attempt. According to Qian Guoxiang's "Register of Scholars from the Three Counties" (nine volumes, published during the Guangxu period), in the fifty-sixth year of Qianlong, Xin Hai (1791), Supervising Instructor Hu ranked thirteenth in the county test of Wu County, and this was Zhou Zongtai. It can be known that he did indeed enter school. Also, judging from the tone of the two articles, "List of Successful Candidates in the Provincial Examination" in the first collection and "Jiangnan Provincial Examination Model Essays" in the second collection, he also took the provincial examination. However, checking Lu Maoxiu's "Register of Successful Candidates from Changyuan, Wu, and San Counties" (four volumes, published during the Guangxu period) and the lists of successful candidates in the Wu County Gazetteer by Mang Yunyuan, there is no name of Zhou, so he probably tried but was not successful, and died as a scholar. In the third volume of "Everyone's Happy," published in the first year of Daoguang, there is a record: "Mr. Zhou has passed away. His family, fearing that his verbal excesses would lead to punishment in the underworld, destroyed the printing blocks." Then Zhou's death must have been during the Jiaqing period. After his death, the printing blocks were also destroyed. His experiences can be said to be unfortunate! However, this kind of impoverished scholar, whose name is usually unknown outside his village, is instead passed down after his death through the "idle books" of humorous writing. This can also be said to be a great fortune within misfortune.</p>
<p>In the twenty-fourth year of Daoguang (1844), Zhejiang gentry Zhang Jian presented a request to destroy obscene books and published a "Record of Exhorting to Destroy Obscene Books," listing 120 book titles to be destroyed, including "What Absurdity" and "Even More What Absurdity." In the seventh year of Tongzhi (1868), Jiangsu Governor Ding Richang banned a list of obscene lyrics and novels (see "Jiangsu Provincial Regulations" of Tongzhi), with these two books also included in the first batch of 120. However, the books listed for destruction were mostly determined based on the book titles, regardless of the content. The inclusion of these two was probably due to the humorous and strange book titles. Judging from the content, although there are a few impure words in the first and second collections of this book, it is by no means in the same league as obscene novels. Moreover, there are a few articles that are quite literary in style. Treating humorous prose collections as novels is already unreasonable. Considering them obscene books is even more baffling!</p>
<p>In the second collection, there is a "Preface to the Continued Pipa Record," which says: "My friend Mr. Gao Boyang... showed me his 'Continued Pipa Record'." According to Yao Xie's "Textual Research on Contemporary Music," Gao Zongyuan's "Continued Pipa Record," "Newly Added Western Chamber," and "Revised Wang Zan" are recorded as three kinds of operas. It also says: "Zongyuan's courtesy name is Boyang, a native of Shanyin, also known as Qiu Lun Jushi." "Continued Pipa Record" is also seen in Liang Tingnan's "Teng Hua Qu Hua," volume 4, which says: "Wu Gu Ren (Xi Qi) wrote a preface for it." Only the Peking University Library possessed a copy of this legend before the war. No other copies were seen. It is also quite pleasing that the original preface is preserved in this book.</p>
<p>As for the "Bathhouse Record" praised in "Yunhe Xuan Miscellaneous Works," it can be found in the first volume of "What Absurdity." The article reads:</p>
<p>"A large stone is made into a pool, and a dome is made of bricks. A large cauldron is dug, connected to the pool. A winch draws water, and it is stored in a hole in the wall. Firewood is burned, and it soon becomes boiling water. Men who are unclean, those with oily skin, peddlers, butchers, those with sores, those with skin diseases, [and those with...] pay money to the owner and can all enter to bathe. From dawn to dusk, they come in droves, in countless numbers. If you kick it, you can scoop up mud and grime. The stench and filth are unbearable to be near. Scholars occasionally step into it as well. Do they not know it is dirty? Are they misled by its name? Are they accustomed to the custom and do not find it strange? Or are those who are unclean, those with oily skin, peddlers, butchers, those with sores, those with skin diseases, [and those with...] not harming each other? Or are their eyes unable to see, their noses unable to smell, and their hearts accustomed to confusion and do not know the smell? If the firewood is removed and the cauldron filled with the water from the ditches, how would it be different? Who would flock to it—flocking to its heat. Alas! What they call a 'bathhouse,' I see that it is only a mixture."</p>
<p>The article is indeed vivid and delightful, but it is not Zhou Zongtai's work, but rather a collection of writings from the Ming Dynasty. According to Lang Ying's "Seven Repairs and Classifications," volume 16, "Meaningful Categories," "Bathhouse":</p>
<p>"Bathhouses exist everywhere in the world, but Hangzhou's are the worst. Some well-meaning people have used it as a metaphor for a record, which quite captures the meaning of [moral instruction]. It is recorded to inform those who do not know shame. The record says:</p>
<p>"The custom of Wu: a large stone is made into a pool. A dome is made of bricks. Behind it is a giant cauldron, connected to the pool. A winch draws water and is stored in a hole in the wall. One person specializes in holding a [stirring instrument]. The pool water swallows each other, and it soon becomes boiling water. It is called a bathhouse, and the sign at the door says 'Fragrant Water.' Men who are unclean, those with oily skin, peddlers, butchers, those with sores, those with skin diseases, pay one coin to the owner, and they can all enter to bathe. From dawn to dusk, those who are naked and without clothes come in countless numbers. If you kick it, you can scoop up mud and grime. The stench of the body is unbearable. Scholars also bathe in it. Do they not know it is dirty? Are they misled by its name? Are they accustomed to the custom and do not find it strange? Or are those who are unclean, those with oily skin, peddlers, butchers, those with old sores, those with skin diseases, not harming each other? Or are the eyes of those who bathe in it unable to see, and their noses unable to smell? Alas! They flock to its heat. If the firewood is removed and the cauldron filled, how is it different from the water in the ditches? Who would flock to it?" (There are quite a few differences between the text and Zhou's article.)</p>
<p>Comparing the two, the traces of recording are obvious. There are not many places that have been changed. It can be known that the two collections of "What Absurdity" are not entirely the work of Zhou Min, but also include some old articles.</p>
<h3>Celebrating Fifty Years with Classmates at a Public Banquet - Third Month of Hai Year</h3>
<p>— Geng Danru</p>
<p>Only at fifty do I realize the errors of forty-nine, The affairs of a hundred years seem like a fleeting dream; Having lived in seclusion for so long, I feel leisurely, Idly gazing at the clouds, too lazy to strive. Year after year, I plant my tongue in the inkstone field, Green trees grow into shade, flowers fill the branches; Don't say that old farmers have no joy, Smiling, I watch the various plants compete in beauty. The taste of sugarcane is just beginning to be enjoyed, The vicissitudes of life are constantly changing; I only hope that the clouds and sky will show clear colors, Don't mention that the sun is already near the horizon. The good time with wine already makes faces light up, Moreover, old friends come in flocks; Tonight, let us all be intoxicated with joy, Wishing you longevity and passing the cup to each other.</p>
<h3>Madonna</h3>
<p>— Li Bi</p>
<p>Fra Filippo Lippi (1406-1469) was a great painter of 15th-century Italy. In his childhood, he was sent to the Carmelite monastery in Florence by his father because of poverty.</p>
<p>When Masaccio painted the frescoes of the Brancacci Chapel, he was working beside him doing sketches, and from then on he devoted himself to art and soon achieved great success. His style is very similar to Masaccio's and is generally called the soul of Masaccio. The cornerstone of Renaissance painting was also laid from this point on. Botticelli was one of his disciples, and Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were greatly influenced by him. (...)</p>
<h3>Spring Grass of Jiangnan</h3>
<p>— Shi Bi</p>
<p>Spring in Jiangnan comes early and leaves late; in this late spring, the spring grass is even greener. "White clouds rest on tranquil shores, fragrant grass closes idle doors," here, the spring grass is just like that, leisurely and freely embellishing the vibrant spring of Jiangnan, and decorating people's tranquil spring dreams.</p>
<p>However, "once the prosperity scatters like fragrant dust, the flowing water is heartless, and the grass naturally springs," the affairs of the world and the spring scenery ultimately have a distance; dreams are ultimately illusions, and our spurs to human relationships and worldly affairs ultimately cannot be escaped. This morning, pushing open the window to see the lush green countryside, the grass is already growing and submerging the path, which gave rise to a strange feeling in my heart; seeing the spring about to leave, although I am not to the extent of "fragrant heart turns to spring's end, all that's gained is tear-soaked clothes," the wisp of inexplicable lament that gradually rises from the bottom of my heart still cannot be suppressed.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have spent the spring in different places every year; my footsteps have been erratic, and I have been poor and destitute, and I have hardly felt peace for a moment. The spring grass, which puts on new clothes every year, has already been covered with a dismal gray-white color in what I have seen. When I was a child, my expectations for spring were joy and an emotional with a leaping forward spirit. However, the feeling that spring now gives me has changed from a lively and leaping mood to a heavy oppression!</p>
<p>Last spring, by the Jialing River, I saw the spring grass growing on the fertile coffee-red soil of Sichuan, the luster of the verdant covering that showed the fullness and richness of spring. At that time, it was early spring, and I was calculating to rush to Jiangnan to see the alluring spring scenery of Jiangnan; I was full of expectations that leaving Bashan would allow me to come to Jiangnan very quietly. However, on the long road to repatriation, I relived the wandering suffering of fleeing from the southwest to Sichuan in the spring of 1945. Just as I arrived in Jiangnan in a dreamlike daze, the hardships of reality and the many more difficulties added to my life had already made me lose the leisure to appreciate the spring grass of Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Indeed, the spring grass of Jiangnan is originally particularly slender and soft, set against the azure and clear sky; the gentle breeze slowly comes, stirring up green waves with the wind, lightly and gracefully, containing endless elegance. However, it is a pity that they grow on such a difficult land; in the past, in the cruel war and the enemy's washing and robbing, I don't know how many times they have been stained with the bloody killings of the people; and now, even in the regions of rice and fish, there is desolation and famine everywhere, although the spring grass comes new and green every year, lush as ever, these spring grasses have long been abandoned by the people!</p>
<p>History is playing out in tragedy: famine, terror, and death are expanding. The goddess of spring is about to gather her tired wings, and in the lonely wilderness, the spring grass must be sobbing there, right?</p>
<p>I thought of Bai Juyi's famous line: "Luxuriant grass on the original, withered and flourishing every year, wildfire cannot burn it out, the spring breeze blows and it grows again." This explains the vitality of life that still exists in a chaotic world. There are many hardships in life, and what we seek is this tiny bit of stubbornness!</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>— Yu Heng</p>
<p>Music is the art of painting sounds; it is an art of time. They both contain sufficient emotional effects and can give the appreciator more aesthetic pleasure.</p>
<h3>Ozymandias of Egypt</h3>
<p>— By Percy Bysshe Shelley, Translated by Zhen Qin</p>
<p>I met a traveller from an antique land, Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand, Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, Tell that its sculptor well those passions read Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; And on the pedestal, these words appear: My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</p>
<p>(This sonnet is one of Shelley's masterpieces, first published in 1818. Ozymandias is said to have been the first warlike monarch of Egypt around 2100 BC, who invaded Asia. Fowler points out that the words carved on the pedestal in the poem are Egyptian hieroglyphs, the meaning of which was not understood by people in Shelley's time, and it was not until 1822 that Champollion discovered the mysteries of this writing. – Translator)</p>
<h3>A Record of the Cloud Retreat Studio</h3>
<p>— Sun Fuxi</p>
<p>The name of Wang Yachen is known to women and children, and Wang Yachen's paintings are recognized by women and children. Why is Mr. Wang's painting so famous? Why is it so popular? This is the reason I want to introduce.</p>
<p>His paintings are the most popular among contemporary writers. All the subjects, all the methods, and all the forms and spirits are just right for the temperament and needs of the vast majority of Chinese people, and even the Japanese and Indians in the East, and the British and French and Americans in the West, are also fond of them at first sight. Although this result is not a very high achievement in art, it is a very valuable achievement. Especially in China today, when education is not widespread and politics is trying to focus on the masses, the popularization of art is even more valuable.</p>
<p>Speaking of the origin of this popularized art, I have to talk about the "Cloud Retreat Tower" where he lives.</p>
<p>The Cloud Retreat Studio is a lane house in the French Concession. Although the location is quite quiet, it is still a lane. There is a tall palm tree at the entrance, but the courtyard is too small to have any other flowers and plants. The interior walls are mostly bookshelves, and otherwise filled with ancient and modern calligraphy. Yachen studied in Japan, and also traveled with his wife to France and Italy. He loves ancient calligraphy and paintings, and also studies new methods. He values both the old and new and has no prejudice. He treats friends of all ages, high and low, from all walks of life, equally, without favoritism or attacking differences. This is the reason why he has become universal and popularized, and it is also the merit of his wife's assistance. Therefore, people in the literary and art circles regard the Cloud Retreat Studio as a meeting center.</p>
<p>There is a large painting table by the window. The paper, pens, inkstone, water pot, and pigments on the table are all neatly prepared. The water in the water pot is always clear, and a good inkstone produces a lot of ink after three turns. The pigment cups are never dry, and they are watered at any time, like watering flowers. He paints at the table every day. Anyone who can paint is persuaded to spread out the paper and wield the brush. Therefore, he is influenced by many people, and he also influences many others. Therefore, he paints everything, from flowers, birds, grass, and insects to landscapes and even figures of beautiful women. There is a bronze sculpture of a carp on the stove rack, and behind the table is a four-sided glass fish cage with goldfish, so he has more experience in painting fish. Other potted flowers and caged birds are also sometimes used as objects for sketching. Contemporary painters have all been to this Cloud Retreat Studio, and they have all wielded their brushes at the Cloud Retreat Studio, feeling inspired after drinking. This is a location worth commemorating - there is also one more thing: it was at the Cloud Retreat Studio that he purchased and collected about 200 valuable works by modern writers such as Baishi, Beihong, and Daqian.</p>
<p>In the Yachen Exhibition, after you have enjoyed it, read this article again. If you have not been to the Cloud Retreat Studio, it is even better to visit it. This record can greatly increase your appreciation.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 514</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>That eccentric Miss, although she didn't understand Japanese, saw Tsurumi's somewhat distraught look after receiving the phone call, knew the content of the call wasn't good. She stopped asking him, "Are you Chinese or Japanese after all?" and raised another question:</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Gu, my brother said you are a hero who risks triple danger to serve the country, but I'm a little curious, how exactly do you exist in these triple dangers? I mean, what methods do you use to get people to let you operate?"</p>
<p>"Oh," Tsurumi's mind was in a mess from the news from the phone call, unable to grasp a single thread to sort it out. If the person who came was Li Ming, Shouyi, Zhengyan, or that Korean young patriot, he would be a suitable object to discuss these bad news with, perhaps he wouldn't be so helpless, but instead came this devil-like Miss, and she kept asking such strange questions one after another, impossible to answer clearly in a moment. Moreover, so far, Tsurumi still didn't know her surname or given name, whether her brother was indeed Shouyi of the Hundredfold Patience Manor, so even if he wanted to answer, he couldn't help but be a little wary.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid you don't understand my two questions?" This Miss was clearly a little unhappy, "But there's one more question, you must enlighten me, otherwise, I would have come for nothing...!"</p>
<p>"Miss," Tsurumi furrowed his brow, "I am willing to answer any questions you have, only I regret that you came at a bad time, and I happen to be encountering serious difficulties. Now I have received the most unfavorable news, and my mind is very confused. And the two questions you raised can't be explained clearly in a few words. Miss, if you are the younger sister of Brother Shouyi, he will surely be able to answer for me in the future, and it will be more powerful than my own answer..."</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter"; this "matter" must be part of this Miss's speech. "What I want to ask now, I'm afraid only you, sir, can answer—I want to ask you to describe—that Japanese Miss who came with you, what's her name, Pingzi, right? I want to know what she looks like, does she have any special marks on her face... Freckles? Scars? Ringworm around her eyes? Crooked mouth? Sunken nasal bridge?... For example, special marks that you can recognize and distinguish at first glance?"</p>
<p>"Oh: This... I can't explain it clearly either... Probably she looks very pretty, is a... oval face, phoenix eyes... cherry lips, right?... There's a small dimple on her left cheek when she smiles, right?... Straight nose, somewhat like a Westerner, but not so high and prominent..."</p>
<p>Tsurumi used almost all the Pekingese words he had learned over the years to describe facial features, and was running out of steam; he wanted to explain it more clearly, more definitively, but his vocabulary was insufficient, and he really couldn't describe what Pingzi looked like. He thought for a while, then suddenly remembered a characteristic: "When she starts speaking, she has a bit of a smile first; once touched, she will immediately be sad and tearful..."</p>
<p>This eccentric Miss came so abruptly and left so hastily. She listened to Tsurumi's last sentence, and didn't pursue it any further, suddenly got up from her seat, nodded slightly; before the words "Goodbye" were finished, she had already opened the door and left, and closed the door behind her.</p>
<p>Tsurumi just wanted to rush out the door to see her off, to play the gentleman to the end, but unfortunately another phone call came just then.</p>
<h3>Casual Talks While Alone</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>I have always loved the poems of the English Robert Burns. The year before last in Chongqing, I read a translated collection of poems by Mr. Yuan Shuipai, "My Heart is in the Highlands," in which more than half were Burns's small poems. The translation was excellent, especially the foreword.</p>
<p>He began by mentioning Chaplin. He said:</p>
<p>Chaplin especially likes to depict a tramp and a policeman who is two or three times bigger than him, and who has to bend over to talk to him. This small tramp, although he has been struggling in a world full of coldness and hostility for decades, still has not lost his innocent childlike heart. In one film, Chaplin wanted to reconcile with a man who hated him. He went up full of good intentions, wanting to strike up a conversation with this stern man, with a bouquet of flowers in his right hand, hidden behind his back, smiling and about to give it to the man, but immediately a big fist came over, and Chaplin fell to the ground, the bouquet of flowers not even seen, was crushed on the ground.</p>
<p>In this philistine Shanghai, there are many of this same type of deliberate act. If you have flowers to give, never hide them behind your back. This "progressive" society is like a marketplace, like a stock exchange, and there is no "human touch" or even "humor" to speak of. If you have no flowers to give, you might as well pretend to be giving flowers. Because in this day and age, the respect between people is mostly "deception".</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Premature Maturity of Children</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhou</p>
<p>Besides the eye-catching news of human-demon cases, incest cases, and sodomy cases, there may naturally be such news:</p>
<p>"(×× News) The son of a resident of this city, Chen, 14 years old, took 120,000 yuan with him a month ago, and left home with several classmates to seek immortality. Fortunately, his father found out earlier and retrieved him. Unexpectedly, he ran away again yesterday, leaving a letter saying: 'Dissatisfied with the real world, so I leave home to become a disciple and seek immortality'..."</p>
<p>In a strange and changing society, children are also maturing early. A thirteen-year-old girl is already qualified to be raped, then a fourteen-year-old boy, unable to save the world and barely able to save himself, after seeing too many things like "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple", will naturally have strange ideas about leaving home to seek immortality. Before and after the war, we have seen a lot of news about children seeking immortality, which is not surprising, but this time, "Chen's son" is explicitly leaving because he is "dissatisfied with reality", so it can't help but make people a little surprised.</p>
<p>There are many people who are dissatisfied with reality, some are silent, some pretend to be crazy, some say "Live for today, drink for today", some say "If I don't go to hell, who will?", and some think that the theater is a small world, the world is a big theater, put on a mask, why not run rampant? I rarely see an adult who is so serious about abandoning his family and running away, saying that he wants to seek immortality, to save the world. With more experience in the world, the idea of "seeking immortality" inevitably seems too naive, but at the same time, it also loses that bit of childlike heart. Being dissatisfied with reality is one thing, drifting with the tide of the world in reality is another. Mr. Lu Xun said: "The results of experience, whether good or bad, require a great sacrifice. Even small things inevitably cost a lot." (Collection of Southern and Northern Tones) Yes, the more experience humans have, the more courage they often lose. Those who are old but still brave in combat are rare among people, so these brave people are often the elite and flowers of humanity.</p>
<p>At present, what we see and hear is rarely good news. Children are usually "uncompetitive with the world", and should mostly enjoy their childhood life without worry, but that is not the case. Wasn't Shanghai Pushan Cemetery burying hundreds of children's corpses around Children's Day? Wasn't there a play of "Splitting Open the Coffin" performed there? Wasn't a large number of child bandits discovered around Guangzhou, traveling back and forth on sailboats to rob? Isn't the large number of child thieves in Hangzhou already a special feature in various newspapers? In addition, such as thirteen-year-old girls being raped, fifteen-year-old students running away to "save the nation", etc., all illustrate the abnormality of this society. Recently, the Fourth Division of the Shanghai District Court tried the sixteen-year-old thief Xu Guoliang, and the judge was embarrassed by the thief, which is even more legendary. The matter is like this: after Judge Wu finished questioning, he intended to sentence him to 30 days of detention, but after the child heard the sentence, he asked the judge with a surprised expression: "Sir, I have already been detained for forty days." If calculated correctly, the court owes him ten days of detention.</p>
<p>In this chaotic world, children are mostly precocious, so since there are one or two child prodigies in society, there are also more child bandits and child prostitutes, and the contrast between the two also reflects a corner of reality.</p>
<h3>Thinking of People When Seeing Things</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Girl A: I was thinking about you all day yesterday.</p>
<p>Boy B: Really? How interesting! Where were you yesterday?</p>
<p>Girl A: At the zoo.</p>
<h3>Love for the Homeland</h3>
<p>— Keren</p>
<p>Since the Yellow River restoration project, which has been under construction for more than a year, was completed at Huayuankou in March, the Henan refugees who have been displaced in the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Hubei for nine years have been returning to their hometowns in droves; according to statistics from relevant authorities, the total number of people entering the flooded area every day is more than 2,000. Among these people, the majority are old men and women; there are disabled people who support themselves with bamboo poles and walk two or three months on foot; there are those who fled with their whole family, young and old, and now return alone as survivors of the disaster; and there are tenacious mothers who carry baskets in one hand and fatherless orphans in the other. These people's teams are advancing slowly, bearing the grievances and pains suffered during their long exile, enduring the wind and rain and hunger of the journey, with the pious state of mind of Muslims making a pilgrimage to Mecca, step by step towards their hometown.</p>
<p>Nine years! Nine years is not a short time, and the turbulence of the past nine years is truly astonishing! The town shops that were once densely packed are now flat and empty; the ox carts that were used day and night, the tile houses and thatched sheds that several generations lived in, and the persimmon forests that were painstakingly planted, have all disappeared into the boundless sand. Where is the hometown after all? However, the soil of the hometown is dear, and thousands upon thousands of returnees have already found the old site of their own fields and houses, where they have re-compacted the foundations and built thatched sheds; they have sown the seeds of grain and planted yesterday's, and also tomorrow's, hopes together.</p>
<p>In the summer of the 1943, I secretly crossed the Yellow River south of Kaifeng and entered Shaanxi by an indirect route. On the way, I crossed a thirty-mile flooded area of the Yellow River. Looking around, reeds and artemisia grew densely, more than ten feet high and boundless. The strong wind swept through, like ghosts crying, like gods howling. The road was opened by weaving through reeds and artemisia, thorns pricked the knees, and sand and gravel submerged the ankles; and the tops of the village trees, houses, and arches of the past, only their peaks, ridges, and the words "chastity arch" emerged from the ground. Looking down at the yellow sand and weeds, I really don't know how many lives and properties are buried in it. However, after nine years of vicissitudes, the children born from this land have returned today.</p>
<p>Besides sincere blessings, what else can I say?</p>
<h3>How to Teach Your Children - Tell You a Few Good Examples</h3>
<p>— Translated by Meng Lin</p>
<p>(1) The Red Vase</p>
<p>A pair of brothers, Jeon and Edward, often and fiercely argued, each insisting that the other was completely wrong. One day, their heated argument was accidentally overheard by their father, who called them into his study and made them sit face to face at the table. He took down a red glass vase from the mantelpiece, one side of which had a white rose decoration. He placed the vase in the center of the table, then said to Jeon, "Tell me what you see?"</p>
<p>"I see a red vase," Jeon replied.</p>
<p>"Jeon, tell me what you see?" He turned to Edward.</p>
<p>"I see a red vase with a white rose on it," Ai replied.</p>
<p>"Very good, children, that's right!" the father said.</p>
<p>The children understood their father's meaning. In the future, whenever they disagreed with others to the point of almost turning into a fruitless argument, they remembered the red vase's teaching, and realized that it was just a difference in perspective.</p>
<p>(2) The Open Palm</p>
<p>When I was ten years old, I found my first true "companion" among the girls at school. The friendship between the two of us became my most important thing. Because of possessiveness, whenever she had fun without me, I felt very jealous of her. I didn't hide this attitude from her, and the result was of course that she disliked me.</p>
<p>Mom understood everything that was happening. One day, we were admiring some chicks, and I picked one up and held it tightly, almost suffocating it. It struggled to escape! And immediately escaped. Mom casually said, "If you hold a chick too tightly, it will only want to escape. Try holding it more loosely."</p>
<p>The second chick indeed quietly squatted on my open palm. Mom said kindly, "You have to understand, honey, humans are like chicks. If we control the people we love too closely, they will fight for their freedom. Open our palms to protect them, and they won't feel suffocated."</p>
<p>This lesson was beneficial. Although I still felt jealous sometimes, as long as I imagined the scene of a chick contentedly squatting on my palm, I wouldn't show it on my face.</p>
<h3>General Discussion on Music Culture</h3>
<p>— Sheng He</p>
<p>Musical art is a part of culture, and in terms of its effectiveness in cultivating the spirit and beautifying life, it is a rather important department of culture. My country's music is backward. Although there has been some progress in the past 20 years, if we compare it with the music of various countries in the world, the gap is far away, and the greatest efforts are still needed.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the backwardness, such as the lack of talents, the decline of music education, the neglect of psychology, the dependence on imported musical instruments... The author believes that the biggest reason is that music culture has not been promoted and carried forward. Music culture is of great importance to the progress of music art and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Music culture includes at least the following three main items:</p>
<p>(1) Musical Creation</p>
<p>(2) Musical Criticism</p>
<p>(3) Music Publishing Industry</p>
<p>The above three items are extremely important departments of music culture, and should be developed evenly and carried out in a complementary manner in order to achieve great results. Today, China's musical talents are increasing day by day, and among them, the number of composers is not very scarce. Although there are creations, there are not many. How to encourage the vigorous creation of Chinese musical works (including vocal and instrumental) and widely recommend and introduce them is the primary urgent task for developing Chinese music culture. Secondly, establishing music criticism is also essential. We often see film reviews and drama reviews in newspapers and magazines, but rarely see music reviews (excuse me for coining this term); even if there are one or two articles criticizing music concerts, they are not criticisms at all, but just some feelings. Music critics do not necessarily have to be musicians, but at least they must have considerable cultivation in terms of appreciation ability, musical knowledge, and understanding of music in order to be competent and happy. Speaking of China's music publishing industry, it is even more pitiful! As far as I know, at present, the publication of books on music theory and sheet music is almost non-existent; and the number of high-quality periodic music publications in the country is no more than ten, but they all die young or are delayed due to funding, printing, and various difficulties.</p>
<p>If we want to develop Chinese music culture, we must work hard towards the above three goals. Relying solely on the strength of the music industry and people who care about and love music is not enough. It really depends on the government authorities to enthusiastically subsidize and advocate it with a long-term vision and determination.</p>
<h3>Listening to Music</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Yesterday, by the radio, I listened to Yu Pai's old-man actor Chen Dahuo singing three segments of "Great Bao Guo", which was very interesting. According to the second half of this play is the "Second Entry to the Palace". Famous artists such as Tan Yu and others only performed the "Entry to the Palace" but not the "Protect the Country", so the reason for this is not that they were unable to read and sing, but that in addition to the character Li Liang, the writing of this play is not very different from the "Second Entry to the Palace". In addition, the old version of the lyrics are vulgar, far from the identity of the characters in the play, and the actors were not good at writing, so they did not dare to change and delete them without authorization, so they gave up performing it. Later, Yan Jupeng came to Shanghai and performed this play, starting from "Great Bao Guo" and ending with "Second Entry to the Palace", with a "Sighing at the Imperial Mausoleum" inserted in the middle; his intention was nothing more than to turn a small play into a big play and add more appeal. Unexpectedly, this play became popular as soon as it was performed, and famous actors such as Tan Gongying, Yang Shisen, and Li Zongyi then sang it together, but all performed according to the old version. Although the singing sentences of famous artists had differences, they were roughly the same. Yesterday, listening to Dahuo sing this was very different from the other actors. Not only were the words elegant and smooth, but they could also express the identity and tone of the minister. The tunes were also novel and unique, without a single sentence being the same. Each singing tune could fully express the emotions of the lyrics. It is difficult to achieve this without hard work.</p>
<p>New Knowledge</p>
<h3>The Mystery of Grass</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>It is reported that an antelope man was found in North Africa, who can run fifty miles per hour, which will make the long-distance runners in the World Games pale in comparison. It is also said that his main food is grass, which is a credible reason.</p>
<p>Scientists discovered a few years ago that one pound of dry grass contains 23 times more "vitamin A" than carrots, 9 times more "vitamin B1" than vegetables, 22 times more "vitamin B2" than lettuce, and 14 times more "vitamin C" than tomatoes. In addition, alfalfa powder contains sufficient hemostatic "vitamin K" and protein, but ordinary people have to look for "vitamin K" in liver and vegetables. Because "vitamin K" can prevent retinal hemorrhage and blindness, and can also remedy menstrual disorders and stomach ulcers in women.</p>
<p>At the American Chemical Society annual meeting, a famous scientist declared that if people use powder made from barley and oat leaves, they will not suffer from colds in winter after eating it. He also suggested that each person only needs twelve pounds of grass powder per year to get enough nutrients. Now there are factories in the United States that specialize in making grass powder for home use.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this antelope man has such a running speed because he gets nutrition from grass. In fact, before the 5th century AD, the Babylonian king Cainisha had no military food for three months after breaking through Jerusalem and lived entirely on grass. However, now that mankind has progressed, they have forgotten that grass in nature also contains such valuable nutrients.</p>
<h3>Art and Literary Scene</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Experimental Theater Troupe will perform "Chang'e," a new mythological drama in three acts, six scenes, and seven acts by Wu Zuguang, directed by Yuan Jun. They have been rehearsing day and night and are already prepared to be staged at the Lyceum Theatre on the night of the 20th. The play is a new type of dance stage play with a unique style. It is reported that the ticket prices are only 3,000, 5,000, 7,000, and 10,000.</p>
<p>The "Culture Pioneer Bi-Monthly," Volume 6, Issue 23, a purely academic magazine published by the Culture Pioneer Society of Nanjing Xiangpu Camp, has been published. The content is very exciting.</p>
<h3>Su Dongpo is Afraid of Back Rubbing</h3>
<p>— Ning Yuan</p>
<p>Su Dongpo was tricked! The lay Buddhist originally had nothing, probably not when he was young and at Huangzhou, "There is dirt!" The implication is probably countless! Although someone has written a back-rubbing song. Not only is it profound, wanting to rub their backs, the song says: "Dirt on the skin, but they are always used to it and do not accept it at all? Su Lao's borrowing the topic to make a point lightly, probably has another perspective, accustomed to it, I see that the dirt on the back and the person are both insignificant. It has a lot of meaning." Compared to the cowardly Su Dongpo, trying to clean us Try looking at today's wielder of back-rubbing people, to the extreme the elbow, soft hand! Indeed, one must be stronger than them. There are those who hide dirt for the whole day!</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Precarious City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Mrs. Zhou, come down and talk! Come down and talk!" That skinny driver also gradually felt the seriousness of the matter, so he went up to persuade the fat woman himself; but he still wanted to retain some dignity for himself, so his tone wasn't too soft.</p>
<p>These two sentences were like pouring a big bucket of gasoline onto a fire. The fat woman lightning-like pulled out a pair of shiny scissors from who knows which clothing bag.</p>
<p>"You're planning to bully a woman, aren't you?" She blocked the entire car door with her half-short, thick body, tightly gripping the scissors in her right hand and grabbing the back of the seat with her left hand, glaring at all the people standing on the ground with angry eyes. "No way! No way! I'm not getting off the bus!" She gave the driver a special stare. "Do you still have a conscience? My three taels of gold didn't fall from the sky! Whoever wants me to get off the bus, I'll fight them to the death!"</p>
<p>She shouted like she was slaughtering a pig, almost alarming everyone in this open space.</p>
<p>"Wonderful! Wonderful!" Zhang Chang, with the mentality of watching a fire from the other side of the river, couldn't help but cheer, and even taught the hooligan to imitate him, clapping his hands continuously.</p>
<p>Director Xiong, who was in a dilemma, glared at him fiercely, but he pretended not to see it.</p>
<p>"Deng Guozhong, damn it! What are you still standing there for?" Now, Company Commander Liu also felt that this matter was getting out of hand, and slapped the driver on the face with one hand. "Why don't you hurry over there? Discuss it with Wang Shixiong and the others, whichever one of your drivers agrees! Give her a seat, we have to leave at nine o'clock!"</p>
<p>Zheng Guozhong, with a mournful face, scurried out of the crowd like a dog.</p>
<p>The young Director Xiong still had to pretend to be calm and try his best to perfunctorily deal with the middle-aged man holding the walking stick; he felt that he had really lost face today because of this damned driver.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Company Commander Liu's painstaking efforts still couldn't gain the understanding of the short, fat Hunan woman. She stomped on the driver's seat with her two big feet wearing square-toed black leather shoes, and shouted all the way:</p>
<p>"No way! No way! I must sit on this car! My luggage is all on this car, you want to get rid of me! Don't dream! I..."</p>
<p>The onlookers immediately burst into laughter.</p>
