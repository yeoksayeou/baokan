<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕左舜生今晨視事後，農部仝人下午舉行茶會，表示歡迎。記者訪問左氏詢以對農林部今後施政方針時，左氏堅不願發表任何意見，並謂「若余仍爲一個寫文章的人，可以隨便提出意見發表施政方針，但現在我爲一執行者，就不能說空話，一經開出之支票，定必使其實現。茶會中左氏致詞謂「今後農林部一切事情均可公開，農林部並不是什麼軍事秘密，絕無不可對人言者，惟有公開才能進步。又內定中之新任農林部政常兩次長謝澄平，周皇雲，尚待政務會議通過。（下左氏簽字）</p>
<h3>陳啟天任經長說　左舜生稱未確定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕國務會議定十八日晨十時舉行臨時會議，聞靑年黨陳啓天繼李璜任經濟部長，常乃惪遞補府委及出任官吏之參政員遞補人選，均將在臨時會議中決定。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕頃據左舜生氏諨記者，李璜已決定不就經濟　長之職，外傳將由靑年黨推陳啓天轉任一節，亦未確定經濟·文化各種建設之實施方案，並將各項已定之計劃，配合實地視察結果，分先後緩急，逐步進行。張氏年來所執行之和平政策，顯將與今後各項積極建設工作獲得相輔相成之效也。</p>
<h3>四行兩局一庫　梅恕曾提出合併建議　立院經法兩委會作初步審查</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕立法院經濟，法制委會，十六日晨開會，初步審查梅恕曾等立委所提，建議合併國家四行·兩局，一庫爲中央銀行及國家業務銀行兩機構，以省物力，財力，加强信用，發展業務案，今日會議由李委員慶　召集，各行局代表列席者，有冀朝鼎，崔唯吾，朱通九，壽勉成，羅吟圃等，會中各行局代表各述理由，咸盼此案能先從長計議，再作決定，會議至午始散。按梅委員原提案共提出下列四大理由：（一）業務衝突，各行局業務，除央行外，大多數性質難以劃分，往往互相衝突，不僅重覆，且復相互競爭。（二）浪費人財物力，四行兩局一庫機構，遍設全國，不僅同一都市各立門戶，且在同一街道，亦有對立之機構，按調查所得，國行共有一〇七個單位，職員四四五〇人，中行國內共有一七一個單位，國外共有十五個單位，職員三三六五人，交通國內共有一七三個單位，國外五個單位，職員二九一一人，中農共有二五五個單位，職員四六二一人，中信局共有三十七個單位，職員一六七五人，其他郵滙局，合作金庫不詳，其組織之麻大，人員之衆多，可以想見，其浪費國家人財物力，亦可想而知。（三）造成割據現象，各行局庫同爲國家金融機稱，然因其歷史淵源之不同，人事關係之互異，於是各自爲政，門戶森嚴，無形中造成金融界一種割據形勢，以致對於國家金融政策之推行決難實行整齊與統一之步調。（四）養成特殊階級，各行局庫人員，本同爲公務人員，但因一切開支皆不需抑賴國庫之故，不僅辦公費用可任意開支，職員待遇亦可不照政府規定，享受特殊之薪金補貼，而造成公務員中之特殊階級，由於上述四種理由，不僅在系統上有調整必要，即為節省公帑，說應予以合併。據估計，合併成兩個機構後，至少可裁去四百餘個單位，八千餘職員，每一單位每年辦公費若以二億元計算，年可省費八百億元，職員薪金每人每年以二千萬計，亦可省千六百億元，至歸併後之兩個機構，國行之業務爲發行，調劑金融，經理國庫執行「銀行之銀行」之使命，國家業務銀行之業務，爲工礦，農貸，貿易，林漁，航運，匯兌，外滙，僑滙，儲蓄，信託，合作，貼現等。</p>

<h3>英議員籲請政府　應注視遠東現局　艾關切我國目前局勢</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦十六日電〕在今日下院外交辯論中，保守黨議員弗萊特契，指責美國在日本圍上一「橡皮幕幛」。渠稱：「我人可以掀起橡皮幕幛之一角，然在撤手時，幕又立即掩下。</p>
<p>其他保守黨與工黨之議員亦聯同弗萊特契，呼籲英國政府更注意日本。弗氏稱，政府應使美國相信英國實爲美國在遠東良好之夥伴，且英國「在傳統上有權參加」。</p>
<p>「日本雖為橡皮幕所籠罩，然終較鐵幕之易於撒開。」</p>
<p>弗萊特契又稱，政府必須放棄其對華坐視政策：「我人必須盡力鼓勵各商業與貿易機關，並與美國及其他國家携手進行貿易。</p>
<p>工黨議員巴當稱「政府對遠東甚少興趣，實應重視，若爲畏久計，以後遠東所發生之問題，實遠較歐洲者重要多多」。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫教十五日電〕前外相艾登在下議院之外交辯論中，曾提及中國問題，表示誠摯希望中國內部局勢得以改進，中英間悠久之友好關係得以繼續增强。艾登復促請英政府速與中國締結貿易條約，不應落於美國之後。艾登並述及英人在華之財產，指出雖經中國高級當局之允許發還，但迄猶在華方扣留中。許多英僑，尤其是前上海工部局之英籍僱員，均因此陷入艱苦之處境，希望政府採取步驟，使各項合法要求　得在合理期間內解決。</p>

<h3>預防選舉舞弊　應速制定法規　簡貫三談取締賄賂選舉</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕立委簡貫三今日談取締選舉舞弊，謂應限制候選人以金錢，物品，酬酢，武力以及公私位置，作爲活動選舉手段或酬報條件，無論由候選人自行出面，或通過第三者間接運用，均應認爲違法；接受或請求此類條件之選舉人或代辦人，亦應認爲違法。簡氏在十五日立院例會中，曾提議制定「選舉舞弊取締法」，渠認爲此項法規之內容應將刑法中與選舉有關條文與其他有關選舉舞弊事項聯繫一起，制成單行法。簡氏稱，防止舞弊，除以法律限制外，希望報界發揮社會制栽力量，以收呼應之效。渠並對記者追述其提議之原因：第一，在民主先進國家選舉舞弊亦所難免，故英國在1880年有「國會議員選舉及舞弊治罪法」，在1883年有「防止舞弊及非法選舉治罪法」，法國在1902年有「選舉舞弊取締法」。第二，我國在初步邁入民主階段，選舉舞弊恐將更多，尤應制定法規，以資事前預防，事後制裁，况五十年來，中等階級以下人民，經濟地位日趨沒落，若不禁止以金錢或威力精選，恐選舉結果，盡爲有財有力者所包辦矣。</p>

<p>〔本報滋陽十五日電〕記者今謁王敬久司令官，據稱：國軍刻從事一新布置，魯省局勢短期內將有重大轉變。</p>
<p>〔本報濟南十五日電〕魯國軍現着重肅淸魯南，魯中山區之共軍·故對·川·博山之總攻擊尙未發動。迄十五日，博山以南仍相持於靑石關外之和莊一帶，惟淄博經過大破壞，礦區毀滅，城郊亦半成焦土，地方損失極大，蒙陰，泗水附近共軍九六兩縱隊，莒縣，沂水一帶共軍二七兩縱隊，力避作戰，到處流竄，但國軍已究成包圍圈，逐步縮小，隨時搜尋其主力而消滅之。三日來殲滅共軍達二萬人，莒，沂之收復，已屬時間問題。濟南外圍形勢已和緩，十五日戰况無變化，桑梓店附近相持於八里莊，齊河亦在城西對峙。</p>

<h3>台省主席魏道明視事　宣佈四項新措施　全省解嚴結束淸鄕工作</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北十六日電〕台省行政長官公署今日撤消正式改爲台灣省政府。今晨九時首任主席魏道明，前往省府視事，前公署秘書長葛敬恩，代表陳儀長官辦理移交，並未舉行任何儀式。魏氏爲力謀台省社會安定，首先宣佈：（一）解除全省施行已歷兩月零六天之戒嚴令。（二）結束全省各地現尙進行中之淸鄕工作。（三）廢除新聞圖書及郵電檢查。（四）撤消交通及通訊機構之軍事管制。上述四事，均自今日起實行，聞係與台省警備司令彭孟緝會商決定者。魏氏同時並宣佈台幣與法幣之比率，自今日起，由一比四十改爲一比四十四，以謀台省經濟之穩定。據悉：魏氏在京時，即與中央商定改變匪率，今始正式宣佈。魏氏嗣於十時召開首次省府會議，會中通過撤消下列五機構，即法制委會，台省設計考核委會，台省公營事業管理委會，台省編譯館及新聞室，其他可能改制之原有機構，在未決定前，均暫予保留。對於公務人員遣散一事，陳儀氏離台前，即已頒定辦法，每人發給遣散費及旅費，共計四個月薪津。陳儀行前、先批准之遣散人員，以及今後因編制變更而被編餘之人員，均依此項規定辦理。據負責方面稱，截至目前止，已隨魏氏來台之新任人員，包括委員廳長在內，尙不足五十人，故於原有機構撤消者外，極盼原有人員繼續服務。又民政廳長丘念台，現仍堅辭，各方猶在設法挽留，丘氏刻在滬檢查身體，其職務暫由委員朱佛定代理。</p>
<h3>特種庫券即發行　張嘉璈連日召專家研討　票面將自十萬至五百萬</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕特種短期庫劵發行在即，中央銀行張總栽爲求發行技術妥善，連日在京召專家研討，聞當局爲使一般人民咸能普遍購買，該劵票額將自十萬元起，其上則分五十萬，百萬，五百萬等，並將分記名與無記名兩種，任購者自擇。（抗戰期間所發行之美金公債，即有記名無記名兩種）。且爲便利購買手續，可能採用在券面塡寫購買日期方法，俾無論何日，皆可往購。各方對政府此項擬議，一般反響咸佳，唯一考慮爲恐其影響美金券債之勸銷。惟據某金融專家談，特種短期庫券利息雖較美金債券爲高，然政府發行此稱庫券之最終目的，在使法幣回籠，物價平抑，上述兩目的達到後，利息自然隨之下落，屆時美金債券之勸銷，即不受影響。至政府負担過高利息，所吸收之游資，能否超過所負利息一點，亦爲不必要之杞憂。按發行短期庫券，英法等國皆有先例，或因彌補預算而出此，或因某一特殊目的而臨時發行。我國目前所將發行之特種短期庫劵，於達成前述兩目的後，當停止發行。</p>

<h3>對日賠償問題　難期迅速解決</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十五日電〕遠東委員會及其賠償小組會，連日接到盟國個別提出之對日賠償申請，其總額之巨，絕非佔領當局所能允許。賠償問題之迅速解決遂不可能。遠東委員會上足期商定各項基礎，依據此項基礎接受賠償申請，本望賠償小組得以決定每一申請國應得之賠償品比例。聞一星期來，各申請國提出之百分比，遠過於總數，美國以太平洋主要參戰國地位，要求至少獲得日本賠償品之半數，但聲明擬將此項資產車行分給其他盟國，尤其是菲律濱與朝鮮，一小部分給英國。中國爲第二最大申淸國，要求百分之四十。菲律濱要求約百分之十五。聞英法兩國均以居申請國之第三位。其他各國認爲衡諸英法對太平洋戰爭之出力程度，此種巨額要求並不合理。遠東委員會人士感覺各盟國正在討價還價，此在其他盟國，尤其是加拿大與紐西關，則適得其反。聞加拿大僅要求百分之一·五，紐西蘭要求百分之二，此種數字，殆已不能再减。澳洲要求之成數，尙無所知。陸軍部某發言人稱：麥帥已要求加派工程師，帮助進行賠償品之分配。陸軍部並未接到關於處理日本賠償工作之誹謗。</p>

<h3>和平安定的途徑</h3>
<p>最近十幾天來，工潮，學潮，以及米潮，相繼發生，社會的紛擾不安，人心的浮動不定，幾乎無可形容；再加以物價飛漲，民生困苦，尤使多數人的心頭感到煩悶，好像不勝其沉重的壓榨。於是全國上下，幾無不渴望普遍的安定，好敎在水深米熱之中的老百姓，獲得一個稍蘇喘息的機會。</p>
<p>其實，我國在抗戰八年獲得勝利之後，創鉅痛深，政府早就應該與民休息，培養國家的元氣，而且政府也的確未始不想如此，祇因共產黨的問題，抗戰的砲火甫停，內亂的烽火又起，以致造成今日紊亂如麻的局面。在戰亂所及的地方，固然直接遭受砲火的災害，民不聊生；就是在戰亂所不及的地方，也間接蒙受其不利的影響，不僅無法改善人民的生活，而且也和戰區的人民一樣，憔悴呻吟於水深火熱之中。時到如今，格外覺得有速謀和平安定的必要了。否則長此以往，國家民族將陷於萬劫不復的困境！我們固不欲危言聳聽，但言責所在，不能不提高國人對於目前局勢的警覺，以促謀得國內和平與普遍安定的早日實現。</p>
<p>第一，我們認爲安定與和平是不可分割的。內亂一日不止，則社會安定卽一日不能完全實現。所以我們要求普遍的安定，就得先要求國內眞正和平與全面和平的實現。我們鑒於過去政府的『片面停戰』（這是政府下停戰令後周恩來指責政府的話）未能獲致國內和平，不得不向雙方呼籲，要求共產黨替全國的老百姓留下一綫生機，快快放下武器，使全國化干戈爲玉帛，並要求政府覓得稍縱卽逝的機會，恢復和談，使國內政治能化戾氣為實和。我們今天呼籲和平所以特別着重在共產黨方面者，並不是對政府有所偏袒，因爲我們相信，政府當局的渴望和平安定，甚至在一般人民之上。在過去，政府為了國內和平的實現，曾幾次頒佈停戰命令，惟因這種停戰令誠爲周恩來氏所說是「片面」的，都未能獲致和平，又政府爲了要採用政治途徑解決中共問題，不僅一再設法恢復和談，而且至今未將和談之門關閉。去年召開國民大會的時候，政府始終竭誠歡迎中共及民盟的代表參加，就是最近國府改組，中共與民盟的國府委員名額，猶虛位以待，只要中共能够覺醒，以國家民族的利益爲重，立卽放棄以武力奪取政權的企圖，乘參政會開會的時機，重新與政府進行和談，則目前政治的僵局，或可不難打開。所以國內和亂的關鍵，可說完全握在中共的手裏。誠如王寵惠氏所謂：「和談能否恢復，全在中共之一念決定，實現和平並非一方面希望所能濟事，必須中共亦具誠意，始有實現之可能。」我們以民生憔悴，向中共呼籲和平，或適足以鼓勵中共採取以戰亂促成經濟崩潰的政策，目前國內的局勢，也許正是中共所求之不得者。但是我們不得不正吿中共人士，政黨若不以民衆的福利爲前提，抉不能獲得民衆的擁戴，卽將喪失其爲政黨的本質。所以我們竭誠希望中共能够大徹大悟，以國家人民爲重，立卽放下武器，替全國的老百姓留下一綫生機。</p>
<p>第二，目下人民日夜所渴望的旣是和平與安定，在政府當局自應竭盡所能，力求和平與安定的提早實現。現在政府業已改組完成，民靑兩黨以及社會賢達，也已參加，與國民黨共負國家的重任，對於國內和平與安定的實現，不啻增加一個新的因素。同時新政府在改組後所發表的施政方針，也以力謀國內安定及於鐵路交通恢復後仍用政治途徑解決共產黨問題爲重點。可見今日的政府，實負有獲致和平與安定的責任。改組後的政府，論其性質，雖似爲行憲以前一種過渡政府，其唯一的任務，乃在完成實施憲政所必需的一切準備工作，但是實施憲政與國內的和平安定，也是不可分割的，若不能獲致和平安定，則卽實施憲政，在民主的意義上還是有缺憾的。所以，我們希望改組後的政府，千萬不可自認爲臨時政府，而忽略其對淤國家所負的重任。須知政府縱爲過渡，而責任依然一貫。今後政府的一切施政措置，應有輕重緩急之分。凡是重要的急切的，經過縝密研究採取辦法之後，就該集中全力，不惜任何代價，求其貫澈；反之，凡屬於次要的不急之務，應該暫置緩圖。我們在上面已經說過，今日全國上下所一致要求的固然是和平與安定，張羣院長就戰時向全國人民所提供的諾言，也是和平與安定，今後政府應當以此爲一切努力的總方向。在積極方面，應設法早日獲致全面和平的實現；在消極方面，也應竭力避免足以刺激社會不安的措施。今日工潮，學潮，以及米潮的不斷發生，原因固屬多端，而當局的手忙脚亂，舉棋不定，似也不能辭其責。政府對於任何新的措施，與其輕舉妄動，母寗愼重將事。我們雖在此時不能鼓吹『無爲而治，』但在人心浮動之際，一切刺激物價，鼓動民衆的言行，都應儘量避免。唯有如此，始不致於紛擾紊亂之中，再增加社會的不安！</p>
<p>第三，我們還要本着『反求諸己』的精神，呼籲全國老百姓，羣起而敎力於和平安定的運動，從而表現出人民的眞實力量來。過去和談的失敗，原因固不一而足，但是其中最重要的，還在政府只知重視黨派的意見，而忽略了正直人民的意見　老實說，目下中國的黨派雖然衆多，我們假定各黨都擁有相當數目的羣衆，但是它的羣衆和與全國人民的總數相比較，實在還是少數。老百姓到了今日，爲本身利益計，同時也爲國家的利益計，不應長此保特緘默，不能不站起來自己說話了。政府要獲致和平安定的實現，以前對各黨派的意見也聽够了，今後應格外多聽聽全國人民的呼聲。因爲唯有解除人民的痛苦，始能謀得社會的安定，而人民的痛苦祇有眞正的人民才會了解‘但人民將用何法以表示意見呢。在我們老百姓，也要知道，惟有用合法的手段，向政府說出民間的疾苦，堅決要求政府採取合理的政策，始能謀得社會的安定。所以，我們一方面希望政府能够特別重視全國的民意，另一方面也希望全國人民都能站起來說老實話。這樣，上下溝通，綜合各方面的意見，自然可以產生和平安定的方案。只要上下都能恪守遵行，就不難達到其目的。更具體地說，比較能代表民意的機構，不論是卽將開會的國民參政會，或是國民大會代表所組成的意政實施促進會，都應該在此時期立卽公開討論，如何可以强制政府和共黨軍隊的立卽就地停戰，而迫使雙方不能不切實遵行。政府如果還要集思廣益，則各省市參議會的正副議長，全國性民間團體的首腦，以及文化敎育工商經濟界的領袖，多少可以代表此時的眞正民意的，較之黨派意見應該有價値得多，政府也儘可以召集到首大，更把共黨代表也請來共聽人民的申訴。他們都是來自民間，自知民間的疾苦，自可發表人民的希望。政府只有解除民間的疾苦，達到人民的希望，始能謀得社會的安定。</p>

<h3>杜魯門致函國會　促速通過救濟案</h3>

<h3>今後三四年內　美將作鉅額貸欵　每年將達五十億美元</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕美國四億元援助希土計劃通過實施後，進一步應作何種措置，爲一般人所關心之問題。華盛頓人士漸漸相信美國在今後三四年內爲實施杜魯門防共政策，每年約將貸款五十億元，子各所需之國家。此數雖爲私人之估計，然乃出諸高級官方人士者，華萊士在芝加哥演說時亦引用該項數字指爲恢復歐亞人民生活永準之所必需者。目前援助希土計劃旣已通過，政府下一步驟即爲爭取國會與人民支持其全球性之數十億元之援助計劃。據詳縝之估計，世界各國在今年內當自美國獲得價値一百六十億之物資，而美國之進口貨將爲此數之一半，即八十億。差額中之三十億元可由各國之黃金與外匯以及美人在各該國使用之美金票償付，然其餘五十億元祇能由美國貸予各國之借款償付，此後兩三年內大約應有類似之差額。</p>

<h3>英下院辯論外交　貝文力言下屆外長會議重要性　希望四強防德公約能終於實現</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕下院今日起舉行爲期兩日之外交辯論，具文外相聲言十一月間在倫敦舉行之外長會議，或將爲世界史上最重要之會議，若東西間之關係不能進入較前更滿意的狀態，則沒有一人能預料世界今後之途徑。貝文對四强公約之未獲協議表示深刻遺憾，渠云英法及各西方國家，均認美國建議之四强防德公約，爲一極度重要之事件，不幸蘇聯提出與此事並無直接關係之修正意見，並表示否則即不能接受美國之建議。　覺美國於此實已響應世界各地要求東西提携之呼聲，美國意在於兩大意見之間，建立溝通之橋梁，此項聯繫之樹立，足以變更世界琳務之途徑。深盼在十一月倫敦外長會議之前，能建立可以進行訂立此一條約之空氣。希望此一條約終有成爲事實之一日。貝文復認美國建議之四强防德公約，預示世界事務之路程，將有如何之變化，故在倫敦外長會議召開前，必須迭成使此一建議得被採用之空氣。貝文又謂，由於戰爭之結果，整個中歐必須重建，此項一作之拖延，使困難必更見增多，故目前亟應着手組織德國之下一階段工作。貝文於檢討莫斯科會議之工作時，表示並無推翻波茨坦協定之意，第欲使其全部實現，不能僅事擇取其中之一部份。英政府並未拒絕考慮以德工業生產作爲賠償，但覺事有先後，應首先處理者爲德國之經濟統一，平衡的經濟以及自佔領德國以來，英國爲維持德國之生存所代墊費用之償還，此乃合法之要求，此次要求解決以後，即可進而討論以工業生產品賠償之問題。貝文繼述及德波疆界問題，表示英國在宣布其最後決議以前，必須先就事實問題予以研究，但渠認波　不能因其東部土地之劃入蘇聯，而轉向德國獲取補償。關於德境英美區經濟合併事，貝文認為德國以及全歐利益計，必須使其視為經濟緊急行動而執行。關於德境之糧食危機，渠認再過三月，配給可望改善，最後渠表示希望並相信英美區之合併協定，當能促成德國之統一。</p>
<h3>外長會無成就　艾登歸咎蘇聯</h3>

<h3>日四黨幹事長三次會談　新閣政策獲協議　保守派仍反對社會黨出任首相</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十六日電〕第三次四黨幹事長會談已於本日午後二時在衆院議長室舉行。社會黨西尾書記長，自由黨大野幹事長，民主黨薩田幹事長及國民協同黨三木政務調查會長均出席，關於政策協定之談判，會談中已獲得協調通過。其內容：（一）重要產業歸國家管理。（二）建設爲阻止通貨膨脹之健全財政統制金融制度。（三）繼綾支付國債利息。（四）改善收買食米制度。關於首相及閣僚分配比率二問題，留待十七日再討論，惟自由民主兩黨對片山出任首相一事，態度俱頗保留。片山本人對此問題亦甚愼重，現決定於十七日分別訪自由黨總裁吉田，民主黨最高顧問齋籐二氏，交換意見。</p>
<p>〔國際社東京十六日電〕日本聯合內閣之組織工作，今已開始其第二階段之首相人選及閣僚分配步驟。自由民主兩黨對此目前表曾表示：「首相應由多數決定」，使保守政黨更加强其「首相應由佔議席最大多數之保守派中選任」之信心。十五日自由黨於舉行黨內幹部會議時，對於大野幹事長堅持「不能同意社會黨出任首相」之主張，均曾一致表示擁護。民主黨雖因黨內總裁人選問題，幣原，蘆田，齋藤等三派各持一見，然對社會黨出任首相事則一致亦示反對甚烈，故自由民主兩黨對於聯合內閣尤其首相人選所持之主張，顯有可能採取同一步驟之趨勢。</p>

<p>片山發表　施政計劃</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社美國地德羅十五日電〕前副總統華萊士今晚在此發表演說，力言黨派政治正導致美國於不景氣，並招致另一項悲慘的世界大戰。華氏稱：渠最近歐洲之行，乃以遞信者之資格搜索防衛世界團之力量。目前之困難倘若繼續，吾人將遭遇經濟囊落，目前之外交政策倘若繼續，吾人將遭遇強暴與流血，終有一日不能避免戰爭。其補救之適，厥惟爲參戰軍人樹立善後救濟計劃實行累進的所得稅，發展天然資源，禁止種族歧視，减低物價及保持消費者之購買力。至於美國之內政政策而論，徒使富者愈富，貧者愈貧，自由者愈不自由。華氏最後指責杜魯門總統之政策，目的在分散英國之大批眾隊，而削弱英國之力量。此種政策，旣在削弱工黨，則世界之團結無望矣，華氏復稱：余游歷歐洲時，發現斯坎的那維亞半島恐懼杜魯門政策或將導致戰爭。法國之輿情認爲杜魯們主義造成法國各黨間之裂口，並擁護戴高樂推翻議會政治之行動。美國之政策實爲戴高樂之主要工具，余茲欲詢問美國駐法大使蒲立德與戴高樂樹立關係，是否得到國務院之認可。</p>

<h3>加強管制火油　配貨數量　按月呈報</h3>
<p>公用局社會局爲管制火油價格問題，昨日上午召集德士古，亞細亞，美孚三公司代表，商談今後配油事宜，經決定三公司以後配售各火油商人之火油，按月呈報社會局，俾便管制。據記者探悉，本年第二期火油，將於短期內配出，屆時火油價格，可望下降。按目前價格，每市斤漲至二千二百元，其原因，以輸入管理委負會限制結購外匯，所運抵本市之火油，因無法結購外匯，悉數封存倉庫，以致外間火油價格飛漲，此次配售後，社會局將召集各有關方面議定火油價格，並予以管制，以防止價格上漲云。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕最近密勒氏评論報普論抨擊我國之監獄制度，及地院審判外人案件情形，記者爲此趨訪地院院長查良鑑，叩詢法院近來情形及監所改善問題，承發表談話如次：（一）中國司法方面力求改進，已有顯普之進步，美國名法學家龐德（R．Found）曾評論我國司法制度及法律敎育稱：「中國的法典是很完善的，其中有很多顯著的優點可與任何現代法典媲美」。（二）地院於卅五年度受理民事案件八九一一起，刑事案件一四一三五起、內民事涉外案件三一六起，刑事涉外案件三六八起，審判時均本公正精神，及客觀態度。（三）幾件重要的涉外案件，有美國人羅傑士傷書案、賴令奈敎唆傷害致人於死案、梅斯伯違反經濟緊急措施案，均秉公辦理，力求無枉無縱，科處罪刑，尤極審愼。（四）關於保證金制度，按法院得使債權人提供現金担保後，命爲假扣押，或假執行，此爲民事訴訟法所明定，又被吿犯罪嫌疑重大，而聲請停止覊押者、應提出保證書或相當之保證金額，亦為刑事訴訟法所明定，實則中國法律此種規定，尚係仿效外國而來。（五）監所改善問題：上海原有化新涇及漕河涇之兩大新式監獄，可容一萬三千餘人，惜燬於戰火，現有監所容量旣小、不免擁擠，惟在國家經濟極度困難之時、上海監所均先後呈准撥發巨款興修，亦可證司法當局之苦心。至於衛生方面，亦頗注重，有監獄醫院之設立，時對犯人施打防疫針，並用DDT等藥品、消毒殺虫、犯人疾病，因此頓减。其他一切設施，距離理想尙遠，嗣後當力求改進，以期達到完善境地。戰後復員，百廢待　，我監所設施，能在困難中求進步，諒爲中外人士所共　、須知中國法院監所今日尙在力求改進時期，無論中外人士，凡有對此目標能善意貢獻意見，如屬力之所及，莫不虛心接收。</p>

<h3>響應中大罷課　金大學生昨請願</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕私立金大學生，響應中大罷課請願運動，十五日下午起罷課，十六日赴敎部政院請願，提出五點要求：（一）按照生活指數，增加公費生副食費至每月十萬元；（二）半公費生及自費生，普遍改爲公費生；（三）敎育經費保持總預算百分之十五；（四）增加私立學校經費；（五）立刻停止內戰。全體上午集隊赴敎部請願時，杭立武次長稱：公費制度，乃戰時制度，戰後舊公費生已减少百分之三十，現全國共有公費生十三萬人，本年敎育經費减少，故第一二兩項不能辦到，第三項爲整個問題，第四項敎部給與金大之補助費最多，現無法再予增加。第五項敎部無法答覆。學生不滿所答，羣相質難，然亦無法獲得結果。午後至政院請願，欲見張院長，同時派代表與副院長王雲五接洽，當由王雲五下樓與全體學生講話。時學生均已進入政院辦公大樓大門，席地而坐，若干人已越樓梯，登二樓。王氏稱：對於半公費生，自費生，改爲公費生事，目前無法考慮。而增加副食費一事，且已於今晨召集臨時政務會議討論，決增至四萬八千元，每個人似並不多，但以全體學生計，爲數即甚大。同時決定以後每三個月調整一次，非公費生改爲公費生一事，無法照准。王氏答覆完畢，學生認爲不滿，再度責難，認爲王氏應立即予以圓滿答覆。王氏雖稱「本人爲政院副院長」，亦立爲學生哄聲所噓。王因開會離院，乃由甘秘書長續談，告以「行總在金大所辦經濟食堂，原定即將結束，院方已決與行總人員接洽續辦，予學生以救濟特遇，至本學期止」。其餘則與王答覆者同，終無結果。六時許，政院職員開晚餐，學生擁至食堂，喧賓奪主，食而後罷。學生代表暨校長敎授，續與甘浦兩秘長洽談，至九時四十分商定：「（一）與行總洽商擴大經濟食堂，目前由校担保　款理；（二）半公費生，自費生，改公費生事，待與各校取得聯絡後，再行決定」，全體始離政院，十七日仍續罷課。</p>
<h3>二屆自費留學生　將作全體性請願　要求給照結滙早日出國</h3>

<h3>政院昨開臨時政務會議　決定學主副食費　每人每月為四萬八千元</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕中大學生十六日起，休止罷課五天，其原因爲政院王副院長答覆，在政務會中討論彼等之要求，故在政務會議前，堅持罷課，已無實效，彼等俟政務會議後有圓滿結果，再行復課。惟十六日竟日雖名曰休止罷課，實際仍在停課狀態中。政院十六日開臨時政務會議，決定學生副食費爲每人每月四萬八千元，距學生要求仍遠。中大學生自治會當晚再召開系科大會，決定十七日行動。該會十六日發表「爲請求增加公費再度宣言」，內容略稱：根據王副院長朱部長對五項要求之答覆，共有兩點：（一）國家目前經濟極度困難，敎育經費，增加實在不易。（二）每月四萬八千元的副食費，巳够維持生活，然就政府預算來說，其十萬元之要求，乃係有所根據者，因過去敎育經費極甚可憐，僅佔總預算百分之四點八五，其中尚包括黨團經費開支，現黨團已不得在敎育費項下支取，且依據憲法規定，增加敎育經費爲總預算的百分之十五，此種增加之經費，尚有學生吃飯費用在內。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕若干報紙登載政院王副院長，昨對中大學生談話中，有曾允公費生每人借發副食費五萬元一簡，政院某高級負責人頃對記者發表如一下之聲明：「王副院長昨談話中，並無此語，祗允將請願事件提請行政院會議決定，如確屬急切需款，可就政府業已核定之數目借發半個月。」</p>

<h3>征輪隊發揮威力　仁餘第三度屈服　五五比二九形勢一面倒</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕洛陽征輪籃球隊三勝仁餘，昨晚作來滬後第二戰，又以五十五比二十九獲勝，上半時二十八比十五，客軍領前。征輪作戰，更入佳境，昨晚仁餘初期尚能抵抗，此後遂成追隨局面。觀衆約計六七百人，較第一戰大爲熱鬧。賽前，仁餘隊長陳渭源獻旗，客軍由蔡忠强領受。</p>
<p>征輪猛襲</p>
<p>時間旣因，裁判兪菊臚，倪孝本，登場執法，征輪以蔡忠强，劉政軍，于瑞章，屠文龍，王秉煥臨陣，仁餘以姚文彝，沈鵬舉，王槐庭，徐仲己，吳新運登塲，中圈跳球，展開序幕，仁餘沈鵬舉百步穿楊，首破籃圈。屠文龍犯親，姚文彝罰球獲分，仁餘以三對〇前導，征輪呼停，密商對策。徐仲己犯規，征輪王秉煥罰中，扳回一分，于瑞章籃下竄入，劉政軍翻身鵠中，征輪反以五比三領先。仁餘吳新運罰中，征輪蔡忠强擲罰俱中，屠文龍錦上添花，轉瞬以十比四佔優勢。姚文彝底角破籃，于瑞章罰球得點，王秉煥領空鵠中，仁餘雖傾全力反攻，難挽頽勢，廿比八時，仁餘初度呼停，果見小姚先中，徐仲己揮入，奈征輪緊迫不捨，于瑞章蔡忠强又見順手，仁餘無法抬頭，迨蔡忠强反手命中，上半時隨之完畢，征輪以廿八比十五佔先。</p>
<p>節節進展</p>
<p>休息過後，易陣再戰，征輪蔡忠強籃下托入，屠文龍揮中紅心，蔡忠强再告得手，卅七比十五遙領，仁餘再度呼停，並以陳渭源進塲，替出徐仲己。渭源百步穿楊，于瑞章蔡忠强相繼報復，征輪節節進展，以四十三比十七佔絕對優勢。仁餘征輪同時呼停，藉紓緊張情緒，屠文龍破籃，吳新運立刻回敬，沈鵬舉再獲一球，仁餘似見轉機，但最後四分鐘，征輪又活躍，劉政軍長射告中，仁餘苦戰，王槐庭籃下得手，然于瑞章又跟之中的，五四比廿九時，征輪呼停，迨王秉煥罰中，法定時間終了，征輪以五十五比廿九，再勝仁餘。</p>

<h3>濟市女運動員新慧星</h3>
<p>訪問兩位打破全國紀錄的小姐</p>
<p>〔本報濟南航訊〕濟南私立　範女子中學，最近舉行春季運動會，學生徐玫琳王燦華對跳高，標槍鐵球三項，突破全國紀錄，記者特往訪問。原來該校係濟市有名敎會女校之于，創辦以來，已近廿載，校舍初在城內，後遷東門郊外二華里，進築典麗，環境淸幽，體育塲雖不算很大，但所有女子體育設備，已應有盡有。校中規定，所有學生，一律住校，故每于課餘之暇，對體育都普遍注意，平均發展，體育主任王靜波，在該校任職，前後共已十三年，經此長期領導訓練下，故有如斯成就，實非偶然。</p>
<p>記者往訪時，由柯樹德司鐸（外籍）王就先光生介紹，與兩小姐見面：</p>
<p>徐玫琳小姐，淄川人，活潑而大方，身材相當高，是位典型的北方女性，今年還只十九歲，日來因小病初愈，體力尚未全部復原，據她說：從小因有一位喜歡運動的哥哥，在家便設着跳高架，于是在哥哥的薰陶下，便養成了她對體育的興趣。這次該校春季運動會中，跳高成績是一米四〇，打破了過去朱天眞小姐也是一位山東人所保持的一米三五點五的全國紀錄。　熗二九米五〇，打破了上屆全運會廿八米五五的紀錄。</p>
<p>王燦華，泰安人，廿歲，由外形上看，就可知她體格的茁壯，不愧一標準運動員。她的氣力相當大，本屆鐵球成績是一一米九〇，突破原有一〇米三五的全國紀錄。此外，據她的老師王靜波說：她的鐵餅成績爲三〇米，亦頗接近三〇米〇五的全國紀錄。</p>
<p>濟南市運動會，定本（五）月十六，十七分兩日舉行，她們屆時都將參加，遺憾的是該會因經費支　，標槍價昂，本屆暫不列入競賽項目，但她們都希望雙十節全運會在滬舉行時，有一獻身手的機會，她們年華正靑，今年都是高中二年級，百尺竿頭，力圖精進，米來前途，正未可限呢！（本報特派員麗天寄）</p>

<h3>財長及中央銀行負責人談　外匯放長全係謠言　在物價波動時不能再加刺激</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕滬傳外匯即將調整，記者特往訪財政部兪部長鴻鈞，據兪部長表示，純係投機者散佈謠言，並非事實。</p>
<p>日來又盛傳外匯即將放長，證劵市塲復起漲風。據中央銀行負責人談：外匯放長，目前決無考慮及此。投機家故意散佈謠言，從中取巧，冀獲暴利，此爲一貫之故技。頭腦如不冷靜，誤中其計，實咎由自取。又撇有關方面消息：政府在今日動亂之現狀中，應求安定，當前物價波動，如外匯再有變動，物價將更受刺激。過去已有若干敎訓，因牽涉甚大，不宜輕易從事。關於出口事業，政府已另有辦法補救。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕近日市塲盛傳外匯掛牌將調整至二萬五千元，因之各物均又回升，記者茲走訪出口業及有關金融業方面，徵詢各權威意見：茲歸納如下：（一）美匯掛牌，依照近月來物價之激漲，及黑市匯票之猖獗，果如提高至二萬五千元，亦不得謂之過高。（二）進口貨品，現已均照黑市外匯價格計其成本。（三）出口商業，目前幾已全部停頓，政府最近雖有收購之計劃，倘掛牌能提高至適當數目，則出口當更覺活動。（四）自二月間外匯調整以後，僑匯見增，比來以黑市外匯價格，相差二倍，故僑匯多已流入黑市，倘能及時改變，則僑匯頭寸亦可拉回不少。以上各項，均爲見仁見智之談，姑誌之以供探討。</p>
<h3>游資盡力吸納　華股繼續漲停</h3>
<p>華股昨有新多頭參加吸收籌碼，永紗暗市幾將迫近今日限度，北帮游資盡力吸納，全塲漲停者達十之八九。物價狂升，港申電慘跌，股市自易掀動買風。</p>
<p>晨開見俏，麗安美亞首告漲停，遞永紗開後，一八八號即有賣出而回落至六四四〇元。一四號一一二號三一號七七號三五五號二二二號一〇二號一九七號來進，檯面極涸，即躍升至漲停。新光信和勸興大通榮豐永公統益景福新亞商務咸告漲達限度，入後八五號一一二號七七號一八〇號一九九號再進，暗市遞永紗喊高至六九〇〇元，遞信和亦加二十元有成交。一一七號一四八號六〇號一四號一五二號脫售，降至六八二〇元，九四號一二九號一四號復進而迫七千元關，二二號一九七號一四八號一〇四號六〇號三號四號八九號一八三號紛售，十時二十五分曾退入漲停以內，二二三號一五三號一五四號一二九號一六〇號進胃仍殷，升至六八五〇元。八九號一五三號一八三號再賣小至漲停以下，二二三號七七號一六〇號一五九號二三號一五七號一七一號九四號連續買進，港申電報縮至十六元七五，近午回漲甚返，遞永紗躍升至七一〇〇元外。一五三號等逢高了結，午收退爲七〇五〇元左右。結果較前收計永紗美亞永公新光信和漲停，新華景福漲停後有回，各升一成有零。遞交計永紗美亞信和新光景福漲停，勤興漲停後有回，漲起一成强。冷股計榮鹽統益商務麗安新亞漲停，中絲中紡漲停後有回，軋漲半成强。火柴亦升一成弱。</p>
<p>午後除漲停者達十之九外，遞永紗七千元開盤後，九四號北帮續納升爲七〇五〇元以上，此後忽傳有征收特證二成之說賣風大盛。七六號一一二號二八號三五號六一號一五三號四號二一三號脫手，遞永紗步降至六七七〇元。始轉盤旋，一七二號六五號二三二號七六號來進，港申電又縮至十六元半。暗盤後回升至七一〇〇元外。四號八五號一四號脫售，退爲六九五〇元。一八八號一七一號一一七號九四號六〇號八五號八九號紛購，遞永紗暗市竟拉高至七二五〇元左右。六一號一五二號等賣出，始告下落，收後喊低至七一〇〇元內結束。結果較前收計中絲新華水泥漲停後有回，各漲一成有零。遞交勤興漲停後有回，亦漲成半弱。餘者一致漲停，塲外各股一致回　一成强。</p>
<p>統債徘徊</p>
<p>公債昨形勢徘徊，統丙晨開一七〇〇〇元，自一七三〇〇元退至一五九〇〇元，午刻在一六五〇〇元左右掙扎。五〇三室五五二室有納，三六〇室五五〇室則出。較前收計甲乙升七百元，丁戊漲一千元，統丙僅告微升。成交約五百萬有零。</p>
<p>外股盤跌</p>
<p>外股昨由堅盤跌，證劵帮及散戶有納，北帮廣帮錢兌業均售，洋行帮對鋼業會德豐紙業三者較有納胃，怡紗晨開八四五〇〇元，自八二五〇〇元升至八八〇〇〇元而後有回，午後步降至八二〇〇〇元低價結束。結果較前收計業廣漲一成，會德豐升半成，電話微挫，餘股均告微升。</p>
<h3>棉布市况挺秀</h3>
<p>昨日棉布開市時，人心頗形軟弱，因前日紡建公司供售之十二磅龍頭細布，有倒貼四千元，四君子金印元嗶嘰倒貼二千元，餘如挨號派售之元府綢及元細布均能加價三千元交易。迨至十一時許，聞證劵再度漲停，紗價續挺，業中人心思急遽轉變，紛紛補購紡建之申購單，蓋因前日申購者稀少，雖紡建公司龍頭細布及四君子元嗶嘰全數照派，而籌碼不充，形勢求過於供，致龍頭細布加價一萬三千元，四君子元嗶嘰加九千元，仍難補進，是以最後結果十二磅龍頭細布做高至廿八萬八千元，比上日績升一萬五千元，其餘五福藍鷄彩球等牌亦好一萬元至一萬五六千元，漂布粗布直貢及元布色布士林布亦一致跟升自五六千元至二萬餘元。</p>
<h3>中糧工業公司　決定轉爲民營</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國糧食工業公司已於上月十日董事會中通過將該公司轉爲民營之原則，並已擬就具體辦法，陳報糧食部轉呈政院決定。中糧公司之現有重要資產如下：（一）重慶區—米廠麵廠各一個，（二）漢口區米廠麵廠各一個，。南京區油廠一，米廠三，（四）蕪湖米廠一，（五）無錫米廠一。共有職工三百餘人。惟因若干工廠廠屋均爲租用者，故總値不大。</p>
<h3>台幣對法幣比率　改爲一比四四</h3>
<p>台灣銀行奉令實行</p>
<p>台灣銀行上海分行昨奉總行電令，對於台幣對法幣之比率，已改爲一比四四，較原定之一比四〇計高四元，昨日起由滬匯款赴台灣者即照此比率折算。</p>
<h3>工業原料高翔</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕工業原料，前以黑市港匯騰升，各物一再跟漲，後以銀根緊迫，散戶出籠頗多，故一度趨軟。前昨以匯謠四起，人心轉堅，燒碱，漂粉，N松香，純碱，凡士林等行商競力吸收，又復騰踊甚烈。</p>
<h3>產地價格回挫　米糧來源漸增　麵粉價續見低跌數千元</h3>
<p>米市昨南北共到七千三百餘石，內地價格亦趨平庸，市塲實銷仍懈，來源漸增。粳米高貨平平，中下回跌三五千元，早薄稻及秈米均見步跌四五千元。白元提高殺次甚烈，陰元亦然高平次削。</p>
<p>麵粉蚌埠亦有到中，內地回挫，隨之下降，續見猛跌四五千元。麩皮鄉銷尚可，回升千元。豆餅續昂千元。</p>
<p>油市略有參差，豆油供求兩平，形居穩定之格，生油去化俏俐，微挺三五千元。蔴油淸油菜油均一致下挫萬元，黃豆銷塲轉懈，重見下游，回小二三千元。赤豆呆滯之極，逐步下跌三五千元</p>
<p>生仁交易甚淡，疲軟之局。芝蔴萎靡不振，續疲三五千元。苞米堅挺，紅糧酒坊問津較殷，疲而復振，回升一二千元。荼豆依然沉悶乏交，再低五六千元。</p>
<h3>白糖市勢略緊</h3>
<p>聞台公司配額昨已決定，每一單位最高額爲四百包，公會糖市漸趨平定。白糠以前日下降過甚，昨稍回好。秘魯砂初爲三十八萬五千元。旋升至三十九萬八千元，後爲三十九萬三千元，升一萬八千元。二四粗白棧單四十一萬五千元，二四中砂白三十九萬五千元，各升五千元。四半軍白仍四十萬元，三半車白三十九萬元，升一萬元。台赤三十二萬元，汕靑無更動，刁靑二十四萬五千元，興化白回升萬餘元，爲三十八萬五千元至三十七萬五千元。興赤二十八萬五千元至二十七萬五千元。</p>
<h3>大豆暫無輸出</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕近來國際市　對大豆之需要仍殷，我國因需調劑國內需給，暫無輸出。惟悉：世界各地大豆之供應情况，日見好轉，故大豆之國際市價，仍將看低云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕中央信託局經運之大豆，前曾有一批計四千噸，運送抵滬。茲悉：該局最近又有大豆六千噸，在營口裝船，預計日內當可抵滬云。</p>
<h3>易貨仍未開展　我無貨輸蘇</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：中蘇間之易貨問題，迄仍無開展，惟蘇聯不時有煤斤，白報紙，海帶等物資，陸續裝抵此間入口，聞該項物資，十九來自庫頁南島，我國則迄未有貨輸往蘇聯。至我國每年由中央信託局經運赴蘇之磚茶，生絲，桐油等物資，則均係爲償付我國對蘇之債務，並無貿易關係。聞該項債務，將至一九五二年，方能全部淸償。每年淸償各種物資之價款，約在美金七八百萬元這間云。</p>
<h3>活動房屋　暫停進口</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸管會息：關於活動房屋之進口，應視同整體，歸入稅則第六七二號，屬附表三（乙）應暫停進口。惟現悉：如爲特殊建設，及去年十一月十七日以前付款之定貨，可予考慮進口云。</p>
<h3>政府對出口物價　收購計劃已擬定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕桐油猪鬃等主要出口物資，近來國際市場價格，日趨下游。國內各地採辦商，採辦後無法發動外銷，乃紛紛眨價傾銷，致國際市價愈趨下跌。</p>
<p>茲聞各地採辦商，紛請當局，對該項物資，予以收購。俾對內能調劑谷商金融，然後再統籌推動外銷。現聞該項請求，已獲行政院通過，並已產生收購計劃，交由中央信託局經辦。中信局方面刻正研究其實施之步驟，聞該項收購計劃，係屬全國性云。</p>
<h3>紗布運漢審核簡則　棉紡業不願接受　將由公會備文轉陳經部核示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據第六區棉紡公會理事長王啓宇氏談稱：紡管會日前頒行之紗布輸往漢口申請審核簡則，及紗布轉運給證簡則，棉紡業界認爲不能接受。緣照已頒行之管制紗布運銷辦法，全國東北，河北，漢口，及華南四地區，均在管制運銷之列，於棉紡業前途之發展，殊多窒碍。而管制紗布轉運，亦嫌約束過嚴，同業中咸認爲不能接受，要求當局將日前所頒之二項新簡則，予以撤銷。渠爲此事曾於昨日商諸紡管會吳兼主委，聞吳氏對棉紡業要求，頗表同情，當着該業公會先備呈文，申述理由，以便轉陳經濟部核示云。</p>
<h3>紗價初堅後降</h3>
<p>昨日現紗市况：初開時以聞外匯有調整之訊，人心激奮，而新多搜求甚衆。塲中四二支藍鳳做高至一千二百三十萬元，旋以同業銀根仍緊，反而吐出軋舒頭寸，致價遂告回降。最後四二支藍鳳回小至一千一百九十萬元，比上日只漲十萬元。二十支特雙馬升二三十萬元，其他三二支及十六支紗，因毛巾廠襪廠納意懈怠，價反軋降。</p>
<p>紡建公司昨照例售紗，塲上進提閑散，喊價微有參差。</p>
<p>康福織造敵　股票將上市</p>
<p>康福織造廠股份有限公司，昨日下午三時舉行增資後第一次股東會，由張鴻勳主席，報告增資足額，監察馬雲龍騐資證明。董事傅良駿，王鶯，姚思偉，沈天德等咸出席。聞該廠股票不久即將上市，現塲外七十元有成交，茂昌股票行爲該股之代理人云。</p>
<p>美金債券　募銷統計</p>

<h3>中國農民銀行舉辦　棉花菸葉生產貸款　總額一千六百四十六億餘元　中央銀行准先透借五百億元</h3>
<p>中國農民銀行以我國棉區頗廣，惟產量品質均不足以應當前需要，致外棉輸入數字驚人，今後自應積極增加產量，改善品質，該行本年度爲配合農林部推廣美棉計劃，擬在河北陝西等十二省舉辦美種棉花生產貸款，預計推廣畝數爲一千二百萬畝，平均每畝貸放一萬元，計一千二百億元，用途爲購買美棉種子及肥料。農具。防治病虫害藥械。暨支付工資，又擬設軋花打包廠，購置機件，建築廠房倉庫，共需一百〇六億元。再菸葉亦爲重要原料，其產銷狀况，大致與棉花相同，每年外菸輸入，漏巵甚鉅，中農行本年爲配合農林部推廣美菸計劃，擬貸放美菸生產及加工貸款共二百八十億零三千五百萬元，生產部份擬推廣五十二萬畝，貸放一百五十六億元，（貸款用途與棉花生產貸款同）加工部份，擬貸修理烤房十五億元，烤烟煤炭貸款一百〇九億元，建築示範烤房三千五百萬元，以上棉花於葉生產貸款共計一千六百四十六億三千五百萬元。茲悉：中農行以資金短絀，呈請四聯總處准向中央銀行轉抵押，該案業經核准，先行透支五百億元。茲將中國農民銀行透借款項地點及數額錄后：重慶十一億，漢口六四億，長沙一四億，貴陽二億，上海七八億，福州一四億，南昌二一億，杭州五四億，蕪湖四五億，鄭州一〇七億，靑島一一億，天津一三億，西安六〇億，太原六億，共計五百億元。</p>

<p>煤市烟煤去化仍呆，市况沉寂，行市疲途徘徊。白煤塊據赴漢轉購同業來電稱，此間白煤行市雖低，然焦作塊老籠塊等高檔貨存底亦薄，採辦者僅運購少　量萍鄉焦及藍田焦，故近日煤市速日下挫，唯獨白煤塊堅穩愈恒，蓋產地無現貨應市云。</p>

<h3>生絲存底不充　漲風難望下挫　人造絲及綢貨繼續高漲</h3>
<p>生絲漲勢方興未艾，人心一致看好。據業中人謂：絲市漲勢，一時難望下挫，其原因有三：（一）同業銀根轉鬆，（二）新絲成本預計必高於現時市價，（三）去年存低不充，總計不及五千担，以供內銷綢廠而言，僅敷兩三月之需。由於上述原因之所繫，外銷縱不好轉，但市勢所趨，價仍難回平云</p>
<p>昨市人造絲繼續高漲，一二〇號高山有光八百〇五萬元，開盤後又冉冉上升，最大到八百二十萬元。迄午因股市略回，不乏乘高脫售，於是人心漸軟，卒做七百六十萬元收盤。下午開盤，又告重振，由八百萬元而到八百二十萬元，比上日高九十萬元。七五號半光，亦跟隨喊大一百萬元</p>
<p>廠絲昨市較上日略靜，喊價一致提高六七十萬元不等，只有C字等級做開二千萬元，高檔另担亦喊此價，另担陳貨喊一千九百萬元，干經乏人過問，喊價未見前進。</p>
<p>綢貨因原料又見高昂，廠盤俱告提高，且銀根漸鬆，交易亦漸活動。昨市美亞被面喊八百六十萬元，大誠格子　縐較上日大起一千五百元，人造絲貨亦高百分之四五之譜，盛杭等貨昨價均一致高漲。</p>

<h3>「法蘭西的悲劇」舊調重彈？　第四共和舞台面</h3>
<p>— 巴黎五月二日航訊　本報特派員毛澍清</p>
<p>法蘭西，第一個燃點起自由火炬的國家。沒有一七八九年巴士的監獄的流血，全世界的民主革命，也許還要拉遲幾十年。第一次歐戰以後，法蘭西是陸軍最强的國家，凡爾賽和會席上，克萊蒙梭的鼻子一哼，國際外交，又得風雲變幻。但是，曾幾何時，三星期丟了「馬奇諾」，第二次世界大戰進行的中途，國際塲合中，看不見了法蘭西的名字。</p>
<p>法國式民主　大異於英美</p>
<p>戴高樂稱這二十一年間的蛻變，呌做「法國的墮落」。作家莫洛亞，寫了一本書呌做「法蘭西的悲劇」，墮落也罷，悲劇也罷。意思都指法國「國運」的衰頹。他們兩個對於衰頽的原因，有一種比較相同的看法，那便是變相的，不澈底的所謂「民主政治」在作祟。二十一年之間，法國換了將近一百次的內閣。黨派多，意見雜，行政效能低。再加上法國都市人的先天的「享樂主義」，安逸，玩，使他們忘記了警惕，忘記了比安逸更重要的國防。我前年在巴黎的時候，聽一位法國朋友講「天寳故事」，他說：一九一九年凡爾賽會議開會的時候，法國參謀總部每天派了陸軍飛機，在巴黎上空巡視警戒，那時候，飛機工業還在萌芽時期，法國的數量最多。但是，等到一九三九年，希特勒大動干戈的時候，法國的飛機，反而一架都看不見了。</p>
<p>好容易，軸心打敗了，法國依然還是戰勝國之一，我在美國的　一年多之中，只看見法國在國際塲中的地位，逐步高升，四强變成五强，法蘭西擠了進去。五强又變爲四强，把中國擠了出來。紐約大學的外交敎授霍琪士，某次對我說：法國之所以能取中國而代之，就因爲她能自己內部團結。霍琪士敎授的話，顯然有警惕中國的好意。但是，他接著又說：共產黨能用民衆投票的方式，變成國會的多數黨，一點不假外力的要狹，法蘭西還是第一個。問題在於：以後的法國共產黨，是否能永遠生活在民主的空氣之中？換句話說：如果法國共產黨一旦取得政權，它是否能容評社會黨，天主敎黨等等的存在？對霍琪士敎授，還是一個謎。他要我到巴黎以後，注意這些內幕問題，有便的時候，寫一封長信告他。</p>
<p>在巴黎的三星期停留當中，靠法國情報部的介紹，看見了不少人，也聽了許多不同看法的談話。我對於這些訪問的一個槪括的印象是：第一，法國的民主政治，大異於英美。英美講「政黨政治」，兩個不同政黨的人，對內政外交的看法，總是大同小異，英美人從不願意說出他是屬於那一黨，甚至他不願說今天投票的時候，選共和黨還是民主黨？法國人就不是這樣，黨派之間鴻溝深，攻訐激烈，甚至有時候爲了達成互相攻擊的目的，可以不擇手段。挨句話說：英美人講政黨政治，黨性很淡，法國人講政黨政治，黨性很濃。英美的黨報，從來不肯承認它是黨報。法國的黨報，開門見山。再說得透澈一點，英美人講政黨政治，國重於黨。法國人講政黨政治，黨重於國。我說這話一點不『過火』，巴黎『人道報』上，每天有幾欄說理的文章，他們主張放棄民族主義，主張法國人應該丟開『從中世紀遺留下來的國家觀念。因爲……所謂國家觀念，愛護祖國，甚至法蘭西帝國，那是統治階級的工具」！</p>
<p>舊瓶裝新酒　大門加油溙</p>
<p>國家觀念反映到法國的現實問題上，便是越南事件和馬達加斯加事件。今年三月十一日，國會眾議院開會的時候，討論越南問題，共產黨的議員迦西亞，動手敺打右派議員庇爾安蒂，一時會塲秩序大亂。這次休會以前，衆議院又發生了一件大風波，原因是法國國防部發現衆議院的四名馬達加斯加議員，有通謀該島工人叛亂的證據，警察總局準備逮捕。共產黨一向反對對越南和馬達加斯加用兵，替四名議員　護，並且引用憲　：國會議員人身自由，非經全體議員同意，治安機關不能非法行事。那位共產黨議員說得激昂慷慨的時候，天主敎黨的另一議員，伸手給他一句耳光，於是全塲秩序又大亂，這是第二次。</p>
<p>以後，衆院宣佈了休會一個月，一直到最近才重開，巴黎的報紙，都把這件重將討論的糾紛，列入大標題。法國人愛看熱鬧，大部份的法國老百姓，對政治有熱情，但沒有興趣作理智的分析。傳統的『代議政治』，使他們習慣地將政權交託給政黨，讓政黨本『分權制衡』。第三共和六十五年之間，法國從紛亂到安定，到繁榮，甚至到某一個期間，幾乎領導世界，然後，到一九四〇年的『法蘭西的悲劇』。第四共和剛揭幕的時候，民族英雄戴高樂，起誓要使法蘭西『脫胎換骨』，不再走第三共和的舊路。但是，去年人民投票了新憲法，新憲法仍然是政黨政治，仍然是代議政治。法國的老百姓說：不這樣，又怎麼辦呢？戴高樂要集權，要整軍，固然有道理。但是，我們忍苦忍勞打敗了法西斯蒂，我們不能自己也來一個法西斯蒂啊？</p>
<p>這樣，第四共和依然跟第三共和沒有分別。舊瓶新酒，名稱雖都有了改變，但實際仍然是十多年前的名流和政客政治。上議院現在改稱了『法國議會』，賽恩河旁的下議院，門前重加油漆，改稱了『國民大會堂』。國民大會六百一十九個議席，共產黨最多，社會黨次之，民衆共和運動又次之，這是當今控制現政府的『鼎足三分』，再其次是赫禮歐的『急進社會黨』，以及右派的『天主敎黨』，乃至於最右的『自由共和黨』。戴高樂的『人民大結合』，因爲是新近成立的，趕不上參加今年年初的選舉。</p>
<p>陶萊士秘書　都克勞斯氏</p>
<p>我沒有機會會見法國共產黨的領袖陶萊士，戴高樂組黨計劃發表以後，陶萊士有過一次公開演講，他大駡戴高樂。說話並不見太生動，但很清楚有條理。他在莫斯科躭過很久，戰時大部份時間都在蘇俄，因此，在戴高樂執政期間，幾次想懲罰他「逃避兵役」的罪名。華萊士到巴黎以後的記者會上，我遇見陶萊士的秘書都克勞斯，那位秘書是法國共產黨派遣招待華萊士的，英文講得很漂亮。他說：陶萊士有五百萬產業工人做後盾，「祗有共產黨才是眞正爲法國工人謀幸福的」。他還說：法國現在窮，經濟枯竭，財政都收支不平衡，而仍然有四十萬大軍在海外，對越南弱小民族用兵，對馬達加斯加用兵，對北非洲戒備，一味的維繫「舊帝國」的利益。每天對海外的給養補充，消耗百萬法郎以上。吃虧的是法國勞工大衆。因此，共產然在國會堅決反對。</p>
<p>都克勞斯不願意講法國共產黨和莫斯科的關係，但是他承認：共產黨是沒有國家觀念的。對於法國的現局，他認爲各方面旣不放心共產黨出任「首相」，目前祗有讓「社會黨」過渡。他說：「社會黨號稱他們是馬克斯主義者，但決不是眞的信徒」！</p>
<h3>「人民陣綫之父」　萊翁勃倫的作風</h3>
<p>社會黨的老祖宗是萊翁勃倫。全世界『人民陣綫』之父，這位不平凡的老頭子，最近剛渡過他七十六歲的華誕。祝壽那天，全法國的名流政要都到了，祗有一個人例外，這個人便是戴高樂。據說，萊翁勃倫親自通知：不要邀請戴高樂參加，是眞是假，我們局外人無從知道。那正是斯屈拉斯堡演講以後四五天。</p>
<p>在自由主義和極權主義，資本主義和共產主義，不能調和，也未到決裂的階段，萊翁勃倫是一個必然的產物，雖然全世界的萊翁勃倫祗有一個，但萊翁勃倫的化身，却有無數個。法蘭西第三共和的歷程，已經走完，將來如果有人寫一部法蘭西第四共和的歷史，萊翁勃倫該是開宗明義的第一個人。戴高樂將軍開創了第四共和，但當戴高樂對傳統的民主政治感到厭倦的時候，聲望年資，而有政治手腕，足以和戴高樂抗衡的萊翁勃倫，攆走了戴高樂。這件公案雖不是萊翁自己做的，但却由於社會黨的公開反對戴高樂而起。萊翁勃倫自己說：『法國社會黨從來沒有嚴密組織，沒有核心作用，沒有黨團遝用。社會黨之所以能成爲黨，靠精神貫注，靠相同的政治見解』。什麽見解？他們在經濟上主張改革資本主義，高唱左傾，但是『他們是民主的，反對共產黨的爆裂手段』，因此，他們永遠是『和事老』的身份，是兩種水火思想之間的橋樑。</p>
<p>法蘭西第四共和，今天所以能成爲『四强之一』，對內對外，都靠一個橋模的運用。外交部長皮杜爾，雖不隸屬社會黨，但皮村爾的外交，正是萊翁勃倫的精神貫注。今天法國的大總統奧里沃，社會黨的元老，做過上議院議長，最近到非洲出巡去了。國務總理賴瑪迪，萊翁提拔的大將，美髯瀟洒，做事有手腕，能够多方面應付。賴瑪迪的內閣，是一個大雜凑，每次開國務會議，少不了有許多爭吵，但是賴瑪迪的『橋樑』，能够把不同的見解連貫起來。</p>
<p>華萊士抵法　匆匆地離別</p>
<p>華萊士到法國訪問的時候，社會黨政府相當表示熱烈的歡迎。華萊士下榻在凱旋門附近的『喬治第五』大飯店，原來預備作一連串公開演講，後來不知爲了什麽『底蘊』，匆匆飛回了美國？華萊士走以前，萊翁勃倫邀請他吃飯，社會黨的名流都在座。席間，華萊士講了許多對當前世界大勢的見解，對萊翁的堅守社會主義立塲，表示敬佩。據說：萊翁祇望着華萊士微笑，最後，這位七十六歲的老頭子，勸華萊士回美國以後，義一千頭鷄。萊翁說：他家裏有一個養鷄塲，總數有二千多隻，『養鷄不但利潤高，而且可以怡情養性。』華萊士見風轉舵，跟着這位賢主人，講了許多他學農科中對於養鷄的智識。第二天，華萊士就匆匆走了。</p>
<p>華萊士到紐約以後的首次記者招待會上，便提出了『法國內戰的危機』。巴黎報紙，用小標題刋載着。擁護戴高樂的『斐伽洛報』還做了挖苦華萊士的批評，說他『幼稚，一知半解』。就在那一天，赫禮歐的『急進社會黨』，通電擁護戴高樂。</p>
<p>赫禮歐回國　重振起旗鼓</p>
<p>在中文譯名中，赫禮歐和奧里沃，眞是一個大混雜。法國同業常常不能理解的笑我。我想起約翰根室在『亞洲內幕』中說很難分辨『陳誠和張羣』一樣。奧里沃是社會黨現任法國大總統。赫禮歐是前任內閣總理，急進社會黨的領袖，第一次歐戰以後，速績好幾年，是第三共和的『紅人』。納粹打到巴黎以後，赫禮歐被捕，關在柏林附近的監獄中。赫禮默在某一篇『自敍』中說：他那時天天期望盟軍的飛機，轟炸柏林，『我剩下一副不中用的老骨，縱然炸死了，也很心甘！』但是，他沒有死，蘇俄軍隊打進柏林那天，他被俄國軍用飛機裝送到了莫斯科。</p>
<p>赫禮歐在莫斯科躭了一個時期，回法國後，又重振起他的『急進社會黨』的旗鼓，並且還拉攏了不少小黨小派。組織了一個呌做『左派共和同盟』。法國人說赫禮歐的『左』派，是掛羊頭賣狗肉，說他旣不『急進』，也不『社會』，他是純粹的一個資本主義的傳統民主政黨，黨員並不多，國會六百一十九席之中，祇佔了六十六席。</p>
<p>『左派共和同盟』也參加了現內閣，當初也曾海誓山盟，擁獲國務總理賴瑪迪登台。但是因爲在內閣中地位不够重要，於其說『在朝』，毋寗稱他爲『在野』，在野的易於不滿意現狀，而戴高樂以崇高的聲望，正扯着推翻現狀的旗幟。</p>
<p>共產黨施技　打擊戴高樂</p>
<p>反對戴高樂最厲害的，當然是共產黨，以及共產黨操縱下的『勞工總會』。共產黨的機關報『人道報』用一切手段，打擊戴高樂的東山再起。說他和大軍火商人施南黛『狼狽爲奸』，說他慫恿軍人叛亂，說他在製造一九三五年的『二月六日』暴動。（註：一九三五年的二月六日，法國法西斯分子大暴動，據說，那次暴動是貝當元帥主持的。暴徒要放火焚燒國會，從國立歌劇院到康告特一帶，秩序爲之大亂，後來警察開槍，才把羣衆驅散。）甚而至於說他：當年赦免貝當元帥的死刑，也是受了賄。</p>
<p>最近一星期萊，社會黨的態度，比較老謀深算，比較老成持重。前面我說過，社會黨沒有强烈的黨的組織，沒有核心幹部，沒有黨團運用。他反對戴高樂，是反對戴之否認現行憲法，反對戴的攻擊民主政黨政治。而不是反對戴本人，以及戴的羣衆。換句話說，如果　高采州的新組織，　够遵循法國第三共和六十五年來的『憲政常軌』來競選，社會黨還是可以認承他是朋友。</p>
<p>祗有這樣『八面玲瓏』的做法，社會黨永遠可以做件國政府的『和事老』或『第三方面』，也就是永遠可以尸位法國的政府。至於社會黨做了些什麽大政績，法國人很難講得出。戴高樂下台以後的第一任社會黨國務總理古盎，現在正在吃『貪汚』的官司，罪狀是和法國的釀酒商人勾結，偸漏國家的稅收。酒。在法國是一件大宗企業，戰前法國每年出口的酒，可以換回很大一筆外匯。巴黎光復以來，聽說法國酒大部份都在『內銷』。現任國務總理賴瑪迪，正計　對酒及香水的國內銷費，徵收重稅，使能增加對外輸出的數量。</p>
<p>民衆共和黨　採取新措置</p>
<p>這次走一百八十度大轉灣的，是民衆共和運動黨，法國的第三大黨。過去一個時期，不但擁護　高樂，而且直接接受過戴的領導。在法國政黨政治的左右分野中，民衆共和運動黨屬於右翼，因爲黨的本身，有濃厚的天主敎的宗敎氣味，所以『反共』的色彩，也比較鮮明。戴高樂退出政治舞台以後，民衆共和運動的代表人是皮杜爾，皮杜爾自始至終擁護『憲政常軌』因之，戴皮之間，頗有意見上的出入。戴高樂新黨成立以後，『民衆共和運動』中有不少人投奔了戴高樂的『大結合』。前任法國內閣的軍械部長，（或稱兵工署長）米希列，以及現任法國陸軍部長的胞弟，民衆共和運動黨中的中堅份子佛羅萊脫，正式登報參加了戴高樂的新組織。</p>
<p>現實促使民衆共和運動採取新措置，他們的中央黨部，通告：凡是參加戴高樂組織的人，一　開除黨籍。這樣，走了一部份，也留下了一部份。法國的政論家觀察：　MRP，民衆共和運動，不會再有前途，因爲他已經失去了『右翼』的重要性，雖然如今它是內閣的「鼎足三分」之一。</p>
<p>無論如何，戴高樂將軍個人，這是可愛的。一個典型的法蘭西軍人，一個絕對的愛國主義者。我們局外人很難批評法國政見的誰是誰非，但戴高樂那種意見的動機，那種對第三共和末期的悲劇的警惕，就我們旁觀的人看來，是有其事實上的必要的。</p>
<p>英記者評議　法政治混亂</p>
<p>在巴黎，我遇見了倫敦泰晤士報的外交記者麥克賽漠，我們談起對於法國政治舞合面的紛亂局面，麥克賽漠對法國的聯合政府，自始至終就不存多大希望。他不能理解，爲什麽英美和法國，同樣是民主政治，政黨政治，但彼比之間，竟會相差得這麽遠？他還認爲：法國如今的紛亂的政黨政治，會使人民的「離心力」增加，更無法掌握住海外的「法蘭西帝國」！後來，我看倫敦泰晤士報，他的電訊上，也是這麽說！</p>
<h3>楊慕琦　退休前　香港的畸形繁榮</h3>
<p>— 十日香港航訊　本報特約記者程志政</p>
<p>勝利後的香港，不但已恢復了戰前的繁榮，並且比戰前更繁榮了。因爲國內的政局不能安定，經濟危機日益深刻，所以資產階級不斷的來香港，跟着人來的，便是逃避的資金，照可靠的估計，最近從國內逃避到香港的資金，每月總在一千億以上，這樣龐大的數目，直接造成國內經濟的混亂，間接助長香港的畸形繁榮。</p>
<p>儘管正當高業鬧　不景氣，香港的銀行，却是多如雨後春筍，現在華商銀行已經有了三十家，類似銀行的銀號，有一百七十一家，在籌備中的銀行銀號，更無法統計。他們主要的業務是員賣申電，換句話說，就是做資金逃避的媒介。銀行的存款，也跟着急遽的增加。游資多了，沒有正當的出路，結果祗有走到「炒」（投機）的一途。香港的金融市塲裏，隨着「炒家」的動向，時時會引起軒然大波。黃金老是在二六五元上下盤旋，許久沒有動靜了。目前「炒家」的對象，已移到西貢紙和股票方面。</p>
<p>香港的人口，已經到了一百七十萬的最高紀錄，還在不斷的增加，房荒也日趨嚴重，政府雖然明令禁收鞋金，一所普通住房的頂費，總要港幣三四千，比較高貴些的，要三五萬，不管頂費怎樣高，還是有人搶着頂！</p>
<p>中區寫字間更是供不應求，一間房通常頂費是一萬五千，電話一只另加三四千，上海來的富商巨賈，誰不想有一間寬大闊綽的寫字間，大家競出高價，頂費自然是一天天的扶搖直上。爲了應付寫字間的迫切需要，有幾家地產公司便異想天開的向天空發展，公主行原來是七層，現在再加建三層，殼行急起直追，也在大興土木，最可笑的，空中穫閣還沒有具體化，寫字間早已預定一空了。</p>
<p>最近中國　　　　一方公地，地點在皇后道　輔道的交叉口，匯豐銀行的緊隣，是中區商業地帶最理想的地段，拍賣的那天，中國銀行和何東爵士競購，結果中國銀行以三百七十四萬五千元的高價打倒了何東，做了這塊三角形地皮的主人，平均每方寸地價二百五十元，幾乎等於一兩黃金，不能不算是驚人的豪舉了。現在他們正計劃建築一所比匯豐銀行更偉大的中行大厦，建築費預算三百多萬，三十個月完工，樓下二層中行自用，全部寫字間，香港政府已預定了半數，期限五年，其餘的也由我政府駐港各機關紛紛預定，不消說早又額滿了。　港政府爲了平衡收支，決定開徵所得稅，港九各界因爲手續苛繁，不合商情，特地組織了一個反對直接稅委員會，堅決反對，他們上了港政府三次呈文，打了兩個急電到英廷呼籲，也見過港督楊慕琦當面請願，又發動全港商店蓋章，結果立法局以十三票對三票仍然通過，反稅會雖然代表了最大多數的納稅人，他們的「民意」，却沒有能得到勝利，反稅會爲了適應環境，跟着也撤銷了，據說利息，利得，薪俸稅本年九月就要開征，產業稅可能提早實行。照新規定的納稅辦法，一個獨身漢年入七千元以下的無須納稅，一個已婚而沒有十女的，年入一萬二千元以下的也不用納稅，照一般薪俸水準說，要付所得稅的，中國人恐怕祗佔很少數了</p>
<p>港督核　　任　退休，定於本月十六日乘輪返英，這幾天整個的香港，都在依依惜別的情緒中，在歷任港督之中，楊督是十分不幸的，他在戰前到任不久，太平洋戰爭便爆發了，敵人瘋在似的進攻香港，楊督的艱難困苦是可想而知的，後來香港不守，楊督也被拘禁在台灣的集中營，又歷盡了許多磨折。勝利以後，楊督返任，親手再把香港從殘破中建設起來，他和香港人民同分了甘苦，因此人民對他，也格外的愛戴。新港督葛利亨要到七月才能到任，在過渡的兩月中間將由輔政司麥高道代理。</p>
<p>國內的混亂持續下去，香港的繁榮却不斷的在滋長着。</p>

<h3>史坦培克的新作</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>美國名小說家史坦培克（John　Steinbeck）對於新聞記者的訪問回答得很幽默：「你高興對於我怎麽寫就怎麽寫，我可記不得我自已會做過些什麼事，或者曾寫過多少作品。本來傳記的本身就有一半是小說。」但是我們還是要先介紹他的略傳。</p>
<p>他在一九〇二年二月廿七日生於加尼福尼亞州蒙特里縣（Monterey　County）的沙里那士鄉（Salinas）。他的母親是敎員，他的父親是鄉裏的公務員。他最初的訊憶就是文字和人民，年靑的時候，他就想用前者來服務後者。一九一九年他在校刋上寫稿，還做級長，籃球打得很好。一九一九到一九二五年他在史丹福大學讀書，選他自己愛讀的書，因此離校後不曾得到學位。他坐運貨的船到紐約去，在滿哈坦（Manhattan）做報告員和泥水匠。回到加州後纔專心從事寫作。他在塞拉斯（Sierras）住了一個時期。他曾經窮過一陣，甚至連狗都養不起。他最初三本書是「金杯」（Cup　of　Gold）「天堂牧塲」（The　Pastures　of　Heavens）和「給不知名的神」（To　a　God　Unknown）。這三本書的總銷數還不到三千本國。一九三五年「彎曲的淺灘」（Tortilla　Flat）使他得到成功。一九三七年「鼠與人（Of　Mice　and　Men）更增加了他的聲譽。此後他又出版「紅駒」（The　Red　Pony　1937），「長谷」（The　Long　Valley,1938）「憤怒的葡萄」（The　Grapes　Of　Wrath,1939）「被志却的鄉村」（The　Forgotten　Village　1941）「月亮下去了」（The　Moon　Is　Down　1942）「轟炸遠了」（Bombs　Away,1942）以及「罐頭食物廠的「排屋」（Cannery　Row,1945）。一九四三年他曾歐洲去爲「紐約先驅論壇」（New　York　Herald　Tribune）這刋物做通信員。他是一個純粹的作家。他批評自己甚爲嚴格，從來不曾布望能有大的成功。他怕出名以後，便不肯努力求技術上的進步了。他頗驚異於批評家看不出他小說的含義。他未刋的作品比他出版的作品還要多；他繼續尋求新的計畫。最近新出的「不規則的汽車」（Wayward　Bus,1947）便是八年來最長的長篇小說。</p>
<p>這本新著不能與自己以前任何小說相比較。它沒有「天堂牧塲」和「彎曲的淺灘」那樣的柔和，也沒有「鼠與人」那樣兇猛的默性，又不是像「憤怒的葡萄」那樣悲苦的社會鬥爭的故事。你不能說他這一本書比他以前的這一本好或那一本壞。每一頁都顯出史坦培克特殊的作風。它本身是站得住的。他的作品像馬克吐溫的一樣，二十年來一直發展着他的天才。</p>
<p>過去史坦培克所寫，多爲蒙特里縣河邊的罐頭食物廠，醫生，碼頭工人以及賣淫婦。但現在他的背景却是餐室和汽車行，在高大的樹林之間。汽車行主人名呌裘安（Juan　Chicoy），他與他的妻子同住。這本書史坦培克久巳想出版，他所創造的九個人物也在胸中蘊藏了很久。</p>
<p>他所想寫的就是自然純樸的人。這題材會經迷住了不少作家。自從盧騷起就想說明：一個人或全家被拋到荒島上，高貴的獸性的人做了帝王，其間也有愛的糾紛，係巴蕾所寫的「可敬的克萊登」一樣。或者係歷險的泰山。裘安是愛爾蘭和墨西哥的混合種，他也是有獸性的，但見了他所喜歡的女人，默性却收歛起來。他是個自由而不受任何種束縛的人，可以任何時離開那愛他愛到忌妒的人，或者離開他所苦心經營的事業，只穿一件襯衫，再去開始他的漂泊生涯。自然而又自由的人是常在史坦培克的作品中發現的，從「鼠與人」中的獸性直到「彎曲的淺灘」中溫和純樸的農民。裘安是壯健。熱情的人，深明機械，對於人類摯愛而且了解，特別是遇見女人，好像蜜蜂遇見花蜜一樣。他的妻子曉得他的性格，她緊張地生活着，恐怕會要失去他；倘若眞的一旦實現，那她就只好酗酒解愁了。</p>
<p>兩個人與他們住在一起：一個是女郞，瘋狂一般地愛看克拉克。蓋博的電影，她在餐室裏侍候主顧；還有一個年靑的機師，名呌平潑斯。四位客人到來，在暴風雨中等待裘安用舊車子把他們載到西部高原去。其中有一個誠實的女子，富於誘惑性，她的日子是在被人詛咒中過去的，所以她不能找到職業，人家只願强姦他，都不願娶她，她只好用她的裸體給尊貴的商人看，藉此來賺點錢。演完以後便是她喝大杯的紅酒。還有一個誠實的女子，健康而且貪吝。她有時希望她的父母忽然死掉。富翁畢加夫婦正與他們的女兒到墨西哥去，這樣他們回家的時候，好誇耀他們的經歷。新聞記者將向他們索取照片，婦女會將稱他的妻子爲女性之光。這一對卑微的人在小說中是寫得很成功的。畢加是齪齪，　大，虛偽的人。還有一位顧客是說笑話的。</p>
<p>他們都在等着車開行。裘安知道他的妻子腦筋有病，因爲他瞟過畢加的女兒。他知道他回家時，他的妻子又要酗酒了。在將到時，橋斷了，裘安把車子冒險開到不曾走過的危險的山路上去。畢加的女兒果然愛上了這位原始人，畢加愛上了那個他曾經見她裸體過的女子，酒流下她的大腿，像紫血一樣。</p>
<h3>山水扇面</h3>
<p>— 朱梅邨</p>
<h3>春秋</h3>
<p>— 斯民</p>
<p>春</p>
<p>春，她自己來了。</p>
<p>她踏過這裏的土地，土地醒了過來；她吻了下花唇，映山紅開遍了山野；她撫摸着百靈島的毛羽，招來了燕子；她在溪畔吹了一下口哨，奏起了水波的樂隊；她，輕紗挨過的林樹，田畝……都活了起來。</p>
<p>她，又被半推半拉地請進了城市。</p>
<p>對春天有着敏感的女人，都萬紫千紅地開遍在街頭，招展的花校，誘來了成羣的蜜蜂。</p>
<p>而且，你瞧，吉普車載來了城外的桃花，街頭揚起了瀰天的塵灰。</p>
<p>春，就是這樣麽？這就是春麼？</p>
<p>我懷疑，怎麼春天的脚步，踏不進那個水深火熱的地域？她怎麼不去吻一吻那哭喪着的流淚的臉頰？她那仁慈的手，怎麼不去撫摸一下那投河自盡的女人呢？她，對於苦難的一羣，連一聲笑也是吝嗇的啊！</p>
<p>春，就是這樣麼？這就是春麽？</p>
<p>我想，春，那人類的眞正的春，該還很遙逮，因爲冰雪正重重地壓在我們的身上！</p>
<p>秋</p>
<p>一片紅葉，輕輕地從秋風的翅膀上滑了下來，一些多感的人們，心悸動了，悲哀像暮藹一般地升起。</p>
<p>這樣的生活是古典的，像綺麗的夢一樣，給予我們太多的想像。</p>
<p>但，今天秋依然那樣豐富和壯健，一絲也沒有改變。</p>
<p>這是個我們渴慕的季節，我們要以最興奮的心，最激動的手來迎接她，我們的歡笑，洋溢在望不盡的田畝了。</p>
<p>秋，莊稼成熟了。穗子像懷孕的少婦一樣，羞澀地低着頭。風，輕輕地挨過時，田畝裏翻着金色的浪頭啊！</p>
<p>農塲上，打殼的聲音，淸脆地揚起，挾着咯咯的女人的笑聲</p>
<p>跑過農家的門口時，新米飯的噴香，老遠老遠就撲到你的鼻管裏來了。</p>
<p>土地是最忠實的，支付出去的勞力，得到應得的利息了，這不是最理想，最快活的生活麽？</p>
<p>但地主已持着秤，等在門口了呢！</p>
<p>莊稼漢的夢剛剛做得滾圓的時候，却又輕輕地破碎了……</p>
<p>會有這麽一天嗎？他們的夢將永遠不會破碎啊！</p>
<h3>汪亞塵畫展</h3>
<p>— 華林</p>
<p>齊白石有詞「西江月」贈名畫家汪亞塵：『雲隱樓頭高士，身離虎尾春冰』之句。雲隱即注亞塵的別號。抗戰八年，注氏閉門作畫，隱居簡出，猶如達塵面壁，故其藝大進。凡花鳥蟲魚，非經其觀察，非經其體會，則不願落筆。蓋臨要雖有佳作，終非藝事之上乘。汪氏創作已自成風格。</p>
<p>回憶民九年，汪氏留日返國，當時已爲藝壇所推崇，頗負盛名。三十年來，潛心研究，絕未中斷。民十九由法歸國，主持新華藝專，以歐洲各國現代藝術之趨向，遝用在國畫上，一天天努力，一年年進步，藝事與時俱進；他的聲望也愈高。</p>
<p>汪氏技巧純熟，下筆天成，不假人工設施，足見其恒久之鍛鍊，絕非偶然有以致之。天才要有長久的努力，心地寗靜，不慕榮利，舍工作無事業，舍繪畫無世界！藝人天地，所謂微　一世界，世界一微塵，此中三昧，不足與外人道也</p>
<h3>山城情味</h3>
<p>— 閻哲吾</p>
<p>龍的娛樂</p>
<p>在山城住了多年，每逢端陽，我愛新嘉陵江邊的龍舟競渡；那些生命力充實的「永鬼」，著着紅，黃，緣，白，黑彩色的衣衫，坐在狹長的龍舟上奮力地齊一地划槳，更依單一的鑼鼓節奏，龍頭舞動着指揮令旗，急速地在滾滾江流上飄進。那吊尾者的時起的落，赤裸裸地運動，顯得勇壯而冒險。山城兩岸佇觀的人燃放着爆竹助威，水上司令台前領獎，那種活躍與樂趣却是値得珍奇的。</p>
<p>同樣地，也是「龍」，舉行在新年燈節裏，那呌做「要龍燈」。要龍的，一個個頭上紮塊紅布，赤着膊，在隆冬裏舞動着龍燈。舞的本身與江市的無甚分別，但有一種較刺激的習俗，名呌「燒龍」，却是別處所難見的。</p>
<p>什麼呌「燒龍」？就是用一種特製的火炮發放火花，直向要能者肉體上射去。被火花燒到的人們，不許逃避，只許在原地舉身躍動，抵抗火花；皮肉雖然痛楚，却要咬牙忍受，至火花燒射完了爲止。據說有一種迷信，這樣可以燒去晦氣。事實上這實在是一種原始而又野蠻的習俗之遺留。</p>
<p>再有一種「潑水龍」也是相當兇惡的。就是遇到天孕祈雨，便以柳枝等紮成一龍，彷「要龍」方法滿街遊行；商舖子貯水相待。龍來了，以面盆沓水，一盆盆沒頭沒險地向要龍者的身上潑去。潑得要龍者不許逃避，挺而受難；有時胸前，而部被潑得發赤。這大槪表示誠心，所以感勁天地。此外，還有一種「孝龍」，在出喪時作爲喪儀的，純用白紙糊成，「環」環地與玩龍形式無異，惟不要弄而已。</p>
<p>耗子世界</p>
<p>耗子到處有，四川特別多。耗子好打洞，四川耗子還能撥土，泅水，過陰溝。</p>
<p>在山城，夜深人靜，耗子出來覓食，可以成羣結隊地「過街」；也有不幸地被車輪輾死在街心的。腸肚崩裂的死耗子隨處可以看到。但耗子「鼠竊」的本領也特別大，除了新屋子而外，沒有一家屋子沒有他光顧的。他的繁殖率非當之大，有人說，倘無人撲滅，重慶很快可以成爲耗子世界。</p>
<p>山城的耗子大而肥，胆也大，能　小孩的臉和脚，也能咬懸在屋內的東西，由一根繫着的繩索俯衝下去；但有時也隨食物一齊斷落塵埃驚慌而去的。普通紙張，木器，他統啃！皮鞋他也吃；衣服口袋裏藏有花生米之類，他可以咬破口袋偸食它；用漿糊糊的東西，他也能專食那有漿糊的所在。</p>
<p>不過耗子畢竟狡猾，捕耗子的藥拌在飯裏，有時他能嗅得出，竟然不吃，但從此他可以不再來。</p>
<p>因爲耗子多，貓很少，在山城，賣貓的是放在籠子裏的；而且養貓的往往用繩子繫住，到夜晚才放出來。不過家中有個貓，的確好，他不受賄，不徇情，遇到耗子必定捉了「盤」，「盤」死了爲止。很多人認貓爲柔順，無情，善變的玩物，我以爲鼠竊橫行的歲月，貓仍舊還有牠的用途，否則一座山城，早成爲耗子世界了！</p>
<p>鳴鑼告白</p>
<p>初到山城，莫明其妙，常常見到街上有人打着鑼，然後圍上去一圈人們，聽他口中唸唸有詞，文乎文乎的，初以爲是要猴戲，或者是街頭唱戲說書者流；後來才知道這呌做「鳴鑼告白」，是一種「活告示」。是不識字人多的農民社曾遺留下的一種推行政令的辦法。</p>
<p>「鳴鑼告白」大槪是「地保」之類人物的職守，如今改由鄉公所保甲附庸人物辦理，但也有以縣政府更夫兼任的。</p>
<p>鳴鑼者先取到告示，由主管人員告訴他告示的內容，有時還須諗唸熟內容，敎好了，出發街頭巷尾，敲鑼聚衆，老百姓也有了習慣，鑼一敲，羣衆便圍集上來，聽他口誦內容，遇有不懂的還可再問仔細。告白完了，加敲三鑼，表示「畢」的意思。</p>
<p>這種告示方式，非常原始，簡單，而有趣，却是値得推行與保留的一種施政小技，可惜別省還很少看到。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　510</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「明白了，小姐！」鶴見的橫勁，也許是給挑戰式的「手槍」，「試騐」等字樣觸動了，於是那被虛僞禮貌抑制着的性，活潑起來了。他一面答應着，一面一回手就從腰下「禿」地把那柄德式二十蕾扯了出來，站在室中心，一丈多見方空處的地毯上，好像要表演什麼技能似的：</p>
<p>『這裏面……子彈已經上了膛，保險可還關着，您請看！』鶴見等候那女子表示，再決定行止。</p>
<p>「好極　！」對方搖搖頭，虛擬作勢，伸出一豐　　的小手，憑空一推，「手　還是　拿着，不必給我……您只一舉槍，眞打也行，作樣子子演也行，隨便！我　試試　，能不能空手　下來！……」說着，對　見四對及　　，掃射了一眼。</p>
<p>「　！」　見　可以　有些明白了：　　然回　　前天和北　，　小　　衷演「　　　　」的一　。　　　很　　了，　一會，好　在　　什　　的，　則哈哈大笑着！「　　　　」　的　　　？</p>
<p>「　沒有關　！」　　　一　　　　。</p>
<p>「很好，很好！」鶴見也使出他素常並無涵義的老調調來了。守一是否有這麼一位妹妹，他可沒有打聽過。可是他記得在守一面前，一再提到過小老虎和耀羣的技能和成績。小老虎的空手奪槍，也是報告的得意節目之一。這個報告，大槪由守一給廣佈了整個百忍莊，所以激動了這位小姐，也來試試身手，示威一回。</p>
<p>「來罷！…您只一舉槍，我就動手！」她下命令了。</p>
<p>「我把子彈退下來罷。「鶴見又有些」娘娘腔」了；也許給對方一個最後試探。</p>
<p>「不必…連保險都可以擰開！」她表示滿不在乎。</p>
<p>「嗒，」的一聲響，鶴見果眞把保險機開了。一面一攔姿式，很迅疾地一抬手習，　望「即」　一聲，子彈就要飛出…　在這一當，只見那位小姐，早從沙發裏一　而　：　　　　，左右只先了兩下，還在　　　去目標，跟着　　的當口，人　已經不見、　見倏地轉身，要找尋日標的那一霎，只覺自己舉槍的小臂，一陣疲麻，握槍的手，已經空了，手槍已經不知去向。</p>
<p>「這兒！」聲音還是那們脆而且甜，還帶着一些嘻嘻哈哈意味。</p>
<p>鶴見使出身段，連轉兩轉，也够敏捷的了，却只聽見說話的聲音，却並看不見人影。</p>
<p>鶴見也練過柔術劍道，身手也十分靈活，功夫在一般武士道水準之上，這時確也拿出了他的眞實本領。只見他在這方丈一塊空地上，左掠右跳，前抑後騰，却是始終找不到對方人影。</p>
<p>「這兒！」她連聲逗着。</p>
<p>一連這們轉了幾轉，仍然看不見對方人影，鶴見動了拗性，有些發急了，知道這們轉一天，也是無益，於是併足氣力，蓄滿勢子，猛地往前一躍，約莫五六尺遠近，脚尖剛一點地，驀地又騰起身子一個倒投葱，在半空裏打了一個翻身，那身子在空間裏劃出了一條圓拱綫似的，重又回到剛才起跳的地點，落下脚來，穩穩站定。這個身法，在柔道較量時，很少應用。然練習到第五段，非得學會這一手不可。因偶然遇到勁敵，被摔了出去，有時可能在一丈開外，落在地下，講究雙足站定，紋風不動，才是好手。</p>
<h3>徵妓作樂是巨竊</h3>
<p>— 氣樓</p>
<p>四個胸佩徽章，舉止闊紳的客人，在旅館內開了房間，徵妓作樂，不料樂極生悲，警察局派了人員前來，加以逮捕：原來這四位關客乃是南京的巨竊，因軍警通緝嚴厲，潛逃來滬。他們在滬一面作業，一面仍幹着盜竊的勾當，却不知警局方面已經探悉了他們的行踪，不費吹灰之力就將他們拘獲了。</p>
<p>這樣的新聞，在上海可說是司空見慣，已經不是一人咬狗」而是應該國於「狗咬人」之類裏去了。然而新聞總是新聞，而且自有其新聞的便値。</p>
<p>巨竊徵妓作樂，這件事換二句話來說，就是用不正當的手段弄了錢來去尋歡作樂。這些人有時候竟有在尋歡作樂以後，把歡塲的女兒們當作了盜竊的對象。不久以前就曾有過闊綽舞客刧奪舞女首飾的事。他們爲了要窮奢極欲而竊盜，同時也因爲儘來之物，更能揮金如土地拚命享樂。享樂以後更不能不竊盜。這就走到一個惡性的循環裏面去了，古人說「勃入勃出」，其實「勃出」的人，往往是因爲有了「勃人」，而「勃出」以後，更使他們不能不尋求「勃入」。</p>
<p>在這個舉國皆陷於貧困之中的時候，有些人以極頂闊綽的姿態出現，倘然有人將這種闊綽的根源發掘出來，大概會使那些闊客臉紅。正如那幾個徵妓作樂的旅客一樣。自然這些歡塲之中的闊客，未必都是巨竊或者江洋大盜。然而他們也許是鼠竊狗偸。未必是　　前緒的小東西。他們却用同樣不可見人的手段，偸取了別人袋裘的錢財。他們未必直接刼奪歡塲女兒的金銀飾物，然而憑藉了不可見人的手段，他們却偸了她們，搶了她們。甚至搶得她們走頭無路而投身歡塲的也是他們，是他們這些極頂闊綽的闊客。當一個舞女爲了客人對她揮金如土而感恩知己的時候，她幾曾想到對方是一個鼠竊狗偸，而且被竊被偸的就是她自己？</p>
<p>倘然她這樣想，她一定會　息像前述四巨竊那樣落網的實在太少了。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>林肯的婚姻</h3>
<p>— 管中窺</p>
<p>黑奴解放的救星林肯先生，有悲天憫人的心腸，和偉大的仁恕，他與梅麗泰的婚姻，却是恒久的痛苦和折磨。</p>
<p>他和他的夫人，在性格上，志願上，及所受的敎育上，處處都現得南轅北轍。從他給薩孟爾馬歇爾的信上，可以看得出他內心底矛盾：「此間無新聞，要推我的婚姻，這件事在我一方面，眞覺得異乎尋常的可驚可愕。」</p>
<p>當其定婚不久，他寫了封信，說明他愛梅麗泰尚未到結　的程度，託他的老友李比德轉交給她，而李比德先生把這封信拋到燼裏，問他爲甚麽不自己去說，林肯終於鼓着勇氣去了，告訴她這個消息，引起她痛哭流涕，心腸柔軟的林肯先生，不忍見女人在他面前哭泣，於是，擁着她一吻，又向她告罪，這樣他們便結合了。</p>
<p>她婚後的生活過得不很甜蜜，有一天早上，他與夫人同進早餐，不知說了甚麽話，使她大爲光火，檢起一杯熱咖啡，劈頭向林肯先生臉上擲去，在許多同寓客莫名其妙的眼光下，他不回答，也不責駡她，旗到主婦用手巾給他拂拭，他仍一言不發。這種不愉快的生活達二十三年之久，他總是逆來順受，從不懷怨，也不向人提起她的壞脾氣，他眞有耶穌樣的寬恕心腸。</p>
<h3>會考和總考</h3>
<p>— 沈戡</p>
<p>「十年窗下苦，學成　已霜」。這是古代科舉制度下的犧牲者。明朝以八股取士，因爲當時天子深恐人民叛己，於是用這種刻版式文章，以消磨其英雄豪傑之志氣。淸代沿亦而用習之，我國遂有東亞病夫的稱呼，今日我國敎育制度中之會考和總考，雖與昔日求科有別，然頗値加以研究，鄙人於民國卅二年畢業於復旦大學，歷經會考和總考，今日察其結果，實未發覺如何有益之處，大凡考試名列前茅者，其前途每難樂觀。蓋其應付者試過度，致力腦力消耗，學業以後，思想　鈍，對於所學不能轉運靈活。且身體受傷，形成未老　　狀態　比不過列舉此二種考試之後果根據事實作歸納論之。</p>
<p>茲再就理論言之，會考爲高中學黨時所瘵行之　　，其目的在提高敎育　　，取中國一。然各學　均有其屬　之處，各具專長本不　　，　使其爲方爲到，似有望乎道理之　。</p>
<p>至於總考，爲大學畢業時所舉行之考試，考諸世界各國，實未有此種或類似此種之敎育制度，查大學槪爲專科，學生亦以各擇其所好而發展自己所長爲本。四年所學，至Senior第四年，例應著作畢業論文，此論文即將四年所學之精華凝結Condense而成者，亦可作爲歷來學問之結晶。此時學問在思想中業經融會貫通矣。今畢業總考，舉四年所學。分門別類加以試騐，是無異將製成品，再拆散之。其悖理之處未有甚於此者。鄙人所學無術，僅陳管見，敬希學界先進賜予指正。</p>
<h3>朋友的用處</h3>
<p>— 果</p>
<p>某甲外出，一夜未歸。她的妻子打了五個電報給她丈夫的五個朋友，問他是否宿在他們家裏。</p>
<p>不多一會丈夫回來了。跟着電報局來了五個回電。都說：不錯，他在今晚宿在我處。</p>
<h3>歡喜佛</h3>
<p>— 李朴園</p>
<p>佛敎密宗造像，最惹人注意，也最惹人議論的，大約要數歡喜佛了。</p>
<p>這些造像，作者從前在北平雍和宮是看到過的，這次在塔兒寺又許細觀摩過。誠然，這些造像，全部都是奇怪到不可思議的；有些倒還好，有些，不單主尊是幾頭，幾面，好幾十對手，懷裏抱着，或是脚下踝着「類似女人」的人物；而且，簡直把生殖器都露出來，這，在性道德觀念不甚相同的草地人看上去也許沒甚麽，在我們這些把性交看得非常神密，甚至敎坐理學的先生們都不「好意思」拿出生殖器官來，敎中原人看起來，豈不是太豈有此理了嗎？無怪有人猜測：北平的雍和宮，是因爲怕幼年登極的皇帝不懂得性交，老王爺怕他絕後，又不好意思「敎」給他，只好造了這些表演性交的神像、明爲神佛，暗示性交，這是因爲草地上的人不知道人類是怎　生存起來的，不得不用這些佛像，一面表示人生的所以，一面表示此事的茲嚴……等等。</p>
<p>在塔兒寺的大金瓦寺左首，正當大經堂同大金瓦寺的夾道中間，坐東朝西，有一座「護法殿」，門口兒用柵欄門欄着，彷彿不大願意給一般人進去似的，而香火整日不絕，這，就是供養全體歡喜佛的一個大殿；作者，一則因爲是主席招待的客卿，再則也同喇嘛們攪得還好，所以，一而再，再而三地走進去觀摩了，而一次比一次，更使我明白從前關於歡喜佛的傳說的荒唐。</p>
<p>這個殿，在形式上很像內地佛寺的羅漢堂，所有的一組一組的歡嘉佛，都是密密層層地排列着的，一般的講已經够擠了，而，每一組，主尊已經是好幾個頭臉，好幾十隻手臂的了，再加上懷裏多半抱着一個，脚下踝着多半不止一個，所以愈加感覺擁擠不堪；這還不算，它們還是一組佔一個　，龕上還有　，門楣上也有　——所以，敎觀光神佛的人，時時有一種感覺，很怕一不小心，前後上下那些頭·臉·手·脚·生殖器……就會碰到臉上似的！</p>
<p>頭一次我也有些怕日子一久，習慣了，也逐漸明白了這些「護法」們並沒有同我惡作劇的意思。而且，參照後來所看的「跳神」，我知道：它們，原來都是革地上的精靈。妖怪。或是我佛在草地上學佛的時候，從心理上產生的精靈同妖怪，它們是想同我佛作對的，它們也曾以它們的魔力來問我佛鬥過法，但是，邪不敵正，漸漸地，它們的魔力勝不過我佛的法力，最後他們是一個個被我佛的各種法身征服了；於是，它們以擁抱，性交，表示它們的獻媚，以每一組歡喜佛都有的，那被抱的人以一手托起滿盛鮮血的頭蓋骨，獻給我佛的法身（主尊），表示它們所貢獻的歡喜，那些被抱的人，雖然「類似女人」，却不一定是女人，它們的原形也許是被跺在脚下的獸，而它們的變相大約是那被抱的人身！至於主尊的頭，那是思想的象徵；臉，是情緒的象徵；手臂，是威力；手裏的束西，則是法寳的象徵！</p>
<p>每一組，是一個我佛征服邪念的戲劇故事，整體的意義是「護法」。</p>
<p>但，它們是多精微特殊的一種雕塑藝術啊！</p>
<h3>孩子之累</h3>
<p>— 丁小</p>
<p>「結婚以後，容得下幸福的時間祗有一年」！一個朋友看到案頭一張喜柬以後，這樣慨乎言之的說。他，是一年前結婚的，因爲，一年後，他就有了孩子。爲了孩子的緣故，他的要子不得不離開工作，於是不得不以從前的一半收入來應付增加了一半的支出。也因此，他們倆不能再一起進電影院，也由此，不再聽到他們倆月夜的唱和，生活遽然的單調和拙劣了下來。</p>
<p>所以，當他看到一張喜柬後，他要說結婚後容得下幸福的時間祗有一年了。</p>
<p>似乎從前如此，當今也一樣，除非能够巧奪豪取，一般人向來就苦於家室之累，感到這是一付沉重的擔子。雖然有人在唱獨身主義，可是似乎一個人是不能不有家室的。而且在現代，許多人也並不怕結婚，二個人的合作究竟比一個人單獨的生活好。假定彼此同具能力，同有職業，那末，結婚後的幸福並不會被經濟上的困厄所損毀了去的。</p>
<p>所以，問題就在孩子。</p>
<p>前幾天，去另一位朋友家裏，他有金條頂來的一幢房子，他有收入尚佳的一個職位，婚後已多年，有了五個孩子。整天，他被孩子所打擾着。當我去看他時，他眞爲孩子的呌鬧所苦惱，當然，他也曾爲孩子的一切如敎育，衣食等問題所苦惱過的。「看到我，他就說：「如果你結婚，你千萬別生孩子。」這是他前幾次力促我結婚後的一次重要的補充。</p>
<p>因此，今天與其說家室之累，母寗說孩子之累會更具體更恰當些。沒有孩子，一個小家庭大致還能保持其良好的景况，一有孩子，那情形就會慘淡下來了。這也是一個嚴重的社會間題，在今天，托兒所旣不普及，即使有也在並不良好或商業化的情形下，這累會累得一個小家庭不能動彈，會累得我們小家庭中男女主人翁痛苦萬分。然而，結婚不育，猶如緣木求魚，這怪不得市上避孕的藥物和書籍要銷售得這樣廣且泛了。</p>
<p>今天，就有這樣的現象，不少及齡的靑年男女，爲了畏懼生活，尤其畏懼有了孩子以後的生活，而因此遲遲不能結婚和不敢結婚。可是終不能永遠造成着一個獨身的時代，和沒有孩子的時代。也終不能讓靑年永建槪嘆結婚以後容得下幸福的時間祗有一年吧。</p>
<p>那末，最重要的還是使滬個社會完滿得不令人感到孩子之累才好。不過假如讓孩子的一切仍成爲個別的家庭——父親和母親的責任，如果仍以孩子爲私產，不認爲是大社會的新生的一代，誰都會對未來的快樂家庭感到懷疑的吧。</p>

<h3>指斥人的方法</h3>
<p>— 王耐之</p>
<p>和朋友閒談，談到最近示寂的震華與福海上人，以壯年靑年而夭折不勝悼惜，覺得這樣傑出的僧才，前程無限，假使能多活十年廿年的話，其成就必更有莊嚴璀璨，照耀千古者；然而徒以平日不知攝生之故，或構痼疾或染天花，遽致不起，使弘法前途　算之損害，令人悲怛曷秘，所以爲法。實是僧伽們應切切注意的事。</p>
<p>連帶我們談起××法師，師也是一位智　卓越前靑年夭折的僧伽，這是二十年以前的事了。據聞他回國不久，受了一位師長的　　，氣忿不過，因而抑鬱成病以致於死的；　難的人，說業年少　落，（死時年　二十有四）連　些些氣　常受不住，當然不是大器了。其實少年人　不氣　。恰　又　樓的　不　反來　　受氣惱的沒器量，這豈得爲平？常聽人說，度人要有善巧方便，勸人爲善要懂得循循善誘的門檻，要糾正人家的錯誤，切忌直截指出。我過去常犯這個錯誤，得罪了許多人，貢了謝多事，還自以爲間心無愧。動機是要人向善，要人革去　妄之見，現在想來眞是胡鬧。我何曾有半點了解他人見解之心，我何曾對人有半點慈悲憐憫之情？自以爲知見正，見識比他高，　然有敎誨人的資格，於是聽了他人　　（？）之論，覺得這裏錯，那裏錯，錯誤斑斑，全盤都是，於是忍不住了，要行善心了，　　他一下，　　一下，目以爲　　　對方面子，還把　　一　壓　之氣，不。——一股正義　，　情　　，　　對方　　然　要實他　子不可敎，我　要　　　，不　　刺呵斥縱如何　　，在　　　　學得十分難堪，更無况年少愛强的人。</p>

<h3>Valiant National Army Troops Arrive in Jilin; Changchun Announces Martial Law, Hearts Are at Peace; Situation in Meihekou, Liaodong Turns Amicable</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 16th] Changchun has begun deploying city defenses. Martial law was announced starting last night from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM, but the general public's hearts are quite at peace. There is no trace of Communist troops within 20 li around Nongan. Passenger buses between Changchun and Nongan have been temporarily suspended due to a shortage of vehicles.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 16th] Huai'de saw fierce fighting all day yesterday. The Communist First Division moved from the Nongan area to reinforce. The Communist forces have approximately 20,000 troops in four divisions. National Army attacking units are detouring forward from the northwest of Changchun to cut off their retreat route first. A battle to encircle and annihilate the Communist forces may unfold in the vicinity of Huai'de within 50 hours.</p>

This location is only 50 li away from the Communist advanced headquarters in Hala Hai, which commands the invading Communist forces. The Communist forces are detouring south along the Changtao Road. The majority of the forces attacking Huai'de are currently moving along the line of Sima Jiazi, Bajilei, and Shaoguodian. The section of Changtao Road along Nongan and Changchun is calm and uneventful.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The battle in the suburbs of Jilin City will see a major turning point in the next day or two. Valiant National Army troops heading north along the Jilin-Shenyang Road arrived in Jilin on the 15th. A portion of them has dispersed to various strongholds around Jilin. It is generally expected that a large-scale battle will unfold within a few hours.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 15th] Jilin Province Chairman Liang Huasheng broadcast to the citizens, first reporting that the Communist troops who infiltrated Xinjilin, the northern suburb of Jilin City, had been largely annihilated by the National Army and driven out. He then explained the strength of the National Army and assured that the defense of Jilin City was absolutely secure. He personally vowed to protect Jilin and Fengman with his life.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 16th] According to intelligence obtained by the military, the Communist forces attacking Jilin are commanded by Cao Lihuai. On the 13th, he convened a meeting of officers at the regimental level and above in Gangyao, deciding on the attack plan, dividing it into three routes of attack: (1) The main force would directly attack Jilin from Jiangmifeng; (2) The right wing would depart from Jiaofa, attack Xiaofengman, and then cross the river via Xindian to cut off the Jilin-Huadian railway on the Panji Line; (3) The left wing would advance south from Baiqitun, cross the river to occupy Tumenling, and encircle Jilin. The Communist main force attack has already suffered a serious blow from the National Army. After suffering heavy losses, the Communist forces have been driven back to the area north of Datun, but their attempt to attack on both wings remains a significant concern.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 16th] The Communist forces are showing signs of attacking Wulajie and Qita again. Yesterday, 2,500 Mongolian cavalrymen infiltrated Yangmulizi, 20 li southwest of Gangyao. Over 5,000 infantrymen also infiltrated Gaojia, north of Wulajie. The National Army is on high alert.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 16th] The Communist offensive is currently unfolding along a 70-kilometer line between Meihekou and Ying'emen, where the northern section of the Liaodong Panhai Road connects with the Pingmei Road. Highland 68, approximately 5 kilometers south of Meihekou, has already been captured by the Communist forces. Furthermore, Toudaogang, Erdaogang, and Sandaogang in the northwest are all occupied by Communist forces. Moreover, approximately 5,000 Communist troops captured Shancheng on the Shenhai Road at 8:00 AM on the 14th. As a result, the Shenhai Road, which had just been cleared, is only open to Qingyuan.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 16th] Liao Yaoxiang, Commander of the Sixth Pacification Zone, arrived in Qingyuan from Fushun at 3:00 PM on the 15th to take command. The Shenhai and Zhongchang railways are busy with military transport. The National Army can regain the upper hand.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 16th] Zheng Dongguo and Sun Liren returned to Shenyang together by plane at 11:30 AM on the 16th and will command military operations in Panjin. (2) Military authorities stated that the Communist offensive steps were quite chaotic and can be stabilized in the short term.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 16th] The tense mood felt here in the past 100 hours due to the Communist invasion has eased starting on the 16th. Since the 15th, large numbers of National Army troops have continued to head north, gathering along the Zhongchang Road and Changshen Railway. The Communist forces, who were besieging Jilin and Nongan and repeatedly failed to capture the cities, have now stopped advancing. Their confidence in seizing the cities has been completely lost. Meihekou, which was once in a state of emergency on the evening of the 15th, is also trending towards calm as the situation in the Jilin-Changchun area improves. The Communist forces in that area retreated towards the southeast and northeast of Meihekou on the morning of the 16th.</p>

<p>[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 15th] The situation in Yuci and Taigu, east and south of Taiyuan, has stabilized. However, the Communist forces in the northwest are showing signs of another large-scale southward advance. The Communist forces crossing from eastern Shaanxi and merging with the 120th Division entrenched in Kelan and other counties, after regrouping, moved towards Fangshan via Juqian, totaling two divisions and six brigades, approximately 60,000 troops. The command headquarters is currently located in Machang Town, east of Fangshan City. Mao, Zhu, Xu, and Zhou are living together in Wuhe, and new actions are certainly being planned.

<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 16th] The Communist forces surrounding Yuncheng attacked the surrounding strongholds again at midnight on the 15th. The National Army responded calmly, causing heavy casualties to the Communist forces, who ultimately failed and were driven back at dawn. There is no change in the battle situation in Anyi and Xiaxian. The National Army continues to hold firm.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 16th] Besides a portion of the Communist forces in Hebei entering Shanxi, the remaining Communist forces and the Fourth Column are currently retreating to Anguo and Wangdu, Tangxian. Two brigades are based in Xinle, and another force of 8,000 is being transferred from Jingxing north to Pingshan.

<h3>Minister of Agriculture Zuo Shunsheng Assumes Office; Says He Will Still Maintain the Spirit of Working Together to Overcome National Difficulties and Develop Agriculture to Reduce the People's Suffering</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th] The newly appointed Minister of Agriculture, Zuo Shunsheng, arrived at the ministry at 9:00 AM on the 16th to assume office and began working that day. This is the first time that a member of the Youth Party has been appointed as a minister after the government reorganization. Former Minister Zhou Yichun waited at the Ministry of Agriculture to meet and talk with him. Vice President Wang Yunwu and Political Commissar Lei Zhen both went to offer their congratulations. After Zuo and Zhou exchanged seals of office, they convened a meeting with the ministry's staff. Zhou Yichun first gave an introductory speech, saying that Minister Zuo has been a writer for ten years, an educator for ten years, and a politician for ten years in the past thirty years. In the future, I hope that all colleagues will continue to work hard under the leadership of Minister Zuo. Zuo Shunsheng then delivered a speech, first stating that his participation in the government this time was still in the spirit of working together to overcome national difficulties nine years ago. He humbly stated that he had been engaged in editing and educational work for twenty years and had been a councilor for more than nine years, but lacked experience in handling practical political affairs, and asked all staff to work together with one heart and one mind. Zuo pointed out that the policy guidelines agreed upon by all parties before the government was reorganized stipulated that stabilizing and improving people's lives was a responsibility that the Ministry of Agriculture had to share. Zuo stated that my country is an agricultural country, and more than 70% of the national population are farmers, but food and cotton cannot be self-sufficient, and daily necessities also rely on foreign countries, which is a terrible phenomenon. The export situation of silk, tea, vegetable oils, and bristles is also very worthy of attention, so we must strive for quality improvement in agricultural products through research and experimentation in the future in order to expand and promote production. Zuo asked all staff to put forward opinions on what should be promoted and what should be reformed and methods to overcome difficulties; especially how to fully utilize the assistance of foreign experts in the future, based on the report submitted by the Sino-American Agricultural Technical Cooperation Team last year, which he hoped that all staff would study. Finally, Zuo stated, "I hope that you will encourage and supervise each other and help the country overcome difficulties and help the people alleviate their suffering."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] After Zuo Shunsheng assumed office this morning, the people of the Ministry of Agriculture held a tea party in the afternoon to express their welcome. When reporters asked Zuo about the future policy guidelines of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Zuo firmly refused to express any opinions, saying, "If I were still a writer, I could freely express opinions and publish policy guidelines, but now that I am an executor, I cannot talk empty talk. Once a check is written, it must be realized." Zuo said in his speech at the tea party: "In the future, everything in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry can be made public. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is not a military secret, and there is nothing that cannot be said to others. Only by being open can we progress." Furthermore, the new Administrative Vice Ministers and Administrative Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Xie Chengping and Zhou Huangyun, are still awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan meeting. (Signed by Zuo)</p>
<h3>Chen Qitian to Be Minister of Economic Affairs? Zuo Shunsheng Says It Is Not Confirmed</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th] The Executive Yuan has scheduled a temporary meeting for 10:00 AM on the 18th. It is reported that the Youth Party Chen Qitian will succeed Li Huang as Minister of Economic Affairs. Chang Naide's replacement as a member of the National Government and the replacement candidates for the councilors who will serve as officials will be decided at the temporary meeting.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Zuo Shunsheng told reporters that Li Huang had decided not to take the position of Minister of Economic Affairs, and the rumor that Chen Qitian of the Youth Party would be transferred to the position had not been confirmed. Various construction implementation plans and will combine the various established plans with the results of on-site inspections, proceeding step by step, in order of priority and urgency. The peace policy implemented by Zhang in recent years will apparently achieve complementary effects with future active construction work.</p>
<h3>Mei Shuceng Proposes Merging the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury; The Legislative Yuan's Economic and Legal Committees Conduct a Preliminary Review</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th] The Economic and Legal Committees of the Legislative Yuan met on the morning of the 16th to conduct a preliminary review of the proposal by legislators Mei Shuceng and others to merge the national four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury into two institutions: the Central Bank and the National Business Bank, in order to save material and financial resources, strengthen credit, and develop business. Today's meeting was convened by Committee Member Li Qing, with representatives from various banks and bureaus in attendance, including Ji Chaoding, Cui Wei Wu, Zhu Tongjiu, Shou Miancheng, and Luo Yinpu. During the meeting, representatives from various banks and bureaus gave their reasons, hoping that the case could be deliberated from a long-term perspective before making a decision. The meeting adjourned at noon. According to the original proposal of Committee Member Mei, there were four major reasons: (1) Business conflicts. The businesses of various banks and bureaus, except for the Central Bank, are mostly difficult to classify and often conflict with each other, not only overlapping but also competing with each other. (2) Waste of human, financial, and material resources. The institutions of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury are established throughout the country. Not only are there separate institutions in the same city, but there are also opposing institutions on the same street. According to investigations, the National Bank has a total of 107 units, with 4,450 staff. The Central Bank has a total of 171 units domestically and 15 units abroad, with 3,365 staff. The Bank of Communications has a total of 173 units domestically and 5 units abroad, with 2,911 staff. The Agricultural Bank of China has a total of 255 units, with 4,621 staff. The Central Trust Bureau has a total of 37 units, with 1,675 staff. The number of staff in other postal and remittance bureaus and cooperative treasuries is unknown. The size of the organization and the number of personnel can be imagined, and the waste of national human, financial, and material resources can also be imagined. (3) Creation of a separatist phenomenon. The various banks, bureaus, and treasuries are all national financial institutions, but due to their different historical origins and personnel relationships, they each operate independently with strict boundaries, creating a separatist situation in the financial sector, making it difficult to implement a uniform and unified pace for the implementation of national financial policies. (4) Formation of a special class. The personnel of various banks, bureaus, and treasuries are all civil servants, but because all expenses do not need to rely on the national treasury, not only can office expenses be arbitrarily spent, but the salaries of staff can also not follow government regulations, enjoying special salaries and subsidies, creating a special class among civil servants. Due to the above four reasons, not only is there a need for adjustment in the system, but also for saving public funds, it should be merged. It is estimated that after merging into two institutions, at least more than 400 units and more than 8,000 staff can be cut. If the annual office expenses of each unit are calculated at 200 million yuan, 80 billion yuan can be saved annually. If the salary of each staff member is calculated at 20 million yuan per year, 160 billion yuan can also be saved. The functions of the two institutions after the merger are: the functions of the National Bank are to issue currency, regulate finance, manage the national treasury, and execute the mission of the "bank of banks"; the functions of the National Business Bank are industry and mining, agricultural loans, trade, forestry and fisheries, shipping, remittance, foreign exchange, overseas remittance, savings, trust, cooperation, and discount.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Returns from Inspection; Says the People's Livelihood in Southern Xinjiang Is Extremely Painful; Improving Water Conservancy and Transportation Is an Urgent Task</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 16th] Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Headquarters and Chairman of Xinjiang Province, recently returned from an inspection of southern Xinjiang. He departed from Dihua on the 16th of last month with Inspector Maxiwude, Vice Chairman Ahemaitijiang, and a dozen or so staff members, traveling through the administrative regions of Aksu, Kashgar, Shache, and Hotan and Kuqa. The round trip from Dihua to Kashgar was by plane, and the round trip from Kashgar to Shache and Hotan was by truck, covering a distance of 10,000 li. It was the first time since the Republic of China that the chief administrative officer of the entire province had personally inspected southern Xinjiang. Chairman Zhang told reporters that transportation and communications in southern Xinjiang were lagging behind, and the people along the way did not know where to get news from. Passing through the journey, in the remote rural areas, the residents did not fail to bring the old and the young, lined up to welcome, performing courteous etiquette, with sincere expressions, showing the people's enthusiasm for supporting the country. Not to mention the crowds in the cities, who turned out in large numbers to welcome enthusiastically. This expression of the people's emotions deeply moved him and made him realize the urgency of the people's expectations and the importance of his own responsibility. Speaking of the general phenomena of this trip, the geographical advantages of southern Xinjiang are significantly better than those of northern Xinjiang. Wherever there is water, there is dense shade, houses are lined up, and the population is dense. In addition, the weather is warm and the soil is fertile, so agricultural products are also very abundant. The people are inherently simple and cute. However, due to the inferiority of the past political environment, no attention has ever been paid to local construction. The people's cultural level and living standards are backward. The suffering of the people's livelihood is beyond imagination. Improving the people's livelihood is the most important task at present, especially the construction of water conservancy, the improvement of transportation, the improvement of medical facilities and the enrichment of medical talents, the improvement of school facilities, the large-scale compilation and printing of teaching materials, and the promotion of social education all need to be resolved urgently, and the streamlining of taxes and the reduction of the people's burden are the most urgent tasks. The provincial government should do its best to meet the people's urgent expectations. As for military discipline, Zhang said that after years of hard work, it has already made great progress, and the relationship between the military and the people is getting better every day. In particular, the National Army in the Aksu region is assisting the people in carrying out flood control projects on a large scale. He went to the construction site to investigate and personally saw the spirit of the military and the people working together and being harmonious and friendly. He was very gratified. Zhang has been back in Dihua for several days and is currently supervising the departments of the provincial government to study future politics.</p>
<h3>British MPs Urge Government to Pay Attention to the Current Situation in the Far East; Eden Concerned About the Current Situation in China</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 16th] During the foreign affairs debate in the House of Commons today, Conservative MP Fletcher accused the United States of putting a "rubber curtain" around Japan. He said: "We can lift one corner of the rubber curtain, but when we let go, the curtain immediately falls down again."</p>
<p>Other Conservative and Labour MPs joined Fletcher in calling on the British government to pay more attention to Japan. Fletcher said that the government should convince the United States that Britain is a good partner for the United States in the Far East and that Britain "has a traditional right to participate."</p>
<p>"Although Japan is shrouded in a rubber curtain, it is ultimately easier to open than the Iron Curtain."</p>
<p>Fletcher also said that the government must abandon its passive policy towards China: "We must do our best to encourage various commercial and trade organizations and work with the United States and other countries to conduct trade."</p>
<p>Labour MP Batan said, "The government has little interest in the Far East and should pay attention to it. If we are concerned about the long term, the problems that occur in the Far East in the future will be far more important than those in Europe."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden mentioned the Chinese problem in the foreign affairs debate in the House of Commons, expressing his sincere hope that the internal situation in China would improve and the long-standing friendly relations between China and Britain would continue to strengthen.

Eden also mentioned the property of British people in China, pointing out that although the Chinese senior authorities have allowed the return, it is still being detained by the Chinese. Many British overseas Chinese, especially the British employees of the former Shanghai Municipal Council, have been put in a difficult situation as a result. He hoped that the government would take steps to ensure that various legitimate claims are resolved within a reasonable period of time.</p>

<h3>Publicly Funded Students' Non-Staple Food Expenses Adjusted Every Three Months</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Executive Yuan held a review meeting at 10:30 AM on the 16th and then continued to hold a temporary political affairs meeting. In addition to other proposals, the following two proposals were also passed: (2) The non-staple food expenses for publicly funded students are calculated according to the proportion of living allowances for public school staff in various regions, as per established practice. After the living allowances for civil servants were adjusted in May, the non-staple food expenses for publicly funded students in various regions have increased by more than 80%. For the Shanghai area, it has increased from the original 24,000 yuan to 48,000 yuan, an increase of 100%. This should be handled accordingly immediately. In the future, if prices do not tend to stabilize, adjustments will be made every three months. (2) It is difficult to approve requests for non-staple food expenses for non-publicly funded students.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of CCP Members Surrender to the National Army</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 16th] After the recovery of Yanchi, CCP members have become increasingly dissatisfied with the various tyrannical policies of the CCP. They have been surrendering to the Ningxia National Army one after another, and the authorities are treating them favorably. The number of surrenders is increasing. As of now, there are already 220 people, including Ji Quan, Yang Xueyi, and Ma Zhanlin.

The declaration directly accuses the Communist army of being traitors.</p>
<h3>To Prevent Election Fraud, Laws and Regulations Should Be Formulated Quickly - Jian Guansan Talks About Cracking Down on Bribery in Elections</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Legislator Jian Guansan spoke today about cracking down on election fraud, saying that candidates should be restricted from using money, goods, banquets, force, and public or private positions as means of campaigning or as rewards. Whether the candidate comes forward himself or uses a third party indirectly, it should be considered illegal. Electors or agents who accept or request such conditions should also be considered illegal. In the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 15th, Jian proposed the formulation of the "Law on Cracking Down on Election Fraud." He believes that the content of this regulation should link together the articles related to elections in the criminal law with other matters related to election fraud to form a separate law. Jian said that in addition to legal restrictions, he hopes that the press will exert the power of social sanctions to achieve a responsive effect. He also recounted to reporters the reasons for his proposal: First, election fraud is inevitable even in advanced democratic countries. Therefore, the United Kingdom had the "Parliamentary Elections and Corrupt Practices Act" in 1880 and the "Prevention of Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act" in 1883, and France had the "Law on Cracking Down on Election Fraud" in 1902. Second, our country is in the initial stage of entering democracy, and election fraud is likely to increase. Therefore, it is even more necessary to formulate laws and regulations to prevent it in advance and punish it afterward. Moreover, in the past fifty years, the economic status of people below the middle class has been declining. If it is not forbidden to use money or power to carefully select candidates, the election results may be completely monopolized by those with wealth and power.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues in Lushan Area; National Army Troops Firmly Seize the Opportunity to Annihilate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 16th] The great battle to annihilate the main force of the Communist army in central Shandong is raging along the 140-kilometer Yimeng Mountain area in six places: Boshan, Laiwu, Xintai, Mengyin, Qingtuosi, and the Heyangzhen Highway. The National Army, with the cooperation of the army and air force, is pursuing and annihilating the Communist 7th Column, which has infiltrated near Heyangzhen and Qugiapo, 7 kilometers northeast of Zuoquan. As of the morning of the 16th, nearly 3,000 Communist troops have been annihilated. Furthermore, the Communist 4th Column, which counterattacked from Motianling, 12 kilometers north of Qingtuosi, to Jiepaiduo Village, 15 kilometers southeast of Mengyin, was bravely blocked by the National Army, and the battle was extremely fierce. On the 16th, the National Army defeated the main force of the Communist army in the area of Chunshuyu, Hengshan, and Dashanchang, 4 kilometers northeast of Jiepai, and is currently continuing to pursue and annihilate them in the Tianmashan, Pantuo Mountain, and Huangshishan areas, 6 kilometers northeast of Jiepai. In addition, the National Army, which is suppressing the Communist Zhang Guangzhong remnant from Jiunushan, 4 kilometers southwest of Mengyin, is currently surrounding them between Jiunushan and Mengyin and is concentrating on annihilating them. The National Army, which is moving south from Aoyangzhen on the Xinmeng Highway, defeated the main force of the Communist 3rd Column, which had infiltrated 5 kilometers southeast of Aoyangzhen, at 3 p.m. on the 16th, and is continuing to pursue and annihilate them towards Fangshan. The National Army's sweeping force on the Xinlai Highway completely cleared the Communist troops near Yanzhuang and Mengyin Village on the 16th and has joined forces with the southern National Army. Furthermore, the Communist 1st Column, which retreated northeast towards the Tusikou area, has now been repelled by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jifu, 16th] Battles in the central and southern Shandong areas of Juxian, Yishui, near Mengyin, Xintai, and the intermediate area south of Boshan are continuing. The National Army has recovered many small villages and towns. Sangzidian and Qihe on the outskirts of Jinan are both calm.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 15th] In the area of Qihe, Yancheng, and Sangzidian on the north bank of the Yellow River on the outskirts of Jinan, the fighting turned calm on the 15th. In the triangular area of Changqing, Pingyin, and Feicheng south of Jinan, scattered Communist troops are lurking. The National Army has been strengthening its clearing operations since the 14th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Ziyang, 15th] The reporter visited Commander Wang Jingjiu today. According to him, the National Army is currently engaged in a new deployment, and the situation in Shandong Province will undergo a major change in the short term.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 15th] The Shandong National Army is currently focusing on clearing the Communist troops in the southern and central Shandong areas. Therefore, the general offensive against the Chuan and Boshan areas has not yet been launched. As of the 15th, the situation south of Boshan remains deadlocked in the Hezhuang area outside Qingshiguan. However, Zibo has suffered great damage, the mining area has been destroyed, and the suburbs have been half-burned. The local losses are extremely heavy. The Communist 9th and 6th Columns near Mengyin and Sishui, and the Communist 2nd and 7th Columns in the Juxian and Yishui areas, are avoiding combat and fleeing everywhere, but the National Army has formed an encirclement, gradually shrinking it, and searching for its main force at any time to annihilate it. In the past three days, 20,000 Communist troops have been annihilated. The recovery of Ju and Yi is only a matter of time. The situation on the outskirts of Jinan has eased. There were no changes in the battle situation on the 15th. The situation near Sangzidian is deadlocked in Balizhuang, and Qihe is also confronting the city to the west.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] The decisive battle in the area east of Mengyin continued on the 16th. The Communist army is stubbornly making a last-ditch effort, and the National Army is also firmly seizing the opportunity to annihilate them. The intensity of the battle is unprecedented. The National Army, which defended Changde during the Anti-Japanese War, once defeated ten times its number with a single battalion today. Judging from the situation on the battlefield, the National Army clearly has the upper hand. Furthermore, although some small teams of Communist troops attempted to disrupt the road from Linyi and Mengyin to Xintai and Laiwu in order to divert the National Army's attention, they were also driven out or resolved by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 16th] Automobiles between Jinan and Tai'an are now running smoothly. The Jinpu Railway Bureau has been ordered to rush repairs northward from Guxian day and night. Recently, due to the large number of troops gathered between Tai'an and Jinan, there has been a housing shortage. Merchants and civilians in various places have voluntarily provided their houses for the army to live in, which is a testament to the public's warm welcome to the National Army.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming Takes Office, Announces Four New Measures, Martial Law Lifted Throughout the Province, Clearing Operations End</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 16th] The Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office was officially abolished today and changed to the Taiwan Provincial Government. This morning at 9:00 AM, the first Chairman, Wei Daoming, went to the Provincial Government to take office. Ge Jing'en, the former Secretary-General of the Office, handled the handover on behalf of Chief Executive Chen Yi, and no ceremony was held. In order to strive for social stability in Taiwan Province, Wei first announced: (1) Lifting the martial law that has been in effect throughout the province for two months and six days. (2) Ending the ongoing clearing operations in various parts of the province. (3) Abolishing censorship of newspapers, books, and postal and telecommunications. (4) Revoking military control over transportation and communication institutions. The above four matters will be implemented starting today. It is said that they were decided after consultation with Peng Mengji, the Commander of the Taiwan Provincial Garrison. Wei also announced that the exchange rate between Taiwan dollars and legal tender will be changed from 1:40 to 1:44 starting today in order to stabilize the economy of Taiwan Province. It is understood that Wei had agreed with the central government on changing the exchange rate while he was in Nanjing, and now it has been formally announced. Wei then convened the first provincial government meeting at 10:00 AM, during which the abolition of the following five institutions was approved: the Legislative Committee, the Taiwan Provincial Design and Assessment Committee, the Taiwan Provincial Public Enterprise Management Committee, the Taiwan Provincial Translation Bureau, and the Press Office. Other existing institutions that may be reorganized will be temporarily retained until a decision is made. Regarding the dismissal of civil servants, Chen Yi had already promulgated measures before leaving Taiwan, providing each person with severance pay and travel expenses, totaling four months of salary. Personnel dismissed before Chen Yi left, as well as those who are surplus due to organizational changes in the future, will be handled in accordance with these regulations. According to responsible sources, as of now, the new personnel who have come to Taiwan with Wei, including committee members and department heads, are less than fifty people. Therefore, in addition to abolishing the original institutions, they are extremely eager for the original personnel to continue to serve. In addition, Qiu Niantai, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, is still firmly declining the position, and various parties are still trying to persuade him to stay. Qiu is currently in Shanghai undergoing a medical examination, and his duties are temporarily being performed by Committee Member Zhu Foding.</p>
<h3>Special Treasury Bonds to Be Issued Soon - Zhang Jia'ao Calls Experts for Discussion for Days - Denominations Will Range from 100,000 to 5,000,000</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The issuance of special short-term treasury bonds is imminent. Central Bank Governor Zhang is calling experts in Nanjing for discussions in order to ensure the smooth issuance of the bonds. It is reported that in order to enable the general public to purchase them widely, the denominations of the bonds will start from 100,000 yuan, and then be divided into 500,000, 1,000,000, and 5,000,000 yuan, etc. There will also be registered and unregistered types, allowing purchasers to choose freely. (The US dollar bonds issued during the Anti-Japanese War also had registered and unregistered types). In order to facilitate the purchase procedure, the method of filling in the purchase date on the bond may be adopted, so that people can buy them on any day. Various parties have generally responded well to the government's proposal. The only concern is the fear that it will affect the promotion of US dollar bonds. However, according to a financial expert, although the interest rate on special short-term treasury bonds is higher than that on US dollar bonds, the government's ultimate goal in issuing these treasury bonds is to bring legal tender back into circulation and stabilize prices. After the above two goals are achieved, interest rates will naturally fall accordingly, and the promotion of US dollar bonds will not be affected. As for whether the government's burden of excessively high interest rates can absorb more floating capital than the interest it bears, it is also an unnecessary worry. The issuance of short-term treasury bonds has precedents in countries such as England and France, either to make up for budget deficits or to issue them temporarily for a specific purpose. The special short-term treasury bonds that our country will issue now will be discontinued after achieving the aforementioned two goals.</p>

<h3>Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau, He Yushu, Takes Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th] The newly appointed Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau, He Yushu, took office at 3:00 PM on the 16th and spoke to reporters about his future policy guidelines: (1) To plan for both military grain and civilian food.

<h3>Suzhou's Grain Reserves Are Scarce - Decision to Purchase from Other Ports</h3>

<h3>The Issue of Reparations from Japan - Difficult to Resolve Quickly</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] The Far Eastern Commission and its Reparations Subcommittee have received individual applications from Allied countries for reparations from Japan in recent days. The total amount is so huge that the occupation authorities cannot allow it. A quick solution to the reparations issue is therefore impossible. The Far Eastern Commission hoped to agree on various foundations at the next meeting, and based on these foundations, accept applications for reparations, so that the Reparations Subcommittee could determine the proportion of reparations that each applicant country should receive. It is reported that in the past week, the percentages submitted by the applicant countries have far exceeded the total amount. The United States, as the main participant in the Pacific War, demands to receive at least half of Japan's reparations, but declares that it intends to distribute this asset to other Allied countries, especially the Philippines and Korea, and a small portion to the United Kingdom. China, as the second largest applicant country, is demanding 40 percent. The Philippines is demanding about 15 percent. It is reported that both the United Kingdom and France rank third among the applicant countries. Other countries believe that considering the extent of the UK and France's contributions to the Pacific War, these huge demands are unreasonable. People in the Far Eastern Commission feel that the Allied countries are haggling, which is the opposite of what happens in other Allied countries, especially Canada and New Zealand. It is reported that Canada is only asking for 1.5 percent, and New Zealand is asking for 2 percent. These numbers can hardly be reduced further. The amount requested by Australia is still unknown. A spokesman for the Department of the Army said that MacArthur has requested additional engineers to help with the distribution of reparations. The Department of the Army has not received any defamation regarding the handling of Japanese reparations work.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Path to Peace and Stability</h3>
<p>In the past ten days or so, labor strikes, student protests, and rice riots have occurred one after another. The social unrest and the instability of people's minds are almost indescribable. Furthermore, soaring prices and the hardship of people's livelihood have made the majority feel anxious, as if they are unable to bear the heavy oppression. Therefore, the whole country, from top to bottom, almost universally yearns for stability, so that the people in dire straits can have a chance to catch their breath.</p>
<p>In fact, after our country won victory after eight years of war, the wounds were deep and the pain was great. The government should have rested and recuperated with the people to cultivate the nation's strength. And the government certainly did not want to do otherwise. It was only because of the Communist Party's problem. As soon as the war of resistance stopped, the flames of civil war started again, resulting in today's chaotic situation. In the areas affected by the war, they have suffered direct disasters of artillery fire, making life impossible. Even in the areas not affected by the war, they have indirectly suffered from its adverse effects. Not only is it impossible to improve people's lives, but they also languish in dire straits like the people in the war zones. Now, more than ever, we feel the need to seek peace and stability quickly. Otherwise, if things continue this way, the nation will fall into an irrecoverable predicament! We do not want to be alarmist, but because of the responsibility of our position, we must raise the awareness of the people about the current situation in order to promote the early realization of domestic peace and universal stability.</p>
<p>First, we believe that stability and peace are inseparable. If the civil unrest does not stop for a day, then social stability cannot be fully realized for a day. Therefore, if we want universal stability, we must first demand the realization of genuine and comprehensive peace in the country. In view of the fact that the government's past "unilateral ceasefire" (this is what Zhou Enlai said criticizing the government after the government issued the ceasefire order) failed to achieve domestic peace, we have to appeal to both sides, asking the Communist Party to leave a glimmer of hope for the people of the country, quickly lay down their arms, and turn swords into ploughshares. We also ask the government to seize the fleeting opportunity to resume peace talks, so that domestic politics can turn hostility into true harmony. The reason why we are particularly emphasizing the Communist Party in today's call for peace is not to favor the government. Because we believe that the government authorities' desire for peace and stability is even above that of the general public. In the past, in order to achieve domestic peace, the government issued ceasefire orders several times. However, because this ceasefire order was, as Mr. Zhou Enlai said, "unilateral," it failed to achieve peace. Also, in order to adopt a political approach to resolve the CCP issue, the government has not only repeatedly tried to resume peace talks, but has also not closed the door to peace talks to this day. When the National Assembly was convened last year, the government sincerely welcomed representatives of the CCP and the Democratic League to participate. Even recently, the quota of CCP and Democratic League members in the reorganized National Government is still vacant, as long as the CCP can wake up, and prioritize the interests of the nation, immediately abandon the attempt to seize power by force. Taking the opportunity of the参政会 meeting, resume peace talks with the government, then the current political deadlock may not be difficult to break. Therefore, the key to domestic peace or war can be said to be entirely in the hands of the CCP. As Wang Chonghui said: "Whether peace talks can be resumed depends entirely on the CCP's decision. Realizing peace cannot be achieved by one side's hope alone. The CCP must also be sincere to make it possible." Our appeal for peace to the CCP in the face of the people's hardship may be enough to encourage the CCP to adopt a policy of promoting economic collapse through war. The current domestic situation may be exactly what the CCP is seeking. But we have to solemnly inform the CCP that if a political party does not take the welfare of the people as its premise, it will not be able to win the support of the people and will lose its essence as a political party. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the CCP can have a thorough awakening, prioritize the nation and the people, immediately lay down their arms, and leave a glimmer of hope for the people of the country.</p>
<p>Second, since what the people are yearning for day and night is peace and stability, the government authorities should do everything they can to strive for the early realization of peace and stability. Now the government has been reorganized, and the Min and Qing parties and social elites have also participated, sharing the important responsibility of the country with the Kuomintang. This is nothing less than adding a new factor to the realization of domestic peace and stability. At the same time, the policy guidelines announced by the new government after the reorganization also focus on striving for domestic stability and resolving the Communist Party issue through political means after the restoration of railway transportation. It can be seen that today's government is truly shouldering the responsibility of achieving peace and stability. The government after the reorganization, in terms of its nature, seems to be a transitional government before the implementation of constitutional government. Its only task is to complete all the necessary preparatory work for the implementation of constitutional government. However, the implementation of constitutional government is inseparable from domestic peace and stability. If peace and stability cannot be achieved, then even if constitutional government is implemented, it will still be flawed in terms of democratic significance. Therefore, we hope that the reorganized government must not consider itself a temporary government and neglect its important responsibilities to the country. It must be understood that even if the government is transitional, its responsibility remains consistent. In the future, all the government's policy measures should be divided into priorities. All important and urgent matters, after careful study and adoption of measures, should concentrate all efforts and spare no cost to ensure their implementation. Conversely, all secondary and non-urgent matters should be put on hold. We have already said above that what the whole country unanimously demands today is peace and stability. President Zhang Qun's promise to the people during the war was also peace and stability. In the future, the government should take this as the general direction of all its efforts. On the positive side, it should find ways to achieve the realization of comprehensive peace as soon as possible. On the negative side, it should also make every effort to avoid measures that stimulate social unrest. Today, the constant occurrence of labor strikes, student protests, and rice riots is due to many reasons, but the authorities' clumsiness and indecision cannot be excused. The government should be cautious in its actions and avoid acting rashly on any new measures. Although we cannot advocate "governance by doing nothing" at this time, all words and deeds that stimulate prices and incite the masses should be avoided as much as possible in times of unrest. Only in this way can we avoid adding to social unrest in the midst of chaos!</p>
<p>Third, we must also appeal to the people of the whole country to collectively exert effort for the movement of peace and stability with the spirit of "seeking solutions from ourselves," thereby showing the real power of the people. The failure of past peace talks was due to many reasons, but the most important one was that the government only knew how to value the opinions of parties and factions and neglected the opinions of honest people. To be honest, although there are many parties and factions in China today, we assume that each party has a considerable number of followers, but its followers are still a minority compared to the total number of people in the country. Today, for the sake of their own interests and for the sake of the country's interests, the people should no longer remain silent and must stand up and speak for themselves. The government wants to achieve the realization of peace and stability. It has listened enough to the opinions of various parties and factions in the past. In the future, it should listen more to the voices of the people of the whole country. Because only by relieving the suffering of the people can social stability be achieved, and only the real people can understand the suffering of the people. But how will the people express their opinions? We, the people, must also know that only by using legal means to tell the government about the hardships of the people and resolutely demand that the government adopt reasonable policies can social stability be achieved. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that the government can pay special attention to the public opinion of the whole country. On the other hand, we also hope that the people of the whole country can stand up and tell the truth. In this way, communication between the top and bottom, and the integration of opinions from all sides, will naturally produce a plan for peace and stability. As long as both the top and bottom can abide by and follow the plan, it will not be difficult to achieve its goal. More specifically, institutions that can better represent public opinion, whether it is the upcoming National参政会 or the Intention Implementation Promotion Association formed by representatives of the National Assembly, should immediately publicly discuss during this period how to force the government and the Communist army to immediately cease fire on the spot, and force both sides to comply in earnest. If the government still wants to gather ideas and benefit from all sources, the speakers and deputy speakers of the provincial and municipal councils, the heads of national non-governmental organizations, and the leaders of the cultural, educational, industrial, commercial, and economic sectors, who can somewhat represent the true public opinion at this time, should be more valuable than the opinions of parties and factions. The government can also convene them to the capital and even invite representatives of the Communist Party to listen to the appeals of the people. They all come from the people, know the hardships of the people, and can express the hopes of the people. Only by relieving the hardships of the people and achieving the hopes of the people can the government achieve social stability.</p>

<h3>Palestine Investigation Team Formed; UN Special Session Declares Adjournment; Indian Representative Makes Earnest Appeal to Arab Groups</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 15th] The United Nations Special General Assembly held its final meeting today, passing the Political Committee's resolution by a vote of 40 to 0, to organize a Palestine investigation committee consisting of eleven small countries. Those who abstained from voting included Adam Khan, Belarus, Czech Republic, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, Ukraine, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and 13 other countries.</p>
<p>The General Assembly also passed the agenda of the investigation committee by a vote of 45 to 7. The General Assembly further unanimously (Arab countries abstaining) passed a resolution proposed by Norway and amended by El Salvador, urging all governments and people, especially residents of the Holy Land, to refrain from using force or other actions that could harm the early resolution of the Palestine issue before the General Assembly takes action. Before the adjournment, Indian representative Ambassador Ali made the most earnest appeal to the Arab countries, and emphasized that if peace in Palestine is destroyed, World War III will inevitably break out soon. Ambassador Ali urged the Arabs to be patient and abide by peace, as preserving peace will strengthen the Arab position. Palestine has now become a testing ground for human conscience, and the future of mankind depends on the resolutions of the United Nations organization. If the总合国 organization makes a wrong decision, the whole world will not be able to achieve peace.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Flushing, 15th] It was announced here tonight that the Palestine investigation committee will hold its first meeting on the 26th at Lake Success. The committee will first prepare its work plan and route in New York, and then depart for Palestine and other affiliated areas to conduct investigations. UN Secretary-General Lie has informed the eleven countries participating in the committee that each country will only send one chief representative and one alternate representative. During the investigation, the committee will, like the previous Balkan Investigation Committee, work in subgroups. The secretariat will send about forty personnel to serve on the investigation committee, led by Assistant Secretary-General Dr. Hu Shi-ze of China.</p>
<h3>US Aid to South Korea Plan Will Be Non-Military in Nature</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] Regarding the US plan to provide $200 million in aid to the US-occupied area of Korea, a responsible source told an Agence France-Presse reporter that this plan is different from the aid plans for Turkey and Greece and will be strictly non-military in nature. The US government will soon ask Congress to approve the necessary funds to aid Korea. State Department officials held a meeting this morning to discuss this issue, which lasted for a considerable amount of time. There are still many difficulties in politically and economically unifying Korea within the scope of the US-Soviet agreement, and the US aid plan for Korea may be slightly revised. The US government does not believe that this plan will hinder the meeting of the US-Soviet Joint Commission scheduled to be held in Seoul on May 20. The talks between the US and Soviet representatives will be on purely technical issues. The US authorities remain silent about the results of the US-Soviet talks. Although it is not entirely impossible to resolve the Korean issue within the scope of the US-Soviet agreement, the future is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Three Soviet Representatives Arrive in Seoul</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Seoul, 16th] After General Korotkov, commander of the Soviet forces in North Korea, accepted the invitation of Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US forces in Korea, to participate in the US-Soviet Joint Commission on May 20 to establish a provisional government in Korea, three members of the Soviet advance team arrived here by train from Pyongyang on the 16th. The Soviet delegation will have about 75 members.</p>
<h3>US Naval Leaders Strive to Advocate Military Force as a Backing for Diplomacy Request House Committee to Pass Naval Budget Bill</h3>
<p>[This newspaper news] San Francisco, 16th broadcast: US Admiral Nimitz delivered an important speech in the House Appropriations Committee today, stating that Britain and the United States are the two major countries in the world with the strongest navies and have now united and stand on the same side. Other key points of the speech are as follows: (1) The power of the United Nations is still insufficient to guarantee international peace; (2) US military leaders are drafting a "perfect plan" to prepare for full industrial mobilization in another war; (3) The timing for radio-controlled warfare is not yet ripe, so a strong military force must be maintained; (4) President Truman's $3.5 billion naval budget bill must be passed. Nimitz emphasized that the current situation is extremely chaotic, and the United States must not reduce its military strength before it improves, otherwise US diplomacy will lose its support.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Secretary of the Navy Forrest told the House Appropriations Committee that the United States believes that the "push-button warfare" tactic cannot be realized in the short term, but the United States hopes to be prepared for this tactic when it is realized. He believes that the army, navy, and air force are still necessary for successful combat. So far, technical research in the field of transporting atomic bombs is still very far from the realization of "push-button warfare."</p>
<h3>Truman Writes to Congress Urging Speedy Passage of Relief Bill</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] President Truman, in submitting the tenth quarterly report to the United Nations today, wrote to Congress, once again urging Congress to pass a bill to provide $350 million in relief to China and European countries, and requested that Congress approve US participation in the International Refugee Organization and allocate $75 million in donations to the organization.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] The Senate and House of Representatives today discussed a bill to provide relief to foreign countries after the UNRAA ended, but failed to reach an agreement and will reconvene tomorrow to continue the discussion. The Senate supports the full amount of $350 million, while the House advocates reducing it to $200 million.</p>
<h3>In the Next Three or Four Years The US Will Make Huge Loans Reaching $5 Billion Annually</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] What further measures should be taken after the US $400 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey is passed and implemented is a matter of general concern. People in Washington are increasingly convinced that the United States will lend approximately $5 billion annually to various countries in need over the next three or four years to implement the Truman doctrine of containment. Although this number is a private estimate, it comes from senior officials. Wallace also quoted this figure in a speech in Chicago, referring to it as essential to the permanent restoration of the lives of the people of Europe and Asia. Now that the aid plan for Greece and Turkey has been passed, the next step for the government is to seek Congressional and popular support for its global multi-billion dollar aid plan. According to detailed estimates, countries around the world will receive $16 billion worth of goods from the United States this year, while US imports will be half of this amount, or $8 billion. $3 billion of the difference can be paid for by the countries' gold and foreign exchange reserves, as well as US dollars used by Americans in those countries, but the remaining $5 billion can only be paid for by loans from the United States to those countries. There should be a similar difference in the next two or three years.</p>
<h3>Aid to Greece and Turkey Sent to the White House for Signature</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th] Congress today authorized President Truman to implement the $400 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey. The Senate and House of Representatives Conference Committee has taken extremely rapid action to adjust the differences in the provisions of the two houses and has sent the entire plan to the White House for the President to sign and appoint officials to be responsible for its implementation. The first group of government representatives will fly to Athens at the end of this week. In addition, the State Department requested appropriations for this fiscal year, and the House is working to pass them, but it will cancel $31 million for foreign propaganda and broadcasting to China.</p>
<h3>Bevin Will Visit Germany in the Near Future To Encourage Germans to Overcome the Crisis Themselves</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 16th] The British Foreign Office recently revealed that Foreign Secretary Bevin plans to visit Germany in the near future to encourage Germans to work hard to overcome their food crisis and industrial crisis. It is reported that Bevin decided to inspect the British occupation zone after listening to the leaders of the British occupation zone in Germany submit an urgent report to London on the food crisis there. As for the date of Bevin's trip, it has not yet been determined, as he needs to rest before going to Germany.</p>
<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Approves Treaty of Peace with Italy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today approved a bill on the Treaty of Peace with Italy by a vote of thirteen to zero, and explained that the total amount of compensation paid by Italy is $360 million, which will be paid off in seven years, and cannot be considered too harsh. This treaty is the first step in restoring peace and order in Europe.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates Foreign Policy Bevin Emphasizes Importance of Upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference Hopes Four-Power Treaty Against Germany Can Finally Be Realized</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] The House of Commons began a two-day foreign policy debate today. Foreign Secretary Bevin declared that the Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in London in November may be the most important conference in world history. If relations between East and West cannot enter a more satisfactory state than before, then no one can predict the future course of the world. Bevin expressed deep regret over the lack of agreement on the Four-Power Treaty, saying that Britain, France, and other Western countries all believe that the US-proposed Four-Power Treaty against Germany is an extremely important event. Unfortunately, the Soviet Union put forward amendments that were not directly related to this matter and stated that it could not accept the US proposal otherwise.　America's response to the call for East-West cooperation from all over the world has, in fact, built a bridge of communication between the two major opinions, and the establishment of this connection is sufficient to change the course of world affairs. He deeply hopes that an atmosphere in which this treaty can be concluded can be established before the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in November. He hopes that this treaty will eventually become a reality one day. Bevin also believes that the US-proposed Four-Power Treaty against Germany foreshadows how the course of world affairs will change. Therefore, before the London Foreign Ministers' Conference is convened, an atmosphere must be created so that this proposal can be adopted. Bevin also said that as a result of the war, the whole of Central Europe must be rebuilt. The delay of this task will inevitably increase the difficulties. Therefore, work should begin as soon as possible to organize the next stage of work in Germany. In reviewing the work of the Moscow Conference, Bevin said that there was no intention to overturn the Potsdam Agreement, but to realize it in its entirety, not just to select one part of it. The British government has not refused to consider using German industrial production as compensation, but it feels that there is an order of priority. The first thing to be dealt with is the economic unification of Germany, a balanced economy, and the reimbursement of expenses paid by Britain to maintain Germany's survival since the occupation of Germany. This is a legitimate demand. After this demand is resolved, the issue of compensation with industrial products can be discussed. Bevin continued to talk about the German-Polish border issue, saying that Britain must first study the facts before announcing its final decision. However, he believes that Poland cannot turn to Germany for compensation because its eastern land has been incorporated into the Soviet Union. Regarding the economic merger of the British and American zones in Germany, Bevin believes that it must be implemented as an economic emergency action for the benefit of Germany and the whole of Europe. Regarding the food crisis in Germany, he believes that rations are expected to improve in three months. Finally, he expressed his hope and belief that the merger agreement between the British and American zones will promote the unification of Germany.</p>
<h3>Eden Blames Soviet Union for Lack of Achievement at Foreign Ministers' Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 15th Special Dispatch] Former British Foreign Secretary Eden commented in the House of Commons this afternoon that it was regrettable that this Moscow Conference had failed to reach an agreement on any major issues. He attributed this failure to the "obstinacy" of the Soviet Union in a straightforward tone. He also believes that this stubborn attitude is unreasonable and incomprehensible. Discussing the German issue, he said that Britain has a special responsibility for Germany, and if it cannot reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, then Britain must act regardless of the Soviet Union. Most of the British people hope to cooperate with the Soviet Union, but this attitude of hoping for cooperation cannot be maintained unilaterally.</p>
<h3>The Three-Party Secretary-General Meeting for the Fourth Time: Agreement Reached on New Cabinet Policies; Conservatives Still Oppose Socialist Party Nomination for Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The third meeting of the four party secretaries-general was held at 2:00 PM today in the Speaker's office of the House of Representatives. Socialist Party Secretary-General Nishio, Liberal Party Secretary-General Ohno, Democratic Party Secretary-General Sada, and National Cooperative Party Policy Research Council Chairman Miki all attended. Negotiations on policy agreements reached coordination and passed in the meeting. The content: (1) Important industries will be managed by the state. (2) Establishment of a sound fiscal and financial control system to prevent inflation. (3) Continued payment of interest on national debt. (4) Improvement of the rice purchase system. The issue of the ratio of the Prime Minister and cabinet member allocations will be discussed again on the 17th. However, both the Liberal and Democratic parties are quite reserved about Katayama's appointment as Prime Minister. Katayama himself is also very cautious on this issue and has now decided to visit Liberal Party President Yoshida and Democratic Party Chief Advisor Saito separately on the 17th to exchange views.</p>
<p>[International News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The organizational work of the Japanese coalition cabinet has now begun the second stage of selecting the Prime Minister and allocating cabinet members. The Liberal and Democratic parties have currently stated: "The Prime Minister should be decided by the majority," which strengthens the conservative parties' confidence that "the Prime Minister should be selected from the conservative faction with the largest number of seats." On the 15th, when the Liberal Party held an internal cadre meeting, they unanimously supported Secretary-General Ohno's insistence that "they cannot agree to the Socialist Party's appointment as Prime Minister." Although the Democratic Party has different opinions on the issue of party president selection, with Kijuro Shidehara, Hitoshi Ashida, and Saito each holding their own view, they are united in their strong opposition to the Socialist Party's appointment as Prime Minister. Therefore, the Liberal and Democratic parties' positions on the coalition cabinet, especially the selection of the Prime Minister, appear to be moving towards taking the same steps.</p>
<p>Yoshida Cabinet to Resign En Masse on Tuesday</p>
<p>[International News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The Japanese Yoshida Cabinet decided at a cabinet meeting on the 16th that the cabinet would resign en masse before the first Diet session on the 20th. Prime Minister Yoshida has decided to visit the Emperor on the morning of the 20th to submit his resignation. [United Press, Air Fortress Unit, 16th] A vanguard bomber team consisting of 130 air fortresses took off at dawn on the 16th to practice "simulated air control" over New York, Philadelphia, Washington, and other East Coast cities. The bomber team took off from six bases in the west, south, and southwest, and after concentrating over Cape May, flew directly to its destination. New York City was attacked for the first time at 12:30 PM Eastern Standard Time (1:30 AM Shanghai time), followed by four aircraft sweeping the coast and attacking seven major cities. The purpose of the Army Air Corps sending air fortresses to perform in the air is to show residents along the Pacific coast that "the taxes they pay are not wasted." The exercise was commanded by Brigadier General Ramey, and the altitude of each aircraft will be between 3,000 and 5,000 feet, and the formation will be two miles long. Individual attacks by each aircraft will last 40 seconds, and the entire exercise will be completed in 3 hours and 30 minutes. In war, 130 air fortresses can carry 1,000 tons of incendiary bombs or bombs.</p>
<p>Katayama Announces Policy Program</p>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 16th] Socialist leader Katayama, speaking at a luncheon at the Tokyo Foreign Correspondents' Club this afternoon, declared that after taking office as Prime Minister, his administration's policies would be based on those of the British Labor Party government, especially regarding state ownership of enterprises. He said that the Social Democratic Party's plan is to guide Japanese political opinion into the path of democracy, making Japan a completely peaceful country and establishing a state-controlled economy. Due to the current economic situation, it is appropriate to organize a coalition government, but the basic policies of the Socialist Party will not change because of this. The main points currently under discussion are which party will serve as Prime Minister and how the heads of each department will be allocated. Since the Socialist Party has become the largest party after this election and its policies are the only ones that can overcome the current crisis, the position of Prime Minister should belong to the Socialist Party. Katayama continued that his policies will be implemented gradually and will never use strikes or demonstrations. The Socialist Party opposes the Communist Party and its methods.</p>
<h3>Wei Lihuang in Paris to Meet with French Minister of Defense</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 15th] General Wei Lihuang arrived here today from London and will stay here for two weeks to visit various military schools and facilities, and meet with French military leaders. He will be received by French Minister of Defense Flores tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<h3>France Officially Announces Policy on Vietnam: Decides to Continue Ruling Vietnam; Bollaert Delivers Important Speech</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Hanoi, 16th] French Commissioner to Vietnam Bollaert delivered a speech last night, suggesting that Cambodia and Laos should be autonomous, and that Tonkin, Annam, and Cochinchina should eventually be unified within the framework of the French Union. France will remain in Vietnam, and Vietnam will remain in the French Union; this is the first principle of France's policy on Vietnam. France reserves the right to rule Vietnam, without oppressing or disregarding the legitimate patriotic sentiments of the Vietnamese people.</p>
<h3>Indonesia Joins the United Nations; Netherlands Suggests Waiting Two More Years</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 15th] The Dutch delegation to the United Nations has announced that the Netherlands intends to recommend to the United Nations that the Dutch East Indies become a member state of the United Nations within two years. Because the Indian representative Ali advocated that Indonesia, with a population of 70 million, should join the United Nations, the Dutch representative Roy proposed this suggestion, arguing that the Netherlands should represent Indonesia during a two-year transition period, after which the Netherlands will submit an application for it.</p>
<h3>World War II Was a "War of Futility"; Churchill Once Told Roosevelt</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 15th] The town of Ayr, Scotland, today awarded former British Prime Minister Churchill the title of Freeman of the City. He gave a speech stating: U.S. President Roosevelt asked me in 1943: "What should World War II be called?" I replied: "World War II should be called a war of futility." I have often said that preventing World War II was easier than any other war. After the fall of Paris, I urged the French army to adopt guerrilla warfare to contain 100 divisions of the German army. General Weygand said that even if France adopted guerrilla warfare to contain the German army, Germany would still have 100 to 150 divisions to conquer Britain. He asked me at the time: "What will you do?" I immediately replied: "I am not a military expert and always carefully avoid interfering in such matters, but my military advisors believe that the best way to deal with a German invasion is to drown the Germans halfway across, the more the better, and then strike the landing Germans head-on."</p>
<h3>Wallace Again Criticizes American Domestic and Foreign Policies; Denies Plans to Appease the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Deirdre, USA, 15th] Former Vice President Wallace delivered a speech here tonight, strongly arguing that partisan politics are leading the United States to depression and another tragic world war. Wallace said that his recent trip to Europe was to search for the power of defending the world. If the current difficulties continue, we will encounter economic collapse. If the current foreign policy continues, we will encounter violence and bloodshed, and war will be inevitable one day. The appropriate remedy is to establish a good post-war relief plan for veterans, implement progressive income tax, develop natural resources, ban racial discrimination, reduce prices, and maintain consumer purchasing power. As for American domestic policy, it only makes the rich richer, the poor poorer, and the free less free. Wallace finally criticized President Truman's policy, which aims to disperse Britain's large troops and weaken Britain's power. This policy, which weakens the Labor Party, makes world unity hopeless. Wallace also said: When I traveled in Europe, I found that Scandinavia feared that Truman's policies might lead to war. Public opinion in France believes that the Truman Doctrine has created a rift between the French parties and supports de Gaulle's actions to overthrow parliamentary politics. American policy is actually de Gaulle's main tool. I now want to ask whether U.S. Ambassador to France Caffery's relationship with de Gaulle has been approved by the State Department.</p>
<p>[United Press, Deirdre, 15th] Wallace denied to reporters here on the 15th that he intended to appease the Soviet Union, saying, "I am seeking cooperation with the Soviet Union and using American resources to promote world peace and prosperity. I do not think that cooperation with the Soviet Union is appeasement. I really want to achieve world peace and prosperity."</p>
<h3>Abruptly Changing Attitude, Willing to Cooperate with Franco</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th] British Labor MP Dr. Follick, who met with Spanish heir to the throne Don Juan in Lisbon this week, said during a foreign policy debate in the House of Commons that Don Juan told him that in order to realize Spain's constitutional monarchy, he was willing to cooperate with Franco to smoothly change the dictatorship to a constitutional system. Dr. Follick said that this was a major concession by Don Juan, as Don Juan had never previously expressed his willingness to cooperate with Franco in any way. Mr. Follick added that Don Juan also told him that after taking the throne, he would be an absolute constitutional monarch like the King of England, above party lines and would never interfere in politics.</p>
<h3>German Food Crisis</h3>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 16th] According to reliable sources, the German food crisis will extend to the Soviet occupation zone (where food supplies have always been more abundant than in other zones).</p>
<h3>Italian Socialist Leader Nitti Ordered to Form Cabinet</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, Rome, 16th] The Italian Socialist leader Nitti has been officially announced to have been ordered by President Nicola to start forming a new government.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Rome, 16th] Nitti is a financial expert, 70 years old, and was Prime Minister before the Fascist Party came to power. He does not belong to any party and will generally try to form an expanded "national unity" government to succeed De Gasperi's three-party coalition cabinet.</p>
<h3>British Minister of War Invited to France</h3>
<p>[French News Agency, London, 15th] British Minister of War Belenger, at the invitation of French Minister of War Flores, is scheduled to fly to Paris this afternoon to visit French army training camps.</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, told reporters yesterday: The municipal government will still publish three kinds of living indices for workers, employees, and Western residents this month. The calculation of employee base salaries, as passed by the municipal meeting, will remain unchanged, that is, without discounts. The calculation of worker wages will be implemented in accordance with the central government's "Provisional Measures for Adjusting Wages of Workers and Employees in Shanghai," and the wage increases will not be discounted. Wages exceeding the work amount will be paid in full, without discounts. Monthly wages will be issued according to the living index published for April. It has now been decided that this month's wages should be issued according to the living index published for this month. The issuance method is as follows: For yarn factories that issue wages four times a month, the first, second, and third times will be issued according to the previous month's index. When the fourth wage is issued (usually on the 30th of the month), the index for this month has already been published, and the full amount that should be issued will be paid according to the current month's index.</p>
<h3>Rice Purchase Dispute on Huanlong Road; Eight Dou of White Rice Confiscated</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At the Jufeng Rice Store at the entrance of Xiaotaoyuan Alley on Huanlong Road, white rice sold by the underwriting social bureau was purchased by a crowd of 500 to 600 residents at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Upon hearing this, the Changshu District Police Sub-Bureau dispatched police officers to the scene to maintain order, lining up and numbering people to purchase rice in an orderly manner. By 2:30 PM, more than 370 numbers had been sold (one dou per number, priced at 16,000 yuan). The store clerk claimed that the rice had been sold out. At that time, more than 100 people who had already been numbered had not been able to buy rice, so they started arguing and broke into the store, finding more than eight dou of white rice remaining. The crowd believed that the store had deducted low-priced rice, so they sent the rice to the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau to request punishment. The Food Section stated that the matter was related to the judiciary and did not accept it. The crowd then discussed donating the rice to a charitable organization.</p>
<h3>Secret Gold and Dollar Trading Case; Chen Ke's Trial Concluded; Chen Xianyou et al. Released on Bail</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Chen Ke, from Shantou, Guangdong. Accused of opening the Taixing Zhan, secretly buying and selling gold and US dollars, and operating a bank and money shop, in violation of the Emergency Economic Measures Plan. The case was heard in the criminal court of the local court yesterday. The defendant argued: (1) Pledging 10,000 US dollars for 100 million legal tender is not circulation and does not conflict with the Emergency Economic Measures Plan. (2) The defendant's Taixing Zhan does not have deposit and withdrawal transactions, and cannot be regarded as a bank, which does not comply with the provisions of Article 7 of the plan. The court is requested to rule that the defendant is innocent. After the debate, Judge Zhai Jiaxiao ordered that the case be sentenced at 2:00 PM on the 23rd.</p>
<p>[Another report] On the 7th of this month, the municipal authorities, based on a tip, cracked down on a massive gold black market trading organization in the loft of a certain pharmacy, arresting the perpetrators Chen Xianyou, Chen Xianshu, Wang Keshu, and Shi Xiangshi, and seizing 36 gold bars and a small gold ingot. The case file was transferred to the local prosecutor's office yesterday afternoon for investigation on charges of disrupting financial order. After interrogation by the prosecutor's office, the defendants were ordered to be released on bail, and the stolen gold bars, ingots, and checks were temporarily handed over to the Central Bank vault for safekeeping.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Kerosene Control; Monthly Reporting of Allocation Quantities</h3>
<p>In order to control the price of kerosene, the Public Utilities Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives from Texaco, Asiatic Petroleum Company, and Mobil Oil Company yesterday morning to discuss future kerosene allocation matters. It was decided that the three companies would report the kerosene sold to various kerosene merchants to the Social Affairs Bureau on a monthly basis for control purposes. According to reporters, the second phase of kerosene for this year will be distributed in the near future, at which time the price of kerosene is expected to decrease. At the current price, each catty has risen to 2,200 yuan. The reason is that the Import Management Committee restricts the purchase of foreign exchange, and the kerosene shipped to the city cannot be purchased due to foreign exchange restrictions, and all of them are stored in warehouses, resulting in soaring kerosene prices. After this distribution, the Social Affairs Bureau will convene all relevant parties to discuss and determine the price of kerosene and control it to prevent price increases.</p>

<h3>Speaker Pan Advises Jiao Tong University Students; Denies Calling the School's Students "Thugs"</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the Zhonghua Times published a news item: "Jiao Tong University Student Uprising, Another Complication, Will Sue Pan Gongzhan." It was said that when the school's students were waiting for the train at the North Station, Pan had told the students that "you are all thugs," which caused public outrage and they would file a lawsuit with the court for defamation. Since the matter was sudden, reporters from this newspaper specially visited Pan at his residence yesterday morning, and he gave the following statement:</p>
<p>After the Jiao Tong University's protect-the-school movement decided to petition in Beijing, I was firmly invited by Mayor Wu and President Wu to assist in advising them. I have always expressed sympathy for their legitimate and reasonable school protection movement, as long as it does not exceed the scope of protecting the school. I have repeatedly stated that if there are no violations of the rules, it will definitely gain the sympathy and support of society. Conversely, if the actions violate the rules and are sufficient to disrupt public order or obstruct traffic, then I can represent the citizens and ask Mayor Wu to take appropriate action. Also, if unfortunately there are any riots, the local authorities should force a prevention to protect the safety of the majority of citizens. At that time, I never referred to the school's students as "thugs." Mayor Wu, President Wu, and the station staff at the scene all heard this and can testify to it. Therefore, if Jiao Tong University students do have the so-called lawsuit, it is not worth a knowing person's smile.</p>
<h3>Retired Chinese Employees of the Public Works Department Petition the Municipal Government Again; Angering the Mayor, Who Reprimands Them Sternly</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] At 4:00 PM yesterday, former retired Chinese employees of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, again supporting the elderly and carrying the young, totaling about 700 people, went to the City Hall to request Mayor Wu to give a concrete answer to the method and date of issuing retirement pay. The front of the City Hall was once again in chaos. The retired Chinese employees, dissatisfied with the Mayor's response, rushed into the back door of the City Hall Square. Fortunately, the police worked hard to maintain order and no accidents occurred.</p>
<p>According to representatives of the retired Chinese employees: When they visited Mayor Wu on the 29th of last month, the Mayor promised in person that if there was still no news from the central government on the issuance of retirement pay after two weeks, he would go to Nanjing to wait. Two weeks later (the 5th of this month), the representatives visited the Mayor again, and the Mayor immediately stated: I have just returned from Nanjing and am about to convene you for a discussion. And said: If there is no reply by Friday (16th), I will send a telegram to urge them.</p>
<p>Three Demands Made</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Mayor's last agreed date. The retired Chinese employees gathered in Children's Park at 2:00 PM, supporting the elderly and carrying the young, and sent Shen Yaoting, Wu Xucheng, Liu Shaoqing, Lu Jiandong, Li Junting, Ma Zongyi, Chen Tingju, and other seven people as representatives to visit the Mayor at the City Hall. They immediately made three demands: (1) Determine the date of issuance. (2) What standard is the multiple based on? (3) Is the approved 20 billion yuan for issuance a temporary relief fund, or the entire retirement pay? The Mayor's reply was: (1) It will be issued as soon as the accounts are settled. (2) The multiple will be based on the salary of municipal government employees. (3) It will be known after the announcement when the funds are issued. The representatives asked: Is the treatment of municipal government employees calculated according to the adjustment method? The Mayor replied: I will send another telegram to Nanjing to inquire.</p>
<p>A Din of Voices</p>
<p>After the representatives withdrew from the City Hall, they returned to Children's Park to convey the Mayor's reply. The crowd expressed dissatisfaction and rushed to the City Hall Square, causing a din of voices, demanding that the Mayor answer in public. The Mayor only agreed to meet with the representatives. When the representatives met the Mayor again, the Mayor sternly reprimanded the representatives for not leading the crowd to make trouble at the City Hall. At that time, the crowd broke in, but the Mayor left the government office without being able to meet with the crowd because he had other important matters. Until 5:30 PM, the crowd left without getting any results. They agreed to go to the City Hall again next Monday (19th) to negotiate.</p>

Later, many people gave speeches. After the family members gave their replies, the ceremony was completed.

<p>[Our Report] The city government has decided to directly allocate rice to schools, factories, charitable organizations, and prisons in the city for daily consumption. The measures for this rice allocation program, drafted by the Social Affairs Bureau, were approved at yesterday's municipal meeting. The measures are as follows: (1) Boarding students of public universities, boarding faculty and staff of private universities, boarding students of private middle schools, and faculty and staff of private primary and secondary schools should submit rosters with applications to the Municipal Education Bureau for review (at two dou per person per month). After review, the Education Bureau will submit the applications and approved rosters to the Social Affairs Bureau, which will notify the schools to remit funds to the designated bank and obtain rice withdrawal certificates, which can be used to withdraw rice from the Shanghai General Rice Warehouse of the Ministry of Food. (Private primary and secondary schools are limited to those registered with the Education Bureau.)</p>
<p>(2) Factories wishing to entrust rice allocation should prepare rosters jointly with their factory unions, together with applications, and submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau (at two dou per person per month, half for child laborers). After review and approval, the Social Affairs Bureau will notify the factories to remit funds to the designated bank and obtain rice withdrawal certificates, which can be used to withdraw rice from the Shanghai General Rice Warehouse of the Ministry of Food. Factories are limited to those registered with the Social Affairs Bureau and holding factory registration certificates issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the Social Affairs Bureau. Those without certificates may use receipts from the Social Affairs Bureau as proof. (3) Charitable organizations and institutions housing refugees should prepare rosters and submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau for review and approval, and then proceed according to items 1 and 2 (at two dou per person per month, one dou for children).

According to Director Wu yesterday, the police bureau's investigation of shantytown residents throughout the city shows a total of over 200,000 people. A portion of these may not meet the standards of poverty and will not be within the scope of allocation. Once the rice purchase certificates for the poor are produced, they will be distributed through the district offices and should be implemented within this month.</p>
<h3>Free Opening of Nine Parks; Ticket Prices Increased for Five Parks</h3>

<h3>Canned Food Industry Encounters Three Major Difficulties</h3>
<p>Currently, there are 15 canned food factories that have joined the trade guild. The industry's production has been greatly reduced compared to pre-war levels due to unresolved issues with tinplate, sugar, and coal. If the black market for tinplate is not eradicated and the allocation quota from the Transportation Control Committee is not increased, the industry will face a crisis of reduced or suspended work in two months when inventories are depleted. Other important raw materials, such as sugar and coal, are also in short supply. The sugar company's allocation is less than one-tenth of the monthly requirement, leading to high costs and affecting sales. The allocation of coal blocks is also far from the actual demand. Therefore, the canned food industry is currently facing three major difficulties. The industry is currently appealing to the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, the Industrial Collection Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for assistance.</p>
<h3>Resolutely Safeguard National Aviation Rights; Restrict the Water Transport Brigade's Ships to Transport Relief Supplies Only; The Aviation Federation Passes 62 Proposals</h3>

Yang Guanbei, executive director of the Shanghai Shipping Association, served as chairman. Li Jinglu, director of the Maritime Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, came from Beijing to attend and delivered a five-point speech on behalf of the Ministry of Communications: (1) The shipping industry previously lacked coordination, and it is hoped that this will be strengthened in the future. (2) The government attaches great importance to the issue of compensation and will obtain compensation of 500,000 tons of ships in the short term. At the same time, the government is paying close attention to restricting the development of Japanese overseas shipping to reduce the threat to world peace. (3) Organize collective marine insurance to protect the lives and interests of passengers. In the past, marine insurance was handled by foreign insurance companies, and we should eliminate the outflow of foreign exchange. (4) It is hoped that shipping facilities will be improved. The government will actively inspect the equipment of ships in the future. (5) The government will complete the overall plan for the shipping industry in stages. The most important of these is to reorganize the service capacity of seafarers to make them suitable for the increasing number of ships. In addition, Director Li hinted that the Ministry of Communications will convene a national shipping conference in Beijing after the official establishment of the Shipping Industry Federation to bring together shipping experts from across the country to discuss the future development plan of China's new shipping industry. Subsequently, representatives from various regions reported on the recovery and current situation of the shipping industry. Zhong Shandao, director-general of the Civil Ship Wartime Loss Compensation Committee, reported on the shipping industry's views on compensation ships from Japan. At noon, Xu, general manager of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, hosted a special banquet at the Guobin Hotel to entertain representatives from various regions and President Fan.</p>
<p>Key Measures; Ten Recommendations</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM, the third meeting continued on the 14th floor of the International Hotel. Sixty-two proposals were passed, the most important of which were ten key measures for the government to implement current shipping proposed by the Shanghai Shipping Association: (1) Resolutely safeguard aviation rights, support the domestic shipping industry, promptly and forcibly acquire foreign shipping assets in China, and strictly restrict the ships of the Water Transport Brigade of the Executive Yuan to transport relief supplies only and strictly prohibit the transport of commercial goods. (2) Quickly compensate for the wartime requisition, blockade, destruction, and seizure of domestic merchant ships, and negotiate for 500,000 tons of Japanese ships as compensation. (3) Various ships, shipbuilding materials, and other materials needed for the construction of the shipping industry obtained by the government, city federations, or friendly countries should be distributed to the shipping industry using long-term (at least ten years) payment methods. (4) Determine the national commercial port reorganization and construction plan, with Shanghai as the major port in the East. All confiscated enemy and puppet properties and acquired foreign wharves and warehouses should be provided for the common use of all shipping merchants, and the original wharves and warehouses of the Chinese people that were occupied should be returned quickly. (5) National banks should provide sufficient loans for the construction and operation funds of the shipping industry. All ships and other shipping assets that have been inspected and qualified by the maritime authorities may be mortgaged at 80% of the market value to support the development of the shipping industry. (6) Foreign exchange should be approved for the purchase of ships and the purchase of essential foreign materials for shipping. (7) Priority should be given to the sufficient allocation of oil and coal for ships, and the shipping industry should be allowed to purchase and transport from the production areas to maintain the operational efficiency of water transportation. (8) Coordinate the allocation of shipping routes. For shipping routes that are suitable for supply and demand or oversupplied, the increase of ships should be restricted. For shipping routes that are in short supply, the increase of ships should be encouraged through shipping bonuses and other methods, and scheduled shipping should be encouraged so that there are regular and close schedules on major shipping routes. (9) Freight and passenger fares on each shipping route should be changed to the method of peer negotiation. The local industry associations should adjust according to the price index or the main shipping costs (such as fuel costs, repair costs, crew wages, etc.). (10) Simplify the inspection of ships by military and police agencies in various places, effectively prevent various harassments, and reduce the suffering of travelers.</p>
<p>The second is three urgent measures for reorganizing the shipping industry proposed by the Shanghai Association: (1) Implement comprehensive joint operations in various places, concentrate the strength of the industry, and strive for transportation convenience and operational economy. (2) Freight and passenger fares and other business matters that should be consistent within the industry should be decided by the association, and all members of the industry must abide by them and strictly prohibit price reductions or any form of disguised price reductions. Violators will have their membership revoked and various effective methods will be adopted to correct them. (3) Pay attention to navigation safety and maritime responsibilities, enrich the ship's life-saving and fire-fighting equipment, implement hull and passenger accident insurance, eliminate old and dilapidated ships, ships without fixed passenger quotas shall not carry passengers, and cargo shall not exceed the load line to maintain navigation safety and reduce their own responsibilities. Finally, temporary motions were passed: (1) Request the government to add two seats for legislators and three seats for national representatives from the shipping industry. (2) It is recommended that the government enact maritime laws and regulations and establish a maritime court. After the meeting, Director Li said that the Ministry of Communications has expressed acceptance of the shipping industry's request to restore and adjust freight rates and is continuing to research solutions in addition to the subsidy issue. The association is scheduled to hold a cocktail party at 3 pm today on the Zhongxing Wheel to conclude the meeting.</p>

The case was heard in the District Court yesterday. Judge Ling Yuanqing stated that the case is within the jurisdiction of Qingpu County.

<h3>Elementary School Teacher Defrauds Uncle for Wife's Employment</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Shen Tianzhang, a teacher at Zhanghuabang Tiantong Elementary School, wanted to treat guests because his wife was introduced to work in a factory but lacked funds.

Yang believed him to be true. Shen asked him for 150,000 yuan, falsely claiming it was for the purchase of food allocated to public teachers, and another 500,000 yuan, falsely claiming it was for entertaining guests. Afterwards, Yang discovered that he had been deceived and reported the information to the police bureau.

Because he wanted to find a job for his wife, he had no choice but to resort to this tactic.</p>

<h3>Historical U.N. Relief Mustang and Cattle Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The UN Relief Agency arrived here yesterday afternoon on the "Emilius Victory" with a chestnut Morgan stallion and 668 head of cattle. The cattle and stallion left the United States on March 27 and were kept in specially built pens on the deck and in two-layer holds in comfortable conditions. Along the way, in addition to 200 tons of fodder, there were also two veterinarians and livestock handlers to take care of everything. The ship arrived west of the Panama Canal in mid-April, where its boiler pipe suddenly broke. It was towed to San Pedro for repairs, where the cattle and stallion were able to feast on California spring grass for two weeks before re-embarking.</p>
<p>The herd includes 65 male calves, mostly Holstein and Shorthorn breeds. On the way to China, the cattle were generally healthy except for a very small number who were slightly ill.</p>
<p>This stallion is the 250,000th animal transported by the UN Relief Agency for agricultural recovery programs in recipient countries, and also the last one, and the only horse transported to China by the agency, and therefore has historical value. The horse will be transported to the interior after vaccination, and the cattle will also be distributed to the interior of China.</p>
<h3>Brokers' Guarantee and Evidence Money to Be Paid in US Dollar Bonds; Guild Discusses Methods Overnight</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Brokers Association of the Stock Exchange received an order from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday afternoon that all guarantee money and deferred delivery money to be paid by brokers must be calculated and paid in US dollar bonds at 70% of their value from the date of receipt of the order. The Brokers Association considered the matter to be of great importance and immediately convened a meeting of brokers that evening. Chairman Chen Jingmin of the association reported the contents of the order from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and discussed how to handle it. The brokers present believed that the guarantee money of 50 million yuan, which was originally 20,000 in cash and 30 million in securities, now all had to be converted into US dollar bonds, which was difficult to turn around in a short time. Moreover, deferred transactions were completely buying and selling on behalf of customers, and it was difficult to guarantee whether customers had US dollar bonds to pay as evidence money. If brokers were to advance the funds, they did not have such positions. They all advocated that there must be a proper solution, otherwise there would be drastic changes when the market opened tomorrow morning, and how to deal with this loss. The discussion continued until about 11:00 PM without a result. The chairman then announced that the meeting would be temporarily adjourned, and the executive directors would gather to discuss it further. However, the meeting of the executive directors was also prolonged and undecided. The attending representatives of the brokers saw that they had been waiting for a long time and sent people to inquire, only to learn that Chen had left. The public was quite angry and decided that the executive directors and the attending representatives would hire a car to the residence of General Manager Wang Zhixin to petition, hoping to obtain a solution. Because a decision could not be made today, if the market were to open rashly, the market price would likely undergo a great change.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to Wang Zhixin, General Manager of the Stock Exchange, because the matter is of great importance, it must be decided after being passed by the board of directors and supervisors. However, the brokers believed that the situation was urgent and could not wait any longer. Therefore, at 3:00 AM this morning, nine executive directors, together with Wang Zhixing and three representatives of the brokers, went to the residence of the chairman of the board of directors to discuss. As of 4:00 AM, there was still no result. However, according to Du, it is still advisable to open the market today.</p>
<h3>Pan American Airlines US-China Route to Open on June 3</h3>

<h3>President Cha Liangjian of the District Court Speaks; Trial of Foreign Cases is Always Fair and Careful; Improving Prison Facilities is Being Pursued</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Recently, the Millard's Review criticized our country's prison system and the District Court's handling of foreign cases. For this reason, the reporter visited President Cha Liangjian of the District Court to inquire about the recent situation of the court and the improvement of prisons. He gave a talk as follows: (1) The judicial aspect of China is striving for improvement and has made obvious progress. American jurist Pound (R. Pound) once commented on China's judicial system and legal education, saying: "The Chinese code is very complete, and it has many significant advantages that can be compared with any modern code." (2) The District Court accepted 8,911 civil cases and 14,135 criminal cases in 1946, including 316 civil cases involving foreigners and 368 criminal cases involving foreigners. All trials were conducted in a spirit of fairness and an objective attitude. (3) Several important foreign-related cases, including the case of the American Rogers hurting a bookseller, the case of Lai Lingnai instigating injury to death, and the case of Macebo violating economic emergency measures, were all handled impartially, striving to avoid injustice and leniency, and imposing punishments with extreme caution. (4) Regarding the guarantee system, according to the Civil Procedure Law, the court may order a creditor to provide cash collateral before ordering a provisional seizure or provisional execution. In addition, those who are suspected of committing a crime and apply for suspension of detention should submit a guarantee or a corresponding amount of guarantee, which is also stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Law. In fact, China's legal provisions are modeled after foreign countries. (5) Prison improvement issues: Shanghai originally had two major modern prisons, Huaxinjing and Caohejing, which could accommodate more than 13,000 people, but they were destroyed in the war. The current prisons have small capacity and are inevitably crowded. However, at a time when the national economy is extremely difficult, Shanghai prisons have successively approved the allocation of huge sums of money for repairs, which also proves the hard work of the judicial authorities. As for hygiene, much attention is also paid to it. Prisons have hospitals, and prisoners are vaccinated from time to time, and drugs such as DDT are used for disinfection and pest control. Therefore, prisoner illnesses have been greatly reduced. Other facilities are still far from ideal and will be improved in the future in order to achieve perfection. After the post-war recovery, everything is waiting to be done. The fact that our prison facilities can make progress in difficult times is understood by Chinese and foreigners alike. It should be known that Chinese courts and prisons are still in a period of striving for improvement. Regardless of Chinese or foreigners, anyone who can contribute well-intentioned opinions to this goal will be humbly received to the extent possible.</p>

<h3>Student Unrest Spreads in Beiping Various Colleges and Universities Brewing Strikes</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Beiping, 16th dispatch] Student unrest is spreading throughout the ancient capital. Tsinghua, Peking University, Yenching University, Peiyang, the Railway Institute, and the Teachers College have all decided to strike or are brewing strikes. Details are as follows: (1) Tsinghua held a student assembly late last night to demand an increase in public funds and to call for peace. It was resolved to strike for one day on the 17th. Some students posted notices today expressing their disagreement, stating that the responsibility for the civil war should be shared by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and should not be solely blamed on the government. However, they were unable to prevent the strike. (2) At Peking University and Yenching University, some students are brewing strikes all day today in response to Tsinghua. More than half of the students in the three colleges of liberal arts, science, and law at Peking University have signed a petition. The vote will be announced tonight, and it is likely to pass based on the situation. Yenching University, located in the suburbs, has reportedly decided to strike for one day on the 17th as well. (3) The Peiyang division in Peiping continued its strike today. Acting President Jin Wenshu persuaded them without success and has returned to Tianjin to ask for instructions from the Ministry of Education. There has been no reply yet. (4) The Railway Institute continued its strike today. Yesterday, it held a "burning of the plaque ceremony" and burned the plaque of the "National Railway Management College." From today onwards, it will hang the old Jiaotong University plaque and decided to send two representatives to Beijing to petition. (5) At the Teachers College, wall newspapers were filled yesterday and today advocating the restoration of the original name of Normal University and brewing a strike in the near future as a means of making demands.</p>
<h3>33 Middle Schools in Jiangsu Province Petition Demanding Adjustment of Teachers' Salaries</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 16th dispatch] Representatives from 33 middle schools in the province went to the provincial government and the education department on the 15th to petition, putting forward three demands: (1) Adjust salaries. Jiangsu should treat all areas equally, regardless of region. (2) Increase the average base salary of provincial school colleagues to 260 yuan.

<h3>Responding to the Strike at National Central University Jinling University Students Petitioned Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th dispatch] Students at private Jinling University, in response to the strike and petition movement at National Central University, went on strike on the afternoon of the 15th and petitioned the Ministry of Education and the Executive Yuan on the 16th, putting forward five demands: (1) Increase the supplementary food allowance for publicly funded students to 100,000 yuan per month according to the cost of living index; (2) Convert all semi-publicly funded and self-funded students to publicly funded students; (3) Maintain education funding at 15% of the total budget; (4) Increase funding for private schools; (5) Immediately stop the civil war. When the entire body marched to the Ministry of Education to petition in the morning, Vice Minister Hang Liwu said: The publicly funded system is a wartime system. After the war, the number of old publicly funded students has been reduced by 30%. Currently, there are 130,000 publicly funded students in the country. This year's education funding has been reduced, so the first two items cannot be done. The third item is a general problem. The Ministry of Education gives the most subsidies to Jinling University for the fourth item, and it is impossible to increase it further. The Ministry of Education cannot answer the fifth item. The students were dissatisfied with the answer and questioned him in groups, but they could not get any results. In the afternoon, they went to the Executive Yuan to petition and wanted to see President Zhang. At the same time, they sent representatives to contact Vice President Wang Yunwu. Wang Yunwu came downstairs to speak to all the students. At that time, the students had all entered the gate of the Executive Yuan office building and sat on the ground. Some people had climbed the stairs and gone to the second floor. Wang said: The conversion of semi-publicly funded and self-funded students to publicly funded students cannot be considered at present. As for increasing the supplementary food allowance, a temporary political affairs meeting was convened this morning to discuss it and decided to increase it to 48,000 yuan. It does not seem like much for each person, but it is a very large number for all students. At the same time, it was decided to adjust it every three months in the future. The conversion of non-publicly funded students to publicly funded students cannot be approved. After Wang finished answering, the students were dissatisfied and criticized him again, believing that Wang should give a satisfactory answer immediately. Although Wang said, "I am the Vice President of the Executive Yuan," he was booed by the students. Wang left the hospital for a meeting, and Secretary-General Gan continued to talk, telling them that "The economic cafeteria run by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) at Jinling University was originally scheduled to close. The Executive Yuan has decided to contact the UNRRA personnel to continue running it to give students special relief until the end of this semester." The rest was the same as Wang's reply, and there was still no result. At about six o'clock, the staff of the Executive Yuan had dinner, and the students crowded into the cafeteria, usurping the host's role, eating and then leaving. Student representatives, principals, and professors continued to talk with Secretaries-General Gan and Pu until 9:40, and it was agreed that: "(1) Negotiate with UNRRA to expand the economic cafeteria, currently guaranteed by the school for loan management; (2) The conversion of semi-publicly funded and self-funded students to publicly funded students will be decided after contacting the various schools." Only then did the entire body leave the Executive Yuan, and they will continue the strike on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Second Session of Self-Funded Overseas Students Will Make a Collective Petition Demanding Passports and Foreign Exchange Settlement for Early Departure</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper] The National Second Self-Funded Overseas Students Association, organized by 1,221 students from the second session of self-funded overseas students, was officially established in Nanjing on the 14th. Twenty-two representatives were sent from various places, including six from Shanghai, three each from Nanjing and Chongqing, two each from Beiping, Guangzhou, and Kunming, and one each from Hankou, Xi'an, and Chengdu. It was resolved to organize the National Students' General Association, which has a board of directors. Fifteen directors were elected by the representatives from various places to Beijing. Seven executive directors were elected: Zhao Yihua, Ding Zemin, Ling Shuang, Zhang Shengxiang, Xu Li, Chen Guozhong, and Li Hengyi. Zhao Yihua also served as chairman, and Ding Zemin and Ling Shuang served as vice-chairmen. The headquarters of the General Association is temporarily located at the YMCA in Baixianqiao, Shanghai, and the Nanjing office is located at No. 143 Zhongshan East Road in Beijing. After its establishment, the association intends to request the government to immediately open passports and settle foreign exchange in accordance with the resolutions of the Legislative Yuan, with 3350 as the standard, so that students can go abroad for research in the shortest possible period. The association also stated that if the government still does not have a concrete solution to this problem, it intends to gather students from all over the country to go to Beijing again to make a collective petition to the government to achieve their goals.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Held a Temporary Political Affairs Meeting Yesterday Decided That the Supplementary Food Allowance for Students Is 48,000 Yuan Per Month</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 16th dispatch] National Central University students will suspend their strike for five days from the 16th. The reason is that Executive Yuan Vice President Wang replied that their demands would be discussed at the Political Affairs Conference. Therefore, there is no practical effect in insisting on a strike before the Political Affairs Conference. They will resume classes after a satisfactory result from the Political Affairs Conference. However, although the 16th was nominally a suspension of the strike, it was actually still in a state of suspension of classes. The Executive Yuan held a temporary political affairs meeting on the 16th and decided that the supplementary food allowance for students would be 48,000 yuan per month, which is still far from the students' demands. The National Central University Student Union convened a department and discipline conference again that evening and decided on the actions for the 17th. The association issued a "Declaration for Requesting an Increase in Public Funds Again" on the 16th. The content roughly stated: According to the replies from Vice President Wang and Minister Zhu to the five demands, there are two points: (1) The country is currently facing extreme economic difficulties, and it is really difficult to increase education funding. (2) A supplementary food allowance of 48,000 yuan per month is enough to maintain life. However, the demand for 100,000 yuan is based on government estimates because past education funding was extremely pitiful, accounting for only 4.85% of the total budget, which also included party and group expenses. Now, parties and groups are no longer allowed to draw from the education fund, and according to the constitution, education funding should be increased to 15% of the total budget. This increase in funding includes students' meal expenses.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th dispatch] Some newspapers published that Vice President Wang of the Executive Yuan said to the students of National Central University yesterday that he had promised to lend 50,000 yuan to each publicly funded student for supplementary food. A senior official of the Executive Yuan recently issued the following statement to reporters: "Vice President Wang did not say this during yesterday's conversation. He only promised to submit the petition to the Executive Yuan meeting for a decision. If funds are indeed urgently needed, half a month can be borrowed from the amount that the government has already approved."</p>
<h3>Students of the Social Education College May Respond to National Central University</h3>

<p>[Our newspaper] Students at Datong University in this city are demanding that the school: (1) Cancel all unreasonable fees, (2) Improve the student economic cafeteria, (3) Increase various school facilities, (4) Cancel restrictions on the activities of the student union.

<p>[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 15th] Regarding the Ministry of Education's handling of the Jiaotong University turmoil, a written statement was issued by the spokesperson on the 14th. Concerning the section stating "the Ministry approved the merger of the Marine Engineering Department into the Naval Architecture Department, renamed the Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering Department, still under the College of Engineering," the spokesperson stated on the 15th that it was an error in the draft. The original intent was "to change the Marine Engineering Department to the Marine Engineering Department, under the school's College of Engineering, and in connection with the Mechanical Engineering Department." The reporter hereby makes the above correction.</p>

<p>In your newspaper's May 12th edition, page 5, there was a news item about Jiaotong University students petitioning in Nanjing. It mentioned that National Central University had received two billion yuan in winter clothing expenses for faculty and staff, which is not consistent with the facts. Upon investigation, this school's faculty and staff sent a letter last December requesting the allocation of winter clothing expenses, which was submitted to the ministry and then to the academy. However, Ministry of Education's instruction No. 4566 Gao dated January 29th, 36th year of the Republic, relayed the Executive Yuan's directive No. 200 Yi of January 7th, stating that the request was unprecedented and could not be approved, and instructed notification of this.

<h3>The Expedition Wheel Team Displays Its Power; Ren Yu Succumbs for the Third Time; 55 to 29 Shows an Overwhelming Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Luoyang Expedition Wheel Basketball Team won against Ren Yu three times. Last night, in their second match after arriving in Shanghai, they won again with a score of 55 to 29. The score was 28 to 15 at halftime, with the guest team leading. The Expedition Wheel team performed even better, and while Ren Yu was able to resist at the beginning, they soon fell behind.

The Expedition Wheel team started with Cai Zhongqiang, Liu Zhengjun, Yu Ruizhang, Tu Wenlong, and Wang Binghuan, while Ren Yu started with Yao Wenyi, Shen Pengju, Wang Huaiting, Xu Zhongji, and Wu Xinyun.

Yao scored first, followed by Xu Zhongji, but the Expedition Wheel team continued to press. Yu Ruizhang and Cai Zhongqiang continued to score smoothly, and Ren Yu was unable to recover. By the time Cai Zhongqiang scored a reverse shot, the first half ended, with the Expedition Wheel team leading 28-15.</p>

<h3>Rising Star Female Athletes of Ji City</h3>
<p>Visiting Two Young Ladies Who Broke National Records</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Aviation Dispatch] Jinan Private Fan Women's High School recently held its spring sports meet, where students Xu Meilin and Wang Canhua broke national records in the high jump, javelin, and shot put. Our reporter made a special trip to visit. It turns out that the school is a well-known church girls' school in Jinan, founded nearly twenty years ago. The school building was originally located inside the city, but later moved to a suburb two miles outside the east gate. The buildings are beautiful and the environment is quiet. Although the sports field is not very large, it has all the necessary sports equipment for women. The school stipulates that all students must live on campus, so they all pay widespread attention to sports during their spare time, achieving balanced development. Physical Education Director Wang Jingbo has been working at the school for a total of thirteen years. This long-term leadership and training is the reason for such achievements, which is no accident.</p>
<p>When the reporter visited, Priest Ke Shude (foreigner) and Wang Jiuxian introduced us to the two young ladies:</p>
<p>Miss Xu Meilin, from Zichuan, is lively and generous. She is quite tall and is a typical northern woman. She is only nineteen years old this year. She is recovering from a minor illness and has not fully regained her strength. According to her, she had an older brother who loved sports since she was a child, and he set up a high jump stand at home. Under the influence of her brother, she developed an interest in sports. In this school's spring sports meet, her high jump score was 1.40 meters, breaking the previous national record of 1.355 meters held by Miss Zhu Tianzhen, also from Shandong. She threw the javelin 29.50 meters, breaking the previous record of 28.55 meters from the previous National Games.</p>
<p>Wang Canhua, from Taian, is twenty years old. From her appearance, one can tell that she is physically strong and worthy of being a standard athlete. She has considerable strength. Her shot put score in this competition was 11.90 meters, breaking the previous national record of 10.35 meters. In addition, according to her teacher, Wang Jingbo, her discus score was 30 meters, which is also quite close to the national record of 30.05 meters.</p>
<p>The Jinan City Games are scheduled to be held on the 16th and 17th of this month, and they will all participate at that time. The pity is that due to the high cost of javelins, the event will not be included in the competition this year due to lack of funding. However, they all hope to have a chance to show their skills at the National Games held in Shanghai during the Double Ten Festival. They are at the peak of their youth and are in their second year of high school this year. They are striving for excellence, and their future is promising! (Our Correspondent Li Tian)</p>

<h3>Minister of Finance and Central Bank Official Talk - Foreign Exchange Lengthening Rumors are All False - Cannot Add More Stimulus During Price Fluctuations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch of the 16th] Rumors circulated in Shanghai that foreign exchange would be adjusted. The reporter specifically visited Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun, who said that these were purely rumors spread by speculators and were not true.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been widespread rumors that foreign exchange will be lengthened, and the securities market has rebounded. According to a Central Bank official, there is no consideration being given to lengthening foreign exchange at this time. Speculators deliberately spread rumors in order to take advantage of the situation and reap huge profits. It is always their old trick. If you don't keep a cool head and fall for their scheme, you have only yourself to blame. Sources also revealed that in the current situation of turmoil, the government should seek stability. If foreign exchange changes again amidst current price fluctuations, prices will be further stimulated. There have been some lessons in the past, and it is not appropriate to act rashly because it involves too much. The government has other ways to remedy the export business.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Recently, the market has been widely rumored that the exchange rate will be adjusted to 25,000 yuan. As a result, all commodities have rebounded. The reporter visited the export industry and related financial industries to seek the opinions of various authorities. The following is a summary: (1) Given the sharp rise in prices and the rampant black market exchange rates in recent months, if the US dollar exchange rate is raised to 25,000 yuan, it would not be considered too high. (2) The cost of imported goods is now calculated based on black market exchange rates. (3) The export trade has almost completely stopped. Although the government has recently planned to purchase, if the exchange rate can be raised to a suitable number, exports will be more active. (4) Since the foreign exchange adjustment in February, remittances from overseas Chinese have increased. However, because the black market exchange rate is twice as high, most of the remittances have flowed into the black market. If this can be changed in time, a considerable amount of remittances can be pulled back. The above are all different points of view, and they are recorded for exploration.</p>
<h3>Speculative Funds Vigorously Absorbing, Chinese Stocks Continue to Surge to Limit</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks saw new bulls participating in absorbing chips. The dark market for Yong Yarn was nearing the daily limit. Northern speculative funds were vigorously absorbing, and 80-90% of the entire market reached the daily limit. With soaring commodity prices and the sharp decline of Hong Kong-Shanghai Power, the stock market easily sparked a buying frenzy.</p>
<p>The morning opened briskly, with Liann and Mayer being the first to hit the limit. After Yong Yarn opened, No. 188 had some selling, dropping back to 6440 yuan. Nos. 14, 112, 31, 77, 355, 222, 102, 197 came in, the market was extremely dry, and then it jumped to the daily limit. New Light, Sino-Netherlands, Quanxing, Datong, Rongfeng, Yonggong, Tongyi, Jingfu, New Asia, and Commercial all reached the limit. Nos. 85, 112, 77, 180, 199 then came in again. In the dark market, Yong Yarn was bid up to 6900 yuan. Sino-Netherlands also added 20 yuan in transactions. Nos. 117, 148, 60, 14, 152 were sold off, dropping to 6820 yuan. Nos. 94, 129, 14 came in again and approached the 7000 yuan mark. Nos. 22, 197, 148, 104, 60, 3, 4, 89, 183 sold in succession. At 10:25, it once fell within the limit. Nos. 223, 153, 154, 129, 160 were still eager to buy, rising to 6850 yuan. Nos. 89, 153, 183 sold slightly below the limit again. Nos. 223, 77, 160, 159, 23, 157, 171, 94 continuously bought in. Hong Kong-Shanghai Power narrowed to 16.75 yuan. Near noon, the rebound was significant, with Yong Yarn jumping to over 7100 yuan. Nos. 153, etc. closed out at high prices, and the noon closing retreated to around 7050 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Yong Yarn, Mayer, Yonggong, New Light, and Sino-Netherlands hit the limit. New China and Jingfu rebounded after hitting the limit, each rising by slightly over 10%. For immediate delivery, Yong Yarn, Mayer, Sino-Netherlands, New Light, and Jingfu hit the limit.

Immediate delivery Qin Xing rebounded after hitting the limit, also rising by slightly less than 15%. The rest all hit the limit, and all stocks outside the market rebounded strongly by slightly over 10%.</p>
<p>Unified Bonds Waver</p>
<p>The situation for government bonds yesterday was wavering. Unified Class C opened at 17,000 yuan, retreated from 17,300 yuan to 15,900 yuan, and struggled around 16,500 yuan at noon. Rooms 503 and 552 absorbed, while rooms 360 and 550 sold. Compared to the previous closing, Class A and B rose by 700 yuan, Class D and E rose by 1,000 yuan, and Unified Class C only rose slightly.

<h3>Cotton Cloth Market Situation Strong</h3>
<p>When the cotton cloth market opened yesterday, sentiment was quite weak because the Spinning &amp; Weaving Company's 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was being sold at a loss of 4,000 yuan, Four Gentlemen Gold Seal Yuan Bi Ji at a loss of 2,000 yuan. Other items such as Yuanfu silk and Yuan fine cloth sold by quota were able to be traded with a price increase of 3,000 yuan. Around 11:00, news spread that securities were hitting the limit again and yarn prices continued to rise. Sentiment in the industry changed dramatically, and people rushed to buy additional subscription orders for the Spinning &amp; Weaving Company. Because there were few subscribers the day before, although the Spinning &amp; Weaving Company's Dragon Head fine cloth and Four Gentlemen Yuan Bi Ji were all allocated, the chips were insufficient, and the situation was that demand exceeded supply. As a result, Dragon Head fine cloth rose by 13,000 yuan and Four Gentlemen Yuan Bi Ji by 9,000 yuan, but it was still difficult to replenish. Therefore, the final result was that 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth reached a high of 288,000 yuan, an increase of 15,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other brands such as Five Blessings Blue Chicken Color Ball also increased by 10,000 to 15,600 yuan. Bleached cloth, coarse cloth, Zhigong, Yuan cloth, colored cloth, and Celanese cloth also rose uniformly from 5,600 yuan to over 20,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Industrial Raw Materials Soar</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Industrial raw materials previously rose repeatedly due to the soaring black market exchange rate. Later, due to tight credit and many retail investors unloading, prices softened for a time. However, due to the rise of exchange rate rumors in the past few days, sentiment has firmed, and merchants have competed to absorb caustic soda, bleaching powder, N rosin, soda ash, petroleum jelly, and other items, causing them to soar again.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, international markets have remained eager for soybeans. China is temporarily not exporting in order to adjust domestic supply and demand. However, it is understood that the supply situation of soybeans in various parts of the world is improving, so the international market price of soybeans is expected to remain low.</p>
<p>[Another Report] A batch of soybeans, totaling 4,000 tons, transported by the Central Trust Bureau arrived in Shanghai previously.

However, the Soviet Union has been continuously shipping coal, newsprint, kelp, and other materials to this area for import. It is said that 90% of these materials come from South Sakhalin Island. China has not yet exported any goods to the Soviet Union. The brick tea, raw silk, tung oil, and other materials that China exports to the Soviet Union each year through the Central Trust Bureau are all to repay China's debts to the Soviet Union and have no trade relationship. It is said that these debts will not be fully paid off until 1952. The value of the various materials paid each year is approximately US$7-8 million.</p>

<h3>Government Formulates Purchasing Plan for Export Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The international market prices of major export commodities such as tung oil and bristles have recently been trending downward. Domestic purchasing agents are unable to initiate foreign sales after purchasing, and are therefore slashing prices and dumping, causing international market prices to fall further.</p>
<p>It is now heard that purchasing agents in various places have requested the authorities to purchase these materials in order to adjust the financial situation of grain merchants domestically and then promote foreign sales in a coordinated manner. It is now heard that this request has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and a purchasing plan has been formulated and handed over to the Central Trust Bureau for handling. The Central Trust Bureau is currently studying the steps for its implementation. It is said that the purchasing plan is nationwide.</p>
<h3>Cotton Textile Industry Unwilling to Accept Simplified Examination Rules for Yarn and Cloth Transport to Hankou, Industry Association to Submit Official Document to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for Approval</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to Mr. Wang Qiyu, chairman of the 6th District Cotton Textile Industry Association, the simplified examination rules for yarn and cloth transport to Hankou and the simplified rules for yarn and cloth transshipment certificates promulgated by the Textile Control Committee recently are unacceptable to the cotton textile industry. According to the already promulgated measures for the control of yarn and cloth transportation and sales, the four regions of Northeast China, Hebei, Hankou, and South China are all under controlled transportation and sales, which greatly hinders the development of the cotton textile industry's future. The control of yarn and cloth transshipment is also considered too restrictive. The industry generally believes that it cannot be accepted and requests the authorities to revoke the two new simplified rules that were promulgated recently. He discussed this matter with Mr. Wu, the concurrently serving chairman of the Textile Control Committee, yesterday. It is said that Mr. Wu expressed considerable sympathy for the cotton textile industry's request and asked the industry association to first prepare a document stating the reasons so that it can be forwarded to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Initially Firm, Then Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot yarn market: At the opening, news of a possible exchange rate adjustment boosted sentiment, and many new buyers were searching for goods. The price of 42-count Blue Phoenix reached a high of 12.3 million yuan. However, due to the tight credit of industry players, they instead sold to ease their cash flow, causing prices to fall. Finally, 42-count Blue Phoenix retreated slightly to 11.9 million yuan, only an increase of 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. However, the prices of other 32-count and 16-count yarn fell due to slack demand from towel factories and sock factories.</p>
<p>The Spinning &amp; Weaving Company sold yarn as usual yesterday. Scattered individuals entered and made offers, and the bids were slightly uneven.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Bank of China Offers Cotton and Tobacco Production Loans, Totaling Over 164.6 Billion Yuan, Central Bank Approves Advance Overdraft of 50 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>The Agricultural Bank of China believes that China's cotton-growing areas are quite extensive, but the yield and quality are insufficient to meet current needs, resulting in astonishing numbers of foreign cotton imports. In the future, production should be actively increased and quality improved. This year, in coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's promotion of American cotton, the bank plans to offer American cotton production loans in 12 provinces, including Hebei and Shaanxi. The expected promotion area is 12 million mu, with an average loan of 10,000 yuan per mu, totaling 120 billion yuan. The funds will be used to purchase American cotton seeds, fertilizers, farm implements, pesticides, and to pay wages. It also plans to establish ginning and packaging plants, purchase machinery, and build factory buildings and warehouses, requiring a total of 10.6 billion yuan. Tobacco is also an important raw material, and its production and sales situation is generally similar to that of cotton. Each year, foreign tobacco imports result in significant financial losses. This year, in coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's promotion of American tobacco, the Agricultural Bank of China plans to lend a total of 28.0035 billion yuan for American tobacco production and processing loans. The production portion plans to promote 520,000 mu, lending 15.6 billion yuan (the loan uses are the same as for cotton production loans). For the processing portion, it plans to lend 1.5 billion yuan for repairing drying barns, 10.9 billion yuan for coal for flue-curing, and 35 million yuan for building demonstration drying barns. The above cotton and tobacco production loans total 164.635 billion yuan. It is now learned that the Agricultural Bank of China, facing a shortage of funds, has submitted a request to the Joint Treasury for approval to re-mortgage to the Central Bank. The case has been approved, and an advance overdraft of 50 billion yuan has been authorized. The locations and amounts of the Agricultural Bank of China's overdrafted funds are listed below: Chongqing 1.1 billion, Hankou 6.4 billion, Changsha 1.4 billion, Guiyang 200 million, Shanghai 7.8 billion, Fuzhou 1.4 billion, Nanchang 2.1 billion, Hangzhou 5.4 billion, Wuhu 4.5 billion, Zhengzhou 10.7 billion, Qingdao 1.1 billion, Tianjin 1.3 billion, Xi'an 6 billion, Taiyuan 600 million, totaling 50 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal Market Declines for Several Days, Only White Coal Lumps Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Coal market: Bituminous coal sales remain sluggish, the market is quiet, and market prices are hovering on a downward trend. According to a telegram from a colleague in Hankou who went to purchase white coal lumps, although the market price of white coal is low, the inventory of high-grade goods such as Jiaozuo lumps and Laolong lumps is also low. Purchasers are only transporting small quantities of Pingxiang coke and Lantian coke. Therefore, although the coal market has been declining rapidly in recent days, only white coal lumps remain firm and stable, because there is no spot goods available from the production area.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Longjing Firm and Strong</h3>
<p>The Yangzhuang tea market, which has been overcast for many days, has still not shown any signs of dawn in the face of bleak buying interest. Sentiment is also extremely depressed, and the market has little excitement. It is now learned that China Tea and Wu Chang Tea companies are repeatedly cabling overseas regarding last year's Pingshui Dabang, requesting a price increase, but it is difficult to predict whether this will proceed smoothly. As for other domestic sales varieties, supply and demand remain relatively balanced, and market prices are mostly similar to the previous day. However, the Wenzhou New Longjing market is relatively firm and strong due to the impact of limited production and inventory.</p>
<p>Cement Tends to Rise</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Cement prices are trending upward due to rumors that the exchange rate is about to be adjusted.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Inventory Insufficient, Price Increases Unlikely to Decline, Rayon and Silk Goods Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The rising trend of raw silk is in full swing, and sentiment is unanimously optimistic. According to industry insiders, it is unlikely that the rising trend of the silk market will decline in the short term. There are three reasons for this: (1) Credit for industry players has eased; (2) The expected cost of new silk will definitely be higher than current market prices; (3) Last year's inventory was insufficient, totaling less than 5,000 piculs, which is only enough for domestic silk factories for two to three months. Due to the above reasons, even if foreign sales do not improve, the market trend is that prices will still be difficult to return to normal.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market continued to rise sharply. 120-count Kōzan bright yarn traded at 8.005 million yuan, and then gradually rose again, reaching a maximum of 8.2 million yuan. By noon, because the stock market had rebounded slightly, there was no shortage of people selling at high prices, so sentiment gradually softened, and it finally closed at 7.6 million yuan. In the afternoon, the market rebounded again, rising from 8 million yuan to 8.2 million yuan, 900,000 yuan higher than the previous day. 75-count semi-bright yarn also followed suit, increasing by 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's factory silk market was slightly quieter than the previous day. Bids were uniformly increased by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Only C-grade was priced at 20 million yuan. Other high-grade lots were also bid at this price. Aged lots were bid at 19 million yuan, and dry reeling was ignored, and the bids did not advance.</p>
<p>Because the raw materials for silk goods have risen again, factory prices have all increased, and as credit is gradually easing, transactions are also gradually becoming more active. Yesterday, the price of Mayer bedspreads was 8.6 million yuan. Dachang plaid crepe rose sharply by 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. Rayon goods also rose by 4% to 5%. The prices of Shenghang and other goods all rose uniformly yesterday.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau Adjusts Cigarette Tax Again</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance partially adjusted the tax on various brands of cigarettes in the city on the 10th of this month, it plans to universally adjust all brands of cigarettes again, increasing them all by 30%. It also plans to implement this on the 20th of this month. The cigarette factory industry association of this city has requested a postponement of the implementation and suggested that the date be extended to June 1st of the second half of the year. It is now learned that the Goods Tax Bureau has agreed to start from the 26th of this month.</p>
<h3>Full-Weight Tung Oil Rises</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The price of full-weight tung oil in Hankou has reached 40 million yuan. Yesterday, there were many trades opening in the market, and the price has been bid up to 500,000 yuan per picul.</p>
<p>China Fir Gradually Rises</p>
<p>The market price of China fir has been rising recently. It is heard that rice prices in the production area of Fujian have soared, and sawmill workers are mostly calculated based on rice prices, resulting in an increase in costs, which has affected market prices in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shi Ma Longan Slightly Looser</h3>
<p>Some Shi Ma longan has arrived in recent days, but because sales are relatively sluggish, prices have weakened slightly. For example, Maqu opened at 1.156 million yuan yesterday, and Mahong at 990,000 yuan, both showing slight weakening compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Hardware Market Situation</p>
<p>The recent hardware market situation has been in a quiet process. A batch of foreign nails and sand cloth have arrived, so the selling price has gone from tight to soft, but actual sales are still smooth, and prices have not declined.</p>
<h3>Drought Forms in Hebei Province, Wheat Harvest to be Reduced</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 16th] Hebei Province has failed to receive timely rainfall this year, and a drought has formed. If it does not rain within the next few days, the wheat harvest will be reduced to below 50%. Some counties near Beiping have slightly better irrigation, and the drought situation in farmland is not as severe as in central and southern Hebei.</p>
<h3>"France's Tragedy" - An Old Tune Repeated? The Stage of the Fourth Republic</h3>
<p>— Airmail from Paris, May 2nd. Special Correspondent: Mao Shuqing</p>
<p>France, the first nation to ignite the torch of liberty. Without the bloodshed at the Bastille prison in 1789, the democratic revolutions of the world might have been delayed for decades. After the First World War, France was the strongest military power. At the Versailles Peace Conference, a mere snort from Clemenceau could alter the course of international diplomacy. But in the blink of an eye, the "Maginot Line" was lost in three weeks, and halfway through the Second World War, the name of France vanished from the international stage.</p>
<p>French-Style Democracy Greatly Differs from British and American</p>
<p>De Gaulle called this transformation over the past twenty-one years "the decline of France." The writer André Maurois wrote a book called "France's Tragedy." Whether decline or tragedy, both refer to the decline of France's "national fortune." They both shared a similar view on the cause of this decline: the disguised and incomplete so-called "democracy" was to blame. In those twenty-one years, France changed cabinets nearly a hundred times. The multitude of parties and conflicting opinions led to low administrative efficiency. Coupled with the innate "hedonism" of urban French people—seeking comfort and enjoyment—they forgot vigilance and the importance of national defense, which was even more important than comfort. When I was in Paris the year before last, I heard a French friend talking about the "Tianbao era," saying that when the Versailles Conference opened in 1919, the French General Staff sent army planes to patrol and guard the skies over Paris every day. At that time, the aircraft industry was still in its infancy, and France had the largest number of planes. But by 1939, when Hitler launched his large-scale invasion, French planes were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, the Axis powers were defeated, and France remained one of the victorious nations. During my year or so in the United States, I only saw France's position in the international arena gradually rising. The Four Powers became the Five Powers, with France squeezing in. The Five Powers then became the Four Powers again, pushing China out. A diplomacy professor at New York University, Hodges, once told me that France was able to replace China because of its internal unity. Professor Hodges' words clearly contained a well-intentioned warning for China. But he continued, saying that the Communist Party could use popular votes to become the majority party in parliament, without any external coercion. France would be the first. The question was whether the French Communist Party would be able to live in a democratic atmosphere forever. In other words, if the French Communist Party were to seize power, would it tolerate the existence of the Socialist Party, the Catholic Party, and so on? Professor Hodges still considered this a mystery. He asked me to pay attention to these behind-the-scenes issues after arriving in Paris and, if convenient, to write him a long letter.</p>
<p>During my three-week stay in Paris, thanks to introductions from the French intelligence service, I met many people and heard many different opinions. My overall impression of these visits was that, first, French democracy is vastly different from that of Britain and America. Britain and America emphasize "party politics." People from two different parties generally share similar views on domestic and foreign affairs. Britons and Americans are never willing to say which party they belong to, or even whether they will vote Republican or Democratic today. The French are not like that. The gulf between parties is deep, and attacks are fierce, sometimes even resorting to unscrupulous means to achieve their mutual attacks. In other words, Britons and Americans emphasize party politics, but party affiliation is weak. The French emphasize party politics, and party affiliation is strong. British and American party newspapers never admit that they are party newspapers. French party newspapers are forthright. To put it more bluntly, Britons and Americans believe that the nation is more important than the party. The French believe that the party is more important than the nation. I am not exaggerating when I say this. The Parisian newspaper "L'Humanité" has several columns of reasoned articles every day arguing for abandoning nationalism and that the French should discard "the concept of the nation inherited from the Middle Ages. Because...the so-called national concept, love of the motherland, and even the French Empire, are tools of the ruling class!"</p>
<p>New Wine in Old Bottles, Fresh Paint on the Door</p>
<p>The concept of the nation is reflected in the real problems facing France: the Vietnam War and the Madagascar affair. On March 11th of this year, when the National Assembly met to discuss the Vietnam issue, Communist Party deputy Garcia physically attacked right-wing deputy Pierre André, throwing the meeting into chaos. Before this adjournment, another major incident occurred in the National Assembly. The French Ministry of Defense discovered evidence that four deputies from Madagascar had colluded in an insurrection by workers on the island, and the police headquarters prepared to arrest them. The Communist Party has always opposed the use of force in Vietnam and Madagascar, defended the four deputies, and cited the Constitution: the personal freedom of members of parliament cannot be infringed upon. Without the consent of all members, security agencies cannot act illegally. When that Communist Party deputy spoke with impassioned eloquence, another deputy from the Catholic Party slapped him, throwing the entire chamber into chaos again. This was the second time.</p>
<p>Afterward, the National Assembly announced a one-month adjournment, reopening only recently. Parisian newspapers have headlined the re-discussed dispute. The French love to watch a spectacle. Most French people are passionate about politics but have no interest in making rational analyses. The traditional "representative politics" has accustomed them to entrusting political power to political parties, allowing political parties to adhere to "the separation of powers and checks and balances." During the sixty-five years of the Third Republic, France went from chaos to stability to prosperity, even leading the world for a period, before the "Tragedy of France" in 1940. When the Fourth Republic was first inaugurated, the national hero De Gaulle vowed to make France "undergo a complete transformation" and not repeat the old path of the Third Republic. However, last year, the people voted for a new constitution, which remained one of party politics and representative politics. The French people said: If not this, what else can we do? De Gaulle's desire for centralized power and military reorganization certainly made sense. But we endured hardship and defeated the fascists; we cannot allow ourselves to have a fascist regime!</p>
<p>Thus, the Fourth Republic remained indistinguishable from the Third Republic. New wine in old bottles. Although the names have changed, the reality remains that of the celebrities and politicians of over a decade ago. The Senate is now called the "French Parliament," and the lower house by the Seine River, freshly painted, is called the "National Assembly Hall." Of the 619 seats in the National Assembly, the Communist Party has the most, followed by the Socialist Party, and then the Popular Republican Movement. These are the "three pillars" that currently control the government. Next are Herriot's "Radical Socialist Party," the right-wing "Catholic Party," and even the far-right "Liberal Republican Party." De Gaulle's "Rally of the French People" was newly formed and could not participate in the elections at the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>Thorez's Secretary: Comrade Ducroux</p>
<p>I did not have the opportunity to meet the leader of the French Communist Party, Thorez. After De Gaulle's party-building plan was announced, Thorez gave a public speech, severely scolding De Gaulle. His speech was not particularly lively but was clear and well-organized. He had spent a long time in Moscow and most of the war years in Soviet Russia. Therefore, during De Gaulle's tenure, there were several attempts to punish him for the crime of "evading military service." At a press conference after Wallace arrived in Paris, I met Thorez's secretary, Comrade Ducroux, who had been dispatched by the French Communist Party to receive Wallace. He spoke excellent English. He said that Thorez had the support of five million industrial workers, and "only the Communist Party is truly working for the happiness of French workers." He also said that France is now poor, its economy exhausted, and its finances are unbalanced. Yet it still maintains a large army of 400,000 troops overseas, using force against the weak Vietnamese nation, using force against Madagascar, and maintaining vigilance in North Africa, stubbornly maintaining the interests of the "old empire." Every day, the supplies to overseas territories cost more than a million francs. The victims are the French working masses. Therefore, the Communist Party is firmly opposed in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Ducroux was unwilling to talk about the relationship between the French Communist Party and Moscow, but he admitted that the Communist Party has no national concept. Regarding the current situation in France, he believed that since all parties were uneasy about the Communist Party taking the position of "Prime Minister," they should allow the "Socialist Party" to transition. He said, "The Socialist Party claims to be Marxist, but they are not true believers!"</p>
<h3>"Father of the Popular Front": Léon Blum's Style</h3>
<p>The founding father of the Socialist Party is Léon Blum, the father of the "Popular Front" worldwide. This extraordinary old man recently celebrated his seventy-sixth birthday. All the celebrities and political figures in France attended the celebration, with only one exception: De Gaulle. It is said that Léon Blum personally instructed not to invite De Gaulle to participate. Whether this is true or false, we outsiders have no way of knowing. That was four or five days after the Strasbourg speech.</p>
<p>In an era where liberalism and totalitarianism, capitalism and communism, are irreconcilable and have not yet reached a breaking point, Léon Blum is an inevitable product. Although there is only one Léon Blum in the world, there are countless incarnations of him. The Third Republic of France has come to an end. If someone writes a history of the Fourth Republic of France in the future, Léon Blum should be the first person mentioned in the introduction. General De Gaulle founded the Fourth Republic, but when De Gaulle became weary of traditional democratic politics, Léon Blum, with his prestige, seniority, and political skill sufficient to rival De Gaulle, drove De Gaulle away. Although this case was not done by Léon himself, it arose from the Socialist Party's open opposition to De Gaulle. Léon Blum himself said: "The French Socialist Party has never had a strict organization, a core function, or a party discipline. The Socialist Party has become a party through spiritual infusion and shared political views." What views? In economics, they advocate reforming capitalism, singing the praises of the left, but "they are democratic and oppose the Communist Party's violent methods." Therefore, they are always "peacemakers," a bridge between two conflicting ideologies.</p>
<p>The reason why the Fourth Republic of France is able to become "one of the Four Powers" today is due to the use of a bridging model, both domestically and internationally. Foreign Minister Bidault, although not affiliated with the Socialist Party, Bidault's diplomacy is infused with the spirit of Léon Blum. Today, the President of France, Auriol, a veteran of the Socialist Party and former Speaker of the Senate, has recently gone on a tour of Africa. Prime Minister Ramadier, a major general promoted by Léon, is handsome with a flowing beard and is skilled in handling matters in multiple ways. Ramadier's cabinet is a mixed bag. There are many arguments at every cabinet meeting, but Ramadier's "bridge" can connect different views.</p>
<p>Wallace Arrives in France, Departs Hastily</p>
<p>When Wallace visited France, the Socialist Party government expressed a warm welcome. Wallace stayed at the Hotel George V near the Arc de Triomphe. He originally planned to give a series of public speeches, but later, for some unknown reason, he flew back to the United States in a hurry. Before Wallace left, Léon Blum invited him to dinner, and the celebrities of the Socialist Party were all in attendance. During the meal, Wallace spoke about his views on the current world situation and expressed his admiration for Léon's steadfast socialist position. It is said that Léon only smiled at Wallace. Finally, the seventy-six-year-old man advised Wallace to raise a thousand chickens after returning to the United States. Léon said that he had a chicken farm at home with a total of more than two thousand chickens. "Raising chickens is not only profitable but also good for the mind and body." Wallace saw which way the wind was blowing and followed the wise master, speaking about his knowledge of chicken farming from his agricultural science studies. The next day, Wallace left in a hurry.</p>
<p>At his first press conference after returning to New York, Wallace raised the issue of "the crisis of civil war in France." Parisian newspapers carried it with small headlines. The newspaper "Le Figaro," which supported De Gaulle, also made a sarcastic criticism of Wallace, calling him "naive and superficial." On that same day, Herriot's "Radical Socialist Party" telegraphed its support for De Gaulle.</p>
<p>Herriot Returns Home, Re-raises the Flag</p>
<p>In Chinese transliterations, Herriot and Auriol are truly a confusing mess. My French colleagues often laugh at my inability to distinguish them. I am reminded of what John Gunther said in "Inside Asia" about how difficult it was to distinguish "Chen Cheng and Zhang Qun." Auriol is the current President of France from the Socialist Party. Herriot is the former Prime Minister and leader of the Radical Socialist Party. After the First World War, he was a "red-hot" figure in the Third Republic for several years. After the Nazis attacked Paris, Herriot was arrested and imprisoned near Berlin. Herriot said in one of his "autobiographies" that he hoped every day that Allied planes would bomb Berlin. "I have only an old, useless body left. Even if I am bombed to death, I would be willing!" But he did not die. On the day Soviet troops entered Berlin, he was transported to Moscow by a Russian military plane.</p>
<p>After spending some time in Moscow, Herriot returned to France and re-raised the flag of his "Radical Socialist Party" and also attracted many small parties and factions. He formed an organization called the "Left Republican Union." The French say that Herriot's "left" wing is a sham, that he is neither "radical" nor "socialist." He is purely a capitalist traditional democratic party with few members. It occupies only sixty-six seats of the six hundred and nineteen seats in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The "Left Republican Union" also participated in the current cabinet. Initially, it had made vows and pledges to support Prime Minister Ramadier's rise to power. However, because its position in the cabinet was not important enough, it was more accurate to call it "in the opposition" than "in power." Those in the opposition are more likely to be dissatisfied with the status quo, while De Gaulle, with his lofty prestige, is raising the banner of overturning the status quo.</p>
<p>The Communist Party Uses its Skills to Strike at De Gaulle</p>
<p>The most vehement opposition to De Gaulle naturally comes from the Communist Party and the "General Confederation of Labour" controlled by the Communist Party. The Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité" uses all means to attack De Gaulle's resurgence. It says that he is "colluding" with the big arms dealer Schneider, that he is inciting military rebellion, and that he is creating a repeat of the "February 6th" riot of 1935. (Note: On February 6th, 1935, French fascist elements staged a major riot. It is said that the riot was presided over by Marshal Pétain. The rioters wanted to set fire to the National Assembly, and order was disrupted from the National Opera House to the Place de la Concorde. Later, the police opened fire to disperse the crowd.) It even says that he was bribed to pardon Marshal Pétain's death sentence that year.</p>
<p>In the past week, the Socialist Party's attitude has been more cunning and more mature. As I said before, the Socialist Party does not have a strong party organization, a core cadre, or a party disciplinary organization. Its opposition to De Gaulle is an opposition to his denial of the current constitution and his attacks on democratic party politics, not an opposition to De Gaulle himself and his supporters. In other words, if De Gaulle's new organization is able to follow the "constitutional norms" of the French Third Republic for sixty-five years to run for election, the Socialist Party can still recognize him as a friend.</p>
<p>Only with such an "all things to all people" approach can the Socialist Party always be a "peacemaker" or a "third party" in the national government, that is, always occupying a position in the French government. As for what major achievements the Socialist Party has made, the French find it difficult to say. The first Socialist Party Prime Minister after De Gaulle's resignation, Gouin, is now facing a "corruption" lawsuit, accused of colluding with French wine merchants to evade national taxes. Wine is a major business in France. Before the war, France's annual wine exports could bring in a large amount of foreign exchange. Since the liberation of Paris, it is said that most of the French wine has been "sold domestically." The current Prime Minister, Ramadier, is planning to levy heavy taxes on domestic sales of wine and perfume to increase the quantity of exports.</p>
<p>The Popular Republican Movement Takes New Measures</p>
<p>The party that has made a 180-degree turn this time is the Popular Republican Movement, the third largest party in France. In the past, it not only supported De Gaulle but also directly accepted De Gaulle's leadership. In the left-right division of French party politics, the Popular Republican Movement belongs to the right wing because the party itself has a strong Catholic religious flavor, so its "anti-communist" color is also more distinct. After De Gaulle withdrew from the political stage, the representative of the Popular Republican Movement was Bidault. Bidault has always supported the "constitutional norms," so there have been differences of opinion between De Gaulle and Bidault. After De Gaulle's new party was formed, many people in the "Popular Republican Movement" defected to De Gaulle's "Grand Rally." The former Minister of Armaments of the French cabinet (or Minister of Munitions), Michelet, and the younger brother of the current French Minister of the Army, Florelle, a key member of the Popular Republican Movement, formally announced their participation in De Gaulle's new organization.</p>
<p>Reality prompted the Popular Republican Movement to take new measures. Its central party headquarters announced that anyone who participates in De Gaulle's organization will be expelled from the party. Thus, some left, and some stayed. French political commentators observe that the MRP (Popular Republican Movement) will no longer have a future because it has lost its "right-wing" importance, although it is now one of the "three pillars" of the cabinet.</p>
<p>In any case, General De Gaulle himself is admirable. A typical French soldier, an absolute patriot. We outsiders find it difficult to criticize who is right and who is wrong in French political views, but De Gaulle's motives, his vigilance against the tragedy of the late Third Republic, seem to us observers to be necessary in fact.</p>
<p>British Reporter Comments: French Politics are Chaotic</p>
<p>In Paris, I met the diplomatic correspondent for the London Times, Maxey Morrow. We talked about the chaotic situation on the French political stage. Morrow has never had much hope for the French coalition government. He could not understand why Britain, the United States, and France, all democracies with party politics, are so different from each other. He also believes that France's current chaotic party politics will increase the "centrifugal force" of the people and make it impossible to control the "French Empire" overseas! Later, I saw in the London Times that his telegrams also said this!</p>
<h3>Henry Moore, Retiring, and Hong Kong's Deformed Prosperity</h3>
<p>— Hong Kong Airmail News on the 10th, by Our Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>Post-victory Hong Kong has not only restored its pre-war prosperity, but has become even more prosperous than before the war. Because the domestic political situation cannot be stabilized and the economic crisis is deepening day by day, the bourgeoisie continue to come to Hong Kong. Along with these people comes fleeing capital. According to reliable estimates, the capital fleeing from the mainland to Hong Kong recently amounts to more than one hundred billion per month. This enormous sum directly causes economic chaos in the mainland and indirectly fuels Hong Kong's deformed prosperity.</p>
<p>Although legitimate businesses are suffering a recession, banks in Hong Kong are springing up like mushrooms after a rain. There are now thirty Chinese-owned banks, and one hundred and seventy-one similar financial firms. The number of banks and financial firms in preparation is even more difficult to estimate. Their main business is buying and selling telegraphic transfers, in other words, acting as intermediaries for capital flight. Bank deposits are also increasing rapidly. With so much mobile capital and no proper outlet, the only result is to go down the path of "speculation". In Hong Kong's financial market, following the trends of "speculators," great disturbances are caused from time to time. The price of gold has been hovering around $265 for a long time, with little movement. Currently, the target of "speculators" has shifted to Saigon paper and stocks.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's population has already reached a record high of 1.7 million and is still increasing. The housing shortage is also becoming increasingly serious. Although the government has explicitly banned the collection of "key money" (premium for renting), the "key money" for an ordinary house is still about HK$3,000 to 4,000, and for a more luxurious one, it is HK$30,000 to 50,000. No matter how high the "key money" is, there are still people rushing to pay it!</p>
<p>Office space in Central is even more in short supply. The "key money" for a room is usually HK$15,000, and a telephone line costs an additional HK$3,000 to 4,000. Wealthy merchants and tycoons from Shanghai all want a spacious and luxurious office. Everyone is bidding high prices, and the "key money" is naturally soaring day by day. In order to meet the urgent need for office space, some real estate companies have come up with the innovative idea of developing upwards. The Princess Building, originally seven stories, is now being expanded by three stories. The Shell Building is quickly catching up and is also undergoing major construction. The most ridiculous thing is that the rooftop structures are not even concrete yet, but the office space has already been fully booked.</p>
<p>Recently, a piece of Chinese government-owned land, located at the intersection of Queen's Road Central and D'Aguilar Street, next to HSBC Bank, is the most ideal location in the Central business district. On the day of the auction, the Bank of China and Sir Robert Ho Tung competed to buy it. As a result, the Bank of China defeated Robert Ho Tung with a high price of $3,745,000, becoming the owner of this triangular plot of land. The average price per square inch of land was $250, almost equivalent to one tael of gold, which has to be considered an astonishing feat. They are now planning to build a Bank of China Building even grander than the HSBC Bank building, with a construction cost estimated at over $3 million and a completion time of thirty months. The Bank of China will use the lower two floors for its own purposes. The Hong Kong government has already booked half of all the office space for a term of five years, and the rest has also been eagerly booked by various government agencies stationed in Hong Kong. Needless to say, it was fully booked long ago. In order to balance revenue and expenditure, the Hong Kong government has decided to levy income tax. Various sectors of Hong Kong and Kowloon, due to the cumbersome procedures and incompatibility with business practices, have specially organized a Committee Against Direct Taxation, resolutely opposing it. They submitted three petitions to the Hong Kong government, sent two urgent telegrams to the British government to appeal, and also met with Governor Henry Moore to make a direct appeal. They also launched a campaign to have all the stores in Hong Kong affix their seals in protest. As a result, the Legislative Council still passed the bill by a vote of thirteen to three. Although the anti-tax committee represented the vast majority of taxpayers, their "public opinion" failed to achieve victory. The anti-tax committee also disbanded to adapt to the situation. It is said that interest, profits, and salaries taxes will be levied in September of this year, and property tax may be implemented earlier. According to the new tax regulations, single people with an annual income of less than $7,000 do not need to pay tax, and married people without children with an annual income of less than $12,000 do not need to pay tax. According to the general salary level, it is estimated that very few Chinese will have to pay income tax.</p>
<p>Governor Moore's retirement is scheduled for the 16th of this month, when he will return to England by ship. These days, the whole of Hong Kong is in a mood of reluctant farewell. Of all the past governors of Hong Kong, Governor Moore was very unfortunate. He had not been in office long before the Pacific War broke out. The enemy attacked Hong Kong like madmen, and Governor Moore's hardship and suffering can be imagined. Later, Hong Kong fell, and Governor Moore was also detained in a concentration camp in Taiwan, where he endured many more hardships. After the victory, Governor Moore returned to his post and personally rebuilt Hong Kong from the ruins. He shared the joys and sorrows of the people of Hong Kong, and therefore the people have a special affection for him. The new Governor, Grantham, will not be able to take office until July. During the two-month transition period, the Colonial Secretary, McDougall, will act as governor.</p>
<p>As the domestic turmoil continues, Hong Kong's prosperity continues to grow.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Steinbeck's New Work</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The famous American novelist John Steinbeck gave a humorous answer to a newspaper reporter's interview: "You are welcome to write about how I write however you like. I can't remember what I've done myself, or how many works I've written. Originally, biography itself is half fiction." But we should still first introduce his brief biography.</p>
<p>He was born on February 27, 1902, in Salinas, Monterey County, California. His mother was a teacher, and his father was a local civil servant. His earliest memories were of words and people. As a young man, he wanted to use the former to serve the latter. In 1919, he wrote for the school magazine and was also a class leader and played basketball well. From 1919 to 1925, he studied at Stanford University, choosing the books he liked to read, so he did not get a degree after leaving school. He took a cargo ship to New York and worked as a reporter and mason in Manhattan. After returning to California, he devoted himself to writing. He lived in the Sierras for a period of time. He was once so poor that he couldn't even afford a dog. His first three books were "Cup of Gold," "The Pastures of Heaven," and "To a God Unknown." The total sales of these three books were less than three thousand copies. In 1935, "Tortilla Flat" brought him success. In 1937, "Of Mice and Men" further increased his reputation. After that, he published "The Red Pony" (1937), "The Long Valley" (1937), "The Grapes of Wrath" (1939), "The Forgotten Village" (1941), "The Moon Is Down" (1942), "Bombs Away" (1942), and "Cannery Row" (1945). In 1943, he went to Europe as a correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune. He is a pure writer. He criticizes himself very strictly and never hoped for great success. He was afraid that after becoming famous, he would not be willing to work hard to improve his skills. He was quite surprised that critics could not see the meaning of his novels. He has more unpublished works than published works; he continues to seek new projects. His latest book, "The Wayward Bus" (1947), is his longest novel in eight years.</p>
<p>This new book cannot be compared with any of his previous novels. It does not have the gentleness of "The Pastures of Heaven" and "Tortilla Flat," nor the fierce taciturnity of "Of Mice and Men," nor is it a tragic story of social struggle like "The Grapes of Wrath." You cannot say that this book is better or worse than his previous books. Every page shows Steinbeck's unique style. It stands on its own. His work, like Mark Twain's, has been developing his talent for twenty years.</p>
<p>In the past, Steinbeck wrote mostly about the cannery, doctors, dockworkers, and prostitutes on the riverbank in Monterey County. But now his background is restaurants and car dealerships, among tall forests. The car dealership owner's name is Juan Chicoy, and he lives with his wife. Steinbeck had wanted to publish this book for a long time, and he had been nurturing the nine characters he created in his mind for a long time.</p>
<p>What he wants to write is about people who are natural and simple. This theme has fascinated many writers. Since Rousseau, he has wanted to explain: when a person or family is thrown onto a deserted island, the noble and animalistic man becomes the emperor, and there are also love disputes, like Barrie's "The Admirable Crichton." Or like the adventurous Tarzan. Juan is a mixed-race of Irish and Mexican descent. He is also animalistic, but his taciturnity is restrained when he sees the woman he likes. He is a free man who is not bound by any kind of restraint. He can leave the person who loves him to the point of jealousy, or leave the business he has painstakingly managed at any time, wearing only a shirt, and start his wandering life again. Natural and free people are often found in Steinbeck's works, from the animalism in "Of Mice and Men" to the gentle and simple farmers in "Tortilla Flat." Juan is a strong, passionate man, knowledgeable about mechanics, and loves and understands humanity, especially when he meets women, like a bee meeting nectar. His wife knows his character, and she lives anxiously, afraid of losing him; if it really happens, then she will have to drink to relieve her sorrows.</p>
<p>Two people live with them: a girl who is madly in love with Clark Gable's movies, and she serves customers in the restaurant; and a young mechanic named Pippin. Four guests arrive and wait for Juan to take them to the western plateau in an old car during a storm. One of them is an honest woman, full of temptation, whose days have been spent being cursed, so she cannot find a job. People only want to rape her, not marry her. She has to use her naked body to show to honorable merchants to earn some money. After the performance, she drinks a large glass of red wine. There is also an honest woman who is healthy and greedy. She sometimes hopes that her parents will suddenly die. The wealthy Pritchard couple are going to Mexico with their daughter, so that when they return home, they can boast about their experiences. Journalists will ask them for photos, and women's associations will call his wife the light of women. This humble couple is written very successfully in the novel. Pritchard is a filthy, loud, and hypocritical man. There is also a customer who tells jokes.</p>
<p>They are all waiting for the car to depart. Juan knows that his wife has mental problems because he glanced at Pritchard's daughter. He knows that when he gets home, his wife will be drunk again. As they are about to arrive, the bridge is broken, and Juan risks driving the car on a dangerous mountain road that has never been traveled before. As expected, Pritchard's daughter falls in love with this primitive man, and Pritchard falls in love with the woman he once saw naked, the wine flowing down her thighs like purple blood.</p>

<p>Spring</p>
<p>Spring, she came herself.</p>
<p>She stepped across this land, and the land awakened; she kissed the lips of the flowers, and azaleas bloomed all over the mountains; she stroked the feathers of the lark, attracting swallows; she whistled by the stream, and the orchestra of water waves began to play; she, the gauze touching the trees and fields... all came to life.</p>
<p>She was also half-pushed and half-pulled into the city.</p>
<p>Women who are sensitive to spring, all bloom in the streets in a riot of color, and the swaying flower hair attracts swarms of bees.</p>
<p>And, look, jeeps bring peach blossoms from outside the city, and clouds of dust rise in the streets.</p>
<p>Is that how spring is? Is that spring?</p>
<p>I doubt, how can the footsteps of spring not step into that region of deep water and scorching fire? Why doesn't she kiss those weeping, tearful faces? Why doesn't her kind hand stroke the women who commit suicide by jumping into the river? She is even stingy with a smile for the suffering masses!</p>
<p>Is that how spring is? Is that spring?</p>
<p>I think, spring, the true spring of mankind, is still very far away, because ice and snow are still heavily pressing on our bodies!</p>
<p>Autumn</p>
<p>A red leaf, gently slid from the wings of the autumn wind, some sentimental people, their hearts fluttered, and sadness rose like evening haze.</p>
<p>Such a life is classical, like a beautiful dream, giving us too much imagination.</p>
<p>But, today autumn is still so rich and strong, not changed in the slightest.</p>
<p>This is a season we thirst for, we must greet her with the most excited heart and the most excited hands, our laughter, overflows in the endless fields.</p>
<p>Autumn, the crops are ripe. The ears of grain, like pregnant young women, shyly lower their heads. When the wind gently passes by, golden waves roll in the fields!</p>
<p>On the farm, the sound of threshing rises crisply, mixed with the giggling laughter of women.</p>
<p>When running past the door of a farmer's house, the fragrance of new rice rushes into your nostrils from afar.</p>
<p>The land is the most faithful, and the labor paid out receives the interest it deserves, isn't this the most ideal and happiest life?</p>
<p>But the landlord is already holding a scale, waiting at the door!</p>
<p>Just when the dreams of the farmers are just made round, they are lightly broken again...</p>
<p>Will there be such a day? Their dreams will never be broken!</p>
<h3>Wang Yachen's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Hua Lin</p>
<p>Qi Baishi has a poem "Xijiangyue" to the famous painter Wang Yachen: "The lofty scholar in the clouds, his body away from the tiger's tail on thin ice." Yunyin is Wang Yachen's alias. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Wang shut his doors to paint, lived in seclusion, like Bodhidharma facing the wall, so his art greatly improved. For flowers, birds, insects, and fish, he is unwilling to put pen to paper unless he has observed them and experienced them. Although imitation has fine works, it is ultimately not the highest level of art. Wang's creation has become its own style.</p>
<p>Recalling 1920, when Wang returned to China after studying in Japan, he was already admired by the art world and enjoyed a high reputation. For thirty years, he devoted himself to research without interruption. In 1930, he returned to China from France and presided over Xinhua Art College. He applied the trends of modern art in European countries to Chinese painting. He worked hard day by day and progressed year by year. His art progressed with the times, and his reputation also grew higher.</p>
<p>Wang's technique is pure and skillful, and his brushstrokes are natural, without artificial facilities, which shows his lasting training and is by no means accidental. Genius must have long-term efforts, a peaceful mind, no desire for fame and fortune, no career without work, and no world without painting! For artists, the so-called microcosm is a world, and the world is a microcosm. These are the three tastes, not enough to tell outsiders.</p>
<h3>Tastes of a Mountain City</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhewu</p>
<p>Dragon Entertainment</p>
<p>Having lived in a mountain city for many years, I love the dragon boat races by the Jialing River every Dragon Boat Festival; those energetic "Yong ghosts," wearing red, yellow, green, white, and black colorful clothes, sit on narrow dragon boats and row vigorously and uniformly. The dragon head dances, commanding the flags in accordance with the singular drum rhythm, and floats rapidly on the rolling river. The occasional ups and downs of the tail man, nakedly exercising, appear brave and adventurous. The people standing on both sides of the mountain city set off firecrackers to cheer, and the award ceremony in front of the water command platform, that kind of activity and fun is worth cherishing.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is also the "dragon" that is held during the New Year Lantern Festival, which is called "Yaolong Deng" (begging for dragon lights). Those who beg for the dragon, each with a piece of red cloth tied on their heads, and bare-chested, dance with the dragon lantern in the cold winter. The dance itself is not much different from that in Jiangshi, but there is a more stimulating custom called "burning the dragon," which is rare elsewhere.</p>
<p>What is "burning the dragon"? It is to use a special firecracker to release sparks, shooting directly at the body of the dragon dancers. People who are burned by the sparks are not allowed to escape, but only to jump and move in place, resisting the sparks; although the skin and flesh are painful, they must grit their teeth and endure until the sparks are finished. It is said that there is a superstition that this can burn away bad luck. In fact, this is really a relic of a primitive and barbaric custom.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of "splashing water dragon" which is also quite fierce. That is, when it is drought and praying for rain, willows and the like are tied into a dragon, and the "dragon begging" method is used to parade through the streets; the shops store water to wait. When the dragon comes, they scoop water with washbasins and splash it on the dragon beggars, basin after basin. The dragon beggars are not allowed to escape, but stand up and suffer; sometimes their chests and faces are splashed red. This probably expresses sincerity, so they can move the heavens and the earth. In addition, there is also a kind of "filial dragon," which is used as a funeral rite when a funeral is held. It is made entirely of white paper, and the "loops" are no different from playing with a dragon, but it is not played.</p>
<p>Mouse World</p>
<p>There are mice everywhere, but there are especially many in Sichuan. Mice are good at digging holes, and Sichuan mice can also plow soil, swim, and cross gutters.</p>
<p>In the mountain city, late at night, when people are quiet, mice come out to forage for food, and can "cross the street" in droves; there are also unfortunate ones who are crushed to death in the center of the street by car wheels. Dead mice with ruptured intestines can be seen everywhere. But the mice's ability to "steal" is also particularly great. Except for new houses, no house is not visited by them. His breeding rate is very large. Some people say that if no one puts them out, Chongqing can quickly become a world of mice.</p>
<p>The mice in the mountain city are large and fat, and their guts are also big. They can lick children's faces and feet, and they can also bite things hanging in the house, diving down from a rope; but sometimes they also fall to the ground with the food and flee in panic. Ordinary paper, wood, they gnaw everything! They also eat leather shoes; if there are peanuts or the like hidden in the pockets of clothes, they can bite through the pockets and steal them; things pasted with paste, they can also eat only the place with paste.</p>
<p>However, mice are cunning after all. The medicine for catching mice mixed in rice, sometimes he can smell it, and he doesn't eat it, but from then on he may never come again.</p>
<p>Because there are many mice, there are few cats. In the mountain city, cats are sold in cages; and people who keep cats often tie them with ropes and only release them at night. However, it is really good to have a cat in the house. He is not bribed, does not show favoritism, and if he encounters a mouse, he will definitely catch it and "play" with it until it dies. Many people regard cats as docile, ruthless, and fickle playthings. I think that in the years when mouse theft is rampant, cats still have their uses, otherwise a mountain city would have become a world of mice long ago!</p>
<p>Gong Announcements</p>
<p>When I first arrived in the mountain city, I was confused. I often saw people beating gongs in the street, and then a circle of people would surround them, listening to him chanting words, scholarly. At first, I thought it was a monkey show, or a storyteller on the street; later I learned that this is called "gong announcement," which is a kind of "living announcement." It is a way of promoting government orders left over from the peasant society where many people are illiterate.</p>
<p>"Gong announcement" is probably the duty of people like "local police." Nowadays, it is handled by the subordinate figures of the township office and baojia (system of neighborhood control), but some are also concurrently employed as watchmen of the county government.</p>
<p>The gong announcer first obtains the announcement, and the主管 personnel tell him the content of the announcement. Sometimes he also needs to be familiar with the content and teach it well. He sets off to the streets and alleys, knocking the gong to gather the people. The common people have also gotten used to it. Once the gong is knocked, the crowd gathers to listen to him recite the content. If there is anything they don't understand, they can also ask carefully. After the announcement is over, three more gongs are knocked to indicate "completion".</p>
<p>This kind of announcement method is very primitive, simple, and interesting, and it is a small skill of governance that is worth promoting and preserving. It is a pity that it is rarely seen in other provinces.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 510</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Understood, Miss!" Perhaps Tsurumi's overbearing manner was stirred by the challenging words "handgun" and "test," and his nature, suppressed by false politeness, became lively. As he answered, he turned his hand and abruptly pulled out the German-made twenty-shot Mauser pistol from his waist. He stood in the center of the room, on a carpet in a space more than ten feet square, as if about to perform some skill:</p>
<p>"Inside...the bullets are already loaded, but the safety is still on, please take a look!" Tsurumi waited for the woman to indicate her wishes before deciding what to do.</p>
<p>"Excellent!" The woman shook her head, feigning a gesture, and extended a plump little hand, pushing it forward in the air. "Keep the gun in your hand, no need to give it to me... Just raise the gun, whether you shoot for real or just pretend, it's up to you! I'll try to disarm you!..." As she spoke, she glanced at the four people present.</p>
<p>"!" Tsurumi seemed to understand a little: He suddenly recalled that the day before yesterday, he and Bei, the small (unclear) acted in a (unclear) performance. (Unclear) very much (unclear), for a while, as if (unclear), then laughed heartily! What kind of (unclear) is this?</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if it's not turned off!" The (unclear) (unclear) said.</p>
<p>"Very good, very good!" Tsurumi also used his usual meaningless tone. He hadn't inquired whether Shouyi had such a younger sister. However, he remembered repeatedly mentioning the skills and achievements of Little Tiger and Yaoqun in front of Shouyi. Little Tiger's unarmed disarming was also one of the proud reports. This report was probably widely spread throughout the Hundredfold Endurance Manor by Shouyi, so it excited this young lady, who also came to test her skills and show off.</p>
<p>"Come on!...Just raise the gun, and I'll make my move!" She gave the order.</p>
<p>"I'll unload the bullets." Tsurumi became a little "effeminate" again; perhaps it was a final test for the other party.</p>
<p>"No need...you can even take off the safety!" She expressed her indifference.</p>
<p>With a "click," Tsurumi indeed turned off the safety. At the same time, he adopted a stance, raised his hand very quickly, hoping (unclear) a sound (unclear), the bullet was about to fly out... At that moment, the young lady seemed to leap out of the sofa: (Unclear), first moved twice to the left and right, still (unclear) toward the target, and then in (unclear) moment, the person had disappeared. As Tsurumi turned around abruptly, trying to find the target, he felt a sudden numbness in his forearm holding the gun. The hand holding the gun was empty, and the gun had disappeared.</p>
<p>"Here!" The voice was still crisp and sweet, with a hint of giggling.</p>
<p>Tsurumi used his skills, turning around twice in a row, which was agile enough, but he only heard the voice and couldn't see the person.</p>
<p>Tsurumi had also practiced jujutsu and kendo, and his skills were very flexible, above the average level of a samurai. At this time, he indeed showed his true abilities. He was seen leaping left and right, forward and backward, in this ten-foot square space, but he couldn't find the other person.</p>
<p>"Here!" She teased repeatedly.</p>
<p>After turning around like this several times in a row and still not seeing the other person, Tsurumi became stubborn and somewhat anxious. Knowing that turning around like this all day would be useless, he gathered his strength, built up momentum, and suddenly leaped forward, about five or six feet away. Just as his toes touched the ground, he suddenly jumped up again into a headstand, doing a somersault in mid-air. His body drew an arc-like line in the air, returning to the spot where he had just jumped off and landing steadily. This technique is rarely used in judo matches. However, it is necessary to learn this move when practicing to the fifth dan. Because when encountering a strong opponent, one might be thrown out, sometimes more than ten feet away. The mark of a good player is landing on both feet, standing firmly, without even a ripple.</p>
<h3>Hiring Prostitutes for Pleasure is a Great Theft</h3>
<p>— Qilou</p>
<p>Four guests with badges on their chests and the manners of gentlemen hired prostitutes for pleasure in a hotel room, but unfortunately, joy turned to sorrow when the police station sent officers to arrest them. It turned out that these four guests were major thieves from Nanjing. Due to the strict wanted notices issued by the military and police, they had fled to Shanghai. They worked in Shanghai and continued to engage in theft, unaware that the police station had already discovered their whereabouts and arrested them without lifting a finger.</p>
<p>Such news is commonplace in Shanghai. It is no longer a case of "a man bites a dog" but should be classified as "a dog bites a man." However, news is always news, and it has its own newsworthy value.</p>
<p>Major thieves hiring prostitutes for pleasure can be rephrased as using improper means to obtain money and then seeking pleasure. Sometimes, these people even target the women in the pleasure venues as objects of theft after enjoying themselves. Not long ago, there was a case of wealthy dancers robbing dance girls of their jewelry. They steal to indulge in extravagance and, at the same time, because they have come by their wealth easily, they are even more willing to spend money like dirt and enjoy themselves desperately. After enjoying themselves, they have no choice but to steal again. This leads to a vicious cycle. The ancients said, "Abruptly in, abruptly out." In fact, those who "abruptly out" often do so because they have "abruptly in," and after "abruptly out," they are even more compelled to seek "abruptly in."</p>
<p>At a time when the whole country is mired in poverty, some people appear with extremely extravagant demeanors. If someone were to uncover the source of this extravagance, it would probably make those wealthy guests blush, just like those travelers who hired prostitutes for pleasure. Of course, not all wealthy guests in these pleasure venues are major thieves or notorious bandits. However, they may be petty thieves. They may not be (unclear) insignificant things from the past. However, they use the same invisible means to steal money from other people's pockets. They may not directly rob the gold and silver jewelry of the girls in the pleasure venues, but by invisible means, they steal from them and rob them. They even rob them to the point where they have no choice but to enter the pleasure venues. They are these extremely extravagant wealthy guests. When a dance girl is grateful to a guest for spending money like dirt on her and recognizing her worth, how often does she think that the other person is a petty thief and that she herself is the one being stolen from?</p>
<p>If she thought this way, she would definitely (unclear) that there are too few cases of people being caught like the four major thieves mentioned above.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Lincoln's Marriage</h3>
<p>— Peeking Through a Tube</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln, the savior who emancipated black slaves, had a compassionate heart and great benevolence. However, his marriage to Mary Todd was a constant source of pain and torment.</p>
<p>He and his wife were diametrically opposed in terms of personality, aspirations, and education. From his letter to Samuel Marshall, it can be seen that he was internally conflicted: "There is no news here. The most noteworthy thing is my marriage, which, from my perspective, feels extraordinarily astonishing and shocking."</p>
<p>Shortly after their engagement, he wrote a letter explaining that his love for Mary Todd had not reached the point of (unclear), entrusting his old friend Judge Lidder to deliver it to her. However, Mr. Lidder threw the letter into the ashes and asked him why he didn't say it himself. Lincoln finally mustered the courage to go and tell her the news, which caused her to burst into tears. Soft-hearted Mr. Lincoln couldn't bear to see a woman crying in front of him, so he embraced her, kissed her, and apologized to her. That's how they got together.</p>
<p>Her married life was not very sweet. One morning, he and his wife were having breakfast together. He didn't know what he said that made her furious. She picked up a cup of hot coffee and threw it at Mr. Lincoln's face. Under the bewildered gazes of many fellow lodgers, he didn't answer or scold her. Until the landlady used a towel to wipe him, he remained silent. This unpleasant life lasted for twenty-three years. He always endured it with patience, never harboring resentment, and never mentioning her bad temper to others. He truly had the forgiving heart of Jesus.</p>
<h3>The Comprehensive Examination and the Final Examination</h3>
<p>— Shen Kan</p>
<p>"Ten years of hard study under the window, learning has been completed, and the temples are already frosted." These are the sacrifices under the ancient imperial examination system. The Ming Dynasty selected scholars based on eight-legged essays because the emperor at the time was deeply afraid of the people rebelling against him. Therefore, he used this stereotyped writing to wear down the ambitions of heroes and talented people. The Qing Dynasty followed suit, and our country thus gained the title of "Sick Man of East Asia." Today, the comprehensive examination and the final examination in our country's education system, although different from the old imperial examinations, are worthy of study. The author graduated from Fudan University in 1943 and went through the comprehensive examination and the final examination. Today, observing the results, I have not actually discovered any benefits. Generally, those who rank high in exams find it difficult to be optimistic about their future. This is because they over-prepare for the exam, exert excessive mental effort, and after their studies, their thinking becomes dull, and they cannot flexibly apply what they have learned. Moreover, their bodies are injured, forming a premature (unclear) state. It is better to list the consequences of these two types of exams and then summarize them based on the facts.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about it theoretically. The comprehensive examination is implemented when high school students are (unclear). Its purpose is to improve education (unclear), taking China as one. However, each school has its own (unclear), and each has its own expertise, which should not be (unclear). (Unclear) to be squared and circled seems to have a reasonable (unclear).</p>
<p>As for the final examination, it is an examination held upon graduation from university. Examining various countries around the world, there is actually no such or similar education system. Generally, universities are specialized, and students also choose what they like and develop their own strengths. The four years of learning, until the senior fourth year, should include writing a graduation thesis. This thesis is the condensation of the essence of the four years of learning and can also be regarded as the crystallization of past learning. At this time, learning has been integrated into thought. Now, the final graduation examination examines the four years of learning, classifying and testing them, which is tantamount to disassembling the finished product again. There is nothing more unreasonable than this. The author's learning is unskilled, I only offer a personal view, hoping that the advanced scholars in the academic world will give guidance.</p>
<h3>The Usefulness of Friends</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>So-and-so went out and didn't return all night. His wife sent five telegrams to five of her husband's friends, asking if he was staying at their house.</p>
<p>Before long, the husband returned. Following him came five telegrams from the telegram office. They all said: "That's right, he's staying at my place tonight."</p>
<h3>The Joyful Buddha</h3>
<p>— Li Puyuan</p>
<p>Among the statues of esoteric Buddhism, the most eye-catching and controversial are probably the Joyful Buddhas.</p>
<p>The author has seen these statues in the Yonghe Temple in Beijing before, and this time, I had the opportunity to examine them in detail at the Ta'er Monastery. Indeed, all of these statues are incredibly strange. Some are still okay, but some, not only does the main deity have several heads, several faces, and dozens of pairs of hands, holding in their arms, or ankle-grabbing figures "similar to women;" moreover, they simply expose their reproductive organs. This might not be anything to the grassland people, whose views on sexual morality are not very different, but to us, who see sexual intercourse as very mysterious, and even the scholars who teach Neo-Confucianism are "too embarrassed" to bring out reproductive organs, how could it not be outrageous to the people of the Central Plains? No wonder some people speculate: The Yonghe Temple in Beijing was afraid that the emperor, who ascended the throne at a young age, would not understand sexual intercourse. The old princes were afraid that he would have no descendants and were too embarrassed to "teach" him, so they created these statues that demonstrated sexual intercourse, ostensibly as gods and Buddhas, but hinting at sexual intercourse. This is because the people on the grasslands do not know how humans survive, so they have to use these Buddha statues to show the reason for life and the seriousness of this matter…etc.</p>
<p>To the left of the Great Golden Tile Temple in Ta'er Monastery, right in the middle of the alley between the Great Sutra Hall and the Great Golden Tile Temple, facing west, there is a "Guardian Hall." The entrance is blocked by a fence door, as if it is unwilling to let ordinary people enter, but the incense burns continuously all day long. This is a large hall dedicated to enshrining all the Joyful Buddhas. The author, firstly because he was a guest invited by the chairman, and secondly because he got along well with the lamas, so he went in to observe again and again. Each time, it made me understand the absurdity of the previous legends about the Joyful Buddhas even more.</p>
<p>This hall is very similar in form to the Arhat Hall of inland Buddhist temples. All the groups of Joyful Buddhas are arranged densely. Generally speaking, it is already crowded enough, and each group, the main deity already has several heads and faces, and dozens of arms. In addition, most of them are holding one in their arms, and most of them are ankle-grabbing more than one, so it feels even more crowded. This is not counting the fact that each group occupies a (unclear). There are also (unclear) on the niches and (unclear) on the lintels—so people who come to visit the gods and Buddhas often have a feeling of fear that they will accidentally touch those heads, faces, hands, feet, reproductive organs…above and below, front and back!</p>
<p>The first time, I was also a little afraid. After a long time, I got used to it and gradually understood that these "guardians" had no intention of playing tricks on me. Moreover, referring to the "Shaman Dance" that I saw later, I know that they were originally spirits and monsters from the highlands. Or, when my Buddha was studying Buddhism on the grasslands, the spirits and monsters that arose from his psychology. They wanted to oppose my Buddha, and they also used their magic power to fight my Buddha. However, evil cannot defeat righteousness. Gradually, their magic power could not overcome my Buddha's power. Finally, they were conquered one by one by my Buddha's various incarnations. Therefore, they use embraces and sexual intercourse to express their flattery. In each group of Joyful Buddhas, the person being held up uses one hand to lift the skull full of fresh blood and offer it to my Buddha's incarnation (the main deity), indicating the joy they are contributing. Those who are being held, although "similar to women," are not necessarily women. Their original form may be the beasts trampled underfoot, and their transformation is probably the body of the person being held! As for the head of the main deity, it is a symbol of thought; the face is a symbol of emotion; the arms are a symbol of power; and the objects in the hands are symbols of magical treasures!</p>
<p>Each group is a dramatic story of my Buddha conquering evil thoughts. The overall meaning is "guarding the Dharma."</p>
<p>But, what a subtle and special kind of sculpture art they are!</p>
<h3>The Burden of Children</h3>
<p>— Ding Xiao</p>
<p>"After marriage, there is only one year to accommodate happiness!" A friend said with emotion after seeing a wedding invitation on his desk. He had been married for a year because, a year later, he had a child. For the sake of the child, his wife had to leave her job, so they had to cope with increased expenses with half of their previous income. Also, they could no longer go to the cinema together, and they no longer heard them singing in harmony under the moonlight. Life suddenly became monotonous and clumsy.</p>
<p>Therefore, when he saw a wedding invitation, he had to say that there was only one year to accommodate happiness after marriage.</p>
<p>It seems that it was like this in the past, and it is the same today. Unless one can seize wealth by cunning means, most people have always suffered from the burden of family and felt that it was a heavy burden. Although some people advocate celibacy, it seems that one cannot help but have a family. Moreover, in modern times, many people are not afraid of marriage. Cooperation between two people is better than living alone. Assuming that both have abilities and have jobs, then the happiness after marriage will not be damaged by economic difficulties.</p>
<p>Therefore, the problem lies with the child.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I went to another friend's house. He had a house bought with gold bars, and he had a well-paying job. He had been married for many years and had five children. All day long, he was disturbed by the children. When I went to see him, he was really troubled by the children's crying. Of course, he had also been troubled by all the children's issues, such as education, food, and clothing. Seeing me, he said: "If you get married, you must never have children." This was an important supplement to his previous repeated urging of me to get married.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, rather than saying the burden of family, it is more concrete and appropriate to say the burden of children. Without children, a small family can generally maintain its good condition. Once there is a child, the situation will become bleak. This is also a serious social issue. Today, childcare centers are not widespread, and even if there are any, they are not in good condition or are commercialized. This burden will make a small family unable to move and will make the male and female protagonists in our small family miserable. However, getting married without having children is like climbing a tree to catch fish. No wonder contraceptive drugs and books are selling so widely.</p>
<p>Today, there is such a phenomenon that many young men and women of marriageable age are hesitant to get married and dare not get married because they fear life, especially the life after having children. But in the end, they cannot create a celibate era forever or an era without children. Nor can we let young people always sigh that there is only one year to accommodate happiness after marriage.</p>
<p>Then, the most important thing is to make this society so perfect that people do not feel the burden of children. However, if everything about the children remains the responsibility of individual families—the father and mother—if children are still regarded as private property and not recognized as the new generation of the larger society, then everyone will doubt the happy family of the future.</p>

<p>A pure art and literary monthly magazine "Genesis" will be published at the end of this month. The editor is Xue Shan.</p>
<h3>Methods of Criticizing People</h3>
<p>— Wang Naizhi</p>
<p>While chatting with a friend, we talked about the recent passing away of Venerable Zhenhua and Fuhai. We were deeply saddened by the premature death of such outstanding monks. We felt that such talented monks had unlimited potential, and if they could live for another ten or twenty years, their achievements would surely be even more magnificent and illuminating for eternity. However, they suddenly passed away due to their usual lack of attention to health or contracting smallpox. This caused incalculable damage to the future of Dharma propagation, which is heartbreaking. Therefore, for the Dharma, it is a matter that monks should pay close attention to.</p>
<p>In connection, we talked about Master ××. The master was also an outstanding monk of extraordinary intelligence who died young. This happened twenty years ago. It is said that he returned to China not long ago and was (unclear) by a mentor. He was so angry that he became depressed and died. (Unclear), it is said that he was young (unclear) (died at the age of twenty-four). Even the slightest anger could not be withstood, so of course he was not great material. In fact, young people (unclear) be angry (unclear) again, the (unclear) is not (unclear), but (unclear) to be angry shows a lack of capacity, how can this be considered ordinary? I often hear people say that to guide people, one must have skillful means, and to persuade people to do good, one must understand the threshold of gradual guidance. To correct other people's mistakes, one must avoid pointing them out directly. I often made this mistake in the past, offending many people and (unclear) many things. I still thought I was innocent. My motive was to guide people to do good and to eliminate (unclear) delusions. Now that I think about it, it's really nonsense. How could I have even a little understanding of other people's views? How could I have even a little compassion and pity for people? I thought my knowledge was correct and that my knowledge was higher than theirs, and I naturally had the qualification to teach people. Therefore, after hearing other people's (unclear) theory, I felt that this was wrong, that was wrong, errors were everywhere, it was all wrong. So I couldn't help it, I wanted to do good, (unclear) him a little, (unclear) a little, (unclear) the other person's face, and also put (unclear) the air of (unclear). -A wave of justice (unclear), emotion (unclear), (unclear) the other party (unclear) to realize that he (unclear) is unteachable, I (unclear), no (unclear) scolding no matter how (unclear) to (unclear) (unclear) is very embarrassing, even more so for young people who love to be strong.</p>
<p>Some people say that good medicine tastes bitter, and loyal words are unpleasant to the ear. In fact, what tastes bitter is not necessarily good medicine. Arsenic and poison are also bitter. What is unpleasant to the ear is not necessarily loyal words; enemy propaganda and heavy taxes are also unpleasant to the ear. Conversely, the sugar-coated (unclear), which is not bitter, are all tonic agents sold in pharmacies. The Buddhist scriptures, which are not unpleasant to the ear and are full of skillful metaphors, are not treacherous words. Sugar coating is a means of convenience, the two and three vehicles, and the arm metaphors and words are all convenient. In order to pay attention to convenience, the Buddha spent forty-nine years, used all his skills, and said so many scriptures. The wisdom of us ordinary people, compared to that of the Buddha, is so vastly different, but we do not pay attention to skillful means and often directly scold people, still thinking it is compassion (unclear), it is really arrogant and conceited to the extreme. Knowledge is a kind of sin (unclear). The more people read the scriptures, the deeper their knowledge is, and the easier it is to see the faults of others. The clearer the distinction is, the stronger the impulse to criticize people is. I think (unclear) is not the expression of (unclear), but the venting of "anger", the manifestation of the arrogance that "I am more upright than you" and "I know (unclear) more than you".</p>
