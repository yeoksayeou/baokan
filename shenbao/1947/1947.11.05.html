<h3>晋南民衆　紛起抗匪　以鍬鋤爲武器</h3>
<p>〔本報太原三日電〕鄉寗城繼吉縣城後被匪攻陷，守軍轉至鄕村，繼續抗匪。永濟第四區民衆不堪共匪蹂躪紛起以鋤頭鐮刀自衛，十月十三日集至三千餘，以少數槍支配以鍬鋤，在曾充靑年軍之秦中和領導下，攻佔軍村，毀匪區公所，並殺各村「算老賬」流氓三四十人，更進佔趙村，收復風陵渡，迄廿日未得援軍，趙村遭匪圍攻，激戰兩　夜，彈盡被匪攻陷，未脫圍者多被刺死，並對民衆報復，殃及附近東竹等數村，剜眼　足，石擊棒打，致死人民數百，已成路無行人之恐怖局面。</p>

<h3>台灣永久屬祖國　楊嘉痛斥菲荒謬主張　菲外交部否認會反對球歸我</h3>
<p>菲外交部否認曾反對琉球歸我</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕菲律賓馬尼刺公報，主張台灣實行「自決」，此間各方對於此項故意抹殺事實之建議，深感　異，台灣重建協會理事長楊擊嘉氏，四日特對記者發表談話稱：台灣永遠爲中國之領土，台灣人民盡屬黃帝之子孫，雖經日寇五十餘年之暴力統治，其純潔之血統，始終未變，菲報之建議如果屬實，誠屬荒誕不經，余信台灣人民無一願意脫離祖國之懷抱。台灣於八年抗戰後，得以重返祖國，台省同胞無不感覺興奮，雖然其後事實之發展，未能盡符台胞之希望，因此遂引起外間種種之謠傳，但余可斷言台胞絕無脫離祖國之傾向，二百八十年前鄭成功之率領台胞反抗滿淸，保衛台灣，艱苦奮鬥，與且寇侵佔後丘逢甲等無數先烈，前仆後繼，力圖恢復失土之壯烈史實，永爲台胞之光榮，今日之台胞無疑必將追隨彼等祖先之足跡，爲保衛台灣，重建台灣而努力。</p>
<p>〔中央社馬尼刺四日電〕菲外部頃發表一簡短聲明，否認昨日馬尼刺公報所截消息。該聲明稱：「菲國任何外交官員，均未會發表此種聲明，且亦未有任何外交官員，準備基於所傅之理由，採取關於反對中國要求之步驟，所傳之理由謂：菲國反對中國之要求，乃因設如琉球羣島置於單一外國之完全統治下，琉球對菲律賓之戰略位置，或可危及菲國之地位」。（馬尼刺公報又發謬論內容刊二版二攔）</p>
<h3>我即派員赴美　接收贈我艦艇　政付接收員費用</h3>

<h3>立院聯席會決議　郵政法無庸修正</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕交部爲簡化郵資加價手續。前所建議修正郵政法第四條，以後郵資調整，僅須交部擬定送政院核定，即見諸實施，不必再經立法程序，此案四日晨於立院經濟。財政。法制三委會聯席會審査時，交部郵電司長陶鳳山及郵政總局高級職員薛雅文等咸列席說明，據稱：郵局年來虧損極巨，按估計即平信增至三千元，每月仍將虧損五百億，若全由國庫貼補，間接增加人民負擔，因之唯有採取補貼及加價雙管齊下政策，惟過去每次調整，例須經過立法程序，往往立院尚未通過，而物價又漲，爲簡化手續計，乃有此種建議，此外，全經會擬有一公用事業加價計算方式，郵資調整似亦可援用。繼由各立委發言，指出立院過去對郵資調整雖有質詢，然尚無稽延情事，故不足以此爲修改郵政法之理由。一部份立委對郵局糜費公帑，建築漂亮郵局，深致不滿，並主張應由當局蒞院說明整個財政政策。最後決議，郵政法第四條無庸修正，以後郵資增加，仍須完成立法程序。</p>
<h3>行局庫合併案　立院財經會重付審査</h3>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕四行兩局一庫台併案，四日晨由立院財。經兩委會再付審査，李慶　報告歷次審查經過，說明各該行局代表咸認此時合併恐將影響金融，减少僑匯，同時，實行時技術上亦困難綦多，主張緩議，于振瀛等認技術困難不成其爲理由，至僑匯無法吸收，純係當局外匯政策錯誤之結果，咸主應予合併，決議重付審査。</p>

<h3>糧食業課徵營業稅問題</h3>
<p>糧食業應否課徵營業稅這一個問題，關係實在相當重要。從我們過去及現行的政策上，不難看出政府對食糧一業所取的課稅方針：</p>
<p>釐金一稱百貨稅，因爲它對於各種貨物，都要抽厘的；但糧食獨准邀免；</p>
<p>凡進口貨物，按照海關稅則，除極少數的例外之外，亦是一律要課稅的；但米麵粉等糧食，亦向在免稅之列。</p>
<p>每逢水旱災荒，民食發生嚴重問題時，火車輸船等運輸機構，且每每特减運費，優先運送。本市市政府所頒獎勵採米辦法，迄今亦還沒有取消。</p>
<p>糧食何以會獲得如此優惠待遇？這答案很簡單，就是：「食爲民天」，關係一般人的生活和幸福之故。在我國向稱爲吃飯問題，在外國則稱爲麵包問題。這問題是一切政治和經濟問題的核心，也是一切國內和國際問題的焦點。倘或措置不善，或應付無方，很容易釀成不可收拾的災變。故勝利以後，中央曾把糧食業的營業稅緩征一年，嗣又再准延期一年，至本年九月底始期滿，這也可見當局重視民食的一斑。</p>
<p>現在再度展緩之期已屆滿了，各地糧食業公會和全國商聯會分別呼籲的結果，還沒有發生效力，於是業中人驚惶起來，一般人的視錢，也漸漸地注意起來了。這是由於農產物的運銷，從生產者到消費者的手裏，共問輾轉太多，據業中人宣稱，自產地經碾米商，批發商，販運商，經營商，銷地批發商，及零售商，其間須經過六道轉手，而每一道轉手，卽是一次營業，卽須依照營業稅法，完納一道百分之一。五的營業稅；而其所謂百分之一。五的稅率，又是依照銷貨額計算的。那末，一祖米的原飴成本，假定是六十萬元的話，依照每次加上貨値百分之一。五的結果，經過六次轉手，其他開支，姑且一概不算，已經要高到六十五萬六千零六十五元，方纔够本。所以名義上，雖說値百抽一。五，實際已經要到値百抽九。一强。在這力求抑平米價，安定民牛的時侯，此項免稅期限，是否應予截止，確乎値得重視的。</p>
<p>照常理論，凡屬國民，均有納稅之義務，糧商同屬國民一分子，自亦有其應盡之職責。問題是在於同一貨物，竟須重複課稅至六道之多，這一點，究竟於法於理，是否說得過去，却不容過於忽視。在中張課稅的人，當然可以說：這是課於糧商的，不是課於糧食的，因而不　成所謂重複課稅。但事實上是照營業鉗貨額計算的，其性質與買賣稅並沒有二致。依租稅轉嫁的結果，這項重複課稅，無疑地仍須一概歸結到食戶身上。因此，無論如何轉變，實際終不免重複課稅。</p>
<p>上項重複課稅，卽照營業稅的本法來看，原則上也似乎不許可的。本年五月問所修正的營業稅法第二條，列舉免稅的營業凡七項，其第四項爲「已納出廠稅或出產稅之工廠或出產人」。試問是項工廠或出產人，何故許其免稅？是不是爲他們「已納出廠稅或出產稅」的綠故？食糧同是物產，至少在經過碾米廠碾白以後，亦不能不算是出廠或出產，何故仍須再四重複課稅？這是否與立法的原意相背？</p>
<p>依照修正營業稅法第二條，第七項，「肩挑負販，經營米，穀，雜糧，菜蔬，家禽等之小本營業，」概許免稅。可見米，穀，雜糧的營業稅，本來可以豁免的。所不許免的，祇是範圍較大，不是小本營業的糧商。却不知就營業者的立塲來說，固有範圍大小之別，而就營業的對象卽糧食來說，官並沒有應免應征可分；因爲轉嫁結果，終究要落到用戶身上去的。徒然在最後一關的零售商方面，免除了一小部份營業稅，這與大衆並無何等深切的關係，適見糧食免稅政策的不澈底罷了　按照家計調查，凡屬收入較少的家庭，共於糧食部份所消耗的成分，照例特別大。所以鄉問工資，現在往往拿米或米價來計算。在都市方面，大部份，雖已改照生活指數發給，但是供給膳食，或另發米貼的，實際上，也還是不少。可見食米問題，關係確很重要。今中央和各省市地方政府，正在多方設法，壓平米價，籍以安定社會，譬如限價議價咧，取締囤積投機咧，嚴禁走私出境咧，實行大量拋售咧，發給平價配米咧，籌議全盤配給咧，提先趕運糧食咧，保護採辦米商咧，不許沿途留難勒紫咧，這許多辦法，形式不同，目標則一。那末，在這米價正在動盪之時，忽然把原已免征的糧食，在營業稅的名義之下，再三重複課起稅來，這和政府原定的決策是否相符，很盼望主管當局能够愼密地重加考慮。須知從前萬惡的厘金，在節次改善之後，到後來，亦祇課得一道；一稅之後，便任其所之，不再重征。這在本省境內，至少可以辦到如此。今以昔日厘金所特免的糧食，至節節重征，至於五六道，這總似無可理解的事。因此，在安定民生的呼號下，糧食業應否課微營業稅這一個問題，實在値得我們的重視。</p>

<h3>亞蒙勳爵在穗廣播</h3>
<p>（上接一版）其中對我國大學及其他文化機關於最惡劣情形下，作極英勇之奮鬥，備極識譽。渠幷稱讚我國各地之善後及建設工作，尤以重慶爲然。亞氏論及共產黨之叛亂謂：「中國之稅收如仍有百分之八十用於勘亂，則恢復正常情形之希望，即遭阻遏且幾爲不可能者，但人人咸能料及額外之負擔，刻均在勇敢應付之中。論及該國之在我國旅行謂：「吾人對貴國　當之天然資源，糧食生產與工業發展之所有潛力，極爲嘆佩，而尤應讚譽者，即谷大學及其他敎育機關內負責敎育工作之人士，彼等雖有建築殘毀設備不全等重大阻礙，然仍勇敢克服巨大困難，俾使下一代得以完成學業，負起更艱巨之賣任。該團對老百姓之動苦耐勞永存之愉快及和氣，亦極感動。渠謂：曾見及中國全國之庸大生產力，在華英僑已告訪華團，彼等將盡力與中國合作，不使中國失望。亞氏末謂：「吾人返國在即，今已具有更深層之認識，即我等兩國問之友誼將永久連繫」。</p>
<p>〔中央社廣州四日電〕英國會訪華團長亞蒙勳爵，否認該團係直接從事調查此問之中英貿易前途者。亞　動爵係批評美國一通訊社自南京之報道，據稱：「英議會訪華團乃一友誼訪問團，訪華團在此間，僅爲中國政府之資客」。</p>
<h3>馬尼刺公報又發謬論</h3>
<p>竟贊成託管琉球台灣</p>
<p>〔中央社馬尼刺四日電〕美人經營之馬尼刺公報今日者論贊成聯合國託管琉球羣島之建議，並提議以類似性之託管施諸台灣。據該報稱：中國要求擁有琉球羣島之理由，殆基於一簡單事實，即大琉球及琉球羣島其餘諸島，於上古期間，曾一度屬於中國，但大琉球之戰役，確曾犧牲甚多美國士兵生命，故美國似不可能準備同意交出琉球羣島。又稱：聯合國之託管，將可界予大琉球以其過去歷史中所未曾事有之自決程度，並可獲予大琉球人其本身未能担負之保護力量。關於台灣，該報稱：「朝鮮人民之獨立自決，目前已成爲一世界性問題，且爲國際政治上最爲棘手問題之一，但尚未聞有人以同一自決原則，施無合灣之言論，蓋台灣人一如大琉球人，在戰前多年來，即在日本統治之下，台灣人如被徵詢及對此問題之意見，彼等或表示寗願　續受巾國統治，但彼等從未獲有任何機會，在世界性組織中，對此問題，表示其意見。</p>

<p>〔中央社新加坡四日電〕我總領事伍伯勝及華僑記者，今晨復訪問被阻於聖約翰島海港外等候檢疫之我僑民，渠等卒接受勸告，停止絕食，惟僅同意接受華僑團體捐助之食物，仍拒絕檢疫當局所供給者。同時渠等提出不滿之點及若干要求，促當地政府注意。渠等耍求檢疫站將來予我僑胞以公平待遇及改善膳宿，俾從來同胞不致忍受同等痛苦，幷要求立即爲入境華僑施行醫藥檢查，俾得早離據疫站。當地政府代表允立即予以調查，伍氏將　續進行交涉。今日記者團訪問之後，頗證實僑胞之怨言。檢疫站誠如擁擠不堪之瘋人院，二百餘人分用一吸水機，及分食不足量之食米及腐爛之蕃薯外，另加少量他種食品。</p>

<h3>馬來新憲草案　含意抑制華僑</h3>
<p>劉維熾稱我己注意</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〔僑委會委員長劉維熾，四日就馬來華僑爲反對馬來亞聯邦新憲制草案而罷工，罷市事發表談話，略謂：該草案大部爲英政府之主張，馬來之居民，不論英人，印人，馬來人及中國人，均對之不滿，華僑反對該草案之愛點有四；　草案規定本人及父母均出生馬來，居住該地十五年以上者，方可取得公民資格，否則必須經聯邦高級委員核准，此種防制，使華僑要享公民權者寥寥無幾，。華僑人數佔馬來總人口百分之四十以上，但聯邦立法會議犧會七十五名中，僅得十四席，不及比例百分之廿，殊久公允，　草案陳明馬來人對移民享有特權，有限制其他民族（尤以華僑）移入之趨勢，　華僑二百三十餘萬中居住新加坡者達六十餘萬，如依草案，新加坡與聯邦分院，華僑在聯邦中將淪爲少數民族。劉氏宣稱：「華僑過去對於馬來亞之偉大貢獻，舉世界。知，英人亦莫不承認，在該牛島淪陷期間，華僑生命財產犧牲最大，固無論矣。即馬來亞光復以後，對於地方之安定，秩序之恢復，華僑亦多老績，然華僑所希望者無他，公平與合理之待遇耳。今談新意制提案，竟含有抑制華僑之意，誠屬憾事」。劉氏並種：「此事開係馬來亞華僑前途甚大，國人已密切加以注意，蓋此不僅爲二百餘萬馬來亞華僑被抑問題，亦爲整個中華民族之生存問題」。</p>

<h3>范登堡演說詞（上接一版）</h3>
<p>渠稱：「人必須坦白檢討吾人自己之資源，以免損及吾人木身之經濟，吾人必須確保健全之行政與適當之合作，吾人不能規避領袖地位之責任，除非吾人準備接受喪失此種領袖地位之代價」。</p>
<p>關於世界前途者，范登堡押擊蘇聯之否決權，稱其已使聯合國安理　幾陷於麻痺狀態，並使對德和約之草擬延遲。渠稱：「德國可以恢復其可以生活之百治制度，乃係歐洲復典之關鍵，外長會議對此問題如獲協議，實屬不勝企盼者。惟余以爲意見不和——無論在此間或在其他地圖——不可任其長久延阻和平，復興及自治政府。和平應具有優先權，余不能相信德國和約會犧見不能覓得大多數同意之共同基礎」。</p>
<p>范登堡認爲，最近里約熱內盧會議爲各國間合作之範例，同時渠並指出聯合國製造全世界和諧之目標。渠批評蘇聯所使用之　次否決權稱：「大多數並非一定正確，惟如相信彼發自全世界良心之大多數意見爲繼續不斷之錯誤，實亦對於基本邏輯之曲解」。范登堡稱：渠贊成「吾人生存並使他人生存」，全世界裁軍，並依賴聯合國以維持和平。渠稱：蘇聯最近之聲明，乃係「從未如此痛擊全世界耳鼓之最驚人之反美毀謗。」</p>
<p>渠繼稱：「據云吾人係法西斯份子，但事實上吾人乃維持言論自由及遷舉由由者，甚至並努力爲詆毀吾人者維持此等自由。據云吾人乃經濟之帝國主義，但實際上吾人曾以巨量數十萬萬元之物資，租借與吾人之盟友。彼等又云，吾人乃係戰爭販子，然則吾人雖有原子炸彈，亦仍請求全世界與吾人共同禁止原子戰爭一。</p>
<p>范登堡重申對於團結一致之美國外交政策之信心，並稱：「外交政策乃係吾人公民公開辯論中之合法主題，外交政策屬於人民，並爲各黨競爭之合法項目，惟余願熱烈祈禱，希望吾人爲永無黨派之美國外交政策而努力，此外，外交政策並非共和黨者，亦非民主黨者，而係美國者，此外交政策將使我人民於危機之前團結一致」。</p>

<p>〔合衆社柏林三日電）柏林英美蘇消息靈通方面樂觀之情緒日增，以爲即將在倫教舉行之四外長會議，至少能獲局部成功。德國由東西兩大勢力予以分裂之可能，頃已幾乎無人置信。僅一月前，此數方面以爲四外長會議西方國家及蘇聯間不可能有協調有在。由於過去三星期中，蘇報對英美之攻繫大見緩和，各方面之觀點遂告改變。克萊前時宣佈擬以最有力之宣傳，與共產主義作戰，使德人明瞭民主思想與行動之方式，英國可能默然效法。然大多數柏林英美消息靈通之觀察家相信，蘇聯擬作若干讓步，以維持德國之統一而避免東西間之堅固　溝。如東西分裂，壁壘森嚴，蘇聯由德國傳播共產主義越荷此而深入法國之目的，將大爲不利。美國某外交碩宿稱，「與蘇聯交涉不可短視，蘇聯不會放棄通往德國西部及魯爾區之門戶，魯爾銅鐵出產對蘇人極爲重要，彼等爲第一流之生意人。」蘇聯政策有極大之轉變，致美國有資格之政治觀察家某君稱，蘇外長莫洛托夫在倫敦會議以前去職極有可能。渠承認此乃極端之見解，然警告稱，對此可能不能忽視，甚至甫自莫斯科返此之蘇人亦感覺德國之統一將有驚人之發展。彼等堅稱，西方國家之悲觀實無根據，四外長而臨之德國諸問題當可解決。柏林觀察家感覺克林姆宮業已決定，與西方盟國早獲協議之時己至，彼等相信蘇聯無力作戰，目前亦不希望戰爭。</p>

<h3>根據日本憲法規定　片山哲罷黜平野</h3>
<p>社會黨內部分裂表面化</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京四日電〕日政府頃發表片山首相書面談話稱：因平野農相拒絕自動職之提議，不得不根據憲法規定，行使罷免權，將平野晨相免職。在最相未　任前，暫以首相兼任。然平野問題雖已告一段落，但非僅平野本身及「全農」系將永與西尾派背道而馳，即衆院議長松岡駒吉　同屬右派之溫和人士，亦將有憤憤難平之感。</p>
<p>片山內閣岌岌可危</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京四日電〕日首相片山哲今晨正式宣佈將　相平野免職後，已引起政治風潮，左右各派政黨均表反對，內閣或有垮台之處。據平野聲稱，此舉不合民主，本人將向社會黨中央委員會提出討論。下院農民同盟議員約卅人則立即要求決定其是否違反憲法問題，自由黨與共產黨亦紛紛響應。僅民主黨等尚守緘默。</p>

<p>西尾指責平野叛黨</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京四日電〕內閣書記長西尾四日說明罷免農相之理由稱：平野農相之言行成爲問題者，爲其前在奈良謂應解散國會而實行總選舉，又如十月十五日對外國記者謂煤礦國家管理法案將被委員會否決，全體會議上亦將不能通過，其時是闌將總辭職。此外並有與其他黨派聯繫，而共同行動之事實。</p>

<p>〔中央社福州四日電〕據甫自爪哇返國之僑商談稱：戰後南洋各地殖民地政府，仍未改旣往之愚民政策，最顯著者如吸毒。如爪哇荷闌政府，對鴉片採行官　政策，表面上當地政府對吸毒者規定必須向政府登記，實際上對殖民地政府實爲一項可觀之收入。一般華僑甚望我政府能促使聯合國注意此一問題。</p>

<h3>戰爭製造者悲歡悲歡離合！　華僑們的故事（下）</h3>
<p>波闌行第九信·本報特派員毛樹淸</p>
<p>據尹作漁事後遇見他們的鄰居屈魯卡絲都克女士（波　人）的叙述，大致是這樣：</p>
<p>八月二十日的早晨，有波闌的「革命軍」若干人，來到杜戶咖路五十九號搜查軍火，並且搬　華僑住宅內屯積的貨物，尹徐兩人因爲據理力爭，被革命軍帶到司令邵，經過一度審訊，認爲並無問謀嫌疑，遂即釋放。尹徐倆人，以爲從此無事，也便不介意此事。不料第二天（八月二十一日）早最，有號稱「波闌革命軍」的武裝士兵數人，重到五十九號，將尹彩池徐顯貴，押到隔鄰五十七號園子內，迫令倆人用泥鏟自掘土坑，然後槍殺，掩士　長而去。</p>
<p>魯卡絲都克願意作這件命案的「證人〕，無論在任何塲合，她都願意出庭作證。她說：在槍殺的前一秒鐘，她還上前攔阻，也挨了「武裝」暴徒的毆打。那時候，尹作漁被德國軍人押解到德國做苦工，一直到納粹投降才回華沙來，在華沙廢墟上，遇到了那位　魯卡絲都克女士，才知道了這件寃案。</p>
<p>事後，尹作漁發掘了五十七號的屍坑，「慘哪，彩池身上有兩槍，顯貴身上挨了六槍！」</p>
<p>尹作漁告訴我說：「最可恨的是；這位兇手現在還在波瀾政府做官，」他是聽屈魯卡女士講的。他說：「大使館曾經向波闌政府交涉懲兇，但音訊杳如黃鶴！」</p>
<p>我因爲離開華沙倉促，沒有詳細採訪這件事的始末，故事的始末，大部份是尹作漁　的，還有另外幾位華僑的補充。尹彩池還有一個名字呌「尹保林」，徐顯貴有時也寫作「徐獻」。波瀾的華僑都認識「保林」和「戲　」他們會異口同聲說：」死得慘」！</p>
<p>我還遇見一位「死裏逃生」的英雄邱廷進，他從波闌收復區（德國東部割　區）的南　城來華沙着我。一九四五年一月，俄羅斯軍隊衝進德國南部，那時候，他和另一位華僑陳立訓，住在德國南部的克拉貝茲城，被俄國軍隊拘捕起來，他們說德國話，表明他們是中國人，「同盟國人民應該受保護」，因爲語言不通，俄國士兵置之不理，並且撕毀他們兩本護照，被押解到俄國的伏羅希洛夫斯基城，被罰苦役，冬天，遍地冰雪，他們都衣不蔽體，飯食粗糙，不能果腹，就道樣，陳立訓被凍死在「勞動營」裏。邱廷進因爲身體强壯，挨盡了萬苦千幸，逃出了牢獄。</p>
<p>邱延進現在有若干位「共患難」的國際朋友，他說：在伏羅希洛夫斯基，有五個法國人，凍餓死了四個。七位捷克人，死了六個，中國人剛個，死了一個。其秘的德國人波闌人很多，生死的數字，他記憶不淸了。他還說，他常常想念陳立訓，每次當他　及陳立訓死時的慘况，食不下咽。</p>
<p>戰爭造成了許多華僑的悲劇，也製造了不少喜劇。有位波蘭小城市裏的華僑，因爲經商，戰前認識了若于猶太人，一九三九年以前，猶太人控制着整個的經濟命脈，銀行，公司，百貨商店，房地產，凡是規模較大的波闌企業，都操縱在猶太人手裏。一九三九年九月，希特勒大舉僅入波闌，很多猶太人都猝不及防，倉促中逃命。那位華僑，因爲平紊的「信用」著稱，接受了很多猶太人寄存的金銀珍寳，　明事變平定以後交還，並予酬謝。波闌是猶太人簽納粹屠殺最狠毒的地方，許多「寄戶」，都一去無消息，死於非命。那位華僑接受的無主財產，據說爲數可觀。</p>
<p>就一般講，現在在波瀾的四十七位華僑，處境都不算頂壞，農產品多，糧價便宜，謀生之道比較容易，有位華僑說得很坦白，「儘管環境如何艱難，找點喫飯錢，還是容易」。因此，如果政府沒有特開的「接僑專輪」來迎接他們，他們還是願意留幾年再說。</p>
<p>大部份的華僑，都娶有波闌籍的妻室，並且生育子女。據我所知道的，祇有一位以捐款愛國最著稱的麻廷申光生，帶有一位中國太太在波闌，麻廷申計劃回祖國去，他說：祗要他能賺錢，他一定要分一半捐給國家，他認得很少幾個字，但是他深知道：「沒有國家的保護，個人，發室，子女，都是空的」！</p>
<p>祖國畢竟還是在儘量保護他們的，大使館「光復」以後，葆近甫代辦和使館的工作人員，隨時和他們接觸，並且解決他們的困難。大體而論，他們目前經營的商業和工業，多半能相當貿利，特別是皮革工業和皮鞋業。</p>
<p>我參觀過他們一座皮鞋工塲，二十多名波蘭的男女工人，除了極簡單的機械以外，大部份多用手工，他們用帆布和皮革，鑲嵌縫合，是華僑老　敎給他們的。除此以外，斯坦丁有幾位華僑，經營旅館業，有位旅館老　朱漢停，因爲開旅館需要應酬和交際，他和斯坦丁警察局上自局長，下至員警，都有深厚的「友誼」。</p>
<p>中國人畢竟聰明，全世界都有中國人的足跡，凡是中國人足跡踏過的地方，都會生根，開花，和結果。我跑遜亞洲，非洲，歐洲和美洲，每次當我會見那些　洋出來的中國同胞，看到他們在當地汗血奮鬥所培植出來的事業，　自感無窮的慚愧，無限的敬佩！（完）</p>

<h3>戰犯畏罪　對中美表示感激　否認曾參加戰爭</h3>
<p>原田清一今年五十五歲，日本海軍兵學校出身，明治三十九年參加海軍，已有數十年服務資歷。容貌舉止，已現老態。記者即請一歸僑通譯，談話如次：　對中國政府及人民有何感想？答：對中國政府除感激之外，無話可說；特別對於蔣主席之以德報怨，更是感謝敬佩。以本人身受者言，中國海軍接收廈門時態度之和善，出於我人想像之外，特別感激。中日兩國，由於地理形勢及其他原因，將來必須合作。　日本之復興需時多少年？答：如聯合國能繼續對日本援助，則日本不久可成爲很民主化的國家。</p>
<p>日本政制應爲君主制抑民主制，天皇是否需要？答：日本已戰敗，一切不必說了。日本只有民主化一條出路。又日本因有特殊之風俗習慣，人民思想已天皇爲中心，故即使實行民主，亦需天皇，而今日之天皇已充滿民主思想。　日本人民對美國印象如何？答：日本人現在生活方式全向美國學習，日本已發生糧荒數次，全仗美國救濟，故一般人民對美國甚爲感謝。　試述在華作戰之經過。答：根本沒有參加。本人於昭和十三年九月至上海，十四年回國，昭和十七年再奉派至廈門供戰，「對於戰爭沒有伸一隻手」。不過在廈門時，部下可能有作惡行動，我不知道。此次來華受正大光明之審判後，常益深悔過之心。其餘三犯，均謂以彰言經過上海，但未逃留。</p>
<p>四犯抵滬後，即移交戰犯管理處。隨船來華之日籍船員四十四人，將暫住日俘福利委員會內，候使船返國。歸僑則由僑務委員會上海辦事處負責招待，將就其經濟情况，分別處理。</p>

<h3>冬令救濟經費　決按目標籌集</h3>
<p>跑馬賽恐得不償失</p>
<p>沈宗濂嘆熱心人少</p>
<p>關於冬令救濟事宜，業經參談會通過四項籌款辦法，其中收入可能最大者當屬跑馬慈善賽一項，惟據跑馬總會方面稱：跑馬廳之修理費爲數至巨，恐慈賽所得之經費，僅敷修建費用，將得不償失。倘所言屬實，殆將影響原計劃之進行。惟昨據市府沈秘書長宗濂表示，市府決以全力辦理變更减少，惟我人痛心者，乃本市各慈善機關服務精神有遜於戰前，熱心之情緒亦較差，而有錢者復多專求個人過份享受，如一冬令救　事宜，對所需經費，無論如何務期　　預定目的，故賽馬即使成問題，其原定之救濟計劃，及所需之　　，決不因此而舞六七千萬元者，時有所聞，而於救濟指款，則反多觀望。當知救濟難胞，固不獨爲政府之責任，市民亦應羣策羣力。至此次擬設之兩庇寒所，原定一在漕河涇，一借中紡紗廠所屬之舊日華紗廠原址，中紡藉辭推託，拒絕借用，此原爲敵產公物，國營紗廠似亦不應有此舉云。</p>

<h3>仇連環被暗殺案　隔別審訊五被五被告</h3>
<p>仇母要求賠償四萬萬</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕高士滿舞稽查仇連　，於本年六月一日午夜一時，在福州路大西洋菜社前，被流氓多人暗殺案，經警局將正兇及帮兇項銀泉等十四名拘獲，解送地檢處偵訊完學，提起公訴後，於八月九日在地院初審一過，被告等成否認行兇，昨日上午復在地院刑九庭由曹祖　推事續審項銀泉，毛慶雲，陳永貴，包永發，盛樹根等五人。首由證人汪愛香稱係被告葉東英之未婚妻，被告陳永貴之寄女，葉在南方劇塲常收票員，</p>
<p>安分守己</p>
<p>不會參預殺仇事。繼即隔別審訊各被告，據盛樹根供稱，「本案正兇封仁義任職戲院時，因仇連業常往看白戲，爲封所拒，兩人因此不睦，殺仇是封所計劃。五月卅日晚我在同典園吃茶，遇見白　痢和封仁義，叫我同往浴室洗澡，當時封曾說「要觸仇的霉頭」。計議之後，六月一日晚我們七八人在大西洋菜社遇仇，由一個江北人上去將仇抱住，</p>
<p>出槍射擊</p>
<p>傷人，我即砍他一刀，我並不認識魏曉陽和葉東英。」嗣傳項銀泉供稱：「六月一日小皮鞋（按係另一兇手之綽號）喚我到旅館去，出來復到一品香吃點心，打仇時我亦去的，給仇開槍打傷，子彈由背部進，胸口出，我遂砍他一刀，毛慶雲也砍他一刀，盛樹根砍不砍我未看見。」毛慶雲供述常日情形與項所供略伺，但謂殺仇是白　痢的意思，因白的師兄弟張興賓在今年年初五被害，係仇所指使，爲白　痢探知，遂</p>
<p>代張報仇</p>
<p>云云。其餘二被告陳永貴，包永發均矢口否認殺仇。至此仇母所延律師向庭上提出附帶民訴，要求賠償損失四億一千一百萬元，庭論本業尚須調查，改期再審，五被告還押提籃橋上海監獄。按被告等原押地院看守所，因在所不守規則，會　發動囚犯絕食，現　押期滿，院方以尚未審結，特延長三月，移解上海監獄　押。</p>

<h3>筱伶自殺案偵訊　冷山交殷實浦保　檢察官懷疑三點　密告信敘述尤奇　署名「不平人」指張春帆謀害</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕越劇名女伶筱丹桂自殺案，承辦該案檢察官陳壽陶昨日首次開庭偵訊。自上午九時三十分起至十一時三十分始訊畢，結果張春帆還押，金兆元（冷山）交保，其餘證人均飭回。昨傳到應訊人除冷山外，尚有筱伶之妹錢瓊韻，國泰越劇院編導吳琛，劉濤，皇后越劇院經理沈益　，越劇聯誼會常務理事陳德來，越劇名伶袁雪芬，至筱伶之兄錢伯仇，及魏闌芳均未到。張春帆自思南路看守所中提出，着咖啡色夾袍，面容憔悴，冷山着　嘰西裝，鼻御眼鏡。袁雪芬着灰色呢旗抱，罩白絨綫外套，面帶病容。張春帆之供詞與前自白書相同，惟有　點，察官極爲注意，即上月八日張與筱丹桂發生口角後，曾找冷山評理，在汽車中對冷山說：「筱丹桂假如要自殺，你得要負責任。」昨訊問冷山及證人吳琛，均證明確有化語。是張明知筱有自殺之動機，而不加以預防，殊有罪嫌。又筱於十三日下午服來沙而自殺後，用三輪車送至中美醫院，未用汽車或急救車，致時間遲延，挽救無術，亦不能辭其咎。八日下午冷山，吳琛，劉濤等至筱伶處，見筱之大衣襟有撕開痕跡，證明張有虐待嫌疑，至冷山係此案發生之主要關係人，亦　交殷費　保一家。袁雪芬則稱局外人，惟因筱死得太慘，故以結拜姊妹關係，講求法院伸雪。錢瓊韻仍稱姊與張感情頗佳，平時亦無爭執。聞此案情形業已明瞭，日內即將偵查終結。</p>

<h3>五萬元大鈔之謎</h3>
<p>蘭州央行經理楊霄靑氏一席談</p>
<p>〔本報　州一日航訊〕外間盛傳甘，新一帶已有五萬元大鈔行使一節，實無其事。惟近來闌州市面頭寸短絀，中央銀行關州分行之本票，已再度出現市面，市民頗感不便。記者爲此特訪此問中央銀行經理楊　靑，　詢上述現象　結及五萬元大鈔是已準備應市。據楊氏稱：依照向例，發行局美發行一種新鈔票時，必先通知各分支行，並附送新鈔樣本，本行最近並宋接到是項通知，以常理判斷，五萬元大鈔當係一種謠傳。至謠傳所以如此之盛，則由於各地現鈔普遍短缺，而</p>
<p>現鈔短缺</p>
<p>乃受物價陡漲之影饗，以致物資與幣値之間失去平衡。此外，因隴海路受阻，現鈔調撥端賴空運，數量上不免略受限制。至本市現鈔短缺，除上述原因外，尚受西安影饗：因陜棉收購約有七十五萬擔，照市價二百萬元一據計算，共需一萬五千億元，除以其信用支付及立即流回市塲者外，最少亦需四五千億現鈔，此項鉅額現鈔突然洗人農村，遂致西安市面現鈔奇缺。</p>
<p>貼水現象</p>
<p>亦隨之發生，而貼水額萬達十分之一，故由蘭帶一億現鈔至陝，即可賺一千萬元，蘭陝問航程僅一小時，旅客一隻手提箱內，即可携帶二億元，故近來商業銀行及商人攜帶現鈔赴陝者頗多，致本市亦呈現鈔短缺。然此項行爲在法令上並無不合，故亦無從取締，惟就國際經濟立場而論，自為不健全之現象。楊氏並告記者：該行已派副理張永敬赴滬接運現鈔，在新鈔未到之前，行使市面之本票，僅有四億，且均係舊票，乃一過渡時期應念辦法。十月三十日，已由滬</p>
<p>空運到蘭現鈔三百億元，日內將　有五六百億元還米，本市籌碼，不至發生問題。貼水現象亦不致出現於本市。又此間公私銀行，因限制貸訪商業備款後，市面漸趨安定，但對日用必需品及工礦貸款，則照舊經營，故甘肅之物價，尚無再度活動之可能。（通訊員宋麟）</p>

<h3>天津　箱屍案　全部破獲</h3>
<p>〔本報天津十月卅一日航訊）津市兇殺案層出不窮，最近又發生了一件駭人聽聞的箱屍案，本報已有專電刋載。茲誌全情如次：被害的中年婦人，名　玉貞，（三十五歲，山東人，）乃曹吳舊部　政國師長的女兒，兇手即其丈夫　賽旿，現任天津中天當機　經理，（字允之，三十八歲，天津人，）　涉所及的，還有李之第二妻施美麗，（二十七歲，中德混血　，自稱是施　基的姪孫女。）案發後當即由警察局迅速破獲。</p>
<p>另結新歡　時生齟齬</p>
<p>李賽旿與董玉貞結婚已十八年，並生有兩男兩女，長女現年十二歲，最小的是個男孩，才四歲。李數年前又結識施美麗，並於三十四年八月廿日在北平美以美會也正式結了婚，黃住在天津　南道一百二十號，李與施現在則同居於天津大理道五十三號，李董之間，感情益趨惡化，時常發生齟齬</p>
<p>妹妹尋姊　丈夫登報</p>
<p>十月廿五日，　玉貞赴李施同居處找李，就此宣告失踪。她的妹妹董玉芝，（曹琨三孫媳）曾多方尋找，遍尋無踪。於是她於本月廿八日親向警察總局報案，請求查找，又於廿九日催李允之在報上登了一條尋人廣告，原文如下：「李董玉貞，年三十五歲，（係已故黃師長政國之長女，）身穿紫紅大衣，黑綢夾絨袍，米色平底女鞋，於十月二十五日下午五時由十區大理道五十三號乘案輪車外出，至今未歸，遍找無蹤，有知其下落洛者請賜信，備有重謝，決不食言。李允之謹啓。住址第十區大理道五十三號。」</p>
<p>怪柳條包　托友保管</p>
<p>廿六日晨九點鐘，津聯合汽車修理廠職員芮樂（拉脫維亞人）的太太安娜，忽然接到與她原是朋友的施美麗一封德文信，大意說有一個柳條包要暫存在安娜貯藏室裘，請代爲保管，換着便由李允之和　　麗送到一個柳條包。施美麗臨走時說：箱子裏是地毯，假如有氣味，必然是小貓大小便之故。廿八日，安娜又收到施美麗一封信，說準備把箱子帶走，要加一個木箱在外面。</p>
<p>報警查驗　撬開箱子</p>
<p>九日下午，李允之果然就拿着一隻大木箱到安娜處，自己動手把柳條包裝入木箱。商樂認爲這隻怪箱情跡可疑，於是在二十九晚以電話通知警察局派員檢查，由警察局刑事隊長蕭志純親自出馬，到達芮樂處後，將箱子撬開，結果發現是一具女屍，頭顱已被割下，並且用火燒焦，面自已不能辨認，另外兩條腿，也已被割下來，全身共被支解爲四塊，慘不忍睹。</p>
<p>一對兇犯供出實情</p>
<p>刑事隊根據芮樂所述住址，速夜將李施住宅包圍，加以逮捕，李　之終於供出屍體即係董玉珍，並且確是被他所殺。據李供：「董玉珍　五日來找我，要三條金子，一輛汽車，一顆鑽石，因而發生爭吵，當時他突然用修理汽車的鐵頭打我，後來月超越厲害，我奪過鐵頭來向她頭上蒙擊了一下，當時施美麗怕她喊呌，也跑過來按住她的腿，後來發現她已死了，乃拖入洗澡間中，防水沖洗他頭上的血及，就暫時索入洗澡間里。下午五點鐘，我們裝送她走，並且站在門口按鈴，告訴僕人：「五奶奶回去了」。</p>
<p>鋼鋸割屍</p>
<p>爐火焚頭</p>
<p>當晚，就與施美麗買柳條包等物，用鋼鋸將屍體支解，並在爐于上將頭燒爛，然後一　裝入柳條包中。次晨，就自己開汽車，送至芮樂家中」。施美麗不承認共同殺入，但是她承認參加滅除屍體的工作。</p>
<p>這案子發生迄今，黃家對於　玉真的老太太方面還是瞞著，那四個孩子們也還在等著他們的媽媽回去呢！（記者李紹林）</p>

<h3>無錫保安隊　陰謀犯　在常州就逮</h3>
<p>隊長不屈全家殉難</p>
<p>〔本報無錫三日訊〕駐防南方泉鎭之保安第三中隊第三分隊，因募補列兵缺額，爲匪徒乘機潛入，串同列兵吳俊，張濟國，沈有松等，於上月二十八日深晚一時許，突然發動陰謀，將全隊官兵二十八人刦持，迫登匪船，向太湖方面逸去，翌日除列兵楊　歧等六名粱隙逃回外，機槍手黃少華，被匪綑縛，投入湖心，事後，徐縣長一面派隊追緝，一面馳電太湖邊區各縣，協同進剿。迨至一日午後，徐縣長得悉武進翁縣長電告，謂被據之保安隊四名，已在該縣境內發現，並擊斃匪徒一名，徐縣長接電後，當派保安隊副大隊長蔡文通，於二日携文赴常，將已獲謀變匪徒吳俊，脫險士兵張六九，狄文能，及第九班現長張鳳池等迎提來錫，當晚由徐縣長親自開庭，嚴加審訊，據張鳳池等稱：當時匪軍在黑暗中，刦持全隊官兵時，均穿便衣，其中叛變隊士有沈有松，張濟國，吳俊、及新補入列兵四人，（姓名不詳，）擁入營房，將全部官兵講架，迫至湖濱，分乘二船，由匪徒嚴密監視，向湖西南駛去，中途在　子港口換船，折向宜興方面而去，並在焦山附近，匪徒以　槍掃射漁船，船上搖船老婦中彈受傷，旋又遇山芋船一艘，確得衣物甚　，船至小梅山，匪等見機槍手黃少華態度倔强，即聲稱：「今天你死期到了」，黃　書：毫不畏懼，答稱：「大丈夫誓死如歸，沒有關係」，一匪舉命黃立於船員，以　餛飩一只，推入湖中慘死，匪等又因保安分隊長呂榮光，忠貞不屈，亦如法泡製，投入湖中，並將其要及二子，當塲處死。船至宜興縣境分水墩伯　口登津，擬與潛伏武宜邊區之匪軍連絡，匪等遂持槍押同被刦官兵，漏夜理路，連越二個山頭，即在武進境內潘家橋上高村潛伏，更換便服，在甲長家秘密會議，討論去向問題，後即強迫各士兵與彼等焚香祝告，並結拜金蘭兄弟，表示團結，當時謀變匪徒沈有松稱：「我們結拜之後，彼此一心，有福同事，有難同當，」然後將一部槍枝彈藥，分別埋藏地下，匪等率同一部份士兵，匆匆而去。向無錫，宜興，溧陽等處連絡匪部，僅留程姓一匪，特步槍一支，看守張班長等三人，程匪忽擬往村上購買香烟，因衣服襤褸，恐受人注目，故向隊士張六九偕褲　着，正在掉換問，張班長見有機可乘，突將匪槍奪下，連關二槍，將程匪擊斃，始得奔至　家橋鎭，報告該鎭自衛隊，前往搜索，旋在分水墩山頭草　，逮獲謀變匪吳後一名，並起獲步槍十枝，刺刀二十餘柄，機槍一艇，子彈數百發，後由該隊解往武這縣府訊押云云。徐縣長據供後，以張班長等勇敢可嘉，賞給變金十萬元，隊士張六九，狄文龍二人，各賞五萬元，論飭返　服務，嗣又提訊謀變匪吳　，則對各種陰謀，矢口否認，並狡　謂事變之當晚，渠適出外小便，爲匪所刦持，並未參加叛變，徐縣長以一時無法使其吐露傎情，　令釘鐐收押，聽候核辦。</p>
<h3>武進一怪案　趙文英　遭暗殺　兩子冒名携械捕人</h3>
<p>〔木報武進三日訊〕北鄉龍虎塘東南里許趙家村鄉民趙文英，年六十歲，曾任鄉長十餘年，突於九月十四日被匪徒綁架，於翌日晨發覺被勒斃於田野，死狀極慘。當時一般揣測，或爲已被槍決之著匪周煥章之弟煥淸之報復行爲。</p>
<p>趙文英有子永耀，竹耀，永耀在　靑年團任幹事，竹耀從軍在外，悉父　，返里料理，幷偵得顧壽林，湯大生等有嫌疑，先後會同刑警隊逮捕下獄，又往崑山拘捕張持甫。上月下旬永耀，竹耀又往蘇州拘捕張持甫之子張瑞金，一併下獄，由縣府軍法科審訊。軍法科對是案，久懸不決，張持甫家族，易請法院提審，亦未獲准。在張持　方面傳出消息：本年趙永　在鄉精選縣參議員，時張持甫爲保代表，僅以張一票之差而告落選，銜恨切骨，以是借題發揮云云，地方各機關公國，爲爲雙方結怨殊灤，內幕不易斷定，祗得靜待公判。二區專員公署，近赤接到是案情報，特令飭縣府愼重審理。最近蘇州城防指揮部，在上月三十日據當地保甲長陳炳奎，黃兆槐報告稱：「張瑞金，武進人，今年來此工作，（按係製　），無越規行動，至十月二十一日下午二時，被匪三人，並無公文，私帶槍械，冒充奉蘇州城防指揮部命令來此，從樓上用短槍捉去，經調查，係趙永　，竹　和一奸匪所為，並且私刑拷打，類似綁票，現解常州縣府，既不審問，又不解司法辦理，望把此匪捉拿」等語，蘇城防部據報，當電　城防部，並派兩情報員來常，向　局要求將在押之張瑞金提蘇偵訊，同時，請常州城防指揮派員協助捕提冒用該部名義妨害治安之趙永耀，竹耀歸案法辦。城防部當於日下午准派士兵，會同所轄警局，暨保甲長，按址去中右鎭十保六甲六戶，將竹耀當塲捕獲，永耀外出未獲，並在房內抄出電話總機一隻，掛機一隻，聽筒一個，手提機槍一支，快機彈夾一個，子彈十發，手槍皮套一個，美式左輪槍一支，子彈九發，卡平槍子彈五十五發。去員即將抄出軍火，暫置諜報處。趙竹　押城防部，將繼續逮捕永耀，定即日一併解蘇。靑年圖書記尹祖烈聞訊，出事至晚，走訪城防之魂部李督察長，竭力保證被捕之趙竹耀爲良民，並稱爲團員，所藏之槍械，則指爲常州靑年分團寄存。該督察長當表示，此事須請示蘇州城防部，迄發稿時止，此事尚未獲回背。</p>

<h3>平衡會鼓勵出口吸收僑匯　外匯市價新調整</h3>
<p>商品及金融市場情形均甚穩定</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕外匯平衡基金委員會，昨晨公佈新調整之外匯價格。美匯五萬九千五百元，原價五萬五千元，升四千五百元；英匯十八萬七千元，原價十七萬二千元，計升一萬五千元；印　一萬四千元六角五分，原價一萬二千八百七十七元零一分，計升一千一百二十三元六角四分；港匯一萬一千六百三十八元八角，原價一萬零七百零五元二角一分，計升九百三十三元五角九分。</p>
<p>指定銀行手續費，經會商決定，美匯由七百元，增至八百元，英匯由二千元，增爲二千五百元，港匯比之手續費爲一千二百元。過去各指定銀行，多以其業務上之需要，而有差別，大致均不能收足。</p>
<p>據外匯平衡基金委員會方面透露，此次外匯之調整，乃適合需要，並參考國際形而加決定者。同時爲鼓勵出口並吸收僑匯起見，調整外匯，亦屬需要。對於一般物價，並無直接影饗。昨日金融及商品市塲，皆未因外匯調整而有所波動，且皆呈下跌之勢。其原因爲　銀根日趨緊縮，　國行與財部繼續會同抽查栗據交換所退　傎相，　美國貸款有望，因此金融情形頗穩定。</p>
<p>又外匯平衡基金委員會沈熙端昨接見記者談稱：近來出口美確又告呆滯，如桐涌及猪　，其價格較過去之外匯市價相差百分之十。目前又達出口季節，故此次調整，純爲鼓勵出口，至外匯收支方面，迄目前止，已能達到平衡階段。</p>
<h3>銀根緊賣氣盛　華股普遍下降</h3>
<p>華股昨仍屬疲檔，小型熱股亦退入新股上市價內。爲調查退票而引起銀根大緊，了結及翻空者衆，雖有逢低收購，無濟於事。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>僅中國水泥因廠房吸納，高掛漲停，餘均見低。永紗二七八元及二八一元開後，即愈售愈低。美匯牌價掛高，始被拉上，又以脫手者多，銀根又緊，塲外息價開一角九分半及二角四，步降至二七一元及二七四元。永公新股遲至十一時一刻，始以一四○元之價開盤。離原價過高，開後即告跌停。近午永紗退至即交二六六元，　交二六八元半低價。午收爲二七元及二七○元。內衣五和慘跌最多，熱股亦普遍帶小，僅水泥獨站高檔，冷股尚平而已。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>即交退至二六九元，　交二七○元，幸逢低有納，國行交換，略有差出，回漲到即交二七三元，遞交二七五元。此後又被拋低，惟未破入入二七○元內，以二七二元及二七四元之價務市。塲外各老股計銀行股仍穩，文化股及舊證交再挺。</p>
<h3>統債外股齊跌</h3>
<p>公債昨仍無精神，雖有三六○室五五二室及某洋行來納，五五五室五○三室之供給較多。統丙目晨開二○○○○元後，微升爲二○三○○元，低價達一八○○○元，最後回上至一九三○○元結束。較前收計甲乙挫五百元，丙降四百元，丁戊各跌一千元，成交仍僅四百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨洋行帮證券帮有供，錢兌業及散戶有買。港申電微升，熱股在盤旋中稍疲。怡紗晨開一八六○○○元，低價一八一○○○元，最後在一八四○○○左右掙扎。較前收計墾植稍升，祥泰電話各降一成左右，餘股概形微降。</p>
<h3>食米先漲後回　粳秈上落不多</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬四千八百餘石，市况先漲後回，結果粳秈米均少上落。白陰元亦少波動。麵粉到源仍湧，廠方繼續供應，人心虛軟，回挫二三千元。麩皮胃呆，下跌一二千元。豆餅客銷不動，再低二三千元。黃豆油廠及客帮進胃均懈，到源綫</p>
<p>蒃豆靑島略進，暫成堅挺之格。蠶豆零化甚懈，綾疲三五千元。赤豆廣方停辦，猛落三五萬兀。紅糧北方續動，價形挺站。苞米北洋有動，提高殺低。生仁到銷兩接，亦無呼吸。芝蔴最爲呆滯，不跌二三萬元。</p>
<p>油市漢口大批湧到，人心不漲，豆油績跌三五萬元，蔴油跌五六萬元，淸油平正，菜油堅定。</p>
<h3>行總原棉廿萬包　即日起開始撥發</h3>
<p>行總美棉二十萬包，分類工作業已完竣，登記易紗廠家，計台灣，廣東，天津，上海等四區，共八十四家。又六區紡織會所屬，小廠五十八家，其分配辦法，係按照紡調會暨外棉核配會所訂辦法平均分配，業定五日起開始撥交原棉。於兩星期內辦竣，規定限二十五天至七十天內交紗。聞上項原棉，總計可易紗十六萬件。</p>
<h3>中信局擬另組機構　收購自備外匯物資</h3>
<p>收購自備外匯到埠物資，中信局負資人曾作非正式之討論，決定另行組織機構，負責辦理，名稱暫定爲中央信託局處理自備外匯到埠物資審議委員會。將來是否有所修正，待該機構正式組織時，再行決定。爲便執行起見，委員會之下，分組辦事，亦暫定總務。財務。儲運。收購。處理等五組。中央銀行，海關，輸管會等有關機關，均被邀拿加。至實施細則內所訂各項辦法，該局認爲執行時困難甚多，將另有意見簽請核示。</p>
<h3>印度棉花進口　先定臨時辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊」紡織品外銷委員會昨日開會決定對紗布掉印棉事，申請各廠在其產量未報核前，先定臨時辦法，准印棉先行進口，俟各廠產量核定後，再規定各該承換廠出口紗布數量，現申請訂約之紗廠已逾三十家，大約可進口印棉五萬包。</p>
<h3>行局差出　銀根仍緊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀根仍緊，暗息一角九分，華股多空貼息二角四分。　行差出二二七億元，四行兩局差出三五億元，大交換行莊差入一一八億元，小交換差出二八三億元，外商銀行差入二〇○億元，中國銀行昨糖欶五百餘億結賬，差入七二二億元，交通差出三九七億元，中農差出二億元，中信局差人一一七億元，郵政匪業局差出三六億元，合作金庫差出二○二億元。</p>
<h3>中農秋繭貸款　未達預定目標</h3>
<p>中國農民銀行舉辦之秋雨貸款，巳屆結束。截至目前止，江浙兩省貸出總額爲一四八億餘，目前兩省收兩數量，共僅一○。四六六担，包括江蘇六，七二二担，浙江三，七四四担，比之預定目標，相去過遠。若以四六○　折之標準計算，則所收秋　僅共得生絲六○担左右，據當業者估計，本年秋兩雖以秋陽暴烈，桑葉水份减少，桑蝗活躍，及當時米價上漲，當農以不敷政府規定之每但一○八萬元成本種種原因，致將一部份鮮　出售於自備資金之廠商，其數亦約達一萬五千擔，是則政府收購數量雖不能　預定目標，然　農獲得資金，亦與活潑農村經濟有一利云。</p>
<h3>繼續徹查退票　市面現鈔軋缺</h3>
<p>取締辦法俟呈准實施</p>
<p>取締退票辦法，已由國行稽核處草擬完竣，一俟呈准，即可實施。該處對票據交換所撿查退票工作，仍繼續會同財部派員嚴格執行。上週六抽查結果，經詳加分析，按所舉退票原因，向各行莊逐一查對，以便報部核示辦法，預料短期內即可公佈。又悉，關於當日支票不能抵用一節，現仍嚴格辦理。</p>
<p>又訊：各行莊經常局嚴格管理後，退票數量及金額已逐漸减少，平均每日約减二百億元。各市塲對支票交易，咸具戒心，一部份股實商號，皆以現鈔交易，故市上銀根益形緊倘，現鈔籌碼甚缺，並有發生貼水情事，據傳每億現鈔須貼水一百四十餘萬元云</p>
<h3>絲綢市況疲弱</h3>
<p>人造絲漸趨平定，昨市行情與　　　　　　　　　　光一A上午做七千五百萬元，一度喊過六百萬元，下午爲五百五十萬元，賣出價喊六百萬元。三A貨昨做七千萬尤，四A貨吸收有人，價比上日抬高三百萬元，做六千一百萬元。</p>
<p>廠絲昨市略呈疲軟，交易極淡。各級五担頭喊價俱比上日小一百萬元，零担成交價比上日小五十萬元，高零担昨做七天期款價六千二百五十萬元，干經喊備穩</p>
<p>昨市價　　面行情　　，大誠與　强貨閒市即降至二千三百萬元，有六七張成交。一度出三百萬元關外，卒在一片　　中，節節下挫，降至隔日期六十二萬元，後又面高至七十餘萬元，迄收市時終仍底降至明斯四十萬元，隔日期五十五萬元，結果比上日短一百三十萬元弱，美亞貨比文　憤天十五萬元，　錦縐高　貨　五萬二千元，其他傎絲貨如　緞等，均極疲軟。</p>
<h3>買戶袖手不動　棉紗布繼續下跌</h3>
<p>藍鳳紗比上日軋降百卅餘萬</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因當局澈查退票，商人對開出支票，轉趨鄭重，致銀根異當緊迫，市上斬吐仍多，買戶袖手，行情續告狂瀉。嗣有見低收吸，價稍回堅，但結果四二支藍鳳細紗低至三千二百卅萬元，比上日仍軋跌一百卅三萬。其他各支粗細紗，市盤亦步降七八十萬至百萬之　。</p>
<p>棉布市况，美匯掛牌雖提高，行情無甚刺激，蓋因退票　未淸楚，銀根步緊，斬多頻起，是以十二秘龍頭等各檔細布，收價比上日繼降自八千至二萬三四千元。一九○高檔士林，因染廠供售不多，價仍堅挺。跳鰻漂布業中人套買，獨好五千，其他嗶嘰直黃色布等，一致不振。</p>
<p>現棉盤旋</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况，再趨疲歡，紗廠同業銀根均緊，納胃鬆　，交易清淡，價各稍軟。惟因產地市價高於上海，貨主亦不顧輕脫，故價格欲小不能，趨勢　旋，成交七百包，送　價做開漢細（現款）三一六萬，掉換棉紗價三四七萬，沙市三七六萬，成交三○○包，綫交價做開漢細三三二萬三千，東　二七○包，老河口三三二萬，火機二五○萬，成交四○○包，周浦籽花六二萬三千。</p>

<h3>淮南煤礦的新生　每日平均產量二千五百噸</h3>
<p>華中的寳庫</p>
<p>在長江以北，淮河以南，平漢津浦兩綫之間，一片廣闊的原野裏，埋藏着一個豐富的賓庫，這就是目下業中產量最多的淮南煤礦，—宋子文氏最近在四中全會，捐　其建設銀公司全部投資中的一個主要部門，—這個富足的煤田橫跨着皖中鳳台，懷遠，壽縣，三個縣區，佔有一千七百萬公畝的面積，地下埋藏着一萬萬公噸的黑金—煤—，假如每年出產一百八十萬噸，這個實況的開採壽命，將有四十年之久。</p>
<p>在這片廣闊的皖中平原里，除掉這塊閃光的寳石，還伸展着一條八十八公里半的還輸動脈，每天平均有一千五百噸的黑金，莊運到　埠，再京津浦路轉運到浦口，將這實況的禮物賜賞給京滬沿綫的各大工業城市。這供給光和熟的源泉，將從淮南煤田的增產計劃裘，不斷地像潮水般湧出來，流注到各地。</p>
<p>新興的生產率</p>
<p>淮南煤礦目下的生產單位，共有三個礦塲。第一礦塲就是戰前的大通煤礦，是一支產量最多，實力濃厚的老幹部。第二，第三礦塲，耶老淮南的一對孳生子東西兩煤井。這三個生產部隊的總產量，每日平均有二千五百噸，經過數十年的開挖，地下一百到一八十公尺間的藏煤已逐漸挖空，現在該礦正在開關新戰塲，開　二四○到三三○公尺的新井三座，作爲生產的後備生力軍。</p>
<p>開擊新井，在採礦工程中是一樁艱巨偉大的工程，從地面開始通過地層一千多尺，而積六公尺直徑，這樣一個大的井洞，開挖後還妥用時製的井石和水泥，從頭到尾砌起來，然後再通下排水的鐵管和行車的鋼軌，將來地下的「黑金」就一車車地裝在一頂像轎子似的煤籠裏，用電絞車吊出來，這和上海國際飯店開電梯的情景相仿。</p>
<p>當記者到井邊去參觀時，從洞口望下去，只見一個張着大口漆黑的無底陷井，從井底傳出來一聲聲金屬的撞擊聲，大桶的泥石從井底吊出來，工人就坐在這桶裏從井口吞下去。這樣一個浩大神奇的工程，不知化費多少人工和財力！</p>
<p>第一礦的三號井，經一年來的辛勤，井身已經完成，現在正在地面趕築鋼筋混凝土的井樓和井架，並按裝向「行　」購來的一部一千匹馬力的電絞事，估計這支新軍明年初就可以入伍應戰。每日升吐三千噸「黑金」，其威力將超過所有的老幹部。此外七號井和第二礦新三號井兩支新軍，也在加緊開　，預計明後年可相　完成，牠們的產量也都有二，三千噸一天。這羣年靑力壯的新興後備軍，將給淮南煤礦增加新的生機，整個華中工業區也可獲得更充沛的燃料。</p>
<p>一顆新的寳石</p>
<p>在距離老鑛區廿五公里的西北角，風台縣境的八公山下，最近發現了一顆新的寶石，淮南煤鑛局和資源委員會的地質探勘隊，在那英作了半年多的探測工作。用大小不等的鐵管鑽進地下數百公尺，在不同的地位，打了十四個鑽孔，格於證實在展延七公里半的地面下，埋藏有十九　煤，共計卅公又厚，四萬莫公噸的「黑金儲量。假如每天開挖一萬噸，這　賽石的光輝將閃耀百年之久。</p>
<p>這個新煤田，不僅藏量富足，煤質良佳，並且地質構造也非常便於開採，煤層的傾斜度（160）非常平緩，並且接近地面，經　全體工程人員詳細的硏究和討論以後，決定從地面開斜井來採煤，並準備運用各種新式的採煤機械。如在幷下裝價皮帶運煤，代替　馬的拖拉，和人力的扛抬，用割煤的機器代替于的挖掘，這種機械化的採媒方法，在英美各國早就運用，效力旣高，產量又大，鑛工的死傷和勞役，也可大大减輕。沒有親自下過井的人，決難想像井下鑛工的生活是如何艱辛。</p>
<p>八公山新礦的開採計劃，已經開始實行，前後分為三期。每期各開　二二○公尺長的斜井一對，作爲運煤的孔道，將來裝上　煤皮帶大堆的「黑金」，就躺在道皮床上自動的滾出來。道些新的機械，已經向國外去訂購，假如能够如期運到，這個新寶庫，每天將吐掛二千六百噸「黑金子」，後年可增加到六千噸。這個先天壯健的新生兒，將給准南煤鑛奠下遠大的前程，在皖中原野裏大放光明。（淮南特約記者王其）</p>

<h3>圖畫館橋</h3>
<p>— 洪爲法</p>
<p>揚州續夢之廿四</p>
<p>故鄉的兒時嬉遊之地，年事旣長，偶一經過，必多回憶，有時爲了免生感喟，也會經越改道。譬如吾揚之圖　館橋，雖是往來新舊城問的孔道，而筆者便不甚願意從那裏經過橋以圖書館名，自是因漆貼近圖書館之故，可是如今橋之附近，並無圖書館，這在中年人尙能知其舊址所在，而靑年人則在其記憶的領械中，便難於覓得絲雜印象了。</p>
<p>橋直對現時的五區專員公署，現時專署便是戰前敎育局，敎育局以前便勸學所，勸學所以前便是圖書館了。湯寅臣滸北光生著的「廣陵私乘」上稅；「蔣一雙，字紹第，原名彭齡，甘泉歲貢生。少年時不自檢束好狎邪遊，幾不能自保其鼻。然其爲人好新學，勇於任事。方其爲縣視學時，創辦華瀛公社謀立地方高等小學堂，建設公國，築關書館，並築橋以通行人，雖經費不必盡由己出，然能於晦盲否塞之際，力謀公益，以冀開通，不可謂非一時之人傑業。」陳懋森賜卿主編的「江都縣新志」上也說他「光緒戊戌剏匡時學會於揚州，與康有爲梁啓超遙通聲氣。迄康梁勢敗，學會雖停，而興學之志不少衰，揚州府中學及江甘小學，管其提倡。平生以開通民智爲已任，組設華瀛公社，獲確中西圖書，任人購閱，　輸新智識於民衆，學者深資其益。又設私塾改良曾，無政　習所，江甘自治分所，建築圖書館於舊城之墟，並醵資建築公園，閲在圖書館南，成績斐然，資望益著，因充任甘泉勸學所所長，得遂提倡敎育之夙願。」於此可知如今的圖書館橋，乃因過去貼近關屬館而得名，而此橋與圖書館公園等等均蔣光生所創修。在蔣創修此橋及圖書館公園等等以及充任視學所長時，頗受邑人之攻許。如某名士所寫「揚州十古怪小曲，」其五首即以蔣爲攻訐對象。如說：「五古怪，傎古怪，關鼻居然登學界！兩年視學善鑽營，十載　堂尤厲害，把持公益技偏多，勾結官塲才不壞。」又說：「府中高等總監工，洋錢賺了三千塊；樓房高砌到城頭，陳設圖書做買賣。」此等冷嘲熱駡，幾使當事者無地自容。可是筆者每過圖館橋，兒時舊事，固忿集　海，而對於蔣先生之所作爲，仍多欽敬之處，因爲悠今懷舊，他總還爲地方做了若干公益之事，也類有一些表現，似不匯僅是一個冷嘲熱駡的對象。</p>
<p>說　兒時舊事，圖書館舊址，直至改爲最近之專員公署，其問使筆看感到飛大不同的，乃是進出之人隨着時間而愈變愈少。因爲圖書館時代，可以任人進出，勸學所及敎育局時代，進出者便有限制，到了專署時代，則更有限制。不過勸學所及敎育局時代，在房屋後而還有一座高　的土丘，這是舊城城垣拆除後的遺跡，也就是新志上所說的「舊城之墟」，兒時常臺和小友上去看看，可以約略得見勸學所或敎有局的屋字之佈署，以及人員之動態。從來土丘被局裏用竹離圖　進去，便無法再能上去，但是每經其地，必見土丘，雖念念於舊事，却還慰情良勝無，不意時至今日，土丘又復夾平，都已變成屋宇，於是經過時，却又懷念罷失去的土丘了！</p>
<p>在新志上說到蔣先生會「醺資建築公園，園在圖書館南」實祇相去咫尺。當公園初落成時，記得還略具亭台之勝，可供遊覺，雖因其中茶社太多，被人識爲「公園茶社」，可是那時內城河還能勉强行駛遊船，遊人可以由貼近圖書館橋的公園碼頭上船，從西水關出城遊瘦西湖。當遊船在內城河行走，穿過一道道橋洞時，兩岸綠陰掩映，沿河人家多有凭窗目送者，常會令人念及杜牧之詩：「春風十里揚州路，捲上珠　總不如」。及至薄暮返城，穿過一道道僑澗時，月光照水，水波蕩樣着樹影，人影以及舟影，又常會令人念及杜牧之詩：「二十四橋明月夜，玉人何處敎吹瀟」。現在圖書館橋雖還存在，公圖碼頭却早經沒有，而公園的大部份巳爲稅捐處所佔用，剩下極小部份，據說還是茶社，但是殘破得可憐，又冷落得可憐。此外所謂內城河，也變成了小溝，兩岸爲垃圾所獨佔，無復綠陰掩映。固然西水關爲了防務關係，一時堵塞，即使依舊開放，遊船又如何再能進入呢？——這　都是因圖書館橋想到的舊事，筆者爲了怕增加腦海裏回憶的負擔，　越改道，不願從那裏理過，實亦情非得已！</p>
<h3>訴說</h3>
<p>— 靑果</p>
<p>星—說給愛星的孩子們</p>
<p>要我說我的記憶嗎？我的記憶是寂寞而明亮的。</p>
<p>孩子，你們都是多會做夢的呀。你們的夢生一雙透明的翔膀，係晚，飛向高朗的藍天。</p>
<p>而我，曾經就用星星，將馱於翅膀上的金光閃爍的日子，一個個地釘在高期的藍天上。</p>
<p>然而，天空的氣流逐漸薄弱，季節的風雨逐漸狂暴，我受傷的翔膀雖然吃力地負起艱苦的生活和厚重的希望，但也無法飛翔。我常從惡夢的邊沿跌落下來，讓急劇的心跳數着不眠在的沉重的步子。</p>
<p>守着靜夜，我不時抬頭去看那密麻的星星，釘着我寂寞而明亮的記憶的星星。</p>
<p>在那又紅又大的幾顆星星下面，就是我的故鄉。十年前，老組母指着它們說給我許多美麗的故事。而我在夢中便變成了故事裏的人物，快活地像游泳於無邊的海一樣，我行走在藍大的星的花園。</p>
<p>於是，我有着喜歡寂寞的心，喜歡寂寞的夜的靈魂。</p>
<p>一大堆金光閃爍的童年的日子是一個個地用星星釘在藍天上了。</p>
<p>孩子，你們有着水汪汪的限睛的孩十啊，不要儘是催問我的記憶吧！當你們解開夢的翅膀，划向運一片海也似的，寫着無數隻故事的監天時，你們續懂了一些什麼呢？是不是，星星也是寂寞而明亮的？</p>
<p>而如今，夜已深了，可以做夢的時間不會再省多長；星星隕落的時候到了；我們該愉快地拋掉記憶。不是麼：</p>
<p>一……我想着</p>
<p>隕落在夜寒的</p>
<p>不是已毀的生命</p>
<p>面是光明的種子啊」</p>
<p>——秒：一種子一</p>
<p>那麼，讓我們談明天吧，談未來的生活吧。</p>
<p>雨</p>
<p>是愛雨的。</p>
<p>紀得是小孩子的時候，我非常喜歡祖父的那柄黑洋布傘，有時也情地玩弄兩位叔叔和兩位孃孃的紅花紙傘。每夜，那幾張傘都好好地擺在我的夢中，我撑起它們來跑過田野，跑過草塲，跑過街道，向一羣又一羣的小朋友那裏，我取得了許多羨幕和尊敬的眼光。</p>
<p>然而，畢竟是夢，失望就緊緊地抓着我醒後的一顆心。</p>
<p>大人們說：孩子不能在天晴時撑傘，撑了會不長，會成矮子。於是我就被這種恐怖牢牢地束縛着。</p>
<p>罷是念着雨天，在雨天，可以沒有顧忌地撑起傘來。而雨可不常常下，日子差不多都是平平淡淡地走過了我的童年。</p>
<p>直到今天，我纔邁步在滿織着雨絲的原塲上。</p>
<p>但我仍舊是個孩子，我始終拿不到一把傘。祖父的黑洋布傘早在他死以前就毀滅了，叔叔嬤孃們的紅紅紙傘也不知扔向哪裏丟了。</p>
<p>現在是多雨的季節，多雨的社會，我想起我的生命將要怎樣地拖泥帶水地去掙扎！</p>
<p>我不想做夢，我知道夢不能够縫補我的希望；我不需要傘，我害怕傘要切斷我和雨的親貼。</p>
<p>我寗願永遠做着孩子，用全個傎誠的純潔的愛獻給我們人類的雨。</p>
<p>雨在潤點着日子，潤點着土地；</p>
<p>雨在潤點着我的心。</p>
<p>雨在潤點着我的心。雨在一顆類地打着我荒凉了的乾涸了的心啊！</p>
<p>在雨天，我要去走泥濘的路。讓頭上的雨和足下的泥衆在我的身上趙出一朶二朶千英銀亮的雨的花，金黃的泥的花。</p>
<p>然後，我含差笑，我歡快地吹起口哨，挨次地去敲開那一圖，閉着的窗子。</p>
<p>醉　給憂籲的人</p>
<p>你最怕的是不是思想？思想是一條曲折鐵深的溪流。隨着這溪流，你可以常常發見飄浮在水面上的許多朶薔微，那就是過去的歡樂和希望，受了摧毀，遺下來的殘花。傎的，過去是一朶兩朶地在夢與影的風雨中墜落了。</p>
<p>沒有辦法，只有將自己的痛楚揀起來又鄒開去。然而，不瞞你說，我早已增見憂傷跟在你的後面，他向你獰笑，用兩只灰黑的眼睛死盯着你。</p>
<p>你曾經收藏在枕囊裏的好夢呢？破碎了吧？那該怪你壓着它的頭太沉重了，誰叫你要裝那麼多的思想在腦袋裏？</p>
<p>問問你，你的聽覺還健全嗎？關不着的哀愁，很着一種低微而又顫抖的音浪，流洩在迷茫的空間，又跌落在靈魂的土上，你聽見的吧？你的心谷間，有沒有發生過回響？</p>
<p>好，今天是你的生辰，請原諒我，我瑣絮地向你嘮叨了一些使你不安的話；現在，還裏有一杯苦酒，你喝了它，我祝福你！不要害怕，不要躊躇，舉起來，那僅是一杯溶和着人生滋味的苦酒；沒有毒，自然也沒有什麼芬香和甜實。</p>
<p>快些吧！我又催促第二遍了啊！你開腔了，聲音爲什麼那樣小呢？</p>
<p>——我辦了！我醉了！我早就醉了！</p>
<p>你醉了？這是多麼有意思的一句話啊！它像游絲地，牽引到冷淡無際的夜裏去了。</p>
<p>那麼，睡下來吧！</p>
<p>是的，你傎醉了，你傎早就醉了。</p>
<p>好好地睡下來！讓靜靜的窗子看着你，讓紅紅的燈光搖着你</p>
<p>讓慈祥的秋雨輕輕地唱一只催眼曲給你。</p>
<p>等到明天拂曉，我們一道爬上山嶺去看那新生的太陽。</p>

<h3>沙爾德講存在主義</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>存在主義（Existentialism）是一世紀以前丹麥的哲學家基克加德（Kierkegoard）所提出的，他反對基督敎所說的我們都是上帝的罪人。這位細長腿的人準備着他的理論，不顧同時代人的反對，戰學的罪縣使得他的哲學成爲歐洲的中心思想。他的學說與美愛瑪生的「自信」（Self－Reliance）結合起來。</p>
<p>不過，不管沙爾德（JeanPaluSartre）怎樣想避免人們的詛咒，他那存在主義究竟是一種失望的哲學。他自己的戲劇也充滿了失望和狂暴的人物，他們時常爲奮鬥失敗而焦隊，斷百他們的無人救助。這演講「存在主義」是一九四五年在巴黎講的，今年纔譯成英文。沙爾德說他的哲學傎的是「自信」的實庫，但他創作中的人物却不能證實他所說的話。他介紹了基克加德對於「有限」的戰慄，在可怕的「無限」的神前，這是「一種人人可以感覺得到的焦慮。」沙爾德說，這就是人的世界，沒有人能替他設法。在這神秘的海裏淹着游泳者，他們痛苦地把手臂伸出水面，高聲呼救，結果是一塲空。</p>
<p>沙爾德相信與「人所不可見的力量」對抗，一定要在「有限的」人類自己的主觀裏。他可覺得工業社會把他變成沒有竟義的東西麽？他是否無助地在黑暗裏摸索呢？沙爾德說：很好，我的好人，解放你自己吧。這是很容易的。「人沒有什麼，他是自己做出來的。你可以自由，選擇，那就是創造。」</p>
<p>沙爾德不是圖書館裏的哲學家，他曾見過巴黎地下室最下層的生活。他的生命是動的，不是靜比的。他認爲「傎實」不容易被理解，除非與「心」或「個人的存在經驗」結合在一起。人是熱情而且耐苦的東西，不是純理性的非人性的工具。他不發展到基督敎存在主義，却寗顧留在人問，這就是他與基克加籠不同之處。</p>
<p>「我想，沒有「人」的「傎實」可以除去；因此，我存在。」沙爾德的演講是一種勇敢的嘗試，想重建人的自由與尊貴，並不要僑賴上帝。</p>
<p>以上節目星期六文學評論巴里斯（OlivrBarres）的評語。巴里斯是雅禮神學院的學生。</p>
<p>爲補充起見，我再介紹「哥倫比亞近代歐洲文學辭典」上對於存在主義的解釋以作補充。「「傎實」除了是爲「心」的，便成爲無意義，這就是出發點。存在主義者說，這並不是說，像理想主義那樣，一切「傎實」都在「心」裏。「外面的世界」仍舊是存在的。事實上，「人類的傎實」是一種離心力，無休止地引導到物質東西上去。不要失去自信，要成爲完整的個性。照沙爾德說，按照邏輯，這是矛盾的。因此，人類的存在必至於缺乏，虛空與失敗。就因爲這種不完全，我們能够自由，我們自由的本身是虛無的。」</p>
<p>大約沙爾德想要「人定勝天」，努力掙扎，結果仍逃不出「死」的一關，「有限」終於屈服於「無限」，於是結果他仍只有失尃</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「那也好。」我點頭承認他的主張：「可是我記得您剛才說過，您和南口方而的我軍前錢，通過了消息；又說今天晚上的夜襲，由您和虎城親自上前綫左翼，利用機關槍，發送信號。我有些疑慮——您想這件事可能辦得到嗎？」</p>
<p>「這兩個問題，我可以分開來答覆您；「耀羣文起蹙了那一　一改造過了的　峯：「一，關於我們這邊跟南口的守軍聯絡的事，那是事實；回頭我可以讓虛弟把道些事、都報告給　聽。第二點，用機關槍當信　的話，昨天晚上我們已經實驗過了，也收到寗方的答覆：方式就是『三二……三二……連放……』……」</p>
<p>「慢着，據我所知道的，日本軍隊，軍令異常的嚴明；幾乎可以說，每一個步兵放一粒子彈，都應該有命令上的根據。我的意思是說，不知道您如何能够跑到日軍的流綫去？這是一點。第二點，就說能够通過許多的關口，到了前綫，假定沒有任何人的命令，您用什麼方　去使用機關槍？也許……」</p>
<p>「我明瞭了您的意思。」耀羣接口答覆着：「這一層，我只要說明一點。您就可以明白了。您大概還沒有知道，我在這一帶串演的一個什麼角色。假使您知道我是敵寇當中一個老資格間的羣助手，這一切您大概也都可以明瞭了。」</p>
<p>我聽到這裹，不覺似有所悟：「這個老資格的問諜，大概就是買沙夫！不過…………」</p>
<p>「不過他有什麼能力，可以在日本軍隊的前綫上權衝直蘭，是不是？」耀羣替我把疑問說明出來；接着「嗤」地一笑；我告訴您，他是否胡說八道，我不敢說；不過事實上，證明了他有一種特殊的權力，可以在日軍當中，隨便來往；不僅是他個人可以這麼辦，他還可以帶着我回處第，在日軍的前綫上，鑽來鑽去，毫無問題……」</p>
<p>「那麼？……」我想問耀羣關於任意放槍的事。</p>
<p>「您請聽！」耀羣不讓我挿口；「她的作風，有些那麼瘋瘋癲癲頭似的……我親眼睛看見他在前綫上，把一個小鬼頭目的手槍，接了過來，「啪啪啪」隨便這麼放了三槍：然後把槍扔還給那個小頭目，點了一點頭說：「很好！」說着，就此走開。這倒不算希奇。最奇怪的，是那個日本小鬼，接到了她扔還的乎槍，滿口的「多謝」之外，還帶一鞠躬……」</p>
<p>「哼，奇怪！」我實在感覺希奇。因爲據我知道，日本軍隊常中，向來沒有這個例規。像買沙夫這種行爲，這樣的放肆胡來，似乎連日本的高級長官，都　不到。要是在戰綫以外，也許還有半分的可能。</p>
<p>「我也感覺得莫明其妙。」耀羣說着，神色上也現出一種狐疑的態度；好像是在追想什麼經過似的：「然而這一切，都是事實。所以說，今天晚上，由買沙夫這傢伙，領着我們上日本前綫，用機關槍遞送消息的話，是完全可以相信的……」</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>要管閒事</h3>
<p>— 朱梅</p>
<p>民爾二十一年的夏天，我在法國靈都鐵里（ChateaurThiery）過假期。靈都嫩里是馬萊河流域的一個城，由於水流太激，他們在城後用人工　了一條運河，以分散水力。這條運河的水很淸，魚也很多，而且都是大魚，我本來平常喜歡釣魚，所以買了一根漁竿去釣，剛好把漁綫拋下水，對岸就有一個人出來干涉我，他說這地方不准釣魚。我一細看是一個正在耕地的農昆，當時我有一點奇怪，河是公家的，爲何不准釣魚？我就問他什麼理由，他說有法令，不許可，我聽後馬上收拾漁竿掃興而返。晚上我問房東，運河不准釣魚的理由，他說這是靈都城頒佈的法令，同時他又告訴我在這兒釣魚有一個釣魚會，打烏有一個打島會，釣魚也有指定的地方也有一定的時間（上午太陽起來前下午太陽落山後不准）打鳥也是一樣，有時節，有指定的塲所，不可隨便去打的，這印象和談話至今使我不忘，其理由有二：第一，外國人好管閒事，與咱們中國人的想法兩樣。中國人是凡事與己無干者絕不過問，純粹個人主義的，最高的理想是把自己弄好，旁人好也好，壞也好，與他無關，而西洋人呢，你好，他就傎拍掌，你壞，他就反對，所以我們的國家，儘管法律森嚴，警察衆多，做壞事的照樣做壞事，並不是說外國就沒有做壤事的，而是他們並不以爲有了警察萬事不管，而是凡是一件事祗要看見不合理馬上就要干涉，好像那個農夫，他即不是警察，又不是法官，但他是一個好國民，看見不合理的事他就干涉。中國人的公共道德建築在兩句話上：「紙掃個人門前雪，休管他人瓦上稱。」比如在一條馬路上，隣居門口垃圾成堆，臭不可聞，普通人見了就是心裏駡上兩句，絕不會出頭干涉的。我以爲這個閒事大可以管一管，因爲一條馬路全都潔凈，就是你的家有垃圾，我們是定要他弄乾凈，最太的理由，臭死隣居事小，至街的潔凈爲大。這又好此，中華民國是我們的，政府是我們的，事無大小，凡足以影饗我們人民的事我們都得管。有貪污的官史我們檢舉他，因爲他是我們的公僕，我們不檢舉他反過來向他送禮，還有比這更卑鄙下流的麼？第二，我們的人民，事事都黨得無組織，看不起組織，你如告訴他，釣魚也來個會，他一定要駡你無聊，因爲事事有組織，才能集體研究，有進步，也才有力量。我們得明自，世界上絕沒有一個民族各自爲政可以存在的，中國幾千年來歷史的敎訓還不够麼？</p>
<p>我今天提倡管閒事，但條件是與大家有關的閒事，不是一個人的閒事。（十，廿九，靑島）</p>
<h3>時間問題</h3>
<p>— 方仁</p>
<p>國人對於處理一切事情，向抱「差不多」主義，尤其對於時間的觀念很薄弱，凡是開會，訂定的是上午九時，在九時正開得起來，絕無僅有，即使到十時十一時開得起來與否，也沒有一定；因此，信守時間的人，反而大上其當。</p>
<p>尤其是近幾年來，時間的變動很多；如在抗戰時，後方所採用的是隴流區時間，要比當地的時間有遲至一小時的，於是機關與人民的鐘往往不一致，出什麼通告之類，在時間下面得加以註解。</p>
<p>又如本月一日起，政府通令：廢止夏令時刻，鐘點撥慢一小時。這事本來很簡單，但經人一追問，要加說明時，往往越說越糊塗。</p>
<p>我的孩子在小學里讀書，先一天回來說：先生呌我們從明天起　一小時到學校里去。我漫應了，在晚上把鐘撥慢了一小時。第二天早上，孩子一看，只有八點鐘，說是還早，他不知道鐘已撥慢，時問仍然是一樣，但他再也弄不明白，究竟是怎麼一回事。</p>
<p>看了今天報紙上電影院的廣告，對於恢復普通時刻一點，大多特予註解；有「老鐘點」，「冬令鐘點」，「標準時間」等等分別。其實這些註解，若加推敲，都有語病，也正是越註解越糊塗。</p>
<p>其實世界萬爾旣有格林威治（Greenwich）標準時間的規定，有國際性的事件，儘可加註該種時間，平常應用，則以當地時刻爲宜。因我國區械遼闊，時區斷難劃一；即節約日光，也儘可提早鐘點，固無須常常撥鐘，反而弄得不能一致或發生其他因時間上計算錯誤的流弊。</p>
<h3>感情的風雨</h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>「新慾燄」觀感</p>
<p>看過了「新慾潮」，回到家已經將近午夜十二點，我內心交渾着錯綜的激情，眼前洋溢着爲一首詩歌所漓沒而未曾流出的眼淚。</p>
<p>我伏在書桌上低垂了頭，又不經意地噴出了一口烟。那樸素的叙述；在我心頭展開了一個印象：——</p>
<p>像一彎淸溪似地，緩緩地傾流着。偶爾，撞擊着一小石子，廻曲地形成了兩股水，然後，又自然地彙合；是那麼勻貼地彙合在一起。</p>
<p>這是一曲蒼凉的夜歌，嗎得够哀怨的了；然而，更令我神往的，却是那一股震憾我靈魂的人情味。</p>
<p>觀厭了那些穿紅着　繼的美國片，我想你不妨去看一看這張片子；我保證這是一張自具風格的作品。</p>
<p>故事的開始，寫工程師安德瑞——這是一個法國典型的神經質的男子，通過了妻弟的關係，認識巴黎女郞方莎，方莎是各厭倦於週旋在煩囂的僞善的社交圈子底人。這兩個悲劇性格的邂逅，再加上女妻的良善與寬仁便促成這不幸故事底頂點。</p>
<p>却爾斯鮑育飾工程師，他的修養與理解，決定他精湛的演技，幾乎使他在這張片子裏無懈可擊。同時，由於他是法國人，他的生活，習慣和種種內在或外在的條件，使他在這張片中的成就超過他所有在好萊塢攝襲的美語片。方莎一角又法國紅星蜜姬瑪　飾演。沒有問題的，他給予我一個非常良好的印象，她始終在這嗣戲裏平穩地漸漸地透出她應有的一抹淡紫色的光輝，一點沒有爲求個人討好觀衆而不惜突破整個劇中所要求造成和諧氣氛的淺薄相。</p>
<p>我熟誠推介，這是一張好影片。我無法在影片本身考慮到我是否應該在稱譽之餘，再加上一些連心的詆辭；以眩示自己的憲眼與卓識。唯一使我不滿的是牠的中文譯名太不恰當。不如直接譯成「暴風雨」似乎還比較妥當些。（十月三十日深夜）</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯揭露　四強外交秘密</h3>
<p>— 珊</p>
<p>美國前任國務卿貝爾納斯，於十月十五日在美發行他的名著「四强外交秘密」，在這裏他把親眼目覩的國際衝突內幕，完全予以揭露。這本名著發行之後，震動全世界，尤共是蘇聯。該書第九節叙述日本投降前後的一切外交秘密，兩足珍貴，茲特擇尤選譯，俾讀者先覩爲快。按全書已譯竣，即日由新聞天地社出版及總發行，預約處本　發行科。</p>
<p>我們必須永遠不要忘記第二次世界大戰是在太平洋爆發的。</p>
<p>一九四五年九月一日米蘇里艦上閉幕的戲劇，是在一九三一年同月開塲於滿洲。繩之而發生的一幕又一幕，是我們在美國的人們所關注的——首先是義大利在一九三五年侵入阿比西尼亞，繼之又有一九三六年西班牙的內戰，一九三七年日本的進攻中國，一九三八年奧地里與捷克的淪陷，以及一九三九年希特勒的進攻波蘭。但是所有這事件已把我們引到一九四一午十二月七日悲慘的珍珠港事件。</p>
<p>假使我們把歐洲視做可能的世界大戰的導火綫，那末我們就必須把亞洲看做一團很大的潛伏着的火種。那里佔這世界上大多數的人民，亟待文明的擇携。所不幸的，中國一戰未已一戰又起。我們的熱忱努力，至少在眼前已經失敗。而日本以吸收近代文明佔有先着，進步却很！著。日本人民從封建和傳統的經濟制度，和宗敎束縛中解放了出來，一切革新，無不爲民生社會之發軔。凡　進步，要須歸功於麥克阿瑟元帥的指揮有方，而我們維持日京制度之存在，以執行最高帥的命令和政策，也是已着成效。</p>
<p>七月十七日，杜魯門總統和史達林元帥初次會而，討論蘇俄向日作戰之舉。史元帥說，他還沒有和中國締約——這是蘇俄對日宣職的先決條件。在會議結束之後，將和宋子文院長，繼籲談判。關於大連港的主權，是一個尚待解決的問題，杜魯門總統宣稱，美國堅決要大連保持爲通商港。史達林回答道，如果蘇俄獲得其管轉權，那末這個狀態是可以實現的。當時我就指出，　據羅斯福總統所參予的雅爾遠密約，中國應保持掌握大連的主權。</p>
<h3>公務員的健康</h3>
<p>— 姚寅仲</p>
<p>前幾天，（十月廿六日）申報上刋出奧國楨市長在平談話。他說外國行政效率高，不外三種原因：一是待遇高，足維生活；二是有定期休假，使身心獲得調　，重新工作時效率倍增；三是退休後有養老金，無後顧之憂。他特別强關第二點，因此他主張我國也應仿效實行。他又說他自做了上海一市的首長以後，體格已大不如前，貫下似有不勝感　的樣十。</p>
<p>考吳市畏的意思，實在就是健康問題。西諺有云：「健全之精神，寓於健全之身體」，健康實在是人生的至寶。吾人無論幹何導事業，都非有健康的身體不可，更不用說起辦公務的人了。尤其不要說像吳市長這樣一位人物，就是地位遠在吳市長以下的無數小公務魚，又何嘗不然！</p>
<p>公務員是國家的命吏，是爲國家執行公務的人。公務員之中，也不乏優秀份子，他們不惜儀量把心智才力貢獻給國家。政府如不能對此輩公務員的健康加以切實注意，而聽任他們病斃瘦死，實在是國家無比的損失。</p>
<h3>同治帝軼聞</h3>
<p>— 羣琳</p>
<p>有淸二代十位皇帝中，以同治帝駕崩時年最少，故人多流言帝喜微服冶辦致染惡疾而逝，此說確否姑不可信，而帝嘗喜便衣外遊，則爲事實。茲錄其軼聞數則如下：同治帝嘗便衣由後宰門出遊，湖南舉人某，居會館與湘鄉侯寓齊相對，一日在床休息，見有少年入，就案翻視其文，以笨塗抹殆遍，匆匆即去，怪而詢諸僕，僕曰：此曾大人之客也，曾大人出外未回，故信步至老爺處耳。及曾歸，舉人白其狀，曾大驚曰：此當今皇上也，舉人恐甚，竟不敢入春關，即日束裝歸去。同治帝嘗親至琉璃廠購玉版宣，以瓜子金抵其値，紙店掌櫃見非通用物，辭不受，乃令店夥隨去取資，至午門店夥不敢入，葉紙倉皇歸，翌日，帝則遺小內監數償之。一日出遊，途中遇雨，避雨僧寮，　一人，窮殊甚，詢其所執何業，乃某貴家厮養卒也，爲主人所逐，故托缽香積廚，以圖果腹，又問如爾輩以何處出息最優，則以粵海關對，帝遂借紙筆作一兩，囑交步軍統領衙門，代爲位置，時某親責任九門提督，接函，即予金治裝，赴粵海關承役，其人遂以起家焉。內監安得海不法，帝幼時，已稔其奸，常以小刀斷泥人首，請其故，則曰殺小安子，後同治八年，安得海僞稱奉旨差遺，出京織辦龍衣，過德州　，招搖過甚，知州趙新稟報山東巡撫丁賓　，丁關據奏聞，同治接閱丁奏，立即降旨，令將安得海就地正法，迨孝欽后聞知，雖欲救護，然己無及矣。</p>
<h3>關於失嫁女</h3>
<p>— 羊仁</p>
<p>日前本刋有一篇「寄失嫁女」的文章，大意是說女子的失嫁，一方面由於一部分男子不勝負担結婚的費用。一方面還是由於一部分女子奪去了男子的職業，以致男子因失業而無力結婚。故結論是女子應該因到家里去，進備做新娘。這些意見，當然自有其事實的根據，不爲無理，但就女性應該掃除依賴，謀取獨立的意義上說，總覺得未敢贊同。我以爲子的失嫁，另外還有一僑大原因在：現在我們的婚姻制度，是舊的未死，新的雖生而未又成；在新舊交替的隔縫里，却苦悶了許多靑年男女！而女子失嫁，更成爲社會上管遍而嚴重的問題。正因爲有一條新舊之間尚未合擺的隔縫，所以走上前的，站在時代尖端的，以及退落後的，生活在舊社會底層的，都不會惑到什麽窒息和不快；惟有不前不後適當隔純中間的人，那纔是傎正的苦悶者。也就是說，只有那曾經受過時代敎育的流禮，而禮敎觀念尚未完全脫盡的半新不舊的女性，纔是隔縫中傎正苦悶的</p>
<p>男女不權，社交公開，那是早已聽爛了的口號，但實際上到什麽地方去公開社交呢，却又百思不得其所了。尤其女子方面，一跳舞塲，在總會，由於這種地方的「質的問題」，稍一涉足，指摘隨之，禮敎繩子，束縛得你只能裏足不前。一般尚有封建氣息的父母們，對於兒女婚姻，滿口「聽其自由」，但當傎活動得自由一點時，便又監督基嚴，甚至嘖有煩言。自由擇配旣不可能，盲目婚姻又非所願，於是就在這樣一個新舊脫節的環境里——十條黑暗的隔縫——不知埋送了幾許靑春年少！</p>
<p>當然，女子失嫁，並不完全屬於這個原因，但婚姻制度的不合理——新舊脫節，不能統一，使一班欲新不能，欲舊不甘的小姐們無所適從，實在是虛度芳齡的最大癮給。</p>
<h3>積重難返</h3>
<p>— 中立</p>
<p>巴頓將軍在歐戰時接到總司令部一個電報，叫他在報告中少帶詼諧，因爲那些報告將成歷史記載的一部份。電文末訓令他：「繞道而過特里爾，攻佔該城時，需用兵力四師圍。」但當電報到達時，特里爾業經攻下。巴頓覆電答通：「該城已用二師兵力攻下，要不要還給德軍再來。」</p>

<h3>Chairman Concerned About Election Progress; Handwritten Order for Central Election Guidance Committee; Candidate List Must Be Submitted for Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] It has been learned that due to recent criticisms from various parties regarding certain technical issues in the election process, especially concerning nominations, the Chairman has paid close attention and has personally ordered the Central Election Guidance Committee to ensure that the current list of candidates under review must be submitted for his approval after being proposed by senior officials. It is said that the Chairman may consider external opinions, and personnel from provincial-level election reporting committees will not be allowed to participate in the election. If this can be achieved, some of the already approved candidates will withdraw.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The review of the list of National Assembly representative candidates has now concluded. The review of the list of Legislative Yuan member candidates will begin in a week.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Kuomintang Comrades Friendship Association of the Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, Political Consultative Council, and Constitutional Promotion Association held a symposium at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 4th, focusing on election issues. Legislative member Li Yuanbai presided. Political Council member Wang Guanwu, National Assembly representative Chen Qianxi, and others spoke, respectively reporting the Political Council members' three proposals regarding the general election and the contents of the National Assembly Friendship Association's letter to Chairman Chiang. General opinions at the meeting expressed dissatisfaction with the current election policy, believing that there were phenomena such as monopolization and election reporting committee members also participating in the election. All agreed with the three proposals of the Political Council members. It was decided to draft a telegram and submit it to Chairman Chiang for review. The telegram will be finalized after review.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Political Council Members Friendship Association convened a meeting at 9 AM on the 4th to discuss election issues, chaired by Da Pusheng. It passed the three proposals regarding the general election and decided to send representatives to personally present these opinions to Chairman Chiang. Some mentioned convening a temporary National Assembly and requesting nominations as candidates, but it was not approved. Finally, a suggestion was passed to convene the fifth plenary session of the fourth Political Council by the Resident Committee, considering it as the last meeting before the implementation of the plan, to discuss issues such as proposals to the National Assembly. The content of the three proposals is recorded as follows: For the past ten years, the Political Council has strived for unification, resistance against Japan, and the implementation of constitutional government. Since victory, the country has been in turmoil, but the association firmly believes that only by implementing constitutional government can the foundation of the country be stabilized. Therefore, they deeply appreciate the government's decision to hold the general election as scheduled. However, whether constitutional government can be smoothly promoted and fully realized will depend on a basic premise: whether this general election can gather talents from across the country. Therefore, the association believes that this general election must take "selecting the virtuous and capable" as the highest principle. To carefully select individuals, the association has suggested a nomination method by political parties, as this is the only relatively reasonable method today. Now that the government has decided to adopt the political party nomination method, we sincerely hope that all political parties, in the nomination process, will also demonstrate a spirit beyond party affiliation, use talent as the standard, and strive for fairness as much as possible, avoiding the current bias.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The announcement of National Assembly representative candidates is scheduled to be held simultaneously in various electoral districts by local election offices on the 6th. Furthermore, the list of candidates should be submitted to the general office by the 20th of this month to be compiled and archived. However, the part nominated by political parties will be sent to the general office for review by the parties in the short term before being telegraphed to various districts for announcement. The announcement of National Assembly representative candidates from national occupational and women's election offices will be handled in two batches on the 6th and 10th.</p>

It is believed that the Jilin National Army will soon launch an attack. The war around Fanjiatun in Changnan has subsided today. It is rumored that the bandit troops of the 2nd Column, who harassed Jilin, have infiltrated the Changnan battlefield, but the military has not confirmed this. The automotive transit between Yang and Siping has been smooth in recent days, greatly assisting the war along the Dongliao River. In the encirclement battle in the northwest of Yixian in western Liaoning, although the National Army suffered heavy casualties, the Communist bandits suffered even greater casualties, about 15,000 or more. The encirclement and further encirclement are continuing.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Deputy Minister of National Defense Qin Decun pointed out in a military report at the political affairs meeting on the 4th that the Northeast Communist Army originally planned to attack Jilin to seize Xiaofengman, but now the offensive has been thwarted. The China Changchun Railway has also been opened to Sipingjie, the siege of Beipiao has been lifted, and the railway has also been opened.

Large corps of troops will successively point to Shizhuang, and the National Army will be able to drive back the bandits outside Shi.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 4th] Military authorities said: The National Army has been airlifting troops from the north and south to reinforce Shijiazhuang for four days now. Fighting still continues in Xiecun, southeast of Shijiazhuang.</p>
<h3>Hebei Plans to Suppress Bandits; Shangguan Yunxiang Arrives in Beijing with Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Shangguan Yunxiang, deputy director of the Baoding Pacification Office, arrived in Beijing yesterday. According to his words to reporters, the military and political leaders of Hebei Province have thoroughly reviewed the work of suppressing bandits in the area and formulated a plan, which he brought with him. He will visit Chairman Chiang in the next few days to report and request instructions.</p>
<h3>People of Southern Shanxi Rise Up to Resist Bandits; Use Hoes as Weapons</h3>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 3rd] Xiangning City was captured by the bandits after Jixian City. The defending troops transferred to the countryside to continue resisting the bandits. The people in the fourth district of Yongji could not bear the devastation of the Communist bandits and rose up to defend themselves with hoes and sickles. On October 13th, more than 3,000 people gathered, armed with a small number of guns and hoes, under the leadership of Qin Zhonghe, who once served in the Youth Army, and occupied Juncun, destroyed the Communist district office, and killed thirty or forty local ruffians who were "settling old scores." They further occupied Zhaocun and recovered Fenglingdu. By the 20th, they had not received reinforcements. Zhaocun was besieged by bandits and fought fiercely for two days and nights. When the ammunition ran out, it was captured by the bandits. Many who did not escape were stabbed to death, and reprisals were taken against the people, affecting several villages in the vicinity, such as Dongzhu. Eyes were gouged out, feet were cut off, and people were beaten to death with stones and sticks, resulting in hundreds of deaths and a terrifying situation where there was no one on the road.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle for Yulin; National Army in Western Henan Enters Chidafeng</h3>
<p>[Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 4th] Military news: The battle in Jianlin has reached its peak. The Lingyunta position in the suburbs has been fought over six times, inflicting heavy damage on the bandits.

According to the news: the Communist army's Fourth Brigade has the appearance of fleeing north to Yimeng, attempting to obstruct the National Army from Suiyuan from going south.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yulin, 3rd] From 5:30 PM on the 2nd, the bandits concentrated heavy artillery to bombard the southeast city and the Hongfan Wenchang Tower highlands in the city, and launched an all-out attack from all sides, especially the southeast and southwest corners of the city, and the south and north gates, which were the most fierce. The bandits launched dozens of fierce attacks, but were bravely repelled by the defending troops. The bandits suffered more than 3,000 casualties. At dawn on the 3rd, the bandits concentrated seven heavy artillery pieces again and launched an all-out attack on the Jiezai position in the North Gate.

<h3>British Delegation Visits; Amory Broadcasts Farewell Message; All Sino-British Issues Can Be Resolved Through Negotiation</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] The British Parliamentary Delegation visited the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, Huanghuagang, Sun Yat-sen University, and the hospital on the morning of the 4th. The British Consulate held a banquet at 1:00 PM, received reporters at 5:00 PM, and went to the Changti Haizhu Theater to watch Cantonese opera at 9:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] When the British Delegation received reporters, they specifically and solemnly denied again the talk of opening China's inland river navigation rights. Today, they seem to have kept their mouths shut on any issue. When reporters asked about the Hong Kong issue, the leader of the delegation, Amory, replied with a rather unhappy expression that he did not intend to express any opinions on this. He only said that China and Britain are currently facing economic crises, so they should help each other and overcome difficulties. Regarding Sino-British trade issues, he said that whether there is trade between the two countries now, what China needs most is machinery, and Britain will import factory machinery to China as much as possible under possible circumstances. Finally, he said that the friendship between China and Britain is deeply rooted. In the future, all issues related to China and Britain can be resolved through negotiations. The leader of the delegation, Lord Amory, also broadcasted a farewell message to the Chinese people on Guangzhou Radio at 8:00 PM. (Continued on column 1 of page 2)</p>
<h3>Contents of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement; Not Yet Time to Announce; Guo Dehua's Conversation with Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] Guo Dehua, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, said that there are no problems in principle with the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, but the contents of the agreement are not yet ready for announcement. He also said: We currently need to be self-reliant on some issues. Why do we rely on the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement alone?</p>
<h3>Taiwan Permanently Belongs to the Motherland; Yang Jia Denounces the Philippines' Absurd Claims; Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs Denies Opposing Ryukyu's Return to Us</h3>
<p>The Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs Denies Opposing Ryukyu's Return to Us</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Manila Bulletin of the Philippines advocates that Taiwan implement "self-determination." Various parties here are deeply surprised by this proposal, which deliberately obliterates the facts. Yang Jia, Chairman of the Taiwan Reconstruction Association, especially issued a statement to reporters on the 4th, saying: Taiwan is forever the territory of China. The people of Taiwan are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Although they have undergone more than fifty years of violent rule by Japanese invaders, their pure bloodline has never changed. The suggestion of the Philippine newspaper, if true, is truly absurd. I believe that none of the people of Taiwan are willing to break away from the embrace of the motherland. Taiwan was able to return to the motherland after the eight-year War of Resistance, and all Taiwanese compatriots felt excited. Although the subsequent development of events has not fully met the hopes of the Taiwanese people, this has caused various rumors from the outside world. However, I can assert that the Taiwanese people have absolutely no tendency to break away from the motherland. The glorious historical facts of Zheng Chenggong's leadership of the Taiwanese people in resisting the Manchus and defending Taiwan 280 years ago, and the countless martyrs, such as Qiu Fengjia, who followed one after another after the Japanese invaders occupied the land, and strived to restore the lost land, will forever be the glory of the Taiwanese people. Today's Taiwanese people will undoubtedly follow in the footsteps of their ancestors and strive to defend Taiwan and rebuild Taiwan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 4th] The Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a brief statement denying the news intercepted by the Manila Bulletin yesterday. The statement said: "No Philippine diplomatic official has ever issued such a statement, and no diplomatic official is prepared to take steps to oppose China's claim based on the reasons given. The reasons given are: The Philippines opposes China's claim because if the Ryukyu Islands are placed under the complete rule of a single foreign country, the strategic position of Ryukyu may endanger the position of the Philippines." (The Manila Bulletin also issued absurd arguments; content published in the second column of page 2)</p>
<h3>We Will Send Personnel to the United States Immediately; To Receive the Ships Donated to Us; Government Reception Personnel Expenses</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The United States donated ships to us, and we decided to send personnel to accept them immediately. The Executive Yuan passed a bill at its regular meeting on the 4th to pay the necessary expenses for the receiving personnel.</p>
<h3>Joint Committee of the Legislative Yuan Resolves; No Need to Amend the Postal Law</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The Ministry of Communications proposed to amend Article 4 of the Postal Law to simplify the procedures for increasing postage, so that future postage adjustments only need to be formulated by the Ministry of Communications and sent to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then implemented without going through the legislative process. This case was examined by the Joint Committee of the Legislative Yuan's Economics, Finance, and Legal Systems Committees on the morning of the 4th. Tao Fengshan, Director of the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications, and Xue Yawen, a senior official of the Postal Administration, attended the meeting to explain that the Postal Administration has suffered huge losses in recent years. According to estimates, even if the postage for ordinary letters is increased to 3,000 yuan, there will still be a monthly loss of 50 billion yuan. If the entire amount is subsidized by the national treasury, it will indirectly increase the burden on the people. Therefore, the only way is to adopt a two-pronged policy of subsidies and price increases. However, in the past, each adjustment had to go through the legislative process, and often the prices would rise before the Legislative Yuan passed it. In order to simplify the procedures, this suggestion was made. In addition, the Joint Committee is planning a method for calculating the price increases of public utilities, and it seems that postage adjustments can also be used. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan members spoke, pointing out that although the Legislative Yuan has questioned postage adjustments in the past, there has been no delay, so it is not enough to use this as a reason to amend the Postal Law. Some Legislative Yuan members expressed dissatisfaction with the Postal Administration's waste of public funds and construction of beautiful post offices, and argued that the authorities should come to the Legislative Yuan to explain the entire fiscal policy. Finally, it was resolved that Article 4 of the Postal Law should not be amended, and that future postage increases should still complete the legislative process.</p>
<h3>Merger of Banks and Treasury Re-submitted for Review by the Economic and Financial Committee of the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The merger of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury was re-submitted for review by the Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economic Committees on the morning of the 4th. Li Qing reported on the previous reviews, explaining that the representatives of each bank and bureau believed that the merger at this time would affect finance and reduce overseas remittances. At the same time, there were many technical difficulties in implementation, so they advocated for a postponement. Yu Zhenying and others believed that technical difficulties were not a reason, and that the failure to absorb overseas remittances was purely the result of the authorities' wrong foreign exchange policy, so they advocated for the merger and resolved to re-submit it for review.</p>
<h3>US Congressmen Value Aid to China; Special Congress Will Have Good Results; Zhou Yide Leaves Shanghai Today to Return Home</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Foreign Minister Wang reported on diplomacy at the Political Affairs Meeting on the 4th. Regarding the issue of US aid to China, Wang emphasized: This matter has reached a new stage of development. In addition to explaining the importance of aid to China, Wang also informed that the members of the US Senate and House of Representatives all believed that aid to Europe should also aid China, and that aid to China is part of the US government's plan to aid independent countries. Wang believes that this case may have good results at the US Special Congress on the 17th of this month.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] The US Embassy announced: According to the US-China agreement signed last month on the 7th for a total of US$30,000 for union relief after the end of the war, US$27 million has been allocated to purchase and ship urgently needed relief supplies, and 50,000 tons of wheat and 43,000 tons of rice will be purchased from the United States, and 30,000 tons of rice will be purchased from Thailand for use in China.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Zhou Yide left Beijing on a US military special plane at 9:00 AM on the 4th to fly to Shanghai. Ambassador Stuart and Director Ling Qihan both went to the Daxiaochang base to see him off. Zhou is scheduled to leave for the United States on the 5th to prepare reports on his visits to various parts of the world and immediately explain the current situation in China to the American people. Zhou declared in Beijing: If the US government only proposes aid to Europe at the interim congress that opens on the 17th, he will unite his comrades to call for the determination of a global diplomatic policy and demand aid to China.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg Delivers Speech; US Foreign Aid Plan Should Include China</h3>
<p>[US News Agency, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 3rd] US Senate President Vandenberg delivered a speech here today supporting the US aid to Europe plan and hoping to trust the United Nations to maintain peace. He delivered the speech at the University of Michigan's celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Dutch leaving civilians on this continent. At the time, Vandenberg and Dutch Ambassador to the United States and Security Council Representative Kleffens both received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees. Vandenberg endorsed the short-term aspect of the Marshall Plan, believing that it contained "the basic survival of humanity in a free society," and called the long-term plan "the practice of self-help and self-sufficiency." He suggested that China be included in these plans and urged implementation to ensure hope of success and to understand that the United States "cannot indefinitely aid the world."</p>
<h3>Civil Servant Insurance Law; Draft Prepared, Awaiting Legislative Yuan Review</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan Approves the Expansion of the Goods Supply and Marketing Office</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The draft of the Civil Servant Insurance Law, which is related to the welfare of civil servants throughout the country, has been prepared by relevant parties and will be implemented after the legislative process is completed. According to the law, civil servants should be universally insured. In the event of injury, illness, retirement, or death, they will be given "insurance benefits" and free medical care. Civil servants who retire or die in accordance with the law should be paid insurance money in separate amounts. Insurance premiums are shared equally by the civil servants and their service institutions. The insurance premiums borne by the service institutions are included in the annual budget.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Issue of Levying Business Tax on the Grain Industry</h3>
<p>The question of whether or not to levy business tax on the grain industry is indeed a matter of considerable importance. From our past and present policies, it is not difficult to see the government's taxation policy towards the food industry:</p>
<p>The "likin" was known as a commodity tax, because it was levied on all kinds of goods; but grain alone was allowed to be exempt;</p>
<p>All imported goods are subject to tax according to the customs tariff, with very few exceptions; but grains such as rice and flour have also been exempt from tax.</p>
<p>Whenever there are floods or droughts, and serious problems occur with the people's food supply, transportation agencies such as trains and ships often reduce freight rates and prioritize transportation. The "Methods for Rewarding Rice Purchases" promulgated by the Shanghai Municipal Government have not yet been abolished.</p>
<p>Why does grain receive such preferential treatment? The answer is simple: "Food is the paramount necessity of the people," because it is related to the lives and well-being of the general public. In our country, it is called the "eating problem," while in foreign countries it is called the "bread problem." This problem is the core of all political and economic problems, and also the focus of all domestic and international issues. If it is not handled well, or if there is no effective response, it can easily lead to an irreparable disaster. Therefore, after the victory, the central government once postponed the business tax on the grain industry for one year, and then approved another extension for one year, which expired at the end of September this year. This also shows the authorities' attention to the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Now that the period of extension has expired again, the appeals from grain industry associations in various regions and the National Federation of Commerce have not yet taken effect, so people in the industry are panicking, and the public is also gradually paying attention. This is because the transportation and sale of agricultural products involves too many transfers from the producer to the consumer. According to industry insiders, the grain must go through six transfers from the place of production through the rice millers, wholesalers, transporters, operators, sales wholesalers, and retailers. Each transfer is a business transaction, and each must pay 1.5% business tax according to the business tax law; and the so-called 1.5% tax rate is calculated based on the sales amount. Then, if the original cost of one dan of rice is assumed to be 600,000 yuan, based on adding 1.5% to the value of the goods each time, after six transfers, and other expenses are not counted, it will have to be as high as 656,065 yuan to break even. Therefore, nominally, although it is said to be 1.5% per hundred, in reality it will be as high as 9.1% per hundred. At a time when efforts are being made to suppress rice prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, it is indeed worth considering whether the tax exemption period should be terminated.</p>
<p>According to normal theory, all citizens have the obligation to pay taxes, and grain merchants are also part of the citizenry, and naturally have their due responsibilities. The problem is that the same goods have to be taxed repeatedly up to six times. The question is whether this is legally and reasonably justifiable, and it should not be overlooked. Those who advocate levying the tax can of course say: this is levied on grain merchants, not on grain, so it does not constitute double taxation. But in fact, it is calculated based on the sales amount of the business, and its nature is no different from a sales tax. According to the result of tax shifting, this repeated taxation will undoubtedly still fall on the food consumers. Therefore, no matter how it is transformed, in practice it is inevitably repeated taxation.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned repeated taxation, even from the perspective of the basic law on business tax, also seems impermissible in principle. Article 2 of the Business Tax Law revised in May of this year lists seven types of businesses that are exempt from tax, the fourth of which is "factories or producers that have already paid factory tax or product tax." May I ask why these factories or producers are allowed to be exempt from tax? Is it because they have already paid factory tax or product tax? Grain is also a product. At least after it has been milled white by a rice mill, it cannot but be considered a product of the factory or production. Why should it still be taxed repeatedly? Is this contrary to the original intention of the legislation?</p>
<p>According to item 7 of Article 2 of the revised Business Tax Law, "small businesses such as those who carry goods on their shoulders and sell rice, grains, miscellaneous grains, vegetables, poultry, etc." are all allowed to be exempt from tax. It can be seen that the business tax on rice, grains, and miscellaneous grains can originally be exempted. What is not allowed to be exempted is only grain merchants with a larger scope, not small businesses. However, from the standpoint of the business operator, there is indeed a distinction between large and small scope, but from the standpoint of the object of the business, that is, grain, officials have not distinguished between what should be exempted and what should be taxed; because as a result of the tax shifting, it will ultimately fall on the users. Merely exempting a small portion of the business tax on the retail side at the final stage has no deep relationship with the public, and it is just a sign of the incompleteness of the grain tax exemption policy. According to household surveys, for families with lower incomes, the proportion consumed on food is particularly large. Therefore, wages in the countryside are now often calculated in terms of rice or rice prices. In urban areas, although most have changed to issuing according to the cost of living index, there are still many who provide meals or issue rice subsidies. It can be seen that the rice problem is indeed very important. Now the central government and the local governments of various provinces and cities are trying to find ways to suppress rice prices in order to stabilize society, such as setting price limits, cracking down on hoarding and speculation, strictly prohibiting smuggling out of the country, implementing large-scale sales, issuing rationed rice at parity prices, planning overall rationing, rushing to transport grain in advance, protecting rice merchants who purchase rice, and not allowing them to be hindered or extorted along the way. These many methods are different in form, but the goal is the same. Then, at a time when rice prices are fluctuating, suddenly levying taxes repeatedly on grain that was originally exempt from tax in the name of business tax, does this conform to the government's original policy? It is hoped that the competent authorities can carefully reconsider. It should be known that the formerly heinous likin, after repeated improvements, only levied one tax in the end; after one tax, it was allowed to go wherever it went, and no longer taxed repeatedly. This can at least be done in this province. Now, the grain that was specially exempted from the likin in the past is now repeatedly taxed, up to five or six times. This always seems incomprehensible. Therefore, under the call to stabilize people's livelihoods, the question of whether or not to levy business tax on the grain industry is indeed worthy of our attention.</p>

<h3>Lord Ammon's Broadcast in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Among them, he highly praised the heroic struggles of our country's universities and other cultural institutions under the worst circumstances. He also praised the rehabilitation and construction work in various parts of our country, especially in Chongqing. Regarding the Communist rebellion, Lord Ammon said: "If 80% of China's tax revenue is still used for suppressing the rebellion, then the hope of restoring normalcy will be hindered and almost impossible, but everyone can anticipate the extra burden and is bravely dealing with it. Regarding the group's trip to our country, he said: "We are extremely impressed by your country's abundant natural resources, food production and the potential for industrial development, and especially commendable are those responsible for education in Gu University and other educational institutions, who bravely overcome great difficulties despite major obstacles such as damaged buildings and incomplete equipment, so that the next generation can complete their studies and take on more arduous responsibilities. The group was also deeply moved by the people's hard work, enduring pleasure and harmony. He said: He has seen China's vast productivity. British expatriates in China have told the visiting delegation that they will do their best to cooperate with China and not let China down. Lord Ammon concluded: "We are about to return home, and we now have a deeper understanding that the friendship between our two countries will be permanently linked."</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th] Lord Ammon, head of the British Parliamentary Delegation to China, denied that the delegation was directly investigating the future of Sino-British trade. Lord Ammon criticized a report from Nanjing by an American news agency, which claimed: "The British Parliamentary Delegation to China is a friendship delegation. The delegation is here only as a guest of the Chinese government."</p>
<h3>The Manila Bulletin Again Publishes Erroneous Views</h3>
<p>Actually Advocating Trusteeship of Ryukyu and Taiwan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 4th] The American-run Manila Bulletin today published an editorial supporting the proposal for the United Nations to place the Ryukyu Islands under trusteeship, and suggested that a similar trusteeship be applied to Taiwan. According to the newspaper, "China's claim to the Ryukyu Islands is based on the simple fact that the island of Okinawa and the rest of the Ryukyu Islands once belonged to China in ancient times, but the battle of Okinawa did indeed sacrifice many American soldiers' lives, so the United States seems unlikely to be prepared to agree to hand over the Ryukyu Islands. It also stated: "United Nations trusteeship will grant Okinawa a degree of self-determination that it has never had in its past history, and will provide the people of Okinawa with a protection that they themselves cannot afford." Regarding Taiwan, the newspaper stated: "The independence and self-determination of the Korean people has now become a global issue and one of the most thorny issues in international politics, but no one has yet heard any statements applying the same principle of self-determination to Taiwan. The Taiwanese, like the Okinawans, have been under Japanese rule for many years before the war. If the Taiwanese were consulted on this issue, they might express their preference to continue to be ruled by China, but they have never had any opportunity to express their opinions on this issue in a global organization.</p>
<h3>Singapore Authorities' Maladministration; Seven Hundred Overseas Chinese Detained and on Hunger Strike</h3>
<p>Have Ceased After Accepting Persuasion</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Singapore, 3rd] The Dutch ship "Poseidon" recently arrived in Singapore from Hong Kong. Seven hundred and four Chinese third-class passengers on board were detained at the St. John's Island Quarantine Station for two weeks due to the lack of epidemic prevention certificates. However, the food and accommodation were poor, and the entire group went on a hunger strike in protest, which is now in its third day.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Singapore, 4th] Our Consul General Wu Bosheng and overseas Chinese reporters this morning again visited our overseas Chinese who were detained outside the harbor of St. John's Island awaiting quarantine. They finally accepted persuasion and stopped the hunger strike, but only agreed to accept food donated by overseas Chinese organizations, and still refused what was supplied by the quarantine authorities. At the same time, they raised points of dissatisfaction and several demands, urging the local government to pay attention. They demanded that the quarantine station treat our overseas Chinese fairly in the future and improve the food and accommodation so that fellow countrymen who come in the future will not suffer the same pain, and also requested that medical examinations be carried out immediately for newly arrived overseas Chinese so that they can leave the quarantine station earlier. Representatives of the local government promised to investigate immediately, and Wu will continue to negotiate. The press corps' visit today confirmed the grievances of the overseas Chinese. The quarantine station is indeed like a crowded lunatic asylum, with more than two hundred people sharing one water fountain, and sharing insufficient amounts of rice and rotten sweet potatoes, in addition to a small amount of other food.</p>

<h3>Draft of the New Constitution of Malaya; Implications of Suppressing Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Liu Weizhi Claims We Have Paid Attention</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Liu Weizhi made a statement on the 4th regarding the strike and market strike by overseas Chinese in Malaya in opposition to the draft new constitutional system of the Federation of Malaya, stating: The draft was mostly advocated by the British government, and the residents of Malaya, whether British, Indian, Malay, or Chinese, are dissatisfied with it. There are four points of concern for the overseas Chinese in opposing the draft: The draft stipulates that only those whose parents and themselves were born in Malaya and have resided there for more than fifteen years can obtain citizenship qualifications, otherwise they must be approved by the Federal High Commissioner. This type of prevention makes it so that very few overseas Chinese will be able to enjoy citizenship rights. Overseas Chinese account for more than 40% of the total population of Malaya, but only 14 seats are available in the 75-member Federal Legislative Council, less than 20% of the proportion, which is obviously not fair. The draft makes it clear that Malays enjoy special privileges with regard to immigration, and there is a tendency to restrict the immigration of other ethnic groups (especially overseas Chinese). Of the more than 2.3 million overseas Chinese, more than 600,000 reside in Singapore. If Singapore is separated from the Federation according to the draft, overseas Chinese will become a minority in the Federation. Liu declared: "The great contributions of overseas Chinese to Malaya in the past are known to the world. Even the British cannot but acknowledge this. It goes without saying that the lives and property of overseas Chinese suffered the greatest sacrifices during the fall of the island. Even after the restoration of Malaya, overseas Chinese have made great contributions to the stability and restoration of order in the region. However, what overseas Chinese hope for is nothing more than fair and reasonable treatment. Now, the new constitutional proposal actually contains the intention of suppressing overseas Chinese, which is truly regrettable." Liu also stated: "This matter is of great importance to the future of overseas Chinese in Malaya, and the people of our country have paid close attention to it, because this is not only a problem of the suppression of more than 2 million overseas Chinese in Malaya, but also a problem of the survival of the entire Chinese nation."</p>
<h3>Student Union of Zhejiang University Decides to Resume Classes Today</h3>
<p>Raising Three Demands Regarding the Yu Zisan Case</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Hangzhou, 4th] The newly elected council of the Student Union of Zhejiang University has been established. It held its first meeting yesterday to discuss the Yu Zisan case, and resolved to demand three points: The school and students establish an accusation committee; Urge the court to quickly try the arrested students; The presidents of the schools go to Beijing to report the situation in detail, and decided to officially resume classes from the 5th. It is reported that President Zhu has already left for Beijing this morning.</p>
<p>Zhejiang High Court Issues a Signed Explanation Regarding the Case</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 4th] Yu Zisan, chairman of the Student Union of Zhejiang University, was arrested on suspicion of being a Communist, and committed suicide out of fear of punishment. The forensic doctor of the High Court examined the body and issued the following identification statement: The body of the deceased Yu Zisan had a laceration wound on the neck, which had cut open the trachea and damaged the thyroid vein in the neck. Furthermore, the bleeding from the injury flowed into the trachea, causing congestion and breathing difficulties, leading to death by suffocation. The deceased's jaw was clenched, the pupils were dilated, the gums and fingers and toes were bluish-purple, and the scrotum's blood vessels were dilated and congested. These conditions are all consistent with the state of suffocation and the circumstances of reflex nerve stimulation due to severe pain from the injury. The stab wound on the neck of the deceased should have been caused by a sharp object, which is consistent with the glass shard that was initially investigated and determined to be the murder weapon. The slight cut on the right thumb of the deceased is consistent with it being caused by gripping the glass shard identified as the murder weapon. According to the above examination, no other injuries or signs of resistance were found on the other parts of the deceased's body, nor were there any circumstances of fatal injury methods. It can be determined that it was not a homicide.</p>
<h3>Hu Shi's Written and Spoken Advice; Advising Peking University Students</h3>
<p>Tsinghua Students Decide to Strike for Three Days</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Peiping, 4th] Hu Shi and Mei Yiqi have repeatedly discussed how to prevent the expansion of the student movement in Peiping, and have contacted the party and government authorities. After Hu spoke with the students of Peking University, he issued a written statement last night, saying that he had telegraphed President Zhu Kezhen to inquire in detail about the Zhejiang University incident, and advised the students of Peking University to be calm, first investigate the facts clearly, and recognize the goals to be achieved. I think there are two goals to be achieved: Those directly responsible should be severely punished; Avoid and prevent similar incidents from happening again. As for how to achieve these goals, we should consider them calmly, and never lightly adopt actions such as strikes and demonstrations, because sacrificing valuable studies will never be able to cope with events that happen outside at any time. Only in a calm attitude can we speak with strength, and only then will people listen to what we say. Otherwise, if we mess up our own order first, we will never be able to cope with the external situation.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Peiping, 4th] Regarding the arrests of students at Zhejiang University and Peking University, the students of Tsinghua University decided late last night to strike for three days starting today. Yenching University is listening to the decision of the "North China Student Union". It is rumored that the school will strike tomorrow. The Peking University Academy Union discussed a one-day strike for six days last night, but the situation is still developing.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Peiping, 4th] Chen Jicheng, commander of the Peiping Garrison, and Mayor He Siyuan issued a statement today, saying that they hope that "members of the Democratic League" will all stop their conspiracy activities, and the government will naturally not hold them accountable for the past and will protect them according to law. On the contrary, if there are still illegal and undisciplined incidents, then no matter who they are, they will be punished according to law.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Peiping, 4th] The Peiping newspapers today published a declaration signed by 47 professors from Peking University, Yenching University, and Tsinghua University, led by Zhou Binglin, Dean of the Law School of Peking University, criticizing the government's announcement that the Democratic League is an illegal organization.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Provincial Assembly Suggests; Circulation of Grain and Materials Between Provinces</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 4th] The Guangdong Provincial Assembly believes that the recent financial turmoil and serious food shortages, while various provinces still have orders prohibiting the export of grain and other materials, is tantamount to a suicidal policy of material blockade.

<h3>Hainan Island Iron Ore</h3>
<p>Total Reserves of 125 Million Tons</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hainan Island, 4th] The iron ore discovered on Hainan Island can be divided into two major producing areas, one is the Shilu Mine, located on the Nanshao Mountain, 54 kilometers northeast of the Basuo Port in Changjiang County, west of the island, with a total reserve of more than 120 million tons. The extracted iron has been tested to be a maximum of 88%, a minimum of 52.3%, and an average of 63%. There are very few impurities such as phosphorus, sulfur, and copper, making it a world-class iron ore. The other producing area is Tiandu, located at Hongni Ridge, 12 kilometers northeast of Yulin Port in Yai County, south of the island, with a total reserve of 5 million tons, mostly magnetite, with an average content of more than 64%. The Japanese invested nearly 200 million Japanese yen in the two iron ore areas, with an annual planned output of 2.4 million tons. From 1930 to 1941, a total of 2.8 million tons were shipped out, and 500,000 tons were stored in Yulin. After the restoration, the various mining areas were taken over by the National Resources Commission, but due to a lack of funds and transportation, they have been abandoned. The mine pits are now gradually collapsing due to water accumulation. Transportation and smelting issues should be paid attention to in future mining.</p>

<h3>Vandenberg's Speech (Continued from Page 1)</h3>
<p>He stated: "People must frankly examine our own resources to avoid harming our own economy. We must ensure sound administration and appropriate cooperation. We cannot evade the responsibility of leadership unless we are prepared to accept the price of losing such leadership."</p>
<p>Regarding the future of the world, Vandenberg criticized the Soviet veto power, stating that it had almost paralyzed the UN Security Council and delayed the drafting of a peace treaty with Germany. He stated: "Germany can restore its self-governance to a level at which it can survive, which is the key to Europe's recovery. It is highly desirable that the Council of Foreign Ministers reach an agreement on this issue. However, I believe that disagreements – whether here or in other places – should not be allowed to unduly delay peace, reconstruction, and self-government. Peace should have priority. I cannot believe that a German peace treaty will sacrifice the inability to find a common ground that can garner majority agreement."</p>
<p>Vandenberg believes that the recent Rio de Janeiro conference is an example of cooperation between countries, and he also pointed out the UN's goal of creating worldwide harmony. He criticized the veto power used by the Soviet Union, stating: "The majority is not necessarily always correct, but to believe that the majority opinion, which originates from the conscience of the world, is continuously in error is a distortion of basic logic." Vandenberg stated that he supports "live and let live," worldwide disarmament, and reliance on the UN to maintain peace. He stated that the Soviet Union's recent statements are "the most appalling anti-American slanders that have ever so painfully struck the world's eardrums."</p>
<p>He continued: "It is said that we are fascists, but in fact, we maintain freedom of speech and free elections, and even strive to maintain these freedoms for those who slander us. It is said that we are economic imperialists, but in fact, we have loaned huge amounts of material, worth hundreds of billions of dollars, to our allies. They also say that we are war-mongers, yet, despite having the atomic bomb, we still request the whole world to join us in banning atomic warfare."</p>
<p>Vandenberg reaffirmed his confidence in a united American foreign policy, stating: "Foreign policy is a legitimate topic for open debate among our citizens. Foreign policy belongs to the people and is a legitimate item for competition among the parties, but I fervently pray that we strive for a non-partisan American foreign policy. Furthermore, foreign policy is not Republican, nor is it Democratic, but American. Such a foreign policy will unite our people in the face of crisis."</p>

<h3>London Four Foreign Ministers Conference to Discuss Japanese Peace Treaty; Possible Change in Soviet Policy Towards Germany</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 4th] Well-informed sources say that the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference this month is expected to discuss the drafting process of a peace treaty with Japan. According to authoritative sources, due to China's non-participation in the Foreign Ministers Conference, the discussions during the meeting will be communicated to China at any time.</p>
<p>[United Press, Berlin, 3rd] Optimism is growing among well-informed sources in British, American, and Soviet circles in Berlin, believing that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in London will at least achieve partial success. The possibility of Germany being divided by the two major forces of East and West is now hardly believed by anyone. Just a month ago, these sources believed that it was impossible for the Western countries and the Soviet Union to coordinate at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Due to the significant easing of Soviet press attacks on Britain and the United States in the past three weeks, the views of all parties have changed. Clay previously announced his intention to use the most powerful propaganda to combat communism and to make the Germans understand the methods of democratic thought and action, and Britain may silently follow suit. However, most British and American observers in Berlin believe that the Soviet Union intends to make some concessions to maintain the unity of Germany and avoid a solid division between East and West. If the East and West are divided, with strong fortifications, the Soviet Union's goal of spreading communism from Germany through the Netherlands and into France will be greatly disadvantaged. An American diplomatic veteran stated, "Dealings with the Soviet Union cannot be short-sighted. The Soviet Union will not give up its gateway to western Germany and the Ruhr area. The iron and steel production of the Ruhr is extremely important to the Soviets, and they are first-class businessmen." There has been a great change in Soviet policy, leading a qualified American political observer to say that it is very possible that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will step down before the London Conference. He admitted that this was an extreme view but warned that this possibility should not be ignored. Even Soviets who have just returned from Moscow feel that there will be surprising developments in the unification of Germany. They insisted that the pessimism of the Western countries is unfounded and that the German issues facing the Four Foreign Ministers can be resolved. Observers in Berlin feel that the Kremlin has decided that the time has come to reach an agreement with the Western Allies. They believe that the Soviet Union is unable to fight and does not want war at present.</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Condemns Soviet Union for Failing to Fulfill Obligations to Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 4th] The State Department yesterday released a booklet accusing the Soviet Union of failing to fulfill its responsibilities in Germany, stating that the Soviet Union's attitude is unwilling to fulfill the agreements reached on various issues at wartime conferences. The Soviet Union has failed to fulfill its responsibilities for disarmament, political construction, and economic unification in Germany and other occupied territories, and only knows how to seize reparations as much as possible.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 3rd] Leaders of the Free Democratic Party in the four occupation zones of Germany issued a declaration after a meeting, demanding that national general elections be held immediately so that a unified German government could be established in accordance with the will of the people.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Polish Troops Crossed the Oder River and Entered Southern Germany</h3>

<h3>British-Soviet Trade Negotiations to Resume</h3>

<h3>Leader of the Polish Peasant Party Describes His Escape</h3>
<p>About to leave England for the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 4th] Mikolajczyk declared here today that he will soon depart for the United States to "visit friends."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 3rd] Polish Peasant Party leader Mikolajczyk met with a reporter from this agency tonight at his wife's residence in suburban London and described the escape in detail. Mikolajczyk said in a painful tone: "When I left Poland, the situation in the country was on the verge of anarchy. In that unfortunate country, the voice of democracy has been stifled, and the call for democracy will not be heard again until a certain foreign force is removed. I first learned on October 18 that my parliamentary privileges were in danger of being revoked, and that two of my friends would also be treated the same and arrested together. I also learned that after being arrested, they would be immediately brought to trial and sentenced to death by hanging on the charge of 'colluding with underground organizations to resist the government.' I knew that if I was executed, my Peasant Party comrades would rise up to retaliate. In order to avoid bloodshed, I decided to escape. It took two days for me and my friends to prepare to escape. I passed through the Soviet occupation zone in western Poland bordering Germany and arrived in the British zone in Germany last Saturday, and then took a Royal Air Force plane to England alone. There is still no definite news about the two friends who left Poland with me at the same time. One is Mr. Kopanski, who was the head of the Warsaw sabotage and civil defense team during the war, and later served as the representative of the Polish government-in-exile in London stationed in Poland; the other is Mr. Brya, who is the economic advisor and treasurer of the Peasant Party of the Polish Bank.</p>

<h3>Former U.S. Ambassador to England, Winant, Dies by Suicide</h3>
<p>[United Press, Concord, New Hampshire, 3rd] Former U.S. Ambassador to England and three-time Governor of New Hampshire, Winant (see photo), shot himself to death on the evening of the 3rd and died. The local lawyer of this district, Pankins, formally determined after examination at 10:30 PM that Winant had committed suicide.</p>
<p>Pankins said: Winant shot himself in the right forehead with a 7.65-grain Belgian-made automatic pistol. The body was wearing casual clothes and lying face down on the bedroom floor. The police found another pistol in the room. In the evening, Winant's personal secretary, Ms. Mei Yu, heard a gunshot in Winant's room and ran to knock on the door with a maid. Winant did not respond, and the two went straight in and found Winant dead. Then Winant's personal secretary and financial advisor, Selen, telegraphed police medical examiner Burt Fei to examine the body. He said that Winant was overly fatigued and nervous, and it happened to be at the time when his "Memoirs of England" was completed, so it must have been suicide. Winant returned home on the evening of the 1st and closed the door. The maid said that Winant had been very distant from people all day and looked extremely tired. Mrs. Winant is currently in New York, and Winant was scheduled to go to New York on the 4th to meet her.</p>
<p>[United Press, Concord, 4th] Former U.S. Ambassador to England, Winant, was stationed in London for a long time during World War II.

In 1947, he was appointed by President Truman as the permanent representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council and requested to resign in December.</p>
<h3>European Countries Resist Totalitarianism; the United States Should Actively Assist</h3>
<p>Assistant Secretary of State Yermo Expresses</p>
<p>[U.S. News Service, Detroit, 3rd] Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Yarmuth today called for countries in the Western Hemisphere to cooperate in helping Europe solve its problems. He warned that the preservation of world peace, freedom, and prosperity depends on whether Western Europe can overcome its current crisis.</p>
<p>Yarmuth strongly argued that a economically and politically sound Europe is essential to the happiness of all countries (including those in the Western Hemisphere) and pointed out that once Europe gains vitality, then "institutions that promote international cooperation and welfare can be effective and generate benefits that all countries and people can share." "He said: "We must take swift and intelligent action to assist the success of Europe's recovery. We cannot delay and sit idly by and watch the problem move to the battlefield or in the manner of the Pearl Harbor incident. The free nations of Europe, although weakened by the last war, are still bravely resisting the invasion of totalitarian countries and striving for our goals. Whether future wars can be avoided depends on their success, and in future wars, the Western Hemisphere is bound to be involved. In addition, the maintenance of our peace, freedom, and prosperity depends on their success."</p>
<p>U.S. Mission to Greece Asks for Increased Aid</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 4th] According to reliable sources, the head of the U.S. Mission to Greece, Griswold, has requested Washington to increase the relief funds for Greece, amounting to 15 million, and the relief plan requires a total of 50 million. The aid to Greece bill will exceed 300 million.

Griswold announced that as of the end of October, 44,361 tons of military equipment have been supplied to the Greek army, including food, ammunition, locomotives, and mechanical equipment.</p>
<h3>United Nations Discusses Korean Issue; U.S. Proposes Revised Proposal Advocating Withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet Troops by Next Summer</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] New York, 4th Broadcast: Lake Success News, today U.S. Representative Dulles made a revised suggestion regarding the Korean issue to the UN Political Committee, advocating the withdrawl of U.S. and Soviet troops from Korea within 90 days, if possible the withdrawal work should occur after the establishment of an independent Korean government.

<h3>According to the Provisions of the Japanese Constitution, Katayama Tetsu Dismisses Hirano</h3>
<p>Internal Division of the Socialist Party Comes to the Surface</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] The Japanese government recently issued a written statement from Prime Minister Katayama stating: because Agriculture Minister Hirano refused the proposal of his own resignation, he had no choice but to exercise the power of dismissal according to the provisions of the constitution, dismissing Agriculture Minister Hirano. Before the successor to the minister is　appointed, the prime minister will tentatively take over. However, although the Hirano issue has come to an end, not only will Hirano himself and the "All Farmers" faction always run counter to the Nishio faction, but House Speaker Matsuoka Komakichi who　also belongs to the moderate faction of the right wing, will also feel angry and uneasy.</p>
<p>The Katayama Cabinet is Precariously Perched</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] Japanese Prime Minister Katayama Tetsu this morning formally announced the dismissal of Agriculture　Minister Hirano, which has caused a political storm, with political parties on the left and right expressing their opposition, the cabinet may be on the verge of collapse. According to Hirano's claim, this move is not in line with democracy, and he will submit it to the Central Committee of the Socialist Party for discussion. Approximately 30 members of the Lower House Farmers' League immediately demanded a decision on whether it violated the constitution, and the Liberal Party and the Communist Party also responded one after another. Only the Democratic Party and others have remained silent.</p>
<p>Other Cabinet Members Will Not Be Affected</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Prime Minister Katayama met with reporters today to discuss the dismissal of Agriculture Minister Hirano and the cabinet reshuffle, saying: the successor to the Agriculture Minister plans to choose a fair and capable person who understands the farmers to fill the position, and will decide within two or three days. The cabinet changes are limited to the Agriculture Minister alone, and will not affect others. He will explain the situation of the Agriculture Minister's issue to the party's cadres and cabinet members from the party, and ask for their understanding. If the members of the party understand the situation, they will surely understand and unite strongly, recognizing that the Socialist Party is the central foundation of this cabinet. The reporter asked: Is there any suspicion that the purge is being used for political purposes? Katayama said: The purge is reviewed by the public officials qualification review committee from a fair standpoint, so it has nothing to do with the government, and it has not been used for political purposes at all. Also, the accusation issue is also accused by the prosecutor's office in accordance with the regulations, so it has nothing to do with politics either. From this point of view, Katayama has indirectly denied the purge of State Minister Lin, and the resignation of Economic Stabilization Director General Wada, and Minister of Education Morito.</p>
<p>Nishio Accuses Hirano of Betraying the Party</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Cabinet Secretary Nishio explained the reasons for the dismissal of the Agriculture Minister on the 4th, saying: The problem with Agriculture Minister Hirano's words and deeds is that he previously said in Nara that the National Assembly should be dissolved and a general election should be held, and on October 15th he said to foreign reporters that the coal mine national management bill would be rejected by the committee, and it would not be passed at the plenary meeting, at that time is　when he will resign altogether. In addition, there are facts of contact with other parties and joint action.</p>

<h3>Large Quantities of Opium Smuggled into Southern China</h3>
<p>The Dutch Government in Java Officially Sells Opium [United Press, Bangkok, 3rd] It was learned today that large quantities of opium are being smuggled from Siam into Malaya and southern China. The value of smuggled opium into Malaya is at least US$1 million per month, with a smaller amount going to China.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 4th] Overseas Chinese merchants who have just returned from Java say that the colonial governments in various parts of the South Seas have not changed their past policies of keeping the people ignorant after the war, the most obvious being the use of narcotics. For example, the Dutch government in Java has adopted an official opium sales policy. Ostensibly, the local government requires drug users to register with the government, but in reality, it is a considerable source of revenue for the colonial government. The general Overseas Chinese community hopes that our government can urge the United Nations to pay attention to this issue.</p>

<h3>The Tragedies and Comedies of War Manufacturers! Stories of Overseas Chinese (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Ninth Letter from Poland · Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing of this Newspaper</p>
<p>According to the account of their neighbor, Mrs. Krukowski (a Polish woman), whom Yin Zuoyu met afterwards, the general situation was as follows:</p>
<p>On the morning of August 20th, several members of the Polish "Revolutionary Army" came to No. 59 Duhu Street to search for weapons and to confiscate the goods stored in the residences of the Overseas Chinese. Yin and Xu argued with them on the basis of reason, and were taken to the command post by the Revolutionary Army. After an interrogation, they were found to have no involvement in any conspiracy and were released. Yin and Xu thought that nothing would happen from then on, and did not take it to heart. Unexpectedly, the very next morning (August 21st), several armed soldiers claiming to be members of the "Polish Revolutionary Army" came to No. 59 again and took Yin Caichi and Xu Xiangui to the garden next door at No. 57. They forced the two men to dig a pit with shovels, then shot them and left after covering them with soil.</p>
<p>Mrs. Krukowski is willing to be a "witness" to this murder. She is willing to testify in any setting. She said that she even tried to stop them a second before the shooting, and was beaten by the "armed" thugs. At that time, Yin Zuoyu was being held by German soldiers and forced to work in Germany. It was not until the Nazis surrendered that he returned to Warsaw. He learned about the injustice from Mrs. Krukowski in the ruins of Warsaw.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Yin Zuoyu exhumed the mass grave at No. 57. "It was tragic! There were two bullet wounds on Caichi's body and six on Xiangui's!"</p>
<p>Yin Zuoyu told me, "The most hateful thing is that the murderer is still an official in the Polish government." He heard this from Mrs. Krukowski. He said, "The embassy has approached the Polish government about punishing the murderer, but there has been no news, as if a yellow crane had flown away!"</p>
<p>Because I left Warsaw in a hurry, I did not interview the details of this matter in detail. Most of the story was told by Yin Zuoyu, with supplements from several other Overseas Chinese. Yin Caichi also had another name, "Yin Baolin," and Xu Xiangui was sometimes written as "Xu Xian." The Overseas Chinese in Poland all know "Baolin" and "Xiangui." They will unanimously say, "They died tragically!"</p>
<p>I also met a "survivor," the hero Qiu Tingjin, who came to Warsaw from Nanbu City in the recovered area of Poland (the area ceded from eastern Germany) to see me. In January 1945, Russian troops rushed into southern Germany. At that time, he and another Overseas Chinese, Chen Lixun, were living in the city of Kraberitz in southern Germany. They were arrested by Russian troops. They spoke German, stating that they were Chinese and that "Allied people should be protected." Because of language barriers, the Russian soldiers ignored them and tore up their passports. They were escorted to the city of Voroshilovsky in Russia, where they were punished with hard labor. In winter, there was ice and snow everywhere, and they were scantily clad and the food was rough, leaving them unable to satisfy their hunger. Chen Lixun froze to death in the "labor camp." Because Qiu Tingjin was strong, he endured all kinds of hardships and escaped from prison.</p>
<p>Qiu Tingjin now has several international friends who have "shared his hardships." He said that in Voroshilovsky, five Frenchmen froze and starved to death, as did six out of seven Czechs, and one out of several Chinese. He could not remember the numbers of Germans and Poles who died. He also said that he often thought of Chen Lixun, and every time he recalled the tragic circumstances of Chen Lixun's death, he could not eat.</p>
<p>The war caused many tragedies for Overseas Chinese, and also created many comedies. There was an Overseas Chinese in a small Polish city who knew some Jews because of his business dealings. Before 1939, Jews controlled the entire economic lifeline: banks, companies, department stores, real estate. All of the larger Polish enterprises were controlled by Jews. In September 1939, Hitler launched a large-scale invasion of Poland. Many Jews were caught off guard and fled in a hurry. That Overseas Chinese, because of his well-known "integrity," accepted a lot of gold, silver, and treasures deposited by Jews, with the understanding that they would be returned after the incident was settled and they would be rewarded. Poland was the place where the Nazis massacred Jews most cruelly. Many of those who "deposited" their valuables disappeared without a trace and died a violent death. It is said that the value of the unclaimed property accepted by that Overseas Chinese was considerable.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the forty-seven Overseas Chinese currently in Poland are not in terrible conditions. There are many agricultural products and cheap food prices, making it relatively easy to make a living. One Overseas Chinese said very frankly, "No matter how difficult the environment is, it is easy to find some money to eat." Therefore, if the government does not arrange a special "Overseas Chinese repatriation ship" to pick them up, they are willing to stay for a few more years.</p>
<p>Most of the Overseas Chinese have married Polish wives and have children. As far as I know, only Ma Tingshen Guangsheng, who is best known for donating money to show patriotism, has a Chinese wife in Poland. Ma Tingshen plans to return to the motherland. He said that as long as he can make money, he will donate half of it to the country. He recognizes very few characters, but he knows very well that "without the protection of the country, individuals, careers, and children are all empty!"</p>
<p>After all, the motherland is still doing its best to protect them. After the embassy was "recovered," Chargé d'Affaires Bao Jinpu and the embassy staff contacted them at any time and solved their difficulties. Generally speaking, the businesses and industries they are currently engaged in are mostly quite profitable, especially the leather industry and the shoe industry.</p>
<p>I visited one of their shoe factories. More than twenty Polish male and female workers, in addition to very simple machines, mostly use handwork. They use canvas and leather to inlay and sew, which the Overseas Chinese old timers taught them. In addition, some Overseas Chinese in Szczecin run hotels. One hotel owner, Zhu Hanting, needs to socialize and interact with others because of running a hotel, and he has a deep "friendship" with the Szczecin Police Department, from the chief to the police officers.</p>
<p>After all, the Chinese are smart. Chinese footprints can be found all over the world. Wherever Chinese footprints have stepped, they will take root, bloom, and bear fruit. I have traveled to Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. Every time I meet those Chinese compatriots who have gone abroad, seeing the careers they have cultivated through hard work and sweat, I feel endless shame and boundless admiration! (End)</p>

<h3>National Flag Fluttering, Whistle Blowing, the Hoshun Returns to the Motherland, Five Agencies Dispatch Personnel to Take Over, Carrying Back a Batch of Books, More Than 8,000 Volumes, and Delivering Four War Criminals, Including the Captain of the Izumo</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the Japanese repatriation ship Hoshun arrived in Shanghai at 4 PM the night before, it was moved to Guangxin Wharf yesterday morning. At 11 AM, representatives from the Shanghai Office of the Representative to Japan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Maritime Administration Bureau, and the Ministry of National Defense jointly took over the ship. The ship has a displacement of 855 tons and has been newly painted. The handover ceremony was completed at 12:15 PM, and the national flag was slowly raised to the sound of a long whistle, which was very solemn. The Hoshun set sail from Shibaura, Tokyo, on the 21st of last month to return to China. Along the way, due to excessive winds and waves, it docked several times. It was not until it reached Kagoshima that it sailed smoothly and headed straight for the motherland. The ship's radio equipment was poor, so it lost contact with Shanghai after leaving Japan, and it did not suddenly arrive in Shanghai until the day before yesterday. In addition to carrying back 33 repatriated Overseas Chinese, more than 8,000 books, and zinc plates for issuing banknotes from the Bank of Taiwan, it also escorted back four Japanese war criminals. The highest-ranking among them was Vice Admiral Kiyoshi Harada, the famous captain of the Izumo warship in the early days of the War of Resistance. The other three criminals were Takeshi Noda, Yoshio Imatoh, and Toshiaki Mukai, all of whom were majors in the Japanese Army. All the criminals lived in the bottom cabin, using military blankets to keep warm, and their lives were very simple. They were closely guarded by the military police on board along the way. They only had their hair cut and took a bath the day before yesterday when they arrived in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>War Criminal Fears Punishment, Expresses Gratitude to China and the United States, Denies Participating in the War</h3>
<p>Kiyoshi Harada is 55 years old this year. He graduated from the Japanese Naval Academy and has served in the Navy for decades. His appearance and demeanor are already showing signs of aging. The reporter immediately asked a repatriated Overseas Chinese translator to conduct an interview as follows: What are your thoughts on the Chinese government and people? Answer: I have nothing but gratitude to the Chinese government; I am especially grateful and admire Chairman Chiang for repaying kindness with kindness. Speaking from my own experience, the Chinese Navy's friendly attitude when taking over Xiamen was beyond my imagination. I am especially grateful. China and Japan must cooperate in the future due to geographical and other reasons. How many years will it take for Japan to recover? Answer: If the United Nations can continue to provide assistance to Japan, then Japan will soon become a very democratic country.</p>
<p>Should Japan's political system be a monarchy or a democracy? Is the Emperor necessary? Answer: Japan has been defeated, so there is no need to say anything else. Japan only has one way out, which is democratization. Also, because Japan has special customs and habits, the people's thinking is centered on the Emperor, so even if democracy is implemented, the Emperor is still needed, and today's Emperor is full of democratic ideas. What is the Japanese people's impression of the United States? Answer: The Japanese people are now learning from the American way of life in every way. Japan has experienced food shortages several times, all relying on American relief, so the general public is very grateful to the United States. Please describe your experience in the war in China. Answer: I did not participate at all. I went to Shanghai in September of the 13th year of the Showa era [1938] and returned to my country in the 14th year [1939]. In the 17th year of Showa [1942], I was dispatched to Xiamen to provide logistical support. "I did not extend a hand to the war." However, my subordinates may have committed evil deeds in Xiamen, but I do not know about it. After receiving a just and upright trial in China this time, I have become increasingly remorseful. The other three criminals all said that they had passed through Shanghai, but did not stay.</p>
<p>After the four criminals arrived in Shanghai, they were transferred to the War Criminals Management Office. The 44 Japanese crew members who came to China with the ship will temporarily stay in the Japanese Prisoners of War Welfare Committee and wait for the ship to return to their country. The repatriated Overseas Chinese will be received by the Shanghai Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and will be dealt with according to their economic situation.</p>

<h3>New Police Bureau Organization: Flying Fortress Team</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The "Flying Fortress" team recently organized by the Police Bureau is tasked with suppressing special incidents (such as strikes, demonstrations, mass disturbances, and bandits). Detection and prevention of major criminal cases. Sudden inspections. Search of special venues. Implementation of emergency orders. Patrol of important areas. Dispatch of special guards.

<h3>Winter Relief Funds to Be Raised According to Target</h3>
<p>Charity Horse Race May Not Be Worth the Loss</p>
<p>Shen Zonglian Laments the Lack of Enthusiastic People</p>
<p>Regarding winter relief matters, the symposium has passed four fundraising methods. The item with the greatest potential income is the charity horse race. However, according to the Jockey Club, the repair costs of the racecourse are very high, and the funds obtained from the charity race may only be enough to cover the repair costs, which will not be worth the loss. If what they say is true, it will affect the implementation of the original plan. However, according to Secretary-General Shen Zonglian of the Municipal Government yesterday, the Municipal Government is determined to do its best to handle the changes and reductions. However, what we are saddened by is that the spirit of service of the city's charitable organizations is inferior to that before the war, and the enthusiasm is also poor. Those with money are more focused on seeking excessive personal enjoyment. For winter relief, regardless of the required funds, we must strive to achieve the predetermined goals. Therefore, even if the horse race becomes a problem, the original relief plan and the required funds will not be affected. It is often heard that 60 to 70 million yuan are spent on banquets and entertainment, but they are hesitant when it comes to relief funds. It should be known that relieving refugees is not only the responsibility of the government, but also the responsibility of the citizens to work together. As for the two shelters for the cold that are planned to be set up, one was originally planned to be in Caohejing, and the other was planned to borrow the site of the former Japanese-owned China Textile Factory, which belongs to the China Textile Spinning Mill. China Textile refused to lend it on the pretext. This was originally enemy property and public property, and it seems that state-owned spinning mills should not have done this.</p>
<h3>Sugar Price Awaiting Negotiation, Sales Delayed by Half a Month</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The eighth round of sugar distribution in this city was originally scheduled to begin on the 11th.

The Social Bureau is scheduled to convene a meeting this afternoon with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation and sugar merchants to discuss the sugar distribution price issue.</p>
<h3>Compensation for Private Ships: Another Trip to the Capital to Request Advance Payment</h3>

Zhong Shandao, the executive director of the Claims Committee, has traveled to the capital several times to request the Executive Yuan to expedite the allocation of funds to facilitate the active preparation of the Resurgence Shipping Company. Now that Director Zhong has returned to Shanghai, he has traveled to the capital several times but has not been able to get what he wanted. Qian Xinzhi, the chairman of the committee, has specifically scheduled to accompany Director Zhong to the capital again on the 5th to request the Executive Yuan to expedite the advance payment.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog Near Tongsha: China Airlines Ship Aground</h3>

<h3>Floating Buoy Drifts Away from Sheshan Waters</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] There was originally a floating buoy in the waters off Sheshan, at the entrance to the Yangtze River, as a marker for entering the mouth of the Yangtze River. Recently, the sea surface has been very windy and the weather has been bad. According to shipping news yesterday, the floating buoy suddenly disappeared, probably swept away by the wind and waves. However, it is very important for ships entering and leaving the port. In addition to reporting to the Customs, it has also notified the captains of all ships to pay attention when entering and leaving the mouth of the Yangtze River to avoid misdirection.</p>
<h3>Enemy and Puppet Houses Must Be Sold by Tender</h3>
<p>Applications to Purchase Will No Longer Be Accepted, Except for Government Agencies and Schools</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the sale of enemy and puppet houses, the Executive Yuan previously formulated measures to expedite the process, stipulating that lane houses could be purchased by the current residents at market prices without being sold by tender, and could be sold separately.

Recently, it was heard that the Executive Yuan has decided to change this regulation, changing it to that except for government agencies and schools that can purchase them directly, everyone else must participate in the bidding. Applications for purchase from current residents have not been approved, and they will all be put up for public tender. The China Trust Bureau is following the Executive Yuan's recent instructions and notifying the current residents who have applied to purchase, stating that applications from residents will no longer be accepted in the future.</p>

The judicial organs should form an independent and complete system. It is proposed to consult the Ministry of Education to include civil and criminal law materials in textbooks for primary and secondary schools in the future.</p>

<h3>The Assassination of Chou Lien-huan: Five Defendants Separately Tried</h3>
<p>Chou's Mother Demands Compensation of 400 Million</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Kao Shih-man, the dance hall inspector Chou Lien-huan, was assassinated by a group of gangsters on June 1st of this year at 1:00 AM in front of the Atlantic Restaurant on Fuzhou Road. The police arrested fourteen individuals, including the main culprit and accomplices like Xiang Yin-quan, and transferred them to the District Procuratorate for investigation. After indictments were filed, the initial trial was held at the District Court on August 9th. The defendants denied committing the crime. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Court No. 9 of the District Court, presided over by Judge Cao Zu, continued the trial of Xiang Yin-quan, Mao Qing-yun, Chen Yong-gui, Bao Yong-fa, and Sheng Shu-gen. First, the witness Wang Ai-xiang testified that she was the fiancée of defendant Ye Dong-ying and the goddaughter of defendant Chen Yong-gui. Ye worked as a ticket collector at the Southern Theater and was</p>
<p>Law-abiding</p>
<p>and would not participate in the assassination of Chou. Subsequently, each defendant was interrogated separately. According to Sheng Shu-gen's testimony, "The main culprit in this case, Feng Ren-yi, disliked Chou Lien-huan because Chou often went to the theater to watch plays for free, which Feng refused. Killing Chou was Feng's plan. On the evening of May 30th, I was having tea at Tongdian Garden when I met Bai Li and Feng Ren-yi, who asked me to go to the bathhouse with them. At that time, Feng said, 'We're going to mess with Chou.' After discussing it, on the evening of June 1st, seven or eight of us encountered Chou at the Atlantic Restaurant. A Jiangbei person went up and hugged Chou, then</p>
<p>Opened Fire</p>
<p>wounding him. I immediately slashed him once. I don't know Wei Xiao-yang and Ye Dong-ying." Subsequently, Xiang Yin-quan testified: "On June 1st, Little Leather Shoes (referring to another culprit's nickname) called me to the hotel. Afterwards, we went to Yipinxiang to have snacks. I went to attack Chou too and was shot by Chou, the bullet entering my back and exiting my chest. Then I slashed him once. Mao Qing-yun also slashed him once. I didn't see if Sheng Shu-gen slashed him." Mao Qing-yun's testimony about the events of that day was slightly different from Xiang's, but he said that killing Chou was Bai Li's idea because Bai's fellow apprentice Zhang Xing-bin was murdered at the beginning of this year, and Chou had ordered it. Bai Li found out and</p>
<p>Took Revenge for Zhang</p>
<p>etc. The other two defendants, Chen Yong-gui and Bao Yong-fa, both vehemently denied killing Chou. At this point, the lawyer hired by Chou's mother submitted an incidental civil suit to the court, demanding compensation for losses of 411 million yuan. The court stated that further investigation was needed and adjourned the trial. The five defendants were remanded to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison. Note that the defendants were originally detained at the District Court Detention Center, but they did not abide by the rules, and they instigated a prisoner hunger strike. Now that their detention period is over, the court, because the trial is not yet concluded, has extended it by three months and transferred them to the Shanghai Prison for detention.</p>
<h3>The Customs Alarm Sounds Loudly: Turns Out Rodents Were the Culprit</h3>

<h3>Interrogation in the Xiao Ling Suicide Case: Leng Shan Released on Bail with a Reliable Surety; Prosecutor Suspects Three Points; Confidential Letter Describes Peculiar Circumstances; Signed "An Unjust Person," Accusing Zhang Chunfan of Murder</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Chen Shou-tao, the prosecutor handling the case of the Yue opera actress Xiao Dan-gui's suicide, held the first court hearing yesterday. The interrogation lasted from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM, resulting in Zhang Chunfan being remanded in custody, Jin Zhao-yuan (Leng Shan) being released on bail, and the other witnesses being dismissed. In addition to Leng Shan, those summoned to testify yesterday included Xiao Ling's sister Qian Qiong-yun, Wu Chen and Liu Tao, directors of the Guotai Yue Opera Troupe, Shen Yi, manager of the Queen Yue Opera Troupe, Chen De-lai, executive director of the Yue Opera Association, and Yue opera actress Yuan Xue-fen. Xiao Ling's brother Qian Bo-chou and Wei Lan-fang were not present. Zhang Chunfan was brought from the Sinan Road Detention Center, wearing a coffee-colored jacket, with a haggard face. Leng Shan wore a woolen suit and glasses. Yuan Xue-fen wore a gray woolen cheongsam with a white velvet jacket and appeared ill. Zhang Chunfan's testimony was the same as his previous confession, but there was one point that the prosecutor paid close attention to: on the 8th of last month, after Zhang and Xiao Dan-gui had an argument, he sought Leng Shan's judgment and said to Leng Shan in the car: "If Xiao Dan-gui wants to commit suicide, you will have to take responsibility." Yesterday, Leng Shan and witness Wu Chen testified, confirming that these words were indeed spoken. This shows that Zhang knew that Xiao had suicidal tendencies but did not take precautions, making him highly suspicious. Furthermore, after Xiao took Lysol and committed suicide on the afternoon of the 13th, she was sent to the Sino-American Hospital by rickshaw instead of a car or ambulance, causing a delay and making rescue impossible. He cannot evade his responsibility for this either. On the afternoon of the 8th, Leng Shan, Wu Chen, Liu Tao, and others went to Xiao Ling's residence and saw torn marks on the lapel of Xiao's coat, proving that Zhang was suspected of abuse. As Leng Shan is the main person of interest in this case, he was also released on bail with a reliable surety. Yuan Xue-fen claimed to be an outsider but said that because Xiao died so tragically, she, as a sworn sister, sought justice from the court. Qian Qiong-yun still claimed that her sister and Zhang had a good relationship and that there were no disputes between them. It is said that the circumstances of this case are already clear, and the investigation will be concluded in the coming days.</p>
<p>The prosecutor received a confidential letter signed "An Unjust Person," which described rather bizarre events, claiming that Zhang was after her money and committed murder. The prosecutor found this too peculiar and will investigate it.</p>
<h3>General Feng Yan's Funeral Today</h3>
<p>General Feng Yan of the Army, Director of the Land and Construction Department of the Ministry of National Defense, passed away at the sanatorium on the 3rd due to overwork. Minister Bai was deeply saddened by Feng's passing and sent General Zhang He-ling, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of National Defense Headquarters, to Shanghai to handle the funeral arrangements.

<h3>Missing Small Airplane Recovered from Communist Area</h3>
<p>Covered in Scars, Under Repair</p>
<p>The personal small airplane of Mr. Durye, the U.S. Vice Consul in Shanghai, has been found in the Communist-occupied area of Jingjiang County in northern Jiangsu Province and recovered by the National Army from the Communists. It has been transported back to Shanghai and is now parked at the Hongqiao Airport. However, the small airplane has been arbitrarily damaged by the Communists and is covered in scars. If the National Army had not recovered it from the Communists early, it would have become scrap. It is now being carefully repaired by the airport mechanics. It is reported that in late October, Mr. Durye took his personal small airplane for a weekend trip at 3:00 PM, but he never returned. There was no news that night. His family was extremely anxious, so the Sino-American Air Force jointly searched by radio, conducting aerial reconnaissance in the surrounding area, but to no avail. The next day, Sunday, Durye returned to Shanghai in the evening, dejected and injured, claiming that his airplane lost control and was forced to land in an unknown area. He was questioned by the Communists for a while and then released, but the airplane was detained. He returned to Shanghai by long-distance bus. Our Air Force continued searching and finally found the airplane in Jingjiang County, which was then recovered by the National Army.</p>

<h3>The Mystery of the 50,000 Yuan Note</h3>
<p>A Conversation with Mr. Yang Xiao-qing, Manager of the Lanzhou Central Bank</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Lanzhou, 1st dispatch] It is rumored outside that 50,000 yuan banknotes are already in circulation in Gansu and Xinjiang, but this is not the case. However, recently, there has been a shortage of funds in the Lanzhou market, and the Central Bank of Lanzhou Branch's bank drafts have reappeared in the market, which is quite inconvenient for the citizens. The reporter interviewed Mr. Yang Xiao-qing, manager of the Central Bank, to inquire about the above phenomena and whether 50,000 yuan banknotes are ready to be issued. According to Mr. Yang, as a rule, when the issuing bureau issues a new banknote, it must first notify all branches and send samples of the new banknote. The bank has not recently received any such notification. By logical deduction, the 50,000 yuan banknote is just a rumor. The reason why the rumor is so prevalent is due to the general shortage of banknotes everywhere, and</p>
<p>The Shortage of Banknotes</p>
<p>is affected by the sharp rise in prices, which has caused an imbalance between goods and currency value. In addition, because the Longhai Railway is blocked, the allocation of banknotes depends on air transport, and the quantity is inevitably limited. The shortage of banknotes in the city is also affected by Xi'an: the purchase of Shaanxi cotton is about 750,000 dan, which, calculated at a market price of 2 million yuan per dan, requires a total of 1.5 trillion yuan. Apart from credit payments and the money that immediately flows back into the market, at least 400 to 500 billion yuan in cash is needed. The sudden influx of this huge amount of cash into the countryside has led to a severe shortage of cash in the Xi'an market.</p>
<p>Premium Phenomenon</p>
<p>has also occurred, and the premium is as high as one-tenth. Therefore, bringing 100 million yuan in cash from Lanzhou to Shaanxi can earn 10 million yuan. The flight between Lanzhou and Shaanxi is only one hour, and passengers can carry 200 million yuan in one suitcase. Therefore, many commercial banks and merchants have been carrying cash to Shaanxi recently, which has led to a shortage of cash in the city. However, this behavior is not illegal, so it cannot be prohibited. However, from an international economic standpoint, it is an unhealthy phenomenon. Mr. Yang also told the reporter that the bank has sent Deputy Manager Zhang Yong-jing to Shanghai to receive and transport banknotes. Before the new banknotes arrive, the bank drafts in circulation in the market are only 400 million and are all old notes, which is just a temporary measure. On October 30th,</p>
<p>30 billion yuan in banknotes were airlifted to Lanzhou from Shanghai.  to 60 billion yuan will be returned, and the city's bargaining chips will not have problems. The premium phenomenon will not occur in the city. In addition, after limiting the loan visits to commercial reserves for public and private banks here, the market has gradually stabilized. However, loans for daily necessities and industrial and mining will continue as before, so there is no possibility of a resurgence of commodity prices in Gansu. (Correspondent Song Lin)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Suppression Launched on the Border of Yu and Cheng Counties</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Changshu, 3rd dispatch] The governments of Yu and Cheng counties have decided to launch a large-scale suppression in the Shazhou District of this county and the Chengyang District of Jiangyin, using the self-defense forces as a base, coordinated with the military police, to ensure the security of the border areas and eliminate banditry. The Yu-Cheng telegraph line will be erected soon, and the Zhijiang Highway will be widened to facilitate defense. In addition, the suppression troops captured a bandit named Fan Qiu-sheng in Shipai. He was handed over to the task force as a guide to identify accomplices. He suddenly took the opportunity to escape in Zhoujing and was shot dead. The township office has reported to the county for verification.</p>
<h3>Tianjin: The Body-in-a-Box Case: Entirely Solved</h3>
<p>(Dispatch from Tianjin, October 31st from our newspaper) Murder cases in Tianjin have been occurring one after another. Recently, a shocking body-in-a-box case happened, which this newspaper has already reported via special dispatch. Now, the full details are as follows: The middle-aged female victim, named Dong Yuzhen (35 years old, from Shandong), was the daughter of Cao Wu's former subordinate, Divisional Commander Dong Zheng-guo. The murderer is her husband, Li Sai-wu, the current manager of Tianjin Zhongtian Pawnshop (courtesy name Yunzhi, 38 years old, from Tianjin). Also implicated is Shi Meili, Li's second wife (27 years old, of mixed Chinese and German descent, who claims to be the niece of Shi En-ji). The case was swiftly solved by the police bureau after the incident.</p>
<p>Starting a New Romance: Constant Arguments Ensue</p>
<p>Li Sai-wu and Dong Yuzhen had been married for 18 years and had two sons and two daughters. The eldest daughter is now 12 years old, and the youngest is a boy, only four years old. Several years ago, Li became acquainted with Shi Meili, and on August 20th of the 34th year of the Republic, they officially married at the Methodist Episcopal Church in Beiping. Dong lived at 120 South Tianjin Road, while Li and Shi now cohabitated at 53 Dali Road in Tianjin. The relationship between Li and Dong deteriorated, and arguments frequently occurred.</p>
<p>Younger Sister Searches for Older Sister: Husband Places Advertisement</p>
<p>On October 25th, Dong Yuzhen went to Li and Shi's cohabitation residence to find Li and was declared missing. Her younger sister, Dong Yuzhi (the third granddaughter-in-law of Cao Kun), searched in many ways but could not find her. Therefore, on the 28th of this month, she personally reported the case to the Police Bureau, requesting a search. On the 29th, she urged Li Yunzhi to place a missing person advertisement in the newspaper. The original text is as follows: "Li Dong Yuzhen, 35 years old (the eldest daughter of the late Commander Huang Zheng-guo), wearing a purplish-red coat, a black silk lined robe, and beige flat-bottomed women's shoes, left 53 Dali Road in the Tenth District by rickshaw at 5 PM on October 25th and has not returned. Searched everywhere with no trace. Anyone knowing her whereabouts, please send a letter. A generous reward is prepared and will not be broken. Sincerely, Li Yunzhi. Address: 53 Dali Road, Tenth District."</p>
<p>Strange Wicker Basket: Entrusted to Friend for Safekeeping</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 26th, Anna, the wife of Rui Le (a Latvian), an employee of the Tianjin United Automobile Repair Factory, suddenly received a German letter from Shi Meili, who was originally a friend. The gist of the letter was that there was a wicker basket that needed to be temporarily stored in Anna's storage room. Soon after, Li Yunzhi and Shi Meili delivered the wicker basket. When Shi Meili was leaving, she said: "The box contains a carpet. If there is a smell, it must be because of the cat's urine and feces." On the 28th, Anna received another letter from Shi Meili, saying that she was planning to take the box away and would add a wooden crate outside.</p>
<p>Alerting the Police for Inspection: Pry Open the Box</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 29th, Li Yunzhi indeed brought a large wooden crate to Anna's place and personally put the wicker basket into the wooden crate. Shang Le thought this strange box seemed suspicious, so on the evening of the 29th, he telephoned the police bureau to send someone to inspect it. Xiao Zhichun, the head of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Police Bureau, personally went and, after arriving at Rui Le's place, pried open the box. As a result, a female corpse was discovered. The head had been cut off and burned, making the face unrecognizable. In addition, both legs had also been cut off. The entire body had been dismembered into four pieces, a truly horrific sight.</p>
<p>The Criminal Pair Confesses the Truth</p>
<p>Based on the address provided by Rui Le, the Criminal Investigation Team quickly surrounded Li and Shi's residence at night and arrested them. Li Yunzhi finally confessed that the corpse was indeed Dong Yuzhen and that he had killed her. According to Li's confession: "Dong Yuzhen came to find me on the 25th, demanding three gold bars, a car, and a diamond, which led to an argument. At the time, she suddenly hit me with an iron head used for repairing cars. Later, it became more and more severe. I snatched the iron head and struck her on the head. At that time, Shi Meili, fearing she would shout, also ran over and held her legs down. Later, we found that she was dead, so we dragged her into the bathroom and washed the blood off her head with water. I temporarily locked her in the bathroom. At 5:00 PM, we pretended to send her away and stood at the door ringing the bell, telling the servant, 'Fifth Madam has returned.'"</p>
<p>Sawing the Body with a Hacksaw</p>
<p>Burning the Head in a Stove</p>
<p>"That night, Shi Meili and I bought a wicker basket and other items. We used a hacksaw to dismember the body and burned the head in the stove. Then, we packed everything into the wicker basket. The next morning, I drove the car myself and sent it to Rui Le's house." Shi Meili did not admit to jointly killing her, but she admitted to participating in the disposal of the corpse.</p>
<p>From the time the case occurred until now, the Huang family has been keeping it a secret from Dong Yuzhen's elderly mother. The four children are still waiting for their mother to return! (Reporter: Li Shao-lin)</p>

<h3>Each County in Jiangsu Province Ordered to Guard Against Underground Bandit Activity</h3>
<p>(Dispatch from Zhenjiang from our newspaper, 3rd) The Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Danyang, Yangzhou, Qingjiang Pacification Command has recently received a telegram from the Capital Garrison Headquarters stating that the area north of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, west to Zhenjiang, and east to Jiangyin is still a Communist bandit underground activity area. It includes the six counties of Wujin, Danyang, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Yangzhou, Jurong, and the Zhenjiang (Xin Lao Zhou) Office, led and responsible by bandit organization minister Chen Yun-ge (concurrently political commissar and secretary) and bandit administrative department director Zhang Zhiqiang (concurrently Chengxi county committee). Each county has a squad of armed forces with one light machine gun. There are also more than ten armed work team members (i.e., short gun squads) who use illegal armed forces to cover up underground work. Recent plans seem to have the intention of developing towards various counties: On the administrative side, strive to win over grassroots Bao-Tian chiefs on our side, coercing with threats and inducements, killing one as a warning to a hundred when necessary. On the economic side, forcibly collect public grain, robbery and kidnapping, extorting firearms and ammunition for ransom, etc. The local command has telegraphed each county to implement strict precautions as a whole.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) The Jingjiang County Government sent a letter to the Zhenjiang County Government stating that over seventy Communist bandits had suddenly appeared in the county's Houhe City, carrying long and short guns and light machine guns, and inspecting residents in the vicinity, collecting all national identification cards, totaling more than one hundred. The bandits then forged the original cards, added photos, to sneak into our defense area to probe military intelligence. It is greatly feared that bandits will use these national identification cards to cross the Yangtze River to the south, so a special letter was sent to notify and ask for attention. The Zhenjiang County Government has already instructed the relevant districts and village offices along the river to take strict precautions as a whole to prevent chaos from arising.</p>

<h3>Wuxi Security Team: Conspiracy Offenders Arrested in Changzhou</h3>
<p>Team Leader Refuses to Yield: Entire Family Dies a Martyr's Death</p>
<p>(Dispatch from Wuxi from our newspaper, 3rd) The Third Squad of the Third Company of the Security Team stationed in Nanfangquan Town, due to the recruitment of soldiers, bandits took the opportunity to sneak in, colluding with soldiers Wu Jun, Zhang Jiguo, Shen Yousong, etc., and launched a conspiracy on the evening of the 28th of last month at about 1:00 AM, taking 28 officers and soldiers of the entire team hostage, forcing them to board bandit ships and flee towards Tai Lake. The next day, except for six soldiers, including Yang Qi, who managed to escape, machine gunner Huang Shaohua was tied up by the bandits and thrown into the center of the lake. Afterwards, County Magistrate Xu sent a team to pursue the bandits on the one hand and sent a telegram to various counties in the Tai Lake border area on the other hand to cooperate in suppressing them. It was not until the afternoon of the first that County Magistrate Xu learned from a telegram from County Magistrate Weng of Wujin that four members of the seized security team had been discovered in the county's territory, and one bandit had been killed. After receiving the telegram, County Magistrate Xu immediately sent Cai Wentong, the deputy commander of the security team, to Changzhou on the 2nd, carrying a document, to bring back Wu Jun, Zhang Liujiu, Di Wenneng, and Zhang Fengchi, the current leader of the Ninth Squad, who had escaped. That night, County Magistrate Xu personally opened the court to interrogate them strictly. According to Zhang Fengchi and others, when the bandit army took the entire team of officers and soldiers hostage in the dark, they were all wearing plain clothes. Among the rebellious team members were Shen Yousong, Zhang Jiguo, Wu Jun, and four newly recruited soldiers (names unknown), who poured into the barracks and took all the officers and soldiers away, forcing them to the lakeside and dividing them into two boats, which were closely watched by the bandits, heading southwest on the lake. On the way, they switched boats at the Zizi port and turned towards Yixing. Near Jiaoshan, the bandits indiscriminately fired on fishing boats, and an old woman on a boat was injured by bullets. Then they encountered a taro boat and indeed obtained a lot of clothing. When the boat arrived at Xiaomei Mountain, the bandits saw that machine gunner Huang Shaohua's attitude was unyielding, so they announced, "Today is your death day." Huang Shaohua was not afraid and replied, "A true man swears to die as a martyr, it doesn't matter." A bandit ordered Huang to stand on the crew's boat, used a piece of cloth to cover his mouth, and pushed him into the lake to die a tragic death. The bandits also, because security squad leader Lu Rongguang was loyal and unyielding, did the same and threw him into the lake, and executed his wife and two sons on the spot. The boat docked at Fenshuidun Bozikou in Yixing County, intending to contact the bandit army lurking in the Wuyi border area. The bandits then held guns and escorted the kidnapped officers and soldiers, traveling through the night, crossing two mountains, and lurking in Shanggao Village on Panjiaqiao in Wujin territory, changing into plain clothes, and secretly holding a meeting at the headman's house to discuss where to go. Then they forced each soldier to burn incense and swear to the heavens with them, and become sworn brothers, expressing unity. At that time, the rebellious bandit Shen Yousong said: "After we become sworn brothers, we will be of one heart, sharing blessings and difficulties." Then a portion of the firearms and ammunition was buried separately underground, and the bandits led a portion of the soldiers and hurried away, contacting bandit forces in Wuxi, Yixing, Liyang, etc., leaving only one bandit named Cheng with one rifle to guard Zhang and the other three squad leaders. The Cheng bandit suddenly planned to go to the village to buy cigarettes, but because his clothes were tattered, he was afraid of attracting attention, so he asked soldier Zhang Liujiu to wear his pants while he tried them on. Seeing that there was an opportunity, Squad Leader Zhang suddenly seized the bandit's gun and fired two shots, killing the Cheng bandit, and then ran to Panjiaqiao Town to report to the town's self-defense force, which went to search and caught the rebellious bandit Wu Hou in the grass on Fenshuidun Mountain, and seized ten rifles, more than twenty bayonets, one machine gun, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Later, the team escorted him to the Wuzhe County Government for interrogation. After County Magistrate Xu learned of this, he rewarded Zhang for his bravery with a commendation of one hundred thousand yuan. Soldiers Zhang Liujiu and Di Wenlong were each rewarded with fifty thousand yuan and ordered to return to their duties. Then, the rebellious bandit Wu was interrogated, but he categorically denied all kinds of conspiracies and cunningly claimed that on the night of the incident, he had gone out to urinate and was kidnapped by bandits and did not participate in the rebellion. County Magistrate Xu, unable to get him to reveal the truth for the time being, ordered him to be put in fetters and detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>A Strange Case in Wujin: Zhao Wenying Assassinated; Two Sons Impersonate Officials and Arrest People</h3>
<p>(Dispatch from Wujin from our newspaper, 3rd) Zhao Wenying, a villager from Zhaojia Village in Dongnanli, Longhutang, North Township, 60 years old, who had served as village chief for more than ten years, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits on September 14th and was found strangled to death in the fields the next morning, in a very tragic state. At the time, it was generally speculated that it was a revenge act by Huanqing, the brother of the bandit Zhou Huanzhang, who had been shot.</p>
<p>Zhao Wenying had two sons, Yongyao and Zhuyao. Yongyao was a cadre in the Youth Corps, and Zhuyao was a soldier outside. Learning of his father's death, he returned to his hometown to handle the affairs and learned that Gu Shoulin, Tang Dasheng, and others were suspected. He successively arrested them and put them in prison along with the criminal police team. He also went to Kunshan to arrest Zhang Chifu. In the latter half of last month, Yongyao and Zhuyao went to Suzhou to arrest Zhang Chifu's son, Zhang Ruijin, and put him in prison, for interrogation by the county government's military law section. The military law section had been unable to resolve the case for a long time. Zhang Chifu's family easily requested the court to summon him for interrogation, but it was not approved. News spread from Zhang Chifu's side that this year Zhao Yongyao was running for county councilor in the village election. At that time, Zhang Chifu was a Bao representative and lost the election by only one vote, holding a deep grudge. It was speculated that he was taking the opportunity to vent his anger. Various public institutions in the locality believed that the feud between the two sides was particularly complicated, and the inside story was not easy to determine and that we can only quietly wait for the public verdict. The Second District Commissioner's Office recently received information about the case and ordered the county government to investigate the case carefully. Recently, the Suzhou City Defense Command received reports on the 30th of last month from local Bao chiefs Chen Bingkui and Huang Zhaohuai, stating: "Zhang Ruijin, a native of Wujin, has been working here this year (as a paper maker) and has not taken any irregular actions. On October 21st at 2:00 PM, three bandits, without any official documents, privately carrying firearms, posing as acting on the orders of the Suzhou City Defense Command, came here and took him away from upstairs with a short gun. After investigation, it was found that Zhao Yongyao, Zhuyao, and a traitorous bandit did it, and also conducted private torture, similar to kidnapping. He is now being sent to the Changzhou County Government. They neither interrogated him nor handed him over to the judiciary for handling. It is hoped that these bandits will be arrested." Upon receiving the report, the Suzhou City Defense Command telegraphed the Changzhou City Defense Command and sent two intelligence officers to Changzhou to request the police bureau to bring Zhang Ruijin, who was in custody, to Suzhou for interrogation. At the same time, they requested the Changzhou City Defense Command to send personnel to assist in arresting Zhao Yongyao and Zhuyao, who had abused the department's name and disrupted public security, and bring them to justice. The City Defense Command immediately approved sending soldiers on the afternoon of that day, together with the police bureau and Bao chiefs under its jurisdiction, to No. 6, Sixth Jia, Tenth Bao, Youzhen, where they arrested Zhuyao on the spot. Yongyao was out and not apprehended, and a telephone switchboard, a telephone set, a receiver, a submachine gun, a quick-release clip, ten bullets, a pistol holster, an American-style revolver, nine bullets, and 55 carbine bullets were found in the room. The personnel immediately placed the seized ammunition in the intelligence office temporarily. Zhao Zhuyao was escorted to the City Defense Command, and Yongyao will continue to be arrested and sent to Suzhou immediately. Yin Zuelie, the secretary of the Youth Library, after hearing the news, visited Li, the director of the City Defense Command, late into the night, and tried his best to vouch for the fact that Zhao Zhuyao, who had been arrested, was a good citizen and claimed that he was a member of the corps and that the firearms he possessed were deposited by the Changzhou Youth Branch. The inspector then said that the matter would have to be reported to the Suzhou City Defense Command, and as of the time of publication, the matter had not yet been resolved.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Encourages Exports and Absorbs Overseas Remittances: New Adjustment of Foreign Exchange Market Prices</h3>
<p>Conditions in Commodity and Financial Markets are Very Stable</p>
<p>(Dispatch from our newspaper) The Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee announced the newly adjusted foreign exchange prices yesterday morning. The US dollar is 59,500 yuan, up 4,500 yuan from the original price of 55,000 yuan; the British pound is 187,000 yuan, up 15,000 yuan from the original price of 172,000 yuan; the Indian rupee is 14,600.65 yuan, up 1,123.64 yuan from the original price of 12,877.01 yuan; the Hong Kong dollar is 11,638.80 yuan, up 933.59 yuan from the original price of 10,705.21 yuan.</p>
<p>The handling fees for designated banks, after consultation and decision, have increased from 700 yuan to 800 yuan for the US dollar, from 2,000 yuan to 2,500 yuan for the British pound, and the handling fee for the Hong Kong dollar is 1,200 yuan. In the past, the designated banks mostly had differences due to their business needs, and generally could not collect the full amount.</p>
<p>According to the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, the current adjustment of foreign exchange is to suit needs and is determined by reference to international forms. At the same time, in order to encourage exports and absorb overseas remittances, adjusting foreign exchange is also necessary. It has no direct impact on general commodity prices. Yesterday, the financial and commodity markets did not fluctuate due to the foreign exchange adjustment, and both showed a downward trend. The reason is that credit is becoming increasingly tight, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance continue to jointly investigate the credit instruments exchange, and the US loan is promising, so the financial situation is quite stable.</p>
<p>Shen Xiduan of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee met with reporters yesterday and said: Recently, US exports have become sluggish again, such as tung oil and pig bristles, whose prices differ from the previous foreign exchange market prices by 10%. It is now the export season again, so this adjustment is purely to encourage exports. As for the foreign exchange revenue and expenditure, it has been able to reach the balance stage so far.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit and Strong Selling Pressure: Chinese Stocks Generally Decline</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were still sluggish yesterday, and small hot stocks also retreated to within the new stock listing price. The investigation of bounced checks caused tight credit, and many closed out and reversed short positions. Although there were low-priced purchases, it was to no avail.</p>
<p>Morning Opening</p>
<p>Only China Cement was highly suspended due to factory absorption, and the rest were low. Yong Yarn opened at 278 yuan and 281 yuan, and then the more it sold, the lower it went. The US dollar price increased, and it began to pull up, but because there were many people selling and the credit was tight, the off-site interest price opened at 1.95 cents and 2.4 cents, and gradually dropped to 271 yuan and 274 yuan. The new shares of Yonggong opened late at 11:11 AM at a price of 140 yuan. Too far from the original price, it immediately fell to the daily limit after opening. Near noon, Yong Yarn retreated to a low price of 266 yuan for immediate delivery and 268.5 yuan for deferred delivery. The morning close was 27 yuan and 270 yuan. Underwear Wuhe suffered the most severe drop, and popular stocks also generally had small losses, only Cement stood at a high level, and cold stocks were just level.</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>The immediate delivery retreated to 269 yuan, and the deferred delivery retreated to 270 yuan. Fortunately, there were low-priced purchases. The Central Bank exchanged a little difference, and it rebounded to 273 yuan for immediate delivery and 275 yuan for deferred delivery. After that, it was thrown lower again, but it did not break into 270 yuan, and the price was 272 yuan and 274 yuan for the market. The bank stocks in the off-site old stocks were still stable, and the cultural stocks and old exchange reaffirmed.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks Fall Together</h3>
<p>Government bonds were still lacking in spirit yesterday. Although 360 Room, 552 Room, and a certain foreign firm came to pay, the supply from 555 Room and 503 Room was more. Unified C opened at 20,000 yuan in the morning, rose slightly to 20,300 yuan, reached a low price of 18,000 yuan, and finally returned to 19,300 yuan at the close. Compared with the previous close, A and B fell by 500 yuan, C fell by 400 yuan, and D and E each fell by 1,000 yuan, and the turnover was still only 4 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks had supply from foreign firms and securities firms yesterday, and Qian Du industry and retail investors had buying. Hong Kong Shanghai Electric rose slightly, and popular stocks were slightly tired in the rotation. Yi Yarn opened in the morning at 186,000 yuan, reached a low price of 181,000 yuan, and finally struggled around 184,000. Compared with the previous close, Kenzi rose slightly, and Xiangtai Telephone each fell by about 10%, and the remaining stocks generally fell slightly.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices First Rose and Then Fell Back; Little Change in Japonica and Indica Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 14,800 dan of rice arrived in both the north and south markets. The market situation first rose and then fell back. As a result, both japonica and indica rice had little change. White silver dollars also had little fluctuation. The supply of flour was still surging, and the factory continued to supply it. People's minds were weak, and it fell back by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Wheat bran was sluggish and fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake customer sales were immobile and fell by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Both soybean oil factories and customers were easing their intake, and the supply line was stagnant.</p>
<p>Green soybeans from Qingdao progressed slightly, temporarily forming a firm structure. Broad beans were very sluggish and tired, falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red beans were stopped by Guangfang and fell sharply by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Red sorghum continued to move in the north, and the price structure stood firm. Corn had movement in the north, raising the price and killing the low. Raw peanuts were connected at both arrival and sale, and there was no breathing. Sesame was the most sluggish and did not fall by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>A large batch of Han Kou oil markets arrived, and people's hearts did not rise. Soybean oil continued to fall by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, sesame oil fell by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, clear oil was fair, and rapeseed oil was firm.</p>
<h3>Headquarters Allotting 200,000 Bales of Raw Cotton Starting Today</h3>
<p>The grading work of 200,000 bales of American cotton has been completed. Registered yarn factories include Taiwan, Guangdong, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other four regions, totaling eighty-four companies. In addition, there are fifty-eight small factories belonging to the Sixth District Textile Association. The allocation method is based on the average allocation method established by the Textile Allocation Committee and the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee. It has been decided to start delivering raw cotton from the 5th. It will be completed within two weeks, and it is stipulated that yarn must be delivered within 25 to 70 days. It is heard that the above-mentioned raw cotton can be exchanged for a total of 160,000 pieces of yarn.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Plans to Form Another Organization to Purchase Materials with Self-Prepared Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau in charge of purchasing materials with self-prepared foreign exchange made an informal discussion and decided to form another organization to be responsible for handling it. The name is tentatively called the Review Committee for Handling Materials Arriving with Self-Prepared Foreign Exchange by the Central Trust Bureau. Whether there will be any modifications in the future will be decided when the organization is formally organized. For the sake of easy execution, the committee will be divided into groups to handle affairs, and it is also tentatively set as five groups: general affairs, finance, storage and transportation, purchase, and handling. Relevant agencies such as the Central Bank, Customs, and the Transportation Management Committee have all been invited to join. The bureau believes that the various measures stipulated in the detailed implementation rules have many difficulties in execution and will have other opinions for approval.</p>
<h3>Temporary Measures First Established for Import of Indian Cotton</h3>
<p>[Dispatch from our newspaper] The Textile Export Committee held a meeting yesterday and decided on the matter of applying for the exchange of yarn and cloth for Indian cotton. Before the factories report and approve their production volume, temporary measures should be established first to allow the import of Indian cotton. After the production volume of each factory is approved, the quantity of export yarn and cloth of each contracting factory will be stipulated. More than 30 yarn factories have now applied to sign contracts, and approximately 50,000 bales of Indian cotton can be imported.</p>
<h3>Banking Circles Issue Funds; Money Market Remains Tight</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday the money market remained tight, with overnight interest at 1.9% per annum. Chinese stock margin loans traded at 2.4% per annum. Interbank lending showed a net outflow of 22.7 billion yuan. The Big Four banks and two bureaus had a net outflow of 3.5 billion yuan. The large clearing house had a net inflow of 11.8 billion yuan, and small clearing houses had a net outflow of 28.3 billion yuan. Foreign banks had a net inflow of 20 billion yuan. The Bank of China used over 50 billion yuan to settle accounts yesterday, resulting in a net outflow of 72.2 billion yuan. The Bank of Communications had a net outflow of 39.7 billion yuan, the Farmers Bank of China had a net outflow of 2 billion yuan, the China Trust Bureau had a net outflow of 11.7 billion yuan, the Postal Remittance and Savings Bureau had a net outflow of 3.6 billion yuan, and cooperative treasuries had a net outflow of 20.2 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Farmers Bank of China Autumn Cocoon Loans; Target Not Met</h3>
<p>The autumn cocoon loan program sponsored by the Farmers Bank of China has ended. As of now, the total amount loaned in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is over 14.8 billion yuan. The total amount of cocoons collected in the two provinces is only 10,466 piculs, including 6,722 piculs in Jiangsu and 3,744 piculs in Zhejiang, which is far from the intended goal. If calculated at the standard conversion rate of 460 cocoons per picul, only about 60 piculs of raw silk can be obtained. According to industry estimates, although this year’s autumn cocoons were affected by the intense autumn sun, reduced moisture in mulberry leaves, active mulberry leafhoppers, and rising rice prices at the time, as well as the fact that farmers could not meet the government-stipulated cost of 1.08 million yuan per picul, some fresh cocoons were sold to manufacturers with their own capital, amounting to about 15,000 piculs. Therefore, although the government’s purchase volume may not reach the intended target, the farmers who obtained funds have benefited and this has invigorated the rural economy.</p>
<h3>Continued Thorough Investigation of Returned Checks; Cash Shortage in the Market</h3>
<p>Measures to Crack Down on Bounced Checks Awaiting Approval for Implementation</p>
<p>Measures to crack down on returned checks have been drafted by the Auditing Office of the National Bank. They will be implemented once approved. The office continues to work with the Ministry of Finance to rigorously audit returned checks in clearing houses. After a detailed analysis of the results of spot checks conducted last Saturday, the office checked the reasons for returned checks with each bank and firm in order to submit a report to the Ministry for instructions. It is expected that the measures will be announced soon. It is also reported that the rule that same-day checks cannot be used is still being strictly enforced.</p>
<p>Further News: After strict management by banks and firms, the number and amount of returned checks have gradually decreased, averaging a reduction of about 20 billion yuan per day. Markets are wary of check transactions, and some stock and commodity firms are trading in cash, which has further tightened the money market. There is a shortage of cash, and premiums are occurring. It is said that a premium of over 1.4 million yuan is required for every 100 million yuan in cash.</p>
<h3>Weak Silk Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Rayon prices are gradually stabilizing. Yesterday morning, Grade 1A traded at 75 million yuan, once quoted over 6 million yuan, but traded at 5.55 million yuan in the afternoon, with asking prices at 6 million yuan. Grade 3A traded at 70 million yuan. Grade 4A was being bought, with prices 3 million yuan higher than the previous day, trading at 61 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spun silk market was slightly weaker and trading was very slow. Asking prices for all grades of five-picul lots were 1 million yuan lower than the previous day. Spot prices were 500,000 yuan lower than the previous day. High-grade spot traded at 62.5 million yuan for seven-day terms, with firms calling for stable prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market was weak, with Da Cheng and Qiang Huo idle market prices falling to 23 million yuan, with six or seven deals. It once reached 3 million yuan outside customs, but in a climate of weakness, it fell steadily, dropping to 620,000 yuan for the next-day term, and then rising to over 700,000 yuan, but finally falling back to 400,000 yuan for Minsk spot and 550,000 yuan for the next-day term, resulting in a decline of 1.3 million yuan compared to the previous day. American goods were 150,000 yuan lower than Wen, Jin Chou Gao goods were 52,000 yuan higher. Other silk goods such as satin were extremely weak.</p>
<h3>Buyers Hesitant; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Blue Phoenix Yarn Down More Than 1.3 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw increasing concerns and care shown for issuing checks by merchants, due to the authorities' thorough investigation of returned checks, which led to an unusually tight money market. There were still many sellers in the market and buyers were hesitant, causing prices to continue to plummet. Later, bargain hunters emerged, and prices rebounded slightly. However, the final price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was as low as 32.3 million yuan, a drop of 1.33 million yuan from the previous day. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 700,000 to 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, although the exchange rate for US dollars increased, there was little impact on prices. Because the investigation of bounced checks had not been clarified and the money market was tight, selling pressure was frequent. As a result, the closing prices of various grades of fine cloth, such as 12-count Nilonglongtou, continued to fall by 8,000 to 24,000 yuan from the previous day. 190 high-grade Shirting remained firm because dye factories did not supply much. The eel-jumping bleached cloth industry was bullish on purchasing, but other bi-colored straight yellow cloth were all weak.</p>
<p>Cash Cotton Lingers</p>
<p>Yesterday's cash cotton market turned bearish again. Yarn factories generally had tight credit and were reluctant to stock up, leading to quiet trading and slightly lower prices. However, because market prices in the producing areas were higher than in Shanghai, cargo owners were not eager to dump goods, so prices hovered with a tendency to spin. 700 bales were transacted. Opening Han fine (cash) was priced at 3.16 million, cotton yarn swap price 3.47 million, Shashi 3.76 million, transacted 300 bales, with the spot price for opening Han fine at 3.323 million. Dongtai 270 bales, Laohokou 3.32 million, Fire Machine 2.5 million, transacted 400 bales, Zhoupu cottonseed 623,000.</p>
<h3>National Economic Conference to Discuss Import Quotas Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Encourage Pulp Imports</p>
<p>[Our Report] The seasonal import quotas have not yet been announced by the Rotation Management Committee. It is reported that the national economic conference to be held in the capital tomorrow will discuss import quotas and may make some changes.</p>
<p>According to the Exporters Management Committee: After investigation, the committee found that some import quotas for various materials, such as industrial raw materials, were not properly allocated. The General Secretariat of the National Economic Conference is studying this. However, it is feared that it will still be difficult to relax the quotas in reality. The only way is to supplement the shortfall from the purchase of self-provided foreign exchange goods on a quarterly basis. Therefore, although the seasonal quotas still need to be considered, they may be announced within the week.</p>
<p>News, “In the fourth quarter quota, the Bai card paper category remains undiminished, and in addition to the quota, foreign exchange head positions can also be raised to import a large amount of the product, to supply paper mills to manufacture.</p>
<h3>Tea Export Trade Expands; Yongxing Absorbs Hundreds of Boxes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea sales in the local streets improved, and morale gradually improved. Exporters and cargo owners are gradually reaching agreement on the export varieties. A total of hundreds of chests from large brands such as Tunxi and Suian were traded in the city, all absorbed by Yongxing Foreign Company and sold by tea companies in Anhui and other provinces. Other tea markets remain stable and quiet.</p>
<h3>Business Briefs</h3>
<p>The Central Bank's Discount and Loan Committee held its 30th meeting yesterday to discuss loan applications that had been reviewed by the 30th Industrial Loan Review Committee and the 14th Export Material Review Committee. As a result, 31 applications were approved, totaling 9.411 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The city's Banking Association recently led the Ministry of Finance to formally abolish the Bank Registration Regulations, the Implementing Rules for the Bank Registration Regulations, and the Ministry of Finance's Measures for Managing Banks.</p>
<p>The central authorities are considering raising deposit interest rates for national banks and bureaus in order to absorb idle capital. It is said that the Central Bank is drafting the relevant measures.</p>
<p>The money market is tight for daily necessities such as soap, and merchants are reluctant to stock up. Cargo owners are eager to sell, and prices have fallen by 2,000 to 5,000 yuan. Matches and candles are stable.</p>
<p>The petroleum market is sluggish. Traders report poor sales. High-grade oil is offered down to 2.9 million yuan for borrowing, and Mobil cans at 390,000.</p>
<h3>Customs Only Stores Excess Foreign Currency Carried by Passengers for Four Weeks</h3>
<p>Unclaimed Currency Will Be Exchanged by the National Bank After the Deadline</p>
<p>According to a statement issued by the Jianghai Customs on the 4th: "Approved by the government, any transit or visiting passengers carrying foreign currency banknotes exceeding the equivalent of US$100 should have the excess portion sealed and stored by the Customs, to be collected upon departure from China. The storage period is uniformly set at four weeks. For foreign currency not claimed after the deadline, the Central Bank may exchange it and issue national currency; if the foreign currency cannot be exchanged, it should also be fully submitted to the Central Bank for safekeeping. After the passenger provides proof of departure, the Central Bank will return the currency."</p>
<h3>The Rebirth of Huainan Coal Mine; Average Daily Output of 2,500 Tons</h3>
<p>The Treasury of Central China</p>
<p>North of the Yangtze River, south of the Huai River, between the Pinghan and Jinpu lines, lies a vast area of wilderness, hiding a rich treasury, which is the Huainan Coal Mine, currently the largest producer in the industry. —Mr. Song Ziwen recently donated all of the Construction Silver Company's investment in the Fourth Plenary Session, one of the main departments—this rich coalfield straddles the three counties of Fengtai, Huaiyuan, and Shouxian in central Anhui, occupying an area of 17 million acres, and contains 100 million tons of black gold—coal—buried underground. If 1.8 million tons are produced annually, the actual mining life will be 40 years.</p>
<p>In this vast plain of central Anhui, in addition to this shining gem, there is also an 88.5-kilometer-long transportation artery, with an average of 1,500 tons of black gold being shipped to Bengbu every day, and then transferred via the Jingpu Railway to Pukou, bestowing this precious gift to the major industrial cities along the Jinghu line. This source of light and heat will continuously surge like a tide from the Huainan coalfield's increased production plan and flow into various regions.</p>
<p>Emerging Productivity</p>
<p>There are currently three mining areas in the Huainan Coal Mine. The first mining area is the Datong Coal Mine before the war, which is an old cadre with the highest output and strong strength. The second and third mining areas are the east and west coal mines, a pair of offspring of old Huainan. The total output of these three production units averages 2,500 tons per day. After decades of excavation, the coal deposits between 100 and 180 meters underground have been gradually hollowed out. Now the mine is opening new battlefields, opening three new wells from 240 to 330 meters deep as a reserve force for production.</p>
<p>Opening new wells is a difficult and great project in mining engineering. Starting from the ground, passing through the strata for more than a thousand feet, and digging such a large well hole with a diameter of six meters, after excavation, temporary well stones and cement are used to build it from beginning to end, and then drainage iron pipes and driving steel rails are installed. In the future, the underground "black gold" will be loaded car by car into a coal cage like a sedan chair and lifted out by an electric winch, similar to the scene of opening an elevator in Shanghai's International Hotel.</p>
<p>When the reporter visited the well, looking down from the entrance, I saw only a dark bottomless pit with its mouth wide open, and a sound of metal collisions was transmitted from the bottom of the well. Barrels of mud and rocks were lifted out of the bottom of the well, and the workers sat in these barrels and swallowed from the well opening. Such a huge and magical project, I don't know how much manpower and financial resources it costs!</p>
<p>The No. 3 well of the first mine, after a year of hard work, has been completed. Now, a reinforced concrete well building and derrick are being built on the ground, and an electric winch with 1,000 horsepower purchased from "Xing Zhong" is being installed. It is estimated that this new force can join the battle at the beginning of next year. The power to lift 3,000 tons of "black gold" per day will exceed all the old cadres. In addition, the No. 7 well and the new No. 3 well of the second mine are also being stepped up. It is expected that they will be completed one after another in the next few years. Their output is also 2,000 to 3,000 tons a day. This group of young and strong emerging reserve forces will add new vitality to the Huainan Coal Mine, and the entire Central China industrial zone will also obtain more abundant fuel.</p>
<p>A New Gem</p>
<p>A new gem has recently been discovered 25 kilometers northwest of the old mining area, at the foot of Bagong Mountain in Fengtai County. The Huainan Coal Mine Bureau and the geological exploration team of the Resources Committee spent more than half a year conducting exploration work there. Drilling hundreds of meters underground with iron pipes of various sizes, and drilling fourteen holes at different positions, it was confirmed that under the ground extending 7.5 kilometers, there are 19 coal seams, a total of 30 cubic meters thick, with 40,000 cubic tons of "black gold" reserves. If 10,000 tons are mined every day, the brilliance of this gemstone will shine for a century.</p>
<p>This new coalfield not only has rich reserves and good coal quality, but also has a geological structure that is very easy to mine. The inclination of the coal seam (160 degrees) is very gentle and close to the ground. After detailed research and discussion by all the engineering staff, it was decided to mine coal from the ground through inclined shafts, and prepare to use various new coal mining machines. For example, installing a coal conveyor belt in the well to replace the traction of horses and the carrying of manpower, and using a coal cutting machine to replace manual excavation. This mechanized coal mining method has long been used in the UK and the United States, with high efficiency and large output. The deaths and injuries of miners and labor can also be greatly reduced. People who have not been down a well in person can never imagine how difficult the lives of miners underground are.</p>
<p>The exploitation plan for the Bagong Mountain new mine has already begun to be implemented, and is divided into three phases. Each phase will open a pair of inclined shafts 220 meters long as channels for transporting coal. In the future, a large pile of "black gold" loaded with a coal conveyor belt will automatically roll out on the track bed. These new machines have already been ordered from abroad. If they can be delivered on schedule, this new treasure house will hang 2,600 tons of "black gold" every day, which can be increased to 6,000 tons in the next two years. This congenitally strong newborn will lay a far-reaching future for the Zhunnan Coal Mine and shine brightly in the wilderness of central Anhui. (Special reporter Wang Qi from Huainan)</p>

<h3>Picture Gallery Bridge</h3>
<p>—Hong Weifa</p>
<p>Dreaming of Yangzhou Continued 24</p>
<p>The childhood playground of my hometown. As I get older, I must have a lot of memories when I pass by it occasionally. Sometimes, in order to avoid feeling emotional, I will detour. For example, the Tutie Gallery Bridge in my hometown of Yangzhou, although it is the main route between the old and new cities, I am not very willing to pass there. The bridge is named after the picture gallery because it is close to the picture gallery. However, there is no picture gallery near the bridge now. Middle-aged people can still know the old site, but young people have difficulty finding any memories in their memories.</p>
<p>The bridge is directly opposite the current Fifth District Commissioner's Office. The current Commissioner's Office was the Bureau of Education before the war. Before the Bureau of Education was the Bureau of Encouragement of Learning. Before the Bureau of Encouragement of Learning was the library. Tang Yinchen of Hubei, Guang Sheng, wrote in "Guangling Private Ride": "Jiang Yishuang, Zi Shaodi, originally named Pengling, was a tribute student from Ganquan. When he was young, he did not restrain himself and liked to hang out with prostitutes, and he could barely protect his nose. However, he was enthusiastic about new learning and was brave in taking responsibility. When he was a magistrate, he founded the Huaying Commune, planned to establish a local higher primary school, built a public country, built a library, and built a bridge for people to pass through. Although the expenses did not necessarily come entirely from him, he was able to seek public welfare in the dark and stagnant times in order to open up, and he cannot be said to be a man of his time." Chen Maosen, Siqing, editor-in-chief of "Jiangdu County New Records" also said that he "founded the Kuangshi Society in Yangzhou in the Guangxu period and communicated with Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao remotely. When Kang and Liang's power failed, the society stopped, but the ambition to promote education did not diminish. Yangzhou Prefecture Middle School and Jianggan Primary School are managed and promoted. He took it as his responsibility to open up the people's wisdom and organized the Huaying Commune to obtain Chinese and Western books and allow people to buy and read them,输新智识於民衆, scholars have benefited deeply. He also established a private school to improve the training, the Jianggan Autonomous Branch, and built a library in the ruins of the old city, and raised funds to build a park south of the library. The achievements were remarkable, and his reputation became more prominent, so he was appointed as the director of the Ganquan Bureau of Encouragement of Learning, and he was able to fulfill his long-cherished wish to promote education." From this, it can be seen that today's library bridge is named because it was close to the Guan Library in the past, and this bridge and the library park were all created by Jiang Guangsheng. When Jiang created and renovated this bridge, library, park, etc., and served as the director of the Bureau of Visual Learning, he was highly praised by the people of the city. For example, a celebrity wrote "Ten Strange Little Tunes of Yangzhou," and the fifth song used Jiang as the object of attack. As he said: "The fifth strangeness, strange, the Guan Nose unexpectedly entered the academic world! Two years of visual learning, good at scheming, ten years of hall, even more serious, holding public welfare skills, collaborating with officials, talents are not bad." And said: "The chief supervisor of the prefectural high school, earned three thousand foreign dollars; the building is built high on the city head, and the books are set up for business." Such sarcasm almost made the person in charge feel ashamed. However, every time I pass the Tutie Gallery Bridge, the old things of my childhood are gathered in my mind, and I still admire Mr. Jiang's achievements, because when I miss the old things, he still did some public welfare things for the local area, and there are some performances that seem to be more than just an object of sarcasm.</p>
<p>Speaking of old childhood things, the old site of the library, until it was changed to the most recent Commissioner's Office, the most different thing I felt was that the number of people coming in and out decreased with time. Because in the library era, anyone could come in and out, in the era of the Bureau of Encouragement of Learning and the Bureau of Education, those who came in and out were limited, and in the era of the Commissioner's Office, there were even more restrictions. However, in the era of the Bureau of Encouragement of Learning and the Bureau of Education, there was still a high mound behind the house, which was the relic after the demolition of the old city wall, which is what the New Records calls "the ruins of the old city." When I was a child, I often went up to see it with my little friends, and I could get a rough idea of the layout of the houses of the Bureau of Encouragement of Learning or the Bureau of Education, as well as the activities of the staff. From the beginning, the mound was surrounded by bamboo and rattan, and it was impossible to go up again. However, every time I passed by, I could see the mound. Although I missed the old things, I was still comforted by the fact that it was better than nothing. Unexpectedly, today, the mound has been flattened again, and it has all become a building. So, when I pass by, I miss the lost mound again!</p>
<p>The New Records said that Mr. Jiang would "raise funds to build a park, which is south of the library," which is only a short distance away. When the park was first completed, I remember that it still had the beauty of pavilions, which could be used for sightseeing. Although it was identified as "Park Teahouse" because there were too many teahouses in it, at that time, the Inner City River could still barely travel cruise ships. Tourists could board ships from the park pier close to the library bridge and leave the city from Xishui Pass to visit the Slender West Lake. When the cruise ship was traveling on the Inner City River, passing through bridge holes, the green shade was reflected on both sides of the river, and many families along the river were leaning on the windows to watch, which often reminded people of Du Mu's poem: "The spring breeze ten miles Yangzhou Road, rolling up the pearl curtain is not as good." By the time they returned to the city at dusk, passing through the bridge holes, the moonlight shone on the water, and the water waves rippled with the shadows of trees, people, and boats, which often reminded people of Du Mu's poem: "The bright moon night of the Twenty-Four Bridges, where does the jade person teach to blow the Xiao." Although the Library Bridge still exists, the public picture pier has long been gone, and most of the park has been occupied by the Tax Bureau. The remaining very small part is said to be a teahouse, but it is dilapidated and desolate. In addition, the so-called Inner City River has also become a small ditch, and the two banks are exclusively occupied by garbage, without the green shade. Of course, Xishui Pass was temporarily blocked for defense reasons, and even if it is still open, how can the cruise ship enter again? - These are all old things that I thought of because of the Tutie Gallery Bridge. I was afraid of increasing the burden of memories in my mind, so I detoured and did not want to pass there, which was really a last resort!</p>
<h3>Confession</h3>
<p>— Qing Guo</p>
<p>Stars – Speaking to the Children Who Love Stars</p>
<p>Do you want me to talk about my memories? My memories are lonely yet bright.</p>
<p>Children, you are all such dreamers. Your dreams grow a pair of transparent wings, and at night, they fly towards the high, clear blue sky.</p>
<p>And I, once used the stars to nail the glittering golden days carried on my wings, one by one, to the high blue sky.</p>
<p>However, the air currents in the sky gradually weakened, and the seasonal winds and rains gradually became violent. Although my wounded wings struggled to bear the hardship of life and the heavy weight of hope, I was unable to fly. I often fell from the edge of nightmares, the rapid beating of my heart counting the heavy steps of sleepless nights.</p>
<p>Guarding the still night, I often look up at the dense stars, the stars that nail my lonely and bright memories.</p>
<p>Beneath those few red and large stars lies my hometown. Ten years ago, my old grandmother pointed to them and told me many beautiful stories. And in my dreams, I transformed into characters in the stories, as happy as swimming in a boundless sea, I walked in a garden of large blue stars.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have a heart that loves loneliness, a soul that loves lonely nights.</p>
<p>A large pile of glittering golden childhood days were nailed to the blue sky one by one using stars.</p>
<p>Children, you children with watery eyes, don't just keep asking about my memories! When you unfurl the wings of dreams and paddle towards a sea-like expanse, writing countless stories in the blue sky, what will you then understand? Isn't it true that stars are also lonely yet bright?</p>
<p>And now, the night is deep, and the time for dreaming will not last much longer; the time for the stars to fall has come; we should joyfully cast off our memories. Isn't it so?</p>
<p>"One… I think about it</p>
<p>Falling in the cold night</p>
<p>Is not a destroyed life</p>
<p>But a seed of light!"</p>
<p>— Second: A Seed —</p>
<p>So, let us talk about tomorrow, let us talk about future lives.</p>
<p>Rain</p>
<p>I love the rain.</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, I was very fond of my grandfather's black oilcloth umbrella, and I sometimes fondly played with my two uncles' and two aunts' red paper umbrellas. Every night, those umbrellas were neatly placed in my dreams, and I would open them up and run through the fields, through the meadows, through the streets, towards groups and groups of children, where I received many envious and respectful glances.</p>
<p>However, it was ultimately a dream, and disappointment tightly gripped my heart after waking up.</p>
<p>The adults said: Children cannot hold up an umbrella when the weather is clear, for if they do, they will not grow tall and will become dwarves. And so I was tightly bound by this fear.</p>
<p>I could only think of rainy days, for on rainy days, I could hold up an umbrella without reservation. But rain did not fall often, and my childhood passed in a mostly plain and ordinary way.</p>
<p>It was not until today that I walked on a field fully woven with rain threads.</p>
<p>But I am still a child, and I still cannot get an umbrella. My grandfather's black oilcloth umbrella was destroyed before he died, and my uncles' and aunts' red paper umbrellas were thrown who knows where.</p>
<p>Now is the rainy season, a rainy society, and I think of how my life will have to struggle in a muddy, dragged-out manner!</p>
<p>I do not want to dream, I know that dreams cannot mend my hopes; I do not need an umbrella, I fear that the umbrella will cut off my intimate connection with the rain.</p>
<p>I would rather forever be a child, dedicating my whole sincere, pure love to the rain of our humanity.</p>
<p>The rain is moistening the days, moistening the land;</p>
<p>The rain is moistening my heart.</p>
<p>The rain is moistening my heart. The rain is beating on my desolate, parched heart!</p>
<p>On rainy days, I want to walk on muddy roads. Let the rain above my head and the mud beneath my feet gather on my body and bloom into one, two, thousands of silver-bright rain flowers, golden mud flowers.</p>
<p>Then, with a smile, I happily whistle, knocking on each and every closed window in turn.</p>
<p>Drunkenness - For the Worried</p>
<p>Are you most afraid of thought? Thought is a winding, deep stream. Following this stream, you can often discover many roses floating on the surface of the water, which are the remnants of past joys and hopes, destroyed, and left behind. Indeed, the past is falling one or two at a time in the wind and rain of dreams and shadows.</p>
<p>There is no way, only to pick up one's own pain and then unfold it again. However, I will not hide from you that I have long seen sorrow following behind you, he sneers at you, staring at you with two gray-black eyes.</p>
<p>The good dreams you once kept in your pillow? Shattered, right? You can blame yourself for pressing your head too heavily on them. Who told you to store so many thoughts in your head?</p>
<p>Tell me, is your hearing still sound? Endless sorrow, carrying a kind of low and trembling sound wave, leaks into the vast space, and falls onto the soil of the soul. You hear it, right? Has there been any echo in the valley of your heart?</p>
<p>Good, today is your birthday, please forgive me, I have rambled on and on about some things that have made you uneasy; now, here is a cup of bitter wine, drink it, I bless you! Do not be afraid, do not hesitate, raise it, it is only a cup of bitter wine mixed with the taste of life; it has no poison, and naturally no fragrance or sweetness.</p>
<p>Hurry! I have urged you a second time! You have opened your mouth, why is your voice so small?</p>
<p>——I have done it! I am drunk! I have long been drunk!</p>
<p>You are drunk? What an interesting sentence this is! Like a gossamer thread, it leads into the cold and boundless night.</p>
<p>Then, lie down!</p>
<p>Yes, you are truly drunk, you have truly long been drunk.</p>
<p>Lie down well! Let the quiet window watch you, let the red lamplight rock you,</p>
<p>Let the kind autumn rain gently sing a lullaby for you.</p>
<p>When dawn breaks tomorrow, we will climb the mountain together to see the newborn sun.</p>
<h3>Recent Poems from the Art Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Shi Shufan</p>
<p>Answering You, Junzuo, of Lanzhou</p>
<p>West of Yumenguan, the wilderness is broad, an old friend changes customs at the tip of the brush. Though dressed in plain clothes, he still opens up the world, autumn dreams often lead to entering the He Pass! New Year's greetings are delayed by letters in the shifting sands, [We] look at the Qinghai lake under the moonlight. Border crimes are already a worry, what can be done? We still rely on sincere words to move the heart.</p>
<p>Sanmu, Bai Jiao, and Xie Taixuan, two talented scholars, honored [me] with a visit, and we drank heartily at the Art Pavilion until late into the night.</p>
<p>South of the Yangtze, wild men are busy with Yan's affairs, we meet suddenly with joy and purchase a drunken spree. Old, how could we ever forget the Wei and Jin dynasties, unspeakable, we can only entrust to Yin and Yang; the moon shines above the pavilion, the path of the world is long under the lights outside the door. Soldiers hurry down, sending back the white hairs, [I] can not bear the coolness.</p>
<h3>Autumn Listening Painting</h3>
<p>— Ma Gongyu</p>
<h3>Sixteen Years</h3>
<p>— He Yifang</p>
<p>Children of the Motherland! Can you hear? Ah! Mount Tai is groaning, the Songhua River is sobbing, the invaders' devilish hands are strangling the throat of the Continent! Eight years of hardship and endurance, you have not shed a single tear, but I hear your souls in pain, I see your hearts burning. Songs of victory take flight, you, daughters of the Motherland! Once laughed wildly, but now have changed to sighs, more tragic than crying! Now, I can't write a beautiful poem of astonishment,</p>
<p>Sixteen years, this string of days without sun, (on the night of the sixteenth September 18th Incident)</p>
<h3>Sartre on Existentialism</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Existentialism was proposed a century ago by the Danish philosopher Kierkegoard. He opposed the Christian claim that we are all sinners of God. This long-legged man prepared his theory, ignoring the opposition of his contemporaries, and the sins of battle made his philosophy the central idea of Europe. His doctrine is combined with Emerson's "Self-Reliance."</p>
<p>However, no matter how Sartre tried to avoid people's curses, his existentialism is ultimately a philosophy of disappointment. His own dramas are also full of disappointed and violent characters, who are often anxious because of their failed struggles, constantly berating their lack of rescue. This lecture "Existentialism" was given in Paris in 1945 and has only been translated into English this year. Sartre says that his philosophy is truly the practice of "self-confidence", but the characters in his creations cannot confirm what he says. He introduces Kierkegaard's trembling before the "finite," and before the terrifying "infinite" God, this is "an anxiety that everyone can feel." Sartre says that this is the world of man, and no one can find a way for him. Swimmers are drowning in this mysterious sea, painfully reaching their arms out of the water, crying out for help, but the result is just an empty show.</p>
<p>Sartre believes that confronting "forces invisible to man" must be done within the "finite" subjective realm of humanity itself. Does he feel that industrial society has turned him into something without meaning? Is he groping helplessly in the dark? Sartre says: Very well, my good man, liberate yourself. This is very easy. "Man is nothing, he is made by himself. You can be free, choose, and that is creation."</p>
<p>Sartre is not a philosopher in a library, he has seen the life of the lowest levels of the basements of Paris. His life is in motion, not still. He believes that "truth" is not easily understood unless it is combined with "mind" or "personal experience of existence." Man is a passionate and enduring being, not a purely rational, inhuman tool. He does not develop into Christian existentialism, but prefers to remain among men, and this is where he differs from Kierkegaard.</p>
<p>"I think, the "truth" of the "man" can not be removed; therefore, I exist." Sartre's speech is a brave attempt to rebuild human freedom and dignity without relying on God.</p>
<p>The above is a commentary by Olivr Barres in the Saturday Literary Review. Barres is a student at Yale Divinity School.</p>
<p>For the sake of supplementation, I will introduce the explanation of existentialism in the "Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature" as a supplement. "The starting point is that "truth" is meaningless unless it is for the "heart." Existentialists say that this does not mean, as idealism does, that all "truth" is in the "heart." The "outside world" still exists. In fact, "human truth" is a centrifugal force, endlessly leading to material things. Do not lose self-confidence, become a complete individuality. According to Sartre, logically, this is a contradiction. Therefore, human existence must lead to lack, emptiness, and failure. It is because of this imperfection that we are able to be free, and our freedom itself is nothingness."</p>
<p>Probably Sartre wanted to "conquer nature", struggling hard, but in the end, he still could not escape the "death" barrier, and the "finite" finally succumbed to the "infinite", so in the end, he only failed.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"That's good." I nodded in agreement with his argument: "But I remember you just said that you and our army in the Nankou area exchanged messages; and that the night attack tonight will be led by you and Hucheng personally on the left flank of the front line, using machine guns to send signals. I have some doubts - do you think this can be done?"</p>
<p>"I can answer these two questions separately," Yaoqun narrowed those – rebuilt – peaks: "First, regarding our side's communication with the defending army at Nankou, that is a fact; later I can let Xudi report all those things to the master. Second, regarding using machine guns as signals, we already experimented last night, and also received a reply from the Ning side: the method is 'three two...three two...continuous burst...'"</p>
<p>"Wait, as far as I know, the Japanese army's military orders are extraordinarily strict; it can almost be said that every infantryman firing a bullet should have a basis in the orders. What I mean is, I don't know how you can run into the Japanese army's firing line? That's one point. Second, let's say you can pass through many checkpoints to the front line, assuming there are no orders from anyone, what method will you use to use the machine gun? Maybe..."</p>
<p>"I understand what you mean." Yaoqun answered, interrupting: "On this point, I just need to explain one thing. You probably don't know what role I'm playing in this area. If you knew that I was a veteran assistant of a spy among the enemy bandits, you would probably understand all this."</p>
<p>Hearing this, I seemed to realize something: "This veteran spy is probably Mai Shafu! But..."</p>
<p>"But what ability does he have to rush straight up and down on the front lines of the Japanese army, right?" Yaoqun explained my question for me; then smiled with a "chih"; I'll tell you, whether he's talking nonsense or not, I dare not say; but in fact, it proves that he has a special power that allows him to come and go freely in the Japanese army; not only can he do this, but he can also bring me back to the base, drilling around on the front lines of the Japanese army without any problems..."</p>
<p>"Then?... " I wanted to ask Yaoqun about firing the gun at will.</p>
<p>"Please listen!" Yaoqun did not let me interrupt; "Her style is a bit crazy... I saw with my own eyes that he took a pistol from a small Japanese headman on the front line, and just fired three shots "pa pa pa" at random; then threw the gun back to the small headman, nodded and said: "Very good!" Saying this, he just walked away. This is not surprising. The strangest thing is that the little Japanese devil, after receiving the gun she threw back, said "thank you" all over his mouth, and even bowed..."</p>
<p>"Hum, strange!" I really felt surprised. Because as far as I know, there has never been this rule in the Japanese army. Behaviors like Mai Shafu's, so presumptuous and reckless, seem to be something that even the senior Japanese officers cannot do. If it were outside the battle lines, there might be half a chance.</p>
<p>"I also feel inexplicable." Yaoqun said, with an attitude of suspicion also appearing on his face; as if he was recalling something: "However, all of this is the truth. So, it is completely believable that tonight, this guy Mai Shafu will lead us to the Japanese front line to deliver messages with machine guns..."</p>

<h3>Meddling in Other People's Business</h3>
<p>— Zhu Mei</p>
<p>In the summer of the twenty-first year of the Republic, I was on vacation in ChateaurThiery, France. Lingdu Nenli is a city in the Malai River basin. Because the water flow is too rapid, they have constructed an artificial canal behind the city to disperse the water force. The water in this canal is very clear, and there are many fish, and they are all big fish. I usually like to fish, so I bought a fishing rod to fish. Just as I cast the fishing line into the water, a person on the opposite bank came out to interfere with me, saying that fishing was not allowed in this place. I took a closer look and saw that he was a farmer tilling the land. At that time, I was a little strange. The river is public, so why is fishing not allowed? I asked him the reason, and he said that there were laws and regulations that did not allow it. After hearing this, I immediately packed up my fishing rod and returned in disappointment. In the evening, I asked the landlord the reason why fishing was not allowed in the canal, and he said that this was a law promulgated by the city of Lingdu. At the same time, he told me that there was a fishing association for fishing here, and a bird-shooting association for shooting birds. Fishing also has designated places and certain times (fishing is not allowed before the sun rises in the morning and after the sun sets in the afternoon). Bird shooting is the same, with seasons and designated places. You cannot go shooting at will. This impression and conversation have remained unforgettable to this day, for two reasons: First, foreigners like to meddle in other people's business, which is different from the way we Chinese think. Chinese people never ask about anything that has nothing to do with them. They are purely individualistic. The highest ideal is to take care of themselves. It doesn't matter to them whether other people are good or bad. Westerners, on the other hand, applaud when you are good and oppose you when you are bad. Therefore, in our country, despite the strict laws and numerous police, people still do bad things as usual. It is not that foreigners do not do bad things, but that they do not think that everything is taken care of with the police. Instead, they immediately interfere with anything they see as unreasonable. It is like that farmer, he is neither a police officer nor a judge, but he is a good citizen. He interferes with anything he sees as unreasonable. The public morality of the Chinese people is built on two sayings: "Sweep the snow in front of your own door and don't care about the tiles on other people's roofs." For example, on a road, the neighbor's doorstep is piled with garbage and smells bad. Ordinary people will just curse a few words in their hearts and will never step forward to interfere. I think this meddling can be done, because a road is clean, but if your house has garbage, we will definitely ask you to clean it up. The biggest reason is that it is a small matter to stink your neighbor to death, but it is a big matter to keep the street clean. This is also the case with the Republic of China. It is ours, the government is ours, and we must take care of everything that affects our people, no matter how big or small. We report corrupt officials because they are our public servants. What could be more despicable and degenerate than not reporting them but instead sending them gifts? Second, our people are disorganized in everything and look down on organization. If you tell him to have an association for fishing, he will definitely scold you for being bored, because only with organization in everything can we collectively study, make progress, and have strength. We must understand that there is absolutely no nation in the world that can exist with each acting for themselves. Isn't the historical lesson of China for thousands of years enough?</p>
<p>Today, I am advocating meddling in other people's business, but the condition is that it is meddling in business that concerns everyone, not meddling in one person's business. (October 29, Qingdao)</p>
<h3>The Problem of Time</h3>
<p>— Fang Ren</p>
<p>The Chinese people have always embraced the principle of "almost" when dealing with everything, and their concept of time is particularly weak. If a meeting is scheduled for 9:00 AM, it is extremely rare for it to start exactly at 9:00 AM. Even whether it can start at 10:00 or 11:00 is not certain. Therefore, people who keep their time are greatly taken advantage of.</p>
<p>Especially in recent years, there have been many changes in time. For example, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the rear areas used the Longliu District time, which was as much as an hour behind the local time. Therefore, the clocks of the agencies and the people were often inconsistent, and any announcements had to be annotated with the time below.</p>
<p>Also, starting on the first day of this month, the government issued an order to abolish daylight saving time and turn the clocks back one hour. This matter was originally very simple, but after people asked about it and wanted to add an explanation, it often became more and more confusing.</p>
<p>My child studies in elementary school and returned the day before yesterday and said: The teacher called us to go to school one hour earlier from tomorrow. I casually agreed, and turned the clock back one hour in the evening. The next morning, the child took a look and saw that it was only 8:00, and said that it was still early. He didn't know that the clock had been turned back, and the time was still the same. But he could no longer understand what was going on.</p>
<p>Looking at the advertisements for movie theaters in today's newspaper, most of them have specially added notes about restoring ordinary time; with distinctions such as "old time", "winter time", and "standard time". In fact, if these notes are examined closely, they all have grammatical errors, and they are becoming more and more confusing as they are annotated.</p>
<p>In fact, since the world already has the regulation of Greenwich Standard Time, international events can be annotated with this time, but for ordinary applications, local time should be used. Because the area of our country is vast, time zones are difficult to unify; even for saving daylight, we can advance the clock, but there is no need to turn the clock so often, which would only lead to inconsistencies or other malpractices due to time calculation errors.</p>
<h3>Emotional Storm</h3>
<p>— Lyon</p>
<p>Impressions of "New Desire Flame"</p>
<p>After seeing "New Desire Wave," it was nearly midnight when I returned home. My heart was filled with complex passions, and my eyes overflowed with tears that were not shed because they were washed away by a poem.</p>
<p>I sat at my desk with my head bowed, and unintentionally exhaled a puff of smoke. That simple narrative; unfolded an impression in my mind: —</p>
<p>Like a clear stream, it flows slowly. Occasionally, it hits a small stone, and the stream meanders into two streams, and then they naturally converge; they converge so smoothly.</p>
<p>This is a desolate night song, which is sad enough; however, what fascinates me more is that human touch that shakes my soul.</p>
<p>If you are tired of those American films with red clothes and green makeup, I think you might as well go see this film; I guarantee that this is a work with its own style.</p>
<p>The story begins with the engineer Andre — this is a typical French neurotic man, who, through his brother-in-law's relationship, meets a Parisian girl, Fang Sha, who is tired of revolving in the bustling, hypocritical social circle. The encounter of these two tragic characters, coupled with the kindness and tolerance of the female wife, leads to the climax of this unfortunate story.</p>
<p>Charles Boyer plays the engineer, and his cultivation and understanding determine his superb acting skills, which almost make him impeccable in this film. At the same time, because he is French, his life, habits, and various internal or external conditions make his achievements in this film surpass all the American films he has made in Hollywood. The role of Fang Sha is played by French red star Mickey Marie. There is no question that she gave me a very good impression. She has always been steadily and gradually revealing the light purple glow that she should have in this drama, and she has not sought to please the audience at the expense of breaking the shallow phase of the harmonious atmosphere required to be created throughout the play.</p>
<p>I sincerely recommend this is a good film. I can not consider in the film itself whether I should add some heartfelt slander in addition to praise; in order to show off my judgment and vision. The only thing that makes me dissatisfied is that the Chinese translation of the name is too inappropriate. It would be better to translate it directly into "Storm" it seems to be more appropriate. (Late night, October 30)</p>
<h3>Bernays Reveals the Secrets of the Big Four Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>Former U.S. Secretary of State, Bernays, published his famous book "Secrets of the Big Four Diplomacy" in the United States on October 15th. In this book, he completely revealed the inside story of international conflicts that he witnessed firsthand. The publication of this famous book shocked the world, especially the Soviet Union. Chapter 9 of the book describes all the diplomatic secrets before and after Japan's surrender, which is extremely valuable. Here, we have specially selected and translated some parts for readers to enjoy first. The entire book has been translated and will be published and distributed by the News World Press immediately. Pre-orders can be made at the publishing department of this newspaper.</p>
<p>We must never forget that World War II broke out in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The drama that closed on the USS Missouri on September 1, 1945, opened in Manchuria in the same month of 1931. The scenes that followed were of concern to us in the United States - first Italy's invasion of Abyssinia in 1935, followed by the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Japan's invasion of China in 1937, the fall of Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1938, and Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939. But all these events have led us to the tragic Pearl Harbor incident on December 7, 1941.</p>
<p>If we regard Europe as the potential fuse of a world war, then we must regard Asia as a large mass of latent tinder. It is home to the majority of the world's population, eagerly awaiting the selection and adoption of civilization. Unfortunately, China has been embroiled in one war after another. Our enthusiastic efforts have failed, at least for the moment. Japan, on the other hand, has taken the lead in absorbing modern civilization and has made rapid progress! The Japanese people have been liberated from feudal and traditional economic systems and religious constraints, and all reforms have been initiated for the benefit of the people and society. All progress should be attributed to the wise command of General MacArthur, and our maintenance of the Japanese system to carry out the Supreme Commander's orders and policies has also been effective.</p>
<p>On July 17th, President Truman and Marshal Stalin met for the first time to discuss the Soviet Union's war against Japan. Marshal Stalin said that he had not yet concluded a treaty with China - this was a prerequisite for the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan. After the meeting, he would continue negotiations with Premier Song Ziwen. The sovereignty of Dalian Port was an issue to be resolved. President Truman declared that the United States was determined to keep Dalian as a commercial port. Stalin replied that this could be achieved if the Soviet Union obtained its management rights. At that time, I pointed out that, according to the Yalta Secret Agreement in which President Roosevelt participated, China should retain sovereignty over Dalian.</p>
<h3>The Health of Civil Servants</h3>
<p>— Yao Yinzhong</p>
<p>A few days ago (October 26th), the Shen Bao published a speech by Mayor O.K. Yui of Austria in Shanghai. He said that the high administrative efficiency of foreign countries is due to three reasons: first, high salaries, sufficient to maintain life; second, regular vacations, which allow the body and mind to be adjusted and the efficiency is doubled when returning to work; third, pensions after retirement, without worries about the future. He particularly emphasized the second point, so he advocated that our country should also emulate and implement it. He also said that since he became the head of Shanghai, his physique has deteriorated greatly, and he feels like he can't bear the burden.</p>
<p>Considering Mayor Wu's meaning, it is actually a health issue. As the Western saying goes, "A sound mind in a sound body," health is truly the most precious treasure in life. We must have a healthy body to do any career, not to mention those who work in the government. Especially not to mention a figure like Mayor Wu, but also countless small civil servants whose positions are far below Mayor Wu, how could it be otherwise!</p>
<p>Civil servants are the officials of the country, and they are the people who perform public duties for the country. Among civil servants, there are also many outstanding people who spare no effort to contribute their wisdom and talent to the country. If the government cannot pay close attention to the health of these civil servants and allow them to die of illness, it is truly an unparalleled loss to the country.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Tongzhi Emperor</h3>
<p>— Qun Lin</p>
<p>Among the ten emperors of the Qing Dynasty, the Tongzhi Emperor died at the youngest age, so many rumors spread that the emperor liked to travel incognito and contracted a serious illness and died. Whether this statement is true is not credible for the time being, but the fact that the emperor often liked to travel outside in plain clothes is true. The following are some anecdotes: The Tongzhi Emperor once went out in plain clothes through the back gate of the palace. A certain Hunan scholar, residing in the guild hall opposite Xiangxiang Marquis Yu Qi, was resting in bed one day when he saw a young man enter, looked at his essays on the table, and scribbled all over them in a clumsy manner, and left in a hurry. He was strange and asked the servant, who said: This is a guest of Lord Zeng, Lord Zeng is out and has not returned, so he wandered to your place. When Zeng returned, the scholar told him the situation, and Zeng was shocked and said: This is the current emperor. The scholar was very frightened and did not dare to enter the spring examination, and packed his bags and left that day. The Tongzhi Emperor once went to Liulichang to buy jade-printed Xuan paper and paid for it with melon-seed silver. The shopkeeper saw that it was not a common currency and refused to accept it, so he ordered the shop assistant to go and get money. When he arrived at the Meridian Gate, the shop assistant did not dare to enter and returned in a panic. The next day, the emperor sent a few eunuchs to compensate him. One day, he went out and was caught in the rain on the way, and took shelter in a monastery. There was a man in it, who was very poor. When asked what he did, he was a servant of a certain noble family. He was expelled by his master, so he begged for food in the kitchen to fill his stomach. He also asked where people like him could find the best employment, and he replied that the Guangdong Customs was the best. The emperor borrowed paper and pen and wrote a note of one tael, instructing him to hand it over to the Yamen of the Commander of the Infantry, to help him find a position. At that time, a certain person was in charge of the nine gates, received the letter, and immediately gave him money to prepare his clothes and go to the Guangdong Customs to take up his post, and that person started his career there. The eunuch An Dehai was illegal. When the emperor was young, he knew of his treachery. He often cut off the heads of clay figures with a small knife. When asked why, he said he was killing Little Anzi. Later, in the eighth year of Tongzhi, An Dehai falsely claimed to be carrying out imperial orders and left Beijing to weave dragon robes. When he passed through Dezhou, he was too ostentatious. The prefect Zhao Xin reported to Ding Baozhen, the governor of Shandong. Ding Guan reported the matter to the court. Tongzhi read Ding's report and immediately issued an edict ordering An Dehai to be executed on the spot. By the time Empress Dowager Cixi heard about it, although she wanted to save him, it was too late.</p>
<h3>Regarding Unmarried Women</h3>
<p>— Yang Ren</p>
<p>A few days ago, this publication had an article "Sent to Unmarried Women," which mainly said that the reason why women are unmarried is that, on the one hand, some men cannot afford the cost of marriage. On the other hand, some women have taken away men's jobs, so that men are unable to marry due to unemployment. Therefore, the conclusion is that women should go home and prepare to be brides. These opinions, of course, have their factual basis and are not unreasonable, but in terms of the meaning that women should eliminate dependence and seek independence, I always feel that I dare not agree. I think there is another major reason for women's lack of marriage: now our marriage system is that the old one has not died, and the new one has been born but has not yet become established; in the gap between the transition of the old and the new, many young men and women are suffering! And women's lack of marriage has become a common and serious problem in society. It is precisely because there is a gap between the old and the new that has not yet been straightened out, so those who are moving forward, standing at the forefront of the times, and those who are lagging behind and living at the bottom of the old society will not feel any suffocation or unhappiness; only those who are not forward and not backward, properly separated in the middle, are the truly suffering. In other words, only those semi-new and semi-old women who have received the education of the times but have not completely shed the concept of etiquette are the truly suffering in the gap.</p>
<p>Equality between men and women and open social interaction are slogans that have been heard for a long time, but in reality, where to have open social interaction is something that cannot be figured out. Especially for women, once they step into a dance hall or a general assembly hall, due to the "quality problems" of such places, criticism follows, and the ropes of etiquette bind you so that you can only stand still. Generally, parents who still have feudal air, say "listen to their freedom" about their children's marriage, but when they actually get a little freedom, they supervise them strictly and even complain. Free choice of partners is impossible, and blind marriage is not desirable, so in such an environment where the old and the new are disconnected - ten dark gaps - I don't know how many young people have been buried!</p>
<p>Of course, women's lack of marriage is not entirely due to this reason, but the irrationality of the marriage system - the disconnection between the old and the new, the inability to unify, makes a group of young ladies who want to be new but cannot, and are unwilling to be old, have nowhere to go, which is really the biggest addiction to wasting their youth.</p>
<h3>Hard to Change</h3>
<p>— Zhongli</p>
<p>General Patton received a telegram from the General Headquarters during the European War, telling him to be less humorous in his reports, because those reports would become part of the historical record. The telegram ended with an instruction to him: "Bypass Trier, and use four divisions to surround the city when it is captured." But by the time the telegram arrived, Trier had already been captured. Patton telegraphed back: "The city has been captured with two divisions, do you want me to give it back to the Germans to do it again?"</p>
