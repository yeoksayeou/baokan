<h3>經濟改革方案　初步綜合審查　開源節流均有所決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕參照經濟改革方案與國家動員綱領，全國經委會，經部，財部，四聯總處等組合之小組審查會，曾作初步綜合審查。茲探悉其內容如次</p>
<p>財政收入方面，增關稅源，提高稅率，支出方面裁併不必要機構，各機關經費非經核定與認爲無需要者不予增加。地方財政，力求自足，整頓現有稅收及稅率</p>
<p>行局放款以民生日用必需品各業爲對象，貸款方式以訂購及實物貸放爲原則。對國家行局與私人行莊之管制，將同時加强，防止走私與資金逃避，除加强緝私經費，擴充緝私實力外，國內匯兌歸中央銀行全權調配。對管制金融，已擬有管制城市金融辦法，對行莊經營業務，加强檢查，嚴禁逾規，限制分支機構設立，調查來往戶頭，規定貸款對象，審核貸款用途等，皆有明文確定</p>
<p>物價方面，以掌握物資爲基本方針，花紗布之調節，將以花控制紗，紗控制布爲手段，由棉紡織調節委會負責處理，價格將視市塲供需情形，由各廠商聯合議價，而其配給則以複製業爲主要對象。</p>
<p>食油供應，由中紡公司負責供給，暫在京滬兩地實施，配售燃煤則指定數大煤鑛增加生產，即由燃管委會統　收費，以供給各公用事　及交通用煤，俟有餘力，再予民用，其供給亦暫以京滬兩地爲限。</p>
<p>增加生產方面，則加速處理各未能售出之敵僞工廠，或予修理，或予拆除，使每一器材皆能盡其最大效用。日本賠償工廠，希望能善予配合生產。在各重要地區設立工鑛器材庫，俾材料能順利調節與儲存。各地工商輔導處能參加各地對工鑛貸款之專先審核，事後考查。</p>
<p>國際貿易方面，以現在機構繁多，職權分散，不如組織一統一機構，全權處理。輸出物資將增加收購，出口押匯範圍將予擴大，出口成本將予减低。</p>
<p>商業管理，除扶助正當商業外，對投機取巧，囤積居奇將嚴予取締。爲活潑各商業行號之資金運用，將加速完成資產重估計，股本升値。爲謀各地游資有所歸宿，以免爲禍市塲，酌量於各重要城市設立證劵市塲。</p>
<h3>魏德邁啓程前　先檢討我局勢</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十四日電〕官方今日希望魏德邁本週赴華作實地調查，將促成美國在遠東採取更積極政策。惟美國對華政策進退兩難，魏氏此行結果能否找一出路，此間官方信念亦不甚堅強。本週初，魏氏將與國務院檢討中國局勢最近演變，然後啓程赴華調查各種事實。舉凡朝鮮與旅順，大連等地蘇軍行動，以及中共與蘇聯政府關係之證據，大致均在調查範圍之內。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十四日電〕記者今日自官方獲悉，美駐華公使銜參事白德華，在其返華前，留華盛頓商討期間，將在國務院中國科任職。渠將於十五日或十六日向馬歇爾提出報吿，並與國務院其他官員有所討論。</p>
<h3>美贈我大批船艦　我已接正式通知</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕軍聞社訊：美贈我之二百七十一艘船艦，我當局業已接獲正式通知，內海軍艦艇佔百餘艘，其中一部份在華，大多已由我海軍當局接受，日內續有驅逐潛艇六艘在靑接受，聞該項船艦現在美者，將於本年內由我在美受訓結業之海軍官兵，分批駛返。</p>

<p>〔中央社北平十五日電〕央行總裁張嘉激，十五日晨十時半赴津，聯合國亞洲及遠東經濟委員會經濟顧問吉帕特利克同行，據悉，張氏定十六日晨飛瀋，交涉東北食糧轉運事宜。</p>

<h3>中日貿易問題　各方未表樂觀</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京十五日電〕中國各界對於八月十五日後之中日貿易希望，頗表冷淡。渠等對於麥克阿瑟意欲津貼日本出口貿易政策，頗爲不滿。聞行政院十五日下午將召集外交，經濟兩部之代表，討論日本出口津貼政策。商界方面，深懼此項津貼政策，將引起日本之傾銷政策，而妨害中國工業。官方指出美國反對前行政政院長之獎勵政策，然美却爲戰敗日本，考慮採取同一措施。至於中日貿易前途，皆認爲並不十分光明。大部分日本出口貨物，皆在中國進口禁止之列，而中國又不能供給日本所需之商品，如大豆煤斤等，此外尚有匯兌上之困難。迄今爲止，中國法幣與日元之間尚無規定之匪率。一切交易，皆以美金計算，此亦認爲不可實行者。因中國之外匯準備似欠充實也。但現已採取各項步驟，準　參加對日貿易。經濟部決定請求全國商聯會及工業協會，各提出一百九十二家通商者之名單，以便政府從中選擇六十四家。此數乃盟軍總部所允許中國提出者。其中將包括八家海外貿易商在內。</p>
<h3>張君勱曾向政府　提修明政治建議</h3>
<p>將先從江南着手</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕民社黨主席張君勱，十五日於民社黨談話會後對記者表示，渠曾向政府提供修明政治之建議。關於此事、政府可能先自長江以南各省着手辦理，並將在可能範圍內，實行文人主政之原則。至今秋普選，採用何種方式進行，原則猶在商討，尚未決定。</p>
<h3>馬鴻逵飛京</h3>
<p>〔中央社寗夏十五日電〕西北行轅副主任兼寗省主席馬鴻達，十五日下午四時半專機由寗飛京述職。</p>
<h3>蘇聯如不中立　中國將無和平　傳斯年在美稱</h3>
<p>〔合衆社舊金山十四日電〕傅斯年十四日抵此，據稱：若蘇聯協助中國共產黨一日，則中國統一亦一日不能實現。中國之統一因美國援助不多，蘇聯亦未中立，可能尚需二三年之時間。傅氏對日本可能東山再起而爲一侵略國家事殊表憂慮，並謂：「日本雖對麥帥十分順從，但君等必須明白日人乃狡猾民族，彼等之行爲極不誠實」。</p>
<h3>蘇艦泊烟台附近　卸軍火援助中共</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕確息：近有蘇聯運輸艦駛泊烟台附近之浪壩，起卸軍火二千噸，補給山東共軍，旅大亦不斷有蘇艦運糧接濟遼南殘共，我軍政當局對此報吿頗爲重視。</p>

<h3>劉克儁談配額　謂極鄭重從事</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕行憲法規通過後，各方對國代及立委名額分配頗多不滿，職團婦女界及僑胞團體咸有意見提出，認爲名額分配有加修正之必要。記者十五日訪立院憲法法規委會召集人劉克儁，探詢對此意見，承談立院討論名額分配時，法理事實兼顧，各委員研討時咸極鄭重，每一決定莫不經長時間之討論，當無不公允之事。關於立委聯業代表名額分配，最後規定爲八十四名，國務會議已予通過，故有其充分之法律把握。商人團體規定五名，亦係限於事實。根據原案，農工團體應分配百之六十，現已予以减少，可見立院討論此類分配時，谷方面咸曾顧及。至全國性婦女團體須有五個分會一點，最初係某女性立委提出，其原意在使婦女團體得以健全，各委員咸認爲用意極善，乃予通過。現婦女團體尚可登記，各地成立分會時間上尚許可。談及僑胞名額分配，院中討論時，自孫院長以下，莫不主張增加，事實上亦已增加，當不能謂不公平。</p>

<h3>共軍背信破壞黃河復堤　國軍決奮起反擊　聯總派赴共區復堤人員應即撤退　陳總長通知克利扶蘭</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十五日電〕共匪劉伯减部背信棄義，渡河南犯，破壞復　，陳參謀總長曾於七月八日以備忘錄通知聯總駐華辦事處長克利扶蘭，茲將備忘錄錄誌於後：「克利扶蘭處長勵鑒：七月一日張壕六一四號備忘錄計達，查共軍劉伯誠部，此次渡河進犯國軍防地，不特有違雙方停戰諾言，抑且欺騙聯絡，利用復　名義擴大叛亂，故前准艾格頓將軍請政府保證於最近數週內，不受政府軍事威脅之限制，鷹歸無效，聯絡派遣共軍區域內復堤工作人員，應尅日撤退，否則復　員工遭受意外損害時，政府碍難負責。至關於共黨背約棄信之理由，幷請向共方質詢見示，特此通知　下查照辦理，幷請賜復爲幸。參謀總長陳誠敬啓。」</p>
<p>又，國防部軍事發言人，十五日發表談話稱：本年黃汎期將屆關於黃河復堤工程，政府前曾同意聯總駐華辦事處處長克利扶蘭建議之復堤計劃，組織混合委員會，並商定在黃河沿岸區域內雙方即日停止一切軍事行動，政府此種措施，純爲　念千百萬人民之生命財產而臨空前浩刧，故對於行將敉平之共匪劉伯誠部，通令魯豫區國軍暫停追剿，以便　築河堤，防堵氾濫，陳德長曾以指揮軍事立塲，正式函復聯總艾格頓將軍，　保障黃河復堤員工不遭受軍事上之威脅。幷提供三項意見，請聯總注意，即（一）在共匪區內參加復堤工作人員，應由聯總保證不得夾雜有共匪武裝部隊；（二）每一渡口爲復堤而使用之木船，應以五十種爲限；（三）混合委員會有積極成立之必要，幷應在魯境黃河北岸各工區設立辦事處。厥後政府即派本部葉南少將代表政府前往參加混合委員會，在　夜搶修尤恐不及之際，乃共匪劉伯誠所屬之楊勇部五千餘人先於六月二十二日由運河附近之十里舖渡河南犯，而劉伯誠之第一·二·三·六·七等五個縱隊亦於六月三十日夜十二時半於濮縣以南十公里吳西莊附近渡河，乘國軍撤防趕工期間，　佔　口，掩護後續隊，繼續南渡，侵據北王趙，攻陷郵城，圍攻鄆城，本日據報，　河共匪已達三萬餘人。似此利用聯總復隄爲名而行渡河之實，背棄信守，竊取機會，使黃河沿岸我防守軍民蒙受意外損害。茲特鄭重聲明：今後國軍爲自衛計，爲　豫區數百萬善良同胞之生　及安密秩序計，自當奮起反擊，將不受聯總艾格頓將軍「將政府保證於最近數週內不受我軍事威脅」之限制，並自即日起，凡在魯豫地區所有聯總從事復隄之員工，應即撤至安全地區，否則因而遭受意外之損害時，政府碍難負責。</p>
<h3>磯谷昨再度受鞫　辯論終結定廿二日宣判</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十五日電〕日戰犯磯谷廉介，十五日晨於國防部戰犯法庭再度受鞫，進行辯論。九時一刻始，直至十二時許始辯論畢事，庭諭辯論終結，定廿二日宣判。</p>
<p>辯護律師兩點意見庭長石美　　審判官等一行蒞庭，宜佈開庭後，首由指定辯護律師玉淑貞，陳漢淸起立提出意見，王稱：被吿於十二日曾提呈申辯書，說明被吿尚有證件多種在日，已在寄京途中，庭上對此是否有再予偵查之必要，而對辯論日期予以更改？陳稱：根據被吿所稱，渠乃我先總理之忠實信徒，力倡中日親善，對於中國革命亦有所供獻，是否可請　　陶先先出出爲證人？石庭長答稱：所述兩點，經評議結果，第一點。所稱申辯書，本庭至今尚未收到；第二點：對於被吿之違反人道罪等部份，吾人根據其平日道德行爲，即可斷定，不必傳戴先生等作證。至於申辯書未到期問，吾人可延長其辯論時間，而不能更改日期。</p>
<p>磯谷狡辯一套老調是時，即由檢察官　　論斷，歷述其罪行後，磯谷開始答辯。首就在港放逐平民一點予以申辯稱：疏散人民乃出於人民自願返鄉，首先向民事部登記後辦理選鄉，係屬自願，而非强迫；另一部份被放逐者，則係不良份子，爲保障大多數人民秩序起見，始有放逐罪民之事，唯實未放逐平民。次及戰爭罪部份，狡辯一如偵查庭，僅稱渠對中日親善之觀念始終不變，在華及香港時期均有所表現，所有加於彼身之戰爭罪名，據謂實與時間空間不符合。旋再辯關於違反人道罪部份，磯谷仍稱所有軍隊不法行爲與渠無關。末對在港施行毒化政策一點稱：　進抵香港時，港埠烟舖甚多，烟民亦極多，乃決意採取漸减法而予以登記，並公賣之，並無毒化之意。旋即以答辯書送呈庭上，時已十一時四十分。</p>
<p>兩位律師辯護盡職　旋由辯護律師起立代爲申辯，陳律師首先就磯谷之「戰犯」名稱予以否定，認爲磯谷來華時，已不足稱爲戰犯，應請庭上研究。其餘申辯三點：（一）違反和平罪係因磯谷之工作而推測其對於日本侵　大計定曾參加，但此僅爲猜測而非事實，故不成立；（二）構成戰爭罪及違反人道罪，與時間地點諸證均不符，毒化香港一點，認爲香港原有烟毒流行，應不負　化責任；（三）放邊平民一事，乃係放逐擾亂治安不良份子，以保大多數人民之安全，並未放逐平民。結論係請庭上從輕裁判。王律師對違反和平，公賣販賣鴉片，加害平民，放逐平民等諸點，均予以抹煞，强調磯谷乃自幼即愛中華民國，且爲總理忠實信徒，倡中日提携，對我領土並無侵略野心等。辯論至十二時許始畢。</p>

<h3>社論　從美國看世界</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統於星期一在白宮，召見參議院外交委員會主席范登堡以及參衆兩院共和民主兩黨領袖，舉行重要會議，檢討現行國際局勢。事後據范登堡談稱，杜魯門總統認爲今秋並無召集國會舉行特別會議的必要；但若有緊急局勢的發生，則仍保留召開國會舉行特別會議的權力云。從白宮會議看整個的世界，可知今日的世界，尚徊徊在戰爭與和平的十字路口。我們如以愉快的心情，觀察今後世界的動向，則也未嘗不可以樂觀，至少在最近的五年或十年之內，沒有一個國家敢輕言戰爭，沒有一國的人民願意戰爭，所以，無論如何，「沒有戰爭」的和平，終可以維持五年或者十年之久。但是天有不測風雲，國際局勢千變萬化，對於世界政局的發展，誰也不能預言；尤其負有世界安危責任的美國，刻正在作未雨綢繆之計。實在使我們不能樂觀。</p>
<p>最近美國積極準備未來大戰的措施，最惹人注目的，有下列數項：（一）美國陸軍部已擬就一項六年計劃，以儲藏在美洲大陸上難於取得而爲戰爭再度爆發時所必需之軍事原料；包括蘇聯印度及非洲最近發現之稀金屬，以及自中東輸入美國之石油。（二）美國海軍依照比基尼珊瑚羣島試騐原子炸彈所獲得之結論，唯有潛水艇始能避免原子炸彈的襲擊，業已開始建造超級潛水艇隊，將來可以作爲偵察及運輸之用。（三）日本以前在太平洋上所有的島嶼，在未來大戰中頗有軍略價値，將由聯合國機構移交美國單獨託管，美國國會乃起草一項法案，業經參衆兩院通過，卽將提交白宮，請杜魯門總統簽署。</p>
<p>美國在軍事上積極準備，以應付未來國際上的大變，雖屬於消極性質，且有加深國際局勢的危險性；但是在另一方面看來，美國在政治上外交上經濟上，旣無辦法消除國際上對立的形勢，從而促進國際問的諒解與合作，共同維持永久性的和平，自然唯有在軍事上作未雨綢繆之計，以備萬一：或因美國實力的强大與準備的充足，反而能消弭他國侵略的野心，所謂止戈爲武，以戰爭消滅戰爭。我們回想起第二次大戰爆發前夕的一般歷史，愛好和平民主國家之荏弱，適足以鼓勵侵略者的氣燄；一般歷史學家咸謂，當法西斯蒂的日本，義大利曁納粹德國開始發動侵略時，如能迎頭予以痛擊，則第二次世界大戰或不致爆發：卽使爆發，如果民主國家早有充分之準備，力能阻制日本的侵略中國及德國的侵略波蘭，則第二次大戰決不致拖延如此長久。所以美國最近在作未雨綢繆之計，無論如何，終是値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>大戰勝利結束以來，將近整整的兩個年頭，國際局勢的演變，每况愈下，實在太令人失望了；戰時盟國爭取勝利，勝利終於實現了；戰後盟國締造和平，不僅未能有所成就，反而使和平離開這個世界，愈去愈遠了。杜魯門總統鑒於世界局勢的嚴重，並認爲若干國家有遭受外來威脅之　，特向國會提出援希士兩國的計劃，扶助她們養成强大的實力，足以抵制外來勢力的侵入，乃成爲今日人人皆知的杜魯門主義，我們平心而論，杜魯門主義的目的，也在維持世界的和平；殊不料杜魯門主義竟引起了蘇聯的深刻反響，匃牙利首先發生了政變，保加利亞與羅馬尼亞也有類似的事件發生，使巴爾幹若干國家更加受到蘇聯的控制，歐洲分裂的現象，也隨着益見露骨了。這種可怕的趨勢，如果不設法挽回，則有使世界更加嚴重的危機。馬歇爾國務卿鑒於杜魯門主義的行不通，也就有將美國外交政策改弦易轍的意向，乃於上月初在哈佛大學演說，提出美國在經濟上援助歐洲各國復興的計劃，其動機有二：（一）將蘇聯亦列入美國援歐計劃的範圍之內，以試探蘇聯有無與美國合作的誠意；（二）援助歐洲各戰災國家，使其社會經濟以及政治，不致陷於崩潰。而有利於共產黨的滋長發育。但是馬歇爾計劃發表後所得的結果，却招致歐洲的分裂，不僅蘇聯拒不參加歐洲經濟會議，而且蘇聯的八個附庸國家，也拒絕英法的邀請，蘇聯又有什麽「莫洛托夫計劃」的發表，企圖組織東歐中歐經濟集團；從此歐洲，非墨卽楊，兩大集團的分野，劃分得更加明明白白的了。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，歐洲經濟會議，自然不會有良好的成就，美國援助歐洲所需經費要在二百萬萬美元左右，美國納稅人早就有要求减輕負祖的呼聲，看到歐洲的實際情形，更不願將大批金錢用有於歐洲。所以瞻望歐洲的前途，更加覺得黯淡無色了。</p>
<h3>急待解決之房租問題</h3>
<p>房屋租賃問題，爲目前急待解決的問題之一，亦是目前很難解決的問題之一。今天市府將邀集有關各方面共同商討了，其腹案如何，結果如何，均尚在未可知之數。我們認爲如果要把本問題作有效的解決，不可不顧到下列四點：</p>
<p>一·務須兼籌並顧，不可專爲片面着想。現在房產業無利可圖是事實，房荒嚴重，覓屋困難也是事實：新屋無人建造，舊屋無人修理，善良的業主，忍痛賠累，束手無策，其刁鑽而兇惡的，却百般勒索，屢增房租，公然超過市府規定的租率，乃至千倍甚而萬倍，更是事實。所以市府如果要甫行規定租率，務須顧到各方面的利害，酌兩用中，權衛至當，庶可以利推行而洽　情。</p>
<p>二·令出惟行，不可徒成具文。上文所說：善良的坐受賠累，兇惡的百般勒索，卽由徒法不能自行之故。所以議定了劃一的租率，必須同時議定切實執行的辦法，並與司法機關密切聯繫，認眞執行，使守法的有所保障，違法的無從橫行，而後此項重新規定的新租率，始有意義。否則一紙空文，等於目前的狀况，斷不能改進目前租賃的狀况，亦斷不能减除雙方的痛苦，或且有治絲益紊之　。</p>
<p>三·房客漁利的惡習，，必須予以糾正。現在一般善良的業主，雖多數在明虧暗蝕之中，而許多房客，部所謂二房東者，却覇佔了他人的產業，要索項費，高價出租，坐收不當的利得。此等情形，斷無何等正當的理由可以解釋。今爲維護一般房客起見，對於業主，如仍須加以相當的限制，則對於類似業主的二房東，自尤應切實限制，以昭事理之平。否則原此薄彼，徒然保障了二房東，將愈增業主的觖望，而無補於三房客痛苦的解除。</p>
<p>四·外幣及實物付租，必須嚴加禁止。外幣付租，政府早經禁止，但實際上並未絕跡。至於實物付租，以物價過於波動之故，此風也漸漸由內地波及到上海。這不但損害法幣的信用，且加深了房客的負担。無論租率調整與否，此事允宜嚴厲禁止，以維護大多數人的福利。</p>
<p>所謂租賃問題，其實太複雜了。業主要求：房租之限制，應依土地法第九十七條之規定，這是根據法律的。有期的租賃合同，應否無限期予以延長，這也屬法律問題。而開放房地產作押之禁令，及籌設土地銀行，融通長期資金，更與解決房荒，活動金融有關。我們揣想：市府急其所急，或尙無暇及此，故仍僅就房租問題，略貢所見，作爲當局的參考。</p>

<h3>英美注視希局勢發展　聯合艦隊駛雅典　安理會特召開緊急會議　伊庇魯斯方面希政府軍轉爲有利</h3>

<h3>各委會組織工作完成　歐洲會議將休會　定九月一日完成各國資源調查</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎十五日廣播：歐洲十六國經濟會議負責人頃宣稱：美國會在冬季前雖不能對馬歇爾計劃採取行動，但歐洲復興之合作組織，仍將繼續進行。法官方宣稱：參加此次會議之十六個歐洲國家，原定九月一日完成各該國資源與美元需要之調查，此項計劃，迄無任何變更。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十五日電〕歐洲經濟會議今日召開第三次全體大會，討論議事規州委員會所提五技術小組與一秘書處組織草案。此次大會將爲八月底以前最後一次。主席貝文表示一切進行順利。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎十四日電〕歐洲經濟大會工作委員會今日一致通過實行馬歇爾計劃之最後草案，指定英，法，義大利，挪威及荷蘭五國組織執行委員會，並議決四按術小組委員人選如次：糧食與農業—英，法，丹，希，愛爾蘭，氷島，義大利及荷蘭。鋼鐵工業—英，法，　森堡，挪威及土耳其。運輸，—英，法，比利時，挪成，葡萄牙，瑞士及土耳其。燃料與電力—英，法，奧地利，比利時，丹麥，希臘，土耳其，瑞典及瑞士。各委員會人選將於十五日提交第三次全體大會正式批准。據法國人士聲稱，十五日大會恐係八月底以前最後一次，以後須俟委員會工作完成，再行召開。合作委員會將由與會十六國全體參加，對於執行委員會之決議，總攬監　大權。工作委員會並通過設立秘書處，由法國代表塞魯勒任秘書長，十六日開始工作。此次瑞典未被列入執行委員會，且除燃料與電力小組會外，亦未參加其餘三小組。鋼鐵及該國主要工業之一，而鋼鐵工業小組中並無其名，此點殊堪注目。同時，荷蘭代表團發言人表示荷蘭將促使德國西部包括在歐洲復興計劃以內，據稱德國乃荷蘭天然內地，其西部必須加入十六國組織，俾令法國佔領區與英美佔領區合而爲一。此外，蘇聯繼續關切大會進行情形甚爲明　。克里姆林宮雖對會　深感不快，但仍予以密切注意。</p>
<h3>蘇大使訪義外長</h3>

<h3>馬歇爾發表演說　闡明美援歐必要　美與歐洲友邦關係面臨轉折點</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社美國鹽湖城十四日電〕馬歇爾國務卿今晚向此間州長會　發表演詞，警吿美國人民謂：美國之援助倘不來臨，歐洲各國或　轉移方向而不利於美國。美國一旦認識此種事實，必當　然　予此種援助。關於此點政府之獲得民衆充分擁護，乃屬必要。馬卿稱：使普通人淸楚明瞭國際問題，實爲　事，除非英語大家如邱吉爾者絕難將外交詞令與迫切的現實相混合，使常人明瞭閒題眞相。美國人對於歐洲克服國家壁壘解決共同經濟閒題之努力，應寄以熱烈與同情之諒解。</p>
<p>美國人民對於當前世界問題，務必有所決定，此種決策對於將來時局演變，有深遠之影響。我國對舊世界各傳統友邦之關係，正處於轉換點，此層不容漢視。吾人若不元成援助各該國家之任務，使其適應新時代之需要，即須坐視各該國轉變方向，違背其本身之傳統及我國之傳統。果爾，美國在全世界之地位將急劇轉變。截至目前爲止，恢復歐洲經濟之努力，雖未成功，但其嘉惠所及，實較一般人認識者爲大。美國現可更加準確估計歐洲各國之需要，並正自以美國利益觀點，以極大審慎，研究各種可能的解決方法之實施</p>
<h3>貝文今日返英</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十五日電〕英方人士相信貝文外祖或將於今日或明日趕回倫敦，出席星期四在哈斯丁召開之運輸及一般職工協會會議。巴黎會議如能依照預定計劃發展，則各國代表團領袖於今日以後即可委託專家進行委員會之工作。貝文於達到此一階段後，即將以會務委諸英代表團領袖專家弗朗克氏負責進行。</p>

<p>〔合衆社倫敦十四日電〕波蘭政府發言人頃在此間記者招待會中斥重巴黎所舉行之經濟會議，其主要目的之一，殆在使德國復興。渠又解釋波蘭拒絕參加之原因稱，華沙曾接到秘密之情報，會議事前早已安排就緒，故多少是一個「傀儡」會議而已。</p>
<h3>美衆院共和黨領袖主張國會單獨調查國外槪况　以便明年擬訂對外援助法案</h3>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十五日電〕共和黨總統候選人史泰遜，十五日主張擬定一項愼重考慮及有效之計劃，務使克林姆宮相信共黨如欲潛入美國而加以控制，必無成功之望。史氏堅決擁護馬歇爾計劃，要求國會在休會前即採取行動，俾政府有權預先訂購五億美元之工業設備。史氏幷謂，「吾人幷未放　　絕參加巴黎會議之東歐八國」。</p>
<h3>美共和黨議員梅遜主張　與蘇聯實行絕交　只有議員主張停止救濟東歐</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四日電〕若千共和黨議員主張對拒絕參加馬歇爾之經濟復興計劃或拒絕與美國合作之東歐國家，實行經濟封鎖政策。伊列諾埃州衆議員趨遜聲言渠主張美國與蘇聯斷絕外交關係，在蘇聯準備合作前，使其陷於孤立。同州議員狄克遜主張使拒絕參加馬歇爾計劃之東歐國家，不得接受三億五千萬元戰災國救濟計劃之救濟。威斯康辛州議員貝恩斯，透露渠已上書總統，請停止對拒絕參加巴黎會議各國之救濟。</p>
<h3>美國停止糧食輸捷</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十四電〕業部長安特森今在記者招待會中述及蘇聯與捷克所訂之小麥協定時，聲音美國目前不擬以任何糧食供給捷克。美國對於得自他處獲得適當糧食供應之國均不擬供給穀糧。安氏雖未指責蘇聯不以糧食供給需要國家，但曰蘇聯本年有大宗餘糧可供出口。安氏復日德境英美兩區欲期在農業上自給自足，已無希望。安氏於述及若干歐洲國家之拒絕參加經濟合作會議時，謂美國不計政治關係，永遠以慈悲爲懷，渠誠不知美國尚需要如何之慈悲。安氏復透露渠在此次視察德國之報吿書中，將着重增產魯爾煤斤，以增加德國之出口，易取糧食之輸入。</p>
<h3>英拒美邀請　商魯爾煤斤問題</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦十四日電〕關於美政府邀請英國舉行　境英美佔領區會議，以討論增加魯爾區煤斤生產，並決定英美佔領區之工業新水準一事，頃據負責人士談稱，英政府業已拒絕美國之邀請。英政府在歐洲經濟合作會議結束之前，寗願暫　討論此等問題。</p>
<h3>煤礦國營問題　日閣意見紛歧</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十五日電〕日本之煤礦國家管理閒題，似足以影響片山內閣之存亡問趣，關於其管理之對象及方式，即在閣內意見尚不能完全一致。又在社會黨提案與民主黨提案之間，亦有相當之距離，而除作成妥協案外，殊難維持與黨之合作關係。此種情勢下，爲謀取與黨之提携，乃於十四日召開與黨三派之聯絡會議，由各黨委員說明其茲本意見。又在政府內部，社民兩黨出身閣僚之主張亦異，故此時應以適當之方法，作成妥協案。因此西尾以致府代表之資格，亦參加三派聯絡會，雜此妥協案之作成，似需要相當時日，而又不能不　出此次團會，否則或將演變爲政治問題。</p>

<p>雷討論之初，保守黨白持勒聲一屬於海特拉間。明保守黨不擬拖延該一法案，惟其中有若干點尚待予以澄清。印緬事務部次官漢特森答稱，安達曼，尼柯巴，及拉卡迪夫等三羣島，將成印度自治邦之一部，此等羣島之準備獨立，須徹求其他關係自治邦政府之意見（安達曼，尼柯巴兩羣島位於孟加拉灣；拉卡迪夫羣島位於阿刺伯海）。海特拉巴邦管轄之貝拉爾，仍將屬於海特拉巴。</p>

<h3>南京路惠羅公司隔壁三樓　疊戶重門一秘窟金鈔黑市場破獲　主從犯顧客等十人就逮</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕警察局經濟科昨日破獲一大規模之金鈔黑市秘密交易機關，此一機關佈置週密，行動狡獲，但終於難逃法　。</p>
<p>南京東路八十八號，在四川路口惠羅公司隔壁，爲一三層大樓形建築，底下爲哈來斯餐室，二層三層則爲商行公司之寫字間。此屋樓梯居中，終年不見陽光，陰暗曲折，頗有神秘色彩。三樓七號即爲金鈔機關之所在地，平日門外掛有「鴻安證券號」招牌，不知者固以爲係一正當證券字號也。然其內部則佈置有如機關，所謂房內有房，門內有門，重重套房共有五間之多。交易處所則在最內心一間內，外間爲談判講價之所，並派有一職員專聽電話，接洽買賣，談妥後始至內間交易。平日光臨之顧客，中外俱有，秘密經營，已非一日。</p>
<p>一週前警局經濟科獲眼綫密報，知悉有此機關，即派遣幹員詳細追蹤偵查，確係事實，乃於昨日上午，該科徐幼祚科長率同幹員沈嘉麟，景慶海及經濟警察十餘人開始行動。上午十一時半自警局出發，十一時三刻抵達該處，爲免打草驚蛇，武裝警察暫先埋伏樓下，沈等便衣警察混充顧客，進入該三樓七號，直向內室走去。此時在外室之職員，即擬押詢渠等何往。沈等一面含糊以「找姓王的」應倖，一面迅速奔向內套　，及抵則內套房門已內局，在內交易者已聽悉外面風聲不對，紛將金鈔掩藏於秘密抽屜內。但徐科長早已在另一間可以望到此內套房中動作，故金鈔掩藏何處，已一目了然，同時招呼樓下之武裝警察上樓。</p>

<p>此時該機關中職員極爲狡猾，竟將私裝之對講電綫三根剪斷兩根，餘一根被警察發覺阻止。此對講電話極爲忙碌，正不斷有華人與西人詢問金鈔黑市價格。</p>
<p>當塲搜查之下，抄川美鈔四千七百五十一元，金條大條四條，小條二十三條，金鐲三只，金戒二十一只，鎖片一塊，港幣一百九十元。又在外室顧客身上抄出金鐲三只，小天平一只，鑲鑽金片一張，及小鑽戒一只等。</p>
<p>另兩主犯在逃未獲</p>
<p>此一機關係主犯姜成琪，黃耀庭，蔣承良三人合股組成。黃與蔣斯時已離去，故未拘獲。美成琪及賬房陳立章，電話員丁炳章，跑街吳國昌，顧客沈錫榮（珠寳商），奚翔龍（比國沙城洋行練習生），杜劭曾（阿根廷大使館事務員），黃祖鴻，來樂生（華泰旅館練習生），張功培等十人均當塲就逮。全案人犯現已暫押警局拘留所繼續偵訊中。</p>

<h3>聞蘭亭更審未到　嵇希宗出庭作證　出任僞職均經核准有案</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕敵僞時期海上「三老」之一聞蘭亭，被控漢奸嫌疑一案，前經高院判處有期徒刑八年，嗣經最高法院審核該案，以聞蘭亭之出任僞職，是否於事前經中央核准，抑屬事後呈准，尚有詳細調查之必要，乃將原判決撤銷，發還更審。該案昨在高院審理，聞蘭亭因病重在華山路紅十字會醫院療養，未能到庭受審，由辯護律師代表出庭。證人中央黨部專員嵇希宗應傳陳述設言，據稱：我於三十年六月奉命來滬工作，担任中統局駐滬專員，兼兩路特別黨部委員，經人介紹與聞相識。至太平洋戰事發生後，呈准中央與聞半亭進一步發生工作上的關係。主要爲供給經濟情報。其間，三十一年一月聞任僞市商會監事長，卅二年五月六日任僞上海市民衆福利協會理事長，卅二年十月任棉統會主任委員，卅三年六月任僞商統會理事長，均經中統局核准有案，因彼時上海敵氛囂張，情形紊亂異常我利用其職務上的關係，掩護地下工作，當時聞確曾保留大批棉紗物資。卅二年五六月間並在聞家設秘密電台，與中央暗通消息，詳細情形，可函中統局查詢。嵇證畢，辯護律師起立稱：被告病勢甚重，大小便均須由看護扶持，因此無法到庭應訊，可否由法院派員至病榻前訊問，俾便早日結案，庭諭其狀聲請聽候裁定</p>
<h3>遠東國際軍庭我法官　梅汝璈博士過滬談司機被捕眞相</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕遠東國際軍事法庭我國代表法官梅汝璈博士，前因該庭暑期休假返國述職，已於日前由京返滬。記者頃晤梅氏於其旅邸，談及上月十八日國內各報所載東京電訊，梅氏汽車司機被捕事件。其事雖微，且已過去，但當時電訊簡略，國人不明眞象，頗多揣測，有謂其被捕司機爲華人，而逮捕之憲兵爲日人者，內地報紙更有以「東京一怪事」爲標題者，以訛傳訛，誤會滋深。記者就此叩詢梅氏當時實際經過情形。梅氏微笑曰：此原爲一細微之偶然事件，祗以東京電訊過份簡略且略近誇大，致勞國人關懷。旣承相詢，即就當時事件發生經過以告。</p>
<p>梅氏稱：遠東國際法庭十一位法官，名義上雖爲麥郎所任命，實際上爲各國所推薦，並代表其本人之國家。職是，此十一人在東京形成一特殊集團，享受特殊榮譽待遇，每人在東京長華麗之帝國飯店佔一套房，計有辦公室·客廳·臥室共三間，均有冷氣設備（東京惟一有冷氣設備之住所）。此外，每一法官並有盟軍總部配予之最新式</p>
<p>轎車一輛，前後懸有國徽標記。司機悉爲美國駐日第八軍汽車大隊之軍曹。梅氏司機爲美軍上士查爾傑士。此項法官特別汽車外漆紅字，庭長爲第一號，美國爲第二號，中國爲第三號，英國爲第四號，蘇聯爲第五號。馳騁過市，即使述犯交通規則，軍憲警察亦不得中途攔阻扣留，僅能記其號碼，容後交涉。蓋尊重法官地位而免阻碍其公務之進行。</p>
<p>法庭開庭十四個月以來，每日上午均係九時半開庭，各法官乘車於九時一刻自寓所疾駛往法庭（陸軍省舊址），約十分鐘可達。六月十七日九時一刻，梅氏按時擬往法庭，時司機查爾傑士不在寓所，侍者遍尋不得，時已九時半。電話詢問汽車總管理處，亦不知司機之去處。再經轉詢查所屬之汽車大隊，始知查於三月初旬曾因細故違犯</p>
<p>軍規，是日九時被美國憲兵司令部傳詢。事前查米及通知梅法官，亦未通知總管理處另派車輛。經詢明後，乃由該處將梅氏軍送法庭，時已十時許。梅氏爲顧全禮貌，於抵庭後，即以紙條通知庭長韋勃爵士，說明遲到原因。韋氏以爲梅氏有所不快，代爲表示</p>
<p>憤槪即高聲當衆宣佈：「憲兵總部傳訊法官之司機，而不事光通知法官，跡近蔑視法庭」。時檢察官與被告律師正在辯論，遽被阻斷審判，於是小事變大，電訊傳出，爲舉世週知。</p>
<p>梅氏繼稱：此事至爲平淡，且係偶然，但英美人士，習於法治精神，尊重法官，固不足怪。國人則誤以爲梅氏司機爲華人，而憲兵則爲日人，實則日本無一兵卒，更無所謂憲兵，即警察非經盟軍總部許可，亦不得持槍。</p>
<p>國際法庭自六月廿七日起，休處六星期，至八月四日爲止。梅氏定於月底赴日，日內將出席復且大學法律學會師生之歡迎會。</p>
<h3>兵役座談會　徐局長致詞　建議智識青年從軍　完成建國重大任務</h3>

<h3>第二批東北義軍　三百餘人抵滬</h3>

<h3>製假金條　混用敗露　一犯甫釋被捕一犯潛逃</h3>
<p>可憐攤販歷年積蓄　購得贗鼎不知所終</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紹興人熊文斌，現年四十二歲，住於南市肇周路二〇一號，　一煤炭店伙計，平日爲人向不安穩。一月以前，熊於途中邂逅友人時靑和，時爲某銀樓工匠，兩人言談之際，時忽吐露擬製造假金條騙錢之意，熊覺有利可圖，見獵心喜，兩人即談妥合作，決定以熊家肇周路二〇一號爲工塲。</p>

<p>製造旣成，於是設法混用，先以一條押給居於陸家浜路百壽坊十號　老太太之婿陳羽，得款分用。半月後又將餘兩條售給在中羣路姚家弄口擺水　　之林志剛，惟此時熊文斌已因他案嫌疑被地檢　拘留，此兩假金條均係時清和所售去。</p>
<p>斯時·警備部第四稽查大隊已據獲密報，有人　造假金條，乃派員多方偵查，獲悉其喜，而時淸和已聞風逃逸。熊文斌在地檢處拘押十三天後，於十二日釋放，十三日深夜十一時即爲第四大隊稽查員在擊嘉路巡道街口捕獲，經帶隊審詢，供認如上不諱，於昨日解送總部依法審辦，在逃之時淸和則在繼續嚴緝中。</p>
<p>本案之物證假金條三條，尚朱吊齊，緣其中一條押予魏太太之婿陳羽，陳不知其僞，又轉押於一名羅少一者。又兩條售與水菓攫販林志剛，林自買進假金條後，水菓攤即不再擺設，或係將多年積蓄購儲金條後，携歸鄉間，若果如此，亦云慘矣。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕南市碼頭恢復委員會，昨午在公用局舉行第七次會議，由趙曾珏主席。據趙局長會後語記者：南市共有碼頭十八座，接收後由公用局分別加以修復應用，現已究成者有一號至四號碼頭，業經於七月七日檢騐完畢，認爲有透氣洞等尚須加以改善。此外五號至九號之碼頭，正積極趕修中，期於八月中旬可告完成。</p>
<p>至於九號以後之碼頭，是否將繼續修理，須俟資金是否充足而後決定，因修築碼頭經費甚爲可觀，全部資金約需一百二十餘億元。若資金敷足，則九號至十三號碼頭，可望於本年年底之前完成。至十三號至十八號之碼頭，則須待明年繼續進行，俟南市之十八座碼頭全部修復應用後，即戰前之原狀已告恢復，南市之繁榮，當可指日而待矣。</p>

<h3>配紗將爲統籌勻配　棉布收買傳聞失實</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕複製工業及棉布商業某負責人，昨日因調節紗布供應實施方案，往見紡調會代理主任委員劉泗英氏，提出意見，並請示政策。聞其所談及者，計有下列數點。</p>
<p>（一）棉紗聯配，數量已有增加。但以前紡建因紗源不旺，限制過嚴，今仍未獲開放，請求爲合理之修正。例如小型廠家數百個單位，紡建因設備小，人手少，辦理分配不易，一直未許參加配紗。九個複製工業公會曾有書面建議，請爲集團承配，未獲報可。其中祗就津帮織廠而言，已有織機約六百台。驅其仰給黑市，有礙調節。再如無錫，常州，吳縣，常熱等地之布廠，甫於前月參加配紗。而本市郊區各廠，迄未受配。亦有失事理之平。劉氐對此，甚表重視。允爲統籌勻配。</p>
<p>（二）代紡代織，原則上已無閒題。但代織辦法，希望能握住重點。花色今星之貨，標準不一，管理不易。如逕爲全面之代織，在政府恐未能如此深入民間，在複製業又有欲罷不能之苦。日來棉布市塲，且因此引起棉布收買之流言。人心不安，於調節原旨有違。請爲明白指示。劉氏對於收買棉布一點，表示政府決不如此做，希轉吿同業安心。關於代織辦法，因事情複雜，允改日再爲詳談。</p>
<p>（三）棉布配售，將爲調節辦法之一環。但現在不比抗戰時期之大後方，地區廣大，客路貫通。普爲直接配售，必難週到。且輔助機構不足，社會調查統計又缺乏。上有所出，未必下有所獲。希望能大處落墨，鄭重出之。劉氏謂投機囤積之風，必須制止。平配實惠，必須直接及於民衆。對於辦法允詳細再談。於原則囑轉吿向業擁護。</p>
<p>（四）調節紗布供應實施方案，關係國家經濟大計，工業生產命脈，商業版賣準則。希望重視複製業及棉布業之意見，以謀官商及產銷之開誠合作。劉氏對此，表示欣快。並鄭重說明，政府爲人民做事，甚願各有關工商業有切實辦法，以資採納。允於日內召集紗布業各負責人，舉行座談，以期集思廣益云。</p>
<h3>人絲上落甚少　廠經綢貨咸疲軟</h3>
<p>昨日人造絲行情無變化，開盤時較疲，終復回高，與上日價相仿。一二〇號高山有光先喊二千七百萬元，不乏乘低價吸收收，乃見上升。中午收盤價七百五十萬元，下午最後做開價爲七百八十萬元。東洋及天橋等價，亦與上日無異。</p>
<p>昨市廠經仍形疲軟，高勻度戰價雖與上日相仿，但乏成交。中級零担有幾担做開，價在三千萬至一百萬元，高級零担三千二百萬元，亦有交易。干經喊價未動，殊無成交。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨因原料低落，且實銷有限，人心異常虛軟，故被面與格子璧縐一致慘降。大誠被面最小到一百四十五萬元，後首稍好，喊五十五萬元賣出。華强被面四十萬元最小價，後首成交大五萬元。大誠格子璧縐開市三萬七千五百元，最後降至六千七百元，隔日期做六千九百元。其餘各貨，俱呈疲軟，華錦縐高檔貨二萬五千元有成交。</p>
<h3>輸廣執委會討論　生絲外銷問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出推廣委員會執委會，於昨日上午，舉行例會，由陳光甫主席。昨日會議席上對生絲之外銷問題，有詳盡之討論，惟尚未獲得結論。今日下午四時起，將繼續召開會議，俾作最後結論云。</p>
<h3>棉市交清價疲</h3>
<p>昨日現棉交易淸稀，市况甚疲，同業因銀根抽緊，更因紗布下瀉，人心頓吿軟弱。昨市紗廠與客帮吸胃轉懈，市上籌碼頓見寬裕，價亦稍回。各檔做開送廠價計歸德二〇七萬。棧交價計靈寶二〇二萬，二二〇萬，二二二萬，二二五萬，二二六萬，二二七萬。歸德一九六萬，二〇三萬，二〇七萬。周浦籽花每擔三四萬五千。</p>
<h3>食米去化不旺　粳秈續見下挫</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧三千五百餘石，市銷呆滯之極，苦無受主，粳秈米續見狂跌二三萬元。白元亦然再跌一二萬元。</p>
<p>麵粉賣氣濃厚，猛挫三四千元，麩皮亦削千元。豆餅去化隨之淸懈，回疲一二千元。營口餅狂落五六千元。黃豆客帮不動，本街看望，轉跌五六千元。</p>
<p>蒃南洋吸胃蟬聯，逐步高翔，盤漲萬元。蠶豆外埠本市去化均呆，來源踵接，續挫三五千元。苞米則北洋略動，挺升三五千元，中次平平。</p>
<p>生仁交易甚少，步跌萬元。芝蔴獨呈挺秀，再漲一二萬元。莞豆平定。</p>
<p>汕市依然漲跌不一，菜油因廣帮止辦，下跌一二萬元。生油豆油甬帮納進，回漲一二萬元。蔴汕平站，淸汕堅挺。</p>
<h3>貼放會核准貸款　總金額八五億元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委員會第十六次例會，於十五日下午三時，在該會會議室舉行。到秦潤卿，潘壽恒，伍克家等十四人。討論申請案件計工業貸款四二件，複議四件，金額一〇八億餘元。通過四四件，金額七三億二千萬元。出口物資申請案件亦通過三件，金額十二億元，總計共核准金額八五億元云。</p>
<h3>小麥貸款原則變更</h3>
<p>一部份粉廠改辦實物貸款</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：醞釀已久之麥貸，原則雖早經確定，惟遲運未獲批准施行。刻聞原定貸款原則，又有變更。茲誌大要如次：</p>
<p>（一）麥貸仍照舊辦理，除第四區麵粉工業公會，福新，茂新，阜豐，華豐，裕通等五大麵粉廠外，其他各廠原定侮日產量一千包者，以貸款十億元爲原則。茲決改辦實物貸款，詳細辦法，有待本週四南京四聯總處會議時，作最後之核定。</p>
<p>（二）政府另辦收購小麥貸款資金三千億元，該項資金，由糧食部委託各區麵粉廠代辦收購小麥。聞三千億元貸款內，福新等五廠，約佔百分之五十以上。</p>
<p>（三）公記辦事處係　新等五廠本身之聯合租織，代理糧食部收購小麥，係屬該處業務之一部份云。</p>
<h3>證券字號登記　經濟部訓令停止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕綴濟部以　蠶上　證劵商業阿業公會資令　　證券存號按其性質，依公司法或商業登記法向社會農聲請登記等語。特訓令市社會局稱：查該公會尚未經本部核准備案，而證劵字號係馬特　營業，除已核准爲上海證劵交易所之經紀人得依公司法或商業登記法辦理登記外。至非證劵交易所之經紀人而經營上項業務者，本部槪未便核准登記，報載各而如果屬實，關於非經紀人之證劵字號應一律停辦登記，仍候妥籌辦法再行飭遵。</p>
<h3>捲烟廣續下跌</h3>
<p>昨日捲烟市况，塲內一片喊賣聲中，買戶　　個望，中途　有見低進取，買意不勁。致市勢狂瀉。午市又聞中華公司亦將派配「全祿　斧」兩牌香烟，市情更呈下游。結果十支大英烟，每箱比上日繼續猛跌四十二萬元，低至八百三十二萬元。老刀烟亦狂挫三十二萬，爲七百十八萬元。五華亦降十餘萬元。其係羣商烟美麗金鼠全祿雙斧白蘭地紅金等條燜價，一致軋降八九百元至二千五百元。五十支茄力克三五牌等聽烟，每聽亦瀉一千五百元至二千五百元。惟美貨馬力斯六根駱駝等條烟，因來源不議，市獨穩固。</p>
<h3>華股過程平穩　永紗初疲後堅</h3>
<p>華股昨頗有參差，永紗日暮途窮，十分平庸。散戶上塲放空，臨收前紛補，初疲後堅，結果現遞榮辱不一。信和美亞受紗證兩集團爭逐，反吿十分俏利，所能亦較多，良以前者贈股數有增加可能也。小型股除新光仍見活勤外，餘股不過穩定而已。雜股新亞所跌最多，餘股升沉不一。整個股市則因銀根初緊後鬆，疲後轉穩。</p>
<p>晨初因國行隔前差進甚巨，人心志忑而開低盤。遞永紗開後，供售頗多，退至九八五〇元。旋雖被拉上至一〇三〇〇元，但一八五號一五六號七六號三六號復賣到一〇一〇〇元。二二三號七一號二一九號一七一號進胃不怠，略多掙扎，八五號七六號六五號一五七號六九號一〇二號又賣到九九五〇元，一七七號八五號一二九號趁低尚納，一一七號雖頻加放空，仍易升爲一一一〇〇元左右，終以一一七號一〇四號一〇二號五〇號一五三號一二號二二三號一六九號之奮售，十一時正遞永紗跌至九七〇〇元。惟即交永紗成交淸稀，低價不過九七〇〇元，後以信和經二二四號一四號一六二號猛納，突吿激昂，美亞由二三一號九一號買進回升亦速，人心尚易轉好，遞永紗由一五七號一〇五號二二三一號一八〇號一七七號一五四號七三號二一八號進至一〇二五〇元。一五七號二二三號一一七號一七二號一度賣小至九九八〇元，二三一號一一七號一八五號一五六號六五號二二三號一四號一五二號一八三號二〇三號紛紛置進，二三〇號並納現永紗，十二時一刻漲到一〇四八〇元及一〇二三〇元高價。經二一八號一六九號八二號二三二號之脫手，一七一號亦供現永紗，回小至一〇二五〇元左右。午收爲一〇三二〇元，收後喊價尚穩。結果較前收計即交股永紗新光勤興微升，中法尚平，華豐景福新華微挫，信和美亞各漲半成强，永公跌半成，新亞跌一成，麗安跌半成，五和內衣稍降，大通水泥統益平平，中絲景車火柴微升，商務榮豐各漲半成左右。滬交股計信和漲起半成强，美亞升半成，新光景福勤興微升，永紗永公華豐微降。塲外各老股大生華商華成等漲起半成，餘尚平穩。</p>
<h3>統債又見回跌　外股榮辱不一</h3>
<p>公債昨以商會，所提公債倍數償還之提案，業遭財部不允所請，人心受當頭棒喝而再跌。惟低後尚有盤頭，統丙晨開六八〇〇元，高價七一〇〇元，低價六五〇〇元，最後以六八〇〇元結束。潤德及五〇三室有供，五五二室三五八室則選，成交約二百萬左右。結果較前　計甲乙丁各跌七百元。統丙降一千元，統戊亦小九百元。</p>
<p>外股昨榮辱不一，怡紗晨開七、而升至七一五〇〇元結束。洋　雖納，金集中人北帮銀行帮所　不多，　　較前收計紙業微升均吿微降。成交不暢，過程遂十〇〇〇〇元，低價六九〇〇〇元分平唐。</p>
<h3>本年首次繅工貸欵　江浙八八億餘元　上海區今晨開始訂立合約</h3>
<p>中國農民銀行舉辦之本年度春繭繅工貸款，江浙兩省第一次貸放估計數額，爲八十八億七千五百七十六萬元，共擁廠商七十七家，計浙江方面廿四家，貸款總額四十一億零八十萬元。無錫四十六家，貸款總額卅四億八千九百零四萬元。蘇州三家，貸款總額六億一千七百廿八萬元。上海四家，貸款總額六億六千八百六十四萬元。</p>
<p>又其中貸款最高額，計八億六千餘萬元，最低計一千五百萬元。又悉：該行對杭州蘇州無錫等地各分行，十五日已發出通知書，即日辦理，上海區定十六日晨開始訂立合約云。</p>
<p>繅絲同業公會定期討論要案</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕第三區繅絲工業同業公會，定於本日下午三時，似銀行俱樂部舉行理監事聯席會議。聞屆時討論案，將集中下述兩項：（一）無錫縣參議會要求撤換該地蠶絲產銷協　會負責人。綠在辦理本年收購春蠶事宜時，該會按照四檐米換繭一擔之比例，決定米價後，熟料收購時米價波動，致蠶農損失頗鉅，現一致要求賠償補貼，並撤換蠶絲協導會駐該縣負責人，擬提付討論解決辦法。</p>
<p>（二）本年春繭代繅廠商，原望當局准予在代繅之生絲內，對本身原有墊款一成，及合法利潤一成，扣折生絲，而實繳繅絲總額之八成。茲該項請求，已遭四聯總處批駁，亦將提付討論解決辦法。</p>
<h3>海關收費增加四倍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕江海關頃公告：自本日起，海關徵收各費，（包括本口雜項費），一律按照現行數額四倍徵收云</p>
<h3>洋莊茶活躍　天宗珍眉外銷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕頃據茶業鉅子朱氏對記者談稱：我國茶葉每年銷往法　麽洛哥一帶，其數向屬可觀，但因國內外售價倒縣不一，致出口久呈疲莫能興之勢。而最近本市法商永興洋行，爲積極展開去路起見，殆已不顧成本，繼續向海外兜售。聞刻下業已向彼地談妥珍眉綠茶九百噸，最遲約於八月中旬交貨。至其價格極爲　吝，每磅僅美金四角七分左右。</p>
<p>〔本報杭州十四日電〕浙茶前以售價不足成本，故產銷停頓，廠商倒閉。茲悉法商永興洋行擬大量運銷洛哥，故市價已提高至四十餘萬元，茶商要求中信局額外再貼補十八萬元已遭失敗，故現趨自由交易。去年存茶旣可銷售，茶商樂觀，故茶廠潮均復業。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕邇來洋莊茶市，除抽珍，珍眉，特貢等綠茶，脫手不衰外，他若低檔紅茶及花香，本市出口商亦多問訊，致過程漸轉活絡，人心步佳，惟交易則在執貨者一意堅持中，依然寥落。至於各種內銷茶，去化均尚蟬聯，市勢巍站有動，前途繼續看好。</p>
<h3>金菜步降</h3>
<p>新金針菜登塲以來，因陸續有到，而去胃反稀，價遂步鬆。前開一百二三十萬元之貨現市不上九十萬元，跌百分之三十强。</p>
<p>買戶觀望多頭吐售　棉紗布一致狂瀉　四二支藍鳳進二千萬關</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因市上銀根忽趨緊俏，塲內買戶觀望，多頭吐售接踵，又聞申新廠有二十支雙馬紗開出，人心頓呈虛怯，行情賡續下游。迨至最後，四十二支藍鳳紗跌進二千萬關，低至一千八百七十萬元，比上日狂瀉一百五十萬元。廿支特雙馬亦步小至一千二百萬元，價挫八十萬元。雙馬紗爲一千零九十萬，亦跌八十萬元。其餘十六支光明天女十支童十軍，及卅二支藍鳳銀月等粗細紗，一致下挫二三十萬至百餘萬元不一。</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，亦因銀根緊迫，業外大戶拋售，一般浮多更以當局澈查倉庫頗嚴，致皮球貨細布狂挫二三萬元，兼以紡建公司售布之期，籌碼尤多，在塲上供多求少之下，市氣益臻萎靡，結果十二磅龍頭五福藍鷄陽鶴等細布，一致在瀉一萬七八千至二萬五千元。漂布及元嗶嘰價亦軋降一萬餘元，惟深色布藍布及士林布等市仍穩固。</p>
<h3>紡建售布</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共一〇一二〇疋，申購單共三〇九張。內廠商十八戶，購布一三二〇疋。布號二九一張，購布八八〇〇疋。</p>
<h3>肥皂賣多價降</h3>
<p>昨日用品市盤下挫甚烈，初開黃祥茂皂價喊三十四萬，缺乏受主，午收時賣氣更濃，低至三十三萬五千元，稍有同業互做交易。午市交易更形閑散，結果祥茂皂低至三十二萬五千元，比上日下挫一萬六千元。固本皂亦步小至四十七萬，軋降二萬元。箭刀皂降一萬五千元，爲四十六萬元。其餘光華牛牌鼎豐等皂，一致下挫五千至四萬五千元。</p>
<p>火柴市面亦下挫，交易異常淸稀，美麗鳳凰南京寗波等牌，俱見下降二萬至四萬元不等。</p>
<h3>政府收購出口物資　決未過份抑價</h3>
<p>出口商常不願提示實際成本</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央信託局代理政府收購桐油猪鬃後，本市出口界一般觀感，有認爲所訂收購價格過低。同時希望二點：（一）在國內收購時，勿在產區收購。（二）外銷時仍望委託或轉售予各出口商，再由出口商辦理出口，俾維持一般出口業者之業務經營。</p>
<p>記者昨曾以此事徵詢中信局某負責人意見，渠稱；中信局此次秉承政府命令，代理收購桐油猪鬃本身對收購事宜，決無任何主見。其收購價格，悉由收購出口物資審價委員會，侮日根據各地確實報價，愼密會商決定，故決無過份抑低之情事。矧國家行局對出口物價在國內外之運銷無不竭力予以資金之便利。例如出口商在產區收購時，可先辦承兌，出口物資在遝往各出口物資集散地時，又可辦理押匯，外銷時又可辦理打包貸款。故出口物資運銷過程所運用之資金，謂其全部爲國家行局所供給，亦不爲過。而一般出口商，均不願提供出口物資之實際成本。即因資金轉週不便，亟待收購融通時，亦堅特須照市價爲準。否則，即持貨不售，以圖匯率偶有變更時，再外銷獲取暴利。故渠甚望各出口商能就過去運用政府資金之觀點出發，則對目前政府所訂之收購價格，自不能目爲不合理。至出口商所提由出口商代理外銷之意見兩點，中信局極願考慮，刻正由關係方面計議中云。</p>

<h3>鎮安血案內幕　縣長犯法判死刑</h3>
<p>— 本報記者麥葉</p>
<p>西安九日航訊</p>
<p>五條人命大慘劇</p>
<p>「縣長通知各機關：據報近日城內有共黨十餘人從事活動，即晚戒嚴。」……『縣長說縣內共產民盟份子甚多，你們須得小心注意。』……『下午五時左右，街上佈下崗了，一個人都走不動。』……『加崗滿街，縣長衛士都穿了便衣。』……『縣長通知衛士等在縣城周圍佈置機鎗，又令城內打槍，不許動，不准來往人。』……（這中心人物就是當時陝南鎭安縣長孫濬伯。其時爲五月一日。）</p>
<p>漏綱之影在法庭上，孫濬伯先高談「革命一，繼述奧王女戀愛經過。結論：「如判余有罪，余必當庭自殺。」孫始終拒絕任何人拍照，加以庭內甚暗，此爲唯一之「漏網之影」，由記者設法攝得者。（本報記者麥葉攝寄）</p>
<p>緊張鏡頭同時，在『（鎭安縣參議長）李維翰住宅四週佈置武裝崗警』，「議長（幾個動務先後（由家中）出門觀望，均被縣長衛士禁止行動」，「有參議員朱本濂由李家出，亦被禁於門口」，「縣長對他三個衛士說，呌這四個（禁在議長門口的）人不許動，如動，拿槍打！」………</p>
<p>另一個鏡頭：「議長（在屋裏）吃過飯，拿一根紙烟，向街道遊玩，剛到了門口，聽見縣長的衛士說：「不要動，縣長的命令！」接着縣長來了，打議長兩個耳光子，縣長就打了一槍，說「你們（指衛士）爲什麼不開鎗？」議長向後跑，在後門跟前就流一堆血，到菜園子就倒下來了。』這時，『四面衛士亂打槍。』『縣長槍聲一發，而四圍齊響，宛若一呼百應。』被禁在門前四個人中一側勤務名呌張東成的被打死了，參議員「朱本濂左腿中彈逃避於民宅，幸全生命。」「（議長）勤務王德坤（由家裏）逃跑至南門外里許，縣長命人追上槍斃。」……</p>
<p>還有，當時「縣參議會秘書萬武英於會內聞槍聲四起，又見警兵蜂擁而入，遂逃於某民居，縣長又令警察局長帶警赴萬宅搜捕未獲，復遍搜民宅，終將萬秘書捕獲，網綁至縣府，旋又拉至李議長住宅。晚九時許，縣長令拉（萬）至議李長屍旁槍斃！」</p>
<p>四死一傷</p>
<p>——四死一傷的鎭安血案就是這樣發生的。在久已乎麻木於斫斫殺殺新聞的耳朶，四條命或許還不够「刺激」，「孫沉睡伯身爲縣長，負有督導民治之責，應如何尊重民意，以期奠定行憲　礎，乃竟利用職權，槍殺民意機關首長李維翰，及秘書萬武英等四人，依法應予加重論利。」判決　上這幾句警句還可借用法官徐志遠氏的感慨話來補充：「此血案發生，不獲受刑者私人之不幸，抑亦凖備行憲聲中國家之不幸！」故其罪行的惡性，其背景，其溫床，其條件，甚至其敎講，都値得重視。</p>
<p>多角軋礫</p>
<p>當然，這案件的哄動處而實際又是血案發生的導火綫，在於還有一個廿六歲女敎師王慧敏，孫說他與她「結婚」是合法，但觀「禮」在塲者郤說不過宣告同居，而法官在起訴書和判決書上用着更明顯的字眼：「强姦」。不管怎麽也罷，她在縣府裏「同居」了兩個月就服毒死於縣府，替這一齣時代悲劇添加一塲「性悲劇」。但這揷曲並非由她個人獨脚主演。有如曹禺「日出」裏金八存在而不出塲，露靈或王　敏的看　戕生，分明都是出於被逼。在法庭內外，我們聽够了一方面駡官僚政治，那方面咒土劣歹糾；爲父母的怨人家毒死咱閨女，爲「婿」的却諷刺「岳丈」想出費女兒，甚至姑娘死了還想敞八億元這麽一筆。事情經過儘管複雜而微妙，但綜合起來，也不外乎官與紳之間的衝突，再加上威力同樣無限的父權與「夫」權之間的多角軋礫。於是呼連她在內，五條人命作了無言的犧牲！</p>
<p>性犯罪案變質</p>
<p>這本來充其量不過是一件性犯罪案，却很快就變質了。因其時鎭安有人用各種名義向陝省府揭發孫的貪汚不法；另一件案子說孫曾强迫汪小蘭與賈子山離婚；而王慧敏的父親亦向法院控孫和樊氏夫婦誘略殺人。這幾件案子揉在一起，果然相當動人聽聞。又由於鎮安縣參議會和該縣的省參議員在外一致的揭露孫的行爲；而汪賣離婚係孫的壓迫這一證明文件，據說又是李議長强迫證人劃押的，孫由此深恨參議會和他作對的幾個中心人物了。</p>
<p>殺人圈套</p>
<p>四月底，省府答應鎭安參議會的請求，特派專員馬卓然去鎭安實地密查。假如他辦得好，事情必不致如此惡化。不料他還未進縣境，孫縣長就曉得了特派專人出城恭迎，到城裏又派人名爲保護，實則監視，並且每晚去晤談，對馬加以挑撥煽動。孫很巧妙的說：「李議長要謀刺你馬專員」，誰料馬果然入孫圈套，變爲一起的仇視李議長和萬秘書？事至如此，「孫濬伯認馬可助己殺人之謀，已更積極。』先於四月卅日揑造戒嚴，以爲殺人之準備。翌日下午五時，孫與馬一同去找議長，孫在李宅門前朝着議長打的第一槍，馬視察亦在塲的。法官判馬爲共同殺人犯，就在這幾點。孫之當日下午行事，當然是因爲那天午刻接到省府民廳因案停職候訊這電報，刺激所致。</p>
<p>私行鐐押</p>
<p>女主角　王慧敏到鎮安</p>
<p>王慧敏本來在西安，孫濬伯供說是他十年戀人，她於今年十二月間去鎭安，係應約前住「結婚」。當時，她父母對這婚事，似也並不澈底反對，祗主張「保留條件」。這兩點不很重要，几事後亦均無確鑿證據，不過其間却插進樊味世及其妻張天貞這兩個角色進來。樊是當時鎭安青年團分團籌備主任，他寫信託其妻交與王慧敏，說留下女靑年股長一缺，呌王到鎭安來。信裏說：「孫縣長爲己同學，感情非常融洽，自己等於第二個老爺，呼風喚雨，沒有辦不到的事。」「鎭安將成爲我們的樂園。」</p>
<p>王果然一起的隨孫回鎭安，行前在西安購辦結婚用品，但偏偏忘記了買結婚書！到達了，「這女人頭一天來就在縣長一處睡，衛士說縣長將太太接來了」（伙伙供詞）。隔一天舉行「婚禮」，法官後來認爲不合法的婚禮。可憐這位縣長「太太」從此「不自由出去」；「臥室門即有衛士」；外間寄給「太太」的信『必先交衛士，收發員不得進去』。這樣拖下去兩個月，這位「一品夫人』（孫之辯護律師的諷刺語）終由呑服毒藥自殺了！究竟是自服？抑逼服？目前還無證據。法官斬釘截鐵的下判：『其服毒，實導源於强姦，因而羞憤自殺，至堪認定。』更可憐的是女兒死了在鎭安，而　在鼓裏的爸爸還寫信去呌她回西安舉行婚禮！</p>
<p>另一件小事，亦可看出孫的性格：血案發生前一天，鎮安電報局員送一封來自西安而似有　語的電報給李議長，孫就把這送報人鐐押起來，押了十多天。這是檢察官控孫除了殺人，略姦致死以外的第三項罪名：私行拘禁，奪人自由。</p>
<p>孫濬伯揚言　「判死刑當自殺」聞判並不絕食却想偷生</p>
<p>經過一次質詢庭和三次辯論庭，西安地方法院於本月七日如此宣判：「孫濬伯假借職務上之權力，共同殺人處死刑，褫奪公權終身。又假借職務上之權力，强姦因而致被害人羞憤自殺（按指王慧敏之死），處有期徒刑十二年，褫奪公權十年。又假借職務上之權力私行拘禁剝奪人之行動自由（按指電信局員之拘押），處有期徒刑一年，應執行死刑，褫奪公權終身。楊緒堂楊保君（此二人均孫之衛士）共同殺人，處死刑，褫奪公權終身。馬卓然（省府視察），羅珍，張志忠（此二人亦係孫之衛士）共同殺人，各處有期徒刑十年，褫奪公權十年。樊味世（鎭安靑年團籌備主任）共同意　使婦女爲姦淫而略誘，處有期徒刑三年，褫奪公權三年。張天貞（樊之妻）韓世均無罪。卜郎尼手槍一枝，子彈十五粒沒收。」</p>
<p>孫在法庭上受詢時，曾揚言「如判我有罪，我必當庭自殺。」態度倔强，居然嚇得原告辯護律師全體拂袖退庭。宣判那大，他沒有出庭。他在獄中對記者訴寃，還說他必絕食以謝國人。但事實上他並未完全絕食，不過在歇斯特里狀態下胃口激减，他在準備上訴，以求一「生」呢！</p>
<p>不管王慧敏之父爲人如何，記者認爲他這句話是相當客　：「鎮安血案如何判處，已經不是我能否替女兒伸冤的私人問題。它實在是法治精神與官僚政治　者間的試金石。」</p>

<h3>聯合國兩年工作新檢討</h3>
<p>七月八日　滬聯譯</p>
<p>世界變幻迅速，幾乎每天都有地圖上某一地點的新發展，成爲報章的大標題，尤其是一九四五年六月廿六日，聯合國憲章在舊金山簽訂和日本行將降伏以來的兩年間爲然。茲乘現代史加上新記錄之前，特檢討兩年來的重要發展，這種檢討工作，必須照聯合國的組織與成長，依次而進，因爲聯合國乃是負責處理當代極追切問題的國際機關。</p>
<p>導言</p>
<p>有史以來，從沒有一個國際組織，其規模與範圍有聯合國的龐大者，憲章草定的龐大機構，現已形成，並在工作中，其已進行的國際討論，數目之多，可說空前米有，祗是紐約一地，過去一年來舉行的會議已在二千次以上，這種事實的本身，或許便是聯合國的首要成就——得使各國政治家當面討諭他們的問題，而世人便是他們的聽衆。</p>
<p>然而世人要求更具體的結果，固是情理之常，兩年祗是短促的時期，在歷史上不過轉瞬間而已，但世人的需求極迫切，因爲人類已臨其命運的緊急關頭，人類命運所繫的重大決定，已不容或緩。</p>
<p>聯合國的成立，乃要達成多方面的目標，套用習語，可以說這各個主權國集體組織的任務，是在拯救人類，使生活有價値。像憲章第一條所訂明者，這些目標是；維持國際和平及安全，發展國際間友好關係；促成國際合作，以解決國際間屬於經濟，社會，文化及人類福利性質的問題；以及成爲協調各國行動的中心，以達成共同目的。</p>
<p>聯合國在不足兩年的時期中。爲要達成這些目的，究竟已有些什麼工作？如要檢討工作業已開始或迅將發動的每一種任務，勢不可能，但是下文可表明這組織所負主要責任，至今已獲得的成果。</p>
<p>安全理事會處理的</p>
<p>第一項重大事件</p>
<p>便是伊朗問題，伊朗政府向安理會申訴，指蘇聯干涉其內政並違背一九四二年同盟條約，駐軍伊朗領土，又說這種情勢，或將引起國際摩擦。安理會在一九四六年一月十九日提出這問題，先後在倫敦和紐約加以討論。眞到伊朗報告蘇軍已經撤退，安理會才在一九四六年五月廿二日停止討論此事，但現在還「保持此問題」。</p>
<p>幾天之後，安理會開始工作，蘇聯將希臘局勢提請安理會注意，說英軍繼續駐在希臘，便有干涉該國內政之意。安理會兩度會議，討論此事後，又見常事國雙方發表聲明，表示意見，便認爲此事已告結束。</p>
<p>一九四六年八月，希臘局勢又成問題，因烏克蘭向安理會申訴，說希臘政府政策，威脅和平，安理會會議十二次，繼續討論是項申訴，但所提出的四件決議案，都在九月二十日被否決，於是將此問題，從安理會議程剔出。</p>
<p>一九四六年十二月，希臘問題又在安理會提出，這次是希臘政府發動，指希臘的鄰國——阿爾巴尼亞，保加利亞，南斯拉夫—援助希臘北部的游擊隊激烈作戰，因而危害公共秩序和希臘的領土主權。安理會經過長久討論，有幾次辯論激烈，才於十二月十九日一致議決，設置巴爾幹調查委員會，以斷定有關希臘和其他三國邊境一帶侵犯之說的事實。　（待續）</p>

<h3>赫德生傳的新資料</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>英國生物學家兼文學家的赫德生（William　Henry　Hudson）死於一九二二年。他的兒時都消磨在南美的大平原上。他在那兒研究特區動物和植物。一八八五年他寫過兩卷本的小說「紫地」（The　Purple　Land）一八九二年他又寫「博物學家在拉巴拉他」（The　Naturalist　at　La　Plata）（按該地在阿根廷）。他的名著就是「綠邸：熱帶林的傳奇」（GreenMansilnsi　A　Romance　of　the　Tropical　Forest）（按此書有近代叢書本）說到他對於鳥獸的智識和塞爾特人的魔衡。一九二五年首相包爾溫在海德公園爲他建了一個鳥的聖地以作紀念，並有愛普斯坦因（J．Epstein）爲他塑了一個象徵的雕像。</p>
<p>在赫德生的著作中，存在着矛盾。他的著作所顯示的傳記部分，同時可以說是很多，又可以說是很少。他的每一部書都有自傳的章節，常害着懷鄉症，回想起多年以前的鳥鳴，或者南美大平原上無窮盡的歲月。但這些回憶是沒有時間性的；它們與”曆無關，可以屬於一長串時間中任何一個黎明或夏季。赫德生同時是豐富，又是吝嗇；他的回憶是生動而迷人的，這是豐富；他的事件沒有確定的地點，這是吝嗇。</p>
<p>赫德生的書簡很少寫上年月。他的朋友們也沒有能够知道他的生年的。他在晚年似乎專心致力於他所熱愛的大地之美麗，要想把時間的經過忘記掉。結果，他過去的事件都成爲秘密。爲他作傳的朋友那泊茨（Morley　Roberts）只好猜測他從生地到英去的年代，結果還是猜錯了四年。在赫德生的傳記中是有不少失去的年月和空白的。</p>
<p>赫德生從少年時代到成人，時間大約是一八六〇年左右，當時他住在阿根廷。當他從南美到英國去，則爲一八八〇年，其間他曾到巴塔哥尼亞去過。我們如果不怕麻煩，可以在史密斯生尼亞博物館（Smitbsonian　Mlstituiton）找到年報，有一個確切的年代，一八六六，赫德生曾在這一年到倍諾斯·愛勒（BuenosAyres）去採集過標本。三年後，赫德生曾交納鳥皮，一入七〇年以後，便不見記載了。</p>
<p>第二次大戰後，有人訪問史密斯生尼亞博物館的書記魏特摩（A．Wetmore）博士，他說起在案卷堆裘找到八封信，其中有六封是赫德生寫的，這些信已經理藏了八十年之久，現在方纔得見天日。</p>
<p>一八六五年聖誕後兩天倍諾斯愛勒的美國執政官海爾潑（Hinton　Rowan　Helper）寫了一封信給該館的白爾德（S．F．Baird）博士，當時是該館的助理書記介紹年輕的赫德生給他，當時他是二十五歲，由此我們知道，赫德生的生年該是一八四一年，他活了八十三歲。海爾潑也是當時的名人，他所著的反對里奴制度的「迫切的危機」（The　Lmpending　Crisis），在一八五七年出版，銷行頗廣。他的信上大意說：「赫德生是一個愛美的鳥類學者，願被僱採集鳥類，他自己說，可以使得任何僱用他的人滿意，我相信他的話。他說，他曾自己採集着玩，還不曾爲公家服務過。他願爲貴館或任何博物館，美國或任何處服務。我願做兩方面忠實的介紹人。」</p>
<p>白爾德的覆信說起他「想看一看赫德生所搜集的鳥類，並顫帮助他排列。」他指出哪些小鳥可引起最大的科學興味，發信的日子是一八六六年二月二日。</p>
<p>一年多以後，赫德生的覆信纔達到白爾德手中，時爲一八六七年二月十二日，信是在上年九月五日寫的，地點是康契塔斯（Conchhas），距倍諾斯愛勒約十二里，他就是在那兒生長的，十六歲時又曾在該地住過。從新發現的信中，我們知道赫德生十六歲左右曾在那兒住過的。</p>
<p>赫德生的六封信中，要算第一封最長，也最有興味，大意說：「海爾潑先生把　給他的信給我看，要我搜集鳥類，本來我希望在九月以前能有二三百種標太，但是我失望了；我想搜集的冬天的鳥，在這一季長很少的。我跋涉了許多里路，一種標本也不曾找到。我所送呈的鳥還是我以前所採集的，大都生物學家都知道的。打夏天的鳥又太早，我想兩三星期內不會採集到什麽，所以只好把我僅有的一些呈上了。我不相信這些東西送到你面前會完全無損，因爲我沒有這種工作的經騐；不過即使損失，也許不會太多，在你下次信到時，我希望有更多的標本寄給你。我想設法得到駝鳥蛋和一盒蝸半殼，這　在這城中我相信只有四種。因爲你不曾提起要寫鳥名，我只把每種的雌雄註出，就在包紮紙的邊上；但你如需要，將來每一種我都可以做一個說明，加上它的習性。這些鳥都是我在倍諾斯愛勒城八里以內用槍打中的。您說小鳥最好，合於科學之用。我只要仔細搜尋，可以在沿河的澤林農找到不少，都是很小的家鳥，有些恐怕還是以前所從未知道過的。你一定知道倍諾斯愛勒的地理狀態，這是一個寬廣的幾乎沒有樹的平原，寒冷的冬天的風吹來，或焦灼的夏天的風來臨，鳥獸都沒有遮敝的地方。所以這地方不適宜於採集，純粹爲了摯愛自然的原故，我希望能換一個地方。我將用我全部的時間來追求這個工作。除鳥類外，如化石，昆蟲，草類等，也是我所願意採集的。」</p>
<p>赫德生說阿根廷只有四種蝸牛，其實將近有四百種。他的第二封信時期是一八六七年六月，說起紙盒內有「黑鳥」，與鳥皮同寄。他希望白爾德仔細考察一下；他確信這是前所未發見的新標本。九個月過去了。在他的第四封信裘，（地點仍是康契塔斯，日子是一八六八年三月十五日）我們聽到赫德生失望的呼聲。白爾德的覆信裘沒有一個字提到他的黑鳥。赫德生說起，倍諾斯愛勒自然史博物館館長博密斯脫（Burmeister）博士「很想知道您替這黑鳥題一個什麼名字」。大約赫德生很希望能題上他自己的名字吧。</p>
<p>二十五年後，赫德生開始寫他的「巴塔哥尼亞閒散的日子」（Idle　Days　in　Patagonia），回想起他那南美獵鳥的夢：「我希望找到新的標本，比方說，一種美麗的鳥，例如歪頸鳥，麥耳鳥之類，但這種鳥必須是人類的眼睛從未見過，也不曾被人題過名字的。我不知道別的鳥類學者是否有這樣大的熟情；至於我自已，却是連夜間做夢也夢見一種新的鳥，活躍地被我看見；這樣夢的對於我是美麗的，醒來常感到憂愁。這夢中的鳥每每是灰色的，棕色的或別的穩重的色彩」。</p>
<p>在這節文字裏我們聽到詩人感情加快的聲音。那末，信中失望的情緒也可想而知了。現在我們知道這種黑鳥是阿根廷的牧鳥，學名呌做Molothrus　rufoaxillaris這是美國一位科學家發見的，他發見這鳥只比赫德生早幾個月，致使赫德生不能早日實現他的夢想。直到幾年以後，他在巴塔哥尼亞，採集了一種驚鳥，居然用了他的名字，呌做Cnipolegns　hudsoni。</p>
<p>在史密斯生尼亞博物館裏還保留着不少赫德生在一八六六年左右所採集的鳥類，人家一看就可以看出哪一種是赫德生採集的。因爲別人的都是腿朝後，他却是把腿放向前面的。</p>
<p>赫德生第四信中提起他附寄一張照片，遭照片也是從未發表過的。</p>
<p>離開康契塔斯是赫德生最高的願望，這在他給史密斯生尼亞博物館的四封信中可以知道。一八六七年六月，他說：「倘若我留在家裏，將不能有完全的採集」。次年三月，他報告道：「也許我要離開康契塔斯」。一八六八年六月三日，他的心裏已經決定了。最後一信他說！「現在我爲雜務所擾，未能專心採集。但仍懷着願望，不久我可以用我全部的時間來追逐我所喜悅的學問。自然，我要離開康契塔斯，因爲這兒再也找不到更新的標本子了」。</p>
<p>除巴塔哥尼亞外，我們不知道赫德生曾經旅行到什麼地方去過。一八六八年後　幕又垂下來了。但在一八六五年十二月到一八六八年六月這兩年多時間，因博物館書信的發現，這幕又升了起來，我們知道赫德生採集鳥頹標本這一時期；他的希望，計畫和以前闕疑的部分全都知道了。</p>

<h3>床</h3>
<p>— 王德雲</p>
<p>生活給你疲勞，床給你憇息；生活給你苦痛，床給你慰藉；生活給你現實的醜惡，床呢，他却給你夢幻的美麗。</p>
<p>「深夜捫心」是在夜半三更，當你睡在床上的時候；雪夜擁被讀書，是何等的樂趣，也是當你睡在床上的時候；「小樓一夜聽風雨」更描繪出榻上詩人的雅典；「床前明月光」，使人牽動鄉愁，尤其不勝低徊呵。</p>
<p>床：雨天的窗，烈日下的傘，生活的褓姆，病者的母親。</p>
<p>遠大的思想和眞理，是精神的寄託處；床則是困乏的肉體的寄託處；他給你溯憶，省察，智　，更予你新生，快樂和安慰。</p>
<p>職是之故，一個困倦的肉體，固需要牀；一個不健康的歪曲的思想，更需要精神的床的調養和治理。</p>
<p>人生不能離開床，床和人生的關係是太密切了，人生差不多有一半的時間是交付給床的，雖然夢　是在床上發生的，但，人問的世相，其恐怖誠尤甚於夢　；雖然昔人曾作豪語說，大丈夫當馬革裹屍，應死於戰塲而不應死於床上，其實，他所指的「馬革」和「戰塲」，也是「床」，不過是更崇高更偉大的一種寄託處而已。</p>
<p>我以爲人們眞性情眞面目的流露，莫過於酣睡一榻的時候了。白天是矯揉做作的，虛僞的，（所以魯迅「在夜間作夜頌」）夜則是暴露的，眞率的，一個人的日常生活是旣繁瑣而又脆詐，祗有當你帶着滿身心的苦倦和失望歸來躺在牀上的時候，這時候，你就可不必再展開你「處世」的手腕，再拘泥謹愼些什麽了，你可以自由自在地舒散一下你的身心，恣意地肆無忌憚，放浪形骸了。雖也有人認爲人們的睡態是可憎的，其實廬山面貌，或尚不失爲可愛吧？夢　亦復如是，誰能相信白天冠冕堂皇的談話，比午夜的夢藝更爲眞實一些呢？</p>
<p>眞的，有床的人是有福的，朋友，當你悠然抽上一枝烟，靜臥在舒適的席夢思上的時侯，你可曾想到過披星戴月，餐霜飲露的流浪人？</p>

<p>確然，他向「〇四」借了一柄手槍，從協和醫院病室走川之後，給我們寫的那封信上，說是要去復仇，殺日本鬼子。最後我們所探到的消息，說他衝出西直門去了。同時，另一方面的消息，說倭軍也正在那時候，在西使門外與我軍作戰。當時據我們的推斷，認爲他準定犧牲了。</p>
<p>「鼎元兄」，我壓住了情緒；「您怎麽也到這裏來了？」</p>
<p>「那是一段神仙故事，—一位活神仙把我給點化了！」悲痛的語調裏，還保留着一絲絲幽默意味。</p>
<p>他從醫院裏溜出之後，聽見西城外，砲火暄天，他知道日寇正在那裏耀武揚威。他沒有進一步考慮，坐上一部「洋車」，呌車夫向西跑。快到西便門，車子過不去了；駐防軍正在那專集合，預備衝出城，和打接應的軍隊，聯合起來，殺開一條血路，突圍而去；留在城裏，就得被俘了。</p>
<p>跟軍軍隊跑的老百姓，只有他一人。帶病的身體，追不上軍隊；雖也跑了幾里路，氣力接不上，在路旁暈倒了。等到醒轉來，只覺到有一雙手在他頭上按摩着，逐漸地他發見睡的地方，不像醫院，也不像平常住室。這裏有神座，有長命燈，有鐘，有　；雖然燈光昏暗，看不淸四壁，意想裏他猜得出這是小小的廟堂。尤其可以證實的，他發現那正在替他按摩的人，是個老道。</p>
<p>他同老道問答了幾句，才知道他暈過去已經三四個鐘頭了。老道發現他有病，才招呼人把他抬到觀裏—三淸觀—一個小型的窮道觀。觀裏只有一個老道和一個老香火。老道說他略通脈訣，替他切過脈，知道他病後失調，只要養息幾天，就可無事。</p>
<p>兩天之後，老道告訴他城裏城外，暫時可以太平無事；北平，給日人控制了，只要不「反抗」，就無危險。他沒有對老道保留秘密，把自己的經過和全家大小六七口慘死的情形，都告訴了老道，並且說；「自己這個病軀，活着無益，怎麼也得拼去這條命殺幾個鬼子，替自己的妻室兒女的報仇」。</p>
<p>老道却另有一套哲學思想：「這是刧數，『在數難逃』。…可是『好死不如　活！』…至於報仇，如其帶病報仇，不如且等身體復原了再說…况且三淸老爺（李老君）不主張報仇，可也不許妖魔鬼怪橫行無道；所以老爺座下有二郞神，專管　魔除怪；不如求個籤，看三淸老爺和二郎神的主張，比較有把握…」</p>

<h3>制止「學店」橫征勒索</h3>
<p>— 十朗</p>
<p>前兩天，市敎育局把經濟公開的小學名單，披露在報紙上，這是一種聲明的舉措，値得各方效法；但這僅僅是一種消極的　揚，在積極方面，敎育當局應更戰厲地公布經濟不公開各學校的名單，使他們有　警愼；更重要的，應該由敎育當局派員監督，稽核校款，才能澈底澄淸上海各學校經濟嚴自混亂的情况。</p>
<p>以十六區中心國民學校小學生檢舉學校當局爲例子，他們透露出以下數點：</p>
<p>（一）上華期尚未結束，即須繳納下學期費用；（二）若不繳納，以開除學籍爲要挾；（三）對學生近乎勒索地征收。募捐各種費用；（四）虛設名目，强征勒索各種建築費，書籍費等等。</p>
<p>這種「學店」式的風氣，必須聯合敎育局，參議會，地方公正人士，聯合舉辦一次「淸潔」的大檢查，它的步驟，至少應採取下列數端：</p>
<p>（一）准許大中小學生，提出證據及事實，檢舉告發。</p>
<p>（二）准許家長列舉橫征强索各種不合理費用的項目及數字。</p>
<p>（三）准許敎職員列舉學校當局尅扣　餉，及一切校政的黑暗面。</p>
<p>僅由敎部公布下學期中小學雜費繳納規定的一紙公文，不足以洗刷現在公私立大中小學校的各種「陋規」；也不足以洗刷一般家長對子女入學繳納費用的疑懼心理。</p>
<p>敎育當局應刻不容緩地展開學校淸潔運動，務使全上海學校入於正常合理的狀態！</p>

<h3>何以解憂？</h3>
<p>— 明森譯　美國E.狄克德作</p>
<p>差不多無論哪一個人，有時候都要鬱鬱不樂。</p>
<p>要解除要或減輕這種週期性的無名憂悒，最需要的是「自律克已」的自我訓練；其次是理解——明白實情。</p>
<p>第一，你得由衷地決定：你實實在在要克服這種憂抑的情緒。第二，你得明白這種憂鬱是常情而非變態——幾乎每一個人都有的。科學家已經探明了，高興的情緒和消沉的情緒是有一定的週期性的。情緒上的高潮和低潮，可以製成循環的圖表，且正確地預言下次的「憂抑期」來到的日子。病態的憂鬱頽唐，也是這種自然的循環惡化而成的。</p>
<p>雖說憂鬱不樂是自然地週期發生的常情，不過你也可設法加以解除或减輕。爲要消除這種憂抑，可把所有的人分爲兩大類，你自己必可歸入其中的一類：要末你必須正面你的憂鬱，探明其原因而用行動來對付它——要末你必須逃避它，用別的活動來把它驅逐出你的腦海。</p>
<p>在覺得不易自認過失的人，「逃避」大抵是値得採用的方法。至於別的人，如果逃避了現實，要覺得負疚於心的。</p>
<p>要斷定你自己究竟屬於哪一類人，可嘗試回答如下的這些問題：「你眞正暗自承認你的缺點嗎？你能够作誠懇的自我批判嗎？」如果你能够做到這些事的，那末你的最可滿意的辦法，該是正面你的憂鬱的原因，而用行動去消滅它們。如果你的答案是否定的，那末你恐怕還是設法來逃避你那些不時發作的憂悒或怨恨情緒的好。</p>
<p>「明白實情」是應付憂鬱的必要手續。比如你仔細探索內心負疚的原因，也許會發見是由於你曾答應過帶妻兒們去遊玩，却沒有實行，在這樣的塲合，你就應該在今晚或最近的一個例假日帶她們去暢遊一番。承認了你的過失，且加以改正，你就可消除那種內疚。</p>
<p>不過有時候，你的憂鬱的成因也許是除了探明它們之外，你毫無辦法加以立刻更改的外界情形——那末，你可採用一種「代替的校正法」。例如，你是一個婦女，人家沒有邀請你去參加一個園藝俱樂部，因而你覺得失意而　　不樂，這有什麼辦法呢？你可想法來替代：爲你家裏的人們燒一頓特別好吃的小菜，以證明你不是低能的。更好的補救法是：着手去栽培本地最出色的奇花異卉。或是跟知己的朋友們討論你的問題。千萬不要去求人同情你。只有賢明的商量，會帮助你看出來：有過像你這樣的感觸的，原來不止你一人。</p>
<p>憂抑的「低潮」襲來時，是不難認淸的。如果你是一個不得不逃避的人，你應儘量避免去想到那煩惱你的問題，而把心思轉用在你心愛而且擅長的什麼活動上。用勁去做它——不管這是一種遊戲比賽，閱讀盡報，艱難的工作，或是睡覺。</p>
<p>我認識的一位主婦，已經明白了「努力於家務可驅除我的任何心事。」她在情緒上的低潮襲來時，就努力淸掃屋子，整理房間，洗滌一切。</p>
<p>我認識的另一個婦人，其治疫法恰恰相反。她說：「當我心情惡劣時，我要離開家里，改換一下環境！看電影去，看商店的窗　去。我把自已沉沒在外物中間，忘記了自己的煩惱。」</p>
<p>我還認識一個男子，他是用睡眠來度過他的「憂抑期」的，有如一個醉漢在酒後那樣。</p>
<p>究竟用什麽方法來逃避你的憂抑，似乎是無關緊要的—只要它能使你全神貫注就得了。</p>
<p>我還要介紹一樣東西！「憂鬱日記」，當你下次覺得心情不好時，你就開始記這種日記，以後也每次搬織紀戴。先記你的蓬抑情緒　來時的日期，次記你感覺得怎謀，你斷定它的近　和　因是什麼，並且你怎綴來治好它。</p>
<p>這種的日記會成爲一種記錄，如在憂抑的時期拿出來重　一　，會使你記起以前你也心情道麽惡劣過而終於越過了它的。它又會指示你，哪些治法是有效的，哪些是無效的。而且把你的憂鬱寫了出來，也會帮助你忘却它。</p>

<h3>在日本的麥帥</h3>
<p>— 鮑鐘祺</p>
<p>從日本人的眼光中看來，裏克沃塞已被認爲日本新民主的象徵，是活的上帝。他們以爲今日所得到的一切權利，都是麥帥一人所賜與的，爲了表示他們的謝意，千萬個日本人寫信給麥帥，感謝他的食物，保護和民主。</p>
<p>麥帥在東京不大露面，即使連軍隊也不常檢閱，所以，不但日本人不易見到他，速他的部下也是如此。在美軍總部的門外，往往有很多的美兵和日本人拿着照相機想攝得麥帥的一個鏡頭，但是憲兵和警察使他們難以接近。</p>
<p>麥帥每日七時起身，八時進餐，然後消耗大部分時間於閱讀書籍，至十一時赴美軍總部辦公，在這裏，他經常地批閱着重要的文件和那些日本人的來信，除了他的參謀長每晨晋見他，和外國的駐日代表團偶然會見他一次外，麥帥在東京是「孤獨」的。二年來，裕仁也只與他會見二三次。</p>
<p>麥帥最近治理日本的政策，如郎將開放日本對外私人貿易，允許日本漁船駛往南極捕鯨，委託日本負責至帛琉島開礦、恢復日本之工業設備等，使日本人對他更爲崇敬。</p>
<h3>寂寞的報業</h3>
<p>— 黑子</p>
<p>我常常夢想我們有這樣一個報紙，能够眞正是全國性的，它能够使每一個國人在他起身的時候看到它。但是這一夢想終究是夢想，一二十萬份的報紙已經成爲我國第一大報了，距離幾百幾千萬份的銷數又是多麽遠呢？所以，我到現在還懷疑，在我國，並沒有一個足够說是全國性的大報。能够有一個報紙在天南地北的犬城市看到，已經是很好很好了。也因此，我　慕英國的「世界新聞」，他的七百五十萬份的發行數字，佔了英倫三島人口總和的六分之一，這就是設平均個六個英國人，買一份「世界新開」這是一個很多的發行量，恐怕已經將違到一戶一報這一發行景的飽和點了。</p>
<p>大槪一個報紙能够平均發行到一戶一份，這可以作爲現社會雜紙的最高發行理想。要達到這樣的目標，自然需要龐大的資力，衆多的人材，和健全並迅速的發行系統，更重要的是有嚴肅的態度和公正的論評。在這一方面，「世界新聞」的成功，在美國紐約時報就指出是得力於它的編輯政策的。</p>
<p>我們咸知一種正確的編輯股策必是褒善貶惡，還在一個並不尊重輿論的社會里，恒常會認得是個人的好惡。而因此摧殘報紙也會成爲一種「時髦的風氣」。本來對報業社會扶持之猶恐不懷，而竟予以精神上的打擊，和物質上的破壞，這自然使我國集更爲式徵了。</p>
<p>過來各地摧殘報紙的行勵曆出不窮，昆明「復興晚報」被晨校搗毀於前，安慶「新生日報」被暴徒刦掠破壞於後，現在寗波「大報」又因對役政有所評論，而由浙師管區及縣政府命令停刋三天了，不久前某報被毀，其主持人而且選會來滬呼籲，這里也說明了我國報界遠大發展的客觀　礎是如何的脆弱了。</p>
<p>科學小品</p>
<h3>蝶的羽化</h3>
<p>— 賈祖璋</p>
<p>在號稱「格物致知」而實際是「不格不知」的古人，對於由幼蟲雙蛹，再由蛹羽化成蝶這一個變態的過程，是覺得迷離恍惚而未能具體把握的。最早是莊子至樂篇說：「鳥足之根爲　螬，其葉爲蝴蝶。」又天瑞篇說：「蝴蝶胥也，化而爲蟲，生　下，其狀若蛻，其名曰鴝掇。」這是種化生說的記載，不能算是已經明白蝶的變態。後來搜神記說：「麥之爲蝴蝶也，羽翼生焉，眼目成焉，心智在焉，此自無知化爲有知而氣易也。」酉陽雜俎云：「秀才顧非熊少時，嘗見鬱棲中壞綠裙幅，旋化爲蝶。工部員外郞張周封言，百合花合之，泥其　，經宿化爲大蝴蝶。」也都是想當然的費話。</p>
<p>眞正能够見到羽化的記載，當推爾雅翼對於粉蝶和鳳蝶的說明爲最詳細正確：「今菜中靑蟲，當春時行綠屋壁或草木上，以絲自固。一夕，視之有圭角。六七日，其背折裂，蛻爲蝶出矣。其大蝶散卵於甘橘上，爲蟲青綠，旣久則化爲大蝶。」又澤州志云：「崇禎庚辰秋，析城山樹頭遍挂蟲殼，如人形，長三寸，綠色，衣冠襟袖宛然，兩腋下穿黑絨綫，如傀儡繩繫狀。山中僧人取懸室內，至春時，綠殼開裂，中飛出一蝴蝶，絕可觀。」這對於蛹的形狀，刻劃得最爲詳細，可惜沒有說明蝶的形態，無法老查拖是什麼種類。</p>
<p>北戶錄有一則媚蝶的記載，雖然不知所指是何種蝶類，對於變態的經過，却有可貴的實騐的觀察：「嶺表有鶴子草，蔓花也。當夏開花，形如飛鶴，翅羽　距皆全。云是媚草，釆曝以代面靨。蔓上生雙蟲，食葉。收入粉奩，以葉餉之，老則蛻而爲蝶，赤黃色。女子收而佩之，如細鳥皮，令人媚悅，號爲媚蝶。」</p>
<p>本草綱目列舉各家化蝶的說明以後，加了一個結論說：「皆各據其所見者而言爾，蓋不知　　諸蟲，至老供各蛻而爲蝶蛾，如蠶之必羽化也。朽衣物亦必生蟲而化。」這是很合理的說明。但接着說：「草木花葉之化者，乃氣化，風化也。其色亦各隨其蟲所食花葉及所化之物色而然。」那又墮入化生說的迷霧中了。</p>
<p>初初羽化的繅，翅膀皺折，身體柔弱，必須休息相當時間，方才能够展翅飛行。楊萬里有一首觀物化詩，描寫羽化蝶的情態，異常眞切：「蝴蝶新生未解飛，髮拳粉濕睡花枝。後來借得風光力，不記如癡似醉時。」</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐</p>
<p>旅館成爲美國人生活中的一種需要，因爲很多小家庭並不自已開秋，而是上館子進食，美國靑年夫婦很少耐性下　治膳的，不是把麵烘焦了，就是鷄湯燉乾了。而且自己開秋，買菜便成爲一件大事；在中國內地有菜販把菜挑上門來，在美國必須到雜糧舖去買，美國人沒有用籃子的習慣，因胳膊下夾了大麵包，兩手捧了鷄魚·牛奶·鷄蛋·蔔萄·白菜·有汽車的固然毋需自己提摔，但主婦買菜時問，汽車已被丈夫坐到辦公機關了，如果夫婦兩人的小家庭，還是不開秋的好，飯館集中鬧市，咖啡店則幾乎每條街都有。脚啡店廳有供飯，但三明治也可果腹。</p>
<p>飯館分好幾種，有附設在大旅館中的高貴飯店，進食時有樂隊伴秦，導　地方每客起碼三元半，普通沒有樂隊的飯館每客　二　之角左右，規模較大的咖啡店兼供飯食，最經濟而大方的是自助餐廉Cafeteria規模均極宏偉，足容百餘人共餐，進門後排隊魚貫而前，自取膠盤·或鉛盤·刀叉·玻璃盃，行至分菜櫃時，任取所要之菜，如紅燒牛肉·麵條鷄湯·冷盆·冰淇淋·咖啡·點心之類·經過記賬小姐時，她把飯錢寫在一張紙上交給你，然後找一個位置坐下，吃完將錢付給收款的一位小姐，大抵每餐以一元爲度。這里不收小賬。如果赴其他餐館不但菜價較昻，，小賬也得給一二成。</p>
<p>我們中國人爲了給國家爭面子，小賬一給就是一元二元，如果十個人叙餐，給一二十元小賬已是很高吝的了。青年會食堂是更經濟的塲合，但每個城市祗有一個靑年會，而自助餐廳則隨處皆有，藥房裏的冷飲櫃也供給三明治和夾香腸的長圓形麵包，美國人稱那種猪肝色的假香腸爲　hot　dog，美國女子最喜歡吃那種東西，但是你如果問她要不要吃香腸，她又臉紅不好意思起來，那東西旣不可口，也不雅觀。（二十）</p>
<h3>是可忍，孰不可忍？</h3>
<p>— 項軍</p>
<p>「」九四七年六月廿五日，英政府舉行拳擊賽於普茲茅斯（Plyinoutli），當邀請各國駐英使節及軍事人員參觀，凡廿餘萬人，其盛况爲戰後所僅見，我留英海軍六百人亦準時到塲，且與他國軍人同列於最前面，臨風飄蕩中，見英·美·蘇·法·……各國大旗屹然並列，獨缺中國旗一面。正擬質詢，英方忽懇請我後調，事後，始知係將英女兵調上前列。此刻，觀衆情緒，已隨拳擊者之緊張而高亢嘩然。行列中，驟聞X君悲憤慘呌：「看，看—我們的國旗！…」萬目睽睽中，見一輻巨大之「靑天白日滿地紅」國旗，竟被平舖於拳擊塲上—殘踏於拳擊者之脚下，六百名中國海軍爲祖國遭此侮辱，莫不悲憤塡膺，沉痛淚下。立向主持人質詢，其答覆爲「我不知道。」乃憤然相率回營—（即Renown巡洋艦上）。電請我駐英大使作堅强而有效之抗議，迄今尚無下文。僉認此事件非出偶然，如不得合理且圓滿之公開答覆，願全體立刻回國，並將　請國人一致拒絕領謝「大」英帝國贈我之逾齡破爛兵艦。……」摘友人來緘。</p>
<p>對上述消息，我政府應立即出嚴重抗議。</p>

<h3>Mobilizing to Suppress the Rebellion and Complete Constitutional Government: The Executive Yuan Passes Implementation Guidelines for Submission to the State Council for Discussion and Promulgation the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The key case of the "Mobilizing to Suppress the Rebellion and Complete Constitutional Government Implementation Guidelines" was carefully studied and revised at the political affairs meeting on the 15th. It was decided to submit it to the State Council for discussion on the 18th before its implementation. These guidelines were drafted by the Executive Yuan in conjunction with the heads of relevant ministries and commissions after several days of meetings and discussions. After being passed by the subcommittee on the 14th, Wang Yunwu presented them on the 15th. After three hours of debate, it was decided to eliminate clauses related to the requisition of people's real estate, sanctions against cultural aspects, and inspections of private communications and secret correspondence from the original proposal. There are a total of sixteen articles, the full text of which is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) These guidelines are formulated in accordance with the provisions of the "National General Mobilization to Suppress Communist Bandit Rebellion and Achieve Constitutional Government" case and the "National General Mobilization Law," as passed by the State Council and implemented nationwide.</p>
<p>(2) The implementation of constitutional government and all elections related to constitutional government shall be actively carried out in accordance with regulations.</p>
<p>(3) Military service, labor service, and other related manpower required for suppressing the rebellion shall be actively mobilized. Any acts of evading conscription or hindering conscription shall be severely punished.</p>
<p>(4) Military grain, clothing, medicine, coal, steel, transportation, communication equipment, and other military supplies required for suppressing the rebellion shall be actively mobilized. Any acts of evading requisition, purchase, or hoarding shall be severely punished.</p>
<p>(5) Labor and management in all industries should cooperate closely. If there are disputes, they should be mediated and arbitrated in accordance with the law. Any acts of strikes, work stoppages, shutdowns, factory closures, or other acts that hinder production and social order shall be severely punished.</p>
<p>(6) In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the government may prevent or manage the transaction prices of daily necessities, the salaries and wages of all industries, the flow of funds for materials, and the use of financial business.</p>
<p>(7) In order to maintain peace and order, the government may restrict gatherings and propaganda that incite rebellion.</p>
<p>(8) For recovered bandit areas, the competent authorities should consolidate public security, maintain order, and, when necessary, provide loans, suspend taxes, and provide various social relief and medical care services.</p>
<p>(9) People returning from bandit areas should be properly assisted and settled by the competent authorities.</p>
<p>(10) The competent authorities should provide special guidance and assistance to the food, fuel, textile, smelting, and other industries with special needs. If there is a shortage of funds needed, the national bank should provide loans to enable them to actively promote supply. When necessary, the government may manage their finished products.</p>
<p>(11) All areas not affected by banditry should refresh local politics, ensure social stability, and select key water conservancy projects for construction to benefit people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>(12) Increase reasonable tax revenue and limit unnecessary expenditures to meet the urgent needs of suppressing the rebellion.</p>
<p>(13) Formulate measures for saving consumption and improving efficiency, which government agencies and the people should follow consistently.</p>
<p>(14) The basic rights of the people should be earnestly respected and properly protected. Except for various laws and regulations necessary for mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, which must be strictly enforced, any extra-legal acts of encroachment shall be strictly prevented.</p>
<p>(15) If detailed rules are required for the implementation of these guidelines, the relevant ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan shall formulate measures and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval, and promulgate and implement them separately by order.</p>
<p>(16) Those who violate Articles 3 to 7 of these guidelines, or who should be punished or restricted in accordance with the measures prescribed in those articles, shall be punished in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Acts Obstructing National General Mobilization.</p>
<p>(17) Public officials who violate the law or neglect their duties when exercising the powers conferred by these guidelines shall be severely punished in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>(18) Except as otherwise provided in these guidelines, the Executive Yuan may issue necessary orders at any time in accordance with the National General Mobilization Law in order to achieve the purpose of suppressing the rebellion.</p>
<h3>Economic Reform Plan: Preliminary Comprehensive Review; Decisions Made on Both Increasing Revenue and Reducing Expenditure</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] A subcommittee review meeting composed of the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Four Joint Offices made a preliminary comprehensive review with reference to the economic reform plan and the national mobilization guidelines. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>In terms of fiscal revenue, increase tariff sources and raise tax rates. In terms of expenditure, reduce unnecessary institutions. The expenses of various agencies will not be increased unless they have been approved and deemed necessary. Local finances should strive for self-sufficiency, rectify existing taxes and tax rates.</p>
<p>Loans from banks and bureaus should be targeted at industries that produce daily necessities for the people. The loan method should be based on ordering and lending real objects in principle. The control of national banks and private banks will be strengthened at the same time to prevent smuggling and capital flight. In addition to strengthening anti-smuggling funds and expanding anti-smuggling strength, domestic remittances will be fully allocated by the Central Bank. With regard to the control of finance, measures for controlling urban finance have been drafted. Inspections of the business operations of banks and merchants will be strengthened, and violations of regulations will be strictly prohibited. The establishment of branches will be restricted, customer accounts will be investigated, loan targets will be specified, and loan uses will be reviewed. All these have been clearly defined.</p>
<p>In terms of commodity prices, the basic policy is to control materials. The regulation of cotton yarn and cloth will be handled by the Cotton Textile Regulation Committee, using cotton to control yarn and yarn to control cloth as a means. The price will be determined by the joint negotiation of various manufacturers based on market supply and demand, and its allocation will be mainly targeted at the reproduction industry.</p>
<p>The China Textile Company is responsible for the supply of cooking oil, which will be implemented in Nanjing and Shanghai for the time being. For the distribution of fuel coal, several large coal mines are designated to increase production, which will be uniformly charged by the Fuel Management Committee to supply various public utilities and transportation coal. If there is surplus capacity, it will be used for civilian purposes. Its supply is also limited to Nanjing and Shanghai for the time being.</p>
<p>In terms of increasing production, the disposal of enemy and puppet factories that have not been sold should be accelerated, either by repairing them or dismantling them, so that each piece of equipment can be used to its maximum effect. It is hoped that Japanese reparations factories can be properly coordinated with production. Establish industrial and mining equipment warehouses in various important areas so that materials can be smoothly regulated and stored. Local industry and commerce guidance offices can participate in the preliminary review and post-event inspection of industrial and mining loans in various places.</p>
<p>In terms of international trade, due to the large number of existing institutions and the decentralization of powers, it is better to organize a unified institution to handle everything. The purchase of export materials will be increased, the scope of export bills of exchange will be expanded, and export costs will be reduced.</p>
<p>In commercial management, in addition to supporting legitimate commerce, speculation and hoarding will be strictly prohibited. In order to revitalize the capital operation of various commercial firms, the revaluation of assets and the increase of equity capital will be accelerated. In order to find a home for idle funds in various places to avoid harming the market, securities markets will be established in major cities as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Wedemeyer Reviews Our Situation Before Departure</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 14th] Officials hope today that Wedemeyer's on-site investigation in China this week will promote a more active U.S. policy in the Far East. However, the United States is in a dilemma on its China policy, and officials here are not very confident whether Wei's trip can find a way out. At the beginning of this week, Wei will review the recent developments in the Chinese situation with the State Department, and then set off for China to investigate various facts. In general, the actions of the Soviet army in Korea and Lushun and Dalian, as well as the evidence of the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet government, are all within the scope of the investigation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] This reporter learned from officials today that Mr. Bader Hua, the counselor of the US Embassy in China, will work in the China Section of the State Department during his stay in Washington to discuss matters before returning to China. He will submit a report to Marshall on the 15th or 16th and have discussions with other State Department officials.</p>
<h3>The United States Donates a Large Number of Ships to Our Country: We Have Received Formal Notice</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Military News Agency: Our authorities have received formal notice of the 271 ships donated by the United States to our country. More than 100 of them are naval vessels, some of which are in China. Most of them have been accepted by our naval authorities. Six destroyer submarines will be accepted in Qing in the next few days. It is reported that the ships currently in the United States will be sailed back in batches by naval officers and soldiers who have completed training in the United States this year.</p>
<h3>The Envoy Returns to Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The envoy and consultant Fu Jingbo safely flew back to Beijing at noon on the 15th, exactly one year after he came to Beijing to take office last year, but he did not express any feelings.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] The envoy and Fu Jingbo left Ping for Beijing by plane on the morning of the 15th. The ambassador's toothache has been cured.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jia'ao Goes to Tianjin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] Zhang Jiaao, President of the Central Bank, left for Tianjin at 10:30 am on the 15th. Kilpatrick, economic advisor to the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, accompanied him. It is reported that Zhang will fly to Shenyang on the morning of the 16th to negotiate the transfer of food from the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Our Embassy in the United States: Receives American Celebrities</h3>

<h3>Various Parties Are Not Optimistic About the Sino-Japanese Trade Issue</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 15th] Various circles in China are quite indifferent to the hope of Sino-Japanese trade after August 15. They are quite dissatisfied with MacArthur's policy of subsidizing Japanese export trade. It is heard that the Executive Yuan will convene representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the afternoon of the 15th to discuss the Japanese export subsidy policy. The business community is deeply afraid that this subsidy policy will lead to Japan's dumping policy and hinder Chinese industry. Officials pointed out that the United States opposed the incentive policy of the former President of the Executive Yuan, but the United States is considering taking the same measures for defeated Japan. As for the future of Sino-Japanese trade, it is generally believed that it is not very bright. Most of the Japanese export goods are on the list of Chinese import prohibitions, and China cannot supply Japan with the goods it needs, such as soybeans and coal. In addition, there are difficulties in exchange rates. So far, there is no specified rate between the Chinese legal tender and the Japanese yen. All transactions are calculated in US dollars, which is also considered impractical because China's foreign exchange reserves seem to be inadequate. However, various steps have now been taken to prepare to participate in trade with Japan. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has decided to request the National Federation of Commerce and Industry and the Industrial Association to submit a list of 192 traders each, so that the government can select 64 from them. This number is what the Allied Headquarters allowed China to propose. Among them will be eight overseas traders.</p>

<h3>Liu Kejun Discusses Quotas, Says Extremely Careful Approach Taken</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] After the passage of the constitutional regulations, there has been considerable dissatisfaction from various parties regarding the allocation of quotas for National Assembly delegates and legislators. Professional organizations, women's groups, and overseas Chinese organizations have all raised concerns, believing that the quota allocation needs revision. On the 15th, our reporter interviewed Liu Kejun, convener of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan, to inquire about these opinions. Liu stated that the Legislative Yuan had considered both legal principles and factual circumstances when discussing the quota allocation. Each committee member took the discussions very seriously, and every decision was made after lengthy deliberation, ensuring fairness. Regarding the allocation of legislator seats for professional representatives, the final number was set at eighty-four, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan, thus having full legal basis. The quota of five seats for merchant groups is also limited by the factual situation. According to the original plan, agricultural and labor groups were supposed to be allocated 60%, but this has been reduced, demonstrating that various aspects were taken into consideration when the Legislative Yuan discussed this type of allocation. As for the requirement for national women's organizations to have five branches, this was initially proposed by a female legislator, whose original intention was to promote the healthy development of women's organizations. The committee members believed that the intention was excellent and therefore approved it. Women's organizations can still register, and there is still time to establish branches in various locations. Regarding the allocation of quotas for overseas Chinese, during the discussions in the Legislative Yuan, everyone from President Sun down advocated for an increase. In fact, the quotas have already been increased, so it cannot be said that it is unfair.</p>

<h3>Communist Troops Break Faith and Destroy Yellow River Embankments; National Army Resolves to Fight Back; UNRRA Personnel Involved in Restoring Embankments in Communist Areas Should Withdraw Immediately; General Chen Notifies Cleveland</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Communist bandit Liu Bocheng's forces have broken faith and crossed the Yellow River to invade, destroying the embankments. Chief of Staff Chen Cheng notified UNRRA's China Office Director Cleveland of this in a memorandum on July 8th. The memorandum is recorded as follows: "To Director Cleveland: Regarding memorandum No. 614 from Zhang Hao dated July 1, it has been found that the Communist Liu Bocheng's forces have violated the ceasefire agreement and deceived contacts by using the guise of embankment restoration to expand their rebellion. Therefore, the previous request from General Egerton for the government to guarantee no military threat from government forces in recent weeks is ineffective. UNRRA personnel assigned to embankment restoration work in Communist areas should withdraw immediately. Otherwise, the government cannot be held responsible for any unexpected damages suffered by the restoration workers. As for the reasons for the Communist Party's breach of agreement and breaking faith, please inquire with the Communist side for clarification. This is to notify you for your information and action, and please provide a reply. Respectfully, Chen Cheng, Chief of Staff."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the military spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense issued a statement on the 15th, stating: As the Yellow River flood season approaches this year, the government previously agreed to the embankment restoration plan proposed by UNRRA's China Office Director Cleveland, organizing a joint committee and agreeing that both sides would immediately cease all military actions in the Yellow River coastal area. The government's actions were purely out of concern for the lives and property of millions of people and to prevent an unprecedented disaster. Therefore, a general order was issued to the National Army in the Lu-Yu area to temporarily cease pursuing the Communist bandit Liu Bocheng's forces, who were about to be pacified, in order to build the river embankments and prevent flooding. Chen Cheng officially replied to UNRRA General Egerton from a military command standpoint, guaranteeing that Yellow River embankment restoration workers would not be subjected to military threats, and provided three suggestions for UNRRA's attention: (1) UNRRA should guarantee that no Communist armed forces are mixed in with the personnel participating in embankment restoration work in the Communist area; (2) The number of wooden boats used for embankment restoration at each crossing point should be limited to fifty; (3) The joint committee must be actively established, and offices should be set up in each work area on the north bank of the Yellow River in Lu Province. Subsequently, the government dispatched Major General Ye Nan of the Ministry of National Defense to participate in the joint committee on behalf of the government. While rushing to repair the embankments day and night, Liu Bocheng's subordinate Yang Yong led more than 5,000 troops across the Yellow River from Shilipu near the Grand Canal on June 22nd, and Liu Bocheng's five columns, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th, also crossed the river near Wuxizhuang, ten kilometers south of Puyang County, at 12:30 AM on June 30th, taking advantage of the National Army's withdrawal to seize crossings and cover the subsequent troops to continue crossing south, occupying Beiwangzhao, capturing Youcheng, and besieging Yuncheng. It is reported today that more than 30,000 Communist bandits have crossed the river. Such actions, using UNRRA's embankment restoration as a guise to cross the river, breaking faith, and seizing opportunities, have caused unexpected damage to our defending soldiers and civilians along the Yellow River. Therefore, we solemnly declare that, for the sake of self-defense and for the sake of the lives, property, and security of millions of good people in the Lu-Yu area, the National Army will resolutely fight back and will not be restricted by UNRRA General Egerton's "government guarantee of no military threat from our forces in recent weeks." Furthermore, from today onward, all UNRRA personnel engaged in embankment restoration in the Lu-Yu area should immediately withdraw to safe areas. Otherwise, the government cannot be held responsible for any unexpected damages suffered as a result.</p>
<h3>Isoya Re-Examined Yesterday, Debate Concluded, Sentencing Set for the 22nd</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Japanese war criminal Renzo Isoya was re-examined by the War Crimes Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense yesterday morning, and the debate was conducted. It began at 9:15 AM and concluded around 12:00 PM. The court ordered the debate to be concluded and set the sentencing for the 22nd.</p>
<p>Defense Lawyers Present Two Points</p>
<p>Court President Shi Meiyu, the judges, and others attended the court. After the opening was announced, the appointed defense lawyers Yu Shuzhen and Chen Hanqing stood up to present their opinions. Wang stated: The defendant submitted a defense statement on the 12th, stating that the defendant still had many pieces of evidence in Japan that were en route to Nanjing. Is there a need for the court to conduct further investigations on this matter and change the date of the debate? Chen stated: According to the defendant's claims, he is a loyal follower of our late Premier, strongly advocating Sino-Japanese friendship and making contributions to the Chinese revolution. Could Mr. Dai Jitao be invited to testify? Judge Shi replied: Regarding the two points mentioned, after deliberation, the first point, that the defense statement has not yet been received by the court; the second point, regarding the defendant's crimes against humanity, we can determine this based on his usual moral behavior, without the need to summon Mr. Dai and others to testify. As for the issue of the defense statement not arriving on time, we can extend the debate time, but cannot change the date.</p>
<p>Isoya Presents a Set of Old Arguments</p>
<p>At this time, the prosecutor began his arguments, listing his crimes. Isoya then began his defense. First, regarding the expulsion of civilians in Hong Kong, he defended himself by saying that the evacuation of the people was out of the people's voluntary return to their hometowns, first registering with the civil affairs department and then handling the selection of their hometowns, which was voluntary and not forced. The other part of the exiled were bad elements, and for the sake of protecting the order of the majority of the people, the exile of criminals occurred, but no civilians were exiled. Next, regarding the war crimes, he argued as in the investigation court, only saying that his concept of Sino-Japanese friendship has never changed, and he has shown this in China and Hong Kong. He claims that all war crimes attributed to him do not match the time and place. Then, regarding the crimes against humanity, Isoya still claimed that all illegal acts of the army were unrelated to him. Finally, regarding the implementation of the poisoning policy in Hong Kong, he said that when the army entered Hong Kong, there were many opium dens in Hong Kong, and there were many opium smokers, so he decided to adopt a gradual reduction method and register them and sell opium publicly, without any intention of poisoning. Then, he submitted the defense statement to the court, and it was already 11:40.</p>
<p>Two Lawyers Defend Responsibly</p>
<p>The defense lawyers then stood up to make defenses on his behalf. Attorney Chen first denied the "war criminal" title of Isoya, saying that Isoya was no longer a war criminal when he came to China and should be studied by the court. The remaining three defenses: (1) The crime of violating peace is inferred from Isoya's work that he must have participated in the Japanese invasion plan, but this is only speculation and not a fact, so it is not established; (2) The constitution of war crimes and crimes against humanity does not match the evidence of time and place. Regarding the poisoning of Hong Kong, it is believed that Hong Kong already had a popular opium epidemic and should not be responsible for the poisoning; (3) The matter of exiling civilians was to exile bad elements who disrupted public order to protect the safety of the majority of the people and did not exile civilians. The conclusion is to ask the court to judge leniently. Attorney Wang denied the points of violating peace, publicly selling opium, harming civilians, and exiling civilians, and emphasized that Isoya had loved the Republic of China since he was a child and was a loyal follower of the Premier, advocating Sino-Japanese cooperation, and had no aggressive ambitions for our territory. The debate ended at about 12:00.</p>

<h3>Fu Jiaojin Believes Yellow River Flows Through Sichuan Province Claim is Baseless</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] When a reporter inquired with Fu Jiaojin, Director of the Department of Territorial Affairs of the Ministry of Interior, today about the claim that the upper reaches of the Yellow River flow through Sichuan Province, he stated: The Yellow River originates from the north of the Bayan Har Mountains, flows through Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, and then turns east into Shanxi and Henan. The claim that it flows through Sichuan Province has been rumored for a long time and is outdated. The areas near the borders of Qinghai, Gansu, and Sichuan are mostly forests, high mountains, and dangerous obstacles, with sparse population. The area has always been inhabited by the Lolo people, with little contact with the outside world. This area is commonly known as the Lolo Region. Although the boundaries of the three provinces have been delineated, they have not yet been clearly surveyed. The claim by Ma Biwei that the Yellow River flows through Sichuan Province has no factual basis. Mr. Fu also stated: The Department of Territorial Affairs will soon send personnel to survey the undefined borders of various provinces, cities, and counties in the country to determine their boundaries and the scope of their jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>Hankou Commodity Tax Bureau Illegally Collects Taxes, Embezzling Over 4 Billion Yuan; Citizens Report, Evidence of Receipts, Account Books, etc., Confirmed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 15th] A shocking corruption case in the Hankou Commodity Tax Bureau has recently been exposed here. The case was initiated by citizens reporting the bureau's illegal collection of cattle hide taxes. After more than 40 days of investigation by Sun Lilu, a supervisor from the Ministry of Finance, it was found that the collection of taxes on raw cattle hides was indeed unauthorized. The bureau was ordered to return the taxes. It was also discovered that the bureau illegally collected "inspection fees" ranging from 500 to 3,000 yuan per package for items such as tobacco leaves, local wine, flour, cotton yarn, and sugar. Statistics show that the monthly private collection of disguised taxes exceeded 500 million yuan, and the total amount embezzled from November of last year to June of this year was at least over 4 billion yuan. As a result of the fraud and smuggling, the national treasury suffered even greater losses, three times this amount. Mr. Sun solemnly stated: He has obtained receipts from the tax collectors and other account books containing "black fees," which serve as solid evidence for this case. He will return to Beijing within a week to report to the central government for thorough investigation.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 15th] The First Pacification Area Headquarters, in order to strengthen the self-defense forces in various counties, found that the county finances were incurring huge expenditures, often through levies on the people. Lower-level personnel were also found to be embezzling funds, leading to resentment and greatly affecting the pacification efforts.

Each county was also ordered to consult with its local council based on the original measures, taking into account local conditions, and to implement them conscientiously. It is said that the fundraising criteria are: farmland is divided into two harvests, spring and autumn, with each mu donating ten jin of physical goods each time, to be paid by the tenant farmers who will hold a receipt when paying rent. In addition, each mu will donate ten jin of fuel grass collected from the tenant farmers. For industry and commerce, the standard for donating physical goods will be based on the amount of business tax, with each county independently determining the amount. The preparation and collection of materials and funds will adopt an independent economic system. A financial committee consisting of nine to eleven members from the council, various public law bodies, and impartial gentry will be organized to supervise and review the budget, storage, distribution, auditing, and other matters.

<h3>Editorial: Viewing the World from the United States</h3>
<p>President Truman convened an important meeting at the White House on Monday, summoning Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and leaders of both the Republican and Democratic parties in the Senate and House of Representatives, to review the current international situation. Afterward, according to Vandenberg, President Truman believed that there was no need to convene a special session of Congress this autumn; however, he reserved the right to convene a special session of Congress in the event of an emergency. Looking at the world from the White House meeting, it can be seen that the world today is still lingering at the crossroads of war and peace. If we observe the future trends of the world with a pleasant attitude, we may not be able to be optimistic, at least in the recent five or ten years, no country dares to lightly talk about war, and no country's people are willing to go to war. Therefore, no matter what, a "no war" peace can ultimately be maintained for five or ten years. However, the weather is unpredictable, and the international situation is ever-changing. No one can predict the development of the world political situation; especially the United States, which bears the responsibility for world security, is currently making plans for a rainy day. This really makes us unable to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Recently, the most noteworthy measures taken by the United States to actively prepare for future wars include the following: (1) The United States Department of the Army has drafted a six-year plan to store military raw materials on the American continent that are difficult to obtain but necessary when war breaks out again; including rare metals recently discovered in the Soviet Union, India, and Africa, as well as petroleum imported into the United States from the Middle East. (2) Based on the conclusions obtained from the atomic bomb test on Bikini Atoll, the United States Navy believes that only submarines can avoid atomic bomb attacks and has begun to build a super submarine fleet, which can be used for reconnaissance and transportation in the future. (3) All the islands previously held by Japan in the Pacific Ocean have significant military strategic value in future wars and will be transferred by the United Nations to the United States for sole trusteeship. The United States Congress has drafted a bill, which has been passed by both houses and will soon be submitted to the White House for President Truman to sign.</p>
<p>The United States is actively preparing militarily to cope with major international changes in the future. Although this is a passive approach and increases the risk of deepening the international situation; however, on the other hand, since the United States has no way to eliminate international opposition politically, diplomatically, or economically, thereby promoting international understanding and cooperation, and jointly maintaining permanent peace, it naturally has no choice but to make plans for a rainy day in the military in case of emergency: or because of the strength and sufficient preparation of the United States, it can instead eliminate other countries' ambitions for aggression, the so-called "stopping war with war, eliminating war with war." When we recall the general history of the eve of the outbreak of World War II, the weakness of peace-loving democratic countries was sufficient to encourage the arrogance of aggressors. General historians believe that if the fascist Japan, Italy, and Nazi Germany had been severely attacked when they began their aggression, World War II might not have broken out; even if it had broken out, if democratic countries had been fully prepared earlier and had the ability to stop Japan's aggression against China and Germany's aggression against Poland, World War II would not have lasted so long. Therefore, the recent plans made by the United States for a rainy day are, in any case, worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Nearly two full years have passed since the victorious end of the war, and the evolution of the international situation has been deteriorating, which is really disappointing; wartime allies fought for victory, and victory was finally achieved; after the war, the allies created peace, but not only did they fail to achieve anything, but instead made peace leave this world, getting farther and farther away. President Truman, in view of the seriousness of the world situation and believing that some countries are threatened by external forces, specifically proposed to Congress the plan to aid Greece and Turkey, helping them develop strong forces sufficient to resist the intrusion of external forces, which has become the Truman Doctrine known to everyone today. If we are fair, the purpose of the Truman Doctrine is also to maintain world peace; however, the Truman Doctrine has unexpectedly aroused a profound reaction from the Soviet Union. Hungary first experienced a coup d'état, and similar events occurred in Bulgaria and Romania, making some Balkan countries even more controlled by the Soviet Union, and the phenomenon of European division has become increasingly blatant. If this terrible trend is not reversed, it will lead to a more serious crisis in the world. Secretary of State Marshall, in view of the failure of the Truman Doctrine, also had the intention to change the course of American foreign policy, and gave a speech at Harvard University at the beginning of last month, proposing the United States' plan to economically assist the recovery of European countries, the motives of which are two: (1) to include the Soviet Union in the scope of the US aid to Europe plan, in order to test whether the Soviet Union has the sincerity to cooperate with the United States; (2) to assist the European countries devastated by the war, so that their societies, economies, and politics will not collapse, which would be conducive to the growth and development of the Communist Party. However, the result obtained after the publication of the Marshall Plan led to the division of Europe. Not only did the Soviet Union refuse to participate in the European Economic Conference, but the Soviet Union's eight vassal states also rejected the invitations from Britain and France. The Soviet Union also announced the "Molotov Plan," attempting to organize an economic group in Eastern and Central Europe; from then on, Europe was clearly divided into two major groups, either black or white.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, the European Economic Conference will naturally not have good achievements. The United States needs to spend about 200 billion US dollars to assist Europe, and American taxpayers have long called for reducing their burdens. Seeing the actual situation in Europe, they are even less willing to use large sums of money on Europe. Therefore, looking forward to the future of Europe, it feels even more gloomy.</p>
<h3>The Urgent Housing Rent Problem Awaiting Solution</h3>
<p>The housing rental problem is one of the most urgent problems awaiting solution at present, and it is also one of the most difficult problems to solve. Today, the municipal government will invite relevant parties to discuss it together. What the plan is and what the result will be are still unknown. We believe that if this problem is to be effectively solved, the following four points must be taken into account:</p>
<p>1. A comprehensive plan must be made, and one cannot only think of one side. It is a fact that the real estate industry is currently unprofitable, and it is also a fact that there is a serious housing shortage and it is difficult to find a house: no one is building new houses, no one is repairing old houses, kind owners are enduring losses and are at a loss, while those who are cunning and vicious are extorting in every way, repeatedly increasing rents, and openly exceeding the rent rate stipulated by the municipal government, even by a thousand times or even ten thousand times. Therefore, if the municipal government wants to implement regulations on rent rates, it must take into account the interests of all parties, and make appropriate and reasonable decisions, so that it can be promoted smoothly and in accordance with the circumstances.</p>
<p>2. Orders must be obeyed and not just become empty words. As mentioned above: kind people suffer losses, and vicious people extort in every way, which is due to the fact that laws cannot be implemented automatically. Therefore, after agreeing on a uniform rent rate, it is necessary to simultaneously agree on effective enforcement measures, and closely coordinate with judicial authorities to earnestly implement them, so that those who abide by the law are protected, and those who violate the law have no way to act recklessly, and then this newly revised rent rate will have meaning. Otherwise, an empty piece of paper is equivalent to the current situation, and it will definitely not improve the current rental situation, nor will it alleviate the suffering of both parties, and it may even make things worse.</p>
<p>3. The bad habit of tenants seeking profit must be corrected. Currently, most kind landlords are suffering losses, while many tenants, the so-called second landlords, are occupying other people's property, demanding various fees, renting at high prices, and earning unjustifiable profits. There is no justifiable reason to explain these situations. Now, for the sake of protecting the general tenants, if the landlords still need to be subject to considerable restrictions, then the second landlords similar to the landlords should be strictly restricted, so as to show the fairness of things. Otherwise, favoring one side and neglecting the other will only protect the second landlords, increase the landlords' disappointment, and will not help alleviate the suffering of the third tenants.</p>
<p>4. Paying rent in foreign currency and in kind must be strictly prohibited. The government has long prohibited paying rent in foreign currency, but in reality, it has not disappeared. As for paying rent in kind, due to the excessive fluctuations in commodity prices, this trend has gradually spread from the inland to Shanghai. This not only damages the credibility of the legal currency but also deepens the burden on the tenants. Regardless of whether the rent rate is adjusted or not, this matter should be strictly prohibited to protect the welfare of the majority.</p>
<p>The so-called rental problem is actually too complicated. The landlords demand that the restriction on rent should be based on the provisions of Article 97 of the Land Law, which is based on the law. Whether a fixed-term lease contract should be extended indefinitely is also a legal issue. And opening up the ban on mortgaging real estate, and setting up a land bank to finance long-term funds are even more related to solving the housing shortage and activating finance. We suspect that the municipal government is only focusing on what is most urgent, and may not have time to do so, so we will only briefly contribute our views on the rent problem for the authorities' reference.</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Watch the Development of the Situation in Greece, Allied Fleet Sails to Athens, Security Council Convenes Emergency Meeting, Greek Government Forces Turn Favorable in Epirus</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 15th Broadcast: The Greek Minister of Air Force recently announced: In the Epirus area, the situation has turned favorable for the government forces. The Greek guerrillas who went south to attack Genoa have been contained by the government forces' pincer offensive. The Greek Senate also stated that a certain army has a tendency to launch a "new strategy" from Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 15th] Military sources stated today: A decisive battle in northern Greece is imminent. Government forces have seized multiple strongholds on the Vouchi River Valley road leading to Ioannina, the capital of Epirus Province, and the pincer encirclement of the leftist guerrillas who went south from Konitsa two days ago will be closed.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 14th] Greek government forces have won the battle of Korçë and have completely gained the initiative. American, Australian and Soviet representatives of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Team have flown from Thessaloniki to the war zone for inspection. A senior government official believes that the offensive in Korçë is related to the Greek Communists' attempts to establish a "free government." There is now a definite plan to declare the Communist Party and all parties colluding with the Communist Party to form a "free government" illegal. These plans include continued arrests, occupying the headquarters of leftist political parties, and closing down Communist and leftist newspapers.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 15th Broadcast: According to the Greek newspaper Estia, a large British and American fleet (including an aircraft carrier) arrived today in Piraeus, southwest of Athens.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 15th Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting today on the invasion of Greece. American representative Johnson warned that the council must immediately stop discussing other issues and address the Balkan problem. Johnson stated that the United States is paying attention to the new developments in the Greek situation. According to the Greek ambassador to the United States, he was ordered by his government to notify the United Nations that a powerful enemy force of armed soldiers invaded Greek territory from Albania on the 13th of this month, and there were irregular troops and international brigades organized by the Communist Party, which are now concentrated on the Albanian border.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th] A Foreign Office spokesman stated today that the British government is currently investigating reports of an "international brigade" invading Greece. If it is proven that such a brigade exists, Britain and the United States will jointly file a complaint with the UN. British and American military and political authorities in Greece have exchanged information on this serious change in the situation. It is difficult to predict whether British troops will be ordered to join the fighting.</p>
<h3>Completion of Organization of Various Committees; European Conference to Adjourn; Resource Surveys of Each Country to be Completed by September 1st</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Paris, 15th Broadcast: The heads of the economic conference of sixteen European nations recently declared: Although the US Congress will not be able to take action on the Marshall Plan before winter, the collaborative organization for the revival of Europe will continue to proceed. French officials declared: The original plan of the sixteen European countries participating in this conference to complete the surveys of their respective national resources and dollar needs by September 1st remains unchanged.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 15th Dispatch] The European Economic Conference convened its third plenary session today to discuss the draft organization of five technical subcommittees and a secretariat proposed by the Rules of Procedure Committee. This plenary session will be the last one before the end of August. Chairman Bevin indicated that everything is proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 14th Dispatch] The working committee of the European Economic Conference unanimously passed the final draft for the implementation of the Marshall Plan today, designating the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Norway, and the Netherlands as members of the executive committee, and resolving the list of candidates for the four technical subcommittees as follows: Food and Agriculture—United Kingdom, France, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, and the Netherlands. Steel Industry—United Kingdom, France, Luxembourg, Norway, and Turkey. Transportation—United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland, and Turkey. Fuel and Electricity—United Kingdom, France, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Turkey, Sweden, and Switzerland. The list of candidates for each committee will be submitted to the third plenary session on the 15th for formal approval. According to French sources, the session on the 15th is likely to be the last one before the end of August, and further sessions will be convened after the work of the committees is completed. The Cooperation Committee will be attended by all sixteen participating countries and will have overall supervisory power over the decisions of the Executive Committee. The Working Committee also approved the establishment of a secretariat, with French representative Serroulle as Secretary-General, starting work on the 16th. Sweden was not included in the Executive Committee this time, and except for the Fuel and Electricity Subcommittee, it did not participate in the other three subcommittees. Steel is one of the country's major industries, but it is not named in the Steel Industry Subcommittee, which is particularly noteworthy. At the same time, a spokesman for the Dutch delegation stated that the Netherlands would promote the inclusion of western Germany in the European Recovery Program. It is said that Germany is the Netherlands' natural hinterland, and its western part must join the organization of sixteen countries, so that the French occupation zone and the British and American occupation zones can be combined into one. In addition, the Soviet Union continues to be very concerned about the progress of the conference. Although the Kremlin is deeply unhappy with the conference, it is still paying close attention to it.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador Visits Italian Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 14th Dispatch] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza had a thirty-minute conversation with Soviet Ambassador to France, Bogomolov, today at the Italian Embassy. An Italian spokesman said: The Soviet Ambassador's visit was an informal visit and was not pre-arranged, nor was it at Bogomolov's request. Sforza and Bogomolov met in Salerno, Italy, during the war, when Bogomolov was the Soviet envoy to Italy. Sforza came to Paris to attend the European Economic Conference and left a card to greet Bogomolov, who personally visited the Italian Embassy this morning. It is reported that the two may have discussed the European economy and the Italian peace treaty. Also, Sforza has already met with former French Prime Minister Blum.</p>
<h3>Marshall Delivers Speech; Explains Necessity of US Aid to Europe; Relationship Between US and Allied European Nations Faces Turning Point</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Salt Lake City, USA, 14th Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall delivered a speech to the Governors' Conference here tonight, warning the American people that if American aid does not arrive, European countries may change direction to the detriment of the United States. Once the United States recognizes this fact, it will certainly provide such assistance. In this regard, it is necessary for the government to obtain full support from the public. Marshall said: It is a difficult task to make ordinary people clearly understand international issues. Unless it is an eloquent speaker like Churchill, it is impossible to combine diplomatic rhetoric with pressing reality to make ordinary people understand the truth of the matter. The American people should give enthusiastic and sympathetic understanding to Europe's efforts to overcome national barriers and solve common economic problems.</p>
<p>The American people must make a decision on the current world situation, and this decision will have a profound impact on the future development of the situation. Our relationship with the traditional allies of the Old World is at a turning point, and this level should not be ignored. If we do not complete the task of assisting these countries to adapt to the needs of the new era, we must sit idly by as these countries change direction, contrary to their own traditions and our traditions. If so, the United States' position in the world will change dramatically. To date, efforts to restore the European economy have not been successful, but their benefits are greater than generally recognized. The United States can now more accurately estimate the needs of European countries and is carefully studying the implementation of various possible solutions from the perspective of American interests.</p>
<h3>Bevin Returns to England Today</h3>
<p>[Reuters Paris, 15th Dispatch] British sources believe that Foreign Minister Bevin may return to London today or tomorrow to attend the Transport and General Workers' Association meeting in Hastings on Thursday. If the Paris Conference can develop according to the planned schedule, the leaders of the delegations can entrust experts to carry out the work of the committees after today. After reaching this stage, Bevin will entrust the affairs to Mr. Frank, an expert in the British delegation, to be responsible for carrying it out.</p>
<h3>Poland May Reconsider Its Attitude Toward the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 15th Dispatch] Kaplica, a spokesman for the Polish Embassy in London, said: If the institutions established by the Paris Conference are within the scope of the United Nations institutions or the European Economic Commission, Poland may reconsider its attitude toward the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[United Press London, 14th Dispatch] A Polish government spokesman recently criticized the economic conference held in Paris at a press conference here, saying that one of its main purposes was to revive Germany. He also explained the reasons for Poland's refusal to participate, saying that Warsaw had received secret intelligence that the conference had been arranged in advance, so it was more or less a "puppet" conference.</p>
<h3>Republican Leader in US House of Representatives Advocates Independent Congressional Investigation of Overseas Situation in Order to Formulate Foreign Aid Bill Next Year</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 15th Dispatch] It was learned today that a group of Republican members of the House of Representatives are advocating that Congress conduct an independent investigation of the overseas military and economic situation in order to formulate any bills related to foreign countries in 1948. The investigation will be based on a bill drafted under the guidance of the House Republican Standing Committee and will be implemented by a special committee designated by Speaker Martin. According to Martin, the Republicans believe that Congress should collect its own information when discussing the Marshall Plan or other plans related to foreign countries, and should not rely entirely on the reports provided by various executive agencies and political committees. The special investigation committee to be established will include representatives of the House committees related to administrative affairs and foreign plans, conduct investigations at home and abroad, seek direct information, and submit it for discussion when Congress convenes in January next year. Congress must know the needs of various countries and the United States' ability to meet these needs. In addition to the advice provided by the two committees within the State Department and one committee outside the government recently established by President Truman to investigate the overseas situation, we should also obtain other opinions.</p>
<h3>Stassen Vigorously Advocates Elimination of the American Communist Party; Firmly Supports the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 15th Dispatch] Republican presidential candidate Stassen advocated on the 15th that a carefully considered and effective plan be formulated to convince the Kremlin that there is no hope for the Communist Party to infiltrate and control the United States. Stassen firmly supports the Marshall Plan and demands that Congress take action before adjourning so that the government has the power to pre-order $500 million worth of industrial equipment. Stassen also said, "We have not abandoned the eight Eastern European countries that refused to participate in the Paris Conference."</p>
<h3>Republican Congressman Mason Advocates Cutting off Relations with the Soviet Union; Only One Congressman Advocates Stopping Relief to Eastern Europe</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 14th Dispatch] Several Republican congressmen are advocating an economic blockade against Eastern European countries that refuse to participate in the Marshall Economic Recovery Plan or refuse to cooperate with the United States. Illinois Congressman Chiperfield stated that he advocates that the United States sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and isolate it until the Soviet Union is prepared to cooperate. Congressman Dickson of the same state advocated that Eastern European countries that refuse to participate in the Marshall Plan should not be allowed to receive relief from the $350 million war-torn country relief plan. Wisconsin Congressman Byrnes revealed that he had written to the President, requesting that relief to countries that refuse to participate in the Paris Conference be stopped.</p>
<h3>United States Stops Food Exports to Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>[Reuters Washington, 14th Dispatch] Secretary of Agriculture Anderson mentioned the wheat agreement between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia at a press conference today, saying that the United States does not intend to supply any food to Czechoslovakia at present. The United States does not intend to supply grain to countries that can obtain adequate food supplies from elsewhere. Although Anderson did not accuse the Soviet Union of not supplying food to needy countries, he said that the Soviet Union has a large surplus of grain available for export this year. Anderson also said that there is no hope for the British and American zones in Germany to become self-sufficient in agriculture. When Anderson mentioned the refusal of several European countries to participate in the economic cooperation conference, he said that the United States, regardless of political relations, always acts with compassion, and he truly does not know how much more compassion the United States needs. Anderson also revealed that in his report on his inspection of Germany this time, he will focus on increasing the production of Ruhr coal in order to increase Germany's exports and exchange for food imports.</p>
<h3>England Rejects US Invitation to Discuss Ruhr Coal Problem</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse London, 14th Dispatch] Regarding the US government's invitation to the United Kingdom to hold a conference in the British and American occupation zones to discuss increasing coal production in the Ruhr area and determining the new industrial levels of the British and American occupation zones, it was recently learned from responsible sources that the British government has rejected the US invitation. The British government would rather temporarily postpone discussing these issues until the European Economic Cooperation Conference is over.</p>
<h3>Differing Opinions within Japanese Cabinet on Nationalization of Coal Mines</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 15th Dispatch] The issue of national management of coal mines in Japan seems to be sufficient to affect the survival of the Katayama Cabinet. There is no complete consensus within the cabinet regarding the objects and methods of its management. Furthermore, there is a considerable distance between the proposals of the Socialist Party and the Democratic Party, and it is difficult to maintain cooperative relations with the party unless a compromise is reached. Under these circumstances, in order to seek cooperation with the party, a liaison meeting of the three factions of the party was held on the 14th, and the members of each party explained their basic opinions. Furthermore, the views of cabinet members from the Socialist and Democratic parties within the government are also different, so a compromise should be reached at this time through appropriate methods. Therefore, Nishio also participated in the liaison meeting of the three factions in the capacity of representative of the government, and it seems that considerable time will be required to reach this compromise, and it is impossible not to draw out this group meeting, otherwise it may develop into a political issue.</p>

If this change is realized, the US military will withdraw from the occupation zones, leaving only a few guards, pending the signing of a peace treaty. Several thousand military personnel in the occupation zones will be transferred to the State Department, and some departments of the State Department will also be expanded as a result.</p>
<h3>Attlee Explains India Independence Bill</h3>
<p>[Reuters London, 14th Dispatch] The House of Commons' review of the India Independence Bill has entered the committee stage. During the discussion, members requested the Prime Minister to clarify the meaning of the term "independent dominion" in the bill. Prime Minister Attlee replied that, according to the Statute of Westminster, dominion means complete independence, and declared that the wording in the India Independence Bill will not change the complete independence and autonomy of India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the discussion, Conservative member Butler declared regarding Hyderabad. He clarified that the Conservative Party does not intend to delay the bill, but there are several points that need to be clarified. Undersecretary of the Department of India and Burma, Henderson, replied that the three island groups of Andaman, Nicobar, and Laccadive will become part of the Indian dominion. The preparation for independence of these islands must seek the opinions of other related dominion governments (the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are located in the Bay of Bengal; the Laccadive Islands are located in the Arabian Sea). Berar, under the jurisdiction of the Hyderabad state, will still belong to Hyderabad.</p>
<p>Hopes for Continued Cooperation After Division of Indian Army</p>
<p>Prime Minister Attlee further explained the division of the Indian Army, saying that it was a necessary result after the partition of India, but he hoped that the two dominions could engage in the greatest cooperation in defense affairs.

<h3>Secret Gold and Dollar Black Market Busted in Triple-Housed, Multi-Gated Den on Third Floor Next to Huiluo Company on Nanjing Road; Ten People, Including Masterminds, Accomplices, and Customers, Arrested</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The police department's economic section yesterday busted a large-scale secret gold and dollar black market trading organization. This organization was meticulously arranged and acted cunningly, but it finally could not escape justice.</p>
<p>No. 88 Nanjing East Road, next to Huiluo Company at the intersection of Sichuan Road, is a three-story building. The Harris Restaurant is on the bottom floor, and the second and third floors are offices for commercial firms and companies. The staircase of this building is in the middle and never sees sunlight all year round. It is dark, winding, and quite mysterious. No. 7 on the third floor is the location of the gold and dollar organization. On weekdays, a signboard of "Hong An Securities" is hung outside the door. Unsuspecting people naturally think it is a legitimate securities firm. However, its interior is arranged like a machine, with so-called rooms within rooms and doors within doors. There are a total of five interconnected rooms. The trading place is in the innermost room, while the outer rooms are for negotiation and bargaining, and a staff member is assigned to listen to the phone and contact buyers and sellers. Transactions are made in the inner room after an agreement is reached. Customers who frequent the place are both Chinese and foreign, and they have been operating secretly for quite some time.</p>
<p>A week ago, the economic section of the police department received a secret report from an informant, informing them of this organization. They immediately dispatched officers to conduct a detailed follow-up investigation and confirmed the facts. Therefore, yesterday morning, Section Chief Xu Youzuo of the section led officers Shen Jialin, Jing Qinghai, and more than ten economic police officers to begin the operation. They departed from the police department at 11:30 a.m. and arrived at the location at 11:45 a.m. To avoid alarming the suspects, armed police temporarily ambushed downstairs, while plainclothes police officers, including Shen, pretended to be customers and entered No. 7 on the third floor, heading straight to the inner room. At this time, the staff in the outer room planned to ask them where they were going. Shen and others vaguely replied, "Looking for someone named Wang," while quickly rushing to the inner suite. By the time they arrived, the door to the inner suite was locked from the inside. Those trading inside had already heard the commotion outside and were frantically hiding gold and dollars in secret drawers. However, Section Chief Xu had already been watching the movements in this inner suite from another room where he could see, so it was clear where the gold and dollars were being hidden. At the same time, he called the armed police downstairs to come upstairs.</p>
<p>Two Telephone Lines Cut Off</p>
<p>At this time, the staff in the organization were extremely cunning and cut off two of the three privately installed intercom lines. The police discovered and prevented the remaining one from being cut. This intercom was extremely busy, with Chinese and Westerners constantly asking about the black market price of gold and dollars.</p>
<p>Under the spot search, US$4,751 in American dollars, four large gold bars, twenty-three small gold bars, three gold bracelets, twenty-one gold rings, one gold lock plate, and HK$190 in Hong Kong dollars were confiscated. In addition, three gold bracelets, one small balance scale, one diamond-studded gold plate, and one small diamond ring were found on the bodies of customers in the outer room.</p>
<p>Two Other Masterminds on the Run</p>
<p>This organization was formed by three partners: Jiang Chengqi, Huang Yaoting, and Jiang Chengliang. Huang and Jiang had already left at the time, so they were not apprehended. Mei Chengqi, the accountant Chen Lizhang, the telephone operator Ding Bingzhang, the runner Wu Guochang, customers Shen Xirong (jeweler), Xi Xianglong (trainee at the Belgian Sabena foreign firm), Du Shaoceng (clerk at the Argentine Embassy), Huang Zuhong, Lai Lesheng (trainee at the Huatai Hotel), and Zhang Gongpei were all arrested on the spot. All the suspects are currently being held in the police department's detention center for further interrogation.</p>

Finally, sixteen articles of the rules of procedure for the review of the allocation of quota raw materials were adopted.</p>

<h3>Comprehensive Income Tax May Be Applied with Lenience</h3>
<p>Regarding the comprehensive income tax, the Ministry of Finance has already instructed the Bureau of Direct Taxation to begin collecting it. According to the person in charge of the Bureau of Direct Taxation, the collection procedures are extremely complicated. The tax bureau must comprehensively assess an individual's salary income, bank deposit interest income, profits from investments in various enterprises, and rental income from an individual's real estate, such as properties and furniture. After deducting the individual's necessary family expenses, the bureau will then determine the amount of tax payable. This investigative procedure is extremely cumbersome, and it is difficult to ensure completeness. Therefore, to facilitate collection, the bureau plans to submit a simplified tax collection method to the Ministry of Finance for approval. The main points of the method are two: (1) Among civil servants, only senior personnel will be subject to comprehensive income tax. (2) For all general taxpayers in society, the bureau will request nominations from the Senate and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to select those with affluent lifestyles to be taxed.</p>
<h3>License Tax Collected in Different Grades, Finance Bureau Implemented Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Sun Yunzhang, Secretary-General of Zhejiang Provincial Government, Retried Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Sun Yunzhang, the former Secretary-General of the pseudo-Zhejiang Provincial Government, was originally sentenced to ten years. He was retried in the High Court yesterday.

During his tenure, he did not engage in any actions detrimental to the people. He later served as a member of the pseudo-Economic Commission, but this was merely a nominal position, he claimed.</p>

<h3>Mysterious Radio Station Specializing in Sending Secret Codes, Three Main Culprits Arrested, Accomplices at Large, Drug Use Suspicions Also Discovered</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The police局 recently cracked a mysterious radio station, arresting many suspects and drug users, who are currently under interrogation. The incident occurred when a police officer, on duty at a post on Zhongzheng Middle Road the other day, noticed a group of people carrying a black leather bag, looking flustered. He immediately stepped forward to inspect them and found more than 20 brown envelopes, all containing telegraphic codes (different from ordinary telegraph codes). Besides the envelopes, there was nothing else. Considering their suspicious behavior, he took them to the police局 for investigation. They identified themselves as He Rongfu from Guangdong. These letters were delivered by Feng Yuanyi from a radio station in Anlefang, Jing'an Temple Road, to Liao Xien at the radio station at 526 Zhabei Road, but he was arrested on the way. However, the contents of the codes are unknown. Subsequently, the Bureau investigated the aforementioned locations. Feng Yuanyi had already escaped, and only Liao Xien and He Hongjun, He Rongfu's father, at No. 30, Lane 359, Huashan Road, were apprehended. When searching He's home, it was discovered that He Hongjun was smoking opium. He and others were taken into custody, but the main culprit, Feng Yuanyi, is still at large, leaving the case a mystery. Whether there is political motivation or connections to underground banks is still under careful investigation by the Bureau. According to reporters' investigations, the radio station charges 5,000 yuan per word for sending telegrams on behalf of customers.</p>
<h3>Female Student's Startling Dream: Climbing Over the Wall and Entering a Lady's Chamber at Night, Proposing Marriage with a Gun, Kneeling in Supplication</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Chengde, a native of Ningbo, runs the Chengtai Construction Factory at 33 Wuyi Road. His second daughter, Chen Zhizhu, 22 years old, is intelligent and beautiful, and is currently a senior at St. John's University. A young man named Zhai Wanli, a native of Rugao, lives at No. 154, a neighboring building to the north. He is 19 years old and a freshman at Soochow University. He saw the girl's beauty and was amazed by her. When they met, they would occasionally exchange a few words, but the girl was quite reserved, and he had no way to express his admiration. On the night of the 30th of last month, driven by passion, Qu, carrying a handgun, climbed over the wall and entered Zhizhu's bedroom. The girl was awakened from her dream. Zhai knelt down on both knees and proposed to Chen. Under Zhai's threat, Chen feigned agreement at the time and tricked him into handing over the gun. The next day, the girl told her parents about what happened last night and reported it to the Changning Road Police Substation, which arrested Zhai. He was sent to the local prosecutor's office yesterday for questioning by Prosecutor Ding Tongjun. According to Zhai's confession, "I really love her, so I resorted to this tactic. I carried a handgun because I thought it was very impressive. The gun belongs to Liu Jiliang. I obtained it last year from a naval friend, Wang Kaiyuan, for 300,000 yuan as collateral. It has no license and no bullets inside." He was released on bail pending trial.</p>
<h3>Wen Lantting's Retrial Scheduled, Ji Xizong Testifies: Serving in Pseudo-Positions Was Approved on Record</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Wen Lantting, one of the "Three Old Men" of Shanghai during the enemy-puppet period, was accused of being a traitor and sentenced to eight years in prison by the High Court. After review by the Supreme Court, the case was remanded for retrial because it was necessary to investigate in detail whether Wen Lantting's appointment to the pseudo-positions was approved by the Central Government in advance or submitted for approval afterward. The case was heard in the High Court yesterday. Wen Lantting was unable to attend the trial because he was seriously ill and receiving treatment at the Red Cross Hospital on Huashan Road. His defense lawyer appeared in court on his behalf. Ji Xizong, a specialist of the Central Party Headquarters, testified that he was ordered to come to Shanghai in June of the 30th year [of the Republic] to work as a commissioner of the Central Statistics Bureau stationed in Shanghai, concurrently serving as a member of the Special Party Department of both roads. He met Wen through an introduction. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he received approval from the Central Government to further engage Wen Bantting in work, mainly to provide economic intelligence. During this period, Wen served as the chairman of the pseudo-Municipal Chamber of Commerce in January of the 31st year [of the Republic], the chairman of the pseudo-Shanghai Citizen Welfare Association on May 6th of the 32nd year [of the Republic], the chairman of the Cotton Control Association in October of the 32nd year [of the Republic], and the chairman of the pseudo-Commercial Control Association in June of the 33rd year [of the Republic], all with the approval of the Central Statistics Bureau. Because Shanghai was filled with enemy influence and the situation was extremely chaotic at that time, I used his official position to cover up underground work. At the time, Wen did retain a large amount of cotton yarn materials. In May and June of the 32nd year [of the Republic], a secret radio station was set up in Wen's house to communicate secretly with the Central Government. Detailed information can be obtained by writing to the Central Statistics Bureau for verification. After Ji finished testifying, the defense lawyer stood up and said: "The defendant is very ill and needs a caretaker to assist with urination and defecation, so he is unable to attend court. Can the court send someone to question him at his bedside to facilitate an early resolution of the case?" The court ordered that the motion be submitted for consideration.</p>
<h3>Far East International Military Tribunal Judge, Dr. Mei Ru'ao, Passes Through Shanghai, Discusses the Truth of His Driver's Arrest</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Dr. Mei Ru'ao, the Chinese judge representative of the Far East International Military Tribunal, has returned to Shanghai from Nanjing after returning to China for a work report during the tribunal's summer recess. The reporter recently met with Mr. Mei at his residence and talked about the Tokyo telegram carried in domestic newspapers on the 18th of last month regarding the arrest of Mr. Mei's car driver. Although the matter was trivial and has passed, the telegram at the time was brief, and the people of the country were unclear about the truth, leading to much speculation. Some said that the arrested driver was Chinese and the arresting military police were Japanese. Some domestic newspapers even used the headline "A Strange Incident in Tokyo", which led to the spread of misinformation and deepened misunderstandings. The reporter asked Mr. Mei about the actual situation at the time. Mr. Mei smiled and said: "This was originally a minor and accidental incident, only because the Tokyo telegram was too brief and somewhat exaggerated, which caused the concern of the people of the country. Since you asked, I will tell you the actual process of what happened at that time."</p>
<p>Mr. Mei said: "The eleven judges of the Far East International Tribunal, although nominally appointed by Macron, are actually recommended by various countries and represent their own countries. Therefore, these eleven people form a special group in Tokyo, enjoying special honors and treatment. Each person occupies a suite in the luxurious Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, including an office, a living room, and a bedroom, all equipped with air conditioning (the only residence with air conditioning in Tokyo). In addition, each judge is also allocated a latest-model sedan car by the Allied Headquarters, with national emblem markings suspended in the front and rear. The drivers are all sergeants from the 8th Army Automobile Brigade of the US Army stationed in Japan. Mr. Mei's driver is US Army Sergeant Charles. These judges' special cars are painted with red numbers, with the President of the Court being number one, the United States being number two, China being number three, England being number four, and the Soviet Union being number five. When driving through the city, even if they violate traffic rules, the military police are not allowed to stop them halfway, but only to record their number for later negotiation. This is to respect the status of the judges and avoid obstructing their official duties."</p>
<p>"Since the tribunal's opening 14 months ago, the court has convened daily at 9:30 AM. The judges take cars from their residences at 9:15 AM to the court (the old site of the Ministry of the Army), which takes about 10 minutes. At 9:15 AM on June 17th, Mr. Mei planned to go to court on time, but the driver Charles was not at the residence. The waiter searched everywhere but could not find him. It was already 9:30 AM. He called the car general management office, but they also did not know where the driver was. After further inquiries to the automobile brigade to which he belonged, it was learned that Charles had violated military regulations due to a minor matter in early March. He was summoned by the US military police headquarters at 9:00 AM that day. Charles did not inform Mei or notify the general management office to send another vehicle. After learning about it, the place sent Mr. Mei to court, but it was already after 10:00 AM. To maintain etiquette, Mr. Mei informed President Webb with a note explaining the reason for his lateness after arriving at the court. Mr. Webb thought that Mr. Mei was unhappy and expressed indignation on his behalf and announced loudly in public: 'The military police headquarters summoned the judge's driver without notifying the judge, which is close to contempt of court'. At that time, the prosecutor and the defendant's lawyer were debating and were interrupted by the trial, so the small thing became big, and the telegram was spread, known to the world."</p>
<p>Mr. Mei continued: "This matter is very trivial and accidental, but the British and Americans are accustomed to the spirit of the rule of law and respect judges, so it is not surprising. The Chinese people mistakenly thought that Mr. Mei's driver was Chinese and that the military police were Japanese, but in fact, there are no soldiers in Japan, let alone military police, and even the police are not allowed to carry guns without the permission of the Allied Headquarters."</p>
<p>The International Tribunal began its six-week recess on June 27th, lasting until August 4th. Mr. Mei is scheduled to go to Japan at the end of the month and will attend a welcome meeting for the faculty and students of the Law Society of Fudan University.</p>
<h3>Military Service Symposium, Director Xu Addresses, Suggesting Educated Youth Join the Army to Complete the Important Task of National Construction</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The military service symposium hosted by the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government was held at the department's office on Tanggu Road yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Mayor Wu attended and presided over the meeting. Xu Siping, Director of the Military Service Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, and Yin Chengzuo, Deputy Director, made a special trip from Nanjing to Shanghai to participate. After Chairman Wu reported on the significance of the symposium, Director Xu addressed the meeting, briefly stating: (1) Conscription is being carried out universally in various places this year. (2) Because Shanghai is a commercial and industrial area, the number of conscripts is relatively small. (3) Shanghai's conscription is still in its initial stages, and all preparations must be adequate, so it is later than other places, starting on August 1st. (4) The administration of military service in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas is mainly based on volunteers, with conscription as secondary. He then explained Chairman Chiang's instructions on the administration of military service, emphasizing the need to strengthen publicity efforts to ensure that every household is aware of it, and that efforts should be made to ensure fairness and strengthen the people's faith. He further explained that military service laws and regulations have been simplified, and that the military service associations in various places today are civilian organizations that assist the government in promoting military service, hoping to exert their dynamism. Xu also said: "I have suggested to the Central Government that we should launch a new campaign for educated youth to join the army to complete the important task of national construction."</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Northeast Volunteer Army, More Than Three Hundred People Arrive in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Manufacturing Fake Gold Bars, Mixing Proves Exposed, One Offender Recently Released and Arrested, One Offender Fled</h3>
<p>Pitiable Vendors' Savings Over the Years, Purchased Counterfeit Items Without Knowing Whereabouts</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Xiong Wenbin, a native of Shaoxing, is 42 years old and lives at No. 201 Zhaozhou Road in the Nanshi District. He is a coal store clerk and has always been unstable. A month ago, Xiong met his friend Shi Qinghe on the road. Shi was a craftsman at a certain jewelry store. During their conversation, Shi suddenly revealed his intention to make fake gold bars to cheat money. Xiong felt that it was profitable and was delighted by the prospect. The two immediately agreed to cooperate and decided to use Xiong's home at No. 201 Zhaozhou Road as the factory.</p>
<p>The next day, Shi brought another craftsman and necessary tools to Xiong's home and began to manufacture. The method was to make fake lead gold inlaid with silver. The gold content was 8.8 parts, and the silver content was 1.2 parts. They first made three small gold bars, each weighing one tael. Shi took them to be stamped with hard seals. Two bars were faked to be from the Lao Tianbao Jewelry Store, and one was faked to be from the Dafengheng Jewelry Store. Because their techniques were superb, the fake gold bars were difficult to distinguish from the real ones when roughly inspected.</p>
<p>Once manufactured, they found a way to mix them in. First, they pawned one to Chen Yu, the son-in-law of an old lady living at No. 100 Baishoufang, Lujiabang Road, and shared the proceeds. Half a month later, they sold the remaining two bars to Lin Zhigang, who set up a fruit stall at the entrance of Yaojianong, Zhongqun Road. However, at this time, Xiong Wenbin had been detained by the local procuratorate on suspicion of another case. Both of these fake gold bars were sold by Shi Qinghe.</p>
<p>At this time, the 4th Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters had received a confidential report that someone was manufacturing fake gold bars and sent personnel to investigate. They learned the details, but Shi Qinghe had already fled upon hearing the news. Xiong Wenbin was released by the local procuratorate on the 12th after being detained for 13 days. At 11:00 PM on the 13th, he was arrested by inspectors from the 4th Brigade at the intersection of Xijia Road and Xundaogai. After interrogation, he confessed to the above without denial. He was sent to headquarters yesterday for investigation according to law. Shi Qinghe, who is on the run, is still being actively pursued.</p>
<p>The physical evidence in this case, the three fake gold bars, are not yet fully accounted for. One of them was pawned to Chen Yu, the son-in-law of Mrs. Wei. Chen did not know it was fake and pawned it to a person named Luo Shaoyi. The other two were sold to fruit vendor Lin Zhigang. Lin stopped setting up his fruit stall after buying the fake gold bars, or may have brought the gold bars bought with his savings over the years back to his hometown. If that is the case, it would be tragic.</p>

<h3>An Accomplice of the Enemy Army in Dongyang County, Jiang Wenkui, Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Jiang Wenkui, the Deputy Leader of the Intelligence Group of the Enemy's Military Police in Dongyang, was sentenced by the High Court yesterday: "Jiang Wenkui, for conspiring with the enemy to rebel against this country, is sentenced to life imprisonment, with the deprivation of civil rights for life, and all property, except for the necessary living expenses for family members, is confiscated." Jiang is 37 years old, resides at No. 147, Kaifeng Road, in this city, and has no fixed occupation.

<h3>Soviet Evacuation Ship Unauthorizedly Carried Cargo and Passengers to Shanghai: Violates Our National Shipping Rights; Awaiting Central Government Instructions Before Deciding; First Batch of Evacuees Expected in Early August</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Soviet citizens in this city will be repatriated. It is learned that the formalities for the first batch of 1,000 people returning to their country will be completed within three days. The Soviet Consulate General plans to send them back to their country between August 1st and August 5th. The evacuation ship "Eriklik" arrived in Shanghai on the 12th. According to reports from relevant sources: the ship, when coming to Shanghai from Dalian, carried cargo and passengers without our consent. Among the passengers were six Taiwanese and two children who boarded in Dalian, as well as a British businessman. Except for the American who had a passport, the others had no supporting documents. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and relevant authorities believe that it is a violation of our national shipping rights for foreign ships to carry cargo and passengers from one place to another within Chinese territory without the consent of the Chinese authorities. At the same time, the list of crew members was not approved by our consulate when the ship departed from Vladivostok to China, which is also inappropriate. However, the authorities in this city have not yet made any specific statement on this case and will make a decision after receiving instructions from the central government.</p>
<p>Luxurious and Splendid: Unseen in the Philippines</p>
<p>The "Eriklik" will carry a small number of Chinese and Soviet diplomats back to Vladivostok in the next one or two days and will return to Shanghai again at the end of this month to then transport the evacuees. This ship is a German war prize obtained by the Soviet Union during the war. It is an extremely luxurious and modern passenger ship, weighing 22,000 tons, with a capacity of approximately 2,000 passengers. The ship is well-equipped, unusually comfortable, with a dance hall, grand dining room, swimming pool, and first-class cabins with suites including rooms for living, bathrooms, and servants, much like a small apartment. It is even more luxurious than the American President's ship, which can be called one of the most impressive vessels ever seen.</p>
<p>Moutai Agency: Import Procedures</p>
<p>Before the war, import and export and customs declaration procedures for Soviet ships in Shanghai were handled by the Hongyun Company. After the resumption of navigation after the victory, it is now handled by the Transportation Department of Moutai Foreign Firm. Therefore, the import and export procedures of the "Eriklik" are also handled by this firm, while the registration of evacuation tickets is handled by the Tongjilong Foreign Firm on behalf of the Soviet Consulate General.</p>
<h3>Restoring Prosperity to Nanshi: Repairing All Docks</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Nanshi Dock Restoration Committee held its seventh meeting yesterday afternoon at the Public Works Bureau, chaired by Zhao Zengjue. According to Director Zhao's statement to reporters after the meeting: There are a total of 18 docks in Nanshi. After receiving them, the Public Works Bureau is repairing them for use separately.

In addition, docks No. 5 to No. 9 are being actively rushed to completion and are expected to be completed by mid-August.</p>
<p>As for whether the docks after No. 9 will continue to be repaired, it will depend on whether funds are sufficient, as the cost of building docks is considerable, with a total capital of approximately 12 billion yuan required. If funds are sufficient, docks No. 9 to No. 13 are expected to be completed before the end of this year. As for docks No. 13 to No. 18, they will have to be continued next year. After all 18 docks in Nanshi are repaired and put into use, the original state before the war will be restored, and the prosperity of Nanshi can be expected in the near future.</p>

<h3>Manager of Huakang Money Shop; Repeated Summonses Ignored, Arrest to Follow</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] On May 15th, Chairman Chiang telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, stating that according to reports, Huakang Company at No. 6, Qujiangli, Hankou Road, Fujian Road, Shanghai, is an underground money shop, managed by Xue Bolin, from Shaoxing, which issues checks to the outside, with deposit interest of 1.5 cents and lending interest of 2 cents, colluding with Yihua Bank and Lichang Money Shop to engage in stock speculation, with a daily turnover of up to 50 million yuan, and instructed the Ministry of Finance to investigate. After thorough investigation by the Audit Office of the Central Bank and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, it was found that Huakang Company ostensibly engages in the pigment industry, but has neither joined the guild nor registered with the Social Affairs Bureau.

<h3>Education Symposium; Only Discussed Higher Education Issues Yesterday; Decided to Extend the Meeting by Half a Day to Continue Discussion Today</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The education symposium convened by the Ministry of Education held group meetings on the morning of the 15th. The Higher Education Group was chaired by Wu Yifang. The Secondary Education Group was chaired by Cheng Shiyu. The Social Education Group was chaired by Ying Ganli. The Comprehensive Group discussed urgent education issues, such as the low salaries of national teachers and other urgent issues not belonging to the above three groups. The meeting adjourned at noon. In the afternoon, the general meeting was chaired by Zhu Jiahua and discussed higher education issues. The chairman of the Higher Education Group reported on the group meeting, followed by speeches by more than 20 people, including Wu Yifang, Ou Yuanhuai, Cha Liangjian, Yuan Dunli, Cheng Shiyu, and Yu Xiaocang. As a result, two major cases were resolved regarding higher education: (1) How to cultivate a good academic atmosphere. It was resolved that the occurrence of student unrest was due to the unrest in the current situation and the bad social atmosphere, and the responsibility does not only lie with education. In the future, all parties should actively cultivate a good academic atmosphere to eliminate student unrest, guide students onto the right track, and pay attention to the following points: (a) Increase academic interest, encourage academic research, and enrich teaching and living facilities, and improve the treatment of teachers; (b) Implement the combination of training and education. In addition to the Training Committee and the Training Department being responsible, the deans and department heads should also be responsible for training, and professors should be asked to be jointly responsible at any time; (c) When students pay attention to and study national politics, they should develop correct political concepts, cultivate a democratic style, and practice democratic procedures. However, students should concentrate on their studies during their studies and should not engage in actual political activities, let alone overstep the bounds, affecting the school and social order. The Training Committee and the Training Department should actively guide student autonomy activities, especially to arouse their sense of responsibility for their views and behaviors. (2) The issue of distinguishing between the nature of vocational schools and universities. It was resolved that: (a) Vocational schools aim to cultivate practical talents, and universities aim to study advanced academics and cultivate specialized talents. The goals are different, and the nature is naturally different. They should still be established separately according to the statutory purpose; (b) Vocational school graduates should also be awarded degrees, the names of which will be considered later; (c) At present, university education should focus on enriching content and should not be expanded without a plan or preparation. The discussion adjourned at 7 pm, and the issues of the Secondary Education, Social Education, and Comprehensive groups were not discussed. It was decided to extend the meeting by half a day and continue the discussion on the morning of the 16th before closing the meeting.</p>

<h3>Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee Stipulates Supplementary Measures for Joint Yarn Allocation - Priority Allocation to Local Mills for Advance Orders from Out-of-Town Mills - Purchase Price of Yarn Spun by Executive Yuan's Flower Allocation Office Determined</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch] The Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee has stipulated four supplementary measures for the joint allocation and sale of cotton yarn, and the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association has sent letters to its member factories to inform them. The contents of these measures are as follows: (1) Advance orders for yarn submitted by out-of-town yarn mills should be given priority for allocation to local or nearby counties for the re-manufacturing industry. Customers should hold an advance order stamped with the seal of the Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee and pay the price at the business location of each factory to obtain a warehouse receipt for picking up the goods. After allocating yarn according to this principle, each factory should transport any remaining yarn to Shanghai, and first designate a delivery location. (2) During the effective period specified in the advance order, customers should complete the purchase procedures at each factory within the specified period. Failure to do so will result in the order being voided. (3) Each yarn mill should stamp the returned advance order with a stamp indicating that the warehouse receipt has been issued and the date, and send it to the Sixth District Association for record. (4) Advance order coupons for which customers have not completed purchase procedures by the deadline should be submitted by the customer to the Spinning and Weaving Construction Company for transfer to this committee for verification. Furthermore, regarding the fourth item of returning warehouse receipts, the Sixth District Association has recently sent a letter to its customers requesting that they submit a copied form to the association for verification when returning the receipts.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the purchase price of yarn spun by the Executive Yuan's Flower Allocation Office in April, May, and June, the Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee has calculated and determined the purchase price for each count of yarn, with each type of yarn divided into five grades for pricing. 20-count A is 6.5 million yuan, B is 6.34 million yuan, C is 6.17 million yuan, D is 6.01 million yuan, and E is 5.85 million yuan. 21-count A is 6.75 million yuan, B is 6.58 million yuan, C is 6.41 million yuan, D is 6.24 million yuan, and E is 6.07 million yuan. 22-count A is 7.06 million yuan, B is 6.88 million yuan, C is 6.72 million yuan, D is 6.53 million yuan, and E is 6.35 million yuan. 32-count A is 9.56 million yuan, B is 9.32 million yuan, C is 9.08 million yuan, D is 8.84 million yuan, and E is 8.6 million yuan.</p>
<p>[Further Report] The Pricing and Finished Product Sales Task Force meeting was not held yesterday due to unforeseen circumstances. It is expected that the outline of the entire yarn and cloth adjustment plan will be announced today.</p>
<h3>Yarn Allocation Will Be Under Unified Distribution - Rumors of Cotton Cloth Purchases Are False</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] A person in charge of the re-manufacturing industry and cotton cloth business met with Mr. Liu Siying, the acting chairman of the Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee, yesterday to discuss the implementation plan for adjusting the supply of yarn and cloth, to present opinions, and to request instructions on policies. It is reported that the following points were discussed.</p>
<p>(1) The joint allocation of cotton yarn has increased in quantity. However, the restrictions imposed by the Spinning and Weaving Construction Company due to the weak yarn source in the past have not been lifted. A request was made for a reasonable amendment. For example, there are hundreds of small factories, and the Spinning and Weaving Construction Company has not allowed them to participate in yarn allocation because of their small equipment and limited manpower. Nine re-manufacturing industry associations have submitted written proposals requesting group allocation, but they have not been approved. Taking only the Tianjin factories as an example, there are about 600 looms. Forcing them to rely on the black market is detrimental to adjustment. Furthermore, cloth factories in Wuxi, Changzhou, Wuxian, and Changshu only participated in yarn allocation last month. However, the factories in the suburbs of this city have not yet received allocation. This is also an unreasonable disparity. Mr. Liu attached great importance to this and promised to make unified distribution.</p>
<p>(2) In principle, there is no problem with custom spinning and weaving. However, it is hoped that the key points can be grasped for the custom weaving method. The patterns and grades of goods are inconsistent, and management is not easy. If custom weaving is carried out across the board, the government may not be able to penetrate so deeply into the private sector, and the re-manufacturing industry will have the suffering of wanting to stop but not being able to. Recently, the cotton cloth market has caused rumors of cotton cloth purchases. Public sentiment is uneasy, which is contrary to the original intention of adjustment. A request was made for clear instructions. Mr. Liu stated that the government will never do this and hoped that the industry would be informed to rest assured. Regarding the custom weaving method, due to the complexity of the matter, a more detailed discussion will be held on another day.</p>
<p>(3) The allocation and sale of cotton cloth will be one aspect of the adjustment measures. However, it is not the same as the Great Rear Area during the War of Resistance, with a vast area and connected trade routes. It will be difficult to be thorough with universal direct allocation and sale. Furthermore, auxiliary institutions are insufficient, and social survey statistics are lacking. What the government puts out may not necessarily be what the people receive. It is hoped that the focus will be on the big picture and that a serious effort will be made. Mr. Liu said that the trend of speculation and hoarding must be stopped. Equitable distribution and benefits must be directly accessible to the public. He promised to discuss the method in detail again and asked that industry support be conveyed in principle.</p>
<p>(4) The implementation plan for adjusting the supply of yarn and cloth is related to the nation's economic plan, the lifeline of industrial production, and the commercial sales standards. It is hoped that the opinions of the re-manufacturing industry and the cotton cloth industry will be valued to seek sincere cooperation between the government and business, and between production and sales. Mr. Liu expressed his pleasure at this and solemnly stated that the government is doing things for the people and is very willing for the relevant industries and businesses to have practical methods for adoption. He promised to convene a forum with the responsible persons of the yarn and cloth industry within a few days to gather wisdom and benefit from each other.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Fluctuations Minimal - Factory-Managed Silk Fabrics Are Generally Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of artificial silk did not change. It was weaker at the opening but recovered to a high level, similar to the previous day's price. 120-count Takayama Yuko was initially offered at 27 million yuan, and there was no lack of absorption at low prices, which led to an increase. The closing price at noon was 7.5 million yuan, and the final opening price in the afternoon was 7.8 million yuan. The prices of Toyo and Tianqiao were also no different from the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, factory-managed silk fabrics were still weak. Although the wartime price of high uniformity was similar to the previous day, there were no transactions. Several medium-grade small lots were offered at prices between 30 million and 100 million yuan. High-grade small lots were offered at 32 million yuan, and there were also transactions. The quoted price of dry warp did not move, and there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, silk fabrics were unusually soft due to falling raw material prices and limited actual sales. Bed covers and checkered crepe uniformly plummeted. The lowest price for Dachen bed covers was 1.45 million yuan, but then it improved slightly, selling for 1.55 million yuan. The lowest price for Huaqiang bed covers was 1.4 million yuan, and then it traded for 1.45 million yuan. Dachen checkered crepe opened at 37,500 yuan, and finally fell to 6,700 yuan. The next-day price was 6,900 yuan. All other goods were weak. High-end Huajin crepe traded for 25,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Export Promotion Committee Discusses Silk Export Issues</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held a regular meeting yesterday morning, chaired by Chen Guangfu. The issue of silk exports was discussed in detail at yesterday's meeting, but no conclusion was reached. The meeting will continue to be held from 4:00 PM this afternoon to make a final conclusion.</p>
<h3>Weak Cotton Market Clearing Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot cotton transactions were scarce, and the market was very weak. The industry's sentiment was weakened due to tight money and falling yarn and cloth prices. Yesterday, yarn mills and customer associations' absorption was relaxed, and the amount of chips on the market suddenly became abundant, and prices also rebounded slightly. The price offered for delivery to factories was 2.07 million yuan for Guide cotton. The warehouse delivery price was 2.02 million yuan, 2.2 million yuan, 2.22 million yuan, 2.25 million yuan, 2.26 million yuan, and 2.27 million yuan for Lingbao cotton. Guide cotton was 1.96 million yuan, 2.03 million yuan, and 2.07 million yuan. Zhoupu seed cotton was 345,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Rice Sales - Japonica and Indica Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 3,500 piculs of rice arrived in the North and South markets, and sales were extremely sluggish. There were no buyers, and Japonica and Indica rice continued to plummet by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. White rice also fell by another 100,000 to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour sales were strong, plunging by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Bran was also reduced by 1,000 yuan. Bean cake sales also weakened accordingly, falling back by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Yingkou cake plummeted by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Soybean buyers remained unmoved, and local views turned negative, falling by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Wanzhe South Seas absorption continued, gradually soaring, rising by 10,000 yuan. Both domestic and foreign sales of broad beans were sluggish, and sources continued to arrive, falling by another 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Corn, on the other hand, moved slightly in the North, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, while medium grades remained flat.</p>
<p>There were very few transactions of raw peanuts, and prices fell by 10,000 yuan. Sesame was the only one that stood out, rising by another 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Garbanzo beans remained stable.</p>
<p>Shantou continued to fluctuate. Vegetable oil fell by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan due to the Guangzhou buyers stopping. Raw oil and soybean oil rose by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan as Ningbo buyers took delivery. Sesame oil remained flat, while Qing sesame oil was firm.</p>
<h3>Rediscount Committee Approves Loans - Total Amount 8.5 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The 16th regular meeting of the Rediscount Committee of the Central Bank was held at 3:00 PM on the 15th in the conference room of the committee. Fourteen people, including Qin Runqing, Pan Shouheng, and Wu Kejia, attended. Applications for industrial loans totaling 42 cases and 4 reconsideration cases, totaling more than 10.8 billion yuan, were discussed. 44 cases, totaling 7.32 billion yuan, were approved.

<h3>Principles for Wheat Loans Changed</h3>
<p>Some Flour Mills Change to In-Kind Loans</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] It is reported that the principles for wheat loans, which have been brewing for a long time, have been determined, but approval for late transport has not been obtained. It is now heard that the original lending principles have been changed again. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Wheat loans will continue to be handled as before. Except for the five major flour mills in the Fourth District Flour Industry Association, Fuxin, Maoxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, and Yutong, the original principle was to loan 1 billion yuan to other factories with a daily output of 1,000 bags. It has now been decided to change to in-kind loans. Detailed methods are awaiting final approval at the Nanjing Joint Office meeting this Thursday.</p>
<p>(2) The government will separately handle wheat purchase loans of 300 billion yuan. The Grain Department will entrust flour mills in various districts to handle wheat purchases with this fund. It is heard that the five factories, including Fuxin, account for more than 50% of the 300 billion yuan loan.</p>
<p>(3) The Gongji Office is a joint organization of the five factories, including Xin, and acting as an agent for the Grain Department to purchase wheat is part of the office's business.</p>
<h3>Securities Firm Registration - Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders to Stop</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has instructed the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the Shanghai Securities Commercial Association has issued an order stating that the nature of securities firms is to apply for registration with social organizations in accordance with the Company Law or the Commercial Registration Law. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has instructed the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to state that the association has not yet been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and that securities firms are engaged in business operations. Except for brokers who have been approved by the Shanghai Securities Exchange, who can apply for registration in accordance with the Company Law or the Commercial Registration Law, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has not approved the registration of brokers who are not securities exchanges but are engaged in the above business. If the reports are true, the registration of non-broker securities firms should be suspended, pending proper planning before further instructions are issued.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Continue to Fall Broadly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market was filled with selling cries, and buyers hesitated. Some buyers sought to enter at low prices, but buying interest was not strong, leading to a sharp decline in the market. In the afternoon, it was also heard that China Tobacco Company would also distribute "Quanlu Axe" brand cigarettes, and the market situation became even more downstream. As a result, ten-pack British cigarettes continued to fall sharply by 420,000 yuan per case compared to the previous day, falling to 8.32 million yuan. Old Knife cigarettes also fell sharply by 320,000 yuan to 7.18 million yuan. Five Flowers also fell by more than 100,000 yuan. The prices of other merchant cigarettes, such as Mei Li Jin Shu, Quanlu, Double Axe, Brandy, and Red Gold, all fell uniformly by 800 to 2,500 yuan per carton. Fifty-pack Jialike and Three-Five cigarettes also fell by 1,500 to 2,500 yuan per tin. However, the prices of American cigarettes, such as Morris, Six-Root, and Camel, remained stable due to the lack of supply.</p>
<h3>The Stock Market in China Remains Stable: Yong Yarn Experiences Initial Weakness but Recovers</h3>
<p>The China stock market showed some fluctuations yesterday. Yong Yarn shares initially struggled and appeared to be on the verge of collapse. Retail investors engaged in short selling early in the day but covered their positions before the close, resulting in mixed gains and losses. Xinyi and Maya shares, driven by competition between the yarn and stock certificate groups, were actively traded and experienced significant gains, likely due to the potential for increased stock bonuses. Among the smaller stocks, only Xinguang showed activity, while the rest remained stable. Among miscellaneous stocks, Xin Ya experienced the largest drop, while the others showed mixed performance. Overall, the stock market initially weakened due to tight credit conditions but stabilized as credit eased.</p>
<p>In the morning, the market opened lower due to significant differences in interbank lending rates from the previous day, causing anxiety among investors. When trading of Yong Yarn shares began, there was a large volume of supply, causing the price to fall to 98.50 yuan. Although the price was later pulled up to 103.00 yuan, shares numbered 185, 156, 76, and 36 were sold again at 101.00 yuan. Shares numbered 223, 71, 219, and 171 were bought continuously, showing some struggle, while shares numbered 85, 76, 65, 157, 69, and 102 were sold again at 99.50 yuan. Shares numbered 177, 85, and 129 were bought on the dip, while share 117, despite frequent short selling, easily rose to around 111.00 yuan. Eventually, at 11:00 AM, Yong Yarn shares fell to 97.00 yuan due to aggressive selling by shares numbered 117, 104, 102, 50, 153, 12, 223, and 169. However, trading in Yong Yarn shares was thin, with the lowest price only reaching 97.00 yuan. Subsequently, Xinyi shares were aggressively bought by shares numbered 224, 14, and 162, causing a sudden surge, and Maya shares also quickly rebounded after being bought by shares numbered 231 and 91. Investor sentiment quickly turned positive, and Yong Yarn shares were bought by shares numbered 157, 105, 2231, 180, 177, 154, 73, and 218 to reach 102.50 yuan. Shares numbered 157, 223, 117, and 172 briefly sold small amounts at 99.80 yuan, while shares numbered 231, 117, 185, 156, 65, 223, 14, 152, 183, and 203 actively bought in. Share 230 even bought cash Yong Yarn shares, causing the price to rise to a high of 104.80 yuan and 102.30 yuan at 12:15 PM. After shares numbered 218, 169, 82, and 232 sold off, share 171 also offered cash Yong Yarn shares, causing a slight retreat to around 102.50 yuan. The market closed at 103.20 yuan at noon, and bid prices remained stable after the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, spot Yong Yarn shares, Xinguang, and Qinxing shares rose slightly. China France shares remained flat, while Hua Feng and Jingfu shares declined slightly. Xinyi and Maya shares each rose by more than 50%, while Yonggong shares fell by 50%, Xin Ya shares fell by 10%, and Lianan shares fell by 50%. Wuhe Innerwear shares declined slightly. Datong Cement and Tongyi shares remained flat, while China Silk, Jing Car, and Match shares rose slightly. Commerce and Rongfeng shares each rose by around 50%. In Shanghai-traded shares, Xinyi rose by more than 50%, Maya rose by 50%, and Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing shares rose slightly. Yong Yarn and Yonggong shares declined slightly, while Hua Feng shares fell slightly. Off-market old shares such as Dasheng, Huashang, and Huacheng rose by 50%, while the rest remained stable.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Experience Another Decline; Foreign Stocks Show Mixed Performance</h3>
<p>Government bonds declined again yesterday after the Chamber of Commerce's proposal for repaying government bonds at multiple times their face value was rejected by the Ministry of Finance, causing a shock to investor confidence. However, there was still some buying interest after the decline. Unified C bonds opened at 68.00 yuan in the morning, reached a high of 71.00 yuan, a low of 65.00 yuan, and closed at 68.00 yuan. Rund and Room 503 offered supply, while Rooms 552 and 358 selected. Trading volume was around 2 million. As a result, compared to the previous day, Class A, B, and D bonds each fell by 700 yuan, Unified C bonds fell by 1,000 yuan, and Unified E bonds also fell slightly by 900 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks showed mixed performance yesterday. Yisha opened at 7 and rose to 71500 yuan to close. Although foreign buyers acquired, the concentration of funds from Northern banks and gangs was not large. Compared to the previous close, paper stocks rose slightly and generally reported slight declines. Trading was sluggish, and the process was 10,000 yuan, with the lowest price being 69,000 yuan, split between Ping Tang.</p>
<h3>First Silkworm Cocoon Loan of the Year: Over 8.8 Billion Yuan for Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces; Shanghai Region to Begin Signing Contracts This Morning</h3>
<p>The China Farmers Bank's first round of spring cocoon silk reeling loans for Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is estimated to be 8.87576 billion yuan, covering 77 manufacturers, including 24 in Zhejiang, with a total loan amount of 4.1008 billion yuan; 46 in Wuxi, with a total loan amount of 3.488904 billion yuan; 3 in Suzhou, with a total loan amount of 617.28 million yuan; and 4 in Shanghai, with a total loan amount of 668.64 million yuan.</p>
<p>The highest loan amount is over 860 million yuan, and the lowest is 15 million yuan. The bank has issued notices to its branches in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places on the 15th to process the loans immediately, and the Shanghai region is scheduled to begin signing contracts on the morning of the 16th.</p>
<p>Silk Reeling Trade Association Schedules Meeting to Discuss Important Matters</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Third District Silk Reeling Industry Association is scheduled to hold a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the Bank Club at 3:00 PM today. It is reported that the meeting will focus on the following two items: (1) The Wuxi County Council's request to replace the person in charge of the local silkworm cocoon production and sales association. During the handling of this year's spring silkworm purchase, the association decided on the rice price based on the ratio of four dans of rice for one dan of cocoons. However, the rice price fluctuated during the purchase, causing significant losses to silkworm farmers. They are now unanimously requesting compensation and the replacement of the person in charge of the silk cocoon guidance association stationed in the county. The meeting will discuss solutions.</p>
<p>(2) This year's spring cocoon processing factories originally hoped that the authorities would allow them to deduct 10% for their own original advances and 10% for legal profits from the raw silk processed, and actually pay 80% of the total silk reeling amount. However, this request has been rejected by the Four Joint Offices and will also be submitted for discussion.</p>
<h3>Customs Fees Increase Fourfold</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Jianghai Customs has announced that, starting today, all customs fees (including miscellaneous fees at this port) will be collected at four times the current amount.</p>
<h3>Foreign Tea Merchants Active; Export of Tianzong Fine Eyebrow Tea</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] According to tea magnate Mr. Zhu, China's tea exports to France and Morocco each year are considerable, but due to the inverted price differential between domestic and foreign sales, exports have long been sluggish and unable to flourish. Recently, the French-owned Yongxing Foreign Firm in this city, in order to actively expand its market, has been selling overseas regardless of cost. It is reported that they have already negotiated the sale of 900 tons of Fine Eyebrow green tea to that region, with delivery expected by mid-August at the latest. The price is extremely low, at only about 47 cents per pound in US dollars.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, 14th] Zhejiang tea sales had previously stalled due to prices being below cost, leading to factory closures. It is now learned that the French-owned Yongxing Foreign Firm plans to export large quantities to Morocco, so the market price has increased to over 400,000 yuan. Tea merchants' request for an additional 180,000 yuan subsidy from the China Trust Bureau has failed, so they are now trending towards free trade. Last year's tea stocks can now be sold, and tea merchants are optimistic, so tea factories have generally resumed operations.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Recently, in the foreign tea market, in addition to special grade, Fine Eyebrow, and tribute green teas being sold actively, local exporters have also been inquiring about low-grade black teas and scented teas, causing the market to gradually become more active and sentiment to improve. However, transactions remain sparse as sellers insist on their prices. As for various domestic sales teas, sales continue to be strong, and the market is stable with little movement, with a continuing positive outlook.</p>
<h3>Golden Needle Mushrooms Decline in Price</h3>
<p>Since the new golden needle mushrooms entered the market, there have been continuous arrivals, but sales have been slow, causing prices to gradually decline. Goods previously priced at 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan are now selling for less than 900,000 yuan, a drop of more than 30%.</p>
<p>Buyers Wait and See, Bulls Sell Off; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Plunge; 42-count Blue Phoenix Falls Below 20 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a sudden tightening of credit, causing buyers to wait and see. Bulls sold off one after another, and news that the Shenxin Factory had released 20-count Double Horse yarn further dampened sentiment, causing the market to continue to decline. Finally, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell below the 20 million mark, reaching a low of 18.7 million yuan, a sharp drop of 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse yarn also fell slightly to 12 million yuan, a drop of 800,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn was 10.9 million yuan, also down 800,000 yuan. The remaining 16-count Guangming Tiannv, 10-count Tong and Jun, and 32-count Blue Phoenix Silver Moon and other coarse and fine yarns all fell by varying amounts of 200,000 to over 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market was also affected by tight credit conditions, with large off-market players selling off. In addition, the general floating bulls were concerned that the authorities were strictly investigating warehouses, causing small white cloths to plunge by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Furthermore, the Textile Construction Company's cloth sales had a large amount of chips, resulting in an oversupply in the market and further weakening market sentiment. As a result, 12-pound Longtou, Wufu, Blue Chicken, and Yanghe fine cloths all fell by 17,000 to 25,000 yuan. Bleached cloth and yuan serge also fell by over 10,000 yuan, while dark-colored cloth, blue cloth, and shilin cloth markets remained stable.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Company Cloth Sales</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The China Textile Construction Company sold a total of 10,120 bolts of cloth yesterday, as usual, with a total of 309 purchase orders. 18 manufacturer customers purchased 1,320 bolts, and 291 cloth dealers purchased 8,800 bolts.</p>
<h3>Soap Sales Increase, Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's daily necessities market saw a sharp decline. The initial asking price for Huang Xiangmao soap was 340,000 yuan, but there were few buyers. The selling pressure increased at noon, and the price fell to 335,000 yuan, with some fellow traders engaging in mutual transactions. Trading was even more sluggish in the afternoon market. As a result, Xiangmao soap fell to 325,000 yuan, a drop of 16,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Guben soap also fell slightly to 470,000 yuan, a drop of 20,000 yuan. Jiandao soap fell by 15,000 yuan to 460,000 yuan. The remaining Guanghua, Niupai, Dingfeng, and other soaps all fell by 5,000 to 45,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The match market also declined, and trading was exceptionally thin. Meili, Fenghuang, Nanjing, Ningbo, and other brands all saw declines of 20,000 to 40,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Government Procurement of Export Goods: Determined Not to Unduly Suppress Prices</h3>
<p>Exporters Often Unwilling to Provide Actual Costs</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] After the Central Trust Bureau began purchasing tung oil and bristles on behalf of the government, the general sentiment in the local export community was that the purchase prices were too low. At the same time, they hoped for two things: (1) Do not purchase in the production areas domestically; (2) Continue to entrust or resell to exporters for export, so as to maintain the business operations of general exporters.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter consulted a person in charge of the Central Trust Bureau on this matter. The person said that the Central Trust Bureau is carrying out the government's orders and has no subjective opinions on the purchase itself. The purchase prices are determined by the Purchase and Export Commodities Price Review Committee, which carefully consults and decides on the basis of accurate quotations from various places every day, so there is absolutely no undue suppression of prices. Furthermore, national banks and bureaus are doing their best to facilitate the financing of domestic and foreign transportation and sales of export commodities. For example, exporters can first obtain acceptance when purchasing in production areas, and can also handle mortgage lending when export commodities are being transported to various export commodity distribution centers, and can also handle packaging loans when exporting. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that all the funds used in the transportation and sale of export commodities are provided by national banks and bureaus. However, general exporters are unwilling to provide the actual costs of export commodities. Even when financing is urgently needed due to inconvenient capital turnover, they insist that market prices be used as the standard. Otherwise, they will hold onto the goods and not sell them in order to obtain windfall profits from occasional exchange rate changes. Therefore, he hopes that all exporters can start from the perspective of using government funds in the past, and they will naturally not regard the current purchase prices set by the government as unreasonable. As for the two suggestions made by exporters to have exporters act as agents for foreign sales, the Central Trust Bureau is very willing to consider them and is currently being discussed by relevant parties.</p>

<p>A Tense Scene Simultaneously, "Armed guards were stationed around the residence of Li Weihan, (Chairman of the Zhen'an County Council)," "The Chairman (several duties, one after another (went out from home) to observe, but were prohibited from moving by the County Magistrate's guards," "Senator Zhu Benlian came out of Li's house, and was also forbidden at the door," "The County Magistrate said to his three guards, Don't let these four (forbidden at the Chairman's door) move, if they move, shoot them!" ...</p>
<p>Another Scene: "The Chairman (in the house) finished eating, took a cigarette, and went to stroll on the street, just arrived at the door, heard the County Magistrate's guards say: "Don't move, the County Magistrate's orders!" Then the County Magistrate came, slapped the Chairman twice, the County Magistrate fired a shot, and said "Why don't you (referring to the guards) fire?" The Chairman ran backwards, and a pile of blood flowed in front of the back door, and he collapsed in the vegetable garden." At this time, "Guards fired randomly from all sides." "When the County Magistrate fired, shots rang out from all around, as if one call brought a hundred responses." Among the four people forbidden in front of the door, a certain worker named Zhang Dongcheng was shot to death, Senator "Zhu Benlian was shot in the left leg and escaped into a civilian residence, fortunately preserving his life." "(The Chairman's) worker Wang Dekun (from home) fled to a mile outside the South Gate, and the County Magistrate ordered people to chase and shoot him." ...</p>
<p>Furthermore, at that time, "County Council Secretary Wan Wuying heard gunshots from within the council, and saw police officers swarming in, so he fled to a certain civilian residence, the County Magistrate ordered the Police Chief to lead police to search Wan's house without success, and then searched civilian residences everywhere, and finally captured Secretary Wan, tied him up and brought him to the County Government, and then dragged him to Chairman Li's residence. At around 9 PM, the County Magistrate ordered (Wan) to be dragged to Chairman Li's corpse to be shot!"</p>
<p>Four Dead, One Injured</p>
<p>——This is how the Zhen'an bloodshed of four deaths and one injury occurred. To ears long numbed by news of chopping and killing, four lives may not be "stimulating" enough, "Sun Junbo, as the County Magistrate, is responsible for guiding democracy, should respect public opinion to lay the foundation for constitutional governance, but instead used his power to shoot and kill Li Weihan, the head of the representative body, and Secretary Wan Wuying, etc., should be given an aggravated punishment according to the law." These few aphorisms in the verdict can be supplemented by the lament of Judge Xu Zhiyuan: "The occurrence of this bloodshed is not only the misfortune of the victims, but also the misfortune of the nation, which is preparing for constitutional governance!" Therefore, the malice of his crimes, its background, its breeding ground, its conditions, and even its teachings, all deserve attention.</p>
<p>Multi-Angle Grinding</p>
<p>Of course, the sensational point of this case, and in reality the fuse of the bloodshed, lies in the existence of a 26-year-old female teacher, Wang Huimin. Sun said that his "marriage" with her was legal, but those who witnessed the "ceremony" said it was no more than a declaration of cohabitation, and the judge used even clearer words in the indictment and judgment: "Rape." No matter what, she lived "in cohabitation" in the County Government for two months and died of poisoning, adding a "sexual tragedy" to this era's tragedy. But this interlude was not solely performed by her. Like Jin Ba's existence without appearing in Cao Yu's "Sunrise," Lu Ling or Wang Min's fate was clearly due to coercion. Inside and outside the courtroom, we heard enough on one hand of blaming bureaucratic politics, and on the other of cursing local bullies and evil gentry; parents blaming others for poisoning their daughters, and the "son-in-law" satirizing the "father-in-law" for wanting to sell his daughter, and even wanting to demand 800 million yuan for her death. Although the events are complex and subtle, when combined, they are nothing more than the conflict between officials and gentry, plus the multi-angle grinding between paternal power and "husband" power, which are equally limitless. Thus, including her, five lives were sacrificed without words!</p>
<p>Sexual Crime Case Transformed</p>
<p>This was originally at most a sexual crime case, but it quickly transformed. Because at that time, people in Zhen'an used various names to expose Sun's corruption and illegal acts to the Shaanxi Provincial Government; another case said that Sun had forced Wang Xiaolan to divorce Jia Zishan; and Wang Huimin's father also accused Sun and the Fan couple of abduction and murder in court. These cases, when combined, were indeed quite shocking. Furthermore, because the Zhen'an County Council and the province's senators in the county unanimously revealed Sun's behavior; and the documentary evidence that Wang was divorced due to Sun's pressure was said to have been forced by Chairman Li to have the witness sign and seal, Sun deeply hated the County Council and the few central figures who opposed him.</p>
<p>Murderous Trap</p>
<p>At the end of April, the Provincial Government agreed to the request of the Zhen'an County Council and sent a special commissioner, Ma Zhuoran, to Zhen'an to secretly investigate on the ground. If he had handled it well, things would not have deteriorated so badly. Unexpectedly, before he entered the county, County Magistrate Sun knew about it and sent a special person out of the city to greet him respectfully. After arriving in the city, he sent people in the name of protection, but in reality to monitor him, and also met with Ma every night to provoke and instigate him. Sun very cleverly said: "Chairman Li wants to assassinate you, Commissioner Ma," who would have thought that Ma would indeed fall into Sun's trap and turn into a joint hatred of Chairman Li and Secretary Wan? Things had reached this point, "Sun Junbo realized that Ma could help him with his plan to kill people, and became even more active." He first fabricated martial law on April 30 as preparation for the killing. At 5 PM the next day, Sun and Ma went to find the Chairman together, Sun fired the first shot at the Chairman in front of Li's residence, and Inspector Ma was also present. The judge sentenced Ma as an accomplice to murder, based on these points. Sun's actions that afternoon were, of course, stimulated by receiving the telegram from the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs suspending him from duty and awaiting investigation due to the case at noon that day.</p>
<p>Private Shackling</p>
<p>Female Lead Wang Huimin Arrives in Zhen'an</p>
<p>Wang Huimin was originally in Xi'an, Sun Junbo claimed that she was his ten-year lover, and she went to Zhen'an in December of this year in response to an invitation to "marry." At that time, her parents did not seem to completely oppose the marriage, but only advocated "conditional retention." These two points are not very important, and there is no solid evidence after the fact, but the two characters, Fan Weishi and his wife Zhang Tianzhen, were inserted in between. Fan was the then head of the Preparatory Division of the Zhen'an Youth League. He wrote a letter entrusting his wife to deliver it to Wang Huimin, saying that a position as female youth leader was left vacant, and asking Wang to come to Zhen'an. The letter said: "County Magistrate Sun is my classmate, and our relationship is very harmonious. I am like a second master, and there is nothing I cannot do." "Zhen'an will become our paradise."</p>
<p>Wang indeed went to Zhen'an with Sun, and bought wedding supplies in Xi'an before leaving, but she happened to forget to buy a marriage certificate! Upon arrival, "This woman slept with the County Magistrate on the first day, and the guards said that the County Magistrate had brought his wife" (partner testimony). A "wedding ceremony" was held the next day, which the judge later considered an illegal wedding. Pitifully, this County Magistrate's "wife" was "not free to go out" from then on; "There were guards at the bedroom door"; Letters sent to the "wife" 'must first be given to the guards, and clerks were not allowed to enter.' After two months of dragging on like this, this "First-Class Madam" (the satirical term used by Sun's defense lawyer) finally committed suicide by swallowing poison! Did she take it herself? Or was she forced to take it? There is currently no evidence. The judge ruled definitively: 'Her poisoning was indeed caused by rape, and therefore she committed suicide out of shame and anger, which is highly certain.' Even more pitiful is that the daughter died in Zhen'an, and the father, still in the dark, wrote a letter asking her to return to Xi'an for the wedding ceremony!</p>
<p>Another small matter can also show Sun's character: The day before the bloodshed, a Zhen'an telegraph bureau staff member sent a telegram from Xi'an to Chairman Li that seemed to contain innuendo, and Sun shackled the messenger and detained him for more than ten days. This is the third charge that the prosecutor charged Sun with in addition to murder and rape leading to death: unlawful detention, depriving people of freedom.</p>
<p>Sun Junbo Declared, "I Will Commit Suicide if Sentenced to Death," Did Not Fast After Hearing the Sentence But Wanted to Live</p>
<p>After one interrogation hearing and three debate hearings, the Xi'an District Court announced on the 7th of this month: "Sun Junbo abused his official authority and jointly committed murder, sentenced to death, deprived of political rights for life. Abused his official authority, raped, causing the victim to commit suicide out of shame and anger (referring to Wang Huimin's death), sentenced to 12 years of fixed-term imprisonment, deprived of political rights for 10 years. Abused his official authority to unlawfully detain and deprive others of freedom of movement (referring to the detention of the telecommunications bureau staff member), sentenced to 1 year of fixed-term imprisonment, shall be executed with the death penalty, deprived of political rights for life. Yang Xutang and Yang Baojun (both Sun's guards) jointly committed murder, sentenced to death, deprived of political rights for life. Ma Zhuoran (Provincial Government Inspector), Luo Zhen, Zhang Zhizhong (these two were also Sun's guards) jointly committed murder, each sentenced to 10 years of fixed-term imprisonment, deprived of political rights for 10 years. Fan Weishi (Head of the Preparatory Division of the Zhen'an Youth League) jointly intended to abduct a woman for adultery, sentenced to 3 years of fixed-term imprisonment, deprived of political rights for 3 years. Zhang Tianzhen (Fan's wife) and Han Shijun are innocent. One Browning pistol and 15 bullets confiscated."</p>
<p>When questioned in court, Sun declared, "If I am found guilty, I will commit suicide in court." His attitude was stubborn, and he actually scared all of the plaintiff's defense lawyers into walking out of the courtroom. That day, he did not appear in court for the verdict. He complained to reporters in prison, and also said that he would fast to apologize to the people. But in fact, he did not completely fast, but his appetite was severely reduced in a state of hysteria. He is preparing to appeal in order to seek "life"!</p>
<p>No matter what kind of person Wang Huimin's father is, the reporter believes that his words are quite objective: "How the Zhen'an bloodshed is sentenced is no longer my personal problem of whether I can avenge my daughter. It is truly a touchstone between the spirit of the rule of law and bureaucratic politics."</p>

<h3>New Review of the United Nations' Two-Year Work</h3>
<p>July 8th, Shanghai United Translation</p>
<p>The world is changing rapidly, with new developments in certain locations appearing almost daily as newspaper headlines. This has been especially true in the two years since the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco on June 26, 1945, and Japan was about to surrender. Before modern history adds new records, we will review the significant developments of the past two years. This review must proceed according to the organization and growth of the United Nations, as the United Nations is the international body responsible for addressing the most pressing issues of our time.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Never before in history has there been an international organization as vast in scale and scope as the United Nations. The massive structure outlined in the Charter has now taken shape and is functioning. The sheer volume of international discussions that have taken place is unprecedented. In New York alone, over two thousand meetings have been held in the past year. This fact in itself may be the primary achievement of the United Nations—enabling politicians from various countries to discuss their problems face-to-face, with the world as their audience.</p>
<p>However, it is only natural for the world to demand more concrete results. Two years is a short period, merely a blink of an eye in history. But the world's needs are extremely urgent, as humanity is at a critical juncture in its destiny, and the major decisions affecting human fate cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>The establishment of the United Nations aims to achieve multiple goals. To use a common saying, the mission of this collective organization of sovereign states is to save humanity and make life worthwhile. As stipulated in Article 1 of the Charter, these goals are: to maintain international peace and security; to develop friendly relations among nations; to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character; and to be a center for coordinating the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends.</p>
<p>In less than two years, what work has the United Nations actually done to achieve these goals? It is impossible to review every task that has already begun or will soon be initiated. However, the following will demonstrate the organization's major responsibilities and the results achieved to date.</p>
<p>Security Council Handling Of</p>
<p>The First Major Event</p>
<p>Was the Iranian issue. The Iranian government complained to the Security Council, accusing the Soviet Union of interfering in its internal affairs and violating the 1942 Treaty of Alliance by stationing troops in Iranian territory, stating that this situation could lead to international friction. The Security Council raised this issue on January 19, 1946, and discussed it in London and New York. It was not until Iran reported that Soviet troops had withdrawn that the Security Council ceased discussion of the matter on May 22, 1946, but it still "retains this issue."</p>
<p>A few days later, the Security Council began its work when the Soviet Union brought the situation in Greece to the attention of the Security Council, stating that the continued presence of British troops in Greece implied interference in that country's internal affairs. After two Security Council meetings and statements from both parties, the Security Council considered the matter closed.</p>
<p>In August 1946, the Greek situation became a problem again when Ukraine complained to the Security Council that the policies of the Greek government threatened peace. The Security Council held twelve meetings to continue discussing the complaint, but all four resolutions proposed were rejected on September 20, and the issue was removed from the Security Council's agenda.</p>
<p>In December 1946, the Greek issue was raised again in the Security Council, this time by the Greek government, accusing Greece's neighbors—Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia—of aiding guerrillas in northern Greece in fierce fighting, thereby endangering public order and Greek territorial sovereignty. After lengthy discussions, with several heated debates, the Security Council unanimously resolved on December 19 to establish a Balkan Investigation Committee to determine the facts of the alleged violations along the borders of Greece and the other three countries.

<h3>Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Translation Questions</p>
<p>(1) Inheritance Without Descendants</p>
<p>He Zhongyi asks: My mother has two aunts, the elder married a Xue, and the younger married a Zhou. The younger aunt had no children. The uncle died in 1944. At that time, because there were no direct blood relatives, lineal nephews, brothers, or parents, the entire funeral was handled by the younger aunt, and her assets were also managed by the younger aunt. Now, because the aunt is getting older and her spirit is declining, and she has no one to accompany her, she intends to adopt her elder sister's daughter, Xiuying, as her adopted daughter. Please advise: (1) Can the younger aunt legally inherit her husband's estate after his death? (2) If she can inherit this estate, does it become the younger aunt's private property? (3) Can the younger aunt legally designate an heir? (4) If she can designate, are there gender restrictions on the designated person? (5) If there is no gender restriction, can a married woman be designated? (6) If so, what procedures are required legally? Is it necessary to file with the local court? (7) Are these designated actions subject to the Zhou family's restrictions?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Bingfan's reply] (1) The spouse can inherit the husband's estate. (2) Property inherited is naturally the private property of the individual. (3) You can designate an heir. (4) There is no gender restriction on designating an heir. (5) A married woman can be designated as an heir. (6) There are no specific legal procedures, and there is no basis for applying to the court for recordation. (7) The act of designating an heir is not subject to others' restrictions.</p>
<p>(2) Property Dispute</p>
<p>Jian asks: Mr. Jia is over seventy years old. His first wife bore him one son and two daughters. The two daughters died after marriage and both had children. The eldest son died the year after he got married. He has a posthumous daughter who is now an adult. Mr. Jia's second wife is still alive and has a son who is also married and has children. Now, due to family discord, the eldest daughter-in-law, Yi, wants to divide the family property, but Jia does not agree. Jia has jewelry worth over a thousand yuan, deposited in two firms under the name of the eldest daughter-in-law. There are two deposit books. In 1937, Jia withdrew the money to engage in commerce without Yi's knowledge, but the deposit books are still in Yi's possession. Please advise: (1) Can Yi demand an immediate division of property? (2) Can Yi use the deposit books to claim the deposit from the two firms?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Bingfan's reply] (1) Because Jia is still alive, inheritance has not yet begun, and a division cannot be claimed. (2) Yi can demand the money withdrawn from Jia, and cannot directly claim the debt from the bank.</p>

<h3>New Information on the Biography of Hudson</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>William Henry Hudson, the British biologist and writer, died in 1922. His childhood was spent on the South American plains, where he studied the region's animals and plants. In 1885, he wrote the two-volume novel "The Purple Land." In 1892, he wrote "The Naturalist at La Plata" (note: this area is in Argentina). His famous work is "Green Mansions: A Romance of the Tropical Forest" (note: this book is available in the Modern Library series), which discusses his knowledge of birds and animals and the magic of the Celts. In 1925, Prime Minister Baldwin built a bird sanctuary in Hyde Park in his memory, and Jacob Epstein sculpted a symbolic statue for him.</p>
<p>There are contradictions in Hudson's works. The biographical portion revealed in his works can be said to be both abundant and scarce. Each of his books contains autobiographical chapters, often plagued by homesickness, recalling the bird songs of years ago or the endless years on the South American plains. But these memories are timeless; they are unrelated to the calendar and can belong to any dawn or summer within a long period of time. Hudson is both rich and stingy; his memories are vivid and charming, which is richness; his events lack definite locations, which is stinginess.</p>
<p>Hudson rarely wrote the dates on his letters. His friends were also unable to know his year of birth. In his later years, he seemed to focus on the beauty of the land he loved, wanting to forget the passage of time. As a result, the events of his past became a secret. Morley Roberts, the friend who wrote his biography, could only guess the year he went from his birthplace to England, and still guessed wrong by four years. There are many missing years and blanks in Hudson's biography.</p>
<p>Hudson's adolescence to adulthood was around 1860, when he lived in Argentina. He went from South America to England in 1880, during which time he had been to Patagonia. If we are willing to take the trouble, we can find an exact date in the annual report of the Smithsonian Institution: in 1866, Hudson collected specimens in Buenos Aires. Three years later, Hudson paid for bird skins, but there are no records after 1870.</p>
<p>After World War II, someone visited Dr. A. Wetmore, a clerk at the Smithsonian Institution, who mentioned finding eight letters in the archives, six of which were written by Hudson. These letters had been hidden for eighty years and have only now come to light.</p>
<p>Two days after Christmas in 1865, Hinton Rowan Helper, the American Consul in Buenos Aires, wrote a letter to Dr. S.F. Baird of the Smithsonian Institution, introducing the young Hudson to him as the Assistant Secretary of the Institution. At that time, he was twenty-five years old, from which we know that Hudson was born in 1841 and lived to be eighty-three years old. Helper was also a famous figure at the time. His anti-slavery "The Impending Crisis," published in 1857, sold widely. His letter said, "Hudson is an aesthetically minded ornithologist who wishes to be employed to collect birds. He says himself that he can satisfy anyone who employs him, and I believe him. He says that he has collected for his own amusement but has not yet served the public. He wishes to serve your institution or any museum, American or otherwise. I would like to act as a faithful intermediary for both parties."</p>
<p>Baird's reply stated that he "would like to see the birds collected by Hudson and help him arrange them." He pointed out which small birds would be of the greatest scientific interest, and the letter was dated February 2, 1866.</p>
<p>More than a year later, Hudson's reply reached Baird, on February 12, 1867. The letter was written on September 5 of the previous year, in Conchhas, about twelve miles from Buenos Aires, where he grew up and lived at the age of sixteen. From the newly discovered letters, we know that Hudson lived there around the age of sixteen.</p>
<p>Of Hudson's six letters, the first is the longest and most interesting, saying, "Mr. Helper showed me the letter you gave him, asking me to collect birds. I had hoped to have two or three hundred types before September, but I was disappointed; I wanted to collect winter birds, which are rare in this season. I traveled many miles and did not find a single specimen. The birds I sent are still those I collected before, mostly known to biologists. It is too early to collect summer birds, and I don't think I will collect anything in two or three weeks, so I have to present what little I have. I don't believe these things will reach you completely undamaged because I don't have the experience for this kind of work; but even if there is a loss, it may not be too much. I hope to send you more specimens when your next letter arrives. I want to try to get ostrich eggs and a box of snail shells, of which I believe there are only four types in this city. Because you did not mention writing bird names, I only marked the male and female of each type on the edge of the wrapping paper; but if you need it, I can make a description of each type in the future, adding its habits. These birds were all shot by me with a gun within eight miles of the city of Buenos Aires. You say that small birds are best for scientific use. If I search carefully, I can find a lot of small birds in the Ze Lin Nong along the river, some of which I am afraid have never been known before. You must know the geographical state of Buenos Aires, which is a wide, almost treeless plain, where birds and animals have no shelter from the cold winter winds or the scorching summer winds. So this place is not suitable for collecting, purely for the sake of loving nature, I hope to change to another place. I will use all my time to pursue this work. In addition to birds, I am also willing to collect fossils, insects, grasses, etc."</p>
<p>Hudson said that there are only four types of snails in Argentina, but there are nearly four hundred types. His second letter was dated June 1867, mentioning that there was a "blackbird" in the paper box, sent with the bird skin. He hoped that Baird would examine it carefully; he was convinced that this was a previously undiscovered new specimen. Nine months passed. In his fourth letter (the location is still Conchhas, the date is March 15, 1868), we heard Hudson's disappointed cry. Baird's reply did not mention his blackbird at all. Hudson mentioned that Dr. Burmeister, curator of the Buenos Aires Natural History Museum, "would like to know what name you would give this blackbird." It is probably that Hudson hoped to put his own name on it.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years later, Hudson began to write his "Idle Days in Patagonia," recalling his South American bird-hunting dream: "I hope to find new specimens, such as a beautiful bird, such as a wryneck, a meadowlark, etc., but this bird must never have been seen by human eyes, nor has it been named. I don't know if other ornithologists have such great feelings; as for myself, I even dream of a new bird at night, actively seen by me; such a dream is beautiful to me, and I often feel sad when I wake up. This bird in the dream is often gray, brown or other stable colors."</p>
<p>In this paragraph, we hear the accelerated sound of the poet's feelings. Then, the disappointment in the letter can be imagined. Now we know that this blackbird is the Argentine cowbird, scientifically called Molothrus rufoaxillaris, which was discovered by an American scientist who discovered the bird only a few months earlier than Hudson, preventing Hudson from realizing his dream early. It was not until a few years later, in Patagonia, that he collected a surprising bird, which was named after him, called Cnipolegns hudsoni.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian Institution still retains many of the birds that Hudson collected around 1866, and people can tell at a glance which ones were collected by Hudson. Because everyone else's legs are facing backwards, he puts his legs forward.</p>
<p>Hudson mentioned in his fourth letter that he enclosed a photo, which has also never been published.</p>
<p>Leaving Conchhas was Hudson's highest wish, which can be known from the four letters he gave to the Smithsonian Institution. In June 1867, he said: "If I stay at home, I will not be able to collect completely." In March of the following year, he reported: "Maybe I will leave Conchhas." On June 3, 1868, he had already decided in his heart. In his last letter, he said, "Now I am troubled by miscellaneous affairs and cannot concentrate on collecting. But I still have the wish that soon I can use all my time to pursue the scholarship I love. Naturally, I am going to leave Conchhas, because there are no new specimens to be found here anymore."</p>
<p>Apart from Patagonia, we don't know where Hudson traveled. After 1868, the curtain fell again. But in the two-year period from December 1865 to June 1868, due to the discovery of museum letters, this curtain rose again, and we know the period when Hudson collected bird specimens; his hopes, plans, and previously questioned parts are all known.</p>

<p>The young woman Fang Zhen died of lung disease in Fuxing Park. Although the incident is not enough to be a lesson, her calm arrangement before her death was quite charming, so I pity her with a poem. (See today's newspaper for details)</p>
<p>Do not be sad about burying your delicate body; you have seen through the world and are even more heartbroken. The most touching thing is the lingering perfume, which still makes the ghost fragrant all over.</p>
<p>The inscription on the tombstone is simple and thought-provoking. The little birds and delicate flowers are silent. Where have the violent storms gone? How pitiful that such a beautiful figure has fallen!</p>
<h3>Foot Kiss</h3>
<p>— Sikong Wuji</p>
<p>To ROZA</p>
<p>In every most inadvertent place.</p>
<p>I send out my distant thoughts;</p>
<p>On every strange smile,</p>
<p>I am trying to find the bud of my misty heart.</p>
<p>In the ant-like crowd of tourists,</p>
<p>I am particularly aware of loneliness,</p>
<p>When I am lonely, I only close my singing mouth.</p>
<p>The water of Taihu Lake is as misty and vast as</p>
<p>My elusive thoughts.</p>
<p>The willow branches on the shore are like your soft hair</p>
<p>Floating across my face;</p>
<p>And fluttering through my trembling soul.</p>
<p>How much poetry is hidden at the intersection of water and sky!</p>
<p>Turning my head, I am left behind the line of sight</p>
<p>I gently, gently explore the road ahead;</p>
<p>I am surprised that my thoughts shattered the leaves.</p>
<p>With how many dreamy footprints</p>
<p>I stealthily kiss your fragrant trail.</p>
<p>Sikong Wuji</p>
<h3>Maple Bridge</h3>
<p>— Yang Daming</p>
<p>Familiar bridge</p>
<p>Familiar maple leaves</p>
<p>Everything remains the same</p>
<p>Old dreams are like rainbows</p>
<p>Lonely shadows</p>
<p>Lonely memories</p>
<p>Twelve years of war and displacement</p>
<p>The songs of the past have been buried</p>
<p>A falling pebble</p>
<p>Stirs up ripples</p>
<p>Are they the wrinkles of longing</p>
<p>Or the tear marks in my heart</p>
<p>A tear of longing</p>
<p>A pearl of the night</p>
<p>I am willing to sprinkle ten thousand pearls as a gift</p>
<p>To illuminate the smile of your childhood</p>
<h3>Owl</h3>
<p>— Luo Yingfeng</p>
<p>Resting in the deep forest</p>
<p>Hesitating on the tall branches</p>
<p>The sun does not know your dwelling</p>
<p>Like an ancient recluse philosopher quietly thinking</p>
<p>Despising the brilliance of spring</p>
<p>Despising the chirping of the morning</p>
<p>When the autumn wind howls in the night</p>
<p>Use sad songs to make the village tremble</p>
<h3>Smoke</h3>
<p>— Mai Jun</p>
<p>A piece of blue sea,</p>
<p>Rippling with the boat of thought;</p>
<p>This strange and mysterious voyage,</p>
<p>The small boat often rises in the blue!</p>
<p>Some say it is a source of inspiration,</p>
<p>Creating many beautiful poems;</p>
<p>Some say it is a symbol of life,</p>
<p>The magnificent waves suddenly wither.</p>
<p>But I believe in one sentence,</p>
<p>It is the true incarnation of Venus;</p>
<p>This light jade body and graceful dance.</p>
<p>Is comforting my lonely heart!</p>
<h3>Bed</h3>
<p>— Wang Deyun</p>
<p>Life gives you fatigue, bed gives you rest; life gives you suffering, bed gives you comfort; life gives you the ugliness of reality, but bed gives you the beauty of dreams.</p>
<p>"Introspection in the Deep Night" happens at the dead of night when you are lying in bed; the joy of reading a book under a blanket on a snowy night also happens when you are in bed; "Listening to the wind and rain all night in a small building" even depicts the elegance of a poet on a couch; "Bright moonlight before my bed" evokes homesickness, making one feel deeply melancholic.</p>
<p>Bed: it is the window on a rainy day, the umbrella under the scorching sun, the nanny of life, the mother of the sick.</p>
<p>Far-reaching thoughts and truth are the places where the spirit rests; the bed is where the weary body rests; it gives you memories, introspection, wisdom, and even rebirth, joy, and comfort.</p>
<p>Therefore, a weary body certainly needs a bed; an unhealthy and distorted mind even more needs the nurturing and management of a mental bed.</p>
<p>Life cannot be separated from the bed. The relationship between the bed and life is too close. People spend almost half of their time entrusting themselves to the bed. Although dreams occur on the bed, the terrors of the human world are indeed even greater than dreams. Although ancient people once uttered the bold saying that a great man should be wrapped in horsehide and die on the battlefield rather than in bed, in fact, the "horsehide" and "battlefield" they referred to are also "beds," but more lofty and grand places of trust.</p>
<p>I believe that the truest emotions and truest faces of people are revealed when they are sound asleep in bed. Daytime is contrived and artificial (hence Lu Xun's "Ode to the Night at Night"), while night is exposed and genuine. A person's daily life is both tedious and treacherous. Only when you return home with a body and mind full of weariness and disappointment and lie on the bed can you no longer need to deploy your "worldly" skills, nor be meticulously cautious about anything anymore. You can freely relax your body and mind, and indulge wantonly and unreservedly. Although some people believe that people's sleeping postures are detestable, might the true face of Lushan still not be charming? The same goes for dreams. Who can believe that the grand and dignified conversations of the daytime are more real than the dream artistry of midnight?</p>
<p>Truly, those who have beds are blessed. Friend, when you leisurely light up a cigarette and lie quietly on a comfortable Simmons mattress, have you ever thought of the wanderers who brave the stars and moon and eat frost and dew?</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 347</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>The guest choked with emotion, lifting his wide sleeve to wipe away his tears. The handsome, robust energy of his youth in school, the British gentlemanly demeanor of his middle age, not a trace of these could be found on him at this moment. From the time he was robbed at Changxindian until today, it has been only about ten days in total. Changxindian, Beiping, Tianjin, the situation has turned upside down, becoming a grim and ghostly world. He, Engineer Wu Dingyuan, has also completely turned into a ghost.</p>
<p>Indeed, he had borrowed a pistol from "04" and, after leaving the hospital room at Xiehe Hospital, wrote us a letter saying that he was going to seek revenge, to kill Japanese devils. The last news we received was that he had rushed out of Xizhimen. At the same time, another piece of news said that the Japanese army was also fighting our army outside Xishimen at that time. Based on our deduction at the time, we believed that he must have sacrificed himself.</p>
<p>"Brother Dingyuan," I suppressed my emotions, "How did you get here?"</p>
<p>"That's a divine story—a living deity enlightened me!" In his sorrowful tone, a trace of humor remained.</p>
<p>After he sneaked out of the hospital, he heard the sound of artillery fire deafening the sky outside the west city. He knew that the Japanese invaders were flaunting their power there. Without further consideration, he got into a rickshaw and told the driver to run west. Near Xibianmen, the rickshaw could not pass. The garrison troops were gathering there, preparing to rush out of the city and, together with the reinforcements, fight a bloody path to break through the encirclement. Staying in the city would mean being captured.</p>
<p>He was the only civilian running with the army. His sick body could not keep up with the troops. Although he ran for a few miles, his strength gave out, and he fainted by the roadside. When he woke up, he only felt a pair of hands massaging his head. Gradually, he discovered that the place he was sleeping was not like a hospital, nor like an ordinary residence. There was a divine seat, an eternal lamp, a bell, and a . Although the light was dim and he could not see the four walls clearly, he guessed in his mind that this was a small temple. What was especially confirming was that he discovered that the person massaging him was an old Taoist priest.</p>
<p>He exchanged a few words with the old Taoist and learned that he had been unconscious for three or four hours. The old Taoist noticed that he was ill and asked people to carry him to the temple—Sanqing Temple—a small, poor Taoist temple. There was only one old Taoist and one old incense keeper in the temple. The old Taoist said that he knew a little about pulse diagnosis and had taken his pulse. He knew that he was out of balance after the illness and that he would be fine after a few days of rest.</p>
<p>Two days later, the old Taoist told him that the city and the outside of the city could temporarily be at peace. Beiping had been controlled by the Japanese. As long as he did not "resist," there would be no danger. He did not keep any secrets from the old Taoist, telling him his experience and the tragic deaths of his six or seven family members, and saying, "This sick body of mine is useless alive. I must risk this life to kill a few devils to avenge my wife and children."</p>
<p>The old Taoist, however, had another set of philosophical ideas: "This is a calamity; 'what is destined cannot be avoided.'... But 'it is better to live shabbily than to die well!'... As for revenge, if you take revenge with a sick body, it is better to wait until your body recovers... Moreover, Sanqing Lao Ye (Li Lao Jun) does not advocate revenge, but he also does not allow demons and monsters to run rampant. Therefore, there is Erlang Shen under the throne of Lao Ye, who is specially in charge of subduing demons and eliminating monsters. It is better to ask for a divination to see the opinion of Sanqing Lao Ye and Erlang Shen. It is more certain..."</p>

<h3>Stopping "School Shops" from Extorting Money</h3>
<p>— Shi Lang</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Municipal Bureau of Education published the list of primary schools with open finances in the newspaper. This is a declarative measure, worthy of emulation by all parties. However, this is only a passive act of recognition. In the active aspect, the education authorities should more strictly announce the list of schools with undisclosed finances, so that they may be more cautious. More importantly, the education authorities should send personnel to supervise and audit school funds in order to completely clarify the severely chaotic financial situation of Shanghai's schools.</p>
<p>Taking the example of primary school students in the Sixteenth District Central National School reporting the school authorities, they revealed the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The upper semester has not yet ended, yet the fees for the next semester must be paid; (2) If they are not paid, expulsion from school is threatened; (3) Various fees are collected from students in a manner close to extortion, soliciting various donations; (4) False items are set up, and various construction fees, book fees, etc., are forcibly extorted.</p>
<p>This kind of "school shop" atmosphere must be jointly investigated by the Bureau of Education, the Council, and local impartial people. Its steps should at least adopt the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Allow students of all ages to present evidence and facts to report and accuse;</p>
<p>(2) Allow parents to list the items and amounts of various unreasonable fees forcibly collected;</p>
<p>(3) Allow teachers and staff to list the school authorities' deductions of salaries and all the dark sides of school administration.</p>
<p>Merely a document from the Ministry of Education announcing the regulations for the payment of miscellaneous fees for primary and secondary schools in the next semester is not enough to wash away the various "irregularities" of public and private schools of all sizes, nor is it enough to wash away the general parents' fear of paying fees for their children's enrollment.</p>
<p>The education authorities should launch a school cleanup campaign without delay to bring all schools in Shanghai into a normal and reasonable state!</p>

<h3>How to Relieve Sorrow?</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ming Sen, written by American E. Dickert</p>
<p>Almost everyone is depressed at times.</p>
<p>The most necessary thing to relieve or reduce this periodic nameless melancholy is self-discipline; the second is understanding—understanding the truth.</p>
<p>First, you must sincerely decide that you really want to overcome this depressing mood. Second, you must understand that this depression is common rather than abnormal—almost everyone has it. Scientists have already discovered that happy and depressive emotions have a certain periodicity. Emotional highs and lows can be charted and the next "depression period" can be accurately predicted. Pathological depression and decline are also caused by the deterioration of this natural cycle.</p>
<p>Although depression and unhappiness are natural and periodic occurrences, you can try to relieve or reduce them. To eliminate this depression, all people can be divided into two major categories, and you must be able to fall into one of them: either you must face your depression head-on, find out its cause and take action to deal with it—or you must escape it, and use other activities to drive it out of your mind.</p>
<p>For people who find it difficult to admit their mistakes, "escape" is probably a worthwhile method. As for other people, if they escape reality, they will feel guilty.</p>
<p>To determine which type of person you belong to, try to answer the following questions: "Do you truly secretly admit your shortcomings? Are you able to make sincere self-criticism?" If you can do these things, then your most satisfactory way should be to face the cause of your depression and use action to eliminate it. If your answer is no, then you are probably better off trying to escape those occasional feelings of depression or resentment.</p>
<p>"Understanding the truth" is a necessary procedure to deal with depression. For example, if you carefully explore the reasons for your inner guilt, you may find that it is because you promised to take your wife and children to play, but did not do it. In such cases, you should take them out for a fun trip tonight or on the most recent holiday. By acknowledging your mistakes and correcting them, you can eliminate that guilt.</p>
<p>However, sometimes, the causes of your depression may be external circumstances that you have no way to change immediately other than to find them out—in that case, you can use a "substitute correction method." For example, if you are a woman and you feel disappointed and unhappy because you have not been invited to join a gardening club, what can you do? You can find a way to replace it: cook a particularly delicious dish for your family to prove that you are not incompetent. A better remedy is to start cultivating the best exotic flowers and plants in the area. Or discuss your problems with close friends. Never ask for sympathy. Only wise consultation will help you see that you are not the only one who has had such feelings.</p>
<p>The "low tide" of depression is not difficult to recognize when it strikes. If you are someone who has to escape, you should try to avoid thinking about the problem that is bothering you, and instead turn your mind to some activity that you love and are good at. Put your energy into doing it—whether it is a game, reading the newspaper, hard work, or sleeping.</p>
<p>A housewife I know has realized that "hard work on housework can drive away any of my worries." When the emotional low tide strikes, she works hard to clean the house, tidy up the rooms, and wash everything.</p>
<p>Another woman I know has exactly the opposite treatment. She said: "When I am in a bad mood, I want to leave home and change my environment! Go to the movies, look at the shop windows. I immerse myself in external things and forget my troubles."</p>
<p>I also know a man who uses sleep to get through his "depression period," just like a drunk after drinking.</p>
<p>What method you use to escape your depression seems to be irrelevant—as long as it can make you concentrate.</p>
<p>I also want to introduce something: a "depression diary." The next time you feel bad, start keeping this diary, and write in it every time thereafter. First record the date when your depressive emotions began, then record how you feel, what you determine its cause and reason to be, and how you plan to cure it.</p>
<p>This kind of diary will become a record. If you take it out and review it during a period of depression, it will remind you that you have been in such a bad mood before and eventually overcome it. It will also show you which treatments are effective and which are not. And writing out your depression will also help you forget it.</p>

<h3>MacArthur in Japan</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>From the Japanese perspective, Rick Worser has been recognized as a symbol of Japan's new democracy, a living God. They believe that all the rights they have today were bestowed by MacArthur alone. To express their gratitude, thousands of Japanese people write letters to MacArthur, thanking him for his food, protection, and democracy.</p>
<p>MacArthur rarely appears in Tokyo, not even often inspecting the troops. Therefore, not only is it not easy for the Japanese to see him, but neither are his subordinates. Outside the gate of the US military headquarters, there are often many American soldiers and Japanese people holding cameras trying to capture a shot of MacArthur, but military police and police make it difficult for them to get close.</p>
<p>MacArthur gets up at 7 am every day, eats at 8 am, and then spends most of his time reading books. At 11 am, he goes to the US military headquarters to work, where he regularly reviews important documents and those letters from Japanese people. Apart from his chief of staff visiting him every morning, and foreign resident delegations occasionally meeting him once, MacArthur is "lonely" in Tokyo. In the past two years, Hirohito has only met with him two or three times.</p>
<p>MacArthur's recent policies for governing Japan, such as opening up Japan's private foreign trade, allowing Japanese fishing boats to sail to Antarctica for whaling, entrusting Japan with responsibility for mining on Palau Island, and restoring Japan's industrial equipment, have made the Japanese even more respectful of him.</p>
<h3>Lonely Journalism</h3>
<p>— Hei Zi</p>
<p>I often dream that we have such a newspaper that can truly be national, that can allow every Chinese person to see it when they get up. But this dream is ultimately just a dream. Newspapers with 100,000 to 200,000 copies have already become the largest newspapers in our country, how far away are they from sales of several hundred million to several million copies? Therefore, I still doubt that there is a sufficiently large newspaper in our country that can be said to be truly national. It is already very good to be able to have a newspaper seen in major cities across the north and south of the country. Therefore, I admire the British "News of the World," whose circulation of 7.5 million copies accounts for one-sixth of the total population of the British Isles. That is to say, on average, one in six British people buys a copy of "News of the World." This is a very large circulation, probably already approaching the saturation point of one newspaper per household.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a newspaper can be distributed to one household on average, which can be used as the highest circulation ideal for current social magazines. To achieve this goal, of course, requires huge capital, numerous talents, and a sound and rapid distribution system. More importantly, it requires a serious attitude and fair commentary. In this regard, the success of "News of the World" is attributed to its editorial policy, as pointed out by the New York Times in the United States.</p>
<p>We all know that a correct editorial policy must be to praise the good and criticize the bad, but in a society that does not respect public opinion, it is often regarded as personal preferences. Therefore, destroying newspapers will also become a "fashionable trend." Originally, society's support for the newspaper industry was not strong enough, but it was given spiritual blows and material destruction, which naturally made our country's concentration more symbolic.</p>
<p>In the past, incidents of destroying newspapers have emerged one after another in various places. The "Fuxing Evening News" in Kunming was destroyed by morning school students, and the "New Life Daily" in Anqing was robbed and destroyed by thugs. Now, the "Da Bao" in Ningbo has been ordered to suspend publication for three days by the Zhejiang Military Administration District and the county government because of its comments on the conscription system. Not long ago, a newspaper was destroyed, and its host even came to Shanghai to appeal, which also illustrates how fragile the objective foundation for the long-term development of our country's newspaper industry is.</p>
<p>Scientific Essays</p>
<h3>The Emergence of Butterflies</h3>
<p>— Jia Zuzhang</p>
<p>In the ancients, who claimed to "investigate things to attain knowledge" but actually "did not know without investigating," the metamorphic process of larvae becoming pupae and then pupae emerging as butterflies was felt to be confusing and unable to be grasped concretely. The earliest record is in Zhuangzi's "Supreme Happiness" chapter, which says: "The root of a bird's foot is a grub, and its leaf is a butterfly." The "Heavenly Omens" chapter also says: "Butterflies are Xu, transforming into insects, born from rotting leaves, their shape like a shed skin, their name is Qu Duo." This is a record of generative transformation and cannot be considered to have understood the metamorphosis of butterflies. Later, the "Records of Searching for the Supernatural" said: "When wheat becomes butterflies, wings are born, eyes are formed, the mind is present, this is from unknowing transformed into knowing, and the qi is changed." "Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang" says: "Scholar Gu Feixiong saw a broken green skirt in a tree dwelling when he was young, which then turned into a butterfly. Zhang Zhoufeng, an official in the Ministry of Works, said that if lilies are closed and their calyxes are covered with mud, they will transform into large butterflies overnight." These are all just assumptions.</p>
<p>The most detailed and accurate record of actually seeing emergence is probably the explanation of cabbage white butterflies and swallowtail butterflies in Erya Yi: "Now the green worms in vegetables crawl on green walls or plants in spring, securing themselves with silk. One night, looking at them, they have corners. In six or seven days, their backs split, and they shed their skins to emerge as butterflies. The large butterflies scatter their eggs on citrus, which become green worms. After a long time, they transform into large butterflies." The "Zezhou Records" also says: "In the autumn of Chongzhen Gengchen, the trees on Xicheng Mountain were covered with worm shells, like human figures, three inches long, green, with clothes and sleeves complete, and black velvet threads through the armpits, like puppet ropes. Monks in the mountains took them to hang in their rooms. In spring, the green shells split, and a butterfly flew out, which was very interesting." This describes the shape of the pupae in great detail, but unfortunately, it does not explain the shape of the butterfly, so it is impossible to trace back to what kind of species it is.</p>
<p>The "Records of the Northern Household" has a record of charming butterflies. Although it is not known what kind of butterfly is referred to, it has valuable practical observations of the metamorphic process: "Lingbiao has crane grass, a vine flower. It blooms in summer, its shape like a flying crane, its wings and spurs are all complete. It is said to be a charming grass. Picking and drying it is used instead of facial rouge. A pair of worms grow on the vine, eating the leaves. They are collected into powder boxes and fed with leaves. When they are old, they shed their skins and become butterflies, red and yellow in color. Women collect and wear them, like delicate bird skins, making people charming and happy, and they are called charming butterflies."</p>
<p>After listing the explanations of various butterfly transformations, the "Compendium of Materia Medica" added a conclusion: "These are all based on what they have seen. They do not know that all insects shed their skins when they are old and transform into butterflies and moths, just as silkworms must emerge. Rotten clothes and objects also produce insects and transform." This is a very reasonable explanation. But then it says: "The transformation of plants, flowers, and leaves is caused by qi and wind. Their color also depends on the color of the flowers and leaves eaten by the insects and the color of the things they transform into." That falls into the mist of generative transformation again.</p>
<p>When silk moths first emerge, their wings are wrinkled, and their bodies are weak. They must rest for a considerable amount of time before they can spread their wings and fly. Yang Wanli has a poem about observing the transformation of things, which describes the state of an emerging butterfly very vividly: "The newly born butterfly has not learned to fly, its curly hair and wet powder sleep on the flowering branch. Later, borrowing the power of the wind and light, it does not remember the time of being foolish and drunk."</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu</p>
<p>Hotels have become a necessity in American life because many small families do not cook for themselves, but eat out. American young couples rarely have the patience to cook, either burning the noodles or stewing the chicken soup dry. Moreover, cooking for themselves, buying vegetables becomes a major event. In inland China, vegetable vendors bring vegetables to the door. In the United States, they must go to the grocery store to buy them. Americans do not have the habit of using baskets, so they clamp large loaves of bread under their arms and hold chickens, fish, milk, eggs, grapes, and cabbage in their hands. Of course, those with cars do not need to carry them themselves, but when the housewife goes shopping, the car has already been taken by her husband to the office. If it is a small family of two people, it is better not to cook for themselves. Restaurants are concentrated in the downtown area, and coffee shops are almost on every street. Coffee shops have food, but sandwiches can also fill the stomach.</p>
<p>Restaurants are divided into several types. There are noble hotels attached to large hotels, where there is a band accompanying the Qin during meals, and the minimum is three and a half yuan per person in guided places. Ordinary restaurants without bands are about two yuan per person. Larger coffee shops also provide food. The most economical and generous is the self-service cafeteria. The scale is extremely magnificent, enough to accommodate more than a hundred people for dining. After entering the door, line up in a row, taking plastic plates or lead plates, knives, forks, and glass cups. When walking to the food distribution counter, take any dishes you want, such as braised beef, noodles, chicken soup, cold dishes, ice cream, coffee, pastries, etc. When passing by the accounting lady, she writes the price of the food on a piece of paper and hands it to you. Then find a place to sit down, and pay the money to a lady who collects money after you finish eating. Generally, it costs about one yuan per meal. There is no tip here. If you go to other restaurants, not only are the dishes more expensive, but you also have to give a tip of 10% to 20%.</p>
<p>We Chinese people give tips of one or two yuan in order to win face for the country. If ten people are dining together, giving ten or twenty yuan in tips is already very generous. The YMCA canteen is a more economical place, but there is only one YMCA in each city, while self-service restaurants are everywhere. The cold drink counters in drugstores also provide sandwiches and long, round breads with sausages. Americans call that liver-colored artificial sausage "hot dog." American women like to eat that kind of thing the most, but if you ask her if she wants to eat sausage, she will blush and feel embarrassed. That thing is neither delicious nor elegant. (Twenty)</p>
<h3>Is This Tolerable, What Is Intolerable?</h3>
<p>— Xiang Jun</p>
<p>"On June 25, 1947, the British government held a boxing match in Plymouth. They invited diplomatic envoys and military personnel stationed in Britain from various countries to attend. The grand occasion, with over 200,000 people, was rarely seen after the war. Our 600 naval personnel stationed in Britain also arrived on time and were placed at the forefront alongside military personnel from other countries. As the flags fluttered in the breeze, the flags of Britain, America, the Soviet Union, France... and other countries stood proudly side by side, but the Chinese flag was conspicuously absent. Just as we were about to question this, the British side suddenly requested that we move to the back. Only afterward did we learn that they had moved British female soldiers to the front row. At this moment, the audience's emotions were already high and clamorous, following the tension of the boxers. Suddenly, from the ranks, we heard Mr. X's sorrowful and indignant cry: 'Look, look—our national flag!...' Under the gaze of thousands, we saw a huge 'Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth' national flag being spread flat on the boxing ring—trampled under the feet of the boxers. The 600 Chinese naval personnel, witnessing this insult to their motherland, were all filled with grief and indignation, and tears streamed down their faces. They immediately questioned the organizers, whose reply was, 'I don't know.' So, they indignantly returned to their camp together—(i.e., the Renown cruiser). They telegraphed our ambassador to Britain, requesting a strong and effective protest, but there has been no response to date. All believe that this incident was not accidental. If a reasonable and satisfactory public response is not received, they are willing to return to China immediately as a whole, and will request the people of the nation to unanimously refuse to accept the 'gift' from the 'Great' British Empire of outdated and dilapidated warships. ... "Excerpt from a friend's letter.</p>
<p>Regarding the above news, our government should immediately issue a serious protest.</p>
