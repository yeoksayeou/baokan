<h3>平抑漲風緊急措置　連日會商大體擬定　整個方案已呈主席核示</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕政府現正分兩方面努力，務使目前之金鈔狂漲物價高揚親象，得以平息。關於黃金美鈔價格平抑事，正由宋子文·貝祖飴全力處置中。平定物價辦法，則由經部會同社會·糧食·交通各委會與京滬市政及經濟當局擬議中。整個緊急措置方案，經各有關長官三日日來於蔣主席指示下數度會商後，大體已擬就，十三日晚將先呈請主席核示。蔣主席官邸，十三日晚會議至十一時始散。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕經部十三日午曾犁行重要會談，王雲五主持，出席潘序倫·蕭録·谷正倫·龐松舟·凌鴻勛·吳兆洪·潘公展·沈怡·黃伯度等。席間曾就平定物價事交換意見，並有所決定·至下午三時許始散。聞平定物價，將自兩方面同時進行，其一為配發公務員實物，另一則為工資問題，經部手頭所有之棉紗·燃料·及糧部所有之米糧，皆將分發於公務員，至配給機構，社會部主張利用現有之合作社，交通部將在運輸方面協助進行。又聞此事將先於京滬沿綫試辦。關於工資問題，亦籌謀予以穩定。王雲五等會舉後，四時又運袂赴宋子文處續商，七時赴主席官邸請示。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕關於公教人員日用必需品之供應事，經濟部定十四日召集有關機關代表開會商討，屆時對公教人員日用品之配給是否舉辦，及其具體辦法如何，均將有所決定·經濟部管制司長龍大鈞，於日前赴滬邀請有關機關派代表來京會商，籠氏已於今日下午偕中紡公司燃料管理委會上海物資供應局等代表吳味經等抵京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕滬市長吳國楨十四日晨可抵京，將參加經部所舉行之重要會議。中紡代表吳味經，燃管會代表徐善揚，已先期來京。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕擬組織中之經濟政策研究委會，初步名單有宋子文·俞鴻鈞·陳果夫·徐堪·陳立夫·潘公展·蕭錚·樓桐蓀·黃元彬等十五人，俟主席核示後即組成。人數的八九人，並將有一部份工商界名宿參加。</p>

<h3>中國經濟混亂情勢美國決不能坐視　紐約時報評我金融近況</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十三日廣播；紐約時報撰論稱：中國幣值慘跌後回漲，晴示該國之經濟崩潰或不至如一般人最近所想像之迅速。此種回漲或僅為暫時的，但除非中國人民對於該國政府力能控制危局之保證尙存若干信念，則此暫時的穩定恐亦不能保持。吾人苟認為此事僅為一中國問題，則誠為絕大錯誤。須知此事亦為一美國問題，且係一嚴重問題，蓋美國為中國之樂友，吾人不能坐視其陷於不可收拾之局面也紐約世界電訊報評論</p>
<h3>美中止對華貸款　促成中國之危機</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十三日廣播：紐約世界電訊報評論中國經濟危機，據稱：此種局勢，乃因美國中止貸款中國所造成。該報並抨擎范宣德之不信任中國政策。</p>
<h3>美對華貿易停頓　進出口商受打擊</h3>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山十三日電〕美國進出口商協會執行秘書賴特克列夫今日聲稱：中國法幣波動，己使美國對華貿易陷於停頓，進出口商所受打擊最重，美國各商行現紛紛取消定貨，以待情况安定，除非堅決規定法幣價值，吾則預料一星期內將有反響，此於駛往東方之船隻减少，可以見之。「吾人唯有希望中國政府承認美元在中國有三種不同價值。」中國政府之外匯購賣規則，限制購買進出品至多價值二千美元，以及上週實施百分之五十進口附加稅，得款補助出口品，亦係限制貿易之因素。</p>
<h3>美不致征附加稅　抵制中國進口稅</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕關於南京政府貼補中國出口商問題，美國方面不致對於中國貨物徵收附加進口稅以為抵制。據財政部發言人今日稱：美國一九三〇年關稅法曾規定，財政部長如確認外國貨物有受其政府津貼情事，則此項貨物轍入美國時，應照數徽收附加稅。此事決定權操於財政部長之手，南京政府貼補出口辦法，如認為　在美國關稅法規模之內，則對於中國此種貨物即可不致徽收懲罰性之進口附加稅。已經發生同樣情事時，須經過澈底研究始能有所決定，對於中國今次之事亦然。美國官員希望中國當局能自行維持法幣價值，美國方面不致出以何種臂助。美國目下不致為中國某種特殊計劃而放款，進出口銀行對於中國部份之賬冊，已暫行封存矣。</p>
<h3>物價飛漲因素</h3>
<p>立院九人會擬成報告</p>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕金鈔物價問題，將為十四日立院大會主要議題之一，該院九人委會，將於會中提出一重要報告，說明物價飛漲種種因素，茲探誌該報告書所舉目前最巖重之七大問題如次：（一）政府僅着眼於一二管理較易獲利較豐之工商，而國營事業又動輙漲價，往往為民營事業漲價先導，日用所需狂躍允甚，一切物價均逾萬倍，似無止境。　紙幣發行日增，生產貸款亦辦理未盡完善，當局以為拋售黃金管制外滙，可以低抑物價，於是發行紙幣不能與生產相配合，紙幣愈發愈多，黃金愈拋愈高，所謂抑低物價，適得其反。况我國非產金國家，而現時國外貿易幾等於零，原存外滙，亦非無限，投機者窺得破綻，興風作浪，政府不察以貸款助高長風，致有不可收抬之勢。（三）國營事業類多無補民生，其非法濫支為數驚人，中紡公司不合法，支出多至四百廿七億。（四）自政府徵取人民黃金儲券，及以法幣折付美金公債後，信用掃地，益以通貨减值，已近萬分之一，支付債款依然一元以一元計值，致公債不能發行，挹注全恃紙幣。（五）貼補政策徒增國庫支出，刺激物價。（六）公教軍警人員，常在飢寒交迫之中，而總稅務司月薪英金七百磅，相差霄壤。（七）疊床架屋，駢枝機關有增無减，因人設事，靡費公帑，無法估計。又前所重付審查之四國家銀行法，立法原則亦將於十四日會中討論。</p>

<h3>軍調部美方人員　兩個月內可撤峻　美軍顧問團將在平設分團說不確</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕美大使館發言人康納士今日語記者稱：外傳美軍顧問團擬在平設分團事不確，軍調部美方人員大部自二月中起，六十日內約可撤退完畢，美方人員撤退後，軍調部將留官兵廿五人，負責清理剩餘財產，料理房屋等事宜，彼等於此期間，行政上將隸屬於美軍顧問團，然此非美軍顧問團將在平設立分團之謂。該發言人並稱：美軍顧問團長魯克斯將軍赴平，或將與軍調部美方當局會商人員互調事。魯克斯將軍因工作需要，可能調用部分軍調部人員，惟此僅屬互調性質，美軍顧問團人員並不增加。現在美軍顧問團担任職務而逾三年海外服務期限者，部分人員裝將由軍調部人員代替之。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平十三日電〕軍調部三方人員，忙於撤退結束工作，政府方面致力於照顧共方及美方之撤退，並安插所有工作人員，現每日仍照常辦公。今日有客歲軍調部成立時由重慶等地調用之憲兵六十餘人，分乘軍調部美方班機三架返京，是為軍調部解體後首批返京人員。自東北行轅調用軍官廿人，北平行轅十人，均將分別調回原機關工作。軍調部政府調處處長陳瑚少將決留平，就任平警備司令部參謀長新職。政府方面副委員蔡文治將軍，俟共方及美方人員撤竣後，至三月中旬前後始克返京。</p>

<h3>我餘鹽輸出政策　根據產量以顧全國內需要為主　有餘額時乃輸出數量並不限定</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕最近實業界對於我國餘鹽應否輸日問題，表示疑慮。記者茲自關係方面探悉：自勝利以後，我全國產鹽區收復，估計每年可能產量共達一億六百餘萬擔之鉅，連同原有存鹽約四千八百餘萬擔，總計為一億五千四百餘萬擔，除供應本國運銷之外，最低尚餘六七千萬餘　，無法處置，乃不得不一面設法節產，將不合經濟生產之鹽場，逐漸裁廢，同時為過剩之鹽謀求出路，適東京盟軍總部要求以我國餘鹽輸日，交換物資，經審慎考慮後，決定接受，其理由有三：（一）以國內無用途之鹽輸出國外，既有餘鹽謀出路，且可換取國內需要之物資，充裕國用；（二）解除鹽民生計困難及失業痛苦，免致釀成社會嚴重問題；（三）避免鹽民大量走私，妨礙稅收。</p>
<p>去年（三十五年）輸出數量，總計為二八九，九三五，五噸，本年則係根據三十五年底之存鹽數連同本年新產鹽斤之可能過剩數量，擬定初步輸出計劃，全年為七十八萬五千噸。一月至六月之上半年度，預計輸出為三十七萬六千噸，如以我國過去輸出情形觀察，此項數字相差並不懸殊。</p>
<p>據　政當局表示：吾人固極希望各國化學工業有長足之發展，自行充量利用過剩之鹽，但目前工業方面，事實上不能按納此項餘鹽，乃不得不配量輸出，實非獲已之舉，目前所採輸出政策係以顧全本國為主，有餘時，再行輸出，數量並不限定。本年產收數量，並無預期之多，屆時自當視供需情况配量，改變輸出計劃，決不致因輸出誤及國內食需也</p>

<h3>丁逆默邨判决理由原文</h3>
<p>— 續完</p>
<p>投機取巧</p>
<p>關於被告所提有利事實，計分四項：（一）自首：被告供稱，曾於卅一年春託人向中央自首，以示悔過立功。查該被告早於民國廿八年十月二日經最高法院檢察署明令通緝有案，並非在犯罪發覺前自動投案而受審判，固顯與刑法第六十二條所規定自首條件未合，而亦與漢奸自首條例第一條所規定自首先決要件不合，該被告所稱自首一節，自無庸置議。（二）協助抗戰：被告供稱，自首後，設掩護電台，密報敵情，反清鄉，反參戰，離間敵汪，破壞李士羣及七十六號，傳播參戰空氣，破壞敵寇之搜括物資，組織正風社，吸收悔悟分子，運用策略，遊說敵軍撤退，報請更換密碼，撤銷浙江封銷綫，控制偽軍預作反應，營救中央地下工作人員，建議大赦，俾便釋放已決政治人犯，以及發展淪陷區黨務文化各節等等。查被告所呈有關各該項證據，其認為有調查之必要者，均經一一詳予審核如掩護電台，組織正風社，供給情報，營救地下工作人員等項，有中國國民黨中央執行委員會組織部卅五年十二月十日特字第八一號密函，同年同月九日蔣伯誠及四日吳開先之函件，以及前軍委會調查統計局送案卷宗，堪據以認定為真實，惟被告雖具微功，然其罪大惡極，權衡利害，不足以償其罪惡於萬一，且據前軍事委員會調查統計局移送書內所載，以該被告於卅二年八月，經該局奉准運用曾在丁逆私宅內設電台與我正式通報，但此事已為敵軍所知悉，故意不加破壞，欲藉此與我中央留所謂和平之橋樑，其非忠實之自首，已可認定（見該局卷宗第卅六頁），是被告利用協助抗戰之名，投機取巧，已昭然若揭，殊不足採供量刑之參攷。</p>
<p>小恩小惠</p>
<p>（三）為淪陷區人民力謀福利：被告供稱，曾以私人資格，創立社會事業協會，農村福利協會，入各地遍設福利事業，經費均被告私人籌措募捐，减輕人民痛苦，為國家保存元氣，所辦之事業，另有一覽表存案。查被告所辦之社會事業，多為偽社會部及社會福利部之職掌，被告歷任各該部部長偽職多年，縱所列舉之事業為真實，乃其偽職上應所盡之義務殊難認為其為有利於人民之行為，且審核表列所辦各項事業，亦不過小恩小惠，藉以籠絡人心，俾其供敵偽驅使，殊難據為减刑之理由。（四）協助受降，保全地方：被告供稱，於勝利後，奉令協助中央受降，代為聯絡敵軍總司令，又代第三戰區聯絡浙江偽軍之請降事宜復協助第三戰區接收敵軍軍械物資及防地，前會奉派任前軍事委員會浙江地區軍事專員，維持浙江治安，嗣後交出全部偽軍保安團隊，由中央接收，無一人一槍走散。查被告協助受降，保全地方，有陸軍總司令部卅五年十月卅日秘字第十一號公函，堪以證明屬實，惟查各該項行為，均係在勝利之後，不合於處理漢奸案件條例第三條「曾為協助抗戰及有利於人民之行為」之條件，不能為减刑之根據，縱其犯罪後之態度，微有建白，不過途窮日暮，不得不俯首就範，殊難採為酌科之標準。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>怎樣應付當前的經濟困難？</h3>
<p>這一次發生的遍及全國各大都市的金鈔狂漲風潮，雖已因政府當局採取嚴峻的措施而趨平息；但是中國經濟危機的病根，依然存在，隨時還有發生的可能；不僅使全國上下引為當前的隱憂；而且也使各友邦深為關切。如果再不設法挽狂瀾於未倒，那末今後的金融風潮，勢將層出不窮，而且還要愈演愈烈；現在我們在這次風潮平息之後，痛定思痛，更加覺得政府當局有從速重行確立新的經濟政策之必要。中常會於十二日開會時，各中常委也一致認為，當前的經濟政策有重加檢討的必要，因此便決定設立一個經濟政策研究會，由若干中委，工商界名宿曁經濟學權威組織之，專門負研究經濟政策之責。足證政府當局對於當前的經濟政策，也認為有改絃易轍的必要了。</p>
<p>我國內在的問題，愈演愈複雜，已不是某一個單純的問題了。紐約泰晤士報十二日撰文，評論我國時局稱，「中國金融危機，是中國政治的病根。」因此主張：從挽救金融危機着手，以謀得政治問題的解決。這種看法，在表面上似乎很合理，但按之實際，並不盡然，而且有倒因為果之　，造成中國金融危機的真正原因，不在通貨膨脹，也不在「政府民望日落」，而在共產黨問題的未能解決。中國本是百般皆落後的國家，經過八年的艱苦抗戰，人力物力的損失，就是用天文數字來計算，也不足以代表我國所受的損失的萬一：何况在抗戰勝利之後，未及休養生息，就遭到中共的破壞與摧毀。自抗戰勝利以來，兵連禍結，國內從未有一天的太平，復員還談不到，怎能講得上復興！所以中共的問題一天不解決，中國金融的危機就一天沒有消滅的可能。</p>
<p>中共對於這次金鈔狂漲的風潮，不但抱着幸災樂禍的心情，大有所謂「隔岸觀火，拍手稱快」之感：而且還洋洋得意，滿以為中共搗亂金融政策的大成功，快要達到他們日夜所期望的「總崩潰」的目標。本報對於這次金鈔狂漲風潮，早就指出金融風潮中的政治因素；觀於馬歇爾特使離華返美就任國務卿時所發表的聲明，馬帥曾在其聲明中率直指出中國共產黨的陰謀，乃在以戰爭促成國內經濟的崩潰，從而達到其奪取政權的目的；可知內亂一日不停止，中國經濟就一日沒有好轉的可能。記得上月下旬，上海工商文化教育界鉅子，鑒於國內經濟的困難情形，也曾發出一個和平的呼　，要求雙方立卽就地停戰，在他們的宣言中有着這樣的幾句沉痛的傷心語：「全國人民都快要活不下去了。由於戰爭，成千成萬的同胞，繼續轉乎溝　；由於戰爭，交通阻隔，通貨不斷膨脹，人民失業，工商破產。因此我們不能不沉痛地發出良心的呼聲，要求停止戰爭，要求恢復和平。」但是中共聽了人民的沉痛呼聲，不僅沒有發生絲毫同情心，反而洋洋得意，額手慶幸其搗亂政策的大成功，所以內亂不特不能停止，而且只有擴大，接着中共便在魯南蘇北加緊發動攻勢。益使人民欲哭無淚。</p>
<p>中國經濟在中共的盡量破壞之下，試想怎能走上復興的大道？但是我們相信中國民族是至大至剛的優秀民族，對於「人定勝天」，具有不可動搖的信念，環境愈困難，人民愈知道艱苦奮鬥，只要政府有良好的政策，有重大的決心，有系統的計劃，任何經濟上的困難，都能逐一加以克服的，所以我們在政府重行商討經濟政策的時候。願提出幾項意見，以供國人的參考。</p>
<p>第一，我們認為內亂是經濟困難唯一的病根，也就是造成金融風潮的主因。我們老百姓是國家的主人翁，不能將國家的命運以及自己本身的命運，聽任中共恣意播弄，而應該大家站起來，為民族為國家為個人，爭取和平；個人的力量雖屬有限，但是大家都參加了上海工商界所發起的和平運動之後，這一個和平運動，自會發生出力量來。不問中共如何專斷，對於人民的呼聲，置若罔聞，但是民意不可侮，中共終不能不有所顧忌吧！如果中共一意孤行，則所謂失道寡助，無異於自絕於人民，多行不義必自斃。所以在這次風潮之後，我們老百姓更應起來爭取和平，以謀自救之道。</p>
<p>第二，挽救經濟的困難，固須有良好的政策，但僅止於政策；也是不會奏效的。我們觀察今日中國政治的通病，厥在「無統計」和「無計劃」。卽以這次金鈔風潮而論，喪心病狂的投機份子，不顧人民的死活，但求個人的利益，拉抬金鈔的價格，固為這次發生風潮的主因；但是財政當局的毫無計劃，毫無統計，也是助長風潮的原因之一。因為在廢曆新年前後，發行鉅額關金，不啻給投機份子一個好機會，利用能貨膨脹的理由，就可在市場上興風作浪，這是人人所能預料理到的。但是財政當局事前既無準備，至風潮發生後，又束手無策，任其蔓延擴大，以致市場瘋狂，益發不可收拾。到後來再採取嚴峻措施，雖然也能把漲上去的金價鈔價壓下來，但是追踪而上漲的物價，却很難抑平了。我們假定財政當局，有正確的統計，洞悉上海市場的底細，憑國庫的實力，與拉抬金價的投機份子鬥法，不信這次金鈔風潮不能避免。前事不忘，後事之師，但願財政當局能接受這次教訓，一變過去的作風，事事有計劃，物物有統計。法國抑平物價的收效，英國配給制的成功，却是靠了主管當局約有統計，有計劃，有決心。</p>
<p>第三，據美國合衆社南京電，謂政府於三個月解決國內經濟困難的根據，完全建築在美國的剩餘物資和日本的賠償之上。我們固不信該社的電訊為正確，但在國內也有部份人，抱着這種倚賴的心理。我們認為這個倚賴心最為可怕，不得不指出，這決不是中國經濟的出路。理財之道，不外乎開源節流。在開源方面。首在增加生產，便利交通，繁榮工商業：至在節流方面，不但要政府節省政費的開支，而且還要人民的節衣縮食。目前困難局勢的造成，乃在國內的生產小而消費大，有以致之。</p>
<p>要而言之，當前的經濟政策，應有重加檢討的必要，同時，為了應付當前的經濟困難，政府當局辦理任何事情，尤應有計劃，有統計，有決心。至於全國人民，在此國內經濟困難最嚴重的時候，自應節衣縮食，同舟共濟，俾能安然渡過難關。</p>

<h3>消防員勿一概抹煞</h3>
<p>一月二十二夜武定路大火案，衆議紛紜，莫衷一是。有謂消防員勒索金條，大講斤頭，有謂消防員袖手旁觀，見火不救，有謂救火員趁火打刦，竊取財物，有謂消防人員均屬失職，肆意攻擊，涇渭不分影響整個消防事業，誠非淺鮮。按消防事業爲市民保隙安全之公衆組織，故其批評，事與人應該分開，即使有幾個人不好，當以不妨害整個名譽和事業爲原則，人犯罪有法律可以辦，失職亦可以掉換，但整個上海不能保險一天不失火，不能一天沒有消防員去救火，可知消防事業不可一日偏廢，那末要消防人員，盡忠職守，全體市民應加愛護與鼓勵，孰料此次武定路大火案，少數人士竟吹毛求疵過份攻擊，使整個機關失却人心，全體消防人員心灰意冷，這是社會的損失，不是幾個人的問題？現在全體市民的腦海中都懷疑着消防人員是竊盜財物的小偸，如此一來則不但在職的消防員不願做名譽壞而被人看不起的工作，個個準備著捲舖蓋，即未來的消防員恐誰都不願來接巷被人當作竊賊看的工作。</p>
<p>在現階段中消防員的工作，確有十分的困難，在每次救火時，如進入火房即有竊盜之嫌，不進入火房亦須受失職處分，如此一來救火人員有進退兩難，無法行使其職務之感。我以爲消防員如確有不法行爲，固應嚴懲不貸，以正邪風，但須憑着事實，不可以空言指責，莫須有而入人於罪，允不可指鹿爲馬，累及無辜，使整個消防人員聞而寒心。</p>
<p>再論責任問題；消防員責在救火　看管災戶財物，非其職責，災戶損失固爲一事，消防員有無竊取又爲一事，若謂災戶之損失，概歸罪於消防員，則米免過苛。</p>
<p>至於政府處理武定路大火案，可謂愼重將事，五人調查委員會對調查工作，亦極詳細而嚴格，凡進入火房者均移送檢察處偵訊，（見調查報吿書）當局旣決心根究本案，不惜犧牲下屬，以博社會之同情，則進入火房二十餘名之官警，不論其爲公爲私，有無過失均有隨時被傳被押之可能，吾望災戶應具天良速爲指證明確，再勿似是而非的含糊着。消防員如有知其劣跡，亦應自動檢舉，使敗類可以淸除，良善者得有保障，允望執法當局判明是非，勿涉無辜乃幸。（蕭樂友）</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十三日廣播：聯合國安理會今以九對零票。通過組成一特別委員會，研討各項縮軍問題，但曾由聯合國原子能姿會討論者則除外。</p>
<p>〔合衆社紐約成功湖十二日電〕聯合國安理會本日下午依照美國建議之方針，通過由十一國代表組織聯合國裁軍委員會，蘇聯反對無效。裁軍委會僅限於討論普通武器之廢棄事宜，一切「集體毀滅性」武器將由旣經成立之聯合國原子能委會處理之。安理　本日以九對零票通過此建議，蘇聯與波蘭棄權。對於裁軍委會本身，幷無一國反對，但蘇聯素不主張在進行裁軍問題時有權力上之區別，曾與美國不斷爭執，因此裁軍間題之討論已稽延六星期之久。至於上决聯合國大會提交安理曾討論之裁軍決議草案，尙待安理會之表決，安理會至此又需處理五强之否決權運用問題。如果安理會認爲此事，係原則問題而非手續問題，則裁軍決議草案可能將遭「否決」。但英美代表皆認爲，蘇聯代表葛羅米柯不致僅因反對權力上之區別，而否決裁軍計劃。根據本日之決議，安理會應設立普遍裁軍委會，由安理會十一國代表組織之，包括五强在內。裁軍委員會應在三個月之內，向安理會提出普遍裁减軍備及軍隊之建議，及保護愛好和平國家不受非法軍隊攻擊之有效保障。本日之決議並規定安理曾應儘速開始討論原子能委會所提呈之原子能問題。各代表定明日下午三時重開會議，以表決裁軍決議草案。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖十二日電〕英代表賈德幹今日在安理會之裁軍辯論中，勸告蘇聯勿再阻撓安理會之軍事參謀委員會，使該會所討論之聊合國車隊問題，得以迅速成立協定。賈德幹復建議着令軍事參謀委員會於四月三十日以前，提出完全之報吿。賣氏此外更支持美國之議，認為裁軍委員會不能干涉原子能委員會之任務，渠並間蘇代表葛羅米哥，蘇聯之反對此議，是否僅爲形式，果爾則請其撤回此種反對，使裁軍委員會得以迅速任命，法國及巴西之代表亦均支特美國之議</p>
<h3>愛因斯坦　贊成原子管制</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社美國新吉賽州普林斯頓城十二日電〕大數學家愛因斯坦，今日致函原十問題研究會，力言羣衆必須擴大認識原子戰爭之危險。其言有曰，「原子能在落伍的狹義國家主義概念中並無地位，因原十彈無法防禦，唯一的可能管制厥爲國際諒解」云。</p>

<h3>英承認保國政府　冀其履行和約義務享受權利</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫教十二日電〕英國於星期一在巴黎與保加利亞簽訂和的後，今復正式致牒保政府，聲明英政府已決定在法律上承認保加利亞政府。其照會內並聲明如下：英政府雖承認保加利亞政府，然對於前此表示之態度，即英國認爲保加利亞臨時政府未能履行其諾言，以實行民主權利之一點，仍繼續保持。此次之承認保加利亞新政府，並非表示英國已認保政府在選舉時所採用之方法，已與雅爾達宣言之精神及用意可以相符。英政府今覺保國旣已接受和的中規定之義務，故承認保政府，冀其今後得履行其諾言，以使該政府管轄下之一切人等，均能享受基本權利。保政府覆文，由總理狄密特洛夫簽字，對英政府之正式承認保政府，表示滿意，同時並允諾決履行和約之條件。惟對英照會中所稱，保政府於選舉時所使用之方法等點，則表示不能贊同。</p>

<h3>美軍領袖抗議　消減軍費</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕陸長拍德遜本日吿國會稱，參謀總長艾森豪威爾及太平洋區最高統帥麥克阿瑟曾對渠謂，共和一黨如擬裁减軍費，勢將造成不幸後果。按杜魯門總統所提出之本年度預算案，昨日由兩院預算委員會表決削減六十億美元，其中軍費被裁減十五億美元。共和黨若干議員對此亦表不滿，政府領袖並一致指斥稱，削减預算之結果，將破壞美國之海陸軍，且使國務院在談判對德和約時毫無後盾。柏德遜繼起發言稱，此舉將使駐留德日之估領軍在該地發生叛變時陷於危境，蓋德日如為訉饉所迫，可能發生叛變。柏氏並稱，以佔領軍所完成之任務而言，目前之經費及人數已達最低之限度云。另悉，衆院軍委會本日舉行秘密會議時，若干陸軍部高級官員曾提出，如果國會通過普遍軍訓乘，則陵軍部可同意將正規軍人數自一百另七萬减至八十七萬五千人。柏德遜及其僚屬並吿軍委會稱，陸軍部亦將計及緊急狀態下即能動員六萬八千名國防軍及十九萬五千名後備軍之問題，遍同微兵案之繼續執行，屆時足有五百五十萬名軍隊以應付事變云。</p>

<h3>日聯合內閣計劃　五政黨在折衝中</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十三日電〕日本五黨會議於今日下午未獲致任何決議而休會，故日本未來內閣是吾將爲容納社會民主黨及諸小黨之問題，尙需延至明日決定，會中經兩小時之討論後，雖經社會民主黨堅持藏相石橋湛山辭職形成表面僵局，但關於聯合政府之談判已獲極大進展。今下午自由黨，進步黨，社會民主黨，協同民主黨及國民黨所舉行之會議，聞因各黨代表在作最後決定前必須徵詢各該黨員之意見，故未獲致協議，但各黨已允明日議會舉行開院式後，於下午二時召開第二次五黨會議。</p>
<p>〔改造社東京十三日電〕以自由，進步，社會三黨爲中心組織聯合內圍之計畫，今日又於議會復會前夕，第三次宣告失敗。石檔藏相，河合厚相，及社會黨書記長西尾，中央水谷四人今晨舉行會談後，下午繼即舉行自由，進步，社會三黨幹事長會談，旋即舉行自由，進步，社會，協民，國民五黨領袖會談，數度協商組織聯合內閣結果，因社會黨仍堅主撤換石橋藏相，自由，進步兩黨反對撤換，意見不能一致，卒無結果而散。社會黨於下午六時召開中央執行委員會，決定放棄聯合工作。其他各黨對聯合工作，亦均表示悲觀。</p>
<p>議會今日復會</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十三日電〕日本第九十二屆議會明日開幕，會議期內，雖有若干要案提出討論，如一九四七至四八年之預算案，議會法與選舉法，及有關勞工與經濟之各種法案，惟日本政治家所關心者，似為　帥命令普選與立法在四月間同時進行。日本人民對於議會開幕時吉田首相所擬發表之演說，頗爲冷談，預料吉田將舊圖重彈，　請國人合作，以謀國家復興及經濟自立。吉田領幕下之自由黨仍在議會中保持多數，足以打銷任何不信任提議案。據若干方面暗示，反對派社會民主黨現在考慮對吉田內閣提出不信任案。</p>

<h3>英內閣設緊急委會　負責應付燃料危機　官民齊向嚴冬及煤荒作戰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦十三日廣播：英國今日仍處緊急狀態中，英國官民向嚴冬及煤荒作戰，艾德禮親自督率部下參加工作，天氣開朗，千百艘船隻南駛，載運煤及燃料遄返英倫，挽救凍餒之人民。西北部與西部軍隊出動，沿鐵路及公路進行掃雪工作，以利運煤。除主要工業外，所有其他方面之用電，均一律停止。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十二日電〕艾德禮首相今日宣布設立由內閣閣員及中央煤礦局，中央電力委員會，鐵路執行委員會代表合組之緊急委員會，以處理煤斤危機。該會於今日召開首次會後，議決緊急措施如下：（一）電力家庭用戶每日斷絕供應五小時之辦法，擴大施行範圍至於全國，意即家庭，商店，娛樂塲所於禁用電力期間一概不得用電；（二）有遠反者得科五百鎊以下罰金，處二年以下徒刑；（三）工業用電之取制辦法，不再擴大應用範圍；（四）賽狗之燃料消費，一概禁止。此外爲保障煤運暢通起見，議決：（一）有便利運煤之必要時，得隨時停目火車客運；（二）採取一切措施，便利煤船之交通；（三）由勞工部與工會協商後，增僱工人協助卸煤；（四）由運輸部撥供卡車，載運由火車運來之煤；（五）燃料及電力部有微用煤斤之權。斷電令施行後，已造成許多工人之失業，據估計，斷電區內失業之人已達，百廿萬人。</p>
<h3>太平洋中的軍界要地　密克羅尼亞羣島（下）　本報資料室</h3>
<p>今後處置辦法</p>
<p>在第二次世界大戰期中，美國佔領了這許多島嶼。戰事結束後，美國對於這三羣島嶼，曾經過一番考慮。最後美總統杜魯門建議，將太平洋中前日本委任統治各島嶼置於聯合國託管之下，而以美國爲唯一行政當局。此即是說：美國要代日本取得各島嶼的管理權，幷且要將冲繩島硫磺島包括在內。然託管制有不同於委任統治之處：（一）在委任統治之下，日本是被禁止設防的，但在所建議的託管制中，美國有權設立軍事基地。（二）在委任統治地是不准駐軍的，但美國的提議，得在該地駐軍和採取軍事行動。（三）過去日本不遵守規定，禁止在委任統治各島上遊歷經高，但美國的建議，對於聯合國的會員國，允許訂立最惠國條約。再按照聯合國憲章來看，託管委員會之管理權至爲狹小，安全理事會有權指揮託管委員會，將所謂要塞區域內之政治經濟社會敎育事項，完全交出。如此看來，託管僅是軍事的一部份而已。</p>
<p>今二次大戰已結束，而國際間之醖釀，仍極紊亂，甚至有許多人憂慮着下一决戰爭，即將降臨。在這動盪不安的局面下，美國要取得各島託管的特權，在島上設置軍事基地，使聯合國託管委員會無權顧問，這會不會遭到其地國家的歧視，乃問題關鍵之所在。現在蘇聯已有反響，反對將該島由聯合國安全理事會交與美國單獨託管，並聲明在對日和約未討論前，不能將該項戰略地區作任何最後處置。</p>
<p>這有關今後太平洋安危的各島，它們的處理問題，將必有一番爭執。太平洋的安危，當然和美國不能分離。過去因美國放過了獲得各島的機會，遭遇了這塲大禍，日本就利用該爲作爲向英，美，荷，華諸國作戰的工具。今後美國爲了保持太平洋的安全，自不能輕易放棄。但若美國在太平洋西部建立了軍事基地，在蘇聯看來，又不免覺得是莫大的威脅。</p>
<p>不過各島嶼究竟如何處理，還要看和會中的決議。而聯合國機構的原則和制度，實爲決定這些島嶼命運的前提。要維持世界永久和平，大家應該開誠佈公來繼續合作，決不可因二國的利害衝突，而造成陰暗的局面。</p>

<h3>華萊士撰文　論原子能　謂已成公開的秘密</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十二日電〕前商務部長華萊士在其主編：「新共和雜誌」內爲文稱，英法兩國以及某一斯坎的那維亞國家，均在建造原子能工廠，以為原子能尙能保守秘密者，恐僅美國人而已。渠謂，法國近在建迭原子分解機械，斯坎的那維亞某國，至少常有一具原子分解機器，可於年前生產。英國正在建造中之原子能廠，亦可製造原子彈，故美國已不能再稱須於他國可以信任時，始擬公開原子祕密。渠主張美國與其他聯合國合作建立世界安全制度，誠意覓取裁軍方案，不可再以原子祕密爲要挾。</p>

<h3>倫敦會議陷僵局　今舉行最後一次會議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十二日電〕外相貝文今日向阿拉伯代表團發表演說稱：巴勒斯坦問題之解決依然遙遠，猶太人與阿拉伯人倘繼續拒絕英政府之解決方案，則英國或將以此一問題向聯合國機構提出。貝文以目前僵局歸咎於阿猶雙方，而籲請雙方合作。據稱：雙方倘能運用充分政治家風度，自動覓求解決方案則可增加其國際威望。工黨反對一九三九年之白皮書，其中限制猶太移民每月一千五百名，英國感覺其有修改此項政策之完全權利，英國軍隊不能無限制實施此項限制。先是貝文聽取阿拉伯各代表說明反對英國計劃之原委。阿刺伯各代表力言巴勒斯坦應即宣布不分治的獨立，制止猶太人繼續移民，並充分保護阿拉伯人之土地。貝文允以彼等之意見轉達內閣，並稱英國之答復將於十四日最後一次會議中提出。除已提出者外，英國別無方案云。</p>

<h3>主席派鄭介民到滬　嚴密澈查金潮內幕</h3>
<p>淞滬警備司令宜鐵吾氏，昨對記者發表談話稱：日來金融波動，物價激漲，人心恐慌，整個社會充滿不安氣氛，一似火藥庫之爆炸，迫在眉睫，本部職責在維持治安，自不能熟視無覩，連日米店關門，實際上並非無米可賣，純係不法商人囤積居奇，以圖厚利，少數人之操縱壟斷，竟使多數巿民生活發生恐慌，其行為之卑劣，至堪痛心，本人已飭令稽查處及警察局，特飭全體人員，即日普遍搜查全巿米店，如有搜出存米，一律勒令開門，並派警監督出售，價格以一星期前巿價最高（約七八萬元）為準，全巿倉庫亦在搜查之列。現在米商輒以金價高漲為抬高米價之藉口，實則彼等所有存米，決非在自七八萬元漲至十餘萬元之時購進者。目前並非青黃不接時期，米糧來源決無問題，且政府握有大量食米，源源供給，絕對不　匱乏，米商藉口，實書毫無理由。本巿物價激漲，蔣主席異常關切，尤以金融波動，影響國家經濟至鉅，故已特派軍令部第一廳廳長鄭介民先生來滬，會同本人，進行澈查，此次黃金風潮，究係何人操縱，大量抬價收購者，係屬何人，所購黃金，運藏何處，均將嚴密調查，如查出有操縱金價擾亂金融之行為者，一定加以嚴辦，且決不使用經常方法處置。本巿物價狂漲，巿塲混亂之情形，顯非自然形成之現象，而係人為之結果，故政府決以人力加以克服，投機奸商，即將自食其果云。</p>
<h3>巿商會謀平定金融物價　條陳四項緊急方案　促即重行確立黃金政策</h3>
<p>對調節產銷安定民生均有建議</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海巿商會昨開理監事緊急會議，對抑平金融物價，決議電　政府，條陳緊急救治方案，其主要內容對重行確立黃金政策，實行進出口聯鎖，把握手資，配給日用品，及增加生產節約消費等四項，均有所建議。認為現階段之黃金政策，確有重加檢討之必要，決不能束手無策，任聽自然。以為政府今後黃金之運用，祗能就下述兩點中，選擇其一：（一）如果存金充沛，有如當局履次之所宣述者，則應立即繼續大量平價拋售，並同時發行實物庫劵，以吸收遊資，於二年或三年以後到期時，以黃金發給本息。為針對人民保障幣値之心理，可劃撥黃金準備，激請民意機關與工業金融團體代表組織「黃金準備檢查委員會」按期公開檢查，示民以信。（二）否則由政府立即宣布停止現行黃金政策，澈底禁止黃金投機，使金價與物價脫節。且認為兩者之如何選擇，必須迅即決定，不容拖延。</p>
<p>實施配給控制物價</p>
<p>關於把握物資，控制物價一點，認為可仿行英國之配給制度，藉以安定物價，穩住工資。即政府就民生日用所需，必要時向國內外購儲各項物資，一方面將已把握之物資如米，煤油，紗布等，實施定期定量配給制度，辦法務求其公允，期間務求其準確，必如此方能控制物價，而不為黑巿物價所左右。物價旣能穩定，則原料隨之低廉，工資亦可以保持其一定水準，不致隨時波動，引起紛爭，然後工廠可以安心工作，即出口貿易，亦當有逐漸好轉之希望。</p>
<p>聯鎖制度草案全文</p>
<p>關於實行進出口聯鎖制度，並附擬調整進出口貿易辦法草案全文如下：</p>
<p>（第一章總則）第一條：為振興出口獎勵必需物資進口，藉以繁榮經濟，調整貿易差額起見，特訂定本辦法。第二條：本辦法施行後，前頒這修正進出口貿易暫行辦法及獎勵輸出貿易辦法，有與本辦法抵觸者，同時修正或廢止之。</p>
<p>（第二章輸出）第三條：凡一切貨物除附表五（禁止出口物口）所列者外，均得自由出口，但出口商應提出指定銀行之證明書，證明其外滙用途，送呈海關騐訖，方准報關出口。第四條：出口所得外匯，指定須作進口所需外匯之用，由指定銀行辦理其關聯手續。</p>
<p>（第三章輸入）第五條：凡一切貨物，除附表四（禁止進口物品）外，均應照本辦法之規定辦妥手續，始准輸入。第六條：附表一所屬各項貨物，（生產器材）進口商得向中央銀行申請法定外滙，由政府供給之。第七條：附表二所屬各項貨物（原屬限額制度）及附表三甲所屬各項貨物，其所需外匯，應由進口商自行輸出土貨，或另向出口商洽購出口外匯抵補之，其價格不受法定外匯率之限制，但政府為獎勵工業器材原料之輸入起見，得另列附表准許進口商依進口金額之五分之一，向中央銀行申請結給法定外匯。第八條：由政府指定若干銀行，為經營外匯銀行，凡進出口商之外匯供求，及其證明，悉由指定銀行辦理之，並每週具報中央銀行。</p>
<p>（第四章低利貸金）第九條：凡合乎規定之進出口交易，具備一切證件者，（定貨單信用狀運儎契約等）得向指定貸款銀行（中國銀行）申請低利貸款，由指定外匯銀行辦理承兌，定期以三個月為一期，必要時得續展三個月，利息按月二分。第十條：為防止囤積貨物起見，到期償款日，應將海關之出口證明書及進口證明書繳呈核查，如屆時未能提出證明者，作囤貨論罰，責令補還照行莊計算之利息，或六出申請貸款當時所塡之定貨數量。</p>
<p>發放貸款　鼓勵生產</p>
<p>增加生產節約消費，農林部曁中國農民銀行應即宣佈本年度農業增資計劃逐步實施蠶絲，茶葉，桐油，猪鬃，棉麥等　製貸款，應掃切委節，大量貸放，勿誤農時，並得規定以產製之實物償還借款之一部或全部，其價格由雙方按照巿値評定。此項辦法，亦得適用於各工廠之貸款。政府控制上項實物，為外銷及平價之需，國營機關之生產品，應儘量推廣外銷，國內消費應緊縮至最低限度，以謀增裕外匯平衡收支。</p>

<h3>通告各業勿盲從漲價</h3>
<p>巿商會昨通告各業云：遷啓者，旬日以來，金價狂漲，物價亦隨之上升，其激烈趨勢，為戰後十年所僅見。似此情形，非但國計民生，瀕於絕境，商界同在圖片載之中，如果　折　崩，詎有倖全之理。本會為此日夕憂惶，有不得不正告於我商界諸君者。國家幣制自改用管理通貨制度以來，黃金與法幣，已失某連擊性，換言之，黃金旣不復為國幣發行之準備，即不復為各種物價之尺度，黃金在巿面之自由買賣，其巿價上落，祗等於珠寶鑽飾之巿價上落，不應再有左右物價之可能。祗因近年以來，一般心理，易受激刺，恒有過度之猜測，此外更有推波助瀾者流，預測某種物價將騰漲至何種程度，互相傅播，如果見怪不怪，則此種伎倆，自屬無計可施。無如人心虛軟，易於波動，往往釀成一倡百和，彼此競賽之局。此種心理，其初無非為避免後來「補進缺貨」之局面，其居心尚出於自衛，惟短期間內，工資幫料租金利息，亦必隨之上升，其漲價所得之利益，適足隨之冲銷，於事實仍屬無補，釀成帳面雖盈，實物短之局面，此正今日一般正當商人內心之痛苦。本會為商人集團，此種畸形現象，深以未能設法解除，引為內疚。依照上述情形，則今日物價上漲，與戰前有兩種截然不同之現象，戰前必成本增高，然後物價上漲，現在則往往物價先高，成本後漲，此種相反之現象。完全為動盪之時局所造成，質言之，即由於不安心理所播弄，結果於人有損，於已亦無利，本會除已另呈政府條擬重定黃金政策，實行進出口聯銷，把握物資，控制物價，增加生產，節約消費之辦法外，希望我商界以冷靜之理智，應付此困難之局面，非確係成本增高，切勿先行盲從漲價，即有必須漲價之理由，亦須以合法利潤為標準，勿為過度之狂漲，免與論　指摘，法令之制裁，易勝企盼，務希貴會分轉諸同業週知為企。</p>
<h3>孔祥熙　函當局　請查　造謠　眞相　事關國家安危　豈僅個人名譽</h3>
<p>中委孔祥熙氏，因邇來金價暴漲，謠言頗多，昨特分別函請吳巿長程監察使派員澈查眞相，以明究竟，而正視聽。其致吳巿長函云：「國楨吾兄巿長勛鑒，查地方之安危，在社會之穩定，近日金價劇動，人心惶惶，百物高漲，實打破空前未有之紀錄。推原其故，純由於奸人造謠，或希投機謀利，或則別有企圖，希冀擾亂上海治安，而連日變本加厲，對弟個人憑空揑造，屬加攻訐，借小報之廣布，起社會之不安，影響所及，對弟個人名譽固無足重輕，面於國家之安危，社會之穩定，至關重要。上海為中外通商重心，於避留之友邦人士安全關係尤巨，如任不逞之徒，妄造流言，致起巿面紛擾，則吾等何以對國家對人民？此事關係至重，即希派員澈查眞相，並嚴懲造謠奸人，以定人心，而保本巿安全，是所盼荷」。至程監察使函，內容大致相同，茲不錄。</p>

<h3>巿長懇切表示　居民應各安心</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳巿長昨於巿府接見記者時談稱：渠對本巿一般主要物品之價格，正竭力設法使其平穩。渠認為目前一般物價之動盪，主要係受金鈔價格波動所影響。惟連日樞當局，正籌劃金融經濟統盤對策，並將就近付諸施行，故金鈔之波動，顯已成强弩之末，不難一擊而就範。就巿府管轄所及之諸主要物品而言，食米問題，巿府現有充份力量，源源供應食米二百萬包。故在今秋新米登塲前，本巿食米，決無問題。日來巿府且每日按每担六萬三千元之價格，拋售西貢米一萬担。該項數量，已足敷全巿一日之消耗量而有餘。巿府且為防範各米店大額出售予客戶，私自囤積起見，昨起且派警察抽查各米店售米情形，以杜流弊，而使巿民均能購到平價配售一萬二千包，決不中輟。食油方面，民營各廠缺乏原料，現正覓求解決辦法。惟國營中國植物油，仍照常辦理。深望巿民應安心自處，切實與當局合作，則投機者無從施其技倆。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕蒲石路合大里十四號諸姓家，僱有女傭沈阿毛，（廿六歲湖州人）近因病經送往小沙渡路四七一號其姑母陳文君處暫住，數日後病勢日惡，遂於五日由其姑伴送至巿立第四醫院就醫，至七日不治身死。淮經醫師檢騐結果，死者胸膝部均患重傷，恐係生前被人毆傷致命，經其姑據情報告江寗分局，由陳股長派股員王琦率警盧天賜顧松林等偵查，得悉死者生前與一廚司吳成炳姘識，吳現在杜美路十九號供職，經承辦警員八日將吳拘獲帶局，供認戀愛確為事實，但否認毆辱，後又將在同號張許靜家為女傭之阿寶阿齊兩人傅局偵訊，始供出阿毛尚有一情人嚴阿慶，又名麻皮阿慶，為單帮生意，住址不祥，僅知其有一親戚魏羅生者，在雲南路菜巿街口春江旅館為茶房，嚴由鄉來滬時，恒闢室該旅社。警員至魏處詢問嚴之下落，悉阿慶已回吳興縣雙林鎭謝邨原籍。當由承辦警員，　夜乘車出發，至上述地點，詎嚴在是晟已帶貨赴滬，乃追蹤返申逕至春江查訊，果在該旅社捕獲，帶局偵訊，惟渠亦否認一切。經兩女傭證明，二日晚八時左右，在該號灶披間內，吳成炳先至，戀之嚴阿慶亦來，阿毛應付為難，吳成炳忽然先行，並稱誓不再來。未　，阿慶與阿毛頓生口角，阿毛即被阿慶揮拳亂擊。該分局預審後，嚴雖無毆傷左證，然涉嫌重大，擬將吳嚴二人併送地檢處核辦。</p>
<h3>郵資加價　尚未核准　經費收支不敷　郵局困難重重</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪郵局某負責人，承告有關郵政種種：（一）郵資漲價事，總局方面確已向政府提出，但是否能邀核准及增加若干，則尚未可知，事實上即使漲至平信五百元亦不敷彌補郵局之虧耗。（二）郵政總局長徐　莊辭職後，部派霍副局長接任，但霍氏因郵局困難重重，堅請辭卸，至迄今尚未能辦理移交，形成僵局。（三）因郵政收支不敷，當局有减低員工待遇之意，但事實上欲使員工减少其已得之待遇恐難實行。郵政事業如長此以往，終非了局。渠認為解決之法唯有三途並進，一為政府核准加價，並繼續貼補，二為人民諒解郵局之困難，對於加價勿予攻擊，三為郵政員工應本和衷共濟之義，對於待遇肯作讓步以共渡難關。（四）本巿郵局最近又實行一種新設施，係在衝要地區添置特別郵筒以收遞京滬沿綫特快郵件。此英郵筒漆成灰色紅字，收信時間較普通郵筒延遲，凡在晚間十時以前投入之郵件，可由夜快車於次晟送達京滬沿綫各城巿。</p>

<h3>電話公司問詢處　〇九小姐的任務</h3>
<p>專事檢查答復電話號碼　晝夜不息工作緊張熟練</p>
<p>〔本報特寫〕當你要打一個電話，而不知道電話號碼時，只要撥「〇九」一問，困難就可迎刃而解了。</p>
<p>「〇九」是上海電話公司問詢處的號碼，它的專門任務，是回答關於電話號碼的查詢。</p>
<p>「問詢處」日夜服務，二十四小時中從不間斷。每天分四班，每班有十二位「〇九小姐」，回答各項關於電話號碼的查詢。</p>
<p>她們的工作非常緊張，平均每個鐘頭，每人要回答五十幾次詢問。由於她們都有二三年以上的經騐，工作非常熟練。</p>
<p>她們所檢查的電話簿是活頁的，旋轉的，中文依筆劃多少排列，英文以字母先後為序。由於經騐的累積，她們已經記住每個字的筆劃，所以查起來極迅速。</p>
<p>不論電話簿上有沒有的電話號碼，她們都能够查到，但是有許多黨政要人，社會名流，軍事機關不願意發表自己的電話號碼，她們也拒絕回答。</p>
<p>查詢電話號碼，以酒樓，旅館及戲院為最多，而這些地方的電話號碼，「〇九小姐」都已爛熟，用不着查，立刻就能回答。最忙的時間，是下午二時至四時。</p>
<p>「〇九小姐」最感頭痛的，是常常有些人，藉查詢電話號碼為由，故意纏繞不清，妨礙她們正常的工作。</p>
<p>「問詢處」還有一項重要的工作，就是隨時記錄各項電話的移動。因為有許多電話常常易主，變更戶名，為了查詢的便利，變更戶名，為了查詢的便利，她們也必須隨時更換電話的主人。</p>
<p>會說話的「鐘」</p>
<p>除了電話號碼問詢處之外，電話公司還有一種鐘點服務。你如果要知道標準時間，只要撥「九五六七八」，就可以聽見有人用上海話和英語輪流報告。</p>
<p>詢問鐘點的時候，有一點需要注意，就是你不必開口，因為報告鐘點的小姐，耳朶是用陳塞堵住的，你無論如何大喊，她也聽不見。</p>
<p>普通我們撥「九五六七八」以後，總以為報告標準時間的小姐，在直接回答我們，其實她祗是坐在那裏，看着標準鐘，永遠不停的向傅聲筒報告。她並不需要接電話，她的工作僅是不停的報告。每十五分鐘換一個人，大家輪流。二十四小時中從不間斷。她們總是坐在那裏，報告着「十點十五分，Ten　Eifteen十點十五分…」這也許是全世界，最機械的一種工作了。一個年輕的人，變成一隻會說話的鐘。</p>
<p>在話筒前不斷報告時刻的小姐（本報攝）</p>

<h3>安定生活　社會局擬定辦法　日用品配售制　市府今日討論項目為米煤油糖鹽布等七種　暫限公敎文化界及產業工人</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局吳開先奉主席電召，於昨晚搭夜車晋京，商討抑平本市物價事宜。吳市長因公務繁忙，未曾偕行，紡建公司總經理束　章則因病由副總經理吳味經代表，於昨晨去京。</p>
<p>吳局長昨日在私邸接見記者談稱：去年社會局之工作重心在處理勞資糾紛·本年度之工作重心則在如何能使人民生活，因如果工廠破產。工人失業，而至同歸於盡，則亦無所謂勞方與資方。</p>
<p>生活指數增高　勢必陷於危境</p>
<p>近日物價波動甚烈，人民生活大受打擊，一般公敎人員，產業工人及文化工作人員掙扎於飢餓綫上，實不能淇視。設不採取有效辦法予以切實補救，則以生活費指數之增高，必將影響於一切製成品之成本，以各貨成本之增高，更必影響於一般生活費用。如此循環往復，輾轉增高，勢必阻碍生產，增加失業，使整個社會經濟與社會秩序陷於無法維持之危境。前聞主席辦對公敎人員配給日用必需物品，以安定生活，日前本人亦向吳市長建議對本市公敎人員，產業工人及女化化工人員，實行配售平價日用品制，待有多餘，再成立物品供應處，平價普遍配售於一般市民。該項辦法則將提交十四（今日）上午之市政會議討論。但因配給物品之米，油在糧食部執　中，煤由燃料管理委員會執擊，布由紡建公司管理，故本人正候宋院畏來滬，以使請示。現宋院長旣尚留京，本人又奉主席電召，故待去京後與有關各方接洽此事。</p>
<p>關於辭職事，吳局長稱；本人目的非為做官，而為做事。現所擬配售平價日用品制，吳市長已表示決全力支持。如能行得通，則擬試試。否則社會局不能行事，仍將辭職。</p>
<p>本給辦法主要內要內容</p>
<p>社會局為安定生活，抑平物價，擬具第一步配給辦法，其主要內容為：</p>
<p>（一）配給物品限於生活必需品，其項目及各戶分配額暫定如下：（甲）米每月一擔，（乙）煤球每月一擔，（丙）食油每月五斤，（丁）糖每月三斤，（戊）布每季一丈五尺，（己）鹽每月五斤，（庚）麵粉每月兩袋，（凡不　食米者，可申請改配麵粉）</p>
<p>（二）配給對象（甲）本市及中央駐滬公敎人員，（乙）本市公用事業工人及產業工人，（丙）本市從業文化事業人員。以上甲項人員之員額以其依法核准之編製為準，乙丙兩項人員，以各該所屬團體經當地主管官署依法立案者為限，但每戶之中有一人以上從事上述各項工作者，祇准配給一份。</p>
<p>（三）凡國營或政府管理之工廠，其出品合乎上開第一條之用途者，應照配給機關核定數量，先行提供平價配給，其餘由各廠自行銷售。</p>
<p>（四）各廠工人申請配給時，各該廠之出品如有合乎上開第一條之用途者，得由配給機關核定數量，平價照配，其餘仍由各該廠自行銷售。</p>
<p>（五）凡民營工廠其出品在上開第一條之外（如肥皂。火柴。香烟·醫油等），而其工人經申請准予配給者，得由配給機關核定數量分別令飭平價照配，以資推廣</p>
<p>（六）凡提供配給品之工廠，其電力等需要，得予以優惠待遇，充分供給。</p>
<p>（七）配給物品之價格，由配給機關另組審議會共同擬定，呈請市政府核定後，公佈施行。</p>
<p>（八）凡許可配給之工廠，其工資如照生活指數計算發給者，其指數中所含各配給物品，應依照配價，另行核算。</p>
<p>（九）上項配給事務，由市府組織臨時機構，負責辦理，其編制及經費另案呈請核定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕小本生產貸款問題，前經冬令教濟委員會第三次常務會議通過原則，交由蔡殿榮，孫詠沂，王先靑三委員審查擬訂辦法，現悉已決定貸款分十萬，二十萬，及三十萬三等，免息，祗需一家舖保，三月歸還。申請人不限失業工人，凡貧苦市民皆可請求。此項救濟辦法不似散發救濟麵粉等祇為消極工作，而使平民能作積極性之生產工作。現冬令救濟委員會即於今日下午三時假市府二三五號室召開第二次全體委員大會，小組會屆時將此小本生產貸款辦法，提交大會討論，並請撥款二億元以作貸款。待冬令救濟委員會於三月間結束後，貸款事擬由市公典繼續辦理。</p>
<h3>勸工大樓流血案　地檢處定期傳訊　陳施君有無罪嫌　偵查後始能斷定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕勸工大樓流血案承辦檢察官劉用之，已於昨日簽發傳票，定本月十八·十九兩日，分別傳訊被王玉祥等三受傷工人控告唆使傷害之三區百貨業工會理事長陳施君，傷重身死之梁仁達家屬，及當時經黃浦分局拘獲之互毆工人廿一人。檢察官認為此案在法律上並不複雜，惟毆傷梁仁達之兇手，一時頗不易拘獲，希市府方面調查，能有發現，對偵查上有所幫助，至陳施君究竟有無罪嫌，需俟偵查始能知　。</p>
<p>吳開先談　應懲禍首</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕社會局長吳開先昨對記者表示，認勸工大樓流血案為不幸事件。日前社會局會召集三區百貨業職業工會理事長陳施君談話，彼亦不能否　召開此會係屬錯誤，現兇手固應嚴懲。但召集開會之　　亦應法辦，因不開會即不致造成　案也。</p>

<h3>銀根告緊游資轉向　金鈔已漸形穩定　收盤價較前回漲五十萬</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕烚赤昨已平穩，大部游資轉往紗股活動矣，晨初報載緊急對策，不日實行，晨開六七〇萬至六九〇萬，即吿下落至六二〇萬至六三〇萬，十時後，央行以六三〇萬之價，配給六四〇條，此後形勢平穩，高價曾升至六九〇萬，銀根吿緊，且有紗布配給，游資轉向，近午低至六三〇萬，午刻站六五〇萬左右，午後隔日交割開出即迫七〇〇萬關，高價　七〇萬，而後轉趨恍惚，夜報載有禁做金鈔令，曾降至六七五萬，最後仍在七二〇萬左右，結果較前收回漲五十萬，飾金掛六十八萬元，銀元微升，暗拆銀根仍緊，息價在一角八左右。</p>
<p>外幣昨亦見平，美鈔晨開暗盤一萬二至一萬三，高價亦不過一萬四，缺少時殊變化，午後仍見穩建，惟交易似見呆滯，結果較前收漲一千元，港票自二千六左右，盤高至三千元關，結果絞前收亦好起一百元，外匯缺乏正式做開，業中人仍見束手，港匯减價二千七，印匯三千三，英匯四三五〇〇元，市况混亂，交易絕少。</p>
<p>連日金價狂漲　純係同行虛做</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨據金融界某觀察家談稱：近一二日來默察黃金走勢，似已從絢爛而歸於平淡。渠認爲數日前八九百萬之高峯，純係同行虛做之價，實際成交額極微。有實力及穩健之投機家，在市塲高喊九百萬關外之虛價時，亦唯有暫抱觀望而已，決不敢莽撞從事。今者當局緊急對策，又即將付諸實施，故預測金價前途，或將盤旋於五六百萬元之關口。至外傳資金收　國有之說，渠認爲未必可能。緣政府目前仍握有充份之黃金，足敷公開拋售及穩定金價之需。此時實施收歸國有，徒然刺激金價更漲，於實際反屬無補。惟渠信政府目前對黃金之施策，可能對人民日常飾物零星需要，仍照舊供給。惟對黃金被利用爲投饑對象之部份，將設法使之根絕。俾黃金不致再成爲投機波浪中之始作俑者。</p>
<h3>拋售黃金帳目　隨時可以公佈</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者爲外界要求中央銀行公布售金帳目，及買受人姓氏事，昨特趨訪央行業務局及稽核處等負責人氏，渠等咸以貝總裁迄未返滬，米便表示意見。惟稱：央行平日配售及拋售黃金，僅以認可之金業公會會員金號爲對緊。故帳目簡單，隨時可以公開云。</p>
<p>統債續降</p>
<p>公債昨仍見降，統丙</p>
<p>晨開六五〇元，即由六一四室四五二室脫售而退至二六〇〇元，五五〇室趁低維特而升至二七〇〇元外結束，結果較前收續跌三五〇元，甲乙各降二五〇元，丁戊亦挫三〇〇元，成交的三百萬元。</p>
<p>外股回好</p>
<p>外股昨稍回好，惟過程多盤，洋行帮向紙業會德豐進取較力，結果都以高價結束，結果較前收計航業升二成，英聯升成半，會德　怡紗升一成强，業廣紙業升半成，餘者咸吿微升。</p>
<h3>絲綢繼續回落</h3>
<p>絲綢昨市繼呈軟化，人造絲一二〇號有光上午開盤喊六百二三十萬元，迄後盤旋下降，退做五百九十八萬元有成交，午後不乏乘低補進，乃復上升，喊價六百十萬元，最後又抬高四十萬元，結果仍比上日短去二十萬元之譜。廠經昨亦因金價下降而低回，C字等級成交價參差不一，最大做七百五十萬元，最小做二十萬元，稍有交易，D字等級喊價七百萬元，比上日小去三十餘萬元，普通貨及千經喊價比上日均低二十萬元左右。綢貨因原料問落，廠盤亦皆减小，美亞被面喊四百三十萬元，人絲被面喊三百萬元，昨二百八十五萬元有成交，大誠格壁縐縐一萬六千元，華中縐掛牌六千二百元，六千元有成交，人絲羽紗貨缺，昨價與華錦縐同，盛杭各貨仍喊上日原盤，市塲中人心頗形軟弱，市勢尙有貶降可能，故昨日絲綢成交甚有限</p>
<h3>輸入許可證發給後　三個月內必須起運</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行外匯審核處，昨以第二類第十二號通函，分發各捐定銀行，對第二類第十號通函第一段之規定，有所修改。該函略稱：列於附表一及三甲之貨品，在輸入許可體發給之日起，三個月內，必須起運。又該項許可證之有效期問，自貨物起運之月之末日起，以四個月爲一限。</p>
<h3>茶市交易稀少</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，雖在春雨滂沱中，然出口行對於各式外銷茶，續有需求，同時專供內銷之龍井，大方等花色，本街店莊亦頻思添納，是以市上一片買聲，惟執貨人心俏利如故，居奇扳守，致供應失調，交易稀少。</p>
<h3>粳秈雖無到貨　黑市昨已回瀉</h3>
<p>食米雜糧兩市塲，連日瘋狂之市面，昨已開始回跌，人心虛怯，各貨在賣氣籠罩下，行情一致向下，執貨者居高思危，暗中吐售，兼之社警兩局加緊取締，特在各馬路口嚴查米糧移動，故米商身受的束，深具戒心，各米店亦因門售不易，未便吸進，市乃展開慘烈跌風，塲外喊價一致狂退三萬餘元，高白粳十三萬五千元，後市尙無受主，市塲內仍呈停頓狀態，惟糯米到貨漸增，一一市共有七百餘石，市况亦　疲象，社會局配售之二號西貢米，因出貨手續未辦妥，故昨市暫時停配。</p>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>因米價下降，人心動搖，貨主逢高脫售，進戶束手不前，在售多求少之情勢下，行市乃直綫下瀉，各牌粉猛跌五萬六千元，兵船。老車粉午收五萬五千元，利朗洋粉臨收七萬二千元，後市此價均無受主，有續　之望，隨粉市下降二三千元。小麥亦跌三四千元。</p>
<p>食油</p>
<p>銳跌不已，緣日前上漲之後，與各地行情已能合划，客商頗多運來，致昨市晨開即在一片賣出聲中，而受主寥寥，簍生油開即跌至二十四萬元，後再退至二十三萬元，吉桶生油最低跌至二十五萬元，午收二十六萬，生油劇瀉四萬餘元，豆油交易雖少，市亦暗降三四萬元，小車蔴油亦挫三四萬元，吉桶菜油跌至二十七萬元有成交。</p>
<p>雜糧</p>
<p>黃豆跌勢尤烈，乃東北方面有四艘來貨，其中一艘已到埠卸貨中，故人心大爲虛弱，供樣充沛，貨主急脫求現，大連。天津貨最後均依七萬元有做開，的回瀉萬元光景，其他亦挫七八千元，芝蘇僅黃蔴有小數交易，市亦跌二萬元，生仁供過於求，下瀉四五千元，猶乏接手，豆餅原料價疲，散戶爭脫，價回挫三四千元，荼豆苞米，均疲而乏交，棉餅亦挫二三千。</p>
<h3>煤炭趨勢轉軟</h3>
<p>煤市賣戶漸見增多，然喊價依然漫無標準，買戶因煤價連日劇漲過巨，且各項物價均見回跌，咸具戒心，進意甚爲懈怠，是以交易頗為清稀，開平火車塊，實際成交價已自一百十萬跌至一百零二三萬元，鴻　塊亦有趁一百五六十萬元高價拋言，故煤市趨勢有轉軟可能，柴炭新價行盤，雖已喊出，然進者均以價格過高難以下手，故交易亦爲平淡。</p>
<h3>紗市實銷沉寂</h3>
<p>昨日紗市續趨下游，業中人售意殊股，然實銷寥寥，客帮旣不進辦，廠家亦觀望不前，是以念支紗又降三四十萬，趨勢頗有養　不振之狀。</p>
<h3>調整收紗價格　尙須請示院長</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡管會第廿四次例會，於昨日下午四時，在市府會議室舉行。到吳兼主委，李副主委，委員王啓宇，榮鴻元，唐星海，郭棣活，紡管會業務處長劉文騰，秘書處長王子建等，討論至六時許散會。主要議案有三：（一）根據國民營及外商紗廠代表討論技術座談會之結論，修正棉紗檢騐標準及等級規定。（二）修正採取紗樣辦法，在第四條中加（丙）一項，文字爲：「前項所取樣紗及筒管，在試騐完畢後，分別歸還各廠」，其他照舊。（三）關於二月份收購棉紗價格之調整辦法，尙待請示宋院長後，方能決定。</p>

<p>布價平穩</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，開盤平穩，迄十時後，因金價下挫，拋售者多，三A彩球細布猛降一萬八千元，四君子及金印嗶嘰，跟落一萬三千元，惟高檔一九〇士林布，因染料堅挺，每疋僅小五千元，迨至十一時，聞紡建售布價格提高，人心又趨堅緊。</p>
<p>商情摘要</p>
<p>紙張</p>
<p>連日狂升，各級貨見頂高峯，昨日已吿回小，加拿大白報紙每令十二萬，小三萬元，其餘亦多跌降。普遍下跌，糖精四三萬，降五萬元，奎寗四十萬，挫七萬元，前途猶一致看疲。</p>
<p>捲烟</p>
<p>一致猛瀉，市塲一片喊賣聲，十支大英上午即瀉五十萬一箱，固本皂二三萬做開，猶乏人問津，美麗火柴退至二百萬元，洋燭仍未做開。</p>
<p>橡胶</p>
<p>原料存底稀少，貨主居奇，市勢再堅，長統靴秀氣允濃，猛升六萬元一打，惟各牌車胎去呆存豐，市勢平定。</p>
<p>五金</p>
<p>市况漸趨穩定惟人頭砂布到貨不多，銷路甚暢，每令漲達六五萬元，洋釘市跟金價下落，鎖類因原料高漲，成本遠超售價，鉸鏈類受廠無開出，市上貨稀，價格繼續昇騰中。</p>
<p>木材</p>
<p>洋松昨市由五千元跌至四千五百元，松板鋸方松木條子均下跌，杭木跌勢允勁，前日做價每兩四十萬元，昨爲廿七至卅萬元。</p>
<p>桂圓又升一成</p>
<p>桂圓近以到貨仍稀，開價連日又升一成之譜，大片元肉昨市又升一成，惟實銷較稀，趨勢可望轉定。</p>

<h3>新藥業向輸管會請求　改善西藥輸入辦法</h3>
<p>〔報訊訊〕本市新藥公會與數藥公會聯合向輸管會請求，希望根據藥品之性質。改善輸入辦法，凡我國已能自製之藥品，請禁止輸入，我國不能自製而本實上需要甚切之藥品，請准許大量輸入，俾我國製藥業不致受外貨輸入之打擊，而病家亦不致因藥品高價或缺貨關係，有所延誤，此項呈文已定於今日送呈云。</p>
<p>又訊，最近西藥價格，因美鈔高漲，平均漲起二倍餘之巨，據新藥公會某負責人稱，本市西藥業，所輸管會成立以前，訂購美貨極多，致各種美國藥品充拆於市塲中，價格普遍下落，且有多種藥品，跌入成本以內者，自限額輸入辦法規定後，許可證申請困難，加之美鈔黑市高漲，各藥品仍跟隨美鈔上昇，漲起一倍至三倍不等。普通冷門藥品的漲高一倍，熱門藥品如柏勒托，蓋世維雄，賜保命等則有高漲至四倍者，然以目前市價與美鈔黑市相較，仍不能算高，且最近行政院物資供應局已決定將所存一部份美貨阿的平與磺醃胺製劑，配售與各藥商，故該類藥品之市價可能保持平穩，又最近克蜜奶粉，孟山都糖精與拍勒托等，已有大量到滬，一般市價，可望逐漸回跌云。</p>
<h3>紡建配布　改用彈性價格</h3>

<h3>製革工業危急　三十三家倒閉</h3>
<p>本市製革工業危機四伏，業經正式宣吿倒閉者，已有二十三家，實際停工者估計至少亦有二三十家，考其原因，由於（一）成太昂貴，（二）洋貨傾銷，設若本年內無切實有效救濟辦法，一年後恐無一家製革廠開工，該業爲此特回經濟部提出建議，要求設法救濟，其辦法爲：（一）低利貸款，（二）免徵貨物稅，（三）配煤儘量供給，（四）不准熟皮進口及皮件結匯，該業之意，前三項辦法如能實現，底皮成本可关至八千元左右，而子皮成本可减至六千元左右，而第四項辦法實現，則售價可獲若干利潤，以使我製革業得以復蘇云</p>
<h3>食糖續跌</h3>
<p>昨糖市續見下降，後略回好，初小二三萬元，午後稍有回好，結果軋小一二萬元不一，公會劃盤大部均小二萬元以上，號貨順　　靑跌二萬元之譜，以十五元至十四萬五千元成交二百餘包，刁靑十五萬元，興赤十七萬五千元，台公司標售照舊，配額亦依五期類推，領購單時須負責人具結蓋章，以免再有黑市云</p>

<h3>籃球聯賽　常勝軍昨晚火併　巨人力戰勝仁餘　甲二組綠林敗於培爾</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕籃球聯賽甲組二幕，昨晚六時半起在市體育館角逐，近千球迷，冒雨前來觀戰，情况頗不寂寞。甲二部綠林不幸敗於培爾，結果卅比卅五，可謂冷門。甲一組常勝軍巨人戰仁餘，緊張異常，巨人以四十比卅五僅勝五分，上半時巨人以十七比十二佔先。戰情誌後：</p>
<p>綠林一球落後</p>
<p>首戰綠林逢培爾，雙方初戰頗爲文雅，培爾王爲公罰球首開紀錄，綠林葉云山還以顏色，此後雙方爭持不下，綠林呼停，培爾汪均炳又罰得一分，綠林葉云山覓機竄入，連中三元，八比四佔先。培爾汪鈞炳單騎建功，胡惠昭加上一罰，七比八僅落後一分。綠林再呼停，王存忠參戰，易出林少華，果見功效，陳正森葉云山各有建樹，十五比七，又見抬頭，奈培爾緊追不捨，陳正森連中二元，汪鈞炳錦上添花，前半時綠林僅以十七此十五領前一球而已。</p>
<p>培爾二分得勝</p>
<p>易籃後，培爾沈被章兩罰皆中，扳成十七平手，胡惠昭籃下托入，十九比十七，培爾超前，綠林呼停，仍未能遏止培爾攻勢，綠林士氣下沉，培爾則由沈被章一竄再竄，廿六比十九後來居上。綠林行動漸見激烈，林少華五次犯規畢業，隊長葉云山亦自動休息，至此綠林大勢漸去，培爾沈被章吳惠昭更左右逢源，卅一比廿四培爾領先時，綠林反攻益緊，奈時不我待，鐘聲響處，綠林終以卅此卅五敗於培爾</p>
<p>巨人日獗</p>
<p>壓軸戰甲一部仁餘與巨人登塲，巨人以陶勃林基，浮尼克，耶龍，谷佛，　沙司金臨陣，仁餘則以王槐庭，孫國鎭，李肇和，沈鵬舉，姚文彝五人相抗，李肇和罷球開把錄，　沙司金同樣回敬，浮尼克托人，陶勃林基探中，巨人以五比一超出，仁餘力爭，奈巨人猖獗異常，谷佛又見獲分，仁餘王槐庭罰球獲第二分，谷佛又百步穿楊，王槐庭建功，浮尼克兩罰俱進，仁餘吳新運人塲，易出李肇和，果見姚文彝中路難中，吳新運邊角破籃，巨人呼停，以强杜萊入替　沙司金，强社萊一擲一罰，下塲　能，迨上半時結束，巨人以十七比十二佔先。</p>
<p>仁餘惜敗</p>
<p>休息過後，易籃再戰，雙方俱以原人馬　戰，巨人谷佛陶勃林基雙中，仁餘姚文彝破籃，谷佛一擲一罰，又增三分，巨人猖獗異常，沈鵬舉王槐庭漸見順手，成十八比廿四，巨人呼停，飽列　沙司余人塲，浮尼克罰球得點，孫國政籃下竄進，吳新運連擲帶罰，仁餘突見振作，以廿三比廿五接近，巨人人馬再調，浮尼克籃下托進，姚文彝反身鵠中，谷佛建功，槐庭回敬，廿九比卅一，戰局緊張萬分。巨人又呼停，浮尼克破籃，谷佛身高手長，又吿擲進，卅五比廿九時，陶勃林基犯規畢業，鮑列入補，谷佛命中，　沙司金罰中，巨人不肯放鬆，仁餘沈鵬舉獲中，吳新運兩罰兩分，巨人緊緊相逼，時間告終，仁餘以卅五比四十遭巨人毒手。</p>
<p>巨人　犯分</p>
<p>仁餘犯分</p>
<p>陶勃林基　五六　吳新運　二六</p>
<p>鮑　列　一〇　姚文彝　二十一</p>

<p>王存忠四　二</p>
<p>共計　十六卅五　王介平二　二</p>
<p>葉云山三十三</p>
<p>共計廿四　卅</p>
<h3>論仁餘之敗　上半時戰略錯誤</h3>
<p>仁餘火併巨人，兩隊皆抱奪標雄心，競爭劇烈，過程緊凑。</p>
<p>上半時，仁餘試用五人聯防法，未臻純熟，浪擲亦多，遂形落後；下半時改用人釘人，漸上軌道，戰局精彩紛呈。</p>
<p>事實上，仁餘是一個最懂得還用法則策略的隊伍，巨人除了防守謹嚴以外，進攻祗憑硬殺拼力，照昨賽演出，仁餘有可勝之道，唯一敗因，在上半時戰略錯誤。</p>
<p>登塲之初，仁餘起用球藝生疏之李肇和，至爲失策，其後調入吳新運，乃見好轉。</p>
<p>巨人在上半時，乘仁餘陣勢慌亂之間　未利用中距離射籃，否則仁餘上半時失分更不止此。</p>
<p>仁餘姚文彝是射籃好手，但非全材，運球輸送，仍時有疏失。</p>
<p>下半時仁餘二次僅以二分落後，廿三比廿五——廿九此卅一，仁餘擲籃失的，未能追上，深爲可惜。　甲二組爆出冷門，綠林敗於培爾，綠林打來太驕見油，培爾穩紥穩打，卒能反敗爲勝。綠林球員不服裁判，一部份觀衆叱駡呌囂，盼以後能改善這種低落的「程度」。（昌年）</p>

<h3>南京大屠殺案主角谷壽夫受審記（下）　證人紛紛出庭述暴行　衆矢集中谷壽夫</h3>
<p>— 南京七日訊　本報駐京記者張明·丁匡華</p>
<p>今（七）天是公審戰犯谷壽夫第二天，觀衆人山人海，比昨天更爲踴躍。窗外滿站是人，這是首都審奸以來未有的現象。兩點鐘開庭，審判長石美瑜，慣例地先訊被吿姓名，然後再引人正題：</p>
<p>「經過本庭調查，被吿部隊侵人南京以後，即開始大屠殺，是不是因爲在攻城時遭遇了強烈的抵抗而採取報復行爲？」「中華門內外經過多日的激戰，居民早都退人安全區，庭長所說的暴行是錯誤的。因為在那樣情況下不可能發生暴行，也不必有暴行。假定說是有的，也絕不是本人的部隊所幹的。」「所有的證人衆口一詞，十二·十三兩天，係谷　夫部隊人城，中島部隊十四號才進城，那末最初兩天屠殺的行爲，不是被吿的部隊是誰？」「進攻南京的指揮官是柳川司令官，所屬有一一四師團和直屬部隊以及本人部隊，當時柳川司令官在中華門第一綫指揮，這都司以調查的。假便硬說南京的暴行應由本人負責，未免有失公正。且中華門一帶，因有戰爭，不可能有平民居留。故不致有屠殺的情形，並且要向天地神明發誓未曾見過平民屍體，十七日之入城式，十八日之慰靈祭，你都親自參加，當時南京遍地皆屍，難道你沒有見過？」各犯始終狡詰圖賴</p>

<p>南京市臨參會副議長陳耀東首先就證人席位報吿調查大屠殺案經過，據他說：調查的是基於正義的同胞，案人類文明的前途而着手，並且特地成立「南京市日軍罪行調查委員會，」由陳自任副主任委員，兼調查組長，調查結果，收到二千七百八十四件，根據日軍罪行分類，共有十種：（一）槍殺者一千一百五十九件，（二）刺刀殺死者六百六十七件，（三）集體屠殺者三百十五件，（四）燒死者一百卅六件，（五）打死者六十九件，（六）先刑後殺者三十三件，（七）先姦後殺者二十二件，（八）炸死者十九件，（九）水恢致死者十一件，（十）不屬於以上九類者三百二十一件，報吿畢，又說明兩點：（一）二千七百八十四件慘案發生地點，十之九都在中華門內外，也就是被吿駐軍地區。（二）自二十六年十二月十二日起至二十日一週中，殺人最多，也就是被吿郃隊駐京期間。最後，又說顧以參議負身份，代表南京百萬市民呼籲，當日參加進攻南京的日軍指揮官松井，柳川各罪魁都要引渡過來明正典刑。他的話一說完，全塲報以掌聲。谷壽夫在這一陣掌聲裏震顫了，身子好像在搖晃，但隨即裝作鎭靜。</p>
<p>接着四十九位證人出許庭作證，從他（她）們口裏道出當時慘絕人　的屠殺情形，那眞够人髪指了！</p>
<h3>許傳音　報告埋屍工作</h3>
<p>十年來，埋藏在證人們心底的是些什麼寃仇？且靜聽他們的申訴吧！</p>
<p>許傳音，紅十字會會長，他這麼說；「當南京淪陷時，我在南京，即担任紅會副曾長，同時担任國際委員會防守組主任。日本人進城情形，我都親眼見到。那是多麼混亂而可怕的局面啊！他們一進城第一是殺人，第二便是强該女人，然後燒民房，同時强搶民間財物。在進城之次日，就有日本軍官到紅會來詢問工作情形，當他們聽說有掩埋隊的組織時，就欣喜萬狀，吿以外面有很多死屍，你們可以去收去，這樣，我就可以在街上巡視了一番，從寗海路出來經新街口，過健康路至中華門，愈走見屍體愈多，以至於無洗數淸，我們的工作目然也很麻煩而困難，而且爲了富時的通行設很困難，所以掩埋工作不易進行，因此表上所塡日期雖是十二月廿二日，但其死期至少在一周以前，至於表上所載數目亦不相符，因當時懾於他們的淫威，不許多塡，所以塡入的數目是四萬餘，實際就不止廿萬，滿街盡是死屍，你會有一個感覺，那是到了一個剛才經過天崩地裂的區域，讓這無數善良的人羣就這麼倒斃在任何一個角落專了。」</p>
<h3>兩日人　輪姦陳二姑娘</h3>
<p>一個很純樸的村姑，陳二姑娘，短的棉襖褲，淺藍的單衫，黑髪覆着脸的半面。她呌喚着，應着檢察官的詢問。</p>
<p>「是的，我被日本人強姦了！有兩個日本人，兩個人輪姦了。」</p>
<p>有人在笑，是笑她不害羞嗎？不，今天她是第一次抬着頭向自己人陳述，她爲了贖還那洗不淸的侮辱，她在吼呌！</p>
<h3>姚家隆　妻女死大刀下</h3>
<p>姚家隆說：「那是十二號的晚上，外面放火了，我親眼見到的，他們拿大刀，有柄的，殺死了我最親近的人：老婆，兒子，女兒。」說的時候，聲浪顫抖着。</p>
<h3>桂袁氏　目覩兒子被殺</h3>
<p>袁氏八十歲的老婆婆了，她用很小的聲浪來回答檢察官的詢問。她的眼裏盡是淚，她沒有忘訊這十年前的一慕。她說：「我是親眼見到的，他們把我的兒子殺死了。」那天，在臨時調查庭時，她就是號哭着來申訴的一個，誰能忍受呢？自己的親骨肉被那帶着汚血的刺刀把他的生命結束了。</p>
<h3>趙榮生　頭部斫十一刀</h3>
<p>趙業生較長的身材，瘦，然而很有精神的，他繪影繪聲的敍述着：「我和一個鬼子這麼搏鬥，他有刀有槍，可是我有拳頭，我有拳術，他這麼打過來，我就這麼還過去，很長的時間裏，他僅僅傷了我所有不足致死的地方，於是我把他打退了，我在血泊裏延長了我的生命，如今，我的頭上有十一個刀痕，頸間有兩個槍疤，左手中指被打折掉了，右手也給打得變了形。」這都是些鐵證，他舉起兩手，兩隻非常人形的手，誰聽着都有一種自慰，他一起碼是一個英雄呢！</p>
<h3>張孫氏　丈夫被擊兩槍</h3>
<p>懷着那麼憤懣的氣概，她有滿腹不願吿人而不能不吿人的話。她說：「我和日本人的仇恨多呢！三天都說不完的。我的丈夫被他們打了兩槍死了，怎樣死去，我沒有見到，只是聽得，我們沒有看一看的自由。我親眼見到的是：兩個小姑娘，一個是我的小姑子，一個是我的朋友，兩個不滿廿歲的小姑娘被他們强姦了，她們幾乎被殺害了生命。」</p>
<h3>柯有福　送掉十三條命</h3>
<p>柯有福說：「我們是一個人口衆多的人家，但是，他們把留在這個家裏的人全都殺光了，一起是十三條命，我的父母兄姊弟妹和伙計，以及四個房客，等我從外面回來時，只見屍體到處都是，但是我幸而能免的原因，還爲的是被拉伕而出啊！」</p>
<h3>郁畢文　七刀兩槍傷疤</h3>
<p>郁畢文的自述，是有點近乎傳奇的。「我們一共有六個人，被他們閃亮的刺刀包圍住了，當然，我們只有死，我們在刺刀尖裏全部昏死過去，但是，像夢一樣，我又醒轉來了，然而正是我恢復良知的一剎那，又讓魔鬼們發覺了。他們把我又加上了兩槍，立即我又暈去，但是到了午夜，我又復活過來，這麼，我就生活到現在。」他把衣服敞開，七刀兩槍的創痕，歷歷在目。</p>
<h3>陳福寶　訴述集體屠殺</h3>
<p>陳福寶帶着一個顯得與衆不同的神態，很有條理的訴說他要說的一切：「我分五點來說明：那時我已經進入安全區的難民所裏了。但是隨時都拖出來做這做那，（一）他們把我攆出去到了一個地方，我記得是卅九個人，排成一排，他們把機槍開動，我們的同胞，就這麼應聲倒地了，還要我去把尸體推到池塘裏去。（二）一天他們把我帶出去在民房裏去搜羅財物，收集好，就呌我背好。當時，我曾親見到他們在一個地方輪姦一個少女的事情。（三）他們把我們當作玩把我們一一推倒，如果沒有推倒，就殺，推倒了就笑，這樣，翻復的玩着，我們同胞的生命就是這麼完結了的。（四）太平路環球飯店，我是親眼看到他們放火燒燬的，而且在同一天，我看到現在還存在着的一位攝影師的太太，在懷孕中被強姦以至流產的事。（五）一天，他們再度進行大屠殺，把我們集合起來，表示願意安定我們的生活，要我們說出自己的志願，是願意做工還是願意回家。說完後，要大家跪在地下，磕頭，謝謝他們，誰知等到我們從泥濘的地下站起來的時候，他們又用武器把我們押走了。大批的人都被他們殺害了，眞是安居九泉，樂業還土。」</p>
<p>審訊，報吿，申訴，是一部血的歷史，淚的泉源，仇恨的故事。而惡魔谷壽夫，今天終於在正義的面前低頭了，他在這些證人的面前，顯得極度的侷促不安，雖然他似乎一邊還細心地檢視着手中的一本南京全圖，一邊注意着被害人口中所述的時間和地點，作他强辯狡賴的準備，然而，事實又怎麼能輕易掩飾或狡辯得了呢？</p>
<h3>谷壽夫罪無可　知三天受審的一幕</h3>
<p>十二十三兩天　罪行責任又推中島</p>
<p>八日，是審訊戰犯谷壽夫的第三天，仍是下午二時開庭，旁聽座上，位無虛席，一層層黑壓壓的人頭壓着人頭，因爲今日是被害人及證人控訴谷犯所部集體屠殺最殘無人道的事實的陳述，所以比往常來得更擁擠了，庭上的空氣也顯得非常的激憤。二時零五分，被告舉步，蹣跚入庭，法官宣佈繼續調查罪行證據，由各證人對當時之屠殺情形陳述甚詳，並附帶調查谷犯在石家莊及保定一帶刧掠財物，强迫婦女肉體慰勞之事，經翻譯官譯述之後，谷犯舉手請求發言，略謂：兩日來根據證人所述，罪行大多發生於中華門一帶，實際上十二十三兩日，在調查文件中被吿發之許多罪行，都爲中島部隊所爲，不在其防區內發生。以上陳述請庭上加以注意。</p>
<p>被害人梁庭芳　投江後被開槍掃射</p>
<p>至此，續傳被害人梁庭芳，白增雲，陳福保，殷有餘，朱光榮等證人。其中有孤苦伶仃的寡婦，失去兒子的慈母，身披道衣的僧尼，白髮禿頂的老翁，虎口餘生的受害者，不同的身份，不同的年齡，衆口同聲，痛述當年日軍暴行及目擊慘狀，供述最慘的有好幾位。梁庭芳稱：『二十六年十二月十六日上午十一時，日軍七八人，至五條巷難民區，提難民數百人，押至華僑招待所，時已有數百人等候所內，至午後五時，已從各方聚集五千多人，四人一排，押至下關江邊，大批日軍已在等候，架好機槍，俟一高級軍官坐小包車前來，向全體日軍訊話後，開始慘無人道屠殺：自九時起，分批織射一小時後，復用刺刀刺殺氣未絕者。渠本人與白增雲兩人投江，日軍即向江內掃射，集中一彈未死，後逃出，數日後入城　好。』陳福保：十二月十四晨十時，親見三七位同胞被掃射，十四日下午，見三日軍於陰陽營一小學內，輪姦一女子。十六日見太平路環球飯店及生生木器行，被日軍縱火焚燒，又見鄰人孕婦被日軍輪姦流產。二十七年一月五日至八日，中島部隊誘我同胞七百餘人，集體予以屠殺。朱光榮謂：親見日軍部隊打有「谷」字小旗，至渠宅殺其子，同時被殺者，尙有六男一女，並見二女被姦，嗣日軍皆以刺刀自二女陰戶挑割，至胸口肚腸流出，葉于氏謂：於十四日，伊懷孕八月餘，被輪姦。</p>
<p>崇善堂周義瑜　曾埋屍十九餘萬具</p>
<p>崇善堂負責人周義瑜證明負責掩埋平民屍體十九萬七千餘人，另仍有馬吳氏等九人出庭，控訴親屬被殺，谷犯照例一概否認推諉乾凈。提及被告在石家莊保定等地縱容部屬搶刧居民陳嗣哲衣服，古玩，並强迫婦女作肉體慰勞時，谷犯狡稱：「當時在香月司令官指揮下，忙於準備南下進軍之際，搶刧實無可能，亦不會有。被害者或於戰鬥期間，或係華軍便衣及漢奸搶刦，不會有强征婦女成立慰安所作肉體慰勞。」種種狡辯，無非想逃避他罪行的責任。</p>
<p>構成四項罪行　縱火搶刧強姦屠殺</p>
<p>至四時五分，庭諭休息片刻，隨即繼續開庭，開始辯論，陳檢察官光　目先指陳：被吿實構成起訴書上所列之罪行：一曰縱火，當時南京遍地大火，日軍且不許人民救火，違者即予殺害。二曰搶刧，當時日軍到處搶刧，且無物不搶。三曰强姦，一婦人曾遭强姦卅七次之多，一女人因拒姦而被刺卅三刀，一十五歲之少女，因遭三日兵輪姦而被殺，旦以竹竿插入其陰戶之中。四曰屠殺，集體殺害最多者，有五萬七千餘人。此外有三萬餘人一批，及二萬餘人一批者，至敎百數千一批者，不可數計。其方式爲先用機槍掃射，再用刀刺，而後火燒，或投入水中溺斃。例如燕子磁一次，即有七千餘名被解除武裝之國軍，被趕入江中淹死。其最慘無人道者，爲以鐵絲穿通民人之喉管取來，及以　生菌注射俘虜，作試騐二事，更有人已被殺七刀，死而復甦後，被敵發覺，又補了兩槍。凡此種種，均證明日軍之殘暴。依據各處屍體之掩埋統計，死者已超出二十萬人，加以其他未經掩埋或未曾統計在內者，最謹愼的估計死難者當有四十萬人。</p>
<p>歸納證件報告　被告應負五大罪責</p>
<p>被吿所應負之責任，可分下列五點來說：（一）依據市參議會之調查報吿，中華門一帶在二十六年十二月二十日以前發生之案件，有五百餘件。其時地皆與被吿在京之時地符合。（二）根據程潔律師之證言，中華一帶之傷者特別多。（三）證人中有二人目擊各部殺人。（四）大肆殺爲集體行爲，參加者即須負責，不能以之推諉。（五）十四日以乎前無其他部隊入城，而十二三日已大肆屠殺，故被吿實爲大屠殺之發動者，是罪魁禍首。至證據方面，有市參會及地院之一調查報吿，紅十字會及崇善堂之原始掩埋紀錄，外人及日軍自行拍攝之照片等，罪證確　，鐵案如山，如不能提出有力反證，而徒以推諉狡辯爲事，自難卸脫責任。中國人向以寬大仁慈爲懷，並未對日軍有何報復行動，且將渠等安全遺送回國，但對於主犯，如谷壽夫等，則不能予以寬容，應予判處極刑。</p>
<p>言畢，旁聽席上一片　聲，谷壽夫在聆聽日語翻譯官譯述時，神色已不復如前之自若，時而搔自弄鼻，時而茫然仰視，狀極狼狽，但他仍是不肯招供，希圖抵賴。旋又稱：「以揣測作根據，不能構成犯罪條件，犯罪事實，應將加害者與被加害者兩造傳訊到庭，纔能決定犯罪有無，單方陳述，不能成爲犯罪事實。被吿希望能够獲得公正而沒有錯誤的判決。」至此，天已很晚，庭諭另期開辯論庭，以待谷壽夫自供自招。</p>
<h3>西太平洋　沿岸　第一高峯：玉山</h3>
<p>— 廿日台北航訊　本報物派員江暮雲</p>
<p>海島台灣氣象上最顯得特殊的是新高山。日人統治時代，登新高山需要許可證，現在仍舊要發派司，可是沒有同行的團體和勇氣，攀登斯山，畢竟是困難的事。</p>
<p>新高山，海拔三九五〇公尺，原名玉山，歐美人稱之爲摩里孫山（Mt-Morrison），是西太平洋沿岸第一個高峯。日本奪我台灣，這個山就成爲日本帝國中的最高峯，在明治三十年六月二十八日以天皇的敕令改名爲「新高山」。光復以後，新高山一名實亟應廢除，而恢復原有的「玉山」之名。</p>
<p>積雪紀錄</p>
<p>新高山位於中央山脈的中南段，正在北回歸綫上，位置逼近於台灣全島的幾何中心。根據新高山氣象台歷年的統計，冬季平均氣溫一度，夏季七度，（氣壓冬季平均481.2，夏季是482.5）從十一月到第二年的四月爲止是降雪的時期，九月到五月都有降霜。在山上工作三個月回來的氣象合工技正煜仁吿訴記者，他在去年十一月初在山上，平原上還是穿着單衫的時候，早在上旬，就飄了兩次雪。當時下雪地帶僅限於主山，下山還沒有八百公尺遠，就看不見雪。北山頂峯一帶，下雪的時問很暫，不上半天就溶化了。最高積雪紀錄曾達三米。冰凍在山頂是常有的，而天時很冷轉變得劇烈時，就會驀然地下起大大小小的冰雹來。一刻兒就積了好幾寸，冬夜裏只要天色晴朗，氣溫很低（全年最低氣溫爲12.1，最高爲18.9）翌晨在氣象台前後一定有結得頂厚的亮晶的冰塊。</p>
<p>因爲山上氣壓降低，造成了許多希奇古怪的現象，山上的行者常易患有一種莫明其妙的高山病—頭眩，耳嗚，呼吸急促，粘膜出血，食慾不振等病症，住慣了幾天才好。這裏造飯非用蒸氣鍋烹不熟，水要煮沸，在高山是再容易沒有的事。</p>
<p>雲的故鄉</p>
<p>高山最奇妙的事物，要算是雲。雲的變幻使高山人們像處在雲的故鄕。晨昏五色詢爛，時顯時賺，有時像汹湧的波濤，有時像輕紗嶧帶，有時則悄然歸去。一年中有七十七天的快睛，七十天不脫，全年二一八天有觀測可能。溫度很小，年平均75％，（平地81％）整個天體裏96％的星球可以觀測到，（可以看到地平綫下七·四度，北半球全部及南半球六·七度內之星球）同時因爲塵埃少，空氣透明，實是建設天文台最好的地方，本省氣象局預定設立天文台的三據點之一。</p>
<p>北山氣象台在明治四十二年十月東京帝大理科大學講師一戶直藏，小倉伸吉等四人，就結伴登山，把主山北山一帶的氣象，地磁，地理等作詳細測勘。當時就選定北山爲台址，民國三十二年始正式設立，到現在有五年歷史。現在北山有一座官舍，一座觀測塔，從官舍到塔，還有半小時的山程。觀測塔裏裝有一般天文儀器外，並裝有無綫電台和外間通訊。</p>
<p>氣象水源</p>
<p>氣象局在這裏派有六個觀測員和十個工役，那是主山北山一帶歡十里內外僅有的人羣。他們是站在自然界的最前錢，一面要和風霜雨雪搏鬥，一面得防止疾病野獸的侵襲，每旦三餐，所能享用的祗是陳舊的罐頭，新鮮的蔬菜在高山是珍品。這裏最缺乏的是水源，晴乾幾天，就得到數里外去取水，有時洗面都成為問題，祗有下大雨時，可以痛快地洗個澡。工作員四個月調換一次，並給有特別津貼，四個月下山後，使人不再認識他，簡直是像在古廟裏入定的老僧似的。道裏工役全是高山同胞，只有他們能攀登險峻的山程，抵抗得住那樣特殊的氣候和環境；他們經常地爲氣象台運輸，背負三四十斤跋涉常人空着手尙難於通過的棧道，險橋，而他們是怡然自得習以爲常的。</p>
<p>板岩構成</p>
<p>登新高山，都是從阿里山山綫終點兒玉，經三十分鐘到新高山而入山，山路崎嶇危峻；下面有一個登山宿泊所，也就是日人時代的派出所，建在新高主峯山麓，說是山麓，實際上已在山腰裏了。　從地質方面來看，高山是由一種略經變質的板岩，經過相當繁複的褶曲而構成的。這種板岩名「阿里山層」，是第三紀的海相沉積物，原度很大，在第三紀的中期褶曲成山，像阿爾卑斯山，喜馬拉雅山這些著名的山峯一樣，因爲誕生期距今很短，沒有經過剝削，多少尙保持原有的高度。</p>
<p>海島現在仍在秋天衷，可是人們就從沒想到新高山就終年浸在冬天裏，有平原從沒有看到的雪，和從沒感受到的寒冷，你會感到寄異罷？要是你願意　登，一定有豐富的收穫，唯一的條件是「勇氣」，「勇氣」！</p>

<h3>文人的勢利</h3>
<p>— 胡山源</p>
<p>凑巧，聽崑曲聽到了「金印記」，和「爛柯山」的上部，狠狠地爲蘇秦和朱買臣嘆息了一會。嘆息他們身爲文人，文不能拆字，武不會打拳，只會咿唔咕嗶地死讀當，受盡了婦人之氣。幸而後來他們總算都有了飛黃騰遠的日子，向那兩個婦人報復了一下，出了一口氣，使我們爲古人担憂的後世人聰到兩本曲子的下半部，心頭輕鬆了下來。然而嘆息方過，又怎能不使人發生感慨呢？古今來，受氣的文人，決不止蘇秦與朱買臣二人，而能够出氣的，似乎也就只有他們二人。其他氣到死，氣得昏天黑地，氣得生病，氣得一生沒有歡笑的，一定不知有多多少少。可憐哉文人！</p>
<p>不過我奇怪，蘇秦朱買臣既然受盡勢利之氣，等到自己得法了，照理以己之心，度人之心，就不應該也以勢利的面目對人了。爲什麼他們要在兩個無知的女子面前，也來上這一套呢？因此我要說，蘇秦朱買臣本來就是勢利鬼，濫小人，他們繁脚時的受氣是應該的，用不着向他們表同情。而應該問問表同情的，也許還是那二個女子。因爲她們是無知的，何足深責！那二位文人，蘇秦與朱買臣，他們是高人一等的知識階級呀！</p>
<p>知識階級，文人，何等淸高，偏僞會那樣卑鄙，勢利，那眞要呌人感慨系之了。並且放眼看看，道不但自古已然，簡直於今爲烈。有的一天到晚奔走於名流學者之門，希望自己也成爲名流學者。有的在大庭廣衆之間，趨承什麼大人物，作盡媚態，以示其「相公厚我厚我」。有的說漂亮話，寫漂亮文字，見好於人，獲得某種人的擁護，儼然以某種權威或某種大人光生白命。有的每逢有名人之會必到，到則從薄有微名的起，極盡拉攏的能事，東握一下手，西打一個哈哈，頗有「天下英雄，盡入吾　中」的意氣。……等到他果然成功了名流學者，或大人先生，那他的聲勢就格外浩大了：有人請寫稿，不說忙，沒有工夫，却說懶，沒有興致。即使寫，又惜墨如金，都只寥寥數語。有人請吃飯，却又說應酬忙，分不開身，一到，酒不數行，席不暇暖，連忙起身先辭，說別處還有應酬，偸偸地回家吃泡飯，在所不惜。無名的，年輕的來看他，可以回說不在家，同時，儘不妨對年高德劭的，聲名顯赫的，倒屣以迎。銷路好的醫，在他看來是最好的書。銷路好的雜誌是最好的雜誌。不問其內容如何。同樣一個無名作家的作品，不論是何等精心結構的佳作，如果向之請敎，可以連正眼都不看一下，或者沒頭沒腦地指摘一下，自稱法眼，當然他有他的看法，「成則爲王，敗則為寇」。沒有人要的東西總是壞的。因此，在他所主編的刋物裏都只是名家的作品。無名的投稿，照例是看也不用看而可以投之字紙簏的</p>
<p>我懷疑他們，他們也許正是。今之蘇秦朱買臣——他們曾受過別人的氣，所以在向別人報復，或者他們又比蘇秦朱買臣爲甚，因爲他們所報復的，又往往並非氣過他們的本人。他們正像養媳婦受盡了惡婆婆的氣，冉等到養媳婦自己長大了，惡婆婆已去世，無從報復起，只好將一肚子的氣出在下一代的養媳婦身上，而自己就承受了惡婆婆的衣鉢。又像賊骨頭成了更夫，拚命敵打賊骨頭以出其賊骨頭時代受敲打之氣。</p>
<p>然而我看看他們，到底又不是蘇秦朱買臣。他們米必受過別人的氣，用不着向誰報復。他們只是一種趨炎附勢，自命不凡的卑鄙心理在作祟罷了。</p>
<p>實在說，一爲文人，便誰也用不着勢利。誰不在受書商出版家的氣？誰不在受富商大賈的氣？睢不在受官僚政客的氣？誰不在受流氓光棍的氣？誰不在受　種骯髒氣？爲什麼偏偏要在自己的同道中裝腔作勢。擺闊邊威？</p>
<p>這樣看來蘇泰朱買臣，寃有頭，債有主，畢竟還是可同情的，我們現代的文人，大都便只有可厭可恨了。</p>

<h3>愛羅先珂</h3>
<p>— 沈思</p>
<p>愛羅先到是俄國著名的言詩人，早年他曾到過中國但是對於中國女人包小脚的事却不　淸楚，從前他聽見。：「中國人包括　　　全是包小脚的。　　看不見，有一次淸末外交家李鴻章到俄國去，這位盲詩人私自偸偸地去摸了李鴻章的脚，結果證明並非小脚，但却遭了一頓痛打。</p>
<h3>思念</h3>
<p>— C.G.Rosscttl作（萍籌）</p>
<p>思念着我，當我走向遙遠的</p>
<p>寂靜的另一個世界中去的時候。</p>
<p>那時，你將不再能握住我底手。</p>
<p>我也不再能半回過身來和你道別。</p>
<p>思念着我：沒有多餘的日子</p>
<p>能容許你訴語着我們的將來了。</p>
<p>就這樣地思念着吧！你知道</p>
<p>談心是太晚時，人就只能祈禱。</p>
<p>或者你會將我忘掉。</p>
<p>當再記起來時，不要傷感。</p>
<p>因爲：</p>
<p>假若死和腐爛還會留下一些</p>
<p>我的痕跡：</p>
<p>我寗願你忘掉而愉快，</p>
<p>不願你思念而憂愁。</p>
<h3>關於文天祥二三事</h3>
<p>— 譚正璧</p>
<p>歐陽夫人生死之謎</p>
<p>天祥逃出虎口後，乃在福安擁立益王爲帝，以右丞相都督江西軍事。空坑一戰，全軍皆敗，天祥妻妾子女被執，自己幸而得免。「文山先生紀年錄注」有云：</p>
<p>空坑敗潰，卒意公所向，疾至隨護。公命五百擊手斫山樹爲鹿角池隘道。頃之，數人負傷至，則五百拏手已摧踣不支。公即去。夫人驚問故，則追騎已林立於前，夫人與佛生，柳小娘，環小娘，顏孺人，黃孺人等皆爲俘虜。夫人沿路意有深水險屋，即投死，而一路坦平，至元帥所，巳失佛生，必有愛其俊秀，養爲己子矣。</p>
<p>「紀年錄注」又記夫人後隨公主下嫁高唐王，居大同路豐州栖眞觀。大德二年，由嗣子陞迎回南方原籍。後死於大德九年二月十九日，葬於富田南二十里洞源。照此說來，夫人在被擄之後，沒有戰死，是千眞萬確的了。但「文山集」卷十五「吟嘯集」中有「哭妻文」云：</p>
<p>烈女不嫁二夫，忠臣不事二主。天上地下，惟我與汝！鳴呼哀哉！</p>
<p>此文作於已卯，爲夫人被擄後二年。寥寥數語，既悲哀，亦　矜。道時天祥又爲元人所據，不得夫人噩耗，當然不會無病呻吟。所以淸人飽廷博以爲各書載夫人死後尙在，乃誤信「宋遺民錄」所載張毅夫訪求夫人一事而誤。今人丁傳靖以爲張毅夫所訪，爲夫人遺骸，又謂鮑氏乃誤讀「宋遺民錄」原文。正史亦以收天祥屍者即爲夫人，大的就是根據「宋遺民錄」的。殊不知劉岳申與胡廣的「文丞相傳」，均以收屍者爲十義士，而「帝京景物略」亦云</p>
<p>江南十義士，舁公藥葬都城小南門外五里道旁。大德二年，繼子陞至都順城門，見石橋織　人婦，公舊婢綠荷也，爲陞語，乃歸葬廬陵。</p>
<p>照語氣看來，那麼織綾人似即爲江南十義士之一。正史據「宋遺民錄」以爲收屍者乃夫人，豈不與此矛盾？所以夫人之死，確是一謎。或者在天祥被擄時，得夫人自殺之傳聞，故有「哭妻文」之作，而夫人實未死。但到後來天祥被殺，始終未獲夫人消息，故集中未去其文。但如夫人能於天祥死後收屍，那必能與天祥未死時通信，可見收屍之事，亦未必有。所以似乎應從「紀年錄注」，夫人隨公主下嫁，後由嗣子迎歸，較爲近情理也。</p>
<p>天祥有一妻二妾二子六女，都見於他自己的詩文中。「集杜詩」「妻第一百四十三」序云：</p>
<p>丁丑八月十七日空坑之敗，夫人歐陽氏，女柳娘，環娘，子佛生，環之生母顏，佛之生母黃，並陷失，聞自隆興北行，惟佛生已死。</p>
<p>「長子第一百四十九」序云：</p>
<p>予二子，長曰道生，姿性可敎，不幸辛亂離，隨家飄泊，空坑之敗，惟脫身自全。鍾愛於太大人，以疾後太夫人六十日死於惠陽郡冶中，生十三年矣。</p>
<p>「二女第一百五十」序云：</p>
<p>予六女，長定娘，次柳娘，次環娘，次監娘，决奉娘，决壽娘。丙子，定娘，壽娘以病死於河源之三角。丁丑，柳娘，環娘陷，惟監娘，奉娘得存，戊寅潮陽之敗，復死亂兵中。</p>
<p>一代忠臣，家破人亡，至於期極，可慘極了！「紀年錄注「云：</p>
<p>柳小娘從公主下嫁趙王沙靖州，大德年間歿。環小娘從公主下嫁歧王西寗州，弟姪輩間得會於都城。至正元年辛已歲，猶傳聞其居沙州養老，皆無所生。</p>
<p>所謂從嫁，所以把她們當做滕妾陪嫁。柳娘和環娘乃係閩女，既已國破家亡，有此收塲，倒也不必說。獨是元主把隊陽夫人，也當公主陪嫁，那麼正史所載他的敬重天祥，簡直是虛僞萬分。這時的夫人，年齡至少總在四十左右，而尙不肯放她守志終老，不把她和她的兒女們一樣使滕妾遺嫁，這正是敵人對俘虞最酷虐的手段。天祥地下有知，更當切齒萬分。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血　168</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「我這有一句補充、」鶴見也笑着，口氣的似乎有袒護，耀羣的意味，不問廿以下或以上，這個都不能作爲十分肯定的證明。我本人就親眼看見于打以上的日本老太太，她們的腿脚，沒有于點日本的特微；因爲她們都是生長在外國，從來就沒有穿過木屐……我却有一個心得，您各位可以批評批評……」鶴見說到這裏，天眞的笑起來了，把剛才w君所引起的緊張氛園，都化解了三分之二。屋子裏的空氣，沒有那們嚴肅了</p>
<p>「這倒要叨敎一下；」耀羣對這一點似乎感到特別興趣。</p>
<p>「您知道，」鶴見的臉頰上又泛起了一陣血暈，「她們雖可不穿木展，但在家的日子，因種種風俗，不能不學習跪坐。詭坐的日子一久，那一雙脚踝不能不起變化。換句話說，那一雙脚踝，一定扁平，不像別國的女子……」他的臉上更增加了一層血色，「他不能說是百分之百，還是有例外的。」</p>
<p>「日本女子也好，中國或外國女子也好，」我有些不願意他們把時間荒廢了；「幾位的意思，打算……」</p>
<p>「是……」君趕忙端正了顏色，「我計劃了一下，我打算今天晚上給他們一個警吿——給他們的火本營，來一個突擊！」</p>
<p>「哦！」這是鶴見的表示，一聽了w君這個提議，他負起手來，在屋子的空間裏，來回走着。</p>
<p>「好！」虎臣和耀羣同聲贊成。</p>
<p>「幹完了，我還要同虎弟上東交民巷去找她去。」　羣另外補上這一句。</p>
<p>我在幻想突擊的情形和後果，一時沒有意見，耀羣和虎臣的意見已經發表過了；w君還在等候鶴見的答覆，而鶴見刦往來　蹀，元自沉思不已。正在　靜無聲的當口，門上却有人輕輕叩了兩下。</p>
<p>「信。」一個外勤，把門輕輕推開，　進一封信來。</p>
<p>普通信封，我一瞧那字跡，就知道是剛才所說，鼎元的留別書。接到這封信，我有些踟躕，又想立時折開來看，又怕把大家現在集中的思潮——突擊計劃——牽動了。剛想把信藏在衣袋裏，鶴見木來從我身旁擦過去了，忽然回轉身來：</p>
<p>「能不能念給我們大家聽聽？我們這幾個人，對於吳先生都懸心得很；一方面，我還要看看我的猜測，究竟有幾分對。」</p>
<p>屋子裏的四雙眼睛，都集中在我和我手裏這封信上，我沒有游移的理山了，立刻折開了信：</p>
<p>「××學長我兄——前日申君來院，代表我兄存問，蒙兄等及紀小姐錦注，又蒙饋贈食用品多種，一一拜領，弟有何德，蒙兄等如此錯愛？刦難之餘，僅賸殘軀，今生亦不放作圖報想突。惟耿耿於懷者，拙荆及子女等共計六口，究遭何人參戮？兇手究竟爲誰？尸首埋在何處？弟病山模糊，似憶會數向吾兄叩問。蒙兄等體貼入微，恐病者傷心，托辭掩飾。兄等用心亦良苦。弟未得答覆魂夢　安。幸申君來，弟泣血跪求，始獲悉始末……」</p>
<p>鶴見聽到這裏，發出于聲「喳」的怪普；「這隊伙眞是一條笨蟲！」接着又咕出一句日本極下流的罵人語，以有我同w君懂得。虎成似平聽不懂信中的文句，然而看見大家慘然不歡，也有些意會得到，所以把頭　得很低。耀羣刦已經頻頻拭淚，背轉身去，瞧着窗口外面。</p>

<p>這幾天黃金，美鈔，白米，日用必需品價格飛漲，在投機市塲中以一舉手一投足之勞，坐獲幾百萬，幾千萬，幾萬萬法幣的大小「幸運兒」們，在公餘之暇，大家又得熟鬧一番，慶說一番，於是跳舞塲，酒家，戲院又擠得不堪了，好在所費不過幾十萬元，以與所獲的鉅額「利潤」相較，實在相差不多，大可「滿不在乎」一點。然而一般薪水階級，由於物價上騰，都在呌苦連天。實際上，「幸運兒」們所嫌的，所吃的，所跳的，所看的，都出在一般小民身上。這種情形，無以名之，祗能名之爲「小民大請客」。</p>

<h3>為證件而死</h3>
<p>— 顧奕聲</p>
<p>讀了本月十日本報所載，湖北省立第二女師學生何芳玲，以證件不實開除學籍，以致該生出走失踪一節，令人悲憤交集，我眞不惜政府和社會爲什麼如此重視證件，不知扼殺了多少有眞才實學的苦學之士，難道一肚皮的學問利一身的本領，還不足證明，而一定要這一紙空文，况且有證件的人，却很多是一團茅草，一竅不通，他們的證件，不是憑學問去得來而是用時間和金錢去混來的，在中學裏混了六年，出了十二學期的學費，混到一張中學文憑，在大學裏混了四年，出了八學期的學費，混到一張大學文憑，可憐我們中國有幾個是有閒階級的大少爺。</p>
<p>近年來的人才缺乏，其原因即爲了學生水準的低落，學生水準的低落，爲了學校的管理媽虎，其實都是證件在那裏作祟。在這祗重虛文，不求實際的環境中，學校和機關都以重視證件來表示其辦理之嚴格，和標準之高，沒有證件者要升學，學校不能容納，要就業，受社會上的賤視，證件之可貴如是，便有許多學店應運而開，它的課程，雖然折爛汚，然而它的證件，却照樣有用。這種學店，正配合有閒階級的大少爺的脾胃，平時逃課，考試作弊，好在學費照付，便有文憑到手，可以拿來欺世盜名向貧窮人示威，反過來看，幾十年的內亂外禍，生靈塗炭，萬姓流離，生活維艱，遑論入學，然而也有許多好學有志之士，在艱難困苦之中，努力學業，但是他們枉有學問本領，沒有證件，便駢死糟　之下，被這「大時代」所「淘汰」了，言之曷勝痛心！</p>
<p>所以要培植眞才，提高學生程度，消滅學店，惟有力燆重虛文，不求實際的弊病，廢除證件，採用嚴格周寗的考試制度，使學校出身的，和非學校出身的，都能能加角逐，則有眞才實學之人，便能脫頴而出，而學校中的學生也趨於請求實學，不專圖騙到文憑了事，學店也不敢再以滑頭貨來應市，英國敎育著名世界其考大學也不一定要有證件，吾國根擾什麼採用這種自殺敎育制度來戕賊人才，誰都知道歷來偉大人物，大都出身貧困，幼年苦學，紈絝子弟，幾人爭氣，為了救孜這千萬被埋沒的人才，爲了救救中國的敎育，爲了救救中國，敬　政府當道和社會賢達，急籌補助之方。</p>

<h3>雞蛋直立的　種種試驗</h3>
<p>— 朱慶童</p>
<p>對於鷄蛋能直立的事，筆者曾與友人作各種試騐，頗有新的發現。</p>
<p>生鷄蛋當然能直立，但若干熟雞蛋直立反比生雞蛋容易。有人以爲鷄蛋的直立乃因爲立春日空氣密度特別濃，筆者曾在直立鷄蛋之四週燃火，以减少空氣密度，但雞蛋仍直立無變化，大概此事與密度沒有什麼關係。</p>
<p>筆者再將生鷄蛋用小鈎子鈎去一部份的圓頂，將蛋白和蛋黃調和，不加蓋，試試看；直立也成功了！</p>
<p>我們將蛋黃蛋白去掉後，拿截去的一剖，仔細的用蛋白衣封好，成一隻空的鷄蛋，裏面一點東西也沒有，於是再試試直立看，用二手扶着放在地板上。只有一分鐘，又直立了！以後，通一分鐘也不要。空鷄蛋的豎立，比生的熟的更容易。</p>
<p>由於上數種試騐，可知蛋之直立，大概純粹是物理學上的重心問題。重心垂直於一點，則無論何時皆能直立，也不但是鷄蛋爲然。大科學家愛因斯坦看了，又有何感想？不會再斥爲「混蛋」了吧？</p>

<h3>最近被判刑的清魔攝影師</h3>
<p>— 麥葉</p>
<p>上月卅一日慕尼黑合衆社電說：「希特勒私人攝影師霍夫門，已被此問「德國納粹淸除法庭」判定作古役十年，褫奪公權終身；私產除酌留若干外，全部沒收。」電文雖然很簡單，但霍夫門這人和他的作品，我們並不十分生疏。</p>
<p>有憫畫家說得很有趣：『希特勒的臉型是「漫畫的」，羅斯福的臉型是「攝影的」，而邱古爾的臉型是「油畫的」。……三個字眼用得有點抽象，但事實上並非沒有根據。回想第二次歐戰結束以前的世界政治漫畫壇上，有誰能比「希特勒」這個典型的丑角更川風頭呢？</p>
<p>霍夫門的功勞，和對納粹的功勳，似乎就在把「漫畫型」的希特勒臉型，能够「藝體地」改變爲「攝影型」的這一點上。假如說戈培爾博士是希特勒的播音筒，那末，霍夫門就是他的幻燈放映機。透過這鏡頭，希特勒欺騙過億億萬萬納粹信徒的眼睛，一如透過戈培爾的播音器，欺騙過億億萬萬納粹信徒的耳朵。和戈培爾相較，道十年苦役未免太便宜了。</p>
<p>攝影正常人的常識山是最忠實的耙錄；但攝影在巧妙的操作下，其欺人之甚，亦無以復加。比方說，希特勒是個殺人不眨眼的一代魔王，但霍夫門却挑選了許多鏡頭，記錄下希特勒懷抱着未滿週歲的嬰孩那種做作的親暱狀態。希特勒是個高度神經質的「瘋子」，而霍夫門則拍攝爲一木眞經的肖像，德國人至今還數不淸，當年有多少納粹崇拜者是以霍夫門的「傑作」爲「觸媒」。</p>
<p>美國人以爲故羅斯福的照片流布最廣，但數字上證明尙不及希特動的一半。而希特勒的照片，則完全由霍夫門一手包辦。</p>
<p>納粹德國有過許多種以希特勒肖像為圖案的郵票，並無例外，這也是霍夫門的作品。</p>
<p>我們假如不健忘，當記得十多年前亞林匹克世界運動會在柏林舉行那一件大新聞。當時會塲內一切新聞照片和活動電影片的柏增權，是由霍夫門一手包辦，他不祗是一個攝影師和人像照片的能手，而且是個好的電影師。常年他提議在跑道旁築一條深溝，從出發點到決勝點與跑道平行，但僅有攝影鏡頭露出地面以拍攝選手的跑姿，而不陣礙觀衆和評判員的視綫。攝影機和攝影師都放在一部高速度的汽車上，在深溝下駛動。這計　實現了，許多鏡頭拍很非常動人。這新聞片在各國和上海放映過。</p>
<p>但我們不能忘記了白勞恩這個妖媚女伶在希特勒與霍夫門之間拉綫紫，人們有時說，霍夫門是希特勒這位姘婦介紹渦去而被重用的；但另有一說。霍夫門常替希特勒「拉皮條」，表面上看來是「無性生殖」的納粹魔王，誰曉得後宮也有風流　事呢？兩說屬眞屬假，怕誰也難以斷定，但霍夫門與老希的桃色事件有關，似不必置疑。可惜的我們沒有看到霍夫門的桃色鐘頭耙錄下來的　色和生活。</p>

<h3>Emergency Measures to Curb Inflation: Extensive Consultations Largely Finalized; Entire Plan Submitted to Chairman for Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The government is currently making efforts on two fronts to quell the current alarming situation of soaring gold prices, US dollar values, and overall inflation. Regarding the stabilization of gold and US dollar prices, Song Ziwen (T.V. Soong) and Bei Zuyi (Tsuyee Pei) are fully handling the matter. Measures to stabilize commodity prices are being drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in conjunction with the Ministries of Social Affairs and Food, the Transportation Commission, and the municipal and economic authorities of Nanjing and Shanghai. The entire emergency plan, after several consultations under the direction of Chairman Chiang, involving relevant officials over the past three days, has largely been finalized and will be submitted to the Chairman for approval on the evening of the 13th. The meeting at Chairman Chiang's official residence on the 13th lasted until 11:00 PM before adjourning.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs held an important meeting on the 13th. Wang Yunwu presided, and attendees included Pan Xulun, Xiao Lu, Gu Zhenglun, Pang Songzhou, Ling Hongxun, Wu Zhaohong, Pan Gongzhan, Shen Yi, Huang Bodu, and others. Opinions were exchanged on stabilizing commodity prices, and some decisions were made. The meeting adjourned around 3:00 PM. It is reported that commodity price stabilization will proceed on two fronts simultaneously. One involves distributing supplies in kind to civil servants, and the other concerns wages. The cotton yarn, fuel, and rice held by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Food will be distributed to civil servants. As for the distribution mechanism, the Ministry of Social Affairs advocates using existing cooperatives, and the Ministry of Transportation will assist with transportation. It is also reported that this will be piloted along the Nanjing-Shanghai line first. Measures are also being considered to stabilize wages. After the meeting, Wang Yunwu and others went to Song Ziwen's residence for further consultations at 4:00 PM and then to the Chairman's official residence at 7:00 PM for instructions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Regarding the supply of daily necessities to public school teachers and government employees, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has scheduled a meeting of representatives from relevant agencies for the 14th to discuss whether to provide rations of daily necessities to public school teachers and government employees, and what specific measures to take. Long Dajun, Director of the Control Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, went to Shanghai a few days ago to invite representatives from relevant agencies to come to Nanjing for consultations. Mr. Long, together with representatives from the China Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC), the Fuel Management Committee, and the Shanghai Materials Supply Bureau, including Wu Weijing, arrived in Nanjing this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen is expected to arrive in Nanjing on the morning of the 14th to attend an important meeting held by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Wu Weijing, representing CTIC, and Xu Shanyang, representing the Fuel Management Committee, have arrived in Nanjing ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The tentatively named Economic Policy Research Committee is being organized, with a preliminary list of fifteen members including Song Ziwen, Yu Hongjun, Chen Guofu, Xu Kan, Chen Lifu, Pan Gongzhan, Xiao Zheng, Lou Tongshen, and Huang Yuanbin. The committee will be established after Chairman Chiang's approval. The number of people will be eight or nine, and some prominent figures from the industrial and commercial sectors will also participate.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Ministry of Food has dispatched Shen Guojin, Director of the Storage and Transportation Department, to various provinces along the Yangtze River to supervise the transportation of food grains in order to regulate supply.</p>
<h3>The United States Cannot Stand Idly By in the Face of China's Economic Chaos: The New York Times Comments on China's Financial Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 13th (Radio): The New York Times commented that the catastrophic drop and subsequent rebound in China's currency value demonstrates that the country's economic collapse may not be as rapid as generally imagined recently. This rebound may only be temporary, but unless the Chinese people still have some faith in their government's ability to control the crisis, this temporary stability cannot be maintained. It would be a grave mistake to think of this as merely a Chinese problem. It is also an American problem, and a serious one, because the United States is a friend of China, and we cannot stand idly by and watch it fall into an irrecoverable situation, commented the New York World-Telegram.</p>
<h3>US Halts Loans to China: Precipitating China's Crisis</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 13th (Radio): The New York World-Telegram commented on China's economic crisis, saying that this situation was caused by the United States halting loans to China. The newspaper also criticized [John Carter] Vincent's policy of distrust towards China.</p>
<h3>US-China Trade Stagnates: Importers and Exporters Hit Hard</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 13th] The Executive Secretary of the American Importers and Exporters Association, Wright Clevely, stated today that fluctuations in the Chinese legal tender (fabi) have brought US-China trade to a standstill. Importers and exporters are the hardest hit, and American firms are now canceling orders en masse, awaiting a stable situation. Unless the value of the legal tender is firmly established, we anticipate repercussions within a week. This can be seen in the reduced number of ships sailing to the East. "We can only hope that the Chinese government recognizes that the US dollar has three different values in China." The Chinese government's foreign exchange buying and selling rules, limiting the purchase of imports and exports to a maximum value of US$2,000, as well as last week's implementation of a 50% import surcharge, the proceeds of which subsidize exports, are also factors restricting trade.</p>
<h3>US Will Not Impose Additional Taxes to Resist Chinese Import Taxes</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Regarding the Nanjing government's subsidization of Chinese exporters, the United States will not impose additional import taxes on Chinese goods as a countermeasure. A Treasury Department spokesman stated today that the US Tariff Act of 1930 stipulates that if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that foreign goods have been subsidized by their government, an additional tax should be levied on these goods upon entry into the United States. The decision rests with the Secretary of the Treasury. If the Nanjing government's export subsidy measures are deemed to fall within the scope of the US tariff law, then punitive additional import taxes may not be levied on these Chinese goods. When similar situations have occurred, thorough research is required before a decision can be made, and the same applies to the current situation in China. US officials hope that the Chinese authorities can maintain the value of the legal tender themselves, and the United States will not provide any assistance. The United States will not provide loans for any specific Chinese projects at this time, and the Export-Import Bank's accounts for China have been temporarily sealed.</p>
<h3>Factors Contributing to Soaring Prices: Legislative Yuan Nine-Member Committee to Prepare Report</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The issue of gold prices and commodity prices will be a major topic on the agenda of the Legislative Yuan's general meeting on the 14th. The Yuan's nine-member committee will present an important report at the meeting, explaining the various factors contributing to soaring prices. The seven most serious problems currently identified in the report are as follows: (1) The government focuses only on one or two industries and businesses that are easier to manage and more profitable, and state-owned enterprises often raise prices first, leading the way for private enterprises to raise prices. The cost of daily necessities has skyrocketed, and all prices have increased over ten thousand-fold, seemingly without end. (2) The issuance of paper money increases daily, and production loans have not been fully implemented. The authorities believe that selling gold and controlling foreign exchange can lower prices, but the issuance of paper money cannot keep pace with production. The more paper money is issued, the higher the price of gold rises. The so-called lowering of prices has the opposite effect. Moreover, China is not a gold-producing country, and current foreign trade is almost zero. The existing foreign exchange reserves are also not unlimited. Speculators see the loopholes and stir up trouble. The government fails to notice this and uses loans to fuel the rising prices, leading to an uncontrollable situation. (3) Most state-owned enterprises do not benefit the people's livelihood, and their illegal and excessive expenditures are staggering. The China Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC) has illegally spent as much as 42.7 billion. (4) Since the government collected gold reserves and bonds from the people and paid US dollar bonds at the original face value, its credibility has been shattered. Furthermore, with the devaluation of the currency to nearly one ten-thousandth of its original value, the debt is still paid at one yuan per yuan, making it impossible to issue bonds, and funding relies entirely on paper money. (5) Subsidy policies only increase government spending and stimulate prices. (6) Public school teachers, government employees, soldiers, and police officers are often in a state of hunger and cold, while the Inspector General of Customs receives a monthly salary of 700 pounds in British currency, a vast difference. (7) There is an increasing number of overlapping and redundant organizations, creating positions for people and wasting public funds beyond estimation. In addition, the principles of the Four National Banks Law, which was previously subject to reconsideration, will also be discussed at the meeting on the 14th.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representatives and Others Stationed in Shanghai to Announce Their Views on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shanghai] National Assembly representatives and National Political Council members stationed in Shanghai, considering the severity of the current situation, held a joint meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at No. 1 Maoling Villa, Fulili Road. More than 30 people attended, including Chen Qitian, Jiang Yong, Jiang Yiping, Zhu Fengwei, Duanmu Kai, Xi Yushu, He Yuanming, Zhu Huijing, Li Hongwen, Wu Yunshu, Wu Wentian, Jiang Jianbai, and Zhou Feicheng. Jiang Yong was elected as chairman. The chairman asked Zhu Huijing to give a preliminary report, which generally stated that at the close of the National Assembly, government reorganization seemed immediately achievable, but more than 50 days have passed, and it is still under discussion and has not been implemented. With the end of peace talks, the war has intensified, and the scope is expanding. Recently, the gold rush has surged, prices have skyrocketed, and the people cannot make a living. However, the central government's suppression policies are still pending. People are in a state of anxiety and cannot live in peace. As National Assembly representatives or National Political Council members, they have received the important trust of the people and should have a clear position. Therefore, everyone is invited to offer advice and discuss the matter at length today. Those who spoke in turn included Chen Qitian, Xi Yushu, Jiang Yiping, Dai Tianqiu, Jiang Jianbai, Hu Qiuhou, Duanmu Kai, Pan Lianru, Zhu Fengwei, and He Yuanming. The following was decided: (1) The government should reorganize as soon as possible. (2) A democratic political system should be established. (3) The highest officials responsible for creating the gold rush should be held accountable. (4) A law for the election of the next National Assembly representatives should be formulated, and we should participate in the process. (5) The government should be urged to establish a Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee as soon as possible. Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Zhu Huijing were appointed to draft the statement on the current situation, and Jiang Yong and two others were appointed to present the same statement at the meeting of resident council members. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Ministry of National Defense Forms Supervisory Group to Comfort Soldiers and Civilians in Southwestern Shandong</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 13th] The Ministry of National Defense has formed a Supervisory Group for the Southwestern Shandong Pacification Zone, with Teng Jie as the group leader and Wu Zhongya and others as group leaders. They will depart in ten groups on the 14th to comfort the soldiers and civilians in the Southwestern Shandong Pacification Zone.</p>
<h3>Supreme National Defense Council Meeting Postponed for Two Days</h3>

<h3>Gold and US Dollar Prices High But Unavailable in Many Places; Food and Supplies Rise Further; Guangzhou Authorities Announce Military Law for Inflating Prices</h3>
<p>Nanjing</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Nanjing gold rush, which began at noon on the 12th and continued until the morning of the 13th, saw gold prices plummet due to hoarders softening and selling off their holdings as much as possible. However, starting at 11:00 AM, prices began to rise again. By the time the market closed in the evening, prices had jumped back above the 7 million mark. The price fluctuations throughout the 13th were as follows: The opening price was 6.5 million for selling and 5.8 million for buying, which was then changed to 6.7 million for selling and 6 million for buying. By 11:00 AM, prices clearly rose, with 6.9 million for selling and 6.2 million for buying. At 2:00 PM, the price was 7 million for selling and 6.3 million for buying. There were slight fluctuations after that, and the closing prices were 7.35 million for selling and 6.65 million for buying. Overall, there were only sellers and no buyers in the morning, while the situation was slightly more balanced in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Commodity prices in Nanjing have soared recently due to the stimulation of gold and US dollar fluctuations. However, over the past day or two, while gold prices have fallen, the prices of goods in Nanjing that have risen have not fallen along with gold and US dollar prices, but have continued to rise gradually. During this latest surge in gold and US dollar prices, in addition to cotton yarn, hardware, and pigments related to foreign exchange, daily necessities such as food have also been affected by the fluctuations in gold and US dollar prices. Market prices fluctuate easily, and merchants in various industries are hoarding large quantities of goods, restricting sales, creating a situation where prices are high but unavailable. Gasoline has increased from 1,800 yuan to 3,000 yuan per gallon, and some gas stations have stopped selling gasoline. Those that remain open limit each car to only three gallons. Cars form long queues near gas stations, often numbering in the hundreds. Regarding rice, even if inferior rice is used as superior rice, the market price has risen to over 100,000 yuan per stone, but there are still shortages. Each person can only buy one dou of rice. The limited price of flour is 36,000 yuan per bag, but the market price has automatically risen to 60,000 yuan, and buyers are crowded, with supply falling short of demand. A small number of speculators profit from the rise in gold and US dollar prices, while the entire nation suffers from rising commodity prices.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>

Major General Cao Yongxiang presided over the meeting, and it was decided on the spot to organize a Suzhou Economic Stabilization Provisional Committee, under which three organizations would be established: a price negotiation and review committee, a price management enforcement and punishment committee, and a price investigation group. These organizations would begin their work immediately.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 13th] Hangzhou was hit hard by the Shanghai gold rush, and the market was thrown into chaos. The food market also experienced extreme fluctuations, and retail shops closed one after another. The authorities tried to remedy the situation and planned to release the rice stored in warehouses and the rice held as collateral for sale today, and instructed the grain merchants to handle it openly in order to overcome the difficulties. Furthermore, students in Hangzhou schools were required to pay rice as tuition, but it was difficult to purchase. In order to solve the difficulty, the authorities, together with the Department of Education, issued an emergency notice stating that all students who had not paid rice for admission would be charged the price of Grade 1 rice sold at the municipal food rationing committee's outlets as determined at the meeting of the committee on February 10th of this year. The schools would then use this payment to purchase food grain from the Department of Finance.</p>

The price once reached 12,700 yuan, but in the afternoon it was still hovering between 12,000 yuan and 12,500 yuan.

The retail price was 67,000 to 68,000 yuan per bag, up 5,000 to 6,000 yuan from yesterday.

<h3>Linyi Launches Battle for the City: National Army Advances in a Fan Shape; Communist Forces in Chengwu and Dingtao Also Encircled</h3>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 13th] The war situation in Southern Shandong is improving rapidly. On the morning of the 13th, the National Army advanced in a fan shape towards Linyi from Lijiazhuang, Huabu, and Nantou south of Linyi, and from Taishan, Cangshan, Zuo City, and Bianzhuang southwest of Linyi. By 4:00 PM, the vanguard was only nine kilometers from Linyi and had launched a battle for the city.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 13th] Fierce battles are taking place in the mountains on both sides of Biecang Town, southeast of Xintai. Furthermore, the Communist forces from the 7th and 11th Divisions and the Garrison Brigade, etc., gathered near Suozhen, north of Zhangdian, are attempting to probe the rear of the Liubo branch line. The National Army is on strict alert.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 13th] According to one report, the National Army's spearhead was active at the south gate of Linyi this afternoon. However, according to official sources here, the National Army was still conducting mopping-up operations east and west of Lijiazhuang, 45 li south of Linyi, on the 13th and accepting sporadic surrenders from the Communist forces. Because Lu Yi changed the Liberated New Compilation Divisions to be responsible for the central defense south of Linyi and transferred the main forces of the New Fourth Army elsewhere, it has caused a serious backlash from his subordinates. The Liberated New Compilation Divisions were reorganized from puppet troops and militia. They know that Chen Yi is forcing them to defend the central area south of Linyi in order to use their flesh and blood to block the National Army's fierce artillery fire. Therefore, many do not fight and collapse, and they surrender to the National Army.</p>
<p>[Further Telegram] According to front-line news, the National Army's entry into Lijiazhuang in Southern Shandong is tantamount to a central breakthrough in Chen Yi's outer defenses of Linyi. They are now sweeping towards both flanks, capturing the main forces of the New Fourth Army. Linyi has become an empty city. Furthermore, the Communist forces under Liu Bocheng have reorganized their 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th columns, totaling over 40,000 men. Starting on the evening of the 11th, they encountered the main force of the National Army in the area of Minquan and Yejigang on the western section of the Longhai Railway and fought fiercely for one day and two nights. As a result, the Communist forces suffered another crushing defeat, and the remnants fled north towards Caoxian. The National Army is pursuing them in several routes. Liu Bocheng led his troops with the aim of containing the National Army and supporting Chen Yi, but it has all been in vain.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 13th] The forces of Liu Bocheng in Southwestern Shandong are now disintegrating. The National Army from Shanxian, Yucheng, Caoxian, and Jinxiang encircled Chengwu on three routes today and advanced to the outskirts of the city this afternoon. The Communist forces in Chengwu and Dingtao are now completely encircled by the National Army, and the time of the Communist forces' destruction is imminent. The railway bridge on the Longhai Railway in Shanxi was bombed on the night of the 12th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] After fierce battles on the Longhai Railway, the main force of Liu Bocheng's forces near Minquan was annihilated, and the remnants scattered. The National Army advancing towards Linyi in Southern Shandong has advanced north to Lijiazhuang and is advancing rapidly.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 13th] After suffering setbacks in the area of Minquan and Ye'egang, the main force of the Communist forces under Liu Bocheng largely fled towards Caoxian on the night of the 12th. Liu himself and his 1st Column are still in the area east of the Liu River and Sunfuji, attempting to prevent the repair of the Longhai Railway in order to block the National Army from Shangqiu from advancing west. At present, powerful units of the National Army have arrived at Xiaoba, and the gap in the Longhai Railway has been closed again. Liu Bocheng's forces have apparently been cut into two sections, and it is possible that they will be defeated piecemeal.</p>

Last month, the National Army combined forces to encircle and suppress them. The Communist forces were unable to gain a foothold, so they fled southeast across the railway from the Zhanglanzhen area, both north and south. The National Army followed and pursued them, engaging in fierce battles at Huocun, Baojiadian, Dongxi Yangcun, Qiaotou, Nanbei Jiacun, Zhangyuancun, and Sentaicun (all northeast of Jiexiu city). The Communist forces suffered heavy losses and fled in all directions.</p>

<h3>US Personnel of the Military Mediation Department Can Be Completely Withdrawn Within Two Months; Rumor That US Military Advisory Group Will Set Up a Branch Group in Beiping is Incorrect</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Connors, a spokesperson for the US Embassy, told reporters today that the rumor that the US Military Advisory Group plans to set up a branch group in Beiping is incorrect. Most of the US personnel of the Military Mediation Department will be withdrawn completely within about 60 days, starting from mid-February. After the withdrawal of the US personnel, the Military Mediation Department will retain 25 officers and soldiers to be responsible for clearing up the remaining assets and managing the housing, etc. During this period, they will administratively belong to the US Military Advisory Group, but this does not mean that the US Military Advisory Group will set up a branch group in Beiping. The spokesperson also said that General Rooks, head of the US Military Advisory Group, is going to Beiping, or will discuss with the US authorities of the Military Mediation Department the matter of mutual transfer of personnel. General Rooks may transfer some personnel from the Military Mediation Department due to work needs, but this is only a mutual transfer in nature, and the personnel of the US Military Advisory Group will not increase. Some of the personnel currently holding positions in the US Military Advisory Group who have exceeded the three-year overseas service limit will be replaced by personnel from the Military Mediation Department.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] The tripartite personnel of the Military Mediation Department are busy withdrawing and ending their work. The government is working hard to take care of the withdrawal of the Communist and US parties, and to resettle all the staff. They are still working as usual every day. Today, more than 60 military police officers, transferred from Chongqing and other places when the Military Mediation Department was established last year, returned to the capital on three US planes of the Military Mediation Department. This is the first batch of personnel to return to the capital after the dissolution of the Military Mediation Department. Twenty officers transferred from the Northeast Headquarters and ten from the Beiping Headquarters will be transferred back to their original agencies. Chen Hu, director of the Government Mediation Office of the Military Mediation Department, will remain in Beiping to take up the new post of chief of staff of the Beiping Garrison Command. General Cai Wenzhi, the government's deputy commissioner, will only be able to return to the capital in mid-March, after the withdrawal of the Communist and US personnel.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] The Taiyuan (Third) and Linfen (Fourteenth) groups of the Military Mediation Department were picked up by US planes this afternoon and returned to Beiping. The Seventh and Thirteenth groups stationed in Jinan are scheduled to be withdrawn to Beiping tomorrow. Tang Chaoxian, a warrant officer from the government side of the department, and 15 others are also scheduled to return to the capital on a US plane tomorrow. Most of the Communist personnel have stopped working, and those who have withdrawn account for about a quarter of the total number. Today, one plane transported Communist supplies to Yan'an, and Wu Youbiao and more than ten others will be sent away tomorrow. The US withdrawal work in Harbin is the most active. Six US ships will come to Tanggu on the 17th, possibly carrying most of the personnel back to their country.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 13th] Zhang, the secretary of the Eleventh War Zone, said that the US withdrawal from Beiping and the dissolution of the Military Mediation Department will not affect the security of Beiping.

<h3>Our Surplus Salt Export Policy is Based on Production, Mainly to Take Care of Domestic Needs; Exports Will Be Made When There is a Surplus, and the Quantity is Not Limited</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Recently, the industrial sector has expressed concerns about whether China's surplus salt should be exported to Japan. This reporter has learned from relevant parties that since the victory, all salt-producing areas in China have been recovered. It is estimated that the annual production may reach a huge 160.6 million dan. Together with the original stock of about 48.8 million dan, the total is 154.4 million dan. In addition to supplying domestic sales, there is still a minimum surplus of 60 to 70 million [blank], which cannot be disposed of. Therefore, we have to try to reduce production on the one hand, gradually cutting down salt fields that are not economically viable, and at the same time seek a way out for the excess salt. The Allied Headquarters in Tokyo requested that our country's surplus salt be exported to Japan in exchange for materials. After careful consideration, the decision was made to accept it, for three reasons: (1) Exporting salt that has no use domestically to foreign countries not only provides a way out for surplus salt, but can also be exchanged for materials needed domestically, enriching national use; (2) Relieving salt farmers of economic hardship and unemployment, avoiding serious social problems; (3) Avoiding salt farmers from smuggling in large quantities, hindering tax revenue.</p>
<p>The total export quantity last year (1946) was 289,935.5 tons. This year, the initial export plan was formulated based on the salt inventory at the end of 1946, plus the possible surplus of new salt produced this year, totaling 785,000 tons for the whole year. The export is projected to be 376,000 tons for the first half of the year, from January to June. Considering the past export situation of our country, this number is not too far apart.</p>
<p>According to [blank] political authorities: We sincerely hope that the chemical industry in various countries will have considerable development, and can voluntarily make full use of the surplus salt, but at present, the industrial sector in fact cannot accept this surplus salt, so we have to allocate exports. This is really not an easy thing to do. The current export policy is based on taking care of our own country first, and then exporting when there is a surplus. The quantity is not limited. The amount of production and revenue this year is not as much as expected. At that time, we will allocate the quantity according to the supply and demand situation, and change the export plan. We will never let the export affect the domestic food demand.</p>
<p>Fujian Salt to be Shipped to Japan Within the Week</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 13th] Fujian salt has begun to be exported in large quantities. Last week, 20,000 dan were shipped to Shanghai. The 300,000 dan scheduled to be transported to Ji鄂 are also being shipped successively. The salt to be shipped to Japan is currently being loaded onto ships in Xiamen by the "Chongyang Maru," and 60,000 dan can be shipped within the week.</p>

<h3>UNRRA Rushes to Ship Supplies to China; The First Batch of Locomotives May Arrive in Kowloon Next Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] With UNRRA's relief work in Europe coming to an end, the relief work for China is also becoming intense. The United States is now shipping a large number of relief supplies to China. More than 100 ships are rushing to transport supplies to China, and from now on, an average of 12 ships per week will unload 36,000 tons of supplies at ports such as Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shantou, and Dagu.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] UNRRA has now shipped its first batch of 160 locomotives and coal water cars allocated to China. Forty-seven of them were loaded onto the Norwegian 10,000-ton merchant ship Bai Zhen on the 11th. The ship is expected to leave the United States on February 20 and is expected to arrive in Kowloon on March 15. These vehicles will be unloaded directly to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. Chen Zhimai, a counselor at the Chinese Embassy in the United States, said here that the departure of the vehicles to China is a significant event, as the Chinese government has always attached great importance to the supply of transportation tools. Rooks, the new director of UNRRA, said that UNRRA is very willing to help China revive its transportation. Half of UNRRA's plan to revive China's transportation is to revive China's railways, which includes allocating 242 locomotives, 3,000 freight cars, 400,000 tons of bridge materials, and 100 tons of rail materials, and all its ancillary equipment to China. The materials allocated to our country by UNRRA will be shipped to China successively at one-month intervals. After that, the materials will be unloaded in Shanghai instead of Kowloon. In addition to the 160 locomotives originally scheduled to be allocated to China, UNRRA is also manufacturing 50 locomotives in Australia and allocating them to China. This batch of locomotives is expected to be shipped to China in the summer of this year.</p>

<h3>Austrian Employee of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRCA) Killed in Tong County</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tianjin, 13th] Weisburg, an Austrian supervisor of the highway transportation team of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRCA), was traveling from Tong County to Ping on Tuesday afternoon at 4 p.m. with several UNRRA supply trucks. In a village 20 miles east of Tong County, they were stopped by four Chinese men: two wearing blue uniforms, one wearing a gray uniform, and one wearing plain clothes. The Chinese man in plain clothes ordered Weisburg to get out of his yellow truck. Weisburg, wearing an UNRRA uniform, raised his hands and obeyed the order to get out of the truck. The Chinese man in plain clothes, without saying a word, raised his gun and opened fire on him. Weisburg was shot and fell to the ground, rolling down a slope ten steps away, screaming miserably. The Chinese driver took the opportunity to escape and saw a soldier throw a hand grenade at Weisburg again. The Chinese driver finally arrived in Beiping. Later, another commercial truck passed the scene and saw Weisburg lying on the ground, his coat and shoes had been taken off. The truck did not dare to rescue him. It is reported that although the people who stopped the UNRRA truck team searched the truck, they did not take any items. They are not usually a gang of bandits.</p>

<h3>More Than 100,000 Refugees in Vietnam Awaiting Aid; Overseas Chinese Delegation Reports to Reporters in Beijing; Countless Deaths, Injuries, and Property Losses</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Luo Weiji, Zhou Shouyu, and other representatives of the Overseas Chinese Rehabilitation Committee in Vietnam, hosted a press conference at 10:00 a.m. on the 12th to report on the losses suffered by overseas Chinese and their experiences of being trapped during the French-Vietnamese conflict. Zhou Shouyu reported that when the French-Vietnamese war in Haiphong was taking place, the Viet Minh army used the shops and residences of our overseas Chinese as trenches, resisting house by house. The French army then launched a fierce attack on the Viet Minh army, causing heavy losses to our overseas Chinese compatriots. According to statistics, the total loss of houses and property is no less than 40 million Vietnamese currency. The number of missing people is 321 men and 261 women. The number of arrested people is 161 men and 37 women. The number of injured people is 39 men and 17 women. The number of deaths is 41 men and 26 women, totaling 902 people. About 1,000 people have not reported and their entire families have died or scattered. The numbers are really not small. When the peace negotiations in Haiphong failed on December 19th and the war in Vietnam broke out in full force, the war broke out successively in Lang Son, Hanoi, Nam Dinh, Kanghai, Beining, Beijiang, Thuan Hoa, Yian, Da Nang, and Xianan. The deaths and losses of overseas Chinese were even greater. At present, no less than 100,000 of our overseas Chinese compatriots are scattered in various parts of northern Vietnam. Those who are displaced and impoverished are everywhere. Now that the war is in full swing, there are still more than 10,000 overseas Chinese compatriots trapped in the overseas Chinese area controlled by the Viet Minh army in Hanoi. Food is [blank], there is no water at all, and they are sitting and waiting to die. Epidemics are occurring, and there are deaths from time to time. The Hanoi Chinese Association and the Chinese School are housing more than 3,800 refugees, crying for food. The Nading Guanghua School and the Nantian Hotel were bombed by the French army, killing and injuring more than 100 people. The shops and residences of overseas Chinese in Beining were completely destroyed by artillery fire. We hereby request the government to (1) demand compensation from both the French and Vietnamese sides for the losses of overseas Chinese; (2) take effective measures to protect overseas Chinese; and (3) send personnel with funds to provide relief. We hope that compatriots across the country will give spiritual and material assistance to the 100,000 refugees in northern Vietnam.</p>
<h3>Three Major Tasks Underway for Yellow River Mouth Closure and Embankment Restoration Relief: River Diversion expected to be Completed by End of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Through consultations among the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRCA), Water Conservancy Commission and the Chinese Communist Party, it appears that opinions have become slightly closer regarding the solution to the Yellow River problem. The implementation of the three major tasks of mouth closure, embankment restoration and relief is now agreed upon by the four parties to proceed simultaneously and separately. The Yellow River has ice floods in the second spring, and peach floods in April. According to forecasts, if the project is expedited, there will be no disaster, but there will be a large flood in July this summer. If the mouth closure project cannot be completed before July, the flooding is worrying, and it will be out of control once it starts. Therefore, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRCA), Water Conservancy Commission and the Chinese Communist Party have all agreed to expedite the Yellow River project. As for the funds for relieving the refugees in the disaster area, they will be allocated by the government.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 12th] The Huayuankou mouth closure project has been extremely smooth in the past week. It has been decided to open three more river diversion channels, which have already begun construction. It is estimated that the channels will be joined by the end of March. The entire volume of the Yellow River water will arrive in Shandong Province in mid-April. At present, most of the embankment restoration project in the Guojun [blank] area of Shandong Province has been completed. All the dangerous works and repairs below the middle and foreign positions have been completed. The work of repairing the parts above the middle water level is now continuing.</p>
<h3>Major Fire in Fuzhou Destroys Over a Hundred Houses</h3>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 13th] At 2:00 AM this morning, a major fire broke out in Xiaozhou, Fuzhou, burning down 125 houses, totaling 221 households, leaving thousands homeless. The cause of the fire was due to carelessness with incense during a religious ceremony at the Yangfa Tea Company. The area is a trade hub for local Fuzhou products, and the losses are catastrophic, currently impossible to estimate. Several firefighters were seriously injured due to their courageous demolition of buildings to control the blaze.</p>
<h3>Industrial Machinery Removed from the Northeast Valued at $900 Million USD; Inoperable Factory Equipment Estimated at Around $2 Billion USD</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 13th] American Reparations Commissioner Edwin W. Pauley reiterated today regarding the "industrial machinery removed by the Soviet Union from the Northeast," stating: The utility of the machinery after it was transported to the Soviet Union is minimal, but if it had been left for China, it would have been of great value.</p>
<p>Pauley stated: He is certain that the value of the machinery removed by the Soviet Union is $900 million USD, but the factory equipment rendered inoperable due to the removal is estimated to be around $2 billion USD. Therefore, the Soviet side's claim that the value of the machinery they removed is $1 billion USD is not unreasonable.</p>
<p>American Government Invites Various Countries to Discuss Japanese Reparations Issues</p>

The British government has accepted the invitation, but when the discussions will begin and what form they will take are currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Original Text of the Judgment Reasons Against Traitor Ding Mocun</h3>
<p>— Continued to completion</p>
<p>Opportunistic Maneuvering</p>
<p>Regarding the favorable facts presented by the defendant, there are four categories: (1) Voluntary Surrender: The defendant claims that in the spring of the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], he entrusted someone to surrender to the central government, demonstrating his remorse and intent to perform meritorious service. However, the defendant was already wanted by the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office as of October 2, 1939. He did not voluntarily surrender for trial before the crime was discovered. Therefore, he clearly does not meet the conditions for voluntary surrender stipulated in Article 62 of the Criminal Code, nor does he meet the primary requirements for voluntary surrender stipulated in Article 1 of the regulations on traitors surrendering. The defendant's claim of voluntary surrender is therefore not worthy of discussion. (2) Assisting the War of Resistance: The defendant claims that after surrendering, he set up a concealed radio station, secretly reported enemy intelligence, opposed "Clearance Campaigns," opposed participation in the war, sowed discord between the enemy and Wang [Jingwei], sabotaged Li Shiqun and "76," spread pro-war sentiment, sabotaged the enemy's plundering of resources, organized the Zhengfeng Society, absorbed remorseful elements, used strategies to persuade enemy troops to withdraw, requested changes to ciphers, revoked the Zhejiang blockade line, controlled puppet troops to prepare for reaction, rescued underground workers of the central government, suggested a general amnesty to release political prisoners already sentenced, and developed party affairs and culture in the occupied areas. After investigation of the evidence provided by the defendant, those deemed necessary to investigate have been carefully reviewed, such as the concealed radio station, organizing the Zhengfeng Society, providing intelligence, and rescuing underground workers. There is a confidential letter No. 81 from the Organization Department of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party dated December 10, 1946, letters from Jiang Bocheng and Wu Kaixian dated December 9 and 4 of the same year, and case files sent by the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the former Military Affairs Commission, which can be used to determine their authenticity. However, although the defendant performed minor services, his crimes are heinous. Weighing the pros and cons, it is not enough to compensate for his crimes even in the slightest. Furthermore, according to the transfer documents from the former Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, in August 1943, the bureau approved the use of a radio station set up in Ding's private residence to communicate with us formally, but this matter was known to the enemy, who deliberately did not destroy it, wanting to use it as a so-called "bridge of peace" with our central government. It can be determined that this was not a sincere voluntary surrender (see page 36 of the bureau's files). The defendant's use of assisting the War of Resistance for opportunistic maneuvering is obvious and not sufficient for sentencing consideration.</p>
<p>Petty Favors</p>
<p>(3) Striving for the Welfare of the People in the Occupied Areas: The defendant claims that he founded the Social Enterprise Association and the Rural Welfare Association in his private capacity, establishing welfare enterprises in various places. The expenses were privately raised and donated by the defendant, alleviating the suffering of the people and preserving the vitality of the country. A list of the enterprises he operated is on file. The social enterprises operated by the defendant were mostly the responsibilities of the pseudo-Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Social Welfare. The defendant held pseudo-official positions as minister of these ministries for many years. Even if the listed enterprises are genuine, they are the obligations that he should have fulfilled in his pseudo-official position and are difficult to consider as actions beneficial to the people. Furthermore, reviewing the list of enterprises operated, they are merely petty favors, used to win over people's hearts so that they would be driven by the enemy and puppets, and are difficult to use as a reason for reducing the sentence. (4) Assisting in the Surrender and Preserving Local Areas: The defendant claims that after the victory, he was ordered to assist the central government in accepting the surrender, acting as a liaison with the enemy's commander-in-chief, and also acting as a liaison for the surrender of the Zhejiang puppet troops to the Third War Area. He also assisted the Third War Area in receiving enemy military equipment, materials, and defensive positions. He was previously appointed as a military commissioner of the Zhejiang region of the former Military Affairs Commission, maintaining security in Zhejiang. Later, he handed over all the puppet military security teams, which were received by the central government, with no one or a single gun lost. The defendant's assistance in the surrender and preservation of local areas is proven to be true by a confidential letter No. 11 from the Army General Headquarters dated October 30, 1946. However, these actions all occurred after the victory and do not meet the conditions of "having assisted the War of Resistance and taken actions beneficial to the people" stipulated in Article 3 of the Regulations on Handling Traitor Cases, and cannot be used as a basis for reducing the sentence. Even if his attitude after the crime was slightly constructive, it was merely because he was at his wit's end and had no choice but to submit. It is difficult to adopt this as a standard for discretionary sentencing.</p>
<p>Unforgivable by Law</p>
<p>The defendant, having received higher education and held important positions in the central government, deserted his post to participate in the war at a time of deep enemy incursions and critical war conditions, abandoned the anti-Japanese camp, secretly communicated with the enemy, willingly joined the rebellion, ambushed central judicial personnel, harmed underground working comrades, and published pro-Japanese fallacies, confusing public opinion, exploiting people's wealth, and supplying the enemy. His crimes are so obvious that he is truly unforgivable by law. He should be sentenced to the maximum penalty, deprived of his civil rights for life, to uphold the national law and rectify the hearts of the people. All of his property, except for a reasonable amount reserved for the necessary living expenses of his family, should be confiscated. Based on the above arguments, the special criminal procedure law Article 291, the first article of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, Article 2, paragraph 1, item 1, Article 8, paragraph 1, Article 9, the first paragraph of Article 2 of the Criminal Code, Article 28, and Article 37, paragraph 1, are used to render the judgment as stated in the main text. Prosecutor Chen Sheng served as prosecutor in this case. February 8, 1947, First Criminal Division of the Capital High Court, Presiding Judge Jin Shiding, Judge Ge Zhaotang, Judge Shentu Chen.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How Should We Deal with the Current Economic Difficulties?</h3>
<p>The recent surge in gold and banknotes that swept across major cities nationwide has subsided due to the government's strict measures. However, the root causes of China's economic crisis remain and could reemerge at any time. This is a current concern not only for the entire nation but also for friendly nations. If we do not find a way to stem the tide before it collapses, future financial turmoil will be endless and will intensify. Now that this turmoil has subsided, and after painful reflection, we feel the government must quickly re-establish a new economic policy. During the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 12th, the members unanimously agreed that the current economic policy needs to be re-evaluated. Therefore, they decided to establish an economic policy research committee, composed of Central Committee members, prominent figures from industry and commerce, and economic experts, to be responsible for researching economic policy. This proves that the government also believes that the current economic policy needs to be changed.</p>
<p>China's internal problems have become increasingly complex and are no longer a single, simple issue. The New York Times wrote on the 12th, commenting on the situation in China, "China's financial crisis is the root of China's political problems." Therefore, it advocates starting with rescuing the financial crisis to seek a solution to political problems. This view seems reasonable on the surface, but in reality, it is not entirely accurate and reverses cause and effect. The real reason for China's financial crisis is not inflation or the "government's declining popularity," but the unresolved issue of the Communist Party. China is a country that lags behind in every aspect. After eight years of arduous war, the loss of human and material resources, even calculated in astronomical figures, is not enough to represent the one-ten-thousandth of the losses our country has suffered. Moreover, after the victory of the War of Resistance, without time to recuperate, it suffered from the destruction and devastation of the Chinese Communist Party. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, there has never been a day of peace in the country, and restoration cannot even be discussed. How can we talk about revival! Therefore, as long as the problem of the Chinese Communist Party is not resolved, there is no possibility of eliminating China's financial crisis.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party not only holds a gloating attitude towards this surge in gold and banknotes, with a feeling of "watching the fire from across the river, clapping and cheering," but also feels complacent, believing that the great success of the Chinese Communist Party's disruption of financial policy is about to achieve their goal of "total collapse," which they have been hoping for day and night. This newspaper pointed out the political factors in the financial turmoil long ago. Judging from the statement issued by Special Envoy Marshall when he left China to return to the United States to take office as Secretary of State, Marshall frankly pointed out in his statement the Chinese Communist Party's conspiracy to use war to promote the domestic economic collapse, thereby achieving its goal of seizing power. It can be seen that as long as the internal turmoil does not stop for a day, China's economy has no possibility of improving for a day. I remember that in late last month, giants in Shanghai's industry, commerce, culture, and education circles, in view of the difficult domestic economic situation, also issued a call for peace, demanding an immediate ceasefire on the spot. In their declaration, there were several painful and heartbreaking words: "The people of the whole country are about to starve to death. Due to the war, thousands and thousands of compatriots continue to be abandoned in ditches and gullies. Due to the war, transportation is blocked, currency continues to inflate, people are unemployed, and industry and commerce are bankrupt. Therefore, we cannot but painfully issue a call from our conscience, demanding an end to the war and demanding the restoration of peace." However, the Chinese Communist Party, upon hearing the painful cries of the people, not only did not feel the slightest sympathy but instead felt complacent, celebrating the great success of its disruptive policies. Therefore, not only can the internal turmoil not be stopped, but it can only be expanded. Then, the Chinese Communist Party intensified its offensives in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu, making the people even more tearless.</p>
<p>With the Chinese Communist Party doing its best to destroy it, how can China's economy embark on the road to revival? However, we believe that the Chinese nation is a great and strong nation, with an unshakable belief in "human determination overcoming heaven." The more difficult the environment, the more the people know how to struggle arduously. As long as the government has good policies, a major determination, and a systematic plan, any economic difficulties can be overcome one by one. Therefore, when the government re-discusses economic policy, we are willing to put forward several opinions for the reference of the people of the country.</p>
<p>First, we believe that internal turmoil is the only root cause of economic difficulties, which is the main cause of financial turmoil. We, the ordinary people, are the masters of the country and cannot allow the Chinese Communist Party to arbitrarily manipulate the fate of the country and our own destiny. We should all stand up and strive for peace for the nation, the country, and ourselves. Although individual strength is limited, everyone should participate in the peace movement initiated by the Shanghai business community. This peace movement will generate strength. No matter how dictatorial the Chinese Communist Party is, turning a deaf ear to the cries of the people, public opinion cannot be insulted, and the Chinese Communist Party will ultimately have to be cautious! If the Chinese Communist Party insists on going its own way, then the so-called "the unjust have little support," which is tantamount to cutting themselves off from the people, and doing many unjust acts will inevitably lead to their own destruction. Therefore, after this turmoil, we, the ordinary people, should rise up to strive for peace and seek a way to save ourselves.</p>
<p>Second, to save the economic difficulties, it is necessary to have good policies, but stopping at policies alone will not be effective. We observe the common problem in today's Chinese politics, which lies in "no statistics" and "no plan." Taking this gold and banknote turmoil as an example, the insane speculators, disregarding the lives and deaths of the people, only seek personal gain and push up the price of gold and banknotes, which is the main cause of this turmoil. However, the financial authorities' lack of planning and lack of statistics is also one of the reasons for fueling the turmoil. Because before and after the Lunar New Year, issuing huge amounts of customs gold is tantamount to giving speculators a good opportunity to take advantage of the reason for currency inflation to stir up trouble in the market. This is something that everyone can anticipate. However, the financial authorities were unprepared beforehand, and after the turmoil occurred, they were at a loss, allowing it to spread and expand, so that the market became crazy and even more out of control. Later, strict measures were taken, which could suppress the rising price of gold and banknotes, but it is very difficult to suppress the prices of goods that rose in response. We assume that the financial authorities have accurate statistics, understand the details of the Shanghai market, and fight against the speculators who are pushing up the price of gold with the strength of the national treasury. We do not believe that this gold and banknote turmoil could not have been avoided. Learning from the past is a guide for the future. We hope that the financial authorities can accept this lesson, change their past practices, and have a plan for everything and statistics for everything. The effectiveness of France in suppressing prices and the success of the British rationing system rely on the authorities in charge having statistics, plans, and determination.</p>
<p>Third, according to a United Press Nanjing dispatch, the government's basis for resolving domestic economic difficulties within three months is entirely based on American surplus materials and Japanese reparations. We do not believe that the agency's dispatch is correct, but there are also some people in the country who hold this dependent mentality. We believe that this dependency is the most terrible thing and must point out that this is definitely not the way out for China's economy. The way to manage finances is nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. In terms of increasing revenue, the first is to increase production, facilitate transportation, and promote industry and commerce. In terms of reducing expenditure, not only should the government save on government expenses, but also the people should tighten their belts and reduce their consumption. The current difficult situation is caused by the fact that domestic production is small and consumption is large, which led to this situation.</p>
<p>In short, the current economic policy needs to be re-evaluated. At the same time, in order to cope with the current economic difficulties, the government should have plans, statistics, and determination in handling anything. As for the people of the whole country, at this time when the domestic economic difficulties are most serious, they should tighten their belts and reduce their consumption, and work together to overcome the difficulties.</p>

<h3>Mudu Grain Hoarding Case Involves the Field Grain Sub-Bureau; Rice Merchants to be Summoned Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 13th] In the Mudu rice merchants' grain hoarding case, the county military law office has summoned the responsible persons of each rice shop to report to the authorities for interrogation on the 15th. The director of the Mudu Field Grain Sub-Bureau, Dong Yixian, suddenly submitted his resignation, which was not approved. Our reporter specially visited County Chief Shen again, who said that the current investigation work can be divided into two steps: (1) According to the rice shops, part of the grain stored under seal is deposited by the Field Grain Sub-Bureau. Therefore, it is necessary to first investigate why the grain tax collected by the Field Grain Sub-Bureau was not turned over to the warehouse but stored in commercial rice shops. (2) The amount of grain hoarded by the rice merchants will be converted into dan and shi by measuring the volume and checking the accounts to see if there is any discrepancy. As for the handling of this case, the decision on the hoarded grain is to sell it at a fair price in principle.</p>

<h3>Yixing to Huzhou Commuter Train</h3>
<p>[Our Yixing Dispatch] In order to facilitate travel, the First Transportation Office directly under the Highway Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has launched a reserved seat commuter train from Yixing to Wuxing starting from the 10th of this month. Passengers can get on and off at Tangdu, Jiapu, Changxing, and other stations along the way. The schedule is temporarily set at one round trip per day.

<h3>Driver Disregards Passenger Safety; Rugao-Nantong Highway Truck Falls into River; Company Ignores Casualties; Stranded Passengers Appeal</h3>
<p>[Nantong Dispatch] On the morning of January 31, a ten-wheeled truck No. 10 of the Nantong Northern Jiangsu Water and Land Joint Company, carrying more than ten passengers including Chu Long, and more than thirty pigs, drove from Rugao to Nantong. At Yangzhuang between Shizhuang and Guojiayuan, Li Zhaonan and eight others and several other passengers boarded the truck. When it reached Pingchao, it was already sunset. The passengers initially assumed that the truck would drive directly to Nantong, but when it reached the fork between Tangjia Gate and Chenggang, the passengers wanted to go to Nantong first, but the driver did not listen, did not stop, and drove directly to Tianshenggang. It arrived at the port at 7:00 PM and began unloading the pigs. The driver immediately notified Chu Long to extort 25,000 yuan per passenger from Li Zhaonan and the others: (According to the price of a ticket from Rugao to Tong on that day, the price per passenger was only 20,000 yuan). After a delay of about half an hour, the passengers were able to board the truck. After turning around at the gate, the truck started driving. The headlights could not illuminate. In a moment, at the eastern turn of the Zesheng Sluice Company, it veered and plunged into the water (according to the turn, the surface is twice as wide as the highway). The water was so deep that the truck could not be seen. Residents and police rushed to rescue. Yao Naiwen, Li Zhaonan, and Li Yaochen died despite rescue efforts. Nearly twenty other people were rescued and resuscitated. Two more bodies, Chu Long and Kong Cai, were recovered the next day. Looking at the above situation, the fact that the truck's headlights could not illuminate was the cause of the accident. However, the fact that the truck only cared about sending the pigs to Tianshenggang first, regardless of the safety of more than twenty passengers to Nantong, and drove directly to Tianshenggang without stopping at Tangzha in order to carry out its conspiracy to extort fares, is even more important to ignore. After the accident, the company only cared about salvaging its truck and continued to operate as usual, without asking about the dead, injured, or those who suffered losses. This is even more disheartening. The stranded passengers have now organized a union to discuss countermeasures and appeal for support from all sectors.</p>
<h3>Chongming Rent Dispute; Landlords Extorting Rice</h3>
<p>[Our Chongming Dispatch] In this county, rents were changed to be paid in rice during the occupied period due to the drastic depreciation of currency. Recently, some landlords in fort towns have attempted to increase the rent rice. For a flat of less than fifty square feet, they are demanding about five dou of rice per month. If the tenants do not agree, they falsely claim that they are for their own use and order them to move out. Hundreds of tenants in the whole town are unable to bear such extortion by the landlords at a time when rice prices are soaring and all industries are in recession. They have organized a tenant union, preparing to rely on the Provincial Rent Relief Measures promulgated last autumn and citing the Minhang Rent Resolution Method disclosed by this newspaper on January 30 to negotiate with the landlords to reach a reasonable solution.</p>

<h3>Reorganizing Changxing Coal Mine, Zhejiang Construction Department Plans to Request Central Government Investment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 13th] Zhejiang Province plans to establish brick and tile factories in Jiaxing. Each factory can accommodate 300 kilns. Developing the Changxing Coal Mine for fuel has become a priority. It is suggested that Pi Yingchang, due to disagreements among the old and new shareholders of the mine, has delayed its handling until now, so the Zhejiang General Office also cannot assist. Therefore, it is proposed to request investment from relevant central government agencies to invest as government shares and find ways to develop the mine.</p>
<h3>Changshu Executes Two Notorious Bandits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changshu News] Chen He and Zhou Xiangfu, notorious bandits from the southern countryside, specialized in colluding to rob vehicles and committed numerous crimes.

<h3>Pinghu Reorganizes Land Registry, Urging Residents to Register Door-to-Door</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Pinghu News] The County Land Registry Reorganization Office has been handling land registration in urban areas, Donghu, Shengtang, and Qiyuan townships for several months. However, the office recognizes that most landowners are unaware of the significance and are taking a wait-and-see approach. According to Article 57 of the Land Law, those who have not applied for registration after the deadline for general land registration should be considered unclaimed land and publicly announced. This is a serious matter concerning the gain or loss of people's property rights. To safeguard the rights of landowners, the office has dispatched personnel to urge residents to register door-to-door.</p>

<h3>Do Not Stereotype Firefighters</h3>
<p>Regarding the major fire on Wuding Road on the night of January 22nd, opinions are divided and no consensus has been reached. Some say that firefighters extorted gold bars and haggled over prices, some say that firefighters stood by and watched without rescuing, some say that firefighters took advantage of the fire to loot and steal property, and some say that all firefighters were derelict in their duties, attacking indiscriminately and blurring the lines, affecting the entire fire service. This is truly not a minor matter. The fire service is a public organization that protects the safety of citizens, so criticism should separate the matter from the person. Even if a few individuals are bad, the principle should be to avoid harming the entire reputation and career. Crimes can be handled by law, and dereliction of duty can be replaced, but the entire city of Shanghai cannot guarantee that there will be no fires for a day, and there cannot be a day without firefighters to put out fires. It can be seen that the fire service cannot be abandoned for a day. In order for firefighters to be loyal to their duties, all citizens should cherish and encourage them. Unexpectedly, in this Wuding Road fire case, a few people nitpicked and attacked excessively, causing the entire organization to lose morale and all firefighters to become disheartened. This is a loss for society, not just a problem for a few individuals. Now, the minds of all citizens are suspicious that firefighters are petty thieves who steal property. If this continues, not only will firefighters on duty be unwilling to do work that has a bad reputation and is looked down upon, but everyone will be preparing to pack their bags. Even future firefighters will probably not be willing to take over the work of being regarded as thieves.</p>
<p>In the current stage, the work of firefighters is indeed very difficult. Every time they put out a fire, entering the burning building makes them suspected of theft, and not entering the burning building will result in disciplinary action for dereliction of duty. In this way, firefighters feel that they are in a dilemma and cannot perform their duties. I believe that if firefighters do have illegal behavior, they should be severely punished to rectify the evil trend, but it must be based on facts. Empty words should not be used to accuse people, and people should not be wrongly accused. It is unacceptable to call a deer a horse and implicate the innocent, causing all firefighters to feel chilled.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the issue of responsibility, the firefighter's responsibility is to put out the fire. Watching over the property of disaster victims is not their responsibility. The loss of disaster victims is one thing, and whether firefighters have stolen is another. If the loss of disaster victims is attributed to the firefighters, it would be too harsh.</p>
<p>As for the government's handling of the Wuding Road fire case, it can be said to be cautious and deliberate. The five-person investigation committee is also very detailed and strict in its investigation work. All those who entered the burning building have been transferred to the prosecutor's office for interrogation (see the investigation report). Since the authorities are determined to get to the bottom of this case and are willing to sacrifice their subordinates to gain the sympathy of society, more than 20 officials and police officers who entered the burning building, whether they were acting in the public or private interest, may be summoned or detained at any time, regardless of whether they were at fault or not. I hope that the disaster victims will have a clear conscience and quickly provide clear evidence and do not be ambiguous any more. If firefighters know of any misconduct, they should voluntarily report it so that the scum can be removed and the good can be protected. It is hoped that the law enforcement authorities will determine right from wrong and not involve the innocent. (Xiao Leyou)</p>
<h3>Please Dispose of Corpse of Child by Roadside Quickly</h3>
<p>It has been found that there are several corpses (all children) wrapped in firewood piled by the roadside near Lake Hui Villa on Lvbanc Road in the Nanshi area. They have been left there for more than a month without being handled and are left to rot. At a time when smallpox is rampant in the city, these corpses may have died from smallpox or variola. The foul odor is steaming and there is a risk of infection. It is hoped that the authorities will dispose of them quickly. (Questioning Voice)</p>
<h3>Many Items for Fees Collected by Municipal Schools</h3>
<p>I am a student at the Zhenru Municipal Middle School. On the 8th, I received a payment notice from the school, which left me stunned. There was a long list of items: tuition fees of 20,000 yuan for junior high school and 30,000 yuan for senior high school. Supplementary repair and replacement fees of 20,000 yuan for junior high school and 30,000 yuan for senior high school. Miscellaneous fees of 10,000 yuan, a compensation reserve of 5,000 yuan "temporarily collected." A subsidy fee of 60,000 yuan for academic advancement of teachers and staff, accommodation fee of 60,000 yuan, and food fee of 250,000 yuan. The most humorous of these items is the subsidy fee for academic advancement of teachers and staff. How is this different from a private school? The purpose of our applying to a municipal school is to save costs and reduce the burden on our families. Most of our parents are salary earners. This fee is not easy to pay. Especially for civil servants, who are known for being upright and poor, the same is true. If they have many children, where will they get the money for education? In the end, the only option is to withdraw from school with tears. Who has ruined our future? (Small Place, Big Issues)</p>

<h3>US and Canada Establish Military Agreement, Continuing Cooperation to Implement Peacetime Joint Defense</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 13th Broadcast: The United States and Canada announced today that the two countries will continue their wartime military cooperation in peacetime to ensure the security of North America.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The United States and Canada announced simultaneously today that the two countries have concluded a five-point military agreement to "encourage" standardization of equipment, training, and tactics, and to allow mutual use of army, navy, and air force facilities. The US State Department also stated that the military agreement concluded between the US and Canada and the exploratory talks held between the US and Britain on the same issue are two completely different matters. A State Department spokesman also said that the US-Canada agreement is a "document of understanding."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Ottawa, 12th] Canadian Prime Minister King stated in the House of Commons today that the United States has not requested military bases in northern Canada, and announced the following principles for the continuation of wartime cooperation between the United States and Canada in peacetime:</p>
<p>Six Principles, Mutual Understanding</p>
<p>(1) Exchange selected personnel to familiarize them with the national defense of both countries. (2) Engage in general cooperation in exercises, experiments, and research on matters of common interest to both countries, and exchange observers. (3) Encourage the joint design and standardization of weapons equipment, military organization, training methods, etc. (4) Mutual use of naval and air force facilities within the borders of both countries. (5) The cooperation between the two countries shall be based on the principle that it does not harm the control of each country over all activities within its own borders. Prime Minister King also said that the Arctic region is the shortest transportation line between North America and other major centers in the world, so its status has become increasingly important. For this reason, we must pay special attention to these regions. In other words, when considering Canada's defense, we should consider not only the east and west ends but also the north end. Prime Minister King finally stated that the United States and Canada will never take actions that are inconsistent with the UN Charter.</p>
<p>[United Press, Ottawa, 13th] Canada's announcement that the wartime defense cooperation agreement with the United States will continue in peacetime is a major step for the Dominion to gradually transition from the British Commonwealth to the North American sphere.</p>
<h3>Security Council Passes Resolution to Establish Disarmament Committee, Delineate Powers with Atomic Energy Committee, Draft Disarmament Resolution Pending Vote</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 13th Broadcast: The UN Security Council today passed a resolution by a vote of nine to zero to form a special committee to study various disarmament issues, except for those that have been discussed by the UN Atomic Energy Commission.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, New York, 12th] The UN Security Council passed a resolution this afternoon following the guidelines suggested by the United States to organize a UN Disarmament Committee composed of representatives from eleven countries, with the opposition of the Soviet Union being ineffective. The Disarmament Committee is limited to discussing the abolition of conventional weapons. All "weapons of mass destruction" will be handled by the established UN Atomic Energy Commission. The Security Council passed this proposal today by a vote of nine to zero, with the Soviet Union and Poland abstaining. No country opposed the Disarmament Committee itself, but the Soviet Union has consistently opposed distinctions in power when discussing disarmament issues and has been constantly arguing with the United States, thus delaying the discussion of disarmament issues for six weeks. As for the draft disarmament resolution submitted by the UN General Assembly to the Security Council for discussion, it is still pending a vote by the Security Council. The Security Council will now have to deal with the issue of the use of veto power by the five permanent members. If the Security Council believes that this matter is a matter of principle rather than procedure, the draft disarmament resolution may be "vetoed." However, representatives from Britain and the United States believe that Soviet representative Gromyko will not veto the disarmament plan simply because of his opposition to the distinction in power. According to today's resolution, the Security Council should establish a universal disarmament committee, composed of representatives from the eleven countries of the Security Council, including the five permanent members. The Disarmament Committee should submit to the Security Council recommendations for universal reduction of armaments and troops within three months, and effective guarantees to protect peace-loving countries from illegal military attacks. Today's resolution also stipulates that the Security Council should begin discussing the atomic energy issue raised by the Atomic Energy Commission as soon as possible. Representatives are scheduled to reconvene tomorrow at 3 p.m. to vote on the draft disarmament resolution.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 12th] British representative Cadogan advised the Soviet Union during the disarmament debate in the Security Council today not to hinder the Security Council's Military Staff Committee any longer, so that the agreement on the UN motorcade issue discussed by the committee could be established quickly. Cadogan further suggested ordering the Military Staff Committee to submit a complete report by April 30. Cadogan also supported the US proposal, believing that the Disarmament Committee cannot interfere with the tasks of the Atomic Energy Commission. He also asked Soviet representative Gromyko whether the Soviet Union's opposition to this proposal was merely a formality, and if so, asked him to withdraw this opposition so that the Disarmament Committee could be appointed quickly. Representatives from France and Brazil also supported the US proposal.</p>
<h3>Einstein Supports Atomic Control</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Princeton, New Jersey, USA, 12th] The great mathematician Einstein wrote to the Atomic Problem Research Association today, strongly urging the public to expand their awareness of the dangers of atomic warfare. He said, "Atomic energy has no place in the outdated narrow concept of nationalism, because atomic bombs cannot be defended. The only possible control is international understanding."</p>
<h3>Britain Assures US of Maintaining Close Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Authoritative sources say that British Ambassador to the United States Lord Inverchapel has assured Secretary of State Marshall that the British government continues to advocate close cooperation with the United States as the basis for world peace and security. It has recently been rumored that British Foreign Secretary Bevin may become pro-Soviet due to pressure from left-wing members of the party, so both the public and private sectors in the United States feel unusually uneasy. The exchange of views between the British ambassador and Marshall is therefore highly valued by the general public.</p>
<h3>US Representative Selection Issue for UN Atomic Energy Commission</h3>
<p>Many Oppose Lilienthal</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Lilienthal, appointed by President Truman as the US representative to the UN Atomic Energy Commission, has been criticized by the Senate committee investigating his resume. Extreme conservatives from the Republican Party and Democrats from the southern states have formed a united front to oppose him. Lilienthal has been accused of appeasing communism, and this issue has clearly become a major domestic political issue in the United States.</p>
<h3>Britain Recognizes Bulgarian Government, Hopes It Will Fulfill Treaty Obligations and Enjoy Rights</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] After signing a peace treaty with Bulgaria in Paris on Monday, Britain formally sent a note to the Bulgarian government, stating that the British government has decided to legally recognize the Bulgarian government. The note also stated the following: Although the British government recognizes the Bulgarian government, it continues to maintain its previous attitude that Britain believes that the Bulgarian interim government has failed to fulfill its promises to implement democratic rights. This recognition of the new Bulgarian government does not indicate that Britain recognizes that the methods used by the Bulgarian government in the election are consistent with the spirit and intent of the Yalta Declaration. The British government now feels that since Bulgaria has accepted the obligations stipulated in the peace treaty, it recognizes the Bulgarian government and hopes that it will fulfill its promises in the future so that all people under the jurisdiction of the government can enjoy basic rights. The Bulgarian government's reply, signed by Prime Minister Dimitrov, expressed satisfaction with the British government's formal recognition of the Bulgarian government and promised to fulfill the conditions of the peace treaty. However, it expressed disagreement with the points mentioned in the British note regarding the methods used by the Bulgarian government during the election.</p>
<h3>Treaty with Germany, Discussion Procedure, Adopts British and Soviet Drafts</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] The Council of Foreign Ministers met this afternoon.

The proposal put forward by France to establish an intelligence and consultation committee among the Allied countries is also included in the drafts submitted by Britain and the Soviet Union. In addition, the Council of Foreign Ministers decided to submit the notes sent by the governments of Italy and Syria requesting permission to send representatives to attend the meeting and state their opinions on the treaty with Germany to the Council of Foreign Ministers.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London, 13th Broadcast: When the Council of Foreign Ministers discussed the US proposal to set up a small-nation consultation committee, Soviet Foreign Minister Gusev announced that he would abandon his previous position in the four-power meeting and agreed to allow 18 small nations to participate in the drafting of the treaty with Germany.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 12th] The Egyptian government announced to the House of Representatives today that the government believes that the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 is invalid and will notify the United Nations organization of this matter.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Cairo, 13th] Former Egyptian Prime Minister El-Nokrashy suggested yesterday to resume the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations that had broken down last month and asked Saudi Arabian King Ibn Saud to mediate, but this was rejected by the committee appointed by the parliament to study the matter.

<h3>American Military Leaders Protest Military Spending Cuts</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, December 12] Secretary of the Army Patterson informed Congress today that Chief of Staff Eisenhower and Supreme Commander of the Pacific Area MacArthur had told him that if the Republican Party intends to cut military spending, it will inevitably lead to unfortunate consequences. According to the budget proposal submitted by President Truman for this year, the Budget Committees of both houses voted yesterday to cut six billion US dollars, of which military spending was cut by one and a half billion US dollars. Some Republican members also expressed dissatisfaction with this, and government leaders unanimously denounced it, saying that the result of the budget cuts would undermine the US Army and Navy and leave the State Department without any support in negotiating a peace treaty with Germany. Patterson then spoke, saying that this move would put the occupying forces stationed in Germany and Japan in a dangerous situation in the event of a rebellion, as Germany and Japan might revolt if they are forced into famine. Patterson also said that in terms of the tasks completed by the occupying forces, the current funding and number of personnel have reached the minimum limit. It is also learned that at a closed-door meeting held by the House Military Affairs Committee today, several senior officials of the War Department proposed that if Congress passes universal military training, the War Department could agree to reduce the number of regular troops from 1.07 million to 875,000. Patterson and his staff also told the Military Affairs Committee that the War Department would also take into account the issue of being able to mobilize 68,000 National Guardsmen and 195,000 reservists in an emergency, and that with the continued implementation of the conscription plan, there would be a total of 5.5 million troops to deal with any contingencies.</p>
<h3>British Military Spending Increase</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, December 13 (Broadcast): The British government today increased the army and navy expenditure up to March 1947 by 280 million yuan. Thus, the total expenditure for the army and navy this year has reached 4.028 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Coalition Cabinet Plan: Five Political Parties in Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, December 13] The meeting of the five Japanese parties adjourned this afternoon without reaching any resolution. Therefore, the question of whether the future Japanese cabinet will accommodate the Social Democratic Party and other smaller parties still needs to be decided tomorrow. After two hours of discussion, although the Social Democratic Party insisted on the resignation of Finance Minister Tanzan Ishibashi, forming a superficial deadlock, negotiations on a coalition government have made great progress. It is reported that the meeting held this afternoon by the Liberal Party, the Progressive Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Cooperative Democratic Party, and the People's Party did not reach an agreement because the representatives of each party had to consult their respective party members before making a final decision. However, all parties have agreed to convene a second five-party meeting at 2 p.m. tomorrow after the opening ceremony of the parliament.</p>
<p>[Kaizosha, Tokyo, December 13] The plan to form a coalition cabinet centered on the Liberal, Progressive, and Social Democratic parties failed for the third time on the eve of the parliament's resumption. Finance Minister Ishibashi, Minister of Health Kawai, and Secretary-General of the Socialist Party Nishio and Mizutani from the Central Committee held talks this morning, followed by a meeting of the secretaries-general of the Liberal, Progressive, and Social Democratic parties in the afternoon, and then a meeting of the leaders of the Liberal, Progressive, Social Democratic, Cooperative Democratic, and People's parties. After several rounds of consultation on the formation of a coalition cabinet, the Social Democratic Party insisted on replacing Finance Minister Ishibashi, while the Liberal and Progressive parties opposed the replacement. As opinions could not be reconciled, the meeting ended without any results. The Social Democratic Party convened a central executive committee at 6 p.m. and decided to abandon the coalition efforts. Other parties also expressed pessimism about the coalition efforts.</p>
<p>Parliament Resumes Today</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, December 13] The 92nd Japanese Diet opens tomorrow. Although several important bills will be submitted for discussion during the session, such as the budget for 1947-48, the Diet Law and the Election Law, and various laws related to labor and the economy, what Japanese politicians seem to be concerned about is whether the Supreme Commander's order for a general election and legislation will be carried out simultaneously in April. The Japanese people are quite indifferent to the speech that Prime Minister Yoshida intends to deliver at the opening of the Diet. It is expected that Yoshida will reiterate his old tune, asking the people to cooperate in seeking national revival and economic independence. The Liberal Party under Yoshida still maintains a majority in the Diet, enough to dismiss any motion of no confidence. According to some sources, the opposition Social Democratic Party is now considering a motion of no confidence against the Yoshida cabinet.</p>
<h3>US Interior Secretary Schedules Departure to Inspect Various Parts of the Pacific; Trip Related to Administrative Transfer Issues</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, December 12] Interior Secretary Krug announced today that he is scheduled to depart from Long Beach, California, on the 18th, via Oahu, Samoa, Guam, and Okinawa to Tokyo, to discuss the Pacific islands issue with MacArthur. He will be accompanied by Army and Navy officers and Interior Department officials such as Director Davison and Intelligence Director Skinner. The purpose of this trip is to consider changing the management of Guam, Samoa, and other Pacific islands from military control to the jurisdiction of the Interior Department. In addition, the United States plans to submit a draft trusteeship agreement on the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands to the Security Council on the 17th of this month.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Establishes Emergency Committee to Deal with Fuel Crisis; Officials and Civilians Unite to Combat Severe Winter and Coal Shortage</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, December 13 (Broadcast): Britain is still in a state of emergency today. British officials and civilians are fighting against the severe winter and coal shortage. Attlee personally leads his subordinates to participate in the work. The weather is clear, and hundreds of ships are sailing south to transport coal and fuel back to England to save the people from freezing and starvation. Troops in the Northwest and West have been dispatched to clear snow along railways and highways to facilitate coal transportation. Except for major industries, the use of electricity in all other areas has been uniformly suspended.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, December 12] Prime Minister Attlee announced today the establishment of an emergency committee composed of cabinet members and representatives from the Central Coal Board, the Central Electricity Authority, and the Railway Executive Committee to deal with the coal crisis. After holding its first meeting today, the committee resolved the following emergency measures: (1) The method of cutting off electricity supply to household users for five hours a day will be expanded to the entire country, meaning that households, shops, and entertainment venues are prohibited from using electricity during the power outage period; (2) Those who violate the order will be subject to a fine of up to 500 pounds and imprisonment for up to two years; (3) The control measures for industrial electricity use will not be further expanded; (4) The fuel consumption of dog racing is completely prohibited.

The implementation of the blackout order has caused the unemployment of many workers. It is estimated that the number of unemployed people in the blackout area has reached 1.2 million.</p>
<h3>A Key Military Location in the Pacific: Micronesia Islands (Part 2) - Our Newspaper Reference Room</h3>
<p>Future Disposal Methods</p>
<p>During World War II, the United States occupied many of these islands. After the end of the war, the United States considered these three groups of islands. Finally, US President Truman suggested placing the former Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific under the trusteeship of the United Nations, with the United States as the sole administrative authority. This means that the United States wants to obtain the management rights of the islands on behalf of Japan and wants to include Okinawa and Iwo Jima. However, trusteeship is different from mandate: (1) Under mandate, Japan was prohibited from establishing defenses, but in the proposed trusteeship, the United States has the right to establish military bases. (2) Under mandate, the stationing of troops was not allowed, but the US proposal allows for the stationing of troops and the taking of military action. (3) In the past, Japan did not comply with regulations and prohibited travel to the islands under mandate, but the US proposal allows for the signing of most-favored-nation treaties for member states of the United Nations. Furthermore, according to the UN Charter, the administrative power of the Trusteeship Council is extremely limited. The Security Council has the power to direct the Trusteeship Council to completely hand over political, economic, social, and educational matters within the so-called fortress area. In this view, trusteeship is only a part of military affairs.</p>
<p>Now that World War II has ended, international brewing is still extremely chaotic, and many people even worry that the next war is about to come. In this turbulent situation, the United States wants to obtain the special privilege of trusteeship of the islands, establish military bases on the islands, and prevent the UN Trusteeship Council from having the right to advise. Will this be discriminated against by other countries? This is the crux of the matter. Now the Soviet Union has responded, opposing the transfer of the islands by the UN Security Council to the United States for unilateral trusteeship, and declared that no final disposition can be made of this strategic area until the peace treaty with Japan is discussed.</p>
<p>The handling of these islands, which are related to the future security of the Pacific, will inevitably lead to a dispute. The security of the Pacific, of course, cannot be separated from the United States. In the past, because the United States missed the opportunity to acquire the islands, it encountered this great disaster. Japan used it as a tool to fight against Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and China. In the future, in order to maintain the security of the Pacific, the United States cannot easily give up. However, if the United States establishes military bases in the western Pacific, in the eyes of the Soviet Union, it will inevitably feel like a great threat.</p>
<p>However, how the islands will be handled still depends on the resolution in the peace conference. The principles and systems of the United Nations organization are the prerequisite for determining the fate of these islands. To maintain lasting world peace, everyone should cooperate openly and honestly and should never create a dark situation due to the conflict of interests between the two countries.</p>

<h3>Wallace Writes About Atomic Energy, Saying It Has Become an Open Secret</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, December 12] Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace wrote in his edited "New Republic Magazine" that Britain, France, and a certain Scandinavian country are building atomic energy plants. Those who think that atomic energy can still be kept secret are probably only Americans. He said that France is recently building atomic decomposition machines, and a certain Scandinavian country has at least one atomic decomposition machine that can produce in years. The atomic energy plant that Britain is building can also manufacture atomic bombs, so the United States can no longer say that it intends to disclose atomic secrets only when other countries can be trusted. He advocated that the United States cooperate with other United Nations to establish a world security system, sincerely seek disarmament plans, and no longer use atomic secrets as a threat.</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Alliance Negotiations to Begin in Days</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, December 12] Regarding the conclusion of an alliance treaty between Britain and France, British officials recently stated that the two countries will begin negotiations in two or three days.</p>
<h3>London Conference at Impasse; Final Meeting Held Today</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, December 12] Foreign Secretary Bevin said today in a speech to the Arab delegation that the solution to the Palestine issue is still far away. If the Jews and Arabs continue to reject the British government's solution, Britain may submit this issue to the United Nations organization. Bevin blamed the current impasse on both the Arab and Jewish sides and called on both sides to cooperate. It is said that if both sides can exercise sufficient statesmanship and actively seek a solution, it can increase their international prestige. The Labour Party opposes the 1939 White Paper, which restricts Jewish immigration to 1,500 per month. Britain feels that it has the complete right to amend this policy, and British troops cannot implement this restriction indefinitely. Earlier, Bevin listened to the Arab representatives explain the reasons for opposing the British plan. The Arab representatives strongly stated that Palestine should immediately declare undivided independence, stop the continued immigration of Jews, and fully protect Arab lands. Bevin promised to convey their opinions to the Cabinet and said that Britain's response would be presented at the final meeting on the 14th. Britain has no other plan besides the one that has been proposed.</p>

<h3>Chairman Sends Zheng Jiemin to Shanghai to Thoroughly Investigate the Inside Story of the Gold Rush</h3>
<p>Songhu Garrison Commander Yi Tiewu told reporters yesterday: "The recent financial fluctuations, soaring prices, and public panic have filled the entire society with an atmosphere of unease, like a powder keg about to explode. It is the duty of this headquarters to maintain public order, and we cannot turn a blind eye to it. The rice shops have been closing their doors in recent days, but in reality, it is not that there is no rice to sell. It is purely that unscrupulous merchants are hoarding and speculating in order to seek huge profits. The manipulation and monopoly by a few people has caused panic in the lives of the majority of citizens. Their despicable behavior is extremely heartbreaking. I have ordered the Investigation Department and the Police Bureau to order all personnel to immediately conduct a widespread search of rice shops throughout the city. If rice is found, they will be ordered to open their doors and sell it under police supervision. The price will be based on the highest market price one week ago (about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan). Warehouses throughout the city are also subject to search. Currently, rice merchants are using the high gold price as an excuse to raise the price of rice. In reality, all the rice they have in stock was definitely not purchased when the price rose from 70,000 to 80,000 yuan to more than 100,000 yuan. This is not a period of shortage of rice, and there is absolutely no problem with the source of rice. Moreover, the government has a large amount of rice in hand and will supply it continuously. There is absolutely no shortage. The excuses of the rice merchants are completely unfounded. Chairman Jiang is extremely concerned about the soaring prices in this city, especially the financial fluctuations, which have a huge impact on the national economy. Therefore, he has specially sent Mr. Zheng Jiemin, Director of the First Department of the Military Command, to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation with me. We will conduct a thorough investigation into who is manipulating this gold rush, who are the people who are buying up large quantities at high prices, and where the purchased gold is being transported and stored. If it is found that there is any behavior that manipulates the gold price and disrupts the financial system, we will definitely deal with it severely, and we will definitely not use the usual methods to deal with it. The situation of the market chaos and soaring prices in this city is obviously not a naturally formed phenomenon, but the result of human action. Therefore, the government is determined to overcome it with human power, and speculative merchants will soon reap the consequences."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Seeks to Stabilize Finance and Prices; Presents Four Emergency Proposals; Urges Immediate Re-establishment of Gold Policy</h3>
<p>Suggestions on Adjusting Production and Sales, Stabilizing Livelihoods</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce held an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday. In order to suppress financial prices, it was decided to send a telegram to the government, outlining emergency treatment plans. The main content is that suggestions have been made on re-establishing the gold policy, implementing import and export linkage, grasping hands-on investment, rationing daily necessities, and increasing production and conserving consumption. It is believed that the current stage of gold policy really needs to be re-examined, and it is impossible to sit idly by and let nature take its course. It is believed that the government's use of gold in the future can only choose one of the following two points: (1) If the gold reserves are abundant, as the authorities have repeatedly stated, then it should immediately continue to sell off a large amount at a parity price, and at the same time issue physical warehouse coupons to absorb floating capital, which will be issued with gold principal and interest when they expire in two or three years. In order to target the people's psychology of protecting the value of the currency, it can allocate gold reserves and invite representatives of public opinion organs and industrial and financial groups to organize a "Gold Reserve Inspection Committee" to conduct public inspections on a regular basis to show the people faith. (2) Otherwise, the government should immediately announce the cessation of the current gold policy, thoroughly prohibit gold speculation, and decouple gold prices from prices. It is also believed that how to choose between the two must be decided quickly and cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>Implement Rationing to Control Prices</p>
<p>Regarding grasping materials and controlling prices, it is believed that the British rationing system can be followed to stabilize prices and stabilize wages. That is, the government purchases and stores various materials at home and abroad when necessary for the daily needs of the people. On the one hand, it implements a regular and quantitative rationing system for materials that have been grasped, such as rice, kerosene, and cotton cloth. The method must be fair, and the period must be accurate. Only in this way can prices be controlled without being controlled by black market prices. Once prices can be stabilized, raw materials will be cheaper, and wages can also be maintained at a certain level without causing disputes at any time. Then the factory can work with peace of mind, and even export trade should have the hope of gradually improving.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Linked System Draft</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the import and export linked system, the full text of the draft adjustment of import and export trade measures is attached below:</p>
<p>(Chapter 1 General Provisions) Article 1: These measures are specifically formulated in order to revitalize exports, encourage the import of essential materials, so as to prosper the economy and adjust the trade balance. Article 2: After the implementation of these measures, the previously promulgated revised provisional measures for import and export trade and measures to encourage export trade, which conflict with these measures, shall be amended or repealed at the same time.</p>
<p>(Chapter 2 Export) Article 3: All goods except those listed in Schedule 5 (prohibited exports) may be freely exported, but the exporter shall submit a certificate from the designated bank proving the use of its foreign exchange to the customs for verification before being allowed to declare export. Article 4: The foreign exchange earned from exports shall be designated for use as foreign exchange required for imports, and the designated bank shall handle its related procedures.</p>
<p>(Chapter 3 Import) Article 5: All goods, except those in Schedule 4 (prohibited imports), shall be allowed to be imported only after completing the procedures in accordance with the provisions of these measures. Article 6: For the import of various goods belonging to Schedule 1 (production equipment), the importer may apply to the Central Bank for legal foreign exchange, which shall be provided by the government. Article 7: For the foreign exchange required for various goods belonging to Schedule 2 (originally under the quota system) and various goods belonging to Schedule 3A, the importer shall export local goods on its own, or purchase export foreign exchange from other exporters to offset it. The price is not restricted by the statutory exchange rate, but the government, in order to encourage the import of industrial equipment and raw materials, may separately list Schedule 3B to allow importers to apply to the Central Bank for a statutory exchange rate for 1/5 of the import amount. Article 8: The government shall designate several banks as foreign exchange banks. All foreign exchange supply and demand and certificates of importers and exporters shall be handled by the designated banks and reported to the Central Bank every week.</p>
<p>(Chapter 4 Low-Interest Loans) Article 9: For import and export transactions that meet the regulations and have all the certificates (order form, letter of credit, shipping contract, etc.), they may apply to the designated loan bank (Bank of China) for a low-interest loan, which shall be accepted by the designated foreign exchange bank. The term shall be three months, and it may be extended for another three months if necessary. The interest rate shall be 2% per month. Article 10: In order to prevent the hoarding of goods, on the due date of repayment, the customs export certificate and import certificate shall be submitted for verification. If the certificate cannot be provided by the deadline, it shall be treated as hoarding and penalized, and ordered to repay the interest calculated according to the current market rate, or 60% of the quantity of goods filled in at the time of applying for the loan.</p>
<p>Issuing Loans to Encourage Production</p>
<p>Increasing production and conserving consumption, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Chinese Farmers Bank shall immediately announce the implementation of this year's agricultural investment plan, step by step, for silk, tea, tung oil, hog bristles, cotton, wheat, etc. The production loan should be cut off and a large amount of loan should be made to avoid delaying the farming season, and it should be stipulated that part or all of the loan should be repaid with the produced physical objects. The price shall be evaluated by both parties according to the market value. This method shall also be applicable to loans from various factories. The government controls the above-mentioned physical objects for the needs of foreign sales and parity. The products of state-owned agencies shall be promoted for foreign sales as much as possible, and domestic consumption should be reduced to the minimum limit in order to increase foreign exchange and balance payments.</p>
<h3>Party Headquarters Executive Committee Resolves to Request Thorough Investigation of Gold Rush Causes</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters held its 47th Executive Committee meeting at 9 am yesterday in the conference hall of the headquarters, chaired by Chairman Fang, and resolved (A) Regarding the Quanggong Building incident, (1) Request the government to thoroughly investigate the culprits and punish the murderers, (2) Suggest the government to inform all kinds of mass gatherings in this city in the future must follow the practice of democratic countries and notify the police organs in advance to send police to maintain order. (B) Regarding the soaring gold price, (1) Please ask the Central Government to thoroughly investigate the reasons for the soaring gold price this time, and please thoroughly investigate the names of the firms and people who purchased gold and publish the list. (2) It is suggested that the Central Government strictly prohibit gold bars as a transaction currency. (3) It is suggested that the government order all stores to restore the original prices after the gold price drops for the prices that have soared due to the gold price rush in order to stabilize people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Circular to All Industries Not to Blindly Follow Price Increases</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified all industries yesterday: "To whom it may concern, in the past ten days, the price of gold has soared, and the prices of goods have also risen, which is the most intense trend in the past ten years since the war. In this situation, not only the national economy and people's livelihood are on the verge of despair, but the business community is also in a dilemma. If it collapses, how can there be any reason to be spared? For this reason, this association is worried day and night, and has no choice but to sincerely tell all of you in the business community. Since the national currency system changed to the managed currency system, gold and legal tender have lost a certain degree of connectivity. In other words, since gold is no longer the reserve for the issuance of national currency, it is no longer the measure of various prices. The free buying and selling of gold in the market, its market price rises and falls, is only equal to the market price rises and falls of jewelry and diamonds, and should no longer have the possibility of influencing prices. It is only because in recent years, the general psychology is easily stimulated, and there is always excessive speculation. In addition, there are those who add fuel to the fire, predicting what extent a certain price will rise, and spreading it to each other. If you are not surprised by the strange, then this trick will naturally be helpless. However, people's hearts are weak and easily fluctuate, often leading to a situation where one person starts and hundreds follow, competing with each other. In the beginning, this kind of psychology was nothing more than to avoid the situation of "replenishing missing goods" later. Their intention was still out of self-defense, but in the short term, wages, help materials, rent, and interest must also rise accordingly. The benefits of the price increase are just enough to offset it, and in fact it is still unhelpful, resulting in a situation where the books are profitable but the physical objects are short. This is the inner pain of today's general legitimate businessmen. This association is a merchant group, and it is deeply saddened that it has not been able to find a way to resolve this deformed phenomenon. According to the above situation, the current price increase is different from the two phenomena before the war. Before the war, the cost must increase before the price increase. Now, the price often rises first and the cost rises later. This opposite phenomenon is completely caused by the turbulent situation. In essence, it is manipulated by uneasiness, and the result is harmful to others and unhelpful to oneself. In addition to submitting to the government to re-determine the gold policy, implement import and export sales, grasp materials, control prices, increase production, and conserve consumption, this association hopes that our business community will deal with this difficult situation with calm reason. Unless the cost is indeed increased, do not blindly follow the price increase first. Even if there is a reason to increase the price, the standard must be legal profits, and do not make excessive price increases to avoid criticism and legal sanctions. It is easier to win by anticipation than by hope. I hope that your association will forward it to all industries for their information."</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Sends Letter to Authorities Requesting Investigation of Rumor-Mongering Truth; Matters Concern National Security, Not Just Personal Reputation</h3>
<p>Mr. Kong Xiangxi, a member of the Central Committee, recently sent letters separately to Mayor Wu and Supervisor Cheng, requesting them to dispatch personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth behind the rampant rumors caused by the recent surge in gold prices, in order to clarify the facts and rectify public opinion. His letter to Mayor Wu stated: "To Brother Guozhen, Honorable Mayor: The safety of a place lies in the stability of society. Recently, the drastic fluctuations in gold prices have caused widespread anxiety and soaring prices, breaking all previous records. Tracing the cause, it is purely due to malicious individuals spreading rumors, either seeking speculative profits or harboring other intentions, hoping to disrupt the security of Shanghai. Day by day, the situation worsens, with baseless fabrications and attacks against me personally, amplified by the wide circulation of tabloids, causing social unrest. The impact on my personal reputation is insignificant, but the safety of the nation and the stability of society are of utmost importance. Shanghai is the commercial center for both China and foreign countries, and the safety of friendly foreign nationals residing here is particularly important. If unscrupulous individuals are allowed to spread rumors, causing market disturbances, how can we face the nation and the people? This matter is of utmost importance. I urge you to dispatch personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth, severely punish the rumor-mongering villains, stabilize public sentiment, and ensure the safety of this city. This is what I hope for." The letter to Supervisor Cheng contained similar content, so it is not recorded here.</p>
<h3>Unscrupulous Merchants Hoarding White Rice; Three Locations Raided, Greatly Pleasing the Public</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] In recent days, the black market price of white rice has been rising crazily along with the gold rush, exceeding 150,000 yuan per dan. Although the municipal government is selling Saigon rice without restriction every day, it still cannot suppress the rising trend. Moreover, some rice shops, after receiving Saigon rice, are even privately raising prices and selling it in bulk, which seriously affects the people's food supply. The authorities have now dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate, and any rice shop found hoarding white rice will be forced to sell it at the assessed price.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 1:00 PM, Liu Liang, the owner of Taifeng Rice Shop at 217 Harbin Road (from Taixing), was reported to the Hudong Inspection Office of the Garrison Command for hoarding a large quantity of white rice. After dispatching personnel to investigate, in addition to discovering more than 40 dan in the room of the owner's wife, they also seized more than 260 dan on the third floor of Nanjing Bathhouse at 229 (owned by the same boss), all Changxi white rice. Immediately, together with the shop staff, they sold it all at the retail price of 1,000 yuan per liter at the shop, with a limit of five liters per person. After hearing the news, residents in the vicinity were overjoyed and lined up to buy, and it was sold out by the evening.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] At around 1:00 PM yesterday, a dispute arose at Jiang Yongsheng Rice Shop at 918 Yongxing Road, Zhabei, because the shop was closed and refused to sell rice to the public, causing a serious situation. Someone reported it to the Zhabei Police Bureau, and Branch Director Ying ordered Section Chief Wang to lead the police to the scene. It was learned that there were 63 dan of white rice hidden inside and upstairs in the shop, clearly hoarding for speculation. Section Chief Wang interrogated the shop assistants about whether there were other locations storing rice. They said that there was also a stockpile in Yongan Rice Shop at 786 Datong Road, so they went to search and found another 40 dan of white rice. At that time, Section Chief Wang, together with the district chief and the baojia chief, sealed the two shops with a seal, totaling 103 dan of rice. Subsequently, Jiang Yongsheng, the owner of Jiang Yongsheng Rice Shop, and Xu Yizhong, the owner of Yongan Rice Shop, were detained for interrogation. Jiang Yongsheng, the owner of Jiang Yongsheng Rice Shop, claimed to be 33 years old, from [unclear], and said that some of the rice belonged to a certain client who had deposited it there. When asked about the client's name and address, he could not answer. Xu Yizhong, the owner of Yongan Rice Shop, stated that he was 35 years old, from Dachang, and that a cart carrying 40 dan of white rice had recently been brought by a person with the surname Jiang, entrusting the shop to mill it. The branch bureau believed that Jiang and others had violated the regulations on hoarding food during extraordinary times and planned to send the two to the Garrison Command for investigation.</p>

<h3>Over One Hundred German Nationals to Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The special ship "Marine Jumper," which is sending the second batch of German nationals back to their country, will arrive in Shanghai from Tokyo on February 18. The Foreign Affairs Office of the Municipal Government yesterday issued a special announcement that all of the one hundred-plus German nationals in this batch must evacuate on time, otherwise they will be severely punished. It also warned the citizens not to harbor or conceal them, so as to avoid being implicated.</p>
<h3>Tired of Hearing, Tired of Hearing, Price Increases Repeatedly; Airlines Submit Request to Ministry Again; Moviegoers' Burden Doubles; Public Transportation Follows Suit</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] China and Central Airlines are confirming international dates. It is learned that the passenger and freight rates of both foreign airlines are about to increase, and this matter is still being requested from the Ministry of Communications. Due to insufficient income and expenditure, especially the passenger fares are not enough to offset the gasoline consumption, the two companies had submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications before the end of the year to increase fares and freight rates by 100%. However, this request has not yet been approved. Recently, the market has fluctuated, the black market for US dollars has soared, and gasoline prices have also risen accordingly. Moreover, a lot of aviation equipment and some foreign employees' salaries must be paid in US dollars, so the losses are increasing. Recently, the two companies have submitted a document to the Ministry of Communications again, urging them to approve the price increase.</p>
<p>From this month's sixteenth (Sunday), the ticket prices of cinemas in this city will be adjusted by about double. The ticket price for first-run cinemas is from 4,500 yuan to 8,000 yuan, the second-run is from 3,500 yuan to 6,000 yuan, the third-run is from 2,500 yuan to 5,000 yuan, and the fourth-run is from 2,000 yuan to 4,000 yuan. Each cinema will set its new ticket price within the above standards according to the location. At the same time, the ticket price is the same regardless of day or night, Sunday or holidays.</p>
<p>Due to the increase in fuel prices and the collection of surcharges on coal and diesel, the price of trams and buses in this city may increase soon. The new fare may increase by 100%, and the exact amount is currently being calculated by the municipal authorities.</p>
<h3>Mayor Sincerely Expresses That Residents Should Rest Assured</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Mayor Wu said when he met with reporters at the Municipal Government yesterday: He is making every effort to stabilize the prices of general major commodities in this city. He believes that the current fluctuations in general commodity prices are mainly affected by fluctuations in gold and banknote prices. However, the central authorities are planning a comprehensive financial and economic strategy and will implement it soon, so the fluctuations in gold and banknotes are obviously at the end of their rope and can be easily defeated. As far as the major commodities under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government are concerned, for the issue of rice, the Municipal Government now has sufficient power to supply 2 million bags of rice. Therefore, before the new rice arrives in the fall, there will be no problem with rice in this city. In recent days, the Municipal Government has also been selling 10,000 dan of Saigon rice every day at a price of 63,000 yuan per dan. This amount is sufficient for the city's daily consumption and more. The Municipal Government has also dispatched police to conduct random inspections of rice shops' rice sales to prevent rice shops from selling large amounts to customers and hoarding them privately. Starting yesterday, the municipal government will distribute 12,000 bags of rice at a fixed price and will not stop it. In terms of cooking oil, private factories lack raw materials, and solutions are being sought. However, the state-run China Vegetable Oil is still operating as usual. He sincerely hopes that the citizens will rest assured and cooperate with the authorities to prevent speculators from using their tricks.</p>
<h3>Compulsory Vaccination Promotion Associations Established One After Another</h3>

<h3>Hiding Fourteen Barrels of Oil, Bribing 200,000 Yuan; Gas Station Staff Arrested and Interrogated</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] When Sergeant Pan Ronglu of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police was patrolling at 8:00 PM on the 10th of this month, he passed the Asia Petroleum Company gas station at 58 Fenhuangdu Road and saw that there were many cars waiting to refuel, but the staff at the station said that the gasoline had been sold out. At about 11:00 PM that night, he passed the same place again, and there was only one small private car at the gas station. The staff at the station were pouring gasoline into oil drums, so he went over to check and saw that there were fourteen barrels of gasoline hidden in the station. Xia Tingqing, the manager of the station, immediately greeted Pan Ronglu and offered a Xinhua Bank礼券 of 200,000 yuan as a bribe. Pan accepted it and, after leaving the station, summoned nearby police and Bao chief Huang Xiaozhong to the station again to ask them to prove that there were indeed fourteen barrels of gasoline hidden in the station. He then brought Xia Tingqing and the Xinhua Bank礼券 back to the regimental headquarters and transferred him to the District Attorney's Office on charges of bribery.

<h3>Love Triangle; Female Servant Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Zhu family at 14 He Da Lane, Pushi Road, hired a female servant, Shen Amao (26 years old, from Huzhou). Recently, due to illness, she was sent to her aunt Chen Wenjun at 471 Xiaoshadu Road for temporary residence. After a few days, her illness worsened, so on the 5th, she was accompanied by her aunt to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for treatment. She died on the 7th. According to the doctor's examination, the deceased suffered serious injuries to her chest and knees, and it was feared that she had been beaten to death before her death. Her aunt reported the information to the Jiangning Branch Bureau, and Section Chief Chen sent staff Wang Qi, together with police officers Lu Tianci and Gu Songlin, to investigate. It was learned that the deceased had an affair with a cook, Wu Chengbing, who is now employed at 19 Dumei Road. The police officers arrested Wu on the 8th and brought him to the bureau. He admitted that the affair was true, but denied the assault. Later, they summoned Abao and Aqi, who were also female servants in the Zhang Xujing family at the same address, to the bureau for interrogation. They confessed that Amao also had a lover, Yan Aqing, also known as Ma Pi Aqing, who was a porter and whose address was unknown. It was only known that he had a relative, Wei Luosheng, who was a tea waiter at the Chunjiang Inn at the entrance of the Yunnan Road vegetable market. When Yan came to Shanghai from his hometown, he always rented a room at the inn. The police officers went to Wei's place to inquire about Yan's whereabouts and learned that Aqing had returned to Xiecun, Shuanglin Town, Wuxing County, his original home. The police officers took a car overnight to the above-mentioned location, but Yan had already taken goods to Shanghai. They tracked him back to Shanghai and went straight to Chunjiang Inn to investigate. They arrested him at the inn and brought him to the bureau for interrogation, but he also denied everything. According to the testimony of the two female servants, at about 8:00 PM on the 2nd, Wu Chengbing came first, and then Yan Aqing, the lover of the relationship, also came. Amao had difficulty coping with it. Wu Chengbing suddenly left first and said that he would never come again. Not long after, Aqing and Amao quarreled, and Amao was punched and beaten by Aqing. After the preliminary trial by the branch bureau, although there was no evidence that Yan had committed the assault, he was suspected of being a major offender, and it was planned to send Wu and Yan together to the District Attorney's Office for review.</p>
<h3>Postage Increase Not Yet Approved; Postal Bureau Faces Many Difficulties Due to Insufficient Funds</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] A reporter interviewed a person in charge of the Postal Bureau yesterday, and he told about various aspects of the postal service: (1) Regarding the postage increase, the General Bureau has indeed submitted it to the government, but it is not yet known whether it will be approved and how much it will be increased. In fact, even if it rises to 500 yuan for ordinary letters, it will not be enough to make up for the Postal Bureau's losses. (2) After Xu [unclear]zhuang, the Director-General of the Postal Administration, resigned, the ministry appointed Deputy Director Huo to take over, but Huo坚 firmly requested to resign because of the many difficulties in the Postal Bureau, and the handover has not yet been completed, forming a stalemate. (3) Due to the Postal Bureau's insufficient income and expenditure, the authorities intend to reduce the salaries of employees, but in fact, it may be difficult to reduce the benefits that employees have already received. If the postal service continues like this, it will not end well. He believes that the solution is to advance on three fronts: first, the government approves the price increase and continues to subsidize it; second, the people understand the difficulties of the Postal Bureau and do not attack the price increase; third, the postal employees should be united and willing to make concessions on their benefits to overcome the difficulties together. (4) The Postal Bureau in this city has recently implemented a new facility, which is to add special mailboxes in key areas to collect express mail along the Beijing-Shanghai line. These mailboxes are painted gray with red letters. The collection time is later than ordinary mailboxes. Mail dropped before 10:00 PM can be delivered to cities along the Beijing-Shanghai line by the night express train the next day.</p>

<h3>The Task of Miss 09 at the Telephone Company Information Desk</h3>
<p>Specializing in Checking and Answering Telephone Numbers; Working Tensely and Skillfully Day and Night</p>
<p>[Our Special Article] When you want to make a phone call but don't know the phone number, just dial "09" and ask, and the difficulty can be easily solved.</p>
<p>"09" is the number of the Shanghai Telephone Company's information desk, and its special task is to answer inquiries about telephone numbers.</p>
<p>The "Information Desk" provides services day and night, 24 hours a day without interruption. It is divided into four shifts every day, and each shift has twelve "Miss 09" to answer various inquiries about telephone numbers.</p>
<p>Their work is very tense. On average, each person has to answer more than fifty inquiries every hour. Because they all have more than two or three years of experience, they work very skillfully.</p>
<p>The telephone directories they check are loose-leaf, rotating, with Chinese arranged according to the number of strokes and English arranged in alphabetical order. Due to the accumulation of experience, they have memorized the number of strokes of each character, so they can check them very quickly.</p>
<p>Whether the phone number is in the phone book or not, they can find it, but many party and government leaders, social celebrities, and military agencies are unwilling to publish their phone numbers, and they also refuse to answer.</p>
<p>The most inquiries about phone numbers are for restaurants, hotels, and theaters, and the "Miss 09" are already familiar with the phone numbers of these places. They don't need to check them and can answer them immediately. The busiest time is from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>The most headache for "Miss 09" is that some people often deliberately harass them under the pretext of inquiring about telephone numbers, hindering their normal work.</p>
<p>The "Information Desk" also has an important task, which is to record the movement of various telephones at any time. Because many telephones often change hands and change the name of the household, for the convenience of inquiries, they must also change the owner of the telephone at any time.</p>
<p>The "Clock" That Can Talk</p>
<p>In addition to the telephone number information desk, the telephone company also has a time service. If you want to know the standard time, just dial "95678" and you can hear someone reporting alternately in Shanghai dialect and English.</p>
<p>When asking about the time, there is one thing to pay attention to, that is, you don't need to speak, because the ears of the lady reporting the standard time are blocked with cork, so no matter how loudly you shout, she can't hear you.</p>
<p>Usually, after we dial "95678," we always think that the lady reporting the standard time is directly answering us. In fact, she is just sitting there, looking at the standard clock, and reporting to the sound transmitter forever. She doesn't need to answer the phone. Her job is just to keep reporting. A person is changed every fifteen minutes, and everyone takes turns. It never stops in 24 hours. They are always sitting there, reporting "10:15, Ten Fifteen, 10:15..." This is perhaps the most mechanical job in the world. A young person becomes a talking clock.</p>

<h3>Stable Life - The Social Affairs Bureau Drafts Measures - Rationing System for Daily Necessities - The City Government's Discussion Items Today Include Seven Items: Rice, Coal, Oil, Sugar, Salt, and Cloth - Temporarily Limited to Public Education, Cultural Circles, and Industrial Workers</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, upon receiving a telegram from the Chairman, took the night train to Nanjing last night to discuss ways to suppress commodity prices in the city. Mayor Wu, due to busy official duties, did not accompany him. The General Manager of the Textile Construction Company, Shu Zhang, was represented by Deputy General Manager Wu Weijing due to illness, and left for Nanjing yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Director Wu told reporters at his private residence yesterday: Last year, the focus of the Social Affairs Bureau's work was on handling labor-capital disputes. This year, the focus is on how to enable people to live. If factories go bankrupt and workers become unemployed, leading to mutual destruction, then there will be no so-called labor or capital.</p>
<p>Increasing Cost of Living - Inevitable Crisis</p>
<p>Commodity prices have been fluctuating violently recently, and people's lives have been greatly affected. Public educators, industrial workers, and cultural workers are struggling on the brink of starvation, which cannot be ignored. If effective measures are not taken to provide substantial remedies, the increase in the cost of living index will inevitably affect the cost of all manufactured goods. The increase in the cost of various goods will inevitably affect general living expenses. Such a cycle of repeated increases will inevitably hinder production, increase unemployment, and plunge the entire social economy and social order into a crisis that cannot be sustained. It was previously heard that the Chairman's Office would ration daily necessities to public educators to stabilize their lives. A few days ago, I also suggested to Mayor Wu that a system of rationing daily necessities at affordable prices be implemented for public educators, industrial workers, and female chemical workers in the city. After there is a surplus, a goods supply center will be established to distribute goods at affordable prices to the general public. This measure will be submitted to the municipal meeting on the 14th (today) morning for discussion. However, because rice and oil for rationing are held by the Ministry of Food, coal is held by the Fuel Management Committee, and cloth is managed by the Textile Construction Company, I am waiting for President Song to come to Shanghai to ask for instructions. Now that President Song is still in Nanjing, and I have received a telegram from the Chairman, I will contact all relevant parties about this matter after going to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Regarding the resignation issue, Director Wu said: My purpose is not to be an official, but to do things. Mayor Wu has expressed his full support for the proposed system of rationing daily necessities at affordable prices. If it can be implemented, I will try it. Otherwise, the Social Affairs Bureau cannot function and will still resign.</p>
<p>Main Content of the Proposed Measures</p>
<p>In order to stabilize life and suppress commodity prices, the Social Affairs Bureau has formulated the first step of the rationing measures, the main content of which is:</p>
<p>(1) The rationing items are limited to daily necessities. The items and the allocation amount for each household are tentatively set as follows: (A) One dan of rice per month, (B) One dan of coal briquettes per month, (C) Five jin of cooking oil per month, (D) Three jin of sugar per month, (E) One zhang and five chi of cloth per quarter, (F) Five jin of salt per month, (G) Two bags of flour per month (Those who do not eat rice can apply to have it changed to flour).</p>
<p>(2) Eligible recipients: (A) Public educators stationed in the city and by the Central Government in Shanghai, (B) Workers in public utilities and industrial workers in the city, (C) Cultural workers employed in the city. The number of personnel in category A shall be based on the legally approved establishment. The personnel in categories B and C shall be limited to those whose respective groups have been legally registered with the local competent authorities. However, if more than one person in each household is engaged in the above-mentioned work, only one share will be rationed.</p>
<p>(3) If the products of state-owned or government-managed factories meet the uses of the above-mentioned Article 1, they shall first provide flat-priced rationing according to the quantity approved by the rationing agency, and the rest shall be sold by the factories themselves.</p>
<p>(4) When workers in each factory apply for rationing, if the products of each factory meet the uses of the above-mentioned Article 1, the rationing agency may approve the quantity and ration them at flat prices, and the rest shall still be sold by each factory itself.</p>
<p>(5) If the products of private factories are not included in the above-mentioned Article 1 (such as soap, matches, cigarettes, medicinal oil, etc.), and their workers have been approved for rationing upon application, the rationing agency may approve the quantity and order them to be rationed at flat prices separately in order to promote the extension.</p>
<p>(6) Factories that provide rationing items may be given preferential treatment and fully supplied with electricity and other needs.</p>
<p>(7) The price of rationing items shall be jointly formulated by the rationing agency and another review committee, and submitted to the municipal government for approval before being announced and implemented.</p>
<p>(8) For factories that are allowed to provide rationing, if their wages are calculated and paid according to the cost of living index, the rationing items included in the index shall be recalculated according to the rationing price.</p>
<p>(9) The above-mentioned rationing affairs shall be handled by a temporary organization organized by the municipal government. Its staffing and expenses shall be submitted for approval separately.</p>

<h3>Another Gang of Thieves Caught on the Beijing-Shanghai Train - Impersonating Soldiers to Specialize in Cutting Open Suitcases</h3>
<p>The Police Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration recently cracked another organized gang of pickpockets called the "Yuehan Gang" who specialize in impersonating soldiers and stealing on the Beijing-Shanghai train. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>After cracking the "Four Famous Mountains" case, Police Chief Wang Zhaohu secretly ordered plainclothes officers from the Shanghai-Wuxi section to disguise themselves as passengers and infiltrate the train to investigate. On the morning of February 12, a passenger named Zhou Zhengqing on the second-class carriage of Train No. 11 from Beijing to Shanghai discovered that his suitcase had been cut open and the cash stored inside had been lost. He reported the information to the railway police on the train and requested an investigation. Upon receiving the news, the railway police and plainclothes officers immediately conducted a secret investigation in the carriage and discovered a young man in military uniform who was behaving suspiciously. Under interrogation, the "soldier" hesitated and stammered. After a search, the original thief was found on the spot. When the train arrived at Shanghai Station, the railway police escorted him to the Shanghai-Wuxi section. Section Chief Zhu Yifei and Branch Section Chief Zhang Hanying personally interrogated him. According to his confession: His name is Zuo Xiujian, and there are more than 30 members in the gang. They originally committed crimes on the Yuehan Railway and have the nickname "Yuehan Gang." Now, because the Yuehan Railway has been damaged and they cannot survive, they have come to Shanghai to specialize in wearing military uniforms and pretending to be soldiers on the Beijing-Shanghai express train. When passengers are asleep, they use small foreign knives made of pure steel to cut open suitcases and steal items.

<p>[Report from this newspaper] An Indian named Ama Xing, also known as Amu Xing, resides at No. 469 Jiangning Road. At the end of last year, he left Shanghai for business. An elderly British woman, Lin Shunyou (also known as Lin Zhen, Luo Xin, 47 years old, renting a house at No. 16, K-character, Dunne Li, Baike Road), learned that Ama Xing had gone to another port.

<h3>Reader Information: Legal Queries</h3>
<p>(1) A Young Aunt's Affection</p>
<p>Li Huizhen asks: My friend married Miss A several years ago, and their relationship is harmonious. Miss A has a younger sister, Miss B, who, because she often sees my friend, has also developed a romantic relationship with him. They have vowed to marry each other, and Miss A also expresses her deep approval. However, both families are old-fashioned, so they have not spoken up for a long time. Now there are several questions I would like to ask and would be grateful for your answers: (1) Both the man and the woman are of legal age. Can they freely unite? Does the law allow this? (2) Do both sets of parents have any legal grounds to sue, making it possible for the two people to be found guilty? (3) Given that Miss A has already given her approval, can the wedding still be held? [Answer from Lawyer Cao Yaxia] The law does not allow a person who is already married and has a spouse to remarry another person. If someone who has a spouse remarries, it is a violation of the crime of obstructing marriage as stipulated in the criminal law, and there is a possibility of imprisonment for up to five years. The person marrying them is also guilty of the same. Therefore, regardless of whether Miss A approves, your friend cannot hold a wedding with Miss B. If they want to accommodate the facts, then Miss B does not need to get married. They can live together with the purpose of living together as a family, with Miss B as a member of your friend's family.</p>
<p>(2) Remarrying Another</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaozhen asks: A certain lady, my friend, is now twenty-five years old and has a son. Her husband died of illness three years ago. Now I have several questions, please answer them, I will be eternally grateful. (1) If the lady intends to remarry immediately, do I need to go through legal procedures to separate her from the man's family? (2) Who should raise her son? (3) Can she leave without informing them? (4) If the third method is used, will there be any disputes in the future? (5) After remarrying, will the mother be separated from the relationship?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Cao Yaxia] (1) No need to go through the procedures. (2) The paternal grandparents should raise the son. (3) Yes. But it is best to find a way to let the paternal grandparents know about the situation. (4) No. Only if there are no outstanding debts and no possessions belonging to others are taken. (5) Cannot be separated.</p>

<h3>Tightening Credit Leads to Shift in Speculative Funds: Gold Notes Gradually Stabilizing; Closing Price Up 500,000 From Previous Session</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Speculation has stabilized yesterday. Most speculative funds are shifting towards yarn stocks. Early morning reports indicate that emergency countermeasures will be implemented soon. The market opened at 6.7 million to 6.9 million, then immediately fell to 6.2 million to 6.3 million. After 10:00 AM, the Central Bank distributed 640 bars at a price of 6.3 million. After this, the situation stabilized, and the high price rose to 6.9 million. Credit tightened, and with yarn and cloth allocation, speculative funds shifted. Near noon, the price dropped to 6.3 million, and at noon it stood at around 6.5 million. In the afternoon, overnight delivery opened close to the 7 million mark, with a high price of 7.7 million, then became hesitant. Evening reports indicated a ban on gold note speculation, and the price dropped to 6.75 million. Finally, it remained at around 7.2 million, resulting in a rebound of 500,000 compared to the previous closing price. Gold ornaments were listed at 680,000, and silver dollars rose slightly. The black market overnight interest rate remained tight, with interest rates at around 1.8 cents.</p>
<p>Foreign currency also stabilized yesterday. US dollars opened in the black market at 12,000 to 13,000 in the morning, with the high price only slightly exceeding 14,000, lacking significant changes. The market remained stable in the afternoon, but trading seemed sluggish. The result was a rise of 1,000 compared to the previous close. Hong Kong banknotes rose from around 2,600 to the 3,000 mark, and the result was also a 100 increase before the previous close. The foreign exchange market lacks formal trading, and dealers remain hesitant. The Hong Kong exchange rate fell to 2,700, the Indian exchange rate to 3,300, and the British exchange rate to 43,500. Market conditions are chaotic, and there is very little trading.</p>
<p>Continuous Surge in Gold Prices is Purely Fictitious Transactions Among Dealers</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, a financial observer said: Observing the trend of gold in the past one or two days, it seems to be returning from splendor to simplicity. He believes that the peak of 8 to 9 million a few days ago was purely a fictitious price among dealers, and the actual transaction volume was extremely small. Powerful and prudent speculators only temporarily held a wait-and-see attitude when the market shouted a false price of over 9 million, and dared not act rashly. Now, the authorities' emergency countermeasures are about to be implemented, so the future of gold prices is predicted to hover around the 5 to 6 million mark. As for rumors of the government taking back the funds, he believes that it is unlikely. The government currently holds sufficient gold, enough to publicly sell and stabilize gold prices. Implementing nationalization at this time would only stimulate gold prices to rise further, which would not help in practice. However, he believes that the government's current policy on gold may continue to supply small amounts of gold for people's daily ornaments. However, for the part of gold that is used for speculative purposes, it will find ways to eradicate it, so that gold will no longer become the initiator of speculative waves.</p>
<h3>Accounts for Selling Gold Can be Announced at Any Time</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the outside world's request for the Central Bank to announce the accounts for selling gold and the names of the buyers, this reporter specifically visited the responsible persons of the Central Bank's Operations Bureau and Audit Department yesterday. They all said that President Bei had not yet returned to Shanghai, so it was not convenient to express their opinions. However, they said: The Central Bank's usual allocation and sale of gold is only to members of the recognized gold industry association. Therefore, the accounts are simple and can be made public at any time.</p>
<p>Continued Decline in Government Bonds</p>
<p>Government bonds continued to decline yesterday. Unified bonds</p>
<p>Opened at 650 in the morning, then sold from 614 and 452, retreating to 2600. 550 took advantage of the low price to maintain it and rose to 2700 at the end. The result was a further drop of 350 compared to the previous close. A and B each dropped 250, and D and E also fell 300. The transaction was 3 million.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks Recover</p>
<p>Foreign stocks recovered slightly yesterday, but the process was volatile. Foreign firms made more efforts to acquire paper companies such as Jardine Matheson, and the results were all closed at high prices. As a result, shipping rose by 20%, British Union rose by 15%, Jardine Matheson Yisha rose by more than 10%, and Yeguang Paper rose by 5%. The rest all rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Continued Decline in Silk</h3>
<p>The silk market continued to soften yesterday. 120-count rayon opened at 6.23 million in the morning, then declined, trading at 5.98 million. In the afternoon, there were many who bought at low prices, and it rose again, with a asking price of 6.1 million. Finally, it was raised by 400,000, but the result was still 200,000 lower than the previous day. Factory prices also fell due to the decline in gold prices. The transaction prices for C-grade varied. The largest transaction was 7.5 million, and the smallest was 200,000, with some transactions. The asking price for D-grade was 7 million, which was more than 300,000 lower than the previous day. The asking prices for ordinary goods and Qianjing were both 200,000 lower than the previous day. Due to the drop in raw materials, factory prices for silk fabrics also decreased. The asking price for Meiya quilt fabric was 4.3 million, and the asking price for rayon quilt fabric was 3 million. Yesterday, there was a transaction at 2.85 million. Dachang Gebi crepe was 16,000, and Huazhong crepe was listed at 6,200, with transactions at 6,000. Rayon feather yarn was in short supply, and yesterday's price was the same as Huajin crepe. The asking prices for Sheng Hang goods remained the same as the original prices from the previous day. The market was very weak, and the market trend may still depreciate, so yesterday's silk transactions were very limited.</p>
<h3>Goods Must Be Shipped Within Three Months After Issuance of Import Permits</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank issued Circular No. 12 of the Second Category to each designated bank yesterday, making some revisions to the provisions of the first paragraph of Circular No. 10 of the Second Category. The circular briefly stated: Goods listed in Annexes 1 and 3A must be shipped within three months from the date of issuance of the import permit. Furthermore, the validity period of the permit is limited to four months from the end of the month in which the goods are shipped.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions are Sparse</h3>
<p>Although it was raining heavily yesterday, export firms continued to demand various types of export tea. At the same time, local shops were also frequently considering adding Longjing and Dafang varieties for domestic sales, so there was a lot of buying in the market. However, those who held the goods were still shrewd, holding on to their goods, resulting in a supply imbalance and sparse transactions.</p>
<h3>Even Though Rice and Glutinous Rice Have Not Arrived, the Black Market Has Already Collapsed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The food rice and miscellaneous grain markets, which had been crazy for several days, began to fall back yesterday. People were nervous, and under the atmosphere of selling, prices fell across the board. Those who held the goods were wary of the high prices and secretly sold off. In addition, the social police and security bureaus tightened their crackdowns, strictly checking the movement of rice and grain at various intersections. Therefore, rice merchants were deeply restrained and were very cautious. Rice shops were also reluctant to buy in because it was not easy to sell, so the market began to experience a tragic downturn. Asking prices outside the market fell by more than 30,000 yuan. High-quality white rice was 135,000 yuan. There were no buyers in the market, and the market remained stagnant. However, the arrival of glutinous rice gradually increased. A total of more than 700 stones arrived in the market, and the market also showed signs of weakness. The distribution of No. 2 Saigon rice by the Social Bureau was temporarily suspended yesterday because the shipment procedures had not been completed.</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Due to the decline in rice prices, people's hearts were shaken, and cargo owners sold off when prices were high. Buyers were hesitant to move forward. Under the situation of more sellers than buyers, the market price fell sharply. The prices of various brands of flour fell by 56,000 yuan. The closing price of Bingchuan and Lao Che flour was 55,000 yuan. The closing price of Lilang foreign flour was 72,000 yuan. There were no buyers for these prices in the market, and it is expected that prices will continue to fall. Wheat also fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Edible Oil</p>
<p>The sharp decline continued. Because the previous rise had aligned prices with those in other regions, many merchants shipped goods in, resulting in a sell-off in the market from the beginning of the day yesterday. However, there were few buyers. Lou Sheng oil fell to 240,000 yuan, then fell further to 230,000 yuan. The lowest price for Jilong Sheng oil fell to 250,000 yuan, and the closing price was 260,000. Sheng oil plummeted by more than 40,000 yuan. Although there were few transactions in soybean oil, the market also quietly fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Small-cart sesame oil also fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Jilong vegetable oil fell to 270,000 yuan in transactions.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains</p>
<p>The fall in yellow beans was particularly severe. There were four shipments from the Northeast, one of which had already arrived at the port and was being unloaded. Therefore, people's hearts were greatly weakened. The supply of samples was abundant, and cargo owners were eager to sell for cash. The final price for Dalian and Tianjin goods was 70,000 yuan, a decline of 10,000 yuan. Other goods also fell by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Only Huang Ma sesame had a small number of transactions, and the market also fell by 20,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were oversupplied and fell by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan, but there were still few takers. The price of bean cake raw materials was weak, and small holders rushed to sell, causing the price to fall by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Tea beans and corn were both weak and lacked transactions. Cotton cake also fell by 2,000 to 3,000.</p>
<h3>Coal Trends are Softening</h3>
<p>The number of sellers in the coal market is gradually increasing, but asking prices are still erratic. Buyers are wary because coal prices have risen sharply in recent days and the prices of various commodities have fallen back, so they are very hesitant and their willingness to buy is very sluggish. Therefore, transactions are quite sparse. The actual transaction price of Kaiping train coal has fallen from 1.1 million to 1.023 million yuan. There were also reports of Hong Yikuai taking advantage of the high price of 1.56 million to sell, so the trend of the coal market may be softening. The new prices for firewood and charcoal have been announced, but buyers find the prices too high to afford, so transactions are also flat.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Actual Sales are Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market continued to move downstream. Dealers were eager to sell, but actual sales were few. Buyers did not buy, and factories also waited and watched, so the price of 10-count yarn fell by another 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, and the trend seemed to be sluggish.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Yarn Purchase Prices Still Requires Instructions from the President</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The 24th regular meeting of the Spinning Management Committee was held at 4:00 PM yesterday in the City Hall conference room. Wu, the concurrent chairman, Li, the vice chairman, and committee members Wang Qiyu, Rong Hongyuan, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Liu Wenteng, director of the Spinning Management Committee's Business Office, and Wang Ziyuan, director of the Secretariat Office, attended the meeting. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. The main agenda items were three: (1) Based on the conclusions of the technical symposium discussed by representatives of National, Private, and Foreign yarn factories, revise the cotton yarn inspection standards and grade regulations. (2) Revise the method of taking yarn samples, adding item (C) to Article 4, with the text: "The yarn and bobbins taken in the preceding paragraph shall be returned to each factory after the testing is completed." Other items remain the same. (3) Regarding the adjustment method of cotton yarn purchase prices for February, it will be decided after seeking instructions from President Song.</p>
<p>Furthermore, two factories have already submitted warehouse receipts for the cotton yarn purchased by the committee.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Directive Approves the Management Regulations for Tobacco Leaf Businesses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau, upon instruction from the Ministry of Finance, approved the Management Regulations for Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Businesses. All businesses in the Shanghai area that sell tobacco leaves, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign merchants, must fill out an application registration form and submit it along with a certificate from the local competent authority permitting them to operate, and apply to the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau for a registration certificate. Tobacco leaf businesses may only sell tobacco leaves and may not sell shredded tobacco or shred and sell tobacco themselves. Tobacco leaf businesses may not sell tobacco leaves to unregistered tobacco factories or shredded tobacco shops. The Shanghai import and export supplementary taxes, domestic sales, and sales of tobacco to shredded tobacco shops must all fill out the tobacco leaf business's notification of sale, original and duplicate return receipts, and send them to the Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Business Association for seal and certification, then send them to the Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau for verification along with the tax certificate and import and export goods with a yellow declaration form. The above management regulations have been notified by the Goods Tax Bureau to the Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Business Association, instructing its members to comply. It is now heard that the association is studying the implementation procedures.</p>
<p>Cloth Prices are Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened steadily. After 10:00 AM, due to the decline in gold prices, there were more sellers. Three A Colorful Ball fine cloth fell sharply by 18,000 yuan. Four Gentlemen and Jin Yin Biji followed suit and fell by 13,000 yuan. However, high-end 190 Shilin cloth only fell by 5,000 yuan per bolt due to strong dye prices. By 11:00 AM, it was heard that the Spinning and Construction Company had raised its cloth sales prices, and people's hearts became firm again.</p>
<p>Business Summary</p>
<p>Paper</p>
<p>Prices have risen sharply for several days, and the prices of all grades of goods have reached their peak. Yesterday, prices fell slightly. Canadian white newsprint was 120,000 per ream, down 30,000 yuan. Most other paper also fell. Prices fell across the board. Saccharin was 430,000, down 50,000 yuan. Quinine was 400,000, down 70,000 yuan. The outlook is still generally bearish.</p>
<p>Cigarettes</p>
<p>Prices fell sharply across the board. The market was filled with selling voices. Ten large British cigarettes fell by 500,000 yuan per case in the morning. Guben soap was opened at 230,000, but there were still few takers. Beautiful matches retreated to 2 million yuan. Foreign candles have not yet been traded.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>The stock of raw materials is scarce, and cargo owners are hoarding. The market is becoming firmer. Long boots are exquisitely designed and popular, rising sharply by 60,000 yuan per dozen. However, the stock of tires from various brands is abundant, and the market is stable.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<p>Market conditions are gradually stabilizing, but the arrival of human head sandpaper is not much, and sales are very smooth, with each ream rising to 650,000 yuan. The price of foreign nails fell with gold prices. Due to the high price of raw materials, the cost of locks far exceeded the selling price. Hinge prices were not opened by factories, and the goods on the market were scarce, so prices continued to rise.</p>
<p>Timber</p>

<h3>Import and Export Management Committee Prevents Hoarding of Imported Industrial Raw Materials; Must Be Sold Directly to Production Factories; Cigarette and Rubber Industries Have Already Done So</h3>
<p>The Import and Export Management Committee believes that more than 90% of imports in the second category are industrial raw materials. In order to avoid manipulation by intermediaries and hoarding by wealthy individuals, it has decided that imported goods should be sold to production factories. The monthly production quantity and the raw materials required must be reported by each importer. The committee will allocate goods to importers based on the production needs of each factory and according to quotas. The committee is now starting with importers in the rubber and cigarette industries and will gradually extend this to several types of imported industrial raw materials. It has issued survey forms, notifying each importer to report the quantity ordered and the sales situation, including the factories ordering goods abroad, the date of shipment, the name of the ship, the name of the goods ordered, the location of sales, and the quantity sold. In addition, goods ordered last year that have recently been imported should be included in this year's quota. If the recent arrival of goods accounts for 20% of this year's quota, then this year's import quota will only be 80%.</p>
<h3>New Pharmaceutical Industry Requests the Import and Export Management Committee to Improve the Import Method of Western Medicines</h3>
<p>[Report] The New Pharmaceutical Association and several pharmaceutical associations jointly requested the Import and Export Management Committee to improve the import method based on the nature of the medicines. For medicines that our country can manufacture itself, please prohibit imports. For medicines that our country cannot manufacture but are urgently needed, please allow large-scale imports so that our country's pharmaceutical industry will not be hit by foreign imports, and patients will not be delayed due to high prices or shortages of medicines. It has been decided that this submission will be presented today.</p>
<p>Also, recently, the prices of Western medicines have risen sharply due to the high price of the US dollar, rising by an average of more than two times. According to a person in charge of the New Pharmaceutical Association, before the establishment of the import and export management committee, the Western medicine industry in this city ordered a large number of American goods, resulting in a surplus of various American medicines in the market and a general decline in prices. Many medicines even fell below cost. Since the quota import method was stipulated, it has been difficult to apply for permits. In addition, the black market price of the US dollar has risen sharply, and the prices of various medicines have followed the US dollar, rising by one to three times. The prices of ordinary unpopular medicines have risen by one time, and the prices of popular medicines such as Bile Tuo, Gaishi Weixiong, and Cibaoming have risen to four times. However, compared with the current market price and the US dollar black market, it cannot be considered high. In addition, the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan has recently decided to allocate a portion of the American goods Ateping and Sulfamine preparations in its inventory to various pharmaceutical merchants, so the market price of such medicines may remain stable. Furthermore, recently, a large number of Commie milk powder, Monsanto saccharin, and Paletuo have arrived in Shanghai, and the general market price is expected to gradually fall back.</p>
<h3>Spinning and Construction Distributes Cloth Using Flexible Prices</h3>
<p>The market price of cotton cloth has recently been affected by the rise in gold prices and the manipulation of speculators, rising significantly in the past week. Now, in order to curb speculation and effectively assist actual sales merchants, the Spinning and Construction Company has adopted flexible prices for all grades of cotton cloth opened yesterday. The supply price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth is 170,000 yuan. According to Jiang Dixian, director of the company's Business Office, the amount of each cloth supplied is based on the legitimate needs of each applying wholesale and retail cloth shop, and an appropriate amount is supplied.</p>
<h3>Leather Industry in Crisis; Thirty-Three Companies Closed Down</h3>
<p>The leather industry in this city is in a state of crisis. Twenty-three companies have already formally declared bankruptcy, and it is estimated that at least twenty to thirty companies have actually suspended work. The reasons are: (1) High cost, (2) Dumping of foreign goods. If there are no effective relief measures within this year, it is feared that no leather factory will be operating in one year. The industry has made a suggestion to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting that it find a way to provide relief. The methods are: (1) Low-interest loans, (2) Exemption from commodity tax, (3) Supply as much coal as possible, (4) Prohibition of importing finished leather and foreign exchange settlement for leather goods. The industry believes that if the first three methods can be realized, the cost of sole leather can be reduced to around 8,000 yuan, and the cost of face leather can be reduced to around 6,000 yuan. If the fourth method is realized, a certain profit can be obtained from the selling price, so that our leather industry can recover.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar prices continued to decline in the market, with a slight rebound later.

<h3>Raw Material Shortage Leads to Pencil Price Increase</h3>
<p>Recently, raw materials for pencils, such as graphite leads, carbon sand, and lead powder, have become extremely scarce. The market price of pencil leads alone has risen from 1,000,000 yuan to 3,000,000 yuan per ton, causing the wholesale price of domestically produced pencils to increase by 50% compared to the past, it is said.</p>

<h3>School Finances Not Transparent: Teacher at Guanghan Elementary School Dismissed by Principal Without Cause, Files Complaint with Municipal Council</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Li Chieh and Sha Chih-chen, teachers at Guanghan Elementary School in this city, expressed concerns during the last semester about the school's lack of financial transparency, which offended Principal Kao Cheng-hsiang, leading to their unwarranted dismissal. Li Chieh and others filed a complaint with the Municipal Council on the 13th of this month, recounting the events and appealing for protection. A written request was also submitted, which stated in part: "We, Li Chieh and Sha Chih-chen, have served at Guanghan Elementary School in Lu Chia Wan in this city for a year. We have always been diligent and dedicated, and we have been certified as qualified by the Municipal Education Bureau. Last semester, we expressed concerns about the school's lack of financial transparency and the unauthorized election of the Economic Audit Committee, which offended Principal Kao Cheng-hsiang. On January 21st, we received a notice stating that we were being dismissed due to a reduction in the school's scope. After investigation, we learned that the school's student population had not decreased, making the claim of a reduction in scope clearly false. Furthermore, the school originally had eleven faculty and staff members, and besides the principal and his wife, two others had not been certified as qualified. If the principal's claim were true, he should have dismissed the unqualified personnel first. However, the principal has acted improperly and abruptly dismissed qualified teachers like us, which is unreasonable. In order to continue serving at the school, we repeatedly asked him to retract his decision, but to no avail. With no other option, we have sent letters to the Shanghai Private Primary and Secondary School Faculty and Staff Living Security Association, the Shanghai Private Primary and Secondary School Federation, and the Shanghai Primary School Teachers Joint Continuing Education Association, requesting assistance. We are now submitting this report and earnestly request that your council uphold justice and provide strong assistance. We have long admired your council as the only public opinion body in this city and believe that you will uphold the protection of teachers' professions. We hope that you will grant our request and provide assistance. We would be eternally grateful!"</p>

<h3>Basketball League: Champion Teams Clash Last Night, Giant Barely Defeats Ren Yu, Green Forest Loses to Pei Er in Group B</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Two matches of the Basketball League's Group A were held at the Municipal Gymnasium starting at 6:30 PM last night. Nearly a thousand fans braved the rain to watch, creating a lively atmosphere. In Group B, Green Forest unexpectedly lost to Pei Er, with a score of 30 to 35, which can be considered an upset. In Group A, the champion teams Giant and Ren Yu engaged in a tense battle, with Giant barely winning by a score of 40 to 35. In the first half, Giant led 17 to 12. A detailed report of the matches follows:</p>
<p>Green Forest One Point Behind</p>
<p>In the first match, Green Forest faced Pei Er. The initial exchanges between the two sides were quite polite. Pei Er's Wang Wei-gong scored the first point with a free throw. Green Forest's Yeh Yun-shan responded in kind. Thereafter, the two sides were evenly matched. Green Forest called a timeout. Pei Er's Wang Chun-ping scored another point from a free throw. Green Forest's Yeh Yun-shan found an opportunity to break through and scored three consecutive times, taking the lead 8 to 4.

<p>Pei Er Wins by Two Points</p>
<p>After switching sides, Pei Er's Shen Pei-chang scored two free throws, tying the score at 17. Hu Hui-chao scored a basket, taking the lead 19 to 17. Pei Er took the lead, and Green Forest called a timeout, but it failed to stop Pei Er's offensive.

Green Forest's actions became more aggressive, and Lin Shao-hua was fouled out of the game. Captain Yeh Yun-shan also took a voluntary rest. At this point, Green Forest's momentum gradually waned. Pei Er's Shen Pei-chang and Wu Hui-chao took advantage of the situation. When Pei Er led 31 to 24, Green Forest's counterattack intensified. However, time was running out. At the sound of the buzzer, Green Forest ultimately lost to Pei Er by a score of 30 to 35.</p>

<h3>On Ren Yu's Defeat: Strategic Error in the First Half</h3>
<p>Ren Yu and Giant clashed, both teams harboring ambitions to win the championship, resulting in fierce competition and a tense process.</p>
<p>In the first half, Ren Yu tried using a five-man zone defense, which was not yet fully refined, and made many wasted shots, leading to a deficit. In the second half, they switched to man-to-man marking, which gradually got on track, and the game became exciting.</p>
<p>In fact, Ren Yu is a team that best understands how to use rules and tactics. Apart from its tight defense, Giant's offense relies solely on brute force. Based on yesterday's performance, Ren Yu had a chance to win. The only reason for their defeat was a strategic error in the first half.</p>
<p>At the start of the game, Ren Yu's decision to use Li Chao-ho, whose basketball skills were unfamiliar, was a major mistake. The situation improved after Wu Hsin-yun was brought in.</p>
<p>Giant took advantage of Ren Yu's confused formation in the first half and did not utilize mid-range shots, otherwise Ren Yu's point deficit in the first half would have been even greater.</p>
<p>Ren Yu's Yao Wen-yi is a good shooter, but not an all-rounder. He still makes mistakes in dribbling and passing.</p>
<p>In the second half, Ren Yu was only two points behind on two occasions, at 23 to 25 and 29 to 31. Ren Yu missed its shots, failing to catch up, which was a great pity. In Group B, there was an upset, with Green Forest losing to Pei Er. Green Forest played too arrogantly and carelessly, while Pei Er played steadily and managed to turn the defeat into victory. Green Forest players were dissatisfied with the referee, and some spectators shouted abuse. It is hoped that this low "level" can be improved in the future. (Chang Nien)</p>
<h3>Hsu Cheng-chi Memorial Service</h3>

In addition, if Hsu's relatives or figures in the sports world wish to send elegiac couplets or wreaths, they can send them directly to the Municipal Gymnasium. If they are converted into cash, the proceeds will be used to cover the expenses of the memorial service, with the remainder allocated to the sports authorities to promote the development of tennis, in order to fulfill Hsu's wishes.</p>

<h3>Record of the Trial of Tani Hisao, the Protagonist of the Nanjing Massacre (Part 2): Witnesses Testify to Atrocities, Spotlight Focuses on Tani Hisao</h3>
<p>— Nanjing, 7th Dispatch, Our Correspondent in Nanjing, Zhang Ming and Ding Kuanghua</p>
<p>Today, the seventh, is the second day of the public trial of the war criminal Tani Hisao. The audience is a sea of people, even more enthusiastic than yesterday. The windows are packed with people, an unprecedented phenomenon since the capital began trying traitors. The trial began at 2:00 PM, with presiding judge Shi Meiyu customarily beginning by asking the defendant's name, before moving on to the main issue:</p>
<p>"After investigation by this court, the defendant's troops began a large-scale massacre after entering Nanjing. Was this because they encountered strong resistance during the siege and took retaliatory action?" "There was fierce fighting inside and outside Zhonghua Gate for many days. The residents had long retreated to the safety zone, so the atrocities the presiding judge speaks of are incorrect. It was impossible and unnecessary for atrocities to occur under those circumstances. If there were any, they were definitely not committed by my troops." "All the witnesses unanimously testified that Tani Hisao's troops entered the city on December 13th, while Nakajima's troops only entered on the 14th. Then, who committed the initial two days of massacres if not the defendant's troops?" "The commander of the attack on Nanjing was Commander Yanagawa. Under his command were the 114th Division, directly subordinate troops, and my own troops. Commander Yanagawa was commanding from the front line at Zhonghua Gate, and this can be investigated. If you insist that I am responsible for the atrocities in Nanjing, it would be unfair. Moreover, due to the war in the Zhonghua Gate area, no civilians could have remained. Therefore, there could not have been any massacres. And I swear to Heaven and Earth that I never saw any civilian corpses. You personally participated in the city entry ceremony on the 17th and the memorial service on the 18th. Nanjing was covered with corpses at that time; how could you not have seen them?" The criminals consistently tried to evade responsibility with sophistry.</p>
<h3>Demanding Blood Debt, Requesting Public Execution</h3>
<p>Chen Yaodong, Deputy Speaker of the Nanjing Municipal Provisional Assembly, first reported on the investigation into the massacre case from the witness stand. According to him, the investigation was undertaken based on the principles of justice for fellow compatriots and the future of human civilization, and a "Nanjing Municipal Japanese Army Crimes Investigation Committee" was specially established, with Chen himself serving as Deputy Director and concurrently as the head of the investigation team. The investigation resulted in 2,784 cases, which were classified into ten categories based on the crimes of the Japanese army: (1) 1,159 cases of shooting deaths; (2) 667 cases of bayonet deaths; (3) 315 cases of massacres; (4) 136 cases of burning deaths; (5) 69 cases of beating deaths; (6) 33 cases of torture followed by killings; (7) 22 cases of rape followed by killings; (8) 19 cases of deaths from explosions; (9) 11 cases of deaths by drowning; (10) 321 cases not belonging to the above nine categories. After the report, he explained two points: (1) Nine out of ten of the 2,784 tragic cases occurred inside and outside Zhonghua Gate, which was the area where the defendant's troops were stationed. (2) The most murders occurred in the week from December 12th to 20th of the 26th year [of the Republic of China, 1937], which was the period when the defendant's troops were stationed in Nanjing. Finally, he stated that Councilor Gu, in his capacity, appealed on behalf of the million citizens of Nanjing, demanding that the Japanese military commanders who participated in the attack on Nanjing, Matsui and Yanagawa, all war criminals, be extradited for public execution. As soon as he finished speaking, the entire court applauded. Tani Hisao trembled during this applause, his body seemed to sway, but he immediately pretended to be calm.</p>
<p>Following this, forty-nine witnesses testified in court, recounting the horrific massacre that occurred at the time. It was truly enough to make one's hair stand on end!</p>
<h3>Xu Chuanyin Reports on Burial Work</h3>
<p>What grievances and hatreds have been buried in the hearts of these witnesses for ten years? Let us quietly listen to their appeals!</p>
<p>Xu Chuanyin, Chairman of the Red Cross, said this: "When Nanjing fell, I was in Nanjing, serving as Vice-Chairman of the Red Cross and Director of the Defense Group of the International Committee. I personally witnessed the situation when the Japanese entered the city. It was such a chaotic and terrifying scene! Their first act upon entering the city was killing, followed by raping women, then burning houses, and simultaneously robbing civilian property. The day after entering the city, Japanese military officers came to the Red Cross to inquire about our work. When they heard about the organization of burial teams, they were overjoyed, telling us that there were many corpses outside that we could collect. Thus, I was able to patrol the streets, starting from Ninghai Road, passing Xinjiekou, going over Jiankang Road to Zhonghua Gate. The further I went, the more corpses I saw, so many that it was impossible to count them. Our work was naturally very troublesome and difficult, and it was also very difficult to ensure passage for traffic, so burial work was not easy to carry out. Therefore, although the date filled in on the forms is December 22nd, their deaths occurred at least a week earlier. As for the number listed on the forms, it is also inconsistent with the actual number, because at that time, we were afraid of their power and dared not fill in the correct number. So the number filled in was over 40,000, but in reality, it was more than 200,000. The streets were full of corpses; you would have felt like you had entered an area that had just experienced an earth-shattering disaster, letting countless kind people die in any corner."</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Men Gang-Rape Miss Chen</h3>
<p>A very simple village girl, Miss Chen, wearing a short cotton-padded jacket and trousers, a light blue shirt, and black hair covering half of her face. She called out, answering the prosecutor's questions.</p>
<p>"Yes, I was raped by the Japanese! There were two Japanese men, two men who raped me in turns."</p>
<p>Someone is laughing. Are they laughing at her for not being ashamed? No, today is the first time she is raising her head to recount to her own people, she is shouting to redeem the indelible humiliation!</p>
<h3>Yao Jialong's Wife and Daughters Died Under Broadswords</h3>
<p>Yao Jialong said: "It was on the evening of the 12th. There was arson outside, and I saw it with my own eyes. They used broadswords, with handles, to kill my closest people: my wife, son, and daughters." While speaking, his voice trembled.</p>
<h3>Gui Yuan's Widow Witnesses Her Son Being Killed</h3>
<p>Widow Yuan is an eighty-year-old woman, she answered the prosecutor's questions in a very small voice. Her eyes were full of tears, she has not forgotten that scene from ten years ago. She said: "I saw it with my own eyes, they killed my son." That day, she was one who cried and complained in the temporary investigation court, who could bear it? Her own flesh and blood had his life ended by that bloody bayonet.</p>
<h3>Zhao Rongsheng Suffered Eleven Cuts to the Head</h3>
<p>Zhao Yesheng is tall and thin, but very energetic. He vividly described, "I fought with a Japanese devil like this, he had a knife and a gun, but I had fists, I had boxing skills. He punched like this, and I returned like this. For a long time, he only wounded places that were not fatal. So I beat him back, and I prolonged my life in a pool of blood. Now, there are eleven knife scars on my head, two gunshot scars on my neck, the middle finger of my left hand is broken off, and my right hand is also deformed." These are all ironclad proofs, he raised both hands, two very inhuman hands, whoever heard it would have a kind of self-comfort. At the very least, he is a hero!</p>
<h3>Zhang Sun's Husband Was Shot Twice</h3>
<p>With such a resentful spirit, she had a bellyful of words that she did not want to tell but could not help but tell. She said: "My hatred for the Japanese is so great! I can't finish saying it in three days. My husband was shot twice and died, how he died, I didn't see it, I only heard of it, we didn't have the freedom to take a look. What I saw with my own eyes was: two young girls, one was my sister-in-law, one was my friend, two young girls under the age of twenty were raped by them, they almost had their lives taken."</p>
<h3>Ke Youfu Lost Thirteen Lives</h3>
<p>Ke Youfu said: "We were a large family, but they killed everyone who stayed in the house, a total of thirteen lives, my parents, siblings, and workers, as well as four tenants. When I came back from outside, I only saw corpses everywhere, but the reason I was fortunate enough to escape was because I was conscripted!"</p>
<h3>Yu Biwen Suffered Seven Knife Wounds and Two Gunshot Wounds</h3>
<p>Yu Biwen's account is somewhat legendary. "There were six of us in total, surrounded by their shiny bayonets. Of course, we could only die. We all fainted amidst the bayonet tips, but like a dream, I woke up again. However, the moment I regained consciousness, the devils discovered me again. They added two more gunshots to me, and I immediately fainted again, but by midnight, I had revived again, and that's how I have lived until now." He opened his clothes, and the scars of seven knife wounds and two gunshot wounds were clearly visible.</p>
<h3>Chen Fubao Recounts Massacres</h3>
<p>Chen Fubao recounted everything he wanted to say with a distinctly different demeanor, very methodically: "I will explain in five points: At that time, I had already entered the refugee camp in the safety zone. But they were dragged out at any time to do this and that. (1) They drove me out to a place, I remember there were thirty-nine people, lined up in a row, they turned on the machine guns, and our compatriots fell to the ground in response, and I was told to push the corpses into the pond. (2) One day they took me out to search for property in civilian houses, and after collecting it, they told me to carry it on my back. At that time, I personally saw them gang-raping a young girl in one place. (3) They treated us like toys, pushing us down one by one, if we weren't pushed down, they would kill us, if we were pushed down, they would laugh, in this way, our compatriots' lives ended. (4) The Universal Hotel on Taiping Road, I personally saw them set it on fire and burn it down, and on the same day, I saw the wife of a photographer, who still exists today, being raped while pregnant, resulting in a miscarriage. (5) One day, they conducted another large-scale massacre, gathered us together, expressed their willingness to stabilize our lives, and asked us to state our wishes, whether we wanted to work or go home. After speaking, they asked everyone to kneel on the ground, kowtow, and thank them. Who knew that when we stood up from the muddy ground, they used weapons to escort us away. A large number of people were killed by them, truly resting in peace in the nine springs and happily returning to the earth."</p>
<p>The trial, reports, and appeals are a bloody history, a source of tears, and a story of hatred. And the devil Tani Hisao, today he finally lowered his head in the face of justice. He appeared extremely uncomfortable in front of these witnesses. Although he seemed to be carefully examining a map of Nanjing in his hand while paying attention to the times and locations mentioned by the victims, preparing for his defense and sophistry, how could the facts be easily concealed or refuted?</p>
<h3>Tani Hisao's Crimes are Undeniable: A Scene from the Three-Day Trial</h3>
<p>Crimes on the 12th and 13th: Responsibility Pushed to Nakajima Again</p>
<p>The 8th was the third day of the trial of war criminal Tani Hisao. The hearing still started at 2 p.m., and the audience seats were packed, with layer upon layer of dark heads pressing against one another. Because today was the testimony of victims and witnesses recounting the most inhumane facts of the collective massacre by Tani's troops, it was even more crowded than usual, and the atmosphere in the courtroom was also extremely agitated. At 2:05 p.m., the defendant entered the court falteringly. The judge announced the continuation of the investigation of evidence of crimes, with various witnesses describing in detail the circumstances of the massacre at that time, and incidentally investigating Tani's troops' looting of property and coercing women into providing sexual comfort in the Shijiazhuang and Baoding areas. After the interpreter translated, Tani raised his hand and requested to speak, stating roughly: According to the witnesses' statements over the past two days, most of the crimes occurred in the Zhonghua Gate area. In fact, many of the crimes mentioned in the investigation documents as having been committed on the 12th and 13th were committed by Nakajima's troops, and did not occur within his defense area. He requested that the court pay attention to the above statements.</p>
<p>Victim Liang Tingfang Shot After Falling into the River</p>
<p>At this point, the court continued to call victims Liang Tingfang, Bai Zengyun, Chen Fubao, Yin Youyu, Zhu Guangrong and other witnesses. Among them were lonely widows, grieving mothers who had lost their sons, monks and nuns wearing their robes, white-haired bald old men, and survivors who had escaped death. Different identities, different ages, all spoke in unison, painfully recounting the atrocities of the Japanese army in those years and the tragic scenes they had witnessed. Several of the testimonies were particularly harrowing. Liang Tingfang stated: "At 11 a.m. on December 16th, 1937, seven or eight Japanese soldiers went to the refugee area in Wutiao Alley, took hundreds of refugees, and escorted them to the Overseas Chinese Reception Center. At that time, there were already hundreds of people waiting inside. By 5 p.m., more than 5,000 people had been gathered from all directions, arranged in rows of four, and escorted to the riverside in Xiaguan. A large number of Japanese soldiers were already waiting, with machine guns set up. After a senior military officer arrived in a small car and spoke to all the Japanese soldiers, the inhumane massacre began. Starting at 9 p.m., they fired in batches for an hour, and then used bayonets to stab those who had not yet died. He and Bai Zengyun both jumped into the river, and the Japanese soldiers immediately fired into the river. He was hit by a bullet but did not die, and later escaped and entered the city after several days." Chen Fubao: At 10 a.m. on the morning of December 14th, he personally witnessed thirty-seven compatriots being shot. In the afternoon of the 14th, he saw three Japanese soldiers raping a woman in an elementary school in Yinyangying. On the 16th, he saw the Universal Hotel on Taiping Road and the Shengsheng Wood Shop being set on fire and burned by the Japanese army, and also saw a pregnant woman being raped by Japanese soldiers, resulting in a miscarriage. From January 5th to 8th, 1938, Nakajima's troops lured more than 700 of our compatriots and collectively massacred them. Zhu Guangrong said: He personally saw a Japanese army unit with a small flag with the character "Tani" written on it go to his house and kill his son. At the same time, six men and one woman were also killed, and he saw two women being raped. Later, the Japanese soldiers used bayonets to cut open the vaginas of the two women, pulling them up to their chests, and their intestines flowed out. Ye Yushi said: On the 14th, she was more than eight months pregnant when she was gang-raped.</p>
<p>Chongshan Hall's Zhou Yiyu Buried Over 190,000 Corpses</p>
<p>Zhou Yiyu, the person in charge of Chongshan Hall, testified that he was responsible for burying the corpses of over 197,000 civilians. In addition, Ma Wushi and nine other people appeared in court to accuse the Japanese military of killing their relatives. Tani Hisao, as usual, denied and shirked all responsibility. When it was mentioned that the defendant had allowed his subordinates to loot residents of clothing, antiques, and forced women to provide sexual comfort in Shijiazhuang and Baoding, Tani cunningly claimed: "At that time, under the command of Commander Kashii, we were busy preparing to advance south, so looting was impossible, nor would it have happened. The victims were either looted during combat, or by Chinese soldiers in plainclothes and traitors. There was no forced establishment of comfort stations for sexual comfort." All sorts of sophistry were intended to evade his criminal responsibility.</p>
<p>Constitutes Four Crimes: Arson, Looting, Rape, and Massacre</p>
<p>At 4:05 p.m., the court adjourned for a short break, and then continued the hearing, beginning the debate. Prosecutor Chen Guangyu first pointed out: The defendant did indeed constitute the crimes listed in the indictment: First, arson. At that time, Nanjing was a sea of fire, and the Japanese army did not allow the people to put out the fire, and those who violated the order would be killed. Second, looting. At that time, the Japanese army looted everywhere, taking everything. Third, rape. One woman was raped as many as thirty-seven times, one woman was stabbed thirty-three times for refusing to be raped, and a fifteen-year-old girl was raped by three Japanese soldiers and killed, with a bamboo pole inserted into her vagina. Fourth, massacre. The largest number of collective killings was over 57,000 people. In addition, there were batches of over 30,000 people, batches of over 20,000 people, and countless batches of several hundred or several thousand people. The method was to first use machine guns to strafe, then stab with knives, and then set them on fire, or throw them into the water and drown them. For example, at Yanziji, there were over 7,000 disarmed Chinese soldiers who were driven into the river and drowned at one time. The most inhumane acts were threading iron wires through the throats of civilians and injecting live bacteria into prisoners for experimentation. There were also people who had been stabbed seven times and came back to life, but were discovered by the enemy and shot twice more. All of this proves the brutality of the Japanese army. According to the burial statistics of corpses in various places, the number of deaths has exceeded 200,000. In addition to others that were not buried or not included in the statistics, the most conservative estimate is that there were 400,000 victims.</p>
<p>Summarizing the Evidence and Reports: The Defendant Should Bear Five Major Responsibilities</p>
<p>The defendant's responsibilities can be divided into the following five points: (1) According to the investigation report of the Municipal Assembly, more than 500 cases occurred in the Zhonghua Gate area before December 20th, 1937. The time and place all coincide with the time and place of the defendant's presence in Nanjing. (2) According to the testimony of lawyer Cheng Jie, there were especially many injured people in the Zhonghua area. (3) Two witnesses witnessed various units killing people. (4) Large-scale killings are collective acts, and those who participate must be held responsible and cannot shirk responsibility. (5) Before the 14th, no other troops had entered the city, and large-scale massacres had already occurred on the 12th and 13th, so the defendant was the initiator of the massacre, the main culprit. As for the evidence, there are the investigation report of the Municipal Assembly and the local court, the original burial records of the Red Cross and Chongshan Hall, and photos taken by foreigners and the Japanese army themselves. The evidence of the crime is conclusive and irrefutable. If he cannot provide strong counter-evidence, and only tries to shirk responsibility with sophistry, it will be difficult to escape responsibility. The Chinese people have always been broad-minded and benevolent, and have not taken any retaliatory action against the Japanese army, and have safely sent them back to their country, but for the main culprits, such as Tani Hisao, we cannot be lenient and should impose the death penalty.</p>
<p>After the speech, there was a burst of applause from the audience. Tani Hisao's expression was no longer as calm as before when listening to the translation of the Japanese interpreter. He scratched his head and picked his nose from time to time, and stared blankly upwards, looking extremely embarrassed, but he still refused to confess, hoping to deny the charges. He then claimed: "Speculation cannot constitute the conditions for a crime. For a criminal fact, both the perpetrator and the victim should be summoned to the court before it can be determined whether a crime has been committed. One-sided statements cannot become a criminal fact. The defendant hopes to obtain a fair and error-free verdict." At this point, it was already very late. The court ordered another debate hearing to await Tani Hisao's confession.</p>
<h3>The First Peak on the West Pacific Coast: Jade Mountain</h3>
<p>— Taipei Air Dispatch on the 20th, Our Reporter Jiang Muyun</p>
<p>The most distinctive feature of the island of Taiwan, meteorologically speaking, is New High Mountain. During the Japanese occupation, a permit was required to climb New High Mountain. Even now, a permit is still needed, but without a group of companions and courage, climbing this mountain is, after all, a difficult task.</p>
<p>New High Mountain, with an altitude of 3,950 meters, was originally named Jade Mountain. Westerners call it Mount Morrison. It is the first high peak on the West Pacific coast. When Japan seized Taiwan, this mountain became the highest peak in the Japanese Empire. On June 28th of the Meiji 30th year, it was renamed "New High Mountain" by imperial decree. After the retrocession, the name New High Mountain should be abolished and the original name "Jade Mountain" restored.</p>
<p>Snowfall Records</p>
<p>New High Mountain is located in the central-southern section of the Central Mountain Range, right on the Tropic of Cancer, its location approaching the geometric center of the entire island of Taiwan. According to the statistics of the New High Mountain Meteorological Observatory over the years, the average winter temperature is one degree, and the summer temperature is seven degrees (average winter air pressure is 481.2, and the summer air pressure is 482.5). The snowfall period is from November to April of the following year, and there is frost from September to May. A meteorological engineer named Yu Ren, who had worked on the mountain for three months, told reporters that he was on the mountain in early November last year. While people on the plains were still wearing single shirts, it had already snowed twice in the early part of the month. At that time, the snowy area was limited to the main peak. Less than 800 meters down the mountain, the snow was no longer visible. In the area around the North Peak, the snowfall period is very short, melting in less than half a day. The highest recorded snowfall was three meters. Freezing is common on the summit, and when the weather suddenly turns very cold, hailstones of various sizes suddenly fall. In a moment, several inches accumulate. On winter nights, as long as the sky is clear and the temperature is very low (the lowest temperature of the year is 12.1 degrees, and the highest is 18.9 degrees), the next morning there are bound to be thick, bright ice blocks in front and behind the meteorological observatory.</p>
<p>Because the air pressure on the mountain is reduced, many strange phenomena are created. Those who travel on the mountain often suffer from a mysterious altitude sickness—dizziness, tinnitus, rapid breathing, mucosal bleeding, loss of appetite, and other symptoms. It takes a few days to get used to it. Here, rice cannot be cooked without a steam pot, and water must be boiled, which is very easy to do in high mountains.</p>
<p>The Hometown of Clouds</p>
<p>The most wonderful thing about the high mountains is the clouds. The ever-changing clouds make people on the high mountains feel like they are in the hometown of clouds. At dawn and dusk, the five colors are brilliant, appearing and disappearing from time to time, sometimes like surging waves, sometimes like light gauze ribbons, and sometimes quietly returning. There are seventy-seven clear days in a year, and seventy days without cloud cover, with observation possible for 218 days throughout the year. The temperature range is small, with an annual average of 75% (81% on the plains). 96% of the celestial bodies can be observed (being able to see 7.4 degrees below the horizon, all of the Northern Hemisphere and within 6.7 degrees of the Southern Hemisphere). At the same time, because there is little dust and the air is transparent, it is the best place to build an astronomical observatory, and it is one of the three locations pre-selected by the Provincial Meteorological Bureau to establish an astronomical observatory.</p>
<p>In October of the Meiji 42nd year, Naozo Ihoku, a lecturer at the Faculty of Science of Tokyo Imperial University, and Shinkichi Ogura, along with four others, climbed New High Mountain and made detailed surveys of the meteorology, geomagnetism, and geography of the area around the main peak and North Peak. At that time, the North Peak was selected as the site for the observatory. It was officially established in the 32nd year of the Republic of China and has been there for five years. There is now an official residence and an observation tower on North Peak. From the official residence to the tower, there is still a half-hour walk on the mountain. In addition to general astronomical instruments, the observation tower is equipped with a radio station for communication with the outside world.</p>
<p>Meteorological Water Source</p>
<p>The Meteorological Bureau has stationed six observers and ten laborers here, who are the only people within a dozen miles of the main peak and North Peak. They stand on the front lines of nature, fighting against wind, frost, rain, and snow, and preventing the intrusion of diseases and wild animals. For each of their three meals a day, they can only enjoy old canned food. Fresh vegetables are a rarity in the high mountains. The greatest lack here is water. After a few sunny days, they have to fetch water from several miles away, and sometimes even washing their faces becomes a problem. Only when it rains heavily can they take a refreshing bath. The workers are rotated every four months and given special allowances. After four months down the mountain, people no longer recognize them, as they resemble old monks in deep meditation in an ancient temple. The laborers are all indigenous compatriots from the high mountains. Only they can climb the steep mountain paths and withstand such a special climate and environment. They regularly transport supplies for the meteorological observatory, carrying thirty to forty catties and traversing trestle roads and dangerous bridges that are difficult for ordinary people to pass even with empty hands, and they are happy and accustomed to it.</p>
<p>Slate Composition</p>
<p>To climb New High Mountain, one must enter the mountain from the end of the Alishan mountain line, through Er-Yu, for thirty minutes to New High Mountain. The mountain road is rugged and dangerous. Below is a mountain lodge, which was originally the police station during the Japanese era, built at the foot of the New High main peak. Although it is said to be at the foot of the mountain, it is actually halfway up the mountain. Geologically speaking, the high mountain is composed of a slightly metamorphosed slate, which has undergone fairly complex folding. This slate is called the "Alishan Formation" and is a Tertiary marine sediment with a large original thickness. It was folded into mountains in the middle of the Tertiary period, like the famous peaks of the Alps and the Himalayas. Because its birth period is very short, it has not undergone erosion and still maintains its original height to some extent.</p>
<p>The island is still in autumn, but people never think that New High Mountain is immersed in winter all year round, with snow that the plains have never seen and cold that they have never felt. Would you feel strange? If you are willing to climb, you will definitely have a rich harvest. The only condition is "courage," "courage"!</p>

<h3>The Snobbery of Men of Letters</h3>
<p>— Hu Shanyuan</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I heard the Kunqu operas "The Golden Seal" and the first part of "Rotten Ax Mountain," and sighed bitterly for Su Qin and Zhu Maichen. I sighed at how they, as men of letters, were neither literate nor martial, only knowing how to recite and study to death, suffering all kinds of mistreatment from their wives. Fortunately, they eventually had their days of success, retaliating against those two women and letting out a sigh of relief, which made us later generations, who worried about the ancients, feel relieved after hearing the second halves of those two operas. However, how can one not feel emotional after sighing? Throughout history, there have been far more men of letters who have been mistreated than just Su Qin and Zhu Maichen, and it seems that only they two were able to get their revenge. There must be countless others who died in anger, were angered to the point of being muddleheaded, angered to the point of getting sick, and angered to the point of having no joy in their lives. Pitiful are the men of letters!</p>
<p>However, I am puzzled. Since Su Qin and Zhu Maichen suffered so much snobbery, when they finally achieved success, they should have, in accordance with the principle of "measuring others by oneself," avoided treating others with snobbery. Why did they have to put on that act in front of those two ignorant women? Therefore, I want to say that Su Qin and Zhu Maichen were originally snobs and petty villains. They deserved to be mistreated when they were down on their luck, and there is no need to sympathize with them. Instead, we should ask about the two women who were sympathetic to them, because they were ignorant and should not be blamed too much! Those two men of letters, Su Qin and Zhu Maichen, were members of the superior intellectual class!</p>
<p>The intellectual class, men of letters, are supposed to be so refined, but they are so base and snobbish, which is truly cause for lament. And looking around, this is not only true since ancient times, but is even more intense today. Some spend all day running around the doors of famous scholars, hoping to become famous scholars themselves. Some, in public, fawn on some big shots, making every effort to flatter, to show that "the minister is deeply grateful to me." Some say nice things and write beautiful words, currying favor with people and gaining the support of certain people, posing as some kind of authority or some kind of great man blessed by fate. Some attend every gathering of famous people, and starting from those with only slight fame, do their best to win them over, shaking hands here and there, and laughing here and there, with the air of "all the heroes in the world are under my command." When he finally becomes a successful famous scholar or a great man, his influence becomes even greater: when someone asks him to write an article, he doesn't say he's busy or has no time, but says he's lazy and has no interest. Even if he writes, he is stingy with his ink, and only writes a few words. When someone invites him to dinner, he says he's busy with social engagements and can't spare the time, but when he arrives, before he's even had a few drinks and barely warmed his seat, he hurriedly gets up to leave, saying he has other engagements, and sneaks home to eat rice porridge, not caring at all. When unknown or young people come to see him, he can say he's not home, while at the same time, he has no problem welcoming those who are old, virtuous, and famous with open arms. Doctors with good sales, in his opinion, are the best books. Magazines with good sales are the best magazines, regardless of their content. Similarly, the work of an unknown writer, no matter how carefully structured it may be, if he is asked to teach, he may not even glance at it, or criticize it mindlessly, calling himself an expert. Of course, he has his own views: "Success is king, failure is villain." Things that no one wants are always bad. Therefore, in the publications he edits, there are only works by famous writers. Unsolicited manuscripts, as a rule, can be thrown into the wastebasket without even looking at them.</p>
<p>I suspect that they may be the Su Qin and Zhu Maichen of today—they have suffered mistreatment from others, so they are retaliating against others, or they may be even worse than Su Qin and Zhu Maichen, because those they retaliate against are often not the people who mistreated them in the first place. They are like adopted daughters-in-law who suffer mistreatment from their wicked mothers-in-law, and when the adopted daughters-in-law grow up, the wicked mothers-in-law have passed away and cannot be retaliated against, so they have no choice but to vent their anger on the next generation of adopted daughters-in-law, and they themselves inherit the mantle of the wicked mother-in-law. They are also like thieves who become watchmen, desperately fighting thieves to vent their anger from the days when they were beaten as thieves.</p>
<p>However, when I look at them, they are not Su Qin and Zhu Maichen after all. They may not have suffered mistreatment from others, and there is no need for them to retaliate against anyone. They are only acting out of a base mentality of clinging to the powerful and being self-important.</p>
<p>In fact, as a man of letters, one does not need to be snobbish with anyone. Who is not mistreated by booksellers and publishers? Who is not mistreated by wealthy merchants? Who is not mistreated by bureaucrats and politicians? Who is not mistreated by rogues and hooligans? Who is not subjected to all kinds of dirty air? Why insist on putting on airs and showing off one's power among one's own kind?</p>
<p>In this light, Su Qin and Zhu Maichen, with their grievances and debtors, are still sympathetic after all. Most of our modern men of letters are only disgusting and hateful.</p>

<h3>Eroshan</h3>
<p>— Shen Si</p>
<p>Eroshan was a famous Russian poet. In his early years, he visited China, but he was not clear about the practice of foot-binding among Chinese women. He once heard: "All Chinese people, including women, have bound feet." He couldn't see, so once, when Li Hongzhang, a diplomat of the late Qing Dynasty, went to Russia, this blind poet secretly went to touch Li Hongzhang's feet, but it turned out that they were not bound feet, but he was beaten badly.</p>
<h3>Remembrance</h3>
<p>— By C.G. Rossetti (Ping Chou)</p>
<p>Remember me when I am gone away,</p>
<p>Gone far away into the silent land;</p>
<p>When you can no more hold me by the hand,</p>
<p>Nor I half turn to go yet turning stay.</p>
<p>Remember me when no more day by day</p>
<p>You tell me of our future that you plann'd:</p>
<p>Only remember me; you understand</p>
<p>It will be late to counsel then or pray.</p>
<p>Yet if you should forget me for a while</p>
<p>And afterwards remember, do not grieve:</p>
<p>For if the darkness and corruption leave</p>
<p>A vestige of the thoughts that once I had,</p>
<p>Better by far you should forget and smile</p>
<p>Than that you should remember and be sad.</p>
<h3>Two or Three Things About Wen Tianxiang</h3>
<p>— Tan Zhengbi</p>
<p>The Mystery of Madame Ouyang's Life and Death</p>
<p>After Tianxiang escaped from the tiger's mouth, he supported Prince Yi as emperor in Fu'an, serving as Right Chancellor and Commander-in-Chief of Jiangxi Military Affairs. In the Battle of Kongkeng, the entire army was defeated, and Tianxiang's wives, concubines, sons, and daughters were captured. He himself was fortunate enough to escape. The "Chronological Record of Mr. Wenshan, Annotated" states:</p>
<p>After the defeat at Kongkeng, the concubine inquired about the Duke's whereabouts and rushed to protect him. The Duke ordered five hundred soldiers to cut down trees and build a deer antler barrier. After a while, several wounded men arrived, indicating that the five hundred guards had collapsed and could not hold on. The Duke left immediately. The concubine, startled, asked the reason, and then saw the pursuing cavalry lined up in front. The concubine, along with Fo Sheng, Liu Xiaoniang, Huan Xiaoniang, Yan Ruren, Huang Ruren, etc., were all captured. The concubine intended to die in deep water or a dangerous house along the way, but the road was smooth. Upon arriving at the Yuan commander's residence, Fo Sheng was already missing. Someone must have loved his handsome appearance and raised him as their own son.</p>
<p>The "Chronological Record, Annotated" also records that the concubine later married Prince Gaotang with the princess and lived in Qizhen Temple in Fengzhou, Datong Road. In the second year of Dade, she was welcomed back to her ancestral home in the South by her adopted son, Sheng. She later died on the nineteenth day of the second month of the ninth year of Dade and was buried in Dongyuan, twenty miles south of Futian. According to this account, it is absolutely certain that the concubine did not die in battle after being captured. However, in "Wenshan Collection," Volume Fifteen, "The Collection of Sighs and Laments," there is "Lament for My Wife," which says:</p>
<p>A loyal woman does not marry a second husband, a loyal minister does not serve two masters. In heaven and on earth, only you and I! Alas!</p>
<p>This text was written in Yimao, two years after the concubine was captured. In a few words, it is both sad and self-respecting. At that time, Tianxiang was again occupied by the Yuan people and could not hear news of his concubine, so he would certainly not have moaned without illness. Therefore, the Qing scholar Bao Tingbo believed that the various books recording that the concubine was still alive after her death were mistaken because they mistakenly believed the account of Zhang Yifu's search for the concubine recorded in "Records of Song Loyalists." The modern scholar Ding Chuanjing believed that what Zhang Yifu was looking for were the concubine's remains, and said that Bao was misreading the original text of "Records of Song Loyalists." The official history also takes the person who collected Tianxiang's body as the concubine, mainly based on "Records of Song Loyalists." But it is unknown that both Liu Yueshen and Hu Guang's "Biography of Chancellor Wen" both take the body collectors as ten righteous men, and the "Gazetteer of the Capital's Scenery" also states:</p>
<p>The Ten Righteous Men of Jiangnan carried the Duke's body and buried it with medicine on the roadside five miles outside the Xiaonan Gate of the capital. In the second year of Dade, the adopted son, Sheng, arrived at Dushun City Gate and saw a woman weaving silk on a stone bridge, who was the Duke's old maid, Luhuo. Sheng spoke to her, and she returned and buried him in Luling.</p>
<p>Judging from the tone, the silk weaver seemed to be one of the Ten Righteous Men of Jiangnan. The official history takes the body collector as the concubine according to "Records of Song Loyalists." Doesn't this contradict this? Therefore, the death of the concubine is indeed a mystery. Perhaps when Tianxiang was captured, he heard rumors of his concubine's suicide, hence the writing of "Lament for My Wife," but the concubine had not actually died. But later, when Tianxiang was killed, he never received news of his concubine, so the text was not removed from the collection. But if the concubine could collect the body after Tianxiang's death, she would certainly have been able to communicate with Tianxiang when he was not yet dead. It can be seen that the collection of the body may not have happened. Therefore, it seems that one should follow the "Chronological Record, Annotated," that the concubine married the prince with the princess and was later welcomed back by her adopted son, which is more reasonable.</p>
<p>Tianxiang had one wife, two concubines, two sons, and six daughters, all of whom are mentioned in his own poems and writings. The preface to "Collected Du Poems," "Wife, One Hundred and Forty-Third," states:</p>
<p>On the seventeenth day of the eighth month of Dingchou, the defeat at Kongkeng, Madame Ouyang, daughters Liu Niang, Huan Niang, son Fo Sheng, Huan's biological mother Yan, Fo's biological mother Huang, were all lost. I heard that they were traveling north from Longxing. Only Fo Sheng had died.</p>
<p>The preface to "Eldest Son, One Hundred and Forty-Ninth," states:</p>
<p>I had two sons. The eldest, Daosheng, had a teachable nature. Unfortunately, due to the Xin Rebellion, he drifted with the family. In the defeat at Kongkeng, only he escaped and saved himself. He was loved by the Taidaren, and died of illness sixty days after the Taifuren in Huiyang Prefecture. He was thirteen years old.</p>
<p>The preface to "Two Daughters, One Hundred and Fiftieth," states:</p>
<p>I had six daughters. The eldest, Ding Niang, the second, Liu Niang, the third, Huan Niang, the fourth, Jian Niang, Jue Feng Niang, and Jue Shou Niang. In Bingzi, Ding Niang and Shou Niang died of illness in the Triangle of Heyuan. In Dingchou, Liu Niang and Huan Niang were captured. Only Jian Niang and Feng Niang survived. In the defeat at Chaoyang in Wuyin, they died again in the chaos of the soldiers.</p>
<p>A generation of loyal ministers, with their families destroyed and their sons dead, reached the extreme, which is extremely tragic! The "Chronological Record, Annotated" states:</p>
<p>Liu Xiaoniang followed the princess and married Zhao Wang Sha Jingzhou, and died during the Dade period. Huan Xiaoniang followed the princess and married Qi Wang Xi Ningzhou. The younger brothers and nephews were able to meet in the capital. In the Xin years of the Zhizheng period, it was still rumored that they were living in Shazhou to support the elderly, and they were all childless.</p>
<p>The so-called following in marriage meant treating them as concubines to accompany the marriage. Liu Niang and Huan Niang were daughters of Min, and now that the country was destroyed and their families ruined, this ending was not necessarily a matter of concern. Only the Yuan ruler treated Madame Duiyang as a concubine to accompany the princess, so the official history's record of his respect for Tianxiang is simply hypocrisy. At this time, the concubine's age was at least around forty, and they were still unwilling to let her live a chaste life, and did not treat her and her children as concubines to remarry. This was precisely the cruelest means of the enemy against captives. If Tianxiang knew underground, he would be gnashing his teeth even more.</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood 168</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"I have a supplement," He Jian said with a smile, his tone seemingly protective, meaning Yaoxun. Regardless of whether they are under or over 20, this cannot be used as a completely certain proof. I myself have personally seen Japanese old ladies over the age of 80, whose legs and feet do not have the slightest Japanese characteristic; because they all grew up abroad and have never worn clogs... But I have a thought that you can criticize..." He Jian said at this point, laughing innocently, dissolving two-thirds of the tension caused by Mr. W. The air in the room was no longer so solemn.</p>
<p>"I would like to ask for some guidance on this," Yaoxun seemed particularly interested in this point.</p>
<p>"You know," He Jian's cheeks flushed again, "although they may not wear wooden clogs, but when they are at home, they cannot avoid learning to kneel and sit due to various customs. After kneeling and sitting for a long time, those ankles cannot help but change. In other words, those ankles must be flat, unlike those of women from other countries..." His face became even more flushed, "It cannot be said to be one hundred percent, there are still exceptions."</p>
<p>"Japanese women, Chinese women, or foreign women," I was a little unwilling to waste their time; "What do you all intend to do..."</p>
<p>"Yes..." Mr. W hurriedly straightened his expression, "I have made a plan. I plan to give them a warning tonight—to give their headquarters a surprise attack!"</p>
<p>"Oh!" This was He Jian's expression. Upon hearing Mr. W's proposal, he put his hands behind his back and walked back and forth in the room.</p>
<p>"Good!" Hu Chen and Yaoxun agreed in unison.</p>
<p>"After we're done, I'm going to go to Dongjiaominxiang with Brother Hu to find her," Yaoxun added.</p>
<p>I was fantasizing about the situation and consequences of the surprise attack and had no opinion for the time being. Yaoxun and Hu Chen had already expressed their opinions. Mr. W was still waiting for He Jian's reply, but He Jian was pacing back and forth, lost in thought. Just as it was silent, there was a gentle knock on the door.</p>
<p>"A letter." An off-duty employee gently pushed the door open and handed in a letter.</p>
<p>It was a regular envelope. As soon as I looked at the handwriting, I knew it was the farewell letter from Dingyuan that had just been mentioned. Receiving this letter, I hesitated a bit. I wanted to open it and read it immediately, but I was afraid of disturbing everyone's current focus—the surprise attack plan. Just as I was about to hide the letter in my pocket, He Jian suddenly brushed past me and turned back:</p>
<p>"Can you read it to us all? We are all very concerned about Mr. Wu. On the one hand, I also want to see how much of my guess is correct."</p>
<p>Four pairs of eyes in the room were focused on me and the letter in my hand. I had no reason to hesitate, so I immediately opened the letter:</p>
<p>"Senior Brother ××, My Brother—The other day, Mr. Shen came to the hospital on behalf of my brother to inquire. I am grateful for the kindness of my brothers and Miss Ji. I have also received many kinds of food and supplies, which I have gratefully accepted. What virtue do I have to receive such affection from my brothers? After the disaster, only a broken body remains, and I will not be able to repay it in this life. However, what I am always concerned about is: what happened to my wife and children, a total of six people? Who was the murderer? Where is the body buried? I am ill and my mind is blurred. I seem to remember asking my brother several times. My brothers are considerate and nuanced, afraid that the sick person will be sad, and make excuses to cover up. My brothers are also well-intentioned. I cannot rest in peace in my dreams without a reply. Fortunately, Mr. Shen came, and I begged on my knees in tears before I learned the whole story..."</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, He Jian let out a strange "Zha" sound; "This gang is really a bunch of idiots!" Then he mumbled a very vulgar Japanese curse word, which only I and Mr. W understood. Hu Cheng seemed not to understand the sentences in the letter, but seeing everyone's miserable unhappiness, he also somewhat understood, so he lowered his head very low. Yaoxun was already wiping his tears frequently, turning his back and looking out the window.</p>

<h3>The Great Feast of the Little People</h3>
<p>— Jiayuan</p>
<p>In the past few days, the prices of gold, US dollars, white rice, and daily necessities have soared. In the speculative market, with the effort of raising a hand and taking a step, big and small "lucky ones" who sit and earn millions, tens of millions, and hundreds of millions of legal tender, after work, have to be lively again and celebrate again. So dance halls, restaurants, and theaters are crowded again. Fortunately, the cost is only hundreds of thousands of yuan, which is not much compared to the huge "profits" they have earned, so they can be "completely nonchalant." However, the general salaried class is crying out in pain due to rising prices. In reality, what the "lucky ones" dislike, eat, dance to, and watch all comes from the general public. This situation cannot be named anything else, but can only be named "The Great Feast of the Little People."</p>
<p>Shops are "drastically reduced," and the doors are deserted; shops are "drastically increased," and the doors are bustling. The reason is extremely mysterious. It is truly "a thousand years of economic events, gains and losses known in the heart."</p>
<p>European and American countries attach great importance to business methods. Shop assistants must be eloquent and make customers willing to take out their banknotes. To make a deal, it is truly a "painstaking effort." However, in China, this kind of "commercial philosophy" can be discarded like worn-out shoes. Didn't you see that when the price of rice sold for 170,000 to 80,000 yuan per stone a few days ago, it was impossible to buy rice at all? Even if you had "acquaintances," you had to "beg them earnestly."</p>
<p>"A thousand years of economic events, gains and losses known in the heart."</p>
<h3>Dying for Credentials</h3>
<p>— Gu Yisheng</p>
<p>Having read the article in the tenth of this month's newspaper regarding He Fangling, a student at the Second Girls' Normal School of Hubei Province, being expelled for false credentials, leading to her running away and disappearing, I am filled with grief and indignation. I truly wonder why the government and society place such importance on credentials, not knowing how many genuinely talented and hardworking individuals they have stifled. Is it not enough to have a belly full of knowledge and a lifetime of skills as proof? Why must there be this piece of empty paper? Moreover, many people with credentials are just bundles of straw, utterly ignorant. Their credentials were not earned through learning but through time and money. They spend six years in middle school, paying tuition for twelve semesters, to get a middle school diploma. They spend four years in university, paying tuition for eight semesters, to get a university diploma. Alas, how many idle, young masters of wealthy families do we have in China?</p>
<p>The talent shortage in recent years is due to the declining standards of students, which in turn is due to the lax management of schools. In reality, it is all caused by credentials. In this environment that values superficiality over practicality, schools and institutions emphasize credentials to demonstrate their strict management and high standards. Those without credentials cannot enter higher education, as schools will not accept them, and they face societal scorn when seeking employment. Because credentials are so valuable, many diploma mills have sprung up. Although their curriculum may be tattered and dirty, their credentials are still useful. These diploma mills cater to the tastes of idle, young masters of wealthy families. They skip classes and cheat on exams, but as long as the tuition is paid, they can get a diploma to deceive the world, steal a reputation, and flaunt their status before the poor. On the other hand, decades of internal strife and external calamities have brought suffering to the people, with countless displaced and living in hardship, let alone attending school. However, many studious and ambitious individuals strive for academic success amidst hardship and adversity. But even if they have knowledge and skills, without credentials, they die prematurely in despair, "eliminated" by this "great era." It is truly heartbreaking to speak of!</p>
<p>Therefore, to cultivate genuine talent, raise student standards, and eliminate diploma mills, we must eradicate the malady of valuing superficiality over practicality. We must abolish credentials and adopt a rigorous and comprehensive examination system, so that both those from schools and those not from schools can compete fairly. Then those with genuine talent and skills will be able to stand out, and students in schools will strive for real learning instead of merely trying to obtain a diploma. Diploma mills will no longer dare to offer shoddy goods to the market. British education is renowned worldwide, and one does not necessarily need credentials to apply to university. Why does our country adopt this suicidal education system to destroy talent? Everyone knows that historically, great figures mostly came from poverty and studied hard from a young age. How many纨绔子弟 have lived up to expectations? To save these millions of buried talents, to save Chinese education, to save China, I respectfully implore the government and societal elites to urgently devise measures of assistance.</p>
<h3>A Timely Swindle</h3>
<p>— Yuan Qinsun</p>
<p>A neighbor had a maid who had just come to Shanghai. Because gold prices had recently soared, she withdrew several months' wages in advance to buy a gold ring from a nearby jewelry store. Coincidentally, the store refused to sell that day due to the soaring gold prices and lack of inventory. As the maid exited, she encountered a man resembling a laborer in front of the store, who said to her: "You want to exchange for gold jewelry? I urgently need money. This ring on my finger weighs over three qian and I was just about to sell it. What price are you willing to offer? We can go into the store together to calculate it and then complete the transaction." The maid suspected it was fake, so she followed him into the store to distinguish the genuine from the fake. After entering the store and having it weighed, the maid further depreciated its value. The man appeared unwilling and turned to leave. After a few steps, he returned and said: "My wife is giving birth and urgently needs money. Moreover, the gold store is not accepting gold for exchange today, so I can only bear the pain and sell it to you at a discount." He then took off the ring, accepted the money, and left. The maid suspected nothing. After returning home and telling her employer, the employer found it strange that it was so cheap and examined the ring, only to discover it was a brass ring. The maid then realized that when the seller turned his back, he had switched the ring. The naive country bumpkin, greedy for petty gains, was crestfallen.</p>

<h3>Various Experiments on Standing Eggs Upright</h3>
<p>— Zhu Qingtong</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of eggs being able to stand upright, the author and friends have conducted various experiments, with some new discoveries.</p>
<p>Raw eggs can of course stand upright, but some cooked eggs are easier to stand upright than raw eggs. Some people believe that eggs stand upright because the air density is particularly high on the day of the Start of Spring. The author has tried burning fire around eggs standing upright to reduce air density, but the eggs still stood upright without change. Probably this matter has nothing to do with density.</p>
<p>The author then used a small hook to remove a portion of the rounded top of the raw egg, mixed the egg white and yolk, and tried it without a lid. It also succeeded in standing upright!</p>
<p>After we removed the egg yolk and egg white, we carefully sealed the cut section with egg white membrane to form an empty egg, with nothing inside. Then we tried to stand it upright again, holding it with both hands on the floor. It only took a minute, and it stood upright! Later, we didn't even need a minute. Standing an empty egg upright is easier than standing a raw or cooked egg.</p>
<p>Based on the above experiments, it can be concluded that the uprightness of an egg is probably purely a matter of the center of gravity in physics. If the center of gravity is perpendicular to a point, then it can stand upright at any time, and this is not only true for eggs. What thoughts would the great scientist Einstein have after seeing this? He wouldn't dismiss it as "nonsense" anymore, would he?</p>
<p>Insider Old News</p>
<h3>The Recently Sentenced Nazi Photographer</h3>
<p>— Mai Ye</p>
<p>Last month, the 31st, a Reuters dispatch from Munich said: "Hitler's personal photographer, Hoffmann, has been sentenced to ten years of hard labor and deprived of civil rights for life by the 'German Nazi Purge Court'; all private property, except for a few reserves, has been confiscated." Although the telegram is very simple, we are not entirely unfamiliar with Hoffmann and his works.</p>
<p>A sympathetic painter said very interestingly: "Hitler's facial features are 'cartoonish,' Roosevelt's facial features are 'photographic,' and Churchill's facial features are 'painterly'..." The three terms are used somewhat abstractly, but in fact they are not without basis. Recalling the world political cartoon scene before the end of World War II, who was more in the limelight than "Hitler," this typical buffoon?</p>
<p>Hoffmann's contribution and merit to the Nazis seem to lie in his ability to "artistically" transform Hitler's "cartoonish" facial features into "photographic" ones. If Dr. Goebbels was Hitler's loudspeaker, then Hoffmann was his slide projector. Through this lens, Hitler deceived hundreds of millions of Nazi followers' eyes, just as he deceived hundreds of millions of Nazi followers' ears through Goebbels' loudspeaker. Compared to Goebbels, ten years of hard labor is too cheap.</p>
<p>In the common sense of ordinary people, photography is the most faithful record; but with skillful manipulation, the extent of its deception is unsurpassed. For example, Hitler was a bloodthirsty tyrant, but Hoffmann selected many shots, recording Hitler's artificial state of intimacy while holding an infant less than one year old. Hitler was a highly neurotic "madman," but Hoffmann photographed him as a solemn portrait. Germans still cannot count how many Nazi worshippers used Hoffmann's "masterpiece" as a "catalyst" back then.</p>
<p>Americans believe that the photos of the late Roosevelt were the most widely circulated, but the numbers prove that they are less than half of Hitler's. And Hitler's photos were entirely handled by Hoffmann.</p>
<p>Nazi Germany had many stamps with Hitler's portrait as the design, and without exception, these were also Hoffmann's works.</p>
<p>If we are not forgetful, we should remember the big news of the Olympic World Games held in Berlin more than ten years ago. At that time, the broadcasting rights for all news photos and motion pictures at the venue were handled by Hoffmann. He was not only a photographer and a skilled portrait photographer, but also a good filmmaker. He often suggested building a deep trench next to the track, parallel to the track from the starting point to the finish line, but only the camera lens was exposed above the ground to capture the runners' running posture, without obstructing the view of the audience and judges. The camera and photographer were placed on a high-speed car, moving under the deep trench. This plan was realized, and many shots were very moving. This news film was shown in various countries and in Shanghai.</p>
<p>But we cannot forget the enchanting actress White Braun, who acted as a line-puller between Hitler and Hoffmann. People sometimes say that Hoffmann was introduced and reused by Hitler's mistress; but there is another saying that Hoffmann often "pimped" for Hitler. Who would have known that the Nazi demon king, who appeared to be "asexual," also had romantic affairs in the harem? It is difficult for anyone to determine which of the two sayings is true, but Hoffmann's involvement in Old Hee's love affairs seems beyond doubt.
