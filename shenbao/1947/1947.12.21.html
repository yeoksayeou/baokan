<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕頃據日本賠償及歸還物資督運委會負責人稱：日本賠償物資，自日運至我國港口輪運工作，早已籌備就緒，原定海康十五日開日，海浙廿日開日接運，所有兩輪機件，均已詳加檢驗，船員防疫注射工作，亦經　妥，嗣得駐日接收委會電，以握件裝箱標誌標印不及，屬該兩輛暫緩開出，乃將海康改開靑島一次，嗣又得接收委會電，請派海康駛橫須賀接運，當再設法調海康輪定於本月廿三日開日，旋又接駐日接委會十二月十七日電稱，因盟總表示新年期間日籍工大較少，運載效率太低，決請改海康於明年一月五日駛日，預定十日到橫須賀，海浙於一月十五日離滬，約廿一日到橫須賀接運。現督委會已電復照辦。招商局及我國航商對於承運日本賠償物資頗具熱誠，參加至為踴躍，準備派遣之船隻多至十二艘，原於兩個月內可將首批九四四七件工具機統行運回，茲以上述原因，時間稍為延展，我國內各万準備工作當益加周密，担負此項運輸工作，益見易於辦理。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國派憲兵赴日一事，雖與盟總久有接洽，但迄未有正式決定，恐須待明年一月方能成行。</p>
<h3>對日戰事損失安定地區數目　限月底前呈報</h3>
<p>〔中央社甫京廿日電〕我國對日要求賠償之總數尙未提出，因我國之損失情形，調査至為不易，在安定之省市地區損失之數目，限於本月底前呈報，但綏靖區則無法調查。我國在初期所分得百分之十五中，一部分工具機九千餘件，我政府已準備足够之運輸工具，原定本月十五日起派船往日本橫須賀港口載運，嗣以日本方面準備不及，我方對裝箱標誌工作亦未完成，故決定延期至明年一月五日至十五日，各派輪一艘赴日，戰運該項賠償之工具機返國。</p>
<h3>國大代表聯誼會對行憲問題發表宣言</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕國大代表聯誼會，頃為行憲問題發宣言，表示渠等之意見。渠等均係參加制憲之國大代表，行憲之期，於去歲國大時已確定為十二月廿五日，今因政府格於行憲準備尙未完成，選舉未能如期完竣，致有過渡　之公布，一面另定國大致期，同時公布國民政府及所屬機構在國度時期之職權，現制憲國代以原定行憲期已至，為表明職責起見，特擬就宣言二項，公吿社會。</p>

<h3>援助中法義奧法案美兩院成立協議援華款供購糧食等物資</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿日電〕聞我爲配合美對華借款，將由各有關部會組設委員會，從事　劃及督導事宜·由交通，經濟等部及資委會等有關機關首長任委員。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十九日電〕國會特別會　討論對外冬賑法案已近五星期，十九夜在休會卒由參衆兩院成立折忠協　，最後表決通過五億四千萬元對中，法，義，奧四國緊急援助法案，並即咨送杜魯門總統簽署執行。該案先由衆以二百三十三票對兩票之大多數通通過院旋亦用口頭表決方法，予以通過。先是，衆院刪除　　部份後，參院原會核准四國緊急助經費爲五億六千八百萬元，其中一千八百萬元用以援助中國。據參院外交委員會席范登　稱：「中國部份必須列入，撥款委員會昨夜核准援華經費二千萬元，但依照外　案無法撥付此數，援華款項且無實施方案，現僅餘千八百萬元尚未撥付，故即以此數爲中國稍　棉薄。該款不過表示吾人之信念，蓋中國局勢與歐洲對於美國安全同　重要。」另據撥款委員會席勃里奇稱，此數當作供給中國政府糧食，小型兵器，軍火及其他物資之用。</p>
<h3>另據美新聞處華盛頓電稱，此一千八百萬元，將自美國在聯總結束後之經費中取出。</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約二十日廣播：美議員福爾漢稱，中國政府需要軍軍火較金錢爲尤甚。六千萬美元之數無補實際。縱使貸款二億或三美元，亦不能發揮多大效力，除非國民政府獲得軍事援助，包括美國之軍事專家在內。蒲立特所設想者，顯屬如此。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿日電〕孔祥熙博士廿日在此間稱：美國防共第一綫在中國。孔氏以在野之身，不願詳盡說明，惟渠相信約略估計，美國如擬以長期援華計劃完成平衡中國國經濟，則此計劃需款應較十五萬萬元為多。孔氏强調稱：此數可能被負吉計劃巾國需要諸人大量增减。渠稱：世界的安定有賴於亞洲之安定，適當之援華計劃將使中國在一年內改善其經濟基礎。孔氏稱，中國之經濟復興有緊於：第一，通貨之平穩，第二，在國內產生經濟秩序，第三，依戰前標準恢復對外貿易。孔氏以樂觀口吻稱：中國雖戰時受創慘重，然美國如子以適當之援助，中國能迅速復典。</p>

<h3>敬悼一代宗師李登輝先生</h3>
<p>— 章寒梅</p>
<p>復旦大學前校長李登輝先生，於上月十九日逝世以後，全國敎育界人士，莫不震悼。李先生的隕逝，實在是國家的一大損失。李先生的門生故舊，定於今日在江灣復旦大學開會追悼，我們亦願藉此機會，向李先生表示我們的崇敬。　　　李光生從事敎育工作四十餘年，未　問斷，所造就的人才，散佈在全國各界，對於敎育，文化，工商事業，以及政治說施，都已有不少重大的貢獻。而感人之深，尙不限於直接或間接受到李先生敎誨的人。甚至與李先生素不相識之人，聽到李先生逝世的消息，亦深為感動。曾有一位工人寫信給李先生治喪委員會，要求將李先生遺體，安葬在杭州西湖岸畔。他說，這樣一位偉人，是要永留在湖光山色之間，聽後人來憑弔瞻仰。這個建議，雖未被接受，但李先生的崇高人格所發生的影響，由此亦可見一斑了。</p>
<p>關於李先生的生平，已有不少介紹和推崇的文字，此地無須　述。我們覺得李先生一生事蹟，可包括在「愛」與「專」這兩字之中。李先生是一位篤信基督敎的信徒，他不甚注重敎會裏許多條文樣式，而於博愛之旨，則眞能身體力行。他一生所致力的是敎育事業，慈善事業，和救國工作。這些努力，都發自他對靑年的愛，對孤苦無吿者的愛，和對國家的愛。他個人過着最簡單淸苦的生活，却把全部的精力，和財產，貢獻於增進別人的福利。他一向提倡「服務與「犧牲」，而他自己就是這種美德的具體表現。</p>
<p>他所隸屬的敎會是長老會、長老會是素以規律謹嚴著稱的。李先生處事爲人，都表現出　　的精神。他先從自身做起，所以眞能收到一身敎」的效果。他對別人雖不像對自已的嚴格，但是善善惡惡，他是十分分明的。他不贊成那些馬馬虎虎的濫好人，他討厭那些模稜兩可，一切都以「差不多」來應付的鄉愿。他對於虛偽自私的行為，指斥不遺餘力。但他一切以愛為出發點，無論是獎勵別人，或是　衛別人，都是出於善意。所以眞能做到不念舊惡，不計小過的風度。因為他宅心仁厚，究竟是　過於猛，他大都是與人為善，而別人受他的感召，亦大都潛移默化，對他不忍相欺的。</p>
<p>在功業方面，李先生畢生致力的對象，只有復旦大學一校。從復旦開辦起，他就担任講席。嗣後被推為校長，一手把復且從簡陋的學校，培植成國內有名的學府。這種用志不紛，專於一事的精神，古今中外，都罕有其匹。惟其能專，他的影響反而是廣大無垠。親受他的熏陶的雖只有復旦的學生；但是對他嚮往欽慕的人，却遍於天下。這對現在一般事事都要參加而一無所成的人們，眞是最好的針砭。李先生主張每人盡他的本分。必須自己的　位站穩，續能旁及他務。他常引用聖經中的話，說「自己手上沒有罪的人，才配對罪人投出一塊石子」。意思是說，自己的事情未做好，而空口批評別人，攻擊別人，是不應該的。我們在這裏，不能不發一點感慨。現在放言高論，專門責備他人的人，是不是已經逹到李先生所遺留給我們的行事的標準呢？</p>
<p>因為李先生一生專心盡瘁於一校的敎育，所以李先生幷沒有留下什麽驚奇駭俗的事蹟。二亮生的風格，好像三萬六千頃的太湖，浩浩蕩蕩，一望無邊，而不像種湍險急的川江。李先生是一位教育家，是一位羣流景仰的大宗師，他的感人的力量，發生在不自知不自覺之中。我們以爲做一位轟轟烈烈的事業家。是比較容易，而在今日這種　　浮薄的時代中，能像李先生所遺留給我們的中正和平的氣象，溫柔敦厚的風格，眞是魯殿靈光，最令我們永遠低　不置的。</p>
<p>最後，我們還想補充幾句話。近來　崇李先生的人，有許多要把學先生尊稱為一位自由卞義者。對於此點，我們略有些不同的意見。這種看法，當然出於對李先生的崇敬。愛好自由主義的人，把自己心愛的名稱，送給一位自己所愛慕的人，這是再自然不過的。但是這樣的用意雖好，却不甚與李先生的性格符合。自由主養發源於自內思想。（free　thinking），而自由思想者，却亦是無神論者。李先生是一位篤信敎義的人，恐怕未必願意接受一個與他信仰不合的稱謂。但是李先生確是一位最開明的宗敎家，他從來不勸別人信敎，他亦最能接受別人和他相反的意見。他主持校務的時候，亦最歡迎別人和他共同担負治校的責任，他是一位富有民主精神的人。這以上種稱，都和自由主義的精神相合。但是我們對於這種稱謂，必須加以辨析者，還因為近來自由主義，已失去了它原來應有的自律精神。自由主義雖然反對外來的抑制與束縛，亦不願以抑制興束縛加諸旁人，但它對於自身，本有一種嚴格的檢討和規律。正如我國從前所謂，「人必有所不為，然後乃能有為」。假如對已對人，一味皆從寬縱，則膚淺浮濫，相習成風，實在是貽害無窮的。在這裏，我們對於李先生躬自厚而薄資於人的風範，尤其覺得是靑年後學的楷模，亦正是針對時下通病的良藥，不能不對之再三致意的。</p>
<h3>周以德論馮玉祥</h3>
<p>（上接一版）在中國動亂史上，無人曾犯有賣友次數之多如馮氏者。馮氏一生曾發生數度易主而事。為其個人利益，馮氏與中國最腐敗之軍閥聯盟，此等軍閥會使不幸之中國捲入不斷之內戰中也。目前，渠與欲使中國成為蘇聯屬國之中共叛徒聯盟。馮將軍之過去履歷，可謂為一「職業之叛徒」，一九二六年被迫逃亡離中國時，曾就學於莫斯科革命學校，隨後馮返華北，一九二七年，參加赤化中國之蘇聯陰謀。馮氏之與蔣主席聯合，係在渠確知蔣主席能打敗軍閥之時。渠雖接受蔣主席之友好合作，然隨即又反叛中央政府，而與後來變為漢奸之汪精衛聯合，組成華北之新聯合政府。在汪氏被擊敗後，馮氏退隱於一廟宇中。中日戰爭爆發後，馮氏再參加中央政府，任不甚重要之軍職。自此以後，渠參加於不滿政府之少數集團中，積極活動，此輩不滿政府人士，雖則一方面公開力持蔣主席為救中國唯一領袖，另一方面却又在陰謀顚覆蔣主席，以便獲得政權。中國普通人皆視渠為「滑頭將軍」。</p>
<h3>于斌談遊美觀感</h3>
<p>（上接一版）　今日美國人民對美國在世界所處領導地位之意義及責任，其瞭解之程度已較過去為深刻，因此在應付上亦較過去認眞努力，最近美國對華態度之轉變，援歐援華之積極化，均與此項自覺有關。　今日美國國內問題亦殊複雜，通貨膨脹尤堪注意，在生活程度日高，生產與消費不能相稱之情况下，美國人民均感經濟問題應有縝密計劃，藉使民生求得安定，在援外問題以外，美國朝野對國內經濟問題，正作最大努力。　美國對援助中國所表現之冷淡態度，過去頗有誤解為美國民意之反映者，實則此項見解完全不確，美國人民除一部份別有用心者外，大部份對中國均表關懷與同情，所憾者一般美人對華瞭解不够，然此實因我國所供給之資料太少所致，如美國國會此次對政府所擬援外法案提出修正案，將中國列入援助國家之列，即為美國眞正民意之表現。　美人十九於關懷中國之餘，對中國寄予懇切之期望，彼等均希望中國努力奮發，多作積極改進工作，藉使世界網續蒙受中華民族貢獻之利。余興杜魯門總統會晤時，杜氏曾稱：「余對中國民衆甚為關懷，對蔣主席極為欽佩，吾等對援助中國，將盡力為之，但中國亦應使吾等之援助有滿意之結果」，其意蓋亦在希望吾人應努力改進也。</p>
<h3>腐集首都難胞　加強疏遣救濟　社會部已履貝計劃</h3>

<p>在安徽以蕪湖·安慶·六安·當途·蚌埠·臨淮關·明光。　縣·固鎭·宿縣·大通·阜陽·屯溪·正陽關·由家庵等十五處為中心，並已在蕪湖·安慶·蚱埠等地光行辦理，在江蘇以江寗·句容·六合·江浦。江都。鎭江·徐州·泰縣等八處為中心。已由江蘇省政府督飭辦理中。至於首都方面，除由首都過境難民處理委會統籌負責外，並在浦口·下關·及中華門外設立難民疏導站，分別辦理。</p>
<p>根據前述方針，以各救濟站為中心，先將難民分批遣送至隣近無災縣份或輕災縣份，再分別性質，或使參加工振，或使參加戡亂服務工作，或介紹傭工，或分戶寄養（安徽習俗，於冬寒季節，貧苦婦孺可由親友介紹寄養於大戶人家），其老弱殘疾無所依附者，即由各站利用原有救濟院所或寺廟等公共塲所，或搭蓋棚舍，予以收容救濟。</p>

<h3>德和約問題恢復談判前　美決先穩定西歐　馬歇爾演說責政策</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十九日電〕國務卿馬歇爾十九日稱：蘇聯組撓對德奧和約之擬訂，以圖歐洲繼續混亂狀態。馬歡爾向全國廣播，評論倫敦外長會議之失敗，據稱，歐洲復興獲得保證以前，有關和約之條件，圖在紙上獲得協議，亦屬異常困難。據稱，戰爭已破壞歐洲之均衡，引起一種「政治眞空」，必須在歐洲重建健康之組織，以塡滿此政治眞空，方能保陣持久之和平。　馬歇爾稱，蘇聯在外長會中之行動，與蘇聯之攻擊馬歇爾援歐方案有關，因此在外長會議中西方國家所已議定之每一建議，悉遭完全反對。蘇聯之坦白宣布其對歐洲復興計劃之敵意及反對，係因復興計劃一旦獲得成功，將使同意參加之歐洲十六國恢復其國力，成立足以保障眞正自由個人機會之政府以防恐怖暴政之故。縱蘇聯官員及歐洲諸國之共黨領袖，公開預言此種復興決無可能，但渠深信自由之西歐文明將獲重建。馬歇爾稱，渠赴倫敦出席會議，原冀四强能獲致基本之決定，以解救德國今冬之局勢，改善全歐之未來。而蘇聯始終採取阻撓戰術，此可從德國賠償問題迅即成為主要論題一點見之。渠稱，蘇聯要求用目前生產品作賠償，實際即等於由美國付賬，蓋即「美國存入而蘇聯提出」也。馬歇爾又謂，渠所以建議外長會議休會，蓋目前已無法在歐洲作和平努力，業已隙如指掌。渠稱，蘇聯唯一之興趣，在利用會議作其宣傳機會，以博取德國人民歡心。渠最後謂該會並無得失可言，但問題及障礙之輪廊，巳益趨明朗，吾人在此時不能希望德國統一，而當在勢力所及地區　勉從事。</p>

<h3>利用中行機運毒案起訴商人職員九名嚴載厚等罪嫌不租開釋</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司昆滬班機夾帶大量鴉片嗎啡一案，經地檢處全匋檢察官偵査終結，昨以販賣運輸烟毒未遂幷貪汚嫌疑，提起公訴。被吿聶成山（山東烟合人，業商，住本市新閘路　園弄九號，在押），尹良臣（雲南昆明人，藥材業，住本市林森東路興業里二十五號，在押），古文彭（在逃），沙璞（在逃），莊中孚（廣東潮縣人，西服集，住福熙路第六十一弄吉善里三號，在押），呂惠明（四川重慶人，藥材業，住福熙路第六十一弄吉善里三號，在押），施珽（江蘇崇明人，機械員，在押），孫守高（江蘇東海人，機械員，住虹口嘉興路第三十三號，在押），魏文祥（浙江　縣人，機械員，住本市中正中路第三一四號，在押），共計九人。</p>
<p>發現經過</p>
<p>起訴書略謂：　·　·古·沙·莊·呂等人月由古文彭經手，自雲南昆明攜帶煙毒四包，預藏於所乘中國航空公司機中，飛抵上海，偽，　該公司上海機塲機械員孫守高取下。孫轉請同事施珽代辦，，施珽當商得另一同事魏文祥之助取出。事後孫守高施挺魏文祥等共取得酬勞費二千萬元分用。本年十一月三日，古文彭復由昆飛滬，帶來鴉片生土重三一·一六〇公斤，分裝十包，烟　重〇·七八〇公斤，裝為一包，又嗎啡重三·七二〇公斤，分裝三包，更併合捆成二大件，預藏於第四十七號機肚貨倉後之隔檔中·至滬下機，逕託施珽取下·施往見為龐然大包，而魏文祥適在假，故不敢舉動。延至次日上午，被該公司發見烟毒，存交海關，並於同月十一日送案到院。</p>
<p>販毒大老闆</p>
<p>訊據施　於本年十二月一日到院供稱：「這次烟土是古文彭帶來的」。「被公司査出來，我跑到靜安寺路第五八七號二樓二〇六號室，是沙的寓所有人監視，呌我打電話給聶成山。後來聶來了，沙璞·古文彭·聶成山，我四人商量。我聽他們說話是用切口的，稱東西為黄金九約在大束旅社第五〇二號，有古文彭聶成山。」「這一次所講的不用切口，直講是烟土，」「八日大東不開，改開大中華第五二〇號室，古文彭在循環簿上改寫陳姓。九·十兩天，　·沙·古，等在商議，　成山要古文彭賠錢，聶成山是販毒大老部品可。」足</p>
<p>佣金二千萬</p>
<p>被告　良臣亦堅不認參與販運烟毒之事，然據供係昆明人，在昆即住於古文彭之岳母家中，原業販運中國藥材，而古文彭第一次請托施　自機中取下烟土，即偽稱為貴重藥品之　牛黄。且據孫守高本年十二月一日在本院所供，五月間取下私貨，佣金「拿到二千萬，其中一千萬是到霞飛路興業里第二十五號尹良臣處拿的，古文彭給我九百五十萬元，還有五十萬是問聶成山拿的」。足為被告共同販毒之具體明證。至其本月十二日在庭翻供，對同月一日已承認孫守高向其取過一千萬，暨與古文彭往來各情，稱無其事，尤見其情虛不實。被告莊中孚以法幣五百萬元與尹良臣，交孫守高作運輸烟毒之酬勞，據供素業買賣西服，與尹良臣係買賣西服往來而認識，與尹常有借錢貼現情事，追究其何故有此業外之行為，則無充足理由之說明，其於本案亦不無嫌疑。被吿呂惠明對尹良臣本年五日因需付孫守高法幣一千萬元，曾向之取出五百萬元一節，雖不否認，而諉稱其時為九月中旬，顯非眞情，應認有同夥共犯之嫌疑。</p>
<p>三職員貪污</p>
<p>被告施　對其化古文彭起卸烟毒情形，於本年十二月一日本院坦白供稱，「以前孫守高呌我　過一次。我起先當是機上幣來的私貨，孫呌我拿也就拿了。給我這大的報酬，以後才知是烟土。」「魏文祥第一次是我呌他拿的，一千五百萬報酬中分給他八百萬元」。詰訊孫守高，據供，「古就給我二千萬外會，我留下五百萬，剩下一千五百萬，是給施珽和魏文祥去分的」。質問魏文祥，據稱，「我不知這是什麽東西，他呌我相帮拿一拿，送我八百萬有的」。按被告孫守高，施珽，魏文祥均係國營中國航空公司之機械人員，其五月所為一次卸下之物，三人均供，聞古文彭言係私貨犀牛黄，是便有藉服務機塲之機會，貪圖不法利益之行為，尙無販運烟毒之改意。至第二次施珽之行為，旣在第一次受酬過豐，顯知非平常私貨以後，且訊據該公司員工高　琛，黄毓麟，顧鎮漢等答稱，十一月三日復運烟毒之前，機場已有此風傅，身當其事之被吿施　，豈能不知。然猶聽信古文彭之支使，意圖下貨，此時應認兼有運輸烟土未遂之行為。</p>
<p>被告所犯法條</p>
<p>上述被吿聶成山，尹良臣古文彭，沙璞莊中孚，呂惠明等，核有標烟禁毒治罪條例第四條第一項第五條第一項阪運烟毒罪嫌。其中被吿聶成山，古文彭，暨沙璞等三人，並有刑法第五十六條之罪嫌。被吿施珽兼有禁烟禁毒治罪條例第四條第一項，第五條第一項，第十六條運輸烟毒未遂罪嫌，暨　治貪污條例第三條第七款貪汚罪嫌，應依刑法第五十條處斷。被吿孫守高，魏文祥，僅有懲治貪汚條例第三條第七款貪汚罪嫌，合依禁烟禁毒治最條例第二十條，特種刑事案件訴訟條例第一條，第一項，第二項，暨刑事訴訟法第二百三十條第一項，提起公訴。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕同案被吿機械負領班嚴載厚，水電行司賬施宣，施珽之房主顧紀羅，　　潘氏，因罪　不足，不予起訴。嚴。施原在押，昨晚六時開釋。</p>

<h3>兩西報不滿紙張限額報業公會發表聲明對於中外會員未嘗有所偏曲</h3>
<p>上海市報館商業同業公會理事長李子寬，為會員字林西報暨大美晚報，不滿第四期限額分配，詞訐公會，因於昨日代表公會聲明如下：</p>
<p>自本月十八日，本會全體會員大會，決議通過本年第四季紙張限額分配案後，會員報字林西報暨英文版大美晚報兩家，因限額减少，在各該報大事宣傳，肆意攻訐，其十九二十兩日所刋文字，除表示其不平外，兼載傳聞猜測之詞，更加渲染，不僅作非善意的評　，詆諆本會，措詞且涉及我國政府，暨本會其他會員，此種態度，本會不欲有所批評，本會所堪自信之立塲，以為處理此案，完全遵照正當會議手續，未嘗有所偏曲阿私，是非曲直，願付諸公論。按本會分配限額，係由輸管會限額分配處授權辦理，而分配草案通過後，仍由限額分配處審査決定，是最後權限操諸該處。假使本會議定分配方案，果有失當，是最後補救，仍有餘地，而該兩西報於補救並未絕望之時，即行公開攻擊本會，兼及其他方面，氣燄之囂張，實堪詫異。查本會所以减少兩報限額，其原因全由各該報超過加張，未能遵守規定，並無他種作用。至政府規定不能加張辦法，應為國內中外各報一致恪遵，如果是項辦法，僅適用於國人自辦報紙，而不適用於外商報紙，則非特政府無以自解，抑且限制形等具文。本會對於中外會員，向無歧視，即如該兩西報之配額，第三期較第二期增多，實為明證。如該兩西報在十一月份不加張，何至其他會員對之發生紙張嫌多之印象？在會員方面，應知時至今日，任何國籍，不應仍具特殊優越感，以相　轢。此風一啓，則其他各業公會之外籍會員，或恐效尤踵行，仍用十年前對待中國人方法，不循正常途徑，使事態嚴重之後，出以特別解決方式，恐一切公共業務，無從辦理，而其責任亦殊分明，誠恐各界不明眞相，時為聲明事實經過。</p>

<h3>刼後皖西</h3>
<p>〔本報合肥十五日航訊〕從合肥到皖西六安再轉霍山，所有公路上的六小橋樑，都曾被匪軍澈底破壞而由國軍和皖公路局合力搶修的，由於軍事上的需要，亟待恢復交通，有些橋樑着幾不够堅固，汽車經過上面，不免令人躭心。六安到霍山，至今尙無客車，途中且有散匪，我們一行八個同業，由第八綏區司令部上校秘書李雪坦率領兩車軍隊陪伴由合肥出發，到霍山的途中，國軍某師又加派兵力保護，我們在車上，只見軍車往還，商車絕無，即連人力獨輪車和行人也不像六安合肥間那樣來去頻繁，絡繹於途。今天，由大別山邊緣向山裘前進，是一步比一步荒凉冷落，劉伯誠由魯西南下進入大別山，造成的結果就是如此如此。</p>
<p>秋收已耗春荒可慮</p>
<p>汽車奔馳在公路上，　　簸　，記者此次適逢病後旅行，尤感勞頓。凡在安徽公路（特別是皖西公路）上行走過的人，都會興行路難之　。因為皖西所產的茶蔴竹木柴炭，運輸僅僅靠這條公路，運輸工具除肩挑外，就是手推的獨輸車，路面是土的，成千成萬的獨輪軍終年輾轉經過，一望盡是一條條小溝，即是石子路面，據說也禁不住長年的獨輪車碾過，遂令路面崎嶇，有如蜀道。這種負重的獨輪車是人力運輸載量最大的，無法禁止也是不該禁止的，於是只有讓路面一天比一天壤，行車有如跳舞，雨天即吿停駛。第二個問題，沿公路兩邊的稻田，至今尙是灰枯了的稻草根，已經犂過翻土的則是極少，這就是吿訴我們，刧後的皖西，人力畜力是普遍的缺乏。今年秋乾，種下的麥子因雨水不調尙未茁芽，今年秋收又大半消耗於匪手，隱藏着明年可怕的春荒，幾千年來我們農胞們是靠天吃飯，只有睜眼等待一塲適量的冬雨。假如辦匪區救濟的人做不到實惠在民，我們的農胞們將再沒有別的指望了。說起第三個問題，那是與皖西農村經濟關係最大的，六安霍山茶產，據皖建設廳統計，六安產茶面積有一一四·五八〇巿畝，平均每畝年產三十五斤，霍山產茶面積有八八，〇一七市畝，平均每畝年產三十斤，現在茶價每斤在七萬至十二萬元之向，兩縣統計起來，這筆收入太够驚人了。六霍途中，兩邊矮的茶叢都隨風搖幌在長長的荒草中，今年春天皖救濟分署曾有復興皖西茶園工作隊的組織，用麵粉鼓勵茶農中耕除草，到今天看來，那個工作算是白費的，無怪皖西茶產有江河日下之勢。</p>
<p>皖西門戶决難打開</p>
<p>國軍某師師長譚何易將軍，現在坐鎭六安，他由黃河南岸跟踪追擊劉伯誠，拖住了它的尾巴，經過沙河史河，搶渡渨河，一路上邊迫邊打，行軍千里，直　六安，當時　內正是　匪勁旅第三　隊實佔着，譚師長以三　兵力攻下了，據說這是劉伯誠所未料及的。</p>
<p>譚師長講述他對匪作戰的經騐，匪軍作戰，第一綫是少數所謂老八路率領衆多的民兵，後面排列　「督戰隊」，這個「督戰隊」由共黨黨員組成，架着機槍對準民兵，作戰時如果民兵後退，立即射死，逼得民兵再也不敢後退，原先以為匪軍勇敢，不久穿破了它的法門，除正面攻擊第一綫外，另外迂迴攻擊「督戰隊」，打垮「督戰隊」，第一錢立即瓦解，所以一路上俘獲甚多，匪軍實在經不起攻擊，其流竄性較大，這是原因之一。現在譚師長坐鎭六安，算是三個月來生活最安定，而他的部隊已進大別山東麓實施掃蕩了。（記者寳白萍）。</p>

<h3>紗花布　管制細則　尙待請示院部再行決定</h3>

<h3>似是而非</h3>
<p>— 季庸</p>
<p>有一天，朋友們聚在一起，忽然談到近日女子流行的短衫長西褲，覺得此種妝束有些不倫不類。一位朋友說：這完全是美國少爺兵造成的，他們旣要中國女人有些洋　，而又要不離「中國本位」，因而弄成這樣子。</p>
<p>我們自然不敢完全肯定此種妝束的動機是如此，不過因此推想開去，一百年來西洋科學思想傳到中國的不知有多少，然而每一種無不變質，成為「似是而非」。</p>
<p>我所住的地方鄰近滬市南區，那是道地的「中國區」，在大街上走一趟，可以看見「原子照像」，「原子皮鞋」，原子這樣，原子那樣，你會恍然大糊塗，發明原子彈的美國，到如令還不能把原子能應用於動力，而中國居然會照像和作皮鞋了，豈不怪哉！</p>
<p>一切科學傳入中國的過程大約是這樣：　亂說亂講，　亂模仿，　轉了方向專門造孽。　的例子是不必談了，原子照像即其一；　的例子更多，你到街頭看看，凡外國最新奇的工業品，除了重工業之外，幾乎我們什麼都會造，51型的鋼筆有幾十種牌子，外國新書之暢銷者，馬上就有翻板，連雜誌都不例外，牙膏學固齡玉，香皂學棕欖，香烟學LuckyStrike更維妙維肖。如此類，凡屬消耗品，學起來不費力而賺錢大的，無一不有人挖空心思為之。至於　則電機可以製造維他命ABCD，亦可以大量製造海洛英嗎啡，印刷機可以印書刋，何嘗不可以印偽鈔，我們所知道的，已不勝樓指，不知道的，還不曉得有多少！</p>
<p>中國本來是最會吸收外族文明的，也最會同化外族·近代衣食住行，幾已無價正中國的餘風存在。衣是胡服，（中國古無袴，席地坐，着袴及有桌椅，乃西域諸國傳入者，故最早的椅十曰胡床。）大餅油條是西域的饆饠，亦即胡餅，唐代長安多有售者。房屋與車輛，則近日巳多西化。唯不論如何，其中當有一原則，即是「擇善而從」。並且要做得澈底。不能胡亂學來，根本不曾消化，一會兒又拋棄了，像小孩子在弄堂中買零食一樣，這一定要影響整個健康。古人代所接觸的外國文化，也許比現代單純，故其反響比較合理而正確；近五十年來，物質環境變化速度太快，於是中國就成了慌了手脚的呆子，東也不是，西也不是，弄得什麼全不像，而又什麼全要學。結果是什麼全有，什麼全沒有，造成充分「似是而非」現狀。</p>
<p>物質如此，思想如何？張文襄雖是不大行，到底還敢於講出「中學為體西學為用」的一句話，如今我們則漸已喪失中心，手足無措，原來也處處成了「似是而非」了！</p>
<h3>鏡子</h3>
<p>— 諸葛郎</p>
<p>一個老祖母告訴她的孫女說：</p>
<p>「你不要相信鏡子　你看我罷！我照了幾十年的鏡子，終於照出了現在的模樣！」</p>
<h3>說「辯」</h3>
<p>— 董今狐</p>
<p>事情到了要辯解的時候，大概凶多吉少了，古人怕對簿公堂，就是恐一旦辯而不白，有腦袋搬家之虞；今人其實也很怕衙門，雖然有人喜歡打官司，究竟少數，而且多少總有硬着頭皮充好漢的成份，或者假着常進衙門的戶名，張大旗作虎皮，出來嚇唬旁人，凡此皆屬特殊階級，非吾所欲論。這裏談的，類屬良民，居常懸朱柏　家訓的，這些人的人生態度，大抵是少辯多讓，不進衙門。</p>
<p>少辯自然連說話也少了，據說：秦以前的人比後來的喜歡說話，故春秋戰國之世，多有辯士，後來，大概是「木秀於林，風必摧之，行高於大，衆必非之的道理，辯者少下去了，但仍不廢。再後，辯更沉落了，搖　　　，遂不為君子所取，命之曰：俗。</p>
<p>這俗的淵源，據說是由於無用而起，一無用，即最好的東西，也要淪為下流了。而「無用」的例證卻很多，出名一點如楊惲報孫會宗書，實在是一篇好辯解文章，然而並救不得這位作者，由此可見辯之無用，在衙門之中，辯更無用。</p>
<p>我是比較喜歡說話的，雖然也會沉默，但後者多出於不得已，並非心願，因為愛說，故亦不免多辮，雖然命運還好，未進衙門，未受官刑，但平常日子一個「俗」字却也免不掉。</p>
<p>讀過幾本詩云子日的人，總希望自己能雅一點，不過人的本性有時是很難磨減的，雅的門面固然重要，但到得衙門之內，生死交關，性命究竟要比門面値錢，所以寗可稍俗而全命，不欲髙雅喪生，這正是「不得已」，但也是眞性情。</p>
<h3>白紙文書</h3>
<p>— 樂平</p>
<p>自從第二次大戰開始以後，最重要的一件國際文書當然是一九四三年簽訂的聯合國公約。這個公約採納了大西洋憲章的原則，大半世界的國家藉這公約而聯合起來，駢肩作戰，而至今大家也還是憑着這公約的一點點聯繫，在成功湖與弗魯辛草地努力爭取永久的和平—總算以面紅耳赤的激辯代替了兵戎相見的局面。</p>
<p>但是，這公約倒底是怎樣簽訂的呢！却一直到最近才為大家知道。</p>
<p>那一天，各國的代表雲集白宮，專等簽約，羅斯福總統自然興高采烈，殷勤招待。一進談笑風生，大家痛快地喝乾了杯中的鷄尾酒。簽約的時候到了。</p>
<p>可是，那份最重要的聯合國公約到那裏去了呢？有幾個人說，他們在白宮裏見到過這份文書，可是找來找去，踪跡全無。主人不免焦急，於是貴客們面前的髙脚酒杯再度斟滿，而客人們却有人在竊竊私議了。</p>
<p>於是有人想起道份文書也許在國務院。國務院職堂外交，當然知道這份文書的踪跡。白宮的負責人立刻打電話給國務院，但那天正値週末，國務院除少數下級職員値班外，無人辦公。仔細打聽了好久，才有一個職員想起，那份文書的確是鎖在國務院的保險箱裏面。</p>
<p>誰能開啓保險箱呢？</p>
<p>白宮的人員拼命追索，總算找到了一個知道怎樣開啓這個保險箱的人，他住在華盛頓遠郊的一個村鎭，交通頗不方便。但白宮打去的電話的語聲已經焦急得近乎瘋狂，口口聲聲呌他立刻趕回國務院開啓保險箱。</p>
<p>那個職員說：他的確會開這個保險箱，他也極願意馬上趕回華盛頓。不過這一切全無用處。因為，這保險箱上有一個「時計機關」（Time　lock），不到星期一的早晨是誰也沒有法子可以開箱的。</p>
<p>白宮的職員祗得戰戰兢兢的把這件事老寶報告總統。羅斯福不禁笑了起來，就把這介難題老料實告訴在塲的那些外交家。接著，他從抽屜裏拿出了一張白紙，他就請他們在這張白紙上簽字——一面請求每一位代表信賴他（羅斯福），他保證他們現在所簽訂的眞是那一份聯合國公約。</p>
<p>各位外交家也笑起來，他們先後簽了字。後來，這張白紙就貼在原來的公約上。他們毅然簽署了歷史上最大的一張空白支票——而這張支票的價值如何，卻要看後世的史家怎樣下筆了。</p>

<p>— 呂咸</p>
<p>「自由談」用陳愼言小說，「新園林」用張恨水，「大公園」用老太婆，覺着海上文壇風氣大大的轉變了；因此，筆者願把北方幾位第一流名作家，簡單介紹在下面：</p>
<p>陳愼言，曾任北平京報編輯，沉靜寡言，一如其名。自京報停刋後，對外絕鮮聯絡，以撰作小說為日常工作，作品多是社宣言情一類，描寫悱惻　綿，讀之令人淚下。出版的小說，有「如此靑天」，「斷送京華」，「說不得」，「情海斷魂記」約數十種。</p>
<p>張恨水，曾任北平世界日報編輯，瘦創身軀，面微麻，滿口金牙，南方口音，喜唱京劇，筆者曾聆其演女起解之祟公道，烏龍院之張三郎。作品有「春明外史」，「半新女兒家」，「啼笑姻緣」約數十種，都是言情之作，着重書中人的個性描寫。</p>
<p>趙煥亭，是一位以鄉村為背景的技擊，對小脚婦人的形態，寫得淋漓盡緻。在戰前，曾風靡了整個華北，作品多不勝記，可惜筆者不善讀武俠小說，所有此君小說的名稱，一時想不起了。</p>
<p>老太婆（許與凱），曾充北平最報編輯，是中學敎員，以編輯學生版而享名，原非小說家。這次在上海披露的兩部作品——「縣太爺」「抗戰佳人」，還是他的處女作，故體裁不像章回小說，以北平「說評書」的語調寫作，居然另成一格。</p>
<p>還珠樓主（李壽民），是位奇特的小說家，「屬山劍俠傳」一書，其長不可以道里計，因他涉筆神奇，頗能抓住大多數讀者。有時他這部小說由甲報遷移到乙報去，讓者能够因看他的小說，也改訂乙報，其吸引力之强，有如是者。</p>
<h3>第一次做爸爸</h3>
<p>— 錢蕃甫</p>
<p>今年最初降雪的那一天，我做了一個女孩子的父親。</p>
<p>雖然我事先很望是一個男的，但這不生多大影響，我即時感觸到一種新的人類的愛底力量，激蕩着我的心靈，它雖沒有夫妻間情愛那麼熱烈，但更為自然。</p>
<p>我感動得笑了，但又淌下淚來。我創造了一個小生命，暗自默想造物的神奇，她的面目，眞有七分似我，三分似妻哩。笑過之後，我不覺淚如泉湧，我思量到每一個新作父親者肩背上加重了責任，尤其在眼前這個艱苦時代。我起了喜懼交併的感覺。</p>
<p>眼淚乾了，思索更凝結成堅固的意志——這並不是感情在高潮時的幻覺，而是一句始終信守的繫言：我將永遠維護應享的愛與義務，不祗做一個誠實的丈夫，更要做一個好的「爸爸」。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>第五章　飛來橫禍（二〇）</p>
<p>徐渚蕭一到屋內，便坐在沙發上，變手抱住左腿，緊縐眉頭，好似不勝痛楚。小王　念先倒一杯開水，請他喝下，見他膝蓋上和袖口，滿沾泥土，用手巾替他　凈，渚齋仍扶着左腿不放，口裏噴嘖喊痛。小王媽道：「徐先生，你自己看看腿上，是不是皮膚受傷，我好找點給你敷上。」渚齋果把褲管往上一扯，露出霉白小腿，隨指着腿骨，說道：「我就在這裏痛得難過。」小王媽走近兩步，蹲下一看，皮膚通一點紅暈都沒有，因道：「皮膚沒破，怕是筋骨受傷，我給你柔揉吧。」說時伸開手掌，照渚齋所指處，輕輕揉着，一面低聲笑道：「人家還說你是練武呢，像這樣的小腿，又白又嫩，有什麽勁！」說時，頭一抬，飄了渚　一眼。渚齋見她神氣很是放蕩，閉上眼睛。問逍：「誰說我練武？」小王媽小嘴一抿道：「是你太太說的，她那晚在台下，說你天一亮就起　，不是喊嗓子，便是練八卦　，到晚才回家，家裏專全不管。」隨又在渚　小腿上，微微一拍道：「像這樣瘦腿，還說練武呢！」渚齋突睜開眼睛道：「你不信嗎？因把腿部一使勁，那隻小腿立時肉緊筋張小王媽捏一捏，竟似鐵柱一般，驚問道：「徐先生你這樣使勁，不覺得浦嗎？」渚　一聽，急　起眉頭。那小腿筋肉，又鬆軟下來。小王媽手，仍在小腿上揉着道，「再揉一會，起來走走，活動活動筋絡，也就好了。」渚齋仍閉上眼請，任她按摩，一面問道「老板到鄉裏去？」小王媽小嘴一抿道：「到林局長家去了，今天老板剛回來，連屋裏都沒進去，就接走了。」渚　道：「這位枕局長呌什麼名字？」小芷媽伸手抵在下巴下，略一凝思道：「好似呌什麽福田。老板總是這樣喊他，據說是福建人，又說是台灣人，我也說不淸。那個臉龐長得可難看，扁鼻，凹眼睛，兩耳招風，三分像人，七分像鬼！」渚齋見說，也不由笑起來。因道：「老板長得多漂亮，何以和這樣醜鬼做朋友？」小王媽把頭一仰，看了渚齋一眼道：「說來老板也很委屈，老板最近排了幾齣古裝戲，必需添置行頭，為了這位林局長能帮她的忙。不得不敷衍他。」渚齋一聽小王媽這幾句話，心裏疑國完全冰釋，不由暗嘆一口氣，覺得將紈這人太可憐了。</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles in Northwest Shenyang, Military and Civilians Steadfast, Internal Tranquility, Rumors of General Zuo Yi's Troops Advancing Eastward from Rehe to Provide Assistance</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 20th] The Northeast military and political authorities and the people are all facing the current situation with steadfast and persevering spirits. After Chu Yupu returned to Shenyang on the 19th, he expressed his willingness to resume his post as Chairman of Hebei Province after the war has concluded for a period, and also stated that Shenyang is a strong city with well-equipped soldiers, and success is within reach. Shenyang was clear and sunny on the 20th, with military aircraft roaring and scouting and bombing everywhere. Military police were on high alert, and the city was tranquil. People were carrying on with their livelihoods in peace. Before dawn, sparse artillery fire was heard from the southwest, but it quickly subsided. Small groups of communist bandits scurried near Sujiatun on the evening of the 19th, and rat-catching battles were conducted in the area 15 kilometers south of Shenyang.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 20th] The northwest area of Shenyang is the main battlefield. The bandits are fiercely attacking Xinlitun, a key transportation hub. The bandits are attempting to enter the area from the north, build from the east to the south, and force their way west toward the railway station. On the evening of the 19th, they reached a point of contention for the high railway station. The battle for Heishan and Yixian continues as the National Army tenaciously defends. In the area between Lingyuan, Faku, and Shifo Temple, the National Army seized favorable opportunities, and the bandits did not dare to aggressively attack the south bank of the Liao River. There have been continued troop movements by the bandits in Liaobei. Currently, another 20,000 bandits are fleeing south to the east, west, and south of Kaiyuan, continuing to attack outposts around Kaiyuan. There is also fighting around Tieling. The bandits' Fourth Column in the south launched a fierce attack on Shahe Station, 25 kilometers south of Shenyang, and briefly captured it before being retaken. Both the Shahe and Taizi River railway bridges are being staunchly defended by the National Army and railway police and have not been damaged, but there are scattered bandits causing disturbances in the area south of Sujiatun. The Dashiqiao Station in Yingkou was reportedly captured by the bandits again on the 19th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 20th] It is rumored that General Zuo Yi's elite troops have departed from Rehe to reinforce the outer defenses of Shenyang. General Zuo is currently in discussions with the Northeast military authorities regarding military cooperation inside and outside the Pass, and his return to Beiping will be delayed. Representatives of the Chahar-Suiyuan Military慰問團, Wang Chehou and Chen Jun, carrying a large amount of慰問品, flew to Shenyang today.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 20th] Beidaihe was attacked by over 600 communist bandits at 8:00 PM on the 18th, and the railway station was also shelled. However, by noon on the 19th, the invading communist bandits had been repelled.</p>
<h3>Zheng Dongguo Pays Respects to the Chairman, Tells Reporters the Bandits are Destined to Fail</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 20th] General Zheng Dongguo has been very busy since arriving in Nanjing on the 19th, working until late at night. On the morning of the 20th, he spent a significant amount of time at the Ministry of National Defense, engaging in extensive discussions with key figures such as Vice Minister Qin Dechun (acting on behalf of the minister), Vice Minister Liu Shiyi, Zheng Jiemin, Deputy Chief of Staff Liu Fei, and Lin Weifang, among others. They also had lunch together to discuss the situation in the north. Around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, he paid respects to Chairman Chiang, reporting on the military situation and engaging in a two-hour conversation. He also presented a letter from Chen Cheng to the Chairman. The Chairman often provided detailed instructions on military matters in the Northeast. In the evening, General Zheng held further talks with key members of the Ministry of National Defense. According to Zheng's statement to reporters, he will be leaving Nanjing to return to Shenyang within a few days. The communist army's offensive in the Northeast was launched out of fear of being attacked from both inside and outside the Pass by the National Army. Therefore, they first attempted to cut off the Beining Railway. However, the Northeast is cold and freezing, the bandit forces are poorly equipped, lack food, and are weak in strength, so they are destined to fail. Currently, the National Army is firmly defending important locations. General Chen and Generals Luo and Luying are stationed in Shenyang. The morale of the National Army is high, and the bandits' disturbances are not a cause for concern. Furthermore, while General Chen's stomach ailment flares up from time to time, it is not too severe. He continues to personally handle important military and political affairs every day and does not plan to come south for rest and recuperation in the short term.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 20th] A delegation from Jilin arrived in Shenyang on the 19th, requesting that Liang Huasheng return to Jilin as soon as possible before leaving office to reassure the people.</p>
<h3>No Trace of Bandits Around Bian and Zheng, Xuchang, Xinzheng, Tongxu, and Yiyang Recovered, Remnants of Chen and Liu's Bandits Plan to Flee Back to Shandong and Anhui</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 20th] The Kaifeng city defense National Army has dispatched troops to sweep and expand the safety circle around the city for several consecutive days. On the 20th, they sent a strong force to Chenliu and another force to Hanzhuang to protect the repair of the railway between Bian and Zheng. Currently, there is no trace of bandits within 60 li (approximately 30 kilometers) of Kaifeng.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 20th] Chen's Third and Fourth Columns of bandits have fled east from Xinzheng and Xuchang. Currently, there is no trace of bandits within 60 li (approximately 30 kilometers) southeast of Zhengzhou.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhengzhou, 20th] Xuchang and Xinzheng have both been recovered. There was a slight skirmish in Luohe last night. The Pinghan Railway can be repaired within the month. Chen Yi's bandits are currently fleeing from the Zhengzhou-Bian-Xu triangle area, but the National Army has launched a pincer attack.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 20th] According to sources in the transportation sector: The situation in Queshan is unclear, and the fighting near Xuchang is fierce. However, there is no trace of bandits in Xinzheng, and the situation in Zhengzhou is becoming increasingly tranquil.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 20th] Military sources: After being pursued and suppressed by the National Army, the remnants of Liu's Tenth Column of bandits, who had infiltrated Shuyang, have fled to the Xinglongji and Jijihe areas. Chen's Fourth Column of bandits, who attempted to attack Xinzheng, has fled back to Weishi (southeast of Zhengzhou). Currently, there is no trace of bandits in Xinzheng.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th] The National Army is currently pursuing Chen Yi's bandits who are fleeing towards Weishi, Yucheng, and Yanling. At the same time, another unit of the National Army is quickly suppressing Chen Qing's bandit army, which retreated from Xuchang and Linying.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 20th] After sweeping up the remaining bandits in Hancheng and Liuquan, the troops continued to recover Yiyang.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhengzhou, 20th] Over 10,000 of Chen's bandits attacked Yancheng in the past two days. The defending troops bravely resisted, displaying high morale. The situation in Luohe is unclear.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 20th] The elite troops of the National Army, advancing west from Qixian in eastern Henan, recovered Tongxu County on the 19th. Chen's Sixth Column of bandits fled east of Tongxu, but the National Army is still in pursuit, encircling and annihilating the bandits. Chen's Eighth Column of bandits fled northeast from southeast of Chenliu yesterday.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] Chen's Sixth Column of bandits fled north from Qixian on the 19th, attempting to return to western Shandong.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 20th] The remnants of Liu's Second Column of bandits, who originally broke through from north of Jingfu towards Gushi, were forced by the National Army's four-pronged blockade and suppression over the past few days to flee back towards Lihuang (near Kaishunjie) on the 19th. The National Army in Lihuang is cooperating with local militias to suppress the bandits.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle for Yuncheng Outskirts in Southern Shanxi</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 20th] Fierce fighting has broken out in the outskirts of Yuncheng. The northeast corner of the flour company outside the north gate was destroyed by bandit artillery fire, and there is intense fighting for various outposts in the suburbs. It is rumored that three columns of bandits are advancing towards Yuncheng from Shunde, Tanqu, Wenxi, and Xiaxian.</p>
<h3>The Pingjinbao Triangle Area Enters a Period of Pacification</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 20th] The main forces of the bandit columns in Hebei Province have gathered on both sides of the Ping-Shi Road for reorganization and replenishment. The National Army's new deployment has been completed, and the sweeping and suppressing corps has launched proactive offensives along the Jin-Bao Highway for several consecutive days. The Pingjinbao Triangle area has entered a period of pacification. The Daqing River is heavily guarded by the National Army to prevent bandits from fleeing north.</p>
<h3>Authorities Order Feng Yuxiang to Return to the Country for Water Conservancy Inspection, Special Envoy Title Revoked, Zhou Yide Calls Feng a "Slippery General"</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 20th] Feng Yuxiang was ordered to go to the United States last year to inspect water conservancy. Recently, as the mission has been completed, the government has ordered him to return to the country by the end of the year and has instructed our embassies and consulates in the United States to verify and relay the message.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Feng Yuxiang, who was appointed to go to the United States to inspect water conservancy, has had his special envoy title revoked by the authorities, and he has been ordered to return to the country. According to informed sources, Feng Yuxiang was sent to the United States on April 27, 1946, with the government generously providing funds and allowing him to bring staff. However, since arriving in the United States, nearly a year has passed, and he has not only neglected his inspection mission and failed to submit a single report, but also, as a government official, made anti-government speeches and actions, issued excessive writings, and formed unauthorized groups, which is absurd and ridiculous and tarnishes his official position. Therefore, the authorities have made the above decision to terminate his inspection mission.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Congressman Zhou Yide called Feng Yuxiang a "slippery general." He stated on the 19th that the Chinese "Christian General" Feng Yuxiang's speeches in the United States attacking the Chinese Nationalist government violate the meaning of American preferential treatment. Zhou Yide told the House that General Feng is cooperating with the Communist Party to undermine the credibility of the current government in the hope of restoring his former power as a warlord in China. General Feng is currently making fierce and disloyal attacks on the Republic of China. General Feng made a speech at a meeting hosted by the American Democratic Far East Policy Committee, an organization that has long been identified as a well-known Communist front organization aimed at carrying out activities to persuade us to abandon China.

<h3>Severe Damage to the Pinghan Railway, Director Xia Guangyu Bitterly Narrates the Communist Bandits' Cruel Methods</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 20th] Xia Guangyu, Director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, invited reporters from Nanjing and Shanghai in the afternoon of the 20th to bitterly narrate the tragic situation of the Communist bandits' destruction of the railway. According to him, the damaged railway can be divided into three sections: the northern section from Xiaolizhuang (south of Zhengzhou) to Mengmiaocun, with 118 kilometers destroyed; the middle section, 30 kilometers south of Queshan, completely destroyed; and the southern section from Wangjiadian to Huayuan, with 15 kilometers destroyed, totaling 253 kilometers of the entire southern section of the Pinghan Railway destroyed. At least 100 kilometers of this section must be rebuilt. Approximately a dozen military stations were burned, three large railway bridges and a dozen small railway bridges were destroyed, and 140 passenger cars and 160 locomotives were either destroyed or lost. Overall, the Communist bandits' destructive methods were crueler than those of the enemy. The damage between Xuchang and Yancheng was particularly severe, which is infuriating. However, it is gratifying that, as a result of the staff's rescue efforts, over 700 locomotives and freight cars have been transported to the south of Xinyang, and over 24,000 tons of grain have been recovered. Currently, in addition to the Xin-Han section operating as usual, transportation cars can also reach Minggang north of Xinyang. The repairs to other sections will require at least 100 billion yuan, and a request for funds is being sent to the ministry.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Zhengzhou, 19th] Zhengzhou Pinghan Railway is short of coal on both lines. The Zheng-Xin section will temporarily suspend passenger and freight trains from the 18th. The railway bureau is stepping up its efforts to purchase coal and find ways to resume traffic.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 20th] The review of the list of legislative committee candidates nominated by political parties was 90% complete on the 20th. According to Zhang Shou-xian, secretary of the Central Committee, this completed list was sent to the General Election Headquarters on the evening of the 20th, but it will not be announced until it has been reviewed and verified. The lists of the Democratic and Youth parties may be announced on the 21st. The Nationalist Party has not yet made final decisions on some candidates for the eight northeastern provinces, two cities, Hebei Province, the first district of Shaanxi Province, Xijing City, and Nanjing City, which will be decided after a small group meeting on the 22nd. According to Beijing and Shanghai are both free election areas, and the list for Shanghai was approved on the 20th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 20th] Shanghai has decided to adopt a free election method for the legislative elections. The number of candidates nominated by political parties is doubled according to the number of people to be elected, totaling fourteen. The list was approved by the Central Election 指導委員會 on the 20th.

<h3>General Election Headquarters Orders Expedited Voting for National Assembly Representatives in Pacification Areas</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] December 23rd is the final voting date for the election of National Assembly representatives in the pacification areas. The General Election Headquarters held its seventeenth election committee meeting today and decided to order all localities to expedite the voting. Regarding the political party nominations for National Assembly representatives in Shandong and Shanxi provinces, the General Election Headquarters also decided to telegraph the election offices in the two provinces today to announce them separately. The meeting today was chaired by Zhang Lisheng, and over ten people, including Jiang Yuntian and Liu Dongyan, attended.</p>
<h3>Number of Elected National Assembly Representatives Reported to the General Election Headquarters</h3>
<p>Reaches 1,841</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] As of the evening of the 20th, the number of elected National Assembly representatives who have reported to the General Election Headquarters has reached 1,842. According to Zhang Lisheng, chairman of the General Election Headquarters, if the number of representatives reported reaches 2,031, it will be sufficient to reach one-third of the total number of representatives, and a request can be submitted to the National Government to issue an order to convene the National Assembly. The provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, among others, have already reported all elected representatives. A small number of elected representatives from Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces have not yet reported. It is expected that the number of representatives required to convene the meeting will be reported within one or two days, and the National Government can then issue a clear order specifying the date of the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>Postponement of Shipment of Reparations, Preparations Become More Thorough, Dispatch of Military Police to Japan May Have to Wait Until Next Year</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 20th] According to the person in charge of the Japan Reparations and Returned Materials Supervision Committee, the work of transporting Japanese reparations materials from Japan to our country's ports by ship has long been prepared. The Hai康 was originally scheduled to depart on the 15th and the Hai浙 on the 20th for collection. All parts of the two ships have been thoroughly inspected, and the crew's vaccination work has also been properly completed. Later, a telegram was received from the Acceptance Committee stationed in Japan stating that the marking of the parts' packaging was insufficient, and the two ships were temporarily postponed. The Hai康 was then changed to make a trip to Qingdao, but later another telegram was received from the stationed Acceptance Committee requesting that the Hai康 be sent to Yokosuka for collection. An attempt was made to arrange for the Hai康 to depart for Japan on the 23rd of this month, but then another telegram was received from the Acceptance Committee stationed in Japan on December 17 stating that the Allied Headquarters indicated that there would be fewer Japanese workers during the New Year period, and the transportation efficiency would be too low. It was decided to change the Hai康 to depart for Japan on January 5 next year, with an estimated arrival in Yokosuka on the 10th, and the Hai浙 to leave Shanghai on January 15, with an estimated arrival in Yokosuka on the 21st. The Supervision Committee has now telegraphed back to comply. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and our country's shipping companies are very enthusiastic about undertaking the transportation of Japanese reparations materials and have participated actively. The number of ships prepared to be dispatched is as high as twelve. Originally, the first batch of 9,447 machine tools could be transported back in two months, but due to the above reasons, the time has been slightly extended. The preparations in our country should become more thorough, and the task of undertaking this transportation should become easier to manage.</p>
<p>[News from our publication] Although there have been long-standing contacts with the Allied Headquarters regarding the dispatch of our country's military police to Japan, no formal decision has been made to date, and it may have to wait until January next year to be realized.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Submitting Number of Stable Areas Suffering Losses in the War Against Japan: End of This Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The total amount of reparations demanded by our country from Japan has not yet been submitted because the investigation of the extent of our country's losses is very difficult. The number of losses in stable provinces and cities must be submitted by the end of this month, but it is impossible to investigate in pacification areas. Of the 15% initially allocated to our country, some of the machine tools, over 9,000 pieces, are enough for our government to prepare transportation tools. Originally scheduled to send ships to Yokosuka port in Japan from the 15th of this month, but due to insufficient preparations on the Japanese side and incomplete marking of the boxes on our side, it was decided to postpone it to January 5th to 15th next year, with each ship sent to Japan to transport the reparations of machine tools back home.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Representatives' Fellowship Issues Declaration on Constitutional Government Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 20th] The National Assembly Representatives' Fellowship recently issued a declaration on the issue of constitutional government, expressing their opinions. They are all National Assembly representatives who participated in the drafting of the constitution. The date for the implementation of constitutional government was determined to be December 25th at last year's National Assembly. Now, because the government believes that preparations for the implementation of constitutional government have not been completed, and elections have not been completed as scheduled, a transitional period has been announced, and a National Assembly date has been set, while announcing the powers of the National Government and its affiliated institutions during the National Assembly period. As the original scheduled date for the implementation of constitutional government has arrived, the constituent National Assembly representatives have prepared two declarations to inform society in order to demonstrate their responsibilities.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, this city] The Archbishop returned to the country after visiting the United States for two months and arrived in Shanghai by plane at 3:00 PM on the 20th. He is scheduled to go to Beijing today. According to his impressions of the trip, "My trip to the United States was purely in a private capacity as a goodwill visit. I had extensive discussions with President Truman, congressional leaders, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and other friends. I also visited news, broadcasting, industrial and commercial enterprises, and important water conservancy facilities, and gave lectures to various academic groups. What I have seen and heard has provided much food for thought. As for the impressions of this trip, they can be divided into the following points:" (Continued on page 2, column 1)</p>
<h3>We Decide to First Send a Special Envoy to Congratulate Myanmar's Independence</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 20th] Myanmar is scheduled to formally become independent on January 4th next year. Our country has decided to first send a special envoy to congratulate them and participate in the grand ceremony. The candidate for this position has been internally determined and will be announced within the next week. As for our first ambassador to Myanmar, Xu Yuntan, is currently on his way back from the United States and will arrive in Beijing soon to pay respects to the authorities for instructions and plan for the establishment of the embassy.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congressional Committees Reach Agreement on Aid to China, France, Italy, and Austria Bills, Aid to China Funds Used to Purchase Grain and Other Materials</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 20th] It is reported that in order to cooperate with the U.S. loan to China, a committee will be established by the relevant ministries and commissions to engage in planning and guidance. The heads of the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the National Resources Commission will serve as committee members.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] The special session of Congress, which had been discussing the foreign winter relief bill for nearly five weeks, finally reached a compromise agreement between the House and Senate on the 19th and passed a $540 million emergency aid bill for China, France, Italy, and Austria, which was immediately sent to President Truman for signature and implementation. The bill was first passed by the House with a large majority of 233 votes to 2, and then also passed by the Senate with a voice vote. Previously, after the House deleted certain parts, the Senate originally approved $568 million in emergency aid to the four countries, of which $18 million was used to aid China. According to Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, "The China portion must be included. The Appropriations Committee approved $20 million in aid to China last night, but this amount cannot be allocated according to foreign legislation. There is no implementation plan for the aid to China funds, and only $18 million remains unallocated, so this amount is being used to provide China with a small amount of assistance. This sum merely represents our belief that the situation in China is as important to American security as the situation in Europe." According to Senator Bridges, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, this amount will be used to provide the Chinese government with food, small arms, ammunition, and other materials.</p>
<h3>According to a U.S. Information Agency dispatch from Washington, this $18 million will be taken from the funds of the U.S. after the end of the UNRRA.</h3>
<p>[News from our publication] New York, 20th, Broadcast: U.S. Congressman Fulhan stated that the Chinese government needs ammunition more than money. The amount of $60 million is not helpful. Even if a loan of $200 million or $300 million is made, it will not be very effective unless the National Government receives military assistance, including American military experts. What Bullitt envisioned is clearly this.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Dr. H.H. Kung stated here on the 20th that the first line of U.S. anti-communism is in China. Dr. Kung, in his capacity as a private citizen, was unwilling to elaborate, but he believed that, roughly estimated, the U.S. would need more than $150 billion to complete the long-term aid plan to China to balance China's economy. Dr. Kung emphasized that this number may be greatly increased or decreased by those who demand China's needs in the Gooding program. He said that the stability of the world depends on the stability of Asia, and that an appropriate aid plan to China will enable China to improve its economic foundation within a year. Dr. Kung said that China's economic revival depends on: first, currency stability; second, the creation of economic order within the country; and third, the restoration of foreign trade to pre-war standards. Dr. Kung said optimistically that although China was severely damaged during the war, China could quickly recover if the United States provides it with appropriate assistance.</p>

<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>In Memory of a Great Master, Mr. Li Denghui</h3>
<p>— Zhang Hanmei</p>
<p>Following the passing of former Fudan University President Mr. Li Denghui on the 19th of last month, educators across the nation were deeply saddened. Mr. Li's death is truly a great loss to the country. Mr. Li's students and old friends are scheduled to hold a memorial meeting at Jiangwan Fudan University today, and we would also like to take this opportunity to express our respect for Mr. Li. Mr. Li devoted himself to education for more than forty years without interruption. The talents he cultivated are scattered throughout all sectors of the country, and they have made significant contributions to education, culture, commerce, industry, political reforms, and so on. His profound impact is not limited to those who directly or indirectly received his teachings. Even those who did not know Mr. Li personally were deeply moved upon hearing of his death. A worker even wrote a letter to Mr. Li's funeral committee, requesting that Mr. Li's remains be buried on the banks of West Lake in Hangzhou. He said that such a great man should be forever remembered amidst the scenic beauty of the lake and mountains, for future generations to pay their respects. Although this suggestion was not accepted, the influence of Mr. Li's noble character can be seen from this.</p>
<p>There have been many introductions and praises of Mr. Li's life, which need not be repeated here. We believe that Mr. Li's life can be summarized by the words "love" and "dedication." Mr. Li was a devout Christian believer. He did not pay much attention to the many rules and formalities of the church, but he was truly able to practice the doctrine of universal love. Throughout his life, he devoted himself to education, charity, and national salvation. These efforts stemmed from his love for young people, his love for the orphaned and helpless, and his love for the country. He personally lived a simple and frugal life, but he contributed all his energy and property to improving the welfare of others. He always advocated "service" and "sacrifice," and he himself was the embodiment of these virtues.</p>
<p>The church he belonged to was the Presbyterian Church, which is known for its strict discipline. Mr. Li demonstrated this spirit in his conduct and dealings. He started with himself, so he was truly able to achieve the effect of "teaching by example." Although he was not as strict with others as he was with himself, he had a clear distinction between right and wrong. He did not approve of those who were merely easygoing and indiscriminate, and he disliked those who were ambiguous and dealt with everything with a "good enough" attitude. He spared no effort in criticizing hypocritical and selfish behavior. However, everything he did was based on love. Whether it was rewarding others or defending others, it was out of good intentions. Therefore, he was truly able to achieve the demeanor of not dwelling on past wrongs and not being concerned about minor faults. Because he was kind and generous, he was ultimately more lenient than harsh. He mostly sought to get along with others, and others were influenced by him, mostly imperceptibly, and could not bear to deceive him.</p>
<p>In terms of career achievements, Mr. Li devoted his entire life to only one school, Fudan University. He served as a lecturer from the very beginning of Fudan's establishment. Later, he was promoted to president and single-handedly cultivated Fudan from a simple school into a famous university in the country. This spirit of focusing one's mind and dedicating oneself to one thing is rare in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Precisely because he was able to dedicate himself, his influence was vast and boundless. Although only Fudan students were directly influenced by him, those who admired and respected him were all over the world. This is truly the best criticism for those who nowadays want to participate in everything but achieve nothing. Mr. Li advocated that everyone should do their duty. One must first stand firmly in one's own position before being able to extend to other tasks. He often quoted a saying from the Bible, saying, "Only those who have no sin on their own hands are qualified to throw a stone at a sinner." He meant that it is not right to criticize and attack others without doing one's own job well. We cannot help but feel a sense of regret here. Are those who now speak freely and specialize in blaming others meeting the standards of conduct that Mr. Li left us?</p>
<p>Because Mr. Li devoted his life to education at one school, he did not leave behind any startling or shocking deeds. Mr. Li's style is like the vast Tai Lake, boundless and endless at 36,000 hectares, rather than a turbulent and rapid river. Mr. Li was an educator, a great master admired by all. His inspiring power arose unconsciously and imperceptibly. We believe that it is relatively easy to be a sensational careerist, but in today's superficial era, to be able to emulate Mr. Li's legacy of neutrality and peace, and his gentle and kind style, is truly a rare and precious thing, worthy of our eternal respect.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to add a few more words. Recently, many who admire Mr. Li want to respectfully call him a liberal. On this point, we have slightly different opinions. This view, of course, stems from respect for Mr. Li. It is only natural for lovers of liberalism to give their beloved title to someone they admire. However, although the intention is good, it does not quite match Mr. Li's personality. Liberalism originates from free thinking, and free thinkers are also atheists. Mr. Li was a devout believer in Christianity, and he probably would not want to accept a title that is incompatible with his beliefs. However, Mr. Li was indeed a most enlightened religious figure. He never persuaded others to believe in his religion, and he was most able to accept opinions that were contrary to his own. When he was in charge of school affairs, he also welcomed others to share the responsibility of running the school with him. He was a person with a strong democratic spirit. All of these aspects are in line with the spirit of liberalism. However, we must analyze this title because in recent times, liberalism has lost its original spirit of self-discipline. Although liberalism opposes external suppression and restraint, it also does not want to impose suppression and restraint on others, but it has a strict self-examination and discipline for itself. Just as our country used to say, "People must have things they will not do, and then they can do things." If one is always lenient to oneself and others, then superficiality and laxity will become a common practice, which is truly infinitely harmful. Here, we feel that Mr. Li's style of being demanding of himself and generous to others is especially a model for young students, and it is also a good remedy for the common diseases of the present time, and we cannot help but pay our respects to it again and again.</p>
<h3>Zhou Yide on Feng Yuxiang</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) In the history of Chinese turmoil, no one has committed as many acts of betrayal as Feng. Throughout his life, Feng has changed masters several times. For his own personal gain, Feng allied himself with the most corrupt warlords in China, warlords who plunged the unfortunate country into continuous civil war. Currently, he is allied with the CCP traitors who want to make China a Soviet satellite state. General Feng's past record can be described as that of a "professional traitor." In 1926, when he was forced to flee China, he studied at the Moscow Revolutionary School. Subsequently, Feng returned to North China, and in 1927, he participated in the Soviet conspiracy to communize China. Feng's alliance with President Chiang Kai-shek was when he was sure that President Chiang could defeat the warlords. Although he accepted President Chiang's friendly cooperation, he immediately rebelled against the central government and joined forces with Wang Jingwei, who later became a traitor, to form a new united government in North China. After Wang was defeated, Feng retired to a temple. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Feng rejoined the central government and held an insignificant military position. Since then, he has been actively involved in a small group of people who were dissatisfied with the government. These dissatisfied people, while publicly supporting President Chiang as the only leader to save China, were secretly plotting to overthrow President Chiang in order to gain power. Ordinary Chinese people view him as a "slippery general."</p>
<h3>Yu Bin Talks About His Impressions of Traveling in the United States</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Today, the American people have a deeper understanding of the meaning and responsibility of America's leading position in the world than in the past. Therefore, they are more serious and effortful in dealing with it than in the past. The recent changes in the United States' attitude towards China and the active support for Europe and China are all related to this awareness. Today, domestic problems in the United States are also very complicated. Inflation is particularly noteworthy. In a situation where the standard of living is rising daily and production and consumption are not commensurate, the American people feel that economic problems should be carefully planned so that people's livelihoods can be stabilized. In addition to foreign aid issues, the American government and the public are making the greatest efforts on domestic economic issues. The indifferent attitude shown by the United States towards assisting China has been misunderstood in the past as a reflection of American public opinion. In fact, this view is completely inaccurate. Most Americans, except for a few with ulterior motives, are concerned about and sympathize with China. The pity is that the general American understanding of China is insufficient, but this is actually due to the fact that the information provided by our country is too little. For example, the US Congress's recent amendment to the government's proposed foreign aid bill, which included China as a recipient country, is a manifestation of the true American public opinion. After caring about China, the Americans place earnest expectations on China. They all hope that China will strive to improve and make more active improvements so that the world will continue to benefit from the contributions of the Chinese nation. When I met with President Truman, he said: "I am very concerned about the Chinese people and admire President Chiang very much. We will do our best to help China, but China should also make our assistance have satisfactory results." His intention is also to hope that we should work hard to improve.</p>
<h3>Refugees Gather in the Capital; Intensify Evacuation and Relief; Ministry of Social Affairs Has Implemented a Plan</h3>
<p>[Nanjing, Central News Agency, 20th] The number of refugees successively arriving in Nanjing due to bandit disasters is increasing daily. They are living in Xiaguan in a miserable state. To provide relief to the refugees, the Ministry of Social Affairs has now formulated a plan. The guiding principle is to send them back to their hometowns and strengthen local relief in each province as a principle. According to this principle, refugees coming to Beijing from Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces will be sent back to their provinces as much as possible. In safe and moderate areas within each province, refugee relief stations will be set up separately to effectively strengthen local relief and resettlement to avoid the suffering of refugees wandering around. Refugees who have already arrived in Beijing and are indeed suffering from cold and hunger will still be given appropriate assistance. Shelters and porridge distribution centers have now been established in Puzhen to provide temporary relief.</p>
<p>In Anhui, Wuhu, Anqing, Liuan, Dangtu, Bengbu, Linhuaiguan, Mingguang, County, Guzhen, Suxian, Datong, Fuyang, Tunxi, Zhengyangguan, and Youjia'an are the centers, and they have already been implemented in Wuhu, Anqing, and Zhapu. In Jiangsu, Jiangning, Jurong, Liuhe, Jiangpu, Jiangdu, Zhenjiang, Xuzhou, and Taixian are the centers. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has instructed them to be implemented. As for the capital, in addition to the Refugee Diversion and Treatment Committee of the capital taking overall responsibility, refugee diversion stations will be set up in Pukou, Xiaguan, and outside Zhonghua Gate to handle them separately.</p>
<p>According to the aforementioned guidelines, with each relief station as the center, refugees will first be sent in batches to neighboring disaster-free or lightly disaster-stricken counties. Then, according to their nature, they will be made to participate in work relief, participate in anti-rebellion service work, be introduced to work as servants, or be fostered in separate households (in Anhui customs, in the cold winter season, poor women and children can be introduced by relatives and friends to be fostered in wealthy families). The elderly, weak, disabled, and those who have no support will be accommodated and rescued by each station using the original relief homes, temples, and other public places, or by building sheds.</p>

He called on all ethnic groups in the province to cooperate with government policies and strive to build a new Xinjiang based on the Three Principles of the People. Finally, delegate Hami delivered a speech, expressing the future direction of the association's efforts: Absolutely guarantee the integrity of the country's territorial sovereignty. Unite the 14 ethnic groups to complete the various construction plans in the administrative program. Crush all sabotage plots by those who sow discord. Since the association opened on the 1st, it has been the 19th today, and hundreds of proposals have been discussed, most of which are construction issues. All proposals have been sent to the government for adoption and implementation.</p>

<h3>Thai Rice Mills Nationalized; Overseas Chinese Businessmen Seek Rescue Measures</h3>

From today, all railways and inland waterway vessels will stop serving any private rice mills.

<h3>Before Resuming Negotiations on the German Peace Treaty, the US Decides to Stabilize Western Europe First; Marshall's Speech Criticizes Soviet Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] Secretary of State Marshall stated on the 19th that the Soviet Union is obstructing the drafting of peace treaties with Germany and Austria in an attempt to keep Europe in a state of chaos. Marshall addressed the nation in a broadcast commenting on the failure of the London Foreign Ministers Conference. He said that it would be extremely difficult to reach an agreement on the terms of the peace treaties on paper before European recovery is guaranteed. He said that the war has destroyed the balance of Europe, creating a "political vacuum" that must be filled by rebuilding a healthy structure in Europe in order to ensure lasting peace. Marshall stated that the Soviet Union's actions at the Foreign Ministers Conference were related to the Soviet Union's attack on the Marshall Plan for European aid, and therefore every proposal agreed upon by the Western countries at the Foreign Ministers Conference was completely opposed. The Soviet Union's open declaration of its hostility and opposition to the European recovery plan is because once the recovery plan is successful, it will allow the sixteen European countries that agree to participate to restore their national strength and establish governments that can guarantee genuine freedom and individual opportunities to prevent terror and tyranny. Although Soviet officials and communist leaders in European countries have publicly predicted that this recovery will be impossible, he is convinced that the free civilization of Western Europe will be rebuilt. Marshall stated that he went to London to attend the conference, hoping that the four powers could reach a basic decision to resolve Germany's situation this winter and improve the future of all of Europe. However, the Soviet Union consistently adopted obstructionist tactics, which can be seen from the fact that the issue of German reparations quickly became a major topic. He said that the Soviet Union's demand for reparations to be paid in current production is actually equivalent to the United States paying the bill, that is, "the United States deposits and the Soviet Union withdraws." Marshall also said that the reason he suggested the Foreign Ministers Conference be adjourned is that it is now clear that it is impossible to make peaceful efforts in Europe. He said that the Soviet Union's only interest is to use the conference as an opportunity for propaganda to win the favor of the German people. He concluded that the conference had neither gains nor losses, but the outlines of the problems and obstacles have become clearer. We cannot hope for German unification at this time, but should do our best in the areas within our reach.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 20th] Marshall's broadcast speech shows that he has placed all his hopes for resolving the German peace treaty issue on the success of the European Recovery Program. He further clarified that he has given up hope of resuming discussions with the Soviet Union on the German issue before the European Recovery Program is assured of success. He did not specify how long this period would be, but his statement that "there is no hope of a solution until it is shown in the coming months whether Western European civilization can overcome the destructive effects of the war and restore a healthy society" roughly indicates the time frame that Marshall anticipates.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] After Secretary Marshall's statement, the move by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to unify West Germany seems to be closer to reality. Diplomatic officials said that Marshall's words are a prelude to discussions between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France on merging the occupation zones in Germany, but Secretary Marshall does not believe that it is possible to hold three-country peace treaty talks with West Germany. However, diplomatic officials believe that the unification of the Western German occupation zones is the only superior strategy to pressure the Soviet Union to agree to resolve the German issue.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 19th] US Secretary of State Marshall has decided to follow Truman's advice and take a short break before participating in the legislative battle for the future $17 billion European Recovery Program. Marshall plans to spend his indefinite and short vacation at his winter villa near Pinehurst, North Carolina, on the 20th.</p>

<h3>Soviet Occupation Forces Attempt to Annex the Berlin Area</h3>

<h3>Britain and France Enthusiastically Welcome Truman's Long-Term European Aid Plan; US Republicans Demand Limitations on Amounts</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] London, 20th broadcast: A spokesman for the British Foreign Office expressed a warm welcome to President Truman's long-term European aid plan, considering it a major event in history. The President's emphasis on recovery rather than relief is particularly commendable. In addition, newspapers in various European countries have praised Truman's plan as much as possible, with the exception of the Communist Party. The latter believes that this is another step by US imperialism to control Europe.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 19th] After President Truman submitted the Marshall Plan to Congress, Republican opposition has become increasingly apparent. The Republican Policy Committee of the House of Representatives revealed that the majority of the committee members will insist that the annual aid amount not exceed four billion dollars. It is said that the Republicans have drafted a bill requiring limiting the amount of assistance and amending the plan proposed by the government. Although the vote of the Republican Policy Committee of the House of Representatives does not mean that Republican members of both houses will oppose Truman's plan, it shows a strong opinion from a part of Congress that supports limiting the annual aid amount to a maximum of four billion dollars and will firmly demand the implementation of this limitation. It is also learned that the Republican proposal will also include: Entrusting the task of funding public works and large-scale enterprises to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. First conduct a one-year trial of the European aid plan, and do not bind Congress to agree to the long-term aid for a period of four years and three months, as suggested by President Truman's message. Establish a bipartisan government agency that is accountable to both Congress and the President to manage the implementation of the European aid plan, instead of setting up only one general manager as suggested by Truman. It is heard that the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, Vandenberg and Eaton, are still reserved about the aforementioned amendments.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 20th] Senator Taft broadcast on the evening of the 19th that Truman's proposal for aid to Europe was slightly excessive.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 19th] French officials and the general public warmly welcomed President Truman's submission of the Marshall Plan to Congress.</p>

<h3>Argentina Proposes Suggestions at the International Trade Conference; Advocates US-Argentine Cooperation to Implement Economic Plans</h3>
<p>[United Press, Havana, 20th] Molina, the head of the Argentine delegation attending the International Trade Conference, proposed six plans on the 20th to establish an economic "one world" to solve current international problems. The United States and Argentina are the world's largest grain-producing countries, and close cooperation between the two countries will enable the entire plan to be implemented. Mr. Molina believes that the failure of the London Foreign Ministers Conference is tantamount to bringing the threat of war, so he urged immediate action to avoid world panic by means of economic and social measures.</p>
<p>Contains Six Points</p>
<p>The main points of Mr. Molina's plan are as follows: Immediately convene an international monetary conference to solve the world's shortage of gold and dollars. Formulate a plan to aid the Western Hemisphere, modeled after the Marshall Plan. The entire plan should be implemented by responsible agencies, including the United States and Argentina. Due to political problems and production restrictions, this plan must currently be limited to Western countries, but the Soviet Union can still participate. Western countries should work together to stipulate the export prices of the same products. Immediately take economic and social steps to create an economic "one world."</p>
<h3>Truman Wishes Overseas Soldiers a Happy Christmas; Hopes to Bring Peace and Freedom to Humanity</h3>

<h3>Prosecution of Nine Businessmen and Employees for Using China National Aviation Corporation Planes to Traffic Drugs, Yan Zaihou and Others Acquitted</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The case of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Kunming-Shanghai flights carrying large quantities of opium and morphine has been concluded by Chief Prosecutor Quan Tao of the District Procuratorate, who yesterday filed a public indictment on charges of attempted drug trafficking and corruption. The defendants are Nie Chengshan (from Yantai, Shandong, businessman, residing at No. 9, Yuan Garden Lane, Xin Zha Road, Shanghai, in custody), Yin Liangchen (from Kunming, Yunnan, medicine merchant, residing at No. 25, Xingye Lane, Linsen East Road, Shanghai, in custody), Gu Wenpeng (at large), Sha Pu (at large), Zhuang Zhongfu (from Chaozhou, Guangdong, tailor, residing at No. 3, Jishan Lane, Lane 61, Fuxi Road, Shanghai, in custody), Lü Huiming (from Chongqing, Sichuan, medicine merchant, residing at No. 3, Jishan Lane, Lane 61, Fuxi Road, Shanghai, in custody), Shi Ting (from Chongming, Jiangsu, mechanic, in custody), Sun Shougao (from Donghai, Jiangsu, mechanic, residing at No. 33, Jiaxing Road, Hongkou, in custody), and Wei Wenxiang (from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, mechanic, residing at No. 314, Zhongzheng Middle Road, Shanghai, in custody), a total of nine people.</p>
<p>Discovery Process</p>
<p>The indictment states: Gu, Sha, Zhuang, Lü, and others, through Gu Wenpeng, transported four packages of drugs from Kunming, Yunnan, and hid them in the CNAC plane they were travelling on. After arriving in Shanghai, Sun Shougao, a mechanic at the CNAC Shanghai airport, secretly took them out. Sun then asked his colleague Shi Ting to help, and Shi Ting sought the assistance of another colleague, Wei Wenxiang, to remove the drugs. Afterwards, Sun Shougao, Shi Ting, Wei Wenxiang, and others shared a reward of 20 million yuan. On November 3 of this year, Gu Wenpeng flew from Kunming to Shanghai again, bringing 31.160 kilograms of raw opium, divided into ten packages; 0.780 kilograms of processed opium, packed into one package; and 3.720 kilograms of morphine, divided into three packages. These were combined into two large bundles and hidden in the rear compartment of the cargo hold of Plane No. 47. After landing in Shanghai, Shi Ting was asked to take them out. Shi found the packages to be enormous and, as Wei Wenxiang was on leave, dared not take action. The next morning, the company discovered the drugs and turned them over to the customs. The case was then sent to the court on November 11.</p>
<p>Drug Trafficking Boss</p>
<p>According to Shi's testimony in court on December 1 of this year: "This time the opium was brought by Gu Wenpeng." "After being discovered by the company, I ran to Room 206, 2nd Floor, No. 587 Jing'an Temple Road, which was Sha's residence, and was monitored by people, who told me to call Nie Chengshan. Later, Nie came, along with Sha Pu, Gu Wenpeng, and myself. The four of us discussed it. I heard them using slang, referring to the goods as 'gold' and arranging to meet at the Great Bundle Hotel, Room 502, with Gu Wenpeng and Nie Chengshan." "This time, they didn't use slang, but directly called it opium." "On the 8th, the Great Eastern was closed, so they changed to Room 520 at the Great China Hotel, and Gu Wenpeng changed the registration name to Chen on the guest register. On the 9th and 10th, Sha, Gu, and others were discussing it, and Chengshan wanted Gu Wenpeng to pay compensation. Nie Chengshan is likely the big boss of the drug trafficking operation."</p>
<p>Commission of 20 Million</p>
<p>The defendant Yin Liangchen also firmly denied participating in the drug trafficking, but he admitted that he was from Kunming and lived in the home of Gu Wenpeng's mother-in-law in Kunming. He originally traded in Chinese medicinal materials, and when Gu Wenpeng first asked Shi to remove the drugs from the plane, he falsely claimed that they were valuable medicinal products, namely bezoar. Furthermore, according to Sun Shougao's testimony in this court on December 1 of this year, he received a commission of "20 million for removing the smuggled goods in May, of which 10 million was received from Yin Liangchen at No. 25, Xingye Lane, Xiafei Road. Gu Wenpeng gave me 9.5 million yuan, and I got another 500,000 from Nie Chengshan." This is concrete proof of the defendant's joint drug trafficking. As for his reversal of testimony in court on the 12th of this month, denying the fact that Sun Shougao had received 10 million yuan from him on the 1st of the same month, as well as his association with Gu Wenpeng, shows that his statement is false and unreliable. The defendant Zhuang Zhongfu gave Yin Liangchen 5 million yuan in legal tender to be given to Sun Shougao as a reward for transporting the drugs. He claimed to be in the business of selling Western clothing and knew Yin Liangchen through Western clothing transactions, and that he often borrowed money from Yin. When questioned about why he engaged in such an unrelated activity, he had no satisfactory explanation, making him also suspected in this case. Although the defendant Lü Huiming did not deny that he had taken 5 million yuan from Yin Liangchen because Yin Liangchen needed to pay Sun Shougao 10 million yuan in legal tender on the 5th of this year, he claimed that it was mid-September, which is clearly untrue and should be considered as having an accomplice relationship.</p>
<p>Three Employees Embezzle</p>
<p>Regarding Shi's involvement in Gu Wenpeng's loading and unloading of drugs, the defendant Shi frankly confessed to this court on December 1 of this year, "Sun Shougao had asked me to do it once before. At first, I thought it was smuggled goods brought on the plane, and I just took it when Sun asked me to. After getting such a large reward, I realized it was opium." "I asked Wei Wenxiang to take it for the first time, and I gave him 8 million yuan out of the 15 million yuan reward." When Sun Shougao was interrogated, he stated, "Gu gave me 20 million in foreign exchange, I kept 5 million, and the remaining 15 million was for Shi Ting and Wei Wenxiang to divide." When Wei Wenxiang was questioned, he stated, "I didn't know what it was, he asked me to help take it, and gave me 8 million yuan." According to the defendants Sun Shougao, Shi Ting, and Wei Wenxiang, all of whom are mechanics at the state-owned CNAC, regarding the unloading they did in May, all three testified that they heard Gu Wenpeng say it was smuggled rhinoceros horn, which indicates that they took advantage of their service at the airport to seek illegal profits, but did not have the intention of trafficking drugs. As for Shi Ting's actions the second time, having received an excessive reward the first time, he clearly knew that it was not ordinary smuggled goods. Moreover, according to the company employees Gao Junchen, Huang Yulin, Gu Zhenhan, and others, before the drugs were transported on November 3, there were already rumors of this at the airport. As the person involved, how could the defendant Shi Ting not know? However, he still listened to Gu Wenpeng's instructions and intended to unload the goods. At this time, it should be considered that he also had the act of attempted drug transportation.</p>

<h3>Two Western Newspapers Dissatisfied with Paper Allocation; Newspaper Association Issues Statement: There Has Never Been Any Bias Towards Chinese and Foreign Members</h3>
<p>Li Zikuan, chairman of the Shanghai Newspaper Commercial Association, issued the following statement on behalf of the association yesterday regarding the fact that the North China Daily News and the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, both members of the association, were dissatisfied with the fourth-period quota allocation and criticized the association:</p>
<p>Since the general meeting of all members of the association passed the fourth-quarter paper quota allocation plan for this year on the 18th of this month, the two member newspapers, the North China Daily News and the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, have made a lot of publicity and arbitrarily attacked the association in their respective newspapers due to the reduction in the quota. The articles published on the 19th and 20th, in addition to expressing their grievances, also contained rumors and speculations, which were further exaggerated. They not only made malicious comments and slandered the association, but also involved the Chinese government and other members of the association. The association does not want to criticize this kind of attitude. The association is confident that it handled this case completely in accordance with proper meeting procedures and has never been biased or private. The truth and falsehoods will be submitted to public opinion. The association's allocation quota is authorized by the Allocation Office of the Transportation and Management Committee, and the allocation draft is still reviewed and decided by the Allocation Office after it is passed, so the final authority rests with that office. If the allocation plan decided by this association is indeed inappropriate, there is still room for final remedy. However, the two Western newspapers publicly attacked this association and other parties before the remedy was exhausted. Their arrogance is truly astonishing. The reason why this association reduced the quotas of the two newspapers is entirely because they exceeded the number of pages allowed and failed to comply with the regulations, and there is no other reason. The government's regulation prohibiting additional pages should be consistently followed by all newspapers, both domestic and foreign. If this regulation only applies to Chinese-run newspapers and not to foreign-run newspapers, then not only will the government have no way to justify itself, but the restrictions will also be empty words. This association has never discriminated against Chinese and foreign members. As evidenced by the fact that the quotas of the two Western newspapers increased in the third period compared to the second period. If the two Western newspapers had not added pages in November, how could other members have the impression that they had too much paper? Members should know that today, no nationality should still have a special sense of superiority to clash with others. If this trend is started, foreign members of other industry associations may follow suit and use the methods of treating Chinese people ten years ago, failing to follow normal channels and using special solutions to resolve matters after the situation becomes serious. I am afraid that all public affairs will be impossible to handle, and the responsibility will be clear. I am truly afraid that various sectors will not understand the truth, so I am declaring the facts.</p>

<h3>Zhang Chunfan's Trial Concludes and Awaits Judgment; Testimony Emphasizes Discord Due to Leng Shan's Slander; Witnesses' Statements Show No Signs of Pessimism</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After Yue opera actress Xiao Dangui committed suicide, Zhang Chunfan was accused of instigating the suicide. The case is being heard in the Criminal Court of the District Court. It had already been held once before, and the debate court was held yesterday morning, the trial concluded, and sentencing is scheduled for the 27th of this month. At 9:25 a.m. yesterday, after Judge Mei Lehe and Prosecutor Chen Shoutao opened the eighth Criminal Court, Zhang Chunfan was ordered to appear in court. The District Court summoned witnesses Qian QiongYun, Xiao Dangui's younger sister, Wei Lanfang, an actress, Wu Chen, the director of the Guotai Yue Opera Theatre, and Shen Yitao, the manager of the Queen Yue Opera Theatre, to testify. Only Shen and Wei arrived yesterday. Zhang's testimony was the same as his written statement, emphasizing that the discord between him and Xiao was due to Leng Shan's slander. He also stated that Xiao committed suicide on October 13. Before the suicide, she intended to go to Hangzhou to negotiate the recovery of the Hangzhou house that had been occupied. After lunch, Xiao asked him if he was going to Hangzhou. He replied that he could not go. Shortly after, Wei Lanfang came to report that Xiao had committed suicide by taking poison. Next, witness Shen Yitao testified that on October 10, he was with Xiao and knew that a dispute had occurred between Zhang and Xiao, so he accompanied Xiao home and tried to persuade Zhang. On the afternoon of October 13, he went to Zhang's house again to chat and heard that Xiao wanted to go to Hangzhou. He left after a brief conversation. Before the incident, he saw no signs of resentment or pessimism from Xiao. Wei Lanfang testified: She had been performing on the same stage with Xiao Dangui for two or three years. On October 13, she went to Xiao's house, and Zhang Chunfan told her about Xiao's affair with Leng Shan. Later, Xiao also complained to her. On that day, Xiao was dressed up in gorgeous clothes and made up beautifully. Soon after, she saw Xiao's expression change greatly and ran into the room, picked up a pen, and wrote "Chunfan, you and I live together..." Seeing this, she grabbed the pen, and Xiao fell to the ground. At that time, the smell of lysol was very strong, knowing that she had taken poison, so she was rushed to the Sino-American Hospital, but she died. After the interrogation, Prosecutor Chen stood up and gave a legal argument, requesting that the defendant be sentenced according to law. Subsequently, the defendant's lawyer stood up to defend him and requested bail, which was not granted. In the end, the case was scheduled for sentencing, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Anhui Province After Robbery</h3>
<p>[Special report from our newspaper in Hefei on the 15th] From Hefei to Lu'an in western Anhui and then to Huoshan, all six small bridges on the highway were thoroughly destroyed by the bandit army but were jointly repaired by the National Army and the Anhui Highway Bureau. Due to military needs, traffic needs to be restored urgently. Some bridges are not strong enough, and cars passing over them inevitably cause concern. There is still no passenger bus from Lu'an to Huoshan, and there are scattered bandits along the way. Our group of eight colleagues, led by Li Xuetan, a secretary of the rank of colonel from the Eighth Pacification District Headquarters, accompanied by two military vehicles, departed from Hefei to Huoshan. On the way to Huoshan, a certain division of the National Army sent additional troops to protect us. In the car, we only saw military vehicles coming and going, and there were no commercial vehicles at all. Even human-powered wheelbarrows and pedestrians were not as frequent and continuous as between Lu'an and Hefei. Today, advancing from the edge of Dabie Mountain to Shanqiu is getting more and more desolate. This is the result of Liu Bocheng's entry into Dabie Mountain from southwestern Shandong.</p>
<p>Autumn Harvest Depleted, Spring Famine Worrying</p>
<p>The car raced on the highway, bumpy. The reporter happened to be traveling after being ill, and felt particularly tired. Anyone who has traveled on the Anhui Highway (especially the western Anhui Highway) will feel the difficulty of traveling. Because the tea, hemp, bamboo, wood, charcoal produced in western Anhui are transported only by this highway. In addition to carrying on shoulders, the transportation tool is a hand-pushed wheelbarrow. The road surface is earthen. Thousands and tens of thousands of wheelbarrows pass by all year round, and at a glance, there are small ditches. Even if it is a stone road surface, it is said that it cannot withstand years of wheelbarrow rolling, which makes the road surface rugged, like the Shu Road. This kind of heavy-duty wheelbarrow is the largest in human-powered transportation capacity. It cannot be prohibited and should not be prohibited. Therefore, the road surface can only get worse day by day, and driving is like dancing. On rainy days, it is suspended. The second problem is that the rice fields on both sides of the highway are still gray and withered rice straw roots. Very few have been plowed and turned over. This is to tell us that after the robbery in western Anhui, human and animal power are generally lacking. This year's autumn is dry, and the planted wheat has not sprouted due to uneven rainfall. Most of this year's autumn harvest was consumed by bandits, hiding a terrible spring famine next year. For thousands of years, our farmers have relied on the heavens for food, and can only wait with their eyes open for a moderate winter rain. If the people who handle relief in the bandit area cannot achieve practical benefits for the people, our farmers will have no other hope. Speaking of the third problem, that is, the one that has the greatest relationship with the rural economy of western Anhui, the tea production in Lu'an and Huoshan. According to the statistics of the Anhui Construction Department, the tea production area in Lu'an is 114,580 mu, with an average annual output of 35 catties per mu. The tea production area in Huoshan is 88,017 mu, with an average annual output of 30 catties per mu. The current price of tea is between 70,000 and 120,000 yuan per catty. Adding up the statistics of the two counties, this income is too amazing. On the way to Luohuo, the short tea bushes on both sides sway in the long weeds. In the spring of this year, the Anhui Relief Sub-Administration had an organization of a working team for the revitalization of tea gardens in western Anhui, using flour to encourage tea farmers to cultivate and weed. Looking at it today, that work was in vain, no wonder the tea production in western Anhui is declining.</p>
<p>The Gateway to Western Anhui Is Difficult to Open</p>
<p>General Tan Heyi, the division commander of a certain division of the National Army, is now stationed in Lu'an. He tracked and pursued Liu Bocheng from the south bank of the Yellow River, dragging its tail. After passing the Shahe River, the Shihe River, and crossing the Weihe River, he marched thousands of miles to Lu'an. At that time, the Third Column, the elite force of the bandits, was actually occupying Lu'an. Commander Tan's division captured it with three divisions. It is said that this was something that Liu Bocheng did not expect.</p>
<p>Commander Tan talked about his experience in fighting bandits. The bandit army's combat is that the first line is a small number of so-called old Eighth Route Army soldiers leading a large number of militiamen, followed by "supervisory teams." This "supervisory team" is composed of Communist Party members, armed with machine guns aimed at the militiamen. If the militiamen retreat during combat, they will be shot dead immediately, forcing the militiamen to dare not retreat. Originally thought that the bandit army was brave, but soon broke through its method, in addition to attacking the first line head-on, also attacked the "supervisory team" by detouring. After defeating the "supervisory team," the first line immediately collapsed, so many were captured along the way. The bandit army really cannot withstand the attack, and its mobility is greater, which is one of the reasons. Now Commander Tan is stationed in Lu'an, which is considered the most stable life in three months, and his troops have entered the eastern foot of Dabie Mountain to carry out sweeping operations.

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Registers Grain Merchants - Formulates Eight Guidelines for Grain Merchants</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has decided to re-register grain merchants and has formulated guidelines for grain merchants so that each grain merchant understands the procedures for various groups. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>1 Grain shops that have already been established should, according to custom, first join the same trade association, obtain membership qualifications, and then obtain a grain merchant registration application form from each association, fill it out in detail, and send it to the Fourth Section of the Social Affairs Bureau for review along with the capital and purchase and sales ledgers. It will be reviewed immediately upon arrival, and the approval or rejection will be returned immediately. However, it must meet one of the following requirements:</p>
<p>Those engaged in retail and wholesale should have capital equivalent to or greater than the price of twenty market stones of grain in the local area.</p>
<p>Those engaged in procurement and sales should have capital equivalent to or greater than the price of forty market stones of grain in the local area.</p>
<p>Grain warehouses should have a reasonable warehouse with a capacity of storing more than two hundred market stones.</p>
<p>Processing businesses should have equipment with all processing tools.</p>
<p>Brokerage businesses should have a fixed address and brand name, as well as proof of assets equivalent to or greater than the price of twenty market stones of grain in the local area. Newly established grain shops should first apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for a grain merchant registration application form, fill it out in detail, and send it to the Social Affairs Bureau to send personnel to investigate and pass the qualification, issue a license, and then join the same trade association, be listed as a member, and start business.</p>
<p>2 When grain merchants organized as companies apply for grain merchant registration, they should submit the company registration license of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the company's articles of association, a business plan, and a list of directors, supervisors, and staff. It should be submitted by the Social Affairs Bureau to the Ministry of Food for approval and issuance of a license. The registration of branches should wait until the company is registered before applying to the local food authority where the branch is located.</p>
<p>3 Branches or factories of grain merchants should also apply for grain merchant registration separately and obtain a license before they can operate.</p>
<p>4 When registered grain merchants close down, go out of business, or dissolve, they should report to the Social Affairs Bureau in writing within ten days and surrender their business license.</p>
<p>5 If a registered grain merchant transfers all of its business to another person, the transferor and the transferee should jointly apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for registration in writing within ten days and exchange the business license.</p>
<p>6 If there are any doubts about the ledgers submitted during registration, a license will be issued after sending personnel to verify them on the spot.</p>
<p>7 In addition to applying for grain merchant registration, grain businesses should apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for commercial registration after obtaining a business license. Those with a larger scope of processing business should also apply for factory registration.</p>
<p>8 When grain merchants with the same brand name apply for registration, they should make corrections and reapply in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Registration Law.</p>

<h3>Detailed Rules for Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Still Awaiting Instructions from the Executive Yuan and Ministry Before Decision</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Since Chairman Yuan of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee took office, the full implementation of cotton yarn and cloth control has involved a wide range of issues. After several gatherings of experts from various departments for careful research and discussion, a management implementation plan was drafted and personally brought to the Executive Yuan and Ministry in Beijing the night before last for decision. It is understood that the general contents are centralized procurement of domestic cotton, commissioned spinning of cotton yarn, commissioned weaving and dyeing and finishing of yarn and cloth distribution, and export of yarn and cloth. It is heard that although the new plan has been decided in principle, various details such as whether to purchase all existing cotton or retain part of it, how to deal with existing yarn and cloth, and how to deal with duplicate products are still awaiting Chairman Yuan's instructions from the Executive Yuan and Ministry before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Express Opinions on Textile and Adjustment Committee's Purchase of Domestic Cotton</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Liu Pingsun, Chairman of the Shanghai Cotton Business Association, spoke to reporters yesterday about the purchase of domestic cotton: The National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee is about to be established. He had inquired with Yuan , Chairman of the Textile and Adjustment Committee, about the purchase of domestic cotton. According to Mr. Yuan, the authorities intend to entrust local established enterprises to collect the cotton on their behalf. However, this approach does not seem to take into account the livelihoods of small cotton enterprises. It is best for local cotton enterprises to organize a unified agency, jointly purchase the cotton, and then allocate the cotton obtained to the Textile and Adjustment Committee. In this way, regardless of the size of the cotton enterprise, it will have the right to purchase cotton. The survival of small cotton enterprises can be maintained, and the government will not need to set up separate agencies in cotton-producing areas.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Specious</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>One day, friends gathered together and suddenly discussed the recently popular short shirts and long trousers worn by women, feeling that this kind of attire was somewhat mismatched. One friend said: This is entirely created by American young soldiers. They wanted Chinese women to have some foreign charm, but also to not deviate from the "Chinese essence," thus creating this look.</p>
<p>We naturally dare not completely assert that the motivation for this kind of attire is so, but by extrapolating from this, since the Western scientific ideas that have been introduced into China in the last hundred years are innumerable, every one of them has been distorted, becoming "specious."</p>
<p>I live in an area near the southern district of Shanghai, which is a genuine "Chinese district." Taking a walk down the street, one can see "atomic photos," "atomic leather shoes," atomic this, atomic that. You will suddenly be utterly confused. The United States, which invented the atomic bomb, still cannot apply atomic energy to power as of now, yet China can actually take photos and make leather shoes. Isn't that strange!</p>
<p>The process of all sciences entering China is roughly like this: • speaking and discussing randomly; • imitating randomly; • turning the direction and specializing in evil. The former example does not need to be discussed. Atomic photography is one example; there are many more examples of the latter. You can go to the street and see that we can make almost all of the latest foreign industrial products, except for heavy industries. There are dozens of brands of 51-type fountain pens. The best-selling new foreign books are immediately pirated, even magazines are no exception. Toothpaste imitates Kolynos, soap imitates Palmolive, and cigarettes imitate Lucky Strike even more vividly. Like this, all consumables that are easy to learn and make big money from are things that people rack their brains to do. As for turning the direction, an electric machine can produce vitamins ABCD, and can also mass-produce heroin and morphine. A printing press can print books and periodicals, why can't it print counterfeit money? What we know is already countless, and what we don't know, we don't know how much more there is!</p>
<p>China was originally the best at absorbing foreign civilization and also the best at assimilating foreigners. In modern times, there are hardly any traces of genuine Chinese style left in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Clothing is barbarian clothing (ancient China had no trousers, people sat on the ground. Wearing trousers and having tables and chairs were introduced from Western Regions countries, so the earliest chair was called a barbarian bed). Flatbread and fried dough sticks are the barbarian food of *bi luo*, which is barbarian cake, and there were many vendors selling it in Chang'an in the Tang Dynasty. Housing and vehicles have recently become mostly Westernized. However, no matter what, there should be a principle, which is to "choose the good and follow it," and do it thoroughly. You can't learn it randomly, never digest it, and then abandon it after a while, like a child buying snacks in an alley. This is bound to affect overall health. The foreign culture that ancient people came into contact with may have been simpler than modern culture, so its reaction was more rational and correct. In the last fifty years, the speed of change in the material environment has been too fast, so China has become a fool who is flustered, neither east nor west, making everything unlike anything, but wanting to learn everything. The result is that there is everything and there is nothing, creating a fully "specious" situation.</p>
<p>If material things are like this, what about thoughts? Although Zhang Wenxiang was not very good, he still dared to say the sentence "Chinese learning for the body, Western learning for the use." Now we have gradually lost our center and are at a loss, and everything has become "specious" everywhere!</p>
<h3>Mirror</h3>
<p>— Zhuge Lang</p>
<p>An old grandmother told her granddaughter:</p>
<p>"Don't trust the mirror. Look at me! I've looked in the mirror for decades, and finally, I've reflected this current appearance!"</p>
<h3>On "Arguing"</h3>
<p>— Dong Jinhu</p>
<p>When things get to the point of having to argue, it's probably more ominous than auspicious. The ancients were afraid of going to court because they were afraid that once they argued and couldn't clear themselves, their heads would be in danger of moving; today, people are actually also very afraid of government offices, although some people like to litigate, they are ultimately in the minority, and to some extent, they always have a bit of acting tough, or using the name of someone who often goes to government offices, waving a big flag as a tiger skin to scare others, all of which belong to a special class, not what I want to discuss. What I'm talking about here belongs to good people, who usually hang the Zhu Bo family instructions, and these people's life attitude is generally to argue less and yield more, and not go to government offices.</p>
<p>Arguing less naturally means talking less as well. It is said that people before the Qin Dynasty liked to talk more than those after, so in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, there were many debaters. Later, probably due to the principle of "a tree that stands out in the forest will be blown down by the wind, and behavior that is higher than the majority will be criticized by the crowd," there were fewer debaters, but they were still not abolished. Later, debating became even more inferior, shaking the tongue, and was not adopted by gentlemen, and was called: vulgar.</p>
<p>The source of this vulgarity is said to have arisen from uselessness. Once something is useless, even the best thing will be reduced to lowliness. There are many examples of "uselessness," the more famous one being Yang Yun's reply to Sun Huizong's letter, which is actually a good piece of argumentative writing, but it couldn't save this author. From this, it can be seen that debating is useless, and in government offices, debating is even more useless.</p>
<p>I prefer to talk more. Although I will also be silent, the latter is mostly out of necessity and not a wish, because I love to talk, so I inevitably argue more. Although my fate is still good, I have not entered government offices or been subjected to official punishment, but in ordinary days, the word "vulgar" is unavoidable.</p>
<p>People who have read a few books of poetry and sayings of Confucius always hope that they can be a bit more elegant, but people's nature is sometimes very difficult to wear down. An elegant facade is certainly important, but when it comes to government offices, and life and death are at stake, life is ultimately more valuable than the facade, so it is better to be a bit vulgar and save one's life than to be elegant and lose one's life. This is precisely "necessity," but it is also genuine sentiment.</p>
<h3>Blank Paper Document</h3>
<p>— Yue Ping</p>
<p>Since the start of the Second World War, the most important international document has of course been the United Nations Declaration signed in 1943. This declaration adopted the principles of the Atlantic Charter, and most of the world's countries united through this declaration, fighting shoulder to shoulder, and to this day, everyone is still relying on this declaration's bit of connection, striving for lasting peace at Lake Success and Flushing Meadows—at least replacing armed conflict with heated debate.</p>
<p>However, how was this declaration actually signed! It was not until recently that everyone learned about it.</p>
<p>On that day, representatives from various countries gathered at the White House, waiting specifically to sign the agreement. President Roosevelt was naturally elated, extending warm hospitality. The conversation was lively and engaging, and everyone cheerfully emptied their cocktail glasses. The time for signing the agreement arrived.</p>
<p>However, where was that most important United Nations Declaration! Some people said that they had seen this document in the White House, but after searching everywhere, there was no trace of it. The host could not help but be anxious, so the tall-stemmed wine glasses in front of the distinguished guests were refilled, while some of the guests were whispering among themselves.</p>
<p>Then someone remembered that the document might be in the State Department. The State Department is in charge of foreign affairs, so they would naturally know the whereabouts of this document. The White House officials immediately called the State Department, but that day was a weekend, and the State Department had no one working except for a few junior staff members on duty. After inquiring carefully for a long time, one staff member remembered that the document was indeed locked in the State Department's safe.</p>
<p>Who could open the safe!</p>
<p>White House personnel desperately searched and finally found someone who knew how to open this safe. He lived in a village far from Washington, D.C., where transportation was quite inconvenient. However, the voice on the phone from the White House was already frantically anxious, repeatedly urging him to immediately return to the State Department to open the safe.</p>
<p>That staff member said: He did know how to open the safe, and he was also very willing to rush back to Washington immediately. However, all of this was useless. Because the safe had a time lock, and no one could open it until Monday morning.</p>
<p>The White House staff had to report this matter to the President tremblingly. Roosevelt couldn't help but laugh, and he told those diplomats on the spot about this difficulty. Then, he took a blank sheet of paper from the drawer, and asked them to sign on this blank sheet of paper—while asking each representative to trust him (Roosevelt), promising that what they were now signing was indeed the United Nations Declaration.</p>
<p>The diplomats also laughed, and they signed one after another. Later, this blank sheet of paper was pasted on the original agreement. They resolutely signed the largest blank check in history—and how valuable this check is will depend on how historians write about it in later generations.</p>
<h3>Several Novelists in Beiping</h3>
<p>— Lü Xian</p>
<p>"Free Talk" using Chen Shenyan's novels, "New Garden" using Zhang Henshui, and "Great Park" using Old Woman, felt that the literary atmosphere in Shanghai had greatly changed; therefore, the author would like to briefly introduce several first-class famous writers in the North below:</p>
<p>Chen Shenyan, former editor of the Beijing News in Beiping, is calm and taciturn, just like his name. Since the Beijing News stopped publication, he has had very little contact with the outside world, and writing novels is his daily work. His works are mostly of the genre of expressing love in society, depicting tenderness and lingering feelings, which make people shed tears when reading them. Published novels include "Such a Clear Sky," "Doomed Jinghua," "Unspeakable," and "A Soul Lost in the Sea of Love," about dozens of kinds.</p>
<p>Zhang Henshui, former editor of the Beijing World Daily in Beiping, has a thin body, a slightly pockmarked face, a mouthful of gold teeth, a southern accent, and likes to sing Peking opera. The author once listened to him perform Chong Gongdao in "Escorting a Female Prisoner" and Zhang Sanlang in "Wulongyuan." His works include "The Unofficial History of Chunming," "Half-New Daughters," and "A Laughing Marriage," about dozens of kinds, all of which are works of romance, emphasizing the description of the characters' personalities.</p>
<p>Zhao Huanting is a master of martial arts set in the countryside, and he writes about the forms of women with bound feet in great detail. Before the war, he swept across the entire North China, and his works are too numerous to remember, but unfortunately, the author is not good at reading martial arts novels, and all the titles of this gentleman's novels cannot be remembered for a while.</p>
<p>Old Woman (Xu Yu Kai), former editor of the Beiping Zui Bao, is a middle school teacher, and is famous for editing the student edition, and is not originally a novelist. The two works he disclosed in Shanghai this time--"County Magistrate" and "Anti-Japanese Beauty"--are still his debut works, so the style is not like a chapter novel, and he writes in the tone of Beiping "storytelling," which has surprisingly become a unique style.</p>
<p>Huanzhulouzhu (Li Shoumin) is a peculiar novelist. The book "Legend of the Swordsman of Mount Shu" is so long that it cannot be measured in miles, because he involves the magical and can grasp the majority of readers. Sometimes his novel moves from newspaper A to newspaper B, allowing those who change their subscription to newspaper B in order to read his novels. The strength of its appeal is like this.</p>
<h3>First Time Being a Dad</h3>
<p>— Qian Fanfu</p>
<p>On the day of the first snowfall this year, I became the father of a girl.</p>
<p>Although I had hoped for a boy beforehand, this didn't have much of an impact. I immediately felt a new human love's power stirring my soul. Although it wasn't as passionate as the love between husband and wife, it was more natural.</p>
<p>I was so moved that I smiled, but then tears fell. I created a small life, silently contemplating the wonders of creation. Her face really looked seven parts like me and three parts like my wife. After laughing, I couldn't help but shed tears like a spring. I thought about the responsibility that was weighed down on the shoulders of every new father, especially in this difficult era. I felt a combination of joy and fear.</p>
<p>My tears dried, and my thoughts condensed into a firm will—this was not a fantasy at the peak of emotion, but a vow to be upheld forever: I will always protect the love and obligations I am entitled to, and not only be an honest husband, but also be a good "dad."</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>Chapter 5: Unexpected Disaster (20)</p>
<p>As soon as Xu Zhuzhai entered the room, he sat on the sofa, held his left leg, and frowned tightly, as if he couldn't bear the pain. Little Wang's mother poured a glass of water and asked him to drink it. Seeing that his knees and cuffs were covered with dirt, she used a towel to wipe it clean for him. Zhuzhai still held his left leg, complaining of pain. Little Wang's mother said, "Mr. Xu, take a look at your leg and see if the skin is injured, so I can find something to apply to it." Zhuzhai indeed pulled up his trousers, revealing his pale white calf, and then pointed to his leg bone, saying, "I feel uncomfortable with pain right here." Little Wang's mother took two steps closer, squatted down to take a look, and there wasn't even a hint of redness on the skin, so she said, "The skin isn't broken, I'm afraid the tendons and bones are injured, let me rub it for you." As she spoke, she stretched out her palm and gently rubbed where Zhuzhai pointed, while softly laughing, "People still say you practice martial arts, with such a small leg, so white and tender, what strength does it have!" As she spoke, she raised her head and glanced at Zhuzhai. Seeing her expression was very dissolute, Zhuzhai closed his eyes. He asked Xiao, "Who said I practice martial arts?" Little Wang's mother pursed her small mouth and said, "Your wife said it. That night, she said from under the stage that you get up at dawn every day, either yelling or practicing Baguazhang, and only come home in the evening, completely ignoring the family." Then, she lightly patted Zhuzhai's calf and said, "Such thin legs, and you still say you practice martial arts!" Zhuzhai suddenly opened his eyes and said, "You don't believe me?" Then, he exerted strength in his leg, and the calf immediately tightened and the tendons stretched. Little Wang's mother pinched it and it was like an iron pillar. She asked in surprise, "Mr. Xu, don't you feel the pain when you exert yourself like this?" As soon as Zhuzhai heard this, he quickly frowned. The muscles in the calf relaxed again. Little Wang's mother's hand was still rubbing on his calf, saying, "Rub it for a while longer, get up and walk around, move the muscles and bones, and it will be fine." Zhuzhai still kept his eyes closed, letting her massage him, while asking, "Did the boss go to the countryside?" Little Wang's mother pursed her small mouth and said, "She went to Director Lin's house. The boss just came back today, and hadn't even entered the house before she was picked up." Zhuzhai said, "What is this Director Lin's name?" Little Wang's mother put her hand under her chin and thought for a moment, saying, "It seems to be something like Futian. The boss always calls him that. It's said that he's from Fujian, and some say he's from Taiwan, I'm not sure. That face is very ugly, with a flat nose, sunken eyes, and flaring ears, three parts like a human, seven parts like a ghost!" Hearing this, Zhuzhai couldn't help but laugh. He said, "The boss is so beautiful, why would she be friends with such an ugly ghost?" Little Wang's mother raised her head and looked at Zhuzhai, saying, "Speaking of which, the boss is also very wronged. The boss has recently arranged several historical dramas and needs to add stage costumes. In order for this Director Lin to help her, she has to appease him." Hearing Little Wang's mother say these words, the suspicion in Zhuzhai's heart completely dissipated. He couldn't help but sigh silently, feeling that Jiang Wan was too pitiful.</p>
<h3>Mr. Li Denghui's Deeds</h3>
<p>Mr. Li's given name was Denghui, courtesy name Tengfei, a native of Tongan, Fujian. His ancestors were surnamed Huang, but he followed his maternal family and became a Li. His father was Mr. Kaiyuan, and his mother was Madam Shen Bi'niang. He was born on March 24th of the twelfth year of Tongzhi (April 20, 1873, Gregorian calendar) in Hongba Village (Parmera) outside Batavia, Dutch-owned Java. At the age of fifteen (1887), he went to Singapore to study. At nineteen, he went to the United States and entered Wesleyan University, then transferred to Yale University. At twenty-seven (1899), he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree. The following year, he went to Binlangyu and served as the director of the English department at Yinghua College. He attended meetings organized by Mr. Sun Yat-sen to promote revolution. At thirty (1902), he returned to Batavia and became the principal of Yale School. In the thirty-first year of Guangxu (1905), at the age of thirty-three, he returned to China and went to Shanghai, where he co-founded the Real World Chinese Students' Association with Mr. Yan Junren, Mr. Wang Rutang, and Mr. Cao Xue. Mr. Li served as the president for several decades. In the autumn of the same year, Mr. Ma Xiangbo founded Fudan Public School in Wusong, and invited Mr. Li to be the chief instructor. Mr. Li delighted in nurturing talent and dedicated his life to it, starting from then. Later, Mr. Yan Youlu, Mr. Xia Jian, and Mr. Gao Mengdan successively served as supervisors, and Mr. Li served as the dean of academic affairs, responsible for hiring teachers and planning the curriculum. In the thirty-third year (1907), he married Ms. Tang Peilin. In the same year, he served as the examiner for students from Jiangnan studying abroad. In the first year of Xuantong (1909), he also served as the chief examiner for students from Zhejiang Province studying in the United States. In the third year (1911), he served as the chief writer for the Republican Advocate and concurrently taught at China Public School. When the revolutionary army rose, Governor Li Songqing of the Wuhan Military Government invited Mr. Li to preside over foreign affairs, but he did not go. During the North-South peace talks, he served as a consultant for Dr. Wu Zhiyong, the Southern representative. In the first year of the Republic of China (1912), Fudan Public School moved to Xujiahui. The following year, Mr. Xiangbo retired due to old age. At that time, the Kuomintang had just been established, and Chairman Sun Yat-sen and others recommended Mr. Li as the principal. In the sixth year, Fudan Public School was reorganized into a university, with departments of liberal arts, science, and commerce. In the winter of the same year, he went to various parts of Southeast Asia to raise funds. He returned to China in the seventh year and received an honorary doctorate from St. John's University in the eighth year. Mr. Li first purchased land in Jiangwan as the site for Fudan University. By the ninth year, he had accumulated more than seventy acres of land, and construction began in the tenth year. After much hardship, the project was finally completed. In the eleventh year, the lecture hall (Jian Gong Hall), the office (now the library), and a dormitory (destroyed by the Japanese寇, now Denghui Hall is built on the old site) were completed first. The university department moved to Jiangwan, while the Xujiahui campus was used for the middle school department. In April of the thirteenth year, Mr. Li went to various parts of Southeast Asia again to raise funds. After more than a year, he returned to China and established the Fudan Experimental Middle School. In the eighteenth year, in accordance with the Ministry of Education's regulations for universities, the university department was reorganized into four colleges: liberal arts, science, law, and commerce. Mr. Li had wanted to establish agricultural and architectural engineering departments, but both were unsuccessful (civil engineering courses have been taught since the twelfth year, and the university now has a college of agriculture). In January of the twentieth year, Madam Tang passed away. Mr. Li was deeply devoted to his marital relationship. He had three sons and one daughter, all of whom died young. His son Youren died at the age of nine. Bereaved of his spouse, he was depressed and almost beside himself. He also built a residence on Tengpei Road in Jiangwan, where he could enjoy his books, flowers, and trees in a small space. After Madam Tang passed away, he never lived there again. In the twenty-first year, the Japanese invaded Shanghai and destroyed it. In the twenty-third year, Mr. Li built the Fu Yu Institute on land he owned near the West Gymnasium Road in Jiangwan to collect street children who had dropped out of school, provide them with education and training, and enable them to become self-reliant through a skill. It had achieved initial results, but was destroyed by the Japanese in the August 13th Incident. In August of the twenty-fifth year, Mr. Li requested leave, and the board of directors appointed Mr. Qian Xinzhi as acting principal and Mr. Wu Nanxuan as vice principal. Mr. Li was then appointed as a legislator, but he declined. He then went down the Yangtze River and entered Shu, returning after three months. He was warmly welcomed by his students and acquaintances wherever he went, and the people of Sichuan were particularly impressed. Later, Fudan University was relocated to Sichuan, and local gentry were happy to assist. Mr. Li's trip paved the way for this. In the spring of the twenty-sixth year, Mr. Wu Zhihui transferred more than a thousand acres of mountainous land on the shore of Taihu Lake in Wuxi to Fudan University. Mr. Li, along with several directors, personally went to receive it and, together with Mr. Zhihui and Mr. Rong Desheng, inspected the site and indicated the location for construction. In the summer of the same year, he sent teachers and students from the civil engineering department to Wuxi to survey and plan. However, before the plan could be finalized, the Japanese invaded, and the school moved inland. Some teachers and students were unable to go due to the environment. Uncertain of what to do, Mr. Li established the Shanghai Fudan University Preparatory Department in the old foreign concession the following year. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the old foreign concession was also occupied by the Japanese. The enemy puppets wanted to gather popularity in order to rally support, so they secretly tried to coerce Mr. Li and Mr. Zhang Yongni. Mr. Yongni had heard something beforehand and claimed to be ill and did not go out, and sent someone to inform Mr. Li. Mr. Li then changed his name and hurriedly entered the Weida Hotel from his residence on Yuyuan Road, and did not let anyone know except his closest friends. After a while, he moved into Beverly House on Baise Zhong Road for almost a year. As the enemy puppets' surveillance gradually relaxed, he moved to Ruicun on Haige Road, and the Fudan University Preparatory Department, after moving three times to avoid danger, finally rented a house on Hede Road to start classes. During the eight years, Mr. Li personally handled all matters of the school, large and small, as in the past. The registration of new students and the grades of graduating students were reported to the Ministry and secretly sent to the wartime capital on time. At a time when the public was fearful, in a place under internal and external pressure, and at a time when livelihoods were precarious, he led the teachers and students to overcome all difficulties and ultimately preserved its integrity. In the thirty-fourth year (1945), the Anti-Japanese War was won, Fudan University had been changed to a national university, and Mr. Zhang Yousan had replaced Mr. Wu Nanxuan as the principal, returning from the wartime capital. Mr. Li gave detailed instructions on everything. Because the Jiangwan campus was occupied by the pseudo-Shanghai University during its fall, it was largely destroyed, and the Sichuan campus was expanded after several wars, plus the preparatory department, the number of teachers and students in both places, and the past teaching environment, there was no room for lectures, accommodation, and meals. For several months, he organized the old campus and planned new campuses. With the encouragement of Mr. Li, faculty and staff inside and outside the school overcame difficulties and did their best. After the completion, Mr. Li thanked the university for its school affairs and gave guidance at any time, responding to every question, and attending every major gathering to give instructions. The affiliated middle school and the affiliated experimental middle school were reorganized into a board of directors, and remained the private Fudan Middle School and the private Fudan Experimental Middle School, with Mr. Li serving as the chairman of the boards of directors of both schools, and concurrently serving as the principal of both schools, going to school every day to handle government affairs, with no cold or neglect. Mr. Li's spirit was as strong as before, but his eyesight was deteriorating, but he still went to the classroom every day to inspect. On the night of July 30, 1947, he suddenly suffered a stroke and was bedridden. His students were concerned about his illness and often talked to him about school matters. On November 19, at 4 pm, he passed away due to pneumonia, at the age of 75. He left a will that his brother Mr. Dengshan's third son, Xianzheng, be his heir. On the 22nd, he was buried in the Presbyterian Cemetery in Baziqiao, in the tomb prepared by Madam Tang. Mr. Li was very strict with himself and particularly frugal. He donated one-tenth of all his income from writing and royalties to public welfare and charitable causes, so he left nothing of value behind him. Mr. Li dedicated his life to education and had no intention of becoming an official. He gave full support to the development of culture, academic research, patriotic movements, and social welfare. He also gladly accepted and did his best in all public welfare and voluntary positions. He successively served as a member of the American Geographical Society, a member of the American Political Science Association, the vice chairman of the National Government's Opium Prohibition Committee, a member of the National Government's Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, the honorary chairman of the Overseas Chinese Federation, the chairman of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, a member of the China Road Association, the president of the National Christian Youth Association, the president of the Shanghai Christian Youth Association, a member of the Chinese Christian Education Association, the president of the Chinese Child Welfare Association, and the chairman of the National Diplomacy Support Association. Mr. Li often wrote articles to express his views, which were published in newspapers and magazines. Mr. Li was intelligent and eager to learn, and always had a book in his hand. He learned Dutch, English, and Malay as a child. Due to local government regulations, he could not learn Chinese at an early age. After returning to China, he began to learn Chinese from others. In a few years, he was able to read and write fluently. While in the United States, he learned Greek, Latin, French, and German. In the early days of Fudan, students who studied ancient and modern foreign languages were taught by Mr. Li himself. He devoted particular effort to English. He served as the chief English editor of the China Book Company and also compiled textbooks such as "Practical English Textbook," "Cultural English Reader," "Li's English Composition," "Li's English Rhetoric," and "Important Factors in the China Problem," which were widely circulated at the time. The cooperative cause in China was pioneered by Mr. Xue Xianzhou of Fudan. After Mr. Xue passed away, Mr. Li worked hard to maintain it. Mr. Li was very devout in Christianity but rarely forced it on others, and particularly liked to talk about De Talk Kelsi. Fudan has had an administrative meeting since the 13th year. Mr. Li handled school affairs and made decisions based on public opinion, and his actions matched his words. He taught students by encouraging and rewarding them, making sure they believed before following. What he always said was that one must be willing to sacrifice to be successful, one must be happy to serve to be useful, and one must be able to unite to be powerful, with impartiality as the guiding principle. He was saddened by the rampant flow of human desires and lamented the suppression of justice, so he particularly emphasized moral revitalization. Mr. Li is gone, but his virtue is in people's hearts, his achievements are in people's eyes, and his words are in people's ears. It is said that there are three types of immortality, and Mr. Li possessed all of them. This is his deed.</p>
