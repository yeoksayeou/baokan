<h3>三中全會宣言</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿四日電〕中國國民黨第六屆中央執行委員會第三次全體會議宣言，於廿四日下午第十次大會中經全體一致通過，全文如次：</p>
<p>本黨此次全體會議，為勝利還都後第一次集會，距上次全會，為時適滿一年，此一年間，中國政治上最大之成就，厥為國民大會之召集，與中華民國憲法之頒行。</p>
<p>國父倡導革命，建立民国之目的，與本黨北伐成功以來，一貫努力之主張，經過千回百折，而終於實現。本會議舉行於頒憲已屆三月之時，一方面欣幸於憲政實施之有期，建國素願之克遂，同時省察吾國當前之現狀，戰後之瘡痍未蘇，復興之進行多阻，和平統一備受破壞，勝利成果，無由發揚，民生困苦，社會杌陧，經濟動盡，人心散漫，則又深慨國運之多艱，益感革命責任之重大，窮以國父所昭示吾人奮鬥之準則為救國，救人，救世之大仁，為明是非，別利害，識時勢，知彼己之大智，為有主義，有目的，有智識之大勇，故天下為公，為本黨之襟懷，為民服務，為本黨之天職，與時俱進，為本黨之特性，而義之所在，貫澈始終，更為本黨所由突破艱危，善盡責任之根本。吾人在抗戰劇烈之時期，已早作歸政全民之準備，過去此一年間，為使愛國有志之人士，同負促成憲政之職責，更復迭次表示願與舉國賢達，相互提脅，宏濟艱難，今者擴大政府基礎之成議已在實施，國民政府改組完成之日，即為訓政開始結束之時，由茲以至政治，本黨所處之地位，及其對於政府之關係，自不同於往時，然而本黨救國救民之精誠，實行主義，保衛民國之責任，則義應積極繼承，而決不有絲毫之諉卸。本會議此次集會，對於如何刷新本黨，充實本黨，俾能適應新時代之責任，已作詳盡之計議，茲願就檢討國內外形勢之結果，因應當前國家民族重大迫切之需要，列舉今後所應努力之要務，據其忠悃，簡要陳述於國人之前。</p>
<p>完成憲政準備　確立建國規模</p>
<p>其一，完成憲政準備，確立建國規模，本黨五十年來，一貫奮鬥之目的，即在掃除民治之障碍，造成實行三民主義之中華民國。自國民政府定都南京，迄今廿年，建國工作，雖疊遭重大之障碍，而經過八年之神聖抗戰，國父之三民主義，卒為全國共同接受，奉為立國之最高指導原則，以建民有·民治·民享之國家，鵠的既歸一致，國是於焉確定，此實為國家民族之大幸。茲距國民大會決議實施憲法之時期，僅有九月，一切準備程序，亟待與各黨派及社會賢達推誠矢信，共促完成，當此行盡在邇之時，對於行憲法規之制訂，人民自由權利之確保，舊有法規之檢討，與修正中央地方制度之確立，以及各級選舉之順利推行，均為樹立憲政規模之根本，本會議對於憲政實施之準備，另有專案決議，遠鑒民國初年肇事不慎之復轍，深念國家長治久安之重要，更認為地方自治基層工作之推進，全體選民對於國家責任觀念之養成，以及地方發展與國家統一相輔相成至理之確認，尤為我改組完成後之政府所宜特別注意之要計。本黨同志，一方面必當與各政黨開誠合作，相互提携，同時更應深入民間，負起宣傳憲政與喚起民衆之責任，務期我全體同胞，能真正發揮其民權，以奠立憲政開始良好之規模。</p>
<p>消除統一障礙　鞏固國家基礎</p>
<p>其二，消除統一障碍，鞏固國家基礎，抗戰勝利已還，其最為國家統一政治民主與經濟建設之障碍者，無過於共產黨之武力擾亂，國民政府政治解決之方針，寬本於國父大仁、大勇之精神，期以一貫精誠相感格，冀達和平統一之目的，稍紓刦後人民之痛苦。願去年一年之間，政府三次頒布停止衝突之命令，更復不斷進行軍事調處與談商，而共產黨迷信武力，背棄信義於政府屢次忍讓之際，在其割據區域內，竟實行全體總動員，最後又拒絕政府所下現地停戰之命令，拒絕參加國民大會，要求取銷國民大會所通過之憲法，更乘國軍遵令停戰之時，發動全面軍事攻勢，致使政府政治解決之方針無法實現。共產黨武力侵佔之所及，人民非被迫流亡，即慘遭劫殺，受禍之酷，非言語之所可形容，而國家統一，社會秩序，備受破壞，經濟之建設與復興，亦因其澈底破壞交通，而遭受無窮之阻礙。本會議集會之日，正共產黨軍隊揭開全面叛亂之時，深以國家不能統一，即一切政治經濟各建種設無由進行，而國家民族之獨立自由，亦失其保障，為維護國家民族之生存，為拯救水深火熱中之人民，本會議認為，國民政府對比武裝暴力集團之軍事叛亂，自不能不採取堅決迅速之措置，而予以遏止。今後政府改組，本黨仍當本一貫之革命精神，與各黨派共同協助政府，消弭此國家統一政治民主經濟建設之最大障碍。吾人認為，和平統一方針，應予擁護，而國家基礎與人民安全，亦必須有堅強之保障，久經征戰之將士，為救國救民而犧牲奮鬥，其勞苦實為吾人所欽崇，其目的惟在促起共產黨之覺悟，但使共產黨覺悟於祖國之不可背叛，人民之不可欺騙，武力之不可終侍，翻然變計，誠意悔禍，放棄武力迷夢，停止破壞工作，由非法的武裝集團，變為合法的普通政黨，從事合法的政治活動，則吾人深信，當共產黨以事實表示，使國家的統一民主與建設，獲得確實有效保障之日，即為全國人民與共產黨和平共處之時。</p>
<p>實行民生主義　穩定經濟秩序</p>
<p>其三，實行民生主義，穩定經濟秩序，今日國家生存，國民生計又一嚴重之障碍，厥為經濟之失調，我國本為農業生產自給自足之國家，近百年來夷於經濟上次殖民地之地位，國民政府奠都南京銳意建設，未及三年，天災人禍，相並而來。九一八變起以後，共軍之暴力割據，與日本之壓迫侵略，相為呼應，政府喘息不遑，不能致其全力於經濟建設，二十六年抗戰軍與，竭前方後方之人力，物力，悉用於禦悔衛國之戰爭，八載犧牲，僅有之經濟基礎，悉遭破壞，戰後一切財政經濟之艱危，與國民生計之困苦，乃為不可避免之事實，勝利以後，我國之經濟建設，既未能迅速獲得國際資本技術之充分合作，而經濟政策之執行，亦不免將經濟措施遷就財政需要，財政方針又祗能顧及目前之收益。演變至今，物價波盪，生產停滯，經濟秩序失其正常，失業者日見增加，有業者生活不給，本會議認為補救之道，惟有實行民生主義之經濟政策。國父創製民生主義之涵義，一曰平均地權，一曰節制資本，而更手訂實業建設之方略，發展國家資本，促全國國民努力於生產之重建。民生主義之目標，為提高大多數人民之生活標準，使全國人民享有均足之生活，故政府一切經濟政策，必須以大多數人民為對象，而財政政策與制度，亦必須與此一原則根本相配合，以財政配合於經濟，而經濟着重於生產。</p>
<p>我國總人口百分之八十以上為農民，根據民生主義之經濟政策，必須針對農民實際生活之需要，又必須根據農民所能生產之經濟力量，而扶助其充分之發揮。今後，尤宜依照過去所決定農業，工業平均發展之方針，使經濟復興與建設不偏重於都市，而普及於鄉村，而工業之建築，應植基於農業，但使全國人力，物力，財力咸集中於農工生產之一途，金融財政與生產政策配合運用，土地改革與農業改進得為有效之推行，則各種日用必需品與工業原料及出口物資之產量，必能日見增加，但使工業增產與發展，現有農產及農村工業同時並進，則吾國特有之經濟優點，亦得為有效之發揮，此不惟立自給自足之基礎，亦所以提高購買力量，促使國外貿易達於正常之狀態。更輔之以金融之合理管理，民營工業之獎助生產，資金貸放辦法之改善，合作組織之普遍建築。同時，全國一致誠意遵行經濟緊急措施之法令，則國家發行之通貨，不致造成充斥之游資，而少數遊資亦不致造成物價高漲之惡果，庶幾預算克期平衡，幣制得以穩固。本會議對於經濟改革具體辦法，另有決議，而其主要之點，在改變過去一般之觀念，以謀民生主義之實現，誠以今日經濟必先恢復常態，而後可以進言建設，必須把握根本，而後可以解決困難。又必政府確立信用，凡有關經濟財政措施之辦法，事前宜博訪周諸，審慎決定，一經頒布，絕不中途變更，而後可期國民以共同信守，深願政府與全國同胞共同勗勉，以促其實行。</p>
<p>求取獨立平等　致力國際和平</p>
<p>其四，維護國際正義，致力國際和平，吾國之外交政策，一貫以求得國家獨立，平等與促進世界正義和平為最高之鵠的，國父平日所靈示國民政府二十年來亦繼承而執行，其要旨均不外乎此。誠以我國立國宇宙之間凡五千年，其所以立者，蓋一本古訓「天下為公」與「親仁善鄰」之基本原則，而吾人所以自處處人者，為「不悔鳏寡，不畏強禦」之傳統精神，正惟有不悔鳏寡之德性，而後乃有不畏強禦之決心。惟仁惟勇，理實一貫，　者，暴日侍強侵略，吾人為保障生存，維護正義，即集中全力，與之作八年艱苦之抗戰，及其戰敗投降，則吾人又宣告不念舊惡之方針，遣送日俘，日僑，咸使安全歸返於國境，吾國此種精神，實孕育於五千年來之民族德性。吾國從無稱霸於世界之野心，亦決不因國際演變之紛紜，而依達俯仰，以自喪其所守。吾人之所重者為領土主權之完整必予維護，國際平等之地位必當難保，正義公理之立場必予尊重，本黨本於革命救國之經騐，深信獨立自主強盛之中國，為確保世界和平不可缺少之條件，而世界和平一日未得確實之保障，即中國建設必不能順利進行以達於完成，是以吾人之崇尚正義，為盡於天性，吾人對於世界和平之建立，又視為切身利害之所關。今日世界局勢，猶在杌陧不安狀態之中，然人類積此次大戰慘痛犧牲而得之智慧，應為確奠國際和平安全之主要力量，吾人所竭誠希望者，聯合國之組織能迅速健長滋壯，一切國際糾紛皆能根據聯合國之憲章，在聯合國組織範圍內，基於正義與條約，獲得圓滿之解決，吾中國以共同抗漲之一員，當一貫為友邦之互信互助而努力。更希望聯合國各友邦深明今後世界安危關係人類命運之巨大，以其高瞻遠矚之眼光，事事設身處地，推己及人，通力合作，無分彼此，以奠定人類和平之業，開創萬世太平之基。（下轉第二版）</p>

<p>充實教育內容　培養建國元氣</p>
<p>其五，充實教育內容，培養建國元氣，本會議於檢討國內政治，社會經濟各事項之時，所痛切感覺而認為中國建國工作中最大之缺憾者，莫過於教育設施之未盡充實與教育風氣之日趨空疏，我抗戰八年，學校，學生之數量雖有增加，而教育上所受之犧牲破壞亦最大，諸如設備之簡陋，經費之拮据，教育界人員生活之清苦，學生之輾轉流徙，以及衣食衛生條件之缺乏，此種有形之損失，已足影響次代國民身心之健康，而事之尤足痛心者，則為精神上無形之損失。自抗戰轉入後期，由於社會經濟之變態，貧富相去之懸殊，實際生活之煎迫，道德標準之喪失，一般社會風習頹靡，惟利是尚，篤實被視為迂腐，自愛被認為落伍，馴至我高尚清潔之學府，亦不勝現實主義之侵襲，甚或為投機主義所侵染，其機發於至微，其患乃為至烈，專心教育之人師，感孤掌難鳴之痛苦，血氣未定之學子，不能獲得篤實之修養，教者與學者之間，甚至與路人之相值，由是推演所至，於是短視者祗逐逐於低級物質慾望之追求，而比較優劣之青年，又往往成為政治鬥爭者爭取之對象，時代飛躍進步，而我建國命脈所寄之青年，乃敝精耗力於空疏無當之政治活動。建國需要高深之學術基礎，而今日多數青年中乃不免忽視基本學術之進修，建國須有專精之各種技術，而今日多數青年仍不能安心接受實際技能之培養，長此以往，將令一般青年不認識時代，不認識自身，不認識建國需要而自誤其極可寶貴之人生。本會議與念及此，不能不為來日之中國發生無限之隱慮，甚願我教育界關切國家前途之人士，對此現象積極補救。我政府亦必須重視教育，充實其經費，充實其設備，充實其教學之內容，使學生咸感求學之可樂，學問之可貴，而不致趨於空疏以自誤，更願本黨同志之從事教育文化事業者注意此一現象，而堅苦卓絕，為國家培養建國之元氣。</p>
<p>建國前途光明　必須克服困難</p>
<p>上述諸端，均為當前國家人民切身利害之所閦，亦為建國事業成敗之所繋，特為標揭，加以闡明，其他事項，具見決議。本會議集會十日，深感我中國建國事業前途之光明，和平統一民主建設方針之必能達成，此時誠有不少之困難阻礙，橫在吾人之前路，然古語有之：「精誠所至，金石為開」。過去八年抗戰，強寇終摧，戰後二年，憂患業集，亦正次第廓清，吾人誠能精誠團結，至公無私不分畛域，不分黨派，愈困愈厲奮勇向前，必能克服一切困難，突破一切障碍，竟國父之遺志，完成建國之全功。本黨許身革命，祗問責任，不利權利，茍利國家，生死以之自今以後，我全黨同志，惟當堅定信心，恪盡天賦，改正缺點，全力自強，服務人民，效忠國家，以追隨於我全國志士仁人之後，而求無負於國父與先烈，無負於抗戰忠烈與戰後流離顛沛含辛茹苦之同胞，此日之堅貞奮鬥即所以成就來日之燦爛莊嚴。僅此宣言。（完）</p>

<h3>國內政局的開朗</h3>
<p>三中全會連日討論當前的政治經濟軍事外交等項問題，不僅已分別通過重要決議，採取切實有效的辦法；而且這些措施，無一不是全國人民日夜所渴望的；所以這幾天來的南京，充滿了開朗光明的景象，使人人都感到國事前途的樂觀。惟三中全會決議的實施，當有賴今後的政府；是以改組政府仍是國人注意的焦點。昨聞政府與青年民社兩黨暨社會賢達，商談改組政府的事宜，業已獲得了長足的進步，商議完成了一種「共同施政綱領」，雖然尚未經各黨派的批准，但是這個共同施政綱領的內容，却含有非常重大的意義。據各報所載，其要點有下列十二項：</p>
<p>（一）和平建設綱領為改組後政府之施政準繩；（二）確切實行政治民主化，軍隊國家化的原則，以謀政治的進步；（三）中共問題應以政治方式解決，俟交通恢復，中共放棄武裝或接受整編時，協商解決；（四）實行責任內閣制，立法院開會時，行政當局必須出席說明；（五）行憲前行政院長由國府主席任命，但須得參加政府之各黨派同意；（六）各省行政本軍民分治之原則；（七）訓政時期為特殊需要所定之法令及所設之機關，在政府改組後，須一律廢止及裁撤；（八）整理稅收機關，簡化徵稅手續；（九）保證人民之人身自由及言論集會結社之自由，並須嚴格執行；（十）外交政策一律平等親善；（十）（一）外債之舉措應用之於生產建設；（十）（二）各省市縣參議員及地方政府，均須容納各黨派人士參加。</p>
<p>這十二要點，不僅是全國人民所一致要求的共同施政綱領，而且也是今後九個月過渡期內的重要憲章，我們相信全國各黨派，一定能欣然批准的。因為去年國民大會所通過的一部切實易行的民主憲法，至今年十二月廿五日，就要開始實施了，但從今天起，到實施憲政之日，只有九個月的距離了，在這樣短促的期間，要完成實行憲政所需的一切必要的準備工作，怎樣不要加速進行呢？所以我們老百姓從國民大會閉幕之日起，就眼巴巴的盼望着政府改組，立即開始進行準備行憲的工作，當時因為和談未能恢復，各黨派又躊躇不前，以致改組政府，延宕復延宕，一直到今年三月初，始見端倪，青年民社兩黨終於參加四機構（立法院·監察院·國民參政會暨憲政實施促進會），但是此舉僅能視為兩黨參加政府的先聲，而不能目為政府基礎的擴大。政府的真正改組，仍在國府委員會及行政院的改組。所以當時各方盼望政府改組仍極迫切，但是各黨派對於共同負起政治責任，終不免有所遲疑不決，乃祖繼表示至國民黨三中全會閉幕之後改組政府，現在三中全會閉幕在即，改組政府實也就刻不容緩的了。</p>
<p>至於我們老百姓爲什麽要這樣迫切期待政府改組呢？簡單地說，因為目前是國民黨結束訓政與實施憲政的過渡時期，準備實施憲政的主要工作，固然仍須由國民黨負責，但是政府的基礎不能不設法加以擴大，以容納各黨派領袖暨社會賢達參加進去，藉此表示國民黨確有還政於民的誠意與決心。同時在政府改組之後，又增加了一批新的血球，對於政治的革新及憲政的推進，必能發生相當的作用。但是政府如何改組？至各黨派參加後組成何種方式的政府？在民主先進的國家，自然沒有什麽問題，但是在行將實施憲政的中國，至少在技術上，必然的要遭遇若干困難。政府代表與各黨派領袖的撲樸風塵，不斷的往來於京滬之間，始終商談不出一個解決方案，其原因也就在此。惟政府的要求各黨派參加政府，各黨派的要求政府擴大基礎，雙方所處地位雖然各不相同，但是大家所抱的目的却是共同一致的。質言之，就是希望在這個青黃不接的過渡時期，完成實施憲政所需的一切必要的準備工作，使中國的政治走上真正民主的大道。只要這個目的能夠達到，不論國府委員如何分配？不問行政院所屬各部如何支配？政府與各黨派都可以沒有意見的，但是如何使各黨政都能相信，改組後的政府必能完成這個任務呢？在各黨派之間自然要有一個共同一致的施政綱領。這次商就共同綱領的目的，也就在此。有了共同綱領，只要改組後的政府切實施行，各黨也就可以不要問參加政府的成分之多少了。所以共同綱領的商就，實在是改組政府的初步成功，是值得我們慶幸。</p>
<p>最後，我們不能不指出共同綱領的最大特色，乃在仍以政治協商會所通過的和平建國綱領為改組後政府施政的準繩，政府與各黨派的重言聲明遵守政協決議，不僅可使攻擊政府破壞政協決議的惡意批評，不攻自破；而且也可以證明真正能夠遵守政協決議的只有政府與民社青年兩黨而已。本報一年餘來的社論，論及和談也無不以此為言。老實說，中國政治若不走上政治民主化軍隊國家化的大道，而盲目的徘徊於十字路口，是永遠沒有出路的。我們在政治協商會圓滿閉幕的時候，曾撰文為國家的前途慶幸；我們在中共企圖以武力擴充地盤而將政協決議破壞無遺的時候，也曾一再勸告中共切勿執迷不悟，否則不僅是中共自絕於國人，而且也足以陷國家於萬劫不復之境。所以我們到了現在，仍舊希望中共能大澈大悟。放下武器，政府決不致因光復延安而對中共強硬到底，只要中共有放下武器的誠意，政府必能竭誠與中共，恢復和談，仍以政治的方式解決中共問題。蔣主席在三中全會既曾宣佈國民黨準備自居於普通政黨的地位，昨天在中樞紀念週上又說，凡是國民黨黨員均須於今後的九個月充分準備，俾與其他政黨站在同等的地位，作政治競爭。中共如果也自認為一個普通的政黨，以主義相號召，一切均以民意為依歸，那末也應該放下武器，以正當合法的手續，與其他政黨爭取政權。即使因競爭而失敗，仍能保持其他既有的地位，以視中共現在以武力奪取政權，為全國人民所唾棄，不知要勝過千倍萬倍！但願中共能回頭覺悟，但願國內政局從此開朗而益趨光明！</p>

<h3>對德問題覓取妥協點　外長會進入新階段　英美外交政策完全趨一致</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿四日廣播：檢討兩星期以來四強辯論之結果，發現英美二國對德國問題持有相同之外交政策。在以往數次外長會議中，英美對德國附屬國和約之意見雖無無異趨，惟迄未有如此次之意見融洽者。四強今日休會，俾予特種委員會以調和並比較兩星期以來所提出之各項建議。特種四強委員會將於明日報告協議及衝突之要點，俾能決定今後應採之步驟。</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿四日電〕四國外長會議定明日復會，對於德國問題之外交鬥爭。將進入新階段，蘇聯與美英雙方均擬使德國政府，最有利於己方政體，故分別籌劃策略，務須德國政府之方式，與己方者相同。四外長代表同時討論德國和約，竭力工作，以期減少各項政治與經濟建議，並將已經商妥及未妥洽各點，呈報外長。美方要職稱，本星期係緊要時期，其結果將表明此次莫斯科會議對整個問題，是否可望獲得具體成就。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿三日電〕四外長會議今日起休息兩日，各外長均需整理兩週會議中之文件提案及計劃。美國務卿馬歇爾本日幾整日足不出戶，據其副官告稱，馬氏尚無會見史達林元帥之計劃。外長會議已歷兩週，馬歇爾及貝文均未提議會見史達林，而史氏亦未提議會見馬貝二氏，一般對此已開始表示詫異。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿三日電〕外長會議中四強意見相差之距離雖遠，但此間美高級官員於會議進行兩週之後，已表示「有限制」之樂觀。彼等認為目前即預料外長會議之結果，未免屬諸過早，但指出外長會議工作之進展，較　期為速。在短短之兩週中，除德國未來疆界問題乃美國解除德國國軍備之計劃尚未提及外，議程中所列各節，大致均會加以討論。各外長於下週起將遣行真正之談判，或可縮短意見分歧之距離，或可覓致折衷方案，唯有在進行數日此種談判之後，始可預料對德和約之基本原則有無協議之可能。</p>
<h3>對奧和約仍多爭執　僵局亟謀打開　奧代表將出席陳述意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕莫斯科廿五日廣播：今日外次開會時，曾討論奧地利賠償問題，蘇代表堅持南斯拉夫應獲得一億五千萬美金賠償，引起激辯，一無結果，決仍交四外長討論。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿三日電〕四國外次現正討論對奧和約，其中有十七要點，各方意見皆未能趨於一致。美國務卿馬歇爾頃對此提出一項建議，主張暫緩討論技術節目，先行獲致基本協議，俾可打開此僵局。據華代表克拉克稱：四國外次現正在草擬最後報告，俾便星期六提交外長會議討論，待後將聽取奧地利代表之意見。目前僵局之主要爭點乃奧境內所已被搬走之德國財產問題，蘇聯對此認為有權加以搬運，英美則力言不能加以移動，馬歇爾今主張暫緩討論技術問題，先行確定奧境內德財產之解釋，此議現將於星期二四強會議時提出討論。</p>
<p>茲分誌克拉克所列舉之各項爭端要點如次：（一）序文中有二條意見不能一致，即A其他國家何者可以准其參加簽訂合約；B美國並不視奧地利為敵國，則奧地利應否負參加戰爭之責任。（二）政治條款有六項意見未趨一致，即盟國與奧地利應否負維持奧地利獨立之義務，禁止合併問題，奧地利之疆界應否即以一九三八年之疆界為定則，或應否承認南斯拉夫之領土要求而加以修改等項。（三）軍事條款有五項意見未趨一致，即奧地利將否以其自製軍備，供應其軍事上之需要，應否禁止其研究或製造某種軍用物資，及盟國需否派一軍事代表團駐在奧地利，以監視其履行軍事條款等項。（四）除德國財產問題之外，盟國所不能同意者，尚有奧地利應否以原狀恢復聯合國在其境內所被軸心國劫奪之財產，及應否對聯合國財產所受戰爭之損壞，照價賠償等項。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿四日廣播：莫斯科真理報今日載稱：蘇聯已經取得作為奧國賠償之德國資產，其總數不逾奧工業總生產力之百分之十。在各項工業中，蘇聯所佔有之部份僅百分之二·三。該報譴責英美為　取奧國工業，意圖破壞有關奧國賠償之波茨坦協定。</p>
<h3>普遍裁軍問題　英美與蘇意見懸殊</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿三日電〕聯合國裁軍委員會定於廿四日下午開會。傳蘇聯已擬成世界裁軍之詳細計劃，但迄今猶不能證實此說。英美代表希望蘇外次葛羅米柯明白能提出若干具體建議。英代表賈德幹爵士及美代表瓊森均曾奉命反對蘇聯在最近將來開始裁軍之任何建議，蓋英美認為在訂定確實保障，乃聯合國建立「維持和平機構」之前，裁軍之舉決不可能。且在國際管制原子能成立之前，裁軍不過僅係希望而已。葛羅米柯對於英美之見解曾屢加嘲笑，並指此為帝國主義之論調。英美代表認為蘇聯所以力言迅速裁軍之　本理由，不外（一）掀起裁軍問題以阻碍國家管制原子能之進行，蓋蘇聯為反對美國原子能管制及調查計劃之唯一主要國家；（二）視為宣傳作用，利用裁軍問題在聯合國組織中取得主動地位，迫使英美追隨其後。為避免裁軍委員會牽涉原子能問題起見，美代表堅持劃定該二委員會間之明確界限，凡原子武器及集體毀減性武器統歸原子能委員會討論之。另悉原子能委員會將於本月廿六日起開始另一新階段之會議，託管委員會亦將於廿六日開始第一次會議云。</p>
<h3>胡佛竭力主張　復興德工業</h3>
<p>反蘇法破壞波茨坦協定</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕美前總統胡佛向杜魯門總統提出第三次德奧經濟調查報告，建議恢復德國工業生產，而消減其軍事潛力。並指斥蘇法二國所行德國之生產政策，實為破壞波茨坦協定，而英美在德國所行之救濟計劃，則在代德國向蘇法二國納付賠償，致英美納稅人所受之犧牲，每年達七千萬美元之鉅云。</p>
<h3>耶爾達密約規定　德俘勞力充賠償</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿四日電〕外務部長麥克挪爾今日在下院證實，三強在耶爾達秘密協定中，曾規定以德國俘虜之勞動力，作為賠償之一部分。</p>
<h3>美議員柯爾曼主張　對蘇採取經濟報復　並強調美國之和平政策</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕衆議院外交委員會委員柯爾曼今日提議美國「應揭穿蘇聯紙老虎，以其惟一懂得之手段，即經濟報復，加以對付」。柯氏並稱將於明日提出法案，主張對所有共產黨控制之政府，採取更堅強態度，美國不得向之貸款或給予其他援助。此項決案內容如下：（一）軍備祖借法項下所訂合同條件未履行前，所欠賑款不得取消；（二）美國對於任何政府未履行聯合國憲章者，終止各種方式之援助；（三）美國對於此稱政府不得貸予新借款，其已談判成立者應停止執行，以待其履行政治協定；（四）防止此種國家取得美國工業秘密及其他國防機要情報；（五）美國與其他各國對於王廠實習或參觀應取完全相互辦法，不得僅屬單方面行為；（六）美國應防止過分索取德國賠償，俾其得以自給，並終止盟國方面之救濟費用；（七）通告全國，聲明美國政策之目的，係在謀取與維持自由世界公正持久和平。柯氏承認此項法案係對蘇聯而發，惟亦謂若干國政府未能履行政治協定，於解放區舉行自由選舉。</p>
<h3>援助希土法案通過前　美擬先撥一億元　俾充作全部計劃之初步費用</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕杜魯門總統提議援助希臘與土耳其防止共產主義，刻在國會討論中，四月中旬以前，尚不克成為法律，然三月三十一日英軍撤離希臘之限期已近，故華府今日已有人動議，授權杜總統先向復興金融公司商借一億美元，俾得應付英軍退出希臘後之局勢。杜總統之計劃，共需四億美元以援助希土政府，並給予民事及軍事指導，暫時先撥一億美元，大致係充此計劃之初步費用，以填補英方退出中東後，美國未及插足時之餘隙。助理國務卿克萊登今日應召至衆院外交委員會，對杜總統計劃中款項，詳加檢討。同時參院外交委員會亦已開始研究此計劃，召代理國務卿文契遜到會陳述意見，民主黨參議員魯加斯稱：兩黨合作若能渡過此次試騐，預料杜魯門總統將邀請共和黨商討外交政策之其他問題。據觀察家稱：國務院公佈蘇聯對土耳其作「神經戰」之秘密文件，已使國會議員大受刺激，更將加緊努力，對杜總統之援助希土案，及早完成立法手續。</p>
<h3>艾克遜續解釋　美援希土政策</h3>
<p>目的在保持民主政治</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿三日電〕美國代理國務卿文契遜昨向衆院外交委員會宣稱：美國擬以借款四億美元貸予希臘與土耳其二國一項建議，其目的乃在維護聯合國之基本原則，協助各該國人民自決其政體，但美政府幷不欲使之採行美國之政府　慶。有詢以此項建議是否為「均權」政策之計劃，艾氏答曰：「希臘不但為世界上古國之一，民主政治亦起源於希臘，今該國正陷於經濟與財政之困難狀態中。吾人援助該國乃欲予立定腳跟之機會，以保　其民主政治。」或問美國此項計劃是否係針對共產主義或蘇聯，艾氏答曰：除對分化之勞力外，幷非對任何人之打擊，吾人幷不欲打擊任何國家，民族或政府，此舉亦非對任何政治意義之十字軍役，美國亦無維持各該國現狀之意。有詢以杜魯門總統之計劃倘不獲批准，則其結果將如何，艾氏答曰：余以為其結果必將使近東各國發生一種堅強感覺，以為美國不顧履行其維持自由民族與自由機構之保證云。</p>
<h3>英國全體紅星　會串五彩巨片</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南非開浦鎮廿四日電〕倫敦影片公司代表史蒂文孫今日宣佈：該公司即將以百萬美元拍攝一彩色片，描述南非洲之採金歷史，該片為壓到好萊塢之巨片起見，決定羅致英國全體紅星會串，包括費雯麗，寶蓮高黛，李思廉，霍華特，哈里孫及詹姆士馬森在內，導演為亞歷山大柯達。該片大部份將採取實景。</p>

<h3>泛亞洲會議開幕　尼赫魯稱頌中國</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里廿三日電〕泛亞洲會議本日在此間開幕，由印度國民大會黨領袖，即內閣副總理尼赫魯致開幕辭，力言泛亞洲會議之和平友好目的，而非反對歐洲或美洲。其言有曰：「吾人欲對於世界和平，有所貢獻。泛亞洲會議並無政治目的，僅欲增進亞洲各國間之友誼而已。吾人歡迎各國代表，對於中國及埃及，尤為敬仰，值得稱道。以言越南，該處正發生爭取自由之戰爭，由此可以證明自由非禮物，而須爭取，始能得之」云。惟阿剌伯·伊拉克·外約但以及越盟均無代表參加。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社新德里廿四日電〕頃悉：泛亞洲會議將設立亞洲學會，作為亞洲各國之永久連絡機關。</p>
<h3>我代表團長　鄭彥棻致詞</h3>
<p>〔中央社新德里廿三日電〕我出席泛亞洲會議代表團團長鄭彥棻今向該會開幕會議演說時稱：吾人對於議程中任何問題，能獲具體結論，並非重要之事，本會中最重要者，為吾人在坦白與真誠氣氛中，進行討論，此對會議之成功，至為有關。中國代表團希望此次會議，能使一切亞洲民族之福利，在經濟與文化方面，探求合作之方法，本團認為此次會議，係亞洲與世界其他部份之橋樑。鄭氏引用孔子之言：四海之內，皆兄弟也。明白將有其他代表團團長致辭。</p>
<h3>前關東軍參謀　否認扶植溥儀</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿四日專電〕前關東軍參謀片倉，今晨為日戰犯作辯護證人，於遠東國際戰犯軍事法庭中，否認關東軍曾致力設立偽滿。渠堅持溥儀係自動逃往東北，關東軍並未命令其前往。渠稱，土肥原賢二曾於一九三二年十一月九日通知關東軍，溥儀願從早前赴東北，為東北人民全體三千萬人及日人必須加以支持。據土肥原所發之另一電報，溥儀擬於遼東灣冬季凍結之前赴東北。片倉竭力為當時身任陸相之南次郎聲辯，謂陸軍省會嚴令關東軍勿干涉東北之恢復帝制運動。土肥原孫於改年十一月奉關東軍總司令本莊繫之命前往天津者，其特殊任務為　集平漢方面之情報，並試探溥儀之心意，並研究張學良一旦於長城以南有所行動時，所應採取之政策。土肥原尤奉命勿向溥儀作任何諾言。</p>
<h3>印末任總督　蒙巴頓就職</h3>
<p>即席演說呼籲各方合作</p>
<p>〔聯合社新德里廿四日電〕蒙巴頓今日在總督府杜巴廳宣誓就任印度末任總督，印度司法長官史本斯宣讃英王委任狀並監誓，禮畢，蒙氏打破前例，即席發表演說，籲請各方合作，於「今後數月內」設法解決印度問題。</p>
<h3>杜魯門下令肅整官紀後　國會已開始行動　擬扣政費迫令可疑份子黜退</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿三日電〕杜魯門總統昨日下午整肅官紀後，國會方面今日提議扣留政費以強迫黜退言行可疑不忠於職守之官吏。衆議院預算委員會已拒絕撥付調解局長華倫之政費，希望衆院加以核准。該委員會認為華倫曾加入「傾向共產黨之陣綫」，但華氏聲明不知此種團體之性質並已退出。一部份衆議員現且討論拒撥原子能委員會主席李林紹之經費。杜魯門總統任命李氏為原子能委員會主席，原曾引起責難。</p>
<h3>美發表希土報告書　列舉美國支持希土兩國之理由</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿二日電〕國務院頃發表有關希臘及土耳其之報告，其中指責蘇聯對希土兩國發動神經戰，並企圖取得控制並防禦土國海峽之特權。關於希臘之報告，表示相信英軍之駐在希臘，為防止南斯拉夫，阿爾巴尼亞及保加利亞三國政府採取侵略行動之主要因素，復曰美國認為若英國與希臘得成立協定，以塞浦魯斯習併入希臘，則美國願予贊成。美國贊成由希臘保持一九三九年之國界，但反對希臘要求取得阿爾巴尼亞之北埃比魯斯省，不過如果希臘向外長會議提出此一要求，美國並不反對。美國並贊成以杜特卡尼西羣島讓與希臘，但反對變更希保國界。此等問題，當於軸心附庸國和約生效後決定。</p>
<p>報告書復透露美國已開始與希臘談判友好，商務及航海條約，並已知照英希兩國，反對英國建議之設立希臘商務社團計劃。美國認為根據一九四二年之英美協定而實行之希臘軍事占領，對希臘是有穩定的效用。美國最近已向希政府建議擴大政府基礎，容納不論是否參加本屆議會之各希臘忠實政黨，但企圖破壞希臘獨立之極左派，及拒絕與真正自由份子合作之右翼反動派，則主張予以摒棄於政府之外。</p>
<p>報告書復透露近數月來駐希英軍數額大減，已不復能被視為作戰部隊之組織，英軍駐希人數，不久將減至六千人，故英軍駐希僅具政治上及心理上之效果，對於防止南保阿三國侵略希臘一點，或有相當效用。該南保阿三國，對希臘均見惡感，並有土地野心。由於希臘軍力之單薄，故希臘之北鄰三國，不論單獨行動或獨立行動，若無國際上之顧忌，均不難奪佔希臘之一部份土地。若南保阿三國之軍隊侵入希臘而與英軍發生衝突，則政治局勢必致更趨嚴重。報告書繼曰：美國認為希臘之國民解放陣綫，並不足以代表民主的希臘，且覺希臘共產黨及其附屬團體，實為對希臘國家之嚴重威脅。共黨控制之武裝部隊一萬三千名，實力殊與缺乏訓練，待遇惡劣之希臘政府軍不相上下。</p>
<p>報告書最後復表示：美國對於因希臘與其北鄰間之兩難而產生之安全問題，深為關切。美國認為此一安全問題，與美國本身之安全問題，亦具有基本關係。（按杜魯門總統，馬歇爾國務卿及艾克遜副國務卿之公開言論，雖未明指蘇聯之名，然美國國會所接獲之正式文件，則直指蘇聯不諱，指責蘇聯向希臘發動神經戰，蘇聯對希臘現政府具有敵意，並向聯合國機構之希臘局勢調查團施用阻攔手段。）</p>
<p>關於土耳其之報告有謂：土國自覺對於蘇聯已陷入極困難之地位，蘇士緊張關係，迄今未趨鬆弛。蘇聯繼續企圖享受控制並防衛土國海峽之特種，乃使修改蒙德　公約之談判陷於僵局。蘇聯對於土國東北部之若干軍略要地，具有野心，土國深盼能使國家恢復政治常態，開始軍隊之復員，及國民經濟之復興，然其全國人民團結一致，莫不力主反抗外侮，深信中東土地之完整及國家之獨立，為世界和平所必要。美國以金融放款給予土國，足以保證其主權或領土完整之免受威脅。</p>
<p>報告書於述及海峽問題時謂：土國堅決反對任何足以侵害土國海峽主權之條約修正，然蘇聯則似已決定參加該區之控制及防務。關於蘇聯之要求卡爾斯區及阿達漢省。美國認為無論在歷史上或法律上均不足以證明其要求之合理。蘇聯之目標，在保護高加索田區之安全，取得波斯灣之出海口，並壓迫土國使成立迎合蘇聯心理之土國政權。</p>
<p>報告書復謂：喬其亞蘇維埃共和國，對土耳其東部土地之要求，並無種族上之理由可言，且喬其亞之要求，並牽涉今日整個蘇聯與中東之關係。</p>
<p>報告書之經濟部份謂：土國必須保有鉅額軍隊，其軍費支出超過全國全部收入之半，故其經濟狀況殊為困難。土國與蘇聯之貿易幾已全部停頓，美國已成土國之最好主顧，同時亦為其供應之主要來源。</p>

<h3>央行同人購金查實　襄理主任等多人　受開除記過處分　同豐餘售賬冊全部送法院　警局未允兩部調查人員調閱</h3>
<p>關於金潮案中，央行同人購買黃金一案，業經該行　核處澈查竣事，所有同人購金名單及數量，並已調查確實，呈報該行總裁，交由人事處分別議處。茲悉，業務局襄理王松濤，副主任王元淸·尤　棣，辦事員　達夫四人，已予開除。此外聞尚有多人，亦經分別予以記過及警告之處分云。</p>
<p>（本報訊）轟動一時之金潮案，自監察委員提出　幼，林鳳苞楊安仁詹運生等被捕，林楊暫釋辦理移交，詹解送法院　押聽候訊辦以來，　已沉寂多時。最近財政部方面，對於此案忽又重行調查，財部參事賀其　，審計部審計范士興，日前　命抵滬。昨日下午至警察局訪行政處處長方志超及第四科科長徐幼祚，要求調閱前經濟騐察團金鈔組澈查所得關於詹運生承辦中央銀行配售黃金之全部賬冊。但警宗局方面認為本案案卷人犯旣已解送法院辦理，則警局應對法院負責，不能將賬冊交與其他機關，故未允所請。雙方交涉數小時，賀參事與方處長先後以電話與地院查長接洽，最後決定依據手續由警局將同豐餘金號詹運生服冊先行移交法院，如財部需要調閱，再直接向法院洽辦。所有賬冊當由徐科長於下午五時半親自送至地院。按此次中央銀行配售黃金舞弊情形，經濟監察團調查甚詳，監察委員提出之彈劾，大部即以此為根據。</p>
<h3>加緊調騐烟民　預期兩月內　全數可完竣</h3>
<p>市政府日前接內政部電，滬市烟民已經登記未予調騐者，尚有四千餘人，未登記之烟民，應加緊查緝。市府據此，當即調令市警察局遵辦。警察局已將辦理情形舉報市府，略調全市登記烟民共為六千零六十人，依解規定，於卅五年七月一日起，開始調騐，因上海市烟毒調騐所，床位有限，收容人數無多，分批計為一千二百二十五人，兩共三千六百零五人。未經調騐烟民，實僅二千四百五十五人，其中死亡遷徒，或住址不實，無法傳案者，為數亦多。現正由衛生局指定市立公立醫院十五所，協同烟毒調騐所辦理調騐工作，一面由本局督飭所屬各分局，查明未騐烟民，分批傳案送騐·預期兩月內，必可全數調騐完竣。至未登記之烟民，歷經枯局督屬嚴厲查緝，不稍鬆懈，核計緝辦烟犯，截至本年一月底止，共為二千二百六十四人，仍將督飭所屬認眞緝辦云。</p>

<h3>上海監獄工廠　囚犯努力生產　一座五層樓的灰鈀大廈　包括各種不同製造工場</h3>
<p>〔本報時寫〕舊時代的監獄，使犯人的肉體與精神都受到很大的磨折。出了監獄之後，使好人變成壞人，壞人變成更壞的人，社會永無寧昰。現代監獄則完全採取進步的措施，不僅消極的懲罰，而且積極的感化，使壞人變成好人，使無用的人變成有用的人。不僅有食住都顧到衛生和舒適，並且訓練其工作技能，使第一個人都有一技之長，將來出了監獄之後，也能成為社會中生產的一員，而不是社會的寄生蟲。當我參觀了上海監獄工廠之後，益讚嘆現代監獄的地是步與合理。</p>
<p>工廠位於監獄辦公室的後面，是一座五層樓的灰色大廈。入門見有「靜肅」，「守秩序」，「靠右走」的標語。工廠上工時間早晨六時三十分，散工時間晚五時十五分。吃飯時間：上午七時五十分，下午二時。工人均着灰鈀囚衣，編有號碼，無固定工資，以工作成績計算。一樓北面為製鐵工廠，工人十五名，分別以黑鐵及白鐵，製鐵管鐵桶等物。南面為糊盒工廠，工人二百零五名，代中國，黎明，大中華，一等火柴廠，糊製火柴盒。每人每日可糊盒四百雙至五百雙。每日出品最高可達七萬盒。二樓北面為工廠辦公室，南面為木漆工廠，工人四十名，分製桌椅箱子及沙發·製成後由漆工上油漆·委託者多係木器商店。三樓北面為搖砂工廠，有用電力開動之機器六部，南面為毛巾工場，有手搖木機八十二部。惜因原料棉紗尚未獲配，以致兩處均皆停工。四樓北面為印刷工場，工人八十四名，有大小機器二十部，所承印者多為司法行政部狀紙，印成後每二千五百張紥成一包，寄往南京。南面為排字工場，工人三十九名，分排字，插字，派字，校對，鉛版，　膠，鑄字，鉛綫等各部門。五樓北面為裝訂工場，工人六十三名，分做信封，裝訂簿籍，糊火柴盒，及套印表冊中之紅藍色綫條。其中有硬面精裝會計薄冊一種，頗為精美，亦全部由該廠工人製成者。南面為縫紉工廠，工人七十名，有縫紉機器十九部，分製中裝·西裝·　裝·手套·布鞋·皮鞋。</p>
<p>匆匆的走馬着花巡禮一周，每一室中均有管理人員，着黑色制服，對參觀者詳為解釋。犯人均埋頭工作，愉快·靜肅·緊張。假如我忘記了這兒是上海監獄，絕對想不到他們是失去了自由的人。「衣·食·住·工作」，人生的四大需要，在這兒都解決了，雖然有一點缺陷——沒有自由。</p>
<p>餘款靜肅緊張只是沒有自由</p>

<h3>讀者咨詢　醫藥衛生</h3>
<p>（一）久喘不愈</p>
<p>朱光華問　鄙人年已十七歲，但仍未發育，骨瘦如柴，時患氣喘，藥石無効，刻經X光檢查，知肺中有一黑點，但亦不見有其他肺病症象，請問（一）此疾是否為氣管支炎抑或肺炎？（二）此疾對於發育上有否影響？（三）此疾用何藥能根治之？</p>
<p>〔醫學博士唐仁縉答〕由來函所述各點觀之，可確斷為氣喘，所以與氣候亦有關係。茲將所問三點解答於後：——</p>
<p>（一）絕非肺炎，經過中曾患氣管支炎，則未可知。（二）對於身體發育不無影響。（三）發作時，除服鎭喘藥外，可用Anto　Vaccin或Asthmolzsin。轉地撩養（氣候乾嬠，如平津等處）有時亦奏良効。較難，但發育成長後，有時亦可根治。</p>
<p>（二）隻眼生翳</p>
<p>林永明問　敵人於去年患紅眼，歷月餘始愈，但自是即視物模糊，曾經專科醫師診治，云係角膜翳，須長期塗藥始能退去，但迄今仍無起色，不知應如何治療？</p>

<h3>白煤塊堅俏</h3>

<h3>關於貸疑及推銷辦法　出口茶商提出意見　央行與茶商交換畫面　洽議後呈行政院核准</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕三十五年度外銷茶葉。自經中央銀行召集中國農民銀行，中央信託局，及有關各茶商會議，洽定解決方案後，（詳情已誌三月十三日本報）茲悉：本市茶葉輸出商業同業公會，刻已正式致函中央銀行，根據該日洽商意見，提出改辦「打包貸款」及集中推銷辦法四項，內容如次：中央銀行飭中信局領導各茶商代表，組織推銷委員會，將全部箱茶輸出推銷，二，請中信局舉辦百分之一百二十打包貸款，除償中晨行抵押借款本息外，餘款交由茶商支領。三，未經抵押之全部祁紅，屯綠，平綠餘額，及溫紅，溫綠，寗紅，祁紅副貨花香等，亦一併同樣准予貸給打包放款。四，推銷所得售價，除開支外，按照現行匯率，結成法幣，償還打包貸款全部本息。餘額以七成歸各茶商結領，三成交中信局。茲聞央行亦已據情函覆，對第一項無異議。對第二項所指「打包貸款，」持聲明係屬商業行爲性質。即將來茶商不能藉口外銷茶葉無法銷畢，而不淸償貸款。對第三項未經抵押之全部祁紅，屯綠，平綠餘額，約四千担，准予一併列入打包貸款中。其他如溫紅，花香等，則尙待請示劉副總裁核定。對第四項央行認爲推銷所得售價，應除收購成本（即收購原案所訂定之價格），及打包貸款利息，及外銷費用後，餘額再以七成歸各茶商結領，三成交國庫。以上央行與茶蘭交換之響面方案，如獲洽議，尙待呈准行政院後，方能施行。</p>

<h3>銀樓業開聯席會議　商討如何復業問題　推代表赴市府及社會局請示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自財政部另訂銀樓業收兌及製造金飾管理辦法十條後，本市銀樓業及平·津·蘇·浙·粵·鄂等地同業留滬代表，特於昨日下午四時，召開聯席會議，共商新管理辦法公布施行後，同業如何管業問題。據該業會後發表消息，略謂，自金飾處理辦法公布，全國銀樓業同時停業，曾二次向中樞有關當局提出理田，陳訴苦衷，已荷體卹採納。茲財部另訂新管理辦法公布，對本業請求各地中央銀行配給原料一節，尙無答示。而該辦法第四條規定，仍有隔閡。蓋：（一）將來金飾收兌，必難平衡。結果祗有兌出而無收貨，造成求過於供現象，本業實感不安。本業向抱薄利主裝，進出價格距離，不希望太遠。使符合實際情形，庶旣顧客樂於購兌。（二）關於主管官署核定價格一節，希望以迅捷簡化爲原則，由本業公會呈謮備案。故本業開業時間，須與主管官署商討後，方可決定。現聞該業已推定姚蓮芳，姚桂卿，吳彭年，陳德彰，裘雲艮等五人，携呈於今日上午分赴市府及社會局再行請示今後營業問題。</p>
<p>又聞南京方面銀樓業，今亦會問皖湘兩地代表會議，商討今後營業問題，並將向社會部等機關請求修改辦法云。</p>

<h3>純碱铔令已到</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：本市純碱銷路轉稀，永利公司由天津運來純碱四百五十噸，無法容納，已分運漢口·汕頭·重慶等處。硫酸铔，銷令已屆，下內門貨甚缺，永利亦因南京硫酸铔廠已經停造，存貨不多，廠盤頻頻提高，每噸爲三百萬元，市塲銷路已呈活躍，但最大主顧台灣帮，尙未蒞滬採辦。</p>
<h3>紬油市塲岑寂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨市桐油無大量做開，間有期貨賣買，爲數亦微。足度白油速桶價爲四十四萬元，少實銷。西洪客銷尙好，每桶八三市斤，昨市價爲三十七萬元，似稍俏升，敖洪無甚軒輊。</p>

<h3>光復前　延安花絮</h3>
<p>— 太原十四日航訊　黃河</p>
<p>頃自關係方面獲得中共冀晋區黨內秘密指示文件一份，略謂：「目前我黨之基本任務，在推翻國民黨一黨專政之國民政府，業握政權，建立無產階級專政。為了完成這個總的政治力量，各地必須全力支持軍事勝利，積極完成動員民兵參戰及擴軍歸隊工作，摧燬社會統治力量，嚴厲打擊優村地主富農，及士紳階級，造成農村混亂，農民騷動，以加重國民黨各級政府之困難，减低其威信，阻止頑軍（指開軍）之補給，並必須以各種形式，各種口號，動員人民反對園民黨之獨裁統制，反對美國援華。嚴格執行食糧物資封鎖政策，普，還性的破壞被頑軍視同生命的鐵路交通，全體幹部必須堅決克服和平觀念，準備十二年的武裝鬥爭，對於人民普遍的厭戰的心理，應該擴大「以武裝爭取和平」，「不推翻國民黨統制不會有眞正和平」口號之宣傳，動員力量，深入普　的予以逐漸改變。」</p>
<p>此一秘密指示文件，誠不啻對其發動戰亂，破壤和平，及各地一切陰謀罪行之眞實自供！</p>
<p>又承來自延安之青年文化工作者白沙君，以其日前脫稿之「延安雜感築」見贈，記者研閱之餘，不勝感慨。綠「延安」前曾自詡為中國新文化之自由園地，但一般拓荒在這塊自由團地上的文化工作者，却這到難堪的輕視與打擊，以至連吸呼的自由也莫得，現實使他們悲觀失望苦悶，中共却更陷他們的生命於慘淡的境地，這情形以深知中共內幕的人們看來，是一些也不感覺着意外的，可是就一般未得深刻了解的讀者，的確有再加冷靜的觀察的必要，特此撿抄「雜感彙」中有關文化人在延安各節，以賽遠方讀者：</p>
<p>「野百合花」多刺　「八月鄉村」不幸</p>
<p>作家王實味，骨頭總算得是最硬的，中共雅會給他加戴了所謂「國特」「日特」「特派」三種頭銜，但一般人俱諧稱之為「三科」，但他却多少不為惡勢力所屈，所以一直到今天，他仍被監禁着，而他那多刺的「野百合花」也猶在深深的刺痛着中共。</p>
<p>再一位繼王實味而後，較有骨頭的人，就要算「八月的鄉村」的作者　軍了。記得當「文藝家和政治家」正鬧得烏烟瘴氣的時候，他却大胆的來了次冷水澆頭，大駡是「狗打架」藝術家的本能，他是發揮了，但隨時加重了生活壓力，却使他不得不在延安新市塲上擺小攤，當妻子的產期將屆時，這位作家竟發生了無米為炊之虞，若不是幸遇天涯知己的牧童哥，日給小米半斤，恐米待「新陳」而他却將「代謝」了。「八月的鄉村」何如此其不幸也！</p>
<p>李又然索磁牙　陳鐵耕得瘋病</p>
<p>翻譯家李又然，到底有九分「老氣橫秋」之概，當他被所謂「羣衆」們包圍了鬥爭的時候，空氣固然是那樣緊張，但他却始終鎭靜如常，毫不顯示懼色，站在主席合上，一個勁的向大家表白不是特務，結果在被人家「五花大綁」起來大打一頓之後，他仍還要求主席賠償他被打掉了的磁牙。</p>
<p>在同樣鬥爭情形下，木刻家陳鐵耕可被這一驚，便得了瘋病，整天便頭　腦的見人就笑。按說，陳這是歷任董責的一要角幹部，但他的氣度的鎭定力，較之李先生則差多，這也許是他的年歲更老了的原故。</p>
<p>黑丁被迫清算　長虹挨當頭棒</p>
<p>黑丁被迫得交了「特務」關係還不算，還要强制他去「魯迅藝術學院」去報告特務史。他在無可奈何情形之下，竟指稱艾音胡風茅盾等都是國民黨的特務，並說國民黨眞有錢，這些人完全是被大量金錢收了的。當時眞說得許多人都哭笑不得。</p>
<p>此外，前「狂颼社」的老詩人，高長虹，為了追求「革命眞理」，竟不惜跋山涉永，歷畫長途艱辛，從大後方跑去延安。一入「陝甘甯」邊區境內的固臨，即被當地縣府扣起來，幾經解釋，終未獲釋，結果是被押送延安。一去就被中共以「特務」監視起來，理由是「魯迅曾經駡過他」。二次當人們正在悶聲悶氣的開着整風討論會時，這位白髮　然的老實人，突然顛破血流的出現在人們的面前，高呌「碘酒碘酒」！這位「新來客」，因被人指為仇恨共產黨而挨了當頭棍，從此以後，人們即再也遇不見高長虹，也再沒有看到過他的「政治詩」。</p>
<p>「無聊」磨肚皮　春風送來歌聲</p>
<p>正因為文化無聊，故而在延安風行着「土風舞」。每當體拜六之夜，一些精神苦惱，生活極端無聊的文化人，與靑年學生們，便成羣結夥的在院子里或月下的曠野平地上，相樓着跳舞，隨着單調的二胡伴　，有的竟然跳個通宵，老鄉們見了，不禁啃然嘆日：「為啥磨肚皮，還磨得樣帮勁？」豈不知這般先生們實是無聊，不行呀！</p>
<p>光復前的延安門呈着一片荒凉的景象，每當漫天風沙的朦朧底月夜，寒空中時常盪漾着靑年們的歌聲：「有人抱着老婆，有人在悲觀失望」，還有由「抗大」校歌所改編，「黃河之濱，凍死了一羣，中華民族，倒霉的子孫……」也不時由春風吹送進人們的耳鼓。</p>
<h3>談聯總行總社會福利工作會議　並檢討行總過去一年急賑福利事業（下）</h3>
<p>— 德偉　詹德垕</p>
<p>在食的救濟方面，除發放糧食外，還在難民住留區或糧荒嚴重區設立集體供養站，難民可來站就食，站的種類很多，有粥廠，平價食堂，營養站，和饅頭大餅發放站，各分署設立的數目均在八站至七十站之間，總計有138所受惠人數8,379,426人，此外湖南，上海，南京，湖北，廣州，厦門，汕頭，山東利用澳州運來的活動廚車巡迴各難民衆多之地區，愈便他們就食，這種廚車一個鐘頭之內所備的糧食可供六百人果腹，在冬振的時候，廚車將備就的飲食，放在幾個固定的沾口許多無以為炊的家庭領着孩子，帶着器皿，來站盛領回家。　除了普遍的衣食救濟外，為解決難民回籍後住的問題，行總曾撥給湖南，湖北，江西，河南，廣西五分署建設專款，分別在各破壞最嚴重的城鎭或農村，建造平民住宅或善救新村，其餘各分署也在業務費內撥款修葺民屋或利用軍用帳篷搭蓋臨時庇寒所和難民宿舍，在江西對於住的緊急措施是以工振方式組織難民，用泥土做矮牆，用帳篷做屋頂，組織起帳篷村來，為難民自己住，村內有福利實施衛生管理，為節省人力，財力，這些工作是組織村民，　他們自治分署只擔負供給物雙與指導的責任。</p>
<p>（一）安置失依兒童</p>
<p>失依難童的安置，原則上是有家者歸家，有親者還親，使其重度正常約有溫暖的愛的生活，行總會遣送隨着家庭還鄉之難童二十一萬餘名，又協助戰時兒童保育會遣送二千二百五十六名保育生還鄉，確實無家無親可歸者，由各分署與地方原有社會福利機構合作設立失依兒童臨時收容所共十五處，收容兒童八千餘名，委托原有保育院所收容者五千餘名。</p>
<p>（二）促進兒童營養</p>
<p>行總利用聯總過運華的牛奶魚肝油從去年九月以後，還設營養站，用去物資二萬噸，又加配罐頭食品，湯豆粉麵粉等，將一部份營養站改為供應站，以發動兒童營養補助運動，在總署聘有專家事司指導各分署，營養物資之使用方法及兒童飲食的調配，行總的目的，一方面是補救兒童在戲建康上的損失，一方面是要讓這般貧苦的父母，知道是什麽才是兒童飲食的最底標準，（牛奶同魚肝油當然不在此內）然後他們才知道努力去追求那人類應有的東西，現在行總共設有一千八百七十二站，加上所補助的小學營養站的數字，則為二萬餘站，供應二百餘萬兒童在行總結束的時候，我們希望政府與提倡營養的社會機構共同合作，繼續發展這種工作，俾一般貧苦兒童能享受他們應有的權利。</p>
<p>（三）舉辦勞働婦女　日間托兒所</p>
<p>各分署為配合工作委托當地有關社團辦理貧苦勞働婦女托兒所，猶其是在災區利用這些所來安置兒童，同時無形中安定了無數家庭，以免他們成羣結隊跑往另一個分署所轄的地區，而引起行總行政上一些困難，年輕力壯的父母，在工振工程上去工作　了，孩子們都予以免費養育，在安頓設置的托兒所，佔最多數為四百三十三所，托兒二萬八千一百四十五名，其他分署一共只有十五所，兒童入千人。</p>
<p>（四）設立兒童福利站</p>
<p>營養站及日間托兒所很自然的，就發展成為兒童福利站，在可能範圍之內，分署盡量的把一個城市分成許多區，在每一區內，委托與行總合辦托兒所或營養站的機構，多照顧他區內的貧苦兒童，而成為一個兒童福利站，辦理物資發放醫藥衛生敎育娛樂家庭生活指導，這工作以北平辦得最好，各分署已共有一百七十三站，約有兒童十一萬餘名，然而這制度，還只是在萌芽中，希望將來致府能將全國各城鎭及鄉村，都劃分為兒　福利區，每區設中心站，辦理區中一切兒意縣利事宜，使這種辦法能成為一種永久的制度。</p>
<p>（五）機關補助及改善</p>
<p>受行總補助的機關可分為公私立救濟院孤兒院安老院殘廢敎養院及其他社會福利機構，其宗旨在使收復區原，有的老幼殘廢等救濟機關復原並配合行總工作增加收容名額，補助的方式，可分為衣食物資之供應協助修　現金補助和人才訓練，物資與現金的補助，都採用遞减的方法，使能逐漸設法自給，各分署已補助之機關共有二千一百七十八單位，其中兒童機關為五百三十一單位，兒童為六萬人，此種工作以上海分署辦得最多，所補助之機關共有一百三十七單位，其餘各分署皆在十五至六十單位，之間行總又規訂受補助的機關辦理行政及業務的標準，以助其逐漸改善提高我國救濟福利事業的水準因為行總的生命太短暫，這件需要長期方能收效的工作沒得着很多結果，但這種標準的定訂在中國還是空前的一個舉動。</p>
<p>關於安老卹殘工作，除補助安老卹殘機關外行總己開始做二個試騐目的，都是要使殘者不廢自立更生，獲得身理與心理的治療，恢復身心健康，並予以職業訓練，使其能重正常的心理興社會生活，這二個試騐的不同點在方式，一個是用新式的科學設備，外籍專家來協助社會部舉辦傷殘重建院，行總先後共以四十四萬業一百元的美金，代為在美採購器材，另就行總原己運華物資中供給必要器材，另一個方式是與中華職業敎育社會合作，利用城市中原有的醫院普通的商店及小工業，作傷殘者訓練與職業的地方，這種方法是在我國任何城市，不須很多的經費，可以實行的，行總只是利用它短暫的生命，開創一個永久性的工作。</p>
<p>八年的苦戰後，行總在我國這偌大的災情背景上，投上以上這幾筆救濟福利工作，的確與背景不稱，常然一方面的原因，在聯總行總對這空前的國際性與全國性的救濟工作太乏經騐，但另一方面的原因，是內戰的續生，交通的阻困政洽情勢的複雜，經濟的不穩定，在這種環境之中，任何一個組織，都不能將善後救濟的任務，美滿的完成，經騐告訴我們說，社會福利工作，不能單槍匹馬的去解決社會問題，專門只注意福利工作內，忘記這整個的政洽經濟的制度，很容易的福利工作，就成為不民主的政治與官僚資本制度，後面的情道夫，作編刊工作者的眼光要放大些，時時不要忘記你的工作必須與政治經濟的改進並肩邁步的。</p>
<h3>滬記者團　抵杭垣別記</h3>
<p>— 本報記者屠培林</p>
<p>兩路鐵路管理局此次邀滬市各報記者去杭　　　一行二十二人於二十日晨出發。抵杭後，除參觀之江大學，錢　　　，及赴各處名勝遊覽外，並曾往訪沈主席及周市長等地方首長。　　　因適赴京出席三中全會，當由雷秘書長代為接見。廿二日　　　　　待，席間並詳告浙省行政設施及經濟現况。</p>
<p>雷秘書長　談行政設施</p>
<p>雷秘書長稱：浙省目　　　　多，最大為財政。本年預算共五百餘　　　　約短少一百億。收入方面最大者，為　　　　稅。田賦省得二成，其餘八成歸中央，　　　各半。本年行政設施方面之主要工作爲海塘工程，去年已耗　　　　其中四十億由中央撥助，二十億爲聯總之物資及麵粉，本年　　　　一百十鐿，中央為此已數度派員勘察，諷為非地方所能負担，　　　以錢江發源自安徽而大部流經浙省，及惠及江蘇之松江等縣　　　，請求由中央撥款，現中央正在考慮中。此次工完竣後，最　　　　能自杭州南星橋載貨出海，此予浙省商業繁榮太有裨益。</p>
<p>陸路交通　積極推進中</p>
<p>陸路交通方面，浙贛路三月一日已通至義烏，最近期內可直通金華，六月底，可能自江山向西通入贛省。公路方面，京杭國道已通至宜興，滬抗及杭徽路最近亦可通軍。另有沿海自甯波通溫州之綫，正在積極進行中。另計劃擬經魔水，溢州等地而入福建，如能完成，頗多方便。該項公路修復所需，規定由中央負責，但去年因撥款少，故進行緩慢。本年中央預定撥一百億，至今已領到十億。農田水利工程，本年擬完成一百餘處，計畫中者尚有五百餘處。如能完成，糧食生產加倍。對一向缺糧之浙省，當能彌補。</p>
<p>注重特產　絲茶及漁業</p>
<p>浙省特產方面主要爲　絲茶葉及漁業三項。今祗恢復及戰前十分之二三。去年蠶絲申請貸款二百億，結果祗撥一百十億。本年希望能貸一百五十億，以積極恢復桑園及改良蠶種。茶葉去年申請貸款七十五億，因國內交通阻滯及茶農資金週轉不靈，外銷欠佳。本年目標希能生產十五至十六萬担，每担成本五十五至六十萬。申請貸　　　　以積極恢復市塲，現正　　　　皮廳長與四聯總處接洽　　　　方面，勝利後希望能由　　　　捕漁之汽艇及造木船用之木料。經接洽結果，已允撥木料一千噸，目前一切凖備工作均已完成，祗待貨到即可運用。汽艇則祗能借用，不能取得所有權。本年漁業貸款申請六十億，中央已允考慮。</p>
<p>公敎人員　均勉力職守</p>
<p>杭州過去物價指數超乎南京之上。但中央規定公敎人員之待遇，京滬為第一等，杭州被列入第二等。所幸皆能相忍為國，勉力職守。黨政軍及社會各界名　，因地方人口少，貝面機會多，故意見容易貫通，彼此密切合作，同心合力。以往發生米荒等情形，遂能於短期內解決，而民意機構之參議會，亦能與行政機關合作，彼此同為謀公衆福利，相處融洽，工作易於推動。</p>
<p>周市長談　杭州市現狀</p>
<p>杭州周市長日前接見滬市記者問團，談杭市一般情形，並答問稱：抗市人口於民國廿六年時統計達六十一萬，今祗約五十萬。抗戰期間，全市受損甚重，房屋被毀者佔百分之三十。敵偽搜羅一切鋼鐵五金材料以供軍用，即陰溝蓋亦遭搜刧，致渣雜沉積，排水不暢。勝利後進行此項疏濬工作，頗為困難。敵偽遺積垃圾達二十三噸，四百淸道夫工作至今，殆已淸徐完畢。西湖之電燈欄杆亦遭破壞，裏西湖汚泥淤積。復員後，陸續修理至今，外表多已恢復。戰前委員長曾下手諭，必需每隔一年粉飾一次，每隔兩年油漆一次。勝利後第一步工作祗求其復原。</p>
<p>市府預算　一百五十億</p>
<p>市府總預算百分之三十，係撥作工務局建設修路等用，本年預算共為一百五十億。兵役去年中央規定杭州為六百八十五名，全數招足。今年尚未辦理，名額不詳。工商業一般情形不佳，上海行情利用長途電話，十分鐘即可傳至杭州，故受影響甚大。工人工資計算與上海有別、多以米或錢規定而不依生活指數計算，禁無縣問題頗難講，參議會旣決定要禁，則就禁，周市長表示，　「好在杭州不靠跳舞來興旺，禁了無所謂。」</p>

<h3>國畫風氣好轉</h3>
<p>— 朱應鵬</p>
<p>進珊兄為春秋「美術節特輯」微文，希望檢討過去，策勵將來。我近來雖則不廢研究，而深感工夫之不足。對於發表意兌，實在缺乏勇氣。</p>
<p>姑就記元以來三十餘年問，國畫風氣的變遷，略抒所見</p>
<p>民國初元的畫風，祗是亡淸末流（任伯年等）的尾闆。積習難移，無論其造就如何，總脫不了「江湖氣息」。或因畫手多居通商大埠，為庸耳俗目所拘，不得不塗紅抹絲，以「俗賴」一路，草率敷衍。尤其是上海，在半殖民地買辦文化的狀態下，產生不出崇高偉大的思想及製作，不足為怪</p>
<p>話雖如此，規代印刷業的發達，是大有助於國畫的進步的。不少熟心提倡美術的人十，利用印刷，影印古代名蹟，推廣流傳。風氣旣開，漸使研究國畫者，得見前賢矩度，而耳目為之一正。</p>
<p>國民政府建都南京以後，北平故宮開放，所藏珍品，亦復影印流傳，並經幾度舉行展覽。因之研究國畫者的觀感，更得以逐漸提高。</p>
<p>國畫風氣，逐漸傾向純正，即在此時。惟初時眼光尚淺，祗能認識明末淸初如八大石濤一流，不拘　墨的作風。但另一方面，則多數畫人，拋棄花烏的時習，而追求山水，却形成了山水畫的特別發達。</p>
<p>抗戰時期，雖干戈遍地，而國晝却有顯著的進步。這是很好的現象。加之，近來山水畫的研究，已由元明而規撫到唐五代北宋。格局趨向謹嚴，筆墨趨向工整，設色亦趨向鮮明潔净，漸有規矩法度之可見。表示出現階段的國畫，至少已具振作氣象，而不再是墮落的。</p>
<p>從此精益求精，發楊光大，由模倣的範圍而進於創作，由山水而及於其他部門，由研究本國美術而及於世界美術，則前途不可限量了。</p>
<p>文化影響國運，這是顚撲不破之至理。故從國畫風氣的好轉一點而言，國家前途，是希望無窮的。即以此義，慶祝本屆美術節。</p>
<h3>團結·努力·爭光榮</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>去年今日，上海美術協會在康樂酒家正式成立的時候，宜言上說：「希望全國的美術家們團結一致，共同努力」！現在已是足足的一年了，不但未能完全實踐盟約，表現成績；相反地，尚有少敷份子，為着滿足個人的自私慾而不擇手段，用盡陰謀，將藝術當做商品到處招搖，因而貽笑各界，受人輕視，乃至引起參議會都認為美術是「不必要之敎育塲面」，「藝師」之先被撤銷，後被歸併，亦不無影響罷！</p>
<p>在堅苦的抗戰期間，多數貞忠節烈的藝術工作者於大後方，於戰地，尚且能够一心一德，互助合作，那種蓬勃的精神，迄今想來猶令人振奮！詛料勝利後的現象，反而有這樣惡劣的趨勢，着實痛心！</p>
<p>「美術」，決不是一種人生的點綴品，也不是歡樂悲哀時藉以娛情消愁的工具，它是人類不可或缺的一種精神食糧，無論文明蠻野的民族，都各有其美術的表現。尤其在我國，它具有敷千年光輝的歷史，已為世所共知。歷史告訴我們：時代的巨輪是不斷的向前轉動的。目前面臨着偉大的時代，一切都應該展開新的局面，配合着時代前進才是。而唯獨美術一門，在今日中國偏偏顯得格外的寥落，從事美術工作者允如晨星一般的稀而又少，並且還要各自為謀的不能相與合作，因之藝運的力量永遠是薄弱，至今仍不為社會人士所注意。如果，老這樣的現象繼續下去，不但無法保持歷史的光榮，恐將　為鳥有了。</p>
<p>在大家興高彩烈的今日，我們應該表示一個決心——立即放棄門戶之見，手與手緊緊地拉起來，共同向前邁進</p>
<p>再說今日中國的美術，雖然較諸過去退步，未能盡愜人意的地方，所在皆是。但，我們有着一個極大的希望，希望培養更多的靑年作者，希望他們負起重任，來建設新中國的新藝術事業！無論某種事業的建設與發展，都會有其社會制度的不同而各異其趨向的，祇有藝術為例外，它無論在任何社會制度之下，其重要性絕對是一般的。猶如人體中的細胞，在任何階層，任何種族的體質內，都沒有須臾離開或消滅的可能。</p>
<p>有人說：美術只是有資產的人　能享受的。換言之，如目前的中國現象，好像是不可能的了。殊不知當蘇聯大革命的時候，其提倡美術運動反較諸平時更為熱烈哩！設得近一點，日本在戰時，藝術工作者和新聞記者不但可以免去兵役，而且一批又一批的加緊訓練，派到各戰地製作，並受到親王般的優待，這又是什麽理由呢？</p>
<p>總之，我以為任何運動，任何事業，一方面固然需要國家來提倡和督導，一方面還得工作者彼此團結和努力！「內亂」「內戰」是自趨滅亡的。</p>
<h3>美術節感言</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>美術是人類感覺美的要求，生命力量的表現，社會生活　的縮影。美術家是世界光明的引導者，是爲尋求正當人生而研究美術，為表現個性和思想而創作。可是，我們因為處在事變叢生的世界，生活困頓的環境中，加以物質文明，炫惑了人們的視綫，人們對於精神修養，似乎是一天墮落一天。生活機械，功利是岡。要是長此下去，不圖補救，不特是我國美術的致命傷，且是劃破人類文明的刀斧呢。</p>
<p>談到我國的美術，從有歷史以來，只有在最近的二十年間，由公家主辦過大規模全國性的展覽會三次。然而這三决的開會地點，也限於上海，南京，重慶的一隅之地，雖然盛極一時，欣賞的究屬少數。而古代美術品的展覽，也是寥寥可數。或以為各省市常有公私的古今美術各部門的展覽，也可以差强人意，聊勝於無。無如這些展品，多是屬於商品式陳列，甚至有的眞偽雜陳，醜劣充斥，與有系統的研究觀摩的性質不同，和純粹的為藝術而藝術的也相異。加以各地舊有的美術品，未能够好好的去發掘，保管，珍藏，週遊展覽，反而有些因着剽竊，佔有，而發生掉換，私藏，盜賣等行為。甚至為着個人應酬或貪些小利，把公私的珍品，售（送）給國外，也不在少數。至若不加愛惜，任其傾毀與摧殘的，更不勝枚舉了。</p>
<p>日本降伏，至今已經一年半有多了，時期不能說是不久，岡書刊物的出版，也多恢復常態。可是環觀全國還沒有一種定期出版的純粹美術刊物，不能不說是中國美術界的遺憾。</p>
<p>美術岡書坊間以前雖然有過幾部出版，但是，嚴格的說起來，質與量也不見得怎樣的充實，何况其中有些是由外人的著作翻譯而來，並不是自己的著作。研究本國歷史上的美術，而要從外人淺薄著作負販過來，當作正確詳盡的珍貴資料，這樣，在文化學術上，別人雖或不輕視鄙薄我們，而我們也够可憐可慚愧了。在近幾十年來，我們對於美術最大的收穫，恐怕是金石甲骨文。詔版竹簡的研究，敦煌石室的發見吧。可是，我們看看日本，他們對於美術的努力，研究考證的書籍，不計其數。其中的材料，多數的屬於我國的公私所有品。而我們呢，絕不搜集甄選整理分析研究來編印，却讓他人多方的研討羅致來完成。難道我們眞的謹守着：「君子成人之美」與「成功不必自我」的敎訓麽？</p>
<p>美（藝）術專科學校，在全國的敎育中，統計起來，連公私立的恐怕不到十所。而這寥寥可數的藝校，試問有幾所是內容充實，設備豐富，能適應够敎與學的實際需要的呢？經費的不充裕，設備的貧乏，成了普遍的現象。加以敎職員的旅進旅退，常常更勸，主持校務的常因經費人事，奔走各方，虛耗大部分的精神與時間。凡此種種因陋就簡與損失，是無法補價的。</p>
<p>衣食住行這是人類日常生活的共同需要。但是性靈的啓發，生命的寄託，國家民族偉大的表現，則需要美術，却有許多人（包括政府在內）把他漠視了，所以蔡孑民（元培）主張「美育代宗敎」，美育的重要可知了。假使人們只靠衣食無缺，便算是美滿的生活，恐怕沒有如此的簡單吧。希臘，羅馬的文化，幾千年遺留至今，還是燭照世界的火炬，自有他生命力量的存在。反看我國的現在：美術學校的稀少而不完備；美衛館沒有一所；大規模的美展，等於「神龍」的一現，各地美術建築，沒有切實的保管整理，任它毀壞荒廢；國家社會對於美術創作，沒有廣大的實際去扶助與獎勵；美術圖書刊物的出版，異常荒陋貧乏，國際的美展宣傳不多見，間有一二，質量也不充實；美術批評沒有建立，有時雖有些發表，但是嚴正公允的則比較的少，博物館美術館等缺乏，藝人研究參考無從；美術家的生活多數是艱困；有些只研藝一年半載，便即舉行藝展，博取斗升；同時也有治藝數十年，而作品沒有出路，弄得一貧如洗，朝不保夕；美術團體的工作不能充分展開，尤其是與國際美術團體沒有密切聯繫。這些現象，在今日的美術節說起來，都不　令人有無限感慨而長太息的。</p>
<p>怎樣的糾正社會的風氣，怎樣的建設新的美術，這是要賴國家和社會的力量切實去努力，不是一二人能够做得到的事。偶然感想所及，特為拉雜的談談，希望能够針對事實的補救過去與現在的缺憾。明年的美衛節，另有一番新氣象，這不只是我個人所企望的吧。</p>
<h3>紀革命黨人之畫藝</h3>
<p>— 梁烈亞</p>
<p>談到我國畫藝，恐非一篇一章所能詳畫。所以我不作老生常談，特將範園縮緊，祗紀創建民國的革命同志之畫藝以告國人，共致以永久之追念，而師其「革新」「創作」「自由」「獨立」之精神；同時用以紀念美術節。</p>
<p>有熱情，有智慧，有修養和慈祥的人，才肯犧牲小我舍身救國，加入革命同盟去革除釀惡勢力；所以革命黨人之善繪畫者，其筆墨不是氣韻高逸便是神情慷慨，絕無盜取虛名臨模抄襲之作品。各人都能奔放暢達的使用自己的筆　，將各個之慧根法露出來。就我所知的略述如下：</p>
<p>史堅如，陸皓東之花卉山水，豪邁渾厚，出於自然，無澀滯沉重之疵。國父嘗說：「堅如聰明好學，眞　誠懇，才貌英姿與陸皓東相若，而二人皆能詩能畫」。</p>
<p>陳少白，潘達微筆墨情高，松風月水未足比其淸華；而章法　造能變平波為奇突，化餘唾為璣珠，故能不同凡俗。</p>
<p>蘇十穀　皆寫生，綫條淸勁，氣韻空靈，所畫都為表現其「亦狂亦俠亦溫文」之靈性，上達仙境，不染塵埃，天分之高，今不再有。李叔同始為奔放，後作簡淡，畫境甯靜，如處女秋霜，惜不多作。</p>
<p>譚延　，章綘偶以書法寫蘭竹佛像，亦蒼勁得神。</p>
<p>高嗡寫生，寫獅虎馬猿鶯雁等，甚至小動物小花葉均以得傳其神靈為止；山水下筆縱　。不用鈎勒，亦能寫出風雨晴明之天籟眞景，是以最能動人。滿淸之季，當與其兄崙首創「眞相畫報」於上海棋盤街，不徒用以鼓吹革命，實開我國刊發畫報風氣之先。歿時國府主席林森同志當題其墓碑曰「畫聖高奇峰之墓」。</p>
<p>林文年少畫竹，楚楚有致，心靈情態流露其中，不肯依傍別人。</p>
<p>經頤淵亦喜畫竹，節少淸勁，已達高逸境界，有如其人。</p>
<p>張澤善畫馬，允好為山君寫眞，有能「畫皮及神」之譽，但其所畫人物，亦極能傳神，我嘗見其在黃山為許疑菴寫照，又為陸丹林卅壽畫佛像，均可稱能品。</p>
<p>蔡守所作，氣韻鬧淡，但不仿南田，亦不畫倪迂，隨意洛筆，感覺敏銳；其情操高雅之　趣，躍現紙上。彼要張傾城拜蘇子榖和尙爲女弟子，但畫不師其師，反好着色爲花卉及山水小幅以自娛。</p>
<p>陸煞塵興到便寫，意境蒼茫，不知有古，不知有今。</p>
<p>此外現尙健存爲我所知者，有張人傑，高崙，何香凝，李梄雲，李鐵夫，田恒，何遂，陳樹人諸同志，亦均能寫出有生命之作品，而自成其家格，與衆不同。</p>
<p>道是由於熱情與智懸而來，所以能不受他人畫法所拘束，各各自尋其自己所有之天地，對於世界人生　由獨立之美術境界。才能有其新的之　　。</p>
<h3>美術節放言</h3>
<p>— 賀天健</p>
<p>我是國畫作者，亦即美術作者之一。請言我國畫：</p>
<p>有人問我曰：某言國畫已亡。我還問曰：某能畫國書否？曰：能，然則國畫未亡！</p>
<p>有人問我曰：某言國畫宜改良，非吸收西畫之長不可，然則如何？我莞爾笑曰：亦可，但不要忘掉了國畫的長處。更不要弄錯了中西畫的長短。</p>
<p>有人問我曰，日：實則今日國畫極盛！據報上文章所記的凡名大畫家，不知有多少。何以還有人說衰落？我日：是的確有畫必家，有家必大。你不看路上有栗子大王，魷魚大王嗎？王旣無物不稱，盡安得不家而大之？退一步言：凡人能向上，總是好！也不必去看他不起！</p>
<p>我在二十年前發了一個狂，要望舉世之　　作者，法意天代兩宋之繪畫法度與精神，曾大胆地呌一個口號—復興五代兩宋山水畫法度與精神恩同再造創作之路徑。—這個口號喊出後，曾有人來問我，你旣然要創作，為什麽要兜一個大圈子，拿五代兩宋的法度與精神來做路徑。我說：法度是外形，精神是內容，五代兩宋的作者他有以上所美術家之精神他有師造化而自出機杼之法度。我認為度者天地間不易之定律，法者由人思想所得之結果。以法而運用度，為五代兩宋山水畫家所成功者。我們應研究其如何而得到度，如何而生出法；更如何而為五代兩宋山水畫家之法度。須知那時的山水畫尚有眞元之形氣。</p>
<p>元明淸初則繁鎖加多，雖挍法已臻乎極致，後學者淺測薄探，不易得其奧秘，使浮光掠影，僅有皮毛之獲得耳。故欲覓取前人之創作路徑，非從五代兩宋入手不可</p>
<p>我再解釋我對於荊，關，董，巨，至黃，王，倪，吳，而董至四王之見解；我以為董，巨至黃，王，吳及四王中之烟客，湘碧，麓台為一個人；我不曾見其為幾個時代幾個人也。荆，關至江參，及四王中之石谷為一正支，荆，關至倪雲林及新安派中之查梅壑，為一別支。然而也可並兩支為一個人，不必分其時別其人也。我國畫中之山水畫，雖創始而至完成，亘有千餘年歷史；但一究其遞總之跡，並未劃一時代而有新的發現；不過一脈衍施，迭相改良而已。</p>
<p>凡事至登峯造極，如可再透越其度級而上者，則縣盧無憑，惟有下墮而已；淸乾嘉後之四五支派遂至一蹶不振即此故也。三十五年前吾鄉廉南湖等切意另尋路徑，乃有提倡石濤，石溪，新羅，冬心諸人寫意一派，由文明書局刊行以上諸人畫册甚多，為改易風氣之謀？吾鄉吳觀岱與海上兪語　盡力倣摹石濤。吳較兪為勝，有時竟能亂眞，我三十餘年前亦喜石　法。後因此路只可墨戲而已，遂決心研討五代兩宋人山水畫之理論與技法。</p>
<p>世人稱我書畫作者之生活必日淸高，榮譽實甚；良由古人之堅貞淸白自守而來。明明好招致名利，而他竟不肯坐收浪得之名利，如吳仲圭乃有「待五百年後人論定」之誓言，其守品用功有如此者，大凡以前之成功者無有不如此。看現在如何！唉！再如古人之一稱友朋，無不忠信相敦，如石谷之與南田，我人一閱南田詩集，每每油然而發思古之情，嘐嘐乎何今之不如古耶，今日美術節特鄭重表而出之，望我同道大家更宜相互珍重！</p>
<h3>畫牛</h3>
<p>— 土進㻚</p>
<h3>博愛與唯美</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>愛是心靈中的一滴甘露，神經中樞的一顆細胞，黑暗中的一綫曙光，無分上智與下愚，人類與禽獸，都是與生命俱來，等到軀殼毀滅方去；得之則生，失之則死。宗敎家崇拜上帝。因爲他創造了整個宇宙和萬物；到了近代，神秘主觀的思想，已失掉科學的根據，發揮這種偉大的力量，恐怕屬於博愛的領域罷。聖賢豪傑，志士仁人，他愛萬物，愛人類，愛世界，愛眞理，有才博愛的精神，方才有偉大的貢獻和創造。古今中外的至人，為什麼有這般傻勸，一言以蔽之，他們屬於　愛眞理的神經反　。</p>
<p>的釋義是形態的完善，聲韻的和諧，感官的愉快。美的創造，是拿人類的缺陷，心靈的空虛，情感的激昂和抑鬱，加以開拓宣揚和充實，喚起同情或贊賞。屈原的離騷，李杜的詩歌，二王的書法，大小李將軍的繪畫，菲特亞斯Phidias的彫刻，悲多芬的業曲，美所表現的境界，是屬於整個宇宙和人生，因此美所創造的成果，給予人類的恩惠，不受時間和空間的限制，不分種族和國家，歷萬古而長新，具有永恒的價值。</p>
<p>愛的反面是厭惡，憎恨，仇視，美的反面是醜惡，卑劣，殘缺，人為萬物之靈，最高的德性是眞，善，美，因功利主義極端的擴張，人性變質，浩成世界的紛擾，人類的互相殘殺，繼續不斷的在人生舞台上演，構成「反其道而行之」的惡果。</p>
<p>博愛的精神與唯美的創造，是含有普遍性的大公無私，悲多芬的樂曲，幷不限於日爾曼民族才能領受欣賞；米開朗琪羅的彫刻，不專屬於意大利人始可撫摩瞻仰；李杜荷馬的詩歌，幷不拘於中華民族與希臘民族始能領略玩味。一九三六年十一月倫敦舉行中國藝術展覽，會期延長至五個月，震動了全世界；東方藝術的莊嚴華妙，偉麗精工，深印在西方民衆的腦海裏，因為藝術品的欣賞和創造，不限於種族和國家，他的貢獻是屬於人類全體。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>空中小姐</h3>
<p>— 玨人</p>
<p>「空中小姐」，這一個漂亮的名詞，近來呌得很響，可惜她們僅僅是服侍有錢有勢的人們的「僕歐」而已。中國航空公司對於機內的設備務求盡善盡美，不肯讓乘飛機的人在犬空中太寂寞了，所以要招考漂亮的空中小姐去服侍他們。</p>
<p>條件是第一要大學畢業，第二要通曉英語，能和英美人直接談話，第三要會講廣東話，第四要會講北平話。而最要緊的還要身體健康，且不僅健康而已，而最最要緊的還要有健康美，這就難乎其為「空中小姐」了。</p>
<p>做優等民族和高等華人的一個女當差，其不容易也有如此。此外，還有一點須附帶聲明，中國的飛機設不定長隨時曾出事的，做空中小姐的須有「要錢不要命」的決心，準備以身作殉，使坐飛機的人即使在萬一之後也不至於寂寞，於是空中小姐之任務才算完成。</p>
<p>有人當心這樣的空中小姐在中國恐怕很難找得出，即使找得出，她們也應該拿出那些已備的條件去做一些比較更有意義的事才對。其實這些倒是次要的問題，最大的問題，據中央社紐約二十日的電訊，中國最大的上海航空站，也因缺乏設備而將失去遠東的航空地位了。</p>
<p>如果眞成事實，那即使我到了許多中國的空中小姐，也只好向國外送了，難道「空中小姐」們眞願到外國去常洋女僕歐嗎？唉！</p>
<h3>正經的笑話</h3>
<p>— 而比</p>
<p>時間：中華民國三十六年三月二十日。</p>
<p>地點：上海。</p>
<p>一份申報的售價：國幣六百元（外埠另加郵費）。</p>
<p>那天申報本埠版上的一則新聞：老閘警局破一賭窟，拘獲大批賭客絲商張銀先等共十五名，經偵訊屬實，各罰一千五百元釋出。</p>
<p>再算一算：一千五百元，等於二份半申報的代價，可購大饅頭三隻，或陽春麵一碗，或七塊半大餅，或一包不大高明的香烟</p>
<p>於是，我的一位朋友就想向這十五位絲商建議：以後想賭，何妨先到老閘警局每人預存一筆一千五百元的罰金？</p>
<p>或日：一千五百塊錢在現在誠然嘸啥希奇，但在戰前却可以買一宅小小的房子了。故老閘警局此舉，倒頗令人發思古之幽情</p>
<h3>大票及其他</h3>
<p>— 陸沉</p>
<p>五千元大票，一旣不否認亦不承認」的發行後，居然是「印者疏忽」，連「號碼」都「大有出入」了。一者可以代表「中國印刷事業之精益求精」，一者也可以看出「鈔票之值錢」，「萬一」二者都遭「否決」，我倒要看看負責者將受到何種之「適當處分一？</p>
<p>三中全會改革幣制議起，猶太風最澈底的上海，揣測。議論紛紛，但是我先拿我自己來說，這些問題都屬「紙上談兵」，第一，是我自己本身就窮，第二，問人借了錢來對付過柴米油　，三天之後又「窮」，第三，自己不能生產，那末當然是結果還「窮」，有三個「窮」字速上一串，縱然眼面前「改革」「改革」，究亦非救「窮」之道也。</p>
<p>「禍從天上來」之身受者，雖將「淸單」開出，巨細不遺，但是按着我們「公事公辦」的「官風」來說，我可以担保它「必須」經過下列：「審查」，「調查」，「仰祈鑒核」，「俯予照准」，「准予存查備案」，「核行辦理」，以及「等因」「據此」「奉此」，……等傷紙張耗筆墨的「手續」者，就能領到「號碼各別」五千元大票的「賠償」，那才怪咧！</p>
<h3>大庇寒士盡歡顏　—記會文正公愛才之二</h3>
<p>— 愛菊</p>
<p>當文正旣克金陵，即簡　兩江，軍事粗定，乃合四省書局，會同仿刻汲古閣十七史，而以刻兩漢史記三國為前提，是時校對需材，堂兄以一燈謎之猜中，亦得分校一席，先君會述海寗耆宿葛先生一事，益見公之愛才，固葑菲不遺焉。葛先生為先祖老門生，且有聲於庠序，文名噪一時，迨中更洪楊之亂，年亦垂垂老矣。性善滑稽，詩賦文章，咸出以游戲之筆，頗似仁和之繆蓮仙先生，居家仍設帳，而館殼不豐，生計甚困，以先君之在會幕也，郵寄一新梓詩集，且託於杭州省會，覓一枝棲，意欲以詩集呈之文正，為先容焉。先君以集中各詩，每間以俚詞市語，呈之師座，深慮諧而不莊，顧以文正亦素好該諧，平時論詩，以詼詭諧適兩穗為上乘，且云：非惟可以破悶發笑，且能濬發神智，陶冶性靈，因將詩集置之案頭，且於封面加跋焉，一日文正因事詣先君，乃袖之而去，翌日語先君曰：「葛之精力如何？能來秣吾？」蓋公極賞集中蒙館新婚二詩，密密加圈，且於新婚詩末聯，重加硃圈。</p>
<p>其蒙館詩曰：「一陣　雅噪晚風，諸徒齊逞好喉嚨，趙錢孫李周吳鄭，夭地玄黃宇宙洪，千字文完翻鑑略，百家姓畢理神童，其中有個超羣者，一日三行讀大中。」</p>
<p>新婚詩曰「願作鴛鴦不羨仙，高燒紅燭照華筳，果然的是前緣矣，無所用其客氣焉，這般這般何便爾，如此如此竟公然，明朝相視還相笑，心照大家都不宣！」兩詩皆妙，而新婚詩末聯，允傳　阿堵。頰上三毫，無怪公之特加欣賞。先君對以葛先生情力甚健，可以來秣，公即加扎，任以書局總校，緣局薪水分三等，最少六十金，中等人十金，最高則百金，葛先生乃得上等薪可謂幸運兒矣。今之文人，末路者多，常軸亦有如文正公其人，大庇寒士盡歡顏乎？</p>
<h3>藝文壇</h3>

<p>雷石檢在高雄任國擊報副刋編輯，發表中文及日文詩甚多，最近出版「八年詩集」，及再版二本日文詩集。</p>
<p>歐陽予倩在台，除担任新中國劇社導工作外，　醉心於閩劇的改良。但自立二二八」事件後，台灣省　歐長官公署宣傳委員會　　銷，屬於宣傳委員會的新中國劇社，或將脫離官方關係，在台另圖發展。歐陽氏可能返滬一次。</p>
<p>自台省宣傳委員會撤峭後，本屬於其下的台灣電影製片廠，可能有獨立之說，將拍故事片以維持開支。</p>

<h3>「某夫人」</h3>
<p>— 衛瀚</p>
<p>一個退休軍閥的夫人，在一個偶然的機會中，見到了她從前唱戲時的情人。表面上，現在他是從國外歸來的富商，實際却正從事於製販假鈔的勾當。他抓住了從前的一段關係，屢决向她敲詐，最後假鈔案破，又逼着她一同逃走，因而被軍閥發覺一切，結果流氓被警局捉去，某夫人則在發表了一篇「覺悟」的宏論後，離開了她的家庭。這就是「某夫人」的故事。</p>
<p>固然，我們不否認，一個簡單的故事祗要有好的分幕劇本，與有才能的導演處理之下，也一樣的可以產生一個優良的作品。但我們所可看到了的「某夫人」的影片，却令人失望得厲害，劇本的空洞牽强，形成了先天的喪弱，導演者的低能，更造成了後天的失調，全部故事由極突然的巧合中開始，接着七拚八湊的堆砌了許多勉强，不合情理的片斷，最後用一條硬加上去的「光明的尾巴」做為結束，胡蝶的轉變，反抗，以灰覺悟，究何所依據，常她走出了余家的大門，她又將走向何處去？銀幕上全沒有告訴我們，恐怕就連編劇者同導演本人也無詞自解吧。還有像洪副官那樣的一個銀隨了余師長二十年的隨從人物，竟會像一個衝動的靑年學生似的，痴情而又笨拙的向師長夫人求起了愛，我們實在驚異於編劇者與導演對於實生活中社會人事觀察的貧乏和愚昧。</p>
<p>這一大堆的牽强，荒誔，不合情理的東西，實難一一詳舉。編劇者「閉門造軍」的把它們造了出來，導演者也就以「連環圖畫」的姿態把它們搬上了銀幕，此外是硬加了一些像：「走路頭硬向墻上撞」一類可厭的「噱頭」。</p>
<p>雖然，胡蝶的演技，仍然是有望的，那位演師長同流氓的兩個演員，也是可造之材，但在這張片子中，却都被糟踏了。錄音技衛同樣的草率。</p>
<p>對於「某夫人」的攝製，除了認為該公司的製片人，想到用這個「老牌影后」而投機發一筆財之外，我們想不出其它更好的理由了，</p>
<h3>東條和近衛的子弟</h3>
<p>— 𣏌人</p>
<p>最近，美國的通訊社曾發出了二則消息。這些消息在表面上似乎不大重要，因之，許多報館裏忙於處理草斯科會議新聞的編輯先生，就把這兩條輕輕投進了字紙簍。</p>
<p>這兩則消息都是和日太有關係的。第一則是說，日本警察在出動逮捕全國流氓的時候，在一節火車的角落裏抓到了東條英機的胞弟。戰事失敗，東條就擒之後，這位肆無忌憚的首相的弟弟竟也已淪為雜氓了。</p>
<p>第二則新聞是：近衛文麿的兒子已到莫斯科，正在受嚴格的共產主義的訓練！</p>
<p>日本人是一個心理上有些變態的民族，他們感情浮動，以能自殺為勇敢，以不惜含辛茹如苦，終至報仇雪恨為道德上最高的成就。在幕府時代，家臣為主復仇，得手後慷慨切腹的故事非常普通，而且在流傳的時候，還加上了無數英雄主義的色彩。元祿十四年（一七〇一）赤穗浪士大石內雄等四十七人為城主殘野長矩復仇，襲殺淺野的仇人吉良義央後，四十七人全部切腹，日本人至今奉為武士的龜鑑。我並不是歌頌這種「武士精神」，我祗是要喚起大家的注意：一個民族，經過幾百年來這種敎育的　陶，對民族心理上是必然會發生相當深切的印象的。</p>
<p>因之，我們對戰敗的日本仍不能不嚴加　備，密切注視。東條約兄弟是淪爲流氓了，日本的「流氓」也，就是我們早就領敎過的「浪人」。日本浪人是有組織的，他們的力量比我國的帮會强大得多，「黑龍會」是一個例子。不要忘了我們在載前吃過不少浪人的　——九一八事件不就是浪人們首先下手的嗎？</p>
<p>近衛的兒子去做共　　了，這更有政治性的「出亡」的氣息。一旦用得着這塊愰十，隨時都可乘機而動。愈是美蘇之間外交關係似很緊張，他這着棋子下得愈是其心叵測！不少日本人在戰後的著作中，還對近衛獨多恕辭，故以號召而論，這塊近衛招牌，倒實在並不是一文不值的！</p>
<p>這兩個人象徵了日本當年統治者的下塲，也埋伏了異日我們或者會遭遇到的隱憂。日本人善欺騙，善脅肩諂笑——可是，讓我再重複一句：日本人是以能報仇雪恨爲最高榮譽的民族！</p>
<h3>「聖女之歌The　Song　of　Bernadette」</h3>
<p>為福斯去年度最偉大出品之一，公映後曾獲電影協術科學院五項金獎像，女主角琴妮佛瓊絲係一新人，為「去年度最佳女演員。」此片即其成名作。「聖女之歐」原著為法國現代作家弗朗茲之暢銷小說，其故事在歡美業已家喩戶曉。現片已抵滬，即將在國泰獻映。曼</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「你瞧她長得好看嗎？」老徐也很明白這位風流浪子的心意。</p>
<p>「美極啦！」小沈忘形地讀美着，眼睛發光。「就差似乎太驕傲……」</p>
<p>他的話沒有說完，院十裏。傳來了熟習的口嘯聲，吹着熟習的調子。</p>
<p>「5111，5271，5144，321712……」</p>
<p>「老祝意了」，胖子放下了酒杯喊。他和　協理同時回過頭去，望着那通走廊的門。</p>
<p>小沈佛然不悅。</p>
<p>「他媽的，這個怪物！唱了十幾年的婚禮進行曲，至今還是一條光棍！」</p>
<p>當老祝的瘦長的身影給屋子裏的燈光，漸漸在走廊裹的牆上映出來的時候，徐胖子便放開嗓子大喊：「快來喝一杯四年陳的UB！老祝！」</p>
<p>可是老祝沒有來得及回答，他的身子才走近門框，天空裏就傳來了一聲汽笛的刺耳的長鳴，接着又是第二聲，第三聲…</p>
<p>「警報！警報！」屋子裏的人同聲高喊起來，但神情並不緊張。</p>
<p>祝兆年的左腿已跨進了門框，向大家笑了一笑；突然，他身後傳來了一陣急促的足音，還夾着女人的尖銳的語聲。</p>
<p>「……先要找到緋緋，她不知道上那兒去了，偏偏空曆又來了……」　　失却了平時的那種鎭靜的常態，急得說睡都變了聲音。</p>
<p>金愛麗手足無措地牽着榮兒在後面跟着。她在桂林住得較久，倒並不害怕空　，這是因爲她幾天來很受蘭的感　，已把她母三人當作了自己人看她一急，她也就跟着急起來，可是她一生從無主張，雖然有心想給蘭出一些力，却不知道應該怎樣做，因此只能也像　自己一樣的　做一團。</p>
<p>祝兆年沒有聽清楚好們所說的話。</p>
<p>「別慌！空襲在桂林是不當一會事的。這兒有的是山洞，出大門去幾步路就到了！」他想安慰蘭。</p>
<p>「不是的，是緋緋不見了……！」　帶着酸楚的聲音說，急得臉色慘白。</p>
<p>「什麼？」祝兆年也不由大吃一驚，很快地轉身過去。「她是一個人出去的嗎？」（二）（四）</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>最近有機會讓我重讀了「孫子十三篇」，這位從前被我目為　武的將軍，似乎在我的理解中逐漸現出了他的本來面目—一個審慎的慈善的老人屹立在我底印象中。</p>
<p>開章第一句就說：「兵者，國之大事，死生之地，存亡之道，不可不察也」。這是孫子談兵法的大前提，他正是在諄諄地告誡我們後人，用兵之道並不是私人間出風頭爭地盤的玩意兒，</p>
<p>在謀攻篇孫子特別提出：「上乒伐謀，其次伐交，其次伐兵，下政攻城」。伐兵已是不高明的事，攻城更是下政了。至於勝利的要訣在於上欲下同，迻譯成今語就是政府與人民大衆有同樣的需要。</p>
<p>我們無法以手掌或鐵尺擊平浮　的臉面，巴黎香粉也不必一定用在殯儀館中。</p>
<p>野獸的怒吼，不能治愈人們的頭痛病。</p>
<p>這些都是常識啊！大概是這薄薄的課本印得太少，除了供應小學生讀以外，許多偉大的人都不會讀過。</p>
<p>一個鄉下老頭子，到了上海。我陪他逛馬路，他緊張地望着汽車，好容易才橫行過馬路。他皺了皺了眉頭說：</p>
<p>「怎麽？上海的人這麽多？一堆一堆的，比鄉下牛屎上的蒼蠅這要多」？</p>
<p>鄉下人不懂着伯納式的諷刺；然而這是妙喩，直覺的妙喩，我也不由得好笑了。</p>
<p>又走過一家美術用品公司，玻璃廚窗裏陳列着一具凡列斯（司愛與美的女神）全裸的石膏像；鄉下老頭子愰子幌腦袋：</p>
<p>「怎麽？這個女人褲干都不穿的？虧她還不害臊」。</p>
<p>你如果和他講什麽藝術和曲綫美，似乎都是勞而無功的。</p>
<p>地位不同的人，彼此間都可以發現對方的荒謬。</p>
<p>君不見晋惠帝時，有許多地方鬧飢荒。惠帝自嗚得意地想了一個妙法。</p>
<p>「沒有米吃，吃猪肉好了」。</p>
<p>我想在上海我不到房子住的人，如果怕住在國際飯店不舒服的話，大可到紐約去住幾年。</p>
<p>仁慈的主啊！你要我們吃猪肉嗎？可惜我們胃口不好，你說怎麼辦呢？阿門！</p>
<h3>日飯　品操　美術</h3>
<p>— 徐伸年</p>
<p>在美術節做的好</p>
<p>。筆者並非一至人」所以每睡必夢甚而醒着也在做夢。莊周夢化蝴蝶，飄飄然，不知莊周化為蝴蝶，還是蝴蝶化為莊周？小二仔夢作中央銀行總裁，欣欣然，不知買進美鈔好呢，還是拋出黃金？隔壁黃毛了頭翠珍曾經親口告訴我：屠戶孔老闆身發財發，三輪車進，三輪車出，他的三姨太更福氣，吃飯不管事，打打馬將，倘使上海沒有電燈，大淸早孔老闆宰猪，睡限矇朧，難免誤殺三姨太，因為她和牠，身份相等等；—我想：翠珍在做夢，反正黃毛了頭十八變，她還來得及變咧！小區區善做夢，申明在先；尤其所讀的書往往影響到夢境，譬如說：我白天讀「水滸」，晚上便夢打老虎（是活的老虎）；白天讀某大夫著：「蒼蠅是人類的大敵」，夢裏就大拍而特拍蒼蠅；晚間閱覽「聊齋誌異」，夢中竟和黑白無常拂手同遊！</p>
<p>此時，此刻，此地，我却做了一個頗爲風雅的夢，不可不記。</p>
<p>在夢裏，我瀏覽日郝，偶而發現巨幅廣告：「藝術界茶話會」，這是大標題；小標題有兩行：「不論派別，一視同仁」，「自由參加，母需請帖一。這實在是大能誘惑人了！我信步走去，——還在夢裏，—彷彿到了虹口那隻角裏。我一隻脚正跨進會塲，司儀恰巧喊：」藝術部長訓詞！「我心內想：藝術而有部，中國大大進步了！那位部長的面貌，很熟悉，一時卻說不出誰來。他所致的「訓詞」，非常謙芥，甚至他說：他是來受訓的，而非致訓。跟着便是藝術家代表致答詞。那篇答詞，道道地地出人意表，—至少出乎「我的」意表。致答詞的人先感謝政府對於文藝界的愛護：不但使他們衣食無慮，而且在精神上予以莫大的安慰，如提高赴會地位等等。繼而他代表全體出席者一致請求政府收回津貼政策，因為居此太平盛世，—我繼續談夢，—不需要物質上的津貼。這個請求的提出，博得全塲熱烈的鼓掌。藝術部長含笑起立，長長地回答一番，也博得春雷般的常聲。他的答詞的答詞，歸約起來，約有三點：（一）以前大家誤會美術是奢侈品，現今明白它是精神上的鍵他命；（二）國家對於一切十民都有保護之責，何况文藝家是優秀的子民？（三）文藝家肯努力工作，為國家爭光榮，政府十分感激，所有津貼，微乎其徵，眞所謂：「岡報於萬一」，萬萬不可再提，提起了反而感覺慚愧！接着還有若干人講活，都很謙遜。</p>
<p>最後是餘興。</p>
<p>在諸般餘興節目裏，某某兩大師扮的一遊龍戲鳳」最為精彩。甲大師扮了「龍」，乙大師扮了「鳳」。乙大師有李林甫之肥，却扮了這位女招待的先縣李鳳姐，演來扭扭揑揑，實在笑死人！甲大師裝的皇帝，愁眉苦臉，有些酸溜溜—然而最滑稽的，這兩位大師原是死寃家，曾經對驚，曾經大打出手；今天在戲合上，他們却握手言歡，互相調「戲」起來了！</p>
<p>我正看得高興，一陣風吹動了，我的眉睫，把我驚醒了：原來在十萬八千里之外，有人試放原子彈。</p>
<p>我期待着道這個好夢的實現；—人生最重大的使命便是「期待」（三六，三，十九）。</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] The candidate for Vice-Chairman of the National Government has not yet been determined. It is reported that he will be nominated by Chairman Chiang.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China was unanimously adopted at the tenth session on the afternoon of the 24th. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>This plenary session of our Party is the first gathering after the victorious return to the capital. The time since the last plenary session is exactly one year. During this year, the greatest achievement in Chinese politics has been the convocation of the National Assembly and the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Father of the Nation's advocacy of revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China, and the consistent efforts of our Party since the success of the Northern Expedition, have finally been realized after countless twists and turns. This meeting is held three months after the promulgation of the Constitution. On the one hand, we are pleased that the implementation of constitutional government is expected and that the long-cherished wish of national construction has been fulfilled. At the same time, we examine the current situation of our country. The devastation of the post-war period has not been alleviated, the progress of reconstruction is obstructed, peaceful unification has been undermined, the fruits of victory cannot be promoted, the people's livelihood is difficult, society is unstable, the economy is exhausted, and people's hearts are scattered. We are deeply saddened by the difficulties of the nation's destiny and feel the great responsibility of the revolution even more. We are guided by the Father of the Nation's principles for our struggle: to save the country, save the people, and save the world with great benevolence; to distinguish right from wrong, separate benefits from harms, recognize the times, and know ourselves and others with great wisdom; to have doctrines, purposes, and knowledge with great courage. Therefore, "the world is for all" is the breadth of mind of our Party, serving the people is the duty of our Party, keeping pace with the times is the characteristic of our Party, and persevering in righteousness is the fundamental reason why our Party has overcome difficulties and fulfilled its responsibilities. We have long prepared to return power to the people during the intense period of the War of Resistance. In the past year, in order to enable patriotic and aspiring people to jointly shoulder the responsibility of promoting constitutional government, we have repeatedly expressed our willingness to work with the wise men of the country to overcome difficulties. Now, the agreement to expand the foundation of the government is being implemented. The day when the reorganization of the National Government is completed will be the time when the period of political tutelage begins to end. From then on, the position of our Party and its relationship with the government will be different from the past. However, our Party's sincerity in saving the country and the people, implementing doctrines, and defending the Republic of China should be actively inherited, and we will never shirk it in the slightest. At this meeting, we have made detailed plans on how to revitalize our Party and enrich our Party so that it can adapt to the responsibilities of the new era. We are willing to list the important tasks that should be strived for in the future based on the results of reviewing the domestic and international situations and in response to the major and urgent needs of the current country and nation, and briefly state them to the people of the country.</p>
<p>Complete Constitutional Preparations and Establish National Construction Framework</p>
<p>First, complete the preparations for constitutional government and establish the framework for national construction. The consistent goal of our Party's 50 years of struggle is to remove obstacles to democracy and create a Republic of China that implements the Three Principles of the People. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, for 20 years, the work of national construction has been repeatedly hindered. However, after eight years of the sacred War of Resistance, the Father of the Nation's Three Principles of the People were finally accepted by the whole country as the highest guiding principle for establishing the country, with the goal of building a country of the people, by the people, and for the people. Now that the period for implementing the Constitution as decided by the National Assembly is only nine months away, all preparatory procedures need to be completed with sincerity and trust with all parties and social elites. At this time when the implementation is approaching, the formulation of constitutional laws and regulations, the protection of the people's freedom and rights, the review of existing laws and regulations, the establishment of central and local systems, and the smooth promotion of elections at all levels are all fundamental to establishing the framework of constitutional government. This meeting has made special resolutions on the preparations for the implementation of constitutional government, learning from the past mistakes in the early years of the Republic of China, deeply considering the importance of long-term peace and stability of the country, and believing that the promotion of local autonomy at the grassroots level, the cultivation of the concept of national responsibility among all voters, and the confirmation of the truth that local development and national unity complement each other are especially important considerations for the government after the reorganization. Our Party comrades must, on the one hand, cooperate sincerely with all political parties and support each other, and at the same time, go deep into the people and take on the responsibility of publicizing constitutional government and awakening the people, so that all our compatriots can truly exercise their civil rights and lay a good foundation for the beginning of constitutional government.</p>
<p>Eliminate Obstacles to Unification and Consolidate National Foundation</p>
<p>Second, eliminate obstacles to unification and consolidate the national foundation. The biggest obstacles to national unification, political democracy, and economic construction after the victory of the War of Resistance are the Communist Party's armed disturbances. The National Government's policy of political settlement is based on the spirit of great benevolence and great courage of the Father of the Nation, hoping to move them with consistent sincerity and achieve the goal of peaceful unification, and to alleviate the suffering of the people after the war. In the past year, the government issued orders to stop conflicts three times, and continued to conduct military mediation and negotiations. However, the Communist Party, believing in force and abandoning good faith, carried out a total mobilization in its occupied areas during the government's repeated concessions. Finally, it rejected the government's order to cease fire on the spot, refused to participate in the National Assembly, demanded the cancellation of the Constitution passed by the National Assembly, and launched a full-scale military offensive while the National Army was complying with the ceasefire order, making it impossible to realize the government's policy of political settlement. Wherever the Communist Party's armed forces invaded, the people were either forced to flee or were brutally robbed and killed. The suffering was indescribable, and national unification and social order were undermined. Economic construction and reconstruction were also hindered by its complete destruction of transportation. On the day this meeting was held, the Communist Party's army was launching a full-scale rebellion. We deeply believe that if the country cannot be unified, all kinds of political and economic construction cannot proceed, and the independence and freedom of the country and nation will lose their guarantee. In order to safeguard the survival of the country and nation and to save the people in deep water, this meeting believes that the National Government must take firm and rapid measures to curb the military rebellion of armed violent groups. In the future, after the government is reorganized, our Party will still uphold its consistent revolutionary spirit and jointly assist the government with all parties to eliminate this greatest obstacle to national unification, political democracy, and economic construction. We believe that the policy of peaceful unification should be supported, and the national foundation and people's safety must have strong guarantees. The soldiers who have been fighting for a long time have sacrificed and struggled to save the country and the people. Their hard work is admired by us, and their purpose is only to promote the Communist Party's awakening. Only if the Communist Party is aware that the motherland cannot be betrayed, the people cannot be deceived, and force cannot be relied on forever, and sincerely repents, abandons the illusion of force, and stops destructive work, and transforms from an illegal armed group into a legal ordinary political party and engages in legal political activities, then we firmly believe that the day when the Communist Party expresses with facts that the country's unification, democracy, and construction are effectively guaranteed will be the time when the people of the whole country and the Communist Party can coexist peacefully.</p>
<p>Implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and Stabilize Economic Order</p>
<p>Third, implement the Principle of People's Livelihood and stabilize economic order. Today, another serious obstacle to the country's survival and the people's livelihood is the economic imbalance. Our country was originally an agricultural country that was self-sufficient in production. In the past century, it has been reduced to an economic semi-colony. The National Government established its capital in Nanjing and was determined to build, but within three years, natural disasters and man-made disasters came together. After the September 18th Incident, the Communist Army's violent occupation and Japan's oppression and aggression echoed each other. The government did not have time to breathe and could not devote its full strength to economic construction. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the manpower and resources of the front and rear were exhausted and used for the war of defending the country. After eight years of sacrifice, the only economic foundation was destroyed. The financial and economic difficulties and the people's livelihood difficulties after the war are inevitable facts. After the victory, our country's economic construction failed to quickly obtain full cooperation from international capital and technology, and the implementation of economic policies inevitably sacrificed economic measures to meet financial needs, and financial policies could only take into account current revenues. As it has evolved to this day, prices fluctuate, production stagnates, economic order loses its normality, the number of unemployed people is increasing, and the living conditions of those who are employed are inadequate. This meeting believes that the only way to remedy this is to implement the economic policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood. The meaning of the Principle of People's Livelihood created by the Father of the Nation is to equalize land ownership and control capital, and to formulate strategies for industrial construction, develop national capital, and encourage the people of the whole country to work hard to rebuild production. The goal of the Principle of People's Livelihood is to improve the living standards of the majority of the people and enable the people of the whole country to enjoy a sufficient life. Therefore, all government economic policies must be aimed at the majority of the people, and financial policies and systems must be fundamentally coordinated with this principle, with finance coordinated with the economy, and the economy focusing on production.</p>
<p>More than 80% of our country's total population are farmers. According to the economic policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood, we must address the actual needs of farmers' lives, and we must also base on the economic strength that farmers can produce, and help them to fully develop. In the future, we should especially follow the policy of balanced development of agriculture and industry that has been decided in the past, so that economic recovery and construction will not be concentrated in cities, but will be popularized in rural areas, and the construction of industry should be based on agriculture. Only by concentrating the national manpower, material resources, and financial resources on agricultural and industrial production, and coordinating the use of financial, fiscal, and production policies, and effectively promoting land reform and agricultural improvement, can the output of various daily necessities, industrial raw materials, and export materials be increased day by day. Only if industrial production and development, the existing agricultural production, and rural industries advance simultaneously, can our country's unique economic advantages be effectively utilized. This not only establishes a self-sufficient foundation, but also increases purchasing power and promotes foreign trade to reach a normal state. This is further supplemented by rational management of finance, awards for private industrial production, improvement of methods for lending funds, and universal construction of cooperative organizations. At the same time, the whole country sincerely abides by the laws and regulations on emergency economic measures, so that the currency issued by the country will not create rampant hot money, and a small amount of hot money will not cause the bad result of rising prices. It is hoped that the budget can be balanced on schedule and the currency system can be stabilized. This meeting has made specific resolutions on economic reform, and the main point is to change the general concept of the past in order to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood. It is believed that today's economy must first return to normal before we can talk about construction, we must grasp the fundamentals before we can solve the difficulties. The government must establish credit, and all measures related to economic and financial measures should be widely consulted and carefully decided in advance. Once promulgated, they should never be changed halfway, and then we can expect the people to abide by them together. We sincerely hope that the government and the people of the whole country will work together to promote its implementation.</p>
<p>Seek Independence and Equality and Devote to International Peace</p>
<p>Fourth, uphold international justice and dedicate to international peace. Our country's foreign policy has consistently taken seeking national independence and equality and promoting world justice and peace as its highest goals. The Father of the Nation has always instructed this, and the National Government has inherited and implemented it for 20 years, and its main points are nothing more than this. It is true that our country has been established in the universe for 5,000 years, and the reason for its establishment is based on the ancient precepts of "the world is for all" and "befriending the benevolent and being a good neighbor," and the traditional spirit with which we treat ourselves and others is "not regretting the widows and orphans, and not fearing the strong." Only with the virtue of not regretting the widows and orphans can we have the determination to not fear the strong. Benevolence and courage are consistent. In the past, the violent Japanese invaded and aggressed by relying on their strength. In order to protect our survival and uphold justice, we concentrated our strength and fought a hard war of resistance for eight years. When they were defeated and surrendered, we announced the policy of not remembering old grudges, and sent Japanese prisoners and Japanese residents back to their countries safely. This spirit of our country is nurtured by the national virtues of 5,000 years. Our country has never had the ambition to dominate the world, nor will it rely on others and look up to them in order to lose its principles due to the changes in the international situation. What we value is that the integrity of territorial sovereignty must be maintained, the status of international equality must be difficult to protect, and the position of justice and reason must be respected. Based on the experience of revolutionary salvation, our Party firmly believes that an independent, autonomous, strong, and prosperous China is an indispensable condition for ensuring world peace, and without a solid guarantee of world peace, China's construction cannot proceed smoothly to completion. Therefore, our respect for justice is to fulfill our nature, and we regard the establishment of world peace as a matter of our own interests. Today's world situation is still in a state of instability. However, the wisdom that mankind has gained from the painful sacrifices of this great war should be the main force for firmly establishing international peace and security. We sincerely hope that the organization of the United Nations can quickly grow and become stronger, and that all international disputes can be resolved satisfactorily within the framework of the United Nations, based on justice and treaties. As a member of the common war of resistance, our China should consistently strive for mutual trust and mutual assistance among friendly countries. We also hope that friendly countries of the United Nations will deeply understand the great relationship between world security and the fate of mankind in the future, and with their far-sighted vision, put themselves in the other's shoes in everything, cooperate with each other without discrimination, so as to lay the foundation for human peace and create a foundation for eternal peace.

<h3>Legislative Yuan to Hold Regular Meeting Today to Discuss Presidential Election and Recall Law, Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law Drafts Completed</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold its 319th regular meeting of the fourth session at 9:00 AM on the 25th, during which the Presidential, Vice Presidential, and National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law will be discussed.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The draft of the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law has been reviewed by the Legislative Yuan's Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee on the 24th and can now be submitted to the general assembly. The main point of contention during today's discussion is the issue of election supervision. According to the original draft, election supervision offices in various localities would be committees, while a national election headquarters would be established, with the National Government appointing five to seven members. Provincial offices would be headed by the provincial governor, with three to seven members also appointed. There was considerable debate regarding the number of Legislative Yuan seats for each province. It was generally agreed that discrepancies in the years of population statistics could easily lead to abuses. It was finally decided to base the calculations on the Ministry of Interior's statistics from March 1946. Another major issue was the method of nominating candidates. It was reported that the original plan required only the joint nomination of 500 electors, which was generally considered too few. Some advocated requiring at least 10,000 joint nominations. It was resolved that candidates for regional representatives must have 5,000 nominations, professional representatives must have 500 nominations, and women representatives must have 200 nominations. The only unresolved issue is the division of electoral districts. Some favored large electoral districts, while others favored small electoral districts, which will need further study in the future. Other key points of the draft are: (1) Legislative Yuan elections will be conducted by universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot; (2) Nationals who are 20 years of age or older and do not have any of the following conditions are eligible to vote, and those who are 23 years of age or older and do not have any of the following conditions are eligible to be elected: (A) conviction of a crime under the Criminal Code, (B) corruption, (C) legal incompetence, (D) mental illness; (3) Each elector has only one vote.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] According to a Legislative Yuan member from the Democratic Socialist Party on the 24th, the party has only two important opinions on constitutional and legal matters: (1) Regarding election supervisory bodies, the party hopes that committees with participation from all parties can jointly manage them to avoid manipulation; (2) It hopes to implement the latest proportional representation system to protect both electors and candidates. It is reported that the Youth Party's legislators share the same views as the Democratic Socialist Party on the issue of election supervision.</p>

<p>Enrich Educational Content, Cultivate the Vitality of Nation-Building</p>
<p>Fifth, Enrich Educational Content and Cultivate the Vitality of Nation-Building. During the review of domestic politics, socio-economics and other matters, this meeting deeply felt that the greatest regret and deficiency in the nation-building work of China was the incomplete educational facilities and the increasingly empty educational atmosphere. During our eight years of war of resistance, although the number of schools and students increased, the sacrifices and damage to education were also the greatest. Such as the simplicity of equipment, the lack of funding, the poor lives of education personnel, the wandering of students, and the lack of conditions for clothing, food and hygiene. This tangible loss is enough to affect the physical and mental health of the next generation of the nation, and what is even more heartbreaking is the intangible loss in spirit. Since the transition from the War of Resistance to the later period, due to the changes in the social economy, the disparity between the rich and the poor, the suffering of practical life, and the loss of moral standards, the general social customs have been decadent, and only profit is respected. Integrity is regarded as pedantic, and self-love is regarded as backward. Even our noble and clean institutions of learning cannot withstand the invasion of realism, or even be infected by speculation. The starting point is subtle, and the harm is extremely fierce. Dedicated educators feel the pain of being unable to clap with one hand, and students with unsettled blood energy cannot obtain solid cultivation. The relationship between teachers and students, and even the value of passing strangers, leads to short-sighted people pursuing low-level material desires, and more superior youth often become the objects of political struggles. The times are leaping forward, and the youth on whom the lifeline of our nation-building depends, are exhausting their energy in empty and inappropriate political activities. Nation-building requires a profound academic foundation, but today most young people inevitably neglect the advanced studies of basic academics. Nation-building must have specialized techniques of all kinds, but today most young people still cannot settle down to receive practical skills training. If this continues, young people will not recognize the times, themselves, or the needs of nation-building, and will mislead their extremely precious lives. This meeting, thinking of this, cannot but have unlimited hidden worries for the China of the future, and hopes that those in the education field who are concerned about the future of the country will actively remedy this phenomenon. Our government must also attach importance to education, enrich its funding, enrich its equipment, and enrich the content of its teaching, so that students feel the joy of studying and the preciousness of learning, so as not to be empty and mislead themselves. We also hope that comrades of our party engaged in education and cultural undertakings will pay attention to this phenomenon, and work hard and resolutely to cultivate the vitality of nation-building for the country.</p>
<p>The Future of Nation-Building is Bright, Must Overcome Difficulties</p>
<p>The above points are all related to the vital interests of the current state and people, and are also the key to the success or failure of the nation-building cause. They are specially marked and elaborated. Other matters are detailed in the resolutions. This meeting, which lasted for ten days, deeply felt the bright future of our Chinese nation-building cause and the certainty that the policy of peaceful unity and democratic construction could be achieved. At this time, there are indeed many difficulties and obstacles standing in our way, but as the ancient saying goes, "Sincerity can penetrate even metal and stone." In the past eight years of the War of Resistance, the powerful enemy was finally defeated. In the two years after the war, the worries and hardships have gathered, and they are also being cleared one after another. If we can sincerely unite, be selfless and impartial, not divide into factions, and move forward courageously in the face of adversity, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and break through all obstacles, to fulfill the legacy of the Father of the Nation and complete the entire task of nation-building. Our party dedicates itself to the revolution and only asks for responsibility, not for rights. If it benefits the country, we will risk our lives. From now on, all comrades of our party should strengthen their faith, fulfill their talents, correct their shortcomings, do their best to strengthen themselves, serve the people, and be loyal to the country, so as to follow in the footsteps of our national patriots and not fail the Father of the Nation and the martyrs, nor fail the anti-Japanese martyrs and the fellow countrymen who have been displaced and suffered hardships after the war. Today's staunch struggle is to achieve the brilliant and solemn future. This is our declaration. (The End)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Brightening Domestic Political Situation</h3>
<p>The Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang (KMT) has been discussing current political, economic, military, and diplomatic issues for several days. Not only have important resolutions been passed and effective measures adopted, but these measures are also what the people of the country have been longing for day and night. Therefore, Nanjing has been filled with an optimistic and bright atmosphere these past few days, making everyone feel optimistic about the future of the country. However, the implementation of the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session depends on the government in the future. Therefore, the reorganization of the government is still the focus of the people's attention. Yesterday, it was reported that the government had discussed the reorganization of the government with the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and social leaders, and has made significant progress, and an "Joint Governance Program" has been negotiated. Although it has not yet been approved by the parties, the content of this Joint Governance Program has very important implications. According to various newspapers, the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The peaceful construction program will be the guideline for the policies of the reorganized government; (2) The principles of political democratization and nationalization of the military will be earnestly implemented to promote political progress; (3) The issue of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) should be resolved through political means. Negotiations will be held when transportation is restored and the CCP abandons armed force or accepts reorganization; (4) A system of responsible cabinet government will be implemented. When the Legislative Yuan is in session, the administrative authorities must attend to provide explanations; (5) Before the implementation of the constitution, the president of the Executive Yuan will be appointed by the chairman of the National Government, but must be agreed to by all parties participating in the government; (6) Each province's administration adheres to the principle of separation of military and civilian affairs; (7) Laws and regulations established during the period of political tutelage due to special needs and the established organizations must be abolished and dismantled after the government is reorganized; (8) Tax collection agencies should be reorganized and tax collection procedures simplified; (9) The personal freedom and freedom of speech, assembly, and association of the people must be guaranteed and strictly enforced; (10) Foreign policy should be based on equality and goodwill; (11) Foreign debt should be used for productive construction; (12) Representatives from all parties must be included in the provincial, municipal, and county councils and local governments.</p>
<p>These twelve points are not only a common governance program that the people of the country unanimously demand, but also an important charter for the next nine-month transition period. We believe that all parties in the country will gladly approve it. Because the practical and easy-to-implement democratic constitution passed by the National Assembly last year will be implemented on December 25th of this year. However, from today until the date of implementation of constitutional government, there are only nine months left. In such a short period, how can we not accelerate the completion of all the necessary preparations for the implementation of constitutional government? Therefore, from the day the National Assembly closed, we, the common people, have been eagerly hoping for the reorganization of the government to immediately begin preparing for the implementation of constitutional government. At that time, because peace talks could not be restored and the parties hesitated, the reorganization of the government was delayed again and again, until early March of this year when there was a glimmer of hope. The Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party finally joined the four institutions (Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, National Political Council, and the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association), but this move can only be regarded as a prelude to the two parties' participation in the government, and cannot be seen as an expansion of the foundation of the government. The real reorganization of the government still lies in the reorganization of the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan. Therefore, at that time, all parties were still extremely eager for the reorganization of the government, but the parties could not help but hesitate to jointly assume political responsibility, and then successively expressed that the government would be reorganized after the closing of the KMT's Third Plenary Session. Now that the KMT's Third Plenary Session is about to close, the reorganization of the government is indeed imminent.</p>
<p>As for why we ordinary people are so eagerly awaiting the reorganization of the government? Simply put, because the current period is a transition period for the KMT to end political tutelage and implement constitutional government, the main task of preparing for the implementation of constitutional government must still be the responsibility of the KMT. However, the foundation of the government must be expanded to include the leaders of various parties and social leaders, thereby demonstrating the KMT's sincerity and determination to return power to the people. At the same time, after the government is reorganized, a new batch of blood cells will be added, which will definitely play a considerable role in the innovation of politics and the promotion of constitutional government. However, how should the government be reorganized? What kind of government will be formed after the participation of the parties? In advanced democratic countries, there is naturally no problem, but in China, which is about to implement constitutional government, at least technically, some difficulties will inevitably be encountered. The government representatives and the leaders of the parties, despite much travel between Nanjing and Shanghai, have not been able to negotiate a solution, and that is the reason. However, the government's request for various parties to participate in the government and the various parties' request for the government to expand its foundation, although the positions of both sides are different, the goals they hold are the same. In other words, it is hoped that during this transitional period, all the necessary preparations for the implementation of constitutional government will be completed, so that China's politics can embark on the path of true democracy. As long as this goal can be achieved, no matter how the National Government Committee members are distributed? No matter how the various departments under the Executive Yuan are allocated? The government and the parties can have no objections, but how can the parties believe that the reorganized government will be able to complete this task? There must be a common governance program among the parties. The purpose of negotiating a common program this time is also here. With a common program, as long as the reorganized government implements it earnestly, the parties will not have to ask how many members are participating in the government. Therefore, the negotiation of a common program is indeed a preliminary success in the reorganization of the government, and it is worthy of our celebration.</p>
<p>Finally, we must point out that the biggest feature of the Common Program is that it still uses the peaceful nation-building program passed by the Political Consultative Conference as the guiding principle for the reorganized government's policies. The government and various parties' repeated statements to abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference not only dispel malicious criticisms attacking the government for undermining the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, but also prove that only the government and the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party are truly able to abide by the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The editorials of this newspaper for more than a year have all said this when discussing peace talks. To be honest, if Chinese politics does not embark on the path of political democratization and nationalization of the military, and blindly wanders at the crossroads, there will never be a way out. When the Political Consultative Conference concluded successfully, we wrote an article celebrating the future of the country; when the CCP attempted to expand its territory by force and destroy the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, we repeatedly advised the CCP not to be obsessed, otherwise it would not only be self-destructive to the people of the country, but also be enough to plunge the country into a state of eternal doom. Therefore, we still hope that the CCP can have a great epiphany now. Put down your weapons, the government will not be tough on the CCP to the end because of the restoration of Yan'an. As long as the CCP has the sincerity to put down its weapons, the government will be able to sincerely resume peace talks with the CCP and resolve the CCP issue through political means. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has announced at the Third Plenary Session that the KMT is preparing to regard itself as an ordinary political party. Yesterday, at the Central Memorial Week, he said that all KMT members must fully prepare in the next nine months so that they can stand on an equal footing with other political parties and engage in political competition. If the CCP also considers itself an ordinary political party, appeals to the people with its ideology, and relies on public opinion in everything, then it should also put down its weapons and compete for power with other political parties through legitimate and legal procedures. Even if it fails due to competition, it can still maintain its existing status, which is a thousand times better than the CCP's current use of force to seize power, which is spurned by the people of the country! I hope the CCP can wake up and realize, and I hope that the domestic political situation will be brighter and more promising from now on!</p>

<h3>Seeking Compromise on the German Question, Foreign Ministers' Conference Enters New Stage, British and American Foreign Policies Fully Converge</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] London, 24th broadcast: Reviewing the two-week-long four-power debate, it is found that Britain and the United States hold the same foreign policy on the German question. In previous foreign ministers' meetings, the opinions of Britain and the United States on the German satellite country treaty were not the same, but there has never been such a close consensus of opinions as this time. The four powers are adjourned today to allow the special committee to reconcile and compare the various proposals put forward in the past two weeks. The special four-power committee will report on the key points of agreement and conflict tomorrow, so as to determine the steps to be taken in the future.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 24th dispatch] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to resume tomorrow, and the diplomatic struggle over the German question will enter a new stage. Both the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain intend to make the German government most favorable to their own political system, so they are planning strategies separately, and must make the German government's mode the same as their own. The four foreign ministers' representatives are also discussing the German peace treaty, working hard to reduce various political and economic proposals, and reporting the agreed and disagreed points to the foreign ministers. An American official said that this week is a critical period, and the result will show whether this Moscow meeting can be expected to achieve concrete results on the entire issue.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 23rd dispatch] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will take a two-day break today, and the foreign ministers need to sort out the documents, proposals and plans of the two weeks of meetings. US Secretary of State Marshall stayed indoors almost all day today. According to his adjutant, Marshall has no plans to meet with Marshal Stalin. The foreign ministers' meeting has been going on for two weeks, and Marshall and Bevin have not proposed to meet with Stalin, and Stalin has not proposed to meet with Marshall and Bevin. People have begun to express surprise at this.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 23rd dispatch] Although the distance between the opinions of the four powers in the foreign ministers' meeting is far, senior American officials here have expressed "limited" optimism after two weeks of the meeting. They believe that it is too early to predict the outcome of the foreign ministers' meeting at present, but pointed out that the progress of the foreign ministers' meeting is faster than expected. In just two weeks, except for the issue of Germany's future borders, which is the US plan to disarm the German army, which has not yet been mentioned, almost all the items on the agenda have been discussed. The foreign ministers will conduct real negotiations from next week, which may shorten the distance of opinion divergence or find a compromise solution. Only after several days of such negotiations can it be expected whether a basic agreement on the principles of the German peace treaty is possible.</p>
<h3>Many Disputes Still Exist in the Austrian Peace Treaty, the Stalemate is Urgently Seeking to Be Broken, Austrian Representatives Will Attend to State Opinions</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] Moscow, 25th broadcast: At the foreign ministers' meeting today, the issue of Austrian compensation was discussed. The Soviet representative insisted that Yugoslavia should receive US$150 million in compensation, which caused fierce debate. Without any results, it was decided to hand it over to the four foreign ministers for discussion.</p>
<p>[United Press Moscow, 23rd dispatch] The four foreign ministers are currently discussing the Austrian peace treaty, of which there are seventeen key points, and the opinions of all parties have failed to converge. US Secretary of State Marshall recently made a proposal to postpone the discussion of technical programs and first reach a basic agreement, so as to break this stalemate. According to Hua's representative Clark: The four foreign ministers are currently drafting the final report, so as to submit it to the foreign ministers' meeting for discussion on Saturday, and then listen to the opinions of the Austrian representatives. The main point of contention in the current stalemate is the issue of German property that has been moved away from Austria. The Soviet Union believes that it has the right to move it, while Britain and the United States insist that it cannot be moved. Marshall now advocates postponing the discussion of technical issues and first determining the interpretation of German property in Austria. This proposal will now be submitted for discussion at the four-power meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The key points of the disputes listed by Clark are as follows: (1) There are two conflicting opinions in the preamble, namely, A Which other countries can be allowed to participate in signing the contract; B The United States does not regard Austria as an enemy country, so should Austria bear the responsibility for participating in the war. (2) There are six conflicting opinions on political clauses, namely, whether the Allied powers and Austria should bear the obligation to maintain Austria's independence, the issue of prohibition of annexation, whether Austria's borders should be based on the borders of 1938, or whether the territorial demands of Yugoslavia should be recognized and modified, and so on. (3) There are five conflicting opinions on military clauses, namely, whether Austria will supply its military needs with its own military equipment, whether it should be prohibited from researching or manufacturing certain military materials, and whether the Allied powers need to send a military delegation to Austria to monitor its implementation of military clauses, and so on. (4) In addition to the issue of German property, what the Allied powers cannot agree to is whether Austria should restore to its original state the property of the United Nations that was robbed by the Axis countries within its territory, and whether it should compensate for the war damage suffered by the property of the United Nations at the price, and so on.</p>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch] London, 24th broadcast: The Moscow Pravda reported today: The Soviet Union has acquired German assets as Austrian compensation, the total amount of which does not exceed 10% of Austria's total industrial productivity. In various industries, the part occupied by the Soviet Union is only 2.3%. The newspaper condemned Britain and the United States for coveting Austria's industry and attempting to undermine the Potsdam Agreement on Austrian compensation.</p>
<h3>Vastly Different Opinions Between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the Issue of Universal Disarmament</h3>
<p>[United Press Success Lake, 23rd dispatch] The United Nations Disarmament Commission is scheduled to meet on the afternoon of the 24th. It is said that the Soviet Union has drafted a detailed plan for world disarmament, but this statement cannot be confirmed so far. British and American representatives hope that Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko can clearly put forward some concrete suggestions. British representative Sir Jaddagan and US representative Johnson have been ordered to oppose any suggestion of the Soviet Union to start disarmament in the near future, because Britain and the United States believe that disarmament is absolutely impossible before establishing a solid guarantee and the United Nations establishes a "peacekeeping mechanism". And before the establishment of international control of atomic energy, disarmament is just hope. Gromyko has repeatedly ridiculed the views of Britain and the United States, and pointed out that this is an imperialist argument. British and American representatives believe that the only reasons why the Soviet Union is so keen on rapid disarmament are (1) to stir up the issue of disarmament to obstruct the progress of national control of atomic energy, because the Soviet Union is the only major country that opposes the US atomic energy control and investigation plan; (2) to regard it as a propaganda effect, using the issue of disarmament to take the initiative in the United Nations organization and force Britain and the United States to follow suit. In order to avoid the Disarmament Commission from being involved in the issue of atomic energy, the US representative insisted on defining a clear boundary between the two committees, and all atomic weapons and weapons of mass destruction should be discussed by the Atomic Energy Commission. It is also learned that the Atomic Energy Commission will start another new stage of the meeting from the 26th of this month, and the Trusteeship Committee will also start its first meeting on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Hoover Strenuously Advocates, Rejuvenating German Industry</h3>
<p>Anti-Soviet Law Undermines Potsdam Agreement</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 24th dispatch] Former US President Hoover submitted the third German-Austrian economic survey report to President Truman, suggesting to restore German industrial production and reduce its military potential. He also pointed out that the production policies implemented by the Soviet Union and France in Germany are undermining the Potsdam Agreement, and the relief plan implemented by Britain and the United States in Germany is paying compensation to the Soviet Union and France on behalf of Germany, resulting in a sacrifice of 70 million US dollars per year for British and American taxpayers.</p>
<h3>Yalta Secret Agreement Stipulates, German Prisoner Labor as Compensation</h3>
<p>[United Press London, 24th dispatch] Foreign Minister McNair confirmed in the House of Commons today that the three powers stipulated in the Yalta Secret Agreement that the labor of German prisoners of war should be used as part of the compensation.</p>
<h3>US Senator Coleman Advocates, Taking Economic Retaliation Against the Soviet Union, and Emphasizes the US Peace Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 23rd dispatch] Congressman Coleman, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, proposed today that the United States "should expose the Soviet Union's paper tiger and deal with it with the only means it understands, namely economic retaliation." Coleman also said that he will submit a bill tomorrow to advocate a stronger attitude towards all communist-controlled governments, and the United States shall not lend to them or provide other assistance. The content of this resolution is as follows: (1) The arrears shall not be cancelled before the conditions stipulated in the Lend-Lease Act are fulfilled; (2) The United States shall terminate all forms of assistance to any government that fails to fulfill the United Nations Charter; (3) The United States shall not grant new loans to such governments, and those that have been negotiated shall be suspended pending their fulfillment of political agreements; (4) Prevent such countries from obtaining US industrial secrets and other confidential national defense information; (5) The United States and other countries should take completely mutual measures for factory practice or visits, and should not be merely a unilateral act; (6) The United States should prevent excessive exaction of German compensation, so that it can be self-sufficient, and terminate the relief expenses of the Allied powers; (7) Notify the whole country and declare that the purpose of the US policy is to seek and maintain a just and lasting peace in the free world. Coleman admitted that this bill was issued against the Soviet Union, but also said that some governments have failed to fulfill political agreements and hold free elections in liberated areas.</p>
<h3>Before the Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill is Passed, the United States Plans to Allocate 100 Million Yuan First, to be Used as the Initial Expenses of the Entire Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington, 24th dispatch] President Truman's proposal to aid Greece and Turkey to prevent communism is currently being discussed in Congress. It will not become law until mid-April, but the deadline for British troops to withdraw from Greece on March 31 is approaching. Therefore, some people in Washington are moving today to authorize President Truman to borrow 100 million US dollars from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation first, so as to cope with the situation after the withdrawal of British troops from Greece. President Truman's plan requires a total of 400 million US dollars to aid the Greek and Turkish governments and provide civil and military guidance. The temporary allocation of 100 million US dollars is roughly to fill the initial expenses of this plan to fill the gap when the United States has not yet stepped in after the British side withdraws from the Middle East. Assistant Secretary of State Clayton was summoned to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today to review the funds in President Truman's plan in detail. At the same time, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee has also begun to study this plan, summoning Acting Secretary of State Acheson to attend the meeting and present his views. Democratic Senator Lucas said: If the two parties can overcome this test of cooperation, it is expected that President Truman will invite the Republican Party to discuss other issues of foreign policy. According to observers, the State Department's announcement of the Soviet Union's secret documents on the "nerve war" against Turkey has greatly stimulated members of Congress and will intensify efforts to complete the legislative procedures for President Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey bill as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Acheson Continues to Explain the US Policy of Aiding Greece and Turkey</h3>
<p>The Purpose is to Maintain Democratic Politics</p>
<p>[United Press Washington, 23rd dispatch] US Acting Secretary of State Acheson declared to the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday: A proposal for the United States to lend 400 million US dollars to Greece and Turkey is aimed at safeguarding the basic principles of the United Nations and assisting the people of each country to determine their own political system, but the US government does not want them to adopt the US government. When asked whether this proposal is a plan for the "equilibrium of power" policy, Acheson replied: "Greece is not only one of the ancient countries in the world, but democratic politics also originated in Greece. Now the country is in a difficult state of economy and finance. Our aid to the country is to give it an opportunity to gain a foothold and protect its democratic politics." When asked whether the US plan is aimed at communism or the Soviet Union, Acheson replied: Except for the division of labor, it is not a blow to anyone. We do not want to attack any country, nation or government. This move is not a crusade with any political significance. The United States has no intention of maintaining the status quo in these countries. When asked what the consequences would be if President Truman's plan was not approved, Acheson replied: I think the result will inevitably make the countries in the Near East have a strong feeling that the United States does not care about fulfilling its guarantee to maintain free nations and free institutions.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 23rd] The Pan-Asian Conference opened here today. Jawaharlal Nehru, leader of the Indian National Congress and Deputy Prime Minister, delivered the opening address, emphasizing the peaceful and friendly objectives of the conference, and that it was not directed against Europe or America. He stated, "We wish to contribute to world peace. The Pan-Asian Conference has no political objectives; it seeks only to promote friendship among Asian nations.

<h3>Former Kwantung Army Staff Officer Denies Supporting Puyi</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th (Special Dispatch)] Katakura, a former staff officer of the Kwantung Army, testified as a defense witness for Japanese war criminals at the Far East International Military Tribunal this morning. He denied that the Kwantung Army had worked to establish the puppet state of Manchukuo. He insisted that Puyi fled to the Northeast of his own volition and that the Kwantung Army did not order him to go. He claimed that Kenji Doihara notified the Kwantung Army on November 9, 1932, that Puyi wished to go to the Northeast as soon as possible, which should be supported by all 30 million people of the Northeast and the Japanese. According to another telegram from Doihara, Puyi planned to go to the Northeast before the Liaodong Bay froze in winter. Katakura strenuously defended Jiro Minami, who was the Minister of the Army at the time, stating that the Ministry of the Army had strictly ordered the Kwantung Army not to interfere in the movement to restore the monarchy in the Northeast. Doihara was sent to Tianjin by Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army Honjo Shigeru in November of the following year. His special mission was to gather intelligence in the Pinghan area, explore Puyi's intentions, and study the policies to be adopted if Zhang Xueliang took action south of the Great Wall. Doihara was specifically ordered not to make any promises to Puyi.</p>

<h3>Following Truman's Order to Purge Official Corruption, Congress Begins Action, Plans to Withhold Funding to Force Dismissal of Suspicious Elements</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Following President Truman's order to purge official corruption yesterday afternoon, Congress today proposed withholding funding to force the dismissal of officials with suspicious words and deeds who are disloyal to their duties. The House Appropriations Committee has refused to allocate funds for the Director of the Mediation Service, Warren, hoping that the House will approve it. The committee believes that Warren had joined "a front leaning towards the Communist Party," but Warren stated that he was unaware of the nature of this organization and has withdrawn from it. Some congressmen are now also discussing refusing to allocate funds to Lilienthal, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. President Truman's appointment of Lilienthal as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission had previously drawn criticism.</p>
<h3>US Publishes Report on Greece and Turkey, Lists Reasons for US Support of the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The State Department has just released a report on Greece and Turkey, in which it accuses the Soviet Union of waging a war of nerves against the two countries and attempting to obtain special privileges to control and defend the Turkish Straits. Regarding Greece, the report states that the presence of British troops in Greece is believed to be the main factor preventing the governments of Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria from taking aggressive action. Furthermore, the United States believes that if Britain and Greece can reach an agreement to annex Cyprus to Greece, the United States is willing to support it. The United States supports Greece maintaining its 1939 borders but opposes Greece's demand to acquire the Northern Epirus province of Albania. However, the United States does not object if Greece presents this demand to the Council of Foreign Ministers. The United States also supports the transfer of the Dodecanese Islands to Greece but opposes changing the Greek-Bulgarian border. These issues will be decided after the treaties with the Axis satellite states come into effect.</p>
<p>The report further reveals that the United States has begun negotiations with Greece on a treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation and has informed Britain and Greece that it opposes the British proposal to establish a Greek commercial corporation. The United States believes that the military occupation of Greece implemented under the Anglo-American Agreement of 1942 has a stabilizing effect on Greece. The United States has recently suggested to the Greek government that it broaden its government base to include all loyal Greek parties, whether or not they participate in the current parliament, but that extreme leftists who attempt to undermine Greek independence and right-wing reactionaries who refuse to cooperate with truly free elements should be excluded from the government.</p>
<p>The report further reveals that the number of British troops stationed in Greece has been greatly reduced in recent months and can no longer be regarded as an operational force. The number of British troops in Greece will soon be reduced to 6,000, so the British presence in Greece has only a political and psychological effect and may have some effect in preventing aggression against Greece by the three countries of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania. These three countries have an aversion to Greece and harbor territorial ambitions. Due to the weakness of the Greek military, Greece's three northern neighbors, acting alone or independently, could easily seize part of Greek territory if there were no international considerations. If the troops of the three countries invaded Greece and clashed with British troops, the political situation would inevitably become more serious. The report continues: The United States believes that the Greek National Liberation Front is not sufficient to represent democratic Greece and that the Greek Communist Party and its affiliated organizations are a serious threat to the Greek state. The 13,000-strong armed forces controlled by the Communist Party are roughly equal in strength to the poorly trained and poorly treated Greek government forces.</p>
<p>The report concludes by stating that the United States is deeply concerned about the security issues arising from the dilemma between Greece and its northern neighbors. The United States believes that this security issue is fundamentally related to the security of the United States itself. (Note: Although the public statements of President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and Undersecretary of State Acheson did not explicitly mention the Soviet Union, the official documents received by the US Congress directly name the Soviet Union, accusing it of waging a war of nerves against Greece, of being hostile to the current Greek government, and of obstructing the UN agency's investigation team on the Greek situation.)</p>
<p>Regarding Turkey, the report states that Turkey feels that it has fallen into an extremely difficult position with regard to the Soviet Union, and the tension between the two countries has not eased. The Soviet Union's continued attempts to enjoy special privileges to control and defend the Turkish Straits have stalled negotiations to revise the Montreux Convention. The Soviet Union has ambitions for certain strategic locations in northeastern Turkey. Turkey deeply hopes to restore the country to political normalcy, begin the demobilization of its troops, and revive its national economy, but its entire people are united in resisting foreign aggression and believe that the integrity of the Middle East and the independence of the nation are necessary for world peace. US financial loans to Turkey are sufficient to ensure its sovereignty or territorial integrity from threats.</p>
<p>The report states, regarding the Straits issue: Turkey is firmly opposed to any treaty revisions that would infringe upon Turkish sovereignty over the Straits, but the Soviet Union seems determined to participate in the control and defense of the region. Regarding the Soviet Union's demands for the Kars region and the Ardahan province, the United States believes that neither historically nor legally is there sufficient justification for its demands. The Soviet Union's goals are to protect the security of the Caucasus oil fields, gain access to the Persian Gulf, and pressure Turkey to establish a Turkish regime that caters to Soviet desires.</p>
<p>The report further states that the demands of the Georgian Soviet Republic for land in eastern Turkey have no ethnic basis and that Georgia's demands involve the entire relationship between the Soviet Union and the Middle East today.</p>
<p>The economic portion of the report states that Turkey must maintain a large military force, and its military spending exceeds half of the nation's total income, so its economic situation is very difficult. Trade between Turkey and the Soviet Union has almost completely stopped, and the United States has become Turkey's best customer and its main source of supply.</p>

<h3>Central Bank Employees Found to Have Purchased Gold: Assistant Managers, Directors, and Others Receive Penalties of Dismissal and Demotion. All Accounting Records of Tongfengyu Gold Shop Sent to Court. Police Bureau Denies Investigation Team's Request to Access Records</h3>
<p>Regarding the gold rush case, in which employees of the Central Bank were found to have purchased gold, the bank has thoroughly investigated and handled the matter. The names and quantities of gold purchased by all employees have been verified and reported to the bank's governor, who has referred the matter to the personnel department for disciplinary action. It is learned that four individuals, including Wang Songtao, assistant manager of the business bureau, Wang Yuanqing and You Di, deputy directors, and Da Fu, clerk, have been dismissed. In addition, it is rumored that many others have received penalties of demotion and warning.</p>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) The sensational gold rush case, which began with accusations by supervisory committee members You, Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, and Zhan Yunsheng being arrested, has subsided after Lin and Yang were temporarily released to handle the handover of duties, and Zhan was sent to court for detention and interrogation. Recently, the Ministry of Finance suddenly reopened the investigation into this case. He Qi, an advisor from the Ministry of Finance, and Fan Shixing, an auditor from the Auditing Department, were ordered to come to Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday afternoon, they visited Fang Zhichao, director of the administrative division, and Xu Youzuo, chief of the fourth section, at the police bureau, requesting access to all accounting records relating to Zhan Yunsheng's handling of the Central Bank's gold allocation, as investigated by the former Economic Inspection Team's Gold and Currency Group. However, the police bureau believed that since the case files and the suspects had already been sent to the court, the police bureau should be responsible to the court and could not hand over the accounting records to other agencies, so the request was denied. After several hours of negotiations, Advisor He and Director Fang contacted the head of the district court by telephone, and it was finally decided that the police bureau would first transfer the accounting records of Zhan Yunsheng of Tongfengyu Gold Shop to the court in accordance with the procedures. If the Ministry of Finance needed to access the records, they could directly contact the court. All accounting records were personally sent to the district court by Section Chief Xu at 5:30 PM yesterday. The Economic Inspection Team conducted a very detailed investigation into the corruption in the Central Bank's gold allocation, and the impeachment brought forward by the supervisory committee members was largely based on this investigation.</p>
<h3>Speeding Up Screening of Opium Addicts; Expected Completion within Two Months</h3>
<p>The municipal government recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Interior stating that there are still over 4,000 registered opium addicts in Shanghai who have not been screened, and that the crackdown on unregistered opium addicts should be intensified. Based on this, the municipal government immediately ordered the Municipal Police Bureau to comply. The Police Bureau has reported the progress to the municipal government, stating that a total of 6,060 opium addicts have been registered in the city. In accordance with regulations, screening began on July 1, 1946. Due to the limited number of beds in the Shanghai Opium Addiction Screening Center and the limited number of people it can accommodate, the screening has been conducted in batches, with a total of 1,225 people in each of the two batches, totaling 3,605 people. The number of opium addicts who have not been screened is actually only 2,455, and a large number of them have died, moved, or have incorrect addresses, making it impossible to serve summons. Currently, the Bureau of Health has designated 15 municipal public hospitals to assist the Opium Addiction Screening Center in carrying out the screening work. At the same time, the Bureau is supervising the various sub-bureaus under its jurisdiction to investigate and identify unscreened opium addicts and summon them for screening in batches. It is expected that all screening will be completed within two months. As for unregistered opium addicts, the Bureau has been strictly cracking down on them, without the slightest懈怠. It is estimated that 2,264 opium offenders have been arrested as of the end of January this year, and the Bureau will continue to supervise its subordinates to earnestly crack down on them.</p>

<h3>Pig Bristle Industry Gradually Resumes Operations: Wage Adjustment Resolved</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) The pig bristle industry in Shanghai was previously facing difficulties due to the sluggish market, and various foreign firms and companies were laying off employees or shutting down due to lack of profit.

Around the beginning of this month, the market improved, and various firms and factories gradually resumed operations, rescuing the unemployed workers. In order to stabilize their lives, workers demanded that the management adjust wages according to the cost of living index. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the Bureau of Social Affairs convened representatives from major firms in the industry and labor representatives for mediation, and a wage adjustment plan was agreed upon: (1) For bristle sorting from 2 inches to 2.7 inches, the base salary is 23 yuan per dan; for 3 inches and above, the base salary is 20 yuan per dan.

<h3>Coal Supply to Shanghai Decreases, Fuel Management Committee Faces Great Difficulties. 6,000 Tons of Stored Coal to Be Reallocated to Public Servants and Teachers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Xie Baokang, the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee, stated that the committee was instructed by the Executive Yuan to prepare approximately 6,000 tons of coal for the 120,000 public servants and teachers in the city. Therefore, the 6,000 tons of retail coal originally intended for allocation to residents will be reallocated for coal balls to public servants and teachers. Recently, the source of coal has been scarce. The amount of coal transported from North China to Shanghai this month is only 80,000 tons, but the city's average monthly consumption is more than 140,000 tons. This 80,000 tons can only supply the needs of public utilities. Last month, coal for factories was also allocated from the only 50,000 tons of coal in stock to solve the immediate problem. Therefore, it is impossible to supply retail coal on the market. However, we hope that the source of coal will be unimpeded.</p>
<h3>Fake Police Bureau Deputy Director Rao Shu Tried; Eloquent and Energetic, Claims He Only Acted in a Play</h3>
<p>(Reported by this newspaper) The case of Rao Shu, suspected of being a traitor, was heard at the High Court yesterday afternoon. Rao Shu, also known as Rao Yunbo, is from Wuhu, Anhui, and is 55 years old. He served as the section chief of the Second Division of the Puppet Special Service Headquarters, responsible for collecting international intelligence. He was later transferred to serve as the Deputy Director of the Wuhan District of the Puppet Special Service Headquarters. He then served as the Inspector-General under Shigeru Gojima, the Chief of the Special Higher Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, and later as the Deputy Director of the Puppet Fuzhou Road Police Bureau. After the victory, he was arrested by the Military Intelligence Bureau and sent to the court for interrogation. Rao was eloquent and energetic when answering questions in court yesterday. He stated: I originally served in the Central Bureau of Statistics and was sent to work in Shanghai during the War of Resistance. In the autumn of 1939, I was captured by Li Shiqun's subordinates at the Great World and detained at 76 Jessefield Road. I was detained for two and a half months. During my detention, I discussed with two friends that we would act in a play. Although we could not eliminate the special agents of the "Peace Movement," we could at least save a few people. That's how I joined the puppet organization. At first, I served as the section chief of the Second Division of the Puppet Special Service Headquarters, translating English newspapers. Later, I was transferred to serve as the Deputy Director of the Wuhan District. In Hankou, I met Gojima Shigeru, the Chief of the Special Higher Police of the Japanese Military Police, and I had a very good relationship with Gojima. Whenever comrades working for our side were arrested by the Japanese Military Police, I would always use Gojima's connections to try to bail them out. Later, Gojima Shigeru was transferred to serve as the Chief of the Special Higher Police of the Puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, and I also came to Shanghai to work with him. I saved so many people that I can't remember their names. I was just goofing around while working in the puppet organization. If the court investigates and finds that I ever arrested anyone, I will commit suicide. Please investigate my crimes. I don't want to be let off easily, but I can't be wronged either. Subsequently, Lan Chengzai, a staff member of the Military Intelligence Bureau, testified in court that he was arrested by the enemy Military Police in Shanghai in 1942 and sent to Nanjing. He was released on bail by Rao Shu, thus avoiding disaster. At this point, the court adjourned the hearing, stating that further investigation was needed.</p>
<h3>Hsu Wei-chen's Sentence Reduced to Four Years; Hsieh Hsiao-chu Denied Bail</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Hsu Wei-chen, the former president of the puppet Shanghai High Court, was originally sentenced to ten years' imprisonment by the High Court. The defendant appealed and applied for a retrial by the Supreme Court. After review, the Supreme Court held that although the defendant had participated in the puppet organization and taken over the Shanghai court, which constituted damage to the judicial system, the defendant claimed that he had been forced to take the puppet position due to pressure from the enemy and puppets, and the duration of his service was very short, having resigned before June of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942). Taking the circumstances into consideration, the original judgment was revoked, and the sentence was reduced to four years' imprisonment. The judgment has already been delivered to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Hsieh Hsiao-chu, chairman of the puppet Chemical Raw Materials Trade Association, has been sentenced to two years and six months' imprisonment. He recently requested bail for medical treatment due to illness, but the High Court rejected his application.</p>
<h3>Yang Chih-tang and Cheng Huai Each Sentenced to Two and a Half Years</h3>

The trial of the case concluded yesterday in the High Court, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the morning of the 31st.</p>
<p>Tao Ping-ho and Lu Kuei-tao, accused of serving as head and deputy head of the puppet "Child's Companion Youth Corps" in Pudong, respectively, argued during the hearing at the old Yumi Court yesterday afternoon that their defense lawyer, Bao [blank space], presented evidence of the defendants' work in the guerrilla forces, and the defendants denied ever holding puppet positions. As further investigation is required, the hearing was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Pier Quarantine for Ships Sailing to the Yangtze River and Other Ports</h3>

<h3>Merchants and Residents of Sevenpin and Tsaohoking Petition for Highway Operating Rights</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Approximately 500 merchants, residents, and stores in Sevenpin and Tsaohoking are jointly petitioning the Municipal Council regarding the dispute over the operating rights of the Tsaopin Highway. The petition states: "The entire route of the Tsaopin Highway and the land taxes over the years have been paid by the residents. A Transportation Committee has been organized by the chiefs of the villages along the road, representatives of the district, councilors, and impartial gentry. However, there has been no formal passenger transportation service. When the road was first built, the Shanghai-Minhang Transportation Company intended to invest, but for ten years, there has been no communication. Now that the Tsaopin Road Transportation Committee has been organized and is beginning to operate vehicles, the Shanghai-Minhang route's vehicles are rashly operating on this road, obstructing the local public-operated vehicles. They want to take the operating rights of the highway based on an undetermined road from ten years ago, disregarding local public opinion and undermining public welfare. Therefore, we request that the authorities uphold local public interest, not advocate for private enterprises, and make a reasonable resolution with the Shanghai-Minhang Company. At the same time, we request the Public Utilities Bureau to issue a business license to the Tsaopin Highway Transportation Committee, to comply with public opinion and benefit transportation."</p>

According to Che Chi-kuei's confession, on December 9th of last year, Chang Kuo-hsien, a representative of the Kuo Chi Righteous School, wanted to build a schoolhouse and planned to demolish a damaged air raid shelter built by the enemy and puppets in the Fudan University sports field. It was estimated that over 100,000 bricks could be obtained, and they planned to sell them to fund the schoolhouse construction, using the rubble, all the iron bars, and broken cement to offset labor costs, and a contract was signed. The demolition has now been completed, and a total of 160,000 bricks have been obtained. The precinct sent officers to investigate and summoned the school's representative, Chang Kuo-hsien, for questioning. According to Chang, he had initiated the establishment of the Righteous School last year, and because there were many students and the schoolhouse was insufficient, he planned to sell the bricks from the air raid shelter to fund the construction of the schoolhouse. According to the investigating police officer, the Kuo Chi Righteous School has not yet been registered and approved by the Education Bureau. Zhang Kuo-hsien and Che Chi-kuei are suspected of colluding to steal and sell enemy property. After reporting the situation to the General Bureau, they were handed over to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution yesterday on charges of damage.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Prison Factory: Prisoners Work Hard to Produce; A Five-Story Gray Building with Various Manufacturing Workshops</h3>
<p>[Our Report by Our Writer] In the old days, prisons caused great physical and mental suffering to prisoners. After leaving prison, good people turned bad, and bad people turned worse, and society never had peace. Modern prisons have completely adopted progressive measures, not only passively punishing, but also actively reforming, turning bad people into good people, and useless people into useful people. Not only are food and housing hygienic and comfortable, but they are also trained in work skills, so that each person has a skill that will enable them to become a productive member of society after leaving prison, rather than a parasite on society. After visiting the Shanghai Prison Factory, I was even more amazed by the progress and rationality of modern prisons.</p>
<p>The factory is located behind the prison office, in a five-story gray building. Upon entering, there are signs that read "Silence", "Maintain Order", and "Keep to the Right". The factory starts work at 6:30 a.m. and ends at 5:15 p.m. Meal times: 7:50 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Workers wear gray prison uniforms and are numbered. There is no fixed salary, and payment is based on work performance. On the north side of the first floor is the iron factory, with 15 workers, who use black iron and white iron to make iron pipes, iron buckets, and other items. On the south side is the box-pasting factory, with 205 workers, who paste matchboxes for China, Liming, Great China, and First-Class match factories. Each person can paste 400 to 500 pairs of boxes per day. The highest daily production can reach 70,000 boxes. On the north side of the second floor is the factory office, and on the south side is the wood lacquering factory, with 40 workers, who make tables, chairs, boxes, and sofas. After completion, they are painted by lacquerers. Most of the orders come from furniture stores. On the north side of the third floor is the sandblasting factory, with six electrically powered machines. On the south side is the towel factory, with 82 hand-cranked wooden machines. Unfortunately, both places have been shut down due to the fact that cotton yarn raw materials have not yet been allocated. On the north side of the fourth floor is the printing factory, with 84 workers and 20 large and small machines. They mostly print stationery for the Ministry of Judicial Administration, which is then bundled into packages of 2,500 sheets and sent to Nanking. On the south side is the typesetting factory, with 39 workers, who are divided into typesetting, inserting characters, distributing characters, proofreading, lead plates, collating, type casting, and lead line departments. On the north side of the fifth floor is the binding factory, with 63 workers, who make envelopes, bind books, paste matchboxes, and print red and blue lines in forms. Among them is a kind of hard-covered, finely bound accounting book, which is entirely made by the factory workers. On the south side is the sewing factory, with 70 workers and 19 sewing machines, who make Chinese clothing, Western clothing, military uniforms, gloves, cloth shoes, and leather shoes.</p>
<p>After a hurried tour, there are managers in each room, wearing black uniforms, who explain the details to the visitors. The prisoners are all immersed in their work, happy, quiet, and focused. If I forgot that this was the Shanghai Prison, I would never imagine that they were people who had lost their freedom. "Clothing, food, housing, and work", the four major needs of life, are all solved here, although there is one drawback – no freedom.</p>
<p>Everything else is quiet and focused, just no freedom.</p>

<h3>Zhabei Silk Factory No. 1 and No. 2: No Need for Renovation to Resume Operations</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has forwarded a case to the China Silk Company that was previously submitted by the Shanghai Sixth District Silk Industry Association to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting the restoration of Zhabei Silk Factory No. 1 and No. 2 to alleviate unemployment. According to the company's report, the machinery of the two factories is only capable of producing [blank space] short and mixed raw silk, which is used exclusively for wool spinning materials (one of the wool substitute). This type of product has become obsolete after the war, and operations cannot begin unless all the original machinery is renovated. Furthermore, the current amount of silk and grass in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai has exceeded the amount of silkworms produced by more than 30%. Silk factories in various places are unable to operate at full capacity throughout the year due to a lack of raw materials. Therefore, there is no need to renovate the two factories' ordinary silk machines to resume operations.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Medical &amp; Health</h3>
<p>(I) Chronic Cough</p>
<p>Zhu Guanghua asks: I am already seventeen years old, but still haven't developed. I am as thin as a rail, and often suffer from asthma. Medications are ineffective. Recently, I had an X-ray, which revealed a dark spot in my lung, but no other symptoms of lung disease were observed. I would like to ask: (1) Is this condition bronchitis or pneumonia? (2) Does this condition affect development? (3) What medicine can cure this condition?</p>
<p>[Answer by Medical Doctor Tang Renjin] Judging from the points mentioned in your letter, it can be definitely diagnosed as asthma, which is also related to the climate. Here are the answers to your three questions:——</p>
<p>(1) It is definitely not pneumonia. Whether you had bronchitis in the past is unknown. (2) It does have an impact on physical development. (3) During attacks, in addition to anti-asthmatic drugs, Anto Vaccin or Asthmolzsin can be used. Changing location for recuperation (dry climate, such as Pingjin, etc.) sometimes also produces good results. It is more difficult, but after development and growth, it can sometimes be cured.</p>
<p>(II) Opacity in One Eye</p>
<p>Lin Yongming asks: Last year, I suffered from conjunctivitis, which took over a month to heal. However, since then, my vision has been blurred. I consulted a specialist doctor who said it was corneal opacity and required long-term medication to clear it, but there has been no improvement to date. I don't know how to treat it.</p>
<p>[Answer by Medical Doctor Tang Renjin] Your condition is likely corneal opacity, or Pannus caused by trachoma. It cannot be definitively diagnosed without a personal examination. Neither is an incurable disease, and ophthalmologists can diagnose and treat them. As for the pain in the right brain, you can try taking Phenacetin Comp. Tabl or Veganin Tabl. If it is ineffective, you should seek treatment from an internist immediately. Also, please have an ENT doctor examine your nasal cavity for any illnesses.</p>

<h3>Textbook Shortage Feared After Restrictions on Paper Imports</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Recently, the government adopted a quota allocation system for paper imports.

Recently, the Ministry of Education has adopted a free printing and supply method for national textbooks, and there are no statistics on the number of prints. Moreover, the Ministry of Education has set price limits for the celebration price. Under the current situation of high paper prices and printing costs, it is heard that major publishing companies have no intention of continuing to operate this business, which has no legal protection of copyright property and no guarantee of operation.

Flour supply and demand were balanced, but the supply of foreign flour was plentiful, and the situation was clearly weak, falling slightly by 300-500 yuan. Bran sales remained strong in rural areas, continuing to rise by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were sought after by Shanxia and Taiwanese traders, and the market was brisk, rising steadily and increasing by over 1,000 yuan again.</p>
<p>Yellow soybeans were successively absorbed by Nanyang factories and local firms, with strong demand and rising prices, continuing to rise by 3,000-4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were selling well for foreign firms and were increasingly popular, gradually soaring and rapidly rising by 12,000-13,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were actively sold in Nanyang, tightly locked, fragrant and dry, rising steadily and continuing to rise by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Sorghum rose by 1,000 yuan, following the increase in other goods. Broad beans were firm, and wheat was stable. Corn continued to be in demand by alcohol factories, rising by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Red beans also rose by 1,000-2,000 yuan, while soybeans remained in a situation of raised prices and increased demand.</p>
<p>In the oil market, shipments from Qingdao were scarce, and production prices were high. Clear oil surged dramatically by over 10,000 yuan. Soybean oil and raw oil had not opened, but the situation was also rising steadily in the background. In the afternoon, oil merchants held a meeting to discuss supply and sales methods for edible oil.</p>
<h3>Automobile Imports Prohibited; Strictly Enforced Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Amid the restrictions on automobile imports, new automobiles continue to arrive in abundance. According to the person in charge of the Import Administration, new automobiles will not be allowed to be imported or sold from February to April of this year. Only private automobiles with complete documents and confirmed for private use will be allowed to enter. The automobiles currently arriving in abundance were approved during the first commission in the winter of last year. The deadline for their mass import had long expired, but due to the short time frame and incomplete handling of procedures, the deadline for importing approved automobiles has been extended to the 25th of this month. As the deadline is approaching again, the office notified relevant inspection agencies yesterday. Today is the last day for automobile merchants to import new automobiles. Starting tomorrow, the import of large quantities of automobiles from abroad for sale in Shanghai will be prohibited. Whether automobile imports will be allowed in the second quarter of this year is still under consideration by the office.</p>
<h3>Report on Inspection of Banks and Money Shops Submitted to the Ministry of Finance for Approval</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] The inspection work of banks and money shops in Shanghai was previously carried out by the Ministry of Finance, the Auditing Department of the Central Bank of China, and the Jin Chao Team of the Garrison Command, lasting two months and now coming to an end. All reports were previously carried by Mao, a counselor from the Ministry of Finance, and Gao Fang, director of the Auditing Department, to Beijing to present them to Minister Yu in person. It is reported that a total of 44 companies were inspected this time. How the case will be handled separately in the future will be decided by the Ministry of Finance based on the report. There are no plans for a second inspection, as rumored. However, the Ministry of Finance's original plan to inspect Shanghai's banking industry annually will likely begin in the near future. It is reported that Counselor He of the Ministry of Finance has arrived in Shanghai and is currently consulting with the Auditing Department of the Central Bank on how to proceed.</p>
<h3>White Coal Briquettes Are Firm</h3>
<p>Due to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' approval of the Shanghai Regional Fuel Management Committee's request, white coal and coke will be purchased by the government and not allowed to be freely transported, so holders are taking the opportunity to raise prices, and market prices have risen sharply. The market for bituminous coal dust remains weak, while the market for bituminous coal briquettes is short of goods, and market prices are extremely strong. Bituminous coal storage blocks are flat. Coal balls sales in various stores remain slow, and factory prices may fall again.</p>
<h3>4,000 Cases of Rayon Have Been Shipped from Japan</h3>
<p>[Our Report] It is reported that the first batch of rayon from Japan, totaling 4,000 cases, exchanged by the Central Trust Bureau this year has been shipped from Japan and arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the bureau continued to allocate rayon to the silk weaving industry as usual, based on 1/5 of the amount applied for in December of last year, totaling over 570 cases, with the allocation price remaining the same.</p>
<h3>Tea Exporters Raise Opinions on Loan Suspicions and Promotion Methods; Central Bank and Tea Merchants Exchange Views; Submit to the Executive Yuan for Approval After Consultation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] For the export of tea in 1946, after the Central Bank convened a meeting with the Agricultural Bank of China, the Central Trust Bureau, and relevant tea merchants to discuss solutions (details were recorded in this newspaper on March 13), it is now reported that the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association has officially written to the Central Bank, based on the opinions discussed on that day, proposing four points to change the "Packing Loan" and centralized promotion methods, as follows: 1. The Central Bank instructs the Central Trust Bureau to lead representatives of various tea merchants to organize a promotion committee to export and promote all boxed tea. 2. Please have the Central Trust Bureau provide packing loans of 120%, and after repaying the principal and interest of the mortgage loan from Zhongchen Bank, the remaining funds will be disbursed to the tea merchants. 3. All remaining Kihong, Tunlu, and Pinglu tea that has not been mortgaged, as well as Wenhong, Wenlu, Ninghong, and Kihong by-products such as flower scents, should also be approved for packing loans in the same way. 4. The sales price obtained from the promotion, after expenses, should be converted into legal tender according to the current exchange rate to repay all principal and interest of the packing loan. The remaining amount will be settled with the tea merchants at 70%, and 30% will be given to the Central Trust Bureau. It is heard that the Central Bank has also replied, agreeing to the first point without objection. Regarding the second point, the Central Bank stated that "packing loans" are commercial transactions. In the future, tea merchants cannot claim that they cannot sell all the exported tea and not repay the loans. Regarding the third point, the Central Bank agreed to include the remaining 4,000 dan of Kihong, Tunlu, and Pinglu tea that has not been mortgaged in the packing loan. Other teas such as Wenhong and flower scents are awaiting approval from Vice President Liu. Regarding the fourth point, the Central Bank believes that the sales price obtained from the promotion should be used to deduct the purchase cost (i.e., the price stipulated in the original purchase plan), packing loan interest, and export expenses, and then the remaining amount should be settled with the tea merchants at 70%, and 30% should be given to the national treasury. The above-mentioned plan exchanged by the Central Bank and the tea merchants will be implemented after being approved by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Many Cotton Yarn Sellers; Prices Fall Compared to Saturday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market opened fairly stable, but as buyers held back and many traders sold, 20-count to 32-count yarn fell by 80,000-90,000 compared to last Saturday. 42-count double-strand yarn fell more significantly due to the continued offerings from Fangjian Company, and local factories had ample inventory, falling by 120,000-130,000 compared to last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Sugar and Cloth Shipped North</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyu ship sailed to Tianjin the day before yesterday, carrying over 8,790 bags of sugar, over 1,500 pieces of cloth, over 1,350 pieces of cotton yarn, over 4,800 cases of cigarettes, over 420 pieces of tea, 820 pieces of paper, and miscellaneous goods totaling over 44,000 pieces.</p>
<h3>Yarn Industry Market Establishes Market Management Rules</h3>
<p>In order to bring market transactions into order, the Yarn Industry Market in this city has specially formulated market management rules, which will be officially announced and implemented today. The main points are as follows: (1) Permitted entry units and number of people: 1. National industry member companies shall not exceed two people. 2. Yarn brokers must join the Yarn Broker Association as members. 3. State-owned and private yarn factories are allowed eight people each. 4. Replenishing factories and merchants are allowed to send one representative each. (2) Matters needing attention for representatives of each unit in the market: 1. Whether it is the buyer or the seller, they must deal in spot cotton yarn. 2. In principle, both parties shall complete the transaction on the same day after the transaction is completed. If there is a separate procedure for the delivery date, it must be agreed by both parties. (3) Representatives of industry members are limited to spot goods for the sale of cotton yarn by their own company or for selling on behalf of customers. If they are selling goods, they should abide by legal profits. If they are selling on behalf of customers, they should be limited to commission income. (4) The representatives of each yarn factory shall, in principle, sell the products of their own factory. (5) Representatives of each merchant, whether replenishing industries or merchants from all over the country, shall, in principle, purchase the cotton yarn they actually need. However, in addition to replenishing factories in this city, if merchants from all over the country need to resell cotton yarn that has already been purchased due to changes in its use, they should only sell it to industry members of this association. (6) Yarn brokers shall limit their business scope to introducing transactions between buyers and sellers and shall only take the stipulated commission amount as their income. (7) All transactions shall be signed with a transaction order, indicating the name, quantity, price, and delivery location of the goods, and signed as the standard. (8) All parties selling goods shall not engage in illegal acts such as speculative manipulation and price gouging and shall comply with all laws and regulations related to the management of cotton yarn announced by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Five Types of Imported Materials Approved Last Winter Must Be Imported Before the End of This Month</h3>
<p>The Customs Import Administration was an independent agency. Since the establishment of the Import Management Committee, the work of the agency has been incorporated into the committee, but it still handles the review of five types of imported materials, namely sugar, tobacco leaves, gasoline, automobiles, and films, according to past regulations. It is reported that the above-mentioned five types of materials approved last winter must be imported before the end of this month, and contracts will be cancelled if they are overdue.</p>
<h3>Silver Shops Hold Joint Meeting to Discuss How to Resume Business; Representatives Sent to the Municipal Government and Social Affairs Bureau to Request Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Report] After the Ministry of Finance separately formulated ten management measures for the receipt, redemption, and manufacture of gold jewelry in the silver shop industry, the silver shop industry in this city and representatives of the same industry from Ping, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hubei and other places held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to discuss how to manage the industry after the promulgation and implementation of the new management measures. According to the news released by the industry after the meeting, since the promulgation of the measures for the disposal of gold jewelry, the silver shop industry nationwide has suspended business at the same time and has twice submitted requests to the relevant authorities in the central government, stating their grievances, which have been considered and adopted. Now that the Ministry of Finance has separately formulated and promulgated new management measures, there has been no response to the industry's request to allocate raw materials from the Central Bank in various places. Article 4 of the measures still has gaps. Namely: (1) In the future, it will be difficult to balance the receipt and redemption of gold jewelry. As a result, there will only be redemption and no receipt, creating a phenomenon of excess demand over supply, which the industry is really uneasy about. The industry has always held a small profit position, and the price difference between entry and exit is not expected to be too far, so that it is in line with the actual situation, and customers are happy to buy and redeem. (2) Regarding the approval of prices by the competent authorities, it is hoped that it will be based on the principle of speed and simplification, and the industry association will submit a request for record. Therefore, the business hours of the industry must be discussed with the competent authorities before a decision can be made. It is reported that the industry has appointed Yao Lianfang, Yao Guiqing, Wu Pengnian, Chen Dezhang, Qiu Yunken, and other five people to submit a request to the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau this morning to ask for instructions on future business issues.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the silver shop industry in Nanjing will also hold a meeting with representatives from Anhui and Hunan today to discuss future business issues and will request the Ministry of Social Affairs and other agencies to amend the measures.</p>
<h3>Fangjian Sells Yarn</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn on behalf of the Textile Management Committee as usual yesterday, selling a total of 2,042 pieces, including 1,654 pieces for manufacturers and 388 pieces for yarn numbers. There were a total of 1,244 applicants, including 877 manufacturers and 367 yarn numbers.</p>
<h3>New Price for Cotton Yarn Acquisition Announced: Textile Control Board Implements Immediately; February Difference Also Paid Out</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The new price for cotton yarn acquisition in March, after being approved by the Overall Economic Council's Price Committee, has been instructed and issued to the Textile Control Board yesterday and will be implemented immediately. The maximum acquisition price for 20-count standard yarn is 3.15 million yuan per piece. Currently, the Textile Control Board will issue a preliminary amount of 2.8 million yuan per piece for cotton yarn acquired this month, regardless of its count or type. Furthermore, regarding the February acquisition price for yarn, after the price of 20-count standard yarn was adjusted from 2.5 million yuan to 2.75 million yuan per piece, the Textile Control Board has completed the issuance of the difference as of yesterday.</p>
<p>The adjusted acquisition prices for various counts of cotton yarn in February are as follows (in thousands of yuan): 6-count 1381 yuan, 8-count 1648 yuan, 10-count 1915 yuan, 10-count B 1701 yuan, 12-count 2083 yuan, 14-count 2250 yuan, 16-count 2416 yuan, 20-count 2750 yuan, 20-count double-strand 1989 yuan, 21-count 2854 yuan, 21-count double-strand 2921 yuan, 22-count 2986 yuan, 23-count 3118 yuan, 26-count 3427 yuan, 30-count three-strand 4243 yuan, 31-count 3872 yuan, 32-count 4044 yuan, 32-count double-strand 4317 yuan, 33-count 4181 yuan, 34-count 4318 yuan, 40-count 5142 yuan, 40-count three-strand 5594 yuan, 42-count 5388 yuan, 42-count double-strand 5083 yuan, 42-count three-strand 5868 yuan, 60-count 7924 yuan, 60-count double-strand 8604 yuan, 80-count 11051 yuan, 80-count double-strand 12091 yuan, 84-count 11603 yuan. The prices of all the above yarn counts include commodity tax and are based on Grade A yarn. In addition, the acquisition prices for Grades B, C, D, and E differ by 2.5% for each grade. Each piece of cotton yarn is based on 400 pounds of machine-packed cotton yarn as the standard.</p>
<p>It has been learned that after the decision was made that the maximum factory price for free trading of cotton yarn by private factories in March should not exceed 3.7 million yuan for 20-count standard yarn, the excess portion of each 400-pound piece of cotton yarn from private factories in the city will not be proportionally priced upward because it does not comply with the standard yarn regulations.</p>
<h3>Orders for Soda Ash and Ammonium Sulfate Have Arrived</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] It is reported that the sales of soda ash in the city have become sluggish. Yongli Company has shipped 450 tons of soda ash from Tianjin, but cannot accommodate it, and has distributed it to Hankou, Shantou, Chongqing and other places. The sales order for ammonium sulfate has expired, and the goods within the customs gate are in short supply. Yongli also has limited inventory because the Nanjing Ammonium Sulfate Factory has stopped production. The factory price has been frequently raised, to 3 million yuan per ton. The market sales have become active, but the largest customer, the Taiwanese group, has not yet arrived in Shanghai to purchase.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Market Quiet</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, there was no large-scale trading of tung oil in the market. There were occasional futures transactions, but the amount was small. The spot price for full-weight white oil barrels was 440,000 yuan, with few sales. The sales of Xihong oil were still good, at 370,000 yuan per barrel of 83 market catties, and seemed to be slightly higher. Aohong oil was little changed.</p>
<h3>Bristle Prices Decline Again</h3>
<p>Pigs: Foreign prices are frequently falling, and the market situation is extremely weak. The price of Shanghai bristles has also turned weak. The delivery price for New Spinning bristles has fallen from US$2.10 to US$2.00 per pound, Sichuan bristles to US$2.50, and Hankou bristles to US$3.50. Yesterday, the market price for Shanghai bristles in boxes (133 pounds) was 2.8 million yuan per sima dan, a decrease of 10,000 yuan compared to Saturday, equivalent to 3,176,000 yuan in national currency at the foreign exchange rate. Sichuan bristles were quoted at 3.8 million yuan, with no transactions, equivalent to 3,970,000 yuan in national currency at the foreign exchange rate. Hankou bristles were quoted at 5.2 million yuan, also with no transactions, equivalent to 5,717,000 yuan in national currency at the foreign exchange rate. The prices of all bristles are higher than foreign prices, and exporters are unable to purchase them.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Cotton Spinning Engineering</h3>
<p>— Lü De</p>
<p>This comprehensive book, divided into two volumes, the first volume of which was published in the middle of this month, is sold by Longmen Bookstore. In addition, Jian Shui He Da's recent book "Textile Mechanics" contains new and unique material. Both of these books are very suitable for reading by those in the textile industry.</p>
<h3>After the Cancellation of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank, Export Subsidies Can Still Be Granted</h3>
<p>After the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank was cancelled, regarding the announced export subsidy measures, if export foreign exchange is sold to designated banks, a double subsidy can still be granted. However, when designated banks pay this subsidy to exporters on behalf of the government, they must comply with the following regulations: (1) Calculation standard: The subsidy is based on the starting price of the goods at the port of export, and transportation insurance costs are not included. (2) Payment time: The subsidy is paid when the exporter submits all export documents to the designated bank. (3) Reimbursement by the Central Bank: The subsidies paid by the designated banks can be settled with the Central Bank at the beginning of each week, based on the total export foreign exchange income of the previous week. However, designated banks may also request immediate reimbursement from the Central Bank at any time. (4) Entrusted exports: From now on, designated banks must not, without the permission of the Shanghai Central Bank Business Bureau or its branches, accept export goods sold by foreign firms and issue customs export certificates for such export goods. The application for this entrustment must be accompanied by the exporter's official invoice, stating the name of the ship, the trustee, the nature, quantity, etc. of the goods. The application may be approved on a case-by-case basis. The payment of the subsidy by the bank must wait until the price of the goods has been received. The payment for these export goods must be received within six months and must be guaranteed by the entrusted bank.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from Yan'an Before the Restoration</h3>
<p>— A Taoyuan Air Dispatch on the 14th, by Huang He</p>
<p>I recently obtained a copy of a secret internal directive document from the Communist Party in the Jiji-Jin area. It roughly stated: "The basic task of our party at present is to overthrow the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship government, seize political power, and establish a proletarian dictatorship. In order to accomplish this overall political goal, all regions must fully support military victories, actively complete the mobilization of militia to participate in the war and expand the army. We must destroy social ruling forces, severely crack down on wealthy landlords and rich peasants, and the gentry class to create chaos in rural areas and agitate the peasants, so as to increase the difficulties for the Kuomintang's governments at all levels, reduce their prestige, and prevent the replenishment of stubborn troops (referring to the open army). We must also use various forms and slogans to mobilize the people to oppose the Kuomintang's dictatorship, and oppose American aid to China. We must strictly implement the food and material blockade policy, and universally destroy the railway transportation that the stubborn troops regard as their lifeline. All cadres must resolutely overcome the concept of peace, prepare for twelve years of armed struggle. Regarding the people's widespread war-weariness, we should expand the propaganda of 'use armed struggle to win peace' and 'there will be no genuine peace unless the Kuomintang's rule is overthrown,' mobilize forces, and gradually change this mentality."</p>
<p>This secret directive document is truly a confession of their launch of war, destruction of peace, and all conspiracies and crimes in various regions!</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bai Sha Jun, a young cultural worker from Yan'an, presented me with his recently completed "Miscellaneous Thoughts on Yan'an." After reading it, I couldn't help but feel emotional. The "Yan'an" formerly touted itself as a free garden of new Chinese culture. However, the cultural workers who pioneered this free garden were subjected to unbearable contempt and attacks, to the point where they didn't even have the freedom to breathe. Reality made them pessimistic, disappointed, and depressed, but the Communist Party further placed their lives in a bleak situation. Those who know the inside story of the Communist Party are not surprised, but it is indeed necessary for the general readers who do not have a deep understanding to observe calmly. I have specially selected excerpts from the "Collection of Miscellaneous Thoughts" related to cultural figures in Yan'an to inform distant readers:</p>
<p>"Wild Lily" is Thorny; "August Village" is Unfortunate</p>
<p>The writer Wang Shiwei is one of the most unyielding. The Communist Party added the so-called "National Special," "Japanese Special," and "Special Envoy" titles to him, but people jokingly called him "Three Departments." However, he was somewhat unyielding to the evil forces, so he is still imprisoned today, and his thorny "Wild Lily" is still deeply stinging the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Another person who, after Wang Shiwei, has a bit of backbone is the author of "August Village," Xiao Jun. I remember when "Artists and Politicians" was causing an uproar, he boldly poured cold water on it, scolding it as "dogs fighting." He gave full play to the instincts of an artist, but the increased pressure in life forced him to set up a small stall in the new market in Yan'an. When his wife's due date was approaching, the writer was on the verge of having no rice to cook. If it weren't for the fact that he fortunately met a kindred spirit, a shepherd boy, who gave him half a catty of millet a day, he would have awaited "newness" while he himself was about to "metabolize." How unfortunate is "August Village"!</p>
<p>Li Youran Asks for Porcelain Teeth; Chen Tie Geng Gets Mental Illness</p>
<p>The translator Li Youran, after all, had a nine-point "old-fashioned" aura. When he was surrounded and struggled against by the so-called "masses," the atmosphere was tense, but he remained calm as usual, not showing any fear. Standing on the podium, he kept confessing to everyone that he was not a special agent. As a result, after being "bound hand and foot" and beaten up, he still asked the chairman to compensate him for the porcelain teeth that had been knocked out.</p>
<p>Under the same struggle, the woodcarver Chen Tie Geng was frightened by this and became mentally ill, smiling at people all day long. It is said that Chen was an important cadre who had held many positions, but his composure was much worse than that of Mr. Li. This may be because he was older.</p>
<p>Hei Ding is Forced to Confess; Chang Hong Gets Hit on the Head</p>
<p>Hei Ding was forced to confess his "special agent" relationship, and that was not enough. He was also forced to report on the history of special agents at the "Lu Xun Academy of Arts." In a helpless situation, he pointed out that Ai Qing, Hu Feng, Mao Dun and others were all Kuomintang special agents, and said that the Kuomintang was really rich and that these people were completely bought with a lot of money. At the time, many people didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>In addition, the old poet Gao Chang Hong, former member of the "Crazy Wind Society," in order to pursue "revolutionary truth," did not hesitate to travel over mountains and rivers, experiencing hardships on a long journey, from the rear to Yan'an. As soon as he entered the border area of "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia" at Gulin, he was detained by the local county government. After many explanations, he was still not released. As a result, he was escorted to Yan'an. As soon as he arrived, he was put under "special agent" surveillance by the Communist Party because "Lu Xun had scolded him." The second time, when people were silently holding rectification discussion meetings, this white-haired and honest man suddenly appeared in front of people with blood flowing. Gao cried, "Iodine iodine!" This "newcomer" was accused of hating the Communist Party and was hit on the head with a stick. From then on, people never saw Gao Chang Hong again, nor did they ever see his "political poems."</p>
<p>"Boredom" Rubs Bellies; Spring Breeze Sends Songs</p>
<p>Precisely because culture is boring, "folk dances" are popular in Yan'an. Every Saturday night, a group of mentally distressed and extremely bored cultural figures and young students gather in the courtyard or on the open ground under the moon to dance. Accompanied by the monotonous erhu, some even dance all night long. When the villagers saw this, they couldn't help but sigh and say, "Why rub your bellies so hard?" How could they know that these gentlemen were really bored!</p>
<p>Before the restoration, Yan'an presented a desolate scene. In the hazy moonlit nights of the sweeping sands, the songs of young people often echoed in the cold air: "Some are hugging their wives, some are pessimistic and disappointed," and also adapted from the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" school song, "On the banks of the Yellow River, a group of people have frozen to death, the Chinese nation, unlucky descendants..." which also often blew into people's ears with the spring breeze.</p>
<h3>Discussing the UNRRA Executive Headquarters Social Welfare Work Conference and Reviewing the Executive Headquarters' Emergency Relief and Welfare Undertakings in the Past Year (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— De Wei and Zhan Dehou</p>
<p>In terms of food relief, in addition to distributing grain, collective feeding stations were also set up in refugee settlement areas or areas with severe food shortages. Refugees could come to the stations to eat. There were many types of stations, including porridge factories, affordable canteens, nutrition stations, and steamed bread and pancake distribution stations. The number of stations established by each branch office ranged from eight to seventy, totaling 138, benefiting 8,379,426 people. In addition, Hunan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hubei, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Shandong used mobile kitchen cars shipped from Australia to travel around areas with large numbers of refugees to help them eat. These kitchen cars could prepare food for 600 people within an hour. During the winter relief, the food prepared by the kitchen cars was placed at several fixed distribution points, and many families who could not cook led their children, bringing utensils to the stations to receive the food and take it home. In addition to general food and clothing relief, in order to solve the housing problem for refugees returning to their hometowns, the Executive Headquarters allocated special funds to the Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, and Guangxi branch offices for construction in the most severely damaged cities and villages, building public housing or "good neighbor" new villages. Other branch offices also allocated funds from their operating expenses to repair houses or use military tents to build temporary shelters and refugee dormitories. In Jiangxi, the emergency measure for housing was to organize refugees in a work-relief program to build low walls with mud and use tents as roofs, organizing tent villages for the refugees to live in themselves. Welfare was implemented in the villages, and sanitation was managed. In order to save manpower and financial resources, these tasks were organized by the villagers themselves, and the branch offices were only responsible for providing materials and guidance.</p>
<p>(1) Placement of Dependent Children</p>
<p>The principle for the placement of dependent refugee children is to return those with families to their families, and those with relatives to their relatives, so that they can re-experience normal and warm love. The Executive Headquarters sent more than 210,000 refugee children back to their hometowns with their families and assisted the Wartime Child Welfare Association in sending 2,256 nursery students back to their hometowns. For those who truly had no home or relatives to return to, the branch offices cooperated with local original social welfare organizations to establish 15 temporary shelters for dependent children, accommodating more than 8,000 children. More than 5,000 children were entrusted to existing orphanages.</p>
<p>(2) Promoting Child Nutrition</p>
<p>The Executive Headquarters used milk and cod liver oil shipped from abroad by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). Since September of last year, nutrition stations have been established, using 20,000 tons of materials, and adding canned food, soy flour, and noodles. Some nutrition stations have been transformed into supply stations to launch a child nutrition subsidy campaign. Experts hired by the headquarters guide the branch offices on how to use nutritional materials and how to prepare children's diets. The purpose of the Executive Headquarters is, on the one hand, to remedy the damage to children's health, and on the other hand, to let these poor parents know what the minimum standard for children's diets is (milk and cod liver oil are of course not included), so that they know to strive for what human beings should have. Currently, the Executive Headquarters has a total of 1,872 stations. Adding the number of nutrition stations subsidized by primary schools, the total is more than 20,000 stations, supplying more than 2 million children. When the Executive Headquarters ends, we hope that the government and social organizations that promote nutrition will cooperate to continue to develop this work, so that poor children can enjoy their due rights.</p>
<p>(3) Running Daycare Centers for Working Women</p>
<p>In order to coordinate work, each branch office entrusted local relevant organizations to run daycare centers for poor working women, especially in disaster areas, using these centers to settle children, while invisibly stabilizing countless families, so as to avoid them running in groups to the area under the jurisdiction of another branch office, which would cause some administrative difficulties for the Executive Headquarters. Young and strong parents were able to work on work-relief projects, while their children were raised for free. The number of daycare centers set up in An Dun was the largest, with 433 centers, caring for 28,145 children. The other branch offices had a total of only 15 centers, with thousands of children.</p>
<p>(4) Establishing Child Welfare Stations</p>
<p>Nutrition stations and daycare centers naturally developed into child welfare stations. To the extent possible, the branch offices divided a city into many districts. In each district, they entrusted the organization that co-organized the daycare center or nutrition station with the Executive Headquarters to take care of the poor children in the district and become a child welfare station, handling material distribution, medical and health care, education, entertainment, and family life guidance. This work was done best in Beiping. The branch offices have a total of 173 stations, with approximately 110,000 children. However, this system is still in its infancy. It is hoped that in the future, the government will divide all cities and villages in the country into child welfare districts, with a central station in each district to handle all child welfare matters in the district, so that this method can become a permanent system.</p>
<p>(5) Agency Subsidies and Improvements</p>
<p>The agencies subsidized by the Executive Headquarters can be divided into public and private relief homes, orphanages, nursing homes, disabled rehabilitation homes, and other social welfare organizations. The purpose is to restore the original relief agencies for the elderly, young, and disabled in the recovered areas and to increase the number of people accommodated in conjunction with the work of the Executive Headquarters. The method of subsidies can be divided into the supply of clothing and food, assistance with repairs, cash subsidies, and talent training. The subsidies of materials and cash are adopted with a decreasing method, so that they can gradually find ways to be self-sufficient. The branch offices have subsidized a total of 2,178 units, of which 531 are children's agencies, with 60,000 children. This work was done the most by the Shanghai branch office, which subsidized a total of 137 units. The remaining branch offices subsidized between 15 and 60 units. The Executive Headquarters also stipulated standards for the administration and operation of the subsidized agencies to help them gradually improve and raise the standards of China's relief and welfare undertakings. Because the life of the Executive Headquarters was too short, this work, which requires a long time to be effective, did not achieve many results, but the establishment of this standard was an unprecedented move in China.</p>
<p>Regarding the work of caring for the elderly and disabled, in addition to subsidizing agencies for the elderly and disabled, the Executive Headquarters has begun two experimental projects, both of which are aimed at enabling the disabled to be self-reliant and gain physical and psychological treatment, restore physical and mental health, and provide vocational training, so that they can return to a normal psychological and social life. The difference between these two experiments lies in the method. One is to use new scientific equipment and foreign experts to assist the Ministry of Social Affairs in running a disabled rehabilitation institute. The Executive Headquarters has spent a total of US$441,100 on purchasing equipment in the United States and providing necessary equipment from the materials already shipped to China by the Executive Headquarters. The other method is to cooperate with the Chinese Vocational Education Society, using existing hospitals, ordinary shops, and small industries in the city as places for training and employment for the disabled. This method can be implemented in any city in China without a lot of expenses. The Executive Headquarters is only using its short life to create a permanent job.</p>
<p>After eight years of hard fighting, the Executive Headquarters invested the above-mentioned relief and welfare work against the background of such a large disaster in our country, which is indeed disproportionate to the background. One of the reasons is that both UNRRA and the Executive Headquarters lack experience in this unprecedented international and national relief work, but the other reason is the continued outbreak of civil war, the obstruction of transportation, the complexity of the political situation, and the instability of the economy. In this environment, no organization can perfectly complete the task of post-war relief. Experience tells us that social welfare work cannot solve social problems single-handedly. If you only focus on welfare work and forget the entire political and economic system, it is easy for welfare work to become a tool behind undemocratic politics and bureaucratic capitalism. The eyes of those who compile and publish works should be widened, and always remember that your work must go hand in hand with political and economic improvements.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Reporter Delegation's Trip to Hangzhou: A Special Report</h3>
<p>— By Our Reporter Tu Peilin</p>
<p>The two railway bureaus jointly invited reporters from various Shanghai newspapers to visit Hangzhou. A group of twenty-two people departed on the morning of the 20th. After arriving in Hangzhou, in addition to visiting Zhijiang University, the Qiantang River, and touring various scenic spots, they also visited local leaders such as Chairman Shen and Mayor Zhou. Because Chairman Shen had to go to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, Secretary-General Lei received them in his stead. On the 22nd, they were treated with a banquet, during which Secretary-General Lei provided detailed information about the administrative facilities and economic conditions of Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Lei Discusses Administrative Facilities</p>
<p>Secretary-General Lei stated: Zhejiang Province currently faces many difficulties, the biggest being finance. The budget for this year is over 500 million, but there is a shortfall of about 100 million. The largest source of income is the land tax. The province retains 20% of the land tax, while the remaining 80% is divided equally between the central government and the local governments. The main administrative project this year is the seawall construction. Last year, it cost , of which 4 billion was allocated by the central government, and 2 billion was materials and flour from the United Relief Services. This year, another 110 million is needed. The central government has sent personnel to survey the area several times, as it is considered a burden beyond the capacity of the local government. Because the Qiantang River originates in Anhui and flows mostly through Zhejiang Province, and benefits Songjiang and other counties in Jiangsu, a request has been made for the central government to allocate funds. The central government is currently considering this. Once the project is completed, cargo can be shipped from Nanxing Bridge in Hangzhou out to sea, which will greatly benefit the commercial prosperity of Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>Land Transportation Actively Promoted</p>
<p>In terms of land transportation, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been open to Yiwu since March 1st. It is expected to reach Jinhua soon, and by the end of June, it may be extended westward from Jiangshan into Jiangxi Province. Regarding highways, the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway has been opened to Yixing. The Shanghai-Hangzhou and Hangzhou-Huizhou roads are also expected to be open to military use soon. In addition, the coastal line from Ningbo to Wenzhou is under active construction. There are also plans to enter Fujian via Quzhou and other places. If completed, this will be very convenient. The repair costs for this highway are stipulated to be the responsibility of the central government, but progress has been slow due to insufficient funding last year. The central government is scheduled to allocate 10 billion this year, and 1 billion has been received so far. For farmland irrigation projects, over 100 locations are planned to be completed this year, with over 500 more in the planning stages. If completed, food production will double, which will compensate for the chronic food shortages in Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>Emphasis on Specialty Products: Silk, Tea, and Fisheries</p>
<p>The main specialty products of Zhejiang Province are silk, tea, and fisheries. Currently, they have only recovered to 20-30% of pre-war levels. Last year, a loan of 20 billion was requested for silk production, but only 11 billion was allocated. This year, it is hoped to borrow 15 billion to actively restore mulberry orchards and improve silkworm breeds. Last year, a loan of 7.5 billion was requested for tea production. Due to domestic transportation obstacles and the tea farmers' financial difficulties, exports were poor. The goal for this year is to produce 150,000 to 160,000 dan, with a cost of 550,000 to 600,000 per dan. An application for a loan is being made to actively restore the market. Director Pi is currently negotiating with the United Relief Services. Regarding fisheries, it is hoped to obtain fishing boats and wood for building wooden boats after the victory. As a result of negotiations, it has been agreed to allocate 1,000 tons of wood. All preparations are now complete, awaiting the arrival of the goods for use. However, the boats can only be borrowed and not owned. An application for a fishery loan of 6 billion has been made this year, and the central government has agreed to consider it.</p>
<p>Public Educators are Striving to Fulfill Their Duties</p>
<p>In the past, the price index in Hangzhou exceeded that of Nanjing. However, the central government stipulated that the salaries of public educators in Beijing and Shanghai would be in the first tier, while Hangzhou was placed in the second tier. Fortunately, everyone is able to endure and strive to fulfill their duties for the sake of the country. Because of the small local population, there are many opportunities for interaction among party, government, military, and prominent figures in society. Therefore, it is easy to reach consensus, and they cooperate closely with one heart and one mind. As a result, problems such as the past rice shortages were resolved in a short period of time. The People's Assembly, a civil organization, is also able to cooperate with the administrative organs, working together for the public good, getting along harmoniously, and promoting work easily.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou Discusses the Current Situation in Hangzhou</p>
<p>Mayor Zhou of Hangzhou recently met with the Shanghai reporter delegation and discussed the general situation in Hangzhou, answering questions and stating: The population of Hangzhou was estimated to be 610,000 in 1937, but is now only about 500,000. During the war, the city suffered heavy damage, with 30% of the houses destroyed. The enemy and puppet regime collected all steel and metal materials for military use, even seizing the sewer covers, causing slag to accumulate and drainage to be poor. After the victory, it was very difficult to carry out this dredging work. The enemy and puppet regime left behind 23 tons of garbage. Four hundred cleaners have been working until now, and it is almost completely cleared. The electric lamp railings of West Lake were also damaged, and silt accumulated in the inner West Lake. After the restoration, repairs have been carried out successively until now, and the appearance has been mostly restored. Before the war, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had personally issued an order that it must be whitewashed every other year and painted every two years. The first step after the victory was to restore it.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Budget is 15 Billion</p>
<p>Thirty percent of the municipal government's total budget is allocated to the Bureau of Public Works for construction and road repairs. The total budget for this year is 15 billion. Last year, the central government stipulated that Hangzhou had 685 military service quotas, which were all filled. It has not yet been processed this year, and the quota is unknown. The general situation of industry and commerce is not good. Shanghai's market conditions can be transmitted to Hangzhou in ten minutes using long-distance telephones, so it is greatly affected. The calculation of workers' wages is different from Shanghai, mostly stipulated in terms of rice or money, and not calculated according to the cost of living index. The issue of banning dance halls is difficult to discuss. Since the People's Assembly has decided to ban them, then they will be banned. Mayor Zhou stated, "Fortunately, Hangzhou does not rely on dancing to prosper, so banning it doesn't matter."</p>

<h3>The Trend of Traditional Chinese Painting is Improving</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yingpeng</p>
<p>Brother Jinshan asked me to write a short article for the Spring and Autumn "Art Festival Special Issue," hoping to review the past and encourage the future. Although I have not neglected research recently, I deeply feel the inadequacy of my skills. I really lack the courage to express my opinions.</p>
<p>Let me briefly express my views on the changes in the trend of traditional Chinese painting in the thirty-odd years since the beginning of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The painting style at the beginning of the Republic of China was just the tail end of the late Qing Dynasty (Ren Bonian, etc.). It was difficult to change ingrained habits. No matter how accomplished the artists were, they could not escape the "vulgar atmosphere." Perhaps because the painters mostly lived in commercial ports and were constrained by the vulgar eyes of the common people, they had no choice but to apply red and silk, and perfunctorily deal with things in a "vulgar" way. Especially in Shanghai, under the conditions of semi-colonial comprador culture, it is not surprising that lofty and great ideas and productions could not be produced.</p>
<p>Having said that, the development of the printing industry in modern times has greatly contributed to the progress of traditional Chinese painting. Many people who were devoted to promoting art used printing to reproduce ancient masterpieces and promote their circulation. As the trend opened up, those who studied traditional Chinese painting gradually gained access to the standards of their predecessors, and their horizons were corrected.</p>
<p>After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Palace Museum in Beijing was opened, and the treasures it contained were also reproduced and circulated, and exhibitions were held several times. As a result, the perceptions of those who studied traditional Chinese painting were gradually improved.</p>
<p>The trend of traditional Chinese painting gradually turned towards purity at this time. However, at first, their vision was still shallow, and they could only recognize the unconstrained style of the Eight Great Masters and Shi Tao from the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. On the other hand, most painters abandoned the common practice of painting flowers and birds and pursued landscapes, which formed a special development of landscape painting.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, although there was fighting everywhere, traditional Chinese painting made significant progress. This is a very good phenomenon. In addition, the study of landscape painting has gradually expanded from the Yuan and Ming dynasties to the Tang, Five Dynasties, and Northern Song dynasties. The patterns tend to be rigorous, the brushwork tends to be meticulous, and the coloring tends to be bright and clean, and gradually the rules and regulations can be seen. It shows that the current stage of traditional Chinese painting has at least a revitalizing atmosphere and is no longer decadent.</p>
<p>From now on, we should strive for perfection, carry forward and expand, move from the scope of imitation to creation, from landscape to other departments, and from the study of domestic art to world art, then the future is limitless.</p>
<p>Culture influences national fortune, this is an unbreakable truth. Therefore, judging from the improvement of the trend of traditional Chinese painting, the future of the country is full of hope. I celebrate this Art Festival with this meaning.</p>
<h3>Unity, Effort, and Striving for Glory</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>On this day last year, when the Shanghai Art Association was formally established at the Kangle Restaurant, I said in my declaration, "I hope that artists across the country will unite and work together!" Now it has been a full year, and not only has the covenant not been fully practiced and achievements demonstrated; on the contrary, there are still a few people who, in order to satisfy their personal selfish desires, resort to any means and use all kinds of conspiracies to peddle art as a commodity, causing ridicule from all walks of life and being despised, and even causing the council to think that art is an "unnecessary educational scene." The fact that "art teachers" were first revoked and then merged may not be unrelated!</p>
<p>During the difficult Anti-Japanese War, the majority of loyal and virtuous art workers in the rear and on the front lines were still able to work together with one heart and one mind. That kind of vigorous spirit is still inspiring to think about! Unexpectedly, after the victory, there is such a bad trend, which is really painful!</p>
<p>"Art" is definitely not a decoration of life, nor is it a tool to entertain and relieve sorrow in times of joy and sorrow. It is an indispensable spiritual food for mankind. Whether it is a civilized or barbaric nation, each has its own artistic expression. Especially in our country, it has a glorious history of thousands of years, which is already known to the world. History tells us that the giant wheel of the times is constantly moving forward. We are currently facing a great era, and everything should unfold a new situation to keep pace with the times. However, only art seems to be particularly desolate in China today. Those engaged in art work are as rare as morning stars, and they still cannot cooperate with each other for their own sake. As a result, the power of art is always weak, and it is still not noticed by the society. If this phenomenon continues, not only will it be impossible to maintain the glory of history, but it will be in danger of disappearing.</p>
<p>On this day when everyone is excited, we should express a determination - to immediately abandon sectarian views, hold hands tightly, and move forward together!</p>
<p>Furthermore, today's Chinese art, although more backward than in the past, has many places that cannot be fully satisfied. But we have a great hope, hoping to cultivate more young authors, hoping that they will take on the heavy responsibility of building a new art cause in the new China! No matter what kind of construction and development of a certain cause, there will be different trends due to different social systems, only art is an exception, and its importance is absolutely general under any social system. Just like cells in the human body, in any class and in the physique of any race, there is no possibility of leaving or disappearing for a moment.</p>
<p>Some people say that art is only something that people with assets can enjoy. In other words, as the current phenomenon in China, it seems impossible. However, when the Soviet Union had the Great Revolution, the promotion of art movement was even more enthusiastic than usual! To put it closer, during the war in Japan, art workers and newspaper reporters could not only be exempted from military service, but also be intensively trained in batches and sent to various battlefields to create, and were treated like princes. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>In short, I believe that any movement and any cause, on the one hand, needs the country to promote and guide, and on the other hand, workers must unite and work hard! "Internal strife" and "civil war" are self-destructive.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the Art Festival</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>Art is the expression of mankind's desire to feel beauty, the manifestation of life force, and the epitome of social life. Artists are the guides of the world's light. They study art in order to seek a proper life, and create in order to express individuality and thought. However, because we are in a world full of incidents and a difficult living environment, coupled with material civilization, which dazzles people's eyes, people seem to be falling day by day in terms of spiritual cultivation. Life is mechanical, and utilitarianism is the guide. If this continues without seeking remedy, it will not only be a fatal injury to our country's art, but also a knife axe that cuts through human civilization.</p>
<p>Speaking of our country's art, since there has been history, there have only been three large-scale national exhibitions held by the public in the most recent twenty years. However, the locations of these three meetings are also limited to a corner of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Chongqing. Although it was a great success for a while, the number of people who appreciated it was small. And the exhibitions of ancient art are also few and far between. Or it is thought that there are often public and private exhibitions of various departments of ancient and modern art in various provinces and cities, which can also be satisfactory and better than nothing. However, these exhibits are mostly commercial displays, and even some of them are a mixture of genuine and fake, and full of ugliness, which are different from the nature of systematic research and observation, and different from pure art for art's sake. In addition, the existing art in various places has not been properly explored, preserved, treasured, and toured for exhibitions. On the contrary, some have been replaced, privately hidden, and stolen due to plagiarism and possession. There are even not a few who sell (give) public and private treasures to foreign countries for personal entertainment or to make a small profit. As for those who do not cherish them and allow them to be destroyed and ravaged, they are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>It has been more than a year and a half since Japan surrendered, and the period cannot be said to be short, and the publication of books and periodicals has mostly returned to normal. However, looking around the country, there is still no purely art publication published on a regular basis, which cannot but be said to be a regret for the Chinese art world.</p>
<p>Although there have been several publications of art books in the past, strictly speaking, the quality and quantity are not very substantial, not to mention that some of them are translated from foreign works, and are not their own works. If you want to study the art in the history of your own country, but you want to carry over the superficial works of foreigners and treat them as accurate, detailed, and precious materials, in terms of culture and academics, others may not despise or despise us, but we are also pitiful and ashamed enough. In recent decades, our greatest gains in art are probably the study of inscriptions on bronzes and oracle bone inscriptions, Zhao Ban bamboo slips, and the discovery of the Dunhuang Stone Room. However, let's look at Japan. They have made countless efforts in art and research books. Most of the materials belong to our country's public and private property. And we do not collect, select, organize, analyze and study to compile and print, but let others conduct extensive research and gather to complete it. Are we really adhering to the teachings of "gentlemen achieve the beauty of others" and "success does not have to be self-made"?</p>
<p>In the national education, the number of art (art) specialty schools, including public and private ones, is probably less than ten. And among these few art schools, may I ask how many of them are substantively rich, well-equipped, and able to meet the actual needs of teaching and learning? The insufficiency of funds and the lack of equipment have become a common phenomenon. In addition, the travel, advancement, and retreat of faculty members are often more persuasive, and those who preside over school affairs often run around for funds and personnel, wasting most of their energy and time. All these kinds of shabby and simplified losses are irreplaceable.</p>
<p>Food, clothing, housing, and transportation are the common needs of human daily life. However, the inspiration of the soul, the sustenance of life, and the great expression of the nation and country require art, but many people (including the government) have ignored it. Therefore, Cai Jiemin (Yuanpei) advocated "aesthetic education instead of religion," and the importance of aesthetic education is evident. If people only rely on food and clothing, it can be regarded as a happy life, I am afraid it is not so simple. The culture of Greece and Rome has been left to this day for thousands of years, and it is still a torch that illuminates the world. It has its own life force. Looking back at our country now: art schools are rare and incomplete; there is not a single art museum; large-scale art exhibitions are equal to the appearance of the "divine dragon"; the art buildings in various places are not properly preserved and organized, and they are allowed to be destroyed and abandoned; the country and society have no extensive practical support and encouragement for artistic creation; the publication of art books and periodicals is extremely desolate and poor; the promotion of international art exhibitions is rarely seen, and there are one or two, and the quality is not substantial; art criticism has not been established, and although some are published occasionally, there are relatively few that are strict, upright, and fair; museums and art galleries are lacking, and artists have no way to research and refer to them; the lives of artists are mostly difficult; some only study art for a year and a half, and then hold art exhibitions to earn a few liters; at the same time, there are also those who have been engaged in art for decades, but their works have no way out, and they are impoverished and unable to make ends meet; the work of art groups cannot be fully developed, especially there is no close contact with international art groups. Speaking of these phenomena at today's Art Festival, it is all the more regrettable and sighed.</p>
<p>How to correct social trends, how to build new art, this requires the power of the country and society to truly work hard, it is not something that one or two people can do. Occasionally, I have some thoughts and specially talk about them in a disorderly way, hoping to address the facts to remedy the shortcomings of the past and the present. There will be a new atmosphere in next year's Art Festival, which is not just what I personally expect.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Art of Painting of Revolutionary Party Members</h3>
<p>— Liang Lieya</p>
<p>When it comes to the art of painting in our country, I am afraid that it cannot be described in detail in one article or one chapter. Therefore, I will not talk about the old saying, but will specifically narrow the scope and record the art of painting of the revolutionary comrades who founded the Republic of China to inform the people of the country, and express our permanent remembrance together, and learn from their spirit of "innovation," "creation," "freedom," and "independence"; at the same time, it will be used to commemorate the Art Festival.</p>
<p>Only those with passion, wisdom, cultivation, and compassion are willing to sacrifice themselves to save the country and join the revolutionary alliance to eliminate evil forces. Therefore, the brushstrokes of those revolutionary party members who are good at painting are either lofty and unrestrained or full of heroic spirit. There are absolutely no works that steal false names or imitate and copy. Everyone can freely and smoothly use their own brush and ink to reveal their respective wisdom and reveal the law. I will briefly describe what I know as follows:</p>
<p>The flowers, plants, landscapes, and waters of Shi Jianru and Lu Haodong are bold and vigorous, come from nature, and have no astringency or heaviness. The Founding Father once said: "Jianru is intelligent and eager to learn, and is sincere and earnest. His talent and appearance are similar to Lu Haodong, and both of them can write poetry and paint."</p>
<p>Chen Shaobai and Pan Dawei have lofty brush and ink sentiments. The pine wind, moon, and water are not enough to compare with their Qinghua. The composition is skillful and can turn flat waves into strange surprises and transform saliva into jewels, so they can be different from the ordinary.</p>
<p>Su Shiguzi all sketches from life. The lines are clear and vigorous, and the air is ethereal. The paintings are all to express his "crazy, chivalrous, and gentle" spirituality, reaching the fairyland and not being stained by dust. The height of his talent is no longer available today. Li Shutong was unrestrained at first, but later became simple and pale. The artistic conception is serene, like a virgin's autumn frost. It is a pity that he did not make many works.</p>
<p>Tan Yan, and Zhang Jing occasionally use calligraphy to write orchids, bamboos, and Buddha images, which are also vigorous and divine.</p>
<p>Gao Geng sketches from life, writing lions, tigers, horses, monkeys, orioles, wild geese, etc., and even small animals, small flowers, and leaves, all in order to transmit their spirituality. The landscape is free and unrestrained. Without outlining, it can also write out the true scenery of the sounds of nature in the wind, rain, sunshine, and clear sky, so it is the most touching. In the last season of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, he and his brother Lun first founded the "True Picture News" in Qipan Street, Shanghai, not only to promote the revolution, but also to pioneer the trend of publishing picture news in our country. When he died, Comrade Lin Sen, Chairman of the National Government, inscribed on his tombstone "The Tomb of Gao Qifeng, the Saint of Painting."</p>
<p>Lin Wen painted bamboo when he was young, which was graceful and elegant, and his spiritual mood was revealed in it. He was unwilling to rely on others.</p>
<p>Jing Yiyuan also likes to paint bamboo. The section is few and clear, and it has reached a lofty and unrestrained realm, like his person.</p>
<p>Zhang Zeshan painted horses, and Yunhao painted portraits for the mountain king. He has the reputation of being able to "paint the skin and the spirit," but the characters he paints are also very expressive. I once saw him painting a portrait of Xu Yian in Huangshan, and painting a Buddha image for Lu Danlin's 30th birthday, which can be called a fine work.</p>
<p>Cai Shou's works are simple in spirit, but he does not imitate Nantian, nor does he paint Ni Yun, and he scribbles at will, with keen feelings; the high and elegant interest of his temperament jumps out on the paper. He wanted Zhang Qingcheng to worship Su Ziguzi and the monk as female disciples, but he did not learn from his teacher, but liked to paint flowers and small landscapes for his own enjoyment.</p>
<p>Lu Shachen wrote as soon as he was interested, with a vast artistic conception, unaware of the past and unaware of the present.</p>
<p>In addition, those who are still alive and known to me are Zhang Renjie, Gao Lun, He Xiangning, Li Qiuyun, Li Tiefu, Tian Heng, He Sui, and Chen Shuren, all of whom can write works with life and form their own style, which is different from the others.</p>
<p>The Tao comes from enthusiasm and wisdom, so it can be free from the constraints of others' painting methods, and each can find its own world. For the world and life, it is a new , from an independent artistic realm.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the Art Festival</h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>I am a Chinese painting artist, which means I am one of the art creators. Let me speak about Chinese painting:</p>
<p>Someone asked me, "Someone said Chinese painting is dead." I asked in return, "Can that person do Chinese calligraphy?" They said, "Yes." In that case, Chinese painting is not dead!</p>
<p>Someone asked me, "Someone said Chinese painting should be improved, and it must absorb the strengths of Western painting. What do you think?" I smiled and said, "That's also acceptable, but don't forget the strengths of Chinese painting. Moreover, don't confuse the strengths and weaknesses of Chinese and Western painting."</p>
<p>Someone asked me, "Actually, Chinese painting is very prosperous today! According to news articles, there are countless famous painters. Why do some still say it's declining?" I said, "Yes, there are indeed 'must-be' painters, and every 'jia' (family, school) is 'da' (grand, large). Don't you see 'chestnut kings' and 'squid kings' everywhere? Since anything can be called 'king,' how can every family not be grand and large? Taking a step back, it's always good for people to strive upwards! There's no need to look down on them!"</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, I had a crazy idea: I hoped that all the artists in the world would emulate the painting methods and spirit of the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties. I boldly shouted a slogan—to revive the landscape painting methods and spirit of the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties, and to view this revival as a path of re-creation as valuable as being reborn. After this slogan was shouted, someone asked me, "Since you want to create, why take such a big detour, using the methods and spirit of the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties as your path?" I said, "Methods are the external form, and spirit is the content. The artists of the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties possessed the spirit of learning from nature and creating with their own ingenuity. I believe that 'du' (degree, measure) is the unchanging law of the universe, and 'fa' (method) is the result of human thought. Using method to apply degree is what the landscape painters of the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties succeeded at. We should study how they obtained degree and how they generated method; even more, how they became the methods and standards of the Five Dynasties and Song landscape painters. You must know that the landscape paintings of that time still possessed the true original form and energy."</p>
<p>The Yuan, Ming, and early Qing dynasties added increasing complexity, although their methods had reached their peak. Later scholars, with their shallow understanding and superficial exploration, could not easily grasp the profound secrets, resulting in fleeting impressions and only a superficial understanding. Therefore, to seek the creative path of our predecessors, one must start from the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties.</p>
<p>I will further explain my views on Jing Hao, Guan Tong, Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Huang Quan, Wang Wei, Ni Zan, Wu Zhen, and from Dong Yuan to the Four Wangs: I believe Dong Yuan, Ju Ran, Huang Quan, Wang Wei, Wu Zhen, and the Four Wangs' Wang Shimin (Yan Ke), Wang Jian (Xiang Bi), Wang Hui (Lu Tai) are all one person. I have never seen them as several people from several eras. Jing Hao and Guan Tong, to Jiang Can, and Wang Yuanqi (Shi Gu) among the Four Wangs, are one main branch. Jing Hao and Guan Tong, to Ni Yunlin and Cha Shihbiao (Mei He) of the Xin'an School, are another separate branch. However, these two branches can also be combined into one person, without needing to separate them by time or person. Although the landscape painting in our Chinese painting has a history of over a thousand years from its beginning to its completion, upon investigating its overall trajectory, there has been no new discovery in any particular era; it has simply been a lineage of application and gradual improvement.</p>
<p>When everything reaches its peak, if it can further transcend its level, then it hangs suspended without support and can only fall. The four or five branches after the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty declined in one fell swoop for this reason. Thirty-five years ago, Lian Nanhu and others from my hometown were determined to find another path, so they advocated the "xieyi" (sketching ideas) style of Shi Tao, Shi Xi, Bada Shanren (Zhu Da), and Jin Nong (Dong Xin). The Civilization Book Company published many picture albums of these people, seeking to change the prevailing atmosphere. Wu Guandai from my hometown and Yu Yu from Shanghai did their best to imitate Shi Tao. Wu was better than Yu, sometimes even able to create forgeries. More than thirty years ago, I also liked the style of Shi Tao. Later, because this path could only be a form of "ink play," I resolved to study the theories and techniques of landscape painting from the Five Dynasties and Song dynasties.</p>
<p>People often say that the life of a calligraphy and painting artist must be pure and noble, and their reputation is very high; this comes from the integrity and self-respect of the ancients. Even when fame and fortune were clearly within reach, they refused to passively accept undeserved recognition. For example, Wu Zhen (Zhong Gui) vowed to "wait for five hundred years for people to judge." His dedication to moral character and hard work was like this. All those who succeeded in the past were like this. Look at the present! Alas! Furthermore, the ancients treated friends with utmost loyalty and trust, such as Wang Yuanqi (Shi Gu) and Yun Shouping (Nan Tian). When we read Yun Shouping's poetry collection, we often spontaneously feel a longing for the past. How can today be so inferior to the past? Today, at the Art Festival, I especially express this earnestly, hoping that my fellow artists will cherish each other even more!</p>
<h3>Painting Cattle</h3>

<h3>Universal Love and Aestheticism</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>Love is a drop of sweet dew in the soul, a cell in the nerve center, a ray of dawn in the darkness. It makes no distinction between the wise and the foolish, humans and animals. It comes with life, and only disappears when the body is destroyed; to gain it is to live, to lose it is to die. Religious people worship God because He created the entire universe and all things; in modern times, the mystical subjective thought has lost its scientific basis, and the power of love, perhaps, belongs to the realm of universal love. Sages, heroes, and righteous people love all things, love humanity, love the world, love truth; only with the spirit of universal love can they make great contributions and creations. Why are the great people of ancient and modern times so "foolishly" devoted? In a word, they belong to the nerve reaction of loving truth.</p>
<p>The definition of beauty is the perfection of form, the harmony of sound and rhythm, the pleasure of the senses. The creation of beauty is to take human imperfections, spiritual emptiness, and emotional agitation and depression, and expand, promote, and enrich them, arousing sympathy or admiration. Qu Yuan's "Li Sao," Li Bai's and Du Fu's poetry, the Wang brothers' calligraphy, the paintings of the elder and younger Li Generals, Phidias' sculptures, Beethoven's symphonies, the realm expressed by beauty belongs to the entire universe and life. Therefore, the fruits created by beauty grant favors to humanity, are not restricted by time and space, do not distinguish between race and country, and are eternally new, possessing eternal value.</p>
<p>The opposite of love is disgust, hatred, animosity; the opposite of beauty is ugliness, baseness, imperfection. Humans are the most intelligent of all things, and the highest virtues are truth, goodness, and beauty. Due to the extreme expansion of utilitarianism, human nature has deteriorated, creating world turmoil and human mutual killing, which continues to be staged on the stage of life, constituting the evil consequences of "going against the grain."</p>
<p>The spirit of universal love and the creation of aestheticism contain universality, impartiality, and selflessness. Beethoven's music is not limited to being received and appreciated only by the Germanic people; Michelangelo's sculptures are not exclusively for Italians to touch and admire; Li Bai's, Du Fu's, and Homer's poetry are not confined to being appreciated and savored only by the Chinese and Greek people. In November 1936, a Chinese art exhibition was held in London, which was extended to five months, shaking the world; the solemnity and splendor, magnificent and exquisite craftsmanship of Eastern art were deeply imprinted in the minds of Western people, because the appreciation and creation of art are not limited to race and country, its contribution belongs to all of humanity.</p>

<h3>Air Hostess</h3>
<p>— Jue Ren</p>
<p>"Air hostess," this beautiful noun, has been resounding recently. Unfortunately, they are merely "servants" serving the rich and powerful. China National Aviation Corporation strives for perfection in the facilities inside the aircraft, and does not want those who take the plane to be too lonely in the air, so it wants to recruit beautiful air hostesses to serve them.</p>
<p>The conditions are, firstly, to have a university degree; secondly, to be fluent in English and able to talk directly with British and Americans; thirdly, to be able to speak Cantonese; fourthly, to be able to speak Mandarin. And most importantly, one must be healthy, and not only healthy, but most importantly, one must have healthy beauty. This makes it difficult to be an "air hostess."</p>
<p>Being a female servant to the superior race and the upper-class Chinese is indeed so difficult. In addition, there is one more point to be stated: China's airplanes are not fixed and accidents happen at any time. Air hostesses must have the determination of "wanting money but not life," and be prepared to sacrifice themselves, so that those taking the plane will not be lonely even in case of emergency. Only then can the mission of the air hostess be considered complete.</p>
<p>Some are concerned that it may be difficult to find such an air hostess in China. Even if they can be found, they should use those prepared conditions to do something more meaningful. In fact, these are secondary problems. The biggest problem, according to a Central News Agency dispatch from New York on the 20th, is that China's largest Shanghai airport will lose its Far East aviation status due to lack of equipment.</p>
<p>If it becomes a reality, then even if I have many Chinese air hostesses, I can only send them abroad. Do "air hostesses" really want to go to foreign countries to be foreign maids? Alas!</p>
<h3>A Serious Joke</h3>
<p>— Er Bi</p>
<p>Time: March 20, 1947, Republic of China.</p>
<p>Location: Shanghai.</p>
<p>The price of a Shen Bao newspaper: 600 National Currency (postage extra for other locations).</p>
<p>A news item on the local Shanghai edition of the Shen Bao that day: The Lao Zha Police Station cracked down on a gambling den and arrested a large number of gamblers, including silk merchant Zhang Yinxian and 14 others. After investigation, the facts were confirmed, and each was fined 1,500 yuan before being released.</p>
<p>Let's do the math: 1,500 yuan is equal to the price of two and a half Shen Bao newspapers, which can buy three large steamed buns, or a bowl of Yangchun noodles, or seven and a half large pancakes, or a pack of not-so-good cigarettes.</p>
<p>Therefore, one of my friends wants to suggest to these fifteen silk merchants: If you want to gamble in the future, why not first pre-deposit a fine of 1,500 yuan per person at the Lao Zha Police Station?</p>
<p>Or: 1,500 yuan is indeed not a big deal now, but before the war, it could buy a small house. Therefore, the Lao Zha Police Station's move evokes a sense of nostalgia.</p>
<h3>Big Bills and Others</h3>
<p>— Lu Chen</p>
<p>After the issuance of the 5,000-yuan big bill, which was "neither denied nor acknowledged," it turned out to be a "printing oversight," and even the "numbers" were "greatly discrepant." One can represent the "continuous improvement of China's printing industry," and one can also see the "value of banknotes." If both of these "one in ten thousand" events are "rejected," I want to see what "appropriate punishment" the responsible party will receive?</p>
<p>With the discussion of currency system reform at the Third Plenary Session, Shanghai, which has the most thorough Jewish style, is speculating and discussing. But let me start with myself, these issues are all "armchair strategy." First, I myself am poor. Second, I borrow money to deal with daily necessities, and after three days, I am "poor" again. Third, I cannot produce myself, so of course the result is still "poor." With three "poor" words strung together, even if I "reform" and "reform" right in front of my eyes, it is not a way to save "poor."</p>
<p>Those who suffer from the "misfortune from the sky," even though they have issued a "list" with every detail, according to our "official business done officially" "official style," I can guarantee that it "must" go through the following: "review," "investigation," "seeking superior guidance," "granting approval," "approving for filing and record," "approving for implementation," and "due to" "based on this" "according to this" ... etc. Those who waste paper and ink "procedures" can receive "separate numbers" of 5,000-yuan big bill "compensation," that would be strange!</p>
<h3>To Greatly Shelter the Poor Scholars and Make Them All Happy —A Record of Zeng Wenzheng's Love for Talent (II)</h3>
<p>— Ai Ju</p>
<p>When Wenzheng conquered Nanjing, he was immediately appointed governor-general of Liangjiang. After the military affairs were roughly settled, he combined the printing bureaus of four provinces to jointly imitate and engrave the Seventeen Histories from the Jigu Pavilion, with the history of the two Han dynasties and the Three Kingdoms as the prerequisite. At that time, materials were needed for proofreading. My cousin also obtained a proofreading position by correctly guessing a riddle. My late father once recounted the story of Ge, a respected elder from Haining, which further showed that Wenzheng's love for talent was unwavering, even for humble individuals. Mr. Ge was an old student of my grandfather and had a reputation in the local school. His literary name was famous for a time. However, he suffered during the Taiping Rebellion, and his years were already advanced. He was good at humor, and his poems and essays were all written in a playful style, quite similar to Mr. Miao Lianxian of Renhe. He still set up a teaching account at home, but the fees were not generous, and his livelihood was very difficult. Because my late father was in the general's office, he mailed a newly printed collection of poems and asked someone in Hangzhou to seek a place to live, intending to present the poetry collection to Wenzheng as a recommendation. My late father, considering that each poem in the collection was interspersed with colloquial and vulgar language, and presenting it to his teacher might seem frivolous and lacking in solemnity, but because Wenzheng also liked such humor and usually regarded humor and wit as the highest level in discussing poetry, saying that it could not only relieve boredom and bring laughter but also develop intelligence and cultivate the mind, he placed the poetry collection on his desk and added a postscript on the cover. One day, Wenzheng visited my late father for business, and then took it away in his sleeve. The next day, he said to my late father, "How is Ge's energy? Can he come and work for me?" It turned out that he greatly appreciated two poems in the collection, "Monguan" (Schoolhouse) and "Xinhun" (Newlyweds), which he had secretly circled, and especially circled the last couplet of the "Xinhun" poem in red.</p>
<p>The "Monguan" poem says: "A gust of 　 cries out in the evening breeze, all the students show off their good voices, Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li, Zhou, Wu, Zheng, Heaven, Earth, Black, Yellow, Universe, Flood, after finishing the Thousand Character Classic, they turn to the Mirror of History, after finishing the Hundred Family Surnames, they manage the prodigy, among them is a outstanding one, reading the Great Collection three lines a day."</p>
<p>The "Xinhun" poem says: "Willing to be mandarin ducks, not envious of immortals, high burning red candles illuminate the splendid feast, indeed it is a previous connection, no need to be polite, so and so why so soon, so and so openly, tomorrow we will look at each other and laugh, we all know what's in our hearts!" Both poems are wonderful, and the last couplet of the "Xinhun" poem is truly worthy of 　Adu. The three hairs on the cheek, no wonder the Duke especially appreciated it. My late father replied that Mr. Ge was very energetic and could come and work. The Duke immediately approved and appointed him as the chief proofreader of the printing bureau. The bureau's salary was divided into three grades, the lowest being sixty gold, the middle being ten gold, and the highest being one hundred gold. Mr. Ge was fortunate to receive the highest salary, which can be said to be a lucky man. There are many scholars who are at the end of their road nowadays. Can there also be someone like Duke Wenzheng, who greatly shelters the poor scholars and makes them all happy?</p>
<h3>Art and Literary World</h3>
<p>— Feng Qian</p>
<p>Lei Shijian is the deputy editor of the Guoji Daily supplement in Kaohsiung, publishing many Chinese and Japanese poems. He recently published "Eight Years of Poetry Collection" and reprinted two Japanese poetry collections.</p>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian is in Taiwan, in addition to working as a director for the New China Theater Company, he is also devoted to the improvement of Min opera. However, since the "February 28th" incident, the Taiwan Provincial Chief Executive's Office Propaganda Committee was 　　disbanded. The New China Theater Company, which belongs to the Propaganda Committee, may break away from official relations and seek development in Taiwan. Ouyang may return to Shanghai once.</p>
<p>After the Taiwan Provincial Propaganda Committee was dismantled, the Taiwan Film Studio, which originally belonged to it, may become independent and make feature films to maintain expenses.</p>
<p>Taiwan is not short of talents in singing, dancing, and music trained by Japanese experts, most of whom were sent back to the province from Japan after the victory. However, after returning to the province, they immediately encountered unemployment. Dancers and musicians who were active on the Tokyo dance stage are now reduced to singing and dancing troupes that sell eroticism and abandon art, showing off low-level tastes to maintain their lives. The author once met such a woman in a coffee shop. According to her, she received six years of "baolei" training at the "Takarazuka" in Tokyo, but now she has become a female receptionist and cabaret girl in a coffee shop, and said very calmly: "China has no eastern guests, and no dance."</p>
<p>Film Talk</p>
<h3>"A Certain Madam"</h3>
<p>— Wei Han</p>
<p>The wife of a retired warlord, by chance, met her former lover from her days as an opera singer. On the surface, he is now a wealthy businessman returning from abroad, but in reality, he is engaged in the illegal manufacture and sale of counterfeit money. He seized on their past relationship and repeatedly blackmailed her. Finally, when the counterfeit money case was cracked, he forced her to flee with him, which led to the warlord discovering everything. As a result, the rogue was arrested by the police, and the madam, after publishing a "realization" manifesto, left her family. This is the story of "A Certain Madam."</p>
<p>Of course, we do not deny that a simple story can produce an excellent work with a good screenplay and a talented director. However, the film "A Certain Madam" that we can see is terribly disappointing. The emptiness and forced nature of the script forms an innate weakness, and the incompetence of the director creates a later disharmony. The entire story begins with an extremely sudden coincidence, followed by a patchwork of many forced and illogical fragments, and finally ends with a forcibly added "bright tail." On what basis is Hu Die's transformation, resistance, and epiphany based? Where will she go after she walks out of Yu's house? The screen does not tell us at all. I am afraid that even the screenwriter and the director himself have no words to explain. Also, how could Hong, the deputy officer, who has been a follower of commander Yu for twenty years, be like an impulsive young student, foolishly and clumsily professing his love to the commander's wife? We are really surprised by the screenwriter's and director's lack of observation and ignorance of social affairs in real life.</p>
<p>It is difficult to list all of this heap of forced, absurd, and illogical things in detail. The screenwriter created them with "closed doors," and the director moved them to the screen in the form of "comic strips." In addition, some annoying "gags" were forcibly added, such as "walking head-on into the wall."</p>
<p>Although Hu Die's acting skills are still promising, and the two actors who played the commander and the rogue are also promising talents, they were all ruined in this film. The sound recording skills were equally sloppy.</p>
<p>Regarding the production of "A Certain Madam," we cannot think of any better reason except that the company's producer thought of using this "old brand film queen" to speculate and make a fortune.</p>
<h3>The Children of Tojo and Konoe</h3>
<p>— 𣏌 Ren</p>
<p>Recently, American news agencies issued two news items. On the surface, these news items seemed unimportant, so many editors in newspaper offices who were busy dealing with news from the Moscow conference threw these two items lightly into the wastebasket.</p>
<p>These two news items are related to Japan. The first news item said that when the Japanese police were dispatched to arrest the gangsters across the country, they caught Tojo Hideki's younger brother in a corner of a train. After the war failed and Tojo was arrested, this younger brother of the unbridled prime minister had also been reduced to a gangster.</p>
<p>The second news item is: Konoe Fumimaro's son has gone to Moscow and is undergoing strict communist training!</p>
<p>The Japanese are a mentally abnormal nation. Their emotions fluctuate. They regard being able to commit suicide as brave, and they regard not hesitating to endure hardships until revenge is taken as the highest achievement in morality. In the shogunate era, it was very common for vassals to avenge their masters. After succeeding, they would generously commit harakiri. Moreover, when the stories were spread, countless heroic colors were added. In 1701 (Genroku 14), Oishi Kuranosuke and 46 other Ako retainers avenged their lord Asano Naganori by attacking and killing Asano's enemy, Kira Yoshinaka. All 47 committed suicide by disembowelment, and the Japanese still regard them as the models of samurai. I am not praising this "samurai spirit," I only want to call everyone's attention: a nation that has undergone such education for hundreds of years is bound to have a rather profound impact on the nation's psychology.</p>
<p>Therefore, we still cannot but be strictly prepared and closely watch the defeated Japan. Tojo's brother is reduced to a gangster, and the Japanese "gangster" is the "ronin" that we have long experienced. The Japanese ronin are organized. Their strength is much stronger than our country's gangs. The "Black Dragon Society" is an example. Don't forget that we have suffered a lot from the ronin before—wasn't the September 18th Incident launched by the ronin first?</p>
<p>Konoe's son went to be a communist, which has a more political "exile" air. Once this excuse is needed, it can be used at any time to take action. The more tense the diplomatic relations between the US and the Soviet Union seem to be, the more sinister his move is! Many Japanese still have more forgiving words for Konoe in their post-war writings, so in terms of appealing, this Konoe brand is really not worthless!</p>
<p>These two people symbolize the downfall of the rulers of Japan in the past, and also hide the hidden worries that we may encounter in the future. The Japanese are good at deceiving, and good at flattering with a forced smile—but, let me repeat one more sentence: The Japanese are a nation that regards being able to avenge their hatreds as the highest honor!</p>
<h3>"The Song of Bernadette"</h3>
<p>As one of the greatest productions of 20th Century Fox last year, it won five Golden Award statues from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences after its premiere. The heroine, Jennifer Jones, is a newcomer and was named "Best Actress of the Year." This film is her masterpiece. "The Song of Bernadette" is originally a best-selling novel by French modern writer Franz Werfel, and its story is already well-known in the United States. The film has now arrived in Shanghai and will soon be shown at the Cathay Theatre. Manhattan</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Do you think she's good-looking?" Old Xu understood the intentions of this playboy.</p>
<p>"Extremely beautiful!" Little Shen was mesmerized, his eyes shining. "It's just that she seems too arrogant..."</p>
<p>His words were not finished when a familiar whistle came from the courtyard, blowing a familiar tune.</p>
<p>"5111, 5271, 5144, 321712..."</p>
<p>"It's Old Zhu," the fat man put down his wine glass and shouted. He and 　the deputy manager turned around at the same time, looking at the door of the corridor.</p>
<p>Little Shen was displeased.</p>
<p>"Damn it, that monster! He's been singing the Wedding March for more than ten years, and he's still a bachelor!"</p>
<p>When Old Zhu's slender figure was gradually projected onto the wall of the corridor by the light in the room, Fat Xu opened his throat and shouted, "Come and have a glass of four-year-old UB! Old Zhu!"</p>
<p>But Old Zhu did not have time to answer. His body had just approached the door frame when a piercing long whistle of a steam whistle came from the sky, followed by a second and a third...</p>
<p>"Air raid! Air raid!" The people in the room shouted in unison, but their expressions were not nervous.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian's left leg had stepped into the door frame, and he smiled at everyone. Suddenly, a rush of footsteps came from behind him, mixed with the sharp voice of a woman.</p>
<p>"... First, we have to find Fei Fei. She doesn't know where she went, and the air raid is coming again..." 　　Lost her usual calmness, so anxious that her voice changed.</p>
<p>Jin Aili helplessly held Rong'er, following behind. She had lived in Guilin for a long time, so she was not afraid of air raids. This was because she had been greatly affected by Lan's 　　in the past few days, and had regarded her mother and her two children as her own. She was so anxious, she also became anxious, but she had never been assertive in her life. Although she wanted to help Lan, she didn't know what to do. Therefore, she could only 　　be in a group just like 　　herself.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhaonian did not hear clearly what they said.</p>
<p>"Don't panic! Air raids are nothing in Guilin. There are caves everywhere here. It's just a few steps out of the gate!" He wanted to comfort Lan.</p>
<p>"No, it's that Fei Fei is gone...!" 　said in a sad voice, her face pale with anxiety.</p>
<p>"What?" Zhu Zhaonian couldn't help but be taken aback, and quickly turned around. "Did she go out alone?" (II) (IV)</p>
<h3>Idle Chatter</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>Recently I had the opportunity to reread "Sun Tzu's Thirteen Chapters". This general, whom I once regarded as a martial figure, seems to be gradually revealing his true face in my understanding – a prudent, benevolent old man standing firmly in my impression.</p>
<p>The opening sentence says: "Warfare is of vital importance to the State; the province of life or death; the road to survival or ruin. It is mandatory that it be thoroughly studied." This is Sun Tzu's grand premise for discussing military strategy. He is earnestly admonishing us, his descendants, that the art of warfare is not a trivial pursuit for individuals to show off and compete for territory.</p>
<p>In the "Attack by Stratagem" chapter, Sun Tzu specifically proposes: "The best policy is to attack their plans; next is to disrupt their alliances; next is to attack their army; and the worst is to besiege walled cities." Attacking the army is already an unwise move, and besieging cities is the worst strategy. As for the key to victory, it lies in the upper and lower levels having the same desires. Translating this into modern language, it means that the government and the people must have the same needs.</p>
<p>We cannot flatten a floating face with a palm or iron ruler, and Parisian perfume need not necessarily be used in a funeral parlor.</p>
<p>The roar of wild beasts cannot cure people's headaches.</p>
<p>These are all common sense! Perhaps this thin textbook is printed too little, and many great people, except for elementary school students, have never read it.</p>
<p>An old man from the countryside came to Shanghai. I accompanied him on a stroll along the road. He nervously watched the cars and managed to cross the road with difficulty. He frowned and said:</p>
<p>"What? Are there so many people in Shanghai? Piles and piles of them, more than the flies on cow dung in the countryside!"</p>
<p>The country folk do not understand Bernard Shaw's satire; however, this is a wonderful metaphor, an intuitive metaphor, and I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>We also walked past an art supply company. In the glass display window was a plaster statue of Venus (the goddess of love and beauty) completely nude. The old man from the countryside shook his head:</p>
<p>"What? Isn't this woman wearing any pants? She's not ashamed."</p>
<p>If you were to talk to him about art and the beauty of curves, it would seem to be a waste of effort.</p>
<p>People in different positions can discover each other's absurdities.</p>
<p>Have you not seen that during the reign of Emperor Hui of Jin, many places suffered from famine? Emperor Hui smugly thought of a brilliant solution.</p>
<p>"If there is no rice to eat, eat pork."</p>
<p>I think that for those in Shanghai who don't have a house to live in, if they are afraid of being uncomfortable living in the Park Hotel, they might as well go to New York to live for a few years.</p>
<p>Merciful Lord! Do you want us to eat pork? Unfortunately, we don't have a good appetite, what do you say we should do? Amen!</p>
<h3>Japanese Meal – Moral Character – Fine Arts</h3>
<p>— Xu Shennian</p>
<p>Doing Good at the Art Festival.</p>
<p>"The writer is not a perfect person", therefore every time I sleep I dream, even when awake I am dreaming. Zhuang Zhou dreamed of transforming into a butterfly, fluttering and carefree, not knowing whether Zhuang Zhou had transformed into a butterfly or the butterfly had transformed into Zhuang Zhou? Xiao Erzi dreamed of becoming the president of the Central Bank, joyful, not knowing whether to buy US dollars or sell gold? Cui Zhen, the blonde girl next door, once told me in person: Butcher Kong made a fortune, three-wheeled vehicles in, three-wheeled vehicles out, his third concubine is even more fortunate, not caring about meals, playing mahjong, if Shanghai did not have electric lights, early in the morning when Butcher Kong slaughtered pigs, half-asleep, it would be difficult to avoid accidentally killing the third concubine, because her status and the pig's are equivalent; — I thought: Cui Zhen is dreaming, anyway, the blonde girls change at eighteen, she still has time to change! Xiao Ququ is good at dreaming, declaring in advance; especially the books I read often affect my dreams, for example: I read "Water Margin" during the day, and at night I dream of fighting tigers (live tigers); during the day I read a book by a certain doctor: "Flies are the great enemy of mankind", in my dream I clap and especially clap flies; in the evening I read "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio", in my dream I even traveled with the black and white impermanence!</p>
<p>At this moment, at this time, in this place, I had a rather elegant dream, which must be recorded.</p>
<p>In my dream, I was browsing the newspaper and accidentally discovered a huge advertisement: "Tea Party for the Art World", this is the main headline; the sub-headlines have two lines: "Regardless of faction, treat everyone equally", "Free participation, no invitation required". This is really tempting! I strolled over, — still in my dream, — as if I had arrived in that corner of Hongkou. Just as one of my feet was stepping into the venue, the master of ceremonies happened to shout: "Speech by the Minister of Art!" I thought to myself: Art with a Ministry, China has made great progress! The appearance of that Minister was very familiar, but I couldn't say who it was for a moment. The "speech" he gave was very humble, even saying that he was there to receive training, not to give a speech. Following this was the representative of the artists giving a reply. That reply was truly unexpected, — at least beyond "my" expectations. The person giving the reply first thanked the government for its care for the literary and artistic circles: not only did it ensure that they had no worries about food and clothing, but it also gave them great spiritual comfort, such as raising their status at the meeting, etc. Then he represented all the attendees in unanimously requesting the government to withdraw its subsidy policy, because in this prosperous age, — I continue to talk about my dream, — material subsidies are not needed. The presentation of this request was met with enthusiastic applause from the entire venue. The Minister of Art stood up with a smile and gave a long reply, which also won thunderous applause. His reply to the reply, in summary, has about three points: (1) In the past, everyone misunderstood that fine art was a luxury, but now it is clear that it is a spiritual key vitamin; (2) The country has a responsibility to protect all citizens, let alone literary and artistic people who are excellent citizens? (3) The literary and artistic people are willing to work hard and win glory for the country, the government is very grateful, all the subsidies are insignificant, truly what is called: "repaying one ten-thousandth," absolutely must not be mentioned again, mentioning it instead makes me feel ashamed! Then several other people gave speeches, all of which were very humble.</p>
<p>Finally, there was entertainment.</p>
<p>Among the various entertainment programs, the "Dragon and Phoenix Playing" performed by two masters was the most wonderful. Master A played the "Dragon", and Master B played the "Phoenix". Master B had Li Linfu's fat, but played Li Fengjie, the first county of this waitress, performing twisted and pinched, really killing people with laughter! Master A played the emperor, frowning, a little sour — but the most hilarious thing is that these two masters were originally mortal enemies, who had argued and even fought each other; today, on the stage, they shook hands and made peace, teasing each other!</p>
<p>Just as I was enjoying myself, a gust of wind moved, my eyelashes, startled me awake: it turned out that someone was testing an atomic bomb ten thousand and eight thousand miles away.</p>
<p>I look forward to the realization of this good dream; — the most important mission in life is "expectation" (36, 3, 19).</p>
