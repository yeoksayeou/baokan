<h3>汗流浹背迎魏使　首都奇熱七十年來未有</h3>
<p>— 本報記者兪振基</p>
<p>〔南京廿二日航訊〕魏德邁將軍三度來華的日子，正趕上南京七十年來未有的奇熱，室外溫度高到一百度以上，寒暑表上的紅綫還繼續往上漲，在大較塲機塲鵠候的歡迎者們，楚楚的衣衫，不知濕透了多少次。就是四點光景才趕到的宋子文，一下汽車亦立即將外衣脫去，雪白的襯衫，全部給汗水濕透了。最怪的是這末大熱天司徒大使還戴着一頂厚呢帽，汗直往下流，好些人都怕他老人家受不了。</p>
<p>原來說四點鐘到達的魏將軍，到五點廿分才到達，在機塲候得是久的人，快已等上三個多鐘點了。在魏氏沒有下機前，好些人都在猜魏氏今天穿什麼衣服，但很少人猜到他會穿平民服裝的，高高的身材，藍色的西裝，再配上紅紅的臉，尤其是一根「未來派」的領帶，從他風度看來，與其說他是著名的軍略家，還不如稱之爲外交家更爲合適一點。</p>
<p>魏將軍是去年四月才離開中國的，這次再蒞斯土，前後相距僅一年又三個月，舊整重遊，倍覺親切。下機後，第一個上前迎迓的是司徒大使，舊雨重逢，互道寒喧，眞有說不出的親切。攝影記者們乘這機會攝了好些鐘頭，接着由外交部凌其翰司長介紹魏氏與歡迎者一一相見，介紹到宋子文時，一握手，兩人同時從口中呌出「哈　」，魏氏第一次到重慶時、宋氏曾以外交部長身份相迎，其後過從極密，老友重逢，手握得緊緊的，魏氏並很親暱的稅：「好久不見，你好」，其後又介紹俞部長，白部長，陳總長，桂代總司令等，沒有一個不是老朋友，所以問候時都說：「又碰頭了，你好」，或「這次碰頭，非常高興」，再介紹孫立人等抗議名將時，好些人都曾與魏氏在滬西同事過，或在他麾下做過事，未握手先敬禮，到害得穿平民衣服的魏將軍不知還是還體好呢？還是還手好？有一位比較美國化些，爽性說：「OSBS，好久不見，你可好」，當然這其間亦有些新朋友，沈怡市長就是一個。</p>
<p>一一介紹過後，正進備檢閱儀仗隊，有一位洋攝影記者建議，要來幾個特寫鏡頭，於是請司徒大使與魏氏作懇談狀，魏氏與我政府官員並立合影，最後請魏氏與吳文官長握手合影，兩人面對着面，總得寒喧幾句，吳氏以幽默的語調說：「今天很熱」說得旁邊的人都笑了起來。</p>
<p>攝影記者感到滿足後，檢閱儀仗隊的儀式就開始了，當身材至少比儀仗隊中最高的一位尙高出一頭的魏氏從士兵面前走過時，我相信他一定想起當年在雲南練兵時的情景。</p>
<p>在大校塲上，我們曾迎送過不少人物，在這裏，我們曾迎過復員還都的高級政府人員，我們會迎送過馬歇爾特使，我們亦曾送過中共代表團。每一次迎或送，都代表着政治上一個階段的開始或結束。今天，我們又來接杜魯門總統的特使魏德邁將軍之來，表示着一個新時代的開始，我們恭祝魏氏此行成功。</p>

<p>〔本報徐州廿三日電〕魯西共匪已開始總退却，濟寗廿二日澈夜激戰，共匪攻城十二次，被殲八千餘，廿三日晨匪不支潰退，守軍跟蹤追殲，當收復城北三公里之戴莊·羊山集。國軍反擊續獲大捷，斃傷共匪五千餘，內有縱隊司令一人，參謀主任及參謀五十三人，汶上國軍廿二日又殲匪千餘。又主司令官耀武，廿三日赴泰安醫師，魯局已臨全般改觀前夕。</p>

<h3>美轉讓我國剩餘物資　總額近五億美元　華盛頓官方發表聲明</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿二日電〕美國對外淸算委會中國及東亞辦事處今稱：已供給中國之剩餘物資，共約一億七千萬美元，此與今年五月卅一日之報吿已有不同。國務院發言人解釋稱：該聲明係答覆葉公超之聲明者，蓋葉氏於六月四日曾稱：中國僅接獲二千萬美元之剩餘物資，其中大部份爲非軍用之卡車，官方之聲明稱：此項轉讓，係根據一九四六年八月卅日協定中所規定之大量出售條件而爲之者，目前之數字，乃代表該協定所規定之五億美元中之一部份。美政府在簽訂該協定以前，已以値價約三億二千四百萬美元之剩餘物資，依照成本，讓予中國。五億美元之物資，包括各種配備，內有卡車，建築配備，衣料，糧食，醫藥品，然飛機作戰物資，船隻及其他航海裝備俱不包括在內，此項物資即在中國本部以及太平洋中十七個島嶼（包括大琉球，關島），在五月底行政院物資供應局已獲五千九百七十萬美元之剩餘物資，由於運輸問題及各項辦法，中國方面接受該項物資之速度，　較淸算委員會通吿者爲遲緩，此項程序，早已確定，且大批物資早已轉讓中國，然目前此種轉讓速度大爲增加，依昭此項程序，轉讓手續，可望於協定所規定之廿二個月內完成。</p>

<h3>經濟改革方案全文（續昨日第二版）</h3>
<p>二，工業：非速建工業基礎，中國經濟不易健全，但中國經濟以晨業爲本，故非有自足之民生工業爲農業之保護，使農工業交流互齊，則中國經濟之基礎。不能確立，因此目前發展民生工業，應與基本工業兼奪並顧為急切之圖，故政府亟須改善工業球境，保障工業利潤，且使資金得有來源，貸款具有便利，同時訂立全盤計劃，並預定分年生產量，合政府與人民之力，分期完成之。其辦法：</p>

<h3>經濟改革方案全文　（上文接）（第一版）</h3>
<p>五·增產物資穩定物價：目前物資缺乏，物價波動，政府亟須以經濟方法增加生產，並妥爲運用，以達到穩定物價之目的。其辦法：</p>
<p>（一）政府宜透過農業生產貸款，就採定購方式，期能促進米·麥·棉·荳等主要農產原料之生產，並運用其一部份或大部。</p>
<p>（二）政府宜以原料供給廠商，或透過工業生產貸款，或採定購方式，期能促進麪粉·紗布·油糖·燃料及其他日用必需品之生產，並運用其一部成大部。</p>
<p>（三）政府宜透過輸出品貸款，或採定購方式，期能促進大豆·生絲·礦砂·桐油·毛革·茶葉·猪鬃等輸出品之生產與輸出，以充實外匯基金。</p>
<p>（四）政府得斟酌以民生日用必需品對官兵及公敎人員作有計劃之供應者外，有餘之物資，則應都市之需要，作配售及穩定物價之用，使圍積無法居，奇以達到安定民生之目的。</p>
<p>（五）政府應以優惠方式，向國外商洽機器及原料之借貸，以增加物資之供應。</p>
<p>（六）敵偽在國內工礦設備及由日本拆還賠償之工廠設備，除國營事業所必需使用者外，應儘量售予或租予具有能力與經騐之民營廠家經營，應儘速恢復並增加生產。</p>
<p>（七）規定利率之最高額超過規定之高利貸，不予保障，並懲罰之。</p>
<p>（八）依總動員法令嚴格取締投機操縱。</p>
<p>（丙）關於財政者</p>
<p>生產事業擴展，財政收入自可隨之比例增加，政府應以有效方法，保障並扶植農田生產，以裕田賦收入，保障並扶植工業生產，以裕直貨兩稅收入，保障並扶植貿易事業，以裕關稅收入，保障並扶植鹽業，以裕鹽稅收入，以全體人民之生產能力及其總收入，支持整個國家之財政。至財政上應行興革諸端，可納爲整理財政與穩定幣値二者，其詳細辦法。茲列舉於后：</p>
<p>一·整理財政：</p>
<p>（一）財政收支系統，應重予修訂，增加省級財源，期能自給，對於縣市法定稅課，並應切宣整理，嚴禁非法攤派，藉使地方財政健全發展，適應地方建設之需要。</p>
<p>（二）直·貨·關·鹽各稅稅率，應察酌人民納稅能力，切實調整，以增裕國庫收入，平均人民負担。</p>
<p>（三）依照有錢出錢之原則，增闢新稅捐，以應建國之需要。</p>
<p>（四）調整徵收機構，嚴密控制稅源，改進稽徵手續，以加强稅政效率，減低徵收費用。</p>
<p>（五）敵僞產業及剩餘物資，應迅適出售，其不須由政府經營之國營事業，並應以發行股票或其他方式讓售民營</p>
<p>（六）推行公債政策，吸收游資，以彌補財政收支之差額。</p>
<p>（七）優先准許人民，以黃金向中央銀行請購外匯，爲購買許可進口物品之用。</p>
<p>（八）以建國之需要，定機關之存廢，過份龐大之機構，必須緊縮；駢枝重複之機關，必須裁併。</p>
<p>（九）非國家迫切之需要及有利於生產建設之支出，必須節約停止。</p>
<p>二·穩定幣値：</p>
<p>（一）政府應積極增加收入，嚴格限制不必要之支出，使財政收支差額逐步減少，以節制發行之數量。</p>
<p>（二）以有效方法，延緩貨幣之週轉率。</p>
<p>（三）政府應有充分準備，並選擇適當時機，整理幣制，東北合灣新　各地區現行特殊幣制，亦應同時整理，以求劃一。</p>
<p>（四）加强管制外匯，吸收僑匯，以充實外匯基金。</p>
<p>（五）政府應准許人民以黃金爲購買政府出售國營生產事業及敵僞產業之用，以增加法幣之準備。</p>
<p>（六）國人在國外資產，應限期申報，妥籌利用。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>總之，生產事業不可一日無金融之滋養，財政收入亦不可一日失生產事業之支撑，金融政策，經濟政策，與財政政策三者互為因果，相濟相成，不可須臾或離。本方案所述，其已由政府施行尙未著效者，應由主管部會加强實施；其應立即實應，及進備實施者，應由行政院分交各主管部會妥擬詳細辦法，迅即施行。其次，爲本方案推行盡利，尤須注意者有三，一爲合理解決官兵公敎員工之待遇，使能維持最低必需之生活，俾行政效率得以提高。二爲國營企業與民營企業應立於同等地位，不使有所軒輊，尤不可使一部份私人企業，受特殊之待遇，致正當之民間事業增加困難。三為應在社會方面發動廣大之經濟建設運動，提高民間對經濟之了解與興趣，並以官民協作之力量，排除經濟建設之困難。以上各種革改措施，　能本此配合日進行，則現時之坐產萎頓，物價飛騰，稅源枯涸，收入失平之現象，立可改觀，庶幾生之者衆，食之者寡，爲之者疾，用之者舒，則財恒足，財政經濟之危機乃可以挽救矣。（完）</p>

<h3>社論　採行定貨制度平議</h3>
<p>—經濟改革方案檢討之一</p>
<p>關於增產與穩定物價事項，行政院經濟改革原方案，對於農業，工業，商業之促進，均有透過貸款或採定購方式等規定；而經委會之修正案，於此並無修改。此案一經國務會議通過，凡屬農工及輸出等業，均有大量地實施這採購方式的可能了。</p>
<p>所謂定購方式，其實施辦法，尙待分別擬訂，其意義與範圍如何，現在都無從捉摸。以意度之，當不外沿襲生絲，冰蛋的成例，指定機構，專司收購，其意義等於大批定貨，很可能地酌量預付貨款數成，以資周轉；不過範團較大，其成數或者可能較高罷了。採用此種方式，其優點有十：</p>
<p>一·所付款項，旣以實物交付爲條件，自不能任意移諸投機國積；</p>
<p>二·旣以實物交付爲條件，似乎確實可以促進生產；</p>
<p>三·在製造商先期拋貨，只須事前計算準確，亦並無何等吃虧之處；</p>
<p>四·因爲交付的是實物，而且是對方自己生產的出品，在定貨機關，並無意外風險；</p>
<p>五·可能因物價的上漲，而獲得意外的利益；</p>
<p>六·國家因此把握住大指物資，可以斟酌運用，穩定收價：</p>
<p>七·更可以利用這些物資，推行配給政策；</p>
<p>八·製造商旣經拋貨在先，對於銷貨方面，更可以免除滯銷或跌價等顧慮：</p>
<p>九·如屬於輸出品時，關於輸出時一切手續和損益，自可由承購機關担負，與出口商無涉；</p>
<p>十·假使約定就廠或就地交貨，則運輸，水腳，保險，上棧等勞費，製造商亦可以一槪不理。</p>
<p>以上十端，是專指定購方面的優點而言；其反面亦未嘗無缺點或可慮之處，試列舉如左：</p>
<p>照常理論；所謂定購的價格，自不能不採取協議的方式。總須一方願買，一方願賣；而後這筆買賣，方才可以順利成交。不過騐諸事例，凡是政府收購物資，常常有意無意地會帶幾分不甚合理的色彩；使生產者在某種情勢下，不得不委曲求全，以俯就其所開之條件。過去棉紗收購的價格，以及蠶繭，棉花等價格，都逃不出這個例子。因此辦理收購的人，亦常有力求公平合理，母使農民過於吃虧等呼聲。現在大規模地辦理各種定購，會不會因此過於抑勒，使生產者無從再生產？農民以無利可圖，寗可廣田自荒？此其一。</p>
<p>政府拋售物資，如黃金，紗布，糖，媒等，其價格往往追隨黑市，使人有頒導漲價的批評。如果以定購方式來收進大量物資，那麼，它所把握着的物資數量更多了，其經營的範圍，也更廣大了；其結果，到底是穩定物價呢？還是領導漲價呢？這也尙待事實來證明。此其二。</p>
<p>官辦事業，不能不講究種種手續；事情愈大，所兜的團子愈多，其躭擱亦愈重。過去有許多敵僞物資，救濟物資，就因爲這些綠故，弄到霉爛腐蛀，不堪再用。以彼例此，恐怕誰也不敢保瞪，以後斷不會蹈此覆轍。此其三。</p>
<p>所謂定購方式，恐不能不從大量生產和特種產品做起，那是限於技術上實力上的條件，確是無可如何的。假如定購方式，與其他方式（如現在各式各樣的貸款）同時舉辦，原沒有甚麼問題。倘或這方案實施以後，限制各種貸款，而偏重這定購一途，那麼，範圍較次的生產事業，和不在定購範圍內的各種產物，不免要受其影響了。上海市商會爲停止商業放款事，已電請行政院慎重考慮，勿予實施；可見其關係之重大。此其四</p>
<p>凡是大親模的收購，很容易造成壟斷的現象；使其他各方面，無法與之競爭或分潤。不久以前，我們曾聽到某種製油原料，內地許多小油廠，便已遇到此種難題。最近絲商方面，亦有保留兩成的請求，在這定購方式普徧推行以後，如何並籌兼顧，使在這些範圍以外的生產者不致受到種種不利的影響，這也是値得研究之事。此其五。</p>
<p>無論是原料，是成品，在達到零售商或消費者之前，其間必有許多中間商人。從中搬運，撮合，寄頓，集散，各盡其轉手的任務。雖然這些任務，大部份解釋為剝削，為漁利，為投機，囤積。不妨儘量予以淘汰，可是靠此爲生，與依此爲業的人，爲數卻也實在不少。在這失業衆多，生活因難的時候，以直接購銷的結果，平添了許多失業分子，使他們無業可營，這在整個的社會看來，也不能說是個嚴重問題，此其六。</p>
<p>最好虧的，還是大多數農民，因為他們的單位太小，產量有限，各種合作互助的組織，他們還是無法利用。修正案前言所云，目前各銀行之農貸，又爲數甚微，無濟於事，確係事實。所以就農產物論，所謂貸款定購等利益，在農民是無從沾潤的，此其七。　最後要談到定購的本身問題，卽是通貨供應問題了。有許多人以爲靠印刷機來籌款，要多少便是多少，似乎不須顧慮。其實印刷機亦自有事實上的限制，並不是予取予求，可以隨心所欲的。頗聞最近這一次收繭時，卽曾遇到這個嚴重問題，以至發生了許多麻煩，假如普徧採用定購方式，其所需要的現款，爲數自屬可觀。姑無論供應能否裕如，農，工，輸出各業，能否各取所需，各滿所願；但通貨繼續膨脹之後，物價能否穩定得下來？設或多所瞻顧，過於謹慎，則此定購方式，用以促進農，工，輸出各業的，其效果會不會大打折扣！此其八。</p>
<p>凡事有利必有弊，天下原沒盡如人意的算盤。這個方案，旣具有許多優點，而且幾經斟酌，只須國務會議一經通過，便可施行，我們自然盼望它順利推行，能收到增產物資與穩定物資的最大效用。不過預伏的隱憂，和前途的荊棘，要亦不可不審愼預防，早爲之備。譬如醫生用藥，其可能發生的反應，應在事前先行計及，並使它儘量減少到最小限度，庶不至發生意外，好在方案所定，還不過是個原則：究竟那幾種事業和物產，必須先行定購？其定購之限額如何？條件如何？定購以後作何處置？不準備定購的，如何兼顧？這些技術上的問題，我們相信：政府必有詳盡的考慮，和整套的計劃。因爲這是國家根本大計，與過去隨機應付的權宜辦法不同；決不會枝枝節節，「僅顧及一時困難之補救」；更不會專打小算盤，一味以盈虧損益爲前提的。</p>

<h3>管制日委會美蘇代表　辯論日土地改革政策</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿三日電〕蘇聯代表德里揚珂中將，廿三日攻擊日本土地改革案，充其量亦不過爲一不徹底之措施，甚至此項分配土地與農民之企圖亦遭阻碍。在廿三日晨之日本管制委員會開會時，德里揚珂與主席艾其森發生激辯，德里揚珂稱：根據事實數字所表現者，全部結果，由民主立場言之，皆屬不能滿意。渠攻擊日本農民在此項大達中，由於之故，皆放棄投票權。艾其森則毅然爲此政策辯護。蘇代表引用「東方經濟人」報上之數字，目的在表示日本原來之政策，擬將一百廿二萬五千英畝之土地，轉　爲農民所有，而至今尚無一畝之土地賣與農民。因此予不能承認改革業已順利實施。</p>
<p>艾其森令盟軍總部之農業專業休斯駁斥此項計劃失敗之攻擊。休斯指示，日本政府在七月二日，曾購進三十三萬六千英畝之土地，供再行分售與佃農之用。在三月卅一日前，早有三十一萬六千英畝　進。此外，並有六十五萬九千英畝、由政府徵購，代替稅收，可供分配於佃農之用。</p>

<h3>英艦隊訪問土國　不啻重申英土同盟</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社土耳其京城廿二日電〕關於英國海軍艦隊本日訪問土耳其領海一事，頃據此間消息靈通人士加以評論稱：此次訪問不啻重言申明英土同盟。按英土條約係於一九三九年所簽訂者，爲日下土國與外國間存在之唯一同盟條約，並未失去其效力或價值。英國艦隊來土訪問，純係普通之訪問，並不具有任何政治作用，土國邀請英國艦隊前來土國訪問，可被解釋爲上國目前雖在實際上依賴美國，但仍同樣效忠於英土同盟條約之謂。按訪間博斯普魯斯海峽之英國海軍艦隊歸英國地中海艦隊總司令威里斯海軍上將統率章。</p>

<h3>美國會擬組混合委會　赴歐洲調查經濟　美援歐經費或將超過廿三億元</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿二日電〕衆議院本日通過一項臨時動議，主張由參衆二院議員十九人組織一混合委員會，在國會休會期間前往歐洲調査各國之經濟情形。德境美軍佔領區及奧國，亦包括在內，並估計歐洲各國之所需，以實施馬歇爾國務卿之援歐計劃。其中有一部份代表為外交委員會委員·銀行家·金融家以及陸海軍要人。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿二日電〕據盛頓消息：美國依照馬歇爾計劃之對歐援助，或將超過廿三億美元，以一年爲期，計劃倘進行順利，將繼續撥款。惟杜魯門總統最近曾向國會表示，縱有援歐計劃，美國之出口明年仍有開始减少之虞。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿二日電）此間負責人士稱：巴黎經濟會議時所引起之重大爭執問題之一，乃抵帳問題。與會之十六個國家欲在短期內平衡其預算，極爲困難。在此種情形之下，一般均認爲德境英美合併區財政並無立即恢復穩定之必要。在歐洲各國尤其是英國無法平衡預算之時，給予她國巨大金融利益，不僅不公，且屬危險云。</p>

<p>〔路透社巴黎廿二日電〕華盛頓所傳美法將訂軍事間盟之說尚未能經巴黎方面證實。法外查部發言人謂於此未有所聞、亦未按獲國務院關於此事之　會。　並日關於報紙所傳召開英美法三國會議之說，亦無所知。</p>
<h3>美駐奧專員　責蘇軍綁架公民</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿二日電〕美駐奧高級專員開耶斯向陸軍部提出之報吿中、指斥在維也納街上有穿蘇軍制服者綁架公民。六月份在維也納市內如此失蹤者達十人，大多爲蘇聯控制國之國民，此事美軍官報雖未提及，然各報均有詳細之記載，並經可冀方面證實。高級專員之報告中又稱：盟國管制委員會原允許持有通行證者可穿越各佔領區之界綫，然蘇方乃不加說明而破壞此種協定，不准持有通行證者進入或離開蘇軍區，開耶斯相信蘇方此舉目的在防止政治難民逃入英美佔領區云。</p>

<h3>反對提高德工業水準　英法意見趨一致　皮杜爾諧法對德政策毫無變更</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿三日電〕此間消息靈通人士今日稱：美國或將保持其促成軍事同盟以防止將來德國侵略可能性之意向，但決非如華盛頓近日所傳之提議成立法美等邊絛約。本年十一月倫敦外長會議舉行時、美國或將再度提出四國安全條約問題，此際倘提出等邊條約或三角條約之議，將使四國條約之成功大受影響。抑有進者，法國不欲以大事增加德國工業生產之代價，以換取此種同盟。法國希望給予受德國侵略各國以恢復鋼鐵工業之優先權利。換言之，德國僅可留存最低眼度的鋼廠與鑄造廠。目前關於德國工業水準之搏鬥，英法似一致對付美國。英國外相貝文嘗謂：大事提高德國工業水進將危及安全。另一方面，美國衆議院外交委員會各代表則認爲此種恐懼並不適當，德國之工業乃歐洲復興所必要。但因法國態度堅決此一問題或將出以若干折衷辦法云。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿二日電〕法外長皮社爾今日吿上議院稱：法國對德政策仍無絲毫變更。按上院正討論以德境法軍區行政移交普通行政機構掌管之案。</p>

<h3>謹防日本經濟攻勢　邵毓麟論對日和約</h3>
<p>〔新亞社專訪〕日來對日和約，對日貿易等問題，己到迫臨眉睫之階段，本社記者特走訪日前由京來滬之我遠東問題權威，亞東協會常務理事邵毓麟氏，就對日和約之方針與態度，和約時期地點問題，賠償問題，對日貿易問題，日本債土問題，以及最近美國召開之對日和約初步協商會議等，叩詢意見。承邵氏暢談謂：余此次到滬後，曾與多數日本問題專家，如王芸生，徐逸樵，劉百閔，崔葛秋，孟憲章，宋越倫，李秋生，方秋　，趙南柔，劉覺農，周昌壽諸先生交換意見，茲綜合諸專家及余個人意見，逐題解答如下：對日和約之根本方針吾人認爲除以開羅宣言及波茨坦宣言爲基礎外，日本武裝必須澈底解除，使日再無侵略可能。政治上必須民主，而經濟上則須預防其爲害中國，爲害世界。軍事，政治，經濟，各問題中實以經濟問題爲最重要，蓋經濟力即作戰力，日本在盟國管制下’雖無發動軍事攻勢之可能，但其「經濟攻勢」之威脅，已面臨吾人。</p>
<p>賠賞問題若干人士僅注意如何描毀日本之重工業，而未能兼顧日本輕工業之可能的經濟攻勢。自我國立場言，技術落後之重工業設備究無補於現在及將來之經濟建設。為補救拆遷舊重工業設備與我並無實際利益起見，吾人似應另行提出現金賠償及生產品賠償之要求。若干生產品賠償之工廠亦應指定爲賠償物品，留待將來搬回，否則適足以增强日本之生產力。至於對日貿易問題，余同情停止開放對日貿易及停派商務代表之主張，但認為並非必要。後者僅在交換並蒐集貿易情報，其貿易行為必需通過我政府及麥帥總部。美國為减輕負担及日本爲維持最低生活，而開放日本對外貿易，故其開放勢在必行，為我民族工業及國外市場計，自應亦能積極設法予以誘導及限制，便如中日貿易方式，關稅制度，乃至輸出協定或諒解等，均應事前由政府會同民間妥商對策。輸出入業，民族工業，及消費者間之利害，政府自亦應，亦有權。予以通盤調整。談及日本領土問題時、邵氏主張「日本，爲日本人之日本」，意謂僅日本民族固有而非侵略所得者爲日本領土。琉球問題似可由中美兩國依照聯合國憲章規定，締結托管協定以處理之。邵氏最後復談及此次美國召開對日和約初步會商之程序及議事規程，謂由四國外長改爲遠東委員會或此次十一國會議，作對日和約起章之初步協商，余並不堅持反對。但若放葉我國之否決權而爲三分之二多數表法，在目前國際情勢下，及爲我國利害計，實應愼重考慮。余信常局必將有以善處。末謂余贊成美國及當局提早對日和約之時期，但若干盟國人士主張以東京爲和約地點一層，余及余之友人均一致反對云。</p>
<h3>日本野心益露骨　報紙一再發出「生存空間」呼聲　北海道議會要求蘇歸還三島嶼</h3>
<p>〔路透社東京廿三日電〕召開日本和約初步會議之建議宣布以後不數日，日本報紙，已發出要求生存空間之呼聲。讀賣新聞及英文日本時報先後刋載日企業家青木（Aoki）之文，述及日本國外土地之被「剝奪」，及七千五百萬人民之被雍塞於日本本土。作者於述及「中國事件」及「滿洲事變」後，指出戰前日本之領土，包括朝鮮，庫頁島南部，千島，列島，台灣琉球及南洋諸島，而當時日本人口猶不到六千五百萬。繼曰：日本今日匪特已被「剝奪」國外土地，其業已增加之人口，且不得不侷處於本土以內，而其生產能力，亦已不及前此之半。作者繼詢：日本現有之生產能力，將有如何之空隙可供出口？其所提出之解決辦法，則爲奮力工作。按此文旣兩次出現於日本報紙，意即兩次通過盟軍總部之新聞檢査，大部份英僑對於前述奮力工作之解決辦法建議，深感關切與不安，認爲係作者掩飾該文眞正目的之一種烟幕而已。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京廿三日電〕日本北海道議會，決定要求麥帥，將北海道東端海岸外，現由蘇軍佔領之三島，歸還日本。據該議會稱：此三島嶼，海產甚豐，如歸還日本，對於救濟糧食缺乏，將大有裨益。</p>

<h3>上海如何配合總動員令　市長在京獲得指示　昨謁主席後搭柯克專機飛返　市預算不敷中央決予貼補</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長奉蔣主席電召，於前晚乘夜快車晋京，謁見蔣主席後、業於昨日下午三時，搭乘柯克上將之私人飛機，飛返此間。司機來滬者、除柯克上將外、尚有市府交際科長張彼得等一行。專機於昨午三時五十分抵達江灣機塲。</p>
<p>市長下機後，逕返安福路官邸休息。據渠語記者：此行之目的，純爲報吿本市之物價情形，因渠進上次晉京時已逾一月，而主席對滬地生活狀况甚爲關懷也。據吳氏稱：主席對於總動員令頒佈後，上海應如何配合一點，已有所指示。至於外傳此次吳市長晋京，係與魏特邁特使來奉有關一點，吳氏昨已加以否認。對吳氏將出任駐美大使說，更斥爲無必稽。據稱：人事方面，絕對不至有任何更動云。</p>
<h3>田永謙閔湘帆　公畢返滬</h3>
<p>財政局長田永謙及市府會計處長閔湘帆，於上週聯袂赴京，向中央請准彌補市府三十六年度赤字預算案，業於昨晨公畢返滬。記者於昨日下午分訪田局長及閔處長，叩詢此行，結果，據稱：此次赴京，係應財政部電召，主要事項，在商討本市三十六年度預算問題。赴京後，首訪行政院會計處，並經常與財政部地方財政司接觸洽商。財政部原意，爲平衡本市收支預算計，擬將歲入部份，酌予核增，嗣經一再洽商，幸獲瞭解地方苦况。至此次晋京洽商結果，計其較重要者，約有四端：（一）中央原則上決對本市予以補助，此係一項撥補，以後如公務。待遇調整時，當可繼續請求。（二）營業稅應撥中央之三成，或可完全劃歸本市。據記者探悉：照預算數目，每年約可增加二百四十億元。</p>
<p>特種營業稅　七月起施行</p>
<p>（三）特種營業税起征日期，在原則上亦可接受財政局之原星，請改自七月一日起施行。此點田局長再三强調，並非爲爭取收入，完全係爲便利商民及改善稅制。（四）房捐條例，規定自用之房屋每人不超過一間者免捐，此項條文，亦可轉請修正。總之，中央對本市觀感，莫不認爲本市係財富集中之區，較其他地方請求補助爲難，惟經此次多方努力，結果尚未屬圓滿。</p>
<h3>產業工人兵役問題　總工會擬請緩征　解雇金問題亦成討論中心　今日召開理監聯席會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市總工會定今日下午四時召開第五屆第八次理監事聯席會議，據悉，今日會議所討論之中心問題，將有三件（一）產業工人兵役問題，總工會認爲在總動員令下，前綫兵源果屬緊要，然而後方生產亦不可忽視，擬請求緩征。（二）工人所得稅，前曾經當局准予免徵，近聞直接稅局又擬開徵，工界一致要求繼續豁免。（三）解雇問題，本市勞資評斷委員會議定服務在三年以上之工人被解雇，應由資方發給解雇金最多三個月，至少亦得半月，現聞市商會與工業協會向社會部請示，且言已得社會部覆示，確定解雇問題依照工廠法辦理，按工廠法規定解雇工人，但須於一月之前預先通知，並無解雇金之規定，因此工人認爲此問題甚嚴重，若照工廠法，則工人職業毫無保陣，且市社會局與總工會皆未接得此項法令，故今日會議中將詳加討論。</p>

<h3>張總裁新夫人　秘密抵滬　翩然下機羞避鏡頭　一陣烟幕登車而去　徐志摩夫人作伴同機飛來</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國行張總裁新夫人周碧霞女士，已於昨日午後五時三十五分乘空中霸王號飛抵龍華機塲。適張嘉璈氏因公赴京，故由張君勱之女公子以姪女身份代表歡迎新嬸母。國行高級人員多人，亦前往迎接，並照料一切。昨日張夫人之來，採取秘密方式，赴機塲迎接之親友，對此皆械口不言。及霸王機着陸後，乘客陸續走盡，但張夫人仍端坐不動。海關職員某君步入機艙面致賀意，張夫人亦笑而不語。頻問其隨行之友人謂：「有無拍照的在外面？」此時歡迎之親友，，在待機室外久候，亦面呈焦急之色，而不知新娘自有妙計，此時機上之女侍應生即對候立機傍之本報記者表示乘客均已下機，但一俟記者轉身走回待機室時，張夫人即自機上疾趨下梯，而與另一年長之女客同出。此目前成爲新聞材料之貴夫人，身御白底綠花旗抱，架太陽眼鏡，佩有照相機一隻，身材中等，豐腴而健碩，風度雍容華貴。當記者趨前攝影時，立即以摺扇遮面。與歡迎者匆匆握手後，不作寒暄，由歡迎者伴送出待機室，疾登預備之汽軍。本報記者再請攝影時，國行盧定中秘書在傍力阻，謂此乃「朱逸耕太太」，而非總裁夫人，於是汽車即疾駛而去。此時張府親友曁國行人員即在海關關卡為其辦理行李檢査手續，忙碌異常，約半小時始畢，而此貴夫人所帶之行李，均標有「大西路六十穴號周碧」等字樣之布條。歸納種種聞見，此所謂「朱太太」，實爲張嘉璈之新夫人無疑，晚間七時左右，國行盧秘書又來電話，强調此女客確爲「朱逸耕太太」，恐本報誤爲張夫人而發錯消息，特來關照。其關切之意，甚可感謝。但因過於熱心，反使人興「欲蓋彌彰」之感。至晚間八時三十分，本報接獲本報北平特派員專電，內容略謂：「周碧霞女士於午後一時乘霸王機飛滬，着白底錄花旗袍，圓臉，圓　，體胖，戴黑眼鏡，並帶紅色及白外套及照相機。徐太太（即張氏二妹徐志摩夫人）着灰大掛，較高，年約五十許，亦帶黑眼鏡同行」，與本報記者在龍華機塲所目覩者，完全相同，故國行總裁之新夫人，確已於昨日抵滬無疑，所謂「朱太太」者，不過一陣烟幕，當係深恐新夫人下機時爲新聞記者包園受窘，不得已而出此耳。</p>

<h3>文華招待新聞界　影劇名流　發表意見</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕文華影片公司爲「假鳳虛凰」糾紛事件，特於昨日招待新聞界，報吿經過情形。席間並由羅學濂，曹禺，歐陽予倩廢表意見數點。</p>
<p>羅學濂說：「這件事好比一隻燒餅，一個說甜的，一個說苦的，問題很簡單，祗要打開來嚐一嚐就可知道了」。</p>
<p>「我認爲文華當局決沒有侮辱的意思。但是反過來搭理髪業全體會員想一想，在沒有明白眞相之前，響應反對這件事，亦不能說不合理，不過這小小的誤會，如果打開燒餅嚐一嚐，相信是不難解決的」。</p>
<p>「在故事的結構上，免不了有人物，有職業，有區域，有穿插。尤其在喜劇中，笑，閙，和幽默，更是必須有的條件，所以不能曲解。這裏有侮辱的意思」。</p>
<p>曹禺說：「我認爲最應該抗議的，應該是那個混帳的經理。其實最善良的，正是那側三號理髮師。最後，他不但是最善良的，而且亦是最勇敢的」。</p>
<p>「在意織上看：全片充滿了輕　的感覺。結尾的處理，尤其覺得可愛，在不喊口號的方式下，却用了覺悟的方式，一脚把壞蛋踢了開去」。</p>
<p>歐陽予倩說：「與其說是諷刺理髮師，毋寗說是諷刺某一種不合理的企業公司總經理，這故事用喜　來表現，處理得很滿意」。</p>
<p>「如果在結尾中，理髮師依賴了女人坐了汽車，住了洋房，這才是眞正的侮辱。而現在三號終於放棄了虛僞，在自食其力的情形下，結束了這一個故事，似乎不應該再有誤解的成份亦在」。</p>

<p>〔大華社訊〕近日出版界發生國定課本新觀本問題，一時撲朔迷離，莫名究竟，記者特爲此事，走詢自戰時以來，曾在後方產加國定本編印工作至今未輟者，得悉國定本初刋本出版於太平洋戰爭之初，命名爲「暫行本」，旋經邀集各專家迭次商酌，改編爲「標準本」，復員之初，復彙集各方批評意見，改編爲「修正本」，每次印行前，均由國立編譯館派員校對，匆遽之間，難免略有失校之處，此非出版界所能負責，惟編譯館根據年前初版修正本製成之刋誤表，七聯處谷家今年春後出版書籍，早已校正。前七聯處正中，商務，中華，世界，大東，開明，文通，兒童，中國文化，獨立勝利等十一家之版本，曾依據數種補遺刋誤表，再爲一一改正，市肆間近以新修正本「出版預吿」，企圖吸收現金者，實際上其版本在出版前即已成爲舊本。最近國定本內容，並無重要修正，坊間所謂新舊修正本，乃生意眼中之宣傳文字，事實上不過少數失校錯字之改正，倘強以新舊辨別，則最新修正本出版者，仍爲正中，商務，中華等十一家，因該十一家均照部定最近修正，中小學各科俱備，供應無缺。</p>
<p>〔另訊〕據某敎育家談：在原子時代，中國一切落伍，而名爲培養下一代之國定本敎科書連原子二字還未編入，內容之陳腐，幾等於三字經等古代課本，應即立予全部廢止，重行改編，將新時代新材料，盡量採集，予學生以最新之知識。此有關國家培養人才之基本條件，萬不能數衍了事，得過且過，始終走向「落伍」之途徑云。</p>

<p>賑災網球賽：（上）葉觀雄卡遜賽畢握手（中國社攝）（下）黃紹竑與購買義球之金汝　合影（本報攝）</p>
<h3>盛大賑災綱球賽　葉觀雄和卡遜　綱球拍義賣二千五百萬元</h3>
<p>救濟兩廣水災，白部長黃副院長黃省主席等發起，由績球委會主辦之網球義賽，於昨日下午五時，在中正南一路綠燈網球會球塲舉行，網委會特邀請最近自港來滬之港冠軍葉觀雄參加，與本市冠軍卡遜，作單打表演賽，南北兩雄會面，爲不易得之盛事，益以事屬善舉，故昨日冒著到塲參觀者，近一千人，情况殊爲熱烈。比賽中途拍賣義球四隻，由振泰體育會金汝煊以一千五百萬元購得，嗣又拍賣葉觀雄之網拍，結果由係華建築公司車炳榮以一千萬元購買，熟忱可佩，並由黃副院長分別頒給各表演球員獎牌一方。</p>
<p>黃紹竑詞五時正，首由黃副院長紹竑致詞，略謂：兩廣水災嚴重，本人等與上海市體育界發起舉辦網球義賽，蒙各界人士到塲參觀，本人代表兩廣災民向各界致謝等語，旋即開始比賽。三塲結果如下：</p>
<p>（一）葉觀雄和卡遜（單打）三—六·六三·七—七—。</p>
<p>（二）謝兆良李國瑤勝陳亦余田光（雙打）六—三。</p>
<p>（三）葉觀雄王文正勝卡遜史規亞（雙打）六—二·六三。</p>
<p>葉卡爭雄裁判胡憲生，卡遜首先法球，即勝，於是各得發球局，直至各三後，卡遜連下三局，以六—三勝第一盤。第二盤葉觀雄苦心應戰，連取三局，卡遜反攻，被扳成各三平手，葉氏再度努力，亦以六—三三奪回一盤。最後一盤中，雙方競爭更見劇烈，葉觀雄始終佔先，成五比三之局勢。卡遜連得三局以六比五超出，葉觀雄再度迫成平等，且以七比六佔先，旋又爲卡遜扳成各七。時陰雲密佈，若將大雨，經主辦當局宣佈，作爲和局結束。</p>
<p>雙打比賽稍頃濃雲漸散，雙打繼續舉行，首由謝兆良李國璠組與陳亦余田光組對壘，因時間已晏，以一盤爲止，結果謝李組以六比三勝。壓軸雙打葉觀雄王文正組與卡遜史規亞組登塲，開賽時，天已將暗，史規亞年事較高，眼力不濟，卡遜不得不大厦獨支，葉王乘機直入，結果以六比二，六比三勝卡遜史規亞。</p>
<p>葉君表演國人期望甚股，對於葉觀雄之球藝，大爲注意，姿勢擊法，均甚佳美，上網攔殺，尤有獨得，抽擊亦多妙作，開球稍形軟弱。卡遜昨日似未達正常狀態，壓殺觸綱及發球雙錯誤，一見再見，葉君尚未能如卡遜之稽健有把握，惟以二十二齡之靑年，有此成績，已屬不易，前途正未可限量也。</p>

<h3>工商團體紛起探討　對日貿易開放問題　加强管制雖可限制日貨傾銷　夾帶走私流弊亦不可以忽視</h3>
<p>日本對外貿易，自麥帥總部批准之後，我國當局亦正對技術問題，以及派遣商務代表赴日，加以考慮，全國人民莫不深切注意。上海國貨工廠及全體工友鑒於日貨侵入，必影響於民族工業，上海機製國貨工廠聯合會，特於前日（二十二日）召集會議，出席當務理事任　道洪念　胡西園胡伯經顧克明王家珍等，推胡伯翔為主席。經詳細商討，各理事一致熱烈反對，除發表宣言，請救中界同情　援外，並呈　國民政府行政院經濟部，迅即停止考慮，並中止派遣代表赴日。略謂獨立國家，匯有自主之初易政策，決不能因國際關係，而放棄主動地位，現和平條約，迄未訂立，戰爭損失，尚須賠償，距離通商時期尚早。且戰後人民喘息未定，離受經濟侵略之榨取，工廠奮勉圖存，更不能再受外貨侵入之摧殘。若言原料不足，則物物交換，早已施行。在中日兩國未恢復正當狀態之下，實無另闢民間貿易之需要。日貨輸出南洋，我國貨之海外巿塲，將被佔奪，今更加以侵入國內，吾民族工業必受摧殘，所有復興工作，將盡付諸　水。故此次　日貿易之開放，於國於民，有百害而無一利，實無考慮之價値云云。</p>
<h3>全國工協　今日開會</h3>
<p>為商討反對日貨來華傾銷，中國全國工業協會特定於廿四日在京舉行理監事會謶，該會上海方面之理監事吳蘊初，胡件翔，榮鴻元，田和卿，唐承宗，陶桂林等一行，於昨晚乘夜車晉京，各地工業協會理監事亦將蒞臨南京，出席該會。除全體理監事外，並邀請各省工業協會理事長參加，該會理事田和卿於行前語記者稱：若干不明實際情勢之人士，以為日貨來華，依照國家經濟政策，不致在華傾銷。殊不知廉價貨物之輸入，猶如水銀瀉地，無家不入。走私與夾帶齊一，去年吾國貨工廠受廉價美貨之輸入，損失之鉅，幾無法統計。况現今之日貨價格，較美貨尤為低廉。又據全國工業協會常務理事胡伯翔氏告稱，凡國貨製造廠家，對日貨之輸華，無不堅決反對者，希望有此願望之人士，改變其初衷。</p>
<p>又據記者探悉，巿商會上海巿工業協會，中國生產促進會，上海機製國貨工廠聯合會及各工業同業公會將聯合商討關於反對日貨銷華問題云。</p>
<h3>輸管解釋　利害關係</h3>
<p>據輸管會負責人解釋稱，若就純經濟立塲而瀹，我國可以對日開放貿易，因我國需要日本大批工業原料，我國向國外訂購各種物資，均需外匯，訂購日本物資無異於訂購美國物資。但美國此次開放對日貿易，當然對美本身有極大裨益，若我國對日開放貿易，因我國工業不及日本發達，故　我國有害無益。在此情形下，我國必須加强管制辦法，對無益於我國建設之物資，一槪不准輸入。再就實際情形預測中日貿易開放後，成交之數字定少，因中國有輸入會之嚴厲管制，日本有盟軍之聯合管制，日本決無法將大批賤貨物資傾銷來華。工業協會所　　者，輸管會亦已考慮到。輸管會決不令日本有大批物資運華而摧殘我國工業云。</p>
<h3>中信副局長談　顧慮大可不必</h3>
<p>對於開放日本對外貿易一右，各方意分歧，有主暫緩實行，亦有表示不必担憂者，各據理由，菲衷一是，記者今特為此走訪中央信託局副局長羅吟　氏，請其表示意見，據羅氏稱，關於此一問題，各方均表示憂慮。在被個人言，誠屬不解。開放日本對外貿易，對我國工商業固不一定有益，但吾人要知，日本雖為一戰敗國，終不能永遠禁止其對外貿易。明瞭此點，則我人此項顧慮，大可不必。至於有人担心日本貿易，一旦開放後，大量日貨可能來華傾銷一節。僅須我對輸入管制政策，嚴格實施，即無問題。記者繼詢以開放日本對外貿易後，與我政府現行之對日易貨政策，是否抵觸。羅氏謂，易貨政策，係政府與政府之間所進行，與一般普通貿易，性質殊異。且目前所進行之易貨政策，　日本運來之貨物，事前均經我政府指定，均係必需貨品。故今後對日貿易正式開放後，易貨政策並行不悖，毫無妨害云。</p>
<h3>銀根鬆暗息小　華股維持盤局</h3>
<p>華股昨復告下游，業中大戶居空者多，乘高壓力瀕仍報載日絲出口等訊，又起不利於美亞之看法。前日補空份子，乘高覆出，脆弱之股巿，終告被迫屈伏。一任空頭橫行，浮多低首稱降，中途十分怯疲，午刻始由銀根十分鬆濫，暗息賤至一角左右，尚無受主之助，略有彈性，而以盤局結束。</p>
<p>晨開見高，開後遞美亞二三一號一七一號買進，一四二號二二三號一八五號二四號九四號一四號一四三號脫手，尤以二二三號之出籠不已，將現遞美亞迫低至四九〇元，一五一號一八六號二一九號趁低雖進，回升欠勁，仍由二二三號一三四號三六號三五號再賣，一四號並售出現美亞，於是遞美亞再低至四七三元。九時四十五分後，四〇號八號二三一號四二號一五二號趁低進至四八四元，二三五號三六號八五號二四號二三二號六五號一四九號再來了結，麗安由二四號在十時十分首先掛低至跌停限度，美亞乃跌至四六〇元低價。現遞至此。業已軋平。信和由一六〇號三五號二三五號一六三號一八一號賣出，迫低至二八〇〇元及二八二〇元。新光呂班路門巿部三樓有失愼之說二一八號以及散戶均賣，即交會低至一六二元，遞交一六三元低價，景福同時被壓小至一四三元之光景，一六〇號二三七號一三七分號一六三號買進，十一時十五分美亞回升四八〇元，八四號六九號一七九號一〇四號四號賣出，復低至四六八元。一五七號二三二號八號買進，銀根大鬆，暗息賤至一角左右，人心略為振作，美亞回漲到四八五元。八四號一九七號進漲信和，一五二號略納現信和，於十二時後，於高至三〇三〇元左右。二一九號七六號一一七號九七號六〇號仍來壓迫，一〇六號八五號並售現美亞，臨收前再低至四七〇元內。信和亦由一五七號一三三號了結，低至二九〇〇元左右，而以盤局結束，收後遞美亞由二二三號一六〇號二三一號買進，空主有補，喊高至四七五元左右。結果較前收計即交股新光信和勤興新華所跌不多，美亞華　中法永公各低半成，內衣大通榮豐火柴水泥景綸平平，新亞中紡統益各跌半成光景，麗安跌停後有回，軋低二成不到，餘股微降。遲六股計新光信和微挫，景福華豐美亞永公各跌半成。塲外各老股世界中華閘北華商俱跌半成，餘股亦見平疲。</p>
<h3>永紗新股上巿　單位暫定五萬股</h3>
<p>塲外永紗殘價，開巿一九四元至一九七元，低價一七三元至一七六元，最後一八九元至一九二元。息價一角六半至二角一，小型股為一角二云南一角六分半。昨日證六發出公告稱：永安紡織股份有限公司本年七月二十三日函報增資，已告完成，該公司之新股，定於七月二十四日（星期四）起開做，成交單位暫定為五萬股云。</p>
<h3>統債回升　外股轉穩</h3>
<p>公債昨見回振，統丙晨開七〇〇〇元，二〇三室五三八室賣到六八〇〇元，五五〇室五五五室五〇三室俱納，錢兌業亦有吸收，銀根見鬆，步升七八〇〇元以上，結果較前收計甲乙戊各升七〇〇元，統丁漲六〇〇元，統丙好一〇〇元，成交約二百餘萬</p>
<p>外股昨浮沉不一，過程由　漸穩。除祥　不行得清理消息下，　由三六〇〇〇元扳高至　二〇〇元收巿，且屬求過於供。怡　亦自六二八〇〇元步升至六六〇〇〇元結束，洋行帮廣帮俱進，證券帮錢兌業則出。結果較前收計紙業業廣平平，鋼業怡紗微降，餘股均告微升。</p>

<h3>金融管制事宜　持久始能收效</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政部為配合總動員令，擬定加强金融管制辦法三項，一控制金融巿塲，二加强管理銀錢行莊，三取締投機買賣。記者特持以徵詢中央銀行稽核處處長李立　意見，據談：關於金融之管制事宜，須經常執行，持之有恒，則收效尤大。此次財部擬定新管制綱領，將使金融之秋制，益趨具體化。渠認為目前管制金融之重心，主要係在取締黑巿金鈔及外匯。財部與本處近來經常對各行莊採取抽查工作，主要目的，仍在積極扶助各行莊上錢業務正軌，絕非消極性予以打擊云。</p>
<h3>張耀章由印度返滬　談印棉產銷狀况　產量漸已非我國重要巿塲</h3>
<p>我國企業公司在印度設立分公司者，以人人企業公司為第一家。該公司業務部經理張耀章氏，去歲十一月赴猛買，　分公司，在印歷時八月，曾遊歷權里加爾加答等大都，攷察印度棉業巿塲，於最近返國。張氏談稱：第二次世界大戰以前，印度棉花產量平均每年約六百萬包，太平洋戰事發生後，因集中力量增產糧食，棉花產量大减，故一九四一年可謂印度棉產之轉捩點。一九四二年减少至四百七十萬包，一九四三年後增加至五百二十六萬包，一九四四年减為三百五十萬包，一九四五及一九四六年僅有三百四十萬包。戰前印棉最大主顧為日本，每年輸入約一百六十萬包至兩百萬包，次為中國，一九三〇年印棉輸華頂高額為一百六十萬包。以後因我國棉花增產，輸入逐年减少。七七事變前，印棉輸華數量徵不足道，上海淪陷後，又稍有起色，增至七十五萬包。嗣後因海運斷絕，又告中斷。去年印棉輸華為四十五萬包，佔金印出口額三分之一。今年我國已非印棉理想巿塲。日本因在麥帥統制之下，紡織原料全賴美國供給，故目前印棉銷路僅有歐洲西班牙，比利時捷克等小國，銷數極微。現孟買一地存棉有一百五十萬包，印政府為維持議價，防止棉業危機，已自動收購十九萬包，六月底開始，政府更取消　　出口管制條例，藉此刺激棉價。印度輸入管制極嚴，華絲在印銷　甚窄。我國　物品，以　　為六宗，尤以綠豆為最多。次為工業出品，如熱水瓶綱針等。但以成本較高，銷售頗感困難。張氏對印度觀感甚多，並謂吾等不　再歧視印度，此種不正確之觀點，應予改去。因目前印度輕重工業，均較我國具有規模，進出口貿易，亦比中國為大云。</p>
<h3>輸廣會派員視察　川粵生絲實况</h3>

<h3>邵陽示範廠　看農村工業幼苗的生長</h3>
<p>— 衡陽十八日航訊　本報範者黃潮如</p>
<p>中國　該工業化，是時下救國論者一致公認的，可是我們是個以農立國的農業國家，農民占全國人口百分之八十，工業救國固天經地義，但亦不能忽視了農村，應該致力於鄉村工業化，把工業基礎建築在農村。否則，徒沉浸幻想於都巿工業的發達，以為救國　　，是舍本逐末，輕重倒置，最後必離期理想的收穫的。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利後，行總成立，其工作對象除消極的救濟難免外，同時致力於復員善後建設，尤其是廣大的刦後農村之重　　。所以三十四年多，行總前署長蔣廷黻先生與聯總鄉村工業主持人克萊蒙（Mr．Clemont）商討，決定在行總組織下，設立一建設性之機構，聯總尤撥助大批器材，及派遣技術人員來華共同合作，對地方性的小型工業，協助其復員，並建立示範工廠，以作建設鄉村工業的試騐，逐漸推廣，以引導落伍的農村，漸趨工業化，步入科學的領域。</p>
<p>三十五年五月一日，鄉村工業示範組組織規程經奉批准，行總派專家蔣光會博士會同聯總專家實地考察，擇定了湖南邵陽與廣東曲江兩地為第一期工作地區。邵陽區就在是年開始，組本部於五月正式成立。</p>
<p>組本部成立後，即着手徵購地基，建立廠房，運輸器材；同時為配合外籍工程師，特呈准設立技術訓練班，培植幹部，預備他日推廣工作，計第一期招考大學理工學院畢業生十四名，高中學生六我，第二期招收高中學生十二名，分別派隨外籌工程師學習，並就邵陽，曲江兩地隣近地區之資源，交通及原有小工業生產情况作詳確之調查，俾作將來工作推進之參考。同年十一月，外廠工程師相繼抵邵，建廠工程，於為開始。</p>
<p>最先成的母廠　機械廠一瞥</p>
<p>本年二月，最先完成的是機械廠，廠址設邵陽汽車東站附近之　本部。該廠是專生產各廠必需　機械，以供各廠之需，所以可　為　廠。聯總配給的機械及器材，於三十五年九月即源源運到，先在組本部前坪搭蓋一臨時工塲，迨本年二月廠屋落成，設備增加，始告正式成立。</p>
<p>該廠有動國問一所，裝置有十五　發電機及三十　發電機各二部，供給組本部電燈及全廠動力。機器同計大小車床四部，刨床銑床各一，擊機四，其餘如交直流電動機，空氣壓縮機，汕壓機，電動磨洗器等數十餘種，雖係小型工具，但皆美國戰時最標準機器，應用旣廣，施工亦便。現正計劃擴大範圍，擬增添龍頭刨床及萬能釬床各一部。又翻砂間原用五百磅熔鐵爐一座，現以產量不敷，擬增設一噸熔爐一座。小模間亦計劃擴展中。</p>
<p>該廠專為供應各廠機械，所以業務是純對內的，現在為了擴張對外業務，擬代表各民營工廠修配機件，並大量制造碾米，榨油等機，以供鄉村農民之需。</p>
<p>水泥·硫酸·肥料　三廠已完成</p>
<p>水泥·硫酸·肥料三廠已於本年度相繼完成。</p>
<p>三廠在的水泥廠，設在僅用小型生產方法，其設備計有：（一）5×5臥式大管鍋爐一座；（二）25HP蒸汽引擎一座；（三）15KVA發當機一座；（四）　式碎石機一座；（五）球磨一座；（六）混合機一座；（七）鼔風機一座；（八）水泥直窯一座。</p>
<p>水泥原料是取自該廠附近的石灰石，其中氯化鈣含量最　，氯化鎂及硫化物均極輕微。又附近的黏土，矽　及氯化鐵含量亦豐，堪稱水泥之上等原料。該廠因為成立不久，目前產量尚不能供應邵陽巿塲的需要。現在正籌添裝一百匹馬力鍋爐及引擎，並增加直窯及碾磨設備，期達到每日生產一百袋（每袋約巿稱一百斤）之目標。</p>
<p>硫酸廠設在東門外五台山，該廠由美籍工程師葛德烈（Mr．Caricoporez）主持設計，葛氏曾參加美國陸軍部鄉村工業部門在南美的試騐工作，所以經騐豐富。該廠係將用鋁室法，為最經濟的小型硫酸廠。其唯一重要材料為鉛皮，各種裝備在在需此。但湘省的青鉛，戰後產量極少，經多方設法，始在湖南煉鉛廠購得十噸，復託衡陽永生化工廠，代壓成片，以供應用。所需用的耐酸磗，則係採用零陵中國籌業公司出產的耐火磗代替，尚稱合用。</p>
<p>該廠裝置：（一）烯磺爐一座，共計爐腔三個，係硫磺，鐵磺兩用式，在開工之始，僅啓用烯磺爐一個；（二）除塵室一間，容積二〇立方尺；（二）脫硝塔一座，容積三七·五立方尺；（四）鉛室五座，每座容積用支索撐住四立方尺，冷却面積為一六〇平方尺；（五）吸硝塔三座，每座容積二十五立方尺；（六）壓酸器（酸蛋）三具；（七）小型蒸汽鍋爐一座；（八）空氣壓縮機一座；（九）烟突一座。除上述各項外，他如受酸池，給水裝置，起水機，發電機，電燈，電話，以及測量儀器用具，均配置齊全，足供應用。刻因煉焦尚未開工，所以所製成的硫酸，正計劃提濃，暫供巿塲需要，此項設備，本月底前可以完工。</p>
<p>原料來源原係取給於常寗水口山的硫磺，惜該處供應不暢，價亦過昂，已計劃改用硫鐵磺作原料，以期减低成本。此項礦質，邵陽境內產量無多，且含硫成份不高，頗難合用。近在湘鄉購到一批，試用結果，尚稱圓滿，所以將來的原料取給，大槪是以湘鄉為大宗了。</p>
<p>目前產量，每日約可達一千磅左右，按巿價計算約値四百萬元，不日可以增產至二千磅。銷路現亦僅供給邵陽巿塲汪量需要，餘則留作自用。現各方訂貨者甚多，頗有（難於應付）之勢。</p>
<p>肥料廠設在邵水西岸的上牆。該廠於本年一月間聯總派衛生工捏師史通（Mr．R，Stone）至邵，即開始工作，四月底完成肥料部工程，五月底完成邵巿公共厕所十所，六月底完成飲用給水工程一部份。</p>
<p>訪廠採用之肥料，用連續作業發酵法。其發酵時間，夏季約二十日，冬季約四十日。在此發酵期內，因溫度甚高，且水份逐漸减少，原存於糞便中的痢疾，霍亂，傷寒等病菌及寄生虫，如迴虫，　虫等，均大部死亡。如此可减少疾病之傳播，再則此等肥料之發酵，皆於密室中行之，故含氣物之損失亦少，且其中加入適量之骨粉及稻草，則植物所需而又為糞便中獨缺乏之磷鈣原棄，因之增加，此較我國舊法堆肥為優多多矣。</p>
<p>該廠設置，計有（一）沉　池二，容量一千五百加侖；（二）化糞池二，容量四千五百加侖；（三）消糞池六，容量一萬三千八百加侖；（四）單獨化糞池二，容量一萬四千六百加侖。</p>
<p>邵陽農田，原以糞便為主要肥料，農民往往跋踄數十里，費時三數日，來城區購買糞便。今該廠製成之肥料，經發酵及化解後則成黏稠狀之黑色固體，再經過乾燥塲內乾燥後，其面積重量均大為减縮，　便連輸，肥效復較　便為高；但保守的農民，以未經含用，採用者尚少。</p>
<p>煉　廠碾米廠等　進行革新中</p>
<p>以上所述的是已經完成且在開工中的四廠，實際邵陽鄉村工業示範組計劃中的廠，並不止此。目前正在進行改良設備者有碾米榨油，製糖三廠，正在研究改良土法者有製革，造紙兩廠。這些正在計劃中的廠，都是農村迫切需要的，尤其榨油，製糖，製革，造紙，假使將來有實效可見，將對農村工業有莫大之貢獻。榨油是鄉村最普遍的；製糖在湖南邵陽，渝浦一帶盛產甘蔗區是農民唯一的附業，亦猶江浙鄉村的飼蠶同等重要，製革是邵陽，常德一帶的特殊工業；造紙更是湖南邵陽，新化，瀏陽，桃源等地的農村重在工業，在紙荒的中國，假使能應用新式造紙，相信這些產紙區必能大量出產，以供應國內的需要，减省一大筆外匯開支</p>
<p>邵陽各工業示範廠，以目前的情形來說，其設備等等，實在還在孩提時代，規模小得可憐，可是其前途是未可限量的。這支幼苗的滋長，它將發生使數千年來保守的中國農村社會踏進工業化的大道，也可以說，它將是建設新中國的原動力。不過，凡是一件事業的成功，決不是一蹴而幾的，尤其中國農村的保守性太强烈，農民智識水準太低落，不容易接受新的改革。如以肥料一端言，農民就不願放棄他施用人糞尿和猪牛糞的舊法。所以我們在做實際示範工作以外，還要濟以廣大的宣傅工作，同時我們還要注意的，中國人做事是虎頭蛇尾，不能耐久，以歷史來看，五十年前李鴻章的「洋務」，當時何嘗不做得轟轟烈烈，可是後來失敗了。今日鄉村工業示範，在農村看來，其環境亦無異五十年前李鴻章的「洋務」運動，政府稍一不愼，將流為一種不切實際的點綴品，自生自滅，示範不過是名辭而已，不會發生一點眞實力量。據說現在邵陽示範廠各部門負責指導的外國專家，年底就都要回國；示範組還有一個計劃，就是等到各廠有相當的成果後，將全部銷售與民營。此種計劃是絕對的對的，勿庸我們提出討論。不過，我們要提議大家注意的，鄉村工業示範廠，將來千萬不可落在投機的巿價之手；外國專家未回國之前，應早作物色人才的準備，因為示範廠的機器，都是美國最新式的，我們不是自卑，以　利時接收敵偽工廠，缺乏技術人員不得不令工廠烟囱停止冒烟的現象來看，我們對接替外國專家工作的人才，實在有幾分杞憂！</p>
<p>塘沽新港　　橫斷而　　本報資料室</p>
<h3>海河大沽沙　工程亟需改善</h3>
<p>— 崔德哈</p>
<p>日人草擬塘沽新港工程之初步計劃，遠在民國二十六年蘆溝橋事　以前，大沽附近海岸，據作者之意見，實不適於建築一淺水之人工海港，因建籌費用甚高，而船銷碼頭捐停泊費等收入，尚不足以償還所耗之資金，且新港淤墊迅速，維持費易，反不如改善海河與大沽沙之費省而效宏，故作者以為建築新港，將不顧鉅額之建築與養護費用也。至日人建築斯港之原因，據作者之推斷，有下列數項：</p>
<p>（一）政治因素：日人欲得一港埠，完全脫離外人之影響。按照條約規定，新港在大沽沙航道之北，不在天津港範圍之內。</p>
<p>（二）戰略之因素或亦為重要原因。</p>
<p>（三）建築費用估計太低。</p>
<p>（四）日本工程師不明瞭當地情形，對於泥沙沉墊數　，估計不確，致低估養護費用。</p>
<p>（五）當時海河及大沽沙上之航道情形，至為惡劣。</p>
<p>戰爭結束以後，原有情形根本改變，須加通盤研究比較，一為增加巨額資金，建築新港，以適應新環境，一為耗費較小資金，改善海河及大沽沙而得較佳之效果，二者孰為經濟？</p>
<p>新港之原有計劃，建築碼頭與　　多座，以供五公尺吃水之船隻停泊，港內這大部，則留備沿海淺水汽船，自塘沽船運煤鐵及食　赴日之用。</p>
<p>耗費鉅額資金，建築人工海港，以供沿海淺水汽輪之用。由經濟上觀之，殊屬錯誤，因改善天津港，所費較少也。水運旣較鐵道運輸為廉，貨物之運輸當儘可能利用船舶裝至內地，故不欲於塘沽卸落而必溯河以達天津也。</p>
<p>第河之深度，於民國二十七年初為四·三公尺，經疏濬後，至是年底，為四·六公尺。自民國二十八年至民國三十六年，天津附近之深度自四·九公尺至五·二公尺，此項深度之維持出自水流之冲刷，如欲至五·五公尺之深度，則須於天津附近，稍加疏濬即可，自葛沽及南開二地　灣取直完成後，可得六二〇之水深，而勿慵挖浚，因天津上游低地，放淤成功，海河泥沙問題得以解決，自可得較佳之深度，而毋需再事經常浚渫。天津下游河道之深度，逐漸改善後，自新河至河口之塘沽及大沽可達九公尺，此種對於航運有利情形，將使船泊直接運貨至津，而不在塘沽卸落。</p>
<p>民國二十六年及二十八年大沽沙之淤墊，為不明當地情形之工程師決定建築新港之主因。蓋自民國十六年至二十三年海河淤墊頗烈，自十八年至二十八年所有泥沙總量，　五六·五〇〇·〇〇〇立方公尺經急流冲刷移墊於　門沙上，沙面淤高頗多，航道水深頓减。民國二十六年有一時期內，大沽沙上航道於高潮時，僅三·一公尺，二十八年深僅二·七五公尺，但十二月時，復增加至四公尺，自後沙上航道，逐漸加深，二十九年深度為四·六公尺，三十年為五·二公尺，三十二年為五·八公尺，當光復前後數月疏濬工作停頓，深度復减至四公尺，至三十六年六月底，經挖浚後，可達四·九公尺，大沽沙上情形。自二十八年後，大為改善，灘面高度原為大沽零點以上〇三公尺，經潮流之冲刷，至三十五年已在零點以下一·五公尺。此種情形，因海河之放淤，輸至大沽口之泥沙，大為减少，他日將繼續改善。民國十六年以後海河上游各支流之泥沙輸入海河者，亦大為减少，計十六年輸入海河之泥沙為一〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇立方公尺，十七年為九·八〇〇·〇〇〇立方公尺，十八年為一四·五〇〇·〇〇〇立方公尺，但近數年來，已減至每年一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇立方公尺其他三支流之含沙量與供給之泥沙，年約二三百萬立方公尺，仍將逐漸減少。此後疏濬與維持大沽沙上之深水航道，亦較為容易。如於三十六年七月起，以二個挖泥機繼續疏濬，則年內可達五·五公尺，如按現在方法用二個吸泥機，則三十七年五月可達六·一公尺。</p>
<p>如於塘沽新港防波堤南建築一堤，便潮流集中於兩堤之間，則大沽沙上之航道水深，平均高潮可達七·六公尺。倘南堤完成後，繼續浚挖，則水深可達八·五公尺。現在較大船舶之須寄椗於大沽沙外者，可改泊於塘沽矣。</p>
<p>此項改善工作，尚可伸展至天津，使海河可行駛吃水八公尺之船舶，倘潮白　沱及漳河三支流之放淤成功，則輸入海河之泥沙，大量减少，此項放淤工程，並可收防洪之效。</p>
<p>塘沽新港如發展為一通達外洋輪泊之港埠，在經濟上尚為允當，因塘沽濱臨海灣，地位優越，易於吸引外洋船舶到此寄椗，且上海以北，就腹地之範圍，水陸運輸之便利而言，亦較其他華北各港為優也。</p>
<p>塘沽新港之發展，及大沽沙大沽新河如河道以及主天津港之航道改善，須以最經濟之方法，獲致商業上及運輸上最大利益。</p>
<p>茲比較開發二者之優劣如下：</p>
<p>一，塘沽新港　新港近口航道兩側，須築長堤兩道，建築工費至鉅且因每年有大量泥沙淤墊於港內，須時加疏濬，雖浚挖費用，可採用特種機械，略為减低，但養護費用，仍甚高昂。</p>
<p>塘沽新港冬季結冰，阻礙航行，為另一缺點。港內之冰，雖可用破冰船撞散，惟此項冰塊因潮流力弱，不易流出。至新港之優點，因與海河及大沽沙隔離，不以海河含沙之多寡而水深時時變化也。</p>
<p>二，海河塘沽及天津之開發，須將大沽沙上航道浚深，現在航行海河之船舶，為大沽沙上航道水深所限制，而現在天津港深，實較大沽上航道為滐也。海河及大沽沙之改善，應按下列方式實行：</p>
<p>甲，疏浚大沽沙上航道至四·九公尺深，使與天津港現在之少深度相等。</p>
<p>乙，疏浚大沽沙上航道至五·五公尺深，甲乙兩項計劃可於三十六年用二艘吸泥機工作。</p>
<p>丙，挖浚天津港至五·五公尺深，此項改善工作，可同現在挖泥設備，於三十六年秋季完成。</p>
<p>丁，檳極挖浚大沽沙上航道至六·一公尺深，此項改善工作，可於三十六年底完成。</p>
<p>以上改善程序之優點為：</p>
<p>（一）適合現在運輸之需要，因運至塘沽及天津之貨物，多由吃水五·五公尺至八·一公尺之沿海汽輪也。</p>
<p>（二）利用現有設備改善，費用極２.</p>
<p>（三）潮流之力，足以挾沙入海，無需常川浚挖。</p>
<p>改善大沽沙與海河費用省而時間經濟較之耗費鉅款，建築新港僅供淺水汽輪停泊，其得失可以知矣。</p>
<p>海河應浚挖至八尺水深，直達天津，即使此　費用較另築一新港為尤多，但　長久計，仍宣進行也。疏濬一內港通海之航道，往往耗費頗鉅，但僅此不足以為捨棄內港而於海邊另建新港之理由。例如德國威悉河上之不來海港，距海口六十五公里，昔時河身淤淺，宣僅七〇公尺，經疏浚之後，已可航行吃永八·四公尺船舶，又另築一港於海口，以容納少數吃水八·四公尺以上之大洋輪船，然前項疏浚工程之所費，固遠較後者為多也。又如英國克來德河之格拉斯　港，在昔於大潮時，深僅三英尺，當時一船與論，以為無法改善，使之容納巨舶，故曾於海口進行築一新港，然結果則放棄新港工程，而克來德河之疏浚工程至為有效，克來德河寬由一三五英尺增至四五〇英尺，而水深則由五英尺增至三〇英尺，又如法國之塞納河，由海口至盧昂七六英里間曾斥巨資疏浚，以供大汽輪之進出，其海口港勒哈佛爾城，則供深水輪之審椗。</p>
<p>海河在天津之河身，目前已由五六英尺改善至一七英尺，河寬已由二二〇英尺增至三二五英尺，故進一步改善至河深二六英尺，河寬四五〇英尺，當無困難，如此則大多數現在大沽口外停泊之輪船，皆可直　天津。以上關於威悉河，克來德河與塞納河等之例證，當可同樣適用於天津與大沽口。故海河之疏浚與天津港之開發，較之築大沽新港，以容淺水輪船，實更重要。更如大洋輪船能上駛六〇公里，以達天津，則商業上之鉅大利益，足以抵償治導海河之工費而有餘矣。</p>
<p>海河與大沽沙之情形，自民國二十六年議築新港以後，已大見改進，河身與河口淤塞之　，已因受全部控制而成過去。塘沽新港之建築，與海河之治導，同時並進，而以富有經　之工程師統籌其事，將可得一結論：即如忽視海河，而僅着重於新港，必為一大錯誤也。</p>

<h3>美國第四十九顆星　夏威夷的改制</h3>
<p>— 張子康譯自美國新聞周報</p>
<p>夏威夷添列為美國第四十九州的問題，已於上月卅日在美國國會以一九六驪一三三票通過了，現在祗待眾議院同意，總統簽字批准，即可成為事實。</p>
<p>夏威夷改州問題，在事前，美國曾展開一幕唇槍舌劍的激辯塲面，夏威夷的國會代表法利通（Farrigton）提出這問題時，他說：夏威夷有人口五十一萬九千人。比納瓦達，衛島明，合拉偉，佛門特，或則紐漢雪等州的人口為多。雖然島上人種複雜，內中日本人佔到三分之一，經過這次戰爭的考騐，這些著日本人的忠誠都非常靠得住。夏威夷每年付給聯邦的賦稅，超逾四十六州中的十四州以上。它付了重稅，非但沒有議員代表，而且被視為「化外」之區，且對它產量獨步的食糖，作部份的限制。</p>
<p>法利通除提出許多理由以外，正在進行的幕後，還以極富技巧的詞令爭取與他同黨的共和黨員的同情。他說：（一）要是共和黨在一九四四年提出要夏威夷另成一州的建議得能成功，必能裨益該黨在一九四八年的選舉運動。（二）共和黨的扶披夏威夷改成一州，必能以共和黨不歧視人種的美名得到北方各城的　護。（三）夏威夷在傳統上含有共和黨的血源，夏威夷改州後定能使眾議院，多產出兩位共和黨的議員來。</p>
<p>法利通甚至還談到美國國旗的問題，他說假如夏威夷成立一州後，不致有礙於美國國旗排列上傅統的句稱與確當。他提供了三種式樣以供國會參攷。（參閱附圖）</p>
<p>他反對夏威夷在美國無限的管敎下不能自成一州。他希望看看美國公允精神的行動表現。他說，要是美國答應了夏威夷的要求，就可以給太平洋及遠東任何地區顯明的印象，那就是說，美國在任何地方都是栽培民主種子的</p>
<p>可是，亦有反對法利通那種論調的，共和黨的沙包斯說：「夏威夷改州，將保證延長島上五大家族的金融獨占。」共和黨的每納沙都說：「潛藏在夏威夷農民的勃列琪勢力，可能會選出兩個＂C．I．O＂（美國左翼的產業職工六會）的議員出來。」</p>
<p>民主黨的喬其亞說：「難道說讓島上十八萬的日本人與美國公民享受同樣的參政權利嗎？」</p>
<p>可是無論如何，夏威夷改州問題，已為國會通過了。根據眾議院土地委員會的主席納勃拉斯加的推測：夏威夷改州的事實，可望於本年內實現。他個人的意見是：夏威夷距離舊金山二四〇〇里之遠，最好還是列為加利福尼亞州的一個政區。現在納勃拉斯加的個人意見姑且不管，看來夏威夷改州的最後通過這是不成問題的，成問題的，倒菽是美國國旗的排列問題，除了下列三種以外，還有更好的排列法麽？讀者們猜猜看？</p>
<p>美利堅　國旗上　第四十　九顆星　之謎</p>
<p>最近夏威夷已由美國會議決改為美國之一州，不知此第四十九顆星，在美國國旗上將如何安置：將依上圖，中圖抑或下圖排列　？</p>
<h3>隴東凱歌　鐵血力量　安定西北</h3>
<p>— 青海廿日航訊　徐棠影</p>
<p>隴東是一個袋形的山陵地形，地接陜甘寧的　　，在軍略上是一個極關重要的咽喉，在那裏人口很稠密，莊稼也很繁茂，可惜的是這一帶的許多地方，曾被破壞慘殺成性的共匪，先後盤据了十多年，弄得十室九空，赤地連綿，在白日裏，往往會發現赤身露體的小姑娘和小孩子，甚至於成年男女，也難一律衣冠　體，這種現象，其他地方或許也能看見，但總不如隴東一帶來的普遍而且深刻。今年四月，國軍八十二師，騎八旅由青海開到這裏來駐防，駐防地點，分　陽，合水，寧縣三處，密切注視防制共匪的西進，當八二師等部到遠　東以後，他們第一次看到的，便是隴東民眾，在共匪積年淫威高壓，及慘酷下的悲慘現象，所以國軍八二師所屬的官兵，對於民眾　備加愛護，移防時，沿途不住民房不用民物，不拉民伕，於是博得人民的好評，在以往是很少見的，在過去，共匪佔據隴東的時候，不但糧食衣料，取給於人民，就是鞋襪草料，也强征於民間，一切東西被共匪帶去了，都不給一艾錢，在這樣强取豪奪之下，隴東民眾對於共匪印象極壞，同時認為軍人無條件拿去一切東西，是應該的，但是國軍八二師到了這裏以後，在馬師長少香嚴以律軍，仁以愛民之下，一切公賣公買，這已使隴東的老百姓感激涕零，等到國軍連零星用去的柴草，也發給比巿價還優厚的代價的時候，他們便覺得是奇蹟了，而在短短的一個多月，對國軍的愛護而敬佩之心，也越趨向殷切了，由此足見共匪在過去十餘年中，對於隴東人民的壓榨程度的深重，是不難想見的。</p>
<p>其次，共匪在隴東之時，雖然時時高唱民主自由，但在實際上，他們是再專制再暴虐也沒有的，他們任意藉口來殺害地方士紳與保甲長，說是國特，說是給蔣家軍通信，為蔣家軍供給柴草，處處以恐嚇高壓殺戮，來制服人民，使人民生命，完全失去保障，同時絕對禁止人民開口，我們時常看見人民因偶而議論共黨，便被慘殺的，他們互相說話，即是沒有第三者，對於自己相信得過的人，也就把手捫到耳朶上去說話，假使你去問當地老百姓以過去的事情的時候，他們只是無言流淚，因此我們簡直不明白共黨的行為，與秦始皇的「偶語棄巿」，到底有多少差別。</p>
<p>有攻破的城池　無攻破的人心</p>
<p>在國軍初到隴東的時候。官兵們對於感受十餘年赤化敎育的隴東人民還不無提防懷疑之感，但是事實告訴我們，誠實耐苦的隴東人民的天良，仍然純潔無疵，而且他們都能從善如流，擇善固執，他們都有公秤在心，決沒有失去判別是非好惡的良知，當他們看到國軍八二師，騎八旅官兵的軍紀森嚴，愛民心切的作風以後，馬上知道誰是為國為民的軍隊，誰是禍國殃民的土匪，他們於是決定了取捨從遠，而赤誠擁護國軍八二師，來打擊他們的仇敵共產黨，這是隴東人民天良復活，也是國軍八二師，騎八旅，將隴東人民，由水深火熱之中，一手拯救於　席之上的偉大功績，因此國軍愛人民，而人民亦親近軍隊，同時披肝瀝胆，竭力帮助，這種軍民携手，共同維國的精神，尤其表現於這次合水之戰，當共匪王　子率匪十二旅之眾，同時進攻合水的時候，我方守軍，只有騎八旅馬生智官兵六百餘人，寡眾懸殊，實難達成防守任務，但是國軍八二師，有用不完全的民力，在五月二十九日共　來襲合水，可是在二十八日之時，已有許多同胞，從老遠跑來，向國軍報告共匪的動向，人數，兵器，以及其他情報，使國軍得以從容準備，穩操左劵，一旦戰爭激烈展開後，共匪數萬之眾，滿山遍野，蜂擁而來，以熾盛的火力，圍攻合水城垣，我軍馬生智營，以一當百，沉着應戰，竟將城垣固守三日之久，當初我國軍與敵作戰時，隴東人民，皆攝於共匪人數之眾多，並無國軍以少勝多之信念，及至國軍個個奮勇，衝鋒陷陣，使共匪應戰屢敗　巡不前之時，隴東人民方信國軍八二師官兵，乃國防勁旅，而必得勝利之信心，亦由斯鞏固樹立，於是他們由同情國軍，而敬佩國軍，更由敬佩國軍，而實際帮助國軍，因此在槍彈橫飛，血肉狼籍的戰塲中，他們不惜身家姓命，不分男女老少，都自動給作戰國軍造飯造飯，鋼草喂馬因為這時候服內勤的伙夫馬夫，都增援到火綫上去作戰，無法的可以下來法造飯，因此一切內勤，都由他們來担負，他們旣替國軍造茶送飯，飼護馬匹，而且看護傷兵，包紥傷口，簡直成了國軍的看護員，成了傷者的担榮兵，在這時候，防守合水的兵力，已不是馬生智率領的一營兵力，而是整個合水城內的一　精誠團結的浩氣，終將頑匪殲滅五千餘，而其主力，亦被擊潰，俗語萬眾一心，眾志成城，這可說是在這一次防守合水的大戰中，　軍與合水人民的寫實。</p>
<p>幫助地方政府　重建隴東政敎</p>
<p>國軍二八師不但能够取得民心，戰勝敵人，而且在隴東作了不少的偉大工作，現在莊稼熟了，軍隊替人民收田，人民饑餓，國軍慷慨予以救濟，在前克復盤克鎭之後，國軍鹵獲共軍榖子甚多都無條件的撥於當地貧苦人民，為了正本清源，掃除奸匪，乃協同地方政府，組織保甲，在這一方面，成效很大，同時隴東各地，因　年兵　，地方貧困，政府幾乎無暇顧及敎育事業，所以各學校都很難維持，馬少香師長見於此種情形，乃慷慨解囊，予以補助，使隴東敎育得以重見生機，遙幾件大事，實在是隴東人民的最大幸福。</p>
<p>合水大戰之後，隴東馬上出現了數萬的災民，這一點，國軍方面，雖盡了極大的救濟工作，但仍須由中央設法，此外國軍騎兵，因戰爭關係，曾踏壞民田，馬少香將軍，以為此乃民眾無端的損失，所以特另撥款一千二百萬元，當做地主損失的賠款，人民受領之餘，莫不感激涕零。</p>
<p>加强國軍配備　爭取更大勝利</p>
<p>國軍八二師的官兵，多為河　健兒，他們都是由馬副主任步芳着馬副主任的訓示和指導，他們每次作戰獲勝。常常說：「我們覺得對得起國家，也對得起人民，只是對不起副主任，因為我們也就是尚未完全運用副主任所給予我們的技能和訓練」。由這一段話中，我們可以知道，國軍八二師的前途，是何等燦爛光明，而馬副主任練兵的得人悅服，更是不朽的舉。</p>
<p>綜觀隴東整個戰局，覺得這一方面的一切措施，都使我們放心，因為這裏正有一技鐵鑄鋼打的安定力量，他收拾了殘破的民心，他鼓舞了頹喪的士氣，他重新提起了我們的民族精和戰鬥精神，然而這安定力刦在精神方面的成分佔着主要部份，至於物質配備是很差的我們敢於誠懇的希望，熱切呼籲，負責當局人把這個安定力的物質基礎，如作戰裝備等，趕快充實起來，加强起來，這對於戡亂救國的工作，相信有很大的裨益的，這是隴東人民的希望，也是安定西前大局，戡平內亂的唯一措置，希望中央對此，加上一番嚴正的注意，而有所舉措。</p>
<p>現在國軍八二師，騎八旅仍然從容坐鎭隴東，軍民合作，使共匪不敢越雷池一步我們更相信今後的八二師，騎八旅，將在不斷的進步中，獲得偉大的勝利。</p>
<h3>湘佳黔鐵路紀事</h3>
<p>— 梧州十八日航訊　本報記者梁小中</p>
<p>一條枯毀了的動脈，經過一番　接，已經從死亡中又走回茁壯的成長中，儘管全綫觀成，還需一段更想苦的時日，但是也一定生長得更富生氣。湘桂黔鐵路貫通預計東起湛江，北　貴陽，並通柳州而直達衡陽，會合粵漢路以暢發西南富利，已是指顧問事。自桂南來賓經貴縣，王林等地以達廣州灣（湛江）的　湛綫，已經設立兩工程處積極從事測勘，全長三百九十公里（在桂境者三百公里），兩年之內必可完成（因抗戰之初即已築有一部路基，且沿途地勢平坦所以不難一舉而成）。而且聽說交通當局已經在廣州灣積極從事闢港工作，有使湛江巿成為西南的吐納港口，工程成功，日不沒國經之營之的皇家寶石，黯然失色，大可拭目以觀。</p>
<p>全綫最末也是最艱鉅的工程，為自貴州都勻至貴陽的一百五十公里，山巒起伏，懸崖峭壁，泰半皆為羊腸鳥道，隧道開盤，竟有長達一千公尺者，全段隧道長達六公里，共計三十七個，原定通經雲霧山側的東山坪隧道，竟須開盤二公里半，才能通過，所需工款的浩大，實難想象，乃不得不改道別路過高家橋沿公路而達貴定，雖然道路長出了七公里，然而却省下了近千公尺的隧道工程，至於橋樑建築，則更非短時期可以成功，百多公里的道段，竟有大橋二十五座，小橋一百二十五座之多，全長達二千餘公尺。只是一座貴定大橋便長一百八十公尺，橋柱高達四十五公尺，水流湍急，奠基困難，耗資不貸。但是交通當局也特別注重道一段路，特地另行撥款八十四億元，專事修建，自去年十月初開工，至今已達九月，土方工程已厥成，將來通車之後，貴陽即可成為西南鐵路綱（滇黔路，川黔路，湘桂黔路）的重心，北貢塞外，南通於海，重走京滬，莫不指日可達，則其地位的重要，可以想見。</p>
<p>湘桂黔路橫貫四省，北起衡陽，西抵都筑中輕桂柳而分支湛江全長千餘公里，兩年後條築成功，則貧瘠荒蕪已久的西南，更改舊觀，已經是意料中事，黔桂荒山，有的是發展重工業必備的富藏，從廣西的金·銀·鉛·鋼·鎢·錫·鐵·硫磺·到貴州的煤·鐵·銅·汞·石油·　鉛·以至兩省深蔴的木料，特產（如廣西的茴香，貴州的水銀）莫不可在瞬息之間，傾流於東南工業區域，而沿海的魚　之利，　可分別滋潤於西南山國，使貴州的同胞，不再刮　耙過日，一方面是貨暢其流，另一方面更深厚的意義是促進西南文化的發展，進而南疆有事，兵源嗟咄可達，以一路兼負經濟·文化，國防之重，其重要性可以想見，尤其是將來是將來交通部的鐵路計劃告成，（原計劃係：（一）修補東北，東南及中原區原有鐵路，（二）興建西南，西北各省新鐵路）以貴陽為中心，縱橫西南各省的鐵路，達五條之多，全綫一通，脈絡運行，血道一暢，眞是生氣無限，繁榮可望，我們不由得不向千千萬萬埋首開路的無名英雄，致一片最敬禮！</p>

<h3>近世民主憲政之新動向</h3>
<p>— 危言</p>
<p>作者：楊幼炯</p>
<p>出版：商務印書局</p>
<p>三十五年八月初版</p>
<p>全書一〇八頁</p>
<p>作者楊幼炯先生是我國的政治理論家和憲法學者，對於我國的民生憲政的推動很有貢獻，歷任各大學的政治學敎授，著有蘇聯建國史，國家建設之原理、等書。「近世民主憲政之新動向」是他叙述英美·蘇聯以及歐陸等國最近民主憲政的動向，來作爲我國實施憲政的參考。當此施行民主憲政的前夕，國人都應認淸世界民主憲政的現狀來作一借鏡。須知實行民主憲政並不是一件簡易的事情，這種艱巨的工作我們要不斷的去學習，而且要從實行中去學習，絕非空談所能成功的，尤不是一個騙人的晃子</p>
<p>本書首述近世民主政治演進的大勢。他說現在的世界是民主，政治潮流最洶湧壯闊的新時代。民主政治的思想已經成功了十九世紀以來各國所遵循的建國最高原則。可是民主政治運動最大的　　在過去是財富分配的不均而促成貧富軋　的局勢。在這次大戰之後世界各國應該是建立公平合理的民主社會的好機會。今後民主國家最重要的課題應該致力於財產權分配的均衡以使大家的生活趨於安定。近幾十年來民主政治史上顯著的現象就是由窄狹的選舉基礎，間換選舉和選舉權不平等的選舉逐漸進化到現在的選舉權普及，直換平等普通的灑舉。這纔達到眞正民主政治的地步。</p>
<p>第二章作者談英國憲政的特徽與精義。英國是立憲制度的祖國，英吉利憲法見各國憲政的典型。可是英國的憲法並不是一個成文的文件而是指包括完備肇齊的現行政治制度的全部機構而言。英國憲法上的改革不必等待革命發生始能實行，而是長期歷史發展的產物。所以作者說：「我們論英國的憲法，不一定限於某一時期的特殊制度，而當包括全民生活的組織與制度爲對象」。</p>
<p>英國憲法包括五個重要的因素：（一）歷史上幾種帶有規約性質的文件，如「大憲章」，「權利請願書」，「權利法案」等，？（二）一切議會中所制定的法律，如確定國王的權力，保障人民的權利，推廣選舉權等；（三）一切法庭的判決；（四）「習慣法」的原則和規定，此中大部分是關於政府的職務，權力，執行的方法，以及各機關間的關係等等；（五）慣例。</p>
<p>第三章闡明美國憲政的趨向及其現勢力。美國憲法的特質：第一，它大部分是包括授予權力與禁止權力的文書；第二，它所規劃的個人自由的範圍是置於司法機關監護之下以防止爲政府所侵犯的。美國憲法所間設的民念憲政的基本原則：第一，認人民的主權，政府的設施應以符合民意爲原則；第二，聯邦政府所享有的權力僅以憲法中所授與者爲限。</p>
<p>美國憲政制度以兩黨政治為其運用的基礎。政黨的目的在握得政權，而握得政權的唯一途徑是從競選中得到多數人民的投票。現在美國政治理論的新開展不止是求政治的自田和法律的平等而且還期望世界建立於人類四種基本的自由之上，這四種自由即：（一）言論自由，（二）信仰自由，（三）免受恐懼的自由，（四）免除匱乏的自由。它的理想是要透過國際經濟的合作而樹立社會安全的制度</p>
<p>第四童論蘇聯憲法演變及其特質。蘇聯憲法的特徽：第一，在其政治體制所依據的理論即作爲法律上政治上最高的原則，即以無產階級專政爲蘇聯的團體，而以蘇維埃爲蘇聯的政體；其次，它是一種極端柔性的憲法，可以拿通常立法的手續來修改的。蘇聯的新憲法是趨向於民主主義。在一九三五年第七次蘇維埃大會決議憲法修改的兩個原則：（一）使選舉體系更加民主化，用平等的選舉來代替不完全平等的選舉，用直接的選舉來代替多級的選舉，用秘密的選舉來代替公開的選舉；（二）確定憲法的社會經濟基礎，使憲法適合蘇聯時階段力量的相互關係。在新憲法中首先規定蘇聯為農工社會主義的國家：它的政治基礎是勞動者代表蘇維埃，一切政權屬於以蘇維埃爲代表的勞動者；它的經濟基礎是生產手段之社會主義的公有和國民經濟的社會主　的組織，並確定私人所有權以「各盡所能，各取所值一爲原則。</p>
<p>最後，作者略述法國民主憲政的演變和　國民主政治的　潰，然後　第一次歐戰各國憲法之趨勢和今後民主憲政的新動向在使民主主　的制度更趨於究善，使世界人類有安定康樂的生活。</p>
<p>本人對於這本書祇預備提出兩個意見。第一，作者雖然分別的批評各國憲政的得失，但是對於今後世界整個民主憲政的潮流未能做一個　合的檢討而指出一個總的路綫。第二，關於中國民主憲政的原則和實施，作者根本未曾提及，我們覺得他應該提示一個簡略的方向。雖然他在其他的著述中業經有所申述，但是我們認爲本書中未曾眞及這一點却是個缺陷。</p>
<h3>莫洛亞的迭更司評傳</h3>
<p>— 向秀</p>
<p>二十多年以前，我們文壇上對莎士比亞，歌德，以至巴爾扎克，托爾斯泰諸文學巨匠還甚陌生的時候，迭更司已經和我們浪熟了。我們讀者，依賴於不懂英文的林琴南的翻譯，懷着好奇和激動的心情讀了「賊史」「耐兒小傳」「塊肉餘生述」「雙城記」等小說，一面驚奇於英國人豐富而幽默的生活，一面被這位熱情的作者在心靈上作了種種的拷問，並感染了他的人道主養的思想。不過那時，眞正能瞭解這個英國十九世紀寫實主義的鼻祖者實在很少，因爲藉以認識迭更司生活的文字還沒有人介紹，經過了這一段綿長的歲月後，到了今天，我們才有機會讀到許天虹翻譚的「大衛，高相菲爾」，「雙城記」等巨著，同時，我們還讀到了一部莫洛亞的「迭更司評傳」。這部傳記和迭氏的作品一樣的輝煌。作者是當代法國著名的小說家。他的「法蘭西悲劇」一畫曾在我們讀書界風行一時。他的「雪萊傳」亦曾膾炙人口。</p>
<p>傳記原也是一種偉大的創作。作者首先必須深邃地了解那人物的生活，環境，思想，時代背景，時代思潮等。只有熟識他的社會環境後，從而捉住他個性發展的根源，和他創作的途逕，並佔計他的作品給予當代和後代的影響，纔能作適當的評判。這種傳記，已不僅是枯爆的歷史記述，而是作者艱辛的藝術創造了。</p>
<p>一部優美的人物傳記，它本身就是完整的藝術品。這裏須包含兩個藝術家心靈創造的結晶。這，在我們讀羅蔓羅闌的若干本英雄傳記時，已受到深刻的啓示</p>
<p>迭更司生長在英國十九世紀初，那時英國正從農業社會蛻變爲工業社會。他眼看到農村日趨於衰落，都市的物質文明在膨脹，窮人和富豪之間的距離越來越遠，形成了社會的畸形狀態。他自己是一個貧苦出身的人，因此，他的作品總是表現對窮人的同情，對當代社會深刻的諷刺和攻擊。但因爲他是一個溫情的人道者，他所取的抨擊方式，是一種誠懇的消極的自然主義，他主張負債者的監獄必須廢除，貧民習藝所必須廢除，不良的學校必須廢除，可是用什麽去代替他們呢？怎樣解人民的貧窮呢，迭更司不知道。在這一點上，他和托爾斯泰頗有相似之處。迭更司是用他的「淚」和「笑」向人類控訴的。諷刺家的憤怒的笑，和對於社會不義的憤恨之淚，充滿在他的大多數作品中。另一面，迭更司在文學史上，是英國寫實主義的奠基人。當十九世紀最初三分之一時期，是浪漫主義盛行的時期，迭更司的「匹克紙克遺稿」出版後，才使當時的浪漫主義者大爲吃驚。</p>
<p>莫洛亞精詳地分析了迭更司藝術的生活後，他還對歐洲各國作家的特性作了一個很有趣的比較，他說：</p>
<p>「迭更司供給我們一個極妙的機會來研究這種作用，那就是幽默感。試想，假如有一羣國籍不明的作家遇見了一椿重大的社會上的罪惡，一種災難的起因，一件荒謬絕倫的事物，那會發生怎樣的事呢？俄國人將同情地俯　着這荒謬絕倫的事物，把它當作一個心愛的朋友似地描述出來，然後借手「憐憫」把它抹去了。德國人將在它周圍築起一道朦朧的，形而上學的圍牆來，然後用一種有詩意，浪漫的手法把它變成一個精怪或魔鬼；在這以後，他就會安心地發明出一架十分精密的機器來，把那魔鬼切成許多細片。美國人如果年在三十以上，他將說世界上沒有什麽怪物的；如年在三十以下，他將說怪特有上萬之多。法國人將對那怪物說敎，並且借它來說許多倘皮話。英國人呢，將十分精細正確，地描寫這東西，說明它各種器官的大小，模仿它語言以至詳細的表情、這時讀者（或觀衆）會覺得那英國的作家是眞正以記述可怖的事物或可壓的事物爲樂事的。於是，突然出現了一絛稍稍歪曲的綫條或一句顯然誇張的話，使人明白那種莊重的態度中原來隱藏着嬉笑。那全部可怖的解剖，如此苦心地造成的解剖、將在一剎間——一微笑間——　潰，而更重要的，是它將爲我們除去那眞正的怪物。」</p>
<p>這是何等深刻何等聰明的觀察和比較。迭更司評傳　，莫洛亞發揮了許多極珍貴的見解。在目前，還沒有更好的迭更司傳記以前、這確是一部閱讀迭時小說時的重要參考書。</p>
<h3>文學手冊</h3>
<p>— 王槐德</p>
<p>（著者：艾蕪，出版：文化供應社）</p>
<p>關於文學講話一類的書，坊間可以買到的實在不少，但不是失之太艱澀，使無根底的學習者難於了解，就是取材太貧乏，對於文學的理論體系沒有完整的敍述。倘要求得一本初學者能看得懂，而且有興趣看下去，在看完之後又能得益很多的書，這就如披沙揀金之難了。當然，文學手册並非十全十美的，可是在我看來是比較滿意的了。</p>
<p>著者艾蕪是最能用通的文俗字來寫小設的一位作家，其功力表現於這本書中顯然可見，所以，我想文學手册的本身就是一本大堪玩味的書。然而其中的理論也不光是承襲別人的老調，他自己就有極多的新的見解滲入，而這些見解又往往是發人深省，值得我們仔細研讀，尚待我們繼續發掘的。</p>
<p>全書分三個部份：首論文學的本質；次述文學的工具與材料；末了則對實際創作作一解剖。</p>
<p>頭一部分所包括的文字份量最少，祗佔全書的六分之一，對青年學習文學的態度，文學的功用，文學的發生與發展等等問題，都有所論及。尤其是「文學是服務於什麽人」一段，說「文學永遠是服務於大多數人謀幸福的，爲大多數人說話，替大多數人打抱不平的，鼓舞大多數人爲正義而戰……」與文學是「眞，善，美」之類說法比起來是直率可喜得多了。又如「文學的主要功用是什麼」，著者認爲第一是牠能驅逐我們的利己心，使我們對於陌生人發生親密的關切，激起深刻的同情；其次是能够驅除因襲觀念，使我們對眞實的人生，有着正確的見解；最後是能武裝我們，使我們不和惡勢力妥協。這種看法經過著者的例證，使人看了都有同感。每一談到各種學習文學的困難，著者總以誠懇的言詞勸青年努力克服，親切之情躍然紙上。</p>
<p>第二部份論到「我們應該怎樣收集言語」，有精闢的論斷；由種種立論上看來，我們知道著者在這一方面很下過一些工夫的。又如「我們應該怎樣記錄民衆的言語」，亦寫得頗好。還有「民衆口頭言語的特點」，著者認爲「詞頭豐富」，舉例甚多，如「……很酸，稱做「溜酸」，很甜，稱做「蜜甜」，很辣，稱做「飛辣」，很痛，喊成「精痛」，很毒，喊成「寡毒」，很遠，喊成「老遠」……」一經指出，便覺我們文章中都很少使用，實屬可惜之至。「富於具體形象」，如「跟人說事不成反受幾句閒話的，呌做「碰一鼻子灰」。本來說「自身都難保」這句話。……却還要加上「泥菩薩過江」來形容。」這都是些具體的例子，看的人都易於了解的。「富於含蓄」，如……買牛肉的說：「咦，你這牛肉滲過水吧？」賣牛肉的說：「亂講！上好的，滲過水！」買牛肉的就　聲應道：「是上好的！省政府裏面有板凳請你坐」。尾後一句，就說得含蓄，……如果直說：「政府要抓你去關起的」。那就會惹得對方惱羞成怒，說不定會動武起來。」這是多麽風趣的例子！其他還談到很多的問題，我這里不想一一說明了。</p>
<p>第三部份的「創作的主要條件是什麼」，「怎樣寫作品中的人物」，「創造典型人物與個性」，「怎樣寫人物講話」，「怎樣寫背景」等等，都有簡單明確的解釋。但最爲重要的要算「創作過程是怎樣的」，以魯迅的「藥」作爲材料加以分析。</p>
<p>我不打算替文學手册做一個大網的記載，因爲那於讀者仍是毫無用處的。倘肯細心地把這本書看完，我以爲在我們的頭腦中，對文學一定有一個淸楚的輪廓。實在，著者無論對怎樣小的問題，他都有適當的便來替你弄明白；你記得那例，也就對理論有着透澈的見解了。</p>
<p>總之，文學手册是一本淺近通俗的書，它是有價值的——對於靑年的文學學習者。</p>

<h3>馬先爾的經濟學說</h3>
<p>— 顧文彬</p>
<p>褚葆一著　商務出版</p>
<p>經濟學裏有馬先爾，猶之音樂裘面有斐多汾，哲學裏面有康德，物理學裏有牛頓，愛因斯坦。現在各大學所通用的經濟學敎科書，其中十之八九是根據馬先爾的經濟學說的，還有十之一二是受馬先爾的影響而發展出來的。</p>
<p>馬先爾的經濟學說，旣然在經濟學裏佔據如此重要的地位，那末他的　應該爲每一個學經濟學的人所熟習所研讀了。可是，事實上並不如此，在中國學經濟學的人，除了少數研究院的學生以外，很少有直接念過馬先爾的原著的，很少對于馬先爾學說的整個體系，有一個淸楚的槪念的。原因是馬先爾的原著篇幅浩繁，而又沒有一本中言的入門書籍，爲理論修養尚未深入的人作介紹。</p>
<p>最近讀到商務書館出版的「馬先爾之經濟學說」（褚葆一編）一書？可說是滿足了我多年的渴望。這是一本簡明有力的入門書，全書篇幅不多，僅一百餘頁，把繁複多樣的馬先爾學說體系作了一個淸楚的敍述。書中直接引用原文之處很少，由編者以第三者的口吻加以茶統說明。在介紹理論的部份，除了敍述馬氏本身的理論以外，並介紹理論的源流，馬氏以前學者的貢獻，馬氏以後學者的批評與修正，由此可以看到經齊理論遞變的經過。編者當是一個肯花功夫搜集資料然後下筆的人。</p>
<p>所可惜的是書中錯字不少，句讀錯誤之處尤其多，希望編者能在再版時改正！</p>
<p>在峰火瀰天物價動蕩的今日，恐怕還有不少人願意在暑天裏，靜心讀一點有義意的書籍的。我願意推荐這一本小書，給愛好經濟學的同學。</p>
<h3>讀「羅亭」</h3>
<p>— 述章</p>
<p>「羅亭」是屠格湼夫六部連續性　會小說中的第一部，是繼後諸部的基術的導言。它們是被作者用來表達一個時代底思潮，以及報道當時社會的動態的，特別的是作者的浪漫色彩的笨觸底優美，和對於諸般藝術的素養；吸引了許多的讀者，陶醉了無數的靑年，奠定了他在文壇上的地位。</p>
<p>從「羅亭」中我們看得出當日社會的情况，並且還可以找到未長成的社會政治運動的萌芽。主人公所處時代的黑暗並不下於今日，也許還要更甚些。那時，正是有名的暴君尼古拉一世當政，殘暴專恣；一般先進的知識青年，不朗而然地自己促緊攏來成了一種集團，羅亭便是其中一分子。這種集團是確確實實涵義深長的歷史上的事實，他們禮讚着眞理，藝　，和道德之神。</p>
<p>但是生活在哲學思考和抽象理想中的這些人們眞的幹起事來便完全不適合了；徒託空言者究無補於事的。所以像不生根的浮草，便永遠　有個　流的可悲的命運，無怪作者要給　中的主人公安排下個並不光榮的收塲了。</p>
<p>「羅亭」這部書就是抒寫這個主題的，它的結構異常簡單，內容大致如下：</p>
<p>德密特里，羅亭是三十五歲的俄羅斯地主，並不富裕，由於友人　法男爵的關係，結識了一位貴婦人達爾雅·密哈伊洛夫娜。就在當天謁見的晚上，達爾雅家晚餐後的客應上，羅亭發揮他的雄辯的才能，擊敗了素來肆言無敵的達爾雅的鄰人畢加梭夫，一個蔑視眞理和文化的懷疑卞義者；贏得了所有在座的，主人和鄰人，衷心的景仰和欽佩。他的滔滔不絕的談鋒，所向披靡的辯才，豐盛的思想，火般的熱情；使女主人意爲相見恨晚，摯誠地招待他在她的　間別墅住了下來。</p>
<p>晨他　　到女主人的房中用茶，談話間當地的一位地主列茲橈夫來訪主人，接洽彼此的界址的問題。他是羅亭舊日大學裏的同學，交誼甚寫，後來因爲一再的誤會而分開了，這次會面，仍然經過一塲輕徽的辯難。</p>
<p>羅亭從房中出來、走廊上遇到女主人的女兒，十七歲的美麗的娜泰雅，一個實事求是，熱情的，有着英雄氣質的女孩子，和她的敎師彭果小姐，陪着她們去花園散步，年靑人的兩顆心都蒂生了愛苗；以致引起她那平日互相熱愛着的服玲薩夫的異常的嫉妬。</p>
<p>他的心是沈重的，晚餐就溜走了，回到他寡姊亞歷克山得拉房中，列茲堯夫和她坐在一起——他們也是久已互戀後來就結婚了——列茲堯夫正說起羅亭的家世和他的青年時代，很不直他的行爲，批判他侈談崇高的純潔。</p>
<p>二月後的某天早晨，娜泰雅在花園中又遇到羅亭。他向她應約的暗示了他的愛意，迷亂了她，連跑過服玲薩夫的身邊也沒注意；早餐桌上，服玲薩夫借故尖銳地　刺了羅亭，一座諤然，但羅亭竟啄忍了，不曾反駁。</p>
<p>餐後，羅亭偷偷約了娜泰雅晚間在花園中相會，這次，他赤裸裸的傾吐了愛戀的積　，熱情的火燄燃着了她的心，勇敢的回說她也愛他，匆匆的分別了。羅亭　自慶着幸福，可是，惡運馬上就降臨到他的身上。</p>
<p>矮樹叢中、拍達列夫斯基女主人的秘書，諂諛的小人，偷看飽了這一幕，密吿了主人，從此以後形勢就變了。羅亭不再似貴賓的受款待，而遭到了冷淡，娜泰雅也難得見面了。當晚，他就得到她的密書約他次晨在阿夫杜聲池邊作最後的訣別。</p>
<p>那天，娜泰雅吿訴羅亭，她母親堅決地反對他們的戀愛，要她和他斷絕。當她問起他有什麼對策的時候，他很懦怯地說了「祗有服從命運。」於是，她痛責他的妄談獨立、犧牲，祇是個懦夫，因為無聊，才來鬧戀愛意見，悲落地毫無猶預地反身跑的玩了。</p>
<p>羅亭沮喪的回去。寫了稱封吿別的信，一封給服玲薩夫，一封給娜泰雅，當晚就辭別了主人動身回自己的田莊去。</p>
<p>二年後，傳來消息，服玲薩夫與娜泰雅在莫斯科訂了婚。又過了幾年。在泰卜夫地方的頭等旅館裏，列茲堯夫意外地遇到了坎坷失意的羅亭，他們恢復了舊日的情誼；晚餐間，罷亭吐訴了別後的漂流生活，歷次事業失敗的經過，歲月催人，一事無成。他不復再是以前的雄辯滔滔了，疲憊困頓，自承祗會說空話，終不免失敗，將會有壞的收塲、於是分別了，</p>
<p>是的，他不曾有個好收塲，一八四八年七月巴黎革命戰役中，赤色共和黨幾乎完全被敉平，最後死了個波闌黨員，這波爾黨員就是德密特里·羅亭。</p>
<p>主人公羅亭是那時代的典型人物，代表着當時許許多多滿懷熟血，熱烈希求眞理和改革的靑年，是時代的英雄，又是它的犧牲者；他是個大言木慚者，眞所謂說起話來是巨人，做起事來成矮漢，雄辯不輸提摩斯西尼斯，，旦加入艱苦的試鍊，馬上就丟盡面子失敗了。</p>
<p>這不和我們現在所處的時代中能不止一次地遇到的靑年一般無二嗎？但，請注意，羅亭是代表着一八四〇年，過去一世紀的；人家往後是怎樣進步的—可以從第二部小說「貴族之家」中主人公拉夫列　茲身上找到—以至於今天的成罰　樣的一個國家，而我們呢？一經比較　將如何的分辯呢？</p>
<p>親愛的讀者們，這裏，我掬誠地介紹這部「羅亭。」</p>
<p>滬濱絮語</p>
<h3>小圈子及其他</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>上海這地方雖然混亂複雜，但仔細推敲，却也井然有序。比如說上橋推三輪車，有一定的地段，一定的時間，一定的頭腦，不得亂來。又如扒兒手，要飯的，攏攤子，都有他們自憶的小　予和頭腦，這些頭腦，才是上海下層階級的主宰；他們自付他們的天國，他們的世界，他們自己的羣衆；大家有條不紊，絕對遵守服從。</p>
<p>如若在某一個區域裏出了事，「按圖索　」，只要頭腦對你拍胸脯，就是一句法律，一個絕對有效的諾言。所以，你如懂得上海，就不覺得上海如何神秘，如何紛亂。</p>
<p>但是，從相反的方面看，他們絕對是「小圈子主義」，「　權」的信徒。他們也在這圈子根深蒂固，牢不可破。他們定下的陋規，你絕對無法改變，他們的區域　芬，誰也不敢侵佔分毫。</p>
<p>這是上　的衆生相，也是中國社會縮影之一。</p>
<p>有位朋友從XX來，對我大談宦海浮沉錄，他對官塲的人事糾紛，排擠傾軋的風氣，感到非常的頭痛，他說：「你只看見「小圈子」，每一個小圈子拚命把自己圈子裏人捧上台去，而排擠不是圈子裏的人插足進來；於是你一個系統，他一個系統，彼此攻訐，互相仇視，這情形，實在使人痛心」。</p>
<p>其實我這朋友有點大驚小怪，你看看那一處不講系統，那一角不是小圈子？你看，推三輪車上橋的人，你不是這「頭腦」手下的人，你別想去隧道五百塊錢。</p>

<p>人物誌</p>
<h3>左舜生印象</h3>
<p>— 平齋</p>
<p>我常覺得靑年黨的一大特色是不尚空談，實是求是—在政策已經決定之後，更決不左瞻右顧，趫超不前。民社黨的人才並不少，開起會來雄辯滔滔，可是却難得獲致初合實際的結論，結果是由聚訟紛紜而相持不下，而各趨極端，終於釀成了分裂的局面。相形之下，靑年黨實在是「成熟」得多了。</p>
<p>靑年黨之所以能養成這種正視現實的精神，我想應當歸功於領導得人。去年夏天，召開國大，制定憲法，和擴大政府基礎這些大事尚在谷方面交換意見之中，我就曾在烈日下分頭訪問過好幾位民社黨和靑年黨的主腦人物。他們的意見已經都在報紙上法表過了，在今日看來，都已成爲陳跡。然而，有一印象却仍舊非常鮮明，就是：民社黨的理論多，冠冕堂皇而不着邊際；靑年黨却立刻提供了許多完全是切合實際的具體的問題，而說話最坦白，能度最明朗的，則是現在的農林部長左舜生。</p>
<p>左氏很健談，很風趣，那時因為身體不適，所以有些不修邊幅的樣子，頗有名士之風。誠然，海格路的靑年黨總部門禁森嚴，司閣更是目空一切，有些令人不敢請敎，但是地豐路左公館的客廳裏，却常是談笑風生，毫無拘束的—因爲，主人常常說一句話：「這是咱們自己人談談，不必在的上發表。」而客人也尊重着主人的意見。</p>
<p>有一次，無意中話題談到了那時某些人提出的立刻無條件停戰的主張。左氏靠在沙發裏大笑起來：「本來麽，你打麻將贏了大脾、就站起身來想走了，不准別人打下去—可是別人輸了錢却肯不翻本嗎？」</p>
<p>實在，那時大戰的序幕還沒有展開。但左氏却很背定也很嚴肅地斷言：「山東和山西是個急症，急症倒容易治好；東北和西北却是個慢症，慢症可就得好好醫治了。」</p>
<p>左氏現在終於出任農林部長了，可是他出長農林部之說，由來已久。在當局剛剛表示決心擴大政府基礎的時候，左氏出山的空氣又馬上濃厚起來。於是我又去拜訪他，他縐着眉笑了：「又是農林部！不知怎樣，在重慶的時候就有這句謠言，說是我要幹農林部了，有一位記者先生就在報上提起了這個話。嚇，這可眞害苦了我！薦信來了那麼一大堆！」他用手比了一比，那堆信的高度大概在兩尺與三尺之間。</p>
<p>然而，「謠言」畢竟成了事實了。他有一次曾坦白地說明了他的苦衷：「我們以黨的身份參加政府，又和社會賢達如王雲五先生那樣以個人的身份參加政府的情形不同。我們不能不有許多考慮、譬如說，自己黨內同志們的期待就不能辜負。而且，加入之後又能不能放手作事呢？困難與是很多很多。同志們集中在中央機構裏也不好，我們是作爲一個政黨而競爭的，凡地方政府裏當然也不能不有所準備。」</p>
<p>終於，在這幾天的報上，我們又讀到了地方政府行將改組一部份的消息。</p>
<p>青年黨似乎正採取着「步步爲營，穩紮穩打」的戰略。左氏的出山，李幼　（璜）的堅辭經濟部長，是不是可以看作同一戰略的兩面呢？</p>
<h3>收費問題</h3>
<p>— 徐繼靖</p>
<p>雖然現在還是暑假，下學期的學費問題己經爲各方面所關心了，教育當局只有少得可憐的敎育經費，要來維持一個不算小的教育事業，確是够費苦心的，事實上要想學校的能够好好生存下去，收取學生的學雜費，不失是一個辦法；但是為了顧到社會經濟的衰落，學生家庭的負祖，他又不得不來限制學校的收費。</p>
<p>公文學校下學期學雜費敎部已訂了一個標準（見十四日本報），以中學言，一個寄宿的高中學生只要繳八萬七千元，這數目在現在四五十萬元一石米的時候看來是相當少的。但是學校負責人的問題又來了，因為政府所給予公立學校經費，敎師的待遇，是照公務員標準發給的，如衆所知，公務人員的薪給是遠趕不上生活需要，但是一般私立學校的敎師待遇則比較的好，因爲他們的來源是學生繳費，所以在上學期的一般情形說，私校敎師的待遇比公校高，這對公立學校是一種打擊，因爲許多公立學校之所以能有今日的地位，能有今日的成績，主要是由于他擁有一批優良的敎師。要是這種待遇不平的情形繼續下去，道批經騐學識都較優良的敎師，便有溜入私校的危險。要挽救道個危機，公立學校於是征收尊師金的性質雖應是志願捐獻但事實上則是强制性的征收，也就是變相的學費。尊師金的數目，在江蘇的省校，就我所知是一石米，這錢顧名思義，當然是用作增加敎師的待遇，但是據統計結果，上學期京滬綫公私立中學敎師待遇之比是二：三，也就是說私校敎師的收入比省校多二分之一，現在教部規定下學期不准收取尊師師金了，不知許多公立學校尤其是幾個有名的省校，如何去　決這個難題。</p>
<p>私立學校的收費，在上海已取銷了硬性的限制、眼看各地都　追隨其後，不過在這物價劇烈波動的時期，各私校都還遲遲未敢決定下學期的收費數，但照情勢推測，這將是一個很驚人的數目。私校的經濟來源主要是靠收費，在物價高漲的現階段，要單方面制止學費不漲，是不可能的。不過希望這費能收得合理用得合理，所謂收得合理，是說應該把數額俊可能的减到最低限度；所謂用得合理，要把收入完全用在敎師的薪給與學校的維持上，也就是絕對做到「取之學生，用之學生」，不爲一二私人所漁利，必如此，學生家長縱然要咬一哎牙也是甘心的。</p>
<p>（編者按：此問題希望有關方面能具體地列舉事實，提出討論。）</p>
<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>在電影院中</p>
<p>我們不妨武斷地下一個定義，電影院越多的地方，民衆敎育越發達，因為電影有着敎育的功用，看影片比讀死書來得易於領會。美國敎育當局已把敎育與電影打成一片，以軍事敎育而論，差不多上一點鐘講堂，要開映一場電影。以後的敎育是以目代口、敎師可以把口封起來，而照樣可以收到敎育的功效。美國的電影院幾乎成爲藥裏的甘草，任何小城市村鎭至少有電影院兩家，他們的電影院都是小型的，除少數大城市外，很難找到像大光明那麽大氣派的電影院。美國電影院是聯鎖制下的寗鑒兒，每一家電影托拉斯擁有一兩千個電影院，所以你到處可以見到Paramount　Theatre，FoxTheatre，Roxy　Theatre，電影自下午二時開映，不分塲，一直開到下午十一時爲止，你的家裏如果沒有冷氣，你買一張票子進塲由二時坐到十一時，沒有人來把你　出去。可是美國人有一種牌氣，除特別好的片子外，看過一塲便不想看第二塲，因爲看第二塲時不易引起好奇心，弄得不好，速第一塲所有的印象都給敗壞了。買票是要排隊的，旣不分塲，買票人也不中　，那長蛇陣一直生存着，票房是沿街的，買票隊伍就排在人行道上，倘有好片開映，隊伍從票房起一直轉彎抹角排到第二條街，甚至繞幾個圈子的，煞是奇觀，票房邊有一家小舖子，專賣冰洪淋，炒米，糖菓。炒米每包二角，美國女人專喜歡吃牠、淡而無味，比老棉花要脆些，發出柔和的聲響，美國小姐一進塲，把身體在椅上一躺，兩只大腿擱在前座的靠背上，就吃假炒米來，此呼彼應，有些聒耳，但有一種好處，她們吃炒米時便不再講話，否則秩序更亂。在上海住慣的人，染了英國紳士作風，電影院不講話，赴宴穿燕尾服，美國人沒有那麽一套，祇要不在電影院呌　，沒有人來千預你的，可千萬不要忘記把帽子摘下來，否則後座有人會大呌Take　it　off或者把一只錁幣擊落你的頭飾。在美國電影院中和女伴鈎肩搭背或有更精彩的演出，沒有人來干預你，因爲看電影的人，沒有理由分心去看電影以外的表演的。（二七）</p>
<h3>張角的一生</h3>
<p>— 周冷</p>
<p>魏晉人物雜論之四</p>
<p>假如說于吉是當時農民運動的理論家，那無疑地張角便是這一運動的領導者。關於張角一生事跡，後漢書皇甫蒿傳里有段很好的報導：</p>
<p>「初，鉅鹿張角，自稱大賢良師，奉事黃志道，百姓信向之。角分遺弟子使於四方轉相誑惑，十餘年間，徒衆數十萬。連結郡國，自靑徐幽冀荊揚兗豫八州之人，莫不畢應。張訛言蒼天已死，黃天當立，以白土書京城門寺及州郡官府，並約中常侍封諝徐奉爲內應，以三月五日內外俱起，未及作亂，事發。……角等知事己露，晨夜馳　諸方，一時俱起，皆以黃巾爲標幟，旬日之間，天下響應，京師震動·」</p>
<p>雖然這是簡略的導報，但從這里已經可見張角的爲人了，從他計劃起事的秘密部署而至案發勃然行動，這手腕，這魄力，決不是如一般人所認爲「妖賊」所能做得到的。</p>
<p>那麽，張角的政治目的是什麽呢，最好的解釋就是他們以黃市作為標幟這一點。據晋書骨五卷與服志里說：「巾以葛爲之，形如慆，而橫著。古尊卑之共服也」，換句話，不就很明白表示出來，他們是打破階級觀念主張人類平等的嗎。而且，三國志蜀魏書張魯傳也載：「張魯據漢中以鬼道敎民，皆敎以誠信不欺詐，有病自首其過，大都與黃巾相似。又置「義舍」，又置叉米肉懸於義舍，行路者量腹取足，若過多，鬼卒軐病之。」則他們的舉動，雖然帶着濃厚的宗敎色彩，但這些作爲、何嘗不是否認私有，主張共同消費的嗎？</p>
<p>固然，這些措施在今天來講，是毫無不足為奇的，但在幾千年前，張角意敢在對建地主嚴厲統治下的社會，作這麼一種大胆的嘗試，這思想，這行動，難道不值得我們驚奇嗎？依此、則當張角勢力蔓延之際，作爲統治力量的代表如曹操劉備哀紹之流，所以忘記了互相間的對立，而集中力量積極圍剿，甚至張角死了，還要剖棺戮屍，正可以說明張角到底是什麼人，而解釋了階級的矛盾，實在是超過一切的道理了。</p>

<p>市間所售磁董磁碗，輙鋼書「八大山人」字樣，昔嘗疑其所本，及讀八大山人傳，乃恍然知之，蓋磁器多出景德，景德密邇南昌，南昌者，山人故居也。按山人，故明代宗室，佚其名，弱冠，遭國變，遂棄家爲僧，山居二十餘年，從學者嘗數百人，後受聘於臨川令胡某，年餘，忽嬰狂疾，裂其僧服，焚之，佯在市肆間，人莫能識，其姪某延至其家，久之，乃愈。</p>
<p>山人工書善畫兼嗜飲酒，然不能盡二升，貧士或市井屠沽招飲，輙往，旣往輙醉，醉後，　潘淋漓，不甚愛惜，惟貴顯者以重金索之，亦弗可得也。一日忽大書「啞」字於門，自後不發一言。邵靑門（長蘅）客南昌，見山人於北蘭寺，剪燭夜話，索筆書幾上相酬答，其先狂後啞之狀類此。</p>
<p>山人初爲僧，號雪筒、更號曰人屋，曰驢漢，最後以八大山人終。今之知山人者，第以書畫家名之，不知山人處亡國之餘，丁喪亂之續，搤捥其痛哭，固不下於謝　鄭所南之徒也，悲夫。</p>

<h3>空中碼頭（下）</h3>
<p>— 顧均正</p>
<p>總之，若以空中碼頭爲空間船的出發點，一切條件差不多己近於理想。以每秒五哩的初速開始、沒有空氣的阻力，事實上只要再加上每秒一哩半到兩哩的速度，就可以脫離地球，而向月球進發了。</p>
<p>這個空間碼頭的倡議者爲封·披爾貴脫氏（Von　Pirquet），披氏的原意是想創造一個太陽系中探險旅行的基地，由於這基地的本身具有高速度，所以牠可以使空間船獲得更多的速度。又由於這基地上差不多己成爲眞空，所以可以作爲液體燃料的安全儲藏庫。那些燃料只要不直接受到太陽光的輻射、（因爲輻射足以使液體受熱而蒸發），就可以較遠留存在那里，歷久不變。</p>
<p>空中碼頭還有許多其他的特點，即使　開空間旅行，　還是有着牠自己的價值。原來空中碼頭與地面比較起來，至少有三個重要的特點：</p>
<p>（一）這碼頭在眞空中運動、而這個眞空比之地面上所能造成的更為完全，更為永久。</p>
<p>（二）在這個碼頭上易於造成最高與最低的溫度。在那上面的任何物體，如果單着用納金屬片來製成的　面，把太陽的直接輻射反射了開去，那末他本身的熟就會以輻射的形式而敬去，在幾分鐘之內，冷到近於絕對的零度，比之在實騐室裏所造成的最低溫度還要低。但是一方面，在那里可容易把太陽的光綫集中於一個目的物，把牠加熱到超過電弧的溫度。</p>
<p>（三）在這個碼頭上可不受重力的影響。</p>
<p>空中碼頭由於具有這三種基本的不同狀况，所以着使一個實騐家住在這里，常可完成地球上所不能完成的實騐。例如電子學家可以在這個巨大的高度眞空中建立起一個完全的眞空實騐室。物理學家可以在這里研究高溫與低溫、以及不受空氣所遮著的太陽輻射與宇宙射綫，天文學家在這里裝置了具大的望遠鏡、將不她其笨重，並且可以不受空氣的阻碍。生物現象與化學現象是否受重力的影響，在地面上是無法實騐的，現在有了這沒有重力的中空碼頭，生物學家與化學家也一定樂於把這個問題作着有計劃的研究。</p>
<p>此外還有人提議在同一的軌道上，分別建築着三個空中碼頭，使成等邊三角形的三個頂點，以作全地球規模的無綫電與電視替讀站，據理論的估計，這樣的替續站所需的費用，較之建築在地面上的反爲節省。也有人提議在每二十四小時環繞地球一次的空中碼頭上，建築起一具巨大的平面反射鏡，把剛沒入地平綫下的太陽的光，反射到地面上來作爲大城市中晚上的照明之用。若是應用拋特面反射鐘，把太陽光集中了射到地面上來，更可以改變一地的氣候，劍造或消滅風暴，溶解冰山、而在戰爭的時期，更可以作為使敵人無法抵抗的武器。</p>
<p>總之，空中碼頭上的狀況，在人類的經騐中完全是新的、在新的狀之下，會產生新的結果，那是沒有　問的事，所以我們若是有了這樣一個可作純粹的學術研究的基地，那未新的發現必可層見疊出，說不定其中的一個發現，就可以淸償所有的　用而有餘呢！</p>

<h3>Wedemeyer Visited the Chairman Yesterday, Visited Our Military and Political Leaders in the Afternoon, The U.S. Side is Studying the Provided Information</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 23rd] The 23rd marked the official commencement of General Wedemeyer's activities in Nanjing. He spent the majority of the morning in meetings at the U.S. Embassy. Attending were Minister Stuart, Admiral Cooke, and senior officials from the U.S. Military Advisory Group in the Embassy's Military Attaché Office. During the meeting, in addition to the information collected under the Minister's guidance, the Ambassador offered his personal insights gained from years of experience in China, which Wedemeyer greatly valued. At 10:00 AM, the Minister accompanied Wedemeyer and his interpreter to meet Chairman Chiang and his wife, for a discussion lasting approximately one hour. At noon, Wedemeyer and Cooke dined with the Minister. At 2:30 PM, Wedemeyer, still accompanied by the Minister, paid a visit to President Zhang, holding discussions for over twenty minutes. Wang Yunwu and Weng Wenhao were also present. Subsequently, he visited Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, speaking for eighteen minutes, followed by a visit to Defense Minister Bai Lexi and Chief of Staff Chen Cheng at the Ministry of National Defense. In the evening, he and the Minister attended a private dinner hosted by Chairman Chiang and his wife at their official residence. The photograph shows Chairman Chiang shaking hands with General Wedemeyer during their meeting (taken by Hu Chongxian of the Lixingshe).</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 23rd] Watson, the press liaison for General Wedemeyer's delegation, told reporters on the evening of the 23rd that they were busy all day. The morning's meeting only covered the review of a portion of the acquired information. On the 24th, they will continue to study the information gathered by the Embassy and the U.S. Army and Navy in China. They have received a small portion of the reports provided by the Chinese government but have not yet had the opportunity to examine them. Watson declined to answer questions regarding the extent to which their investigation and evaluation would influence U.S. policy toward China, stating that their mission was solely to investigate and evaluate the current situation in China and Korea, and to submit a report to President Truman. Beyond that, he could not comment. The delegation's mission does not focus on any specific matter, as China's current difficulties are the result of a complex interplay of factors. They will visit every region they should and can visit. The truth about the Beitashan incident is also under investigation. If the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, or even the Communist Party can provide information or opinions beneficial to the overall situation, they will study them all. They will meet with a number of individuals, but as of now, there is no intention to enter the Communist areas. The delegation's plan of action for on-site investigations will be determined after sufficient study of the available information, possibly in early next week. At that time, each expert will begin their individual work.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] A spokesman for General Wedemeyer stated that the group will travel to Shanghai this week to discuss matters with American commercial organizations.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Admiral Cooke, Commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, flew from Shanghai to Nanjing on the morning of the 23rd to visit U.S. Ambassador Stuart and General Wedemeyer, the newly arrived special envoy of the U.S. President, and returned to Shanghai in the afternoon.</p>
<p>[Local News] Admiral Cooke will inspect the operations of the U.S. Navy's various institutions in the city today.</p>
<h3>U.S. Republican Congressman Broadcasts, Advocates Assisting Our Country in Suppressing Rebellion, Dong XianGuang Talks About Wedemeyer's Mission to China</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco, 23rd Broadcast: U.S. Republican Senator Brewster, in a broadcast speech in Washington, advocated extending the Marshall Plan to the Middle East and the Far East, especially to China. He stated, "If China falls into the hands of the Communists, our efforts in Europe will be in vain." He also said, "The United States should assist Chairman Chiang in quelling the Communist rebellion. We cannot pursue one policy in Greece and another policy in China." Senator Taft, Chairman of the Senate Policy Committee, said in the same broadcast that a year and a half ago, when Marshall was sent to China as an envoy, he had strongly urged Chairman Chiang to negotiate with the Communist Party and make concessions to the Soviet Union according to the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. Now, however, our country's policy toward China has changed, and I hope to continue to maintain this policy that has already changed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] The U.S. government hinted on the 23rd that what the Wedemeyer delegation is paying attention to during its investigation of the situation in China is how to find ways to complete a new or stable currency reform and how to reduce the large amount of military surplus, which would be conducive to the recovery of the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Executive Yuan's Information Bureau held a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 23rd. Director Dong Xianguang answered reporters' questions as follows: Question: It is rumored that the basic salary of civil servants will be adjusted from August, doubling it. Is this true? Answer: This statement is not accurate. Question: Are there any new developments regarding the Dalian issue? Answer: There are no new developments. Question: Is it possible that the Chairman will go to Lushan this summer? Answer: As of now, the Chairman has no plans to go to Lushan. Question: What is General Wedemeyer's mission to China this time? Can the Director provide any clarification on this? Answer: General Wedemeyer's visit to China will certainly enable our government to further understand American opinions, just as he will help the American government understand the situation in China. General Wei's mission to investigate the facts is to promote mutual understanding between China and the United States. The Chinese government will do its utmost to assist General Wei in achieving this task.</p>

<h3>Our Authorities Will Provide Economic, Political, Military and Other Information</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] Chinese officials have prepared a large number of documents, charts, and tables to present to Wedemeyer, including those describing the increasingly tense Sino-Soviet relations, including the Soviet army's removal of industrial equipment in the Northeast, the transfer of a large number of Kwantung Army munitions to the Chinese Communists, and the occupation of Lushun and Dalian, endangering China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Regarding the economy, Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Resources Commission, will be responsible for providing Wedemeyer with all the information the United States needs. He will also explain several construction projects that would be impossible to start without American material assistance. Regarding politics, Wedemeyer will be informed of the necessity of the recent general mobilization order, and it will be emphasized that the current government's foundation has indeed been expanded, including the Democratic Party, the Youth Party, and some non-party members. The government's "democratization" plan for general elections in October and constitutional governance in December has been severely hindered by the Chinese Communists. Chinese military authorities will submit lengthy reports on the military situation in order to seek American assistance and shorten the time required to suppress the rebellion.</p>
<h3>Peng Xuepei Arrives in Dihua</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 23rd] Political Committee Member Peng Xuepei flew from Lanzhou to Dihua at 4:10 PM today. Peng told reporters that he came to the Northwest only for a personal trip and will return east after staying in Dihua for a few days.</p>
<h3>Welcoming Wedemeyer in a Sweat, The Capital's Unprecedented Heat in Seventy Years</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>[Nanjing, 22nd] General Wedemeyer's third visit to China coincides with Nanjing's unprecedented heat in seventy years. The outdoor temperature is as high as over 100 degrees, and the red line on the thermometer continues to rise. The welcomers waiting at the airport on the Dajiaochang Airport have their clothes soaked through countless times. Even Song Ziwen, who arrived at four o'clock, immediately took off his coat as soon as he got out of the car, and his snow-white shirt was completely soaked with sweat. The strangest thing is that Ambassador Stuart was still wearing a thick woolen hat on such a hot day, and sweat was dripping down. Many people were afraid that the old man would not be able to stand it.</p>
<p>General Wedemeyer, who was originally said to arrive at four o'clock, did not arrive until 5:20 PM. Those who had been waiting at the airport for a long time had been waiting for more than three hours. Before Wedemeyer got off the plane, many people were guessing what clothes Wedemeyer would wear today, but few guessed that he would wear civilian clothes. His tall figure, blue suit, and red face, especially with a "futuristic" tie, made him look more like a diplomat than a famous military strategist.</p>
<p>General Wedemeyer left China only in April last year. This time, he revisited this land only one year and three months apart. Revisiting the old place made him feel more親切. After getting off the plane, the first person to greet him was Ambassador Stuart. Old friends reunited and exchanged greetings, which was indescribably 親切. The photographers took many hours of photos during this opportunity. Then, Director Ling Qihan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs introduced Wedemeyer to the welcomers one by one. When he was introduced to Song Ziwen, they shook hands and both exclaimed "Ha!" When Wedemeyer first arrived in Chongqing, Song had greeted him as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and they had been very close ever since. Old friends reunited, and they held hands tightly. Wedemeyer also said very affectionately: "Long time no see, how are you." Then he introduced Minister Yu, Minister Bai, Chief of Staff Chen, Acting Commander-in-Chief Gui, etc. Everyone was an old friend, so when they greeted him, they all said: "We meet again, how are you," or "I am very happy to meet this time." When introducing Sun Liren and other famous generals of the anti-Japanese war, many people had worked with Wedemeyer in Shanghai or had worked under him. Before shaking hands, they saluted first, which made General Wedemeyer, who was wearing civilian clothes, wonder whether to return the salute or shake hands? One person who was more Americanized simply said: "OSBS, long time no see, how are you." Of course, there were also some new friends, such as Mayor Shen Yi.</p>
<p>After the introductions, they were about to inspect the honor guard. A foreign photographer suggested taking some close-up shots, so they asked Ambassador Stuart and Wedemeyer to act like they were talking cordially. Wedemeyer and the officials of our government took a group photo, and finally asked Wedemeyer and Minister Wu Wen to shake hands and take a group photo. The two faced each other and had to exchange a few words. Wu said in a humorous tone: "It's very hot today," which made everyone laugh.</p>
<p>After the photographers were satisfied, the ceremony of inspecting the honor guard began. When Wedemeyer, who was at least a head taller than the tallest member of the honor guard, walked past the soldiers, I believe he must have thought of the scene when he was training soldiers in Yunnan.</p>
<p>We have welcomed and sent off many people on the Dajiaochang. Here, we have welcomed senior government personnel who returned to the capital after 复员, we have welcomed and sent off Special Envoy Marshall, and we have also sent off the delegation of the Chinese Communists. Each welcome or send-off represents the beginning or end of a political stage. Today, we have come to welcome General Wedemeyer, the special envoy of President Truman, which represents the beginning of a new era. We congratulate Wedemeyer on the success of this trip.</p>
<h3>Personnel With Meritorious Service in the Siping Campaign to Be Awarded Medals Today, National Army in Various Routes in Shandong are Dividing up and Suppressing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd] The award ceremony for personnel with meritorious service in the Siping Campaign is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 24th, with a total of 78 medals and more than 800 badges to be awarded.

<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] The war in southern Jilin has gone from tense to stable in the past 36 hours. After the National Army on the Jilin-Haining Road retreated to the Shuangyang Highlands and the strategic strongholds in its southern suburbs to await an opportunity to advance, Shuanghe Town, which had undergone several tug-of-war battles, has become a military vacuum. This is because the 共匪 has sensed the shaking of the Meihekou stronghold and the double crisis of going deep into the ambush, and only uses small groups to harass the villages and towns on both sides of the Jilin-Haining Road. The railway on the northern section of the Jilin-Haining Road between Jilin and Xiyang is operating as usual.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Yanzhou, 23rd] The 共匪 in southwestern Shandong are in a state of exhaustion and fleeing in panic after the National Army's various generals divided up their forces to encircle and suppress them. Among them, after the 共匪 outside Tengxian, Zouxian, and Yanzhou in the Xuzhou-Yanzhou section east of the Jinpu Railway were cleared by the National Army, the remnants of Chen Yi's troops fled to the Phoenix Mountain and Nieshan areas on the border of the four counties of Si, Zou, Fei, and Teng, attempting to sneak back into the Yimeng Mountain area.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Linyi, 23rd] The 共匪's Ninth Column, which attempted to sneak into Nanma, has been defeated by the National Army, with a loss of at least one brigade. In addition, three other columns have also suffered considerable losses. Starting on the 23rd, the National Army on the Nanma and Linqu routes are continuing to attack.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 23rd] The war between Anhui and Henan is quiet. There are only more than 400 bandits in the city of Boxian, led by the puppet county magistrate Feng Dunzi. There are not many 共匪 in the city of Luyi. The main force of Wei Fenglou's troops, more than 1,000 people, is north of Huaidian, with unclear intentions.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 23rd] The 共匪 in western Shandong have begun a general retreat. There was a fierce battle in Jining on the 22nd all night. The 共匪 attacked the city 12 times and were wiped out more than 8,000 people. On the morning of the 23rd, the bandits could not support themselves and collapsed and retreated. The defending army followed and wiped them out, and recovered Daizhuang and Yangshanjie, which are three kilometers north of the city. The National Army's counterattack continued to achieve great victories, killing and wounding more than 5,000 bandits, including one column commander, a chief of staff, and 53 staff officers. The National Army in Wenshang wiped out more than 1,000 bandits on the 22nd. Commander-in-chief Yao Wu went to Taian to see a doctor on the 23rd. The Shandong situation is about to undergo a complete change.</p>
<h3>The Sino-Changchun Railway was Destroyed by Bandits, Causing a Loss of 10 Billion Circulation Coupons</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] During the fifth offensive by the bandit army in northern Songhua, the steel rails and sleepers of the Changwan section of the Sino-Changchun Railway were destroyed. The total value is estimated to be more than 10 billion yuan in circulation coupons. It is estimated that the railway, which is about 185 kilometers long from the north of Siping to Mengjiatun in the south of Kaiyuan, including 438,270 sleepers, 1,759 tons of steel rails, 4,627 telephone poles, and 19 station buildings and railway buildings along the line, were all blown up or burned down. According to the person in charge of the Sino-Changchun Railway here, in addition to searching for the materials needed to repair the damaged railway in the local area of Northeast China, a large number of sleepers have also been ordered from Taiwan.</p>
<h3>A Train on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway was Bombed, Ten Passengers were Killed and Injured</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 23rd] Another tragic incident occurred on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway where a passenger train was bombed. At 8:30 AM on the 23rd, a passenger train traveling from Tianjin to Tangfang collided with a landmine buried by 共匪 between Tangfang and Tianzhuang. Five third-class passenger cars were bombed and overturned, and three other cars derailed. Three passengers were killed and seven were injured. The damaged area can be repaired in 2-3 days.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Fu Zuoyi's Talk, Denies Meeting Wedemeyer</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 23rd] Fu Zuoyi denied to our reporter on the afternoon of the 23rd the rumors that he had met with General Wedemeyer on the evening of the 22nd. According to reports on the 23rd, Wei met with General Fu, Li Zongren, and Hu Zongnan on the evening of the 22nd. Fu stated that he did not yet know whether it was necessary to meet with Wei. He attended Xue Yue's banquet last night and talked at the Minister's official residence. Wei's news advisor, Watson, also did not confirm Wei's meeting with Fu, Li, and Hu.</p>
<h3>The Central Government Sends Personnel to Inspect the Mongol Banners</h3>
<p>Traitors Discovered in Otok Banner</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in GuiSui, 22nd] The Central Government is paying attention to the situation in the Mongol Banners and has sent He Zhaolin, Director of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's Office in Peiping, to GuiSui for inspection. He has arrived here.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in GuiSui, 22nd] More than 10,000 traitors have been discovered in Baini well, Otok Banner, and 3,000 traitors have been deployed on the south bank of the Hongliu River. Yang Senzhabu is preparing to go to Ningxia. Chairman Dong Qiwu ordered him to hold on firmly.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in GuiSui, 22nd] The Bandits have sent 150 cadres who are proficient in the Mongolian language to work in the Yikezhao League.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 23rd] It is heard that the Inner Mongolia Communist Party Working Committee has been established in Wangyemiao.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in GuiSui, 22nd] Fifty yurts were discovered at Hulachi Temple, 90 kilometers northeast of Taolin Tumuer Tai. It seems that the Mongolian Communists are holding an important meeting here. According to Mongolian people who escaped, there are six advisors from a certain country.</p>
<h3>Direct Train from Peiping to Baotou, Departs from Peiping for the First Time</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, GuiSui, 23rd] The first direct train from Peiping to Baotou has departed from Peiping, passing through Suiyuan to Baotou. In the future, direct trains between Peiping and Baotou will run once a week in both directions.</p>
<h3>Many People Have Resigned from Their Official Positions to Participate in the Election of Legislators</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 23rd] Many incumbent officials who participated in the election of legislators have resigned before July 20.

<h3>The U.S. Transferred Surplus Materials to Our Country, Totaling Nearly 500 Million U.S. Dollars, Washington Officially Announced</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The China and East Asia Office of the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission announced today that it has supplied China with approximately 170 million U.S. dollars worth of surplus materials, which is different from the report on May 31 this year. A State Department spokesman explained that the statement was in response to Ye Gongchao's statement, who said on June 4 that China had only received 20 million U.S. dollars worth of surplus materials, most of which were non-military trucks. The official statement said that the transfer was made in accordance with the terms of the large-scale sale stipulated in the August 30, 1946 agreement. Before signing the agreement, the U.S. government had transferred surplus materials worth approximately 324 million U.S. dollars to China at cost. The 500 million U.S. dollars worth of materials include various equipment, including trucks, construction equipment, clothing, food, and medicines, but aircraft, combat materials, ships, and other naval equipment are not included. These materials are located in mainland China and 17 islands in the Pacific Ocean (including Okinawa and Guam). By the end of May, the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau had obtained 59.7 million U.S. dollars worth of surplus materials. Due to transportation problems and various procedures, the speed at which the Chinese side accepted the materials was slower than that announced by the Liquidation Committee. This procedure has long been determined, and a large number of materials have already been transferred to China, but the speed of this transfer is now greatly increasing. According to this procedure, the transfer procedure is expected to be completed within the 22 months stipulated in the agreement.</p>

<h3>Economic Reform Plan Full Text (Continued from Yesterday's Second Edition)</h3>
<p>2.  Industry: Without rapidly building an industrial base, China's economy will not easily become sound. However, China's economy is based on agriculture, so without a self-sufficient people's livelihood industry to protect agriculture and ensure that agriculture and industry exchange and complement each other, the foundation of China's economy cannot be established. Therefore, the current development of people's livelihood industries should be combined with the equal importance of basic industries as an urgent plan. Therefore, the government urgently needs to improve the industrial environment, protect industrial profits, and ensure that funds are available and loans are convenient. At the same time, it should formulate a comprehensive plan and predetermine the annual output, and complete it in stages with the combined efforts of the government and the people. The methods are:</p>
<p>(1) Industry should first meet the needs of the rural areas. All industries related to water conservancy construction, engineering, chemicals, fertilizers, agricultural tools, and transportation equipment manufacturing should be planned and implemented first.</p>
<p>(2) In the initial stage of industrial development, emphasis should be placed on: (1) developing fuel and power, (2) developing various minerals, (3) producing cement and other construction materials, and (4) establishing machinery manufacturing factories to lay the foundation for industry.</p>
<p>(3) People's livelihood industries should start with the five major categories of food, clothing, housing, transportation, and printing. We should first focus on the existing foundation and give priority to the development of the textile industry, the food industry, and the mechanical and chemical industries related to the five categories of industries.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the scope of state-owned and private enterprises. In accordance with the First Phase Economic Construction Principles and Industrial Construction Guidelines Implementation Principles, classify and divide areas, briefly specify, and urge implementation.</p>
<p>(5) Industrial construction areas should be planned as a whole by the central government based on national economic conditions, transportation conditions, and resource distribution.</p>
<p>(6) The government should support and improve small industries (especially handicrafts) and their intermediary organizations, and enable the people to make full use of their spare time to engage in industrial production to meet domestic and international needs.</p>
<p>(7) In order to develop international trade and increase exports, the production of exported minerals, handicrafts, and processed agricultural products should be increased.</p>
<p>(8) The manufacturing of industrial products should strive for standardization.</p>
<p>(9) The government should organize and promote the establishment of various industrial and mining construction projects and investment companies to invest long-term funds in industrial and mining construction projects, and use overseas Chinese funds and foreign exchange assets deposited abroad to invest in this organization to purchase machinery and raw materials from abroad.</p>
<p>(10) Industrial and mining companies should be allowed to circulate their stocks in the market, and should be allowed to issue bonds, so that idle funds in the market can fully participate in legitimate production projects.</p>
<p>(11) Bank loans to industrial and mining enterprises should be supervised to ensure that they are actually used for production collateral, and fixed assets such as factory buildings and machinery should be accepted, not limited to raw materials and finished products.</p>
<p>(12) The fixed assets of industrial and mining enterprises should be allowed to be revalued and the capital adjusted when necessary.</p>
<p>(13) In order to promote the development of industry, the government should clearly define measures to encourage foreign investment and technical cooperation.</p>
<p>(14) Wages should strive to be reasonable in order to stabilize production order and enable labor and management to work together to increase production.</p>
<p>3.  Commerce: Trade deficit is a major disease of the national economy. The government should encourage exports with effective methods in order to gradually balance foreign trade. As for the stagnation of domestic commercial transportation and the heavy taxes, both can prevent goods from flowing smoothly, and market materials are becoming increasingly scarce, and commerce is becoming increasingly depressed. It is urgent to remove restrictions, encourage and punish, so that commerce can quickly return to normal. The methods are:</p>
<p>(1) Domestic trade should make full use of the coordination of financial institutions and the convenience of water, land, and air transportation to stimulate trade and promote the use of domestic goods to increase the total volume of trade in the country and promote balanced development.</p>
<p>(2) In international trade, imports should be strictly restricted as much as possible, except for production tools, raw materials, books, and instruments, in order to save unnecessary foreign exchange expenditures.</p>
<p>(3) Export affairs should be given encouragement. The government may purchase materials to facilitate exports, or designate certain items to be operated by import and export, so as to increase exports to offset imports.</p>
<p>(4) Assign the National Cooperative Goods Distribution Office to contact the International Cooperative Trade Committee of the International Cooperative Alliance and the National Wholesale Cooperative, and try the barter system at appropriate times.</p>
<p>(5) Strengthen the organization of industry associations to improve commercial technology, improve commercial ethics, and promote the implementation of the government's price control policies.</p>
<p>4.  Transportation: The transportation industry is a prerequisite for economic construction. After years of hard work before the war, it had already taken shape. However, after the long-term war of resistance and the destruction by the communist bandits, half of it was destroyed. In the future, the government and the people should work together according to the division of labor, and do their best to restore and develop the transportation industry, then the current phenomenon of economic paralysis can be greatly changed. The methods are:</p>
<p>(1) In addition to the railway lines planned and announced by the central government, local and private operations may be permitted and encouraged under the system established by the central government.</p>
<p>(2) In addition to the national highways planned, announced, and built by the central government, all others shall be permitted and encouraged for local and private operations under the standards set by the central government.</p>
<p>(3) Airports shall be operated by the government. After the preparations for airway construction, station equipment, and flight control are completed, private operations shall be encouraged as much as possible for air transport.</p>
<p>(4) The main waterways shall be dredged by the central government, the branch lines shall be dredged by the provinces, and the smallest branch lines shall be dredged by the counties. The important ports shall be operated by the central government, and the secondary ports shall be operated by the cities. All waterways and ports operated by the provinces and cities shall be assisted by the central government with financial and human resources. Shipping shall be encouraged for private operation as much as possible.</p>
<p>(5) Telegraphs shall be operated by the central government. Wireless stations specially needed for aviation and shipping in the sea and air shall be allowed to be set up by themselves under the management of the central government.</p>
<p>(6) Long-distance telephone trunk lines and inter-provincial lines shall be laid by the central government, and branch lines within each province shall be laid by the provinces, but shall not be parallel to the trunk lines or inter-provincial lines (the division of trunk lines and branch lines shall be determined by the central government), and county and township branch lines shall be laid by the counties.</p>
<p>(7) City telephones, except for those in municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan and provincial cities, which shall be handled or publicly operated by the central government, shall be encouraged for private operation in other counties, and measures shall be formulated to allow them to be connected to long-distance telephones.</p>
<p>(8) The government shall do its best to supervise and encourage the construction of various transportation projects and the manufacturing of transportation equipment. (The following text continues on the second edition)</p>

<h3>Full Text of Economic Reform Plan (Continued from above) (First Edition)</h3>
<p>V. Increase Production of Materials and Stabilize Prices: Currently, there is a shortage of materials and price fluctuations. The government urgently needs to increase production through economic methods and make appropriate use of them to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The government should provide agricultural production loans and adopt a procurement approach to promote the production of major agricultural raw materials such as rice, wheat, cotton, and soybeans, and utilize a portion or a large part of them.</p>
<p>(2) The government should supply raw materials to manufacturers, or provide industrial production loans, or adopt a procurement approach to promote the production of flour, cloth, oil, sugar, fuel, and other daily necessities, and utilize a portion or a large part of them.</p>
<p>(3) The government should provide export loans or adopt a procurement approach to promote the production and export of export products such as soybeans, raw silk, mineral sands, tung oil, hides and furs, tea, and pig bristles, in order to enrich foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>(4) In addition to the government's planned supply of daily necessities to military personnel and public educators, the surplus materials should be used for rationing and stabilizing prices according to the needs of cities, so that hoarding is impossible and the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods can be achieved.</p>
<p>(5) The government should negotiate loans of machinery and raw materials from foreign countries on preferential terms to increase the supply of materials.</p>
<p>(6) Enemy and puppet industrial and mining equipment in the country and factory equipment dismantled and returned from Japan as compensation, except for those necessary for state-owned enterprises, should be sold or leased as much as possible to capable and experienced private factories to restore and increase production as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(7) Interest rates exceeding the prescribed maximum rate of usury will not be protected and will be punished.</p>
<p>(8) Strictly crack down on speculation and manipulation in accordance with the National Mobilization Law.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding Finance</p>
<p>As production enterprises expand, fiscal revenue will naturally increase proportionally. The government should use effective methods to protect and support agricultural production to increase land tax revenue, protect and support industrial production to increase direct and commodity tax revenue, protect and support trade to increase customs revenue, and protect and support the salt industry to increase salt tax revenue, using the production capacity and total income of all the people to support the entire national finance. As for the various aspects of financial reform, they can be included in the two tasks of reorganizing finance and stabilizing the currency value. The detailed measures are listed below:</p>
<p>I. Reorganizing Finance:</p>
<p>(1) The financial revenue and expenditure system should be revised to increase provincial-level financial resources to achieve self-sufficiency. The statutory taxes of counties and cities should also be thoroughly reorganized, and illegal apportionments should be strictly prohibited, so that local finances can develop soundly and meet the needs of local construction.</p>
<p>(2) The tax rates of direct, commodity, customs, and salt taxes should be carefully adjusted according to the people's ability to pay taxes, in order to increase national treasury revenue and equalize the people's burden.</p>
<p>(3) New taxes should be opened up in accordance with the principle of "those with money should contribute" to meet the needs of national construction.</p>
<p>(4) Adjust the collection agencies, strictly control tax sources, and improve collection procedures to strengthen tax administration efficiency and reduce collection costs.</p>
<p>(5) Enemy and puppet industries and surplus materials should be sold quickly. State-owned enterprises that do not need to be operated by the government should be sold to private enterprises by issuing stocks or other means.</p>
<p>(6) Implement a public debt policy to absorb idle funds to make up for the gap between fiscal revenue and expenditure.</p>
<p>(7) Give priority to allowing people to apply to the Central Bank for foreign exchange with gold for the purpose of purchasing permitted imported goods.</p>
<p>(8) Determine the existence or abolition of agencies based on the needs of national construction. Overly large institutions must be streamlined; redundant institutions must be merged.</p>
<p>(9) Expenditures that are not urgently needed by the state and are not conducive to production and construction must be saved and stopped.</p>
<p>II. Stabilizing the Currency Value:</p>
<p>(1) The government should actively increase revenue and strictly limit unnecessary expenditures to gradually reduce the gap between fiscal revenue and expenditure, so as to control the amount of issuance.</p>
<p>(2) Use effective methods to delay the turnover rate of currency.</p>
<p>(3) The government should be fully prepared and choose an appropriate time to reorganize the currency system. The current special currency systems in Northeast China, Taiwan, and other regions should also be reorganized at the same time to achieve uniformity.</p>
<p>(4) Strengthen foreign exchange control and absorb overseas remittances to enrich foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>(5) The government should allow people to use gold to purchase state-owned production enterprises and enemy and puppet industries sold by the government to increase the reserve of legal currency.</p>
<p>(6) The assets of Chinese citizens abroad should be declared within a time limit and used properly.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In short, production enterprises cannot be without the nourishment of finance for a day, and fiscal revenue cannot be without the support of production enterprises for a day. Financial policy, economic policy, and fiscal policy are mutually causal and mutually supportive, and cannot be separated even for a moment. The provisions in this plan that have been implemented by the government but have not yet taken effect should be strengthened by the competent departments; those that should be implemented immediately and prepared for implementation should be assigned by the Executive Yuan to the competent departments to formulate detailed measures and implement them immediately. Secondly, in order to maximize the benefits of the implementation of this plan, three points should be especially noted: First, the treatment of military personnel and public educators should be reasonably resolved so that they can maintain a minimum necessary life, so that administrative efficiency can be improved. Second, state-owned enterprises and private enterprises should be on an equal footing, without any discrimination, and especially without giving special treatment to some private enterprises, which would increase difficulties for legitimate private businesses. Third, a broad economic construction movement should be launched in the social sphere to improve public understanding and interest in the economy, and the difficulties of economic construction should be eliminated with the cooperation of officials and the people. If the above-mentioned reform measures can be carried out in coordination, the current situation of economic recession, soaring prices, dwindling tax sources, and unbalanced income can be changed immediately. It is hoped that there will be many producers and few consumers, quick workers and comfortable users, so that wealth will always be sufficient, and the crisis in finance and economy can be saved.

<h3>Editorial: A Discussion on the Adoption of the Ordering System</h3>
<p>—One of the Reviews of the Economic Reform Plan</p>
<p>Regarding the matters of increasing production and stabilizing prices, the original plan of the Executive Yuan's economic reform has provisions for promoting agriculture, industry, and commerce through loans or adopting ordering methods; and the amendment of the Economic Commission has not modified this. Once this plan is passed by the State Council, all industries belonging to agriculture, industry, and export will have the possibility of implementing this purchasing method on a large scale.</p>
<p>The so-called ordering method, its implementation methods, still need to be formulated separately. Its meaning and scope are currently impossible to grasp. Judging by intention, it should be no more than following the precedents of raw silk and frozen eggs, designating institutions to specialize in purchasing. Its meaning is equivalent to bulk ordering, and it is very likely that a certain percentage of the payment will be made in advance to facilitate turnover; however, the scope is larger, and the percentage may be higher. There are ten advantages to using this method:</p>
<p>I. The payment is conditional on the delivery of physical goods, so it cannot be arbitrarily diverted to speculation and hoarding;</p>
<p>II. Since it is conditional on the delivery of physical goods, it seems to be able to promote production effectively;</p>
<p>III. If the manufacturer sells the goods in advance, as long as the calculation is accurate in advance, there is no loss;</p>
<p>IV. Because the goods delivered are physical goods, and they are the products produced by the other party, there is no unexpected risk for the ordering agency;</p>
<p>V. It is possible to obtain unexpected benefits due to the rise in prices;</p>
<p>VI. The state can grasp a large amount of materials and can use them to stabilize prices;</p>
<p>VII. These materials can also be used to promote the rationing policy;</p>
<p>VIII. Since the manufacturer has sold the goods in advance, they can be relieved of concerns about unsalable or falling prices;</p>
<p>IX. If it belongs to export products, all procedures and profits and losses related to export can be borne by the purchasing agency, which has nothing to do with the exporter;</p>
<p>X. If it is agreed to deliver the goods at the factory or on the spot, the manufacturer can ignore the labor costs such as transportation, water freight, insurance, and warehousing.</p>
<p>The above ten points refer specifically to the advantages of the ordering aspect; the reverse side also has shortcomings or concerns, which are listed below:</p>
<p>According to normal theory, the so-called ordering price cannot but adopt the method of agreement. There must always be one party willing to buy and one party willing to sell; only then can the transaction be successfully concluded. However, judging from examples, all government purchases of materials often unintentionally carry a few unreasonable colors; making producers have to make compromises under certain circumstances in order to comply with the conditions it offers. The prices of cotton yarn purchases in the past, as well as the prices of silkworm cocoons and cotton, have all escaped this example. Therefore, the people who handle the purchase also often try to be fair and reasonable and prevent farmers from suffering too much. Now, if we carry out various ordering on a large scale, will it be too suppressed, making producers unable to reproduce? Farmers, with no profit to be made, would rather let the fields be barren? This is one.</p>
<p>When the government sells materials, such as gold, cloth, sugar, and coal, its prices often follow the black market, giving people the criticism of leading price increases. If a large amount of materials are received through ordering, then the quantity of materials it grasps is even greater, and the scope of its operation is even wider; the result is, does it stabilize prices? Or is it leading price increases? This also remains to be proven by facts. This is two.</p>
<p>Government-run businesses must pay attention to various procedures; the bigger the thing, the more complicated it is, and the heavier the delay. In the past, many enemy and puppet materials and relief materials became moldy and unusable because of these reasons. Taking that as an example, I am afraid that no one dares to guarantee that they will not repeat this mistake in the future. This is three.</p>
<p>The so-called ordering method may have to start from mass production and special products, which is indeed unavoidable due to technical and strength conditions. If the ordering method is held at the same time as other methods (such as various types of loans now), there is no problem. If, after this plan is implemented, various loans are restricted and this ordering method is emphasized, then production enterprises with a smaller scope and various products not within the ordering scope will inevitably be affected. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, requesting it to carefully consider the matter of stopping commercial lending and not implement it; it can be seen that its relationship is significant. This is four.</p>
<p>All large-scale purchases are very likely to create a monopoly phenomenon; making it impossible for other aspects to compete or share the profits with it. Not long ago, we heard that many small oil factories in the interior had already encountered this problem with a certain kind of oil-making raw material. Recently, silk merchants have also requested to retain 20%. After this ordering method is widely promoted, how to plan to take care of both sides and prevent producers outside these scopes from being affected by various disadvantages is also worth studying. This is five.</p>
<p>Whether it is raw materials or finished products, there must be many intermediate merchants between them before they reach retailers or consumers. They move, match, deposit, and distribute in the middle, each fulfilling its task of transshipment. Although most of these tasks are interpreted as exploitation, profiteering, speculation, and hoarding, it is okay to eliminate them as much as possible, but the number of people who make a living by this and engage in this business is also quite a lot. At a time when there are many unemployed and life is difficult, the result of direct purchase and sale adds many unemployed people, making them unable to operate. From the perspective of the entire society, this cannot be said to be a serious problem. This is six.</p>
<p>The worst losses are still the majority of farmers, because their units are too small, their output is limited, and they are still unable to use various cooperative mutual aid organizations. As the preamble to the amendment says, the agricultural loans of various banks are currently very small and do not help, which is indeed the case. Therefore, in terms of agricultural products, the so-called benefits of loans and ordering cannot be obtained by farmers. This is seven. Finally, we must talk about the issue of ordering itself, which is the issue of currency supply. Many people think that raising money by printing machines, how much is needed, seems to be no need to worry about. In fact, printing machines also have their own factual limitations, and they are not予取予求, can be whatever you want. It is heard that this serious problem was encountered during the recent cocoon collection, which caused a lot of trouble. If the ordering method is widely adopted, the amount of cash required will be considerable. Regardless of whether the supply can be sufficient, whether the agricultural, industrial, and export industries can each get what they need and satisfy their wishes; but after the currency continues to expand, can prices be stabilized? If there is too much concern and too much caution, will the effectiveness of this ordering method in promoting the agricultural, industrial, and export industries be greatly reduced! This is eight.</p>
<p>Everything has its advantages and disadvantages, and there is no abacus in the world that is completely satisfactory. This plan has many advantages and has been carefully considered. As long as the State Council approves it, it can be implemented. We naturally hope that it will be promoted smoothly and can achieve the maximum effect of increasing the production of materials and stabilizing materials. However, the hidden worries and the thorns ahead must also be carefully prevented and prepared for early. For example, when a doctor uses medicine, the possible reactions should be considered in advance and minimized as much as possible, so as not to cause accidents. Fortunately, the plan sets only a principle: Which industries and products must be ordered first? What is the limit of the ordering? What are the conditions? What will be done after the ordering? How to take care of those who are not prepared to order? We believe that the government must have detailed considerations and a complete set of plans for these technical issues. Because this is a fundamental national plan, it is different from the expedient measures of dealing with things as they come in the past; it will never be fragmented, "only paying attention to the remedy of temporary difficulties"; and it will never just make small calculations, focusing solely on profit and loss.</p>

<h3>Coal Mine Nationalization Case Still at an Impasse; Japanese Cabinet Crisis Intensifies; Conflicting Opinions Among the Three Parties; Consultation Ends Without Result</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The consultation meeting among the three parties of the Japanese cabinet to discuss the coal mine nationalization case was held at 1:00 p.m. on the 23rd, making a comparative study of the government's draft nationalization bill and the three parties' production increase countermeasures. However, regarding the nationalization case, whether it would help increase coal production, the opinions of the government and the Socialist Party were sharply opposed to those of the Democratic Party, so the meeting ended without result. The fate of this issue is expected to be known by the middle of this month.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Regarding the coal mine nationalization issue, the Japanese Liberal Party plans to convene a coal committee on the 25th after the members currently conducting on-site investigations in Hokkaido and Kyushu return to Tokyo, to determine the party's final attitude. Uehara, the chairman of the coal mine countermeasures committee, who returned to Tokyo after inspecting various coal mines in Kyushu, said on the 22nd: "Regarding the nationalization of coal mines, the capitalists are absolutely opposed. As for the opinions of the workers, I have heard them in various places, but there is no firm belief in supporting nationalization. In short, if the funding problem can be resolved, I am confident that the desired production target can be achieved without implementing nationalization."</p>
<h3>US and Soviet Representatives on Control Committee for Japan Debate Japanese Land Reform Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] Soviet representative Lieutenant General Derevyanko attacked the Japanese land reform plan on the 23rd, saying that at best it was only an incomplete measure, and even the attempt to distribute land to farmers was hindered. At the meeting of the Control Committee for Japan on the morning of the 23rd, Derevyanko had a heated debate with Chairman Acheson. Derevyanko said: "According to the figures presented, the entire result, from a democratic standpoint, is unsatisfactory." He attacked the Japanese farmers for giving up their right to vote in this major effort due to [reasons not specified]. Acheson resolutely defended this policy. The Soviet representative quoted figures from the "Oriental Economist" newspaper, intending to show that Japan's original policy intended to transfer 1,225,000 acres of land to farmers, but to date not a single acre of land has been sold to farmers. Therefore, I cannot admit that the reform has been successfully implemented.</p>
<p>Acheson ordered Hughes, an agricultural specialist from the Allied Headquarters, to refute the attack that this plan had failed. Hughes pointed out that the Japanese government had purchased 336,000 acres of land on July 2 for resale to tenant farmers. 316,000 acres were acquired before March 31. In addition, 659,000 acres were requisitioned by the government in lieu of taxes and are available for distribution to tenant farmers.</p>
<h3>Liberal Party Members Detained in Japanese Hidden Goods Incident</h3>

All those who have been arrested or are under investigation are related to the five million yen worth of materials hidden and associated with a certain political party.</p>
<h3>Arab Representatives State Their Views; Oppose the Establishment of a Jewish State; and Demand Full Implementation of Self-Determination</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Beirut, 22nd] Lebanese Foreign Minister Frank, speaking on behalf of six countries, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, presented his views to the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, demanding that the immigration of Jews into Palestine be stopped immediately. He also believed that Zionist factions were plotting to launch violence in Transjordan, Syria, and Lebanon. He submitted a memorandum to the UN Investigation Committee, stating the threat to the autonomy of the Arab race and the peace of the Middle East, and the Arab governments demanded the immediate and full implementation of self-determination. Now, Zionist factions have established secret army organizations to engage in destructive actions. These activities are bound to cause the Arab side to engage in similar organizations to repel Jewish aggression, which will cause turmoil in the Middle East and harm the position of the Jewish race in the entire Arab world. Frank also stated that if the Jewish race achieves the goal of establishing a state, the Arab countries will implement political and economic boycotts, and the partition plan of Palestine is sufficient to complicate the situation. The Arabs put forward a compromise suggestion, that every Jew who has legally obtained Palestinian citizenship should have equal rights and obligations, and that an independent government should be established in proportion to representation.</p>
<h3>Important Soviet Representatives in the United States All Have Secret Missions; Kravchenko Testifies Before US House Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] Former Soviet Purchasing Commission official in the United States, Kravchenko, told the US House Committee on Un-American Activities: "Every responsible Soviet representative in the United States can be regarded as an economic or political spy." Kravchenko appeared today as a key witness at the committee's hearing. The hearing aims to find evidence to arrest the fifth column operating in the United States.</p>
<p>Kravchenko defected from the Communist Party last year and announced the activities of the Communist Party in a widely distributed book titled "I Chose Freedom". He described how Soviet agents gathered secret information about American aviation and submarine aspects, as well as other documents. He accused the Communist Party of promoting policies in the United States to create chaos, disputes, and strikes in order to weaken American power until the United States could not oppose Soviet foreign policy. Kravchenko said: "Only the United States can stop Soviet aggression." He predicted that if Stalin died recently, Molotov might succeed Stalin, but his policies would be the same. He also accused the Soviet Union of seeming to prefer its vassal states to suffer from hunger rather than participate in American relief programs. He warned that the Communist accomplices in the United States were even more dangerous than the true Communists, and claimed that "Chicago Sun" publisher Field was more dangerous than 30% of the well-known members of the Communist Party, and that the trouble he personally caused to the United States would be more than that caused by the people of the Communist Party. Kravchenko admitted that he actively studied the problem of uranium refining in the Soviet Union in 1942. He also warned that the Soviet Union is doing its best to manufacture atomic bombs. He estimated that there are 3.5 million members of the Soviet Communist Party, with another 2.5 million probationary members and 10 million young Communist Party members.</p>

Most of the princely states will become an integral part of the Dominion of India, and the powers that must be exercised centrally, such as national defense, diplomacy, and transportation, will be exercised by the Indian federal authorities. The details of this merger are still under study and are expected to undergo significant revisions before being approved by the princes.</p>
<h3>Chinese Painting Exhibition Held in Geneva; Visitors Are Extremely Enthusiastic</h3>

In addition, ancient Chinese paintings are also displayed, including a painting called "Surprise on the Rock," which is a genuine work by Emperor Song Zong.</p>
<h3>American Journalist Group Arrives in Seoul</h3>

<h3>British Fleet Visits Turkey, No Less Than Reaffirming the Anglo-Turkish Alliance</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 22nd] Regarding the visit of the British Navy fleet to Turkish territorial waters today, well-informed sources here commented: This visit is no less than a reaffirmation of the Anglo-Turkish alliance. The Anglo-Turkish treaty was signed in 1939 and is the only alliance treaty between Turkey and a foreign country that exists today and has not lost its effect or value. The British fleet's visit to Turkey is purely an ordinary visit and does not have any political effect. Turkey's invitation to the British fleet to visit Turkey can be interpreted as meaning that although the country currently relies on the United States in practice, it is still equally loyal to the Anglo-Turkish alliance treaty. The British Navy fleet visiting the Bosphorus Strait is commanded by Admiral Willis, Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet.</p>
<h3>Three American Warships Arrive on the French Riviera</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nice, 22nd] The American cruiser "Tington" and the destroyers "Conyngham" and "Gaynard" arrived on the French Riviera today and anchored in Villefranche harbor.</p>
<h3>British King Reviews Fleet</h3>
<p>The Grandeur Is Only Seen Once in Ten Years</p>
<p>[United Press, Glasgow, 22nd] The British royal family, accompanied by Naval Captain Mountbatten and Mr. and Mrs. Attlee, reviewed the domestic fleet in the Firth of Clyde on the 22nd. There were a large number of warships participating in the review, from battleships and aircraft carriers to submarines and landing craft, totaling 109 ships, which was the only time it had been seen since the coronation ceremony of the British King in 1937. As the British royal family conducted the review, the British Navy fired a 21-gun salute in tribute.</p>
<h3>US Congress Plans to Form Mixed Committee to Go to Europe to Investigate the Economy; US Aid to Europe May Exceed 2.3 Billion Dollars</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] The House of Representatives passed a provisional motion today advocating that a mixed committee of 19 members from the House and Senate be organized to go to Europe to investigate the economic situation of various countries during the Congressional recess. The American military occupation zone in Germany and Austria are also included, and estimate the needs of European countries in order to implement Secretary of State Marshall's aid to Europe plan. Among them, some of the representatives are members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, bankers, financiers, and senior military officials from the Army and Navy.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] According to Washington news: American aid to Europe in accordance with the Marshall Plan may exceed 2.3 billion US dollars, for a period of one year, and if the plan proceeds smoothly, funds will continue to be allocated. However, President Truman recently told Congress that even with the European aid plan, American exports are expected to begin to decrease next year.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] Those in charge here say that one of the major controversial issues raised during the Paris Economic Conference was the issue of offsetting accounts. It is extremely difficult for the sixteen countries participating in the conference to balance their budgets in the short term. Under these circumstances, it is generally believed that the finances of the British and American merged zone in Germany do not need to be stabilized immediately. When European countries, especially Britain, are unable to balance their budgets, it is not only unfair but also dangerous to give huge financial benefits to other countries.</p>
<h3>US Congress Will Form Near East Inspection Team</h3>

<h3>American Commissioner to Austria Accuses Soviet Army of Kidnapping Citizens</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] In a report submitted to the War Department, the US High Commissioner to Austria, Keyes, accused individuals in Soviet army uniforms of kidnapping citizens on the streets of Vienna. In June, ten people disappeared in Vienna in this way, mostly nationals of Soviet-controlled countries. Although the official US military report did not mention it, various newspapers have reported it in detail and it has been confirmed by sources who could be relied upon. The High Commissioner's report also stated: The Allied Control Council originally allowed those with passes to cross the borders of the occupation zones. However, the Soviet side broke this agreement without explanation, preventing those with passes from entering or leaving the Soviet zone. Keyes believes that the purpose of the Soviet move is to prevent political refugees from fleeing into the British and American occupation zones.</p>

<h3>Security Council Continues to Discuss Balkan Situation Passes Preface to US Proposal</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 22nd] Regarding the Greek question, the United States previously proposed reorganizing the United Nations Balkan Investigative Committee, but after the Soviet Union firmly opposed it, the Security Council continued to discuss it.

<h3>Britain and France Agree on Opposing Raising German Industrial Standards Bidault Says France's Policy Toward Germany Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] Well-informed sources here said today: The United States may maintain its intention to promote a military alliance to prevent possible future German aggression, but it is definitely not like the proposal recently circulated in Washington to form an equal treaty between France and the United States. When the London Foreign Ministers' Conference is held in November this year, the United States may raise the issue of a four-nation security treaty again. At this time, if the proposal of an equal treaty or a three-nation treaty is put forward, it will greatly affect the success of the four-nation treaty. Furthermore, France does not want to increase Germany's industrial production significantly at the expense of granting priority to countries invaded by Germany to restore their steel industries. In other words, Germany can only retain the lowest level of steel mills and foundries. Currently, in the battle over German industrial standards, Britain and France seem to be united in dealing with the United States. British Foreign Secretary Bevin once said: Significantly raising German industrial standards will endanger security. On the other hand, representatives of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee believe that such fears are not appropriate, and Germany's industry is necessary for European reconstruction. However, due to France's firm attitude, this issue may be resolved by some compromise.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] French Foreign Minister Bidault told the Senate today that France's policy toward Germany has not changed in the slightest. The Senate is currently discussing the transfer of the administration of the French zone in Germany to ordinary administrative bodies.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] Regarding the revision of German industrial standards, officials have recently announced that it has been decided to temporarily postpone the implementation. At the request of Foreign Secretary Bevin, the British Cabinet will hold a meeting tomorrow to review the possibility of holding a meeting between Britain and the United States to discuss German industrial standards. This meeting was initiated by the US government and will now be expanded in scope, including other issues in addition to the coal issue. France will also participate in the meeting.</p>

It is heard that the British delegation considers the price of wheat offered by the Soviet Union unacceptable, and the British delegation may return to London in the short term.</p>
<h3>US-Soviet Joint Commission Continues Meeting To Negotiate List of Korean Political Groups to Participate Hodge Expresses Sorrow Over Death of Lyuh Woon-Hyung</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 23rd] The forty-fifth meeting of the US-Soviet Joint Commission was held yesterday afternoon at 1:30 p.m. At the meeting, negotiations began on the list of political parties and organizations to participate in the conference. The meeting will continue tomorrow afternoon at 1:30 p.m. and the incomplete list will be decided.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 23rd] Lieutenant General Hodge issued the following statement today regarding the assassination of Lyuh Woon-Hyung: The assassination of Mr. Lyuh is a great loss to Korea. The Korean people long for freedom and independence, but some politicians only seek personal political power, resulting in assassination, which is very regrettable. In order to resolve the Korean crisis, we are convening an international conference. We hope that the Korean people should seize this good opportunity and redouble their efforts to promote the success of the conference. It must be known that violent actions are of no avail. Only by abandoning violent actions and obeying democratic rules can we hope to achieve results.</p>

<h3>Be Vigilant Against Japan's Economic Offensive Shao Yulin Discusses the Peace Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>[Exclusive Interview by New Asia News Agency] In recent days, issues such as the peace treaty with Japan and trade with Japan have become imminent. Our reporter specially visited Mr. Shao Yulin, a well-known authority on Far Eastern issues and executive director of the East Asia Association, who recently came to Shanghai from Nanjing. He was asked about his opinions on the principles and attitude towards the peace treaty with Japan, the timing and location of the treaty, the issue of compensation, the issue of trade with Japan, the issue of Japanese debts, and the recent preliminary consultation meeting on the peace treaty with Japan convened by the United States. Mr. Shao spoke freely and said: After I arrived in Shanghai this time, I exchanged opinions with many experts on Japanese issues, such as Wang Yunsheng, Xu Yiqiao, Liu Baimin, Cui Geqiu, Meng Xianzhang, Song Yuelun, Li Qiusheng, Fang Qiuhou, Zhao Nanrou, Liu Juenong, and Zhou Changshou. Now, I will summarize the opinions of various experts and my personal opinions and answer them one by one: We believe that the fundamental principle of the peace treaty with Japan is that, in addition to being based on the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, Japan's armed forces must be thoroughly disarmed so that Japan will never be able to invade again. Politically, it must be democratic, and economically, it must be prevented from harming China and the world. Among the military, political, and economic issues, the economic issue is the most important, because economic power is combat power. Although Japan is under the control of the Allied forces and cannot launch a military offensive, the threat of its "economic offensive" is already facing us.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of compensation, some people only pay attention to how to destroy Japan's heavy industry, but fail to take into account the possible economic offensive of Japan's light industry. From our country's standpoint, backward heavy industrial equipment is of no benefit to the current and future economic construction. In order to remedy the fact that demolishing old heavy industrial equipment has no practical benefit to us, we should propose a request for cash compensation and production compensation. Some factories for production compensation should also be designated as compensation items and kept for future relocation, otherwise it will only increase Japan's productivity. As for the issue of trade with Japan, I sympathize with the proposal to stop opening trade with Japan and stop sending commercial representatives, but I don't think it is necessary. The latter is only for exchanging and collecting trade information, and its trade behavior must be approved by our government and MacArthur Headquarters. The United States has opened up Japan's foreign trade in order to reduce the burden and maintain Japan's minimum living standards, so its opening up is inevitable. For the sake of our national industry and foreign markets, we should also actively try to guide and restrict it, such as the Sino-Japanese trade method, tariff system, and even export agreements or understandings. The government should also have the right to make overall adjustments to the interests of exporters and importers, national industries, and consumers. When talking about the issue of Japanese territory, Mr. Shao advocated that "Japan is the Japan of the Japanese," meaning that only the territories originally owned by the Japanese nation and not obtained by aggression are Japanese territories. The issue of the Ryukyu Islands can be handled by China and the United States concluding a trusteeship agreement in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Finally, Mr. Shao also talked about the procedures and rules of procedure for the preliminary consultation meeting on the peace treaty with Japan convened by the United States this time, saying that he does not insist on opposing the preliminary consultation on the peace treaty with Japan being changed from the four foreign ministers to the Far Eastern Commission or the current eleven-nation conference. However, if our country's veto power is abandoned and a two-thirds majority voting method is used, under the current international situation and for the sake of our country's interests, it should be carefully considered. I believe the authorities will handle it well. Finally, he said that he agrees with the United States and the authorities to advance the timing of the peace treaty with Japan, but he and his friends unanimously oppose the proposal of some Allied personnel to make Tokyo the location of the peace treaty.</p>
<h3>Japan's Ambitions Are Becoming More and More Obvious Newspapers Repeatedly Issue Calls for "Living Space" Hokkaido Assembly Asks Soviet Union to Return Three Islands</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd] Not many days after the proposal to convene a preliminary meeting on the Japanese peace treaty was announced, Japanese newspapers have issued calls for living space. The Yomiuri Shimbun and the English-language Japan Times have successively published articles by Japanese entrepreneur Aoki, mentioning the "deprivation" of Japan's foreign land and the crowding of 75 million people on the Japanese mainland. After mentioning the "China Incident" and the "Manchurian Incident," the author pointed out that Japan's pre-war territory included Korea, southern Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands, and the South Pacific Islands, and at that time, Japan's population was still less than 65 million. He continued: Today, Japan has not only been "deprived" of foreign land, but its increased population has to be confined to the mainland, and its production capacity is less than half of what it was before. The author continued to ask: How much space will Japan's current production capacity have for exports? The solution he proposed is to work hard. Since this article has appeared in Japanese newspapers twice, it means that it has passed the news check of the Allied Headquarters twice. Most of the British expats are deeply concerned and uneasy about the aforementioned proposal to work hard to solve the problem, and believe that it is a smokescreen for the author to conceal the true purpose of the article.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The Hokkaido Assembly of Japan has decided to ask MacArthur to return to Japan the three islands off the eastern coast of Hokkaido that are currently occupied by the Soviet army. According to the assembly, these three islands are rich in marine products, and if they are returned to Japan, they will greatly benefit the relief of food shortages.</p>

<h3>How Shanghai Cooperates with the General Mobilization Order The Mayor Received Instructions in Nanjing Took Kirk's Private Plane Back After Visiting the Chairman Yesterday The Central Government Decided to Subsidize the City Budget Due to Insufficiency</h3>
<p>[Our News] Mayor Wu was summoned by Chairman Chiang via telegram and took the night express train to Nanjing the night before last. After meeting with Chairman Chiang, he took Admiral Kirk's private plane back here at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. In addition to Admiral Kirk, the driver who came to Shanghai also included Zhang Peter, head of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Municipal Government, and others. The private plane arrived at Jiangwan Airport at 3:50 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>After getting off the plane, the mayor went straight back to his official residence on Anfu Road to rest. According to him, the purpose of this trip was purely to report on the price situation in the city, because it had been more than a month since he last went to Nanjing, and the Chairman was very concerned about the living conditions in Shanghai. According to Wu, the Chairman has given some instructions on how Shanghai should cooperate after the promulgation of the General Mobilization Order. As for the rumor that Mayor Wu's trip to Nanjing this time was related to Special Envoy Weidemaier, Wu has denied it yesterday. He also dismissed the saying that Wu will serve as the ambassador to the United States as unfounded. It is said that there will absolutely not be any changes in personnel.</p>
<h3>Tian Yongqian and Min Xiangfan Return to Shanghai After Finishing Official Business</h3>
<p>Tian Yongqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, and Min Xiangfan, Director of the Accounting Office of the Municipal Government, went to Nanjing together last week to ask the central government to approve the supplementary budget for the city government's deficit in the 36th year and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after finishing their official business. Reporters interviewed Director Tian and Director Min separately yesterday afternoon to inquire about this trip. As a result, it is said that this trip to Nanjing was in response to a telegram from the Ministry of Finance. The main thing was to discuss the budget issue of the city in the 36th year. After going to Nanjing, they first visited the Accounting Office of the Executive Yuan and frequently contacted and negotiated with the Local Finance Department of the Ministry of Finance. The original intention of the Ministry of Finance was to balance the city's revenue and expenditure budget, and planned to increase the revenue part appropriately. After repeated negotiations, they were fortunate to understand the local plight. As for the results of this trip to Nanjing, the more important ones are about four points: (1) The central government has decided in principle to provide subsidies to the city. This is an appropriation, and it can continue to be requested when civil servants' salaries are adjusted in the future. (2) The 30% of the business tax that should be allocated to the central government may be completely allocated to the city. According to reporters, according to the budget figures, about 24 billion yuan can be added each year.</p>
<p>Special Business Tax to be Implemented from July</p>
<p>(3) The starting date for the special business tax can also be accepted in principle as the original star of the Finance Bureau, please change it to be implemented from July 1. Director Tian repeatedly emphasized this point, not to fight for income, but entirely to facilitate merchants and improve the tax system. (4) The housing donation regulations stipulate that self-used houses that do not exceed one room per person are exempt from donation. This article can also be transferred for amendment. In short, the central government's perception of the city is that the city is an area where wealth is concentrated, and it is more difficult to request subsidies than in other places. However, after many efforts this time, the results are not yet satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Industrial Workers' Military Service Issue The General Federation of Trade Unions Plans to Request Postponement The Issue of Dismissal Pay Also Becomes the Focus of Discussion Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors to be Held Today</h3>
<p>[Our News] The Municipal General Federation of Trade Unions is scheduled to hold the eighth joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the fifth session at 4:00 p.m. today. It is reported that the central issues to be discussed at today's meeting will be three (1) The issue of military service for industrial workers. The General Federation of Trade Unions believes that under the General Mobilization Order, frontline troops are indeed important, but rear production cannot be ignored either, and it is planned to request a postponement of conscription. (2) Workers' income tax, which was previously approved by the authorities to be exempt from taxation, has recently been heard that the Direct Taxation Bureau is planning to levy it again, and the labor community unanimously demands continued exemption. (3) Dismissal issue. The Municipal Labor-Management Evaluation Committee has agreed that workers who have served for more than three years should be paid dismissal pay by the employer, up to three months and at least half a month. It is now heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association have asked the Ministry of Social Affairs for instructions, and it has been said that they have received a reply from the Ministry of Social Affairs, confirming that the dismissal issue should be handled in accordance with the Factory Law. According to the Factory Law, workers can be dismissed, but they must be notified one month in advance, and there is no provision for dismissal pay. Therefore, workers believe that this issue is very serious. If the Factory Law is followed, workers' jobs will not be guaranteed at all, and neither the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau nor the General Federation of Trade Unions has received this decree, so it will be discussed in detail at today's meeting.</p>
<h3>Railroad Bureau Uses New Cars for Third and Fourth Class Cars on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line</h3>
<p>[Our News] The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Administration previously used tarpaulin cars instead of third and fourth class mixed military cars due to a lack of cars.

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Zhe Ship Hits Stone Near Xiamen No Danger of Sinking But Need to Barge Out Glass Sand</h3>
<p>[Our News] China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Zhe Ship sailed from Shanghai to Guangdong on the 5th of this month, carrying goods, and also to Xiamen, Taiwan. On the return trip, it sailed to Axe Bay, ten miles away from Xiamen, to load glass sand to Shanghai. The place is located east of Xiamen, between Jinmen Island and Huating Island, west of Axe Bay, and no ships have ever sailed there. The captain of the Hai Zhe Ship hired a pilot because he was unfamiliar with the route there. After being fully loaded with glass sand on the 22nd, it set sail back to Shanghai. At noon, it unexpectedly touched a stone on the bottom of the sea due to shallow water and heavy ship, causing damage to all five cabins before and after. Seawater entered the ship. After learning about it, the captain dropped anchor and stopped sailing, and sent a telegram to Shanghai to report. It is heard that although there is no danger of sinking, it is urgent to barge out the sand. After the damaged part is repaired, it can return to Shanghai. Yesterday evening, the bureau received a report from the captain of the Hai Zhe Ship again.

<h3>Wu Guozhang's Case Concluded, Judgment Scheduled for the 30th</h3>
<p>[Our News] Wu Guozhang, husband of former actress Zhou Manhua, was accused of aiding the enemy with cotton. The case was concluded in the High Court yesterday, and the judgment is scheduled for the 30th of this month. Wu wore a light gray vanadium suit yesterday. According to his confession: Pudong Yuansheng Cotton Mill was opened by his brother Wu Guoxin. Maocheng Cotton Firm was established in the 31st year with a capital of 20 million Central Reserve Certificates. He only invested 2 million yuan and was elected as the manager. The cotton was sold to the same industry and was responsible by brokers. In the 34th year, 500 loads of cotton were sold to Yoshida Yoko, handled by a Mr. Ye. The goods were delivered in two batches, with a price of 200,000 Central Reserve Certificates per load, totaling 100 million Central Reserve Certificates. The court asked, "Do you know that cotton is a military supply! The raw material for making explosives?" Wu replied that merchants do not understand. The court asked, "After the victory, you had a large amount of enemy property cotton. Have you handed it over to the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau completely?" He replied, "It has been handed over." Then the defense lawyer claimed: In the indictment, the name of Colonel Sasaki of Yoshida Yoko appears, which seems to be a soldier. In fact, "Colonel" is a mistake for "Daizo", who is a Japanese businessman. Therefore, the difference in one word is quite large, so he applied for correction. Also, cotton is a military supply, and only those with specialized knowledge can know it. The defendant is a merchant and cannot understand it. At the end of the court debate, the date of the judgment was scheduled. After meeting with his family, he was sent back to prison.</p>
<h3>No Action Detrimental to the People Huang Zhenshi Not Guilty</h3>

The case was concluded in the High Court yesterday, and the judgment is scheduled for the 30th of this month. Wu admitted that he had served in a puppet position, saying that it was because of his popularity that he was spotted by the enemy army and forced to serve as the puppet district chief. As for the crimes accused in the indictment, they are all untrue. He claimed that unemployed vagrants borrowed money unsuccessfully and filed false accusations out of spite. After the trial, he was still sent back to prison.</p>
<h3>Application for Exemption from Military Service for Conscripts Expected to be Completed on the 29th</h3>
<p>[Our News] The city is handling the application for exemption from military service for conscripts, which is currently being rushed by the military section of the Civil Affairs Office, supervising the Baojia in each district. This work can be completed on the 29th of this month. Yesterday, according to Section Chief Yao of the section: The 3,000 military conscripts in the city will be filled by volunteers as much as possible. If there are not enough volunteers, the conscripts selected by lottery will be used to supplement them. However, before the lottery, matters such as the preparation of barracks equipment, the raising of resettlement fees, and the care of new recruits must be properly planned, and the conscription procedures (including the application and review of exemption from military service) must be completed. Otherwise, when military service is conscripted, disputes will inevitably arise, leading to difficulties. In addition, it was learned from the Military Service Association that the Association's preferential treatment and publicity committees will hold a meeting recently to discuss raising resettlement fees for conscripts and military service publicity issues.</p>

<h3>A Promise Leads to a Dispute Managers of Two Pharmacies Fight to the Point of Bleeding</h3>
<p>[Our News] Zhang Changjing, manager of the Huaying Pharmacy at the mouth of Fujian Road Huajin Lane and a native of Jiading, recently bid for the entire factory base of the Japanese Kuroda Pharmacy from the Enemy Property Processing Bureau for a price of 100 million yuan.

<h3>Bicycles Not Exchanging for New Licenses: Punished According to Law If Caught</h3>

<h3>Ten Thousand Yuan Military Aid Movement: City Divided into Thirty Districts; Comprehensive Promotion Scheduled; Fundraising Based on Voluntary Participation; Exchange Military Aid Coupons on the Spot After Donation</h3>
<p>Since the various sectors of this city launched the Ten Thousand Yuan Military Aid Movement to suppress the communists and build the nation, the enthusiasm has been very high. Various parties have been paying money to the municipal government and municipal party headquarters for military aid and inquiring about donation procedures. According to the person in charge of the conference: The fundraising work in this city was originally scheduled to start on the 21st, but it was changed to the 27th of this month due to the careful procedures for printing military aid coupons and stamping war records. The methods are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The fundraising targets are based on regions. The city is divided into 30 districts for implementation. Each district will form a fundraising subcommittee, with the chairman of the district representative assembly serving as the chairman, the district chief serving as the vice-chairman, and representatives of senators, party members, farmers, workers, and women serving as fundraising committee members. (2) The fundraising time for each urban area district is from July 27 to August 2. The fundraising time for each suburban district is from July 27 to August 5, and all donations must be submitted to the City Bank for settlement by August 6. (3) The fundraising principle is that each household is expected to donate at least 10,000 yuan, but it is based on voluntary participation and does not adopt apportionment methods. Poor households can also be exempted from fundraising. (4) Fundraising procedures: The conference printed five types of military aid coupons, divided into 10,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, 100,000 yuan, 500,000 yuan, and 1 million yuan, totaling 12.8 billion yuan. All those who donate money for military aid must exchange for military aid coupons as receipts. Please exchange the donation for military aid coupons on the spot for each household's donation. It is best to paste the coupons on the door to show that every household supports the donation of military aid to suppress the communists and build the nation. (5) Procedures for receiving coupons and paying money: All military aid coupons will be issued by the City Bank representative. Each district fundraising committee will receive them from the City Bank with the chairman and vice-chairman's stamps based on the planned amount. At the end, the donations and remaining coupons will be directly submitted to the City Bank for settlement. In addition, the money donated daily by each district will be temporarily deposited in nearby banks or City Bank offices, and then transferred to the City Bank for transfer at the end. (6) Fundraising methods for groups and individuals: In addition to household fundraising, any groups and individuals who respond to the Ten Thousand Yuan Military Aid and voluntarily donate money should purchase military aid coupons from the City Bank and its offices with the donations. Donations previously handed over to the municipal government and municipal party headquarters for transfer must also be handed over to the City Bank to exchange for military aid coupons and returned to the original donors as receipts to show caution.</p>
<p>[Additional News] Mayor Wu attaches great importance to the Ten Thousand Yuan Military Aid Movement. He has scheduled to convene all district chiefs, deputy district chiefs, chairmen of district people's representatives, and fundraising personnel at the Municipal Senate on the 25th to discuss promotion methods and invite media personnel to study together.</p>
<h3>President Zhang's New Wife Secretly Arrives in Shanghai: Flutters Down from the Plane, Shyly Avoiding the Camera; A Puff of Smoke and Drives Away; Mrs. Xu Zhimo Accompanies on the Same Flight</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Ms. Zhou Bixia, the new wife of President Zhang of the National Bank, arrived at Longhua Airport at 5:35 PM yesterday on the "Air King." As Zhang Jia'ao went to Beijing on official business, his daughter Zhang Junmai, as a niece, represented to welcome the new aunt. Many senior officials of the National Bank also went to welcome and take care of everything. Mrs. Zhang's arrival yesterday was done secretly, and the relatives and friends who went to the airport to welcome her were silent about it. After the "Air King" landed, passengers walked away one after another, but Mrs. Zhang remained seated. An official from the customs office stepped into the cabin to express his congratulations, but Mrs. Zhang smiled without saying a word. He repeatedly asked his accompanying friend, "Are there any photographers outside?" At this time, the welcoming relatives and friends waited anxiously outside the waiting room, not knowing that the bride had her own clever plan. At this time, the flight attendant on the plane told the reporter of this newspaper standing by the plane that all the passengers had disembarked, but as soon as the reporter turned and walked back to the waiting room, Mrs. Zhang quickly walked down the stairs from the plane and left with another elderly female passenger. This noble lady, who has become a news item, was wearing a white-bottomed green floral cheongsam, sunglasses, and a camera. She was of medium height, plump and healthy, and had a graceful and dignified demeanor. When the reporter approached to take a photo, she immediately covered her face with a folding fan. After shaking hands with the welcomers in a hurry, without exchanging greetings, she was accompanied by the welcomers out of the waiting room and quickly boarded a prepared car. When the reporter of this newspaper asked to take another photo, Secretary Lu Dingzhong of the National Bank strongly prevented it, saying that this was "Mrs. Zhu Yigeng", not the president's wife. Then the car drove away quickly. At this time, the relatives and friends of the Zhang family and the staff of the National Bank were busy with the baggage inspection procedures for her at the customs checkpoint, and it took about half an hour to complete. The luggage brought by this noble lady was marked with cloth strips with the words "Zhou Bixia, 60 Cave, Daxi Road". Summarizing all the things heard and seen, this so-called "Mrs. Zhu" is undoubtedly the new wife of Zhang Jia'ao. At about 7:00 PM, Secretary Lu of the National Bank called again, emphasizing that this female passenger was indeed "Mrs. Zhu Yigeng", fearing that this newspaper would mistakenly think she was Mrs. Zhang and send the wrong news, and came to inform us. His concern is very appreciated. But being too enthusiastic makes people feel like "trying to cover up". At 8:30 PM, this newspaper received a special telegram from this newspaper's Peiping correspondent, which read in part: "Ms. Zhou Bixia flew to Shanghai on the Air King at 1:00 PM, wearing a white-bottomed green floral cheongsam, round face, round eyes, plump body, and black glasses, and carrying a red and white coat and a camera. Mrs. Xu (i.e., Zhang's second sister, Mrs. Xu Zhimo) was wearing a gray overcoat, taller, about fifty years old, also wearing black glasses and traveled with her", which is exactly the same as what the reporter of this newspaper saw at Longhua Airport. Therefore, the new wife of the president of the National Bank has indeed arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The so-called "Mrs. Zhu" is just a smokescreen, probably because she was deeply afraid that the new wife would be surrounded and embarrassed by reporters when she got off the plane, and had no choice but to do so.</p>
<p>(The attached photo is of Mrs. Zhang covering her face with a fan to avoid photography, taken by this newspaper)</p>

<h3>Cathay Invites the Press, Film and Drama Celebrities to Express Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Own Report] Cathay Film Company invited the press yesterday to report on the progress of the "Fake Phoenix and False Dragon" dispute. During the meeting, Luo Xuelian, Cao Yu, and Ouyang Yuqian expressed several opinions.</p>
<p>Luo Xuelian said: "This matter is like a sesame seed cake. One says it is sweet, and the other says it is bitter. The problem is very simple. You can know by opening it and tasting it."</p>
<p>"I don't think the Cathay authorities have any intention of insulting. But on the other hand, if all the members of the barbershop industry think about it, they can't be said to be unreasonable for responding to the opposition before understanding the truth. However, this small misunderstanding can be easily resolved if you open the sesame seed cake and taste it, I believe."</p>
<p>"In the structure of the story, there must be characters, occupations, regions, and interweaving. Especially in comedy, laughter, mischief, and humor are necessary conditions, so it cannot be misinterpreted. There is no intention of insult here."</p>
<p>Cao Yu said: "I think the one who should protest the most is that bastard manager. In fact, the kindest is that third-class barber. In the end, he is not only the kindest, but also the bravest."</p>
<p>"Looking at the intention: the whole film is full of lightness. The ending is especially lovely. Without shouting slogans, it uses a method of awakening and kicks the bad guy away."</p>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian said: "Rather than saying it satirizes barbers, it is better to say that it satirizes a certain unreasonable enterprise company's general manager. This story is expressed with joy and is handled very satisfactorily."</p>
<p>"If the barber relied on a woman to take a car and live in a foreign house at the end, this would be a real insult. Now that the third-class finally gives up hypocrisy and ends this story in the situation of self-reliance, it seems that there should be no more misunderstanding."</p>

<p>[Our Own Report] Wu Jie, the principal offender in the daylight kidnapping case that occurred in Jiangwan on the 19th of this month, was at large. It is now known that the offender has been arrested by the Yangshupu Military Police Branch. On the 19th, at noon, Zhang Jingen, a villager from Xizhangjia Village, Jiangwan Town, was kidnapped by three plainclothes men and two uniformed men in a dispatched car.

At that time, Wu Jie was concentrating and elated. Qi Hongxue identified him in the dark, and the military police rushed up and arrested the offender, turning extreme joy into sorrow.

<h3>An Old Thief Humiliated by Petty Thieves; Attempting to Gain Without Labor, All Arrested Together</h3>

<p>After taking them to the station for interrogation, the old man confessed: His name is Liao Baorong, from Ningbo, 48 years old, and he makes a living by stealing. He had just climbed over the wall at that location and stolen a burlap sack containing four dou of white rice. Just as he was climbing out, he was suddenly confronted by these three individuals who claimed to be civil servants and seized him. At the time, he did not recognize whether they were genuine or not, so he had no choice but to admit to the theft. They then asked if there were any bicycles inside. He replied that there were. They then ordered him to climb back over the wall and open the iron gate, but because the gate was exceptionally sturdy, he was unable to do so. When he climbed out for the second time, he was unfortunately spotted and arrested by the police. Upon questioning the arrested young man, he claimed his name was Li Miaosheng, 20 years old, from Nantong, residing at No. 35, Lane 4, Cao Xie Wan, Lujiabang, Nanshi.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The position of President of National Central University was approved at the Executive Yuan's routine meeting the day before yesterday, and Lin Yimin, Dean of Academic Affairs and Director of the Chemistry Department at National Fudan University here, was appointed as the successor. When a reporter visited Mr. Lin yesterday, he received the reporter and made a statement saying, "Now that I have been appointed, I should follow the government's instructions, uphold the spirit of education, and do my best." Mr. Lin then elaborated on three points: (1) Strengthening the faculty is a current urgent task for all universities. Upon assuming this position, I will ask the original professors to continue serving at the university. For professors who are lacking in various departments, I will do my best to recruit them in Beijing and Shanghai to strengthen the faculty lineup. (2) Increasing equipment: Central University was established during the war, and due to environmental influences, the university's various equipment needs to be greatly improved in order to increase the teaching and learning interests of teachers and students.

<h3>Over 5,000 Elementary School Teachers in Shanghai Apply for Certification and Registration</h3>
<p>Recently Exceeded 5,000 People</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Over 5,000 people have applied for the certification and registration of elementary school teachers conducted by the Municipal Bureau of Education, and many of them have come from other counties. According to the Bureau of Education, this certification is only to protect qualifications and recognize them as qualified teachers, and it does not guarantee job placement. However, starting next semester, all teachers hired by municipal elementary schools must be certified. Private elementary schools will use the number of certified teachers as a standard for evaluation. For this certification, those with qualified documents will be issued a certificate after review. Those with unqualified documents will be asked to submit supplementary documents for review. The reasons for unqualified documents can be divided into two types: one is that documents were lost during the eight years of war and turmoil, which is understandable, and if they can provide sufficient proof of graduation from a certain school or previous service, it will be approved. However, forgery of documents with the intention of deception will not be approved.</p>
<h3>National Textbook Content Outdated; Even the Word "Atom" Not Included in the Atomic Age; Latest Revised National Edition Published by the Seven-Agency Alliance</h3>
<p>[Report from the Dihua News Agency] Recently, the issue of new editions of national textbooks has arisen in the publishing industry, causing confusion and bewilderment. To clarify the situation, a reporter interviewed someone who has been involved in the production and printing of national textbooks since the wartime period in the rear and who continues to do so today. The national textbook's initial edition was published at the beginning of the Pacific War, named the "Provisional Edition." It was then revised and compiled into the "Standard Edition" after repeated discussions with various experts. At the beginning of the restoration, it was revised and compiled into the "Revised Edition" after collecting opinions from all parties. Before each printing, personnel from the National Institute for Compilation and Translation were sent to proofread. In the rush, it was inevitable that there would be some minor errors, which is not the responsibility of the publishing industry. However, the publishing houses of the Seven-Agency Alliance have already corrected these errors in books published after the spring of this year, based on the errata sheets compiled by the Institute for Compilation and Translation from the initial Revised Edition of previous years. The versions of the ten-plus publishers of the former Seven-Agency Alliance, including Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, World, Datong, Kaiming, Wentong, Children's, Chinese Culture, and Independent Victory, have been corrected one by one based on several errata sheets. Some merchants recently used "publication announcements" of the newly revised edition to attract cash, but in fact, their versions had become old versions before they were even published. There have been no major revisions to the content of the most recent national textbooks. The so-called new and old revised editions are merely promotional language used in the eyes of merchants. In reality, they are only corrections of a few minor errors. If one insists on distinguishing between new and old, then the publishers of the latest revised edition are still the ten-plus publishers, including Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, and Zhonghua, because these ten-plus publishers have all followed the latest revisions stipulated by the Ministry of Education, with complete supplies of various subjects for primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>[Another Report] According to an educator, in the atomic age, China is lagging behind in everything, and the national textbooks, which are supposed to nurture the next generation, have not even included the word "atom." The outdated content is almost equivalent to ancient textbooks such as the Three Character Classic. They should be completely abolished immediately and rewritten, and new materials from the new era should be collected as much as possible to provide students with the latest knowledge. This is a fundamental condition for the country to cultivate talent, and it cannot be dealt with perfunctorily or carelessly, or it will always lead to the path of "lagging behind."</p>

<h3>Rumors of Jiaotong University's Dissolution Are Inaccurate; Zhao Zengyu Returns to Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday and Says So</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhao Zengyu and another person, representatives of the Jiaotong University Alumni Association, went to Beijing to provide the Ministry of Education with the association's opinions on their alma mater. They have now completed their mission and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. Mr. Zhao told reporters yesterday that the association's representatives provided two points to Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education: First, they requested the prompt appointment of a highly respected person to succeed as the university's president and preside over the university's affairs. Second, the reorganization of Jiaotong University's affairs should prioritize proactive measures over passive measures. Minister Zhu has accepted these points. As for the University Affairs Reorganization Committee established by the Ministry of Education, it is of a transitional nature and will be abolished as soon as the new president is appointed. The committee will be composed of relevant personnel appointed by the Ministry of Education, and Vice Minister Hang will come to Shanghai soon to preside over a meeting of the committee. Regarding the rumors that Jiaotong University will be dissolved, Mr. Zhao said: They are completely inaccurate because Jiaotong University has a history of fifty years and has produced numerous engineering talents, which is evident to everyone in society.

<p>Charity Tennis Tournament: (Top) Ye Guanxiong and Carson Shake Hands After the Match (Photo by China News Agency) (Bottom) Huang Shaohong Pictured with Jin Ruxuan, Who Purchased Charity Balls (Photo by Our Newspaper)</p>
<h3>Grand Charity Tennis Tournament; Ye Guanxiong and Carson; Tennis Racquet Auctioned for 25 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>To relieve the flood disaster in Guangdong and Guangxi, Minister Bai, Vice President Huang, Provincial Chairman Huang, and others initiated a charity tennis match organized by the Tennis Committee. The Tennis Committee specially invited Hong Kong champion Ye Guanxiong, who recently came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, to participate and compete in a singles exhibition match with Shanghai champion Carson. The meeting of the two heroes from the North and South was a rare and grand event, and the charitable cause made it even more so. Therefore, nearly 1,000 people braved the heat to attend yesterday, making the atmosphere extremely lively. During the match, four charity balls were auctioned off and purchased by Jin Ruxuan of Zhen Tai Sports Association for 15 million yuan. Afterwards, Ye Guanxiong's tennis racquet was auctioned off, and Che Bingrong of Xi Hua Construction Company purchased it for 10 million yuan. Their enthusiasm is commendable. Vice President Huang presented each of the performing players with a medal.</p>
<p>Huang Shaohong Spoke At 5:00 PM, Vice President Huang Shaohong delivered a speech, stating that the flood disaster in Guangdong and Guangxi was serious, and he and the sports community in Shanghai had initiated a charity tennis match. He thanked people from all walks of life for attending on behalf of the flood victims in Guangdong and Guangxi. The match then began immediately. The results of the three matches are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Ye Guanxiong and Carson (Singles) 3-6, 6-3, 7-7.</p>
<p>(2) Xie Zhaoliang and Li Guoyao Win Against Chen Yiyu and Tian Guang (Doubles) 6-3.</p>
<p>(3) Ye Guanxiong and Wang Wenzheng Win Against Carson and Shi Guiya (Doubles) 6-2, 6-3.</p>
<p>Ye and Carson Compete; Referee Hu Xiansheng Carson served first and won. Then each of them served and won until they were tied at 3-3. Carson then won three consecutive games to win the first set 6-3. In the second set, Ye Guanxiong fought hard and took three consecutive games. Carson counterattacked and was tied at 3-3. Ye made another effort and also won a set 6-3. In the final set, the competition between the two sides became even more intense. Ye Guanxiong always took the lead, achieving a situation of 5-3. Carson won three consecutive games to lead 6-5. Ye Guanxiong again forced a tie and took the lead with 7-6, before Carson once again tied it at 7-7. At that time, dark clouds gathered, and it looked like it would rain heavily. The organizers announced that the match would end in a draw.</p>
<p>Doubles Match Soon After The Dark Clouds Gradually Dispersed, and the Doubles Match Continued First, Xie Zhaoliang and Li Guopan competed against Chen Yiyu and Tian Guang. Because it was already late, only one set was played. As a result, Xie and Li won 6-3. The final doubles match was between Ye Guanxiong and Wang Wenzheng against Carson and Shi Guiya. When the match started, it was already dark. Shi Guiya was older and his eyesight was poor, so Carson had to carry the team. Ye and Wang took the opportunity to go straight in, and as a result, they won 6-2, 6-3 against Carson and Shi Guiya.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye's Performance The Chinese People Have High Hopes The skill of Ye Guanxiong's tennis has attracted a lot of attention. His posture and hitting skills are very good, and his volleying is particularly unique. His draws are also mostly wonderful, but his serve is slightly weak. Carson did not seem to be at his normal level yesterday. His smashes touched the net and he made double faults. It was clear that Ye was not as skilled as Carson, but as a 22-year-old youth, his achievements are already not bad, and his future is unlimited.</p>

<h3>Industrial and Commercial Groups Actively Exploring the Issue of Opening Trade with Japan: While Strengthening Controls Can Limit the Dumping of Japanese Goods, the Problems of Smuggling and Hidden Goods Cannot Be Ignored</h3>
<p>Since MacArthur's headquarters approved foreign trade with Japan, our national authorities are also considering technical issues and sending commercial representatives to Japan, which has drawn close attention from the people nationwide. Given the impact of Japanese goods on national industries, Shanghai's domestic goods factories and all workers believe that the entry of Japanese goods will inevitably affect national industries. The Shanghai United Association of Domestically Made Mechanical Goods Factories specially convened a meeting the day before yesterday (the 22nd). The attending current directors, including Ren Daohong, Hong Nian, Hu Xiyuan, Hu Boxing, Gu Keming, and Wang Jiazhen, elected Hu Boxing as the chairman. After detailed discussions, all directors unanimously and enthusiastically opposed the plan. In addition to issuing a declaration asking for sympathy and assistance from all sectors, they also submitted a request to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government to immediately stop considering the plan and suspend the dispatch of representatives to Japan. They stated that independent countries should have their own trade policies and should not abandon their initiative due to international relations. Since the peace treaty has not yet been signed, war losses still need to be compensated, and it is still too early for commercial exchanges. Furthermore, since the people are still recovering from the war and unable to bear economic exploitation, factories struggling to survive cannot withstand the destruction caused by the influx of foreign goods. If there is a shortage of raw materials, barter trade has already been implemented. Under the current circumstances, where proper relations between China and Japan have not been restored, there is no need to open private trade. Japanese goods exported to Southeast Asia will seize the overseas markets of Chinese goods, and if they further invade the domestic market, our national industries will be destroyed, and all reconstruction efforts will be in vain. Therefore, opening trade with Japan will cause great harm to the country and the people, without any benefits, and there is no value in considering it.</p>
<h3>National Industrial Association to Hold Meeting Today</h3>
<p>To discuss opposing the dumping of Japanese goods in China, the China National Industrial Association has specifically scheduled a meeting of directors and supervisors on the 24th in Beijing. The association's directors and supervisors from Shanghai, including Wu Yun Chu, Hu Jian Xiang, Rong Hong Yuan, Tian He Qing, Tang Cheng Zong, and Tao Guilin, took the night train to Beijing last night. Directors and supervisors from industrial associations in various regions will also come to Nanjing to attend the meeting. In addition to all directors and supervisors, the chairmen of industrial associations from various provinces will also be invited to participate. Before his departure, Director Tian Heqing told reporters that some people who are not aware of the actual situation believe that the entry of Japanese goods into China will not lead to dumping, in accordance with the country's economic policies. However, they do not know that the import of cheap goods is like mercury seeping into the ground, entering every home. Smuggling and hidden goods are rampant. Last year, domestic factories suffered huge losses from the import of cheap American goods, to the point where it was almost impossible to calculate. Moreover, the current prices of Japanese goods are even lower than those of American goods. Furthermore, according to Hu Boxing, a standing director of the National Industrial Association, all domestic manufacturers firmly oppose the import of Japanese goods, and he hopes that those who hold a different view will change their initial intentions.</p>
<p>According to reporter's inquiry, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Industrial Association, the China Production Promotion Association, the Shanghai United Association of Domestically Made Mechanical Goods Factories, and various industrial guilds will jointly discuss the issue of opposing the sale of Japanese goods in China.</p>
<h3>Explanation of Import Control: Stakes and Concerns</h3>
<p>According to responsible persons from the Import Control Committee, from a purely economic standpoint, China can open trade with Japan because China needs a large amount of Japanese industrial raw materials. China needs foreign exchange to order various materials from abroad, and ordering Japanese materials is no different from ordering American materials. However, the United States' opening of trade with Japan this time is of course of great benefit to the United States itself, but if China opens trade with Japan, it will be harmful rather than beneficial to China because China's industry is not as developed as Japan's. Under these circumstances, China must strengthen control measures and prohibit the import of any materials that are not beneficial to China's construction. Furthermore, based on a realistic prediction, the volume of trade after the opening of trade between China and Japan will definitely be small, because China has strict import controls and Japan has joint controls by the Allied forces. Japan will definitely not be able to dump large quantities of cheap goods in China. The concerns of the Industrial Association have also been considered by the Import Control Committee. The Import Control Committee will definitely not allow Japan to ship large quantities of materials to China and destroy China's industry.</p>
<h3>Deputy Director of the Central Trust Bureau Discusses: Concerns Are Unnecessary</h3>
<p>Regarding the opening of Japanese foreign trade, opinions vary. Some advocate for a temporary delay, while others express that there is no need to worry. Each side has its own reasons. The reporter specifically visited Luo Yin, Deputy Director of the Central Trust Bureau, to ask for his opinion. According to Luo, various parties have expressed concerns about this issue, which is incomprehensible to him personally. Opening Japanese foreign trade may not necessarily benefit China's industry and commerce, but we must know that although Japan is a defeated country, it cannot be permanently prohibited from foreign trade. Once we understand this point, our concerns are largely unnecessary. As for the concern that a large number of Japanese goods may be dumped in China once Japanese trade is opened, there will be no problem as long as we strictly implement our import control policies. The reporter then asked whether opening Japanese foreign trade would conflict with the government's current barter trade policy with Japan. Luo said that the barter trade policy is conducted between governments and is fundamentally different in nature from general ordinary trade. Moreover, the goods imported from Japan under the current barter trade policy have all been designated by our government in advance and are all essential goods. Therefore, the barter trade policy will continue without conflict after the official opening of trade with Japan and will not cause any harm.</p>
<h3>Loose Money Supply and Low Interest Rates: Chinese Stocks Maintain Trading Range</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks fell again yesterday. Many major players in the industry were short sellers and took advantage of the high pressure from news of Japanese silk exports, which was considered unfavorable to Mei Ya. Short covering from the previous day reappeared at high prices, and the fragile stock market was ultimately forced to submit. Short sellers rampaged, long positions surrendered, and the market showed great weakness midway through the day. At noon, despite the extremely loose money supply and low overnight interest rates of around one corner, without the support of buyers, there was a slight rebound, but the market ended within a trading range.</p>
<p>The morning opened high, and after the opening, Mei Ya numbers 231 and 171 were bought, while numbers 142, 223, 185, 24, 94, 14, and 143 were sold. Especially the selling of number 223 continued, pushing the current delivery price of Mei Ya down to 490 yuan. Numbers 151, 186, and 219 took advantage of the low prices to buy, but the rebound was weak. Numbers 223, 134, 36, and 35 resold, and number 14 even sold current Mei Ya, causing the current delivery price of Mei Ya to fall further to 473 yuan. After 9:45 AM, numbers 40, 8, 231, 42, and 152 took advantage of the low prices to buy up to 484 yuan. Numbers 235, 36, 85, 24, 232, 65, and 149 came to close positions again. Li An first hung low to the limit down at 10:10 AM, causing Mei Ya to fall to a low price of 460 yuan. Current delivery has already been squared at this point. Xin He was sold by numbers 160, 35, 235, 163, and 181, forcing the price down to 2800 yuan and 2820 yuan. The Xin Guang Luban Road store department on the third floor lost their caution. Number 218 and retail investors all sold, causing the spot market to fall to a low of 162 yuan and the forward market to a low of 163 yuan. Jing Fu was simultaneously pressured down to 143 yuan. Numbers 160, 237, 137 sub-branch, and 163 bought. At 11:15 AM, Mei Ya rebounded to 480 yuan, while numbers 84, 69, 179, 104, and 4 sold, causing the price to fall back to 468 yuan. Numbers 157, 232, and 8 bought. With the loose money supply and low overnight interest rates of around one corner, people's spirits were slightly lifted, and Mei Ya rebounded to 485 yuan. Numbers 84 and 197 increased their holding in Xin He. Number 152 slightly increased their holding of current Xin He, pushing the price up to around 3030 yuan after 12:00 PM. Numbers 219, 76, 117, 97, and 60 continued to pressure the market. Numbers 106 and 85 also sold current Mei Ya, causing the price to fall again to below 470 yuan before closing. Xin He was also closed by numbers 157 and 133, falling to around 2900 yuan, and the market ended within a trading range. After closing, Mei Ya was bought by numbers 223, 160, and 231, with short positions covering, and the price was called up to around 475 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing, spot stocks Xin Guang, Xin He, Qin Xing, and Xin Hua did not fall much. Mei Ya, Hua Chang, Zhong Fa, and Yong Gong each fell by half a percentage point. Nei Yi, Da Tong, Rong Feng, Match, Cement, and Jing Lun were flat. Xin Ya, Zhong Fang, and Tong Yi each fell by around half a percentage point. Li An rebounded after hitting the limit down, falling by less than 20%. The remaining stocks fell slightly. Among the late six stocks, Xin Guang and Xin He fell slightly, while Jing Fu, Hua Feng, Mei Ya, and Yong Gong each fell by half a percentage point. In the off-exchange market, old stocks Shi Jie, Zhong Hua, Zhabei, and Hua Shang all fell by half a percentage point, and the remaining stocks were also flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Yong Sha New Shares Listed: Trading Unit Temporarily Set at 50,000 Shares</h3>
<p>In the off-exchange market, Yong Sha's residual value opened at 194 yuan to 197 yuan, with a low of 173 yuan to 176 yuan, and finally settled at 189 yuan to 192 yuan. Interest rates were 1.65 corners to 2.1 corners, and small stocks were 1.2 corners to 1.65 corners in Yunnan. Yesterday, Zheng Liu issued an announcement stating that Yong An Textile Co., Ltd. had reported on July 23rd that its capital increase had been completed.

As a result, compared to the previous closing, Jia, Yi, and Wu each rose by 700 yuan, Tong Ding rose by 600 yuan, and Tong Bing rose by 100 yuan. The total trading volume was approximately 2 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were mixed yesterday, with the process gradually stabilizing.

Yi Mao also gradually rose from 62,800 yuan to close at 66,000 yuan. Yang Hang and Guang Hang advanced, while securities firms and Qian Dui sold. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the paper industry and Guang Ping were flat, the steel industry and Yi Sha fell slightly, and the remaining stocks all rose slightly.</p>
<h3>American Silk Industry Launches the Raw Silk Promotion Movement Committee</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Given the decline in raw silk sales after the war and the growing trend of "Nylon" products dominating the market, authorities in the American silk industry, in order to prevent future losses and promote the use of raw silk, have jointly established a raw silk promotion organization called the Raw Silk Promotion Movement Committee in conjunction with world-producing silk countries, under the leadership of Gerli. It is stipulated that all raw silk exporting countries will add a membership fee of US$0.05 per pound of raw silk imported into the United States. Based on 133 pounds per dan, it will be US$6.65 per dan, collected by participating representatives from each local country. The estimated total amount of this fee is approximately several hundred thousand US dollars. As a major raw silk producing country, China has also been invited, and it is reported that the Silk Production and Marketing Guidance Committee has already agreed to support the initiative.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar to Distribute Sugar Today: Totaling More Than 45,000 Bags</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Taiwan Sugar Corporation is scheduled to hold the 24th and 25th joint distributions today, with a total amount of approximately 45,000 bags of sugar.

The approval of application quantities will be based on double the amount of Shi Mao cotton white bags allocated to each customer in the 23rd distribution, as well as double the amount of red sand and Shi Mao sand white bags previously allocated, converted to No. 2 sand white.</p>
<h3>Household Sugar Distribution Price Revised to 4,500 Yuan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Regarding the distribution price of household sugar in the city, the Sugar Evaluation Committee has re-decided to increase the price to 4,500 yuan per catty, starting from the fifth distribution period in early August.</p>
<h3>Heavy Selling Pressure and Frequent Disposals: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Fall Again: 42-Count Blue Phoenix Yarn Drops Another 200,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>In yesterday's cotton yarn market, the price of yarn offered by Fang Jian Company has been reduced. The listed price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was lowered to 16.8 million yuan for sale. Buyers in the market were hesitant, and cloth factories and dyeing factories were also watching. In the end, due to heavy selling pressure, the price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 17 million yuan, a further decrease of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse was 11.4 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan. Light Double Horse was 10.35 million yuan, a decrease of 150,000 yuan. Business for 16-count yarn was more active, and the market was firm and stable. The prices of other yarns all decreased by 100,000 to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Fang Jian Distributes Yarn</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] China Fang Jian Company distributed a total of 728 pieces of yarn yesterday on behalf of the Textile Adjustment Association, all of which were distributed to manufacturers. There were a total of 118 applications.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market initially showed some promise. Longtou fine cloth once traded higher, but then market sentiment weakened and interest waned. Due to strict controls on this street and a lack of new buyers, and because out-of-town buyers were losing money on the market, there was little activity. Disposals in the market exceeded purchases, and market sentiment collapsed. In the end, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell to 428,000 yuan, a decrease of 4,000 yuan from the previous day. Various grades of fine cloth, such as Wufu Color Ball and Yang He, also fell by 1,000 to 560 yuan. Sijunzi gabardine business was slow and fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Yin Guang bleached cloth sales were also sluggish, falling by 10,000 yuan. Only Yi Ding Ruyi rose by 5,000 yuan, while the market for other colored cloths and Shilin cloth remained stable.</p>
<p>Discussion and Pricing</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] The business department of the Textile Adjustment Association is scheduled to convene a meeting with local cotton cloth merchants at 4:00 PM tomorrow. It is reported that the pricing of cotton cloth will be discussed.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Trading Improves</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot cotton trading improved due to strong demand from yarn factories in other regions. Prices for high-grade cotton remained weak as fine yarn sales were not strong and yarn factories were less interested in buying. Raw materials for coarse yarn below 20 counts, such as Nantai Cang and Huoji, were in strong demand from local yarn factories, and sales were strong. Prices remained firm, and the trend seemed very stable. Prices offered to factories for each grade were: Brazilian, 2.3 million yuan; Huoji, 1.72 million yuan, 1.73 million yuan. Warehouse prices were: Ling Bao, 2.12 million yuan, 2.13 million yuan, 2.2 million yuan; Han Fine, 2.08 million yuan; Huoji, 1.72 million yuan; Nantai Cang, 1.86 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Financial Control Matters: Only Persistence Can Achieve Results</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] In order to cooperate with the General Mobilization Order, the Ministry of Finance plans to strengthen financial control measures in three areas: (1) controlling the financial market, (2) strengthening the management of banks and money houses, and (3) cracking down on speculative trading. The reporter specifically consulted Li Li, Director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, for his opinion. According to him, matters related to financial control must be implemented regularly and consistently in order to achieve the greatest results. The new control guidelines formulated by the Ministry of Finance will make the financial system more concrete. He believes that the main focus of financial control at present is to crack down on the black market for gold, banknotes, and foreign exchange. The Ministry of Finance and this department have recently been conducting regular inspections of various banks and money houses, and the main purpose is to actively help them get their money operations on the right track, rather than passively cracking down on them.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yaozhang Returns to Shanghai from India to Discuss the Production and Sales of Indian Cotton; Production Is Gradually No Longer Important to Our Country's Market</h3>
<p>Among the Chinese companies that have established branches in India, the Renren Enterprise Company was the first. Zhang Yaozhang, the business manager of the company, went to Mumbai last November to establish a branch. After spending eight months in India and traveling to major cities such as Quanli, Gardarda, etc., to investigate the Indian cotton market, he recently returned to China. Zhang said: Before World War II, the average annual cotton production in India was about 6 million bales. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, cotton production decreased significantly due to the concentration of efforts on increasing food production. Therefore, 1941 can be said to be a turning point in Indian cotton production. It decreased to 4.7 million bales in 1942, increased to 5.26 million bales after 1943, decreased to 3.5 million bales in 1944, and was only 3.4 million bales in 1945 and 1946. Before the war, Japan was the largest customer of Indian cotton, importing about 1.6 million to 2 million bales annually, followed by China. In 1930, the highest amount of Indian cotton exported to China was 1.6 million bales. Later, due to the increase in cotton production in our country, imports decreased year by year. Before the July 7th Incident, the amount of Indian cotton exported to China was negligible. After the fall of Shanghai, there was a slight improvement, increasing to 750,000 bales. Afterwards, it was interrupted again due to the severance of maritime transportation. Last year, Indian cotton exports to China were 450,000 bales, accounting for one-third of India's total exports. This year, our country is no longer an ideal market for Indian cotton. Because Japan is under the control of MacArthur, all textile raw materials depend on the United States, so currently, the sales channels for Indian cotton are only small European countries such as Spain, Belgium, and Czechoslovakia, with extremely small sales volumes. Currently, there are 1.5 million bales of cotton in Mumbai alone. In order to maintain the negotiated price and prevent a cotton industry crisis, the Indian government has automatically purchased 190,000 bales. Starting at the end of June, the government further abolished export control regulations to stimulate cotton prices. India has extremely strict import controls, and the sales of Chinese silk in India are very limited. Among the Chinese goods exported to India, there are six main categories, especially green beans, which are the most. The second is industrial products, such as thermos bottles and steel needles. However, due to the high cost, sales are quite difficult. Zhang had many impressions of India and said that we should no longer discriminate against India, and this incorrect view should be changed. Because at present, India's light and heavy industries are larger in scale than those of our country, and its import and export trade is also larger than that of China.</p>
<h3>The Export Promotion Committee Sends Personnel to Inspect the Actual Situation of Sichuan and Guangdong Raw Silk</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City News] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee previously decided at its 15th meeting that the purchase and expansion of sales of raw silk from Sichuan and Guangdong provinces should be carried out in accordance with the raw silk from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and entrusted the China Silk Company to formulate a purchase plan. It is now learned that before formulating a plan, the company must first send personnel to the silk-producing areas to investigate costs and actual conditions before making preparations. It has also sent letters to relevant authorities, such as the National Bank, the China Trust Bureau, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee, to jointly dispatch representatives to participate. The above letters were sent out on the morning of the 23rd. It is also learned that the annual output of raw silk (including native silk) in Sichuan and Guangdong is about 10,000 dan each. The quality of Sichuan silk is better than that of Guangdong silk, so the current market price of Guangdong silk is only 60-70% of the price of products from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, while Sichuan silk is 80-90%. However, Guangdong silk is intentionally improved. This spring, the China Silk Company issued 3,000 new varieties for trial cultivation, and the results are excellent. Sichuan has a seed-producing farm that can produce 500,000 sheets of silkworm eggs in spring and autumn, but most of them are old varieties, and new varieties account for only a small number.</p>
<h3>Anhui Roasted Green Tea Is Selling Well</h3>
<p>In recent days, the domestic sales of red and green tea have been gradually increasing, and especially this year's Anhui roasted green tea is becoming more and more active with the help of merchants, and the price is showing a trend of rising due to people's confidence. As for the foreign tea market, the Wuchang Tea Company continues to absorb low-grade old red tea. For other varieties such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei, which are sold to Africa, buyers are less eager than before because the French Yongxing Foreign Company recently reached an agreement with overseas merchants for 900 tons of green tea, and the current demand is gradually being met. However, holders of goods, considering that the market inventory is not abundant, generally intend to sell at higher prices, so the process is somewhat characterized by both supply and demand being quiet. Although transactions have become less frequent, the market is still sharp.</p>
<h3>World Fuel Conference to Be Held in The Hague</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper News] The World Fuel Conference is scheduled to be held in The Hague on September 1st this year to discuss the coordination of world fuel production and sales issues. It is reported that our country will send Liu Tingfang and Chen Kecheng as representatives to attend.</p>

<h3>Shaoyang Demonstration Factory: Watching the Growth of the Seedlings of Rural Industry</h3>
<p>— Hengyang, 18th (Air Dispatch) — Special Correspondent Huang Chao Ru</p>
<p>Industrialization is a universally recognized way to save the country, but we are an agricultural country that is based on agriculture. Farmers account for 80% of the national population. While saving the country through industry is justifiable, we cannot ignore the countryside and should devote ourselves to rural industrialization, building the foundation of industry in the countryside. Otherwise, indulging in the fantasy of the development of urban industry, thinking that it is the way to save the country, is abandoning the fundamentals and reversing the priorities, and in the end, we will deviate from the ideal harvest.</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) was established. Its work focused not only on passively relieving the inevitable disasters but also on restoring and rebuilding, especially the heavy reconstruction of the vast countryside that had been ravaged by war. Therefore, in 1945, Mr. Jiang Tingfu, the former director of CRRRA, discussed with Mr. Clemont, the head of rural industry at UNRRA, and decided to establish a constructive organization under CRRRA. UNRRA provided a large amount of equipment and dispatched technical personnel to China for joint cooperation, to assist local small-scale industries in their restoration and to establish demonstration factories as a trial for constructing rural industry, gradually promoting it to guide the backward countryside to gradually industrialize and enter the realm of science.</p>
<p>On May 1, 1946, the organizational regulations for the Rural Industrial Demonstration Group were approved. CRRRA sent expert Dr. Jiang Guanghui, together with UNRRA experts, to conduct on-site inspections, selecting Shaoyang in Hunan and Qujiang in Guangdong as the first phase of work areas. The Shaoyang area began that year, and the group headquarters was officially established in May.</p>
<p>After the group headquarters was established, it began to requisition land, build factories, and transport equipment. At the same time, in order to cooperate with foreign engineers, it specially requested the establishment of technical training classes to cultivate cadres in preparation for future promotion work. The first phase recruited 14 graduates from university science and engineering colleges and 6 high school students, and the second phase recruited 12 high school students, who were assigned to learn from foreign engineers. It also conducted detailed investigations into the resources, transportation, and original small industrial production conditions in the neighboring areas of Shaoyang and Qujiang, in order to serve as a reference for future work promotion. In November of the same year, foreign factory engineers arrived in Shaoyang one after another, and the factory construction project began.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the First Completed Mother Factory: The Mechanical Factory</p>
<p>In February of this year, the first factory to be completed was the mechanical factory, located near the Shaoyang East Bus Station at the group headquarters. This factory specializes in producing the necessary machinery for each factory to meet the needs of each factory, so it can be called the mother factory. The machinery and equipment allocated by UNRRA began to arrive in September 1946, and a temporary workshop was first built in front of the group headquarters. When the factory building was completed in February of this year, the equipment was increased, and it was officially established.</p>
<p>The factory has a power house, equipped with two 15-kilowatt generators and two 30-kilowatt generators, providing electricity for lighting the group headquarters and power for the entire factory. There are four large and small lathes, one planer, one milling machine, and four presses. Other equipment includes dozens of types of AC and DC electric motors, air compressors, hydraulic presses, and electric grinders. Although they are small tools, they are all the most standard machines from the American wartime, which are widely used and convenient to construct. Expansion is currently planned, with the addition of one long-stroke planer and one universal welding bed. The foundry originally used a 500-pound iron melting furnace, but now the output is insufficient, and it is planned to add a one-ton melting furnace. The small mold shop is also planning to expand.</p>
<p>This factory specializes in supplying machinery to various factories, so its business is purely internal. Now, in order to expand external business, it plans to repair and assemble parts for various private factories and manufacture a large number of rice milling machines and oil presses to meet the needs of rural farmers.</p>
<p>Cement, Sulfuric Acid, and Fertilizer: Three Factories Completed</p>
<p>The cement, sulfuric acid, and fertilizer factories were completed one after another this year.</p>
<p>The cement factory among the three is set up using small-scale production methods, and its equipment includes: (1) a 5×5 horizontal large tube boiler; (2) a 25HP steam engine; (3) a 15KVA generator; (4) a jaw crusher; (5) a ball mill; (6) a mixer; (7) a blower; and (8) a cement vertical kiln.</p>
<p>The raw material for cement is limestone taken from near the factory, which has the highest calcium chloride content, and the magnesium chloride and sulfide content is extremely low. The nearby clay has abundant silicon and iron chloride content, which can be called a high-quality raw material for cement. Because the factory was established not long ago, its current output cannot meet the needs of the Shaoyang market. It is now planning to add a 100-horsepower boiler and engine, and increase vertical kilns and grinding equipment, with the goal of producing 100 bags per day (each bag is about 100 jin).</p>
<p>The sulfuric acid factory is located on Wutaishan, outside the East Gate. The factory was designed by American engineer Mr. Caricoporez, who participated in the US Army Rural Industry Department's experimental work in South America, so he has rich experience. The factory will use the aluminum chamber method, which is the most economical small sulfuric acid factory. The only important material is lead sheet, and various equipment requires this. However, the output of Hunan's blue lead has been extremely small since the war. After many attempts, 10 tons were purchased from the Hunan Lead Smelting Plant, and the Hengyang Yongsheng Chemical Plant was entrusted to press them into sheets for application. The required acid-resistant bricks are replaced by refractory bricks produced by the Lingling China Industry Company, which are still suitable.</p>
<p>The factory is equipped with: (1) a sulfur burner, with a total of three furnace chambers, which is a dual-purpose sulfur and iron burner. At the beginning of the construction, only one sulfur burner was used; (2) a dust removal chamber with a volume of 20 cubic feet; (2) a denitration tower with a volume of 37.5 cubic feet; (4) five lead chambers, each with a volume of four cubic feet supported by cable stays, and a cooling area of 160 square feet; (5) three nitration towers, each with a volume of 25 cubic feet; (6) three acid pumps (acid eggs); (7) a small steam boiler; (8) an air compressor; and (9) a chimney. In addition to the above items, other equipment such as acid-receiving ponds, water supply devices, water pumps, generators, electric lights, telephones, and measuring instruments are fully equipped and can be used. Because coking has not yet started, the manufactured sulfuric acid is being planned to be concentrated and temporarily supplied to the market. This equipment can be completed before the end of this month.</p>
<p>The raw material source was originally sulfur taken from Shuikoushan in Changning, but the supply there is not smooth and the price is too high. It is planned to use iron pyrite as raw material to reduce costs. There is not much production of this mineral in Shaoyang, and the sulfur content is not high, which is difficult to meet the requirements. Recently, a batch was purchased in Xiangxiang, and the trial results were satisfactory, so the future raw material supply will probably be dominated by Xiangxiang.</p>
<p>The current output is about 1,000 pounds per day, which is worth about 4 million yuan at market prices. It can be increased to 2,000 pounds in a few days. The sales are currently only supplying the needs of the Shaoyang market, and the rest is kept for self-use. There are many orders from all parties, and there is a trend of (difficulty in meeting demand).</p>
<p>The fertilizer factory is located on Shangqiang on the west bank of the Shaoshui River. In January of this year, UNRRA sent sanitary engineer Mr. R. Stone to Shaoyang to start work. The fertilizer department project was completed at the end of April, ten public toilets in Shaoyang were completed at the end of May, and part of the drinking water supply project was completed at the end of June.</p>
<p>The fertilizer adopted by the factory uses the continuous operation fermentation method. The fermentation time is about 20 days in summer and 40 days in winter. During this fermentation period, due to the high temperature and gradual reduction of moisture, most of the bacteria and parasites such as dysentery, cholera, typhoid, roundworms, and whipworms originally stored in the feces die. This can reduce the spread of diseases. Furthermore, the fermentation of these fertilizers is carried out in airtight rooms, so the loss of contained gases is also small, and an appropriate amount of bone meal and straw are added, which increases the phosphorus and calcium, which are needed by plants and are uniquely lacking in feces. This is much better than the old composting method in our country.</p>
<p>The factory is equipped with (1) two sedimentation ponds with a capacity of 1,500 gallons; (2) two septic tanks with a capacity of 4,500 gallons; (3) six waste ponds with a capacity of 13,800 gallons; (4) two separate septic tanks with a capacity of 14,600 gallons.</p>
<p>Shaoyang farmland originally used feces as the main fertilizer. Farmers often travel dozens of miles, spending three or four days, to buy feces in the urban area. Now, the fertilizer produced by the factory is fermented and resolved into a viscous black solid. After being dried in the drying yard, its area and weight are greatly reduced, making it easy to transport, and the fertilizer effect is higher than raw manure. However, conservative farmers use it only after it has been mixed, and there are few adopters.</p>
<p>Refining and Rice Milling Factories Are Undergoing Innovation</p>
<p>What is described above are the four factories that have been completed and are in operation. In fact, the factories planned by the Shaoyang Rural Industrial Demonstration Group are not limited to this. Currently, the equipment is being improved in three factories: rice milling, oil pressing, and sugar making. The traditional methods are being researched and improved in two factories: leather making and papermaking. These factories that are being planned are urgently needed in the countryside, especially oil pressing, sugar making, leather making, and papermaking. If effective results can be seen in the future, they will make a great contribution to rural industry. Oil pressing is the most common in rural areas; sugar making in the sugarcane-producing areas of Shaoyang and Yuping in Hunan is the only side business for farmers, which is as important as sericulture in the villages of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Leather making is a special industry in Shaoyang and Changde; papermaking is an important industry in the villages of Shaoyang, Xinhua, Liuyang, and Taoyuan in Hunan. In paper-scarce China, if new papermaking methods can be applied, it is believed that these paper-producing areas will be able to produce a large amount to meet domestic needs and reduce a large amount of foreign exchange expenditure.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, the equipment of the Shaoyang industrial demonstration factories is still in its infancy, and the scale is pitifully small, but its future is limitless. The growth of this seedling will cause the conservative Chinese rural society, which has lasted for thousands of years, to step into the road of industrialization. It can also be said that it will be the driving force for building a new China. However, the success of any undertaking is not achieved overnight. Especially, the conservatism of the Chinese countryside is too strong, and the intellectual level of farmers is too low, making it difficult to accept new reforms. Taking fertilizer as an example, farmers are unwilling to give up their old methods of applying human and animal waste. Therefore, in addition to doing practical demonstration work, we must also carry out extensive publicity work. At the same time, we must also pay attention to the fact that Chinese people are often enthusiastic at the beginning but lack perseverance. Looking at history, the "Westernization Movement" of Li Hongzhang 50 years ago was done in a grand manner at the time, but it failed later. Today's rural industrial demonstration, from the perspective of the countryside, its environment is no different from Li Hongzhang's "Westernization Movement" 50 years ago. If the government is not careful, it will become an impractical ornament, self-sufficient and self-destructive. The demonstration is just a name and will not generate any real power. It is said that the foreign experts who are responsible for guiding the various departments of the Shaoyang Demonstration Factory will all return to their countries at the end of the year. The demonstration group also has a plan to sell all of them to private companies after the factories have achieved considerable results. This plan is absolutely correct, and we do not need to discuss it. However, we want to suggest that everyone pay attention to the fact that the Rural Industrial Demonstration Factory must never fall into the hands of speculative market prices in the future; before foreign experts return to their countries, preparations should be made early to select talents, because the machines in the demonstration factory are all the latest American models. We are not self-deprecating, but looking at the phenomenon of Belgium receiving enemy and puppet factories and having to stop the factory chimneys from smoking due to the lack of technical personnel, we are really worried about the talents who will take over the work of foreign experts!</p>
<p>Tanggu New Port: Cross-Section and Explanation From Our Newspaper Information Office</p>
<h3>The Improvement of the Hai River and Dagukou Sandbar Engineering Is Urgently Needed</h3>
<p>— Cui Deha</p>
<p>The preliminary plan for the Tanggu New Port project drafted by the Japanese was as early as before the July 7th Incident in 1937. In the author's opinion, the coast near Dagu is not suitable for building a shallow-water artificial seaport because the construction cost is very high. Revenue from ship sales, wharf fees, and mooring fees is not enough to repay the capital spent. Moreover, the new port silts up quickly and the maintenance costs are high. It is better to improve the Hai River and Dagukou sandbar, which is more cost-effective and has a greater effect. Therefore, the author believes that building a new port will disregard huge construction and maintenance costs. According to the author's deduction, the reasons for the Japanese to build this port are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Political factors: The Japanese wanted a port completely free from foreign influence. According to the treaty provisions, the new port is north of the Dagukou waterway and not within the scope of Tianjin Port.</p>
<p>(2) Strategic factors may also be an important reason.</p>
<p>(3) The estimated construction cost is too low.</p>
<p>(4) Japanese engineers do not understand the local situation and the estimation of sediment deposition is inaccurate, resulting in an underestimation of maintenance costs.</p>
<p>(5) At that time, the navigation conditions on the Hai River and Dagukou sandbar were extremely poor.</p>
<p>After the war ended, the original situation fundamentally changed. A thorough study and comparison are necessary: one is to increase a huge amount of capital to build a new port to adapt to the new environment, and the other is to spend less capital to improve the Hai River and Dagukou sandbar to achieve better results. Which of the two is more economical?</p>
<p>The original plan for the new port was to build multiple docks to accommodate ships with a draft of five meters. Most of the port was reserved for coastal shallow-water steamships to transport coal, iron, and food to Japan from Tanggu.</p>
<p>It is a mistake from an economic point of view to spend huge amounts of capital to build artificial seaports for coastal shallow-water steamships because it costs less to improve Tianjin Port. Since water transport is cheaper than railway transport, cargo transport should make the most use of ships to load goods to the interior. Therefore, the goods should not be unloaded at Tanggu but be traced up the river to reach Tianjin.</p>
<p>The depth of the river was 4.3 meters at the beginning of 1938. After dredging, it reached 4.6 meters by the end of the year. From 1939 to 1947, the depth near Tianjin was from 4.9 meters to 5.2 meters. The maintenance of this depth comes from the scouring of the water flow. If you want to reach a depth of 5.5 meters, you only need to dredge slightly near Tianjin. After the straightening of the bends from Gegu and Nankai, a water depth of 6.2 meters can be obtained without the need for dredging. Because the silting in the low-lying areas upstream of Tianjin is successful, the Hai River sediment problem can be solved, and a better depth can be obtained without the need for frequent dredging. After the depth of the downstream channel of Tianjin is gradually improved, Tanggu and Dagu from Xinhe to the estuary can reach 9 meters. This favorable situation for navigation will enable ships to directly transport goods to Tianjin instead of unloading them in Tanggu.</p>
<p>The silting of Dagukou sandbar in 1937 and 1939 was the main reason for the engineers who did not understand the local situation to decide to build a new port. From 1927 to 1934, the silting of the Hai River was quite severe. From 1929 to 1939, the total amount of sediment was 56,500,000 cubic meters. The sediment was deposited on the sandbar at the estuary after being scoured by rapid currents. The sand surface was silted up quite a bit, and the depth of the channel was drastically reduced. In a period of 1937, the channel on Dagukou sandbar was only 3.1 meters at high tide, and in 1939 it was only 2.75 meters deep, but in December it increased to 4 meters again. Since then, the channel on the sandbar has gradually deepened. The depth in 1940 was 4.6 meters, in 1941 it was 5.2 meters, and in 1943 it was 5.8 meters. When the dredging work was stopped for several months around the time of the restoration, the depth was reduced to 4 meters again. By the end of June 1947, it could reach 4.9 meters after dredging. The situation on Dagukou sandbar has been greatly improved since 1939. The height of the beach was originally 0.3 meters above the Dagu zero point. After the scouring of the tide, it was 1.5 meters below the zero point by 1946. This situation is because the amount of sediment discharged from the Hai River and transported to Dagukou has been greatly reduced, and it will continue to improve in the future. Since 1927, the amount of sediment from the tributaries of the Hai River flowing into the Hai River has also been greatly reduced. In 1927, the amount of sediment entering the Hai River was 10,000,000 cubic meters, in 1928 it was 9,800,000 cubic meters, and in 1929 it was 14,500,000 cubic meters. However, in recent years, it has been reduced to 1,000,000 cubic meters per year. The amount of sediment and the sediment supplied by the other three tributaries are about 2-3 million cubic meters per year and will continue to decrease gradually. In the future, it will be easier to dredge and maintain the deep-water channel on Dagukou sandbar. If two dredgers continue dredging from July 1947, it can reach 5.5 meters within the year. If two suction dredgers are used according to the current method, it can reach 6.1 meters in May 1948.</p>
<p>If a breakwater is built south of the Tanggu New Port breakwater to concentrate the current between the two breakwaters, the average high tide depth of the channel on Dagukou sandbar can reach 7.6 meters. If dredging continues after the south breakwater is completed, the water depth can reach 8.5 meters. Larger ships that now need to anchor outside Dagukou sandbar can be diverted to Tanggu.</p>
<p>This improvement work can also be extended to Tianjin, so that the Hai River can navigate ships with a draft of 8 meters. If the silting of the Chaobai River, the Tuo River, and the Zhang River are successful, the amount of sediment entering the Hai River will be greatly reduced. This silting project can also have the effect of flood control.</p>
<p>If Tanggu New Port develops into a port accessible to foreign-going liners, it is economically feasible because Tanggu is located on the coast of the bay, with a superior location, making it easy to attract foreign ships to anchor here. In terms of the scope of the hinterland and the convenience of land and water transportation north of Shanghai, it is also superior to other North China ports.</p>
<p>The development of Tanggu New Port and the improvement of the Hai River, Dagukou, Dagukou New River, as well as the navigation channel of Tianjin Port, must be achieved in the most economical way to obtain the greatest commercial and transportation benefits.</p>
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of developing the two are compared as follows:</p>
<p>1. Tanggu New Port: Long breakwaters must be built on both sides of the channel near the mouth of the New Port, which requires huge construction costs. Moreover, a large amount of sediment silts up in the port every year, so it must be dredged from time to time. Although the dredging cost can be slightly reduced by using special machinery, the maintenance cost is still very high.</p>
<p>The freezing of Tanggu New Port in winter, which hinders navigation, is another disadvantage. Although the ice in the port can be broken up by icebreakers, these ice floes are not easy to flow out due to the weak tidal force. The advantage of the New Port is that it is isolated from the Hai River and Dagukou sandbar, and the water depth does not change from time to time due to the amount of sediment in the Hai River.</p>
<p>2. The development of Hai River, Tanggu, and Tianjin requires deepening the channel on Dagukou sandbar. The ships currently sailing on the Hai River are limited by the water depth of the channel on Dagukou sandbar, and the current depth of Tianjin Port is actually shallower than the channel on Dagukou. The improvement of the Hai River and Dagukou sandbar should be implemented in the following ways:</p>
<p>A. Dredge the channel on Dagukou sandbar to a depth of 4.9 meters so that it is equal to the current minimum depth of Tianjin Port.</p>
<p>B. Dredge the channel on Dagukou sandbar to a depth of 5.5 meters. Both plans A and B can be worked on in 1947 with two suction dredgers.</p>
<p>C. Dredge Tianjin Port to a depth of 5.5 meters. This improvement work can be completed in the autumn of 1947 with the current dredging equipment.</p>
<p>D. Urgently dredge the channel on Dagukou sandbar to a depth of 6.1 meters. This improvement work can be completed by the end of 1947.</p>
<p>The advantages of the above improvement procedures are:</p>
<p>(1) Suitable for current transportation needs, because most of the goods transported to Tanggu and Tianjin are coastal steamships with a draft of 5.5 meters to 8.1 meters.</p>
<p>(2) The improvement is carried out using existing equipment, and the cost is extremely low.</p>
<p>(3) The force of the tide is enough to carry the sand into the sea, without the need for constant dredging.</p>
<p>It is clear which is more cost-effective and time-saving to improve Dagukou sandbar and the Hai River than to spend huge amounts of money to build a new port only for shallow-water steamships to dock.</p>
<p>The Hai River should be dredged to a depth of eight feet, straight to Tianjin. Even if the cost is more than building a new port, it is still recommended for long-term planning. Dredging an inland harbor's channel to the sea is often costly, but this alone is not enough reason to abandon the inland harbor and build a new port on the coast. For example, the Bremen port on the Weser River in Germany is 65 kilometers from the sea. In the past, the river was shallow, with a depth of only 7.0 meters. After dredging, it can now navigate ships with a draft of 8.4 meters. Another port was built at the estuary to accommodate a few ocean liners with a draft of more than 8.4 meters. However, the cost of the former dredging project is far more than the latter. Another example is the Glasgow port on the Clyde River in England. In the past, the depth was only three feet at high tide. At that time, a ship and theory believed that it was impossible to improve it to accommodate large ships. Therefore, a new port was built at the estuary. However, the result was that the new port project was abandoned, and the Clyde River dredging project was very effective. The width of the Clyde River increased from 135 feet to 450 feet, and the water depth increased from 5 feet to 30 feet. Another example is the Seine River in France. Huge sums of money were spent on dredging between the estuary and Rouen, 76 miles away, to allow large steamships to enter and exit. Its estuary port, Le Havre, is for deep-water ships to anchor.</p>
<p>The river channel of the Hai River in Tianjin has now been improved from 56 feet to 17 feet, and the river width has increased from 220 feet to 325 feet. Therefore, there should be no difficulty in further improvement to a river depth of 26 feet and a river width of 450 feet. In this way, most of the ships currently anchored outside Dagukou can go directly to Tianjin. The above examples of the Weser River, the Clyde River, and the Seine River can be applied to Tianjin and Dagukou in the same way. Therefore, dredging the Hai River and developing Tianjin Port is more important than building a Dagukou New Port to accommodate shallow-water liners. Moreover, if ocean liners can travel 60 kilometers upstream to reach Tianjin, the huge commercial benefits are enough to offset the cost of harnessing the Hai River and more.</p>
<p>The situation of the Hai River and Dagukou sandbar has greatly improved since the construction of the new port was discussed in 1937. The congestion of the river channel and the estuary has become a thing of the past due to the full control. The construction of Tanggu New Port and the harnessing of the Hai River should be carried out simultaneously, and coordinated by experienced engineers. A conclusion can be drawn: it would be a big mistake to ignore the Hai River and only focus on the new port.</p>

<h3>America's Forty-Ninth Star: The Restructuring of Hawaii</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhang Zikang from U.S. News &amp; World Report</p>
<p>The issue of adding Hawaii as the 49th state to the United States passed the U.S. Congress with a vote of 196 to 133 last month on the 30th. Now it is only waiting for the House of Representatives to agree and the President to sign it into law, then it will become a reality.</p>
<p>Before the issue of Hawaii becoming a state, the United States launched a verbal debate. When Hawaii's Congressional Representative Farrigton raised this issue, he said: Hawaii has a population of 519,000, more than the states of Nevada, Delaware, Colorado, Vermont, or New Hampshire. Although the population on the island is complex, with Japanese people accounting for one-third, these Japanese people have proven to be very loyal after the test of this war. Hawaii pays more federal taxes each year than fourteen of the forty-six states. It pays heavy taxes, but not only does it not have congressional representation, but it is also regarded as an "uncivilized" region, and its uniquely produced sugar is partially restricted.</p>
<p>In addition to presenting many reasons, Farrigton also skillfully used words to win the sympathy of his fellow Republicans behind the scenes. He said: (1) If the Republican Party's proposal to make Hawaii a state in 1944 had been successful, it would have benefited the party's election campaign in 1948. (2) The Republican Party's support of Hawaii's statehood would earn it the reputation of not discriminating against race among the northern cities. (3) Hawaii traditionally has Republican blood, and Hawaii's statehood will definitely produce two more Republican members of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Farrigton even talked about the issue of the American flag. He said that if Hawaii becomes a state, it will not hinder the traditional symmetry and propriety of the arrangement of the American flag. He provided three styles for Congress to refer to. (See attached picture)</p>
<p>He opposed the idea that Hawaii could not become a state under the unlimited education of the United States. He hoped to see the action performance of the American fair spirit. He said that if the United States agrees to Hawaii's request, it can give a clear impression to any region in the Pacific and the Far East, that is, the United States is cultivating the seeds of democracy everywhere.</p>
<p>However, there were also those who opposed Farrigton's argument. Republican Sabos said: "Hawaii's statehood will guarantee the extension of the financial monopoly of the five major families on the island." Republican Menasha said: "The Brezhnev forces lurking in Hawaiian farmers may elect two 'C.I.O.' (American left-wing industrial workers' union) members of Congress."</p>
<p>Democrat Georgia said: "Does it mean letting 180,000 Japanese people on the island enjoy the same political rights as American citizens?"</p>
<p>But in any case, the issue of Hawaii becoming a state has been passed by Congress. According to the speculation of Nebraska, the chairman of the House Land Committee: the fact of Hawaii becoming a state is expected to be realized this year. His personal opinion is: Hawaii is 2,400 miles away from San Francisco, so it is best to list it as an administrative region of California. Now, Nebraska's personal opinion is left aside for the time being. It seems that the final passage of Hawaii's statehood is not a problem. The problem is, what about the arrangement of the American flag? In addition to the following three types, are there any better arrangements? Readers, guess?</p>
<p>The Mystery of the Forty-Ninth Star on the American Flag</p>
<p>Recently, Hawaii has been resolved by the U.S. Congress to be changed into one of the states of the United States. I don't know how this forty-ninth star will be placed on the American flag: will it be arranged according to the upper picture, the middle picture, or the lower picture?</p>
<h3>Victory Song of Eastern Longdong: Iron and Blood Strength to Stabilize the Northwest</h3>
<p>— Qinghai 20th by Airmail, by Xu Tangying</p>
<p>Eastern Longdong is a pocket-shaped mountainous region bordering Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. Strategically, it is a vital chokepoint with a dense population and flourishing crops. Unfortunately, many areas in this region have been ravaged by destructive and murderous communist bandits who have occupied them for over a decade, leaving ten out of ten houses empty and the land barren. In broad daylight, one often sees naked young girls and children, and even adults struggle to maintain proper attire. While such sights may exist elsewhere, they are not as prevalent and deeply ingrained as in Eastern Longdong. In April of this year, the National Army's 82nd Division and the 8th Cavalry Brigade arrived from Qinghai to garrison the area, stationed in Qinyang, Heshui, and Ningxian, closely monitoring and preventing the westward advance of the communist bandits. Upon arriving in Eastern Longdong, the first thing the 82nd Division and its units witnessed was the tragic situation of the people under years of oppressive communist rule and brutal cruelty. Therefore, the officers and soldiers of the National Army's 82nd Division took special care of the people, refraining from occupying civilian houses, using civilian goods, or conscripting civilian laborers during their relocation. This earned them high praise from the people, which was rare in the past. Previously, when the communist bandits occupied Eastern Longdong, they not only took food and clothing from the people but also forcibly requisitioned shoes, socks, and fodder. All items taken by the communist bandits were never paid for. Under such blatant exploitation, the people of Eastern Longdong had a very negative impression of the communist bandits and believed that soldiers were entitled to take everything without compensation. However, after the National Army's 82nd Division arrived, under the strict discipline of Commander Ma Shaoxiang and his benevolent treatment of the people, all transactions were conducted fairly. This already moved the people of Eastern Longdong to tears of gratitude. When the National Army even paid for the firewood and grass they used at prices higher than the market rate, the people felt it was a miracle. In just over a month, their love and respect for the National Army grew increasingly earnest. This clearly demonstrates the depth of the communist bandits' exploitation of the people of Eastern Longdong over the past decade.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although the communist bandits constantly chanted slogans of democracy and freedom in Eastern Longdong, in reality, they were extremely autocratic and tyrannical. They arbitrarily used pretexts to kill local gentry and village chiefs, accusing them of being Kuomintang spies or providing firewood and grass to the Chiang Kai-shek army. They used intimidation, oppression, and murder to control the people, leaving their lives completely unprotected. At the same time, they absolutely forbade the people from speaking out. We often saw people being brutally murdered for occasionally discussing the Communist Party. When they spoke to each other, even without a third party present, they would cover their ears to speak to those they trusted. If you asked the local people about the past, they would simply weep silently. Therefore, we simply cannot understand how the Communist Party's behavior differs from Qin Shi Huang's "even discussing is punishable by death".</p>
<p>Cities Can Be Conquered, But Not Hearts</p>
<p>When the National Army first arrived in Eastern Longdong, the officers and soldiers were somewhat wary and suspicious of the people of Eastern Longdong, who had been subjected to over a decade of communist indoctrination. However, the facts told us that the honest and hardworking nature of the people of Eastern Longdong remained pure and flawless, and they were all able to follow good examples and steadfastly adhere to what is right. They all had a fair judgment in their hearts and had not lost their conscience to distinguish between right and wrong. When they saw the strict military discipline and the deep care for the people displayed by the officers and soldiers of the National Army's 82nd Division and the 8th Cavalry Brigade, they immediately knew who were the armies serving the country and the people, and who were the bandits harming the country and the people. Therefore, they decided to choose what was right and support the National Army's 82nd Division to fight against their enemy, the Communist Party. This was the revival of the conscience of the people of Eastern Longdong, and it was also the great achievement of the National Army's 82nd Division and the 8th Cavalry Brigade, who rescued the people of Eastern Longdong from the depths of misery. Therefore, the National Army loved the people, and the people were close to the army. At the same time, they poured out their hearts and did their best to help. This spirit of the army and the people working together to defend the country was especially evident in the Battle of Heshui. When the communist bandit Wang Zizai led his 12th Brigade to attack Heshui, our defending force consisted of only 600 officers and soldiers of the 8th Cavalry Brigade led by Ma Shengzhi. The disparity in numbers made it difficult to fulfill the defense mission. However, the National Army's 82nd Division used all available civilian manpower. On May 29th, when the communists attacked Heshui, many compatriots had already come from afar to report the movements, numbers, weapons, and other intelligence of the communist bandits to the National Army, allowing the National Army to prepare calmly and be confident of victory. Once the war broke out fiercely, tens of thousands of communist bandits swarmed from all over the mountains and fields, besieging the city walls of Heshui with intense firepower. Our army, led by Ma Shengzhi, fought bravely, repelling the enemy with one against a hundred, and managed to defend the city walls for three days. Initially, when our National Army fought the enemy, the people of Eastern Longdong were intimidated by the large number of communist bandits and had no faith in the National Army's ability to win with fewer troops. However, when the National Army soldiers fought bravely and charged into battle, causing the communist bandits to repeatedly lose battles and hesitate to advance, the people of Eastern Longdong believed that the officers and soldiers of the National Army's 82nd Division were indeed elite troops of national defense and were sure to win. This confidence was strengthened and established. Therefore, they went from sympathizing with the National Army to admiring the National Army, and from admiring the National Army to actually helping the National Army. Therefore, in the battlefield where bullets flew and flesh and blood were scattered, they risked their lives, regardless of gender or age, and voluntarily cooked meals and fed fodder to the fighting National Army soldiers. Because the cooks and grooms who were on internal duty at this time had all reinforced the front lines to fight and could not come down to cook, all the internal duties were taken over by them. They not only made tea and delivered food and fodder to the National Army, but also cared for the wounded, bandaging their wounds, and became nurses and stretcher-bearers for the National Army. At this time, the defense force of Heshui was no longer the battalion led by Ma Shengzhi, but the entire city of Heshui, united in spirit. In the end, they annihilated more than 5,000 stubborn bandits, and their main force was also defeated. As the saying goes, "When everyone is of one mind, even a mountain can be moved." This can be said to be a realistic portrayal of the army and the people of Heshui in this great battle to defend Heshui.</p>
<p>Helping the Local Government Rebuild the Political and Educational Systems of Eastern Longdong</p>
<p>The National Army's 82nd Division was not only able to win the hearts of the people and defeat the enemy, but also did a lot of great work in Eastern Longdong. Now that the crops are ripe, the army is helping the people harvest their fields. When the people are hungry, the National Army generously provides relief. After recovering Pankezhen, the National Army seized a large amount of grain from the communist army and distributed it unconditionally to the local poor people. In order to get to the root of the problem and eliminate the bandits, they cooperated with the local government to organize Baojia. In this regard, the results were great. At the same time, due to years of war in various parts of Eastern Longdong, the local area was impoverished, and the government had almost no time to care for education. Therefore, it was difficult for all schools to maintain themselves. Seeing this situation, Commander Ma Shaoxiang generously donated money to subsidize them, allowing education in Eastern Longdong to regain vitality. These few major events were truly the greatest happiness for the people of Eastern Longdong.</p>
<p>After the Battle of Heshui, tens of thousands of refugees immediately appeared in Eastern Longdong. Although the National Army has done its utmost to provide relief, the central government still needs to find a way. In addition, the National Army's cavalry damaged civilian fields due to the war. General Ma Shaoxiang believed that this was an unprovoked loss for the people, so he specially allocated 12 million yuan as compensation for the landowners' losses. The people were moved to tears when they received the compensation.</p>
<p>Strengthening the National Army's Equipment to Strive for Greater Victory</p>
<p>Most of the officers and soldiers of the National Army's 82nd Division are valiant warriors from Hezhou. They are all trained and guided by Deputy Director Ma Bufang. Every time they win a battle, they often say: "We feel that we are worthy of the country and the people, but we are only sorry for the Deputy Director, because we have not yet fully utilized the skills and training that the Deputy Director has given us." From this, we can know how bright and promising the future of the National Army's 82nd Division is, and how immortal Deputy Director Ma's achievement in training soldiers is.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire war situation in Eastern Longdong, I feel that all the measures taken in this area make us feel at ease, because there is an iron-clad force of stability here. It has restored the broken hearts of the people, boosted the morale of the demoralized, and re-ignited our national spirit and fighting spirit. However, the spiritual component of this stabilizing force accounts for the major part. As for the material equipment, it is very poor. We dare to sincerely hope and earnestly appeal that the authorities in charge quickly enrich and strengthen the material foundation of this stabilizing force, such as combat equipment. This will surely be of great benefit to the work of suppressing the rebellion and saving the country. This is the hope of the people of Eastern Longdong, and it is also the only measure to stabilize the overall situation in the west and quell the internal rebellion. We hope that the central government will pay serious attention to this and take action.</p>
<p>Now, the National Army's 82nd Division and the 8th Cavalry Brigade are still calmly stationed in Eastern Longdong. The cooperation between the army and the people prevents the communist bandits from daring to cross the Lei Pond. We are even more confident that the 82nd Division and the 8th Cavalry Brigade will continue to progress and achieve great victories in the future.</p>
<h3>Record of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway</h3>
<p>— Wuzhou 18th by Airmail, by Our Reporter Liang Xiaozhong</p>
<p>A withered artery, after a series of connections, has returned from death to vigorous growth. Although it will still take a more arduous time to complete the entire line, it will surely grow more vigorously. The completion of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, which is expected to start from Zhanjiang in the east, reach Guiyang in the north, and connect to Liuzhou to reach Hengyang, joining the Yue-Han Railway to facilitate the development of rich resources in the southwest, is already within reach. The Zhanjiang line, from Laibin in southern Guangxi through Guixian and Wanglin to Guangzhou Bay (Zhanjiang), has already established two engineering offices to actively carry out surveying. The total length is 390 kilometers (300 kilometers in Guangxi), and it will be completed within two years (because a part of the roadbed was built at the beginning of the war of resistance, and the terrain along the way is flat, so it is not difficult to complete it in one go). Moreover, I heard that the transportation authorities are actively engaged in port development in Guangzhou Bay, with the intention of making Zhanjiang City a gateway port for the southwest. If the project is successful, the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which has been operated by a country without a setting sun, will pale in comparison. We can wait and see.</p>
<p>The last and most difficult project of the entire line is the 150 kilometers from Duyun in Guizhou to Guiyang. The mountains rise and fall, and there are cliffs and precipices, most of which are narrow and dangerous paths. Some tunnel excavations are as long as 1,000 meters, and the total length of the tunnels in the entire section is 6 kilometers, with a total of 37. The originally planned Dongshanping Tunnel passing through the side of Yunwu Mountain needs to be excavated for two and a half kilometers before it can pass through. The vast amount of money required is unimaginable, so it is necessary to change the route to another road, passing through Gaojiaqiao along the highway to Guiding. Although the road is 7 kilometers longer, it saves nearly 1,000 meters of tunnel construction. As for bridge construction, it cannot be successful in a short period of time. In the more than 100 kilometers of road section, there are as many as 25 large bridges and 125 small bridges, with a total length of more than 2,000 meters. The Guiding Bridge alone is 180 meters long, and the bridge pillars are as high as 45 meters. The water flow is turbulent, the foundation is difficult to lay, and the cost is high. However, the transportation authorities also pay special attention to this section of the road, and specially allocated 8.4 billion yuan for construction. Since construction began in early October last year, it has now reached September. The earthwork project has been completed. In the future, after the road is opened to traffic, Guiyang will become the center of the southwest railway network (Yun-Qian Road, Chuan-Qian Road, Xiang-Gui-Qian Road). Going north to the frontier and south to the sea, and going back to Beijing and Shanghai, can be achieved in the near future. Its importance can be imagined.</p>
<p>The Xiang-Gui-Qian Road runs across four provinces, starting from Hengyang in the north, reaching Duyun in the west, passing through Guilin and Liuzhou in the middle, and branching to Zhanjiang. The total length is more than 1,000 kilometers. If it is successfully built in two years, it is already expected that the long-barren southwest will change its old appearance. The barren mountains of Guizhou and Guangxi are rich in reserves necessary for the development of heavy industry. From Guangxi's gold, silver, lead, steel, tungsten, tin, iron, and sulfur to Guizhou's coal, iron, copper, mercury, oil, antimony, and lead, as well as the deep wood and special products of the two provinces (such as Guangxi's fennel and Guizhou's mercury), can be transferred to the southeast industrial area in an instant, and the benefits of coastal fishing and salt can be distributed to the mountainous countries in the southwest, so that the people of Guizhou will no longer have to scrape the ground to survive. On the one hand, it facilitates the flow of goods, and on the other hand, it has a deeper meaning in promoting the development of southwest culture. Furthermore, in the event of trouble in the southern border, military resources can be quickly mobilized. The road bears the heavy responsibilities of economy, culture, and national defense. Its importance can be imagined. Especially if the railway plan of the Ministry of Communications is completed in the future (the original plan was: (1) to repair the existing railways in the northeast, southeast, and central plains, (2) to build new railways in the southwest and northwest provinces), with Guiyang as the center, there will be as many as five railways running across the southwest provinces. Once the entire line is open, the veins will run smoothly, and the blood circulation will be unblocked. It is truly full of vitality and prosperity is expected. We cannot help but pay our highest respects to the millions of nameless heroes who are buried in the road!</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation</h3>
<p>Legal Interpretation</p>
<p>Family quarrels frequently occur. Wife has an affair and does not listen to her husband's advice.</p>
<p>Editor: My wife, XXX, has always been extremely undisciplined. After more than a year of marriage, our relationship has deteriorated. She goes out every day and returns late at night. Sometimes she doesn't even return all night. When I question her slightly, I am always met with harsh words. She says, "This is my freedom, and you don't need to interfere." Recently, her affair has reached the point where they are communicating by letter. The letter contains phrases such as, "You are the most beautiful woman in the world." To hide her identity, she uses the alias "Liang Ping." I have always treated her well. In addition to providing her with plenty of food and clothing, I also give her several hundred thousand yuan for her personal use every month. I fulfill her every request, but she is so shameless. It is truly infuriating! Therefore, quarrels frequently occur in our family. Every time after a quarrel, she always threatens to commit suicide and has purchased several bottles of Lysol for that purpose, so there is no peace at home. I have suffered a great mental blow. Because I cannot resolve the matter, I told her mother, who said to let her be and not to pay attention to her. Because I am unfamiliar with the law, I have several questions. Please ask your newspaper's legal advisor to answer them. (1) Based on the letters from her affair partner, is there any suspicion that they have exceeded the bounds of friendship? (2) If she actually commits suicide, what legal responsibility will I bear?</p>
<p>[Answer by Lawyer Zhu Yabo] (1) Based on the words in the letter from her boyfriend, there seems to be suspicion of exceeding ordinary friendship. (2) The responsibility should be determined based on the motive and environment of her suicide, and whether there was any coercion or inducement.</p>

<h3>Industrial alcohol disguised as local alcohol</h3>
<p>[Reader Opinion] Recently, a large number of industrial alcohol disguised as local alcohol has been discovered on the market. If this continues, it will not only harm national tax revenue, hinder the business of brewers, and harm the health of consumers, but it is also very important. I would like to ask your newspaper to disclose this matter, hoping that the governing authorities will strictly crack down on it. I also hope that all firms in the industry will pay attention to this matter.</p>

<h3>New Trends in Modern Democratic Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>— Critical Remarks</p>
<p>Author: Yang Youjiong</p>
<p>Publisher: Commercial Press</p>
<p>First Edition: August, Year Thirty-Five</p>
<p>Total Pages: 108</p>
<p>The author, Mr. Yang Youjiong, is a Chinese political theorist and constitutional scholar who has made significant contributions to the promotion of people's livelihood and constitutionalism in China. He has served as a professor of political science at various universities and has authored books such as "A History of the Founding of the Soviet Union" and "Principles of National Construction." "New Trends in Modern Democratic Constitutionalism" describes the recent trends in democratic constitutionalism in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and continental Europe, serving as a reference for China's implementation of constitutionalism. On the eve of the implementation of democratic constitutionalism, all Chinese people should have a clear understanding of the current state of democratic constitutionalism in the world as a point of reference. It must be understood that the implementation of democratic constitutionalism is not a simple matter; this arduous task requires continuous learning, and learning from practice. It cannot be achieved through empty talk, and it is certainly not a deceptive facade.</p>
<p>The book begins by describing the general trend of the evolution of modern democratic politics. He says that the present world is a new era of democracy, and the political tide is the most turbulent and magnificent. The idea of democratic politics has successfully become the highest principle of national construction followed by countries since the 19th century. However, the biggest obstacle to the democratic political movement in the past was the unequal distribution of wealth, which led to a situation of conflict between the rich and the poor. After this war, countries around the world should have a good opportunity to establish a fair and reasonable democratic society. The most important task for democratic countries in the future should be to strive for the balanced distribution of property rights so that everyone's life becomes more stable. A prominent phenomenon in the history of democratic politics in recent decades is the gradual evolution from narrow electoral bases, indirect elections, and unequal suffrage to universal suffrage, direct and equal universal suffrage. Only then can the true stage of democratic politics be reached.</p>
<p>In the second chapter, the author discusses the characteristics and essence of British constitutionalism. The United Kingdom is the homeland of the constitutional system, and the British constitution is a model for the constitutionalism of various countries. However, the British constitution is not a written document but refers to the entire structure including the complete and orderly current political system. Reforms in the British constitution do not have to wait for a revolution to occur before they can be implemented, but are the product of a long historical development. Therefore, the author says: "When we discuss the British constitution, we should not necessarily limit ourselves to specific systems in a certain period, but should include the organization and system of the entire people's life as the object."</p>
<p>The British constitution includes five important factors: (1) Several documents with regulatory properties in history, such as the "Magna Carta," "Petition of Right," "Bill of Rights," etc.; (2) All laws enacted in Parliament, such as determining the power of the king, protecting the rights of the people, and promoting suffrage; (3) All court judgments; (4) The principles and provisions of "common law," most of which are about the duties, powers, methods of execution of the government, and the relationship between various agencies, etc.; (5) Conventions.</p>
<p>The third chapter explains the trends and current forces of American constitutionalism. The characteristics of the American constitution: First, most of it includes documents granting power and prohibiting power; second, the scope of individual freedom it plans is placed under the supervision of the judicial organs to prevent it from being violated by the government. The basic principles of people's constitutionalism established in the American constitution: First, recognize the sovereignty of the people, and the establishment of the government should be based on the principle of conforming to public opinion; second, the power enjoyed by the federal government is limited to that granted in the constitution.</p>
<p>The American constitutional system is based on the two-party system for its operation. The purpose of a political party is to gain power, and the only way to gain power is to get the votes of the majority of the people in the election. The new development of American political theory is not only to seek political freedom and equality before the law, but also to expect the world to be built on the four basic freedoms of mankind. These four freedoms are: (1) freedom of speech, (2) freedom of belief, (3) freedom from fear, (4) freedom from want. Its ideal is to establish a system of social security through international economic cooperation.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter discusses the evolution and characteristics of the Soviet constitution. The characteristics of the Soviet constitution: First, the theory on which its political system is based, that is, the highest principle in law and politics, is to take the dictatorship of the proletariat as the group of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet as the political system of the Soviet Union; second, it is an extremely flexible constitution, which can be amended by the usual legislative procedures. The new Soviet constitution is moving towards democracy. At the Seventh Soviet Congress in 1935, two principles were decided to amend the constitution: (1) to make the electoral system more democratic, to replace the incompletely equal elections with equal elections, to replace the multi-level elections with direct elections, and to replace the open elections with secret elections; (2) To determine the socio-economic basis of the constitution, so that the constitution is suitable for the mutual relationship of the forces of the Soviet stage. The new constitution first stipulates that the Soviet Union is a socialist country of workers and peasants: its political foundation is the Soviet of Workers' Representatives, and all political power belongs to the workers represented by the Soviet; its economic foundation is the socialist public ownership of the means of production and the socialist organization of the national economy, and private ownership is determined by the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work."</p>
<p>Finally, the author briefly describes the evolution of French democratic constitutionalism and the collapse of German democratic politics, and then analyzes the constitutional trends of various countries in the First World War and the new trends in democratic constitutionalism in the future to make the democratic system more perfect and make the people of the world have a stable and happy life.</p>
<p>I only intend to raise two opinions about this book. First, although the author separately criticizes the gains and losses of constitutionalism in various countries, he fails to make a comprehensive review of the overall trend of democratic constitutionalism in the world in the future and point out a general route. Second, regarding the principles and implementation of Chinese democratic constitutionalism, the author has not mentioned it at all, and we feel that he should give a brief direction. Although he has already stated it in other works, we believe that the fact that this point has not been actually touched upon in this book is a defect.</p>
<h3>Maurois' Biography of Dickens</h3>
<p>— Xiang Xiu</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago, when we in the literary world were still very unfamiliar with literary giants such as Shakespeare, Goethe, and even Balzac and Tolstoy, Dickens was already very familiar to us. Our readers, relying on Lin Qinnan's translation who did not understand English, read novels such as "The Old Curiosity Shop," "The Story of Little Nell," "The Personal History of David Copperfield," and "A Tale of Two Cities" with curiosity and excitement, and were amazed by the rich and humorous life of the British people, while being subjected to various mental tortures by this passionate author and infected by his humanitarianism. However, at that time, there were very few who could truly understand the founder of British 19th-century realism, because no one had introduced the texts to understand Dickens's life. After this long period of time, today we have the opportunity to read Xu Tianhong's translations of masterpieces such as "David Copperfield" and "A Tale of Two Cities." At the same time, we also read Maurois's "Biography of Dickens." This biography is as brilliant as Dickens's works. The author is a famous contemporary French novelist. His painting "French Tragedy" was once popular in our reading circles. His "Biography of Shelley" was also well-known.</p>
<p>Biography is also a kind of great creation. The author must first deeply understand the character's life, environment, thoughts, historical background, and historical trends. Only after being familiar with his social environment, and then grasping the root of his personality development and the path of his creation, and assessing the impact of his works on the contemporary and future generations, can he make appropriate judgments. This kind of biography is not only a dry historical record, but also the author's arduous artistic creation.</p>
<p>A beautiful biography of a character is itself a complete work of art. This contains the crystallization of the creation of two artists' minds. We have been deeply inspired by this when reading several biographies of heroes by Romain Rolland.</p>
<p>Dickens grew up in the early 19th century in England, when England was transforming from an agricultural society to an industrial society. He saw that the countryside was declining, urban material civilization was expanding, and the distance between the poor and the rich was getting farther and farther, forming an abnormal state of society. He himself was born in poverty, so his works always express sympathy for the poor and a deep satire and attack on contemporary society. But because he is a warm-hearted humanitarian, the way he takes criticism is a kind of sincere, passive naturalism. He advocates that the debtors' prison must be abolished, the poor people's training institute must be abolished, and the bad schools must be abolished, but what should be used to replace them? How to solve the poverty of the people, Dickens does not know. In this respect, he is quite similar to Tolstoy. Dickens uses his "tears" and "laughter" to accuse mankind. The angry laughter of the satirist, and the tears of anger for social injustice, are full in most of his works. On the other hand, Dickens is the founder of British realism in literary history. When the first third of the 19th century was the period when romanticism prevailed, Dickens's "The Pickwick Papers" surprised the romanticists at that time.</p>
<p>After Maurois analyzed Dickens's artistic life in detail, he also made a very interesting comparison of the characteristics of writers in various European countries. He said:</p>
<p>"Dickens provides us with an excellent opportunity to study this effect, which is a sense of humor. Imagine, if a group of writers of unknown nationality encountered a serious social crime, the cause of a disaster, or an absurd thing, what would happen? The Russians will sympathize with this absurd thing, describe it as a beloved friend, and then use "pity" to wipe it away. The Germans will build a hazy, metaphysical wall around it, and then use a poetic, romantic method to turn it into a goblin or a devil; after that, he will feel at ease inventing a very sophisticated machine to cut the devil into many small pieces. If an American is over thirty, he will say that there are no monsters in the world; if he is under thirty, he will say that there are tens of thousands of monsters. The French will preach to the monster and use it to say many jokes. The British will describe this thing in great detail and accuracy, explaining the size of its various organs, imitating its language and even its detailed expressions. At this time, the reader (or audience) will feel that the British writer is really enjoying describing terrible things or oppressible things. Then, suddenly there appeared a slightly distorted line or an obviously exaggerated word, which made people understand that there was a hidden smile in that solemn attitude. The entire terrifying anatomy, the anatomy that was so painstakingly created, will collapse in an instant—in a smile—and more importantly, it will remove the real monster for us."</p>
<p>What a profound and clever observation and comparison. In "Dickens Biography," Maurois expounded many extremely valuable insights. Before there is a better biography of Dickens, this is indeed an important reference book when reading Dickens's novels.</p>
<h3>Literary Handbook</h3>
<p>— Wang Huaide</p>
<p>(Author: Ai Wu, Publisher: Cultural Supply Agency)</p>
<p>There are many books on literary lectures that can be bought in the market, but they are either too difficult, making it difficult for learners without foundation to understand, or the materials are too poor, and there is no complete description of the theoretical system of literature. If you want to find a book that beginners can understand and are interested in reading, and can benefit a lot after reading it, it is as difficult as sifting gold from sand. Of course, the literary handbook is not perfect, but in my opinion, it is relatively satisfactory.</p>
<p>The author Ai Wu is the writer who is most able to use the most common and vulgar words to write novels, and his skill is clearly reflected in this book. Therefore, I think the literary handbook itself is a very worthy book. However, the theories in it are not just inherited from other people's old tunes. He himself has a lot of new insights that permeate it, and these insights are often thought-provoking and worthy of our careful study, and we still need to continue to explore them.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into three parts: the first discusses the essence of literature; the second discusses the tools and materials of literature; and the last dissects the actual creation.</p>
<p>The first part includes the least amount of text, only accounting for one-sixth of the entire book. It discusses the attitude of young people towards learning literature, the function of literature, the occurrence and development of literature, and other issues. In particular, the section "Who Literature Serves" says that "literature always serves the majority of people's happiness, speaks for the majority of people, defends the majority of people, and encourages the majority of people to fight for justice..." Compared with the saying that literature is "truth, goodness, and beauty," it is much more straightforward and delightful. For example, "What is the main function of literature?" The author believes that the first is that it can drive away our selfishness, make us have close concern for strangers, and arouse deep sympathy; the second is that it can drive away inherited concepts, and make us have a correct understanding of true life; and the last is that it can arm us, so that we do not compromise with evil forces. This view, after the author's examples, makes people feel the same. Every time he talks about the difficulties of learning literature, the author always earnestly persuades young people to work hard to overcome them, and the feeling of intimacy is obvious on the paper.</p>
<p>The second part discusses "How We Should Collect Words," and has incisive arguments; from various propositions, we know that the author has put some effort into this aspect. For example, "How We Should Record the Language of the People" is also written quite well. There is also "The Characteristics of the Oral Language of the People," and the author believes that "the prefix is rich," and gives many examples, such as "...very sour, called "slippery sour", very sweet, called "honey sweet", very spicy, called "flying spicy", very painful, called "essence pain", very poisonous, called "widow poison", very far, called "old far"..." Once pointed out, it is felt that we rarely use it in our articles, which is a pity. "Rich in concrete image," such as "If you don't succeed in talking to someone, you will be scolded a few words, called "bump your nose with ashes". Originally, it was said that "it is difficult to protect oneself"...but you still have to add "clay bodhisattva crossing the river" to describe it." These are concrete examples that people can easily understand. "Rich in connotation," such as... the person who buys beef said: "Hey, did you soak water in this beef?" The person who sells beef said: "Nonsense! The best, soaked in water!" The person who buys beef answered: "It's the best! There are benches in the provincial government for you to sit on." The last sentence is implicit,...if you say directly: "The government will arrest you and lock you up." That would provoke the other party to be ashamed and angry, and might even resort to violence." What a funny example! Other problems are also discussed a lot, and I don't want to explain them one by one here.</p>
<p>The third part of "What Are the Main Conditions for Creation," "How to Write Characters in Works," "Creating Typical Characters and Individuality," "How to Write Characters' Speeches," "How to Write Background," etc., all have simple and clear explanations. But the most important thing is "What is the creative process like?", and Lu Xun's "Medicine" is used as material for analysis.</p>
<p>I don't intend to make a big record for the literary handbook, because that is still useless to the reader. If you are willing to carefully read this book, I think that in our minds, there must be a clear outline of literature. In fact, no matter how small the problem is, the author has the appropriate convenience to help you understand it; you remember that example, and you have a thorough understanding of the theory.</p>
<p>In short, the literary handbook is a simple and popular book, and it is valuable—for young literary learners.</p>
<p>Dickens (Charles Dickens, 1812-1870)</p>
<h3>Marshall's Economic Theory</h3>
<p>— Gu Wenbin</p>
<p>Written by Zhu Baoyi, published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>In economics, there is Marshall, just like Beethoven in music, Kant in philosophy, and Newton and Einstein in physics. The economics textbooks currently used in universities, eighty or ninety percent of them are based on Marshall's economic theory, and ten or twelve percent are developed under the influence of Marshall.</p>
<p>Since Marshall's economic theory occupies such an important position in economics, then his achievements should be familiar and studied by everyone who studies economics. However, in fact, this is not the case. In China, few people who study economics, except for a few graduate students, have directly read Marshall's original works, and few have a clear concept of the entire system of Marshall's theory. The reason is that Marshall's original works are vast, and there is no introductory book in Chinese to introduce them to people whose theoretical cultivation is not yet in-depth.</p>
<p>Recently, I read the book "Marshall's Economic Theory" (compiled by Zhu Baoyi) published by the Commercial Press, which can be said to satisfy my many years of desire. This is a concise and powerful introductory book. The book is not long, only more than one hundred pages, and it gives a clear description of Marshall's complex and diverse theoretical system. There are very few direct quotations from the original text in the book, and the editor explains them in a third-person tone. In the part of introducing the theory, in addition to describing Marshall's own theory, it also introduces the origin of the theory, the contributions of scholars before Marshall, and the criticisms and revisions of scholars after Marshall, so you can see the process of the gradual change of economic theory. The editor must be someone who is willing to spend time collecting information before writing.</p>
<p>What is regrettable is that there are many typos in the book, and especially many errors in punctuation, and I hope the editor can correct them in the next edition!</p>
<p>In today's world where the flames of war are raging and prices are fluctuating, I am afraid that there are still many people who are willing to read some meaningful books in the summer. I would like to recommend this small book to students who love economics.</p>
<h3>Reading "Rudin"</h3>
<p>— Shu Zhang</p>
<p>"Rudin" is the first novel in Turgenev's series of six interconnected novels, a foundational introduction to the subsequent works. They are used by the author to express the intellectual currents of an era and to report on the social dynamics of the time. Particularly, the author's clumsy yet elegant romantic style and his cultivation in various arts have attracted many readers, enchanted countless young people, and established his position in the literary world.</p>
<p>From "Rudin," we can see the social conditions of that time and even find the sprouts of nascent social and political movements. The darkness of the era in which the protagonist lived was no less than today's, perhaps even more so. At that time, the notorious tyrant Nicholas I was in power, cruel and authoritarian. Advanced young intellectuals naturally gathered together to form a group, and Rudin was one of them. This kind of group was a real and deeply meaningful historical fact. They praised truth, art, and the god of morality.</p>
<p>However, these people, living in philosophical contemplation and abstract ideals, were completely unsuitable when it came to actually doing things. Empty talkers are ultimately of no help. Like rootless duckweed, they are forever destined to drift and have a miserable fate. No wonder the author arranged an inglorious ending for the protagonist in the book.</p>
<p>"Rudin" is a book that expresses this theme. Its structure is exceptionally simple, and the content is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Dmitri Rudin is a thirty-five-year-old Russian landowner, not wealthy. Through the relationship with his friend, the Lefnef Baron, he gets acquainted with a noblewoman, Darya Mikhailovna. On the evening of that visit, at Darya's house after dinner, Rudin displays his eloquent talent, defeating Pigasov, Darya's neighbor, a skeptic who despises truth and culture, who has always been unrivaled in his outspokenness. He wins the sincere admiration and respect of everyone present, the hostess and the neighbors. His endless flow of words, his invincible eloquence, his rich thoughts, and his fiery passion make the hostess feel that she had met him too late, and she sincerely invites him to stay at her country villa.</p>
<p>In the morning, he goes to the hostess's room for tea. During the conversation, a local landowner, Lezhnyov, visits the hostess to discuss the issue of their boundary lines. He is Rudin's former classmate from university, and they had a close friendship, but later separated due to repeated misunderstandings. This meeting still involves a slight debate.</p>
<p>Rudin comes out of the room and encounters the hostess's daughter in the corridor, the seventeen-year-old beautiful Natalya, a pragmatic, passionate girl with a heroic spirit, and her teacher, Miss Pengof, accompanying them for a walk in the garden. The hearts of the two young people both sprout the seeds of love, which causes the unusual jealousy of her usual admirer, Volyntsev.</p>
<p>His heart is heavy, and he slips away from dinner, returning to his widowed sister Alexandra's room. Lezhnyov is sitting with her—they had also loved each other for a long time and later got married—and Lezhnyov is talking about Rudin's family background and his youth, disapproving of his behavior and criticizing his high-flown talk of lofty purity.</p>
<p>One morning two months later, Natalya meets Rudin again in the garden. He hints at his love for her, as agreed, bewildering her. She even runs past Volyntsev without noticing. At the breakfast table, Volyntsev, under the guise of a pretext, sharply satirizes Rudin, causing an uproar, but Rudin actually tolerates it and does not retort.</p>
<p>After the meal, Rudin secretly arranges to meet Natalya in the garden in the evening. This time, he nakedly pours out his accumulated love, and the flames of passion ignite her heart. She bravely replies that she loves him too, and they part hurriedly. Rudin congratulates himself on his happiness, but misfortune immediately befalls him.</p>
<p>Poddalevsky, the hostess's secretary, a flattering little man, peeps at this scene from the bushes and secretly informs the hostess. From then on, the situation changes. Rudin is no longer treated as a welcome guest, but is met with coldness, and Natalya is difficult to meet. That evening, he receives her secret letter asking him to make their final farewell by the Afdu Pond the next morning.</p>
<p>That day, Natalya tells Rudin that her mother firmly opposes their love and wants her to break up with him. When she asks him what countermeasures he has, he timidly says, "Only to obey fate." Therefore, she bitterly denounces his empty talk of independence and sacrifice, saying that he is just a coward who only stirs up love affairs because he is bored. Sadly, she turns around and runs away without hesitation.</p>
<p>Rudin returns in frustration. He writes farewell letters, one to Volyntsev and one to Natalya. That evening, he bids farewell to the hostess and sets off to return to his own estate.</p>
<p>Two years later, news comes that Volyntsev and Natalya are engaged in Moscow. Several years pass. In the first-class hotel in the town of Tebuff, Lezhnyov unexpectedly meets Rudin, who is down on his luck. They restore their old friendship. During dinner, Rudin tells of his wandering life since their separation and the failures of his various undertakings. Time has passed, and he has achieved nothing. He is no longer the eloquent orator he once was. Exhausted and distressed, he admits that he can only talk emptily and will inevitably fail and have a bad ending. Then they part.</p>
<p>Yes, he did not have a good ending. In the July 1848 battle of the Paris Revolution, the Red Republicans were almost completely wiped out. The last one to die was a Polish party member, and this Polish party member was Dmitri Rudin.</p>
<p>The protagonist Rudin is a typical figure of that era, representing the many young people at that time who were full of hot blood and eagerly sought truth and reform. He is a hero of the era and also its victim. He is a braggart without shame, truly a giant when it comes to speaking, but a dwarf when it comes to doing things. He is as eloquent as Demosthenes, but as soon as he joins a difficult test, he immediately loses face and fails.</p>
<p>Is this not exactly the same as the young people we can encounter more than once in the era we are in now? But, please note, Rudin represents 1840, a century ago. How have people progressed since then—which can be found in the protagonist Lavretsky in the second novel "A Nest of Gentlefolk"—to the achievements of a country like today? And what about us? How will we compare and distinguish ourselves?</p>
<p>Dear readers, here, I sincerely introduce this book, "Rudin."</p>

<h3>Cliques and Others</h3>
<p>— Shi Lang</p>
<p>Although Shanghai is chaotic and complex, careful scrutiny reveals that it is orderly. For example, those who push wheelbarrows on the bridge have a specific area, a specific time, and a specific boss; they cannot mess around. Similarly, pickpockets, beggars, and stallholders all have their own remembered cliques and bosses. These bosses are the masters of Shanghai's lower classes. They pay for their own heaven, their own world, their own masses. Everyone is organized and absolutely obeys and follows the rules.</p>
<p>If something happens in a certain area, "follow the map to find the horse"; as long as the boss pats you on the chest, it is a law, an absolutely effective promise. Therefore, if you understand Shanghai, you will not find Shanghai so mysterious or so chaotic.</p>
<p>However, from the opposite perspective, they are absolutely believers in "cliquism" and "turf rights." They are also deeply rooted and unbreakable in these cliques. You absolutely cannot change the outdated rules they have set. No one dares to encroach on their designated areas.</p>
<p>This is a cross-section of life in Shanghai and also a microcosm of Chinese society.</p>
<p>A friend came from XX and talked to me at length about the floating and sinking of officialdom. He felt very pained by the personnel disputes and the atmosphere of exclusion and infighting in the official arena. He said, "You only see 'cliques.' Each clique desperately tries to promote people within its own clique and excludes people from outside the clique from getting involved. So you have one system, and he has another system. They attack each other and hate each other. This situation is really heartbreaking."</p>
<p>In fact, my friend is a bit of an alarmist. Which place doesn't emphasize systems? Which corner isn't a clique? Look, if you want to push a wheelbarrow onto the bridge, and you are not under the command of this "boss," don't even think about getting five hundred yuan for the tunnel.</p>

<h3>Impression of Zuo Shunsheng</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhai</p>
<p>I often feel that a major characteristic of the China Youth Party is that it does not indulge in empty talk but seeks truth from facts—and, after a policy has been decided, it never looks left and right or hesitates to move forward. The people of the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party are not lacking in talent. When they hold meetings, they are eloquent, but it is difficult to reach a conclusion that is both initially and practically sound. As a result, they argue endlessly and remain deadlocked, and each tends toward extremes, eventually leading to a split. In comparison, the China Youth Party is truly much more "mature."</p>
<p>I think that the China Youth Party's ability to cultivate this spirit of facing reality should be attributed to good leadership. Last summer, when the major events of convening the National Assembly, drafting the Constitution, and expanding the foundation of the government were still being discussed, I separately interviewed several key figures from the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party under the scorching sun. Their opinions have already been published in the newspapers and, in today's view, have become relics of the past. However, one impression remains very vivid: the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party had many theories, grand and without substance; the China Youth Party immediately provided many concrete questions that were completely practical, and the one who spoke most frankly and had the clearest attitude was the current Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Zuo Shunsheng.</p>
<p>Mr. Zuo is very talkative and humorous. At that time, because he was not feeling well, he looked somewhat unkempt, with the demeanor of a celebrity. Indeed, the entrance of the China Youth Party headquarters on Haig Road was heavily guarded, and the guards were arrogant, making people hesitant to ask for instructions. However, the living room of Zuo's residence on Difeng Road was often filled with laughter and conversation, without any restraint—because the host often said, "This is just us talking among ourselves; there's no need to publish it in the newspapers." And the guests also respected the host's opinion.</p>
<p>Once, unintentionally, the topic turned to the proposal made by some people at that time to immediately and unconditionally cease fire. Mr. Zuo leaned back in the sofa and laughed, "Originally, when you win a lot at mahjong, you stand up and want to leave, not allowing others to continue playing—but will others who have lost money be willing not to try to win it back?"</p>
<p>In fact, the prelude to the war had not yet begun at that time. But Mr. Zuo affirmed very firmly and seriously, "Shandong and Shanxi are acute illnesses, and acute illnesses are easy to cure; the Northeast and Northwest, however, are chronic illnesses, and chronic illnesses must be treated carefully."</p>
<p>Mr. Zuo has finally taken office as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, but the talk of him heading the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has been around for a long time. When the authorities had just expressed their determination to expand the foundation of the government, the atmosphere of Mr. Zuo taking office immediately became strong again. So I went to visit him again, and he smiled with a frown, "It's the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry again! I don't know why, but there was this rumor in Chongqing, saying that I was going to take on the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and a reporter mentioned this in the newspaper. Oh, it really hurt me! So many letters of recommendation came!" He gestured with his hand, and the height of the pile of letters was probably between two and three feet.</p>
<p>However, the "rumor" ultimately became a reality. He once explained his difficulties frankly, "We participate in the government as a party, which is different from the situation of social dignitaries like Mr. Wang Yunwu participating in the government as individuals. We cannot but have many considerations. For example, we cannot disappoint the expectations of our comrades within the party. Moreover, after joining, will we be able to act freely? There are many, many difficulties. It is also not good for comrades to be concentrated in central agencies. We are competing as a political party, so we must make preparations in local governments as well."</p>
<p>Finally, in the newspapers these past few days, we have read the news that local governments are about to be reorganized in part.</p>
<p>The China Youth Party seems to be adopting a strategy of "advancing step by step and consolidating each position." Is Mr. Zuo's taking office and Li Youhuang's firm resignation as Minister of Economic Affairs two sides of the same strategy?</p>
<h3>Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>— Xu Jijing</p>
<p>Although it is still summer vacation, the tuition fee issue for the next semester has already become a concern for all parties. The education authorities have only a pitifully small amount of education funding to maintain a not-so-small education undertaking, which is indeed quite painstaking. In fact, to ensure that schools can survive well, collecting tuition and miscellaneous fees from students is a viable solution. However, in order to take into account the decline of the social economy and the burdens on student families, they have to restrict the fees charged by schools.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has set a standard for tuition and miscellaneous fees for public schools in the next semester (see this newspaper on the 14th). In terms of middle schools, a boarding high school student only needs to pay 87,000 yuan, which seems quite small in the current situation of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan per picul of rice. However, the problem for school administrators arises again, because the funds given by the government to public schools and the teachers' salaries are issued according to civil service standards. As everyone knows, civil servants' salaries are far from meeting their living needs. However, the salaries of teachers in general private schools are better, because their source of income is student fees. Therefore, in the general situation of the last semester, private school teachers' salaries were higher than those of public schools, which is a blow to public schools, because the reason why many public schools have their current status and achievements is mainly due to their possession of a group of excellent teachers. If this situation of unequal treatment continues, these teachers with more experience and knowledge will be in danger of slipping into private schools. To save this crisis, public schools then levy a "Respect-the-Teacher Fund," which, although should be a voluntary donation in nature, is in fact a mandatory levy, that is, a disguised tuition fee. The amount of the "Respect-the-Teacher Fund" in Jiangsu provincial schools, as far as I know, is one picul of rice. This money, as the name suggests, is of course used to increase teachers' salaries. However, according to statistical results, the ratio of teachers' salaries in public and private middle schools along the Beijing-Shanghai line in the last semester was 2:3, which means that private school teachers' income was one-half more than that of provincial schools. Now that the Ministry of Education stipulates that the "Respect-the-Teacher Fund" is not allowed to be collected next semester, I don't know how many public schools, especially several famous provincial schools, will solve this difficult problem.</p>
<p>The fees charged by private schools have already been eliminated hard restrictions in Shanghai, and it seems that all regions will follow suit. However, in this period of drastic price fluctuations, private schools are still hesitant to decide on the fee amount for the next semester. But according to the situation, this will be a very alarming amount. The main source of income for private schools is fees. In the current stage of high prices, it is impossible to unilaterally prevent tuition fees from rising. However, I hope that these fees can be collected reasonably and used reasonably. The so-called "collected reasonably" means that the amount should be reduced to the lowest possible limit. The so-called "used reasonably" means that the income should be used entirely for teachers' salaries and the maintenance of the school, that is, absolutely achieving "taken from students, used for students," and not for the benefit of a few private individuals. Only in this way will students and parents be willing to grit their teeth and accept it.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: We hope that relevant parties can specifically list the facts and propose discussions on this issue.)</p>
<h3>Miscellany of Travels in America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>In the movie theater</p>
<p>We might as well make a dogmatic definition: the more movie theaters there are in a place, the more developed the public education is, because movies have an educational function, and watching movies is easier to understand than reading dead books. The American education authorities have already integrated education and movies. Taking military education as an example, almost every hour of lectures is followed by a movie. Future education will use sight instead of mouth. Teachers can seal their mouths and still receive the effects of education. American movie theaters have almost become licorice root in medicine. Any small city or town has at least two movie theaters. Their movie theaters are small. Except for a few large cities, it is difficult to find a movie theater as grand as the Grand Theater. American movie theaters are the jewels under the chain system. Each movie trust owns one or two thousand movie theaters, so you can see Paramount Theatre, Fox Theatre, and Roxy Theatre everywhere. Movies start at 2 pm and continue until 11 pm. If you don't have air conditioning at home, you can buy a ticket and sit from 2 pm to 11 pm, and no one will kick you out. But Americans have a habit. Except for particularly good movies, they don't want to watch a second showing because it is not easy to arouse curiosity when watching a second showing. If you are not careful, all the impressions of the first showing will be ruined. You have to queue to buy tickets. Since there are no showings, people buying tickets do not stop. The long snake formation has always existed. The box office is along the street, and the ticket-buying queue is lined up on the sidewalk. If a good movie is showing, the queue starts from the box office and turns and winds all the way to the second street, even circling a few times, which is quite a spectacle. There is a small shop next to the box office, specializing in selling ice cream, fried rice, and candy. Each bag of fried rice costs two cents. American women especially like to eat it. It is bland and tasteless, and it is crisper than old cotton, making a soft sound. As soon as an American young lady enters the theater, she lies on the chair with her legs resting on the back of the seat in front, and she eats fake fried rice. They echo each other, which is a bit noisy, but there is one advantage: they no longer talk when they eat fried rice; otherwise, the order would be even more chaotic. People who are accustomed to living in Shanghai and have adopted the style of English gentlemen do not talk in movie theaters and wear swallowtail coats to banquets. Americans don't have that. As long as you don't yell in the movie theater, no one will interfere with you, but don't forget to take off your hat, otherwise someone in the back seat will yell Take it off or knock your headgear off with a coin. In American movie theaters, no one will interfere with you if you hook your arms around your female companion or have more exciting performances, because people watching movies have no reason to be distracted to watch performances other than movies.

<h3>The Life of Zhang Jiao</h3>
<p>— Zhou Leng</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Essays on Wei and Jin Dynasty Figures, Part Four</p>
<p>If Yu Ji was the theorist of the peasant movement at that time, then undoubtedly Zhang Jiao was the leader of this movement. Regarding Zhang Jiao's life deeds, there is a good report in the Biography of Huangfu Song in the Book of the Later Han:</p>
<p>"Initially, Zhang Jiao of Julu, calling himself the Great Virtuous Teacher, served the Yellow God's Way, and the people believed in him. Jiao sent his disciples in all directions to deceive people, and in more than ten years, he had hundreds of thousands of followers. Connecting counties and states, the people of Qing, Xu, You, Ji, Jing, Yang, Yan, and Yu eight states all responded. Zhang falsely claimed that the Azure Heaven was dead and the Yellow Heaven should be established, and he wrote in white soil on the gates of the capital city temples and the state and county government offices, and he also agreed with the Zhongchang attendant Feng Xu and Xu Feng to be his internal supporters. They agreed to rise up both inside and outside on the fifth day of the third month, but before they could rebel, the matter was exposed... When Jiao and others knew that the matter had been revealed, they sped to all sides day and night, rising up at the same time, all using yellow turbans as their sign. Within ten days, the world responded, and the capital was shaken."</p>
<p>Although this is a brief report, Zhang Jiao's character can already be seen from it. From his secret deployment to plan the uprising to his sudden action when the case was exposed, this skill and this courage could never have been done by a "demon thief" as most people think.</p>
<p>So, what was Zhang Jiao's political purpose? The best explanation is that they used the yellow market as a symbol. According to the Fifth Volume of the Book of Jin and the Record of Clothing, "The turban is made of kudzu vine, shaped like a Tao, and worn horizontally. It was the common clothing of the noble and the lowly in ancient times." In other words, isn't it very clearly expressed that they are breaking the concept of class and advocating human equality? Moreover, the Biography of Zhang Lu in the Shu Wei Book of the Records of the Three Kingdoms also states: "Zhang Lu occupied Hanzhong and taught the people with ghost ways, all teaching them to be honest and not to cheat. Those who were sick confessed their faults, which was mostly similar to the Yellow Turbans. He also set up 'righteous houses' and hung rice and meat in the righteous houses, allowing travelers to take as much as they needed, and if they took too much, ghost soldiers would punish them with disease." Thus, although their actions were heavily religious in color, aren't these actions denying private ownership and advocating common consumption?</p>
<p>Of course, these measures are not surprising today, but thousands of years ago, Zhang Jiao dared to make such a bold attempt in a society under the strict rule of landlords. Doesn't this idea and this action deserve our surprise? Accordingly, when Zhang Jiao's power spread, the representatives of the ruling forces, such as Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Yuan Shao, forgot their mutual opposition and concentrated their efforts to actively suppress them, and even after Zhang Jiao died, they had to dissect his coffin and mutilate his corpse. This can just explain who Zhang Jiao was after all, and explain that the contradiction of class is really above all reason.</p>
<h3>Bada Shanren</h3>
<p>— Ji Ming</p>
<p>The porcelain bowls and dishes sold in the market often bear the inscription "Bada Shanren." I once suspected its origin. After reading the biography of Bada Shanren, I suddenly realized it. It turns out that porcelain mostly comes from Jingde, and Jingde is close to Nanchang, which is the former residence of Shanren. According to Shanren, he was a descendant of the Ming Dynasty imperial family, and his name is lost. When he was young, he encountered the national upheaval and abandoned his family to become a monk, living in the mountains for more than twenty years. His followers once numbered in the hundreds. Later, he was hired by Magistrate Hu of Linchuan. After more than a year, he suddenly suffered from madness, tore his monk's robe, and burned it, pretending to be in the market, and no one could recognize him. His nephew took him to his home, and after a long time, he recovered.</p>
<p>Shanren was skilled in calligraphy and painting and also liked to drink alcohol, but he could not finish two liters. He would often go when poor scholars or butchers in the market invited him to drink. After going, he would often get drunk. After getting drunk, he would splash ink everywhere, not caring much about it. However, he could not be obtained by nobles who sought it with heavy gold. One day, he suddenly wrote the word "dumb" on the door and never spoke a word again. Shao Qingmen (Changheng) was a guest in Nanchang and saw Shanren at the Beilan Temple. They cut candles and talked at night, and they used brushes to write on the table to communicate with each other. His state of first being mad and then dumb was like this.</p>
<p>Shanren's first name as a monk was Xuetong, and he later changed his name to Renwu and Lvhan. He finally ended with the name Bada Shanren. Those who know Shanren today only know him as a calligrapher and painter, but they do not know that Shanren, living in the aftermath of a fallen country and continuing the chaos of mourning, suppressed his weeping, which was no less than that of Xie Die and Zheng Suonan. Alas.</p>
<p>Scientific Essays</p>
<h3>Aerial Dock (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Gu Junzheng</p>
<p>In short, if we consider the aerial dock as the starting point for space ships, all conditions are nearly ideal. Starting with an initial velocity of five miles per second, without air resistance, in fact, adding only another one and a half to two miles per second would be enough to escape Earth and head towards the Moon.</p>
<p>The proponent of this aerial dock is Von Pirquet. Pirquet's original intention was to create a base for exploration and travel within the solar system. Because the base itself has high speed, it can enable spaceships to gain more speed. Also, because the base is almost a vacuum, it can serve as a safe storage for liquid fuel. Those fuels, as long as they are not directly exposed to solar radiation (because radiation is enough to heat and evaporate the liquid), can be stored there for a long time, remaining unchanged.</p>
<p>The aerial dock also has many other characteristics, even if space travel is not undertaken, it still has its own value. Originally, the aerial dock, compared to the ground, has at least three important characteristics:</p>
<p>(1) This dock moves in a vacuum, and this vacuum is more complete and permanent than what can be created on the ground.</p>
<p>(2) It is easier to create the highest and lowest temperatures on this dock. Any object on it, if simply made of a surface covered with sodium metal flakes to reflect away the direct radiation of the sun, then its own heat will be dissipated in the form of radiation, cooling to near absolute zero within minutes, lower than the lowest temperature created in the laboratory. But on the other hand, it is easy to concentrate the sun's rays on an object there, heating it to a temperature exceeding that of an electric arc.</p>
<p>(3) This dock is unaffected by gravity.</p>
<p>Because the aerial dock has these three basic different conditions, if a researcher lives here, he can often complete experiments that cannot be completed on Earth. For example, an electronics expert can build a completely vacuum laboratory in this huge high vacuum. Physicists can study high and low temperatures, as well as solar and cosmic radiation that is not obscured by the air. Astronomers can install large telescopes here without worrying about their weight and without being hindered by the air. Whether biological and chemical phenomena are affected by gravity cannot be tested on the ground. Now, with this gravity-free aerial dock, biologists and chemists will certainly be happy to conduct planned research on this issue.</p>
<p>In addition, some people have proposed building three aerial docks on the same orbit, forming the three vertices of an equilateral triangle, to serve as relay stations for global radio and television. According to theoretical estimates, the cost of such relay stations would be less than building them on the ground. Others have proposed building a huge flat reflector on an aerial dock that orbits the Earth every twenty-four hours, to reflect the light of the sun, which has just set below the horizon, onto the ground to serve as nighttime lighting for large cities. If parabolic reflectors are used to concentrate sunlight and beam it to the ground, it could even change the climate of a region, create or eliminate storms, melt icebergs, and in times of war, it could even be used as an irresistible weapon against the enemy.</p>
<p>In short, the conditions on the aerial dock are completely new in human experience. Under new conditions, new results will be produced, which is beyond question. Therefore, if we have such a base for pure academic research, then new discoveries will inevitably emerge one after another, and perhaps one of those discoveries could repay all the expenses and more!</p>
