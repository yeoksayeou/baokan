<h3>蘇對華策略預示將有轉變</h3>
<p>〔合衆社南京廿九日電〕此間中立政治觀察家廿九日稱：莫斯科電台對國民黨及中國新憲法之抨擊，係莫斯科官方機構迄今對中國政府所作最强烈之攻擊，此即反映蘇聯對華策略上之轉變。渠等指出，蘇聯在中國境內控制之報紙，論述內戰的保持中立地位，極爲妥合，但在蘇聯境內之報章及電台，則已不諱言與中共採同一立塲。</p>

<h3>平行轅參長對外記者談　蘇助東北匪叛亂　國軍最後必能戰勝共匪</h3>
<p>〔聯合社北平廿八日電〕北平行轅參謀長徐啓明，廿八日向聯合社記者發表談話稱：蘇聯正以顧問人員，輕兵器及通訊設備，供給東北共匪。假使蘇聯能藉共產黨控制中國，則越南及緬甸，實際上整個東亞，均將不守，美國在遠東將僅有一個　國日本。中共領袖周恩來己準備赴莫斯科，磋商東北與蘇聯易貨辦法。國軍司令雖歡迎外援，亦知其並不足恃，但最後必能戰勝共匪。東北局勢甚爲緊張，預料瀋陽大戰，一星期內將在新民開始，惟確信瀋陽必能堅守，國軍在該處擁有充分兵力，僅北寗路關外段兵力較薄，故己增援綏中。共匪認爲有蘇聯援助，可以征服中國，但必須獲得中國人民之擁護，而中國人民皆怨恨共匪，在共區雖被迫服從，一有機會：即傾向國軍。徐氏不信共匪將攻擊平津，因國軍有充分兵力防守，此爲共匪所知，故其目標或爲保定，及破壞平綏鐵路。</p>

<h3>控訴東條英機</h3>
<p>遠東國際軍事法庭進行的個別審判，從本年八月四日開始到現在，已進入最後的也是最重要的階段。日本前首相東條英機，於本月二十日出庭受審，廿二日檢察官勃萊威德宣讀二百四十五頁之供詢，廿六日戰犯東條提出六萬言之自辯書，被吿律師淸瀨一郞博士則雄辯滔滔，竭力爲東條開脫，而日木少數報紙日來亦居然羣起爲之聲援。審判東條，爲審判一切戰犯的中心；東條戰罪的成立，卽爲一切戰犯罪行的成立。現在舉世注目於東條的審判，我們中國受日本軍閥的侵略最慘而又最深，東條對於中國的荼毒迫害，尤爲我四萬萬人所永記不忘。我們耍在國際法庭審判東條的今天，東條和淸瀨逞其雄辯滔滔的今天，應該根據事實和眞理，率直嚴正的控訴，我們更要全世界輿論也一致指控，爲眞理爲正義而指控，壓倒東條於神聖法律之前！</p>
<p>我們中國人是主張不念舊惡的，也是主張不爲已甚的。但在日寇侵華這一點上，對無辜的日本平民可以原諒，而對於戰犯，尤其罪魁禍首的戰犯如束條者却主張萬萬不可寬恕。東條英機爲日本軍閥的首魁，日本的軍人和重臣，信奉他爲「征夷大將軍」。他曾兩任近衛內閣的陸相，一九四一年十月更迫走近衛，自任首相。他是日本戰時內閣的主力，他的鐵掌可以指揮陸空大軍。日本的不斷侵略中國，卽由他主動：日本侵略緬越，攻擊珍珠港，發動所謂「大東亞戰爭」，又是他主謀。粉碎日本　會政治，實行軍人干政，建立法西政權，更是他的傑作。服　希望主義，與松關洋右輩合流參加三國同盟，向英美宣戰，而是他的主導。東條的罪行確鑿，刁鑽陰狠，世界聞名。戰敗後日本人士的著作，暴露軍閥橫行的罪責，也一致加諸於東條，不用檢察官的控訴而自知。東條是甲級戰犯的第一號，數其罪惡，世所未有，積威作孽，遠被四方。他的罪行，是日本軍閥罪行的集中。今天他縱有六萬言的自辯，和淸瀨一郞的雄辯滔滔，事實難逃，斷不容解脫他罪行的絲毫。全世界的人都是他的原吿，幷且也都是蒙受他罪行的證人！</p>
<p>東條在押年餘，於偷生自託中信仰佛敎，意圖轉移世人對他的痛惡。可是他的理性早已泯滅，今天雖以僞裝的佛心，發表狂論，逞其雄辯，意圖脫罪，我們相信國際法庭的法官，有良知，有理性，當決不受其欺騙，錯亂了自己的方寸。我們謹於此對東條和淸瀨的遁詞，加以痛斥，藉張正義。</p>
<p>一·東條立於國際法庭之前，承認他對太平洋戰爭及日本之失敗，應負全責：但不承認犯有任何罪行。他辯護偷襲珍珠港，是日本預先獲悉美國對日作戰的計劃，故日本之戰乃出於自衛。這是一派胡言。我們可以從「近衛日記」，田中隆吉「日本軍閥禍國眞相」，和森正藏「旋風二十年」等書中，指出太平洋之戰，是德義日三國同盟的結果，東條和松岡的旣定計劃。至於野村與羅斯福總統的談判，近衛與格魯大使的交涉，應不過意圖和綏日美緊張的情勢；但終因東條的梗阻而失敗。東條與松岡主張作孤注一擲，以　行對希特勒的諾言。他對近衛說：「人生有時不妨閉着眼冒一次險」！可是近衛畢竟因缺乏對英美作戰的膽量而吿退，東條卽在內府支持之下，於一九四一年十月出而組閣，一個兩而作戰的日本內閣。日軍偸襲珍珠港之夜，羅斯福總統曾有希望和平的電報到東京，東條堅信閃電戰三月可勝，他排除國內一切阻力，毅然對英美宣戰，作孤注之一擲。後來美軍反攻勝利，東條内閣辭職，但東條的威力未倒，依然支配陸軍和內府重臣的意志和行動。他終始是一個對英美戰爭的主導者。當日本投降簽字後第九日，麥克阿瑟元帥第一道拘捕令，便是逮捕東條，他曾畏罪自殺未死。這說明東條已覺察戰罪的重大，是無可逃避的事實。無疑的，他是希墨惡魔橫行的同謀，他並不比希墨「軟弱」。他向英美作戰，包藏獨親太平洋進入美國本土的禍心。東條和他的同僚，實應負戰罪的全部責任！</p>
<p>二·東條自辯日本受美英荷的「包圍」，致解決「中國事變」成爲不可能。律師淸瀨更辯護東條內閣的主要目的，在和平解決中國事件，並狂言三國公約之簽訂，乃在解決中國事件及避免日美戰爭。這又是一派說慣的　調。在田中隆吉的著述中，確切指出東條主張對華作戰到底，當漢口之戰時，德外長里賓特羅甫曾透過大川周明，意圖結束中日之戰，結果却被東條反對而止。近衛扶助汪精衛的偽組織聲言不以重慶爲交涉對手，東條就是近衛的同謀。近衛支持注偽組織，換取了東條及其陸軍的支持。一九四一年近衛意圖對美妥協，美國以日軍撤出中國爲條件，近衛軍在猶豫徘徊不定，　次與東條懇談，東條答稱「駐兵問題爲陸軍之生命，絕對不能讓步」（見近衛日記）。這都是東條拒絕和平的事實。東條組閣後，皇族東久邇宮矜彥，又曾向東條　議與中國蔣主席議和，但東條堅定的說：「絕對反對！現在我方的情勢很好，那些問題，再不要談了。」東久邇　藉蔣主席作媒介，來調停美日戰爭，東條更以堅定的態度說：「那樣的時　還沒有到，照這樣悄勢下去，會發展到怎樣樂觀的程度，也不知道。現在反正不是希望和平的時候」（見柬久邇日記）。可見東條對華侵略，始終主張以武力貫澈。絕無和平的意念。據田中隆吉的指訴，東條是强硬主張兩面作戰以爲解決「中國事變」的手段的人，永遠要夷中國人民作他的奴隷。事實是很明亮的，束條和淸瀨的狡辯，實在不確　駁。無疑的，他是侵略中國的主要兇犯，他指揮陸軍同僚殘骸中國人民，慘殺無辜。東條實應負載罪的全部責任！</p>
<p>他如侵略緬越，殘殺俘虜，酷刑並處死美國空軍官兵，都是東條一貫的蠻暴。這種種不可欺瞞的事口，今天怎樣能够粉飾過去？東條立於國際法庭之前，以「佛心」意圖脫罪，或希冀盟國减輕其犯罪行爲，眞是無恥！我　將這鐵的事實，向世界作簡要的陳述，是要推翻東條巧妙的供狀，和淸瀨虛偽的遁詞。我們要求眞理正義伸張；我們堅持「侵略戰爭是罪犯」的原則不變；我們有權利要求遠柬國際法庭將日本全部戰犯早日定　。我們有事實作忠實的證人，要求裁判束條英機，使他倒於眞理正義與法律之前，而絲毫不予寬恕！</p>

<h3>對反通貨膨脹法案　杜魯門嚴加批評　認係干涉總統職權幷不足抑止物價　因事實需要仍加以簽署</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿八日電〕杜魯門總統對於國會所通過之反通貨膨脹法，認爲完全不足以應付脫疆的物價，　表示將以極度失望之心情簽署此一方案。杜魯門指出國會所通過之反通貨膨脹法，僅包括　於十一月間向國會所提十點計劃中次要之三點，惟以該案所列措施仍爲目前所必需，故仍將于以簽署，惟渠覺該案並未包括主要措施，不能成爲有效的反通貨膨脹措施，不足以抑低物價，亦不能使物價不再上漲。杜魯門並指出通貨膨脹及生活費用之高昂，使美國人民面臨極嚴重之危險，通貨膨脹不予過止，足以引起經濟恐慌帶來不能形容的痛苦。杜魯門總指實國會通過之法案爲企圖干涉總統歷史性職權，其第六條規定總統應向國會提出關於　節稀少物品之極詳細而特定的建議，國會得就每一案件決定總統所提措施應否予以採納，以及該措施之細則，然後通過立法案准其施行。杜魯門復批評該案之拒絕，給予政府以强迫農工商業遵從政府命令之執行權力，指出與通貨膨脹之戰鬥決不能僅憑志願的行動。杜魯門　乃　請國會於一月初恢復例會時，採取有效而可資施行的反通貨膨脹計劃。同時並列舉自十一月十七日國會舉行特別會議以來之物價漲勢，指出當時華盛頓牛油每磅八角八分，上週已漲至一元零五分，匹次堡男子皮鞋每雙八元七角二分，今已漲達九元三角八分，芝加哥猪肉價，六星期來已自每一百磅二十四元七角五分，漲至二十六元四角。白宮新聞秘書羅斯宣布，杜魯門將於週一簽署國會通過之反通貨膨脹法案，其中包括輸出管制，釀酒，使用穀物之管制，及志頤估計工業之稀少物品等等。</p>
<h3>如何抑止高物價問題　將爲美大選政綱　民主共和兩黨開始互相指摘</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿九日電〕如何抑止高物價問題似將爲明年美國大選中各黨重要政權之一，爲此民主黨與共和黨之間互相之指摘乃更趨激烈。在杜魯門指斥共和黨之反通貨膨脹法案爲脆弱無力甚不適當之後，衆院共和黨領袖哈萊克與衆院銀行委員會主席華爾柯特即反　相　謂：總統前所主張之法案及其權力亦並不能使物價降落。華爾柯特更詞：「如不能使物價降落，則必爲總統而非國會之錯誤。」</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕杜魯門總統廿八日發表聲明之時，衆院共和黨領袖哈萊克，甚至又對總統發表渠應負高物價之攻擊，並力言民主黨在下年之普　中，將遭到一次重創。哈萊克稱：高物價之基本原因，第一，係行政當局金融政策之散漫，第二，輸出至外國貨物數量太巨。</p>

<h3>美國務院組專家委會　審查歐復興計劃　政府領袖擬使國會通過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿九日廣播：華盛頓訊，政府方面人士稱，苟援助歐洲復興計劃失敗或遭國會所拒絕，以致歐洲爲共黨所控制，則美國勢須每年付出二百億美元以增强國防。援助歐洲十六國復興之計劃，所需款項爲一百七十億元，代價並不甚大，雖其成效如何，目下尙難斷言。</p>
<p>政府方面領袖刻正就援歐計劃詳細硏究，以謀說服國會。苟國會將援歐數額削减，則歐洲之復興勢將爲之稽延。尤其是第一年之援助，最爲重要。美國之軍費預算，胥視蘇聯勢力是否將擴張之大西洋岸而定。設歐洲爲蘇聯所控制，則美國須將目前每年所付出之軍費一百十七億九千萬美元，增加一倍。</p>

<p>〔路透社雅典廿九日電〕此間宣布聯合國巴爾幹委員會之小組，定廿九日自廣朗尼加飛柯尼柴前綫，調査遊擊隊最近進攻該地之事。該小組當先飛往接近戰區之珍尼那城，然後再往接近阿爾巴尼亞邊界之柯尼柴。</p>

<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿八日電〕聯合國託管理事會主席賽雅爾廿八日提出四項計劃，以作美國對蘇政策之基礎。渠强調稱，美國旣不能「綏靖」蘇聯，亦不能「對蘇强硬」。渠出席美國政治科學協會演講稱：　必須實行切合公理·人道·正義之政策，否則美同將失去領導權。　美國必須不顧蘇聯之譴責，決定自身應循之道路。蘇聯之譴責，一部份由於恐慌，一部份由於根深蒂同之劣根性，又一部份由於廣泛之無知。　美國切勿作綏靖之舉，否則將釀成悲慘局面，和平之道端賴堅守公理。　但此亦非謂應對蘇强硬，美國必須儘可能爭取蘇聯人民之援助，吾人實無法認此事係屬不可能者。</p>
<p>又稱，飢餓與悲慘之歐洲，可變而爲「蘇維埃之歐洲」，但如實行馬歇爾復興歐洲計劃，使歐洲得以再生，則蘇聯將爲歐洲現　條件所迫而根本改變其外交政策。　氏最後稱，蘇聯言行雖　挑　成份，但目前並不準備與任何一等强國作戰，和平解決仍有一綫希望。</p>

<h3>陳立夫蔣經國聯袂由京抵滬　紀念週中致訓指導黨團合併　强調同志應密切合作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國民黨上海特別市黨部以下各級人事，一二日將有相當調整，以謀黨團合併後各項工作之順利推進。陳部長立夫與蔣指導員經國昨晟由京抵滬，會同指導此事之進行。陳氏接見記者時表示：黨團下層機構合併後，一切須納入正軌，黨員總登記須積極進行，因過去黨員有黨證，團員有團證，合倂後須另發新證，而將舊證取消。</p>
<p>檢討工作未能滿意</p>
<p>昨晟上海特別市黨部執行委員會曾於市體育館舉行擴大紀念週，歡迎陳。蔣座氏蒞臨致訓。除各級幹部外，潘議長公展，吳局長開先亦參加，吳市長則於儀式前趕到與兩氏晤談後，即先行辭出。方治主席，檢討年來之工作，認爲有幾點不能滿意：　黨員總登記本定本月份究成，南京方面已大致吿一段落，而本市迄在準備階段；　黨團合併以後，有若干區黨部工作尙未開展；　黨員未能積極協助政府戡亂，反呈消極之態度，實有未當。辭畢，即請陳部長立夫致訓。〔本報訊〕市衛生局局長張維，衛生局第三區衛生所蓬萊分所黃曾善，衛生局材料科劉異勳等三人，前被市民陸樹聲向地院民庭控吿，提出遷讓房屋之訴。緣中華路亦五八四號市房前後兩幢，係陸之產業，在上海淪陷期間，被僞衛生機關佔用，勝利後經衛生局接收，於該處設衛生分所，陸則向敵僞產業處理局提出產權證明，請求發還，經敵偽產業處理局調查後，確係陸之產業，准予發還，惟該分所因衛生器材甚多，一時無決遷讓，以致涉訟。昨經地院民庭推事何憲章宣判，被吿張維等敗訴，其後推房屋一幢，應於一個月內交還原吿，前進房屋一幢，應於一年六個月內交還原吿。後進房屋賠償原吿自三十四年十二月二十日起至遷讓日止每月租金法幣二十萬元。前進房屋在租用期間，自後進房屋遷讓之翌日起，按月給予原吿法幣十五萬元，原吿提供担保金法幣一千萬元，准予假執行，其餘之訴及假執行駁回，訴訟費用由被吿負担。</p>
<p>毌爲私利妨害合作</p>
<p>陳氏隨即檢討靑年團成立之結果及今日黨團合併之需要，語至坦率，略謂：二十年來，國民黨爲一革命之戰鬥體，其戰略戰術常隨時代環境而變易，終能打倒軍閥及官僚漢奸。當前大敵無疑爲共產黨，而廿年鬥爭之經騐，證明唯有共黨纔放得上爲國民黨之敵手。靑年團成立時之客觀環境，爲共黨能服從三民主義取消紅軍，故團之成立，對內爲統一黨內各小組織，對外爲團結黨外之靑年。當時本人曾一再主張靑年團應「爲訓練而組織，而非爲組織而組織」，今日客觀形勢改變，革命力量須再度集中，故有黨團合併之舉。其實團之產生及其合併，均爲革命之方略，同志今日絕不能爲私人利益而妨害其合作，否則即犯有錯誤云云。次由蔣經國致辭，強調黨團合併後，同志應密切合作，不能因成見而影響團結。紀念週至近午始吿結束。</p>

<h3>貴陽被服庫　大火內幕</h3>
<p>〔本報貴陽廿五日航訊〕貴陽南門外跑馬場聯動總部第二被服庫（屬重慶美贊管理處），第十八被服庫（屬雲南供應局），突於二十日晚八時起火焚燬，延燒至翌晨五時卅五分始吿撲滅，損失軍用物資據估計在一億萬元以上。經記者速日各方探詢，根據可靠報吿，內情複雜離奇，幕後新聞尙在逐漸發展中。據貴州供應局局長劉漢語記者：起火原因，係值勤庫兵用棉花澆汽油對着洋臘燭擦衣服，誤將臘燭碰倒入於未加蓋之汽油桶中引燃，故</p>
<p>無法撲滅</p>
<p>當時負責押運人員高少校適在城內遠東飯店未返，雖有隣近人民前往施救，看守兵丁恐有人趁火打刦，未奉命令，不便讓入，迨火勢由第二被服庫延至隣近之第十八被服庫時，人民恐火勢擴大，爭相踴進，守門衛兵遂開槍阻止，人民不得其門而入，俟第十八被服庫火勢擴力，該兩庫始於八點四十分報吿省書警察局消防總隊，到達火場時，已延燒逾時一個鐘頭。該兩庫</p>
<p>延不報警</p>
<p>有無別情，正爲各方所重視。貴州供應局長劉穎，當晚因應省黨部主任委員黃國楨宴請全體省參職員，前往作陪，於八點卅分宴畢返局，已聞火警，據劉氏語記者：該兩庫並非貴州局管轄，且亦不屬監督指揮，本可不聞不問，惟以旣同屬聯勤總部，且爲珍惜國家物資，遂緊急集合在局官熊熊，不可向邇，該局官兵奮不顧身，跳人火窟，猛力施救，火勢乃於深夜十二時撲滅，並</p>
<p>救出物資</p>
<p>大部，且當場將値勤庫兵二人，押運官長五員一體扣留，庫兵送警局訊問，官兵帶局偵訊。嗣至當晚二時許，火勢又吿復燃燃，連前彼燒房屋，共焚區去該兩庫房屋五座，損失物資，據劉局長口頭報吿與警局消防總隊對局方之書面報吿，頗有出入。經記者各方調査，此次被焚物資，總値實在一億萬元以上（消防隊之報吿）。第二被庫所焚物資，係自昆明經筑運往重慶，轉運長江下游者，第十八被詎庫所焚物資，係自重慶經筑，運往昆明者。</p>
<p>兩庫損失</p>
<p>之物資，計有打字機（劉局長語記者，此項物資繼値在六千億元，幸得大部救出，惟消防隊報告則云救出甚少，）打字紙，羅斯福呢，白羊毛襪，降落傘，棉被，膠鞋，毛巾等，就中以膠鞋，毛襪二種，損失最多。焚毀後之殘破鞋襪，積如土　。當由渝昆兩地運筑時，曾分裝爲四十大卡車，數量之大，即此可見。</p>
<p>貴州供應局方面刻已決心代該兩庫上級機關認眞澈查，特於廿三日派該局司法室姚軍法官至省曾警察局會同審訊，因刑事案件，最重視初供，此點不得不愼重將事。（特約記者劉湘綺）</p>

<p>學津「大學」篇名釋  不黨　　「大學」之「大」字，舊讀如「泰」，蓋本鄭康成注，指其地，對小學而言；朱子更定讀如本字，指其書，對小子之學而言。朱子之言曰：「大學之書，古之大學所以敎人之法也」；（大學章句序）又曰：「大學者，大人之學也」。（大學章句經注）所謂「古之大學」，所謂「大人之學」，蓋古學制之高級者，其年齒在童齡以上，其所學則由「灑掃應對進退之節，禮樂射御　敎之文」，進而爲「窮理正心修己治人之道」也。其學制所定之年齡如此，敎材又如此。顧其所敎乃洽人之道，則「大人」之與「小人」對，正猶「治人者」與「治於人者」對也。大人之學即治人之學，亦猶小人之學之爲治於人之學。洽於人者學失「　掃應對進退之節，禮樂射御書數之文」足矣；若夫治人者，則必更上而學其「窮理正心修己治人」之道，而學之之年，又非童龁以上不可也。　　由斯而言，大學乃吾儒言洽之書，惟其治本於人，（案儒家主人治）故又及於修身正心，而修正之途捨學問莫由，因復詳於格致之事；——此其書之所以由言治而及於爲人爲學，終復歸於言治也。　　綜夫爲治之方，在於行仁而已，故章句傳第三章曰：「爲人君止於仁」。仁者，仁民愛物之謂，蓋我與人物同是天地所生，形骸有別，性理無殊，然則自其小者而觀之，分人物彼己，自其大者而觀之，人物與我皆一體也。形骸有別，起於耳目之官之蔽塞；性理無殊，由於心思之官之感通。耳目之官爲小體，心思之官爲大體，故孟子日：「從其大體爲大人，從其小體爲小人」。（吿子上）推而廣之，我小體也，人與物犬體也；關於我之小體者爲小人，通彼己一人物者爲大人，故王陽明曰：「大人者，以天地萬物爲一體者也，其視天下猶一家，中國猶一人焉，若夫間形骸而分爾我者，小人矣。」（大學或問）　　總而言之，大人之學講治人之道，而治人之道，在於袪耳目之蔽塞，曠心思之感通，以明夫彼己人物之一體，然後推其所以修已者而治人理物，其功即孟子所謂「正已而物正者也」（盡心上）汽車工業六十年代  嚴仁賡　　去秋，美國汽車工業中心地特律城，紀念汽車發明五十週年，舉行盛大集會和遊行。是日，一八九六年至一九四六各型汽車，形形色色，數千輛全部出動，遊行全市，轟動全國。蔚爲地城空前盛况。　　從一八九六年第一輛汽車駛出街市日起，不出三十年，它便把美國人生活的各面完全改了觀。工業革命以來的重要發明，影響人生的廣泛與迅速，應以汽車居首。蒸汽機，電動力，和內燃機，是工業文明的三大功臣。然三者之間，汽車的發明對於人民生活影響之大，改變之速，却超過它前身火車和電器。今日，紀念汽車工業六十年代的開始，適原子能的研究亦已轉向於民生用途。這項新的硏究，又將發揮光彩燦爛的功續，改變人民生活的全部，並將超越汽車工業五十年間的成就，是可預卜的。在這個新時代的開始，我們重新估算過去五十年汽車工業對於人生的供獻，尤具特殊意議。這篇短文不容筆者作深　詳密的分析，僅先供給少數重要的事實，以引起研究近代經濟史，或研究美國近代工業發展史的人們的與趣。　　一八九六年，汽車工業尙在萌芽，參加這項工作的人，數不出幾個來，相關的工業還沒有感覺到這項幼秤工業的影響。此時以後，汽車的生產率年年增高，一九〇四年年產量已提高至二萬三千輛，一九一四年復增爲五十七萬三千輛，一九二四年增爲三百六十萬　，至一九二九年產額竟達五百四十萬輛之多。短短卅年，有比成績，簡直近乎奇蹟，登記的汽軍數目，一九二一年已一千零四十六萬爾，一九三二年增爲二千四百萬輛，一九四一年則爲三千四百餘萬輛，平均美國每四人便有汽車一輛。一九二九年經濟恐慌，汽車工業所受打擊不小，久未恢復舊觀。第二次世界大戰之來，却對它又加一番新的刺激和鼓勵。市塲需求股切，至今未衰。　　一九三九年，美國汽車工業僱用生產工人數，達七十餘萬，管進及推銷人員又一百二十萬人，此外，就業的商用汽車司機（包括公共汽車，卡車，出租汽車等）共三百八十萬人。所以這年美國，直接依靠汽車工業爲活的人歡，違五百七十萬人。供給汽車製造原料的各項工業，爲製造汽車原料所僱傭的工人又有六十萬人，修築公路供汽車行駛僱工人又二十餘萬人。因此，直接間接受僱於汽車工業的人數在一九三九年達六百五十萬人之衆（以上數字根據美國汽車製造業協會的報吿）。姑以每人養活三口計算，全美人民依汽車工業爲活的人數，在一九三九年當爲兩千萬人，佔美國全部人口六分之一弱。這是多末可驚的數字。　　汽車工業依賴若干工業供給大量原料。原料種類繁多，不勝枚舉，一部且倚賴於進口。在一假戰前的平時年（一九三九），美國全國消費的各種金　原料中，汽車一業佔生鐵全國消費量的百分之五十一，餘如鋼百分之十八，鋁百分之十，銅百分之十四，錫百分之十一，鉛百分之三十四，鋅百分之十二，　百分之二十三，錳礦石百分之十六。此外，全國棉花消費量的百分之十，木材的百分之五，玻璃片的百分之七十五，生橡膠的百分之八十，沙發用皮的百分之六十八，甘油的百分之十二，消用於汽車一業。一九三九年，全國鐵路載運貨物總噸數中，汽車一業也佔去其百分之十五。所以它又是鐵路的最大顧主之一。　　汽車工業在平時旣與其他工業關係密切，所以它的一舉一動，都可影響到全部工業甚至整個經濟的榮枯。一旦，戰事發生，汽車工業更能發揮它的偉大力量。這次美國對外戰爭，從珍珠港事變到停結軍事生產契約爲止的四年間，汽車工業爲政府製造軍器的價値達二百九十億元，計飛機及飛機機器一百十二億元，軍用車輛八十六億元，坦克車三十八億元，海軍器具二十億元，大砲機槍高射砲等十六億元，軍火，廻轉羅盤等十八億元。　　從美國的對外關係言，汽車工業也甚重要。汽車成品輸至外國的總値，一九四一年達三億四千三百萬美元的鉅額，將及全部生產總値的什一。國別中，加拿大，南菲，墨西哥，巴西，比利時，阿根廷等國，價値均超過一千萬元；丹麥，印度，荷蘭，菲律賓，委內瑞拉等國均超過五百萬元。這年輸至中國的汽車總值也達四，九六九，五五八元。（根據美國商務部世界貿易局五金機器組的數字）　　上面只舉出幾個數字，以示汽車工業對於美國人民經濟生活關係之密切。在美國工業界裏，它居於一個舉足輕重的地位。它不僅足以左右全國經濟的榮枯，五十年來它又把美國人民的生活方式和生產方式整個的改了觀。先說農業：汽車工業是它的一個大顧主。戰前的一個平時年，汽車工業可以消納三千五百萬元的農產品。同時，農業又是汽車工業的一個大顧主。仗着汽車工業供給曳引車和多種農具，大的農塲經營才可能實現。這不啻是農業上另一次的大革命。不僅農產品可以大量生產，農業生產成本且急劇下降。美國農業工人雖然工資特高，然美國的農業在世界上今日仍能握有壓倒的力量，完全拜農業機機化之賜。　　農業的生產力增加，經營面積加大，平均每畝需用的人工銳降，騰出大量人工，復有助於工業的發展。單位農家收入，增加不止倍蓰，農民生活已大爲改善。他們已可消用城市中的一切物質的和精神的享受，子女的敎育程度一般的提高，整個農村每個農家，經過五十年，一切情形已逈非昔比。且自公路交通便利之後，農民易於獲得廉價合用的種籽和農其，易於運銷產品，便於交換農業改良的知識和技術，也大有助於農業的改良和農民生活的改善。汽車深入農村，農村和都市的聯繫，日見緊密。　　今日，農家多數有自備汽車。根據一九四〇年美國普査局的調査，美國全國的大小轎車，每百輛有十五輛屬於農人。全數已連四百十五萬輛。平均每一農人每年駕駛汽車的哩程多至五千七百五十英里。農民並是卡車的最大顧主。一九四四年全年生產的卡車共一百零八萬輛，爲農民買去的，約佔其百分之三十五。　　汽車工業的發展對於城市所加的力量，雖不如農村，但影響亦大。因鐵路只能達到城郊，所以城市以內的交通和城區郊區的交通，往往依賴汽車維持。此外，日常在城內工作的人，因汽車往返方便，可以居住幽靜的郊外。工人住宅區也可移至市區以外，市內可有餘地增開公園圖書館博物館，舊屋和危險建築物又可以拆毁，都足以减輕人口對城市的壓迫，市內的火災和意外災害减少，衛生環境可大改善，都市的煩囂和都市一切的罪惡可大爲减少，人民的生活和健康大見增進。僅這幾項，對於都市人民生活的改變，已經不能說小了。　　汽車消費在美國已成爲任何人生活上所必需。工作的人仗着它去公事房，主婦仗着它計劃每日的家計，學童仗着它幫去學校。人的輸送，貨物的輸送，大部分是靠汽車。　期假日或每年的暑假，成千累萬的家庭，偕妻携兒，到數十百哩以外的郊野或風景區去遊覽休息，足以增進身心的健康，恢復工作的疲勞，其價值更是不能用數字計算的。　　汽車工業發展到今日的地步，它的地位不僅足以左右美國的經濟，並且間接可以影響世界的經濟。二十世紀最先的三十年，美國經濟發展一日千里，主要爲汽車電氣兩業所造成。但是到了三十年代的後半，汽車製造的技術已達盡美盡善之境地，技術改良的路十愈走愈狹，汽車業已是一項成熟工業（Matured　industry），汽車的消費逐漸達到飽和點，新陳代謝之外，市塲的推廣到了盡頭。最初消費遞增，工日製造業的規模無法維持。這支舉足　重的工業，一旦拉緩它的進度，影響之大是可以想像的。所以很多經濟學者承認汽車需要到了飽和點才造成一九二九年及以後的經濟崩潰和衰落，不爲無由。　　戰後兩年來，美國市塲上對汽車出品的需求尙無衰象，因爲戰時未滿足的需求尙待加緊塡補。惟未滿足的需求塡滿之後，這支已成熟的工業，形將無力再去支持美國經濟的繁榮。美國的經濟繁榮，或說世界的經濟繁榮，正等待另一項重要的發明來支持。値今汽車發明六十年代的開始，硏究五十年來汽車工業的一興一衰，應是洽經濟史者的一個極合時宜的研究題目。科學與方法  佐禹　　什麼是科學？依照現代英哲懷黑德敎授（Prof．A．N．Whitehead的界說，「科學是研究自然界或社會界的明顯事實，而求得軌範其間的聯絡的學問」。根據這一界說，科學不過兩種主要因素所構成：　是　確的事實，　是普遍的原理，所以說明或描述這事實的。科學不能無事實，同時又不能無原理。科學目的在搜求事實的原理，使事實能獲得一種確切，完全，槪括而有系統的說明或描述。我們可謂科學始於可見的現象，而終於不可見的原理。蓋科學原理本不是我們眼所能見的，我們所見的，乃是這些原理的例證。不過，事實是常人所能見，原理有時也是常人所能得。在未有科學以前，人類未始不觀察事實，也未始沒有事實的說明。如昔人謂地球爲平形。這是昔人觀察事實的說明。何以昔人的說明誤，而今日科學家的說明眞？昔人因何而誤，今人因何而眞？豈昔人的五官不及今人的敏銳歟？非也，曰方法不及今人耳。科學的進步，由於科學的方法，而科學之價値，亦在其方法。非有科學方法，不能有今日的科學。故我們可謂科學的要素或根本在方法。方法乃一切科學恒常而普遍的特徵。一位邏輯家史塔賓女士（Stebbing）說：「科學思維乃是受控制受指導的思維，根本上牠是方怯的」。方法的重要，於比可見。　　談到方法，實際上就是談到邏輯或理則學。所謂科學方法實際上就是邏輯方法。科學以邏輯爲其方法。科學運用邏輯以發現命題和證明命題。科學目的一方面在發現，一方面在證明，一方面在由雜多，混亂，不完全的材料以達乎一種廣包的全境，一方面則在由所得的全境或普遍原理以達乎特殊事實。是以一方面不能不運用歸納法（Induction），一方面亦不能不運用演繹法（Deduction）。歸納和演繹都是科學家所必用的。科學運用歸納以求得事物間的約束原理，運用演繹去證實或否定這原理。歸納雖是科學上最有用的方法，然不是唯一的方法，不能不輔以演繹。科學上系統化的企圖實即演繹化的企圖。科學題材的組織成為系統，便非運用演繹不可。所以這兩種方法是缺一不可的。　　科學的要素在方法，而方法即是邏輯，則提倡科學便不能不提倡邏輯，不能不注意邏輯。可是我國談提倡科學的人似乎便忽視了方法，忽視了邏輯。邏輯或理則學在大學理工學院公共必修的課程內是沒有的，即科學方法的課程也少見有。反而文學院中到有這一門必修科。這是作者所大惑不解的。研究文學的人不懂邏輯，關係尙小；硏究科學的八不懂邏輯，或沒有方法的自覺，關係之大，不言而喩。科學的進步和發明，全在其方法。不得其方法，或得之而不自覺，均不易使科學有長足的進展。作者誠心希望我國今日談提倡科學的人注意到這一點，不要把邏輯課程抛在理工學院之外。學林叢話　（四）  張其昀　　航空製圖　　自航空測量發明以後，地圖學界已起一大革命。按利用飛機攝影，推進情報業務，藉以校正地圖，並製成模型，以供作戰之響導者，實始於第一次大戰。一九三一年英人霍亭（MHotine）所著「航空攝影之測量工作」（Surveying　from　Air　Photography紐約出版）」書爲關於斯道第一部有系統之著作。一九三四年美國成立航空測量學會（American　Society　of　Photogrammetry），　員達七百餘人。美國利用飛機攝影所製成之地圖，佔全國土地三分之二。自第二次大戰發生後，航測技術進步尤速。例如用强烈之　光或投射照明彈，夜間亦可拍照。更因雷達之發明，飛敎可用無綫電之方法測定位置與距離，即在　霧迷　視綫不淸之時，仍可藉此種準確之儀器，拍攝地面形勢，測定轟炸目標。再以飛機所攝得之轟炸結果，作爲改進空軍器材之根據。盟軍幾次在歐洲登陸，關於海濱地形，海灘坡度，河流，森林，道路，橋樑，以及敵人防　工事之位置與型式，皆用航測所製之地圖與立體模型，以爲反攻之準備。盟軍注意搜尋敵人之煉油廠與儲油庫之所在，然後集中轟炸，於促成敵人之崩潰貢獻至大。　　航測除國防需要以外，對於學術硏究尤有永久性之價値。飛機攝影與普通地圖不同之點，在能將各稱自然現象及人爲建設，兼收並採，鉅細無遺。至於彩色照片，於區別地形地質及植物分佈等現象，尤爲淸楚明瞭。普通測繪工作，精力有限，往往顧此失彼，如欲包羅萬象，實爲勢所不許。飛機攝影所紀錄者，對於物境學（Ecology）之硏究，最感便利，物境學者所以硏究地形土壤與動植物之相互關係，亦即生物所受環境之影饗。此外如地理，地質，考古等學以及土地利用，士木工程，區域設計，都市設計之類，莫不有賴於此種新穎之資料。即於藝術家亦大有裨益。近年各國航測圖片，數量極多，有設立專門圖書館之可能，俾分類保存，擇要陳列，藉供各項學術硏究之參考。現在加拿大渥太華已經成立國立地形圖書館，收藏此類材料。　　航空測量之優點爲內容精詳，與時間與經費之節省。缺乏地形圖與地籍圖之國家，（Cadastral　maps）藉此可以迅速彌補此種缺憾。淸理地籍是地政的首要工作。民國十九年我國陸地測量局開辦航空測量隊曾測成五千分之一之首都地形圖。二十一年該隊受江西省政府之委託，測成南昌全縣一千分一之地籍圖，共計七千二百三十張，約合實際面積二百五十八萬畝，爲吾國整理土地之創舉，同時縮成一萬分一地圖一百十八幅，二萬分一地圖二十八幅。作者以爲我國在戰時養成的飛行人才為數不少，此時正可用空軍人才為國服務，一面借重先進國的技術設備和經險，傳授航空製圖之法，務期於最短期間完成全國詳細之地籍圖，以實平現均地權之理想。再縮成百萬分一以及他種比例尺的地圖，以供經濟建設種種設計之用。例如當年美國開辦TVA．制度，即以航空製圖爲其基礎。本年八月間上海市政府曾商得空軍同意，試測本市萬分一之地形圖，歷時一星期，全部經費爲五億元，有此開端，深望全國精密地圖能够迅速測繕，早日完成。　　設計之體與用　　設計（Planning）之眞正意義爲有計劃之行動，以達到預期之　的。如果僅有調査統計的紙上岡畫，那只能稱爲設計以前的準備工夫而已。一個設計自始至終包含五個步驟。　就建國的理想確定建設的目標與其實現的時期。　對於一定區域內的自然人文現象，根據確實資料作質量並重的分析。　具體規劃，即整個圖案的完成。　積極進行，包括地力人力物力財力等最有效之運用。　務使分區設計與全國設計有適宜的配合與聯繫，以達成建國的使命。　　凡設計有經有緯，縱的方面注重事業性的分工，積的方面注重地域性的綜合。前者須由經濟學家社會學家地質學家及各專科之工程師分別担任。後者則爲地理學家應盡之責任。地理學家之職務在於硏究土地人口資源之相互關係，其旨趣爲人文環境之改善，故有人境學家（Ecologist）之別號。地理學家所貢獻之區域觀念實爲設計最重要之工具。建國之道，端緖萬千，如何能內外相維，輕重相權，如何可由簡馭繁，條理井然，非有區域意識不爲功。設計乃地理學之應用，或稱曰應用地理學。地理學家所研求之理論亦因建國時期而多有實驗之機會。曠觀世界各國之經濟建設，其著有成續者，考其歷程莫不如是。</p>

<p>自由談閒話　白宮　主人  毛毅　　美國歷屆總統，除了華盛頓之外，都攜眷居住在白宮內。第一個喬遷進去的第二屆總統約翰亞當斯，在一八〇〇年。十七年之後，白宮才全部工竣，而如今白宮已成了華盛頓市的最老的官方建築物。　　死在白宮之內的總統一共祇有兩位：威廉·亨利·哈利遜和查卻利·戴勒。死在總統任中的計有七位：哈利遜，戴勒，林肯，加斐而德，麥金萊，哈定，和弗蘭克林。羅斯福。　　在白宮內結婚的總統僅有克利夫蘭一人，時在一八八六年六月四日。威爾遜總統雖然也是在任璧合時期內結婚的（續弦），但是，他的婚禮是在新娘的住宅內舉行的。　　總統卸任之後，國會就永久的正式贈送他一份每天出版的「國會紀錄」，並賜予使用國會圖畫館的特權。他一旦逝世之後，國會可能給他的遺妻每年五千元美金的撫卹金，不過，這並不是法律上規定的總統的權利，而祗是國會好意的贈與。　　有些總統卸任之後，並不願就此即休而隱居。例如，塔虎脫卸任後成了最高法院的大法官。柯立芝成了一家報紙的專欄選述者，約翰亞當斯和安敢露，約翰　遜則都圓歸到國會去任議員。　　說起國會議員，美國總統由議員出身的達十九人之多，這個數目還未將現任總統杜魯門計自在內。杜魯門以前雖是參議員，但是他被推選出來的職位僅是副總統，而不是現在所任的大總統。　　美國的總統幾乎是清一色的東部的產物。西部的密西西比河流域一共不過產生兩位總統，一個是祖籍伊奧華州的胡佛，另一個就是密蘇里州的杜魯門，東部的浮華尼亞州產生過八個總統，俄亥俄州產生過七個。　　美國的總統也是海陸軍（空軍分別鼎屬海陸兩軍）的總司令。不過，美國的傳統嚴格的認為總統是一個文官，所以他不也夠穿軍服。　　郵政部長是總統的內閣之中唯一有固定任期的首長，他的任期比總統的任期還長一個月，總統卸任或離職後，他的任期還有一個月，過了這個時期，新任總統才能加以撤換。其他的閣員的任期則不一定，都是隨總統之意旨而進退的。　　除了正式的內閣之外，有些總統還有私人內閣。傑克遜的私人內閣被算為他的『廚房內閣』，弗蘭克林。羅斯福的私人內閣就是出名的『智囊團』，杜魯門的私人內閣大槪因為常在『波多馬克』號遊艇上舉行的緣故，被稱為『遊艇俱樂部的孩子們』。　　要做白宮的主人，必須俱有下列的資格：　生下來就是美國的公民；　至少四十五歲；　在美國至少居住十四年。　　美國國會於一七八八年第一次所規定的總統就任日為三四月日，但是，華盛頓一直延至一七八九年四月卅日始行就任。第二十次的憲法修正案，將總統就任日改為正月二十日，始沿迄今。稱頌音樂家的話  南宮俟　　沃浩地·曼諾燕（Yuhudi　Menuhin）是現在世界上最享盛譽的青年小提琴家。十一歲時，他在柏林舉音樂會，演奏貝多芬，伯藍姆斯，和巴克的作品。那時，大科學家愛因斯坦也在座，音樂會後，他跑到後臺，高興的抱起曼諾燕，熱情的喊　：「你這孩子，又給證明了一次天上的有神的！」　　托斯卡尼卻稱贊曼謹燕：「啊，你唱得多美！」　　文槀蕭伯納於稱讚另一第一流小提琴家海菲斯（Heifetz）時，曾這樣對海氏說道：「世界上沒有十全十美的事，不然上帝也會妒忌的，所以可否請低飛於每天晚上睡前，彈錯一個音符？」。曆日  哥舒文　　　細想起來，日曆有什麼必要，古人說：「焉得中山千日酒，憬然直到太平時！」歲月如斯，也許越糊塗越好，雖然這話近於消極，然而在都市裏，日曆除了給放高利貸的計算拆息日子，給玩投機的朋友們標流割時間，給寫人一個咄咄逼人的預約，給拙當如我輩者以老大無成的悵惘，實在也想不出什麼好處，就是正在忙著戀愛的青年，每逢星期一望著那距離星期六的厚厚一疊紙頭，不也要皺皺眉嗎？　　不過那「使民復結繩而治之」的小國寡民之邦，畢竟不會再來的了，而且魯濱孫一個人在孤島上也還要刻了木頭記日期，大約寂寞是難廿的，「不知有漢，無論魏晉」，只是一種可愛的低能理想而已。眞的有這種人，你會看得中？記日期的方法各民族都發明的極早，巴比侖，埃及，中國可以說差不多，約略的講，只是因為農業生產一經成為人民的生活方式，便不能不關心月亮的圓缺，泥土的氣息，花草的榮枯，河水的漲落。經過若干時間的觀察與經騐，才有了七十二候的歌訣。這不是隨便妄作的。而附帶條件是，每一季節的變易，可能有理由的給他一個節日，也像上帝造萬物要休息似的，人類的工作，不能沒有一點慰安。節日所給人的，是疲勞之後的一杯蔡，或一支香煙。　　我極愛讀機惲的報孫會宗書，中則牢騷，像「田家作苦，歲時伏臘，　羊包羔，斗酒自勞，……酒酣耳熟，仰天拊缶，而歌鳴鳴。」眞是難得的好文章，因為他能寫出鄕村氣息，與坐在亭子間大呌到農村去者逈不相伴。我們出身農村的人，雖也鑽入「十里洋塲」，到底難忘那歲尾年頭的熱鬧氣象，騾車或牛車軋在沙沙的雪轍上，爺爺帶著孫子到集鎭去看年畫，也順便辦辦年貨。年景不壞，官家催租不兇，好白干多買幾斤，也別忘了孫女頭上的紙花和老太太的零碎兒。「千門萬門　　日」，溫肙不止在天象，也在人的心中。可是這就像三代以上的事了，只有在回憶中還清楚。黃巢時候，人肉論斤賣錢，李自成把銀子從貪官中逼出來，鑄造成更大的元寶，用騾馬馱向晉陜，「內庫燒成錦繡灰，天待躋盡公卿骨」，老百姓殆可知矣。太陽以下無新事，我們望著撕去了的日曆惆悵，也望著那剛剛掛上尙待一張張撕下的日曆杞憂。　　然而都市豈不正是鮮明的對比？看看講風土的畫就可以知道許多悲劇，屈原之犧牲換得都們大吃一通，臘月用八日本是秋收多跋的意思，說是彌勒佛生日，家家煮了雜穀的粥，就可以豐收，但明清以來，北京城富貴人家是煮成了百果粥加上青紅絲去送禮，老百姓的辛苦沒人分擔，其偶一事受卻被人紛紛要到都市來發洋財乎？　　「山中無曆日，寒盡不知年，」倒是好的，唯無處得此山耳。　　楹聯瑣話　　鄕先輩吳官人，遜清出事廿肅，清縣有凸透聲，其服官時所羣楹聯，　憂獨造，露然仁者之言，非第以才落勢也。當其由湘之平江還赴離右，下車伊始，即題衙署聯云：「自洞庭湖挂席西來，攜八百里波濤，洒作漢家新雨露；向望春　倚欄東額，趁廿四番風信，課耕隴上舊　　。」以洞庭八百波濤　為漢家雨露，試問是何等氣槪！課耕隴上雲烟，又是何種襟懷！　　此外，余尙慰問電其兩聯，其一云：「恩愛卅年心，怕囹圓含寃，屈他到底埋芳草；陽和三月景，願使訟庭無事，任我咱僮掃落花」。其胞子襟開闊，神志沖夷，一點仁心，躍然紙上，而了無頭由與道學氣，亦不落一般蹊徑也。其又一聯云：「官吏原非為傣錢，看古人餘簡鶴一琴，幾多秋水鳴清潔；亁坤從此銷兵氣，攜爺父老以隻雖斗酒，共上春臺醉太平」。「官吏原非為俸錢」，此與「千里做官只為財」者，相去為何如耶？「乾坤從此銷兵氣，尤為民父母者善頌善禱之詞矣。余以為此一聯語，直可用作民國三十工年之春聯，而榜之全國所有衙署中，用以厲清節，祈太平，為新年除舊布新之象，則較優之一般泛泛浮詞，寓意深遠，而響醒多多也。」「牲」  白蕪文　龍牛畫　　記得錢玄同先生說過，上海俚語的「豬頭三」一詞，由來已久，是有所本的，那是歇後語，底下藏著一個「牲」字；這其間，對於被諡者還有一點敦厚的同情，猶云不幸作了　鍾的犧「牲」！並不如今人以此語駡人，祗有快意，意味著「活該倒霉」的冷酷吧　　重慶亦有此相尖語，謂之「瘟豬子」，其意若曰：你這有病的豬，不吃也會病死的。　　「砲選」一詞已成名言，其實也是方言，到過四川的便知。原來一切槍——包括左輪勃郎寗，都呌砲。平常一個鄕長進城開會便帶上四名弁兵，佩槍簇擁而來——正如前幾年秦德純將軍告訴我在綿陽所見——使人想到直魯豫巡閱使張宗昌將軍之流的漢風餘韻。一有選鄕長之類的事，有槍的人少不得順手用槍，是頗為邏輯的。——想不到這回瀘縣殺幾個人來完成選舉，卻被判了死刑。　　在重慶，競選是不用槍或者砲的，然而卻有人用了二十億，結果是落選之後氣得如喪考妣。錢是怎麼用的呢？吃了二十天的「流水席」這也是重慶名詞，川流不息地開著海參席請客，許多保長保幹事甲長之類則每人領到五至十擔米價的活動費。　　然而，平常冬巖之類卻是楊子的信徒；拔一毛都痛流心髓，雖然「拔一根毛比窮人腰還壯呢」，有如劉姥姥所說。　　另一個巴縣附近的「紳糧」，則因賣田競選失敗，而又賠了如夫人的；姨太太小覷了他而要求仳離。用佛家的悲憫之巖來看，即便是「牲」，也該予以深厚的同情，雖然他這兩個犧牲的是錢而不是命。抽屜裏面  津津　　我想寫身邊文學的最現成題材，莫如打開一個人的抽屜。抽屜內的另物。擺得整齊與否，安放些什麼東西，不但可以顯未一個人性格，嗜好，也可以表示他在幹一些什麼只業的工作。　　以我自己寫字桌的抽屜而言，十分雜亂。我一面寫這篇文章，一面抽開來一看，裏　面有細長及粗矮的象牙煙咀各一枚，晚在一家象牙彫刻店內，乘廉價的當口買來的，可是我卻難昨取出來吸煙。　　再裏面是一疊殘稿，有小說，也有譯作，有完稿，也有只寫了一半的。我已經不記劉當初是誰約我寫的，又滬得是為什麼雜誌執筆的。這類雜誌現在卻已停刋了。我任意抽了一篇不完卷的小說，從頭讀了一遍，小說中的氣氛和情節，帶我回到過去的日子。那些人物，重又在眼前出現，可是目前我已經失去寫續稿的綫索了。　　我的抽屜中，自然少不了書，是我隨一已之所好，絡絡續續買來的。其中有文藝作品，報告文學，經濟學小品，　蔽業常識，科學新話，心理學分析等門類。我最愛讀的是臺蒙。倫揚的幾本小說集我著不多把市　上能夠買得到的，者要買來了。　　新近我又在冷攤上買到一本今年二月份出版的「紐約人」，就丟在抽屜內的一疊書上。打開這本雜誌的正文第一頁，在「記事及批評」欄下，第一則記道：「（紐約）第十四號街五角帽子商店，正在舉行大特價，出售六角九分的帽子。」這也許是美國物價上漲聲中的一種諷刺吧。得失之間  王百里　　趙匡胤陳橋兵變，黃袍加身，遂移後周之祚，其得帝位之易，無有逾此乾。殊不知後周郭威受後漢帝位亦然，五代史戰：「遼兵入寇，太后命帝出擊，至澶州，將士大噪曰：天子須侍中自為之。裂黃旗以被帝體，因擁南行，尋即大位。」此兩事如出一轍。諺語：「種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆。」其此之謂乎！逍遙花  陳慎言　　第六章　如此良宵（二九）　　渚齋端起碗來，匆匆吃完一碗，便放下箸，綺紈坐在旁邊，見他祗吃一碗，勸道：「你一火車下來，也該餓了，再吃一碗。」渚齋又端　碗，三口兩口，又吃光了。綺紈等他吃完，才笑道：「你和我還客氣，我不勸你，你就不吃。」渚濟指着　碗道：「我不是客氣，我急要知道，你這次出去，如何計劃，配角約的什麼人，到濟南露演，有什麼把握？」綺紈道：「我約的是李曼英，王長春，劉德松各人，角色還算齊全。至於戲碼，除了幾　梅派古裝戲，必需露演外，我偷告訴你，我也要紡棉花了，我想這一炮，一定打通。父親知道，一定不願意，但是我已露演，又在濟南，他也沒辦法！」說着，兩手掩着臉格格的笑，一頭伏在渚齋膝頭上。渚齋用手撫摸她的秀發，說：「你太大膽了，不怕你的老太爺生氣？」綺紈把臉一翻，兩眼望着渚齋說道：「我知道你也是不贊成我演這一類的以，可是不演這一類戲，只怕打不開。」渚齋正要駁他，小王媽輕輕推門進來，說道：「外面那位姓王的管事又來了。」綺紈立時起，雙手理一理頭髪，向渚齋點一點頭，便走出去，約莫二二十分鐘，雙手捧了一大捆鈔票進來，開起牀邊一隻小櫃，把鈔票放進一部份，留下一大半，放在桌上，拿一塊小包袱將牠包好，笑向渚齋問道：「你這次回來，家裏知道不知道？」渚齋道：「我還沒回家呢！」綺紈道：「家裏不知道，你暫緩回去，剛才濟南北洋戲院，派王管事送包銀來，我須送交父親花用，現在就去，請你多坐一會，我就回來。」一說後，又吩咐小王媽好招呼，拿了小包袱，匆匆走了。小王媽送綺紈出去，重復進來，笑問渚齋：「徐先生，你怎么許久不回來？老板那一天不念你，她向來對人就沒這樣關心。她背後儘說你好，什麼又誠實又穩重，又能幹，又熱心，無一不說，只可惜你……」小王媽說到這句，手掌握住嘴，格格的笑。渚齋道：「可惜我什麼？可惜我不長進，是不是？」小王媽把頭搖得博浪鼓似的，連說：「不，不！我不說，徐先生你以後可別和那位章小姐在一塊玩，老板常說章小姐是大學生，她是中學生，比不上她，徐先生，你想，這是什麼意思？」心跳  葛春良　　一個名紅一時的女伶年老退休時，住在一間新聞記者層樓上的公寓中，當一個老年的崇拜者去訪問她時，爬了六層樓的扶梯，爬得氣也幾乎

<h3>Chairman's Instructions on Military Strategy in Hankou; Summons Commanders of the Central China Region; National Army of Hubei Achieves Complete Recovery of Zhongxiang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 29th dispatch] When Chairman Chiang arrived in Hankou by plane from Nanjing at 4:45 PM on the 28th, Minister Bai Chongxi, Director Cheng Qian, Chairman Wan Yaohuang, and other military and political leaders went to the airport to greet him. After disembarking, the Chairman, accompanied by Director Cheng and Minister Bai, drove to the Wuhan headquarters for a brief rest and inquired in detail about the situation in Wuhan. On the morning of the 29th, the Chairman summoned military commanders of the Central China region, including Xia Wei, Zhang , and Mao Bingwen, and gave them instructions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 29th dispatch] Shashi and Yichang will be designated as pacification zones, and Pan Wenhua is internally designated to take the post of commander. Chairman Chiang summoned Mr. Pan on the afternoon of the 29th to give instructions on everything.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 29th dispatch] On the morning of the 28th, the National Army of Hubei, in coordination with local teams, captured Zhongxiang in one fell swoop. Approximately 2,000 remnants of Liu's 12th Column were driven out and routed, attempting to flee south. However, they were met head-on by the National Army's pre-positioned troops and suffered a heavy blow, scrambling back towards the northeast. The National Army is currently in pursuit.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 29th dispatch] Military news: The bandits of the 12th Column in Central Hubei and the bandit Zhang Jian's troops attempted to cross the River stealthily on wooden rafts near Zhihekou on the night of the 27th. They were severely attacked by the National Army and ultimately failed. The Air Force has launched large-scale attacks on the communists in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, from Xiping to Suiping, for several consecutive days, killing over 2,000 bandits and destroying many bandit military vehicles. The main force of Liu's 1st Column is still entrenched northwest of Xincai in southern Henan. Two battalions have fled to Huang'an and Macheng in eastern Hubei. A part of the 2nd Column has fled to Dahua坪, south of Huoshan. A part of the 3rd Column continues to move towards Zhongmei River. Additionally, remnants of the 6th Column, together with Yang Yu's bandit troops, fled south to the Huangmei and Guangji area. The National Army is intercepting them separately.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 29th dispatch] Chongqing headquarters news: Over 2,000 bandits under Luo Houfu, who have been causing disturbances in Qianjiang, Hubei, attacked Longhe City, intending to join forces with Zhang Jian's bandit troops from Zhongxiang to threaten Shashi. Employees of the Juxingcheng Bank in Shashi have evacuated to Chongqing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 29th dispatch] The communist bandits who fled to the vicinity of Jianli have been routed towards Mianyang by the National Army's reinforcements.

On the 28th, the National Army bravely intercepted them at Guodalou and Jishui集 (south of Luyi), killing and wounding over 1,200 bandits.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 29th dispatch] After the elite troops of the National Army entered Xin'an County, a portion of them moved westward and recovered Tiemen.</p>
<h3>National Army in Baoding Launches Attacks on Multiple Routes, Recovers Xuhe Bridge and Continues to Advance Northward; Communists Attacking Nankou on the PingSui Railway are Repelled</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 29th dispatch] Official intelligence: There is no change in the main force of Nie's bandits on both sides of Xushui. The National Army stationed in Baoding launched another attack last night. The troops advancing north along the railway recovered the stronghold of Xuhe Bridge at midnight and are advancing towards Caohetou this morning. The western route of the National Army captured Zhongnanjia and other places twelve miles northwest of Baoding this morning.

<h3>Ambassador Stuart Leighton Departs from Beiping to Return to Nanjing; Issues Letter to the Chinese People Before Departure, Hoping to Achieve Reform Through Democratic Means</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th dispatch] Ambassador Stuart Leighton is scheduled to fly to Nanjing by special plane on the morning of the 30th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 29th dispatch] Ambassador Stuart issued a "Letter to the Chinese People" at a conference of the Journalism Department of Yenching University here, stating that if China's progressive elements persist in striving for democratic reform, then American aid during this critical period can not only provide technical and material assistance but also inspire new hope.</p>
<p>To avoid external misinterpretation, Ambassador Stuart reiterated the outline of his speech, stating: "If there is a plan that can prevent all American aid from being wasted," then the United States would be very hopeful of approving it. The State Department is currently drafting this plan, preparing to submit it to Congress next month, but "it is still too early to express any more specific opinions."</p>
<p>The Ambassador stated: "I have pointed out that the Constitution of China is now in effect, but some people doubt whether it can be more effective than the Constitution on paper. I believe that this depends on the efforts of the Chinese people."</p>
<p>"Although most people are too busy with their daily lives to be interested in this, intellectuals, non-party members, liberals, and journalists should rise up to defend the rights and</p>
<p>A single government, on the one hand, cannot make the constitution work. Reform that is essential cannot be achieved solely by the government taking the initiative, but through freedom of speech, publication, and assembly, as well as the correct execution of elections, the people can achieve reform through democratic means, and many responsible officials in the government are also eager for effective reform."</p>
<p>"What the American government and people want is also what most Chinese people seek - unification, peace, economic recovery, and a truly democratic government. Under these circumstances, there can be American aid, and there is great sympathy for China among the American people."</p>
<h3>Special Envoy Ye Departs to Commemorate Burmese Independence Today</h3>

<h3>General Rooks Returns Home Early; Foreign Minister Wang Hosts Farewell Reception Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th dispatch] General Rooks, the head of the US Military Advisory Group, has been ordered to return home early to take up a new post. Foreign Minister Wang of our Foreign Ministry will host a farewell reception at his official residence at 6:00 PM on the 31st. It is reported that General Rooks will return to the United States without waiting for his successor, General Barr, to arrive in China, probably to confer with General Barr and key figures in Washington, including Marshall and Wedemeyer, to determine the scope and implementation plan of General Barr's future mission in China. General Rooks has cooperated closely with our side in China and has made great contributions. Official sources believe that General Rooks' return home will certainly contribute more to the continued cooperation between China and the United States in military technology.</p>
<h3>Soviet Strategy Towards China Forewarns of Change</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] Neutral political observers here stated on the 29th that the Moscow radio station's criticism of the Kuomintang and China's new constitution is the strongest attack made by the Moscow official agency on the Chinese government to date, reflecting a shift in the Soviet Union's strategy towards China. They pointed out that the newspapers controlled by the Soviet Union within China have maintained a neutral position on the civil war, which is very appropriate, but newspapers and radio stations within the Soviet Union have not hesitated to adopt the same position as the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<h3>Ji Xuetang is in Taiwan; Says Dalian is Becoming Increasingly Desolate</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaohsiung, 29th dispatch] Ji Xuetang, the mayor of Dalian, arrived in Kaohsiung from Tainan at 2:00 PM on the 28th. After visiting the Kaohsiung Commercial Port factory today, he took a car to Taipei. Mr. Gong told reporters that Dalian, two years after its restoration, has been unable to be taken over due to unexpected international influences, forming a special zone. The people are suffering from political and economic oppression and are fleeing abroad. Qingdao, Yantai, Shenyang, Jinan, and other places are full of refugees from Dalian. At the time of victory in the Anti-Japanese War, Dalian still had a population of over 1.3 million, but by the end of last year, it was only 1 million. According to recent news, it is now less than 600,000. The large-scale exodus of refugees has caused Dalian to become desolate and decline. While in exile, they all hope that the government will seriously negotiate and actively proceed with the takeover, so that the exiles can return to their hometowns and those in their hometowns can be relieved of their hardships.</p>
<h3>New Post of Xiong Shihui Announced; Appointed Member of the Strategic Advisory Committee; Luo Zhuoying and Feng Qinzai Appointed Deputy Directors of Two Headquarters</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] Order of the National Government on December 30th: Xiong Shihui is specially appointed as a member of the Strategic Advisory Committee. Luo Zhuoying is appointed as the Deputy Director of the Northeast Headquarters of the Chairman of the National Government. Feng Qinzai is appointed as the Deputy Director of the North China Headquarters of the Chairman of the National Government. Tao Fengshan is appointed as the Chinese Director of the Administrative Council of the International Telecommunication Union.</p>
<h3>Chief of Staff of the North China Headquarters Talks to Foreign Reporters; Soviets Assist Communist Rebellion in the Northeast; National Army Will Eventually Defeat the Communists</h3>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 28th dispatch] Xu Qiming, Chief of Staff of the North China Headquarters, stated to United Press reporters on the 28th that the Soviet Union is supplying the communist bandits in the Northeast with advisors, light weapons, and communications equipment. If the Soviet Union can control China through the Communist Party, then Vietnam and Burma, and in fact the entire East Asia, will be lost. The United States will only have one ally, Japan, in the Far East. CCP leader Zhou Enlai is prepared to go to Moscow to discuss barter trade between the Northeast and the Soviet Union. Although the commanders of the National Army welcome foreign aid, they also know that it is not reliable, but they will eventually be able to defeat the communist bandits. The situation in the Northeast is very tense. The great battle of Shenyang is expected to begin within a week in Xinmin. However, it is believed that Shenyang can be defended, as the National Army has sufficient forces there. Only the forces on the section of the BeiNing Railway outside the customs are relatively weak, so Suizhong has been reinforced. The communist bandits believe that with Soviet assistance, they can conquer China, but they must obtain the support of the Chinese people. However, the Chinese people all resent the communist bandits. Although they are forced to obey in the communist areas, they will side with the National Army as soon as they have the opportunity. Mr. Xu does not believe that the communist bandits will attack Tianjin and Beiping, because the National Army has sufficient forces to defend them, which the communist bandits know. Therefore, their target may be Baoding and the destruction of the PingSui Railway.</p>
<h3>Reward Talent and Improve Administrative Efficiency; Year-End Performance Evaluation Must Be Serious; Chairman's Handwritten Instruction Transferred to All Agencies by the Executive Yuan for Compliance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] Chairman Chiang recently issued a handwritten instruction to the Executive Yuan, ordering it to transfer it to all agencies. At the end of the year, the practice of rewarding outstanding personnel should be carried out seriously, and strict assessments should be made to emphasize the dignity of the government. The text of the instruction is as follows: "It is found that the year-end performance evaluations of various agencies, especially the selection of the most outstanding personnel, are intended to encourage the officials and commend special achievements. However, since the implementation in previous years, many have engaged in it seriously, but it is inevitable that some have merely gone through the motions. It is deeply felt that there are cases of favoritism and indiscriminate selection, or rotating to fill the numbers, or work achievements are not listed with concrete facts, or the submission of forms is not done within the prescribed time limit. How can we achieve fairness and obtain practical results? A special telegram is sent for reference, and it is hoped that it will be transferred to the subordinate ministries, commissions, departments, bureaus, and the responsible officials of the provincial and municipal governments, so that they must handle it seriously and strictly assess it in the future. All statements must be verified and in accordance with the facts, and meet the people's expectations, in order to meet the purpose of rewarding talent and improving administrative efficiency. A special order is given for compliance." It is learned that the Executive Yuan has ordered all responsible agencies throughout the country to comply.</p>

<p>[Another dispatch] Over 500 scattered bandits in the southwest area of Shenyang took advantage of the moonlight on the night of the 27th to launch a surprise attack on Yuhongtun, southwest of Shenyang City. The garrison retaliated, and the two sides engaged in fierce fighting for five hours. By around 2:00 AM on the 28th, the bandits left over a hundred corpses and retreated, fleeing north across the BeiNing Railway, attempting to meet up with the bandits in the northwest area of Shenyang and harass the suburbs again.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] The Fourth Division of the Eighth Column of bandits in southern Liaoning has been wandering around Tanggangzi and Datun for several consecutive days.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Accusation Against Hideki Tojo</h3>
<p>The individual trials conducted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, which began on August 4th of this year, have now entered their final and most important phase. Former Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo appeared in court on the 20th of this month for trial. On the 22nd, Prosecutor Bligh announced the 245-page statement of charges, and on the 26th, the war criminal Tojo presented a 60,000-word defense. The defendant's lawyer, Dr. Ichiro Kiyose, delivered eloquent arguments, striving to exonerate Tojo, and in recent days, a small number of Japanese newspapers have even rallied to his support. The trial of Tojo is the central trial for all war criminals; the establishment of Tojo's war crimes is the establishment of the crimes of all war criminals. Now, the whole world is focused on Tojo's trial. China suffered the most tragic and profound invasion by Japanese militarists. Tojo's poisoning and persecution of China are unforgettable to our 400 million people. Today, as Tojo stands trial in an international court, and as Tojo and Kiyose unleash their eloquence, we should, based on facts and truth, straightforwardly and solemnly accuse them. Moreover, we want world public opinion to unanimously condemn them, condemning them for the sake of truth and justice, overwhelming Tojo before the sacred law!</p>
<p>We Chinese advocate not dwelling on past grievances and not going too far. However, on the issue of the Japanese invasion of China, we can forgive innocent Japanese civilians, but we insist that war criminals, especially the chief culprits like Tojo, must never be forgiven. Hideki Tojo was the chief instigator of the Japanese militarists. Japanese soldiers and high-ranking officials revered him as the "Sei-i Taishogun" (Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians). He served as the Minister of the Army in the Konoe Cabinet twice, and in October 1941, he forced Konoe out and appointed himself Prime Minister. He was the mainstay of the Japanese wartime cabinet, and his iron fist could command the army and air force. Japan's continuous invasion of China was initiated by him. Japan's invasion of Burma and Vietnam, the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the launch of the so-called "Greater East Asia War" were also masterminded by him. Shattering Japan's party politics, implementing military interference in politics, and establishing a fascist regime were his masterpieces. Adopting Axis hopefulness and joining the Tripartite Pact with Yosuke Matsuoka and others, declaring war on Britain and the United States, were all led by him. Tojo's crimes are well-documented, cunning, and notorious worldwide. The writings of Japanese people after the defeat exposed the crimes of the rampaging militarists, and they all unanimously blamed Tojo, knowing it without the prosecutor's accusations. Tojo is the number one Class A war criminal. His sins are unprecedented, his accumulated power and wickedness have spread far and wide. His crimes are a concentration of the crimes of the Japanese militarists. Today, even if he has a 60,000-word defense and Kiyose Ichiro's eloquence, the facts are undeniable, and they cannot absolve him of the slightest bit of his crimes. People all over the world are his plaintiffs and witnesses to his crimes!</p>
<p>Tojo has been in custody for more than a year, embracing Buddhism in an attempt to prolong his life and shift the world's hatred of him. However, his rationality has long been extinguished. Today, although he uses a false Buddhist heart to publish crazy theories and unleash his eloquence, intending to escape punishment, we believe that the judges of the International Court have conscience and reason and will certainly not be deceived by him, confusing their own judgment. We hereby vehemently denounce Tojo and Kiyose's evasions, to uphold justice.</p>
<p>1. Tojo stood before the International Military Tribunal and admitted that he was fully responsible for the Pacific War and Japan's defeat but denied committing any crimes. He defended the attack on Pearl Harbor by arguing that Japan had prior knowledge of the United States' plan to wage war against Japan, so Japan's war was out of self-defense. This is nonsense. We can point out from the "Konoe Diary," Tanaka Ryukichi's "The True Story of the Japanese Militarists Ruining the Country," and Mori Masazou's "Twenty Years of Whirlwind" that the Pacific War was the result of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, a pre-determined plan by Tojo and Matsuoka. As for the negotiations between Nomura and President Roosevelt, and Konoe's dealings with Ambassador Grew, they were merely attempts to ease the tense situation between Japan and the United States; but they ultimately failed due to Tojo's obstruction. Tojo and Matsuoka advocated making a desperate gamble to fulfill their promise to Hitler. He said to Konoe: "Sometimes in life, you might as well close your eyes and take a risk!" However, Konoe ultimately resigned due to a lack of courage to fight against Britain and the United States. Tojo, with the support of the inner circle, formed a cabinet in October 1941, a Japanese cabinet that fought on two fronts. On the night of the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt sent a telegram to Tokyo hoping for peace. Tojo firmly believed that the blitzkrieg could win in three months. He eliminated all resistance within the country and resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, making a desperate gamble. Later, the American military counterattacked and won, and the Tojo cabinet resigned, but Tojo's power did not fall. He still controlled the will and actions of the army and the inner circle of high-ranking officials. He was ultimately a leader of the war against Britain and the United States. On the ninth day after Japan surrendered and signed the surrender document, Marshal MacArthur's first arrest warrant was to arrest Tojo. He had attempted suicide out of fear of guilt but failed. This shows that Tojo had realized the magnitude of his war crimes, a fact that could not be escaped. Undoubtedly, he was an accomplice to the rampant evil of Hitler, no "weaker" than Hitler. He waged war against Britain and the United States, harboring the sinister intention of dominating the Pacific and entering the American mainland. Tojo and his colleagues should bear full responsibility for the war crimes!</p>
<p>2. Tojo defended himself by saying that Japan was "encircled" by the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands, making it impossible to resolve the "China Incident." Lawyer Kiyose even defended that the main purpose of the Tojo cabinet was to peacefully resolve the China Incident and wildly claimed that the signing of the Tripartite Pact was to resolve the China Incident and avoid a Japanese-American war. This is another set of familiar lies. In Tanaka Ryukichi's writings, it is clearly pointed out that Tojo advocated fighting China to the end. During the Battle of Hankou, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, through Shumei Okawa, attempted to end the Sino-Japanese War, but it was rejected by Tojo. Konoe's support for Wang Jingwei's puppet regime stated that Chongqing was not a negotiating partner, and Tojo was Konoe's accomplice. Konoe supported the puppet regime in exchange for Tojo and his army's support. In 1941, Konoe intended to compromise with the United States. The United States set the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China as a condition. Konoe hesitated and repeatedly had earnest talks with Tojo. Tojo replied, "The issue of stationing troops is the life of the army and cannot be conceded absolutely" (see Konoe Diary). These are all facts of Tojo refusing peace. After Tojo formed the cabinet, Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko also suggested to Tojo to negotiate peace with Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek, but Tojo firmly said, "Absolutely opposed! Our situation is very good now, let's not talk about those issues anymore." Higashikuni wanted to use President Chiang as a medium to mediate the American-Japanese war, but Tojo said with an even firmer attitude: "That time has not yet arrived. We don't know how optimistic the situation will develop if we continue like this. Anyway, now is not the time to hope for peace" (see Higashikuni Diary). It can be seen that Tojo consistently advocated using force to carry out the invasion of China and had no intention of peace. According to Tanaka Ryukichi's accusation, Tojo was a person who strongly advocated fighting on two fronts as a means to resolve the "China Incident," and he always wanted to enslave the Chinese people. The facts are very clear. Tojo and Kiyose's sophistry is simply irrefutable. Undoubtedly, he is the main culprit in the invasion of China. He commanded his army colleagues to massacre the Chinese people and cruelly kill the innocent. Tojo should bear full responsibility for the war crimes!</p>
<p>Other acts, such as the invasion of Burma and Vietnam, the killing of prisoners of war, and the torture and execution of American Air Force officers, were all consistent with Tojo's barbarity. How can these undeniable facts be whitewashed today? Tojo stood before the International Military Tribunal, using a "Buddhist heart" in an attempt to escape punishment or hoping that the Allied countries would reduce his criminal behavior. It is truly shameless! We will make a brief statement of these ironclad facts to the world to overthrow Tojo's clever statements and Kiyose's false evasions. We demand that truth and justice be upheld; we insist that the principle that "aggressive war is a crime" remains unchanged; we have the right to demand that the International Military Tribunal for the Far East sentence all Japanese war criminals as soon as possible. We have the facts as honest witnesses, demanding the trial of Hideki Tojo, so that he falls before truth, justice, and the law, and is not spared in the slightest!</p>

<h3>Special Envoy Ye Will Fly to Burma</h3>
<p>[Continued from page one] Strengthening Sino-Burmese Relations</p>

<h3>Strike Wave at Central University; Students and School Officials Have Not Yet Reached an Agreement to Resume Classes</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper in Nanjing on the 29th] Since a partial strike began on the 25th by Central University students in protest of the expulsion of eight students, the number of striking departments and grades has reached 109 as of the 29th. At 11:00 p.m. on the 28th, the school officials appointed eight professors to hold negotiations with representatives from the department and grade associations, resulting in four resolutions: 1.

<h3>Students from Eight Universities in Peiping and Tientsin Oppose the Student Union Regulations</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper in Peiping on the 29th] Student unions from eight universities in Peiping and Tientsin (Tsinghua, Yenching, Peking University, Sino-French University, Teachers College, Nankai, Peiyang, and Hebei Institute of Technology) jointly issued a statement yesterday opposing the student union regulations announced by the Ministry of Education on the 14th, requesting that the order be rescinded.</p>
<h3>Explanation of the Key Points of the Education Authorities' Amendment to the Student Union Regulations</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper in Nanjing on the 29th] This newspaper's reporter inquired with the education authorities about their opinion on the student union regulations announced by the Ministry of Education. According to the discussion: In order to enable student unions to fully develop an atmosphere of academic research and foster the spirit of student autonomy, and in view of the fact that some clauses in the student union regulations announced in November of the 32nd year (1943) were not in line with the current situation, the Ministry of Education decided to make important amendments after several months of detailed study: First, to delete the original Article 7, "Whether they are members of the Chinese Kuomintang or members of the Three People's Principles Youth League"; Second, to abolish the indirect election system and adopt a direct election system; Third, to relax the number of directors, and stipulate them separately according to the proportion of the number of students in each school, up to a maximum of 45, so that students' opinions can be expressed more widely; Fourth, to comply with the ideal of selecting the virtuous and capable, stipulating that directors should be elected from those who have excellent conduct and academic performance and who have leadership abilities. Although the wording of the other clauses has been slightly modified, they are mostly the original regulations. In summary, the key points of this amendment are based on the following principles: 1. To comply with the implementation of the Constitution and abolish the regulations concerning party members and league members; 2. To train the spirit of student autonomy and adopt direct elections so that student opinions can be expressed more widely, making it more democratic; 3. To encourage academic research and allow students with excellent academic performance to serve as directors of the student union as a model. Students should focus on academic research and enriching their intelligence during their time at school; students at school should not be used by others as tools for political struggle. In the past, the organization of student unions in a small number of schools did not fully comply with the regulations, and their actions were often excessive, even interfering with school administration and neglecting their studies, and they were controlled by a small number of individuals with ulterior motives, serving as tools for political struggle. In order to achieve the true purpose of student unions in the future, it is necessary to thoroughly implement the amended regulations.</p>
<h3>Boy Scout Martyred in Anti-Banditry in Shimen; Boy Scout Association Decides to Grant Preferential Treatment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Boy Scout Association learned that the Shimen City Branch of the Boy Scouts of China in Hebei Province mobilized more than 1,000 boys and girls from the city on the 4th of last month during the Battle of Shimen to organize a battlefield service team led by Yang Guoying. They took on the work of battlefield stretcher-bearers, rescue, nursing, and transportation, and assisted the National Army in constructing fortifications, checking household registrations, and preventing the movement of spies. Unfortunately, due to the large number of bandits compared to our forces, after nine days and nights of fighting, the National Army finally withdrew, resulting in heavy casualties among the military and civilians. The scout group suffered 13 casualties, including Yan Fahe and Du Ping. Eight people, including Xu Duo, were injured and are being treated in hospitals. Shan Zizhen was captured and his whereabouts are unknown. The scouts who died, were injured, or captured were all students at various middle schools in the city. Their loyalty, service, and spirit of sacrifice are admirable. The Party and the Military Association have decided to grant preferential treatment and relief.</p>

<h3>Hai River Freezes Again; Strike of Tientsin Ships Under Mediation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tientsin, 29th] The Hai River ice freeze is getting worse again. After the initial melting of the heavy snow, the northwest wind is strong.

Four ships remaining in Tientsin, Huangxing and Nansheng, etc., are scheduled to try to sail out on the 30th. If they can break through the ice, they can sail to Shanghai. Otherwise, the Tientsin-Gugu shipping problem will reach the most stable stage.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tientsin, 29th] The strike of employees of various transport ships in Tientsin has reached its third day on the 29th. The reason is that a small boat carrying some soldiers was overturned by a ship of the China Merchants Bureau, and several people fell into the water. The soldiers then fired at the ship, so the sailors and drivers went on strike to protest. A total of eleven ships are on strike. The striking sailors are demanding that the soldiers involved be punished. The striking sailors claim that the ship had sounded its whistle as a warning, but the small boat stubbornly ignored it and refused to move aside, leading to the accident. After the soldiers opened fire, they confined the captain and officers to the barracks, stripped them of their clothes, and poured cold water on them. The striking sailors are demanding compensation for the injured employees and guarantees that the same incident will not happen again in the future. The Mayor of Tientsin is currently mediating.</p>

<h3>Truman Severely Criticizes Anti-Inflation Bill; Believes It Interferes with Presidential Authority and is Insufficient to Curb Prices; Signs It Nevertheless Due to Factual Need</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 28th] President Truman believes that the anti-inflation bill passed by Congress is completely inadequate to cope with runaway prices and has indicated that he will sign the bill with extreme disappointment. Truman pointed out that the anti-inflation bill passed by Congress only includes three minor points of the ten-point plan submitted to Congress in November. However, as the measures listed in the bill are still necessary at present, he will still sign it. However, he feels that the bill does not include key measures, cannot become an effective anti-inflation measure, and is insufficient to curb prices or prevent prices from rising further. Truman also pointed out that inflation and the high cost of living pose a very serious danger to the American people. If inflation is not stopped, it could cause an economic panic and bring indescribable suffering. Truman also pointed out that the bill passed by Congress attempts to interfere with the President's historical authority. Article 6 stipulates that the President should submit to Congress extremely detailed and specific recommendations on the allocation of scarce items, and Congress may decide on a case-by-case basis whether to adopt the measures proposed by the President and the details of the measures, and then pass legislation to allow their implementation. Truman further criticized the bill's rejection of giving the government the power to compel agriculture, industry, and commerce to comply with government orders, pointing out that the fight against inflation can never rely solely on voluntary action. Truman then urged Congress to take effective and implementable anti-inflation plans when it resumes its regular session in early January. At the same time, he listed the price increases since the special session of Congress on November 17, pointing out that Washington butter was 88 cents per pound at that time, and has risen to $1.05 last week. Men's leather shoes in Pittsburgh were $8.72 per pair, and have now risen to $9.38. The price of pork in Chicago has risen from $24.75 per hundred pounds to $26.40 in six weeks. White House Press Secretary Ross announced that Truman will sign the anti-inflation bill passed by Congress on Monday, which includes export controls, brewing, control of grain use, and scarce items for industrial estimation, etc.</p>
<h3>How to Curb High Prices Will Be a Major Platform in the US Elections; Democrats and Republicans Begin Blaming Each Other</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] How to curb high prices seems to be one of the important political platforms of various parties in the upcoming US elections next year. For this reason, the mutual accusations between the Democratic and Republican parties are becoming more intense. After Truman accused the Republican anti-inflation bill of being weak, powerless, and very inappropriate, House Republican Leader Halleck and House Banking Committee Chairman Wolcott retorted: The bill advocated by the President and his powers also cannot bring down prices. Wolcott added: "If prices cannot be brought down, then it must be the fault of the President, not Congress."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] When President Truman issued a statement on the 28th, House Republican Leader Halleck even attacked the President for being responsible for high prices, and strongly stated that the Democratic Party would suffer a severe blow in next year's general election. Halleck claimed: The fundamental reasons for high prices are, first, the loose financial policy of the administration, and second, the excessively large quantity of goods exported to foreign countries.</p>
<h3>Republicans to Discuss Further Plans</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Senate Republican Policy Committee Chairman Taft announced today that the committee will discuss further plans to prevent inflation and other issues, such as tax cuts, extension of rent control, reduction of government spending, and restriction of bank loans, when it meets at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg-Taft Coordination Not Impossible; US Republicans Strive for Cooperation Between the Two</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 29th] According to various indications, Senate Republicans will do everything possible to reverse the opposition between the two Republican leaders (Vandenberg and Taft) on the European Recovery Program in the election year. Political observers say: This division, even if the Republican Party disagrees on a major issue, will make it difficult for the Republican Party to draft an outline of foreign policy at the national convention next summer. The Republican Party believes that there is no insurmountable gap between Vandenberg and Taft's views, because there is reason to believe that both of them are seeking mutual coordination on the issue of foreign aid.

<h3>US State Department Forms Expert Committee to Review European Recovery Plan; Government Leaders Plan to Get Congress to Pass It</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York Radio, 29th: Washington News, government officials say that if aid to the European Recovery Program fails or is rejected by Congress, resulting in Europe being controlled by the Communist Party, the United States will have to spend $20 billion annually to strengthen its national defense. The plan to aid the recovery of 16 European countries requires $17 billion, which is not a large price, although it is difficult to say how effective it will be at this time.</p>
<p>Government leaders are currently studying the aid to Europe plan in detail in order to persuade Congress. If Congress reduces the amount of aid to Europe, the recovery of Europe will be delayed. In particular, the first year of aid is the most important. The US military budget depends on whether Soviet power will expand to the Atlantic coast. If Europe is controlled by the Soviet Union, the United States will have to double its current annual military expenditure of $11.79 billion.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 29th] Officials at the State Department responsible for guiding and reviewing Europe's recovery needs have formed a so-called "Technical Experts Committee for the European Recovery Program."

<h3>US Policy Toward the Soviet Union; Appeasement is Not the Best Policy, But Neither is Hardline; Sayre Expresses His Views</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 28th] UN Trusteeship Council Chairman Sayre presented four plans on the 28th as the basis for US policy toward the Soviet Union. He emphasized that the United States can neither "appease" the Soviet Union nor be "hardline toward the Soviet Union." He said in a speech to the American Political Science Association: 1. We must implement policies that conform to public reason, humanity, and justice, otherwise the United States will lose its leadership. 2. The United States must decide its own path regardless of the Soviet Union's condemnation. The Soviet Union's condemnation is partly due to panic, partly due to deeply rooted inferiority, and partly due to widespread ignorance. 3. The United States must not appease, otherwise it will lead to a tragic situation. The path to peace depends on adhering to public reason. 4. But this does not mean that we should be hardline toward the Soviet Union. The United States must try its best to win the assistance of the Soviet people. We really cannot recognize that this is impossible.</p>
<p>He also said that a hungry and miserable Europe could become a "Soviet Europe," but if the Marshall Plan for the recovery of Europe is implemented to allow Europe to regenerate, the Soviet Union will be forced by the current conditions in Europe to fundamentally change its foreign policy. Mr. Sayre finally said that although the Soviet Union's words and deeds are provocative, it is not currently prepared to fight any major power, and there is still a glimmer of hope for a peaceful solution.</p>

<h3>Chen Lifu and Chiang Ching-kuo Arrive in Shanghai Together from Nanjing; Instruct on Party-Youth League Merger During Memorial Week; Emphasize Close Cooperation Among Comrades</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The personnel of the Shanghai Special City Party Department of the Kuomintang and all its subordinate levels will have considerable adjustments on the 12th to promote the smooth progress of various tasks after the Party-Youth League merger. Minister Chen Lifu and Instructor Chiang Ching-kuo arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday to jointly guide the progress of this matter. When Mr. Chen met with reporters, he said: After the merger of the lower-level organizations of the Party and the Youth League, everything must be brought into order. The general registration of party members must be actively carried out, because in the past, party members had party membership cards and Youth League members had Youth League membership cards. After the merger, new cards must be issued separately and the old cards must be cancelled.</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory Review of Work</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Department held an enlarged memorial week at the Municipal Gymnasium to welcome the arrival of Mr. Chen and Mr. Chiang for instruction. In addition to cadres at all levels, Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Director Wu Kaixian also participated. Mayor Wu arrived before the ceremony to meet with the two gentlemen and then left first. Chairman Fang Zhi reviewed the work of the past year and believed that there were several unsatisfactory points: The general registration of party members was originally scheduled to be completed this month, and Nanjing has basically come to an end, but this city is still in the preparatory stage; After the merger of the Party and the Youth League, the work of some district party departments has not yet been launched; Party members have failed to actively assist the government in suppressing the rebellion, but have shown a negative attitude, which is really inappropriate. After the resignation, Minister Chen Lifu was invited to give instructions. [Report from this Newspaper] Zhang Wei, director of the Municipal Health Bureau, Huang Zengshan, director of the Penglai Branch of the Third District Health Center of the Health Bureau, and Liu Yixun of the Materials Section of the Health Bureau were previously sued by Lu Shusheng, a citizen, in the Civil Court of the District Court, filing a lawsuit to vacate the house. The reason is that the front and rear buildings of the municipal house at 584 Zhonghua Road are Lu's property. During the fall of Shanghai, it was occupied by a puppet health agency. After the victory, it was taken over by the Health Bureau, and a health branch was set up there. Lu then submitted a property certificate to the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, requesting its return. After investigation by the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, it was confirmed that it was Lu's property and was approved for return. However, due to the large number of health equipment in the branch, it was impossible to vacate it for a while, resulting in a lawsuit. Yesterday, He Xianzhang, a judge of the Civil Court of the District Court, ruled that the defendants Zhang Wei, etc. lost the case. The rear building should be returned to the plaintiff within one month, and the front building should be returned to the plaintiff within one year and six months. The advanced house compensates the plaintiff with a monthly rent of 200,000 legal currency from December 20, 1945, until the date of relocation. During the rental period of the front building, the plaintiff will be given 150,000 legal currency per month from the day after the relocation of the rear building. The plaintiff provides a guarantee deposit of 10 million legal currency, which is allowed for provisional execution. The remaining lawsuit and provisional execution are dismissed, and the litigation costs are borne by the defendants.</p>
<p>Do Not Hinder Cooperation for Private Gain</p>
<p>Mr. Chen then reviewed the results of the establishment of the Youth League and the need for the merger of the Party and the Youth League today. His words were frank, and he briefly said: For twenty years, the Kuomintang has been a revolutionary fighting body. Its strategies and tactics have often changed with the times and environment, and it has finally defeated the warlords and bureaucratic traitors. The current major enemy is undoubtedly the Communist Party, and the experience of twenty years of struggle proves that only the Communist Party can be the Kuomintang's opponent. The objective environment when the Youth League was established was that the Communist Party could obey the Three Principles of the People and cancel the Red Army. Therefore, the establishment of the League was to unify the small organizations within the Party and to unite the youth outside the Party. At that time, I repeatedly advocated that the Youth League should be "organized for training, not organized for the sake of organization." Today, the objective situation has changed, and revolutionary forces must be concentrated again, so there is the merger of the Party and the Youth League. In fact, the emergence and merger of the League are all strategies of the revolution. Comrades must never hinder their cooperation for personal gain today, otherwise they will make mistakes, etc. Chiang Ching-kuo then delivered a speech, emphasizing that after the merger of the Party and the Youth League, comrades should cooperate closely and should not affect unity due to prejudices. The memorial week ended near noon.</p>

<h3>Apprentice Fooled by a Gambling Den in a Restaurant; Impersonating the Daughter of the Manager of a Rubber Factory, He Cheated Six Diamond Rings from a Jewelry Store</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] At about 9:00 am the other day, a young girl came to the Hukong Jewelry Store on East Zhongzheng Road. She was about twenty years old, dressed luxuriously, and had a beautiful appearance. She claimed that her father was Wang Zutong, the manager of the Dachunghua Rubber Factory, and was currently at the Jinmen Hotel. The owner, Da Qingbin, immediately ordered his apprentice, Da Mingzhong, to bring the diamond rings and accompany her in the store's three-wheeled vehicle. Upon arrival, they did not meet him, so they went out together. The girl said clearly that my home is at 27 Lafay Fang, Fuxing Middle Road. Please take the goods back temporarily, and I will look at the goods and negotiate the price when needed, etc. That afternoon at 6:00 or 7:00 pm, a waiter from the Xin Sanhe Restaurant on West Tibet Road suddenly brought a note to the store asking them to send someone to the restaurant to look at the goods. The store still ordered the apprentice to send it. Sure enough, there were two tables of food in a certain room on the second floor, and the girl was sitting alone in the room. After looking at the goods, the girl falsely claimed that her father was entertaining guests here tonight and was talking with friends next door. She planned to send the diamond ring over and let them choose, and asked Da to wait here for a while, placing the leather tube on the table and leaving in a hurry. Unexpectedly, she never returned. After more than ten minutes, the apprentice realized he had been fooled. He asked the waiter, who said he did not know the girl. He had come to the restaurant in the afternoon to order two tables of food to entertain guests. He quickly rushed out to chase, and according to the rickshaw driver at the entrance, he caught a glimpse of her acting flustered and heading south. The apprentice Da Mingzhong returned to the store to report and then went to the police station with the owner Da Qingbin to ask for investigation. It is reported that the six diamond rings are worth more than 100 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Deputy Manager and Four Others of Tongyuan Bank Subpoenaed for Illegal Activities</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The Tongyuan Bank was accused of violating the Banking Law and was previously transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation by the Ministry of Finance. When the Ministry of Finance sent personnel to audit the bank's business, it was found that the bank had privately established secret accounts, such as the Dechang branch in the Jiufeng Silk Weaving Company. There was actually no such business. After the death of Chen Shengwu, the former manager of the bank, his medical expenses and burial expenses were all paid from the Dechang account, which did not comply with regulations. In addition, when the bank had a shortage of funds, it falsely used the name of a business to discount Shanghai Bank's funds. All of this violated Article 43 of the Banking Law. In addition to the non-compliant aspects of the business, the Ministry of Finance ordered corrections, and the remaining violations were referred to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Yu Yixin, the prosecutor in charge of the case, summoned Zhu Zanhou, the deputy manager of the bank, Hu Yuanxiang, the normal secretary, Qin Shandé, and Zhang Yuqing, the manager of Jiufeng Silk Weaving Company, yesterday. He questioned them in detail based on the bank's accounts and ordered them to return after the questioning.</p>
<h3>Movie Ticket Prices Must Rise; Another Delegation Sent to Bureau for Consultation Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Regarding the issue of movie ticket price increases, the Cinema Business Association sent another delegation to the Social Affairs Bureau for consultations yesterday. According to Zhou Hongguang, secretary-general of the association, the Social Affairs Bureau advocated deciding on price increases based on the profit and loss situation of the cinemas. The association could not agree, because the equipment and location of each theater are different, and the profit and loss situation of the business is also different. It is really difficult to comply. The authorities have always divided the control of general commodity prices into three types: limit price, negotiated price, and quoted price. The lowest ticket price for movies is the limit price, and the rest are quoted prices. Therefore, even if the Social Affairs Bureau approves it locally, each cinema is scheduled to increase prices starting on New Year's Day. In order to comply with the limit price, the first-class seat will only increase from 10,000 yuan to 12,000 yuan, while the rest will increase by a higher percentage. However, it will not exceed 80% at most.</p>

<h3>Snow and Fog in Shenyang - Eyebrows Covered with Frost, Hats Covered with Ice</h3>
<p>"When the sun is up for a while, it's cold enough to freeze the little devils to death." This is a Northeast saying that compares the terrifying cold of the sunrise in winter. Yes, the cold of the Northeast night is terrifying, and the morning is even more frightening. The chilling wind really makes people uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The trees on both sides of the road are covered with ice and frost, with rows of "snow trees and silver flowers," which are extremely magnificent. The low trees are all wearing white hats, which is another kind of fun. In addition, the hazy fog renders the morning time even colder and more mysterious.</p>
<p>The horse-drawn carriages on the street</p>
<p>Come out early to do business. The horses are covered with raincoats, and the coachmen are wearing silver armor. The wheels press on the snowy streets, making a creaking sound.</p>
<p>Elementary school students and civil servants hurried to school and the office. The girls with their mouths covered breathed on their hair, covering it with white frost, turning them into old women. The young men became white-browed and silver-haired grandpas.</p>
<p>As the sun rose higher, the haze and frost gradually disappeared. The stalls selling tofu, cabbage, and corn flour gradually increased. The shouts of "roasted sweet potatoes" and "candied haws" continued.</p>
<p>The vegetable market has frozen pork and beef, and pitifully few fish and shrimp mixed with ice. The green and white cabbage and red carrots are all covered in cotton-padded baskets. Garlic sprouts and spinach are hidden like treasures. The young ladies with servants and attendants are rarely seen in the vegetable market.</p>
<p>After noon, the peddlers selling coal and kerosene lamps shouted one after another in the streets and alleys: "Buy kerosene lamps, change lampshades, fill up kerosene..." Because there is no electricity, they are doing this</p>
<p>Abnormal business</p>
<p>Making the streets and alleys their world.</p>
<p>The "Kasuga-cho Night Market" during the Japanese era was said to be very lively and prosperous. In recent years, this area is still the prosperous area of Shenyang, but because the peddlers selling groceries on the street have been driven to the nearby streets and alleys, and the source of goods is blocked, it has gradually declined.</p>
<p>During the day, the shops with their doors and windows covered with a layer of thick frost have sparse customers. The "Youth Cooperative" is one of the places with more people coming in and out. The Koreans selling American lighters, pens, cosmetics, and some Shanghai goods - some of them are our compatriots - have glass cabinets filled with novel little things, but because of weak purchasing power, it is far from what it used to be.</p>
<p>The medical books and daily necessities left by the Japanese are now like antiques, and some people are still selling them from hand to hand. Beierma Road in Heping District is where they set up their</p>
<p>Headquarters for street stalls</p>
<p>This autumn was their golden age for a while. Now, they only do business for a while around noon on sunny days. In the weather of minus twenty or thirty degrees, many people don't have that leisure.</p>
<p>In front and behind the seven-story building of the former "Sino-Soviet Friendship Association," now renamed the "Shenyang Guest House," there are some cafes and snack bars that broadcast popular songs, and some even have small orchestras performing. In the past, many people drank tea and ate curry, especially under the Rainbow Bridge, which was very lively. Now, it is cold, there is no electricity, and there is martial law, so it only does business for a short time in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The business of the big hotels is declining. There are few people treating guests, and the girls who sing and buy happiness are secretly filled with endless sadness. All entertainment venues also have poor business and no prospects.</p>
<p>The night, the winter night, comes especially early. At five o'clock, it is dark. At six o'clock, there is martial law. Every family closes their doors and windows. There is no electricity, and it is pitch black. The people sitting under the kerosene or bean oil lamps are calculating</p>
<p>Tomorrow's expenses</p>
<p>Everyone is saying: "Today, every pound of sorghum rice sells for 4,000 circulation coupons (about 42,000 legal currency), every pound of rice sells for 5,000 yuan (about 60,000 legal currency), and every pound of kerosene sells for 12,000 yuan (144,000 legal currency). I don't know how much it will jump tomorrow. Alas, how to live!" The night wind is blowing, and the temperature is dropping, constantly falling from minus seventeen or eighteen degrees, twenty degrees, thirty degrees... The people patrolling and sounding the hours, the police enforcing martial law, and the soldiers have frost on their shoulders and ice on their hats. Holding their guns, they stomp their feet, frowning, bearing heavy and tense hearts, hoping for the dawn. (Special Correspondent Han Qingqi)</p>

<h3>Inside Story of Fire at Guiyang Clothing Depot</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Guiyang, 25th Telegram] The Second Clothing Depot of the Joint Operations Headquarters outside Nanmen Racecourse in Guiyang (belonging to the Chongqing US Aid Management Office) and the Eighteenth Clothing Depot (belonging to the Yunnan Supply Bureau) suddenly caught fire at 8:00 p.m. on the 20th and burned down. The fire was extinguished at 5:35 a.m. the next morning. According to estimates, the loss of military supplies is estimated to be more than 100 million yuan. After the reporter quickly inquired from all parties, according to reliable reports, the inside story is complicated and bizarre, and the behind-the-scenes news is still developing gradually. According to Liu Hanyu, director of the Guizhou Supply Bureau: The cause of the fire was that the guard on duty in the depot poured gasoline on cotton to wipe his clothes with a foreign candle and accidentally knocked the candle into an uncovered gasoline barrel, causing it to ignite.</p>
<p>Unable to extinguish</p>
<p>At that time, Major Gao, the person in charge of escorting the goods, was in the Far East Hotel in the city and had not returned. Although nearby people went to help, the guards were afraid that someone would take advantage of the fire to loot, and without orders, they were not allowed to enter. When the fire spread from the Second Clothing Depot to the nearby Eighteenth Clothing Depot, the people feared that the fire would spread and rushed in to help, but the guards opened fire to stop them, preventing them from entering. It was not until the fire at the Eighteenth Clothing Depot intensified that the two depots reported to the Provincial Capital Police Bureau Fire Brigade at 8:40. By the time they arrived at the scene, the fire had been burning for more than an hour. The two depots</p>
<p>Delayed reporting the fire</p>
<p>Whether there are other reasons is being paid attention to by all parties. Liu Ying, director of the Guizhou Supply Bureau, went to accompany the Provincial Party Headquarters Director Huang Guozhen to entertain all provincial staff members that night, and returned to the bureau at 8:30 after the banquet, where he heard of the fire. According to Liu, the two depots were not under the jurisdiction of the Guizhou Bureau, nor were they under supervision and command. He could have ignored them, but because they both belonged to the Joint Logistics Headquarters and in order to cherish national resources, he urgently gathered officials in the bureau. The fierce fire could not be approached, and the officials and soldiers of the bureau jumped into the fire and tried to rescue it, so the fire was extinguished at 12:00 midnight, and</p>
<p>Rescued the supplies</p>
<p>Most of them were also captured on the spot. Two duty depot soldiers and five escort officers were detained together. The depot soldiers were sent to the police station for interrogation, and the officers were taken to the bureau for interrogation. Later, at about 2:00 a.m. that night, the fire broke out again, burning the previously burned houses. A total of five houses in the two depots were burned down, and the loss of supplies, according to Director Liu's oral report and the Fire Brigade's written report to the police局局方之, differed greatly. After reporters investigated from various parties, the total value of the materials burned this time actually exceeded 100 million yuan (the fire brigade's report). The supplies burned at the Second Depot were transported from Kunming through Guiyang to Chongqing, and then transferred to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The supplies burned at the Eighteenth Depot were transported from Chongqing through Guiyang to Kunming.</p>
<p>Losses of the two depots</p>
<p>The materials included typewriters (Director Liu told reporters that the value of this material continued to be 600 billion yuan, fortunately most of it was rescued, but the fire brigade reported that very little was rescued), typewriter paper, Roosevelt wool, white wool socks, parachutes, cotton quilts, rubber shoes, and towels, among which rubber shoes and wool socks were the most lost. The broken shoes and socks after the burning piled up like earth. When they were transported from Chongqing and Kunming to Guiyang, they were divided into forty large trucks, which shows the large quantity.</p>
<p>The Guizhou Supply Bureau has now decided to seriously investigate on behalf of the higher authorities of the two depots. On the 23rd, the bureau sent Judicial Officer Yao to the Provincial Police Bureau to conduct a joint interrogation. Since criminal cases value the initial confession the most, this point must be taken seriously. (Special Correspondent Liu Xiangqi)</p>

<p>Yarn Control Committee's Cotton Purchase Business Entirely Entrusted to Textile Construction Office; Cotton Merchants Can Also Contact Textile Construction for Selling Stocked Cotton [This Newspaper's Report] Over ten representatives from the Shanghai Cotton Merchants' Association, including Liu Pingsun, went to the Yarn Control Committee yesterday morning to inquire about the future survival of cotton merchants and how to handle stocked cotton. Chairman Yuan stated that the cotton purchase business has been entirely entrusted to the Textile Construction Company. The previous idea of entrusting general cotton merchants as agents is not currently under consideration. The price of cotton sold by cotton merchants to the committee must be reasonable. Those who do not wish to sell immediately can do as they please. Those who wish to sell immediately can contact the Textile Construction Company. The representatives then visited Wu Weijing, the Deputy General Manager of the Textile Construction Company, to discuss the sale of stocked cotton and requested three points: The purchase price of cotton should be reasonable. The unemployment of cotton merchants' clients is concerning, and it is hoped that they will be used more when unified procurement of raw cotton occurs in the future. When transporting cotton to Shanghai, convenience should be provided when issuing Shanghai identification certificates. Mr. Wu stated that although the Yarn Control Committee has made a decision to entrust agents for purchase, no formal agreement has been established, and funds for cotton purchase have not been allocated, so there is nothing to discuss at this time. He also stated that all the requested points must be decided by the Yarn Control Committee, and he will speak on their behalf to leave more room for activity for cotton merchants. Cotton merchants still have business to do in the future, but they must find ways to grade cotton, strive for improvement, and refuse to purchase adulterated cotton. There is still hope for the future. It is heard that the representatives of the Cotton Merchants' Association have scheduled to continue discussing the direction of action at the association at 2:00 PM today. [Another Dispatch] The Hankou Cotton Merchants' Association, regarding the unified cotton purchase, sent a telegram to the Shanghai Cotton Merchants' Association yesterday, the text of which is as follows: To the Cotton Industry Association: Recently, the communist bandits have been disrupting the Hubei region, and Tianmen Zaoshi has been captured. The cotton-producing areas in western and northern Hubei have been affected, causing cotton merchants to hesitate and the purchase routes to be cut off. Recently, it has been heard that the government intends to control purchase and sales, which will not only cause a large amount of cotton to fall into the hands of the bandits, but also leave all cotton merchants with no hope of survival. How to jointly discuss a rescue plan relies entirely on your association's leadership to strive for unity. Our association pledges to be a backing and requests instructions on appropriate measures to take in response. Hankou Cotton Merchants' Association, Cotton Transport Industry Association, respectfully. Cotton Merchants to Register All Stocked Cotton with the Textile Adjustment Office [This Newspaper's Report] The Textile Adjustment Committee began registering all stocked cotton owned by cotton merchants yesterday. The registration period ends on January 8th of next year. The following matters should be noted when declaring registration: Companies, firms, and warehouses will be issued registration forms by the committee, which will be distributed by the industry associations for filling out. The industry associations will be responsible for reviewing and forwarding them to the committee. Individuals and those who have not joined an association should directly declare registration to the committee. When declaring registration, the amount, weight, type, packaging, and storage location of the stocked cotton should be accurately and clearly filled out. After declaring registration, if there are continued arrivals, the continued arrivals should also be reported in accordance with item 3. After declaring registration, if a transfer is necessary, the committee should be notified for record before the movement is allowed. It is heard that the committee has ordered all relevant industry associations to strictly comply with the above within the specified time. Yarn Industry Association Provides Opinion Paper The National Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Management Regulations have been approved and implemented by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 23rd of this month. Tang Zhiliang, Chairman of the Yarn Industry Association, submitted a draft opinion paper to Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, for reference yesterday afternoon. The content is summarized as follows: The unified sale of cotton yarn should be done by yarn merchants. The business of yarn merchants is not limited to replication industries in this city, but also relies on yarn merchants to supply small cloth factories in various cities and rural areas across the country. In the unified sales methods, the quantity of yarn distributed to yarn merchants should be handled in accordance with the current distribution methods. The price regulations must have the participation of yarn industry members. All yarn merchants registered as members of the Textile Construction Company should be the main targets of unified sales. Interest Rate on Reserves for Native Banks Slightly Increased by the National Bank [This Newspaper's Report] The three industry associations of silver firms, money shops, and trust companies in this city, based on the requests of their members, stated that the interest rate on deposit reserves paid to the National Bank has been 2% per week. Over the past two years, the operating expenses of the members have increased, and the deposit interest rate on the market has gradually increased to 9 jiao per 1,000 yuan. They jointly sent a letter to the National Bank requesting a slight increase in the interest rate on deposit reserves to subsidize their expenses. It is now learned that the National Bank, in order to consider the cost of operations for native banks and money shops, has approved the adoption of the interest rate approved by the bank's Audit Department as the standard. The interest rates for the previous month and December will be calculated based on the interest rates at the end of May and November, still settled in two phases (the accumulated amount after every 20 days is included in the accumulated amount for the first month of the next phase for calculation). The Shanghai interest rate will be used as the standard for the entire country, and this regulation will be implemented starting next year.

Remittances from various places are still handled in accordance with the regulations of the Four Joint Offices, and the name of the remitter and the purpose of the remittance must be strictly reviewed before the remittance can be made. This method is purely to prevent the excessive concentration of funds in Shanghai, but it still takes into account the development of production and the circulation of materials. Currently, remittances from commercial banks and money shops in Shanghai, regardless of where they are remitted to, do not require review. Remittances from national banks and bureaus from various places to Shanghai require review procedures and are handled by the responsible persons of the local banks and bureaus. Remittances from Shanghai to various places, except for South China which is subject to restrictions, do not require review.

As a result, prices rose sharply by 120,000 to 300,000 yuan compared to last week. Transactions with Tianjin merchants remained sluggish due to hesitation from buyers. Input of Industrial Soap the Association Requests Withdrawal of the Order [This Newspaper's Report] The Fourth District Soap Industry Association, on the grounds that the Transport Control Committee approved the import of industrial soap without consulting the industry's opinion, which affects the industry's survival, immediately convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors, and unanimously decided to first request the Transport Control Committee to withdraw the order immediately, and listed the three points of the harm caused by the approval of industrial soap imports as follows: Domestic products already have a phenomenon of oversupply. Therefore, the above imports are obviously not necessary, and it disregards the waste of foreign exchange. Allowing foreign goods to be imported and compete with domestic products, the costs are     , and the situation is weak. It will not only harm the industry, but also go against the country's production and construction policies. "Fatty compounds with damaged structure" have a broad meaning, including many types of soap. All kinds of soap can be imported in large quantities under this name, which is unavoidable. Money Market Eases [This Newspaper's Report] The money market eased yesterday, with an overnight interest rate of 2.3%, and a Huagu share interest rate of 2.4%. The net inflow of the Four Banks and Two Bureaus was 105.1 billion yuan, the inflow of the Central Bank was 79.5 billion yuan, the inflow of large exchanges was 69.9 billion yuan, and the inflow of foreign merchants was 30.3 billion yuan.

Liquidation Transactions Predominate, Yarn Market Continues to Decline, Cotton Cloth Sales Are Sluggish, and the Market Narrowed [This Newspaper's Report] Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation was dominated by liquidation transactions as the Gregorian New Year approached. The industry's intention to accept deliveries was slack, replication factories were watching and waiting, and customers rarely made purchases. Business was very sparse, and the market continued to decline. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell slightly to 49.1 million yuan, a decrease of 900,000 yuan compared to the weekend price. The remaining coarse and fine yarns also fell by varying amounts, ranging from 120,000 to 670,000 yuan. The cotton cloth market opened with sluggish actual sales. Customers from the Yangtze River region, due to transportation obstacles, were selling. Industry and dyeing factories were all watching and waiting as the New Year approached. Only customers from Xuzhou and other regions were absorbing supplies near the close, and the market generally saw a narrowing of prices.

The stock exchange will be closed for the New Year's holiday starting today and will reopen on January 4th, for a total of six days including Sundays. The market performance yesterday was mediocre, and the process was relatively uncertain. The     price was not considered expensive, and it was easy to rebound in the middle. Small-cap stocks became active again. China Silk, Sino-French, and Xinyi hit the limit, but due to the long holiday, many parties in the industry liquidated their positions, and floating long positions also sold. Near noon, Yongsha seemed unable to support the price, but small-cap stocks still showed good performance. The morning opened slightly strong, with spot transactions at 543 yuan and deferred transactions opening at 560 yuan. After the opening, prices rose from 539 yuan for spot transactions to 544 yuan and 566 yuan. The off-market interest rate opened at 1.95% and 2.4%, and the spot interest rate was even cheaper in the market, with spot transactions rising to 550 yuan and deferred transactions reaching a high of 573 yuan. However, they were sold down to 545 yuan and 567 yuan. At this time, people, due to rumors that deferred transactions would continue in the afternoon, small-cap stocks reappeared with glee. China Silk and Sino-French both hit the limit, and Xinyi also rose to the limit. Yongsha rose to 549 yuan and 572 yuan. Sellers rose up one after another, gradually falling back to 540 yuan and 564 yuan. The noon closing prices were 543 yuan and 568 yuan. China Silk hit the limit again.

Underwear and matches     declined, while the rest rose slightly. Xinguang stocks in deferred transactions rose by 15%. Jingfu, Quanyu, and Hua     each rose by 10%, while Yongyu, Xinyi, and Meyer rose by half a percent. Various old stocks in the off-market market remained firm, especially Dasheng, which rose another half a percent, showing unique performance. Cigarettes Continue to Rise Yesterday, the cigarette market saw strong buying as industry players covered their positions and new buyers participated. The market was increasingly     , with more buyers than sellers, and the rising trend intensified. As a result, ten brands of British American Tobacco and Old Knife tobacco soared by 1.35 million to 1.6 million yuan compared to Saturday. In addition, Sino-foreign cigarettes and canned cigarettes also rose by 2,000 to 10,000 yuan.

<p>Interpretation of the Title "Great Learning" in Xuejin, Not Biased The "Great" character in "Great Learning" used to be pronounced like "Tai," based on Zheng Kangcheng's commentary, referring to its location, in contrast to elementary school; Zhu Xi later changed the pronunciation to the original character, referring to its book, in contrast to the learning of children. Zhu Xi said: "The Book of Great Learning is the method by which the ancient great learning taught people" (Preface to Chapters and Sentences of the Great Learning); he also said: "Great Learning is the learning of great people." (Commentary on the Classic in Chapters and Sentences of the Great Learning) The so-called "ancient great learning" and "learning of great people" were the highest level of the ancient education system. Their age was above childhood, and their learning progressed from "the etiquette of sweeping, responding, advancing, and retreating, and the literature of rites, music, archery, and chariot driving" to "the way of investigating things, rectifying the mind, cultivating oneself, and governing others." The age stipulated by the education system was such, and the teaching materials were also such. Considering that what it teaches is the way of governing others, the opposition between "great people" and "small people" is precisely like the opposition between "those who govern others" and "those who are governed by others." The learning of great people is the learning of governing others, just as the learning of small people is the learning of being governed by others. Those who are governed by others only need to learn "the etiquette of sweeping, responding, advancing, and retreating, and the literature of rites, music, archery, writing, and arithmetic"; as for those who govern others, they must further learn the way of "investigating things, rectifying the mind, cultivating oneself, and governing others," and the age for learning it cannot be above childhood. From this perspective, the Great Learning is the book in which our Confucian scholars speak of governing others. Because its governance is based on people (according to the Confucian school, people govern), it also extends to cultivating oneself and rectifying the mind, and since there is no way to correct oneself without learning, it details the matter of investigating things; this is why its book goes from speaking of governance to speaking of being a person and learning, and ultimately returns to speaking of governance. Summarizing the method of governance, it lies only in practicing benevolence, so Chapter 3 of the commentary says: "For the ruler, stopping at benevolence." Benevolence means being benevolent to the people and loving things. We and things are both born of heaven and earth. The forms and bodies are different, but the nature and principles are the same. Therefore, from a small perspective, we distinguish between people, things, self, and others. From a large perspective, people, things, and I are all one body. The difference in forms and bodies arises from the obstruction of the senses of the ears and eyes; the sameness of nature and principles arises from the communication of the senses of the mind. The senses of the ears and eyes are the small body, and the senses of the mind are the great body, so Mencius said: "Following the great body is being a great person, following the small body is being a small person." (Gao Zishang) Extending it, my small body, people and things are the great body</p>
