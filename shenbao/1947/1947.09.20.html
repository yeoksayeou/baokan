<h3>張羣院長出巡抵瀋　宋子文任粵省主席　盧漢飛赴東北慰問滇軍</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕張羣出長行政院後，十九日晨九時首次出巡，張氏係乘軍用　機巡飛東北，政院新聞局副局長鄧友德，參事周君亮，富伯平，秘書游建文等隨行。日前來京之　主席盧漢，亦同機赴東北，慰勞在該處之滇籍國軍。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕行政院秘書長甘乃光稱：張院長出巡任務有二：（一）爲視察各省執行政令情形，（二）爲探求各地民間疾苦，俾資籌謀救濟。張氏將先視察瀋陽，長春，然後遄赴華北各重要地區巡視，約十日後返京，其後又將出發台灣，華中，華南各地，作第二次之巡視。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十九日電〕行政院長張羣，十九日午十二時四十五分飛抵瀋陽。滇主席盧漢等同來，除馬占山，張作相迎於機塲外，其餘人員均趕至途中。張氏下機後，旋與陳兼主任誠同軍至行轅第二招待所午餐，盧漢亦在座。午餐後，張氏曾訪晤東北各元老，並與行轅高級將領談話，藉得多知東北一般情形。張氏擬留瀋三天，考察一般政務，並擬赴撫順，鞍出視察工鑛，然後再赴長春一行。張氏表示，在東北將以多看，多說，不吃諸節約原則，俾能多有所獲。此外並悉，盧漢此次係奉陳誠之邀，來瀋慰問及視察滇省在東北各部隊，盧氏表示，係來東北看看，隨機帶來芥菜，罐頭等雲南土產，贈與滇籍袍澤。盧氏不日並將赴錦西一帶慰問。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十九日電〕張院長十九日未來平，據關係方面消息，張氏十九日晨九時餘直飛東北，十二時餘已到潘，何時來平，尙無確息。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕行政院十九日晨第九次臨時會議通過，任命宋子文爲廣東有政府委員兼主席。羅卓英另有任用，免本兼各職。據悉羅氏定十月一日交代，宋氏則將於下月初赴廣州腹新。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕國府廿日令：廣東省政府委員兼主席羅卓英，另有任用，羅卓英應免本兼各職，此令。任命宋子文爲廣東省政府委員兼主席，此令。</p>
<h3>張院長在瀋談話　東北入超情形須予改善　民間疾苦決謀解除之方</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十九日電〕張羣十九日下午四時在招待記者席上稱：本人主政院後，首次出門即來東北，可說明中央重視東北，對東北問題謀有所解決。收復東北，安定東北，建設東北，我國策永久不變，全國同胞，子子孫孫，新陳代謝，亦爲此而努力。過去東北爲出超區城，現爲入超，須急謀改善，民間疾苦，我亦觀察實際情形，謀解除之方。關於東北運出鋼鐵，換回外國香烟及東北機車廠產品交部不作充份利用等不合理現象，必定注意研究改善。修正進出口及外匯結匯辦法施行後，情形良好，出口數字已有滑加，天津上月達三七〇餘億元。關於普選，政府從未考慮延期，政黨提名，國民黨已規定從下而上辦法，民·靑兩黨亦在辦理，但並無比率規定。我國外交，向持自主立塲，並不受魏德邁報吿內容影響，如初步對日和會，我國主如十一國三分之二表決制中，應包括四强中之三强。又否決權問題，我國主張建議性案件不應使用否決權，而破壞性案件，則應使用，此二大問題均與美·蘇不同。關於接收大連問題，我堅主派軍前往，因大連在商務上爲自由港，在國家主權上。我軍得前往接收，但交涉現尙未能順利成功。</p>
<h3>否決權問題不解決　我將不參加和會　王外長談對日和約立場　主張先行提交遠東委會討論</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約十九日電〕中國外長王世杰博士，十九日單獨會見合衆社記者時宣稱，如美國邀請十一國立即召開對日和會，中國將與蘇聯一致加以拒絕。王氏稱：「中國之所以不能接受美國邀請，理由與蘇聯相同，即美國建議中不包括四强之否決權。中國經長期苦鬥，始能戰勝日本，設和會不能保障其權益，中國實無從參加。惟中國政府擬折衷美蘇之立塲，而要求將對日和約　問題，移交十一國遠東委員會討論。小國此項建議，視蘇聯建議之四强會議爲高，蓋可使更多對日作戰之國家有代表出席。同時遠東委員會之程序，對取得四强間之一致早有明文保證」。渠希望此建議能爲華盛頓所接受，又稱：「如此一召開和會之僵局能予打開，而和約最後亦能全部同意，則本人認爲全世界局勢將大大好轉」。</p>
<p>王氏預料本屆大會對解決世界之緊張局勢恐將甚鮮成就。面臨世界之基本間題，乃戰爭結束兩年後，仍無和平可言。聯合國大會議程，對此項問題毫不加以考慮。</p>
<p>主席與捷克大使握手（勵志社攝）</p>
<h3>王外長中文演詞　同時譯為英法語</h3>
<p>各國代表戴耳機靜聽</p>
<p>〔中央社佛拉辛草地十八日電〕王外長本日於聯合國大會中所發表之開幕詞，實係聯合國全體大會中以我國語言作重要演說之第一次。王外長步上講台時，掌聲雷起。五十五國代表咸立即運用耳機聆取其演說。此演說歷時十五分鐘，攝影機，電影機，電視機，紛紛轉動，銀光四射，會塲中因有人才及設備之便利，故王外長演說之英法語　詞，同時自耳機中傳出大會通用之兩種語言。此係本年新制度之首次運用，凡以英·法·中·俄·西班牙語五種正式語言中任何一種語言發表之演調，均同時譯爲英法語。各代表佩戴其耳機，即可收聽。</p>
<p>〔又電〕王外長於聯大會發表演說後，未幾即舉行首次記者招待會，外長聲稱，中國贊成美方之建議，主張大會討論協助朝鮮儘速獲得獨立之方法與途徑。王氏檢討朝鮮局勢稱，大會能否就解決朝鮮問題謀致令人滿意之計劃，殊屬疑問，而解決朝鮮問題之關鍵，乃在於中美英蘇四國能否就大會所決議之任何方案獲致協議。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕外部對日和約審議委會，十九日下午五時開會，劉次長師舜主持，出席吳鼎昌·胡煥庸·柳克述·簡貫三·　德柏·于樹德·萬燦·張慶楨·劉士篤·黃正銘等十餘人。會中曾就對日和約問題，廣泛交換意見，僉認蘇聯若不參加，我國亦不便參加。對表決權問題，多數認爲「四國同意權」最爲適當。關於天皇制度之存廢，吳鼎昌認「天皇」二字殊不妥當，應改爲「日皇」或「日王」此外對於賠款·軍備等，咸曾提及，並根據遠東委會所擬對投降後日本之華本政策，加以討論。</p>
<h3>參會對和約主張　駐委會修正通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕參政會對日政策研究會所擬具之「對於對日和約之主張案」，已於十九日晨舉行之參政會駐會委會中提出討論，並經秘書長部力子等之修正，決改爲建議案。同時決定該案之前言部份可予通過，後半之條款部份，文字上尙待斟酌，除有關程序部份之第一，二款予以通過，隨同前言首先公布，並送請政府參考外，其餘條款再行審查。該案提付討論時，多數參政員對第十四款所列「和約之簽定應堅持九月十八日在中國瀋陽舉行」句認爲規定過於硬性，同時亦包含充分之報復性之意義，應予修正，旋決定更爲「和約之簽定　應在中國舉行」。</p>
<h3>彼得羅夫即返任　中蘇邦交可能轉入佳境</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕蘇駐華大使彼得羅夫，短期內可來京返任。我駐蘇使館已爲其護照簽證。此間蘇使館對此今日已予以證實，唯確切日期尙無所知。據權成人士稱，蘇聯對我國近來於外交方面所持態度及所採行動注意之結果，已較前有所了解，昔日過多之疑慮，亦大爲袪减。彼得羅夫之返任，除帶來中蘇間若干癥結將獲解決之希望外，並含有一極重大之意義，中蘇邦交可能轉入佳境，在若干國際事務上密切合作，促進兩國睦誼。</p>
<h3>關吉玉將任糧次</h3>
<p>〔本報瀋陽十九日電〕關吉玉將調糧部次長，不久即赴京。</p>
<h3>糧部適應當前需要　訂糧食轉口辦法　糧商機關採購均須核准</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕關於糧食管理及轉口一事，糧部負責人頃談稱：年來我國糧食政策，對於國內糧食，向以自由流通爲原則，藉收盈虛互劑之效果，現値動員戡亂時期，軍　民食均極重要，爲配合需要，對目前各地糧食，不能不加以適宜之管理，並訂定糧食轉口辦法，呈准施行，其主要意義有三：（一）避免糧食資匪。（二）防止糧食外流。（三）嚴防不正當糧商挾其大量資金從事囤積投機。今年長江各省均吿轉收，華北各省則旱災水患相繼而至，兩廣水災亦極嚴重，救濟災民，需糧至急，而本年明年所需軍糧，因華南北災歉原因，大部份亦須於長江各省籌辦，是則購運數量，應如何妥爲規定，使產區不致因購糧過多而刺激糧價，銷區獲得相當調劑，軍糧並得供求無缺，糧食轉口辦法之規定，實爲適應當前需要不得已之措施。合法糧商申請購糧，只須申請手續與所提證件符合規定，即可核准，如因申請購糧而有遠法行爲，一經查實，無論何人，均應負法律上之責任。至南北各省市政府或機關法團，有須向長江各省區購糧時，亦應按照規定，先向本部申請，俾便統籌辦理，不可逕自派員先向各地採購，且各機關法團對於委托購運之公司行號承辦糧食，必須合法糧高，並應加以監督，務使糧到當地得用，勿任商人中途脫舊，從中漁利，又所辦之糧，必須一批到後，次批方准着手辦理。本部對於合法糧商購辦糧食運銷，每一商人亦須俟其一批之糧已銷，次批之糧方予核准起運。盼各界充分予以合作，使政府之糧食政策得以圓　實施。</p>
<h3>美對我國批評　以往過今日苛責　王外長稱均屬過份</h3>
<p>〔中央社佛拉辛草地十八日電〕王外長抵美以來，各方多詢以渠對美國最近對中國之批評，有何意見？外長今日答復曰：「過去美國之讚譽，與今日美國之批評，均屬過份。」王氏於首次中國記者招待會上，追述五六年前美國輿論及人民，均認中國爲完美無瑕，讚譽備至，彼時中國實當之有愧，今則大部份美國報紙及論者，均趨向另一極端。外長希望美國人士，能以適當之眼光看中國之情勢，而不自此一極端，變爲另一極端。</p>
<h3>港督將來京訪問　我外部復電歡迎</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕港督葛量洪，將於十月初來京作友誼訪問，外部已復電表示歡迎。</p>
<h3>捷克駐華大使　李立克呈國書</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕捷克駐華大使李立克，十九日午十一時在國府覲見蔣主席，呈遞到任國書，外部代理部務次長劉師舜，國府文官長吳鼎昌，參軍長薛岳，典禮局長吳思豫副局長劉迺藩，外部禮賓司長凌其　，帮辦王季　，等均參加典禮，並由王帮辦任翻譯。</p>
<h3>香港又面臨工潮</h3>
<p>公用事業醞釀大罷工　〔路透社香港十九日電〕香港又復面臨大罷工之發生，電車工人今日下午與資方及港政府勞工局官員，會談後，定今夜開會，決定是否於明日起能工，工人要求增加工資百分之二百，資方使允增加百分之四十。同時香港各大公用事業之工人，亦均已提出增加工資之聲請，故電車工人之罷工，可能引起其他公用事業工人之罷工。</p>
<h3>主席贈艾帥勛章　由何應欽將軍代表授予</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十八日電〕我國政府爲艾森豪威爾元帥在戰時功績彪炳，成就卓異，特於十八日授以特級大緩雲麾勳軍，幷由何應欽將軍代表蔣主席在艾帥辦公室授勳，我大使館代表暨陸軍武官處人負，以及美空軍司令史巴茲將軍等均蒞塲觀禮，授勳獎狀，由蔣主席親筆簽字，內稱：「艾帥於戰時曾表現卓絕之能力，尤以在歐洲戰塲盟國遠征軍總司令任內，以最少數之犧牲，使德國投降，卒於亞洲促使日本之崩潰，而結束大戰。」艾帥於接受勳章時，對蔣主席表示敬意，並祝主席政躬康泰。</p>
<h3>魏德邁向杜魯門建議　美繼續經濟援華　調查報告由羅維持轉呈</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十八日電〕魏德邁將軍十八日晨十時三十八分（上海時間十九日晨零時三十八分）飛抵此間。據魏氏新聞顧問華生談稱：魏德邁之建議書，包括美國繼續在經濟上援助中國之建議在內。全文極長，有數千字之多，並有附件多件。魏德邁將軍偕其隨員飛抵機塲時，拒絕有所評述。又據華生稱：魏氏晋謁總統之期未定大約須待羅維特閱讀其報吿書後，再行決定日期。至目前爲止，除非羅維特或杜魯門總統另有決議，魏氏可謂業已完成其任務。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓十八日電〕魏德邁之報吿已在夏威夷停留時完成，大概將於星期五提交代理國務卿羅維特。魏氏此後仍將復任第二軍總司令一職（在馬利　之米特堡）。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十八日電〕魏德邁本日抵華盛頓，並携有對我國事實調查後長達數千字之全部報吿，以及向杜魯門提供關於美國應在遠東採取次一步驟之建議。魏氏於機塲拒絕就中國之行發表意見，並即離此赴附近之米德堡，復履第二軍軍長之職。魏氏定明日向代理國務卿羅維特提出報吿書。渠與杜魯門會談日期未定，唯據魏氏發言人表示，在馬歇爾離職期內，遞呈總統之報吿書，將首先經過羅維特，然後送達白宮。外傳魏氏自我國携帶秘密文件三大箱，魏氏發言人則稱，在華調查所獲大批資料，已列入數千字之報吿書中，幷有巨帙附錄，故報吿書頗長。發言人繼謂，除非代理國務卿羅維特欲使魏德邁將軍再返中國，否則在報吿書遞交總統後，魏氏赴華使命即可認爲完畢。渠拒絕闡明上說是否可解釋爲國務院欲使魏氏返中國出任駐華大使。</p>
<h3>參政會駐委會議席上　陳啓天報告經濟設施　擬具紡工計劃促煤礦復工增產</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕經濟部長陳啓天十九日晨出席參駐會，報告施政情形，略分兩部份，（一）扶助民營事業，增加生產力量，（二）獎勵國際貿易，爭取外匯，平衡收支。旋陳氏就煤礦工業，紡織工業等情形，加以說明，對於煤礦工業者，因東北戰事之影響，各地普遍發生煤荒現象，經商同國防部設法護礦，同時商由四聯總處，謀以貸款增產擴充。紡織工業之現况，我國現有四百餘萬錠，但未能全數開工，據專家估計，需一千五百萬錠，始敷應用，故不足數甚鉅，同時，我國現輸出者僅紡織品，故紡織工業亟待改進。又關於扶助民營工業部份，經濟部在滬·滇·穗·津各大都市設工商輔導處，預定今年年內能將全國各大都市之工廠概况及其實况調查竣事，然後始可進而求發展謀擴充。對於工廠器材之配售供應，在戰時曾設有工廠器材總庫，勝利後撤銷，其管轄工廠器材部份，則撥歸物資供應局，惟對廠商極感不便，故現已商四聯總處予各廠商對購買工廠器材之外匯寬予准允，以便於入口，同時在工商輔導處下設立工廠器材組。關於調整紗布之產銷問題，首在增加棉產，根據統計，今年比去年增加一倍收成，去年爲五百萬擔，今年有一千一百萬擔，欲敷全國人民應用，尙差三分之一，經濟部已設有棉產改進處，以四五〇億爲推廣改良之用，盼明年能增加。其次關於中紡紗價事，自紡管會成立後，紗價爲機動性之議價，故目前情形已好轉，再次爲收購春繭，今春共以二千七百億貸效收購蘇浙皖三省春繭，以爲換取外匯之用，現秋繭即登塲，已貸款一千三百三十億，以三百三十億收購川繭，餘仍爲蘇浙皖三省。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕參政會駐委會，十九日晨會議，經濟部長陳啓天報吿畢，參政員紛紛提出詢問及建議，均經陳部長答覆，由陳氏答覆中，得悉：（一）經濟部正擬具五年至十年之紡織工業計劃，對分區（尤其於棉產區）設置紗廠之事，亦在注意中。（二）京滬區月需煤廿六萬噸，主要來源爲開　煤礦，月約供給十萬噸，淮南煤礦約四萬噸，其他由台灣之煤礦供應，經部現正促使長江一帶未復工之煤礦早日復工。</p>
<p>陳氏答覆各項詢問　對日貿易利多害少</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕經濟部長陳啓天，十九日晨在參會駐委會中報吿經部施政概况後，復答覆各參政員之詢問。</p>
<p>伍純武首先詢問對日貿易問題旣是主動在我，但根據事實言，日本輸出者係工業出產品，我國出產仍係農產品；是否將再陷過去覆轍，而投降於日本之侵略政策（農業中國工榮日本），故對開放對日貿易是否應予考慮？陳答，對日貿易之開放，係旣定事實，吾人僅能言參加與否，如中國不參加，對日本並無甚影響，對我國則有影響，國務會議決定參加，政院僅係執行政策，經部只能在管理上予以嚴格之限制。陳氏並認此乃中國人對日本人之貿易，而非日本人對中國人之貿易，在於主動，利多而害少。</p>
<p>薛明劍詢問電費增價原因，陳答，電價增加原因有三：（一）一般物價上漲。（二）增添機器，需要昂貴之外匯，致成本過高。（三）工人工資太高，各種公用事業價格，政府擬定一標準，按標準定價，現政府正定標準及其計算方式中。</p>
<p>陳紹賢詢以吾人需棉甚多，但最好能儘量發展增產，以達到自給自足之境。同時，建議政府購買印棉，藉免大量消耗美匯。陳答，棉產管理處將儘量設法，使全國各產棉區得以推廣增產。關於收購印棉，中紡近已定購一部份，最近曾購美棉三次，第一次四千萬担，第二次二千萬担，第三次二千五百担。購美棉之原因，在於美棉不必現款，而係貸款，印棉則必須現款。國內紡織事業之管理，中紡公司正估價中，已決定百分之三十留國營，餘百分之七十出售，辦法則組出售國營事業監理委會擬定之。</p>
<p>尹述賢稱：魏德邁對政府之批評爲無能而貪汚，有兩事爲證，一爲關於舞弊者，燃管會從津浦路運煤至滬，必經浦口，然在浦口車站須受檢查，如檢查遲一日，即將被罰，故檢查者即可任意延遲時日，被檢者爲怕被罰，即願先行交納各稱費用，以資賄賂，並提早時日，此其一。中紡公司紗價，每件規定五十萬元，外價爲百萬元，外人請購，即使獲得紡管曾之批准，亦須向主管者付包袱費，每件達四十萬，此其二。另一爲蕯凡奇三峽水利發電計劃，應即開始。陳答以可予調查，惟目前已有改善辦法。</p>
<p>獎勵青年出國辦法　決定送請政府參考</p>
<p>緩期辦理各種選舉案保留</p>
<p>〔本報南京十九日電〕參政會駐會委員會十九日晨舉行第五次會，江庸主席，經，濟部長陳啓天出席報吿當前經濟措施及經濟部工作近况等，並答覆各參政員之詢問甚詳，繼討論提案，（一）請政府獎勵優秀靑年出國留學考察，以資復興，而利建國案，其辦法中說明「凡已得國外大學許可，並經贈予獎學金或津貼之自費學生，無論在國內大學已否畢業，應由敎育部一律核發留學證書，俾可出國深造」。經討論後，決議送請政府參考。（二）請政府緩期辦理各種選舉案，原案列舉辦法兩點：（一）請政府迅速以通訊方式征求各國大代表意見，（二）請政府迅速召開立法委員會議，研討緩期辦理選舉問題，提案人蔡芷生，　前起立說明，強調當前并非適當之選舉時期與環境，經各參政員發言，認爲提出之時間過遲，政府已在積極推行選務之際，不必再行提出，當決定該案保留。</p>

<h3>陳啓天報告經濟設施　上文接第二版　六七八三個月物價波動情形</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十九日電〕經濟部長陳啓天，十九日在參政會駐會委員會報吿物價問題，對最近六七八三月物價波動情形，有詳細分析，陳氏首稱：戰後物價波動，其基本原因不外（一）財政收支失衡，通貨不斷增加，（二）生產停頓，物質缺乏，（三）交通破壞，貨運停滯，（四）遊資作祟，投械盛行諸端。本年物價，自四月起開始波動，經濟緊急措施方案所造成之短期的穩定局面，全部動搖，迄五月中旬，始稍吿穩定，是時全國平均物價，約於戰前之一九·六八五倍。陳氏繼乃就本年六七八三月物價波動情形，作逐月分析謂，六月份物價指數爲二·五六四·二五六，係京·滬·渝，津，穗·漢六大城市躉售物價之平均指數（以廿六年上半數爲基期以六月）。本月上中兩旬，一般物價仍續呈平穩狀態，及至下旬，則重起波灡，一週之間，黑市外匯幾升一倍，各種物價亦莫不追踵直上，本月份六大城市，較上月平均上漲率，爲百分之廿一，其原因則爲：（一）銀根鬆弛，游資充斥，（二）工資因解凍而大爲增加，（三）公用事業貼補部份取銷，相繼調整價格，（四）美國進出口銀行五億美元貸款，到期失效，（五）華北局勢緊急，游資汹湧南移。七月份物價指數，爲三·一一五·四九二，所謂七月漲風，並不如預測之大，其原因爲：（一）魏德邁特使來華，市塲心理認爲乃美國援華之前奏，中國經濟情勢又能好轉，（二）美國國務院發表聯合公吿，對日私人貿易，將於八月十五日起開放，日本廉價工業製品可能拋入遠東市塲，從事競爭，（三）七月初上海成立「經濟監察會報」，決定設立金鈔棉紗糧食燃料食油等偵查組，嚴厲執行檢查工作，（四）國家行局積極抽緊頭寸，（五）東北華北戰局穩定，游資又重回流。七月上半月中，上海銀根緊迫異常，物價欲漲無力，惟其他各地雖唯上海馬首是瞻，但因感應較遲，故漲勢仍甚猛烈。八月份六大城市，較上月平均上漲率，爲百分之廿一，八月份物價指數，爲三，四五八·七四九，各地物價漲率，雖參差不一，但大體尙屬穩定，其原因爲：（一）本月份農忙李節，市面較爲蕭條，（二）各地糧食尙稱豐收，（三）政府改訂外匯管理及進出口貿易辦法，商塲反應尙隹，（四）　魯各地戰局好轉，（五）動員戡亂實施綱要，陸續付諸實施，物價管制工作愈益加强，人心亦較穩定，本月份現僅及半，各地物價，似又有上揚趨勢，米糧紗布上漲尤形猛烈，其原因：（一）魏德邁離華聲明，顯示美國經濟援助尙待考慮，（二）日本商品由於我國限制之嚴格，無從湧入傾銷，（三）匪軍竄擾鄂皖華中，遊資東進，（四）英匯黃金官價，微有升高。至經濟部主管之物資紗布與煤炭兩項，陳部長認爲四月來波動情形，較之一般物價尙稱平緩，而七八兩月，且均有下跌現象，至煙煤價格，七月份上漲率，仍已超出一　物價，但此乃取銷貼補之故，不免漲勢較陡，然如以未實行貼補前一月份之價格指數平均計算，仍未見超出一般物價。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>申報二萬五千號紀念辭</h3>
<p>時日遷　，篇帙累積，月復月，年復年，自申報問世，迄於今茲，以號計，適得二萬五千號，以年論，乃爲七十有五年。此不可謂非近代文化史中燦爛之一葉。吾人珍視，吾入歡扑，自有其深切之意義，而不容　循於緘默。夫七十爲人生古稀之齡，自其消極言之，或不免於遲暮，自其積極言之，方有欣乎獲得。經涉旣富，壯志不隳，趨事赴機，何往蔑宜？申報亦猶是也！亙七十五年之彌歷吁衡，曼衍魚能，洞囑之已審，滄桑變故，默察於無形。其體騐與磨　，蓋與日而俱進。今且以其日新月異之姿態，爲讀者盡委宛酣暢之供輸。振刷無止境，則　暮之感可袪；甘苦有深得，則肆應之道愈閎。此吾人於悅忻鼓舞之餘，所引爲私　慰藉者也。申報之得能蒸蒸日上，綿延勿替者，誠由各方人士之　　，萬千讀者之　進，而在事同人心血之沃培，　瀋之灌溉，殷勤掬　，神　形　，尤有其不可泯沒之功烈焉。然而天演公例，新陳徂謝，含齒戴髮之倫，寗能踰越斯限？回溯數十寒暑中，同人之盡瘁而　化者，老病而乞休者，蓋不知其凡幾矣。諸君子職位雖去，　緒長存。吾人欲維申報於永恒，要不能不式　前賢之矩　；吾人緬懷前　之忠　，更不能不力謀申報之恢弘。肩鉅責重，瞻顧匪易。此又吾人於悅　　　之餘，所引爲悚惶惕勵者也。</p>
<p>申報　刊於前清同治十一年，即西暦一八七二年。其時歐美風氣，流漸未　，國人關於報紙之意識，　多　焉而勿曉，偶得傳觀者，邸鈔而外，亦唯香港唐字新聞而已。正式新聞紙之頒行，要以申報為之　矢。雖草創伊始，規模未備，而編排清晰，已有可觀。以視英國之倫敦泰晤士報，美國之紐約時報，未許比　，差堪接武。當申報載誕之日，正國家多事之秋。時則太平天國軍事　告結束，陜甘　亂，次第　平。清　　業，就表　言，似有　　　展之　，而　　實際，已成一蹶不振之勢。嗣後外交則每况愈下，內政則窳敗日甚。相繼而起之動盪局面：有中法釁端，有中日戰爭，有戊戌政變，有義和團之亂，有八國聯軍之役。凡茲險　危難之遭際，皆申報所經見而歷載者。消息騰布，洪繊備錄。使壤隔之視聽，藉一紙而溝通；閉塞之羣情，經啓迪而惕悟。是爲申報少壯時代之宣力，亦即民國以前獲致之成就也。</p>
<p>清社旣　，政體一新。申報以其自強不息之精神，弼成政教之設施。端緒作正義自由之闡揚，運用充實之力量，弼成政敎之設施。端緒浩繁，非可殫述。三十六年來，時事紛更，張弛屢見。申報先後所錄記者，如洪憲僭稱之覆減，張勳復辟之失敗，北方軍閥之崩潰，國民革命之成功，成能區分是非，明其向背。論無偏頗，言成軌則。而在神聖抗戰期間，顚沛造次之中，橫逆疊至，摧剝頻加，尤爲創鉅痛深舉生難忘之厄。幸於舉國騰歡聲中，克覩山河之重光，而申報亦於焉獲得其新生。光陰荏苒，忽忽兩年。勝利後之中國，雖瘡痍未復，戰亂踵生，而全國人士，在蔣主席英明領導之下，披荊斬棘，協力同心，預計和平統一，為期當不在遠。申報以悠久之歷史，謀刧後之復興，自應更矢淬厲，益圖奮發，以毋負讀者之維獲，曲盡報人之天職。輒藉時會，一掬愚忱，申吾人之願望，用就正於讀者。</p>
<p>第一：報紙爲社會敎育之工具，有潛移默運之功能。文化愈演進，報紙之需要愈殷；讀者愈廣泛，報紙之效力愈宏。有人喩報紙爲魔術家所操之杖，言其蘊藏神秘於無限也。有人指報紙爲精神糧食，言其能療知識之饑渴也。報紙之權威性在此，報紙之羈絆力亦在此。唯其有權威性，故報道必須客觀而忠實，勿妄用其權威。唯其有覊絆力，故評論必須負責而愼重，無自陷於羈絆。紐約時報之新聞格言曰：『値得印出者，方得爲新聞。』勃萊耶氏（Bleyer）亦曰：『良好之新聞，必爲多數人所耐味。』此皆不失為寶貴之信條，甚足資吾人之攻　。申報夙以謹嚴爲依歸，式符斯旨；今後尤當恪守其本位，永無所渝。</p>
<p>第二：報紙爲推行民主政治之先鋒，有指導社會基層之責任。我國制憲已定，大選在即，輿論力量之顯示，自將更趨於重要。如何講求效能之發揮，促成民主政治之實現，實為吾人當務之急。至於言論自由，誠在必爭之列，然亦自有其限度，非可濫用。吾人深信濫用言論自由之惡果，不啻毀滅言論自由之真諦。此中出入，寗可勿辨。吾人以為報人最低之信念：對遭受寃抑者必予申訴，恣作威福者必予排擊，惡意誹謗，可置勿理，黃色新聞，寗付　如。吾人必須以眞正言論自由爲凖繩，作多數善良人民之喉舌。</p>
<p>第三：報紙隨時代而進展，世界具變衍之本能。印報入世七十五年，論資雖同老馬，衡力難稱識途。故一意以學習博進取，決不願自封於故步。對先進國家報紙之優點，及其技術所表現，參酌不厭周詳，借鏡務期進取。例如：通信網之密布各地，採訪之力主翔捷，印刷之曲圖改良，編排之勉求醒目，推銷之務臻普　，皆在吾人切實計劃之中，以期漸底於完密。申報爲國內有數之報紙，顧持以較英美民主國家，猶事事難與等量。他且勿問，即就銷路而言，美國芝加哥論壇報日銷百萬份，英國每日快報日銷三百萬份，挈彼衡茲，實爲懸絕。然而吾人頗堪自信，經不斷努力之結果，未必無齊驅之一日。</p>
<p>吾人所以不憚煩瑣，爲此喋喋者，良以七十五年非簡短之歲月，二萬五千號達相當之成數。及時檢討，分所應有。撫念過去之辛勞，倍思策勉於來日！吾人始終懷臨深履薄之戒懼，知晏然自滿爲非計。試以二萬五千號爲一階段，則無數階段，儘在　後，山林　路，茲為造端。吾人極願與諸同業相提携，殷誠　求合作於讀者，以　致更大更深之進步，以發揚申報無涯之休光！</p>

<h3>維辛斯基在聯大演說　率直拒絕美建議　要求制止各國惡意宣傳</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約弗　辛草地十八日電〕蘇聯外次維辛維辛斯基今日在聯大中致辭，斷然拒絕馬歇爾所提設立五十五國臨時性和平與安全委員會之議，斥為明顯的違背憲章之建議，意圖規避安理會，并聲明蘇聯決奮力反對此一建議。維氏於促請大會就抗不遵從其指令之行為，包括美軍駐在中國之事，採取　裁行動後，復提出決議案，要求禁止以原子武器作為任何國家之軍備。該決議案并嚴厲譴責戰爭投機份子，要求各國政府對從事戰爭宣傳者施以刑事處罰。維辛斯基復嚴辭抨擊英美兩國，指彼等違背聯合國機構之創立原則，在若干情形下并直接違抗聯大會之決議。指出此等利用聯合國機構作為個人自私及狹窄利益的工具之政策，足以削弱聯合國機構之地位及力量。</p>
<p>維氏所述各點分述如下：（一）英美企圖不顧聯合國機構，脫離該機構而執行其政治措施，此一政策與憲章以及聯合國機構之創立宗旨均相違背，應請大會嚴重注意此一政策造成威脅。</p>
<p>（二）聯合國機構諸活動中最重要的挫折，為裁軍計劃的不滿意狀態，英美無意裁　軍備，多方阻撓裁軍之實現，貝文外相最近之聲明，可以　明何以裁軍問題處於如此不滿意的狀況。宣布原子彈及其他集團破壞力武器之問題，尤令人感覺關切，蘇聯已當採取各種步驟，以解決原子問題，但均遭遇抗阻，主要之抗阻者為美國，蘇聯雖　意有嚴格的原子國際管制，但絕對不能接受由外國干涉原子生產工廠。</p>
<h3>抨擊美援歐計劃　堅決維護否決權</h3>
<p>（三）以言杜魯門主義及馬歇爾援歐計劃，均為違背聯合國原則之企圖，意欲強迫他國接受其政策，所謂美國對希土之援助，不過為一種政治武器耳。馬歇爾援歐計劃為強迫歐洲國家倚賴美國獨占資本之企圖，并　在歐洲結成敵對東歐及蘇聯之企圖，使歐洲　為兩大陣綫。</p>
<p>（四）馬歇爾建議之設立五十五國和平與安全委員會一案，乃規避安理會之企圖，顯然違背憲章，蘇聯代表團決反對之。蘇聯要求無條件遵從諸強一致同意之原則，蘇聯當奮力維護此一原則，意即反抗任何企圖修改否決權制度之企圖。</p>
<h3>涉及美軍留華事</h3>
<p>（五）聯合國大會應就下列抗令事件，採取行動：（甲）英軍駐在埃及希臘及外約　；（乙）美軍駐在中國；（丙）阿根廷之不顧上屆大會決議，派遣大使駐在馬德里；（丁）南匪之未能提出西南匪之託管協定。</p>
<p>（六）印度尼西亞之事件，絕對的祇能稱之為侵略行為。</p>
<p>（七）伊朗問題應自安理會議程剔除，英美之保留此一問題，顯具特別作用。</p>
<p>（八）對於希臘北　諸國之指責，乃毫無根據而的指責。</p>
<p>（九）美國在聯大中提出朝鮮問題，為違背四強莫斯科協定。</p>
<h3>暗示蘇無意戰爭</h3>
<p>維氏　曰，若干國家之報紙已在發動新戰爭的宣傳，尤其是美國及服從美國之諸國若土耳其等之報紙，巳從事瘋狂的宣傳，使輿論贊成新戰爭的發生。戰爭投機份子以揑造的蘇聯準備進攻美國之消息，刺激人民，以為其本身　戰的藉口。蘇聯對於任何國家固無絲毫的攻擊威脅，而若干國家尤其是美國，則已自戰爭的心理狀態，進入採取軍事戰略性切實措施之階段，包括建立新軍事根據地，重編軍隊，擴大軍備生產，改進作戰武器等。維氏於此并質問大戰結束旣已兩年有餘，何以英美聯合參謀部尙保留於華盛頓。</p>
<p>維辛斯基然後提出決議案，內稱，聯合國機構嚴重譴責若干國家，尤其是美土希等國反動份子發動之犯罪性的新戰爭宣傳，經由報章電影及公開演說，散佈各種暗示之議論，聯合國機構認為需要促請各國政府禁止任何形式的戰爭宣傳，違者施以刑事處罰，并由各國政府採取防止危害和平國家利益及幸福之危險的戰爭宣傳。</p>
<h3>蘇何不以身作則　先撤退北韓駐軍</h3>
<p>聯合國韓觀察員表示</p>
<p>〔合眾社　魯辛十八日電〕韓出席聯大觀察員殷　易女士，批評維辛斯基之演講稱，在世界史上自希特勒之傑作外，極難發現一嚴正之外交　令充滿如　矛盾。維氏竭力要求外國軍隊自非敵國撤退，當然渠專指美國在中國及其他地方之駐軍，而非指蘇聯在北韓之駐軍，如維氏所稱，此項軍隊之撤退有助於增進國際信心及建造和平，則蘇聯何不率先為天下　，自北韓撤退。韓人一致認為混合委會已失敗，在所謂解放後二年中，韓國處境之惡劣為其歷史上所未有，故馬歇爾提議韓國問題列入議程之努力極為正當。</p>
<p>〔新亞社漢城十九日電〕美國務　馬歇爾　議將朝鮮問題提交聯合國討論之後，此　各政黨及社團均極為重視。韓民主黨宣傳部長對此發表談話稱，「民主黨絕對支持馬歇爾氏之主張，并希望聯合國予以圓滿解決。」</p>
<h3>對蘇代表演說　各方觀感</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十九日電〕今日據悉：蘇聯代表維辛斯基昨在聯合國大會發表長達八千言之演說，猛烈抨擊美國「戰爭商人」後美國務卿馬歇爾已　受美代表團其他要員之　　，將不顧蘇聯之堅決反對，繼續進行力謀設立和平機構。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十八日電〕各國代表對維辛斯基演說觀感不一。少數認為「有聲有色」，多數認為「嚴厲」，亦有視為純粹「宣傳」者．但維氏保證蘇聯無意發動戰爭一點，則為各方所重視．英首席代表麥克尼爾稱，「此乃有趣之演說，但大部份引證與責難，均為老生常談．法代表巴洛迪稱，「此乃最嚴厲之演說，此乃非常重要之會議」。美國會方面最初之反　出自眾　員　　，據稱，此種演說極盡　　之能事。敘利亞代表戈呈稱此演說為「打雷」，據稱，「最重要之　乃蘇聯保證無　發動戰爭。」</p>
<h3>希副揆飛美</h3>
<p>〔路透社雅典十九日電〕希臘副總理兼外相蔡爾達理斯，定明日飛紐約出席聯大，新任不管部長自由黨　梅拉斯同行。</p>
<h3>蘇注視聯大發展　莫洛托夫謁見史達林</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科十八日電〕莫洛托夫外長日前赴黑海區，晤見史達林總理，現巳返抵此間。各　外交家一數　予重視，認為莫氏正在密切注意聯合國大會種種發展。某外交官相信，本屆聯大會議對於世界機構之前途不無危險。蘇聯認否決權為促成五大國意見一致之工具，如欲加以廢止，必將引起危險。蘇聯對此問題非常重視，本屆會議如認真打擊否決權，蘇聯亦必強力反擊。</p>
<h3>澳加等代表抨擊　濫用否決權</h3>
<p>澳力主提　訂德日和約</p>
<p>〔中央社弗魯辛草地十八日電〕澳加南非三國今俱在大會一般評論中，發表演說，抨擊否決權之濫用，并支持美國所提成立大會臨時委會之建議，要求大會能獲更大之力量，　為威脅安全及和平之國際紐紛最後仲裁者。澳外長伊伐特直率反對否決權，并熱忱擁護大會，　　於安理會。伊氏要求迅速締訂對德　日和約。華首席代表羅　落稱，全球人士必須在聯合會及目前形式之否決權中，抉擇其一，若否決　之運用并無適當規定，則吾人或將兩者俱失。羅氏復熱烈支持馬歇爾建議，并擁護美國之決定以朝鮮問題列入大會　　。</p>
<h3>巴勒斯坦特委會　定週一選舉委員</h3>
<p>〔路透社弗洛辛十八日電〕專門審查巴勒斯坦問題之聯大特別委員會，定星期一選舉委員，瑞典外長翁　，可望　　為主席。</p>
<h3>美蘇攤牌　不可避免</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十九日電〕披蘇聯代表維辛斯基在聯大會中指斥為「戰爭製造者」之一之眾院外委會主席伊登，　　維氏攻擊之後，向全國廣播樂樂：「　蘇聯之攤牌為不可避免之事。」伊　顯然不為維辛斯基之譴責所動，敦促美人，明白表示美國已決定防衛其自由，并「盡力協助其他人民」，維護彼等之自由。伊氏稱，「吾人　於三點理由，　　蘇聯攤牌。（一）世界在兩種水火不相容之人生哲學，擇取其一之　要　為迫切。（二）蘇聯具有一進取之意識，其公開之目的，為以世界革命征服世界，其動機至為　鄙，且不近人情，　如一隻餓虎。（三）共產主義痴心妄想，以為美國自由政府之方式及自由資本主義企業一日不減，蘇聯方式必吿失敗。遲早吾人必將　共產主義化身主義之蘇聯正面敵視，且將一查是否兩者可能并存於現代世界上。」伊氏又稱，「美國決定不吝代價，維持其現下在聯合國之領導地位，此地位將　　為吾人外交政策之基石。」</p>
<h3>美國建議如獲通過　蘇可能退出聯合國</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十日電〕出席聯合國大會之代表，今日已在鄭重討論蘇聯退出聯合國機構之可能性，若干代表相信聯大會如果通過美國建議之設立五十五國和平與安全委會之案，則蘇聯之奶出聯合國極有可能。同時據權威方面息，美代表團已準備於聯大三分之二多數之會員通過該案後，即不顧蘇聯之參加與否，逕行執行該一新馬歇爾計劃。美國報紙對於馬歇爾之靳計劃熱烈　護，一致要求聯大不顧蘇聯之威脅，迅速通過此案。若干小國之代表團計及蘇聯退出聯合國之可能性時，在未獲本國政府訓令前，尙不敢就此案有所表示。</p>
<h3>今後戰艦大砲　將由火箭代替　英國海軍年鑑預測</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十八日電〕海軍　　　　「　　戰艦」一九四六—一九四七年版已於昨日出版，其中預　今後一二年內最新式戰鬥艦上主要武器即十六吋口徑大砲之地位，將由火箭代替，英國兩國已　入改　　　應付原子彈之新時代。美國　　四　五千噸之戰鬥艦「肯脫　」號與載重二萬七千五百噸之戰鬥巡洋艦「夏威夷」號建造工程　時停頓，殆因擬將火箭添入配備所致。</p>
<h3>印政府否認歧視回教徒</h3>
<p>〔路透社　　　十九日電〕自巴　　坦出席聯大代表麥克漢表示，印度政府茍不採取步驟以制止　殺回教徒之行為，巴基斯坦或當向聯合國機構申訴後，印度政府特於今日發表聲明，表示準備由任何公正當局，裁決巴基斯坦對印度之指責。聲明內復否認克漢所稱印度政府無從履行其職責等　，并稱印度政府從未煽動任何一族以　力對付暴力。印度出席　大代表潘迪德夫人亦向報界發表聲明，　對歧視　施再歧視，決非和平之　。有云印度不願回教徒在其境內，絕對不確，印度自治領境內，尙有回教居民三千萬，印政府無意使其遷移。印政府之目的，在　移民工作，僅以本哲布一　為限。</p>
<h3>畑俊六受審</h3>
<p>檢察官　改起訴　狀</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十九日電〕東京國際軍事法庭十九日開始審訊畑　六，其罪狀要點為：（一）曾為中國派　　司令官行侵略戰爭；（二）任　　時期會計劃準備侵略戰爭；（三）為打倒米內閣之首謀者之一。畑之　　人在答辯時稱：畑　　　對侵略戰爭，并對宇坦大　之　　，從中協力，并　畑在米內內　　　　，係　　　。受命　理此事件之檢察官司　　，竟削除起訴　之大部份，僅受　其中之一部份。按畑俊六為中國人民最熟之日本戰犯，彼在中國派遣軍司令官時代之為非作惡，及縱容日軍之殘暴行為，實屬罪無可恕。</p>
<h3>越南政局轉微妙　交趾支那突又發生政潮</h3>
<p>〔路透社西貢十八日電〕西貢之交趾支那議會，今日通過對該國總統李文　之不信任案，使　市政局益趨　　。交趾支那議案之決議案，并各業越督波拉　　　此一爭執。按交趾支那共和國成立迄今，巳有十八個月，國內若干黨派　成維持現狀，然另有一部份黨派，則指　文　政府為不受人信任之傀儡政府。同時據法方消息，安　　王保大之允諾與法國談判，使越南戰事有早日解決之希　，法方人士雖指出保大宣言中所稱者　越南之「獨立」而法方建議者為「自治」，其間尙有距離，但相信此項距離必能消滅。巴黎方面今盼望保大正式與法接洽談判，法當局或當再度發表聲明，鼓勵越人擁護保大。</p>
<h3>日水災嚴重　東京市民撤退</h3>
<p>無家可歸者達二十萬人</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京十九日電〕社會福利部今日宣佈，東京市北區又有日人五萬名開始撤退，同時，美第一　兵師偵察結果，此間　團　東平原上日人無家可歸者計約二十萬名。防堤遭水侵蝕，漸見損壞，兼以潮浪回擊，本市將有被襲之　。本州北部第十一空運師美兵約三百五十人乘坐火車，中途遭遇洪水，曾困守歷四晝夜，如處孤島，現已返抵師部，安然無恙。</p>
<h3>美兵強姦日幼女</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京十九日電〕憲兵司令部今日宣佈，日本十四　少女　　，十七日晚五時在此間郊區某公園被美兵強奸奸污，傷　嚴重，旋經日本　察發覺，報告美第八軍司令部，當派憲兵逮捕兇犯，現正進行盤詰中。</p>
<h3>盟總官員　前倨後恭</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京十九日電〕值茲訂立對日和約日期漸近之際，盟總高級官員對日政府官員之態度，顯巳逐漸「和緩」。佔領日本後一年半來，盟　與日政府官員間，始終維持極為正式而拘束性之關係，刻正逐漸轉變。美日兩國代表　之關係，現已演進至趨向自然之階段，已多少居於平等之立場。此種墨跡之明確象徵，可於本年五月麥帥與日皇裕仁會晤時談話之態度中見之。據記者從權威方面獲悉，於前此之二次會晤中，麥帥均以「你」稱呼日皇，但以後之會晤中，麥帥則始終以「閣下」稱呼裕仁。美對日態度由嚴峻趨向緩和，係始於五月三日新憲法生效後，行憲後數日，曾有數日本政府高級官員往訪盟總要員，晤談畢後，盟總官員竟破例送別，直至大門，日官員受寵若驚。</p>
<h3>印尼軍大舉反攻　美同意參加三國委員會　閣定下週發表印尼政策聲明</h3>
<p>〔合眾社巴達維亞十九日電〕共和國公報十八日晚稱：共和國軍之有力部隊自東爪哇山上之根據地出擊，向瑪瑯西北二十哩之山區大舉反攻，荷印度方在重霧中激戰九十分鐘，荷軍死六十人，傷二十人，同時雙方在爪哇中部曾接觸五次，在西爪哇發生三次。</p>
<p>〔中央社弗魯辛十八日電〕此間今宣佈，美國將為安理會處理印尼問題之　停委員會之第三會員國，出席聯合國大會之比澳兩國政府前曾共同請求　國政府作為調停委員會之第三會員國，美國旣表示同意，故調停委員會乃最後決定為澳比美三國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社蘇門答臘把東十九日電〕聯合國領事調查團英法澳三　代表昨日已飛赴布　廷吉實地調查荷印雙方執行停戰令情形，是為荷印戰事發生以來，歐洲人士訪問該地之第一次。各代表原擬乘坐吉普車啓程，旋因公路阻　　　設地雷，遂改乘澳洲空軍　科他式專機起飛。</p>
<p>〔路透社海牙十九日電〕荷蘭內閣昨召開特別會議兩小時半，　自美國歸來之范　克總督亦參加。荷閣定下週二發表印尼政策之聲明。</p>
<h3>英頒緊急法令　強迫國民就業</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦十八日電〕政府今夜根據緊急經濟權力，頒佈法令，強迫一部份工人接受違返其意志之主要工作。法令規定男子在十八歲至三十歲間，女子在十八歲至四十歲間概須向勞工部申請工作，否則將科罰金一百鎊并處徒刑三個月。有職業工人與保育十五歲以下孩童之婦女不在此例。</p>
<h3>蘇再度致牒伊朗　促速批準兩國石油協定</h3>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭十八日電〕可靠方面息：蘇聯業已第二次照會伊朗，嚴辭要求伊朗國會，對蘇伊共同開採伊朗石油事，採取迅速行動，不得從事拖延。該項照會係由蘇駐伊大使沙基柯夫於九月十五日向伊政府提出，係用以答覆伊朗對蘇聯第一次照會所提出之覆牒者。伊朗該次覆牒，拒絕蘇聯要求伊朗與蘇簽訂新石油協定，不待伊國會之批準。伊朗國會目前尙無意即時通過對蘇爾丹納政府之信任票，而蘇氏不　此一信任票，即無從請國會批準去年簽訂之蘇伊石油協定。</p>
<h3>明年一年　緬甸獨立　美緬同意互派大使</h3>
<p>〔合眾社倫敦十八日電〕英國緬甸事務部大臣李斯任威爾今日　　稱：緬甸將於一九四八年一月成為「完全之獨立共和國」。緬甸制憲會議則將完成其「緬甸聯邦」之新憲法，屆時英國將與緬　政府簽訂簽約，并將於十月廿日召開英國國會時，即　出「緬甸獨立法案」，希望能於耶　前完成獨立法案之立法程序，俾緬甸至明年一月可以慶祝其獨立。</p>
<p>余近至緬考察，條約條件已在原則上商獲協議，英政府已任命現任駐埃公使　格為駐　高級專員，以後鮑格將任英首任駐緬大使。緬甸與印度情形不同，并無自治領地位之過渡時期，移交政權及通過獨立法案後，緬甸即可成為「獨立自主國」。</p>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓十八日電〕美國務院宣稱：美國與緬甸兩國業已同意兩國外交使節升格為大使階級。緬甸第一任駐美大使將由宇　巴出任，一般預料漢德兩將被任為美駐　第一任大使。</p>

<p>兵役協會宣傳委員會，昨日下午三時假市參議會，招待報界對志願兵征集情形，有所報吿。民政處長張曉崧及上海師管區參謀主任高寳書等亦列席。該會主任委員方治稱：志願兵開始征集，時僅數日，各區報到人數，平均每日均在一百二十餘人左右，其中頗多不合條件，堅請應征，及將安家費捐辦敎育者甚多，令人萬分感動。各區民衆歡送志願兵之情緒，尤見熱烈，本市應征三千名，由此相信月底即可如數征足，萬一不足，則依法抽籤征集。當茲總動員期間，凡屬愛國人民，均應本「有錢出錢，有力出力」之旨，踴躍　將或應征。中央委員宋子文捐獻中國建設銀公司投資事業之全部股份，各方　應捐獻者，將接踵而至，聞孔祥　氏公子孔令侃及其他股實者，即將有類似行動，可為楷模，此誠為極好之現象。</p>
<h3>購油問題迄未解決　中航可能被迫停飛　公司業務會議今起討論提案</h3>
<p>中國航空公司為積極改善業務起見，特於十九日至廿一日，在滬召集該公司所有高級職員，及滬·京·平·漢·穗·渝·靑·潘·厦·港以及加爾各答等十一個重要辦事處處長，舉行業務會議。十九日爲各部主管人員及各辦事處處長之工作報吿，廿日起開始討論業務提案。</p>
<p>據該公司總經理劉敬宜語記者稱：中國公司目前最難解決者，厥爲汽油問題，中國中央二公司汽油，均仰給於滬上英美兩國之油公司，因此均須憑美匯購買，政府給予中國公司之官價表匯僅五十萬美金，此五十萬元美匯，雖經政院批准指定作爲該公司給付外員薪金及添購飛機零件之用，其他需用之美匯，准由輸入管委會以官價酌量撥給。惟至今輸入管委會未有具體復示。中國公司在美匯短絀與不准結購黑市美匯變重難關之下，用油問題，已面臨絕大困難。如在此數日內，仍無解決辦法，則中國公司可能於本月二十五日起暫時停航。劉氏繼稱：即使購得黑市美匯，公司方面因入不敷出，亦將無法維持，否則祗有漲價。然飛機運費上漲，對整個物價，均有關係，際此金融不穩定之今日，中國公司實不願因空運漲價而刺激物價。刻中國公司仍繼續與負責當局洽商，期於最短時內解決此一重大問題。</p>
<h3>斜暉慘淡低奏輓歌白璐安葬虹僑公墓</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕名電影演員白璐，前在國際飯店墮梯殞命，遺櫬於昨日午後卜葬虹橋公墓。白璐生前親友事前特於中國殯儀館舉行公祭，由田漢主祭，洪深，熊佛西，羅明佑，夏雲瑚，白楊，王人美等陪祭。祭禮中鳳子報吿白璐生平事蹟甚詳，田漢及洪深並先後致悼詞。嗣由金燄，劉環，史東山，沈浮，鳳子，潘孑晨等扶櫬移虹橋公墓，在斜暉慘淡，輓歌低奏中覆土，此一靑年藝人，遂從此與世永別。</p>
<p>白璐遣雛安美及小美二人，此次本擬由港來滬臨穴一視，惟迄昨猶未趕到。白夫蔣君超昨危立壙前，良久不願離去，鮮花數束，黃土一坯，蓋已使彼無限神傷矣。</p>
<h3>田賦折合價劇增十餘倍　田局長為農民請命原則已獲中樞接受</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕財政局長田永謙，爲請求中央減低本年度之田賦率，於十六日夜車晋京，業於昨日公畢返滬。據悉：中央原則上已予接受，本年度田賦之開徵，尙須候糧食部之正式公文。若依照中樞之規定，本年度之田賦徵實標準爲每畝三斗四升五合，（內包括徵價一斗五升，徵實一斗五升，公糧四升五合）。較之去年之每畝徵一斗九升六合增加頗多。又本市非產區，無法徵實，根據中央之規定，須以開微前三個月之榖價平均數，爲折合國幣之標準，若依此標準計算，本市本年度田賦折合價，約較去年增加十三倍至十五倍，則農民必無法負擔，故田局長特親自赴京，爲太市之農民請命。經與糧食部田賦署長張導民接洽後，原則已獲同意，惟尙須待呈糧食部作最後決定。</p>

<h3>金條有線索可尋　牽涉無名少女　吧女在馬萊處曾見照片</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕英人卻利阿卻被控槍殺余盛孝一案，地院咋晨九時繼續審訊該案證人。朱育瑛推事偕檢察官丁同峻升座後，首傳汽軍所有人派屈洛夫，據供稱：有自備汽車一輛出租與卻利相識已有兩年，卻利常來租車，平時均有司機跟去，時間一小時至三小時不等。八月一日用車時間最久，是日下午卻利來租，說有女友同遊，不用司機，當時講好八萬元一個鑛點。還車時渠付給支票一張，票面八十萬元，連同鑰匙一同交給我，叫我將多餘之款，明日兌現還他。此時見卻利後尚有一人，身材較為矮小，未帶帽，衣白親衫，西裝上身掛在肩上，質料為嘰墜，似係夏服。倆人走入匯中飯店，嗣卻利命我駕車將此人送至百老匯大廈，再送卻利回家。彼兩人在車中談話聲普低沉，內容不明。車停百老匯大廈後，我代為開門，略加注意，此人似現慌張，下車時祗聞「明天見」．嗣又駕車送卻利回家。</p>
<p>車主證詞　異於卻利</p>
<p>至此，庭上因渠之供詞與前日卻利供詞有盾之處，即轉向卻利詰問：「還車時是你一個人去的﹂？卻利先說：「是一個人去的」。繼又說：「是馬萊開車的」。并供：「車錢是先付，支票一張，票面八十萬元。當時不要司機，并未說與女友同遊」。旋傳訊卻利之妻娜脫麗亞，供稱，「結婚已有三年，因受刺激過深，心緒不住，不願答話。以前曾有一書面報告　庭，請以此作為根據﹂。庭上命翻譯官將伊過去口供繙成俄語，并示以前次在美軍法庭筆錄，伊均點首表示承認。嗣傳新麗珠酒排間老闊弗藺京葉那洛維夫，供稱，美國人，五十歲。馬萊常至酒排間，八月一日上午約十時，馬萊與卻利同來，馬并將卻利向我介紹。下午三時馬萊復來，卻利在外等候。</p>
<p>擬將金條　兌換美鈔</p>
<p>繼傳運輪行戰員　增年之妻胡　文，供詞月一日下干六時許，卻利偕同其他一人來我家找謝，說有一根金條要兌換美鈔，當時答覆不做此生意，介紹渠至成都車行按洽。復傳我縫店老關胡根惠訊問，供稱，余盛孝是日在店中避雨，提及金條交易之事，并云此生意如做成功，可賺二百萬元。訊至此已十一時三刻。庭論退庭。下午二時起繼續傳訊成都車行賬房王子榮，證明卻利曾持謝名片來訪。成都車行經理吳鐘英則稱，適外出，情形不知。被害人余盛孝妻樂氏稱：八月一日是余對我說，有一美國人官做得很大，要買金條。九時半出去後，即未見回來。</p>
<p>馬來準備結婚　需要一千美金</p>
<p>末傳勃雪龍濟吧問煙女侍高美英供稱八月一日十時許，馬萊至勃雪龍酒排間吃酒，嗣領我到百老匯大廈，並給我看兩張小姑娘照片，云準備結婚，惟需一千美元，借無此款。我對他說少喝點酒，積蓄一點錢即可。馬聞此言聳聳肩膀，無所表示。翌日早晨九時送我返家，晚八時又來雪勃龍吃酒，並給我美金二十元。未幾馬外出，十時許復來，照片上之兩小姑娘亦同來。詰之卻利，稱不識高美英，惟馬萊曾對我說有一朋友可代換美鈔，大概係指雪勃龍酒排問女侍而言。至此，辯論律師唐懷　要求庭上下次設法傳照片上兩小姑娘到庭訊問，或許能查獲金條下落。訊至此，已下午四時許，庭綸本案十日後再行審理。同案美籍犯人馬萊由院方電外交部請其設法向美軍交涉於下次開庭時出庭作證。</p>

<h3>向大潮挑戰！　搶修南沙坍江</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十七日訊〕錢塘江有世界著名的大海潮，中外人士每年到海寗去看「錢江潮」的眞是人山人海。現在，廢　七月的「鬼潮」已通，八月的「桂花潮」即將排山倒海地來了；旅行社和好遊人士早已在準備着去看一看這一年一度的大潮。但是天不作美，潮流改向，海寗造江漲起沙土，錢塘江的水流都集中到南岸去了。首當其衝的是　山縣的南沙但是南沙的居民沒有　情去看這白浪滔滔的大海潮，因爲海潮比淪陷時候的日本人還兇，它一下子就會吞噬了他們底生命，財產和土地，錢塘江的潮水是地下活動的，它以巨大的力量，從江岸衝入地層，把泥土掏空了，於於轟然一聲，數十畝的田地一下子就坍下去，冲散在澎湃奔騰的海潮中，連逃跑也來不及。因此，南沙的農民拆屋搬家，已和戰時逃難一樣，成爲很平常的事，但他們的心情　比戰時的難民更凄苦。他們和一百多年前移民到南沙去的他們底　先正相反；他們底祖先是和十五，六世紀歐洲到美洲去的移民一樣，懷着欣喜和希望到新世界去；而他們則是帶着頹喪和失望的心情被海水趕回來，所以有好些從來沒有洗過限淚的男子漢，也都要臨江痛哭了。</p>
<p>江水侵蝕　頭蓬鎭</p>
<p>錢塘江流的改向，在抗戰初期即已開始，不過，那時的北岸漲沙，南岸坍江，是潛移默化的，不太明顯。在南沙，最初是捲去了無人關心的沙灘，坍去了不能所植的生地，逐漸侵蝕到農田，那時大局不寗，亦無人注意；到勝利後，已吞沒了深入七八里的田地。直到今年春潮以後坍江愈烈，江水已侵蝕到近江第一個大鎭——頭蓬，居民岌岌可危，地方上惶恐地騒動起來，請願呀，呼籲救濟呀，呌得鎭天價響，但見塘工局以責在保塘，正全力修理北岸海寗一帶去年彼冲坍的海塘，南沙在南岸海塘外二，三十里，無力顧及，應由地方當局自行搶修，塘工局僅能派技術人員協助，後經再三要求，先後撥了四百噸麵粉；可是地方上自己答應可集資五六億的工款，始終籌不着錢，搶修江作等於不做。頭蓬鎭也遭殃了，大批的房屋給海水吞去。於是南沙問題更嚴重起來，七月中旬，沈主席趕往視察災區後，決定，工程處改組，由塘工局接管；名義上仍與地方合辦，但先由塘工局墊款進行搶修。八月一日，新的工程處成立，塘工局特派董專員督導搶修在經費短絀，運輸工具缺乏，材料短少的艱難條件下，董專員全力搶修。最初擬照保塘最有效的築盤頭法，在頭蓬鎭首尾江岸及頭蓬以東江岸分築三個丁字　，但是試騐結果，失敗了；潮水太兇，江岸仍被冲坍，盤頭變成離陸的小島了。因此只好用最基本　辦法，直接用石保岸。但是經費和石料的缺乏，工程祗能在最險要的地方築了四十公尺。因此在沒有工程的地方，仍要坍江，但頭蓬的坍江，已日見好轉，居民額手相慶，不再拆屋搬家了。</p>
<p>怒　　岸　巨石飛</p>
<p>廢曆七月三日那天，潮水洶湧，前所未見，怒　擊岸，白浪冲天，高達四五丈！沉在水裏保岸的，要五六人才搬得動的巨石，被潮水冲上岸竟遠至百餘尺！有的巨石被挾往江心，有的帶到上流去了，留下來的，約僅一二成。居民看見巨石會飛，大勢不可救，所以又爭相拆屋搬家了。但工程處還要盡力和水搏鬥一塲，他們已化一億餘元買來木料，預備做木　裝石沉入水底打基礎，再做竹籠裝石保岸，籠與　用鉛絲連起來，可免被水冲上岸或挾帶去了。留下的問題祗是如何對付潮水的「地下活動」。董專員說：「現在集中冲到南沙來的潮水，正和一百五六十年前冲到海寗去的一樣，那時乾隆皇帝大量動用國庫，全力築成堅固的魚鱗塘，條石塘，外加坦水，始保了海寗；現在南沙一無防備，全部經費僅足造一丈條石塘，所以正如大刀隊抵禦現代化的機械部隊，那裏抵擋得了？頭蓬至今已坍去四分之一，勢成半島，洶湧潮尙有一月，命運決於斯矣！我們的工程，祗能說盡盡心而已。」（記者黃行天）</p>

<h3>錢塘江流趨中泓　不救南沙救大局</h3>
<p>目前南沙的工程是最危急，最艱難的，而北岸漲沙，海塘可確保無處，塘工局爲什麽不以全力去救南沙呢？很多人都這樣批評，但是塘工局從大局着想，看法完全兩樣。副局長汪胡楨說；說種水流變向，就錢塘江本身說是一種好現象。江流趨於中泓，冲刷河床，加深水道，極有利於錢江通航，正符合於塘工局理想的治江計劃。戰時受尖山至馬牧巷漲沙影響，而分成南北二路的出口水流，因此也可合而爲一。自尖山至翁家埠之猪頭角，沿江一片漲沙，廣達廿萬畝，與岸壤接，故海塘確保。南沙雖坍，大槪至蜀山，新灣底一綫即可稍止；坍江廿萬畝，較確保杭·嘉·湖·松·蘇·常·太七郡之安全，視其得失，則南沙之損失實不足道。明淸以前，錢江出口有三，一爲今道，一爲蜀山赭山間之中小門，一爲赭山　山間之南山門。目前趨勢，漸歸古道，則自明淸以來七郡大水災之隱憂可以消除了。</p>
<p>就自然趨勢和經濟條件而論，要保南沙，已是力所不及，而且也非必要。如其耗費人力物力無濟於大局的搶修，實不如把工款去救濟災民。頭蓬一鎭靠江長達一千餘公尺，而工程僅四千餘公尺；七月初三的海潮，已不甚見效，何况眼前還有將來的洶湧的「桂花潮」呢？南沙在坍下去；頭蓬已成爲半島，工程處還在用盡力量和水搏鬥，但是等着他們的或不免是一個陰暗的命運。（行天）</p>

<h3>滬台之間</h3>
<p>〔本報十九日訊〕三十小時的海程或三小時半的空中飛行，使台灣與上海內陸的距離，愈縮愈短。滬台綫的正常交通，帮助了內陸興海島文化，生活，全般的融洽和交洗。但距離僅管在縮短，時間似乎還沒有許可帮助解除多重的隔膜。</p>
<p>台幣激起裂痕</p>
<p>台灣唯一特殊之點，就是台幣。台幣實際上用以穩定該省的物價，使海島筑起一道防波堤。但在目前，這條防波堤已被內外汹湧的浪潮激起裂痕，島內的工業產品不能源源出口，而補充的原料和機械器村，却仍急需進口。過去仰賴於台糖公司二百億法幣頭寸作爲匯兌的週轉，台糖是否願以官價七十二元折合台幣，却成爲問題。於是省府一再尋求通匯的正常出路而不可得。循至台北市塲台幣黑市價格最低達五十二。</p>
<p>物價超過上海</p>
<p>這情形苦了從京滬綫去的一二洗的淘金者，相反地却慫恿了一般單帮客，他們可以一張船票匯出百萬元法幣，償付川資外尙有餘，這種掙錢的旅行結果，使上海人看到了台灣土產，也使台胞看到物價高漲的指數表。</p>
<p>說台灣物價低，這若不是錯覺，就是過去的話。從上海去的或是從灣台到上海的，都會感到海島的物價高，用台幣折合一算，却還超過上海。在台灣掙不到大錢，商業上說，沒有大胃口，可是消耗起來却並不困難。省府管制和調節物資的機構，因為人事上的交易，現在還在忙於再接收；多少人正存着無限的熱望。</p>
<p>保持生活傳統</p>
<p>躭在台島較久的都不願再躭下去，可是上海正有許多人在向台灣作進攻態勢。海島有它的優越之處，但也正有其缺點，「淘金」的政府固不歡迎，而民衆也並不樂意。台胞需要保持和賡續一種簡單淳樸認眞刻苦的生活傳統，可惜現在一天天被破壞了，冲淡了。</p>
<p>新兵基地以外</p>
<p>軍事上，台灣可能作爲訓練新兵的基地，而似乎更適宜作爲一個海島公園。旣成的建設使給　單調的景色增添現代美，天時地利，使海島另有一個風可，在這裏，二週間的遊覧日程，堪以獲得奇趣。</p>
<p>有幾種人是可以謳歌的，實地苦幹的技術工作者，學術研究者，廉潔奉公的行政人員等…。他們在狹隘，單調，寂寞的處境中，我求工作和事業的安慰，這是安定給他們的生活力。（特派員江暮雲）</p>

<h3>日小學敎員自白揭穿日敎育黑幕</h3>
<p>學校敎育仍向軍國主義的道路前進</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十二日航訊〕此間朝日新聞「讀者之聲」欄，刋載宮城縣小學敎員二木杏平之投書，題爲「敎育界之民主化？」內稱：「去年起舉行敎員資格審查，但始終都只是一種形式而已，宮城縣內敎員九千人之中，審查不及格者不過十人，現在仍然保存着戰時的學校行政姿態，文部省官僚並不加以任何之批判檢討，學校敎育仍然遵循着軍國主義的道路在前進。戰時在文部內任地方視學官的人們，戰後雖有一部份仍繼續任職，但大部份都轉出到各縣去任校長事。我們對於這樣形式的民主化，堅絕反對。再者，在人事行政方面，從來即不重視考試出身的。雖有幾十年的敎學經騐，有很卓越的敎育技術，亦難望被擢昇爲校長。在今年三月間的人事調動時，就曾引起一般敎員的憤慨。現在不將這種不平與差別待遇打破，是永遠無從希望敎育民主化的實現的。」就此一段投書中，不僅可以說明日本至今敎育行政，絲毫未曾民主化，即其他一般政治經濟之民主化情形，亦可以此類推。此一小學敎員之自白，絕非無病之吟，在今日盟國討論對日和約之際，此項事實頗應注意。</p>

<p>昨日棉紗市况，行情由平轉挺，最後四二支藍鳳紗高至一千九百三十萬元，比上日續升二十萬。</p>
<p>棉布初開微挺，旋以經監員到塲抽查，人心轉軟，全日趨勢以精元細布，及深色白貓花布，銷路不惡，市呈挺秀。籠頭細布結果比上日步升一萬二千元。</p>
<p>中紡配紗價格過高</p>
<p>據警局經濟科查悉，日來紗市價格波動，主因爲中紡公司配紗，價格隨黑市而提高，且有黑市已跌而配價未跌，故有超出黑市之事，使平價工作進行大感困難，深望該公司能予注意云。</p>
<p>中國紡建公司昨日循例分甲乙兩組售紗，甲組售紗六九四件，申購單二六八張。乙組售紗一二一五件，申購單九六五張。</p>
<p>無證入塲七人被拘</p>
<p>警局經濟整察大隊紗布組，昨續派員監視棉布市場，查獲徐耀章，包子培，章成釗，王羲善，遲至善，任松茂，陳學儀等七名無證入塲，拘留三天示儆。又查獲過期入塲證七十九紙，已由警局飭棉布業公會負責人，限於廿六日以前，補辦入塲證手續，並予驚吿。</p>
<h3>棉市淸稀</h3>
<p>昨”現棉交易淸稀，紗廠因銀根緊急，更以紗價疲軟，勢成觀望，同業銀根有緊有鬆，交易做開不多，一部份成交者大都欠款交易，至間因有拆息關係，故價格明平暗降各檔成交七四〇包。</p>
<h3>統債平庸外股盤局</h3>
<p>公債昨稍回落，惟形勢尙見平庸。統丙晨開一二四〇〇元，三六〇室五五五室賣出，盤低至一一六〇〇元，五〇三室五五〇室稍納，微升至一二〇〇〇元收市。結果較前收計甲乙回降二百元，統丙跌落五百元，統丁微挫一百元，統戊則低四百元，成交仍祗五百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨盤旋不定，過程則疲後漸穩。怡紗晨開九二八〇〇元，即吿盤升，午後曾微升至九四七〇〇元，而後稍平。廣帮及洋行帮雖納，證券帮及散戶均賣，成交仍少。午後更稀，結果較前收計英聯會德豐業廣航業鋼業電話小挫，怡　低落半成，怡紗紙業尙平。</p>
<h3>人造絲激漲</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市瘋在上漲，一二〇號金三馬高山等開盤二千五百三十萬元，各方搜購甚殷，迄中午高至七百萬元。下午漲勢更猛烈，新高價層出不窮，但買氣不餒，卒造成最後新紀錄價九百萬元。東洋九百五十萬元，比上日竟漲起三百五十萬元之鉅，實因存底枯竭，實銷頻繁，雖中信局按期配售，尙不能饜足消耗之數，以致行情日吿上揚。</p>
<p>廠絲</p>
<p>昨市漲勢亦厲，各級喊價比上日俱高一百五十萬元至二百萬元之譜，尤以D級E級去胃較好，存現日枯，行情更俏。昨BC等級喊價四千萬元，D級九百五十萬元，中級另担自六百五十萬至八百萬元幾檔。干經開口普通另担喊價二千六百萬元，廿八分五担頭在八百萬元左右。</p>
<h3>發展南洋貿易　應有緩急先後之分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據經濟專家高事恒之分析，因南洋爲一農業社會，工業品均賴國外輸入，主要者有棉紗，布疋，棉織品，機械，五金電器，食品等六類，一九三八年各邦之輸入共達美金三億三千萬元以上。我國對南洋之貿易，戰前以越南及東印度爲多，輸入部門我國自越南輸入米較多，自婆羅洲及巨港，則輸入大量石汕，故對東印度之貿易額，頗有增加。我國輸出南洋之貨物，可分成輕工業品及土產品兩大類，前者首推紗布及棉織品。五金及日用品中，電泡電扇玻璃器具文具，我國均有地位，化學品及雜糧亦有銷路。就輸出及貿易數字言，一九四〇年比一九三八年已大有進步，惜因太平洋戰起而中止。今後我國對南洋貿易，應有緩急先後之安排。以全局言，我國應以全力爭取東印度市塲，因該區人口最多，當力最强，如能　起該區市塲，問題已解決一半。次之為馬來亞，出產之橡膠與錫，仍能維持世界市塲，而新加坡又爲其樞紐。暹羅待債務償淸後，即恢復經濟自由，貿易亦有希望。越南緬甸與我通商之展望，「前尙難斷言。</p>
<h3>人心懈怠如故　華股猶無起色</h3>
<p>華股昨塲外恐怖繼續存在，交貨者更湧，中途再現跌風，但慘跌之後，空方有納，情形漸形平定，熱股升降俱微，雜牌較爲遜色，水泥新亞會吿跌停。</p>
<p>晨初</p>
<p>人心尙形平定，開出時升降俱微，永紗開後，亨鼠及錢兌業等仍來套賣，自即交二二二元，遞交二三〇元起，逐漸獲低。惟遞永紗在二二〇元內外，曾費掙扎，終以餘怖未泯，交貨者多，塲外息價仍站二角二分半及二角七高價，即交中套賣，源源不斷。</p>
<p>十時半後，迫低至即交二一〇元，遞交二一七元低價，而後始有抵補者。水泥由二二五號急售至停板限度，後經一三七號維特而稍回。新亞由一九一號賣到跌停，但永紗陣脚轉定，形勢徘徊，成交不多。延至十一時三刻後，紗花帮納胃稍殷，午收升至二一六元及二二四元。熱門股雖跌而不多，遞景福且吿小升，僅遞信和跌半成爲最多，雜股則跌落較多，新亞跌停，水泥跌停後微回。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>塲外先行喊高，遞永紗登塲小秀，開後因聞夜報載有繼續援華之報告而復疲。現永紗低至二一八元，遞永紗則止於二二三元。嗣後雖有國行交換差出，但漲勢不能持久，終以盤局結東。結果較前收計即交股永紗新光中法新華景　商務中紡榮豐閘北小挫，信和華豐景福微升，美亞中絲火柴麗安尙平，泥內衣動興跌半成，水泥新亞跌停後有回，軋低半成强。遞交股計永紗信和新光微挫，華豐平平，美亞景福微挫。塲外各老股除大生再挫少許外，餘尙平定。</p>
<h3>麵粉評價會議　定下週一舉行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市社會局為謀使麵粉價格合理化起見，決擬參照廠商實際成本，恢復麵粉議價制度。第一次麵粉評價會議，已定於下週一上午十時，在社會局舉行。出席機關，將包括市參議會，市商會，第四區麵粉工業公會，本市麵粉商業公會，雜糧業公會，中信局，及物資配　顧問委員會。</p>
<p>又訊：麵粉配價照常，惟多數均爲雜牌廠粉，去化活絡，形居挺秀二雜牌略見挺升，統粉亦然堅倘。麩皮客銷轉呆，回疲千元。</p>

<h3>七十五年來世界文壇鳥瞰</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>編者要我寫這樣的題目，字數限定二千以內，這實在是個難題，但因我是本刋世界文壇近况的特約編撰，對於這樣的題目，實在難於辭謝，只好隨便說一個大概。</p>
<p>申報創刋於一八七二年，這很凑巧，可說是接近新浪漫主義開始的年代。通常研究文藝思潮的人多說自然主義的時期是一八三〇年到一八七〇年，那未以一八七一年作爲新浪漫主義的開始或醞釀，六約沒有什麼不適當吧？</p>
<p>新浪漫主議</p>
<p>新浪漫主義（Neo-Romanticism）與浪漫主義的不同，簡單說來，在於前者是通過了自然主義的浪漫主義，也就是受過科學洗禮的浪漫主義，後者則僅只是空想的浪漫主義。也就是說，浪漫主義似乎在我們人所住的世界以外，玄想一個幻想的境界，或如雲雀之翱翔天空，或做着中古時代騎士的夢；但新浪漫主義却是想建造人間的樂園，所有的神秘和象徵都是通過了現實的。</p>
<p>新浪漫主義包括下列各種主義：頹廢派，象徵主義，唯美主義，神秘主義，享樂主義，其實都是可以歸在一起的的。</p>
<p>頹廢派（Decndant）起於法國，時爲，一八八二年，一羣年文學者聚在巴黎拉丁街一個咖啡店的一問地下室裏放歌縱酒，這便是頹廢派文藝的開始。這個團體，起初不過是符號，完全沒有意義，後來名詩人莫里亞斯（Morias）加入，纔把名稱改爲頹廢派，意思是借用法國文明史對於羅馬文明衰落時期的人的稱謂。這一派除莫里亞斯外，還有孟代（Meends），波特萊爾（Baudelaire），范爾倫（Veraine），馬拉梅（Mallarme），休士孟（Huysman），藍嚴（Regnier等，又稱爲象徵主義。</p>
<p>這一派傳到英國，便是唯美主義（Aestheticism），如史文朋（Swinburne），王爾德（Wilde）都是這派的大將。王爾德穿着奇裝異服，手持百合花招搖過市是一件有名的事。</p>
<p>神秘主義（Mysticism）的大家可舉比利時的梅特林克（Maeterlinck）和威爾哈倫（Verhaeren）。他們常愛採用神秘的題材，其實也不過是眞理的象徵罷了。梅特林克的童話劇「靑鳥」，用靑鳥來象徵幸福是衆所周知的。</p>
<p>新理想主義</p>
<p>在廚川白村的名著「近代文學十講」和本間久雄的「歐洲近代文藝思潮論」裏都還只敍到新浪漫主義。張夢麟（筆名憶秋生）的「歐洲最近文藝思潮」末章只題作「改造期之文藝思潮」，但德國的表現主義（Expressionism）也放在裏面了。最後也敍到新理想主義（Neo-Idealism）。但黃　華的「近代文學思潮」和吳雲的「近代文學」却都逕直用新理想主義這一總名來包括所有二十世紀的文藝（如人道主義等），但這些已經都是一九二八年以前的舊著作了。</p>
<p>所謂新理想主義，如名稱所示，它有一個理想，也就是有一種主張，人道主義這名稱是更明顯的。它與自然主義不同的地方，即在於自然主義只是暴露社會的黑暗，並不曾指示一條光明的路；只說出病狀，却不曾開一張藥方。但新理想主義却明白地昭示我們應該怎樣做。托爾斯泰（L.Tolstoi）和羅曼羅蘭（R.Rolland）是這主義的兩顆巨星。托爾斯泰的「藝新論」竭力攻擎頹麼的象微派，羅曼羅蘭的「約翰·克利斯多夫」（傳雷譯）已成了我國靑年的熱烈愛好。</p>
<p>表現主義以戲劇爲多，從人類愛出發，德國作家反對本國的好戰。這類的戲劇又可稱爲「絕呌劇」，全都是些熱烈的呌喊，因此他們不能寫小說。詳見劉大杰的「表現主議的文學」和「德國文學概論」。代表作家有愷石（Kaiser），溫魯（Unruh），托勒（Toller），威甫爾（Werfel）等。以上四位除溫魯尙存外，均已逝世。愷石和威甫爾都死於一九四五年，托勒死於一九三九年。</p>
<p>成瀨淸的「現代世界文學小史」和千葉　雄的「現代世界文學大綱」想把一九一四年開始的第一次世界大戰作爲一個新的界限，但似乎都不能簡單地歸納爲一個統系。成瀨淸說：「不論哪一時代的文壇，都有許多眉，互相反撥，結合，交錯，像目前文壇這樣複雜紛亂的情形，是從來所未有的。」例如，構寫性心理的英國羅蘭斯（D.H.Lawrence）和朱士（James　Joyce）就有無從歸類之感。</p>
<p>新現實主義</p>
<p>最近十餘年來的文學，依以羣的「文學的基礎知識」，稱之爲新現實主義（Neo-Realism）實際就是新理想主義的延長。如著重於這第二次的世界大戰，則不妨稱之爲民主主義，（Democraticism）這是我杜撰的名稱，我覺得這一次大戰是民主陣營與法西陣營的鬥爭，終於法西的德日意帝國主義倒下來了，民主國家獲得了勝利。迎德國進步的作家也都大多數逃亡在外，反對本國的措施。詳見拙譯「最近的德意志文學」刋「文藝春秋」五卷三期。「文藝復興」五月號有五篇長文介紹英美德法蘇五國最近的文藝動向。</p>
<p>蘇聯的現代文學可看「蘇聯文學之路」和「戰後蘇聯文學之路」二書，（均時代書報出版社版）。英國現代文學我買到一本海華德（John　Hayward）的「一九三九年以來的散文文學」（Prose　Literature　Since　1939，可惜史般道（Stephen　Spender）的「一九三九年以後的詩歌」和李德（H.Reed）的「一九三九年以後的小銳」未能買到。「一九三九年以來的戲劇」尙無撰述人。這四本書都是收在「不列顚的藝術」叢書裏的，其他尙有建築，舞蹈，電影，繪畫，音樂等，蘇格蘭和威爾斯的藝術也另有專書。美國的我買到一本劉毓松（L.Lewisohn）的「美國文學的故事」，直叙到最近爲止。法國的我介紹徐仲年的「法國文學的主要思潮」，除首篇外，全都講的是現代法國文學，商務　、</p>
<p>最後，我介紹一部最重要的英文書，那就是史密斯（Horatio　Smith）所編的「哥倫比亞近代歐洲文學辭典」（ColumbiaDictionary　of　Modern　Europcan　Literature），每條均請各國文學專家負責簽名撰寫，共八九九面，細字雙行，共請二三七位敎授執筆，任何小國的文學如Albania,Catalonia,土耳其，烏克蘭等國都有概况的叙述，實是値得一看的書。</p>
<p>本日因篇幅限制，尙有徐蔚南：「七十五來的上海文獻」，兪劍華：「七十五年來的國畫」等多篇，容陸續刋登。「一寸山河一寸血」暫停一日，併此聲明。（編者）</p>
<h3>七五獻辭</h3>
<p>有人偶然問起「春秋」，說是『「春秋」，卷秋多高？』我會想這樣回答：若說「春秋」是可以代表本報副刊之一的話，本報自創刊之日，徵求騷人韻土的詩歌竹枝詞之類，即作爲初期的副刊形式說，那也才過古稀晋五；在人生雖算高壽之齡，在一種事業上看，才只辦了一世紀的四分之三，資歷還淺咧。若從「自由談」辛表創刊起算，不過三十六歲，更是年輕。至若單就「春秋」論春秋，民二十一創刊，到今天才祗十有五年，正當豆　年華，更是幼小了。</p>
<p>個人也常這樣想，假如「自由談」作爲本報的長子，那麼，「春秋」只是一位小妹妹。</p>
<p>所以　，也就因爲是小妹妹，年幼識淺，稚氣未脫，常不免吟風弄月，交接騷人韻士，喜歡咬文嚼字；這也可以說是七十五年書香門第，家風如此。然而她並沒有忘記了『春耕夏耘，秋收冬藏』的耕耘收穫；她眞誠坦白而純潔，她以「春秋」二字象徵着她追求眞善美的精神，也正如孔子當年以「春秋」來正名定分的道理一樣。她相信，只要普遍的將人們的眞善美的精神發揚起來，亂臣賊子自會消滅於無形。——自然這種思想，在這時代也有幾分不合時宜。可是她不管。</p>
<p>又有人說，全國報紙副刊旣創始於申報，則申報副刊追溯淵源，應爲全國報紙副刊之嚆矢，那麼，報紙爲什麼有副刊？副刊的定義是什麼？是的，副刊的產生也正如報紙的產生，自有它的緣由。所以不妨趁今天試擬一條定義：</p>
<p>凡新聞紙上文藝的，專門學術的，以及一切知識的趣味的文字，爲適應時代潮流及讀者需要，闢有固定版面刊載者，謂之副刊。</p>
<p>副刊地位，依照新聞事業的發展情形，可以說已經與正刊（時評與新聞版面）並重。它的作用與價値：（一）配合報紙時評與新聞，（二）介紹思想學術與知識技能，（三）調劑並增加讀者興趣，（五）供給讀者發表文字並交換意見。</p>
<p>至於副刊編者，就副刊而言，猶如保姆；對於讀者猶如廚司，也有人說是園丁。其實保姆也好，廚司也好，園丁也好，說來說去，總是一個僕役。不過照民主國家的習慣，自大總統以下的政府官史，都可自稱公僕，這樣說來，副刊編者又何幸如之！——其實事實上並不一定是這麼回事。</p>
<p>今當本報創刊七十五週年，發行二萬五千號的紀念令辰，編者不能無辭，因就所興所知，略談副刊大意，藉以就正於本刊歷屆主編，撰稿作家暨愛護本刊的讀者，並視康樂無疆！（進珊）</p>

<h3>春秋憶舊錄</h3>
<p>— 瘦</p>
<p>好快啊！本報問世以來，已經過了七十五度春秋，要是以人爲喩，那麼他已是一位七十五歲年高德劭的老先生了。筆者以民國八年進館，僥倖地做了他老人家三十年的老夥伴；在這七十五年一部漫長的生命史中，、自己也不知不覺消磨了一大半的歲月，他老人家果然盤根錯節地渡過了一重重的難關，而筆者摩　淚眼，也已飽閱了滄桑。可是自太平洋大戰爆發以至勝利以後，筆者在館中就沒有參加過實際的工作，正如紅樓夢大觀園裏的妙玉一般，是個檻外人了；然而無論如何，檻外人還是在大觀園的牆圈子裏，當然憂樂與共，痛癢相　，想當初冒過了驚　駭浪，好容易重見　月光風，這已是一件可慶可賀的事；何况他老人家老當益壯，重振家聲，不但沒一些兒龍鍾衰頹之　，反而返老爲童，充滿着蓬蓬勃勃的朝氣，那麼我們做老夥伴的，又怎麼不要歡欣鼓舞地來慶祝他七秩晋五的壽辰呢？</p>
<p>春狄編者王進珊兄，因筆者是春秋的手創，敦囑叙述一些當年創刊的經過，這又恰似天寳宮人說開元遺事，未免感慨萬千了。筆者本已編了十餘年的自由談，總算兢兢業業地應付過去；到得民二十一年秋間，故總理史公量才因要給讀者換換口味，特請黎烈文先生來相助爲理，去微集些新作家的文章，而仍命筆者負審閱編輯之責；自己本來是個好好先生，甚麼都無可無不可的，當下奉命唯謹；可是不上幾時，來稿往往並不經我過目，就自管自的發排，弄得我尸位素餐，無所事事，於是不得不知難而退，向史公表示了讓賢之意。多承史公念舊情殷，堅留不放，說：「自由談旣已變了質，不妨再來一個副刋，由你獨張一軍，努力幹去吧。」筆者感激之餘，就使出了一股士爲知己者死的傻氣，忙着招兵買馬，決計好好地幹一下；終於在民二十二年一月創刋了春秋，而春秋這個名稱，也是和史公屢經商討而決定了的。</p>
<p>筆者編輯副刋，一向取折衷態度，凡所釆用的文稿，新的一派固然歡迎，舊的一派也並不歧視，總以有意義有趣味爲主旨，對於格式的排列，圖書的點綴，也力求其美化，所以創刋伊始，關於文字方面，特約程瞻　先生作「瞻廬隨筆」，汪仲賢先生作「上海閒話」，目己也作了一種「紫羅蘭　談薈」，輪流地刋在報頭下，處於第一篇的地位；中央排上一篇短篇小說，那是孫了紅先生的「疚心」，底下一排關一專欄，分「新發明」，「小常識」，「游於藝」，「小園藝」，「小小說」，「人物小誌」，「風土小誌」，「世界珍聞」，「遊踪所至」，「兒童的樂園」，「婦女的樂園」，「笑的總動員」等十二種，每天刋載一種，村料似乎已很充實了。一面便又特約了名畫師方雪鴣先生，擔任圖畫上的設計，報頭畫橫的豎的，時時變換，每一篇文字的上面，還得配上一個小巧的圖案，便是專欄和小說等的題頭，也都是照着含義特地畫起來的；因此從表面上看去，自有一種花團錦簇之致。後來短篇小說用膩了，就特約張恨水先生作長篇不說，先後有「東北四連長」「小西夭」「換巢鶯鳳」（此作因八一三戰起未刋完）諸作，秦瘦鷗先生也譯了一部德菱女士的「御香縹　錄」，在　時都是　　人口的。到得專　用　了，便又專選　小精悍之作若干篇，編成小春秋一欄，彷彿一頭袋鼠的袋子裏，懷着小袋鼠一樣，怪好玩的！筆者在這裏還得提一筆，這幾年之間實在得到黃寄萍兄的助力不少；至今我們還保持着一份溫暖的友情，歷久不變。</p>
<p>史公對於副刊似乎時別注意，所以那時筆者常被召喚，商討一切；他曾笑着對筆者說：「你不要小覤了道小小報屁股，它對於整個報紙的銷數，却是很有關係的。』筆者在他老人家常　督促之下、不敢不黽勉從事，如今距史公遇難去世之日，也忽忽十餘年了，追憶遺言，爲之论痛！</p>

<p>自由談　七十五週年紀念特刊</p>
<h3>卅六年來的「自由談」</h3>
<p>— ·征凡·</p>
<p>屈指算來，「自由談」已有着整整三十六年的歷史了。在中國報壇上，一張報紙能够站穩脚跟達幾十個年頭的，已是不能多見；而報紙的副刊能够隨着報紙的成長，站穩脚跟達幾十個年頭的，更是鳳毛麟角。有之，也只有「自由談」而已。</p>
<p>我們不能說三十六年是一段怎樣長的時間，但是這三十六年中，在國內局勢上，正是中國歷史上最重大的改變時期，中國人民，經歷了辛亥革命，從滿清的壓迫下解放出來，經歷了北伐，從軍閥的壓迫下蘇醒過來，又經歷了八年抗戰，從帝國主義的壓迫下抬起頭來。——包括了整個的中華民國歷史。同時，在中國的報壇上，這三十六年也正是中國近代報業從形成到充實的一段時期。</p>
<p>而「自由談」正在這三十六年中成長而茁壯起來，在隨便那一期「自由談」中，儘可以嗅到那個時代的氣息。這三十六年中，「自由談」也算得歷經滄桑了：曾經是禮拜六派的談情說愛之所，也曾經是新文學家的盤腸大戰之地，刊載的文字，從琴棋書畫至歐風美雨，從游戲筆墨到修養小品，幾乎無所不包。但是，儘管風格與內容，隨着時代的演變，而一再演變，而原則只有一個，始終不變——那就是始終是名副其實的「自由談」，自由自在的談，沒有偏見，沒有拘束！</p>
<p>「自由談」，不僅是中國壽命最長久的副刊，也是中國最早出現的副刊。</p>
<p>我們這裏敘述「自由談」的歷史，便不能不提起中國報紙副刊的起源。報紙上刊載一些詩文小品，原是由來已久，大抵附在新聞后面。一九〇〇年出版的同文滬報，隨報附送「同文消閑錄」一種，完全是小報的風格，並不是大報的副刊形式。但是正式的副刊的成立，却以「自由談」爲最早。</p>
<p>清末宣統三年農歷七月初一日，（公元一九一一年八月二十四日）申報當局以「世事日進，人事日繁，」宣佈改革編輯方針，兼顧嚴肅及活潑，自由談便在這天和讀者相見。最初，由王鈍根主編，所刊載的多爲游戲文字，如「海外奇談」「豈有此理」「博君一粲」之類，也刊些詩詞以及迥文體，疊字詩等，每天並連載長篇翻譯小說。當時對象爲社會一般士大夫階級及工商界人士，內容只限於茶餘酒後的消遣文字而已。</p>
<p>民國四年三月十八日起，由吳覺迷担任編務，編輯方針仍如前，曾經一度徵求軍人詩文，以激發國民尙武精神。</p>
<p>如此一年光景，姚鹓雛繼任「自由談」編務，（民國五年四月一日），對「自由談」內容稍有改變，偏重舊文藝，刊載南社詩文最多，一時幾成爲南社同人發表詩文的獨有園地。此外，又闢了「自由談之自由談」的小園地。</p>
<p>姚鹓雛編了整整六個月，在同年十月卅一日起，由天虛我生（陳栩園）接編，當時除刊載小品散文外，還發表些「家庭常識」之類的文字，使這副刊，不但使讀者欣賞其文字，同時給予讀者以實益，當時頗受讀者歡迎。</p>
<p>天虛我生除經營文墨生涯外，原也致力於民族企業，民國七年之後，天虛我生已成爲實業家，於是虛便由陳冷血（即本報發行人陳景韓先生）主編。冷血先生的道德文章，素爲世人所欽仰，他的犀利有力的短評在中國報壇上早已有口皆碑。這時的「自由談」，便着重於短小精悍的短論，切中時弊，深爲讀者所愛讀。（上）</p>

<h3>編者獻辭</h3>
<p>欣逢本報七十五週年，站在一個編者的立塲，不能不說幾句話。</p>
<p>「自由談」曾有過燦爛光輝的歷史，愈因爲它曾經有過輝煌的里程，愈使編者感覺責任的艱鉅。</p>
<p>每天，當你坐在桌子的前面，你接觸到各種各色的讀者，向你控訴社會的黑暗，向你責備生活的清苦，向你呼號豪門的貪污，在字裏行間，有時候，你可以看見他們的淚光，有時候，你可以呼吸到他們的憤怒與反感。</p>
<p>經過八年抗戰，一切還在走上復員的道路，許多離亂的情形，自然在所不免。一切令人不能滿意的情形，我們可以很肯定的說，一定會慢慢地改好的，腐朽的必定會死去，新生的也必定會成長。新陳代謝——這是歷史必然的發展。夏蟬「蛻變」期中，母體自然感覺痛苦萬分。</p>
<p>中國人民，現在就處在這一個方生未死的狀態中，我們應該瞻望前程，在碧野萬里金霞滿天的天空底下，她自有着美好的景色。</p>
<p>頹喪·消沉，這是一個可恥的名辭。活得愈艱苦的人，愈會體念生活的意義。</p>
<p>「自由談」創刊到現在，已有卅六年零一個月，在這漫長的歲月裏，你可以看見它包含着多少戰鬥的意味。</p>
<p>「自由談」今後的重心，仍想配合新聞性，加強科學，知識的介紹。賢明的讀者·作者，望能給我們更大的協助。</p>
<p>過去幾個月中，編者應感謝許多作者，抽出寶貴的時間，爲本刊寫作，我們自應由衷地表示最髙度的謝意！</p>

<h3>人熟禮不熟</h3>
<p>— ·未壯·</p>
<p>西諺有句話，意思是：「習見的東西，未免會輕視」。我們天天所看的報紙，在日常生活中，好像一個極親密的朋友，因爲看慣了和熟習了，也就不當他一會事。甚之由於親呢的關係，不知不覺間，反會養成狎弄的習慣了。</p>
<p>常有人說，報紙的論調，總是些老生常談，不痛不癢；報紙的紀事，免不掉人云亦云，千篇一律。這些意見和批評，在一般讀者說來，原也未可厚非。不過，平心而論，報紙好像是社會上一部紀錄的機器，又像一面鏡子，他所產生的和反映出來的，脫離不掉社會上的現實環境。有安定的社會，才會有理想的報紙。蕪雜的羊毛織不出美麗的地氈，不能專怪報紙的不長進。</p>
<p>申報誕生於七十五年前的今日，拿人的一生來比例，七十五年已經超過古稀之年，不可謂非壽徵。國內不必談，即以世界上現在的著名日刊來說，在西曆一八七二年間的同輩，恐只有美國的“Bosten　Globe”「波士頓地球」（德國的“Berliner　Tageblett”也創刊於前清同治十一年，現在未知還存在否）一報了。即以物稀爲貴的原則來說，也値得我們重視了罷！</p>
<p>在過去半世紀非科學的中國，申報能塊然無恙，生長到現在，不可謂非我國文化史上，和學術界中的一個奇蹟。中國有幾個著名的大學，像申報一樣年久？沒有。中國有那一個學術研究機關，擁有與申報一樣的歷史？也沒有……在過去動盪不安定的七十五年中，申報能以細水長流的姿態，自强不息的精神，歷盡艱苦，掙扎圖存，爲社會服務，爲人民喉舌，形成了公同社會（Gemeinschaft）心的交通機關中的領袖。申報自稱「資格最老」，誠可當之無愧，而我們予以相當的尊敬，亦屬理所當然。</p>
<p>以中國幅員之遼闊，人口之眾多，即有十個以至百個申報亦不爲多。可是眼前的事實並非如此。社會對於報紙應該多加愛護，自不待言。而於後起的所謂新的報紙，又宜善爲培植，使中國報業的基礎，格外鞏固，格外深長。</p>
<p>俗語說：「人熟禮不熟」，申報雖是我們十年或幾十年天天見面的老友，際此七五大慶，我們在早上見到他的時候，似乎還得心裏表示些敬意罷。</p>
<p>最髙領袖昭示我們要敬老愛小，願讀者善體斯旨！</p>
<h3>申報老人回憶瑣記</h3>
<p>— ·退伍老卒·</p>
<p>申報「老人」，今年七十五歲了，本月二十日，正是她的大誕，本報同仁，都替她奉觴上壽，至足娛也。</p>
<p>但是這個「老人」，原來是個美僑，生長在上海，至光緒三十年時（？）始入中國籍，方算是中國人了，所以「老人」七十五歲，固當紀念，我認爲她歸入國籍那年，尤應該紀念，蓋老人完全算爲中國人，僅四十又五六年也。</p>
<p>申報原爲美商美查公司所創辦，是一張美國的華文報紙，華經理爲席君子美，子美死，乃由其弟子佩繼任。至光緒三十年，該公司無意經營申報，乃由席君子佩接辦。於是申報始脫離美籍，而正式入我國版圖矣。</p>
<p>子佩收買申報後，欲大事整頓，乃請金君劍花爲總主筆，張君繼齊，家兄蘊和及余爲主筆，其餘如孫玉笙，雷君曜等，均爲該報舊人。任翻譯之職者，爲顏君俊卿（？），顏君跛一足，額有槍痕，手持司鐵克，及暮方至，茶役即端一椅於書桌傍，並以士林·文蔚等西報進，顏君口　雪茄，展報口譯電文五六條，或六七條不等，任筆述之職者，大抵雷君君曜爲多，時間不過半小時許，而待遇獨優。其時八股時代，英文頗爲名貴也。惜顏君同事不久，即去，繼之爲陸君達權，後爲嚴君詒庭。</p>
<p>申報地址，原在三馬路江西路東首，今市政府各局辦事處，即所謂紅教堂對面也。排字房與編輯部均在樓上，中間隔一公衖，隔窗繫一蔴繩，繩端繫馬口鐵罐一，發排稿件，均置此中抽送，校樣亦如之。其時重要新聞，不過公門抄及各省大吏奏摺而已，其餘如「地方新聞」亦甚少，或竟甲收乙用。至於「本埠新聞」，盜竊火燒等事，已爲極好之材料，惟每日論文，規定千二百字，不能過多，亦不能過少，每日排好版子，方進晚膳，與近日必須清晨四五時方完工作者，奚帝霄壤矣。</p>
<p>其時余醉心英文，對於記者生涯，未感興趣，担任撰著僅年許，適兩江總督魏光廉，在寗開辦髙等學堂，乃辭報館職務，考入該校，未既家兄亦因赴日考察教育，脫離申報；及歸，適志贊熈先生，創辦南方報於四馬路江西路口，邀余等担任編輯職務，贊熈珍妃兄也，因珍妃失愛於西太後，墮井而死，贊熈避居滬上，創辦是報，不料爲登載振貝子對名女伶楊潔喜事，慶親王勃然大怒，電兩江總督端方，勒令停閉，時慶親王爲軍機大臣，兼總理各國事務大臣，甚爲西太後所倚畀，無法反抗，南方報不得不於是時壽終正寢矣。</p>
<p>其時申報已遷至望平街，原爲又一邨番菜館地址，總主筆爲孫君東吳，館中編輯正感乏人，聞南方停辦，即與席君子佩堅要余往，余以志君尙擬組織新報，約余不得他就，余因礙於情面，未之許也。席孫二君，强之再三，余始應允，惟約回家休息兩月，再來服務，一藉以休息，二瞻志君之動靜也。余返家後，適徐錫麟刺殺安徽巡撫恩銘事發生，而志君重行組織之說，一時未能實現，余於是第二度重入申報矣。而家兄蘊和，亦於次年重入申報，時申報編輯之組織，尙極簡陋，編輯既少，校對一人，兼司剪輯新聞職務，故往往編輯·校對都由一手任之。余對於記者任務，此時爲最勤奮矣。不料宣統三年，余怔冲病發，離館休養，年餘未愈，方始離職。</p>
<p>至民九又入申報，此爲第三次入申報矣。此時之申報館，即今之所在地。股東而兼經理，爲史量才先生。於民元受盤於席君子佩者也。余入申報一次，即搬遷一次，余入申報一次，亦即發達一次，時代巨輪之推進，誠無終止之時期也。</p>
<p>附註：余頗健忘，此中年月有不能記清楚者，或名字有錯誤者，惟大抵總不甚相遠耳。</p>

<h3>白勉並勉本報同人</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>新聞事業在中國的歷史，雖然還不滿百年，而本報却首佔了七十五年二萬五千號的篇幅。本報在促進中國現代化這一個工作上，不容自謙，確曾盡了一部分的大責任。辛亥革命和北伐前後，報人以滿腔革命的然誠，發動與論，推翻專制，掃滌軍閥。到抗戰開始以後，新聞界人士更在淪陷區和大後方流血流汗，艱苦奮鬥，擁護政府長期抗戰的決策。近兩年來，則全國報人都在爲戰後國家統一建設的目標而努力。總之，在每一時機到來時，新聞記者都曾站在最前面，不畏縮，不游移，盡了他最大的責任。今當本報紀念之日，略述個人對於新聞事業之所感，所以自勉，亦所以勉本報同人。</p>
<p>新聞記者是一種極繁重，極艱苦的職業。但是近年來新聞事業的進步和從業人員的迅速增加，顯示了對於這個工作發生興趣和信心的人已經日益增多。這是爲什麼呢？因爲大家已經潸出了：。新聞事業是一種有意義，有價値的工作，對於國家和人類文明的前途有着極大的關係。人生的意義，本是在求能爲多數人服務，使多數人得益，有如一個火炬，點燃自己生命的光輝，爲千百在黑暗中行走的人們照亮前途。我們要達到這個目標，新聞事業可以說是最理想的工作了。因爲新聞記者的一個字，一句話，可能影響到數十萬甚至數百萬的諸者，而產生極大的力量。</p>
<p>正因爲如此，我們作新聞記者的人，就更加要審愼警惕。如果我們報導了一個錯誤的消息，或是發表了一種錯誤的見解，試想它對於社會，將發生怎樣不良的後果。所以我們新聞記者，所負的不但是一種職業上的責任，而且還有一重道德的責任，社會的責任。作新聞記者的人，決不能只憑自己一人的好惡，或是逞一時的意氣；我們任何一言一字，都應該考慮到它對社會所負的使命和可能發生的影響，時時顧及到整個的環境。我們應該指引人民以正確的道路，多多報導建設性的新聞，使他們能够時時看到前面光明的遠景，而鼓舞起整個社會的向上之力。必如此，新聞記者才能够眞正担負起正確輿論的責任，</p>
<p>要達到這個目標，不是一件很容易的事情。這需要有學識，有修養，有經騐，有勇氣。所以我常常覺得，新聞記者的資格雖然迄無明確規定，但是要做一個良好的新聞記者，却較從事任何其他職業爲更難。現在全國各地都已有新聞記者公會的　織，但究竟要怎麼樣的資格，才可担任新聞記者，却從無法律上的明文規定。其他自由職業，如醫師，律師，會計師，其資格都有嚴格的規定，敎育界則無論大學敎授，講師，中小學敎員，都須經過核定或檢定。只有新聞記者，從無規定。在這種情形下，希望我們新聞記者都能珍重自己這個神聖的職位。我們旣不能在明定的資格上來證明自己配作一個新聞記者，就必須在工作的事實表現上來證明自己配作一個新聞記者。我們對於自己的任何一言一行，都當時時檢討反省，建立自已在社會上良好的聲譽，獲得他們的信心。那時，才可能發揮出新聞記者在社會上的領導作用。新聞記者必須先自我尊重，才能得到他人的尊重。</p>
<p>上面說過，作一個新聞從業員，是一件很不容易的事情，他需要有學識經騐，同時並須有高度的服務精神和勇氣。在新聞技術“益進步，新聞競爭日益劇烈的今日，一個良好的記者，我覺得至少應該具備下列四個字的條件。</p>
<p>第一個字是：「真」。新聞的先決條件是眞實。新聞如果離開眞實，就不過導是謠言。不眞實的新聞，無論是有意或無意的，都是不可原諒的。我們採訪到的任何消息，必須竭盡所能，設法制斷這個消息是不是眞實的。這一種判斷，有時依靠其他新聞來源的證實，有時憑自己對於這一件事情的了解和觀察，有時須恃目己對於某問題的學識和經騐，來和所得到的消息比較印證，以決定其眞實性。總之，我們必須以儘快的時間，作儘週密的判斷，務使只有眞而富於價値的消息才出現在報紙上。須知一個不眞實的消息，或由此而發生的不眞實的見解和批評，就報紙本身說，將影響到自己新聞報導的聲譽，予人以不良的印象。就對外的影響說，小而言之，害及一人一事或某一團體的名譽，使人雖或更正而已洗刷不淸；大而言之，甚至或引起社會上的騷動不安，影響整個國家的安霧，竟或促致國際間的猜忌與糾紛，亦非不可能。由此，我們可以知道，新聞的眞實性是如何重要了。新聞記者應有追求眞理的信心和熟誠；新聞應求其「眞」，確是作一個良好記者的第一個條件。</p>
<p>第二個字是：「迅」。由於無綫電和無綫電傳眞的發明，近代通訊技術的進步一日千里。新聞最主要的是它的時間性，所以迅速也是一個新間記者的必備條件。近代報紙的競爭非常劇烈，所以記者得到眞確的新聞以後，必須以最迅速的方法電話，電報，或無綫電通知報館。這次世界大戰結束前，盟軍登陸諾曼第，和波過淡茵河時，各　軍記者都曾用盡方法，想把這個消息比其他人早三五分鐘送達自己的報館，立即播出，以爭取時間。但我們這裏所說的「迅」字，必須先有了第一個「眞」字，方有價値。因爲惟有眞實的消息才値得我們迅速報導；否則，我們如果爲了想快，而把未經斷爲眞實的消息貿然拍發出去，給果發現其不可靠，又發電取消或更正，不但是物質上極大的浪費，而且是信用上的大損失。如或已經登出，來不及更正，則豈不更將引起不良的後果？所以這「迅」字，必須與「眞」字相輔而行，方有價値；「迅速翔實」，二者缺一不可。如何以最短的時間，設法證實新聞的眞實性，而後以最快的方法，將其發出，這是一個新聞記者所當時切注意研究的問題。</p>
<p>第三個字是：「愼一。這在担任編輯工作的人，尤當注意。上面說過，報紙的影響旣如此之大，我們決定一件新聞的刋登與否時，就不應只考慮自己報紙本身的有利與否，而尤當顧及到這件新聞刊載以後，對於團體，社會，或國家所可能蒙受的影響。有時明明知道這件新聞是眞實的，也是迅速的，但爲整個社會和國家着想，恐怕它會發生不良的後果，而寗願割愛不登。報紙是一種社會的事業，負有社會文化的重大使命，所以我們決不能像一般商業性的公司那樣，只要有利可圖，就把貨物賣出再說，對於顧客的是否可能吃虧，從不聞問。我們報紙，對於社會的影響旣如此之大，自己的責任旣如此之重，對於所發表的任何新聞，亦當審愼衡其利害，權其輕重，以定去取。作一個編輯的人，在這種地方必須具有極淸楚的判別力。</p>
<p>第四個字是：「勤」。勤本是任何事成功的必要條件，不過一個新聞記者所具備的「勤」字，必須包括三個方面，那就是；勤於工作，勤於學習，勤於檢討。所謂勤於工作，就是說他對於本身的職務，必須以最大的努力使它能達到預期的成果，使報館這個有機性的每個部分，皆能臻於理想之境。所謂勤於學習，就是說一個新聞記者必須在工作上不忘進修，使自己永遠不會落伍。世界思想知識科學的發展與進步很快的，如果我們不時時勤於學習，而只枯守着自己的一點工作，則結果，我們必將感覺與時代脫節，落在時代的後面。僅知工作而不知學習，決不能長久成爲一個好的新聞記者。所以新聞記者必須抱着「日日新·又日新」的精神，時時和世界的思潮和文化知識保持密切的接觸，在工作中學習，並且以學習輔佐工作。最後，說到勤於檢討，也是很重要的。一方面，我們要時時檢討自身的工作，是否尙有可以改進之處；一方面，我們亦當檢討自己報紙的優點和缺點，和別的報紙作一稱比較。而且我們還應竭力歡迎一般讀者對我們報紙的檢討。人家所有的新聞，我們爲什麼沒有？是不是忽略而未會採訪？還是感覺其不宜發表或不値得發表，所以自動刪去？人家有些什麼優點，什麼缺點？我們必須了解人家的優點，才能看出自己的缺點，而設法補救；也必須看出人家的缺點，才能了解自己的優點，而加以保特發揚。這一種對自身工作和整個報紙的檢討工作，是一個良好的新聞記者所必須做的。</p>
<p>一個新聞記者，如果他能了解自己使命的神聖，責任的重大，同時並在工作上努力做到這「眞」，「迅」，「愼」，「勤」四個字的條件，那末，我想他一定能成爲一個理想的新聞記者，一定能够在他的工作本位上，爭取事業的光明和國家的强盛。茲値本報七十五週年的紀念節日，特誌此數語，以與本報同人共勉之。</p>
<h3>老申報</h3>
<p>新聞是當代的史料，凡後世人欲知某事發生的經過，某人的重要事業，報紙均有詳細的紀載。惟報紙上所刊登的新聞，隨時發生，依次紀錄，前後貫通，若有中斷，必致殘缺不全。是故收藏報紙期刊，貴在持久，毋使中斷。</p>
<p>申報創刊迄今，已歷七十五年，此時正逢中國的劇變，外患相繼而來，在政局上，經戊戌政變，辛亥革命，以及北伐，才奠定民主政治之基礎。復經過二次世界戰爭，在第二次戰爭中，我國單獨與日寇週旋八年之久，半壁河山，失而復得。在經濟上：輪船，火車等西洋物質文明，流入古老的中國，改變了中國的生產方式。社會制度，亦形成混亂的狀况，傳統的舊禮敎已爲靑年所摒棄，而新道德還不建立起來。所以一切的一切，都顯示突變的姿態。</p>
<p>要考查中國近數十年國內外的政局，及社會，經濟，文物典制度，報紙是最好的材料。本報以歷史較久，而紀之事較多，且偏重於文化方面，更爲近代史家所注意。所以七十五年來的申報全份，不僅爲本館自身發展的紀錄，且爲我國以及世界近代之重要文獻。現今本報資料室中所藏七十五年之老申報，實爲本報最大的財產，一種無價之寳。</p>
<p>現今能將七十五年來的申報，全份保存完好無缺者，據筆者所知，得兩份。一份是本報所藏，一份是在徐家匯廠書樓。搜藏是一種興趣，要興趣維持得長久，不是易事。至若個人一生未能畢事，而子孫能繼承先人之志，更是非易。且七十五年中，變亂頻仍，民生不安，難以使收藏不散。圖書館是公共事業，可以作長期之搜藏，惟本報創刊時，正値中國近代文化的萌芽期，圖書館旣不多，且亦不知收藏報紙，徐匯書樓之一份，確是不可多得的。</p>
<p>不僅他人不知保存這近代文獻的申報全璧，就是本報自己也沒有好好地保存。因爲當初美查創刊申報之時，究全以營業爲目的，並不把他當作很珍貴的文獻，也許也想不到申報會有這樣長久的歷史，會能成爲中國報壇的耆宿。所以當初祗問賺錢，祇顧出版，而不知保存。這實在是一件可笑的事。</p>
<p>現在我們所收　的申報，能完壁不缺，是張仲照先生的厚意助成的。張老先生是申報的老友，從申報出版以後，張先生必每天購閱，閱後又珍藏之。自遜淸同治十一年起，迄辛亥爲止，四十年間從未間斷。本報由史量才先生接辦後，以自己出版之報紙，而自己未能保存，引爲一大憾事，乃登報公開徵求全份，張老先生即出四十年之收藏，舉而歸之本報。張老先生之　慨熱忱，本報當，永誌不忘，而對於近代文物保存之功，更不可磨滅焉。</p>
<h3>小啟</h3>
<p>欣逢館慶，今日本報特增出三張半，輯此紀念特刋，重荷黨國元勛，各界碩彥，寵錫鴻文或惠賜題字，高情雲誼，曷勝感銘，茲以篇幅所限，致不及編入，在此除深表數意外，併申無限謝忱。</p>
<h3>申報二萬五千號感言</h3>
<p>— 史詠賡</p>
<p>申報誕世忽忽遂已七十五年。以人生爲比擬，借吾齡而有餘。自惟涉歷不深，難溯久遠；即憑省識，亦多管茫。値茲紀念之良辰徒覺低回而不盡。責以抒述，如環無端，姑就鄙懷，略貢一二。</p>
<p>以整個申報言，可區劃爲兩時期：先嚴量才公接辦之前爲一時期，先公經營以後爲一時期。先一時期之概况，吾不得而知已，就吾體味之所及，祗以光公爲依據。先公自謂，砥碼一生，從事報業，故不惜爍神耗慮以赴之，殫思竭精以將之。擘畫之未盡，則飲食有難甘，檢討之偶遺，亦申旦而不寐。當時爲先公任有力之輔助者，陳景韓張蘊和二先生尙矣。陳先生以其無偏無倚之態度，持正論於勿替，張先生以其不愆不撓之精神，亙卅年如一日，用能使先公志事，更趨發揚，申報前途，日見踔躍。不肖嘗聞諸先公曰：『無陳光生之公正主張，不能使申報得大量讀者之擁護，無張先生之安詳措施，不能使同人收上下浹洽之宏效。」此固非先公一人之私論，不肖趨庭所獨聞，全報　人。凡在諳悉實際之情况者，咸能認爲不刋之定評也。他如張竹平汪英賓等諸君子以爲本報營業精心擘畫，不遺餘力，其功亦不可沒。</p>
<p>今申報已達二萬五千號。秋收之茂，導力於耕耘；輪奐之宏，程勞於版築。而先公與張先生，皆以盡瘁之身，未克躬覩斯盛。撫茲追昔，能無慨然！所幸陳先生猶能爲申報負發行之責，而頃來主持社務之潘公展陳訓念兩君，一則先公之舊侶，一則報界之雋秀。預計此後申報，必能更躋於恢弘。詠賡行能無似，末由績服先緒，慙恧恍惚之中，亦唯有隨諸君于之後，佇觀厥成而已！</p>

<h3>申報的新生</h3>
<p>「一二八」日寇偸襲珍珠港，突破了太平洋的沉寂；孤島的　上海，也隨太平洋的波浪而沉淪了。申報的言論，本來敵僞視爲　眼中釘，這時他們想利用申報七十多年的老牌子，强迫命令復刋，不久又派　逆彬解前來，實行强迫接收。從此這悠久解史的申一報，爲敵僞所把持，暫時陷入黑暗時期。</p>
<p>勝利的爆竹，消除了籠單着的黑幕，仍恢復到昔日的光明，申報也開始他的新生。經三年奸僞却持的申報，宛如一個百病麗身的人，須要好好地珍治調養。中央對於這歷史悠久的申報，也特別關切，派中委潘公展氏爲指導員兼總主筆，立法委員陳訓金氏爲總經理兼總編輯，悉心規劃，於卅四年十一月廿二日正式復刊。卅五年五月，指導期滿，交還公司。五月十五日董監事聯席會議，決定聘潘公展爲社長兼總主筆，陳訓　爲總經理兼總編輯。申報自經改組以後，面目一新，組織愈臻健全。</p>
<p>申報復刊以後，編輯方面力求內容充實，竭力擴充新聞網。本市新聞，用集體採訪制，對於人力時間，兩俱經濟，而收效亦宏。外埠大小各城市，經駐有特派員記者通訊員，國外則歐美南洋日本等處重要城市，亦均有本報訪員之踪跡，經常與編輯部保持密切聯樂。因配合周詳，故各版版面，益見充實與生動。</p>
<p>除新聞外，照片插圖，亦極注意。本市新聞，有攝影記者多人，隨時攝取照片，以供應用。外埠特派員記者等，也常有新聞照片，供各版刊登。此外特約紐約時報，供給國外新聞照片，以配合國際新聞。大量照片之刊登，使讀者對於新聞更易了解，版面也格外活潑。</p>
<p>資料室也大事擴充。添購大批中西圖書雜認，整理新舊書報，搜羅名人傳略照片，及各機關社會之概况，以供編輯時的參考</p>
<p>申報復刊後，銷數激增，建及綏寗甘新西康等地。會爲遠地讀者便利起見，發行影印版，大小僅及原版五分之二，便於航空遞送，讀者負擔减輕不少，而淸晰美觀，庋藏亦更相宜。惜因印刷關係而中輟，希望不久仍能恢復。</p>
<p>自去年七月份起，申報爲促進國貨產品之推鎖起見，徇各大廠商之請，舉辦聯合大贈送，共辦五閱月，參加廠商由二十餘家增主八十餘家，共發出贈品總値二值五千萬元。今年八月份起，各廠商）爲慶祝申報七十五周年，暨兩萬五千號紀念，重復　辦。</p>
<p>前面說過；申報經常從各處得到許多照片，除一小部份在報紙上刋出外，大多數因受篇幅限制，朮能登載出來。今年元旦，申報就將這許多未經用過的照片一，在杭州舉辦了一次時事照片展一覽會，轟動了整個杭州市。接着又在南京·蘇州·南通·福州·台灣·北平·各地展覽。每到一處，必有一番盛况。在未舉行展覽會前，南京本經常有時事照片陳列在辦事處，每星期更換一次。杭州靑年館，也經常展覽。照片原是最生動，最眞實的紀錄，尤其是敎育尙未普及的中國，更容易吸引觀衆。申報這幾次照片展覽，實具有重大的敎育意義。此外，杭州西湖博物館，向申報徵求了全套關於國民大會開會的照片，保存這有意義的歷史文獻。郵政總局也申報索取照片，作爲繪製郵票圖案的張本。這兩件事，更增加了時事照片的身價。</p>
<p>利用無綫電播送新聞，也是申報新創的一件工作。我國報紙的銷數，和歐美各國比較起來，實在少得可憐，這是因爲不能看報的人太多了。經過八年抗戰後，人民對於國事，較前關心，但除偶然聽到一點外，就無法獲得了。申報謀在原有的讀者外，使更多的人獲得時事知識，於三月十七日起，與全市十八家民營及公營廣播電台合作，每日晨午晚一播送新聞三次，頗得各界好評。一尤其像國軍攻入延安的消息，國防部還是在那天下午四時半接到一西安電話，上海各電台則已在六一點鐘將申報這消息播送出來了。</p>
<p>申報利用無綫電播送新聞，將報紙的範圍，從平面擴展到立體，是一項很大的成就。旋又舉辦星期日全天特別廣播，輪流在各電台舉行。內容有一周時事述評，名人演講，各地通訊，科學常識講座，社會服務等項目，以傳播文化爲主，配以高尙音樂，游藝節目，以提倡正當的娛樂。</p>
<p>申報除本身的業務外，對於社會事業，也很重視。過去曾辦過許多社會事業，頗有成績。復刋以後，對社會服務的工作，仍繼續進行。除經常在報上發表的醫華顧問，法律顧問之外，先後曾舉辦助產運動，防癆Ｘ光檢查，孤寡貧病救濟金，籌募殉難報人遺族撫恤金等。最近又舉辦助學金運動，預定目標爲十億元，連日來捐款源源不絕而來，惟前來申請之學生，爲數極夥，預定十億元之數，尙感粥少僧多，不敷分配。</p>
<p>人生七十古來稀，然從事業方面講，七十五年祗不渦是整個事業的一小段。申報在中國新聞界中，是老大哥，但他的精神，並沒有衰老。尤其在復刋以後，反老還童，恢復了他的靑春，富於蓬勃的朝氣，努力地推進他的事業。</p>
<h3>通谷化的新聞</h3>
<p>早年申報的文字，雖未引經據典，但深奧雅麗，並非一般人所盡能懂得。好在那時看報的人，都通翰墨”編輯先生也以文字和典麗自炫，對於許多人的不能讀懂業種艱深文字，這事似乎他毫不相干。但申報早已認淸了報紙是宣揚文化的利器利所以除了本報之外，另出版了兩種更通俗的新聞。一是「民報」，二是圖畫新聞。</p>
<p>「民報」於淸光緒二年三月初五日創刋，每逢星期二，四，六發行一張，新聞都是用白話文寫的，一般識字的人都能看得懂。它的發刋吿白中說：「此報專爲民間而設，故字句俱如尋常說話，每句以及人民地名盡行標明，庶幾稍識字者，便於解釋。「這一張報紙，可算是白話報的鼻祖。</p>
<p>一九三六年三月卅一日，字林西報「六十年前」一欄中，載有談及民報的一段文字。略謂：「我們看申報館印行的民報，實在是一種新型的報紙。它的特點，在用通俗的文字寫成，讀者易於了解其內容，每句之末，都空一格，人民及地點，則用直綫及虛綫標於一旁。祇要讀過兩年書的人，就能閱讀。所以它能深入申報所不能達到的階段，如店員勞工之類」。</p>
<p>圖盡爲無字的新聞，比白話文的報紙更容易明瞭。申報自民國十九年起，發行圖畫增刋，隨報附送，頗得好評。但申報之有圖畫刋物，最早遠在淸光緒初年。光緒三年八月間，創「瀛寰畫報」，載世界時事風俗圖說，爲不定期刋物，每本十餘頁，由英國名畫師繪圖，蔡爾康氏加以說明，共出五卷，光緒十年四月起，又出畫報，每十日發行一次，每册圖畫八幅，均爲新聞中可驚可記之事。因爲是由點石齋印刷的，所以名爲點石齋盡報。</p>
<p>六十年後的今日，我國的敎育仍未普及，不識字的人還很多。報紙上的文字，雖然已經很通俗化了，但看不懂報紙的人，也仍不在少數。近時社愈的演進，尤其是經過了八年的抗戰，使許多人對於國內外的事情，更迫切希望知道。所以在目前的情形看來，文字通俗的報紙，以及用岡畫來報導的新聞，仍是十分需要的，中報很可以負起這個責任來。</p>
<h3>文字獄</h3>
<p>報紙之責任，在於報導消息，宣揚民意。遜淸末業，政治不修，對於輿論的批評，視爲眼中釘，故各衙署消息，莫不嚴密封鎖，凡涉及軍財政事的新聞，採訪實非易事。甚至有因此而引起文字獄者。</p>
<p>光宣之交，報館成立漸多，新聞競爭頗烈。北平為當時政治策源地，各方視綫所集中，於是各報館均羅致人員，採訪消息。當時本報之通訊員，爲鍾申叔。鍾氏供職軍機處，位雖不甚高，但朝堂機密大事，時得窺見一二，故以中書舍人，博得小軍機的頭銜，然大獄亦由此而起。</p>
<p>鍾氏任事至勤，自受聘本報後，每日必有函一通，以報導消息，雖僅一鱗半爪內蘊未敢畢宣，但珍聞秘訊，己足爲本報生色不少。某日，忽得一私電，謂鍾某以洩漏機密被捕。同仁極爲驚駭，然又無法去電詢問吉凶。同時被捕者尙有電報局司機陶君。另有雷某，亦被牽涉，幸在津聞得消息，先事匿避，雖未被捕，然亦因受驚而患神經病。鍾陶二人，初擬處以極刑，幸得有力者斡旋，從寬發落，遣戍新疆。鍾氏夙負才名，交遊甚廣，事後有人代爲疏通，來滿二年即得釋歸，陶某革則至光復時始恢復自由，一塲太獄，如此結束，尙爲幸事。</p>
<p>氏爲人誠篤，處事謹愼，而本報編輯諸公，對於鍾氏所供給之消息，亦必經再三考慮後，方爲發表，想不致陷鍾氏於獄。但這一塲風波發生原因，始終不明。事從有人談及，方知此案內幕，爲一國際陰謀。蓋其時帝俄正謀吞噬我國東北，故川種種方法，刺探我國機密，組成一大規模之間諜網。陶某等爲其所利用，鍾亦牽入，以致身遭縲綫，非眞正之文字獄也。</p>
<h3>最暢銷的一天</h3>
<p>本報的銷數，隨着本報的年齡而增加，由數百，數千，數萬，至數十萬。但和歐美的報紙來比較，他們一天要銷數百萬份，眞是瞠乎其後了。</p>
<p>在平時，報紙的銷數，總是穩定在一個固定的數字上上，雖然略有參差，爲數極微。每逢星期日，普通會多一些，逢着元旦，國慶等紀念日，銷數也會增多。否則一定發生了特別重大的事故。記得三十四年八月十一日晚上日本乞降，第二天，後方幾個大城市裏，所有報紙都被搶購一空，遲一點就買不到。</p>
<p>在從前，國內外的重要消息，並不能引起許多人的興趣。那時他們所最關心的，是鄕會試的放榜。參加考試的人，當然想早些知道考試的結果；爲父兄的，也很關切他十弟的功名；連親戚朋友，以及同一鄉里的人，都覺得認識榜上的人，是一件很榮譽的事。所以鄕會試放榜那天的盛况，也許會和美國大總統選舉揭曉的日子相彷彿。本來在科舉時代，所謂大登科，是人生的一件大事。</p>
<p>鄕會試的發榜，本來是張貼在禮部或學院之前的。那時有許多人，專幹那報子的工作，將榜上已經錄取的人，用最快的方法，去報告他家裏，和他的親戚，老師，可以博得許多賞銀。好在這是一椿大喜事，他們多化幾兩銀子，也很高興的。</p>
<p>本報出版以後，每逢會試或江南各省鄕試的放榜日期，即將錄取的名單，在報上披露。於是許多直接或間接和考試有關的人，學着購買，這一天的銷數就特別多，並且還臨時漲價。那時申報的銷數，雖大都紙在江南一帶，但江南文風素盛，關心科舉放榜的人也特別多，於是這一天成爲報紙銷路最暢的一天。這數字和現在的銷數相比，仍是很小的，但在那時，實在是很大了。</p>
<h3>尊聞閣</h3>
<p>在申報三樓採訪室中，掛着一張題着「尊聞閣」三字的圖額。按所題的日期推算，那是光緒八年的事，迄今已有六十五年。當題寫這匾的時候，現在不館的老同事中，祗有戴雲卿先生一人已經出世了，但選在蹣跚學步的時候呢！它和本報關係的歷史，確可說不短了。</p>
<p>「尊聞閣」三字，爲錢塘吳鞠譚先生手筆，是爲申報的房屋而題的。過去廳堂齋屋，大都有題字，尤其是文人，更喜歡題上些風雅的區額。申報是文人雅士朝夕相處之所，當然不能免俗，這「尊聞閣」三字是含有「尊重新聞事業」的意思的。</p>
<p>從「尊聞閣」三字，不免要聯想到本報的房屋了。最初本報是在漢口路紅禮拜堂對面，就是現在市政府的地方。那義是二層樓的舊式建築，斗室翼然，微燈永夜，和今日的崇樓傑構比較，相去不可以道里計。這三樣敝屋，就是申報早年同人起息之所，尊聞的匾額，也就應掛在那裏。</p>
<p>宣統年間，營業日益發達，舊屋不敷應用，乃遷至望平街二百六十三號。那裏裏三層樓的房屋，雖然仍是極古老的洋房，但和以前的比較，已經寬暢得許多，光綫也進步多了，這是申報的第二故居。</p>
<p>民國二年，史量才先生接辦後，即計劃自建新厦，以策永久。結果，擇定了漢口路山東路轉角之處，設計繪圖，鳩工興建。到民國七年，新厦落成，就是今日的館屋。這一所鋼骨水泥的五層新康，外表至爲壯麗，內部也明期軒暢，那年十月，遂再作第三次的遷移。這新厦當時的造價，計化銀七十餘萬兩，但因時値歐戰，水泥鋼骨等來源缺乏，價値奇昂，承建的營造廠，爲此竟虧折達十萬元之巨。後來史量才先生知道了，於建築費之外，慨然再贈與五萬元，以補貼其　所</p>
<p>自建房屋，是申報開其端的。中幫當時建造這樣的房屋，就可以表示出主持人對於辦報的魄力與熱心。那時雖然有許多人酸溜溜地批評說不該如此浪費，但同業中對之却不勝羨慕，尤其是那淸潔衛生的厠所，更爲各報的編輯先生們所「垂涎」。那時包天笑先生爲自由談撰小說，所以有享用這厠所的權利，其他各報編輯之與包先生相識者，亦多乘機私自來解決「便」的問題，申報館眞是大開方便之門了。</p>
<p>十年後，這所五層大廈，又感不敷了，於是民國十九年間在舊屋南面又添建新屋一座·和舊屋相毗連·高低式樣和舊屋也相同，合成爲口字形的一座。去年復在新屋的平台上，加建一層，所以現在前半部仍爲五層，而後半部則已是六層了。</p>
<h3>買辦和師爺</h3>
<p>申報最初創刋的時候，編輯方面，由蔣芷湘主筆政，何桂笙，錢昕伯裏助編務。後來蔣芷湘高捷南宮，自然不願再幹這落拓文人的事了。（當時的人對新聞事業，皆作如此看法。）於是改延何桂笙主其事，其後又由錢昕伯·黃式權繼之。會計方面，長初是趙逸如，後來是席子眉。席子眉過世，乃由其弟子佩綱之。這是那時申報館的陣容，雖然是唱開　　，可是（角兒也相當地整齊。</p>
<p>「買辦」和「師爺」這兩個名詞，現在是已不大聽見了。但當年的申報，在洋人主持之下，會計和編輯方面的人，却是被人稱爲「買辦」和「師爺」的。</p>
<p>他們雖榮膺了「買辨」或「師爺」的頭銜，可是生活是十分淸苦的。那時最高的新水，祗有四十元，餘則依次遞降，最低的只有十餘元。飲食，洗衣，理髮，以及筆忠之費，均取給於此。雖然那時生活程度尙低，但德已覺得很周棘不來。據說那時的何桂笙，月薪三十元，他生平歡　買書，每月總有一半的錢用在買書上面，所以常常陷於身無分文的困境，只好每天獨自一人，跑到楊柳樓台，泡上一壺茶，買幾個燒餅充飢，這倒可以和馮煥章將軍的大餅油條生涯媲美。</p>
<p>那時報人不但待遇　薄，就是辦公的地方也很簡陋。本報一位老記者雷增，曾記述本館早期的狀况，有云：「當時申報房屋，本極敝舊，惟西人辦公處，尙軒爽潔淨。若吾棐趣居辦事之所，方廣不逾尋丈，光綫黑暗，而欲食，睡眠，便溺，悉在其中。冬則寒風砭骨，夏則熾熱如爐。最難堪者，臭蟲生殖之繁，到處蠕蠕，大堪驚異，往往終夜被擾，不能睡眠。」讀了這幾句話，亦可想見當年報人生活的困苦情形了。</p>

<h3>本報簡史</h3>
<p>當本報編印「最近之五十年」時，編者曾說過這樣幾句話：</p>
<p>「將紀念五十年乎？是必其人至少在五十以上，方合編者資格。且二十齡以內，爲人生求學之年’即有聞見，其足供著書資料與否，猶未敢信。然則編輯五十年紀念書者，其人至少年必在七十以上。而異日編百年紀念書，更安所得若干百歲老人，紛披其老筆耶！」</p>
<p>今年爲本報的七十五週紀念，正像「最近之五十年」編者所預料到的，可惜沒有一位百歲老人，來替他寫這篇簡史。現在所寫的，只能仿史家舊例，凡是見聞所不及的，付諸「傳聞」之列。</p>
<p>申報的上古史，據張蘊和君（默）在「六十年來之申報」一文中所述，謂：</p>
<p>「前淸同治之末，有英人安納斯脫美查Ｅcnest　Major者，在滬創辦公司，申報即其所營事業中之一部分也。時滬上未有報紙，而美查獨首先創辦，在吾人今日觀察，必謂其有何野心，或欲籍以操縱輿論，或欲籍以侵略文化。然在當時之美查，確未有此種深意，不過視爲營業之一稱，兼便其商業上之宣傳而已，故創辦後，一切俱委華人經理，初執筆政者爲蔣芷湘。」</p>
<p>此爲申報刋行之始，實在前淸同治十一年壬申三月二十三日，亦即西曆一八七二年四月三十日。當時創辦者尙不止一人，胡道靜君申報六十六年史云：</p>
<p>「申報爲英人美查與友人伍華德C.Wordward，樸賣懿W.B.Pryer,約翰瓦其洛JohnWachillop四人合辦，每人出股本規銀四百兩，於一八七一年五月十九日，即前淸同十年四月初一日，訂立合同，創辦一張中國文字的日報。」</p>
<p>館中人物，據雷君曜君（管）「申報館之過去狀况」一文中說：</p>
<p>「館址在英租界漢口路迤東，聞最初華經理，係浙人趙姓，故所延主筆，如何桂笙，錢昕伯等，均隸浙籍。」</p>
<p>所謂浙籍趙姓，乃指趙君逸如。黃式權君（協塤）「本報最初時代之經過」一文云：</p>
<p>「館中先後主筆政者，爲蔣蔣君芷湘，錢君昕伯，昕伯謝事，以不才承其乏。總理譯務者，爲畢君禮納H.A.pereira，副之以董君筠孫。總司會計者爲趙君逸如，席君子眉，子眉死，其弟子佩繼之，此皆西人爲館主時事。」</p>
<p>然不久美查又無意經營，黃君曰：</p>
<p>「是時申報銷數益暢旺，美查欣然曰：我之心力已瘁矣，吾之名譽已揚矣。我以申報所獲之利，添設點石齋石印書局，圖書集成鉛印書局，燧昌火柴廠，江蘇藥水廠，已次第吿厥成功矣。急流勇退，正在此時，乃將申報館改爲公司，已則航海返故國。」</p>
<p>美查旣去之後，尙有一小小過渡時代。雷君云：</p>
<p>「光緒二十三年丁酉，美查獲利回國，公司大班爲英人阿拍拿E.O.Abuthnot，翻譯爲葡萄牙人畢禮納，華經理仍爲席君子眉，主筆房爲黃君式權，而全館總權，操諸英大班之手。惟大理不諳華語，過館事有所商酌，均由畢禮納傳譯，蓋畢君固溝通中外，聯絡上下之樞紐也。」</p>
<p>本報之收回自辦，實在淸宣統元年四月十三日，即西曆一千九百〇九年五月三十一日，上距美查創辦，歷時已三十七年。張君紀其經過云：</p>
<p>「靑浦金君劍華，松江雷君君曜，迎合新潮，繼黃式權君總持筆政。又以公司大班，雖於中國政情隔膜，不大千涉，然以一國之言論機關，而爲外人所左右，不能自由獨立，則甚危險，乃力促華經理席子佩君，向西人交涉收回。公司大班商之於各董事，允以七萬五千元之代價，將申報館全部產業，讓與華人，即由席君與之訂約。申報至是，始完全入於我華人之手。」</p>
<p>金曾兩君，旋亦離館，張君網主筆政。未幾，革命成功。至民國初年，本館第一件大事，則爲史量才君接手辦理。張君記其經過云：</p>
<p>「民國成立，全國充滿革新之氣象，人民欣欣然翹首企望於前途之發展者無窮，而申報亦適於此時易主。史量才君入館爲總理，聘陳景韓君（冷）爲總主筆。史君入館後，籌劃一切行政事務，幷羅致實心辦事者數人爲助，將館務次第擴充。陳君則將編輯部事，逐漸整理。故斯時之申報，更有欣欣向榮，大踏步向上發展之勢。」</p>
<p>胡君亦云：</p>
<p>「一九一二年，即民國元年，席子佩君將申報館售與史量才君，於同年九月二十三日訂約，十月二十日移交。史君自任總經理，採取新法，引用新人，營業更爲增進，隱然成了上海報業界的領袖。」</p>
<p>本報的總管理處，成立於民國二十一年一月，爲總攬全館事權的最高機構，內部組織，煥然一新。但不幸史君於民國廿三年十月六日，在滬杭道中遇書，館中失去了主持大計的人物，乃組織董事會，以代總經理職權。又閱三年，而有七七事變。胡君云：</p>
<p>「有話便長，無話便短，話說到了民國二十六年七月七日，吾國發動對暴日全面抗戰。八月十三日，東戰塲戰事開始。我軍在上海作戰三月，按照預定戰略，全師後撤，誘敵深入。除了租界以外，上海全市，淪入日手。這時候，日軍趾高氣揚，對於租界內仍然刊行着的中國報紙，大爲嫉視，於是組織僞新聞檢查所，通知各華報自是年十二月十五日起，須將報紙小樣送檢，幷通知租界當局，華報不送檢查者，當封閉之。各報激於義憤，寗死不屈，或於事前，或限期時，都自動宣吿暫時停版。申報於民國二十六年十二月十四日出版，至第二萬三千二百零八號後，即停止發刊。十二月十四日，申報刊登一顯明的啓事云：「茲因環境關係，自十二月十五日起停刊，特此通吿，即希公鑒」。</p>
<p>「當戰爭在上海進行的時候，申報已將一部分印刷機械，遷到了漢口，預備申報漢出，繼續其鼓勵民族精神的使命。刊行了六十五年的申報，在上海停刋後，漢口版便積推極行出報，至民國二十七年一月十五日，正式出版。是年三月一日，復在香港發行港版，兩地同時刊行。</p>
<p>「民國廿七年八月一日起，申報漢口版停止出版。機器遷至桂林，擬在桂林刊行，但未實現。此時已進行滬報復刋。</p>
<p>上海失陷後，租界由英美商人所辦華文報，仍守正不阿，竭力報導準確消息，鼓勵中國民衆精神。日人對此第三國家主持正義之產業，雖不愜意，但亦無從侵犯。上海申報於是用美商哥倫比亞出版公司承辦。民國二十七年十月十日復刊。滬港兩地，同時出版」。</p>
<p>自從太平洋戰事發生以後，本報陷於黑暗時代，至三十四年，始得重睹天日革新組織。十二月二十二日的復刋辭云：</p>
<p>「申報在過去對中國的新聞界，文化界，乃至社會一般方面，曾盡過一些微勞。除了廿六年因國軍西撤，曾一度停刋外，在它的出版紀錄上，從沒有報過刋，可是自太平洋戰爭起後，申報即爲敵僞所刧持，行動失去了自由，此後雖仍有申報之刋行，已非申報自由意志之表示，於法於理，均屬無效。故申報今日復刋，其號數上承中華民國三十年十二月八日」。；「申報在抗戰初期，當國軍西撤，上海租界還存留之際，我們一面除借重美商，不爲敵寇所屈外，更在漢口香港，先後出版。在這中間，申報記者金君華亭，曾爲敵僞狙擊以死。其他同人，則或橫被凌逼而不甘屈服，或受書苦難而志節不移，都足爲我申報永留正氣」。</p>
<p>復刊道天爲二萬四千三百三十八號，到今天恰爲二萬五千號，而自淸同治十一年至今，屈指又爲七十五年。當本報進入一萬號時，尙在淸光緒廿七年二月十四日，是日評論題目爲」本報第一號記」，中云：</p>
<p>「所望中國懲前毖後，竭力維新，有利皆興，無廢不舉。」</p>
<p>至民國十一年，本報五十周年，發刊「最近之五十年」紀念册。陳景韓君撰「二十年來記者生涯之回顧」一文，中有數語云：</p>
<p>「前之十年，余對報紙，惟有一念，時時自思曰：必若何而後人閱吾報。後之十年，余對於報紙，另易一念，必若何而後人閱吾報而有益。」</p>
<p>張君於「六十年來之申報」一文中，即引此語，並謂：「名言至理，非特今日紀念六十周年之同人，所當奉爲圭泉，即至將來六百年六千年後之新聞界，亦必不能改易者也。」</p>
<p>二萬號之刊行，在民國十七年十一月十九日。陳君又云：</p>
<p>「申報乃歷史之縮影，申報乃歷史館，雖屬過譽，惟願從二萬號始，寢假而至十萬百萬號，永遠爲公衆服務，進而可作世界史觀。」</p>
<p>民國二十一年七月二十一日，本報創刋申報月刋，以紀念六十周年，在創刋詞吾們的使命中說：</p>
<p>「吾們要盡文化和經濟的使命，以增進民衆幸福爲前提，向前邁進，達到光明康莊的坦途。」</p>
<p>最後，我們仍引復刋辭中的幾句話：</p>
<p>「民主國家的建設，當以公正與論爲基礎。申報復刋，沒有什麼崇高理想，但願爲讀者作新聞忠實之報導，登載一件事，發表一句話，必再三斟酌是否與人民大衆有益，是否與國家大局世界大局補。」</p>
<h3>本報原始</h3>
<p>近代的中國新聞事業，由洋商開始經營，申報就是在這種情形之下誕生的。一八七一年五月十九日，英人美查，和他的朋友伍華德，樸賣懿，瓦其洛，簽訂一張合同，來創辦一張華文報紙—就是申報。但申報的創刋號，却在第二年的四月三十日，到今年剛好是七十五年。美查創辦申報之後，直到一九〇九年，才由國人收回自辦。所以七十五年來，有三分之一的時間是在洋商經營之下長大的。今天寫申報的歷史，這最早的一個時期當然是省不掉的。</p>
<p>當本報創刋的時候，正值國內戰事次第停止，同時外力的壓迫還沒有十分覺得，人民喘息方定，以爲從此可以太平無事了。熟中的人，仍忙於奔走鑽營，傳取富貴。一般學子，則從事據帖制藝，迷戀於科舉一途。申報在這粉飾太平的環境中，編輯取材也以此爲依歸。那時申報的內容，一爲諭旨，京報，宮門抄等，報導官塲的消息。一爲大小考的題目，是給讀書人參考的。另有詞歌曲，那是名士們興之所至，吟風弄月之作。所謂新聞，却是各地的火警命案，異聞怪事，祗可供一般人茶餘酒後的閒談資料罷了。比較像樣一點的，是論說一篇，相當於現在的社評，但題材旣不和時事相關，文字亦極迂腐，可是在當時，還不免被人斥爲反動！那時新聞的來源，國內祗有少數大都市，派有訪員，國外新聞，都是從香港報紙繙譯或轉載還來的。同時因爲交通不便，一件事的發生，距離報上所發表的日期，至少在一星期或十天左右，遠的地方，甚至有一月以上的。這種記載，本已失去了新聞價値。好在刋出的大都是社會新聞，時效的關係少，同時讀者的心理，也不過當他們僞傳奇小說之罷了。</p>
<p>那時的申報，不僅是內容上很空虛，形式上也極呆板。一大張的毛太紙，是單面印的。全張分成八版，每版高關均約二十公分，兩版中間，還空出一點摺縫的地位。文字都是用四號鉛字排印的，標題也是道樣，廣吿則改用五號字。除了論說及重要文字的標題，另列一行外，導常新聞，題目祗和正文隔開一個字。這樣一張報紙，看起來很像木版書的殘葉，古色古香，令人「發思古的幽情」。但在當時條件不元備，已經算是很不容易的了。</p>
<p>申報創刊時，隔天出版一次。從第五號（一八七二年五月七日）起，改爲每天出版，但星期日是停列的。直到一八七九年四月廿七日，星期日也照常出版。</p>
<p>一八八一年，是中國交通史上的一個新轉變。那年十二月廿四日，上海天津間的電報完成。當時一般人想，在南北相隔三千里的長途，能從電綫上傳送書借，這是破天荒的奇事，同時，那時一般人的時間觀念，還很淡薄，非有十分緊要的事情，決不會煩勞這件新的工具。美查在電報將通之前，就通知天津訪員，以後淸廷諭旨，可用電報傳送。從此隔六七日才能接到的京報，當天可以收到，第二天即在報上刋出了。中國新聞界用電報傳送新聞，這是第一次。再過三年，北平天津間的電綫，又數設完成。那時朝野大事，有時也用電報來傳達。於是，新聞漸漸眞以「新」的姿態出現了。</p>
<p>在申報出版後兩年，日本藉口台灣生番殺人，興兵進攻番社。這是很好的新聞資料，美查便親自出馬，探訪消息，並搜羅關於台灣的史事，風物，和新聞相配合，一同在報上刋出。那時一般讀者，大多以消遺爲主，官塲中人，或者略爲注意一點政治上的消息，但也很有限的。自從美查利用這種新穎的材料以後，便大大的引起了讀者的興趣，銷數因而激增。</p>
<p>一八八四年，法軍侵入越南；美查鑒於過去日人攻襲台灣消息，極爲讀者所歡迎，這次中法戰事，更要大大地利用一下，於是雇了俄國人爲訪員，到法國軍營中去採訪消息，用電報由香港經厦門傳送到上海。第二年，法兵艦攻襲寗波，申報仍派俄人前往。那時中國的戰事失利，別家報紙却諱莫如深，獨申報報導準確的消息。最初許多人却以爲申報偏袒法國，但事後證明申報的消息是不錯的，銷數又大增，同時廣吿客戶也源源而來，原有的篇幅已容納不下，只有加出附張。</p>
<p>當申報創刋時，正値中國大轉變，這時機是可以利用的，但也是最不容易應付的。申報在材料缺乏，設備簡陋的環境中出版，而讀者又寥寥無幾，恰好逢到兩次戰役，申報便把握時機，奠定了基礎。隨着銷數的增加，紙張也逐漸地改善了。最初的申報，是用毛太紙印的。迨刋載了日本攻台灣的眞相後，銷數增至數千，毛太紙已不適用，一八七四年九月十一日起，改用賽連紙印刷。至一八八四年，又因中法之數而增加銷數，不得不摒棄手工製的賽連紙，而改爲機製的油光紙。鴉片之戰，雖打開了中國的大門，但除了頭腦淸醒的以外，一般人仍未醒悟。及甲午戰敗，人心始爲之一震；戊戍政變，大殺黨人，人心又爲之一震；庚子拳匪之亂，八國聯軍入京，人心又爲之一震。人民經過了三次刺激，宛如大夢方醒，才曉得朝廷的昏庸，政治的腐敗，才知道世界潮流趨勢，新的思想，新的見解，紛紛而來，許多報紙，大都也是遵循着這條路綫的。那時襄助申報筆政者金劍華，雷君曜兩人，頭腦十分新頴，竭力迎合潮流，計劃改革辦法。這距離初出版時已三十四年，正是七十五年的一半。</p>
<p>一九〇五年一月，即光緒三十年的年底，全館的幹部人員，討論了兩日兩夜，才把改革的辦法議定。二月七日起，就以新的姿態和讀者相見。這張報紙的新面目，在形式方面，篇輻擴充爲正附兩張，分上下兩欄排列，標題用較大一號字，以醒眉目。內容方面，新聞是被重視了，在各省通都大邑，均延聘訪事，採錄新聞，尤其是關於交通商業消意，更爲詳細。在歐西各國，也羅致訪員，探詢國際情形。同時，重要消息，凡電報已通之地，均用電報傳送，俾讀者先覩爲快。社論方面以適合時代之需求，除主筆經常撰寫外，外界如有精闢時論，也酌量選登，以收集思廣益之效。同時，譯東西各報文字，以作參考。</p>
<p>一向被人認為老成掛重的申報，也突然改變了論調，是使大家覺得很驚異的。那時社會上的思想，分成兩派，一派主張維新，一派主張保守。申報的改革，卻使兩派的思想匯流。保守的人，看到申報的態度也改變了，覺得大勢所趨，非變法自强不可。而維新的人，以爲申報的論讞，也對他們表示同情，更增强了他們新力量。的確，那一次申報的革新，是使許多人相顧愕然的。</p>
<p>美查創辦申報，純粹以營利爲目的，所以一切編輯上的事務，完全交付華人處理。最早的主筆是蔣湘芷君，繼任者有何桂笙君，錢聽伯羣，黃式權羣。代理編務的人，先後有蔡寵九·蔡支佛·姚竹君·張筱軒·錢明略·賴慧生·劉鶴伯·金劍華·雷君曜·趙孟遴·潘正卿·黃憲生·沈寅階諸君。洋人僅葡葡牙人畢禮納，主持繙譯事宜。經理部方面，最初為趙逸如君，趙君去世，改延席子眉君，子眉死，由其弟子佩　之。</p>
<p>美查在上海所辦的事業，除甲報外，有燧昌火柴廠，江蘇藥水廠，圖書集成印書局，點石齋印刷局等。即報館本身，除每天出報外，也以出版事業爲副業。（一）編印綜合性的月刊，「瀛寰瑣記」，「四溟瑣記」，「寰宇瑣記」等，專刊論文，小說，詩詞等。（二）編印通俗性的「民報」，專爲婦孺，工商，不能了解高深文字的人閱讀之用。（三）編印「瀛　畫報」，擇世界時事風俗之有趣味者，繪製成圖，略附說明，爲中國畫報的鼻祖。因由點石齋印刷，所以稱爲點石齋畫報。（五）用活體鉛字排印袖珍本叢書，開風氣之先。先後印行一百餘種，包括翻印舊的和刊印新的，其中頗有價値的資料。同時嚴密的校訂，淸晰的印刷，也可以和淸代武英殿本相媲美，人稱申報聚珍版。其中也有一部份是由圖書集成印書局出版的。</p>
<p>一八八九年，美查忽動還鄕之念。於是將所經營的事業，改組爲美查有限公司，包括江蘇藥水廠，燧昌自來火廠，申報館，申昌書局，及申報館房屋基地等。資產估計共爲三十萬兩，分作六千股。美查收回原有資本，折成二千股，航海返國。公司事務改由董事挨波諾脫·麥邊·麥根治·梁金治，及經理芬林主特一切。其時國人已獲得美查公司一部份股權，所以粱君也列爲四董事之一</p>
<p>一九〇九　，　查公司董事擬出售申報，以擴充江蘇藥水廠，華經理席子佩君乃以七萬五千元的代價，把申報盤了下來。從此這最有歷史的言論機關，完全歸於國人了。這時距美查創辦包有三十七年，報館的洋商時代，至此才吿一結束。</p>

<h3>史量才先生的事業</h3>
<p>若以美查時代爲申報的創業時期，則史量才先生之經營，爲申報的改進及擴充時期。申報之所以能成爲一龐大之企業，在中國新聞史上，佔重要之一頁者，皆史氏之力，有以致之。</p>
<p>民國元年，史量才先生以十二萬元之代價，接辦申報，爲總經理，延陳景韓君爲主筆，張竹平君爲經理，採用新法，羅致新人，改革版面，充實內容，氣象爲之一新。營業蒸蒸日上，開始向發展之途邁進。</p>
<p>方鼎革初成，共和肇始，革新氣象，洋溢全國，人民對於國家民族之前途，寄以無窮之期望。不久，歐戰發生，關於新世界之現狀，及中國在國際上之地位，渴望有所知曉。接着又有五四運動發生，靑年學子，對於新文化，新智識之舖要，更爲迫切。申報亦追隨時代潮流，迎合讀者需要，而加以改進。除社評及新聞外，更設置專欄多種。</p>
<p>民國八年八月卅一日起，創「星期增刋」、多譯國外報章雜誌之論著與要聞，對國際時事作有系統的介紹，以補充日常國際新聞之不足。民國九年六月一日起，增闢「常識副刋」，內容有經濟，衛生，科學，市政，禮俗等，灌輸國民應有之普通知識」更努力於民權主義之宣傳。民國十三年二月八日起，復出「本埠增刋」，專爲本埠各界服務，登載上海各種社會事業之活動狀態，及戲院商店之廣吿。</p>
<p>專刋之創設，最早爲「汽車增刋」，始於民國十年十一月二十七日，登載公路建設消息及利用汽車文字。「敎育與人生」始於民國十三年十二月八日，乃由民國十二年所發行之敎育與人生」週刋演變而來，討論改進敎育問題。民國十四年，本埠增刋內，又另闢」藝術界」一欄，刋載關於藝術，運動，繪畫，音樂，舞蹈，攝影，歌曲之消息與評論。此後尙有經濟專刋，國貨週刋，醫藥週刋，無綫電週刋，建設專刋等，先後刊行，以饜讀者之望。</p>
<p>民國十九年五月十八日起，增「圖畫周刋」，每周出版一次，由名記者戈公振君主其事。戈氏經騐豐富，選材極精，又以橡皮版印於銅版紙上，更形美觀。申報早年曾編行瀛寰畫報，點石齋書報等，本爲畫刋之先河，但以時代進展，石印畫册已趨落五、故以照相製版代繪事，橡皮版代石印。</p>
<p>民國成立以後，政局不定，內亂紛起。因袁氏稱帝，而有雲南起義；因督軍專橫，張勳乘機復辟，而有馬廠　師；段氏秉政　南北又生鴻溝，衡陽發難，西南復有護法之役。接着便是奉直之戰，齊魯之役，國內分裂愈甚，政局日非，商業凋敝，金融枯竭，盜匪避起，民不聊生。迨國民軍誓師北伐，奠都南京，大局漸定，及東北易幟，遂完成南北統一大業。報紙所藉以推行者，爲鐵路之交通，然每戰一次，鐵路即中斷一次。報紙所賴以發展者，爲敏捷之電訊，然每戰一次，電訊即被檢查一次。申報在此環境中，應付至感困難，幸處理得宜，在在風駭浪中，更得進一步之發展。</p>
<p>申報努力與環境奪門，不至落於時代潮流之後者；除改進報紙內容外，對於器材設備等，凡足以增加報紙效率者，莫不集全力以赴。大館舍之建築，新式機器之購置，均先後實行，此亦申報得以進展之因素。申報館最初設於漢口路江西路之西，即現今市政府大廈之一部份。淸宣統年間，遷至山東路，較前已稍寬暢，但業務日益發展，舊屋又感不敷用，漸感租賃民房，總非長久之策，且亦不合報館之用。爲一勞永逸計，謀自建館屋。乃於民國四年，購得漢口路山東路轉角處之基地，從事設計繪圖，鳩工興築，即今之申報館大廈是也</p>
<p>新厦於民國五年開始興工，民國七年完竣，是年十月遷入。屋之外表壯麗，內部軒爽，計費銀七十茁兩。上海報館之自建館屋，亦以申報爲始。當新厦尙未完工之時，山東路房屋之業主，因故催促遷讓。乃就對面小屋，作營業部，而編輯與印刷二部，則設於天津路，兩處往返，旣多不便，房屋逼仄，尤感侷促也。</p>
<p>這座五樓新厦，內有房屋百餘間，在那時確乎綽綽有餘。但報館業務，日僉擴展，人員與日俱增，辦公房屋又覺狹小。乃於民國十九年，就舊屋之南，添建新屋一座，與舊屋合成一口字形。去年，復於新屋平台之上，加建一層。故現在前半部仍爲五層，而後半部已改爲六層了。</p>
<p>新屋落成之後，印刷機件亦大事革新。由報原有機器，每小時僅能印報紙四張各三千份。然銷數日增，已非原有機器所能勝任。且爲靈通消息起見，新聞稿須於午夜編竣，拂曉出版，俾得趕接早班火車，運往外埠，印報時間，僅一兩小時而已。故於新厦落成之翌年，即向美訂購最新式印報機一架。民國八年及十年，又先後添購三部。於是十餘萬份之報紙，能於兩小時內完全印畢。此外若銅版機·澆字機·紙版機·鉛版機·鉛字銅模·亦絡續置備，器材日見完善，效率日見增加。</p>
<p>民國二十一年，爲申報創刋六十周年。人生達花甲誕辰，必舉觴慶賀，而申報六十年來，艱苦經營，不僅樹立基礎，亦且日益進展，其歷史彌足珍貴。民國二十年九月一日，館中「以此」年度爲紀念年，對於讀者擬有所新貢獻，目九月一日起發表。」先從報紙本身改革入手，漸漸推行於各種附屬事業。</p>
<p>報紙如何革新呢？九月一日所載「本報六十周年紀念宣言」中，說明申報今後之方針：（一）努力宣揚科學新知識，以鼓勵國人研究之興趣。（二）陳述世界經濟情勢，解剖我國經濟特質，以求今後應取之路綫。（三）就目前各種矛盾之現象，探求諸社會問題之癓結，以求解決之道。（四）以誠摯之態度，對政府盡輿論之　　。（五）協助宵年解決困難，使進於健全純潔之坦途。（六）討論移民殖邊之計劃及問題，並較吹以促其實現。（七）喚醒國人對於我國之國際情勢，謀解脫不平等條約之束縛，而躋我國家民族於自由平等之地位。」</p>
<p>除改進報紙本身之外，附屬事業也次第創立。關於出版者，申報月刋，申報年鑑，申報地岡，申報叢書，在文化上，均有極大貢獻。申報月刋爲政治。經濟。文藝的綜合雜誌，自民國廿一年七月起發行，申述國內及國際之現實情况，並指陳其動向，以補日報之不足。旋以世界大勢，瞬息萬變，每月出版一次，猶覺時間過長。乃於民國廿五年起，改爲周刋。並爲普及起見，除零售定閱外，又隨報附送，與外國報紙之星期版相同。年鑑集一年來國內政治·經濟以及社會上重要事項，作有系統之叙述，附以各項統計，爲我國國情之編年信史。自廿二年起，迄廿五年止，每年編印一鉅册。申報叢書自廿二年起，陸續編行，內容以世界時事及各種智識爲主題，亦用以補充報紙材料。新地圖之樹印，乃出版事業中最重大的一項，聘丁文江·翁文灝·會世英三先生主持之，搜集各種精密材料，費時兩年餘，精心測繪而成。詳細明確，當時已無出其右者，採用等高綫設色，尤爲創舉。迄今仍爲中國地圖中的權戚。</p>
<p>其次，社會工作方面，先後成立申報流通圖書館，申報新聞函授學校，申報業餘補習校。申報流通圖書館剏於民國廿一年，藏書數千册，以供職業靑年求正當之消遺，並得增進其知識與技能。申報業餘補習學校乃流通圖書館的姊妹行，均爲戰業青年進修之所。當民國廿二年成立之初，僅在大陸商塲內，就流通圖書館之餘屋，闢敎室二間，收容學生八十餘人，其後學生日增，添設分校’未及兩年，學生已增至二千餘人，分校增設至五處之多，可見靑年求知欲之旺盛，需要之迫切　新聞函授學校設置，由於感覺外埠記者通訊買之缺乏，故有培養之必要，乃於民國廿一年成立此校，用通方式，訓練各地新聞人員，先後加入之學員，達八百餘人，遠及業古，西藏，新疆等處，歐美南洋前來參加者，爲數亦不少。此項工作，對於申報本身，固有相當收穫，而對於各地方報紙的貢獻則更多。當申報正努力革新，向社會文化之路發展不已之時，忽遇不幸之事。民國二十三年十一月十三日，史先生自杭州循滬杭公路返滬時中途遇害。史先生之逝世，不僅爲申報之不幸，亦爲全國新聞界之不幸，喪失了一位能幹事業的宏材。幸而申報館內部的組織嚴密，並未發生任何影響，繼續爲事業而努力。申報六十周年紀念所辦的許多社會文化事業，因爲環境關係，先後停辦，仍回到向來的崗位上，開拓新聞網，充實報紙的內容，每年派人赴各地搜集資料，撰寫特稿，頗得社會各界之贊許。</p>
<p>民國二十六年八二一三戰事爆發，我軍在滬經三越月之習勇作戰後，爲誘敵深入計，全師後撤，除租界外，上海全市淪入敵手，敵軍氣趾高揚，對於租界內之中國報紙，大爲嫉視，開始通知檢查新　，申報激於義憤，不甘受敵寇之檢查，乃於十二月十五日，宣吿停刋，此六七餘年歷史之申報乃不得不與滬地讀者暫吿分別。</p>

<h3>本報　出版事業　回顧</h3>
<p>過去七十五年間，本報除了肩負報導消息的本身任務以外，更能適應時代社會的需要，先後出版各類圖書刋物，數十年如一日；對於推進文化的工作，可謂盡了相當責任。茲將本報過去出版各種刋物，簡略叙述，作爲「七十五周年」的紀念和景仰前人的勞蹟，也就本報歷史上光榮的一頁。</p>
<p>聚珍版業書</p>
<p>本報當前淸光緒元年至二十年之間，用鉛製活字仿乾隆「聚珍版叢書」排印新著舊書。也稱爲聚珍版叢書（附註：淸高宗乾隆三十八年詔儒臣彙輯永樂　與內罕觀之籍，以木活字排版，共一百三十八種，定名「聚珍」。）先後刋行百六十餘種，當同治十三年十一月初，已有「儒林外史」等多種印成出售，而在光緒元年至四年之間，更刋佈吿白，廣事徵求，原文照錄如下：</p>
<p>「蒐書告白白啓者：本館以刷印各書籍發售爲常，如遠近諸君子有已成未刋之者作，擬將問世，本館願出價購稿，代爲排印，抑或俟裝訂好後，送書數十部或數百部，以申酬謝之意，亦無不可，總視書之易售與否而斟酌焉。再如藏有世上罕見之本，宜於重刋者，本館亦可以價買或送數十部新印之書，藉以報謝，至原本於刋成後，仍可璧繳也。」</p>
<p>稿本收到以後，大抵隨得隨刋，內容不一，以筆記雜錄居多，章回小說等籍，也不在少數。這類叢書，旣係活字排印，多者三千部，少者祗印一千，而且隨印隨拆，不能隨意再版，時至今日，留存的恐怕很少，極不易得，恐讀者不獲見原書眞面目，因略擇數種，各撰提要，以見一斑：　和約彙鈔六卷望炊輯</p>

<p>二十一年「一二八」事變發生，本報縮小篇幅，圖畫周刋出至八十六期，隨之暫停。二十三年三月十五日，改出圖畫特刋，每週發行二次；從第一八三期起，又恢復爲每週密版一次。二十六年全面抗戰發生後，又停刋。（下接二十一版）</p>

<h3>在孤島上博門</h3>
<p>「筆掃千軍」，本來祗是一句話罷了。但在這八年抗戰的過程中，新聞記者憑着一枝禿筆，來揭露敵人的陰謀，激發民衆的情緒，向敵人作精神上的打擊，正像一顆紙彈，向敵人尖銳有力地射去。在平時祗是宣揚文化的報紙，在戰時却產生了鬬爭的力量，成僞砲火以外的一種武器。那時新聞記者的一枝筆，的確相當於抗禦三軍的一員驍將。</p>
<p>在文化戰塲上，也有幾種不同方式的戰略。大後方的報紙是一枝防守的軍旅，淪陷區的報紙是一員游擊的戰士。申報則以火綫上士兵的姿態，在孤島上和敵人週旋過三年有餘。這是申報歷史上最艱苦的一個階段，終日在敵人陰謀暗算中過日子。直到民國三十年十二月八日珍珠港事件爆發，孤島陸沉，申報爲敵人所刧持，過一幕可歌可泣的壯烈史劇，才吿結束</p>
<p>七七·八一三·敵人的砲火由北而南，許多報紙先後被摧毀了。上海雖有租界，但在國軍西撤之後，也成爲孤島。申報鑒於上海環境惡劣，停止出版。後來發覺上海是文化戰略上很重要的據點，於是重新在上海復刋，那是民國二十七年的雙十節，申報從此開始過他的軍人生活了。</p>
<p>上海自從淪爲孤島以後，表面上還保持着租界的國際組織形式，但敵人的潛勢力已逐漸侵入了。許多報紙，都假借洋商的名義，籍以鼓吹抗戰意識，而不爲敵人所干涉。申報在復刋時，也掛上了美商的招牌，以哥倫比亞公司的名義重和上海的讀者相見</p>
<p>民國二十七年十月十日申報復刋詞，對於申報重行在滬出版之意義，有所闡述。當抗戰發動之初，申報即「爲正義人道而呼籲」，迨國軍西撇，上海淪爲孤島，申報爲「保持最後呼吸之自由」，而宣吿停刊。但兵連禍結，距勝利之期迢遠，申報「不欲久載厥影」，於是成立此美商公司的新機構。對於以後言論之方針：（一）仍以正養爲依歸，作爲中國人民之喉舌，與艱苦環境相奮鬬。（二）本三民主義之主旨，激厲中華民族的自信力，促進團結，培養勇氣。（三）敦睦中美邦交。（四）共同爲世界和平而努力。</p>
<p>當初所揭示的方針，旣如上述，復刊以後，即依據這目標而進行。評論的態度，在宣揚旣定國策，加强抗建信念，對敵寇的陰謀，盡情地予以揭發，抨擊汪逆的勾當，和屠殺同胞的暴行，澈底而嚴正。在國際上，指出敵寇向世界挑戰的野心。鼓勵同胞及資金的內遷，指示靑年應走的途徑，一切均以闡揚主義，擁護領袖，配合抗建國策爲中心的任務。這種言論，極爲敵寇所憚忌，工部局警務處也特別注意。</p>
<p>在新聞方面，盡量刋載和抗戰有關的材料，像中樞的決策，總裁的訓示，尤其是逢到逢到紀念日發表文吿等，總設法把他披露出來。在廿九年以後，敵寇　迫，日愈加重，全文很不容易登出，於是改寫爲新聞格式，排在最顯要的地方。許多關於抗戰和大後方的消息，並不是刋出了就算完事，必須把所擬的標題，抓住一個中心，使讀者見了能發生興趣。內容方面，也力求與事實相符合。最不容易弄淸楚的，是敵我對壘的形勢，則隨時繪製地圖，與新聞相配合，凡一個小村落，一條小河流，多要指示讀者一個正確的位置。</p>
<p>此外，多登特寫稿子，把大後方的生活印象，報導給上海的讀者，使他們發生嚮往之心。這項材料，大都選自重慶，昆明，桂林，杳港等地的報紙，或直接轉載，或軍行繕寫。外國雜誌如有這類文字，像美國生活雜誌的發行人羅天婦訪問重慶的紀載，美作家漢明威先生訪問陪都的報導，將他們繙語出來，在報上發表。如有適宜的照片，也盡量刋登。這種特禍，很引起廣大　者的興趣。</p>
<p>關於國際問題方面，曾向美國訂請大批雜誌刋物，作有系統的播擇工作，揭　納粹侵略歐洲的暴行，配以照　，名爲「默戰實錄」。其中像總軍長　進人巴黎時的氣燄，及法軍事代表在火軍上談判時的悲慘，續了便入氣愼塡　，而令人資惕的。這工作織續了一年半之久。</p>
<p>就是匪刋。　由談和春秋，也在整個編輯方針下，作了不少的工作。刋載短小精悍的文字，暴露敵寇和漢奸們的罪行，盡譏諷斥責的能事。譬如在民國三十年的雙十節，出了一期特刋，執筆者都是知名之士（但均改用筆名），每一篇內容，都含有看深厚的意義，和無限的期望。「正視現實」一文，就是根據總裁文吿中規勉全國同胞要「正視現實　一而寫的。</p>
<p>總之，申報盡量地利用機會，來發揮抗戰的意識，凡是有關係的消息，和足以利用的材料，抓住以後，決不輕易放棄。在危疑震撼的局面下，這樣是很容易賈禍的。最初，工部局設置了新聞檢查的機構，但當時敵人尙畏忌英美勢力，不敢作過份的要求，所以還不算十分嚴密。時局推移，敵人在租界的勢力日漸地伸張，態度也一天强硬一天。迨汗逆抵滬，沐猴而冠準備登台，對新聞界的壓迫，漸趨加重。極司非而路七十六號僞「特工總部」成立，歹徒們公然在租界內開槍捉人，除了抗日份子以外，凡在社會上稍有聲望地位，而不甘同流合汚的人，都是他們的目標。租界中造成了暗無天日的恐怖局面，新聞記者們人人覺得自危。</p>
<p>民國二十九年的夏天，大家傳說一張八十三名抗日份子的黑單，申報館職員中，就有十餘人之多。最初以爲是恫嚇性質，後來風聲漸漸地緊張，八十三名被「通緝」的人，開始有人狙擊，於是人心惶惶然了。報館的門口戒備嚴重，工作人員也遷入館內居住，以免往返時發生危險。</p>
<p>從廿九年七月，到三十年十二月珍珠港事變發生止，這一年半的時間，經常在緊張，恐怖的氛圍中。據各方面的調查，那時僞「特工總部」首先要對付由報，因爲如果使申報屈服了，其他各報便容易調度。申報站在這首當其衝的地位，開始遭遇敵僞的陰謀和暗算。僞方見「通緝」的人，深居簡出，而報館大門戒備又如此嚴密，一時無從下手，於是想出另一條毒計。廿九年四月五日，申報的王堯欽先生被幾個聲勢汹汹的無賴，從家裏綁架而去。他們用威脅的方式，要王先生打電話給被「通緝」的人，邀到秘密地方去吃飯，以便一網打盡。王先生斷然地拒絕了，並且說：「我年紀活到六十多歲，已經够了，如果爲了正義而死，也是光榮的犧牲……」</p>
<p>同在這時候，黃炎卿先生，又在另一處被逮捕了，但一句話也問不出。隔了不久，企圖綁架陸以銘先生，陸先生事前得知避開了。於是他們採用人質的方式，將陸先生七十幾歲的老母，十幾歲的小孩，一家全都拖了去。但仍是一無結果，奸僞們枉費一番心機罷了。</p>
<p>敵僞一計不遂，一計又生。他們採用暗箭傷人的方法，擲手溜彈，放定時炸彈，使人防不勝防。民國二十九年七月十六日的淸晨，暴徒以手溜彈一枚，從本報窗口擲入，一時烟霧瀰漫，彈片四射。職員石征鴻，工友王安陸等五人受傷，王安陸因受傷過重，不久殞命。當暴徒在窗口擲彈之際，後在門外投擲兩彈，無辜路人中彈片受傷者，至十四人之多。這是申報受奸僞襲擊的第一次。</p>
<p>這次事件發生後，非特名列黑單的人有危險，其他職工，也覺得惴惴不安。不過大家激於正義，並不怕敵偽的畏脅，仍繼續地奮鬥。館方則加緊戒備，還是很鎭定地照常進行。在第一次投彈之後，不久第二次又發生了。在一個初秋的黃昏，僞「特工」共投了三枚炸彈　不但不曾傷害一個人，反追獲了一個暴徒。經審訊後，已確實供明其爲七十六號所指使的。</p>
<p>在民國三十年年初，爲了僞「中央儲備銀行」的事，又接連被投擲了兩次炸彈。民國廿九年十二月三十日，僞「中央儲備銀行」開慕的前夕，申報判出一篇「中日貨幣戰」的座談會紀錄，揭發敵人的金融陰謀和僞幣窘態，大爲漢奸們所憤恨，至一月四日下午，申報門口的人行道上發現了三枚手溜彈，幸而未曾爆炸。後來，偽「中央儲備銀行」送來一大幅開幕廣告，要求於開幕之日刋出，經報館當局拒絕了。在一月六日黃昏，又有第四次投擲炸彈之事。暴徒一共投了三彈，祗有一彈爆炸，速累了四個路人受傷。</p>
<p>另外還有兩次，奸僞秘密地將炸彈帶了進來。一次放在編輯部的書櫉中，一次在圖書室的書架上，把四五本西裝書挖空了，放入一枚定時炸彈。幸而炸彈並不高明，早已失去了時間性，否則爆炸起來，危險性更大。這是民國二十九年夏秋之間的事。</p>
<p>在這樣鳥烟瘴氣的環境，又是風雨如晦的時候，新聞記者的生命，眞有朝不保夕之勢，申報記者金華亭先生，就在這時期之下犧牲了　三十年二月二日黎明四時，金先生經過愛多亞路大華舞廳附近，預館僱汽車回報館。恰巧汽車行的車子，全部出差去了，他只好在那裏徘徊等候。不料暴徒已伺伏在他的左右，立刻向他包圍襲擊。金先生因爲環境惡劣，而工作上又必需外出，所以他也置備手槍，以防意外。但那時猝不及防，未將手槍取出，而暴徒已連發數槍。金先生中了四彈斃命。</p>
<p>事後調查，金先生致死的原因，就是爲了僞「中央儲備銀行」的廣吿。當僞「中央儲備銀行」第二次廣吿來的時候，申報和新聞報商酌拒絕的辦法。金先生在旁表示憤慨詳細分析必須拒登的理由。報館當局聽了他的理由，便毅然地退回了，這事爲僞「特工」的情報員探悉，把一切拒登的責任，完全推到金先生的身上去，終於在奸僞的魔掌下，殉職了，殉國了。這種成仁取義的精神，令人欽佩，其英名將永留於史册而不朽。記得金先生遇難前的一星期，和同事們閒談中設：「我子女幼小，萬一遭逢不測，他們將如何生活」？可知他的內心如何苦悶。而這一句話，也竟成了他的識語。</p>
<p>在這時期中，還有一件工作，是値得一提的，那就是助學金運動的開展。助學金運動，本和報紙無關的。但報館本身是一種社會事業，應該爲大衆服務。過去申報辦了許多文化事業，發生了許多作用。當時在那暗無天日的上海，更需要這一類的工作。</p>
<p>這件工作的發軔，可以說是很偶然的。二十九年夏天一個貧苦的孩子，欠繳學費，迨學期結束，尙無法歸還，校長便向法院起訴。新聞刋出後，許多熱心的人，紛紛自動地送錢到報館裏，請求轉交給那學生。第一天就收到一千餘元，，三天之中，所收到的捐款，計算起來，可以供那孩子讀到中學畢業。於是便通知他的家長，領着孩子和他的成績單到報館裏來談話。成績果然不錯，把款子交了他，將收據製版，次日在報上登出。這一段因緣，引起了報館同人舉辦助學金運動，</p>
<p>三十年夏，開始辦理「申報讀者助學金」，全館職員，分別來担任各項工作，另外成立了一個委員會，來主持這件事。助學金運動展開後，博得社會的同情，捐款紛紛而來，大半的捐款，是小市民用汗血換來的錢，節衣縮食省下來，這是更可珍視的。</p>
<p>報館方面，根據「純潔」和「簡單」兩項原則，來辦理這捐款，對於由請人的家庭狀况，學業成績和操行，是特別重視的，可說是審核時的主要依據。</p>
<p>自三十年夏季開始，展開了助學金運動以後，那一年暑假，帮助了許多苦學生。迨太平洋事變發生後，報紙已受敵僞的統制，不能再充分發揮宣揚國策的職權。於是將更大的精力，放在助學金運動上面。從三十年夏開始，迄三十四年爲止，前後歷時四年半，申報共收到的捐款，約有四千餘萬元。被資助的大中小各級學生，在兩萬人以上。這一件偉大的義舉，在報館和讀者共同努力之完成了，它顯示了人類互助的力量，發揮了崇高的服務精神</p>
<h3>記美查</h3>
<p>美查是申報的創辦人。一入七一年，他和友人伍德華，潑萊依，瓦其洛，合費來辦一張華文報，每人出銀四百兩，共一千六百兩。即在那年五月十九日簽訂合夥契約，這是申報歷史上第一種重要文件。老　雖有四個，而美查却是其中的要角。辦申報的主張，也由他創義的，開辦以後，他還担任了第一任的主持人。</p>
<p>美查名安納期脫，在同治初年，和他的哥哥腓爾特力克到中國來經商，販賣洋布和茶葉。慢慢地學會了中國語言文字，對於中國情形，也更熱悉了。有一年，經營虧本，對於本業很灰心，有改行的意思。這時上海新報的銷路很好，美查的買辦陳莘庚建議辦報，美查也表示贊同。於是一面和他的友人商議，一面聘錢昕伯到香港去調查報業情形，作爲借鏡。所以本報創刋時，是倣效香港報紙的。在創刊號中，還有這樣一段文字：「新聞紙之製，創自西人，傳入中土。向見香港唐字新聞，體例甚善，今仿其意，設申報於上洋。」　美查是個很公正明達的人，他雖是英人但申報的言論，却並不偏袒英國。他說：「這報是供華人看的，文字應該從華人方面說想。」他很想使中國趨向現代化，有時他自己也撰寫社論，竭力鼓吹。他實在是中國的好友，可惜那時的風氣蔽塞，曲高和寡，沒有引起計會上的注意。</p>
<p>美查主持申報，營業蒸蒸日上，於是又辦點石齋印書局，及江蘇藥水廠，事業日益開展。他哥哥所經營的茶業，也轉機了，每年都有盈利。那時上海的外僑還不多，他們兄弟兩人，很爲僑商們所器重，安納斯脫美查曾被推爲工部局董事。</p>
<p>一八八九年，美查兄弟忽起思鄕之念，準備返國。於是將他們所經營的事業，改組爲美查兄弟公司，包括江蘇藥水廠，燧昌自來火局，申昌書局，及本館，全部資金三十萬兩，分作六千股，美查兄弟收回原本，折合股票二千股，航海返國。</p>
<p>美查夫人是酒吧間主人的女兒，婷婷玉立，容貌昳麗，是西僑女子中最漂亮的一個。英國風俗，仍軍閥閱，認為開酒吧間的，不會是上流人物。獨有美查，却鍾情於他的女兒。那時許多朋友都勸他，也有許多人譏笑他，但他都置諸不　。</p>
<p>在泥城外，有個西僑所組織的俱樂部，名曰「萬國總會」，入會資格很嚴，會員都是知名之士，美查也是會員之一。後來因爲他戀戀於酒吧間主人的女兒，竟被取銷了會員資格。可是美查絕不介意，仍舊經營他的事業，每天公畢返家，事受他的溫柔艷福，外界的宴遊酬酢，都謝絕了。這樣過了三年有餘，事業日見發展。僑商對於美查本來是很信仰的，雖三年不相往來，反而較前更為尊敬。三年以後，萬國總會重邀美查入會，他只付諸一笑而已。</p>
<p>一九〇八年，美查在英病故，事年七十餘。本報在那年三月廿八日接到電耗，對於這位創業者的舊勞，十分悼念。便在三月廿九日的報紙上，刋行了一段美查事略。</p>
<h3>本報出版事業回顧（上接十九版）</h3>
<p>申報月刋</p>
<p>二十一年七月十五日創刋的</p>
<p>「申報月刋」，雖是爲了紀念本報六十週年，但是本報對於這個刋物的期望很大，在月刋的創刊詞裏面有：「使本刋成爲學術文藝界一個公共園地，成爲各家作品和一般讀者自由的聯絡機關，實爲我們的心願。」</p>
<p>月刋的旨趣內容。以闡明國際形勢，論述國內時事，介紹學術思想，提倡生產事業爲主。由於執筆者的努力，出版之後，的應獲得各界的贊譽。</p>
<p>爲了編輯方針改變，決定改出週刋，於是二十四年十二月十五日出版的「申報月刋」第四卷第十二號，乃最後的一期。</p>
<p>申報年鑑</p>
<p>一自統計一家昌明，統計之術　進，人羣進化之事，社會變遷之跡，可藉數字表格，以見其眞實面目。西諺有云：「數字不造證語」。統計之足　，蓋駕文字紀載面上之也。結集各種統計，以供按索，爲年鑑之職查。　之，本館於日報月刋之外，乃復有年凖之繼轉。」</p>
<p>上面一段，錄二十一年十二月出版「申報年鑑」第一卷卷首「發行年鑑之旨趣」中的幾句話。年鑑共出四卷，在二十五年後停止。</p>
<p>申報週刋</p>
<p>注重一週間時事問題的解釋與記述的「申報週刋」，是繼承決定停版的「申報月刋」，而在二十五年元旦問世的，這個週刋逢星期日出版，隨報附送，銷路更爲普遍，直至全面抗戰發生，週刋也不得不停止。</p>
<p>申報月刊社業書</p>
<p>申報月刋社編輯發行的業書，共十一種，第一種爲翁照垣將軍所著的「淞滬血戰回憶錄」，列於二十一年十一月，曾經三版，第二種是「蘇聯研究」，依次爲：「人豐美之研究」，「創作小說選初集」，「中國經濟概况」，「贛皖湘鄂視察記」，「創作小說選二集」，「中國經濟現勢講話」，「印度叢談」，「小品文選」，和「杶廬所聞錄」等</p>
<p>申報業書</p>
<p>申報業書由「上海文庫」編輯，本報發行，從二十二年六月開始，陸續縱印，其中大部屬於國　淸勢以及世界知識關於日本和蘇聯的最多，計有：「日本戰時經濟」，「日本的陸軍」，「日本的海軍」，「日本的航空」，「日本的軍需工業」，「日本現狀論」，「日本現代人物論」和「蘇聯第二次五年計劃」，「蘇聯婦女生活」，「蘇聯農業五年計劃」，「蘇聯的敎育」，「蘇聯現狀論」，「俄羅斯歷史大綱」，「蘇聯憲法淺說」，「蘇聯經濟概論」，「蘇聯十二種研究」；關於戰爭與軍備的也有：「新兵器（上編）」，「列强軍備比較論」，「戰爭論」，「歐美的航空」，「空中戰」和「美日蘇三國軍備」等多種；其餘爲：「申報讀者顧問集」，「計劃經濟學大綱」，「現代電影論」，「無綫電讀本」，「少年人」，「美國戰時經濟計劃」，」世界經濟會議」，「西北視察記」，「國恥演講集」，「德國往那裏去」，「大南洋論」等，總數達四十種之多。</p>
<p>編制地圖</p>
<p>本報編製地圖的建議，創自丁文江先生，得本報故總理史量才先生的贊許，丁先生便約其同志翁先生文灝，曾先生世英，自十九年冬始編，其間且編且製版，至二十二年冬，全圖始吿究成，刋印地圖兩種：</p>
<p>（甲）中華民國新地圖——二十三年四月二十日出版，八開大本，精裝一巨册。內容分爲：政區總圖，地文總圖，交通總圖，氣象分圖，城市總圖，語言總圖，礦產分圖，農產分圖，各雀人文圖，各省地文圖，重要城市圖，鐵路道里表。且有五個優點：（一）徵中外往篇，廣諮世界專家，新測定經緯度數。（二）依據各省測量局，鐵路局，水利機關等各種實測地形圖，前後參考共達七八千幅。（三）就地形高下，分層設色。（四）參外國所製地圖千五百餘幅，糾正歷來各本錯誤不少。（五）全圖用多圖錐及亞爾爾斯二種投影法繪製，地名另編部首索引，四角檢字索引及羅馬拼音索引，以便檢閱。</p>
<p>（乙）中國分省新圖——二十二年八月十六日出版，本圖實爲前者的雛形，因爲前者篇幅較巨，價値較昂，所以商由原編製者丁，翁，曾三先生縮製此圖，供給學校靑年和一般國民採用。</p>
<p>上述的兩種地岡，都成爲興地參考書的精品，也可以說是紀念本報六十周年當時重大貢獻之一。</p>
<p>兒童讀物</p>
<p>鑒於兒童敎育對於國家的重要性，本報遂又致力於兒童讀物的出版。從二十四年四月兒童節開始，本報除每節輯印兒童節紀念册外，更將刊登本報的兒童週刊彙編印成「兒童之友」單行本，每年一葉，共出三集，至全面抗戰發生後，暫吿停止。</p>

<h3>七十五年來：本報的廣告發行及其他</h3>
<p>一·廣告</p>
<p>到現在，廣吿和新聞紙已有着不可分離的關係；任何報紙，必須以廣吿的收入，爲其維持生命的最大要素。但是一般商店把廣吿不掛在自己門前，而登在新聞紙上，其歷史並不太長久。中國最早的報紙——察世俗每月統計傳，沒有廣吿是不必說了；就是後來出版的幾種報紙，主持者也不曾想到利用報紙的地位刋登吿白，來作爲報館的收入的念頭。究竟在什麼時候，報館裏的先生們，忽然想起招登廣吿了？這問題不在本文所討論之列。但是，當七十五年以前，申報在上海創刋的時候，報上已經發現有廣吿的存在了。</p>
<p>第一號申報的「本館條例」中，便有着如下的」廣吿刋例」</p>
<p>「如有招貼吿白貨物船隻經紀行情等款，願刋入本館新報者，以五十十字爲式，買一天者取資二百五十文；倘字數多者，每加十五字照加錢五十文。買二天者取錢一百五十文，字數多者每加十字照加錢三十文起算。如有願買三四天者，該價與第二天同」。</p>
<p>從這條「廣吿刋例中，可以看到第一，「買」一天和「買」二天的廣吿費不同，而且相差頗鉅。這在報館當局，當然是一種鼓勵客户多「買」幾天的方法，爲報館本身的收入上打算。第二，從這條例中看，那時的廣吿費，實在非常便宜。因爲當時一般人對報紙還相當隔胰，對於在報紙上「買」廣吿這回事，根本就有點「莫明其妙」，究竟在報上登了廣吿，對自己有什麼效力，大家還是不大淸楚，所以申報當局便將廣吿費特別降低，用資鼓勵。</p>
<p>但是，上面的廣吿刋例只限於國人，對於外國人及洋行等來「買」廣吿，便不適用了。大概中報主人，認爲對碧眼兒不必再將廣吿費降低，來「用資鼓勵」吧，因此對西人所定的廣吿刋例，便相當苛刻，同樣每五十字，却要取大洋一元，侮加一字加洋一分，比起國人刋登廣吿費用，高起四倍，並且要「先收刋資」，「只限一天」，如果要多」買」幾天，則「本報因限於篇幅，該價另議」。</p>
<p>這裏，我們想提起當時一般廣吿的形式。毫無疑問，當時的編排法，，毫不州請究，刋登廣吿的人，也決不會讀過「廣告心理學」，知道什麼刺激反應的作用！—，商店中只擬了一篇底稿，拿到報館裏，經編者加了一個標題，（像編新聞一樣），便登到明天的報上去了。雛期廣告的文字，千篇一律，除了一個標題寫做「賣洋肥皂」或是「賣洋貨」以外，正文的開頭總是」啓渚：本號發賣……一應供全，開上洋XX路第X號便是，如蒙賜顧者，請至小號面議，其價格外公道，童叟無欺」。末了加上一句「謹此佈聞」，再添上「X月X日XX號啓」便完了。</p>
<p>這樣的廣吿形式，差不多一直維持到光緒即位以後。但是在這幾年中，中報的廣吿業務，却有着長足的進展：第一，是量的擴充。當本報創刋的時候，由於社會人士不明自廣吿的效用，所以刋載在報上的廣吿，只不渦幾家洋行，和報館附近的幾家商號罷了，但一到同治十二年，廣吿的量就大有增加，當時本報每份八頁，而廣吿就差不多佔了後面的四頁，（那時的編排，新聞在前，廣吿在後）。因此到了同治十二年的十一月，把廣吿字體改小一號，以容納較多的廣吿。第二，是質的充實。報上的廣告，除了商店宣傳營業以外，聲明啓事，尋人吿白之類也有了。加以光緒元年，戲館漸開，彩票始行，這些廣吿，日益增加。第三，是價的調整。從同治十二年起，廣吿刋例定爲第一日取費每字五厘，第二日每字二厘半，中西一律，再沒有高下之分了。</p>
<p>嗣後三十年中，除了區吿客戶，已把廣告字旬改良，採用不同字體及圖畫，以引起讀者注意以外，其餘很少變動。光緒十三年起，廣吿刊例易錢碼爲洋碼，每五十字第一日二角五分，第二日至第七日每日一角五分，第八日起，每日一角二分半。廣吿的地位，依舊在新聞之未，客戶刊登廣吿，非但不「對號入座」，而且也沒有「花樓」「樓座」「前百」「後百」之分，上下一律，猶如觀衆在星期日去看早塲電影一般</p>
<p>開始改良，是在光緒三十一年。這時候，社會的風氣已比較開通，歐美新聞事業，也早已成熟，影響到中國的新聞界來，同時，申報主人也覺得這樣的廣吿排列法，太不講究，於是方才把廣吿刊例分爲「論前」「後幅」「長行」「短行」等幾種，價格也重行調整。這是一個很大的進步，實行的結果，到申報來刊登廣吿的大多特多，幾乎擁擠不下。光緒三十四年起，廣吿費不依每字計算，而像現在一樣按行計算了。這時，申報的發展一直很順利，廣吿也續有增加，同時又因新聞的擴充，從一大張而增加爲二大張，又增加到三大張，這樣一直到淸庭顚覆爲止。</p>
<p>民國創立，萬象更新，本報亦從事更新內容，擴大版面，對於廣吿方面，也有很大的改良。當時，論前廣吿（即封面廣吿）經常佔到二版半左右，後幅廣吿也極多，申報當局因此又闢了「中縫廣吿」，即在報紙對摺的「長方地帶」刊登，價格與封面廣吿相同，這在現在看來，不免「派頭奇少」，但是在當時，也算是一個創舉，目前一般小型日報，還是利用這種「中縫廣吿」的。同時，在評論版上端，另闢「緊要吿白」，因爲這地位雖然比不上封面，但是也相當顯著，並且註明「緊要吿白」四個大字，自然更能引起讀者注意，有許多商號，便在這地位刊登長年吿白，那時社會經濟，不像現在紊亂，假使換了現在，那麼也不會有任何商號在報上刊登起長年廣吿來的「棗舉」。　，從那時起，本報的發行和廣吿早奠定了堅固不拔的基礎，業務蒸蒸日上，始終領先。但是申報主人，目的也不是純在賺錢，對於社會服務，極其注意，因此有許多貧苦的民衆，要登一則啓事之類，本報時常允予免費，有一個時期，往往有鄕下來滬的民眾，在路上走失了自己的愛兒愛女，哭哭啼啼的到中報館來，請求報館裏替他設法找尋，爲了注重人道起見，本報特地在「緊要吿白」中，義務刊登尋孩廣吿，規定：「凡有貧苦之人來登尋孩吿白，概免取費；如有不識字之人，不能自擬吿白，本館亦可代擬。」</p>
<p>民國七年九月起，在每版沿邊上下，另闢狹長地位，作爲」特別廣吿」，凡登載於第一張第一二三版的，每一橫排，上端每日八元，下端每日六元，第一張第四版及第二張第三）張等，上端每日三元，下端每日二元，到這時爲止，廣吿的等級，無形中分爲五等：</p>
<p>特等（特別廣吿）</p>
<p>頭等（封面長行）</p>
<p>二等（中縫長行）</p>
<p>三等（普通長行）</p>
<p>四等（短行）</p>
<p>這種一特等廣吿」，在民國八年便取消了，四等廣吿也在民國九年取消。從民國十年四月起，廣吿刋例方才以每日每行計算，取消了從前「第一天刋費貴些，第二天的刋費便宜些」的老規矩。</p>
<p>近三十年來，本報的廣吿營業一直在不斷發展中。由於生活指數的高漲，其間廣吿刊例的調整，也不知繼過了若干次（尤以最近十年中爲最。）關於廣吿方面的改進和發展，有幾點可以特別提出來叙述：　、首先要提到的，是分類廣吿的刋載。關於分類廣吿，在歐美報紙，實行已久，但是在民國十年以前的中文日報，却還沒有想到這一點。分類廣吿的優點，不必我來說，大家都已知道，在千百條大大小小的廣吿中，讀者依據了分類部鬥，迅速地可以找到自己的需要的廣吿，這實在是最經費有效的辦法。本報有鑒於此，在民國十二年左右，特地闢了分類廣告一欄，後來申報發行本埠增刊，分類廣吿便刊載在增刊之上，當時分類廣吿分做這樣的幾類：（一）出賣，（二）收買，（三）啓事，（四）出租，（五）租屋，（六）聘請，（三）徵求，（八）待聘，（九）喜慶，（十）地產，（十一）房產，（十二）敎育，（十三）醫藥，（十四）尋訪。</p>
<p>這種分類廣吿，除了于子目有時略有更動以外，直到現在，從來沒有問斷過。</p>
<p>其次，是廣告地　的擴大。從民國十年到戰前爲止，本報經常出版三大張到六大張，還加上本埠增刊，汽車增刊，常識增刊，和每週畫報等等，其中廣吿恒佔十分之七左右，全輻廣吿，不足爲奇，即如天蟾舞台上演第Ｘ本封神榜之類，也在申報登了費天的全幅廣吿。戰後因爲紙張來源不易，篇幅不能隨意增加，申報當局採取精編主義，廣吿地盤自然也受了限制，但是經先進同人數十載之耕耘，本報的廣吿營業，早已樹立了百年不拔之基。</p>
<p>（下接第二十三版）</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<h3>七十五年來：本報的廣告發行及其他</h3>
<p>（上接二十二版）　二　發行</p>
<p>本報初創時，發行的手續不過是每天　人分送各爿商號，託其代售，此外由報館雇川報販沿街零賣。當時售價，零賣每張取錢八文，遠處發賣每張十文，這多餘的二文，是算作報版的飯錢的，各商號向本館躉售，則以每張六文計算，這售價若和現在比起來，眞是差得太遠太遠，約略佔計起來，七十五年來，本報的售價，至少已漲了二十萬倍以上</p>
<p>而當時的銷數，總共不過六百餘份，發售地點，大都在市區以內，也無所謂「發行網」。到同治十三年終，銷數增加了一倍，總數爲一千二百份：光緒二年五月時，又增加了一倍，變爲二千餘份；翌年，又增加了一倍，變爲五千份。隨着銷數的直綫增加！發行的範圍也逐漸擴大，起先在近郊各地，與各商店信局接洽，經售本報，然後在江浙一帶，謀取發展，到光緒六年時，依據本報記載，已有北京，天津，南京，武昌，漢口，南昌，九江，香港，安慶，保定，廣東，廣西，四川，湖南，杭州，福州，蘇州，揚州，寗波，烟台等各處，都有本報發行，外埠各信局—致代售本報，「發行網」的組織，雖不够健全嚴密，但着實算得相當廣泛的了。</p>
<p>當時本報的發行方式，除了太埠由專差送往各經銷處發售外，外埠全靠信局經手，因爲當時本報在外埠旣未設立分館或分銷處，寄遞的方法，也祗限於郵遞，因此在江浙等地，總要隔了一二天，才能接到報紙，而在香港，天津等遠的地方，則奉去的新聞紙，早已變成舊聞了，新聞價値自然大爲减低。直至光緒二十三年，始在各要埠設立批發處，長江各埠，趕早發出。使讀者能够當日見報。光緒三十一年起，開始在各地成立申報分館。目前本報在國內各地的分館，有不少還是在那時起成立的，到現在也有着四十年的歷史了。</p>
<p>報價的第一次調整，是在創刊後的第二年，每份增加二文，即零賣十文，外埠十二文，躉批八文，凡各省未立碼頭之所，報價以每年計算，每份每年大洋四元正。第二次調整，距離第一次調整價格，整整有二十六年之久（光緒二十五年），仍舊漲了二文，但是外埠却沒有漲，本外埠報價雙爲一律，不過寄往外埠的報紙，按照路之遠近，酌加寄費而已。第三次調整，是在光緒一一一十二年，將錢價易爲洋價的時候，本報定價改爲每份一分四厘，每月四角五分。翌年，外埠全年大洋五元四角，半年二元七角，日本全年八元四角，歐美各國全年十元八角。——這裏要附帶一句的，當時的申報已經遠銷日本及歐美各國了。</p>
<p>此後，報價時有調整，我們也不必一一列舉了，好在近百年來的物價，不僅是區區報費，每次所謂調整，總是漲，漲，第三個　漲。不過申報的漲價，除了紙價的上漲和寄費的遞加以外，篇瘟的增加是佔着很大的原因的，本報的篇幅，從一大張，而二大張，而三大張，而四大張，五大張，六大張……甚至於十大張，報價的調整當然是必然的。</p>
<p>我們再來談銷數吧，最初幾年，已在上文提及，爲了較易明瞭起見，我們姑且這樣來編一張表看</p>
<p>（年份）（銷行額）</p>
<p>一八七二年　六〇〇</p>
<p>一八七五年　一，二〇〇</p>
<p>一八七六年　二，〇〇〇</p>
<p>一八七七年　五，〇〇〇</p>
<p>一九一二年　七，〇〇〇</p>
<p>一九一六年　一四，〇〇〇</p>
<p>一九一七年　二〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>一九二〇年　三〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>一九二一年　四五，〇〇〇</p>
<p>一九二一一年　五〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>一九二五年　一〇〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>一九二六年　一四一，四四〇</p>
<p>一九三六年　一五〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>在一九二六年到一九三六年間的十年中，銷數始終徘徊在十五萬份左右，所以不列入表內了。（其中在民國二十一年（一九三二年）上半年度時，銷數一度超出二十萬份。）</p>
<p>隨後便是戰爭的到來，本報一度遷到漢口，香港出版，二十七年又回到「孤島」復刊，在孤島時期的三年中，因報紙言論的嚴正，銷數也是有增無已。雖然因爲戰爭關係，外埠的銷路不無影響，但是在江浙淪陷區內的民衆，每天仍舊能够倫偸地從上海來的貨販手中買到申報。</p>
<p>有話便長，無話便短。抗戰勝利，本報在滬光榮復刊以後，由於有着悠久的歷史與報基，及主持人與全體同人的努力，不數月即悉復舊觀，目前發行數額，日有增加，設駸然駕乎戰前的發行數額之上，而發行網，國內遠至西康，新疆等省，國外遠至紐約，芝加哥，柏林，倫敦，本報皆設有辦事處，經理本報發行事項，附圖足見一斑。</p>
<p>三　增刋</p>
<p>本報最初使一大張，自光緒八年起，始增京報附張，專記京都要聞，這附張發行得很長久，一直到光緒末年爲止止。宣統三年，因「世勢日進，人事日繁」，宣佈改革編輯方針，同時副刊「自由談」便於是時問世。民國六年一月起，在第五張另闢一欄，名曰「老申報」，載「四十餘年之回顧」，並摘取四十年所載奇文異事，及政治，風俗，詩歌，游戲文章等，以餉讀者，其後中止。</p>
<p>上面這一筆流水賬，約略地介紹了早期本報的增刊和專欄，這些增刊和專欄，以現代的新聞眼光看它的性質及內容，當然不能予以過高的評價。其中京報附張，只是抄抄諭旨，而早期自由談及其他增刊，也只是談談風花雪月，弄弄琴棋書畫，因之，這些增刊，是專爲一般士大夫階級而添設，而當時，申報也的確是士大夫階級的報紙。</p>
<p>但是，時代在不斷進展，士大夫們「嗚呼於戲猗歟盛哉」的文章漸被淘汰。我們這裏從民國八年起開始叙述：——當時正屆第一次歐戰以後，國人亟需明瞭新世界的現狀，國際與中國的關係，接着，轟轟烈烈的五四運動發生了，靑年人對於新智識的要求益形熱烈，同時，本市社會事業進展特速，地方紀事日益增多，由於這種種原因，本報乃增闢多種增刊與專　，以應各方面讀者的需要。</p>
<p>這以後，也是申報的內容急進膨脹的時期，重要的增刋有下列幾種：</p>
<p>甲，星期增刋民國八年八</p>
<p>月三十一日創刋，每逢星期日出版一大張，隨報附送。其內容爲刋載國際時事的系統紀載，和迻譯國外報章雜誌的論著和要聞，以補充每日國際新聞電訊的不足。其後在民國十三年秋，以江浙戰事發生，紙面緊縮，停刋。</p>
<p>乙，常識增刋民國九年六月一日創刋，以介紹各科新智識，培養健全公民爲宗旨，逐日發刋。內容有常　，經濟，衛生，科學，市政，禮俗，雜錄等門，每日並有插圖一幅，抨擊黑暗　力，提倡自由精神，極　鋒鋩，民國十六年三月底停刋。　丙，汽車增刋民國十年十一月二十七日創刋，得週出一大張，隨報附送，刋載提倡建設公路和汽車常識等的文字及新聞。</p>
<p>丁，本埠增刋本埠增刋係本報創舉，本報前經理張竹平述創舉此事之理由云：「本報百創發行本埠增刋，其目的爲便利本埠商業各界之委登廣吿，所以僅限本埠原因，一因內容限於本埠，（例如各種細且或當日賽會等），一因本埠廣吿價値較輕，外埠鈉數且兩倍於本埠，我即利用少納郵稅與少耗紙張兩點，直接給予本埠廣吿登戶以實質的利益，事實昭然，今同業且步武其後矣！」</p>
<p>本埠增刋於十三年二月八日起創刋，每日出版。其內容除登載上海各種社會事業活動的預報及紀錄，劇塲商店的廣吿外，自十四年九乃起，每日特闢「藝術界」一欄。</p>
<p>戊，圖書周刋民國十九年五月十八日創刋，隨報附送，廿一年淞滬戰興，暫停，廿三年三月十五日，改爲「圖畫特刋」出版，每週發行二次，至廿六年全面抗戰時停刋。</p>
<p>此外，民國十三年十月三十一日起闢「商業新聞」欄，同年十二月八日闢「敎育消息」欄，廿一年開第二副刋「春秋」。另外，申報月刋，申報週刋，申報年鑑，申報業書……等，相繼發刋，在中國新聞界上，形成最燦爛的一頁。這些，另詳「本報出版事業的回顧」文中，這裏不再贅述。其後，在民國廿四年，又有「科學周刋」「通俗講座」「醫學週刋」等出版。</p>
<p>戰後的情形，我想不再多寫了，讀者當可明瞭，附帶寫一點關於紀念節日的慶祝增刋吧，作爲這一節的結束。</p>
<p>第一次增出「國慶特刋」，在民國七年雙十節。</p>
<p>第一次增出「元旦特刋」，在民國九年一月一日。</p>
<p>第一次增出「耶蘇聖　特刋」在民國八年聖應</p>
<p>四　紙張插圖</p>
<p>早期本報，用國濟竹連紙，質薄而軟，受滋易破，閱報時必須正　危坐，小心翼翼，一不當心，便撕碎。但印在上面的字，　徵畢具，毫不損讀者目力。當時係里面印刷，每張分八版，每版長闊各約九英寸半。同治十三年八月起，紙張略爲放火，分上下兩排，中以鉛綫相隔，實行得只有一個月，仍舊改爲長行。</p>
<p>光緒二十四年三月起，改用有光紙，光滑不易受濕。宣統之年，方才改用上等新聞紙，同時版面加以擴大。——一直到現在　由竹連紙變成有光紙，再由有光紙變成白報紙，這是中報紙張上的進步。</p>
<p>銅版插查，刋於新聞中的，始於民國七年十月。附圖即爲本報有次登載的銅版圖照，爲「敎育部特派出洋學生全體攝影」。惟當時在新聞中插入銅版，可以說是寥若晨星，若以今“本報來作一比較，那當然不可以道里計了。</p>

        <h1>1947.09.20</h1>
<h3>Zhang Qun, President of the Executive Yuan, Arrives in Shenyang for Inspection; Song Ziwen Appointed Chairman of Guangdong Province; Lu Han Flies to Northeast to Console Yunnan Troops</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] After Zhang Qun became the President of the Executive Yuan, he embarked on his first inspection tour at 9:00 AM on the 19th. Mr. Zhang traveled to the Northeast by military plane, accompanied by Deng Youde, Deputy Director of the News Bureau of the Executive Yuan, Councillors Zhou Junliang and Fu Boping, and Secretary You Jianwen. Chairman Lu Han, who had recently come to Nanjing, also went to the Northeast on the same plane to慰問 the Yunnan籍 National Army stationed there.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Gan Naiguang, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, stated that President Zhang's inspection tour has two purposes: (1) to inspect the implementation of executive orders in various provinces; (2) to understand the hardships of the people in various regions in order to plan for relief efforts. Mr. Zhang will first inspect Shenyang and Changchun, then proceed to important areas in North China, returning to Nanjing in about ten days. After that, he will depart for Taiwan, Central China, and South China for a second inspection tour.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 19th] Zhang Qun, President of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shenyang by plane at 12:45 PM on the 19th. Yunnan Chairman Lu Han and others arrived with him. In addition to Ma Zhanshan and Zhang Zuoxiang, who welcomed him at the airport, other personnel rushed to meet him en route. After disembarking, Mr. Zhang had lunch with Director Chen Cheng at the Second Guesthouse of the 行辕. Lu Han was also present. After lunch, Mr. Zhang met with senior figures from the Northeast and spoke with senior 行辕 generals to learn more about the general situation in the Northeast. Mr. Zhang plans to stay in Shenyang for three days to investigate general administrative affairs and intends to inspect the mines in Fushun and Anshan before proceeding to Changchun. Mr. Zhang stated that he would adhere to the principles of "seeing more, speaking less, and eating less" during his stay in the Northeast to gain as much as possible. In addition, it was learned that Lu Han was invited by Chen Cheng to Shenyang to console and inspect the Yunnan provincial troops in the Northeast. Mr. Lu stated that he was here to take a look and brought mustard greens, canned goods, and other Yunnan specialties to赠与 his Yunnan colleagues. Mr. Lu will also visit the Jinxi area in the coming days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 19th] President Zhang did not come to Beiping on the 19th. According to sources, Mr. Zhang flew directly to the Northeast at a little after 9:00 AM on the 19th and arrived in Panjin at a little after 12:00 PM. There is still no definite news about when he will come to Beiping.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The ninth provisional meeting of the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 19th passed the appointment of Song Ziwen as a member of the Guangdong Provincial Government and Chairman. Luo Zhuoying has been assigned to another position and relieved of all his concurrent positions. It is understood that Mr. Luo will hand over on October 1st, and Mr. Song will go to Guangzhou to take office early next month.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Order of the National Government on the 20th: Luo Zhuoying, member of the Guangdong Provincial Government and Chairman, has been assigned to another position and should be relieved of all his concurrent positions. This order. Appointing Song Ziwen as a member of the Guangdong Provincial Government and Chairman. This order.</p>
<h3>President Zhang's Remarks in Shenyang: The Situation of Northeast Imports Exceeding Exports Must Be Improved; A Solution Must Be Found to Alleviate the Suffering of the People</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 19th] Zhang Qun stated at a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 19th: "The fact that I came to the Northeast on my first trip after taking charge of the Executive Yuan shows that the central government attaches importance to the Northeast and seeks to solve the problems of the Northeast. Recovering the Northeast, stabilizing the Northeast, and developing the Northeast are the unchanging policies of our country. All compatriots, generation after generation, will work towards this goal. In the past, the Northeast was a surplus area; now it is in deficit. We must urgently seek to improve this. I will also observe the actual situation of the people's hardships and seek ways to alleviate them. The unreasonable phenomena, such as transporting steel out of the Northeast in exchange for foreign cigarettes and the products of the Northeast Locomotive Factory being turned over to the Ministry without being fully utilized, must be carefully studied and improved. The situation is good after the implementation of the revised import/export and foreign exchange settlement methods. The export figures have increased, reaching over 37 billion yuan in Tianjin last month. Regarding the general election, the government has never considered postponing it. The Kuomintang has stipulated a bottom-up method for nominating parties. The Democratic and Youth parties are also processing it, but there is no ratio regulation. Our country's diplomacy has always maintained an independent stance and is not affected by the content of the Wedemeyer Report. For example, in the preliminary peace conference with Japan, our country mainly proposed that the two-thirds voting system of the eleven countries should include three of the four major powers. Regarding the veto issue, our country advocates that the veto power should not be used for suggestive cases, but it should be used for destructive cases. These two major issues are different from the United States and the Soviet Union. Regarding the issue of receiving Dalian, I firmly advocate sending troops there, because Dalian is a free port in terms of commerce, and in terms of national sovereignty, our army must go to receive it, but negotiations have not yet been successfully concluded."</p>
<h3>If the Veto Issue Is Not Resolved, We Will Not Participate in the Peace Conference; Foreign Minister Wang Talks About China's Stance on the Peace Treaty with Japan; Advocates Submitting to the Far Eastern Commission for Discussion First</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 19th] Chinese Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Shijie declared in an exclusive interview with a United Press reporter on the 19th that if the United States invites the eleven nations to immediately convene a peace conference with Japan, China will reject it along with the Soviet Union. Mr. Wang stated: "The reason why China cannot accept the US invitation is the same as that of the Soviet Union, that is, the US proposal does not include the veto power of the four major powers. China fought hard for a long time before it was able to defeat Japan. If the peace conference cannot guarantee its rights and interests, China will not be able to participate. However, the Chinese government intends to compromise between the positions of the US and the Soviet Union and requests that the issue of the peace treaty with Japan be transferred to the Eleven-Nation Far Eastern Commission for discussion. This suggestion by small countries is higher than the Soviet Union's suggestion of a four-power conference, because it allows more countries that fought against Japan to have representatives present. At the same time, the procedures of the Far Eastern Commission have long guaranteed that the four major powers will reach a consensus." He hoped that this suggestion would be accepted by Washington and added: "If the deadlock in convening a peace conference in this way can be broken and the peace treaty can finally be fully agreed upon, I believe that the world situation will greatly improve."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang predicted that this session of the General Assembly would achieve very little in resolving world tensions. The basic problem facing the world is that there is still no peace two years after the end of the war. The United Nations General Assembly agenda does not consider this issue at all.</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang's Speech in Chinese; Simultaneously Translated into English and French</h3>
<p>Representatives from Various Countries Listen Quietly with Headphones</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 18th] Foreign Minister Wang's opening remarks at the United Nations General Assembly today were actually the first important speech made in the Chinese language at the United Nations General Assembly. When Foreign Minister Wang stepped onto the podium, applause thundered. Representatives from the 55 countries immediately used headphones to listen to his speech. The speech lasted 15 minutes. Cameras, movie cameras, and television cameras all turned, and silver light shone. Because there were talents and equipment available in the venue, Foreign Minister Wang's English and French translations of his speech were simultaneously transmitted from the headphones in the two languages commonly used by the General Assembly. This was the first use of the new system this year. Any speech delivered in any of the five official languages of English, French, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish is simultaneously translated into English and French. Representatives can listen by wearing their headphones.</p>
<p>[Another Cable] Shortly after Foreign Minister Wang delivered his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, he held his first press conference. The Foreign Minister stated that China supports the US proposal and advocates that the General Assembly discuss methods and ways to assist Korea in achieving independence as soon as possible. Mr. Wang reviewed the Korean situation and stated that it is doubtful whether the General Assembly can reach a satisfactory plan to resolve the Korean issue. The key to resolving the Korean issue lies in whether China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union can reach an agreement on any plan resolved by the General Assembly.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The Foreign Ministry's Committee for Reviewing the Peace Treaty with Japan held a meeting at 5:00 PM on the 19th, chaired by Vice Minister Liu Shishun. Those present included Wu Dingchang, Hu Huanyong, Liu Keshu, Jian Guansan, De Bai, Yu Shude, Wan Can, Zhang Qingzhen, Liu Shidu, and Huang Zhengming, totaling more than ten people. During the meeting, they extensively exchanged views on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. They all agreed that if the Soviet Union does not participate, China should not participate either. Regarding the voting rights issue, most people believed that the "four-country agreement right" was the most appropriate. Regarding the survival of the emperor system, Wu Dingchang believed that the words "Emperor" were inappropriate and should be changed to "Japanese Emperor" or "Japanese King". In addition, issues such as reparations and armaments were mentioned, and the basic policies on Japan after its surrender drafted by the Far Eastern Commission were discussed.</p>
<h3>Proposals for the Peace Treaty Are Amended and Approved by the Resident Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The "Proposal on the Propositions Regarding the Peace Treaty with Japan" drafted by the People's Political Council's Research Association on Policies Towards Japan was submitted for discussion at the Resident Committee of the People's Political Council held on the morning of the 19th. It was amended by Secretary-General Bu Lizi and others and decided to be changed to a proposal. At the same time, it was decided that the preamble of the proposal could be passed. The wording of the latter part of the clauses still needs to be considered. Except for the first and second clauses of the procedural part, which were passed and published along with the preamble first and sent to the government for reference, the remaining clauses will be reviewed again. When the proposal was submitted for discussion, most of the councilors believed that the sentence "The signing of the peace treaty should insist on being held in Shenyang, China on September 18" listed in Article 14 was too rigid and contained sufficient retaliatory meaning and should be amended. It was then decided to change it to "The signing of the peace treaty should be held in China."</p>
<h3>Petrov Will Return to His Post; Sino-Soviet Relations May Enter a Better Phase</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Soviet Ambassador to China Petrov may return to his post in Nanjing in the near future. Our embassy in the Soviet Union has applied for his passport visa. The Soviet Embassy here has confirmed this today, but the exact date is still unknown. According to authoritative sources, as a result of paying attention to and adopting China's recent attitude and actions in diplomacy, the Soviet Union has a better understanding than before, and the excessive doubts of the past have been greatly reduced. The return of Petrov not only brings hope that some of the knots between China and the Soviet Union will be resolved, but also contains a very important significance. Sino-Soviet relations may enter a better phase, and close cooperation in some international affairs will promote friendship between the two countries.</p>
<h3>Guan Jiyu Will Be Appointed Vice Minister of Food</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 19th] Guan Jiyu will be transferred to Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food and will go to Beijing soon.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Food Adapts to Current Needs; Formulates Measures for Food Re-Export; Purchase by Food Merchants and Institutions Must Be Approved</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Regarding food management and re-export, the person in charge of the Ministry of Food recently stated: "In recent years, our country's food policy has always adhered to the principle of free circulation of domestic food in order to achieve the effect of mutual replenishment. Now is a time of mobilization and suppression of chaos. Military and civilian food are extremely important. To meet the needs, appropriate management must be implemented for the current food in various regions, and measures for food re-export have been formulated and approved for implementation. The main significance is three points: (1) to avoid food aid to bandits; (2) to prevent food from flowing out; (3) to strictly prevent unscrupulous food merchants from engaging in hoarding and speculation with their large amounts of capital. This year, the provinces along the Yangtze River have reported harvests, while the provinces in North China have suffered successive droughts and floods. The floods in Guangdong and Guangxi are also extremely serious. Relief for the victims requires food urgently. Most of the military food required this year and next year must also be prepared in the provinces along the Yangtze River due to the disaster situation in North China. Therefore, how should the purchase and transportation quantities be properly stipulated so that the producing areas will not stimulate food prices due to excessive purchases, the sales areas will obtain considerable regulation, and the military food supply will be guaranteed? The formulation of measures for food re-export is actually a necessary measure to adapt to the current needs. Legal food merchants only need to comply with the application procedures and the documents submitted to apply for the purchase of food, and they can be approved. If there are any illegal acts due to the application for the purchase of food, once verified, no matter who it is, they shall be liable for legal responsibility. If the municipal governments or institutions and legal entities of the north and south provinces need to purchase food from the provinces along the Yangtze River, they should also apply to the Ministry in accordance with the regulations in order to arrange it as a whole, and they should not send personnel to purchase from various places first. Moreover, all institutions and legal entities must entrust legal food merchants to handle the food they entrusted to purchase and transport and must supervise them to ensure that the food arrives and is used locally. Do not allow merchants to get rid of the old ones midway and make profits from them. Moreover, for the food that is handled, the next batch can only be started after the first batch arrives. The Ministry will only approve the shipment of the next batch of food after each merchant has sold a batch of food that has been purchased and transported by a legal food merchant. I hope that all sectors will fully cooperate so that the government's food policy can be implemented satisfactorily."</p>
<h3>US Criticism of China; Praised Excessively in the Past and Criticized Harshly Today; Foreign Minister Wang Says Both Are Excessive</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 18th] Since Foreign Minister Wang arrived in the United States, he has been asked by various parties for his views on the recent US criticism of China. The Foreign Minister replied today: "Both the US praise in the past and the US criticism today are excessive." At his first press conference for Chinese reporters, Mr. Wang recalled that five or six years ago, US public opinion and the people all considered China to be perfect and praised it excessively. At that time, China was actually ashamed of it. Now, most American newspapers and commentators are moving to the other extreme. The Foreign Minister hopes that Americans can view the situation in China with appropriate eyes and not change from one extreme to the other.</p>

<h3>Wedemeyer Recommends to Truman That the US Continue Economic Aid to China; The Investigative Report Is Forwarded by Lovett</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] General Wedemeyer arrived here at 10:38 AM on the 18th (0:38 AM on the 19th, Shanghai time). According to Wedemeyer's news advisor, Watson, Wedemeyer's recommendation includes a recommendation that the United States continue economic aid to China. The full text is very long, with thousands of words and many attachments. General Wedemeyer refused to comment when he arrived at the airport with his entourage. Watson also said that the date for Wedemeyer's audience with the President has not been set. The date will probably be decided after Lovett reads his report. So far, unless Lovett or President Truman decides otherwise, Wedemeyer can be said to have completed his mission.</p>
<p>[US News Agency, Washington, 18th] Wedemeyer's report was completed during his stopover in Hawaii and is likely to be submitted to Acting Secretary of State Lovett on Friday. Wedemeyer will then resume his position as commander of the Second Army (at Fort Meade in Maryland).</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] Wedemeyer arrived in Washington today and brought with him a complete report of thousands of words after his investigation into the facts in our country, as well as recommendations to Truman regarding the next steps the United States should take in the Far East. Wedemeyer refused to comment on his trip to China at the airport and left for nearby Fort Meade to resume his duties as commander of the Second Army. Wedemeyer is scheduled to submit the report to Acting Secretary of State Lovett tomorrow. The date of his meeting with Truman has not been set, but according to Wedemeyer's spokesman, reports to the President during Marshall's absence will first go through Lovett and then to the White House. It is rumored that Wedemeyer brought three large boxes of secret documents from our country. Wedemeyer's spokesman said that a large amount of information obtained from the investigation in China has been included in the thousands of words in the report and there is a huge appendix, so the report is quite long. The spokesman continued that unless Acting Secretary of State Lovett wants General Wedemeyer to return to China, Wedemeyer's mission to China can be considered complete after the report is submitted to the President. He declined to clarify whether the above can be interpreted as the State Department wanting Wedemeyer to return to China as the US ambassador to China.</p>
<h3>Conference of Councilors' Standing Committee: Chen Qitian Reports on Economic Measures, Plans Textile Industry Initiatives, Urges Coal Mine Resumption and Increased Production</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Economic Minister Chen Qitian attended the Conference of Councilors' Standing Committee on the morning of the 19th to report on the implementation of government policies, roughly divided into two parts: (1) Supporting private enterprises to increase production capacity, and (2) Encouraging international trade to earn foreign exchange and balance payments. Chen then elaborated on the coal mining and textile industries. Regarding the coal mining industry, due to the impact of the Northeast war, coal shortages have become widespread. He has discussed with the Ministry of National Defense to find ways to protect mines, and at the same time, discussed with the Four Banks Joint Office to seek loans for increased production and expansion. As for the current state of the textile industry, China currently has over four million spindles, but not all of them are operating. Experts estimate that 15 million spindles are needed to meet demand, so there is a significant shortfall. Furthermore, China currently only exports textiles, so the textile industry urgently needs improvement. In terms of supporting private industry, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has established industrial and commercial guidance offices in major cities such as Shanghai, Yunnan, Guangzhou, and Tianjin. It is planned that the survey of the overall situation and actual conditions of factories in major cities across the country will be completed within this year. Then development and expansion can be further sought. Regarding the allocation and supply of factory equipment, a general warehouse for factory equipment was established during the war, but it was abolished after the victory. The part of factory equipment under its jurisdiction was transferred to the Materials Supply Bureau, which was very inconvenient for manufacturers. Therefore, it has now been discussed with the Four Banks Joint Office to grant manufacturers more foreign exchange for the purchase of factory equipment to facilitate imports, and a factory equipment group has been established under the industrial and commercial guidance offices. Regarding the adjustment of the production and sales of yarn and cloth, the first step is to increase cotton production. According to statistics, this year's harvest has doubled compared to last year, from five million dan last year to eleven million dan this year. To meet the needs of the national population, there is still a shortage of one-third. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has established a cotton production improvement office, with 45 billion allocated for promotion and improvement, hoping to increase production next year. Secondly, regarding the price of yarn from the Central Textile Corporation, since the establishment of the Textile Management Committee, yarn prices have been subject to dynamic negotiation, so the current situation has improved. The third step is to purchase spring cocoons. This spring, a total of 270 billion was lent to purchase spring cocoons from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces for foreign exchange. Now the autumn cocoons are coming onto the market, and 133 billion has already been loaned, with 33 billion used to purchase Sichuan cocoons, and the rest for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] At the meeting of the Councilors' Standing Committee on the morning of the 19th, after Economic Minister Chen Qitian finished his report, councilors raised inquiries and suggestions one after another, which Minister Chen answered. It was learned from Chen's replies that: (1) The Ministry of Economic Affairs is formulating a five- to ten-year plan for the textile industry, and is also paying attention to the establishment of yarn mills in different regions (especially in cotton-producing areas). (2) The Beijing-Shanghai area needs 260,000 tons of coal per month, mainly from the Kailuan Coal Mine, which supplies about 100,000 tons per month, and the Huainan Coal Mine, which supplies about 40,000 tons. The rest is supplied by coal mines in Taiwan. The Ministry is currently urging coal mines along the Yangtze River that have not resumed work to resume work as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Chen Qitian Answers Various Inquiries: More Advantages Than Disadvantages in Trade with Japan</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] After reporting on the general situation of the Ministry of Economic Affairs at the Conference of Councilors' Standing Committee on the morning of the 19th, Economic Minister Chen Qitian answered inquiries from various councilors.</p>
<p>Wu Chunwu first inquired about the issue of trade with Japan. Since the initiative is in our hands, but according to the facts, Japan exports industrial products, while China still exports agricultural products, will we fall into the old trap of surrendering to Japan's aggressive policy (agricultural China, industrial Japan)? Therefore, should the opening of trade with Japan be reconsidered? Chen replied that the opening of trade with Japan is a fait accompli. We can only say whether to participate or not. If China does not participate, it will not have much impact on Japan, but it will have an impact on our country. The State Council decided to participate, and the Executive Yuan is only implementing the policy. The Ministry of Economic Affairs can only impose strict restrictions on management. Chen also believes that this is trade between Chinese people and Japanese people, not trade between Japanese people and Chinese people. The initiative is in our hands, and there are more advantages than disadvantages.</p>
<p>Xue Mingjian inquired about the reasons for the increase in electricity prices. Chen replied that there are three reasons for the increase in electricity prices: (1) General price increases. (2) The addition of machinery requires expensive foreign exchange, resulting in excessive costs. (3) Labor wages are too high. The government plans to set a standard for the prices of various public utilities and set prices according to the standard. The government is currently determining the standard and its calculation method.</p>
<p>Chen Shaoxian inquired that we need a lot of cotton, but it is best to develop and increase production as much as possible to achieve self-sufficiency. At the same time, he suggested that the government purchase Indian cotton to avoid a large consumption of US dollars. Chen replied that the Cotton Production Management Office will try its best to enable all cotton-producing areas in the country to promote increased production. Regarding the purchase of Indian cotton, the Central Textile Corporation has recently ordered a portion. Recently, it has purchased US cotton three times, the first time 40 million dan, the second time 20 million dan, and the third time 25 million dan. The reason for purchasing US cotton is that US cotton does not require cash payment, but is a loan, while Indian cotton requires cash payment. Regarding the management of the domestic textile industry, the Central Textile Corporation is currently evaluating the price. It has been decided that 30% will be retained by the state, and the remaining 70% will be sold. The method will be formulated by the Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises.</p>
<p>Yin Shuxian said: Wei Demai's criticism of the government is that it is incompetent and corrupt, and there are two examples to prove it. One is regarding corruption. When the Fuel Management Committee transports coal from Jinpu Road to Shanghai, it must pass through Pukou. However, it must be inspected at Pukou Station. If the inspection is delayed by one day, it will be fined. Therefore, the inspectors can arbitrarily delay the time. Those who are inspected are willing to pay various fees in advance to bribe and advance the time for fear of being fined. This is the first example. The price of yarn from the Central Textile Corporation is set at 500,000 yuan per piece, while the outside price is 1 million yuan. Even if foreigners obtain the approval of the Textile Management Committee, they must pay a package fee of 400,000 yuan per piece to the person in charge. This is the second example. Another example is the Three Gorges Water Conservancy Power Generation Plan of Saffani, which should be started immediately. Chen replied that he could investigate it, but there are already improvement measures.</p>
<p>Measures to Encourage Young People to Study Abroad: Decision to Submit to the Government for Reference</p>
<p>Postponement of Various Election Cases Reserved</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The Councilors' Standing Committee held its fifth meeting on the morning of the 19th, chaired by Jiang Yong. Economic Minister Chen Qitian attended to report on current economic measures and the recent work of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and answered inquiries from various councilors in detail. Then, proposals were discussed: (1) A proposal to request the government to encourage outstanding young people to study and investigate abroad to contribute to the revival and benefit the nation-building, which stated in the measures: "For self-funded students who have obtained permission from foreign universities and have been awarded scholarships or subsidies, regardless of whether they have graduated from domestic universities, the Ministry of Education should uniformly issue study abroad certificates so that they can go abroad for further studies." After discussion, it was decided to submit it to the government for reference. (2) A proposal to request the government to postpone various election cases. The original proposal listed two measures: (1) Request the government to promptly solicit the opinions of representatives of various countries by means of communication, and (2) Request the government to promptly convene a meeting of the Legislative Committee to discuss the issue of postponing the elections. The proposer, Cai Zhisheng, stood up and explained, emphasizing that the current period is not a suitable time and environment for elections. After the councilors spoke, they believed that the proposal was submitted too late. The government is already actively promoting election affairs, so it is not necessary to submit it again. It was decided that the case would be reserved.</p>

<p>[Our Weixian Dispatch, 19th] Since the Chinese troops recaptured Laiyang, the location of the Communist Bandit Jiaodong Military Region Headquarters, on the 18th, the bandit's one column, four newly formed divisions, and local teams, located in Jiaodong, lost their eastern heart and dispersed, hiding in the surrounding villages and adopting guerrilla tactics.

<h3>Chen Qitian Reports on Economic Measures, Continued from Page 2: Price Fluctuations in June, July, and August</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Economic Minister Chen Qitian reported on the price issue at the Conference of Councilors' Standing Committee on the 19th, giving a detailed analysis of the price fluctuations in June, July, and August. Chen first stated that the basic reasons for price fluctuations after the war were nothing more than (1) fiscal imbalance, continuous increase in currency, (2) production stagnation, lack of materials, (3) traffic disruption, stagnation of freight, and (4) rampant speculation, prevalence of speculation. This year's prices began to fluctuate in April. The short-term stability created by the emergency economic measures was completely shaken. It was not until mid-May that it began to stabilize slightly. At that time, the national average price was about 19.685 times that before the war. Chen then analyzed the price fluctuations in June, July, and August, saying that the price index for June was 2,564.256, which is the average wholesale price index of the six major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan (with the first half of the 26th year as the base period in June). In the first two weeks of this month, general prices continued to show a steady state. By the last week, however, waves arose again. Black market foreign exchange rose nearly doubled in a week, and various prices also rose sharply. In this month, the average increase rate of the six major cities compared to the previous month was 21%. The reasons were: (1) Loose monetary policy, abundant speculation, (2) Wages increased greatly due to unfreezing, (3) Cancellation of subsidies for public utilities, successive price adjustments, (4) The expiration of the US Import-Export Bank's US$500 million loan, (5) The emergency situation in North China, and the surge of speculation moving south. The price index for July was 3,115.492. The so-called July price surge was not as large as predicted. The reasons were: (1) The arrival of Special Envoy Wei Demai made the market psychologically believe that it was the prelude to US aid to China, and the Chinese economic situation could improve, (2) The US State Department issued a joint announcement that private trade with Japan would be opened from August 15, and cheap Japanese industrial products might be thrown into the Far East market to compete, (3) In early July, the "Economic Supervision Council" was established in Shanghai, and it was decided to set up investigation teams for gold, banknotes, cotton yarn, food, fuel, and edible oil to strictly enforce inspection work, (4) National banks and bureaus actively tightened their positions, and (5) The stability of the battle situation in Northeast and North China, and the return of speculation. In the first half of July, Shanghai's monetary policy was extremely tight, and prices had no power to rise. However, although other places followed Shanghai's lead, the rise was still very fierce due to the later response. The average increase rate of the six major cities in August compared to the previous month was 21%. The price index for August was 3,458.749. Although the price increase rates in various places were uneven, they were generally stable. The reasons were: (1) This month is the busy farming season, and the market is relatively sluggish, (2) The food harvest in various places is still considered abundant, (3) The government revised the foreign exchange management and import and export trade methods, and the market response was still good, (4) The battle situation in Shandong and other places improved, and (5) The outlines for the implementation of the suppression of the rebellion were gradually implemented, and the price control work was strengthened, and people's hearts were more stable. This month is only halfway through, and prices in various places seem to have an upward trend again, with rice, food, yarn, and cloth rising particularly sharply. The reasons were: (1) Wei Demai's departure statement showed that US economic assistance was still under consideration, (2) Japanese goods could not pour in and dump due to the strict restrictions in our country, (3) Bandit troops roamed Hubei and Anhui in central China, and speculation moved eastward, and (4) The official prices of British exchange and gold rose slightly. As for the two items of materials, yarn, cloth, and coal under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Minister Chen believed that the fluctuation situation since April was still relatively gentle compared to general prices, and both July and August showed a downward trend. As for the price of bituminous coal, the increase rate in July still exceeded that of general prices, but this was because the subsidies were canceled, so the rise was inevitably steeper. However, if the average price index of January before the implementation of the subsidies is calculated, it is still not seen to exceed general prices.</p>
<h3>Continued Mopping-Up in Northern Jiangsu, Zhang Xuezhong Goes to Lianshui for Inspection</h3>

Savani's part of the case was tried for four days from the 15th. Because the testimony of the main witness Tu Chonghai was contradictory and other witnesses failed to prove that Savani conspired with Arrey or got out of the car to commit the crime, the verdict was not guilty. Savani was overjoyed after hearing the verdict and saluted the judge to thank him and shook hands with his defense lawyers to congratulate each other. This criminal part of the absurd case of drowning two people has come to an end. As for the civil part of the compensation, a spokesman for the US military advisory group told reporters that the total amount of salary that the victims Wang Shouben and Lu Huatian (both military officers) should have received within five years will be paid, but if the amount exceeds US$5,000, it must be approved by Congress. This matter is currently being handled by the US Damage Compensation Committee in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Grain Merchants Hoarding and Raising Prices: Seven Grain Store Owners Detained, Temporarily Released on Bail After Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 19th] Recently, the grain price in the town has risen sharply due to the manipulation of unscrupulous grain merchants. Although the county government has stipulated methods to control the market, it has been ineffective. County Magistrate Xu Yuanruo, based on a secret report this morning that a large number of grain merchants were taking the opportunity to hoard and raise prices and privately transporting large quantities of grain out of the province, immediately secretly ordered the Food Bureau to send personnel to investigate and detained Zou Xinquan, Wu Bangjun, Ye Yinzhen, Xu Zhangsheng, Zhang Chengfu, Zou Fuzhi, and Cai Yaoqing, the owners of seven grain stores including Yongdasheng and Wu Changchun. In the afternoon, Deputy Director Yan personally opened a court for interrogation to thoroughly investigate their relief items and destinations of transportation in the past month. As a result, due to major suspicions, they were temporarily released on bail with substantial security to await punishment.</p>
<h3>Commemorative Ode for the 25,000th Issue of Shen Bao</h3>
<p>Time passes, articles accumulate, month after month, year after year. Since the *Shen Bao* was first published, to this day, it has reached its 25,000th issue, and in terms of years, it has been seventy-five years. This cannot be said to be other than a brilliant page in modern cultural history. We cherish it, we applaud it, and it has its own profound significance, and should not be silently glossed over. Seventy is the age of antiquity in a human life. Speaking negatively, it may inevitably verge on decline; speaking positively, it is just the beginning of joyful attainment. Having experienced richness, its grand aspirations do not wane; in facing opportunities, it goes wherever it is fitting. The *Shen Bao* is just like this! Throughout the seventy-five years of its enduring history, like spreading ripples, it has gained thorough insight and silently observed the vicissitudes of change. Its experiences and trials advance with each passing day. Now, with its ever-renewing appearance, it provides readers with the most comprehensive and fulfilling service. Ceaseless innovation dispels the feeling of decline, and profound understanding of both bitterness and sweetness expands the way to respond to events. This is what we find privately gratifying in addition to our joy and excitement. The fact that *Shen Bao* has been able to flourish and continue uninterruptedly is truly due to the support of people from all walks of life, the readership of thousands upon thousands, and the nurturing of painstaking effort, the unsparing irrigation, the diligent gathering of dew, and the spiritual and physical investment of its staff. They deserve undeniable credit for their achievements. However, by the universal principle of natural evolution, the new replaces the old, and the talented depart. How can anyone living under the heavens transcend this limit? Looking back over the past decades, many colleagues have exhausted themselves and passed away, or retired due to old age and illness. The positions of these gentlemen may be gone, but their legacies endure. If we wish to maintain the *Shen Bao* for eternity, we must follow the standards set by our predecessors. As we cherish the loyalty of our predecessors, we must strive to expand the *Shen Bao* even further. Bearing heavy responsibilities, it is not easy to attend to everything. This, in addition to our joy, is what we find alarming and cautionary.</p>
<p>*Shen Bao* was first published in the eleventh year of the reign of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty, which corresponds to 1872 in the Western calendar. At that time, the influence of European and American trends had not yet fully spread. The Chinese people's awareness of newspapers was mostly ignorant. Aside from official gazettes, the only newspapers they occasionally saw were the Chinese-language newspapers from Hong Kong. The *Shen Bao* was the first to formally publish a newspaper. Although it was in its initial stages and the scale was not complete, the clear layout was already noteworthy. Compared with the London *Times* of England and the New York *Times* of America, it could not be compared, but it could at least follow in their footsteps. The birth of *Shen Bao* coincided with a time of many troubles for the nation. At that time, the Taiping Rebellion had just ended, and rebellions in Shaanxi and Gansu were gradually being suppressed. Superficially, the Qing Dynasty seemed to have the potential for development, but in reality, it was already in an irreversible decline. Subsequently, diplomacy deteriorated, and domestic affairs became increasingly corrupt. One turbulent situation followed another: there was the Sino-French conflict, the Sino-Japanese War, the Hundred Days' Reform, the Boxer Rebellion, and the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion. The *Shen Bao* witnessed and chronicled all these dangerous and difficult times. News spread rapidly, and even the smallest details were recorded. It allowed people in remote areas to communicate through a single piece of paper, and enlightened and awakened the minds of the closed-off populace. This was the contribution of *Shen Bao* in its youth, and the achievements it attained before the Republic of China.</p>
<p>With the fall of the Qing Dynasty, a new political system emerged. With its spirit of continuous self-improvement, *Shen Bao* assisted in the establishment of political and educational institutions. It took the lead in promoting justice and freedom and used its substantial strength to assist in the establishment of political and educational institutions. The beginnings were vast and cannot be fully described. In the past thirty-six years, the times have changed, and there have been many periods of tension and relaxation. The *Shen Bao*'s reporters have always been able to distinguish right from wrong and clearly show their support, such as recording the failure of Hong Xian's claim to the throne, the failure of Zhang Xun's restoration, the collapse of the Northern warlords, and the success of the National Revolution. Its arguments were unbiased, and its language was standardized. During the sacred War of Resistance, in times of hardship and urgency, with repeated adversities and frequent setbacks, it suffered particularly great trauma and unforgettable difficulties. Fortunately, in the midst of national jubilation, it was able to witness the restoration of the country, and the *Shen Bao* also gained its new life. Time flies, and two years have passed in a hurry. Although post-victory China has not yet recovered from its wounds, and wars continue to break out, people throughout the country, under the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, are overcoming obstacles and working together with one heart, and it is expected that peaceful reunification will not be far off. With its long history, the *Shen Bao* seeks to promote post-disaster reconstruction, and should strive to be even more sharp and industrious so as not to fail the readers' trust and to fully perform the duty of a journalist. Taking this opportunity, I offer a piece of my humble sincerity, expressing our wishes and seeking correction from the readers.</p>
<p>First: Newspapers are tools for social education and have the function of subtle and gradual influence. The more advanced the culture, the greater the need for newspapers; the wider the readership, the greater the effectiveness of newspapers. Some people compare newspapers to the wands wielded by magicians, saying that they contain unlimited mystery. Others refer to newspapers as spiritual food, saying that they can satisfy the hunger and thirst for knowledge. The authority of newspapers lies in this, and the binding power of newspapers also lies in this. Because of its authority, reporting must be objective and truthful, and its authority must not be misused. Because of its binding power, commentary must be responsible and cautious, and one must not fall into bondage oneself. The news motto of the New York *Times* is: "Only what is worth printing is news." Bleyer also said: "Good news must be palatable to the majority of people." These are all valuable creeds and are very worthy of our consideration. *Shen Bao* has always adhered to prudence as its guiding principle and conformed to this spirit; in the future, it should adhere to its original position and never change.</p>
<p>Second: Newspapers are pioneers in promoting democratic politics and have the responsibility to guide society at the grassroots level. Our country's constitution has been established, and the general election is imminent. The display of the power of public opinion will become even more important. How to strive for effective performance and promote the realization of democratic politics is our pressing task. As for freedom of speech, it is certainly something to be striven for, but it also has its limits and cannot be abused. We firmly believe that the bad consequences of abusing freedom of speech are no different from destroying the true meaning of freedom of speech. The differences between these two should be clearly distinguished. We believe that the minimum belief of a journalist is: to appeal for those who have been wronged, to attack those who act arbitrarily and abuse their power, to ignore malicious slander, and to treat yellow journalism with contempt. We must use true freedom of speech as our standard and be the voice of the majority of good people.</p>
<p>Third: Newspapers advance with the times, and the world has the inherent ability to change. *Shen Bao* has been in the newspaper industry for seventy-five years. In terms of seniority, it is like an old horse, but in terms of ability, it can hardly be said to know the way. Therefore, we are determined to learn extensively and make progress and are determined not to be complacent and stick to the old ways. We will carefully consider the advantages of newspapers in advanced countries and the techniques they display and strive to learn from them. For example, the widespread distribution of communication networks, the emphasis on speed and efficiency in reporting, the constant improvement of printing, the effort to make layouts eye-catching, and the effort to achieve universal sales are all within our practical plans, with the aim of gradually achieving perfection. *Shen Bao* is one of the leading newspapers in the country, but compared with democratic countries such as Britain and the United States, there are still many things that are difficult to compare equally. Leaving aside other things, in terms of sales, the Chicago *Tribune* in the United States sells one million copies a day, and the Daily Express in the United Kingdom sells three million copies a day. Comparing them to us, there is a huge gap. However, we are quite confident that as a result of continuous efforts, there may be a day when we can catch up.</p>
<p>The reason why we do not hesitate to be so verbose is that seventy-five years is not a short period of time, and 25,000 issues is a considerable number. It is time to review and distinguish what we should have. Reflecting on the hard work of the past, we are all the more motivated to plan for the future! We always maintain a sense of caution, knowing that complacency is not a good plan. Let us take the 25,000th issue as a stage, then countless stages are still ahead. Mountain forests and distant roads, this is just the beginning. We sincerely hope to work together with our colleagues and earnestly seek cooperation from our readers, in order to achieve greater and deeper progress and to promote the boundless glory of the *Shen Bao*!</p>

<h3>Vyshinsky's Speech at the UN General Assembly: Directly Rejects US Proposals, Demands a Halt to Malicious Propaganda by Various Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 18th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, in his address to the UN General Assembly today, categorically rejected Marshall's proposal to establish a 55-nation Interim Committee on Peace and Security, denouncing it as a manifestly unconstitutional proposal designed to circumvent the Security Council, and declared that the Soviet Union would fight vigorously against the proposal. After urging the Assembly to take punitive action against non-compliance with its directives, including the presence of US troops in China, Vyshinsky also introduced a resolution calling for a ban on the use of atomic weapons as military equipment by any country. The resolution also strongly condemned war profiteers and called on governments to impose criminal penalties on those engaged in war propaganda. Vyshinsky also sternly criticized Britain and the United States, accusing them of violating the founding principles of the UN and in some cases of directly defying the resolutions of the General Assembly. He pointed out that such policies of using UN agencies as tools for individual selfish and narrow interests are sufficient to weaken the position and strength of UN agencies.</p>
<p>Vyshinsky's points are summarized as follows: (1) The British and American attempts to disregard UN agencies, to break away from those agencies to implement their political measures, this policy is contrary to the Charter and the founding purpose of the UN agencies, the Assembly should pay serious attention to the threat posed by this policy.</p>
<p>(2) The most important setback in the activities of the UN is the unsatisfactory state of the disarmament plan. Britain and the United States are unwilling to disarm and have obstructed the realization of disarmament in many ways. Foreign Secretary Bevin's recent statement can explain why the disarmament issue is in such an unsatisfactory state. The announcement of the issue of atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction is particularly worrying. The Soviet Union has taken various steps to resolve the atomic issue, but they have all encountered resistance. The main resister is the United States. Although the Soviet Union intends to have strict international control of atomic energy, it can never accept foreign interference in atomic energy production plants.</p>
<h3>Criticizes US Aid to Europe Plan, Firmly Upholds Veto Power</h3>
<p>(3) The Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe are both attempts to violate UN principles, intending to force other countries to accept their policies. The so-called US aid to Greece and Turkey is nothing more than a political weapon. The Marshall Plan for aid to Europe is an attempt to force European countries to rely on US monopoly capital, and is intended to form an alliance in Europe to oppose Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, dividing Europe into two major fronts.</p>
<p>(4) Marshall's proposal to establish a 55-nation Peace and Security Committee is an attempt to circumvent the Security Council and is a clear violation of the Charter. The Soviet delegation will oppose it. The Soviet Union demands unconditional compliance with the principle of unanimous agreement among the great powers. The Soviet Union will strive to uphold this principle, meaning resisting any attempt to amend the veto system.</p>
<h3>Involves the Presence of US Troops in China</h3>
<p>(5) The UN General Assembly should take action on the following cases of non-compliance: (a) British troops stationed in Egypt, Greece, and Transjordan; (b) US troops stationed in China; (c) Argentina's disregard of the last General Assembly resolution by sending an ambassador to Madrid; (d) South Africa's failure to submit a trusteeship agreement for Southwest Africa.</p>
<p>(6) The Indonesian incident can absolutely only be described as an act of aggression.</p>
<p>(7) The Iranian issue should be removed from the Security Council agenda. The retention of this issue by Britain and the United States is clearly for a special purpose.</p>
<p>(8) The accusations against northern Greece are groundless accusations.</p>
<p>(9) The United States' submission of the Korean issue to the UN General Assembly is a violation of the Four-Power Moscow Agreement.</p>
<h3>Implies the Soviet Union Has No Intention of War</h3>
<p>Vyshinsky said that the newspapers of some countries are already launching propaganda for a new war, especially the newspapers of the United States and countries subservient to the United States, such as Turkey, which have been engaged in frenzied propaganda to make public opinion support the outbreak of a new war. War profiteers are using fabricated news that the Soviet Union is preparing to attack the United States to stimulate the people, as a pretext for their own war preparations. The Soviet Union does not have the slightest intention of attacking any country, while some countries, especially the United States, have moved from a state of war mentality to taking concrete military strategic measures, including establishing new military bases, reorganizing their armies, expanding arms production, and improving combat weapons. Vyshinsky then questioned why the British and American Joint Chiefs of Staff are still maintained in Washington, more than two years after the end of the war.</p>
<p>Vyshinsky then introduced a resolution stating that the UN severely condemns the criminal new war propaganda launched by reactionary elements in some countries, especially the United States, Turkey, and Greece, which are disseminating various suggestive arguments through newspapers, movies, and public speeches. The UN believes that it is necessary to urge governments to prohibit any form of war propaganda, with violators subject to criminal penalties, and for governments to take preventive measures against dangerous war propaganda that harms the peace, national interests, and happiness.</p>
<h3>Why Doesn't the Soviet Union Set an Example and Withdraw Its Troops from North Korea First?</h3>
<p>Statement by UN Observer from Korea</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 18th] Ms. Yim Young-sin, a Korean observer attending the UN General Assembly, criticized Vyshinsky's speech, saying that in world history, apart from Hitler's masterpieces, it is extremely difficult to find a solemn diplomatic statement filled with such contradictions. Vyshinsky strives to demand that foreign troops withdraw from non-enemy countries. Of course, he specifically refers to the US troops stationed in China and other places, not to the Soviet troops stationed in North Korea. If, as Vyshinsky claims, the withdrawal of these troops would help to increase international confidence and build peace, then why doesn't the Soviet Union take the lead and withdraw from North Korea first? The Korean people unanimously believe that the Joint Commission has failed. In the two years after the so-called liberation, Korea's situation is worse than at any time in its history. Therefore, Marshall's efforts to put the Korean issue on the agenda are extremely justified.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] After US Secretary of State Marshall proposed that the Korean issue be submitted to the United Nations for discussion, various political parties and organizations here attached great importance to it. The Public Relations Minister of the Korean Democratic Party made a statement on this, saying, "The Democratic Party absolutely supports Mr. Marshall's proposal and hopes that the United Nations will resolve it satisfactorily."</p>
<h3>Various Reactions to the Soviet Representative's Speech</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 19th] Today it was learned that after Soviet Representative Vyshinsky delivered a long speech of 8,000 words at the UN General Assembly, fiercely criticizing the American "war merchants," US Secretary of State Marshall, after receiving advice from other key members of the US delegation, will continue to strive to establish a peace organization, regardless of the Soviet Union's firm opposition.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 18th] Representatives from various countries have different views on Vyshinsky's speech. A few think it is "vivid," most think it is "severe," and some see it as purely "propaganda." However, Vyshinsky's assurance that the Soviet Union has no intention of launching a war has been taken seriously by all parties. British Chief Representative McNeil said, "This is an interesting speech, but most of the citations and accusations are clichés." French Representative Parodi said, "This is the most severe speech. This is a very important meeting." The initial reactions from the US Congress came from members of the House of Representatives. It is said that this kind of speech is the ultimate in slander. Syrian Representative Gojeh said that this speech was "thunder." It is said that "the most important thing is the Soviet Union's assurance that it has no intention of launching a war."</p>
<h3>Greek Deputy Prime Minister Flies to the US</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 19th] Greek Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsaldaris is scheduled to fly to New York tomorrow to attend the UN General Assembly. The newly appointed Minister without Portfolio, Liberal Party member Mylonas, will accompany him.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Monitors Developments at the UN General Assembly; Molotov Meets with Stalin</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 18th] Foreign Minister Molotov went to the Black Sea area a few days ago to meet with Premier Stalin and has now returned here. Diplomats from various countries attach great importance to this, believing that Molotov is closely monitoring the various developments at the UN General Assembly. One diplomat believes that this General Assembly session poses a danger to the future of the world organization. The Soviet Union believes that the veto power is a tool to promote unanimous agreement among the five great powers. If it is to be abolished, it will cause danger. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to this issue. If this session seriously attacks the veto power, the Soviet Union will also strongly resist it.</p>
<h3>Representatives from Australia, Canada, etc. Criticize Abuse of Veto Power</h3>
<p>Australia Advocates for Drafting Treaties with Germany and Japan</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 18th] Australia, Canada, and South Africa all delivered speeches in the general debate of the Assembly today, criticizing the abuse of the veto power and supporting the US proposal to establish an Interim Committee of the Assembly, demanding that the Assembly be given greater power to be the final arbiter of international disputes that threaten security and peace. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt frankly opposed the veto power and enthusiastically supported the Assembly, which prevailed over the Security Council. Evatt called for the prompt drafting of treaties with Germany and Japan. Chinese Chief Representative Luo Longji stated that people around the world must choose between the United Nations and the veto power in its current form. If the application of the veto power is not properly regulated, then we may lose both. Luo also enthusiastically supported Marshall's proposal and supported the US decision to include the Korean issue on the Assembly's agenda.</p>
<h3>UN Special Committee on Palestine Scheduled to Elect Members on Monday</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 18th] The UN Special Committee for the Palestine question, which is responsible for examining the Palestine issue, is scheduled to elect members on Monday. Swedish Foreign Minister Undén is expected to be elected as chairman.</p>
<h3>Showdown Between US and Soviet Union Inevitable</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] Representative Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who was denounced as one of the "war makers" by Soviet Representative Vyshinsky at the UN General Assembly, said in a nationwide broadcast after Vyshinsky's attack: "A showdown with the Soviet Union is inevitable." Eaton, apparently unmoved by Vyshinsky's condemnation, urged Americans to make it clear that the United States is determined to defend its freedom and "do its utmost to help other people" maintain their freedom. Eaton said, "We believe that a showdown with the Soviet Union is inevitable for three reasons: (1) The world is urgently required to choose one of two incompatible philosophies of life. (2) The Soviet Union has an aggressive ideology, its avowed purpose is to conquer the world with world revolution, its motives are extremely despicable and inhuman, like a hungry tiger. (3) Communism delusionally believes that if the US free government system and free capitalist enterprises are not weakened, the Soviet system will fail. Sooner or later, we will confront the Soviet Union, the embodiment of communism, head-on, and investigate whether the two can coexist in the modern world." Eaton also said, "The United States has decided to maintain its current leadership position in the United Nations at any cost. This position will serve as the cornerstone of our foreign policy."</p>
<h3>If the US Proposal Passes, the Soviet Union May Withdraw from the United Nations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 10th] Representatives attending the UN General Assembly are today seriously discussing the possibility of the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the UN. Some representatives believe that if the General Assembly passes the US proposal to establish a 55-nation Peace and Security Committee, then it is highly likely that the Soviet Union will withdraw from the UN. At the same time, according to authoritative sources, the US delegation is prepared to implement this new Marshall Plan immediately after two-thirds of the members of the General Assembly pass the proposal, regardless of the Soviet Union's participation. American newspapers warmly defend Marshall's new plan, unanimously demanding that the General Assembly pass the proposal quickly, regardless of the Soviet Union's threats. When considering the possibility of the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the UN, the delegations of some small countries do not dare to express their views on this proposal before receiving instructions from their governments.</p>
<h3>In the Future, Battleships and Artillery Will Be Replaced by Rockets; Prediction in British Naval Yearbook</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 18th] The naval yearbook "Jane's Fighting Ships" 1946-1947 edition was published yesterday, in which it predicts that within the next one or two years, the position of the main weapon on the latest battleships, the 16-inch caliber artillery, will be replaced by rockets, and the United Kingdom is entering a new era of conversion to cope with atomic bombs. Construction of the US 45,000-ton battleship "Kentucky" and the 27,500-ton battlecruiser "Hawaii" was temporarily suspended, probably because it was planned to add rockets to the equipment.</p>
<h3>Indian Government Denies Discrimination Against Muslims</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, 19th] After Khan, the representative of Pakistan attending the UN General Assembly, stated that if the Indian government does not take steps to stop the killing of Muslims, Pakistan may appeal to the UN. The Indian government issued a statement today stating that it is prepared to have any impartial authority adjudicate Pakistan's accusations against India. The statement also denies Khan's claims that the Indian government is unable to fulfill its responsibilities, and states that the Indian government has never incited any ethnic group to use violence against violence. Mrs. Pandit, the Indian representative attending the General Assembly, also issued a statement to the press, stating that retaliation against discrimination is never the way to peace. The statement that India does not want Muslims in its territory is absolutely untrue. There are still 30 million Muslim residents in the Dominion of India, and the Indian government has no intention of relocating them. The Indian government's purpose in the immigration work is limited to the Punjab.</p>
<h3>Hata Shunroku on Trial</h3>
<p>Prosecutors Amend Indictment</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The Tokyo International Military Tribunal began the trial of Hata Shunroku on the 19th. The main points of his charges are: (1) He was the commander of the China Expeditionary Army and engaged in wars of aggression; (2) He planned and prepared for wars of aggression during his tenure; (3) He was one of the masterminds of the overthrow of the Yonai Cabinet. Hata's defender stated in his defense that Hata did not agree with the war of aggression and assisted Umeda Daisen in his defection. He also stated that Hata did not conspire to overthrow the Yonai Cabinet. The prosecutor in charge of this case unexpectedly deleted most of the indictment and only accepted part of it. Hata Shunroku is the most well-known Japanese war criminal to the Chinese people. His misdeeds and crimes during his time as commander of the China Expeditionary Army and his condoning of the brutality of the Japanese army are truly unforgivable.</p>
<h3>The Political Situation in Vietnam Turns Delicate: Political Turmoil Erupts Again in Cochinchina</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Saigon, 18th] The Cochinchina Council in Saigon today passed a vote of no confidence against the country's President, Lê Văn Vỹ, further escalating the political turmoil. The Cochinchina Council's resolution also addresses the Governor of Vietnam, Borel, regarding this dispute. The Republic of Cochinchina has been established for eighteen months. Some parties within the country are inclined to maintain the status quo, while others view the Lê Văn Vỹ government as an untrustworthy puppet regime. Simultaneously, according to French sources, Annam's Emperor Bảo Đại's agreement to negotiate with France offers hope for an early resolution to the Vietnam War. While French officials point out that Bảo Đại's declaration refers to Vietnam's "independence," and the French propose "autonomy," a gap exists. It is believed this gap can be bridged. Paris hopes Bảo Đại will formally engage in negotiations with France. French authorities may issue another statement encouraging the Vietnamese to support Bảo Đại.</p>
<h3>Severe Flooding in Japan: Tokyo Residents Evacuate</h3>
<p>Two Hundred Thousand Homeless</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] The Ministry of Social Welfare announced today that another 50,000 Japanese people have begun to evacuate the northern districts of Tokyo. Reconnaissance by the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division estimates approximately 200,000 Japanese are homeless on the Kantō Plain. Dikes have been eroded by the floodwaters and are showing signs of damage. Coupled with tidal surges, the city faces the threat of being inundated. Approximately 350 U.S. troops from the 11th Airborne Division in northern Honshu, stranded for four days and nights due to floodwaters while traveling by train, have returned to their base unharmed.</p>
<h3>U.S. Soldier Rapes Japanese Girl</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] The Gendarmerie Command announced today that a 14-year-old Japanese girl was raped by a U.S. soldier on the evening of the 17th in a park in the suburbs. Her injuries are severe. The incident was discovered by Japanese police, who reported it to the U.S. Eighth Army Command. The Command dispatched military police to arrest the perpetrator, who is currently being interrogated.</p>
<h3>Allied Officials: From Arrogant to Deferential</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] As the date for concluding a peace treaty with Japan approaches, the attitude of senior Allied officials toward Japanese government officials has become noticeably "milder." For the first year and a half after the occupation of Japan, relations between the Allied forces and Japanese government officials remained formal and constrained. This is gradually changing. The relationship between American and Japanese representatives has now evolved towards a more natural state, approaching a position of equality to some extent. This clear symbolic change can be seen in the demeanor of General MacArthur during his meetings with Emperor Hirohito in May of this year. According to sources with authority, in the first two meetings, MacArthur addressed the Emperor as "you," but in subsequent meetings, MacArthur consistently addressed Hirohito as "Your Majesty." The shift in the U.S. attitude towards Japan, from stern to moderate, began after the new constitution came into effect on May 3rd. A few days after the constitution was enacted, several senior Japanese government officials visited key personnel in the Allied Command. After the meeting, Allied officials, unusually, escorted them to the door, much to the surprise of the Japanese officials.</p>
<h3>Indonesian Army Launches Major Counteroffensive: U.S. Agrees to Join the Tripartite Committee: Cabinet Scheduled to Issue Statement on Indonesian Policy Next Week</h3>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 19th] The Republican gazette announced on the evening of the 18th that powerful units of the Republican army had launched a major counteroffensive from their base in the mountains of eastern Java, advancing towards the mountainous area 20 miles northwest of Malang. Intense fighting with Dutch-Indian forces occurred in heavy fog for ninety minutes, resulting in sixty Dutch soldiers killed and twenty wounded. Meanwhile, the two sides engaged five times in central Java and three times in western Java.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Flushing, 18th] It was announced here today that the United States will be the third member of the cessation committee handling the Indonesian issue in the Security Council. The governments of Australia and Belgium, attending the United Nations General Assembly, had jointly requested the United States government to serve as the third member of the mediation committee. With the United States' agreement, the mediation committee has been finalized as Australia, Belgium, and the United States.</p>
<p>[United Press, Sumatra, Padang, 19th] Representatives of the United Nations Consular Investigation Team from the UK, France, and Australia flew to Bukit Tinggi yesterday to conduct an on-the-ground investigation into the implementation of the ceasefire order by the Dutch and Indonesian sides. This marks the first visit to the area by European personnel since the outbreak of the Dutch-Indonesian conflict. The representatives originally planned to travel by jeep, but switched to a dedicated Dakota aircraft of the Australian Air Force due to road obstructions and landmines.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Sends Another Note to Iran: Urges Prompt Ratification of Oil Agreement Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 18th] Reliable sources state that the Soviet Union has sent a second note to Iran, sternly demanding that the Iranian parliament take swift action on the joint Soviet-Iranian oil exploitation matter and refrain from procrastination. The note was submitted to the Iranian government by the Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Sergey Kavtaradze, on September 15th, in response to Iran's reply to the Soviet Union's first note. The Iranian reply refused the Soviet demand for Iran to sign a new oil agreement with the Soviet Union without the approval of the Iranian parliament. The Iranian parliament currently has no intention of immediately passing a vote of confidence in the Qavam government. Without this vote of confidence, Qavam cannot request parliament to ratify the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement signed last year.</p>
<h3>Burma to Gain Independence Next Year: U.S. and Burma Agree to Exchange Ambassadors</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] The British Minister of State for Burma Affairs, Arthur Henderson, stated today that Burma will become a "completely independent republic" in January 1948. The Burmese Constituent Assembly will complete its new constitution for the "Union of Burma." At that time, the British government will sign a treaty with the Burmese government and will introduce the "Burma Independence Act" when the British Parliament convenes on October 20th. It is hoped that the legislative process for the independence act can be completed before Christmas, so that Burma can celebrate its independence by next January.</p>
<p>Having recently visited Burma to conduct an inspection, the terms of the treaty have been agreed upon in principle. The British government has appointed the current British Minister to Egypt, Gilbert Laithwaite, as the British High Commissioner to Burma. Later, Laithwaite will serve as the first British Ambassador to Burma. The situation in Burma is different from that in India. There is no transitional period of dominion status. After the transfer of power and the passage of the independence act, Burma will become an "independent and sovereign state."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] The U.S. State Department announced that the United States and Burma have agreed to upgrade the diplomatic missions of both countries to ambassadorial rank. U Thant will be the first Burmese Ambassador to the United States, and it is generally expected that Edwin Stanton will be appointed as the first U.S. Ambassador to Burma.</p>

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The silver shops in the city, which have been closed for six months, have been authorized to reopen and resume selling gold ornaments following the passage of a resolution by the Municipal Council yesterday. The official reopening date will be decided after the Social Affairs Bureau convenes a meeting with the responsible parties of the silver shop guilds on the 22nd. The selling price of gold ornaments is stipulated to be based on the exchange rate set by the Central Bank, plus an additional 40% for operating expenses (including chemicals, fire, labor, mold depreciation, staff commissions, public levies, packaging, coloring, advertising, stationery, operating expenses, and interest), and a 20% legal profit margin, plus a separate labor cost per item.

<p>Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, solemnly stated yesterday that although silver shops are allowed to reopen and resume selling gold ornaments, they must not take this opportunity to purchase gold bars or melt the gold ornaments they receive into gold bars.

<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The District Procuratorate has been holding hearings for days to investigate the case of alleged corruption against senior UNRRA officials, including Li Zhuomin and five others. A large number of witnesses were questioned yesterday. At 9:00 AM, Prosecutor He took the stand, first summoning Zhu Rushan, General Manager of Yutong Flour Company, because the company had a flour milling contract with UNRRA. He then summoned Wu Zhiheng, Manager of Zhiheng Pharmaceutical Factory.

After UNRRA's corruption was exposed, someone suddenly reported to the District Procuratorate that Director Hou had accepted a bribe of a house, specifying that it was related to Wu. Therefore, Wu was summoned to the court for questioning. Responsible parties from Fufeng Flour Company, Xi Debing, Pan Qiwen, Sun Zhongde, and staff members from Fuxin Flour Company, Liu Shouqi and Qian Shouchun, were also questioned, but the hearings were postponed to a later date.</p>
<p>The news of Li Zhuomin's preliminary suspension from his position has attracted great attention from all parties. However, according to a spokesman for UNRRA, the organization had not yet received any orders from the government as of yesterday. Li did not go to work at the organization yesterday.</p>

<h3>German Nationals Arrive in Shanghai Aboard the Wanyi Landing Craft and Are Permitted to Disembark</h3>

<h3>Universities Expedite Procedures for National Assembly and Legislative Yuan Elections</h3>

<h3>Municipal Museum Hosts Exhibition of Artifacts from Past Dynasties</h3>

<h3>Representatives of Hongmen Groups Express Their Regards to Situ Meitang</h3>
<p>Situ Meitang, a prominent figure in the Hongmen community in the United States, recently publicly announced his abandonment of the idea of forming a political party and his departure from the China Hongmen Minzhi Party. Representatives from two major organizations, the Preparatory Committee of the China Hongmen Global Kinship Conference and the Hongxing Society, including Cheng Zhuang, Zheng Ziliang, Chen Peide, Wang Zhiben, Wang Tiemin, Jiang Hao, Long Qingquan, Yang Wendao, and Shi Zhenjiang, visited Situ yesterday to express their deep admiration for his past contributions to the revolution. The Hongmen has always prioritized the nation and has a glorious history in the revolutionary cause. They promote justice and retire after success, fulfilling their obligations without seeking power. This is the consistent spirit of the Hongmen. If the original Hongmen organization were reorganized into a political party, it would lose the aforementioned meaning. If a political party were formed by some Hongmen members and named after the Hongmen, it would be even more inappropriate. Now, by abandoning the idea of forming a political party, departing from the Hongmen Minzhi Party, and striving for the overall unity of the Hongmen, they expressed their sympathy and extended their regards. Situ expressed his deep gratitude for the aforementioned goodwill and hoped that his Hongmen colleagues at home and abroad would continue to follow the original path, unite as one, and promote the early completion of the work of building a new China.</p>
<h3>More Than a Dozen Merchants Detained and Punished for Strict Market Control</h3>

They were each sentenced to three days of detention as a warning.</p>
<p>The Economic Section of the Police Bureau also detained five illegal rice merchants, Liu Bingzhang, Pan Guifen, Chen Qishan, Ye Bonan, and Zhuang Jingrong, yesterday in the north and south rice markets for not carrying market entry permits or for borrowing other people's permits. Liu Bingzhang was sentenced to one day of detention, while the others were each sentenced to three days of detention.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Response to Volunteer Soldier Recruitment: Expect to Meet Quota by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the recruitment of volunteer soldiers began on the 15th, as of last night, a total of 761 people from various districts have reported to the new soldier recruitment center. After passing the physical examination, 526 people have been sent to the Shanghai Garrison Command.</p>
<h3>Contribute Money and Labor</h3>
<p>The Publicity Committee of the Military Service Association held a reception for the press at the Municipal Council at 3:00 PM yesterday to report on the recruitment of volunteer soldiers. Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and Gao Baoshu, Chief of Staff of the Shanghai Garrison Command, also attended. Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Association, stated that since the recruitment of volunteer soldiers began, only a few days ago, the average number of people reporting from each district has been around 120 each day. Many did not meet the requirements but insisted on enlisting, and many donated their resettlement allowances to education, which was deeply moving. The enthusiasm of the people in each district in sending off volunteer soldiers was particularly evident. The city needs to recruit 3,000 people, and it is believed that the quota will be met by the end of the month. If the quota is not met, it will be collected by lottery according to law. During this period of total mobilization, all patriotic people should "contribute money and labor" and enthusiastically join the army or enlist. Central Committee Member Soong Tzu-wen donated all of his shares in the investment business of the China Construction Bank. It is said that Kong Lingkan, son of Kong Xiangxi, and other shareholders will soon take similar action, which can serve as a model. This is truly an excellent phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Oil Purchase Problem Remains Unresolved: China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) May Be Forced to Suspend Flights: Company Business Meeting to Discuss Proposals Starting Today</h3>
<p>In order to actively improve its business, the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) is convening a business meeting in Shanghai from the 19th to the 21st, bringing together all senior officials of the company and the heads of eleven major offices in Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Qingdao, Pan, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Calcutta. The 19th will be devoted to work reports from the heads of various departments and offices, and the discussion of business proposals will begin on the 20th.</p>
<p>According to CNAC General Manager Liu Jingyi's statement to reporters, the most difficult problem for CNAC to solve at present is the gasoline problem. CNAC's gasoline is supplied by British and American oil companies in Shanghai, so it must be purchased with U.S. dollars. The government has only given CNAC an official exchange rate of 500,000 U.S. dollars. Although the Executive Yuan approved this 500,000 U.S. dollars to be used for paying foreign employee salaries and purchasing aircraft parts, the Import Management Committee was supposed to allocate additional U.S. dollars at the official rate. However, the Import Management Committee has not yet provided a concrete response. CNAC is facing a major crisis with its oil supply due to the shortage of U.S. dollars and the prohibition of purchasing U.S. dollars on the black market. If a solution is not found in the next few days, CNAC may have to temporarily suspend flights starting on the 25th of this month. Liu added that even if U.S. dollars were obtained on the black market, the company would not be able to sustain itself due to its expenses exceeding its income. Otherwise, it would have to raise prices. However, an increase in airfreight rates would affect overall prices. In today's unstable financial situation, CNAC does not want to stimulate prices by raising airfreight rates. CNAC is continuing to negotiate with the responsible authorities, hoping to resolve this major issue as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Bai Lu Buried in Hongqiao Cemetery Amid Gloomy Twilight and the Low Playing of a Funeral Dirge</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The famous film actress Bai Lu, who previously died after falling down the stairs at the International Hotel, was buried yesterday afternoon in Hongqiao Cemetery. Before the burial, Bai Lu's relatives and friends held a public memorial service at the China Funeral Home. Tian Han presided over the service, and Hong Shen, Xiong Foxi, Luo Mingyou, Xia Yunhu, Bai Yang, and Wang Renmei were among those who attended. During the memorial service, Feng Zi gave a detailed report on Bai Lu's life. Tian Han and Hong Shen also delivered eulogies. Afterwards, Jin Yan, Liu Huan, Shi Dongshan, Shen Fu, Feng Zi, Pan Zichen, and others helped to move the coffin to Hongqiao Cemetery, where it was covered with earth amid the gloomy twilight and the low playing of a funeral dirge. This young artist has thus bid farewell to the world forever.</p>
<p>Bai Lu's two children, Anmei and Xiaomei, had originally planned to come to Shanghai from Hong Kong to see her one last time, but they had not arrived as of yesterday. Bai Lu's husband, Mr. Jiang, stood precariously in front of the grave for a long time, unwilling to leave. A few bouquets of flowers and a mound of yellow earth were enough to cause him endless grief.</p>
<h3>Drastic Increase in Land Tax Conversion Rate by More Than Tenfold; Director of Land Bureau Pleads for Farmers, Principle Accepted by Central Government</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Tian Yongqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, went to Beijing by night train on the 16th to request the central government to reduce this year's land tax rate and returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties yesterday. It is reported that the central government has, in principle, accepted the request. The collection of this year's land tax still awaits the official document from the Ministry of Food. According to the central government's regulations, the standard for this year's land tax collection is 3.45 dou per mu (including 1.5 dou for price conversion, 1.5 dou for actual grain, and 0.45 dou for public grain). This is a considerable increase compared to last year's 1.96 dou per mu. Furthermore, as this city is not a production area, it is impossible to collect actual grain. According to central government regulations, the average grain price of the three months before the tax collection should be used as the standard for converting to national currency. If calculated according to this standard, this year's land tax conversion price in this city will increase by about 13 to 15 times compared to last year. Farmers will definitely be unable to bear this burden. Therefore, Director Tian personally went to Beijing to plead for the farmers of this city. After contacting Zhang Daomin, Director of the Land Tax Department of the Ministry of Food, agreement was reached in principle, but it still needs to be submitted to the Ministry of Food for a final decision.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Zhang Zhizhong with a Fake Letter of Introduction; Seeking a Job from the Mayor, Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhang Zuwu, a second lieutenant patrol officer of the 18th Traffic Police Brigade, from Shangrao, Jiangxi, felt that life was difficult and took the bizarre approach of forging the private seal of Zhang Zhizhong, the current Director of the Northwest Headquarters, and using a fake letter of introduction to seek a job from Mayor Wu. The Personnel Department of the Municipal Government discovered the forgery and, on the 18th, ordered the Municipal Guard to lure and arrest him. The Guard Captain Zhao Shijia led officers to arrest Zhang Zuwu and directly took him to the Personnel Department for interrogation. He confessed without reservation. It is now being signed and submitted to the Mayor for approval.</p>

<h3>Abandoned Monstrous Fetus; Eye Growing on Forehead</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday afternoon, residents near the Central Clinic at 1420 Kangding Road, Caojiadu, West District, reported that a monstrous fetus had been abandoned on the side of Kangding Road, its limbs twitching and emitting faint cries. The clinic sent a doctor to retrieve the fetus. Upon detailed examination, it was discovered that the infant had an eye growing on its forehead, was in a semi-sleep state, and had two fleshy horns protruding from the top of its head. The physique resembled that of a boy, with a vaguely visible genital area. It was still breathing last night and was fed liquid food, but due to concerns about the digestive system and the intestinal tract not being open, its life is unlikely to be prolonged.</p>
<h3>Encouraging Voluntary Enlistment</h3>
<p>Mr. Fang reported that after the volunteer soldiers enlisted, each person would be given daily necessities according to the method of comforting soldiers passing through, and a consolation payment of 2,000 yuan would be issued daily. He also requested the entertainment industry and the Central Film Studio to go to the barracks to show educational films to comfort them. Mr. Fang finally expressed three hopes to the press: (1) to assist in reporting dereliction of duty by grassroots administrative personnel, (2) to provide more written encouragement to volunteer soldiers who have not yet enlisted, and (3) to encourage party members, civil servants, and young students to enlist voluntarily. Director Zhang, Secretary Tan Yimin, and Committee Member Xie Dahuang of the association then made supplementary reports and answered reporters' questions. They then took a car to the new recruit conscription office to observe the volunteer soldiers' registration situation. Mr. Fang offered them much comfort and encouragement.</p>

<h3>Clues to Gold Bars, Involving Unnamed Young Girl; Bar Girl Saw Photos at Malai's Place</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The District Court continued the trial of the case of British citizen Ke Li Aque, accused of shooting Yu Shengxiao, at 9:00 AM yesterday. After Judge Zhu Yuying and Prosecutor Ding Tongjun took their seats, the first witness called was Paichuluofu, the owner of the car rental company. He testified that he had a car for rent and had known Ke Li for two years. Ke Li often rented cars, and usually had a driver with him, for a period of one to three hours. August 1st was the longest time he used the car. Ke Li came to rent the car that afternoon, saying that he was going out with his girlfriend and did not need a driver. At that time, they agreed on 80,000 yuan per time. When returning the car, he gave me a check for 800,000 yuan, along with the key, and told me to cash the excess amount and return it to him the next day. At this time, I saw that there was another person behind Ke Li, who was shorter in stature, not wearing a hat, wearing a white shirt, with a suit jacket draped over his shoulders, made of gabardine, which seemed to be summer clothing. The two of them walked into the Huizhong Hotel. Later, Ke Li ordered me to drive this person to the Broadway Mansion, and then take Ke Li home. The two of them spoke softly in the car, and the content was unclear. After the car stopped at the Broadway Mansion, I opened the door for him. I paid a little attention and it seemed that this person was flustered. When getting out of the car, I only heard "See you tomorrow." Then I drove Ke Li home.</p>
<p>Car Owner's Testimony Differs from Ke Li's</p>
<p>At this point, the court, noting the contradiction between his testimony and Ke Li's testimony the previous day, turned to Ke Li and questioned him: "Did you go alone when you returned the car?" Ke Li first said: "I went alone." Then he said: "Malai drove." He also testified: "The car fare was paid in advance with a check for 800,000 yuan. I did not want a driver at that time, and I did not say that I was going out with my girlfriend." Then Ke Li's wife, Natalia, was summoned and testified, "We have been married for three years. Because I have been deeply traumatized, I am mentally unstable and do not want to answer questions. I submitted a written report to the court previously, please use that as a basis." The court ordered the translator to translate her previous testimony into Russian and showed her the transcript from the US military court, which she nodded in agreement to. Afterwards, Fulinjing Yena Luoweifu, the owner of the New Luminous Pearl Wine Shop, testified that he was an American, 50 years old. Malai often came to the wine shop. On the morning of August 1st, at about 10:00 AM, Malai and Ke Li came together, and Malai introduced Ke Li to me. Malai came again at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, while Ke Li waited outside.</p>
<p>Planning to Exchange Gold Bars for US Dollars</p>
<p>Next, Hu  Wen, the wife of Yunlunhang staff member Zengnian, testified that at around 6:00 PM on the first day of the month, Ke Li and another person came to our house to find Xie, saying that they had a gold bar and wanted to exchange it for US dollars. At that time, I replied that I did not do this kind of business and introduced them to Chengdu Car Company to inquire. Then Hu Genhui, the owner of my sewing shop, was questioned and testified that Yu Shengxiao was in the store that day to avoid the rain, and mentioned the gold bar transaction, saying that if this business was successful, he could earn 2 million yuan. The questioning ended at 11:15 AM. The court adjourned. The questioning continued from 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Wang Zirong, the accountant of Chengdu Car Company, testified that Ke Li had come to visit with Xie's business card. Wu Zhongying, the manager of Chengdu Car Company, said that he was out at the time and did not know the situation. Le Shi, the wife of the victim Yu Shengxiao, said: On August 1st, Yu told me that an American official with great power wanted to buy gold bars. After going out at 9:30 AM, he was never seen again.</p>
<p>Malai Preparing to Marry, Needs One Thousand US Dollars</p>
<p>Finally, Gao Meiying, the cigarette girl at the Boxuelong Bar, testified that at about 10:00 AM on August 1st, Malai came to the Boxuelong Wine Shop to drink. Later, he led me to the Broadway Mansion and showed me two photos of young girls, saying that he was preparing to get married but needed 1,000 US dollars and did not have the money. I told him to drink less wine and save some money. Malai shrugged his shoulders at this and said nothing. The next morning, at 9:00 AM, he drove me home. At 8:00 PM in the evening, he came to the Xuebolong to drink again and gave me 20 US dollars. Not long after, Malai went out. At about 10:00 PM, he came again, and the two young girls in the photo also came. When Ke Li was questioned, he said he did not know Gao Meiying, but Malai had told me that a friend could exchange US dollars for him, probably referring to the cigarette girl at the Xuebolong Wine Shop. At this point, the defense lawyer Tang Huai requested the court to try to summon the two young girls in the photo to the court for questioning next time, which might lead to the discovery of the whereabouts of the gold bars. The questioning ended at about 4:00 PM in the afternoon. The court decided that the case would be heard again in ten days. The court also requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ask the US military to arrange for the American suspect Malai to appear in court at the next hearing to testify.</p>

<h3>Challenging the Great Tide! Emergency Repair of Collapsing Embankment in Nansha</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report from Hangzhou, 17th] The Qiantang River has the world-famous tidal bore, and people from all over the world go to Haining every year to see the "Qiantang River Tide," which is truly a sea of people. Now that the "Ghost Tide" of the seventh month has passed, the "Osmanthus Tide" of the eighth month is about to come like an avalanche; travel agencies and tourists are already preparing to see this annual spectacle. However, the weather is not cooperating, the tide has changed direction, the tidal bore at Haining has caused sand and soil to accumulate, and the water flow of the Qiantang River is concentrated on the south bank. The first to bear the brunt is Nansha in Xiaoshan County. However, the residents of Nansha are in no mood to watch this roaring tidal bore because the tide is more ferocious than the Japanese during the occupation. It will devour their lives, property, and land in an instant. The tidal water of the Qiantang River moves underground. With enormous force, it rushes into the strata from the riverbank, hollows out the soil, and with a booming sound, dozens of acres of farmland suddenly collapse and are scattered in the surging tidal bore, leaving no time to escape. Therefore, it has become very common for farmers in Nansha to dismantle their houses and move, just like refugees fleeing during wartime, but their feelings are even more miserable than those of wartime refugees. Their situation is exactly the opposite of that of their ancestors who immigrated to Nansha more than a hundred years ago. Their ancestors went to the New World with joy and hope, like the Europeans who went to America in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; but they are being driven back by the sea with dejection and despair, so many men who have never shed tears before are now weeping bitterly by the river.</p>
<p>River Water Erodes Toupeng Town</p>
<p>The change in the flow of the Qiantang River began in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, but at that time, the sand accumulation on the north bank and the embankment collapse on the south bank were gradual and not very obvious. In Nansha, at first, it swept away the sandy beaches that no one cared about and collapsed the uncultivable land, gradually eroding the farmland. At that time, the overall situation was unstable, and no one paid attention. By the time of victory, it had already swallowed up farmland that extended seven or eight li inland. It was not until after the spring tide this year that the embankment collapse became more severe, and the river water had eroded the first large town near the river, Toupeng, putting the residents in imminent danger. The local area was in a state of panic and commotion. Petitions and appeals for relief resounded through the town, but the Dyke Construction Bureau said that its responsibility was to protect the dike and was fully repairing the dikes that had collapsed in Haining on the north bank last year. Nansha was 20 to 30 li outside the dike on the south bank, so it could not be taken care of. The local authorities were asked to repair it themselves. The Dyke Construction Bureau could only send technical personnel to assist. After repeated requests, 400 tons of flour were allocated. However, the local area promised to raise 500 to 600 million yuan in construction funds, but they never managed to raise the money, so the emergency repair work was equivalent to doing nothing. Toupeng Town also suffered, and a large number of houses were swallowed by the sea. As a result, the Nansha problem became more serious. In mid-July, Chairman Shen rushed to inspect the disaster area and decided that the engineering office would be reorganized and taken over by the Dyke Construction Bureau. In name, it was still jointly run with the local government, but the Dyke Construction Bureau would advance the funds for emergency repairs first. On August 1st, the new engineering office was established, and the Dyke Construction Bureau specially sent Commissioner Dong to supervise the emergency repairs. Under the difficult conditions of tight funding, lack of transportation, and shortage of materials, Commissioner Dong made every effort to repair the embankment. Initially, it was planned to build three T-shaped embankments at the head and tail of the riverbank of Toupeng Town and the riverbank east of Toupeng, according to the most effective method of building embankments. However, the experiment failed because the tide was too ferocious and the riverbank was still collapsing, and the embankments became small islands separated from the land. Therefore, the most basic method had to be used, directly using stones to protect the embankment. However, due to the lack of funds and stone, the project could only build 40 meters in the most dangerous area. Therefore, embankment collapse would still occur in areas without engineering, but the embankment collapse in Toupeng had improved day by day, and the residents celebrated and no longer dismantled their houses and moved.</p>
<p>Raging Waves Hitting the Shore, Giant Stones Flying</p>
<p>On the third day of the lunar seventh month, the tide was unprecedentedly turbulent. The raging waves hit the shore, and the white waves soared into the sky, reaching a height of four or five zhang! The giant stones that were submerged in the water to protect the embankment, which required five or six people to move, were washed ashore by the tide and reached a distance of more than a hundred feet! Some of the giant stones were carried to the center of the river, and some were carried upstream. Only about 10% to 20% remained. When the residents saw that the giant stones could fly, they knew that the situation was beyond saving, so they rushed to dismantle their houses and move again. However, the engineering office still had to fight the water with all its might. They had spent more than 100 million yuan to buy wood, preparing to make wooden  and sink stones into the water to lay the foundation, and then make bamboo cages to hold stones to protect the embankment. The cages and  are connected with lead wire to prevent them from being washed ashore or carried away. The only remaining problem is how to deal with the "underground activity" of the tide. Commissioner Dong said, "The tide that is concentrated on Nansha now is the same as the tide that rushed to Haining one hundred and fifty or sixty years ago. At that time, Emperor Qianlong used a large amount of the national treasury and built a solid fish-scale dike and stone dike, plus a water diversion channel, to protect Haining. Now Nansha has no defenses, and the entire funding is only enough to build one zhang of stone dike, so it is like a large knife team resisting a modern mechanized force, how can it be resisted? Toupeng has collapsed by a quarter, becoming a peninsula, and the turbulent tide still has one month left, its fate is determined here! Our project can only be said to have done our best."

<h3>Shen Kai Case Re-Investigated Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report from Suzhou, 19th] The Wu District Procuratorate re-interrogated Shen Kai, the former Chief of General Affairs of the Suzhou Rent Collection Office, yesterday on suspicion of corruption and embezzlement. Summons were also issued to the directors of various branch offices. As a result of the serious charges, Shen Kai was returned to custody. The directors of various branch offices were each granted bail upon the submission of written guarantees worth three thousand yuan from three shops.</p>
<h3>Ministry of National Defense Collects Traitor Data</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report from Suzhou, 19th] In order to  report on the organizations of traitors and the overview of punishment, the Historical and Political Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense  collected information from the Ministry of Justice. After the Ministry issued orders to various provinces, the Jiangsu Provincial High Court has sent the files of major traitors such as Chen Gongbo, Chu Minyi, and Chen Biguin to Beijing.</p>
<h3>The Qiantang River Flow Tends Towards the Central Channel; Saving the Overall Situation Instead of Just Nansha</h3>
<p>The Nansha project is currently the most dangerous and difficult. The dike construction bureau is not doing its best to save Nansha even though the north bank has sand accumulation and the dike can be ensured to be safe. Many people are criticizing it this way, but the Dyke Construction Bureau is thinking from the overall situation and has a completely different view. Deputy Director Wang Huzhen said, "The change in the direction of water flow is a good phenomenon for the Qiantang River itself. The river flow tends to the central channel, scouring the riverbed, deepening the waterway, which is extremely beneficial to the navigation of the Qiantang River and is in line with the ideal river management plan of the Dyke Construction Bureau. The outflow of water divided into two routes, north and south, due to the influence of the sand accumulation from Jianshan to Mamuxiang during the war, can also be combined into one. The area along the river from Jianshan to the Zhutoujiao of Wengjiabu is covered with sand accumulation, covering an area of 200,000 mu, which is connected to the riverbank, so the dike is safe. Although Nansha is collapsing, it will probably stop slightly at the line of Shushan and Xinwandai. It is of less importance than ensuring the safety of Hang, Jia, Hu, Song, Su, Chang, and Tai. Before the Ming and Qing dynasties, there were three outlets in Qiantang River, one for the current road, one for the small and middle doors between Shushan and Zhesan, and one for the Nanshan Gate between Zhesan and  Mountain. At the current trend, gradually returning to the ancient road, the hidden danger of the seven counties experiencing major floods since the Ming and Qing dynasties can be eliminated."</p>
<p>From the perspective of natural trends and economic conditions, it is beyond our power to protect Nansha, and it is also unnecessary. Instead of spending manpower and resources on rescue efforts that are of no help to the overall situation, it is better to use the construction funds to provide relief to the victims. Toupeng Town is located along the river for more than 1,000 meters, but the project is only more than 4,000 meters. The tidal bore on the third day of the lunar seventh month was not very effective, let alone the turbulent "Osmanthus Tide" that is coming. Nansha is collapsing, Toupeng has become a peninsula, and the engineering office is still trying to fight the water with all its might, but what awaits them may be a dark fate. (Xing Tian)</p>

<h3>Anhui Western Refugees Gather in Bengbu; Curfew Advanced One Hour</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report from Bengbu, 17th] About 2,000 refugees from western and central Anhui who were detained escaped hastily, with few belongings. All hotels here are full, and it is very difficult to find a place to stay, so they mostly live in public places or sleep in the countryside, which is very sad. The Bengbu fellow villagers associations of various counties have organized a refugee relief association to appeal to all parties for relief. For the sake of stepping up prevention, the city defense department advanced the curfew by one hour from the 15th, starting at 11:00 PM every night, martial law began, and lifted at 5:30 AM the next morning.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Autumn Cocoon Harvest Only Reaches 70%</h3>

<h3>Overseas Fujianese in Hong Kong, Chen Juesheng, Wishes to Return to China to Serve the Nation in Suppressing Rebellion</h3>

<h3>Shanghai County Magistrate Yu Talks About the Water Monster</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's Minhang sixteenth dispatch] Recently, rumors of a water monster in the Huangpu River have been rife, causing widespread anxiety. Shanghai County Magistrate Yu specifically made a statement to reporters, saying: "The so-called water monster is actually a purposeful rumor. Residents should remain calm. If you don't find it strange, the strange thing will disappear by itself."</p>
<h3>Between Shanghai and Taiwan</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's nineteenth dispatch] Thirty hours by sea or three and a half hours by air, has made the distance between Taiwan and inland Shanghai shorter and shorter. Normal transportation on the Shanghai-Taiwan line helps the overall integration and intersection of inland and island culture and life. But even though the distance is shortening, time doesn't seem to help get rid of multiple barriers.</p>
<p>Taiwan Dollar Incites Division</p>
<p>The only special thing about Taiwan is the Taiwan dollar. The Taiwan dollar is actually used to stabilize prices in the province and build a breakwater for the island. But at the moment, this breakwater has been cracked by the surging waves inside and outside. Industrial products on the island cannot be exported steadily, while supplementary raw materials and machinery are still urgently needed. In the past, it relied on the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's 20 billion legal currency to make the foreign exchange conversion, but whether Taiwan Sugar is willing to convert it at the official price of 72 yuan to the Taiwan dollar has become a problem. Therefore, the provincial government has repeatedly sought a normal way for exchange but failed. The black market price of Taiwan dollars in the Taipei market has fallen to as low as 52.</p>
<p>Prices Exceed Shanghai</p>
<p>This situation has hurt the gold diggers who went from the Nanjing-Shanghai line, but on the contrary, it has encouraged the peddlers. They can remit one million legal currency with a ship ticket, which is more than enough to pay for the travel expenses. This kind of money-making travel has made Shanghainese see Taiwanese local products, and has also made Taiwanese compatriots see the index of rising prices.</p>
<p>Saying that prices in Taiwan are low, either is wrong or it is something in the past. People who go from Shanghai to Taiwan or from Taiwan to Shanghai will feel that prices on the island are high. When converted with the Taiwan dollar, it exceeds Shanghai. It is not easy to earn a lot of money in Taiwan, and commercially speaking, there is no big appetite, but it is not difficult to consume. The provincial government's institutions for controlling and regulating supplies are still busy receiving because of personnel transactions; many people are saving infinite heat.</p>
<p>Maintaining Traditional Life</p>
<p>Those who have been in Taiwan for a long time are unwilling to stay there any longer, but there are many people in Shanghai who are attacking Taiwan. The island has its advantages, but it also has its shortcomings. The government that "digs for gold" is not welcome, and the people are not happy either. Taiwanese people need to maintain and continue a simple, honest, earnest, and hardworking life tradition, but unfortunately it is being destroyed and diluted day by day.</p>
<p>Outside of the New Soldier Base</p>
<p>Militarily, Taiwan can be used as a base for training new soldiers, and it seems more suitable as an island park. The existing construction adds modern beauty to the monotonous scenery, and the favorable weather and geographical location give the island another view. Here, a two-week tour can obtain great fun.</p>
<p>There are several types of people who can be praised, such as technical workers who work hard in the field, academic researchers, and honest and dedicated administrative staff... They seek comfort in work and career in narrow, monotonous, and lonely situations. This is the vitality that stability gives them. (Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun)</p>

<h3>Student Economic Canteen Resolved by the Municipal Government Meeting Yesterday to Reorganize</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] For the convenience and economy of students in various universities in the city, student economic canteens were established. Later, due to the end of the Shanghai branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, there was no supply of flour, and they had to be closed, which had a significant impact on the daily meals of students. In view of this, the municipal government resolved at a municipal meeting yesterday to reorganize the canteens. Detailed measures will be drafted jointly by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Education Bureau.</p>
<h3>The Education Bureau Orders That Newly Hired Teachers and Staff of Municipal Elementary Schools Be Submitted for Review by a Deadline</h3>
<p>[This newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau recently instructed all national schools in the city that the periods for submitting newly hired teachers and staff of the municipal national schools for review varied, and the various forms to be submitted were also not uniform. Special notes on submitting teachers and staff for review have been formulated, stipulating that the submission matters should be completed within 20 days after the start of each semester. Because the method was promulgated later this semester, it is specially postponed for half a month, extending to before October 5. The following are the details of the notes: (1) The submission of newly hired teachers for review by each school should be completed within 20 days after the start of each semester. (2) Teachers hired by each school must be registered and qualified by the bureau before they can be submitted for review. (3) When submitting for review, the "School-wide Proposed Teacher Application Form" and the "Salary Grade Review Record Form" of the personnel to be reviewed should be filled out, and a photo of the person should be attached and stamped with the school seal. (4) The name filled in should be consistent with the name on the registration or qualification certificate. If there are any inconsistencies in other qualification documents, a valid certificate from the person's native county government or other qualification certificate should be submitted. (5) When submitting for review, the registration certificate or qualification certificate and various qualification documents should be submitted together, bound into a book in order, and a cover directory should be added. (6) The service record column of the review form should be filled in chronological order and should not be filled in reverse order. (7) If service documents (such as appointment orders, etc.) do not have start and end dates or do not indicate the stage, the payment period will be used for calculation. (8) If teachers and staff fail to submit for review on time, they will be paid at the lowest grade before they are submitted for review, and they will not be allowed to request additional payments. (9) According to Article 2 of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Provisional Measures for Employees to Apply for Salary Revision, a solid certificate and reason should be submitted within one month of the arrival of the approved document, and the application for revision should be limited to one time. Also, according to the provisions of Item 2 of the same article, if the application for revision cannot be made within the prescribed time limit, the reasons should be explained in detail and an application should be made to extend the time limit, but it should still not exceed one month.</p>
<h3>A Primary School Teacher's Confession Reveals the Dark Side of Japanese Education</h3>
<p>School Education Still Advances on the Road of Militarism</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency Tokyo twelfth airmail] The Asahi Shimbun's "Voice of the Readers" column here published a letter from Ermu Xingping, a primary school teacher in Miyagi Prefecture, entitled "Democratization of the Education Sector?" The letter stated: "The teacher qualification review has been held since last year, but it has always been just a formality. Among the 9,000 teachers in Miyagi Prefecture, only 10 have failed the review. The wartime school administration posture is still preserved. The Ministry of Education officials do not criticize or review it in any way, and school education still follows the road of militarism. People who were local inspectors in the Ministry of Education during the war, although some of them continued to work after the war, most of them transferred to various counties to serve as principals. We firmly oppose this kind of formal democratization. Furthermore, in terms of personnel administration, we have never valued those who come from exams. Even with decades of teaching experience and excellent teaching skills, it is difficult to be promoted to principal. The personnel changes in March of this year caused anger among general teachers. Now, if this kind of injustice and discrimination are not broken, there is no hope of realizing the democratization of education forever." From this paragraph in the letter, it can be explained not only that Japanese education administration has not been democratized at all, but also that the democratization situation of other general politics and economy can be inferred from this. This confession of a primary school teacher is by no means a meaningless complaint. At a time when the Allied countries are discussing the peace treaty with Japan, this fact should be paid attention to.</p>

In addition to Chairman Skinner, representatives from various football clubs attended. The most important discussion was about the decision of the first division teams. In the past, there were 14 teams participating. This year, Kitchee requested to join the first division, making it 15 teams. Therefore, some people suggested eliminating one team from Eastern, Kwong Wah, Air Force, and Kitchee. Some people also suggested relegating the Hong Kong Club, which had the worst record last season. After some debate, Kitchee was persuaded by Li Hanquan with a speech, stating that Kitchee's lineup was based on Sing Tao B, supplemented by Li Tiansheng, Fok Yiu-wah, etc. After several consultations, it was finally passed that 15 teams would participate in the first division this year, and it was decided to add games on Wednesdays at the beginning and end of the season.

<p>Conference Agenda</p>
<p>The three-day agenda includes the opening ceremony on the morning of the 20th, followed by group reviews of proposals in the afternoon. On the morning of the 21st, each district will present a report, followed by a conference in the afternoon to discuss the proposals reviewed by each group. On the 22nd, the conference will continue to discuss proposals and temporary motions, elect directors and supervisors, and read the conference declaration. After reporting the election results, the conference will hold a closing ceremony.</p>
<p>Important Issues</p>
<p>The important issues for this conference are to discuss the overall plan for the production, construction, and development of the textile industry. Among the important proposals, Shi Fengxiang proposed a ten-year plan for the development of the national textile industry. The proposals from the District 6 Association include: (1) A proposal that member factories that directly spin finished products from their own spun cotton yarn should not be subject to business tax in accordance with the law. (2) A proposal that the stamp tax on warehouse receipts should be applied at the rate for deposit documents, with each item (i.e., each sheet) stamped with 500 yuan. (3) A proposal that the standard for fixed asset appreciation be stipulated and depreciation methods be established to achieve uniformity, as the fixed asset appreciation of member factories varies widely. (4) A proposal that the electricity supply in the Shanghai city area is often cut off, causing heavy losses to cotton mills. Measures should be taken to expand power generation equipment and restrict unnecessary consumption to benefit production. (5) A proposal to request all yarn factories across the country to restore the twelve-hour workday to increase production and reduce costs. (6) A proposal to determine how to handle foreign-owned yarn factories and Chinese-operated yarn factories within the jurisdiction of each district that have delayed joining the association. In addition, Districts 1, 6, 7, and 8 proposed three items for seeking remedies regarding the issue of opening trade with Japan, urging the government to pay close attention to the matter.</p>
<p>When the association reviews the proposals, it will be divided into five groups: association affairs, raw materials, production, sales and transportation, and economic administration, for separate review. The association held its first general meeting in Chongqing in 1945.</p>
<h3>Authorities Consider Selling Xian Rice - Proposed to Relax Rice Allocation Targets - Proposed to Increase Allocation to the Poor</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian stated yesterday: The 70,000 dan of food rice recently allocated to the Municipal Food Distribution Committee by the Ministry of Food is Xian rice, and the authorities are still considering the policy of selling Xian rice. However, it is proposed to relax the scope of rice allocation targets. In addition to expanding sales to industrial workers and students, the surplus rice will be used as much as possible for rice allocation to the poor. The amount of rice allocated to the poor in the next phase will be increased.</p>
<p>Joint Venture Company Still Under Negotiation</p>
<p>In addition, the Municipal Food Distribution Committee plans to establish a storage and transportation office while taking advantage of the new grain harvest season, entrusting the Rice Business Association to organize a joint venture company, with the government providing loans to purchase rice from the production areas and store it in Shanghai. The Rice Business Association has expressed its refusal to accept this. According to Wu Kaiguang yesterday: The joint venture company will be discussed again after Ren Xianqun of the China Trust Bureau returns to Shanghai from Hankou.</p>
<p>Market Stabilizes and Declines Yesterday</p>
<p>[This Newspaper] The rice market stabilized and declined yesterday. After the opening, because various gangs continued to arrive with goods, the market was filled with samples, the weather was sunny and there were not many new products, people's minds were relaxed, and in the situation where supply exceeded demand, the demand was sluggish and the market was weak. The stalls all fell, with Japonica and Bo Rice both falling by about 20,000 yuan. In the South City, Japonica sold for 570,000 yuan, Bo Rice for 600,000 yuan, and Early Rice for 595,000 yuan. In the North City, Japonica sold for 610,000 yuan, and Bo Rice for 640,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The goods arrived yesterday from various gangs, with 8,601 shi in the North City and 3,979 shi in the South City. Also, 886 shi and 2 dou of Hankou Sharp Rice, 143 shi and 5 dou of Sichuan Sharp Rice, and 64 shi of Du Sharp Rice.</p>
<p>Five Illegal Rice Merchants Penalized</p>
<p>The police bureau's economic police monitored the North and South rice markets yesterday and arrested a total of five "rice weevils". Ye Bonan and Zhuang Jingrong were arrested in the South Rice Market for borrowing other people's entry permits and were each sentenced to three days of detention. Liu Bingzhang was arrested in the North Rice Market for loitering suspiciously in front of the market gate and was fined one day of detention. Pan Guifen did not bring an entry permit, and Chen Qishan used another person's entry permit, and each was sentenced to three days of detention.</p>
<h3>Measures for the Purchase and Production of Edible Oil by Proxy Have Been Drafted</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Bureau, in view of the fact that the restoration of free trading in the edible oil market has not achieved the expected stability in prices, plans to entrust oil mills to purchase and produce oil by proxy, increasing production by 30,000 dan per month, and is actively promoting this plan to achieve it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It is learned that the various oil mills are interested in this method. The Third Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association has drafted the method, which is similar to the previous method by which the Central Trust Bureau entrusted manufacturers to purchase rapeseed by proxy. However, of the 30,000 dan of finished products, soybean oil will account for half, and the rest will depend on the quantity of rapeseed and sesame raw materials. The main targets for the purchase locations for rapeseed will still be Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Wuhu, while soybeans will be expanded to Kaifeng, Hankou, Xuzhou, and Bengbu.</p>
<p>According to the ratio of raw materials to production, soybeans can produce an average of 9 jin of oil per dan. If 15,000 dan of oil are produced, approximately 170,000 dan of raw materials will be required. Each dan of rapeseed produces 30 jin of oil, and sesame produces 40 jin. If the two are mixed to produce the above quantity of oil, approximately 50,000 dan of raw materials will be required. According to the market price on the 19th, soybeans cost 240,000 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>China Tanker Company Invites All Sectors to Visit</h3>
<p>China Tanker Co., Ltd. is the first oil transportation institution in China. It has four Class A tankers with a deadweight of over 10,000 tons and eighteen Class B tankers with a deadweight of 1,200 tons. Since its organization and establishment in February of this year and the start of navigation, it has been more than half a year, and its business development has been extremely rapid. It is heard that the company, with its Class A tanker Yonghong about to set sail for the ocean, has specially scheduled tomorrow (the 21st) from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the Yonghong tanker at the China Merchants Bureau's Outer Hongqiao Second Wharf to invite people from all walks of life to come and visit. Chairman Weng Wenhao will personally host the event and will provide visitors with an oil tanker brochure, which describes the company's overview, the structure and equipment of the oil tanker, and the history of the development of oil tankers in the world in great detail.</p>
<h3>Negotiated Cotton Yarn Prices Remain Unchanged - Market Price of Cotton Cloth Continues to Rise Yesterday</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] The negotiated price of cotton yarn at the Textile Association did not change yesterday, with 20-count yarn still maintaining the original price of 11.8 million yuan. The prices of other counts of yarn are determined by the Textile Construction Company in proportion and with reference to market conditions.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions saw the market turn from stable to firm. In the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose to as high as 19.3 million yuan, a further increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened slightly firm, but the market sentiment softened due to the arrival of inspectors on the scene for spot checks. Throughout the day, Jingyuan fine cloth and dark-colored White Cat floral cloth sold well, and the market was firm. Longtou fine cloth ended up rising by 12,000 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>China Textile's Allocation Price for Yarn is Too High</p>
<p>According to investigations by the Economic Section of the Police Bureau, the recent price fluctuations in the yarn market are mainly due to the fact that the allocation price of yarn by the China Textile Company has increased along with the black market price, and there have been cases where the black market price has fallen but the allocation price has not, resulting in prices exceeding the black market price. This has made it difficult to carry out price equalization work. It is hoped that the company will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>The China Textile Construction Company followed its usual practice of selling yarn in two groups, A and B, yesterday. Group A sold 694 pieces of yarn, with 268 applications. Group B sold 1,215 pieces of yarn, with 965 applications.</p>
<p>Seven People Detained for Entering Without a Permit</p>
<p>The Yarn and Cloth Group of the Economic Investigation Brigade of the Police Bureau continued to send personnel to monitor the cotton cloth market yesterday. They arrested Xu Yaozhang, Bao Zipei, Zhang Chengzhao, Wang Xishan, Chi Zhishan, Ren Songmao, Chen Xueyi and other seven people for entering the market without a permit and detained them for three days as a warning. They also found 79 expired entry permits, and the police bureau has ordered the person in charge of the cotton cloth industry association to complete the entry permit procedures before the 26th and has given them a warning.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Cotton transactions were quiet yesterday. Cotton mills are watching cautiously due to tight money and weak yarn prices. Some traders have tight money, some have loose money, and not many transactions were made. Most of the deals that were made were on credit. Due to interest rate relations, prices were clearly stable but secretly declining. Stalls sold a total of 740 bales.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Mediocre, Foreign Stocks In Consolidation</h3>
<p>Public bonds fell slightly yesterday, but the situation was still mediocre. Unified C opened at 12,400 yuan. Lots 360, 555 were sold, and the market fell to 11,600 yuan. Lots 503, 550 were slightly accepted and rose slightly to close at 12,000 yuan. As a result, Unified A and B fell by 200 yuan compared to the previous close, Unified C fell by 500 yuan, Unified D fell slightly by 100 yuan, and Unified E fell by 400 yuan. The transaction volume was still only 5 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks fluctuated uncertainly yesterday, with the process being weak at the beginning and gradually stabilizing later. Ewo Silk opened at 92,800 yuan and immediately rose. In the afternoon, it rose slightly to 94,700 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. Although the Guangdong gang and foreign firms were accepting, securities firms and retail investors were selling, and the transaction volume was still small. It was even rarer in the afternoon. As a result, British Union, Wheelock Marden, Guangdong Shipping, Steel Industry, and Telephone fell slightly compared to the previous close, Ewo fell by half a percent, and Ewo Silk Paper was still flat.</p>
<h3>Rayon Soars</h3>
<p>The rayon market soared yesterday. 120 Golden Three Horse, Gaoshan, and others opened at 25.3 million yuan, and there was a strong demand from all parties. By noon, it had risen to 27 million yuan. The upward trend intensified in the afternoon, with new highs emerging one after another, but the buying enthusiasm did not diminish, and finally created a new record price of 29 million yuan. Dongyang was 29.5 million yuan, an increase of 3.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. This was due to the exhaustion of inventory and frequent sales. Although the Central Trust Bureau sells allocations on schedule, it still cannot meet the amount of consumption, which has caused the market to rise day by day.</p>
<p>Raw Silk</p>
<p>The market also rose sharply yesterday. Bids for all grades were 1.5 million yuan to 2 million yuan higher than the previous day. D-grade and E-grade grades were especially sought after. With current inventory drying up day by day, the market is even more popular. Yesterday, BC grades were bid at 40 million yuan, D-grade at 29.5 million yuan, and medium grades were bid at several levels from 26.5 million yuan to 28 million yuan. Gan Jing opened with a general bid of 26 million yuan, and 28 points and 5 dans were around 28 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Developing Nanyang Trade - There Should Be a Sense of Urgency and Priority</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] According to the analysis of economic expert Gao Shiheng, Nanyang is an agricultural society, and industrial products all rely on imports from foreign countries. The main categories are cotton yarn, cloth, cotton textiles, machinery, hardware and electrical appliances, and food. In 1938, the total imports of various states reached more than 330 million US dollars. Before the war, China's trade with Nanyang was mostly with Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. China imported more rice from Vietnam, and a large amount of oil was imported from Borneo and Jambi, so the trade volume with the Dutch East Indies increased significantly. The goods that China exports to Nanyang can be divided into two major categories: light industrial products and native products. The former is dominated by yarn and cloth and cotton textiles. China also has a place in hardware and daily necessities, such as light bulbs, electric fans, glassware and stationery. Chemicals and miscellaneous grains also have sales. In terms of export and trade figures, 1940 was a great improvement compared to 1938, but it was unfortunately interrupted by the outbreak of the Pacific War. In the future, China's trade with Nanyang should be arranged with a sense of urgency and priority. From a global perspective, China should strive to win the Dutch East Indies market with all its strength, because the area has the largest population and the strongest capacity. If we can capture the market in this area, half of the problem will be solved. The second is Malaya. The rubber and tin produced there can still maintain the world market, and Singapore is its hub. After Siam clears its debts, it will restore economic freedom, and trade is also promising. The prospects for Vietnam and Myanmar to trade with me are still difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Public Sentiment Remains Indifferent - China Stocks Still Have Not Improved</h3>
<p>The off-market terror of China stocks continued to exist yesterday, and more and more people were delivering goods, and another wave of declines reappeared in the middle of the session. However, after the sharp decline, the shorts accepted, and the situation gradually stabilized. Hot stocks rose and fell slightly, while miscellaneous stocks were slightly inferior, and Cement New Asia closed down.</p>
<p>Morning</p>
<p>The public sentiment was still stabilizing. When the market opened, the increases and decreases were slight. After Yongsha opened, Hengshu and Qianduiye continued to sell. Starting from 222 yuan for immediate delivery and 230 yuan for deferred delivery, they gradually gained lower. However, deferred Yongsha struggled within 220 yuan, and eventually, because the lingering fear had not dissipated, many people delivered the goods. The off-market interest rate was still standing at a high price of 2 jiao, 2 fen, 5 li and 2 jiao, 7. Immediate delivery was constantly selling short.</p>
<p>After 10:30, it was forced down to a low price of 210 yuan for immediate delivery and 217 yuan for deferred delivery, and then some people began to cover. Cement was sold urgently from 225 to the limit of the stop board, and then it was slightly recovered by No. 137 Weite. New Asia was sold from No. 191 to the stop board, but Yongsha's position stabilized, and the situation hovered, with few transactions. Extending to 11:15, yarn and flower gangs accepted slightly more, and the afternoon closing rose to 216 yuan and 224 yuan. Although the hot stocks fell, they did not fall much. Deferred Jingfu even rose slightly. Only deferred Xinhe fell the most by half a percent. The miscellaneous stocks fell more. New Asia fell to the limit, and Cement rebounded slightly after falling to the limit.</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>The off-market first called higher. Deferred Yongsha showed slightly when it appeared on the market, but after hearing the night report that there would be continued aid to China, it became weak again. Present Yongsha was as low as 218 yuan, and deferred Yongsha stopped at 223 yuan. Later, although the National Bank exchanged the difference, the upward trend could not last, and eventually ended in a consolidation. As a result, in comparison with the previous close, the immediate delivery stocks Yongsha, Xinguang, Zhongfa, Xinhua, Jing, Commerce, Zhongfang, Rongfeng, and Zhabei fell slightly, Xinhe, Huafeng, and Jingfu rose slightly, Meiya, Zhongsi, Huochai, and Lian were still flat, and Ni Nei fell by half a percent, while Cement New Asia rebounded after falling to the limit, closing down by half a percent. In terms of deferred delivery stocks, Yongsha, Xinhe, and Xinguang fell slightly, Huafeng was flat, and Meiya and Jingfu fell slightly. The off-market old stocks were relatively stable, except for Dasheng, which fell a little more.</p>
<h3>Flour Evaluation Meeting Scheduled for Next Monday</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] In order to rationalize the price of flour, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has decided to restore the flour price negotiation system with reference to the actual cost of manufacturers. The first flour evaluation meeting has been scheduled for 10:00 AM next Monday at the Social Affairs Bureau. The attending agencies will include the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Fourth District Flour Industry Association, the Municipal Flour Business Association, the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, the China Trust Bureau, and the Materials Allocation Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Also: The allocated price of flour is the same, but most of it is miscellaneous brand flour, which is actively being sold, and the market is firm. Miscellaneous brands have risen slightly, and the same is true for unified flour. Bran sales have turned sluggish and have fallen back by 1,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of the World Literary Scene Over the Past 75 Years</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>The editor asked me to write on this topic, limiting the word count to within 2,000 characters. This is truly a difficult task, but since I am a special contributor to this publication’s "Current World Literary Scene," I found it hard to refuse. I can only offer a rough overview.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao was founded in 1872. Coincidentally, this is close to the beginning of the Neo-Romanticism era. Most researchers of literary trends say that the period of Naturalism was from 1830 to 1870. Would it be inappropriate to consider 1871 as the beginning or gestation of Neo-Romanticism? Probably not.</p>
<p>Neo-Romanticism</p>
<p>The difference between Neo-Romanticism and Romanticism, in simple terms, is that the former is Romanticism that has passed through Naturalism, that is, Romanticism that has been baptized by science, while the latter is merely idealistic Romanticism. In other words, Romanticism seems to envision a realm of fantasy outside the world we live in, like a lark soaring in the sky, or dreaming of knights of the Middle Ages. But Neo-Romanticism wants to build a paradise on earth, and all the mystery and symbolism have passed through reality.</p>
<p>Neo-Romanticism includes the following various movements: Decadence, Symbolism, Aestheticism, Mysticism, Hedonism, all of which can be grouped together.</p>
<p>Decadence (Decndant) originated in France, around 1882. A group of young literary scholars gathered in the basement of a café in the Latin Quarter of Paris, singing and drinking, which marked the beginning of Decadent literature. Initially, this group was just a symbol, completely without meaning. Later, the famous poet Morias joined and changed the name to Decadence, meaning borrowing a term from French history of civilization for people in the declining period of Roman civilization. In addition to Morias, this school included Meends, Baudelaire, Veraine, Mallarme, Huysman, Regnier, etc., and was also known as Symbolism.</p>
<p>When this school spread to England, it became Aestheticism. Swinburne and Wilde were both great figures of this school. It is a well-known story that Wilde wore strange clothes and paraded through the streets holding a lily.</p>
<p>The masters of Mysticism include Maeterlinck and Verhaeren of Belgium. They often like to use mysterious themes, but in fact, they are just symbols of truth. Maeterlinck's fairy tale drama "The Blue Bird," which uses the blue bird to symbolize happiness, is well known.</p>
<p>Neo-Idealism</p>
<p>In Hakuson Kuriyagawa's famous book "Ten Lectures on Modern Literature" and Hisao Honma's "On Modern European Literary Trends," only Neo-Romanticism is discussed. Zhang Menglin's ("Reminiscence of Autumn Life") "Recent European Literary Trends" has a final chapter titled "Literary Trends in the Period of Transformation," but it also includes German Expressionism. Finally, it also mentions Neo-Idealism. However, Huang Lihua's "Modern Literary Trends" and Wu Yun's "Modern Literature" both directly use the general name of Neo-Idealism to include all 20th-century literature (such as Humanism, etc.), but these were all old works before 1928.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, Neo-Idealism has an ideal, that is, a kind of advocacy. The name Humanism is even more obvious. The difference between it and Naturalism lies in the fact that Naturalism only exposes the darkness of society and does not point out a bright path; it only describes the symptoms, but does not prescribe a prescription. But Neo-Idealism clearly shows us what we should do. Tolstoy and Rolland are the two giant stars of this movement. Tolstoy's "What is Art?" vigorously attacked the decadent Symbolists. Rolland's "Jean-Christophe" (translated by Fu Lei) has become a passionate favorite of Chinese youth.</p>
<p>Expressionism is mostly in the form of drama, starting from love for humanity. German writers opposed their country's warmongering. This type of drama can also be called "Shouting Drama," all of which are enthusiastic shouts, so they cannot write novels. See Liu Dajie's "The Literature of Expressionism" and "An Outline of German Literature" for details. Representative writers include Kaiser, Unruh, Toller, and Werfel. Of the above four, only Unruh is still alive; the others have passed away. Kaiser and Werfel both died in 1945, and Toller died in 1939.</p>
<p>Kiyoshi Naruse's "A Short History of Modern World Literature" and Takeo Chiba's "An Outline of Modern World Literature" want to use the First World War, which began in 1914, as a new boundary, but it seems that they cannot be simply summarized into a unified system. Naruse Kiyoshi said: "No matter which era it is, there are many literary circles that repel, combine, and intertwine with each other. Such a complicated and chaotic situation as the current literary circle has never been seen before." For example, the British D.H. Lawrence and James Joyce, who construct sexual psychology, have a feeling of being unclassifiable.</p>
<p>Neo-Realism</p>
<p>According to Yi Qun's "Basic Knowledge of Literature," the literature of the past ten years or so is called Neo-Realism, which is actually an extension of Neo-Idealism. If we focus on the Second World War, we might as well call it Democraticism. (Democraticism) This is a name I made up. I think this war was a struggle between the democratic camp and the fascist camp. Finally, the fascist German, Japanese, and Italian imperialism fell, and the democratic countries won. Most of the progressive German writers also fled abroad, opposing their country's measures. See my translation "Recent German Literature" published in "Bungei Shunju," Volume 5, Issue 3. The May issue of "Renaissance" has five long articles introducing the recent literary trends of five countries: Britain, the United States, Germany, France, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>For Soviet modern literature, see "The Road of Soviet Literature" and "The Road of Post-War Soviet Literature" (both published by Shidai Shubaoshe). For British modern literature, I bought a book by John Hayward, "Prose Literature Since 1939." Unfortunately, Stephen Spender's "Poetry Since 1939" and H. Reed's "Short Stories Since 1939" could not be bought. "Drama Since 1939" has no author yet. These four books are all included in the "Arts in Britain" series. There are also special books on architecture, dance, film, painting, and music, as well as the arts of Scotland and Wales. For the United States, I bought a book by Ludwig Lewisohn, "The Story of American Literature," which narrates up to the present. For France, I recommend Xu Zhongnian's "The Main Trends of French Literature." Except for the first chapter, all of them talk about modern French literature. Shangwu.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to introduce a very important English book, that is, Horatio Smith's "Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature." Each entry is written by experts in the literature of various countries, who are responsible for signing their names. There are a total of 899 pages, with small font and double lines. A total of 237 professors were invited to write it. Even the literature of small countries such as Albania, Catalonia, Turkey, and Ukraine has an overview. It is really a book worth reading.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations today, there are also several articles such as Xu Weinan's "Shanghai Literature in the Past 75 Years" and Yu Jianhua's "Chinese Painting in the Past 75 Years," which will be published successively. "One Inch of Mountain and River, One Inch of Blood" will be suspended for one day. We hereby declare this. (Editor)</p>
<h3>Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Dedication</h3>
<p>Someone occasionally asked about "Chunqiu," saying, "'Chunqiu,' how tall is 'Chunqiu'?" I would like to answer like this: If "Chunqiu" can be said to represent one of the supplements of this newspaper, then this newspaper has been soliciting poems, ballads, and the like from poets and writers since the day it was founded, as the initial form of the supplement, it has only passed the age of seventy-seven. Although it is a long life for a person, it has only been three-quarters of a century in a career, and its qualifications are still shallow. If calculated from the publication of "Ziyoutan," it is only thirty-six years old, which is even younger. As for "Chunqiu" on "Chunqiu," it was founded in the 21st year of the Republic of China and is only fifteen years old today, just in its prime, which is even younger.</p>
<p>I often think that if "Ziyoutan" is the eldest son of this newspaper, then "Chunqiu" is just a little sister.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is because she is a little sister, young and ignorant, with unremoved childishness, who often cannot help but sing about the wind and the moon, interact with poets and writers, and like to quibble over words. This can also be said to be the family style of a scholarly family for seventy-five years. However, she has not forgotten the "spring plowing and summer weeding, autumn harvest and winter storage" of cultivation and harvest; she is sincere, frank, and pure, and she symbolizes her pursuit of truth, goodness, and beauty with the two characters "Chunqiu," just like Confucius used "Chunqiu" to rectify names and define divisions. She believes that as long as the spirit of truth, goodness, and beauty is universally promoted, rebellious officials and traitors will disappear without a trace. Of course, this kind of thinking is somewhat out of tune with the times. But she doesn't care.</p>
<p>Some people also say that since the national newspaper supplements originated in Shen Bao, then the source of Shen Bao's supplement should be the beginning of the national newspaper supplements. So, why does a newspaper have a supplement? What is the definition of a supplement? Yes, the emergence of the supplement, like the emergence of the newspaper, has its own reasons. So, it might as well try to formulate a definition today:</p>
<p>Any literary, specialized academic, and all knowledgeable and interesting texts on newspapers, which are published on fixed pages to meet the trends of the times and the needs of readers, are called supplements.</p>
<p>The status of supplements, according to the development of the newspaper industry, can be said to be as important as the main publication (commentary and news pages). Its function and value are: (1) to cooperate with newspaper commentary and news, (2) to introduce ideas, scholarship, and knowledge and skills, (3) to regulate and increase readers' interest, (5) to provide readers with the opportunity to publish texts and exchange opinions.</p>
<p>As for the supplement editor, for the supplement, it is like a nanny; for the reader, it is like a chef, and some people say it is a gardener. In fact, whether it is a nanny, a chef, or a gardener, in the final analysis, it is just a servant. However, according to the custom of democratic countries, all government officials, from the president down, can call themselves public servants. In this way, how fortunate is the supplement editor! In fact, it is not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>Now, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the founding of this newspaper and the commemorative birthday of the 25,000th issue, the editor cannot be without a word. Therefore, I will briefly discuss the general meaning of the supplement based on what I know, in order to correct the previous editors, writing authors, and readers who love this publication, and to wish you peace and happiness!

<h3>Old Records of "Chunqiu"</h3>
<p>— Shou</p>
<p>How fast! Seventy-five springs and autumns have passed since this newspaper was published. If it is compared to a person, then he is an old gentleman of seventy-five years old with high moral character. The author entered the museum in the eighth year of the Republic of China and was fortunate enough to be an old partner of his for thirty years. In this long life history of seventy-five years, I unconsciously consumed most of my years. He has indeed overcome one difficult situation after another with deep roots, and the author has also shed tears and has seen the vicissitudes of life. However, since the outbreak of the Pacific War until after the victory, the author has not participated in actual work in the museum, just like Miaoyu in the Grand View Garden in "Dream of the Red Chamber," who is an outsider. However, no matter what, the outsider is still in the wall circle of the Grand View Garden, and of course, we share the joys and sorrows, and we feel the same pain. I thought that after braving the dangerous waves, it was easy to see the moonlight and wind again, which is already a commendable and congratulatory thing. What's more, he is getting stronger as he gets older and is revitalizing his family business. Not only does he not have any signs of old age, but he is returning to his childhood and is full of vigor and vitality. So, how can we old partners not be happy and celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday?</p>
<p>Brother Wang Jinshan, the editor of Chunqiu, urged me to narrate some of the circumstances of the founding of the journal because I was the founder of Chunqiu. This is just like the people of the Tianbao Palace telling the story of Kaiyuan. It is inevitable that I will feel a lot of emotion. I have been editing "Ziyoutan" for more than ten years, and I have always dealt with it conscientiously. In the autumn of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the late General Manager Shi Gongliang wanted to change the taste of the readers, so he specially invited Mr. Li Liewen to assist in the management, to collect articles from some new writers, and still ordered me to be responsible for reviewing and editing. I was originally a good old man, and I could do everything. I obeyed the order respectfully. However, after a few days, the submitted articles were often not reviewed by me, and they were published on their own, which made me a mere figurehead, doing nothing. Therefore, I had to know that it was difficult to retreat and express my intention to let Xian to Shi Gong. Thanks to Shi Gong's old feelings and kindness, he insisted on keeping me and said, "Since 'Ziyoutan' has changed its nature, you might as well have another supplement, and you can lead an army alone and work hard." Out of gratitude, I used the silly spirit that a scholar would die for his confidant and hurriedly recruited troops and bought horses, determined to do a good job. Finally, in January of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Chunqiu was founded, and the name Chunqiu was also decided after repeated discussions with Shi Gong.</p>
<p>I have always taken an eclectic attitude when editing supplements. I welcome the new school of manuscripts, and I do not discriminate against the old school. The main purpose is to be meaningful and interesting. I also strive for beauty in the arrangement of formats and the embellishment of books. Therefore, at the beginning of the publication, in terms of writing, I specially invited Mr. Cheng Zhanlu to write "Zhanlu Random Notes," Mr. Wang Zhongxian to write "Shanghai Gossip," and I also wrote a kind of "Violet Tea Talk," which were published in turn under the headline, in the first place. In the middle, I arranged a short story, which was Mr. Sun Honglei's "Guilt," and at the bottom, I arranged a special column, divided into twelve kinds: "New Invention," "Small Common Sense," "Travel in Art," "Small Gardening," "Small Novel," "Character Sketch," "Custom Sketch," "World Rare News," "Travel Traces," "Children's Paradise," "Women's Paradise," and "Laughter Mobilization," publishing one kind every day, and the material seemed to be very substantial. On the one hand, I also specially invited the famous painter Mr. Fang Xueli to be responsible for the design of the paintings. The headlines of the newspaper were changed from horizontal to vertical from time to time, and a small and exquisite pattern had to be matched with each article. The titles of the special columns and novels were also specially drawn according to their meanings. Therefore, from the surface, there was a kind of colorfulness. Later, when I got tired of short stories, I specially invited Mr. Zhang Henshui to write long stories, including "Four Company Commanders of Northeast," "Little West Heaven," and "Changing Nest Orioles and Phoenixes" (this work was not finished due to the outbreak of the August 13th War). Mr. Qin Shouou also translated a "Record of Imperial Fragrant Silk" by Ms. Deling, which were all well-known at the time. When the special columns were used up, I specially selected a few small and sophisticated works and compiled them into a small Chunqiu column, just like a kangaroo's pouch, with a small kangaroo in it, which was very interesting! I have to mention here that I have received a lot of help from my brother Huang Jiping in the past few years. To this day, we still maintain a warm friendship, which has not changed for a long time.</p>
<p>Shi Gong seemed to pay special attention to the supplement, so I was often summoned to discuss everything at that time. He once said to me with a smile: "Don't underestimate the small newspaper butt, it is very important to the circulation of the entire newspaper." Under his constant supervision, I dared not do my best. Now, more than ten years have passed since the day Shi Gong was killed. Recalling his last words, I am very sad!</p>

<p>"Ziyoutan" Seventy-fifth Anniversary Special Issue</p>
<h3>"Ziyoutan" in the Past Thirty-six Years</h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>Counting on my fingers, "Ziyoutan" has a history of thirty-six years. In the Chinese newspaper industry, a newspaper that can stand firm for decades is rare. And a newspaper supplement that can stand firm for decades along with the growth of the newspaper is even rarer. If there is one, it is only "Ziyoutan."</p>
<p>We cannot say that thirty-six years is a long time, but in these thirty-six years, in terms of the domestic situation, it was the most important period of change in Chinese history. The Chinese people experienced the Xinhai Revolution and were liberated from the oppression of the Qing Dynasty. They experienced the Northern Expedition and awakened from the oppression of the warlords. They also experienced the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and raised their heads from the oppression of imperialism. It includes the entire history of the Republic of China. At the same time, in the Chinese newspaper industry, these thirty-six years were also a period from the formation to the enrichment of the modern Chinese newspaper industry.</p>
<p>And "Ziyoutan" grew and thrived in these thirty-six years. In any issue of "Ziyoutan," you can smell the atmosphere of that era. In these thirty-six years, "Ziyoutan" has also experienced vicissitudes of life: it used to be a place for the Saturday School to talk about love, and it used to be a place for new writers to fight fiercely. The published texts ranged from qin, chess, calligraphy, and painting to European and American styles, from game ink to self-cultivation sketches, almost all-inclusive. However, although the style and content have changed again and again with the evolution of the times, there is only one principle that has remained unchanged - that is, it has always been a veritable "Ziyoutan," talking freely, without prejudice, and without restraint!</p>
<p>"Ziyoutan" is not only the longest-lived supplement in China, but also the earliest supplement to appear in China.</p>
<p>When we narrate the history of "Ziyoutan" here, we must mention the origin of Chinese newspaper supplements. Newspapers have been publishing some poems and essays for a long time, mostly attached to the news. The Tongwen Hubao, published in 1900, included a "Tongwen Leisure Record" with the newspaper, which was completely in the style of a small newspaper and not the form of a supplement to a major newspaper. But the establishment of a formal supplement started with "Ziyoutan."</p>
<p>On the first day of the seventh lunar month of the third year of Xuantong in the late Qing Dynasty (August 24, 1911), the Shen Bao authorities announced a reform of the editing policy with the motto "The world is progressing day by day, and human affairs are becoming more and more complicated," taking into account both seriousness and liveliness. Ziyoutan met the readers on this day. Initially, it was edited by Wang Dungen, and most of the published articles were game texts, such as "Overseas Anecdotes," "How Can This Be True?" and "For Your Amusement," as well as some poems and parallel texts, and overlapping-character poems, etc., and long-form translated novels were serialized every day. At that time, the target was the general gentry class and business people in the society, and the content was limited to entertainment texts after tea and dinner.</p>
<p>From March 18th of the fourth year of the Republic of China, Wu Juemi took over the editing work, and the editing policy remained the same as before. He once solicited poems and articles from soldiers to stimulate the national spirit of martial arts.</p>
<p>After a year, Yao Yuanchu took over the editing work of "Ziyoutan" (April 1, 1916), and slightly changed the content of "Ziyoutan," focusing on old literature, publishing the most poems and articles from the Nanshe Society, which became a unique garden for Nanshe Society members to publish their poems and articles for a time. In addition, a small garden called "Ziyoutan's Ziyoutan" was opened.</p>
<p>Yao Yuanchu edited for a full six months, and from October 31st of the same year, it was taken over by Tian Xuwo Sheng (Chen Xuyuan). At that time, in addition to publishing sketches and essays, he also published some texts such as "Family Common Sense," so that this supplement not only allowed readers to appreciate its texts, but also gave readers practical benefits, which was quite popular with readers at that time.</p>
<p>In addition to managing the literary career, Tian Xuwo Sheng was also committed to national enterprises. After the seventh year of the Republic of China, Tian Xuwo Sheng had become an entrepreneur. Therefore, Xu was edited by Chen Lengxue (that is, Mr. Chen Jinghan, the publisher of this newspaper). Mr. Lengxue's moral articles have always been admired by the world, and his sharp and powerful short comments have long been well-known in the Chinese newspaper industry. At this time, "Ziyoutan" focused on short and精悍short comments, which hit the current malpractices and were deeply loved by readers. (Above)</p>
<h3>Eulogy</h3>
<p>— Ji Qiu'an</p>
<p>The saying goes: There is nothing difficult in the world, only afraid of people with hearts. Knowing that the world's successful things can only be done by those with hearts, but those with hearts for themselves will have small success, and those with hearts for the public will have great success. There are only journalists who have hearts for the public and work tirelessly every day, collecting all things and spreading them across the world, day after day, line after line, and endlessly, from self-cultivation, family management, governance, and peace in the world. Everything is complete. And especially filial piety, brotherhood, loyalty, trust, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the main points. Every time there is an editorial, it is explained in detail. Although it is in a noisy and competitive world, it still contains the style of morality and propriety, such as Speaker Pan's commemoration of the Double Eighth Father's Day. Your newspaper sincerely praises it, making people know that filial piety should be done to the fullest. Those who see it feel it is the essence, knowing that the sky has not lost this article. Therefore, those who are trusted by your newspaper's editors use Dong Hu's pen and Li Lou's vision. Many scholars gather in one hall to draft, discuss, modify, and embellish, each doing their best. The manuscript is published as soon as it is received, and when it is published, it is made public. Therefore, reading your newspaper, you can know the affairs of the world without going out, how happy is this! Therefore, wherever your newspaper goes, everyone says "Old Shen Bao," neither rigid nor soft, neither biased nor leaning, and many people compete to read it. From west to east, from south to north, no one is not convinced. In terms of recording events, it can compete with the national history for glory. In terms of merit, it can be compared with Gan Tang. Moreover, it was founded early and has a long history. Among the same industry in the country, there is no one like it. Even if we examine the countries, it is rare. Since its publication, it has reformed politics, improved culture, prospered commerce, and developed reclamation and animal husbandry, all of which have been guided in detail. It also advises people not to do good because it is small, and not to do evil because it is small, hoping that the world will be full of good people, turning the national fortune to prosperity and the people to live and work in peace. The intention is like this, how great is the merit! And especially not afraid of trouble, day and night, like a Bodhisattva saving people from suffering and difficulties, watching the waves of humanity, wanting to quickly help the world, wanting to use a brush to spread the Yangzhi branch, to purify the world, to solve the upside down, and to promote this ambition, can be against heaven and earth, can be against gods, can be against the world, its merit and virtue are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, what is it like! Therefore, all people of insight know that your newspaper is celebrating the 75th anniversary of its founding and the publication of its 25,000th issue, and they have launched a joint celebration ceremony to celebrate the middle newspaper. The friendship is deep and the meaning is profound. It is also the way to receive grace and not forget it. Your newspaper is selfless, presenting everything and giving it to others. This is truly the beauty of being happy alone is not as good as being with others, and being happy with a few is not as good as being with the masses. Mencius said: Boyi is the pure one among the sages, Yi Yin is the responsible one among the sages, Liu Xiahui is the harmonious one among the sages, and Confucius is the timely one among the sages. Looking at all the newspapers, purity, responsibility, and harmony are all available, and all can be in the ranks of sages, but your newspaper alone has obtained its time and can be passed down with the timely sages. The timely sages are always respected for thousands of generations, and I think your newspaper is also like this. Therefore, on the occasion of the life of your newspaper, I also respectfully praise it and say:</p>
<p>The life of your newspaper is as long as the Southern Mountain.</p>
<p>May all of you enjoy this.</p>
<p>Li Qiu'an respectfully presented on August 15th, 36th year of the Republic of China, at the age of 69.</p>
<h3>Editor's Message</h3>
<p>Happily celebrating the 75th anniversary of this newspaper, standing in the position of an editor, I cannot but say a few words.</p>
<p>"Free Talk" has had a glorious history. Precisely because it has had a magnificent journey, the editor feels the responsibility is all the more arduous.</p>
<p>Every day, when you sit at the desk, you come into contact with all kinds of readers, accusing you of the darkness of society, blaming you for the hardship of life, calling out to you for the corruption of the wealthy. In the lines of text, sometimes you can see their tears, sometimes you can breathe in their anger and resentment.</p>
<p>After eight years of the War of Resistance, everything is still on the road to recovery, and many situations of separation and chaos are naturally unavoidable. All the unsatisfactory situations, we can say with certainty, will definitely slowly get better. The decayed will surely die, and the newborn will surely grow. Metabolism - this is the inevitable development of history. During the "transformation" period of the summer cicada, the mother body naturally feels great pain.</p>
<p>The Chinese people are now in this state of being neither fully alive nor fully dead. We should look forward to the future. Under the blue wilderness, with golden clouds filling the sky, there are naturally beautiful sceneries.</p>
<p>颓丧 · 消沉 (Dejection and depression), this is a shameful term. The more difficult a person's life is, the more he will appreciate the meaning of life.</p>
<p>From the founding of "Free Talk" to now, it has been thirty-six years and one month. In these long years, you can see how much fighting spirit it contains.</p>
<p>The future focus of "Free Talk" is still to cooperate with the newsworthiness and strengthen the introduction of science and knowledge. Wise readers and authors are expected to give us greater assistance.</p>
<p>In the past few months, the editor should thank many authors for taking the time to write for this publication. We should sincerely express our highest gratitude!</p>

<h3>Familiar People Don't Follow Etiquette</h3>
<p>--Wei Zhuang</p>
<p>There is a Western saying that means: "Familiar things are inevitably despised." The newspapers we see every day seem like very close friends in our daily lives. Because we are used to seeing them and are familiar with them, we don't take them seriously. Moreover, due to the close relationship, we unknowingly develop the habit of being disrespectful.</p>
<p>People often say that the arguments in newspapers are always clichés, neither painful nor itchy; the records in newspapers inevitably repeat what others say, being all the same. These opinions and criticisms are understandable from the perspective of general readers. However, in all fairness, newspapers are like a recording machine of society, and like a mirror. What they produce and reflect cannot be separated from the real environment of society. Only with a stable society can there be an ideal newspaper. Ragged wool cannot weave a beautiful carpet, so we cannot solely blame the newspaper for not making progress.</p>
<p>The *Shen Bao* was born on this day seventy-five years ago. If we compare it to a person's life, seventy-five years has already exceeded the age of seventy, and it can be said to be a sign of longevity. Not to mention domestically, even among the famous daily newspapers in the world today, its peers in 1872 are likely only the American "Bosten Globe" (the German "Berliner Tageblatt" was also founded in the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, but it is unknown whether it still exists). Even based on the principle that rare things are precious, it is worth our attention!</p>
<p>In the past half-century of unscientific China, it is a miracle in our cultural history and academic circles that the *Shen Bao* has been able to remain intact and grow to this day. How many famous universities in China are as old as the *Shen Bao*? None. Which academic research institution in China has a history like that of the *Shen Bao*? None either... In the past turbulent and unstable seventy-five years, the *Shen Bao* has served society and spoken for the people in a steady and unyielding spirit, enduring hardships, struggling to survive, and forming a leading transportation agency with a sense of public community (Gemeinschaft). The *Shen Bao* calls itself "the oldest," which it truly deserves, and it is only natural that we give it due respect.</p>
<p>Given the vastness of China's territory and the size of its population, even ten or a hundred *Shen Bao* would not be too many. However, the current reality is not so. Society should show more care for newspapers, needless to say. As for the so-called new newspapers that are emerging, they should be well nurtured so that the foundation of China's newspaper industry is more solid and far-reaching.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Familiar people don't follow etiquette." Although the *Shen Bao* is an old friend we see every day for ten or several decades, on this occasion of its seventy-fifth anniversary, when we see it in the morning, we seem to need to express some respect in our hearts.</p>
<p>The highest leader has instructed us to respect the elderly and love the young. May readers fully understand this point!</p>
<h3>Trivial Recollections of an Old Shen Bao Employee</h3>
<p>--Retired Old Soldier</p>
<p>The *Shen Bao* "elder" is seventy-five years old this year. The twentieth of this month is her big birthday. All the colleagues of this newspaper are offering her a toast for longevity, which is very pleasing.</p>
<p>But this "elder" was originally an American, born and raised in Shanghai. It was not until the 30th year of Guangxu (?) that she acquired Chinese citizenship, so she can be considered a Chinese. Therefore, while it is appropriate to commemorate the "elder's" seventy-fifth birthday, I believe the year she joined the Chinese nationality should especially be commemorated, as she has only been fully considered Chinese for forty-five or six years.</p>
<p>The *Shen Bao* was originally founded by the American company Meizha, and was an American Chinese-language newspaper. The Chinese manager was Xi Junzimei. After Zimei's death, his disciple Zipei took over. In the 30th year of Guangxu, the company had no intention of running the *Shen Bao*, so it was taken over by Xi Junzi Zipei. Thus, the *Shen Bao* began to break away from American nationality and formally entered our country's territory.</p>
<p>After Zipei bought the *Shen Bao*, he wanted to make major changes, so he invited Jin Junjianhua to be the editor-in-chief, and Zhang Junjiqi, my brother Yunhe, and I to be editors. Others, such as Sun Yusheng and Lei Junyao, were all old employees of the newspaper. The translator was Yan Junjunqing (?). Yan Jun had a limp, a gun wound on his forehead, and carried a walking stick. He would arrive late in the evening, and the tea servant would immediately place a chair next to his desk, and bring him Western newspapers such as *Shi Lin* and *Wen Wei*. Yan Jun would smoke a cigar, open the newspapers and orally translate five or six telegrams, or as many as six or seven. The one in charge of writing was mostly Lei Junyao. The time was no more than half an hour or so, but the treatment was exceptionally good. At that time, the eight-legged essay era, English was quite valuable. Unfortunately, Yan Jun did not work for long before leaving. He was succeeded by Lu Jundaquan, and later by Yan Yiting.</p>
<p>The address of the *Shen Bao* was originally at the east end of Jiangxi Road on Sanma Road, where the offices of various bureaus of the current municipal government are located, opposite the so-called Red Church. The typesetting room and the editorial department were both upstairs, separated by a public alley. A hemp rope was tied across the window, with a tin can tied to the end of the rope. Manuscripts for typesetting were all placed in this can for sending and receiving, and proofs were also handled in the same way. At that time, the most important news was nothing more than official documents and memorials from senior officials in various provinces. Other news, such as "local news," was also very scarce, or simply used what had been collected by others. As for "local news," theft and fires were already excellent material. However, the daily essay was required to be 1,200 characters, no more and no less. The plates were set every day before dinner. How different it was from nowadays, when work must be completed by four or five in the morning.</p>
<p>At that time, I was fascinated by English and not interested in a reporter's career. I only worked as a writer for a year or so. Then, the governor-general of Liangjiang, Wei Guanglian, opened a higher school in Nanjing, so I resigned from the newspaper and entered the school. Before long, my brother also left the *Shen Bao* to go to Japan to study education. Upon his return, Mr. Zhi Zanxi founded the *Southern Newspaper* at the intersection of Jiangxi Road on Sima Road, inviting us to take on editorial duties. Zanxi was the brother of Consort Zhen. Because Consort Zhen lost favor with the Empress Dowager Cixi and fell into a well to die, Zanxi took refuge in Shanghai and founded this newspaper. Unexpectedly, because it published the happy news of Prince Zhen's marriage to the famous actress Yang Jiexi, Prince Qing was furious and telegraphed the governor-general of Liangjiang, Duan Fang, to order its closure. At that time, Prince Qing was a Grand Councilor and concurrently the Minister in Charge of Foreign Affairs, and was greatly relied upon by the Empress Dowager Cixi. There was no way to resist, and the *Southern Newspaper* had to die prematurely at that time.</p>
<p>At that time, the *Shen Bao* had moved to Wangping Street, originally the address of the Youyicun Western restaurant. The editor-in-chief, Sun Jundongwu, felt that there was a shortage of editors in the office. Hearing that the *Southern Newspaper* had closed, he strongly urged me and Xi Junzi Zipei to go there. Zhi Jun still intended to organize a new newspaper and asked me not to take other jobs. I refused because of the relationship. Xi and Sun insisted again and again, and I finally agreed, but I asked to rest at home for two months before coming to work, partly to rest and partly to see what Zhi Jun was up to. After I returned home, the incident of Xu Xilin assassinating the Anhui Governor Enming occurred, and Zhi Jun's plan to reorganize was not realized for a while. So I re-entered the *Shen Bao* for the second time. My brother Yunhe also re-entered the *Shen Bao* the following year. At that time, the organization of the *Shen Bao*'s editorial department was still very simple. There were few editors, and one proofreader also served as a news editor, so often the editing and proofreading were done by one person. At this time, I was most diligent in my duties as a reporter. Unexpectedly, in the third year of Xuantong, I developed a disease and left the office to recuperate. After more than a year of not recovering, I finally resigned.</p>
<p>In the ninth year of the Republic, I entered the *Shen Bao* again. This was the third time I entered the *Shen Bao*. At this time, the *Shen Bao* building was located where it is now. The shareholder and manager was Mr. Shi Liangcai. He had taken over from Xi Junzi Zipei in the first year of the Republic. Every time I enter the *Shen Bao*, it moves once. Every time I enter the *Shen Bao*, it also prospers once. The advancement of the giant wheel of the times is truly endless.</p>
<p>Note: I am quite forgetful. I cannot remember the years and months clearly in this account, and there may be errors in the names, but in general, they are not too far off.</p>
<h3>Mr. Pan Gongzhan Encourages the Colleagues of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>--Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>Although the history of the newspaper business in China is less than a hundred years old, this newspaper has occupied 25,000 issues over seventy-five years. This newspaper has undeniably fulfilled a major part of its responsibility in promoting China's modernization. Around the Xinhai Revolution and the Northern Expedition, newspaper people promoted public opinion with sincere revolutionary enthusiasm, overthrowing autocracy and sweeping away warlords. After the start of the War of Resistance, people in the news media shed blood and sweat in the occupied areas and the rear, fighting hard to support the government's long-term war of resistance policy. In the past two years, newspaper people across the country have been working towards the goal of national unity and construction after the war. In short, every time the opportunity arrives, news reporters have stood at the forefront, unafraid and unwavering, fulfilling their greatest responsibility. As we commemorate this newspaper's anniversary, I will briefly state my personal feelings about the newspaper business, in order to encourage myself and my colleagues.</p>
<p>A news reporter is an extremely heavy and arduous profession. But in recent years, the progress of the news industry and the rapid increase in practitioners have shown that more and more people have developed an interest and confidence in this work. Why is this? Because everyone has come to realize that the news business is a meaningful and valuable job that has a great impact on the future of the country and human civilization. The meaning of life lies in seeking to serve the majority and benefit the majority, like a torch, igniting the brilliance of one's life to illuminate the future for thousands of people walking in the darkness. To achieve this goal, the news business can be said to be the most ideal job. Because a news reporter's word or sentence can affect hundreds of thousands or even millions of readers and generate great power.</p>
<p>Precisely because of this, we news reporters must be more cautious and vigilant. If we report a false message or express a wrong view, imagine the adverse consequences it will have on society. Therefore, we news reporters bear not only a professional responsibility, but also a moral and social responsibility. A news reporter must never rely solely on his own likes and dislikes, or indulge in temporary emotions; we should consider the mission it bears to society and the possible impact of any word or sentence, always taking into account the entire environment. We should guide people on the right path, report more constructive news, so that they can always see the bright prospects ahead, and encourage the upward power of the whole society. Only in this way can a news reporter truly assume the responsibility of correct public opinion.</p>
<p>Achieving this goal is not an easy task. It requires knowledge, cultivation, experience, and courage. So I often feel that, although the qualifications of news reporters have not yet been clearly defined, it is more difficult to be a good news reporter than to engage in any other profession. Now there are news reporter associations in all parts of the country, but there has never been a clear legal provision on what qualifications are required to be a news reporter. Other freelance professions, such as doctors, lawyers, and accountants, have strict requirements for their qualifications. In the education sector, whether it is a university professor, lecturer, or primary and secondary school teacher, they must be approved or certified. Only news reporters have no regulations. In this case, I hope that our news reporters can cherish their sacred position. Since we cannot prove that we are qualified to be a news reporter based on clear qualifications, we must prove that we are qualified to be a news reporter based on the facts of our work. We should constantly review and reflect on our words and deeds, establish a good reputation in society, and gain their confidence. Only then can we exert the leadership role of news reporters in society. News reporters must first respect themselves in order to gain the respect of others.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, being a news practitioner is not an easy task. It requires knowledge and experience, as well as a high degree of service spirit and courage. In today's news technology with increasing progress and news competition becoming increasingly fierce, I feel that a good reporter should at least possess the following four characters.</p>
<p>The first character is: "True". The prerequisite for news is truth. News that deviates from the truth is nothing more than a rumor. Untrue news, whether intentional or unintentional, is inexcusable. Any news we collect must be done to the best of our ability, to find ways to determine whether this news is true. This kind of judgment sometimes relies on the confirmation of other news sources, sometimes on one's own understanding and observation of the matter, and sometimes on one's own knowledge and experience of a certain issue, to compare and verify with the news obtained, in order to determine its truth. In short, we must make the most thorough judgment in the fastest time, so that only true and valuable news appears in the newspaper. It must be known that an untrue message, or an untrue view and criticism arising from it, will affect the reputation of one's own news report and give people a bad impression, as far as the newspaper itself is concerned. In terms of external impact, to a small extent, it harms the reputation of a person, a thing, or a certain group, making it difficult for people to clear up even if they make corrections; to a large extent, it may even cause social unrest and instability, affect the security of the entire country, and even lead to international suspicion and disputes, which is not impossible. From this, we can know how important the truthfulness of news is. News reporters should have the confidence and sincerity to pursue the truth; news should seek its "truth," which is indeed the first condition for being a good reporter.</p>
<p>The second character is: "Swift". Due to the invention of radio and radio facsimile, the progress of modern communication technology is rapid. The most important thing about news is its timeliness, so speed is also an essential condition for a news reporter. Modern newspaper competition is very fierce, so after a reporter obtains accurate news, he must notify the newspaper by phone, telegraph, or radio in the fastest way possible. Before the end of this World War, when the Allied forces landed in Normandy and crossed the Damtain River, reporters from all armies used every means to send the news to their newspapers three or five minutes earlier than others, and broadcast it immediately in order to gain time. But the "swift" character we are talking about here must first have the first "true" character in order to have value. Because only true news is worth reporting quickly; otherwise, if we want to be fast and rashly send out news that has not been confirmed to be true, only to find out that it is unreliable, and then send a telegram to cancel or correct it, it is not only a great waste of materials, but also a great loss of credit. If it has already been published and there is no time to correct it, wouldn't it cause even more adverse consequences? Therefore, this "swift" character must go hand in hand with the "true" character to have value; "swift and detailed", neither can be missing. How to find ways to verify the truthfulness of news in the shortest time, and then send it out in the fastest way, is a question that a news reporter should pay close attention to and study.</p>
<p>The third character is: "Careful". This is especially important for those who are engaged in editing work. As mentioned above, since the impact of newspapers is so great, when we decide whether to publish a piece of news, we should not only consider whether it is beneficial to our own newspaper, but also consider the possible impact of the publication of this piece of news on groups, society, or the country. Sometimes, we clearly know that this news is true and swift, but for the sake of the whole society and the country, we are afraid that it will have adverse consequences, and we would rather give it up. Newspapers are a social undertaking, bearing the important mission of social culture, so we must never be like general commercial companies, who sell goods as long as they are profitable, and never ask whether customers may suffer losses. Our newspapers have such a great impact on society and such a heavy responsibility, so we should carefully weigh the pros and cons and weigh the importance of any news we publish in order to determine whether to adopt it or not. A person who works as an editor must have extremely clear judgment in this regard.</p>
<p>The fourth character is: "Diligent". Diligence is a necessary condition for success in any matter, but the "diligent" character possessed by a news reporter must include three aspects, namely: diligent in work, diligent in learning, and diligent in reviewing. The so-called diligent in work means that he must make the greatest effort to enable his own duties to achieve the expected results, so that every part of the organic nature of the newspaper can reach the ideal state. The so-called diligent in learning means that a news reporter must not forget to improve himself in his work, so that he will never lag behind. The development and progress of world thought, knowledge, and science is very rapid. If we do not diligently learn from time to time, but only stick to our own work, then as a result, we will definitely feel that we are out of touch with the times and lagging behind the times. Only knowing work and not knowing learning can never be a good news reporter for a long time. Therefore, news reporters must embrace the spirit of "daily renewal and daily renewal," and maintain close contact with world trends and cultural knowledge at all times, learning in work and using learning to assist work. Finally, speaking of diligent in reviewing, it is also very important. On the one hand, we must constantly review our own work to see if there is anything that can be improved; on the other hand, we should also review the advantages and disadvantages of our own newspaper, and make a comparison with other newspapers. Moreover, we should also try our best to welcome the review of our newspaper by the general public. What news does others have that we don't? Is it because we neglected to interview it? Or is it because we feel that it is not suitable for publication or not worth publishing, so we automatically delete it? What are other people's advantages and disadvantages? We must understand other people's advantages in order to see our own shortcomings and find ways to remedy them; we must also see other people's shortcomings in order to understand our own advantages and preserve and promote them. This kind of review work on one's own work and the entire newspaper is what a good news reporter must do.</p>
<p>If a news reporter can understand the sacredness of his mission and the importance of his responsibility, and at the same time strive to achieve the conditions of these four characters, "True", "Swift", "Careful", and "Diligent", in his work, then, I think, he will surely become an ideal news reporter, and he will surely be able to strive for the brightness of his career and the strength of the country in his own work position. On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of this newspaper, I have especially recorded these few words to share with my colleagues in this newspaper.</p>

<h3>The Old Shen Bao</h3>
<p>Newspapers are historical material of the contemporary era. Whenever later generations wish to know the course of an event or the important endeavors of a person, newspapers contain detailed records. However, the news published in newspapers occurs at any time and is recorded sequentially. If there are interruptions, it will inevitably be incomplete. Therefore, the value of collecting newspapers and periodicals lies in persistence, without allowing interruptions.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao has been published for seventy-five years. This period coincides with a time of dramatic change in China, with successive foreign troubles. In politics, it went through the Reform Movement of 1898, the Xinhai Revolution, and the Northern Expedition before laying the foundation for democratic politics. It also experienced the Second World War, during which our country fought the Japanese invaders alone for eight long years, and half of our country's territory was lost and regained. In economics, steamships, trains, and other Western material civilizations flowed into ancient China, changing China's mode of production. Social systems also fell into a state of chaos, with traditional old ethics abandoned by the youth, while new morals have not yet been established. Therefore, everything shows a sudden change.</p>
<p>To investigate China's domestic and international political situation, society, economy, cultural relics, and systems in recent decades, newspapers are the best material. This newspaper has a longer history and records more events, and it focuses on cultural aspects, which has attracted the attention of modern historians. Therefore, the complete set of Shen Bao from the past seventy-five years is not only a record of the development of this newspaper but also an important document for modern China and the world. The seventy-five-year-old Shen Bao currently stored in this newspaper's archives is the biggest asset and a priceless treasure of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Currently, according to the author's knowledge, there are two complete and intact sets of the Shen Bao from the past seventy-five years. One is stored in this newspaper, and the other is in the Xujiahui Library. Collecting is a kind of interest, and maintaining that interest for a long time is not an easy task. It is even more difficult for descendants to inherit the aspirations of their ancestors if a person cannot complete the task in their lifetime. Furthermore, there have been frequent changes and unrest in the past seventy-five years, and people's livelihoods have been unstable, making it difficult to prevent collections from being scattered. Libraries are public undertakings and can collect for a long time. However, when this newspaper was founded, it was the early stage of modern Chinese culture, and there were not many libraries, and they did not know how to collect newspapers. The copy in the Xuhui Library is indeed rare.</p>
<p>Not only did others not know how to preserve this complete collection of the modern historical document that is the Shen Bao, but this newspaper itself did not preserve it well. Because when Medhurst founded the Shen Bao, he was entirely focused on business and did not regard it as a very precious document. Perhaps he did not expect the Shen Bao to have such a long history and become a respected elder in the Chinese newspaper world. Therefore, at first, they only asked about making money, only cared about publishing, and did not know how to preserve it. This is really a laughable matter.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao that we now collect, complete and intact, was made possible by the great kindness of Mr. Zhang Zhongzhao. Mr. Zhang is an old friend of the Shen Bao. Since the publication of the Shen Bao, Mr. Zhang has purchased and read it every day and cherished it after reading. From the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty until the Xinhai Revolution, he never stopped for forty years. After Mr. Shi Liangcai took over this newspaper, he regarded it as a great regret that he published the newspaper but could not preserve it himself. Therefore, he published an advertisement publicly requesting a complete set. Mr. Zhang immediately presented his forty-year collection and returned it to this newspaper. The kindness and enthusiasm of Mr. Zhang will be forever remembered by this newspaper, and his contribution to the preservation of modern cultural relics is indelible.</p>
<h3>Brief Announcement</h3>
<p>We are delighted to celebrate the anniversary of the newspaper. Today, we are publishing an additional three and a half pages for this commemorative special issue. We are grateful to the founding fathers of the Party and the country, and to the scholars from all walks of life, for their kind contributions of articles or calligraphy. We are deeply moved by your lofty sentiments and friendship. Due to space limitations, we were unable to include everything. We express our deepest apologies and boundless gratitude.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the 25,000th Issue of the Shen Bao</h3>
<p>— Shi Yonggeng</p>
<p>Seventy-five years have passed since the Shen Bao was born. Comparing it to a human life, it is older than I am. I feel that my experience is not deep enough to trace back to the distant past; even with my knowledge, much is vague. On this auspicious occasion of commemoration, I only feel a sense of lingering reluctance. To be asked to express my thoughts is like a circle without end. I will, therefore, offer a few humble observations.</p>
<p>The entire Shen Bao can be divided into two periods: the period before my late father, Liangcai, took over, and the period after my late father's management. I do not know the details of the first period. Based on my understanding, I rely on Mr. Guang's account. My late father said that he dedicated his life to the newspaper industry, so he spared no effort to exert his mind and energy to approach it and put his heart and soul into it. If a plan was not perfect, he found it difficult to enjoy his meals, and if a review was accidentally omitted, he would stay up all night. At that time, the two gentlemen, Chen Jinghan and Zhang Yunhe, were powerful assistants to my late father. Mr. Chen maintained an impartial and unbiased attitude, holding a just opinion without fail. Mr. Zhang maintained a consistent spirit, never faltering or yielding, for thirty years. This enabled my late father's ambitions to be further developed, and the future of the Shen Bao became increasingly promising. I once heard my late father say, "Without Mr. Chen Guangsheng's fair and just arguments, the Shen Bao could not have gained the support of a large number of readers. Without Mr. Zhang's peaceful and comprehensive measures, the colleagues could not have achieved a harmonious effect from top to bottom." This was not just my late father's personal opinion, but something I alone heard in the courtyard, and it is agreed upon by all the people of the newspaper. Anyone who is familiar with the actual situation can recognize this as an immutable assessment. Other gentlemen, such as Zhang Zhuping and Wang Yingbin, put their heart into the business management of the newspaper, not leaving any stone unturned, and their contribution cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Now the Shen Bao has reached its 25,000th issue. The abundance of the autumn harvest is guided by cultivation; the magnificence of the new building is due to the hard work of the builders. My late father and Mr. Zhang both gave their all but were unable to personally witness this grand occasion. Recalling the past, how can one not feel a sense of sorrow! Fortunately, Mr. Chen is still responsible for the distribution of the Shen Bao, and the two gentlemen who have recently presided over the affairs of the newspaper, Pan Gongzhan and Chen Xunjin, one is an old colleague of my late father, and the other is an outstanding figure in the newspaper industry. It is expected that the Shen Bao will be able to achieve even greater heights in the future. I am incapable and unable to carry on the legacy of my predecessors. In the midst of shame and bewilderment, I can only follow behind these gentlemen and wait to see their success!</p>

<h3>The Rebirth of the Shen Bao</h3>
<p>The Japanese invaders' surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on "January 28th" broke the silence of the Pacific Ocean; the isolated Shanghai also sank with the waves of the Pacific Ocean. The opinions of the Shen Bao were originally regarded as a thorn in the side by the enemy and puppets. At this time, they wanted to use the seventy-year-old brand of the Shen Bao and forcibly ordered it to resume publication. Soon after, they sent the traitor Bin Jie to implement a forced takeover. From then on, this Shen Bao with a long history was controlled by the enemy and puppets and temporarily fell into a dark period.</p>
<p>The firecrackers of victory eliminated the black curtain that had been shrouded, and it returned to its former brightness. The Shen Bao also began its rebirth. The Shen Bao, which had been held by traitors for three years, was like a person suffering from all kinds of illnesses and needed to be properly treated and recuperated. The central government was particularly concerned about this historically important newspaper and appointed Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan as the instructor and chief editor, and Legislative Yuan member Chen Xunjin as the general manager and editor-in-chief, to carefully plan the reorganization. It was officially re-launched on November 22, 1945. In May 1946, the guidance period expired, and it was returned to the company. On May 15, a joint meeting of directors and supervisors decided to appoint Pan Gongzhan as president and editor-in-chief, and Chen Xunjin as general manager and editor-in-chief. Since its reorganization, the Shen Bao has taken on a new look, and its organization has become more sound.</p>
<p>After the Shen Bao resumed publication, the editorial department strived to enrich the content and made every effort to expand the news network. Local news was collected through a collective interview system, which was both economical in terms of manpower and time and achieved great results. Special correspondents, reporters, and correspondents were stationed in various cities, large and small, in other parts of the country. In foreign countries, major cities in Europe, America, Southeast Asia, and Japan also had reporters from this newspaper, who maintained close contact with the editorial department. Due to careful coordination, the layout of each edition became more substantial and vivid.</p>
<p>In addition to news, great attention was also paid to photographs and illustrations. There were several photojournalists in this city who took photos at any time for application. Correspondents and reporters in other places also often provided news photos for publication in various editions. In addition, the New York Times was specially contracted to provide foreign news photos to match international news. The publication of a large number of photographs made it easier for readers to understand the news, and the layout was particularly lively.</p>
<p>The archives were also greatly expanded. A large number of Chinese and Western books and magazines were added, old and new books and newspapers were sorted, and biographies and photographs of celebrities, as well as overviews of various institutions and societies, were collected for reference during editing.</p>
<p>After the Shen Bao resumed publication, the sales volume increased sharply, reaching as far as Suining, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Xikang. In order to facilitate readers in remote areas, a photo-offset edition was published, which was only two-fifths the size of the original edition, making it easy to send by air and reducing the burden on readers, while also being clear, beautiful, and more suitable for collection. Unfortunately, it was interrupted due to printing issues, but it is hoped that it will be restored soon.</p>
<p>Since July of last year, in order to promote the sale of domestic products, the Shen Bao, at the request of major manufacturers, has organized a joint grand giveaway, which has been held for five months. The number of participating manufacturers has increased from more than twenty to eighty, and the total value of the giveaways issued has reached 250 million yuan. Starting in August this year, manufacturers are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Shen Bao and the publication of its 25,000th issue by repeating the giveaway.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Shen Bao often received many photographs from various places. In addition to a small number of them being published in the newspaper, the majority could not be published due to space limitations. On New Year's Day this year, the Shen Bao held an exhibition of current affairs photographs in Hangzhou, which caused a sensation throughout the city of Hangzhou. Following this, exhibitions were held in Nanjing, Suzhou, Nantong, Fuzhou, Taiwan, Beiping, and other places. Each place was a grand occasion. Before the exhibition was held, Nanjing often had current affairs photographs displayed in its office, which were changed every week. The Hangzhou Youth Center also regularly exhibited them. Photographs are the most vivid and authentic records, and especially in China, where education is not yet widespread, they are more likely to attract audiences. These photo exhibitions of the Shen Bao have great educational significance. In addition, the West Lake Museum in Hangzhou requested a complete set of photographs from the Shen Bao regarding the convening of the National Assembly to preserve these meaningful historical documents. The Directorate General of Posts also requested photographs from the Shen Bao to serve as the basis for designing stamps. These two events further increased the value of current affairs photographs.</p>
<p>Using radio to broadcast news is also a new work created by the Shen Bao. Compared with European and American countries, the sales volume of newspapers in our country is very small, which is because there are too many people who cannot read the newspaper. After eight years of resistance against Japan, people are more concerned about national affairs than before, but other than occasionally hearing a little bit, they cannot obtain it. In addition to its existing readers, the Shen Bao seeks to enable more people to acquire current affairs knowledge. Starting on March 17, it cooperated with 18 private and public radio stations in the city to broadcast news three times a day, morning, noon, and evening, which has been well received by all sectors of society. Especially the news of the National Army's attack on Yan'an. The Ministry of National Defense received a phone call from Xi'an at 4:30 that afternoon, while Shanghai radio stations broadcast the news from the Shen Bao at 6:00.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao's use of radio to broadcast news expands the scope of the newspaper from a plane to a three-dimensional space, which is a great achievement. It then held a special all-day broadcast on Sundays, which was held in rotation on various radio stations. The content included weekly current affairs reviews, celebrity speeches, local correspondence, science lectures, social services, and other items, with the main goal of spreading culture, combined with noble music and entertainment programs to promote proper entertainment.</p>
<p>In addition to its own business, the Shen Bao also attaches great importance to social undertakings. In the past, it has organized many social undertakings with great success. After the resumption of publication, the work of social service continues. In addition to the medical and legal advisors who are regularly published in the newspaper, it has successively organized midwifery campaigns, tuberculosis X-ray examinations, relief funds for the orphaned, widowed, poor, and sick, and fundraising for the bereaved families of martyred journalists. Recently, it has also organized a scholarship campaign with a target of one billion yuan. Donations have been pouring in in recent days, but the number of students who have applied is very large. The target of one billion yuan is still not enough to distribute to everyone.</p>
<p>Seventy years is a rare age in life, but from the perspective of a career, seventy-five years is only a small part of the entire career. The Shen Bao is the elder brother in the Chinese newspaper industry, but its spirit has not aged. Especially after the resumption of publication, it has become young again, regained its youth, is full of vigorous vitality, and is working hard to advance its career.</p>
<h3>Popularized News</h3>
<p>Although the writing of the Shen Bao in the early years did not cite classics, it was profound and elegant, and not everyone could fully understand it. Fortunately, the people who read the newspaper at that time were "all literate," and the editors prided themselves on their writing and elegance. It seemed that they were not concerned at all about the fact that many people could not understand the difficult language. However, the Shen Bao had long recognized that newspapers were a powerful tool for promoting culture. Therefore, in addition to this newspaper, it also published two more popular news publications: "Min Bao" and Illustrated News.</p>
<p>"Min Bao" was founded on the fifth day of the third lunar month of the second year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. It was published every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The news was written in vernacular Chinese, which ordinary literate people could understand. Its publication announcement stated: "This newspaper is specially set up for the people, so the sentences are like ordinary speech, and each sentence, as well as the names of people and places, are clearly marked, so that even those who are slightly literate can easily understand." This newspaper can be regarded as the ancestor of vernacular newspapers.</p>
<p>On March 31, 1936, the "Sixty Years Ago" column of the North China Daily News contained a passage about Min Bao. It stated, in brief: "We see that the Min Bao published by the Shen Bao is indeed a new type of newspaper. Its characteristic is that it is written in popular language, so readers can easily understand its content. At the end of each sentence, there is a space, and the people and places are marked with straight lines and dashed lines on the side. Anyone who has read two years of school can read it. Therefore, it can penetrate the stage that the Shen Bao cannot reach, such as shop assistants and laborers."</p>
<p>Pictures are news without words, which is easier to understand than newspapers in vernacular Chinese. Since 1930, the Shen Bao has issued an illustrated supplement, which is attached to the newspaper and has been well received. However, the earliest illustrated publications of the Shen Bao date back to the early years of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. In August of the third year of Guangxu, the "Yinghuan Pictorial" was founded, which published illustrated descriptions of world affairs and customs. It was an irregular publication, with more than ten pages per issue. The illustrations were drawn by famous British artists, and Cai Erkang added explanations. A total of five volumes were published. Starting in April of the tenth year of Guangxu, another pictorial was published, which was issued every ten days, with eight pictures in each issue, all of which were amazing and memorable events in the news. Because it was printed by Dianshizhai, it was named Dianshizhai Pictorial.</p>
<p>Sixty years later, education in our country is still not widespread, and there are still many illiterate people. Although the writing in newspapers has become very popular, there are still many people who cannot understand the newspaper. In recent times, the evolution of society, especially after eight years of resistance against Japan, has made many people eager to know about domestic and foreign affairs. Therefore, in the current situation, newspapers with popular writing and news reported with illustrations are still very much needed, and Zhong Bao can take on this responsibility.</p>
<h3>Literary Inquisition</h3>
<p>The responsibility of a newspaper lies in reporting news and promoting public opinion. In the late Qing Dynasty, when politics was not well-managed, criticism of public opinion was regarded as a thorn in the side. Therefore, the news of various government offices was strictly sealed off, and it was not easy to interview news involving military finance. There were even cases of literary inquisition caused by this.</p>
<p>At the turn of Guangxu and Xuantong, the number of newspapers gradually increased, and news competition was fierce. Beiping was the political source at that time, and all parties focused their attention on it. Therefore, all newspapers recruited personnel to interview news. At that time, the correspondent of this newspaper was Zhong Shenshu. Zhong worked in the Grand Council, and although his position was not very high, he could see one or two of the confidential affairs of the court. Therefore, as a secretary of the Imperial Chancellery, he won the title of "Little Grand Councilor," but the great prison also arose from this.</p>
<p>Zhong was very diligent in his duties. Since being hired by this newspaper, he sent a letter every day to report the news. Although only a glimpse of the inner workings was dared to be fully declared, the rare and secret news was enough to add color to this newspaper. One day, he suddenly received a private telegram stating that Zhong had been arrested for leaking secrets. His colleagues were extremely shocked, but there was no way to send a telegram to inquire about his safety. Tao, a driver at the telegraph bureau, was also arrested at the same time. Another person, Lei, was also implicated. Fortunately, he heard the news in Tianjin and hid in advance. Although he was not arrested, he suffered from neurasthenia due to shock. Zhong and Tao were initially sentenced to capital punishment, but fortunately, influential people interceded for them, and they were leniently sentenced to exile in Xinjiang. Zhong had a high reputation for talent and extensive social connections. Later, someone interceded for him, and he was released and returned after two years in Manchuria. Tao was not freed until the restoration. This great prison ended in this way, which was fortunate.</p>
<p>Zhong was honest and trustworthy and cautious in his work. The editors of this newspaper also carefully considered the news provided by Zhong before publishing it, thinking that he would not be imprisoned. However, the reason for this turmoil has always been unclear. It was only after someone talked about it that the inside story of this case was known to be an international conspiracy. At that time, Tsarist Russia was plotting to swallow up our country's northeast, so it used various methods to probe our country's secrets and formed a large-scale spy network. Tao and others were used by them, and Zhong was also implicated, which led to his imprisonment. It was not a real literary inquisition.</p>
<h3>The Best-Selling Day</h3>
<p>The sales volume of this newspaper has increased with the age of this newspaper, from hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands. But compared with European and American newspapers, which sell millions of copies a day, we are far behind.</p>
<p>In normal times, the sales volume of newspapers is always stable at a fixed number, and although there are slight differences, the number is very small. On Sundays, it is usually a little more, and on New Year's Day, National Day, and other commemorative days, the sales volume will also increase. Otherwise, there must have been a particularly major accident. I remember on the evening of August 11, 1945, Japan surrendered. The next day, all the newspapers in several major cities in the rear were snatched up. If you were late, you would not be able to buy them.</p>
<p>In the past, important domestic and foreign news did not arouse the interest of many people. What they were most concerned about at that time was the publication of the list of successful candidates in the provincial and metropolitan examinations. Those who participated in the examination, of course, wanted to know the results of the examination as soon as possible; the fathers and brothers were also very concerned about the fame of their younger brothers; even relatives and friends, as well as people from the same village, felt that knowing the people on the list was a very honorable thing. Therefore, the grand occasion on the day of the publication of the list of successful candidates in the provincial and metropolitan examinations was perhaps similar to the day of the announcement of the US presidential election. Originally, in the era of the imperial examination system, the so-called great Dengke was a major event in life.</p>
<p>The publication of the list of successful candidates in the provincial and metropolitan examinations was originally posted in front of the Ministry of Rites or the Academy. At that time, there were many people who specialized in the work of reporting the news, and they would report the people who had been admitted on the list to their families, relatives, and teachers in the fastest way, which could earn them a lot of rewards. Fortunately, this was a great happy event, and they were happy to spend a few taels of silver more.</p>
<p>After the publication of this newspaper, on the date of the publication of the list of successful candidates in the metropolitan examination or the provincial examinations in the provinces of Jiangnan, the list of admitted names was disclosed in the newspaper. Therefore, many people who were directly or indirectly related to the examination learned to buy it, and the sales volume on this day was particularly high, and the price was temporarily raised. At that time, although the sales volume of the Shen Bao was mostly in the Jiangnan area, the literary style in Jiangnan was always strong, and there were many people who were concerned about the publication of the list of successful candidates in the imperial examination. Therefore, this day became the best-selling day for the newspaper. This number is still very small compared to the current sales volume, but at that time, it was indeed very large.</p>
<h3>Zun Wen Ge (Respect News Pavilion)</h3>
<p>In the interview room on the third floor of the Shen Bao, there is a plaque with the three characters "Zun Wen Ge (尊聞閣)," meaning "Respect News Pavilion". According to the date inscribed, it was written in the eighth year of Guangxu, which is sixty-five years ago. When this plaque was inscribed, only Mr. Dai Yunqing, who is now an old colleague of the newspaper, had been born, but he was still at the stage of learning to walk! Its historical relationship with this newspaper can indeed be said to be not short.</p>
<p>The three characters "Zun Wen Ge" were written by Mr. Wu Jutan of Qiantang and were inscribed for the building of the Shen Bao. In the past, halls and study rooms often had inscriptions, especially literati, who liked to inscribe some elegant plaques. The Shen Bao is a place where literati and refined scholars spend their days and nights together, so it is naturally impossible to avoid customs. The three characters "Zun Wen Ge" contain the meaning of "respecting the news industry."</p>
<p>From the three characters "Zun Wen Ge," one cannot help but think of the building of this newspaper. At first, this newspaper was opposite the Hong Church on Hankou Road, which is now the site of the municipal government. It was an old-fashioned two-story building with a small room and a dim light all night long. Compared with today's tall buildings and magnificent structures, the distance cannot be measured. These three humble houses were the place where the early colleagues of the Shen Bao lived and rested, and the plaque of "Zun Wen" should have been hung there.</p>
<p>During the Xuantong reign, business became increasingly prosperous, and the old house was not enough to use. Therefore, it was moved to 263 Wangping Street. The three-story building there, although still a very old Western-style house, was much more spacious and brighter than before. This was the second home of the Shen Bao.</p>
<p>In 1913, after Mr. Shi Liangcai took over, he planned to build a new building to ensure permanence. As a result, he chose the corner of Hankou Road and Shandong Road, designed and drew the drawings, and built it. In 1918, the new building was completed, which is today's building. This new five-story steel and concrete building is magnificent in appearance and bright and spacious inside. In October of that year, the third relocation was made. The cost of this new building at that time was more than 700,000 taels of silver. However, due to the European War, the source of cement and steel was scarce, and the price was extremely high. The construction company suffered a loss of 100,000 yuan. Later, when Mr. Shi Liangcai learned about it, he generously donated another 50,000 yuan in addition to the construction cost to compensate for the company's losses.</p>
<p>Building its own building was initiated by the Shen Bao. At that time, building such a building could show the power and enthusiasm of the host for running the newspaper. Although many people sourly criticized it for being a waste, the industry was envious of it, especially the clean and hygienic toilets, which were "coveted" by the editors of various newspapers. At that time, Mr. Bao Tianxiao wrote novels for the Free Talk, so he had the right to enjoy these toilets. Many editors of other newspapers who knew Mr. Bao also took the opportunity to secretly solve the "convenience" problem, and the Shen Bao opened the door to convenience.</p>
<p>Ten years later, this five-story building felt insufficient again. Therefore, in 1930, a new building was added to the south of the old building. The height and style were the same as the old building, forming a U-shape. Last year, another floor was added to the platform of the new building, so now the front half is still five stories, while the back half is six stories.</p>
<h3>Foremen and Secretaries</h3>
<p>When the *Shen Bao* newspaper was first established, the editorial department was headed by Jiang Zhixiang, with He Guisheng and Qian Xinbo assisting in the editing duties. Later, Jiang Zhixiang succeeded in the imperial examinations and naturally no longer wanted to engage in the work of a frustrated intellectual. (People at that time all viewed the newspaper business in this way.) Thus, He Guisheng was invited to take charge, followed by Qian Xinbo and Huang Shiquan. In terms of accounting, the chief accountant was initially Zhao Yiru, followed by Xi Zimei. After Xi Zimei passed away, his disciple Pei Gang took over. This was the lineup of the *Shen Bao* at that time. Although it was just starting out, the key players were quite well-rounded.</p>
<p>The terms "foreman" and "secretary" are rarely heard now. However, in the *Shen Bao* of that time, under the management of foreigners, the people in the accounting and editorial departments were referred to as "foremen" and "secretaries."</p>
<p>Although they were honored with the titles of "foreman" or "secretary," their lives were very meager. At that time, the highest salary was only forty yuan, with the rest decreasing accordingly, and the lowest was only a little over ten yuan. Food, laundry, haircuts, and the cost of writing materials were all taken from this amount. Although the cost of living was still low at that time, it was still felt to be very difficult to make ends meet. It is said that He Guisheng's monthly salary was thirty yuan, and he loved buying books all his life, so half of his money was always spent on buying books, so he often found himself penniless. He had no choice but to go to the willow-lined pavilion alone every day, brew a pot of tea, and buy a few sesame cakes to satisfy his hunger, which could be compared to General Feng Huanzhang's life of eating large flatbreads and fried dough sticks.</p>
<p>At that time, not only were newspaper employees poorly paid, but also the place where they worked was very simple. Lei Zeng, an old reporter of this newspaper, once described the early situation of this newspaper, saying: "At that time, the *Shen Bao*'s buildings were very dilapidated. Only the office of the foreigners was spacious, clean, and tidy. As for the place where we resided and worked, it was no more than a few feet square, the light was dark, and eating, sleeping, and relieving oneself were all done in it. In winter, the cold wind was bone-chilling, and in summer, it was as hot as a furnace. The most unbearable thing was the large number of bedbugs breeding everywhere, which was very surprising. Often, one was disturbed all night and could not sleep." After reading these few sentences, one can also imagine the difficult living conditions of newspaper employees in those years.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>When this newspaper was compiling "The Most Recent Fifty Years," the editors said something like this:</p>
<p>"Shall we commemorate fifty years? Then the person must be at least fifty years old to be qualified as an editor. And within twenty years of age, it is the year of life for seeking knowledge, even if there are hearings, it is still not dare to believe whether it is enough for writing materials. Then the editor of the 50th anniversary book must be at least 70 years old. And someday, when compiling the 100th anniversary book, how can we get some centenarians to spread their old pens!"</p>
<p>This year is the 75th anniversary of this newspaper. As the editor of "The Most Recent Fifty Years" predicted, it is a pity that there is no centenarian to write this brief history for him. What is written now can only follow the old example of historians, and everything that cannot be seen or heard is relegated to the category of "hearsay."</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang Yunhe (Mo) in his article "The *Shen Bao* in the Past Sixty Years," the ancient history of the *Shen Bao* is:</p>
<p>"At the end of the Tongzhi reign of the former Qing Dynasty, an Englishman named Ernest Major established a company in Shanghai, and the *Shen Bao* was one of its businesses. At that time, there were no newspapers in Shanghai, and Major was the first to establish one. From our perspective today, we must think that he had some ambition, or wanted to manipulate public opinion, or wanted to invade culture. However, Major at that time did not have such a profound meaning. He simply regarded it as a type of business and facilitated his commercial publicity. Therefore, after its establishment, everything was entrusted to Chinese managers, and the first person to write the articles was Jiang Zhixiang."</p>
<p>This was the beginning of the publication of the *Shen Bao*. It was actually on the 23rd day of the third month of the Ren Shen year of the Tongzhi reign of the former Qing Dynasty, which is April 30, 1872, in the Western calendar. At that time, there was more than one founder. Mr. Hu Daojing said in the history of the 66th anniversary of the *Shen Bao*:</p>
<p>"The *Shen Bao* was jointly established by Englishman Major and his friends C. Woodward, W.B. Pryer, and John Wachillop. Each person contributed four hundred taels of silver as capital. On May 19, 1871, which is the first day of the fourth month of the tenth year of the former Qing Dynasty, a contract was signed to establish a Chinese-language daily newspaper."</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lei Yao (Guan) in his article "The Past Conditions of the *Shen Bao* Newspaper," the people in the newspaper were:</p>
<p>"The location of the newspaper was east of Hankou Road in the British Concession. It is said that the first Chinese manager was a Mr. Zhao from Zhejiang, so the chief writers he hired, such as He Guisheng and Qian Xinbo, were all from Zhejiang."</p>
<p>The so-called Zhao from Zhejiang refers to Mr. Zhao Yiru. Mr. Huang Shiquan (Xie Xun) said in his article "The Experience of the Early Days of This Newspaper":</p>
<p>"The chief writers in the newspaper were successively Mr. Jiang Zhixiang, Mr. Qian Xinbo. After Xinbo resigned, I took over his position. The person in charge of translation was Mr. Bi Linna (H.A. pereira), assisted by Mr. Dong Yunsun. The person in charge of accounting was Mr. Zhao Yiru and Mr. Xi Zimei. After Zimei died, his disciple Pei Ji took over. This was the situation when the Westerners were the owners of the newspaper."</p>
<p>However, Major soon had no intention of operating the newspaper anymore. Mr. Huang said:</p>
<p>"At that time, the sales volume of the *Shen Bao* became more and more prosperous. Major happily said: My energy has been exhausted, and my reputation has been promoted. With the profits I have gained from the *Shen Bao*, I have added the Dianshizhai Stone Lithography Bureau, the Tushu Jicheng Letterpress Printing Bureau, the Suichang Match Factory, and the Jiangsu Medicinal Water Factory, and all have successively achieved success. It is time to retire gracefully, so I changed the *Shen Bao* Newspaper into a company, and then sailed back to my home country."</p>
<p>After Major left, there was still a small transitional period. Mr. Lei said:</p>
<p>"In the Ding You year of Guangxu twenty-three (1897), Major returned to his country after making a profit. The head of the company was Englishman E.O. Abuthnot, and the translator was Portuguese Bi Linna. The Chinese manager was still Mr. Xi Zimei, and the chief writer was Mr. Huang Shiquan. The overall power of the entire newspaper was controlled by the English head. However, the head was not familiar with the Chinese language, and when there were matters to be discussed, they were all translated by Bi Linna. Mr. Bi was the key to communicating between China and the West and connecting the upper and lower levels."</p>
<p>The recovery of this newspaper and its management by the Chinese was actually on the 13th day of the fourth month of the first year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty, which is May 31, 1909, in the Western calendar. It had been 37 years since Major founded it. Mr. Zhang recorded the process:</p>
<p>"Mr. Jin Jianhua from Qingpu and Mr. Lei Yao from Songjiang catered to the new trend and succeeded Mr. Huang Shiquan as the head of the writing department. Also, because the head of the company, although he was isolated from the Chinese political situation and did not interfere much, it was very dangerous for a country's public opinion organ to be controlled by foreigners and not be free and independent. Therefore, they strongly urged the Chinese manager, Mr. Xi Zipei, to negotiate with the Westerners to recover the newspaper. The head of the company discussed it with the directors and agreed to transfer all the assets of the *Shen Bao* Newspaper to the Chinese for a price of 75,000 yuan, and Mr. Xi signed the contract with them. From this point on, the *Shen Bao* was completely in the hands of our Chinese people."</p>
<p>Soon after, Mr. Jin and Mr. Lei also left the newspaper, and Mr. Zhang became the head of the writing department. Not long after, the revolution was successful. In the early years of the Republic of China, the first major event in this newspaper was the takeover by Mr. Shi Liangcai. Mr. Zhang recorded the process:</p>
<p>"After the establishment of the Republic of China, the whole country was full of the atmosphere of innovation, and the people were happily looking forward to the boundless development of the future. The *Shen Bao* was also at this time changed hands. Mr. Shi Liangcai entered the newspaper as the general manager and hired Mr. Chen Jinghan (Leng) as the chief writer. After Mr. Shi entered the newspaper, he planned all administrative affairs and recruited several people who were committed to doing things to help him, and gradually expanded the newspaper's affairs. Mr. Chen gradually reorganized the editorial department. Therefore, at this time, the *Shen Bao* was even more prosperous and developing upwards in great strides."</p>
<p>Mr. Hu also said:</p>
<p>"In 1912, the first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Xi Zipei sold the *Shen Bao* Newspaper to Mr. Shi Liangcai. The contract was signed on September 23 of the same year, and the handover was on October 20. Mr. Shi took the position of general manager himself, adopted new methods, and used new people. The business increased even more, and he became the leader of the Shanghai newspaper industry."</p>
<p>The general management office of this newspaper was established in January of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932) as the highest authority in charge of the entire newspaper. The internal organization was completely new. Unfortunately, Mr. Shi was killed on the Shanghai-Hangzhou road on October 6 of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934). The newspaper lost the figure who presided over the overall plan, so the board of directors was organized to replace the authority of the general manager. After another three years, the July 7th Incident occurred. Mr. Hu said:</p>
<p>"If there is something to say, it is long. If there is nothing to say, it is short. Speaking of July 7, 1937, our country launched a full-scale war of resistance against the violent Japanese. On August 13, the war in the eastern battlefield began. Our army fought in Shanghai for three months and withdrew the entire army according to the predetermined strategy, luring the enemy to go deep. Except for the concessions, the entire city of Shanghai fell into the hands of the Japanese. At this time, the Japanese army was arrogant and jealous of the Chinese newspapers still publishing in the concessions, so they organized a puppet news censorship office and notified the Chinese newspapers to send the newspaper samples for inspection from December 15 of that year. They also notified the concession authorities that the Chinese newspapers that did not send the inspection would be closed. The newspapers were angered by righteousness and would rather die than surrender. Either before or at the time limit, they all automatically announced a temporary suspension of publication. The *Shen Bao* was published on December 14, 1937, and stopped publishing after the 23,208th issue. On December 14, the *Shen Bao* published a clear announcement: "Due to environmental reasons, the publication will be suspended from December 15. This is a notice for public review."</p>
<p>"When the war was going on in Shanghai, the *Shen Bao* had moved part of its printing machinery to Hankou, preparing for the *Shen Bao* to be published in Hankou to continue its mission of encouraging the national spirit. The *Shen Bao*, which had been published for 65 years, stopped publishing in Shanghai. The Hankou edition was actively promoted and published until January 15, 1938. On March 1 of the same year, the Hong Kong edition was issued in Hong Kong, and the two places were published at the same time.</p>
<p>"From August 1, 1938, the Hankou edition of the *Shen Bao* ceased publication. The machines were moved to Guilin, intending to be published in Guilin, but it was not realized. At this time, the resumption of the Shanghai newspaper had begun.</p>
<p>After Shanghai fell, the Chinese newspapers run by British and American businessmen in the concessions still adhered to justice and tried their best to report accurate news and encourage the spirit of the Chinese people. The Japanese were not satisfied with this third country's industry that upheld justice, but they could not infringe on it. The Shanghai *Shen Bao* was then contracted by the American Columbia Publishing Company. It was republished on October 10, 1938. Shanghai and Hong Kong were published at the same time."</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, this newspaper has been in a dark age. It was not until the 34th year of the Republic (1945) that it was able to see the light of day again and reorganize. The resumption of publication on December 22 said:</p>
<p>"The *Shen Bao* has done some small work for China's press, cultural circles, and even the general public in the past. Except for the temporary suspension of publication in the 26th year of the Republic (1937) due to the withdrawal of the national army to the west, there has never been a suspension of publication in its publication record. However, since the Pacific War, the *Shen Bao* has been kidnapped by the enemy and puppets, and its actions have lost freedom. Although the *Shen Bao* is still published after that, it is not an expression of the *Shen Bao*'s free will, and it is invalid in law and in principle. Therefore, the *Shen Bao* is republished today, and its issue number is based on December 8, 1941 of the Republic of China." "In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the national army withdrew to the west and the Shanghai concessions were still preserved, we not only relied on American businessmen to avoid being subdued by the enemy, but also published in Hankou and Hong Kong one after another. In the meantime, Jin Huating, a reporter for the *Shen Bao*, was assassinated by the enemy and puppets. Other colleagues, either were subjected to coercion and refused to surrender, or suffered hardships but did not change their integrity, all of which are enough for our *Shen Bao* to always retain righteousness."</p>
<p>The resumption of publication was the 24,338th issue, and today is exactly the 25,000th issue. From the 11th year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty to today, it has been 75 years. When this newspaper entered the 10,000th issue, it was still on February 14 of the 27th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. The topic of the commentary on that day was "The First Issue of This Newspaper," which said:</p>
<p>"It is hoped that China will learn from the past and strive to reform, promote all benefits, and eliminate all waste."</p>
<p>In the 11th year of the Republic of China, this newspaper published a commemorative book "The Most Recent Fifty Years" on the 50th anniversary. Chen Jinghan wrote an article "A Review of the Reporter's Life in the Past Twenty Years," which contained several sentences:</p>
<p>"In the first ten years, I had only one thought about newspapers. I often thought to myself: What must I do so that people will read my newspaper? In the next ten years, I had another thought about newspapers: What must I do so that people will benefit from reading my newspaper?"</p>
<p>In his article "The *Shen Bao* in the Past Sixty Years," Mr. Zhang quoted this sentence and said: "It is a famous saying and a great truth, not only for the colleagues who are commemorating the 60th anniversary today, but also for the press in the future 600 years and 6000 years, it will not be changed."</p>
<p>The publication of the 20,000th issue was on November 19, 1928. Mr. Chen also said:</p>
<p>"The *Shen Bao* is the epitome of history, and the *Shen Bao* is a history museum. Although it is an overstatement, I hope that from the 20,000th issue, it will gradually reach 100,000 and 1 million issues, and it will always serve the public and advance to become a world history view."</p>
<p>On July 21, 1932, this newspaper created the *Shen Bao* Monthly to commemorate the 60th anniversary. In the inaugural speech, we said in our mission:</p>
<p>"We must fulfill the mission of culture and economy, take the increase of public happiness as a prerequisite, and move forward to reach the bright and prosperous avenue."</p>
<p>Finally, we still quote a few words from the resumption of publication speech:</p>
<p>"The construction of a democratic country should be based on fair public opinion. The *Shen Bao*'s resumption of publication has no lofty ideals, but it is willing to make faithful reports of news for readers. When publishing an event or making a statement, it must be carefully considered whether it is beneficial to the people and the public, and whether it is beneficial to the overall situation of the country and the world."</p>
<h3>Original Report of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>The modern Chinese newspaper industry was started by foreign merchants, and the *Shen Bao* was born under these circumstances. On May 19, 1871, the Englishman Ernest Major, along with his friends Woodhead, Palamede, and Varchiro, signed a contract to found a Chinese-language newspaper—namely, the *Shen Bao*. However, the inaugural issue of the *Shen Bao* was actually on April 30 of the following year, and this year marks its 75th anniversary. After Major founded the *Shen Bao*, it was not until 1909 that it was taken back by Chinese people and run independently. Therefore, for one-third of its 75 years, it grew up under the management of foreign merchants. When writing the history of the *Shen Bao* today, this earliest period cannot be omitted.</p>
<p>When this newspaper was first published, it was at a time when domestic wars were gradually ceasing. At the same time, the pressure from foreign forces was not yet strongly felt. The people, having finally caught their breath, believed that they could live in peace from then on. Those in official circles were still busy running around and scheming, seeking wealth and status. The general scholars were engaged in writing stereotyped essays, obsessed with the path of the imperial examination. The *Shen Bao*, in this environment of superficial peace, also took this as its guideline for editing and selecting materials. At that time, the content of the *Shen Bao* included imperial edicts, Beijing gazettes, and palace gate transcripts, reporting news from official circles. It also included examination questions for various levels of exams, for the reference of scholars. In addition, there were poems and songs, which were works of famous scholars who, inspired by the moment, composed verses about the wind and the moon. The so-called "news" was actually fire alerts, murder cases, strange stories, and odd events from various places, which were only suitable for people's after-dinner conversation. The more decent part was an essay, equivalent to the current editorial, but the subject matter was not related to current affairs, and the writing was extremely pedantic. Even so, it was still inevitably denounced as reactionary! At that time, the sources of news domestically were only a few major cities that had reporters stationed, while foreign news was all translated or reprinted from Hong Kong newspapers. At the same time, due to inconvenient transportation, the date of an event occurring was at least a week or ten days away from the date it was published in the newspaper. For distant places, it was even more than a month. This kind of record had already lost its news value. Fortunately, most of what was published was social news, so the timeliness was less important. At the same time, readers' mentality was to treat them as fictional stories.</p>
<p>At that time, the *Shen Bao* was not only very empty in content but also extremely rigid in form. A large sheet of *maotai* paper was printed on one side. The whole sheet was divided into eight sections, each section being about 20 centimeters high, and a little space was left between the two sections for folding. The text was all printed in No. 4 lead type, and the headlines were also the same, while advertisements were changed to No. 5 type. Except for the headlines of essays and important texts, which were listed on a separate line, ordinary news headlines were only separated from the main text by one space. Such a newspaper looked very much like a remnant leaf from a woodblock book, antique and fragrant, making people "feel nostalgic for the past." But under the conditions at the time, it was already very difficult to achieve this.</p>
<p>When the *Shen Bao* was first published, it came out every other day. From the fifth issue (May 7, 1872), it was changed to daily publication, but Sunday was suspended. It wasn't until April 27, 1879, that the newspaper was also published as usual on Sundays.</p>
<p>The year 1881 was a new turning point in the history of Chinese transportation. On December 24 of that year, the telegraph line between Shanghai and Tianjin was completed. At that time, people thought that being able to transmit books and letters from a long distance of three thousand *li* through telegraph lines was an unprecedented miracle. At the same time, people's concept of time was still very weak at that time. Unless there was a very urgent matter, they would not bother with this new tool. Before the telegraph was connected, Major notified the Tianjin reporter that in the future, decrees of the Qing court could be transmitted by telegraph. From then on, the Beijing gazette, which could only be received every six or seven days, could be received on the same day and published in the newspaper the next day. This was the first time that the Chinese press used telegraph to transmit news. Three years later, the telegraph lines between Beijing and Tianjin were also established. At that time, major events in the imperial court were sometimes also transmitted by telegraph. Thus, news gradually appeared in a truly "new" form.</p>
<p>Two years after the publication of the *Shen Bao*, Japan used the pretext of the murder of Taiwanese aborigines to send troops to attack the aboriginal communities. This was good news material, so Major personally went out to investigate the news and collected historical facts and local customs about Taiwan and coordinated them with the news, publishing them together in the newspaper. At that time, most readers mainly focused on entertainment, and people in official circles might pay a little attention to political news, but it was also very limited. Since Major used this novel material, it greatly aroused readers' interest, and sales increased sharply.</p>
<p>In 1884, French troops invaded Vietnam. Major, considering that the news of the Japanese attack on Taiwan in the past was very popular with readers, decided to make great use of this Sino-French War. So he hired a Russian as a reporter to interview news in the French military camp and transmitted it by telegraph from Hong Kong to Xiamen to Shanghai. The following year, when French warships attacked Ningbo, the *Shen Bao* still sent Russians there. At that time, China's war was unfavorable, but other newspapers were deeply silent. Only the *Shen Bao* reported accurate news. At first, many people thought that the *Shen Bao* was biased towards France, but later it was proved that the *Shen Bao*'s news was correct, and sales increased greatly. At the same time, advertising customers came in droves, and the original space could no longer accommodate them, so only additional pages could be added.</p>
<p>When the *Shen Bao* was first published, it was at a time of great change in China. This opportunity could be used, but it was also the most difficult to deal with. The *Shen Bao* was published in an environment of lack of materials and simple equipment, and there were few readers. It happened to encounter two wars, and the *Shen Bao* seized the opportunity and laid the foundation. With the increase in sales, the paper also gradually improved. The original *Shen Bao* was printed on *maotai* paper. After publishing the truth about the Japanese attack on Taiwan, sales increased to several thousand, and *maotai* paper was no longer applicable. From September 11, 1874, it was changed to printing on seralian paper. By 1884, due to the Sino-French War, sales increased again, and it was necessary to abandon the handmade seralian paper and switch to machine-made glossy paper. The Opium War opened the door to China, but most people, except for those with clear minds, were still not awake. By the time of the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, people's hearts were shocked; the Reform Movement of 1898, with the massacre of partisans, shocked people's hearts again; the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, with the Eight-Nation Alliance entering Beijing, shocked people's hearts again. After three stimulations, the people were like waking up from a big dream, and they realized the faintness of the court and the corruption of politics. They realized the trend of the world's currents. New ideas and new insights came one after another, and many newspapers followed this path. At that time, Jin Jianhua and Lei Junyao, who assisted the *Shen Bao* in writing, had very novel ideas and tried their best to cater to the trend and planned reform measures. This was thirty-four years away from the initial publication, exactly half of the seventy-five years.</p>
<p>In January 1905, at the end of the 30th year of Guangxu, the cadres of the whole newspaper office discussed for two days and two nights before deciding on the reform plan. From February 7, they met the readers with a new posture. The new look of this newspaper, in terms of form, expanded the space to two pages, front and back, arranged in two columns, and used larger typefaces for the headlines to make them eye-catching. In terms of content, news was valued, and correspondents were hired in major cities and towns in various provinces to collect news, especially about transportation, commerce, and entertainment, which was more detailed. In European and Western countries, reporters were also recruited to inquire about international situations. At the same time, for important news, all places where telegraphs were available were transmitted by telegraph so that readers could see it quickly. In terms of editorials, in order to meet the needs of the times, in addition to the regular writing of the main writer, if there were insightful current affairs essays from the outside world, they were also selectively published to gather opinions and expand benefits. At the same time, texts from various Western newspapers were translated for reference.</p>
<p>The sudden change in the tone of the *Shen Bao*, which had always been considered old and heavy, surprised everyone. At that time, the ideas of society were divided into two factions, one advocating reform and the other advocating conservatism. The reform of the *Shen Bao* caused the ideas of the two factions to converge. Conservatives, seeing that the attitude of the *Shen Bao* had also changed, felt that the general trend was that reform and self-strengthening were necessary. And reformers, believing that the *Shen Bao*'s arguments also expressed sympathy for them, further enhanced their new strength. Indeed, that reform of the *Shen Bao* made many people look at each other in surprise.</p>
<p>Major founded the *Shen Bao* purely for profit, so all editorial matters were completely handed over to the Chinese to handle. The earliest chief writer was Mr. Jiang Xiangzhi, and the successors were Mr. He Guisheng, Mr. Qian Tingbo, and Mr. Huang Shiquan. The people who acted as editors were successively Cai Chongjiu, Cai Zhifo, Yao Zhujun, Zhang Xiaoxuan, Qian Minglue, Lai Huisheng, Liu Hebo, Jin Jianhua, Lei Junyao, Zhao Menglin, Pan Zhengqing, Huang Xiansheng, and Shen Yinjie. Only the Portuguese Bili Na presided over the translation affairs. On the management side, the first was Mr. Zhao Yiru. After Mr. Zhao passed away, Mr. Xi Zimei was invited. After Zimei died, his disciple Pei took over.</p>
<p>The businesses run by Major in Shanghai, in addition to the newspaper, included the Suichang Match Factory, the Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Factory, the Tushu Jicheng Printing Bureau, and the Dianshizhai Printing Bureau. Even the newspaper office itself, in addition to publishing the newspaper every day, also engaged in publishing as a side business. (1) Editing and printing comprehensive monthly magazines, such as "Yinghuan Suoji," "Siming Suoji," and "Huanyu Suoji," specializing in publishing essays, novels, poems, and lyrics. (2) Editing and printing the popular "Min Bao," specially for women, children, business people, and people who could not understand high-level texts to read. (3) Editing and printing "Yinghuan Pictorial," selecting interesting world events and customs, drawing them into pictures, and briefly adding explanations, which was the originator of Chinese pictorials. Because it was printed by Dianshizhai, it was called Dianshizhai Pictorial. (5) Using movable lead type to print pocket-sized series of books, which pioneered the trend. More than 100 kinds were printed successively, including reprints of old ones and publications of new ones, among which there were quite valuable materials. At the same time, the meticulous proofreading and clear printing can also be compared with the Qing Dynasty Wuyingdian edition, known as the *Shen Bao* Juzhen edition. Some of them were also published by the Tushu Jicheng Printing Bureau.</p>
<p>In 1889, Major suddenly had the idea of returning home. So he reorganized the businesses he operated into Major Limited, including the Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Factory, the Suichang Automatic Fire Factory, the *Shen Bao* Newspaper Office, the Shenchang Bookstore, and the *Shen Bao* Newspaper Office's buildings and land. The assets were estimated to be 300,000 taels, divided into 6,000 shares. Major recovered the original capital, converted it into 2,000 shares, and sailed back home. The company affairs were changed to be handled by directors Abornot, McBain, Mackenzie, Liang Jinzhi, and manager Finlin. At that time, Chinese people had obtained part of the shares of Major Company, so Mr. Liang was also listed as one of the four directors.</p>
<p>In 1909, the directors of Major Company planned to sell the *Shen Bao* to expand the Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Factory. Manager Xi Zipei then took over the *Shen Bao* at a price of 75,000 yuan. From then on, this most historic opinion organ completely belonged to the Chinese people. At this time, it was 37 years since Major founded the company, and the era of foreign merchants in the newspaper office came to an end.</p>

<h3>Mr. Shi Liangcai's Career</h3>
<p>If the era of Major is regarded as the founding period of the *Shen Bao*, then Mr. Shi Liangcai's management is the period of improvement and expansion of the *Shen Bao*. The reason why the *Shen Bao* was able to become a large enterprise and occupy an important page in the history of Chinese journalism is all due to Mr. Shi's efforts.</p>
<p>In the first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Shi Liangcai took over the *Shen Bao* for a price of 120,000 yuan, serving as the general manager. He invited Mr. Chen Jinghan as the chief writer and Mr. Zhang Zhuping as the manager, adopting new methods, recruiting new people, reforming the layout, and enriching the content. The atmosphere was completely new. Business was booming, and it began to move towards the path of development.</p>
<p>When the revolution was first completed and the republic was founded, a new atmosphere filled the whole country. The people had infinite expectations for the future of the country and the nation. Soon, the European War broke out, and there was a desire to know about the current situation of the new world and China's position in the international arena. Then, the May Fourth Movement occurred, and the need for new culture and new knowledge among young students became even more urgent. The *Shen Bao* also followed the trend of the times, catered to the needs of readers, and made improvements. In addition to editorials and news, it also set up various columns.</p>
<p>From August 31, 1919, the "Weekly Supplement" was created, which translated essays and important news from foreign newspapers and magazines, and systematically introduced international affairs to supplement the daily international news. From June 1, 1920, the "Common Sense Supplement" was added, with content including economics, health, science, municipal administration, customs, etc., to instill in the people the ordinary knowledge they should have, and to work harder to promote the Three Principles of the People. From February 8, 1924, the "Local Supplement" was republished, dedicated to serving all sectors of the local community, publishing the activities of various social undertakings in Shanghai, and advertisements for theaters and shops.</p>
<p>The earliest special issue was the "Automobile Supplement", which began on November 27, 1921, publishing news about highway construction and articles about the use of automobiles. "Education and Life" began on December 8, 1924, and was evolved from the "Education and Life" weekly magazine published in 1923, discussing ways to improve education. In 1925, a new column called "Art World" was opened in the Local Supplement, publishing news and reviews about art, sports, painting, music, dance, photography, and songs. After that, there were also economic special issues, national goods weekly magazines, medical weekly magazines, radio weekly magazines, construction special issues, etc., which were published successively to satisfy the readers' wishes.</p>
<p>From May 18, 1930, the "Picture Weekly" was added, published once a week, and was in charge of the famous reporter Mr. Ge Gongzhen. Mr. Ge had rich experience and selected materials very carefully. Moreover, it was printed on copperplate paper with rubber plates, which was even more beautiful. The *Shen Bao* had previously compiled and published Yinghuan Pictorial, Dianshizhai Pictorial, etc., which were the pioneers of pictorials, but with the progress of the times, stone-printed pictorials had tended to decline, so photographic plate-making replaced drawing, and rubber plates replaced stone printing.</p>
<p>After the founding of the Republic of China, the political situation was unstable and internal strife arose. Because Yuan Shikai claimed the title of emperor, there was the Yunnan Uprising; because the military governors were tyrannical, Zhang Xun took the opportunity to restore the monarchy, and there was the Machang Instructor; Duan Qirui was in power, and a chasm arose between the north and the south, and there was the Hengyang Uprising, and the southwest had the War of the Constitution. Then there was the Zhili-Fengtian War and the Shandong War. The domestic split became more and more serious, the political situation deteriorated day by day, commerce was depressed, finance was exhausted, bandits rose up, and the people were in dire straits. Until the National Revolutionary Army vowed to launch the Northern Expedition and established its capital in Nanjing, the overall situation gradually stabilized, and when the Northeast changed its banner, the great cause of unification between the north and the south was completed. The railway transportation was used by the newspapers to promote this, but every time there was a war, the railway was interrupted once. The rapid telegraph communication was relied on by the newspapers to develop, but every time there was a war, the telegraph communication was inspected once. The *Shen Bao* felt extremely difficult to cope with in this environment, but fortunately it was handled properly, and it was able to develop further in the stormy waves.</p>
<p>The *Shen Bao* worked hard to seize the door with the environment, so as not to fall behind the trend of the times. In addition to improving the content of the newspaper, it did its best to do everything that could increase the efficiency of the newspaper, such as the construction of large buildings and the purchase of new equipment. The *Shen Bao* Newspaper Office was originally located in the west of Hankou Road and Jiangxi Road, which is now part of the Shanghai Municipal Government Building. During the Xuan统 period of the Qing Dynasty, it moved to Shandong Road, which was slightly wider than before, but with the increasing development of business, the old house was no longer sufficient. It was gradually felt that renting private houses was not a long-term solution, and it was not suitable for the use of newspaper offices. For a permanent solution, it was decided to build its own building. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, it bought the base at the corner of Hankou Road and Shandong Road, and engaged in design and drawing, and construction, which is now the *Shen Bao* Building.</p>
<p>The new building started construction in the fifth year of the Republic of China and was completed in the seventh year of the Republic of China. It was moved in in October of the same year. The exterior of the house was magnificent and the interior was refreshing, costing 70,000 taels of silver. The Shanghai newspaper office also started with the *Shen Bao*. When the new building was not yet completed, the owner of the Shandong Road house urged it to move out for some reason. Therefore, a small house opposite was used as the business department, while the editing and printing departments were set up on Tianjin Road. It was inconvenient to travel back and forth between the two places, and the houses were cramped.</p>
<p>This five-story new building had more than 100 rooms inside, which was indeed more than enough at that time. However, the newspaper office's business expanded day by day, and the number of employees increased day by day, and the office space became smaller. Therefore, in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, a new building was added to the south of the old building, and the old building was combined into a 口 shape. Last year, a layer was added on the platform of the new building. Therefore, the front half is still five floors, and the back half has been changed to six floors.</p>
<p>After the completion of the new building, the printing equipment was also greatly renovated. The original machines of the newspaper office could only print 4,000 copies of newspapers per hour. However, sales increased day by day, which could not be handled by the original machines. Moreover, in order to make the news flow smoothly, the news manuscripts must be compiled at midnight and published at dawn, so as to catch the early train and transport them to other places. The printing time was only one or two hours. Therefore, in the year after the completion of the new building, the latest printing machine was ordered from the United States. In the eighth and tenth years of the Republic of China, three more units were added successively. Therefore, more than 100,000 copies of newspapers can be completely printed within two hours. In addition, copperplate machines, typecasting machines, paper plate machines, lead plate machines, and lead type copper molds were also purchased successively, and the equipment became more and more perfect, and the efficiency increased day by day.</p>
<p>The 21st year of the Republic of China was the 60th anniversary of the *Shen Bao*'s founding. When people reach their sixtieth birthday, they must raise their glasses to celebrate, and the *Shen Bao* has been operating hard for 60 years, not only establishing a foundation, but also making progress day by day, and its history is precious. On September 1, 1931, the museum "used this" year as a commemorative year, and planned to make new contributions to readers. It was announced on September 1. "First, start with the reform of the newspaper itself, and gradually promote it to various affiliated businesses.</p>
<p>How to reform the newspaper? The "Declaration of the 60th Anniversary of This Newspaper" published on September 1 explained the *Shen Bao*'s future direction: (1) Strive to promote new scientific knowledge to encourage the Chinese people's interest in research. (2) State the world's economic situation and dissect the economic characteristics of our country to seek the path to be taken in the future. (3) Investigate the problems of various social problems in view of the current contradictory phenomena to seek solutions. (4) To be sincere To the government, fulfill the public opinion. (5) Assist young people to solve difficulties and make progress on the healthy and pure road. (6) Discuss the plan and problems of immigration and border colonization, and urge them to realize it. (7) Awaken the Chinese people's understanding of our country's international situation, seek to get rid of the shackles of unequal treaties, and promote our country and nation to the position of freedom and equality."</p>
<p>In addition to improving the newspaper itself, affiliated businesses were also established one after another. In terms of publication, the *Shen Bao* Monthly, the *Shen Bao* Yearbook, the *Shen Bao* Map, and the *Shen Bao* Series have made great contributions to culture. The *Shen Bao* Monthly is a comprehensive magazine of politics, economy, and literature and art. It has been published since July 1931, stating the domestic and international reality and pointing out its trends to supplement the daily newspaper. Later, with the changing world situation, publishing once a month was considered too long. Therefore, in 1936, it was changed to a weekly magazine. In order to popularize it, in addition to retail subscriptions, it was also sent with the newspaper, which is the same as the weekly version of foreign newspapers. The yearbook collects important political, economic, and social events in the country for one year and makes a systematic narrative, with various statistics attached, which is a chronological history of our country's national conditions. From 1933 to 1936, a large volume was compiled and printed every year. The *Shen Bao* Series has been compiled and published since 1933, with the theme of world current affairs and various knowledge, and is also used to supplement newspaper materials. The publication of new maps is the most important item in the publishing business. Mr. Ding Wenjiang, Weng Wenhao, and Zeng Shiying were hired to preside over it. They collected various precise materials and spent more than two years carefully surveying and mapping it. It was detailed and clear, and there was no better one at that time. The use of contour lines for coloring was a pioneering work. It is still a powerful figure in Chinese maps.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of social work, the *Shen Bao* Circulation Library, the *Shen Bao* News Correspondence School, and the *Shen Bao* Amateur Evening School were established one after another. The *Shen Bao* Circulation Library was founded in 1932 with thousands of books to provide vocational youth with proper entertainment and to increase their knowledge and skills. The *Shen Bao* Amateur Evening School is a sister of the Circulation Library, both of which are places for vocational youth to pursue further studies. When it was established in 1933, there were only two classrooms in the rest of the house of the Circulation Library in the mainland market, which could accommodate more than 80 students. Later, the number of students increased day by day, and branch schools were added. In less than two years, the number of students had increased to more than 2,000, and the number of branch schools had increased to as many as five. This shows that the youth's desire for knowledge is strong and the need is urgent. The establishment of the News Correspondence School was due to the lack of communication and communication among reporters in other places, so it was necessary to train them. Therefore, the school was established in 1932. The school used the correspondence method to train news personnel in various places. More than 800 students joined the school successively, reaching as far as India, Tibet, and Xinjiang. Many people from Europe, America, and Nanyang came to participate. This work not only has considerable gains for the *Shen Bao* itself, but also contributes more to local newspapers. Just as the *Shen Bao* was working hard to innovate and develop on the road of social culture, an unfortunate event suddenly occurred. On November 13, 1934, Mr. Shi was killed on the way back to Shanghai from Hangzhou along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Mr. Shi's death was not only unfortunate for the *Shen Bao*, but also for the national press, losing a talented person who could do great things. Fortunately, the internal organization of the *Shen Bao* was tight, and no impact occurred, and it continued to work for the cause. Many social and cultural undertakings organized by the *Shen Bao* on the occasion of its 60th anniversary were suspended one after another due to environmental reasons, and returned to their original positions, opening up a news network and enriching the content of the newspaper. Every year, people were sent to various places to collect data and write special articles, which was praised by all sectors of society.</p>
<p>On August 13, 1937, the war broke out. After three months of brave fighting by our army in Shanghai, the whole division was withdrawn for the sake of luring the enemy deep. Except for the concession, the whole city of Shanghai fell into the hands of the enemy. The enemy army was high-spirited and very jealous of the Chinese newspapers in the concession. They began to notify the inspection of new newspapers. The *Shen Bao* was angry and unwilling to be inspected by the enemy, so on December 15, it announced the suspension of publication. The *Shen Bao*, which has a history of 67 years, had to temporarily say goodbye to the readers of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Retrospective of Publication Business of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Over the past seventy-five years, in addition to shouldering the task of reporting news itself, this newspaper has also been able to adapt to the needs of the times and society, successively publishing various types of books and periodicals, year after year; it can be said to have fulfilled a considerable responsibility in promoting culture. Now, a brief description of the various publications published by this newspaper in the past is made as a commemoration of the "75th Anniversary" and in admiration of the hard work of our predecessors, and also as a glorious page in the history of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Juzhen Edition Books</p>
<p>During the period from the first year of Guangxu to the twentieth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, this newspaper used lead movable type to imitate the Qianlong "Juzhen Edition Series" to typeset and print new and old books. It is also called the Juzhen Edition Series (Note: In the thirty-eighth year of Qianlong, Emperor Gaozong of the Qing Dynasty ordered Confucian officials to compile the Yongle Dadian and other rare books and print them with wooden movable type, a total of one hundred and thirty-eight types, named "Juzhen"). More than one hundred and sixty types were published successively. As early as the eleventh month of the thirteenth year of Tongzhi, several types such as "The Scholars" had been printed and sold. During the period from the first to the fourth year of Guangxu, announcements were published to solicit contributions extensively. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Solicitation Announcement: This newspaper regularly prints and sells various books. If gentlemen from near and far have completed but unpublished works that they intend to publish, this newspaper is willing to purchase the manuscripts at a price and typeset and print them on their behalf. Alternatively, after the books are bound, dozens or hundreds of copies can be sent as a token of gratitude, which is also acceptable, depending on the salability of the book. Furthermore, if there are rare copies in the world that are suitable for reprinting, this newspaper can also buy them at a price or send dozens of newly printed books as a reward. The original manuscripts can still be returned after publication."</p>
<p>After receiving the manuscripts, they were generally published as soon as they were received. The content varied, mostly notes and miscellaneous records, but there were also quite a few novels in chapters. These series were printed using movable type, with a maximum of three thousand copies and a minimum of only one thousand copies. Moreover, they were disassembled after printing and could not be easily reprinted. To this day, there are probably very few copies left, making them extremely difficult to obtain. Fearing that readers would not be able to see the true face of the original books, a few types were selected and summaries were written for each to give a glimpse: Compilation of Treaties and Agreements, Six Volumes, Edited by Wang Chui</p>

<h3>Commemorative Publication of the Fiftieth Anniversary</h3>
<p>In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, it coincided with the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of this newspaper. Therefore, experts were hired to write and compile "The Most Recent Fifty Years." The content was divided into three sections: (1) The World in the Past Fifty Years, (2) China in the Past Fifty Years, and (3) The News in the Past Fifty Years, as a commemoration. It was printed in February of the twelfth year, a large octavo book of more than four hundred pages, a finely bound volume, covering major events at home and abroad, trends of the times, academic inventions, and so on, with comprehensive and precise analysis and explanations.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Shih's "World Philosophy in the Past Fifty Years" and "Chinese Literature in the Past Fifty Years" had already been published in the "The Most Recent Fifty Years" commemorative publication. In March of the thirteenth year, they were printed separately as single-volume editions and still distributed by this newspaper.</p>
<h3>"Education and Life" Weekly</h3>
<p>On October 15 of the twelfth year, this newspaper published a weekly called "Education and Life." The content of this weekly included essays, academic discussions, education news, investigation reports, introductions and criticisms of new publications, and lecture records. In addition, it also had two special columns, "Sports" and "Friends of Youth," and was published every Monday. The data room of this newspaper currently still has a bound volume of the first to fiftieth issues of this weekly, which was published until September 29 of the thirteenth year.</p>
<h3>Pictorial Weekly</h3>
<p>In the early years of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty, this newspaper had already used lithography to publish pictorials. "Yinghuan Pictorial" and "Dianshizhai Pictorial" were published successively as single-volume editions. However, the shadow-copied version and the regularly published "Pictorial Weekly" were first created on May 18 of the nineteenth year. Mr. Ge Gongzhen was in charge of the editorial affairs, carefully selecting current affairs photos and artistic photos from home and abroad, one sheet in folio, divided into four pages, published every Sunday, and attached to the newspaper without additional charge.</p>
<p>In the twenty-first year, the "January 28th" Incident occurred. This newspaper reduced its size, and the Pictorial Weekly was published until the eighty-sixth issue, and then temporarily suspended. On March 15 of the twenty-third year, the Pictorial Special Edition was changed to be published twice a week. From the 183rd issue, it was restored to one close-up edition per week. After the outbreak of the full-scale War of Resistance against Japan in the twenty-sixth year, it was suspended again. (Continued on page 21)</p>

<h3>On the Isolated Island of the Press</h3>
<p>"A brush sweeps across a thousand soldiers," was originally just a saying. However, during these eight years of the War of Resistance, news reporters, relying on a worn-out brush, exposed the enemy's conspiracies, ignited public sentiment, and launched a spiritual attack on the enemy, much like a paper bullet, sharply and forcefully shooting at the enemy. Newspapers, which usually promoted culture, generated the power of struggle during the war, becoming a type of weapon besides artillery fire. At that time, a news reporter's brush truly equated to a brave general resisting three armies.</p>
<p>In the cultural battlefield, there were also several different strategic approaches. Newspapers in the Great Rear Area were like a defensive army, while newspapers in the occupied areas were like guerrilla warriors. Shen Bao, adopting the stance of soldiers on the front lines, engaged with the enemy on the isolated island for more than three years. This was the most arduous stage in Shen Bao's history, spending its days amidst the enemy's conspiracies and schemes. It wasn't until the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor incident on December 8, 1941, when the isolated island sank and Shen Bao was seized by the enemy, that this magnificent and tragic historical drama came to an end.</p>
<p>The July 7th Incident, the August 13th Incident - the enemy's artillery fire moved from north to south, and many newspapers were destroyed one after another. Although Shanghai had concessions, it became an isolated island after the National Revolutionary Army retreated westward. Recognizing the severe environment in Shanghai, Shen Bao ceased publication. Later, realizing that Shanghai was a very important stronghold in cultural strategy, it resumed publication in Shanghai on the Double Tenth Festival of 1938. From then on, Shen Bao began its life as a soldier.</p>
<p>After Shanghai became an isolated island, it outwardly maintained the international organizational form of the concessions, but the enemy's potential forces gradually infiltrated. Many newspapers, under the guise of foreign merchants, promoted the awareness of resistance against Japan, avoiding interference from the enemy. When Shen Bao resumed publication, it also put up the sign of an American business, meeting its readers again under the name of the Columbia Company.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao's resumption statement on October 10, 1938, elaborated on the significance of Shen Bao resuming publication in Shanghai. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, Shen Bao "called for justice and humanity." When the National Revolutionary Army retreated westward and Shanghai became an isolated island, Shen Bao announced its suspension of publication "to preserve the last breath of freedom." However, with the continuous warfare and the distant prospect of victory, Shen Bao "did not want to remain silent for long," and thus established this new organization under an American company. The guiding principles for future commentary were: (1) To continue adhering to righteousness as its foundation, serving as the voice of the Chinese people, and fighting against the difficult environment. (2) To base itself on the principles of the Three People's Principles, inspire the self-confidence of the Chinese nation, promote unity, and cultivate courage. (3) To foster friendly relations between China and the United States. (4) To work together for world peace.</p>
<p>The guiding principles initially outlined were as described above. After resuming publication, Shen Bao proceeded based on these goals. Its commentary attitude promoted the established national policies, strengthened the belief in resisting Japan and building the nation, fully exposed the enemy's conspiracies, criticized Wang Jingwei's collaboration, and thoroughly and sternly condemned the atrocities of slaughtering compatriots. Internationally, it pointed out the enemy's ambition to challenge the world. It encouraged the relocation of compatriots and capital to the interior, and indicated the path that young people should take. Everything centered on the task of elucidating principles, supporting the leader, and coordinating with the national policies for resisting Japan and building the nation. This kind of commentary was greatly feared by the enemy, and the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department also paid special attention to it.</p>
<p>In terms of news, it tried to publish as much material related to the War of Resistance as possible, such as the central government's decisions, the Generalissimo's instructions, and especially proclamations issued on commemorative days, always finding ways to disclose them. After 1940, the enemy's oppression intensified daily, and it was very difficult to publish the full text. Therefore, it was rewritten into a news format and placed in the most prominent positions. Many news items about the War of Resistance and the Great Rear Area were not just published and forgotten. The proposed headlines had to grasp a central theme so that readers would be interested upon seeing them. In terms of content, it also strived to be consistent with the facts. What was most difficult to clarify was the situation of the enemy's and our forces facing each other, so maps were drawn at any time to complement the news, indicating the correct location for readers, even for a small village or a small river.</p>
<p>In addition, many feature articles were published, reporting the life impressions of the Great Rear Area to the readers in Shanghai, making them yearn for it. This material was mostly selected from newspapers in Chongqing, Kunming, Guilin, Hong Kong, etc., either directly reprinted or carefully rewritten. If foreign magazines had such articles, like the record of the American Life magazine publisher Roy E. Larsen's visit to Chongqing, or the report of the American writer Ernest Hemingway's visit to the wartime capital, they would be translated and published in the newspaper. If there were suitable photos, they would also be published as much as possible. This kind of special report greatly aroused the interest of the broad readership.</p>
<p>Regarding international issues, a large number of magazines and publications were ordered from the United States to systematically select articles, exposing the Nazi atrocities of invading Europe, accompanied by photos, under the name "Silent War Records." Among them, the arrogance of the Supreme Commander entering Paris, and the tragedy of the French military representatives negotiating on the train, were filled with indignation and made people vigilant. This work continued for a year and a half.</p>
<p>There was also the "Thief's Column." "Loose Talk" and "Spring and Autumn" also did a lot of work under the entire editorial policy. They published short and concise texts, exposing the crimes of the enemy and traitors, and did everything possible to satirize and rebuke them. For example, on the Double Tenth Festival of 1941, a special issue was published, and the writers were all well-known figures (but all used pseudonyms). Each article contained profound meaning and unlimited expectations. The article "Face Reality" was written based on the Generalissimo's exhortation to the compatriots across the country to "face reality."</p>
<p>In short, Shen Bao made every effort to seize opportunities to promote the awareness of the War of Resistance. Any related news and usable materials were never easily abandoned once grasped. In a situation of uncertainty and shock, this was very easy to incur disaster. Initially, the Shanghai Municipal Council set up a news censorship mechanism, but at that time, the enemy still feared the power of the British and Americans and did not dare to make excessive demands, so it was not very strict. As the situation shifted, the enemy's power in the concessions gradually expanded, and their attitude became tougher day by day. When the traitor arrived in Shanghai, dressed up like an ape, preparing to take the stage, the pressure on the press gradually increased. The "Special Operations Headquarters" at 76 Jessfield Road was established, and gangsters openly shot and arrested people in the concessions. In addition to anti-Japanese elements, anyone with a slight reputation and status in society who was unwilling to collude with them was their target. A dark and terrifying situation was created in the concessions, and news reporters felt threatened.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1940, everyone was talking about a blacklist of eighty-three anti-Japanese elements, and more than ten of them were employees of Shen Bao. At first, it was thought to be a threat, but as the rumors gradually intensified, people who were "wanted" began to be sniped at, and everyone became panicked. The entrance of the newspaper office was heavily guarded, and staff members also moved into the office to live, to avoid danger when traveling back and forth.</p>
<p>From July 1940, until the Pearl Harbor incident in December 1941, this year and a half was constantly filled with tension and terror. According to various investigations, the puppet "Special Operations Headquarters" first wanted to deal with Shen Bao, because if Shen Bao were to yield, other newspapers would be easier to manage. Shen Bao, standing in this position of being the first to bear the brunt, began to encounter the enemy's conspiracies and schemes. Seeing that the "wanted" people lived in seclusion and that the newspaper office's gate was so heavily guarded, making it impossible to start for a while, the puppets came up with another insidious plan. On April 5, 1940, Mr. Wang Yaoqin of Shen Bao was kidnapped from his home by several unruly thugs. They used threats to make Mr. Wang call the "wanted" people, inviting them to a secret place to eat, so that they could be rounded up in one fell swoop. Mr. Wang resolutely refused, saying, "I have lived to be over sixty years old, which is enough. If I die for justice, it would be a glorious sacrifice..."</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Huang Yanqing was arrested in another place, but they could not get a word out of him. Not long after, they attempted to kidnap Mr. Lu Yiming, but Mr. Lu learned of it beforehand and avoided it. So, they adopted the method of taking hostages, dragging away Mr. Lu's seventy-year-old mother and ten-year-old child, his whole family. But still, there were no results, and the traitors wasted their efforts.</p>
<p>When the enemy's conspiracy failed, another one was hatched. They adopted the method of stabbing people in the back, throwing hand grenades and setting time bombs, making it impossible to defend against. In the early morning of July 16, 1940, thugs threw a hand grenade from the newspaper's window, and for a time, smoke filled the air, and shrapnel flew in all directions. Five employees, including Shi Zhenghong and Wang Anlu, were injured, and Wang Anlu died soon after due to his serious injuries. When the thugs threw the grenade at the window, they threw two more grenades outside the door, and as many as fourteen innocent passers-by were injured by shrapnel. This was the first time Shen Bao was attacked by traitors.</p>
<p>After this incident, not only were those on the blacklist in danger, but other employees also felt uneasy. However, motivated by justice, everyone was not afraid of the enemy's threats and continued to fight. The newspaper office strengthened its defenses and remained calm as usual. Not long after the first bombing, the second one occurred. On a late autumn evening, the puppet "Special Operations" threw a total of three bombs, but not only did they not hurt anyone, but they also captured a thug. After interrogation, it was confirmed that he was instructed by Number 76.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1941, because of the matter of the puppet "Central Reserve Bank," bombs were thrown twice in succession. On the eve of the opening of the puppet "Central Reserve Bank" on December 30, 1940, Shen Bao published a record of a symposium on the "Sino-Japanese Currency War," exposing the enemy's financial conspiracy and the plight of counterfeit currency, which greatly angered the traitors. On the afternoon of January 4, three hand grenades were found on the sidewalk in front of Shen Bao, but fortunately, they did not explode. Later, the puppet "Central Reserve Bank" sent a large advertisement for the opening, requesting that it be published on the opening day, but the newspaper office refused. On the evening of January 6, there was a fourth bombing. The thugs threw a total of three bombs, but only one exploded, injuring four passers-by.</p>
<p>In addition, there were two other times when the traitors secretly brought bombs in. Once, it was placed in the bookcase of the editorial department, and once, in the bookshelf of the library, hollowing out four or five Western-style books and placing a time bomb inside. Fortunately, the bombs were not sophisticated and had already lost their timing, otherwise, the explosion would have been even more dangerous. This happened between the summer and autumn of 1940.</p>
<p>In such a turbid and miasmic environment, and in a time of darkness and storm, the lives of news reporters were truly in imminent danger. Mr. Jin Huating, a reporter for Shen Bao, sacrificed himself under these circumstances. At four o'clock in the morning on February 2, 1941, Mr. Jin passed by the Dahua Ballroom on Avenue Edward VII and planned to hire a car to return to the newspaper office. Coincidentally, all the cars of the car rental company had gone out on business, so he had to wait there. Unexpectedly, the thugs had been lurking around him and immediately surrounded and attacked him. Because of the harsh environment and the need to go out for work, Mr. Jin had also prepared a pistol to prevent accidents. But at that time, he was caught off guard and did not take out the pistol, and the thugs fired several shots in succession. Mr. Jin was shot four times and died.</p>
<p>After investigation, the reason for Mr. Jin's death was the advertisement for the puppet "Central Reserve Bank." When the second advertisement for the puppet "Central Reserve Bank" came, Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao discussed ways to refuse it. Mr. Jin expressed his indignation at the side and analyzed in detail the reasons why it must be rejected. The newspaper office authorities listened to his reasons and resolutely returned it. This matter was discovered by the intelligence officers of the puppet "Special Operations," who placed all the responsibility for refusing to publish on Mr. Jin, and finally, he was martyred under the clutches of the traitors, martyred for the country. This spirit of sacrificing oneself for righteousness is admirable, and his heroic name will forever remain in the annals of history. I remember that a week before Mr. Jin's death, he said in a casual conversation with his colleagues, "My children are young, what will they do if something unexpected happens to me?" It is clear how distressed he was inside. And this sentence became his premonition.</p>
<p>During this period, there was also a work that is worth mentioning, that is, the development of the student aid movement. The student aid movement was originally unrelated to newspapers. But the newspaper office itself is a social enterprise, which should serve the public. In the past, Shen Bao ran many cultural enterprises, which had many effects. At that time, in that dark Shanghai, this type of work was even more needed.</p>
<p>The beginning of this work can be said to be very accidental. In the summer of 1940, a poor child owed tuition fees, and by the end of the semester, he was still unable to repay them, so the principal sued him in court. After the news was published, many enthusiastic people voluntarily sent money to the newspaper office, requesting that it be handed over to the student. On the first day, more than a thousand yuan was received. In three days, the donations received could be used to support the child until he graduated from middle school. So, his parents were notified, and they were asked to bring the child and his report card to the newspaper office to talk. The results were indeed good. The money was handed over to him, and the receipt was made into a plate and published in the newspaper the next day. This connection led the colleagues of the newspaper office to organize a student aid movement.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1941, the "Shen Bao Reader Student Aid" was started. All the staff of the newspaper office took on various tasks, and a committee was established to preside over this matter. After the student aid movement was launched, it won the sympathy of society, and donations poured in. Most of the donations were money earned by ordinary citizens with their blood and sweat, saved by economizing on food and clothing, which was even more precious.</p>
<p>The newspaper office handled this donation based on the two principles of "purity" and "simplicity." It paid special attention to the family situation, academic performance, and conduct of the applicants, which can be said to be the main basis for the review.</p>
<p>Since the student aid movement was launched in the summer of 1941, many poor students were helped that summer vacation. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the newspaper was controlled by the enemy and could no longer fully exercise its power to promote national policies. So, it put more energy into the student aid movement. From the summer of 1941 to 1945, lasting four and a half years, Shen Bao received a total of about 40 million yuan in donations. More than 20,000 students of all levels, from elementary to high school, were helped. This great act of righteousness was completed by the joint efforts of the newspaper office and the readers. It demonstrated the power of human mutual assistance and promoted the noble spirit of service.</p>
<h3>Record of Ernest Major</h3>
<p>Ernest Major was the founder of Shen Bao. In 1871, he and his friends Woodhead, Prlay, Wachello, and Hoffer joined together to run a Chinese newspaper, each contributing 400 taels of silver, for a total of 1600 taels. On May 19th of that year, a partnership contract was signed, which is the first important document in the history of Shen Bao. Although there were four elders, Major was the key figure among them. The idea of running Shen Bao was also his original idea, and after it was opened, he also served as the first host.</p>
<p>Major's name was Annerst Major. In the early years of Tongzhi, he and his brother Friedrich came to China to do business, selling foreign cloth and tea. He slowly learned the Chinese language and writing, and became more familiar with the Chinese situation. One year, he suffered a loss in business and was very discouraged with his original profession, and he had the intention of changing careers. At this time, the sales of Shanghai Xinbao were very good. Major's comprador Chen Xinsheng suggested running a newspaper, and Major also expressed his agreement. So, he consulted with his friends and hired Qian Xinbo to go to Hong Kong to investigate the newspaper industry as a reference. Therefore, when this newspaper was first published, it imitated Hong Kong newspapers. In the inaugural issue, there was the following passage: "The making of newspapers originated from Westerners and was introduced to China. Having seen the Chinese-character news in Hong Kong, the style is very good. Now, imitating its meaning, Shen Bao is established in Shanghai." Major was a very fair and enlightened person. Although he was British, the opinions of Shen Bao were not biased towards Britain. He said, "This newspaper is for Chinese people to read, and the writing should be from the Chinese perspective." He very much wanted to make China move towards modernization, and sometimes he himself wrote editorials, vigorously advocating it. He was indeed a good friend of China, but unfortunately, the atmosphere at that time was narrow-minded, and his ideas were too high-minded and unpopular, and did not attract attention in society.</p>
<p>Major hosted Shen Bao, and the business was booming. So, he also started the Dianshizhai Printing Bureau and the Jiangsu Water Works, and the business became more and more prosperous. His brother's tea business also turned around, and there were profits every year. At that time, there were not many foreigners in Shanghai, and the two brothers were very respected by the foreign businessmen. Ernest Major was once elected as a director of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>In 1889, the Major brothers suddenly had thoughts of home and prepared to return to their country. So, they reorganized their businesses into the Major Brothers Company, including the Jiangsu Water Works, the Suichang Match Bureau, the Shenchang Bookstore, and this newspaper office. The total capital of 300,000 taels was divided into 6,000 shares. The Major brothers recovered their original capital, converted into 2,000 shares, and sailed back home.</p>
<p>Major's wife was the daughter of a bar owner, slim and beautiful, the most beautiful of the Western women. In British customs, family background was still valued, and it was thought that those who ran bars would not be upper-class figures. Only Major was infatuated with his daughter. At that time, many friends advised him, and many people ridiculed him, but he ignored them all.</p>
<p>Outside Nicheng, there was a club organized by Westerners, called the "International Association." The qualifications for membership were very strict, and the members were all well-known figures. Major was also one of the members. Later, because he was in love with the daughter of the bar owner, his membership was revoked. But Major did not mind at all, and continued to run his business. Every day after work, he returned home to enjoy his tenderness and beauty, and declined all external banquets and social events. After more than three years, the business developed day by day. The foreign businessmen originally had great faith in Major, and although they did not associate with him for three years, they respected him even more than before. Three years later, the International Association re-invited Major to join, but he only laughed it off.</p>
<p>In 1908, Major died of illness in England at the age of seventy. This newspaper office received the telegram on March 28th of that year and deeply mourned the old labor of this founder. So, on the newspaper of March 29th, a short biography of Major was published.</p>
<h3>Review of Publishing Undertakings of This Newspaper (Continued from Page 19)</h3>
<p>*Shen Bao Monthly*</p>
<p>"Shen Bao Monthly," which commenced publication on July 15th of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], although intended to commemorate the 60th anniversary of this newspaper, was the subject of great expectations. The inaugural editorial of the monthly stated: "It is our sincere wish that this publication become a public forum for the academic and literary world, and a free liaison for the works of various scholars and the general readership."</p>
<p>The journal's aims and content focused on elucidating the international situation, discussing domestic current affairs, introducing academic thought, and promoting productive enterprises. Thanks to the efforts of the contributors, it received praise from all sectors after publication.</p>
<p>Due to a change in editorial policy, it was decided to switch to a weekly publication, and thus the 12th issue of the 4th volume of "Shen Bao Monthly," published on December 15th of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935], was its final issue.</p>
<p>*Shen Bao Yearbook*</p>
<p>"Once statistical science flourishes, and the art of statistics advances, the evolution of humanity and the traces of social change can be seen in their true colors through numerical tables. As the Western saying goes, 'Figures don't lie.' The sufficiency of statistics far surpasses written records. To compile various statistics for reference is the function of a yearbook. Therefore, in addition to the daily newspaper and monthly magazine, this office also has the yearbook to follow."</p>
<p>The above passage is excerpted from a few sentences in the preface to the first volume of "Shen Bao Yearbook," published in December of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], titled "The Purpose of Publishing the Yearbook." A total of four volumes of the yearbook were published, ceasing after the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936].</p>
<p>*Shen Bao Weekly*</p>
<p>"Shen Bao Weekly," which focuses on the explanation and recording of current affairs issues of the week, was launched on New Year's Day of the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936], succeeding the "Shen Bao Monthly," which had been decided to cease publication. This weekly was published every Sunday and distributed with the newspaper, resulting in more widespread circulation. It continued until the outbreak of the full-scale War of Resistance, when the weekly was also forced to cease publication.</p>
<p>*Shen Bao Monthly's Auxiliary Publications*</p>
<p>The publishing house of *Shen Bao Monthly* edited and published a total of eleven auxiliary books. The first was "Memoirs of the Battle of Shanghai" by General Weng Zhaoyuan, listed in November of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], which went through three editions. The second was "Studies of the Soviet Union," followed by: "Studies of the Abundance of People and Beauty," "Selected Creative Novels, First Collection," "General Situation of the Chinese Economy," "Inspection Records of Gan, Wan, Xiang, and E Provinces," "Selected Creative Novels, Second Collection," "Lectures on the Current State of the Chinese Economy," "Conversations on India," "Selected Essays," and "Records of What I Have Heard at Chunlu," etc.</p>
<p>*Shen Bao Auxiliary Books*</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Auxiliary Books were edited by the "Shanghai Library" and published by this newspaper, starting in June of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933]. A large portion of them concerned the domestic and international situations, with the most about Japan and the Soviet Union, including: "Japan's Wartime Economy," "The Japanese Army," "The Japanese Navy," "Japanese Aviation," "Japan's Military Industry," "On the Current Situation in Japan," "On Contemporary Japanese Figures," "The Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan," "The Lives of Soviet Women," "The Soviet Union's Agricultural Five-Year Plan," "Education in the Soviet Union," "On the Current Situation in the Soviet Union," "Outline of Russian History," "A Brief Explanation of the Soviet Constitution," "An Overview of the Soviet Economy," "Twelve Studies of the Soviet Union"; there were also those concerning war and armaments: "New Weapons (Part 1)," "Comparative Study of Armaments of the Great Powers," "On War," "European and American Aviation," "Air Warfare," and "Armaments of the United States, Japan, and the Soviet Union," among others; the rest were: "Collected Advice to Shen Bao Readers," "Outline of Planned Economics," "On Modern Film," "Wireless Reader," "Young People," "America's Wartime Economic Plan," "World Economic Conference," "Inspection Records of the Northwest," "Collection of National Humiliation Speeches," "Where is Germany Going," "On the Greater Nanyang," etc., totaling as many as forty types.</p>
<p>Map Production</p>
<p>The suggestion for this newspaper to compile maps originated with Mr. Ding Wenjiang, and it was endorsed by the late General Manager of this newspaper, Mr. Shi Liangcai. Mr. Ding then invited his colleagues, Mr. Weng Wenhao and Mr. Zeng Shiying, to begin compiling in the winter of the 19th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1930]. In the process of compiling, they also prepared the plates, and by the winter of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933], the entire map was completed, with two types of maps printed:</p>
<p>(A) *New Map of the Republic of China* – Published on April 20th of the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934], a large octavo volume, exquisitely bound. The contents were divided into: General Map of Administrative Divisions, General Map of Topography, General Map of Transportation, Climate Maps, General Map of Cities, General Map of Languages, Mineral Resources Maps, Agricultural Production Maps, Various Ethnic Group Maps, Topographic Maps of Various Provinces, Maps of Important Cities, and a Table of Railway Distances. It also had five advantages: (1) It consulted both domestic and foreign documents and widely consulted world experts to newly determine latitude and longitude numbers. (2) It was based on various actual topographic maps from provincial survey bureaus, railway bureaus, water conservancy agencies, etc., referring to a total of seven or eight thousand maps before and after. (3) Terrain elevations were differentiated by layered coloring. (4) It referenced more than 1,500 maps made by foreign countries, correcting many errors in previous editions. (5) The entire map was drawn using two projection methods, polyconic and Albers equal-area conic projection. Place names were separately indexed by radical index, four-corner code index, and Roman phonetic index for easy reference.</p>
<p>(B) *New Provincial Maps of China* – Published on August 16th of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933]. This map was actually a prototype of the former, because the former was larger in size and more expensive, so it was negotiated with the original compilers, Mr. Ding, Mr. Weng, and Mr. Zeng, to reduce this map for use by schools, youth, and the general public.</p>
<p>Both of the above maps became excellent reference books and can be said to be one of the major contributions commemorating the 60th anniversary of this newspaper at that time.</p>
<p>Children's Reading Material</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of children's education to the nation, this newspaper also devoted itself to the publication of children's reading materials. Starting from Children's Day in April of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935], in addition to compiling and printing Children's Day commemorative albums every year, this newspaper also compiled and printed the children's weekly published in this newspaper into a separate volume called "Children's Friend," one volume per year, totaling three collections, until the full-scale War of Resistance broke out, when it was temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>In June of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], this newspaper published various popular reading materials for children, beautifully printed and richly illustrated, including "Five Righteous Men of Suzhou," "Wu Xun," "Su Wu Herding Sheep," "Jie Zitui," "Niu Lu," "Lin Xiangru and Lian Po," etc., all of which were works that cultivated personality and inspired integrity. In July of the same year, more volumes of popular science reading materials were published, specifically for children to read.</p>
<p>Other Publications</p>
<p>In addition, the number of miscellaneous books published by this newspaper over the years is also quite considerable. Their titles and years of publication are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>*Game Methods for Boy Scouts*, *Observations on a Trip to America* (both in the 8th year of the Republic [i.e., 1919]), *Reference Materials for the Pacific Conference*, *One Hundred Secrets of Success*, *Western Maxims*, *Records of the Far East Inspection of the American Congressional Delegation* (all in the 10th year of the Republic [i.e., 1921]), *Advertising and Life* (in the 14th year of the Republic [i.e., 1925]), *Selected Shen Bao Commentaries, First Collection* (Shen Bao's Student Essays Solicited for the 60th Anniversary), (both in the 21st year of the Republic [i.e., 1932]), *Wireless Research, First Collection*, *Commemorative Album of the Sixth National Games* (both in the 24th year of the Republic [i.e., 1935]), *Inspection Records of the Northwest, Volumes 1 and 2*, *Royal Fragrance Amidst Misty Clouds* (both in the 25th year of the Republic [i.e., 1936]), *True Records of the European War, Volumes 1 and 2* (in the 30th year of the Republic [i.e., 1941]), *Shen Bao Shanghai Citizen's Handbook* (in the 35th year of the Republic [i.e., 1946]).</p>
<p>*National Assembly Commemorative Booklet*. On November 15th of last year, the National Assembly grandly opened. This newspaper prepared for it several months in advance, compiling a type of National Assembly Commemorative Picture Album, which was published on February 1st of this year, colorful and magnificent, worthy of being a historical record of an epoch-making era.</p>

<h3>In the Past Seventy-Five Years: This Newspaper's Advertising, Distribution, and Other Matters</h3>
<p>I. Advertising</p>
<p>Advertising and newspapers now have an inseparable relationship; for any newspaper, advertising revenue must be the greatest element for sustaining its life. However, the history of general stores not hanging advertisements in front of their own doors but publishing them in newspapers is not very long. It goes without saying that the earliest Chinese newspaper—*Chinese Monthly Magazine*—did not have advertisements; even the publishers of the later newspapers did not think of using the position of the newspaper to publish notices as a source of income for the newspaper. Exactly when did the gentlemen at the newspaper suddenly think of soliciting advertisements? This question is not within the scope of this article. However, when *Shen Bao* was first published in Shanghai seventy-five years ago, advertisements had already been found in the newspaper.</p>
<p>The "Regulations of This Newspaper" in the first issue of *Shen Bao* contained the following "Advertising Publication Regulations":</p>
<p>"If there are advertisements for postings, cargo ships, brokerage prices, etc., wishing to be published in this newspaper, with fifty characters as the standard, those buying one day will be charged 250 copper coins; if there are more characters, 50 copper coins will be added for every 15 characters. Those buying two days will be charged 150 copper coins, with 30 copper coins added for every ten characters from the starting point. If there are those wishing to buy three or four days, the price is the same as the second day."</p>
<p>From these "Advertising Publication Regulations," it can be seen that, first, the advertising fee for "buying" one day and "buying" two days was different, and the difference was quite large. For the newspaper authorities, this was certainly a way to encourage customers to "buy" several days, in order to increase the newspaper's own income. Second, from these regulations, it can be seen that the advertising fee at that time was really very cheap. Because at that time, the general public was still quite unfamiliar with newspapers, and the matter of "buying" advertisements in newspapers was simply a bit "incomprehensible." Everyone was still not very clear about what effect publishing an advertisement in the newspaper would have on them, so the *Shen Bao* authorities specially lowered the advertising fee to encourage them.</p>
<p>However, the above advertising publication regulations were only limited to Chinese people; they did not apply to foreigners and foreign firms who came to "buy" advertisements. Perhaps the owners of the newspaper believed that it was no longer necessary to lower the advertising fee for foreigners with blue eyes to "use for encouragement," so the advertising publication regulations set for Westerners were quite harsh. The same fifty characters cost one silver dollar, with one cent added for each character, which was four times higher than the advertising fee for Chinese people, and it was necessary to "collect the publication fee in advance" and "limit it to one day." If they wanted to "buy" several more days, then "this newspaper is limited by space, and the price will be negotiated separately."</p>
<p>Here, we would like to mention the general form of advertisements at that time. There is no doubt that the arrangement method at that time was not at all elegant, and the people who published advertisements certainly had not read "Advertising Psychology" and knew nothing about the effect of stimulus-response! The stores simply drafted a manuscript, took it to the newspaper, and after the editor added a title (just like editing news), it was published in the next day's newspaper. The wording of the early advertisements was all the same. Apart from a title written as "Selling Foreign Soap" or "Selling Foreign Goods," the beginning of the main text was always "Notice: This store sells... a full range of supplies. Please visit No. X, XX Road for discussion. The price is exceptionally fair, with no deception of the old or young." At the end, a sentence was added: "Respectfully announcing this," and then "XX No., Month X, Day X, Notice" was added to complete it.</p>
<p>This kind of advertising format almost continued until after Emperor Guangxu ascended the throne. However, in these few years, the advertising business of the newspaper had made considerable progress: First, it was the expansion of quantity. When this newspaper was first published, because people in society did not understand the effectiveness of advertising, the advertisements published in the newspaper were only for a few foreign firms and a few businesses near the newspaper office. But by the twelfth year of Tongzhi [i.e., 1873], the amount of advertising had greatly increased. At that time, each issue of this newspaper had eight pages, and advertisements accounted for almost four pages at the back (at that time, the arrangement was news in the front and advertisements in the back). Therefore, in November of the twelfth year of Tongzhi, the font size of the advertisements was reduced by one size to accommodate more advertisements. Second, it was the enrichment of quality. In addition to stores promoting their businesses, announcements and advertisements for finding people also appeared in the newspaper. In addition, in the first year of Guangxu [i.e., 1875], theaters gradually opened and lotteries began, and these advertisements increased day by day. Third, it was the adjustment of prices. From the twelfth year of Tongzhi, the advertising publication regulations were set at a fee of five li per character for the first day and two and a half li per character for the second day, uniformly for both Chinese and Westerners, with no distinction between high and low.</p>
<p>In the thirty years that followed, apart from advertising clients improving the wording of advertisements and using different fonts and pictures to attract the attention of readers, there were few other changes. Starting from the thirteenth year of Guangxu [i.e., 1887], the advertising publication regulations changed the currency from cash coins to silver dollars, with each fifty characters costing 25 cents for the first day, 15 cents per day from the second to the seventh day, and 12.5 cents per day from the eighth day onwards. The position of advertisements was still at the end of the news. Clients who published advertisements not only did not "sit in numbered seats," but also did not have a distinction between "flower building," "building seats," "front hundred," or "back hundred," with everything being uniform, just like the audience going to see an early movie on Sunday.</p>
<p>The start of improvement was in the thirty-first year of Guangxu [i.e., 1905]. At this time, the social atmosphere was relatively open, and the newspaper business in Europe and America had already matured, affecting the Chinese newspaper industry. At the same time, the owners of *Shen Bao* also felt that such an advertising arrangement method was too unrefined, so they only then divided the advertising publication regulations into several types, such as "front page," "back page," "long line," and "short line," and the prices were also readjusted. This was a big step forward. As a result of the implementation, many people came to *Shen Bao* to publish advertisements, and it was almost impossible to accommodate them all. Starting from the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu [i.e., 1908], advertising fees were no longer calculated per character but per line, as they are now. At this time, the development of *Shen Bao* was very smooth, and advertising continued to increase. At the same time, due to the expansion of news coverage, it increased from one large sheet to two large sheets, and then increased to three large sheets, and this continued until the overthrow of the Qing court.</p>
<p>When the Republic was founded, everything was renewed, and this newspaper also engaged in renewing its content and expanding its layout. In terms of advertising, there were also great improvements. At that time, the front page advertisements (i.e., cover advertisements) often accounted for about two and a half pages, and there were also many back page advertisements. The *Shen Bao* authorities therefore opened up "middle seam advertisements," which were published in the "rectangular area" where the newspaper was folded in half, and the price was the same as the cover advertisements. This seems a bit "odd" now, but at that time, it was considered an innovation. Currently, general small-sized daily newspapers still use this type of "middle seam advertisement." At the same time, at the top of the commentary page, a "important notices" section was opened up. Although this position was not as good as the cover, it was also quite prominent, and the four large characters "important notices" naturally attracted more attention from readers. Many businesses published long-term advertisements in this position. The social economy at that time was not as chaotic as it is now. If it were now, then no business would publish long-term advertisements in the newspaper. From that time onwards, the distribution and advertising of this newspaper laid a solid foundation, and the business was booming, always leading the way. However, the purpose of the *Shen Bao* owners was not purely to make money. They paid great attention to social service, so this newspaper often allowed many poor people who wanted to publish an announcement to do so for free. There was a period when there were often people from the countryside who came to Shanghai and lost their beloved sons and daughters on the road, crying and pleading with the newspaper to help them find them. Out of consideration for humanity, this newspaper specially published free "finding child advertisements" in the "important notices" section, stipulating: "Anyone who is poor and comes to publish a 'finding child advertisement' will be exempted from fees; if there are illiterate people who cannot draft the advertisement themselves, this newspaper can also draft it for them."</p>
<p>Starting from September of the seventh year of the Republic [i.e., 1918], a narrow space was opened up along the top and bottom edges of each page to serve as a "special advertisement." For those published on the first, second, and third pages of the first sheet, each horizontal row cost 8 yuan per day at the top and 6 yuan per day at the bottom. The fourth page of the first sheet and the third page of the second sheet, etc., cost 3 yuan per day at the top and 2 yuan per day at the bottom. By this time, the grades of advertisements were invisibly divided into five grades:</p>
<p>Special Grade (Special Advertisement)</p>
<p>First Grade (Cover Long Line)</p>
<p>Second Grade (Middle Seam Long Line)</p>
<p>Third Grade (Ordinary Long Line)</p>
<p>Fourth Grade (Short Line)</p>
<p>This "special grade advertisement" was abolished in the eighth year of the Republic [i.e., 1919], and the fourth grade advertisement was also abolished in the ninth year of the Republic [i.e., 1920]. From April of the tenth year of the Republic [i.e., 1921], the advertising publication regulations were only calculated per line per day, abolishing the old rule that "the publication fee for the first day is more expensive, and the publication fee for the second day is cheaper."</p>
<p>In the past thirty years, the advertising business of this newspaper has been constantly developing. Due to the soaring cost of living, the adjustment of advertising publication regulations has also been repeated countless times (especially in the recent ten years). Regarding the improvements and developments in advertising, there are several points that can be specifically mentioned: First, what must be mentioned first is the publication of classified advertisements. Classified advertisements have been practiced in European and American newspapers for a long time, but Chinese daily newspapers before the tenth year of the Republic [i.e., 1921] had not yet thought of this. The advantages of classified advertisements do not need to be mentioned by me, everyone already knows. In hundreds of large and small advertisements, readers can quickly find the advertisements they need based on the classified sections, which is really the most economical and effective method. In view of this, this newspaper specially opened a classified advertisement column around the twelfth year of the Republic [i.e., 1923]. Later, when *Shen Bao* published the local supplement, classified advertisements were published on the supplement. At that time, classified advertisements were divided into the following categories: (1) Sales, (2) Purchases, (3) Announcements, (4) Rentals, (5) Renting Houses, (6) Hiring, (7) Seeking, (8) Seeking Employment, (9) Celebrations, (10) Real Estate, (11) Property, (12) Education, (13) Medicine, (14) Finding.</p>
<p>This type of classified advertisement, except for occasional slight changes in the subheadings, has never been interrupted until now.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is the expansion of the advertising space. From the tenth year of the Republic [i.e., 1921] to before the war, this newspaper often published three to six large sheets, plus the local supplement, the automobile supplement, the common sense supplement, and the weekly pictorial, etc., in which advertisements constantly accounted for about seven-tenths. Full-page advertisements were not uncommon, such as the Xth version of "Investiture of the Gods" performed on the Tianchan Stage, which also published full-page advertisements in *Shen Bao*. After the war, because the source of paper was not easy, the size could not be increased at will. The *Shen Bao* authorities adopted a principle of refined compilation, and the advertising space was naturally also limited. However, after decades of cultivation by pioneering colleagues, the advertising business of this newspaper had already established a century-old foundation.</p>

<h3>The Past Seventy-Five Years: The Newspaper's Advertising, Distribution, and Other Matters</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 22) 2. Distribution</p>
<p>When the newspaper was first established, the distribution process simply involved staff members distributing copies daily to various businesses, entrusting them to sell on consignment. In addition, the newspaper hired newspaper vendors to sell on the streets. At the time, the retail price was eight cash coins per copy, and ten coins per copy for distant sales. The extra two coins were considered the vendors' meal money. Wholesale to businesses from the newspaper office was priced at six coins per copy. Comparing these prices to current ones, the difference is truly vast. Roughly estimated, the newspaper's price has increased at least two hundred thousand times over the past seventy-five years.</p>
<p>At that time, the total circulation was only around six hundred copies. Distribution locations were mostly within the city, and there was no so-called "distribution network." By the end of the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi era, circulation had doubled, totaling one thousand two hundred copies. In May of the second year of the Guangxu era, it doubled again, becoming over two thousand copies. The following year, it doubled again, becoming five thousand copies. With the straight-line increase in circulation, the distribution range gradually expanded. Initially, the newspaper contacted local stores and letter agencies in the suburbs to distribute the newspaper. Then, it sought development in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas. According to the newspaper's records, by the sixth year of the Guangxu era, the newspaper was distributed in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Wuchang, Hankou, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Hong Kong, Anqing, Baoding, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Suzhou, Yangzhou, Ningbo, Yantai, and other places. Letter agencies in other areas uniformly sold the newspaper on consignment. Although the organization of the "distribution network" was not robust or tightly knit, it was indeed considered quite extensive.</p>
<p>At that time, the newspaper's distribution method, apart from sending special staff to various distribution points for sales in this area, relied entirely on letter agencies for areas outside of it. Because the newspaper had not yet established branch offices or distribution points in other areas, and the delivery methods were limited to postal delivery, it would take one or two days to receive the newspaper in places like Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In distant places like Hong Kong and Tianjin, the sent newspapers had already become old news, and the news value naturally greatly diminished. It was not until the twenty-third year of the Guangxu era that wholesale points were established in major cities to ensure that the readers could see the newspaper on the same day. Starting from the thirty-first year of the Guangxu era, the newspaper began to establish Shen Bao branch offices in various places. Many of the newspaper's current branch offices in various parts of the country were established at that time and have a history of forty years.</p>
<p>The first price adjustment occurred in the second year after the newspaper's founding, with an increase of two cash coins per copy, making the retail price ten coins, twelve coins for other areas, and eight coins for wholesale. For provinces without established wharves, the price was calculated annually, at four silver dollars per copy per year. The second adjustment occurred twenty-six years after the first price adjustment (the twenty-fifth year of the Guangxu era), with another increase of two coins. However, there was no increase for other areas, and the prices were uniform for local and out-of-town sales, but for newspapers sent to other areas, postage fees were added according to the distance. The third adjustment was in the eleventh and twelfth years of the Guangxu era when the cash price was changed to silver dollar price. The newspaper's price was changed to 1.4 cents per copy and 45 cents per month. The following year, the annual price for other areas was 5.4 silver dollars, 2.7 silver dollars for half a year, 8.4 silver dollars for Japan annually, and 10.8 silver dollars for European and American countries annually. It should be added that at that time, the Shen Bao was already sold in Japan, Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>After this, there were occasional price adjustments, which we need not list one by one. Fortunately, for the past hundred years, the prices of goods, including the newspaper cost, have only increased with each adjustment, up, up, and up. However, the increase in the price of the Shen Bao, apart from the increase in paper prices and the increase in postage fees, was largely due to the increase in the number of pages. The newspaper's page count increased from one large sheet to two large sheets, three large sheets, four large sheets, five large sheets, six large sheets... even ten large sheets, the price adjustment was of course inevitable.</p>
<p>Let's talk about sales. The first few years have been mentioned above. For clarity, let's look at the chart below.</p>
<p>(Year) (Sales Volume)</p>
<p>1872 600</p>
<p>1875 1,200</p>
<p>1876 2,000</p>
<p>1877 5,000</p>
<p>1912 7,000</p>
<p>1916 14,000</p>
<p>1917 20,000</p>
<p>1920 30,000</p>
<p>1921 45,000</p>
<p>1931 50,000</p>
<p>1925 100,000</p>
<p>1926 141,440</p>
<p>1936 150,000</p>
<p>In the ten years from 1926 to 1936, sales always hovered around 150,000 copies, so they are not included in the table. (Among them, in the first half of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), sales once exceeded 200,000 copies.)</p>
<p>Then came the war. The newspaper once moved to Hankou and Hong Kong to publish. In the 27th year, it returned to the "isolated island" to resume publication. During the three years of the isolated island period, due to the seriousness of the newspaper's speech, sales increased without end. Although sales in other areas were affected due to the war, the people in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang could still buy Shen Bao from Shanghai merchants every day.</p>
<p>If there is something to say, it's lengthy; if there is nothing to say, it's brief. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the newspaper resumed publication in Shanghai with glory. Thanks to its long history, solid foundation, the efforts of the host and all colleagues, it quickly restored its former appearance in a few months. At present, the number of publications is increasing day by day, and it seems to exceed the number of publications before the war, and the distribution network, from domestic areas far to Xikang, Xinjiang provinces, foreign countries far to New York, Chicago, Berlin, London, the newspaper has offices in all of these places, managing the distribution matters of this newspaper.</p>
<p>3. Supplements</p>
<p>The newspaper was initially a single large sheet. From the eighth year of the Guangxu era, a supplement dedicated to news from the capital city, called the "Beijing News Supplement" was added. This supplement was published for a long time, until the end of the Guangxu era. In the third year of the Xuantong era, due to "the daily progress of the world and the complexity of human affairs," a reform of editorial policy was announced, and the supplement "Free Talk" was launched at that time. Starting from January of the sixth year of the Republic of China, a column was opened on the fifth sheet, called "Old Shen Bao," carrying "a review of more than forty years," and extracting strange articles and stories, as well as political, customs, poetry, game articles, etc., published over the past forty years to readers and then discontinued.</p>
<p>The above is a rough introduction to the early supplements and columns of the newspaper. Looking at the nature and content of these supplements and columns with modern journalistic eyes, of course, we cannot give them too high an evaluation. The "Beijing News Supplement" simply copied imperial edicts, and the early "Free Talk" and other supplements also simply talked about romance, played with the arts and painting. Therefore, these supplements were added specifically for the general scholar-official class, and at that time, the Shen Bao was indeed a newspaper for the scholar-official class.</p>
<p>However, times are constantly advancing, and the essays of the scholar-officials are gradually being eliminated. Here, we will begin to describe from the eighth year of the Republic of China - at that time, it was the aftermath of the First World War, and the Chinese people were eager to understand the current situation of the new world and the relationship between the international community and China. Then, the vigorous May Fourth Movement took place, and the young people's demand for new knowledge became more and more enthusiastic. At the same time, the social undertakings in this city progressed very rapidly, and the number of local chronicles increased day by day. Due to these reasons, the newspaper added a variety of supplements and columns to meet the needs of readers in various aspects.</p>
<p>After this, it was also a period of rapid expansion of the content of Shen Bao. The important supplements are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Weekly Supplement: First published on August 31 of the eighth year of the Republic of China, a large sheet was published every Sunday and sent with the newspaper. The content was to publish systematic records of international current events and to translate and translate articles and important news from foreign newspapers and magazines to supplement the inadequacy of daily international news telegrams. Later, in the autumn of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, it was discontinued due to the occurrence of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang war and the contraction of the paper.</p>
<p>B. Common Sense Supplement: First published on June 1 of the ninth year of the Republic of China, with the purpose of introducing new knowledge of various subjects and cultivating healthy citizens, it was published daily. The content included common sense, economy, health, science, municipal administration, etiquette, miscellany, and other aspects. There was also an illustration every day, criticizing the dark forces and promoting the spirit of freedom. It stopped publication at the end of March of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>C. Automobile Supplement: First published on November 27 of the tenth year of the Republic of China, a large sheet was published every week and sent with the newspaper, publishing articles and news promoting the construction of highways and automobile knowledge.</p>
<p>D. Local Supplement: The Local Supplement was the creation of this newspaper. Zhang Zhuping, the former manager of this newspaper, explained the reasons for the creation of this event: "The purpose of this newspaper's creation and distribution of the Local Supplement is to facilitate the posting of advertisements by all sectors of the local business community, so it is limited to the local reason, one is because the content is limited to the local area (such as various details or the day's events, etc.), one is because the value of local advertisements is lighter, and the amount paid outside is twice that of the local area, I will use the two points of paying less postal tax and less paper consumption to directly give the local advertising users substantial benefits, the facts are obvious, and now the industry is following suit!"</p>
<p>The Local Supplement was first published on February 8 of the thirteenth year, and was published daily. In addition to publishing forecasts and records of various social activities in Shanghai and advertisements for theaters and shops, a column called "Art World" was opened daily from September of the 14th year.</p>
<p>E. Book Weekly: First published on May 18 of the 19th year of the Republic of China, sent with the newspaper. It was temporarily suspended when the Songhu War broke out in the 21st year. On March 15 of the 23rd year, it was renamed "Picture Special" and published twice a week. It was discontinued when the all-out War of Resistance began in the 26th year.</p>
<p>In addition, a "Commercial News" column was opened on October 31 of the 13th year of the Republic of China, and a "Education News" column was opened on December 8 of the same year, and a second supplement "Spring and Autumn" was opened in the 21st year. In addition, Shen Bao Monthly, Shen Bao Weekly, Shen Bao Yearbook, Shen Bao Industry Book... etc., were published one after another, forming the most brilliant page in the Chinese press. These are detailed in the article "Review of the Newspaper Publishing Business", and will not be repeated here. Later, in the 24th year of the Republic of China, "Science Weekly," "Popular Lectures," and "Medical Weekly" were published.</p>
<p>I don't want to write more about the situation after the war. Readers should be able to understand it. Let me add a little bit about the celebration supplements for commemorative festivals as the end of this section.</p>
<p>The first "National Day Special" was added on the Double Tenth Festival in the seventh year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The first "New Year's Day Special" was added on January 1 of the ninth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The first "Jesus Christ Special" was added on the eighth year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>4. Paper and Illustrations</p>
<p>The early newspaper used locally produced bamboo paper, which was thin and soft, easy to break. When reading the newspaper, you had to sit upright and be careful, and you would tear it if you were not careful. However, the words printed on it were clear and did not impair the reader's eyesight. At that time, it was printed inside, with eight pages per sheet, each page about nine and a half inches long and wide. From August of the 13th year of the Tongzhi era, the paper was slightly flared, divided into two rows, separated by lead lines, and it was only done for one month, and it was still changed to a long line.</p>
<p>From March of the 24th year of the Guangxu era, glossy paper was used, which was smooth and not easy to get wet. It was not until the Xuantong era that high-quality newsprint was used, and the layout was enlarged at the same time. From bamboo paper to glossy paper, and then from glossy paper to white paper, this is the progress of the newspaper paper.</p>
<p>Copperplate illustrations began to appear in the news in October of the seventh year of the Republic of China. The attached picture is a copperplate picture published in this newspaper, "Group Photo of All Students Sent Abroad by the Ministry of Education." However, at that time, inserting copperplates into the news could be said to be rare. If you compare it with the current "newspaper", it is of course not comparable.</p>
