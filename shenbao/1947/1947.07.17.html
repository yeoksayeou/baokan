<h3>首都準備國賓禮遇　魏德邁偕專家啓程　美使館宣稱廿日可抵京</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十五日電〕據官方今日宣稱：魏德邁將軍及其隨員一行，擬於十六日午後三時（格杯威治時間）乘陸軍軍用專機離此。渠等將首赴南京，本月二十二日即可到達。途中將經過舊金山，夏威夷，關鳥等地。魏氏一行，將首先於南京美大使館成立臨時行館，嗣後一切活動，將於考察時決定之。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十六日電〕美國大使館發言人今夜宣稱：魏德邁中將可望於二十日正午前後抵此，將駐節司徒雷登大使官邸。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕我政府已準備邀集專家澈硏目前國情，草擬具體可行援華辦法，提請魏氏携返華府，以供美方參考。外部與美使館連日接觸頻繁，作迎迓之預備。魏氏將一如威爾基，華萊士，受國賓禮遇於下機時，檢閱國府儀仗隊。美使館已在寗海路五號爲魏氏安頓行館，其偕行諸專家或將分住頤和路六號及國際聯歡社。魏氏將於其抵京之次日，晋謁蔣主席，並拜會張院長，王外長，然後稍留數日邀晤其欲與會談諸人士後，即出發赴各問題地區調查事實。</p>
<h3>中國早獲和平　有利中美商務</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十五日電〕我駐紐約總領事張平羣，今在紐約市扶輪社發表演說，要求美國友人改變其認爲中國乃一邊遠國家之傳統觀念。張氏稱，由於中美友誼之密切，及此次大戰中之合作，以及現代交通之發達，中國已成爲美國最近鄰國之一。「旁觀政策」，必不能成功，蓋友誼不僅爲責任，同時亦爲特權也。和平繁榮之中國，對美國必將有利，中國愈早獲和平及恢復秩序，則中國商務必愈形有利，吾人在建立一有秩序之世界，俾解決極權政策之威脅上，實有共同之利益關係。</p>
<p>〔中央社香港十五日電〕此問英文「南華西報」社評，論及魏德邁來華，預料中國卒將獲得美國援助。魏德邁可能祖任馬歇爾將軍所交卸之任務，而爲美國駐華特使。該報謂魏德邁之任務，在理論上爲實行馬歇爾計劃，重建受戰禍區域，同時並促進全世界經濟之穩定。該報相信魏德邁此行，必有良好結果。該報認爲歐亞兩洲，固有根本上歧異之處，惟馬歇爾計劃，外表上並非慈善性，而係建設性者，故馬歇爾計劃擴及亞洲時，中國自不能被除外。</p>
<h3>張嘉璈在津談話　東北恢復工作努力一年付流水　華北食糧問題甚嚴重亟謀解決</h3>
<p>〔本報天津十六日電〕張嘉璈十六日下午四時離津乘車赴平，定十九日返滬。東北之行尚未決定。據聞：張氏行前曾與杜市長商談津滬物資機構。張氏接見記者，首述東北情形，謂：自去年五月來一年之恢復工作，今復再遭破壞，所費人力物力，又付流水。日內即赴潘視察東北情形，硏究所需炎金，俾再謀恢復。關於政府停止貼補政策後與滅少發行之關係，張氏云：貼補所佔數字實際並不甚鉅。張氏此行主要爲解決華北食糧問題，對所需差額，已予具體研究。據云：平津糧源，不外平綏，平漢，北寗，津浦四途，目前僅餘平綏路尚可接濟，惟華北荒歉，故糧食恐慌，已不僅在於都市，並已及於農村，是以此一問題，乃益見迫切。解決之途，不外國內國外採購兩途，長江流域收穫甚佳，可望以一部接濟華北，惟所需雜糧，華南出產甚少，將向國外採購。關於行將恢復之中日貿易，張氏謂：日貨之出口，必以獲得美金或英鎊爲目的，而我國對進出口貿易，有適當管制，預料中日恢複貿易後，對我國市場，不致有何影響，對中中交農四行專業化問題：據謂，目前各項貨款，即係分類由中中交農各行分別貸放，而逐漸走向專業化。</p>
<h3>選總會議通過　有關選舉法規</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕選總十六日下午三時舉行第四次委會，張厲生主席，計討論並通過各案如次：（一）選所各級選所選委會通則，（二）立委選罷法第十三條，國大代表選罷法第八條內所列「現任官吏」是否包括中央官吏在內之解釋，（三）各省市選所人選葉經疑定名單，呈請國府核派。茲誌詳情如次：一選委會通則內容，規定每兩周委會一次，必要時舉行臨時會。選委會決定事項有：（一）選務進行，對所屬選舉單位之重要指示及委員人選之提請事項，（二）選舉上之對　事項，（三）關於各該選所經費預算等項。二·立委選罷法第十三條，國大代表選罷法第八條所稱之「現任官吏」如須競選時，均應受各該條之限制，但此項官吏是否包括中央官吏在內，又各省廳長主管業務不同，是否在全省均受上項限制，迭據各方面請予解釋，茲擬具釋明如下；（一）查立委選罷法第十三條規定之管轄區，係指行政區而言，立法意旨在防止地方官吏利用職權操縱選舉，則省府及所屬各機關應受限制之官吏，如欲在本省內參加立委競選，自應於法定期間內辭職。至中央各院部處會之官吏，職在推行中央政令，凡主權所及，皆爲其推行政令之範圍，從無區域劃分管轄之可言，且與地方選民並無直接之關係，自難有利用職權操縱選舉之可能，是除在任所所在地選區競選立委應早辭職外，當不受管轄區之限制。（二）準上釋明，各省之廳處，旣均以省爲管轄區，應即同受限制，並無業務之別。</p>

<h3>煉焦專家俞再麟　遭共匪殺害經過　董顯光在招待會中發表</h3>
<p>〔中央社錦州十六日電〕頃據北票煤礦失陷時自冠山礦廠逃至錦州之員工稱：冠山礦廠失陷時，該礦工務處長兪再麟，慘遭殺害，匪軍營長楊某事前明知兪係手無寸鐵之工程人員，竟亦慘下毒手，所發槍彈，洞穿頭部。兪氏中彈時，血肉橫飛，倒臥汚泥中。事後匪軍復嚴禁掩理，致暴屍四日夜，始由礦內同事潛爲掩埋。時値　雨連綿屍體冲露爲野夫所呑噬，僅存殘缺之頭顱及一手兩腿，屍骨狼篇，慘絕人寰。礦區收復後，兪氏殘骸已由礦運至錦州收埋停厝。至該礦被共匪擄去之人員，截至現在止，已查明者，有總務處長張慶春，業務處長謝九皋，職工處長丁耀中，秘書谷正端，工程師盧釗等二十餘人。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕董局長顯光，於十六日記者招待會席間，談共匪殺害煉焦專家俞再麟之經過情形謂：北票煤礦工務處長兪再麟君，爲我國煉焦專家，月初北票煤礦爲共匪攻陷，兪君因保護礦有設備，慘遭殺害，舉國上下，莫不悼悵，而痛恨共匪之殘酷，摧折人才，以遂其破壞建國之兇惡企岡。北票煤礦於卅五年一月蘇軍退出，經國軍收復後，由經部東北區特派員辦公處派員接收，整理復工，同年五月，又被共軍侵佔，北票煤礦所屬冠山。三寳二礦變電所被炸毀，南票礦廠嗣亦被毀甚鉅，卅五年十月，由資委會接辦，積極增產，日產達一千餘噸，卅六年預計產量爲全年五十萬噸，除運銷潘陽·錦州外，幷有一部由葫蘆島出口，運濟南靑島上海，惟該礦地處熟河邊隅，時受共軍竄擾，幾無寗日，該礦員工仍固守崗位，照常生產，本年六月中旬，共軍大舉侵犯該礦，廿八日台吉礦廠被陷，又續攻冠山礦廠，雖經該礦護礦隊及員工奮勇抵抗，卒以寡不敵衆，至七月一日完全淪陷。在礦全體員工，無一退出，兪君則英勇殉職。兪君浙江嵊縣人，年卅九歲，民國廿一年畢業國立北洋工學院，曾任經濟部礦冶研究所技正兼燃料研究室主任，卅一年由資委會派赴美國考察煤業，卅四年返國後，在經濟部戰時生產局任煤業顧問兼天府煤礦洗焦廠廠長，勝利後被派協同接收無順煤礦，卅六年元旦，參加北票煤礦，担任工務處處長，遺有妻孩五人，身後頗蕭條。</p>
<p>答記者問</p>
<p>〔又電〕董顯光在記者招待會中答復詢問如次：</p>
<p>問？過去由中央黨部所辦之中央社及各黨報，目前地位如何，將來地位擬如何決定，各該機構將隸屬何種部門，其經費來源如何？</p>
<p>答，目前各黨報均已組織公司，實行企業化，招收商股，由股東選舉董事，負經營之責，中央社亦正準備企業化。</p>
<p>問？能以目前實行戒嚴令之重要城市見告否？</p>
<p>答，目前上海戒嚴令尚未解除，戰區司有權於緊急時期宣布戒嚴令，然後報告中央。</p>
<p>問？人民對總動員之反應如何</p>
<p>答，政府戡平中共武裝叛亂之決心，頗受人民歡迎，此種情緒在政府自全國各地收到之電報中，在報紙記載中及公正民衆領袖與社會賢達所發表之言論中，均有充分反映，現一般人咸已認識，中共苟不遂其完全顚覆政府之陰謀，並强以其產生活型式付諸全國人民，決不休止。中共過去參加商談，僅爲拖延時間之一種陰謀，意欲加强其戰鬥力，攫取更多軍火與物資及佔領更多之戰略地點，此　成爲公開秘密，匪軍割據地域內，殊無秩序安全與正義之希望，亦爲盡人皆知，世界上任何政府，決不能與憑藉暴力而用陰謀殘酷手段，以遂行其凶惡政策之武裝叛徒。同時並存。</p>
<p>問？總動員實施辦法綱要何時公布？</p>
<p>答。總動員實施綱要，須俟國務會議通過，或將於本週末以前公布。</p>
<p>問？實行總動員後，肅淸共軍主力需要若干時間？</p>
<p>答，此爲一種猜測性質之問題，本人以爲剿滅共軍時間之久暫，將視動員實施之程度而定。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕據來滬之廣東某省委表示，廣東之治安情形，近已有進步，但南路仍不靖。海南島匪軍人數難於確定，但槍枝不過三千，苟有充分軍力，不難一鼓蕩平。又：香港之存在，對於粤省之不靖亦有密切關係，因中共份子常以香港爲大本營，以金錢收買失業軍官，策動破壞粤省之治安。同時某國之輪船，常以軍火拋於香港之領海內，由共黨設法撈起後，偸運入廣東，或將巨量藥材運至香港，易取現款，以爲策動之費用。在文化界及敎育部門，中共活動亦異常積極，有時一月所用之經費，達廣東省黨部宜傳費之八十倍以上。</p>

<h3>蘇工人在新疆開礦　伊犂民衆多人蘇籍　蘇領事拒絕發表人籍人數</h3>
<p>〔聯合社迪化十一日電〕（遲到）政府某要員今日向聯合社記者宣稱：蘇聯正在新疆邊區開採油產。蘇聯礦工並在伊犂一帶，阿爾提，固爾扎等地，加速開採鎢礦。最大產油地區爲迪化以東之烏蘇小城。此等油井係當親蘇軍閥盛世才執政時期開盤。一九四二年盛氏改變政策，逐出蘇聯礦工，但若輩事先已將油井記備拆除，並予塡塞，爲數約在十五至二十處間。伊犂叛黨反抗中央，准許蘇聯人重新進入油出，自由開採。伊犂民衆政治活動之廣泛，可于取得蘇聯國籍人數見之。依照精密估計，申請者平均十人中有七人獲准。據蘇聯當局解釋，申請者原屬蘇聯人民。此次不過恢復國籍而已。記者叩詢蘇聯總領事　弗里夫關於申請入籍人數之報告，渠勃然答稱：「發問理由何在？汝何敢問他國外交代表索取此種報告？若欲臺核蘇聯僑民人數，請問警察局」。薩氏之意，雅不願答復「政治」性質之問題，晤談遂猝然而止。</p>

<p>〔聯合社迪化九日電〕（遲到）數月以來，雙方爭奪新疆政權之恐怖份子，均從事煽動暴從，在街　襲擊對方之同情者。此閱各報刋載，光天化日日下，華人，喀薩克人及農吾兒人，在迪化通衢遭遇狙擊及受苛刑消息，盈篇累福。此穩人民並被迫承認所犯惡意政治活動等罪行。數星期中，此類事件至少發生十次，發生地點常在南郊一帶。政府要員今日告聯合社記者稱，主使者爲伊犂叛黨靑年團中之激烈份子。本週初英國領事館喀薩克族汽車夫亦遭毆擊，頭部車傷，瞞跚步入警　分局報告，時值領事外出，警官遂通知貼鄰美國領事派克斯頓領去。衝突起因於中國中央政府任命麥斯武德爲新疆主席，麥氏係一醫師，曾留學土耳其，常在國外，反對派認其不能代表新疆人民。除恐怖舉動外，此間並滿布政治諜報網，竊聽電話，蓋視政府方面軍政要員與外國領事之行動。</p>

<h3>美邀遠東委會各會員國　初步討論對日和約　定下月十九日在華府開會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕某外交權威稱：　國原擬於對德奧和約簽訂後方開始對日和約之談判，乃以歐局　結百出，和解無日，近乃有提前開始對日和約談判之可能。我方爲對日交　量多，作戰最久，理解最深之遠東主要國家，亟歷有卓員之區則　　　之主張　　·以舊此和約，謀遠東之澈底和平。關係當局則將就此一要　，加緊工作。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕國務院新聞處今日宣稱：美國現已　請　專家員會各會員國於八月十九日在華府召開十一國會議，討論對日和約事宜。此次會議係屬「初步」性質，而將致力於起草和約之「技術」方面。完成草約，無疑需時數月之久</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十六日電〕美國十六日提議：遠東委員會十一個國家，應於八月十九日在舊金山或華盛頓，召開對日和會之初步會議，該提案已矣交各國外長，包括蘇聯外長革洛托夫和內。在採取初步辦法加連對日和約之　結前，須先得　斯科之答覆。麥克阿瑟過去認爲對日和約應在一年祝十八個月內簽訂。至於對德條約談判，似將無限　　置，美國官員極希望提前對日締結條約。</p>
<p>美國之提案，主張先舉行專家初步會議，然後再舉行各國全體代表之正式會議。美建議舊金山為首選之會址，如有他國對此反對，則華盛頓爲次選之開會地點。</p>
<p>參加會議國家，應包括一九四五年十二月三强在莫斯科會議中獲致之協議下參加遠東委員會之各國在內。但此等國家並非以遠東委員會代表資格參加。此等國家爲中·美·英·蘇·（此四國在遠東委員會有否決權）。以及澳洲·紐西蘭·印度·菲律賓·荷蘭與法國。國務卿馬歇爾在預備會議中，擬將談判由其僚屬辦理。因馬氏將出席巴西京城之汎美會議，對此建議中會藏所定之日期，實無法分身參與。此一時間，又與澳洲所發起定於八月廿二日在坎伯拉舉行之央帝國會議開會日期相衝突。該會議目的在使英各自治領間對於日本和約談判建立統一陣綫。</p>
<p>美國官員對於澳洲之努力極爲關心，深恐英國之自治領國家，結成一集團，有一共同政策。對任何建議計劃，能以三分之二之多數，加以否決。惟預料日本和約不致發生甚多困難。日本之國界問題。業已由波茨坦宣言，加以規定，限於其本土之四島。對於雅爾達協定中，允其以千島列島及庫頁島南半部歸屬蘇聯一節，預料亦無人主張修改。至於阻碍對德問題獲致協議賠償問題，在對日問題中當不致發生何種重大困難。據麥帥之僚屬估計，中蘇及其他國家，已獲得之賠償，其數量約爲四百億美元，包括蘇聯自東北及朝鮮移去之日本財產在內。</p>
<h3>監委萬燦等提緊急建議　我國對日貿易停止考慮開放　並終止派遺商務團赴日</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕監委萬燦，于樹德，社光塤，李世軍，王冠吾等，十六日提出臨時緊急建議一件，請政府在目前情况下，停止考慮開放對日貿易，並終止派遣商務團赴日。此一緊急建議，曾經于院長核閱，並已正式提出。又聞于院長亦擬向國務會議建議，盼對中日經濟關係能作一通盤檢討，並專設機構，處理此事。據悉：萬燦等監委建議案中，對於負責處理對日貿易之機關，頗多不滿，認其僅注意於技術問題，對整個政策，未能作妥善計劃。萬等指出日本政府所擬就之一九四七年度中日貿易計劃，規定日本輸華物資九千九百十八萬美元，而我國運赴日本者僅四千七百六十八萬美元，我國入超逾五千萬美元，不合理孰甚。其次，日本所將運華者，大都爲脚踏車，手表，攝影機等不切實用物品，而我國運往者又將爲本國亦極缺乏之　，煤等物，此當難爲我國所接受。建議書中又指出日本音爲侵華國家，其未來意圖實堪重視，因之，在日本軍國主義未全根除，對日和約未簽訂，日本未履行其在國際所應盡之議務，遠東及世界和平未得確保，我國內部未全安定前，建議停止老慮開放對日質易，並終止派商務團赴日。</p>
<p>〔聯合社南京十六日電〕日本私人貿易將於八月十五日恢復，中國經濟專家深恐日本有再度實行「經濟侵略」之慮。目下中國方面殆無貨物可以輸往日本。反之，日本方面，自戰事結束以來，其工業並未受有損失，足以多種製成品向中國傾銷。而中國種往日本之鹽足以助長其化學工業，此項工業在中國則處於停頓狀態。又况麥師規定日本對外貿易須以美金計算，此無異爲一種「單程交通」。</p>

<h3>開放對日私人貿易　經部發言人談話　對申請手續等闡明原點</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十六日電〕經濟部發言人頃就開放對日私人貿易一事發表談話稱二國內工商界人士，於聞悉對日私人貿易開放消息後，均甚爲重視，預卜將來選派商務代表辦法決定後，申請前往者，必甚踴躍。經濟部對此事，正與各有關機關加緊籌辦，並曾召集會議，就進出口貿易名額分配赴日代表，申請資格及平續，代表資格審查現序等問題，作初步商討，法定後即正式公佈，惟在原則方面，有需說明以促起各方人士注意者：（一）此次開放對日私人貿易，非完全自由貿易性質，對輸出入之品類，申請赴日貿易之廠礦公司行號及其代表人選，仍須有相當之限制。即盟軍總部方面，對以上各點，亦甚爲注意，我政府不能不審愼處理。（二）此次派遣商務代表赴日，係屬，試辦性質，其名額雖暫定爲六十四人，然仍須視將來實際貿易情形，隨時有變更可能，故今後中日貿易發展，是否能礦實達到理想程度，尚有待於此次赴日人員之善爲利用機會，以努力爭取。（三）我國赴日商務代表，配定六十四人，其意義係在同一時期不得超出六十四人之請，而盟軍總部規定，每一赴日人員居留時期甚短，任務必須迅　完成，此次人員分批返　後，仍可輸流派遺其他人抵補其缺類，故申請赴日貿易人負，　雙其所營業務及資歷之經騐等項，合於派這條件，總能有邀請之希望。</p>
<h3>麥帥津貼日出口政策　美紡織業亦表示不滿</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約十五日電〕若干國際貿易商，今日就南京方面無擊麥克阿瑟欲自八月十五日起實行津貼日本出口之政策一事，向中央社記者稱：彼等僉信此項津貼，爲間接而非直接者，此項津貼，主要將應用於美國之對日棉花輸出。傳麥帥之政策，旨在使美國政府津貼美國之棉花出口商，俾保證其獲得公正價格，同時可保證日本黏織商獲得棉花供應，僉信自中國立塲言，此項津貼政策，或可使日本紡織業　倒中國之紡織業，然在美國視之。此事並非一定影　任何特殊國家者，蓋盟軍　部之政策，在促進日本與各國（尤其爲遠東各國）之多邊商務。然若干人士則　爲：美國爲恢復日本國際貿易而採取津貼政策。該有若干忽略之處，同時美國之紡織業人士，對津貼政策，亦表不滿。蓋日本之紡織業，或將打擊美國之紡織業也。美圓在　復日本私人貿易之幕後，實　于有减少其佔領費用之目標。一般認爲日本工業必須恢復至下列　度：即其出口之所獲，須能儘付其進口之所需，其舉或可限止美國金錢之　　流出。據稱：自去年一月以來，美國已在日本消費三十億美元，同時美國商人，認爲在恢復對日貿易之初期中，對美國商業之影響甚小，蓋恢復日貿易之第一步工作，係調查情况及決定能作何種貿易。</p>
<h3>加强九龍區緝私　擬具計劃及預算</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十六日電〕政府頃決對華南方面九龍區之緝私工作加强進行，其計劃預算業經十五日政務會議通過，要點爲：華南方面進出口走私過於猖獗，去年十二月間，雖由中央銀行貝前總戴赴港，與港政府洽商，會同擬訂合作緝私辦法之協定，並經前政院宋美長核准，由中央銀行撥給九龍關港幣三百萬元辦理，嗣以該項協定港政府迄未簽字，致上款無法照撥，茲以關於金融及緝私等問題，我政府正與港政府積極進行磋商中，惟無論能否商得協議，九龍區海關緝私工作實有迅謀加强之必要，海關稅務司已擬具計劃及預算：（一）陸路緝私：重修及添設支關，計需港幣四十六萬一千元。（二）海面巡緝：添設海面支關及躉船，計需港幣二百廿五萬五千元。（三）設置無綫電台，需港幣二十四萬一千元（四）調赴九龍服務關警旅費，約港幣九萬三千元。以上四項共計港幣三百萬元。</p>

<h3>鎮江郊外豔屍　七竊現瘀血似被人扼死　收殮已三日尚無人認領</h3>
<p>〔本報鎭江十六日電〕十三日晨七時，在鎭江南郊省句公路左側靶子塲附近，發現年約廿餘歲，燙髮，身着紅黑相間圓點洋紗短袖旗袍，足穿紫色有帶橡皮底單鞋，身傍遺有小型帆布袋，內藏藍色有條舊領帶一條，女用吊帶一付，國民戲院十二日已用戲票一張，沙利文麵包半個，橘子糖四只，法幣一萬一千七百元之被害女屍一具。經省參議會警衛隊長李正光電告警局，並報請地院於當日下午四時檢騐收理後，迄今三日，尚無屍屬認領。據承辦該案之警員談：該屍檢騐時，面色青紫浮腫，七竅均現瘀血，眼腫微垂，曈孔反張，帶有血絲，舌抵牙關，頸項前半部靑紫腫起，除手部現有紫班外，全身肌膚慘白，微現浮腫，腹部微隆。據檢騐者談，並非處女，肛門外有紫便少許，狀似生前被扼致死，依據女屍所遺戲票觀察，被害時間爲九時以後，惟兇乎究爲一人或數人？則因屍體發現時，曾有若干鄉農英販經過，屍傍足印雜沓，殊難推斷。惟被害三日，迄無親屬認領，恐係初由外埠來鎭爲人預謀殺害。該案發生後，省警局長傳　仁極爲注意，業手令刑警隊長夏象民加緊硏緝。今晨該局司法科長邵觀國，曾通知一分局長梁冠軍，另行備棺淺厝，以便屍屬認領，因十三日收屍時係以蘆蓆包殮，日久易致腐爛。惟今日因陰雨竟日，不及重殮，擬於明晨舉行，屆時有關機關幷擬拍照待查。</p>
<h3>社論　歐洲經濟會議閉幕</h3>
<p>美國務卿馬歇爾元帥在鹽湖城美國州長年會席上，再度發出援助歐洲的呼籲時候，基於「馬歇爾計劃」而召開的歐洲經濟合作會議，却正同時完成了歐洲復興計劃之第一階段。由於三强外長會議的不歡而散而召開的歐洲經濟合作會議，至此而圓滿閉幕。此一巴黎會議，雖稱爲歐洲經濟合作會議，但由於蘇聯的拒絕參加「馬歇爾計劃」，影饗了東歐若干國的態度，實質上僅包括了西歐各國，而且在西歐的佛朗哥西班牙還不算在內。土耳其和希臘，雖則地處東歐，却也參加了這一具有歷史意義的會議。據報載消息，巴黎會議的成就是在決定設置一個復興設計機構，立卽在巴黎舉行會議，並限於九月一日前完成全部報告，以便提交美國；又於此機構中設立一合作委員會，由十六國全體參加，卽目今抵制馬歇爾計劃之國家，此後亦可加入。此外，此一機構並設置一執行委員會及四技術委員會，分別處理糧食，電力，鋼鐵，及運輸問題。由此而觀，可知歐洲各國，除蘇聯及與蘇聯聯結在一起的各國外，正在如何密切合作來提出他們的復興計劃，以冀獲得美國的援助。而美國的朝野，鑒於晚近國際局勢的所趨，對於加緊援助各傳統友邦之呼籲，旣出諸像這樣負責的首長如杜魯門總統及馬歇爾國務卿之口，自必一致起而擁護，等到秋凉國會重開以後，「馬歇爾計劃」，必將更有具體事實的發展，似不待言。</p>
<p>歐洲當戰亂之後，各國所遭受到的損失極重，美國出而援助，原是應該歡迎的。可是蘇聯却以爲美國的援助有政治干涉之嫌，拒不麥加；若捷克，若波蘭，若羅馬尼亞，若匈牙利，一般人民甚至政府方面何嘗不也想參加馬歇爾計劃，以期獲得他們本國的經濟復興？祗因蘇聯的態度旣如此堅決，於是便不得不放棄本意，拒不參加此次在巴黎召開的歐洲經濟合作會議。這里捷克政府的態度，初則表示願意參加，繼則表示拒絕，尤令世人於元突之中　到同倘，馬歇爾針劃實是一種經濟計劃，就是以美國的經濟力量來協助歐洲的復興；拒絕了此一馬歇爾計劃以後，便不得不有足以替代馬歇爾計劃的計劃，使此等國家不致於失望太甚。這是爲此，所以我們聽見有所謂「莫洛托夫計劃」的提出，以與馬歇爾計劃相抗衡。</p>
<p>據倫敦傳來的消息，蘇聯爲對抗馬歇爾計劃，援助東歐各國的經濟復興，業已提出並實施「莫洛托夫計劃」。據稱東歐九國卽將加入此一計劃，卽蘇聯，波蘭，捷克，保加利亞，羅馬尼亞，匈牙利，芬蘭，巨哥斯拉夫，和亞爾巴尼亞，而且蘇聯占領的德國也可能加入此一計劃。此一計劃的核心，主要是在拒絕美國金元的援助，以免連同接受任何政治終款。加入英洛托夫計劃的各國厲行經濟的一元化，互通有無，並在一個共同的計劃下，從事於計劃生產，設置關稅同盟。爲實現此一計劃，蘇聯與波蘭，保加利亞，捷克，羅馬尼亞各國間，茲已簽訂各種有關經濟協定。據此，則蘇聯正在東歐各國遂行它的經濟政第。</p>
<p>我們希望此一草洛托夫計劃眞能有助於東歐各國的經濟復興：但觀於所謂一元化，所謂互通有無，所謂計劃生產，其結果恐未必能如一般人民的理想。「大東亞共榮圈」在世人，特別是遠東人民的創痕猶新，戰後一般人民的願望是能够免爲「圈圍」局勢的重演；但現在的國際局勢，無疑地，却又進入了「圈圍」局勢。對於這種馬歇爾計劃與英洛托夫計劃的對峙，雖則在現階段的國附形勢下或是不可避免的，但我們總希望如果有對峙局勢的話，對峙的相鬥性能够趨於輕微以至消滅。只有在消除了相鬥性的情形下，國際的持久和平　的確保之望。</p>
<p>現在的確是人類歷史上一個嚴重的關頭。目前的種種跡象，已使世界第二次大戰中所產生的「一個世界」的觀念趨於幻滅。「一個世界」將屬於兩個營壘，兩個「圈圍」。馬歇爾計劃之外，而另有所謂莫洛托夫計劃的提出，愈使「一個世界」的觀念破產。巴黎歐洲經濟合作會議的召開和閉幕，可以說結束了一個時代，使世界戰後的歷史又展開了新頁。此後的道路不一定是平坦的，我們衷誠願望列强的政治家能使人類免於未來的浩刦，能够衷誠合作，以確保世界的持久和平。</p>

<h3>美國軍事代表團　決協助希臘戡亂　馬歇爾國務卿率直表示</h3>
<p>希政府軍發動攻勢游擊隊被包圍</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山十六日廣播：馬歇爾國務卿今表示，美國駐希軍事代表團將指示希臘軍隊如何向游擊隊作戰。馬卿稱，美軍事代表團之主要目標，乃在確定政府軍需要何種配備，以便應付游擊隊。至於美方軍事代表是否將赴希臘西北部，馬響則未有表示。記者詢以美代表是否將指示希政府軍向游擊隊作戰，馬卿答，　以爲此種指示甚爲可能。</p>

<p>〔合衆社雅典十六日電〕希臘參謀總部發言人十六日稱：「四萬五千騖臘軍隊，業已將侵入之遊擊隊合圍，其中有大部分被困於喀爾巴然區，企圖逃回阿爾巴尼亞，詳情如何，尚有待於前綫之報告。同時據塔斯社地耶那十六日消息：官方之阿爾巴尼亞電訊社，否認需有國際兵團，自阿爾巴尼亞派赴希臘作戰。</p>

<h3>國際警務軍問題　蘇仍持異議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖十五日電〕安理會今日開會討論國際安全警察隊一事，美代表認爲蘇聯似不願且亦不能供獻其一份力量。各代表當即主張徵詢蘇聯對於安全警察隊人數及組織之意見，蘇聯始終持異議，致結果幷未獲得成議。先是英代表提議五强軍事參謀委會應同意於八月五日前，估定此項軍隊之實力，多數皆表擁護。澳大利亞與法國之建議較爲複雜，希望蘇聯表明意見。至此蘇代表莫洛米哥堅持在東西雙方分配五强之供獻力量未獲解決之前，不擬論及此項軍隊兵力間題。</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴黎十六日電〕草擬歐洲經濟復興計劇之歐洲經濟合作委員會，十六日在法國外交部召開第一次會議。</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎十五日電〕歐洲十六國業於今夜組成一集團，在六個星期之限期內，迅速草擬共同復興計劃之藍本，俾可藉美國之助，以避免本年冬季所將遭遇之經濟崩潰威脅。歐洲經濟會議討論歐洲經濟合作問題，歷時四日之後，業於今夜結束，各國重要代表均將於明日離此回國，惟巴黎已設立一新機構，由十六國代表所組成，負責草擬有史以來最遠大之國際計劃，限於九月一日前擬就，俾便提交美國硏究。</p>
<p>十六國代表所組成之集團，現已定名爲「歐洲經濟合作委員會」內設英國所主持之執行委員會，由法·義·荷蘭·挪成代表組成之·並另設糧食與農業，燃料及電力，鋼鐵及運輸四個技術小組委員會，各委會明日即行正式成立，其主要工作有如下述二端：（一）研究歐洲各重要工業國家之生產發展，俾可增加各國之力量，並促進歐洲各國間之貿易關係。（二）硏究各重要物品之需要情形，俾可要求外國接濟，尤其是西半球方風。此一報告書實際上將成績　年復興計劃之藍本，巴黎經濟會議現經小國之堅持，仍將門戶開放，留待蘇聯及其八個附屬園加入。</p>

<h3>調查資源頭緒紛繁</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎十六日電〕歐洲經濟合作會議之第一階段，業已獲得成功，然與會代表及觀察家均覺此賡續四日之會議，僅代表任務之開端，眞正之工作將於今日始行開始，而須賡續至數星期之久，始能告成。觀察家幾均相信在技術委員會中各代表不但將面臨彼　州行調查之經濟實况，且將面臨與經濟問　互相運　之政治問題。若德國問題即其明例。燃料及　鐵等小組委員會勢不得不考慮魯爾區工業在任何歐洲復興計劃中所視任之任務，此則又不得不牽涉巴黎會議將如何影響莫斯科外長會所設四强委員會之基本問題，該四强委員會之任務在硏究與統一德國經濟有關之　國經濟問題。再者，英美即將在華盛頓開始舉行之魯爾工業及德境英美區工業水準之談判，對於十六國合作委員會之工作亦將有直接之影響。糧食小組委員會之任務，亦不如想像之簡單，良以糧食問題必將牽涉向美匯區購買以及向美元區以外購買以資補充之可能性。</p>

<h3>蘇聯片面使用否決權　漢城會商陷絕境　勃朗指責蘇方違反協定</h3>
<p>〔路透社漢城十五日電〕美國駐韓主任專員勃朗少將今日稱，美蘇共同討論設立韓國臨時政府之第一問題，爲「一國是否得片面決定行使否決權，並拒絕其所反對之任何政黨或社團提出黨見」之問題。蘇聯代表團，今欲使用此項否決權。美國代表團嘗一再建議有計劃地審查聲請陳述意見之各韓國政黨及社團之名單，並考慮兩代表團所提出之反對意見，蘇聯竟一再予以拒絕。蘇代表團雖未向韓國之任何一黨提出特定之指責¥但曾武斷地指責各朝鮮政黨缺乏信任。美代表團當堅決主張完全責行本年初成立之馬歇爾—莫洛托夫協定，該協定規定各朝鮮民主政黨及社團，均應保證其全體得向美蘇混合委員會堤出意見。</p>
<p>〔新亞社漢城十六日電〕勃朗少將本日發表美蘇聯合委員會會議經過稱：「美蘇對參加聯委會之韓國政黨及社會團體之鑑別意見。相距甚遠。蘇方認爲政黨社團之數目應减少至最低限度，政黨與社團並應予以分別。已有中央組織之團體，則應取消其地方　構之參加權利，同時反對託治之團體及與莫斯科協定不適合之團體，亦在拒絕其參加會議之列。美方則主張在第五號及第十一號聲明中已署名之各政黨社團，均可作爲最初參加協議之團體，俟會議正式召開後尚不改變態度時，始予以開除，並認爲各政黨社團廣泛參加聯委會，與莫斯科協定之基本精神極爲吻合」云。</p>
<h3>美進出口管制　延長至明年二月</h3>
<p>中央社華盛頓十五日專電〕杜魯門總統今簽署新法案，規定稀有貨物包括煤油·錫　肪及油類等，其進出口管制應延長至明年二月。此法令使政府有權指定貨物之優先權，而國務院可藉發出簽證，對外輸出貨物，以推進美國之外交政策。出口管制將施於四百種貨物，脂肪油類肥料材料及食米之進口，亦將繼續管制。杜魯門總統相信，美國對外貿易之管制，在一九四八年三月一日取消後，仍需加以監督，唯渠之目的係消除對世界商務之干涉</p>
<h3>英鎊外匯　恢復爲國際通貨</h3>

<p>〔路透社倫敦十五日電〕下議院今日舉行印度獨立法案之三讀辯論，歷時三小時又三刻，並未需要表決。艾德禮苜相於結束辨論時，表示印人可以信賴英國之充分同情及援助，而無依附之危險。渠並表示希臘印度之分治，可以進化成聯邦制度，使印度之兩部旣能保持統一，亦能行使充分之權力。首相對下議院之迅速通過此案，表示謝意，並曰：英國政府切盼印度之新政府得以進行其任務。</p>
<p>反對黨之溫特登伯爵代表保守黨結束辯論，呼籲英印之間保持友誼。當辯論之初，商務大臣克里浦斯爵士聲明英國不認通過此一獨立法案，即已完成其任務。巴基斯坦及印度旣尚爲不列顚共和邦之一部，英國自尚有促進其進步與繁榮之責任。反對黨之白特勒，對於印度藩邦之未來地位，表示關切，希應英政府能以同情諒解之心情，處理任何藩邦之獨立要求。</p>

<h3>美國外交政策　朝野意見一致　杜魯門總統宣稱</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十六日電〕杜魯門總統今日宣稱，全國現對外交政策意見一致，並希望協助凡願合作追求共同復興目標之國家。總統此言適値巴黎舉行歐洲經濟會議，討論馬歇爾計劃，而國務卿馬歇爾又促請歐洲團結推行復興方案，且表示美國將予切實援助，此點殊堪軍視。同時，據衆院議長馬丁宣佈，即將設立特別調查乎委員會審查歐洲十六國之需要，另由總統所設三個委員會輔佐其事。</p>
<h3>日本共產黨內幕</h3>
<p>本報編譯室特譯</p>
<p>日本共產黨經常向「三菱廿一號」請示。「三菱廿一號」是建造在三菱洋行地產上的第廿一座房屋。現在，裏面住着蘇聯駐日代表團的高級幹部。</p>
<p>在出名的明治神社附近的東京明治街上，竪立着一座灰色的二層樓水泥建築物，門口懸着一塊招牌，上書「共產黨本部」字樣。這座「赤色的神社」，一邊毗連着一座木房子，裏面是共產黨報紙的不整潔的辦公室，一邊是一爿書店，裏面充塞着馬克思主義的書報。</p>
<p>在東京中部記者俱樂部附近，設立着一座五層樓紅色建築物，上面的門牌標着「三蔆廿一號」，是建造在三菱洋行地產上的第廿一座房屋。現在，裏面住着蘇聯駐日代表團二百十八人的高級幹部。</p>
<p>從共產黨本部到三菱廿一號之間接連着一條堅强的紅色綫索。日本共產黨經常向三菱廿一號請求指示與諮詢。蘇聯缺乏担任這一項工作的人員。代表國中祗有九個人能够說得一口流利的日本話，因此，住在日本的白俄老僑民被强迫着替蘇聯做事。命令傳到明治街後，就變做了行動。</p>
<p>被日本當局監禁的國內共產黨員於一九四五年十月被佔領軍當局釋放出來，後來，旅居中國的日本共產黨員也得到了回國的許可。這一切措置都根據波茨坦宣言，並遵照美國政府的命令，那時民主國家和蘇聯的戰時同盟的夕照還沒有完全消逝。</p>
<p>從那時起，日本共產黨漸變成蘇聯反對和阻撓美國對日政策的主要工具。</p>
<p>這一個對美挑戰的團體，它的組織完全承襲蘇聯的制度。先由黨員選出全國共產黨大會，再由大會選出中央委員二十人，組織中央委員會。他們便是共產黨的領袖，但是實權操在政治局。三位領袖支配着政治局，執行黨的決議，並決定日本共產主義的路綫。那三位領袖便是：</p>
<p>（一）德田球一—五十六歲，生於冲繩島，法律學校出身，曾任刑事律師。他是日本共產黨創辦人之一，曾於一九二二年，一九二六及二七年先後往莫斯科，被捕三次，自一九二八年監禁至一九四五年始由美佔領軍釋放，不久即被推舉爲共產黨秘書長，一九四六年當選國會議員。德田擅長演說，是一個激烈的反美份子，生張暴力革命，不信任羣衆，在蘇聯或將被目爲托洛茨基派，但因其忠於主義，個性堅强，監禁時期長久，卒被推爲共黨領袖。</p>
<p>（二）野坂鐵—五十五歲，經濟學家，日本共產黨現代派領袖，與德田相抗衡。少年時代即加入共產黨，一九三一年亡命蘇聯，與蘇聯關係較其他任何日本共產黨員爲深切，曾任第三國際執行委員，一九四三年赴延安，一九四六年一月返國。野坂頗爲日本知識份子推重，熟悉國外情形，與蘇聯亦有密切關係。</p>
<p>（三）志賀吉雄—四十六歲，介於德田與野坂兩派之間，與德田同時入獄，但與野坂較爲接近，善於演說及宣傳，可能爲日本共產黨中智力最强大的一個人。熟悉日本共產黨內情的人，都認志賀爲該黨中最危險的人物。（譯自一九四七年六月十六日Newsweek）</p>

<p>〔合衆社巴達維亞十六日電〕十六日在日惹舉行之印尼共和國閣議，討論范莫克聯合憲兵隊與停止戰事之建議，並無結果。今晚將再度召集閣議，由國會之執行委負會列席，可望獲得決定，夏利福亭總理，明日或將乘專機携決議赴巴達維亞。共和國高級官方已否認爪哇西部之外人財產被印尼軍拆毀之報告，渠稱各房屋均屬完好，少數萬隆附近荷蘭人之房屋，則因兩軍之衝突而受毀。共和國副總理加尼稱，渠不久將視察蘇門答臘戰綫，其他官員則將赴爪哇視察。按荷蘭現需要立即解決各綫停戰之問題。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴達維亞十六日電〕權威人士今日宣稱，印尼總理夏利福亭已與荷屬東印政府要員對於荷方所提印尼共和國未來憲兵部署問題折衷方案，成立臨時協定，先由印尼憲兵負責維持治安，但若地方局勢越出印尼所能控制範圍，則組織荷印聯合憲兵隊接收該項職務。此點乃荷印雙方談判設立印尼聯邦臨時政府最後一大難關，近曾陷入僵局，致有引起戰爭之虞。夏利福亭本人昨與荷印代理總督范莫克磅商時，表示贊同荷蘭折衷方案，惟尚待印尼內閣最後決定。夏利福亭今日業已飛返日惹。據中立派消息變通人士稱，一切　於日惹方面是否支持夏氏主張。</p>
<h3>美軍大批剩餘物資　將以廉價售與日本　其中七萬餘噸業已成交</h3>
<p>〔合衆社宮之下十六日電〕美第八軍供應官保傑斯對芳干訪問日本之報界發行人及編者稱：在美軍撤退時，美軍所有價値數億元之配備，將售於日本政府或私人。武器及其他純粹軍用品則將加以毀壞，若干軍用品業經毀壞。渠又述及第八軍處理之日本軍事供應品稱：純粹之軍需品，如二萬六千噸毒品等，均已毀壞。又作民用者，如一萬六千輛汽車等，已移交於民用經濟。第八軍大批剩餘物資（約七萬三千噸）已售與日本，價格約爲原價之三分之一弱。一般而言，日本人民與佔領軍之合作極佳，美國女子可在日本到處行走，保證安全。日本人民喜愛並尊敬美國軍隊，若干市鎭之美軍撤退時，居民均請求再派軍隊前去。</p>
<h3>羅政府在全國各地　再搜捕反對黨人　農民黨主席馬紐亦在被捕之列</h3>
<p>〔路透社羅馬尼亞京城十六日電〕今晨消息，二十四小時　，羅京及各省被捕之羅反對黨人員已達三百人之多。</p>
<p>〔路透社羅馬尼亞京城十五日電〕過去二十四小峙中，羅國京城及各省又有反對黨人約一百人被捕，其中大冬爲國家農民黨之黨民，包括該黨主席馬紐等。</p>
<p>馬氏現年七十四，爲羅國農民黨之共同創立人及黨魁，一九二年—三〇年間任該黨主席，一九二八—三〇年間及一九三三—三三年間兩度任內開總理。一九三三年因與政府意見不睦，退出政治，然至一九二四年又參加參議院並出任副總理。渠於上星期二曾發表談話，謂羅馬尼亞政府自違抗人民之意志接黨政權以來，除傷害輿論及人民之利益外，別無其他作爲。其捕者有農民黨副主席米海萊斯古，秘書長班那斯古及其妻，前內閣閣員拉薩爾夫婦，卡朗狄諾夫婦，及馬尼沃之秘書柯波索，米海萊師古之秘書霍萊索等。國家農民黨黨部及其報紙均已由警察佔領，另一報紙亦被停刋數日。</p>

<h3>房租標準辦法訂定　議決不得片面增加　須按實際開支酌加利潤協議決定　收取小費處三倍以下罰鍰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市房租標準問題爭辯已久，迄未解決。市參議會第三次大會開會時，市府會擬訂本市房租暫行辦法提交討論，該項暫行辦法規定房租標準之最高額不得超過二十六年基數之一千八百倍，經市參議會第三次大會第七次會議決議保留，仍交由市府根據實際情形改訂房租標準。市參議會已於日前將該項議決案函請市府辦理。嗣市府又接全國經濟委員會函請妥擬穩定京滬房租具體辦法，以使交會討論，經第八十四次市政會議決議召集本市有關機關開會討論，以謀集思廣益。</p>
<p>昨日下午三時市府於會議室召開會議，吳市長因主持另一會議，派秘書長沈宗濂代表主持。出席地政局長祝平，專門委員吳遵義，秘書楊卓　，地方法院民　長徐福基，房地產業公會理事長馬少荃，市參議員馬君碩，邵永生暨社會局，財政局，市商會等代表共四十餘人。經熱烈討論後，歸納各方意見，擬具上海市房屋租賃管理辦法，即將由市府公佈施行。該項辦法如下：</p>
<p>（一）本市房屋租額應儘量維持現狀，不得片面任意增加。如有調整必要，應按房主對於該項房屋實際支出（包括房捐，地價稅，租賃所得稅，保險費，里弄路燈，消防龍頭及看守人工資等），及酌加利潤（以上列各種實際支出總數之百分之十爲準），協議決定之。</p>
<p>協議不成得請調處</p>
<p>（二）房主房客不能成立協議時，得依土地法第一〇一條之規定，向主管官署申請調處之。不服調處者應向司法機關起訴。但在未經司法機關裁判以前，應暫照調處結果辦理。</p>
<p>（三）凡歷學校，慈善團體，自治機關，文化社團租用或公敎人員居住之房屋，其租金標準按戰前基數最高不得超過公敎人員薪金倍數之八成。</p>
<p>（四）承租人不得將所租房屋全部轉租他人。其依照民法第四四三條第一項但書之規定，以一部份房屋分租者，無論居住或營業用屋，其租金應按房屋分租部份與原租金額比例計算，最高不得超過原租金一倍。原有担保金者其計算法亦同。</p>
<p>（五）定期租賃之租約，其租期不得少於一年。不滿一年者視爲一年。</p>
<p>禁用外幣·給付租金</p>
<p>（六）租金按月給付，並不得以外幣或實物計算。其原以外幣或實物計算者，應依訂立租約日之匯率及實物市價折成法幣，嗣後繳租即以法幣爲準。</p>
<p>（七）房屋出租除組金外，得收祖保金，其最高額不得超過二個月租金之總額。違反前項規定者，超過部份應返還承租人。</p>
<p>（八）出租人除租金及担保金外，不得收取小費或其他任何名義之費用。違反者除全部返還外，並由主管官署處以三倍以下之罰鍰</p>
<p>（九）本辦法自公佈之日施行。</p>
<p>業主方面力爭主張打破現狀</p>
<p>昨日討論時爭辯甚爲熱烈，房地產業公會代表周仲潔十張於房屋實際支出項內，應加經租費用，折舊，另加合法利潤。並主張打破現狀以求公平合理。市參議員邵永生籲請業主應體念現値非常時期，社會經濟不安定，業主要求利潤固予同情，但市民負担能力亦須顧及。周仲潔以爲市民負祖能力實不必顧慮，於訂定章則時每以爲市民不能負祖，實則房租即使再加高，市民亦能負祖云云。並舉例稱，匯豐大樓每間房間月租八百萬，亦有以生活指數爲房租計算標準者，求租者仍甚衆。但經大會討論後，終爲否決，訂定原辦法如上。</p>
<h3>金潮案擴大偵查　宣告不起訴處分</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金潮案自經參政員羅衡檢舉，司法行政部令飭本市高檢處轉發地檢處擴大偵查以來，承辦該案之丁傳恩檢察官曾迭傳被告貝祖詒，林凰苞，楊安仁等訊問，昨將偵查結果發表，予以不起訴處分。茲將不起訴處分書原文控錄於後；「被告林鳳苞，楊安仁，係前中央銀行業務局正副局長，奉令自去年三月起辦理黃金配售事宜，配售方法分明配暗售二種，明配由金銀兩業同業公會申請核發，暗售則經指定同豐餘等五家轉售，每日配售之數量及價格，均由被告等共同核定。惟自實施配售以來，黃金市價匪特紊亂靡常，抑且暴漲不已。本年二月間參政員羅衝等四人，以被告等事前旣未妥愼籌劃，事後又不能平抑金價，不無利用職權，官商勾結，破壞國策，非法圖利之貧汚嫌疑，提經參政會駐會委員會決議後，轉發偵查到庭。按特種刑事案件，司法警察官署用移送書逕送法院審判之案件，以提起公訴論，爲特種刑事案件訴訟條例第三條所明定。查本件被告等犯罪行爲，前經揭發後，業由淞滬警備司令部繕具移送書，連同有關案卷，逕送本院刑庭審判有案。而該被告等茲爲參政員所控犯罪情節，經核又係同一案件，依諸首開法條規定，無論該被告等有否刑責，應由刑庭認定，本處自無置議之餘地。除貝祖詒因無犯罪行爲，業經懲戒處分外，合依特種刑事訴訟條例第一條第一項，刑事訴訟法第二三四條第一項，處分不起訴。」</p>
<h3>林鳳苞無罪　檢察官不服</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕金潮案自經地院於七月十二日宣告林鳳苞無罪，楊安仁判處徒刑七年，詹蓮生判處徒刑四年後，是項判決書已於昨日送達地檢處。昨據檢察官表示，業務局配售黃金舞弊，旣經地院刑庭判決認定，林鳳苞身爲局長，豈有不知之理。故該項判決殊欠公允，表示不服，將於法定期間十天內考慮向高院提起上訴。</p>
<h3>卅六年所利得稅　稅局決定新辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕三十六年度所利得稅標準計稅，本市直接稅局已決定新辦法，依照谷工商行號申報數字，凡營業額在四億元以上，收益額在二億元以上者，以查賬計稅爲原則。此種商行本市約有二千單位，佔全數三十分之一，營業額在四億元以下，收益額在二億元以下者仍以分業抽查賬册，決定計稅標準。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕三十六年度所利得稅，自財部核准原則仍應查帳，惟爲爭取稅收時問起見，已按照上海工商業單位實際情形，將應行標準計稅之範圍擴大，各業以抽查百分之五爲原則，市商會自奉批後，已分函各業知照，日來呢絨，五金，進出口，顏料各業之應查單位，均已按時將帳册送往稅局查核，查帳時幷有商會代表及同業公會負責人協同辦理，經過極爲良好。又據稅局表示，如查定之稅款，納稅義務人認爲有疑義時，應於換到繳款通知單十日內，先向國庫繳納稅款一半，一面申請覆查，逾期依法不能受理。如於限期內旣不按照法定程序申請覆查，又不繳款者，即移送法院罰辦。</p>

<h3>北太平洋首次客機　上海號今午抵滬　預定停留兩小時再飛馬尼刺　乘客中有董顯光夫人公子等</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美西北航空公司北太平洋航綫第一次客機「上海號」，自美經阿拉斯加日本飛上海馬尼刺，預定今午十一時五十分可以飛抵本市龍華機塲。乘客中有新問局長董顯光夫人及公子等。該機並帶來美各界名流對我蔣主席張羣院長及吳市長致敬之文件，具名者有華盛頓州長華格倫，西雅圖市長台汶，華盛頓大學校長愛倫博士及西雅圖各界領袖。該機抵滬，停留兩小時後，即須續飛馬尼刺，然後自馬尼刺循原路返美，故自滬至美北太平洋航綫之處女客航將於本星期六上午七時起飛。此後每星期一三六飛航三次。本市郵政管理當局對於首次發交該機運美航空函件，將加蓋特製該綫首次飛航紀念日戳，以資紀念。寄交美日航空普通函件，定於本月十八日十六時封發，寄美航空掛號函件，提前一小時封發。</p>
<h3>美國許中書遲遲未發來　中航客機昨未飛美</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國航空公司中美航綫開航以來僅有月餘，昨日忽告中斷。緣該綫班機原定每月一日暨十六日由上海飛出兩班，但昨日班機並未飛出，其原因據悉係由該公司向美民航局申請之許可經營證書，因公文種種必經程序迄今尚未發下。以往幾次係經美民航局之同意，以國內機關包機性質飛航，但此次班機並無機關包機，故雖有其他乘客，亦不得不照美民航局之規定而取消。美民航局對於許可證發給之遲緩，與我國民航局對美國航空公司許可書核准之迅速，適成反比。現我民航局已爲此事發電美民航局催促迅速辦理，一俟准許，中航公司之中美班機，即可照常飛航云</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕昨日午後三時，白崇禧，王寵惠，孫科，黃、紹竑，吳國楨，黃旭初爲救濟兩廣水災，聯名招待本市各界領袖，有所會商。當通過由兩廣賑災會呈請中央准予發行「救災獎券」，一俟核准，先由金融界　購一部，以應急需。並議決成立籌募委員會，以求事權專一，全力籌款。公推宋子文爲主任委員，吳國柏，杜月笙，潘公展，徐寄　爲副主任委員，王先青爲總幹事。籌募委員爲王正廷，王曉籟，吳開先，李叔明，李　　，奚王書，徐學禺，吳蘊初，陳伯莊，趙棣華，程滄波，楊嘯天，秦潤卿等，共計六十一人，以後如有需要，隨時可予以增加。本市籌募目標定爲廣東五百億元，廣西三百億元，進行之詳細辦法，由宋子文與杜月笙等洽商後，再行決定。茲將昨日開會情形，扼要分誌如下：</p>
<p>招待會於三時假金門飯店九樓皇宮　舉行，出席各界領袖二百餘人，主席國由白崇禧，黃紹竑，吳國楨代表出席。白部長首先致辭，希望各界領袖即研究救災辦法，解除兩廣災民之痛苦，並感謝吳市長之協助。</p>
<p>市長致辭鼓吹解襄</p>
<p>吳市長繼起發言，謂本人有一種感想，即今日上海雖經濟凋蔽，生活不易，但就全國而論，市民實居福地。在抗戰中，上海固有損失，但與後方遭受轟炸之大城市相較，則又不能比擬。以戰時負担而言，四川一省即川壯丁一千六百萬，每年出糧二千萬石，不可謂不重。以目前情形而論，華北爲一大戰塲，平津深受影響，其困窘尤過於上海。華南則有三十年來未有之大水災。本救災恤隣之義，上海應慷慨解囊。且華南之水災，與本市經濟亦息息相關。故在實際利害上言，本市亦當全力救濟兩廣之　。</p>
<p>粵省議長詳述災情</p>
<p>市長辭畢，主席團繼請前日抵滬之廣東省參議長林冀中報告災情。林氏列舉損失數字，並謂修堤爲當務之急，否則粤省濱海，潮水來時，水勢已退之區，重將淹沒。估計修理費用爲白米三萬噸（工賑），國幣四百億（材料費）。至於急賑方面，已成立水災緊急救濟會，已發放賑米八萬担。將來向南洋購米時，希望政府在外匯上于以便利。同時，爲根絕兩廣水災，當進行建設性之水利工程，此點尚需與水利部洽商。</p>
<p>女參議員報告救災</p>
<p>廣東女參政員伍智梅繼起報告廣東救災情形，謂於六月廿一日至七月十日之間，共收到實物及現款共計一百四十億元左右，均已發放於東江西江珠江災區。目前除在廣東各縣市自行籌募米款外，並由代表晋京向中央洽商下列各事：（一）行政院撥款一百億元急賑，目前只准三十億。（二）三十五年度廣東征實之二十萬擔米穀，暫不提用，以保急賬。（三）向　　購糧一萬噸，請中央准撥官價外匯，以救災黎。（四）呈請糧食部，受災區域之田賦分別减免。（五）呈請農林部，撥給災區耕具肥料。以廣東災情而言，急賑尚需食糧三萬噸，否則需國幣九百億元。</p>
<p>鼓掌通過委員名單</p>
<p>廣東兩代表報告災情後，杜月笙即提議成立籌募委員會，尋即鼓掌通過宋子文等六十一委員之名單。杜氏復請各界領袖貢戲募款辦法，駱清華主張發行「救災獎券」，以求特久及普遍。並謂：如一期募捐一百億，以二成作爲獎金及開支，亦可凈得八十億，如此連辦五六期，不難達到目標。同時此舉可凍結興風作浪之游資，與本市民生亦有裨益。王曉籟表示：救災如救火，貴在迅速及時，主張先由銀行界墊款，將來以募捐所得之款償還，證之過去實例，此法甚屬可行。此舉之成功與否，全視努力之程度而定。</p>
<p>兩省急賬需八千億</p>
<p>網由王先靑張伉龍發言，謂曾訪宋子文洽商此事，廣東急賑需款五千億元希望在上海募五百億；廣西急賑需三千億，希望在滬募三百億。此時杜月笙即謂；有宋子文擔任主委，事情即好辦，民國十九年長江大水災，困難過於今日，但因宋氏負責救災，問題竟能解決。今日宋先生肯負責，銀行墊款可無問題。詳細辦法，擬與其洽商後再作決定。杜氏之建議，與會人士均表贊同。最後主席團由吳市長代表發言，略謂對發行「救災獎券」之辦法，甚表贊同，惟此事須經中央核准，一俟核准後，當先請銀行界墊購一部份，以應災區之急需。甚盼各界人士，本救災卹鄰之義，全力推動此事云。會議至此已逾六時，即在興奮空氣中散消。</p>

<h3>銀根緊俏巿塲空氣轉變　本巿物價普遍回跌　工商界對國貨外銷多抱殷憂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本巿一般商品巿况日來因（一）銀根緊俏，（二）魏德邁使華，（三）美國務院將開放日本封外貿易等等原因，普遍展開跌風，昨日更全而報小。舉其　　大者，　股普遍軋跌。廿支雙馬一千萬元，較前跌九十萬元。四十二支藍鳳一七二〇萬元，較前跌一五〇萬元。細支紗多已跌入議價限度內。十二磅龍頭細布四十二萬八千元，較前跌一萬七千元。白粳三十九萬元，較前跌五千元。青島　生油七十七萬元，較前跌四萬元。一二〇號天橋人造絲二六七〇萬元，較前跌九〇萬元。七八D級廠三一五〇萬，尚乏受主。其他各種商品，除捲菸因霧季已過，且七月廿六日貨物稅則將調整，遂告止跌向堅外，一般趨勢，均呈　　，實為近月來物價直綫上漲聲中，僅見之好現象。</p>
<p>銀根緊俏，起因於國家行局之鉅額差入。計週一差入五〇三億元，週二差入三八二億元，至昨日始差出一七七億元。昨日上午銀根仍緊，惟午後中國銀行詎額差出三六〇餘億元，銀根方漸見回鬆。惟國行仍差入一六九億元，外商銀行差人一〇九億元，五十號前交換行莊座入二一八億元，五十號後者差出一五〇億元。日前銀根奇緊時，有差千行莊，軋賑至深夜始告軋平。致日前銀錢業　　準備會，亦差出頭寸七十餘億元，昨日聞僅差出十餘億元。暗息在二角二三分間。</p>
<p>此外魏德邁使華，一般觀感，對借款前途，又縐樂觀。並認為魏使此行，有促成借款　趨向。再如日本對外貿易開放後，因麥帥總部將採取貼補出口政策，加以日本一般工繳，均較我低廠多多，故本巿工商界，對未來國貨之外銷前途，不無把憂。因此對手頭執貨，紛紛斬售。此亦為引起日來商品轉跌之一大主因云。</p>
<h3>銀根緊·華股跌　信和增資揭曉塲上首先跌停</h3>
<p>華股昨除景綸微升，新亞國貨平平外，其餘各次熱及雜牌。一致慘降。越熱者所跌越多，此乃銀根緊迫，退慕纍纍，缺單者幾有難以張羅之苦，有以致之。信和增資案決定贈十一，（其中兩股屬利息項下所撥付者）而認十二，多方幻夢擊破，首先跌至限度。水紗在最後一天交易中，買方亦無餘戀，臨收前亦曾跌倅，前途已呈　淡。</p>
<p>晨開時即因隔前交換時，國行仍有大量差繼而見低，瀘永紗開後，即自一〇一〇元跌至九六〇〇元。九七號二二〇號二二六號一八〇號一七七號進至九八八〇元，一九七號一五四號五四號又賣到九六五〇元，二一八號二二〇號四五號八二號二三六號進至九九九〇元，九七號二二三叼二二〇號二三五號一一二號仍有供給，再將瀘永紗迫低至九七〇〇元內，十時四十五分後，買氣仍易復戰，二二四號二號一五七叼三五號九七號四號八五號五六號一五二號二二〇號等來進，瀘永紗曾最後一度升至九九七〇元，三五號一七一號八九號九一號二三五號賣出，退至九七〇〇元，二一九號二一八號進至九八〇〇元外。信和股東會元完畢，贈股大失所望，開始潰散，間接影響整個股巿。瀘永紗經七六號二一七號二一三號一五五號二三號一七號二一三號一五五號二三號一八〇號一八三號二二六號均加了結，一七一號並售濾永紗，信和經大量存多了結。一八一號四五號亦有出籠，十二時一刻遞信和首先跌停，永紗　入九四〇〇元，現永紗亦達九三五〇元低價。八五號一〇四號乘低進至五五〇〇元外，無如各項物價一致下降，並傅利賣謠言，八五號二三五號一八一號一〇二號六五號再賣，一五號廣帶再買現永紗，十二時二十五分遞永紗迫低停板，現永紗亦路至九三〇〇元內，六八號九一號一六號尚有補進，升至九三八〇元。六五號五四號二一五號脫售，午收以九三二〇元之價結束。收後一五七號五〇號六九號一五四號一一六號均進，喊高至九四〇〇元外。結果較前收計即交股新光永公動興中法跌半成强，永紗信和美亞新華各跌一成光景，華豐跌一成强，景綸獨告微升，內衣徵挫，新亞國貨麗安平平，五和火柴大通商務中絲跌半成，統一榮豐永泥各挫一成。遞交股計華繼跌半成，新光景福美亞各跌半成强，永公勤興跌一成弱，永紗信和跌停後有回，軋跌一成及一成半弱。塲外各老股計中華閘北南洋五洲微降，餘均平疲而已。</p>
<h3>統債平和　外股續挫</h3>
<p>公債昨稍平和，丙戊已略回升，而雜牌降落少許。統丙晟開六九〇〇元，抵至六六〇〇元，升至七〇〇元結束，五五五室來進，而五〇三室及潤德則出，結果較前收計甲乙低一〇〇元，統丁降二〇〇元，統丙升二〇〇元，統戊亦漲三〇〇元，成交約一百餘萬。</p>
<p>外股昨因刺激性繼續减低，而業外物資亦起跌風，乃呈疲軟之象。怡紗晨開六九〇〇〇元，而以六七〇〇〇元結束，散戶及錢兌業雖納，證券帮及銀行帮有供，結果較前收計業廣尚平，怡啤英聯鋼業航業各跌半成强，紙業跌一成不到，餘股自微挫起迄跌半成弱不等。</p>

<p>繼郎討論提案六起，茲誌最重要之二起如次：（一）該會前分呈行政院曁四聯總處等各當局，力爭對各廠自備一成資金，及百分之十利潤，准均折合發給生絲，或僅八成解繳，俾留二成生絲，調劑巿塲。茲悉四聯總處電復協導會，應由政府全部收買，不得保留一部份自行銷售，提請討論案。討論經過，議決：推周元勳，王化南，顧速明，願達一，陸仲烈，高景岳，杜聯馥，張恩生等八人另組小組會，於十八日下午討論解決辦法，並代表出席十九日召開之蠶絲產銷協導委員會提出討論。各出席理監事，以當時各廠自備一成資金，大多係出售生絲而籌集。合法利潤一成，亦應給予現貨。以備週轉。否則，各絲廠所需之絲，殆將無法供應（二）連元絲廠提案：為春　結束已一月，各廠盼望早日開車，而先決務件。（甲）續費請協導會採取寬裕而具彈性為付繅　半個月，以供週轉。（乙）燃料配給，恐給困難，請協導會轉商中農行，撥款照巿價購買全部絲廠一個月所需煤斤榮油，導各廠所在地中農會庫，由廠備務領用，請討論案。決議通過，待陳請協導會採納施行。</p>

<p>麵粉供不應求，繼續猛跌三五千元。法　永豐二三千元。</p>
<p>豆餅實　求　，疲而少　，營口餅東北有　，人心虛軟，再跌六七千元。黃豆納戶看望，續跌三五千至萬元。　豆南洋消化轉懈，止漲轉跌，挫落萬元。赤豆供求兩稀，無甚軒輊。</p>

<p>油巿狂漲暴跌，動　甚烈火，廣甬兩帮完全停辦，各油一致猛烈慘跌三四五萬元不一。</p>
<h3>賣戶貶價吐售　人造絲又告挫跌　廠經沉寂綢貨人心甚虛</h3>
<p>人造絲昨巿因銀根甚緊，交易極稀，需要頭寸者，不得不貶價脫手，以致又告挫降。一二〇號高山有光，開盤價二千七百三十萬元，盤旋至七百二十萬元為中午收盤價，下午續告降跌，由六百九十萬元至最後七十萬元收盤。天橋七百八十萬元，東洋七百九十萬元，俱比上日短去一百萬元强。</p>
<p>廠經巿况，連朝沉寂，昨行情被告低落，高勻度喊價比上日小五十萬元，仍乏受主而無成交。零担成交價力上日短去一百萬元左右，中級貨在二千九百萬至三千萬元之間，高級零担三千零五十萬至一百萬元，做開數量極少。干經喊價，昨亦降落五十萬元之譜。</p>
<p>綢貨因原料續疲，人心甚虛，故一致下降。大誠被面先喊一百四十萬元，後經大戶拋售，成交價為三十四萬及三十三萬元。最後價跌至三十萬元。華强被面由三十五萬元跌至三十萬元，最後二十五萬元有人要。大誠格子璧縐三萬六千四五百元開巿，最後做六千二百元，隔日期六千五百元，華錦縐下午巿價跌落一千元，高檔貨成交價為二萬四千元。</p>
<h3>塲內供多求少　紗布繼續下瀉</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗巿况，以申新廠開出旣多，又値紡建公司開售之期，巿上銀根依然緊俏，塲內賣氣瀰漫。並傅美貸即將成功，人心極度渙散，新買躊躇，做開四二支藍鳳低至一千七百二十萬為收價，比紡建開價低廉數萬，較之上日繼瀉一百五十萬元之鉅。</p>
<p>廿支特雙馬收價亦小至一千一百二十萬，步降八十萬元。雙馬紗為一千萬元，軋小九十萬。其餘四二支水月寶光四十支金城卅二支藍鳳銀月，及廿支天女人鐘十六支光明十支童子軍等粗細紗，一致扯降三四十萬至一百餘萬元不一云。</p>
<p>昨日棉布巿况，因行莊對信用貸放步步緊縮，同業頭寸抽緊，塲內賣氣籠罩，行情步開步低，十二磅龍頭細布結果低至四十一萬八千元，比上日繼續猛降二萬七千，五福彩球藍鷄陽鶴各檔細布，亦一致續跌二萬二至三萬元，其餘漂布細布及色布士林布等，亦均跟小五千至二萬五千元，惟元布及粗布所跌甚微。</p>
<h3>棉織業聯營公司　昨開首次評議會</h3>
<p>〔本巿訊〕中國棉織業產銷聯營公司，為棉織品外銷南洋，爭取外匯來源事，該公司徐董事長文照，曾三度派副董事長傅良駿，總經副理錢承緒，呂葆卿等晋京，經當局特許列席本月十二日召開之全國經濟會議，經出席各委員極力支持下，原則予以通過，開政府協助民族工業之先聲。昨下午四時，該公司開第一次評議會議，由傅良駿主席，出席參因六單位計襯衫，汗衫，針織，手帕，被單，毛巾等組主任委員王　·姚思偉·羅慶蕃·徐照候及該公司常董李道發等二十餘人，當由傅主席報告此次赴京列席全經會議經過情形甚詳，並感謝政府領導與協助，略謂當局原則雖已通過，然技術問題，尚待確切研討，當局意見，須以「標準商品第一」，盼同人努力從事，增强生產，以副政府振興工業及符合新經濟方　為前提。</p>
<p>評議會議內容，據悉：着重認「爭取時機」，「確定成本」，「數量分配」，「存貨彙報」，「利潤」，「產銷契約」等諸問題，討論甚久，尤以產銷合作契約，檢討週密，一致通過，於八時散會，傅日內將再行召開重要會議。</p>

<h3>台糖配期延長　改為每二週一次　每次配額較以前增多一倍</h3>
<p>台糖公司對配售食糖，因客戶眾多，以往第週配售一次，於手續上　多困難，故原定今日申請配糖，現決將配售期限延長，改為每二週配售一次。每次配額較　增多一倍，第二十四期改於下週四申請配售。</p>
<p>社會局長吳開先昨稱：最近該局接獲台糖公司呈稱：本期戶口配糖與巿價相差達每斤五千元，因而黃牛黨　機活躍，本期糖栗已有巿價，要求社局考慮，惟社局認為如講糖除用糖票外，並需出示巿民證，則似屬苛求，現擬將八月份配價提高至每斤五千元左右，藉免巿儈取利。雖抑平糖價為最澈底辦法，但因台幣匯率時起變動，無法實行云。</p>
<p>糖價續跌</p>
<p>昨糖巿因銀根仍緊，續見下降。公會劃盤，台糖三檔照加，初為六萬五千元，旋降至六萬元五萬元。二〇中砂白六十三四萬元，台赤五十六萬五千元。秘魯砂六十八萬元，各降二萬許。及下午各檔又小萬元之譜。土糖亦平疲，汕提青四十六萬元至四十五萬六千元，棉赤五十一萬元，興化白高貨六十一萬元，次之五十九萬元。興赤四十六萬五千元，次之四十三四萬元，海南赤四十六萬元，統共成交五百餘件。</p>
<h3>捲菸稅率調整　改為百分之一百</h3>
<p>財政部上海貨物稅局，決定於二十六日起，實施調整捲菸稅率為普遍提高百分之一百，聞其徵收辦法，係採取四捨五十制，以期一律十元　位，例如原稅率二十一萬元，增加百分之一百當為四十二萬元，然僅作四十萬元繳納。而四十五萬元以上者則作五十萬元計算。此次新稅率中，以每箱四十萬為最低，其最高額為三百九十萬元。上項辦法稅局已正式通知各菸廠，一體知照。</p>
<p>捲烟回</p>
<p>昨日捲烟巿况，因門莊帮添辦活潑，兼以上日跌勢過猛，不乏見低補吸，巿勢仍趨堅挺。午巿交易尚佳，惟銀根仍緊，又逢華成公司派銷美麗牌烟，甲卡一箱，乙卡四十條，丙卡二十條，配價每條四萬七千五百元。</p>
<p>中華公司今（十七日）亦派甲等同行雙斧牌烟一箱，全祿一箱，乙等各一百五十條，丙等一百條。雙斧配價每條二萬四千元，全祿一萬三千二百元，故結果漲勢遭挫。</p>
<p>十支大英老刀兩烟均比上日祗升二十萬元，大英為八百五十二萬，老刀七百三十八萬元，其餘華商廠之金鼠百萬金白蘭地紅金牌等條烟亦帶升四五百至一千二百元。惟美貨駱駝馬力司條烟，及聽頭烟巿仍平穩。</p>

<h3>紗商業公會代表　請紡綢恢復配紗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本巿紗商業同業公會理事長唐志良，理事沈伯琴，席少蓀等於昨日下午三時許，往記紡調會代主委劉泗英，適劉氏公忙，由該會秘書處長袁促達代公司停止配紗以來，即恃各民營廠配紗維持。茲因民營廠方面產紗百分之七十五，均將繳歸政府，故開紗更少，致紗商無法維持營業。本巿紗號共八百餘家，從業人員達萬餘人，生計堪虞，加以外埠各小工業，向均恃紗商運銷供應，今均無處仰給。故為調劑紗巿盈虛，維持紗商營業計，仍請復配。袁氏當表示：對紗商之配紗問題，在紡綢會調節實施方案中，就有規定，正靜待經濟方案中，已有規定，正靜待經濟部核示後，方能遵循辦理，目前仍請各紗商就民營廠少數配紗，姑維殘局云云。</p>
<h3>棉巿賡續下游</h3>

<h3>收購猪鬃桐油　刻又修正辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中信局息：收購猪鬃桐油實施辦法，刻有新修正，現已再交由輸出推廣會執委會研討中，不久可望公布。又該局收購卅五年度陳茶一案刻因茶商方面與中央中農兩行尚在接洽未了事宜故迄未開始收購云。</p>
<h3>食油走私南運　數達三千餘大桶</h3>
<p>最近本巿食油發現有私自運往廣州香港一帶者，其數額竟達三千餘大桶（每桶五十三介侖）。社會局方面曾多方偵查，但迄未查獲。經該局呈請巿府，函海關查詢，而海關因該件係屬管制，亦未簽出此項准運證據，各方推測定有人從中走私，刻社會局已請有關機關協助查辦。</p>
<h3>二萬件臨時配銷　配價將不致變更　民廠繳者先照議價結售　再由紡調會桶配予複製業</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會員會第六次例會，已定於今日下午四時，在該會舉行，屆時將對五次例會議時通過之發展紡織工業調節紗布巿塲實施方案，作最後之文字修正，然後呈經濟部核定。聞自政府頒佈總動員令後，該項方案之配合問題，因牽涉範圍頗廣，須待經部提送行政院全國整委會席上，共同商討後方能決定妥善對策。</p>
<p>又該會辦理臨時共同配銷，由國民營紗廠在本月十五日前，各提供棉紗一萬件參加配銷。刻國營廠所提供之一萬件，即將配罄。惟民營廠迄未交足，刻仍為前交之八千餘件。聞關係方面對此二萬件臨時配銷棉紗，有儘本週內配完之說。俾免因議價變更，而影響共同配銷制對各廠之公允性。屆時各廠如繳紗過遲者，勢將先照現行議價，結售予紡調會，然後再由該會按現行議價，補配予複製業。故二萬件之臨時配銷紗，其配價可望不致變更云。</p>

<h3>四平北郊　太平嶺上飄戰旗</h3>
<p>— 余菊人</p>
<p>長春十一日航訊</p>
<p>四平的北郊，有兩塊相連的高地，地圖上標明濟：「六平嶺，」有些人把它呌做「姊妹山」，那裏是兵家必爭之地，因爲它可以控制整個四平，關　極爲重大，無怪乎杜聿明將軍在病榻上，時時以該地工事　念，並時時告訴他的參謀長趙家　，打電話探詢該地攻守的情形。那專的工事，守軍做的　在堅强，共軍做了幾次試探攻擊，結果總是知難而退。</p>
<p>這　是參加那一帶保衛戰的軍甲人員寫的一　記實文章，（讀者）</p>
<p>驚夢佳訊</p>
<p>五月底風，湖暖了大地，北國的一切開始了新生。松花江的洪潮，藉着北極寒流的震蕩又開始泛濫了。看吧！像錢塘的高潮，從江北一直向南，向南……北邊失去了抵擋的長堤。生活在溫柔之鄉地人們，開始憂鬱了，火車站充滿了難民，街道上失去了嚴整，南下的散兵難民像海潮一樣，每個人的心震盪了！</p>
<p>是五月廿五日的淸晨，從西邊開來一列急行列車，汽笛的聲音愉快的告訴在警夢中的人們以好消息：「西邊的生力軍到了」。這是八七師的前衛部隊二六一團。不是他們的主方軍，保衛四平戰中的中流砥柱。目前率領這數千英勇健兒的，是周君平團長，副團長王玉白中校，「二六一團」這幾個字在東北民衆口中不覺生疏。</p>
<p>齊的行列，在街道上行進着，人們對這嚴肅而莊整的隊伍，誰不投以愉快敬仰的目光。他們自車站一隊，一隊開赴防地，這給四平動蕩中的人心，築起了一車不可攻破的安定圍牆。</p>
<p>嚴陣待命</p>
<p>無論讓誰來判斷，以四平當初情勢，北方要較南方爲重要，因此，這重要的一方面，由八十七師二六一團來担　，他們佔領東北自水源地，西北至小北溝全長約五千五百公尺的陣地，在這地區裏，他們利用北山　　曲折的崗嶺作爲前哨，　城廓外圍作成抵抗綫，更利用　　作　第三道防綫，在第三道防綫之後各指揮所，又復構成堅　據點，於是在這廣大地區裏，成了點，綫，面一體的一個錯綜複致的「八陣圖」由於他們上下一致的努力，在極短時期內，築成了堅强無比的防禦工事。</p>
<p>當你站在北山，自北向南一望；那高長的城牆，曲折的戰　，如星羅棋列的堡壘，一道又一道的鐵條綱，鹿砦，蜂窩一般的三角坑……大有不得其門而入之慨：還有那生築蓬勃的荷槍戰士，明先晃的新式武器，眞有說不出的威武，道不盡的莊嚴，他們正嚴陣以待着。</p>
<p>勝利前秦</p>
<p>大戰的序幕拉開了，伴秦着南邊共軍的閃擊北山第三據點打響了頭一砲！這是二六一團最西的前哨戰，守備這個據點的是第二營六連王振山排長所部的三十七個健兒，拱衛着這四平北邊的大門。</p>
<p>誰都担心這孤立無援的小據點的戰鬥，第一次的戰鬥過去了，第二天又是一樣，第三天共軍進攻最厲害，他以一個大隊的兵力　　　　，結果，共軍的一個大隊，完全給打　，一千五百餘人全被消滅，創造了這一首勝利前秦曲！</p>
<p>閃擊猛勢</p>
<p>共軍在南城區的閃擊，顯然已將　　部陣地突破，竄入市區，到達聿明路附近其氣勢之盛，眞如「黃泛」，大有不可遏止之勢。</p>
<p>副團長工玉白中校，他在這危如累卵的局勢中，受命指揮，他率領所部兩個半連，別部配屬步，工兵各一連，以這僅有兵力，在聿明路橫擋共軍銳鋒，一鼓攻克據點兩處，共軍雖以十倍以上兵力臨彼，晝夜猛撲，巷戰三日夜，終未越雷池一步。</p>
<p>一頓好打</p>
<p>轉移陣地後的二六一團陣地，整個部署成「凹」字形，是以火車修理廠的第二營爲凹字的右翼突出點，天橋第三營掃左突出點。像這樣的陣地，攻擊的人，如不先攻兩翼，或打破一冀，面向中央凹部進攻，是絕對不許可的。共軍妄想以極端優勢兵力，從道西越過鐵路，進攻凹字陣地的凹部，來一個中央突破，所以當他們進攻火車修理廠沒有成功的第三天夜（六月廿一日），保一旅全部約四千餘人，即向守備凹字陣地凹部德昌實業公司的第一營進攻，共軍旣然冒險實行中央突破，當然有其先決條件的。所謂先決條件，不外兵力，火力，比防守者佔絕對優勢罷了。</p>
<p>不可否認的，戰鬥確實緊張。共軍用車輪戰法，輪次猛衝，一次不成，又來一次。「衝！殺！嘩啦啦！嘟嘟嘟！」殺聲，砲聲，號聲，震耳欲聾。火球，火團，火綫，五光十色，那眞是一個慘烈的塲面，在戰鬥最慘烈的時候，勇敢的王玉白副團長，親率步兵一排，到德昌公司督戰，誓死不讓共軍打進陣地，多謀的周君平團長更電令凹字陣地兩翼部隊，給共軍預先扯下一條「火力口袋」，並令第二營隨時準備自右翼出擊，以期一舉殲滅來襄共軍於陣前。</p>
<p>共軍的厄運終於降臨了，攻擊沒有成功，拂曉前，不得不趕快撤退。誰知後面來了一個「只准其進而勿使共退」的對鎖射擊。他們剛準備越過鐵道，這凹字陣地兩翼的十餘挺輕重機槍，將鐵路兩側二十多公尺寬的一條走廊，封鎖得水洩不通，向前？是鋼墻鐵壁般的陣地，停止？是萬矢集中的彈巢，只得冒着彈雨向後猛衝，他們成密集球形向後跑，這邊用密集砲火注射，彈像江河倒瀉一樣冲洗過去，人像沙堤一般一排排倒下來，繼之以鐵甲軍的出陣，眞是「一頓好打」！共軍保一旅全部蜀語：「殺角！」却表現了新的　運之　臨。</p>
<p>煙籠天橋</p>
<p>天橋，是二六一團凹字陣地的左突出部，是道東這西的交通咽喉。位　高而突出，天然形成道東整個據點的前哨。無論向南向北，都可發揮側射威力，而且壓制了道西共軍活動，無怪共軍要目爲「眼中釘」，並要櫃掖這顆「眼中釘」。</p>
<p>共軍曾以第七旅全部（十六師）主力，向這兒作了次決定性的進攻。進攻的作風不外一個「猛」，差不多每個二六一團的官兵都知道這三部曲：黃昏「猛打」，（砲轟），入夜「　衝」，沸　「猛退」。所以他們的對策是「嚴密警戒」，「短促猛射」，「火力窮追」，因此，共軍多一次進攻，便多給他們充實一次勝利的內容，共軍對大橋的攻擊，當然又是失敗的了。</p>
<p>天橋，偉大的女神，雖然妳的眞面爲烟霧所籠眾，玉體沐浴着彈雨，然而在這暴風雨中，妳仍是安然無恙，　風吹散了四　的狼煙，你的影子，又偉大而　　地出現了！</p>

<h3>華中避署山莊　鷄公山</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員周漢動</p>
<p>漢口十一日航訊</p>
<p>由於平漢路局的邀請，記者在無意中進了一次　暑勝地的鷄公山！這座名山的開闢，近在光緒三十年，它沒有古蹟，也缺少淸流，論歷史，談風光，品景色，評凉爽，自然都不能與牯嶺相媲美，但從現實的地理環境看，從未來的交通建設看，它却有雄偉倨傲的特質，不失爲一個最堪造化的避暑山莊！</p>
<p>形勢雄偉軍略必爭</p>
<p>鷄公山位於武勝關以北約三十華里，屬於大別山系的支脈，高出海面約二千五百公尺。如果說武勝關是平漢綫上保衛武漢的一座鐵門，則鷄公山便是這鐵門的前哨；因此它在過去成爲軍略上必爭之地，吳佩孚將軍的成敗，多少受了它的恩賜或遺棄！</p>
<p>山巓的最高峯，被目爲鷄頭與鷄冠，它昻着頸項，矗立成豫鄂兩省的分水嶺，好像在瞭望四周，偵察一切。鷄背，雞尾和鷄脚上，幽曲迄邐的山谿，夾着幾座牢固的碉堡，更顯示着它具有一種居高臨下不可侵犯的雄姿！</p>
<p>雞公是雄的，鷄公山也具有它的雄偉性！</p>
<p>乘與爬山逸興遄飛</p>
<p>「遊山避暑，需要閑情逸繳，也許山光的美，不是我們所能完全領略的吧！」一個同業曾有過這樣的感觸。</p>
<p>當我們步出車站，沿山麓小道而上，看到何雪竹先生所題「別有洞天」的牌坊時，自然也湧起一種心曠神怡的想望，但我們一行，在倉忙中坐着椅子爬山，對於一草一木的欣賞，似乎失去了一些敏感，只見山路蜿蜒起伏，兩旁議山疊疊，　覺險巇之中，尚有一番恬靜與優美！</p>
<p>在山上盤桓約一夭光景，從雞公頭而南崗而北崗，我們的眼簾僅掠過全山的一角！這裏，有游潺作響的小溪流，有滿佈浮萍的荷花池，有寂寥肅穆的活佛寺，還有近似濕布的淺紅潮，備管有些是人爲的點綴，然也不能抹煞它天然的幽靜！</p>
<p>鐵路賓館雄據山頂</p>
<p>山莊裏佈置着三個公園，一是中正公園，內有主席下榻過的行轅和防空洞，是二十六年修建的，現在林木花草，都還青葱活潑，欣欣向榮！其他兩個是武樵公園和書霖公園，也正積極加以培植灌　。</p>
<p>這裏的房舍，都是用岩石砌成的西式洋房，高大寬宏，一如都市建築，特別是我們寄住的鐵路賓館，雄據山巔，視綫遠大，在此憑欄四望，或覩旭日東昇，或眺晚霞言歸，或窺羣山隱約，在在充滿詩意，令人樂不思去！雞公山竹枝詞作者劉邃眞君寫過這樣一首詩：「靑烟一縷似開甑，漸裏林　到上層，我已浮沉人海倦，樓窗閑敞看雲升！」大概劉君之詩，不是憑空杜撰的吧！</p>
<p>不，有一位在平漢路局服務二十年的老人說：「這裏的春景更可愛，杜鵑花與桃花爭紅競艷，蘭草與不知名的藥草鬥香，它是紅山，也是香山！」這些美妙的春色，在記者此時固然是可望而不可及，但凉爽的氣氛，襯托着幽靜的山光，確也不愧爲一個避暑山莊了。</p>
<p>韓逆之墓沾汚山光</p>
<p>麻雀雖小，肝膽俱全，這山莊裏的文物，也有可記的特點：在南崗的山坡上，有韓復榘的墓，一般認爲這事有傷名山的光彩，曾發出憤懣的諷刺。前東北中學學生，且曾拔出他原有的碑石，準備換上一個「漢奸韓某」的碑文。後來遭韓某的同僚反對，一直沒有立碑。現在荒塚之旁，莽草叢生，一個奸人的下落，也够悲慘了。</p>
<p>辦理戶藉外人就範</p>
<p>這山的全面積，不過百方里，而敎會區的面積佔了四分之一，總人口不過一，二三八人，而外籍敎徒佔了一四七人，全部房舍，僅二九三棟，而敎會房屋佔了一二三棟，他們自辦兩個學校，一是瑞典學校，一是美文學校，他們過去不納稅，也不報戶口，似乎還過着「治外生活」！近山鷄公山管理局派員辦登記，查戶口，他們才稍稍就範。這一現象，不知是由於我們自己的　　，還　由於我們的放任！住在山上的中　人，似乎都很　切！</p>
<p>地界問題迄未解決</p>
<p>鷄公山的管轄　，一向關着　扭。豫人要管，哪人也要管，去年雖經中央劃歸省府管轄，但南北地界之爭，依然沒有解決。現在的湖北省政府鷄公山管理局，據　着十大。號和五大要政，鼓勵人民養蜂。養鷄，種樹，種菜，並辦有中小學各一所，一般作風　爲實際，但以經費無着，兩個省府都沒有眞正支持，所以一籌莫展，政績無從表現！</p>
<p>交通事業打着先鋒</p>
<p>鷄公山的雄偉，十年來受着敵僞的蹂躪，已是傷塡纍纍了。一百二十四楝有牆無屋的房子，正待人們去重建！</p>
<p>交通打了先鋒，電燈電話，跟着鐵路賓館發出了聲和光！莽草除了，路剷平了。學校建立了，物資充實了，它不僅輔導了政治建設，而且創立了經濟基礎。記者遙望鷄公山嶺，不禁爲交通的偉力所懾服！</p>
<p>交通使鷄公山繁榮了，但願它逐步的繁榮下去！</p>

<h3>聯合國兩年工作新檢討（二）</h3>
<p>七月八日滬聯譯</p>
<p>調查委員會由安理會各理事國代表組成，一九四七年一月卅日在紛爭區開始會議，四月二日會議結束，向安理會提出報告書。</p>
<p>關於希臘局勢，安理會在三四月間，六度會議，討論擬議的美國國援助希臘與土耳其方案，並在安理會作新的決定以前，決議巴爾幹調查委員會應派輔助團駐在紛爭區。另有建議置設特別委員　藉適當的監督，確保希臘獲得的外來援助，祗用以增進希臘人民的利益，但這建議被安理會否決。</p>
<p>一九四六年一月二十一日，烏克蘭促請安理會注意英國和日本軍隊在印度尼西亞對地方居民，採取軍事行動，烏克蘭覺得這情勢威脅國際和平安全的維持。二月十三日派委員會前往印度尼西亞，並對英軍駐在該地事發表聲明的建議，未被採納，這問題便告結束。一九四七年三月，秘書長接得通知，和　政府與印尼政府三月二十五日已在巴達維亞簽訂協定。</p>
<p>叙利亞與黎巴嫩在一九四六年二月四日，將法英軍隊駐在叙利亞與黎巴嫩事，提請安理會注意，並申訴說，法英撤退軍隊的條件，和聯合國憲章的精神與字面都不符合。旋有建議提出，申明雙方將不稍延遲，進行談判，目相信法英軍隊將看談判情形，儘速撤退。這建議未經採納，但法英兩國表示無論如何將實行這建議，終於獲得安理會大多數贊成通過，但常任理事國之一的蘇聯，不加贊同。一九四六年五月，黎巴嫩報告安理會，對談判結果，表示滿意，叙利亞也報告外國軍隊已從該國領土撤退。</p>
<p>一九四六年十月二十六日，英國軍艦兩艘在柯孚海峽被水雷炸壞，水兵四十四名喪生，這種事端，在往日或已引起戰爭。英國與阿爾巴尼亞交換照會後，一月間將這爭端提交安全理事會。</p>
<p>英國要求安理會</p>
<p>查明柯孚海峽數雷，阿爾巴尼亞當局不會不知情的事實，並提議英阿兩國應根據查明事實解決爭端，如果失敗再行提交安理會討論。此一提案贊成者七票，蘇聯不加贊同，但蘇聯爲安理會的常任理事國，故此一提案未經通過。後來英國復提議將此爭端立刻提交國際法院解決，安理會乃在四月九日將此提案通過，五月廿三日聯合國秘書長接獲報告，知英國已在國際法院對阿爾巴尼亞提出控訴。</p>
<p>依照對義大利擬行訂立的和平條約，特利雅斯　應關爲自由區，而由聯合國確保該區的完全和獨立，其今着爲安理會必須保護該區居民的基本人權，並須維持其公共秩序，和安全，安理會於一九四七年一月十日通過上項計劃，並接受其應負的責任。責任之一，爲對義大利與南斯拉夫的商議後任命該區行政長官。</p>
<p>舊金山簽訂憲章第二年，即今年春季，聯合國遭遇當今爭執最烈的巴力斯坦問題，由大會召開特別會議，成立特別委員會，調查巴力斯坦問題，並對該地將來成立何種政府提出建議。</p>
<p>此一會議係徇委任統治巴力斯坦之英國要求，四月廿八日在「佛拉興草塲」舉行，經三星期的激烈討論，大會聽取阿拉伯與猶太代表雙方面陳述，最後決定或立調查委員會，由澳火利亞·加拿大·捷克·瓜地瑪拉·　度伊朗·和蘭·秘魯·瑞典·烏拉圭·南斯拉夫十一國的代表組成。「五大張國」都不參加。</p>
<p>大會作此決議三星期後，調查委員會在紐約開會，完成組織計劃，然後啓程前赴耶路撒冷，調查委員　的權力，很廣泛，包括隨電聽取任何人的意見，和前往任何地點調查。</p>
<p>調查委員會須在九月一日前完成調查報告，以便聯今國各會員國能在大會召開下屆例會前，獲得機會，研究該委員會所提建議</p>
<p>大會一致續請有關人民，尤其是巴力斯坦人民，避免任何行動妨礙此問題的及早解決。</p>
<p>一九四六年四月，波蘭要求安理會考慮西班牙因佛朗哥政權的存在和活動而引起的局勢，並採取憲章所規定的辦法，安理會當派小組委員會硏究局勢，而於一九四六年六月廿八日決議促使波茨坦，舊金山會議，聯合國大會及安理會譴責佛朗哥政權的種種事實，已經小組委員會調查確實，所以決定繼續注意這局勢，以便隨時準備採取爲維持國際和平及安全所必要的步驟。</p>
<p>一九四六年十一月四日，安理會從其議程中剔除西班牙局勢問題，而將全部有關記錄和文件，移交大會處置，大會遂於十二月廿一日通過決議案，宣布弗朗哥政權不能代表西班牙人民，並建議西班牙政府不得在聯合國所成立或與聯合國有關的國際機關任會員國，同樣聯合國和上述國際機關的會議或活動，也不許弗朗哥西班牙參加，大會又建議，如果在合理之時期內，西班牙尚無代表民意的政府產生，則安理會應考慮適當辦法，此外聯合國全體會員國應從西班牙召回其大使或公使。</p>
<p>裁軍與原子管制</p>
<p>如果大小國家，都能同意裁軍，則世人將知世界終已眞正走上恒久安全的道路，聯合國對這和平的關鍵問題，究已有些什麽成就？一九四六年十二月十四日大會在紐約集議，通過一項決議案，此案原是蘇聯提出，請安全理事會立刻考慮切實辦法：（一）調整並裁减軍力與軍備，（二）確保各國全體實行此等辦法。因此擬定的計劃，應提交聯合國各會員國，並在大會特別會議中提出討論。同日，大會請安理會在可能範圍　連決定關於聯合國軍力的情報，此項軍力，應請各會員國供給，以使實施第一項決議案。</p>
<p>安理會因此在一九四七年二月十三日設置規定軍備委員會，由安理會各理事國代表組成，奉令在不出三個月內備就並向大會提出建議，以便實行大會的決議案，該委員會在三月二十四日召開會　，至今還在進行，其任務中</p>
<p>大會面臨一問題，人類文化的存　，全靠這問題的解決，所以大會率在倫敦開會時，便設置原子能委員會，照法國代表說來，這是混亂興和平之間的取捨，大會畢竟一致選取了和平途徑，原子能委員會受命儘速探討原子能管制問題的各方面，並提出特殊建議，俾擴大各國間爲和平目的而交換茲本料學情報，管制原子能。直到爲保障原子能應用於和平目的所必要的程度，消除各國軍備中的原子武器及其他一切足以集體毀滅的重犬武器，藉監督及其他方法，作有效的保障，以保護遵守協議的國家，不遭到他國破壞或逃避協議的危險，委員會由安理會各理事國及加拿大各推派代表一人組成，（當時加拿大還不是安理會理幕國）一九四六年六月十四日在紐約召開第一次會議，同年十二月十四日大會通過裁軍決議案，敦促該委員會迅速履行其任務規定，又請安理會迅速審議該委員會的報告書，以及樹立國際管制與監督制度的草約。</p>
<p>十二月三十一日原子能委員會向安理會提出第一次報告，內含硏究結果和建議，一九四七年三月十日，安理會討論此報告書後，復囑該委員會賡續探討國際管制原子能問題的各方面，並在相當時間內擬就條約或協定草案，列入其最後建議提交安理會，更在九月十六日大會下屆會議前，提出第二次報告書。原子能委員會研討安理會的決議案，決定將各項有關問題交所屬執行小組委員會及第二小組委員會討論。爲使安理會得以維持——</p>

<h3>批評者的苦悶</h3>
<p>— 胡山源</p>
<p>去年秋在本報「春秋」上，寫過「苦悶篇」，想出了五個苦悶，那就是：「讀者的苦悶」，「作者的苦悶」，「編者的苦悶」，「出版者的苦悶」，和「現境的苦悶」。現在想想，其中實在還缺少了「批評者的苦悶」，而其地位則和「作者的苦悶」差不多，應處於「讀者」與「編者」之間。</p>
<p>批評者有什麼苦悶呢？批評者的苦悶是大的，至少不會小於作者或編者。</p>
<p>我們看見了一本好書，不免要想：爲什麼批評者不與以介紹呢？看見了一本壞書，也要想：爲什麼批評者不予以指摘呢？某人的作風如何，思想如何，我們希望批評者吿訴我們；某種思想的流行，某種技巧的正確與否，我們也希望批評者指示我們。我們希望批評者，盡其批評的責職，提高寫作的程度，使學術進步，文化發達。我們對他的希望是大的，並且是迫切的。</p>
<p>可是現在的批許者怎樣呢？大多數是「反舌無聲」，不發一言。偶而流露於報章雜誌上的批評，雖不至千篇一律，却大都免不了只有頌揚，沒有指摘。尤其壞的，要是寫作者是一個無藉之名的人，批評者總只是忍略過甚，不與一顧。反之，是一個名流學者的著作，那又羣起而捧之了。批評者不但工作乏善可陳，而其居心和人格，也就成了間題。批評者沒有盡他的責職，我們應予以譴責！</p>
<p>然而批評者應受這個譴責麼？我雖不是一個批評者，却可以描繪出他們受了寃屈的苦悶來。</p>
<p>首先，在現在，批評者無處可以發表他的批評。一般的文化都在低落，出版界已到了有延殘喘的地步，所出版的，如果不是爲了政治的宣傳，就爲了經濟的利潤，誰還有篇幅來給你發表批評。同時，也就因爲出版界的貧薄，脆弱，看來也就沒有什麼作品是値得一評的，或經得起一聲的。英雄到了無用武之地，於英雄何尤？批評者不能不有其苦悶，也就不應不有其原諒。</p>
<p>次之，批評者不能發表其正確的批評。這種批評，尤其關於指摘的，發表不出。如果編者或作者請你寫批評的，你就只好頌揚，不再指摘，有時甚至要你作過度的，遠過勝於事實的頌揚。你要指摘，編者總怕兼負駡人之職，他總要和你婉商，修正爲妙，修正之不已，使你面目全非，失去原來的意義。</p>
<p>最後，批評者也不發處表其正確的批評。這也是關於指摘的，如果你對於一個生性惡劣的作者，輕輕的指摘了一下，那就會速得你家要的鷄犬都不寗，天下從此多事起來。他會爲自己辯護，强詞奪理，曉曉不休，使你感到頭痛。但這還算是好的，尤甚者，他就攻擊你，攻擊你的作品之外，更攻擊你的個人。攻擊你時，他全文擇詞，不擇事，不擇任何手段，似乎非食你的肉，寢你的皮不可。明的攻擊不着，還有暗的；一時的攻擊不着，更有長期的，大有生生死死，與你結仇到底，非將你殲滅不可！而對於他自己的作品如何，早就置之度外，不予過問了。這種批評的後果，試問那一個批評者吃得消！可是這種後果却是時常會隨你的批評而來，你一想到這個，你還有姐子來舞文弄墨，實行正確的批評，將自己陷入泥塗麼？</p>
<p>批評者，如果是一個有資格的批評者，正願意盡其批評的才能，來爲學術與文化努力，有如我們每一個知識份子所期望的那樣做。然而他是可能的麼？尤其在現在？他旣不可能，他已感到苦悶；他還要爲了不任其咎的不可能，而覺到譴責，那他的苦悶還不大麼？</p>
<p>別人的苦悶，還可以歸咎於環境，只要環境改良了，他們的苦悶也就解除了。獨有批評者的苦悶，却不是環境改良了所能完全解除的。因爲他的苦悶的首項是關於環境的，只要文化發達，出版旺盛，就可以順利地解除，而第二三項，尤其第三項，則在不論什麼環境中，都會發生，個直無法可以使之不發生。因此，照我看來，一個批評者命定是一個苦悶者，其苦悶還在作者與編者之上。</p>
<p>「吃力不討好」，正是這種是非分明的批評者的正確寫照。</p>
<p>還有些創作者，也會學着柴霍甫的論調說：「批評者是創作者的寄生虫」，即他，批評者，眞就到了永世不得超升的地步，又豈但苦悶而已！</p>
<h3>教育社會學</h3>
<p>— 張永曾</p>
<p>著者：陳科美</p>
<p>出版期：三十四年五月</p>
<p>出版處：世界書局</p>
<p>這是一本泛論敎育社會學的書，將關於這方面的各家學說和各種研究資料加以綜合，衍義雖不甚高而能得其要領，使讀者可以從本書中獲得淸晰的概念。此外又將敎育社會學的歷史背景和研究方法擇要介紹，使我們能把握住敎育社會學探討的核心。</p>
<p>全書共分十講。第一講：說明敎育社會學的發展之重要，敎育和社會關係的密切，以及輓近社會學進步的原因。</p>
<p>第二講：介紹敎育社會學上兩個主要的學派，一爲敎育學派，祖師是蘇則羅博士，一爲社會學派，代表是愛爾烏德和芬雷二敎授。</p>
<p>第三講：概述敎育社會學的內容和範圍。</p>
<p>第四講及第五講：叙說敎育和社會的關係。對於敎育和社會組織，社會制裁，社會遗傳，社會進步的關係也分述得極爲詳盡</p>
<p>第六講：討論社曾原理的重要性，並提出了敎育和民主主義，社會效率，文化概念三大原理相互聯藥及應用，作者强調要實現民主的，效率的，和文化的社會生活必須要依據此三種社會原理。</p>
<p>第七講：講述敎育調查。這種科學方法是敎育實施的起點和根據，又是實施的終點和證騐。它的貢獻是指導敎育者產生改進學校的情緒，使敎育行政學術化，實際化。</p>
<p>第八講：將學校行政分成兩方面來說，一是外部的，包括公衆和學校。一是內部的，分述行政人員的責任，訓練，資格和學校行政的特性。</p>
<p>最後兩講叙逆課程研究的要點，敎育的目標以及敎導的方法，並指出了過去一般人在敎導上的錯誤。</p>
<p>讀完這本書後，使我發生了一些感想。敎育和社會的關係是如此的密切，肚會化敎育不發　，則社會必不會進步，面目前中國社會的混亂，敎育的落伍，文盲在全人口中百分比之高，國民基礎敎育都距離理想尙達，遺詼得上什麼敎育的社會化？</p>
<p>我以爲要挽回中國敎育的厄連，必須改革目前學校傳統的形式敎育，除去學校及社曾間的隔　，實行民主主義的敎育，普及敎育於整個社會，使敎育的機會究全均等。一方面適應社會需要，一方面適應個性差異。這樣，敎育便可以成爲改造社會的動力，而平等的，自由的，進步的，合理的社會，又可促成敎育的　續的發展。</p>
<h3>海南島地理</h3>
<p>— 魯元</p>
<p>陳正祥著　正中書局版</p>
<p>海南島爲我國第二大島，面積略小於台灣，與台灣隔海遙遙相對，如果說台灣是我國東太平洋的屏障，那末海南島就是南太平洋的前哨了。抗戰勝利以後，國人目力均移注於日本代爲開闢的台灣，專門論著很多，但對於海南島的重要，都被忽視了，而專門的論著却非常地少。政府最近雖在海南島另設一省行政署，以謀該地發展，然國內人士少右前去開拓，蓋實由於國人未能熟悉該島地理情形，陳著「海南島地理」一書，可以說是將海南島在國人面前加以剖析。</p>
<p>海南島在地理環境上，較之台灣無有不及之處，但台灣經過日人的努力經營，已經成爲實業發達經濟繁榮的地方，而海南島仍處於原始狀態中，作者特在太書中有警惕性地提出原因，對於該島地理環境逐一予以詳細討論，並且將該島與台濺在數字上作一正確的比較，標明海南島的開發希望是很大，這並不是作者憑空杜撰的。</p>
<p>全書分十四章，約六萬餘字，先將該島地理作一概括的論述，再就地形氣候居民物產工業貿易交通都市等以次分章，加以分析與討論，使讀者能一目暸然。最後附章中，作者提出海南島附近之南海三羣島，已爲外邦所覬覦，尤能促起國人注意。</p>
<h3>直綫圖形</h3>
<p>— 中直</p>
<p>許多初學幾何的朋友，來問我，有什麼好的參考書？我總是介紹他們到商務去買一本直线圖形來看看。許多朋友看過了這本書，雖然不誇獎這本書好，却能自然而然的，對幾何發生很大的與　，我之所以集于介紹這本書，其原因也就在此。</p>
<p>林結一是位日本數學家，不但在日本有很高的地位，即　全世界，也有不小的聲；這一本書，充滿了日本氣息。</p>
<p>實先言先生”在　內數學界也還有　望　著都很可觀，所譯直　　　一書，相當流利，也何存　　風　。</p>
<p>直线圖，是幾何學中最簡單的一部份，但是極其重要。也相當有趣。這本書裏面很詳細的把直线圖形的性質，介紹給讀者，把讀者的基脚，打得十分牢固。有了良好的根舊，再學圓及面積等等，自然能得心應手，樂趣盎然了。</p>
<p>該聲的內容十分平常，而！制却十分奇特，—就是我所謂的—日本氣息。</p>
<p>書中，例題很我差不多的直綫定理，都網　在內，書來又有解法指針，很能激發人的思慮力，引起人的研究心。每個定理之後，附有用法，對於我國學生，尤有裨益。</p>
<p>至於本書於學衛上的實歡，也有一點，就是「三角形兩腰之中點聯綫，平行於底邊，且等於底邊之半」，一定理之應用，使許多難題獲得了便利的解法。</p>
<p>我敢大胆的說！「若能詳細的將該書看一遍，必定能使你對幾何發生莫大的興趣！」（書係林鶴一著商務版）</p>
<h3>從叔本華到尼采</h3>
<p>— 上官美博</p>
<p>陳銓著　大東書局出版</p>
<p>本書在去年十一月由大東書局出版，書的名稱雖為「從叔本華到尼采」，內容却完全是講尼采的，叔本華則使在叙述尼采初期思想時附帶論及。作者陳銓爲我國研究德國哲學和德國文學有數學者來介紹這位偉大的德國思想家，大概不容易找出更適宜的人了罷。</p>
<p>尼采的哲學，在我國早有不少人介紹過，尼采本人的著作也有很多譯到中文來了。不幸的是時至今日，尼采在我國還是最被人誤解的思想家。很有些知識份子把他看做法西斯的老租宗，以爲他的哲學就是法西斯主義理論的藍本，這實在是令人十分惋惜的錯誤。尼采哲學與法西斯主義在外表上雖有不少相似的地方，在本質上却完全是兩回事。「超人」一辭在尼采的本意原只是一個生命力磅礴的創造者的象徵，在窮兵　武的法西斯主義者手中，却一燮而爲殺人放火的破壞者了。</p>
<p>這次大戰前夕，墨索里尼和希特勒確曾以熱情如狂的尼采式“吻，謳歌戰爭，讚美侵略，先後在非洲和歐洲放起燎原的野火，意圖實現其超人帝國的迷夢，終乃造成西歐各國今日慘烈的破壞與混亂。世人飽經戰災之餘，痛定思痛，一致起而非難尼采，把這次浩刧的責任歸罪於超人哲學一若超人哲學就是導致這次戰禍的誘因，這種不相干的誤解豈是尼采創超人哲學時始料之所及者？尼采地下有知能不爲之痛心</p>
<p>我們現在如果想分析這種誤解的原因，當然願意知道尼釆之究竟。尼采的文字富於象徵性與一抒情性，要認識他的眞意本不容一易，過去介紹尼采的書雖多，但一眞能透過他的象徵性抒情性的藝術氛圍而闡明他的眞義的，可以說沒有。現在陳銓先生這本介紹尼采的書却把這件困難的工作做成功了，我希望誤解尼采的人都能一讀此書。讀過這本書的人並不一定完全贊同尼采，信仰尼采，却可以不致誤解尼采，這是我敢斷言的。</p>
<p>本書分上下二編，上編講尼采思想的形成與發展，詳述尼采由贊成叔本華轉變到反對叔本華的經過。其間論華格納的音樂給予尼釆的神秘的啓示之處，頗具獨到精闢之見地，極有一讀的價値。下編介紹尼采哲學的體系，將尼采思想就政治，宗敎道德戀愛等方面，一一加以系統的解說，使讀者對尼采思想得詳細的，淸晰的了解。特別値得稱道的，是本書並非單純介紹性質，而是一本半創作性的著作，作者不時以自己的見解發揮尼采哲學的精義。雖然有些地方似乎還有待商榷和討論，如作者謂尼采晚年倡「權力意志」之說又回復到他早年的希臘悲劇思想等處，我的意見就與作者不盡相同了。但在尼采普遍誤解的今天，能有這樣一本書出現，總是値得慶幸的事情，特以欣慰的心情向各位推薦這本難得的好書。至於全書叙述生動，文字優美尤其餘事。</p>

<h3>尼采傳</h3>
<p>— 石碚</p>
<p>（佚名著　讀者之友社刊行　三十五年初版）</p>
<p>孫伏園著「魯迅與尼彩學說」中，曾提到魯迅先生對尼彩的「蘇魯支語錄」說：「文字的剛勁，讀起來有金石聲。而他的學說的精髓，則在鼓勵人類的生活，思想，文化，日漸向上，不使停頓在瑣層的，卑鄙的，只江意於物質的生活之中。」這幾句話，不僅是對尼彩的學說，甚至對尼彩的爲人，都是批評得非常透切而深知的。遠在一八六九年，尼彩在巴賽爾大學執敎時，他的同事蒲爾克嚇德曾說：「稱尼彩爲學者，不如稱為藝術家。」這個評语，正是與魯迅先生的話，恰成互爲呼應。</p>
<p>本書的作者就是採取還樣的角度去看尼彩的。他說，「尼彩的一生不是一個平庸的人的生和死，那是一個藝術作品，一個悲劇！去了解尼彩的作品和了解他的『人』，其間沒有任何必須持有的差別，同時也只有從藝術的角度上去看尼彩。……」仇在本書後記中，寫下了一個相當有趣又意味深長的比喩；「據說「鶴頂紅」是一種毒藥，封建時代愚頑地中於皇帝的臣子常舐此以自殺的，我不知道這粳植物的毒性倒底怎樣，但從畫像上所看到的，却是血紅紅的那末一大點，我實在歡喜那樣地紅，我非常酷愛着這種紅，因此我想毒的東西也自有其美麗處，『鶴頂紅』可以藥殺人，但『紅』却給了我們美麗的刺激。」尼彩的超人哲學就像這「鶴頂紅」般。</p>
<p>今天，我們活在動蕩不安的和極權勢力又復抬頭的時代，對尼彩應該有一個較正確的進步的認識，我覺得是頗爲必要的。第二次世界大戰期間，希特拉的獷悍暴戾便是以尼彩的超人哲學爲法西斯思想的根源。在本月中旬，我偶然在一份英文報上讀到關於法西斯的勢力還潛伏在歡洲各國，和在阿根廷大肆活動的消息。由這些報道，我們可知道希魔雖已慘敗了，然其餘患尙存，且有重整旗鼓的趨勢；在這樣的日子，我們對被捧作法西斯「祖宗」的尼彩，更應有一個新的估計。「尼彩傳」便是給我們對尼彩有一個認識和警惕的傳記。作者對尼彩的思想有長期的研究，激起他寫這本傳記的動機的是因爲談了尼彩的「蘇魯支語錄」和克魯泡特金的「互助論」而來。</p>
<p>全書共分十二章：一，「小牧師」——基督敎之子；二，面對着叔本華的鏡子；三，靑年敎授；四，「悲劇之產生」；五，和瓦格納的友誼；六，愛和女人；七，創作，創作；八，遺棄了叔本筆；九，一個無神論者？十，超人，超人；十一，他瘋了；十二，悲劇的完成；後記。每章的叙述都是很雋永流麗的，以具有豐富文藝情趣的彩筆，刻劃了尼彩的一生和其思想的深層；用冷靜的藝術家的態度，守着純客觀的理智的立塲；揚善貶惡，敢說敢言，這是傳記文學最基本而重要的精神，本書是已經做到這一點了。</p>
<p>尼彩的父親是一個虔敬的基督新敎牧師，母親是一個牧師的女兒，所以他是在一個充滿着宗敎氣氛的家庭裏成長的。幼年時期受他雙親的影饗很深，父親在忠實於敎義的宣導外，尙酷愛詩和音樂，對愛默生（R.W　etnerson）特別尊崇，愛氏的作品經常放置在案頭和手邊。愛氏的沉厚誠摯的筆調，透入尼彩父親的靈魂中。尼彩的母親，美而健康，生機勃勃，尼彩所崇揚的生命力，可說是在他母親的身上得到。但尼彩不及二歲，他的父親便辭世了。這時搬了一次家，母親變得沉鬱寡言，後來尼彩變得沉獻寡言，或許是全受此影響。小孩子的時候，他幾乎終日不大做聲，劇烈的競技式的遊戲他都不參加，一個人靜悄俏地默想着些什麼。稍長大，進了學校，在校中是一個好學生，品性十分優良，但不慣和同學在一起玩；他愛詩和音樂，整天把自已關在孤獨的房子裏，這種個性的養成，成了他年長時的孤獨癖。一生孤獨，一生沉思默想，最後竟至氣狂而死。</p>
<p>尼彩的全部思想，可說是集矛盾於一身的：從寫信叔本華至反對叔本華；從否定人生至肯定人生；從希臘主義至羅馬主義；從熱愛女性至痛駡女性；從狂戀人生至盲信人生；終至走上極端的「趙人」哲學上。這是達到了他思想的最高峰，可是他之所以豎起這樣不顧一切的超拔的學說，完全是因極力反對叔本華的厭世悲觀論所造成。他和叔本華不同的地方，他是用「工作」，用「奮鬥」來作爲人生的準繩；叔本華則主張「厭世」，「忘我」；他們同樣的都承認人生痛苦，但一個提倡忘我地去漢視痛苦，一個則認爲應該正視痛苦而以奮鬥和工作去克服痛苦，前者是叔本華，後者是尼彩。</p>
<p>至於希特拉怎樣去利用了尼彩呢？這是因爲尼彩是歌頌爭戰的，認爲戰爭對於一個衰老的民族是一帖良　，他把民族的衰老比做是個人患着的肺病，他需要一稱殘酷利害的葉去醫治，這藥就是戰爭。於是戰爭也就成了超人哲學中的一部分，爲希特拉所沉醉，成了殘殺人類的罪魁。不過，若尼彩死而有知，或許他也要痛責希魔的猖獗吧？因爲尼彩曾經說這樣的話：「每一個人都要由他自己，看　別人的理理。」所以尼彩並不一定是一個徵頭徹尾的嚕戰者，他這句話是値得我們體味的。</p>
<p>總之徙歷史的敎調上，我們已確定了人類生存的最基本的條件是　情與互助的必然之存在，這是　獲不駛用之萬世的眞理，故尼　的尋被我們揚棄了。現在讓我們再從另一方面去看尼彩。一八七五年，尼彩三十歲以後，他的健康打了很大的折扣，病弱和身心孤苦痛楚自此開始，一直到迫近瘋在和死亡（死年五十六歲）。但是他還緊握着筆，寫出他深選的思想，那堅强不撓的意志，便他躺在病床上還是想，還是創作，人生的然愛和精神的永燃之火使他不死。從這一情景裏我們看尼彩，我們將看到無限的生命力，使我們自己卑　萎縮餒氣的靈魂獲得振奮，增强了生的勇氣！這就是前面魯迅和蒲爾克嚇　對尼彩評價的主要精神之所在。當我很鄙夷尼彩的學說時，而這一點精神，奮發的鋒銳，是否是値得我們學習和效仿，我想讀者是會明白的。</p>
<p>最後讓我引文藹理士的話，作爲本文的結束：「僅若我們回過頭來看十九世紀末三十年前後，就可以知道那時代的思潮完全給兩位意識和理想全然相反的人所支配：托爾斯泰和尼彩。托爾斯泰代表基督敎底社會共通底和人道主義底理想，比基督敎義還要過分些。尼彩代表唯理主義底異端底和個人主義底理想，和普通唯理主養比較，也有過分的地方。他們都是以自己的方法完成了自己的藝術家，敏銳的心理學家，在生活途徑上奮鬥着的前進者，超然捨己，辛苦地向探求着什麼的工作者。」</p>
<p>這些話，可設是中肯的，我希望大家以　靜的眼光去讀尼彩傳</p>

<h3>「鐵錨」回來了！</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>甲午中日海戰（一八九四年），看稱中顫的北洋海軍，在黃海及威海衛之役，打了二次全軍覆沒的敗仗。</p>
<p>而其中我遠東最大的旗艦「鎭遠」號被日本俘膚，鎭遠艦上爾隻大鐵錨，一直陳列於東京日比野公園，作爲日本甲左戰爭的戰勝紀念品。</p>
<p>而其他被擊沉被砲毀於二次海戰中的軍艦，尙未計算在內。</p>
<p>被人塗上「羞辱」的記號，陳列在日本的「鐵錨」已整整四十三年，而現在，「鐵錨」得以「凱旋」回返祖國，身爲華　子孫，那得不衷心慶幸！</p>
<p>但在歷史意義上，甲午戰爭之敗，可以淸室的腐庸昏憤說明他必敗的理由。</p>
<p>當時的海　，所以一敗塗地　，不是沒有理由的。所謂北洋艦隊，不單噸數，連力，　砲的　力遠不及日本，而海軍士卒平日極少訓練，一　臨陣，怎慶不全軍覆滅？</p>
<p>相傳慈稽太后會挪挪一大筆公　，添　頤和園，慶祝她自己的壽辰，而對於訓練海軍經費，却置之度外，以如此一個沒有主見，沒有眼光的慈禧主持大政，怎麼不呌日本人肆無忌惲，而佔期鮮，割遼東半島，奪取台灣，澎湖，續攻大連，再陷旅順！使中國歷史，　上一道最可恥的血痕。</p>
<p>而現在，這飽經風霜滿身破爛的「鐵　」，却帶着勝利的光輝回返到祖國來，她給予我們的敎訓，都是値得我們深思的。</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦側寫</h3>
<p>— 溥倫</p>
<p>編者按：巴勒斯坦始終成爲一紛爭喧嚷的土地，猶太人與阿刺伯人，一直無法解決他們各自的偏見。最近有人向巴勒斯坦調查團提出，請英軍退出巴勒斯坦，由猶太人與阿刺伯人合組一民主國家。現在讓我們簡略地介紹一下這個世界的「聖地」，讓大家有一個簡明的綸廓。</p>
<p>當一個現代的旅行者遊到巴勒斯坦這塊古地的時候，聖經中所記載的遺跡，便很生動地一頁一頁展開在他的眼前。在他所遊歷到的每一個角落，這些遺跡，已隨年代而褪色了。他會發現那在時間上失掉了名字如希勃倫（Hebron）而深感驚奇，因爲那地方就是大衛王所統轄的城池；同樣地，他亦會很驚奇地發現耶穌誕生在馬槽裏的伯利恒城（Bethehem）。還有，在耶利哥地方，城牆己敗壞不堪了。而在這些地方，人們就生活在石屋裏或磚瓦室中，得以保衛他們的子孫，地們用粗糙的工具工作着，一代傳過一代，吃着發酵和未曾發酵的麵包，而且死了。</p>
<p>當希伯萊的先知，耶穌基督和他的十二個門徒，初訂世界偉大的宗敎戒律以後，這聖地很少有變化了。雖然時間已有這麼長久。從波尼西亞（Phoenizia）,（即現在的黎巴嫩）到埃及，以及從地中海到死海和約但河，周圍面積共有一萬方哩，等於馬利蘭（Maryland）一樣大。論地形輪廓，可以分爲三部份：海濱平原，這平原是和海平行的，包括着古庇利士蒂亞（Philistia）和沙龍（Sharon），是中東產糧最豐富之區。中部是多山地帶，這地區包括着有歷史中心，如伯利恒，希勃倫和耶路撒冷。另有一部份，是死海和的但河。雖然巴勒斯坦有一大片沙漢，但一直到現在，由於善於經營，大部份已成爲富裕的地方了。</p>
<p>起初，古希伯萊人是一個遊牧民族。他們生存在「毛屋中」，就是靠羊毛保衛的意思。使徒保羅是個最著名宣揚聖經的。他的故鄉，塔穌斯（Tarsus），仍留有穿羊毛衫的風尙；因爲保羅小時就學會了織羊毛。聖地的好幾個城池，迄今完整如故。在聖經中的其他地方，考古學家還沒有發現，但依然繼續地發掘，那些已發現的城池，每一個六至十英畝的地方，已被建爲堅固的防禦物了。每一個城池的郊外，都有幾個附屬小市鎭。居於低地的人民，即如舊約中所記載的住在泥潭的磚屋裏，而過着耐勞刻苦的生活。居於高地者住在石　，生活比較過得去。</p>
<p>聖經的巴勒斯坦的故事，滲透着相沿的習俗，和混雜　傳奇和事蹟。當猶太民族始祖亞伯拉罕（Abraham）帶他的民族離開靠近波斯灣的查次第士的由爾（nr）時起，到耶穌時止，這一段時間，巴動斯坦是羅馬一個繁華省份；而現在，年代已經跨過了兩千年了。但巴勒斯坦却轉換不少統治者：埃及人，叙利亞人，巴比倫人，亞斯利亞人和羅馬人。到了十七世紀的巴勒斯坦，亞刺伯人就佔最多的數目。每個統治者一到這地方就焚燒廟宇，並且帶來自己的宗敎和文化。</p>
<p>但綠色的山嶺，依然遺留在這聖經的歷史之地。</p>
<h3>實行高中分科制度</h3>
<p>— 楊平章</p>
<p>爲了無數中學生的前途，和他們寳貴的光陰，我不禁喊出這這號——實行高中分科制度——爲他們請命。</p>
<p>照現在一般人民的經濟能力看，大多數是中學畢業後，便準備就業，能進大學的並不多，然而一般中學畢業生，走出了校門，却找不到適當的工作；原因當然很多，主要的，却是他們在學校裏所得到的學識，和現實的社會格格不入；換句話設，就是學校的功課，和社會的需要不能合理地配合起來。</p>
<p>我以爲在六年的小學敎育中，普通通的智識已有一點了，再加上三年初中敎育，又求得比較高深一點的普通學識；因此，在高中實在可以進入專門的途徑，那就是分科，使他們依性之所近，選擇一科專修。讓他們能專心自己選擇的功課。如此，不但不必强令學生讀他們不愛好的科目，並且還能縮短學習的過程，譬如將來想在文學方面有所成就的，似乎不必讀太多的數理；預備學電機工程的，也可以把大部分時間，放在和該科目有關的數理上。在學習的過程，但求懂得十分透澈，沒有一些合糊。如果在這三年中，用心學習，成績一定大有可觀的。</p>
<p>這是一個相當嚴京的敎育問題，尤其是我國正需要靑年的現在，不合理的敎育制度，我們要加以改英才對。祈望關心敎育的人仕，特別加以注意，多多發表意見，使舊的中學制度走上新的戰道！</p>

<h3>新疆的政治變遷</h3>
<p>— 肇基</p>
<p>新疆在明末淸初時分爲天山南路，天山北路二區，天山北路又分爲和碩特，準噶爾，杜爾伯特，土爾扈特四部，中以準噶　部爲最强，淸康熙十二年，準噶爾汗，噶爾丹，征服和碩特部，統一厄魯特部，據天山北路大部，噶爾丹死後，他兄子策妄阿拉布坦繼位投降淸廷，但準噶爾部反覆無常，每每發兵侵略他部，但總爲淸廷所平定。以後準部雖然衰落了，但是杜爾伯特的屬部輝特部崛起，佔據天山北路全部，淸高宗令兆惠率兵進討，統一天山北路，淸廷於是派兵進駐伊犂，烏魯木齊，塔爾巴哈臺三地，并且以伊犂將軍統治。</p>
<p>天山南路素來為回族所佔據，淸初南路之回敎分爲白山宗，黑山宗二派，二派勢不兩立，互相頭　，這時準噶　汗爲噶爾丹，他帮白山宗，滅去黑山　，並且以準噹爾人統治其地，但是到策妄爲準部　長時，又排斥白山宗而代以黑山宗，還捕去白山宗首領　罕木二子大和卓木，小和卓木，後輝特部　阿睦撒納，因要想得到四部的援腘，就釋放了大和卓不，還借兵給他，便古定天山南路。乾隆二十二年，清兵平　特部，於是大小和卓木就在喀什　爾獨立，清　兆　富德進剿</p>
<p>同治元年大山南路回民叛亂，回酋張格爾子和卓布蘇格，引蒙古之浩罕兵入寇，浩罕將阿古柏帕夏佔有天山南北路，這時帕夏聲勢甚盛淸臣中竟有人提義放棄天山南北路，左宗棠堅持不可放棄，在光緒元年左宗棠率兵征討，到光緒四年始平定，光緒八年將天山南北路併爲一新疆省。</p>
<h3>文天祥就義</h3>
<p>— 季明</p>
<p>太史公曰：「勇者不必死節，匹夫慕義，何處不勉焉。」設曼山亦曰：「慷慨赴死易，從容就義難。」故知文天祥盡節燕京，較古今忠臣烈士尤難一着，何者？蓋天祥受刑時，南宋亡國已久，元相伯顏說之曰：「刻天下已歸本朝，海內安堵，人心忘宋，公縱從容就義，恐後世未必知道。」少帝亦勸之曰：「公忠心於宋，天下盡知，然國運不可挽回，曷不委心北面，共圖富貴？」爲天祥者，此時一念之憂，即可爲貳臣之續，然卒能努力壓制，克成正果，實賴「正氣」二字有以致之。</p>
<p>元史載，天祥就刑日，燕京風沙蔽天，咫尺不見，後於衣帶中得其遺東，曰：「孔曰成仁，孟曰取義，惟其義畫，所以仁至讀聖賢書，所學何事？而今而後，庶幾無愧。」三十二字，至今溧澟有生氣，當時學士王磐（宋養元仕元者）作詩哭之曰：「大元不殺文丞相，君義臣忠兩得之，義似漢王封齒日，忠如蜀將斬顏時。×××××××，×××××××，只恐史臣編不到，老夫和淚寫新詩。」王本係貳臣，目睹天祥之死，亦不能無感，足見公道自在人心，固不論歷史是否編得到也。</p>

<h3>旅美什錦</h3>
<p>— 徐菽</p>
<p>美國的廣播事業</p>
<p>在美國，廣播已成爲一種敎育性而兼商業性的大企　，廣播事業是與無綫電收音俱來的。美國的廣播公司，很多是播送二十四小時，平均每個市鎭有三家到四家廣播公司在播音，所以一架五燈收音機至少可收聽百多個站，這是全憑週率而定的。我住在德士省時，可以收聽芝加哥·舊金山。洛杉磯等地，但收聽不到紐約和華盛頓的節目，由舊金山轉播的中國和倫教節目一樣可以收聽，美國播音節目上午以宗敎及時事爲多，下午時事及唱片，到了晚上便是特別節目了，有得煙公司的歌唱節目，有好來塢明星的滑稽，其中女明星Ann　Southern，男明星Bob　Hope等相聲尤爲精采。幾手可以說是」字一笑，有時眞能使你笑痛肚皮。劇詞都是有專家預先編就，當塲宣讀而已，也有把小說搬上廣播電台的。好萊塢有不少影片的劇本，是由廣播電台的劇詞蛻化而來的；體育消息也擁有大量聽衆，因爲美國人賽球角刀都在晚上，在體育塲搭起臨時廣播電台。美國大學也有不少設立廣播講座的，由這一點可以看出美國廣播事業的所以發達和不落於下流，廣播員大都爲受有特殊訓練的專家，譬如說時事評述，總由國際問題專家担任，許多報館的社評家被廣播公司羅致去担任廣播工作，大學裏的廣播講座，除有專家正音及敎授門檻外，還得且備播音器全套。每個學生都得實地練　，而敎授及同學就成爲他的聽衆。電影明星視播播爲生財大道，因爲拍電影的酬勞，是以每片或每週計的，廣播公司是以每塲計的，而且所費時間甚短，不過一刻鐘光景，在銀幕上沒有像收音機中那麼親切有味，廣播有把聽衆吸引成爲電影聽衆的力量，所以電影明星往往利用廣播來自我宣傳，大家都承認Bob　Hope根本不會演戲，祗會胡鬧，可以他有大量的觀衆，實際則是他的無綫電聽衆。中國各大學應速設廣播講座，造就上流廣播人才，則無綫電中不致有「觸那」等名詞矣。（二十一）</p>
<p>科學小品</p>
<h3>曇花　（下）</h3>
<p>— 賈祖璋</p>
<p>我們對於曇雲化所以感到興趣，是因爲大家知道那一句「曇花一現」的成語。曇花是一個簡稱，牠的全名呌做優曇缽華或優曇華，見於法華經：「佛吿舍利弗，如是妙法，如優曇缽華，時一現耳。」這所謂「一現」，不僅指牠開花的時間極短，還指牠難得開花，「時一現耳」，便是「偶然開一回花」的意思。所以南史說：「優曇華乃佛瑞應，三千年一現，現則金輪出世。」</p>
<p>法華經沒有設明曇花的形態，牠究竟是怎樣一種植物，不容易考查。依據一統志所說：「優曇鉢出肇慶府，　　琶，無花而實」，那末是屬於無花果ｇ　類的。辭源便依據這一說：云；「優曇華梵語花名，亦名優曇鉢華，爲無花果類。產於喜馬拉耶山麓及德干高原，錫蘭等處，幹高丈餘，葉有一一種，一平滑，一粗糙，皆長四五寸，端尖。雌雄異花，甚細，隱于　狀凹陷之花托中。……花托大如拳，或如拇指，十餘葉生，可食而味劣。」這一說假如確實，那末曇花也是年年開花的，祗因爲牠是　頭花序，古代的印度人便無從觀察到了。　又據梁書波斯國傳云：「臘中有優鉢曇花，鮮華可愛。」那是一種花朵美麗的植物，與一統云所說，完全不同。雲南志便依據這一說，云：「優曇花在安寗州西北十里曹溪寺石，狀如蓮，有十二瓣，閏月則多一，色白氣香，種來西域，亦娑羅花類也。後因兵燹伐去，遂無其種。今忽一枝從根旁發出，己及拱矣。」同書另有和山花，娑羅花兩則記　，似指同一種植物：</p>
<p>「和山花樹高六七丈，其質似桂，其花白，每朶十二瓣，應十二月，遇閏輒多一瓣。俗以爲仙人遺種，在大理府上關和山之麓，土人因以其地名之。」</p>
<p>「娑羅花在會城土主廟，其本類大理府和山花。佛日盛開，其色白，微帶黃意。異香芳　，非同凡花臭味。中出一蕊，如稗穗，垂出辦中，每朶十二辮，遇　輒多一瓣。相傳高憎以二念珠入土，一珠出此樹云。」從這三則文字考祭起來，那是一種王蘭科植物。目本人曾以北美原產的洋玉蘭當作優釁華，却是錯誤的。因爲牠應該是中國或印度原產的植物。</p>
<p>還有一說，以為　花又呌優　羅花，大概是譯音的不同。岑參有優缽羅花歌，說明了牠的產地和形態，但是另指一種草本櫃物了：「參嘗談佛經，聞有優缽羅花，目所未見。天寳庚申歲，參忝大理評事攝監察御史，領伊西北庭度支副使。自公多暇，乃於府庭內栽樹種藥，爲山　池，婆娑乎其間，足以寄傲交河。小吏有獻此花者，云得之於天山之南，其狀異於衆草，勢龍從如冠弁，　然上聳，生不旁引，攢花中折，駢葉外包，異香騰風，秀色媽景。……綠莖碧葉好顏色，□葉六瓣花九房，夜掩早開多異香。」淸代吳長元所撰的宸垣識略，也說到優　羅，云：一開必四月八日，至冬結實，如鬼建蓬，脫去其衣，酷類金色佛像。禮儀制司舊有此花，今無。」這是依據「金綸出世」，「佛日盛開」等設意造而成的，極不可靠。</p>
<p>綜合以上這些舊記載，有三類植物都可以稱爲曇花，一是無花果一類的，一是玉蘭一類的，一是一種不知類似何種櫃物的草花。但這三類植物都不是現在所見的仙人靠科植物。認現在所見的這種櫃物爲曇花，尙未有舊的記載可以稽考，想必是極近代的事緣故。</p>
<p>我們要考定曇花原本是什麼植物，最妥當的辦法，應該直接向印度去訪求。不知梵文學者，對於曇花見到過什麼較詳細的記載沒有？</p>

<h3>The Capital Prepares National Guest Treatment: Wedemeyer Departs with Experts; U.S. Embassy Claims Arrival in Beijing on the 20th</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th] According to official announcements today: General Wedemeyer and his entourage are scheduled to depart from here at 3:00 PM (Greenwich Mean Time) on the 16th via a special military aircraft. They will first go to Nanjing and are expected to arrive on the 22nd of this month. The journey will pass through San Francisco, Hawaii, and Guam. Wedemeyer's group will initially establish a temporary residence at the U.S. Embassy in Nanjing, and all subsequent activities will be determined during the inspection.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 16th] A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy announced tonight: Lieutenant General Wedemeyer is expected to arrive here around noon on the 20th and will reside at Ambassador Stuart's official residence.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Our government has prepared to invite experts to thoroughly study the current national situation, draft concrete and feasible aid-to-China measures, and submit them to Wedemeyer for his return to Washington for U.S. reference. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been in frequent contact with the U.S. Embassy in recent days, preparing for his arrival. Wedemeyer will receive national guest treatment like Willkie and Wallace, inspecting the National Government's honor guard upon disembarking. The U.S. Embassy has arranged Wedemeyer's residence at No. 5 Ninghai Road, and the experts accompanying him may be housed at No. 6 Yihe Road and the International Club. On the day after his arrival in Beijing, Wedemeyer will pay his respects to Chairman Chiang and visit Premier Zhang and Foreign Minister Wang. After staying for a few days to meet with those he wishes to confer with, he will depart for various problem areas to investigate the facts.</p>
<h3>China Obtains Peace Early: Beneficial for Sino-American Commerce</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 15th] Zhang Pingqun, our Consul General in New York, delivered a speech at the Rotary Club of New York City today, urging American friends to change their traditional view of China as a remote country. Zhang stated that due to the close friendship between China and the United States, their cooperation during the recent war, and the development of modern transportation, China has become one of America's closest neighbors. A "bystander policy" is bound to fail, as friendship is not only a responsibility but also a privilege. A peaceful and prosperous China will undoubtedly benefit the United States. The sooner China obtains peace and restores order, the more beneficial Chinese commerce will become. We have a shared vested interest in establishing an orderly world to resolve the threat of totalitarian policies.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 15th] An editorial in the English-language "South China Morning Post" discusses Wedemeyer's visit to China, anticipating that China will eventually receive American aid. Wedemeyer may inherit the task relinquished by General Marshall and become the U.S. Special Envoy to China. The newspaper stated that Wedemeyer's mission is, in theory, to implement the Marshall Plan, rebuild war-torn areas, and promote the stability of the world economy. The newspaper believes that Wedemeyer's trip will have good results. The newspaper acknowledges that there are fundamental differences between Europe and Asia. However, the Marshall Plan is not superficially charitable but constructive. Therefore, when the Marshall Plan extends to Asia, China cannot be excluded.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jia'ao's Remarks in Tianjin: Efforts to Restore Northeast Lost to the Current; Serious Food Problem in North China, Urgent Solutions Sought</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 16th] Zhang Jia'ao left Tianjin by train at 4:00 PM on the 16th for Peiping and is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 19th. The trip to the Northeast has not yet been decided. It is reported that Zhang discussed matters concerning material institutions in Tianjin and Shanghai with Mayor Du before his departure. Zhang, in a meeting with reporters, first described the situation in the Northeast, stating: The restoration work of the past year since last May has now been destroyed again, and the manpower and resources spent have been lost to the current. He will go to Pan in the coming days to inspect the situation in the Northeast, study the required funds, and then seek restoration again. Regarding the relationship between the government's cessation of subsidy policies and the reduction in issuance, Zhang said: The figures accounted for by subsidies are actually not very large. Zhang's main purpose of this trip is to solve the food problem in North China, and he has conducted specific research on the required difference. According to reports: The sources of grain in Peiping and Tianjin are none other than the Ping-Sui, Ping-Han, Bei-Ning, and Jin-Pu routes. Currently, only the Ping-Sui route can still provide assistance. However, North China is experiencing famine, so the food panic is not only in the cities but has also spread to the countryside, making this problem even more urgent. The solutions are none other than domestic and foreign purchases. The harvest in the Yangtze River basin is very good, and it is hoped that a portion can be used to assist North China. However, the required coarse grains are produced very little in South China and will be purchased from abroad. Regarding the impending resumption of Sino-Japanese trade, Zhang stated: The export of Japanese goods must be aimed at obtaining U.S. dollars or pounds, and our country has appropriate controls over import and export trade. It is expected that after the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade, it will not have any impact on our country's market. Regarding the specialization of the Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank: It is said that currently, various loans are classified and separately lent by the Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, and are gradually moving towards specialization.</p>
<h3>Election Headquarters Passes Election Regulations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The Election Headquarters held its fourth committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the 16th, chaired by Zhang Lisheng. The cases discussed and passed included the following: (1) General Rules for Election Offices at All Levels and Election Committees; (2) Interpretation of whether "incumbent officials" listed in Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law and Article 8 of the National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law include central officials; (3) The list of candidates for election offices in various provinces and cities has been provisionally determined and submitted to the National Government for approval. The details are as follows: One. The General Rules for Election Committees stipulate that the committee will meet once every two weeks, and special meetings will be held when necessary. The matters decided by the Election Committee include: (1) The conduct of elections, important instructions to subordinate election units, and the nomination of committee candidates; (2) Matters related to elections; (3) Matters concerning the budget of each election office. Two. The "incumbent officials" referred to in Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law and Article 8 of the National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law should be subject to the restrictions of each article if they need to run for election. However, whether these officials include central officials, and whether the heads of various provincial departments are subject to the above restrictions throughout the province due to different responsibilities, various parties have repeatedly requested an interpretation. An explanation is proposed as follows: (1) The jurisdiction stipulated in Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law refers to the administrative region. The legislative intent is to prevent local officials from using their power to manipulate elections. Therefore, officials who should be restricted in the provincial government and its subordinate agencies, if they want to participate in the Legislative Yuan election within the province, should resign within the statutory period. As for the officials of various ministries and departments of the central government, their duty is to promote the central government's decrees, and all areas within the scope of sovereignty are within the scope of their promotion of decrees. There is no regional division of jurisdiction, and there is no direct relationship with local voters. It is difficult to have the possibility of using power to manipulate elections. Therefore, except for running for the Legislative Yuan in the electoral district where they are stationed, they should resign early and are not subject to the restrictions of the jurisdiction. (2) According to the above explanation, the departments and offices of each province are all governed by the province and should be equally restricted, regardless of their business.</p>
<h3>Deputy Ministers of the Central Propaganda Department</h3>
<p>Tao Xisheng and Li Junlong Appointed Internally</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] It is heard that the candidates for Deputy Ministers of the Central Propaganda Department have been internally determined to be Tao Xisheng and Li Junlong. Tao will also continue to serve as the chief editor of the Central Daily News.</p>
<h3>Peng Xuepei Arrives in Lanzhou</h3>

<h3>The Circumstances of Coking Expert Yu Zailin Being Killed by Communist Bandits: Dong Xian Guang Announces at a Reception</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinzhou, 16th] According to employees who fled from the Guanshan Mine Factory to Jinzhou when the Beipiao Coal Mine was lost, Yu Zailin, Director of the Engineering Department of the mine, was tragically killed when the Guanshan Mine Factory fell. Yang, a battalion commander of the bandit army, knew in advance that Yu was an engineering personnel with no weapons, but still brutally murdered him, and the bullets pierced his head. When Yu was shot, blood and flesh flew everywhere, and he fell into the mud. Afterwards, the bandit army strictly prohibited burial, resulting in the corpse being exposed for four days and nights before colleagues in the mine secretly buried him. At that time, the rain continued, and the body was washed out and devoured by wild men, leaving only a broken head, one hand, and two legs. The bones were scattered, which was extremely tragic. After the mine area was recovered, Yu's remains were transported from the mine to Jinzhou for burial. As of now, the personnel from the mine who were taken away by the Communist bandits have been identified as Zhang Qingchun, Director of the General Affairs Department, Xie Jiugao, Director of the Business Department, Ding Yaozhong, Director of the Staff Department, and Gu Zhengduan, Engineer Lu Zhao, and more than 20 others.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Director Dong Xianguang, during a press conference on the 16th, spoke about the circumstances of the Communist bandits killing the coking expert Yu Zailin, saying: Mr. Yu Zailin, Director of the Engineering Department of the Beipiao Coal Mine, was our country's coking expert. At the beginning of the month, the Beipiao Coal Mine was captured by Communist bandits, and Mr. Yu was tragically killed for protecting the mine's equipment. The whole country mourns and hates the cruelty of the Communist bandits, destroying talents, and carrying out their vicious attempt to sabotage nation-building. After the Soviet army withdrew from the Beipiao Coal Mine in January 35, it was recovered by the national army, and the Northeast Special Envoy's Office of the Ministry of Economy sent personnel to take over and reorganize the resumption of work. In May of the same year, it was again occupied by the Communist army. The substations of the Guanshan and Sanbao No. 2 mines affiliated to the Beipiao Coal Mine were bombed, and the Nanpiao Mine Factory was also severely damaged. In October 35, the National Resources Commission took over and actively increased production, with a daily output of more than 1,000 tons. The estimated output for 36 years was 500,000 tons for the whole year. In addition to being transported and sold to Shenyang and Jinzhou, part of it was exported from Huludao to Jinan, Qingdao, and Shanghai. However, the mine is located on the border of the Shuhua River and is often disturbed by Communist bandits, with almost no peaceful days. The mine workers still stood firm and continued production as usual. In mid-June of this year, the Communist army launched a large-scale invasion of the mine. On the 28th, the Taiji Mine Factory was captured, and they continued to attack the Guanshan Mine Factory. Although the mine's guard team and employees bravely resisted, they were outnumbered and completely lost on July 1. All the employees in the mine did not withdraw, and Mr. Yu died heroically. Mr. Yu was from Shengxian, Zhejiang, and was 39 years old. He graduated from the National Beiyang Institute of Technology in the 21st year of the Republic of China. He served as a technical officer and director of the Fuel Research Office of the Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute of the Ministry of Economy. In the 31st year, he was sent by the National Resources Commission to the United States to investigate the coal industry. After returning to China in the 34th year, he served as a coal industry consultant and director of the Tianfu Coal Mine Washing and Coking Plant in the Wartime Production Bureau of the Ministry of Economy. After the victory, he was sent to assist in the takeover of the Wushun Coal Mine. On New Year's Day of the 36th year, he joined the Beipiao Coal Mine as the Director of the Engineering Department. He left behind a wife and five children, and his situation after his death was quite bleak.</p>
<p>Questions and Answers with Reporters</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] Dong Xianguang answered questions at the press conference as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What is the current status of the Central News Agency and various party newspapers previously run by the Central Party Headquarters, and how will their future status be decided? To which department will these institutions belong, and what are their sources of funding?</p>
<p>Answer: Currently, all party newspapers have been organized into companies, implementing commercialization, recruiting commercial shares, and electing directors by shareholders, who are responsible for operations. The Central News Agency is also preparing for commercialization.</p>
<p>Question: Can you tell us the important cities that are currently under martial law?</p>
<p>Answer: Currently, the martial law in Shanghai has not been lifted. The war zone department has the right to declare martial law in emergency situations and then report to the central government.</p>
<p>Question: What is the public's response to total mobilization?</p>
<p>Answer: The government's determination to quell the Communist armed rebellion is quite popular with the people. This sentiment is fully reflected in the telegrams the government has received from all over the country, in the newspaper reports, and in the speeches of fair-minded public leaders and social elites. Now, generally, people have recognized that the Communists will not stop unless they fulfill their conspiracy to completely subvert the government and forcibly impose their way of life on the people of the whole country. The Communist Party's past participation in negotiations was only a conspiracy to delay time, intending to strengthen its combat power, seize more weapons and materials, and occupy more strategic locations. This has become an open secret. There is no hope of order, security, or justice in the areas occupied by the Communist army, which is known to all. No government in the world can coexist with armed traitors who rely on violence and use conspiracies and cruel means to carry out their evil policies.</p>
<p>Question: When will the Outline for the Implementation of Total Mobilization be announced?</p>
<p>Answer: The Outline for the Implementation of Total Mobilization must wait for the approval of the State Council and may be announced before the end of this week.</p>
<p>Question: After the implementation of total mobilization, how long will it take to eliminate the main force of the Communist army?</p>
<p>Answer: This is a question of a speculative nature. I believe that the length of time it takes to suppress the Communist army will depend on the degree to which mobilization is implemented.</p>
<h3>Liu Fengkai, Magistrate of Qingxian County, Hebei Province, and Others Tragically Killed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 16th] Liu Fengkai, Magistrate of Qingxian County, was captured when the Communist army suddenly entered Qingxian on June 14. It is learned that he was first escorted to Dacheng and Gao Po Village, where the pseudo Qingxian County Government was located, and then escorted back to Qingxian. On July 8, the Communist army held mass rallies for three consecutive days, parading Liu through the streets. Liu angrily scolded the Communist bandits for harming the country and the people. The Communist army once strangled Liu's mouth with a rope, causing his cheeks to swell. The public was moved to tears, and many Baojia chiefs jointly requested the Communist bandits to treat Liu leniently, but they were also severely beaten by the Communist bandits. Finally, on the 11th, Liu and Yang Pizhi, Chief Secretary of the Qingxian County Party Department, and Yang Wenbin, Chief of the Military Section of the County Government, were killed by the Communist bandits. Liu and others were stabbed to death by the Communist bandits with large knives on both sides of their ribs and legs, which was extremely tragic.</p>

<h3>Thirty-Five Soviet Overseas Chinese: Travel Procedures Do Not Comply</h3>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 15th] During the tense period in Changchun, 35 Soviet overseas Chinese came from Harbin, including 18 women.

<h3>Zhu Bangwei's Troops Achieve Success; Chairman Sends Telegram of Commendation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] Chairman Chiang commended Zhu Bangwei, Commander of the 54th Division of the 13th Army, for participating in the Battle of Sipingwei City and firmly defending the eastern front, laying the foundation for the victory of Siping. The telegram read: "This time, leading the army to defend Siping, your troops have shown outstanding loyalty and bravery, and your great achievements are gratifying.

<h3>Fierce Battle at Yantong Mountain, Jilin Province</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 16th] (1) The battle in the Yantong Mountain area is fierce. The Communist bandits have suffered almost complete casualties. About 500 reinforcements newly transferred from Panshi arrived yesterday afternoon. Currently, the national army is expanding the encirclement.

<h3>Security Situation in Guangdong Province Has Improved</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] According to a certain provincial committee member from Guangdong who came to Shanghai, the security situation in Guangdong has recently improved, but the Southern Route is still not peaceful. The number of Communist bandits on Hainan Island is difficult to determine, but there are no more than 3,000 guns. If there are sufficient military forces, it will not be difficult to suppress them in one fell swoop. Also, the existence of Hong Kong is closely related to the unrest in Guangdong Province, because Communist elements often use Hong Kong as their base, using money to buy off unemployed military officers and instigate the destruction of security in Guangdong Province. At the same time, ships from a certain country often drop weapons into Hong Kong's territorial waters, which are then salvaged by the Communist Party and smuggled into Guangdong, or transport large quantities of medicines to Hong Kong, exchange them for cash, and use them as funds for instigation. In the cultural and educational sectors, Communist Party activities are also extremely active, sometimes the funds used in one month are more than 80 times the propaganda expenses of the Guangdong Provincial Party Department.</p>
<h3>Draft Sino-British Air Transport Agreement Initially Approved by the Legislative Yuan: National Government Appoints Foreign Minister Wang to Negotiate with Full Authority</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The draft Sino-British Air Transport Agreement was initially reviewed and passed by the Foreign Affairs and Economic Committees of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 16th. However, whether to convene a special meeting of the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures, or to approve it first and then have the Legislative Yuan ratify it retroactively, has not yet been decided. The content of the Sino-British Air Transport Agreement is largely the same as the Sino-US Air Transport Agreement. The agreement is valid for a period of four years, during which either party may notify the other party at any time to terminate it one year later. Regarding routes, China and Britain each designate seven routes. However, considering that the Nanyang region is a gathering place for overseas Chinese, for the sake of economic development and to facilitate overseas Chinese, air transport will mainly focus on the Nanyang routes. China enjoys transport rights in the British territory in eight places: London, Prestwick (Scotland), Singapore, Api, Labuan, Kuching (all in North Borneo), Penang, and Hong Kong. Britain enjoys transport rights in four places within our territory: Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Kunming. Hong Kong has a special status, and the number of seats on British flights between Hong Kong and Shanghai shall not exceed one hundred per week. The British will provide their own equipment for the seaplane airport set up by the British in Shanghai, and our side will send personnel to manage it.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The National Government issued an order on the 17th: Appointing Foreign Minister Wang Shijie as the plenipotentiary representative for negotiating the Sino-British Air Transport Agreement and exchange of letters.</p>
<h3>The National Army Re-Unites Between Xu and Ji; The Communist Army of Shandong Flees in Three Routes; The War Situation Can Be Fully Clarified in the Short Term</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, July 16th] The date of complete annihilation of the Communist bandits of Shandong is imminent. The war situation in Shandong can be fully clarified in the short term. The National Army has deployed several ingenious encirclements in the Xiangzhong mountainous area and the western Shandong plains, trapping about 180,000 of the remaining main forces of the Communist Army of Shandong in the encirclements. They are currently employing tactics of simultaneous advance, combined attacks, ambushes, and comprehensive suppression to annihilate the Communist forces. Although the Communist forces have been scurrying around like wolves, blindly fleeing in disorder in an attempt to break out of the encirclement and escape the battlefield, it is now absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Yanzhou, July 16th] The National Army on the Xu-Ji section of the Jinpu Railway once again completed its reunion on the 16th, north of Dagaikou and Tai'an. The main force of Chen Yi's seven columns has fled and gathered in the outer areas of Zichuan, Boshan, and Laiwu. The National Army is closely monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, July 16th] The Communist Army's 1st and 4th Columns and the 13th Division, with more than 20,000 men, launched a fierce attack on the east, west, and north gates of Teng County on the night of the 14th. The defending troops calmly counterattacked, and fierce fighting lasted all night. By the morning of the 15th, the Communist Army had suffered 700 to 800 casualties, and four mountain guns were destroyed. Unable to withstand the attacks, they collapsed and retreated. On the 16th, the defending troops continued to pursue and annihilate the Communist forces in the suburbs in the rain, expanding their victory. The Communist forces that attacked the area north of Yanzhou have been repelled.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Yanzhou, July 16th] The focus of the war in western Shandong has shifted to the Jinxiang and Juye area. Liu Bocheng concentrated his main force to attack Yangshanji, 25 li north of Jinxiang, for as long as four days and nights. Two divisions of the National Army are stationed in that area and are currently launching a pincer attack with the National Army reinforcements advancing south from Jining and Jiaxiang. The intensity of the battle is unprecedented since Liu Bocheng's troops crossed the river this time.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Xuzhou, July 16th] The Communist bandits of the East China Field Army, fleeing in three routes within the territory of Shandong, have encountered the National Army's Gu Luzhou and Qiu Guoguang's simultaneous advance and combined attacks. They are now at the end of their rope and facing imminent annihilation. The 1st, 4th, and 5th Columns in southern Shandong were driven out of Teng and Zao areas. Part of the force fled back to the mountainous areas of Feixian, and another part took Baobinzhuang as their nest and attacked Teng County. The 3rd, 8th, and 10th Columns in central Shandong were driven out of Tai'an, and their main force scattered and retreated to the Laishan stronghold. The 2nd, 6th, 7th, and 9th Columns in the Yishan area were driven out of Yishui and Nanma, and their main force has fled to the southeast of the mountainous area. The National Army is now pursuing fiercely and holding firm, engaging in fierce battles with the various Communist bandit forces, all of which are taking the absolute offensive. According to prisoners captured on the battlefield, the Communist bandits are currently facing a desperate situation with food and ammunition exhausted. Each person can barely get one meal every three days, and each gun is equipped with less than ten bullets. In the past, they could still hope for supplies from underground warehouses in the Yishan mountainous area, but now the mountains have been lost and the warehouses are empty. Furthermore, their attempt to seek food locally by fleeing has been thwarted by the barren land and impoverished people, as well as the fierce pursuit by the National Army, resulting in nothing but death. The people have no fighting spirit, and morale is extremely low.</p>

<h3>Soviet Workers Mining in Xinjiang; Many Residents of Yili are of Soviet Nationality; Soviet Consul Refuses to Disclose the Number of People with Soviet Nationality</h3>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Dihua, July 11th] (Delayed) A certain important government official declared to the United Press reporter today that the Soviet Union is mining oil in the border areas of Xinjiang. Soviet miners are also accelerating the mining of tungsten in areas such as Yili, Altay, and Gulja. The largest oil-producing area is the small town of Usu, east of Dihua. These oil wells were opened during the reign of Sheng Shicai, a pro-Soviet warlord. In 1942, Mr. Sheng changed his policy and expelled the Soviet miners, but they had already surveyed the oil wells, dismantled them, and filled them in beforehand, numbering about fifteen to twenty. The Yili rebels, in opposition to the central government, allowed the Soviets to re-enter the oil fields and freely mine them. The extent of political activity among the people of Yili can be seen in the number of people who have obtained Soviet nationality. According to precise estimates, an average of seven out of ten applicants are approved. According to the Soviet authorities, the applicants were originally Soviet people. This time, they are simply restoring their nationality. When the reporter inquired with Soviet Consul General Savelyev about the report on the number of applicants for naturalization, he retorted angrily, "What is the reason for asking? How dare you ask a diplomatic representative of another country for this kind of report? If you want to check the number of Soviet expatriates, please ask the police station." Mr. Savelyev clearly did not want to answer questions of a "political" nature, and the interview ended abruptly.</p>
<p>Tense Situation in Dihua, Frequent Terrorist Activities</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Dihua, July 9th] (Delayed) For months, terrorists from both sides vying for power in Xinjiang have been inciting violence and attacking sympathizers of the opposing side in the streets. The newspapers are filled with news of Han Chinese, Kazakhs, and Uyghurs being ambushed and subjected to cruel torture in broad daylight on the main thoroughfares of Dihua. These people are also forced to confess to malicious political activities. Such incidents have occurred at least ten times in recent weeks, often in the southern suburbs. A government official told the United Press reporter today that the instigators are radical elements from the Yili rebel youth league. Earlier this week, the Kazakh driver of the British Consulate was also beaten and wounded in the head. He staggered into the police station to report the incident. The consul was out at the time, so the police officer notified the neighboring American Consul Paxton to take him away. The conflict arose from the Chinese central government's appointment of Masud Sabri as the chairman of Xinjiang. Mr. Masud Sabri is a doctor who studied in Turkey and often resides abroad. The opposition believes that he cannot represent the people of Xinjiang. In addition to terrorist acts, there is also a widespread network of political espionage, eavesdropping on telephones and monitoring the actions of government military and political officials and foreign consuls.</p>
<p>A Heated Debate at a Banquet Hosted by Zhang Zhizhong for the Soviet Envoy</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Dihua, July 7th] Regarding the Outer Mongolian invasion of Xinjiang, Soviet Consul General Savelyev told the United Press reporter today, "The whole incident is another example of American newspapers having headlines but no facts. If you want to know the situation, please ask the Chinese government." When Soviet Ambassador to China Petrov returned home to report on his work, he passed through here and attended a banquet hosted by Zhang Zhizhong, the former chairman of Xinjiang Province, on the same night. Achimjan, the leader of the Yili rebellion, was also present. After several rounds of drinks, Achimjan insisted on speaking, expressing his impatience with the Xinjiang Provincial Assembly's inability to exercise its functions (Achimjan was originally a school guard who had studied in Moscow). Mr. Zhang immediately refuted him, blaming the other party. Achimjan then replied fiercely in Russian, strongly stating that Yili had not received a benevolent guarantee from the Chinese government. Mr. Zhang then stood up in anger and criticized the Yili rebels for failing to fulfill the agreement to allow the National Army to enter the north. The Yili area is rich in resources such as oil, gold, and tungsten, which are rumored to be transported to the Soviet Union in a steady stream. The debate lasted for a long time, but gradually subsided due to a word from the Soviet Consul General. He said, "The war is over, please try to negotiate peace." Petrov nodded in agreement but did not express his opinion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Dihua, July 15th] Soviet Consul General in Dihua, Savelyev, left Dihua this morning to return to his country to report on his work.</p>
<p>British War Office Issues Statement Denying the Presence of British Troops in Xinjiang</p>

<h3>The United States Invites Member Countries of the Far Eastern Commission to Preliminary Discussions on the Japanese Peace Treaty; Meeting Scheduled for August 19th in Washington, D.C.</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 16th] A certain diplomatic authority stated: The United States originally intended to begin negotiations on the Japanese peace treaty only after the signing of the peace treaty with Germany and Austria. However, due to the numerous problems in the European situation and no hope for reconciliation in the foreseeable future, there is now a possibility of starting negotiations on the Japanese peace treaty ahead of schedule. Our country, as a major Far Eastern country with the most interaction with Japan, the longest war, and the deepest understanding, urgently needs officials with outstanding qualities to propose a plan to strive for a thorough peace in the Far East through this peace treaty. The relevant authorities will intensify their work on this matter.</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Washington, July 16th] The State Department Press Office announced today that the United States has invited member countries of the Far Eastern Commission to convene an eleven-nation conference in Washington, D.C., on August 19th to discuss the Japanese peace treaty. This conference is of a "preliminary" nature and will focus on the "technical" aspects of drafting the treaty. Completing the draft will undoubtedly take months.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Dispatch from Washington, July 16th] The United States proposed on the 16th that the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission should convene a preliminary meeting on the Japanese peace conference in San Francisco or Washington on August 19th. The proposal has been submitted to the foreign ministers of various countries, including Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Before taking preliminary measures to resolve the Japanese peace treaty, a response from Moscow must first be obtained. MacArthur has previously believed that the Japanese peace treaty should be signed within a year to eighteen months. As for negotiations on the German treaty, they seem to be indefinitely postponed. American officials are extremely hopeful of concluding a treaty with Japan ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>The American proposal advocates holding a preliminary meeting of experts first, and then a formal meeting of full representatives from each country. The United States suggested San Francisco as the preferred venue, and Washington as the second choice if other countries object.</p>
<p>The countries participating in the meeting should include those that participated in the Far Eastern Commission under the agreement reached by the three great powers at the Moscow Conference in December 1945. However, these countries are not participating in the capacity of representatives of the Far Eastern Commission. These countries are China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union (these four countries have veto power in the Far Eastern Commission), as well as Australia, New Zealand, India, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and France. Secretary of State Marshall intends to have his subordinates handle the negotiations during the preparatory meeting, as Mr. Marshall will be attending the Pan-American Conference in the capital of Brazil and will not be able to participate in the meeting on the scheduled date. This time also conflicts with the Imperial Conference initiated by Australia, which is scheduled to be held in Canberra on August 22nd. The purpose of the conference is to establish a unified front among the British dominions for the Japanese peace treaty negotiations.</p>
<p>American officials are extremely concerned about Australia's efforts, fearing that the British dominions will form a group with a common policy that can veto any proposed plan with a two-thirds majority. However, it is expected that there will not be many difficulties with the Japanese peace treaty. The issue of Japan's borders has already been stipulated by the Potsdam Declaration, limited to the four islands of its mainland. It is expected that no one will advocate amending the Yalta Agreement, which allows the Soviet Union to annex the Kuril Islands and the southern half of Sakhalin Island. As for the issue of reparations, which is hindering the agreement on the German issue, it is not expected to cause any major difficulties in the Japanese issue. According to MacArthur's subordinates, the amount of reparations that China, the Soviet Union, and other countries have already obtained is approximately 40 billion US dollars, including the Japanese assets that the Soviet Union removed from Northeast China and Korea.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Members Wan Can and Others Submit Emergency Proposal: Our Country Should Stop Considering Opening Trade with Japan and Terminate Sending Business Delegations to Japan</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 16th] Supervisory Committee members Wan Can, Yu Shude, She Guangxun, Li Shijun, Wang Guanwu, and others submitted an emergency proposal on the 16th, requesting the government to stop considering opening trade with Japan under the current circumstances and to terminate sending business delegations to Japan. This emergency proposal has been reviewed by the President of the Legislative Yuan and has been formally submitted. It is also heard that the President of the Executive Yuan intends to suggest to the State Council that it conduct a comprehensive review of Sino-Japanese economic relations and establish a special agency to handle the matter. It is reported that the Supervisory Committee members Wan Can and others expressed much dissatisfaction in their proposal with the agencies responsible for handling trade with Japan, believing that they only paid attention to technical issues and failed to make proper plans for the overall policy. Wan Can and others pointed out that the Japanese government's proposed Sino-Japanese trade plan for 1947 stipulated that Japan would export 99.18 million US dollars worth of goods to China, while China would only export 47.68 million US dollars to Japan. It is extremely unreasonable that China would have a trade deficit of over 50 million US dollars. Secondly, the goods that Japan will export to China are mostly impractical items such as bicycles, watches, and cameras, while the goods that China will export are coal and other materials that are also extremely scarce in our own country. This should be difficult for our country to accept. The proposal also pointed out that Japan is a country that invaded China, and its future intentions are worth paying attention to. Therefore, before Japanese militarism is completely eradicated, the peace treaty with Japan is signed, Japan fulfills its international obligations, peace in the Far East and the world is ensured, and our internal situation is fully stabilized, it is recommended to stop considering opening trade with Japan and to terminate sending business delegations to Japan.</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Nanjing, July 16th] With the resumption of private trade with Japan on August 15th, Chinese economic experts are deeply concerned that Japan will once again implement "economic aggression." Currently, there are almost no goods that China can export to Japan. On the other hand, since the end of the war, Japan's industry has not suffered any losses and is capable of dumping various manufactured goods on China. Moreover, the salt that China sends to Japan is sufficient to boost its chemical industry, while this industry is at a standstill in China. Furthermore, MacArthur's regulations require Japan's foreign trade to be calculated in US dollars, which is tantamount to a "one-way street."</p>
<h3>Lottery to Allocate Second Batch of Japanese Reparations Ships to Be Held Today</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, July 16th] The lottery for the second batch of 32 of the 93 Japanese reparations ships is scheduled for tomorrow morning, to be allocated to the four countries: China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Epiphyllum Blooming in Suzhou; Iron Tree Budding and Flowering</h3>

Recently, three of them suddenly bloomed white flowers from the edges of the leaves, with a light fragrance, which faded after two hours. Many people came to watch for a time. Furthermore, an iron tree in the garden also budded and flowered yesterday, which is truly auspicious.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Spokesperson Discusses Opening Private Trade with Japan; Clarifies Key Points Regarding Application Procedures, Etc.</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, July 16th] The spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently made a statement on the opening of private trade with Japan, stating that domestic industrial and commercial figures have attached great importance to the news of the opening of private trade with Japan, and it is predicted that after the method of selecting and dispatching business representatives is determined in the future, applications to go will be very enthusiastic. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is intensifying preparations for this matter with relevant agencies and has convened meetings to conduct preliminary discussions on issues such as the allocation of import and export trade quotas, the application qualifications and procedures for representatives to Japan, and the review procedures for representative qualifications. It will be officially announced after legalization. However, in principle, there are some points that need to be explained to promote the attention of all parties: (1) This opening of private trade with Japan is not a completely free trade nature. There are still considerable restrictions on the types of imports and exports, the factories, mines, companies, and firms applying to trade with Japan, and the selection of their representatives. The Allied Headquarters is also paying close attention to the above points, and our government must handle it carefully. (2) This dispatch of business representatives to Japan is of a trial nature. Although the quota is tentatively set at 64 people, it is still subject to change at any time depending on the actual trade situation in the future. Therefore, whether the future development of Sino-Japanese trade can truly reach the ideal level still depends on the efforts of the personnel going to Japan this time to make good use of the opportunity and strive for it. (3) The quota of 64 business representatives that our country sends to Japan means that no more than 64 people should exceed this number at the same time. The Allied Headquarters stipulates that the stay period for each person going to Japan is very short, and the task must be completed quickly. After this batch of personnel returns one after another, others can still be sent in rotation to fill the vacancies. Therefore, anyone applying to trade with Japan can have the hope of being invited as long as his business operations, qualifications, and experience meet the conditions for dispatch.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Subsidizes Japanese Export Policy; American Textile Industry Also Expresses Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from New York, July 15th] Several international traders told a Central News Agency reporter today that they did not attack MacArthur's policy of subsidizing Japanese exports from August 15th. They all believe that the subsidy is indirect rather than direct. This subsidy will mainly be applied to American cotton exports to Japan. It is said that MacArthur's policy aims to have the American government subsidize American cotton exporters to ensure that they obtain fair prices, while also ensuring that Japanese textile merchants obtain cotton supplies. They all believe that from China's standpoint, this subsidy policy may cause the Japanese textile industry to defeat the Chinese textile industry. However, in the United States, this matter does not necessarily affect any particular country, because the Allied Headquarters' policy is to promote multilateral commerce between Japan and various countries (especially Far Eastern countries). However, some people believe that the United States is taking a subsidy policy to restore Japan's international trade. There are some areas that have been neglected, and at the same time, people in the American textile industry have also expressed dissatisfaction with the subsidy policy. The Japanese textile industry may hit the American textile industry. Behind the scenes of the American government's recovery of private trade in Japan is the goal of reducing its occupation costs. It is generally believed that Japanese industry must be restored to the following extent: that is, the proceeds from its exports must be sufficient to pay for all its imports, and this move may limit the outflow of American money. It is said that the United States has spent 3 billion US dollars in Japan since January last year. At the same time, American businessmen believe that the impact on American commerce in the early stages of restoring trade with Japan is minimal, and the first step in restoring Japanese trade is to investigate the situation and determine what kind of trade can be done.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Anti-Smuggling in the Kowloon Area; Plans and Budget Prepared</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 16th] The government recently decided to strengthen anti-smuggling work in the Kowloon area of ​​South China. The plan and budget have been approved by the Political Affairs Conference on the 15th. The main points are: The smuggling of imports and exports in South China is too rampant. In December of last year, Bei Zuyi, former General Manager of the Central Bank, went to Hong Kong to negotiate with the Hong Kong government. An agreement on cooperative anti-smuggling measures was jointly formulated and approved by Song Meiling, the former president of the Executive Yuan. The Central Bank allocated 3 million Hong Kong dollars to the Kowloon Customs to handle the matter. However, the Hong Kong government has not yet signed the agreement, so the funds cannot be allocated as planned. Regarding financial and anti-smuggling issues, our government is actively consulting with the Hong Kong government. However, regardless of whether an agreement can be reached, it is necessary to strengthen the anti-smuggling work of the Kowloon Customs. The Customs Service has prepared a plan and budget: (1) Land anti-smuggling: re-repair and add branch checkpoints, requiring a total of 461,000 Hong Kong dollars. (2) Sea Patrol: Add sea branch checkpoints and lighters, requiring a total of 2,255,000 Hong Kong dollars. (3) Set up a radio station, requiring 241,000 Hong Kong dollars (4) Travel expenses for customs police to Kowloon for service, approximately 93,000 Hong Kong dollars. The total of the above four items is 3 million Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Embankment Restoration Talks Yield No Results; Ye Nan Reports on the Process; Cleveland Orders UN Personnel to Withdraw</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 16th] Major General Ye Nan of the Ministry of National Defense reported on the progress of the mixed committee organized to benefit the Yellow River repair and defense, and to accept the UN proposal at the press conference of the News Bureau of the Executive Yuan at 5 pm on the 16th. Ye said: The Communist representatives withdrew from the meeting on the pretext of not having received this suggestion, so if the Yellow River dike breaks in the future, the Communist side should be responsible. Ye first reported the composition process of the mixed committee and then said that when the canal representative government arrived in Kaifeng on June 30, they received the news that Liu Bocheng's troops had crossed the river. When the meeting was held in Dongming on July 1, the staff of the Ministry of Water Resources reported on the progress of the repair and defense work, saying that the workers had been driven away by the Communist side 23 times. If the truce problem could not be resolved, the embankment repair could not be carried out in fact. Representatives and government representatives explained the importance of embankment repair. Liu's department crossing the river was to hinder the embankment repair and destroy the embankment repair, but the Communist representatives withdrew from the meeting on the pretext that they had not received the UN proposal, and the negotiations were interrupted. After Mr. Hua returned to Beijing, he listened to the Communist broadcast, saying that Liu's troops crossed the river to commemorate the 26th anniversary of the Communist Army, but if the Yellow River dike breaches and floods, the lives of 3 to 4 million people will be threatened. Mr. Ye also said that the flood is approaching, and flooding may occur at any time. The current central work of the Ministry of Water Resources has shifted from embankment repair to rescuing dangerous projects.</p>
<p>[News from this newspaper] Cleveland of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration office in China, after receiving a memorandum from Chen Cheng, Chief of Staff of our Ministry of National Defense (original text in yesterday's newspaper), formally ordered UN personnel engaged in embankment restoration work in the Communist-held area along the Yellow River yesterday to immediately evacuate to Kaifeng and not to provoke any unnecessary danger.</p>
<p>It is reported that there are not many UN personnel working in the area, and a full list is currently being checked. At the same time, the Chinese government authorities were also asked to cancel the reasons for guaranteeing the safety of embankment restoration staff.</p>

<h3>National Trade Union Issues Solemn Declaration Opposing Absurd Resolution of World Federation of Trade Unions: Hong Kong Trade Union Absolutely Cannot Represent Chinese Trade Unions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 16th] The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), at its general assembly held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in June of this year, passed a resolution recognizing and supporting the Hong Kong Trade Union as the official representative of Chinese trade unions.

The above declaration was issued by the trade unions of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Chongqing, and others, as well as the Chinese Seamen's Union, the National Postal Workers' Union, and the Chinese Labor Association. Its main points are as follows: (1) Hong Kong is currently a region where China's administrative power cannot be exercised.

(2) Zhu Xuefan, who was removed from his position as Chairman of the Chinese Labor Association due to reorganization and re-election, and who is also suspected of embezzling funds donated by the United States for aid to China, was reported by the Chongqing General Labor Union.

(3) We welcome the WFTU to send personnel to China for inspection to gain a better understanding of the facts. Chinese workers sincerely hope to unite with workers from all countries who love freedom and democracy, recognize their goals, and work together.</p>

<h3>A Beautiful Corpse Outside Zhenjiang: Seven Orifices Show Bruising, Suggesting Strangulation; Body Has Been Stored for Three Days Without Identification</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 16th] At 7 AM on the 13th, a female corpse, approximately 20 years old, with a perm, wearing a red and black polka-dot voile short-sleeved cheongsam, and purple rubber-soled strap shoes, was discovered near the shooting range on the left side of the Zhenjiang Southern Suburb Provincial Highway. Beside the body was a small canvas bag containing an old blue striped tie, a female garter belt, a National Theater ticket dated the 12th, half a Sullivan bread, four orange candies, and 11,700 Legal Tender. Li Zhengguang, the leader of the Provincial Council Guard, telegraphed the police station and reported to the District Court. After inspection and collection at 4 PM that afternoon, no relatives have claimed the body for three days. According to the police officer handling the case, the corpse's face was purplish-blue and swollen, with bruising in all seven orifices. The eyes were swollen and slightly drooping, the pupils were dilated and streaked with blood, the tongue was pressed against the teeth, and the front of the neck was purplish-blue and swollen. The skin was pale with slight swelling, except for the purple spots on the hands. The abdomen was slightly distended. According to the inspectors, she was not a virgin, and there was a small amount of purple stool outside the anus, suggesting death by strangulation. Based on the theater ticket found on the body, the time of death was after 9 PM. However, it is difficult to determine whether the killer was one person or several because several local farmers and vendors had passed by the body, leaving mixed footprints. Since no relatives have claimed the body after three days, it is suspected that she was from out of town and was premeditatedly murdered. After the incident, Provincial Police Chief [something is illegible] Ren paid close attention and personally ordered Criminal Police Captain Xia Xiangmin to intensify the investigation. This morning, Shao Guoguo, Chief of the Judicial Section of the Bureau, notified Liang Guanjun, Chief of the First Branch, to prepare another coffin for a shallow burial so that relatives could claim the body. The body was initially wrapped in reed mats when it was collected on the 13th, which would easily lead to decomposition. However, due to rain all day today, the re-burial could not be carried out and is planned for tomorrow morning. At that time, the relevant authorities also plan to take photos for investigation.</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Close of the European Economic Conference</h3>
<p>As US Secretary of State General Marshall renewed his call for aid to Europe at the annual meeting of American governors in Salt Lake City, the European Economic Cooperation Conference, convened on the basis of the "Marshall Plan," was simultaneously completing the first phase of the European Recovery Program. The European Economic Cooperation Conference, convened due to the unsuccessful conclusion of the Big Three Foreign Ministers' Conference, has now come to a satisfactory close. Although this Paris Conference is called the European Economic Cooperation Conference, the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the "Marshall Plan" has influenced the attitudes of some Eastern European countries. In essence, it only included Western European countries, and even Franco's Spain was not included. Turkey and Greece, although located in Eastern Europe, also participated in this historic meeting. According to news reports, the achievement of the Paris Conference was the decision to establish a reconstruction design agency, which will meet immediately in Paris and complete the entire report by September 1 to submit to the United States. A cooperation committee will also be established within this agency, with the full participation of sixteen countries. Even countries that currently resist the Marshall Plan can join in the future. In addition, this agency will establish an executive committee and four technical committees to handle food, electricity, steel, and transportation issues separately. From this, we can see how closely European countries, except for the Soviet Union and those aligned with it, are cooperating to propose their recovery plans in order to obtain US assistance. In view of the recent trends in the international situation, the US government and public, having heard calls from responsible leaders such as President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall to step up aid to traditional allies, will surely unite to support them. After Congress reopens in the autumn, the "Marshall Plan" will undoubtedly see more concrete developments.</p>
<p>European countries suffered enormous losses after the war, and US assistance should be welcomed. However, the Soviet Union believes that US assistance has the potential for political interference and refuses to accept it. Countries such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, and Hungary, in general, do the people, even the governments, not also want to participate in the Marshall Plan in order to achieve their own economic recovery? Only because the Soviet Union's attitude is so firm, they have no choice but to abandon their original intentions and refuse to participate in the European Economic Cooperation Conference held in Paris. The attitude of the Czech government, which initially expressed willingness to participate and then refused, is particularly striking to the world. The Marshall Plan is indeed an economic plan that uses the economic power of the United States to assist in the recovery of Europe. After rejecting this Marshall Plan, there must be a plan to replace it, so that these countries are not too disappointed. This is why we hear about the so-called "Molotov Plan," which is proposed to counter the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>According to news from London, the Soviet Union has proposed and is implementing the "Molotov Plan" to counter the Marshall Plan and assist the economic recovery of Eastern European countries. It is said that nine Eastern European countries will join this plan: the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Finland, Yugoslavia, and Albania. German regions occupied by the Soviet Union may also join the plan. The core of this plan is to reject US dollar aid in order to avoid accepting any political conditions. Countries joining the Molotov Plan will implement economic unification, share resources, engage in planned production under a common plan, and establish a customs union. To implement this plan, the Soviet Union has signed various economic agreements with Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. According to this, the Soviet Union is pursuing its economic policy in Eastern European countries.</p>
<p>We hope that this Molotov Plan can truly help the economic recovery of Eastern European countries. However, considering the so-called unification, resource sharing, and planned production, the results may not be as ideal as the general public hopes. The "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" still leaves fresh wounds on the world, especially on the people of the Far East. After the war, the general public hopes to avoid a repetition of the "encirclement" situation. However, the current international situation has undoubtedly entered a situation of "encirclement" again. Although this confrontation between the Marshall Plan and the Molotov Plan is perhaps unavoidable given the current international situation, we always hope that if there is a confrontational situation, the conflict can be minimized or even eliminated. Only by eliminating conflict can the hope for lasting international peace be ensured.</p>
<p>The current moment is indeed a critical juncture in human history. Current signs have caused the "one world" concept that emerged during World War II to become illusory. "One world" will belong to two camps, two "encirclements." The proposal of the so-called Molotov Plan in addition to the Marshall Plan further bankrupts the concept of "one world." The convening and closing of the Paris European Economic Cooperation Conference can be said to have ended an era and unfolded a new chapter in the world's post-war history. The road ahead is not necessarily smooth. We sincerely hope that the political leaders of the great powers can save humanity from future catastrophes and cooperate sincerely to ensure lasting world peace.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Delegation Decides to Assist Greece in Suppressing Rebellion; Secretary of State Marshall Expresses Directly</h3>
<p>Greek Government Forces Launch Offensive, Guerrillas Encircled</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 16th (Radio): Secretary of State Marshall stated today that the U.S. military delegation to Greece will instruct Greek forces on how to fight against the guerrillas. Marshall said the main objective of the U.S. military delegation is to determine what kind of equipment the government forces need to deal with the guerrillas. As for whether the U.S. military representatives will go to northwestern Greece, Marshall did not comment. When a reporter asked if the U.S. representatives would instruct the Greek government forces to fight the guerrillas, Marshall replied that he believed such instructions were very possible.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 16th (Dispatch)] TASS, from the capital of Yugoslavia: Greek guerrilla leader Markos accused the British and Americans of interfering in the Greek civil war. He also, "in his capacity as Senior Commander of the Greek Democratic Army," condemned the British and American authorities for supporting the Greek fascist elements and instigating a large-scale civil war. According to reports from the Albanian News Agency carried in local newspapers, the British and Americans are aiding the Greek government, and it is alleged that U.S. military officers are participating in Greek military planning conferences, and that the British Air Force is participating in airstrikes against the guerrillas.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 16th (Radio): According to sources close to the Greek General Staff, the situation on the Greek front has taken a sharp turn for the worse today. At dawn, the 23rd Brigade of the Greek government's fresh forces joined the battle, launching a fierce attack on 2,000 guerrillas who had suddenly appeared near Albania. The 23rd Brigade is well-equipped and has bomber support. It is said that with the help of aircraft, the 23rd Brigade has blocked the guerrillas trying to break through, nine miles from Albania.</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 16th (Dispatch)] A spokesman for the Greek General Staff stated on the 16th: "Forty-five thousand Greek troops have encircled the invading guerrillas, most of whom are trapped in the Karpathian region, attempting to escape back to Albania. Details are still awaited from the front lines." Meanwhile, according to a TASS dispatch from Jena on the 16th: the official Albanian News Agency denies that any international legions have been sent from Albania to fight in Greece.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 15th (Dispatch)] Greek military sources say that large numbers of guerrillas and supplies are concentrated in three locations in Albania near the Greek border, and in three locations within Yugoslavia near the Greek border. The exact locations of these concentrations have not been revealed. At the same time, arrests of conspirators continue throughout Greece. It is rumored here today that the government will announce a list of suspected persons, but this has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th (Dispatch)] The British Foreign Office announced on the 15th that, according to British investigations, there is no evidence to date to confirm the participation of international brigades in the so-called Greek border incidents.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th (Dispatch)] Rumors that the British Foreign Office had stated that if international legions participated in the Greek war, Britain would protest to the United Nations have been denied by a Foreign Office spokesperson. He stated briefly: "We have made no such statement, nor is it necessary for us to state our position."</p>
<h3>Security Council to Convene Special Sessions Today and Tomorrow to Discuss Balkan Situation; U.S. Representative Johnson's Request Finally Approved</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 15th (Dispatch)] The United Nations Security Council has rejected a U.S. proposal to convene an emergency meeting on the 16th to discuss the Greek situation. The Soviet Union initially opposed it, believing there was no need to convene an emergency meeting. France also issued a warning, stating that the United Nations should not act hastily regarding the increasingly tense situation in Greece. The U.S. proposal to convene an emergency meeting on the 16th received only six votes in favor, including the U.S. itself, but seven votes are required to pass a procedural resolution in the Security Council. China, Poland, and Colombia all supported France and the Soviet Union and opposed the U.S. proposal. U.S. Representative Johnson then warned that the situation brewing in Greece over the past 48 hours could erupt at any moment. The Security Council finally passed the U.S. request, scheduling two special meetings for the 17th and another special meeting for the 18th.</p>
<h3>British Fleet Commander Jago to Visit Greek Territorial Waters</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th (Dispatch)] The British Admiralty has announced that the British cruiser HMS "Liverpool" will visit Athens on the 18th, and three warships from the Mediterranean Fleet, including the aircraft carrier HMS "Victorious," will also enter Greek territorial waters during their summer cruise next week. An Admiralty spokesman insisted that this trip has no political purpose and was planned long before the current crisis in Greece.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 15th (Dispatch)] Rumors from Athens that the U.S. fleet might sail to Greek ports under the current circumstances have been denied by the U.S. Navy Department, which said that no ships are sailing to Greece.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Still Dissents on International Police Force Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 15th (Dispatch)] The Security Council met today to discuss the issue of an international security police force. The U.S. representative believes that the Soviet Union seems unwilling and unable to contribute its share. Representatives immediately proposed consulting the Soviet Union on the size and organization of the security police force. The Soviet Union consistently dissented, resulting in no agreement being reached. Earlier, the British representative proposed that the five-power military staff committee should agree on an estimate of the strength of this force by August 5, which was supported by most. The Australian and French proposals were more complex, hoping that the Soviet Union would express its views. At this point, Soviet Representative Molotov insisted that he did not intend to discuss the size of this force before the allocation of the five powers' contributions between East and West was resolved.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 15th (Dispatch)] It is rumored in British political circles today that there may be another reorganization of the Attlee Cabinet, and the trend is either to form a coalition government or to hold a general election. It can now be considered certain that the India Office will be abolished, and the current Secretary of State for India, Lord Listowel, will be transferred to another position. Deputy Prime Minister and Lord President of the Council Herbert Morrison will resign. Foreign Secretary Bevin is in poor health and is believed to be resigning after the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in November. Talk of a general election revived after Morrison frankly announced that the British economic crisis would materialize in the autumn. However, the government has not publicly acknowledged the matter of a general election or the formation of a coalition government.</p>

<h3>Commemorating the Atomic Bomb, U.S. Scientists Speak Earnestly</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th (Dispatch)] On July 16, 1945, the first atomic bomb was successfully tested at Alamogordo, New Mexico, thus opening a new page in human history.

Only by organizing a world government that transcends all nations can peace be achieved and maintained. We should use all the resources of the United Nations to move towards world unity."</p>
<h3>European Economic Conference Concludes Successfully, Each Committee Begins Work</h3>
<p>Germany Will Also Participate in European Reconstruction Work in the Future</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 16th (Dispatch)] The Committee on European Economic Cooperation, which is drafting a plan for European economic recovery, held its first meeting at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 16th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 15th (Dispatch)] Sixteen European countries formed a group tonight, rapidly drafting a blueprint for a joint recovery plan within a six-week deadline, in order to avoid the threat of economic collapse that will be encountered this winter with the help of the United States. The European Economic Conference, which discussed European economic cooperation issues, ended tonight after four days. Important representatives from each country will leave here tomorrow to return home, but a new institution has been established in Paris, composed of representatives from sixteen countries, responsible for drafting the most ambitious international plan in history, to be completed by September 1 for submission to the United States for study.</p>
<p>The group composed of representatives from sixteen countries has now been named the "Committee on European Economic Cooperation," which includes an Executive Committee chaired by the United Kingdom, composed of representatives from France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway, and four technical subcommittees on food and agriculture, fuel and power, steel and transportation. Each committee will be formally established tomorrow, and its main tasks are as follows: (1) To study the production development of major industrial countries in Europe, so as to increase the strength of each country and promote trade relations between European countries. (2) To study the needs of various important items, so as to request assistance from foreign countries, especially the Western Hemisphere. This report will in fact be the blueprint for a four-year recovery plan. The Paris Economic Conference, at the insistence of small countries, will remain open, awaiting the Soviet Union and its eight affiliated countries to join.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 15th (Dispatch)] The German News Agency of the U.S. military zone stated: The Deputy Director of the U.S. military government in Germany, Brigadier General Keating, said that a delegation from western Germany might participate in the discussions on the Marshall Plan held in Paris at a later date. The U.S. military government did not send a delegation from the U.S. military zone to participate, because the initial negotiations did not involve U.S. officials, and the attendance of a delegation from the U.S. military zone would cause misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Investigating Resources, Clues Are Complicated</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 16th (Dispatch)] The first phase of the European Economic Cooperation Conference has been successful, but the participating representatives and observers all feel that this four-day conference only represents the beginning of the task. The real work will begin today and will continue for several weeks before it can be completed. Observers almost all believe that in the technical committees, the representatives will not only face the economic realities of the survey, but also the political issues that are intertwined with the economic issues. The German question is a clear example. The subcommittees on fuel and steel will inevitably have to consider the role of the Ruhr industrial area in any European recovery plan, which will inevitably involve how the Paris Conference will affect the basic issues of the Four Power Committee established by the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. The task of this Four Power Committee is to study the economic problems related to the unification of the German economy. Furthermore, the negotiations that Britain and the United States are about to begin in Washington on the Ruhr industry and the industrial standards of the British and American zones in Germany will also have a direct impact on the work of the Sixteen Nation Cooperation Committee. The task of the Food Subcommittee is also not as simple as imagined, because the food issue will inevitably involve the possibility of purchasing from the U.S. dollar zone and supplementing it by purchasing from outside the dollar zone.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Unilaterally Uses Veto, Seoul Conference Reaches Impasse; Brown Accuses Soviet Side of Violating Agreement</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Seoul, 15th (Dispatch)] U.S. Director of Civilian Affairs in Korea, Major General Brown, stated today that the first question in the U.S.-Soviet joint discussion on establishing a temporary Korean government is "whether one country can unilaterally decide to exercise a veto and refuse any party or organization it opposes to present its views." The Soviet delegation wants to use this veto power today. The U.S. delegation has repeatedly suggested systematically reviewing the list of Korean parties and organizations applying to present their views and considering the objections raised by the two delegations, but the Soviet Union has repeatedly refused. Although the Soviet delegation did not make specific accusations against any Korean party, it arbitrarily accused the Korean parties of lacking trust. The U.S. delegation firmly insisted on fully implementing the Marshall-Molotov Agreement established at the beginning of this year, which stipulates that all Korean democratic parties and organizations should be guaranteed the right to present their views to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 16th (Dispatch)] Major General Brown released a statement today on the proceedings of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission meeting, stating: "The U.S. and the Soviet Union have very different opinions on the identification of Korean parties and social organizations participating in the Joint Commission. The Soviet side believes that the number of parties and organizations should be reduced to a minimum, and parties and organizations should be distinguished. Organizations with central structures should have their local branches' right to participate canceled. At the same time, groups that oppose trusteeship and groups that are incompatible with the Moscow Agreement are also refused to participate in the meeting. The U.S. side argues that all parties and organizations that have signed in Statements No. 5 and No. 11 can be initially included in the groups that can attend the meeting, that they can be dismissed if they do not change their attitude after the meeting has formally opened, and that wide participation of parties and organizations in the Joint Commission is in complete accord with the spirit of the Moscow Agreement."</p>
<h3>U.S. Import and Export Controls Extended to February Next Year</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 15th (Special Dispatch)] President Truman today signed a new bill stipulating that import and export controls on scarce goods, including kerosene, tin, fats, and oils, should be extended to February next year. This decree empowers the government to designate priority for goods, and the State Department can promote U.S. foreign policy by issuing visas for the export of goods. Export controls will be applied to 400 types of goods, and import controls on fats, oils, fertilizer materials, and rice will continue. President Truman believes that U.S. control over foreign trade should continue to be supervised after it is lifted on March 1, 1948, but his goal is to eliminate interference with world commerce.</p>
<h3>British Pound Foreign Exchange Restored as International Currency</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 15th (Dispatch)] U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder announced that the U.S. government has agreed that the United Kingdom should, by September 15, allow China, Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Paraguay, Portugal, Romania, Siam, Turkey, Argentina, and Yugoslavia to fully convert all British pound foreign exchange earned from trade with the pound sterling area into foreign exchange of other currencies. The Anglo-American Financial Agreement originally stipulated that the United Kingdom should complete this procedure by July 15. The British government requested an extension because it could not complete the administrative procedures for the aforementioned 14 countries as scheduled. Snyder said that apart from the aforementioned 14 countries, the British government has fully fulfilled its obligations under the Financial Agreement and, since yesterday, has allowed British pound foreign exchange earned from trade with third countries or obtained by other means to be used freely to pay for trade in any currency area.</p>

<h3>Indian Independence Bill Progresses Smoothly, Passed on Third Reading in British House of Commons; British Prime Minister Hopes Partition Can Evolve into a Federal System</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 15th (Dispatch)] The House of Commons held the third reading debate on the Indian Independence Bill today, lasting three hours and forty-five minutes, and did not require a vote. Prime Minister Attlee, in closing the debate, said that the Indians could trust the full sympathy and assistance of the United Kingdom without the danger of dependence. He also expressed the hope that the partition of India could evolve into a federal system, so that the two parts of India could maintain unity and exercise full power. The Prime Minister expressed his gratitude to the House of Commons for the rapid passage of the bill, saying: "The British government sincerely hopes that the new government of India can carry out its mission."</p>
<p>The Earl of Winterton, representing the Conservative Party, concluded the debate by calling for friendship between Britain and India. At the beginning of the debate, Minister of Trade Cripps declared that Britain did not believe that it had completed its task by passing this Independence Bill. Since Pakistan and India are still part of the British Commonwealth, Britain still has a responsibility to promote their progress and prosperity. Butler of the opposition party expressed concern about the future status of the Indian princely states, hoping that the British government would handle any demands for independence from the princely states with sympathy and understanding.</p>
<p>Indian Provincial Constitutions Will Model Themselves on the United States</p>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 15th (Dispatch)] The Indian Constituent Assembly decided today to consider a report from a subcommittee that the provincial constitutions should be modeled on the United States. It stipulates that adults over the age of twenty-one have the right to vote, and the term of office for governors is four years. The governor can appoint officials and has the power to seize almost all legislative and administrative power in an emergency. Khosla, a former communist leader and now a member of the Muslim League, opposed this constitution because it did not adopt the Soviet model, but his motion was rejected.</p>

At the same time, according to House Speaker Martin, a special investigating committee will soon be established to review the needs of the sixteen European countries, with the assistance of three committees established by the President.</p>
<h3>Inside Story of the Japanese Communist Party</h3>
<p>Special Translation by Our Editorial Department</p>
<p>The Japanese Communist Party frequently consults with "Mitsubishi No. 21." "Mitsubishi No. 21" is the twenty-first building constructed on the property of the Mitsubishi Trading Company. Currently, it houses high-ranking cadres of the Soviet delegation to Japan.</p>
<p>On Meiji Street in Tokyo, near the famous Meiji Shrine, stands a gray, two-story cement building with a sign at the entrance that reads "Communist Party Headquarters." This "Red Shrine" is adjacent to a wooden house, which houses the untidy offices of the Communist Party newspaper, and a bookstore filled with Marxist books and newspapers.</p>
<p>Near the Tokyo Central Press Club, there is a five-story red building with the address "Mitsubishi No. 21" on its doorplate, the twenty-first building constructed on the property of the Mitsubishi Trading Company. Currently, it houses high-ranking cadres, numbering 218 people, of the Soviet delegation to Japan.</p>
<p>A strong red line connects the Communist Party Headquarters and Mitsubishi No. 21. The Japanese Communist Party frequently seeks instructions and consultations from Mitsubishi No. 21. The Soviet Union lacks personnel to undertake this task. Only nine people in the Soviet delegation can speak fluent Japanese. Therefore, old White Russian émigrés living in Japan are compelled to work for the Soviets. Orders are transmitted to Meiji Street and then transformed into action.</p>
<p>Communist Party members imprisoned by the Japanese authorities in Japan were released by the occupying forces in October 1945. Later, Japanese Communist Party members residing in China were also permitted to return to Japan. All these measures were based on the Potsdam Declaration and followed the orders of the American government, at a time when the twilight of the wartime alliance between democratic nations and the Soviet Union had not yet completely faded.</p>
<p>Since then, the Japanese Communist Party has gradually become the main tool of the Soviet Union to oppose and obstruct American policy toward Japan.</p>
<p>This group, which challenges the United States, has an organization that completely inherits the Soviet system. First, party members elect the National Communist Party Congress, and then the Congress elects a Central Committee of twenty members. They are the leaders of the Communist Party, but the real power is held by the Politburo. Three leaders control the Politburo, implement the party's resolutions, and determine the path of Japanese communism. These three leaders are:</p>
<p>(1) Kyuichi Tokuda—56 years old, born in Okinawa, a graduate of law school, and one of the founders of the Japanese Communist Party. He went to Moscow in 1922, 1926, and 1927, and was arrested three times, imprisoned from 1928 until 1945, when he was released by the American occupation forces. He was soon elected Secretary-General of the Communist Party and elected as a member of parliament in 1946. Tokuda is good at public speaking, is a radical anti-American, advocates violent revolution, and distrusts the masses. He might be regarded as a Trotskyist in the Soviet Union, but because of his loyalty to the cause, strong personality, and long period of imprisonment, he was eventually elected as the leader of the Communist Party.</p>
<p>(2) Tetsu Nozaka—55 years old, an economist, and the leader of the modern faction of the Japanese Communist Party, competing with Tokuda. He joined the Communist Party in his youth, went into exile in the Soviet Union in 1931, and has closer ties with the Soviet Union than any other Japanese Communist Party member. He served as a member of the Executive Committee of the Third International. In 1943, he went to Yan'an and returned to Japan in January 1946. Nozaka is highly respected by Japanese intellectuals, is familiar with foreign affairs, and also has close ties with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(3) Yoshio Shiga—46 years old, between the Tokuda and Nozaka factions, and imprisoned at the same time as Tokuda, but closer to Nozaka. He is good at public speaking and propaganda, and may be the most intellectually powerful person in the Japanese Communist Party. Those familiar with the inside story of the Japanese Communist Party all regard Shiga as the most dangerous figure in the party. (Translated from Newsweek, June 16, 1947)</p>

<h3>Sjahrir Returns to Yogyakarta Quickly; Indonesian Cabinet Meeting Still Yields No Result; Reportedly, Provisional Agreement to be Formed in Batavia Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 16th] With the tense situation in the Dutch East Indies, overseas Chinese are restless. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Office here has reported the situation by telegram to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs so that effective action can be taken promptly to prevent the 2 million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies from suffering collateral damage.</p>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 16th] The Indonesian Republic cabinet meeting held in Yogyakarta on the 16th to discuss Van Mook's joint gendarmerie and cease-fire proposals yielded no results. Another cabinet meeting will be convened tonight, with the Executive Committee of the Parliament attending, and a decision is expected. Prime Minister Sjahrir may take a special plane to Batavia tomorrow with the decision. Senior officials of the Republic have denied reports that foreign property in West Java has been demolished by the Indonesian army, stating that all houses are intact, and that only a few Dutch houses near Bandung have been damaged by the conflict between the two armies.

<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 16th] Authoritative sources declared today that Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir has reached a provisional agreement with key officials of the Dutch East Indies government on a compromise plan for the future gendarmerie deployment of the Indonesian Republic, whereby Indonesian gendarmerie will be responsible for maintaining public order, but if the local situation exceeds the scope of Indonesian control, a joint Dutch-Indonesian gendarmerie will be organized to take over the task. This point was the last major obstacle in the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations to establish a provisional government of the Indonesian federation, which had recently reached a stalemate and threatened to cause war. Sjahrir himself expressed his approval of the Dutch compromise plan when he consulted with acting Governor-General Van Mook of the Dutch East Indies yesterday, but it is still subject to the final decision of the Indonesian cabinet. Sjahrir has already flown back to Yogyakarta today. According to neutral sources, everything depends on whether Yogyakarta supports Sjahrir's proposal.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Surplus U.S. Military Supplies to be Sold to Japan at Low Prices; Over 70,000 Tons Already Sold</h3>
<p>[United Press, Miyanoshita, 16th] U.S. Eighth Army Supply Officer Hodges told newspaper publishers and editors visiting Japan from overseas that when the U.S. military withdraws, all U.S. military equipment, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, will be sold to the Japanese government or private individuals. Weapons and other purely military supplies will be destroyed, and some military supplies have already been destroyed. He also mentioned the Japanese military supplies handled by the Eighth Army, saying that purely military supplies, such as 26,000 tons of poison, have been destroyed. Items that can be used for civilian purposes, such as 16,000 vehicles, have been transferred to the civilian economy. A large quantity of surplus supplies from the Eighth Army (approximately 73,000 tons) has been sold to Japan at a price that is less than one-third of the original price. In general, the Japanese people cooperate very well with the occupying forces. American women can walk around Japan without any problems, and safety is guaranteed. The Japanese people like and respect the American army. When the U.S. military withdraws from some towns, residents request that troops be sent again.</p>

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The issue of workers' compensation insurance, caused by the establishment of the Ministry of Labor by the Japanese cabinet, was on the verge of a stalemate due to the conflicting opinions of Minister of Health Ichimatsu and State Minister Yonekura.

<h3>Standard Rent Measures Determined; Resolution Prohibits Unilateral Increases; Agreement Requires Consultation Based on Actual Expenses Plus Reasonable Profit; Collecting Tips Subject to Fines Up to Three Times</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The issue of standard rents in this city has been debated for a long time without resolution. At the third meeting of the Municipal Council, the Municipal Government drafted a temporary measure for standard rents in this city for discussion. The temporary measure stipulated that the maximum amount of standard rent should not exceed 1,800 times the base figure of 1937. The seventh meeting of the third congress of the Municipal Council decided to retain the rule, and the municipal government revised the standard of rental according to the factual situation. The Municipal Council has already sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting the implementation of the resolution. Subsequently, the Municipal Government received a letter from the National Economic Commission requesting that it draft concrete measures to stabilize rents in Shanghai and Nanjing for discussion by the commission. The 84th municipal meeting decided to convene a meeting of relevant agencies in this city for discussion in order to gather opinions.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., the municipal government convened a meeting in the conference room. Mayor Wu sent Secretary-General Shen Zonglian to preside over the meeting because he was presiding over another meeting. The attendees included Director of the Land Administration Bureau Zhu Ping, Specialist Wu Zunyi, Secretary Yang Zhu, Chief Judge of the Civil Division of the Local Court Xu Fuji, Chairman of the Real Estate Association Ma Shaoquan, Municipal Councilors Ma Junshuo and Shao Yongsheng, and representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Finance Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, totaling more than 40 people. After heated discussions, the opinions of all parties were summarized, and the Shanghai Municipal Housing Lease Management Measures were drafted, which will soon be promulgated and implemented by the municipal government. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The rental amount of houses in this city should be maintained as much as possible and should not be unilaterally increased arbitrarily. If an adjustment is necessary, it should be determined through consultation based on the landlord's actual expenses for the house (including housing tax, land value tax, rental income tax, insurance premiums, alleyway streetlights, fire hydrants, and watchman's wages, etc.), and a reasonable profit (10% of the total of the above-mentioned actual expenses).</p>
<p>Mediation May Be Requested If Agreement Cannot Be Reached</p>
<p>(2) If the landlord and tenant cannot reach an agreement, they may apply to the competent authorities for mediation in accordance with the provisions of Article 101 of the Land Law. Those who disagree with the mediation should file a lawsuit in the judicial organs. However, before the judicial organs make a ruling, the results of the mediation should be temporarily followed.</p>
<p>(3) For houses rented by schools, charitable organizations, autonomous agencies, cultural groups, or occupied by public school teachers, the standard rent should not exceed 80% of the multiple of the salaries of public school teachers based on pre-war base figures.</p>
<p>(4) Lessees may not sublet the entire leased premises to others. Those who sublet a portion of the premises in accordance with the provisions of the proviso of Article 443, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, whether for residential or commercial use, the rent should be calculated in proportion to the portion of the house sublet and the original rental amount, but should not exceed one times the original rent. The same applies to those with existing security deposits.</p>
<p>(5) The lease term of a fixed-term lease should not be less than one year. A term of less than one year is considered one year.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Prohibited - Rent Must Be Paid</p>
<p>(6) Rent is paid monthly and must not be calculated in foreign currency or in kind. If it was originally calculated in foreign currency or in kind, it should be converted into legal tender at the exchange rate and market price of the item on the date the lease was signed, and subsequent rental payments should be made in legal tender.</p>
<p>(7) In addition to rent, a security deposit may be collected for house rentals, and the maximum amount must not exceed the total amount of two months' rent. Those who violate the provisions of the preceding paragraph must return the excess to the lessee.</p>
<p>(8) Lessors must not collect tips or any other fees in any name other than rent and security deposits. Violators must return the entire amount and be fined up to three times the amount by the competent authorities.</p>
<p>(9) These measures will take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>Landlords Vigorously Argue for Breaking the Status Quo</p>
<p>The debate was very heated during yesterday's discussion. Zhou Zhongjie, a representative of the Real Estate Association, insisted that management expenses, depreciation, and legitimate profits should be added to the actual expenses of the house. He also advocated breaking the status quo to seek fairness and reasonableness. Municipal Councilor Shao Yongsheng appealed to landlords to consider the current extraordinary period and the instability of the social economy. While the sympathy and the landlords' demand for profits is understood, the affordability of the citizens must also be considered. Zhou Zhongjie believed that there is no need to worry about the affordability of the citizens. When formulating rules, they always assume that the citizens cannot afford rent, but in fact, even if the rent is raised again, the citizens will be able to afford it. He cited the example that the monthly rent for each room in the HSBC Building is 8 million, and some even use the cost of living as the standard for calculating rent, but there are still many people seeking to rent. However, after discussion by the congress, it was ultimately rejected, and the original measures were determined as above.</p>
<h3>Expanded Investigation of the Gold Rush Case; Decision Made Not to Prosecute</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Since the Gold Rush case was exposed by Councilor Luo Heng, the Ministry of Judicial Administration ordered the Municipal High Prosecutor's Office to forward it to the Local Prosecutor's Office for expanded investigation. Ding Chuanen, the prosecutor in charge of the case, has repeatedly summoned the defendants Bei Zuyi, Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, etc., for questioning. Yesterday, he announced the results of the investigation and decided not to prosecute them. The original text of the decision not to prosecute is recorded below: "The defendants Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren are the former director and deputy director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank. They were ordered to handle the distribution of gold from March of last year. The distribution method was divided into two types: open distribution and covert distribution. Open distribution was applied for and issued by the Gold and Silver Industry Association, while covert distribution was resold through five designated companies, including Tongfengyu. The quantity and price of daily distribution were jointly determined by the defendants. However, since the implementation of the distribution, the market price of gold has been chaotic and volatile, and has even soared. In February of this year, Councilors Luo Chong and others claimed that the defendants had not made careful plans in advance and could not suppress the price of gold afterwards, and were suspected of using their powers, colluding with officials and businessmen, undermining national policy, and illegally seeking profits. After deliberation by the Standing Committee of the Councilors' Council, the investigation was forwarded to the court. According to the Special Criminal Cases Law, cases sent directly to the court for trial by judicial police organs in a transfer letter are considered to be filed for public prosecution, as stipulated in Article 3 of the Special Criminal Cases Law. It is found that the defendants' criminal acts had been previously exposed, and the Songhu Garrison Command had prepared a transfer letter, together with relevant case files, and sent it directly to the Criminal Court of this court for trial. The criminal circumstances alleged by the councilors are the same case. According to the provisions of the aforementioned laws, regardless of whether the defendants are criminally liable, it should be determined by the Criminal Court, and this office has no room for comment. Except for Bei Zuyi, who has been disciplined because he has no criminal acts, the decision not to prosecute is made in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Procedure Law and Article 234, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law."</p>
<h3>Lin Fengbao Found Not Guilty; Prosecutor Disagrees</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] After the local court acquitted Lin Fengbao on July 12 in the Gold Rush case, sentenced Yang Anren to seven years in prison, and sentenced Zhan Liansheng to four years in prison, the judgment was delivered to the Local Prosecutor's Office yesterday. According to the prosecutor yesterday, the Business Bureau's distribution of gold was fraudulent and had been confirmed by the Criminal Court. How could Lin Fengbao, as the director, not know about it? Therefore, the judgment is unfair and he disagrees with it and will consider appealing to the High Court within the statutory period of ten days.</p>
<h3>New Measures Determined by Tax Bureau for 1947 Profit Tax</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The standard tax calculation for the 1947 profit tax has been determined by the Municipal Direct Tax Bureau. According to the figures declared by the Gu Gongshang firms, those with a turnover of more than 400 million yuan and earnings of more than 200 million yuan will be taxed based on account checking as a general principle. There are approximately 2,000 such businesses in the city, accounting for one-thirtieth of the total. Those with a turnover of less than 400 million yuan and earnings of less than 200 million yuan will still have their tax standards determined by spot-checking the books of each industry.</p>
<p>[Another Report] For the 1947 profit tax, since the principle of account checking should still be followed as approved by the Ministry of Finance, in order to save tax collection time, the scope of standard tax calculation has been expanded according to the actual situation of Shanghai's industrial and commercial units. In principle, 5% of each industry will be spot-checked. After receiving approval, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has informed each industry. Recently, the units to be checked in the wool, hardware, import and export, and paint industries have sent their books to the Tax Bureau for verification as scheduled. Representatives of the Chamber of Commerce and persons in charge of industry associations are also assisting during the account checking, and the process is very good. According to the Tax Bureau, if taxpayers believe that the assessed tax amount is doubtful, they should first pay half of the tax amount to the national treasury within ten days of receiving the payment notice, and then apply for a review. Applications will not be accepted after the deadline. If they do not apply for a review in accordance with the legal procedures within the deadline and do not pay the tax, they will be transferred to the court for punishment.</p>

<p>Methods Agreed Upon by the Traffic Research Association</p>

(3) Class C Inspection: A major inspection every one hundred and fifty days, such as disassembling and inspecting all steel plates. (4) Class D Inspection: A general inspection every four hundred and fifty days, that is, send the vehicle to the repair shop for thorough repair when it is due.</p>
<p>In addition, various issues such as vehicle speed, vehicle U-turns, violations of prohibitions, and accounting and personnel of transportation companies will be gradually studied in detail. According to Director Zhao, he told reporters yesterday: "All efforts to strengthen the management of public vehicles and improve the public transportation system, as well as all opinions and plans, are expected to be completed by the end of August, so as to make the public transportation in the city more modern and more perfect."</p>

<h3>US Permit for China National Aviation Corporation Still Not Issued; Passenger Plane to US Cancelled Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The China National Aviation Corporation's US-China route has been open for only a little over a month, but yesterday it was suddenly suspended. The reason is that the flights on this route were originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 1st and 16th of each month, but yesterday's flight did not take off. It is understood that the reason is that the operating permit applied for by the company to the US Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has not been issued due to various required bureaucratic procedures. In the past, the flights were operated with the consent of the US CAA under the nature of domestic government charter flights, but this time there were no government charter flights, so even if there were other passengers, it had to be cancelled in accordance with the regulations of the US CAA. The slowness of the US CAA in issuing permits is in stark contrast to the speed with which our Civil Aeronautics Administration approves permits for US airlines. Currently, our Civil Aeronautics Administration has sent a telegram to the US CAA urging them to expedite the process, and once approved, China National Aviation Corporation's US flights can resume as usual, it is said.</p>

The comfort funds will be donated by various industries. Also, because the Righteous Soldiers may stay in Shanghai for a short period of time, it was decided that the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Central Film Studio will arrange for the transportation and temporary accommodation of the Righteous Soldiers at Jiaotong University to screen movies.

<h3>Resolution to Establish Fundraising Committee for Relief of the Great Floods in Guangdong and Guangxi; Proposal to Request Issuance of Disaster Relief Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Bai Chongxi, Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Huang Shaohong, Wu Guozhen, and Huang Xuchu jointly invited leaders from all sectors of the city for consultation on the relief of the floods in Guangdong and Guangxi. They approved a request by the Guangdong and Guangxi Disaster Relief Committee to the Central Government to allow the issuance of "Disaster Relief Lottery Tickets." Once approved, the financial sector will purchase a portion of the tickets to meet urgent needs. It was also decided to establish a fundraising committee to ensure a unified command and make every effort to raise funds. Song Ziwen was elected as the chairman, and Wu Guobai, Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, and Xu Ji were elected as the vice-chairmen, with Wang Xianqing as the secretary-general. The fundraising committee members include Wang Zhengting, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Kaixian, Li Shuming, Li Yizhi, Xi Yanshu, Xu Xueyu, Wu Yunxu, Chen Bozhuang, Zhao Dihua, Cheng Cangbo, Yang Xiaotian, Qin Runqing, and others, totaling sixty-one people, and can be increased at any time if needed. The fundraising target for Shanghai is set at 50 billion yuan for Guangdong and 30 billion yuan for Guangxi. The detailed implementation methods will be determined after consultation between Song Ziwen and Du Yuesheng. The main points of yesterday's meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>The reception was held at the Imperial Palace on the 9th floor of the Jinmen Hotel at 3:00 PM, with more than 200 leaders from all walks of life attending. Bai Chongxi, Huang Shaohong, and Wu Guozhen represented the chairmen. Minister Bai first delivered a speech, hoping that leaders from all walks of life would study disaster relief measures to alleviate the suffering of the disaster victims in Guangdong and Guangxi, and thanked Mayor Wu for his assistance.</p>
<p>Mayor Encourages Generosity</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then spoke, saying that he had a feeling that although Shanghai's economy is depressed and life is difficult today, the citizens are actually living in a blessed land compared to the rest of the country. In the War of Resistance, Shanghai had its losses, but compared to the major cities in the rear that were bombed, it cannot be compared. In terms of wartime burden, Sichuan province alone had 1.6 million Sichuan soldiers, with an annual grain output of 20 million dan, which cannot be said to be light. In terms of the current situation, North China is a major battlefield, and Tianjin and Beijing are deeply affected, and their plight is even worse than Shanghai. South China has suffered the worst flood in thirty years. Based on the principles of disaster relief and neighborly assistance, Shanghai should be generous. Moreover, the floods in South China are also closely related to the economy of this city. Therefore, from a practical point of view, this city should also make every effort to help Guangdong and Guangxi.</p>
<p>Speaker of Guangdong Province Details Disaster Situation</p>
<p>After the mayor's speech, the presidium invited Lin Jizhong, the speaker of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly, who arrived in Shanghai the day before, to report on the disaster situation. Lin listed the numbers of losses and said that repairing the embankments is a matter of urgency, otherwise the coastal areas of Guangdong will be submerged again when the tide comes. The estimated repair cost is 30,000 tons of rice (labor relief) and 40 billion yuan (material costs). As for emergency relief, an Emergency Disaster Relief Committee has been established and has already distributed 80,000 dan of relief rice. In the future, when purchasing rice from Southeast Asia, it is hoped that the government will provide convenience in terms of foreign exchange. At the same time, in order to eradicate the floods in Guangdong and Guangxi, constructive water conservancy projects should be carried out, and this point still needs to be discussed with the Ministry of Water Conservancy.</p>
<p>Female Senator Reports on Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Wu Zhimei, a female senator from Guangdong, then reported on the disaster relief situation in Guangdong, saying that between June 21 and July 10, a total of about 14 billion yuan worth of in-kind donations and cash were received, and have been distributed to the disaster areas in Dongjiang, Xijiang, and Zhujiang. Currently, in addition to raising rice funds on their own in various counties and cities in Guangdong, representatives have also gone to Beijing to negotiate with the Central Government on the following matters: (1) The Executive Yuan should allocate 10 billion yuan for emergency relief, but only 3 billion yuan has been approved so far. (2) The 200,000 dan of grain requisitioned from Guangdong in 1946 should not be used for the time being in order to ensure emergency accounts. (3) Purchase 10,000 tons of grain from the United States, and ask the Central Government to approve the allocation of official price foreign exchange to save the victims. (4) Petition the Ministry of Food to reduce and exempt the land tax in the disaster areas. (5) Petition the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to allocate farming tools and fertilizers to the disaster areas. In terms of the disaster situation in Guangdong, emergency relief still requires 30,000 tons of food, otherwise 90 billion yuan will be needed.</p>
<p>Applause Passes List of Committee Members</p>
<p>After the two representatives from Guangdong reported on the disaster situation, Du Yuesheng immediately proposed the establishment of a fundraising committee, and the list of sixty-one committee members, including Song Ziwen, was passed by applause. Du also asked leaders from all walks of life to contribute fundraising methods. Luo Qinghua advocated issuing "Disaster Relief Lottery Tickets" to achieve long-term and widespread relief. He said: If 10 billion yuan is raised in one period, with 20% used as bonuses and expenses, 8 billion yuan can still be obtained. If this is done for five or six consecutive periods, it will not be difficult to achieve the goal. At the same time, this move can freeze the floating capital that is causing trouble and benefit the people of this city. Wang Xiaolai said: Disaster relief is like fighting a fire, and speed and timeliness are important. He advocated that the banking sector should advance funds first, and the funds raised in the future will be used to repay the loans. Based on past examples, this method is very feasible. Whether this move is successful depends entirely on the degree of effort.</p>
<p>The Two Provinces Need 800 Billion for Emergency Accounts</p>
<p>Wang Xianqing and Zhang Kanglong spoke, saying that they had visited Song Ziwen to discuss this matter, and Guangdong needs 500 billion yuan for emergency relief, hoping to raise 50 billion yuan in Shanghai; Guangxi needs 300 billion yuan for emergency relief, hoping to raise 30 billion yuan in Shanghai.

<h3>Scalpers Buying Up Sugar Ration Coupons: Social Affairs Bureau Considers Raising Sugar Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] Because of the large number of customers applying for sugar rations, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation recently extended the ration period to once every two weeks, instead of weekly, to simplify procedures, with the ration quantity equaling the total amount rationed in two periods. The 24th sugar ration will be distributed next Thursday. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday: "The ration price for household sugar this period is 2,500 yuan per catty, while the black market price is 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per catty. Scalpers are offering to buy up ration coupons, which has caused the price of sugar ration coupons to rise on the market." The rationing plan was originally intended for the welfare of citizens, but now it has given scalpers an opportunity to manipulate the market, which is a great loss to the country and a blow to those who handle rationing.

<h3>Education Symposium Opens Yesterday: Elects Zheng Xiaocang and Six Others to Form Basic Education Design Committee; Approves Five Points of Mr. Slev's Proposed Social Education Plan</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Nanjing, 16th] The Ministry of Education's Education Issues Symposium held a general meeting on the morning of the 16th, chaired by Zhu Jiahua, and gathered reports from various review groups. Common opinions were reached as follows: (1) The high school graduation uniform examination system seems to have more advantages than disadvantages. The system itself has its value, but due to current transportation obstacles, economic difficulties, and schools not yet returning to normal, it seems appropriate to postpone implementation temporarily. In the future, strict enforcement of invigilation and spot-check methods should be implemented to improve the performance of schools and students, and the assessment of physical education and conduct should be strengthened. (2) It is reasonable for normal school students to be trained by the state and to serve the state for a certain number of years after graduation, but it seems inappropriate to restrict young people with excellent performance and a desire to pursue further education after serving their term. (3) Improve the organization of student self-government associations, strengthen the spirit of democracy, and emphasize the training of young people's character in the guidance work of teachers. Excellent students should be rewarded to encourage leadership, and individual guidance should be given to mischievous students to promote their correction. In addition to possessing the qualifications stipulated by law, the selection of principals must involve selecting people with rich teaching or administrative experience, excellent character, and a reputation in the local education field. Grade-level teachers must recognize the personalities of all students and manage and train students separately, with heavy responsibilities. Their teaching time should be reduced by six to eight hours to allow time for guidance work. Full-time teachers should work in the school for no less than seven hours to fully exert the spirit of professionalism and the responsibility of guiding young people. (4) Regarding basic education issues, Zheng Xiaocang, Luo Tingguang, and six others were elected to form a Basic Education Design Committee. After the end of the Education Symposium, experts will continue to be invited to discuss a basic education plan suitable for China's national conditions. The conference fully agreed to the following five points of the "China Social Education Plan" proposed by American Mr. Slev: (1) To make China a modern democratic country in a very short time, it is necessary to start with the implementation of adult education and the elimination of illiteracy. (2) The implementation of this education requires national mobilization. (3) Seek as much international material and technical assistance as possible. (4) The implementation of social education should be in line with the national political, social, and economic situation and needs. (5) Establish a committee to be responsible for planning and promoting this education. The conference finally opened in a harmonious atmosphere.</p>
<h3>High School Graduate Training: To Be Held in Six Regions Next Year; Authorities Are Now Actively Preparing</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Nanjing, 16th] It is learned that high school graduate training will be held next year, and the responsible authorities are actively starting to prepare as follows: (1) Surveying the number of high school graduates nationwide. This year, there are approximately 94,401 people, and next year, there will be approximately 120,000 people. (2) Collecting districts. According to traffic conditions and the distribution of schools and students, the country will be divided into six districts, with one city in each district serving as the training institution. (3) The education plan will be implemented in three stages, including two months of basic training, three months of non-commissioned officer training, and five months of officer training, plus two months for collection and demobilization time. The total training period is one year.</p>
<h3>Municipal Elementary School Repair Fees: To Be Collected at the Beginning of the Semester; Director Gu Tells Reporter</h3>
<p>[Our Paper's Report] Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, has returned to Shanghai from Nanjing and told reporters yesterday that the issue of tuition fees for private elementary and middle schools in the city next semester has not yet been agreed upon by the principals. Due to price fluctuations, it may not be decided until August. After receiving the standards agreed upon by the principals, the Education Bureau will sign its opinion and submit it to the Municipal Government for submission to the Municipal Council for approval.</p>
<p>Regarding the collection of fees for municipal elementary schools next semester, the principals of municipal elementary schools hope to charge each student 120,000 yuan for repair fees. After repeated discussions, the Education Bureau has now stipulated that the maximum should not exceed 80,000 yuan, to be collected at the beginning of the semester. Impoverished students and children of public school teachers and staff can apply for reductions or exemptions according to law.

<h3>Tight Money Supply and Shifting Market Sentiment - General Price Decline in This City - Business and Industrial Circles Concerned About the Export of National Products</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The general market conditions for commodities in this city have recently seen a widespread downward trend due to (1) a tight money supply, (2) the visit of U.S. envoy Wedemeyer to China, and (3) the U.S. State Department's plan to open up trade with Japan. Yesterday, the trend was more pronounced across the board. Among the most significant examples: stock prices generally declined. 20-count Double Horse yarn was at 10 million yuan, a decrease of 900,000 yuan from before. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was at 17.2 million yuan, a decrease of 1.5 million yuan from before. Fine-count yarn has largely fallen into the range of negotiated prices. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was at 428,000 yuan, a decrease of 17,000 yuan from before. White Jing rice was at 390,000 yuan, a decrease of 5,000 yuan from before. Qingdao raw peanut oil was at 770,000 yuan, a decrease of 40,000 yuan from before. 120-count Tianqiao rayon was at 26.7 million yuan, a decrease of 900,000 yuan from before. Grade 78D factory silk was at 31.5 million, lacking buyers. Apart from cigarettes, which have stopped declining and are trending upwards due to the passing of the foggy season and the adjustment of commodity taxes on July 26, other commodities are generally declining, which is a welcome phenomenon amid the continuous price increases of recent months.</p>
<p>The tight money supply is due to the large deficits of national banks. On Monday, the deficit was 50.3 billion yuan, on Tuesday, it was 38.2 billion yuan, and only yesterday did it show a surplus of 17.7 billion yuan. The money supply remained tight yesterday morning, but the Bank of China's surplus of over 36 billion yuan in the afternoon gradually eased the situation. However, national banks still had a deficit of 16.9 billion yuan, foreign banks had a deficit of 10.9 billion yuan, clearing houses before No. 50 had a deficit of 21.8 billion yuan, and those after No. 50 had a surplus of 15 billion yuan. When the money supply was extremely tight a few days ago, some clearing houses had to balance their accounts late into the night. As a result, the preparatory committee of the money and banking industry also had a deficit of over 7 billion yuan a few days ago, but yesterday it was only over 1 billion yuan. The black market interest rate was between 22% and 23%.</p>
<p>In addition, the general impression of Wedemeyer's visit to China is one of optimism regarding future loans. It is believed that Wedemeyer's trip will facilitate loan progress. Furthermore, after the opening of trade with Japan, MacArthur's headquarters will adopt export subsidy policies, and the general labor costs in Japan are much lower than in China. Therefore, business and industrial circles in this city are concerned about the future of national product exports. As a result, they are selling off the goods they hold. This is also a major reason for the recent decline in commodity prices.</p>
<h3>Tight Money Supply, Decline in Hua Shares - Xinhe's Capital Increase Revealed, Market First Hit Limit Down</h3>
<p>Except for Jinglun, which rose slightly, and Xinya National Products, which remained flat, all other popular Hua shares and miscellaneous brands fell sharply yesterday. The more popular shares fell more, due to the tight money supply and accumulated selling pressure, making it difficult for those shorting to obtain supplies. Xinhe's capital increase plan, which involved giving 11 bonus shares (two of which were allocated from interest) and requiring the purchase of 12 shares, shattered many dreams and first hit the limit down. On the last day of trading, buyers also showed no interest in Shuisazhi, and it also fell near the close, showing a bearish outlook.</p>
<p>The market opened lower in the morning due to the large deficits of national banks during the previous day's clearing. After opening, Luyong Yarn fell from 10,100 yuan to 9,600 yuan. No. 97, No. 220, No. 226, No. 180, and No. 177 advanced to 9,880 yuan, while No. 197, No. 154, and No. 54 were sold again to 9,650 yuan. No. 218, No. 220, No. 45, No. 82, and No. 236 advanced to 9,990 yuan. No. 97, No. 223, No. 220, No. 235, and No. 112 still had supply, further pushing Luyong Yarn down to within 9,700 yuan. After 10:45 AM, buying interest recovered, and No. 224, No. 2, No. 157, No. 35, No. 97, No. 4, No. 85, No. 56, No. 152, No. 220, and others came in, briefly pushing Luyong Yarn up to 9,970 yuan. No. 35, No. 171, No. 89, No. 91, and No. 235 were sold, retreating to 9,700 yuan, while No. 219 and No. 218 advanced to outside 9,800 yuan. The Xinhe shareholders' meeting ended, and the disappointing bonus shares caused a collapse, indirectly affecting the entire stock market. Luyong Yarn was liquidated by No. 76, No. 217, No. 213, No. 155, No. 23, No. 17, No. 213, No. 155, No. 23, No. 180, No. 183, and No. 226, while No. 171 also sold Luyong Yarn, and Xinhe was heavily shorted. No. 181 and No. 45 also appeared on the market. At 12:15 PM, Xinhe first hit the limit down, and Yong Yarn entered 9,400 yuan, while now Yong Yarn also reached a low price of 9,350 yuan. No. 85 and No. 104 took advantage of the low price to advance to outside 5,500 yuan, but due to the consistent decline in various commodity prices and rumors of short selling, No. 85, No. 235, No. 181, No. 102, and No. 65 sold again, and No. 15 bought the current Yong Yarn on a broad scale. At 12:25 PM, Yong Yarn was forced to the limit down, and the current Yong Yarn also fell to within 9,300 yuan. No. 68, No. 91, and No. 16 still had to make up positions, rising to 9,380 yuan. No. 65, No. 54, and No. 215 sold off, and the market closed at 9,320 yuan. After the close, No. 157, No. 50, No. 69, No. 154, and No. 116 advanced, bidding up to outside 9,400 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, both traded shares of Xinguang, Yonggong, Dongxing, Zhongfa fell by a little over 5%, while Yong Yarn, Xinhe, Meiya, and Xinhua fell by about 10%, and Huafeng fell by a little over 10%. Only Jinglun rose slightly, while underwear was slightly weak, and Xinya National Products and Lian remained flat. Wuhe Matches, Datong Business, and Zhongsi fell by 5%, while Tongyi, Rongfeng, and Yongni each fell by 10%. In traded shares, Hua continued to fall by 5%, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Meiya each fell by a little over 5%, Yonggong and Qinxing fell by a little less than 10%, and Yong Yarn and Xinhe fell to the limit down and then recovered, falling by a little less than 10% and 15%. In old shares traded over the counter, Zhonghua, Zhabei, Nanyang, and Wuzhou declined slightly, while the rest were flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Stable, Foreign Shares Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Government bonds were slightly stable yesterday, with Class C and E bonds rising slightly, while miscellaneous brands fell slightly. Unified Class C opened at 6,900 yuan, reached 6,600 yuan, and closed at 7,000 yuan. Room 555 came in, while Room 503 and Runde sold. As a result, compared to the previous close, Class A and B bonds fell by 100 yuan, Unified Class D fell by 200 yuan, Unified Class C rose by 200 yuan, and Unified Class E also rose by 300 yuan. The trading volume was about 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign shares continued to decline yesterday due to reduced stimulation and a decline in off-site materials, showing a weak trend. Yisza opened at 69,000 yuan and closed at 67,000 yuan. Retail investors and money changers accepted the decline, while securities firms and banks provided supply. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yeguang was still flat, while Yipi, Yinglian, Steel Industry, and Aviation each fell by a little over 5%, the Paper Industry fell by a little less than 10%, and the remaining shares fell by anywhere from a slight decline to a little less than 5%.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Yarn Allocation</h3>

<h3>Three District Silk Industry Association Holds Fifth Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors - Discusses Requesting Cash Allotments for Raw Silk</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The Fifth Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of the Third District Raw Silk Industry Association was held yesterday afternoon starting at 3:00 PM at the Bank Club. Over 20 people attended, including Chu Zhuan-cheng, Wang Hua-nan, Ge Jing-zhong, and Cai Xin-tao, chaired by Chu Zhuan-cheng. Mr. Chu first reported on the general situation of the association's affairs over the past year, with key points including: (1) 112 current members. (2) The purchase of raw silk during the spring and autumn rainy seasons of the 35th year of the Republic [1946]. (3) The spring loan work of the 36th year of the Republic [1947]. (4) The request to the government regarding the Japanese, Dutch, and Mixed China cases. (5) Tax issues. (6) The association's financial situation. (7) Reports of silk factory losses.</p>
<p>Following this, six proposals were discussed, of which the two most important are recorded below: (1) The association previously submitted requests to the Executive Yuan and the four joint offices, strongly arguing that each factory should be allowed to allocate raw silk in proportion to its own 10% capital and 10% profit, or to only pay 80% and retain 20% of the raw silk to regulate the market. Now it is known that the four joint offices have telegraphed the Guidance Association, stating that the government should buy all of the raw silk and not retain part for self-sale, requesting discussion. After discussion, it was resolved: to form another small group of eight people, including Zhou Yuan-xun, Wang Hua-nan, Gu Su-ming, Yuan Da-yi, Lu Zhong-lie, Gao Jing-yue, Du Lian-fu, and Zhang En-sheng, to discuss the solution at the afternoon of the 18th, and to represent the association at the Sericulture Production and Marketing Guidance Committee meeting on the 19th for discussion. All of the attending directors and supervisors considered that the 10% capital of each factory at that time was mostly raised by selling raw silk. The legal profit of 10% should also be given in goods in order to provide working capital. Otherwise, each silk factory's silk needs will be difficult to meet. (2) The Lianyuan Silk Factory proposal: Spring spinning has been completed for a month, and factories are hoping to start production soon, and the prerequisite is: (A) Requesting the Guidance Association to adopt a generous and flexible approach to the payment of spinning fees for half a month to provide working capital. (B) Fuel allocation is feared to be difficult, requesting the Guidance Association to negotiate with the Agricultural Bank of China to allocate funds to purchase all of the coal and fuel oil needed by the silk factories for one month at market prices, and instruct the Agricultural Bank of China branches in the localities of each factory to issue them for use by the factories, requesting discussion. The resolution was passed, to be submitted to the Guidance Association for adoption and implementation.</p>

<p>The factory management market has been quiet for days, and yesterday's price was reported to be low, with the asking price for high uniformity 500,000 yuan less than the previous day, but there were still few buyers and no transactions. Retail transaction prices were about 1 million yuan less than the previous day, with medium-grade goods between 29 million and 30 million yuan, and high-grade retail goods between 30.5 million and 100 million yuan, with very little business being done. The asking price for dried silk was also down by 500,000 yuan yesterday.</p>
<p>Silk merchants are very apprehensive due to the continued weakness of raw materials, so prices have fallen across the board. Dachen quilted fabric was first offered at 1.4 million yuan, but after large households sold off, the transaction price was 340,000 and 330,000 yuan. The final price fell to 300,000 yuan. Huaqiang quilted fabric fell from 350,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan, and finally someone wanted it at 250,000 yuan. Dachen checkered crepe opened at 36,4500 yuan, and finally traded at 6,200 yuan, with a delayed date of 6,500 yuan. The afternoon market price of Hua Jin crepe fell by 1,000 yuan, with the transaction price for high-end goods at 24,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>More Supply Than Demand in the Market - Yarn and Cloth Continue to Plummet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a surge in supply from the Shenxin Factory and the opening of sales by the Textile Construction Company. The money supply in the market remained tight, and a bearish sentiment permeated the market. With rumors of the imminent success of US loans, people's hearts were extremely distracted, new buyers hesitated, and the closing price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was as low as 17.2 million, which was tens of thousands lower than the opening price of the Textile Construction Company, a huge drop of 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The closing price for 20-count Special Double Horse yarn also fell to 11.2 million, a gradual decline of 800,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn was at 10 million yuan, down 900,000 yuan. The remaining 42-count Water Moon Treasure Light, 40-count Jincheng, 32-count Blue Phoenix Silver Moon, 20-count Tiannv Renzhong, 16-count Guangming, and 10-count Boy Scout and other coarse and fine yarns all fell by 340,000 to 1.1 million yuan each.</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw a gradual tightening of credit loans by banks, and traders' positions were tight. A bearish sentiment enveloped the market, and prices fell gradually. The resulting price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was as low as 418,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 27,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Fine cloths of various grades, such as Five Blessings Color Ball, Blue Chicken, and Yanghe, also fell by 22,000 to 30,000 yuan across the board. The remaining bleached cloth, fine cloth, and dyed cloth Shilin cloth also fell by 5,000 to 25,000 yuan each, while grey cloth and coarse cloth fell very little.</p>
<h3>Cotton Textile Industry Joint Venture Company Holds First Deliberation Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] The China Cotton Textile Industry Production and Sales Joint Venture Company, in order to export cotton textiles to Southeast Asia and secure foreign exchange revenue, had its chairman, Mr. Xu Wenzhao, send Deputy Chairman Fu Liangjun, General Manager Qian Chengxu, and Deputy Manager Lu Baoqing to Beijing three times. With the special permission of the authorities, they attended the National Economic Conference held on the 12th of this month. With the strong support of the attending committee members, it was approved in principle, opening the first sound of government assistance to national industries. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the company held its first deliberation meeting, chaired by Fu Liangjun. The attending participants included the chief committee members of six units, including shirts, undershirts, knitwear, handkerchiefs, bedsheets, and towels: Mr. Wang [missing character], Yao Siwei, Luo Qingfan, Xu Zhaohou, and over 20 people including the company's executive director Li Daofa. Chairman Fu reported in great detail on the experience of attending the National Economic Conference in Beijing and expressed his gratitude to the government's leadership and assistance. He mentioned that although the authorities had approved it in principle, technical issues still needed to be carefully studied. The authorities' opinion was that "standard products come first," and he hoped that everyone would work hard to increase production in order to fulfill the government's premise of revitalizing industry and conforming to the new economic direction.</p>
<p>The content of the deliberation meeting reportedly focused on recognizing "seizing the opportunity," "determining costs," "quantity allocation," "inventory reporting," "profit," and "production and sales contracts," with lengthy discussions, especially on the production and sales cooperation contract, which was thoroughly reviewed and unanimously passed. The meeting adjourned at 8:00 PM, and Fu will convene another important meeting within days.</p>
<p>A certain authoritative person in the city's economic circles commented on this matter, saying: "If China's cotton textile industry can receive the full support of the government, the benefits will be immeasurable, and the national economy's prosperity will be promising. If the government can provide all conveniences in the technical aspects, early exports will be as easy as turning one's hand."</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Allocation Period Extended - Changed to Once Every Two Weeks - Each Allocation Increased by One Fold Compared to Before</h3>
<p>The Taiwan Sugar Company, due to the large number of customers for the allocation and sale of sugar, previously allocated and sold sugar once a week, which caused many difficulties in the procedures. Therefore, the original plan to apply for sugar allocation today has now decided to extend the allocation period and change it to once every two weeks. Each allocation will be increased by one fold compared to before, and the 24th period will be changed to applying for allocation and sale next Thursday.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian stated yesterday: "Recently, the bureau received a report from the Taiwan Sugar Company stating that the difference between the household sugar allocation price and the market price has reached 5,000 yuan per catty, resulting in active scalper parties. The sugar ticket already has a market price, and the bureau is requested to consider this. However, the bureau believes that it would be too demanding to require the sugar to be shown the citizens' identity card in addition to the sugar ticket. It is now planned to increase the allocation price for August to about 5,000 yuan per catty in order to prevent market scalpers from profiting. Although suppressing the sugar price is the most thorough solution, it cannot be implemented due to the fluctuating Taiwan dollar exchange rate."</p>
<p>Sugar Prices Continue to Fall</p>
<p>The sugar market continued to decline yesterday due to the tight money supply. The association's price quotes, Taiwan sugar three grades with extra, the initial price was 65,000 yuan, then fell to 60,000 and 50,000 yuan. 20 Medium sand white 634,000 yuan, Taiwan red 565,000 yuan. Peruvian sand 680,000 yuan, each falling by about 20,000 yuan. In the afternoon, each grade fell by another 10,000 yuan. Native sugar was also generally weak, Shantou Green 460,000 yuan to 456,000 yuan, Cotton Red 510,000 yuan, Xinghua White high-grade goods 610,000 yuan, second-grade 590,000 yuan. Xing red 465,000 yuan, second-grade 434,000 yuan, Hainan red 460,000 yuan, totaling over 500 transactions.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Tax Rate Adjusted - Changed to 100 Percent</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has decided to implement an adjustment to the cigarette tax rate, generally increasing it to 100 percent, starting from the 26th. It is said that the collection method will adopt a rounding system of fifty, in order to uniformly align with units of ten yuan. For example, if the original tax rate was 210,000 yuan, an increase of 100 percent would be 420,000 yuan, but only 400,000 yuan will be paid. And those above 450,000 yuan will be calculated as 500,000 yuan. The tax bureau has officially notified the above method to all cigarette factories for their information.</p>
<p>Cigarettes Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market saw a lively increase in activity from the door and broker gangs, coupled with a sharp drop in prices on the previous day, leading to buying to cover short positions, and the market trend remained firm. Trading in the noon market was still good, but the money supply remained tight, and the Huacheng Company dispatched sales of Beauty brand cigarettes: A card one box, B card forty packs, C card twenty packs, allocation price 47,500 yuan per pack.</p>
<p>The China Company will also dispatch (17th) A-grade Tongxing Double Axe brand cigarettes one box, Quanlu one box, B-grade 150 packs each, C-grade 100 packs. The allocation price for Double Axe is 24,000 yuan per pack, and Quanlu is 13,200 yuan, so the resulting price rise was thwarted.</p>
<p>Both Ten Branches British Old Knife cigarettes only rose by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day, with British at 8,520,000 and Old Knife at 7,380,000 yuan. The remaining Chinese manufacturer's Golden Mouse, Million Gold, Brandy Red Gold medal, and other packaged cigarettes also increased by 4500 to 1200 yuan. However, the market for American goods Camel, Mars packaged cigarettes, and canned tobacco remained stable.</p>
<h3>Measures to Participate in Trade with Japan to be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>[Reported by this Newspaper] Since the US State Department announced that it would restore the opening of trade with Japan in mid-August of this year, various countries have been contacting each other to establish trade relations with Japan. Our country has been approved by the Southeast Committee to have 64 import and export merchants send representatives to Japan to handle commercial affairs. The central authorities, in order to discuss the promotion of private trade relations between our country and Japan, requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs to preside over the matter at the National Economic Committee meeting. It is now learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has convened various related parties to discuss it once, and detailed measures are expected to be announced within days.</p>
<p>[Another News] In the barter trade with Japan handled by the Central Trust Bureau, the quota for food exports to Japan from our country this year has reached 500,000 tons. It is now learned that to date, 200,000 tons of food have already been shipped, and whether the remaining 300,000 tons can be fully shipped will depend on future transportation conditions.</p>
<h3>"Industry and Commerce World" Seventh Issue Published</h3>
<p>The seventh issue of "Industry and Commerce World," published by Pan Shizao and edited by Yuan Bili, was published yesterday. In addition to the special issue "Is the Recent Employee Living Index Reasonable?", this issue also includes several important papers such as Li Zongwen's "Re-discussing Import and Export Interlocking Measures" and Pan Shihao's "New Voices on Textile Allocation."</p>
<h3>Yarn Business Association Representatives Petition for Resumption of Yarn Allocation to Silk Weavers</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Tang Zhiliang, Chairman of the Shanghai Yarn Business Association, along with directors Shen Boqin and Xi Shaozun, visited Liu Siying, acting chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, at around 3 p.m. yesterday.  Mr. Liu was busy with official duties, so Yuan Cuda, director of the secretariat of the committee, received them.  Since the cessation of yarn allocation by the company, the silk weavers have relied on yarn supplied by various private factories.  Now, because 75% of the yarn produced by the private factories is to be turned over to the government, the yarn available for sale is even scarcer, making it impossible for yarn merchants to maintain their businesses.  There are more than 800 yarn businesses in this city, employing over 10,000 people, whose livelihoods are at risk.  Furthermore, small industries in other cities have always relied on yarn merchants for supply and distribution, and now have nowhere to turn.  Therefore, in order to regulate yarn market surpluses and deficits, and to sustain the yarn merchants' businesses, they request the resumption of yarn allocation.  Mr. Yuan stated that the issue of yarn allocation to yarn merchants is already stipulated in the Textile Adjustment Committee's implementation plan, which is awaiting approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs before it can be implemented. Currently, yarn merchants are advised to temporarily maintain their businesses by relying on the limited yarn allocated by private factories.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was weak due to the decline in yarn and cloth prices and tight credit conditions, leading to a further drop in prices. Trading of opened and delivered bales was recorded at 2.15 million for Lingshi, 2.05 million for Shanghai City, 1.7 million for Huoji, and 320,000 per bundle for Zhoupu Zihua cotton.</p>
<h3>Revised Measures for the Purchase of Hog Bristles and Tung Oil</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] According to information from the China National Trust and Investment Corporation (CNTIC), the implementation measures for the purchase of hog bristles and tung oil have been newly revised and are currently under review by the Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Council. It is expected to be announced soon. Furthermore, the CNTIC's purchase of aged tea from the 35th year of the Republic has not yet commenced because tea merchants are still in negotiations with the Central Bank and the China Farmers Bank regarding unresolved matters.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil Smuggled South Reaches Thousands of Large Barrels</h3>
<p>It has recently been discovered that edible oil is being smuggled from this city to Guangzhou and Hong Kong, with the quantity reaching over 3,000 large barrels (53 gallons per barrel). The Bureau of Social Affairs has conducted extensive investigations, but has not yet made any arrests. The bureau has requested the City Government to inquire with the Customs, but Customs has not issued any permits for such shipments as the matter is under control, leading to speculation of smuggling. The Bureau of Social Affairs has requested assistance from relevant authorities to investigate the matter.</p>
<h3>Temporary Allocation of 20,000 Bales, Allocation Price Unlikely to Change; Cotton Provided by Private Factories to be Settled at Negotiated Price First, then Allocated to Reproduction Industry by Textile Adjustment Committee</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The sixth regular meeting of the Textile Adjustment Committee will be held at the committee at 4 p.m. today. At the meeting, the final wording of the implementation plan for developing the textile industry and adjusting the yarn and cloth market, which was passed at the fifth regular meeting, will be revised before being submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. It is reported that since the government issued the general mobilization order, the coordination of this plan has been complicated, requiring the Ministry to submit it to the National Overall Planning Committee of the Executive Yuan for joint discussion before a proper solution can be determined.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the temporary joint allocation handled by the committee, state-owned and private yarn factories are each to provide 10,000 bales of cotton yarn for allocation before the 15th of this month. The 10,000 bales provided by the state-owned factories are almost fully allocated. However, the private factories have not yet delivered the full amount, with only over 8,000 bales delivered so far. It is reported that relevant parties intend to allocate these 20,000 bales of cotton yarn within this week to avoid changes in negotiated prices affecting the fairness of the joint allocation system for each factory. Factories that deliver yarn late will have their yarn settled at the current negotiated price and sold to the Textile Adjustment Committee, which will then allocate it to the reproduction industry at the current negotiated price. Therefore, the allocation price of the 20,000 bales of temporarily allocated yarn is expected to remain unchanged.</p>

<h3>Battle Flags Flutter on Taiping Ridge, North Suburb of Siping</h3>
<p>— Yu Juren</p>
<p>Changchun, 11th (Air Mail)</p>
<p>In the northern suburbs of Siping, there are two adjacent high grounds marked on the map as "Liuping Ridge." Some people call them "Sister Mountains." It is a strategically important location, as it controls the entire Siping, which is extremely critical. No wonder General Du Yuming, even on his sickbed, constantly thinks about the construction there and repeatedly tells his chief of staff, Zhao Jia, to call and inquire about the defense situation. The fortifications there were built strongly by the defending army. The Communist army made several probing attacks, but always retreated when they realized the difficulty.</p>
<p>This is a factual article written by a military personnel participating in the defense war in that area (Reader).</p>
<p>A Pleasant Dream</p>
<p>At the end of May, the wind warms the lake and the earth, and everything in the north begins to regenerate. The flood tide of the Songhua River, stirred by the Arctic currents, begins to flood again. Look! Like the high tide of the Qiantang River, it moves from north of the river southward, southward… The northern embankment has lost its resistance. People living in this gentle land begin to feel depressed. The train station is filled with refugees, and the streets have lost their order. The retreating soldiers and refugees from the south are like a tide, and everyone's heart is shaken!</p>
<p>It was on the morning of May 25th that an express train came from the west. The whistle joyfully told the people in their troubled dreams the good news: "Reinforcements from the west have arrived!" This is the vanguard of the 261st Regiment of the 87th Division. They are the mainstay of the defense of Siping, leading thousands of brave men. The commander of this valiant force is Colonel Zhou Junping, with Lieutenant Colonel Wang Yubai as the deputy commander. The name "261st Regiment" is no longer unfamiliar to the people of Northeast China.</p>
<p>With neat ranks, they marched through the streets. Who wouldn't cast a joyful and admiring glance at this solemn and orderly procession? They marched from the station, group by group, to their defensive positions. This built an impregnable wall of stability for the people of Siping, who were in turmoil.</p>
<p>On Full Alert</p>
<p>No matter who judged the situation in Siping at the time, the north was more important than the south. Therefore, this important area was taken over by the 261st Regiment of the 87th Division. They occupied a total of approximately 5,500 meters of defensive positions from the source of the northeast water supply to Xiaobeigou in the northwest. In this area, they used the undulating ridges of Beishan as outposts, and created resistance lines around the city's perimeter. They also used the [omission] as the third line of defense. Behind the third line of defense, the command posts formed strong strongholds. Thus, in this vast area, a complex and intricate "Eight Trigrams Formation" was created, integrating points, lines, and surfaces. Due to their consistent efforts from top to bottom, they built an incredibly strong defensive work in a very short period.</p>
<p>When you stand on Beishan and look south, the high and long walls, the winding trenches, the star-studded fortresses, the layers of barbed wire, the barricades, and the honeycomb-like triangular pits… it evokes a sense of impossibility to enter. Furthermore, the energetic soldiers with guns and the new-style weapons with bright bayonets are truly indescribably majestic and solemnly awe-inspiring. They are waiting in full battle array.</p>
<p>A Prelude to Victory</p>
<p>The curtain of the great battle was raised, accompanied by the Communist army’s lightning attack on the third stronghold of Beishan in the south, which fired the first shot! This was the westernmost outpost battle of the 261st Regiment, defended by the thirty-seven brave men led by Platoon Leader Wang Zhenshan of the 6th Company of the 2nd Battalion, guarding the northern gate of Siping.</p>
<p>Everyone worried about the battle at this isolated outpost. The first battle passed, and the next day was the same. On the third day, the Communist army attacked most fiercely. They used a battalion-sized force, and as a result, the Communist battalion was completely defeated. More than 1,500 people were wiped out, creating this prelude to victory!</p>
<p>Lightning Attacks</p>
<p>The Communist army's lightning attacks in the southern urban area had clearly broken through some positions, infiltrated the urban area, and reached near Yuming Road, with a momentum like the "Yellow River flood," seemingly unstoppable.</p>
<p>Deputy Commander Lieutenant Colonel Wang Yubai was ordered to command in this precarious situation. He led two and a half companies of his unit, along with an attached platoon of infantry and engineers, using this limited force to block the Communist army's advance on Yuming Road. They captured two strongholds with one stroke. Although the Communist army approached with ten times the strength, they launched fierce attacks day and night. The street battles lasted three days and nights, but they never crossed the boundary by even one step.</p>
<p>A Good Beating</p>
<p>After the 261st Regiment moved its position, the entire deployment formed a "U" shape, with the 2nd Battalion at the railway repair factory as the protruding point on the right wing of the "U," and the 3rd Battalion at Tianqiao (Sky Bridge) as the protruding point on the left. In such a position, attackers who do not first attack both wings, or break one wing, before attacking the central concave part of the "U," are absolutely not allowed. The Communist army recklessly attempted to use extremely superior forces to cross the railway from the west side and attack the concave part of the "U" shape, attempting a central breakthrough. Therefore, on the third night (June 21st) after their attack on the railway repair factory failed, the entire 1st Brigade, approximately 4,000 men, attacked the 1st Battalion guarding the concave part of the "U" formation at Dechang Industrial Company. The Communist army was certainly taking a pre-requisitve calculated risk by attempting a central breakthrough. The so-called pre-conditions were nothing more than having absolute superiority in strength and firepower compared to the defenders.</p>
<p>Undeniably, the battle was truly intense. The Communist army used the wheel warfare tactic, charging repeatedly. If one attack failed, they would launch another. "Charge! Kill! Crash! Dudu!" The shouts, artillery fire, and bugle calls were deafening. Fireballs, fire clusters, and fire lines were colorful and dazzling. It was truly a tragic scene. At the fiercest moment of the battle, the brave Deputy Commander Wang Yubai personally led a platoon of infantry to Dechang Company to supervise the battle, vowing not to let the Communist army break into the position. The resourceful Commander Zhou Junping also telegraphed orders to the units on both wings of the "U" formation to preemptively create a "fire pocket" for the Communist army, and ordered the 2nd Battalion to be ready to strike from the right wing to annihilate the attacking Communist army in front of the position in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>The Communist army's misfortune finally descended upon them. The attack was unsuccessful, and before dawn, they had to retreat quickly. Who knew that a "only allow them to advance but not retreat" interlocking fire was waiting for them. As they prepared to cross the railway, more than a dozen light and heavy machine guns on both wings of the "U" formation sealed off a corridor more than 20 meters wide on both sides of the railway, making it impenetrable. Forward? It was a steel wall-like position. Stop? It was a nest of arrows focused in one place. They had to rush back, braving the rain of bullets. They ran backward in dense ball formation. Our side used intense artillery fire to pour down, and the bullets washed over like a river collapsing. People fell down row by row like sand embankments, followed by the appearance of armored vehicles. It was truly "a good beating!" The complete annihilation of the Communist army's 1st Brigade truly manifested a new destiny.</p>
<p>Smoke-Shrouded Sky Bridge</p>
<p>The Sky Bridge (Tianqiao) is the left protruding part of the "U" formation of the 261st Regiment and is the traffic artery connecting east and west Daodong. Located high and protruding, it naturally forms the outpost of the entire stronghold in Daodong. Whether it is to the south or to the north, it can exert flanking firepower and suppress the activities of the Communist army in Daoxi. No wonder the Communist army regarded it as a "thorn in their side" and wanted to dislodge this "thorn."</p>
<p>The Communist army once launched a decisive attack on it with the main force of the entire 7th Brigade (16th Division). The style of attack was nothing more than "fierce." Almost every officer and soldier of the 261st Regiment knew these three movements: "Fierce attack" (artillery bombardment) at dusk, "Charge" at night, and "Fierce retreat" at dawn. Therefore, their countermeasure was "strict alert," "short and fierce shooting," and "relentless pursuit of firepower." As a result, every time the Communist army attacked, they enriched their victory with more content. The Communist army's attack on the bridge was, of course, another failure.</p>
<p>Sky Bridge, great goddess, although your true face is shrouded in smoke and your jade body is bathed in a rain of bullets, you remain safe and sound in this storm. As the wind blows away the smoke from all directions, your image reappears greatly and majestic.</p>
<p>The Highest Peak of Jigong Mountain: Profile of Jigongtou (Sent by Our Correspondent Zhou Hanxun)</p>
<h3>Jigong Mountain, a Summer Resort in Central China</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Zhou Handong</p>
<p>Hankou, 11th (Air Mail)</p>
<p>Invited by the Pinghan Railway Bureau, the reporter unintentionally visited Jigong Mountain, a famous summer resort! The development of this famous mountain only began around the 30th year of Guangxu (1904). It has no historical sites and lacks clear streams. In terms of history, scenery, landscape, and coolness, it cannot compare with Guling. However, from the perspective of the current geographical environment and future transportation construction, it has unique and majestic qualities, making it a summer resort most worthy of creation.</p>
<p>Magnificent Terrain and a Must-Contend Military Location</p>
<p>Jigong Mountain is located about 30 li north of Wusheng Pass and belongs to the branch of the Dabie Mountain Range. It is about 2,500 meters above sea level. If Wusheng Pass is an iron gate on the Pinghan Line protecting Wuhan, then Jigong Mountain is the outpost of this iron gate. Therefore, it has become a must-contend military location in the past. General Wu Peifu's success or failure was greatly influenced by its blessings or abandonments!</p>
<p>The highest peak of the mountain is regarded as the rooster's head and comb. It raises its neck and stands as the watershed between Henan and Hubei provinces, as if it is surveying the surroundings and detecting everything. On the rooster's back, tail, and feet, secluded and winding mountain streams are interspersed with several solid bunkers, further showing its majestic posture, which is overlooking and inviolable!</p>
<p>The rooster is male, and Jigong Mountain also has its magnificence!</p>
<p>Enjoying a Ride and Climbing the Mountain with Flying Delight</p>
<p>"Traveling and escaping the summer heat requires a leisurely mood. Perhaps we cannot fully appreciate the beauty of the mountain scenery!" An industry colleague once had such feelings.</p>
<p>When we walked out of the station and ascended along the small mountain path, we naturally felt a refreshing and hopeful longing when we saw the plaque "A Separate World" inscribed by Mr. He Xuezhu. However, in a hurry, we climbed the mountain on chairs, and seemed to have lost some sensitivity to the appreciation of every plant and tree. We only saw the winding and undulating mountain road, with mountains stacked on both sides. In the danger and steepness, there was still tranquility and beauty!</p>
<p>We roamed the mountain for about a day, from the rooster's head to the south slope to the north slope. Our eyes only swept over a corner of the entire mountain! Here, there are streams with gurgling sounds, lotus ponds covered with duckweed, desolate and solemn Living Buddha Temples, and shallow red tides similar to damp cloth. Although some of them are artificial embellishments, they cannot erase its natural tranquility!</p>
<p>Railway Hotel Stands Majestically on the Top of the Mountain</p>
<p>There are three parks arranged in the mountain villa. One is Zhongzheng Park, which contains the President's temporary residence and air-raid shelter, which was built in the 26th year of the Republic (1937). Now the trees and flowers are still green and vibrant! The other two are Wuqiao Park and Shulin Park, which are also being actively cultivated and watered.</p>
<p>The houses here are all Western-style houses built of rocks, tall and magnificent, just like urban buildings. In particular, the railway hotel where we stayed stands majestically on the top of the mountain, with a vast view. Looking around from here, one can see the rising sun in the east, or overlook the setting sun and hear the sounds of returning [birds], or glimpse the looming mountains, all full of poetry, making people reluctant to leave! Liu Sui, the author of Jigong Mountain Bamboo Branch Words, wrote such a poem: "A wisp of green smoke is like opening a cooking pot, gradually entering the woods and reaching the upper level. I am already tired of floating in the sea of people, and the building windows are open to watch the clouds rise!" Perhaps Liu's poem was not made up out of thin air!</p>
<p>No, an old man who has worked for the Pinghan Railway Bureau for 20 years said: "The spring scenery here is even more lovely. Azaleas and peach blossoms compete with each other in red, and orchids and unknown herbs fight for fragrance. It is a red mountain, and also a fragrant mountain!" These beautiful spring colors are certainly unattainable to the reporter at this time, but the cool atmosphere, set off by the quiet mountain scenery, is indeed worthy of being a summer resort.</p>
<p>The Grave of the Rebel Han Stains the Mountain's Scenery</p>
<p>Although the sparrow is small, it has all its internal organs. There are also noteworthy features among the mountain's cultural relics: On the hillside of Nangang, there is the tomb of Han Fuqu. It is generally believed that this matter has damaged the glory of the famous mountain, and people have expressed resentful sarcasm. Former students of Northeast Middle School even pulled out his original gravestone, intending to replace it with an epitaph that said "Traitor Han Mou." Later, it was opposed by Han Mou's colleagues, and no gravestone has been erected. Now, weeds grow wildly beside the desolate tomb, and the fate of a traitor is also tragic enough.</p>
<p>Registering Households and Obeying Foreigners</p>
<p>The total area of this mountain is only 100 square li, and the area of the church district accounts for a quarter. The total population is only 1,238, while foreign missionaries account for 147. There are only 293 buildings in total, while church buildings account for 123. In the past, they did not pay taxes or register their households, and seemed to live in "extraterritoriality"! Recently, the Jigong Mountain Administration sent personnel to register and check households, and they slightly complied. It is not known whether this phenomenon is due to our own [omission] or our laissez-faire! The Chinese people living on the mountain seem to be very [omission]!</p>
<p>The Boundary Issue Has Not Yet Been Resolved</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of Jigong Mountain has always been twisted. The people of Henan want to manage it, and the people of Hubei also want to manage it. Although it was assigned to the provincial government by the central government last year, the dispute over the northern and southern boundaries has still not been resolved. The current Jigong Mountain Administration of the Hubei Provincial Government is said to be adhering to the ten major and five major policies, encouraging people to raise bees, chickens, plant trees, and grow vegetables, and run one elementary school and one middle school. The general style is practical, but due to the lack of funds, neither provincial government has truly supported it, so it is at a loss and its achievements cannot be demonstrated!</p>
<p>Transportation Leads the Way</p>

<h3>Two-Year Review of United Nations Work (Part 2)</h3>
<p>July 8th, Shanghai Associated Translation</p>
<p>The Investigation Committee was composed of representatives from each member state of the Security Council and commenced meetings in the disputed area on January 30, 1947. It concluded its meetings on April 2nd, submitting a report to the Security Council.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in Greece, the Security Council held six meetings in March and April to discuss the proposed U.S. aid plan for Greece and Turkey. Pending new decisions by the Security Council, it resolved that an auxiliary team from the Balkan Investigation Committee should be stationed in the disputed area. Another suggestion was made to establish a special committee to ensure, through appropriate supervision, that foreign aid received by Greece was solely used to improve the welfare of the Greek people, but this suggestion was rejected by the Security Council.</p>
<p>On January 21, 1946, Ukraine urged the Security Council to pay attention to the military actions taken by British and Japanese troops against local residents in Indonesia. Ukraine felt this situation threatened the maintenance of international peace and security. On February 13th, a suggestion to send a committee to Indonesia and to issue a statement regarding the presence of British troops there was not adopted, and this issue was concluded. In March 1947, the Secretary-General received notification that the Dutch government and the Indonesian government had signed an agreement in Batavia on March 25th.</p>
<p>On February 4, 1946, Syria and Lebanon brought to the Security Council's attention the presence of French and British troops in Syria and Lebanon, and complained that the conditions for the withdrawal of French and British troops did not conform to the spirit and letter of the United Nations Charter. Subsequently, a suggestion was made, declaring that both parties would engage in negotiations without delay, and it was believed that French and British troops would withdraw as soon as possible depending on the progress of the negotiations. This suggestion was not adopted, but France and Britain indicated that they would implement this suggestion regardless, and it was finally approved by a majority in the Security Council, though the Soviet Union, one of the permanent members, did not agree. In May 1946, Lebanon reported to the Security Council that it was satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations, and Syria also reported that foreign troops had withdrawn from its territory.</p>
<p>On October 26, 1946, two British warships were damaged by mines in the Corfu Channel, resulting in the deaths of forty-four sailors. Such an incident might have led to war in the past. After an exchange of notes between Britain and Albania, the dispute was submitted to the Security Council in January.</p>
<p>Britain requested the Security Council to:</p>
<p>Ascertain the fact that the Albanian authorities were aware of the mines in the Corfu Channel, and proposed that Britain and Albania should resolve the dispute based on the ascertained facts, and if they failed, it should be submitted to the Security Council for discussion. This proposal received seven votes in favor, but the Soviet Union did not agree, and because the Soviet Union was a permanent member of the Security Council, this proposal was not passed. Later, Britain re-proposed that the dispute be immediately submitted to the International Court of Justice for resolution. The Security Council then passed this proposal on April 9th. On May 23rd, the Secretary-General of the United Nations received a report informing him that Britain had filed a lawsuit against Albania in the International Court of Justice.</p>
<p>According to the peace treaty to be concluded with Italy, Trieste should be designated as a free zone, and the United Nations should ensure the complete freedom and independence of the zone. Currently, the Security Council must protect the basic human rights of the residents of the zone, and must maintain public order and security. The Security Council passed the above plan on January 10, 1947, and accepted the responsibilities it should bear. One of the responsibilities is to appoint the administrator of the zone after consultation with Italy and Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>In the second year after the signing of the Charter in San Francisco, that is, this spring, the United Nations encountered the most intense dispute of the present day: the Palestine problem. A special session of the General Assembly was convened, and a special committee was established to investigate the Palestine problem and to make recommendations on what kind of government should be established there in the future.</p>
<p>This meeting was held at the request of Britain, which was administering Palestine under mandate, on April 28th at Flushing Meadow. After three weeks of intense discussions, the General Assembly heard presentations from both Arab and Jewish representatives, and finally decided to establish an investigation committee composed of representatives from eleven countries: Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, India, Iran, the Netherlands, Peru, Sweden, Uruguay, and Yugoslavia. The "Five Great Powers" did not participate.</p>
<p>Three weeks after the General Assembly made this decision, the investigation committee met in New York, completed its organizational plan, and then set off for Jerusalem. The powers of the investigation committee were very broad, including the power to listen to the opinions of anyone at will and to go to any location for investigation.</p>
<p>The investigation committee must complete its investigation report before September 1st, so that the member states of the United Nations can have the opportunity to study the recommendations made by the committee before the General Assembly convenes its next regular session.</p>
<p>The General Assembly unanimously continued to request the people concerned, especially the people of Palestine, to avoid any actions that would hinder the early resolution of this issue.</p>
<p>In April 1946, Poland requested the Security Council to consider the situation in Spain caused by the existence and activities of the Franco regime, and to take measures prescribed by the Charter. The Security Council then sent a subcommittee to study the situation, and on June 28, 1946, resolved to promote the facts that the Potsdam Conference, the San Francisco Conference, the United Nations General Assembly, and the Security Council had condemned the Franco regime. These facts had been confirmed by the subcommittee's investigation, so it decided to continue to pay attention to this situation, so as to be prepared to take necessary steps to maintain international peace and security at any time.</p>
<p>On November 4, 1946, the Security Council removed the Spanish situation issue from its agenda and transferred all relevant records and documents to the General Assembly for disposal. The General Assembly then passed a resolution on December 21st, declaring that the Franco regime could not represent the Spanish people, and recommending that the Spanish government should not be a member state of international organizations established by or related to the United Nations. Similarly, meetings or activities of the United Nations and the above-mentioned international organizations should not be allowed to be attended by Franco's Spain. The General Assembly also recommended that if a government representing the will of the people had not been established in Spain within a reasonable period, the Security Council should consider appropriate measures. In addition, all member states of the United Nations should recall their ambassadors or ministers from Spain.</p>
<p>Disarmament and Atomic Control</p>
<p>If large and small countries can agree on disarmament, then the world will know that the world has finally embarked on the road to lasting security. What achievements has the United Nations made on this key issue of peace? On December 14, 1946, the General Assembly convened a meeting in New York and passed a resolution. This resolution was originally proposed by the Soviet Union, requesting the Security Council to immediately consider effective measures: (1) to adjust and reduce military forces and armaments, (2) to ensure that all countries implement these measures in their entirety. The plan to be formulated should be submitted to the member states of the United Nations and presented for discussion at a special session of the General Assembly. On the same day, the General Assembly requested the Security Council to decide, to the extent possible, on information regarding the military forces of the United Nations. This military force should be supplied by the member states, so as to implement the first resolution.</p>
<p>The Security Council therefore established the Arms Regulation Committee on February 13, 1947, composed of representatives from each member state of the Security Council. It was ordered to prepare and submit recommendations to the General Assembly within three months in order to implement the General Assembly's resolution. The committee convened a meeting on March 24th and is still in progress. Among its tasks:</p>
<p>The General Assembly faces a problem, the survival of human culture, all depends on the solution of this problem, so the General Assembly promptly set up the Atomic Energy Commission when it convened a meeting in London. According to the French representative, this is a choice between chaos and peace. The General Assembly ultimately unanimously chose the path of peace. The Atomic Energy Commission was ordered to explore all aspects of the atomic energy control issue as soon as possible, and to put forward special recommendations to expand the exchange of information on basic science between countries for peaceful purposes, to control atomic energy to the extent necessary to ensure the peaceful application of atomic energy, to eliminate atomic weapons and all other heavy weapons capable of collective destruction from the armaments of various countries, and to provide effective guarantees through supervision and other means to protect countries that abide by the agreement from the danger of being destroyed or evading the agreement by other countries. The committee was composed of one representative from each member state of the Security Council and Canada (at that time, Canada was not yet a member of the Security Council). The first meeting was convened in New York on June 14, 1946. On December 14th of the same year, the General Assembly passed a disarmament resolution, urging the committee to quickly fulfill its mission requirements, and also requested the Security Council to quickly review the committee's report and the draft treaty for establishing an international control and supervision system.</p>
<p>On December 31st, the Atomic Energy Commission submitted its first report to the Security Council, containing research results and recommendations. On March 10, 1947, after discussing this report, the Security Council instructed the committee to continue to explore all aspects of the international control of atomic energy and to prepare a draft treaty or agreement within a reasonable period, and include it in its final recommendations for submission to the Security Council, and to submit a second report before the next session of the General Assembly on September 16th. The Atomic Energy Commission studied the Security Council's resolution and decided to refer the relevant issues to its subordinate executive subcommittee and second subcommittee for discussion. In order to enable the Security Council to maintain——</p>
<p>International Peace and Security</p>
<p>Article 43 of the Charter stipulates that member states of the United Nations should provide military force, assistance, and facilitation to the Security Council for dispatch. Therefore, on February 16, 1946, the Security Council instructed the Military Staff Committee to study the provisions of Article 43 of the Charter from a military perspective as the committee's first task, and to submit the results of the study and any recommendations to the Security Council. A year later, in accordance with the recommendations of the General Assembly, the Security Council urged the Military Staff Committee to submit the previously requested recommendations as soon as possible, and to submit recommendations on the basic principles of the composition of the United Nations army no later than April 30, 1947. The Military Staff Committee submitted a report on these basic principles as scheduled, and the Security Council reviewed it on June 4th.</p>
<p>Reconstruction and Post-War Issues</p>
<p>As a result of the war, many parts of the world are still in ruins. The war-stricken countries are doing their best to rebuild their destroyed houses, farms, factories, and transportation. From its initial sessions, the United Nations General Assembly realized that without international action, reconstruction would be neither adequate nor rapid. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Publishing Industry</p>
<h3>The Melancholy of Critics</h3>
<p>— Hu Shanyuan</p>
<p>Last autumn, I wrote "Ode to Melancholy" in the "Chunqiu" section of this newspaper, and came up with five melancholies, namely: "the melancholy of readers", "the melancholy of authors", "the melancholy of editors", "the melancholy of publishers", and "the melancholy of the current situation". Now that I think about it, I was actually missing "the melancholy of critics", whose position is similar to "the melancholy of authors", and should be located between "readers" and "editors".</p>
<p>What is the melancholy of critics? The melancholy of critics is great, at least not less than that of authors or editors.</p>
<p>When we see a good book, we cannot help but think: why doesn't the critic introduce it? When we see a bad book, we also want to think: why doesn't the critic point it out? What is someone's style like, what is their thought like, we hope the critic tells us; what kind of thought is popular, whether a certain technique is correct or not, we also hope the critic tells us. We hope that critics fulfill their responsibilities, improve the level of writing, and promote academic progress and cultural development. Our hope for them is great, and it is urgent.</p>
<p>But what about the critics now? Most of them are "silent as a mute", not saying a word. Occasionally, criticisms that appear in newspapers and magazines, although not entirely uniform, mostly cannot avoid only praise and no criticism. Especially bad is that if the writer is someone of unknown name, the critics always simply ignore it, not even a glance. Conversely, if it is the work of a famous scholar, then they all flock to praise it. Not only is the work of critics unsatisfactory, but their motives and personalities have also become a problem. The critics have not fulfilled their responsibilities, and we should condemn them!</p>
<p>But should the critics receive this condemnation? Although I am not a critic, I can depict the melancholy they suffer from injustice.</p>
<p>First of all, at present, critics have nowhere to publish their criticisms. General culture is declining, and the publishing industry has reached the point of lingering on its last breath. If what is published is not for political propaganda, it is for economic profit. Who has the space to publish your criticism? At the same time, precisely because of the poverty and fragility of the publishing industry, it seems that there is nothing that is worth reviewing, or can withstand a single comment. What's the use of a hero when there is nowhere to use his skills? Why blame the hero? Critics cannot but have their melancholy, and should not but have their forgiveness.</p>
<p>Secondly, critics cannot publish their correct criticisms. This kind of criticism, especially about pointing out problems, cannot be published. If the editor or author asks you to write a criticism, you can only praise, no longer point out problems. Sometimes they even want you to make excessive praise, far exceeding the facts. If you want to point out problems, the editor is always afraid of taking on the responsibility of scolding people. They always want to discuss it with you tactfully, suggesting that modification is best. If modification continues, they will make you completely unrecognizable, losing the original meaning.</p>
<p>Finally, critics also do not dare to publish their correct criticisms. This is also about pointing out problems. If you lightly point out the problems of a writer with a bad nature, it will quickly cause chaos, disturbing your family's peace. They will defend themselves, argue forcefully, and chatter endlessly, making you feel a headache. But this is still considered good. Even worse, they attack you, attacking not only your work, but also your personal life. When attacking you, they carefully choose their words, not choosing facts, not choosing any means. It seems that they must eat your flesh and sleep on your skin! As for their own work, they have long put it aside and do not care about it. What critic can bear the consequences of this kind of criticism? But these consequences often come with your criticism. When you think of this, do you still have the leisure to write and ink, implement correct criticism, and put yourself in the quagmire?</p>
<p>Critics, if they are qualified critics, are willing to do their best to promote scholarship and culture, just as every intellectual expects them to do. But is it possible for them? Especially now? Since it is impossible for them, they already feel melancholy. If they still have to feel condemned for the impossibility of fulfilling their responsibilities, then isn't their melancholy even greater?</p>
<p>The melancholy of others can still be attributed to the environment. As long as the environment improves, their melancholy will be relieved. Only the melancholy of critics cannot be completely relieved by improving the environment. Because the first item of their melancholy is about the environment, as long as culture develops and publishing flourishes, it can be smoothly relieved. But the second and third items, especially the third item, will occur in any environment, and there is simply no way to prevent it from happening. Therefore, in my opinion, a critic is destined to be a melancholic person, and their melancholy is even greater than that of authors and editors.</p>
<p>"Hard work but no reward" is an accurate portrayal of this kind of critic who distinguishes right from wrong.</p>
<p>There are also some creators who will learn Chekhov's argument and say: "Critics are parasites of creators". If so, then they, the critics, will truly be in a position of eternal suffering, more than just melancholy!</p>
<h3>Sociology of Education</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yongzeng</p>
<p>Author: Chen Kemei</p>
<p>Publication Date: May, Year 34</p>
<p>Publisher: World Book Company</p>
<p>This is a book providing a general discussion of the sociology of education, synthesizing various schools of thought and research materials on the subject. While the interpretations may not be profoundly original, they grasp the essentials, allowing readers to gain a clear understanding from the book. Additionally, it selectively introduces the historical background and research methods of the sociology of education, enabling us to grasp the core of the subject's inquiry.</p>
<p>The book is divided into ten lectures. Lecture 1: Explains the importance of the development of the sociology of education, the close relationship between education and society, and the reasons for the recent progress in sociology.</p>
<p>Lecture 2: Introduces two major schools of thought in the sociology of education: the educational school, whose founder is Dr. Su Zheluo, and the sociological school, represented by Professors Ellwood and Finney.</p>
<p>Lecture 3: Outlines the content and scope of the sociology of education.</p>
<p>Lectures 4 and 5: Describe the relationship between education and society. The relationships between education and social organization, social sanctions, social inheritance, and social progress are also discussed in great detail.</p>
<p>Lecture 6: Discusses the importance of social principles and presents the interconnectedness and application of three major principles: education and democracy, social efficiency, and cultural concepts. The author emphasizes that realizing democratic, efficient, and cultural social life requires adherence to these three social principles.</p>
<p>Lecture 7: Discusses educational surveys. This scientific method is the starting point and basis for educational implementation, as well as the endpoint and verification of implementation. Its contribution is to guide educators to generate emotions about improving schools, making educational administration academic and practical.</p>
<p>Lecture 8: Divides school administration into two aspects: external, including the public and the school, and internal, detailing the responsibilities, training, qualifications, and characteristics of administrative personnel.</p>
<p>The last two lectures describe the key points of curriculum research, the goals of education, and teaching methods, and point out the mistakes made by people in general in teaching in the past.</p>
<p>After reading this book, I have some feelings. The relationship between education and society is so close that society will not progress if socialized education does not flourish. The current chaos in Chinese society, the backwardness of education, the high percentage of illiteracy in the total population, and the distance of national basic education from the ideal make it ridiculous to talk about the socialization of education?</p>
<p>I believe that to save China's education from its plight, it is necessary to reform the current traditional formal education in schools, remove the barriers between schools and society, implement democratic education, and universalize education throughout society, so that educational opportunities are completely equal. On the one hand, adapt to social needs, and on the other hand, adapt to individual differences. In this way, education can become the driving force for transforming society, and an equal, free, progressive, and rational society can promote the continued development of education.</p>
<h3>Geography of Hainan Island</h3>
<p>— Lu Yuan</p>
<p>Written by Chen Zhengxiang, published by Zhengzhong Book Company</p>
<p>Hainan Island is the second largest island in our country, slightly smaller than Taiwan. It faces Taiwan across the sea. If Taiwan is the barrier of our country in the Eastern Pacific, then Hainan Island is the outpost of the South Pacific. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the attention of the Chinese people has shifted to Taiwan, which was developed by Japan, and many specialized works have been written, but the importance of Hainan Island has been neglected, and there are very few specialized works. Although the government recently set up a provincial administrative office in Hainan Island to develop the area, few domestic people have gone to develop it, probably because the Chinese people are not familiar with the island's geography. Chen's book "Geography of Hainan Island" can be said to be an analysis of Hainan Island in front of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Hainan Island has no less advantageous geographical environment than Taiwan, but Taiwan has become a place with developed industry and prosperous economy after the efforts of the Japanese, while Hainan Island is still in its original state. The author specifically and alarmingly points out the reasons in the book, and discusses the geographical environment of the island in detail, and also makes a correct comparison between the island and Taiwan in numbers, indicating that the development hope of Hainan Island is very great, which is not fabricated by the author out of thin air.</p>
<p>The book is divided into fourteen chapters, with about 60,000 words. First, it gives a general description of the island's geography, and then divides the chapters by terrain, climate, residents, products, industry, trade, transportation, and cities, and analyzes and discusses them so that readers can understand it at a glance. In the final chapter, the author points out that the three islands of the South China Sea near Hainan Island are coveted by foreign countries, which can especially arouse the attention of the Chinese people.</p>

<p>Many friends who are new to geometry come to me and ask me what good reference books are available? I always introduce them to the Commercial Press to buy a copy of Straight Line Figures to take a look at. Many friends who have read this book, although they don't praise the book, can naturally develop a great interest in geometry. The reason why I am keen to introduce this book is also here.</p>
<p>Hayashi Tsuruichi is a Japanese mathematician who not only has a high status in Japan, but also has a considerable reputation throughout the world. This book is full of Japanese atmosphere.</p>
<p>Mr. Shi Xianyan is still very promising in the domestic mathematics community. The translation of the book Straight Line Figures is quite fluent and also retains some of the original style.</p>
<p>Straight line figures are the simplest part of geometry, but they are extremely important and also quite interesting. This book introduces the properties of straight line figures to the reader in great detail, laying a very solid foundation for the reader. With a good foundation, learning about circles, areas, etc. will naturally be easy and full of fun.</p>
<p>The content of the book is very ordinary, but the structure is very unique - which is what I call the - Japanese atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the book, example problems and almost all straight line theorems are included. There are also solution pointers, which can stimulate people's thinking and arouse people's research mind. After each theorem, there is an appendix on usage, which is especially beneficial to our students.</p>
<p>As for the practical application of this book in learning, there is also one point, that is, the application of the theorem "The line connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the base and equal to half the base" makes it easy to solve many difficult problems.</p>
<p>I dare to say boldly! "If you can read this book in detail, it will definitely make you have a great interest in geometry!" (The book is written by Hayashi Tsuruichi, published by the Commercial Press)</p>
<h3>From Schopenhauer to Nietzsche</h3>
<p>— Shangguan Meibo</p>
<p>Written by Chen Quan, published by Datong Book Company</p>
<p>This book was published by Datong Book Company in November of last year. Although the title of the book is "From Schopenhauer to Nietzsche," the content is entirely about Nietzsche. Schopenhauer is only discussed in passing when describing Nietzsche's early thought. It would probably be difficult to find a more suitable person than the author, Chen Quan, a scholar of German philosophy and literature in our country, to introduce this great German thinker.</p>
<p>Nietzsche's philosophy has been introduced by many people in our country, and many of Nietzsche's own works have also been translated into Chinese. Unfortunately, to this day, Nietzsche is still the most misunderstood thinker in our country. Many intellectuals regard him as the ancestor of fascism, believing that his philosophy is the blueprint for fascist theory, which is a very regrettable mistake. Although Nietzsche's philosophy and fascism have many similarities on the surface, they are completely different in essence. The term "superman" in Nietzsche's original intention was only a symbol of a creator with vigorous vitality, but in the hands of militaristic fascists, it was transformed into a destroyer who killed and set fires.</p>
<p>On the eve of this war, Mussolini and Hitler did use a passionate, Nietzschean "kiss" to sing the praises of war and aggression, and successively set off prairie fires in Africa and Europe, attempting to realize their dream of a superhuman empire, which ultimately caused the tragic destruction and chaos in Western European countries today. After the world has suffered from the disaster of war, and after painful reflection, they unanimously began to criticize Nietzsche, blaming the responsibility for this catastrophe on the philosophy of the superman, as if the philosophy of the superman was the inducement that led to this war. Could this irrelevant misunderstanding be what Nietzsche expected when he created the philosophy of the superman? If Nietzsche knew in the underworld, could he not feel heartbroken?</p>
<p>If we want to analyze the reasons for this misunderstanding now, we certainly want to know the truth about Nietzsche. Nietzsche's writing is full of symbolism and lyricism, and it is not easy to understand his true meaning. Although there are many books that have introduced Nietzsche in the past, it can be said that none of them can truly explain his true meaning by penetrating his symbolic and lyrical artistic atmosphere. Now, Chen Quan's book introducing Nietzsche has successfully completed this difficult task. I hope that people who misunderstand Nietzsche can read this book. People who have read this book do not necessarily completely agree with Nietzsche or believe in Nietzsche, but they can avoid misunderstanding Nietzsche, which I dare to assert.</p>
<p>This book is divided into two parts. The first part discusses the formation and development of Nietzsche's thought, detailing the process of Nietzsche's transformation from agreeing with Schopenhauer to opposing Schopenhauer. Among them, the discussion of the mystical inspiration that Wagner's music gave to Nietzsche is quite unique and insightful, and is well worth reading. The second part introduces the system of Nietzsche's philosophy, and systematically explains Nietzsche's thought in terms of politics, religion, morality, love, etc., so that readers can have a detailed and clear understanding of Nietzsche's thought. What is especially commendable is that this book is not purely introductory in nature, but a semi-creative work. The author frequently elaborates on the essence of Nietzsche's philosophy with his own insights. Although there are some places that seem to need further discussion and debate, such as the author's claim that Nietzsche's advocacy of the "will to power" in his later years returned to his early Greek tragic thought, my opinion is not entirely the same as the author's. However, in today's widespread misunderstanding of Nietzsche, it is always a fortunate thing that such a book has appeared, and I especially recommend this rare good book to everyone with a gratified mood. As for the lively narration and beautiful writing throughout the book, they are all trivial matters.</p>
<h3>News from the Publishing Industry The US Information Office Publishes "The Potsdam Agreement"</h3>

Not only is the typesetting eye-catching, but also the translation is fluent and accurate, which is a rare work. The full text is more than 10,000 words, in both Chinese and English. In addition to distributing it to newspapers and libraries in various places, all groups and institutions that have read it can write to the office</p>
<h3>Nietzsche's Biography</h3>
<p>— Shi Pei</p>
<p>(Written by an anonymous author, published by Reader's Friend Society, first edition in Year 35)</p>
<p>In Sun Fuyuan's "Lu Xun and Nietzsche's Doctrine," he mentioned that Mr. Lu Xun said of Nietzsche's "Thus Spoke Zarathustra": "The writing is vigorous, and it sounds like gold and stone when reading it. And the essence of his doctrine lies in encouraging human life, thought, and culture to gradually move upward, not to stop in trivial, despicable, and only material lives." These words are not only a very thorough and insightful criticism of Nietzsche's doctrine, but even of Nietzsche's person. As early as 1869, when Nietzsche was teaching at the University of Basel, his colleague Jacob Burckhardt said: "It is better to call Nietzsche an artist than a scholar." This comment echoes Mr. Lu Xun's words.</p>
<p>The author of this book takes the same perspective to look at Nietzsche. He said, "Nietzsche's life is not the life and death of an ordinary person, it is a work of art, a tragedy! There is no difference between understanding Nietzsche's work and understanding his 'person,' and at the same time, Nietzsche can only be seen from an artistic point of view. ..." In the postscript of this book, Qiu wrote a rather interesting and meaningful metaphor: "It is said that 'Cinnabar' is a kind of poison, and feudal times silly and loyal to the emperor's ministers often licked it to commit suicide. I don't know what the toxicity of this plant is, but from what I see in the paintings, it is a big spot of blood red. I really like that kind of red. I love this kind of red very much. Therefore, I think toxic things also have their beauty. 'Cinnabar' can kill people, but 'red' gives us beautiful stimulation." Nietzsche's philosophy of the superman is like this "Cinnabar."</p>
<p>Today, we live in a turbulent and uneasy era in which totalitarian forces have re-emerged, and I feel that it is quite necessary to have a more correct and progressive understanding of Nietzsche. During World War II, Hitler's brutality and violence were rooted in Nietzsche's philosophy of the superman as the fascist ideology. In mid-month, I accidentally read in an English newspaper about the news that fascist forces are still lurking in various European countries and are active in Argentina. From these reports, we can know that although Hitler has been defeated miserably, the remaining troubles still exist and there is a tendency to regroup. In such days, we should have a new estimate of Nietzsche, who is touted as the "ancestor" of fascism. "Nietzsche's Biography" is a biography that gives us a understanding of and vigilance against Nietzsche. The author has a long-term study of Nietzsche's thought. The motivation that aroused him to write this biography came from talking about Nietzsche's "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" and Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid."</p>
<p>The book is divided into twelve chapters: 1. "Little Pastor" - Son of Christianity; 2. Facing Schopenhauer's Mirror; 3. Young Professor; 4. "The Birth of Tragedy"; 5. Friendship with Wagner; 6. Love and Women; 7. Creation, Creation; 8. Abandoning Schopenhauer; 9. An Atheist? 10. Superman, Superman; 11. He's Crazy; 12. The Completion of the Tragedy; Postscript. The descriptions in each chapter are very meaningful and fluent. With a rich literary and artistic brush, he portrays the deep layers of Nietzsche's life and thought. He maintains a purely objective and rational position with a calm artist's attitude. Praising good and criticizing evil, daring to speak and daring to say, this is the most basic and important spirit of biographical literature, and this book has already achieved this point.</p>
<p>Nietzsche's father was a devout Protestant pastor, and his mother was the daughter of a pastor, so he grew up in a family full of religious atmosphere. He was deeply influenced by his parents in his childhood. In addition to faithfully promoting the teachings, his father also loved poetry and music, and especially admired Emerson (R.W. Emerson). Emerson's works were often placed on his desk and at hand. Emerson's profound and sincere tone penetrated into the soul of Nietzsche's father. Nietzsche's mother was beautiful and healthy, full of vitality. It can be said that Nietzsche's praise of vitality was obtained from his mother. But Nietzsche was not even two years old when his father passed away. At this time, the family moved once, and the mother became depressed and taciturn. Later, Nietzsche became taciturn, perhaps all influenced by this. When he was a child, he hardly made a sound all day long. He did not participate in intense competitive games. He silently thought about something by himself. When he grew up a little, he went to school. He was a good student in school and his character was very good, but he was not used to playing with his classmates. He loved poetry and music, and shut himself in a lonely house all day long. This kind of personality development became his loneliness when he grew up. He was lonely all his life, pondered and meditated all his life, and finally went mad and died.</p>
<p>Nietzsche's entire thought can be said to be a collection of contradictions: from writing to Schopenhauer to opposing Schopenhauer; from denying life to affirming life; from Hellenism to Romanism; from loving women to scolding women; from being madly in love with life to blindly believing in life; and finally reaching the extreme "superman" philosophy. This is the peak of his thought, but the reason why he erected such an all-out and transcendent doctrine was entirely caused by his strong opposition to Schopenhauer's pessimistic view of the world. The difference between him and Schopenhauer is that he used "work" and "struggle" as the criterion of life; Schopenhauer advocated "world-weariness" and "selflessness"; they both admitted that life is painful, but one advocated selflessly ignoring the pain, and the other believed that one should face the pain and overcome it with struggle and work. The former is Schopenhauer, and the latter is Nietzsche.</p>
<p>As for how Hitler used Nietzsche? This is because Nietzsche praised war, believing that war is a good medicine for an aging nation. He compared the aging of a nation to a person suffering from lung disease. It needs a cruel and sharp leaf to cure it, and this medicine is war. Thus, war also became a part of the philosophy of the superman, and was indulged by Hitler, becoming the culprit for the massacre of mankind. However, if Nietzsche knew in death, perhaps he would also condemn Hitler's rampant behavior? Because Nietzsche once said such a thing: "Everyone should judge others by his own reasons." Therefore, Nietzsche is not necessarily a thorough warmonger, and his words are worth savoring.</p>
<p>In short, from the teachings of history, we have determined that the most basic conditions for human survival are the inevitable existence of emotion and mutual assistance. This is the truth of all ages that cannot be obtained without labor. Therefore, Nietzsche's search is abandoned by us. Now let us look at Nietzsche from another aspect. After 1875, when Nietzsche was thirty years old, his health deteriorated greatly. Weakness and mental and physical loneliness and pain began from then until he was close to madness and death (died at the age of fifty-six). But he still held the pen tightly and wrote out his profound thoughts. His strong and unyielding will enabled him to still think and create while lying in bed. His love of life and the eternally burning fire of his spirit made him immortal. From this scene, we see Nietzsche, and we will see infinite vitality, so that our own humble and shrinking souls are invigorated and our courage to live is enhanced! This is the main spirit of Lu Xun and Jacob Burckhardt's evaluation of Nietzsche. When I despise Nietzsche's doctrine, whether this spirit, the sharpness of its vigor, is worth learning and emulating, I think readers will understand.</p>
<p>Finally, let me quote Havelock Ellis's words as the end of this article: "If we look back at the end of the 19th century and the 30 years before and after, we can know that the trend of thought in that era was completely dominated by two people with completely opposite consciousness and ideals: Tolstoy and Nietzsche. Tolstoy represents the Christian socialist and humanitarian ideals, which are even more excessive than Christian doctrine. Nietzsche represents the rationalist, heretical, and individualist ideals, which are also excessive compared with ordinary rationalism. They are all artists who have completed themselves in their own ways, keen psychologists, forwarders who are struggling on the path of life, and workers who are selflessly and painstakingly seeking something."</p>
<p>These words can be said to be pertinent, and I hope that everyone will read Nietzsche's Biography with a calm eye.</p>

<h3>"The Anchor" is Back!</h3>
<p>— Shilang</p>
<p>In the Sino-Japanese Naval War of 1894, the Beiyang Navy, known as the Chinese pillar, suffered two defeats in the Yellow Sea and Weihaiwei, with the entire army annihilated.</p>
<p>Among them, my Far East's largest flagship, the "Zhenyuan," was captured by Japan. The two large iron anchors on the Zhenyuan ship have been displayed in Tokyo's Hibiya Park as war victory souvenirs of the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>The warships that were sunk or destroyed by artillery fire in the two naval battles are not included in the calculation.</p>
<p>The "Anchor," which was labeled with the mark of "humiliation" and displayed in Japan, has been there for a full forty-three years. Now that the "Anchor" can return to the motherland in "triumph," how can we, as Chinese descendants, not sincerely rejoice!</p>
<p>But in historical significance, the defeat of the Sino-Japanese War can be explained by the corruption and incompetence of the Qing Dynasty, which explained the reasons for its inevitable defeat.</p>
<p>The reason why the navy at that time was completely defeated was not without reason. The so-called Beiyang Fleet, not only the tonnage, but even the power and the power of the artillery were far inferior to Japan. The sailors and soldiers rarely trained on weekdays. How could they not be completely annihilated when they faced the enemy in battle?</p>
<p>It is said that Empress Dowager Cixi misappropriated a large sum of public funds to add to the Summer Palace to celebrate her own birthday, but turned a blind eye to the funding for navy training. With such an Empress Dowager Cixi, who had no opinion and no vision, presiding over the government, how could she not allow the Japanese to be unscrupulous, occupy Korea, cede the Liaodong Peninsula, seize Taiwan and Penghu, and continue to attack Dalian and capture Lushun! Leaving the most shameful bloodstain in Chinese history.</p>
<p>Now, this "Anchor," which has been weathered and battered, has returned to the motherland with the glory of victory. The lessons she gives us are all worth pondering.</p>

<h3>Profile of Palestine</h3>
<p>— Pu Lun</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Palestine has always been a land of contention and clamor, with Jews and Arabs unable to resolve their respective prejudices. Recently, a proposal was made to the Palestine Investigation Committee to have British troops withdraw from Palestine and form a democratic state jointly by Jews and Arabs. Now, let us briefly introduce this "Holy Land" of the world, so that everyone can have a concise outline.</p>
<p>When a modern traveler journeys to the ancient land of Palestine, the relics recorded in the Bible vividly unfold before his eyes, page by page. In every corner he visits, these relics have faded with time. He will be amazed to find that places like Hebron have lost their names in time, for that place was the city ruled by King David; similarly, he will also be amazed to find Bethlehem, the city where Jesus was born in a manger. Also, in the area of Jericho, the city walls are in utter disrepair. And in these places, people live in stone houses or brick rooms, defending their descendants, working with crude tools, passing down through generations, eating leavened and unleavened bread, and then dying.</p>
<p>Since the Hebrew prophets, Jesus Christ, and his twelve disciples first established the great religious precepts of the world, this holy land has changed very little, although time has passed so long. From Phoenicia (now Lebanon) to Egypt, and from the Mediterranean Sea to the Dead Sea and the Jordan River, the surrounding area totals 10,000 square miles, equivalent to the size of Maryland. In terms of topography, it can be divided into three parts: the coastal plain, which runs parallel to the sea, includes ancient Philistia and Sharon, and is the most abundant grain-producing area in the Middle East. The central part is a mountainous region, which includes historical centers such as Bethlehem, Hebron, and Jerusalem. Another part is the Dead Sea and the Jordan River. Although Palestine has a large sandy desert, it has become a prosperous place through skillful management.</p>
<p>Initially, the ancient Hebrews were a nomadic people. They lived in "wool houses," which meant relying on wool for protection. The Apostle Paul was the most famous preacher of the Bible. His hometown, Tarsus, still retains the custom of wearing woolen sweaters; because Paul learned to weave wool as a child. Several cities in the Holy Land remain intact to this day. In other places in the Bible, archaeologists have not yet discovered them, but they continue to excavate. Each of the discovered cities, covering an area of six to ten acres, has been built into a solid defense. Outside each city, there are several affiliated small towns. The people living in the lowlands, as recorded in the Old Testament, lived in mud-brick houses and led a laborious and arduous life. Those living in the highlands lived in stone houses and lived a relatively better life.</p>
<p>The stories of biblical Palestine are permeated with inherited customs and mixed with legends and events. From the time when Abraham, the ancestor of the Jewish nation, led his people away from Ur of the Chaldees near the Persian Gulf, until the time of Jesus, Palestine was a prosperous province of Rome; and now, two thousand years have passed. But Palestine has changed many rulers: Egyptians, Syrians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and Romans. By the seventeenth century, Arabs made up the largest number of people in Palestine. Every ruler who came to this place burned temples and brought their own religion and culture.</p>
<p>But the green mountains still remain in this historical land of the Bible.</p>
<h3>Implementing the High School Subject System</h3>
<p>— Yang Pingzhang</p>
<p>For the sake of countless middle school students' futures and their precious time, I cannot help but shout out this slogan—implement the high school subject system—to plead for them.</p>
<p>Judging from the economic capabilities of ordinary people today, most are preparing to work after graduating from middle school, and not many can enter university. However, most middle school graduates, after leaving school, cannot find suitable work; the reasons are of course many, but the main one is that the knowledge they have gained in school is incompatible with the reality of society. In other words, the school's curriculum cannot be rationally aligned with the needs of society.</p>
<p>I believe that in six years of elementary school education, ordinary knowledge has already been acquired to some extent, and with the addition of three years of junior high school education, more advanced general knowledge is obtained; therefore, in high school, one can indeed enter a specialized path, that is, subject specialization, allowing them to choose a subject to specialize in according to their interests. This will allow them to concentrate on the subjects they choose. In this way, not only is it unnecessary to force students to study subjects they do not like, but it can also shorten the learning process. For example, those who want to achieve something in literature in the future do not seem to need to study too much mathematics and physics; those preparing to study electrical engineering can also spend most of their time on mathematics and physics related to that subject. In the learning process, the goal is to understand everything thoroughly, without any confusion. If they study hard during these three years, the results will certainly be remarkable.</p>
<p>This is a rather serious educational problem, especially in our country, which is in need of young people. We must reform the unreasonable educational system to cultivate talents. I hope that those who care about education will pay special attention to this issue, express their opinions more often, and guide the old middle school system onto a new path!</p>
<h3>Ambition</h3>
<p>— Zhong Qi</p>
<p>Japanese newspaper: "We Japanese share the Pacific Ocean with the Americans. We take the bottom, and they take the surface."</p>
<h3>Political Changes in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>— Zhao Ji</p>
<p>During the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, Xinjiang was divided into two regions: the Southern Route of the Tianshan Mountains and the Northern Route of the Tianshan Mountains. The Northern Route of the Tianshan Mountains was further divided into four parts: the Khoshut, the Dzungar, the Derbet, and the Torghut. Among them, the Dzungar tribe was the strongest. In the twelfth year of the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing dynasty, Galdan, the Khan of the Dzungars, conquered the Khoshut tribe, unified the Oirat tribes, and occupied most of the Northern Route of the Tianshan Mountains. After Galdan's death, his nephew, Tsewang Arabtan, succeeded him and surrendered to the Qing court. However, the Dzungar tribe was fickle and repeatedly sent troops to invade other tribes, but they were always pacified by the Qing court. Although the Dzungar tribe declined later, the Khoit tribe, a subordinate of the Derbet, rose up and occupied the entire Northern Route of the Tianshan Mountains. Emperor Gaozong of the Qing dynasty ordered Zhao Hui to lead troops to attack and unify the Northern Route of the Tianshan Mountains. The Qing court then sent troops to garrison in Yili, Urumqi, and Tarbahatai, and the General of Yili governed the area.</p>
<p>The Southern Route of the Tianshan Mountains has always been occupied by the Hui people. In the early Qing dynasty, the Islam of the Southern Route was divided into two factions: the White Mountain Sect and the Black Mountain Sect. The two factions were irreconcilable and attacked each other. At this time, the Khan of the Dzungars was Galdan, who helped the White Mountain Sect and destroyed the Black Mountain Sect, and the Dzungars governed the area. However, when Tsewang was the leader of the Dzungar tribe, he rejected the White Mountain Sect and replaced it with the Black Mountain Sect. He also captured the two sons of the leader of the White Mountain Sect, the Elder Khoja and the Younger Khoja. Later, Amursana, the leader of the Khoit tribe, wanted to obtain the support of the four tribes, so he released the Elder Khoja and lent him troops to stabilize the Southern Route of the Tianshan Mountains. In the twenty-second year of the reign of Emperor Qianlong, the Qing army pacified the Khoit tribe, so the Elder and Younger Khojas became independent in Kashgar. The Qing court sent Zhao Hui and Fude to suppress them.</p>
<p>In the first year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi, the Hui people in the Southern Route rebelled. Khoja Buzurg, the son of Zhang Ge'er, a Hui chieftain, led the soldiers of Kokand from Mongolia to invade. Yaqub Beg Pasha, a general of Kokand, occupied the Northern and Southern Routes of the Tianshan Mountains. At this time, Pasha's power was very strong, and some Qing officials even suggested abandoning the Northern and Southern Routes of the Tianshan Mountains. Zuo Zongtang insisted that they should not be abandoned. In the first year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu, Zuo Zongtang led troops to attack, and the area was pacified in the fourth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu. In the eighth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu, the Northern and Southern Routes of the Tianshan Mountains were merged into one Xinjiang Province.</p>
<h3>Wen Tianxiang's Righteous Death</h3>
<p>— Ji Ming</p>
<p>The Grand Historian said: "The brave do not necessarily die for righteousness, and even ordinary people can be encouraged by admiration for righteousness." She Manshu also said: "It is easy to die generously, but it is difficult to die calmly for righteousness." Therefore, it is known that Wen Tianxiang's ultimate loyalty in Yanjing was even more difficult than that of loyal ministers and martyrs throughout history. Why? Because when Tianxiang was executed, the Southern Song Dynasty had been destroyed for a long time. The Yuan Prime Minister Boyan persuaded him, saying: "Now the world has returned to our dynasty, the country is at peace, and people have forgotten the Song Dynasty. Even if you die calmly for righteousness, future generations may not know." The young emperor also persuaded him, saying: "Your loyalty to the Song Dynasty is known to the world, but the fate of the country cannot be reversed. Why not submit and face north, and jointly seek wealth and honor?" For Tianxiang, at this time, a moment of hesitation could have led him to become a continuation of a second minister. However, he was finally able to suppress himself and achieve a positive result, relying on the "righteous spirit" in his heart.</p>
<p>The History of Yuan records that on the day Tianxiang was executed, Yanjing was covered in wind and sand, and nothing could be seen within a few feet. Later, his posthumous writings were found in his belt, which read: "Confucius said, 'Achieve benevolence'; Mencius said, 'Take righteousness.' Only with righteousness can benevolence be achieved. Reading the books of sages and worthies, what have I learned? From now on, I can be almost without shame." These thirty-two characters still have vitality today. Wang Pan, a scholar at the time (who served the Yuan Dynasty after the fall of the Song Dynasty), wrote a poem mourning him, saying: "The Great Yuan did not kill Minister Wen, both loyalty and righteousness were obtained. His righteousness was like when King Han sealed his teeth, and his loyalty was like when the Shu general beheaded Yan Shi. ×××××××, ×××××××, I am afraid that the historians will not write it down, so the old man writes a new poem with tears." Wang was originally a second minister, and he could not help but feel moved when he saw Tianxiang's death. This shows that justice is in the hearts of the people, regardless of whether it is recorded in history.</p>
<h3>Four Knows</h3>
<p>— Chen Dexin</p>
<p>Yang Zhen of the Han Dynasty served as the Inspector of Jingzhou and recommended Wang Mi to be the Magistrate of a county. At night, Mi visited Zhen and presented him with ten catties of gold as a thank you gift. Zhen was furious and said, "An old friend knows you, but why don't you know your old friend?" Mi said, "No one knows at night." Zhen said, "Heaven knows, the gods know, I know, and you know. What do you mean by 'no one knows'?" Mi left in shame.</p>
<p>If the officials of today's officialdom could all have Zhen's noble character and integrity, then the stability of the country and the prosperity of society would be readily achievable.</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Shu</p>
<p>The Broadcasting Industry in America</p>
<p>In America, broadcasting has become a large educational and commercial enterprise. The broadcasting industry comes with radio. Many American broadcasting companies broadcast twenty-four hours a day. On average, each town has three to four broadcasting companies broadcasting, so a five-tube radio can receive at least a hundred stations, which depends entirely on the frequency. When I lived in Texas, I could receive stations from Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, but not programs from New York and Washington. Chinese and London programs rebroadcasted from San Francisco can also be received. American broadcasting programs in the morning are mostly about religion and current affairs, in the afternoon about current affairs and records, and in the evening are special programs. There are singing programs sponsored by tobacco companies, and Hollywood stars' comedies, among which the crosstalk of female star Ann Southern and male star Bob Hope is especially wonderful. Almost every sentence is funny, and sometimes it can really make you laugh until your stomach hurts. The scripts are all written in advance by experts and read on the spot. Some novels are also adapted for broadcast on the radio. Many Hollywood film scripts are transformed from radio scripts. Sports news also has a large audience, because American games are mostly held at night, and temporary broadcasting stations are set up in the stadiums. Many American universities also have broadcasting courses. From this point, we can see why the American broadcasting industry is so developed and does not fall into the lower class. Broadcasters are mostly specially trained experts. For example, current affairs commentaries are always given by experts on international issues. Many newspaper editorial writers are recruited by broadcasting companies to work as broadcasters. University broadcasting courses, in addition to experts in pronunciation and teaching techniques, also have a complete set of broadcasting equipment. Each student must practice on the spot, and the professors and classmates become his audience. Movie stars regard broadcasting as a way to make money, because the remuneration for filming is calculated per film or per week, while broadcasting companies calculate per show, and the time spent is very short, only about fifteen minutes. They are not as intimate and interesting on the screen as they are on the radio. Broadcasting has the power to attract listeners to become moviegoers, so movie stars often use broadcasting to promote themselves. Everyone admits that Bob Hope can't act at all, he just fools around, but he has a large audience, which is actually his radio audience. Chinese universities should quickly set up broadcasting courses to cultivate high-quality broadcasting talents, so that there will be no terms such as "chu na" on the radio. (Twenty-one)</p>
<p>Scientific Essay</p>
<h3>Epiphyllum (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jia Zuzhang</p>
<p>Our interest in the Epiphyllum is because we all know the idiom "昙花一现" (tán huā yī xiàn), which means "epiphyllum blooms once," referring to something that is rare and fleeting. Epiphyllum is a simplified name, its full name is called 優曇缽華 (yōu tán bō huá) or 優曇華 (yōu tán huá), found in the Lotus Sutra: "The Buddha told Sariputra, such wonderful Dharma, is like the 優曇缽華 (udumbara flower), appearing once in a while." This so-called "once" not only refers to the extremely short time it blooms, but also refers to its rarity to bloom, "appearing once in a while" means "blooming occasionally." Therefore, the History of the Southern Dynasties says: "The udumbara flower is a Buddha's auspicious sign, appearing once every three thousand years, and when it appears, the Golden Wheel King is born."</p>
<p>The Lotus Sutra does not specify the form of the Epiphyllum. It is not easy to investigate what kind of plant it is. According to what is said in the General Records: "The udumbara grows in Zhaoqing Prefecture, with no flowers but fruit," then it belongs to the fig genus. The Dictionary of Chinese Terms follows this statement: "Udumbara is the name of a flower in Sanskrit, also known as 優曇缽華 (udumbara flower), and belongs to the fig genus. It is produced in the foothills of the Himalayas and the Deccan Plateau, Sri Lanka, etc. The trunk is more than ten feet high, and the leaves are of two kinds, one smooth and one rough, both four or five inches long, with pointed ends. The flowers are dioecious, very small, and hidden in the 　-shaped concave receptacle. The receptacle is as large as a fist or a thumb, with more than ten leaves, edible but of poor taste." If this statement is true, then the Epiphyllum also blooms every year, just because it is a 　 head inflorescence, the ancient Indians could not observe it. According to the Biography of the Persian Kingdom in the Book of Liang, "In December, there is the 優鉢曇花 (upala flower), which is fresh and lovely." That is a plant with beautiful flowers, which is completely different from what is said in Yitongyun. The Yunnan Records follows this statement, saying: "The 優曇花 (udumbara flower) is located on a stone in Cao Creek Temple, ten miles northwest of Anning Prefecture, shaped like a lotus, with twelve petals. There is one more in a leap month. It is white and fragrant. It was planted from the Western Regions and is also a species of the Sala flower. Later, it was cut down due to war, and there was no longer that species. Now, a branch suddenly sprouts from the root, and it is already as big as an embrace." The same book also has records of the He Mountain Flower and the Sala Flower, which seem to refer to the same plant:</p>
<p>"The He Mountain Flower tree is six or seven feet high, its texture is similar to osmanthus, its flowers are white, each with twelve petals, corresponding to the twelve months, and there is always one more petal in a leap year. It is popularly believed to be a species left by immortals, at the foot of He Mountain in Shangguan, Dali Prefecture, and the locals named the place after it."</p>
<p>"The Sala flower is in the Local God Temple in the provincial capital. Its stem is similar to the He Mountain Flower in Dali Prefecture. The Buddha blooms vigorously, its color is white, slightly yellow. The strange fragrance is fragrant, not the smelly taste of ordinary flowers. A stamen protrudes from the center, like a millet spike, hanging out of the petal, each with twelve braids, always one more petal in a leap year. It is said that a high monk put two rosary beads into the soil, and one bead came out of this tree." From the textual research of these three texts, it is a magnolia family plant. The Japanese once regarded the American-native American magnolia as the auspicious flower, which is a mistake. Because it should be a plant native to China or India.</p>
<p>There is also a saying that the 　 flower is also called 優　羅花 (upala flower), probably a different transliteration. Cen Shen has a song of the 優缽羅花 (upala flower), which explains its origin and form, but refers to another kind of herbaceous cabinet: "Shen once talked about Buddhist scriptures and heard of the 優缽羅花 (upala flower), which he had not seen with his own eyes. In the year of Gengshen in the Tianbao era, Shen was honored to be the prefectural judge of Dali and took charge of the censor's Yushi, leading the deputy envoy of the Northwest Court's branch. Since I had plenty of time in office, I planted trees and medicinal herbs in the mansion court, made mountains and ponds, and wandered among them, enough to send pride to Jiaohe. A small official offered this flower, saying that he got it from the south of the Tianshan Mountains, its shape is different from all grasses, its momentum is like a crown, and it rises sharply, not extending to the sides, the flowers are folded in the middle, and the leaves are wrapped outside, the strange fragrance rises in the wind, and the beautiful color matches the scenery. The green stems and green leaves are beautiful in color, □ leaves six petals, flowers nine rooms, night closed, early opening, more strange fragrance." The Chengyuan Sketches compiled by Wu Changyuan of the Qing Dynasty also mentions 優　羅 (upala), saying: It blooms on April 8th, and bears fruit in winter, like a ghost building a peng, shedding its clothes, very similar to a golden Buddha statue. The etiquette system of the Li Yi Zhi Si used to have this flower, but now it is gone." This is based on the assumptions of "Golden Wheel King is born" and "Buddha blooms vigorously," which are extremely unreliable.</p>
<p>Combining the above old records, there are three types of plants that can be called Epiphyllum: one is a type of fig, one is a type of magnolia, and one is a herbaceous flower of an unknown type. But none of these three types of plants are the cactus plants we see today. To recognize the cactus plants we see today as Epiphyllum, there are no old records to verify, it must be a very recent matter.</p>
<p>To determine what the original Epiphyllum plant was, the most appropriate way is to directly visit India to seek it. I wonder if Sanskrit scholars have seen any more detailed records about the Epiphyllum?</p>
