<h3>東北共軍分兩派　雙方摩控表面化</h3>

<h3>花園口堵復工程完成經過</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕黄河花園口緒復工程，於抗戰結束後，由前水利委員會集我國經騐豐富之工程專家，及聯總來華之工程師專家等，自卅四年秋冬間開始進行，歷時近二年，此艱巨工程始吿完成，所用材料數量龐大，據初步估計，共耗柳枝一萬萬二千萬市斤，黍稭六千萬市斤，繩纜二百六十萬市斤，土八十萬公方，石料十五萬公方。上述材料堆壘所佔空間至爲可觀，就柳枝及黍稭兩項材料而言，用以舖築三尺高六尺寬之道路，可自南京築至上海，所需繩纜，足以造成核桃之大粗繩，將南京全城圍撓一百卅道，加上石塊土方耗用之鉅，亦至驚人。</p>
<p>黄河在決口後，歷數年來未加堵塞，且任其數度改道，致黄水向淮河流域大流，而淮河下游經徐州出每一段，自淸或豐五年前已被黃河奪佔而淤塞淮河水流已無出路，皖蘇低地，每年必致成災，且低地湖沼面積逐年增大，湖底則年年增高，如再拖延不修，黄河不獨足以吞噬皖蘇肥沃之地，且有由運河流入長江之勢，華中東部水系勢將全部被其攪亂，况黄河在此一帶氾濫七八年之久，始終並未冲出水道，乃至今日完成之堵口工程，方導黄水復入故道。</p>
<p>施工計劃　堵口工程施工之經過，至爲艱鉅，其間屢次失敗，幾經危險，卒於全體工程人員之努力，始克完成。花園口爲全河奪入，口門又經八年淤澱，河底較前積高八尺，決口上游河底又刷深七尺。冬春水面，比故道河底已低九尺，堵塞決口時，必須將水面抬高一丈二尺，始能使全河　入故道。又花園口土質爲極細之沙，不能受急流沖刷，故堵塞計劃，不如一般堵塞決口簡單，經專家之硏究，設計後，始決定用拋石平塲之方法，使口門寬四百八十七丈之花園口西部三百卅七丈之淺灘，採用綑鑲進佔法，東部水深三尺至一丈五尺之部份（一百五十丈）則建立拋橋木橋一道，上鋪鋼軌，用大塊石料拋擲橋下，堆成石壩，阻斷河水，迫使回歸故道。因黄河土質爲細沙，在拋擲石塊前，先於橋下及橋位下游，舖成柳枝編成之墊褥，石塊拋於墊褥上，使不致大量沉入泥下，下游河底亦不至被滾流急水冲成深坑，攔河石壩拋至相當高度，則上游水位自然抬高。壩頂流水太急，則改用柳枝包石，綑成二三丈長大枕拋下，層層加高，直至水回故道爲止。唯石塊與柳枝堆成之攔河石壩，尙可透水，均須在下游用黍稭綑鑲一邊壩，然後在石壩與邊壩間塡土閉氣，再在石壩後面加立大塞，石堤即成大堤之永久護岸。</p>
<p>工程過程　該項計劃決定後，曾於重慶水工實駝處，作多次模型試騐，並在四川長壽縣，作過一次大規模之實地試騐，然後於卅四年秋冬，先作踏勘，及測量等初步工作，堵口工程人員，及基本工人後於卅五年一月始至花園口，至三月一日，乃正式開工，以後因中共之多方阻撓，商洽結果，遂決分段負責辦理，同年始全面開始工作，於是聯總亦派工程顧問塔德，率領十數位工作人員，携帶大量器材，參加工作；行總派工作隊赴工地，發放麵粉，衛生事務，河一省政府，乃組成招工購料委員會，代招民工，購運黎稽，柳枝，椿木；交通部彰浴段工程處，建築自平漢路廣武車站，通至花園口之鐵路，平漠鐵路　其大量列車，趕運器材與糧食，黄河水利委員會組織堵口復堤工程局，專負施工之責，在此通力合作之下，工程進行，甚爲迅速，其間一度因中共要求緩堵，略有停頓。深水部分，因河漕甚平，最深處亦僅一丈五尺，造橋工作，進行較爲順利，一百五十丈長之橋，六月廿一日即已完成，後因石塊運輸不濟，六月廿日水漲，若干橋樑多被冲走，致工程益增困難。且以六月至九月水勢日漲，流量平均在六千公尺以上工程無法進行，至十月五日始行復工。其中經過幾度失敗，迄十一月起，乃改用柳枝包石綑枕，十二月廿五日已將口門東部最深一段河漕塡平，同時橋上五條平行軌道，亦已舖竣，旋即開始平堵拋石，十二月廿七日上游水面抬高至三尺六寸，乃開始放水，卅六年一月十一日至十五日，水勢高漲，石壩上下游水面相差六尺，晝夜加緊搶救，已趕不及，若干石壩，多被冲坍，不得已乃於石壩一邊，用柳枝鑲寬三丈，以防水流冲刷，壩頂則用柳石分層塡高，使河床增高六尺，流水不能越過壩頂。又因故道引河太小，故除原有兩條引河外，另闢四條，使河水於合龍過程中，大部回復故道，形成分流，减低冲力。又爲使淄離開口門，直趨故道，在西壩頭以西，加築排永壩兩道。此等工程，均於三月廿七日完成。</p>
<p>缺口稱爲「金門」，同時上下口兩邊，均有强烈廻流，名爲「金門占」，必須特別堅固，乃用柳枕與大鐵絲籠造成，自兩金門占相對，推下柳枕，就是合龍。此段工程於三月十五日完成。</p>
<p>因正壩下游石塊太多，壩底和金門多次滲漏，故須做閉氣工作，閉氣工程，在正壩上游，離正壩遠約六丈，另鑲一道，平行邊壩，邊壩與正壩間塡土，使漏水隙縫，爲土塡漏，此項工程，於四月廿日完成，至此黄河花園口堵口復堤之艱巨工程，乃吿完成。</p>

<h3>暹公佈移民限額　中國籍限一萬人　菲上院決暫緩討論減低稱民限額</h3>

<h3>香港總商會年會　商界領袖挾撃物價管制　與論反感斥爲不切實際</h3>
<p>〔路透社香港五日電〕香港社團領袖與一般人民間關於公共重大問題意見之不同，可由香港總商會年會席上之演辭申證之。商會主席卜內門公司之吉萊斯畢君：對於直接稅制度表示贊同，而對於供應貿易實業部則有批評，吉氏指出間接稅制度，使境况較差之人亦不得不負担稅額，而直接稅制度則較爲公允，渠對供應部之各種措施，如貿易及物價之管制，尤其是該部於去年之徵用布匹配給民衆，頗有批評，渠又抨擊進口商及居間商之取得過度利潤。吉氏於檢討香港之貿易時，謂近來進口船舶數量雖已激增，但較戰前記錄猶相去甚遠。關於工資問題，吉氏認爲在目前生活高昂下，資方雖同情勞方之處境，但彼等亦不得不顧及高工資將使香港物價與世界物價不能保持平衡之困難，渠估計工業界之工資及成本，較戰前漲起約四至五倍。吉氏旣表示開放”本之對外貿易確屬需要，此事已引起倫敦外交部及商務部之注意。另一商界領袖漢森氏繼之發言，表示希望恢復香港之自由企業制度。此項意見已引起一般民衆之反感，後者認爲貿易及物價之管制政策爲穩定生活之主要因素，故報紙已有斥前項演說爲不切實際者，就事實上言，港政府供應部之措施，雖不免侵犯所謂商界巨頭之利益，但就其成效言，至少尙不失爲適當之舉。</p>

<h3>專論　瞻望今後的衛生事業</h3>
<p>— 尹集廷</p>
<p>——爲衛生部成立曁中華醫學會第七屆年會作</p>
<p>輓近半年來，我國衛生事業有了重大的捩轉。去年十一月初衛生署召開全國衛生行政會議，對全國衛生行政有重要的議決和措施。本年五月，政府改組，衛生署擴大爲部，可知當局對民族健康的重視。五月五日，中華醫學會繼衛生部之成立召開第七屆年會於首都。前者總攬全國衛生行政，上承中央法令，督導和協助地方推行衛生事業；後者爲國內醫學界唯一的學術團體，包羅了國內權威醫界學者，以往在技術及行政方面曾對國家有許多俱獻。這次爲勝利後首次集會，且在衛生署改部的時候，度必有更多的供獻和成就，這是我們所盼望而祝賀的。</p>
<p>我國衛生事業自民國元年內務部成立，大總統令頒內務部官制，於內務部內設衛生司，主管衛生行政，爲我國衛生事業的基石。至民十七年，國民政府公佈全國衛生行政系統大綱，是年十一月一日，衛生部正式成立，爲衛生行政最高機構。惜曇花一現，衛生部又縮而爲衛生司，繼又改司爲署。抗戰期中，一仍此制，渡過了國難大關。雖受抗戰影響及人才和經濟的限制，仍能本艱苦與共之旨，在困難的環境下有所建樹。今茲擴充爲部，自應較諸以前更有一翻新作爲，新成　。</p>
<p>但我國地廣人衆，敎育又不普及，人民生活以農爲業，經濟生產落後，衛生設備簡陋，加之連年戰禍，損失巨大，衛生事業百廢待舉，謹以管見所及臚陳如左：</p>
<p>一·切實施行公醫制度　公醫制度的要義是國家對人民不分貧富，不分階級，都應同肅給予醫藥與衛生的照鷗和實惠。換句話說，就是政府應把醫藥衛生事業社會化，將它從一種彷彿是交易買賣的制度變成一種國家對人民的福利設施。國家之有醫師，猶之軍隊及警察。軍隊保衛國家領土主權，警察維持社會治安，醫師也就有保障國民健康的責任。故醫學的本旨，卽施仁於術，救人以危。我國醫藥衛生設備簡陋，人材缺乏，固爲衛生事業不良的主要原因：但以令日我國社會的畸形，私醫制度盛行，醫師相集都市，掛牌開業，自營生計，祗圖個人之便利，未能與整個民族的需要相配合。且取費昻貴，致使社會一般平民問津無門，實爲醫藥不能普及的重大障礙。公醫制度之推行，應切實管理，使醫務人員，派遣徵調，一本法令，與軍隊無二。在實施此制昨，提高醫務人員待遇，保障職業安全，使其無憂於生活，專心事業，尤爲應行注意之點。</p>
<p>實施　設計劃　傳染病斷送我國民族體質，損害經濟生產，衆所周知。若干年來，時疫流行，有增無减：卽以天花而論，我國發明種痘預防天花，爲時最早，時至今日，仍多流行。新法種痘自一七九六年秦納發明以來，僅百餘年，歐西名國，天花幾已絕跡；而我國患者仍多。天花免疫，百分可靠；尙且難於斷絕，其他無絕對預防之病，更勿庸談。台灣淪陷期中，傳染病管理有方，中醫絕跡；勝利以筏，傳染病亦隨之復原，霍亂隨之襲擾，死者頗衆，中醫復又盛行。這充分證明了我國衛生事業者的無能。爲什麽在異國民族的手中平安無事，拿回來立刻就變了質？砂眼的毛病，佈滿了我國每一角落：戰時重慶市民檢査，百分之八十以上患砂眼，三個瞎子中至少有一個是因爲砂眼而瞎的。多少人被砂眼害成了瞎子，失去了光明。此外，地方病更是影響我國民族健康的一個嚴重問題：華北的黑熱病，長江流域的住血吸虫，西南的瘧疾等等，歷年蔓延不絕，造成了高度的死亡率。其他急性傳染病之霍亂，傷寒，白喉之類，流行猖厥損失之大，何堪數計。故我國防疫事業，急不容緩，須完善計劃及調查，以疾病流行實際之需要而切實防範。除中央設有完善之防疫機構外，地方防疫事業，接近民間，易於了解疫情，直接捕滅，更不可略。中央地方之間，尤應羣策羣力，務使傳染病逐漸絕跡。</p>
<p>三·發展地方醫藥事業地方與人民唇齒相處。醫療事業，　應　愈。　國備省重溫舊夢立　　設施，尙未普及。若干省區面積廣大，而竟無省立醫院之設立，人民醫藥，極感困難。有者雖有唯一之省立醫院機構，但地區過大，人民衆多，實無補於實際。省立醫院之設施，應以地面人口之廣衆爲比例而設立，一省中每一行政區應設立較有規模之省立醫院。至我國之縣衛生院，更屬鳳毛麟角，旣有者以經費困難，人材缺乏，簡陋得可憐，今後應增加經費，提高待遇，每縣均應有衛生院之設施，幷以縣之區域而酌設分院。地方衛生事業，不但於人民疾病醫療，且可兼行衛生敎育，灌輸衛生常識，破除迷信，减少無益之耗費，防疫工作，亦可兼行，於整個衛生事業，關係實鉅。</p>
<p>四·實施藥品管理藥物爲衛生事業之主要部門，我國工業落後，新藥多仰舶來，至使投機藥商，商抬苛價；或檀造成品，五花八門，難以鑒別，不但貧者無力購買，且常花錢無效，其甚焉者，且反因而罹病，故藥品實有由政府管理之必要，實施國營；無醫師處方，不得擅售藥物。衛生機關，雖可兼售藥品，但須以政府定價爲限，不得擅自漲價。如是可避免藥物銷售的漫無管制，同時可使貧富均能得到實惠。</p>
<p>我國衛生事業，多端待興，以上所是，僅爲迫所急舉者。當此全國醫學界濟濟一堂，集會於首都之際，我們希望此一會議的召開必能有豐滿的成就和偉大的收穫。民族健康和國家前途，胥稱賴之？</p>

<h3>共黨閣員五人被迫辭職　法政局入新階段　賴瑪迪總理決繼續執政　法人必須嚴守紀律始能渡過難關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕巴黎五日廣播：法國今日開始其對共黨之「最大決鬥」。賴瑪迪總理於昨夜開除五共黨部長後，今日召集聯合內閣會議，共黨亦列席參加。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎四日電〕賴瑪迪所組聯合內閣，壽命不過三個月，昨夜排斥共產黨五閣員退出內閣。事前，議會以兩對一之票數表決信任政府案，共產黨議員投反對票。共黨去職五開員爲副總理陶雷士，國防部長皮盧，建設部長狄隆，勞動部長克羅薩與公共衛生部長馬期。其中四部長已由他人暫代，人民共和黨之戴才署理副總理，左派聯合黨之台爾博斯署理國防部長，人民共和黨之高斯德署理勞動部長，社會黨之莫許署理建設部長。賴瑪迪內閣如此局部改組之後，現包括社會黨，人民共和黨，急進社會黨及無黨派閣員兩人。內閣發言人稱，賴瑪迪不擬以改組內閣名單提請議會批准，故議會在六日例會前不復開會，下屆會議將討論馬達加斯加島暴動事件。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎四日電〕社會黨對於此次政渤，關係頗爲微妙，議會以三百六十票對一百八十六票贊成賴瑪迪凍結工資政策，共產黨議員投反對票，六十三議員棄權。事後，社會黨幹部即開會討論應付之辦法，表決結果，以十二票對九票主張賴瑪迪內閣應總辭職。社會黨領袖勃魯姆，與黨內左翼份子久已鑿枘，乃召集該黨議員舉行緊急會議，並向之發表熟烈演說，竭力主張排斥共產黨，最後付表決，以五十六票對九票，推翻黨幹部決議，主張賴瑪迪留任，並請共產黨閣員退出內閣。其時局勢混亂，許多閣員　共產黨閣員在內均於今夜到總理公署準備參加會議，始知會議已宣吿展期。共產黨領袖杜　　斯　議會宣稱：無論共產黨留在政府之內，或實行退出，仍自認爲政府之一黨。其意有仍在內閣之外支持政府之可能，社會黨領袖見風轉舵，乃決定不要共產黨，作獨自爲政之一試</p>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎四日電〕此間政界人士預測共黨退出政府之後，恐將使法國陷於混亂及革命之狀態中，蓋共黨可以控制工會，居於反對派地位後，則必引起工潮，麻痺法國。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎四日電〕法國在今後兩個月內將遭遇各種困難，主要爲糧食與幣制之困難，法國必須嚴守紀律，始能渡過難關，改變物價與提高工資將摧毁幣制，而摧毁幣制即等於破壞勞工階級也。另一問題爲議會政體問題，議會政體可以二方面觀之，第一，內閣總理與議會之間存有一項合同，政府所有官員對之均應尊重，否則即無議會政體可言；第二，任何閣員均必須受內閣團結一致原則之束縛。</p>
<h3>美援助希土方案　衆院已展開最後辯論　所作決定將具重大歷史意義</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕美政府提出四億美元援助希土案，衆院於今日展開最後辯論，對於歷史之形成，關係極爲重大。衆議員將覓取一項問題之答覆，即此案究將促成和平歟，抑將引起戰爭歟。此一問題，惟時間方能作確實解答。然衆院已因此遭遇兩條途徑，一爲現在採取行動，以遏止共產主義蔓延，一爲佇觀蘇美兩國能否融和其生活方式之歧異各點，究竟何去何從，今須擇定。參院經廿二日之劇列辯論後，已以六十七票對廿三票通過此案，決定現在採取行動。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕衆院討論援助希臘土耳其防止共產法案前夕，政府外交政策今日遭遇三重威脅，此種國內陣綫對國務卿馬歇爾挑釁，形勢之嚴重實爲大戰結束以來所僅見。三種威脅約如下述：（一）衆院共和黨員間對四億美元援助希土方案意見分歧殊甚。現擬建議將此事提交聯合國機構處理，且有一部份民主黨員爲之後盾。（二）參院對於政府所提三億五千萬美元國外救濟方案亦已發生爭執。衆院已將該款削减至二億美元。（三）衆院度支委員會聞將建議取消國務院宣傳與文化部門經費，包括「美國呼聲」廣播電台在內。馬歇爾準備應付此種挑釁，其下手方法首在恢復宣傳經費，認爲宣傳對於爭取國外人士了解美國外交政策不可或缺。並已邀請國會領袖廿一人，皆財政外交及交通方面之主要決策者，會同無綫電業要員明日舉行非常會議。爲遵行杜魯門總統及兩黨一致政策計、共和民主兩黨黨員均被邀赴會。</p>
<h3>英美報紙評論　法國政潮</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦五日電〕此間今日各報皆撰文詳論法國之政潮。「泰晤士報」力言不問該國領袖進行談判之結果如何，法國殆將進入歷史之新階段內。略謂：法國此次政潮並非僅係一種衝突，實對法國之將來政治或將發生決定性之影響。今聯合政府似有衰落之虞，尙望法國能善自爲之，但在目前僵局中，惟一所能乘機崛起者，殆將爲戴高樂其人。「每日電聞報」所言則更爲坦白，認爲昨日投信任票時之分裂情形，乃爲戴高樂造新機會，並謂法國今日當務之急，應使人民團結一致，謀經濟復興，以恢復法國過去之國際地位云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約四日電〕「紐約時報」今日社論稱：法國共產黨企圖引起閣潮，以推翻現政府，證明彼等不僅欲在法國且欲在整個西歐表示其力量。法國外長皮杜爾前在莫斯科時表示欲與西方國家一致之傾向，此舉激怒法國共產黨。再者，法國共產黨或者亦因杜魯門政策及戴高樂運動而驚恐。要之，法國大局嚴重，共產黨爲該國唯一大黨云。</p>
<h3>日內閣暫緩總辭　各黨積極籌組聯合內閣</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京五日電〕日本內閣書記官長林讓治頃語中央社記者稱：執政幾達一年之吉田茂內閣，辭職日期，將予延緩。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京五日電〕社會黨方而稱，黨魁片山哲即將發出請柬，邀請其他三黨領袖於內閣辭職後，召開四黨會議。</p>
<p>〔聯合社東京五日電〕日本內閣定於明日開會，草擬召集新議會於五月二十日開會詔書。各報預料屆時內閣亦將辭職。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京五日電〕社會黨所屬參衆兩院議員總會，四日開會，首由片山委員長致詞稱：社會黨今後旣立於第一黨之地位，自應負起解決一切國家困難與民族危機之重大責任。繼之，西尾書記長稱：社會黨在議院之議席雖未獲得過半數，但如獲得國民之擁戴，則我黨獲得首相及進行組閣一事已無何困難。實則高唱聯合內閣論者，乃不僅自由民主兩黨，即勞動大衆與財界中人亦有同感，本黨自當努力進行組成聯合內閣。其後就政局問題發言者甚多，結果均認爲首相應爲片山委員長，政策亦應實行社會黨之原定政策。</p>
<h3>傳蘇聯在白令海峽　舉行軍事演習　美籌備作二次北極區操演</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫　　日電〕　士廣播消息；蘇聯陸軍已在白令海峽阿拉斯加對岸之西伯里亞東北沿海，舉行春季演習，陸軍參加人數有廿五萬人，其後蘇聯太平洋艦隊及蒙古人民共和國軍隊亦將同往參加。按瑞士常有關於蘇聯動態之反共廣播消息，而在他處則無從探明，故或屬不確。今若千人士對其所述之演習人數，亦多表懷疑，蓋欲在西伯里亞東北沿海維持此龐大人數之行動及給養，均屬困難故也。但就蒙古軍隊亦參加一說而諭，則演習地點或即在西伯里亞之廣大區域內。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓四日電〕陸軍部今日宣布：美國將於今年十一月一日起，在阿拉斯加舉行第二次北極區操演，步兵與運兵飛機均將參加。陸軍航空隊司令狄佛斯稱，去冬之操演，令人相信步兵在該區應應加緊利用航空運輸。陸軍部此種宣布，適在海軍部要求國會批准造艦計劃之後，計劃中規定建造潛水艇與艦船，特別供北極海面之用。</p>
<h3>謀刺日共領袖　兇徒一人被捕</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社東京五日電〕報載日本警察頃已拘獲一企圖謀刺共產黨領袖之兇犯渡邊，該犯係於上月三十日擬自門司赴東京時被捕。當時在身上搜出手槍二枝，及子彈三十發，遂予扣押。警局加以嚴鞠，供認擬爲日本除去野坂，志賀，德田等共黨領袖，因「彼等使國家受物質上之困苦」云。</p>
<h3>蘇發行復興公債總額二百億盧布</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫期科四日電〕此間電台頃廣播消息：蘇聯內閣已通過法案，發行第二次國內公債，用以復興及發展蘇聯國民經濟，總數爲二百萬萬盧布，爲期二十年，自一九四七年十月一日發行，票面分爲五百·二百·一百五十。廿五等四種。</p>
<h3>猶太地下軍刦獄　囚犯二百廿八名在逃　英軍警出動從事搜索</h3>
<p>〔聯合社耶路撒冷四日電〕猶太地下鬥士今日衝破阿克爾監獄牆垣，釋放猶太與阿拉伯囚犯二百五十一人，死七人傷八人，是爲近代史上全世界最大一次越獄案。該獄在十字軍時曾被用作堡壘。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷五日電〕警察總局宣布，阿克爾監獄越獄囚犯之人數，計阿拉伯囚犯一九一名，猶太囚犯六十名。此次事件中，英方人員僅有警吏一名受重傷，軍官一名受輕傷，逃犯中有二十名係無期徒刑犯。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷五日電〕阿克爾監獄遭猶太恐怕份子襲擊，致有囚犯二百五十一名逃逸後，經軍警搜捕結果，尙有囚犯二二八名未獲。今晨軍隊曾將阿克爾城附近兩猶太區包圍，由持有逃犯名單之警察嚴密搜査。當局推測越獄之阿拉伯囚犯係向巴勒斯坦北部薩法特區逃逸，已在該地逐屋搜査。當刦獄時至少有恐怖份子及囚犯十五人被擊斃，廿五人受傷。被重新捕獲之囚犯有十九名，恐怕份子就逮者亦有十五名。昨日乃阿克爾監獄之探監日，故料或有伊爾根黨員僞爲探監運入手溜彈。</p>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷四日電〕猶太暴徒今日在阿克爾城，以炸藥炸破監獄牆垣後，刦出囚犯二百五十一人，其先恐怖份子携自動武器，分乘吉普二輛，駛入阿克爾城。約在同時中央監獄內，即上月猶太恐怖犯葛羅納被執行死刑之處，發生爆炸巨響，在監獄外並發見炸彈三枚，附近道路僑樑均埋置地雷。在爆炸聲中，監獄墙垣被炸一穴，囚犯即紛紛逸出。巴勒斯坦他處同日亦有恐怖活動，阿克爾城迤北英第六軍兵師之營房，被投炸彈五枚，損毁情形不詳。海發迤北有英軍用卡車一報觸地個，傷英兵五名。海發附近英兵一隊出浴歸營，中途遇伏，英軍選擊，斃暴徒五名，英方死傷不詳。</p>

<h3>美衆際度支委會</h3>
<p>主張削减混合預算數額</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕衆院度支委員會今日提議政府三部院及聯邦法庭之一九四八年度混合預算案，核减百分之二十三。此案總額爲五億三千五百萬元，已由委員會提交衆院討論，並附報吿書，措辭嚴峻，警吿聯邦各機關不得存「糜費心理」。委員會提議要點爲撤銷國務院新聞與文化關係司，馬歇爾國務卿雖中言需要該司以對抗海外反美宣傳，但委員會表決結果，將國務院一九四八年度經費中該司經費三千一百三十八萬一千二百二十元完全删除。如果參衆兩院均予同意，則以對蘇爲主要目的之「美國呼聲」廣播，將告終止。委員會提議其他經費之核减額，包括：（一）菲律賓復興經費自五千四百九十一萬二千元减爲四千五百萬元；（二）民用航空管理局經費自一億八千九百九十九萬四千元减爲一億一千九百五十萬〇七千元；（三）國內外商業局經費自一千一百六十七萬五千元减爲七百萬元。</p>

<h3>吳市長徇米商要求　食米恢復自由買賣</h3>
<p>市民憑戶籍證每半月購米一斗</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕食米限價取消，昨起已准予恢復自由買賣。一面社會局繼續按日拋售九千包，以供米號計戶配售之需，價格決仍維持十六萬八千。</p>
<p>昨日上午八時半，米業代表瞿振華，徐頌仁，査寳三，胡文安，蔡聲明等偕往市府晋謁吳市長，社會局糧食科長吉明齋亦在座。各米商代表紛紛陳述因食米受管制後所引起之實際困難情形，要求准予恢復自由買賣。經一小時之硏討，吳市長終決定取消限價，允許恢復自由買賣。惟望米商自行約束，務使漲風趨平。代表等當保證恢復自由買賣後，決不亂抬價格，一本良心經營。</p>
<p>據瞿振華吿記者：市塲米荒現像，並非因來源問題。實係受管制後人心恐慌所致。日前產區曾來滬米船一百艘以上，惟均爲逃避限價管制而流入黑市，爲人大量購去。正當商人反而無法採購，致造成今日米市之混亂現像。今後旣可自由買賣，一面市府仍照常以十六萬八千元價配米，相信人心即可因此安定。</p>
<p>記者旋訪吳市長，據吿：食米恢復自由買賣後，市府仍按日拋九千包以供配售。由主管機關將每日出倉食米數量與配售之米號列單公佈，同時分發各警察分局與區公所。由警局派員會同區民代表監督米號如數發售，使不致有藏匿囤積等情。凡升斗小民可憑戶籍證向米號於半月內購米一斗，每戶以五斗爲限。戶籍證上需寫明購買日期及數量，由米號錄下逐日彙報區公所及警局。至不願憑證購買或欲購買較多者可向自由市塲得之。</p>
<p>昨南北兩市塲共到貨二六八七石。河下貨亦有五千餘石。米商代表昨自動將白粳市塲交易價暫限廿四萬，門售以廿五萬爲度，但是項價格無人肯買出。而米號則因所領配米少，門前排隊來購之市民多，每易引起糾紛，故昨日多不願登記經售是項配米。</p>
<h3>麵粉食油一致狂漲</h3>
<p>昨麵粉狂漲萬餘無，洋粉飛跳近二萬元，麩皮去化甚暢，猛騰一萬餘元。豆餅交易濃旺，續漲四五千元。黄豆步升六七千元，生仁去路活潑，奔騰萬餘元。芝蔴消路極暢，挺進萬餘元。</p>
<p>紅糧苞米酒精去化蟬聯，均高二三千元。蠶豆物稀爲貴，疾進萬元。赤豆到消兩稀，暫無軒輊。菉豆堅定之格。</p>
<p>油市買氣甚盛，飛黄騰達，暴漲四五萬元。各糧展開全面漲風</p>

<p>公債昨漲後有回，統丙晨開一九三〇〇元，低價一八六〇〇元，高價達二一五〇〇。午刻在一九五〇〇元左右徘徊，五一二室五五五室及潤德有納，五五〇室五〇三室及散多出籠，結果較上週六計甲乙丁戊微挫二三百元，統內微升二百元，成交約一千二百餘萬。</p>
<h3>外股買多見高</h3>
<p>外股昨以洋行帮以及銀錢業等大衆購買，藉以保持幣値。怡紗自八〇〇〇〇，英聯自一一八〇〇〇元，開後一路上升，近午稍盤，午後港匯報好，繼續見高，怡紗達八五八〇〇元，英聯達　一四七〇〇〇元，而後稍回。銀行帮對鋼業有買胃，證劵帮中人，獲利頗多了結，結果較上週六計英聯會德豐各升二成强，怡紗怡啤航業鋼業電話開平各升一成强，業廣紙業微升迄半成不等，一墾植及橡皮股所漲亦勁。</p>
<h3>白糖市勢又緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市以台公司復配之期迄未決定，故白糖疲而復堅。秘魯細砂回至四十三萬五六千元升萬餘元，二四粗白無更動，油包退二萬元，二〇中砂亦升萬餘元，車白升萬餘元至數千元，靑糖較平。汕提靑廿七萬元，黄江靑廿六萬五千元，高順德靑廿六萬五千元至廿六萬元。刁靑廿五萬五千元至廿四萬元，小三五千元，中山片靑廿五萬七千元，貨質較高。興化白四十一萬元，次之四十萬元至三十九萬元，興赤三十一萬元，次之三十萬元至廿九萬五千元。</p>

<h3>華股散賣略動　市勢初盤後堅</h3>
<p>華股昨多方雖有一部份了結，散賣略有活動，中途呈欲進無力之象，但港市報高，籌碼仍涸，美亞等漲停外，永紗在最後亦吿堅俏。</p>
<p>晨開　見昂，遞永紗開後由一四二號一六九號九四號二三二號二〇五號一五二號俱進，美亞在開股東臨時會之利買訊下，首先漲停。景綸商務亦吿漲停，籌碼甚涸，而永紗漲到六五四〇元。一八五號一二號二一八號乘高了結，退至六四六〇元。一四二號一五二號購買，升爲六五五八〇元。永業亦吿漲停。一〇五號八三號九七號八五號脫手，再退爲六五〇〇元，入後形成徘徊之局者甚久。</p>
<p>十時四十分後，因傳金鈔黑市見倘，外股猛躍之訊，人心始形重振。八九號九九號一四號三六號七六號一九七號俱進，遞永紗乃漲到六六四〇元。三三號一九一號一七九號一二九號一五四號二三一號逢高有售，尤以一二九號買胃最湧，回降至六四八〇元。一一二號八九號一四五號七七號一五三號七六號二二四號　進，人心尙定，水泥亦吿漲停。近午永紗再升至六六〇〇元外，一二九號仍有賣出。</p>
<p>午刻在六五五〇元左右徘徊，結果較上週六計華豐平平，永紗景福升半成，新光勤興中法新華微升，信和永公升一成，美亞漲停。遞交計華豐平平，美亞漲停，永紗信和永公景福勤興各漲半成強。冷股計水泥商務漲達限度，新亞中絲景綸榮豐漲停後有回，火柴統益各升一成弱，餘股亦漲起半成左右。</p>

<h3>本月配粉辦法　一切照舊辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕福新麵粉廠負責人榮敬仁，近爲接洽維持本市五月份配粉事，曾晋京與糧政當局，有所洽商，頃已公畢返滬。據談：本月份本市配粉辦法，一切照舊辦理。配價配量，暫不變更云。</p>
<h3>紹酒醖釀新價</h3>
<p>紹酒以米價陡漲，來貨成本驟增，雖逐步上升，但仍不克補抵後貨，昨市暫無交易，同業正集議新價中。</p>
<h3>棉紗客銷仍健　喊價繼續增高</h3>
<p>——本街各廠納為較淡——</p>
<p>棉紗昨（五日）紡建照例開售四十二支天女九九八萬，四十支五子八八六萬，三十二支仙桃六九六萬，二十支水月四六〇萬元，十六支飛虎四一六萬，十支童子軍三二九萬，開價均與上期無何變動。</p>
<p>塲中喊價依然上升，尤以十六支及二十支粗紗漲勢更强，較之上日軋升四五十萬元。細紗亦漲一二十萬元，四十二支藍鳳做高至一千四百二十萬元，最後價爲一千三百九十萬元，聞客帮頗有添辦，惟本街廠家納胃較淡，而執貨者仍有居奇之勢。</p>
<p>查獲囤紗一千餘包</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕警備司令部經濟組爲平抑紗價，禁止囤積，限令自五月一日起，凡査出紗商存紗在一個半月以上者，一律强迫以原價售還政府。茲限期已屆，連日經濟組派員分査廠商倉庫，據悉，自五月一日至三日止，査出存紗在一個半月以上者達一千餘包之多，甚至且有去年二月份購進而迄今仍未出售者，現經濟組一方面繼續調査，同時，已將此類蔑視法令之廠商及其存紗數量列表呈報宣司令，將依前令通知紡管會照原價收回云。</p>
<h3>美金庫券充凖備金　財部規定辦法</h3>
<p>關於本市各行莊將美金庫劵抵充國行存款準備金一部，國行昨已接奉財政部頒布明命，其辦法如次：</p>
<p>（一）凡各地銀行錢莊及信託公司，應行繳存中央銀行之存款準備金，其半數得以行莊公司自己所有之卅六年度短期庫券作爲代替品。</p>
<p>（二）凡每一行莊及信託公司，以此項庫券繳充準備金，滿應繳額之半數後，每逢因左款增减，依照財部原有規定，應增繳準備，或得收回準備金之一部份時，其增繳或收回金額，均應以國幣收付之。但每年一月份及七月份，各行莊公司以前坍繳現金或收回現金，致其所繳庫劵，已超過應繳準備金總額之半數者，應於該月份將超過金額，用現金換回之。其不滿半數者，得於該月份用此項庫劵繳足半數，換回現金。</p>
<h3>輸出推廣委會通過要案兩起</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出推廣委員會執委會，於昨日下午三時許，假中央銀行舉行會議。副主委陳光甫，因事未到，由伍嗣達代主席，討論至七時三十分散會。當通過要案二起：（一）加工原料進口辦法，共分四程序辦理。諸凡對准許進口數量，違反辦法之罰則，均有規定。該項辦法，尙待提交輸管會討論核定。（二）事豆，芝蔴，生仁，菜籽及其榨油之出口，如在海關頒行定量許可出口令以前，業已成交之貿易，准在不超過國際糧食緊急處理委員會中，我國所應攤派之數額下，予以轍出云。</p>
<h3>人造絲堅昂</h3>
<p>人造絲雖有配售消息，但售價不免提高，故昨日人心頗堅昂，一二〇號高山有光，開盤即喊一千九百萬元，收盤爲八百八十萬元，上午終在（價內盤旋，成交不過一二箱。下午喊價小去二十萬元，結果仍比上週末大五十萬元，廠經無甚變化，B字等級做開十包，價二千一百萬元，其餘均乏成交。綢貸除大誠格子　　始堅後疲外，其他各貨　無上落。</p>
<h3>紡建信紗</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售紗，共售一八六七件，全部售予廠商，廠商申請單共七八四張。</p>
<h3>棉布新買仍活</h3>
<p>棉布市况初開平穩，塲上互做仍以新買戶居多，客帮收吸胃口轉呆，同業做開現貨棧單，頗呈活躍，致市氣依然堅挺。四君子金印嗶嘰自廿九萬六千元喊高至廿九萬八千元，進戶爭先恐後，旋以成交者少，始轉平定。十二磅龍頭細布由三十一萬亦漲至卅二萬五千元，五福卅萬零五千元升二萬餘元，二十支特細布由廿五萬一千元升至五千元，其餘色布及士林等市亦挺俏。</p>
<h3>茶市交易呆滯</h3>
<p>專供外銷之紅綠茶，本市各出口行鑒於目前國外售價低於國內，致咸取袖手旁觀之態度，因此連日交易仍極呆滯。其趨勢在人心無力振作中，賡續虛浮，脚地依然岌岌可危。至於各種內銷花色，去化亦屬乏整，惟因賣戶心思尙吿安定，過程遂鮮起仆。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕我國四大出口貨之茶葉，自與國外售價倒懸不一後，外銷已呈偃伏之狀，而邇來各產區之新茶；漸若雨後春筍，惟茶商因陳茶尙未消罄，對新貨大都裹足不前，故聞刻下產區市面，並不活潑云。</p>
<h3>工業原料狂騰</h3>
<p>工業原料，昨市再度全面飛騰，下市成交寥寥，執貨者人心之堅得未曾有，求買者雖在高價，亦難進購。燒碱市面，都看一千五百萬，市塲異口同聲，喊價亦亂。原料行商雖稱八百五十萬，但限於買進，向購則云無貨，N松香，凡士林等，以漲勢尙只六成，故引起買氣，昨市亦猛騰至烈。</p>

<h3>雨花台畔看谷壽夫行刑</h3>
<p>— 本報特約記者者丁匡華</p>
<p>南京四月廿七日快訊</p>
<p>谷壽天是南京大屠殺案的劊子手，終於於在今日伏法在南京人的面前，雖然他已執行槍決，却仍然不能補償那些無辜的死難者的損失。中華門雨花台，是當日谷壽夫咤叱風雲的所在，今天却作了他殺身的刑塲。他會想到：「山川改觀，草木依然，同一地區，兩樣場面」的悽慘，讀武者終不可免，天網恢恢，不僅南京人稱快，「人道」「正義」亦在向殘暴者予莫大的打擊。</p>
<p>社色遽變吞吞吐吐</p>
<p>今天早上，小營戰犯拘留所也開了臨時法庭，石美瑜庭長曁軍法官多人，蒞臨監視，九時十分陳光虞檢察官曁書記官張殿桐升庭，隨將谷犯由監中提出，今天谷壽夫仍那樣倔强。檢察官循例詢問了被吿姓名，年齡，籍貫，及經歷，幷將被吿親屬寄來之平安家信擲給他，俟被吿閱學後，即問。「對於這幾封家信須要回信嗎？」谷壽夫至此神色遽變，呑呑吐吐的答道：「望能讓我寫」。說話的時候，喉嚨哽咽，已是言不成聲了。谷犯於獲得允准後，即於身上掏出鉛筆，戰戰兢兢，寫着永訣人世最後的幾封信。寫完信，檢察官便宣讀國府批示示「據國防部戰犯審判軍事法庭本年三月十九日國（三六）審字第一〇七號呈曁附件，均悉·査被吿谷壽夫在作戰期間，共同縱乒屠殺俘虜及非戰鬥人員，幷强姦搶劫破壞財產，旣據訊明確實，處以死刑，尙無不當，應予照准。」谷犯仍强辯如故，檢察官厭其喋喋不休，再度追問被吿對家庭有無遺書，谷犯不得已，乃索取紙張草留遺言。</p>
<p>遺書一封悲淚兩行</p>
<p>這時，臨時法庭裏數百隻眼睛，都集中在谷犯的身上，看他如何寫着最後的遺言。記者靠近谷犯旁邊，祗見一位日文翻譯官念着谷犯正在寫的文字。記者這時乃用速記把原文記下來，下面就是他給他妻子的遺書：「給谷梅子。谷壽夫昭和廿三年四月十六日，我的死刑快要執行了。在還不知道執行前，我曾另外寫好一信，現在，與此遺書一併作爲永別的紀念。梅子！我們不能偕老，但你已盡了內助的責任，我得深深感激。在中國方面的裁判下，現在我將被執行死刑，實在是遺憾的事。但我是否犯了國際的罪行，相信將有大白的一天。我個人幷沒有關係，雖被槍決在雨花台，但總算已盡了最後的報國責任。克已及近孝兩君，請多帮助他們，淸子及秀子都要撫育他們成爲有用的人。我雖然身死異域，但靈魂終會飛返家鄕。同在是四月廿六日正午，我向　致別後，便將永訣。願各位都能幸福。現在，我還能够站着，向各位叙別，但不一會，我便將長倒地下，這是不幸的，但也是命運所使然。走完了人生的旅途了，我最後的行狀，高橋中將及小笠原參謀都會見到的，他們可以吿訴你。六十六歲成了我生命上最後的一年，但是一直到　　，我都認爲幷沒有錯。努力到最後的最後，但終被槍斃，實是憾事。親愛的梅子，永遠的再會吧！請將我的遺骸火葬後，將骨灰帶回去。願谷家幸福！梅子，永別了！」家信寫完後隨即另外寫了幾旬話，向戰犯磯谷，土橋，內田，高橋等難友致別。寫着的時候，倒還鎭靜，然而當他將遺書雙手捧呈給檢察官的時候，兩眼是淚水盈盈了，雖則沒有掉淚，然而這個惡魔在臨死以前，內心的惑觸之深，不難想見。</p>
<p>清理遺物上足小氣</p>
<p>這時已是十時五十分了，谷壽夫要求到拘留所中去整理遺物檢察官未便允准，僅允許他在法庭之上淸理，三十分鐘後，勤務兵提着個標準日本式綠白花色的大包袱放在被吿欄旁，這時的景象，正像一個傭工辭別了他的主人一樣，他押解來華時，所穿的那件黑大衣和灰呢帽也在其中，這時谷壽夫蹲在地上一件件慢慢的整理，將所有的什物，分成了三份，一份是託聯絡班轉回日本，交給他的家屬，另一包破衣，是分贈在押的各同僚，其中有一件六成新的羊毛褲子和一雙襪子，特別指定贈予戰犯高橋中將，另外有一支黑桿鋼筆，是要還給聯絡班的日人小笠原者，另外還有一本爲了受審時，向國防部借用的地圖也交給庭上請轉還給國防部，在這一個過程中，法庭上對他仍很自由，祗要他還能想得到的物件，都由勤務兵去給他找來，寫遺書時拘留所黄所長，還特意請他吸了一支黄錫包的紙烟，這也可說是他這一生最後的一次享受吧！在他整理遺物時，他充分的表現出日本人的小氣，連抽屜中放着的幾個火柴盒，都要搖搖看，盒還剩着幾根火柴，他也把它放在包袱內，時間就這樣的一分一秒飛逝了過去。他的生命也愈顯得短促，這時他自知快要執行了，即把那雙黑棉鞋脫下，換上了那雙黑皮鞋，兩隻手上又套了曾用以掌握指揮刀的那付米色手套，在檢察官發出押赴刑塲的命令後，又戴上了那頂舊呢帽，由監刑的憲兵挾持着谷的雙臂推上停放在院內，押赴刑塲的大卡車上去。</p>
<p>刑車過處人山人海</p>
<p>車子出了小營拘留所，經過珠江路碑亭巷大行宮，太平路，建康路，中華路，至中華門，再來了一次「出城式」，直駛中華門外雨花台刑塲，這一刹那間，正不知谷犯又引起了若干的回憶。谷犯站在卡車的前半截，雙手伏在車頂上，沿途看着戰犯法庭在散發着槍斃他的油印佈吿。每條街上，都引起了一陣陣的　動，尾隨着刑車的人數，成千成萬，都想一看南京大屠殺案罪魁伏誅的最後一幕</p>
<p>砰的一槍掌聲四起</p>
<p>刑車在行駛的途中，帶度甚爲緩慢，馬降上觀看的人，是越擠越多。凡是經過的地方，每個人都暫時擱置了他的工作，仰頭瞻望。三山街上更有不少的人僱了野鷄汽車趕到雨花台，雨花合山頭已早在兩小時前堆砌成人山了，刑車駛近刑塲時，整個中華門外的交通都已遮斷，十一時三十五分已抵刑塲。山頭上傳來一片掌聲，臨死不悟的惡魔，再也保持不住他的鎮定，一張蒼白而又十分難看的臉，顯然的表示他惶恐了，憲兵架他走了十嵊步路停下來，讓記者舞在他死前的一剎那，用「開麥拉」留下他的一副兇容，最後才面北背南的讓他站在刑塲上，兩個扶住他的憲兵，却被他用手牢牢的握緊，似乎是在求他們兩人救他的命似的，顯出那副可憐相，檢察官命令執行後，槍手即對準谷犯的後腦「砰」的一聲，谷犯這樣即臥在地上，山上的人羣中報以絕大的掌聲。積了十年的血償，今天總算在槍響的時候　回了一點，然而想起以一個谷壽夫來抵償四十萬人的寃仇，實在太便宜他了，不過，他終於抵命了，這倒也大快人心了。</p>
<p>（上）谷壽夫行刑之際，（下）行刑之後</p>
<h3>星期論壇　印度政局的瞻望</h3>
<p>— 歐陽中庸</p>
<p>今年二月廿二日，英首相艾德禮在下院宣佈，自明年六月一日起，英國從印度撤退。這是英印關係史上新頁的開始。追溯過去英國在印之種種政治革新及建議，始終不能滿足印度民族主義的願望，其癥結乃在英國從朱明確宣佈將政權移交印度的時日，艾德禮首相斷然的聲明，帶來了印度光明的前途，我們不難想像，印度民族志士將如何興高彩烈，手舞足蹈，六十年來，國民大會黨艱辛奮鬥所蘄求的「完全獨立」的目標，實現非遙，安得不慶幸歡欣！</p>
<p>然一返觀印度現實，宗派分歧，內在矛盾，在在阻礙統一。一方面，印回衝突，似已達到無可妥協的境地，回敎聯盟，堅持「巴基斯坦」，與印度敎徒的「印度斯坦」分離，一方面，則割裂印度政治地理，佔全印領土五分之二，星棋羅布爲數五百六十二的印度藩邦，保持中世紀以來的君主傳統，旁觀印回衝突，隱然自重，對未來印度聯合，態度漠然，故印度光明的遠景，仍被暗淡的陰影所遮蔽，從印度臨時政府到英國將政權移交印度負責，是印度政治上靑黄不接的過渡時期，潛伏的內在矛盾，愈趨明銳，國大與回盟的政治鬥爭，仍在猛烈進行，未來獨立的印度，便將在這複雜紛歧的情况中蛻化。</p>
<p>未來獨立的印度，將以「統一的獨立十權共和國」的姿態出現！抑或以「巴基斯坦」與「印度斯坦」的兩個主權國的形式產生？抑或以更多的獨立邦，類似大英帝國內自治領的形態演出？英國的統治權，將移交於一個印度政府？或數個印度政府？將以何種程序移交？這些基本問題，便是英，印，回，藩邦目前所各自考慮互相爭執與共同商議的問題。</p>
<p>在過渡時期中，推動英屬印度行政的責任，由尼赫魯爲副揆的印度臨時政府負之，　於制定印度未來憲法，以便誕生新政府，接收英方移交政權的責任，便由制憲會議負之。與國大黨對立的回盟，旣參加印度臨時政府的主管部，却又屢次拒絕派代表加入決定印度前途的制憲會議，其參加臨時政府，想係效法國大黨參加一九三七——三九省行政的對英方案「內部阻撓」的政策，不與尼赫魯氏及國大黨精誠合作。尼赫魯氏對內感回盟閣員的豐肘與磨擦，對外分心於迷漫各地的印回流血鬥爭，應付不暇，興建難行，故尼赫魯向英建議，使臨時政府，對制憲會議負責，而使制憲會議，成爲一主權之機構，以追使回盟加入制憲會議，或退出臨時政府。</p>
<p>回盟始終拒不加入制憲會議，固然影響制憲之圓滑進行，更爲英國保守黨死硬派張目。邱吉爾批評制憲會議，如無回盟參加，僅足代表印度敎徒，而不能代表印度，則其決定，不値得英內閣之尊重。制憲會議主席普拉薩，乃對之作重要聲明，列舉上次制憲會議代表的成份。計二九六名由選舉選出之會員中，出席者二一〇名；印度敎徒名額一六〇名，出席者一五五名；階級代表三三名，出席者三〇名；基督敎徒七名，出席者六名；落後部落民族五名，英印混血種五名，錫克敎徒（即爲英人任巡捕軍警包頭留鬚者，均屬此敎，）五名，帕西人（即從波斯移來的拜火敎徒，總數十一萬五千人，集中於孟買一地，在工商方面，具雄厚資力，）三名，全數出席；回敎徒八十名，出席者四名；故除回盟人士，未參加外，制憲會議，代表各宗派，各階級，各種族，邱吉爾的批評，實含惡意。制憲會議已經兩度休會，以期回敎聯盟的參加，四月廿八日，復舉行第三次大會，尼赫魯於會中提議，歡迎各藩邦自由參加，祖已參加會議之藩邦，僅僅八個，其中藩王指派之代表五人，民選代表十六人。較高級之藩邦，願意於英國離印後，成爲獨立國家，他們當然不會參加制憲會議。尼赫魯的呼籲，恐難打動藩王的愛國心，尤其是回敎的藩王。「利害」與「安全」，是藩王們考慮參加制憲會議與否的權衡，因爲他們深悉，一且加入統一的印度中央聯邦政府，藩王許多特權，便要轉移於中央政府，或受限制。在這次制憲會議中，回盟仍拒絕參加，上週回明第二號領袖阿里漢已宣佈：「制憲會議，已死亡而不能活復，」故國大黨期待回盟參加會議之希望，已成泡影。</p>
<p>綜合最近印局發展的情况，加以分析，可知印度，雖臨獨立之門，但走向分治之路。向以統一合治爲鵠的之國大黨領袖，處此情况下，祗好遷就現實。目前國大黨對「巴基斯坦」的態度，已非爲對其應否實現而爭執，而爲其如何實施之折衝。印督蒙巴頓與甘地眞納等四週來所商談者，即爲徵詢衆意，草擬印回分治之綱領，及英方政權移交之步驟。而分治印度之方式有二；一爲完全之分治，即眞納氏巴基斯坦主張之全部實施，就現在省境爲劃分綫，西部包括西北邊省，俾路支，辛德省，旁遮普省，東部包括孟加拉及阿薩密省；一爲有條件之分治，即巴基斯坦省份中錫克敎徒汲印度敎徒佔多數之縣區，應從巴基斯坦分出，　加入「印度斯坦，」旁遮普省之錫克敎徒，即對眞納之「巴基斯坦，」提出「錫克斯坦」分治之呼號，又西北邊省等地的回敎徒，在號稱「邊疆甘地」的阿布度加發漢領導下，素來擁議國大黨，則當舉行邊省全體公民投票，以決定其是否願加入「巴基斯坦。」</p>
<p>在英國統治下的印度，政區分爲二：即英屬印度十一行省‘與印度藩邦。英方公佈一九三五年印度政府法案，即印度的憲法，分爲兩部，省自治部份，已經十一省實行，中央聯邦政府部份，因國大回盟藩邦三方意見不一，懸而未決，故現在印度德里中央政府，乃循一九一九年之印度政府法案行事。現在德里開會之制憲會議，即在制定印度獨立後之新憲法，以便政權之移交，雖因回盟之拒絕參加制憲，堅持巴基斯坦分治，但制憲會議旣經包括回敎聯盟外之各宗派階級種族及少數藩邦，實代表印度大多數意見，其制憲進行，將更積極。憲法內容，將適應印度複雜環境，在原則上，期能適用於全印度，不論其爲原英屬行省或藩邦，在原則上，將使其能適用於各個地域。故獨立後之印度，將有三個政治區分出現，即「印度斯坦，」「巴基斯坦，」「藩邦集團，」此三者，爲共同軍事防禦，及經濟互助起見，可能組成一極鬆懈的「邦聯。」</p>
<p>英首相艾總禮，於下院發表英將退出印度聲明時，已料想到印度內部可能發生的糾紛，故其聲明之內容，値得再行推敲，其要點爲：（一）英國希望印度各大黨和衷共濟，組成政府，繼承英國統治；（二）在撤退以前過渡期中，魏菲爾總督免職，蒙巴頓勛爵繼任；（三）去年英內閣訪印代表團所提制憲案及原則，並無變動；（四）如印度各黨在撤退期至，而仍然不能制定憲法，則英國或將統治權移交於各省政府；（五）英國無意將各藩邦的統治權與義務，移交印度中央政府，在過渡期內，英王與各藩邦關係，將由協定予以調整。這幾點可說是英國撤退印度所依據的幾項原則。値得注意的有三點：即；（一）英方不加壓力於任何一方，以促進統一，但希望印度各大黨，自行妥協商議，組成政府，繼承英國統治；（二）即到期制憲不成，印度政府難立，亦將統治權，移交現在英屬十一行省；（三）英國對藩邦之最高權力仍在，不因英國之撤退而消失，亦不因英國之將印度統治權移交印度政府而隨之轉移。</p>
<p>英國確切聲明定期退出印度，給予印度獨立，實値得舉世贊美，然而爲爭取獨立，犧牲統一，因獨立而隨帶分裂，實不能不爲印度，這是英國統治印度兩百多年的歷史因素所造成。</p>
<p>英國統治印度，使全印度除少數地區外在一個中權下生活，爲以往印史之所難能，而開印度政治之創舉，英國統治，使印度社會安定，無兵革內爭，亦爲事實，英國之政治措施，敎育啓發，亦有助於印度民族主義之成長，然而深長思之，英國統治，未能致力於印度宗派之融合及歧異之調和，而反有容忍護持，推波助瀾，使相尅制之娥，此爲統治者的安全着想，固未可厚非，但爲印度民族之前途着想，則爲厲階。數月來印回流血慘劇，益使反動派振振有詞，證說英國統治之合法與必要，印度軍隊，印人無升至旅長者，英人雖交還印度政權，軍權則仍不能不依賴印軍總司令英將歐慶來，蓋一則印軍人階級底而無資望，二則印敎徒或回敎徒任斯職，勢將引起宗派之糾紛，即此一例，亦可見印度合治固困難，而分治亦問題頗多。我們且注意以後印度政局的發展罷！</p>

<h3>單身漢的懺悔</h3>
<p>— 德·蘇德曼著·林鳳藻譯</p>
<p>啊，親愛的太太，這裏眞好，又可以同你在一起，很平靜的坐在這舒服的椅子上，跟你隨便談談了。謝天謝地，假期的紛擾過去了，你又可以有一點閒功夫跟我在一起了。</p>
<p>啊，這耶穌聖誕的季節！相信這是魔鬼把它興了起來，特別給我們單身漢搗亂的，使我們沒有家的人感到生活的無聊。這對於人家是快樂之源，對於我們眞是一種痛苦。當然咯，當然咯，我們單身漢並不每個都是孤單的，我們中間大部分人可以使人家快樂，而自己也得到快樂。可是這與人家共同享受的快樂，却帶着苦味；一半呢，因爲我們班是嘲訕的批評自己，另一半呢，因爲我們有那酸性的期望：這期望，我可以說，不是想家，而是想結婚。</p>
<p>你要問了：爲什麽不早些跑米，把心裏要說的話和盤托出呢？你是當於同情的人；當大部分女子給我怨恨的時候，你總是很慷慨的給我安慰。啊，你要知道，這事情並不簡單。在這次聖誕節的第三天，你猜準了我的心，把史拜德那本嘮叨得有趣的『孤單的小麻雀』送給我；你知道史公在那本書裏講些什麽？他說，『眞正的單身漢是不受人家安慰的，他在不快樂以後！就願意繼續不快樂。』</p>
<p>除了史拜德說的孤單的小麻雀以外，還有一種年老的單身漢，是人們家裏的朋友。我的意思並不指那些專門破壞人家家庭的人：那些人在享受人家爐火的時候，假仁假義的給人家暗示着他們的鬼胎。我並不指這種人，我是指孩子們的好伯伯，好叔叔，孩子們的爸爸的老同學；這些人把孩子擱在腿上撫弄着，同時很恭敬的對他媽媽朗誦晚報上的故事——故事中不正經的地方當然是省略了的。</p>
<p>我知道有許多人老替朋友的家庭服務，這些人就在那家庭裏過日子，跟可愛的女子在一起，心裏非常愛慕，而又毫無慾望。</p>
<p>你不信我的話嗎？啊，大槪你不贊成「奄無慾望」這幾個字罷？你也許是對的。在最馴服的心底裏，也許躲着一個粗野的欲望，不過你要知道，這慾望是給控制着的。</p>
<p>我可以給你一個例子。我吿訴你：就在這大除夕，兩個老人談些什麽話。你不准問我如何知道他們的談話，你也不能把這話告訴別人。要不要就開始？</p>
<p>請你先想像一個情景。一間舊式佈置的屋子，天花板很高，上面掛着一盞擦得亮亮的洋燈，很像在應用煤油以前我們父親們用的洋燈，外面圍着綠色的罩子，這屋子裏是暗暗的。燈光正照着一個圓桌，桌上舖着一塊白布，上面放着各種原料，是預備調製新年的甜酒用的；桌布中間有幾點油漬，慢慢的在擴大着。</p>
<p>這兩位老先生，就在那裏坐着，一半的身體就在這模糊的綠色燈光之下。他們是過去一代霉　的遺跡，每個人戰慄的坍在那裏，每個人糢糊的望着空間，臉上露着老年的無必聊。其中一位是主人，是一個軍人，一看他的外表就知道了。他頸上戴着一條貼得緊緊的圍巾；他的上唇有幾根翹着的　鬚，但此外却刮得光光的；他的眉毛正擠成一假軍官生氣的樣子。他在一個轉椅上面，縮成一團，兩乎正握着那轉椅的搖手柄，很像握着一根彎曲的手杖。他坐在那裏動也不動，除了他的下吧不住的上下移動，做着咱喚的動你。另外一位就在軍人旁邊的沙發上坐着；他是個瘦瘦的　個子，肩膀很窄，頭　輪　很　着，額部很寬，像一個思想家。他從一個很長的烟管裏隨便抽了幾口烟，　斗快要熄了。他的面的配着　　的卷髮，光滑　燥的皮膚上，堆着無數細小的縐紋，可是這藕紋裏藏着一個柔軟而平靜的微笑。只有拋棄一切歸於平靜的老年人，才有這種笑容</p>
<p>他們兩個坐着沒有講話。在這靜默中，你可以聽到燈油燃燒的一些勃勃之聲，與烟斗裏烟油的勃勃之聲混在一起。過了一回，在背後黑暗中，墻上的鐘擦的」響，打了十一下。</p>
<p>「這差不多是你調製甜酒的時候了，」那個有思想家頭腦的人說。他的聲調很軟，有些抖。</p>
<p>『你簡直沒有懂得她』客人咕嚕着。在他的兩個嘴角上現出一個被抑制着的反感，他對他的朋友望了好久，但他的神情很和順，很凄慘，好像他的心靈上負着一個自己意識到的罪過。</p>
<p>靜然了一回，他開始講了：</p>
<p>『喂，佛朗茲，我要吿訴你一件事－這件事老在我心上像老鼠一般的咬着好久了。我不能把這件事帶到墳墓裏去」。</p>
<p>『那麽，趕快開頭罷』，佛朗茲說。手裏拿起靠着轉椅的長烟管，把烟草裝進了烟斗。</p>
<p>「有一回－發生了一件事－在我與－你太太之間』。</p>
<p>『別開玩笑了，博士先生』，佛朗茲說。</p>
<p>『我是一本正經的，佛朗茲。我把這件事擱在心上四十年了，現在時間到了，我可以把這事情講出來了』。</p>
<p>『你的意思是說，我的太太欺騙了我？』這老軍官在盛怒之下呌着。</p>
<p>『你眞該死，佛朗茲』那哲學家說，面上現着一個凄凉柔軟的微笑。</p>
<p>佛朗茲嘴裏嘰咕了一陣，把他的烟斗點着。</p>
<p>這哲學家繼續着說：「你想的不對，她是眞正同安琪兒一樣純潔。你與我才是罪犯。你聽我講，這是四十三年以前的故事。那時你剛奉了命令到柏林來當上尉，我正在大學敎書。你知道，那時你是一個多麽粗野荒唐的人。」</p>
<p>「哦，」佛朗茲說。他舉起抖動的手捲着他的髭鬚。</p>
<p>「那時有個漂亮的女戲子，</p>
<p>「是的，正是時候了，」另外那一位說。他的聲調相當燥，好像軍官發令時粗糙的聲音。</p>
<p>那客人繼續說道「我從沒有想到，沒有了她，就會這樣的凄凉」。着。主人點頭，嘴裏咀嚼</p>
<p>『她給我們調製元旦甜酒，一共四十四次」。</p>
<p>那軍官插着說道，『你說得是］自從我們住在柏林，而你跟我們來往以後』。</p>
<p>客人繼續說道。「去年這時候，我們三個還是在一起，非常快樂的。她坐在那邊的安樂椅上替保羅的大孩子織短襪，拚命的趕。她說這襪子須在十二點鐘完成。後來就在十二點鐘完成了。於是我們喝甜酒，並且很舒服的討論死的問題。兩個月後，她眞的到了墳塲裏去了。你知道，我曾寫過一本很存的書，關於觀念的永生不滅。那時，你簡直一看都不要看。自從你太太死了以後，我也不要看了。老實說，什麽觀念不觀念，都不値得計較」。</p>
<p>那鰥夫說道：『是的，她是好婦人。她待我很好。每當我早上五點鐘出去辦公的時候，她已經起來了，並且總想法使我在出去之前能喝到一杯好咖啡。當然咯，她也有她的缺點。每當她同你高族哲理的時候－　喲」！大大的黑眼睛，細細的白牙齒，你還記得嗎？」</p>
<p>「我還記得！碧漾茄是她的名子。」這老人的飽經風霜的臉上還留着早年荒唐的痕跡。這時，臉上現着一個微弱的笑，但一下子又隱了。「她會咬人，我吿訴你，她是會咬八的！」</p>
<p>「那時你欺騙了你太太，你太太也猜到了。可是她從沒有講過什麽，只是暗自受苦。你沒有注意，我却注意到了。在我母親死了以後，她是我第一熟識的女子。她跑到我生命裏來，好像一個發着光亮的星星，我就仰望着，把她當作一個發着光亮的星星。最後我夜起了勇氣問她心上有什麽事。她笑着說，她覺得不很舒服。你還記得，這在保羅出生前不久。後來到了大除夕整整四十三年以前的那個晚上。那晚上八點鐘我到了你家裏，跟平常一樣。她正坐着刺繡；我們兩個正等着你回來，我讀書給她聽。時間就這樣過去了，過了一個鐘頭，又是一個鐘頭。你還不回來。我就看見她感覺非常不自然，她開始發抖了，我也發抖了。我知道什麽把你扣着不讓回來，我心裏很害怕，覺得你在那女人的懷抱中忘了十二點鐘了。那時已快近十二點鐘。她停了刺繍，我停了朗誦，來了一個可怕的靜默。我看見一顆眼淚從效的眼睛裏慢慢滾下來，掉在她的刺繡上。我就跳了起來，預備出去把你請回家來。我覺得我有能力把你從那女人旁邊拉回來。可是就在這時候你太太也跳了起來，就從我現在坐着的位子上跳了起來。</p>
<p>『「你要上那兒去？」她時着。在她面上表現着說不出的恐懼。</p>
<p>『「我要云找佛朗茲，」我說。</p>
<p>『她聽了這話，差不多要喊起來了。</p>
<p>「看天老爺的面，你不要走開，至少你（這字說得很重）可以跟我在一起。你（這字說得很重）不要離開我。」</p>
<p>『她於是向我身上一撲，把兩隻手擱在我肩上，把潮潤的臉藏在我的胸部。我整個的身體發抖了。從來沒有一個女子跟我這樣接近過。可是我還是支持着，我跟她講話，安慰她。她眞需要安慰。過了不久，你回來了，你沒有看出我慌張的樣子。你的臉上還是紅紅的，你的眼睛還表示出縱懲狂飲後的被倦。</p>
<p>「在那個大除夕，我心上起了變化，我非常害怕。自從我覺到她細軟的臂勝圍着我的頸子；自我嗅到她頭髮的香味以後，我覺得這發亮的星星已從天空中掉了下來，覺得這不是星星，而是一個女人，一個美麗而呼吸着情愛的女人。我自己知道我的眼睛裏燒着熱情；我齊備自己，駡自已是一個流氓，是一個騙子；我於是設法使你與你情婦分離，目的在取得良心上的安慰。運氣很好，我還有點兒錢，原是我祖上的遺產；我就把這筆錢給了她，她也滿意了，於是－」</p>
<p>『倒霉鬼，』老軍官插着說，「原來是你做的好事。碧漾茄寫給我一封動人的離別書，說她必須放棄我的愛情，可是她的心已在破碎了。』</p>
<p>「是的我做了這件事，該受你的埋怨，可是你聽我說，我給她錢，希望把這錢換取心上的平靜。但我估計錯誤了，狂妄的思想老在我腦子裏盤旋，愈來愈糟。我就埋頭做我的工作。我在那時候，我就得到了我那本「　念不滅論」的中心思想。但沒有用，心上還是沒有平靜。</p>
<p>『聲整的一年過去了，大除夕又來到了。我又坐在她的旁邊，就在這個坐位。那次你在家，在隔壁房間的沙發上睡着，因爲你在俱樂部裏攬得被倦了。度就坐在那裏，跟她靠得很近，望着她慘淡的面容，腦子裏想起上年的大除夕，我不能自主了。心裏想，何妨再把她的頭跟我親一下，再同她吻一下，要出什麽事，管它的！兩個人的眼光碟在一起。她的眼睛裏似乎流露着一個秘密的了解。我再不能控制自己了。我在她脚跟前倒了下來，把我的臉貼着她的膝蓋。</p>
<p>『我就這樣伏在那裏，動也不動，差不多有兩秒鐘之久。然後我覺得她冷冷的手按着我的頭，又聽到她輕輕軟軟的說；</p>
<p>『「你一定要好好的做人。」</p>
<p>「是的，我一定要好好的做人。隔壁房間裏睡着的人對我這樣信任，我當然不能欺負他的。我就跳了起來，四面望了一望，心裏非常難過。她就從桌子上拿了一本書遞給我。我懂她的意思，就把書隨便翻開朗誦。我不知道讀了些什麽。一個個字母在我眼前跳舞。可是漸漸的，心上的風浪平下來了。在十二點鐘的時候，你跑了過來，眼睛裏還有睡意，你說恭賀新禧。那時，我就覺得，我的罪過已經過云了，已經跑得很遠，在很遠的過去了。</p>
<p>『從那時起，我變得更平靜。我知道，她對我並無愛情，我除了希望她同情以外，並無其他企圖，一年一年渦去了。你的孩子舞長大成家。我們三個人都老了。你也停止了荒唐，爲了一個女人而生活着，跟我一樣。我沒有停止愛她。沒有，停止愛她是不可能的。可是我的愛變了方式。我這愛擺脫了世俗的願望，而轉向精神上的協調。你聽到我們談論哲理，總是要笑。可是你如果知道我們的靈魂如何熔合在一起，你一定會非常妬忌。現在呢，她已經死了。也許在明年大除夕，我們也得跟着她走了。因此，我必須趁這時候把我的秘密講出來，並且我要向你說：「佛朗茲，有一次我對不住你。求你饒恕！」』</p>
<p>他伸出他的手，墾求的對着他的朋友，可是佛朗茲賭氣的說：</p>
<p>『罷了，罷了，這些無聊！要饒恕的才多呢！你這段新聞，你的懺悔，太陳腐了。這些東西我已知道多少年了。四十年前她親自把這情形向我說過。現在我要吿訴你，爲什麼在我變成老頭兒以前，老是要追求女人——因爲，當她吿訴我這段故事的時候，她說：只有你才是她平生愛過的。』</p>
<p>在靜默中，他的客人向他瞪着。墻上的幾擦的一下，又敲着</p>

<h3>阿狄卡青年紀念像</h3>
<p>— 劉獅</p>
<p>每四年在塞維斯神前舉行一次的盛大的奧林比亞運動競技，當時的最優勝者大抵是屬於派羅蓬納索的靑年。阿狄卡靑年之抬頭，還是紀元前六世紀的事。凡連續三次優勝者，就可獲得這樣一個紀念像。於是一般彫刻家也有了涉足運動會的興趣與必要；希臘偉大的彫刻事業亦因之而得到長足的進步。</p>
<p>此爲雅典阿克洛波里美術館所藏者，原名「金髮之首」。其實應稱爲「阿狄卡靑年」，始符歷史。大理石彫，高C，二二米，約於紀元前四八〇年所作，一八八七年出土。　巧純熟，輪廓淸晰，表情嚴肅，可稱純粹希臘人的典型。</p>

<h3>女子書畫展一暼記</h3>
<p>— 施翀鵬</p>
<p>上海書畫團體，歷史悠久，組織充實者，除中國書會外，當推中國女子書畫會。該會每年有書書展覽會之舉行。本屆畫展，已於五月二日起，在成都路中國畫苑開幕，余偶與同鄕陳幹青暢論當代書車，乃乘興赴該會參觀。</p>
<p>全部作品都三百餘件，上海著名女畫家，除我同門　壽芝，孫孟錄及屠格屠時姊妹未有作品參加外，如唐冠玉，張紅薇，黄卓羣，李秋君，吳青霞，顧靑瑤，吳曼靑，陳小翠，鮑亞暉，周練霞，榮君立，金秋生，雷佩芝，朱爾貞，貝聿昭，等數十人，均有傑作陳列，山水人物，花卉翎毛，績紛滿月，各擅勝長，茲據記憶所及，略抒管見。</p>
<p>唐冠王女士爲當代大家馮超然高足，有墨筆山水，及花鳥各一幀，前者仿王黄鶴，後者師呂紀，邊艾進，神韵秀逸，書卷盎然。黄車羣女士工筆花卉，頗得力師紅薇老人秘奧，有出藍之譽。秋君墨筆山水一幀，渾厚國實，殊見工力之深。靑霞蘆雁四幀，使人有棄葭秋水之思，自是個中老手。顧靑瑤家學淵源，此次出品獨多，均極精粹，惟小幅較其大幅爲妙。吳曼靑前比夫婦畫展，頗得好評，此次仿石　山水大幅，墨氣淸新，筆意亦蒼勁動人。鮑亞軍爲我　斃少雲高足，陸廉夫再傳弟子，雲山縹渺，已能登堂入室。小翠練震之仕女，僥有明人唐仇風韵。金秋生爲秋君女史高足，深思，力學，頗有進境，人物山水一幀，俊秀飄逸，在吳小　陳老孫之間。佩芝爲郞靜山夫人，　孔子像大幅，有　石氣息，朱爾貞花卉頗秀麗，袁　淑書法極渾厚，皆傑搆也。</p>
<p>貝車昭初師午昌，後學湖　，松雲飛瀑一幀，幾可亂湖風之眞。龐左玉花卉，用筆設色，勁秀　　，亦爲此次畫展中壓卷之作。陳思董山水，樹法石法，彷彿吾師蕭屋泉筆意，其他　名　，吳佩佩，郁墓涇雲，慕貞，慕娟花卉，雙鈎設色，大有元人，意味開皆大千女弟子。余走馬一　，遺　殊多，凡所論列，幹靑謂所見略同云。</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>當汽車在馬路上疾駛的時候，海同戟指着路旁的霓虹燈，慨傷地說；</p>
<p>「那紅的是勞苦的人民底血，那自的是汗。」</p>
<p>「不，那綠顏色的才是汗。」我說。刹那間的沉默。</p>
<p>顯然的，我的這位老弟已經明白了我的意思。</p>
<p>因爲我從錄色想　在廣表的綠原上辛勞的耕耘。我又想到一張張被反映成慘綠色的面孔。</p>
<p>「都市愈繁榮，農村愈貧苦，這都市中有多少人們是替廣大的人羣貢獻過什麼呢？而都市龐大的書築物是要靠多少個農村來維持呢？」</p>
<p>我愛海同的不同流俗，然而這僅只是他天眞的囈語。於是我說；</p>
<p>「在理論上，你的話是不能成立的。因爲你只是就直覺指出了當前的一個表面的現象而已。</p>
<p>「你要知道人之將死，在一個很短的時間內，臉上會特別好看；，謂之「迴光返照」，然而這並不是健康的色澤。</p>
<p>說到這裏，我再也不忍心以我的傷感，輸人體　多思的好兄弟了。我却願意記錄下這段話，請親愛的讀者朋友們想一想！人病了，我們是找醫生呢？還是省下些法幣乾脆去買一口漂亮的「棺材」呢？（我懷疑古人寫「棺材」二字，不知是否有木旁？）</p>
<p>兩三年前，祖光吿訴我，他要寫一個戲，題名「捉鬼傳」。（按此劇已在上海上演，惜筆者以事忙朱觀。）然後他談起那劇情。最後的一段，迄今想來甚耐尋味，他說：</p>
<p>鍾進士爲五鬼灌醉，即昏然睡去，醒時已是二十世紀。鐘進十捉鬼的工具和手段因跟不上時代，遂爲羣鬼所毆，所以變成了現在的世界。」</p>
<p>這結尾（不知此劇後來是否因種種顧慮，而有所改動？）是充滿了現實之意味。喜劇之妙，在於笑裏有哭。</p>

<h3>何謂「禁觸主義」？</h3>
<p>— 謙</p>
<p>甘地一向認爲是印度敎一大汚點的「禁觸主義」（Uhtouckability，直譯爲不可接觸風俗），已經印度制憲會議最近通過加以取締了。關心印度的興盛和自由獨立的我們，聽到了印度人民吹起社會改革的號角，怎能不欣慰萬分。</p>
<p>我們　道，印度的社會複雜奇異，社會階級的界限森嚴，階級不同的人民從不婚嫁或交際，除了我們所熟知的僧侶，貴族，農工，奴隸四種階級的區分外，還有以職業爲區分的各種不同的階級，細說起來，竟有兩三千種之多。</p>
<p>這些人爲的階級的區分，使得印度社會分裂得屬害。而且，一切人爲的不平等阻碍了印度的發展和進步。</p>
<p>最慘的一個階級就是「不可接觸階級」(Untoucnables），所謂禁觸主義就是一般人對付不可接觸階級的人的態度，照其他階級的人看來，不可接觸階級的人的生性是卑汚的，上等人不但決不可與他們接觸，而且他們的影子也不可接觸，至甚連他們的形跡不可看見，以免沾汚上等人的眼睛。</p>
<p>於是，印度的四千多萬個屬于「不可接觸階級」的人，就受到了禁觸主養的絕對的歧視，他們被限定在特別的區域居住，不能參與上等人一切的活動，有許多公共的道路也不能走，在路上看見上等人就要躱避，總之，他們所過的是非人的生活，比牛馬不如的生活。</p>
<p>顯然的，印度如果要想復興，就必須打破社會階級的區分，禁觸主義的取締，更是當務之急。現在，我們行將見到佔印度人口七分之一的人民，因爲禁觸主義的的取締而獲得了基本人權的保障，我們眞要爲印度的前途額手稱慶。</p>

<h3>鬥魚</h3>
<p>— 白告</p>
<p>泰國的鬥魚(Betla　Pugnax）生性好鬥，常常準備着和同類的雄性相殺。這種魚養在水族館中需把他們隔開，不使聚在一起。泰國的鬥魚爲一種渺小的淸水魚，類乎中國的樂園魚Paradlgefish)，長僅及人的手指，可是它們戰鬥的劇烈着實驚人，頗能引起泰國人的興味和睹博，有一時期，泰國人竟有因鬥魚賭博，而傾家蕩　者，還有不惜自己的自由爲孤注，以喪失其自由爲賭注者。</p>
<p>所以優秀的鬥魚非常名貴，</p>
<h3>談諧音拆字格</h3>
<p>— 朝陽</p>
<p>中國文字，大都　象形會意，而諧聲一格，往往有出人意表者。諧談或述故事，用之尙易，而出之對偶，則比較難於運用，昨友人述一　聯云：「童子打桐子，桐子不落，童子不樂，麻姑吃蔴姑，蔴姑眞鮮，麻姑眞仙」。吾以爲此白話體也。若用文言體，再嵌古人名，則尤爲匠心獨運，眞天吳紫鳳，滅盡盡針線迹矣。如雙艇同開，櫓速（魯肅）不如帆快，（樊噲）八音迭奏，笛淸（狄靑）難比蕭和（蕭何）一聯，可謂文章本天成，妙手偶得之。此如拆字格之凍雨洒窗、東兩點，西三點，切糕分客，上七刀，下八刀，隨手拈來，都成妙締。文人心思，誠如水銀瀉地，無孔不入。或者會聖造字之時，即預留此種分配，以試擇聯者之技巧乎？飼養極審愼。雄性鬥魚常飼以蚊蛹，它對於魚的滋養和麥相似。這種魚對於它的子孫極善撫育，在它們的巢的上面，罩着一層用它們自己的唾液製成的屛障，嚴密保衛。</p>
<p>在泰國通行的門魚方式有兩種。第一是一種精細的審美主離的方式，兩尾魚置在兩隻隔離的玻璃箱中，兩箱並置，使它們可以隔玻互見，魚體顏色通常是黄灰色，兩箱並置後，突然漸起變化，到了它們發見敵蹤時，　漸張開，顏色由黄灰和棕色變深，成爲　麗的紫色，全身均呈鮮明的色彩。然後觸　怒張，如同張帆，認膜膨脹，色如血紅。它們互相向敵進攻，祇因撞着玻璃隔壁而止，這是門色，以色彩最美者爲勝。</p>
<p>如果兩尾魚置在同一箱內，就不以色彩決勝負，而以鋒銳的齒判勝負。需要拼一個你死我活，方始罷休。它們開始遭遇時，全體是艷麗的色彩，互相盤旋追逐，然後突然互衝，以致　片碎裂口齒咬壞，眼珠拉出眼巢。最先沉到箱底者爲負；負者體上兩側露出兩長條顯著的黑痕，頗似誌痛的哀思。但是勝者往往不容戰敗者苟延殘喘，仍繼續追逐，終至兩敗俱傷。</p>
<p>泰國的公衆鬥魚院營業已久，進行這種事業者需執有照會，發給照會的特權屬於國王私人，大的至少已有一百餘年的歷史了</p>
<h3>藝文壇</h3>
<p>國立上海音專於本月一（星期四）日下午七時半，在市中心該校大禮堂舉行第四次學生演奏會，節目甚多，共計聲樂器樂節目十九個，包括結樂三重奏，小提琴獨奏，大提琴獨奏，鋼琴獨奏；及男女高音獨唱，男低音獨唱與混聲四重唱等。演奏成績，頗爲良好，並有少數學生之作品（小提琴獨奏吳及絃樂曲各一）參加　　。</p>

<h3>「關門讀書」</h3>
<p>— 小隱</p>
<p>大概由於民主潮流的激　，年來學生運動似乎也顯得更形活躍，這現象是很可喜的。不過也有人不贊成，據說是學生的責任是讀書，讀書之外的事，殊可不必過問云云。</p>
<p>說這些話的人，他的頭腦無疑是很「冬烘」氣的。把學生關在學校要，讓他們捧着書本儘管死唸「之乎者也」或「ABDD」的時代，早已過去；在這裏，我不想抬出「讀書不忘建國」的那塊冠冕堂皇的大招牌來，但是，讓熱倩的靑年人，忍不住起來吶喊幾聲，也着實未可厚非吧？</p>
<p>明儒學案中有云：「顧盡成字季時，別號經凡，兄則涇陽先生也。一日喟然而嘆。涇陽曰：「何嘆也？」曰：「吾嘆夫今之講學者，恁是天崩地陷，他也不管，只顧講學耳！」……涇腸爲之慨然。」</p>
<p>這兩位老夫子生在幾百年前的明代，尙有如此見識，如果到了文明日益進步的現代，還來主張「關門讀書」，豈不被古人齒冷？</p>
<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>可是下午他就會到了太大愈和太不明瞭中國一般衙門　氣的苦味。第一科是我到了，余科長也出來見他了；可是人家辦公　要講手續！</p>
<p>「對不起，祝先生，這肅不行！」待老祝興高采烈地說明了來意，以及自己平上和熊處長接洽經過以後，那位暮氣沉沉的科長老爺才打着滿口廣西官話，冷冷地說：「熊處長沒有批下來，我們不接頭！」</p>
<p>「他難道沒有跟你提過　？」</p>
<p>「提過也沒有用！」余科長還是搖頭「我們辦公事總得見了公事再辦！」</p>
<p>老祝知道跟他爭也沒有用，便重復回到處長室去，再找熊處長；可是熊處長　不能那麽閑，兩點三刻尙未駕到，三點半終於來了，可是那麼多的客人，那麽多的電話，那麽多的所謂「公事」，已在他四周打起了銅牆鐵壁，使老祝再也衝不到他近身去。最後，居然見到了，可是忙了半天的熊處長，已把這件事忘記了大半；老祝又得跟他先客氣，後瞪眼睛，再發牢騷，像演戲似的再來一套，然後才蒙那位大處長提起筆桿，在老祝所帶的那封介紹信上批了幾句似通非通的話，算是給一科余科長的批　。</p>
<p>老祝捧着這一封寳貝信直跳列第一科。</p>
<p>「你們一起走幾位？」老公事的余科長把信看了四五遍，忽然又提出這一個問題來。（六四）</p>

The Communist 5th and 10th Columns, and Liu Bocheng's 7th Column, totaling over 30,000 men, are currently scattered and fleeing within Lu Xi. They are like birds startled by the twang of a bow and should not be difficult to completely encircle and annihilate. On the Jinpu front, the National Army had already crossed north of Dawenkou, north of Nanliu, and was rapidly approaching Tai'an on the 4th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 5th] After the main force of the Lu Communist Army retreated west of the Jinpu Railway back to the Yimeng Mountain area, they concentrated the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 9th, and 7th Columns, five columns in total, and gathered in the mountainous areas on both sides of the Mengyin-Qingtousi highway. The 1st and 3rd Columns were stationed north and south of Xintai, the 5th Column was stationed in Laiwu, the 10th Column was stationed in Zhangqiu and Mingxian, and the 6th Column was stationed in the mountainous area between Xintai and Sishui. Currently, Tai'an, Pingyin, Bacheng, Dong'a, and other places are all defended by local militia. The National Army is not concerned with the gain or loss of a single city or place but is concentrating its main force in the Yimeng Mountain area. Therefore, the truly decisive battles are now just beginning.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 5th] The National Army advancing toward the Culaishan area has already eliminated most of the Communist forces. The remnants of the Communist forces have collapsed and fled to Laihua, and the National Army is pursuing and sweeping up the area.</p>

<h3>Jinnan Ferry Crossing Contention Concludes; War Draws Closer to Taiyuan; Communist Remnants in Northern Shaanxi Can Be Eliminated Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping, 5th] The battle for the Jinnan ferry crossings has come to an end with the fall of Maojindu. A major battle with Taiyuan as its core is about to begin. It is reported that because the National Army defending Maojindu in Jinnan fought with their backs to the river and were greatly outnumbered, they have reportedly automatically withdrawn to the south bank of the Yellow River. Thus, all Yellow River ferry crossings from southwestern Shanxi to southern Shanxi have fallen into the hands of the Communist forces.

<h3>Sun Liren Discusses the War Situation; Emphasis on Shanxi Province Battles</h3>
<p>[United Press Beiping, 5th] The newly appointed Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security Command, Sun Liren, flew to Nanjing today. He reportedly told reporters that the death of Communist General Lin Biao in Harbin has been confirmed. He also said that the National Army has no plans to attack Harbin.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Beiping, 5th] General Sun Liren, the former commander of the New First Army, went to Nanjing today to report on his duties. Before leaving, he gave a speech stating that the Northeast Security Command has not received orders to occupy Harbin and that all military plans are currently being drafted by the central government. Important battles in various regions are being conducted based on special orders from the central government. The current war situation in the Northeast, except for Tonghua near the Korean border, is generally calm. He believes that the death of Lin Biao, the commander-in-chief of the Communist forces in the Northeast, has been confirmed and that he has now been succeeded by Lu Jingchao (transliteration). Of the battles on all fronts, the Communist offensive in Shanxi Province should be given "close attention." The strategy currently adopted by the Communist forces is similar to the situation when the Manchus entered the customs in the 17th century and established the Qing Dynasty. At that time, the Manchus first occupied Shanxi Province, then acquired Shandong Province, which completely isolated Hebei Province.</p>
<h3>Communist Forces Fleeing Northern Anhui Surrounded</h3>

In addition to instilling Communist ideology, they also trained them in espionage and other techniques, and falsely claimed through talismans and magic that they could be invulnerable to swords and guns, causing ignorant children to sacrifice themselves for them. The 320 who recently completed training have been dispatched to various recovered areas to carry out espionage and other work.

In his last broadcast, Chen made the following parting remarks: First: Taiwan is a territory of the Republic of China, with a mild climate and abundant products, and is an important military strategic base in the Pacific. At this time of turbulent international situation, it is inevitable that some ambitious elements will harbor covetous intentions and attempt to interfere. I hope all compatriots in the province will raise their vigilance, be cautious and fearful, and not be deceived or fooled by anyone. Any conspiracy to slander must be resolutely rejected. Second, I hope that all compatriots in the province will intensify their study of the national language and literature, understand the excellent culture of the motherland, and ensure that Taiwanese compatriots return to the original identity of citizens of the Republic of China. Third, Taiwanese compatriots have been under the harsh laws and severe punishments of the Japanese for the past 50 years, trembling with fear of violating the law. Therefore, many have a spirit of abiding by the law. However, this kind of law-abiding spirit is false and forced. Now the whole country is about to enter a new stage of democratic constitutionalism. I sincerely hope that Taiwanese compatriots will develop a spirit of abiding by the law spontaneously from now on. Fourth, Taiwan has been exploited by Japan for many years. On the surface, urban construction is still good, but in essence, rural life is extremely difficult. Since the recovery, we have tried to manage it in many ways. Most factories have started work, and farmers have also been able to cultivate to the best of their ability. The province has also been fortunate to avoid famine and has now passed the most difficult stage. I hope that all compatriots in the province will continue to work hard under the leadership of Chairman Wei, assist the government, and quickly complete the restoration work. Chen concluded by saying: "I came to Taiwan in October the year before last and it has been exactly a year and a half since then. I understand your advantages and weaknesses. Now that I am about to leave, I have specially stated the above parting remarks."</p>

<h3>Northeast Communist Forces Divided into Two Factions; Surface Friction Between the Two Sides Becomes Apparent</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Changchun, 5th] The cadres of the Northeast Communist forces can be roughly divided into two factions: one is the cadres who went to Yan'an, who are mostly domineering and act arbitrarily when things happen; the other is the original local cadres, whose composition is complicated and who do not have a deep understanding of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, the Yan'an cadres do not trust them, leading to mutual distrust. In recent days, this has become increasingly apparent.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Huayuankou Dam Restoration Project</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Huayuankou dam restoration project on the Yellow River, after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, was undertaken by the former Water Conservancy Commission, bringing together Chinese engineering experts with rich experience and engineers and experts from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in China. It commenced between the autumn and winter of the 34th year [1945] and took nearly two years to complete. This arduous project has now been completed. The amount of materials used was enormous. According to preliminary estimates, it consumed a total of 120 million market catties of willow branches, 60 million market catties of sorghum stalks, 2.6 million market catties of rope, 800,000 cubic meters of soil, and 150,000 cubic meters of stone. The space occupied by the accumulation of these materials is considerable. Taking the willow branches and sorghum stalks alone, used to pave a road three feet high and six feet wide, it could stretch from Nanjing to Shanghai. The rope required would be enough to make a large, thick rope the size of a walnut, encircling the entire city of Nanjing 130 times. In addition, the consumption of stone and soil was also astonishing.</p>
<p>After the breach, the Yellow River was not dammed for several years and was allowed to change course several times, causing the Yellow River water to flow into the Huai River basin in large volumes. The lower reaches of the Huai River, passing through Xuzhou, had been seized by the Yellow River and silted up five years ago, blocking the outflow of the Huai River water. The low-lying areas of Anhui and Jiangsu were bound to suffer disasters every year, and the area of low-lying lakes and marshes increased year by year, while the bottom of the lakes rose every year. If repairs were delayed any longer, the Yellow River would not only swallow up the fertile land of Anhui and Jiangsu but would also threaten to flow into the Yangtze River through the Grand Canal. The entire water system of east-central China would be disrupted. Moreover, the Yellow River had been flooding in this area for seven or eight years, and it never broke through a waterway. It was only with the completion of the damming project today that the Yellow River water was guided back into its old course.</p>
<p>Construction Plan: The process of damming the breach was extremely arduous. There were repeated failures and dangers, but it was finally completed through the efforts of all the engineering personnel. Huayuankou was completely seized by the river, and the riverbed at the breach had silted up eight feet higher than before after eight years of sedimentation. The riverbed upstream of the breach had been scoured seven feet deeper. In winter and spring, the water level was already nine feet lower than the riverbed of the old course. When damming the breach, it was necessary to raise the water level by twelve feet in order to make the entire river flow back into its old course. Also, the soil at Huayuankou is extremely fine sand, which cannot withstand rapid currents. Therefore, the damming plan was not as simple as generally damming a breach. After research and design by experts, it was decided to use the method of a riprap platform. The western 337 zhang (a Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.33 meters) of the shallow beach of the 487 zhang wide Huayuankou breach was to be filled in using the method of layered encirclement. For the eastern part, where the water depth was three to fifteen feet (150 zhang), a stone bridge was to be built. Steel rails were laid on top, and large pieces of stone were thrown down under the bridge to form a stone dam, blocking the river and forcing it to return to its old course. Because the soil of the Yellow River is fine sand, a mat of woven willow branches was first laid under the bridge and downstream of the bridge site before the stones were thrown, so that they would not sink deeply into the mud and the riverbed downstream would not be scoured into a deep pit by the turbulent water. When the stone dam was thrown to a considerable height, the water level upstream would naturally rise. If the water flow over the top of the dam was too rapid, stone wrapped in willow branches would be bundled into large pillows two to three zhang long and thrown down, adding layer upon layer until the water returned to its old course. However, the stone dam made of stones and willow branches could still allow water to seep through. Sorghum stalks had to be bundled and inlaid on one side of the dam downstream, and then soil was filled between the stone dam and the side dam to seal it. A large dam was then erected behind the stone dam, making the stone dam a permanent revetment for the dike.</p>
<p>Construction Process: After the plan was decided, several model tests were conducted at the Chongqing Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory, and a large-scale field test was conducted in Changshou County, Sichuan. Then, in the autumn and winter of the 34th year [1945], preliminary work such as surveying and mapping was carried out first. The damming personnel and basic workers arrived at Huayuankou in January of the 35th year [1946], and construction officially began on March 1st. Later, due to various obstructions by the Chinese Communists, it was decided to divide the responsibilities for management after consultation. The same year, work began on all fronts. UNRRA also sent engineering consultant Todd, leading a dozen staff members, bringing a large amount of equipment to participate in the work. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) sent a working team to the construction site to distribute flour and handle sanitation matters. The Henan Provincial Government formed a recruitment and material procurement committee to recruit laborers and purchase reeds, willow branches, and toon wood. The Zhangde-Boye Section Engineering Office of the Ministry of Communications built a railway from Guangwu Station on the Pinghan Railway to Huayuankou. The Ping-Han Railway used a large number of trains to transport equipment and food. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission organized a damming and dike restoration engineering bureau to take charge of the construction. Under this concerted effort, the project proceeded very rapidly. There was a slight pause when the Chinese Communists requested a delay in damming. In the deep-water part, because the riverbed was very flat, the deepest point was only fifteen feet. The bridge construction work proceeded relatively smoothly. The 150-zhang-long bridge was completed on June 21st. Later, due to insufficient stone transport, the water rose on June 20th, and some bridges were washed away, making the project more difficult. Moreover, the water level rose daily from June to September, and the average flow rate was over 6,000 cubic meters, making it impossible to carry out the project. Work resumed on October 5th. After several failures, starting in November, willow branches wrapped in stone pillows were used instead. By December 25th, the deepest section of the river channel in the eastern part of the breach had been filled. At the same time, the five parallel tracks on the bridge had also been laid. The damming and throwing of stones began immediately. On December 27th, the water level upstream rose to three feet and six inches, and water release began. From January 11th to 15th of the 36th year [1947], the water level rose sharply. The water level difference between the upstream and downstream of the stone dam was six feet. Rescue efforts were intensified day and night, but it was too late. Some stone dams were washed away. It was necessary to widen one side of the stone dam by three zhang with willow branches to prevent the water flow from scouring. The top of the dam was filled with layers of willow and stone to raise the riverbed by six feet so that the water flow could not pass over the top of the dam. Also, because the old course of the diversion river was too small, four additional diversion rivers were opened up in addition to the original two, so that most of the river water would return to the old course during the closing process, reducing the impact force. Also, in order to make the Yellow River leave the breach and head straight for the old course, two drainage dams were built west of the west dam head. These projects were all completed on March 27th.</p>
<p>The breach was called "Golden Gate," and there were strong backflows on both the upper and lower sides of the breach, called "Golden Gate Occupations," which had to be particularly strong. Willow pillows and large iron wire cages were used to construct them. The willow pillows were pushed down from opposite sides of the two Golden Gate Occupations, which was the closing. This section of the project was completed on March 15th.</p>
<p>Because there were too many stones downstream of the main dam, and there were multiple leaks in the base of the dam and the Golden Gate, it was necessary to carry out sealing work. For the sealing work, another parallel side dam was inlaid upstream of the main dam, about six zhang away from it. Soil was filled between the side dam and the main dam to fill the leaking gaps with soil. This project was completed on April 20th. At this point, the arduous project of damming the Huayuankou breach and restoring the dikes on the Yellow River was completed.</p>

<h3>Minister Gu Tells Reporters: Principle of Unfreezing the Index Determined, Report on Shanghai Consultations Submitted to the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] After returning to Nanjing on the 4th, Social Affairs Minister Gu reported the results of consultations with labor and management in Shanghai to Chairman Chiang and Executive Yuan President Zhang on the morning of the 5th. In the afternoon, he invited experts to discuss the issue of unfreezing the cost of living index. At 5:00 PM, he visited President Zhang again at the Executive Yuan to discuss this issue. Afterwards, reporters interviewed him, and he said: The issue of unfreezing the cost of living index has now been decided in principle. However, we are currently concerned about the impact of unfreezing, one being to stimulate prices and the other to stimulate foreign exchange. We are currently considering solutions and a decision can be made this month, and it will be discussed and decided by the Price Committee.</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] The Kuomintang Central Executive Committee today resolved to recommend to Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun to unfreeze the cost of living index, which is the first sign of a gradual easing of emergency economic measures. According to Kuomintang officials who spoke to United Press, the Central Executive Committee unanimously supported the early unfreezing of the cost of living index so that the new government could adjust the treatment of civil servants and soldiers. Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi attended the meeting today to report on the military situation and reiterated his belief that victory would ultimately be won in the war against the Communists, but he strongly advocated changing the treatment of American soldiers in order to boost morale. It is said that the current monthly salary of soldiers is only 20,000 yuan, which is not enough to buy six bowls of noodles at current prices.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] According to the Beiping cost of living index compiled by the Economics Department of Yenching University for late April, the total index for public school teachers and staff was 23,007 times, and the total index for workers' cost of living was 25,279 times.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Rice Riot Subsides, Wuxi Sees Another Robbery Spree, Over a Thousand Shi of White Rice Robbed in One Day</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 5th] The Hangzhou rice riot has subsided. Grain merchants have accepted the government's post-riot arrangements. The entire city will resume business on the 6th, and the government will allocate 3,000 shi of public grain as a relief for resuming business. The authorities will immediately investigate the losses of the rice shops that were destroyed. The curfew in the central district has been lifted since the evening of the 5th, and order has been restored.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 5th] At the Provincial Government's Memorial Week today, Deputy Director Wang of the Land and Food Department reported on the handling of the Hangzhou rice riot, saying that there were three reasons for the riot: (1) Grain prices in the production areas rose sharply in mid-March, but the assessed prices in the city were unwilling to follow, and the source ran out; (2) Grain prices in the areas surrounding Hangzhou rose sharply, and the city's limited prices were too low, resulting in a backflow phenomenon; (3) Grain merchants waited and watched, and citizens rushed to buy, resulting in supply not meeting demand and a sharp rise in the black market, leading to the destruction of rice shops. The source of the rationed grain includes 110,000 shi of civilian food rice purchased by the Bank of China on behalf of the government, 100,000 bags of grain allocated by the Department of Finance, and 10,000 shi of grain purchased, totaling 172,380 shi. The rationing method is: public school teachers and staff are allocated 8 dou per month, laborers 5 dou, and technicians 3 dou and 4 sheng, at a price of 117,000 yuan. Workers are allocated 2 dou and 4 sheng per month, at the same price. Impoverished households are allocated 2 sheng per day. Public school teachers and staff will start collecting grain today, impoverished households will be distributed within days, and workers are still waiting for the list to be cleared.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 5th] Recently, grain prices in the county have been skyrocketing, and the black market has reached 300,000 yuan per shi. At about 8:00 AM this morning, a rice robbery broke out in the Huinong Bridge area of Beizhakou. The heaviest losses were suffered by Zhang Baotai, followed by Chengtai, Xiangyuan, Yuanfeng, and other five companies, with a total of more than 1,000 shi of white rice robbed. No less than 1,000 people participated in the robbery. At about 10:00 AM, after the authorities ordered a large number of military police to the scene to suppress the riot, they dispersed. Four robbers, including Xun Yunfu, were arrested on the spot. All other rice shops were closed, and the situation was serious.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The rice robbery continued to occur this morning. More than 20 rice shops in the Huangni Jiang, Qingming Bridge, under the North Outer Bridge, and Tonghui Bridge areas of Nanmen were looted. Rice shop workers were also beaten.

<p>Shouxian: After a long period of clear weather and drought for nearly three months, a strong wind blew on April 30, and the spring rain was like oil, nourishing the farmland and growing wheat and barley. The farmers celebrated with joy.</p>
<p>Hefei: Shen Hongchang, Xinhefeng, and other companies in Dongwai Shangjie purchased more than 300 shi of brown rice and mixed paste on behalf of merchants.

<h3>Siam Announces Immigration Quotas: Chinese Nationals Limited to 10,000; Philippine Senate Decides to Postpone Discussion on Reducing Citizenship Quotas</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 4th] The new method of limiting immigrants to Siam (i.e., the quota system) has been officially announced and will be implemented from May 1st. Under this system, the number of foreign immigrants allowed into Siam is stipulated as follows: 10,000 for Chinese nationals and 200 for other nationalities. According to the announcement by the Siamese Ministry of Interior, these figures are only for the period from May 1st to the end of this year. The announcement did not specify whether the method will remain valid in subsequent years or will be subject to revision. According to the new system, foreigners entering Siam are divided into three categories: immigrants, non-immigrants, and non-quota immigrants. Under the following circumstances, foreigners entering Siam are considered non-immigrants: (1) those coming to Siam for business or travel, or for temporary reasons such as health; (2) those passing through Siam; (3) crew members temporarily berthed on ships in Siamese ports; (4) students. Non-quota immigrants include those working for the Siamese government in Siam, husbands of Siamese women, professors, religious workers, and those holding valid residency or re-entry permits issued by the Siamese authorities. Anyone not belonging to the above two categories and wishing to reside permanently in Siam will be regarded as an immigrant and will be treated as such. Non-immigrants entering Siam must pay 50 Siamese baht annually during their stay in Siam. Immigrants and non-quota immigrants pay an entry fee of 200 Siamese baht once upon entry at designated Siamese ports, and thereafter, they only need to renew their residence permits annually without further fees. There is no requirement for foreigners entering Siam to hold passports, as Siam has not yet established a consulate in China to issue passport visas; therefore, this method will at least temporarily apply to Chinese people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 5th] Regarding the proposal by Philippine Senator Saludo to reduce the quota for foreign entry from 500 to 50 annually, it is reported that the Senate has decided to postpone discussions during its session. The majority of Senate officials believe that discussions should be avoided while the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty is pending ratification, in order to demonstrate a spirit of goodwill towards China. At the same time, it is reported that the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee has also expressed opposition to Saludo's proposal.</p>
<h3>Saigon French Gendarmerie Suddenly Searches Central News Agency</h3>
<p>Protest Filed but No Response Received</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Saigon, 5th] Two French gendarmes, without any orders, suddenly came to the Central News Agency office here yesterday at midnight and searched various documents, and threatened with a pistol, detaining Kang Jihong, a reporter of the Central News Agency, for more than an hour. (Note that the French High Commissioner in China had previously announced freedom of the press in Vietnam.) The Central News Agency has filed a protest regarding this matter, but has received no response.</p>
<h3>Postal and Remittance Workers Association Petitions Regarding Layoffs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Postal and Remittance Workers Association is petitioning in Nanjing regarding the Postal and Remittance Bureau's large-scale dismissal of non-postal staff, leading to the closure of over 30 branch offices in various locations, but has received no results. The association held a reception for reporters on the 5th, requesting them to appeal on their behalf and persevere to the end. The bureau director's reasons for the layoffs are "overstaffing, requiring the dismissal of some personnel, and all non-postal staff should be subject to examination." Recently, over 40 representatives from branch associations in Hankou, Shantou, and other places arrived in Nanjing separately last month, held a national representative conference, and simultaneously appealed to various relevant agencies. They met with Bureau Director Gu five times, but the response received was still the same order could not be changed. On April 24th, it was rumored that the bureau would lay off another 61 people. After arguing with Bureau Director Gu on the basis of reason, they were granted a temporary postponement of the announcement, but he still firmly stated that some personnel must be laid off, and all non-postal staff will be uniformly renamed employees in the future and will not receive salary increases. All colleagues in the association expressed dissatisfaction and plan to visit Bureau Director Gu again to request the revocation of the original resolution.</p>
<h3>Zhen'an County Bloodshed Case in Shaanxi Province: County Magistrate Was the Real Culprit</h3>
<p>Provincial Assembly Resolves to Telegraph the Nation</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 5th] The truth about the Zhen'an County bloodshed case has not been fully disclosed by the authorities. One account states that the victims of the assassination included Li Pingzhi, the Speaker of the County Assembly, and his secretary, Wan Wuying. Six lives were lost in the case, all dying in Li's residence that night. According to Liu Nanhui, a Provincial Assembly member from the county, County Magistrate Sun Huobo personally led the team that killed them, because the County Assembly had repeatedly exposed the County Magistrate's misconduct, and Speaker Li Pingzhi refused to come forward to defend Sun Huobo in the case of luring a female teacher into illicit relations, incurring Sun's wrath. The Provincial Assembly has resolved to telegraph the entire nation and request the government to guarantee the safety of all members of the County Assembly. Liu Nanhui, the Provincial Assembly member in Xi'an, has been placed under the protection of special police officers since yesterday to prevent unforeseen events.</p>
<h3>Li Wanchun's Traitor Case: Hebei High Court Retries Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] After the case of famous actor Li Wanchun, accused of being a traitor, was sent back for retrial, the Hebei High Court held a public trial today. Li denied that his performance of the two plays "Ban Chao Joins the Army" and "Wu Song" on January 8, 1945, the anniversary of the puppet government in Nanjing joining the war, was intentional, but rather a coincidence. He also denied broadcasting "Down with Britain and America" during the intermission of the performance, claiming he was explaining the plot. The prosecutor argued that Li was stubbornly defending himself. Finally, Li called out "Have pity on me" to the court. The court announced that the verdict would be announced on the 8th.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce Annual Meeting: Business Leaders Besiege Price Controls; Public Opinion Resents and Rebukes as Impractical</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hong Kong, 5th] The difference of opinion between Hong Kong community leaders and the general public on major public issues can be demonstrated by the speeches at the annual meeting of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Gillespie of Butterfield &amp; Swire, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, expressed support for the direct tax system and criticized the Department of Supplies, Trade and Industry. Mr. Gillespie pointed out that the indirect tax system forces even those in poorer circumstances to bear the tax burden, while the direct tax system is fairer. He criticized various measures of the Department of Supplies, such as trade and price controls, especially the Department's requisition of cloth and distribution to the public last year. He also criticized importers and middlemen for obtaining excessive profits. In reviewing Hong Kong's trade, Mr. Gillespie said that although the number of imported ships has recently increased sharply, it is still far from the pre-war record. Regarding the wage issue, Mr. Gillespie believed that under the current high cost of living, although the capitalists sympathize with the situation of the laborers, they also have to consider the difficulty that high wages will make it impossible for Hong Kong's prices to maintain balance with world prices. He estimated that wages and costs in the industrial sector have risen about four to five times compared to pre-war levels. Mr. Gillespie also stated that opening up "capital" to foreign trade is indeed necessary, and this matter has attracted the attention of the British Foreign Office and the Ministry of Commerce. Another business leader, Mr. Hanson, followed with a speech expressing the hope to restore Hong Kong's free enterprise system. This opinion has aroused resentment among the general public, who believe that trade and price control policies are the main factors in stabilizing life. Therefore, newspapers have criticized the aforementioned speeches as impractical. In fact, although the measures of the Hong Kong government's Department of Supplies inevitably infringe on the interests of the so-called business giants, at least they are still appropriate in terms of their effectiveness.</p>

<h3>Special Article: Looking Forward to Future Public Health Undertakings</h3>
<p>— Yin Jiting</p>
<p>——Written for the Establishment of the Ministry of Health and the 7th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Medical Association</p>
<p>In the past six months, China's public health undertakings have undergone a major turning point. In early November last year, the Department of Health convened the National Public Health Administration Conference, which made important resolutions and measures regarding national public health administration. In May of this year, the government was reorganized, and the Department of Health was expanded into a ministry, indicating the authorities' emphasis on national health. On May 5th, the Chinese Medical Association convened its 7th annual meeting in the capital following the establishment of the Ministry of Health. The former oversees national public health administration, carrying out central laws and regulations and supervising and assisting local areas in promoting public health undertakings; the latter is the only academic organization in the domestic medical community, encompassing authoritative medical scholars in the country, who have made many contributions to the country in the past in terms of technology and administration. This is the first gathering after the victory, and at the time of the Department of Health's transformation into a ministry, it is bound to have more contributions and achievements. This is what we hope for and congratulate.</p>
<p>China's public health undertaking began with the establishment of the Ministry of Interior in the first year of the Republic of China. The President issued an order promulgating the official system of the Ministry of Interior, which established a Health Department within the Ministry of Interior to be in charge of public health administration, laying the foundation for China's public health undertaking. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, the National Government promulgated the outline of the national public health administration system. On November 1st of that year, the Ministry of Health was officially established, becoming the highest institution for public health administration. Unfortunately, it was short-lived, and the Ministry of Health was reduced to a Health Department, which was subsequently changed to an Office. During the Anti-Japanese War, this system was maintained, and it survived the great national crisis. Although affected by the Anti-Japanese War and limited by talent and economy, it was still able to adhere to the principle of sharing weal and woe and make achievements in difficult circumstances. Now that it has been expanded into a ministry, it should make new actions and new achievements compared to the past.</p>
<p>However, China is vast and populous, education is not widespread, people's livelihoods are based on agriculture, economic production is backward, sanitary facilities are rudimentary, and in addition to years of war, the losses are huge. Public health undertakings are in a state of disrepair. I would like to list my humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Resolutely Implement the Public Doctor System. The essence of the public doctor system is that the state should provide medical and health care and benefits to the people equally, regardless of poverty or wealth, or class. In other words, the government should socialize medical and health undertakings, transforming it from a system that resembles a transaction into a welfare facility of the state for the people. The state's possession of doctors is like the army and police. The army defends the country's territory and sovereignty, the police maintain social order, and doctors have the responsibility of protecting national health. Therefore, the essence of medicine is to apply benevolence to the art and save people from danger. China's rudimentary medical and health facilities and lack of talent are indeed the main reasons for the poor state of public health undertakings; however, given the abnormal state of Chinese society today, the private doctor system is prevalent, doctors gather in cities, open practices, and earn a living on their own, only seeking personal convenience and failing to coordinate with the needs of the entire nation. Moreover, the fees are high, preventing the general public from seeking medical care, which is a major obstacle to the popularization of medical care. The implementation of the public doctor system should be strictly managed, so that medical personnel are dispatched and conscripted, based on laws and regulations, and no different from the army. In implementing this system, it is especially important to increase the treatment of medical personnel and ensure occupational safety, so that they do not have to worry about life and can concentrate on their careers.</p>
<p>2.  Implement Planned Disease Prevention. Infectious diseases have been draining the national constitution of our country and harming economic production, as everyone knows. For several years, epidemics have been increasing rather than decreasing. Taking smallpox as an example, China invented vaccination to prevent smallpox at the earliest time. Today, it is still prevalent. New vaccination methods have only been around for more than a hundred years since Jenner's invention in 1796, and smallpox has almost disappeared in Western countries; while there are still many patients in our country. Smallpox immunization is 100% reliable; it is still difficult to eradicate, let alone diseases without absolute prevention. During the fall of Taiwan, infectious disease management was effective, and traditional Chinese medicine disappeared. With the victory, infectious diseases also recovered, and cholera attacked, causing many deaths, and traditional Chinese medicine became prevalent again. This fully proves the incompetence of China's public health practitioners. Why is it safe and sound in the hands of foreign nations, and the quality changes immediately after being taken back? The problem of trachoma is all over every corner of our country: During the war, an examination of Chongqing citizens showed that more than 80% suffered from trachoma, and at least one out of every three blind people was blinded by trachoma. How many people were blinded by trachoma and lost their sight. In addition, endemic diseases are a serious problem affecting the national health of our country: Kala-azar in North China, schistosomiasis in the Yangtze River basin, malaria in the southwest, etc., have been spreading for years, causing a high mortality rate. Other acute infectious diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, and diphtheria, the losses caused by the prevalence of rampant diseases are countless. Therefore, China's disease prevention undertaking is urgent and cannot be delayed. It is necessary to improve planning and investigation, and effectively prevent and control diseases according to the actual needs of disease prevalence. In addition to a sound disease prevention institution in the center, local disease prevention undertakings are close to the people, easy to understand the epidemic situation, and directly eliminate them, and should not be omitted. Central and local governments should work together to gradually eliminate infectious diseases.</p>
<p>3.  Develop Local Medical and Pharmaceutical Undertakings. Local areas are closely related to the people. Medical undertakings should be more developed. National facilities have not yet been popularized. Several provinces and regions have large areas, but there are no provincial hospitals established, and people's medical care is extremely difficult. Although there are only provincial hospital institutions, the area is too large and the population is too large, which is of no practical help. The facilities of provincial hospitals should be established in proportion to the population of the area. A relatively large-scale provincial hospital should be established in each administrative region of a province. As for the county health centers in our country, they are even rarer. Those that already exist are pitifully simple due to financial difficulties and lack of talent. In the future, funding should be increased, treatment should be improved, each county should have health center facilities, and branches should be established according to the area of the county. Local public health undertakings can not only provide medical treatment for people's diseases, but also carry out health education, instill health knowledge, break superstitions, reduce unnecessary waste, and also carry out disease prevention work. The relationship to the entire public health undertaking is very important.</p>
<p>4.  Implement Drug Management. Drugs are the main part of public health undertakings. China's industry is backward, and most new drugs rely on foreign imports, causing speculative drug dealers to raise prices arbitrarily; or shoddy products are created in various ways, making them difficult to identify. Not only are the poor unable to afford to buy them, but they often spend money without effect, and in severe cases, they may even get sick as a result. Therefore, it is necessary for the government to manage drugs and implement state-owned enterprises. Drugs should not be sold without a doctor's prescription. Health agencies can also sell drugs, but they must be limited to government-set prices and must not raise prices arbitrarily. In this way, the uncontrolled sale of drugs can be avoided, and the rich and the poor can get practical benefits.</p>
<p>There are many aspects of China's public health undertakings that need to be developed. The above are just the most urgent and important ones. At this time when medical professionals from all over the country are gathered together in the capital, we hope that the convening of this conference will have fruitful achievements and great gains. National health and the future of the country all depend on it?</p>

<h3>Five Communist Cabinet Members Forced to Resign: French Political Situation Enters New Stage; Prime Minister Ramadier Decides to Continue Governing; French People Must Strictly Observe Discipline to Overcome Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Paris Broadcast on the 5th: France begins its "greatest duel" against the Communists today. After dismissing five Communist ministers last night, Prime Minister Ramadier convened a joint cabinet meeting today, with the Communist Party also attending.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 4th] Ramadier's coalition cabinet, with a lifespan of only three months, expelled five Communist cabinet members from the cabinet last night. Prior to this, the parliament voted two to one to express confidence in the government's plan, and the Communist Party members voted against it. The five Communist officials who left office were Deputy Prime Minister Thorez, Minister of National Defense Billoux, Minister of Construction Dillion, Minister of Labor Croizat, and Minister of Public Health Marqui. Four of the ministers have been temporarily replaced by others. De Tay of the Popular Republican Movement is acting as Deputy Prime Minister, Tel Boss of the Left-Wing Union is acting as Minister of National Defense, Gauss De of the Popular Republican Movement is acting as Minister of Labor, and Moch of the Socialist Party is acting as Minister of Construction. After this partial reorganization of the Ramadier cabinet, it now includes members of the Socialist Party, Popular Republican Movement, Radical Socialist Party, and two non-party members. A cabinet spokesman said that Ramadier does not intend to submit a list of the reorganized cabinet for parliamentary approval, so the parliament will not reconvene before the regular meeting on the 6th. The next meeting will discuss the Madagascar riots.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 4th] The Socialist Party's relationship to this political storm is quite subtle. The parliament voted 360 to 186 in favor of Ramadier's wage freeze policy, with Communist Party members voting against it and 63 members abstaining. Afterwards, the Socialist Party cadres held a meeting to discuss countermeasures. The vote resulted in 12 to 9 in favor of Prime Minister Ramadier's cabinet resigning completely. Socialist leader Blum, who had long disagreed with the left-wing elements in the party, convened an emergency meeting of the party's members and delivered a passionate speech, strenuously advocating the exclusion of the Communist Party. The final vote was 56 to 9, overturning the party cadres' decision and advocating that Ramadier remain in office and asking the Communist Party members to withdraw from the cabinet. At that time, the situation was chaotic. Many cabinet members, including the Communist Party members, went to the Prime Minister's office tonight to prepare to attend the meeting, only to learn that the meeting had been postponed. Communist Party leader Du said in the parliament: Whether the Communist Party remains in the government or implements withdrawal, it still considers itself to be a party of the government. It means that it may still support the government outside the cabinet. The Socialist Party leader, seeing the direction of the wind, decided not to have the Communist Party and try to govern alone.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 4th] Political figures here predict that after the Communist Party withdraws from the government, it may plunge France into chaos and revolution, because the Communist Party can control the trade unions. After being in the opposition, it will inevitably cause labor unrest and paralyze France.</p>
<p>[French News Agency, Paris, 4th] France will encounter various difficulties in the next two months, mainly difficulties in food and currency. France must strictly observe discipline in order to overcome these difficulties. Changing prices and raising wages will destroy the currency system, and destroying the currency system is equivalent to destroying the working class. Another issue is the issue of the parliamentary system. The parliamentary system can be viewed in two aspects. First, there is a contract between the Prime Minister and the parliament, which all government officials should respect, otherwise there will be no parliamentary system to speak of; second, any cabinet member must be bound by the principle of cabinet unity.</p>
<h3>US Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan: House of Representatives Has Begun Final Debate; Decision Made Will Have Major Historical Significance</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] The US government's proposal to provide $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey, the House of Representatives launched the final debate today, it has a great relationship with the formation of history. Members of the House of Representatives will find an answer to a question, that is, will this case promote peace or will it cause war. Only time can give a definite answer to this question. However, the House of Representatives has encountered two paths as a result, one is to take action now to curb the spread of communism, and the other is to wait and see whether the United States and the Soviet Union can reconcile the differences in their lifestyles. Which way to go must be decided now. After 22 days of debate, the Senate has passed the bill by a vote of 67 to 23, deciding to take action now.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 4th] On the eve of the House of Representatives' discussion of the bill to aid Greece and Turkey in preventing communism, the government's foreign policy today encountered triple threats. The seriousness of this kind of domestic front challenging Secretary of State Marshall is only seen since the end of the war. The three threats are as follows: (1) Republicans in the House of Representatives have great differences of opinion on the $400 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey. It is now planned to suggest that this matter be submitted to the United Nations for handling, and a part of the Democrats are behind it. (2) The Senate has also disputed the government's proposed $350 million foreign relief plan. The House of Representatives has reduced the amount to $200 million. (3) The House of Representatives' Expenditure Committee is rumored to recommend canceling the funding for the State Department's propaganda and cultural departments, including the "Voice of America" radio station. Marshall is prepared to meet this challenge, and his method is to first restore propaganda funding, believing that propaganda is essential for gaining understanding of American foreign policy from foreign people. He has invited 21 congressional leaders, all major decision-makers in finance, diplomacy, and transportation, to hold an extraordinary meeting with radio industry leaders tomorrow. In order to comply with President Truman's and the bipartisan policy, members of both the Republican and Democratic parties have been invited to the meeting.</p>
<h3>English Translation of 申報 Newspaper Sections</h3>
<h3>English and American Newspaper Commentary - French Political Turmoil</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] Today's newspapers here have all published articles detailing the political turmoil in France. "The Times" emphasized that regardless of the outcome of negotiations by the country's leaders, France is likely to enter a new historical phase. It stated briefly: This French political turmoil is not merely a conflict, but will actually have a decisive impact on the future politics of France. Now, the coalition government seems to be in danger of decline. It is hoped that France can manage itself well, but in the current stalemate, the only one who can rise to the occasion is likely to be Charles de Gaulle. "The Daily Telegraph" was even more frank, believing that the division during yesterday's vote of confidence created a new opportunity for de Gaulle, and that France's urgent task today should be to unite the people and seek economic recovery in order to restore France's past international standing.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 4th] "The New York Times" stated in today's editorial that the French Communist Party's attempt to provoke a cabinet crisis to overthrow the current government proves that they not only want to demonstrate their power in France, but also throughout Western Europe. French Foreign Minister Bidault's previous expression in Moscow of a desire to align with Western countries angered the French Communist Party. Furthermore, the French Communist Party may also be alarmed by Truman's policies and the de Gaulle movement. In short, the overall situation in France is serious, and the Communist Party is the country's only major party.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Postpones Resignation - Parties Actively Preparing to Form a Coalition Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] Japanese Cabinet Secretary General Ryozo Hayashi recently told a Central News Agency reporter that the resignation date of the Yoshida Shigeru Cabinet, which has been in power for nearly a year, will be postponed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] The Socialist Party stated that party leader Tetsu Katayama will soon issue invitations to invite the leaders of the other three parties to convene a four-party meeting after the cabinet resigns.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 5th] The Japanese Cabinet is scheduled to meet tomorrow to draft an edict summoning the new parliament to convene on May 20th. Newspapers predict that the cabinet will also resign at that time.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] The general meeting of members of both houses of parliament belonging to the Socialist Party was held on the 4th. First, Chairman Katayama delivered a speech stating that since the Socialist Party now stands in the position of the largest party, it should bear the great responsibility of solving all national difficulties and national crises. Next, Secretary-General Nishio stated: Although the Socialist Party has not obtained a majority of seats in the parliament, if it gains the support of the people, it will not be difficult for our party to obtain the prime ministership and form a cabinet. In fact, those who advocate a coalition cabinet are not only the Liberal and Democratic parties, but also the working masses and business people. Our party should strive to form a coalition cabinet. Many people subsequently spoke on the political situation, and the results all agreed that Chairman Katayama should be the prime minister, and the policies should implement the Socialist Party's original policies.</p>
<h3>Reports of Soviet Military Exercises in the Bering Strait - The US Prepares for a Second Arctic Zone Maneuver</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, blank Day] British Broadcasting Corporation broadcasted news that the Soviet Army has held spring exercises on the northeastern coast of Siberia across the Bering Strait from Alaska. The number of army participants is 250,000. Later, the Soviet Pacific Fleet and the Mongolian People's Republic Army will also participate. According to Swiss anti-communist broadcasts, there is often news about Soviet movements, but it cannot be investigated elsewhere, so it may be inaccurate. Some people also express doubts about the number of people involved in the exercises, because it is difficult to maintain the actions and supplies of such a large number of people on the northeastern coast of Siberia. But based on the saying that the Mongolian army is also participating, the exercise location may be in the vast area of Siberia.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] The Army Department announced today that the United States will hold its second Arctic zone maneuver in Alaska starting on November 1st this year. Infantry and troop transport aircraft will participate. Army Air Force Commander Devers said that last winter's exercise convinced people that infantry should step up the use of air transport in the area. This announcement by the Army Department came after the Navy Department asked Congress to approve a shipbuilding plan, which stipulates the construction of submarines and ships, especially for use on the Arctic Sea.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhuchen's Concealment of Enemy Assets Case, Continued Hearing for Teng Yongxi, Summons and Interrogation of the Director of the Central Machinery Factory</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] In the case of Wang Zhuchen concealing assets of the enemy 長島洋行 , Teng Yongxi, the former deputy director of the Putuo Road Police Precinct, was indicted for allegedly concealing stolen goods on behalf of Wang. The District Court's Criminal Division reopened the trial yesterday and summoned Fan Rongchun, Director of the Central Machinery Factory, as well as employees Gu Dingyi, Zhou Lanlan, and Liu Zhonglian, and Wang Zhuchen to testify. According to the testimony, he had a teacher-student relationship with Wang's brother-in-law, Yu Qingjian. Yu claimed that he had bid for automobile materials in Hongkou and asked for help in storing them, so he introduced them to the Central Machinery Factory on Jiangning Road for storage. He stated that Jiangning Road was not under his jurisdiction and that it was entirely a private favor to Fan, not an abuse of power. Furthermore, he continuously sent letters to Fan after the incident, stating that if the stored items were indeed enemy assets, he would not evade responsibility. He also stated that the case had been delayed for four months and requested a speedy conclusion. Witnesses Fan and Gu still stated that they only discovered the situation after seeing it reported in the newspapers and reported it to the authorities. Their testimonies were largely the same as in the previous two court sessions. The court considered the presence or absence of the words "長島洋行" on the wooden boxes storing automobile materials to be crucial evidence and ordered the bailiffs to accompany Fan and Gu to investigate on the spot. The case will be scheduled for another trial at a later date.</p>
<h3>Customs Police Chief Embezzlement of Fines Case; Defendant Claims Negligence in Duties</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] The case of Fang, the acting police chief of the Jianghai Customs, embezzling fines and engaging in corruption was publicly tried for the first time yesterday by Judge Meng Tingke of the Criminal Division of the District Court. Li Duote, the Inspector General of Customs, attended and listened in. According to the defendant Fang Junde, on June 21st of last year, the Huangzaoji Shipyard was fined 2 million yuan for obstructing the waterway while salvaging a sunken ship in the Huangpu River. The funds were placed in a silver box, but due to being busy with other matters, they were not handed over. He stated that this was negligence in his duties, not corruption. The court also inquired as to why eight of the fine receipts had been torn up. Fang could not answer but claimed to have found four of them. Huang Jiangren (manager of Huangzaoji), the witness, stated that the fine was paid to the officer on duty based on Fang Junzhi's note and that a receipt was obtained. He knew nothing else. Wei Benshuo, the deputy commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, stated that the police chief had no power to impose fines; only the harbor master could impose fines on violations, so Fang's actions were illegal profiteering. The court determined that the case still required further investigation of evidence and scheduled another hearing for May 14.</p>

<h3>The Bizarre "Wu Xun" Planning to Come to Shanghai to Solicit Donations; Garrison Headquarters Orders Subordinates to Investigate and Prohibit</h3>
<p>A man named Zhang Shihuang, who calls himself "Modern Wu Xun," came east from Chongqing last year, using the pretext of preparing for the "Thousand Buddha University" to issue declarations and solicit donations everywhere. Many people were fooled by him. His business card lists the following titles: "Doctor of Social University, Political Beggar of the Wartime Capital, President of the China Independent Drama Society, King of Beggars of China, President of Jinan Thousand Buddha University, Commander of the Iron-Blooded Anti-Traitor Nation-Building Salvation Army, Director of the Chongqing Poor Children's Education Institute, Manager of Revolutionary Wall Newspaper." In March of this year, Zhang arrived in Shanghai from Beijing and opened a room at No. 432 of the Zhongnan Hotel, still using his old tricks to solicit donations from all sides. The Garrison Headquarters, considering Zhang's words and deeds to be bizarre, requested the Municipal Education Bureau to investigate and prohibit them. Zhang then left Shanghai for Beijing and sent a letter to the Education Bureau on March 28, stating, "I cannot survive without begging for a day, but in order to respect national laws, I have stopped my activities." It is recently learned that Zhang Shihuang has relapsed and is planning to come to Shanghai to carry out activities again. The Garrison Headquarters yesterday issued orders to its subordinates to pay close attention and prohibit them if found.</p>
<h3>Section Member of the Public Utilities Bureau Accused of Stealing Licenses</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] Last month, the Automobile Industry Association filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing Cheng Yu, a section member of the License Section of the Vehicle Affairs Department of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, of changing his name to Cheng Weiliang during the enemy-puppet period and serving as the director of the Automobile License Section of the Puppet Municipal Government's Construction Bureau.

It was also stated that Cheng Yu currently owns more than ten private cars, none of which have licenses but have been driving in the city for a long time, and asked for an investigation. The District Prosecutor's Office recently summoned Cheng to the case for questioning. Cheng did not deny serving in a puppet position or buying cars, but he stated that he had nothing to do with stealing porcelain licenses. The prosecutor ordered him to be released on bail pending trial.</p>
<h3>A Unique Robbery Case Solved After Half a Year of Investigation</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Dispatch] Last November, a unique robbery case occurred in the city. The culprit, Li Kaihua (38 years old, from Jiaxing), saw an advertisement for the transfer of an empty house at No. 27 Qinyuan Village, Xinzha Road. He conspired with five accomplices: Yang Xiaodi, Leng Kunyuan, Wu Wenxiang, and two surnamed He and Wang, to fraudulently obtain goods by pretending to rent the house.</p>
<p>At the time, Li used the alias Chen Xinyuan and pre-printed business cards of the manager of Xinyuan Silk and Cloth Store. He contacted Mrs. Lu, the original resident of the above address, and agreed to transfer the house for 95 taels of gold. On the spot, he issued a bad check for 12 million yuan dated November 22nd from the Xinchun Qianzhuang. On November 21st, Li led five accomplices disguised as small workers, pretending to decorate the room, and waited there first. At the same time, Li went out to buy two gray-backed coats from Tianfaxiang Fur Store on Henan Road, a large quantity of 桃奎寗 and other Western medicines from Zhongmao Pharmacy on Guangxi Road, ten pieces of woolen cloth from China Woolen Company on Nanjing Road, and three rings and a red gold bracelet from Fang Tianbao Silver Store on Nanjing Road, totaling 21.128 million yuan at the time. All of these were given to Li with the above business cards (at which time the business cards were already printed with the address: No. 27, Lane 224, Xinzha Road, telephone 37056), instructing them to deliver the goods and pay after 4:00 PM on the same day. When the staff members of each store arrived to deliver the goods, Li and others showed their pistols, seized the goods, and drove them into the pavilion room of the house, until all the goods arrived before escaping with the loot. After the incident, the police bureau dispatched officers to investigate, but due to the secretive whereabouts of the criminals, the case could not be solved. It was not until last month that Feng Qishan, the section chief of the Detective Section, received a report that the main criminal, Li Kaihua, was hiding in Jiaxing. After requesting instructions from his superiors, he led section member Feng Xiushan, officers Guo Yuping, Zhang Changgui, Zhang Jianyun, and Fang Tianbao Silver Store employee (Li Shilong, etc.) to go there. However, the criminal had already come to Shanghai, so they tracked him to his Shanghai residence at No. 35, Wuxingqiao, Jumen Road, and finally captured him. After interrogation, he confessed without hesitation and was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<p>Medical and Health</p>
<p>(1) Harmful Effects of Acupuncture</p>
<p>Tong Jianyi asks: I am naturally weak. Last summer, I suffered from scrofula of the neck, followed by Sha disease. After being given acupuncture by a Chinese medicine practitioner, I felt slight pain in my lower abdomen from time to time. Later, due to overwork, my right testicle became hard and enlarged, and painful. I would like to ask: (1) What is this disease? What is the cause? How can it be treated? (2) What medicine should I take for self-treatment? Is taking cod liver oil effective? (3) I have eczema on my scrotum. Is it related to this condition? (4) What foods should I avoid?</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Zhang Zhongming] (1) This is orchitis. Whether it is spermatocytic or inflammatory after acupuncture needs to be determined after examination. (2) Apply Antiphrogestin topically. Take Sulfadiazine anti-inflammatory tablets internally. Cod liver oil is very suitable for scrofula of the neck and tuberculous orchitis. (3) For scrotal eczema, apply 3% salicylic acid ointment or solution. (4) Avoid irritating foods and strenuous exercise.</p>
<p>(2) Loss of Hearing in Both Ears</p>
<p>Yang Aiping asks: My mother is 45 years old. She lost her hearing in both ears in the summer of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945]. Because she lives in a remote village, she did not seek medical treatment. She has not recovered until now. I don't know what the cause is and how to treat it.</p>
<p>[Answer by Dr. Zhang Zhongming] Your mother's deafness is probably caused by nerve weakness due to old age. It is advisable to take vitamin B or phosphorus compounds to supplement it. At the same time, a local examination should be done to see if there are other obstacles.</p>

<h3>Educational Experts in the Capital Hold a Meeting to Discuss Improving University Education. The Main Topic is: Elaborating on the Selection of School Administrators and Principals. Concrete Plans Will be Proposed to the Authorities After Completion.</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing, May 5th, by this newspaper] The symposium of educational experts in the capital was held at National Chengchi University at 3 pm on the 4th. More than 20 people including Cheng Shifan and Cheng Qibao attended. Wang Jingqing chaired the meeting and discussed: "How to stabilize university education to achieve its mission through improving university administration." The following points were generally agreed upon: (1) Currently, university administration is concentrated on the principal alone, and even trivial matters must be managed, preventing them from focusing on leading academic research. It is advisable to change to a "unified teaching and discipline system." "Teaching affairs and moral education" should be managed by the departments of each college. If necessary, a vice-principal can be set up to take charge of school affairs, so that the principal can preside over school administration, lead academic research, and improve educational efficiency. (2) Regarding the selection of principals, it is best to restore the system of selecting and hiring by the university committee during the Cai Yuanpei era, because this system is very effective in France. Even if national universities cannot set up a board of directors like private universities, the government can hire virtuous and capable people from society to form a guidance organization to assist in the process. (3) The appointment and dismissal of university teachers should be decided by the school's appointment committee. (4) For each course, reduce the number of required courses as much as possible and increase the scope of electives. (5) With the implementation of constitutional government, activities of various political parties in universities are inevitable. Students' freedom of thought and speech in schools should not be harmed. Those who disrupt school order and use it as a tool for political struggle should be severely punished. (6) At present, prices are soaring and teachers' lives are difficult. It is urgent to improve the salary standards of professors. The highest should reach 680 yuan, which is equivalent to the legislators and supervisors, so that academic talents will not be drawn into politics. The payment of salaries should be based on the price index. (7) The research equipment of public and private universities should be enriched. The educational administration authorities should overcome budgetary difficulties and take effective measures to stabilize the lives of university professors. The experts present also formed groups to study concrete plans, which will be submitted to the next meeting for approval and recommendations to the educational administration authorities for improvement.</p>
<h3>Students from Three Universities in the Capital Request Exemption from the Comprehensive Graduation Examination</h3>
<p>[Report from Nanjing, May 5th, by this newspaper] This year's graduating students from National Central University, Private Jinling University, and Jinling Women's University requested the Ministry of Education to exempt them from the comprehensive graduation examination as in previous years, but it was not approved. Therefore, the Joint Association of Graduating Students of the Three Universities was established, and it was decided to jointly petition the Ministry of Education with universities and colleges across the country.

<h3>Wuben Students Petitioned Yesterday, Appealing to the Municipal Government and Council About the Disturbance of the Students of the Municipal Teachers College, Requesting a Thorough Investigation of the Responsibility for the Incident and Guaranteeing Future Safety.</h3>
<p>Since the classrooms of the Municipal Wuben Girls' High School were destroyed by the students of the affiliated high school of the Municipal Teachers College, the order has been disrupted and the school has been forced to suspend classes for more than four days. They requested the education authorities to punish the rioters, thoroughly investigate the responsibility for the incident, and guarantee future safety, but there has been no result. All the students were extremely angry and went to the Municipal Education Bureau to petition yesterday (5th) morning. Deputy Director Li received them and the students put forward four requests: (1) Quickly investigate the perpetrators and responsible persons. (2) Request the other party to provide a written guarantee that the same or similar incidents will not occur again and compensate for the damage. (3) Ensure the safety of the school. (4) Ensure that there is a complete and independent school building. Deputy Director Li promised to deal with it appropriately and advised the students to return to school and resume classes. The students felt that Deputy Director Li's reply was empty and expressed their dissatisfaction. In the afternoon, they went to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council to petition. In addition to the aforementioned four requests, they also detailed that the school has a long history. Since the restoration of the school, the school site has been relocated many times due to the lack of a fixed school building, and the students have suffered a lot. Last autumn, they moved to the current site and shared a school building with a boys' school. The students have been insulted by the neighboring school's boys more than once. This time, they were deeply saddened by the disturbance. Today, they are petitioning the administrative authorities and the public opinion organs, and they hope that all parties will uphold justice and urge the competent authorities to earnestly implement the students' requests. It is heard that the Municipal Government and the Council expressed their deep sympathy and promised to do their best to support them. They promised to thoroughly investigate the responsibility for the incident, rectify the school spirit, and find a way to designate an independent and complete school building so that they can study with peace of mind. The students of the school felt satisfied and returned to the school in formation. They can resume classes as soon as all the requests they have made are fully resolved.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Complies with Rice Merchants' Request: Free Trade in Rice Resumes</h3>
<p>Citizens Can Purchase One Dou of Rice Every Half Month with Household Registration Certificates</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Rice price controls have been lifted, and free trade has been permitted to resume starting yesterday. Meanwhile, the Social Affairs Bureau continues to sell 9,000 bags daily to meet the needs of rice shops distributing to households based on registration, with the price remaining at 168,000.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:30 AM, rice industry representatives Qu Zhenhua, Xu Songren, Cha Baosan, Hu Wenan, Cai Shengming, and others visited Mayor Wu at the City Hall. The head of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, Ji Mingzhai, was also present. The rice merchant representatives detailed the actual difficulties caused by the rice controls and requested permission to resume free trade. After an hour of discussion, Mayor Wu finally decided to lift the price controls and allow free trade to resume, hoping that the rice merchants would exercise self-restraint to stabilize prices. The representatives guaranteed that after the resumption of free trade, they would not arbitrarily raise prices and would operate with conscience.</p>
<p>According to Qu Zhenhua, the rice shortage in the market is not due to a lack of supply. It is caused by public panic following the implementation of controls. Recently, more than one hundred rice boats from producing areas arrived in Shanghai, but they all flowed into the black market to avoid price controls, and were purchased in large quantities. Legitimate merchants were unable to purchase rice, leading to today's chaotic rice market situation. Now that free trade is permitted, and the city government continues to allocate rice at a price of 168,000 yuan, it is believed that public sentiment will stabilize.</p>
<p>When interviewed by reporters, Mayor Wu stated that after the resumption of free trade, the city government would continue to release 9,000 bags daily for allocation. The responsible authorities will publicly announce the daily quantity of rice released from the warehouse and the rice shops allocated, while also distributing the list to each police precinct and district office. The police precinct will dispatch personnel to supervise the rice shops' distribution in the same quantity with the district residents' representatives to prevent hoarding. Ordinary citizens can purchase one dou of rice from rice shops with their household registration certificates within a half-month period, limited to five dou per household. The purchase date and quantity must be written on the household registration certificate, and the rice shop must record and report it to the district office and police precinct daily. Those unwilling to purchase with a certificate or wishing to purchase more can obtain it from the free market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 2,687 shi of goods arrived in the northern and southern markets. There were also more than 5,000 shi of goods from Hexia. Rice merchant representatives voluntarily temporarily limited the transaction price of white japonica rice in the market to 240,000 yuan and the retail price to 250,000 yuan, but no one was willing to buy at that price. The rice shops, due to the small amount of allocated rice, had many citizens lining up to purchase, which easily caused disputes. Therefore, many were unwilling to register and sell the allocated rice yesterday.</p>
<h3>Flour and Cooking Oil Rise Sharply in Tandem</h3>
<p>Yesterday, flour prices rose by more than 10,000 yuan, and imported flour jumped by nearly 20,000 yuan. Wheat bran was in great demand, surging by more than 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake transactions were brisk, rising by another 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Soybeans rose by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan, and raw peanuts were actively traded, surging by more than 10,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were extremely popular, advancing by more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Red sorghum and corn alcohol continued to be popular, both increasing by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Broad beans were scarce and expensive, rapidly advancing by 10,000 yuan. Red beans were scarce in both supply and demand, temporarily unchanged. Mung beans remained firm.</p>
<p>The oil market was very bullish, soaring and rising sharply by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. All grains experienced a comprehensive price surge.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Slightly Retreat After Rising</h3>
<p>Public bonds retreated slightly yesterday after rising. Unified C opened at 19,300 yuan in the morning, with a low of 18,600 yuan and a high of 21,500 yuan. At noon, it hovered around 19,500 yuan. Rooms 512 and 555 and Runde were buying, while rooms 550 and 503 and others were selling. As a result, compared to last Saturday, A, B, D, and E slightly declined by 200 to 300 yuan, while unified bonds slightly rose by 200 yuan, with a total transaction volume of approximately 12 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks See High Prices with More Buying</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks saw increased buying from foreign firms and money shops yesterday, aiming to maintain currency value. Ewo Silk rose steadily after opening at 80,000 and British American Tobacco at 118,000 yuan. It slightly fluctuated near noon. In the afternoon, Hong Kong exchange rates were favorable, continuing to see high prices. Ewo Silk reached 85,800 yuan and British American Tobacco reached 147,000 yuan, before slightly retreating. Banks showed an appetite for steel, while securities firms took profits after substantial gains. As a result, compared to last Saturday, British American Tobacco and Jardine Matheson rose by over 20%, while Ewo Silk, Ewo Brewery, shipping, steel, telephone, and Kailan Mining rose by over 10%. Plantations and rubber shares also saw strong gains.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Tightens Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained resilient due to the undecided date for Taikoo Sugar's resumption of allocation.

<h3>Simplified Regulations for Application and Review of Yarn and Cloth Exports to Hebei and Northeast; Registered Manufacturers Must Meet Three Qualifications</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Textile Control Committee has recently formulated (1) Simplified Regulations for Application and Review of Yarn and Cloth Exports to Hebei and Northeast Ports and (2) Simplified Regulations for Application and Review of Internal Transit Exports, based on the three measures for stabilizing yarn and cloth previously promulgated by the Executive Yuan. The former will be announced and implemented from today. The latter is still awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs before being announced and implemented.</p>
<p>According to Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Department of the Committee, the content of the measures for controlling yarn and cloth exports to Hebei and Northeast ports is generally the same as the measures for controlling yarn and cloth exports to the south. Registration procedures for manufacturers will begin tomorrow (the 6th). Manufacturers in this city are limited to applying for registration within one week. Manufacturers in other cities are limited to applying for registration within three weeks. Factories that have already registered and qualified in the yarn and cloth export to the south case do not need to apply for registration again, but they need to fill in a new seal card. All distributors need to apply for registration. Manufacturers applying for registration must meet the following three qualifications:</p>
<p>(1) Must be a member of the trade association; (2) Must be approved and registered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the local Social Affairs Bureau; (3) Must have previously engaged in this business. If it is a branch of a manufacturer in another city, the manufacturer must also possess the above qualifications.</p>
<p>Distributors must provide the following proof: (A) Business ledgers for yarn and cloth exports to Hebei and Northeast from January to March of this year; (B) Customs documents for yarn and cloth exports to Hebei and Northeast from January to March of this year, so that the Committee can determine the quota for approval.</p>
<p>The quota for yarn and cloth exports to Hebei and Northeast is determined with reference to the registered yarn and cloth import quantities of the customs in these areas in 1930, according to the ratio of the current domestic yarn and cloth production volume to the pre-war domestic yarn and cloth production volume, and considering the local supply and demand situation. It is stipulated that the monthly import of cotton yarn into Hebei and Northeast ports is 3,456 pieces and cotton cloth is 124,164 bolts. The Simplified Regulations for Application and Review of Yarn and Cloth Exports to Hebei and Northeast Ports are transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Simplified Regulations for Application and Review of Yarn and Cloth Exports to Hebei and Northeast Ports:</p>
<p>(Article 1) The Textile Business Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) hereby formulates these simplified regulations in order to handle the management of yarn and cloth exports to Hebei and Northeast ports under orders.</p>
<p>(Article 2) Manufacturers who apply for the allocation of yarn and cloth to be exported to Hebei and Northeast ports must fill out a yarn and cloth export application form, have the type and quantity certified by the selling manufacturer, and submit it to the Committee or its designated affiliated agency for review.</p>
<p>(Article 3) The applicant manufacturer must be a member of the trade association, be approved and registered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the local Social Affairs Bureau, and have previously engaged in this business. If it is a branch of a manufacturer in another city, the manufacturer must also possess the above qualifications.</p>
<p>(Article 4) The monthly quantity of yarn and cloth allowed to be exported to Hebei and Northeast ports is determined with reference to the pre-war yarn and cloth import quantities of these areas, according to the ratio of the current domestic yarn and cloth production volume to the pre-war domestic yarn and cloth production volume, and considering the current supply and demand situation.</p>
<p>(Article 5) The monthly quantity of cotton yarn allowed to be exported is allocated by the Committee according to the number of spindles in each registered yarn factory. If a factory does not need to export its products in a certain month, its share of the export quantity will be withdrawn by the Committee and reallocated.</p>
<p>(Article 6) The monthly quantity of cotton cloth allowed to be exported is determined by the Committee based on the past transportation quantities of each registered distributor, the production situation of each textile printing and dyeing factory, and the market supply and demand situation, and quotas are allocated separately.</p>
<p>(Article 7) Manufacturers must declare and export within ten days from the date of obtaining the export license. The export license will be invalid if it expires. Export licenses shall not be transferred privately. If any violations occur, in addition to invalidating the license, all rights of the manufacturer will be revoked.</p>
<p>(Article 8) The application and licensing regulations for yarn and cloth exported to other parts of the country besides Hebei and Northeast ports are specified separately.</p>
<p>Article 9 These simplified regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] It is reported that after the government controlled yarn and cloth exports to the south and north to Hebei and Northeast ports, there is still an insufficient amount of yarn and cloth to meet demand beyond the yarn and cloth quota. It has been directed that the China Textile Construction Company should find ways to transport and sell to supplement the needs of these areas.</p>
<h3>Chunlan Loans: Application Procedures Begin</h3>
<p>The Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry held a meeting the day before yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM and passed a resolution: If silk manufacturers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang who received loans from the National Bank last year have fully repaid them before the end of last month and have qualified guarantees, they can apply for loans to purchase this year's spring silk. Starting yesterday, more than thirty manufacturers in this city have gone to the Committee to obtain application forms. The deadline is set for the 8th. The Committee also plans to formulate application loan standards, which will be announced today or tomorrow. The approved amount for each factory will be determined separately at a meeting convened by the Committee to ensure prudence.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks See Slight Movement in Retail Sales; Market Starts Weak but Strengthens Later</h3>
<p>Although some Chinese stocks were sold off yesterday and there was some activity in retail sales, there was a sense of powerlessness to advance in the middle of the session. However, due to high reports from the Hong Kong market, the number of chips remained scarce. In addition to Meiya and other stocks hitting their daily limit, Yongsha also became firm at the end.</p>
<p>The market opened higher in the morning. Yongsha advanced after opening, with numbers 142, 169, 94, 232, 205, and 152 all advancing. Meiya first hit its daily limit due to the positive news of the shareholders' extraordinary meeting. Jinglun and Commerce also hit their daily limit. The number of chips was very scarce, and Yongsha rose to 6,540 yuan. Numbers 185, 12, and 218 took profits at the high and retreated to 6,460 yuan. Numbers 142 and 152 bought, rising to 6,558 yuan. Yongye also hit its daily limit. Numbers 105, 83, 97, and 85 sold off, retreating again to 6,500 yuan, after which it entered a long period of consolidation.</p>
<p>After 10:40 AM, due to news of the black market for gold banknotes rising and foreign stocks soaring, investor confidence began to revive. Numbers 89, 99, 14, 36, 76, and 197 all advanced, and Yongsha rose to 6,640 yuan. Numbers 33, 191, 179, 129, 154, and 231 sold at the high, especially number 129, which was the most active buyer, dropping back to 6,480 yuan. Numbers 112, 89, 145, 77, 153, 76, and 224 advanced, investor confidence was stable, and cement also hit its daily limit. Near noon, Yongsha rose again to over 6,600 yuan, but number 129 still sold off.</p>
<p>At noon, it hovered around 6,550 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Huafeng was flat, Yongsha and Jingfu rose by half a percent, Xinguang, Qinxing, Zhongfa, and Xinhua rose slightly, Xinho and Yonggong rose by one percent, and Meiya hit its daily limit. In terms of delivery, Huafeng was flat, Meiya hit its daily limit, and Yongsha, Xinho, Yonggong, Jingfu, and Qinxing each rose by a little over half a percent.</p>

Numbers 106, 95, 218, 35, 145, 16, and 152 bought in one after another, closing at a high price of 6,700 yuan.</p>
<p>After closing, numbers 223, 152, and 237 all supplemented their positions, and the final bid was as high as around 6,780 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Meiya hit its daily limit, Yongsha, Xinho, and Yonggong Jingfu rose by about 10%, Xinhua and Qinxing and Xinguang each rose by half a percent, Zhongfa rose slightly, and Huafeng was the only one that was flat.

<h3>This Month's Flour Allocation Method: All Procedures Remain the Same</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] Rong Jingren, the person in charge of the Fuxin Flour Mill, recently went to Beijing to discuss maintaining the flour allocation in this city for May, and has now returned to Shanghai after completing his mission. He said that the flour allocation method in this city for this month will remain the same. The allocation price and quantity will not be changed for the time being.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Wine Brewing New Price</h3>
<p>Due to the sharp rise in rice prices, the cost of incoming Shaoxing wine has increased sharply. Although prices have risen gradually, they still cannot offset the cost of later goods. There were no transactions in the market yesterday, and the industry is currently gathering to discuss new prices.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Sales Remain Strong; Bids Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>--Purchases by Factories on This Street Are Relatively Weak--</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th), the Textile Construction Company opened sales of 42-count Tiannv yarn at 9.98 million, 40-count Wuzi yarn at 8.86 million, 32-count Xiantao yarn at 6.96 million, 20-count Shuiyue yarn at 4.6 million, 16-count Feihu yarn at 4.16 million, and 10-count Tongzigun yarn at 3.29 million. The opening prices were the same as the previous period.</p>
<p>Bids in the market continued to rise, especially for 16-count and 20-count coarse yarns, which saw even stronger gains, rising by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Fine yarns also rose by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. The highest price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn reached 14.2 million yuan, with the final price at 13.9 million yuan. It is reported that buyers were actively adding positions, but purchases by factories on this street were relatively weak, and those holding goods still had a tendency to hoard.</p>
<h3>Over 1,000 Bags of Hoarded Yarn Seized</h3>
<p>[Reported by Our Newspaper] In order to stabilize yarn prices and prohibit hoarding, the Economic Division of the Garrison Headquarters ordered that, from May 1, any yarn merchants found to have yarn in storage for more than one and a half months must be forced to sell it back to the government at the original price. As the deadline has now passed, the Economic Division has been dispatching personnel to inspect the warehouses of manufacturers for several days. It is reported that from May 1 to 3, more than 1,000 bags of yarn have been found in storage for more than one and a half months, and there are even cases of yarn purchased in February of last year that has not yet been sold. The Economic Division is continuing its investigation, and at the same time, it has compiled a list of these manufacturers who disregard the law and the quantity of yarn in their storage and reported it to Commander Xuan, who will notify the Textile Control Committee to recover it at the original price in accordance with the previous order.</p>
<h3>Treasury Department Stipulates Method for Using U.S. Treasury Bonds as Reserve Funds</h3>
<p>Regarding the use of U.S. Treasury bonds by banks and money shops in this city to offset part of the deposit reserve funds with the National Bank, the National Bank received a clear order from the Treasury Department yesterday. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Banks, money shops, and trust companies in all areas that are required to deposit deposit reserve funds with the Central Bank may use short-term treasury bonds of the 36th year that are owned by the bank, money shop, or company as a substitute for half of the reserve funds.</p>
<p>(2) After each bank, money shop, or trust company uses these treasury bonds to pay the equivalent of half of the required reserve funds, whenever there is an increase or decrease in the required reserves, the increase or decrease in the amount to be paid or recovered shall be paid or recovered in national currency in accordance with the original regulations of the Treasury Department. However, in January and July of each year, if each bank, money shop, or company has paid cash or recovered cash in the past, resulting in the treasury bonds paid exceeding half of the total required reserve funds, the excess amount shall be exchanged for cash in that month. If it is less than half, treasury bonds may be used to make up half in that month and exchange for cash.</p>
<h3>The Export Promotion Committee Passes Two Important Cases</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon at approximately 3:00 PM at the Central Bank. Vice Chairman Chen Guangfu was absent due to other business and was replaced by Wu Sida as acting chairman. The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM. Two important cases were passed: (1) Measures for the import of processed raw materials, to be handled in four procedures. All rules regarding the permitted import quantities and penalties for violating the measures are stipulated. These measures still need to be submitted to the Export Control Committee for discussion and approval. (2) For the export of soybeans, sesame, peanuts, rapeseed, and their extracted oil, if trade has already been concluded before the customs authorities issue quantitative export permits, withdrawal will be permitted provided it does not exceed our country's allocated quota under the International Emergency Food Council.</p>
<h3>Rayon Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>Although there is news of rayon allocation, the selling price will inevitably increase. Therefore, yesterday, the market was quite firm. 120 Gaoshan Yu Guang opened at 19 million yuan and closed at 8.8 million yuan, hovering around the price range in the morning, with only 1-2 boxes traded. In the afternoon, the asking price decreased by 200,000 yuan, but the final price was still 500,000 yuan higher than last weekend. There was not much change in the factories. Grade B was traded at 10 bales, priced at 21 million yuan, and there were few other transactions. Except for Dacheng plaid which started firm but weakened later, there were no major price fluctuations in other silk fabrics.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Credit Yarn</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, totaling 1,867 pieces, all sold to manufacturers. There were a total of 784 applications from manufacturers.</p>
<h3>New Cotton Cloth Purchases Still Active</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened steadily. Most of the trading on the market was still dominated by new buyers. Customer demand became stagnant. Transactions of spot warehouse receipts among the industry were quite active, leading to a firm market sentiment. Four Gentlemen Gold Seal Drill cloth rose from 296,000 yuan to 298,000 yuan, with buyers rushing to purchase, but the price stabilized after fewer transactions. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose from 310,000 yuan to 325,000 yuan, Five Blessings rose by more than 20,000 yuan from 300,500 yuan, and 20-count extra fine cloth rose by 5,000 yuan from 251,000 yuan. The markets for other colored cloth and Shilin cloth were also bullish.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Transactions Stagnant</h3>
<p>For red and green tea specifically for export, local export firms, considering that the current overseas selling price is lower than the domestic price, have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, transactions have remained extremely stagnant for several days. The trend is for the market to continue to float aimlessly amidst a lack of market confidence, and the foundation remains precarious. As for various types of tea for domestic sale, sales are also generally sluggish. However, because sellers are still generally stable in their thinking, the process is relatively calm.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] China's four major export commodities, tea, have shown a state of decline in foreign sales since overseas selling prices became incongruent with domestic prices. Recently, new tea from various producing areas has been emerging like bamboo shoots after rain. However, because tea merchants have not yet sold out their old tea, they are generally hesitant to purchase new tea. Therefore, it is said that the market in the producing areas is not very active at the moment.</p>
<h3>Industrial Raw Materials Soaring</h3>
<p>The market for industrial raw materials soared again across the board yesterday. Few transactions occurred after the market closed, and those holding goods were unusually firm in their convictions. Although buyers offered high prices, they had difficulty making purchases. In the caustic soda market, everyone expected 15 million yuan, and the asking prices were chaotic. Although raw material merchants claimed 8.5 million yuan, this was limited to purchases, and they claimed there were no goods available for sale. N rosin and petroleum jelly have only risen by 60%, which triggered buying interest, and the market also surged fiercely yesterday.</p>

<h3>Watching Tani Hisao's Execution at Yuhuatai</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua of this newspaper</p>
<p>Nanjing, April 27th, Quick Dispatch</p>
<p>Tani Hisao, the executioner of the Nanjing Massacre, was finally executed today in front of the people of Nanjing. Although he has been executed by shooting, it still cannot compensate for the loss of those innocent victims. Zhonghua Gate and Yuhuatai were where Tani Hisao once dominated, but today they became the execution grounds where he was killed. He must have thought of the tragedy: "The mountains and rivers have changed, but the vegetation remains the same. The same area, but two different scenes." Those who wielded violence could not escape their fate. The net of heaven is vast, not only did the people of Nanjing cheer, but "humanity" and "justice" also dealt a great blow to the brutal.</p>
<p>Suddenly Changed Color, Stuttering</p>
<p>This morning, the Xiaoying War Criminals Detention Center also opened a temporary court. Court President Shi Meiyu and several military judges came to supervise. At 9:10 AM, Prosecutor Chen Guangyu and Clerk Zhang Diantong ascended the court and brought Tani from prison. Today, Tani Hisao was still so stubborn. The prosecutor routinely asked the defendant's name, age, place of origin, and experience, and threw the peace-reporting letters sent by the defendant's relatives to him. After the defendant read them, he asked, "Do you need to reply to these letters?" Tani Hisao's expression suddenly changed at this point, and he stuttered, "I hope you will let me write." While speaking, his throat choked, and he could hardly speak. After obtaining permission, Tani took out a pencil from his body and tremblingly wrote the last few letters bidding farewell to the world. After finishing the letters, the prosecutor read out the instructions from the National Government: "According to the National (36) Judgment No. 107 submitted by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense on March 19th of this year, and attachments, all are understood. After investigation, the defendant Tani Hisao jointly massacred prisoners of war and non-combatants during the war, and raped, robbed, and destroyed property. Since the interrogation has clearly confirmed that he is indeed guilty, the death penalty is appropriate and should be approved." Tani continued to argue as before. The prosecutor, tired of his endless babbling, again asked the defendant if he had any will for his family. Tani was forced to ask for paper to write a will.</p>
<p>A Will, Two Lines of Tears</p>
<p>At this time, hundreds of eyes in the temporary court were focused on Tani, watching him write his last will. The reporter approached Tani and saw a Japanese translator reading the words Tani was writing. The reporter then used shorthand to record the original text. The following is his will to his wife: "To Tani Umeko. Tani Hisao, April 16, Showa 23. My death sentence is about to be carried out. Before I knew the execution date, I had written another letter. Now, I am sending it together with this will as a memento of our eternal separation. Umeko! We cannot grow old together, but you have fulfilled your responsibilities as a wife, and I am deeply grateful. Under the judgment of the Chinese side, I am now to be executed, which is truly regrettable. But whether I have committed international crimes, I believe there will be a day when the truth will be revealed. It doesn't matter to me personally. Although I am shot in Yuhuatai, I have finally fulfilled my last duty to repay the country. Please help Katsumi and Chikaotwo brothers and raise Kiyoko and Hideko to become useful people. Although I die in a foreign land, my soul will eventually fly back to my hometown. At noon on April 26, I will say goodbye to everyone and then say goodbye forever. May you all be happy. Now, I can still stand and say goodbye to everyone, but in a little while, I will fall to the ground. This is unfortunate, but it is also fate. The journey of my life is over. My last state will be seen by Lieutenant General Takahashi and Staff Officer Ogasawara, and they can tell you. Sixty-six years old has become the last year of my life, but all along, I have not thought that I was wrong. I tried my best to the very end, but I was finally shot, which is really regrettable. My dear Umeko, farewell forever! Please cremate my remains and bring my ashes back. May the Tani family be happy! Umeko, farewell!" After finishing the family letter, he immediately wrote a few more sentences to bid farewell to his fellow war criminals Isogu, Tsuchibashi, Uchida, Takahashi, and others. While writing, he was still calm, but when he presented the will to the prosecutor with both hands, his eyes were full of tears. Although he did not shed tears, it is not difficult to imagine the depth of the remorse in the heart of this demon before his death.</p>
<p>Clearing Belongings, Petty to the End</p>
<p>At this time, it was already 10:50 AM. Tani Hisao asked to go to the detention center to sort out his belongings, but the prosecutor did not allow it and only allowed him to sort them out in the courtroom. Thirty minutes later, a soldier brought a standard Japanese-style green and white patterned large package and placed it next to the defendant's bar. The scene was like a servant bidding farewell to his master. The black coat and gray felt hat he wore when he was escorted to China were also among them. At this time, Tani Hisao squatted on the ground and slowly sorted out his belongings, dividing them into three parts. One part was entrusted to the liaison team to be sent back to Japan to his family. Another package of worn clothes was distributed to his fellow prisoners, including a pair of 60% new woolen pants and a pair of socks, specifically designated for war criminal Lieutenant General Takahashi. In addition, a black-barreled fountain pen was to be returned to Ogasawara, a Japanese member of the liaison team. In addition, a map borrowed from the Ministry of National Defense for the trial was also handed over to the court for return to the Ministry of National Defense. During this process, he was still very free in the courtroom. As long as he could think of any items, the soldier would find them for him. When he wrote the will, Warden Huang of the detention center even specially asked him to smoke a yellow-wrapped cigarette, which could be said to be his last enjoyment in this life! While he was sorting out his belongings, he fully demonstrated the pettiness of the Japanese. He even shook the few matchboxes placed in the drawer to see how many matches were left in the box, and he put them in the package. Time passed by minute by minute. His life also seemed to be getting shorter and shorter. At this time, knowing that he was about to be executed, he took off his black cotton shoes and put on his black leather shoes. He also put on the beige gloves that he used to hold his command sword on both hands, and after the prosecutor issued the order to escort him to the execution ground, he put on his old felt hat and was pushed by the military police holding Tani's arms onto the large truck parked in the courtyard to be escorted to the execution ground.</p>
<p>Crowds of People Wherever the Execution Vehicle Passed</p>
<p>After the car left the Xiaoying Detention Center, it passed through Zhujiang Road, Beiting Lane, Daxing Palace, Taiping Road, Jiankang Road, Zhonghua Road, and Zhonghua Gate, coming for another "out of the city ceremony", driving directly to the Yuhuatai execution ground outside Zhonghua Gate. At this moment, I don't know what memories were evoked in Tani. Tani stood in the front half of the truck, with his hands on the roof, watching the war crimes tribunal distributing leaflets printed with his execution along the way. Every street caused a commotion, and the number of people following the execution vehicle numbered in the thousands, all wanting to see the last scene of the Nanjing Massacre's chief culprit being executed.</p>
<p>A Shot Rang Out, Applause Erupted</p>
<p>The execution vehicle was traveling very slowly, and the crowd of onlookers was getting more and more crowded. Everyone temporarily put aside their work and looked up. Many people on Sanshan Street even hired jitney cars to rush to Yuhuatai. The Yuhuatai hill had already been piled up with people two hours earlier. When the execution vehicle approached the execution ground, the entire traffic outside Zhonghua Gate had been cut off. At 11:35 AM, it arrived at the execution ground. A burst of applause came from the hilltop. The evil demon, who did not realize his mistake until his death, could no longer maintain his composure. A pale and very ugly face clearly showed his fear. The military police held him and walked ten steps before stopping, allowing reporters to use their "cameras" to leave a record of his fierce appearance at the moment before his death. Finally, they had him stand facing north and with his back to the south on the execution ground. The two military police holding him were tightly grasped by him, as if he was asking them to save his life, showing that pitiful appearance. After the prosecutor ordered the execution, the gunman aimed at the back of Tani's head and "bang" went the shot. Tani fell to the ground like this, and the crowd on the hill responded with great applause. Ten years of blood debt, today it finally paid back a little when the shot rang out. However, to think that using one Tani Hisao to compensate for the grievances of 400,000 people is really too cheap for him. However, he finally paid with his life, which is also very satisfying.</p>

<h3>Weekday Forum: Prospects of the Indian Political Situation</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Zhongyong</p>
<p>On February 22nd of this year, British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons that Britain would withdraw from India starting on June 1st of next year. This marks the beginning of a new chapter in the history of British-Indian relations. Looking back at the various political reforms and proposals made by Britain in India in the past, they have consistently failed to satisfy the desires of Indian nationalism. The crux of the matter lies in the fact that Britain had not clearly declared the date for the transfer of power to India. Prime Minister Attlee's decisive statement has brought a bright future to India. It is not difficult for us to imagine how elated and overjoyed Indian nationalists will be. The goal of "complete independence" that the National Congress Party has strived for with great difficulty for sixty years is no longer far off. How can they not rejoice and celebrate!</p>
<p>However, upon reflecting on the reality of India, sectarian divisions and internal contradictions obstruct unification at every turn. On one hand, the conflict between Hindus and Muslims seems to have reached an irreconcilable state. The Muslim League insists on "Pakistan," a separation from the "Hindustan" of the Hindu Indians. On the other hand, the princely states of India, which account for two-fifths of the total Indian territory and are scattered like stars, maintain their monarchical traditions since the Middle Ages, observe the Hindu-Muslim conflict from the sidelines, subtly assert themselves, and remain indifferent to the future unification of India. Therefore, the bright prospects of India are still obscured by a dark shadow. From the Indian interim government to the British transfer of power to India, it is a transitional period of uncertainty in Indian politics. The latent internal contradictions are becoming increasingly acute. The political struggle between the Congress Party and the Muslim League is still raging fiercely. The future independent India will be transformed amidst this complex and divergent situation.</p>
<p>Will the future independent India emerge as a "unified, independent, and sovereign republic"? Or will it arise as two sovereign states, "Pakistan" and "Hindustan"? Or will it unfold in the form of more independent states, similar to the dominions within the British Empire? Will the British ruling power be transferred to one Indian government? Or to several Indian governments? Through what procedure will it be transferred? These fundamental questions are what the British, Indian, Muslim League, and princely states are currently considering, mutually contending, and jointly discussing.</p>
<p>During the transition period, the responsibility of promoting the administration of British India is borne by the Indian interim government, with Nehru as Deputy Prime Minister. The responsibility of formulating the future constitution of India, in order to give birth to a new government and receive the transfer of power from the British side, is borne by the Constituent Assembly. The Muslim League, which opposes the Congress Party, while participating in the executive department of the Indian interim government, has repeatedly refused to send representatives to join the Constituent Assembly, which decides the future of India. Its participation in the interim government is likely to emulate the Congress Party's policy of "internal obstruction" against the British scheme of participating in the provincial administration from 1937 to 1939, and does not cooperate sincerely with Mr. Nehru and the Congress Party. Mr. Nehru, internally, feels the restrictions and friction from the Muslim League cabinet members, and externally, is distracted by the Hindu-Muslim bloody struggles that are spreading everywhere, unable to cope, and construction is difficult to implement. Therefore, Nehru suggested to the British that the interim government be responsible to the Constituent Assembly, so that the Constituent Assembly becomes a sovereign body, in order to force the Muslim League to join the Constituent Assembly or withdraw from the interim government.</p>
<p>The Muslim League's persistent refusal to join the Constituent Assembly not only affects the smooth progress of constitution-making but also strengthens the position of the die-hard faction of the British Conservative Party. Churchill criticized the Constituent Assembly, stating that if the Muslim League does not participate, it can only represent the Hindu Indians and cannot represent India, and therefore its decisions are not worthy of respect from the British Cabinet. Prasad, Chairman of the Constituent Assembly, responded with an important statement, listing the composition of the representatives of the previous Constituent Assembly. Of the 296 members elected through elections, 210 attended; the number of Hindu Indian seats was 160, and 155 attended; 33 representatives of the general class, and 30 attended; 7 Christians, and 6 attended; 5 members of backward tribal peoples, 5 Anglo-Indians, 5 Sikhs (that is, those who are employed by the British as constables, soldiers, policemen, turbaned and bearded, all belong to this religion), and 3 Parsis (that is, fire worshippers who migrated from Persia, totaling 115,000 people, concentrated in Mumbai, possessing strong financial resources in industry and commerce), all attended; 80 Muslims, and 4 attended. Therefore, except for the absence of members of the Muslim League, the Constituent Assembly represents various sects, classes, and races. Churchill's criticism is indeed malicious. The Constituent Assembly has adjourned twice, hoping for the participation of the Muslim League. On April 28, the third session was held. Nehru proposed at the meeting to welcome the free participation of various princely states. Only eight princely states have participated in the meeting, with five representatives appointed by the princes and sixteen representatives elected by the people. The higher-level princely states are willing to become independent countries after Britain leaves India. Of course, they will not participate in the Constituent Assembly. Nehru's appeal is unlikely to move the patriotic hearts of the princes, especially the Muslim princes. "Interests" and "security" are the considerations that princes weigh when deciding whether to participate in the Constituent Assembly, because they know very well that once they join a unified Indian central federal government, many of the princes' privileges will be transferred to or restricted by the central government. In this Constituent Assembly, the Muslim League still refused to participate. Last week, Ali Khan, the second leader of the Muslim League, declared: "The Constituent Assembly is dead and cannot be revived." Therefore, the Congress Party's hope of the Muslim League participating in the meeting has become a bubble.</p>
<p>Analyzing the recent developments in India, it can be seen that although India is approaching the door of independence, it is heading towards the path of division. The leaders of the Congress Party, who have always aimed at unified governance, have no choice but to compromise with reality in this situation. Currently, the Congress Party's attitude towards "Pakistan" is no longer a dispute over whether it should be realized, but a negotiation on how to implement it. What Viceroy Mountbatten and Gandhi, Jinnah, and others have been discussing for four weeks is to solicit opinions, draft the outline of the Hindu-Muslim division of governance, and the steps for the British transfer of power. There are two ways to divide India: one is complete division, that is, the full implementation of Jinnah's Pakistan proposal, with the current provincial boundaries as the dividing line, the west including the Northwest Frontier Province, Balochistan, Sindh Province, and Punjab Province, and the east including Bengal and Assam Province; the other is conditional division, that is, the counties in the Pakistan provinces where Sikh Indians and Hindu Indians constitute the majority should be separated from Pakistan and added to "Hindustan." The Sikh Indians of Punjab Province have proposed the slogan of "Sikhistan" division to Jinnah's "Pakistan." Furthermore, the Muslims in the Northwest Frontier Province and other places, under the leadership of Abdu Ghaffar Khan, known as the "Frontier Gandhi," have always supported the Congress Party. A plebiscite should be held for all citizens of the Frontier Province to decide whether they are willing to join "Pakistan."</p>
<p>Under British rule, the political regions of India are divided into two: the eleven provinces of British India and the princely states of India. The British announced the Government of India Act of 1935, which is the constitution of India, divided into two parts. The provincial autonomy part has been implemented in the eleven provinces. The central federal government part has been suspended due to differing opinions among the Congress Party, the Muslim League, and the princely states. Therefore, the current central government in Delhi, India, is operating in accordance with the Government of India Act of 1919. The Constituent Assembly meeting in Delhi is formulating a new constitution for India after independence in order to transfer power. Although the Muslim League's refusal to participate in the constitution and its insistence on Pakistan's partition, the Constituent Assembly, having included all sects, classes, races, and a few princely states other than the Muslim League, truly represents the majority opinion of India. Its constitution-making will be more active. The content of the constitution will adapt to the complex environment of India. In principle, it aims to be applicable to all of India, whether it is the original British province or the princely state. In principle, it will make it applicable to each region. Therefore, after independence, three political divisions will emerge in India, namely "Hindustan," "Pakistan," and the "Princely States Group." For the sake of common military defense and economic mutual assistance, these three may form a very loose "Confederation."</p>
<p>When British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons that Britain would withdraw from India, he had anticipated the possible disputes that might arise within India. Therefore, the content of his statement is worth considering again. The main points are: (1) Britain hopes that the major Indian parties will cooperate sincerely and form a government to succeed British rule; (2) During the transition period before withdrawal, Viceroy Wavell was dismissed and Lord Mountbatten succeeded him; (3) The constitutional proposal and principles proposed by the British Cabinet Mission to India last year have not changed; (4) If the Indian parties still fail to formulate a constitution by the time the withdrawal period arrives, then Britain may transfer ruling power to the provincial governments; (5) Britain has no intention of transferring the ruling power and obligations of the various princely states to the Indian central government. During the transition period, the relationship between the British monarch and the various princely states will be adjusted through agreements. These points can be said to be the principles on which Britain's withdrawal from India is based. Three points are worth noting: (1) The British side does not exert pressure on any party to promote unification but hopes that the major Indian parties will compromise and negotiate on their own to form a government to succeed British rule; (2) If a constitution is not formed by the deadline and the Indian government is difficult to establish, the ruling power will also be transferred to the current eleven provinces of British India; (3) Britain's supreme authority over the princely states remains and does not disappear due to Britain's withdrawal, nor does it transfer with Britain's transfer of the ruling power of India to the Indian government.</p>
<p>Britain's definite statement to withdraw from India on a fixed date and grant India independence is truly worthy of worldwide praise. However, sacrificing unification to strive for independence and bringing about division with independence cannot but be a concern for India. This is caused by the historical factors of Britain's more than two hundred years of rule in India.</p>
<p>Britain's rule in India has enabled all of India, except for a few regions, to live under a central power, which was unprecedented in the history of India and was a pioneering event in Indian politics. Britain's rule has brought stability to Indian society, with no wars or internal conflicts, which is also a fact. Britain's political measures and educational enlightenment have also contributed to the growth of Indian nationalism. However, upon deeper reflection, Britain's rule has failed to dedicate itself to the integration of Indian sects and the harmonization of differences, but has instead tolerated, supported, and fueled them for the sake of the ruler's security. This is excusable, but for the sake of the future of the Indian nation, it is a dangerous step. The bloody tragedies between Hindus and Muslims in recent months have further emboldened the reactionary faction to argue forcefully, proving the legitimacy and necessity of British rule. No Indian army officer has been promoted to the rank of brigadier. Even if the British return the Indian government, military power must still rely on the British General Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army. This is because, on one hand, Indian military personnel are of low rank and have no qualifications, and on the other hand, if a Hindu or Muslim Indian were to hold this position, it would inevitably cause sectarian disputes. This example alone shows that unified governance in India is difficult, and division also has many problems. Let us pay attention to the development of the Indian political situation in the future!</p>

<h3>A Bachelor's Confession</h3>
<p>— By德·蘇德曼, Translated by 林鳳藻</p>
<p>Ah, dear madam, it is so good to be here, to be with you again, quietly sitting in this comfortable chair, chatting with you at leisure. Thank goodness the holiday turmoil is over, and you can spare some time to be with me again.</p>
<p>Ah, this Christmas season! I believe the devil stirred it up, especially to trouble us bachelors, making those of us without families feel the boredom of life. For others it is a source of joy, but for us it is a real pain. Of course, of course, not every bachelor is lonely; most of us can bring joy to others and find joy ourselves. But this shared joy has a bitter taste; partly because we criticize ourselves with mocking, and partly because we have that acidic expectation: this expectation, I might say, is not homesickness, but a desire for marriage.</p>
<p>You will ask: why not hurry up and "run the rice" (a euphemism for courtship), and pour out your heart? You are a sympathetic person; while most women resent me, you always generously offer me comfort. Ah, you must know, this is not a simple matter. On the third day of this Christmas, you guessed my heart accurately and gave me Spyder's tediously interesting "Lonely Little Sparrow"; do you know what Master Spyder says in that book? He says, "A true bachelor is beyond consolation; after being unhappy, he is willing to remain unhappy."</p>
<p>Besides Spyder's lonely little sparrow, there is also a kind of old bachelor who is a friend of families. I don't mean those who specialize in disrupting families: those who, while enjoying other people's fireside, hypocritically hint at their ulterior motives. I don't mean that kind of person; I mean the good uncle to the children, the good uncle, the old classmate of the children's father; these people put the children on their laps and caress them, while respectfully reciting stories from the evening paper to their mother—stories with indecent parts, of course, omitted.</p>
<p>I know many people who always serve their friends' families; these people live in those families, stay with lovely women, feel great affection in their hearts, but have no desire.</p>
<p>You don't believe me? Ah, perhaps you don't approve of the words "without desire"? You may be right. In the depths of the most docile heart, perhaps there lurks a rough desire, but you must know that this desire is under control.</p>
<p>I can give you an example. I tell you: what two old men talked about on this New Year's Eve. You are not allowed to ask me how I know their conversation, and you cannot tell this to others. Shall we begin?</p>
<p>Please imagine a scene first. An old-fashioned room, with a high ceiling, and a brightly polished lamp hanging on it, very much like the lamps our fathers used before kerosene was used, with a green shade around it, and the room is dimly lit. The lamplight is shining directly on a round table, covered with a white cloth, on which are placed various ingredients, ready for making New Year's sweet wine; in the middle of the tablecloth there are a few oil stains, slowly spreading.</p>
<p>The two old gentlemen are sitting there, half of their bodies under the dim green lamplight. They are relics of a bygone era, each trembling and collapsing there, each vaguely looking into space, their faces revealing the boredom of old age. One of them is the host, a soldier, which is obvious from his appearance. He wears a tightly fitting scarf around his neck; he has a few upturned whiskers on his upper lip, but otherwise it is clean-shaven; his eyebrows are squeezed into the angry look of a junior military officer. He is huddled in a swivel chair, his hands gripping the swivel handle, like holding a curved cane. He sits there motionless, except for his chin constantly moving up and down, making a chewing motion. The other is sitting on the sofa next to the soldier; he is a thin man, with narrow shoulders, a round head, a wide forehead, like a thinker. He casually takes a few puffs from a long pipe, the bowl almost extinguished. His face, matched with sparse curly hair, has smooth, dry skin, covered with countless tiny wrinkles, but in these wrinkles there is a soft and peaceful smile. Only an old age that has abandoned everything and returned to peace has this kind of smile.</p>
<p>The two of them sat without speaking. In this silence, you can hear the sputtering sound of the lamp oil burning, mixed with the sputtering sound of the tobacco oil in the pipe. After a while, from the darkness behind, the clock on the wall,擦的」响, struck eleven.</p>
<p>"It's almost time for you to make sweet wine," said the one with the thinker's mind. His tone was very soft, a little shaky.</p>
<p>"You simply didn't understand her," the guest grumbled. A suppressed aversion appeared on the corners of his mouth, he looked at his friend for a long time, but his expression was very gentle, very miserable, as if his soul was carrying a self-aware sin.</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, he began to speak:</p>
<p>"Hey, Franz, I want to tell you something—this thing has been gnawing at my heart like a mouse for a long time. I can't take this to the grave."</p>
<p>"Then hurry up and start," Franz said. He picked up the long pipe leaning against the swivel chair and loaded tobacco into the bowl.</p>
<p>"Once—something happened—between me and—your wife."</p>
<p>"Don't joke, Dr.先生," Franz said.</p>
<p>"I am serious, Franz. I have kept this thing in my heart for forty years, and now the time has come, I can tell this thing."</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say that my wife cheated on me?" the old soldier shouted in a rage.</p>
<p>"You are truly pitiful, Franz," the philosopher said, a sad and soft smile appearing on his face.</p>
<p>Franz muttered something and lit his pipe.</p>
<p>The philosopher continued, "You are thinking wrong; she was as pure as a true angel. You and I are the criminals. Listen to me; this is a story from forty-three years ago. At that time, you had just been ordered to Berlin as a captain, and I was teaching at the university. You know, at that time you were such a rude and absurd person."</p>
<p>"Oh," Franz said. He raised his trembling hand and twirled his mustache.</p>
<p>"At that time there was a beautiful actress,</p>
<p>"Yes, it's just the right time," the other one said. His tone was quite dry, like the rough voice of an officer giving orders.</p>
<p>The guest continued, "I never thought that without her, it would be so bleak." The host nodded, chewing in his mouth</p>
<p>"She made New Year's sweet wine for us a total of forty-four times."</p>
<p>The officer interjected, "You're right] Since we lived in Berlin, and you came to visit us."</p>
<p>The guest continued, "At this time last year, the three of us were still together, very happy. She was sitting in that armchair, knitting socks for Paul's eldest child, hurrying desperately. She said these socks had to be finished by twelve o'clock. Later, they were finished at twelve o'clock. Then we drank sweet wine and comfortably discussed the problem of death. Two months later, she really went to the grave. You know, I wrote a very important book about the immortality of ideas. At that time, you simply didn't even want to look at it. Since your wife died, I don't want to look at it either. Honestly, what ideas are not worth considering."</p>
<p>The widower said: "Yes, she was a good woman. She treated me very well. Every time I went out to work at five o'clock in the morning, she was already up, and always tried to make sure I could have a good cup of coffee before I went out. Of course, she also had her shortcomings. Whenever she was with you arguing about philosophy—　哟"!" Big black eyes, small white teeth, do you remember?"</p>
<p>"I remember! Bianca was her name." Traces of early absurdity still remained on the old man's weathered face. At this time, a faint smile appeared on his face, but it disappeared immediately. "She would bite, I tell you, she would bite!"</p>
<p>"At that time, you cheated on your wife, and your wife guessed it too. But she never said anything, just suffered in silence. You didn't notice, but I noticed. After my mother died, she was the first woman I knew well. She ran into my life like a shining star, and I looked up at her, treating her as a shining star. Finally, I plucked up the courage to ask her what was on her mind. She smiled and said she didn't feel very well. You remember, this was not long before Paul was born. Then came the eve of the New Year exactly forty-three years ago. That night at eight o'clock I arrived at your house, as usual. She was sitting embroidering; the two of us were waiting for you to come back, and I was reading to her. Time passed like this, an hour passed, and another hour. You still hadn't come back. I saw that she was feeling very uncomfortable, she started to tremble, and I trembled too. I knew what was keeping you from coming back, I was very scared in my heart, I felt that you had forgotten the twelve o'clock in that woman's arms. It was almost twelve o'clock at that time. She stopped embroidering, I stopped reciting, and there was a terrible silence. I saw a tear slowly rolling down from her eyes and falling on her embroidery. I jumped up, ready to go out and invite you home. I felt that I had the ability to pull you back from that woman's side. But just at this time, your wife also jumped up, jumping up from the seat where I am sitting now.</p>
<p>'"Where are you going?"' she said. An indescribable fear was expressed on her face.</p>
<p>'"I'm going to find Franz,"' I said.</p>
<p>'"When she heard this, she almost shouted.</p>
<p>"For God's sake, don't go away, at least you (this word was said very heavily) can be with me. You (this word was said very heavily) don't leave me."'</p>
<p>'"She then threw herself at me, put her hands on my shoulders, and hid her tearful face in my chest. My whole body trembled. No woman had ever been so close to me. But I still supported her, I talked to her, comforted her. She really needed comfort. After a while, you came back, you didn't see my flustered look. Your face was still flushed, and your eyes still showed the fatigue after indulging in drinking wildly.</p>
<p>'"On that New Year's Eve, a change arose in my heart, I was very scared. Since I felt her soft arms around my neck; since I smelled the fragrance of her hair, I felt that this shining star had fallen from the sky, felt that this was not a star, but a woman, a beautiful and breathing woman of love. I myself knew that passion was burning in my eyes; I scolded myself, cursed myself as a rogue, a liar; I then tried to separate you from your mistress, with the purpose of obtaining peace of mind. Luckily, I still had some money, which was inherited from my ancestors; I gave this money to her, she was satisfied, and then—"</p>
<p>'"Damn it,"' the old soldier interrupted, '"So it was you who did the good deed. Bianca wrote me a touching letter of farewell, saying that she had to give up my love, but her heart was already broken."'</p>
<p>'"Yes, I did this thing, I deserve your blame, but listen to me, I gave her money, hoping to exchange this money for peace of mind. But I miscalculated, and wild thoughts always swirled in my brain, getting worse and worse. I buried myself in my work. At that time, I got the central idea of my "Immortality of Ideas論". But it was useless, there was still no peace in my heart.</p>
<p>'"A whole year passed, and New Year's Eve came again. I was sitting next to her again, in this seat. That time you were at home, sleeping on the sofa in the next room, because you were tired from gambling in the club.度was sitting there, very close to her, looking at her pale face, thinking of last year's New Year's Eve in my mind, I couldn't control myself. I thought in my heart, why not kiss her head again, kiss her again, whatever happens, I don't care! The eyes of the two people are matched together. A secret understanding seemed to be revealed in her eyes. I couldn't control myself anymore. I fell at her feet and pressed my face against her knees.</p>
<p>'"I lay there motionless like this for almost two seconds. Then I felt her cold hand pressing on my head, and I heard her softly say;</p>
<p>'"You must be a good person."'</p>
<p>'"Yes, I must be a good person. The person sleeping in the next room trusts me so much, of course I can't bully him. I jumped up, looked around, and felt very sad. She then took a book from the table and handed it to me. I understood what she meant and casually opened the book and recited it. I don't know what I read. Letters danced before my eyes. But gradually, the storm in my heart calmed down. At twelve o'clock, you ran over, still sleepy, you said Happy New Year. At that time, I felt that my sin had already passed, had run far away, in the very distant past.</p>
<p>'"From that time on, I became more peaceful. I knew that she had no love for me, and I had no other intention than to hope for her sympathy. Year after year passed. Your children grew up and started families. The three of us are old. You also stopped being absurd and lived for a woman, like me. I haven't stopped loving her. No, it is impossible to stop loving her. But my love has changed its form. This love has freed itself from worldly desires and turned to spiritual harmony. You always laugh when you hear us talking about philosophy. But if you knew how our souls are fused together, you would definitely be very jealous. Now, she is dead. Maybe next New Year's Eve, we will have to follow her too. Therefore, I must take this opportunity to tell my secret, and I want to say to you: "Franz, I was sorry to you once. Please forgive me!"'"</p>
<p>He stretched out his hand, pleading to his friend, but Franz said angrily:</p>
<p>'"Enough, enough, this is nonsense! There are more to forgive! This news of yours, your confession, is too old-fashioned. I have known these things for many years. Forty years ago she told me the situation in person. Now I want to tell you why I always pursue women before I become an old man——because, when she told me this story, she said: only you are the one she has loved in her life."'</p>
<p>In the silence, his guest stared at him. The擦 on the wall響了一下,敲着</p>
<p>(Today's manuscript squeeze, "An Inch of River and Mountain, an Inch of Blood" will be suspended for one day.)</p>
<h3>Memorial Statue of an Attic Youth</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>The grand Olympic Games, held every four years in front of the shrine of Zeus, were mostly won by youths from the Peloponnese. The rise of Attic youths dates back to the sixth century BC. Anyone who won three consecutive victories could obtain such a memorial statue. As a result, sculptors in general also became interested in and needed to participate in the sports meeting; the great sculptural undertakings of Greece also made significant progress as a result.</p>
<p>This is a collection of the Acropolis Museum in Athens, originally named "Head of the Blonde." In fact, it should be called "Attic Youth" to match the history. Marble sculpture, high C, two two meters, made around 480 BC, unearthed in 1887. The craftsmanship is pure and skillful, the contours are clear, and the expression is solemn, which can be called a typical example of pure Greeks.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Women's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<p>Among the calligraphy and painting organizations in Shanghai with a long history and a solid organization, besides the Chinese Calligraphy Association, the Chinese Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association should be the most prominent. The association holds an annual calligraphy and painting exhibition. This year's art exhibition has been opened on May 2nd at the Chinese Painting Gallery on Chengdu Road. I happened to discuss contemporary calligraphy with my fellow townsman Chen Ganqing, and then we went to visit the association with great interest.</p>
<p>There were more than three hundred works in total. The famous female painters in Shanghai, except for my fellow students　Shouzhu, Sun Menglu, and the Tu Ge and Tu Shi sisters who did not participate, such as Tang Guanyu, Zhang Hongwei, Huang Zhuoqun, Li Qiujun, Wu Qingxia, Gu Qingyao, Wu Manqing, Chen Xiaocui, Bao Yahui, Zhou Lianxia, Rong Junli, Jin Qiusheng, Lei Peizhi, Zhu Erzhen, Bei Yuzhao, and dozens of others, all had masterpieces on display. Landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, and paintings of ladies filled the room, each excelling in their own strengths. Now, based on what I can remember, I will briefly express my humble opinions.</p>
<p>Ms. Tang Guanyu is a talented disciple of the contemporary master Feng Chaoran, with one ink landscape and one flower and bird painting, the former imitating Wang Huanghe, the latter learning from Lü Ji, Bian Ai, with elegant charm and scholarly air. Ms. Huang Zhuoqun's meticulous flower paintings have gained much from her teacher, the old man Hongwei's secrets, and are praised for surpassing her teacher. Qiujun's ink landscape painting is thick and solid, showing the depth of her skill. Qingxia's four reed goose paintings make people think of abandoning reeds and autumn water, and she is naturally an old hand in this field. Gu Qingyao's family learning has a long history, and this time there are many unique products, all extremely exquisite, but small paintings are more wonderful than large paintings. Wu Manqing's husband and wife painting exhibition has been well received before, and this time the large landscape imitating Shi Tao has a fresh ink atmosphere, and the brushwork is also vigorous and moving. Bao Yajun is my old classmate Shao Yun's talented disciple, and Lu Lianfu's second-generation disciple. The cloud mountain is vast and ethereal, and she has already been able to enter the hall. Xiaocui Lianzhen's paintings of ladies have a hint of Tang Qiu's style of the Ming Dynasty. Jin Qiusheng is the talented disciple of Ms. Qiujun, and she is thoughtful, studious, and has made great progress. A figure landscape painting is handsome and elegant, between Wu Xiaozhen and Chen Lao Sun. Peizhi is the wife of Lang Jingshan, and the large portrait of　Confucius has the　stone atmosphere. Zhu Erzhen's flowers are quite beautiful, and Yuan　Shu's calligraphy is extremely thick, all of which are masterpieces.</p>
<p>Bei Yuzhao initially studied with Wu Chang, and later studied Lake　, a landscape painting of松雲飛瀑 is almost indistinguishable from the real Lake scenery. Pang Zuoyu's flower paintings, with vigorous and beautiful brushwork and colors, are also the highlight of this art exhibition. Chen Sidong's landscape, the tree method and stone method, seems to be like my teacher Xiao Wuquan's brushwork, other famous painters, Wu Peipei, Yu Mijingyun, Mu Zhen, and Mu Juan's flower paintings, double hook coloring, have a great Yuan style, meaning Kai is all female disciples of Daqian. I passed by in a hurry, and there were many　遺　, and what I discussed, Ganqing said that what he saw was roughly the same.</p>
<h3>Rambling Talks While Alone</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>As the car sped along the road, Hai Tong pointed to the neon lights beside the road and said sadly;</p>
<p>"That red is the blood of the toiling people, that white is sweat."</p>
<p>"No, that green color is sweat," I said. A moment of silence.</p>
<p>Obviously, my brother had understood what I meant.</p>
<p>Because I thought of the hard work on the broad green plain. I also thought of faces that were reflected into a pale green.</p>
<p>"The more prosperous the city, the poorer the countryside. How many people in this city have contributed anything to the vast crowds? And how many rural areas are needed to maintain the city's huge buildings?"</p>
<p>I love Hai Tong's unconventionality, but this is just his innocent babbling. So I said;</p>
<p>"In theory, your words cannot be established. Because you only pointed out a superficial phenomenon based on intuition.</p>
<p>"You must know that when a person is dying, in a very short time, their face will look particularly good, which is called "迴光返照", but this is not a healthy color."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I couldn't bear to burden my thoughtful brother with my sorrow. But I am willing to record this passage and ask my dear readers to think about it! When a person is sick, do we look for a doctor? Or do we save some legal tender and simply buy a beautiful "coffin"? (I wonder if the ancients added the wood radical to the word "coffin"?)</p>
<p>Two or three years ago, Zugong told me that he was going to write a play called "The Legend of Catching Ghosts". (According to this play has been staged in Shanghai, but the author missed the Zhu Guan due to busy work.) Then he talked about the plot. The last paragraph, which I still find very thought-provoking, said:</p>
<p>"Zhong Jinshi was drunk by five ghosts and fell asleep. When he woke up, it was the 20th century. Zhong Jinshi's tools and methods of catching ghosts could not keep up with the times, so he was beaten by the ghosts, so it became the world now."</p>
<p>This ending (I don't know if this play was later changed due to various considerations?) is full of the meaning of reality. The beauty of comedy lies in crying in laughter.</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>What is "Untouchability"?</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>The "Untouchability" (Uhtouckability, literally translated as unapproachable custom), which Gandhi has always regarded as a major stain on Hinduism, has recently been abolished by the Indian Constituent Assembly. We, who are concerned about India's prosperity and free independence, hear the Indian people blowing the horn of social reform, how can we not be extremely pleased.</p>
<p>We　know that Indian society is complex and strange, and the boundaries of social classes are strict. People of different classes never marry or associate. In addition to the four kinds of class distinctions we are familiar with: monks, nobles, farmers, workers, and slaves, there are also various different classes distinguished by occupation, and there are as many as two or three thousand kinds of detailed classifications.</p>
<p>These artificial class distinctions have made Indian society fragmented. Moreover, all artificial inequalities hinder India's development and progress.</p>
<p>The most miserable class is the "Untouchable Class" (Untoucnables). The so-called Untouchability is the attitude of ordinary people towards people of the Untouchable Class. In the eyes of people of other classes, the nature of people of the Untouchable Class is lowly and filthy. Superior people must not only never come into contact with them, but also their shadows must not be touched, and even their traces must not be seen, so as not to defile the eyes of superior people.</p>
<p>As a result, the more than 40 million people in India belonging to the "Untouchable Class" have been absolutely discriminated against by the ideology of untouchability. They are confined to living in special areas, cannot participate in all activities of superior people, many public roads cannot be taken, and they have to avoid superior people on the road. In short, they live an inhuman life, a life worse than cattle and horses.</p>
<p>Obviously, if India wants to revive, it must break the distinction between social classes, and the abolition of Untouchability is even more urgent. Now, we are about to see one-seventh of the Indian population, because of the abolition of Untouchability, has obtained the guarantee of basic human rights, we really want to congratulate India's future.</p>

<h3>Fighting Fish</h3>
<p>— Bai Gao</p>
<p>The Siamese fighting fish (Betta pugnax) of Thailand are inherently aggressive, always prepared to fight and kill males of their own species. These fish, when kept in aquariums, need to be separated to prevent them from gathering together. The Siamese fighting fish is a small, clear-water fish, similar to the Chinese Paradise fish, only as long as a human finger. However, their combat is surprisingly fierce, piquing the interest and gambling desires of the Thai people. At one point, some Thais even bankrupted themselves due to gambling on fighting fish, and some even wagered their freedom, losing it in the process.</p>
<p>Therefore, excellent fighting fish are very valuable, and their breeding requires extreme care. Male fighting fish are often fed mosquito larvae, which is similar to wheat in nourishing the fish. These fish are extremely good at nurturing their offspring, covering their nests with a barrier made from their own saliva, providing strict protection.</p>
<p>There are two common methods of judging fighting fish in Thailand. The first is a refined, aesthetic approach. Two fish are placed in separate glass tanks, positioned side by side so they can see each other through the glass. The fish's color is usually yellow-gray, but after the tanks are placed together, a gradual change occurs. When they detect the presence of an enemy, they gradually flare up, and the color changes from yellow-gray and brown to a gorgeous purple, with the entire body displaying vivid colors. Then, the gill covers flare, like unfurled sails, and the fin membrane expands, colored blood-red. They attack each other, only to be stopped by the glass partition. This is a color contest, with the most beautiful color being the victor.</p>
<p>If two fish are placed in the same tank, the winner is not decided by color, but by the sharpness of their teeth. They need to fight to the death before stopping. When they first encounter each other, their bodies are full of vibrant colors, and they circle and chase each other. Then, they suddenly charge, causing scales to break off, teeth to be damaged, and eyeballs to be pulled out of their sockets. The first to sink to the bottom of the tank loses. The loser's sides will show two long, prominent black streaks, resembling mournful thoughts of pain. However, the victor often does not allow the defeated to survive, continuing the pursuit until both are wounded.</p>
<p>Public fighting fish arenas have long existed in Thailand. Those engaged in this business need to hold a license, and the privilege of issuing licenses belongs to the King personally. The history of these arenas is at least one hundred years old.</p>
<h3>Talking about Puns and Wordplay</h3>
<p>— Chaoyang</p>
<p>Chinese characters are mostly pictographic and ideographic, but the pun, which uses phonetic similarity, often produces unexpected results. Using puns in anecdotes or storytelling is relatively easy, but using them in couplets is more challenging. Yesterday, a friend recited a couplet: "A boy strikes a tung tree, the tung fruit doesn't fall, the boy is not happy; a maiden eats hemp cakes, the hemp cakes are truly fresh, the maiden is truly immortal." I think this is vernacular. If classical Chinese is used and ancient names are embedded, it shows even more ingenuity, truly achieving effortless perfection, erasing all traces of labor. For example, in the couplet "Two boats sailing together, Lu Su's oars are not as fast as Fan Kuai's sail; eight instruments playing in turn, Di Qing's flute is hard to compare to Xiao He's xiao flute," one can say that the writing is born of nature, a lucky coincidence. This is like the wordplay "frozen rain sprinkles the window, east two dots, west three dots; cutting cake for guests, top seven cuts, bottom eight cuts," picked up at random, all becoming wonderful creations. The minds of scholars are truly like mercury spilled on the ground, penetrating everywhere. Perhaps when the sage created the characters, he had already reserved this kind of distribution to test the skills of those who create couplets?</p>
<h3>Art and Literary Circles</h3>
<p>The National Shanghai Conservatory of Music will hold its fourth student concert at 7:30 PM on the 1st (Thursday) of this month in the school's auditorium in the city center. There are many programs, totaling nineteen vocal and instrumental pieces, including a string trio, violin solo, cello solo, piano solo, and soprano and tenor solos, baritone solo, and mixed quartet, etc. The performance results are quite good, and a few students' works (a violin solo by Wu and a string piece) will also be included.</p>
<p>The "Free Talk" monthly magazine of the Literary Society is about to be published, edited by Lü Baihua. It features Zi Kai's cartoons, Xie Bingying's correspondence, and essays by Shi Zhicun, Dai Wangshu, Wei Jinzhi, Zhao Jingshen, Lu Danlin, etc., and short stories by Zhao Qingge, Hu Shanyuan, Chen Bochui, etc. The content is rich and pure, a good reading material for young people.</p>
<p>Bao Yahui, wife of Pan Xulun, has been practicing landscape painting for thirty years with profound skill. Recently, many of her works were exhibited in the Women's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition, attracting the attention of the audience, and many buyers were eager to purchase them.</p>
<h3>"Reading Behind Closed Doors"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yin</p>
<p>Probably due to the stimulation of the democratic trend, student movements in recent years seem to be more active, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. However, some people disapprove, saying that students' responsibility is to study, and that matters outside of studying are not worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Those who say these words undoubtedly have very "pedantic" minds. The era of locking students in schools, making them hold books and recite "zhī hū zhě yě" or "ABCD" is long gone. Here, I do not want to bring out the grand banner of "reading without forgetting nation-building," but letting passionate young people could not help but shout a few words, is not entirely reprehensible, right?</p>
<p>In the Records of Ming Scholars, it says: "Gu Jincheng, whose courtesy name was Jishi, also known as Jingfan, was the brother of Mr. Jingyang. One day, he sighed deeply. Jingyang asked, 'Why do you sigh?' He said, 'I sigh at the scholars of today, who, even if the sky is falling and the earth is collapsing, do not care and only focus on lecturing!'... Jingyang was moved by this."</p>
<p>These two old men lived in the Ming Dynasty hundreds of years ago and still had such insights. If, in the increasingly civilized modern era, someone still advocates "reading behind closed doors," wouldn't they be looked down upon by the ancients?</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Danger</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>But in the afternoon, he experienced the bitterness of being too familiar with and not understanding the general bureaucratic atmosphere of Chinese government offices. He arrived at the First Section, and Section Chief Yu came out to meet him, but office work requires procedures!</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Zhu, this won't work!" After Lao Zhu excitedly explained his intentions and his previous contacts with Director Xiong, the gloomy section chief said coldly in his thick Guangxi-accented Mandarin, "Director Xiong hasn't approved it, we won't connect!"</p>
<p>"Didn't he mention it to you?"</p>
<p>"Even if he did, it's useless!" Section Chief Yu still shook his head. "We always have to see the official document before we can handle things!"</p>
<p>Lao Zhu knew that arguing with him was useless, so he returned to the director's office to find Director Xiong again. But Director Xiong was not so free. He hadn't arrived by 2:45 PM, and finally came at 3:30 PM. However, so many guests, so many phone calls, and so many so-called "official matters" had formed a wall of copper and iron around him, making it impossible for Lao Zhu to get close to him. Finally, he did manage to see him, but Director Xiong, who had been busy all day, had mostly forgotten about the matter. Lao Zhu had to be polite first, then stare at him, then complain, acting out a set of actions like in a play. Only then did the great director pick up his pen and write a few ambiguous words on the letter of introduction that Lao Zhu had brought, as an approval for Section Chief Yu of the First Section.</p>
<p>Lao Zhu held this precious letter and jumped straight to the First Section.</p>
<p>"How many of you are going together?" The bureaucratic Section Chief Yu read the letter four or five times and suddenly raised this question. (64)</p>
