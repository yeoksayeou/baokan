<h3>接收旅大屢遭阻撓　我向蘇方提出照會　外部發表公報詳述經過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕我政府頃就接收旅大　被阻撓事，向蘇方提出照會一件，（照會要點見外交部公報末段）已於廿五日晨由王外長　交蘇使館代辦費德林。</p>
<p>〔中外社南京廿五日電〕蘇大使館代　費德林參事，廿五日晨訪王外長世杰，稍談後即行辭出。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕關於旅大接收問題之經過，外交部二十五日發表公報如左：</p>
<p>（一）中國政府自日本投降後，於一九四五年十月，着接手收哀北之際，即決定派遣若干軍隊，在大連登陸，首先接收旅大行政，詎蘇　政府藉口大連為一自由商港，堅法反對中國政府派兵在大連登陸，因此中國政府依約接收旅大行政之第一步即遭受阻得。查一九四五年八月中蘇友好同盟條約，規定大連爲一自由商港，其意義係指過境貨物得免除過境稅，與中國軍隊之入駐大連無關，大連主權及行政之屬於中國，曾經該約明白規定。中國行政廢除經條約明定者外，自不受任何其他限制。該約並無限制中國軍隊入駐大連之任何明文，故中國政府派兵由大連登陸，決不違反中蘇條約。外交部當時曾根據上項理由，對蘇方之見解予以嚴正之駁復。</p>
<p>（二）當時因蘇方之阻抗，中國軍隊未能入駐大連，旅大行政之接收遂無法進行，因當時旅大尙均在蘇軍佔領中。自蘇方拒絕中國政府軍隊出大連登陸後，中國共產黨之武力，乃在旅大附近迅速發展，此種武力之存在與發展，使得中國政府自陸地上接收旅大亦受重大阻障。</p>
<p>（三）本年三月，蘇　曾表示希望中國政府在旅大建立其行政權，中國政府常經劃　聲明，謂中國政府所以未能接收旅大，其原因為以上所述之兩種阻碍。</p>
<p>（四）最近三個月來，外交部關於接收旅大事，曾與蘇方多次交交涉。蘇方聲明在大連及旅順海軍根據據地全部區域內無任何反中國政府之武力存在。蘇方保證由國政府　往旅大行政人員之安全，並使其能自由行使職權。中國政府派往旅順之武裝警寫數日及其駐紥地點，應由雙方就地商定。至於中國政府決定派遣軍隊進駐旅順海軍根據　區事，因依照　蘇條約，該海軍根據地之防護，已由中國政府委託蘇聯政府辦理，故蘇聯政府表示不能同意。</p>
<h3>我派軍進駐旅大　中蘇條約未限制</h3>
<p>又關於中國之軍警進駐大連事，蘇方藉口以當時對日戰爭狀態尙未結束，依照中蘇條約火連仍應受旅順海軍根據地區域之軍事管制。因此蘇聯政府認爲中國軍隊現在不能進入火連，中國只可派警察赴旅順大連，且須由中蘇雙方協定其數量與駐紥地點。外交部以依照中蘇條約中關於旅順口之協定，旅順海軍根據地全部區域均爲中蘇「共同使用」之地區，認爲中國當然有權派軍隊入駐旅順軍區，故對蘇方認爲中國軍隊不能入駐旅順之解釋，表示不能同意。至於中國車隊進駐大連事，依照中蘇條約在「對日作戰」時，大連圖受旅順軍區之管制，但日本投降已一年有餘，所謂「對日作戰」之事實，實際上已不存在，且即在「對日作戰」時，中蘇條約亦無限制中國軍隊進入大連之條文。旅順軍區為大連之管制，在「對日作戰」時，亦應僅以適應中蘇共同對日作戰之需要爲限。我國軍隊警察進駐大連，以維護其行政之安全，即在「對日作戰」時，當亦不能視爲與共同對日作戰之需要有何妨　，故外交部對於蘇方之見解，曾迭次以書面嚴正表示不能同意，並要求蘇方對於中國派遣軍隊入駐旅大之決定，能充分諒解，蓋在現時情況之下，旅大區域隨時可受反抗政府之武力威脅或襲擊，中國政府爲確保行政人員之安全與自由，在條約上固有派遣軍隊之權，在實際上亦有此需要也，但蘇方仍不表示同意。</p>
<p>（五）我政政乃一面與蘇方繼續交涉，一面派董彥　等赴旅大視察地方情形，以爲依復旅大行政權之進備。關於派員視察一事，我方曾於事先商得蘇方之同意，蘇方並表示對董彥平等之視察，應予以充分之協助，使其能自由執行視察之任務。但董等抵旅順後，因未能獲得蘇方預允給予之協助，兼受當地所謂地方行政機構之阻撓，其視察任務，遂未能達成。此一視察之結果，尤足證明：如無足量之中國軍警入駐旅大，中國行政人員將無法行使其職權。</p>
<h3>接收旅大行政權　我方可隨時實行</h3>
<p>（六）總之，旅大行政，至今未能由中國政府接收：（一）由於蘇聯政府一再拒絕中國政府軍隊入駐旅大，（二）由於自蘇方拒絕中國政府軍隊由大連登陸後，中國共產黨在旅大附近成立甚大之武力，以阻撓中國政府之接收。中國政府於此不能不鄭車喚起蘇聯政府到於中蘇條約內次列兩項條文所規定之基本義務，特予注意：1「蘇聯政府同意予中國以道義上與軍需品及其他物資之援助。此項援助，當完全供給中國中央政府，到國民政府」。2「蘇聯政府以東三省為中國之一部份，對中國在東三省之充分主權，重申尊車，並對其領土與行政之完整，重申承認」。中國政府深望蘇聯政府顧念其上述之義務，對於條約中無明白規定之事，不曲加解擇，以破壞中國主權與行政之完整，阻撓旅大行政之接收。中國政府願本友好精神，繼續交涉，以來取彼此見解之一致。同時中國應鄭重聲明，中國政府派遣軍警接收旅大行政之權，旣無條約限制，中國政府自得隨時決定行使全權也。</p>
<h3>徐傳霖抵滬　談京中動態</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕徐傅蘇昨晨自承抵滬，接見記者稱：「在京參加國務會議時，會中頗多主張討伐共　者，但尙未有所決定。在現狀下，本人認為改革政治收拾人心，其作用或更爲有效。關於普選事，則蔣主席·吳文官長等，均表示決不延期舉行，惟籌備工作之進行，不甚緊張。比例選舉事迄未商定，若干方面亦有主張自由競選者。」又民社黨定今日午後三時舉行中常會，商討進行大選事宜，並討論伍憲子再度調停之建議。</p>
<h3>宋子文抵京　晉謁蔣主席</h3>
<p>〔外報南京廿五日電〕國府委員宋子文，二十五日上午十一時半由滬乘中航機抵京，同來者省隨員四人。下機後，宋氏即赴官邸晉謁蔣主席，並在官邸午餐，主席曾對宋氏有所垂詢。</p>

<h3>中蘇條約迄未實施　引起一般不安　董顯光在記者會上談話</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕行政院新聞局於廿五日下午舉行記者招待會，董同長答復詢問如后：</p>
<p>問，孫副主席前日接見中央日報記者，關於中蘇關係，主張中國政府應向蘇聯政府提出抗議。孫副主席並稱，彼以爲政府業已考慮此項步驟，董局長能代表政府立塲加以申　否！</p>
<p>問，孫副主席最近對中美報界之談話，是否代表政府意見。</p>
<p>問，孫副主席之聲明，是否足以證明中蘇關係，已至萬分惡劣</p>
<p>答，本人不能代表孫副主席發言，惟孫副主席對蘇向極友好，並熱烈主張中蘇兩國應建立密切友誼，此為全國所週知者。中國八年餘之抗戰，收復哀北各省，亦爲其主要目的，中國爲恢復東北各省之主權，且爲遠東奠定永久和平之然礎起見，於日本宣佈無條件投降之後，即與蘇聯締訂友好同盟條約，此約訂結迄今已歷一年又十一個月，尙米見實施，因此造成一般不安及懷疑之情態。孫副主席對此嚴軍後果之表示其憂慮，自在意中。</p>
<h3>發行五萬元大鈔　董局長稱無所聞</h3>
<p>問，昨日滬報曾載，政府將發行五萬元票面之大鈔，不知董局長有所聞否？</p>
<p>答，對此專尙未聽到，想政府不至發行此項大鈔。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕傳政府將下討伐令，廿五日午後記者招待會上，某記者以此相詢，董局長答「本人未有所聞」。</p>
<h3>新聞局闢室　供記者娛樂</h3>
<p>〔中央南京廿十五日電〕政院新聞局長董顯光，為與新聞界謀取更密切之聯繫，頃已慨允記者等之要求，將該局平日新聞會議用之小室，撥充記者，作經常俱樂之塲所。</p>
<h3>林蔚與黃鎭球　兩人互調職務</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕國防部頃發表：該部次長林蔚將軍，參謀次長冀鎭球將軍職務互調，聞兩氏將於日內分別就任新職。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕國防部長白崇禧，定廿六日午宴交長俞大維經長陳啓天教長宋家驊總長陳誠及陸海空聯勤各總司令幷邀林蔚秦德純等作陪。</p>
<h3>人口統計公布辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕內政部人口局對於全國人口統計及其公布時期，已訂定辦法，即每年一月及七月，分別公布半年之統計，在此半年中，人口數不予變更</p>
<h3>對我新疆事件抗議　外蒙覆文已送達　內容亦與蘇方廣播相同</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕外蒙對我關於新疆事件抗議之覆文，已送抵我外部，聞內容亦與塔斯社所廣播者大體相同。</p>
<p>〔又電〕關係方面息，我外部正縝密研究蘇方新疆事件所提覆文，並將作第二次抗議。聞抗議書已擬就，俟決定後即提出。</p>
<h3>某國際局勢觀察家談　美援軍不成問題　孫科談話僅為個人意見</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕此間某研究國際局勢之觀察家，認爲孫科氏兩次對中外記者之談話，其所以爲一般人重視，乃以孫氏爲國府副主席之地位，但在國民黨及國民政府，尙未表示決策以前，孫氏談話僅能視爲渠個人意見。渠稱關於東北戰局，共軍雖有國際背景，但國府軍事當局自信必能確保據點，新疆北塔山事件，亦無新發展，可見中國共產黨問題，蘇聯未必即於此時露面捲人議渦。關於美援蕪支符國民政府本不成問題，僅盼中國政府自身有確定方針，對貸款使用及償還方法有具體計劃，我當可與美國商定撥款時期，無所謂放棄中國，故中國政府如何整飭政治，安定民生，制止戰亂，乃中國自身問題，不必以美國貸款之遲早爲考慮條件。</p>
<h3>顧大使與美商談　傳包括兩點內容　撥付貸款及其他援助</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿五日廣播：關於美國對外經濟援助事，馬歇爾所發表之談話僅謂國務院刻正考慮美國會及美國納稅人所認爲正當之可能的援助計劃。但擄權威方面談稱，美當局與顧維鈞大使商談之建議包括兩點：（一）指定在六月三十日以前貸與中國之進出口銀行借款，立即撥借，或從他方面予以援助。（二）建設鐵路及工業之長期計劃，由美國以借款資助，凑足十億元。除顧大使謂國務院甚表同情外，別無其他決定。顧大使吿記者謂，渠希望六月三十日之限期能獲延長云。</p>
<h3>美議員呼籲援華　主募款援助中國</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿四日電〕共和黨議員兼衆院外委會委員裘特，近吿援華聯合會華盛頓分會稱，美國爲道義上，人道上與法理上之理由，必須援助中國人民，蓋在過去二度戰爭中，中國皆美國之盟邦，理應獲得美國之扶助。</p>
<p>裘氏繼稱，美國人民不應停止援助中國入民之工作。渠幷指出，從朋友立塲捐集款項直接嘉惠中國人　，與通過政府主持之借款，　予援助，絕非毫無區別。</p>
<p>援華聯合會站在不分黨派之立塲上，　　得款額分配中國若干機構，俾訓練公共衛生，福利，醫藥，社曾工作各方面之領導人才。華盛頓分會攤派之經募款額為八萬美元。該會現擬金起特別捐贈運動，將不足之數，全部補足，按全國經募目標爲八百萬美</p>

<h3>下屆大會定十一月間舉行　各國代表今晚晉京主席</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聯合國亞洲暨遠東經濟委員會，於本月十六日起在華戀飯店舉行首次會議，歷時九日，業於昨日下午一時二十分正式閉幕。委員會昨日討論最後一項議題，乃下屆會議之日期與地點。當時曾經過一番爭執，結果決定下屆會議在十一月下半月內舉行，確實日期則由秘書處規定。至開會地點，因意見分歧，決定移至該會全體委員會七月十日在紐約舉行會議是商決</p>
<p>按此次會議目的，旨在計劃及組織一聯合國亞洲及遠東之經濟機構，以備實行協助亞洲及遠東戰後之經濟重建與蓋舉，成功湖第二次會議，將討論此次大會之提案，並將此項提案，送呈聯合國經濟委會。</p>
<p>此次大會參加代表計有中·美·法·英·蘇·印·荷·澳·　·菲等十國，並有各國經濟專家與會，國為亞洲前所未有之國際大會，而各國代表在滬十日之返留，所費亦至驚人，單就　昆酒會一項言，當在數億元以上，全體代表以大會已告結束，已定於今晚聯袂赴京晉　蔣主席及訪拜有關當局，中菲代表並將赴國父陵寢獻花致敬。</p>
<h3>下屆大會日期地點　討論時之輕鬆爭辯</h3>
<p>昨日大會討論下屆會議日期時，聯合國機構秘書長沃文建議在十一月下旬舉行，俾秘書處有充裕時間完成委員會交辦之繁重工作，並可使委員會本身有充裕時間準備報告，向經濟社會理事會提出。蘇代表史迭辛柯建議在十二月一日左右召開，法代表摩爾諾則建議在十一月十七日，最後即通過在十一月下半月內舉行。</p>
<p>至會議地點問題被提出後，遷，菲，中，印各國代表均代表各該國政府邀請在各該國內舉行，且皆保證可使參加之代表獲各種方便。菲代表瓜德諾並強調謂：菲島氣候良好，交通亦便利。</p>
<p>中美代表妙喻</p>
<p>中國代表李　，喻此開會地點似一出風頭之青年，大家均想拉攏。中國政府亦希望下屆會議再中國舉行，各位代表此次來滬，如覺各方面供應及交通皆便利者，則下屆會議歡迎各位仍在東方大都市之上海開會，且議事規則中第二條說明會議地點在聯合國機構辦事處舉行，同時經濟社會理事會會決議在外久辦事處未決定前，暫設在上海，則上海富可為下屆會議地點。</p>
<p>蘇代表主張在印度召開。</p>
<p>此問題正相持不下之時，英代表克羅建議移交全體委員會在紐約成功湖舉行時再行討論。英，澳，法，三國代表均贊同，戴維斯且更改李　氏之　喻曰：會議地點非似出風頭之青年，而似出風頭之少女，被一羣追求者所爭奪。各位熱誠歡迎，實甚感激，但不如在紐約會議時討論較為相宜。</p>
<p>然蘇代表則竭力反對，渠謂：蘇代表將不參加紐約之全體委員會，故堅持須再現會議中決定。</p>
<p>最後付諸表决，以九對一（蘇聯）票通過在紐約會中討論。</p>
<p>至委員會之臨時總部，且　暫定設於上海。</p>
<p>又主席蔣廷敬以前日大會通過之決議案未經正式手續通過，補行提出。蘇代表表示此項決議案未能使蘇代表團滿意，故放棄表决，而其他代表則認為決議案本不能使全體代表完全滿意，故贊成正式通過。</p>
<p>感謝主席秘書</p>
<p>經委會首次會議閉幕前，英代表可羅，特先對主席蔣廷　之領導此會議，秘書處在短時期內之優良工作，中國政府之熱誠招待及一切供應，表示感謝。</p>
<p>蔣氏則回謝各代表合作之精神與週到之顧慮。並稱：中國政府極頗為各代表供應一切。沃文氏則代表全體秘書處人員感謝代表對其工作之讚揚，並申述該處人員較任何類似此種會議之職員者為少，同時時間局促，致多不週。此外，又感謝中國政府給與之種種便利。</p>
<h3>聯總駐華分署　籲請國共雙方　停止軍事行動　加緊黃河復堤</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕聯總駐華分署頃請求中國國共雙方，在全部黃河河床及河堤兩旁五英里內，立即停止任何軍事行動，俾復堤工作得再七月底前依最高速度進行。聯總駐華分署署長克利扶蘭發出上述呼籲時，並警告雙方如不以「高度之政治家作風自維，則七月間之洪水將決堤一處或多處，不僅魯蘇冀省數百萬農民將大受災禍，即復堤工作已完成部份，亦將全部毀滅。克氏建議於花園口以下整個黃河兩岸停止一切軍事行動，俾最低限度之復堤工作，得以完成。據云：即使雙方發出該項命令，而通力合作復堤，本年洪凡尙有來臨之可能，倘停止軍事行動之命令不發，則聯總將無法協助担任必要之修堤工作。上項建議係由克氏親自面交參謀總長陳誠及行政院長張羣，同時電致聯總華北辦公處，轉遞共方最高當局」。</p>
<h3>黃河大汛將臨　魯豫趕修提防</h3>
<p>〔中央社鄭州廿五日電〕黃河大汛，一月後即至，故復堤工程益為迫切，現政府，中共，聯總三方面，已成立一聯合委員會，專事處理魯境內環境較為複雜地區工程。聯總顧問塔德，頃由此赴曹縣，參加該委會首次會議。目前豫境內復堤工作，除孟縣方面因有共軍竄。施工較為困難外，其他地區僅需充足材料，即可按時完成，武　境內之　河，　與黃河銜接，亦須同參加以堵修，惟該河南岸為共軍控制，故亦不易施工，此間豫修防處對共軍妨礙施工地區所發生之問題，擬堤請聯合委員會設法解決。</p>

<h3>修正遺產稅法　政務會將討論</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕修正遺產稅法草案，業經主管方面擬定，政務會議將予以討論並通過，再送立法院完成立法程序。按遺產稅法係去歲四月十六日公佈並施行，根據該法規定，遺產總額在百萬以上者，即須納稅，稅率採按級　進制，百萬以上者征百分之二，二百萬以上者征百分之二，依次上推，至萬萬以上者，征百之六十，是為最高稅率。該法自施行以來，由於通貨貶值，原定之遲稅點百萬元已失之過低，而一萬萬以上征百之六十，又未免太高，此次修正之起稅點提高為三千萬，稅率由百分之一起，仍採　進制，最高額改為百分之三十，以求公平與合理。</p>

<p>梅氏談話</p>
<p>梅氏接見記者時稱：遠東軍事法庭決定自六月廿七日起，休庭六星期，至八月四日為止。此舉乃應全體被告律師之請求，俾在此休庭之時間內，作充分之準備。在另一方面，遠東國際軍事法庭已繼續不斷開庭十四個月，世界任何法庭從無如此長期開庭者，一切工作人員均應疲倦，亦可乘休庭之便，略作休息。本人向立法院告假已在一年半以上，今立院改組在即，亦需返國一航，擬於兩三日內晉京報告。吳向二位檢察官如時間交通情形許可，將赴西南調查戰犯罪證。梅氏繼稱：外界對遠東軍事法庭之審判戰犯，因遲遲不決而感覺不耐，此亦情理之常。在審判過程中，各方面牽連之質，證據收集之難，有若干出於法官意想之外，整個日本武力侵略歷史，拉長至十年之久，更使審判情形，趨於複雜。離東京前，曾由法庭全體法官邀請全體被告律師，商討如何加速進行，庭長且表示希望審判工作能於今年年底結束。但是能否如願，尚不可知。又梅氏等一行定七月底返日。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕澳大利亞駐華公使柯伯倫博士，昨日午後四時半招待記者，就盟軍管制日本政策發表意見，謂：澳洲與中國現均恐慌麥帥之管制政策，將造成過於強大之日本。八月二十六日英帝國在澳洲召開帝國會議，對於日本和約將作縝密商討。日本之在南極捕鯨（關於此事之消息，請參第三版），與預定八月中開放日本私人貿易，均為麥帥繳部所片面決定者。日本賠償之執行，應為對日和約中之一部份，而不應由佔領軍當局決定。澳使論及中澳間之商務，謂目前之不振原因有二：一為澳洲現時本身需要大，無貨出售，二則為受中國進口管制之影響。惟澳洲之工業在戰時發展甚速，尤以鋼鐵工業，因地理環境及管理技術之優良，已能出產全球最便宜之鋼，將來羊毛織品及鋼製品，當能大量出口。中澳移民問題，亦可在互惠原則下解決。</p>

<h3>聯合國憲章誕生兩周年</h3>
<p>今天是聯合國憲章在舊金山簽字的兩周年紀念日，在我們紀念這一件歷史文件簽字的今日，聯合國亞洲及遠東經濟委員會在上海所召開的會議還在進行。我們回憶當時聯合國憲章在舊金山簽字，正值納粹崩潰，加緊對日作戰的時候，此一憲章的誕生，使全世界的人類，在飽經了戰爭的苦難以後，產生了一種對世界和平的美麗遠景。對日的戰爭，那時還沒有完；而一個新的世界組織會却已在戰爭的霧圍中產生了。全人類將他們的希望寄予這個新的機構。他們曉得過去國際組織之失敗，便在於先天的不足。國際聯盟的產生與巴黎和會同時，使它與和約不可分離，因而遭遇了它的厄運。聯合國憲章在戰爭的苦難中產生，它表示全世界人民的一種覺醒，就是：人類必須在國際合作中繼續能生存，國際社會的秩序，必須維持，而此項秩序的維持，必須求之於一個堅強的國際組織。兩年前的今日，各國代表在舊金山簽署此一歷史文件的時候，當時，一般人民的情緒是高極了，他們相信，因為有了這一機構，此後國際社會的秩序必能確保，然而這兩年來所演變的事實，却又不免使當年情緒高的人感到一陣暗　。如今對日作戰的停止，已將近兩年了，而現在的國際秩序却還不曾趨於安定。茲當聯合國憲章在舊金山簽字的兩周年，誠不免令我們感觸多端。</p>
<p>聯合國機構的產生，在一個較國際聯盟的產生，更適宜的條件下。兩年來國際局勢的未能安定是事實，但此與聯合國機構本身，不一定有什麽關連。聯合國機構本身，兩年來却有不斷地發展，內部的組織，亦已日趨健全。如今聯合國亞洲及遠東經濟委員會之在上海召開會議，就足以表現聯合國本身的天天在滋長發育。過去兩年來，在聯合國組織各項會議席上，聚各國的代表於一堂，相互交換意見，雖在若干主要問題上，未必即能成立協議：然而能夠有這種機會來陳述各方的意見，這本身已經是可喜的事了。世人以為聯合國安全理事會國否決權的運用，將使聯合國機構，變成一種極無能力的組織；但我們覺得聯合國機構的有無能力，不在否決權的規定，而在否決權的如何運用。就憲章，否決規定來作理論上的解釋，我們覺得有此規定，未必為害：問題就在實際上的運用如何。而實際上的如何運用，此又與聯合國機構本身無關，非聯合國機構本身所能控制。從組織上講，聯合國機構，實在可以說是一個理想的國際組織。它在過去兩年間所表現的之未免使一部人士感到失望，這原因要在聯合國機構外求之。</p>
<p>這主要的原因是什麽：便是世人對於聯合國濫用，聯合國機構未始不可以發揮它的權能。而否決權的濫用，就是對聯合國機構未能給予以應有的愛護之表徵。假如對這一機構愛護，必使它能夠順利發育，充分發揮它應有的權能。否決權的濫用，因之，便具有摧殘的意義。然而問題的核心還是在對聯合國這一機構缺乏信念；必對於此一機構有信念，然後始能有愛護。聯合國這機構是被創造出來的東西，創造之者必對於他們所創造的東西有信念，有愛護，然後被創造的　能滋長發育。聯合國機構所遭到的不是先天的不是，而是缺乏愛護，缺乏對於它的信念。今天我們紀念聯合國憲章在舊金山簽字的兩周年，我們特別要提出這一點；我們要愛護這一機構，加強對於這一機構的信念。講到對於此一機構的信念，我們猶憶當時出席舊金山會議的我國代表曾提出中國為了加強此一國際組織，準備放棄一部份主權，可見我們對於此一機構愛護之深。假如各國對於此一機構能有像我們這樣的愛護，聯合國機構便可發揮出它的權力。</p>
<p>我們倘使再追問下去，便可知對聯合國機構能協調，國際合作云云，突然祗成了一種外交辭令。國際間之未能協調，主要便在於猜忌，在於疑慮。我們必須廓清那些足以引起猜忌疑慮的事態，必須有一種對於武力及霜術的覺醒，萬能化猜忌為和諧，變疑慮為協調。納粹是失敗了，日本軍閥是失敗了；然而今天卻還有人想循他們的途徑，建立世界統治。出現在世界各處的不安，這就是一個直接的原因。我們必須肅清這種統治世界的霸道主義，然後　能有真正的國際合作。所謂否決權的濫用，其出發點也就在此。必國際間能有充分的合作，然後像聯合國這種國際組織，　能發揮它的力量。茲當聯合國憲章在舊金山簽字的兩周年，我們呼籲國際間更需要緊密的合作。</p>

<h3>聯合國憲章簽字兩週年　四強領袖今日廣播　史達林拒絕參加理由不明</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖廿四日電〕史達林元帥業已拒絕應邀於六月廿六日聯合國憲章簽字紀念日，參加他國領袖之廣播節目，聯合國電台與美國廣播公司約定，將於是日撥定半小時之時間，廣播中國蔣主席·美國杜魯門總統·英國艾德禮首相·法國賴　迪總理·比利時史巴克總理及聯合國秘書長賴依之談話。史達林之拒絕參加，並未說明理由。</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖廿四日合衆電〕聯合國宣佈：美國務卿馬歇爾將於廿六日非正式訪問聯合國總部，參加聯合國憲章簽訂二週年典禮。美政府與聯合國官員均鄭重表示，馬卿首次蒞臨聯合國，「絕無特別任務」。同時又據宣佈，史達林已通知聯合國，渠將不參加其他四強領袖發表廣播，以慶賀聯合國憲章簽訂二週年紀念，該通知係由蘇外次葛羅米柯　交聯合國。美總統杜魯門，英首相艾德禮，蔣主席及法總理賴　迪於接獲史達林拒絕發表廣播演說後，已同意於憲章紀念日，播送各人之錄音唱片。聯合國廣播組官員稱，將照原定計劃，以廿一種語言對全球廣播。</p>
<h3>兩年來工作檢討</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖廿五日電〕聯合國憲章簽訂已屆兩週年之期，各國代表大抵承認聯合國機構之成敗，　於各會員國自身，尤其是中·美·英·法·蘇五大國，現無任何國有退出之徵象。但一般人均認爲聯合國機構尚在孩提時期，不足以當成人之大任。兩年前之六月廿六日，聯合國憲章在舊金山由五十個國家簽字，並爲波蘭預留地位。會員今已增至五十五國，其他國家尚在申請入會。兩年以來聯合國有積極之成就，亦有許多挫折。否決與繼續爭執之紀錄，安理會曾討論多種問題，包括伊朗問題，叙利亞與黎巴嫩問題；印度尼西亞問題；西班牙事件，及希臘與巴爾幹事件三起。處理紀錄證明蘇聯已自伊朗撤退軍隊，英法軍隊亦已自叙利亞及黎巴嫩撤退，巴爾幹調查團已從事實地調查。印尼問題因荷蘭指爲內政問題而未提付討論，西班牙問題則因聯合國機構忙於處理巴勒斯坦問題，暫予擱置。在社會與經濟方面，數十個有良心之代表以冗長時間，嘗試覓致　救世界　　之方法，其工作殊堪重視。</p>
<p>絕少成就</p>
<p>聯合國機構秘書長賴依最近發表演說稱，聯合國機構爲「生長中之機構」。賴氏指出五大國之爭執，仍爲兩年來阻撓聯合國機構之最大困難。戰爭仍有再萌之　，重要和約仍未簽字，紛爭繼續不已，將在聯合國各機構之討論中發生反　，並將使世界之復興工作延緩與複雜化。</p>
<p>組織概況</p>
<p>聯合國機構之組織益形複雜。該機構之中心爲六個機關，即（一）「大會」曾舉行三次，定今秋舉行第四次會議，巴勒斯坦問題列在議程之首。（二）「安理會」爲　平之警犬，至少每星期開會一次，爲聯合國機構中最有力之機關。大會僅有建議之權，安理會則有執行決議之權。（三）「經濟社會理事會」曾開會四次，並擬就廣大計劃，欲掃除全世界社會經濟病症，七月間又將開會。（四）「託管理事會」該會成立最遲，今年三月一度開會。（五）「國際法庭」一向設於海牙。安理會曾以英國與阿爾巴尼亞之水雷糾紛案交其處理。（六）「秘書廳」由挪威代表賴依任秘書長，任期五年，自一九四六年起，年俸二萬美元，外加辦公費二萬美元，職員二千六百人。一九四六年度預算經費在一千九百萬美元以上，一九四七年度在二千七百萬美元以上。此外，永久會址正在建造中。所費甚巨。</p>
<h3>聖地調查團　已與猶團體接觸</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社耶路撒冷廿五日電〕據此間所接消息：聯合國巴勒斯坦調查委員會已與猶太恐怖份子接觸，該會主席　斯特洛姆與委員胡世澤曾在德拉維夫城與猶太團體接觸，並匿名在該地住宿一　。</p>
<p>〔路透社加發廿四日電〕聯合國巴勒斯坦調查團今日自耶城乘車抵此調查時，猶太居民三萬人均閉戶不出。阿拉伯族之回敎徒及基督徒五萬四千人，似亦不感興趣。調查團一行汽車三十輛抵此時，僅有加發市長正式予以迎接，旁觀者寥寥數人。巴勒斯坦阿拉伯高級執委會之抵制會，執行似頗嚴格。</p>
<h3>馬卿將發表演說　闡明美外交政策</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿四日電〕國務院頃宣佈：各州州長定於七月十四日在鹽湖城舉行會議，屆時馬歇爾國務卿將發表演說云。據政界人士談稱：七月十四日適値法國國慶，馬帥大抵將闡明杜魯門主義，美國外交政策及其本身所提出之援助計劃云。</p>
<h3>美援歐計劃　爲開明政策產物</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿五日電〕馬歇爾國務卿之歐洲經濟復興計劃，乃發揚開明之顧全自身利益之信條，爲覓取協助歐洲工業實際辦法之努力。該計劃乃以美國援助歐洲避免未來一大災患爲原則，籲請採取下列各項步驟：第一，採納該計劃之歐洲國家即加入一經濟合作之共同計劃，此　國家　　於大陸性原則，提供資源，打破經濟壁壘並收受所需求之物資。其次，彼等應擬定一種計劃，概述所需要之外來援助，俾便美國參照自身之力量，審查此項計劃。最後，美國會應決定美國提供援助之數量及其提供辦法。</p>
<h3>復興德西部　應爲美援歐基礎</h3>
<p>馬卿致函貝文強調此點</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿四日電〕「約克郡郵報」本日載稱：美國國務卿馬歇爾曾致函英國外相貝文稱，德國西部之復興，必須爲美國援歐計劃之基礎。</p>
<h3>波願與他國合作　實施馬歇爾計劃</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿四日電〕波蘭駐美大使維尼　克茲，本日訪晤美國新任國務副卿洛維特時稱：波蘭將與歐洲其他各國合作，以實施美國務卿馬歇爾元帥所提出之援助歐洲經濟復興之計劃。波蘭準備參加草擬歐洲之復興計劃。波蘭刻正遭遇無數經濟困難，需要美國之經濟援助。</p>
<h3>英重視德國問題　對德意見書正在編製中　將由貝文外相携赴巴黎</h3>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦廿五日電〕外相貝文與美副國務卿克萊頓二次商談後，規定明日飛赴巴黎，俾在本星期五與法外長皮杜爾及蘇聯外長莫洛托夫會晤，討論歐洲適應美國務卿馬歇爾援歐復興計劃之最佳辦法，並將建議從速召集歐洲各國會議。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿四日電〕此間權威方面今日透露：貝文外相啓程赴巴黎參加三國會談時，携有德國在馬歇爾援歐計劃中所佔地位之特擬意見書。貝文於接獲莫洛托夫允許參加三國會談之通知後，即立即訓令德境英軍區長官陶格拉斯空軍元帥撰具德國問題與整個歐洲善後復興問題間關係之分析報告。此項計劃書刻猶在柏林編製中。觀察家益信德國問題將爲巴黎會談最微妙而最有希望之問題，蓋馬歇爾計劃於詳細研究之際，雖不能不重提德國經濟問題，但以美國之大規模援助既已有望，則蘇聯向德國主張之賠償需要，或能減少嚴重性。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科廿四日電〕此間外交觀察家談稱：馬歇爾國務卿之建議以經濟復興爲言，美國對此確不能置身事外，蓋　國四分之一之土地現爲美佔領軍所控制，故美國亦爲歐洲國家也。</p>
<h3>參加巴黎三外長會議　莫洛托夫今飛法　克萊頓或將以觀察員資格列席</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿四日電〕蘇外長莫洛托夫業已知照法國政府，定於星期四晨乘飛機來巴黎，參加馬歇爾計劃之討論。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿四日電〕據可靠方面消息：三國外長會議可能保守秘密，每日僅向報界發表簡單聲明一次，但關於此事之程序，將由三國外長自行決定。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿四日電〕據消息靈通人士稱：克萊頓或將於廿七日赴巴黎一行，以觀察員資格列席三國外長討論馬歇爾計劃會議。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿四日電〕法國方面對於蘇聯外長莫洛托夫應邀參加三國外長會議，討論馬歇爾援歐計劃，已感滿意，茲聞蘇聯並未提出任何限制討論範圍之保留條件，因而益見欣慰。據消息靈通人士談稱：英蘇法三國外長於廿七日舉行會議時將暫時避免討論基本問題（即美國援助之實際分配），而僅交換一般意見，極爲可能。三國外長若果立即着手詳細處理此一問題，匪特時機尚未成熟，抑且足以引起迄未成立協議之各種政治問題。若如外界所傳英美兩國因德國西部爲英美兩佔領區且爲歐陸之神經中樞而欲予德國西部以優先權，則法國殆將以安全爲理由，表示異議。蘇聯方面認爲各國之因受德國侵略而造成目前困難者，應先行予以援助。此種見解，當可獲得法國政府之同情。但有一端吾人必須明瞭者，即地方利益及國家利益，必須置於整個歐陸利益之下，而居於次要地位，三國外長會議之首要任務，將爲決定歐洲復興計劃之釐定方法。法國業已通知美國政府，表示法國贊成設立一特別委員會。據負責人士稱，此乃第一次之反應，三國外長在巴黎時，均須慮心下懷，不存偏見，共同討論整個問題云。</p>
<p>美國注意　蘇聯態度</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿四日電〕今日據悉，國務卿馬歇爾雖曾斷然否認美國在歐洲經濟復興前途採取主動地位，但美國仍將被迫參預其事。蓋美國在歐洲勢力，不僅控制德境美軍佔領區，且與德國西部英軍佔領區在經濟方面合作。國務院行動之決定大致繋於蘇聯參與馬氏歐洲經濟復興方案之態度。蘇聯如　意合作，美國或更傾向於保持嚴格超然地位。反之，美國勢將開始組織西歐經濟集團，美國即非被迫或亦願意　荷領導歐洲之無上任務。蘇聯同意參加英法蘇三國會議，此間咸認爲係一種令人興奮之徵兆。</p>
<h3>美衆院軍委會通過　派遣軍事使節團案</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓廿四日電〕美衆院軍事委會本日通過議案一份，該案對於美派遣軍事及海軍使團出國之問題，有詳盡之規定。按美國現在中國及伊朗，均派有此項使團。該案授權總統於平時運用戰時之權力，得應徇他國之請，並在總統認爲有利國家之條件下，派遣此項使團至他國政府。國務卿馬歇爾前曾表示支持此項議案，謂此項使團乃顧問團體，不應視爲作戰部隊或遠征軍。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統響應勞工　抨擊勞資新法案　美二十萬煤礦工人罷工</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕杜魯門總統今日領導政府，響應勞工，抨擊塔虎脫哈特萊勞工法案，報界則擁護國會，促請總統「盡其職責」，簽署法案。紐約州勞工調解委員會要員今日午後亦附和總統主張，譴責該案爲「勢不可行」。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿四日電〕民主黨衆議員勒辛斯　本日向衆議院提出一項法案，主張將塔虎脫與哈特萊所提出之勞工法案，予以取消，此項法案將交勞工委員會討論云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓廿四日電〕美煤礦工潮愈擴大，據負責方面估計，本日午後已有二十萬工人停止工作，將使每日煤斤產量減少五十萬噸。礦主復表示明日或將被迫將礦塲關門。煤礦工人聯合會會長魯易斯及其他工會領袖今皆嚴守沉默態度。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿四日電〕華盛頓烟煤礦工業代表估計，全國至少已有半數烟煤礦工實行怠工，恐不免擴大成全面性之煤礦工潮。此外營造業及牲畜業工人，亦已爲抗議新勞工法而怠工。勃羅克林，紐約，及紐傑　造船所工人一萬二千名，亦已決定於明日實行抗議性之罷工。</p>
<h3>抗議財政法案　法工潮蔓延</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿四日電〕法勞工聯合會頃發表聲明，對於甫經國民大會所通過之財政法案表示異議，並謂此項法案將使勞工階級增加負擔。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿四日電〕法國北部鑛工潮今日在蔓延中，聞里爾地方已有三萬工人停止工作，此爲該區工人人數之四分之一。巴黎銀行工潮今日仍未解決，停業已歷五日，百貨商店工潮可無變化，雪鐵龍汽車廠工人一萬一千人今日仍在罷工中。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎廿五日電〕法國工潮繼續不已，北方及卡萊省各煤礦工潮倘若擴大，將遭受經濟災患。</p>
<h3>義大利醞釀　全國總罷工　企圖推翻現政府</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬廿四日電〕共黨所控制之西西里島及義北部工人，今日實行罷工，企圖推翻加斯貝利之非共黨內閣。據勞工發言人稱，或將實行全國總罷工。</p>
<h3>根據救濟法案　美奧訂協定</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿五日電〕此間與維也納兩地今日同時公佈美國與奧地利在維也納簽訂之協定，是爲美國根據對於中國及歐洲六國三億五千萬美元救濟法案，與此等國家初次簽訂之協定。其中奧地利正式同意決不將救濟物質轉讓予蘇聯或其他佔領軍。據國務院官員宣稱：船隻廿三艘，裝載糧食，衣服，醫藥品及其他生活必需品，將在本月底以前自美國港口啓椗。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社新德里廿五日電〕英國參謀總長蒙哥馬利元帥今晨飛離此間，前往澳洲紐西蘭與日本視察。蒙氏在此曾與回敎冋盟主席眞納，印度國防部長巴爾特夫，英軍司令　　萊克等會談。聞蒙氏曾重申英國希望印回兩分治國能立即締結互助防禦條約。蒙帥並勸告尼赫　保持印度軍隊之現有實力與方式，並告以英國準備盡力協助印度防務。</p>
<p>〔中央社新德里二十四日合衆電〕美駐印大使格　第於今晨由美抵孟買後談稱，美國人與印度立於同一陣綫，吾人深信印度之未來偉大工作將獲成功。</p>

<h3>推行憲政有賴與論之輔助　新聞記者公會決議呈請政府　擴增國代記者名額</h3>
<p>本市新聞記者公會，日昨舉行常務理事會議，常務監事監理事會事實總務，組識，拼究，觸利四組組長亦均列席。各組組長報告會務後，經決議要案如下：（一）通過新會員名單，（二）呈請內政社會兩部在職業團體國大代表總名額之範圍內，僅量增加新聞記者團體應選之代表名額。茲誌該項呈文原詞如下：</p>

<h3>蘇聯擴張之企圖　與共黨跋扈有關　美報人昨招待記者　縱論國際現勢問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕乘汎美公司環珠機抵滬之美報業巨頭，昨日下午三時牛在都城飯店二樓會議廳招待本市記者。美報人出席者為國際新聞社發行人弗里斯，巴爾的摩太陽報號行人柏德遜，洛却斯特報系發行人肯納脫，米納巴里星報發行人柯爾，新奧里安時報發行人尼柯遜，基督教科學箴言報發行人凱能，紐約先鋒論壇報發行人里特夫人，霍斯登郵報發行人霍佩夫人等八人，對於中美關係及國際現勢分別答覆詢問如下；（一）對華</p>
<p>貸款問題，國際新聞社弗里斯稱：美國人民對於任何貸款均感頭痛，惟美人對中國向表同情，故中國當有優先權。洛却斯特報肯納脫稱：世人每多誤解美國有充分力量能任意幫助別國，但事實上吾人並不能無中生有，貸款之來源不外乎增稅及發行紙幣，而此兩奢均屬有害，故須鄭重其事。基督教科學箴言報凱能表示渠個人對於國府孫副主席最近談話之意見稱：美國對於中國之幫助，不僅在經濟政治方面，而係廣泛地幫助國內福利建設，以使其本身堅強而防止穌聯之擴張。渠認為蘇聯擴張之企圖與共產黨之跋扈有「相審」鬨係。（二）美國</p>
<p>對華態度問題，米納巴里星報柯爾稱：美人對華均抱友好態度，馬歇爾離華時之聲明，大致足以代表美國一般人民之思想，希望中國能停止內爭，團結起來。（三）對於聯合國組織之前途，洛却斯特報肯納脫認鴛聯合國能否成功，一言以蔽之，在於蘇聯之態度，如蘇聯肯妥協，即有成功之希望。對於馬歇爾建議之歐洲復興計劃，蘇聯雖巳接受，但鑒於以往事實，並不能令人寄以奢望。雖然吾人極願該計劃有所成就，以使歐洲經濟統一，解決當前困難。米納巴里星報柯爾則表示：渠對終聯合國之價值頗為懷疑，除非蘇聯放棄否決權，否則即使修改憲章亦屬無用。（四）</p>
<p>言論自由問題，各報人均否認言論自由在美國已受威脅，渠等認為在中國如言論自由被壓制，見賢思齊家形勢將更趨惡劣。此外各報人對於此次來滬晉京，均表示無上愉快，里特夫人與霍佩夫人更希望能多多了解中國，俾返美後能設法援助云。</p>
<h3>霍華德論日本無力東山再起</h3>
<p>美報業饒子霍華德昨向記者表示：蔣主席為一真正之愛國者，致力於改善人民之生活及民主之建設。中國離民主這目標尚遠，但民主之發展過程，本甚遲緩。關於美國可能之貸款，則因中國過去對於借款，浪費太多，今後如欲得新借款，必須有運用計劃，並須由美方派人監察其使用，借款方有成功之可能。詢以對遠東局勢的看法，霍氏認為蘇聯在遠東之野心，過去之歷史與今日東北之情形，在在可以說明。美國欲對抗此類擴張甚為困難，因美國不能發動第三次大戰。使蘇聯尊重條約。有謂行使外交上之壓力能使蘇聯就範者，實為孩提之見。</p>
<p>蘇聯政府今日在國內向人民宣傳美國已趨於衰弱，使人憶及二次大戰前德日之國內宣傳。事實上，即使在大戰過程中，蘇聯政府已　去租借物資上之商標，而向人民宣傳此類美國供應之飛機坦克卡車為本國製造者。固然蘇軍之英勇犧牲，值得欽敬，但如無美國物資之接濟，亦將失敗無疑。蘇聯政治一切均由政治局十四人決定，人民對國外情勢一無所知，任其牽引。余敢大膽作一預言，即美國固不願作戰，但局勢依此演變，將有一日逼使美國作戰，一如盧溝橋事變之於中國及珍珠港事件之對於美國者相同。論及</p>
<p>管制日本問題，記者告以國人對麥帥之政策不能同情時，霍氏不大以為然，認為麥帥之管制政策極為賢明，兩年內有此成就，非政治天才莫辨。其被選為世界十大偉人之首名，並非偶然。日本之軍事及工業潛能，今已完全摧毀。至於扶助上工業及准許其捕漁，乃為事實上之　要。美國不能長期負擔日本之給養，一如中國不能長期供給日本以糧食，然而亦不能聽任其饑餓，故扶助其復元為正當。至於畏懼日本東山再起一節，中國可不必過慮，因一則日本在戰爭中所受之損失，為現代史上所稀有者，二則美國在戰爭中所吃日本之虧不下於中國，未來之嚴密監視乃當然之事。本人戰後曾數度至日視察，所言自有根據。</p>

<p>紗價飛升</p>
<p>昨日紡建公司照例售紗，共四三三件。二十支水月價開五百四十萬元，塲上交易暢旺，業內外人扒吸不已，本街染織廠搜購胃口亦强，致租細各紗俱創新高峯。四二支藍鳳昻至一千八百六十萬元，比上日續漲一百十萬元。二十支特變馬一千一百四十萬元，軋升八十萬元。雙馬紗亦出千萬元大關，昴升至一千零四十萬，上揚九十五萬元。其餘十六支等各紗，均升六七十萬不一。</p>

<h3>國際貨幣基金會反對　以非份價格買賣黃金　建議會員國以有效行動制止交易</h3>
<p>路透社華盛頓二十四日電：國際貨幣　金會業已要求各會員國速即採取行動，以制止超過向基金會登記金價或匯率之黄金交易。基金會今日發表之文吿有謂，國際貨幣基金會對於世界各地超過登記價値之國際黄金交易，業已予以考慮。由於此事之重大，基金會特準備如下之聲明，以表示其意見。査基金會之主要目的，在穩定世界之匯兌，基金會認爲以直接或間接引起貶價外匯交易之價格，繼續不斷向外購買或出售黄金，足以損及匯兌之穩定。本會根據已獲之情報，相信若不予以制止，前述之活動將益趨擴大，卒使各會員國間之匯兌關係爲其所擾。且此等交易結果，大部份黄金均流八私人之手，並不集中於中央機構，使貨幣凖備金有漸趨減少之廣。職是之故，本會强力反對以非份價格，從事國際黄金交易。並建議各會員國採取有效行動，以制止與他國或他國國民之此等交易。本會並建議會員國政府，本於局勢之需要，與其他非會員國政府接治，協力消滅此一使匯兌失去穩定性之來源。然金會對於因超過登記價格之國內黄金交易所引起之問題，亦會予以硏究。結果決定除此等交易，足以影響新匯率之訂立，損及其他會員國之匯率，或使一會員國之國際財政地位有嚴重之削弱，卒至影響該國之利用本會基金等情形外，暫時尙不擬予以反對。基金會已要求其會員國迅述探取行動，以實行本文吿內所列之建議案。</p>
<h3>各方搜購存底頗枯　人造絲創新高價</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲開盤時甚平穩後因經各方搜購，市上存底頗枯，一致扳俏，造成新高價。一二〇號高山有光。先喊二千二百八十萬元，旋即升至三百萬元有成交。迨後因買意甚濃，上升至四百萬元爲中午收盤價。下午漲勢更厲，五百萬元有成交，最後喊五百五十萬元賣出，比上日竟高達三百萬元之譜。七五號金雞半光，喊價三千四百萬元，因價過高而乏成交。</p>
<p>昨市廠經交易仍寂，上午喊價較軟，下午因杭州綢廠帮頗有進胃，故呈堅昻。五担頭高匀度並無成交，下午喊價與上日相仿。昨中蠶公司有四十包開出，爲E字等級，價做二千九百五十萬元。另担成交價與上日相同，干經去路呆滯，有單子貨喊價二千一百萬元。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨始平終昻，　强被面先做一千〇九十五萬元，後喊一千一百十五萬元。美亞被面一千二百萬元未成交，大誠格子　縐開市喊價三萬九千七八百元，後經多方拉抬，冉冉上升，由四萬〇二百元而至五百元，最後八百元爲賣出價，隔日期喊一千元。華錦縐上午仍做上日盤子，高檔貨喊二千元，下午因人絲狂跳，價亦提升至二萬四千元。無光紡等亦稍見高，盛貨與杭貨價堅站未更。</p>
<h3>捲菸市況挺秀</h3>
<p>昨日捲姻市况，初開即見挺俏，各牌喊價堅昻，塲中轉賣亦稀’業中人一味拖進，曾有照掛牌各價，加碼買進，致市氣昻騰，市而遂被哄上。十支大英姻至午市結果價昻至七百三十七萬元，比上日回漲六十二萬元，老刀姻亦激升五十七萬元，爲六百三十七萬元，五華升十八萬元，哈德門外埠去化不弱，初做五百萬元，逐步上升至五百卅五萬元，軋升卅五萬元。</p>
<h3>市塲交易淸淡　食米由堅轉疲　榨油原料到稀價格暴漲</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧八千一百餘石，店方實銷淸開，市塲交易冷懈，市况重入下游。粳米回挫萬餘元，秞米中下下跌一二萬元，白元亦隨之跟跌一二萬元，險元亦削萬元。</p>
<p>麪粉消化雖然平常，奈產地粉市較申地爲高，小麥趨勢牢硬，粉市明疲暗堅之狀，頗俱脚地。　皮鄕轉淡，續跌二三千元。</p>
<p>豆餅交易平平，回低一二千元，營口餅下挫五六千元，黄豆隨各物下降二三千元。紅糧高貨不多，形居站局。苞米暫無榮辱，生仁華南進胃活躍，扶搖直上，續漲一二萬元。芝蔴到不敵銷，洋莊納意蟬聯，節節上升，再加萬元。</p>
<p>菉豆到銷兩不見吒，無甚波動，赤豆廣方略有問津，按步上漲，再高萬元。小麥廠胃頗貪，內地堅挺，回漲四五千元。蠶豆汕頭台灣停辦，頓形軟化，猛跌萬元。</p>
<p>油市堅疲不一，生油廣帮採購，形趨堅挺之狀。豆油廠方供源接續，平疲之格。淸油軟化，菜油挺站，蔴油立定。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕食油通日又吿滕漲，據業中人談：近因在東北大豆外運中止，榨油原料來源受阻，人心虛恐，故扒購者　起。其次爲黑市外匯之暴漲，米價之復昻，均成直接簡接促成漲價之因素。一般油商，目光中仍戰前食油與食米之比價是瞻。聞是時食油市價，每担可抵食米兩担云。</p>
<h3>外股漲風又起　統債市況極平</h3>
<p>公債昨極平定，起仆有限，成交仍祗二百餘萬。統丙晨開七五〇〇元，自七四五〇元起，升至七九〇〇元結束。洋行帮及五五二室五〇三室俱進，三六〇室五五五室則出，結果較前收計甲乙戊各漲二百元，丙丁平平。</p>

<h3>新疆來漫談西陲事</h3>
<p>— 廿二日快訊　蔣信</p>
<p>居留西北三年，時間不能算短；但也許是聽慣，看慣，生活慣了，眞的連自己所處的是芝闌之室，抑或是鮑魚之肆，都有些辨別不淸楚。起初固未嘗不覺得有些訝怪，但久而久之，昨天如此，今天如此，明天大槪還是如此，反正事實如此，則又何怪之有？並且見到居斯境者，大家彷彿都無所感於中，而自己倘獨覺異怪，豈不更怪？所以，在我初到西北不久，曾幾思將所觸所感，爲文報吿國人，終以事繁手懶，未及執筆；再後，覺得現實已經如此，尙有何話可說？講了亦未必即能引起他人的注意。</p>
<p>邊疆告警</p>
<p>自三月初離開西北，現在也不過剛滿三個月，時間更不能算長，然心情上却眞的有「如隔三秋」之感，對西北一切又好像都很陌生。新疆吿警，全國震動，而自己也不覺隨着驚起來，亟思將個人過去的所見所聞，爲國人一吐爲快！不過因個人奉命去國倉促，所有過去搜獎的材料，都未能帶來，現在僅能就記憶所及，信筆漫談一下。</p>
<p>凡住在西北的人，對於「邊疆糾紛」四字，都是很諳熟於耳的。特異的是過去大家僅限於熱烈的口耳相授，問或在西北當地的報紙上可以看到一點，其正式經中央社用電報發佈出來，傳遍全國，還要以這次爲「創舉」，重要者如前年曾擾動整個西北所謂「伊寗事件」，也不過在「和平條款」將要簽訂時吝裔地露過兩次「嬌顏」，而那眞正砲火迎天，血肉模糊的緊張塲面，都被外交家的紅筆删去了。記得其時我方做敦煌之遊，特繞到甘肅玉門的油礦去參觀，該油礦在新疆烏蘇設有分礦，當事幾緊急時烏蘇分礦隔一小時便有一通急電拍來，請總局速派車輛接應職工撤退。其時守護油礦的僅有國軍一營和百數十個礦營，而敵人則有兩團並附大砲數門，總局雖立即遣派十數部馬克空車前往接應，但計時車子尙不會趕到哈密，則烏蘇礦早已陷了。事後一位烏蘇礦負責人吿訴我’我們撤退時已自動將礦井堵塞破壞，機器全失，職工傷亡亦不少。單由油礦局這一局面的反映看來，也可推知當時戰事的全貌是怎樣一個規模了。可是從首至尾，除去等到和平解決爲止，報紙上是看不到有一個字的消息的。並且後來有一位參與戰事的軍官親自吿訴我說，每次作戰，在第一綫衝鋒的都是我們自己同胞，而在後面督戰以及砲兵的射手却都是不折不扣的「×國人」。尤其在攻略城鉅時，更全是淸一色！但當時報紙上連「某國」字樣都看不到，好像該二字專用於「東北區」，而在「西北區」不能通用似的。現在即一躍而呌出「有帶有蘇聯標幟的飛機助戰，眞是破天荒第一遭</p>
<p>更如本年一月間的大慘案。依據伊寗事件和平條款的規定，漢族同胞本來可以重回到伊，塔等區域住居的。但當一月間某日，有百十位漢族同胞回到俄邊的塔城地區時，天適傍晚，他們因無家可歸，乃不得不露天而宿，結果夜間會聽到一陳激烈的槍響，第二天早晨一看，原來那批難民除少數先裝假死而後得脫者外，大部份都長眠那裏了。這件事情報紙上也始終未見登過一個字；，只有受難同胞用油印傳單向各處散發呼籲，結果也好像汪洋大海裏發出的一綫微弱的求救聲一般，不會得到什麽回響的！</p>
<p>我們眞奇怪！像這種邊疆紏紛，在過公確是「迭有」發生的，但政府爲什麽不把它隨時公諸國人，却一直封銷到現在，難道眞的作與在使國人「突然」吃此「一驚」嗎？其間主要原因大概是：一年來我國政府為顧全中蘇友好關係，對蘇聯違反中蘇條約之種種事實，例如阻止我國接收旅大，支持東北共軍及韓國共軍作戰，慫恿外蒙入侵我邊境造成北塔山事件等等，多所容忍械默，證諸今日之事態，實已不容坐視。據悉我政府已決定不再採取過去之綏靖政策，改取强硬的外交，將一切事實控訴全世界！</p>
<p>塔城出國</p>
<p>一位久駐新疆的空軍朋友告訴我如下的事實：</p>
<p>「單就塔城」帶而論，原來中蘇的國境綫還在塔城以北很遠很遠，但不到幾年的工夫，現在國界碑已經跑到塔城城下了。塔城城是在一座小山頭上，城北山脚跟下便成了俄境。原因是人家　可以揹了國界碑隨便跑，隨便殺，我們是無人過問的。假使這稱現象繼續發展下去，塔城眞要不領外交部的護照而自行出國了。……」</p>
<p>他又說：「我們在邊疆並無駐軍，更無所謂防衛措施。反之，人家則不然了，沿國界碉堡林立，並均派有軍隊把守；並且國內的火車一直可以通到離國境不遠的地方，運輸極便！凡國人如有在距國境綫十里以內行走的，都有被射殺的危險，因爲鄰國駐軍常喜歡利用這　會打靶的。…」</p>
<p>胡騎牧馬</p>
<p>筆者會登過邊境綫上的馬鬃嶺，訪問過李華所會慨歌憑弔的古戰塲，越過馬　嶺不遠便是外葉古了。據當地老百姓吿訴我，成羣的胡騎（過去是同胞，現在可以這樣說了），常常跑到山南邊來牧馬的。如東有行旅被他們撞見，便會被搶個凈光，甚至說不定連性命也不能保！</p>
<p>總之，有如此之邊疆，又有如此之國防，無怪一旦發現邊疆吿警，已經是深入國境六百里以內了。</p>
<p>若干年來，新疆一直是多事。論者探索其因，咸以爲是由於民族過分複雜所致。惟據筆者幾年本在西北的實際觀察所得，却並不願同意這種說法。我認爲民族複雜，語言不統一，僅爲可能構成社會秩序紊亂的一個條件，而並非爲其必然的原因。因事實上有比新疆民族更複雜，語言更繁多的國家，仍然還可以得到安定。即如毗鄰新疆的寗夏，靑海，甘肅等省，民族都並不單純，語言也多不相同，但紏紛却不如新疆之多。我們在西北住，可以說無時不與服分五色，生活習慣各　的同胞相接觸，但大家均能平等相處，而各族間亦並不曾常發生什麽齷齪。反過來講，更如在最單純的漢族自己，却自民國以來一直演着慘酷的自殺戰，到現在更是不可收拾了。故民族複雜僅爲一種可能造成紛亂的條件，只有在有人想利用它，挑動它時，它始可表演出紛擾的事實。新疆的內情正是如此。不幸的是過去旣曾因錯誤而浩成過一段悲慘的歷史，現在又加以內有野心政各，外有特殊勢力想將它加以利用，由此乃使新疆欲安定而不可不得了。大儿熟悉新疆內情的人，都曉得無論各族的民衆都是希望能有一個比較安定的生活的，並不想以互相殘殺爲　業。甚至曾經受過某方訓練的人，現在也都有了覺悟，　得某方純想利用他們，並不是眞正想使他們得到自由利幸福。不過，直到今日，還能配合大部份人民希望求安定的心瑪，將他們爭取過來，使內外的野心家都無計可售。</p>
<p>農業礦產</p>
<p>故意想造成新疆不安的內都野心家的用心何在，我們不想冬加討論，對於外來勢力的居心何在，却是値得硏究的。據筆者的觀察，經濟的成分跟政治的成分都非常大。在過去，在新疆造成的紛擾不會對延安總部有多大直接的帮助，現在，也未見得是爲了配合東北的軍事行動，即今事實上已有一箭　鵰的功效，這不能不予以解釋，但主要還在經濟方面。</p>
<p>「中蘇友好條約」簽訂後，今日看到外蒙古的軍隊入侵，這固是一種顯然的謀果，但在倏約簽訂的當時，中國部也未嘗不有曇花一現的好處，那便是使新疆局面得到暫時的澄淸。蘇軍相率由新疆的哈密·迪化·烏蘇各地撤退，事業機關亦交由中國接收，尤以烏蘇油礦，據一位主持人講，蘇軍臨走時均將礦井塡塞，機器搬走，原認爲在三數年內中國是無力修復的，不想我們很快的便使它又能出油了。按烏蘇油礦論規模並不太大，但油質却高過王門。並據專家稱：烏蘇礦乃與高加索油田爲同一油源，倘中國在烏蘇大量開採（原計劃要大規模採煉的），是直接會影響到高加索的。這正如兩個孩子同吃一個母親的乳一般難免不互相嫉妬；嫉妬的結果，力量較大的哥哥自然想要把小弟弟推開了。所以從經濟的立塲着眼，以伊犁河流械的農產（全新疆需用食糧均仰賴於此區）和烏蘇的石油礦去解釋上次的伊戒事件，不能說沒有一部分道理的。至少由此一變，新疆的主要精華便全部喪失了　並且，新疆備煤甚富，質地亦好，這是已經證明了的。此外，過去還傳說新疆產鎢亦多，鎢是一種稀金屬，爲鍊鋼所不可少。但抗戰期間中國都把它運售給美國了，而隣國部却無從得，因之心中當亦常感不滿。近一年餘來原子彈出世後，大家又盛傳新疆有爲製造原子彈所不可少的鈾原料的儲藏，該項礦穴已為隣國所發現，並且說，就在阿爾仄山附近。筆者非礦冶專家，對傳說的眞實性，現在未敢妄置然否，但這種繪聲繪影的傳說，却是常常聽到的。對此隣國起初會要求學獨開採，中國未允，繼要求合辦，又被拒絕，因之，當亦難使愜安於心的，依據上面這兩種不快心理，來看這次外蒙古的入侵事件，或也有多少蛛絲馬跡的關係。</p>
<p>提高警覺</p>
<p>以一個只有九十萬人口的外蒙古，如無外力支持，當亦不足實現武力服人的迷夢。不過，即令外交上能得到一個暫時的妥協，但問題仍不是眞正解決，說不定接　會有第二個，第三個北塔山事件到來，使已經是　接不斷的邊疆糾紛，更擴大的發展下去！要解決這個問題，須兼由內部着手。因爲能使內部穩定以後，不啻等於堵塞了外來勢力的門窗，斬斷了內在野心家的足翼，使他們永無施展魔力的餘地了。</p>
<p>現在新疆負責者最主要的工作，乃是怎樣補償歷史上的積債，將失去的民心再收回來。這工作看似不易，實際上並不難！因為過去的不安定，才使千魅百怪乘虛而入。無可諱言的，現在新疆已成了野心家和冒險者的樂園，此種現象不早澄除，將來是不堪設想的。安定，安定，惟有安定方是搶救新疆的一劑良藥。</p>
<p>北塔山事件發生後，許多人主張「提高警覺」，「靜觀演變」，筆者認爲是很對的。新疆確是我國多事之區，而且關係重要，我們不應漠視。可惜至今似還未能引起國人的普遍注意。新疆是我們的大門，關聯着我們整個國運的安全，我們不能不把它守牢。但在目前態度上，亦不可操之過急，問題能合理解決的，應當訴之於理。最後更盼國人不要把新疆着做西北的不毛之區，它不僅地位衝要，而且有豐饒的農產，富厚的礦藏，尤以石油一項，據專家勘査後的報吿，整個西北幾乎遍地皆有蘊儲。這一切當都與我們未來建國具有極密切的關係。記得筆者在甘肅酒泉時，曾聽到一位哈薩女郎的歌曲，它曾給我以極深刻的印象；現在抄錄一段於後，做爲本文的結束，以期喚起國人的注意：</p>

<h3>從戰鬥中獲救的　孤城安陽</h3>
<p>— 鄭州廿日航訊　本報記者范世勤</p>
<p>鄭州車站每日送往迎來的虛套是相當頻繁，可是這幾天各方面的人士去迎接由安陽撤遝出來的傷病官兵與青年學子，那是最出於眞情的。單是從小學生把一些糖果錢來慰勞那些將士與青年的一件事來看，就會知道受了一種人的無理的威逼必爲受另一種人的加倍的慰藉。那些傷病官兵與靑年學生，獲得優先權利，由飛機運到新鄉後，換車來鄭。那些學生前後送運，是經過抽籤的方式，可調非常公平。</p>
<p>安陽危急飛機尙未投糧之際，安陽城內外五十萬的人民的生計，是大家最懸念的。據說：那時難民多半是以草根樹皮充飢，學生以最劣等的混合雜糧與馬料果腹。所有生命寄托在勇敢的戰鬥身上，勇敢的戰鬥寄托在飽滿的肚子身干，原來已是珍貴的糧食自然成了更珍貴的東西。每次國軍出擊，後面就有成千成萬的難民擁隨着，國軍勝利回來，後面仍是那些完成千成萬的難民擁隨着；那些難民去的時候，個個帶着一只空袋，回來的時候，個個負着一只滿袋，起初是國軍勸着難民去搶糧，以後是難民勸着國軍去出擊，是出擊而搶糧，還是搶糧而出擊，實在也是分不淸楚。當時，城內的當局，要求人民儲兩個月糧，有錢的人家和商號，必須把大部份錢去買糧。在這個被圍的孤城裏，到什麼地方去買糧？可是事實上眞有一個賣買糧食的市塲。這市塲的形成，是一個</p>
<p>戰爭奇蹟每天城裏要買糧的人，都跑到城外的一個僻靜的空塲裏去，那地方就有許多賣糧的人在等候他們，他們交易完了以後，從城裏出來的買糧的人回到城裏，而賣糧的人也就不見了。這樣天天如此，據守過城門的學生統計；每天這樣弄進城裏的糧，是有二千多担。這個城外靜僻的空塲，好像有魔力一般，從來沒有落過一顆彈。這些每天在這市塲上來去賣糧的人，頗有些像神奇小說襄神的化身專爲來救那些苦難的人民的，其實他們也是像那些苦難的人民一樣，他們是爲了換城裏人的餘鹽從</p>
<p>火綫縫裏偸逃過來的四鄉有餘糧的一種鄉下人。人民在這樣情形之下在自救，眞是偉大。但這其閒不能不承認有些神的力量在護助着，據說今年安陽四鄉的收成，是過去從來所沒有的鼎盛。</p>
<p>據他們說：安陽被圍時期，除了晚上八時起，或白天隨時有短時間的戒嚴情形外，一切都是與平時一樣。黄包車夫仍舊在拉着車，館子裏還是有肉有魚。一般的東西，當然跌價，也當然糧食是特別貴，曾經要三萬元一斤。</p>
<p>守東陽城四十師師長李振淸，老百姓和士兵天天能見到他，所不同的是時間上的差別，即是在沒有戰鬥的時候，他出現在老百姓的面前。在有戰鬥的時候，他出現在士兵的面前。他的部隊，</p>
<p>軍紀如鐵，一個士兵爲着搶人家三萬多元錢，被他槍斃，就是這樣發生過一件的事情。學生們帮助他防備城裏有混入的壞人，晚上學生們爬到屋頂上守防，從一個　人把一枝信號槍掛在樹上用繩在樹底下拉放的事情發覺以後，城內更是安安靜靜。</p>
<p>城外一段鐵路，始終在國軍手裏控制着，有兩輛鐵甲車來往不斷在巡邏，老百姓都說這是守門的兩只獅子。</p>
<p>據說劉伯誠還想進攻東陽，但這次沒有聽說他預備要在三個星期中取東陽的話，大概他心裏準備把他所有「本錢」都輸在東陽了吧！</p>

<h3>談廣東叢書</h3>
<p>— 陸丹林</p>
<p>廣東叢書編印委員會印行　商務印書館出版</p>
<p>廣東叢書，是我國抗戰後出版界偉　大的典籍之一。他是由廣東叢書編印委員會所編印第一集的叢報。此會在民國二十九年成立於香港，經費的來源，大部分由奧省政府撥助，是一個半公私性質組織的機構。常務委員爲葉恭綽（兼主杯委員）簡又文，陸丹林三人。委員許地山，徐信符，黃華表，黃蔭普，陳樂素等十三人，尙有顧問許崇淸，李漢魂，蔣復璁，陳垣，王雲五，張元濟，李應林，袁同禮等五十三人。編印略例，是以有關廣東文獻爲範圍，並先采集廣東人士之著述。（不錄生存人的著述，但纂輯舊著除外）所選板本，悉取罕見難得的，間或取較次之本，皆別有其原因，如此次曲江集是用經溫汝适詳細批校之本，即是一例。</p>
<p>第一集書目，在二十九年冬間，即巳選定，經詳細校訂一過，即與商務印書館商訂出版。本定三十年冬問，完全出書。詎料一部分印就之後，即値日閥發動南太平洋戰爭，因之有一部分印好之書運到香港，便遭散佚。存在上海正在工作中的書稿，又因工料關係，事變叢生，無法繼續工作。延至勝利後，雙方經過好幾次的商洽，選工添料，歷年一年左右，纔將全部叢書完全出版。計自初次發稿而至全部完成，歷時七年，始能告竣。在抗戰期間，公私文物，損失無數，而此叢書，雖經過許多波折，終能安然無恙的出書，這不能不說是出版界欣幸的一件事。</p>
<p>廣東叢書第一集，共書七種，分釘二十八册。全書用上等連史紙精印，綫裝本，其中十之七八是用原本影印，十之二三是排印。每一種書，除前人有批校的之外，復經詳細校訂，如有疑義，必把各刻本相勘，務臻完善，纔行付印，今把各書內容略述於後。</p>
<p>（一）張曲江集，唐張九齡撰，番禺徐氏南州書樓藏溫汝适批校本，十二卷八册，附溫汝适撰，徐氏南州書樓藏原刻本曲江集考證二卷，年譜一卷。嶺南文家，張曲江是最古。曲江集版刻可考的有八種，現在所用的爲溫汝适精研二十多年的批校本，可以說是海內最可珍貴的張曲江渠了。</p>
<p>（二）武溪美，宋余靖撰，常熟瞿氏鐵琴銅劍樓藏明成化刻本，二十卷六册，附中山黃佛頤緝武溪集補佚一卷，余襄公奏議二卷。余氏與張曲江同爲韶州唐宋間傑出人物，余氏之才，長於應變，文章也同此風格，不名一體。丘濬在成化本的序文，把他與張曲江並列，是有他的原因在的。</p>
<p>（三）北燕巖集，明黃公輔撰，中山李氏秋波琴館番禺黃氏憶江南館藏原刻本，四卷二册。魏璫亂政，黃氏抗疏參劾，義聲直天下。愛君忠國，年八十四而自焚，遺烈千秋，詩文尤有他的獨特風格。</p>
<p>（四）禮部存稿，明陣子壯撰，徐氏南州書樓藏原刻本，八卷三册。陳氏貞忠殉國，節烈垂諸宇宙，他反對異族侵略，深足爲民族的光輝。此書多屬例行疏草，如調護東宮，輔弼宗藩，立朝大節，都可在行間字裏見着。所提議各節皆切要可行，可見到他的抱負。陳氏遺著南宮雲淙各集，已不可得，練要堂集，也殘缺不完，只有此集是完全的，更可珍貴了。</p>
<p>（五）蓮鬚閣文鈔，明黎遂球撰，徐氏南州書樓藏舊鈔本，十八卷三册。世所稱嶺南才子牡丹狀元黎美屬的詩文集。此書向無刊本，屬手鈔秘笈，至爲珍寳。潘來評其集爲：「讀其文，即錦心繡口，鏤月而裁　，……乃能捐　殉國，取義成仁！勇斷　雲之指，憤嚼睢陽之　。……」可見一般了。</p>
<p>（六）喻園集，明梁朝鍾撰，徐氏南州書屢藏原刻本，四卷三冊。梁氏是反抗淸兵而殉國，大節凜然，可歌可泣。他的文章，更爲世所矜式。喻園集在乾隆間，給淸　銷燬，此爲海內孤本。禺山正氣，亘古常存，民族精神，自有他不可磨減的存在。</p>
<p>（七）翁山文鈔，明屈大均撰，黃氏憶江黃館藏淸初刻本，四卷三册，附徐信符輯翁山文輯三卷。屈氏生平不朽著作，雖屬四朝成仁錄，刻在整理校勘中。文鈔四卷，分序，記，碑，碑記，傳等。王士楨許屈氏詩如李太自所云：「咳唾落九天，隨風生珠玉」。文呢，學博詞沛，有發而不能禦之勢，此集收集，最爲豐富。</p>
<p>全書因戰事損失了一部分，能够整部成集的只得二百多部。各書均屬海內孤本，初本，精校本，秘笈本而成，他不特在戰後出版界中偉大的典籍，而在中國文獻上尤有他的特殊位置與供獻，非只關係嶺南一隅的鄉邦文化，發揚民族精神而已。此書大部分已運粵銷售。不久，上海方面也公開發資。至第二集書目，刻下在甄選研討中，不日亦可決定付印了。</p>
<h3>無綫電原理及應用</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>赫卿孫著，丁曦譯，開明書店出版，一萬二千元</p>
<p>關於無綫電書籍的譯本，往往失之過於專門偏奧，不適合給普通業餘玩玩的同志們的需要，而且精通無綫電的又不一定精通外國語與外國文尤其是後者，一般無綫電學者多比較修養少些，要將國外科學方面的名著，介紹翻譯到本國來，自不是一件輕而易舉的工作，所以有許多譯本，原著確是在國外風行一時的傑作，可是中文本却讀起來結屈聱牙，難以消化，加之譯名的不統一，國內外情形的迥異，很多在無綫電事業發達的國家裏視爲平凡的東西，一搬到中國來，甚至運另件都難以配置，這種情形極爲普遍。况且譯一本書總得化上好些功夫，在目前的環境下，更是困難。由此種種因素，想在坊間難得找到一本適用的書。</p>
<p>本書的優點除了內容的適切充實之外，更可貴的是譯者筆調的流暢，幾乎看不出它是一本譯作。自始至終，一氣連貫，確是用過不少功夫，對於我國國情不合的地方，都註有譯者個人的意見及註解，參考我國無綫電市塲的狀况，補充原著的不足，並且附有許多國貨優良出品的圖照特點等，使讀者不致看了摸不着頭腦，與外界實際狀况相間隔。</p>
<p>全書共十二章，第一章先將幾個最基本的電學原理簡單地叙述一下，所以一般沒有受過較高的教育而對無綫電有特殊興趣愛好的朋友們，也可以將本書作爲踏進圈子第一步的讀本。最後一節略述比較新的無綫電知識，（這並不是深奧說教式的理論，）將「電視」「電傳有聲電影」「電傳照相術」等用淺易的筆調，按照讀者讀完本書後所有的程度來講，使讀者懂得一些這種新東西的基本慨念，進而引起讀者對無綫電好奇心，打破無綫電是一種艱深的科學，可望而不可接的惡觀念。書中兼顧理論與實騐，嚴格地說，似乎比較偏重前者。在後幾章講到應用方面，往往穿叙較深的原理，然而也就是本書的好處，因爲它由淺入深，而非平舖直叙，使讀者對實騐不致只能依樣葫蘆，依着綫路圖另件表裝裝拆拆，而能自已設計運用，別出心裁的啓發自己的智　。在眞空管的一章裏，還附有各式常用眞空管每一型的特性，曲綫圖·底座圖等，使讀者在裝置的時候有所借鏡，便利不少。在新式多管收音機的一章中，更將檢波段·低放·高放段·輸出級各部門詳細解說，並且使讀者知道怎樣交連·配合·設計。自非普通版本只是收集幾張綫路圖就算了事的所可比擬其萬一。</p>
<p>無綫電是件日新月異的東西，這本太書還是一九三三年原作者再版訂正的，到目前已經是一隔十四年之久，這期間無綫電事業的突飛猛晋自不待言，原作者由於本書的暢銷，想必自然每版加入新資料，與時俱進，可是本書的中譯本雖然也已經銷至十版左右，而內容却還是文風未動依然故我，希望譯者及出版者加以注意，雖然我國無綫電事業落後，國外過新的東西並不十分適合我們的脾胃，然而總得儘量改進，庶免落在人家太後面呀！</p>
<h3>民衆週刋（顧頡剛主編）</h3>
<p>— 孟琨</p>
<p>近來萎靡的出版界，比重又偏於雜誌方面。但無論什麼期刊，都只是以智識份子或小市民爲對象，就是後者，往往也僅提供給他們以趣味或娛樂。「民衆週刊」是一份以不識多少字的中下階層的人民爲讀者的，這一點，我們覺得非常需要，而該予以推荐並提倡。</p>
<p>「民衆週刊」出版到目前，一共是四期。在這四期中，已可極淸晰地看出牠整個的風格和路向。牠介紹極簡單的時事，極通俗的常識，帶一些學習性的文字也很多，尤其偏重於讀書議字的進修方面。每一篇文字，在形式上是那麼淺顯，甚至於儘可能地採用歌謠的格式；內容上，也容易懂，容易接受。最値得提出的，是牠每一篇文字無不與大衆的生活有關。</p>
<p>在民衆敎育停頓的現在，在通俗讀物缺少的現在，有這麼一本雜請問世，値得重視；我們應該欣賞顧頡剛先生的努力和發行當局的善良意志。</p>
<p>不過我們在批評上，更該密予一些希望，希望牠能更按近些民衆，做一最最普遍的啓蒙讀物。寫稿的諸作者最好有事先的計劃，確定若干數目的必要字彙，作爲國民識字的長低標準。應多一些圖，介紹些週遭的情形，或利用看圖識字，使無暇多識字的小民增廣些讀書的能力。若是印刷按術可能，宜在每一單字傍添加國航注音符號。</p>
<p>最希望的，倒是出版方面跟着走，辦些類似的刊物。</p>
<h3>世界政治參考圖</h3>
<p>— 新俊</p>
<p>金仲華編　朱育薄繪　世界知識社印刷發行</p>
<p>對於一個國際時事研究者或愛好者，備置一本正確的政治參考圖是必需的，因爲由此可以加强我們對國際時事的更深一步的瞭解。</p>
<p>二次大戰後的國際形勢，顯然的與以前是有着很大的不同，經過了幾年殘酷的戰爭之後，世界是轉變了，成功了今日資本主義與社會主義兩大營的對壘，同時資本主義問矛盾之加劇，這樣一個新形勢世界現象的表現下，再看舊的地圖，總會有點隔膜。</p>
<p>在出版界中，對於國際政治的書籍很多，而對於國際政治的參考地圖却很少，目前可以說是簡直沒有。現在世界知識社出版了這一本「世界政洽參考圖」可以說是每一個注意國際問題者的嘉音。</p>
<p>這是一本比較完全而且比蛟有系統的國際政治地圖，內容搜集了二次大戰後世界間的政治活動，舊集編製而成。詳細而且正確。</p>
<p>這裏面一共包括了六十一副圖，分爲六個部分：</p>
<p>第一個部分：是戰後世界形勢，有八副地圖——（一）職後世界形勢圖，（二）聯合國的全貌，（三）聯合國託管地域圖，（四）原子彈歷史發展圖，（五）美蘇對峙下北極周圍形勢圖，（六）各國爭奪下南極大陸形勢圖，（七）巴特探險隊出發南極路綫圖，（八）世界石油區域分佈圖。</p>
<p>這些地圖裏面，詳細地顯示出戰後世界形勢，而且在每個地圖之前，都附有簡明的說明。這證明是每一副岡都有的。</p>
<p>第二個部分，則爲五强之部，它繪出戰後世界中的美國，蘇聯，英國，中國與法蘭西，共右十二副地圖說明，對五强間的各部門，都充分地解說到。</p>
<p>第三個部分是歐洲之部，這裏包括的國家更多，共有：義大利，匈牙利，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞，分蘭，奧地利，荷蘭，比利時，波蘭，南斯拉夫，希臘，西班牙等等。它分了二十二個說明與地圖，來繪出這些國家的特點與其展望。</p>
<p>第四個部分，是中東之部，這裏用了九副地圖，表現出這一部分的各方面的問題，如國際鬥爭，石油問題，諸項。</p>
<p>第五個部分則爲遠東之部，是包含着日本，朝鮮，菲律實，越南，印　乏部。</p>
<p>第六個部分是美洲之部，這是比較簡單的，包括阿根廷，阿拉斯加，加拿大這三個地方。</p>
<p>總觀這些內容，其豐富與精彩，是一望而知的。</p>
<p>最後，我得想到這地圖的編者和繪者，編者金仲華先生，是服務於美國新聞處，他的國際研究是誰都知道的，這些地圖裏面的說明，都是金先生所作。</p>
<p>繪者先育蓮先生，是一位靑年的繪岡者，他的成就，是可匯之於事實的。</p>
<p>這地圖的唯一缺點，是沒有分區設色，以及紙張的較差，這大概為出版條件所限，那是沒有辦法的。</p>
<h3>「街頭文談」</h3>
<p>— 家</p>
<p>徐懋庸著　光明書局印行</p>
<p>『街頭文談』一書中，包含廿八篇短文；依照內容概括分來，約可分爲：創作準備，通俗文學和雜感之類三部。</p>
<p>本書一開始，作者就忠吿每個文　工作者，在寫作之前，應該首先注意到自身的準備：第一要訓練觀察的能力，要在現實的生活表面，長期努力敎育自已，培養正確的人生和世界觀，觀察之時，頭腦必定要冷靜。高爾基成功的主要條件，就是「見得多」，他在短篇小說「秋夜」前面就註着：「這是一個見得多的人的記錄。」第二藝術作品之所以動人，是因爲裏面有强大的感情，所以一個文藝工作者必須有惑覺一切的能力；感情並不是「感傷」，感傷祗不過是一種於生活有害的織弱的感情罷了，這是沒有價値的。文字由社會為出發點，才能積極促進生活的發展，寫作者要養成強大感情，他必城要從大衆的工作裏，體騐到純正而又偉大的感情。第三描寫能力方面，非得要把握住事物最特徵的形象，加以佈置，然後再正確地表現出來，這是描寫的基本條件。觀察，感覺，描寫三者都是不能超脫現實的，王爾德的唯美主義，因爲游離人生，終於是後在現實之火中，毀滅一盡，他以一爲人生的藝術」代替了「爲藝術的藝術」，無非是因爲他後來在監獄中看到了更深更眞的現實人生他贊美陀斯妥益夫斯基的作品偉大。是由於他的作品中寓有「同情」的成份。文藝作家不單僅爲少數人而寫作的，他的意識範圍貴在能超越自已的階級，再感受到別的階級的思想和情感；這樣他才可獲得廣大的讀者羣，他的作品方可得到祟高的評價。今日的作家，倒底爲誰在寫作呢？Jean-Richard　Bloch說過：「我祇看到兩種可取的態度：「或者離開世界，完全致力於內心的鬥爭，把自我的衝突看作最猛烈最費力，然而是爲堅決的鬥爭；或者他去歡迎他周圍的一個社會，這社會正在改造，再籌，英勇地鬥爭着，充滿了銳氣，燃撓着熱情，超越自己地前進不已，它正需要合乎它步調的詩人，和鼓鼓它進行的節奏。」</p>
<p>從事大衆文學的人，必定要從民衆生活中去尋找題材，和他們接近，了解他們的生活情形和知識程度；再甩「聽得懂的文字」寫出來；「明晰，單純，簡潔」就是託爾斯泰從民問語言中提練出來的精華；高爾基的作品爲各國大衆所歡迎，也就是因他的作風明快又單純，內容方面更在表現被壓迫的痛苦和喜悅，創造與鬥爭。「爲人生的藝術」必須具有同情心；大衆文學並非單在描寫工人或農人，用旁觀者的眼光去哀憐他們；也不是故爲大衆的口氣，訴說生活環境的惡劣，抱怨無窮，垂頭喪氣，就算是個大衆的文學者了。如果他不能對現實表示出積極的態度，對生活的勞動及意志沒有鋼强的鍊銀，對新生活的建設缺少熱誠，對舊傳統的不良的遺產匱乏破壞的力量，他依舊是失敗的——大衆的文學是希望在眞實在變更世界。</p>
<p>本書末後附有「文藝雜惑」之類的短文數請，講到美學，幽默，科學小品，農村文藝等等，雖在編排時缺少一些統整性，但却也是用過一番心血的作品，尤其作者在坦白自述，自已斷了做文學家念頭的時候，充滿了親切而又蒼凉的意味：他說：「我的失敗，原來是由於生活的空虛，自己生活空虛的人，對於他人充實的生活是不會深刻地識認的，當然就難更深刻地表現出來了二……爲了這種覺悟後，我對文學就更其疏淡了」。這幾句話，呌有志文藝的初學者看了，不免有些「英雄氣短」；但牠何當又不是一個有力的警吿，在鼓勵我們應當怎樣急切地需要去充實自已的生活呀！</p>
<p>本書筆法簡明：闡明要義時，常例舉各作家名著加以解釋，所以閱讀起來頗爲輕便；可惜各尊後面未附參考書目，同時幾處引用他人之語時，亦未詳加註明，滬世許不是頂妥善的。</p>
<h3>獨泊漫談</h3>
<p>— 王聰</p>
<p>偶然，在一本小書上看到到一句話，意思是說：「思想好像是女尼，出門時必覆以面紗。」</p>
<p>我由此想起了釋家解釋人的心　爲一面鏡子，一切世俗的名利像灰應似的滿積在心鏡上。久之，這面可貴的鏡子遂失去了牠陝照的能力或作用。</p>
<p>在仳風消沉的今日，物質之狂慾；巳有席捲天下靈魂的模樣。許多光亮的心鏡，都被埋葬在物質以及肉體的污泥裏。</p>
<p>眞正的價値被否定了。（我永不相信眞理會壽終正寢，這只是烏雲之偶蔽太陽而巳。）</p>
<p>思想爲什麼要打扮成一個女尼，並且還要覆上面紗呢？</p>
<p>有人說：</p>
<p>「愛情像暖嗽，不能永遠忍住；讓他雙在喉頭。」自然，這是一個聰明的譬喻。因爲，最聰明的人，也無能掩飾自己的愛情。</p>
<p>對於思想，我亦作如是觀。</p>
<p>因爲牠常常是由於現會處榨所生。雖覆以面紗，我們也無能阻其出門。</p>
<p>有一位哲人說：</p>
<p>「記載我思想的書籍，像一面鏡子。驢頭來看他，絕看不到絕代佳人。」</p>
<p>雖然，這是一句過份矜持的話，然未始沒蘊有眞理在。</p>
<p>中國古書上有見智見仁之說。</p>
<p>角度之不同，時常會使人懷疑眞理。賢哲多命遵陽九，或此故也。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>整肅日本文化戰犯</h3>
<p>— 苞卿</p>
<p>在盟軍佔領當局督促下的日本政府的整肅工作，在年初就準備整肅那些一新聞界中（如報館的總編輯，經理和主筆，新聞編輯等）的問題人物了。而在宣傳方面做過顯要聯務者，也已不准出任官職，並對其直屬近親亦加限制。</p>
<p>如同其他盟國對日管制工作一樣，整肅工作也是進行得緩慢。日本中央整肅委員會到近日才完成言論界戰犯整肅的具體方案的擬訂，即將予以公佈。被整蕭的對象，包括報社，通訊社，電影戲劇關係者，和廣播協會等，於七七至投降這段期間中，製造及支持戰爭之言論的機關。</p>
<p>過去日本整肅那些問題人物的工作，並沒有十分澈底的做，所以有許多戰犯就被逃避了處分。整肅委員會的一些委員們，自身就是有問題人物嫌疑犯的，他們藉口盟軍總部之未規定整蕭限期，及各問題人物在戰時活動的情形，非一時所能調查淸楚，於是一再拖延時間；並且利用整肅打擊彼等之政敵。</p>
<p>現在已在肅淸言論界戰犯了，那些散佈　武思想的傳聲筒，當然需要加以肅淸，而那些在文壇上搖旗吶喊的嘍羅，如像菊池寬，木村毅和丹羽文雄等，在戰時奉承軍閥，今天則歌頌民主，理應由進步文化界予以指斥辨明，以使讀者識其眞相。在整肅文化戰犯中的一部工作，調查戰時新聞記者從事軍事宣傳之活動情形，即將開始，而現任外相蘆田有被整肅之處，已喧傳於三島之外。</p>
<p>蘆田均是日本民主黨黨魁，片山三黨聯立內閣之組成，全賴民主黨的協調，蘆田的助力非淺。故彼之政敵欲以整肅來淸算他，而圖瓦解片山內閣。尤其是蘆　最近發表要求收回千島和琉球的談話，更有被整肅可能。彼在一九三三年至一九四〇時，在英文日本時報，以國際問題專家而任社長兼主筆，在那段侵略我國的時期，發揮其高論，竟有「寸鐵殺人之批評家」。目今高居外相權位，發言要求收回琉球等地及希望盟國减輕賠償，還希冀美國借款了。</p>
<p>我們在期望日本走向民主化的今天，也不得不希望在日本肅淸文化戰犯時，公正的調查，不但是對個人和局部機構，而且要對整個文化機構、作次澈底調查，而作整肅，才算是眞正的達到了文化整肅工作。</p>

<h3>滾燙的一洋山芋</h3>
<p>— 葛春良譯</p>
<p>我有一個朋友，他吿訴我，他曾經在他母親那裏學習到了一個非常非常有價値的教訓。有一天，他母親頜他到廚房中去，放了一只洋山芋在一壼滾燙的沸水中，燒了一會兒，鉗了出來，對我說：「喂，兒子，揑牢！」——就把那隻滾燙的洋山芋丟給了他。</p>
<p>他握在手中　得什麼似的，可是，他的母親卻在哈哈大笑着，同時說：「你不知道應該怎麼辦——是嗎！」</p>
<p>「刻突然我知道了。」我的朋友說寫一我把那滾燙的洋山芋丟還給我的母親，她彷彿有些驚異，他是她接住了仍舊丟在水壼中。然後說：「這可以使你一生中永遠不會忘記這樣的一個教訓。常任何人丟給你一隻滾燙的洋山芋的時候—怎麼辦？丟還給他！」</p>
<p>我的朋友說，起先，好幾年來，他莫明其所以然，雖然，他的母親解釋說，一個「滾燙的洋山芋」是一個難於應付的處境，或是一個難於回答的問題——往往事前不警吿地就給予了你。她說，在你一生中，你會遇到許多聰明人，他們裝聲作啞地會把問題丟過來還給你，自己卻並不回答；你更會遇到許多聰明人，他們會把問題丟給你，然後舒服地坐着，研究你知道些什麼，觀察你如何處置那難題——換句話說，你揑着那只滾燙的洋山芋之後，怎麼辦？或許那只滾燙的洋山芋在你手中「撫摸」得長久了，即使你丟還給他，也巳不燙了—這樣，你吃了他洋山芋的虧。或者，由於你掙扎的情景，使他也懂得了如何可以不燙手地去處置那洋山芋了。</p>
<p>這雖然是一個極平凡的小　事，但是很能够使你印在腦中，並且很耐人尋味的。談起這故事順便使我想起父親常常對我這樣的說：「孩子。假使你記住這句話，你在這個世界上一定可以應付裕如的。當你在發揮言論的時候，你祇不過是在把你所早已知道的時情，重複的再說了一遍罷了——但是，假使你靜聽人家的話，或許你可以學習到一些東西。」</p>
<p>我常注意着一個非常成功的靑年人，他是一個瘦小平靜的人物，自從他離開軍隊生活之後，現在他從幾個大公司和大工廠中可以得到幾百萬元美金呢。在贊事會議中，他遇到問題時，總是巧妙地讓給別人，往往再加上一句討好人家的話：「對這事，你比我知道得多了——你的高見是怎樣？」然後，當會議將結束的時候，那朋友收集了所有最高妙的提議，把嚕　和不適用的淘汰了把精華，提出來，化成他自己的成份，於是把會議室各處丟過來的「滾燙的洋山芋」變成了一份美味的佳餚。</p>
<p>他吿訴我這法子是他在軍隊中從一個下級軍官那裏學習來的，他在會議中總是靜聽着和優美地點着頭的。有問題到他那裏時，他總是謙虛地介紹給他的那些上司，那上司聽了他的誠懇的言論總是覺得很高興。於是到那會議將結束時，每個人是被詢問着是否再有其他的建議時，這個靜默的人會立起來設法說出了一　包含着所有最高妙的意見的言論。</p>
<p>「我學習到了一時　」的重要，」我的朋友說：：「如　的　察着，如何的等待着，如　的研究着，如何的思慮着——一得到了時機，就把那只「滾燙的洋山芋」丟出去。」（自譯六月　　者文摘）</p>

<h3>Receiving Dalian and Lüda Repeatedly Obstructed; We Lodged a Protest with the Soviets; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issued a Public Statement Detailing the Process</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Regarding the obstruction of the reception of Dalian and Lüda, our government has lodged a protest with the Soviet side. (The main points of the protest can be found at the end of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' public statement.) It was delivered by Foreign Minister Wang to Mr. Federin, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy, on the morning of the 25th.</p>
<p>[China News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Mr. Federin, the counselor and Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy, visited Foreign Minister Wang Shijie on the morning of the 25th, had a brief conversation, and then departed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Regarding the progress of the Dalian and Lüda reception issue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following public statement on the 25th:</p>
<p>(1) After the surrender of Japan, in October 1945, when the Chinese government was about to take over the northeast, it decided to send some troops to land in Dalian and first receive the administration of Dalian and Lüda. Unexpectedly, the Soviet government, citing that Dalian was a free commercial port, firmly opposed the Chinese government sending troops to land in Dalian. Therefore, the first step of the Chinese government's reception of Dalian and Lüda administration was obstructed. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance signed in August 1945, Dalian was designated as a free commercial port, which meant that transit goods were exempt from transit taxes. This was unrelated to the stationing of Chinese troops in Dalian. The treaty clearly stipulated that sovereignty and administration of Dalian belonged to China. Except for those expressly stipulated in the treaty, the Chinese administration was not subject to any other restrictions. The treaty did not contain any explicit provisions restricting the entry of Chinese troops into Dalian. Therefore, the Chinese government's dispatch of troops to land in Dalian did not violate the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs then refuted the Soviet view based on the above reasons.</p>
<p>(2) At that time, due to Soviet obstruction, Chinese troops could not be stationed in Dalian, and the reception of Dalian and Lüda administration could not proceed because Dalian and Lüda were still under Soviet military occupation. After the Soviet side refused the Chinese government's troops to land in Dalian, the military strength of the Chinese Communist Party rapidly developed in the vicinity of Dalian and Lüda. The existence and development of this military force also severely hindered the Chinese government's reception of Dalian and Lüda from land.</p>
<p>(3) In March of this year, the Soviet side expressed its hope that the Chinese government would establish its administrative authority in Dalian and Lüda. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated that the reason why the Chinese government has not been able to receive Dalian and Lüda is the above-mentioned two obstacles.</p>
<p>(4) In the past three months, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly negotiated with the Soviet side regarding the reception of Dalian and Lüda. The Soviet side stated that there was no force against the Chinese government in the entire area of the Dalian and Lüshun naval base. The Soviet side guaranteed the safety of the administrative personnel sent by the Chinese government to Dalian and Lüda and that they would be able to freely exercise their functions. The number of armed police officers sent by the Chinese government to Lüshun and their stationing locations should be agreed upon locally by both parties. As for the Chinese government's decision to send troops to station in the Lüshun naval base area, the Soviet government stated that it could not agree because, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the protection of the naval base had been entrusted by the Chinese government to the Soviet government.</p>
<h3>The Sino-Soviet Treaty Did Not Restrict Our Sending Troops to Dalian and Lüda</h3>
<p>Regarding the entry of Chinese military police into Dalian, the Soviet side cited that the state of war against Japan had not ended at that time, and according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, Dalian should still be subject to the military control of the Lüshun naval base area. Therefore, the Soviet government believed that Chinese troops could not enter Dalian at present. China could only send police to Lüshun and Dalian, and the number and stationing locations must be agreed upon by China and the Soviet Union. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that according to the agreement on Lüshunkou in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the entire area of the Lüshun naval base is an area of "joint use" by China and the Soviet Union, and China of course has the right to send troops to the Lüshun military region. Therefore, it expressed its disagreement with the Soviet interpretation that Chinese troops could not be stationed in Lüshun. As for the Chinese army's entry into Dalian, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, Dalian was under the control of the Lüshun military region during the "war against Japan." However, more than a year has passed since Japan surrendered, and the so-called "war against Japan" no longer exists in reality. Even during the "war against Japan," the Sino-Soviet Treaty did not contain any provisions restricting Chinese troops from entering Dalian. The control of Dalian by the Lüshun military region during the "war against Japan" should also be limited to meeting the needs of the joint Sino-Soviet war against Japan. The entry of our army and police into Dalian to maintain the safety of its administration, even during the "war against Japan," should not be seen as hindering the needs of the joint war against Japan. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly expressed its disagreement with the Soviet view in writing and requested the Soviet side to fully understand China's decision to send troops to Dalian and Lüda, because under the current circumstances, the Dalian and Lüda area can be threatened or attacked by forces resisting the government at any time. The Chinese government has the right to send troops under the treaty to ensure the safety and freedom of administrative personnel, and there is also a practical need for this. However, the Soviet side still did not express its agreement.</p>
<p>(5) Our government continued to negotiate with the Soviet side while sending Dong Yanhang and others to Dalian and Lüda to inspect the local situation in preparation for restoring the administrative power of Dalian and Lüda. Regarding the dispatch of personnel for inspection, our side had obtained the prior consent of the Soviet side, and the Soviet side stated that it should provide full assistance to Dong Yanhang and others' inspection so that they could freely perform their inspection tasks. However, after Dong and others arrived in Lüshun, they failed to obtain the assistance promised by the Soviet side and were obstructed by the so-called local administrative institutions, and their inspection mission could not be accomplished. The result of this inspection proves even more that without a sufficient number of Chinese military police stationed in Dalian and Lüda, Chinese administrative personnel will not be able to exercise their functions.</p>
<h3>Our Side Can Implement the Reception of the Administrative Power of Dalian and Lüda at Any Time</h3>
<p>(6) In short, the administration of Dalian and Lüda has not yet been received by the Chinese government: (1) Due to the Soviet government's repeated refusal of Chinese government troops to station in Dalian and Lüda, (2) Because after the Soviet side refused the Chinese government's troops to land in Dalian, the Chinese Communist Party established a large military force near Dalian and Lüda to obstruct the Chinese government's reception. The Chinese government must solemnly call upon the Soviet government to pay attention to the following two provisions stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty: 1. "The Soviet government agrees to provide China with moral, military supplies and other material assistance. This assistance shall be provided entirely to the central government of China, to the National Government." 2. "The Soviet government considers the three northeastern provinces as part of China, reiterates its respect for China's full sovereignty in the three northeastern provinces, and reiterates its recognition of their territorial and administrative integrity." The Chinese government sincerely hopes that the Soviet government will take into account its above-mentioned obligations and not distort the interpretation of matters not explicitly stipulated in the treaty, so as to undermine China's sovereignty and administrative integrity and obstruct the reception of Dalian and Lüda administration. The Chinese government is willing to continue negotiations in a friendly spirit to reach a consensus on each other's views. At the same time, China should solemnly declare that the Chinese government's right to send military police to receive Dalian and Lüda administration is not restricted by any treaty, and the Chinese government can decide to exercise its full power at any time.</p>
<h3>Xu Chuanlin Arrives in Shanghai; Talks About the Situation in Beijing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Xu Fusu arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. When interviewed by reporters, he said: "When attending the State Council meeting in Beijing, many people in the meeting advocated suppressing the Communists, but no decision has been made yet. Under the current situation, I believe that reforming politics and winning people's hearts may be more effective. Regarding the universal suffrage, Chairman Chiang and Chief Secretary Wu Wen both expressed that they will never postpone the election, but the preparations are not very intensive. The proportional election has not yet been decided, and some parties also advocate free elections." The Democratic Socialist Party will hold a Central Standing Committee meeting at 3:00 PM today to discuss the general election and discuss the suggestion of Wu Xianzhang's re-mediation.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Arrives in Beijing; Meets Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>[Foreign Press, Nanjing, 25th] National Government Committee member Song Ziwen arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight at 11:30 AM on the 25th, accompanied by four staff members. After disembarking, Song went to the official residence to meet Chairman Chiang for an audience and had lunch at the official residence. The Chairman inquired of Song.</p>

<h3>The Sino-Soviet Treaty Has Not Been Implemented; Causing General Unease; Dong Xian Guang Speaks at a Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Executive Yuan Information Bureau held a press conference on the afternoon of the 25th. Director Dong answered inquiries as follows:</p>
<p>Question: Vice-Chairman Sun met with reporters from the Central Daily News the other day. Regarding Sino-Soviet relations, he advocated that the Chinese government should protest to the Soviet government. Vice-Chairman Sun also said that he believed that the government had considered this step. Can Director Dong make a statement on behalf of the government?</p>
<p>Question: Does Vice-Chairman Sun's recent conversation with the Sino-American press represent the government's opinion?</p>
<p>Question: Does Vice-Chairman Sun's statement prove that Sino-Soviet relations have deteriorated greatly?</p>
<p>Answer: I cannot speak on behalf of Vice-Chairman Sun. However, Vice-Chairman Sun is extremely friendly to the Soviet Union and strongly advocates that China and the Soviet Union should establish close friendship. This is well known throughout the country. China's more than eight years of war of resistance and the recovery of the northeastern provinces are also its main purposes. China signed a treaty of friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union after Japan declared its unconditional surrender in order to restore China's sovereignty over the northeastern provinces and to lay a permanent foundation for peace in the Far East. This treaty has been concluded for one year and eleven months, and it has not yet been implemented, thus creating a general state of unease and suspicion. Vice-Chairman Sun's expression of his concern about the serious consequences is natural.</p>
<h3>Issue of 50,000 Yuan Bills; Director Dong Says He Has Heard Nothing About It</h3>
<p>Question: Yesterday's Shanghai newspapers reported that the government will issue large bills with a face value of 50,000 yuan. Does Director Dong know anything about this?</p>
<p>Answer: I have not heard anything about this. I don't think the government will issue such large bills.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] It is rumored that the government will issue a suppression order. At the press conference on the afternoon of the 25th, a reporter asked about this. Director Dong replied, "I have not heard anything about it."</p>
<h3>The Information Bureau Opens a Room for Reporters' Entertainment</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Dong Xian Guang, Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, in order to seek closer ties with the press, recently agreed to the reporters' request to allocate the small room used for the bureau's daily news meetings to the reporters as a permanent clubhouse.</p>
<h3>Lin Wei and Huang Zhenqiu Exchange Positions</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Ministry of National Defense recently announced that the Vice Minister of the Ministry, General Lin Wei, and the Deputy Chief of Staff, General Ji Zhenqiu, will exchange positions. It is said that the two will take office in their new positions in the next few days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Bai Chongxi, the Minister of National Defense, will host a luncheon on the 26th for Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei, Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian, Minister of Education Song Jiahuo, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, and the Commanders-in-Chief of the Joint Logistics of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and will also invite Lin Wei, Qin Dechun, and others to accompany him.</p>
<h3>Measures for Announcing Population Statistics</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The Population Bureau of the Ministry of Interior has formulated measures for the national population statistics and the timing of their announcement, that is, the statistics for half a year will be announced separately in January and July each year, and the population number will not be changed during this half year.</p>
<h3>Outer Mongolia's Reply to Our Protest Against the Xinjiang Incident Has Been Delivered; The Content Is the Same as the Soviet Broadcast</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Outer Mongolia's reply to our protest against the Xinjiang incident has been delivered to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is said that the content is generally the same as that broadcast by TASS.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to sources, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs is carefully studying the Soviet reply regarding the Xinjiang incident and will make a second protest. It is said that the letter of protest has been drafted and will be submitted after it is decided.</p>
<h3>An Observer of the International Situation Discusses: American Aid is Not a Problem; Sun Ke's Remarks are Only Personal Opinions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] An observer of the international situation here believes that Sun Ke's two talks with Chinese and foreign reporters are generally valued because Sun Ke is the Vice-Chairman of the National Government. However, before the Kuomintang and the National Government have expressed a decision, Sun Ke's remarks can only be regarded as his personal opinions. He said that regarding the northeast war situation, although the Communist army has an international background, the military authorities of the National Government are confident that they will be able to ensure their strongholds. The Beitashan incident in Xinjiang has no new developments. It can be seen that the Soviet Union may not show up and get involved in the vortex of debate on the Chinese Communist Party issue at this time. It is not a problem for the United States to support the National Government. It is only hoped that the Chinese government itself has a definite policy and a concrete plan for the use and repayment of loans. We can agree with the United States on the timing of the appropriation, and there is no such thing as abandoning China. Therefore, how the Chinese government rectifies politics, stabilizes people's livelihood, and stops the war is a problem for China itself, and there is no need to consider the timing of American loans.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu Discusses with American Businessmen; The Rumored Content Includes Two Points: Allocation of Loans and Other Assistance</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 25th Broadcast: Regarding American foreign economic assistance, Marshall's statement only stated that the State Department is considering possible assistance plans that the US Congress and American taxpayers believe are justified. However, authoritative sources said that the proposals discussed by the US authorities and Ambassador Gu Weijun included two points: (1) Designate the import-export bank loans lent to China before June 30 for immediate allocation, or provide assistance from other aspects. (2) A long-term plan for the construction of railways and industry, funded by the United States with loans totaling one billion yuan. Apart from Ambassador Gu saying that the State Department expressed its sympathy, there are no other decisions. Ambassador Gu told reporters that he hoped the June 30 deadline could be extended.</p>
<h3>American Congressmen Call for Aid to China; Advocate Fundraising to Aid China</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Washington, 24th] Joute, a Republican congressman and member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, recently told the Washington branch of the United China Relief Association that the United States must help the Chinese people for moral, humanitarian and legal reasons. China has been an ally of the United States in the past two wars, and it should receive the assistance of the United States.</p>
<p>裘氏 continued, The American people should not stop helping the Chinese people. He also pointed out that there is a clear difference between donating funds from a friend's point of view to directly benefit the Chinese people and providing assistance through government-led loans.</p>
<p>The United China Relief Association stands on a non-partisan standpoint and allocates the funds raised to several Chinese institutions to train leaders in public health, welfare, medicine, and social work. The Washington branch's fundraising target is 80,000 US dollars. The association is now planning to launch a special donation campaign to make up for the shortfall. The national fundraising target is 8 million US dollars.</p>
<p>Former Ambassador to China Johnson also spoke.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 25th] Gunfire was heard in Peiping again last night. A unit of the Communist army set fire to villages and towns after夜袭ing Panggezhuang and Jiandai鎮. After the National Army arrived, the Communist army fled south. More than 4,000 Communist troops also窜到大小荆帖 and Beixindian near Caiyu鎮. The National Army has dispatched teams to suppress them.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 25th] The security of the outer suburbs of Tianjin has returned to normal. All eight highways in Tianjin County were safely passable on the 24th.</p>

The citizens of Siping learned of the good news of the National Army on the south road and saw the训焰降临 behind the Communist army, believing that the Communist army was about to collapse. Every time the Communist army is defeated, they must set fire to vent their anger.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Military and Political Measures in the SuBei Pacification Zone</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 25th] The seemingly relaxed but actually tense situation in northern Jiangsu is that after the remaining Communist troops lurking in the Funing, Yancheng, Dongtai, and Binhai areas were resupplied with equipment and ammunition transported by the Communist army from Shandong, the work of rural revival in the counties of Yan, Fu, Dong, Xing, and Tai has been greatly affected.

<h3>Former Japanese Kwantung Army Equipment Used by the CCP after Transfer from the Soviet Union; Allotment in Three Phases After Japanese Surrender</h3>
<p>[Hapdong News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] According to reliable semi-official sources on the 25th, the Soviet Union has in fact handed over all military supplies seized from the Japanese Kwantung Army to the CCP forces in the three northeastern provinces, and has even supplied the CCP with its own materials on occasion. It is reported that the CCP forces received a total of 151 aircraft, 155 tanks, 186 armored vehicles, and 787 artillery pieces of various sizes. The Soviet Union's provision of equipment to the CCP was divided into three phases: The first phase was from August 15, 1945, after the Japanese surrender, until April 17, 1946, when the Soviet Union withdrew from the Northeast, and the quantity was small at this time. The second phase was in May 1946, immediately after the CCP's disastrous defeat in Sipingjie, and it is rumored that some pillboxes were included in the materials allotted this time. The third phase was from January 1947 to June 15, and the quantity was the largest this time, enabling the "Democratic United Army" to launch four spring offensives earlier this month and the large-scale fifth offensive this time. Detailed figures for Soviet Union transfer of weapons to the CCP are as follows: (1) 50 fighter planes left by the Japanese army, 40 allotted to the CCP, and 10 retained by the Soviet Union. (2) 50 bombers left by the Japanese army, 39 allotted to the CCP, and 11 retained by the Soviet Union.

<p>Northeastern People Feel Excited After Sun Ke's Speech</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Changchun, 24th] After local newspapers published Vice President Sun's speech to Chinese and foreign reporters, issuing a warning about the new world crisis, the general public was extremely excited, especially the people of the Northeast who had been under enemy puppet rule for fourteen years. Since experiencing the so-called "restoration life" after liberation, it was like injecting a shot of cooling and invigorating medicine into their numb nerves. They recalled the growth of the CCP army in the Northeast and the destruction of the industrial and mining equipment and all construction that had been obtained in exchange for fourteen years of enslaved life. Now, with the flames of war spreading, life and property are constantly threatened. Therefore, rather than coexisting and muddling along with the CCP, they would prefer a clarification of the current situation and unanimously support Sun's speech.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 25th] Regarding Vice President Sun's speech on the new world crisis, this reporter specifically visited Director Xiong at the Executive Headquarters. He received the reporter and said: "I have been in charge of the Northeast takeover for more than a year, and based on my personal experience, I deeply believe that the Chinese Communist Party's reliance on foreign support is ruining our country's lifeline and brewing a third world war. I completely agree with all points of Vice President Sun's speech." In his conversation with the reporter, Director Xiong recalled the difficulties encountered everywhere in the takeover of sovereignty in the Northeast after the Japanese surrender, as well as the fact that most of the weapons seized from the Kwantung Army were used by the CCP forces. He also mentioned with emotion that trained Japanese prisoners and Korean communists are now openly collaborating with the CCP forces in combat.</p>

<h3>Next General Assembly Scheduled for November; Representatives from Various Countries to Go to the Capital Tonight to Meet the Chairman</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held its first meeting at the Hua Lian Hotel starting on the 16th of this month. After nine days, it officially concluded at 1:20 PM yesterday. The committee discussed its final agenda item yesterday, namely the date and location of the next meeting. There was some debate at the time, and it was eventually decided that the next meeting would be held in the second half of November, with the exact date to be determined by the secretariat. As for the venue, due to differing opinions, it was decided to move the decision to the plenary committee meeting of the commission to be held in New York on July 10.</p>
<p>The purpose of this meeting was to plan and organize a United Nations economic organization for Asia and the Far East in order to assist in the economic reconstruction and recovery of Asia and the Far East after the war. The second meeting will discuss the proposals of this general assembly and submit these proposals to the United Nations Economic Committee.</p>
<p>Representatives from ten countries including China, the United States, France, Britain, the Soviet Union, India, the Netherlands, Australia, and the Philippines participated in this conference, along with economic experts from various countries. It was an unprecedented international conference in Asia, and the expenses incurred by the representatives of various countries during their ten-day stay in Shanghai were also astonishing. The cost of just one cocktail party was over several hundred million yuan. With the general assembly concluded, all the representatives are scheduled to go to the capital tonight to meet Chairman Chiang and pay respects to relevant authorities. The Chinese and Filipino representatives will also go to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to lay wreaths and pay their respects.</p>
<h3>Relaxed Debate During Discussion of Date and Location of Next General Assembly</h3>
<p>During yesterday's general assembly discussion of the date of the next meeting, Walden, Secretary-General of the United Nations organization, suggested holding it in late November, so that the secretariat would have sufficient time to complete the heavy workload assigned by the committee, and the committee itself would have sufficient time to prepare a report to submit to the Economic and Social Council. Soviet Representative Styechenko suggested convening it around December 1, while French Representative Molnor suggested November 17. The final decision was to hold it in the second half of November.</p>
<p>When the issue of the meeting venue was raised, representatives from Qian, the Philippines, China, and India all invited the meeting to be held in their respective countries on behalf of their governments, and all guaranteed that the participating representatives would receive various conveniences. Philippine Representative Guaderno also emphasized that the climate in the Philippines is good and transportation is convenient.</p>
<p>Chinese and American Representatives' Apt Analogies</p>
<p>Chinese Representative Li Mu-an likened the meeting venue to a young person showing off, whom everyone wants to woo. The Chinese government also hopes that the next meeting will be held in China again. If the representatives feel that the supply and transportation are convenient this time in Shanghai, they are welcome to hold the next meeting in Shanghai, the metropolis of the East. Moreover, Article 2 of the rules of procedure states that the meeting venue should be held at the office of the United Nations organization. At the same time, the Economic and Social Council has resolved that before the permanent office is decided, it will be temporarily located in Shanghai, so Shanghai can be the venue for the next meeting.</p>
<p>The Soviet representative advocated holding the meeting in India.</p>
<p>Just as this issue was deadlocked, British Representative Crowe suggested handing it over to the plenary committee to discuss further when it meets in Lake Success, New York. Representatives from Britain, Australia, and France all agreed. Davis even changed Li Mu-an's analogy, saying: The meeting venue is not like a young person showing off, but like a young girl showing off, being pursued by a group of admirers. We are very grateful for everyone's enthusiastic welcome, but it would be more appropriate to discuss it at the New York meeting.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet representative strongly opposed, saying: The Soviet representative will not participate in the plenary committee in New York, so they insist that it must be decided at the current meeting.</p>
<p>A final vote was taken, and it passed by a vote of nine to one (Soviet Union) to discuss it at the New York meeting.</p>
<p>The temporary headquarters of the committee will also be temporarily located in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chairman Chiang Ting-fu brought up the resolution passed by the general assembly the day before, which had not been formally processed, and requested that it be formally approved. The Soviet representative stated that this resolution did not satisfy the Soviet delegation, so they abstained from voting, while other representatives believed that the resolution could not completely satisfy all representatives, so they supported its formal passage.</p>
<p>Gratitude to the Chairman and Secretary</p>
<p>Before the closing of the first meeting of the Economic Commission, British Representative Crowe specially thanked Chairman Chiang Ting-fu for leading the meeting, the secretariat for its excellent work in a short period of time, and the Chinese government for its enthusiastic hospitality and all supplies.</p>
<p>Chiang responded by thanking the representatives for their spirit of cooperation and their thoughtful consideration. He said: The Chinese government is very pleased to provide everything for the representatives. Walden thanked all the secretariat staff on behalf of them for the representatives' praise of their work, and stated that there were fewer staff members than any similar meeting, and at the same time, the time was tight, resulting in many shortcomings. In addition, he also thanked the Chinese government for all the conveniences it provided.</p>
<h3>UNRRA China Office Urges Kuomintang and Communist Parties to Cease Military Operations and Expedite Yellow River Levee Restoration</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in This City] The UNRRA China Office recently requested that both the Chinese Kuomintang and Communist parties immediately cease any military operations within the entire Yellow River riverbed and five miles on either side of the levees, so that the levee restoration work can proceed at the highest speed before the end of July. When Cleveland, Director of the UNRRA China Office, issued the above appeal, he also warned both sides that if they do not maintain "a high degree of statesmanship, then the floods in July will breach the levees in one or more places, not only will millions of farmers in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Hebei provinces suffer greatly, but also the parts of the levee restoration work that have been completed will be completely destroyed. Cleveland suggested a cessation of all military operations along the entire Yellow River from Huayuankou downstream, so that the minimum levee restoration work can be completed. It is said that even if both sides issue the order and work together to restore the levees, the annual floods may still come, but if the order to cease military operations is not issued, then UNRRA will be unable to assist in undertaking the necessary levee repair work. The above suggestion was personally delivered by Cleveland to Chief of Staff Chen Cheng and Premier Zhang Qun, and at the same time telegraphed to the UNRRA North China Office for transmission to the highest authorities of the Communist side."</p>
<h3>Major Flood Season Approaching for the Yellow River; Shandong and Henan Hastening Levee Repair</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 25th] The major flood season of the Yellow River will arrive in a month, so the levee restoration project is even more urgent. Now, the government, the CCP, and UNRRA have formed a joint committee dedicated to handling the engineering work in the more complex areas within Shandong Province. UNRRA consultant Todd recently went from here to Cao County to attend the first meeting of the committee. At present, the levee restoration work within Henan Province, except for the Meng County area, where construction is more difficult due to the presence of CCP troops, can be completed on time in other areas as long as there are sufficient materials. The Dasha River within the Wu'an area, which connects to the Yellow River, also needs to be blocked and repaired at the same time. However, the south bank of the river is controlled by the CCP army, so construction is also difficult. The Henan Province Flood Prevention Office here plans to ask the joint committee to find a way to solve the problems that have arisen in the areas where the CCP army is hindering construction.</p>
<h3>Longyan Iron Mine to Resume Operations</h3>
<p>Expediting Repair of Railway Branch Line; Moving Out Stored Iron</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 25th] The Longyan Iron Mine of the National Resources Commission recently received orders to resume operations as soon as possible, and the mine is actively preparing for an early resumption of operations. At the same time, the Pingjin Railway Bureau immediately began work to repair the branch line from Xuanhua to Yantongshan for the mine. The materials for construction, in addition to dismantling the secondary branch lines in various places, can reach Xuanhua and be extended for about five kilometers. For the remaining five kilometers, 32-pound light rails will be used. Once the branch line is repaired, the stored iron in Yantongshan can be transported out first.</p>
<h3>Amendment to Inheritance Tax Law to be Discussed by the Political Affairs Council</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] The draft amendment to the Inheritance Tax Law has been prepared by the responsible authorities and will be discussed and approved by the Political Affairs Council before being sent to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. The Inheritance Tax Law was promulgated and implemented on April 16th last year. According to the provisions of the law, estates with a total value of over one million yuan are subject to taxation, and the tax rate adopts a progressive system. Those over one million yuan are taxed at 2%, those over two million yuan are taxed at 2%, and so on, up to those over ten million yuan, which are taxed at 60%, which is the highest tax rate. Since the law was implemented, due to currency devaluation, the originally set tax threshold of one million yuan has become too low, and taxing those over ten million yuan at 60% is also too high. The threshold for taxation in this amendment has been raised to thirty million yuan, and the tax rate starts at 1%, still using a progressive system, with the maximum amount changed to 30%, in order to achieve fairness and rationality.</p>
<h3>Far East Military Tribunal Adjourns for Six Weeks; Mei Ruan and Others Arrive in Shanghai; To Report to the Capital Within Days; Scheduled to Return to Japan at the End of Next Month</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Mei Ruan, judge of our country's presence on the Far East International Military Tribunal, along with prosecutors Wu Xueyi and Xiang Zhejun, flew from Tokyo to Longhua Airport in this city at 4:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Mei's Remarks</p>
<p>When interviewed by reporters, Mei said: The Far East Military Tribunal has decided to adjourn for six weeks starting from June 27th, until August 4th. This move was in response to the request of all the defendants' lawyers, so that they could make full preparations during this adjournment period. On the other hand, the Far East International Military Tribunal has been continuously in session for fourteen months, and no court in the world has ever been in session for such a long time. All staff members should be tired, and they can also take advantage of the adjournment to take a short break. I have been on leave from the Legislative Yuan for more than a year and a half, and now that the Legislative Yuan is about to be reorganized, I also need to return to the country to report. I plan to go to the capital to report in two or three days. If time and transportation permit, the two prosecutors Wu and Xiang will go to the Southwest to investigate evidence of war crimes. Mei continued: The outside world feels impatient because the trial of war criminals by the Far East Military Tribunal has been delayed for so long, which is understandable. During the trial process, the quality of the various aspects involved and the difficulty of collecting evidence were somewhat unexpected by the judges. The entire history of Japanese military aggression, stretched to ten years, has made the trial situation even more complicated. Before leaving Tokyo, all the judges of the court invited all the defendants' lawyers to discuss how to speed up the proceedings, and the presiding judge also expressed the hope that the trial work could be completed by the end of this year. However, it is still unknown whether this wish can be fulfilled. Moreover, Mei and his party are scheduled to return to Japan at the end of July.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Routine Meeting Decides on This Year's Field Tax Quota</h3>
<p>Two Dou Two Sheng Four Ge Per Yuan</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 25th] In order to reduce the burden on the people, the Jiangsu Provincial Government re-decided on this year's Tianfu (field tax) quota at yesterday's routine meeting. The additional levy was completely abolished, with a levy in kind of one dou six sheng, and a levy in public grain of 40%, totaling two dou two sheng four ge per fu (tax unit). All additional levies are strictly prohibited. The expenses for the levy in kind will be borne by the central government, and the expenses for the levy in currency will be raised locally. The starting date for the levy will be in mid-July for counties levying in currency, and will be determined based on the earliness or lateness of harvests in counties levying in kind.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Cloth Prices Are Low; Rushing Back to Pingjin</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 25th] Northeastern cloth used to be transported out of the Guan (mountain pass/Northeast), but recently, due to the war, the Northeast has experienced low prices and high gold prices. Each piece of Shenyang Da Wufu cloth is only worth 25,000 yuan in circulating currency. Pingjin merchants, seeing the potential for profit, have rushed out of the Guan to return to Pingjin to sell cloth, resulting in a phenomenon of cloth flowing backwards.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Opens Grain Controls; Chengdu Rice Prices Already Trending Downward</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Chengdu, 24th] In order to stabilize the soaring rice prices, the Sichuan Provincial Government, following the request of the provincial and municipal councils, opened grain controls on the 24th, restoring free purchase, and dispatched dozens of inspection vehicles to various counties in the production areas to clear the grain routes and investigate hoarding.

<h3>Australian Minister to China Hosts Reception for Reporters in Shanghai; Expresses Opinions on Policies for Controlling Japan; And Points Out Reasons for Sluggish Sino-Australian Trade</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent] Australian Minister to China Dr. Keith Officer hosted a reception for reporters at 4:30 PM yesterday, expressing his opinions on the Allied policies for controlling Japan, saying: Australia and China are both now concerned that MacArthur's control policies will create an excessively powerful Japan. The British Empire will hold an imperial conference in Australia on August 26th to conduct a thorough discussion of the Japanese peace treaty. Japan's whaling in Antarctica (for news on this matter, please see page 3) and the scheduled opening of private Japanese trade in mid-August were both unilateral decisions made by MacArthur's headquarters. The execution of Japanese reparations should be part of the peace treaty with Japan, and should not be decided by the occupying forces. When discussing commerce between China and Australia, the Australian Minister said that the current sluggishness is due to two reasons: one is that Australia currently has large domestic needs and has no goods to sell, and the other is that it is affected by China's import controls. However, Australia's industry has developed very rapidly during the war, especially the steel industry. Due to its geographic environment and superior management technology, it can now produce the cheapest steel in the world. In the future, wool textiles and steel products will be exported in large quantities. The Sino-Australian immigration issue can also be resolved under the principle of reciprocity.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador Visits Foreign Minister Wang; Issues Statement on Eve of United Nations Anniversary; Tradition of Sino-US Friendship Has Significance for World Peace</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] Ambassador Stuart visited Foreign Minister Wang on the morning of the 25th and had discussions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] US Ambassador Stuart issued a statement to reporters on the 25th on the eve of the United Nations Anniversary. Stuart stated that the long tradition of Sino-US friendship has great significance for postwar world and Pacific peace. He also said that the US "Fulbright Act" is expected to be implemented by the end of this year or early next year. According to the Act, payments from various countries for US surplus materials will be entirely transferred to cultural cooperation projects between those countries and the US. Of this, US$20 million will be used in China, totaling US$1 million per year for twenty years. When applied, this amount will be converted into Chinese currency and used to send American professors and students to China and encourage Americans to study Chinese culture. Stuart expressed his deep sympathy for the Chinese student movement. He said that the main motive of the Chinese student movement is based on patriotism and concern for the government's pursuit of peace. He continued that Chinese students going to the US for further study are feeling overly crowded because US universities are accommodating soldiers. At the same time, the English proficiency of Chinese students is uneven, so the US Consulate General in Shanghai holds English tests for students going to the US, and only those who pass are given visas to avoid wasting the students' time and money. The Ambassador continued to describe the recent situation at Yenching University, saying that Yenching University is experiencing financial difficulties and will reduce the number of faculty and staff in the second half of the year. The reason for the difficulty is that the interest rates on US savings after the war are low, and the income from the endowment fund is very small. US taxes after the war are heavier, and most people are unable to donate.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ting-fu, Walden, and Others to Broadcast in Shanghai Tonight</h3>

<h3>Japan Promotes "Starvation Export" Movement; Our Government Should Seek Countermeasures; Industrial and Commercial Circles Must Not Continue to Produce Shoddy Goods and Invite Their Own Demise</h3>
<p>Jian Guansan's Observations</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 25th] According to Tokyo dispatches, Japanese trade with China is about to open, and Japan is promoting "starvation exports." As Japan was originally the most developed country in light industry, its military may have failed, but its light industry has not failed. Now that it is revitalizing foreign trade, the first country to be affected will be our country, which is lagging behind in industry. Japan has recently had a movement to produce cheap goods, and now there is a "starvation export" movement, which should indeed alert our people. Our country does not oppose Japan's economic adjustment, but it should be subject to appropriate restrictions to avoid hindering our industry and commerce. To cope with this, in addition to the government quickly submitting countermeasures to the Far East Commission, industrial and commercial circles should deeply awaken, change the bad habits of price-increasing competition and shoddy production, so as not to invite their own demise. All sectors should launch a campaign to love and use domestic goods to maintain the weak life of the national industry.</p>

<h3>Measures Planned Internally to Prevent Election Fraud</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The general election is approaching, and in order to prevent election fraud, the Ministry of Interior has drafted a "Method for Preventing and Sanctioning Possible Malpractices in Elections," the main points of which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Illegal handling of elections: Based on experience in elections of provincial, municipal, and county councilors, local administrative authorities, in order to manipulate public opinion or due to collusion with candidates, may illegally handle elections in a way that is unfavorable to certain candidates being elected. This includes (A) forging voter registration lists or election results, (B) not handling election affairs according to legal procedures, such as not announcing the election date within the statutory time limit, or not holding elections on the statutory seven days, or not holding elections in all units and districts simultaneously. Although situation (A) is rare, specific provisions should be made to stipulate penalties. Whether situation (B) is still invalid or valid, or under what circumstances it should be considered valid or invalid, should be clearly stipulated, and penalties should be prescribed.</p>
<p>(2) Ineligible voters: Such as (A) citizens who do not belong to this area participating in voting in this area, (B) those who do not have membership qualifications in vocational groups participating in vocational group elections, (C) impersonating voters, (D) one person having more than two voting rights, who should choose one to participate according to regulations, but instead participate in more than two units. To prevent ineligible voters, a system of public inspection of voter registration lists should be adopted, that is, several days before the election, the voter registration list should be compiled, and the competent election authority of the district or group should prepare a copy and place it in an appropriate place to allow voters to request inspection at any time within a certain number of days and to make copies.</p>
<p>(3) Ineligible candidates: Such as (A) those who have circumstances under Article 6 of the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law, or who are under the statutory age, (B) those whose right to stand for election has been suspended, (C) those who have more than two rights to stand for election and violate the rule of not participating in multiple elections simultaneously. To prevent ineligible candidates, a similar approach to public inspection of voter registration lists should be adopted, allowing voters to raise objections to candidates within a certain number of days before the election. Those who have been determined by a final judgment to be ineligible to stand for election should have their candidate status revoked. Even after the election is announced, if voters or candidates confirm that the elected candidate is not qualified, they may still file a lawsuit within the statutory period. Those who participate in elections in more than two regions and are elected simultaneously should be deemed invalid, and those whose election is ruled invalid should be fined.</p>
<p>(4) Using coercion or violence or other illegal methods to prevent voters from freely exercising their right to vote, or intimidating voters: (A) abducting voters, (B) intimidating voters, (C) using force to coerce voters at the time of voting to exercise their voting rights in a certain way, (D) disrupting the voting with fraud or force, making it impossible to conduct the voting.</p>
<p>Regarding situation (A), it should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the criminal law regarding crimes against freedom. Regarding situation (B), conscription should be temporarily suspended within a certain number of days before and after the election, or imprisonment should be imposed, and their right to vote or to stand for election should be suspended, and those elected should be deemed invalid. Regarding situations (C) and (D), non-voters must be prohibited from entering polling places, and voters must be strictly prohibited from carrying weapons into the polling places. It is also necessary to stop all campaign activities during voting.</p>
<p>(5) Offering wine and meat, loans, positions, or other benefits to bribe voters, promising not to exercise their right to vote or to exercise it in a certain way. Prevention measures: (A) During a certain period before the election, candidates or others are strictly prohibited from holding banquets or giving gifts to voters to solicit votes, and those who violate this should be fined, and candidates who do so should have their candidate status revoked. (B) Specific provisions should be made for Article 143 of the Criminal Law, stipulating the years of suspension of voting rights and the right to stand for election for those who commit violations, and those elected should be deemed invalid.</p>
<p>(6) Secretly investigating election secrets: Such as (A) election officials numbering election ballots or using other symbols, (B) using authority to monitor voters writing ballots, (C) revealing the contents of ballots on behalf of voters. Regarding situation (A), the election should be invalid, and the officials responsible for handling the election and those who direct them should be sentenced to eight months in prison. Prevention methods for (B) and (C) include (i) using fixed candidate methods to replace ballot writing methods, (ii) setting up a number of single-person ballot-writing booths, and appointing people from open areas to serve as substitute examiners, (iii) arriving in the area as late as possible before voting and leaving as soon as possible after the election, (iv) prohibiting specific personnel from communicating with anyone in the area except for necessary official duties, (v) not publicizing their names.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Second Anniversary of the Birth of the United Nations Charter</h3>
<p>Today is the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco. As we commemorate the signing of this historical document, the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is still holding its meeting in Shanghai. We recall that when the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco, it was at the time of the collapse of the Nazis and the intensification of the war against Japan. The birth of this Charter gave people all over the world a beautiful vision for world peace after enduring the suffering of war. The war against Japan had not yet ended at that time, but a new world organization had already emerged in the fog of war. All mankind placed their hopes on this new institution. They knew that the failure of past international organizations lay in their inherent shortcomings. The League of Nations was created at the same time as the Paris Peace Conference, making it inseparable from the peace treaty, and thus it met its doom. The United Nations Charter was born in the suffering of war, expressing an awakening among people all over the world: that mankind must continue to survive in international cooperation, that the order of international society must be maintained, and that the maintenance of this order must be sought through a strong international organization. Two years ago today, when representatives of various countries signed this historic document in San Francisco, the mood of the general public was extremely high. They believed that with this institution, the order of international society would be ensured thereafter. However, the facts that have unfolded in the past two years have inevitably made those who were in high spirits back then feel a sense of disappointment. The cessation of hostilities against Japan is now almost two years past, but the current international order has not yet tended toward stability. Now, on the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, we cannot help but feel a great deal of emotion.</p>
<p>The United Nations organization was created under more suitable conditions than the League of Nations. The failure of the international situation to stabilize in the past two years is a fact, but this is not necessarily related to the United Nations organization itself. The United Nations organization itself has been constantly developing in the past two years, and its internal organization has become increasingly sound. The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East holding its meeting in Shanghai today is enough to show that the United Nations itself is growing and developing every day. In the past two years, at the various meetings of the United Nations organization, representatives of various countries have gathered together to exchange opinions. Although agreements may not necessarily be reached on some major issues, it is already a welcome thing to have this opportunity to present the views of all parties. The world thinks that the use of the veto power by the United Nations Security Council will turn the United Nations organization into a very incapable organization; but we feel that the capability of the United Nations organization does not lie in the provision of the veto power, but in how the veto power is used. From a theoretical interpretation of the Charter's veto provision, we feel that having this provision is not necessarily harmful: the problem lies in how it is actually used. And how it is actually used is unrelated to the United Nations organization itself, and cannot be controlled by the United Nations organization itself. From an organizational point of view, the United Nations organization can indeed be said to be an ideal international organization. The reason why its performance in the past two years has disappointed some people should be sought outside the United Nations organization.</p>
<p>What is the main reason for this: It is the world's abuse of the United Nations. The United Nations organization has not failed to exert its powers and functions. And the abuse of the veto power is a sign of the failure to give the United Nations organization the care it deserves. If this organization is cherished, it will surely be able to develop smoothly and fully exert its due powers and functions. The abuse of the veto power, therefore, has a destructive meaning. However, the core of the problem is still a lack of faith in the United Nations organization; there must be faith in this organization before there can be care for it. The United Nations organization is something that was created. Those who created it must have faith in and care for what they created, and then what was created can grow and develop. What the United Nations organization has encountered is not an inherent shortcoming, but a lack of care and a lack of faith in it. Today, as we commemorate the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, we want to emphasize this point in particular: We must cherish this organization and strengthen our faith in it. Speaking of faith in this organization, we still remember that the Chinese representative who attended the San Francisco conference at that time proposed that China was prepared to give up a part of its sovereignty in order to strengthen this international organization, which shows how deeply we cherish this organization. If all countries could have as much care for this organization as we do, the United Nations organization could exert its power.</p>
<p>If we pursue the question further, we can see that the coordination and international cooperation of the United Nations organization have suddenly become diplomatic rhetoric. The main reason for the failure of international coordination lies in suspicion and distrust. We must eliminate those situations that can cause suspicion and distrust, and there must be an awareness of force and deceit, transforming suspicion into harmony and turning distrust into coordination. The Nazis failed, and the Japanese militarists failed; but today there are still people who want to follow their path to establish world domination. The unrest that appears in various parts of the world is a direct cause of this. We must eliminate this hegemonic doctrine of world domination, and then there can be true international cooperation. The so-called abuse of the veto power also stems from this. Only when there can be full cooperation among nations can international organizations like the United Nations exert their power. Now, on the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco, we call for closer cooperation among nations.</p>

<h3>Leaders of Four Powers to Broadcast Today on Second Anniversary of Signing of United Nations Charter. Stalin Refuses to Participate for Unclear Reasons.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 24th] Marshal Stalin has refused an invitation to participate in a broadcast program by other leaders on the anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter on June 26. The United Nations Radio and the American Broadcasting Corporation have agreed to allocate half an hour on that day to broadcast talks by Chinese Chairman Chiang, American President Truman, British Prime Minister Attlee, French Premier Reynaud, Belgian Prime Minister Spaak, and United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie. Stalin's refusal to participate did not specify a reason.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 24th, Associated Press] The United Nations announced that U.S. Secretary of State Marshall will pay an informal visit to the United Nations headquarters on the 26th to attend the second anniversary ceremony of the signing of the United Nations Charter. Both the U.S. government and United Nations officials solemnly stated that Secretary Marshall's first visit to the United Nations has "absolutely no special mission." It was also announced that Stalin has notified the United Nations that he will not participate in the broadcast by the other four power leaders to celebrate the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter. The notification was delivered to the United Nations by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko. U.S. President Truman, British Prime Minister Attlee, Chairman Chiang, and French Premier Reynaud, upon receiving Stalin's refusal to deliver a broadcast speech, have agreed to broadcast their own recordings on the anniversary of the Charter. Officials from the United Nations Broadcasting Team stated that they will broadcast to the world in twenty-one languages as originally planned.</p>
<h3>Review of Work Over the Past Two Years</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 25th] As the second anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter approaches, representatives of various countries generally acknowledge that the success or failure of the United Nations organization depends on the member states themselves, especially the five major powers of China, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Currently, there are no signs of any country withdrawing. However, the general consensus is that the United Nations organization is still in its infancy and is not up to the task of an adult. Two years ago, on June 26, the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco by fifty countries, with a place reserved for Poland. Membership has now increased to fifty-five countries, and other countries are still applying for membership. The United Nations has had active achievements and many setbacks in the past two years. Records of vetoes and continued disputes. The Security Council has discussed a variety of issues, including the Iranian issue, the Syrian and Lebanese issue, the Indonesian issue, the Spanish incident, and three cases involving Greece and the Balkans. The processing records show that the Soviet Union has withdrawn its troops from Iran, and British and French troops have also withdrawn from Syria and Lebanon. The Balkan investigation team has conducted on-the-spot investigations. The Indonesian issue was not submitted for discussion because the Netherlands regarded it as an internal affair, and the Spanish issue was temporarily put on hold because the United Nations organization was busy dealing with the Palestinian issue. In the social and economic spheres, dozens of conscientious representatives have spent a great deal of time trying to find ways to save the world from poverty, and their work is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Few Achievements</p>
<p>United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie recently delivered a speech stating that the United Nations organization is a "growing organization." Lie pointed out that the disputes among the five major powers remain the greatest difficulty hindering the United Nations organization in the past two years. The embers of war still exist, important peace treaties have not been signed, and disputes continue unabated, which will have repercussions in the discussions of various United Nations agencies and will delay and complicate the world's reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p>Organizational Overview</p>
<p>The organization of the United Nations organization is becoming increasingly complex. The center of the organization is six bodies, namely (1) the "General Assembly," which has held three sessions and is scheduled to hold its fourth session this fall, with the Palestinian issue at the top of the agenda. (2) The "Security Council" is a watchdog for peace and meets at least once a week, being the most powerful agency of the United Nations organization. The General Assembly only has the power to make recommendations, while the Security Council has the power to enforce resolutions. (3) The "Economic and Social Council" has met four times and is formulating extensive plans to eliminate social and economic ills around the world, and will meet again in July. (4) The "Trusteeship Council" This council was established the latest and held a meeting once in March this year. (5) The "International Court of Justice" has always been located in The Hague. The Security Council has entrusted it with the British and Albanian mine dispute case. (6) The "Secretariat" is headed by Norwegian representative Trygve Lie as Secretary-General, with a term of five years, starting in 1946, with an annual salary of US$20,000 plus an office expense of US$20,000, with 2,600 employees. The budget for 1946 was over US$19 million, and the budget for 1947 was over US$27 million. In addition, a permanent headquarters is under construction. The cost is enormous.</p>
<h3>Holy Land Investigation Team Has Contacted Jewish Groups</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Jerusalem, 25th] According to news received here, the United Nations Palestine Investigation Committee has contacted Jewish terrorist elements. The chairman of the committee, Ster Strom, and committee member Hu Shize have contacted Jewish groups in Tel Aviv and stayed there anonymously overnight.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Gaza, 24th] When the United Nations Palestine Investigation Team arrived in Gaza by car from Jerusalem today, 30,000 Jewish residents kept their doors closed. The 54,000 Muslims and Christians of the Arab population also seemed disinterested. Only the Mayor of Gaza formally welcomed the thirty-car convoy of the investigation team, with very few onlookers. The boycott of the Palestinian Arab Higher Executive Committee seems to be strictly enforced.</p>
<h3>Secretary Marshall to Deliver Speech Explaining U.S. Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] The State Department recently announced that Secretary of State Marshall will deliver a speech at the Governors' Conference in Salt Lake City on July 14. According to political sources, since July 14th is the French National Day, Marshal Marshall will likely explain the Truman Doctrine, U.S. foreign policy, and the aid plan he himself proposed.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aid to Europe Plan is a Product of Enlightened Policy</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall's plan for European economic recovery is to promote the enlightened doctrine of self-interest and is an effort to find practical ways to assist European industry. The plan is based on the principle of the United States helping Europe to avoid a major disaster in the future, and calls for the following steps: First, European countries that adopt the plan should join a joint plan for economic cooperation. These countries will provide resources, break down economic barriers, and receive the materials they need based on continental principles. Secondly, they should develop a plan outlining the foreign aid needed so that the United States can review this plan with reference to its own strength. Finally, the United States Congress should decide on the amount of aid to be provided by the United States and how to provide it.</p>
<h3>Revival of West Germany Should Be the Foundation of U.S. Aid to Europe</h3>
<p>Secretary Marshall Emphasizes This Point in Letter to Bevin</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] "The Yorkshire Post" reported today that U.S. Secretary of State Marshall wrote to British Foreign Secretary Bevin stating that the revival of West Germany must be the foundation of the U.S. aid to Europe plan.</p>
<h3>Poland Willing to Cooperate with Other Countries to Implement Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] The Polish Ambassador to the United States, Winiewicz, told the new U.S. Undersecretary of State Lovett today that Poland will cooperate with other European countries to implement the plan for aiding European economic recovery proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall. Poland is ready to participate in drafting the European reconstruction plan. Poland is currently encountering numerous economic difficulties and needs U.S. economic assistance.</p>
<h3>Britain Emphasizes the German Question; Memorandum on Germany Being Drafted; Foreign Secretary Bevin to Take It to Paris</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 25th] After two discussions between Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Under Secretary of State Clayton, it was decided that he will fly to Paris tomorrow to meet with French Foreign Minister Bidault and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov this Friday. They will discuss the best way for Europe to adapt to U.S. Secretary of State Marshall's European Recovery Program and will suggest convening a conference of European nations as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Authoritative sources here revealed today that Foreign Secretary Bevin will bring a specially prepared memorandum on Germany's place in the Marshall Plan when he departs for the three-country talks in Paris. After receiving notification of Molotov's agreement to participate in the three-country talks, Bevin immediately instructed Air Marshal Douglas, Commander of the British Zone in Germany, to prepare an analytical report on the relationship between the German problem and the overall European post-war recovery problem. This plan is still being drafted in Berlin. Observers believe that the German question will be the most delicate and promising issue at the Paris talks. Although the German economic problem must be revisited during a detailed study of the Marshall Plan, the large-scale U.S. assistance now anticipated may reduce the severity of Soviet demands for reparations from Germany.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 24th] Diplomatic observers here commented that U.S. Secretary of State Marshall's proposal concerns economic recovery, and the United States cannot stand aloof from this because one-fourth of Germany's territory is currently controlled by U.S. occupation forces; thus, the United States is also a European nation.</p>
<h3>Molotov to Fly to France Today for Three Foreign Ministers Conference in Paris; Clayton May Attend as Observer</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has informed the French government that he is scheduled to fly to Paris on Thursday morning to participate in the discussion of the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] According to reliable sources, the Three Foreign Ministers Conference may be kept confidential, with only a brief statement to the press each day. However, the procedures for this matter will be decided by the three foreign ministers themselves.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] According to well-informed sources, Clayton may travel to Paris on the 27th to attend the Three Foreign Ministers Conference on the Marshall Plan as an observer.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] France is pleased that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov accepted the invitation to attend the Three Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan and is even more gratified that the Soviet Union has not imposed any restrictions on the scope of the discussion. According to well-informed sources, it is highly likely that the British, Soviet, and French foreign ministers will temporarily avoid discussing fundamental issues (i.e., the actual distribution of U.S. aid) when they meet on the 27th and will only exchange general views. If the three foreign ministers were to immediately begin dealing with this issue in detail, it would not only be premature but also sufficient to provoke various political issues on which agreements have not yet been reached. If, as rumored, the United Kingdom and the United States want to give priority to western Germany, which is under British and American occupation and the nerve center of continental Europe, then France will likely express dissent on the grounds of security. The Soviet side believes that countries whose current difficulties were caused by German aggression should be given priority for aid. This view may receive sympathy from the French government. However, one thing we must understand is that local and national interests must be subordinated to the overall interests of continental Europe. The primary task of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference will be to determine the method for formulating the European Recovery Program. France has already notified the U.S. government that it supports the establishment of a special committee. According to responsible sources, this is the initial response. The three foreign ministers must be open-minded and discuss the entire issue together in Paris.</p>
<p>U.S. Attention Focused on Soviet Attitude</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 24th] It was learned today that although Secretary of State Marshall has flatly denied that the United States is taking an active role in the future of European economic recovery, the United States will still be forced to participate. This is because the United States' power in Europe not only controls the U.S. occupation zone in Germany but also cooperates economically with the British occupation zone in western Germany. The State Department's course of action depends largely on the Soviet Union's attitude toward the Marshall Plan for European economic recovery. If the Soviet Union is willing to cooperate, the United States may be more inclined to maintain a strictly detached position. Conversely, the United States will inevitably begin to organize a Western European economic group, and the United States will be either forced or willing to assume the supreme task of leading Europe. The Soviet Union's agreement to participate in the British, French, and Soviet three-country conference is considered here to be an encouraging sign.</p>
<h3>U.S. House Military Affairs Committee Passes Bill on Sending Military Missions</h3>
<p>[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 24th] The U.S. House Military Affairs Committee passed a bill today that provides detailed regulations on the issue of the United States sending military and naval missions abroad. Currently, the United States has such missions in China and Iran. The bill authorizes the President, in peacetime, to exercise wartime powers to send such missions to foreign governments at their request and under conditions deemed beneficial to the nation by the President. Secretary of State Marshall previously expressed support for this bill, stating that these missions are advisory groups and should not be regarded as combat units or expeditionary forces.</p>
<h3>President Truman, Responding to Labor, Criticizes the New Labor Law; 200,000 U.S. Coal Miners on Strike</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 25th] President Truman today led the government in responding to labor's criticism of the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, while the press supported Congress and urged the President to "do his duty" and sign the bill. Officials of the New York State Labor Mediation Board also echoed the President's position this afternoon, condemning the bill as "impractical."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] Democratic Congressman Lesinski introduced a bill in the House of Representatives today to repeal the labor bill proposed by Taft and Hartley. This bill will be submitted to the Labor Committee for discussion.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] The U.S. coal miners' strike is expanding. According to responsible sources, an estimated 200,000 workers had stopped working by this afternoon, which will reduce daily coal production by 500,000 tons. Mine owners have also indicated that they may be forced to close the mines tomorrow. John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers of America, and other union leaders have remained silent today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 24th] Representatives of the bituminous coal mining industry in Washington estimate that at least half of the bituminous coal miners nationwide have begun a slowdown, which may inevitably expand into a full-scale coal miners' strike. In addition, workers in the construction and livestock industries have also slowed down to protest the new labor law. 12,000 workers at Brooklyn, New York, and New Jersey shipyards have also decided to stage a protest strike tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest Spreads in France in Protest of Fiscal Bill</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] The French General Confederation of Labor recently issued a statement expressing disagreement with the fiscal bill recently passed by the National Assembly, saying that this bill will increase the burden on the working class.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] The miners' strike in northern France is spreading today. It is reported that 30,000 workers in Lille have stopped working, which is a quarter of the workers in the area. The bank workers' strike in Paris has not yet been resolved and has lasted five days.

This is the first agreement signed by the United States with these countries under the $350 million relief act for China and six European nations. Austria formally agreed not to transfer relief materials to the Soviet Union or other occupying forces. According to State Department officials, 23 ships carrying food, clothing, medicine, and other necessities will depart from U.S. ports before the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Field Marshal Montgomery Flies to Australia; Met with Indian Officials on Defense Matters</h3>

<h3>Implementation of Constitutional Government Relies on Support of Public Opinion; Journalists Association Resolves to Petition Government to Increase Number of Reporter Representatives in National Assembly</h3>
<p>The city's Journalists Association held a meeting of its executive directors yesterday. The executive supervisors and the group leaders of the administrative, organizational, research, and benefit groups of the board of directors also attended. After each group leader reported on association affairs, the following important matters were resolved: (1) Approval of the list of new members; (2) Petitioning the Ministries of Interior and Social Affairs to increase, as much as possible, the number of representatives that journalistic organizations should elect from within the total number of National Assembly representatives from occupational groups. The original wording of the petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>"It is noted that the number of National Assembly representatives from national occupational groups has been explicitly stipulated by the National Government in Article 4, Paragraph 6 of the 'Regulations on the Election of National Assembly Representatives After the Promulgation of the Constitution' promulgated on March 31 of this year: 'Four hundred and fifty are to be elected from occupational groups.' The same article also stipulates that 'the allocation of quotas for each of the preceding items will be determined by law separately.' Recently, it has been learned that the method for allocating the number of National Assembly representatives from occupational groups has been jointly drafted by your ministry and the Ministry of Social Affairs (Interior), in which the number of representatives from journalistic organizations is even less than that of the First National Assembly. Upon hearing this, the colleagues of this association were extremely astonished. Since the victory, the national news industry has developed rapidly, and the number of journalists in various places has increased several times compared with before the war. Therefore, in terms of the increase in the number of journalists, the number of representatives to be elected to this National Assembly should also be greater than that of the First National Assembly. In addition, the implementation of democratic constitutional government relies heavily on the support of public opinion. After the implementation of constitutional government, the position of journalists is obviously more important than before the war. The number of National Assembly representatives to be elected by them must be increased within the total number of occupational groups, in order to show the government's emphasis on the news industry and freedom of speech. In view of this, the colleagues of this association, after a meeting of the executive directors, decided to submit a petition to your ministry and the Ministry of Social Affairs (Interior) to properly regulate the allocation of the number of National Assembly representatives from occupational groups so that journalists across the country can elect a reasonable number of representatives in accordance with the law to attend the Constitutional National Assembly, exercise political power, and jointly seek the implementation and promotion of democratic constitutional government, in order to meet the ardent expectations of the people of the country."</p>

<h3>Verdict in Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor Drowning Case: Second Landlord and Wife Sentenced to Seven Months Imprisonment Each</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The widely publicized case of the second landlord, Shao Kunshan, forcing the death of tenant Zheng Zongjing, was concluded yesterday morning in the Ninth Criminal Court of the District Court by Judge Zhu Qinghuang. The case arose because Zheng Zongjing, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor, rented the bottom floor of No. 12, Lane 330, Xizang Road, to practice medicine. Shao Kunshan and his wife, Lu, had a quarrel with him, leading to poor relations. Shao Kunshan closed the main gate, preventing patients from entering for treatment, and pressured Zheng to move out. Zheng, under stimulation, left on the afternoon of March 21 and never returned. The next day, it was discovered that Zheng had drowned in the Huangpu River. The District Prosecutor's Office prosecuted for the crime of obstructing freedom. Yesterday, the District Court ruled that Shao Kunshan and Shao Lu were jointly guilty of violence and obstructing the exercise of rights and were each sentenced to seven months in prison. The defendants were taken into custody after the verdict.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union's Expansionist Ambitions: Related to Communist Rampage; American Journalists Hosted Reporters Yesterday: Discussing the International Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The American newspaper tycoons, who arrived in Shanghai on a Pan American company round-the-world flight, hosted reporters from the city yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the conference hall on the second floor of the Capital Hotel. The American newspaper representatives attending were: Fred S. Ferguson, publisher of International News Service; Paul Patterson, publisher of the Baltimore Sun; Frank Gannett, publisher of the Gannett newspaper group; John S. Knight, publisher of the Minneapolis Star-Journal and Tribune; Leonard K. Nicholson, publisher of the New Orleans Times-Picayune; Erwin D. Canham, editor of the Christian Science Monitor; Helen Rogers Reid, publisher of the New York Herald Tribune; and Oveta Culp Hobby, publisher of the Houston Post. They answered questions about Sino-American relations and the international situation, respectively. (1) On the issue of loans to China, Fred Ferguson of INS stated: "The American people are generally headache over any loans; however, Americans generally sympathize with China, so China should have priority." Frank Gannett of the Rochester newspapers stated: "The world often misunderstands that the United States has sufficient power to arbitrarily help other countries, but in fact, we cannot create something from nothing. The source of loans is nothing more than increasing taxes and issuing banknotes, and both are harmful, so they must be taken seriously." Erwin Canham of the Christian Science Monitor expressed his personal opinion on the recent remarks of Vice President Sun of the National Government, stating: "The United States' assistance to China is not only in the economic and political aspects but is also broadly assisting in domestic welfare construction to make itself strong and prevent the expansion of the Soviet Union." He believes that the Soviet Union's expansionist ambitions are "intertwined" with the Communist Party's arrogance. (2) On the issue of America's attitude towards China, John Knight of the Minneapolis Star stated: "Americans generally hold a friendly attitude towards China. Marshall's statement when leaving China is largely sufficient to represent the thoughts of the general American people, hoping that China can stop the internal strife and unite." (3) Regarding the future of the United Nations organization, Frank Gannett of the Rochester newspaper believed that whether the United Nations can succeed can be summed up in one sentence: it depends on the attitude of the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union is willing to compromise, there is hope for success. Although the Soviet Union has already accepted Marshall's proposal for European recovery, in light of past events, it cannot give people extravagant hope. Although we very much hope that the plan will be successful to unify the European economy and solve the current difficulties. John Knight of the Minneapolis Star expressed: "I am quite skeptical of the value of the United Nations, unless the Soviet Union abandons the veto power, otherwise even revising the charter is useless." (4) Regarding the issue of freedom of speech, the reporters all denied that freedom of speech in the United States has been threatened. They believe that if freedom of speech is suppressed in China, the situation will become even worse. In addition, the reporters all expressed their utmost pleasure for this trip to Shanghai and Jinan, and Mrs. Reid and Mrs. Hobby hope to learn more about China so that they can find ways to assist after returning to the United States.</p>
<h3>Howard on Japan's Inability to Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American newspaper magnate Howard told reporters that Chairman Chiang is a true patriot, dedicated to improving the lives of the people and building democracy. China is still far from the goal of democracy, but the development process of democracy is inherently slow. Regarding possible American loans, he noted that China had wasted too much on loans in the past. If it wants new loans in the future, it must have a plan for their use and must have American personnel to monitor their use, only then will the loan have a chance of success. When asked about his views on the Far East situation, Howard believed that the Soviet Union's ambitions in the Far East, its past history, and the current situation in Northeast China all illustrate this. It is very difficult for the United States to counter this kind of expansion because the United States cannot start World War III. To make the Soviet Union respect treaties, it is naive to think that diplomatic pressure can make the Soviet Union yield.</p>
<p>The Soviet government is now propagandizing to its people at home that the United States is weakening, reminiscent of the domestic propaganda of Germany and Japan before World War II. In fact, even during the war, the Soviet government removed the trademarks on Lend-Lease materials and told its people that these American-supplied planes, tanks, and trucks were made in their own country. Of course, the Soviet army's heroic sacrifices are worthy of admiration, but without American material assistance, it would undoubtedly have failed. All Soviet politics are decided by the fourteen members of the Politburo, and the people know nothing about the international situation, allowing themselves to be led by the nose. I dare to make a bold prediction that although the United States does not want to go to war, if the situation continues to develop in this way, the United States will one day be forced to go to war, just like the Marco Polo Bridge Incident for China and the Pearl Harbor Incident for the United States. Regarding the</p>
<p>issue of controlling Japan, when reporters told him that the people of the country could not sympathize with MacArthur's policies, Howard did not quite agree, believing that MacArthur's control policies were extremely wise. Such achievements in two years could only be achieved by a political genius. His being selected as the first of the world's top ten greatest people is no accident. Japan's military and industrial potential has now been completely destroyed. As for supporting its industry and allowing it to fish, this is a practical necessity. The United States cannot afford to support Japan for a long time, just as China cannot afford to supply Japan with food for a long time. However, it cannot allow it to starve, so it is right to help it recover. As for fearing Japan's resurgence, China need not worry too much, because on the one hand, Japan's losses in the war are rare in modern history, and on the other hand, the United States suffered no less from Japan in the war than China. Strict supervision in the future is a matter of course. I have visited Japan several times after the war, so what I say has a basis.</p>
<h3>America Clipper Continues Flight to Tokyo This Morning</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The American company's America Clipper, a global flight, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and will leave Shanghai at 7:00 AM this morning to continue its flight to Tokyo. The plane has already been filled with 3,000 gallons of oil by Texaco in Shanghai, and the mechanical personnel of China Airlines have carefully inspected the parts, engines, etc., to prepare for completing the second half of the round-the-world flight. The American newspaper tycoon Howard, who traveled around the world on the plane, was warmly welcomed by all walks of life upon arriving in Shanghai. Last night at 6:00 PM, American Consul Davis held a grand cocktail party at his private residence at 1082 Lin Sen West Road, and at 8:00 PM, Mayor Wu hosted a banquet at his official residence at 201 Anfu Road, with Chinese and foreign dignitaries gathering together, making it a grand occasion. Howard and others will leave Shanghai this morning, and it is reported that they are taking with them a lot of information about the current situation in our country.</p>
<p>[Another report] According to the president of American Airlines, Che Li Bo, told reporters: The American global route was originally intended to have Shanghai as a central station, but due to the current difficulty in remitting foreign exchange, it will not pass through Shanghai for the time being. However, he believes that Shanghai will be included in the near future. The global flight is tentatively scheduled once a week, flying east and west, with Calcutta as the center. After that, it will gradually develop, planning to increase to three times a week, and hoping to have one flight every day by next year.</p>

<h3>Students from Four Universities in Wuhan Organize a Rural Inspection Group</h3>

<h3>Aurora University Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday, Mayor Wu Attended and Gave a Speech</h3>
<p>The private Aurora University in this city held its graduation ceremony at 9:00 AM yesterday in the university's auditorium. More than 100 people attended, including Mayor Wu, Bishop Hui, Dean Fang, and the French Consul General. First, President Hu gave a speech, encouraging graduates to maintain reason and serve the country. Then, Mayor Wu gave a speech, praising the excellent academic style of Aurora University and detailing the government's painstaking efforts in handling the student unrest. He mentioned that the government had obtained detailed information in advance about the steps taken by the communist personnel remaining in Shanghai to instigate strikes, class boycotts, and market strikes. At first, it did not fully believe it, but later all of them were realized one by one. At this time, if the government waited for the chaos to take shape before forcibly suppressing it, the great losses suffered by the city could be imagined. Therefore, it had to take precautions. However, the arrested students were given all kinds of preferential treatment to ensure that their living arrangements were better than those at school. Once the danger was reduced, they were released. Even those with conclusive evidence were not detained for long. This proves the government's intention to protect young people, and it is hoped that young people will understand. In contrast, the cruel punishments suffered by the arrested people in the so-called liberated areas cannot be compared. Finally, Mayor Wu encouraged the students to abide by the law, love the country, and believe in the truth, saying that democracy is glorified by abiding by the law, patriotism is the foundation of life, and young people who are unwilling to believe in the truth violate the spirit of our country's five thousand years of history. During the Mayor's speech, he elaborated and used metaphors, not shying away from detail, and the listeners were moved. Then, students from the medical school and other schools took oaths to receive their diplomas. A total of 29 graduating students from the medical school were approved to graduate, including Shi Jixiang and 21 others. A total of 19 graduating students from the law school were approved to graduate, including Xia Bingheng and 17 others; a total of 29 graduating students from the science and engineering school were approved to graduate, including Hua Renwen and 27 others; a total of 29 graduating students from the women's liberal arts school were approved to graduate, including Zhao Liwen and others, totaling 94 graduating students. The ceremony ended at 11:30 AM.</p>

(2) The appointment of teachers in various subjects should be based on regulations. The initial appointment should be for one academic year in principle, and the renewal appointment should be for two academic years. (3) The number of teaching hours for full-time teachers in various subjects should be determined according to the complexity of the homework and practice in each subject.

(5) The fees collected from students by various schools should comply with regulations and should not be collected under false pretenses or excessively.

<h3>Public and Private Secondary Schools in This City Were Ordered by the Ministry of Education to Improve Separately, and Principal Tao Guangchuan of Jingye Middle School Was Commended by Order</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent supervisors to Shanghai to inspect secondary education, and the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education has been notified based on the inspection report. The main points of the original order are as follows: (1) A small number of municipal schools have only one building, which is not only insufficient for classrooms but also has a small address and no place for extracurricular activities. The school buildings of private schools are mostly dilapidated and even more unsuitable, which has a great impact on the physical and mental development of students. The Bureau's plan to build secondary education districts should be gradually realized. (2) The equipment of municipal middle schools is mostly simple and should be planned in detail by the Bureau and enriched in stages. Schools with a long history and outstanding performance should be given priority to enrichment to show encouragement. (3) The number of public and private secondary schools in the city has reached a considerable number, and in the future, efforts should be devoted to the equipment of normal schools and vocational schools. The establishment of middle schools should be temporarily slowed down. (4) A small number of administrative personnel in charge of public and private secondary schools are unable to familiarize themselves with the current secondary education laws and regulations. The Bureau should distribute abstracts to each school separately for compliance. (5) Private secondary schools shall not concurrently run elementary schools. Those who have established elementary schools should be ordered to set up separate school sites. Registered private schools should be strengthened in supervision and gradually reach a considerable level according to their equipment and teachers. Unregistered private schools should be urged to improve, and those that are poorly run should be banned. (6) A small number of teachers in public and private middle schools are still not serious about marking students' textbooks. The personnel in charge of student discipline in various schools are also mostly unable to guide students' daily habits well. When teachers are absent for reasons, it is rare to see supplementary lessons or other remedial measures. These are all inappropriate and should be supervised and improved by the Bureau of Education. (7) The school boards of private secondary schools mostly do not ask about the school's various income and expenditure situations, and the school's economic audit committees are mostly in name only. The Bureau should order the school boards of each school to effectively handle them, or order each school to follow the example of the private Nanyang Middle School and hire an accountant to review the accounts at the end of each semester by the school board and report the audit opinions for review. (8) Tao Guangchuan, principal of Jingye Middle School, Cheng Kuanzheng, principal of Wusong Middle School, Cui Jianwu, principal of Daozhong Girls' Middle School, and Shen Jun, principal of Yunzhong Girls' Middle School, are enthusiastic about running schools, diligent, and practical. Yu Liwen, director of the junior high school department of the private Zhaohe Middle School, is diligent in his service. Zhu Guanlu, a Chinese teacher at the Municipal Xinlu Normal School, Jia Bingru, a science teacher at the private Nanyang Model Middle School, Wu Youfen, an English teacher at the private Peiming Girls' Middle School, and Chu Shaotang, a geography teacher at the private Xiaoguang Middle School, have good teaching methods and are worthy of observation. They should be commended separately by order.</p>

<h3>Ping Pong League Finals Begin: Shanghai Star Faces Hualianhua in First Battle Tonight at 8:00 PM in the Central Assembly Hall</h3>
<p>The champions and runners-up of the various divisions of the second Shanghai Ping Pong League, organized by the Municipal Sports Association's Ping Pong Committee, have already been determined. The first final battle of the top eight teams will be held tonight (the 26th) starting at 8:00 PM at the Central Assembly Hall of the Jingwu Association near the Yokohama Bridge.

Chen Linsheng and Shen Bohong will be the referees, and Hu Shousheng will be the recorder. Admission is free, and visitors are requested to maintain order.</p>
<p>Shanghai Star was the champion of the Jinliang Cup last year. A few months ago, it traveled to Hong Kong and Macau, achieving seven wins and two losses, returning with a good reputation. This year, its strength has been significantly weakened due to its main player, Wang Youxin, working for the Jingwu Association. In the nine matches of the first division, it was slightly less impressive because veteran Lu Hanjun went to Hong Kong to do business, and Wang Changhou was sick and Huang Zhijun's skills deteriorated. Fortunately, due to the efforts of the four knights Xue Xuchu, Fu Qifang, Li Zongpei, and Yu Cheng, it was still able to win the first division. Hualianhua is unfortunately facing a strong opponent in its first match, and defeat is undoubtedly inevitable. However, with everyone working together, it should be able to put up a tenacious resistance against Shanghai Star. The lineups of both teams are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Shanghai Star) Ying Yaokang (Leader), Xue Xuchu (Captain), Fu Qifang, Li Zongpei, Yu Cheng, Cheng Aixin, Huang Gaoyuan, Huang Zhijun, Huang Zhisong.</p>

<h3>The International Monetary Fund Opposes Buying and Selling Gold at Unfair Prices, Recommending Member States Take Effective Action to Stop Transactions</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 24th: The International Monetary Fund has requested that all member states take immediate action to stop gold transactions that exceed the gold price or exchange rate registered with the Fund. A statement issued by the Fund today said that the International Monetary Fund has considered international gold transactions around the world that exceed the registered value. Due to the importance of this matter, the Fund is preparing the following statement to express its views. The main purpose of the Fund is to stabilize world exchange rates. The Fund believes that continuing to buy or sell gold at prices that directly or indirectly cause the devaluation of foreign exchange transactions is sufficient to undermine the stability of exchange rates. Based on the information it has obtained, the Society believes that if it is not stopped, the aforementioned activities will become more and more extensive, and the exchange rate relations between the member states will be disrupted. Moreover, as a result of these transactions, most of the gold is in the hands of private individuals and is not concentrated in central institutions, so that monetary reserves are gradually reduced. For this reason, the Society strongly opposes engaging in international gold transactions at unfair prices. It also recommends that member states take effective action to stop such transactions with other countries or nationals of other countries. The Society also recommends that the governments of member states, based on the needs of the situation, contact the governments of other non-member states to jointly eliminate this source of exchange rate instability. However, the Golden Society will also study the problems caused by domestic gold transactions that exceed the registered price. As a result, it was decided that unless these transactions are sufficient to affect the establishment of new exchange rates, damage the exchange rates of other member states, or seriously weaken the international financial position of a member state, resulting in affecting that country's use of the Fund, it is not intended to oppose it temporarily. The Fund has requested that its member states promptly take action to implement the recommendations listed in this announcement.</p>

Yesterday, Zhongcan Company had 40 packages open, with an E-grade, priced at 29.5 million yuan. Another burden's transaction price was the same as the previous day. The route for dried warp was sluggish, and the quoted price for single-item goods was 21 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's silk goods market started flat and ended up rising. Qiang quilt cover first sold for 10.95 million yuan, and later called 11.15 million yuan. The American quilt cover was not sold for 12 million yuan. The opening bid for Dacheng Checkered Crepe was 39,780 yuan. After many parties boosted the price, it slowly rose from 40,200 yuan to 500 yuan, and finally 800 yuan was the selling price. The next day the price was called 1,000 yuan. Huajin Crepe was still priced at the previous day in the morning. High-end goods were quoted at 2,000 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the rayon's skyrocketing, the price also rose to 24,000 yuan. No-light textiles and other products also saw a slight increase. The prices of Sheng goods and Hangzhou goods remained firm and unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market is Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market started strong, and the quoted prices for each brand were firm and rising. Resales in the market were also rare. People in the industry were only dragging in. There were even bids to buy in at the listed prices, pushing up the market sentiment. The market was then hyped up. By the end of the morning market, the price of ten Big British cigarettes had risen to 7.37 million yuan, an increase of 620,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Old Dao cigarettes also soared by 570,000 yuan to 6.37 million yuan. Wuhua rose by 180,000 yuan. The sales of Hademan cigarettes outside the port were not weak. They started at 5 million yuan and gradually rose to 5.35 million yuan, an increase of 350,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Market Trading Quiet; Rice Prices Shift from Firm to Weak; Raw Materials for Oil Extraction Scarce, Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the combined North and South markets received over 8,100 piculs of rice. Shops cleared their stock, but market trading was sluggish, and the market situation re-entered a downturn.  Jing rice fell by more than 10,000 yuan, while Zhongxia and lower grades of you rice fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Baiyuan rice also followed, dropping by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and Xian rice also decreased by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Although flour sales are normal, flour prices in producing areas are higher than in Shanghai, and wheat trends are firm.  The flour market appears weak but is actually firm, with strong support.  Hide prices turned weak, continuing to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cake trading was average, falling by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Yingkou cake fell by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, and soybeans followed the overall market decline, dropping by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. There was little high-quality red sorghum available, leading to a stalemate. Corn prices remained unchanged. Raw peanuts were actively purchased in South China, rising sharply and continuing to increase by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.  Sesame arrivals couldn't keep up with sales, and foreign firms continued to buy, causing prices to rise steadily, increasing by another 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Mung beans saw little activity in both arrivals and sales, with minimal price fluctuations. Red beans saw slight inquiries from Guangdong, gradually rising and increasing by another 10,000 yuan. Flour mills were keen on wheat, leading to firm prices in inland areas, rebounding by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Broad beans from Shantou and Taiwan were suspended, causing them to soften and fall sharply by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market showed mixed trends, with crude oil purchases from Guangdong leading to firmer prices. Soybean oil supply from factories continued steadily, maintaining average prices. Clear oil softened, rapeseed oil remained stable, and sesame oil held firm.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Edible oil prices rose again today. According to industry insiders, the recent halt of soybean exports from the Northeast has disrupted the source of raw materials for oil extraction, causing public panic and leading to panic buying.  Secondly, the sharp rise in black market foreign exchange and the resurgence of rice prices directly and indirectly contributed to the price increases.  Generally, oil merchants are still looking at the pre-war ratio of edible oil to rice prices. It is said that at that time, the market price of edible oil per dan could be equivalent to two dan of rice.</p>
<h3>Another Surge in Foreign Stocks; National Bonds Market Extremely Calm</h3>
<p>The public bond market was very stable yesterday, with limited fluctuations, and trading volume remained only around 2 million yuan. Unified Bonds opened at 7,500 yuan, rising from 7,450 yuan to close at 7,900 yuan. Foreign firms, rooms 552 and 503 were buyers, while rooms 360 and 555 were sellers. As a result, Classes A, B, and E each rose by 200 yuan compared to the previous close, while Classes C and D remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks were stimulated by the gold exchange and black market, causing another price surge. Ewo Yarns opened at 760,000 yuan, with securities firms and banks buying, while Guangdong firms and retail investors offered some. The Hong Kong-Shanghai telegram rate dropped to 10.04, reaching a high price of 860,000 yuan before slightly leveling off. As a result, compared to the previous close, Ewo Yarns and Jardine Matheson rose by 15%, British American Tobacco and China Merchants Steam Navigation rose by 10% each, and China Paper, Ewo Brewery, China Steel, Shanghai Telephone, and Shanghai Land Investment each rose by 5%, while industry associations saw smaller gains.</p>
<h3>Tight Sugar Supply Remains</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained tight, but Peruvian sugar was subject to speculative activity, leading to greater fluctuations. The association's initial price was 648,000 yuan, rising to 667,000 yuan, then softening to 655,000 yuan to 625,000 yuan. No. 20 Zhongsha Baizhan sugarcane initially added 145,000 yuan, then to 125,000 yuan and 130,000 yuan.  Combined Chi Hong was 470,000 to 465,000 yuan, semi-truck Baizhan was 560,000 to 570,000 yuan, and quarter-truck Baizhan was 580,000 to 590,000 yuan.  No. 24 coarse white sugarcane was added 175,000 to 165,000 yuan. Local sugar was also tight, with Shantou Qing at 360,000 to 375,000 yuan, with transactions not exceeding 100 bags. Diao Qing initially opened at 320,000 yuan, with another batch opening midway at 325,000 yuan, then to 332,000 yuan, later settling at 325,000 to 330,000 yuan, totaling 200 bags. Xinghua Bai was as high as 520,000 yuan, then 478,000 to 458,000 yuan, and Xinghua Chi was 425,000 yuan, with transactions of several dozen baskets.</p>
<h3>National Bank's Rediscount Committee Stipulates Dates for Foreign Exchange Advances in Various Regions; Also Approves Loans of 5 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Central Bank's Rediscount Committee held its 13th regular meeting at 4 PM on the 24th in the committee's meeting room. More than ten committee members attended, chaired by Qin Runqing. They approved 33 loan applications totaling 5.004 billion yuan. They also stipulated the dates for foreign exchange advances in various regions with Central Bank branches to serve as a standard for handling rediscounts.</p>
<p>Regarding the collateral for pledge loans, according to bank lending procedures, the collateral should originally be stored in a food warehouse. To facilitate manufacturers' use of raw materials under pledge and sales of finished products under pledge, the committee has relaxed the procedures for storing collateral for rediscount loans, changing it to finished products or raw materials, with the principle of storing half of the collateral in the industry warehouse and providing convenience for the exchange of collateral at any time. For loans not exceeding 100 million yuan, the collateral does not need to be stored in a warehouse and is managed by the lending bank.</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts on the Western Frontier from Xinjiang</h3>
<p>— Quick Report on the 22nd, Jiang Xin</p>
<p>Residing in the Northwest for three years cannot be considered a short time; but perhaps due to being accustomed to hearing, seeing, and living there, I have become somewhat unclear whether I am residing in a room filled with orchids or a market selling salted fish.  Initially, I couldn't help but feel surprised, but after a long time, yesterday was like this, today is like this, and tomorrow will probably be like this.  Since the facts are like this, what is there to be surprised about? Furthermore, seeing that everyone residing in this region seemed to be indifferent, if I alone felt strange and odd, wouldn't that be even stranger? Therefore, not long after I first arrived in the Northwest, I thought of writing about my experiences and feelings to report to the people of the country, but due to being busy and lazy, I didn't get around to writing. Later, I felt that since reality was already like this, what was there to say? Even if I spoke, it might not attract the attention of others.</p>
<p>Border Warning</p>
<p>It has only been three months since I left the Northwest in early March, which cannot be considered a long time, but I truly feel like "three autumns have passed." Everything in the Northwest seems strange to me. The Xinjiang warning has alarmed the whole country, and I cannot help but be alarmed as well, eagerly wanting to share my past experiences with the people of the country! However, because I was ordered to leave the country in a hurry, I was unable to bring all the materials I had collected in the past. Now, I can only talk casually based on my memory.</p>
<p>Anyone living in the Northwest is very familiar with the phrase "border disputes." What is unique is that in the past, everyone was limited to enthusiastic oral communication or could see a little in the local newspapers in the Northwest. This time is the "first" time it has been formally telegraphed by the Central News Agency and spread throughout the country. Important events, such as the so-called "Yining Incident" that disturbed the entire Northwest the year before last, only sparingly revealed their "pretty faces" twice when the "peace agreement" was about to be signed. The truly tense scenes of artillery fire and bloodshed were deleted by the red pens of diplomats. I remember that at that time, when we were touring Dunhuang, we made a detour to visit the oil mine in Yumen, Gansu. The oil mine had a branch mine in Wusu, Xinjiang. During the emergency, the Wusu branch mine sent an urgent telegram every hour, asking the head office to quickly send vehicles to pick up the employees for evacuation. At that time, only one battalion of the National Army and hundreds of miners were guarding the oil mine, while the enemy had two regiments with several cannons. Although the head office immediately dispatched more than a dozen Mack trucks to pick them up, it was estimated that the trucks would not reach Hami in time, and the Wusu mine would have already fallen. Later, an official in charge of the Wusu mine told me that when we evacuated, we automatically blocked and destroyed the mine shafts, lost all the machinery, and suffered many casualties among the employees. From the reflection of the oil mine bureau alone, one can infer the overall scale of the war at that time. However, from beginning to end, except for waiting for a peaceful resolution, there was not a single word of news in the newspapers. Furthermore, an officer who participated in the war personally told me that every time they fought, the ones charging in the front line were our own compatriots, while the officers supervising the battle and the artillery shooters were all genuine "X-country people." Especially when attacking large cities, it was all the same! However, at that time, even the words "certain country" could not be seen in the newspapers, as if those two words were only used in the "Northeast region" and could not be used in the "Northwest region." Now, they suddenly shout out that "there are planes with Soviet markings assisting in the battle, which is truly unprecedented."</p>
<p>Even more so, the great tragedy in January of this year. According to the provisions of the Yining Incident peace agreement, Han compatriots could originally return to live in the Yining, Tacheng, and other regions. However, on a certain day in January, when hundreds of Han compatriots returned to the Tacheng area on the Russian border, it happened to be dusk. Because they had no homes to return to, they had to sleep in the open. As a result, they heard a burst of intense gunfire at night. The next morning, they saw that most of the refugees, except for a few who pretended to be dead and then escaped, were lying there permanently. This incident was never reported in the newspapers either; only the suffering compatriots used mimeographed leaflets to distribute appeals everywhere, but the result was like a faint cry for help in the vast ocean, which would not receive any response!</p>
<p>We are truly surprised! These kinds of border disputes have indeed occurred "repeatedly" in the past, but why hasn't the government publicized them to the people of the country at any time, but has been suppressing them until now? Is it really trying to give the people of the country a "sudden" shock? The main reason is probably: in the past year, in order to safeguard friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, our government has been tolerant and silent about various facts of the Soviet Union violating the Sino-Soviet Treaty, such as preventing our country from taking over Lushun and Dalian, supporting the Northeast Communist Army and the Korean Communist Army in combat, and instigating Outer Mongolia to invade our border, causing the Beitashan Incident, etc. Judging from today's situation, it is no longer possible to sit idly by. It is reported that our government has decided to no longer adopt the appeasement policy of the past, but to adopt a tough diplomatic approach and accuse all the facts to the world!</p>
<p>Leaving the Country from Tacheng</p>
<p>An air force friend who has been stationed in Xinjiang for a long time told me the following facts:</p>
<p>"Just taking the Tacheng 'zone' as an example, the border line between China and the Soviet Union was originally very far north of Tacheng, but in less than a few years, the border markers have now run to the foot of the city of Tacheng. The city of Tacheng is on a small hill, and the foot of the hill north of the city has become Russian territory. The reason is that others can carry the border markers and run around at will, killing at will, and no one cares about us. If this phenomenon continues to develop, Tacheng will truly have to leave the country without a passport from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.…"</p>
<p>He also said: "We have no troops stationed on the border, let alone any defense measures. On the contrary, others are not like this. Along the border, there are bunkers everywhere, and troops are stationed to guard them. Furthermore, the trains in the country can go all the way to places not far from the border, which is extremely convenient for transportation! If any Chinese people walk within ten miles of the border, they are in danger of being shot, because the troops stationed in the neighboring country often like to use this opportunity for target practice.…"</p>
<p>Barbarian Cavalry Grazing Horses</p>
<p>I climbed the Mazongling on the border line, visited the ancient battlefield where Li Hua once sang sadly, and crossed Mazongling, which is not far from Outer Yehugu. According to the local people, groups of barbarian cavalry (in the past, they were compatriots, but now we can say this) often come to the south of the mountain to graze horses. If travelers are encountered by them, they will be robbed clean, and even their lives may not be spared!</p>
<p>In short, with such a border and such a national defense, it is no wonder that once a border warning is discovered, it is already 600 miles deep into the country.</p>
<p>For many years, Xinjiang has been a place of many troubles. Those who discuss the reasons for this believe that it is due to the excessive complexity of the ethnic groups. However, according to my actual observations in the Northwest for several years, I do not want to agree with this statement. I believe that ethnic complexity and the lack of unified language are only conditions that may constitute social disorder, but not its inevitable causes. Because in fact, there are countries with more complex ethnic groups and more diverse languages than Xinjiang, but they can still achieve stability. Just like the neighboring provinces of Ningxia, Qinghai, and Gansu, the ethnic groups are not simple and the languages are also different, but the disputes are not as many as in Xinjiang. We live in the Northwest and can say that we are in contact with compatriots with different clothes, customs, and habits at all times, but everyone can get along with each other equally, and no disputes often occur between the ethnic groups. On the contrary, even in the most simple Han ethnic group, a cruel civil war has been going on since the Republic of China, and now it is even more out of control. Therefore, ethnic complexity is only a condition that may cause chaos. Only when someone wants to use it and provoke it can it show the facts of chaos. The internal situation in Xinjiang is exactly like this. Unfortunately, in the past, a tragic history was created due to mistakes. Now, there are ambitious politicians internally and special forces externally who want to use it, which makes it impossible for Xinjiang to achieve stability. Most people who are familiar with the internal situation in Xinjiang know that the people of all ethnic groups hope to have a relatively stable life and do not want to make a career out of killing each other. Even those who have been trained by a certain party have now become aware that a certain party only wants to use them and does not really want to make them free and happy. However, until today, we can still cooperate with the majority of the people's desire for stability, win them over, and make it impossible for internal and external schemers to sell their schemes.</p>
<p>Agriculture and Minerals</p>
<p>We do not want to discuss the intentions of the internal schemers who deliberately want to create unrest in Xinjiang. However, we should study the intentions of the external forces. According to my observations, economic factors and political factors are very important. In the past, the disturbances created in Xinjiang would not directly help the Yan'an headquarters much. Now, it is not necessarily to cooperate with the military actions in the Northeast. Even if it now has the effect of killing two birds with one stone, it cannot be explained. The main thing is still in the economic aspect.</p>
<p>After the signing of the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship," we see today that the troops of Outer Mongolia have invaded. This is indeed an obvious plot, but at the time of the signing of the treaty, China also had a fleeting benefit, which was to make the situation in Xinjiang temporarily clear. The Soviet troops withdrew from Hami, Dihua, Wusu, and other places in Xinjiang, and the business institutions were also taken over by China. Especially the Wusu oil mine, according to a person in charge, the Soviet troops filled the mine shafts and moved the machines away before leaving. It was originally believed that China would not be able to repair it in three to five years, but we quickly made it able to produce oil again. The Wusu oil mine is not very large in scale, but the oil quality is higher than that of Yumen. According to experts, the Wusu mine and the Caucasus oil field are the same oil source. If China massively exploits it in Wusu (the original plan was to carry out large-scale mining and refining), it will directly affect the Caucasus. This is like two children eating the same mother's milk, which is inevitable to be jealous of each other. As a result of jealousy, the stronger brother naturally wants to push the younger brother away. Therefore, from an economic standpoint, it cannot be said that there is no part of the reason for explaining the last Yining Incident with the agricultural products of the Ili River Basin (the entire Xinjiang's demand for food relies on this region) and the oil mines of Wusu. At least because of this change, the main essence of Xinjiang has been completely lost. Furthermore, Xinjiang has a lot of coal reserves, and the quality is good. This has already been proven. In addition, in the past, it was also rumored that Xinjiang produces a lot of tungsten, which is a rare metal and indispensable for steelmaking. However, during the Anti-Japanese War, China sold it all to the United States, while the neighboring country could not get it, so it often felt dissatisfied. In the past year or so, after the atomic bomb was born, everyone has been rumored that Xinjiang has reserves of uranium raw materials, which are indispensable for making atomic bombs. The mine has been discovered by the neighboring country and is said to be near the Altai Mountains. I am not a mining expert, so I do not dare to say whether the rumors are true or not, but these vivid rumors are often heard. Regarding this, the neighboring country initially asked to mine it alone, but China did not allow it. Then it asked to jointly operate it, but was rejected again. Therefore, it is also difficult to make it satisfied. According to the above two unpleasant mentalities, we can see that there may be some clues to the relationship between this invasion of Outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>Raise Vigilance</p>
<p>With an Outer Mongolia with a population of only 900,000, if there is no external support, it will not be enough to realize the dream of using force to conquer people. However, even if a temporary compromise can be reached diplomatically, the problem is still not truly solved. Maybe there will be a second or third Beitashan Incident coming, making the border disputes that are already constantly spreading even more! To solve this problem, we must start from the inside. Because if the internal stability can be achieved, it is equivalent to blocking the doors and windows of external forces and cutting off the wings of internal schemers, so that they will never have the opportunity to display their magic.</p>
<p>The most important task for those in charge of Xinjiang now is how to compensate for the historical debts and take back the lost people's hearts. This work seems difficult, but it is not difficult in practice! Because the instability in the past allowed all kinds of monsters to take advantage of the opportunity. It is undeniable that Xinjiang has now become a paradise for schemers and adventurers. If this phenomenon is not cleared up as soon as possible, the future will be unimaginable. Stability, stability, only stability is a good medicine to save Xinjiang.</p>
<p>After the Beitashan Incident, many people advocated "raising vigilance" and "watching the changes." I think it is very right. Xinjiang is indeed a troublesome area in our country, and it is important. We should not ignore it. Unfortunately, it seems that it has not yet aroused the general attention of the people of the country. Xinjiang is our door, which is related to the safety of our entire national destiny. We must guard it firmly. But in the current attitude, we must not be too hasty. Problems that can be reasonably solved should be resolved through reason. Finally, I hope that the people of the country will not regard Xinjiang as a barren area in the Northwest. It is not only important in its location, but also has abundant agricultural products and rich mineral deposits. Especially the petroleum, according to the report after the expert survey, almost the entire Northwest has storage. All of this is closely related to our future nation-building. I remember when I was in Jiuquan, Gansu, I heard a song from a Kazakh girl, which gave me a very deep impression. Now I transcribe a paragraph below as the end of this article, in order to arouse the attention of the people of the country:</p>
<p>"The grapes of Turpan, the melons of Hami!</p>
<p>The furs of Yanqi and Kuqa are endless!…"</p>

<h3>The Isolated City of Anyang, Rescued from Battle</h3>
<p>— Air Report from Zhengzhou on the 20th, Our Reporter Fan Shiqin</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Station sees a lot of comings and goings every day, but these days, people from all walks of life are welcoming the wounded soldiers and young students evacuated from Anyang, which is the most sincere. Just from the fact that elementary school students are using some of their candy money to comfort those soldiers and young people, you will know that being unreasonably coerced by one kind of person must be compensated by double the comfort from another kind of person. Those wounded soldiers and young students, who have priority, are transported by plane to Xinxiang, and then transferred to Zhengzhou by car. The students are transported back and forth through a lottery system, which can be said to be very fair.</p>
<p>When Anyang was in danger and the planes had not yet dropped food, the livelihood of the 500,000 people inside and outside Anyang City was the most worrying thing for everyone. It is said that at that time, most of the refugees were filling their stomachs with grass roots and tree bark, and the students were eating the worst mixed grains and horse feed. All life was entrusted to brave battles, and brave battles were entrusted to full stomachs. Originally, precious food naturally became even more precious. Every time the National Army attacked, thousands of refugees followed behind them. When the National Army returned victorious, thousands of refugees followed behind them. When the refugees went, each of them carried an empty bag. When they returned, each of them carried a full bag. At first, the National Army persuaded the refugees to grab food, and later the refugees persuaded the National Army to attack. It is really unclear whether it was attacking to grab food or grabbing food to attack. At that time, the authorities in the city asked the people to store two months' worth of food. The wealthy families and businesses had to use most of their money to buy food. Where to buy food in this besieged isolated city? But in fact, there was a market for buying and selling food. The formation of this market was a</p>
<p>War Miracle. Every day, people who wanted to buy food in the city ran to a quiet open space outside the city. There, many people selling food were waiting for them. After they finished trading, the people who came out of the city to buy food returned to the city, and the people selling food disappeared. This happened every day. According to the statistics of the students who guarded the city gate, more than 2,000 dan of grain were brought into the city every day. This quiet open space outside the city seemed to have magic power, and it had never been hit by a single bullet. The people who came and went to sell food in this market every day were quite like the incarnation of the gods in magical novels, who came to save those suffering people. In fact, they were also like those suffering people. They were a kind of villagers from the four villages who had surplus grain and stole away through the</p>
<p>fire line to exchange for the surplus salt of the people in the city. The people were saving themselves in this situation, which is really great. But in the meantime, we cannot deny that there is some divine power helping them. It is said that this year's harvest in the four villages of Anyang is the most prosperous that has never been seen in the past.</p>
<p>According to them, during the siege of Anyang, except for the curfew from 8:00 pm or short-term curfews at any time during the day, everything was the same as usual. Rickshaw drivers were still pulling cars, and there was still meat and fish in the restaurants. The prices of general things, of course, fell, and of course, food was particularly expensive, once costing 30,000 yuan per catty.</p>
<p>Li Zhenqing, the division commander of the 40th Division who guarded Dongyang City, was seen by the common people and soldiers every day. The only difference was in the time difference, that is, he appeared in front of the common people when there was no battle, and he appeared in front of the soldiers when there was a battle. His troops had</p>
<p>iron discipline. A soldier was shot and killed by him for robbing someone of more than 30,000 yuan. This is how one thing happened. The students helped him prevent bad people from mixing into the city. At night, the students climbed on the roofs to guard. After discovering that someone hung a signal gun on a tree and pulled it with a rope at the bottom of the tree, the city became even quieter.</p>
<p>A section of the railway outside the city was always controlled by the National Army. Two armored vehicles patrolled back and forth. The common people said that these were two lions guarding the gate.</p>
<p>It is said that Liu Bocheng still wanted to attack Dongyang, but this time I have not heard that he prepared to take Dongyang in three weeks. Perhaps he was prepared to lose all his "capital" in Dongyang!</p>

<h3>On Guangdong Series</h3>
<p>— Lu Danlin</p>
<p>Published by the Guangdong Series Editorial and Printing Committee, Printed by The Commercial Press</p>
<p>The Guangdong Series is one of the greatest classics published in our country after the Anti-Japanese War. It is the first collection compiled and printed by the Guangdong Series Editorial and Printing Committee. This committee was established in Hong Kong in the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), with funding mostly provided by the government of Guangdong Province. It was a semi-public, semi-private organization. The standing committee members were Ye Gongchuo (also serving as the chairman), Jian Youwen, and Lu Danlin. The committee also included thirteen members such as Xu Dishan, Xu Xinfu, Huang Huabiao, Huang Yinpu, and Chen Lesu, as well as fifty-three advisors including Xu Chongqing, Li Hanhun, Jiang Fucong, Chen Yuan, Wang Yunwu, Zhang Yuanji, Li Yinglin, and Yuan Tongli. The guidelines for compilation and printing were based on Guangdong-related literature, with a focus on collecting works by Guangdong natives. (Works by living authors were not included, except for edited versions of old works.) The selected editions were all rare and hard to find, and when less ideal editions were chosen, there were specific reasons for doing so. For example, the Qujiang Collection was used this time because it was the detailed annotation copy of Wen Rushi.</p>
<p>The list of books for the first collection was finalized in the winter of the 29th year (1940). After detailed proofreading, publication was discussed with The Commercial Press. It was originally scheduled to be fully published in the winter of the 30th year (1941). Unexpectedly, after a portion of the books had been printed, the Japanese invaders launched the Pacific War. Consequently, some of the printed books that had been transported to Hong Kong were lost. The manuscripts that were in Shanghai and being worked on could not be continued due to labor and material shortages. After the victory, the two parties negotiated several times, selected workers, and added materials. It took about a year to completely publish the entire series. In total, it took seven years from the initial submission of manuscripts to the final completion. During the Anti-Japanese War, countless public and private cultural relics were lost. The fact that this series was finally published unscathed after so many twists and turns can only be described as a joyous event for the publishing industry.</p>
<p>The first collection of the Guangdong Series consists of seven books, bound in twenty-eight volumes. The entire series is exquisitely printed on high-quality Lian Shi paper, bound in thread. About seventy to eighty percent of the books are reproduced from the original editions, while twenty to thirty percent are typeset. Each book, except for those with previous annotations, has been carefully proofread. If there were any doubts, various editions were collated to ensure perfection before printing. A brief description of the content of each book is provided below:</p>
<p>(1) The Collected Works of Zhang Qujiang, written by Zhang Jiuling of the Tang Dynasty. This twelve-volume, eight-book edition with annotations by Wen Rushi is stored in the Nanzhou Shulou Library of the Xu family in Panyu. It includes Wen Rushi's original carved edition of the textual research of Qujiang Collection in two volumes, and a chronicle in one volume, stored in the Nanzhou Shulou Library of the Xu family. Zhang Qujiang is the oldest literary figure in Lingnan. There are eight known carved editions of the Qujiang Collection. The one used here is Wen Rushi's annotated edition, which is the result of over twenty years of in-depth research and can be said to be the most valuable Zhang Qujiang edition in the country.</p>
<p>(2) The Beauty of Wuxi, written by Yu Jing of the Song Dynasty. This twenty-volume, six-book edition is a Ming Chenghua carved edition stored in the Tieqin Tongjian Lou Library of the Qu family in Changshu. It includes Yu Xiangong's memorial to the throne in two volumes, and Huang Foyi's compilation of missing works from the Wuxi Collection in one volume. Yu Jing and Zhang Qujiang were both outstanding figures from Shaozhou during the Tang and Song dynasties. Yu Jing's talent lay in adaptability, and his writing style reflected this, defying categorization. Qiu Jun's preface to the Chenghua edition places him alongside Zhang Qujiang, and there is a reason for this.</p>
<p>(3) The Collection of Beiyan Cliff, written by Huang Gongfu of the Ming Dynasty. This four-volume, two-book edition is the original carved edition stored in the Qiubo Qin Guan Library of the Li family in Zhongshan and the Yijiangnan Guan Library of the Huang family in Panyu. During the Wei Zhongxian era, Huang Gongfu impeached Wei Zhongxian, earning him a reputation for righteousness throughout the country. He loved his ruler and was loyal to his country. He self-immolated at the age of eighty-four, leaving behind a legacy that will last for millennia. His poetry and prose have their own unique style.</p>
<p>(4) Drafts Preserved in the Ministry of Rites, written by Chen Zizhuang of the Ming Dynasty. This eight-volume, three-book edition is the original carved edition stored in the Nanzhou Shulou Library of the Xu family. Chen Zizhuang sacrificed himself for his country with unwavering loyalty, and his opposition to foreign invasion makes him a beacon of national glory. This book mainly contains routine drafts, such as caring for the crown prince and assisting the royal family. His commitment to the major principles of the court can be seen between the lines. The proposals he put forward are all essential and feasible, demonstrating his ambitions. Chen Zizhuang's posthumous collections, such as the Nangong Yuncong Collections, are no longer available, and the Lianyaotang Collection is also incomplete. Only this collection is complete, making it even more precious.</p>
<p>(5) Literary Manuscripts of the Lotus Beard Pavilion, written by Li Suiqiu of the Ming Dynasty. This eighteen-volume, three-book edition is an old manuscript stored in the Nanzhou Shulou Library of the Xu family. It is a collection of poetry and prose by Li Meishu, a talented Lingnan scholar and Zhuangyuan (top scholar) known as the Peony Zhuangyuan. This book has never been published and is a treasured hand-copied manuscript. Pan Lai commented on his collection: "Reading his writing is like looking at exquisite workmanship with an ingenious mind, carving the moon and tailoring the clouds... He was willing to sacrifice his life for his country and achieve benevolence through righteousness! He fearlessly pointed at traitors and angrily gnawed at the tyrants of Suiyang..." This gives a general idea of its value.</p>
<p>(6) The Yuyuan Collection, written by Liang Chaozhong of the Ming Dynasty. This four-volume, three-book edition is the original carved edition stored in the Nanzhou Shulou Library of the Xu family. Liang Chaozhong sacrificed himself in resisting the Qing army, showing unwavering integrity and deserving praise. His writing is highly regarded by the world. The Yuyuan Collection was destroyed by the Qing government during the Qianlong era, making this a unique copy in the country. The righteousness of Yushan remains forever, and the national spirit has an indelible existence.</p>
<p>(7) Literary Manuscripts of Wengshan, written by Qu Dajun of the Ming Dynasty. This four-volume, three-book edition is an early Qing carved edition stored in the Yijiangnan Guan Library of the Huang family, with Xu Xinfu's compilation of Wengshan's literary selections in three volumes. Qu Dajun's lifelong immortal work, though belonging to the Record of Righteousness under the Four Dynasties, is being organized and proofread. The four volumes of literary manuscripts are divided into prefaces, records, inscriptions, epitaphs, biographies, etc. Wang Shizhen praised Qu Dajun's poems as Li Bai himself said: "Coughs and saliva fall from the nine heavens, generating pearls and jade with the wind." His prose is learned and eloquent, possessing an unstoppable force. This collection is the most abundant.</p>
<p>Due to the war, a portion of the entire series was lost. Only two hundred copies could be fully assembled. Each book is composed of unique copies, first editions, meticulously proofread editions, and secret manuscripts. It is not only a great classic in the publishing industry after the war, but it also has a special position and contribution in Chinese literature. It is not only related to the local culture of Lingnan, but also promotes the national spirit. Most of these books have been shipped to Guangdong for sale. Soon, they will also be publicly sold in Shanghai. The list of books for the second collection is currently being selected and discussed, and it will be decided and sent to print soon.</p>
<h3>Principles and Applications of Radio</h3>
<p>— Nianhong</p>
<p>Written by H.Q. Sun, translated by Ding Xi, published by Kaiming Bookstore, 12,000 yuan</p>
<p>Translations of radio books often err on the side of being too specialized and obscure, failing to meet the needs of ordinary amateur enthusiasts. Moreover, those proficient in radio are not necessarily proficient in foreign languages, especially the latter. Generally, radio scholars tend to have less comprehensive cultivation. Introducing and translating renowned foreign scientific works into the local language is no easy task. Therefore, many translations, while based on masterpieces that were popular abroad, read awkwardly and are difficult to digest in Chinese. Furthermore, the lack of unified terminology and the vast differences between domestic and foreign situations mean that many things considered ordinary in countries with advanced radio industries become difficult to even find parts for when brought to China. This situation is extremely common. Besides, translating a book requires considerable effort, which is even more difficult in the current environment. Due to these various factors, it is difficult to find a suitable book on the market.</p>
<p>In addition to its appropriate and substantial content, this book is particularly valuable for its fluent translation, making it almost indistinguishable from an original work. From beginning to end, it flows seamlessly, demonstrating considerable effort. The translator has added personal opinions and annotations regarding aspects that are incompatible with China's national conditions, supplemented the shortcomings of the original work by referencing the state of China's radio market, and included photographs and features of many excellent domestic products, preventing readers from feeling lost and disconnected from the outside world.</p>
<p>The book consists of twelve chapters. The first chapter briefly describes several of the most basic electrical principles, making the book accessible to friends with a special interest in radio who have not received higher education and can use it as a beginner's reader to enter the circle. The last section briefly describes relatively new radio knowledge (not in a deep and didactic theoretical style). Using simple language and based on the level of knowledge readers have after completing the book, it explains "television," "telephonic sound movies," and "telephotography," enabling readers to understand the basic concepts of these new things, thereby stimulating their curiosity about radio and dispelling the negative perception that radio is a difficult and unattainable science. The book balances theory and practice, though it seems to lean slightly towards the former. In the later chapters, when discussing applications, it often interweaves deeper principles, which is a strength of the book. It progresses from simple to profound, rather than being a flat exposition, preventing readers from simply copying experiments by following circuit diagrams and parts lists, and instead enabling them to design and apply things themselves, creatively inspiring their intelligence. The chapter on vacuum tubes also includes the characteristics, curve diagrams, and base diagrams of various commonly used vacuum tubes of each model, providing readers with a reference during installation and facilitating their work considerably. The chapter on new-style multi-tube radios provides detailed explanations of the detection stage, low-frequency amplification stage, high-frequency amplification stage, and output stage, and teaches readers how to connect, match, and design these stages. This is far superior to ordinary editions that simply collect a few circuit diagrams.</p>
<p>Radio is a rapidly evolving field. This book is based on the original author's revised and reprinted edition from 1933, which is already fourteen years old. During this period, radio technology has advanced rapidly, to say the least. Due to the book's popularity, the original author must have naturally added new material to each edition to keep up with the times. However, although the Chinese translation of this book has already sold around ten editions, its content and writing style remain unchanged. The translator and publisher should pay attention to this. Although China's radio industry is lagging behind and the latest foreign innovations may not be entirely suitable for our needs, we must strive to improve as much as possible to avoid falling too far behind!</p>
<h3>People's Weekly (Edited by Gu Jiegang)</h3>
<p>— Meng Kun</p>
<p>In the currently sluggish publishing industry, the emphasis is disproportionately on magazines. However, regardless of the periodical, they are all aimed at intellectuals or small-town residents. Even the latter often only provide entertainment. The "People's Weekly" is aimed at readers among the lower and middle classes with limited literacy. We feel this is very necessary and should be recommended and encouraged.</p>
<p>Four issues of "People's Weekly" have been published to date. These four issues clearly demonstrate its overall style and direction. It introduces very simple current events, very popular common knowledge, and includes many learning-oriented articles, with a particular emphasis on reading and writing skills. Every article is so simple in form, even adopting ballad formats where possible. The content is also easy to understand and accept. Most importantly, every article is related to the lives of the masses.</p>
<p>At a time when popular education is stagnant and there is a lack of popular reading materials, the publication of such a magazine deserves attention. We should appreciate Mr. Gu Jiegang's efforts and the publisher's good intentions.</p>
<p>However, in our criticism, we should also offer some hopes, hoping that it can get even closer to the masses and become a truly universal primer. The authors should ideally have a preliminary plan, defining a certain number of essential vocabulary words as a long-term standard for national literacy. There should be more pictures to introduce the surrounding environment, or to use picture-based literacy methods to enable common people with little time to learn more words and expand their reading abilities. If printing technology permits, the National Phonetic Alphabet should be added next to each character.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the publishing industry should follow suit and produce similar publications.</p>
<h3>World Political Reference Map</h3>
<p>— Xin Jun</p>
<p>Edited by Jin Zhonghua, illustrated by Zhu Yu, printed and distributed by World Knowledge Society</p>
<p>For anyone who studies or enjoys international current affairs, having an accurate political reference map is essential, because it can strengthen our deeper understanding of international current events.</p>
<p>The international situation after World War II is obviously very different from before. After several years of brutal warfare, the world has changed. It has resulted in the confrontation between the two major camps of capitalism and socialism, and at the same time, the contradictions within capitalism have intensified. Under this new world situation, old maps always feel somewhat disconnected.</p>
<p>In the publishing industry, there are many books on international politics, but few reference maps on international politics. Currently, it can be said that there are almost none. Now, the World Knowledge Society has published this "World Political Reference Map," which can be said to be good news for anyone who pays attention to international issues.</p>
<p>This is a relatively complete and systematic international political map, compiled and produced from the collection of post-World War II international political activities. It is detailed and accurate.</p>
<p>It includes a total of sixty-one maps, divided into six parts:</p>
<p>The first part: is the post-war world situation, with eight maps: (1) Post-War World Situation Map, (2) The Full Picture of the United Nations, (3) United Nations Trusteeship Territories Map, (4) History of Atomic Bomb Development Map, (5) The Situation Around the Arctic Under the Confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, (6) The Situation of the Antarctic Continent Under the Competition of Various Countries, (7) The Route Map of the Byrd Expedition to Antarctica, (8) World Oil Zone Distribution Map.</p>
<p>These maps show the post-war world situation in detail, and each map is accompanied by a brief explanation. This proves that every map has one.</p>
<p>The second part is the part on the five major powers. It draws out the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, China, and France in the post-war world, with a total of twelve maps explaining each sector of the five major powers in full detail.</p>
<p>The third part is the European part, which includes more countries: Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Spain, and so on. It divides into twenty-two explanations and maps to draw out the characteristics and prospects of these countries.</p>
<p>The fourth part is the Middle East part, which uses nine maps to show the various aspects of this region, such as international struggle, oil problems, and other items.</p>
<p>The fifth part is the Far East part, which includes Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, and parts of India.</p>
<p>The sixth part is the Americas part, which is relatively simple, including Argentina, Alaska, and Canada.</p>
<p>Looking at these contents, their richness and brilliance are obvious at a glance.</p>
<p>Finally, I must think of the editor and illustrator of this map. The editor, Mr. Jin Zhonghua, works for the United States Information Service. Everyone knows about his international research. The explanations in these maps were all written by Mr. Jin.</p>
<p>The illustrator, Mr. Zhu Yu, is a young illustrator, and his achievements can be summed up in facts.</p>
<p>The only shortcomings of this map are the lack of zoning colors and the poor quality of the paper, which are probably limited by publishing conditions, and there is no way to avoid it.</p>
<h3>"Street Literary Talk"</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>Written by Xu Maoyong, printed by Guangming Bookstore</p>
<p>The book "Street Literary Talk" contains twenty-eight short essays. According to their content, they can be roughly divided into three parts: creative preparation, popular literature, and miscellaneous thoughts.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the book, the author advises every literary worker to pay attention to their own preparation before writing: First, they must train their ability to observe and constantly educate themselves in the face of reality, cultivating a correct outlook on life and the world. When observing, their minds must be calm. The main condition for Gorky's success was "seeing a lot." He noted before his short story "Autumn Night": "This is a record of someone who has seen a lot." Second, the reason why works of art are moving is because they contain powerful emotions. Therefore, a literary worker must have the ability to sense everything. Emotion is not "sentimentality." Sentimentality is just a kind of weak emotion that is harmful to life, and it has no value. Writing must start from society in order to actively promote the development of life. Writers must cultivate powerful emotions, and they must experience pure and great emotions from the work of the masses. Third, in terms of descriptive ability, one must grasp the most characteristic image of things, arrange them, and then express them correctly. This is the basic condition for description. Observation, feeling, and description cannot transcend reality. Oscar Wilde's aestheticism, because it was divorced from life, was eventually destroyed in the fire of reality. He replaced "art for art" with "art for life," simply because he later saw a deeper and more real life in prison. He praised Dostoevsky's works as great because they contained the element of "sympathy." Literary writers are not only writing for a few people. The scope of their consciousness should transcend their own class and feel the thoughts and emotions of other classes. Only in this way can they gain a wide readership, and their works can be highly evaluated. For whom are today's writers writing? Jean-Richard Bloch said: "I only see two desirable attitudes: 'Either leave the world and devote oneself entirely to the inner struggle, regarding the conflict of the self as the most intense and arduous, but resolute struggle; or welcome a society around him, a society that is transforming, re-planning, fighting heroically, full of vigor, burning with passion, and moving forward beyond itself. It needs poets who are in step with it and who鼓鼓 its rhythm forward.'"</p>
<p>Those engaged in popular literature must seek themes from the lives of the masses, approach them, and understand their living conditions and level of knowledge. Then, they must write in "understandable words." "Clarity, simplicity, and conciseness" are the essence that Tolstoy extracted from popular language. Gorky's works are welcomed by the masses of all countries because his style is clear and simple, and his content expresses the suffering and joy, creation and struggle of the oppressed. "Art for life" must have compassion. Popular literature is not simply about depicting workers or farmers, pitying them from the perspective of an outsider. Nor is it simply about speaking in the tone of the masses, recounting the harshness of living conditions, complaining endlessly, and hanging one's head in despair, as if that is enough to be a popular literary scholar. If he cannot express a positive attitude towards reality, does not have the steel-like strength of labor and will for life, lacks enthusiasm for building a new life, and lacks the power to destroy the bad heritage of old traditions, he is still a failure. Popular literature hopes to truly change the world.</p>
<p>The book ends with a few short essays on "Literary Miscellany," talking about aesthetics, humor, scientific essays, rural literature, etc. Although there is a lack of unity in the arrangement, they are still works that have been put together with much effort. In particular, when the author frankly stated that he had given up the idea of becoming a writer, it was full of sincerity and a sense of desolation. He said: "My failure was originally due to the emptiness of life. People whose own lives are empty will not deeply recognize the fulfilled lives of others, and of course it will be even more difficult to express them deeply... After this realization, I became even more alienated from literature." These words, when seen by aspiring literary beginners, cannot help but feel a little "heroic spirit shortened." But isn't it also a powerful warning, encouraging us how urgently we need to enrich our own lives!</p>
<p>The book's writing style is simple and clear. When explaining the essentials, it often cites famous works by various writers for explanation, so it is quite easy to read. It is a pity that a bibliography is not attached behind each book, and at the same time, when quoting the words of others in several places, it is not explained in detail, which may not be very appropriate.</p>
<h3>Random Talks on Independence</h3>
<p>— Wang Cong</p>
<p>I happened to see a sentence in a small book, meaning: "Thoughts are like nuns, they must cover their faces when they go out."</p>
<p>From this, I thought of the Buddhist explanation of the human mind as a mirror, with all worldly fame and wealth accumulating on the mind's mirror like ashes. Over time, this precious mirror loses its ability to illuminate.</p>
<p>In today's decline, the狂desires of matter have the appearance of sweeping across the souls of the world. Many bright heart mirrors are buried in the mud of matter and flesh.</p>
<p>True value is being denied. (I will never believe that truth will die, this is just a dark cloud temporarily obscuring the sun.)</p>
<p>Why should thoughts dress up as a nun, and cover their faces?</p>
<p>Someone said:</p>
<p>"Love is like a warm cough, you can't hold it in forever; let it double in your throat." Naturally, this is a clever metaphor. Because even the smartest person cannot hide his love.</p>
<p>I have the same view on thoughts.</p>
<p>Because they are often born of existing social oppression. Even if we cover them with a veil, we cannot stop them from going out.</p>
<p>A philosopher said:</p>
<p>"The books that record my thoughts are like a mirror. If a donkey looks at it, it will never see an unparalleled beauty."</p>
<p>Although this is an overly pretentious statement, it is not without truth.</p>
<p>There is a saying in ancient Chinese books that there are different views on wisdom and benevolence.</p>
<p>Differences in perspective often make people doubt the truth. Sages often suffer from hardship, perhaps for this reason.</p>

<h3>Purging Japanese Cultural War Criminals</h3>
<p>— Bao Qing</p>
<p>Under the urging of the Allied occupation authorities, the Japanese government's purge efforts began at the start of the year, targeting problematic figures in the news industry (such as newspaper editors-in-chief, managers, leading writers, and news editors). Those who played a prominent role in propaganda have also been banned from holding official positions, with restrictions extended to their immediate family members.</p>
<p>Like other Allied control measures in Japan, the purge is proceeding slowly. The Japanese Central Purge Committee has only recently finalized specific plans for purging war criminals in the media, which will be announced soon. The targets of the purge include organizations involved in newspapers, news agencies, film and theater, and broadcasting associations, for producing and supporting war rhetoric between July 7th and the surrender.</p>
<p>In the past, Japan's efforts to purge these problematic figures were not thorough, allowing many war criminals to escape punishment. Some members of the Purge Committee themselves are suspected of being problematic figures, using the excuse that the Allied headquarters had not specified a deadline for the purge and that the wartime activities of various problematic figures could not be investigated clearly in a short time, repeatedly delaying the process and using the purge to attack their political enemies.</p>
<p>Now that the purge of war criminals in the media has begun, those mouthpieces who spread militarist ideas must, of course, be purged. As for those lackeys who waved the flag and cheered in the literary world, such as Kan Kikuchi, Ki Kimura, and Bumbō Niwa, who flattered the military during the war and now sing the praises of democracy, they should be exposed and identified by progressive cultural circles so that readers can recognize the truth. As part of the purge of cultural war criminals, an investigation into the wartime military propaganda activities of journalists is about to begin, and the possibility of current Foreign Minister Hitoshi Ashida being purged has already been widely rumored outside of the Three Islands.</p>
<p>Hitoshi Ashida is the leader of the Democratic Party of Japan. The formation of the Katayama three-party coalition cabinet relied entirely on the coordination of the Democratic Party, and Ashida's assistance was significant. Therefore, his political enemies want to use the purge to settle scores with him and attempt to disintegrate the Katayama cabinet. In particular, Ashida recently made statements demanding the recovery of the Kuril Islands and Okinawa, making his purge even more likely. From 1933 to 1940, he served as president and leading writer of the English-language *Japan Times* as an international affairs expert, expounding his high theories during the period of aggression against our country, even earning the title of "critic who kills with a single phrase." Now, holding the high position of Foreign Minister, he speaks out demanding the recovery of Okinawa and other places, hoping the Allies will reduce reparations, and even hoping for a loan from the United States.</p>
<p>As we hope that Japan will move towards democratization today, we must also hope that when Japan purges cultural war criminals, it will conduct a fair investigation, not only targeting individuals and local institutions, but also conducting a thorough investigation of the entire cultural system and purging it, in order to truly achieve the work of cultural rectification.</p>
<h3>Sable and Lynx Fur</h3>
<p>— Ji Ming</p>
<p>Our country claims to be a "land of etiquette," so the dress codes of past dynasties were strictly regulated, with the color and quality of clothing corresponding to official rank. Except for musicians and performers, no one was allowed to overstep the bounds. The Qing Dynasty, with its Manchu rulers, had even more unique regulations. Emperor Shengzu decreed that officials of the second rank and above in the Censorate could wear sable and lynx fur to court in winter, while those below the second rank could choose fox or sheepskin. After the Yongzheng and Qianlong eras, the ancestral system gradually fell into disuse, and even members of the Hanlin Academy and censors began to presumptuously wear sable and lynx fur. At that time, Ren Kuizun, known for his uprightness, served as Deputy Censor-in-Chief and petitioned for the restoration of the old system. The Emperor agreed. Beijing was cold, and the officials who had initially made sable fur waited outside the hall, shivering. Therefore, they cursed Ren Kuizun. A busybody wrote a poem: "Hanlin Academy and the Censorate, stripped of sable and lynx fur. Last night, the fifth watch was bone-chilling, who in the court does not resent Ren Kuizun?" In my opinion, the strict regulations on clothing should not be adopted today, but the complete absence of a system is also prone to chaos. When we watch Beijing opera, we know the identity of each character from their clothes. Nowadays, in the streets and alleys, all kinds of strange clothes appear. Poor university professors dress like grooms, while entertainers and servants dress like high officials. Is this not going too far? (Anecdotes from the Qing Dynasty, Part 3)</p>
<h3>China New Journalism College Social Gathering</h3>
<p>— Bai Shui</p>
<p>Under the pouring rain, the China New Journalism College held a social gathering, the first of its kind since its establishment, finally taking place at Yiyuan at 2 PM on the 21st. Participants, including students, alumni, reporters, and guests, numbered no fewer than 300. Despite the adverse effects of the uncooperative weather, participants still gathered in large numbers, truly creating a new record for social gatherings in Shanghai's news industry.</p>
<p>In front of Yiyuan, traffic was heavy and the scene was unprecedented. Guests braved the rain to attend, which was truly unexpected. No wonder the chairman of the gathering, Bu Youfu, and the college president, Chen Gaoyong, were always smiling, greeting every guest. In fact, President Chen was also one of the guests (because the gathering was organized by the students), but he still displayed the straightforward style typical of northerners, helping the chairman to receive guests, thus making everyone feel an unexpected warmth and encouragement, adding another lively atmosphere to the venue.</p>
<p>The venue was already crowded enough, and the gazes of more than 600 eyes were unanimously focused on the microphone at the front. After the chairman of the gathering, Bu Youfu, delivered a brief opening speech, President Chen, guest Shu Mou, and others delivered speeches in succession.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, various recreational activities began. Finally, all the guests and students danced together to the accompaniment of music.</p>
<p>When they dispersed, the torrential rain outside had not yet stopped!</p>
<h3>Setting the Wind</h3>
<p>— Hu Yu</p>
<p>Attacking newspaper offices, cases occur one after another</p>
<p>Why keep attacking? Isn't it enough? Could this be an evil trend of the times? How can newspapers carry news when they are repeatedly attacked? Strange! It seems like a deep hatred that leads to this destruction?</p>
<p>Freedom of speech, alas, a dream! Shut your mouth! You should know what's what and look at the fists! It would be better for everyone to change professions, be coerced, and wear red balls on their heads every day!</p>
<h3>"Peach and Plum Compete in Fragrance": Joan Harrison and Peter Lawford</h3>
<h3>A Scalding Hot Potato</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ge Chunliang</p>
<p>I have a friend who told me that he had learned a very, very valuable lesson from his mother. One day, his mother took him to the kitchen and put a potato in a pot of boiling water. After boiling it for a while, she took it out with tongs and said to me, "Hey, son, hold on tight!"—and threw the scalding potato to him.</p>
<p>He held it in his hands, agonizing, but his mother was laughing and saying, "You don't know what to do, do you!"</p>
<p>"Suddenly, I knew," my friend said, writing: "I threw the scalding potato back to my mother. She seemed a little surprised, but she caught it and threw it back into the pot of water. Then she said, 'This can make you never forget this lesson in your life. Whenever anyone throws a scalding potato at you—what should you do? Throw it back at them!'"</p>
<p>My friend said that at first, for many years, he didn't understand why. Although his mother explained that a "scalding potato" is a difficult situation to deal with, or a difficult question to answer—often given to you without warning. She said that in your life, you will meet many clever people who will pretend to be deaf and dumb and throw the problem back at you, without answering it themselves; you will meet even more clever people who will throw the problem at you and then sit comfortably, studying what you know, observing how you handle the difficult problem—in other words, after you grab that scalding potato, what should you do? Perhaps the scalding potato has been "stroked" in your hands for a long time, and even if you throw it back at him, it is no longer hot—in this way, you have suffered from his potato. Or, because of your struggling situation, he also understands how to handle the potato without getting burned.</p>
<p>Although this is a very ordinary little matter, it can be etched in your mind and is very thought-provoking. Speaking of this story, it reminds me of what my father often said to me: "Child. If you remember this sentence, you will definitely be able to cope with the world with ease. When you express your opinions, you are merely repeating what you already know—but if you listen quietly to what others say, you may learn something."</p>
<p>I often pay attention to a very successful young man, a thin and quiet figure. Since leaving the military, he can now get millions of US dollars from several large companies and factories. In board meetings, when he encounters problems, he always cleverly passes them on to others, often adding a pleasing remark: "You know more about this than I do—what are your opinions?" Then, as the meeting is about to end, that friend collects all the most brilliant proposals, eliminates the trivial and unsuitable, extracts the essence, transforms it into his own components, and thus transforms the "scalding potatoes" thrown from all over the meeting room into a delicious dish.</p>
<p>He told me that he learned this method in the military from a junior officer, who always listened quietly and nodded gracefully in meetings. When problems came to him, he always humbly introduced them to his superiors, who were always very happy to hear his sincere remarks. Then, as the meeting was about to end, when everyone was asked if there were any other suggestions, this silent man would stand up and try to express a speech that contained all the most brilliant ideas.</p>
<p>"I learned the importance of timing," my friend said: "How to observe, how to wait, how to study, how to think—once you get the opportunity, throw that 'scalding potato' out." (Self-translated from the June Reader's Digest)</p>
<h3>Sundries from America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>The Spirit of Price Controls is Not Dead</p>
<p>The American Office of Price Administration (OPA) died with the victory of the war, and ceiling prices have become a thing of the past. But during the war, the people benefited greatly from it, and unscrupulous merchants and hoarders had no way to do anything. Prices were frozen, taking the day before the Pearl Harbor incident as the baseline. Complementary to price controls were rationing and punishment for raising prices, with national prices being completely uniform. For example, a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes sold for 15 cents in New York and also sold for 15 cents in Los Angeles. Food price limits were the strictest, with the limit price per pound clearly marked on each type of canned food or vegetable and meat. Shopping required a Ration Book. A ration book was issued every year, with various colored stamps. The stamp for buying eggs had a picture of an egg. Red ones counted for a certain number of points, and blue ones counted for a certain number of points. Vegetables and fish did not require stamps. Among fruits, grape juice required the most points, about 36 or 37 points. At first, I did not apply for a ration book because I ate in the officers' mess and did not need a ration book at all. However, in order to make braised pork, I could not buy pork without a ration book, so I also registered with the Ration Board, and a ration book was sent by mail. So, I cooked Chinese food in the cafeteria every day and indulged myself. The Office of Price Administration encouraged people to report unscrupulous merchants who raised prices, punishing them thousands of times the amount of the overcharge, with half of the fine being used as a bonus and the rest going to the government. Rent valuation was less standardized and had to be reported to the Office of Price Administration to set the rent, with a monthly rent of about 30 yuan per room. The Office of Price Administration was able to successfully implement its policies with the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Federal Bureau of Investigation was known for exposing unscrupulous merchants and capturing "tigers," and even the cunning Jews did not dare to test the law. The official residence of a certain provincial governor was found to have hundreds of cans, and he was punished for hoarding and profiteering. (3)</p>
