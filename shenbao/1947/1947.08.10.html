<p>伙人有權要求就伙國需要，拆運日本工廠，作爲賠償。日本旣有過剩之紡機品輸出，我人如何拆運其紡織設備，日本旣需中國供應海鹽，我人如何拆運其製碱工廠？以碱業而論，中國戰前年諾十二萬噸，當時永利日產二百噸，茲因設備遭日人八年慘酷使用，每日產量已减至八十噸，而設備且隨時有發生危險可能，永利一垮，全國化學工業勢將均陷絕境，處此情形，拆運日本設備實爲最上之策」。中紡津副理王瑞基謂，日本對我國輸出計劃，紡織品佔總額百分之七十五，此一數額將直接操縱我國民經濟之榮枯。銀錢業公會理事長陳亦候稱，戰前日紗來華傾銷，曾一度使我國棉價高於紗價。此過去情形，至足發人深省。討論結果，決分電中央，對日本危及我國工業之出品，禁止輸入，並要求拆運日本工廠設備。對赴日商務考察團。津市應有相當名額，</p>
<p>日本可輸出貨品　共達二百零七種</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓八日電〕美商務部宣布，該部已接獲列舉日本可供出口之二百零七種貨物之首次報吿。試部稱，淸車上各項貨物共分爲三十七類，且附有各貨在目前貯藏量之估計，以及若干貨物在本月及下月內之產額。三十七種貨物中，計有陶器，竹器，人造絲，羊毛，玻璃，亞蔴，苧蔴，含鐵合金，不含鐵金屬物，藥劑，製藥設備，原料食物及飲料等等，其中有絲織品二千六百萬碼，乾香菌六萬一千捆以及酒瓶一百三十萬個。國際貿易局宣布盟軍總部巳爲美國商人安排起居，每日包括食宿爲美金十元。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京九日電〕麥克阿瑟元帥今宣布，八月十五日日本對外貿易恢復時，美·英·加三國可共派貿易商一百三十七人至日本貿易。</p>
<p>〔中央社東京八日合衆電〕日本商工相水谷長三郎談稱，關於日本私人國際貿易恢復後，外商代表之居住凖備工作，可於十五日前完成。貿易應長官永井小太郎在議會宣宣稱，日本之自由國際貿易，於和約簽訂後。即可恢復。恢復之後，日本或尙須限制外貨進口。又日政府今通知出入口商，如未得政府許可。不准私行訂立合同</p>
<h3>蘇繼續獨佔大連　美將再度提抗議</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓九日電〕國務院因蘇聯禁止美國海軍船隻進入大連而極感憤慨，目前已在考慮再度向莫斯科提出書面抗議。（按第一次照會於本年一月六日提出）。</p>
<p>蘇聯不顧中蘇條約中國應恢復主權之規定，以及中美雙方之反對，繼續佔領大連遷延兩年之久　美國在一月中送達莫斯科與南京之照會中，曾指出「大速爲何不能立即在中國管理下，開放國際貿易，實無理由」。又指出蘇聯之繼續佔領實爲「反常情形」並要求美國人應可訪問大連或在大連居住。</p>
<p>第二次抗議亦將爲同樣性質者，然措詞更當强硬。</p>
<p>中國政府亦曾向蘇聯提出强硬抗議，要求在大連成立中國行政機構，蘇聯答稱在對日和約未締結時，對日戰事狀態未算結束，故須繼續受蘇電之監視。國務院透露，自本年三月後，蘇聯當局即通知美方大連爲軍事管制下之封鎖港口，拒絕美國非武裝船隻經常訪問該港。美國外交方面之信件與供應品，即由蘇聯船隻送交美國總領事班寗霍夫，至目前止，領事尙可與美國當局通電，然亦必須經過蘇方。</p>
<h3>外蒙發表公報</h3>
<p>謂伙軍曾攻入蒙境</p>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科九日電〕塔斯社引述外蒙古人民共和國外交部發表之公報稱：本年內中國軍隊曾侵入蒙古共和國領土凡七次，其中五次發生於六七兩月份，每次人數約五百人。並稱：中國政府對於此類事件從不加以制止。關於疆界問題，蒙古政府可藉地圖證明蒙古邊界沿巴的克·賓格多（Bitik　Bogdo）山脈之巔劃定，此爲中國政府所爭持之點。</p>

<p>〔合眾社南京九日電〕魏德邁特使團將於星期一啟程赴台灣，調查該處狀況，蓋據報勝利後中國從日本手中接管台灣，由於處置失當，已使經濟效率大為減少。可靠方面語合眾社稱，魏氏對四戰，經濟崩潰，交通破裂及被蘇聯剝奪一空之工廠等惡化現象，印象良深。</p>

<h3>貫澈波茨坦宣言的精神</h3>
<p>— 方秋葦</p>
<p>自一九三五年八月十五日，日本接受波茨坦宣言無條件投降，到今年八月十五日，恰恰是二週年了，波茨坦宣言的要義，及其所蘊蓄的精神是什麼？它與締結對日和約有什麼關聯？我想作簡單的分析。</p>
<p>波茨坦宣言，是一九四五年七月二十六日，中美英三國領袖同意所發對日本的一種文吿，促其立即無條件投降。文吿列舉十三條，其第一至第五各條，警吿日本應認識德國無效果及無意識抵抗的結局（德國係一九四五年五月七日無條件投降），接受條件，勿一意孤行，陷於完全毀滅之境；其第六至第十三各條，即爲條件內容，約爲下列：</p>
<p>「六·吾人堅持非將負責之窮兵　武主義驅出世界，欺騙及錯誤領導日本人民使其妄欲征服世界者之威權及勢力，必須永久剔除，則和平安全及正義之新秩序勢不可能。</p>
<p>七·直至如此之新秩序成立時，及直至日本製造戰爭之力量業已毀滅有確實可信之證據時，日本領土經盟國之指定，必須佔領，俾吾人在此陳述之基本目的得以完成。</p>
<p>八·開羅宣言之條件，必須實施；而日本之主權必將限於本州，北海道，九州，四國，及吾人所決定之其他小島在內。（按：一九四三年十一月廿二日開羅宣言稱：三國之宗旨，在剝奪日本自從一九一四年第一次世界大戰開始後在太平洋上所奪得成佔領之一切島嶼。在使日本所竊取於中國之領土，例如東北四省，台灣，參湖羣島等歸還中國；其他日本以武力或貪慾所攫取之土地，亦務將日本驅逐出境。）</p>
<p>九·日本軍隊在完全解除武裝以後，將被允許返其家鄉，將有和平及生產生活之機會。</p>
<p>十·吾人鉀意如役日本民族或消滅其國家，但對於戰罪人犯，包括虐待吾人俘虜者在內，將處以怯律之裁判。</p>
<p>日木政府必須將阻止日本人民民主趨勢之復興及增强之所有障礙予以消除，言論宗敎及思想自由以及對於基本人權之重視必須成立。</p>
<p>十一·日本將被維持其經濟所必需及可以償付貨物賠款之工業，但可以使其重新武裝作戰之工業不在其內。爲此目的，可准其獲得原料，以別於統制原料。日本最後參加國際貿易關係，當可准許。</p>
<p>十二·上述目的達到，及依據日本人民自由表示之意向，成立一傾向和平及負責之政府後，同盟國佔領軍隊當即撤退。</p>
<p>十三·吾人通吿日本政府，立即宣布所有日本武裝部隊無條件投降，並對此種行動有意實行予以適當之各項保證。除此一途，日本即將迅速完全毀滅。」</p>
<p>最初，日本「密爲玉碎毋爲瓦全」的熊度，拒不接受波茨坦宣言，預備透過蘇聯的「中立」關係，進行和平停戰的交涉；可是到八月五日，美國第一顆原子彈投下廣島，表徵聯合國有使「日本即將迅沌完全毀滅」的能力，繼之蘇聯對日宣戰，美國第二顆原子彈又降落長崎，日本爲了避免完全毀滅的厄運，不得不屈膝投降了。八月十日，日本政府正式發出乞降照會，請託瑞士瑞典兩國政府，轉交中美英蘇四國，接受波茨坦宣言所列舉之條款；而附以一項諒解曰：「上述宣言不包含任何要朮有損失天皇陛下爲至高統治者之皇權。」十一日，美國國務卿貝爾納斯提出四强接受日本投降覆文，允諾日本上述之「諒解」而說明曰：「自投降時刻起，日本天皇及日本政府統治國家之權力，即須聽從盟國最高統帥之命令。……按照波茨坦宣言，日本政府之最後形式將日本人民自由表示之意願確定之。同盟國之武裝部隊將留於日本，直至波茨坦宣言所規定之月的達到爲止。」</p>
<p>十五日，日皇宣讀投降勅書，首相鈴木亦發表接受波茨坦，宣言之文吿，是日爲日本投降時刻，而波茨坦宣言十三條款，亦於比時刻起發生效力。</p>
<p>無論任何種戰爭，終不能永久不停止的，最後必須恢復和平的常態。交戰國一方全被征服，或交戰國雙方停止軍事行動，這祇是戰塲上戰鬥行爲的終止，而眞正消失戰爭狀態，恢復和平常態的關係，實有賴和約的締結，和約纔是終止戰爭的必經途徑。如第一次世界大戰，一九一八年十一月十一日簽訂休戰條約，協約國與德國之間，即終止了戰鬥行爲，無實際戰爭的存在，但戰爭之關係，待一九一九年六月二十九日凡爾賽和約簽字後，方始吿終。</p>
<p>日本接受波茨坦宣言，已經二年了，戰『行爲是終止了，但交戰國雙方的戰爭關係，迄今依然存在，有待和約的締結，最後恢復雙方和平常態。不過，日本的無條件投降，與前次德國休戰情形不同：一九一八年十一月十一日的休戰條約，德軍放下武器，停止戰鬥，休戰條約性質，有似國際公怯所謂的投降規約，乃軍隊軍艦城塞等的降伏，而波茨坦宣言條款，內載明交戰國間之請和條件，先時預不於敵方，敵方願意接受上述宣言條款，於正式和約締結之前，波茨坦宣言，乃係國際公法所謂的預備和約。</p>
<p>預備和約的本身，亦是個條約，它對於雙方都具有拘束力，且經過合法的承認手續。日本乞降接受波茨坦宣言，往來的文書，發表的文吿，以及要求的諒解，聯合國對於日本諒解的允諾，雙方都是經過合怯的承認手續。日本接受波茨坦宣言所列舉的條款，附以「上述宣言不包含任何要求有損失天皇陛下爲至高統治者之皇權」一項諒解，及貝爾納斯所稱「日本天皇及日本政府統治國家之權力，即須聽從盟國最高統帥之命令」覆文各點，可謂爲雙方之保留及聲明，應解釋它爲預備和約的追加條文，對於雙方具有同樣拘束力，幷與波茨坦宣言條款一樣，為正式和約締結的基礎。</p>
<p>在慣例上，預備和約往往是締結正式和約的基礎。必然的，對日和約的締結，以波茨坦宣言爲基礎，這是絲毫不能移動不能走樣的。現在許多人討論對日和約，甚至日本法界也討論和約了，但對神聖的波茨坦宣言的要義及其精神，大家都避而不談，那是很不妥當的事。我認爲波茨坦宣言，是一種預備和約，一九四五年七月二十六日中美英三國宣佈之日起，此項預備和約業已成立；一九四五年八月十五日，日本承認接受波茨坦宣言，此項預備和約業已發生效力。</p>
<p>波茨坦宣言的時效，是不可變遷的，第六至第十三條的精神，應全般貫注於未來正式和約以內，不折不扣。本來，「欺騙及錯誤領導日本人民使其妄欲征服世界者之威權及勢力」，指日本天皇及皇權而言，聯合國諒解了「天皇」權利的存在，並非諒解天皇權力的存在，因爲至高統治之權力，乃窮兵黷武主義之發軔，是不應存在的，必須永久別除。</p>
<p>正式和約締結後，並非「同盟國佔領軍隊當即撤退」的說明：第一，「直至日木製造戰爭之力量業已毀滅有確實可信之證據時」，尙需要一時期的管制和監視；第二，可以指定佔領日本領土，不完全佔領全國，如前次大戰和約後，協約國軍隊駐屯萊因河岸一樣，「直至波茨坦宣言所規定之目的達到爲止」；第三，「日本天皇及日本政府統治國家之被力，即須聽從盟國最高統帥之命令」，是隨天皇的保留而聲明存在，自然這是正式和約的要義所在，而未來的最高統帥，設置於天皇之上，是採總督制，抑採管理委員會的合議制，對日和會中應該討論，並列爲和約正式條款，否則便失頸備和約及其追加條文的精神了。</p>
<p>總之，波茨坦宣言不可變遷的，希望盟國對開羅宣言波茨坦宣言，深切研究，以爲正式和約的基礎。</p>

<p>〔聯合社惹九日電〕印尼總統索卡諾今日來此小駐，並向記者發表書面談話，籲請美國人民支持印尼要求荷軍撤退。據稱荷軍係受盟國配備對日作戰，而非對印尼從事全面殖民地戰爭。若能充分保證決不剝奪印尼早已獲得之自由，印尼政府仍擬與各國合作，包括荷蘭在內。</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖八日電〕菲律賓出席聯合國之代表羅幕洛稱：渠將車申參加安理會關於印尼間題之辯論之請求，其要求曾遭拒絕，渠已請安理會重新考慮其決定，蓋渠「認爲印尼之情勢發展，對菲之影響至大。」</p>
<h3>印尼總理呼籲勿再虐待華僑</h3>
<p>〔中央社巴達維亞八日電〕印尼總理夏利福亭頃向其人民呼籲，勿虐待印尼區內之華僑。屠殺破壞行爲，違反印尼政府政策，不許再發生。夏氏曾論及若十華僑曾被荷人利用，但對於爲向此少數人報復，而侵害全體華僑之一切行動，則嚴加指責。</p>

<h3>英經濟法案　週一作三讀辯論</h3>
<p>議會休會前可成爲法律</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕英國工黨政府，在其實施緊急措施以克服經濟危機之第一階段奮鬥中，業已獲得勝利。工黨政府今日已以一百二票之多數，在下議院二讀程序中，獲得其緊急方案之通過。工黨職員勃萊克明即汽車製造業中心伯明罕諾爾登區之代表，則與保守黨，自由黨及自由國民黨同投反對票。政府雖僅獲有二百五十一票，然是日列席下院之工黨議員幾均全部投贊成票，以今日爲星期五，依例列席議員較少，故政府原可獲得二百票之多數結果僅獲一百零二票之多數。保守黨於下星期一當　　攻擊該案，政府彼時當要求紫行三　辯論，使該案得於星期三議會休會以前，即能通過上議院而成爲法律。工黨議員組定於單期一開會討論該案，會後對於今日參加反對黨投反對票之勃萊克明，可能依黨律交付懲戒。</p>
<h3>英蘇兩國同意　恢復貿易談判</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕此間權威方面息：英國及蘇聯政府雙方均已開始行動，以恢復最近陷於僵局之貿易談判。英方首席談判代表國外貿易部大臣威爾遜謂英國業已採取主動行動，以使談判得以恢復，渠否認英國迫於美國之壓力，拒絕與蘇談判。今英蘇雙方雖已表示願意繼續談判，但恢復之日期尙未決定。</p>
<h3>經濟危機日益緊急聲中英閣有改組可能　艾德禮仍將擔任首相不致更動</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦九日電〕此間英政界人士預料英國內閣可能平日全面改組，以加緊領導英國之反經濟崩潰奮鬥，除艾德禮首相之地位似不致更動外，有魏議貝文外相將負責英國之工業及人力局勢者，蓋貝文與工業階級關係密切，戰時且當任勞工部長，故爲處理當前危機最理想之人物。然另一方面則謂貝文如非自願決不致調任他職，想渠個人亦願繼續供職外交部至少至十一月四强外長會議結束後爲止。至於外傳貝文將調任財相之說，各方仍疑信參半，蓋工黨秉政之初，貝文固嘗一度任財政大臣，惟歷時僅十二小時耳。至於財相道爾頓，久已有担任外相之意，故若貝文願意放棄外相之載，兩人之對調殊有可能。但生產大臣尙無着落，此一職之人選以現任商相克里浦斯比較最爲可能。若干工黨方面人士今已指出保守黨今日所要求之緊縮措施，正爲一年前保守黨批評克里浦斯所嘗竭力提倡者，故克里浦斯今日之地位，已較四閣任何其他人員可以少受攻擊，故領導反危機戰鬥之人，或當非克里浦斯莫屬云</p>
<h3>反對英政府徵利潤稅　美影片停止央　英電影院勢院被迫停業</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約八日電〕美國影片業公會今日議決立即停止裝遝長短片至英國。此項決議係因英財長道爾頓宣布美國影片在英開映，其利潤須徵稅百分之七十五一舉而起。美國影片在英放映每年獲利在五千萬元至七千萬元之間。據公會會長莊斯登宣稱：停運後何時恢復未定。同時據倫敦電，英國電影院同業公會秘書長福勒聲稱：美國製片商如果決定停止輸出，英國各地電影院共計四千五百所將於一年內室吿閉歇，英國製片商亦將無法放映國產片。目前英國每年出片約四十五部，佔放映影片總數百分之十，全部時間百分之二十。美團在英放映影片約四百另五部，佔全部時間百分之八十。</p>

<h3>美公私機關集中力量　檢討馬歇爾計劃　歐洲十六國將向美國提出建議</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓八日電〕馬歇爾之援歐計劃，由於歐洲十六個國家將提出建議，故此間政府及私人機關正趕作技術準備，以便能迅速採取行動。若干拉丁美洲國家中有美元匯兌危機者，希望援區之後果，產生一項「小規模之馬歇計劃」，可以適用於泛美國家間。外交界注意一月間在渡哥達會議中之經濟問題，顯然超過即將在巴西里約熱內盧開會所討論之安全問題。</p>
<p>日本，菲律演及其他遠東國家之復興需要，仍屬極大。其結果，研究此項問題之技術家必須同時牢記不屬於馬歇爾計劃範圍內之國家以及在起草此項計劃之西歐國家在內。此一情形之基本理由如下：（一）美國生產，就錮鐵及工業生產品方面言之，顯然不足以滿足全世界之需要。（二）由美興會撥款，僅能供給財政援助，由於有各種各類之非財政問題牽涉復興問題，將不足以解決西歡開題。（三）在商討馬歇爾計劃各國間，對於鼓勵德國工業復興達何種程度，尙無一致之意見。美國研究馬歇爾計劃專家，當歐洲各國交與美國之計劃提出時，可能亦有下列基本問題須待解決：（一）歐洲國家，對於其資源之利用，舉例方之，如煤斤之開採，究準備到何種程度。（二）美國經濟援助西歐國家，究至何種程度而不致促成美國國內及歐洲部分以外世界之新問題。（三）美國會及國內與論究允許援歐至何種程度。</p>
<h3>勃朗少將發表聲明解釋韓反托治運動</h3>
<p>〔新亞社漢城九日電〕朝鮮址五個團體組織之「臨時政府對策委員會」向勃期少將提出意見後，已引起美蘇變方代表在聯合委員會中激烈之爭辯。勃朗少將今日又為比發表特別聲明稱：蘇代表主張，凡不支持莫斯科宣言之團體，均不能參加協議。</p>
<p>但在一九四二年十二月廿四二南北朝鮮美蘇駐屯軍司令官之往來函件中，美國對是否將反託治團體除外問題，曾加修正，當時蘇方已接受此項原則，方開始協議。又在馬帥與莫洛托夫兩外長之協定中，亦對此未表示異議。朝鮮人民正渴望獨立之早日實現，彼等在遭受統治四十年之後，憂慮其國權之再受侵害，乃自然之爭理，蘇方對此點擬完全抹殺，致認韓人反託治即爲反對莫斯科決議，而在事實上，蘇方曾多方鼓勵韓人之愛國運動，於韓人表現其愛國意思時，又主張取消彼籌協議建立臨時政府之資格。莫斯科決議係將朝鮮交四國託治，然韓人憂慮此種政治是否即爲當初日本對朝鮮曾經實行之託治，此亦爲人情之常。美國始終爲朝鮮人民着，想完朝鮮成人民所渴望之建立獨立政府任務，余希望朝鮮人民及世界各邦均瞭解美國代表之此項主張。</p>

<h3>彷彿一部偵探小說　用紫外線鑑定血跡　余盛孝案真相大白　馬萊靴上泥土核與血地相同　卻利明日以強盜殺人罪解辦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於西入槍殺黑市黃金　客余盛孝一案，迄至昨日，業經警局採用科學偵查方法，及搜集種種證據，使狡點之凶犯，俯首無言。全案眞相，至此大白，其經過之曲折，與案情之複雜，可稱勝過一部福爾摩斯偵探案。</p>
<p>此次友案，得力於偵查之縝密，例如在汽車上以超度紫外透視法，獲得滲透於皮　上之血漬，同時復用化鑑定法，證明遺留於兇手馬萊褲襪上之血跡，為同一血型。此外復騐明在馬萊皮鞋上所積之黃土，與出事地點之泥土成份相同。根據上述種種證據，終使却利阿却無法狡辯，而將經遇詳情，和盤托出。</p>
<p>死者余盛孝，寗波人，年三十一歲，在四川路四五一號發達洋服店門首擺設美貨攤起家。稍有積蓄，改營黑市金鈔買賣，因此與「黃牛」英人却利相識。八月一日晨，有美軍官名馬萊者，與却利洽購金條五根，言明每條價格美金五百八十五元，相約當日下午三時交貨。當時却利以無現貨，轉商於余，乃一拍即合，約定在發達洋服店會晤。至下午一時，余準時前往，候至三時許，猶不見却利。當時余曾語店中人，謂此事若獲成交，可獲利二百萬元。猶謂却利遲遲不來，恐將成爲泡影矣。店中人尙見其將五根金條顯示於人，面現焦急之狀。正言談間，却利忽來，但使在門外兜一圈子，吹一口哨作爲暗示。余聞聲急出，即在路旁立談片刻後，余復返洋服店中。蓋却利已改約下午五時會晤矣。屆時，余與店中人不吿而別，從此遂吿失蹤。</p>
<p>鄉人目擊殺害情形</p>
<p>迨至六時許，突聞靑滬公路吳家巷發生一槍殺案，不料死者即爲余盛孝也。初，吳家巷地方，有居住第七保第二甲之鄉民朱義芳孫炳二人，正在青滬交界處，乘涼閒談，忽自東方傳來之尖銳車聲，正詫異閒，突見轎車一輛向東逸去，前後相差僅二分鐘。當時目睹駕車者爲身體健碩，蓄有小　之西人。車厢中另有一西人，正在坐勢上作揩抹之狀。事有凑巧渚，朱妻適於此時經過出事地點，忽見路旁有受傷者倒臥於血泊之中，初猶以爲汽車所傷，迨行近詢之，傷者始謂渠係槍傷。氏聞訊奔吿其夫，相偕至近七寳鎭自衛團報吿經過。迨由第一班班長姜志根趕往探視，傷者已氣息奄奄，僅說出渠名余盛孝，住天潼路六二三號，槍殺者爲英人却利。嗣即不省人事，迨車送紅十字會醫院時，半途即吿氣絕身死。</p>
<p>疲勞審問十二小時</p>
<p>當晚，本市警。初在其妻余陸氏處，獲悉却利爲一在中央路一帶經營黑市金鈔之「黃牛」，惟未悉居於何處。詢之同業中人，僅知却利有一意大利友人知其住處，於是在戶籍科中查出渠友人地址後，警局邀其合作，始於翌日下午六時，在陝西南路一八六弄十六號門口，將其捕獲。却利被捕之初，因過往渠曾在工部局時期任巡捕之職，故詞鋒銳利，善於作偽，矢口加以否認。後經警局召發達洋服店人指認無誤，復於三日上午帶同却利前住出事地點，由當時目睹之兩鄕人當面證明，駕車者確爲却利。至此，警局以案情已上軌道，遂開始採用「疲勞審問」，前後達十二小時之久，如是審訊復審訊，却利果於無意之中，忽透出殺余盛孝者，乃為美軍官馬萊，在百老匯大樓陸軍醫院內任伍長之職。並謂該輛轎車係向其另一友人處借來。警局獲得此訊，當夜即通知美國憲兵總部刑事稽查處，將馬萊扣押。一面復派員前往百老匯大樓，在馬萊之房間中，搜得褲子一條，襪子一雙，上均染有血跡。此外復在其皮鞋上，察得上面積有黃泥一層，事後與出事地點之泥土對照檢騐，成份完全相同。至此，美軍方面乃請求警局押解却利至美憲兵總部當面指認。却利之妻俄婦亦同往受訊。美軍事前特挑選與馬萊類似之十餘人，列成一排，由却利夫婦指認，當指出馬萊無誤。因此　一步獲得證明，渠等兩人實爲共犯。同時又據却利之妻承認，一日傍晚馬萊會至共家，並在　洗室中用水洗手</p>
<p>汽車來歷</p>
<p>却利　又在警局供出，渠等所用之汽車，係向居住匯中飯店之俄友鮑落夫所借用，號碼爲五三九二二。警局遂傳詢鮑洛夫，據稱：一日下午四時，却利至其寓所，謂將出埠遠遊，擬借車代步，當允所請。却利去後，至八時復返，車廂中則另有一人在，相偕至匯中休息良久。至十時許，却利復請求鮑落夫駕車相送。先送馬萊返百老匯大樓，繼送却利返陝西南路。</p>
<p>美軍憲兵隊獲此消息後，乃再請警局邀鮑洛夫前往指認，仍照以前辦法，果自十餘人中一索即得。</p>
<p>同時，警局復將汽車吊出，細加檢驗。坐墊皮作棕色，與血跡類似，非目力所能察得，乃利用超度紫外光透視法，獲血跡所在地，再配以化學鑑定怯，將褲襪上所留血跡對照，果求出同一血型。</p>
<p>同謀經過</p>
<p>卻利至此，遂不再獲獎辯，俯首無言，詳細供出與馬萊同謀經過。謂一日晨與馬萊相遇，欲購金條五根，乃商之余盛孝，約定五時交貨。事前馬萊命其借車至虹橋機塲。屆時，余盛孝與馬萊同坐於車廂中，由渠駕駛，至吳家巷時，突聞槍聲一響，馬萊隨即高呼「STOP」，急行煞車後，馬萊即開啓車門，將受傷之余盛孝用脚力蹴，自車中跌出路傍。至此，馬萊復命揮頭，向東逃逸。駛入上海市區後，先至渠寓所稍息，馬萊洗手後，始相偕再至匯中飯店，時爲八時。</p>
<p>警局偵訊至此以眞相大白，決定明日將却利以「强盜殺人嫌疑」移解地　法辦。關於此案偵查之出力人員，偵緝科長　　　，外事股長陶　榮，科員徐國基，幹員陳屬康，張金奎，巡官陳用中等，前後經八日之偵查，終獲破案，聞當局頗加嘉許云。</p>

<p>昨午十一時四十分，高檢處檢察官楊守成，典獄長徐崇文，升座特別刑庭第一庭，簽提蘇逆到案。蘇逆光頭，身材魁梧，着米黃色卡其香港衫短褲，足着白色鏤空短統綫襪，鏤空淺黃皮鞋，自知死期已至，面色慘白。惟仍强作鎭靜，咬其下唇，額角汗珠滲出。入庭即作諷刺之語調稱：「我眼前只看見一片黑暗，請把電燈開一開。」時正陽光强烈耀眼，檢察官知其諷刺，未予理睬。嗣供稱：「年四十七歲，山東濟寗人，住海格路五一四號，曾任偽上海市淸鄕事務局局長，偽上海市警察局副局長」等語</p>
<p>至死不悟</p>
<p>檢察官即訊問；「最高法院駁回抗吿裁定書你收到嗎？」答：「兩小時前收到了。」問：「今天本院奉令執行你知道嗎？」答：「你告訴我才知道。」問：「有遺言嗎？」答：「失節附逆係爲淪陷區人民，於心無愧，所懊悔者，當初未肯黑良心，以致現在家屬生活困難，早知如此，不如以前索性將心黑一黑。」庭上以其旣無遺言，即命執行，蘇逆請求將手銬鬆下，云：「我是基督敎徒，臨死前作一禱吿。」遂以手在胸前畫「十」字，口中唸唸有詞。</p>
<p>執行槍決</p>
<p>禱吿畢復行銬上，請求去銬未准，即由法警將蘇逆押至上海監獄刑塲執行，坐於頸置之木椅上，由法警翁雲泉舉盒子砲對後腦一槍，砰然一聲，彈自左腦射入，從鼻部穿出，蘇逆隨聲倒地，流血甚多，兩目張開，似猶未能瞑目也。下午二時其妻蘇夏氏趕來，將屍體運至中國殯議館收殮。</p>

<h3>戴維斯大使盛讚濟南市</h3>
<p>戴維斯大使，是一位最富有風趣的人物。他抵濟後首至大明湖，趵突泉等處遊覽名勝，對記者表示對濟南印象甚佳，他說，他眞想不到濟南在共軍包圍下有這樣好的秩序，好的街道，好的水，感到驚奇和愉快，（麗天）</p>
<h3>夜訪司徒大使</h3>
<p>〔本報特派員麗天五日濟南訊〕本月四日美大使司徒雷登加大使戴維斯偕隨員秘書等訪問濟南，在濟雖然只有兩天的逗留，但已帶給了每個濟南市人以最溫馨的友情，留下了最深刻的印像。司徒大使在濟南除在宴會席上兩度致詞，座談會上一度致詞，對濟市新聞界發表談話一次，對濟市各界公開講演兩次，並於百忙中單獨與本報記者長談，在許多談話中，司徒對中國國是的看法是這樣：</p>
<p>人口衆多，歷史悠久，得天獨厚（天時）物產豐富（地利）爲構成强國最有利的條件，而這許多條件，中國皆已具備。即就歷史上看：一些文明古國多已走向死亡，而中國却有着獨特的性格，屹立無恙。同時，按世界興亡路綫來講，自近東而西歐而美國以次類推，中國又將到臨强盛的階段，以目前世界環境來看，東方又是需要一個富强的國家來奠立永久和平的基礎，所以就各方面來講，中國是有希望的。</p>
<p>中國目前所遭遇到的唯一困難乃是「人事」，中國現在無外患，即有亦比較很小，問題完全是「內憂」，亦即所謂只有天時地利而乏人和。今天中國旣開始實施憲政，也就是中國歷史上最重要的一年。去年政府制憲，今年行憲，在此階段中，靑年人有最良好的機會以善盡其國民的責任。在民主政體下的人民，不但有權利，並且有責任。民主與專制不同，專制的政體不允許人民有組織以及發表意見的自由。</p>
<h3>迎使別記王耀武坐吉普車　一路簸到濟南</h3>
<p>王兼主席耀武一聽到美加兩大使已到濟南，特自五十餘公里外之奉安指揮所坐着吉普卡一路顚簸到濟南，戴大使因此深表感謝，他說要是他自已就是在地板上走，亦難勝此。（麗天寄自濟南）</p>
<p>王耀武與二大使濟南合影　本報特派員麗天奇</p>
<h3>知識青年快做先鋒　領導新革命運動</h3>
<p>他認爲今日的中國旣是個民主的政體，希望中國的知識青年要大大的覺悟，再做人民的先鋒，領導新的革命運動。使人民有組織有發表的自由和行使民主政治下所有的權利，這是今天知識靑年的責任。</p>
<p>所謂新的革命運動，並不是過去的革命述動，過去的革命運動，只講破壞，只講打倒；今天的革命運動，乃是建設性的革命運動。中國現已面臨破產階段，故應有一新的口號，凡是破壞，皆爲漢奸，皆爲賣國賊，愛國的應是建設的。反愚昧，反貧窮，反貪汚，反自私，反搗亂，反破壞。新的革命運動應該是合作的，團結的，進取的，改善的。</p>
<p>靑年人往往對現狀表示不滿，但這並非叫人悲觀，徬徨，獨善其身，自私自利，乃在叫人更爲國家更爲人民冒險萬難，刻苦努力，這樣，中國方不悲觀，方不失望。中國有一句諺語，我很贊同：「有志者事竟成，有爲者亦若是」。中國靑年如抱此熟望，深信必能較以前有更偉大更圓滿的貢獻。</p>
<h3>建設工作　單位小計劃小易着手</h3>
<p>四日深夜十時五十分，司徒和戴大使又單獨應本報記者之請，作了一次個別的訪問，司徒又吿訴了記者如下的珍貴意見：　「中國戰後建設工作的重點是在組織，使人民都能强固地組織起來，並且要有一個發表意見的機構，使人民的意見能表達出來，以集體的意見，進而轉化爲一種力量，有這種力量，就可以建設一切。同時，公民敎育亦很重要，俾藉此提高人民愛國情緒。中國勝利以來，建設的計劃很多，大多是全國性的，可惜內容多失之龐大而不切實際，致多無法實行。因此，遠不如從小的地方着手，由每一個小的團體的着手改良，慢慢的一步步做去，單位小，計劃小，容易着手，也容易進行，容易有成績，由城市而後擴充到鄉村，例如平津有一部份民敎工作者，在辛勤耕紜下，經十餘年，已由一個擴充至今天的廿九個民敎團體，並且有了比起始千百倍的羣衆。」</p>
<p>五日午後三時半記者送別兩大使離濟返京時，司徒大使操着流利的華語，一再鄭重地囑咐記者：「中國大多數人對目下國事似乎都很悲觀，都很失望，其實，中國的苦難一定會結束。忍耐一點，只要大家能組織起來，忍耐一點，一步步做去，人民要什麼，一定能得到什麼，中國人民的前途，一定是樂觀的！」</p>

<p>「第四區麵粉工業同業公會本年五月十六日粉呈字第二一四號呈，暨己皓電，均悉。查本年麥收之後，該會所屬各廠，生產增加。爲期京滬等地麵粉供應無缺，並使平津等缺糧地區，得以調劃起見，本部已」擬訂部份開放辦法，呈請行政院核示中。俟奉核定，滬市等地麵粉，即可按規定數量，准予報運轉口。所請將滬市麵粉轉口禁令，全部解除，未便照准。至各粉廠申請貸款一節，前據該會呈請到部，經另行批復在案，仰即遵照」。</p>

<p>棉布市况，以北帮裏足，華南遭水災，漢口帮銷滯，無意吸收，並傳日布市復僅及滬價之半，走私呢羢布疋，有來滬之可能性，故業中人均爭先競售，賣氣甚濃，市面一路下游。結果十二磅龍頭細布低至四十一萬一千元，比上月回跌九千元。五福藍鷄彩球陽鶴等各細布，亦均回挫五六千至八九千元。其餘漂布粗布嗶嘰及藍布士林布等，大都下挫，自二三千元至三萬元不一。</p>

<p>編輯先生：鄙人曩供職於敎育界。民三十二年，以敵寇盤踞無以爲生。不得己貸款隨友跑單帮。因係門外漢，致虧蝕甚鉅，遂將祖產（登記證係鄙人名字）低田十四畝高田八畝，抵借僞儲券四萬元，當時對方因恐幣制發生變化，不肯寫明錢數，鄙人在輕率急迫下，遂立八十担稻）當時稻價每石僞券五百元）借據一紙，並以高田八畝春秋兩熟，租穀各三石六斗，低田十四畝每年一熟秞稻十四石孳息，抵作前項借款利息。鄙人明知前項契約當時顯失公平，然滿擬次年如能稍獲薄利，即可備價收回。詎料次年秋，運貨蘇北泰縣，遇匪搶刧損失不貲，毫　俱盡。回贖之望已絕，擬將前項田產絕賣於債權人。彼等又借機貶値，若售諸別人，則債權人對於本金（即八十石秈稻）不肯讓步。鄙人心實難甘，擬進行訴訟，惟未知法律手續，敬請指示·讀者曹一平上。</p>

<h3>華南走私</h3>
<p>— 海風</p>
<p>你總應該承認梟商是「無孔不入的」只要有一天「黑市」存在，「走私」便無法取締。戰</p>
<p>時黃金即走私得利害。那時東南的黃金，比較重慶要便宜得多，空中挾帶黃金的案子，便成爲司空見慣的事。</p>
<p>現在港，滬的走私，他們更是神通廣大，不管那一條封鎖綫，他們可以用「金磚」和「法幣」把他打開來。你能說港滬沒有走私麼？　批的、大宗的，零星的，自有人專門在幹着這個行業。</p>
<p>你看八日本報本市新聞所載的十五萬萬元的港滬走私，不過是走私聲中，一個偶然被　　的例子而已。</p>
<p>你不能不承認那個應該歸還中國的「彈丸之地」的「香港」，已成爲華南「走私」的根據地。據香港海開監督公開宣稱：</p>
<p>「本年緝獲之走私案已達五百宗，相信此大走私，必有雄厚之强力組織，香港不願成爲走私基地，以妨碍中國經濟。」</p>
<p>據就近發生的兩樁走私案件，就有新疆輪走私案及佛山輪走私案；尤以後者規模宏大，爲一極有組織之行動。港粵本來近在咫尺，因輸入管制關係，香港貨物乃大批走私流入廣州。</p>
<p>「走私的對症下藥，唯一的辦法就是穩定物價與安定幣値，如若幣値，物價不穩定，「華南走私」一時將無法消　。</p>
<p>「香港」—所以成爲「走私」蜜座上的「天之驕子」，其基本原因亦即在此。</p>
<p>比如菲列賓資金大批走私澳門。這與中國法幣的彼動不無關係。</p>

<h3>我們眞的可以—挿翅飛行了</h3>
<p>— 明森譯</p>
<p>把你自己縛住在最新式的小型直昇機「好比拷背機」的座位裏，開動了在頭上旋轉的翼子，把握着「駕駛棒」，你就可以從你的院子裏出發去作兩百哩的飛行！‘</p>
<p>「好比拷背機」（HoppCopter）可說是一種袖珍式的直昇飛機（Helicopter），小而安全，又易駕駛，似乎具備着一切條件，頗可成爲一般男女單獨隨意飛行的工具。它僅重一百廿五磅，每架舊價約七百五十元（美金）——如果大量地生產起來，代價大概這可以降低一些。雅圖的「好比拷背機公司」董事長——霍雷斯·潘德考斯德（Horace　Pentecost）說「這種小型直昇機的功用和舒適程度，可與檢器脚踏車相提並論。」</p>
<p>潘氏已寫了一本小册子，名呌「獨人直昇機之經濟」，在其中說明這種飛行機實在比多數別的旅行工具還要易於使用。把你自己轉在座位裏——座下裝着三個昇降輪——引擎就在你肩後，而飛　則在頭頂上。需要顧管的，只有一個「駕駛棒」，它的柄就在你的正前方。</p>
<p>這駕駛棒是一根管子似的堅强粗樣，長約二呎半。它可以推上推下，推向前或拉向後，又可以轉動它。這樣，你就可以下降或上昇，向前進或向後退，或在空中盤旋——不必同時顧管到一大批的駕駛機構。</p>
<p>「好比拷背機」並不是一件玩具。它能够上升到一萬二千呎左右的高空中，每小時的速率可　九〇英里（90　Mlies）。在普通情形之下，如載重不逾二百五十飭，它可以迎續飛行二百哩。</p>
<p>最重要的，是這種飛機的安全性。如果一架一好比拷背機」的引擎出了毛病，它曾靜俏悄的盤旋下來，安然着地。</p>
<p>在一切飛行工具中開，尺有「好比拷背機」可能在經濟上比得過別種運輸方式。它的售價，只比一輛上等的新式機器脚路車稍稍大一點。七「品脫」的燃料就可充滿它的油箱，又不需要特別的塲地來供它降落或起飛。你自己家異的院子或附近的空地都可利用的。</p>
<p>你也不需要什麼飛機庫來藏放你的「好比拷背機』，因爲你現有的汽軍間很可以用了·而且據該機的一個創造者兼西，這種飛行機的運費不會很大，因爲很易把它拆開來，分裝在幾只大小方便的箱子裏。</p>
<p>說到使用它和維持它的費用，那簡直低廉得不能跟現有的飛行機相提並論，故爲一般小康之家置備得起。</p>
<p>關於「好比拷背機」的消息一傳出來，就有千萬人從世界各地去函詢問它的評情。「大家似乎都特別需要作安全便宜而可獨自操縱的飛行」，據潘德考斯德在他的小册子「獨人直昇機之經濟」中說：「在非洲內部傳敎的人在這種飛行機上看到了一種工具，可使他們不必再化幾星期的工夫，在原始叢林中砍出一條長僅數呷的通路來。美南洲的探險者認爲它是一個鎖匙，可以開啓一切不能逾越或通過的高山，密林，和沼地。大規模的牧殖家看到它可以代替「老馬」，用以巡邏他們那些一望無垠的牧塲。探礦者要用它去尋覓「上次幾乎找到了的礦脈」，不過多數人，連我自己在內，却只要它來作爲簡捷便宜的代步工具，在我們高興的時候立刻帶我們到一兩百哩以外去」！</p>

<h3>「吉人天相」中之　錦（上）「哀江南」中之周璇（下）</h3>
<h3>夜游示禁</h3>
<p>（錄自光緒廿二年七月十三日）</p>
<p>新世界以西，沿靜安寺路，五十年前，多為洋商住宅。夏令深宵乘馬車至靜安寺一帶兜風者，絡繹不絕，得得蹄聲，據人清夢。領事乃會同上海縣令，出一吿示云：</p>
<p>「爲查案示請事：　得靜安寺地方，自有茶肆花園，淤人得以憇息。車馬往來日衆，下　下夜，徹曉喧　，麟麟攘攘，不絕於耳。不特附近歴民，不能安枕，兼有地棍匪徒，從中攫物滋事，殊爲地方之憂。每逢夏令，游人納凉，祇圖時爽週，而深宵風露，剝膚侵肌，受之者深，發之者驟，夏秋疾疫之多，未始不由於此。須知日作夜息，古訓昭垂，豈可貪樂忘害，漫無限制。業經前分府會同本縣，示諭在案，茲屆夏令，合再查案曉諭為此示：仰靜安寺一帶茶肆遊人等知悉。自示之後，夜問茶市以十一點鐘爲限，一律停止。各該園丁，務於每夜十一點鐘，即　阻淤人入園，其已經到園各游人，仍分別催令出園。不得逾時，倘敢故違，定即提案究辦，決不寬貸。除飭差捕協保查禁外，本縣本分府爲綏靖地方起見，其各凜遵毋違，特示。」</p>
<p>上海夜市，由來已久，於今爲甚。嗚嗚之汽車聲，終宵不續，較昔日之車馬轔轔，更爲煩擾。蓋以版　日多，夜售凉飲，每以無線電爲號召，往往達旦不休。近日字林西報，寫爲社評，對於全市喧嘩之習，頗致不滿。若與上文對閱，可知此風亦非今日始也。（本報資料室輯）</p>
<h3>影壇一週</h3>
<p>— 李箴</p>
<p>新型的偵探片「回首話當年」</p>
<p>當那些陳腔濫調的偵探片已引不起觀衆興趣的時候，好萊塢的劇作家便另闢途徑。這部「回首話當年」便是採取了比較新鮮的形式。自然這個所謂新鮮，也不過是沒有用偵探或者獵犬出來破案而已。全劇用一個偵控小說的作家，他無意中聽到了一件離奇暗殺案，而死者恰是一個著名大盜，這樣便引起了他的好奇，他企岡追尋出這個大盜的一生事蹟，因此他遭遇了許多磨折與困難，也由於這位小說作家的到處尋訪材料，串連了全部故事。採用這樣形式來編製劇本，劇作者的原意是企圖着重在犯罪心理的描寫，但是在「回首話當年」中，這一點是寫得非常膚淺的，而實際上更重要的犯罪的社會原因，劇本中却全部忽略了。</p>
<p>導演對這個的的處理，確是超過了劇作的編製的，他聰明而風趣的運用了濃郁的人情味，尤其那海軍部小職員被騙初入睹塲與出賣地圖那幾塲戲，是全劇最精彩之處。</p>
<p>彼得勞雷的小說作家風趣而幽默，演來恰到好處。「殺人者」的男主角柴卡雷史寫脫，戲演得極乾凈。雪尼格林吏屈里的比德，穩重有餘，但無特殊成績，</p>
<p>技術上此片可算在水平綫上。</p>
<p>雜耍歌舞片「桃李芬芳」</p>
<p>「桃李芬芳」這是一部雜耍式的歌舞片。全片所要表現的，也就是這一對滑稽歌舞明星，琼黛維絲與賈克哈萊，再配上了美國鼓王琪恩克勞伯與電風琴女樂無伊漱兒史密絲。因此劇本中的故事，並不佔着重要的地位，其中吉兒與湯姆的戀愛故事，不過是襯托而已，甚至有些地方有點格格不相入。自然像這樣的雜要歌舞片，是很難要求其故事完整與合理化的，</p>
<p>但即使退一步來說，這部「桃李芬芳一依然只能屬於三流的歌舞片。導演對戲的處理，無法把握住整個的發展，尤其分</p>
<p>作爲娛樂看，僅僅只能從琼黛維絲與費克哈萊這一對滑稽明星的噱頭上去找代價了。</p>
<p>戈倍爾的情史「女性的仇敵」</p>
<p>顯然的，這是一部失敗的作品。不論從編劇，導演，以至於演員，全劇平淡而沉悶，簡直找不出精彩的地方。</p>
<p>劇本中以戈倍爾的事蹟構成了這個故事，企岡將納粹制度統冶下的德國人民的悲慘生活，給予暴露。但從影片上看來，也是極爲無力的。尤其對於戈倍爾這樣一個人物，浮光掠影的描寫給觀衆的印象，反而糢糊了。</p>
<p>演出上，保羅安道的戈倍爾景爲失敗，，不論在造型上，性格的刻劃，都沒有把握住這個人物。克勞蒂亞赫蘭克的瑪利，也僅有一二處較佳，唐納胡滋的漢士尙見辜穩。</p>
<p>導演對這個戲的失敗，應該負最大的責任的。</p>

<p>Communist Bandits in Songbei Mobilize All Forces to Drive the People and Expand the Rebellion</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 9th] The Communist bandits in Songbei have issued a general mobilization order and established a "General Mobilization Committee" in Harbin. Zhong Ziyun, the leader of the international faction of the Communist bandits in Songbei, is the chairman. All men and women between the ages of fifteen and forty are incorporated into the self-defense forces and backbone teams. Women are also incorporated into transportation teams and comfort teams, and children are formed into propaganda teams. All roads, large and small, are dug into tunnels, with the slogans "everyone is a soldier," "every village is a camp," and "every road is a battleground," driving the people to expand the rebellion.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 9th] After days of hard fighting, the National Army in northern Jilin has made further progress. Our commando team engaged in fierce fighting with the remaining Communist bandits in Xiaogutun and Yabatun outside Ula Street. The bandits have completely collapsed.

<h3>Communist Bandits Force Miners to Fight</h3>
<p>Two Thousand Sacrificed in the Battle of Siping</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 9th] According to news from Jilin, more than a thousand workers at the Naiyushan coal mine in the Communist bandit area of eastern Jilin launched an armed resistance movement at the beginning of the month because they were dissatisfied with the Communist bandits forcing them to join the army, killing six Communist bandit miners and foremen. Except for some of the miners who were detained and killed, most of the others escaped to the government area. It is reported that when the Communist bandits attacked Siping fiercely a month ago, they drove more than 2,000 miners from the Xi'an coal mine, giving each of them two hand grenades and forcing them to act as the vanguard. This group of good miners were completely sacrificed in the battle of Siping. This tragic fact has now spread throughout all mining areas in the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] The Changchun District Corps of the Youth League launched a "Hundred-Day Voluntary Donation Campaign" to raise funds through the group to provide relief to Siping.</p>
<h3>Fushun Situation Improves, Coal Production Increases</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 9th] The reporter went to Fushun with Special Envoy Wedemeyer on the morning of the 6th to inspect and deeply felt that Fushun has made significant progress compared with three months ago. Some streets have been gradually repaired and the city appearance is gradually becoming cleaner. Fushun's coal production has been affected by the war. The daily output in June and July was about 2,000 tons. It has now recovered to 4,000 tons per day. If the power supply is sufficient, production will continue to increase. Twenty oil refining furnaces are currently in operation, and expansion plans are also being gradually implemented. Since the Communist bandits' five offensives destroyed the Fengman transmission line to Shenyang, the Fushun Power Plant has become the only source of power for Shenyang, Anshan, Benxi, and other places. The original equipment could generate 290,000 kilowatts, but the Soviet army dismantled 210,000 kilowatts of machinery and equipment, leaving only 80,000 kilowatts of power generation capacity. Moreover, due to the old machinery and insufficient parts, the power generation last year was less than 20,000 kilowatts. It has now increased to 43,000 kilowatts. After the new machines are installed, the power supply problem in southern Northeast will be largely solved.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of the Ministry of Communications Discusses the Overview of Our International Air Transport</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Regarding the overview of our country's international air transport, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Communications:</p>
<p>(1) The allied countries that have signed international air transport agreements with our country: A. The Sino-US Air Transport Agreement was signed last December. Both sides have successfully carried out trial flights. The US side has officially opened the route, and our side will also officially open the route soon. B. The Sino-British Air Transport Agreement was signed on July 23rd. Trial flights to Nanyang, Singapore, and Batavia are being planned. C. Draft Sino-Dutch and Sino-Siamese Air Transport Agreements have been signed by representatives of both sides and are being submitted to the government for review. D. The Sino-French Provisional Agreement on Air Transport between Vietnam and China originally expired at the end of June this year, but has been extended to the end of this year with the consent of both parties. E. The Sino-Philippine Provisional Air Transport Agreement has expired and is being re-negotiated into a formal agreement. F. The Sino-Indian Air Transport Agreement was signed during the war and is being re-negotiated into a formal agreement.</p>
<p>(2) International routes currently flown by Chinese passenger planes: A. The Sino-US route: Shanghai to San Francisco. B. The Sino-Philippine route: Shanghai to Manila. C. Shanghai to Saigon. D. Kunming to Calcutta. There are currently not many passenger cars on each route.</p>
<p>(3) The Central Aviation Corporation currently does not have enough long-range aircraft. It originally planned to purchase two Constellation aircraft, but has not been able to purchase them due to the lack of foreign exchange approval. The China National Aviation Corporation only has six large passenger planes that can fly international routes, so in fact, it currently does not have enough capacity to operate all international routes. If the foreign exchange problem can be resolved quickly and new aircraft are added, the prospects for the prosperity of the international air transport routes operated by our country can be seen before us.</p>
<h3>Economic Reform Plan, Implementation Methods</h3>

<h3>Large-Scale Gold Smuggling from the Philippines to Macau, Value of Gold Bars Smuggled in Recent Days Reaches Two Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 9th] The Manila newspaper quoted Customs official Li Ang as saying that a batch of smuggled gold was transported to Macau by plane yesterday, but customs detectives failed to stop it. In the past ten days, gold coins and gold bars worth two million US dollars have been transported from Manila to Macau by aircraft of British and Philippine airline companies, using the export permits of the Philippine Sugar Administration as cover. Two detectives from the Manila Ministry of the Interior seized six gold bars yesterday, stamped with "London Johnson Foundry," with a fineness of .9999, worth US$21,000. A Chinese merchant has been charged with engaging in black market transactions.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaohsiung] The Tainan Customs seized the smuggling sailboat "Haiyan" off the coast of Budai Port. The ship was loaded with cowhide, cigarettes, paper, rubber-soled shoes, and pure caustic soda from Hong Kong, worth five to six million Taiwan dollars. The cargo was confiscated and the fourteen crew members are being held at the police station.</p>
<h3>The People's Constitutional Party Also Splits</h3>
<p>Key Figures such as Li Shengce and Hong Shaozhi Advocate Continued Cooperation with Zhang Junmai</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] The Democratic Constitutional Party and the National Socialist Party merged in August last year to form the Democratic Socialist Party. Less than a year later, it is recalled that the People's Constitutional Party declared its separation from the Democratic Socialist Party, which is chaired by Mr. Zhang Junmai, and split. According to Wu Xianzi, the person in charge of the People's Constitutional Party: "Although the People's Constitutional Party has withdrawn from Mr. Zhang Junmai's Democratic Socialist Party, it does not intend to restore the People's Constitutional Party's independence, but has decided to cooperate with the Reform Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party and continue to carry out legitimate activities in the name of the Democratic Socialist Party." He said: "The People's Constitutional Party no longer cooperates with Mr. Zhang Junmai because of various problems and disagreements within the party, and not because it intends to oppose the government. We are determined to contribute to national affairs in an opposition position in the future." When asked whether he intended to serve as the leader of another Democratic Socialist Party, he said, "If the National Congress convened by the Reform Committee makes this decision, he will be happy to consider it." There are also many within the People's Constitutional Party who oppose separation from Zhang Junmai. Other responsible persons of the party, such as Li Shengce and Hong Shaozhi, have stated that they will continue to cooperate with Zhang Junqin. Mr. Li is the President of the American Overseas Chinese Anliang Hall and the Supervisor of the Zhi Gong Tang, and his strength is sufficient to be regarded as important. Therefore, it is generally believed that the People's Constitutional Party has also split due to Wu Xianzi's decision, and that the party's strength has been greatly weakened by the fact that the party's strongmen do not act in concert with Wu.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Cui Xin, a spokesman for the Democratic Socialist Party, recently commented on the announcement of the separation by the Democratic Constitutional Party, saying: "The People's Constitutional Party issued a joint statement with the Reform Committee in Shanghai in the name of the overseas branches of the Democratic Socialist Party. In terms of its actions, it is like there are two People's Constitutional Parties, one made in the United States and one made in China." When asked whether Wu Xianzi can represent the overseas members of the Democratic Socialist Party, Cui replied: "Wu Xianzi absolutely cannot represent the overseas members. Zhi Daming can only rely on the overseas members to make himself important. It has aroused the anger of the representatives of the overseas members."</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Gazette Announces Scope of Trade with Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 9th] The Hong Kong Government Gazette published on the 9th the regulations on trade with Japan. From the date of promulgation, licensed merchants can resume trade with Japan, limited to the export and purchase of goods to and from Japan, and the receipt and payment of the value of the goods.

<h3>The Amount of Merchant Tonnage that Japan Should Compensate to Our Country Has Not Been Decided, Our Side Is Vigorously Striving for It in the Far East Commission</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] A spokesman for the Executive Yuan's Compensation Committee said: The amount of merchant tonnage that our country can receive as compensation is still under discussion in the Far East Commission because the tonnage of merchant ships that Japan can retain is still under discussion in the Far East Commission, so it has not been decided. It is also impossible to decide how much our country can receive. However, our country suffered heavy losses in ships during the War of Resistance, and we are now vigorously striving for preferential compensation from the Far East Commission to make up for the losses.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Circles Discuss Propositions on Trade with Japan, Advocate Prohibiting Imports of Textiles, and Demand Dismantling and Transporting Japanese Industrial Equipment as Compensation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th] After the government decided to open trade with Japan, all sectors of Tianjin have launched in-depth discussions. The Civil Governance Promotion Association, composed of famous figures from the cultural circles of Pingjin, invited the business community in Tianjin on the 9th to review the issue of trade with Japan. The heads of the Industrial Cooperation Association branch, the Import and Export Business Association, and the Textile Industry Association were invited to attend. Lu Yuwen, the business committee member of the Loan Committee who recently arrived in Tianjin, was also invited in his personal capacity. After President Zhang Bodai explained the significance of convening the meeting, Mr. Lu Yuwen spoke first, believing that from an economic point of view, trade with Japan should not be opened. However, from a political point of view, our country has no reason to continue to close its doors to Japan. What we should devote ourselves to at present is to prove to the world that once China is invaded, it will have a major impact on world security, in order to win international aid and develop our country's economy to achieve the goal of freedom and independence. After the resumption of trade with Japan, the biggest conflict of interest between China and Japan will be in the textile industry, because Japan's main exports are textiles, which will inevitably affect our textile industry. Therefore, when opening trade with Japan, it should not be allowed to import its textiles. Yang Yizhou, manager of Zhongfang Tianjin, emphasized that once China's textile industry is attacked, the entire national economy will not be able to develop. He advocated that trade with Japan should be carried out on a barter basis according to our country's needs. The chairman of the Tianjin Industrial Cooperation Association branch put forward his thorough proposition:</p>
<p>Chinese people have the right to demand the dismantling and transportation of Japanese factories for Chinese needs as compensation. Since Japan has surplus textile machines to export, how can we dismantle and transport its textile equipment? Since Japan needs China to supply sea salt, how can we dismantle and transport its alkali factories? Taking the alkali industry as an example, China's annual production before the war was 120,000 tons. At that time, Yongli's daily output was 200 tons. Now, due to the Japanese brutal use of the equipment for eight years, the daily output has been reduced to 80 tons, and there is a possibility of danger at any time. Once Yongli collapses, the entire national chemical industry will be in dire straits. In this situation, dismantling and transporting Japanese equipment is the best policy." Wang Ruiji, deputy manager of Zhongfang Tianjin, said that textiles account for 75 percent of Japan's export plan to our country, and this amount will directly manipulate the prosperity and decline of our national economy. Chen Yihou, chairman of the Bankers Association, said that before the war, Japanese yarn was dumped in China, which once made our country's cotton price higher than the yarn price. This past situation is thought-provoking. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to send a telegram to the central government, prohibiting the import of Japanese products that endanger our country's industry, and demanding the dismantling and transportation of Japanese factory equipment. Tianjin should have a considerable number of people on the business inspection delegation to Japan.</p>

The Japanese government today notified importers and exporters that they are not allowed to enter into contracts privately without government permission.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Continues to Occupy Dalian; US to Lodge Another Protest</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 9th] The State Department is deeply angered by the Soviet Union's prohibition of American naval vessels from entering Dalian and is currently considering lodging another written protest with Moscow. (Note: The first note was submitted on January 6th of this year).</p>
<p>Disregarding the Sino-Soviet Treaty's stipulation that China should regain sovereignty and despite objections from both China and the United States, the Soviet Union continues to occupy Dalian for two years. In the notes delivered to Moscow and Nanjing in mid-January, the United States pointed out that "there is no reason why Dalian cannot be immediately placed under Chinese administration and open to international trade." It also stated that the Soviet Union's continued occupation is an "abnormal situation" and demanded that Americans should be able to visit or reside in Dalian.</p>
<p>The second protest will be of the same nature but worded more strongly.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has also lodged a strong protest with the Soviet Union, demanding the establishment of a Chinese administrative organ in Dalian. The Soviet Union replied that until a peace treaty with Japan is concluded, the state of war with Japan has not ended and therefore must continue to be under Soviet surveillance. The State Department revealed that since March of this year, the Soviet authorities have notified the U.S. that Dalian is a closed port under military control, refusing regular visits to the port by unarmed American ships. American diplomatic mail and supplies are delivered to U.S. Consul General Benninghoff by Soviet ships. To date, the Consul can still communicate with U.S. authorities by telegram, but it must also go through the Soviets.</p>

<h3>Special Envoy Group Studies Northern Data; Wedemeyer Avoids Meeting with Sun Fo; Lengthy Two-Hour Discussion Covered a Wide Range of Topics</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The U.S. Embassy announced that on the 9th, Wedemeyer only received one Chinese guest, Xi Enshui, the Chief of Transportation of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, and made one visit, meeting with Vice President Sun Fo at his Wuyi Road residence. In addition to discussions with American officials at the embassy in the morning, the rest of his time was spent at Ambassador Stuart's residence, studying the data obtained from North and Northeast China and the documents received during his absence from Nanjing. This study will occupy most of the attention of the entire mission until at least the 10th. According to current plans, the mission will depart on the 11th for trips to Taiwan and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Wedemeyer received General Xi Enshui, his West Point classmate, at around 9 AM on the 9th for about an hour. According to Xi, he later said that it was just a friendly meeting. After Xi left, Wedemeyer, accompanied by translator Captain Wu Hanmin, visited Vice President Sun Fo for the first time, having a long talk of about two hours, which reportedly covered a wide range of topics.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] General Wedemeyer and his entire team were very busy on the 9th, sorting through a large amount of data and documents brought back from North and Northeast China. All items had to be opened, their nature examined, and categorized and summarized for registration. According to a member of the mission who spoke with reporters, a large portion of the letters from the Northeast and North China were written by homeless refugees, some of whom were illiterate and had asked others to write on their behalf. The mission was deeply impressed by the vast and untapped potential of the Fushun mines. It is estimated that if given ten years, it will surpass Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. However, the team also discovered some real difficulties and generally poor conditions and has paid attention to the contradictory situation in the Northeast. The data obtained by the mission in China will be systematically organized in Nanjing and Washington. Both locations have excellent translators. It is expected that they will return to the U.S. ten days after leaving China, and this work can be completed en route via Hawaii. The mission's achievements in China have reached the peak of what they could achieve, and the results are quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Nanjing, 9th] The Wedemeyer Special Envoy Mission will depart for Taiwan on Monday to investigate the situation there, as reports indicate that China's takeover of Taiwan from Japan after the victory has led to a significant reduction in economic efficiency due to mismanagement. Reliable sources told UPI that Wedemeyer was deeply impressed by the deteriorating conditions of the four years of war, economic collapse, transportation breakdown, and factories stripped bare by the Soviet Union.</p>

(3) The Communist Party is intent on destruction, causing the nation's economy, construction, transportation, etc., to be unable to achieve the ideal, and the central government has made decisions on this matter to stabilize the economy and promote construction in order to achieve stability. (4) Xikang has made many contributions during the war. Since Chairman Liu took charge of Xikang, he has overcome all difficulties, and it is not easy for a poor border province to achieve such results. This is the result of the integration of the people and the government. Furthermore, Chairman Liu's management of Xikang's administration and his plans for Tibet are unique and are in line with Chairman Chiang's nation-building plan. I hope that the compatriots in Kang Province will work harder under the leadership of Chairman Liu.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Ya'an, 9th] Director Zhu Shaoliang has completed a stage of his inspection in Xikang. Today at 7 AM, he led his entourage from Ya'an to Leshan, Yibin, Luxian, and other places to inspect the Kunming and Guiyang areas. Before his departure, Zhu said that he had been in charge of the northwest border administration for many years and was very clear about all the special and difficult situations in the border provinces. The difficulty of governing them cannot be compared to the interior provinces. Therefore, the observation of the border provinces cannot be viewed from the perspective of the prosperity of the major cities in Beijing and Shanghai. The establishment of Xikang Province in these short eight years has seen the construction of highways, the establishment of factories, the development of industry and mining, and other modern constructions, which is truly not easy. Furthermore, Xikang is quiet and safe during the recent student and rice riots, which also shows the result of the integration of the people and the government, which is especially commendable.</p>

<h3>Kawashima Yoshiko Retracts Confession; Hebei High Court Held Investigative Hearing Yesterday; Kawashima Stubbornly Denies Evidence</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 9th] The Hebei High Court held a hearing on the afternoon of the 8th to investigate the crimes of international female spy Kawashima Yoshiko. Kawashima wore prison clothes and was fatter than before. Due to dental problems, her speech was unclear. She completely overturned her previous confession at the Military Intelligence Bureau. Regarding being called Commander Jin, she explained that she received enemy bushido training since she was young. Because her father was a commander, people called her Little Commander, which made her feel very happy. This was misreported until now. The court presented her with a photo of her wearing a general's uniform and asked what it meant. She replied that she wore it for fun. The so-called promotion to general in Showa 15 of Japan did not happen, and she denied having served as the female officer of the Empress of Manchukuo and the supervisor of students studying in Japan, saying that there was no such official system. She admitted to knowing Tada Shun and Matsuoka Yosuke because the two were friends of Kawashima Naniwa. The wife of Kawashima Naniwa was related to the Japanese Empress, and Naniwa and Prince Su were sworn brothers, so she recognized Naniwa as her adoptive father. Naniwa had served as an advisor to the Qing Dynasty. The name Jin Bihui was given by the Manchukuo royal family. When asked about her rank with Puyi, she did not answer, only saying that when Japan proposed the Twenty-One Demands to China at the age of sixteen, Jin was scolded by aristocratic classmates as not being Japanese, so she returned to China in anger. Due to hardship in life, she was taken to Changchun by her brother Jin Bidong. She replied that she did not know the details of the establishment of Manchukuo, saying that the outside world's reports were reporters' fabrications. When asked about going to Beijing to testify, she said that she was deceived by Director Zou, and all the confessions were written by Zou and she did not meet Takahashi. She also claimed that she loved the country the most and had rescued underground Jiang personnel. In short, for all unfavorable parts, she claimed ignorance and searched for all kinds of favorable parts.</p>

<h3>Upholding the Spirit of the Potsdam Declaration</h3>
<p>— Fang Qiushi</p>
<p>From August 15, 1945, when Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration and surrendered unconditionally, to August 15 of this year, exactly two years have passed. What is the essence of the Potsdam Declaration, and what is the spirit it embodies? What is its connection to the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan? I would like to offer a simple analysis.</p>
<p>The Potsdam Declaration was a document issued on July 26, 1945, by the leaders of the United States, China, and Great Britain to Japan, urging its immediate unconditional surrender. The document listed thirteen articles. Articles one through five warned Japan to recognize the outcome of Germany's ineffective and senseless resistance (Germany surrendered unconditionally on May 7, 1945), accept the conditions, and not persist obstinately, thereby falling into a state of utter destruction. Articles six through thirteen contained the conditions, which were roughly as follows:</p>
<p>"6. We insist that the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be permanently eliminated, for we hold that a new order of peace, security and justice is impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world.</p>
<p>7. Until such a new order is established and until there is convincing proof that Japan's war-making power is destroyed, points in Japanese territory to be designated by the Allies shall be occupied to secure the achievement of the basic objectives we are here setting forth.</p>
<p>8. The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out and Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine. (Note: The Cairo Declaration of November 22, 1943, stated: The purpose of the three countries is to deprive Japan of all the islands in the Pacific which she has seized or occupied since the beginning of the First World War in 1914, and that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Manchuria, Formosa, and the Pescadores, shall be restored to the Republic of China. Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed.)</p>
<p>9. The Japanese military forces, after being completely disarmed, shall be permitted to return to their homes with the opportunity to lead peaceful and productive lives.</p>
<p>10. We do not intend to enslave the Japanese as a race or to destroy them as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners.</p>
<p>The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established.</p>
<p>11. Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war. To this end, access to, as distinguished from control of, raw materials shall be permitted. Japan shall be permitted eventually to participate in world trade relations.</p>
<p>12. The occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people a peacefully inclined and responsible government.</p>
<p>13. We call upon the Government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction."</p>
<p>Initially, Japan, with a "better to be a shattered jewel than an intact tile" attitude, refused to accept the Potsdam Declaration, and prepared to negotiate a peaceful armistice through the "neutral" relationship with the Soviet Union. However, on August 5, the United States dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, demonstrating the Allied forces' ability to bring about "prompt and utter destruction" to Japan. Subsequently, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, and the United States dropped the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki. In order to avoid the calamity of complete destruction, Japan had no choice but to surrender. On August 10, the Japanese government formally issued a surrender note, requesting the governments of Switzerland and Sweden to forward it to the United States, China, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union, accepting the terms listed in the Potsdam Declaration. However, it attached an understanding, stating: "The above declaration does not include any stipulations that would prejudice the prerogatives of His Majesty as Sovereign Ruler." On August 11, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes presented a reply from the four powers accepting Japan's surrender, agreeing to Japan's above-mentioned "understanding" while explaining: "From the moment of surrender the authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers who will take such steps as he deems proper to effectuate the surrender terms. ... The ultimate form of government of Japan shall, in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration, be determined by the freely expressed will of the Japanese people. The armed forces of the Allied Powers will remain in Japan until the purposes set forth in the Potsdam Declaration are achieved."</p>
<p>On August 15, the Emperor of Japan read the surrender rescript, and Prime Minister Suzuki also issued a statement accepting the Potsdam Declaration. This day marked the moment of Japan's surrender, and the thirteen articles of the Potsdam Declaration took effect from that moment.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of war it is, it cannot last forever; it must eventually return to a normal state of peace. The complete conquest of one belligerent party, or the cessation of military action by both belligerent parties, is only the end of fighting behavior on the battlefield. The true disappearance of the state of war and the restoration of normal peaceful relations depend on the conclusion of a peace treaty. A peace treaty is the necessary path to ending a war. For example, in the First World War, the Armistice Treaty was signed on November 11, 1918, and the fighting behavior between the Allied Powers and Germany ended, with no actual war existing. However, the state of war did not end until the Treaty of Versailles was signed on June 29, 1919.</p>
<p>Two years have passed since Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration. The fighting behavior has ended, but the state of war between the belligerent parties still exists and awaits the conclusion of a peace treaty to finally restore normal peaceful relations. However, Japan's unconditional surrender is different from the armistice situation of Germany in the past. The Armistice Treaty of November 11, 1918, saw the German army lay down its weapons and cease fighting. The nature of the armistice treaty was similar to what is known in international law as a capitulation agreement, which is the surrender of armies, warships, fortresses, etc. The Potsdam Declaration, however, contains the conditions for peace between the belligerents, which are pre-announced to the enemy. If the enemy is willing to accept the terms of the declaration, the Potsdam Declaration, before the formal conclusion of a peace treaty, is what is known in international law as a preliminary peace treaty.</p>
<p>A preliminary peace treaty is itself a treaty that is binding on both parties and has gone through legitimate recognition procedures. Japan's surrender and acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration, the exchange of documents, the issuance of statements, and the requested understanding, and the Allied Powers' acceptance of Japan's understanding, all went through legitimate recognition procedures by both parties. Japan accepted the terms listed in the Potsdam Declaration, with the understanding that "the above declaration does not include any stipulations that would prejudice the prerogatives of His Majesty as Sovereign Ruler," and Byrnes' statement that "the authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers," can be regarded as reservations and declarations by both parties, and should be interpreted as additional articles to the preliminary peace treaty, which are equally binding on both parties and, like the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, form the basis for the conclusion of a formal peace treaty.</p>
<p>In practice, a preliminary peace treaty is often the basis for the conclusion of a formal peace treaty. Inevitably, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan must be based on the Potsdam Declaration, which cannot be changed or distorted in any way. Now, many people are discussing a peace treaty with Japan, and even legal circles in Japan are discussing a peace treaty, but everyone avoids talking about the essence and spirit of the sacred Potsdam Declaration, which is very inappropriate. I believe that the Potsdam Declaration is a preliminary peace treaty. This preliminary peace treaty was established on July 26, 1945, when the United States, China, and Great Britain announced it. On August 15, 1945, Japan recognized and accepted the Potsdam Declaration, and this preliminary peace treaty became effective.</p>
<p>The validity of the Potsdam Declaration is immutable. The spirit of Articles 6 to 13 should be fully incorporated into the future formal peace treaty, without any compromise. Originally "the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking upon world conquests" referred to the Emperor of Japan and the imperial power. The Allies accepted the existence of the "Emperor" but not the existence of the Emperor's power, because the power of supreme rule is the beginning of militarism and should not exist and must be permanently eliminated.</p>
<p>After the formal peace treaty is concluded, it does not mean that "the occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan immediately." First, "until there is convincing proof that Japan's war-making power is destroyed," a period of control and surveillance is still needed. Second, it is possible to designate the occupation of Japanese territory, not the complete occupation of the entire country, just as after the peace treaty of the last war, the Allied forces were stationed on the banks of the Rhine River, "until the purposes set forth in the Potsdam Declaration are achieved." Third, "the authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Government to rule the state shall be subject to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers" is a statement that exists following the Emperor's reservation. Naturally, this is the essence of the formal peace treaty, and the future Supreme Commander, whether it is a governor-general system or a collegial system of a management committee, should be discussed at the peace conference and listed as a formal clause in the peace treaty; otherwise, it will lose the spirit of the preliminary peace treaty and its additional articles.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Potsdam Declaration is immutable. It is hoped that the Allied Powers will deeply study the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration as the basis for a formal peace treaty.</p>

<h3>Indonesia and the Netherlands Blame Each Other for Violating the Ceasefire Order. The Java War Turns Fierce. Indonesia Threatens to Re-adopt the Scorched Earth Policy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 9th] Indonesian and Dutch reports on the 9th stated: The most fierce war since the ceasefire has occurred between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The Netherlands accused 300 Indonesian soldiers of attacking Dagaki near Surabaya within the ceasefire zone. Another group of Indonesian troops attacked Kongba near Sambo. Indonesian reports accused Dutch troops of occupying Tobocha in East Java on the 8th. It is claimed that Dutch troops retreated after killing a few Indonesian soldiers. The Indonesian side has warned that they will resume the scorched earth policy unless the Dutch offensive stops. The Dutch reports said that Indonesian troops are still looting and burning. It is claimed that Jiabanjiaxi village, 40 miles south of Miannan, was destroyed by Indonesian troops, and several villages and towns on Sumatra Island were also looted.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 9th] After consultation with the Indian government and the interim government of Pakistan, the Indian military headquarters in New Delhi has ordered a ban on the shipment of all military supplies and equipment originally scheduled to be transferred to the Netherlands from Indian ports.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 8th] Former Indonesian Prime Minister Shari arrived here on the evening of the 8th. In addition to claiming that "this trip is to present Indonesia's case to the United Nations," Shari refused to make further comments.</p>
<p>[United Press, Jiayi, 9th] Indonesian President Sukarno made a brief stop here today and issued a written statement to reporters, calling on the American people to support Indonesia's demand for the withdrawal of Dutch troops. It is claimed that the Dutch troops were equipped by the Allies for the war against Japan, not to engage in a full-scale colonial war against Indonesia. If full assurances can be given that Indonesia's freedom already obtained will not be deprived, the Indonesian government is still willing to cooperate with all countries, including the Netherlands.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 8th] Philippine representative to the United Nations, Romulo, said that he would re-apply to participate in the Security Council's debate on the Indonesian issue. His request had been rejected. He has asked the Security Council to reconsider its decision, because he "believes that the developments in the Indonesian situation have a great impact on the Philippines."</p>
<h3>Indonesian Prime Minister Calls for an End to the Mistreatment of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 8th] Indonesian Prime Minister Shari Futing recently called on his people not to mistreat overseas Chinese in Indonesia. Acts of massacre and destruction violate the policies of the Indonesian government and must not happen again. Shari mentioned that some overseas Chinese had been used by the Dutch, but he strongly condemned all actions that harmed the entire overseas Chinese community in retaliation for the actions of a few.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Batavia, 8th] The Batavia Chinese General Association today appealed to Xia Jinlin, the representative of the United Nations, stating that no matter what steps the Security Council takes, it must ensure the safety of the lives of minorities. We can no longer trust the promises and guarantees made by the Republican government, so we can only appeal to the Security Council in the name of humanity and justice. Please take the protection of overseas Chinese as the first prerequisite when resolving the Indonesian issue.</p>
<h3>British Economic Bill to be Debated for the Third Reading on Monday</h3>
<p>Can Become Law Before Parliament Adjourns</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] The British Labor government has achieved victory in the first stage of its struggle to implement emergency measures to overcome the economic crisis. The Labor government today secured the passage of its emergency program in the House of Commons' second reading process by a majority of 102 votes. Labor official Blackman, representative of the Birmingham Norden district, a center of the automobile manufacturing industry, voted against it along with the Conservatives, Liberals, and Liberal National Party. Although the government only obtained 251 votes, almost all Labor MPs present in the House of Commons voted in favor. As today is Friday, and fewer MPs are present according to custom, the government could have obtained a majority of 200 votes, but only obtained a majority of 102 votes. The Conservatives will attack the bill next Monday, and the government will then request a third reading debate, so that the bill can be passed by the House of Lords and become law before Parliament adjourns on Wednesday. The Labor MPs are scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss the bill. After the meeting, Blackman, who participated in the opposition party's vote against the bill today, may be subjected to disciplinary action according to party rules.</p>
<h3>Britain and the Soviet Union Agree to Resume Trade Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 8th] Authoritative sources here say: Both the British and Soviet governments have begun to act to resume trade negotiations that have recently reached a stalemate. British chief negotiator Wilson, Minister for Overseas Trade, said that Britain has taken the initiative to resume negotiations. He denied that Britain was forced by pressure from the United States to refuse negotiations with the Soviet Union. Although both Britain and the Soviet Union have expressed their willingness to continue negotiations, the date of resumption has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Amid the Increasingly Urgent Economic Crisis, a Reshuffle of the British Cabinet is Possible. Attlee will Still Serve as Prime Minister and Will Not Change.</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 9th] British political figures here expect that the British cabinet may be fully reshuffled in the coming days to strengthen the leadership of Britain's struggle against economic collapse. With the exception of Prime Minister Attlee's position, which seems unlikely to change, it is rumored that Foreign Minister Bevin will be responsible for Britain's industrial and human resources situation. Because Bevin has close relations with the industrial class and served as Minister of Labor during the war, he is the most ideal person to deal with the current crisis. However, on the other hand, it is said that Bevin would never transfer to another position unless he was willing. He himself would like to continue to serve in the Foreign Office, at least until the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference ends in November. As for the rumors that Bevin will be transferred to become Chancellor of the Exchequer, opinions are still divided. Although Bevin did serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer briefly at the beginning of the Labor Party's administration, it only lasted for twelve hours. As for Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, he has long had the intention of becoming Foreign Minister, so if Bevin is willing to give up the position of Foreign Minister, the exchange of positions between the two is very likely. But the position of Minister of Production is still undecided. The most likely candidate for this position is the current Minister of Trade Cripps. Some Labor Party figures have pointed out today that the austerity measures demanded by the Conservative Party today are exactly what Cripps tried to promote a year ago, which the Conservative Party criticized. Therefore, Cripps' position today is less vulnerable to attack than any other cabinet member, so the leader of the anti-crisis battle may be none other than Cripps.</p>
<h3>In Opposition to the British Government's Profit Tax, American Films Stop Entering. British Cinemas are Forced to Close</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 8th] The American Film Export Association decided today to immediately stop shipping films, both short and long, to Great Britain. This resolution was caused by British Chancellor Dalton's announcement that American films shown in Britain would be subject to a 75 percent tax on profits. American films generate profits of between 50 million and 70 million U.S. dollars annually in Britain. According to Association President Johnston, the resumption date after the suspension has not been determined. At the same time, according to a London dispatch, Fowler, Secretary-General of the British Film Institute, claimed that if American film producers decide to stop exporting, a total of 4,500 cinemas across Britain will be forced to close within a year, and British film producers will also be unable to screen domestic films. Currently, Britain produces about 45 films annually, accounting for about 10 percent of the total number of films screened and 20 percent of the total time. American films account for about 405 films screened in Britain, accounting for 80 percent of the total time.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 9th] Curtin, a representative of Universal Pictures, stated at a press conference here today that the heavy tax imposed by Britain on films imported from the United States has sown the seeds of discord between Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3>Indian Ambassador Visits Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 8th] Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mrs. Pandit, visited the Soviet Foreign Ministry this afternoon and was received by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky for a sincere talk.</p>
<h3>American Public and Private Institutions Concentrate Their Efforts to Review the Marshall Plan. Sixteen European Countries Will Submit Proposals to the United States</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 8th] Due to the proposals to be submitted by sixteen European countries, the American Marshall Aid Plan, the government and private organizations here are rushing to prepare technically so that they can take action quickly. Some Latin American countries with US dollar exchange crises hope that the consequences of the aid zone will produce a "small-scale Marshall Aid Plan" that can be applied to Pan-American countries. The diplomatic community's attention to economic issues at the Bogota Conference in January clearly exceeds the security issues to be discussed at the upcoming meeting in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>
<p>The needs for reconstruction in Japan, the Philippines, and other Far Eastern countries are still enormous. As a result, the experts studying this issue must keep in mind at the same time countries that are not within the scope of the Marshall Plan as well as Western European countries when drafting this plan. The basic reasons for this situation are as follows: (1) American production, in terms of steel and industrial products, is clearly insufficient to meet the needs of the whole world. (2) Appropriations from the US Congress can only provide financial assistance. Since various types of non-financial problems are involved in the reconstruction issue, it will be insufficient to solve the problem of Western Europe. (3) There is no consensus among the countries discussing the Marshall Plan on the extent to which German industrial reconstruction should be encouraged. American experts studying the Marshall Plan may also have the following basic issues to be resolved when the plans submitted by the European countries are submitted to the United States: (1) To what extent are European countries prepared to utilize their resources, for example, coal mining. (2) To what extent will American economic aid to Western European countries not lead to new problems in the United States and the world outside of parts of Europe. (3) To what extent will the US Congress and domestic public opinion allow aid to Europe.</p>
<h3>Major General Brown Issues a Statement Explaining the Anti-Trusteeship Movement in Korea</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 9th] The opinions submitted by the "Countermeasures Committee for the Provisional Government" organized by five groups in Korea to Major General Brown have aroused fierce debates among the representatives of the US and the Soviet Union in the Joint Committee. Major General Brown issued a special statement today explaining this matter again, stating that the Soviet representative argued that any group that does not support the Moscow Declaration should not participate in the agreement.</p>
<p>However, in the exchange of letters between the commanders of the US and Soviet garrison troops in North and South Korea on December 24, 1942, the United States modified the issue of whether to exclude anti-trusteeship groups. At that time, the Soviet side accepted this principle before the agreement began. Also, in the agreement between Foreign Minister Marshall and Molotov, there was no objection to this. The Korean people are eagerly awaiting the early realization of independence. After suffering 40 years of rule, they are naturally worried about the re-infringement of their national sovereignty. The Soviet side intends to completely deny this point, and believes that the Korean people's anti-trusteeship is opposition to the Moscow resolution. In fact, the Soviet side has repeatedly encouraged the Korean people's patriotic movement. When the Korean people expressed their patriotic intentions, they advocated canceling their qualifications for negotiating to establish a provisional government. The Moscow Resolution entrusts Korea to the trusteeship of the four countries. However, the Korean people are worried whether this kind of politics is the trusteeship that Japan once implemented on Korea. This is also a normal human feeling. The United States has always been concerned about the Korean people, wanting to complete the task of establishing an independent government that the Korean people desire. I hope that the Korean people and all countries in the world understand this claim of the American representative.</p>

<h3>Seemingly a Detective Novel: Using Ultraviolet Light to Identify Bloodstains; Truth Revealed in Yu Shengxiao Case; Soil Sample from Marais's Boots Matches Blood-Stained Location; Chali to Be Remanded Tomorrow on Charges of Robbery and Murder</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the case of the Westerner Chali shooting and killing black market gold dealer Yu Shengxiao, yesterday, the police bureau adopted scientific investigation methods and collected various pieces of evidence, leaving the cunning criminal speechless. The truth of the entire case has now been revealed. The twists and turns of the process and the complexity of the case are comparable to a Sherlock Holmes detective story.</p>
<p>The success of this case is due to the meticulous investigation. For example, using ultraviolet light to detect bloodstains that had seeped into the leather seats of the car, and using chemical analysis to prove that the bloodstains left on the socks of the murderer, Marais, were of the same blood type. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the yellow soil accumulated on Marais's leather shoes was the same as the soil composition at the scene of the incident. Based on the above evidence, Chali was unable to argue any further and revealed the details of what had happened.</p>
<p>The deceased, Yu Shengxiao, a native of Ningbo, was 31 years old. He started his business by setting up a stall selling American goods in front of the Fada Western Clothing Store at 451 Sichuan Road. After accumulating some savings, he switched to trading black market gold and foreign currency, through which he met the "scalper," Englishman Chali. On the morning of August 1st, an American military officer named Marais contacted Chali to purchase five gold bars, agreeing on a price of $585 USD per bar, with delivery scheduled for 3:00 PM that afternoon. Chali, claiming to have no inventory, consulted with Yu, and they quickly reached an agreement to meet at the Fada Western Clothing Store. Yu arrived punctually at 1:00 PM but waited until after 3:00 PM without seeing Chali. Yu told people in the store that if the deal went through, he could make a profit of two million yuan. He also expressed concern that Chali's delay might mean the deal would fall through. People in the store saw him showing the five gold bars to others, with an anxious expression on his face. While they were talking, Chali suddenly arrived, circled outside the door, and whistled as a signal. Yu heard the sound and rushed out. After a brief conversation on the roadside, Yu returned to the Western Clothing Store, as Chali had rescheduled the meeting for 5:00 PM that afternoon. When the time came, Yu left the store without informing anyone and disappeared.</p>
<p>Villagers Witness the Murder</p>
<p>Around 6:00 PM, a shooting was reported in Wujiaxiang, Qinghu Highway. The victim turned out to be Yu Shengxiao. Initially, Zhu Yifang and Sun Bing, villagers residing in the Second Jia of the Seventh Bao in Wujiaxiang, were chatting while enjoying the cool air at the border of Qingpu and Shanghai. They were surprised by the sudden sound of a car speeding from the east. Just two minutes later, they saw a car speeding away in the same direction. They witnessed the driver as a robust Westerner with a small mustache. Another Westerner was in the car, seemingly wiping something. By chance, Zhu's wife passed by the scene of the incident and saw an injured person lying in a pool of blood by the roadside. She initially assumed the person had been injured by a car, but upon approaching and inquiring, the injured person said he had been shot. She rushed to tell her husband, and together they reported the incident to the Self-Defense Corps of nearby Qibao Town. When Jiang Zhigen, the leader of the First Squad, arrived to investigate, the injured person was barely breathing and only managed to say his name was Yu Shengxiao, residing at 623 Tiantong Road, and that the shooter was an Englishman named Chali. He then lost consciousness and died en route to the Red Cross Hospital.</p>
<p>Twelve Hours of Exhaustive Interrogation</p>
<p>That evening, the municipal police... Initially, they learned from Yu's wife, Yu Lu, that Chali was a "scalper" dealing in black market gold in the Central Road area but did not know his address. After inquiring with colleagues, they only knew that Chali had an Italian friend who knew his address. The police then checked the address of the friend at the Household Registration Department and, with his cooperation, apprehended Chali at the entrance of 16, Lane 186, South Shaanxi Road the next afternoon at 6:00 PM. When Chali was first arrested, he was sharp-tongued and deceitful, due to his past experience as a patrolman in the Shanghai Municipal Council, and vehemently denied the charges. However, after the police summoned people from the Fada Western Clothing Store to identify him, and on the morning of the 3rd, took Chali to the scene of the incident, where the two villagers who had witnessed the event confirmed that Chali was the driver, the police realized that the case was on the right track and began using "exhaustive interrogation" tactics, lasting twelve hours. During the repeated interrogations, Chali inadvertently revealed that the person who killed Yu Shengxiao was an American military officer named Marais, a sergeant at the Army Hospital in the Broadway Mansions. He also claimed that the car was borrowed from another friend. Upon receiving this information, the police immediately notified the Criminal Investigation Department of the U.S. Military Police Headquarters, who detained Marais. Meanwhile, officers were dispatched to Broadway Mansions, where they found a pair of pants and socks stained with blood in Marais's room. They also found a layer of yellow mud on his leather shoes, which, after comparing it with the soil at the scene of the incident, was found to be identical in composition. At this point, the U.S. military requested the police to escort Chali to the U.S. Military Police Headquarters for a face-to-face identification. Chali's Russian wife also went for questioning. The U.S. military specially selected over ten people who resembled Marais and lined them up for Chali and his wife to identify. They correctly identified Marais, providing further proof that the two were accomplices. Furthermore, Chali's wife admitted that Marais had visited their home one evening and washed his hands in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Origin of the Car</p>
<p>Chali further confessed to the police that the car they used was borrowed from his Russian friend, Pavelov, who resided at the Cathay Hotel, and the license plate number was 53922. The police then summoned Pavelov, who stated that Chali had come to his residence one afternoon at 4:00 PM, saying he was going on a long trip and wanted to borrow the car. He agreed. Chali returned at 8:00 PM, with another person in the car. They rested at the Cathay for a long time. Around 10:00 PM, Chali asked Pavelov to drive them. They first dropped off Marais at Broadway Mansions, then Chali back at South Shaanxi Road.</p>
<p>Upon receiving this information, the U.S. military police again requested the police to invite Pavelov to identify him, using the same method as before. He was immediately picked out from over ten people.</p>
<p>At the same time, the police impounded the car for detailed inspection. The brown leather seat cushion resembled bloodstains and could not be detected by the naked eye. However, using ultraviolet light, the location of the bloodstains was identified, and chemical analysis was used to compare them with the bloodstains on the socks, confirming that they were of the same blood type.</p>
<p>The Conspiracy</p>
<p>At this point, Chali could no longer deny the charges and confessed to the conspiracy with Marais, stating that he met Marais one morning and they wanted to buy five gold bars, and agreed with Yu Shengxiao to deliver the goods at 5 o'clock. Marais instructed him to borrow a car to Hongqiao Airport. At that time, Yu Shengxiao and Marais were sitting in the car. He drove to Wujiaxiang, when a gunshot was suddenly heard. Marais shouted "STOP" immediately. After applying the brakes. Marais opened the car door and kicked the injured Yu Shengxiao out of the car and onto the road. At this point, Marais ordered him to turn around and flee eastward. After driving into Shanghai city, he first went to Marais' residence for a short rest. After Marais washed his hands, they went to the Cathay Hotel together, it was eight o'clock.</p>
<p>The police investigation revealed the truth, and it was decided that Chali would be transferred to the local court tomorrow on suspicion of "robbery and murder". The officers involved in the investigation of this case, including Detective Chief, Chief Tao Rong of the Foreign Affairs Section, Section Member Xu Guoji, and officers Chen Shukan, Zhang Jinkui, and Police Officer Chen Yongzhong, spent eight days investigating and solving the case, which was reportedly praised by the authorities.</p>
<p>The car Yu Shengxiao was riding in when he was murdered was driven back to the scene to re-enact the crime. Bloodstained pants and socks and yellow soil-covered leather shoes found at Marais's residence.</p>

The case was heard for the first time in the Criminal Court No. 9 of the District Court yesterday by Judge Cao Zuwei. The witnesses summoned were Zheng Xikang, a tea server at the Zhonghua New Hotel, Yan Hongsheng, a bookkeeper at the Jincheng Guide Agency, Pan Xingrong, a tourist, Fan Jinrong, Lu Kanlin, a tea server at the Central Vegetable Society, and Qiu Chen Aizhu, the wife of the deceased. Yan pointed out in court that Sheng Shugen and Bao Yongfa had gone to Mao Qingyun's room at the Zhonghua New Hotel on June 1st. Zheng's testimony differed from his statement to the police, raising suspicions of perjury, and the court ordered him to be detained. Qiu Chen stated, "Qiu told me before he died that the people who killed him were Sheng Shugen, Feng Renyi (at large), Bao Yongfa, Chuan Qifu, Ma Caide, and over twenty others." The defendants were then questioned individually.</p>
<p>Xiang Yinquan</p>
<p>Claimed, "I am originally a rickshaw puller. On May 30th, Xiao Laili asked me to help with a fight. We gathered in Room 16 of the Zhongjun New Hotel for three days. As a result, on June 1st, I was waiting at the Atlantic Vegetable Society. Before I could go up and fight, I was shot and injured. Mao Qingyun helped me into a rickshaw to seek treatment at the Sino-American Hospital."</p>
<p>Sheng Shugen</p>
<p>Claimed, "I run a soy sauce business and received secondary education. People say I have a position among the gangsters, which is completely wrong. My family used to be well-off, but recently my business has failed, and it is difficult to maintain my family's livelihood. I have already rented out my house in the city and moved to the countryside three months ago. The identifications are all wrong."</p>
<p>Mao Qingyun</p>
<p>Claimed, "Bai Dianli asked me to open a room in the Zhonghua New Hotel for backup. Later, I found out it was for a fight. Bai told me that there were also many people on the other side, but he told me not to be afraid, saying that he had called two strongmen. We waited for Qiu for three days, and I went every day. I didn't bring a knife, only two wooden sticks and a few iron bars. On the day of the fight, I was acting as a lookout at the entrance of the Steel Pen Company. Later, I saw Xiang was injured and helped him into a rickshaw."</p>

<h3>On the Verge of Death, He Still Spoke Absurdly; Su Chengde Executed by Firing Squad; Martyr Zhang Can Finally Rest in Peace</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The traitor Su Chengde, the deputy director of the puppet Shanghai Police Bureau, was sentenced to death by the High Court on August 28 last year. Yesterday afternoon at about 12:00 PM, he was executed by firing squad in the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison, becoming the fourth person to be executed in a traitor case in this city. Zhang Xiaotong, a member of the former municipal party committee, was arrested and refused to yield, and was eventually strangled to death by Su's men. Now that Su has been brought to justice, Martyr Zhang's spirit can finally rest in peace.</p>
<p>At 11:40 AM yesterday afternoon, Yang Shouchang, the prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office, and Xu Chongwen, the warden, ascended to the first courtroom of the Special Criminal Court and ordered Su to be brought to court. Su was bald, burly, wearing a beige khaki Hong Kong shirt and shorts, white openwork short socks, and openwork light yellow leather shoes. Knowing that his death was imminent, his face was pale. However, he tried to remain calm, biting his lower lip, and sweat beads oozed from his forehead. As soon as he entered the court, he said in a sarcastic tone, "I only see darkness in front of me, please turn on the lights." At that time, the sunlight was strong and dazzling, and the prosecutor, knowing his sarcasm, ignored him. He then stated, "I am 47 years old, from Jining, Shandong, residing at 514 Haig Road, and I was the former director of the Puppet Shanghai Rural Affairs Bureau and the deputy director of the Puppet Shanghai Police Bureau," etc.</p>
<p>Unrepentant Until Death</p>
<p>The prosecutor then asked, "Did you receive the ruling from the Supreme Court rejecting the appeal?" He replied, "I received it two hours ago." The prosecutor asked, "Do you know that the court is ordered to execute you today?" He replied, "I only know because you told me." The prosecutor asked, "Do you have any last words?" He replied, "Losing my integrity and siding with the enemy was for the people in the occupied areas, and I have no regrets in my heart. What I regret is that I didn't blacken my conscience in the beginning, which has led to the current financial difficulties for my family. If I had known this, I would have blackened my heart earlier." The court, seeing that he had no last words, ordered the execution. Su requested that the handcuffs be loosened, saying, "I am a Christian and want to say a prayer before I die." He then made a "cross" on his chest and muttered words.</p>
<p>Execution by Firing Squad</p>
<p>After the prayer, he was handcuffed again. He requested to have the handcuffs removed, but it was not approved. The bailiff then escorted Su to the execution ground of the Shanghai Prison and sat him on a wooden chair with his neck placed. Bailiff Weng Yunquan used a box cannon and fired a shot at the back of his head. With a bang, the bullet entered from the left brain and exited from the nose. Su fell to the ground with the sound, bleeding profusely, his eyes open, seemingly unable to close them. At 2:00 PM, his wife, Su Xia, arrived and transported the body to the China Funeral Parlor for burial.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Davis Praises Jinan City Highly</h3>
<p>Ambassador Davis is a very humorous person. After arriving in Jinan, he first visited scenic spots such as Daming Lake and Baotu Spring. He told reporters that he had a very good impression of Jinan. He said that he never expected Jinan to have such good order, good streets, and good water under the siege of the communists, which surprised and pleased him. (Litian)</p>
<h3>Night Visit to Ambassador Stuart</h3>
<p>[Special Correspondent Litian, Jinan, 5th] U.S. Ambassador Stuart and Canadian Ambassador Davis, along with their staff and secretaries, visited Jinan on the 4th of this month. Although they only stayed in Jinan for two days, they brought the warmest friendship to every person in Jinan and left the deepest impression. In Jinan, Ambassador Stuart delivered speeches twice at banquets, once at a symposium, gave a talk to the Jinan press, gave two public lectures to all sectors of Jinan, and had a long and private conversation with our newspaper reporter in his busy schedule. In many talks, Stuart's view on China's national affairs is this:</p>
<p>A large population, a long history, and endowed with unique (heavenly) conditions and abundant products (geographical advantages) are the most favorable conditions for building a strong country, and China already possesses these many conditions. Even from a historical perspective: some ancient civilizations have mostly moved towards death, while China has a unique character and stands unscathed. At the same time, according to the world's rise and fall route, from the Near East to Western Europe to the United States and so on, China will also reach a stage of prosperity. Looking at the current world environment, the East also needs a strong country to lay the foundation for lasting peace, so from all aspects, China is hopeful.</p>
<p>The only difficulty China currently encounters is "personnel." China has no foreign troubles at present, and even if there are, they are relatively small. The problem is entirely "internal worries," that is, what is called only heavenly conditions and geographical advantages but lacking harmony among people. Today, China has begun to implement constitutional government, which is also the most important year in Chinese history. Last year the government formulated the constitution, and this year the constitution is being implemented. In this stage, young people have the best opportunity to fulfill their responsibilities as citizens. In a democratic system, people not only have rights but also responsibilities. Democracy is different from autocracy. An autocratic regime does not allow people the freedom to organize and express their opinions.</p>
<h3>Special Note on Welcoming the Ambassadors: Wang Yaowu Sits in a Jeep and Bumps All the Way to Jinan</h3>
<p>As soon as Chairman Wang Yaowu heard that the American and Canadian ambassadors had arrived in Jinan, he specially took a Jeep from the Feng'an Command Post, more than fifty kilometers away, and bumped all the way to Jinan. Ambassador Davis expressed his deep gratitude for this, saying that even if he himself were walking on the ground, it would be difficult to overcome this. (Litian from Jinan)</p>

<h3>Knowledgeable Youth Should Act as Pioneers, Leading a New Revolutionary Movement</h3>
<p>He believes that today's China is a democratic polity. He hopes that China's knowledgeable youth will become greatly aware and act as pioneers of the people, leading a new revolutionary movement. It is the responsibility of today's knowledgeable youth to give people the freedom to organize and express themselves and to exercise all the rights under a democratic political system.</p>
<p>The so-called new revolutionary movement is not the revolutionary movement of the past. The revolutionary movement of the past only talked about destruction and only talked about overthrowing. Today's revolutionary movement is a constructive revolutionary movement. China is now facing a stage of bankruptcy, so there should be a new slogan: All destruction is treason and betrayal of the country, and patriotism should be constructive. Anti-ignorance, anti-poverty, anti-corruption, anti-selfishness, anti-disturbance, anti-destruction. The new revolutionary movement should be cooperative, united, progressive, and improving.</p>
<p>Young people often express dissatisfaction with the status quo, but this does not call for pessimism, hesitation, self-interest, or selfishness. Instead, it calls for people to risk all difficulties and work hard for the country and the people. In this way, China will not be pessimistic and will not be disappointed. There is a Chinese proverb that I agree with very much: "Where there is a will, there is a way." If Chinese youth embrace this hope, I believe they will be able to make a greater and more complete contribution than before.</p>
<h3>Construction Work: Small Units, Small Plans Are Easy to Start</h3>
<p>At 10:50 PM on the 4th, Stuart and Ambassador Davis responded to a separate request from our newspaper reporter and made another individual visit. Stuart told the reporter the following valuable opinion: "The focus of China's post-war construction work is on organization, so that people can be strongly organized, and there must be an agency to express opinions so that people's opinions can be expressed, and collective opinions can be transformed into a force, and with this force, everything can be built. At the same time, civic education is also very important, so as to improve the people's patriotic sentiment. Since China's victory, there have been many construction plans, most of which are national in scope, but unfortunately, the content is too large and unrealistic, so most of them cannot be implemented. Therefore, it is far better to start from small places and improve each small group, doing it slowly step by step. Small units and small plans are easy to start, easy to carry out, and easy to achieve results, from cities and then expand to the countryside. For example, some people in Pingjin who work in civil education have been diligently cultivating for more than ten years, and have expanded from one to today's twenty-nine civil education groups, and have a hundred times more people than at the beginning."</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, when the reporter sent off the two ambassadors who were leaving Jinan and returning to Beijing, Ambassador Stuart, speaking fluent Chinese, repeatedly and solemnly urged the reporter: "Most Chinese people seem to be pessimistic and disappointed about the current national affairs, but in fact, China's suffering will surely end. Be patient, as long as everyone can organize, be patient, and do it step by step, whatever the people want, they will surely get it, and the future of the Chinese people is sure to be optimistic!"</p>

<h3>New Nursery Rhyme Appears After the Recapture of Hao County: "General with Grass Head Settles Jiangdong, China United, Fortune is Endless"</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Food Plans Partial Opening Permits Flour to be Re-exported Full Lifting of Re-export Ban Not Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the lifting of the ban on flour re-exports, the Ministry of Food recently telegraphed the Fourth District Flour Industry Association, stating that it had drafted a partial opening plan, which would be implemented after being approved by the Executive Yuan. The contents of the telegram are as follows:</p>
<p>"The Flour Industry Association of the Fourth District's Flour Presentation No. 214 of May 16th of this year, and the Jihao telegram, have been received. After this year's wheat harvest, the production of the factories under your association has increased. To ensure that the flour supply in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places is adequate, and to allow food-deficient areas such as Pingjin to be supplied, the Ministry has drafted a partial opening plan, which is being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. After approval is obtained, flour from Shanghai and other cities can be re-exported in accordance with the regulations. The request to completely lift the ban on flour re-exports from Shanghai is not approved. Regarding the application for loans from various flour factories, your association has previously submitted a request to the Ministry, which has been separately approved and recorded. Please comply accordingly."</p>
<p>The opening plan is awaiting approval at this week's Executive Yuan meeting and will be implemented immediately after its promulgation. Association representatives Rong Jingren, Xi Debing, and Sun Beiping, among others, traveled to Beijing the night before last, reportedly to inquire about the opening of re-export measures.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Flour Shipped Northward Assisting Public Educators in Pingjin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] Since National Bank of China General Manager Zhang Jia'ao returned to Shanghai from his inspection in North China, he deeply felt the urgent need for flour among public educators in Pingjin. He believed that it was necessary to purchase and export flour from this city to alleviate the situation. He authorized the China Trust Bureau to purchase flour from Shanghai flour mills. The first order was for 300,000 bags, of which 110,000 bags were shipped by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships a few days ago. The remaining 190,000 bags have been arranged with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and will be shipped within the next week. It is also learned that in order to supplement the supply, the bureau originally planned to purchase another 500,000 bags, but due to concerns about affecting the market, it was decided to temporarily purchase 250,000 bags. The transaction was agreed upon by both parties on the morning of the 9th, with the price based on the market price of the day, with a maximum of 119,000 yuan per bag. If the closing price is below 119,000 yuan, it will be settled at that price, with an estimated total amount of approximately 29.68 billion yuan. The payment method will be for the National Bank of China to transfer funds to the Agricultural Bank of China, and for the Agricultural Bank of China to deposit the funds into the accounts of flour manufacturers who have previously borrowed funds from the bank to purchase materials, in order to avoid the impact of cash flowing into the market. The delivery receipts are scheduled to be processed next Monday.</p>
<h3>Flour Loan Four Banks Approve 40 Billion</h3>
<p>The flour industry's request for a loan from the four joint banks has been approved for a total of 40 billion yuan. Except for the five Shanghai flour factories entrusted by the Ministry of Food, all can apply for loans. The scope extends to flour factories in Northeast China, North China, Central China, and Southwest China. That is, flour factories throughout the country can apply for loans, regardless of the size of the factory or the amount of production. However, they must be registered with the government and be members of the local industry association to be eligible.</p>

However, Xian rice was slightly inquired about in rural areas, with a rebound of 3,000 to 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The flour market was still sluggish at the start. At noon, rumors spread that the re-export policy was about to be implemented, boosting sentiment, and the factory flour market recovered, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Foreign flour and miscellaneous brands of flour weakened after opening in the morning, and the closing was also tight. Bran supply and demand were both scarce, and the market tended to stagnate.

<h3>Rumors of Favorable Selling Spread Hua Shares Plunge</h3>
<p>The rise in Hua shares yesterday was fleeting, and the strength suddenly turned into a sharp drop. The decline originated in the cloth market, leading to blocked shipments of cloth to the south. Hopes for Kong's trip to the United States to obtain loans were revived, and rumors of instability among trading houses spread, leading to a severe decline. Xinya and Huafeng suffered a catastrophic drop to the limit. Except for miscellaneous shares, almost all closed at low prices.</p>
<p>After opening in the morning with a large difference in the pre-market National Bank of China exchange, it fell to 209 yuan and 211 yuan, and then Yongsha opened. Numbers 223, 231, 76, 8, 32, and 218 advanced to 234 yuan, and numbers 103 and 235 were slightly sold, but then fell to 230 yuan. Number 122 still came to advance without stopping, and bought a lot of Meiya. Numbers 35, 73, and 213 advanced again to 236 yuan.</p>
<p>At 10:10, numbers 186 and 85 came to sell, and it began to fall slightly. After 10:45, when news of a cloth price decline spread, sentiment weakened. Xinya first fell to the limit from number 174, and Huafeng also traded at the limit from number 4. Numbers 36, 76, 94, 163, 160, 223, and 153 frantically sold, and number 163 even tried to sell Yongsha in cash. At 11:21.</p>
<p>At 11:30, numbers 186, 218, and 103 advanced to about 215 yuan, and numbers 85, 36, 65, 112, 160, and 97 sold again. Near noon, cash Yongsha fell to a low price of 204 yuan, and forward Yongsha fell to a low price of 209 yuan. Numbers 186, 215, 163, and 172 had some support, and the noon close was relatively stable, with forward Yongsha closing at 210 yuan.</p>

<h3>Negotiated Price of 20-Count Cotton Yarn Changed to 9.5 Million Yuan Cotton Yarn Cloth Sales Are Strong, Heading Downstream</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Textile Adjustment Committee convened a price negotiation group meeting at 4 PM yesterday. As a result of the evaluation, it was decided to list the negotiated price of 20-count yarn at 9.5 million yuan next Monday, which is 100,000 yuan lower than the previous negotiated price. The negotiated prices of other yarn counts remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Due to the joint sales of state-owned and private yarn mills last month, there were many quotas, and the actual demand from customers and weaving factories was still weak. There were more sellers on the market, and the market was unable to rise. The market was heading downstream. As a result, 42-count Lanfeng yarn fell close to the 16 million yuan mark, to 16.1 million yuan, continuing to fall by 350,000 yuan compared to yesterday. 20-count special Shuangma also fell by 250,000 yuan to 11.5 million yuan. Light Shuangma fell by 200,000 yuan to 10 million yuan. 16-count Guangming fell below the 9 million yuan mark, to 8.8 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 100,000 to 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The cloth market was weak due to merchants in North China, floods in South China, sluggish sales in Hankou, and no intention to absorb goods. It was also rumored that the cloth market in Japan was only half the price of Shanghai, and that smuggled woolen cloth might come to Shanghai. Therefore, industry insiders were all competing to sell, and the market was heading downstream. As a result, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell to 411,000 yuan, a drop of 9,000 yuan compared to last month. Wufu, Lanjikai, Caiqiu, Yanghe, and other fine cloths also fell by 5,000 to 9,000 yuan. Other bleached cloth, coarse cloth, Serge, and blue cloth, Shilin cloth, etc., all fell, ranging from 2,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, but there were few applicants, with a total of only 28 households, purchasing 1,940 bolts of cloth. Among them, one manufacturer purchased 60 bolts of cloth, and 28 cloth stores purchased 1,340 bolts of cloth.</p>

The various yarn mills and importers actively applied, and with the August 15th deadline approaching, the bureau specially invited all relevant agencies to hold a second review meeting at 10 AM yesterday, chaired by Zhang Xu, Director of the Bureau. After detailed discussion of the implementation rules for purchasing, processing, and exporting, supplements were made to the previous resolutions. More than 25,000 bales of foreign cotton (the total number is only 40,000 bales) were approved for purchase.

<h3>Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation Running Single-Handedly Urgently Needs Funds Robbed by Bandits, All Belongings Lost Double Misfortunes Never Come Singly</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I used to work in the education field. In 1943, I could not make a living due to the enemy occupation. I had no choice but to borrow money to run a single-handed business with a friend. Because I was a layman, I suffered huge losses, so I mortgaged my ancestral property (the registration certificate is in my name), 14 mu of low-lying paddy fields and 8 mu of high-lying paddy fields, for 40,000 yuan in counterfeit banknotes. At that time, the other party was afraid that the currency system would change, and refused to specify the amount of money. I, in my haste and carelessness, signed a promissory note for 80 dan of rice (at that time, the price of rice was 500 yuan per dan in counterfeit banknotes), and used 3.6 dou of rent grain for each crop season of the 8 mu of high-lying paddy fields, and 14 shi of rice per year for the low-lying paddy fields, to offset the interest on the loan. I knew that the contract was obviously unfair at the time, but I hoped that if I could make a small profit the following year, I could prepare the money to redeem the fields. Unexpectedly, in the autumn of the following year, I was robbed while transporting goods to Taixian, Subei, and lost everything. The hope of redemption was gone, so I planned to sell the fields to the creditors. They took the opportunity to devalue the fields again, and if I sold them to someone else, the creditors would not budge on the principal (i.e., 80 shi of rice). I am really unwilling, and plan to file a lawsuit, but I do not know the legal procedures. Please advise. Reader Cao Yiping.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan's Answer] During the occupied period, voluntarily mortgaging farmland to others, the contract is of course legally valid, and cannot be overturned on the grounds that it was obviously unfair at the time. For now, the only option is to request redemption in accordance with the law, and to fulfill the contents of the contract until you are willing to sell it to the creditor or a third party, subject to the autonomy of the party concerned.</p>

<h3>South China Smuggling</h3>
<p>— Sea Breeze</p>
<p>You must admit that smugglers are "omnipresent." As long as a "black market" exists, "smuggling" cannot be eliminated. During the war, gold smuggling was rampant. At that time, gold in the Southeast was much cheaper than in Chongqing, and cases of smuggling gold by air became commonplace.</p>
<p>Now, the smugglers in Hong Kong and Shanghai are even more resourceful. No matter what kind of blockade line it is, they can open it with "gold bricks" and "legal tender." Can you say that there is no smuggling in Hong Kong and Shanghai? Wholesale, large-scale, and small-scale, there are people specializing in this industry.</p>
<p>The 150 million legal tender's worth of smuggling from Hong Kong and Shanghai reported in this newspaper is just one example of smuggling that was accidentally discovered.</p>
<p>You must admit that "Hong Kong," the "tiny piece of land" that should be returned to China, has become a base for "smuggling" in South China. According to the open declaration of the Hong Kong Customs Superintendent:</p>
<p>"This year, we have seized 500 smuggling cases. We believe that this large-scale smuggling must have a strong and powerful organization behind it. Hong Kong does not want to become a smuggling base, which would hinder China's economy."</p>
<p>According to two recent smuggling cases, there are the Xinjiang Wheel smuggling case and the Foshan Wheel smuggling case; the latter is particularly large-scale and is a very organized action. Hong Kong and Guangdong are very close, but due to import controls, Hong Kong goods are smuggled into Guangzhou in large quantities.</p>
<p>"The only way to cure smuggling is to stabilize prices and currency values. If currency values and prices are unstable, "South China smuggling" will not be eliminated for a while.</p>
<p>"Hong Kong" - the basic reason why it has become a "darling" on the smuggling "honey seat" is precisely this.</p>
<p>For example, a large amount of Philippine funds are being smuggled into Macau. This is related to the fluctuation of China's legal tender.</p>
<p>A United Press report from Manila on the 2nd clearly pointed this out, saying:</p>
<p>"The amount of gold exports to China has increased dramatically since the value of Chinese currency began to fluctuate in February of this year, which has attracted the attention of the Philippine government."</p>
<p>How to stop the so-called "South China smuggling" that is rampant in Hong Kong, Macau, Shanghai, and Guangdong? If we only use passive methods to stop it, it may be difficult to achieve results in a short period of time.</p>

<h3>We Can Really—Fly with Wings</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ming Sen</p>
<p>Tie yourself into the seat of the latest small helicopter, the "Hoppicopter," start the rotor above your head, grab the "joystick," and you can take off from your yard for a two-hundred-mile flight!</p>
<p>The "Hoppicopter" can be said to be a miniature helicopter, small, safe, and easy to operate, and seems to have all the conditions to become a tool for ordinary men and women to fly alone at will. It weighs only one hundred and twenty-five pounds, and each one costs about seven hundred and fifty dollars (US dollars) - if produced in large quantities, the price can probably be reduced somewhat. Horace Pentecost, chairman of the "Hoppicopter Company" in Yatu, said, "The function and comfort of this small helicopter can be compared to a good kick bike."</p>
<p>Mr. Pentecost has written a booklet called "The Economics of the Solo Helicopter," which explains that this aircraft is actually easier to use than most other travel tools. Turn yourself into the seat - with three lifting wheels under the seat - the engine is behind your shoulders, and the rotor is above your head. All you need to take care of is a "joystick," the handle of which is right in front of you.</p>
<p>This joystick is a tube-like strong rough sample, about two and a half feet long. It can be pushed up and down, forward or backward, and it can be turned. This way, you can descend or ascend, move forward or backward, or hover in the air - without having to take care of a large number of driving mechanisms at the same time.</p>
<p>The "Hoppicopter" is not a toy. It can rise to a height of about 12,000 feet and has a speed of 90 miles per hour. Under normal circumstances, if the load does not exceed two hundred and fifty catties, it can continue to fly for two hundred miles.</p>
<p>Most importantly, this aircraft is safe. If the engine of a "Hoppicopter" malfunctions, it can hover quietly and land safely.</p>
<p>Of all the flying tools, only the "Hoppicopter" may be economically comparable to other modes of transportation. Its selling price is only slightly higher than a top-of-the-line new machine road car. Seven "pints" of fuel can fill its fuel tank, and it does not require a special field for it to land or take off. You can use your own backyard or a nearby open space.</p>
<p>You don't need a hangar to store your "Hoppicopter," because your existing garage can be used. Moreover, according to one of the creators and west of the aircraft, the shipping cost of this aircraft will not be very large, because it is very easy to disassemble it and pack it into several boxes of convenient sizes.</p>
<p>The cost of using and maintaining it is so low that it cannot be compared with existing aircraft, so it can be afforded by ordinary middle-class families.</p>
<p>As soon as the news about the "Hoppicopter" came out, millions of people from all over the world wrote to inquire about its evaluation. "Everyone seems to be in particular need of safe, cheap and independently controlled flights," Pentecost said in his booklet "The Economics of the Solo Helicopter": "Missionaries in the interior of Africa see in this aircraft a tool that saves them from spending weeks cutting a path only a few sips long in the primeval jungle. Explorers in South America see it as a key that can open up all insurmountable or impassable mountains, dense forests, and swamps. Large-scale pastoralists see it as a substitute for "old horses" to patrol their vast pastures. Prospectors want to use it to find "the vein that was almost found last time," but most people, including myself, just want it as a simple and cheap means of transportation, to take us to a place one or two hundred miles away whenever we are happy!"</p>

<p>The Smallest Relief</p>
<p>Guotai Township, Xiyu, Huaxian County, Guangdong, urgently needs relief after this flood. The area recently received a batch of relief supplies, with each household receiving a wine glass of flour and each person receiving a spoonful of diluted milk.</p>
<p>The relief supplies were handed over to the Commissioner's Office by the Relief Administration, then to the County Government by the Commissioner's Office, then to the Township Office by the County Government, then to the Bao Office by the Township Office, then to the Jia Office by the Bao Office, and then distributed to the villagers by Yongchang.</p>
<p>Family Reunion in Prison</p>
<p>Wang Zhenyang, a farmer from Guangxi, lost contact with his wife and daughter during the retreat of the national army in Guangxi during the war. He searched everywhere but could not find them and wandered to Qian, where he became a vagrant. At the end of last month, in Zhenfeng County, he was so poor that he stole a book from a shop, was arrested by the shop owner, and was sent to the county government for interrogation, where he was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Unexpectedly, after Wang was imprisoned, he suddenly found his wife and daughter, who had been separated for three years, also in prison. Surprise, joy, hatred, and sorrow all surged into his heart. It turned out that his wife and daughter were addicted to opium and wandered around after being separated. They came to the county a month ago and were arrested by the police in an opium den. They did not expect to celebrate a family reunion in prison!</p>
<p>Missing the Point</p>
<p>A civics teacher at a girls' school in Shenyang, who is the younger brother of the principal and quite fat, gave the following three questions for the civics exam this semester: (1) What is the relationship between democracy and making the best use of people's talents and making the best use of land? (2) Why can dictatorship cause peasant revolutions? (3) What is the impact of international affairs on civil wars? The students scratched their heads and handed in blank papers. After the exam, some students went home and asked their fathers and brothers, who all said it was nonsense.</p>

<h3>Prohibition of Night Tours</h3>
<p>(Recorded on July 13, Guangxu 22nd Year)</p>
<p>West of the New World, along Jing'an Temple Road, fifty years ago, there were mostly foreign merchants' residences. In the depths of summer, carriages would travel to the Jing'an Temple area for evening breezes, the sound of hooves ceaseless, disturbing people's dreams. The consul then convened with the Shanghai County Magistrate to issue an announcement:</p>
<p>"Regarding the investigation and announcement of matters: It is noted that the Jing'an Temple area has tea houses and gardens, where people can rest. The number of vehicles and horses coming and going is increasing day by day, night after night, with constant clamor, disturbing the ears. Not only can the nearby residents not rest, but also local hooligans and bandits take advantage of this to seize things and cause trouble, which is a concern for the local area. Every summer, tourists seek coolness, only seeking temporary comfort, but the deep night wind and dew peel the skin and invade the muscles, those who suffer from it deeply and those who develop it quickly. The increase in summer and autumn epidemics is not due to this. It must be known that working during the day and resting at night is an ancient precept, how can we forget the harm in greed for pleasure and be unrestricted. The former prefect and the county magistrate have already issued an announcement, and now that summer is approaching, we will conduct another investigation and announcement for this purpose: Let the tea houses and tourists in the Jing'an Temple area know. After this announcement, the night tea market will be limited to 11 o'clock, and all activities will be stopped. All gardeners must prevent people from entering the garden at 11 o'clock every night, and those tourists who have already arrived at the garden must be urged to leave the garden. No delay is allowed, and if anyone dares to violate this, the matter will be reported and investigated, and no leniency will be given. In addition to ordering the dispatch of police officers and cooperative security guards to investigate and prohibit, this county magistrate and prefect will take measures to maintain local peace and order. Therefore, everyone must comply and not violate this, and this special announcement is made."</p>
<p>The Shanghai night market has a long history, and is even more so today. The roaring sound of cars continues all night, which is even more disturbing than the sound of carriages in the past. This is because there are more versions every day, and cold drinks are sold at night, often using radio as a means of promotion, often lasting until dawn. Recently, the North-China Daily News wrote an editorial, expressing dissatisfaction with the city's noisy habits. If you read it in conjunction with the above text, you can know that this trend did not start today. (Compiled by the newspaper's data room)</p>
<h3>A Week in the Film World</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>A New Type of Detective Film "Remember the Old Days"</p>
<p>When those cliché detective films no longer arouse the interest of the audience, the screenwriters of Hollywood are exploring other avenues. This "Remember the Old Days" takes a relatively fresh form. Naturally, this so-called freshness is just that no detectives or hounds are used to solve the case. The whole play uses a detective novelist who inadvertently hears about a bizarre assassination case, and the deceased happens to be a famous thief, which arouses his curiosity. He tries to trace the life of the thief, so he encounters many twists and turns and difficulties. Also, due to the novelist's search for materials everywhere, the whole story is connected. The original intention of the screenwriter in using this form to compile the script is to focus on the description of criminal psychology, but in "Remember the Old Days", this point is written very superficially, and in fact, the more important social causes of crime are completely ignored in the script.</p>
<p>The director's handling of this is indeed superior to the writing of the play, and he cleverly and humorously uses a strong human touch, especially the scenes of the naval officer being deceived into entering the gambling field for the first time and selling the map, which are the most brilliant parts of the play.</p>
<p>Peter Lawler's novelist is humorous and humorous, and his performance is just right. The male protagonist Chai Kare Shi Xie Tuo of "The Murderer" plays very cleanly. Shani Green Li's Beid is stable and more than enough, but has no special achievements.</p>
<p>Technically, this film can be considered above the level.</p>
<p>Vaudeville Dance Film "Peach and Plum Fragrance"</p>
<p>"Peach and Plum Fragrance" is a vaudeville-style dance film. What the whole film wants to express is this pair of comical dance stars, Joan Davis and Jack Haley, plus American drum king Chin Crowber and electric organ female musician Wu Yisou'er Smith. Therefore, the story in the script does not occupy an important position, and the love story between Jill and Tom is only a foil, and even a bit out of place in some places. Naturally, it is difficult to demand that the story of such a miscellaneous dance film be complete and rationalized.</p>
<p>But even if we take a step back, this "Peach and Plum Fragrance" can only belong to a third-rate dance film. The director's handling of the play fails to grasp the overall development, especially dividing it into parts.</p>
<p>As entertainment, you can only find the value in the gimmicks of the pair of comical stars Joan Davis and Feike Haley.</p>
<p>Goebbels' Love Story "Women's Enemy"</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a failed work. Regardless of the screenwriter, director, or even the actors, the whole play is bland and dull, and it is simply impossible to find any highlights.</p>
<p>The script uses Goebbels' deeds to form this story, trying to expose the tragic life of the German people under the Nazi system. But from the film's point of view, it is also extremely weak. Especially for a character like Goebbels, the fleeting description gives the audience a blurred impression instead.</p>
<p>In the performance, Paul Ando's Goebbels is a failure. Whether in modeling or characterization, he has not grasped this character. Claudia Helank's Mary is only slightly better in one or two places, and Donald Hughes' Hans is still stable.</p>
<p>The director should bear the greatest responsibility for the failure of this play.</p>
