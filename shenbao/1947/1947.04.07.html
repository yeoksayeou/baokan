<h3>徐箴談東北近狀　遼省除旅順外已全接收　國軍實力甚雄厚不處共軍進襲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕遼寗主席徐　氏，於三月廿一日自瀋抵京，出席三中全會，會後於四日來滬。記者昨夜特往訪晤，並叩詢東北近况，據云：遼寗因接收較早，今日治安已無問題，全省除旅順一市外，已全部收復。</p>
<p>遼省有報紙二十餘家，銷數較多者有中央·和平·前進·東北前鋒·東北民報·商業日報·中蘇日報·新報·瀋陽日報·正義報等·日銷均在一萬份以上，此外，通訊社亦甚多。</p>
<p>東北之收復區，的佔全境五分之二强，各重要之政治·經濟·文化中心，均在收復區內，人口佔東北總人口三分之二以上，交通已告恢復，惟感車皮不够。日俘之這送，在六十萬人以上，日本在東北已無地下力量存在。　東北目前所感受之困難，仍在財政方面，此則全國皆然，並非東北一地之特殊情形。以物資之供應而言，土產之日用品不感缺乏外埠輸入者在運輸上有困難，惟因營；葫蘆島港口之使用，較之一年之前，已屬便利多多。東北目前之貨幣仍以流通券爲主，物價較之初接收時，約漲十倍左右。</p>
<p>東北工業設備被人搬光者在十分之七左右，剩餘之設備正積極加以利用，惟因日貨機器之不易補充，以及技術人員之缺乏，此項工作尚未完成。現東北之重工業槪由資委會經營，其他之輕工業則由行轅之東北生產管理局主管。</p>
<p>國軍在東北之實力甚爲雄厚，不處共軍之進襲，遼寗省內已組織民衆自衛隊，担任保護鐵路及保護晨村之工作。</p>
<p>關於旅大之接收，徐氏拒不表示意見，但認爲以政治方法接收需時較長，以軍事接收費時較少。共軍在大述者爲數不多，不致發生大規模之戰役。徐氏並謂：在京時曾晋謁主席，就各方面有所請示。徐主席因交通工具關係，一兩日不致　　。</p>

<h3>實施憲政人民要有守法精神　彭部長昨應本報之請在滬廣播演說</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕宣傳部部長彭學沛，應本報之請，於昨日下午六時在中華自由廣播電台播講主旨爲「實施憲政人民要有守法精神」，茲誌彭部長演詞大意如下：「今年是憲政實施開始年，國民黨即將結束訓政，實行還政於民。但人民開始參加政治，第一，應有接受憲政的準備，第二，要有行使政權的訓練和經騐，第三，要有奉公守法的精神。譬如說，我們要求自由，就不要妨害別人的自由，人人要守法和自制，方能大公而無私，促成團結和統一，否則，四萬萬人個個濫用自由，豈不糟糕？人人要明瞭守法自制的意義，詳細些說，就是在政府中的人當然應守法，不要濫用職權，但老百姓也要守法，不能够隨便胡作胡爲，不負責任。例如辦報的人，不能因爲要滿足私人的慾望，隨意違反了民族國家的利益或違反人民的權益而發言。這就是說，大家不要但圖一己的利益，一定要以全體的利益爲利益。我們看一看別的國家，就可以得到證明。爲什麽英美的憲政成功？原因就是他們上自政府，下至人民，都有奉公守法制法的精神。他們的報業發達，但報土很少不負責的言論，都是根據事實說話，不是個人的意氣。因為他們的報人，自已能够管制自已，所以政府不用管制它。這稱高度的守法自治的精神，是英美憲政成功的唯一的條件。再看爲什麼德日會失敗？這是因爲德日的一般人民，沒有民主政治的訓練，沒有守法的習慣，以致放任了少數人的好大喜功，馴至產生荒謬的侵略思想，人民更跟着盲從，最後便造成今日慘敗的局面。德日之强，無論在政治上或經濟上都不能否認。但曾幾何時，竟一敗塗地，就因爲人民不够守法的結果。英美憲政的成功能，德日之所以失敗，原因就在於冊守法與不能守法，須知實施憲政，絕非輕而易舉的事情，必須要全體人民都有智識行憲才能成功。不然，很可能使我們得到相反的結果。古人云：天下興亡，匹夫有責，就是說人人對於國家政治都有責任，有了責任方有權利。今日所貢獻於各位的，就是「天下興亡，匹夫有責」八個字。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>美國對於世界和平的責任</h3>
<p>杜魯門總統於美國故總統哲佛遜誕辰紀念日，向民主黨大會發表演說，重言聲明：美國對於締造世界和平，責無旁貸，故對於各國人民之自由遭受危險者，均應負有援助之責。又謂「爲負起此項責任起見，美國必須保有充分之軍事力量，俾使世界各國相信，美國決意依照其責任行事；美國不僅强大而已，且須有一健全之經濟金融情形。」在這一篇重要的演辭內，雖未直接言及援助希士兩國的計劃，但是他所闡明的外交政第，正是對其援助希土計劃的一種有力的詮釋，使美國人民聽了，都深深地感覺到美國對於世界和平所負的責任，實在太重要了；若要達成這個光榮而崇高的使命，則非充分發揮其政治智慧不可</p>
<p>杜魯門總統於上月十二日向參衆兩院聯席會議發表演說，要求國會撥款四萬萬美元援助希臘土耳其兩國，並以其他方式協助希土兩國復興，藉以抵抗外來壓力；迄今將近四星期，美國輿論界對於杜魯門總統的援助希土計劃，意見雖極龐雜，但是綜合起來，也有一個共同之點，這就是大家一致認爲，此　援助希土兩國，確有其必要，所以參議院外交委員會於本月三日討論這個計劃時，就一致將總統所提援助希土計劃予以通過，同時又將該會主席范登堡的修正案予以通過，聞國務院對於這個修正案，也已表示同意，故參議院於明日開會時，就要開始討論這個援助希土的計劃了。</p>
<p>美國積極援助希士兩國，不僅是美國外交政策更加明朗的表示，而且也是美蘇關係益趨微妙的先聲。所以在杜魯門總統發表了這個計劃之後，幾乎使全世界都震動了，對於莫斯科的影響允爲重大，甚至超過正在莫斯科舉行的四國外長會議，就是在言論最自由的美國議員，起初對於這個足以左右世界政局的計劃，也不得不採取謹愼態度，不敢任意加以評論，但是三四個星期以來，美國輿論界已澄淸了，完全明瞭目下的世界局勢，深感美國對於希土兩國有予以援助的必要，大家都相信，這個計劃，不僅不致引起新的戰爭，而且足以鞏固世界和平的基礎。所成問題的，僅在政治智慧的如何運用！</p>
<p>在法理上講，杜魯門總統所提出的援助希土兩國計劃。是依照聯合國憲章而擬就的，在其序文中也明明規定，如果聯合國機構力能援助希土兩國，則美國卽須停止實施其援助希土計劃；同時參議院外交委員會主席范登堡所提出的修正案，也已經外交委員會通過了，國務院對此並不異議，這個修正案並明白的規定，遇到下列三種塲合時，美國卽須停止實施援助希土的計劃：（一）聯合國機構若經聯合國大會或安全理事會通過決議而力能自行實施援助希土兩國之計劃時；（二）希土兩國大多數人民要求美國停止援助時；（三）美國總統若認為此項援助希土計劃之基本目標無法實現時。從此可知，美國援助希土計劃，並不是一成不變非貫徹不可的。我們再看美國國務院所發表答覆各國參議員話問的文件，其中也有兩點，最値得我們注意：（一）美國並不欲以援助希土兩國為手段而成為土耳其海峽的共同看守者：（二）美國援助希士的計劃，不能視爲美國欲包圍蘇聯或其他各國之企圖。</p>
<p>但是從另一方面看來，却又大謬不然：蘇聯對於土耳其，不僅懷有領土要求，而且久欲染指土耳其的海峽，這是盡人皆知的事實；土耳其受外力的壓迫，惶惶然不可終日，也是衆所週知的事實，杜魯門總統所謂美國將援助土耳其以抵抗其外來的壓力，究指何國而言？更是不喻可知。以言希臘局勢，希臘是巴爾幹國家之一，蘇聯豈顧其置身圈外！從大戰結束迄今，無時不在內戰烽火的燃燒之中，雖有英國的駐軍，協助希臘政府維持秩序與安全；但是武裝游擊隊的紛擾不已，始終無法肅清，希臘北部已另成一個世界；希臘的內戰，有無國際背景？也已是不言可知的了！英蘇兩國的外交家在迭次國際會議中，為了希臘問題，不知發生過多少决的舌戰，蘇聯處處以英軍駐在希臘攻擊英國干涉他國內政，其用意究底在那裏？蘇聯對於巴爾幹半島早已視為其安全地帶，獨有希臘一國不在其「鐵幕」的背後，蘇聯怎能袖手旁觀？現在英國感到自顧不暇，不得不從希臘退出來了，但在英國退出希臘之後，美國若不將英國在希臘的地位，取而代之，則追踪而入的，自然是蘇聯的勢力了。所以杜魯門總統的援助希土計劃，不論美國如何解釋，但在蘇聯應之，終覺得不啻芒刺之在背！這也是必然的道理。</p>
<p>我們站在第三者的立塲，平心靜氣，觀察國際局勢的發展，深知美蘇兩國的對立，已有日益尖銳化的趨勢！為世界和平的前途計，的確値得我們憂慮的。戰後美蘇兩國，受了這次血的敎訓，雖然都感覺到戰爭的可怕，和平的可愛：但是因爲思想的不同，實際利益的衝突，竟造成兩國對立的形勢。我們研究其癥結所在，顯係由於兩國的互相猜忌而不能互信互諒所致。在蘇聯言，終覺得美國憑其原子能的秘密及其金元外交的優勢，處處在威脅蘇聯，防制蘇聯，使蘇聯不得不擴充其「安全圈」，以謀其自保之道。此在美國，終覺得蘇聯在擴張其勢力，不論在歐洲或在遠東，有如水銀瀉地，無孔不入，因此爲防患於未然計，不得不保守原子能的秘密，不得不維持在世界各處的軍事基地，更不得不以巨款貸與感受外力壓迫的國家，助其發展，俾能予以堅決抵抗。雙方的疑忌，互為因果，互相刺激也就積不相容的冰炭了。甚至對於任何一件事情，美蘇的看法，終是各不相同，例如對於和平的看法，不是蘇聯所領導的和平，蘇聯終覺得這不是眞正的和平；同樣在美國，不是美國保護之下的和平，也就不是眞正的和平。再如蘇聯式的民主？和美國式的民主，更有天壤之別。所以美蘇雖然同樣要謀得和平民主的實現，但是雙方所懹有的理想及其所應採取的方法，完全是背道而馳的。今日仍在莫斯科舉行的外長會議，儘管四强對於德國問題，在原則上完全一致，但是一觸及核心，就意見紛岐了。這是一個絕好的證明。</p>
<p>要之，我們對於杜魯門總統所謂美國對於締造世界和平負有責任一節，完全同意；但是究應採取何種方式，始能完成其對於世界全人類所負的使命；尤其是對於蘇聯，美國究應運用何種政治智慧而能將美蘇間的疑忌消滅於無形，似尚有考慮的必要。</p>

<h3>防範侵略維護各國自由　美決採取積極立場　杜魯門發表演說重申信念　欲求避免戰爭務須杜絕衝突根源</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕杜魯門總統今日在民主黨創辦人傑弗遜總統紀念日宴會中發表演說，力言美國務須採取積極的立場，對付各種形式的侵略，並須保持本身之經濟力量。美國人對於一般人民凡其自由遭外國勢力威脅者，務須加以援助。總統特別指出秘密潛入與公開的武力侵略兩種方式。內政方面，總統稱，共和黨在國會之要求立即减稅等經濟措施，將招致災患。渠對於下屆選舉並無計劃。總統提及「為支持聯合國起見，吾人於必要時應補充其活動」一節時，顯然指其援助希臘與土耳其之方案而言。據稱：「援助自由國家維護自由，則吾人可在完成聯合國機構之作用中增強該機構之力量。吾人務須採取一種積極的立場，徒言不欲戰爭，未足濟事。此際務須杜絕任何衝突之開端，以防其威脅擴大至全世界。吾人以前嘗見強國利用武力，侵略弱國，用流血解決。吾人已知其結果。美國職責所在，應為聯合國機構保衛。聯合國機構務須撲滅任何地點之火燄，不惜利用國際警衛軍以防止武力衝突。」總統復稱，時局之演變，使美國有領導世界之必要，不顧任務之艱險與代價之巨大。供獻華盛頓，傑弗遜，林肯與羅斯　等人物於世界者，吾國人民是也。不僅珍惜自由，且於必要時願以生命相護衛者，吾國人民是也。吾人亦且承認其他國家與人民共享此種自由之權利。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕美國參議院方面對於杜魯門總統援助希土方案之指責，分為兩派，一派決定反對到底，另一派準備在別無他途時加以接受。反對派各議員稱，彼等將在本星期參議院會議席上奮鬥，努力打消對土耳其之援助，對希臘之援助，亦僅以救濟性貿者為限。同時國務院亦發表四十六頁之印就的文件，答復國會議員提出之問題一百十一個，足為擁護援助計劃者助陣。答案中力言援助希土，對於蘇聯之合法利益，並無任何直接威脅。蘇聯不能解釋此種援助為不友好行為，以之作為報復之藉口。希臘安定所受之最大威脅，乃一萬三千游擊隊推翻現政府之企圖。此輩游擊隊大部份雖非共產黨，但其領袖大率均為共產黨，宣傳共產思想，故須加以防止。至於土耳其，該國在戰時為盟國方面有利的中立國。土耳其曾在多方面援助盟國，例如准許盟國技師入境，准許盟國在其境內設立軍火供應庫及便利盟國傷兵及俘虜之通過等，故亦值得加以援助。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕陸軍部官員今日宣稱：美國陸軍已擬有部署陸空軍隊從事第一期防禦戰之計劃。海軍軍令部長尼米茲亦曾向參院軍事委員會宣布，聯合參謀部已擬就防禦計劃，並經陸海兩部長通過。據陸軍部長柏德遜左右稱：我人可以安全假定，此項計劃常在修正，且係根據可以合理推斷之計多數敵人，作多種可能方式之攻擊而決定。此項計劃僅在運用被攻擊時可能獲得之兵員·槍砲·船隻及飛機，目前必須參謀部全體人員同意，始　進行。</p>
<p>參謀長官團為陸海空軍參謀長及總統軍事顧問合組而成，至於聯合參謀部之櫂力，今日殆無人知之。軍界人員對於計劃方面雖不願討論，惟在近數月中曾力言此部及太平洋防禦之重要，陸軍地上部隊曾在北方作廣大之實騐，海陸空軍亦然。遠東太平洋防禦切實遠大之計劃，自美國與菲律濱政府對美國陸海軍在菲基地問題成立協議後，業已形成。本星期內聯合國安理會又通過美國託管前日本委任統治各島，菲律濱與夏威夷間太平洋區之防禦，在計劃上　可益增便利。</p>

<h3>安全理事會　今有重要會議</h3>

<h3>杜魯門演說　備受歡迎</h3>

<h3>德中央行政機構　應由盟管會管制　四國外長已商獲協議</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科五日電〕四國外長會議本日繼續討論德國政治組織問題，一致決定將德國中央行政機構，置於盟管會管制之下，然後再逐步設立德國諮詢委會及德臨時政府。法國計劃中提議在德國中央行政機構之外，另行設立德國行政委會，由盟國控制之，僅為英美代表團所同意，至於蘇聯則保留其決定。又法國另一建議，主張薩爾區不應歸德國中央行政機構管轄，魯爾區及萊茵區在法理上之地位應容後解決，俾最後限制德中央行政機構對於此等地區之管轄權。蘇聯對於法國此項建議，亦採取保留態度，至於英美則對於法國之兩項建議均表示接受，但有一條件，即此二項建議，均憊在協定中加以規定。四外長本日討論德政治組織問題，係遵照調整委會所提報告書之原則，當論及各佔領區司令對於德中央行政機構之權力與責任一項問題時，意見頗為紛歧，最後乃決定將此一問題，交回調整委會再行審議。四外長繼即討論設立德諮詢委會問題，對於該會之成立日期頗多誤解，最後一致通過英外相貝文之建議，規定德諮詢委會應在組織德中央行政機講後之三個月內成立之，至於德臨時政府則將在諮詢委會產生後九個月內組織之。當四外長討論德國諮詢委會之構成時，意見相左又極顯著。洪代表提出一項建議，主張諮詢委會應由各邦代表三名參加，由各邦政府或議會依照民主輿論在命之，此在蘇代表則提議諮詢委會應包括政黨·工會·及其他民主組織之代表，英美代表國稱，彼等對於任何仿案，凡不使德諮詢委會之代表踰越工會及政黨之範圍者，均願予以接受，但英美兩國最後仍決定為法國建議之後盾，此在蘇外長莫洛托夫則力言及納粹·民主組織·有參與諮詢委會工作之必要，結果四外長對於諮詢委會之組成問題，並未成立協議，決定將此一問題交回調整委會再加以討論。</p>

<h3>英政府徵兵法修正案　邱吉爾表示反對　保守黨對政府態度將重予考慮</h3>
<p>〔法國新開社倫敦五日電〕英國前任首相邱吉爾本日在加德威爾發表聲明稱：政府當局於上星期日向下議院提出對於徵兵法之修正案，將兵役期限自十八個月減少至一年，保守黨對終此項修正將投票加以反對。保守黨及自由黨前曾投票贊成政府，其故厥因彼等聞及各部大臣發表公開聲明之後，已感覺獲得保證，吾人有一切理由可相信政府向議會所提出之計劃，係各部大臣經長時期縝密研究之結果，且係以軍事專家之建議為根據者。吾人並相信政府之建議，代表英國在今後數年內應付需要並履行義務之最少限度國防處置。但就目下情形而論，此一計劃並無任何根據，與國防需要並無任何關係，提出此項計劃之各部大臣，亦並無任何信心。此項計劃，暴露工黨內閣，處理一切影響國民生計之事宜，不問其大小，亦不問其在國內或國外，均屬荏弱無能。余於上星期日曾在下議院宣稱：保守黨匪特擬在該案二讀時為政府之後盾，抑且在該案之所有階段均擬支持政府，但目前吾人必須顧及國家科益重新考慮吾人之立場與行動方針云。此外工黨極端左派領袖齊里亞克斯本日單獨接見法國新聞社記者，代表「工黨叛黨議員」發表談話稱：邱吉爾暨其友人若在徵兵法三讀時投反對票，則吾人決不投反對票，吾黨之若干溫和份子或將投票反對此項法案，但余本人則將棄權。余意余之友人亦將棄權。余及余之友人為欲改變政府之外交政策，故採取反對政府此項草案之立場，但決不願予保守黨以任何機會云。</p>

<h3>挪威在積極復興中　竭力擺脫蘇聯控制</h3>
<p>— 本報編詳室特譯</p>
<p>挪威現正向着復興途中猛進，準備在明年年底完全恢復戰前狀態，相信惟有這樣才能擺脫蘇聯的經濟控制。挪威政府在一九四七年初準備批准以兩年為期的挪蘇商約。挪威願意和蘇聯通商，但不願受任何國家過於嚴格或過於長時期的牽制。同時在當前局面下，蘇聯亦沒有於此時要求簽訂束縛力更大的條約的理由。</p>
<p>挪威的隣國瑞典却不能有這樣的獨立性。若干商人和政治家在戰前曾和蘇聯做過更多的買賣，現在却覺得保守中立不一定是上算的。最近瑞典答應借給蘇聯二億八千萬美元，期間為十五年，又與蘇聯訂約，在今後五年內，以值價一億四千萬美元的貨物交換同量的蘇聯貨物。此項交易使瑞典和西方國家的貿易大為减削。</p>
<p>挪威的情形是不同的，它期望於聯合國的成功。為了使它擺脫蘇聯或其他國家的經濟束縛，挪威已將前任外長賴依貢獻給聯合國。挪威現政府相信經濟上的調和可由國際協議獲致。挪威當局決心在牽入東方或西方的旋渦以前先試一試這一種辨法。</p>
<p>本年度聯合國會議關於設立國際貿易機構的決議，對於挪威的任何新的經濟動向都有很大的關係。這北歐的極西國家同時也是國際銀行和國際貨幣基金的會員國。至於端典則還沒有加入這兩個機構，對於它們的價值似乎還抱着觀望態度。</p>
<p>同時挪威還不願意正式接受美國進出口銀行預備給予它的五千萬美元信用借款，那是因為美國法律有一規定，外國向美國購買的貨物均須用美國船隻運輸。以國外運輸為土要出口業務的挪威，並不急於利用少數的美元以應付它自己能够完成的事業。</p>
<p>挪威和蘇聯所訂的貿易條約包括以挪威的魚類交換蘇聯的木炭和其他化學原料。經濟代表團並沒有放棄考慮將來的長期合同，但是，在目前，挪威業於和他國締結暫時合同。供應部長韜普及財政部長布洛福斯認為此類條約最能保證挪威達到明年年底全部復興的目標。</p>
<p>蘇聯如果讓挪威自由發展而不加干涉涉，也許對它是有利的。蘇聯可能利用挪威目前的主要出口貨如紙張，活動房屋及無產，但是即使這些挪威貨物减到最少數，蘇聯也還可以維持下去。</p>
<p>蘇聯所特別關心的事情，他是利用大部分的挪威商船，能够出入鐵礦區那維克，並獲得挪威鐵廠中的鋼鐵。</p>
<p>一九四七年開始時，挪威的情形比較良好，而且漸入佳境。生產量已達到戰前水準。貨幣的發行額雖漸漸增加而有通貨膨脹之處，但政府力謀控制，並增加外幣進備。</p>
<p>房展建築比較落後，但較之納粹侵略者所糟蹋的其他各國的房荒情形，是不可同日而語的。糧食相當充足，而且日漸增裕。衣着和皮鞋雖仍缺乏，但供應量已較半年前增加。運輸業是挪威建設與繁榮之鑰。商船的盈利通常可以抵銷入超，現在此項盈利逐漸增加，不久當可使挪威恢復有利的貿易差額。</p>
<p>漁業是挪威主要的國內貿易，一九四六年的補獲量造成了新紀錄。捕鯨船業已出發捕鯨，將滿載而歸，以充實國家經濟。蘇聯對於這一項工業開始發生興趣，特地請求挪威帮助它熟習捕鯨技術。</p>
<p>在今後數年中挪威將發展各項新工業，第一，因為作為生產國的德國已經完完大吉，有許多市場可以奪取。第二，因為德國工業毀滅後，從前向外國購買的許多東西，挪威不得不自行製造。工業計劃中最大的一項計劃是六千萬美元的鋼鐵製造廠的建造。</p>
<p>工業家認為在全世界缺乏鋼鐵材料的今日，這一個計劃是必要的。挪威一向靠礦石出口所獲盈利來購置鋼板和鋼皮，目前的計劃需要每年在國內生產二十萬噸的鋼鐵。</p>
<p>此外尚有擴大水電設備的偉大計劃，但進行遲遲。同時對終發展塑料工業以應國際市場，發展人造絲及其他織物以應國內市場，亦相當努力。</p>
<p>挪威人對於蘇聯和瑞典締結的貿易協定表示異常關切，甚至憤慨。他們特別期望得到瑞典的電機，但是現在担心着所定購的電機恐將獲得一小部分。他們更覺得挪威對蘇聯的地位已經因瑞典的讓步而削弱了。</p>
<p>挪威共產黨對於瑞典貸款蘇聯一事完全贊成，並且要求本國採取同樣措置。但若干共產黨員在希特勒侵蘇以前有和納粹勾結的嫌疑，故今日並不受人注意。</p>
<p>蘇聯的經濟勢力已侵入芬闡和瑞典，這勢力是否將更深入挪威，這首先要看挪威的態度和努力而定。</p>
<p>挪威人對於前途很拘樂觀。戰事既已結束，他們可以專心計劃一切了。他們很快的從德軍佔領狀熊回復常態。在復興建國的努力下，不出數年，挪威又將變成一個富強的國家，是可以預卜的。</p>

<p>約有二百名，隨後追趕，卒將八七〇號警士張平安拖去。同時有落差警員一一〇八號，一〇七四號，一〇五三號三名，經過眉州路朝陽路傷兵醫院門口，亦被拖進院內。當警員逃走時，傷兵隨後曾開放多槍，幸未傷人，當時警員等見傷兵緊追不捨，即躲入眉州路派出所內。傷兵等抵達是處，即持石塊木棍竹竿及無火藥之手榴彈，向該所亂擊，並將派出所招牌及玻璃門窗搗毀，由巡官潘兆鴻外出勸阻，被用鐵棍猛擊頭部二下。同時傷兵醫院院長王祥麟亦追蹤到來</p>

<h3>威克艦被俘華員　要求美海部撫</h3>
<p>華員代表招待記者</p>
<p>﹝本報訊）美砲艦威克號於抗戰期間，停泊於黃浦江上，一九四一年十二月八日，太平洋戰事發生，日本海軍將該艦劫去，　上美軍曁華員，爲日寇全部俘虜，錮禁於閘北氣象台集中營，旋解往南京僞江蘇第一監獄，驅使被俘華員充當苦力，內數人因被敵寇毒毆，現成殘廢，中有劉寳顯，因不甘在敵寇鐵蹄下生活，乘隙遠脫，不幸爲日寇補獲，遂被另囚一處至今生死不明。勝利後威克砲艦爲我國接收、改名「太原」號。艦長美人史密斯在江海關服務，惟對於華員之善後，毫無下文。昨日下午該艦華員代表招待記者，由郭峯亭報告經過稱：「吾等被俘華員，被囚四載，個人身體，備受痛苦，家屬生活，借貸無門。勝利後雖船主史密斯予以同情，向美海軍部請求戰時撫卹，淮迄今年餘，毫無音信，旣未分派工作，蒙難期間薪金又未發給，典質一空，羅掘供窮，家屬嗷嗷待哺，實極人世之慘事，請求社會人士予以同情援助，並希能促起美海軍部注意，將吾等華員蒙難期間薪金及撫卹款項，早日撥下，則感激無涯」。</p>

<h3>靜安寺新任住持　持松法師是位學者　八年抗戰期間始終杜門不出　計劃今後多做慈善公益事業</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕去靜安寺拜訪改爲十方叢林後的首任住持持松老法師（見圖），恰巧還沒有回來，坐在方丈會客室裹，續祥師乃爲我們簡單的告知新住持過去的歷史，他說持松老法師是一位學者，是佛教的長老，曾兩决東渡去日。八年抗戰期間，一直寄居在本市淡水路關帝廟，雖然知道他的日本人，曾數度相邀，主持上海的佛教事業，但老法師始終閉門不出，八年中沒有接見一個日本客人。這次由佛教諸山護法居士，曁靜安寺兩序大衆，公推爲十方叢林首任住持，謙辭未獲，乃開示規約四條，經各方擁護後，亦就陞座就職了。</p>
<p>二個鐘頭後，我們在原處會到了中國佛教會上海市分會理事長持松老法師，並非如想像中白　星眉的樣子。看來淸瘦的身體，穿一件淺灰色僧衣，闊邊眼鏡後面有的是一對深沉的眼睛。</p>
<p>談起了寺產糾紛</p>
<p>老法師發言沉着，話題從靜安寺展開，老法師說道：「民初以來，靜安寺爲了爭奪寺產，料紛不絕。其實靜安寺至今還是負債，就只去年年底還靠借貸纔渡過了年。目前寺裏共有僧衆一百餘人，做佛事收租所得，剛够勉强維持開支」。說起靜安寺負債，亦就談起了民國以來爲了寺產所引起的糾紛歷史，以至於勝利後德悟，密迦兩和尚的因罪下獄。</p>
<p>靜安寺現有地產，據老法師說，除廟基外，共有四五十畝，包括靜安警察分局，靜安小學等地基。但其中大部土地。在民初被人以三十年，五十年，七十年的長期契的出租予人，所以現在多還未滿期，而租金在當時郤已一次收取。另外寺前的馬路，原不是寺產，爲了有益地方公衆，所以當初並沒有向工部局收取地價。</p>
<p>原先是一座荒村</p>
<p>談話時，正當隔牆靜安小學散學，噹噹的鐘聲和喧雜的人聲，妨碍了方丈室裏寗靜的空氣，續祥師雖然走前代我們　上了窗，但鬧聲仍不斷傳進到室中。老法師乃為我們說起靜安寺創自三國時東吳，到現在已有一千七百餘年歷史，原先本是一個荒村，而今當我們坐在方丈室裹時，耳際不世傳進了靜安小學的陸聲人聲和寺裹的梵唄鐘磐聲，且還可隱的聽到飛馳在寺前柏油馬路上一九四六年式美國汽車的喇叭聲。然而這裘本來是座荒村啊！</p>
<p>改制為十方叢林</p>
<p>要不是它隨着上海的繁榮而繁榮，這東南彿教名剎，當可减少許多爲名利而引起的寺產糾紛。古剎不會像今天那樣位處於大都市中，在它旁邊也不會是那些銀行舞廳之類的世俗塲所，靜安寺也許就出現於小橋流水竹篁密林之中，在高大的紅牆內，「出家人」當可淸靜許多，持松老法師亦不會再說「所有瑣務應酬幸勿相累」那樣的話了。</p>
<p>靜安寺從師徒相傳的剃度制而改制爲選賢的十方叢林，不能不說是一個重大的轉變。今後爭奪寺產的糾紛，或可因此而滅。老法師是一個學者，目前對寺務正在加以整理改革，計劃今後將佛事减少，而能多做一點慈善公益事業，在文化上亦有所貢獻。這樣就眞正符合了佛教救世利生的教旨了。</p>
<h3>伏波砲艦沉沒慘案　羅難官兵名單公布　海軍總部積極辦理善後</h3>

<h3>十年漲千倍　六區登記土地　評定標凖新價　市政府將定期公布</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕戰前上海地價增漲比例，原高於一般物價，而至抗戰後，則一般物價增漲之比例，反高於地價，適成相反狀態。據統計本市基本商品另售價格，以二十六年一月至六月爲基數，至三十五年十二月，相距不過十年，物價共漲六千另八十二倍。然同期內，黃浦區中西兩區各　地價，祗漲一千二百七十五借，每年平均的增一百四十倍。但在過去新興建設，土地需要最旺盛時代，平均每年增漲不過數倍，即最特殊之地點，每年平均亦祗漲十餘倍，至今每年增漲達百餘倍之多，並非爲地價之增高，而係幣值之跌落，故此種增漲，乃爲變態現象。</p>
<p>勝利後，本市有標準地價評議委員會之組織。最近因金鈔風潮後，物價一度劇漲，乃於日前召開會議，就本市已辦竣土地登記之黃浦·滬南·閘北·法華·引翔·漕涇六區之土地，就其區段等級，分別評定最新標準地價。</p>
<p>黃浦區</p>
<p>計分甲等二十六級，乙等二十級，丙等二十二級，丁等二十三級，戊等十六級。其中甲等一級爲南京路外灘轉角地段，每畝平均地價五億五千萬元。戊等第十六級爲桂陽路平凉路以北不靠路部份，每畝平均地價四百五十萬。</p>
<p>滬南區：</p>
<p>計分甲等三十級，乙等三十級，丙等二十級，丁等十五級。其中甲等一級爲十六舖沿舖地段，每畝平均價一億二千萬元。丁等第十五級爲龍華港及東廟橋路西一帶，每畝平均價一百二十萬</p>
<p>閘北區：</p>
<p>計分甲等二十級，乙等二十一級，丙等二十一級，丁等二十級。其中甲等一級爲北四川路虬江路一帶，每畝平均價九千萬。丁等第二十級爲宋公園路東北段及耽金港南段普善路西裹向地段，每畝平均價一百萬元。</p>
<p>法華區：</p>
<p>計分甲等十九級，乙等二十二級，丙等十八級，丁等二十四級。其中甲等一級爲愚園路地豐路轉角地設，每畝平均價五千萬元。丁等第二十四級在薪浦匯塘北鐵路西一帶，每畝平均價七十五萬元。</p>
<p>引翔區：</p>
<p>計分甲等八級，乙等十級，丙等二十級，丁等四級。甲等一級爲其美路狄思威路轉角，沿狄思威路天同路同嘉路轉角，每畝平均價二千二百萬元。丁等第四級爲李家溝奚家浜一帶，每畝平均價八十五萬元。</p>
<p>漕涇區：</p>
<p>計分甲等三級，乙等五級，丙等三級。其中甲等一級爲龍華鎭潘家宅及漕河涇鎭，每畝平均價三百萬元。丙等第六級爲新涇港北許家宅等地段之農地，每畝平均價六十萬元。各該區分段詳細地價，將由市政府定期公佈。</p>
<p>李士特（Dist）有云：「國家福利進退之測騐，未有較此土地價值之漲落爲標準更明確者。」吾人就每畝五億五千萬與每畝六十萬之地價相較，即可窺知今日何處爲上海最繁榮之地段。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢　法律質疑</h3>
<p>陳良問　某甲有房兩間在租與某乙之前，議定在某甲長子結婚時，必須遷讓，是故未收受其任何小費。去年某甲之長子結婚，欲其即行遷讓，而某乙故意拖延，甲　子結婚後，侷促於小室之中。請問（一）不收其房租，已二年餘，可否限期令其遷走？（二）可否先將兩房間收回一間？（三）今某甲之决子，也將結婚，如某乙仍不遷延，則應用何種法律手段應付？</p>
<p>〔姜屏藩律師答〕甲將房屋兩間租與乙時，是否有甲之長子結婚時乙必須遷讓之特約，應憑證據。此項特約係收回自用之一種原因，按收回自用依法可以請求終止租的，返還房屋。甲不向乙收取租金，並非乙之欠租，不能作爲終止租約之理由。至收回一間或全部，常依實際情形之需要與否而定。甲自可向法院起訴。</p>

<h3>為國定教科書敬復鄧恭三先生（完）</h3>
<p>— 陸殿楊</p>
<p>英國古代歷為盎格羅薩克遜人，丹麥人，諾門人所攻克，威廉（William　the　Conquorer）且入主英倫。在異族侵入時，不免鐵騎踐踏，然在英國歷史上無不承認其事。平舖直叙並未以CCeltic　Briton為夏，而以諾門人，丹委人等為夷，更未認為英人之奇恥大辱。現在之英國人，己融合各侵入民族而為一大民族。我國既合漢，滿，蒙，回，藏，苗各族為大中華民族，編寫歷史祗可承認元，清兩代，記叙事實，無所褒貶，更須從積極方面強調各民族間文化交流及感情融洽之史實，以促進邊疆民族之內向力。部編課本須供計全國各民族青年閱讀，東北九省，熱，察，綏，寗，青，新等中學學生均讀此書，如照鄧先生意見，以漢人為中心，則邊疆青年讀之，將作何感想？所以部編初中歷史課本之內容，小節或有可以改進之處，其大原則，大前提似尚無不合，而為較勝於過去之歷史課本也。至本書編輯要旨第五條所謂「以傳統之歷史觀念為依歸者，「指上古時代之黃帝，堯，舜，禹，湯等傳說而言，故其下緊接「近代考古學上新發現之資料，其足以闡揚先民文化者，亦酌予採用」等語，蓋歷史教育與歷史研究不同，歷史研究者可否認黃帝等人之存在，而歷史教學者則在發掘資料尚不能銜接成有系統前，仍須承認古代之傳說，以示先民創造文化之功績焉。</p>
<p>鄧先生文中第二點為同人所不敢茍同者，為其指摘高小國語「壩工」一課。壩工即dike，亦可稱為水閘是水利工程中之重要工程。最近書報均在稱揚美國之T.V.A.，認為故羅斯福總統對於美國人最大之功績。所謂T.V.A.者即田納西州之壩工管理處也。我國近日亦有揚域安Y.V.A.之計畫，擬在宜昌附近為大規模之壩工。薩凡奇博士Dr.Savage應聘來華，視察黃河，亦主設閘築壩，以節水流。四川之所以成為天府之國，除天然原因外，人為之力量為灌縣之都江堰。都江堰為我國舊式之壩工，僅利灌溉，而成都盆地已賴此而足食。此外例證尚多，不勝枚舉。壩工調節水流，可免汜濫，可利航行，可以灌溉，可以發電（水電不用煤力，最為經濟，且電力甚大），是農，工，商業無一不受其利，謂其為人類最有益之工程，並不謂過，謂其為近代文明的主要動力，亦無不妥。我國文人對於科學工程之常識實太缺乏，故高小國認課本關於經濟建設之教材特別加多，希望下一代國民發言不致貽笑大方，而將來建國正有需於未來之千萬水利工程專家也。</p>
<p>總之，部編中小學教科書由國立編譯館在抗戰期內後方人力物力兩俱困難之中，倉卒編成，以應急需，救濟書荒，其中難免疏漏之處。暫行本出版以後，不敢自信，迭經召集專家會譏，逐課修改，並分寄後方師範學院及國立師範，徵求意見，當時重慶附近各科專家及教育學者，或敦聘來館，或集會請益，或去函諮商，無不竭誠相助。鄧恭三先生亦即於三十四年夏正式應聘來館修訂課本之學者之一。初中歷史六冊即曾由鄧先生校訂，原期於暑期內完成，嗣延長至十一月底，方始　事。其間歷時五月，除第六冊外國史承告未深研究未荷修訂外，其餘五冊，三冊就已出版之暫行本上修改，第四·五兩冊，就原稿上修改。送請鄧先生校訂之暫行本原已有不少修改之處，如上文所述秦始皇焚書坑儒一節即是。鄧先生校訂以後，又經他人校訂，然後彙集修正，發交七聯處改排，凡部編課本之經專家或學者校訂者，均於版權頁上刋列姓名，以示敬意，而誌感謝。滬版初中歷史第四第五冊版權頁上校訂人名下印有「鄧廣銘」，即鄧恭三先生也。前承鄧先生不棄，惠賜校訂，同負文責，不勝欣感。每常過談，輙以如何改進教材相勗勉。今幸初中歷史修訂本不久即可出書，鄧先生校訂之處可與世人相見。茲以各方來函詢問此事者甚多，特略加叙述，以告關心中小學教材之諸君子。</p>
<h3>東華三箭定天山　西聯遭全軍覆沒　逸園二萬球迷歡呼雷動</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕春光明媚，風和日麗，東華常勝軍與　聯　日作足球義賽於逸園球場，觀眾蜂擁而來，總計在二萬人左右，場內人山人海，南面屋頂　滿是球迷，開本年第一次盛況。門票收入，悉充南市體育聲建設經費，賽前　聯隊長向東華獻花，繼由市府秘書長何德奎代表市長　球，大戰隨之展開，結果，東華三　定天山，　聯　遭全軍覆沒，上半時戴麟經韓龍海各建一功，東華以二比零佔先。下半時　聯反攻殊烈，一時形勢緊張，幸東華力戰，得保安全。最後復由孫錦　再中第三球，奠定勝局。二萬球迷，歡呼雷動。</p>
<p>足球義賽：（上）東華　聯兩隊合影中立者何　　兵（下）張　綸救險（中國社攝）</p>
<p>東華</p>
<p>張邦綸　莊友仁　張林根　林文虎　韓龍波　於洽　李垚　孫錦順　韓龍海上　戴麟經　陳明哲下　賈幼良</p>
<p>西聯</p>
<p>麥尼蒂　曼亞　雪盤司汀　羅惠　麥律希　捷林考夫　諾高洛夫　愛德華　勞勃司托夫　卡洛列區　福恩下　柯普司汀上</p>
<p>阿戴建功　首開紀錄</p>
<p>三時正，裁判陳吉祥，巡邊吳守衡何春暉，兩軍列陣，西聯獻花，向東華致敬後，市府何秘書長開球，激戰隨起，西聯進攻，小黃毛單騎探營，阻於龍波，東華反擊，錦順穿針引綫，麟經試射，麥尼蒂拍出，李垚勾門，稍偏野逸。十分鐘時，西聯大舉進攻，五鋒並轡而入，諾高洛夫傳中，愛德華廿碼處猛射，球勢峻急，邦綸身手矯捷，救出險球。東華乘機再起，阿戴踏陣，深入腹地，迨曼亞追到，球已入網，一比〇，東華道開紀錄。</p>
<p>爆竹聲中　東華再捷</p>
<p>時距開賽僅十三分鐘，東華得手士氣旺鹽，幼良李垚，兩翼包抄，麥尼蒂應接不暇。嗣西聯一度獲角球機會，幸林根大脚解圍。混戰至上半時結束前五分鐘，老孫得林根接濟，傳麟經，遞龍海，離門十碼撥入網中，二比〇東華再建功勛，場邊爆竹，震耳欲聾，未幾上半時即告結束。</p>
<p>西聯反攻　徒勞往返</p>
<p>易地再戰，東華未有更動，西聯福恩登場，柯普司汀退休。接觸後西聯大舉反攻，企圖報復，福恩屢施突擎，未見成效，諾高洛夫，再接再厲，無奈邦綸，高擋低截，門禁森嚴，無法得入，小黃毛為龍波釘煞，亦無能為力。至八分鐘時，幼良龍海活躍異常，迭予西聯抨擊，麥尼蒂表演出色，戴元老親臨叩關，亦未能打開。西聯否極泰來，一時形勢，又見緊急。東華腹地，警報迭傳。然在最後關頭，均能化險為夷，保住江山。</p>
<p>老孫鐵腿　連破三關</p>
<p>至十七分鐘時，老孫乘隙而入，冷箭暗放，麥尼蒂撲空，又告命中，三比〇東華捷報三傳。此後西聯猶圖背城借一，然求勝心切，反多疎誤，龍海偷襲，麥尼蒂擅離崗位，正當危急之秋，曼亞趕到，始得解救。至卅八分鐘時，龍海傷脚離場，陳明哲入代，戰局雖乃緊張，然各無建樹，迨法定時間完畢，東華以三比〇擊敗西聯，保持常勝成名。</p>

<h3>港督憲杯足球　決賽再成和局</h3>
<p>華聯隊一場歡喜一場空</p>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕港本季足球六大錦標，形勢已誣大定，士丹利盾七人賽，早為星島所得，聯賽錦標也是星島天下，「紀念盃」則不幸為陸軍奪去，所餘的「督憲杯」，「特別銀牌」，和「國際盃」也決戰有期，「督憲杯」三十日由總會與協會爭覇，特別銀牌四月五號（週六）由星島與南華決賽。記得督憲杯，第一戰（二月九號），雙方以四對四戰和，今日再度決戰，加山上盛况空前。是日西聯以原定陣容出戰，華聯則因秋亭未返，兆榮傷足未出，陣勢略有改變，景祥帶傷督師。點將如下：</p>
<p>（華聯隊）協會</p>
<p>余耀穗（星島）</p>
<p>謝錦洪（南華）　侯榕生（星島）</p>
<p>馮坤勝（星島）　許竟成（星島）　劉松生（星島）</p>
<p>卓石金（光華）　鄒文治（南華）　馮景祥（星島）　朱永強（南華）　謝錦河（南華）</p>
<p>（西聯隊）總會</p>
<p>鮑維路（四二營）</p>
<p>地亞（四五營）　花留（香港會）</p>
<p>安達臣（空軍）　陳利（聖約瑟）　色曷（砲兵）</p>
<p>福特（四二營）　武倫（香港會）　伊胡士（海軍）　沙利雲（無綫電）　小告山奴（聖約瑟）隊長</p>
<p>各一和局</p>
<p>三時半裁判葉九皋令下，雙方接觸，「神腿」景祥撥球進攻，球在西聯腹地混戰，四分鐘時，石金得機傳中，文治接應及時，十五碼處起脚，球向左角入網，華聯先勝。</p>
<p>七分鐘，西聯進軍，錦洪一下大意，被告山奴將球傳中，武倫奔前急射，耀德欲救時，球已飛進網內，和局初成。華聯眼見心雄，急圖進攻，但見景祥妙傳石金，「生鷄仔」一馬躍前，猛然射去，竟被鮑維絡仆地撲出，殺得好。</p>
<p>此後華聯緊握全場攻勢，到三十二分鐘時，石金一射中柱，永強再項，又高越門楣，嘆聲西起。無何松生遠施勁射，又不中，最後時機，文治在十碼左右猛射一脚，亦為鮑維路托出，於是和局完畢上半時。</p>
<p>又成各二</p>
<p>休息後，西聯閃電進擊，告山奴輕吊門前，糧德竟撲空，伊胡土乘空一頂，球落門前，福特一撥，西聯轉佔勝局。</p>
<p>未幾西聯捲土重來，福特疾進傳中，伊胡士球到人到，勢在必得，耀德冒險撲下，將球推出，幸得不負。</p>
<p>斯時華聯錦洪，文治，石金接連受傷，西聯却氣勢正盛，華聯情勢險惡，眾意為必販無疑。卅分鐘過後，球被踢爆，重換新球，景祥也與永強調位，果然局勢轉好。</p>
<p>卅六分鐘，「神腿」得球前進，一脚傳出，落點絕佳，永強隨球殺進，認門猛叩，再成和局，二對二。</p>
<p>各三終場</p>
<p>不兩分鐘，景祥，文治，石金齊進圍攻，景祥遠吊文治，文治一脚，鮑維路衝出截救，不料永強閃進，俯地將球頂入網內，三比二，國產球迷歡聲雷動，震撼加山。看來錦標穩得，誰料在最後一分鐘間，福特又自邊陲直進，底綫灣中，伊胡士門前頂入，三對三，又是和局終場。盃落誰手？，待第三次決鬥了！</p>
<p>這場球，華聯可以說，應敗不敗，應勝不勝，真是一場歡喜一場空！</p>

<h3>美國毛織廠商錤有待　中國羊毛源源供應　存毛如何運達海口乃為先決問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中美農業技術合作團調查報告；中國羊毛事業之發展，亟應注意其貿易之途徑。恢復中國干毛出口貿易最要之舉，應先調查國內各地現有羊毛存量若手，存於何處，及如何設法運達海口。蓋必須將存毛運至海口，正常貿易方能開始。美國羊毛廠商，急於期待中國羊毛於可與他國所產地毯羊毛售價相競爭之條件下，經常源源供應。美國羊毛廠商，極喜中國羊毛之優點。如售價不太高於其他各國毛價，則頗樂於採購。羊毛與其他出口商品相同，必須有經常不斷之來源，以供應廠商之需要。現人造羊毛，雖已問世。以致地毯羊毛，多一勁敵。但人造羊毛之耐久力以及適用性，當不及天然羊毛。故如能經常隨時隨量供給品質優良，合於標準之天然羊毛，美國廠商仍願購買。中國羊毛貿易之途徑，旣長且艱。蓋在交通困難之國家，固屬意料中事。</p>

<p>又據調查；中國現有羊毛，山羊絨，及駱駝毛存量，（一九四六年所產者及存於小羊商及羊戶手中者未計算在內，）計現存羊毛的二千三百萬磅，山羊絨的計七十五萬磅，駱駝毛的計二百二十五萬磅。</p>
<p>此外靑海寗夏函省，可供交換物賽之羊毛存量，據調查：（以下所列價格，係一九四六年九月份之時價。）計靑海綿羊毛一一，八〇〇，〇〇〇磅，每磅國幣五五一元，總値五，五〇一，八〇〇，〇〇〇元，寗夏春毛二，七五〇，〇〇〇磅，每磅九一〇元，總值二，五二〇，五〇〇，〇〇〇元。寗夏秋毛六六〇，〇〇〇磅，每磅一〇九二元，總值七八三，二〇〇，二〇〇，〇〇〇元。寗夏山羊絨五五〇，〇〇〇磅，每磅一四二四元，總值五，二六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。寗夏駝毛一，六五〇，〇〇〇磅，每磅三二〇〇元，總值九，二八六，四二〇，〇〇〇元。以上合計各種羊毛五，六一〇，〇〇磅。</p>
<h3>債券募銷手續　財部今可核定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕卅六年短期庫券及美金公債基金監理委員會，定於八日中午，在中央銀行三樓會議室，召開成立會議，財政部俞部長將親臨主持，已定於今日乘晚軍來滬。至於債券募銷上之技術問題，亦經公債司長陳炳章與國行洽商具體解決辦法，電請財部核定。預定本日（六日）可有答覆，俾便各經募行莊遵循辦理云</p>
<h3>運用生產貸款　未能盡如人意</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕生產貸款巡迴檢查團之工作，大部已告完成，目前正將所得材料，加以統計歸納。聞國行張總裁亦向該團索取資料，加以研究，作爲今後放款時之參考。關於各工廠對貸款之運用，頗有値得改進之處，如有少數工廠貸得鉅款後，本身不必使用全部，而以一部高利出借與其他工廠，此其一。亦有以生產貸款償還　債，而不照契的購買原料者，此其二。其他值得改進之處尚多。將來巡迴團將提出具體意見，送陳四聯，作爲今後業務上之參考。</p>
<h3>原料昂貴銷路滯　絲織業處境難</h3>
<p>據絲織業方面消息：目前該業處境危殆，已瀕於銷路停滯狀態。蓋春季原爲絲織品旺銷時期，本年以來，銷路反無多大起色。且目下原料昂貴，成本過高，設若織或花色貨品尚可維持，織成大路貨品則必致虧拆，惟二者銷路均全無把握。目前該業所以維持原有生產，一爲使機器生財，不致誘爛，另一爲解雇工人頗爲困難，但此種現狀，勢難持久。又稱：該業合組之絲織產銷聯營公司，亦處於同樣困境，該公司所織外銷綢緞，目前已達八千餘疋，全部朱有外銷。其出品原以印度爲對象，但迄今無法展開，其主因爲自前月外匯調整後，印商咸取觀望態度，致使吾絲織業更難樂觀云。</p>
<h3>經濟部函請中信局　繼續收購外銷物資</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部近據各關係方面呈請收購茶葉，羊毛，麝香，以及華北等地之皮毛藥材等外銷物資，並爲挽回華北經濟危機，經部以各地外銷物資，以前無法推動外銷，大致原因，不脫物價運費過昂，外匯匯率太低，茲外匯率甫經提高不久，運銷出口，推行或較易。而以前專負收購外銷物資職責之復興公司，其業務已由中央信託局接收，故經部特函中信局，請予繼續一併辦理購運，協助農村經濟之復蘇。聞中信局建議抑低產地價格，復由四聯總處令飭當地省銀行，辦理押匯至重慶或上海，以便利商人經營運銷。如進行順利，而產地價格適宜，則中信局將隨時注意國外市價及買主，並儘量在渝滬或其他重要口岸收購，積極設法運銷國外。現聞財政部業已轉飭各關係地方銀行，衡酌實情，積極辦理該項出口物資之押匯業務云。</p>
<h3>中蠶轉變展營　仍由國家督導</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中蠶公司爲遵照經濟緊急措施方案之規定，擬將公司所屬各廠估價後，分期發行股票，使逐漸轉發爲民營之事業，詳細辦法正在擬訂之中。據有關人士表示：中蠶督導之業務，仍將保留，經費由國家負擔。企業部份則設法售與民間。公司目前共有七廠，其資產估計約値三百億元。目前職工共萬餘人，不久將設一研究機構。又中蠶公司三週前提出之建議書，送呈政院已久，惟因政府改組在即，迄未接奉核示。本年蠶絲之收成，如收購價格能顧及農民之成本，可望能達七萬擔之數額，其中三萬擔可用於外銷，</p>
<h3>國產布疋棉織品　在星洲市價衰落</h3>
<p>〔星加坡訊〕此間布疋黑市價格，日見低跌，吉寗街一帶布疋零售者，開始以中國布廉價拋售。柳條布每碼六角，其他國布每碼最高價八角，唯以花布較少，尚未見拋售。該批拋售者，由香港輸往，批發價每疋廿八碼十四元，是爲該市塲最低價格。近由於日本布一千二百萬碼將到，貨主急於脫售，價較前月低跌百分之百。但意大利布，英國花布，價格未跌，每碼仍站於二元半左右。白斜紋布黑布價較公價高，每碼二角左右云。</p>
<p>又訊，政府正式宣佈棉織品准許出口，布疋運往馬來亞以外地區，輸出前可向政府請領出口准證。查當局前此對香港入口之布疋，曾規定各入口商可按入口數量百分之二十五輸往馬來亞以外谷區。現時布疋銷路最佳之地區，當推爪哇婆羅洲蘇門答臘各地。荷蘭刦船影響下，此路頗形呆滯云。（按荷與印尼政治協定，己於三月二十五日在吧城沙利私邸雙方簽字，星與荷印貿易當呈活氣。）</p>
<h3>墨西哥金幣　出口價減低</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約五日電〕據可靠消息：自四月七日起，墨西哥銀行對於出口金幣，每五十披索，將自五〇·五〇美元，减至約四十九美元云。</p>
<h3>榨油所需大豆　數量再行增加</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中信局沈副局長告記者：吳市長曾與國行張總裁洽商，希望申信局能經常以平價大豆供應本市各油廠，以期穩定食油市價。現張總裁已去電東北，在收購之大豆內，再撥六千噸即日運滬，如此連同已抵達之四工噸，已有一萬噸之儲量。至於配給之爲經常或暫時，以及配售時之價格及數量等，現正在研究之中，一二日內即有一詳細辦法可公布。</p>
<h3>閩茶產銷概況</h3>
<p>爲我國六大產茶省份之一，佔閩省出口貿易首位之閩茶產區，廣達廿餘縣，面積五十餘萬畝，茶農茶工的三十餘萬人，戰前產量年的三十餘萬担，全盛時曾逾四十萬担。抗戰初期，政府鼓勵增產，產量維持廿二萬担。太平洋戰起，外銷一蹶不振，內銷亦趨疲滯，自二十七年迄卅四年間，每年平均產量僅四萬餘祖。其遞减之速，令人興嘆。據統計去年產量，僅三萬九千五百六十祖，的當二十六年五分之一，福州全年度出口，僅值九十億六千餘萬，惟仍佔輸出首位。按閩茶因氣候土壤之得天獨厚，品種優良，過去外銷，以紅茶爲主。例如閩東福鼎之紅茶與「白毫猴」，特為美國　　聯　　　　　　　和茶　　倫　市塲、武　　名產「石　水仙，」曾有洋「茶王」之稱，其「大紅袋」「白鷄冠」更爲膾炙人口之珍品。今後如獲充裕之貸款，使减　成本及改良產製技術，當不難恢復其銀煌之歷史地位云。</p>
<h3>各地郵政儲滙局　分別調整業務　鄭州辦事處升格為分局</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕郵政儲金匯業局自谷春帆氏接任局長以來，對該局行政設施及員工紀雜整飭不遺餘力。除設法與郵局密切取得聯繫，共謀郵政儲匯業務之擴展外，一面對於各地分支機構之營業狀况詳加審核，分別予以調整。現悉；該局鄭州辦事處最鈑業務頗爲發達，將於短期內升格爲儲匯分局。同時汕頭，九江，贛州，衡陽，開封，瀘州等分局業務較爲遜色，均分別降為辦事處，以副實際需要。又台山，梅州，韶關等分局及辦事處十餘處則予撤裁。所有各該局處原辦之儲匯業務，均飭移交當地郵局接辦，以雀開支。將來調整之後，對於各該地方民衆需要，並無妨碍。</p>
<p>郵局受委代理庫務</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕國庫事務按公庫法規定，應由中央銀行代理總庫。惟中央銀行因郵政機構普遍，大部份地方遂均委託郵局代理國庫支庫。自三十二年十一月實行以來，郵局現有代理國庫機構達八百四十五單位，分佈二十一郵區，的佔全國各行局代庫機構總數二分之一。此對於協助國家推行庫政，及便利人民繳納稅款，殊多貢獻。近以國庫收支頻繁，郵局爲配合中央銀行國庫局需要起見，擬利用所普遍設立之代庫機構，凡設有郵局而無國庫機構地點，均擬受委代庫，以便達到全面代庫之目標，而能完成健全之公庫網。</p>
<p>又自軍政機關公款存匯辦法實行後，各機　轉匯庫款頻仍，且款額鉅大，各地代庫郵局匯兌能力原加限制，對於轉匯庫款不無困難。現爲便利各機關轉匯庫款起見，已經儘量提高各代庫郵局匯兌能力，並將原有限額一律取消。以後如機關轉匯各地代庫郵局立戶支用款項，經此改進後，當可獲得極大便利。</p>
<p>儲匯工會籌備會議</p>
<p>〔又訊〕全國郵務總工會儲匯工會第一次籌備會議，於四月六日九時起在上海九江路該會會議室舉行。報告開會意義後即討論提案十餘件，並決定於本年七月間，在上海召開第一屆全國代表大會。</p>
<h3>尙有存貨供應　紙市暫無問題</h3>
<p>（本報訊）記者昨以紙張限制進口以後之目前紙市情形，分訪本市若干出版家及紙商，歸納言之，目前由於國內交通未復常態，出版物外埠行銷困難，同時由於一　　　方普遍　　，目前紙張需要，各家尚有　貨可以供應。在來源方而，則外商均願供售，惟以限制關係，除政府規定配額之數目外，絕少私貨進口。目前紙市所以尚能穩定，端賴各家現存少量存貨供應。如將來存貨一旦用馨，配額紙張有限，而國產紙質量，均不能源源供應，則紙荒之嚴重及紙市之波動，可以想見。</p>
<h3>美國石油產量</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約五日電〕截至三月二十九日止之一週內，美國石油生產量平均每日總計四，八六五，〇〇〇巴禮（Barrel），按以前一週內之每日平均產量爲四，八六二，〇〇〇巴禮，又一九的六年同時期之每日平均產量爲四，四二四，〇〇〇巴禮。</p>

<h3>爪哇僑落伍新途徑</h3>
<p>〔星加坡訊〕星洲與爪哇貿易商，近頗有以國幣轉匯之方式經營貿易者。即由爪哇之聯號辦理國幣收匯手續，即以收匯之款額換取貨物　屋，以商業途徑售出，轉換叨幣，而匯往國內。此方式於中荷外匯停塞下，間接溝通僑匯，公私上不無裨益。</p>
<p>刻下該商家國幣收匯，以叨幣四元換國幣一萬元，爲爪哇收匯之比率，然後以叨幣對尼加幣之黑市價，爲該地民信匯價之標準，（目下該地民信收匯多爲國幣一萬元，收取尼加幣二十餘盾不等），由此每萬元國幣可獲二元左右，聞經營此者已有五家云。（按荷市協定簽字後，貿易統制，行將開放，香港尼加幣突上漲，星荷貿易當活濯，星港布市亦有生氣，此僑匯新途徑之景氣恐亦不久也。）</p>

<h3>管制下的日本</h3>
<p>— 陳訓悆</p>
<p>引言</p>
<p>一九四五年九月二日聯合國接受日本投降，迄今一年有半。管制日本狀況，因系統性之新聞報道尚付缺如，致令國內人士未獲透澈印象，盟軍總部委克阿瑟將軍特於本年二月間邀集我國記者前往參觀，經數度接洽結果，京滬平津谷報記者十人所組成之中國赴日記者團，即於二月廿六日搭機東渡，除參觀東京，橫濱，京都，大阪，神戶，廣島等城市外，三月十一日復飛朝鮮漢城，十三日遄返東京，十五日歸國。計程數千里，為期十八日，參觀範圍相當廣泛。舉凡盟軍管制下之日本軍事，政治，財政，經濟，文化，教育以及戰時破壞狀况等項，所獲資料較多，印象尤深，此番記者自日本歸來，特就見聞所及，分篇記述，藉供關心日本問題者之參考。</p>
<p>盟軍的政策與組織</p>
<p>根據波茨坦宣言，盟軍管理日本，有兩項最高指導原則：（一）消極的，保證日本不再為成脅世界和平之侵略國家；（二）積極的，使日本永遠成為和平民主的國家。</p>
<p>為達到上述兩項目標，盟國決完實施以下四種方針：（一）日本之主櫂限於日本之本土，即本州北海道九州四國及聯合國所允許之各小島；（二）解除日本一切武裝；（三）使日本人民享有言論，出版，信教及集會等自由；（四）發展和平自足之經濟。</p>
<p>以上四項方計，在日本投降之時，由中英美蘇四國同意，授權麥克阿瑟元帥負執行監督管制日本之責。茲於此項決定，麥帥在日有三種特權：（一）在日本有最高統治之權力；（二）可採取適當手段，貫澈日本投降條件及波茨坦宣言；（三）通過所屬軍政府（Military　Government)或日本天皇及日本政府發佈政令，行使統治權；如最高司令官認為執行命令之人員執行不力，可立即撤換。</p>
<p>以上三點，乃美國杜魯門總統於一九四五年九月二十二日於華府所宣佈之命令。此足以說明麥帥之職櫂，乃經盟國同意後，由美國政府所授與。是年十二月二十七日，英美蘇三國外長於莫斯科會議中，決定於華府組織一遠東委員會（Far　Eastern　Committee），並在東京設立盟國對日管制委員會（Allied　Councii）。此兩機構之設立，實質上對麥帥之職權可謂毫無變更。以遠東委員會而論，由十一國（中，英，美，蘇，法，荷，加拿大，　洲，紐西蘭，印度及菲律賓）代表組織，為一指導機構，但其一切決議，均需通過美政府而轉達麥帥，與麥帥不發生直接的關係。在美國政府，為奉行遠東委員會決議，設有兩個委員會，其一為國務院陸軍部海軍部聯合委員會（State　Department，War　Department，Naval　Department　Combined　Commitlee簡稱SWNCC），此為諮詢機構，所有決議案經該會討論後，交陸海軍聯合參謀部（Joint　Chlef　Staffs，簡稱JCS），發佈給麥帥之命令。某組織系統如下：</p>
<p>至於後一個機構，由中英美蘇四國代表組成，主席為美大使阿契遜，其決議不能直接拘束麥帥，其作用只在提供意見，並備諮詢而已。因此，管制日本最直按和最高的執行人即為麥帥。遠東委員會則在理論上是最高決策機構。</p>
<p>盟軍總部（Supreme　Commander　for　the　Allied　Povers，簡稱SCAP）的組成,以麥帥為最高統帥，下設參謀長，組成參謀本部，下分兵員（G1），情報（G2），作戰（G3），補給（G4）四組，由副參謀長四人兼任各組主任，本質上仍為一幕僚機構。此外為便於分工合作起見，於參謀長之下，復分充九廳，其職掌如下：（一）總務廳（Executive　Section）：執掌總務事宜。（二）外交廳（Diplomatic　Section）：執黨聯合國駐日代表機關與個人間之折衝事宜。（三）政治廳（Goverment　Section）：執掌一般民政事宜；朝鮮行政，亦由該廳負責管轄。（五）經濟科學廳（Economic　and　Scienlific　Section）：執掌級濟·金融·產業·貿易事宜。（五）天然資源廳（Natural　Resources　Section），執掌農·林·水產及鑛業等事宜。（六）涉外廳（Public　Relation　Office）執掌情報·宣傳·公報關係等事宜，並闢新聞記者招待室。（七）民間情報教育廳（Civli　Information　and　Education　Section）：執掌新聞·廣繙·電影·教育·宗教·美術事實，以負賣佔領區居民之啟蒙工作為其主要任務。（八）民間通訊廳（Civil　Communication　Section）：執掌通訊設施之復興重建事宜。（九）公共保健福利廳（Public　Health　and　Welfare　Section）執掌醫藥行政及公共衛生福利事宜。（十）法制廳（Legal　Section）：執掌調查及控告戰犯事宜。其組織系統略如下圖（表二）：</p>
<p>以上各部門，均設在東京，至地方各府縣則由駐軍組織軍政府，凡日政府之行政機構所在，必有美軍政府之設立。其任務為督促日本政府執行盟軍總部之命令，其有執行不力者，得隨時糾正之。盟軍總部對日本政府發出命令時，同時通知佔領軍，日政府接到命令後，即通令各級行政機構並通告人民遵辦。佔領軍接到命令後，即通知軍政府，各級法廳及各地駐軍，轉知日本人民。及日本中央政府執行不力，可由盟軍總部參謀本部直接予以糾正，凡地方政府及人民執行不力，則由中央政府督促之，或由法院繩之以法，必要時可出動駐軍強制執行。茲將執行系統圖解如下（表三）：</p>
<p>此種管制方式，其優點在於盟軍管制機構與日本政體制度各自獨立，不致紊亂，此其一。由日本政府直接管理日本人民，而盟軍只負發佈命令及監督執行之責任，於日人之觀感，較有良好之反響，此其二。但其弱點亦即在此：同盟軍各級機構既不負執行之責任，故對技術上之各種問題，不能有深切之體騐。日本政府與人民如果上下其手，就不容易發現其弊端。佔領日本之初，美方並不忽絡到這點，G2情報組織之加強，即為明證。但是日久玩生，以日人之善於逢迎，美人之不念舊怨，盟軍總部命令是否能澈底執行，不失原意，是值得我國及盟國人士嚴密注意的。</p>
<h3>浙贛路舖軌工程　四十四天完成百餘公里</h3>
<p>— 三月二十日快訊　黃岑寄自金華</p>
<p>自諸暨到金華，浙贛路工程處釘道隊員工，以四十四天的時間，完成一百〇八公里的鐵道舖釘工程。</p>
<p>四十四天不算長，再除却春雨濕漉的日子，實際的「工作日」最多亦祗三十來天，而這一次他們能以這麼一個「突擊」的姿態，造成每日平均舖軌三公里以上的嶄新紀錄，這中間，釘道隊員工的工作精神和按術，不得不使我們驚奇和佩服。</p>
<p>勞働工人　緊急興奮</p>
<p>記者今晨往返金華車站附近，察看其舖設工作經過情形。</p>
<p>冷落了五年的金華站門，今天霎時熱鬧起來，軌道旁邊密密層層地站了數千的觀眾，當中來往着四百多個勞働工人，工頭和年青的工務員們興奮地在帮忙着指揮着。起先：一輛輛的卡車駛過，逐尺拋下枕木，背後工人即將其就正，並作着「實土」準備。第二步，工人們從黝黑的材料車上，將鋼軌搬下，迅即以之安置滑輪車上沿軌推進，第三步將鋼軌卸下與前段釘接，第四步就開始「敲釘」「絞螺絲」「測距」「填土」等必要而零碎的工作。一段一段的啣接經過，比之普通　「踱方步」的先生們跑路還要快，工作人員充滿一副融洽歡樂氣象，在祖國百般落後，事事不求效率的今天，我們看到浙贛路員工這末一副苦幹實幹精神，心頭正不知有多少感動和欣慰！</p>
<p>金華蘭溪　尅日接軌</p>
<p>承該路工務員程君澤潤的介紹，往參觀其附掛於機關車後首的釘這隊辦公室。小小的一間車廂，住着好幾個都是剛從大學畢業不久的工程人員。他們既年青，又充滿一片忠於工作的熱烈情緒，他們爭着訴說這趟破紀錄進展的經過，並指示掛在壁廂的各種統計表給記者看包括「釘道日誌」「工作人員累計表」「進展速度統計表」等，他們是二月一日開始釘道的，諸暨距杭州（64+100），順此算下，五日至外陳（74+100），十日至片頭（81+170），十四日至安華（87+657），十八日至鄭家塢（94+672），十九日至大陳（99+164），二十三日至蘇溪（107+990），二十七日至義烏（119+191.80），（按義烏至杭州已於三月四日通車，每日兩班），華金段三月一日開始舖軌，五日至義真（133+351.75，九日至航慈溪（139+230），十一日至孝順（146+408），十三日至塘雅（156+987），十六日下午四時到金華。浙贛綫自杭州至此，已舖近一百七十二里路軌。全綫預計六月可舖至衢州與江衢段啣接，雙十節左右可全部通車，金華至蘭溪即日開始按軌，聞月底亦可完成。</p>

<p>浙贛路卜山溪橋被破壞情形（本報記者黃行天寄）</p>
<p>總工程師　癉精竭慮</p>
<p>局長兼總工程師侯家源氏，在盛大歡迎下，十四日抵此，十五日即遄返衢州巡視，提起侯局長，大家總還記得起當年趕修湘桂路時自己坐火車頭，修舖一里開進一里的動人經過，這趟重掌浙贛路時，仍是以這副精神來幹，前一些時候，還有一些人西某種緣故與侯局長鬧過蹩扭，甚至晋京請願等等。但，這些謠謗始終敵不過他那一副硬幹精神。為什麼勝利後一年多，工程推進遲滯，而經他接管後，便立刻完成如此迅速？可見事實是永遠戰勝雄辯的。今天，有誰不對這位為祖國鐵道工程盡心竭力的工程師油然起敬呢？</p>
<p>釘道隊長　功勞匪尠</p>
<p>釘道隊隊長唐　如氏，唐山畢業，服務鐵路工作好幾年了。這趟他的功勞也不謂不大，在他統率之下，分為工程，機務，調度，料材四股，分由盧席光·袁効佐·錢光照·黃家林諸氏負責，他說，當年釘湘桂路時，每日廿四小時，最高紀錄均不過三公里多點，這次晚上拋枕木，日間工作，却有一半以上工作日是超過三公里的，臨到金華前數日特別快，三月十二日舖達四，二公里，破中國歷來釘道紀錄，十五十六諸日均在四公里左右，這種工作効率，就連他們也在意料之外云云。他們尤其佩服工作着的工友們，除少數熟練者外，餘各係臨時招募的，但是，當指導他們運用起身手來時，却也十分熟悉順利。局方為獎勵工友計，訂定獎勵章程，九十磅軌每日以二·五公里為基數，超此均按率加工資，像三月十二日恰值獎率百分之百，是日每人均為雙薪。平均三月份以來，工友們每天所得獎資均為百分五十以上。目下工資精工自一萬至一萬三，粗工七千至九千，要是沒有這樣添加，他們生活仍是算苦的。</p>
<p>浙贛路目前是甦醒了，這是一條作為東南五省命脈的幹綫，不僅浙贛兩省為然。將來南昌段延伸至株州與粵漢路連接後，合平漢，平津，津浦，京滬，滬杭，這一大大的三角地帶，不是將為祖國一切的中心了麼？</p>
<p>無始無終　開始新程</p>
<p>工程員們來自不同的角落（北洋·交大·唐山·廈大·英大……）當他們看到臨車站的最後一道軌釘合時，他們高興得都迸出眼淚了，工人們抖落了一身的沉重，當他們推着最後一道裝軌車到達終點時，嘴邊唱着：</p>
<p>「來啊，推啊，用勁啊……（工頭唱）杭育：（合唱）帮帮忙，齊用力（工頭唱）杭育……</p>
<p>一步路，當心別　却脚啊，杭育……</p>
<p>好了，刮刮呌，今夜去看戲啊，杭育……」</p>
<p>終點即起點，他們明天起又將開始一個新的工程了！但願這一次釘道隊員工的精神會留存在往後的日子裏面，我們有理由相信，在中國，祗要每個工程都有如此效率，真的，斯泰漢諾夫精神，畢竟在中國湧現出來了。</p>

<p>長春發生一轟動全市之自殺案，主角為長春青年中學職員陳輔漢，原係青年軍二〇七師砲兵，西康人，去年隨軍來東北，六月間在盤石縣黑石鎮作戰負傷，折斷右腿，今年任職青年中學，突於本月二十日晚服毒自殺於寢室，翌晨經伙夫送早飯發覺，急送市立第一醫院施救，因中毒已深，不治身死。留有絕命書及致其長市友人書各一封，其絕命書云：「國事凋零，山河破壞，貪污載道，舞弊橫行。人民時處凁餒，士卒無片刻休息。家道日繼以墜，肢體又很殘傷。吾儕不能以快刀斬亂麻之身手，挽此暴風雨之局勢，不能不浩嘆良深。尸位素餐，自覺徒耗公幣；能力不濟，妨害建國尤深。午夜思維，寸心惶恐。余為國家民族，固已盡最大之犧牲，然未能成仁沙場，殊深慚作。生有負於領袖偉大人格之感召，死不足以對先烈及總理在天之靈。嗚呼！已矣！余之死當為一般人所鄙棄，但余不願任何輿論界有所批評。余為國為民，致有今日之慘痛，非一般庸俗無能過肆妄語者。余良心無愧九泉瞋目。余應引以自慰。臨終前夕，書此以明心跡，陳輔漢留筆。三十六年三月二十日晚九鐘書於長春青年中學宿舍。</p>
<p>陳輔漢自殺原因，論者多以其傷時憂國，　血自殺，並無其他特殊原因。陳之友人談其為人，正直不阿，熱情充沛，富正義感，在軍中與長官同學相處甚好。</p>
<h3>參觀洛杉磯肺病院</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康訪美瑣記　遠槎三月廿四日舊金山航訊</p>
<p>上海虹橋療養院院長丁惠康博士於本年一月間，乘戈登將軍號赴美考察最新醫學及公共衛生，在舊金山登陸，曾晤及衛生局長祁求氏（Dr-Geiger）氏謂數月前該處曾有天花發現，氏即下令佈種牛痘，全市居民約八十萬人，於二星期內完全竣事。丁氏對於衛生行政推行之迅速深表贊同。二月初，抵浴杉磯為美國西南新興之大都市，面積約如比利時大，市容之廣，占世界第一位，居民約一百八十萬。丁氏由該地防癆協會之招待，曾往洛杉磯肺病療養院參觀，距市二十七英里，佔地八百英畝，採取隔離村落制，每定僅容一至二人，護士室與每個病人室，均可直接通話，節省時間，便利不少，病人毋須納費採用捐助方式，日前有俄兵三人住院，即由俄政府捐助五千美元。院址在威爾孫山麓，風景極麗。院內並有工場圖書館，禮拜堂等設備，亞烈夫療養院，距市二十五里，佔地一千英畝，為全美第三大療簑院。每星期舉行醫學會議一次，收容一千病床。該院以外科著名，凡旅行肋骨截除術，仿有空洞之曾在者，可將一肺全部除去，適有一例，於五日前施行該項手術，需時七小時又半，現正脫離危險，在X光像上已有顯著之進步。該院三分之一病人，屬於墨西哥人，可見環境與肺病之連繫性。市立醫院為該市最新建築之一，凡十八層，可容三千病人，為全世界最大之市立醫院，醫師二百餘人，同時為學術研究機關。丁氏觀察點為美國各大醫院病人均經住滿，因其早期治療，故人民容易恢復健康及其工作能力，與國人之臨時抱佛脚，至病危不進醫院，逈不相同，此其一。美國因診斷方法之進步，發現心臟病為致死症之第一位，肺病在十五歲至三十歲，青年人死亡症之第一位，以環境衛生優良之美國，尚且如此，則國人對於心肺病問題之嚴重，更不待論。茍能人人做到每年施行健康檢查，則於民族健康當有改進云。按：丁氏於一九三五年曾由衛生署派往歐洲各國調查防癆設施，回國以來，對於公共衛生，如學校健康檢查，X光防癆檢查，提倡不遺餘力，以私人醫師進而從事實地公共衛生工作，丁氏有焉。連日遍訪該國各醫學家，如心臟病權威湯姆生博士，X光專家卡德氏，極形忙碌，預計五月中赴紐約訪問醫事中心後，方可回國。</p>
<p>星期論壇</p>
<h3>青年技衛員當前之使命</h3>
<p>— 趙祖康</p>
<p>中國技術協會舉行成立一週年紀念會時，主席宋名適兄囑為致辭，臨時就感想所及，提出三點，以與協會同人相共勉。回寓更為增刪，寫成此篇，以供國內青年技術人員之參考。</p>
<p>三十年前中國科學社之成立，表現中國智識階級對於科學之認識；戰時中國工程師學會之創設，表示中國講求讀書致用的人對於工程之認識；而去年技術協會之成立，更進而表顯我國人對於技術之認識。由科學而工程，是從理論而到實用；由工程而技術，是從一部份的實用而到一般的實用。這是中國人接受西方文化的認識與運用的進步。</p>
<p>國家目前局勢的擾攘不安，我們技術員出路的不易，誠不能不令人覺得煩悶。但我願大聲疾呼，喚起我國青年技術人員千萬不可灰心短氣，反須加倍努力。當前我們所負的特殊的使命，也可說是應有的態度與精神，應有三種：一是「致用」，二是「求真」，三是「殉道」。</p>
<p>求學乃所以致用。技術人員都是學有專長者，由於國家的培植，家庭的負担，個人的努力，才得到專門學識，並非易事。我們就要用其所學，這是得到最高效率之道。所以目前國內一般情況雖不安定，環境雖或不甚滿意，技術人員的待遇雖不高，發揮做事的機會雖不多，但我要勸青年技術人員，還是要各守崗位，盡其在我的努力，人人能在任何情况之下用其所學，這是致用的第一義。</p>
<p>去年中央研究院開會，某鉅公演說，「還政於民，還科學於科學家」；某科學雜誌却批評應當說「還科學家於科學」。但我以為兩說都通。因為國內有不少科學或技術事業，並不交科學或技術人員主持，而研究科學與技術的，並不都做他本行內科學或技術的事，這都應當糾正。這責任在乎政府與創辦事業的人。我希望國內政治經濟文化各界的各級領袖，都能使得「還技衛於技術人員」，「還技衛人員於技術」，那就各項事業，定能辦得妥善而發達。這是致用的第二義。</p>
<p>現在環境困難，各種事業均感到財力物力之不足，青年技術人員，應在困苦的環境中，謀得他事業的推進與擴張，我們要撙節使用材料與人力，就是要能「因地制宜」，「因物制宜」。例如上海修理柏油路面輸入品硬柏油（Asphalt），不易得到，我人就要因地設法，儘量改用軟柏油（Coal　Tar）。上海的軟柏油不盡合於修路之用，我人就得製定準則（Specification），指導廠方照此製煉，這是因物制宜。其他類似情形甚多。抗戰期間，後方所做工程，如公路上，鐵路上，就地設計裝配的橋梁，又如兵工製造及化學生產，均不少先例。這是當前致用的第三義。</p>
<p>其次請談求真。真是真理（Truth）技術一辭，在英認為Technology，但英語中亦有稱為Applied　Science者，中文譯為應用科學。但Technology一辭，有人以為譯作實用學為當，而且照西方一部份的科學家意見，以為Applied　Science一名亦不妥，因為實用學不僅僅是將一種或數種科學的原理與方法應用到一種事業上去的「術」，他本身亦有理論。例如給水工程學，是從水力學，水文學，化學，地質學等種種科學融合應用而成。但他本身亦得研究出一種設計方面的理論。例如給水系統的設計，所以Technology固然不僅僅理論的「學」，而是在「實用」——實用學——，但也不僅僅是術——技術——，而還在乎也是一種「學」。所以在我國目前學實用學（技術）的人，應當於致用之外，還能求真。求真是學，是科學家的態度，我人惟能有求真的精神，乃能有所發明，乃能使實用學成為道地的實用學。例如土木工程師設計道路上面涵洞用Talbo公式，此公式在美國也僅適合於一部份地域，他是一種實騐的公式Empirical　Formula。在我國最好能根據自己的經騐另立一公式，這才是求真才，真才能致用，是實用學。</p>
<p>真也即是「實在」（Reality）。求真就是要能切實，敷衍塞　，好高鶩遠，都不切實，不能算有求真的精神。我國讀書人有一種可說是普遍的毛病，便是問他實際工作，每不免「罵虎了事」；問他計劃理論，却極其高深閎大。這一部份原因，由於大多數國人健康精力不及西人，疎於實幹，而偏於玄想。另一個原因，是由於農業社會的傳統習慣，缺少準確精密的訓練。我人只須一看一般人使用汽車的方式，對於保養，大多不注意何時應加潤油，車胎壓力應有若干磅，不少司機均以等閒視之。抗戰期間，公共汽車在中途拋錨，於是褲帶可以代替風扇帶，草鞋可以權充鋼板之一片，這種情狀，我想只有我國才會發生。這都由於不看重真，此與工業革命之注重效率與大量生產的精神，根本相反我人切憑痛改。此是求真之又一說。</p>
<p>再次談殉道。什麼是殉道？殉是犧牲生命，道是一種道德的信仰。古人說：「貪夫殉財，烈士殉名，」財固不足取，名亦是虛空。道是人類行為的最崇高的途徑。——道者路也，學技術的人應當以科學的原理方法——「學」，及有關國利民福的事功——「用」，做他的目標，他的途徑，他的信仰，他的道。為了這「學」，為了這「用」，犧牲利，犧牲名，犧牲一切，必要時，甚至犧牲生命，也都願意，這便是殉道。</p>
<p>近數年來，我常有一種感想，便是我國儒家的精神，在現代似乎應當與西方基督教的精神融合起來。儒家對於道，對於國家社會，具有一窮則獨善其身，達則兼善天下」的態度與抱負。諸葛孔明所謂「茍全性命於亂世。不求聞達於諸侯」亦同此意義。此種精神，我以為應當修正。還有大學上所說修身齊家治國平天下，這一套學問與做法，也不免有使很多讀書人一進學校便以未來領袖自期的流弊。在基督教似乎不然。基督的說教是平等，博愛，自由，服役，犧牲，與當時羅馬政治之權力及猶太教徒之信仰，顯有嚴重之衝突。因此，不惜犧牲生命，負上十字架而死，年僅三十有二。此種對於倫理，道德，經濟，政治，革命的精神，影響於西方文化者至深且鉅。至於在我儒家，雖孔子也講先事後食，先勞後祿，但常常給一般具有領導慾的讀書人所忽路。所以我覺得我們要提倡服務的精神，犧牲的精神，——革命的精神。</p>
<p>二月前，報載美國駐華大使司徒　登先生向學生演說，彷彿是主張我國尚需要一次革命，即是自由民主的革命。他的意思，大概是指思想上自由民主的革命，我所設的也正是如此。不過加上科學精神的革命。窮則獨善其身麼？不對的，窮則需要革命。我們所最需要的，就是思想革命，而技術人員就應担當起這個責任。</p>
<p>我們再看歐洲歷史，當十二三世紀時，十字軍七次東征，為的是保全聖地耶路撒冷。他的主動力，是宗教的熱忱。待到十六七世紀時，先後有哥白尼，蓋伯勒，伽列列奧，牛頓等諸傑，推翻托喇咪地球中心之說，而證明了地動力，創了新的字宙系統，甚至如伽列列奧以六十九歲之老年，能够反抗當時迷信舊說的教會，其後雖不得已而屈服，但據歷史所載，當其被迫跪於十個會宴的紅衣主教前面，終至放棄其學說，匍匐而起來的時候，喃喃自語道：「地球還是動着的啊！」於此可見他殉道的精神。青年技術人員，如能以終身從事於技術事業，以求福國利民為責任，自己如此，並能鼓吹他人亦如此，貧賤不移，富貴不淫，威武不屈，　種精神，便是殉道精神。能認識這種責任，便是能以此為使命。總之，當前的青年技術人員——二三十歲左右的人，應明瞭民生凋敝，國家危殆的轉機，與十年二十年後國家復興的責任，都在你們肩膀上，你們要督責自我，尊重自我，痛定思痛，加倍努力，要克服環境，創造時代，就得要負起我以上所講的三種便命，一，致用，二，求真，三，殉道。要能以科學求真的態度為基礎，以切實致用的事業為目標，以篤守殉道的精神為國家民族負起賦予之使命。那我中國的前途，一定是一百二十分光明的！</p>

<h3>買賣</h3>
<p>— 陳家驊</p>
<p>樣」的人物，什麼小販以沙啞的聲音，在門外大喊一聲的時候，她便會「來往」的嚎呌起來，或許她還不明白外面小販賣的是什麼東西，然而她那種唯恐買不到東西的神經緊張的樣子，見了足會使人發笑的。</p>
<p>每次當小販應允房東太太的『召喚」，跨進門來時，房東太太好像同他是知己一探，她會親熱的嘮嘮叨叨的問他，譬如是那兒來的？預備到那兒去？如果是晚上，或是中飯的時候，她便會滿臉露着笑容，留小販在家裏吃飯，或睡覺，她的話不外是：</p>
<p>「哇，做生意的，這裹用便飯吧，是時候了。</p>
<p>或是：</p>
<p>「這樣夜口，你在這兒　夜吧，旅館是太貴的。」</p>
<p>然而多半小版們是拒絕房東太太的好意的，假如曾經有過一次的話，那便是賣鷄子的那個老婦人了，因爲房東太太爲了表明自己的虔誠，常常把這句話掛在嘴邊的：</p>
<p>「沒有什麼的，上次賣鷄子的老婦人，也在這兒宿過一宵的。」</p>
<p>這可以說是房東對賣買的開塲白，大的是一個小時以後，於是便討論到東西的價目問題。</p>
<p>往往房東太太的還價出乎小販們異樣的驚異，因爲房東太太有地的「生意哲學」，那便是「對折」。她覺得「上門來」的小販的討價是特別狠的，所以不妨把價還得低一點。</p>
<p>如果小販們因還價太低，明知爭執沒有用，預備打算離走時，這樣她便會拉住他的担子，不消說，她的笑容是沒了，臉色已變爲靑的。</p>
<p>「怎麼便走了，這是還價呀，你還可以講哩！」</p>
<p>如果小版是三五百，甚至一二千的話，房東太太還是不肯就買的，却是嚷着：</p>
<p>「不是聖口呵，死板板的，一口咬定。」</p>
<p>然而多半小販因爲她的過份糾纏，便退了步的，終於房東太太笑嘻嘻的把又黑又粗大的手指，撫慕着自己的鼻子，表示高興的探子。以後的爭執，便是物品的數量上了，譬如嫌他的稱不是老斤，是十兩的，還要強添一點之類。</p>
<p>於是小販因爲吃虧太大，不免「這樣的婦人。這樣的婦人」咀咒一二句，那房東便漲紅了臉，惡狠狠的會同絕呌一樣的嚷着</p>
<p>「嘿嘿，虧本！不賺，鬼送到門上來——眞眞黑良心。」</p>
<p>她雖是這樣說，因爲便宜，她高興的樣子還是可以看得出來的。往往把買了的東西，如　獲的勝利品一樣，要告訴每一個住在她家裏的房客，她不但要使房客們知道自己已買了這樣可愛的東西，而且還要人稱贊一句這是；「便宜貨」。</p>
<p>假使當她問你時，如果你只是一笑，沒有回話的話，那她便要把墨黑的手指指着你的鼻子，賣斥便來了：</p>
<p>「你說，這東西貴嗎？怎麼一言不發。」至於你的回答說是這東西異樣便宜，自已也喜愛時，於是她便會閉不住嘴，笑把臉孔佈上了無數縐紋，却是說：</p>
<p>「那裏？那裏。」</p>
<p>房東就是這樣一個多變幻的婦人，愛笑，愛哭，愛駡，又潑刺，又兇狠，她會把你認是一個「好人」，但三數分鐘後，立刻又把你作仇敵視之。</p>
<p>如果你要進一層明白她的爲人時，讀者諸君，聽我告訴你一個最近的故事：</p>
<p>中　以後，房東把賣鷄　的小販呌來了。</p>
<p>這小販的挨四十光景，鄉野打扮，兩個鷄雜是又大又圓的，走在房東的後面。</p>
<p>「咾，聽你口音是！」</p>
<p>「我是紹興。」小販回答。</p>
<p>「哈哈，是大同鄉理，我們餘姚，視上手裏才住到杭州來的。」房東太太立刻顯得很親熱的　子，　極　　　　話，幽幽的回答着。</p>
<p>於是房東太太與小販便談了起來，他們很投機，房東太太並親自酌了一杯茶，她說：</p>
<p>「同鄉人，喝了他，」這樣立着的小販便在石櫈上坐下來了，笑嘻的接了茶。</p>
<p>他們從紹興，餘姚情形，談到做生意，　說，　　　　　題，然那　　二　　　　　　　　了。</p>
<p>「多少一對哩，同鄉人，」房東太太問，她顯得緊張的樣子。</p>
<p>「說實話，自家人九千一隻吧。」</p>
<p>「唉，太貴啦，同鄉人，一萬一對吧，客易紀，客易算。」房來太太說了，隨即蹲下來，用她又黑又大的手，去　筐裏捕捉小鷄了。</p>
<p>小販苦笑着，因爲這還價本使他失望了，一萬八，還了一萬，足足打了個對折，這損失太大了，於是他便很謙和的說：</p>
<p>「老板娘算一萬六一對吧，目家人，一個錢也不賺。」</p>
<p>「一萬一對好了，四隻，二萬錢，淸淸楚楚。」</p>
<p>「三萬四隻吧，我再讓二千，情面東西，川費貼給你。」小販乞憐的樣子。</p>
<p>但隨你小販怎樣說，房東太太咬定一萬一對，她說：</p>
<p>「你道人，硬到底，一點也不肯讓。」</p>
<p>「實在——」</p>
<p>小販還未說完，但房東太太已光火了，因爲她把「實在」聽爲「蝕本」了，她把小鷄一鄭，站起來，大聲吼着：</p>
<p>「蝕本，屁，你是財主？」　「正因不是財主——」小販瑟瑟的回答着，好像預感着有什麼不幸的事情發生一樣。</p>
<p>「不是財主，還蝕什麼臭本。」</p>
<p>「那末——」小阪苦笑了一聲，打算走了。</p>
<p>「走不得，我要買，你怎麼一口咬定？三萬，三萬，」</p>
<p>「對不起，老板娘！」小販顫抖着。一盼一顧的走了。但房東太太却顯出了怒容，把袖子一　，雙脚一跳，趕過去，死勁的拖住了担子。</p>
<p>「毫無道理的，爲什麼不賣？」她嚷着。</p>
<p>小販的臉漲紅了，人抖得極其厲害、很害怕的樣子，因爲預備逃，他用力一拉，這樣，拖往　担的房東太太便跌倒了。</p>
<p>於是一發不可收拾，房東太太忘了小販是同鄉，是自己人吧，便呼喊起來，似乎是哭的樣子：</p>
<p>「你打人，胆敢打人，到局裏去，局裏去！」</p>
<p>小販想逃，但給房東太太扭住了，而且她還送給他一個耳光。</p>
<p>在扭做一　的時候，門外跑進來的是崗警，於是房東帶哭帶喊的「這暴徒，這强盜呀！」向崗警報告了一通，於是小販便押到派出所裏去了。</p>
<p>以後，據說作爲「暴徒」「强盜」的小販被判了二月的徒刑，但因由他充作商會會長的一個遠房叔叔出來担保，僅僅「關」了兩天便出來了。</p>
<p>而房東太太却是已有了六隻小鷄，有一隻是全身黑黑的，極其活潑。房東太太每天喂牠們靑草與黃小米，並於天空有騰出現的話，她便會「殺千刀的，殺萬刀的，我家的小鷄不是你食的！」呼喊起來。至於這小鷄她向那裹買來，一總化了多少錢，讀者諸君，恕我寡見寡聞，我可不得而知了。（三六初春杭初稿）</p>

<h3>文藝的脂積層</h3>
<p>— 進洪</p>
<p>小說作風的偏向于「散漫」，幾乎成了廿世紀中葉一般的時尚。辛克萊·劉易士的大街還算好的，因爲它的章段很整飭，描寫上的生命力充沛。賽珍珠女士的「大地」，却有些那個了。造成這傾向的理由，大的很簡單：一，不外乎十九世紀末以來的舊寫實作風，時常爲求洗練過甚，頗成一種章句凝重的習尚，使讀者對于傑作，每每望而却步。二，對文藝的心理日漸變遷。從前許多讀者，時常認爲作品的思想與內容之應具的嚴肅性，是不可或誣苟衊的；彷彿它眞能够給人生指出什麼路綫。現在可不同了。它的輕鬆處，也就是它的優點。它的空洞，也就是它在讀者面　種「自作聰敏」</p>
<p>批評家說：</p>
<p>「作品所現的想象力，無論怎樣精密，終于不過是作者個人想象上的成功罷了。它未必就能代表「眞」。「眞」是非單純想象所能够獲到的東西。它非通過作者的視覺，藏入記憶的深層，以作日後『想象再造』之資，是不能在藝術上成立的。」</p>
<p>這話很具幾分道理。古諺云「以秦人而觀越人之肥瘠」，母怪乎風牛馬之不相及。</p>
<p>林語堂先生似乎也是懂得這個的，他的「如此京華」，雖言小說，固亦鈑干散體文式。然而大多數讀者褒獎它。豫材先生的作品，更不用說。這種不追求「洗鍛到家」的自然自在習尚，抑或因人而有所不同？抑或是描寫上的原理，原就不應與「自然」相悖？</p>
<p>與林語堂先生同時的另一個英語寫作家林文錚（Lim　Boon　Keng），二十年前，曾以一書「東方生活的悲劇」（商務版）而蜚聲國內外。他的體裁，較語堂先生嚴整多了，描寫的鈿膩，叙說的流利，縱是一個英美本國作家，也將不否定一辭的。更同有一些非常散漫的句法，穿插在那結構得很密凑的章段中，如「馬來人與中國人時常談得很親密，在生活習慣上表示對各自間的容忍。家族上冠以『託克』（Towkay，馬來人稱先生叫託克）的稱呼，中國人方面是司空慣見；它等于英文裹的『瑪斯忒』與『密斯蕊』。因此馬來人對于中國恭敬的稱呼，無。不加上託克。……」（首章P．4）</p>
<p>又如：</p>
<p>……在這篇叙事文裏，我們假定讀者們知道託克。彭阿貝相等于密斯忒阿貝彭，因爲中國姓氏時常是放在前頭，接後才是個人的名字，恰像作它的指導似的。」（首章P．5）</p>
<p>這等叙法，當然是活潑，而且穿插在一段描寫之後，大可使讀者鬆弛一下腦子。讀者心理上，也說得過去。它不是掉鎗花，更非插科打諢。它有些像人身上的脂積，可以增加一些肌膚的美。究竟精練結實的體質美呢？肢體內有脂積層爲美呢？人的鑑賞各自不同。某甲喜歡讀那描寫得一字不有的嚴肅作品，某乙喜歡體裁鬆散自然的作品。究竟誰的偏好可取呢？誰又來斷定！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血310</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「噢！……中國還有這種組織？」鶴見驚訝起來，並且十分興奮。</p>
<p>「是的，隊長。」正岩端正了姿式，放輕了聲音，「就是前幾天那個『失踪』的暴露事件，也是部下請託那位朋友，隻手辦理的！」</p>
<p>『哈…」鶴見高興起來了。剛要問下去，那個下女，已經來了。</p>
<p>「消息不大好哩！」下女很憂悉似的，「大使館說中村小姐確實到大使館去過，因時間太早，八點三刻，辦公處沒有招待。只有一個小書記官接見。中村小姐說要見大使老爺，取一封信，信很重要，必須自己說自領取。書記請小姐九時半再去，小姐答應九時半到十時準去。大使候到十點，中村小姐竟沒有去；大使老爺這才派人把信件加封送來了。」</p>
<p>鶴見聽到這裏，瞧了桌上那封文件封套一眼：</p>
<p>「小姐坐什麼車去的？」</p>
<p>「本館管事代叫的出差汽車，大概是『賀田租用自働車社』的車子。」</p>
<p>很好…請你對管事說，我要上軍部去。可是仍舊要小姐出行的那部車，仍舊要那個駛車夫，別的人不要！」</p>
<p>這接二迎三發生的事，把鶴見弄得有些五中煩亂了。</p>
<p>「我這一次非要弄得大糟糕不可！」鶴見似乎在自言自語。「我料到萍子的事，一定出了大亂子了。」他表示在上海要裁筋斗了。</p>
<p>「是的，隊長可也不必悉煩，也許中村小姐赴那個秘密的會，有重要問題躭擱了？」正岩這麼安慶鶴見。</p>
<p>「不能。」鶴見很果斷似的，「一定發生了更嚴重的情形，」鶴見重又拿起那封公園釣會的秘密信，遞給正岩：「這信上看不出惡意，這是一點，萍子小姐極細心，也極有經騐；如若有事絆住了，必有電話打來，大使館也必有電話去；這是第二點。從這兩點看，還能說不是發生了亂子？」</p>
<p>鶴見說着，又把那張奇怪字條，從桌上拈了起來，也遞了給正岩；好像要把萍子的事，都交給正岩負責辨理淸楚似的。</p>
<p>「華懋飯店0915。」</p>
<p>字條並沒有變樣子，仍舊還是這四個華文字，和一個號碼。</p>
<p>鶴見在屋子裏，繼續來回　　，深思不已。正岩拿着這張怪字條和那封秘密信，顚來倒去，看看字條，又看看信件。愈看，他臉上的神色，愈加迷惘，就像一個從來沒念過希臘文的人，忽然收到一封希臘文字的信件似的，任是顚來倒去，對於他，仍舊是一個謎，愈看愈不明白。</p>
<p>「有點新見解？」鶴見無聊地問。</p>
<p>「恐怕需要一點時問，也許找得出一些綫索。」</p>
<p>「綫索只能上外面去找，…大使館，華懋飯店，公園，…這兩種文件，大概是硝酸水裏洗刷過的，那裏會給你找到綫索？」</p>
<p>「是的，隊長，也許中村小姐在什麼地方乙擱着，需要一點時間，事情就能明朗了。」正岩只能拿這兩句話，顚倒來解說。</p>
<p>「哪裏能有多少時間？事情緊急得很……」</p>
<h3>桐花小唱</h3>

<p>霧　籠罩着山城，又是一度桐花飛白了。</p>
<p>妳走了，走向遼遠的海邊的地方，從此，在我平靜的心扉，妳投下深勢的偯戀，</p>
<p>像桐花一樣凄白的夜裹，我仍愛挑燈獨坐，塗寫着生命的詩篇，這桌邊，在往日，會浮起多少玲琅的嘩笑啊！然而今日，也像夜一樣的沉默了。</p>
<p>九月的黃昏，江干楊起了浪花，窗外桐花如雲，夜裹，桐花悄悄地落着，落到夢裹，夜如此深沉，夢如此遠……</p>
<p>在耳鬢，妳也曾悄悄地告訴我那阿拉伯沙漠中行脚僧的故事，叫我厮守請夜，厮守着生命底燈火。</p>
<p>然而燈火燃亮的時候，妳却走了，桐花開白的季節裏，夜更長啊……</p>
<h3>小蘭花</h3>
<p>在陰霾晦澀的日子裏，在無盡止的流浪歲月中，在我背負着生命底十字架跨向十九度靑春底門檻時，我遇見了小蘭花……</p>
<p>在北國，在討賴河畔，那風沙漠野的邊緣，那長年爲冰雪封錮着的寂寞的地方，在那裹我遇到了小蘭花，是顚簸在在濤駭浪中的片帆，我尋獲了那靜謐溫馨的港灣。</p>
<p>小蘭花寂寞的開在草原的邊緣，淳樸的草原的氣息孳乳着她，孳乳着她那瑰麗的靑春的生命，在草原的懷抱裏，春風吹送來閃灼的金色的歲月，小蘭花開得更嬌艷了。</p>
<p>一年，春風吹來草原迷人的芳香，當我像吉卜賽人流浪到那裏時，我爲小蘭花沉郁的幽香所迷惑了，而小蘭花也陶醉在我憂鬱的琴弦裏。</p>
<p>小蘭花以她顫抖溫暖的手，撫摸着年靑流浪者一顆創傷的心，於是，我搖脫了一身的悲愁與創傷，常春風再度地輕叩着草原的心扉時，我已嬌健得如一匹小羊了。</p>
<p>薄霧輕籠着草原的黃昏，駝鈴搖落了一天。星斗的深夜，草原輕蕩起迷人的歌聲，憂鬱的琴弦講述着漫長流浪歲月中的故事，我看見小蘭花的眸子晶瑩的像遠天的銀星。</p>
<p>一年草原上掀起了風暴，流浪的歲月又開始了，挾起瘖啞了的豎琴，我悄然道聲珍重，離開那兒。</p>
<p>如今，小蘭花仍寂寞地開在草原的邊緣，開在我夢底邊緣……</p>
<h3>小名言</h3>

<p>每個人都可以做些令人高興的事。有的人走進屋子可以令人高興，有的人離開屋子可以令人高興。</p>

<h3>郵局的玩意兒</h3>
<p>— 玄石</p>
<p>在各種公用事業之中，最努力於推進業務的，郵局應該挨得到一個了。這裏也不必列舉它的工作，我們衹要平日在報紙上馬路上留神的話，就可得到這個印象：郵政局又有新玩意兒了。如今郵局宣布，又開始辦理代訂刋物的業務，我們因此深深感到，在目前這種困難情勢之下，有許多事情儘管不能絕對跳出那懇性的循環，却也未始沒有可爲。看瑯政以及其他若干公用事業的作爲，就可以相信這句話。</p>
<p>郵政跟其他許多事業一樣，是被抑價政策壓制着，落在物價競賽的後面。我們想像郵政的工作人員，生活一定很艱苦，逮不能與戰前相比。可是在艱苦的環境之中，他們却非但絲毫不懈怠，還能積極發展業務，以求多冬爲人民服務，而增加人民的方便，這種精神不能不令人佩服。我們深信他們在工作的推進中，不免遇到種種陣碍，然而障碍是障碍，他們却要舉行障碍賽跑，向前推進。我們也深信，如果沒有這些惡性循環的障碍，工作一定推進得格外順利，業務也一定擴展得格外廣大。可是我們更深信如果在這種降碍之下，畏縮不前，甚至以障碍爲藉口，不肯努力，那末障碍一定更多，業務要維持現狀也不容易，而結果便令人民格外感到不便，遭受麻煩。這中間的「一出一進」，相距是非常遙遠的。</p>
<p>筆者並不想對郵政當局有所歌頌，却覺得這種服務的精神値得提倡，值得各個不同崗位上的工作人員的效法。這不是粉飾太平，這是說在不太平的環境之中，我們澴得好好做一個人，好好做一點事。把一切推諉於局勢的惡性循環而攤開手堂向天，是於人於己都無聊的。</p>
<h3>幻想中的——定空浮泊機</h3>
<p>— 陳德馨</p>
<p>今年飛機交了惡運，東也跌下來，西也跌下來，豪貴的乘客，瞬息間斷肢折臂，爛額焦頭，從幸福的天堂墮入了悲慘的地獄。我是窮光蛋，無緣一搭飛機，可是時時刻刻有「閉門家裏坐，禍從天上來」的危險，這不是杞人之憂，早已有過好幾幕鏡頭顯現在大衆面前。我朝夕祈望着科學家，快些發明一種簡捷而安適的交通用具，</p>
<p>地球一刻不停地依着假設的地軸向東旋轉，二十四小時行三百六十度的路程，平均每小時行十五度，我國的天津和美國的華盛頓舊金山同在北緯三十九度左右，華盛頓距舊金山約四十五度，距天津約一百六十五度，則此時此刻華盛頓的空間三小時後爲舊金山的空間，十一小時後爲天津的空間，二十四小時後，這個空間，又為華盛頓所佔有。</p>
<p>因此我幻想將來或有一種浮泊於固定空間的飛機發現。牠不受地心吸力的牽動，沒有機件障碍的危險，不想惡劣氣候的　駕。除了南北路程仍須飛行外，東西間儘可離地後固定地浮泊在那個空間，乘客們安坐機中，憑窗俯視，欣賞那五花八門的大地上的一切情景。見了目的地，即行下降。環球一周，只要二十四小時已足。</p>
<p>到那時，東也一隻浮泊機，西也一隻浮機，鱗次梄比，蔽日遮天了。</p>
<p>末了，還得聲明，我是一個毫無科學常識的人，這篇東西，在現時代中，當然是荒謬之至，可是再隔若干年，或有幾許價值也未可知的，請閱者不要笑我在妄吧。</p>
<h3>游資之去路</h3>
<p>— 亞慕</p>
<p>據俞財長報告稱：政府發行美金公債，目的在吸收游資，安定金融，以達成平衡預算。欲求預算平衡，除依賴增稅等辦法外，發行公債，吸收游資，本係一種正當手段，多少年來，政府久應付諸實施。樓桐蓀氏之發言，亦大抵如此。或曰：賦稅已重，最好免加，爲作聯語一副如次：</p>
<p>時難年荒百業空，念爾國民難增負担，所失米償稅所得；</p>
<p>源開流節齊聲唱，擁吾政府發行金債，游去應知快游來。（游，游資也。）</p>
<h3>厚黑新詮</h3>
<p>— 但蒙</p>
<p>自從李宗善所著「厚黑學」問世，流佈得很快，都說是本不朽的書；爲了這册子不僅道出整個歷史上英雄們的眞性格和眞心賜，並啓示了最實用的人生哲學原理。</p>
<p>當然，他所講的只是關於如何成功顯赫的方法和技巧，「小則小善，大則大善。」其內容不外乎叙述臉厚心黑的人怎樣去攫取權勢，怎樣去把握富貴，怎樣去博求聲譽，是一份野心家的敎科書。在我輩，並不冀　到史籍中去掛名的小市民，原來似乎無須得研究厚與黑。</p>
<p>可是事實却不然，朋友甲君，本是一打油詩的唱和者，潦倒了，連木飯碗也找不到，於是在郵局門口擺拆字攤，兼欺詐愚夫愚婦們。親戚乙君，舊職業是報館記者，裁下來半年，備些錢辦了具照相生財到小碼頭去做流動攝影師，騙騙鄉下人，替照國民身份證相片，而丙敎授，在火學裹擔任過近十年講席，幾個小孩子還得送到惠寒小學去混免費，並且自己去搶佔附中的課程。</p>
<p>這些都說明了厚黑是我們環境中最低的生存策略，並不如李氏祗爲是謀求勝利者所必需，而甚至於運「安貧」亦不得不先考究厚黑了。</p>
<h3>人心大變</h3>
<p>— 果</p>
<p>再隔幾年以後的上海，電車上有一位男人讓座給一位女郎。她暈了過去。醒過來以後她謝謝他，他暈了過去。</p>
<h3>「棠棣之花」</h3>
<p>— 衛瀚</p>
<p>這是一首瑰奇壯麗的詩篇，一個動人心弦的故事。雖然在年代上，那已是遠隔着悠長歲月的「戰國」時期，可是在千年後的今日，仍深深的激起了我們情感上的共鳴。</p>
<p>周代末葉，羣雄割據，在動亂之中產生了許多游俠辯士一般傳奇的人物，更在這些人物身上，又形成了許多慷慨悲歌的史跡。「棠棣之花」的作者，就從這裏吸取了他寫作的題材。</p>
<p>歷史劇的編製，並非一件輕易工作，雖然歷史已經給我們預備好了現成的題材，因爲一個劇作不是刻版的紀錄，因此不能祗是機械的把史實重述一遍。而某一時代的歷史，又必然有着所以形成當時史實的時代背景，這不能出於劇作者的幻想，社撰；也不容硬給它去套上一件現代的外衣。所以在忠於史實之外，還需要一個藝術的剪裁手腕，把死的紀錄化爲有組織的活的故事。「棠棣之花」正是這樣一部成功的作品。</p>
<p>如果說「棠棣之花」劇本的編製是郭沫若氏的成功；那麼把它賦予以生命而在舞台上具體化起來，完滿的實現了它演出的工作，這又將是導演者應雲衛氏的功績。</p>
<p>原作的精華，在他精練的手法之下，得以發揚，展現在舞台之上。尤其在第一及第四幕中，那種充溢着情感，詩意的氣氛，都充份的表現了導演者的才能。</p>
<h3>再談筆名</h3>
<p>— 藍甘</p>
<p>人們寫文章，不用本名而另造一個筆名，普通大致有兩個原因：一是由於覺得直用本名或有不便之處。例如兒童讀物中有名的「阿麗思漫遊記」的作者，是一僭大學里的數學家，他因一段偶然的奇想所觸動，寫下了那本名著，但他自己並不知道：後來那捲原稿被他底朋友讀到了，大感驚奇，要拿去出版，他却以爲寫作那樣的東西和他的大學裏的數學敎授的身份是很不相稱的，於是他假託了另外一個筆名發表了，立刻受到讀者——特別是兒童贖者的熱烈歡迎，而且，想不到那篇「不便」和他本名聯在一起的東西使他在人類歷史上的聲名，遠較他在數學上的研究更爲人所知。</p>
<p>另一個使用筆名的原因，是爲了作者想藉此作一點紀念。這種例子也是很多的，譬如就有人說。魯迅先生的筆名中那個「魯」字，即爲紀念他母親之意云。</p>
<p>正和許多其他的事物一樣，筆名最初使用時到不是什麼壞事情；然而，後來經過一些投機取巧的市儈們一利用，用筆名的本意被沾汚了不少。據說文壇上就曾閙過一個這樣的笑話：有那麼一個人，自己用了兩個筆名，一個筆名寫創作，一個筆名寫批評；於是，一齣自拉自唱，自吹自捧的　戲演出來了；也終被人　穿了。——自然，這是頗令人作嘔的。</p>
<h3>詠戰鬼</h3>
<p>— 孫約翰</p>
<p>淸代滿洲之國宗石君有詠戰鬼一律，讀之令有心人淚下。辭云：「從戎沙漠覓封侯，未到將軍已斷頭，百戰雄風餘野哭，幾家噩夢人閨愁。陣雲冪冪　　遠，邊月凄凄故壘秋。馬革　誰收白骨？血痕狼藉染兜鍪。」首二句尤覺辛酸。唐王昌齡慣寫塞外邊地悽苦情况，見此篇，諒亦從旁歛手？</p>
<h3>自立為王</h3>
<p>— 季水</p>
<p>「人心不足蛇吞象」，這是一句俗語，意思是說人心是永遠不會有滿足的一天的。</p>
<p>眞的，乞丐們祗想有個足蔽風雨的處所，有三頓粗茶淡飯，就會心滿意足；但是，到了眞的得到的時候，他又想豐衣足食和安適的住所了。像我們辦等因奉此的人，在失「職」的時候，祗想有一個職務乙是，薪俸和階級，是不會顧及的，但是工作了一個時間，便又開始對職位和薪俸要表示不滿了。</p>
<p>所以歷史上有秦皇漢武之流，做了皇帝，便更要做神仙了。民國以來，如袁世凱之流，已經是君臨全國的大總統了，還不滿足，必定要穿起「大龍拖」，使人民對他高呼「萬歲」，他才覺得朕是「天下」了。</p>
<p>在平日，我和朋友們談到這些歷史上的陳跡，我每以時代的關係，曲爲他們解釋。我說：「要是在現在，就不會有這些事的。」</p>
<p>但佛朗哥竟自己封謚爲「元首」了。而且在彿朗哥「未喪失其能力以前，決不另立國王」。這表示歷史的反動，還是時代的轉向呢？</p>

<p>— 聽松</p>
<p>鄭五爲相，時事可知，所謂歇後語也。今之從政者，視鄭五何如乎？余年十三時，見伯兄有友來札，滿紙皆論物價，其中有相君之背一語，余膛目不解其義。詢之伯兄，伯兄曰：子盍翻閱史記韓信傳，當知此語之妙也。蓋信傳中，蒯通說韓信反漢高曰：「相君之背，貴不可言。」余深訝此札，詞甚傖俗，何以忽有此極雅之歇後語，余今年七十三矣，事已一周甲，而此語尚深印腦際不能忘，文字之魔力大矣哉。前日於友人聚餐席上，偶談及此事，有友忽曰：子近善談聯話，亦知曾湘鄉，有一歇後聯語，妙不可言乎？余曰：未之前聞。友乃述其聯日：「歸去來兮，夜月樓臺花蕚影；行不得也，楚天風雨鷓鴣聲。」此聯蓋文正公輓其弟殉三河之難者，聯中除花蕚二字，用唐明皇花藝樓故事，涉及兄弟外，全體超妙。而行不得也哥哥一語。人所共知，用以歇後，令人雊誦一過，覺魂兮歸來，夜月楚天，鳥聲花影，友于至性，充塞行　，儼若此中有人，呼之欲出，非文正大手筆，焉能繪影繪聲，如此層層俱到乎？</p>

<h3>危城記</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「你……你也不……明白……我的痛苦……嗎？」三四分鐘之後，低着頭竭力在忍住哭泣的金愛麗才用極低的聲音，迸出了這句斷續的話語。</p>
<p>這可把老祝感動了，他詫愕地側過頭去，看定了顏色變得很蒼白的金愛麗。</p>
<p>「別這樣難受！算我說錯了，好不好？」</p>
<p>女子用幽怨的眼光向他瞥視了一下。</p>
<p>「你以爲老　還不如徐胖子跟小沈嗎？」她緩過了一口氣，低聲地問，頭仍然垂着。</p>
<p>老說看了她那樣可憐的神氣，心裹也有些惻然，但又忍不住想笑。</p>
<p>「他待你還好嗎？」他用另一句問話作爲答覆。</p>
<p>「還不差老祝！」她忽然又興奮了一些，仰着臉，脈脈地　定了他。「他說到了貴陽就正式跟我結婚，你想他不會騙我嗎？」</p>
<p>「這個我當然不能給他保證，可是我也不敢胡說。」他做了個手勢，止住了正想插言的金愛麗。「總之，你不必想得太遠！現在你先告訴我，他究竟給了你多少錢？」</p>
<p>提到這一點，金愛麗的內心上實在是覺得很安慰的。</p>
<p>「他給了我一個鑽戒。」她舉起右手一揚，但老祝並沒有向那顆亮晶晶的東西看。「還有五百元美鈔。」</p>
<p>老祝點點頭，又取起豆漿來喝着。</p>
<p>「到了貴陽，他答應再給我一百萬塊錢，弄兩間屋子。」她對老說倒眞是無話不談，而老說還是默然；於是她感到窘了。「老祝！你怎麼不開口。告訴我啊！你看他會不會再像小沈一樣？」</p>
<p>「你自己看他怎麼樣？」老說放下了玻璃杯，含着笑反問。</p>
<p>「他是個老頭兒，應該總比年輕人老實一些。」金愛麗的眼光倒很足以代表一般的舞女。「從前我在香港的時候，也知道他，不過那時候他還沒有錢，現在……」</p>
<p>「現在他太有錢了！是不是？愛麗。」祝兆年笑警說：「不過，你得注意，有錢的老頭兒也並不比年輕人安分！况且你該明白，他的錢是從那兒來的？公家的車子，他拿去大做生意。不錯，我們這個國家一切都是亂的，暫且也許不會鬧穿，但將來誰能保這個險呢？所以，愛麗，你的眼光不必放得太遠。借這個機會，弄他幾個錢，逃一次舒舒服服的難。不好嗎？」（三七）</p>

<h3>Street Fighting Erupts in Suide; Northern Shaanxi Situation Expected to Clear Soon; Zhu and Mao Have Crossed the River and Arrived in Lin County, Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] (1) The Northern Shaanxi campaign has reached its climax. National troops, having bypassed Jiulishan, entered Da Hui Ping, south of Suide, on the evening of the 4th. After capturing Huyukou, east of Suide, on the morning of the 3rd, they finally broke into Suide City at 10:00 AM. Street fighting was fierce, and it is reported that the entire city was completely occupied by 5:00 PM. Simultaneously, National troops who captured Laoya Pass are advancing north along the Yellow River, heading directly for Wubao, a Yellow River crossing point. On the 5th, they continued to capture strongholds such as Zhenkou, Jieshou, and Bojiachuan, effectively locking off the retreat of the Communist forces in Northern Shaanxi. Furthermore, National troops moving south from Yulin have bypassed Zhenchuan and are engaged in fierce battles with Communist forces at the strategic Wanfodong pass, 15 li north of Mizhi. A junction of the northern and southern forces is expected soon. (2) The Communist forces in Northern Shaanxi are gradually being encircled by the National troops. The two major Yellow River crossing points, Wubao and Jiaxian, which are routes to Shanxi, have been blocked. The Communist forces now only occupy five counties: Mizhi, Tongshan, Jingbian, Jiaxian, and Wubao.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 5th] Since the National troops captured Wayao Fort, the second base of the Communist forces in Northern Shaanxi, the main force of the Communist army has been completely defeated. The remaining Communist forces are now scattered in the mountainous areas southwest of Suide, in a state of panic and disarray, avoiding engagement. Observers suggest that the situation in Northern Shaanxi should be completely cleared up in the short term.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 6th] After the recapture of Anding, National troops are currently mopping up the remaining Communist forces and advancing northwest and due north.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 5th] National troops who recovered Dingbian, after achieving brilliant victories, are continuing to advance towards Anbian. Observing the current military situation, the National troops advancing east from Dingbian and north from Bao'an should soon converge. The complete elimination of the Communist forces in Northern Shaanxi is expected in the near future.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The transportation in Northern Shaanxi was previously damaged by the Communist forces, and many landmines were buried. Recently, the provincial government raised funds for emergency repairs, and most of the landmines have been cleared. Major transportation routes are now unobstructed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 6th] It is reported that Guo Baoshan, the Communist commander killed in Dingbian, was the commander of the Sanbian Garrison. Wang Zhenchuan, the head of the 8th Regiment of the Communist Police, was captured alive.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Taiyuan News: (1) After the Communist forces in Northern Shaanxi fled into Shanxi, the situation in Shanxi is becoming increasingly serious. Director Yan told reporters that if the Communist forces invade, he is determined to strike a heavy blow. He personally has confidence in victory. Taiyuan is currently mobilizing 5,000 people from the industrial and commercial sectors daily to actively construct city defense works. (2) It is confirmed that Zhu and Mao crossed the river into Shanxi on the 29th of last month, arriving in Lin County, intending to establish a new base in northwestern Shanxi.</p>
<p>[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 5th] The Northern Shaanxi war has entered a decisive stage. Although the Communist forces have fled towards northwestern Shanxi, they have not yet engaged in a large-scale crossing of the river. Only a dozen boats were anchored on the Wubao riverbank on the 5th. Furthermore, at 2:00 PM on the 5th, a portion of the Communist forces launched a fierce attack on National troops in Gujiaohe (80 li northwest of Taiyuan). Fierce fighting is still ongoing. On the 2nd, over 2,000 Communist troops fled north from Fushan to Zihongzhen (southeast of Qixian). The Communist forces began blockading the area around Fancun in Taigu on the 4th, strictly prohibiting people from passing through. Additionally, on the 3rd, the Communist forces attacked Yicheng and Jiangxian from the west of the Fen River, while another force opened up Wanhucun to contain the main force of the National troops in Quwo, deploying heavy troops southwest of Wangfeng Xia Zhuang to attack Jiangxian, with fierce fighting in the suburbs of Yicheng lasting all night on the evening of the 3rd.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The Communist forces in Southern Shanxi have launched another offensive, surrounding Houma, Quwo, Yicheng, and other places. Their aim seems to be to control Southern Shanxi in order to connect western and eastern Shanxi. On the 3rd, Chen Jitong led Communist forces to form an encirclement around Yicheng, Quwo, and Jiangxian. On the evening of the 4th, a brigade infiltrated and probed Houma, engaging in fierce fighting with National troops. Another force approached Quwo, and there was also contact in Yicheng.</p>
<h3>National Army in Arc Encirclement of Mountainous Areas; Shandong War Situation Increasingly Unfolding; Communist Army Suffers Losses and Adopts Mobile Warfare</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 6th] The war situation in Shandong Province is increasingly unfolding. The various army corps of the National Army, in an arc encirclement from north of Linting to east of Tai'an, are advancing from southwest to northeast, heading directly for the Yimeng Mountains and the Culai Mountains, gradually unfolding a major battle. The Communist army is attempting to defend to the death, with Communist forces from various locations concentrating in the mountainous areas. The main force of the Communist forces in the central and western sections of the Jiaoji Railway has mostly moved south to the mountainous areas to participate in the battle, leaving only a small number of troops to defend. Strongholds such as Zhangdian, Zhoucun, and Mingshui are now garrisoned by local militia, with no regular troops. The main force of the Communist forces around Jinan has also mostly withdrawn, but a considerable number remains, attempting to threaten Jinan. National troops have been conducting guerrilla warfare around Jinan for days, achieving many gains. The Communist forces are defeated whenever they engage. National troops in Tai'an have completely recovered the surrounding strongholds, political work is underway, and local order has been restored. Large units of the National Army are advancing towards the Culai Mountains and the Laiwu and Xintai areas.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 6th] The mopping-up operation by the National Army in the mountainous areas of Southern Shandong has been successfully completed today. The National Army from the Jinpu Railway eastward, Feixian westward, and Sishui southward have converged today. The more than 20,000 Communist forces, including the New 7th Division, New 8th Division, and remnants of Zhang Guangzhong's forces from the Southern Shandong Military Region, have been completely defeated. On the 5th, the National Army continued to recover Liangqiu Ancient City, Lujia Mountain, and Tuanshan, killing and wounding over 500 Communist soldiers and capturing over 100.</p>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch, 5th] The Communist forces in Shandong have switched to mobile warfare. Their army originally numbered over 400,000 men. After losses in the battle in Northern Jiangsu and part of Liu Bocheng's forces fleeing to Northern Henan, the current total is 330,000 to 350,000 men. The Shandong situation has entered a new stage, and a main force battle will soon unfold to eliminate them. Currently, in the area around Jinan to Zhangdian, west of Boshan, south of Yucheng, and north of Tai'an, the Communist forces have no special movements, only occasional small encounters. There are no regular Communist forces in the Mingshui, Zhangqiu, and Jinan areas, as well as in the Changqing and Feicheng areas west of the Jinpu Railway. North of Pucheng on the north bank of the Yellow River, there is the 6th Brigade of the Communist Police. The main force of the Communist forces around Qingdao, the 5th and 6th Divisions of the Jie Army and the 3rd Brigade of the Police, is still gathered in the Pingdu and Jiaoxian areas. Their Jiaodong Military Region troops are in the Jimo area, with many divisions and combat preparations.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 6th] The remnants of Jin Shaoshan's Communist forces in Eastern Henan, numbering over 4,000 men, attacked Milling on the evening of the 3rd, engaging in a fierce battle with the defending troops for a day and night. The Communist forces were unable to withstand the attack and fled south.</p>
<p>[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 6th] The remnants of Zhang Taisheng's Communist forces, numbering over 4,000 men, fled to Handao Kou and Xiaowang Shan on the border of Xiaoxian and Yongcheng on the afternoon of the 5th, attempting to attack Xiaoxian.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th] The remnants of Liu Bocheng's 1st and 7th Columns of the Communist forces continued to retreat northeast through the Laoanzhen area west of Fengqiu and Changyuan on the 5th. Their 1st Brigade also retreated towards that direction from Yanjin. The remnants of their 2nd Column, Independent 4th Brigade, and New 5th Brigade fled northeast after retreating across the Wei River.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Outside Rongcheng; National Army Flanking Reinforcements</h3>
<p>[Our Baoding Dispatch, 6th] The Communist forces on the eastern side of the Ping-Bao section are containing the progress of the National Army in the Ping-Jin-Bao triangle area, attempting to secure the central area of the Ping-Han and Jin-Pu lines. On the morning of the 5th, they gathered a force of two brigades and attempted to attack Rongcheng County. The defending force of 1,000 men has been engaged in battle for a day and night, with fierce fighting. On the morning of the 6th, a unit of the National Army from Xushui made a flanking maneuver to reinforce the north, encountering over 1,000 Communist troops in the area 15 li east of the city, engaging in fierce fighting. National troops from Xincheng have also been dispatched south to provide reinforcements, and the siege of the city is expected to be lifted soon. Another report: the Communist forces that were repelled east of Baoding yesterday are being pursued by the National Army. On the morning of the 6th, 2,000 Communist troops were surrounded near Zangcun, 50 li east of Baoding. The sound of artillery fire shook the provincial capital, and the Communist forces are collapsing.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The Gucheng railway station on the northern section of the Ping-Han line was suddenly attacked by over 4,000 Communist troops last night, engaging in fierce fighting with the defending troops in the area two kilometers west of the station. They were repelled by the morning of the 6th. Passenger trains on the Ping-Bao line are operating as usual on the 6th. The Communist forces are still active in the rural areas outside the station. Baoding dispatched troops this morning to reinforce the defense of Gucheng.</p>
<h3>Hu Zongnan in Yan'an; Receives Chinese and Foreign Journalists; Hopes to Call for Increased Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yan'an, 5th] Commander Hu Zongnan hosted a banquet at 7:00 PM on the 5th in the reception hall of the former Communist headquarters for all members of the Beijing-Shanghai Chinese and foreign journalist corps.

<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of National Defense has ordered the Tanggu military authorities to investigate the incident of Communist forces attacking the American arms depot.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] Regarding the recent Tanggu incident, in which five US Marines were killed and sixteen wounded, officials here said that they are currently unable to provide any detailed report. Before issuing a statement, the US authorities are awaiting a formal report from their representatives in China. It is expected to be received within two or three days.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tianjin, 6th] One of the three US Marines severely wounded in the Communist attack in Xinhe has been rescued from danger today and is expected to survive. The other eleven have minor injuries and are responding well to treatment. The US Marine Corps authorities have so far not allowed reporters to speak to the injured. A battalion of the National Army arrived in Xinhe four hours after the fighting had stopped and is currently pursuing the Communist forces. However, it is generally believed that most of the Communist forces have escaped. Many officers of the Second Army of the National Army went to Xinhe today to investigate the matter.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 6th] "The New York Times" and "The Herald Tribune" continued to carry the news of the attack on the American arms depot near Tanggu for the second day today, but both newspapers did not certify the report. All news agencies confirmed that the attackers were Chinese Communist elements.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 6th] The First Marine Division Headquarters stationed in Tianjin reported that over 300 Chinese people who raided the First Division arms depot in Xinhe, five miles northwest of Tanggu, on the morning of the 5th were indeed organized and trained Communist forces. They not only advanced and retreated based on military bugles and whistles, but also used Japanese automatic weapons and grenades. During the attack, they were divided into four teams, three teams attacked, and one team ambushed on the roadside between Tanggu and Xinhe to prevent reinforcements. In the first few minutes of contact, the 1st Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the Marine Corps stationed in Xinhe lost five men, two guards and three people who were assisting the guards at the time. After the contact began, the soldiers of the 1st Battalion launched a fierce counterattack against the Communist forces with a much smaller number of men. The headquarters of the 1st Battalion stationed in Zenggu received the report and immediately sent reinforcements. Although the armored vehicles encountered some resistance on the way, they finally arrived in Xinhe after fighting back. Four hours later, the Communist forces were repelled. On the morning of the 5th, aircraft of the First Battalion of the First Division stationed in Tianjin took off one after another to pursue them until about 1:00 PM, when they withdrew. Throughout the entire contact, in addition to the five American soldiers killed, sixteen were injured, two of whom are still in critical condition. The Communist forces suffered heavy casualties in addition to leaving six corpses. After the incident, the aircraft of the First Division reconnoitered the Communist forces' positions and retreat lines and saw a large number of stretchers and bloodstains in many places. Two American ammunition depots exploded, and other losses were minimal.</p>

<h3>Receiving Lüda Becomes Increasingly Concrete; Chinese and Soviet Generals Hold Talks; Soviet Side Agrees to Let Us Receive Wazi Dian First</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 6th] The issue of receiving Lüda is becoming increasingly concrete. The Soviet military commander in Lüda specially invited our frontline commander Colonel Zhou Pu to hold talks in Pulandian at 11:00 AM on the 6th. In addition to dispatching senior staff officer Zhan Shi to participate, the Command Headquarters also sent two staff members. Zhan will return to Qing Dynasty (瀋陽) within the day.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The meeting between Chinese and Soviet generals in Pulandian on the afternoon of the 6th is the precursor to our receipt of Lüda. The extent to which both sides respect the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship can be conceived from this. Our side will express our firm position to the Soviet commander and request that the Soviet side clearly indicate the methods for expelling the illegal armed forces in the Lüda area, otherwise the National Army will restore political power in Lüda through action. The people involved in our meeting with the Soviets returned north on the night of the 6th and stayed overnight in Wafangdian. Liao Yaoxiang is scheduled to arrive in Shenyang by train on the night of the 6th to report on the meeting between the frontline Chinese and Soviet generals in Wafangdian. Furthermore, the telephone poles and lines between Pulandian and Shihe have been jointly repaired by China and the Soviet Union and are now connected. This line, approximately 15 kilometers long, will greatly improve the military liaison and emotional relationship between China and the Soviet Union in the future.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] During the Sino-Soviet talks in Pulandian on the 6th, the Soviet side agreed to let us receive Wazi Dian first. Wazi Dian is located southeast of Pulandian and is the water source for Lüda. The Soviet side requested that we recover and be responsible for protecting it.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] It is believed here that it would be beneficial and convenient for both sides if the frontline troops of China and the Soviet Union each sent a military team to be stationed in the other's headquarters regarding the military affairs of the Lüda area.</p>
<h3>Xu Kan Talks About the Recent Situation in the Northeast; All of Liaoning Province Except Lushun Has Been Received; The Strength of the National Army is Very Strong and Does Not Allow Communist Army Raids</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Xu Kan, Chairman of Liaoning Province, arrived in Beijing from Shenyang on March 21 to attend the Third Plenary Session. After the meeting, he came to Shanghai on the 4th. Reporters paid a special visit last night and asked about the recent situation in the Northeast. According to him: Because Liaoning Province was received earlier, there are no security problems today. All the provinces have been recovered except for the city of Lushun.</p>
<p>There are more than 20 newspapers in Liaoning Province, and the ones with larger sales volumes include Central, Peace, Progress, Northeast Pioneer, Northeast Minbao, Commercial Daily, Sino-Soviet Daily, Xinbao, Shenyang Daily, and Justice News. The daily sales volume is over 10,000 copies. In addition, there are many news agencies.</p>
<p>The recovered area of ​​the Northeast accounts for more than two-fifths of the total area. The important political, economic, and cultural centers are all within the recovered area. The population accounts for more than two-thirds of the total population of the Northeast. Transportation has been restored, but there is a shortage of railway cars. More than 600,000 Japanese prisoners are being sent back, and there is no underground power of Japan in the Northeast. The current difficulty felt in the Northeast is still in terms of finance, which is the same for the whole country, not a special situation in the Northeast. In terms of the supply of materials, there is no shortage of daily necessities produced locally. Those imported from other places have transportation difficulties. However, due to the use of Yingkou; Huludao port, it is much more convenient than a year ago. The currency currently used in the Northeast is still mainly circulation coupons, and prices have risen about tenfold compared to the initial reception.</p>
<p>About seven-tenths of the industrial equipment in the Northeast was looted. The remaining equipment is being actively used. However, because it is not easy to replenish Japanese goods machines and there is a lack of technicians, this work has not yet been completed. Currently, the heavy industry in the Northeast is operated by the National Resources Commission, and other light industries are managed by the Northeast Production Administration of the Xingyuan Command Headquarters.</p>
<p>The strength of the National Army in the Northeast is very strong and it does not allow the Communist Army to raid. Self-defense forces of the people have been organized in Liaoning Province to protect railways and rural villages.</p>
<p>Regarding the receipt of Lüda, Xu declined to express his opinion, but believed that it would take longer to receive it politically and less time to receive it militarily. There are not many large-scale Communist forces, and there will not be a large-scale battle. Xu also said: While in Beijing, he paid a visit to the President and made some requests in all aspects. Chairman Xu is unlikely to be there for a day or two due to traffic conditions.</p>

<h3>Plan to Designate Taihu Lake as a Special Administrative Region: Suzhou County Government Submits Two Suggestions to Improve Transportation and Develop Production</h3>
<p>[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 6th] The case of designating Taihu Lake as a special administrative region and establishing an administrative bureau was previously approved by Chairman Chiang to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for joint discussion by relevant ministries and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for reporting and approval. It has now been decided that the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces should first solicit the opinions of the counties along the lake and report them for consideration and deliberation. Recently, the Suzhou County Government has submitted its opinions on transportation and production, which are recorded as follows: (1) Transportation: The current water and land transportation of Taihu Lake relies solely on shipping, which is very inconvenient. It is proposed that the existing road from Suzhou to Fuxiao be extended to Qingkou, and two lines be built through Hengjing to Dianqian. On Xishan Island, a county road will be built from Houbao through Zhili to Tangli, with a total length of approximately 30 kilometers. Ferry services will be established in Houbao, Zhenxia, and Xukou in Dongshan, which will greatly facilitate transportation. (2) Production: There are many beaches along the coast of Taihu Lake, covering a vast area. It is proposed to develop them into fish ponds, plant mulberry trees and various flowers and trees, and establish seedling nurseries and forest farms in Dongshan and Xishan to improve planting for the benefit of the country and the people.</p>
<h3>7th Annual Meeting of the Land Administration Society: Chairman Chiang Grants Special Instruction</h3>

The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. The chairman's instructions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman Xiao Zheng of the Chinese Land Administration Society and all comrades of the 7th annual meeting,</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood contains the most profound and clear instructions for solving the land problem. The improvement of people's livelihood and the enrichment of national defense must follow this path. However, due to the many difficulties faced by the country in the past twenty years, even with excellent policies, the implementation of government orders has not achieved the expected results. In land administration, important tasks such as land registration, land price declaration, and agricultural output distribution have not yet been initiated. We must make double efforts to lay the foundation for the great cause of national construction, which is extremely urgent. In particular, our country has a vast territory, and the conditions of urban land to rural land, and in the east, west, south, and north, are mutually different and intricately complex. If we want to implement our party's land policy thoroughly to achieve the effect of utilizing the land to its full potential for the benefit of the people, then all handling methods must have good regulations that adapt to local conditions. This also relies on our people's careful consideration, comprehensive and meticulous management, and compromise to achieve success. Your society has a long history and gathers extensive knowledge in one place. It is hoped that this annual meeting will focus on current needs, carefully deliberate, and express excellent plans to serve as a reference for land administration measures and to benefit the progress of people's livelihood construction. This is my sincere hope.</p>

Since February, he has started manufacturing opium, having already produced it four times, with a total value of over 30 million yuan in current currency. Most of it was transported to Andong for sale. Relevant authorities are still investigating whether they are related to the opium manufacturers previously cracked down in Changchun.</p>
<h3>To Implement Constitutional Government, the People Must Have a Spirit of Law Abiding: Minister Peng Gave a Broadcast Speech in Shanghai Yesterday at the Invitation of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei, at the invitation of this newspaper, broadcast a speech on China Freedom Radio Station at 6:00 PM yesterday, with the theme "To Implement Constitutional Government, the People Must Have a Spirit of Law Abiding." The main points of Minister Peng's speech are as follows: "This year is the beginning of the implementation of constitutional government. The Kuomintang will end its period of political tutelage and return power to the people. However, when the people begin to participate in politics, first, they should be prepared to accept constitutional government; second, they should have the training and experience to exercise political power; and third, they should have a spirit of public service and law abiding. For example, if we demand freedom, we should not infringe upon the freedom of others. Everyone must abide by the law and exercise self-control in order to be impartial and selfless and promote unity and unification. Otherwise, if 400 million people abuse freedom, wouldn't it be terrible? Everyone must understand the meaning of law abiding and self-control. To be more specific, those in government should, of course, abide by the law and not abuse their power, but ordinary people must also abide by the law and cannot act recklessly and irresponsibly. For example, those who run newspapers cannot express opinions that violate the interests of the nation and the people or violate the rights and interests of the people simply to satisfy personal desires. This means that everyone should not only seek their own interests, but must take the interests of the whole as their own. We can see proof of this by looking at other countries. Why has constitutional government succeeded in Britain and the United States? The reason is that from the government to the people, they all have a spirit of public service and law abiding. Their newspaper industry is developed, but newspapers rarely have irresponsible remarks and speak based on facts, not personal emotions. Because their newspaper people can manage themselves, the government does not need to manage them. This highly developed spirit of law abiding and self-government is the only condition for the success of constitutional government in Britain and the United States. Looking at why Germany and Japan failed? This is because the general public in Germany and Japan lacked training in democratic politics and did not have the habit of law abiding, which led to the indulgence of a small number of people's ambitions, which eventually led to the emergence of absurd aggressive ideas, and the people followed blindly, which ultimately led to the tragic defeat of today. The strength of Germany and Japan, whether politically or economically, cannot be denied. But in a blink of an eye, they were completely defeated, and this was due to the people's lack of law abiding. The success of constitutional government in Britain and the United States and the failure of Germany and Japan are due to law abiding and the inability to abide by the law. It must be known that the implementation of constitutional government is by no means an easy task. It requires the knowledge and conduct of constitutionalism of all the people in order to succeed. Otherwise, it is likely to lead to the opposite result. The ancients said: The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual. This means that everyone has a responsibility for national politics, and with responsibility comes rights. What I am contributing to you today is the eight characters "The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual."</p>

<h3>America's Responsibility for World Peace</h3>
<p>On the anniversary of the birth of the late American President Thomas Jefferson, President Truman delivered a speech at the Democratic Party Convention, emphatically declaring: the United States cannot shirk its responsibility for creating world peace, and therefore bears the responsibility of assisting the freedom of peoples in all nations who are in danger. He also stated, "In order to shoulder this responsibility, the United States must maintain sufficient military strength to convince all nations that the United States is determined to act in accordance with its responsibilities; the United States must not only be strong, but also have a sound economic and financial situation." Although this important speech did not directly mention the plan to aid Greece and Turkey, the diplomatic policy it elaborated is a powerful interpretation of its aid plan to Greece and Turkey, making the American people deeply feel that the responsibility of the United States for world peace is indeed too important; if this glorious and lofty mission is to be accomplished, it is necessary to fully exert its political wisdom.</p>
<p>President Truman delivered a speech to a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives on the 12th of last month, requesting Congress to allocate $400 million to aid Greece and Turkey, and to assist the revival of Greece and Turkey in other ways, in order to resist external pressure; nearly four weeks have passed since then, and although American public opinion is extremely complex regarding President Truman's aid plan to Greece and Turkey, there is also a common point that is, everyone unanimously believes that it is indeed necessary to aid Greece and Turkey. Therefore, when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee discussed this plan on the 3rd of this month, it unanimously passed the President's proposed aid plan to Greece and Turkey, and also passed the amendment proposed by the committee chairman, Vandenberg. It is heard that the State Department has also expressed its agreement to this amendment, so the Senate will begin to discuss this aid plan to Greece and Turkey when it meets tomorrow.</p>
<p>America's active assistance to Greece and Turkey is not only a clearer indication of American foreign policy, but also a prelude to the increasingly subtle relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, after President Truman announced this plan, it shocked almost the entire world, and its impact on Moscow was indeed significant, even exceeding the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference being held in Moscow. Even the most outspoken American congressmen initially had to adopt a cautious attitude towards this plan, which could influence the world situation, and did not dare to comment on it arbitrarily. However, in the past three or four weeks, American public opinion has clarified and fully understood the current world situation, deeply feeling the necessity for the United States to provide assistance to Greece and Turkey. Everyone believes that this plan will not only not cause a new war, but will also be sufficient to consolidate the foundation of world peace. The only question is how to use political wisdom!</p>
<p>Legally speaking, the aid plan to Greece and Turkey proposed by President Truman is drafted in accordance with the United Nations Charter, and it is clearly stipulated in its preamble that if the United Nations agency is capable of assisting Greece and Turkey, then the United States must stop implementing its aid plan to Greece and Turkey; at the same time, the amendment proposed by Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has also been passed by the Foreign Relations Committee, and the State Department has no objection to this. This amendment also clearly stipulates that the United States must stop implementing the aid plan to Greece and Turkey in the following three situations: (1) If the United Nations agency, through a resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly or the Security Council, is capable of implementing the aid plan to Greece and Turkey on its own; (2) If the majority of the people of Greece and Turkey request the United States to stop providing assistance; (3) If the President of the United States believes that the basic objectives of this aid plan to Greece and Turkey cannot be achieved. From this, it can be seen that the American aid plan to Greece and Turkey is not immutable and must be implemented. Let us look again at the documents published by the US State Department in response to questions from various senators, of which two points are most worthy of our attention: (1) The United States does not want to use aid to Greece and Turkey as a means to become a joint guardian of the Turkish Straits: (2) The American aid plan to Greece and Turkey cannot be regarded as an attempt by the United States to encircle the Soviet Union or other countries.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, it is completely different: the Soviet Union not only harbors territorial claims against Turkey, but has also long wanted to meddle in the Turkish Straits, which is a well-known fact; it is also a well-known fact that Turkey is under external pressure and is in a state of anxiety all day long. What country does President Truman refer to when he says that the United States will assist Turkey in resisting its external pressure? It is even more obvious. As for the situation in Greece, Greece is one of the Balkan countries, how can the Soviet Union care that it is outside its circle! From the end of the war until now, it has been in the flames of civil war at all times. Although there are British troops stationed there to assist the Greek government in maintaining order and security; however, the disturbances of armed guerrillas have continued unabated, and it has never been possible to eliminate them, and northern Greece has become another world; does the Greek civil war have an international background? It is already self-evident! In successive international conferences, diplomats from Britain and the Soviet Union have engaged in countless fierce verbal battles over the Greek issue. The Soviet Union has repeatedly attacked Britain for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries because of the presence of British troops in Greece. What is its intention? The Soviet Union has long regarded the Balkan Peninsula as its security zone, and Greece is the only country not behind its "Iron Curtain." How can the Soviet Union stand idly by? Now Britain feels overwhelmed and has to withdraw from Greece. But after Britain withdraws from Greece, if the United States does not take its place in Greece, then the power that will follow will naturally be the Soviet Union's. Therefore, no matter how the United States explains President Truman's aid plan to Greece and Turkey, the Soviet Union will ultimately feel that it is like a thorn in its side! This is also an inevitable truth.</p>
<p>Standing in the position of a third party, we calmly observe the development of the international situation, and we deeply know that the opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union has become increasingly acute! For the sake of the future of world peace, it is indeed worthy of our concern. After the war, the United States and the Soviet Union, having learned this lesson of blood, both felt the horror of war and the loveliness of peace: but because of different ideas and conflicts of actual interests, they created a situation of opposition between the two countries. We study the crux of the problem and find that it is due to the mutual suspicion between the two countries that they cannot trust and understand each other. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it always feels that the United States is threatening and containing the Soviet Union everywhere with its secret of atomic energy and the advantage of its monetary diplomacy, so that the Soviet Union has to expand its "security circle" in order to seek its own self-protection. As for the United States, it always feels that the Soviet Union is expanding its power, whether in Europe or in the Far East, it is like mercury leaking to the ground, entering every pore. Therefore, in order to prevent problems before they happen, it has to keep the secret of atomic energy, it has to maintain military bases in various parts of the world, and it has to lend huge sums of money to countries that feel external pressure to help them develop so that they can resist resolutely. The mutual suspicion of both sides is both cause and effect, and mutual stimulation has become incompatible like ice and charcoal. Even on any matter, the views of the United States and the Soviet Union are always different. For example, regarding the view of peace, if it is not the peace led by the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union always feels that this is not true peace; similarly, in the United States, if it is not the peace under the protection of the United States, it is not true peace. Furthermore, Soviet-style democracy? And American-style democracy are even more different. Therefore, although the United States and the Soviet Union both want to achieve peace and democracy, the ideals they hold and the methods they should take are completely different. At the Foreign Ministers Conference still being held in Moscow today, although the four powers are completely in agreement in principle on the German issue, they disagree as soon as they touch the core. This is an excellent proof.</p>
<p>In short, we fully agree with President Truman's statement that the United States has a responsibility to create world peace; but what kind of method should be adopted in order to fulfill its mission to the world and all mankind; especially for the Soviet Union, what kind of political wisdom should the United States use to eliminate the suspicion between the United States and the Soviet Union invisibly, it seems that there is still a need for consideration.</p>

<h3>Preventing Aggression and Safeguarding the Freedom of All Nations: America Decides to Adopt a Positive Stance. President Truman Delivers a Speech Reaffirming His Belief That to Avoid War, the Roots of Conflict Must Be Eradicated</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] President Truman delivered a speech at the Democratic Party founder Thomas Jefferson Memorial Day banquet today, strongly stating that the United States must adopt a positive stance to deal with all forms of aggression, and must maintain its own economic strength. Americans must assist the general public whose freedom is threatened by foreign forces. The President specifically pointed out two methods: secret infiltration and open military aggression. On the domestic front, the President said that the Republican Party's economic measures in Congress, such as demanding immediate tax cuts, will lead to disaster. He has no plans for the next election. When the President mentioned "In order to support the United Nations, we should supplement its activities when necessary," he was obviously referring to his plan to aid Greece and Turkey. It is said that "Aiding free countries to maintain freedom, we can strengthen the strength of the United Nations organization in completing the role of the United Nations organization. We must adopt a positive stance. It is not enough to just say that we do not want war. At this moment, we must eradicate any beginning of conflict to prevent its threat from spreading to the whole world. We have seen in the past that strong countries use force to invade weak countries and solve problems with bloodshed. We already know the result. The duty of the United States is to defend the United Nations organization. The United Nations organization must extinguish the flames in any place and not hesitate to use international guards to prevent armed conflict." The President added that the evolution of the situation makes it necessary for the United States to lead the world, regardless of the difficulty of the task and the magnitude of the cost. The people of our country are the ones who contributed figures such as Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt to the world. The people of our country not only cherish freedom, but also are willing to protect it with their lives when necessary. We also recognize the right of other countries and peoples to share this freedom.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] In the United States Senate, the accusations against President Truman's aid plan to Greece and Turkey are divided into two factions: one faction is determined to oppose it to the end, and the other faction is prepared to accept it when there is no other way. Members of the opposition faction said that they will fight on the Senate floor this week and strive to eliminate aid to Turkey, and limit aid to Greece to relief trade. At the same time, the State Department also issued a 46-page printed document answering 111 questions raised by members of Congress, which can help those who support the aid plan. The answer strongly stated that aid to Greece and Turkey does not pose any direct threat to the legitimate interests of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union cannot interpret this aid as an unfriendly act and use it as an excuse for retaliation. The greatest threat to the stability of Greece is the attempt of 13,000 guerrillas to overthrow the current government. Although most of these guerrillas are not communists, their leaders are mostly communists and promote communist ideas, so they must be prevented. As for Turkey, the country was a neutral country that was favorable to the Allies during the war. Turkey has assisted the Allies in many ways, such as allowing Allied technicians to enter the country, allowing the Allies to set up ammunition supply depots in its territory, and facilitating the passage of Allied wounded soldiers and prisoners of war, so it is also worthy of assistance.</p>
<h3>The US Joint Chiefs of Staff Announces the Completion of the Defensive War Plan with Emphasis on the Pacific</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Army officials announced today that the US Army has drafted a plan to deploy land and air forces to engage in the first phase of defensive warfare. Chief of Naval Operations Nimitz also announced to the Senate Armed Services Committee that the Joint Chiefs of Staff has drafted a defensive plan, which has been approved by the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy. According to those around Secretary of the Army Patterson: We can safely assume that this plan is constantly being revised and is based on the number of enemies that can be reasonably inferred, and the determination of attacks in many possible ways. This plan only uses the soldiers, guns, ships, and aircraft that may be obtained when attacked, and must be agreed upon by all members of the General Staff before it can proceed.</p>
<p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff is composed of the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the President's military advisor. As for the strength of the Joint General Staff, almost no one knows it today. Military personnel are unwilling to discuss the planning aspects, but in recent months they have strongly stated the importance of this unit and Pacific defense. Army ground troops have conducted extensive experiments in the north, as have the Navy and Air Force. A practical and far-reaching plan for Far East Pacific defense has been formed since the United States and the Philippine government reached an agreement on the issue of US military bases in the Philippines. Within this week, the UN Security Council also passed the US trusteeship of the former Japanese mandated islands, and the defense of the Pacific region between the Philippines and Hawaii will be more convenient in the plan.</p>
<h3>Greek Prince Arrives in France</h3>

<h3>The Depreciation of the Ruble Shows the Tense Relationship Between the United States and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 6th] The New York Herald Tribune stated that due to the tense relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, the price of the ruble outside the Soviet Union has fallen rapidly in recent weeks. The official ratio in countries such as Poland, Iran, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria is 5.5 rubles to 1 US dollar, but diplomatic figures can obtain an exchange rate of 12 to 1. Currently, the exchange rates in Tehran, Sofia, Budapest, and other places are as high as 100 to 1. This devaluation apparently began when the White House announced its policy of aiding Greece and Turkey to resist communism.</p>
<h3>The Security Council Has an Important Meeting Today: Gromyko Will Deliver a Speech</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 6th] At the Security Council meeting on the 7th, Soviet representative Gromyko will deliver an important speech clarifying the Soviet Union's position on the US aid plan to Greece and Turkey. More than 6,000 people in New York have requested admission tickets from United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie, but the gallery of the venue can only accommodate 514 people, so most of those who requested tickets are disappointed. However, the United Nations still has other important meetings on this day, such as the General Disarmament Committee and the Trusteeship Committee, which will both be held, so those who are turned away at the Security Council can go to these two meetings to listen. Gromyko will also deliver a speech at the Disarmament Committee.</p>
<h3>Truman's Speech is Well Received with Thirty-One Applause</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] President Truman delivered a "Jefferson Memorial Day" speech here on the 5th. When he spoke about the US policy of maintaining world peace, he won enthusiastic applause from the audience, and the speech was interrupted 31 times. When Truman spoke about demanding a reduction in "unnecessary high prices," the applause was even more intense. He also received applause when he talked about the budget for this year being balanced and surplus. Truman avoided talking about domestic political issues. Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace was also on the invitation list, but was not present.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 5th] Before President Truman attended the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Day banquet today and delivered a speech, Congressman Rayburn first addressed the Democratic members of Congress and said, "We already have a candidate" who can lead the entire party in the next presidential election, and that person is President Truman. The crowd cheered when they heard this.</p>

<h3>Hodge Talks About US Policy Towards Korea with Determination to Support Democracy</h3>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 5th] Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in southern Korea, has returned to Korea after reporting to the country. He told reporters today that the United States will strengthen democracy in southern Korea and actively develop its economy. If the United States cannot obtain Soviet cooperation, it can only fulfill its obligations alone. The commander of the Soviet army has recently been replaced. Lieutenant General Kolotkov succeeded Lieutenant General Kristenko as the supreme commander. This matter can be valued or not, because we all know that Kristenko is sick. The United States will provide more concrete assistance to the revival of Korea. The US policy does not mean to separate the South Korean government. The only purpose is to continue to develop the economy in the US-occupied area and strengthen its democracy so that Koreans can handle their own affairs as much as possible. The United States only maintains certain controls to assist in the supply of food and make the economy self-reliant. The provisional government in the US-occupied area will be completed. When there is a democratic election mechanism, so that the people can elect the president, vice president, governor and other important officials... government...</p>
<h3>The Viet Minh and Indonesia Sign an Agreement to Prevent the Return of Colonial Rule and Call on Asian Countries to Take Unified Action</h3>

People at the Pan-Asian Conference commented on the last three points: Nehru, the deputy prime minister of the interim government of India, told the Viet Minh representative at the Pan-Asian Conference: Asian countries cannot declare war on France or transport guns and volunteers to assist the Viet Minh.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 5th] Indonesian Minister of Economy Gani revealed today that the government of the Republic of Indonesia has established commercial relations with China, the United States, Malaya, and Australia, and goods from these countries are regularly shipped to southern Sumatra.</p>
<h3>The German Central Administrative Organization Should Be Controlled by the Allied Control Council and the Four Foreign Ministers Have Reached an Agreement After Consultation</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 5th] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference continued to discuss the issue of German political organization today and unanimously decided to place the German Central Administrative Organization under the control of the Allied Control Council, and then gradually establish a German Advisory Committee and a German Provisional Government. The French plan proposed that in addition to the German Central Administrative Organization, a German Administrative Committee should be established separately, controlled by the Allied countries, which was only agreed to by the British and American delegations. As for the Soviet Union, it reserved its decision. Another French proposal advocated that the Saar region should not be under the jurisdiction of the German Central Administrative Organization, and the legal status of the Ruhr region and the Rhine region should be resolved later, so as to ultimately restrict the jurisdiction of the German Central Administrative Organization over these regions. The Soviet Union also adopted a reserved attitude towards the French proposal. As for Britain and the United States, they both expressed their acceptance of the two French proposals, but with one condition, that is, these two proposals should be stipulated in the agreement. The Four Foreign Ministers discussed the issue of German political organization today in accordance with the principles of the report submitted by the Coordination Committee. When discussing the issue of the powers and responsibilities of the commanders of the occupied areas for the German Central Administrative Organization, opinions were quite divergent. Finally, it was decided to return this issue to the Coordination Committee for further review. The Four Foreign Ministers then discussed the issue of establishing a German Advisory Committee. There were many misunderstandings about the date of its establishment. Finally, they unanimously passed the proposal of British Foreign Minister Bevin, stipulating that the German Advisory Committee should be established within three months after the organization of the German Central Administrative Organization. As for the German Provisional Government, it will be organized within nine months after the German Advisory Committee is established. When the Four Foreign Ministers discussed the composition of the German Advisory Committee, the differences of opinion were also very obvious. The French representative proposed a proposal advocating that the Advisory Committee should be attended by three representatives from each state, appointed by the state governments or parliaments in accordance with democratic public opinion. As for the Soviet representative, he proposed that the Advisory Committee should include representatives from political parties, trade unions, and other democratic organizations. The British and American representatives said that they are willing to accept any plan that does not allow the representatives of the German Advisory Committee to go beyond the scope of trade unions and political parties. However, Britain and the United States finally decided to support the French proposal. As for Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, he strongly stated that Nazi and democratic organizations must participate in the work of the Advisory Committee. As a result, the Four Foreign Ministers did not reach an agreement on the composition of the Advisory Committee and decided to return this issue to the Coordination Committee for further discussion.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Ministers Conference May Be Extended to Be Reopened in London or Paris</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 6th] The Moscow correspondent of the Sunday Dispatch wired that the Moscow Conference may adjourn around the 23rd of this month and then reopen in Paris or London. British Foreign Minister Bevin hopes that the conference will be held in London, but Minister of Commerce Cripps expressed his opposition on the grounds of London's material difficulties.</p>
<h3>British Government Conscription Law Amendment: Churchill Expresses Opposition, Conservative Party to Reconsider Attitude Towards Government</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill stated in a declaration at Cadwell today: The government authorities submitted an amendment to the conscription law to the Lower House last Sunday, reducing the term of military service from eighteen months to one year. The Conservative Party will vote against this amendment. Previously, the Conservative and Liberal Parties voted in favor of the government because they felt reassured after hearing public statements from cabinet ministers. We have every reason to believe that the plan submitted by the government to Parliament is the result of long-term and meticulous study by cabinet ministers and is based on the advice of military experts. We also believe that the government's recommendations represent the minimum defense measures that Britain should take in the coming years to meet its needs and fulfill its obligations. However, as it stands, this plan has no basis, has nothing to do with defense needs, and the cabinet ministers who proposed this plan have no confidence in it. This plan exposes the Labor cabinet's weakness and incompetence in handling all matters affecting the people's livelihood, whether large or small, at home or abroad. I declared in the Lower House last Sunday that the Conservative Party not only intends to support the government during the second reading of the bill but also intends to support the government at all stages of the bill. However, we must now reconsider our position and course of action for the benefit of the nation. In addition, Cziriaaks, the leader of the extreme left wing of the Labor Party, met alone with a French news agency reporter today, representing the "Labor Party rebel MPs," and said: If Churchill and his friends vote against the conscription law in the third reading, we will not vote against it. Some moderates in our party may vote against this bill, but I personally will abstain. I believe my friends will also abstain. I and my friends are taking a position against the government's draft in order to change the government's foreign policy, but we are unwilling to give the Conservative Party any opportunity.</p>
<h3>South Korea to Hold Presidential Election in August</h3>

Currently, the military administration is urging the interim legislative assembly to complete the legislation of the universal suffrage bill.</p>
<h3>New Iranian Army to Be Trained by US Military Officers</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 6th] Reliable military sources told this agency's correspondent today that the new Iranian army and gendarmerie will be trained by US military instructors and will be modernized with military equipment supplied by the United States. A sum of US$25 million has now been allocated to purchase this American equipment. It is reported that a part of the Iranian gendarmerie has already been reorganized by US General Schwarzkopf, and the contract between Iran and the US military advisers has also been renewed for two years.</p>
<h3>Soviet Delegation's Receptions in Britain</h3>

During the banquet, Sir Vachikan, the mayor, gave a congratulatory speech, followed by a reply from the leader of the delegation, emphasizing the importance of close cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union in international affairs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, London, 5th Dispatch] The British National Union of Journalists recently decided at its annual meeting in Hastings to organize a delegation to contact the Soviet press and will arrange for Soviet journalists to reciprocate with a visit to Britain.</p>
<h3>Ten Countries Will Apply to Join the United Nations This Year</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 5th] United Nations officials recently stated that Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Finland, Nazi satellite states, will apply to join the United Nations immediately after the ratification of the peace treaties with those countries. Albania, Outer Mongolia, South Ireland, Portugal, and Outer Jordan, the five countries that were rejected by the United Nations last year, will also reapply for membership at the United Nations General Assembly in September this year. If the above ten countries are all allowed to join the United Nations, the Soviet Union will gain six countries, and the Western countries will gain four countries.</p>

<h3>Jinnah Meets Mountbatten; Talks Proceed in a Good Atmosphere; Whether the Muslim League's Attitude Has Changed Remains to Be Seen</h3>
<p>[United Press, New Delhi, 5th] The president of the Muslim League, Jinnah, met with the new Viceroy of India, Mountbatten, today for an informal friendly talk that lasted one hour and fifty minutes. This was the first meeting between Jinnah and Mountbatten. It is rumored that the leaders of the Congress Party are willing to try again to negotiate with the Muslim League to resolve the political and religious disputes in India, but Jinnah's attitude has not been expressed and is only known to Jinnah himself. The Congress Party insists on Indian unity, while Jinnah has repeatedly demanded partition and the establishment of an independent Muslim state. It is unlikely that his opinion has changed at present. The Viceroy's office carefully announced that Mountbatten's talks with Gandhi, the ministers of the Congress-Muslim League in the interim government, and representatives of the Maharaja clans were called "exploratory" and a continuous proposal. Gandhi has met with Mountbatten five times this week.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 5th] After Governor-General Mountbatten met with the chairman of the Muslim League, Jinnah, today, an official communiqué was issued stating: This negotiation was very friendly and lasted for two hours. The Governor-General's intention was to learn the opinions of the two major political parties in India so that he could take concrete measures.</p>
<h3>US Coal Miners' Strike Will Be Extended Indefinitely; Demands Government Guarantee Safety for Miners</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 6th] Lewis and the US government launched another public battle on the 6th. According to news from the National Coal Mine Factory on the 6th, the head of the United Mine Workers, Lewis, has almost obtained the support of forty mining executives, who unanimously refused to return to the mines on Monday. In this new struggle, Lewis issued his opening shot signal, which was to demand that all but two of the 2,000 or so bituminous coal mines nationwide not resume work until they are guaranteed safe working conditions for the miners before resuming work. The one-week work stoppage ordered by Lewis to commemorate the deaths of 111 miners in Illinois due to an accident will clearly be extended indefinitely when it expires at midnight on the 6th. Coal mine owners unanimously believe that Lewis is using the safety issue to implement his strike plan, which has already been decided on April 1st.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador to Greece Recalled to Return to Country</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 6th] The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the reason for recalling the ambassador to Greece was that Greek government newspapers published news of Stalin's so-called meeting with a United Press reporter. The news was fabricated and hostile to the Soviet Union. TASS news today: Soviet Ambassador to Greece Rodionov has been ordered by the government to leave Greece and return to the country.</p>
<h3>Foreigners' Soviet Wives Unable to Return; Soviet Policy Appears to Have Changed</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 5th] Twenty-six Soviet wives of foreigners are waiting for exit passports today so that they can reunite with their husbands, but they fear that they will not be able to get their wish. In this matter, Marshal Stalin has given British Foreign Minister Bevin a negative answer. According to a recent decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, if passports are no longer issued to Soviet wives of foreigners in the future, then Soviet policy appears to have changed. During the war and the year after the war, the Soviet Union issued about twenty such passports. Since the beginning of the war, foreigners who have married Soviet women include one ambassador, one minister, one chargé d'affaires, one US major, and two captains. There are also some British and American junior officers and soldiers who have married Soviet women. These brides have all received exit passports.</p>

<h3>Norway Actively Rebuilding: Striving to Get Rid of Soviet Control</h3>
<p>— Special Translation by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Norway is now advancing rapidly on the road to recovery, preparing to fully restore its pre-war state by the end of next year. It is believed that only in this way can it get rid of Soviet economic control. At the beginning of 1947, the Norwegian government prepared to ratify a two-year Norwegian-Soviet trade agreement. Norway is willing to trade with the Soviet Union, but it is unwilling to be subjected to excessively strict or excessively long-term constraints by any country. At the same time, under the current situation, the Soviet Union has no reason to demand the signing of a more binding treaty at this time.</p>
<p>Norway's neighbor Sweden cannot have such independence. Some businessmen and politicians used to do more business with the Soviet Union before the war, but now they feel that maintaining neutrality is not necessarily a good deal. Recently, Sweden agreed to lend the Soviet Union US$280 million for a period of fifteen years, and also signed an agreement with the Soviet Union to exchange goods worth US$140 million for the same amount of Soviet goods in the next five years. This transaction has greatly reduced Sweden's trade with Western countries.</p>
<p>The situation in Norway is different. It expects the United Nations to succeed. In order to free it from the economic constraints of the Soviet Union or other countries, Norway has contributed its former Foreign Minister Lie to the United Nations. The current Norwegian government believes that economic coordination can be achieved through international agreements. The Norwegian authorities are determined to try this method before being drawn into the vortex of the East or the West.</p>
<p>The resolution of this year's United Nations conference on the establishment of an international trade organization has a great relationship to any new economic trends in Norway. This westernmost country in Northern Europe is also a member of the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund. As for Sweden, it has not yet joined these two organizations and seems to be taking a wait-and-see attitude towards their value.</p>
<p>At the same time, Norway is unwilling to formally accept the US$50 million credit loan that the US Export-Import Bank is prepared to give it, because US law stipulates that goods purchased by foreign countries from the United States must be transported by American ships. Norway, whose main export business is foreign transportation, is not eager to use a small number of US dollars to deal with the businesses that it can complete itself.</p>
<p>The trade treaty signed by Norway and the Soviet Union includes the exchange of Norwegian fish for Soviet charcoal and other chemical raw materials. The economic delegation has not given up considering future long-term contracts, but, at present, Norway is already concluding temporary contracts with other countries. Minister of Supply Tabby and Minister of Finance Blovoss believe that this type of treaty can best guarantee Norway's goal of achieving full recovery by the end of next year.</p>
<p>It may be beneficial to the Soviet Union if it allows Norway to develop freely without interfering. The Soviet Union may be able to use Norway's current major exports such as paper, mobile houses, and zero production, but even if these Norwegian goods are reduced to a minimum, the Soviet Union can still maintain itself.</p>
<p>The thing that the Soviet Union is particularly concerned about is that it uses most of the Norwegian merchant ships to enter and exit the iron ore area of ​​Narvik and obtain steel from Norwegian iron factories.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1947, the situation in Norway was relatively good and it was gradually improving. Production has reached pre-war levels. Although the amount of currency issued has gradually increased and there is inflation, the government is trying to control it and increase foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>Housing construction is relatively lagging behind, but compared with the housing shortages in other countries ravaged by the Nazi invaders, it is not worth mentioning. Food is quite sufficient and is gradually increasing. Although clothing and shoes are still scarce, the supply has increased compared to half a year ago. The transportation industry is the key to Norway's construction and prosperity. The profits of merchant ships can usually offset the trade deficit, and now this profit is gradually increasing, and soon Norway can restore a favorable trade balance.</p>
<p>Fishery is Norway's main domestic trade, and the 1946 catch created a new record. The whaling ship industry has set out to hunt whales and will return fully loaded to enrich the national economy. The Soviet Union has begun to become interested in this industry and has specifically asked Norway to help it become familiar with whaling technology.</p>
<p>In the next few years, Norway will develop various new industries. First, because Germany as a producer is completely done for, there are many markets that can be seized. Second, because after the destruction of German industry, Norway has to manufacture many things that it used to buy from foreign countries. The largest of the industrial plans is the construction of a steel manufacturing plant worth US$60 million.</p>
<p>Industrialists believe that this plan is necessary in today's world where there is a shortage of steel materials. Norway has always relied on the profits from mineral ore exports to purchase steel plates and steel skins, and the current plan requires the domestic production of 200,000 tons of steel annually.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a great plan to expand hydroelectric power facilities, but it is progressing slowly. At the same time, considerable efforts are also being made to develop the plastics industry to meet international markets and to develop rayon and other fabrics to meet domestic markets.</p>
<p>Norwegians are unusually concerned and even indignant about the trade agreement between the Soviet Union and Sweden. They particularly hope to get Swedish electrical machinery, but now they are worried that they will only get a small part of the ordered electrical machinery. They also feel that Norway's position with respect to the Soviet Union has been weakened due to Sweden's concessions.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Communist Party fully supports Sweden's loan to the Soviet Union and asks that its own country take the same measures. However, some communists are suspected of colluding with the Nazis before Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, so they are not noticed today.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's economic power has penetrated Finland and Sweden. Whether this power will penetrate deeper into Norway depends first of all on Norway's attitude and efforts.</p>
<p>Norwegians are very optimistic about the future. Now that the war is over, they can concentrate on planning everything. They quickly recovered from the German occupation. Under the efforts of reconstruction and nation-building, Norway will become a rich and powerful country again in a few years, which can be predicted.</p>

<h3>Bullets Flying on Meizhou Road: Conflict Between Soldiers and Police Leads to Bloodshed; One Wounded Soldier Shot, Two Passersby Killed and Wounded; Garrison Headquarters, Police Bureau, and Wounded Soldiers' Side Negotiate for Peaceful Resolution</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] A large number of wooden materials piled up in front of the Xinhua Water and Electricity Materials Factory at No. 1341 Pingliang Road were suddenly stolen at 3 or 4 o'clock yesterday morning, with 26 pieces of wood and two large collapsed car wheels lost. It was not until 9 o'clock in the morning that the factory discovered the theft and immediately sent someone to report it to the Yangshupu Police Sub-bureau under its jurisdiction. Wang Xinheng, the chief of the sub-bureau, ordered the criminal division to investigate. The factory also sent someone to the bureau. Part of the stolen materials was found at the Chaoyang School wooden bridge, and it was said that the theft was committed by wounded soldiers. At about 1:30 p.m., two plainclothes police officers, No. 942 and No. 870, and uniformed police officers, No. 855 and No. 913, were ordered to go out for investigation. While passing by the Chaoyang Theater at Xiaomu Bridge on Meizhou Road, they caught sight of wounded soldiers mixed with people gambling by the roadside. When the police officers arrived, some of the people scattered in panic, but a few people continued to gamble with the wounded soldiers. The police officers immediately stepped forward to intervene, and the wounded soldiers refused to comply, leading to a quarrel. First, several wounded soldiers snatched a police hat from police officer No. 855, and the official gun of plainclothes police officer No. 870 was also seized. The police officers were outnumbered and fled, while the wounded soldiers</p>
<p>gathered more and more</p>
<p>About 200 people, subsequently chased after them, and finally dragged police officer Zhang Pingan, No. 870, away. At the same time, three off-duty police officers, No. 1108, No. 1074, and No. 1053, were passing by the wounded soldiers' hospital at Chaoyang Road on Meizhou Road and were also dragged into the hospital. When the police officers fled, the wounded soldiers fired many shots afterwards, fortunately without injuring anyone. Seeing that the wounded soldiers were chasing after them, the police officers hid in the Meizhou Road police station. When the wounded soldiers arrived, they threw stones, wooden sticks, bamboo poles, and hand grenades without gunpowder at the station, and smashed the police station's sign and glass doors and windows. Inspector Pan Zhaohong went out to dissuade them and was hit in the head twice with an iron bar. At the same time, Wang Xianglin, the director of the wounded soldiers' hospital, also tracked them down</p>
<p>but his suppression was ineffective</p>
<p>He was also injured in the hand by a weapon. In addition, Chen Zisheng, a student at the police training school, was passing by the place and was also hit in the head with an iron bar, causing serious injuries. A wallet containing 130,000 legal tender and a fountain pen was lost. In addition, the police station's team leader, Wang Lixing, who was passing by on duty, also lost a police hat, a gold ring, and a newly purchased Stalin watch in the chaos. At that time, police officer No. 855, Zeng, fired a shot, and a wounded soldier, Zhao Xingchang, was seriously injured. Chief Wang of the sub-bureau, upon receiving the report, urgently reported to the headquarters and requested that security police be dispatched in police vehicles. The garrison headquarters also dispatched special service companies and gendarmerie teams one after another, and the situation became tense for a while, and traffic was cut off. When the two sides confronted each other, the wounded soldiers fired more than ten shots, and the police also</p>
<p>returned fire with many shots</p>
<p>For a time, bullets flew everywhere. At that time, a man named Sun Caisheng (from Huzhou, living at No. 91 Changshou Road) was passing by the entrance of a sauce garden on Meizhou Road. He was shot in the chest and died on the spot. Another child, Wang Zengjia, nine years old, from Huai'an, was struck by a stray bullet that penetrated his right back and right waist, and was later sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment. Military police personnel did not withdraw their troops until 6 p.m. Subsequently, Team Leader Chen of the garrison headquarters, Company Commander Zhang of the gendarmerie team, and Chief Wang Xinheng of the sub-bureau, together with the wounded soldiers' officers, negotiated a settlement. First, the four detained police officers were released, and the injured were sent to the police hospital for treatment. By late at night, there was no news of the return of the firearms. Finally, the wounded soldiers' side also sent a representative to accompany the military police negotiators to the garrison headquarters to seek a reasonable solution. Afterwards, it was learned that the group of wounded soldiers had just been transferred from the Shandong front line to Shanghai for medical treatment. There were about 800 people, and they had an organization of guards, equipped with various weapons.</p>

<h3>Chinese Staff Captured on Wake Gunboat Request Compensation from US Navy Department</h3>
<p>Chinese Staff Representatives Host Reporters</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The U.S. gunboat Wake was docked on the Huangpu River during the Anti-Japanese War. On December 8, 1941, when the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese Navy seized the ship, and all the American and Chinese personnel on board were captured by the Japanese invaders and imprisoned in the Zhabei Meteorological Observatory concentration camp. They were then transferred to the Jiangsu First Prison in Nanjing, where the captured Chinese personnel were forced to work as laborers. Several people were crippled due to brutal beatings by the enemy. Among them was Liu Baoxian, who, unwilling to live under the iron heel of the enemy, seized an opportunity to escape, but was unfortunately recaptured by the Japanese and imprisoned in another location, his fate unknown to this day. After the victory, the Wake gunboat was taken over by our country and renamed the "Taiyuan" warship. The American captain, Smith, is working at the Jianghai Customs, but there has been no news about the aftermath of the Chinese personnel. Yesterday afternoon, representatives of the Chinese staff of the warship hosted reporters. Guo Fengting reported the events, saying, "We captured Chinese staff were imprisoned for four years, and our personal bodies suffered greatly. Our families' lives were full of poverty. Although Captain Smith sympathized with us after the victory and requested wartime compensation from the U.S. Navy Department, there has been no news for over a year. We have not been assigned work, and the salaries for the period of our suffering have not been paid. We have pawned everything and exhausted all our resources. Our families are crying out for food. It is a truly tragic situation. We request sympathy and assistance from people in society, and we hope to urge the U.S. Navy Department to pay our salaries and compensation for the period of our suffering as soon as possible, for which we will be eternally grateful."</p>

<h3>Trams Stop, Elevators Suspended: Total Line Failure Causes Two-Hour Power Outage Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] At 9:50 AM yesterday, the power plant of the American-owned Shanghai Electric Power Company at 375 Feilun Road had a total power line failure, causing a sudden power outage in all districts. The company's engineering department dispatched personnel to repair the problem, and the main line was restored at around 11:20 AM. During the power outage, all British-owned trams stopped, causing delays. Public buses became even more crowded, and rickshaws and pedicabs tripled their fares. Yesterday was a bi-weekly day when cinemas opened early shows, but the sudden power outage prevented the screenings.

Elevators in major buildings also suddenly stopped in mid-air due to the power outage, leaving passengers temporarily unable to disembark. According to the engineering department of the power company, the power outage was caused by a worker accidentally touching the motor while refueling, which damaged the main line. A worker named Zhang Deyuan (27 years old, residing at No. 261, Lane 20, Wumeizhou Road) was injured in the left hand, right leg, and abdomen and was immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by the company.</p>

<h3>New Abbot of Jing'an Temple: Master Chi Song is a Scholar Who Remained Secluded During the Eight-Year War of Resistance, Plans to Do More Charity and Public Welfare in the Future</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Special Report] We went to Jing'an Temple to visit the first abbot of the converted Shifang Buddhist Temple, Master Chi Song (pictured), but he had not yet returned. Sitting in the abbot's reception room, Master Xu Xiang briefly told us about the new abbot's past history. He said that Master Chi Song is a scholar and an elder of Buddhism who had twice resolved to travel to Japan. During the eight-year War of Resistance, he had been living in seclusion in the Guandi Temple on Danshui Road in the city. Although the Japanese who knew him had repeatedly invited him to preside over Buddhist affairs in Shanghai, the old master had always remained reclusive and had not received a single Japanese guest during those eight years. This time, he was jointly recommended by various Buddhist protectors and lay Buddhists, as well as the monks and nuns of Jing'an Temple, as the first abbot of the Shifang Buddhist Temple. He humbly declined but was not allowed to, so he presented four regulations. After being supported by all parties, he took the seat and assumed office.</p>
<p>Two hours later, we met Master Chi Song, chairman of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Buddhist Association, at the original location. He was not the white-haired, star-eyed figure we had imagined. He had a lean body, wore a light gray monk's robe, and had a pair of deep eyes behind his wide-rimmed glasses.</p>
<p>Talking About Disputes Over Temple Property</p>
<p>The old master spoke calmly, starting with the topic of Jing'an Temple. He said, "Since the early years of the Republic of China, Jing'an Temple has been plagued by endless disputes over temple property. In fact, Jing'an Temple is still in debt. Just at the end of last year, we barely made it through the year by borrowing money. Currently, there are over 100 monks in the temple. The income from Buddhist ceremonies and rent is barely enough to cover expenses." Speaking of Jing'an Temple's debt, he also talked about the history of disputes over temple property since the Republic of China, which led to the imprisonment of monks De Wu and Mi Jia after the victory.</p>
<p>According to the old master, Jing'an Temple currently owns 40 to 50 acres of land, including the temple grounds, the Jing'an Police Station, and the Jing'an Primary School. However, most of the land was leased to others in the early years of the Republic of China for long-term contracts of 30, 50, or 70 years, so many of the leases have not yet expired, and the rent was collected in full at the time. In addition, the road in front of the temple was originally not temple property. For the benefit of the local public, the price of the land was not collected from the Public Works Department at the beginning.</p>
<p>Originally a Desolate Village</p>
<p>As we were talking, the dismissal bell of Jing'an Primary School rang through the wall, and the sound of bells and the noise of people disturbed the tranquility of the abbot's room. Master Xu Xiang stepped forward to close the window for us, but the noise continued to enter the room. The old master then told us that Jing'an Temple was founded during the Three Kingdoms period in Eastern Wu and has a history of more than 1,700 years. Originally, it was a desolate village, and now, as we sit in the abbot's room, we can hear the voices of students from Jing'an Primary School and the sounds of bells and musical instruments from the temple, and we can even faintly hear the sound of horns from 1946-style American cars speeding along the asphalt road in front of the temple. But this was originally a desolate village!</p>
<p>Reorganized as a Shifang Buddhist Temple</p>
<p>If it had not prospered along with Shanghai's prosperity, this famous Buddhist temple in Southeast China could have avoided many disputes over temple property caused by fame and fortune. The ancient temple would not be located in a large city like today, and there would be no secular places like banks and dance halls next to it. Jing'an Temple might have appeared among small bridges, flowing water, bamboo groves, and dense forests. Within the tall red walls, the "monks" could have been much quieter, and Master Chi Song would not have had to say things like "Please do not burden me with trivial matters."</p>
<p>The reorganization of Jing'an Temple from a master-disciple ordination system to a Shifang Buddhist Temple that selects the worthy is undoubtedly a major transformation. Disputes over temple property may be eliminated as a result. The old master is a scholar and is currently reorganizing and reforming temple affairs, planning to reduce Buddhist ceremonies in the future and do more charity and public welfare, and to make contributions in culture. This would truly conform to the Buddhist tenets of saving the world and benefiting all beings.</p>
<h3>Tragedy of the Sinking of the Fubo Gunboat: List of Deceased Officers and Soldiers Announced, Navy Headquarters Actively Handling the Aftermath</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The list of 130 officers and soldiers who died in the sinking of the Fubo gunboat near Xiamen was announced by Gao Rufeng, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Navy Headquarters, at a reception for reporters at the Navy Recreation Club yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. More than 30 family members of the deceased officers and soldiers registered in Shanghai, including Wang Ruiqing, were also present. Gao also issued a written statement, stating: The news of the Fubo warship disaster shocked the officers and soldiers, and Commander-in-Chief Gui expressed his condolences. They then took various necessary measures and proceeded in different ways. First, the Xiamen Naval Port Command and the Taiwan Base Command were ordered to dispatch the Xiamen warship and the Taiping warship to the waters where the accident occurred and the nearby islands to search and investigate, but the results were fruitless. After the Hai Min ship arrived in Shanghai on March 26, the department sent Section Chief Liang Tongyi to Shanghai to cooperate with relevant parties to conduct a preliminary investigation. Regarding the responsibility of the Haimin ship, since the only survivor of the Fubo warship was the marine engineer Jiao Dexiao, and he was a member of the engine room and was unclear about the navigation situation at the time, the only information available for research was the data provided by the Haimin ship. As for the rescue part, according to the passengers of the ship, they witnessed the situation at the time and said that the ship did not make efforts to rescue them, and that the Haimin ship failed to rescue those in need, which is a fact. The headquarters attaches great importance to the comfort of the family members and the handling of the aftermath and has successively sent personnel to both Beijing and Shanghai to individually comfort the bereaved families and has established a special agency at the headquarters to actively handle the aftermath. It is hoped that the families scattered in various places will send their addresses to the Personnel Office of the First Department of the Navy Headquarters in Nanjing for contact at any time. The list of deceased officers and soldiers is as follows:</p>
<p>Officers</p>

<h3>Land Prices Increase a Thousandfold in Ten Years: New Standard Prices Assessed for Registered Land in Six Districts, Municipal Government to Announce Regularly</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Before the war, the rate of increase in land prices in Shanghai was originally higher than that of general commodities, but after the War of Resistance, the rate of increase in general commodities was higher than that of land prices, which was the opposite. According to statistics, based on the retail prices of basic commodities in the city from January to June of the 26th year of the Republic of China, prices increased by a total of 6,082 times by December of the 35th year, a period of only ten years. However, during the same period, land prices in the Chinese and Western districts of Huangpu District only increased by 1,275 times, an average annual increase of 140 times. In the past, during the era of booming new construction and the strongest demand for land, the average annual increase was only a few times, and even in the most special locations, the average annual increase was only more than ten times. Now, the annual increase is more than a hundred times, which is not due to the increase in land prices but to the devaluation of currency. Therefore, this kind of increase is an abnormal phenomenon.</p>
<p>After the victory, the city had a committee for evaluating standard land prices. Recently, due to the sharp rise in prices after the gold dollar storm, a meeting was held a few days ago to assess the latest standard land prices for the land in the six districts of Huangpu, Hunan, Zhabei, Fahua, Yinxiang, and Caojing that have completed land registration, based on their district segments and grades.</p>
<p>Huangpu District</p>
<p>Divided into 26 grades for A, 20 grades for B, 22 grades for C, 23 grades for D, and 16 grades for E. Among them, Grade A-1 is the corner land on Nanjing Road Bund, with an average land price of 550 million yuan per mu. Grade E-16 is the area north of Guiyang Road and Pingliang Road that is not along the road, with an average land price of 4.5 million yuan per mu.</p>
<p>Hunan District:</p>
<p>Divided into 30 grades for A, 30 grades for B, 20 grades for C, and 15 grades for D. Among them, Grade A-1 is the land along the shop front in the 16th Pudong area, with an average price of 120 million yuan per mu. Grade D-15 is the area west of Longhua Port and Dongmiao Bridge Road, with an average price of 1.2 million yuan per mu.</p>
<p>Zhabei District:</p>
<p>Divided into 20 grades for A, 21 grades for B, 21 grades for C, and 20 grades for D. Among them, Grade A-1 is the area around North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road, with an average price of 90 million yuan per mu. Grade D-20 is the area on the northeast section of Song Park Road and the western area of Pusan Road on the south section of Danjin Port, with an average price of 1 million yuan per mu.</p>
<p>Fahua District:</p>
<p>Divided into 19 grades for A, 22 grades for B, 18 grades for C, and 24 grades for D. Among them, Grade A-1 is the land at the corner of Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road, with an average price of 50 million yuan per mu. Grade D-24 is the area west of the Xinpu Huitang North Railway, with an average price of 750,000 yuan per mu.</p>
<p>Yinxiang District:</p>
<p>Divided into 8 grades for A, 10 grades for B, 20 grades for C, and 4 grades for D. Grade A-1 is the corner of Qimei Road and Diswei Road, along the corners of Diswei Road, Tiantong Road, and Tongjia Road, with an average price of 22 million yuan per mu. Grade D-4 is the area around Lijia Gou and Xijia Bang, with an average price of 850,000 yuan per mu.</p>
<p>Caojing District:</p>
<p>Divided into 3 grades for A, 5 grades for B, and 3 grades for C. Among them, Grade A-1 is Panjiazhai and Caohejing Town in Longhua Town, with an average price of 3 million yuan per mu. Grade C-6 is farmland in Xujiazhai and other areas north of Xin Jinggang, with an average price of 600,000 yuan per mu. The detailed land prices for each district segment will be announced regularly by the municipal government.</p>
<p>List (Dist) said: "There is no more definitive standard for measuring the progress and decline of national welfare than the rise and fall of land value." By comparing the land price of 550 million yuan per mu with the land price of 600,000 yuan per mu, we can get a glimpse of which area is the most prosperous in Shanghai today.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation: Legal Queries</h3>
<p>Chen Liang asks: Mr. A has two rooms and before renting them to Mr. B, it was agreed that Mr. B must vacate them when Mr. A's eldest son gets married, therefore Mr. A did not accept any gratuities. Last year, Mr. A's eldest son got married and Mr. A wants Mr. B to move out immediately, but Mr. B is deliberately delaying. After Mr. A's son's marriage, they are cramped in a small room. Questions: (1) Is it possible to order him to move out within a certain period, given that no rent has been collected for over two years? (2) Is it possible to take back one of the two rooms first? (3) Now that Mr. A's second son is also getting married, what legal measures should be taken if Mr. B still refuses to move?</p>
<p>[Answer from Lawyer Jiang Pingfan] Whether there was a special agreement when A rented the two rooms to B, stipulating that B must move out when A's eldest son gets married, should be based on evidence. This special agreement is a reason for reclaiming the property for self-use. According to the law, one can request the termination of the lease and the return of the property based on reclaiming for self-use. A's failure to collect rent from B is not a reason to terminate the lease. Whether to reclaim one room or all rooms usually depends on the actual need. A can file a lawsuit with the court.</p>

<h3>Radium Institute Plans to Be Transformed into Atomic Energy Institute: Li Shuhua Talks to Reporters After Returning to Peiping from Nanking</h3>
<p>[Our Peiping Correspondent, 6th] Li Shuhua, Director of the Peiping Research Institute, returned to Peiping from Nanking via Tianjin yesterday. Today, he told reporters: (1) On this trip to Nanking, he negotiated with the Ministry of Education for an increase in funding. The Ministry of Education has approved an additional temporary allocation of 400 million yuan for expansion and improvement of buildings. However, this amount is only equivalent to just over 30,000 yuan before the war, which is still insufficient. (2) Regarding the number of staff positions in the institute, according to the organizational regulations, there should be more than 210 people. After the victory and restoration, the Ministry of Education only temporarily granted 109 positions. This trip to Nanking to negotiate for more positions has not yet yielded any results. (3) The Institute of Materia Medica and the Radium Institute of our institute are still in Shanghai and there are currently no plans to move them to Peiping. Because these two institutes did not suffer war damage, they have now been restored to their pre-war state. However, the Radium Institute is currently planning to apply for funding to upgrade instruments and equipment in preparation for its transformation into an Atomic Energy Institute.</p>

Although there was inevitably some regression during the war, if funding continues for further study, the original level can be restored in five years.

<h3>In Respectful Response to Mr. Deng Gongsan Regarding National Standard Textbooks (Concluded)</h3>
<p>— Lu Dianyang</p>
<p>Ancient England was conquered successively by the Anglo-Saxons, the Danes, and the Normans, and William the Conqueror even became the ruler of England. During the invasion of foreign tribes, there was inevitable trampling, but in English history, these events are invariably acknowledged. The narrative is straightforward and does not regard the Celtic Britons as "Xia" while regarding the Normans and Danes as "barbarians," nor does it consider this to be England's "greatest humiliation." The current English people have integrated with the various invading tribes to become a great nation. Since our country has combined the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, Tibetan, and Miao peoples into a great Chinese nation, when writing history, we should only acknowledge the Yuan and Qing dynasties, record the facts, and avoid praise and criticism. We should also emphasize the cultural exchange and emotional harmony between the various ethnic groups from a positive perspective to promote the inward cohesion of the border ethnic groups. Nationally compiled textbooks must be provided for young people of all ethnic groups across the country. Middle school students in the nine northeastern provinces, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang all read this book. If we follow Mr. Deng's opinion and focus on the Han people, what would the border youth think when they read it? Therefore, the content of the nationally compiled junior high school history textbooks may have areas for improvement in the details, but the general principles and prerequisites seem to be in order and are superior to past history textbooks. As for the fifth clause of the book's editorial guidelines, which refers to "relying on traditional historical concepts," it refers to the legends of the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang in ancient times. Therefore, the following sentence immediately follows: "Materials from recent archaeological discoveries that are sufficient to promote the culture of our ancestors should also be adopted as appropriate." After all, historical education is different from historical research. Historical researchers may deny the existence of the Yellow Emperor and others, but historical teachers must still acknowledge ancient legends before the unearthed materials can be connected into a system, in order to show the achievements of our ancestors in creating culture.</p>
<p>The second point in Mr. Deng's article with which I cannot agree is his criticism of the "Dam Construction" lesson in high elementary school Chinese. "Dam construction" is dike, which can also be called a sluice, and it is an important project in water conservancy engineering. Recently, newspapers and books have been praising America's TVA, considering it President Roosevelt's greatest contribution to the American people. The so-called TVA is the Tennessee Valley Authority. Our country also has plans for a Yangtze Valley Authority, planning for large-scale dam construction near Yichang. Dr. Savage, who was hired to inspect the Yellow River, also advocated setting up sluices and building dams to control the water flow. The reason why Sichuan has become the "Land of Abundance" is due to the Dujiangyan irrigation system in Guanxian, in addition to natural causes. Dujiangyan is our country's old-fashioned dam construction, which only benefits irrigation, and the Chengdu Plain has been able to feed itself thanks to it. There are many other examples, which cannot be listed exhaustively. Dam construction regulates water flow, which can prevent flooding, benefit navigation, provide irrigation, and generate electricity (hydropower does not require coal, which is the most economical, and the electricity generation is very large). Agriculture, industry, and commerce all benefit from it, so it is not an exaggeration to say that it is the most beneficial project for mankind, and it is also appropriate to say that it is the main driving force of modern civilization. Our country's literati really lack knowledge of scientific engineering, so the teaching materials on economic construction in high elementary school Chinese textbooks have been specially increased, hoping that the next generation of citizens will not make fools of themselves in their speeches, and the future construction of the country will need thousands of future water conservancy engineering experts.</p>
<p>In short, the nationally compiled primary and secondary school textbooks were hastily compiled by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau during the War of Resistance, under difficult circumstances in the rear, with both manpower and material resources being limited, in order to meet the urgent need and alleviate the shortage of books. After the publication of the provisional editions, we did not presume to be confident, and we repeatedly convened expert review meetings to revise each lesson and sent them to normal colleges and national normal schools in the rear to solicit opinions. At that time, experts and education scholars in various subjects near Chongqing either accepted invitations to come to the bureau, or attended meetings to provide advice, or sent letters for consultation, and they all helped sincerely. Mr. Deng Gongsan was also one of the scholars who officially accepted an invitation to the bureau in the summer of the 34th year of the Republic to revise the textbooks. Mr. Deng revised the six volumes of junior high school history, originally scheduled to be completed during the summer vacation, but was extended to the end of November before it was completed. In the meantime, it lasted five months. Except for the sixth volume of foreign history, which he said he had not studied in depth and did not undertake to revise, for the remaining five volumes, three volumes were revised on the basis of the published provisional editions, and the fourth and fifth volumes were revised on the basis of the original manuscripts. The provisional editions sent to Mr. Deng for revision had already undergone a lot of revisions, such as the section on Qin Shihuang's burning of books and burying scholars mentioned above. After Mr. Deng's revision, they were revised by others, and then the corrections were compiled and sent to the Seven United Office for typesetting. The names of all experts or scholars who have revised the nationally compiled textbooks are listed on the copyright page to show respect and express gratitude. "Deng Guangming," which is Mr. Deng Gongsan, is printed under the name of the reviser on the copyright page of the fourth and fifth volumes of the Shanghai edition of junior high school history. I am deeply grateful to Mr. Deng for his support and willingness to revise the textbooks and share the literary responsibility with us. We often encouraged each other in our discussions on how to improve the teaching materials. Now, the revised edition of junior high school history will be published soon, and Mr. Deng's revisions can be seen by the world. Since many parties have written to inquire about this matter, I have briefly described it to inform the gentlemen who care about primary and secondary school teaching materials.</p>
<h3>Eastern China's Three Goals Settle Tianshan Mountain, Western Alliance Suffers Total Annihilation, 20,000 Fans at Recreation Park Roar with Joy</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The spring sunshine is bright and the breeze is gentle. The ever-victorious Eastern China team and the Western Alliance team held a football charity match at Recreation Park on [a recent] day. The audience flocked in, totaling about 20,000 people. The field was packed, and the rooftops on the south side were filled with fans, marking the first grand occasion of the year. The ticket revenue was used to fund sports facility construction in the Nanshi area. Before the match, the Western Alliance team captain presented flowers to Eastern China. Then, City Government Secretary-General He Dekui represented the Mayor to kick off the ball, and the fierce battle began. As a result, Eastern China scored three goals to settle the Tianshan Mountain, and the Western Alliance suffered total annihilation. In the first half, Dai Linjing and Han Longhai each scored a goal, giving Eastern China a 2-0 lead. In the second half, the Western Alliance launched a fierce counterattack, and the situation became tense for a time. Fortunately, Eastern China fought hard to maintain their lead. Finally, Sun Jinshun scored the third goal, securing the victory. 20,000 fans roared with joy.</p>

<p>McNitty, Mania, Xue Pansiting, Luo Hui, McLure, Jielinkov, Novogolov, Edward, Robert Stoff, Carlo Leitch, Vaughn (down), Copsding (up)</p>
<p>Adai Scores, Opens the Record</p>
<p>At precisely 3:00 PM, referee Chen Jixiang, linesmen Wu Shouheng and He Chunhui, the two armies lined up. The Western Alliance presented flowers to pay respect to Eastern China. Then, City Secretary He kicked off the ball, and the fierce battle began. The Western Alliance attacked, with "Little Yellow Hair" attempting a solo raid, but was blocked by Longbo. Eastern China counterattacked, with Jinshun threading the needle, Linjing attempting a shot, McNitty parrying it out, and Li Yao's hook shot going slightly wide. After ten minutes, the Western Alliance launched a large-scale attack, with five forwards rushing in together. Novogolov crossed the ball, and Edward shot fiercely from 20 yards out. The ball was swift and dangerous, but Banglun was agile and saved the dangerous ball. Eastern China took the opportunity to rise again, with Adai stepping into the formation and penetrating deep into enemy territory. By the time Mania caught up, the ball had already entered the net. 1-0, Eastern China opened the record.</p>
<p>Amidst the Sound of Firecrackers, Eastern China Wins Again</p>
<p>Only thirteen minutes into the game, Eastern China gained momentum after scoring, and Youliang and Li Yao flanked from both wings, overwhelming McNitty. Later, the Western Alliance once gained a corner kick opportunity, but fortunately, Lingen cleared the ball with a long kick. In the melee, five minutes before the end of the first half, Lao Sun received assistance from Lingen and passed it to Linjing, who passed it to Longhai, who shot it into the net from ten yards away. 2-0, Eastern China scored another victory. The sound of firecrackers from the sidelines was deafening. Before long, the first half ended.</p>
<p>Western Alliance Counterattacks, Futile Efforts</p>
<p>Changing sides and fighting again, Eastern China made no changes, while Vaughn came on for the Western Alliance, and Copsding retired. After contact, the Western Alliance launched a large-scale counterattack, attempting to retaliate. Vaughn repeatedly used his breakthroughs, but without success. Novogolov continued his efforts, but unfortunately Banglun blocked high and low, making the goal impenetrable. "Little Yellow Hair" was nailed by Longbo and was also powerless. By the eighth minute, Youliang and Longhai were exceptionally active, repeatedly attacking the Western Alliance. McNitty performed brilliantly, and veteran Dai came to knock on the door himself, but still failed to open it. The Western Alliance had a turn for the better, and the situation became urgent again. Alarms were repeatedly sent from Eastern China's hinterland. However, at the last moment, they were able to turn danger into safety and protect their territory.</p>
<p>Lao Sun's Iron Leg, Breaks Through Three Barriers</p>
<p>At the seventeenth minute, Lao Sun took advantage of a gap and launched a cold arrow, McNitty missed, and the ball hit the target again. 3-0, Eastern China's good news spread for the third time. After this, the Western Alliance still tried to bet everything on one throw, but their eagerness to win led to more mistakes. Longhai launched a sneak attack, and McNitty left his post without permission. Just when things were critical, Mania arrived and was able to save the situation. By the 38th minute, Longhai left the field with a leg injury, and Chen Mingzhe replaced him. Although the battle was tense, neither side made any gains. By the time the allotted time was up, Eastern China defeated the Western Alliance 3-0, maintaining their reputation as perennial victors.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Governor's Cup Soccer Final Ends in Another Draw</h3>
<p>China United Team Experiences Joy and Disappointment</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper, Hong Kong] The situation for the six major soccer championships in Hong Kong this season has largely been determined. The Stanley Shield seven-a-side tournament was won by Sing Tao early on, and the league championship also belongs to Sing Tao. Unfortunately, the "Memorial Cup" was won by the Army. The remaining "Governor's Cup," "Special Silver Plate," and "International Cup" also have scheduled final battles. The "Governor's Cup" was contested by the General Association and the Association on the 30th. The Sing Tao and South China teams will play the final of the Special Silver Plate on April 5th (Saturday). Recall that in the first battle of the Governor's Cup (February 9th), the two sides drew 4-4. The rematch today saw an unprecedented grand occasion at Jia Shan. On this day, the Western Alliance played with its original lineup, while China United made slight changes due to Qiu Ting's absence and Zhao Rong's foot injury. Jing Xiang supervised the team with an injury. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>(China United Team) Association</p>
<p>Yu Yaosui (Sing Tao)</p>
<p>Xie Jinhong (South China), Hou Rongsheng (Sing Tao)</p>
<p>Feng Kunshing (Sing Tao), Xu Jincheng (Sing Tao), Liu Songsheng (Sing Tao)</p>
<p>Zhuo Shijin (Guanghua), Zou Wenzhi (South China), Feng Jingxiang (Sing Tao), Zhu Yongqiang (South China), Xie Jinhe (South China)</p>
<p>(Western Alliance Team) General Association</p>
<p>Powell (42nd Battalion)</p>
<p>Dia (45th Battalion), Hua Liu (Hong Kong Club)</p>
<p>Anderson (Air Force), Chen Li (St. Joseph's), Sege (Artillery)</p>
<p>Ford (42nd Battalion), Wu Lun (Hong Kong Club), Ihus (Navy), Sullivan (Wireless), Little Gao Shannu (St. Joseph's) Captain</p>
<p>Each Side Ties Once</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, referee Ye Jiugao gave the order, and the two sides made contact. "Magic Leg" Jingxiang dribbled the ball to attack, and the ball was in a melee in the Western Alliance's hinterland. After four minutes, Shijin got a chance to cross the ball, and Wenzhi responded in time, kicking the ball from 15 yards out and into the net at the left corner. China United took the lead.</p>
<p>After seven minutes, the Western Alliance advanced, and Jinhong was careless, allowing Gao Shannu to pass the ball in. Wu Lun rushed forward and shot quickly. By the time Yaode tried to save, the ball had already flown into the net, and the score was tied for the first time. China United, seeing this and feeling ambitious, tried to attack quickly, but Jingxiang's clever pass to Shijin, and "raw chicken boy" leaping forward, and shooting fiercely, was pushed out by Powell, diving to the ground, a good save.</p>
<p>After this, China United firmly grasped the offensive for the whole game. At 32 minutes, Shijin shot and hit the post, and Yongqiang headed the ball again, but it went over the crossbar, causing sighs to rise from the west. Before long, Songsheng launched a long-range powerful shot, but it missed again. At the last opportunity, Wenzhi shot fiercely from about ten yards away, but it was also saved by Powell. Thus, the first half ended in a draw.</p>
<p>Each Side Scores Twice</p>
<p>After the break, the Western Alliance launched a lightning attack. Gao Shannu lightly lifted the ball in front of the goal, but Liangde missed. Ihus took advantage of the air to head the ball. The ball fell in front of the goal, and Ford poked it in, and the Western Alliance took the lead.</p>
<p>Before long, the Western Alliance came back strong. Ford advanced quickly and crossed the ball. Ihus arrived with the ball and was sure to score, but Yaode took the risk of diving down and pushing the ball out, fortunately not failing.</p>
<p>At this time, China United's Jinhong, Wenzhi, and Shijin were injured in succession, while the Western Alliance's momentum was strong. China United's situation was dangerous, and everyone thought that it was sure to lose. After 30 minutes, the ball was kicked out and replaced with a new one. Jingxiang also switched positions with Yongqiang, and sure enough, the situation turned for the better.</p>
<p>At 36 minutes, "Magic Leg" got the ball and advanced, passing the ball out with a kick. The landing point was excellent. Yongqiang rushed in with the ball, knocked on the door fiercely, and the score was tied again, 2-2.</p>
<p>Each Side Scores Three Times at the End of the Game</p>
<p>In less than two minutes, Jingxiang, Wenzhi, and Shijin attacked together. Jingxiang lifted the ball to Wenzhi from a distance, and Wenzhi kicked it, but Powell rushed out to intercept it. Unexpectedly, Yongqiang flashed in and headed the ball into the net while lying on the ground. 3-2, the domestic fans cheered and shook Jia Shan. It seemed that the championship was secure, but who knew that in the last minute, Ford advanced straight from the border, bent at the baseline, and Ihus headed the ball in front of the goal. 3-3, the end of the game was a draw again. Who will win the cup? Wait for the third battle!</p>
<p>In this game, China United can be said to have avoided defeat when it should have lost, and failed to win when it should have won. It was truly a moment of joy and disappointment!</p>

<h3>American Woolen Manufacturer Keen to Have Constant Supply of Chinese Wool, How to Transport Stored Wool to Seaports is the Decisive Question</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the survey report of the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Team; in the development of China's wool industry, attention should be paid to the trade channels. The most important thing to restore China's dry wool export trade is to first investigate the existing wool reserves in various parts of the country, where they are stored, and how to find ways to transport them to the seaports. The key is to get the stored wool to the ports, so that normal trade can begin. American wool manufacturers are eagerly awaiting a constant supply of Chinese wool under the condition that it can compete with the price of carpet wool produced in other countries. American wool manufacturers are very fond of the advantages of Chinese wool. If the selling price is not too high compared to the wool prices of other countries, they are happy to purchase it. Wool, like other export commodities, must have a constant and continuous source to meet the needs of manufacturers. Nowadays, artificial wool has emerged, adding another strong enemy to carpet wool. However, the durability and applicability of artificial wool may not be as good as natural wool. Therefore, if high-quality, standard-compliant natural wool can be supplied regularly and in quantity, American manufacturers are still willing to buy it. The trade route for Chinese wool is long and difficult, which is expected in a country with transportation difficulties.</p>
<p>Investigation of Wool Reserves</p>
<p>According to the survey, the current reserves of wool, goat cashmere, and camel hair in China (excluding those produced in 1946 and those stored in the hands of small wool merchants and herders) are: 23 million pounds of wool, 750,000 pounds of goat cashmere, and 2.25 million pounds of camel hair.</p>
<p>In addition, according to the survey, the amount of wool available for exchange for goods in Qinghai and Ningxia provinces is: (The prices listed below are the market prices in September 1946.) Qinghai sheep wool: 11,800,000 pounds, priced at 551 yuan per pound in national currency, with a total value of 5,501,800,000 yuan. Ningxia spring wool: 2,750,000 pounds, priced at 910 yuan per pound, with a total value of 2,520,500,000 yuan. Ningxia autumn wool: 660,000 pounds, priced at 1,092 yuan per pound, with a total value of 783,200,200,000 yuan. Ningxia goat cashmere: 550,000 pounds, priced at 1,424 yuan per pound, with a total value of 5,260,000,000 yuan. Ningxia camel hair: 1,650,000 pounds, priced at 3,200 yuan per pound, with a total value of 9,286,420,000 yuan. The total amount of various wools is 5,610,000 pounds.</p>

<h3>Use of Production Loans Not Entirely Satisfactory</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The work of the Production Loan Inspection Team has largely been completed, and the materials obtained are currently being compiled and summarized. It is reported that Governor Zhang of the National Bank has also requested information from the team for research as a reference for future lending. Regarding the use of loans by various factories, there are several aspects that are worth improving. One is that some factories, after obtaining large loans, do not need to use all of them themselves, but lend a portion to other factories at high interest. Another is that some factories use production loans to repay [previous] debts instead of purchasing raw materials as agreed upon in the contract. There are many other aspects worth improving. In the future, the inspection team will submit concrete suggestions to the United Four Banks as a reference for future business.</p>
<h3>Raw Materials Expensive, Sales Stagnant, Silk Weaving Industry in Difficult Situation</h3>
<p>According to sources in the silk weaving industry: The current situation of the industry is precarious, bordering on a state of sales stagnation. Spring is originally the peak sales season for silk products, but since the beginning of this year, sales have not improved much. Moreover, raw materials are currently expensive, and costs are too high. If weaving or patterned goods can be maintained, weaving mass-market goods will inevitably lead to losses. However, there is no guarantee for the sales of either. At present, the industry is maintaining its original production for two reasons: one is to keep the machinery productive and avoid decay, and the other is that it is difficult to dismiss workers. However, this situation is unlikely to last. It is also said that the jointly formed silk weaving production and sales joint venture company is also in the same predicament. The export silk produced by the company has currently reached more than 8,000 bolts, all of which are available for export. Its products were originally targeted at India, but it has not been possible to develop this market to date. The main reason is that since the foreign exchange adjustment last month, Indian merchants have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, making it even more difficult for our silk weaving industry to be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Asks China Trust Bureau to Continue Purchasing Export Goods</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently received requests from various related parties to purchase export goods such as tea, wool, musk, and furs and medicinal materials from North China. In order to reverse the economic crisis in North China, the Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that the main reasons why it was previously impossible to promote the export of goods from various regions were that prices and freight rates were too high and the foreign exchange rate was too low. Now that the foreign exchange rate has been raised not long ago, it may be easier to promote transportation and export. The Rehabilitation Company, which was previously responsible for purchasing export goods, has had its business taken over by the Central Trust Bureau. Therefore, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has specifically written to the China Trust Bureau, requesting it to continue to handle the purchase and transportation together to assist in the recovery of the rural economy. It is reported that the China Trust Bureau has suggested lowering prices in the producing areas, and the United Four Banks have ordered the local provincial banks to handle the remittance of funds to Chongqing or Shanghai to facilitate merchants' operation and transportation. If it proceeds smoothly and the prices in the producing areas are appropriate, the China Trust Bureau will pay close attention to the foreign market prices and buyers at any time, and purchase as much as possible in Chongqing, Shanghai, or other important ports, and actively find ways to transport and sell them abroad. It is now reported that the Ministry of Finance has already instructed the relevant local banks to actively handle the remittance of funds for the export goods in question, taking into account the actual situation.</p>
<h3>China Sericulture Transformation and Development Still Under State Guidance</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to comply with the provisions of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, the China Sericulture Company plans to evaluate the value of its factories and issue shares in stages, so that they can gradually be transformed into private enterprises. Detailed measures are being drafted. According to relevant sources, the supervisory business of China Sericulture will still be retained, and the expenses will be borne by the state. The enterprise part will be sold to the private sector. The company currently has a total of seven factories, and its assets are estimated to be worth about 30 billion yuan. There are currently more than 10,000 employees, and a research institution will be established soon. In addition, the proposal submitted by the China Sericulture Company three weeks ago has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for a long time, but has not yet received approval due to the imminent government reorganization. If the purchase price of silkworms this year can take into account the cost of farmers, it is expected that the number of silkworms can reach 70,000 dan, of which 30,000 dan can be used for export.</p>
<h3>Prices of Domestically Produced Cloth and Cotton Textiles Decline in Singapore</h3>
<p>[Singapore News] The black market prices of cloth here are falling day by day. Cloth retailers in the Jalan Besar area have begun to sell Chinese cloth at low prices. Poplin is six cents per yard, and other domestic cloth is up to eight cents per yard. However, because there is less printed cloth, it has not yet been sold off. This batch of goods was shipped from Hong Kong, and the wholesale price is 14 yuan per piece of 28 yards, which is the lowest price in the city. Recently, because 12 million yards of Japanese cloth are about to arrive, the owners are eager to sell, and the price is 100% lower than last month. However, the prices of Italian cloth and British printed cloth have not fallen, and are still standing at about 2.5 yuan per yard. The prices of white twill and black cloth are higher than the official prices, about 2 cents per yard.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the government has formally announced that cotton textiles are allowed to be exported. Before cloth is exported to areas outside Malaya, exporters can apply to the government for an export permit. Previously, the authorities stipulated that each importer of cloth imported from Hong Kong could ship 25% of the imported quantity to the Gu District outside Malaya. Currently, the best-selling areas for cloth are Java, Borneo, and Sumatra. Due to the impact of Dutch ships, this road is quite stagnant. (According to the political agreement between the Netherlands and Indonesia, the two sides signed a contract on March 25th in Jakarta, and trade between Singapore and the Dutch East Indies should be active.)</p>
<h3>Export Price of Mexican Gold Coins Reduced</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 5th] According to reliable sources: From April 7th, the Bank of Mexico will reduce the export price of gold coins from $50.50 to about $49 per 50 pesos.</p>
<h3>Soybean Quantity Needed for Oil Extraction to Be Increased Again</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to Deputy Director Shen of the China Trust Bureau, Mayor Wu has consulted with President Zhang of the National Bank, hoping that the China Trust Bureau can regularly supply oil factories in the city with affordable soybeans to stabilize the market price of cooking oil. President Zhang has now telegraphed the Northeast to allocate another six thousand tons from the soybeans being purchased, to be shipped to Shanghai immediately. Together with the four thousand tons that have already arrived, there will be a reserve of ten thousand tons. As for whether the allocation will be regular or temporary, as well as the price and quantity at the time of distribution, these are currently under study, and a detailed plan will be announced within a day or two.</p>
<h3>Overview of Tea Production and Sales in Fujian</h3>
<p>As one of the six major tea-producing provinces in China, Fujian tea ranks first in the province's export trade. The tea-producing area in Fujian extends over more than 20 counties, covering an area of more than 500,000 acres, with more than 300,000 tea farmers and workers. Before the war, the annual output was more than 300,000 dan, and at its peak, it exceeded 400,000 dan. In the early days of the War of Resistance, the government encouraged increased production, and the output remained at 220,000 dan. After the start of the Pacific War, export sales plummeted, and domestic sales also became sluggish. From 1938 to 1945, the average annual output was only more than 40,000 dan. The speed of its decline is lamentable. According to statistics, last year's output was only 39,560 dan, which is equivalent to one-fifth of that of 1937. Fuzhou's total annual exports were only worth more than 9 billion 60 million, but it still ranks first in exports. Because of Fujian tea's unique climate and soil, and excellent varieties, in the past, exports were mainly black tea. For example, Fuding black tea and "Bai Hao Monkey" from eastern Fujian are especially favored by the American and London markets. Wuyi's famous "Shui Xian" also had the reputation of "Tea King" among foreigners, and its "Da Hong Pao" and "Bai Ji Guan" are even more popular delicacies. In the future, if sufficient loans are obtained to reduce costs and improve production technology, it should not be difficult to restore its glorious historical status.</p>
<h3>Postal Savings and Remittance Bureaus in Various Locations Adjust Operations; Zhengzhou Office Upgraded to Branch Bureau</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Since Mr. Gu Chunfan took over as the director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, he has spared no effort in rectifying the bureau's administrative facilities and employee discipline. In addition to finding ways to closely liaise with post offices to jointly seek the expansion of postal savings and remittance business, he has also carefully reviewed the business conditions of branch offices in various locations and adjusted them accordingly. It is now known that the Zhengzhou office of the bureau has a fairly developed business and will be upgraded to a savings and remittance branch in the near future. At the same time, the business of Shantou, Jiujiang, Ganzhou, Hengyang, Kaifeng, Luzhou and other branch offices is relatively逊色, and they have been demoted to offices to suit actual needs. In addition, more than a dozen branch offices and offices in Taishan, Meizhou, Shaoguan, etc., will be abolished. All savings and remittance business originally handled by these bureaus and offices will be transferred to local post offices for handling, in order to reduce expenses. After the adjustment in the future, there will be no hindrance to the needs of the local people.</p>
<p>Post Office Entrusted to Act as Treasury Agent</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] According to the Public Treasury Law, the State Treasury affairs should be handled by the Central Bank. However, because the Central Bank's postal network is widespread, most localities have entrusted post offices to act as State Treasury sub-branches. Since its implementation in November 1943, post offices currently have 845 State Treasury agencies, distributed in 21 postal districts, accounting for one-half of the total number of agency treasury agencies of various banks and bureaus in the country. This has made a great contribution to assisting the state in promoting treasury administration and facilitating people's payment of taxes. Recently, due to the frequent receipts and expenditures of the national treasury, in order to meet the needs of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, the post office intends to use its widely established agency treasury agencies. All locations with post offices but no State Treasury agencies are planning to be entrusted with agency treasury duties in order to achieve the goal of comprehensive agency treasury and complete a sound public treasury network.</p>
<p>In addition, since the implementation of the measures for depositing and remitting public funds of military and government agencies, the transfer and remittance of treasury funds by various agencies has been frequent and the amounts are large. The remittance capacity of the local agency treasury post offices was originally limited, which caused some difficulties in transferring treasury funds. Now, in order to facilitate the transfer and remittance of treasury funds by various agencies, the remittance capacity of each agency treasury post office has been increased as much as possible, and the original quota has been completely cancelled. In the future, if agencies transfer funds to local agency treasury post offices for account opening and expenditure, after this improvement, it will be greatly facilitated.</p>
<p>Preparatory Meeting of the Savings and Remittance Union</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The first preparatory meeting of the Savings and Remittance Union of the National Postal Workers' General Union was held at 9:00 a.m. on April 6 in the conference room of the union on Jiujiang Road, Shanghai. After reporting the significance of the meeting, more than ten proposals were discussed, and it was decided to convene the first National Congress in Shanghai in July of this year.</p>
<h3>Existing Inventory Available, No Problems in the Paper Market for the Time Being</h3>
<p>(Report from our newspaper) Yesterday, this reporter interviewed several publishers and paper merchants in the city about the current situation of the paper market after the restriction on paper imports. To sum up, due to the fact that domestic transportation has not returned to normal, it is difficult for publications to be sold in other places. At the same time, due to the widespread phenomenon of [omission], the current demand for paper, each company still has inventory to supply. In terms of sources, foreign merchants are willing to supply and sell, but due to restrictions, except for the number of quotas stipulated by the government, very few private goods are imported. The reason why the current paper market can remain stable is that each company relies on a small amount of existing inventory to supply. If the existing inventory is used up one day, the allocated paper will be limited, and the quality of domestic paper cannot be supplied continuously, then the severity of the paper shortage and the fluctuation of the paper market can be imagined.</p>
<h3>U.S. Oil Production</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 5th] For the week ending March 29, U.S. oil production averaged 4,865,000 barrels per day, compared to an average daily production of 4,862,000 barrels in the previous week, and an average daily production of 4,424,000 barrels in the same period in 1946.</p>
<h3>Dried Lily Bulbs Arrive</h3>
<p>The price of dried lily bulbs had risen by 20-30% previously due to scarcity. Now, dozens of packages of goods have arrived, and it is said that they have been released, with a small drop of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. However, merchants are receiving cash, the cost is relatively high, and they are unwilling to sell cheaply for the time being.</p>
<h3>Timber Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Lauan plywood continues to weaken, fir wood is still hovering around 50-60 yuan, and foreign pine is also trending downstream.</p>
<h3>New Ways for Overseas Chinese Remittances from Java</h3>
<p>[Singapore News] Merchants in Singapore and Java have recently been operating trade by transferring national currency. That is, the affiliated companies in Java handle the national currency remittance procedures, and then exchange the remitted funds for goods [omission], sell them through commercial channels, convert them into dollars, and remit them back to the country. This method indirectly connects overseas remittances when Sino-Dutch foreign exchange is blocked, which is beneficial to both public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Currently, the rate of national currency remittance by merchants is 4 Singapore dollars for 10,000 national currency, which is the exchange rate for remittances in Java. Then, the black market price of Singapore dollars against Nicaraguan cordobas is the standard for the local private remittance rate (currently, most private remittances in the area are 10,000 national currency, charging more than 20 Nicaraguan cordobas). From this, about 2 Singapore dollars can be obtained for every 10,000 national currency. It is said that there are already five companies operating this business. (According to the agreement signed in The Hague, trade control will be opened soon, and the Nicaraguan cordoba in Hong Kong has suddenly risen, and trade between Singapore and the Netherlands will be active, and the cloth market in Singapore and Hong Kong will also be energetic. The prosperity of this new way of overseas remittances may not last long.)</p>
<h3>Quantity of Indian Raw Cotton Exported up to the End of February This Year; Quota of 800,000 Bales between May and August</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Bombay, 5th] Minister of Commerce Chindleyka recently replied to questions in the Central Parliament stating that the quantity of raw cotton approved for export as of the end of February 1947 is as follows:</p>

<h3>Japan Under Control</h3>
<p>— Chen Xunyu</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>It has been a year and a half since the United Nations accepted Japan's surrender on September 2, 1945. Due to the lack of systematic news reports on the situation of Japan under control, people in the country have not gained a thorough impression. General MacArthur of the Allied Headquarters invited our country's reporters to visit in February of this year. After several rounds of negotiations, the Chinese Reporter Group to Japan, composed of ten reporters from major newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and other places, flew east on February 26. In addition to visiting Tokyo, Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka, Kobe, Hiroshima and other cities, they flew to Seoul, Korea on March 11, and returned to Tokyo on March 13. They returned to China on the 15th. The journey was thousands of miles, lasting 18 days, and the scope of the visit was quite extensive. The information obtained on Japan's military, political, financial, economic, cultural, educational, and wartime destruction under Allied control was abundant, and the impression was particularly deep. This reporter returned from Japan and specially wrote a series of articles on what he saw and heard, for the reference of those who are concerned about the Japanese issue.</p>
<p>Allied Policy and Organization</p>
<p>According to the Potsdam Declaration, there are two supreme guiding principles for the Allied management of Japan: (1) Negatively, to ensure that Japan no longer becomes an aggressive country that threatens world peace; (2) Positively, to make Japan a peaceful and democratic country forever.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the above two goals, the Allied powers decided to implement the following four guidelines: (1) Japan's sovereignty is limited to the Japanese mainland, namely Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and the small islands permitted by the United Nations; (2) Disarm Japan completely; (3) Enable the Japanese people to enjoy freedom of speech, publication, religion and assembly; (4) Develop a peaceful and self-sufficient economy.</p>
<p>The above four points were agreed upon by China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union at the time of Japan's surrender, and authorized Marshal MacArthur to be responsible for supervising and controlling Japan. In this decision, MacArthur has three privileges in Japan: (1) The power of supreme rule in Japan; (2) To take appropriate measures to implement Japan's surrender conditions and the Potsdam Declaration; (3) To issue orders and exercise the power of rule through his military government or the Japanese Emperor and the Japanese government; if the Supreme Commander believes that the personnel executing the order are not performing effectively, he can replace them immediately.</p>
<p>The above three points are the orders announced by US President Truman in Washington on September 22, 1945. This is enough to explain that MacArthur's authority was granted by the US government after being agreed by the Allied powers. On December 27 of the same year, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union decided to organize a Far Eastern Committee in Washington and establish an Allied Council for Japan in Tokyo at the Moscow Conference. The establishment of these two institutions did not substantially change MacArthur's powers. As far as the Far Eastern Committee is concerned, it is an guiding organization organized by representatives of eleven countries (China, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and the Philippines), but all its resolutions need to be passed through the US government and conveyed to MacArthur, and there is no direct relationship with MacArthur. In the US government, in order to implement the resolutions of the Far Eastern Committee, there are two committees, one of which is the State Department, War Department, Naval Department Combined Committee (SWNCC), which is an advisory body. All resolutions are discussed by the committee and then submitted to the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) for orders to MacArthur. The organization system is as follows:</p>
<p>As for the latter institution, it is composed of representatives from China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the chairman is US Ambassador Acheson. Its resolutions cannot directly bind MacArthur, and its role is only to provide opinions and serve as an advisory body. Therefore, the most direct and highest executor of the control of Japan is MacArthur. The Far Eastern Committee is theoretically the highest decision-making body.</p>
<p>The Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) is composed of MacArthur as the Supreme Commander, with a Chief of Staff under him, forming the General Staff Headquarters, which is divided into four groups: Personnel (G1), Intelligence (G2), Operations (G3), and Supply (G4). Four Deputy Chiefs of Staff concurrently serve as the directors of each group, which is essentially a staff organization. In addition, for the convenience of division of labor and cooperation, there are nine bureaus under the Chief of Staff, whose responsibilities are as follows: (1) Executive Section: Responsible for general affairs. (2) Diplomatic Section: Responsible for liaison between the United Nations representatives in Japan and individuals. (3) Government Section: Responsible for general civil affairs; Korean administration is also under the jurisdiction of this bureau. (5) Economic and Scientific Section: Responsible for economic, financial, industrial and trade affairs. (5) Natural Resources Section: Responsible for agriculture, forestry, fisheries and mining. (6) Public Relation Office: Responsible for information, publicity, public relations, etc., and opened a press room for news reporters. (7) Civil Information and Education Section: Responsible for news, broadcasting, film, education, religion, art facts, and its main task is to be responsible for the enlightenment of residents in the occupied area. (8) Civil Communication Section: Responsible for the restoration and reconstruction of communication facilities. (9) Public Health and Welfare Section: Responsible for medical administration and public health and welfare affairs. (10) Legal Section: Responsible for investigating and prosecuting war criminals. The organizational system is roughly as follows (Table 2):</p>
<p>The above departments are all located in Tokyo, while the military government is organized by the garrison in each local prefecture and county. Wherever the administrative organs of the Japanese government are located, there must be the establishment of the US military government. Its task is to urge the Japanese government to implement the orders of the Allied Headquarters, and it may correct those who fail to implement them effectively at any time. When the Allied Headquarters issues orders to the Japanese government, it simultaneously notifies the occupation forces. After receiving the orders, the Japanese government orders all levels of administrative agencies and informs the people to comply. After receiving the orders, the occupation forces notify the military government, the legal bureaus at all levels, and the local garrisons, and inform the Japanese people. If the Japanese central government fails to implement effectively, the General Staff Headquarters of the Allied Headquarters may directly correct it. If the local government and the people fail to implement effectively, the central government will urge them, or the court will bring them to justice. If necessary, troops can be dispatched to enforce it. The execution system is illustrated as follows (Table 3):</p>
<p>The advantage of this control method is that the Allied control agency and the Japanese political system are independent of each other, so there will be no confusion, this is one. The Japanese government directly manages the Japanese people, and the Allied forces are only responsible for issuing orders and supervising their implementation. This has a better impact on the Japanese people's perception, this is two. But its weakness also lies here: since the Allied agencies at all levels are not responsible for implementation, they cannot have a deep understanding of various technical problems. If the Japanese government and the people collude, it will not be easy to discover the malpractices. At the beginning of the occupation of Japan, the United States did not neglect this point, and the strengthening of the G2 intelligence organization is proof of this. However, as time goes on, the Japanese are good at flattering, and the Americans do not bear old grudges. Whether the orders of the Allied Headquarters can be thoroughly implemented without losing their original intention is worthy of close attention by the people of our country and the Allied countries.</p>
<h3>Track Laying Project on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Completes More Than 100 Kilometers in 44 Days</h3>
<p>— Quick News from March 20, sent by Huang Cen from Jinhua</p>
<p>From Zhuji to Jinhua, the track laying team of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Engineering Office completed the railway track laying project of 108 kilometers in 44 days.</p>
<p>Forty-four days is not a long time, and after excluding the days of spring rain, the actual "working days" are at most only thirty days. This time, they were able to create a new record of laying an average of more than three kilometers of track per day in such a "blitzkrieg" manner. In the middle of this, we cannot help but be surprised and admire the working spirit and technology of the track laying team.</p>
<p>Laboring Workers in Urgent Excitement</p>
<p>This reporter went to and from the vicinity of Jinhua Station this morning to observe the progress of the laying work.</p>
<p>The Jinhua Station gate, which had been deserted for five years, suddenly became lively today. Thousands of spectators stood densely beside the track, and more than 400 laboring workers came and went among them. Foremen and young engineers were excitedly helping to direct. At first, trucks drove by, dropping sleepers every foot, and the workers behind immediately put them in place and prepared for "compacting the soil". In the second step, the workers moved the steel rails from the dark material car, quickly placed them on the pulley car, and pushed them along the track. In the third step, the steel rails were unloaded and connected to the previous section. The fourth step was to start the necessary and piecemeal work such as "knocking nails", "tightening screws", "measuring distance" and "filling soil". The process of connecting section by section was faster than the "pacing" of ordinary gentlemen. The workers were full of a harmonious and joyful atmosphere. In today's China, which is so backward and does not seek efficiency in everything, we are so moved and gratified to see the hardworking and practical spirit of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway employees!</p>
<p>Jinhua Lanxi to Connect Tracks Soon</p>
<p>With the introduction of Engineer Cheng Junzerun of the road construction office, I visited the office of the nailing team attached to the front of the locomotive. Several engineers who had just graduated from university lived in a small carriage. They were young and full of enthusiasm for their work. They competed to tell the story of the record-breaking progress, and pointed out various statistical tables hanging on the wall for the reporter to see, including "Nailing Log", "Cumulative Table of Workers", "Progress Speed Statistics Table", etc. They started nailing the road on February 1. Zhuji is (64+100) kilometers from Hangzhou. According to this calculation, it reached Waichen (74+100) on the 5th, Piantou (81+170) on the 10th, Anhua (87+657) on the 14th, Zhengjiawu (94+672) on the 18th, Dachen (99+164) on the 19th, Suxi (107+990) on the 23rd, and Yiwu (119+191.80) on the 27th. (According to Yiwu to Hangzhou, it has been opened to traffic on March 4, with two shifts a day). The Huajin section started laying tracks on March 1, Yizhen (133+351.75) on the 5th, Hangcixi (139+230) on the 9th, Xiaoshun (146+408) on the 11th, Tangya (156+987) on the 13th, and Jinhua at 4 pm on the 16th. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line has laid nearly 172 li of track from Hangzhou to here. It is expected that the entire line can be laid to Quzhou in June and connected to the Jiangqu section. It can be fully opened to traffic around the Double Tenth Festival. Jinhua to Lanxi will start pressing the tracks immediately, and it is said that it can be completed by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Under Repair, Photo Sent by Huang Cen</p>
<p>The Damage to the Bushanxi Bridge on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway (Sent by Our Reporter Huang Xingtian)</p>
<p>The Chief Engineer Spends Painstaking Effort</p>
<p>Director and Chief Engineer Hou Jiayuan arrived here on the 14th under a grand welcome, and immediately returned to Quzhou on the 15th to inspect. When mentioning Director Hou, everyone still remembers the touching experience of driving the locomotive himself and advancing one li while repairing and laying the Xiang-Gui Railway. When he took over the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway again this time, he still did it with this spirit. Some time ago, some people had a quarrel with Director Hou for some reason, and even went to Beijing to petition, etc. However, these rumors could not match his hard-working spirit after all. Why was the progress of the project delayed for more than a year after the victory, but it was completed so quickly after he took over? It can be seen that the fact will always defeat rhetoric. Today, who does not admire this engineer who has devoted himself to the railway engineering of the motherland?</p>
<p>The Leader of the Track Laying Team is Highly Meritorious</p>
<p>Tang [omission] Ru, the leader of the track laying team, graduated from Tangshan and has worked in the railway for several years. This time his contribution is also not small. Under his command, it is divided into four sections: engineering, machinery, dispatch, and material, which are respectively responsible by Lu Xiguang, Yuan Xiaozuo, Qian Guangzhao, and Huang Jialin. He said that when nailing the Xiang-Gui Railway in the past, the highest record was only a little more than three kilometers in 24 hours. This time, sleepers were thrown at night and work was done during the day, but more than half of the working days exceeded three kilometers. It was especially fast in the days before reaching Jinhua. On March 12, it reached 4.2 kilometers, breaking the historical record of nailing roads in China. The efficiency was around 4 kilometers on the 15th and 16th. This kind of work efficiency was beyond their expectations. They especially admire the working workers. Except for a few skilled workers, the rest were temporarily recruited. However, when guiding them to use their skills, they were also very familiar and smooth. In order to reward the workers, the bureau formulated reward regulations. The base number for 90-pound rails is 2.5 kilometers per day, and wages are increased proportionally if this is exceeded. For example, on March 12, the reward rate was exactly 100%, and everyone was paid double that day. Since March, the average daily reward for workers has been more than 50%. At present, the wages of skilled workers are from 10,000 to 13,000, and the wages of unskilled workers are from 7,000 to 9,000. If there is no such addition, their lives would still be difficult.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is now awakening. This is a trunk line that serves as the lifeline of the five southeastern provinces, not only Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces. In the future, after the Nanchang section is extended to Zhuzhou and connected to the Yuehan Railway, combining the Pinghan, Pingjin, Jinpu, Jinghu, and Huhu lines, wouldn't this large triangle area become the center of everything in the motherland?</p>
<p>No Beginning and No End, Starting a New Journey</p>
<p>The engineers came from different corners (Beiyang, Jiaoda, Tangshan, Xiamen, Yingda...). When they saw the last rail nailing at the station, they were so happy that they burst into tears. The workers shook off the burden, and when they pushed the last rail loading truck to the end, they sang:</p>
<p>"Come on, push, use your strength... (The foreman sings) Hang Yu: (Chorus) Help, work together (The foreman sings) Hang Yu...</p>
<p>One step, be careful not to trip, Hang Yu...</p>
<p>Okay, shout, let's go to the movies tonight, Hang Yu..."</p>
<p>The end is the starting point, and they will start a new project tomorrow! I hope that the spirit of the nailing team employees will remain in the days to come. We have reason to believe that in China, as long as every project has such efficiency, the Stakhanov spirit will eventually emerge in China.</p>
<h3>A Youth from Changchun, Chen Fuhan, Commits Suicide, Leaving Tears of Sorrow for the Times</h3>
<p>— A Dispatch from Changchun, the 23rd, by Air Mail — Our Reporter Tang Zhan</p>
<p>A suicide case that shocked the entire city occurred in Changchun. The protagonist was Chen Fuhan, a staff member of Changchun Youth Middle School, originally an artilleryman of the 207th Division of the Youth Army, and a native of Xikang. Last year, he came to the Northeast with the army. In June, he was wounded in battle in Heishi Town, Panshi County, breaking his right leg. This year, he took a position at Youth Middle School. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 20th of this month, he committed suicide by taking poison in his dormitory. The next morning, the cook discovered him while delivering breakfast. He was rushed to the Municipal First Hospital for emergency treatment, but due to severe poisoning, he died. He left behind a suicide note and a letter to a friend in Changchun. The suicide note read: "The affairs of the nation are withering, the mountains and rivers are being destroyed, corruption fills the roads, and malfeasance is rampant. The people are constantly hungry and cold, and the soldiers have no moment of rest. The family fortune is declining day by day, and the body is severely injured. We cannot use swift action to save this turbulent situation; we cannot but sigh deeply. Occupying a position without performing useful work, I feel that I am wasting public funds; lacking the ability to contribute, I am hindering national reconstruction even more. Thinking late at night, my heart is filled with anxiety. I have already made the greatest sacrifice for the country and the nation, but I regret that I could not die on the battlefield. I am deeply ashamed that I have failed to live up to the inspiring and great personality of our leader and have failed to live up to the spirits of the martyrs and the late Premier in heaven. Alas! It is over! My death will be scorned by most people, but I do not wish for any criticism from the press. I have suffered such pain today for the sake of the country and the people, which is not something that ordinary, mediocre, and incompetent people can casually judge. My conscience is clear, and I can close my eyes in peace. On the eve of my death, I write this to clarify my thoughts. Written by Chen Fuhan in the dormitory of Changchun Youth Middle School on the evening of March 20th, the thirty-sixth year of the Republic, at nine o'clock."</p>
<p>Regarding the reasons for Chen Fuhan's suicide, many commentators believe that he was so saddened by the times and worried about the country that he committed suicide by drawing his own blood. There were no other special reasons. Chen's friends said that he was upright and unyielding, full of enthusiasm, and had a strong sense of justice. He got along very well with his superiors and classmates in the army.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Los Angeles Tuberculosis Sanatorium</h3>
<p>— Tidbits from Ding Huikang's Visit to America — A Dispatch from San Francisco by Air Mail on March 24th by Yuan Cha</p>
<p>Dr. Ding Huikang, Director of the Shanghai Hongqiao Sanatorium, traveled to the United States on the General Gordon in January of this year to study the latest medical and public health practices. After landing in San Francisco, he met with Dr. Geiger, Director of the Health Bureau, who told him that smallpox had been discovered there a few months ago. Dr. Geiger immediately ordered vaccinations, and the entire city, with a population of approximately 800,000, was completed within two weeks. Dr. Ding expressed his deep appreciation for the rapid implementation of health administration. In early February, he arrived in Los Angeles, a newly emerging metropolis in the southwestern United States. Its area is about the size of Belgium, and the city's vastness ranks first in the world, with a population of approximately 1.8 million. Upon the invitation of the local Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Dr. Ding visited the Los Angeles Tuberculosis Sanatorium, which is located 27 miles from the city and covers 800 acres. It adopts a segregated village system, with each room accommodating only one to two people. The nurses' room and each patient's room have direct communication, saving time and providing convenience. Patients do not pay fees and are supported through donations. Recently, three Russian soldiers were admitted to the sanatorium, with the Russian government donating $5,000 for their care. The sanatorium is located at the foot of Mount Wilson, offering extremely beautiful scenery. The sanatorium also has facilities such as a workshop, a library, and a chapel. The Olive View Sanatorium, located 25 miles from the city and covering 1,000 acres, is the third-largest tuberculosis sanatorium in the United States. Medical conferences are held once a week, and it can accommodate 1,000 beds. The sanatorium is famous for its surgery. For patients with cavities, a thoracoplasty can be performed, or even the entire lung can be removed. In one recent case, the procedure was performed five days ago, taking seven and a half hours, and the patient is now out of danger. Significant improvement can be seen on X-ray images. One-third of the patients at this sanatorium are Mexican, demonstrating the connection between environment and tuberculosis. The Municipal Hospital is one of the newest buildings in the city, with 18 floors and a capacity of 3,000 patients, making it the largest municipal hospital in the world. It has over 200 physicians and serves as an academic research institution. Dr. Ding observed that the hospitals in major cities in the United States are always full of patients because early treatment allows people to recover their health and working ability more easily. This is in stark contrast to the Chinese practice of waiting until the illness is critical before seeking hospital care. Due to advances in diagnostic methods, the United States has found that heart disease is the leading cause of death, while tuberculosis is the leading cause of death among young people aged 15 to 30. If this is the case in the United States, which has excellent environmental hygiene, then the seriousness of heart and lung diseases in China needs no further discussion. If everyone could have a health checkup every year, it would certainly improve the health of the nation. Note: In 1935, Dr. Ding was sent by the National Health Administration to various European countries to investigate tuberculosis prevention facilities. Since returning to China, he has spared no effort in promoting public health, such as school health checkups and X-ray tuberculosis screenings. Dr. Ding has transitioned from a private physician to engaging in practical public health work. He has been extremely busy visiting medical experts in the United States, such as Dr. Thomson, an authority on heart disease, and Mr. Cade, an X-ray expert. He is expected to visit medical centers in New York in mid-May before returning to China.</p>

<h3>The Current Mission of Young Technicians and Health Workers</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zukang</p>
<p>At the anniversary celebration of the founding of the Chinese Technology Association, Chairman Song Mingshi asked me to give a speech. On the spur of the moment, I offered three points based on my thoughts to encourage my colleagues in the Association. Upon returning home, I further expanded and wrote this article for the reference of young technical personnel in China.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Science Society of China thirty years ago demonstrated the Chinese intellectual class's understanding of science. The establishment of the Chinese Institute of Engineers during the war indicated the Chinese people's understanding of engineering, emphasizing the practical application of knowledge. And the establishment of the Technology Association last year further demonstrated our country's understanding of technology. From science to engineering is a transition from theory to practice. From engineering to technology is a transition from a partial application of knowledge to a general application. This represents the progress of the Chinese people in understanding and utilizing Western culture.</p>
<p>The current turbulent and unstable situation in the country, and the difficulty of finding opportunities for us technicians, are indeed disheartening. But I want to loudly appeal to my country's young technical personnel to never lose heart or become discouraged, but rather to redouble their efforts. The special mission we bear at present, which can also be said to be the attitude and spirit we should have, should be threefold: first, "application"; second, "pursuit of truth"; and third, "martyrdom."</p>
<p>The purpose of studying is to apply what one has learned. Technical personnel are all specialists with specialized knowledge. Thanks to the cultivation of the country, the support of their families, and their own efforts, they have acquired specialized knowledge, which is no easy feat. We must use what we have learned, as this is the way to achieve the highest efficiency. Therefore, although the general situation in the country is unstable, the environment may not be entirely satisfactory, the treatment of technical personnel may not be high, and the opportunities to demonstrate their abilities may not be many, I want to advise young technical personnel to stick to their posts and do their best in whatever situation they find themselves. Everyone should use what they have learned in any situation; this is the primary meaning of application.</p>
<p>Last year, at a meeting of the Academia Sinica, a certain dignitary gave a speech calling for "returning politics to the people and returning science to scientists." However, a certain science magazine criticized this, arguing that it should be said "returning scientists to science." But I believe that both sayings are valid. Because there are many scientific or technological enterprises in the country that are not managed by scientific or technical personnel, and those who study science and technology do not all engage in scientific or technological work in their respective fields. Both of these should be corrected. This responsibility lies with the government and the founders of these enterprises. I hope that leaders at all levels in the political, economic, and cultural circles of the country can ensure that "returning technology to technical personnel" and "returning technical personnel to technology" will enable all undertakings to be managed properly and developed. This is the secondary meaning of application.</p>
<p>In the current difficult environment, all enterprises feel a shortage of financial and material resources. Young technical personnel should strive to promote and expand their undertakings in difficult circumstances. We must conserve materials and manpower, which means being able to "adapt to local conditions" and "adapt to available materials." For example, Shanghai imports hard asphalt for repairing asphalt road surfaces, but it is not easy to obtain. We must find ways to adapt to local conditions and try to use soft asphalt (Coal Tar) as much as possible. The soft asphalt in Shanghai is not entirely suitable for road repair, so we must formulate standards (Specifications) to guide the factories to refine it accordingly. This is adapting to available materials. There are many other similar situations. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, many precedents were set for engineering projects in the rear, such as highways and railways, bridges designed and assembled on-site, and the manufacture of military equipment and chemical production. This is the third meaning of application in the current circumstances.</p>
<p>Next, I would like to talk about the pursuit of truth. Truth is truth. The term "technology" is considered "Technology" in English, but in English, it is also referred to as "Applied Science," which is translated into Chinese as "应用科学" (Yingyong Kexue), meaning applied science. However, some people believe that "实学" (Shi Xue), meaning practical learning, is a more appropriate translation for "Technology." Moreover, according to some scientists in the West, the term "Applied Science" is also inappropriate because practical learning is not merely the "art" of applying the principles and methods of one or more sciences to an undertaking; it also has its own theory. For example, water supply engineering is the result of the integration and application of various sciences such as hydraulics, hydrology, chemistry, and geology. However, it must also develop its own design theory. For example, the design of water supply systems, so "Technology" is not only the "study" of theory, but also the "application" - applied learning - but it is not only the art - technology - but also a kind of "study". Therefore, those who study applied learning (technology) in our country at present should, in addition to application, also be able to pursue truth. Seeking truth is learning, is the attitude of a scientist. Only when we have the spirit of pursuing truth can we make inventions, can we make applied learning a genuine applied learning. For example, civil engineers design culverts on roads using the Talbot formula. This formula is only suitable for a part of the United States. It is an empirical formula. In our country, it is best to establish our own formula based on our own experience. This is the pursuit of truth, and truth can lead to application, which is applied learning.</p>
<p>Truth is also "reality." The pursuit of truth is to be practical. Perfunctoriness, superficiality, and aiming too high are all impractical and cannot be considered to have the spirit of pursuing truth. Chinese scholars have a common problem, which is that when asked about practical work, they invariably "bluff their way through"; but when asked about theoretical plans, they are extremely profound and ambitious. One reason for this is that the majority of Chinese people lack the health and energy of Westerners, are reluctant to do practical work, and tend to indulge in abstract thinking. Another reason is the traditional habits of an agricultural society, which lack precise and meticulous training. We only need to look at the way most people use cars. Most people do not pay attention to when to add lubricating oil or what the tire pressure should be. Many drivers take it lightly. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, when public buses broke down in the middle of the road, belts could be used to replace fan belts, and straw sandals could be used as part of the steel plates. I think this kind of situation only happened in our country. This is all due to a lack of emphasis on truth, which is fundamentally contrary to the spirit of industrial revolution with its emphasis on efficiency and mass production. We must resolutely correct this. This is another aspect of pursuing truth.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about martyrdom. What is martyrdom? Martyrdom is sacrificing one's life, and the Way is a moral belief. The ancients said, "A greedy person dies for wealth, and a martyr dies for fame." Wealth is not worth pursuing, and fame is also empty. The Way is the noblest path of human behavior. - The Way is the path. Those who study technology should take the principles and methods of science - "learning" - and the cause of national and public welfare - "application" - as their goal, their path, and their belief, their Way. For the sake of this "learning" and this "application," they are willing to sacrifice profit, sacrifice fame, sacrifice everything, and even sacrifice their lives if necessary. This is martyrdom.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have often had the feeling that the spirit of Confucianism in our country should be integrated with the spirit of Western Christianity in modern times. Confucianism has an attitude and ambition towards the Way and towards the nation and society: "When poor, cultivate oneself alone; when successful, benefit all under heaven." Zhuge Kongming's saying "Safeguard one's life in troubled times, and do not seek fame and fortune among the feudal lords" has the same meaning. I believe this spirit should be revised. Furthermore, the set of learning and practice mentioned in the Great Learning - cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world - inevitably leads to the bad habit of many students thinking of themselves as future leaders as soon as they enter school. In Christianity, it seems that it is not like that. Christ's teachings are equality, fraternity, freedom, service, and sacrifice, which are in serious conflict with the power of Roman politics and the beliefs of the Jews at that time. Therefore, he did not hesitate to sacrifice his life, carrying the cross to his death at the young age of thirty-two. This spirit of ethics, morality, economy, politics, and revolution has had a profound and far-reaching impact on Western culture. As for our Confucianism, although Confucius also spoke of working before eating and laboring before enjoying benefits, it is often ignored by ordinary scholars with leadership aspirations. Therefore, I feel that we should promote the spirit of service, the spirit of sacrifice - the spirit of revolution.</p>
<p>Two months ago, the newspaper reported that the American Ambassador to China, Mr. Stuart, gave a speech to students, as if advocating that our country still needs a revolution, which is a revolution of freedom and democracy. His meaning probably refers to a revolution of freedom and democracy in thought, which is exactly what I envision. However, add to it a revolution of the scientific spirit. "When poor, cultivate oneself alone?" That's not right. When poor, we need a revolution. What we need most is a revolution of thought, and technical personnel should shoulder this responsibility.</p>
<p>Let's look at European history again. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Crusades launched seven expeditions to the east for the purpose of preserving the holy city of Jerusalem. Its driving force was religious zeal. By the 16th and 17th centuries, such outstanding figures as Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton overthrew Ptolemy's geocentric theory and proved heliocentrism, creating a new cosmic system. Even Galileo, at the old age of sixty-nine, was able to resist the church of the time, which was superstitious and clung to the old theories. Although he was forced to submit in the end, according to historical records, when he was forced to kneel before ten cardinals in crimson robes and finally renounced his theory, he muttered to himself as he crawled up, "And yet it moves!" From this, we can see his spirit of martyrdom. If young technical personnel can devote themselves to technological endeavors throughout their lives, taking the pursuit of national prosperity and public welfare as their responsibility, do so themselves, and encourage others to do so as well, remaining unmoved by poverty or lowly status, uncorrupted by wealth and high position, and unyielding in the face of force, that spirit is the spirit of martyrdom. Being able to recognize this responsibility is being able to take it as a mission. In short, young technical personnel of the present day - those in their twenties and thirties - should understand that the opportunity for national revival and the responsibility for national revitalization in ten or twenty years rest on your shoulders. You must hold yourselves accountable, respect yourselves, learn from your past mistakes, and redouble your efforts. To overcome the environment and create an era, you must shoulder the three missions I have mentioned above: first, application; second, pursuit of truth; and third, martyrdom. You must be based on the attitude of pursuing truth with science, aim for the cause of practical application, and uphold the spirit of martyrdom in order to shoulder the mission entrusted to you by the nation and the people. Then the future of our China will certainly be one hundred and twenty points bright!</p>

<h3>Buying and Selling</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiahua</p>
<p>She is that kind of "always anxious to be the first to try the new product" person. Whenever a hawker shouts outside the door in a hoarse voice, she will start "making a fuss" as if she is rushing to get things done. Perhaps she does not even understand what the hawker is selling, but her nervous anxiety, as if she is afraid of not being able to buy anything, is enough to make people laugh.</p>
<p>Each time when a hawker complies with the landlady's "summons" and steps through the door, the landlady seems to be meeting an old friend. She will warmly ask him about all sorts of things, such as where he comes from and where he is going. If it is evening or lunchtime, she will greet him with a big smile and invite him to eat or sleep at her house. Her words are nothing more than:</p>
<p>"Hey, businessman, have a simple meal here; it's about time."</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>"It's so late; you can stay here for the night. Hotels are too expensive."</p>
<p>However, most hawkers refuse the landlady's kindness. If there has ever been an exception, it was the old woman selling chicken eggs, because the landlady often says this to show her sincerity:</p>
<p>"It's nothing. The old woman who sold chicken eggs stayed here for a night last time."</p>
<p>This can be said to be the landlady's opening line to start the buying and selling. What follows in an hour is the discussion of the price.</p>
<p>The landlady's bargaining often surprises the hawkers, because the landlady has her own "business philosophy," which is "cutting the price in half." She feels that the hawkers who come to her door charge a particularly high price, so it is okay to bargain lower.</p>
<p>If the hawkers realize that arguing is useless because the offer is too low and prepare to leave, then she will grab their burden. Needless to say, her smile is gone, and her face has turned green.</p>
<p>"Why are you leaving? This is bargaining. You can still negotiate!"</p>
<p>If the hawker's price is three, five hundred, or even one or two thousand, the landlady will still refuse to buy, but she will shout:</p>
<p>"You are not sacred! So inflexible, insisting on one price."</p>
<p>However, most hawkers step back because of her excessive entanglement. Finally, the landlady happily strokes her black and thick fingers on her nose, expressing her joy. The subsequent dispute is about the quantity of the goods. For example, she might complain that his scale is not an old catty (斤), but only ten taels (兩), and demand that he add a little more.</p>
<p>Thus, because the hawker suffers too much loss, he cannot help but curse a few times, saying "such a woman, such a woman." The landlady then turns red in the face, shouting fiercely, almost like screaming:</p>
<p>"Hehe, losing money! Not making money? The devil sent you to my door? Really black-hearted."</p>
<p>Even though she says this, her joy because of the cheap price is still visible. She often tells every tenant living in her house about the things she bought, as if they were trophies she has won. She not only wants the tenants to know that she has bought such lovely things, but also wants someone to praise them as "bargains."</p>
<p>If you just smile and do not respond when she asks you, then she will point her ink-black finger at your nose and start scolding:</p>
<p>"Are you saying these things are expensive? Why are you silent?" If your reply says that these things are exceptionally cheap and that you also like them, then she will not be able to close her mouth, and her face will be covered with countless wrinkles as she says with a smile:</p>
<p>"Really? Really?"</p>
<p>The landlady is such a fickle woman, loving to laugh, loving to cry, loving to scold, and being both fierce and aggressive. She may consider you a "good person," but within a few minutes, she will immediately treat you as an enemy.</p>
<p>If you want to understand her character further, readers, let me tell you a recent story:</p>
<p>After noon, the landlady called the hawker selling chickens.</p>
<p>This hawker was around forty years old, dressed in rural attire. The two chickens were large and round, walking behind the landlady.</p>
<p>"Ah, listening to your accent, you are!"</p>
<p>"I am from Shaoxing," the hawker replied.</p>
<p>"Haha, we are from the same hometown! We are from Yuyao, but we only came to Hangzhou recently," the landlady immediately appeared very friendly and started talking, quietly and slowly answering.</p>
<p>Thus, the landlady and the hawker started talking. They got along very well, and the landlady even poured a cup of tea for him herself. She said:</p>
<p>"We are from the same hometown, drink this." The hawker who had been standing immediately sat down on the stone bench, smiling as he accepted the tea.</p>
<p>They talked about the situations in Shaoxing and Yuyao, and also about doing business. They spoke of many things, and the atmosphere became more and more harmonious.</p>
<p>"How much for a pair, fellow townsman?" the landlady asked, appearing anxious.</p>
<p>"To be honest, 9,000 for one to a fellow townsman."</p>
<p>"Oh, too expensive! We're fellow townsmen, let’s make it 10,000 a pair. It is easy to remember and easy to calculate," the landlady said, immediately squatting down and using her black and large hand to grab the chickens in the basket.</p>
<p>The hawker smiled bitterly, because this bargaining had disappointed him. She offered 10,000 when he said 18,000, virtually cutting the price in half. This loss was too great, so he very humbly said:</p>
<p>"Landlady, let's make it 16,000 a pair. Fellow townsmen don't make any money."</p>
<p>"11,000 a pair is good. Four chickens, 20,000, clear as day."</p>
<p>"30,000 for four, I'll give you another 2,000 for friendship, to cover your travel expenses," the hawker said pleadingly.</p>
<p>But no matter what the hawker said, the landlady insisted on 11,000 a pair. She said:</p>
<p>"You, person, are stubborn to the end, not willing to budge at all."</p>
<p>"Really—"</p>
<p>The hawker had not finished speaking, but the landlady had already lost her temper, because she had mistaken "really" for "losing money". She threw the chicken down, stood up, and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Losing money? Bullshit! Are you a rich man?" "It's precisely because I'm not a rich man—" the hawker replied timidly, as if sensing that something unfortunate was about to happen.</p>
<p>"If you are not a rich man, what foul money are you losing?"</p>
<p>"Then—" The hawker gave a bitter laugh, intending to leave.</p>
<p>"You can't leave. I want to buy them. Why are you insisting on one price? 30,000, 30,000!"</p>
<p>"Sorry, landlady!" The hawker trembled, glancing back as he left. But the landlady revealed an angry expression, rolled up her sleeves, and with a jump, rushed forward and dragged the burden with all her might.</p>
<p>"There's no reason for this. Why won't you sell?" she shouted.</p>
<p>The hawker's face turned red, and he was shaking extremely badly, looking very scared. Preparing to escape, he pulled hard, and in this way, the landlady, who was dragging the burden, fell down.</p>
<p>Then everything went out of control. The landlady forgot that the hawker was from the same hometown, was one of her own people, and started shouting, seemingly crying:</p>
<p>"You hit people! You dare to hit people! To the police station! To the police station!"</p>
<p>The hawker wanted to escape, but the landlady grabbed him, and even gave him a slap.</p>
<p>In the midst of the struggle, a patrolman ran in from outside. Thus, with tears and shouts, the landlady reported to the patrolman, "This thug, this robber!" The hawker was then taken to the police station.</p>
<p>Later, it was said that the hawker, as the "thug" and "robber," was sentenced to two months of imprisonment, but because a distant uncle of his, who served as the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, came out to vouch for him, he was only "locked up" for two days before being released.</p>
<p>And the landlady had already acquired six chickens, one of which was entirely black and extremely lively. The landlady fed them green grass and yellow millet every day, and whenever a kite appeared in the sky, she would shout, "May you be killed a thousand times, may you be killed ten thousand times! My family's chickens are not for you to eat!" As for where she bought these chickens and how much she spent in total, readers, please forgive my ignorance, I cannot know.

<p>How beautiful are the flowers along the banks of the Duren River!</p>
<p>How can you birds be so cheerful and sing,</p>
<p>While my heart is filled with sorrow!</p>
<p>You tear at my heart, beautiful bird,</p>
<p>As you sing on the branch;</p>
<p>You remind me of those happy days,</p>
<p>When my beloved had not yet changed her heart.</p>
<p>You tear at my heart, beautiful bird,</p>
<p>As you sing beside your mate;</p>
<p>For I, too, once sat like this,</p>
<p>Unknowing of my fate.</p>
<p>I often strolled beside the beautiful copper bank,</p>
<p>Watching the honeysuckle intertwine,</p>
<p>Every bird sang of its love,</p>
<p>And I, too, once sang of mine.</p>

<h3>Adipose Tissue of Literature</h3>
<p>— Jin Hong</p>
<p>The tendency of novels toward "looseness" has almost become a general fashion in the mid-20th century. Sinclair Lewis's *Main Street* is considered good because its chapters are well-organized, and the descriptions are full of vitality. Pearl Buck's *The Good Earth*, however, is somewhat like that. There are two main simple reasons for this trend: First, it is nothing more than the old realism style since the end of the 19th century, which often overemphasizes refinement, forming a habit of dense chapters and sentences, making readers shy away from masterpieces. Second, the psychology of literature is gradually changing. In the past, many readers often believed that the seriousness of the ideas and content of a work was inviolable, as if it could truly point out a direction for life. Now it is different. Its lightness is its advantage. Its emptiness is its way of sowing a seed of "self-cleverness" in the reader's mind.</p>
<p>A critic said:</p>
<p>"No matter how precise the imagination presented in a work, it is ultimately just the success of the author's personal imagination. It may not necessarily represent 'truth.' 'Truth' is not something that can be obtained through mere imagination. It must pass through the author's vision, be hidden in the depths of memory, and then be used as a resource for 'imaginative recreation' in the future to be artistically valid."</p>
<p>This statement has some truth to it. As the old saying goes, "Judging the fatness or thinness of the Yue people from the perspective of the Qin people" is not to blame for the irrelevance.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yutang seems to understand this as well. His *Moment in Peking*, though called a novel, is essentially a prose work in a loose style. However, most readers praise it. Not to mention Mr. Yu Cai's works. Is this natural and unrestrained habit of not pursuing "refined to the extreme" different from person to person? Or is it that the principle of description should not be contrary to "nature" in the first place?</p>
<p>Another English writer contemporary with Mr. Lin Yutang, Lin Wen-zheng (Lim Boon Keng), became famous both at home and abroad twenty years ago with his book *The Tragedy of Eastern Life* (Commercial Press edition). His style is much more rigorous than Mr. Yu Tang's, the descriptions are delicate, and the narration is fluent. Even a native English or American writer would not deny it. There are also some very loose sentence structures interspersed in the tightly structured chapters, such as "Malays and Chinese often talk very intimately, showing tolerance for each other in their living habits. The family is prefixed with the title 'Towkay' (Malays call gentlemen 'Towkay'), which is common in Chinese; it is equivalent to 'Mister' and 'Miss' in English. Therefore, Malays always add Towkay to the Chinese respectful address…" (Chapter 1, P. 4)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>"…In this narrative, we assume that readers know Towkay. Peng Abe is equivalent to Mister Abe Peng, because Chinese surnames are often placed at the beginning, followed by the personal name, just like guiding it." (Chapter 1, P. 5)</p>
<p>This kind of narration is, of course, lively, and interspersed after a description, it can greatly relax the reader's mind. Psychologically, it is justifiable. It is not showing off, nor is it making jokes. It is a bit like the fat accumulated on a person's body, which can increase the beauty of the skin. Is it the beauty of a refined and solid physique? Or is it beautiful to have a layer of adipose tissue inside the limbs? People's appreciation varies. Some like to read serious works that are described without a single flaw, while others like works with a loose and natural style. Which preference is more desirable? Who can determine!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 310</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"Oh! Does China have such an organization?" Tsurumi was surprised and very excited.</p>
<p>"Yes, Captain." Zheng Yan straightened his posture and lowered his voice. "The 'disappearance' incident a few days ago was also handled single-handedly by that friend entrusted by his subordinates!"</p>
<p>"Ha…" Tsurumi was happy. Just as he was about to ask further, the maid came.</p>
<p>"The news is not very good!" The maid looked worried. "The embassy said that Miss Nakamura did go to the embassy, but it was too early, 8:45. The office was not open. Only a small clerk received her. Miss Nakamura said she wanted to see the ambassador and retrieve a letter. The letter was important, and she had to retrieve it herself. The clerk asked Miss Nakamura to go again at 9:30. Miss promised to go at 9:30 or 10:00. The ambassador waited until 10:00, but Miss Nakamura did not go. Only then did the ambassador send someone to seal the letter."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Tsurumi glanced at the envelope of the document on the table:</p>
<p>"What car did Miss take?"</p>
<p>"The steward of the embassy called a car for a business trip, probably from 'Heta Car Rental Company'."</p>
<p>"Very good… Please tell the steward that I want to go to the military department. But I still want the car that Miss took, and I still want that driver. No one else!"</p>
<p>These successive events made Tsurumi feel a little confused.</p>
<p>"This time, I have to make a big mess!" Tsurumi seemed to be talking to himself. "I expected that something big must have happened to Pingzi." He indicated that he was going to make a fuss in Shanghai.</p>
<p>"Yes, Captain, but you don't have to worry. Maybe Miss Nakamura was delayed by an important matter at that secret meeting?" Zheng Yan comforted Tsurumi in this way.</p>
<p>"No." Tsurumi seemed very decisive. "Something more serious must have happened." Tsurumi picked up the secret letter from the park fishing club again and handed it to Zheng Yan: "There is no malicious intent in this letter. That's one point. Miss Pingzi is very careful and experienced. If something had delayed her, there would have been a phone call, and the embassy would have made a phone call. That's the second point. Judging from these two points, can you still say that nothing has gone wrong?"</p>
<p>As Tsurumi spoke, he picked up the strange note from the table and handed it to Zheng Yan as well, as if he wanted to entrust Zheng Yan with the responsibility of investigating the Pingzi matter clearly.</p>
<p>"Hua Mao Hotel 0915."</p>
<p>The note had not changed, it was still these four Chinese characters and a number.</p>
<p>Tsurumi continued to pace back and forth in the room, thinking deeply. Zheng Yan held the strange note and the secret letter, turning them over and over, looking at the note, then looking at the letter. The more he looked, the more confused his face became, like someone who had never studied Greek, suddenly receiving a letter in Greek. No matter how much he turned it over, it was still a mystery to him. The more he looked, the less he understood.</p>
<p>"Any new insights?" Tsurumi asked boredly.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it will take some time. Maybe we can find some clues."</p>
<p>"Clues can only be found outside… the embassy, the Hua Mao Hotel, the park… These two documents have probably been washed in nitric acid. How can you find any clues there?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Captain. Maybe Miss Nakamura is delayed somewhere. If we give it a little time, things will become clear." Zheng Yan could only use these two sentences to explain back and forth.</p>
<p>"How much time is there? The matter is very urgent…"</p>
<h3>Minor Song of the Tung Flower</h3>
<p>— Su Fan</p>
<p>Tung Flowers</p>
<p>Mist envelops the mountain city, and again, the tung flowers fly white.</p>
<p>You left, heading to the distant seaside, and since then, in my tranquil heart, you have cast a deep infatuation,</p>
<p>Like a tung flower, in the pale white night, I still love to sit alone, writing poems of life. At this table, in the past, how much tinkling laughter would rise! But today, it is as silent as the night.</p>
<p>In the September dusk, the riverbank raised waves, outside the window, tung flowers like clouds, in the night, tung flowers quietly fall, falling into dreams, the night so deep, the dream so far…</p>
<p>At my ear, you once quietly told me the story of the pilgrim in the Arabian desert, telling me to stay up late, to stay with the flame of life.</p>
<p>But when the flame lit up, you left, in the season when the tung flowers bloom white, the night is even longer…</p>
<h3>Little Orchid</h3>
<p>In the gloomy and obscure days, in the endless years of wandering, when I carried the cross of life towards the threshold of my nineteenth spring, I met Little Orchid…</p>
<p>In the northern country, on the bank of the Taolai River, on the edge of the wind-swept desert wilderness, in that lonely place that is sealed by ice and snow all year round, there I met Little Orchid, like a lone sail tossing in the stormy waves, I found that tranquil and warm harbor.</p>
<p>Little Orchid blooms lonely on the edge of the grassland, the simple breath of the grassland nurtures her, nurtures her magnificent life of youth, in the embrace of the grassland, the spring breeze blows and sends the flashing golden years, Little Orchid blooms even more beautifully.</p>
<p>One year, the spring breeze brought the charming fragrance of the grassland, when I wandered there like a gypsy, I was fascinated by the deep fragrance of Little Orchid, and Little Orchid was also intoxicated in my melancholy strings.</p>
<p>Little Orchid used her trembling warm hands to caress the wounded heart of the young wanderer, so, I shook off my sorrow and wounds, and when the spring breeze knocked on the heart of the grassland again, I was as strong as a little lamb.</p>
<p>A thin mist lightly enveloped the dusk of the grassland, and the camel bells shook off the day. On the starry night, the grassland gently swayed with charming songs, and the melancholy strings told stories of long wandering years, I saw Little Orchid's eyes as crystal clear as the silver stars in the distant sky.</p>
<p>One year, a storm broke out on the grassland, and the years of wandering began again. Holding the muted harp, I quietly said goodbye and left there.</p>
<p>Now, Little Orchid still blooms lonely on the edge of the grassland, blooming on the edge of my dreams…</p>

<h3>Post Office Tricks</h3>
<p>— Xuan Shi</p>
<p>Among various public utilities, the post office should be one of the most diligent in advancing its business. There is no need to list its work here. We only need to pay attention to the newspapers and streets on weekdays to get the impression: the post office has new tricks again. Now the post office announces that it has started handling subscription business, so we deeply feel that under the current difficult situation, many things, although they cannot absolutely jump out of that earnest cycle, are not without possibilities. Looking at the actions of Langzheng and other public utilities, we can believe this sentence.</p>
<p>The post office, like many other businesses, is suppressed by the price suppression policy and falls behind in the price competition. We imagine that the lives of the post office staff must be very difficult and cannot be compared with before the war. However, in the midst of difficult circumstances, they are not only not slack, but also actively developing business to serve the people more and increase their convenience. This spirit cannot but be admired. We firmly believe that they inevitably encounter various obstacles in the process of promoting their work. However, obstacles are obstacles, and they must hold obstacle races and move forward. We also firmly believe that if there were no these vicious circle obstacles, the work would definitely be promoted more smoothly, and the business would definitely expand more widely. But we firmly believe that if we shrink back under these obstacles, or even use obstacles as an excuse and refuse to work hard, then there will definitely be more obstacles, and it will not be easy to maintain the status quo of the business. As a result, people will feel more inconvenience and suffer trouble. The "one out and one in" in between is very far apart.</p>
<p>The author does not want to praise the postal authorities, but feels that this spirit of service is worth promoting and worth emulating by staff in various positions. This is not sugarcoating peace, but saying that in an unpeaceful environment, we still have to be a good person and do a little bit of good work. It is boring for oneself and others to push everything to the vicious circle of the situation and spread one's hands to the sky.</p>
<h3>The Imaginary — Fixed Space Floating Airplane</h3>
<p>— Chen Dexin</p>
<p>This year, airplanes have had bad luck. They have fallen down in the east and west. Wealthy passengers, in an instant, have their limbs broken and their heads burned, falling from the paradise of happiness into the miserable hell. I am a poor man, and I have no chance to take a plane, but I am constantly in danger of "sitting at home, and disaster comes from the sky." This is not alarmist talk. There have already been several scenes shown to the public. I pray day and night for scientists to quickly invent a simple and comfortable means of transportation.</p>
<p>The Earth is constantly rotating eastward along the hypothetical Earth axis, traveling 360 degrees in 24 hours, averaging 15 degrees per hour. Tianjin in my country and Washington and San Francisco in the United States are all around 39 degrees north latitude. Washington is about 45 degrees from San Francisco and about 165 degrees from Tianjin. Therefore, the space in Washington at this moment will be the space in San Francisco in three hours, the space in Tianjin in eleven hours, and the space in Washington again in twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Therefore, I imagine that in the future, there may be an airplane that floats in a fixed space. It is not affected by the Earth's gravity, there is no danger of mechanical failure, and there is no need to worry about bad weather. Except for the north-south journey, which still requires flying, east-west can float fixedly in that space after leaving the ground. Passengers sit comfortably in the plane, look out the window, and admire all the scenes on the colorful earth. When you see your destination, you descend. A trip around the world only takes twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>At that time, one floating plane in the east and one floating plane in the west will be lined up and cover the sky.</p>
<p>Finally, I have to declare that I am a person without any scientific knowledge. This article is, of course, extremely absurd in the current era, but it may have some value after a few more years. Please readers don't laugh at my delusion.</p>
<h3>The Whereabouts of Floating Capital</h3>
<p>— Ya Mu</p>
<p>According to Minister Yu’s report, the government issued US dollar bonds to absorb floating capital and stabilize finance in order to achieve a balanced budget. To seek a balanced budget, in addition to relying on tax increases and other methods, issuing bonds and absorbing floating capital is a legitimate means, and the government should have implemented it long ago. Mr. Lou Tongsou's speech was also largely the same. Some say: Taxes are already heavy, it is best to avoid adding them. Let's make a couplet as follows:</p>
<p>Times are difficult and years are barren, all industries are empty, thinking of your people, it is difficult to increase the burden, the rice lost is used to compensate for the tax income;</p>
<p>Open the source and reduce expenditure, sing in unison, support our government in issuing gold bonds, the floating away should know to float back quickly. (Floating, floating capital.)</p>
<h3>New Interpretation of Thick-Skinnedness and Black-Heartedness</h3>
<p>— Dan Meng</p>
<p>Since Li Zongwu's book *Thick Black Theory* was published, it has spread very quickly, and everyone says it is an immortal book; because this booklet not only reveals the true character and true heart of heroes throughout history, but also reveals the most practical principles of life philosophy.</p>
<p>Of course, what he talked about was only the methods and techniques of how to succeed and become prominent, "Small is small kindness, big is big kindness." The content is nothing more than narrating how people with thick faces and black hearts seize power, how to grasp wealth, and how to seek fame. It is a textbook for ambitious people. As for us, the petty citizens who do not hope to be named in history books, it originally seemed that there was no need to study thickness and blackness.</p>
<p>But the fact is not the case. My friend A, who was originally a writer of comic verses, was down and out and could not even find a wooden rice bowl, so he set up a character splitting stall at the post office entrance, also deceiving fools and women. My relative B, whose old occupation was a newspaper reporter, was laid off for half a year. He prepared some money to get a license to make a living by taking photos at small docks to be a mobile photographer, deceiving rural people, taking photos for their national ID cards. And Professor C, who had been a lecturer in the chemistry department for nearly ten years, had to send several of his children to the Huihan Elementary School to get free education, and he himself went to grab the courses at the affiliated high school.</p>
<p>These all show that thick-skinnedness and black-heartedness are the lowest survival strategies in our environment, and are not as necessary as Li said only for those seeking victory, but even to "live in poverty" one must first study thickness and blackness.</p>
<h3>Great Changes in People's Hearts</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>A few years later in Shanghai, a man on a tram gave his seat to a woman. She fainted. After waking up, she thanked him, and he fainted.</p>
<h3>"The Flowers of the Flowering Pear Tree"</h3>
<p>— Wei Han</p>
<p>This is a magnificent and magnificent poem, a heartwarming story. Although in terms of time, it is already a long-separated "Warring States" period, it still deeply arouses our emotional resonance today, thousands of years later.</p>
<p>At the end of the Zhou Dynasty, the heroes separated and ruled. In the turmoil, many legendary figures such as wandering knights and debaters were born, and many generous and tragic historical sites were formed on these figures. The author of "The Flowers of the Flowering Pear Tree" drew his writing material from here.</p>
<p>The production of a historical drama is not an easy task. Although history has already prepared ready-made materials for us, because a drama is not a stereotyped record, it cannot simply repeat the historical facts mechanically. And the history of a certain era must have the historical background that formed the historical facts at that time. This cannot come from the playwright's imagination and false creation; nor can it be forced to put on a modern coat. Therefore, in addition to being faithful to historical facts, an artistic tailoring skill is also needed to transform the dead records into a living and organized story. "The Flowers of the Flowering Pear Tree" is such a successful work.</p>
<p>If we say that the preparation of the script of "The Flowers of the Flowering Pear Tree" is the success of Mr. Guo Moruo; then giving it life and concretizing it on the stage, completely realizing its performance, this will be the achievement of the director, Mr. Ying Yunwei.</p>
<p>The essence of the original work, under his refined technique, can be promoted and displayed on the stage. Especially in the first and fourth acts, that kind of emotion-filled, poetic atmosphere fully demonstrates the director's talent.</p>
<h3>More on Pen Names</h3>
<p>— Lan Gan</p>
<p>People write articles, and instead of using their real name, they create a pen name. There are generally two reasons for this: one is because they feel that using their real name directly may be inconvenient. For example, the author of the famous children's book "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" was a mathematician at a university. He was touched by a sudden whim and wrote that masterpiece, but he himself did not know it: later, the original manuscript was read by his friend, who was very surprised and wanted to take it to publish it, but he thought that writing such things was very incompatible with his identity as a mathematics professor at the university, so he falsely entrusted another pen name to publish it, and it was immediately warmly welcomed by readers - especially children's readers, and, unexpectedly, that thing that was "inconvenient" to be associated with his real name made his reputation in human history far better known than his research in mathematics.</p>
<p>Another reason for using a pen name is because the author wants to use it to commemorate something. There are many examples of this. For example, some people say. The "Lu" character in Mr. Lu Xun's pen name means to commemorate his mother.</p>
<p>Just like many other things, the initial use of pen names was not a bad thing; however, later, after being used by some speculative and opportunistic merchants, the original meaning of using pen names was tarnished a lot. It is said that there was such a joke in the literary world: there was such a person who used two pen names, one pen name to write creations, and one pen name to write criticisms; so, a one-man show of self-pulling and self-singing, self-promoting and self-praising was staged; and was finally exposed. - Naturally, this is quite disgusting.</p>
<h3>Ode to the War Ghost</h3>
<p>— Sun John</p>
<p>Shi Jun, a member of the Qing Dynasty's Manchu royal family, has a poem praising the war ghost, which makes concerned people shed tears when they read it. The words say: "Join the army in the desert to seek a title, before reaching the general, the head has been cut off, the heroic spirit of a hundred battles remains crying in the wild, several families have nightmares and people are sad in the boudoir. The battle clouds are thick and the camp is far away, the border moon is desolate and the old fort is autumn. Who collects the white bones in horse leather? The blood stains are messy, dyeing the helmet." The first two sentences are particularly poignant. Wang Changling of the Tang Dynasty was accustomed to writing about the miserable situation of the borderland outside the Great Wall. When he saw this article, would he also stand by and hold his hands?</p>
<h3>Establishing Oneself as King</h3>
<p>— Ji Shui</p>
<p>"Man's greed is like a snake swallowing an elephant," this is a saying, meaning that man's heart will never be satisfied.</p>
<p>Really, beggars only want a place to shelter from the wind and rain, and three meals of coarse tea and light meals, and they will be satisfied; but when they really get it, they want abundant food and clothing and a comfortable place to live. Like us who do things perfunctorily, when we lose our "job", we only want to have a job, and we will not care about salary and rank, but after working for a while, we will start to express dissatisfaction with the position and salary.</p>
<p>Therefore, in history, there are people like Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of Han, who became emperors and wanted to become immortals even more. Since the Republic of China, people like Yuan Shikai, who was already the president of the whole country, were not satisfied, and had to put on the "dragon robe" to make the people call him "long live," so that he could feel that he was "the world."</p>
<p>On weekdays, when I talked to my friends about these historical traces, I often tried to explain them by relating them to the times. I said, "If it were now, there would be none of these things."</p>
<p>But Franco actually ennobled himself as "Head of State." Moreover, "before Franco loses his ability, he will never establish another king." Does this represent a historical reaction or a turning point in the times?</p>
<h3>Speaking of Xiehouyu (Chinese Allegorical Sayings)</h3>
<p>— Ting Song</p>
<p>"Zheng Wu being appointed prime minister, one can know the current state of affairs," as the saying goes, this is what is called a xiehouyu. How do today's politicians compare to Zheng Wu? When I was thirteen, I saw a letter from my elder brother's friend, filled with discussions of prices. Among them was the phrase "the back of the Prime Minister." I stared blankly, not understanding its meaning. I asked my elder brother, who said, "Why don't you read the biography of Han Xin in the Records of the Grand Historian? You will then understand the brilliance of this saying." Indeed, in Han Xin's biography, Kuai Tong persuaded Han Xin to rebel against Emperor Gao of Han, saying, "The worth of the Prime Minister's back is inestimable." I was deeply surprised that this letter, with its rather crude language, suddenly contained such an elegant xiehouyu. I am now seventy-three years old, having completed a full cycle of the zodiac, and this saying is still deeply imprinted in my mind, impossible to forget. The power of words is truly great. The other day, at a dinner party with friends, I happened to mention this incident. A friend suddenly said, "You are fond of discussing couplets. Are you also aware that Zeng Xiangxiang (Zeng Guofan) has a xiehou couplet of unparalleled brilliance?" I replied, "I have never heard of it." My friend then recited the couplet: "Return, oh return! The moonlit pavilion, the shadows of flower petals; cannot proceed! The wind and rain of Chu, the call of the partridge." This couplet was composed by Wen Zheng Gong (Zeng Guofan) as a lament for his brother, who died in the Sanhe disaster. Apart from the words "flower petals," which allude to the story of Emperor Ming of Tang and the flower art pavilion, concerning brothers, the entire couplet is exceptionally sublime. And the phrase "cannot proceed, brother" is commonly known. Used as a xiehouyu, it makes people, upon recitation, feel as if the soul has returned. The moonlit night, the Chu sky, the sound of birds, the shadows of flowers, the utmost brotherly affection, fill the lines. It is as if there is someone here, about to call out. If not for Wen Zheng's masterful brush, how could he paint such vivid images and sounds, so comprehensive and thorough?</p>
<h3>Literary and Art Scene</h3>
<p>The National Conservatory of Music held informal concert charity practice performances in the main auditorium of its Jiangwan campus on the 28th of last month and the 3rd of this month. The program included piano, violin, and cello solos, as well as various vocal solos, with generally good results. The public performance is scheduled for mid-May at the Lyceum Theatre.</p>
<p>Recently, someone concerned about the future of culture has written "A Fundamental Policy for Cultural Governance," hoping to use a business approach to alleviate the hardships faced by culture, gathering opinions from various individuals. Mr. Gu Lijiang has generously funded the printing, widely distributing it to various cultural and educational circles, and welcomes newspapers and magazines to reprint and discuss it, for the sake of wider dissemination. It is also entrusted to the International Publishing House (Distribution Office, 7 Qinghai Road) for sale at cost, priced at 500 yuan per copy, so that those who have not received a complimentary copy can purchase it.</p>
<p>"Hiroshima," a famous work by the American author John Hersey, has been praised by American book critics as the most moving non-fiction work of 1946. The book, translated by Huang Jiayin, editor of Xifeng, has already sold out its first edition, and the second edition is now available. The general distribution office is Xifeng Society, 186 Dazhou Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"You... you don't... understand... my pain... either?" After three or four minutes, Jin Aili, lowering her head and trying her best to hold back her crying, finally blurted out this fragmented sentence in a very low voice.</p>
<p>This moved Lao Zhu. He turned his head in surprise, staring at Jin Aili, whose face had turned very pale.</p>
<p>"Don't be so upset! Let's say I was wrong, okay?"</p>
<p>The woman glanced at him with resentful eyes.</p>
<p>"Do you think Lao Zhu is not as good as Xu Fatty and Xiao Shen?" She took a breath and asked softly, still with her head lowered.</p>
<p>Lao Zhu saw her pathetic look and felt a little compassion in his heart, but he couldn't help but want to laugh.</p>
<p>"Is he treating you well?" He used another question as a reply.</p>
<p>"Not bad, Lao Zhu!" She suddenly became more excited, raising her face and staring affectionately at him. "He said that he would officially marry me when we get to Guiyang. Do you think he's lying to me?"</p>
<p>"Of course, I can't guarantee that, but I don't dare to talk nonsense." He gestured, stopping Jin Aili, who was about to interject. "In short, you don't have to think too far ahead! Now, you first tell me, how much money did he give you?"</p>
<p>Mentioning this point, Jin Aili felt truly comforted in her heart.</p>
<p>"He gave me a diamond ring." She raised her right hand and waved it, but Lao Zhu didn't look at the sparkling thing. "And five hundred US dollars."</p>
<p>Lao Zhu nodded and picked up the soy milk to drink.</p>
<p>"When we get to Guiyang, he promised to give me another million yuan to buy two houses." She was truly open with Lao Zhu, and Lao Zhu remained silent; so she felt embarrassed. "Lao Zhu! Why don't you say something? Tell me! Do you think he will be like Xiao Shen again?"</p>
<p>"What do you think of him?" Lao Zhu put down the glass and asked with a smile.</p>
<p>"He's an old man, he should be more honest than young people." Jin Aili's viewpoint was representative of most dancing girls. "I knew him when I was in Hong Kong, but he didn't have money then, now..."</p>
<p>"Now he's too rich! Isn't that right? Aili." Zhu Zhaonian said jokingly: "However, you have to be careful, rich old men are not more well-behaved than young men! Besides, you should understand where his money comes from? He uses public vehicles for big business. True, everything is chaotic in our country, and maybe it won't be exposed for the time being, but who can guarantee that in the future? So, Aili, you don't need to look too far ahead. Take this opportunity to get some money from him and escape in comfort. Wouldn't that be good?" (37)</p>
