<h3>黨團統一組織　首次中常會議　修正中央各部委會組織規程</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕黨團統一組織後之國民黨中常會，十八日上午九時開首次會議，蔣總裁親自主持，宋子文報吿捐獻中國建設銀公司個人投資全部股份，作爲救濟抗戰及剿匪而殉難之本黨黨員家屬基金，全塲一致鼓掌，宋氏報吿詞，係由秘書張壽賢宣讀，總裁對宋氏此舉，甚爲贊許。繼討論宋委員等四十一人前在四中全會建議，組織中國國民黨同志互助協會，籌募互助基金，推動救助同志工作一案，當經決議交財務委會擬具具體實施辦法，提出下次常會。旋通過：（一）修正中執委會組織大綱，（二）骨年部組織規程，（三）理論研委會組織規程，（四）中央各部委會組織通則等案。又對於四中全會交下由常會指定若干人成立研委會，負責研究改進本黨組織一案，亦經決議由黨團統一組織秀會負責研究，最後總裁提出推陳　屏爲靑年部部長，梁寒操爲理論研究委會主委案，全塲一致通過。</p>
<p>〔又電〕記者今訪新任國民黨靑年部長陳雪屏氏，就詢關於該部今後工作方針，據稱：本部工作重在訓練，中國經八年之抗戰與共匪武裝叛亂，國勢艱危，社會不安，經濟貧困，致使靑年感受煩悶與痛苦，吾人應如何誘導靑年，使其認清當前局勢與自身之責任，共同爲三民主義的新中國而努力，實爲本部首要之急務。按陳氏服務敎育界，在北大任敎已有十七年之歷史，原任北京大學訓導長。</p>
<h3>中常委宋子文　獻產報告詞　詳述建設銀公司情形</h3>
<p>主席，各位同志，上周四中全會時，總裁已經宣布，子文等發起募集基金，以救濟爲抗戰及剿匪而殉難之本黨黨員家屬一案，並及子文已決定，願將所有在中國建設銀公司主要投資事業中之全部股份，如淮南礦路公司，鄱樂煤礦公司，揚子電氣公司及漢口旣濟水電公司之股份，貢獻作此項基金之用。</p>
<p>今日在當會中，國將中國建設銀公司之經營情形提出報吿，因外間對於銀公司之情形多未明悉，甚至或有不免誤會之處</p>
<p>當民國廿二年，本人辭去財政部長職務以後，即從事於工商事業，蓋當時本人所注意之問題有二。第一：如何能在國人可以接受之條件下，較勵大量外資之輸入及如何獲取外國技術管理之協助。第二，爲如何促進國內資本市塲之發展，因缺此二者，我國工業必不能有大規模之進展。</p>
<p>我國以前舉借之外債，幾全部須以稅收爲担保，如關稅及鹽稅，均因借款關係，而由外人管理。至於織路借款，亦常有由外人號督，或共同管理之規定。而四國銀行團對我國則仍無一借款得以成功，且其時我國工商業之公司組織，方在萌芽時代，多數工商事業，均以私人或家屬或合夥之方式經營，一經人事變遷，事業即隨之不振。眞正之資本市塲，尙付闕如，一切事業，幾全賴拆款，或短期貸金，以資周轉，而無長期債券市塲之便利。</p>
<p>爲解決上述兩項問題，本人經本黨同志及銀行界友好之贊助，發動組織中國建設銀公司，成爲吾國第一眞正投資公司，至抗戰開始時爲止，銀公司對於吸收外資及建立國內資本市塲，已多貢獻。</p>
<h3>過云收吸外資　促進工業建設</h3>
<p>國外資本，對於我國市塲，祗須我國有信用可靠之對手與之合作，共同參加其投資，並保護其利益，分担其經營之風險，亦即願放棄過去有損我國主權之條件，而踴躍參加。自民國廿三年中國建設銀公司成立，即以適應此項需要。</p>
<p>在民國廿五年時，中國建設銀公司與英國之中英銀公司及匯豐銀行合作成立英金貸款，爲完成杭甬段鐵路之用，復在廿六年抗戰之前，成立貸款兩次。一，爲擬用以建築自浦口至襄陽之鐵路，一，爲建築自廣州至梅縣之鐵路，惜均以戰事關係而中止。此外，銀公司又代江西省政府向英方貸款，建立南昌之水電廠。</p>
<p>中國建設銀公司與法國合作，成績更佳，法國方面，由巴黎荷蘭銀行，東方匯理銀行，拉蕯兄弟公司及中法銀行等四家，組織法國銀團，與銀公司合作，從事中國鐵路之建設及礦產之開發。民國廿五年十二月，法銀團與銀公司及交通部訂立貸款合約，以供修建成渝鐵路所需之材料，我國則担負在國內所需之資金，抗戰軍興，該綫全路地畝，均已購妥，全部隨道亦已完成，即橋樑路基，亦都已完工。</p>
<p>在抗戰時期，銀公司對於發展我國經濟之努力，亦未中止。在京滬淪陷後，政府以西南爲抗戰根據地，乃商由銀公司與法方成立娥築南寗至鎭南關之鐵路，以通越南，此項工程已大半完成，不幸後因敵人侵入桂南而中止。</p>
<p>叙昆鐵路，則爲規模更大之計劃，該協定於廿八年簽訂，擬由昆明接至四川之叙付，以通長江。同時對於開發沿綫礦產計劃，亦曾加以商討。</p>
<p>美國對華經濟發展之重心，不在鐵路，而在工業。是以銀公司曾與美國實業界磋商，關於人造絲，紙張，肥料，卡車及橡膠之製造計劃，除與美國樹膠公司合作，製造樹膠製品外，　他計劃，均暫行停頓。銀公司經營之宗旨，即在設法集資，以促進各項工業之建立，使其能　立經營，貢之於社會，以便各方面之投資進展。</p>
<p>就以上所陳各項過去事業之進展，可見銀公司之吸收外資，已經不如向例之以稅收爲担保品條件，以及由外人監督或共同管理業務，對於各種建設事業，如果須利用外國之技術經營協助，則其所雇用之人員，仍向該事業之主管國籍人員負責，並不因債務而有任何特殊之規定。</p>
<h3>建設國內市場　獲有相當成就</h3>
<p>我國因無資本市塲，以致經濟發展大受阻碍，業已述及。</p>
<p>我國一般民衆，對於公司股票，除民初之橡皮股票，民十前後之交易所信託公司股票，曾有間歇性之投機熱外，幾可謂毫無興趣，戰前之華商上海證券交易所，除政府公債交易外，並無股票上市。其原因，由於以前各種交易所股票紛紛失敗，以致對證券交易所本　失去信仰，同時因有地位之公司，輕視交易所，以爲一旦其股票在交易所上市，即帶有投機色彩，有損公司本身地位，當時證券交易所爲挽救起見，特商銀公司協助，願以半數股票讓售於銀公司，而請由銀公司代為改組內部，俾有地位之公司，願以股票在交易所上市，並請銀公司代洽金融機構，對經紀人予以貸款，此項辦法，雙方本已成立協議，後因抗戰發動，以致懸示實行。民國三十四年，本人在行政院院長任時，該所舊事重提，仍願履行前約，本人以已任政府職務，特商銀公司放棄此項權利，將應得股票悉數讓渡於國家銀行，此後，該所改組，重開股票交易，營業甚佳，盈益之鉅，有目共睹，但本人及銀公司，則均毫無遺憾，蓋因放棄此項權利，係屬當爲之事。</p>
<p>當廿五六年時，政府決定政策，對於各項建設之經營範圍，以國防工業，幹綫鐵道，水力發電等，不宜於私人投資之事業爲限，依照此項政策，張靜江先生主持下之建設委員會，正在逐漸縮，小其業務　團，擬將所屬已成事業，不屬國營範聞者，改歸民營，其時，銀公司爲惟一能担負此項事業之機構，因之遂受委託，代售該會之淮南煤礦及鐵路，首都及感舉　廠，銀公司受託後，即組織　南礦路公司及揚子電氣公司（此與揚子建業公司無關），登報　開募股，未久即吿竣事，不幸以戰事發生，一部份認股人未能按認額繳款，銀公司負包募之責，不能不自行墊購，並担負因戰事所發生之風險，此爲銀公司成爲淮南礦路及揚子電氣兩公司大股東之由來，而當時原意，固僅欲保留小數，俾在兩公司內，得參加管理而已。</p>
<p>廿六年春，商辦漢口旣濟水電公司，經濟營業，均感困難，因銀公司技術人員甚多，亦請爲參加股本，並爲改組經營，亦告成功。</p>
<p>此外，銀公司曾爲上海永安公司募集十年爲期之公司債一批，以淸償其短期銀行債務。又爲廣東黃埔開埠，募集美金公債一批，另爲靑島市政建設募集市政公債一批。</p>
<p>根據上述事實，即知銀公司在抗戰以前，對於吸引外資及建設國內資本市塲之雙重任務，均獲有相當成就。</p>
<p>故我國如無抗戰之發生，則在短期內，已可建築新鐵路六綫，其他重要工業，亦已可發展，較之由民三至廿三年，在二十年內，以外資之協助，而並無一條鐵路建築完成之情形，相去誠不可以道里計也。</p>
<h3>修正否決權規定　我贊同美國建議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十八日廣播：今日中國表示贊同美團建議，願將五强在聯合國安理會中之否決權規定加以修正。中國代表團首席代表王世杰外長在聯合國大會中發表演說稱：修正否決權規定之建議，雖有助於聯合國之前途，但修正或取消否決權，並不足以完全解決聯合國機構當今而臨之困難。如世界各國分裂爲集團之傾向不予根本消除，則聯合國機構之基本威脅，依然存在。王氏對馬歇爾昨日所提設立一特別機構，藉以促進世界和平與安全之建議，並未提及。</p>
<h3>主席召見薛光前　垂詢歐洲政治經濟情形</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京十八日電〕蔣主席於十八日下午五時，在黃埔路官邸召見新近回國之駐義大使館公使薛光前氏，談約半小時，主席垂詢關於巴爾幹及歡洲一般政治，經濟情形甚詳。按薛氏於年初代表中國參加聯合國巴爾幹糾紛調查團，遍經巴爾幹各國，歷時半載，最近始經美返國，對於當前國際形勢，具有深切之認識。</p>
<h3>公敎人員待遇　已涉饑餓綫上　監委僉主勿使為些米油鹽而憂</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕公敎人員待遇題，監院十八日晨舉行談話時，會有熟烈討論，出席監委廿餘人，莫不踴躍發言，會認今日公敎人員生活已瀕饑餓綫上，低級公務員月入僅五六十萬者，不及戰前十二三元，即就監委本身而論，所得亦僅及戰前三十元左右，工作之餘，幾全爲柴，米，油，鹽所苦，養生送死皆不遑顧及，對工作效率，當有影響，而另一方面，不少政府官員藉種種便利，極盡享受能事，有每週僅來京開會一二次，而在京備有巨夏，出入汽車，且有十餘僕從供其指揮，一切皆由公家供給，不平孰甚。立院曾有一部份立委建議舉辦公務人員貸款，此事實行時，困難綦多，同時，政府旣有錢貸款，何不直接用以加薪，惟此時調整待遇徒增發行，刺激物價，受其惠者，不一定爲公務員，亦非善策，談話結果，歸納成下列兩點：（一）由下而上，政府應勿令公務員爲柴，米，汕，鹽而憂，使彼等不再轉輾饑餓綫上。（二）由上而下，居高位者應與下屬同甘苦，政府提倡節約，低級人員根本無約可節，一切皆應由在上者倡導。傳作義治軍成功，即在其能與士卒同甘苦，此種風氣，應推及各方，會中並推定干委員樹德草擬建議書，俾正式向政府提出。</p>
<h3>英民航大臣　納桑抵京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕英民航大臣納桑爵士十八日下午四時乘不列顚海外航空公司藍開斯特式運輸專機，自港抵京，交長兪大維。外次葉公超，禮賓司長凌其翰。民航局長戴安國及英大使史諦文等，均親往迎接。</p>
<h3>張院長今晨飛平　將往津瀋長幷等地巡視　搜集各種資料並注意貪污案件</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕行政院長張羣視察華北·東北，定十九晨啓程，如準備不及，即於廿日起飛赴北平，視察地點爲平·津·長·瀋·太原等地，除視察吏治，探訪民情外，並將特别注意各地貪汚案件。自北方歸後，張氏可能再往華南一行。　〔又電〕張羣定十九日出巡，將搜集有關軍事·政台·敎育與社會各方面之資料，尤着重於省市行政。隨行者有參事周君亮，富伯平，秘書游建文及新聞局副局長鄧友德等。</p>
<h3>魏特使飛返華府　即向總統提出調查報告</h3>
<p>〔合衆社加州費爾機塲十七日電〕魏德邁將軍十七日自檀香山抵達此間陸軍機塲，按魏氏曾在檀島勾留一週，準備向杜魯門提出中國及朝鮮局勢之報吿。渠拒絕發表談話，並以手拍其公事包稱，錦襄妙計皆在其中。魏氏着陸後不久，復乘輕型機飛往舊金山，將於太平洋標準時間午後七時續飛華府。據華盛頓國務院估計，魏氏可能於十八日上午十一時半抵達。</p>
<p>〔中央社盛盛頓電〕魏德邁定今飛抵華府，向杜魯門報吿所率領之考察團在中韓兩國調查之結果，其所提建議，料將形成美國在華之政策。杜魯門定廿日訪問巴西歸來，渠返抵華府，料將立與魏德邁討論中國局勢。</p>
<p>〔合衆社北平十八日電〕對孫科氏之警告，此間有資格美方人士十八日稱：「此項聲明不可能改變國務院對華政策之決定孫科稱如美國仍使中國徬徨歧途，則中國將與蘇聯修好，此言當爲外交上之虛聲恫嚇，不足以改變魏使團之立塲，惟美方人士希望一見合衆社之原文，然後相信孫氏曾有此聲明，蓋恐此間華文報紙登載時容有錯誤也。</p>
<p>中國半官方面告合衆社稱，孫氏談話時常有感情衝動之處，故其聲明「並不代表政府之見解」。其聲明爲「對魏氏公開批評中國政府之假人反應」。孫氏最近雖有反蘇談話，將蘇　與日本等觀，然渠以前固被公認爲親蘇政策之推動者也。</p>
<h3>憑藉特權牟利　純為外間虛構</h3>
<p>抗戰發生之後，本人奉命赴美，爲國服務，卅三年返國後，受任行政院長，即將從前所有商業關係全部解除，原任銀公司及其他關係公司之董事職務，悉數辭去，本人且要求銀公百將戰前所獲得之鐵路合約權利，奉還政府，同時，請其在本人任行政院長任內，不得從事於任何與政府有關之營業，銀公司對本人之願望，均能切實履行。其最可令人失笑者，即美國合衆社會發稿，謂銀公司憑藉特權，獲得政府鉅額外匯，從中牟利等語，此事經我政府調查，結果，銀公司自抗戰勝利後，僅向中央銀行請得美金八百七十七元六角二分，爲購買打字機及零星文具之用，爲數之微，幾令人不能置信，可知眞實之事，有時固較　構者更可奇異</p>
<p>抗戰勝利，本黨同志因抗日剿共陣亡犧牲者，爲數至多，而其遺族乏人照料，生活艱難，困苦情形，至可憫惻，本黨各同志及本人均認為有捐獻基金以資救濟之必要，本人以淮南。鄱樂。揚子。旣濟四公司，現均有巨貴資產，如能將銀公司所執四公司之股票捐獻基金，實可為建立始基之舉。</p>
<h3>深信其他股東　能為同樣貢獻</h3>
<p>淮南煤礦，煤斤儲量戰前估計不過二千萬至五千萬噸，戰後該公司感於長江一帶需煤之殷，對於探礦一事，特別注意，並聘著名地質家謝家榮博士，在附近各地廣事查勘，經其努力，得於八公山勘得新煤田，儲量奮當，估計不下六億噸，且屬平棺，開採容易，距長江邊之裕溪口，不過二百十四公里，對於上海及長江一帶，供給便利，實爲我國最有希望之煤礦。此外，淮南尙獲有江四鄱樂之採礦權，將來長江中游，亦可獲得廉價之燃料。</p>
<p>在將來，旣有揚子。旣濟兩電氣公司之電，又有淮南。鄱樂之煤，自不難以廉價之電力使上海南京·漢口各地構成一電力網，以發展我國中部之工業建設。</p>
<p>本人僅爲中國建設銀公司股東之一，對於該公司在其煤礦及公用事業之投資，自祗能就本人所有部份如數捐獻，惟本人曾與其他股東多人交換意見，深信該公司多數股東贊同此舉，對於銀公司所執四公司之股票，或能爲同樣之貢獻，本人於短期內，請求公司召開股東會，討論此事，俾本黨爲國犧牲之同志遺族，得以獲得救濟也。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>宋子文的義舉</h3>
<p>國民黨中常委宋子文氏等於四中全會閉幕之日，建議組織同志互助協會，籌集基金，捐助爲抗戰及剿匪而殉難之黨員遺屬；宋氏並首先捐獻私產，將其本人所有中國建設銀公司全部股份，充作此項基金。宋氏此舉，實可視爲國民黨新生的象徵；故此項消息一經傳出，卽獲得全國朝野的歡迎。惟中國建設銀公司的內容如何？宋氏獻捐股份的價値如何？均爲國人所兩欲明瞭者。</p>
<p>昨日國民黨中常會開會，宋氏特向該會提出詳細報吿，謂中國建設銀公司之任務：一爲在國人可以接受的條件之下，儘量吸收外人投資，並取得外人技術上的協助；二爲促進國內資本市塲之發展，藉使我國工業有大規模之改進。自二十二年創辦迄今，除貸借外債建築鐵路外，其主要之投資事業有四種：（一）淮南礦路公司；（二）鄱樂煤礦公司：（三）揚子電氣公司；（四）漢口旣濟水電公司。由此可知，中國建設銀公司是一種普通的金融機構，而是我國建國事業中重要的一環。論理這些事業本可由國家經營，而以私人企業及吸引外資經營之，尤爲難能。宋氏獻捐之義舉，不僅在救濟爲抗戰與剿匪而殉國之黨員家屬，而且欲將私人經營之企業歸還公營，其意義格外覺得重大。</p>
<p>國民黨推翻滿淸，締造民國；打倒袁世凱，再造共和；掃除軍閥，完成統一；擊敗日寇，將百年來的不平等條約，一筆勾銷。這是國民黨對於國家民族的豐功偉業，足以永垂不朽，爲任何人所不能否認。但是國民黨的成就，除了感謝勞苦功高的領袖而外，還得歸功於那些舍生取義及殺身成仁的先烈與志士，他們才是眞正的無名英雄。他們旣已僞黨國而犧牲，他們所遺留的家屬，自應由未死的黨員負責，否則如何能對得起這些殉難的同志？又怎能鼓勵來者再爲黨國犧牲？所以宋氏此舉，不僅可以安慰殉難向志，而且也足以鼓勵未死的同志。我們熱望國民黨全體黨員，均能本着『有錢出錢，有力出力』的原則，羣起饗應；富有者固不可讓宋民專美於前，就是一般黨員，也應該量力獻捐，不問多少，均屬有益；所謂集腋成裘，只要大家　能够踴躍捐獻，宋氏發動此項建議的目的，不難全部實現：國民黨與中國的命運，實已不可分離，我們一方面希望救濟殉難家屬的範圍能够擴大，將來有一天不限於國民黨黨員：另一方面，希望國民黨以外的人士，也大家能相繼捐獻於國家。</p>
<p>此外，我們反覆誦讀宋氏向中常會所提出的報告書之後，更發生下列幾項感想：</p>
<p>第一，中國建設銀公司向與外界頗有隔閡，知其內容者甚少。但閱宋民報吿之後，始知該公司並非普通性質之企業公司或貿易之類，買賤賣貴，唯利是圖，而爲眞正以發展實業爲目的的投資公司，其所投資的事業，不僅與國計民生有密切關係，而且其宗旨乃在促進中國工業的改進。這一點，頗可爲一般公司所效法。時至今日，工商凋敝，民生痛苦，不堪言狀，而遊資則充斥於市。目前普通商人集資組織公司，若不囤積貨物，卽往往從事投機，像中國建設銀公司之投資實業者，似十不得一。所以我們希望上海工商界，今後組織公司，均能利用遊資，投之於生產事業，則物價漲風，庶幾可以稍戢。</p>
<p>第二，在目前情形之下，我國從事建國復興工作，唯有走「自力更生」之一途。所謂自力更生者，卽欲國人人人都能做到「克己報國」，使國家經濟不致發生困難。宋氏獻捐股份總値幾何？確數固當難估計，但淮南媒礦儲媒量卽有六億噸，其價値不可謂不鉅。在轉移人心方面，自有極大的作用。過去中國沒有大資本家，但在抗戰八年之後，因通貨膨脹的結果，產生許多富商大賈。現在建國艱難，民窮國貧，富有者自應慷慨解囊，踴躍輸將，或作爲救濟基金，或作爲建國投資。宋氏已開風氣之先，但願國人聞風響應。</p>
<p>第三，在一二個月之前，外國通訊社不明底蘊，曾一度盛傳特權公司利用官價外匯之說，中國建設銀公司亦被牽及，當時我們固尙不明眞相，現在看了宋氏的報吿　却可以恍然大悟。我們對於任何消息，今後自須在查明事實之後，始可加以判斷，人云亦云，應引爲大戒。</p>

<h3>美國將朝鮮問題正式提交聯大會　建議組織委員會實地調查一般局勢　如無結果將取單獨行動</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處弗魯辛十八日電〕美國今日以提議兩項，呈交聯合國秘書長賴依，請求列入聯合國大會議程內，其一爲成立關於和平與安全之大會臨時委員會，其二爲討論朝鮮獨立問題。</p>
<p>〔合衆駐華盛頓十八日電〕此間權威方面對本社透露：美國解決朝鮮問題建議之內容，約如下述：美國將向聯合國建議，組織一委員會調查局勢，並監督朝鮮南北兩佔區早日舉行選舉。此外，更建議此項選舉結果，將作爲決定在聯合國監督之下，全朝鮮中央議會之構成基礎。美國並將建議，聯合國及朝鮮臨時政府將決定蘇美軍隊自朝鮮撤退日期。在美國計劃之下，朝鮮臨時議會與聯合國代表協商後，即可決定起草朝鮮憲法之程序。該方面人士又稱，美國對此項計劃如不發生最後改變，決建議朝鮮臨時政府及聯合國委員會對於朝鮮所需要恢復其安定之經濟範圍及方式，應加以決定。同時又悉，如聯合國不能使朝鮮獨立問題獲得進展，美國亦將作準備，並要求國會對朝鮮南部作充分財政援助。</p>
<p>〔聯合社漢城十八日電〕美蘇混合委會蘇代表團今日發表聲明，譴責美國造成朝鮮問題僵高。據稱美國吹毛求疵，存心拒絕蘇方對於與何種朝鮮政黨協商組織臨時政府之建議。蘇聯代表團堅持原來觀點，認爲雙方如願切實履行莫斯科決議，聯合委員會必能順利解決朝鮮問題。</p>
<h3>對馬歇爾在聯大演說　蘇代表將施反攻　美國建議已獲多數支持</h3>
<p>〔聯合社紐約十八日電〕各國代表今日對於美國建議聯合國大會設立五十五國安全委員會一節，現正密切等待蘇聯反響。大多數小國代表似正力謀支持美國提案，中英法三國立塲雖未宣布，恐亦與美國採取一致行動。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約弗魯辛草地十八日電〕蘇聯首席代表維辛斯基定今日在聯大會中，對馬歇爾建議之設立五十五國「和平與安全」常務委員會一項主張，發動反攻。接近蘇代表團之人士謂維辛斯基特以反對該五十五國和平與安全委員會之理由，將爲此一機構乃安理會之重　機構，足以剷除安理會維持世界和平與安全之主要責任。消息靈通方面並料維辛斯基在全體大會中所將申訴之其他點，尙有：（一）希臘之內亂乃美國之干涉一手造成；（二）美國之將朝鮮問題置入大會議程，爲破壞四强莫斯科協定；（三）美國建議在憲章第六章下之問題中廢止否決權之適用，爲違反聯合國之憲章；（四）美國之拒絕同意蘇聯關於管制原子能之意見，爲聯合國原子能管制機構遲遲不能成立之原因。此外，預料維辛斯基並將抨擊阿根廷之不顧上屆聯大決議，任派大使駐在馬德里，以及英美之抗不遵從上屆聯大關於撤退外國境內駐軍之決議案。</p>
<h3>美政蘇照會</h3>
<p>副本送達中英政府</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十七日電〕國務院今日公佈上週所致蘇聯外長莫洛托夫之照會，答覆其拒絕參加朝鮮問題之四强會談。略謂，「莫洛托夫閣下，頃接九月四日來函，藉悉蘇聯政府已決定拒絕美政府所提召開四强會談，迅速實現莫斯科協定有關朝鮮問題協議之建議。溯自兩年以來，美政府屢有與蘇政府實行此項協議之誠意，終因美蘇兩國代表團意見相左而未能如願，致朝鮮臨時政府無早日成立希望，仍陷於分裂局面而不穫獨立。美政府認爲此種情形，不能任其長此下去，故今擬將朝鮮獨立問題提交聯大會討論，俾可早日使朝鮮久受痛苦之人民，獲得自由與獨立。本照會副本亦已送交萬斯科協定簽字國之中英政府。」</p>
<h3>對否決權問題　兩集團舌戰</h3>
<p>〔中央社弗魯辛草地十七日電〕聯合國大會正開始廣泛辯論時，拉丁美洲國家，與斯拉夫集團，今因否決權問題，已形成對立，唇槍舌劍，各有立塲。　國外長鮑維脫首先發難，反對五大國否決權。蘇聯集團之波蘭，立予　擊，宣稱，波蘭「堅決反對修改聯合國憲章之任何企圖，對安理會五强一致表決票則，尤爲堅持。」　氏首先發言聲稱，否決　被濫用，將永不能獲致和平，且大損聯合國之聲譽。鮑氏續籲請大會恢復舊金山會議，制訂聯合國憲軍時之融洽空氣，當時各國及出席大會之各國代表，均置共同利益於一已私利之上。波蘭除反對修改憲章外，並另乘機指責馬歇爾計劃，攻擊　國藐視聯合國，並忽視其他戰時盟國之需要。</p>
<h3>法外長抵紐約</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約十七日電〕法外長皮杜爾今日飛抵紐約，以領導法代表團參加聯合國大會。皮氏下機後表示，在舊金山開始之任務，當使其縱續進行，蓋其偉大之期望固尙未實現也。皮氏關於否決權問題，避免發表意見。</p>
<h3>聯大指導委員會通過　希臘問題列入議程　并議決設置特委會處理聖地問題</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約弗魯辛草地十八日電〕聯合國大會指導委會昨夜不顯蘇聯及波蘭之反對，決議將美國所提承認希臘政治獨立及土地完整已遭威脅之案，置於本屆大會議程之上。指導委會並一致通過設立專門討論巴勒斯坦問題之特別委員會，此一委會與大會之其他主要委員會相平行，由大會全體會員組成，直接向大會負責。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表在指導委會中聲明對於阿根廷所提召開大會，以修正憲章廢止否決權之案未能提出討論。英代表麥克尼爾亦聲明，對於阿根廷所提以聯合國充分會員資格給與巴基斯坦及印度之案有所說明。當討論美國之希臘問題決議案時，蘇代表葛羅米柯竭力反對將其列入大會議程，並質問美國此舉之動機何在。渠指出在大會中討論此一問題，適足使巴爾幹局勢更趨緊張，危害希臘與其鄰邦之關係。故蘇聯絕對不能同意將本案列入大會議程。美代表奧斯汀答辯稱，關於希臘問題之何以必須置於聯大議程，已曾由馬歇爾詳爲釋明，蘇聯如果反對，則儘可在全體大會中獲取三分之二多數之支持以剔除之。</p>
<h3>顧維鈞演說</h3>

<h3>日閣議通過　煤礦國營案</h3>
<p>政府三與黨獲致協議</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京十八日電〕自民主黨對煤　國營問題再提出修正案以後，昨舉行政府三與黨聯絡會議，會議中心爲煤礦國營法案與煤業公團之關係，首由社會國協兩黨發表意見，希望民主黨放棄成見，將兩者分開，但民主黨則仍堅持成立煤　公團乃煤礦國營之先決問題，會議無結果而散。會後社會黨再推水谷商相與民主黨方面協商，製成最後之折衷案，今日臨時閣議上，已予以手續上之通過，即決定向國會提出。</p>
<h3>日自由民主兩黨携手　新黨運動具體化　國民協同黨亦可能參加</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京十八日電〕保守新黨運動，正由以自由黨大野幹事長及星島總務會長等爲中心之一派，與代表民主黨幣原系之田中副　長爲中心之一派，秘密發動推進中。新黨正以自由，民主，國協三黨黨員聯合組織之「第一議員俱樂部」之一部份議員組織之「反共保守聯盟」爲基礎，而向各方試探，其行動隨國會之復會而更趨活躍。十六日田中副議長與大野幹事長於副議長室，就新黨工作進展情况交換情報。</p>
<p>又幣原名譽總裁與所謂反　田派之議員數名，亦已就煤礦國營問題及新黨工作相互懇談。此外長會見，試討田中對新黨工作之真意。田中曾稱：「自由民主兩黨將來之大合作，相信係一宿命，惟欲分裂民主黨而立即參加自由黨者殊不見多，若組織保守新黨，亦應採取舉黨一致之行動。故幣原蘆田兩氏，有緊密聯繫之必要。」民主黨內現已發生對聯合政權之嚴格批判，而對煤礦國營法案，蘆田幣原兩派皆在保守黨之前提下採取强硬之修正態度，故兩派間已無如以前之總裁問題及聯立問題之深刻對立。自由黨亦暫時停止淸算從來對蘆田一派之感情之立塲，而謀保守陣營之太團結。至於此種團結之形式，盡量揭出保守黨大革新之旗幟，以謀輿論之支持。故若民主黨以「一水會」爲中心之中間派，能調和黨內意見，則在十月下旬，自由民主兩黨間將積極磋商組織新黨問題。又國民協同黨及「第一議員俱樂部」之小黨派，亦將積極活動。</p>

<p>馬萊託購金條</p>
<p>我於八月一日早晨九時由家中出來，先至匯中飯店會朋友，九時三刻至南京路馬斯酒排間，旋至新麗珠酒排間，與馬萊會晤。初談者爲關於私人文件事體，吃過咖啡十分鐘後，馬萊問我能不能設法購買五根金條，每條車十兩，共計五十兩。我允其所請，即往與余商量。余說有辦法，每條索價美金五百八十五元。我赴禮查飯店告知每條値美金五百九十元，其中每條五元係我的佣金。約至五時交貨。馬萊囑我借汽車一輛，幷云不要車夫，我即與派　洛夫磋商，言明每一鐘點租費八萬元，由我自己開車，先往禮查飯店接馬萊。此時馬已將軍裝缷下，換着便衣，幷向我借便帽一頂。詢其何故，馬答買賣黑市黃金，身着軍服，被人看見不好。汽車開至間明園路仁記路停下，將余接上車，我即介紹稱：「渠係馬萊上校」。法官詢其何以冒充上校，却利稱因爲說上校好像莊嚴點，這是我自已的意思，幷非馬萊囑咐。</p>
<p>見余渾身是血</p>
<p>余進車後與馬萊幷排坐於車後，余左馬右，馬華即命向虹橋路開行。據馬云開向鄉村總會，此時約爲下午五時卅分至六時。車抵高爾夫球總會附近，忽聞砰然一響，似車胎爆裂聲，我回頭看時，馬命我繼續開行。此時惟見余雙目注視馬萊，手按胸前。迨至滬靑公路時，馬命我將車停於路右，此時見余渾身是血，馬萊手持染滿血液毛巾，余口中連呼：「勿殺我，你把東西都拿去好了，我決不向警察局報吿，却利知道我的。」馬萊將車門打開，將余身拖出車外，我問渠：「爲何如此做？」渠答：「不得不如此做。」旋將車門關好，命我折返。庭上詢以馬萊此時取得金條否？答我簡直沒有時間想。車返滬時，見馬萊曾將染血毛巾擲於路旁。我與馬萊逕返家中，見馬萊在車中檢到彈壳一隻。渠入內即進浴室洗手。上衣脫下交我掛起，惟覺衣服頗沉重。渠將褲子及襯衫上血跡均用濕毛巾揩去，即坐下問我能不能把金條換成美鈔。渠似急需錢用。我將他帶至亨利路謝姓家，謝不在家，廢然而返。</p>
<p>不報警局原因</p>
<p>庭上此時嚴詰！「你旣將殺人責任都推在馬萊身上，爲何不向警察局報吿，以减輕你的責任。却利以輕鬆之語調答稱：「余馬兩人都是我的朋友，余被馬所殺害，我心裏很不開心，沒有想到報吿警察局」。嗣供稱：由家中出來，我開車送馬萊至跑馬廳總會，後我單獨將車送還派屈洛夫，共三個鐘點，由我付出二十九萬元。再由派屈洛夫駕車，先將馬萊送至百老匯大廈，然後由派送我回家。九時十分我領　前往金門電影院看電影。翌日下午，馬萊至我家晤談，渠問金條可有法調現鈔否，同時拿出一根金條。庭上詢以是否即係余盛孝的。答不知道，又稱：我吿渠沒有辦法，此後即未見馬萊來訪。對車中有無血跡事，則稱幷未發現。供至此，庭上命却利坐於一旁。</p>

<h3>憑證購汽油　發現有舞弊　用戶購貯油站抬價　趙局長稱決予取締</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕公用局長趙曾珏，昨在市府會議室接見各報記者，報吿自本市實施汽車憑證購油後，發現舞弊情事，及公用局之處置辦法，略稱：（一）自本市實施憑證購油後，各汽車站皆擁擠不堪，且發現本市之用油量，反較未實行憑證購油前增加。究其原因，純係市民之恐懼心理使然。市民皆認爲本市汽油必將恐慌，於是羣相爭購，且圖貯藏家中。公用局認爲此種現象極不合理，旦易造成火災危險，故決予嚴查取締，若查得用戶有不合理用油現象時，決吊銷其購油證。（二）少數加油站，發現有舞弊現象，未能將配得汽油盡量供應，而將汽汕以黑市價格出售圖利，公用局決嚴厲取締。業經查獲者有復興中路五五一號之亞細亞油站，已罰令停業一月懲戒。（三）汽油憑證購油辦法之擬訂，事先曾徵得油公司之同意，然實施以後，各汕公司皆有怨言，公用局決於明日召集油公司負責人，對本辦法作再度檢討。最後趙局長希望市民能體諒政府苦衷，精誠合作，相互監督，發揮其力量</p>

<h3>節約委會討論七項規程　私人汽車欲限制　環境複雜困難多</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市各界節約運動委員會昨日舉行常務委員會。由吳市長主席，出席沈宗濂，徐寄廎，宣鐵吾，趙曾珏，陸幹臣，王冠靑，傳曉峰，潘公展（項昌權代），杜月笙（朱文德代），方治（毛注淸代），吳開先（袁文彰代），曹俟等十餘人。會中就行政院所頒佈之七項節約規程，根據本市現實環境加以討論，決定實施步驟，並按需要略加修正或補充。茲綜合其討論結果如下：（一）厲行節約消費辦法綱要，照原來條文無異議。（二）節約督導委員會組織規程，無異議。（三）私人使用汽車限制辦法，其中第三條中規定：得使用私人汽車者爲（一）依法登記註册之醫師。（二）依法登記註册之銀行工廠礦塲新聞報社及規模宏大與民生日用必需品有關之民營事業。（三）依法核准登記之汽車運輸業。又第五條規定，凡不合上項規定者，應分期抽籤核减。然因本市環境複雜，實行時恐有困難，故會中僅互相交換意見，未作任何決定。</p>
<h3>中西筵席限制　特別嚴厲執行</h3>
<p>（四）筵席消費節約實施辦法中，應特別注重並嚴厲執行者，爲第二條：「中餐每席不得超過六菜一湯，西餐每客不得超過二菜一湯，並由當地政府依當地物價限制每客之最高價格。」及第四條：「凡政府禁止輸入之飲食物品，在餐館內不准售賣「如魚翅，燕窩，洋酒等）。」此外會中並決定司機或隨從，以客人自理爲原則，主人得供給客飯，司機及隨從不得有任何需索。（五）新聞紙雜誌及書籍用紙節約辦法，除遵照原文規定：報紙篇幅在一張以上者縮爲一張，二張以上者不得超過二張外，並決定新創報紙及雜誌，在一年以內不發登記證，已呈准登記而目前不發刊者，不准復刊。期刊之篇福照原文之規定，週刊十六頁，半月刊三十二頁，月刊六十四頁，並由社會局令飭各印刷業遵照辦理。（六）厲行守時運動實施辦法，無異議。（七）厲行節約消費檢察辦法，決由市黨部召集市參議會，靑年國，新運會，敎育會等機關商討實施之。</p>

<h3>滬杭綫　度白露</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州十六日訊〕記者此次奔跑在滬杭綫上，問過經騐宏富的老晨，人民代表的參議員，農業專家，縣政人員，他們對於今年的秋收，未敢奢望。</p>
<p>白露雨　偸稻鬼</p>
<p>據有經騐的老農說：「白露雨偸稻鬼（諧舉）」白露那一天下雨以後，處處都要發生虫災，例如嘉善等地已經有虫患發現了。又有諺云：「白露雨，到一處，壞一處」。凡是經過白露雨的地方，休想有一個好的收成。大概在白露的時節，正是稻子秀花的時候，秀花以後，才可結實，秀花的天氣，最好是陰晴，如果出大太陽，要把花逼死，如果是下雨，花受了潮，容易起變化，所以白露前後下雨，老農的經騐吿訴我們是不好的。但據有些人說：「「白露雨霏霏，秋分稻修齊」，這就是白露天下雨不大，濛濛的飄着，對於田稻還有利的，我又曾請敎於農業專家，據他說：「白露天下雨是壞的，完全沒有科學的根據。」我們且不管白露天的雨是好是壞，但在農村間普遍流佈着一種可怕的經驗傳說，農胞們會不會因着這種傳說而灰心呢？這就是要政府人員努力想就補救的辦法。推廣，宣傳到鄕村中去，以期作有效的挽救。</p>
<p>秋收好百業隹</p>
<p>目前滬杭綫上，除了上海以外，可以說每一個城鎮，都在期望着秋收，秋收好了，一切都有辦法，像嘉禮善的磚瓦，大城市當然很少人造房子，但是秋收以後，鄉下農村，有些要添房造屋的，磚瓦業也訐可以乘機而興。像楓涇土布，硤石洋襪，長安紗布，無一不是熟望着秋收以後讓農村大量的採購，即是每一城鎭的商業也在等待農胞們能够有一點盈餘，可以換去一點貨品。我們瞻望今年的秋收，還待大家的努力，我們期求秋收以後，米價不要貶得太低，不要待秋收農村售出穀子以後，又聽見「穀賤塲農」的呌喊！</p>
<p>滬杭綫上各農村間存在着的另一問題，就是客民屯墊的問題，我會走訪過三四個縣，他們都在討論客民屯墾的問題。所謂客民，即是浙江上八府麗的山民，或是江蘇北區的人民，他們有的是勤勞克苦的習慣，屯墾的時候，總要比當地的農民生產能力來得强，於是激起當地農民的暗潮，我認爲這些小問題，當地的政府應該迅予解決，不應該再讓它存留着的。</p>
<p>耕　地免荒蕪</p>
<p>客民，家民，原本是江浙兩省的人，是自己人，也是中華民國的國民，我們行見滬杭鐵路綫兩傍還存在很多荒地，這些荒地，可由政府按着地政的法規公告認領，迅予改良，如果還是讓他荒蕪的，不妨招由客民認墾。我　考查客民與家民的糾紛，不是在荒地的學墾，而是在熟地的耕植。現在當庶的江南還有不少的荒地，應該獲取「地盡其利」的墾植機會。</p>
<p>移墳棺　辦公墓</p>
<p>要墾荒地，又有一個問題，就是墳棺的移葬，我主張應該即刻辦理公墓，所有一切棺木，都要移葬到公墓中，不再讓它星羅棋佈，使墾荒者無法下手。</p>
<p>從秋收，想到了「穀賤傷農」，因着「穀賤傷農」，想到了屯墾的問題。屯墾，是可以增加生產的，我們爲政的人和人民的代表，應該把這一連串的問題研究研究，眞正的爲着人民做一些事。（特派員儲裕生）</p>

<p>〔山東滋陽柳小姐來函〕編輯先生：我是一個十八歲受過高小敎育未出閨閣的女孩子。我於三十四年冬，認識了一位男朋友，其品格學識等等，都合乎我的理想，於是由友誼而戀愛，我的母親亦很同情我們，許可我自由，與對方結合，我的父親早就去世，但我的祖父母封建思想十分濃厚，不但限制我的自由，而且不許我與對方約會通信，我雖然在這種惡劣環境下，兩年過程中，亦不斷的與對方通信，約會密談，現在我與我的愛人處於情深愛熱之時，已自行訂立婚前草約，今有數點，懇乞賜予明確指示，（一）我與對方訂婚，並徵得我母親同意，在法律上是否有效？（二）若我祖父母來干涉，我以何法理辯論？（三）對方已有妻室，他允許我與其妻均受同等待遇，（不分大小謂之一門兩不絕）此事我亦甘心情願，在法律上是否有效？（四）如再有他人向我祖父母給我介紹丈夫，不徵求我同意，我是否能拒絕？此請勛安讀者柳淸岫拜懇九月八日</p>
<p>〔本欄答〕柳小鑒：查民法規定，婚約應由男女當事人自行訂定。不過未成年人（滿二十歲爲成年）訂定婚約，應得法定代理人之同意。（父母爲其未成年子女之法定代理人）您今年十八歲，尙未成年，如與人訂定婚約，應徵得父母之同意。至令祖父母自無權干涉。但您的男朋友，旣有妻室，那就大有問題了。您雖甘心情願。其奈決所不許何！民法第九八五條規定：「有配偶者不得重婚」。刑法第二三七條規定：「有配偶而重爲婚姻或同時與二人以上結婚者，處五年以下有期徒刑，其相婚者亦同。」所以，最明智的辦法，莫如「懸　勒萬」，重行物色理想的伴侶，事關終身幸福，千萬不可自誤！</p>

<h3>「九一八」談日本人</h3>
<p>由「九一八」「一二八」「七七」到「八一三」，日本人走着一條路綫：侵入中國，吸吮中國人的血液，使自己强大起來，在太平洋，在亞洲稱　爲王。</p>
<p>但十六年來，這個侵略軍國的迷夢，並沒有醒。日本人在二年前，戰敗了，雖然形式上被解除了武裝，但日本人固有的精神上的武器以及軍國主義的骨骼，並沒有拆除！</p>
<p>「神明之子」的天皇，始終保存着，他就是日本人侵略的偶像，也是日本向外發展的「信號台」。天皇雖然披上了平民的衣衫，但是他是軍國主義日本人民的靈魂。</p>
<p>日本的秘密警察以及權力的機構，實質上並未解體，原來的人馬與獲有戰功的軍閥，依然站在隱晦之處，指示着日本人民再圖奮起的方向。</p>
<p>日本的輕工業及財閥們的經濟機構，不單不被破壤，而且在使日本經濟自足自給的鼓勵情形下，它們正在邁步向前。</p>
<p>這些責任，雖然可以譴責美國的統帥——麥克阿瑟，但是管制日本的盟國，應該在紀念「九一八」十六年的今天，提出强硬的糾正！</p>
<p>假如不是如此，那麼，日本人再在中國或太平洋發動另一個「九一八」，並不是不可能的事情。</p>
<p>最少，它的經濟侵略，在它戰敗後的二年，槍頭已經指向中國！</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「九一八」感言</h3>
<p>— 志偉</p>
<p>今日爲「九一八」十六週年紀念日，自民國十七年以來，日本帝國主義積極向吾國藉口挑釁，橫施壓力，繼「五三」事件後又有「萬寳山」事件，「中村」事件，以爲「九一八」事變的導火綫，「九一八」以後，又有「一二八」之役，「楡關」之役，「熱河」之役，「長城」之役，「成都」「北海」事件及至「　溝橋」事變，乃激起我們中國全面的抗戰，經八年的英舅抗戰，我國終於獲得勝利。軍國主義的日本業已屈膝於正義旗轍之下，論理吾人應以最愉快的情緒來抑接這一個偉大的紀念日—一個富含敎訓意味的紀念日，但是處於今日環境下之吾人，却百感交集，感慨萬端，眞不知從何處說起</p>
<p>勝利二年後的日本，趨向復興的神速，在近代史上，實無倫比，即德國亦不免相形見拙，望塵莫及，今日的日本，不僅日本人民的意識上，幾已不復承認自己爲戰敗國家，對於贖武主義與天皇制度，仍一味崇拜，即使對於近代史最重要一個轉捩點—日本代表在美艦簽訂　　的一幕，亦恐早已淡忘，侵略野心又圖死灰復燃，想重溫「大東亞共榮圈」的舊夢。</p>
<p>對日和約尙未成立，而日本私人對外貿易，却巳自八月十五日起開放了。以及最近日本甲級戰犯多人竟以「暫時已將域犯的嫌疑洗刷淸楚」爲理由，無條件開釋了……。總之，麥帥對待日本，過度寬容，跡近放縱，須知這種寬容政策，將來足以引起不可測的後患，或許有一天，日本將審訊投擲原子炸彈的戰犯咧！</p>
<p>「九一八」事變在我國歷史上是血的敎訓，它在民族心靈上，是永遠不能忘懷的，且使吾人加深了「公理戰勝」的信念，吾人緬懷過去，面對現實，則誰又能保證將來不致爲重演「九一八」？吾人必須警惕，毋忘「九一八」血的敎訓，切記「二十年後再來」的臨別贈言。</p>
<h3>介紹給全滬學生：　叔蘋獎學金</h3>
<p>— 歌樂山</p>
<p>七月七日王燃　先生「學店插曲」一文，吿訴了我們許多獎學金的內幕，均係滑頭騙局，而在　報名費。王光生更以爲上海決沒有大慈善家能救濟淸寒子弟三百名之多，那我却不以爲然，因爲我所知道的叔蘋公獎學金，就是王先生意料之外的。叔蘋公獎學金自創辦得獎的同學，已有一千人之多，而下學期繼續須帮助的，約有三百五十人左右。</p>
<p>叔蘋公獎學金是　乾麟先生在民國廿八年創辦的，到今天已是整整八年了。顧先生的創辦叔蘋公獎學金，是爲了紀念他先考顧公叔蘋，更爲了救濟失學的優秀靑年。</p>
<p>叔蘋公獎學金本來是只限於高初中的，但現在很多大學的同學仍繼續得到獎金的帮助。叔蘋公獎學金除學雜費獎金之外，還有書　費獎金，成績挺優秀的，更能有膳宿費獎金。任何淸寒子弟都能去申請，假使你的成績合了獎學金的標準——平均八十五分，而在叔蘋公獎學金的甄別考試合格後，你就能開始得獎金。在你得到獎金後，如不懈怠於學業，那末獎金會帮助你到大學畢業是不成問題的。</p>
<p>叔蘋公獎金有許多有到於得獎同學的設施，如圖書館，免費理髮部，實騐室，速記班，打字班……等等，不勝枚舉。叔蘋公獎學金更爲了同學的健康，請有優良醫師，免費為同學治療各種疾病。</p>
<p>（筆者係叔蘋公獎學金得獎學生之一，故對叔蘋獎金內幕頗熟悉，上述一切均係事實。）</p>

<h3>九一八事變中　最先抗敵的部隊</h3>
<p>— 梅蕪</p>
<p>九一八事變，殺早和日軍接觸而加抵抗的，是更北軍第七旅，轄六一九，六二〇，六二一三個團，駐紥在北大營。日軍進攻的部隊分三大隊，第二隊撲東大營，第三隊撲省城，火力最猛的第一隊則撲北大營，因當時北大營在東北爲最大兵營，敵人也頗畏懼</p>
<p>日軍分五綫進攻，步兵領先，重砲在後掩護，機槍彈發，有如爆豆。長先侵入東北角，六二一團猝不及防，倉皇應戰，損失慘重，不久日軍又從西南角侵入，第七旅旅部及六一九團抵不住日軍熾烈火力，不得已退出營外，其餘部隊相繼撤退。</p>
<p>此時日軍已四成合圍，而六二〇團尙留營內，乃血戰突圍，至十九日晨方完全退出。在此小規模戰鬥中，六二〇團犧牲極大，日軍傷亡亦最重。</p>
<p>北大營失陷後，東大營勢孤援絕，士兵整隊撤退，痛哭失聲，由此亦可覘知當時士兵心理。</p>
<p>水滸駢枝</p>
<h3>刺朽</h3>
<p>— 愛竹</p>
<p>在水滸傳中有好幾個人受到刺配某州牢城的懲罰。「刺」是刺面，「配」是配身。在古代刺面稱爲黥，把犯人臉上留一個不能消滅的記號，然後罰他作苦工。自秦漢以來直到三國，政府所有的官奴婢臉上都刺着記號的，以後却似乎不大通行。宋朝刺配的辦法興其說是因「刺」而「配」，倒不如說因「配」而刺。那時刺面是當兵的記號，並不問這個兵士是志願兵，募兵，或是拉來的壯丁，犯罪的囚徒，照例都得刺上幾個字。宋江，林冲，武松之流所以要刺字，只因爲把他們「配」了「軍」。</p>
<p>這一種辦法始於唐末，朱全忠和劉守光的軍隊都是如此，原因自然在防止軍士開小差。自此以後直到宋朝承用不廢，沿襲了三百年之久。因此之故，一當了兵就永遠不能改行，受盡了人間的輕視如凌蔑，兵士之是否出於犯人是無法判別的，這好像說兵士都曾犯過法似的。在宋仁宗時爲了防禦西　，　　軍不敷分配，於是臨時又徵集好多沿邊的壯丁，組織「義勇軍」，當時聲明單刺手而不刺面。可是那位著名的賢相韓琦最後仍然極力主張非刺面不可，范仲淹却極力反對，結果韓琦管下的壯丁刺了面，範仲淹管下的便幸免了。</p>
<p>「英雄不論出身低」，在刺字的兵士中居然也有人靠着邊庭上一刀一槍爬到執政的地位，這便是赫赫大名的狄靑。宋朝本來就重文輕武，而武人之中由行伍出身的更沒有發跡的希望，狄靑的得意在當時實是破例。據說他得勝回朝，論功行賞，宰相商量只加他節度使的虛銜，後來皇帝看不過，替他抱不平，把宰相責備了一頓，纔議他做破天荒的刺面　密使。儘管他官做得大，人家還是瞧他不起，那一次他和韓琦一起領兵出征，有一個將領觸犯了韓琦，韓琦要殺他狄靑上去保他，說這個將領是條好漢。韓琦當下就板起臉來說：「狀元及第從東華門裏邊唱名出來的才是好漢，他算什麼！」韓琦瞧不起這個倒霉的將領，也就是瞧不起狄靑。狄靑出來歎氣道：「我和韓公官職一般，就只少了個進士罷了」。其實狄靑雖然吃了刺面的虧，他的內心倒是有點以此自喜的。當時有一位國舅爺也是行伍出身，險上刺着字，後來他的妹妹進官得寵，他也就平地一聲雷，做了大官—這種親戚裙帶關係自然又當別論，狄青却只靠軍功，所以說是破例。這位國舅爺想盡方決找醫生把臉上字滅掉，據說頗有效騐，他生得又胖又白，把刺字一滅掉，居然是富貴之相。有人勸狄靑不妨找醫生試試，狄靑却說：」我要讓弟兄們知道刺面也能發達，不願把牠滅去」。他在閱兵時有時指着臉對兵隊說：「瞧我罷！只要打仗勇敢那怕不富貴！」又據說他在作戰時臉上老帶上一個面具，我想這也許和刺面有關，他不願意敵人知道他的出身。</p>
<p>狄靑當樞密使時，人家編了個童謠害他說：「漢似胡兒胡似漢，家在扮河草子邊」，上一句隱射「狄」字，下一句隱射籍貫和「靑」字，作爲他造反的預言。又有一次對門起火，有人報吿親見狄靑穿了黃襖子指揮救火。黃襖子自然隱射黃袍加身，而指揮救火也含有他想乘機起事的意思。結果他遭受了各方面的攻擊放了外任出京了。不久他氣成了病，不步延醫服藥，就此鬱鬱而亡。</p>

<h3>Unified Organization of Party and Youth League; First Meeting of the Central Executive Committee; Amendments to the Organizational Regulations of the Central Departmental Committees</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The first meeting of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee after the unification of party and youth league organizations was held at 9 a.m. on the 18th. President Chiang personally presided over the meeting. Song Ziwen reported the donation of all his personal investment shares in the China Construction Bank as a fund to relieve the families of party members who died in the war of resistance and the suppression of bandits. The entire audience applauded unanimously. Song's report was read by Secretary Zhang Shou Xian. The President greatly appreciated Song's actions. Following this, the committee discussed the proposal by Committee Member Song and 40 others at the Fourth Plenary Session to organize the Chinese Kuomintang Comrades Mutual Aid Association, raise mutual aid funds, and promote the work of rescuing comrades. It was resolved to hand it over to the Finance Committee to formulate specific implementation measures and submit them to the next Standing Committee meeting. The following were then passed: (1) Amendments to the Organizational Outline of the Central Executive Committee, (2) Organizational Regulations of the Youth Department, (3) Organizational Regulations of the Theoretical Research Committee, and (4) General Rules for the Organization of the Central Departmental Committees. Furthermore, regarding the proposal submitted by the Fourth Plenary Session to the Standing Committee to appoint a number of people to establish a research committee responsible for studying and improving the organization of the party, it was also resolved that the Youth Committee for the unification of party and youth league organizations would be responsible for the research. Finally, the President proposed the appointment of Chen Xueping as the Minister of the Youth Department and Liang Hancao as the Chairman of the Theoretical Research Committee, which was unanimously approved by the entire audience.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] A reporter today interviewed the newly appointed Minister of the Youth Department of the Kuomintang, Chen Xueping, to inquire about the department's future work direction. According to him: The focus of the department's work is on training. After eight years of resistance against the war and the armed rebellion of the communist bandits, the country is in a precarious state, society is unstable, and the economy is impoverished, causing young people to feel frustrated and painful. How should we guide young people to recognize the current situation and their own responsibilities and work together for a new China of the Three Principles of the People? This is the department's top priority. Chen has served in the education field and has been teaching at Peking University for 17 years. He was originally the Dean of Students at Peking University.</p>
<h3>Report by Standing Committee Member Song Ziwen on Property Donation; Detailed Account of the China Construction Bank's Situation</h3>
<p>Chairman, fellow comrades, at last week's Fourth Plenary Session, the President had already announced that Ziwen and others initiated the raising of funds to relieve the families of party members who died in the war of resistance and the suppression of bandits. He also mentioned that Ziwen had decided to contribute all the shares in the major investment projects of the China Construction Bank, such as the Huainan Mining and Railway Company, the Po Le Coal Mine Company, the Yangtze Electric Company, and the Hankou Jiji Hydroelectric Company, for this fund.</p>
<p>Today, at this meeting, I will submit a report on the operations of the China Construction Bank, because the outside world is mostly unaware of the situation of the bank, and there may even be misunderstandings.</p>
<p>In 1933, after I resigned from the position of Minister of Finance, I engaged in industrial and commercial enterprises, because at that time I was concerned with two issues. First: How can we encourage the inflow of large amounts of foreign capital under conditions acceptable to the Chinese people, and how can we obtain assistance from foreign technology management? Second, how can we promote the development of the domestic capital market? Without these two, our country's industry will not be able to make large-scale progress.</p>
<p>In the past, almost all of our country's foreign debts had to be secured by tax revenues, such as customs duties and salt taxes, which were managed by foreigners due to loan relationships. As for railway loans, there were often provisions for foreign supervision or joint management. The Four-Power Banking Consortium was still unable to succeed in lending to our country, and at that time, the company organization of our country's industry and commerce was in its infancy. Most industrial and commercial enterprises were operated in the form of private individuals, families, or partnerships. Once personnel changes occurred, the enterprise would decline. A true capital market was still lacking. All enterprises relied almost entirely on short-term loans for turnover, without the convenience of a long-term bond market.</p>
<p>In order to solve the above two problems, with the support of comrades in the party and friends in the banking industry, I launched the organization of the China Construction Bank to become the first true investment company in our country. Until the start of the War of Resistance, the bank had made many contributions to attracting foreign capital and establishing a domestic capital market.</p>
<h3>In the Past, Foreign Capital Was Attracted and Industrial Construction Was Promoted</h3>
<p>Foreign capital is willing to participate in our country's market as long as our country has a credible partner to cooperate with, jointly participate in its investment, protect its interests, and share its operating risks, that is, willing to abandon the conditions that have damaged our country's sovereignty in the past. Since the establishment of the China Construction Bank in 1934, it has been adapting to this need.</p>
<p>In 1936, the China Construction Bank cooperated with the British-Chinese Bank and the HSBC to establish the British-Gold Loan for the completion of the Hangzhou-Ningbo section of the railway. Before the War of Resistance in 1937, two loans were established. One was intended to be used to build the railway from Pukou to Xiangyang, and the other was to build the railway from Guangzhou to Meixian, but both were suspended due to the war. In addition, the bank also borrowed from the British on behalf of the Jiangxi Provincial Government to establish a hydroelectric plant in Nanchang.</p>
<p>The China Construction Bank's cooperation with France has been even more successful. On the French side, four banks, including Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas, Banque de l'Indochine, Lazard Brothers, and Banque Franco-Chinoise, organized a French banking syndicate to cooperate with the bank in the construction of Chinese railways and the development of minerals. In December 1936, the French banking syndicate signed a loan agreement with the bank and the Ministry of Communications to supply the materials needed for the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Our country was responsible for the funds needed domestically. When the War of Resistance broke out, all the land for the entire line had been purchased, and all the tunnels had been completed. Even the bridges and roadbeds had been completed.</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, the bank's efforts to develop our country's economy did not stop. After the fall of Shanghai and Nanjing, the government took the southwest as the base of the War of Resistance, so it negotiated with the French to establish the railway from Nanning to Zhennanguan to connect to Vietnam. This project was mostly completed, but unfortunately it was suspended due to the enemy's invasion of southern Guangxi.</p>
<p>The Xukun Railway was an even larger-scale plan. The agreement was signed in 1939, and it was planned to connect Kunming to Xufu in Sichuan to connect to the Yangtze River. At the same time, plans for the development of minerals along the line were also discussed.</p>
<p>The focus of American economic development in China is not on railways, but on industry. Therefore, the bank has consulted with the American business community on plans for the manufacture of rayon, paper, fertilizer, trucks, and rubber. Except for the cooperation with the American Rubber Company to manufacture rubber products, other plans have been temporarily suspended. The bank's operating purpose is to raise funds to promote the establishment of various industries so that they can operate independently, contribute to society, and facilitate the progress of investment in all aspects.</p>
<p>From the progress of the above-mentioned past undertakings, it can be seen that the China Construction Bank's attraction of foreign capital is no longer subject to the conditions of using tax revenue as collateral, and the supervision or joint management of business by foreigners. If it is necessary to use foreign technology and management assistance for various construction projects, the personnel it employs are still responsible to the national personnel in charge of the project, and there are no special regulations due to debt.</p>
<h3>The Establishment of a Domestic Market Has Achieved Considerable Success</h3>
<p>It has already been mentioned that our country's economic development has been greatly hindered due to the lack of a capital market.</p>
<p>The general public in our country has hardly any interest in company stocks, except for the rubber stocks in the early years of the Republic of China and the stocks of exchange trust companies around 1920, which had intermittent speculative fever. Before the war, the Shanghai Stock Exchange, except for government bond transactions, had no stocks listed. The reason is that the stocks of various exchanges failed one after another in the past, resulting in a loss of faith in the stock exchange itself. At the same time, companies with status despised the exchange, thinking that once their stocks were listed on the exchange, they would have a speculative color, which would damage the company's own status. At that time, the stock exchange, in order to save the situation, specially negotiated with the bank for assistance, willing to transfer half of the stocks to the bank, and asked the bank to reorganize the internal affairs on its behalf, so that companies with status would be willing to list their stocks on the exchange, and asked the bank to negotiate with financial institutions to provide loans to brokers. Both parties had already reached an agreement on this method, but it was suspended due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance. In 1945, when I was the President of the Executive Yuan, the institute raised the old matter again, still willing to fulfill the previous agreement. Since I had already taken up a government position, I specially negotiated with the bank to give up this right, and transferred all the stocks that should have been obtained to the state bank. After that, the institute was reorganized, reopened stock trading, and the business was very good, and the profits were huge, which is obvious to all, but I and the bank have no regrets, because giving up this right is a matter of course.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1936, the government decided on a policy that the scope of operations for various construction projects should be limited to industries that are not suitable for private investment, such as national defense industries, trunk railways, and hydropower generation. In accordance with this policy, the Construction Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, was gradually reducing its business group and planned to change the affiliated completed projects that were not under state-owned jurisdiction to private ownership. At that time, the bank was the only institution that could bear this undertaking, so it was entrusted to sell the Huainan Coal Mine and Railway, the Capital and Ganyu factories of the committee. After the bank was entrusted, it organized the South Mining and Railway Company and the Yangtze Electric Company (this is unrelated to the Yangtze Construction Company), published advertisements to raise shares, and soon the matter was completed. Unfortunately, due to the outbreak of the war, some subscribers failed to pay according to the subscribed amount. The bank was responsible for the underwriting, and had to purchase them on its own and bear the risks caused by the war. This is the reason why the bank became a major shareholder of the Huainan Mining and Railway and Yangtze Electric Companies, and at that time, the original intention was only to retain a small number so that it could participate in the management of the two companies.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1937, the business operation of Hankou Jiji Hydroelectric Company was difficult, because the bank had many technical personnel, it was also invited to participate in the share capital and reorganize the operation, which was also successful.</p>
<p>In addition, the bank raised a batch of corporate bonds for Shanghai Wing On Company with a term of ten years to pay off its short-term bank debts. It also raised a batch of US dollar bonds for the opening of Huangpu Port in Guangdong, and another batch of municipal bonds for Qingdao's municipal construction.</p>
<p>Based on the above facts, it is known that the bank achieved considerable success in both the dual tasks of attracting foreign capital and building a domestic capital market before the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the War of Resistance had not occurred in our country, six new railways could have been built in a short period of time, and other important industries could have been developed. Compared with the fact that no railway was completed with the assistance of foreign capital in the twenty years from 1914 to 1934, the difference cannot be measured in distance.</p>
<h3>Amendments to the Provisions of the Veto Right: I Agree with the American Proposal</h3>
<p>[Our News] New York, 18th Broadcast: China stated today that it agrees with the American proposal to amend the provisions of the veto right of the five powers in the United Nations Security Council. Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, the chief representative of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, stated in his speech that although the proposal to amend the provisions of the veto right will help the future of the United Nations, amending or canceling the veto right is not enough to completely solve the difficulties currently facing the United Nations organization. If the tendency of countries around the world to split into groups is not fundamentally eliminated, the basic threat to the United Nations organization will still exist. Wang did not mention Marshall's proposal yesterday to establish a special organization to promote world peace and security.</p>
<h3>The President Receives Xue Guangqian, Inquiring About the Political and Economic Situation in Europe in Detail</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] President Chiang received Xue Guangqian, the minister of the embassy in Italy who had recently returned to the country, at his official residence on Huangpu Road at 5 p.m. on the 18th and talked for about half an hour. The President inquired in detail about the general political and economic situation in the Balkans and Europe. Xue participated in the United Nations Balkan Dispute Investigation Team at the beginning of the year on behalf of China, traveled through the Balkan countries for half a year, and recently returned to the country via the United States. He has a deep understanding of the current international situation.</p>
<h3>The Treatment of Public Educators Has Already Touched the Hunger Line; Supervisory Committee Members All Agree That They Should Not Be Concerned About Rice, Oil, Salt, and Other Basic Necessities</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] The issue of the treatment of public educators was discussed in detail at a talk held by the Supervisory Yuan on the morning of the 18th. More than 20 supervisory committee members attended and spoke enthusiastically. The meeting recognized that the lives of public educators today are on the verge of starvation. The monthly income of low-level civil servants is only 500,000 to 600,000, which is less than 12 or 13 yuan before the war. Even in terms of the supervisory committee members themselves, the income is only about 30 yuan before the war. After work, they are almost entirely troubled by firewood, rice, oil, and salt. They have no time to take care of their lives or deaths, which will affect work efficiency. On the other hand, many government officials use various conveniences to enjoy themselves to the fullest. Some only come to Nanjing once or twice a week to attend meetings, but they have giant houses in Nanjing, use cars, and have more than a dozen servants at their disposal, all of which are provided by the public. What could be more unfair? Some members of the Legislative Yuan have suggested holding civil servant loans. When this is implemented, there will be many difficulties. At the same time, if the government has money for loans, why not use it directly to increase salaries? However, adjusting treatment at this time will only increase issuance and stimulate prices. Those who benefit may not necessarily be civil servants, which is not a good strategy. As a result of the talks, the following two points were summarized: (1) From the bottom up, the government should not let civil servants worry about firewood, rice, oil, salt, and other basic necessities, so that they no longer struggle on the verge of starvation. (2) From the top down, those in high positions should share weal and woe with their subordinates. The government advocates thrift, and low-level personnel have no savings to save at all. Everything should be advocated by those in power. It is said that Zuo Zuoyi's successful military governance lies in his ability to share weal and woe with his soldiers. This kind of atmosphere should be extended to all parties. At the meeting, the committee also recommended that Gan Weiyuan, Shude, draft a proposal for formal submission to the government.</p>

<h3>President Zhang Will Fly to Peiping This Morning; Will Inspect Tianjin, Shenyang, Changchun, and Other Places; Collect Various Data and Pay Attention to Corruption Cases</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] Premier Zhang Qun will inspect North China and the Northeast and is scheduled to depart on the morning of the 19th. If preparations are not completed in time, he will fly to Beiping on the 20th to inspect the areas of Peiping, Tianjin, Changchun, Shenyang, Taiyuan, and other places. In addition to inspecting the administration of officials and visiting the people, he will also pay special attention to corruption cases in various places.

[Another dispatch] Zhang Qun is scheduled to go on an inspection tour on the 19th and will collect information on military, political, educational, and social aspects, with particular emphasis on provincial and municipal administration.

<h3>Special Envoy Wedemeyer Flies Back to Washington; Will Submit an Investigation Report to the President Immediately</h3>
<p>[United Press, Fairfield Airport, California, 17th] General Wedemeyer arrived at the Army Airport here on the 17th from Honolulu. Wedemeyer stayed in Honolulu for a week to prepare a report to Truman on the situation in China and Korea. He declined to comment and patted his briefcase, saying that all the tricks were in it. Wedemeyer flew to San Francisco shortly after landing and will fly to Washington at 7 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. According to estimates by the State Department in Washington, Wedemeyer may arrive at 11:30 a.m. on the 18th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington] Wedemeyer is scheduled to fly to Washington today to report to Truman on the results of the investigation conducted by the inspection team he led in China and Korea. His proposals are expected to shape American policy in China. Truman is scheduled to return from a visit to Brazil on the 20th. Upon his return to Washington, he is expected to immediately discuss the situation in China with Wedemeyer.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 18th] Regarding Sun Ke's warning, qualified American personnel here said on the 18th: "This statement is unlikely to change the State Department's decision on China policy." Sun Ke said that if the United States continues to lead China astray, China will reconcile with the Soviet Union. This statement should be regarded as diplomatic bluffing and is not enough to change the position of the Wedemeyer mission. However, the American personnel hope to see the original text of the United Press before believing that Sun made this statement, fearing that there may be errors when printed in the Chinese newspapers here.</p>
<p>A semi-official Chinese source told the United Press that Sun often has emotional impulses when talking, so his statement "does not represent the government's views." His statement was "a false reaction to Wedemeyer's public criticism of the Chinese government." Although Sun has recently made anti-Soviet remarks, comparing the Soviet Union with Japan, he was previously recognized as a promoter of pro-Soviet policies.</p>
<h3>Profiting by Relying on Privileges Is Pure Fiction</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, I was ordered to go to the United States to serve the country. After returning to the country in 1944, I was appointed as the President of the Executive Yuan and immediately dissolved all previous commercial relationships. I resigned from all the director positions of the original bank and other related companies. I also requested that the bank return the rights to the railway contracts obtained before the war to the government. At the same time, I asked it not to engage in any business related to the government during my tenure as the President of the Executive Yuan. The bank was able to faithfully fulfill my wishes. The most ridiculous thing is that the United Press in the United States issued a draft, saying that the bank used privileges to obtain huge amounts of foreign exchange from the government and profited from it. This matter was investigated by our government, and the result was that the bank only requested US$877.62 from the Central Bank after the victory of the War of Resistance for the purchase of typewriters and miscellaneous stationery. The amount was so small that it was almost unbelievable. It can be seen that the truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.</p>
<p>After the victory of the War of Resistance, the number of party members who died in the anti-Japanese and anti-communist wars was extremely large, and their families lacked care and their lives were difficult. All comrades in the party and I believe that it is necessary to donate funds for relief. The four companies of Huainan, Po Le, Yangtze, and Jiji now have huge assets. If the bank's shares in the four companies can be donated to the fund, it can be a basis for establishing it.</p>
<h3>It Is Believed That Other Shareholders Can Make the Same Contributions</h3>
<p>Before the war, the estimated coal reserves of the Huainan Coal Mine were only 20 million to 50 million tons. After the war, the company felt the urgent need for coal in the Yangtze River area and paid special attention to mineral exploration. It hired the famous geologist Dr. Xie Jiarong to conduct a wide-ranging survey in the surrounding areas. Through his efforts, new coalfields were discovered in Bagong Mountain, with abundant reserves, estimated to be no less than 600 million tons, and they are flat coal seams, which are easy to mine. They are only 214 kilometers away from Yuxikou on the Yangtze River, which is convenient for supplying Shanghai and the Yangtze River area. It is the most promising coal mine in our country. In addition, Huainan also has mining rights in Jiangsi Po Le, and cheap fuel can also be obtained in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in the future.</p>
<p>In the future, with the electricity of the Yangtze and Jiji Electric Companies and the coal of Huainan and Po Le, it will not be difficult to use cheap electricity to form a power grid in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou to develop the industrial construction of central China.</p>
<p>I am only one of the shareholders of the China Construction Bank. For the bank's investment in its coal mines and public utilities, I can only donate the portion of shares I own. However, I have exchanged opinions with many other shareholders. I firmly believe that the majority of shareholders of the company agree with this move and may be able to make the same contribution to the shares of the four companies held by the bank, so that the families of comrades who sacrificed for the country can be relieved.</p>

<h3>Regulations on Price Evaluation Implementation Methods Revised and Approved by National Economic Commission; State-Run Enterprise Management Law Submitted for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The National Economic Commission held a routine meeting on the afternoon of the 18th, chaired by Wang Yunwu, to discuss the following six important cases:</p>
<p>(1) Amendment to the Regulations on Price Evaluation Implementation Methods. The case was submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the main amendments were: (A) Adding "If it is necessary to evaluate prices in various counties and cities, the provincial government may designate their establishment, but it must be reported to the Executive Yuan for record." to the end of Article 1 of the original regulations. (B) The original Article 8 "except for edible salt" was revised to exclude those with special management agencies in the area where the designated management items are located. (C) Adding another paragraph to the original Article 13: When prices rise sharply, the price evaluation committee should investigate the reasons for the rise, and if there is any speculation or manipulation, it should report it to the local court for punishment according to law. Note: The main duties of the Price Evaluation Committee are: 1. To stabilize the selling price of major daily necessities; 2. To assist in reporting illegal pricing behaviors. It is organized by representatives of provincial and municipal government officials, public opinion organizations, chambers of commerce, trade unions, and security agencies. This case was passed and sent to the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>(2) State-Run Enterprise Management Law. This law is divided into finance, business, and personnel sections, and it was decided to submit it to Yu Hongjun, Weng Wenhao, Yu Dawei, Chen Qitian, Jian Guansan, etc. for review.</p>
<p>(3) Automatic Adjustment of Public Utility Prices Calculation Method. According to the original plan calculation, fuel prices, raw material prices, electricity prices, exchange rates, and wages are the standards. During the discussion of this case, the meeting was divided into two opinions. Jian Guansan, Xu Baiyuan, etc. opposed automatic adjustment, believing that it was contradictory to negotiate prices and adjust them automatically at the same time? Also, the base number is unreliable. It was decided to return it to Pan Xulun, Weng Wenhao, Chen Qitian, etc. for review, but public utilities that have reached the adjustment period can be adjusted.</p>
<p>(4) The Ministry of Economic Affairs submitted the Implementation Plan for Developing the Textile Industry and Regulating the Supply of Yarn and Cloth. The main purpose of the original plan is: to exchange cotton for yarn and yarn for cloth, divided into five major parts: (A) Ensuring abundant cotton raw materials, (B) Increasing the production of the textile industry, (C) Mastering yarn and cloth materials, (D) Rationally distributing yarn and cloth, (E) Promoting the export of yarn and cloth. During the discussion, most agreed that cotton yarn should be controlled to reduce speculation and hoarding, and it must not be stopped because some merchants object. A resolution was passed, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs was instructed to supervise the Textile Adjustment Committee to earnestly implement it.</p>
<p>(5) The Sino-US Agricultural Technology Cooperation Program for 1948 submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was decided to be submitted for review.</p>
<p>(6) The Implementation Methods of the Economic Reform Plan. Today, nine departments including water conservancy, land administration, food, transportation, industry, mining, labor-management, trade, and price have been submitted. It was decided that Chen Lifu, Xu Kan, Liu Jianqun, Huang Yuanbin, Chen Fang, Jian Guansan, Liu Zhendong, etc. would organize a comprehensive group to sort it out. Note: The implementation methods are divided into twelve parts, and eleven parts have been submitted. In addition to the above nine departments, the financial and monetary sectors were reviewed on the morning of the 18th.

<h3>Another Major Smuggling Case Cracked in Hong Kong; Xiangshan Wheel Discovered 50 Tons of Smuggled Goods</h3>

The seized contraband has already reached 30 tons, and customs officials estimate the total will reach more than 50 tons. On the night of the 17th, passengers and crew members on board held sticks to prevent inspectors from boarding the ship, so an emergency patrol team was called in to assist. The contraband included medicines, canned food, bicycles, oranges, cigarettes, and seafood.</p>
<h3>Postal, Telecommunications, and Railway Services All Suffering Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Remarks by Minister of Communications Yu Dawei</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Minister of Communications Yu Dawei told reporters on the 18th that postal, telecommunications, and railway services are all "suffering heavy losses." The postal and telecommunications industries rely entirely on subsidies to survive. If the subsidy system is cancelled next month, I really don't know how to face this problem. As for the recent situation of the railways, the Longhai Railway, when it is open, can maintain business due to the booming freight transport. However, the banditry in western Henan has spread, and the Luoyang-Shaanxi section has been severely damaged and is difficult to repair in the short term. Even the Jinpu and Jinghu lines have suffered heavy business losses. The Ministry of Communications has sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and strictly deal with the corruption case on the Yuehan Railway. When reporters asked whether postal and telecommunications rates would be raised again, Yu laughed and said that he also did not know.</p>
<h3>Opening of Sino-Japanese Air Route Awaiting Executive Yuan Approval</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's request to open a Sino-Japanese air route has been brewing for a long time. According to a person in charge of the Ministry of Communications: This matter is the beginning of the development of ocean voyages decided at the last maritime administration meeting. If China's shipping industry wants to seek long-term development, the ocean shipping industry must not be ignored. More ocean routes need to be opened in the future. Once the Sino-Japanese air route requested by the Bureau is submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, it can be formally prepared for navigation.</p>
<h3>Head of US Military Advisory Group, Rooks, Returns to Nanjing</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen's Righteous Act</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen, a member of the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang, suggested on the closing day of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee that a comrades' mutual assistance association be organized to raise funds to donate to the families of party members who died in the war of resistance and the suppression of bandits. Song Ziwen also took the lead in donating his private property, allocating all of his shares in the China Construction Bank Company as this fund. Song's move can be regarded as a symbol of the Kuomintang's rebirth. Therefore, once the news spread, it was welcomed by the whole country. However, what is the content of China Construction Bank Company? What is the value of Song's donated shares? These are all questions that the people of the country want to understand.</p>
<p>At the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday, Song made a detailed report to the meeting, saying that the tasks of China Construction Bank Company are: First, to absorb foreign investment as much as possible under conditions acceptable to the Chinese people, and to obtain foreign technical assistance; second, to promote the development of the domestic capital market, so as to enable large-scale improvements in China's industry. Since its establishment in the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), in addition to lending foreign debts to build railways, its main investment projects are four types: (1) Huainan Mining Railway Company; (2) Pole Coal Mine Company; (3) Yangtze Electrical Company; (4) Hankou Jiji Hydropower Company. From this, it can be seen that China Construction Bank Company is a common financial institution, but it is an important link in China's nation-building cause. In theory, these undertakings could have been operated by the state, but it is especially commendable to operate them as private enterprises and attract foreign investment. Song's righteous act of donating is not only to relieve the families of party members who died for the War of Resistance and the suppression of bandits, but also to return privately-run enterprises to public operation, which makes its significance especially important.</p>
<p>The Kuomintang overthrew the Manchu Qing Dynasty and created the Republic of China; overthrew Yuan Shikai and recreated the Republic; eliminated the warlords and completed unification; and defeated the Japanese invaders, writing off a century of unequal treaties with one stroke. This is the Kuomintang's great achievement for the country and the nation, which is enough to be immortalized forever and cannot be denied by anyone. However, the Kuomintang's achievements, in addition to thanking the leaders who have worked hard, must also be attributed to the martyrs and patriots who gave up their lives for righteousness and gave up their lives for benevolence. They are the real unsung heroes. Since they have sacrificed for the party and the country, the families they left behind should be responsible for by the party members who have not died. Otherwise, how can they be worthy of these martyrs? How can we encourage newcomers to sacrifice for the party and the country again? Therefore, Song's move can not only comfort the souls of the martyrs, but also encourage the surviving comrades. We fervently hope that all Kuomintang party members can follow the principle of "those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength" and respond enthusiastically. The wealthy should not be allowed to be solely responsible for the beauty of Song Ziwen. Even ordinary party members should donate as much as they can, no matter how much. All contributions are beneficial. The purpose of Song's proposal to launch this item will not be difficult to achieve if everyone is able to donate enthusiastically: The fate of the Kuomintang and China is already inseparable. On the one hand, we hope that the scope of relief for the families of the martyrs can be expanded, and one day it will not be limited to Kuomintang party members: on the other hand, we hope that people outside the Kuomintang will also donate to the country one after another.</p>
<p>In addition, after repeatedly reading Song's report to the Central Standing Committee, we have the following feelings:</p>
<p>First, China Construction Bank Company has always been quite isolated from the outside world, and very few people know its content. However, after reading Song Ziwen's report, we learned that the company is not an ordinary enterprise company or trade, buying cheap and selling expensive, and only seeking profit, but a true investment company aimed at developing industry. Its investment projects are not only closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, but also its purpose is to promote the improvement of Chinese industry. This point can be imitated by ordinary companies. Today, industry and commerce are declining, the people's livelihood is painful and unbearable, and idle funds are flooding the market. At present, ordinary businessmen raise funds to organize companies, if they do not hoard goods, they often engage in speculation. It seems that there are very few investors like China Construction Bank Company who engage in real business. Therefore, we hope that the Shanghai business community will organize companies in the future, and they can use idle funds and invest them in production enterprises, so that the rising prices can be slightly reduced.</p>
<p>Second, under the current circumstances, the only way for China to engage in nation-building and revitalization is to take the path of "self-reliance." The so-called self-reliance means that everyone in the country can achieve "self-discipline and patriotism" so that the national economy will not be in difficulty. What is the total value of Song's donated shares? It is difficult to estimate the exact number, but the Huainan coal mine has coal reserves of 600 million tons, and its value cannot be said to be small. In terms of shifting people's hearts, it has a great effect. In the past, China did not have large capitalists, but after eight years of war, as a result of inflation, many wealthy merchants emerged. Now that nation-building is difficult and the people are poor, the wealthy should generously donate, or use it as a relief fund, or use it as a nation-building investment. Song has set a precedent, and I hope that the people of the country will respond to the news.</p>
<p>Third, a month or two ago, foreign news agencies did not understand the truth and once widely spread the idea that privileged companies were using official exchange rates, and China Construction Bank Company was also involved. At that time, we were still unclear about the truth. Now, after reading Song's report, we can suddenly understand. We must first investigate the facts before we can judge any news in the future. We should take it as a great warning to say what others say.</p>

<h3>The United States Formally Submits the Korean Issue to the UN General Assembly; Proposes Organizing a Commission to Conduct On-Site Investigations of the General Situation; Will Take Unilateral Action if No Results Are Achieved</h3>
<p>[United States Information Service, Flushing, 18th] The United States today submitted two proposals to UN Secretary-General Lie, requesting that they be included on the agenda of the UN General Assembly. The first is to establish a temporary committee of the General Assembly on peace and security, and the second is to discuss the issue of Korean independence.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Authoritative sources here revealed to this agency that the content of the United States' proposal for resolving the Korean issue is approximately as follows: The United States will suggest to the United Nations to organize a commission to investigate the situation and supervise the early holding of elections in the North and South Korean occupied zones. In addition, it is further suggested that the results of this election will serve as the basis for determining the composition of the Central Assembly of all of Korea under the supervision of the United Nations. The United States will also suggest that the United Nations and the Korean Provisional Government determine the date for the withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea. Under the US plan, the Korean Provisional Assembly, in consultation with UN representatives, can then determine the procedures for drafting the Korean Constitution. The source also stated that, unless there are final changes to this plan, the United States will propose that the Korean Provisional Government and the United Nations Commission should decide on the scope and manner of economic recovery needed by Korea to restore its stability. At the same time, it is understood that if the United Nations cannot make progress on the issue of Korean independence, the United States will also prepare and request Congress for full financial assistance to South Korea.</p>
<p>[United Press, Seoul, 18th] The Soviet delegation of the US-Soviet Joint Commission today issued a statement condemning the United States for causing a stalemate on the Korean issue. It is claimed that the United States is nitpicking and deliberately refusing the Soviet proposal regarding which Korean political parties to consult in organizing a provisional government. The Soviet delegation insists on its original view that if both sides are willing to earnestly implement the Moscow Resolution, the Joint Commission will be able to smoothly resolve the Korean issue.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative to Counterattack Marshall's Speech at the General Assembly; US Proposal Has Received Majority Support</h3>
<p>[United Press, New York, 18th] Delegates from various countries are today closely awaiting the Soviet reaction to the US proposal to establish a 55-nation Security Committee at the UN General Assembly. The majority of small countries' representatives seem to be seeking to support the US proposal, and although the positions of China, Britain, and France have not been announced, it is feared that they will also take consistent action with the United States.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, New York, 18th] Soviet Chief Representative Vyshinsky is scheduled to launch a counterattack today in the UN General Assembly against Marshall's proposal to establish a 55-nation Standing Committee on "Peace and Security." Sources close to the Soviet delegation said that Vyshinsky's reasons for opposing the 55-nation Peace and Security Committee will be that this body is a redundant organization of the Security Council, sufficient to eliminate the Security Council's primary responsibility for maintaining world peace and security. Well-informed sources also anticipate that other points Vyshinsky will raise in the General Assembly include: (1) The internal turmoil in Greece was caused by US interference; (2) The US placing the Korean issue on the General Assembly agenda is a violation of the Four-Power Moscow Agreement; (3) The US proposal to abolish the application of the veto power in issues under Chapter VI of the Charter is a violation of the United Nations Charter; (4) The US refusal to agree to the Soviet Union's views on the control of atomic energy is the reason for the delayed establishment of the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Agency. In addition, it is expected that Vyshinsky will also criticize Argentina's disregard of the previous UN General Assembly resolution in appointing an ambassador to Madrid, and the refusal of Britain and the United States to comply with the previous UN General Assembly resolution on the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed within foreign territories.</p>
<h3>US Note to Soviets</h3>
<p>Copies Sent to Chinese and British Governments</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] The State Department today released the note sent last week to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, responding to his refusal to participate in the Four-Power talks on the Korean issue. It stated, in part, "Mr. Molotov, I have recently received your letter of September 4th, in which I understand that the Soviet government has decided to reject the US government's proposal to convene Four-Power talks to quickly realize the agreement related to the Korean issue in the Moscow Agreement. For the past two years, the US government has repeatedly shown sincerity in implementing this agreement with the Soviet government, but it has ultimately failed to achieve its wish due to differing opinions between the US and Soviet delegations, resulting in the Korean Provisional Government having no hope of being established soon and remaining in a state of division without gaining independence. The US government believes that this situation cannot be allowed to continue for long, so it now intends to submit the issue of Korean independence to the UN General Assembly for discussion, so that the long-suffering people of Korea can gain freedom and independence as soon as possible. Copies of this note have also been sent to the Chinese and British governments, which are signatories to the Moscow Agreement."</p>
<h3>Two Blocs Engage in Verbal Warfare Over Veto Issue</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 17th] As the United Nations General Assembly is beginning its broad debate, Latin American countries and the Slavic bloc have formed opposition over the veto issue, engaging in verbal warfare, each with its own position. Foreign Minister of Uruguay, Mr. Baudelt, was the first to attack, opposing the veto power of the five major powers. Poland, of the Soviet bloc, immediately retorted, declaring that Poland "firmly opposes any attempt to amend the United Nations Charter, and especially insists on the unanimous vote of the five permanent members of the Security Council." Mr. Baudelt first spoke out, claiming that if the veto power is abused, peace will never be achieved, and the reputation of the United Nations will be greatly damaged. Baudelt continued to appeal to the General Assembly to restore the harmonious atmosphere of the San Francisco Conference, when drafting the UN Charter, when countries and representatives attending the General Assembly placed the common interest above individual self-interest. In addition to opposing the amendment of the Charter, Poland also took the opportunity to criticize the Marshall Plan, attacking the United States for disregarding the United Nations and neglecting the needs of other wartime allies.</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Arrives in New York</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 17th] French Foreign Minister Bidault arrived in New York by plane today to lead the French delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. After disembarking, Bidault said that the mission started in San Francisco should continue, as its great expectations have not yet been realized. Bidault avoided expressing opinions on the veto issue.</p>
<h3>General Assembly Steering Committee Passes Resolution; Greek Issue Included on Agenda; Also Resolves to Establish Special Committee to Handle Holy Land Issue</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, New York, 18th] The United Nations General Assembly Steering Committee, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and Poland, decided last night to place the US proposal recognizing that Greece's political independence and territorial integrity have been threatened on the agenda of this General Assembly session. The Steering Committee also unanimously passed the establishment of a special committee to specifically discuss the Palestine issue. This committee will run parallel to the other major committees of the General Assembly, be composed of all members of the General Assembly, and be directly responsible to the General Assembly.</p>
<p>The Soviet representative stated in the Steering Committee that the proposal by Argentina to convene the General Assembly to amend the Charter and abolish the veto power could not be brought up for discussion. British representative McNeil also stated that he had some clarifications regarding Argentina's proposal to grant Pakistan and India full membership in the United Nations. When discussing the US resolution on the Greek issue, Soviet representative Gromyko strongly opposed placing it on the General Assembly agenda and questioned the US's motives for doing so. He pointed out that discussing this issue in the General Assembly would only further heighten tensions in the Balkans and harm the relationship between Greece and its neighbors. Therefore, the Soviet Union absolutely cannot agree to place this case on the General Assembly agenda. US representative Austin replied that Marshall had explained in detail why the Greek issue must be placed on the General Assembly agenda, and if the Soviet Union opposes it, it can seek the support of a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly to remove it.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun's Speech</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 18th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States and Second Representative to the United Nations, Gu Weijun, delivered a speech today at the Talley celebration of "United Nations Week" in New York, stating that the future of the United Nations will largely depend on its handling of Asian issues. A satisfactory resolution of these issues will further promote world security and peace. Gu cited China's four-year solo resistance against Japan as an example of how the people of Asia believe that truth overcomes power. He stated that this is the spirit of Asia, because "we know that if justice is in crisis, we will never back down and will fight to the end without fear of any sacrifice."</p>

<h3>Bao Dai Issues Declaration; Willing to Negotiate Peace with France</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Saigon, 18th] After a week of negotiations in Hong Kong with Vietnamese representatives sent by Vietnamese Governor Bollaert, King Bao Dai of Annam issued a declaration this morning, announcing his readiness to negotiate peace in Vietnam with France.

<h3>Joint Conference of Two Major International Financial Institutions; Yu Hongjun Honored as Chairman; McCloy to Visit European Countries with Gutt</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 17th] Chinese Finance Minister Yu Hongjun was elected as the chairman of the joint meeting of the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the 17th. At the same time, Washington has been formally selected as the venue for the next General Assembly. The current annual meeting of the two institutions closed today.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] After the conclusion of the annual meeting of the Boards of Governors of the International Bank's President McCloy, and the President of the International Monetary Fund Gutt, will travel to several European capitals to contact government leaders and monetary authorities. McCloy said: The Soviet Union is too far away and is not considered for the trip. One of the purposes of this trip is to find out who has the power to invest and who needs money. McCloy also said that the destinations of this trip may include non-member countries such as the Czech Republic and Switzerland and Sweden. He denied that this trip was related to Marshall's aid to Europe plan. Referring to Britain's economic crisis and the Fund's allocation of 60 million US dollars to Britain to accept pounds, Gutt said that, according to the provisions of the International Monetary Fund's charter, the current so-called dollar shortage is not a phenomenon of dollar shortage listed in the charter, so the Fund cannot find a way to relieve this dollar panic. The Fund's allocation of 60 million US dollars to the United Kingdom is not a loan, but merely a transaction in which pounds are exchanged for US dollars.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Tariff Negotiations; British Side Still Expresses Pessimism</h3>
<p>Clayton to Visit Cripps</p>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 17th] It is reported that US Undersecretary of State Clayton will meet with British Trade Minister Cripps in London to try to break the deadlock in the Anglo-American tariff negotiations. Although various parties have placed some hope on this meeting, people from the British delegation believe that unless the United States can reduce its demands and lower its demands for the imperial trade preference system, the talks will inevitably be fruitless.</p>
<h3>Siam Joins Sterling Area</h3>
<p>[United Press, Bangkok, 18th] Local officials announced that Siam has joined the Sterling Area. The British Foreign Exchange Control Authority will allow the Siam Bank to open correspondent accounts in London, because most of Siam's foreign income is in pounds, so joining the Sterling Area will help its international trade.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Passes Bill; Coal Mine Nationalization Plan</h3>
<p>Government and Three Parties Reach Agreement</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] After the Democratic Party re-submitted an amendment to the issue of coal mine nationalization, a liaison meeting between the government and the three ruling parties was held yesterday. The focus of the meeting was the relationship between the coal mine nationalization bill and the Coal Industry Public Corporation. First, the Socialist and National Cooperative parties expressed their views, hoping that the Democratic Party would abandon its prejudices and separate the two, but the Democratic Party still insisted that the establishment of the Coal Industry Public Corporation was a prerequisite for coal mine nationalization, and the meeting ended without result. After the meeting, the Socialist Party again pushed Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani to negotiate with the Democratic Party, and a final compromise was reached, which was formally passed at today's extraordinary cabinet meeting and will be submitted to the Diet.</p>
<h3>Japanese Liberal and Democratic Parties Join Hands; New Party Movement Takes Shape; National Cooperative Party May Also Participate</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The conservative new party movement is being secretly launched and promoted by a faction centered on Liberal Party Secretary-General Ohno and General Affairs Chairman Hoshijima, and a faction centered on Democratic Party Vice President Tanaka representing the Shidehara faction. The new party is based on the "Anti-Communist Conservative League" organized by some members of the "First Diet Members Club," which is a joint organization of members from the Liberal, Democratic, and National Cooperative parties, and is probing in all directions. Its activities will become more active with the resumption of the Diet. On the 16th, Vice President Tanaka and Secretary-General Ohno exchanged information in the Vice President's office on the progress of the new party's work.</p>
<p>In addition, Honorary President Shidehara and several members of the so-called anti-Yoshida faction have also had sincere talks on the issue of coal mine nationalization and the work of the new party. In addition, the Secretary-General met with them to test Tanaka's true intentions for the new party's work. Tanaka stated: "The great cooperation between the Liberal and Democratic parties in the future is believed to be a destiny, but there are not many who want to split the Democratic Party and immediately join the Liberal Party. If a conservative new party is organized, it should also take unanimous action by the whole party. Therefore, it is necessary for Shidehara and Ashida to maintain close contact." Strict criticism of the coalition government has now arisen within the Democratic Party, and on the coal mine nationalization bill, both the Ashida and Shidehara factions are adopting a tough amending attitude under the premise of the conservative party. Therefore, there is no longer the deep opposition between the two factions as before on issues such as the president and the coalition. The Liberal Party has also temporarily stopped clearing up its past feelings towards the Ashida faction and is seeking a large-scale consolidation of the conservative camp. As for the form of this consolidation, it will try its best to raise the banner of a major reform of the conservative party to seek the support of public opinion. Therefore, if the middle-of-the-road faction centered on "Issuikai" in the Democratic Party can reconcile the opinions within the party, the Liberal and Democratic parties will actively discuss the issue of organizing a new party in late October. In addition, the National Cooperative Party and small parties of the "First Diet Members Club" will also actively participate.</p>
<h3>US Considers Economic Aid to Italy; Italian Prime Minister Personally Mediates Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] US Acting Secretary of State Lovett stated at a press conference that the dollar crisis in France and Italy is more urgent than in the United Kingdom. Before Congress considers the affirmative temporary aid to Europe plan, the State Department is already engaged in extensive research to explore every possible source of supplying dollars to Italy.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 17th] Prime Minister Gasperi today intervened in the strike of one million farm workers in the Po River valley, calling for the resumption of negotiations. Newspapers expect that the labor dispute is likely to be resolved. According to United Press, 850,000 metalworkers, who had been on strike for two days, are reported to resume work tomorrow, pending the outcome of a meeting between the government and labor and management.</p>
<p>[United Press, Rome, 18th] The Italian Communist Party has directly demanded the resignation of the government and the re-entry of the Communist Party into the cabinet.</p>
<h3>US First Secretary of Defense Forrestal Takes Office</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] Secretary of the Navy Forrestal was sworn in as the first Secretary of Defense today, even before President Truman returned to Washington. The President is currently returning from South America on the battleship Missouri. It is said that due to the international situation, Forrestal was ordered to take office first, without having to wait for his return to Washington.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] Forrestal's assumption of office as the first Secretary of Defense is the first step in quickly merging the nation's military departments into a single, powerful national military organization. Legally speaking, the unification of the armed forces will take effect tomorrow. The Air Force will become an independent department, parallel to the Army and Navy departments, but some parts of the plan will not be completed until two years later. The new military organization will have five independent agencies: the National Security Resources Board, the Research and Invention Board, the Munitions Board, the National Security Council, and the Central Intelligence Agency. There will also be a Joint Chiefs of Staff, including the Army Chief of Staff, the Navy Chief of Military Operations, the Air Force Chief of Staff, and the President's Chief of Staff, commanding a joint staff of about one hundred people. The Army, Navy, and Air Force Unification Act was passed by the previous Congress, placing the nation's military departments under the single command of Forrestal to prevent another Pearl Harbor incident from happening again.</p>
<h3>Italians Call for Revision of Peace Treaty</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 17th Broadcast: General Caber, commander of northwestern Italy, today called on Britain and the United States to revise the peace treaty with Italy to increase Italy's military strength to deal with Yugoslavia alone after the Allied forces withdraw. Caber admitted that the Italian army is far inferior to the Yugoslav army in terms of numbers.</p>
<h3>Our Court's First Trial of Chu Li: Why Didn't the Defendant Report the Murder He Witnessed? The Defendant Requested to Be Tried Under Ordinary Criminal Law, Which the Court Did Not Consider</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Englishman Chu Li, also known as Ah Chu, accused of conspiring with U.S. Army Corporal Malay to shoot and kill black market gold broker Yu Shengxiao, has seen Malay sentenced to life imprisonment by a U.S. military court. Chu Li was directly sent by the police department to the local court's criminal division for legal proceedings. The first public hearing of the case was held yesterday at 2 p.m. in the First Criminal Division of the local court. Before the hearing, the court dispatched bailiff squad leader Zhang Ji and Pan Zhupeng to bring Chu Li from the Sinan Road detention center and escort him to the court for questioning. Ah Chu was wearing a white collared mesh shirt, light gray slacks, and old yellow leather shoes. He was burly with a fierce glint in his eyes. At around 2 p.m., Judge Zhu Yuhuang and Prosecutor Ding Tongjun took their seats. Lawyer Zhu Dianhuaiqun from the British Consulate served as the defendant's counsel. Representatives from the British Consulate, Jili, Chen Guolian, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Cha Liangjian, President of the Local Court, and Xu Guoji of the Municipal Police Department, were all in attendance. Chu Li's wife, wearing dark green glasses and a blue floral silk Western suit, sat quietly to one side.</p>
<p>Chu Li was first brought forward for questioning. He stated that he was 33 years old, British, engaged in import and export business, and resided at No. 16, Lane 188, Albert Road, Shanghai. Next, Prosecutor Ding stood up to present the main points of the indictment, roughly stating that on August 1st of this year, Chu Li and U.S. Army Corporal Malay conspired to commit murder by falsely claiming to purchase five gold bars from black market gold broker Yu Shengxiao. Chu Li then drove Yu to a secluded location on the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway and killed him. The investigation by the Jingying Bureau confirmed the evidence of the crime. Based on Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 6 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits and Robbers, and according to Article 3 of the Special Criminal Procedure Law, the case was transferred to the court for trial, requesting that the criminal division punish him according to the law. After the prosecutor finished his statement, Lawyer Tang stood up and said that Chu Li's case was different from banditry and robbery and asked whether it could be handled according to the ordinary criminal law for murder. The court did not consider this request.</p>
<p>Chu Li's testimony mainly stated: He had known Yu Shengxiao for about three months and only knew his surname was Yu. He had traded with Yu about six times.</p>
<p>Malay Asked Him to Purchase Gold Bars</p>
<p>On August 1st, I left my home at 9 a.m., first going to the Hui Zhong Hotel to meet a friend. At 9:45 a.m., I went to the Mars Bar on Nanjing Road, and then to the New Lidu Bar, where I met Malay. The initial conversation was about personal documents. After drinking coffee for ten minutes, Malay asked me if I could find a way to buy five gold bars, each bar weighing ten taels, totaling fifty taels. I agreed to his request and went to discuss it with Yu. Yu said he could arrange it, asking for US$585 per bar. I went to the Li Cha Hotel and told Malay that each bar was worth US$590, with US$5 per bar being my commission. We arranged to deliver the goods at 5 p.m. Malay instructed me to borrow a car, saying that he didn't want a driver. I discussed it with Pai Qu Luofu, stating that the rental fee was 80,000 yuan per hour, and I would drive myself. First, I went to the Li Cha Hotel to pick up Malay. At this time, Malay had taken off his military uniform, changed into civilian clothes, and borrowed a civilian hat from me. When I asked why, Malay replied that buying and selling black market gold in military uniform wouldn't look good. The car drove to Jianmingyuan Road and Renji Road and stopped to pick up Yu. I introduced him, saying, "This is Colonel Malay." The judge asked why he pretended he was a colonel. Chu Li said that he thought saying "colonel" sounded more dignified, it was his own idea and not Malay's instruction.</p>
<p>Saw Yu Covered in Blood</p>
<p>After Yu got into the car, he sat next to Malay in the back seat, with Yu on the left and Malay on the right. Malay immediately ordered him to drive towards Hongqiao Road. According to Malay, they were going to the Country Club, which was around 5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. The car arrived near the Golf Club, when suddenly there was a loud bang, like a tire bursting. When I looked back, Malay ordered me to continue driving. At this time, I only saw Yu staring at Malay with his hands on his chest. When we arrived at the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway, Malay ordered me to stop the car on the right side of the road. At this time, I saw Yu covered in blood, and Malay was holding a towel stained with blood. Yu repeatedly shouted, "Don't kill me. You can take everything. I will definitely not report to the police. Chu Li knows me." Malay opened the car door and dragged Yu out of the car. I asked him, "Why are you doing this?" He replied, "I have to do it." Then he closed the car door and ordered me to turn back. The court asked if Malay had obtained the gold bars at this time. He replied that he simply didn't have time to think. On the way back to Shanghai, he saw Malay throw the blood-stained towel by the side of the road. I and Malay went straight home. I saw Malay find a bullet casing in the car. He went inside and went to the bathroom to wash his hands. He took off his coat and gave it to me to hang up, but it felt quite heavy. He wiped the blood stains from his pants and shirt with a wet towel, then sat down and asked me if I could exchange the gold bars for US dollars. He seemed to need money urgently. I took him to the Xie family on Henry Road, but Xie was not home, so we returned empty-handed.</p>
<p>Reasons for Not Reporting to the Police</p>
<p>At this time, the court sternly questioned! "Since you are pushing all the responsibility for the murder onto Malay, why didn't you report to the police to reduce your responsibility?" Chu Li replied in a relaxed tone: "Yu and Malay were both my friends. I was very unhappy that Yu was killed by Malay and didn't think about reporting to the police." He then stated: After leaving home, I drove Malay to the Race Club. Then I returned the car to Patrick Lof alone, for a total of three hours, for which I paid 290,000 yuan. Then Patrick Lof drove Malay to the Broadway Mansions, and then Patrick drove me home. At 9:10 p.m., I went to the Jinmen Cinema to watch a movie. The next afternoon, Malay came to my house to talk. He asked if there was a way to convert the gold bars into cash and took out a gold bar. The court asked if it was Yu Shengxiao's.

<h3>Rare Large Diamond Once Surprised Experts Who Exclaimed Enthusiastically, Labor Costs Are Unaffordable, Still Not Cut</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the large diamond held in the custody of a certain bank in the city, a reporter continued to inquire with relevant parties and learned that the diamond was not produced in Nanyang, but flowed into Singapore from elsewhere. Because its surface was covered with a layer of milky white mineral matter, which at first glance looked like alum crystals, no one could determine that it was a rare large diamond. It wasn't until after overseas Chinese Li bought the diamond and took it to a famous French geologist for research that the expert, after appraising it, was overjoyed and exclaimed, "I have never seen such a large diamond in my life!" Later, Mr. Li consulted many experts in Hong Kong and Taiwan, who all said that it was indeed a diamond, but the outer layer of mineral matter had to be cut away before it could show its sparkling brilliance. Mr. Li did not use domestic workers due to a lack of good diamond cutters in the country, while the wages for cutting diamonds in the United States would be more than half of the diamond's value, so he postponed the cutting and brought it to Shanghai to be stored in a certain bank. Besides the fact that about 100 carats of rough small pieces were cut off in Hong Kong and sold for 40,000 Hong Kong dollars, Mr. Li cut off two or three small pieces from the protruding parts of the diamond in Shanghai and gifted them to relatives and friends. After these small diamonds were processed and cut, the edges and corners were crystal clear, the luster was gorgeous, and the color was the same as that of high-quality diamonds. Mr. Li is currently employed by a company in Taiwan, and due to economic constraints, sold it for US$1.5 million. It is said that the value of the diamond is actually more than this amount.</p>

<h3>Simple Canteens Need 100 Shi of Rice Per Day, Civil Food Allocation Committee Agrees to Allocate and Sell</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Civil Food Allocation Committee held its sixth meeting at 10 a.m. yesterday, presided over by Director Wu Kaixian, to discuss several important cases:</p>
<p>(1) Simple civil canteens in the city request rice allocation. According to a report submitted by civilian Xi Langqing, the canteen has installed a water-heating boiler and can cook more than 100 shi of rice per day. There are a total of 26 vegetable markets in the city, with 25 branch canteens set up, each using 4 shi of rice per day, totaling 100 shi. Currently, the canteen's rice is purchased from the black market, and each bowl is priced at 500 yuan. If allocated rice at a fair price, the price per bowl will definitely be reduced, which will greatly benefit civilian food. Resolution: The principle is feasible, but the canteen should regularly send staff to supervise and unify the price of rice.</p>
<p>(2) The handling fee for the first phase of poor rice distribution is set at 1,500 yuan per shi. The current report states that it is not enough to cover expenses, and the request is to increase the handling fee starting from the second phase. Resolution: Depending on the actual situation, a discretionary increase will be given in the next phase. (3) The first phase of poor people's rice distribution began on August 8. Most districts did not begin distribution until mid-August. According to the regulations of the Allocation Committee, it should be sold out within ten days, but many districts are still requesting continued sales. However, the Ministry has repeatedly ordered that the period for poor people's rice distribution should be limited to one month. The first phase has been carried out for a full month, so how should the deadline be unified? Resolution: The first phase of poor people's rice distribution will end fifteen days after the last rice delivery unit is allocated grain. (4) The amendment to Articles 6 and 7 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Rice Distribution for Occupational Workers was resolved and retrospectively approved. 10,000 yuan will be added per shi, of which 9,000 yuan will be deducted by the rice sellers to cover transportation, storage, loading and unloading labor, sales losses, and all handling fees. The remaining 1,000 yuan will be used as verification, investigation, and supervision fees for the Allocation Committee. (5) The rice distribution for occupational workers will begin in September, and it is proposed to send personnel to various occupational trade unions and public sales outlets for regular supervision and inspection, such as checking the roster of certificate holders and inspecting the actual sales situation of the rice stores, to ensure thoroughness. The resolution was passed.</p>
<p>The second phase of poor people's rice distribution will be started after the first phase is completed.</p>

<h3>Gasoline Purchases with Certificates: Fraud Discovered; Users Hoarding, Gas Stations Raising Prices; Director Zhao Says He Will Crack Down</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Director of Public Utilities Bureau Zhao Zengjue met with reporters in the Municipal Government meeting room yesterday to report on the fraud discovered since the implementation of gasoline purchases with certificates in the city, and the Public Utilities Bureau's handling methods, stating: (1) Since the implementation of gasoline purchases with certificates in the city, all gas stations have become extremely crowded, and it has been found that the city's gasoline consumption has actually increased compared to before the implementation of gasoline purchases with certificates. The reason is purely the fear of the citizens. Citizens believe that there will inevitably be a gasoline shortage in the city, so they are vying to buy and hoarding at home. The Public Utilities Bureau believes that this phenomenon is extremely unreasonable and easily creates a fire hazard, so it has decided to conduct a strict investigation and crack down. If it is found that users have unreasonable gasoline consumption, their gasoline purchase certificates will be revoked. (2) A small number of gas stations have been found to have fraudulent practices, failing to supply the allocated gasoline as much as possible, and instead selling the gasoline at black market prices for profit. The Public Utilities Bureau has decided to crack down severely. The Asia Gas Station at No. 551 Fuxing Middle Road has already been investigated and ordered to suspend business for one month as punishment. (3) The formulation of the gasoline purchase with certificates method was previously agreed upon by the oil companies. However, after implementation, the oil companies all have complaints. The Public Utilities Bureau has decided to convene the responsible persons of the oil companies tomorrow to review this method again. Finally, Director Zhao hoped that citizens could understand the government's difficulties, cooperate sincerely, supervise each other, and exert their strength.</p>

<h3>Improper Entertainment: Difficult to List Items</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The measures to ban improper entertainment being drafted by the Social Bureau are difficult to implement because it is not easy to list items. A request has been submitted to the Municipal Government for instructions, and the Municipal Administration Meeting this week did not have time to discuss it. The so-called definition of improper entertainment refers to entertainment that is illegal, superstitious, wasteful, and useless, such as gambling, obscenity, instigation to crime, and disturbance of public order. Games of cricket fighting with money gambling, golf games, ring throwing, and hoop games are also prohibited.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Line: Passing White Dew</h3>
<p>[Report from Hangzhou, 16th] This reporter, running along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, asked experienced old farmers, people's representative councilors, agricultural experts, and county officials. They did not dare to be extravagant about this year's autumn harvest.</p>
<p>White Dew Rain: Steals Rice, Ghosts Steal</p>
<p>According to experienced old farmers: "White Dew rain steals rice, ghosts steal (a pun)." After it rains on White Dew Day, insect plagues will occur everywhere. For example, insect plagues have already been discovered in Jiashan and other places. There is also a saying: "White Dew rain, arrives in one place, ruins one place." Don't expect a good harvest in any place that has experienced White Dew rain. Probably during the White Dew season, it is precisely the time when the rice is showing its flowers. Only after the flowers show can it bear fruit. The best weather for flowering is cloudy and sunny. If there is a big sun, the flowers will be forced to die. If it rains, the flowers will be damp and easily change. So rain before and after White Dew is bad, old farmers' experience tells us. But according to some people: "White Dew rain is misty, Autumn Equinox rice is evenly ripe." This means that White Dew rain is not heavy, but misty, which is still beneficial to the rice fields. I also consulted agricultural experts, who said: "White Dew rain is bad, is completely without scientific basis." Let's not care whether the rain on White Dew Day is good or bad, but a kind of terrible experience and legend is widely spread in the countryside. Will the farmers be discouraged by this legend? This is why government personnel must work hard to think of remedial measures. Promote and publicize to the villages to make effective salvage.</p>
<p>Good Autumn Harvest, Good Hundred Industries</p>
<p>At present, except for Shanghai, every city and town along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line can be said to be looking forward to the autumn harvest. If the autumn harvest is good, everything will be possible. Like the bricks and tiles of Jia Li Shan, of course few people in big cities build houses, but after the autumn harvest, some rural villages will add rooms and build houses, and the brick and tile industry can also take the opportunity to prosper. Like Fengjing homespun, Xieshi Western socks, and Chang'an gauze, all are eagerly awaiting the large-scale purchases by the rural villages after the autumn harvest. Even the commerce of every city and town is waiting for the farmers to have a little surplus to exchange for a little goods. We look forward to this year's autumn harvest, and we still have to work hard. We hope that after the autumn harvest, the price of rice will not depreciate too low. Don't wait for the farmers to sell their grain after the autumn harvest, and then hear the shouting of "cheap grain hurts farmers!"</p>
<p>Another problem that exists between the villages along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line is the problem of tenant farmers reclaiming wasteland. I have visited three or four counties, and they are all discussing the issue of tenant farmers reclaiming wasteland. The so-called tenant farmers are the mountain people of Shangba Prefecture in Zhejiang, or the people of the Northern District of Jiangsu. Some of them have the habit of being diligent and hard-working. When reclaiming wasteland, their production capacity is always stronger than that of local farmers, thus arousing an undercurrent of dissatisfaction among local farmers. I believe that the local governments should quickly solve these small problems and should not allow them to continue to exist.</p>
<p>Cultivating Land, Avoid Wasteland</p>
<p>Tenant farmers and domestic farmers are originally people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, they are our own people, and they are also citizens of the Republic of China. We can see that there are still many wastelands existing on both sides of the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line. These wastelands can be announced by the government for reclamation in accordance with the land administration laws and regulations, and quickly improved. If it is still allowed to be barren, tenant farmers may be recruited to reclaim it. What I have investigated is that the conflict between tenant farmers and domestic farmers is not in the reclamation of wasteland, but in the cultivation of cultivated land. There is still a lot of wasteland in southern Jiangsu today, and we should seize the opportunity to "make the best use of the land."</p>
<p>Moving Graves and Coffins, Setting Up Public Cemeteries</p>
<p>To reclaim wasteland, there is another problem, which is the relocation of graves and coffins. I advocate that public cemeteries should be established immediately, and all coffins should be moved to the public cemeteries, so that they are no longer scattered everywhere, making it impossible for reclaimers to start.</p>
<p>From the autumn harvest, I thought of "cheap grain hurts farmers." Because of "cheap grain hurts farmers," I thought of the problem of tenant farming. Tenant farming can increase production. We, the people in power and the representatives of the people, should study this series of problems and truly do something for the people. (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)</p>

<h3>Xianju County Magistrate Huang Xihan Abandons Post: Zhejiang Provincial Government Requests Cancellation of Qualification</h3>

He did not report to the Provincial Government or the Special Commissioner's Office before or after the incident.

<p>[Report from Suzhou, 18th] The Anti-Japanese War Orphans School, "to take in anti-Japanese war orphans who are unable to attend school, provide them with production education and professional training, and cultivate talents for production and construction," located in Suzhou, has been preparing since October last year.

The ceremony was very grand. Zhu Shaoliang, chairman of the school's board of directors, and Yu Bin, vice chairman, traveled from Shanghai to attend. Many reporters from Shanghai newspapers were also invited to Suzhou to participate. Local political parties, military, and education leaders, local gentry, and representatives of orphans' families all participated in the grand ceremony.

<p>The ceremony began with music. The school's principal, Pan Chengyu, presided over the ceremony and said in his speech: Today is the 17th anniversary of the "September 18th Incident." Choosing this day as the opening date to commemorate the martyrs has a very profound meaning. The education work for anti-Japanese war orphans should be made universal and developed into a social movement, hoping for support from all walks of life. Colleagues and students should all remember the difficulties of founding the school, strive for progress, and express heartfelt gratitude to all circles for their assistance in establishing the school. Then, Chairman Zhu Shaoliang reported on the motivation for founding the school.

The amount is very small, and he hopes that the whole country will continue to donate so that the children of orphans can have the opportunity to study. He also encouraged the students to study with peace of mind and inherit the legacy of their predecessors. Vice Chairman Yu Bin then reported on the details of the school's establishment. Mr. Yu promised to help those with talent to develop as much as possible. In the future, he will also raise school funds abroad and set up anti-Japanese war orphans schools all over the country. Then, gentry Fan Junbo, Yao Bingxun, commander of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army, Wang Jiefo, county magistrate, Wang Zhirui, director of the county education bureau, Wang Shujie, secretary of the county party department, and others delivered speeches successively, all expressing their willingness to do their best to assist the school's development. Finally, a female student representative gave a reply on behalf of all the students: "We are a group of orphans. Now we have the opportunity to study and have clothes to wear. We will definitely work hard in the future." Before she finished speaking, she was already sobbing, and the audience was moved by it. Then, the ceremony was completed, photos were taken, and the school buildings were visited. (Reporter He Liping)</p>

<h3>Nathan Flies to Hong Kong, Various Missions</h3>
<p>[Our Hong Kong Dispatch, 16th] Sir Frederick Nathan of the British Ministry of Civil Aviation arrived in Hong Kong on the 15th. On the 19th, he will go to Beijing to discuss issues related to the development of British aviation in the Far East after the signing of the Sino-British Civil Aviation Agreement with relevant Chinese authorities. As Kai Tak Airport, Hong Kong's only airport, is small and surrounded by mountains on three sides, the British authorities have long intended to select another site to open a grand airport suitable for international standards. However, the ideal location within Hong Kong's borders is only in the New Territories, which belongs to China as a leased territory. If it is to be developed as an airport, it seems that China's consent should be obtained first. It is rumored that Sir Nathan's trip to Beijing is related to this matter. Another theory is that the Hong Kong government intends to reclaim land from the sea in the Stonecutters Island area to open a large aviation port.</p>

<h3>Poor Students and Children of Public School Teachers Should Be Exempted from Tuition Fees, Li Ximou Published a Written Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The collection of tuition fees by municipal national schools in the city was previously decided by the mayor convening a meeting of representatives of municipal school teachers and staff, and was approved by the education group of the municipal council. However, some schools have recently failed to comply with the order to exempt poor students and children of public school teachers. Li Ximou, Acting Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, was very angry upon hearing the report, and specially published a written statement yesterday as follows: "The collection of tuition fees by municipal national schools was originally a temporary expedient measure to show consideration for the difficult lives of teachers. Therefore, it is stipulated that children of public school teachers and poor students should be exempted. Of the collected amount, half should be distributed to the teachers and staff of the school first, and the remaining half should be deposited in the Municipal Bank for unified distribution. This method was discussed and decided upon by all the principals, and all schools should strictly abide by it. Recently, a few schools have changed it without authorization, which violates the original intention of equal distribution decided by the principals. If there is the above situation, once the investigation is true, it should be strictly stopped."</p>

<p>[Our Dispatch] There were originally four games in the second volleyball league last night. Due to the temporary withdrawal of the Shuhui team in Group B, three games were played.

<h3>Severe Decline in Early Market, Chinese Stocks Still Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the rollover day for cash and forward transactions in Chinese stocks. The foreign exchange market did indeed announce a tightening, but with no foreign capital coming in and businesses facing increased burdens, the situation only worsened. Over time, a wave of sell-offs emerged. After 11:30 AM, rumors of failed loan applications and instability among firms spread widely, causing the "Hen Mouse" (a term for speculators) ranks to collapse, leading to a very severe decline. However, miscellaneous stocks were not affected and remained relatively stable. In the afternoon, due to excessive declines, despite large-scale buying intervention by national banks, the situation gradually stabilized from fatigue.</p>
<p>The morning opened bullish. After the debut of forward Yung Shing cotton yarn, the foreign exchange rates were announced, and the British and American currencies both experienced a decline, initially boosting morale. Numbers 223 and others bought in, causing a surge in prices. Spot Yung Shing rose from 236 yuan, and forward transactions rose from 243 yuan, jumping to a high of 241 yuan and 250 yuan after the opening. When China Cement debuted, there was a lot of interest in the new stock, and Numbers 35 and others gradually pushed it up to the limit. However, after some selling at high prices, Yung Shing was unable to sustain the momentum and retreated. Many resold spot Yung Shing, and there were even more sellers of forward contracts, with interest rates still opening at 2 jiao 2.5 fen and 2 jiao 7 fen, gradually declining with little resistance. After 11 AM, the market collapsed, with widespread selling. Rumors of failed loan applications and instability among eight firms circulated, and Yung Shing plummeted to a low of 221 yuan and 215 yuan for immediate delivery near noon. Although other stocks were affected, they lacked counterparts, causing prices to stagnate. Many took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and the market closed at 219 yuan and 226 yuan at noon. Asking prices rose slightly after the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, immediate delivery shares of Yung Shing, Sino-British, Mei Ya, Jing Fu, and New China fell by 5%, Hua Feng fell by 10%, New Light, Sino-French, Qin Xing, China Textiles, Rong Feng, and Commercial Press experienced slight declines, while Zhabei, China Silk, Li An Firecrackers, and New Asia remained unchanged, and underwear and Yung Yieh rose slightly. Cement hit the limit. Forward shares of Yung Shing, Sino-British, Mei Ya, and Jing Fu experienced slight declines, New Light rose slightly, and Hua Feng fell by 5%.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, forward Yung Shing rose to 229 yuan and hovered for a long time. As it approached 3 PM, it was learned that the national bank's exchange intervention was still significant, leading to a lot of liquidation of spot and forward Yung Shing, pushing prices down to a low of 217 yuan and 224 yuan. However, there was a slight rebound before the close, ending at 222 yuan and 229 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, immediate delivery shares of Yung Shing, Sino-British, Mei Ya, New Light, Jing Fu, Sino-French, and Li An rose slightly, Qin Xing, underwear, and Rong Feng remained unchanged, Hua Feng rose by 10%, and cement remained at the limit. Firecrackers fell by 5%, and Zhabei and China Silk experienced slight declines. Forward shares of Sino-British rose by 5%, Yung Shing, Hua Feng, and Jing Fu rose slightly, New Light remained unchanged, and Mei Ya experienced a slight decline.

<p>Chung Hing Shipping is scheduled to be listed on Monday, August 22nd, with a temporary trading unit of 50,000 shares. New China Cement is also scheduled to be listed on the same day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rollover spread for cash and forward transactions saw a reduction in funds released by financial institutions. There were occasional instances of reversed interest payments, causing the spread to rise from low to high, with a daily interest rate of approximately 1 jiao to 1 jiao 4 fen, including Yung Shing from 6.9 yuan to 8 yuan, Sino-British from 3.7 yuan to 4.8 yuan, Mei Ya from 10 yuan to 16 yuan, and New Light from 4.5 yuan to 5.5 yuan. Yung Shing continued to end at the highest price of around 7 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Popular, Foreign Stocks Weak</h3>
<p>Government bonds were very popular yesterday. Run De and others bought in, while Rooms 503 and 550 sold, with the transaction volume still around 5 million.

The Hong Kong Shanghai Telephone Company rose in the morning but declined in the afternoon, with an unstable situation. Ewo Yarns opened at 99,500 yuan, but was affected by Chinese stocks and gradually fell to a closing price of 94,500 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, British Union and Cheung Tai fell by 5%, Ewo Brewery rose slightly, the International Savings Society, Fung Yieh, and Guang Ping were unchanged, and the rest experienced slight declines.</p>

Although I have been in this harsh environment for two years, I have continuously communicated and secretly met with him. Now that my lover and I are deeply in love, we have entered into prenuptial agreement, Now there are several points, I beg you to give clear instructions, (1) Is my engagement with the other party, with my mother's consent, legally effective? (2) If my grandparents interfere, what legal argument can I use? (3) The other party already has a wife, and he allows me and his wife to be treated equally (not distinguishing between senior and junior wife, called one family with two branches). I am also willing to do this. Is this legally valid? (4) If someone else introduces me to a husband to my grandparents without seeking my consent, can I refuse? Please give me your blessing. Reader Liu Qingxiu bows and begs, September 8th.</p>
<p>[This column answers] Ms. Liu: According to the Civil Code, marriage agreements should be entered into by the man and woman themselves. However, minors (those under the age of 20 are minors) who enter into marriage agreements should obtain the consent of their legal representatives (parents are the legal representatives of their minor children). You are 18 years old this year and are still a minor. If you enter into a marriage agreement with someone, you should obtain the consent of your parents. As for your grandparents, they have no right to interfere. However, your boyfriend already has a wife, which is a big problem. Although you are willing, the law does not allow it! Article 985 of the Civil Code stipulates: "A person with a spouse shall not remarry." Article 237 of the Criminal Code stipulates: "A person who has a spouse and remarries or marries two or more people at the same time shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than five years, and the person who marries them shall also be punished." Therefore, the wisest approach is to "rein in the horse at the edge of the cliff" and re-select an ideal partner. This concerns lifelong happiness, so you must not mislead yourself!</p>

<h3>Talking about the Japanese on the "September 18th" Incident</h3>
<p>From the "September 18th" Incident, the "January 28th" Incident, the "July 7th" Incident to the "August 13th" Incident, the Japanese have been following a path: invading China, sucking the blood of the Chinese people, making themselves strong, and dominating the Pacific and Asia.</p>
<p>But for sixteen years, this aggressive militaristic dream has not awakened. The Japanese were defeated in battle two years ago. Although they were formally disarmed, the Japanese's inherent spiritual weapons and the skeleton of militarism have not been dismantled!</p>
<p>The "children of the gods" emperor is still preserved. He is the idol of Japanese aggression and the "signal station" for Japan's outward development. Although the emperor has donned civilian clothes, he is the soul of militaristic Japanese people.</p>
<p>Japan's secret police and power institutions have not actually disintegrated. The original personnel and military warlords who have won military exploits are still standing in obscurity, pointing out the direction for the Japanese people to rise again.</p>
<p>Japan's light industry and the economic institutions of the zaibatsu are not only not destroyed, but are also moving forward under the encouragement of making Japan's economy self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Although these responsibilities can be blamed on the American commander, MacArthur, the Allied countries that control Japan should propose strong corrections on this day commemorating the sixteenth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident!</p>
<p>If not, then it is not impossible for the Japanese to launch another "September 18th" Incident in China or the Pacific.</p>
<p>At the very least, its economic aggression has been directed at China two years after its defeat!</p>

<h3>Reflections on the "September 18th" Incident</h3>
<p>— Zhiwei</p>
<p>Today is the sixteenth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident. Since 1928, Japanese imperialism has actively provoked and exerted pressure on our country under various pretexts. Following the "May 3rd" Incident, there were the "Wanbaoshan" Incident and the "Nakamura" Incident, which were considered the fuse of the "September 18th" Incident. After the "September 18th" Incident, there were the "January 28th" War, the "Yuguan" War, the "Rehe" War, the "Great Wall" War, the "Chengdu" and "Beihai" Incidents, and the "Marco Polo Bridge" Incident, which triggered our country's full-scale resistance. After eight years of heroic resistance, our country finally won. Militaristic Japan has already submitted to the banner of justice. In theory, we should be welcoming this great anniversary - an anniversary full of lessons - with the most pleasant emotions. However, in today's environment, we are filled with mixed feelings and endless emotions, and we really don't know where to start.</p>
<p>The speed of Japan's recovery two years after its victory is unparalleled in modern history. Even Germany cannot help but be inferior and lag behind. Today's Japan, not only in the consciousness of the Japanese people, almost no longer recognizes itself as a defeated country. It still blindly worships militarism and the Emperor system. Even the most important turning point in modern history - the scene of the Japanese representatives signing on an American warship - I am afraid it has long been forgotten. The ambition of aggression is trying to rekindle, and I want to relive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."</p>
<p>The peace treaty with Japan has not yet been established, but Japan's private foreign trade has been opened since August 15. And recently, many Class A war criminals in Japan have been unconditionally released on the grounds that "the suspicion of being domain criminals has been temporarily cleared"... In short, MacArthur's treatment of Japan is too tolerant, almost indulgent. It must be known that this tolerant policy will cause immeasurable troubles in the future. Maybe one day, Japan will interrogate the war criminals who dropped the atomic bombs!</p>
<p>The "September 18th" Incident is a bloody lesson in our country's history. It is a national spirit that can never be forgotten, and it has deepened our belief in "the victory of justice." When we look back on the past and face the reality, who can guarantee that the "September 18th" Incident will not be repeated in the future? We must be vigilant, not forget the bloody lesson of the "September 18th" Incident, and remember the parting message of "We'll be back in twenty years."</p>
<h3>Introducing to All Shanghai Students: Shuping Scholarship</h3>
<p>— Ge Le Shan</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Ran's article "Interlude at a School Shop" on July 7th told us many inside stories about scholarships, all of which were sly scams aimed at registration fees. Wang Guangsheng even believes that there is absolutely no great philanthropist in Shanghai who can help as many as three hundred impoverished students. I do not think so, because the Shuping Public Scholarship that I know is beyond Mr. Wang's expectations. Since its establishment, the Shuping Public Scholarship has awarded scholarships to more than a thousand students, and in the next semester, it will continue to help about three hundred and fifty people.</p>
<p>The Shuping Public Scholarship was founded by Mr. Qian Lin in the 28th year of the Republic of China, and it has been a full eight years today. Mr. Gu founded the Shuping Public Scholarship to commemorate his late father, Mr. Gu Shuping, and to help outstanding young people who have been forced to drop out of school.</p>
<p>The Shuping Public Scholarship was originally only for high school students, but now many university students continue to receive scholarship assistance. In addition to tuition and miscellaneous fees, the Shuping Public Scholarship also provides book fees. Students with excellent grades can also receive room and board fees. Any impoverished student can apply. If your grades meet the scholarship standards—an average of 85 points—and you pass the Shuping Public Scholarship eligibility test, you can start receiving the scholarship. After you receive the scholarship, if you do not slack off in your studies, then the scholarship will help you until you graduate from university without any problem.</p>
<p>The Shuping Public Scholarship has many facilities for scholarship recipients, such as a library, free barber shop, laboratory, shorthand class, typing class... and so on, too numerous to mention. For the health of the students, the Shuping Public Scholarship also employs excellent doctors to provide free treatment for various diseases.</p>
<p>(The author is one of the scholarship recipients of the Shuping Public Scholarship, so he is quite familiar with the inside story of the Shuping Scholarship. Everything mentioned above is factual.)</p>

<h3>The First Troops to Resist During the September 18th Incident</h3>
<p>— Mei Wu</p>
<p>During the September 18th Incident, the first to encounter and resist the Japanese army was the 7th Brigade of the Northeastern Army, which had three regiments, 619, 620, and 621, stationed in Beida Camp. The Japanese attacking forces were divided into three main detachments. The second detachment attacked Dongda Camp, the third detachment attacked the provincial capital, and the first detachment with the strongest firepower attacked Beida Camp, because Beida Camp was the largest barracks in the Northeast at the time, and the enemy was quite afraid of it.</p>
<p>The Japanese army advanced in five lines, with infantry leading the way and heavy artillery providing cover from behind. Machine gun bullets fired like popping beans. The longest line first invaded the northeast corner, and the 621st Regiment was caught off guard and fought in haste, suffering heavy losses. Soon, the Japanese army invaded from the southwest corner, and the 7th Brigade headquarters and the 619th Regiment could not withstand the fierce firepower of the Japanese army and had to withdraw from the camp. The remaining troops retreated one after another.</p>
<p>At this time, the Japanese army had encircled about 40% of the camp, while the 620th Regiment was still in the camp, so they fought a bloody battle to break through, and did not completely withdraw until the morning of the 19th. In this small-scale battle, the 620th Regiment suffered extremely high casualties, and the Japanese army also suffered the heaviest casualties.</p>
<p>After the fall of Beida Camp, Dongda Camp was isolated and helpless. The soldiers retreated in formation, crying bitterly, which shows the state of mind of the soldiers at that time.</p>
<p>Marginal Notes on Water Margin</p>
<h3>Piercing Rot</h3>
<p>— Ai Zhu</p>
<p>In the Water Margin, several people were punished by being tattooed and exiled to a certain prefecture's prison. "Tattooing" means tattooing the face, and "exiling" means exiling the body. In ancient times, tattooing the face was called "Qing," which meant leaving an indelible mark on the face of a criminal and then forcing him to do hard labor. From the Qin and Han Dynasties to the Three Kingdoms, all government-owned slaves had marks tattooed on their faces, but it seems that this practice was not very common afterward. In the Song Dynasty, the practice of tattooing and exile was more due to "exile" than "tattooing." At that time, tattooing the face was a mark of soldiers, regardless of whether the soldier was a volunteer, conscript, or drafted man, or a criminal prisoner, they were all tattooed with a few characters. The reason why Song Jiang, Lin Chong, Wu Song, and others were tattooed was simply because they were "exiled" to the "military."</p>
<p>This practice began in the late Tang Dynasty, and the armies of Zhu Quanzhong and Liu Shouguang were like this. The reason was naturally to prevent soldiers from deserting. From then until the Song Dynasty, this practice was continued without being abolished, lasting for three hundred years. Therefore, once someone became a soldier, they could never change careers and were subjected to the contempt and humiliation of the world. It was impossible to tell whether a soldier was a criminal or not, as if all soldiers had committed crimes. During the reign of Emperor Renzong of Song, in order to defend against the Western Xia, the army was not enough, so many conscripts were temporarily recruited from the border areas to form a "righteous army." At that time, it was stated that only hands would be tattooed, not faces. However, the famous virtuous minister Han Qi still strongly advocated that faces must be tattooed, while Fan Zhongyan strongly opposed it. As a result, the conscripts under Han Qi's command had their faces tattooed, while those under Fan Zhongyan's command were spared.</p>
<p>"Heroes don't care about humble origins." Among the tattooed soldiers, there were actually people who relied on their swords and spears on the border to climb to the position of executive, and that was the famous Di Qing. The Song Dynasty originally valued literature and despised military affairs, and among the military men, those who came from the ranks had no hope of making a fortune. Di Qing's success was really an exception at the time. It is said that when he returned to the court after victory, he was rewarded for his merits, and the prime ministers discussed only adding the honorary title of Jiedushi to him. Later, the emperor couldn't stand it anymore and interceded for him, scolding the prime ministers, and then they discussed making him a privy councillor with a tattooed face, which was unprecedented. Even though he became a high official, people still looked down on him. Once, when he and Han Qi led troops on an expedition together, a general offended Han Qi, and Han Qi wanted to kill him. Di Qing stepped forward to protect him, saying that this general was a good man. Han Qi immediately put on a stern face and said, "Only the number one scholar who comes out of Donghua Gate is a good man, what is he!" Han Qi looked down on this unlucky general, and also looked down on Di Qing. Di Qing came out and sighed: "My official position is the same as Han Gong, but I only lack a Jinshi." In fact, although Di Qing suffered from the tattooing, he was a little proud of it in his heart. At that time, there was a maternal uncle of the emperor who was also from the military, with characters tattooed on his face. Later, his sister entered the palace and gained favor, and he also became a high official out of nowhere—this kind of nepotism is naturally another matter, but Di Qing only relied on military merits, so it was an exception. This maternal uncle of the emperor tried every means to find a doctor to remove the characters on his face, and it is said that it was quite effective. He was fat and white, and when the tattoo was removed, he actually had the appearance of wealth and nobility. Someone advised Di Qing to try to find a doctor, but Di Qing said: "I want my brothers to know that tattooing can also lead to success, and I don't want to remove it." When he reviewed the troops, he sometimes pointed to his face and said to the soldiers: "Look at me! As long as you fight bravely, you don't have to worry about not being rich!" It is also said that he always wore a mask on his face when fighting, and I think this may be related to the tattooing, he didn't want the enemy to know his origin.</p>
<p>When Di Qing was a privy councillor, people made a nursery rhyme to slander him, saying: "The Han looks like a barbarian, and the barbarian looks like a Han, his home is by the river of herbs," the first sentence alludes to the character "Di," and the second sentence alludes to his place of origin and the character "Qing," as a prophecy of his rebellion. Another time, a fire broke out across the street, and someone reported that they had seen Di Qing wearing a yellow jacket directing the fire fighting. The yellow jacket naturally alludes to putting on the imperial robe, and directing the fire fighting also implies that he wanted to take the opportunity to start an incident. As a result, he suffered attacks from all sides and was released to a foreign post and left Beijing. Soon, he became ill from anger and did not seek medical treatment or take medicine, and died depressed.</p>

<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>American Housewives</p>
<p>Both are housewives, both cook, wash clothes, sweep the floor, and buy groceries. Chinese housewives are busy all day and night, and they have to take care of their husbands in the evening. They say they don't have time to watch movies, and they don't even have a moment to sit down. American housewives do the same work, but they have a lot of free time all day long. In the evening, they take their husbands' arms and go to the movies or nightclubs for fun. In that kind of living environment, how can they not be broad-minded and fat? You rarely see an American housewife with a worried look. But Chinese housewives are overwhelmed by the heavy burden of the family. Except for a very few wealthy young wives who watch movies, play mahjong, and have fun every night, ninety-nine percent are suffering unspeakable hardships. This kind of suffering is completely unjustified. If Chinese families were mechanized, there would be no hardship to eat. The housewife would get up in the morning, push the electric sweeper, and walk around the room. In one minute, the floor would be swept clean. She would take out milk and bread from the refrigerator, turn on the electric stove, set the timer, and at a certain time, the power would automatically turn off. The bread would be baked and the milk would be boiled. After eating breakfast, she would go to the street to buy groceries. She would walk into the grocery store and take all kinds of vegetables and grains. The prices are fixed, and there is no need to bargain, nor do you need to bring a scale to weigh them. American scales have been standardized. There is no distinction between market scales and old scales, nor is there any difference between lowering or raising the price. The shop assistants are not allowed to press their hands on the scale to increase the weight and deceive customers. This saves a lot of trouble and disputes. Cooking lunch takes more time, but most families eat sandwiches. At most, they open a can. Washing clothes is the cheapest. Put the clothes and soap powder in the washing machine, turn on the power, and the machine will rattle. In about a quarter of an hour, the clothes and sheets will be completely washed and cleaned. Unfortunately, there is still no automatic ironing machine, and manual labor is still required. That is a more troublesome job, which American housewives regard as a daunting task, and most of them do it with the help of their husbands. The rest of the time is free. They read novels, listen to the radio, go for a walk in the evening, watch movies, and those who are interested go to nightclubs. With a glass in hand, they have no worries. American families make full use of Sundays and do not easily let them go. They either go to the suburban parks for picnics, or visit scenic spots in neighboring counties, or attend parties and be sure to have fun before returning. Americans are naturally optimistic and regard everything as unimportant, because Americans are not afraid of losing their jobs and do not worry about firewood and rice. What else can make them worry? The family is the cell of society. When society is stable, the family is also harmonious. In the United States, it is not easy to see husbands and wives scolding and fighting. Fighting can be a reason for divorce. Laying hands is not considered to be a Man. (Here it means a manly man.) (52)</p>
