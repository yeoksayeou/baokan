<h3>煙台收復膠東底定　皖西國軍進駐潛山　顧祝同自鄭抵徐州坐鎮</h3>
<p>〔本報青島一日電〕國軍一日晨九時半正式收復烟台，華北共匪自大速海道接濟路綫遂吿斷絕，而共匪整個戰略乃全盤失敗。另膠東匪軍重要基地鋸齒牙山，亦經收復，刻正掃蕩殘餘散匪中。收復烟台消息係空軍偵察後首先報吿者。空軍目擊國軍源源開入烟台市，軍方隨即發報消息稱：我「闕漢騫部（五十四軍）在强大海空軍掩護下，昨（卅日）晨向烟台總攻撃，經一整夜之激戰，摧毀匪之一切抵抗，於今晨九時半將烟台完全收復，戰果正淸査中　。」</p>
<p>烟台收復，匪軍第六·第十三兩縱隊擬突園西竄，被國軍包圍於膠河漢河中間地區，正激戰中。海陽方面亦有匪軍萬餘人西竄靈山以北地區，兩路殘匪顯圖越過國軍後方，進入魯南山地，連日在陸空軍分別圍殲及尾撃中。</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕蔣主席會令向烟合推進之國軍各部隊，於收復烟台後，應特別加意保護該地之敎會及敎會人士。</p>
<p>（國防部新聞局長鄧文儀報吿收復烟台意義，及其他軍訊，刋第二版）</p>
<p>〔本報漢口一日電〕國九月廿九日克復皖西之潛山城，殘匪向西北吼嶺一帶潰退。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州一日電〕陳毅四個縱隊殘部二三萬人，匪一部於三十日由夾溝李家莊竄津浦路東。又三十日午猛犯宿縣車站及符離　車站之匪，被國軍分別撃退。又三十日夜竄蕭縣永城邉境之匪七千餘，國軍正兜剿中。顧祝同三十日由鄭飛徐坐鎮。</p>
<p>〔中央社開封一日電〕睢縣縣長田中界，於今日上午十時率隊撃退共匪，完全克復縣城。</p>
<h3>王寵惠談中蘇關係　雙方不妨先行交換意見　對日管制應予澈底執行</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕府委王寵惠昨談稱：「關於最近之中蘇關係，政府時時有改善兩國邦交之願望，問題在需要一套辦法，個人主張中蘇間應各派大員，就兩國間之全盤問題，作相當時期之交換意見，開誠磋商，以探討問題之眞正癥結所在。此事不妨由我國先向對方提出，以表示我方之誠意，至於是否有結果，則爲另一問題。中蘇邦交如能改善，對於內部問題之解決，有相當裨益。」按王氏昨日曾與來滬之外次葉公超晤談，就對日和約問題，廣泛交換意見。王氏認爲管制日本之時期應相當長，至少二十年，須俟和約中之每一條款均澈底執行及其國民思想澈底改變之後，方能結束盟國之對日管制。而在管制過程中，我國如派遣少量之軍隊駐日，亦無不可。</p>
<h3>美參衆兩院議員　中止作遠東訪問　數議員擬以私人資格考察遠東</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓卅日電〕參院軍事委員會今日宣稱：該會與參·衆兩院其他委員會委員現在歐洲考察，原定前赴中國·日本·朝鮮及菲律賓等地作五星期之訪問，現已取消。但一部份委員對於實地調査遠東局勢頗感興趣，今後數週仍擬以私人資格訪問上述各地，可能包括太平洋各島在內，然後取道回國。其中計有民主黨參議員哈契·巴克萊·葛林，共和黨參議員楊格·戈登及共和黨衆議員裘特，其餘衆議員數人尙未決定行止。彼等將於十月一日在開羅集中，乘民用機飛往馬尼刺，再乘美軍用機至遠東各地。</p>
<h3>港督抵京　今晋謁主席</h3>

<h3>我將派專機飛港　迎英訪華團來京</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕英國會訪華團代表六人已自倫敦啓程東來，我政府已準備派專機赴港迎接彼等來京。</p>
<h3>港官員論走私　謂我方應負責</h3>
<p>〔合衆社香港一日電〕據香港政府進出口監督席姆斯華斯發表意見稱：香港與中國內地間之走私，主要由於中國官員之默許及中國政府建立之高度貿易壁壘，使消費者所需求，而在中國境內亦有其合法市塲之貨物，加以禁止所致。（席氏演說見第二版）</p>
<h3>最近物價　波動原因　普遍物價刺激糧價</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕關係方面消息，此次京·滬物價波動，起自八月下旬，最初紗布發生波動，香烟·燃料亦呈猛漲，上海米價在八月廿七日以前上白粳迄穩於四十萬元上下，自廿八日以後，始因產地（無錫）價高，隨之上漲，此可證明普遍物價刺激糧價，並非糧價領導物價，自入九月以後，更因共匪西竄，皖·鄂局勢緊張，米糧下運欠暢，漲風轉熾。以九月間全國物價而言，紗布等幾各地普遍猛漲，米價則除京·滬一帶生波動外，長江中上游及東南各省，以新貨滿見或外運困難，反多下跌，華北及東北各省，亦無波動。各種物價已失平衡，京·滬米價因新米登塲，將大量湧到，近產地價格報跌，可有逐漸穩定。</p>
<h3>立院咨文政院　對和約事盼保持聯繫</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕立院近曾就草擬對日和約事咨文政院，請遵國府電令，以後有關對日和約事，應經常與立院保持聯繫。</p>
<p>〔本市訊〕外次長葉公超，偕遠東司長黃正銘，來滬邀集各有關方面舉行座談會，聽取對日和約意見畢，昨晚返京。</p>
<h3>工程師學會年會　今在京行開幕禮　蔣主席頒訓詞將在會中宣讀</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕中國工程師學會第十四屆年會，曁各專門工程學會聯合年會，定二日上午九時揭幕，屆時由大會會長會養甫親自主持，並宣讀主席訓詞。據悉：政院張院長及各部會首長，均將蒞會參加。下午會務報吿，由津·穗·桂·京四分會代表報吿復員以來各該地區建設與破　淸形，晚工程演講改由閻振興講黃河堵口工程。大會籌備處迄一日下午爲止，已收論文七十八件，提案八十七件，各地分會代表已到達首都者，已有滬·蘭·瀋·穗·幷·靑·武漢等七分會，塘沽會員爲報吿新港工程狀况，特派談爾益出席大會，至會員註册報到，」二日晨仍繼續辦理，已報到之總人數已逾一千人。（北平區工程展覽消息刋二版）</p>
<h3>王外長訪晤美總統　討論我目前局勢　對貸欵及魏使調查經過則未談及　與馬卿談判內容守秘密</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓卅日合衆電〕中國外長王世杰，本日偕顧維鈞大使赴白宮作禮節上之訪問後，吿記者謂：渠曾就便與杜魯門總統討論世界及中國局勢。渠曾以中國目前情勢吿杜魯門總統，且發現杜氏對於中國情勢業已十分熟悉，彼等並未討論對華貸款事宜及魏德邁將軍此次考察中韓局勢之經過。王氏證實，渠曾請求與杜氏會談，會談時，助理國務卿阿　爾及遠東問題專家等咸在座，渠並稱：其將繼續在美逗留十天，較其原擬逗留之時間爲長，蓋聯合國可能討論與中國有關之事項也。王氏後曾會晤參議院外交委員會委員康納利，中國大使館定一日舉行宴會，招待美國政府首腦人物。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓卅日電〕中國外長王世杰博士稱：此次在聯合國大會中，曾與馬歇爾國務卿晤談，目前此項談判仍未完成。王氏拒絕透露談判內容。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓卅日電〕負責人士稱：「依目前種種微象觀之，魏德邁報吿書不致公布」。魏氏調査中·韓兩國結果向杜魯門總統所提出之報吿書，現嚴守秘密，截至目前爲止，僅有白宮及國務部最高當局知之，雙方對此均守口如瓶。</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓卅日電〕國務院發言人本日稱：中國方面消息，謂美國擬代國府訓練軍隊十師一節，渠並無所知。渠稱：渠曾向陸軍部叩詢此事，彼等亦毫無所知。</p>
<h3>汽煤柴油進口　從價徵稅百分之五十</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕財部發言人稱：汽油柴油在進口稅則內，本屬有稅貨品，抗戰期間海口淪陷，　緬路封鎖，油料來源阻滯，政府爲鼓勵商民搶運，以應當時需要，決定自廿九年八月起，暫免汽油柴油進口稅，復員以來，洋貨進口多已恢復廿三年進口稅則從價徵稅，而汽油柴油因沿用戰時措施，並未同時恢復徵稅，政府現力謀平衡預算，節約消費，自應對汽油·柴油恢復應徵之關稅，以裕庫收。又前因汽油無稅關係，一般　知牟利，不顧安全之零售商，以稅之汽油滲入煤油以內出售，或則利用無稅之柴油蒸溜獲取煤油，取巧偸稅，凡此種種，亦有予以糾正之必要。政府有鑒於此，最近國務會議業經議決，汽油·煤油·柴油之進口稅，一律增為從價百分之五十，原油暫免徵收進口稅。財部於九月卅日奉到院令後，即日電筯海關總稅務司遵照實行，本年汽油·煤油·柴油進口限額不減少，則以本年十·十一·十二，三個月估計，可能增收之關稅約在二千億元以上（燃料用油進口稅從價加五成實施辦法，見七版）</p>
<h3>張君勱晉京</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社當主席張君勱，昨夜搭車晋京，與有關方面洽商大選問題，因大選之提名及比例之談判，迄今未獲結果。</p>
<h3>董顯光向報界宣布　民盟盟員參加叛亂　總部未能糾正應負責任</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕外傳民盟盟員如閻寳航等担任共匪重要工作，是否確實，可以詳吿否？此一詢問，經董顯光局長於一日下午記者招待會中答稱：民盟份子在共匪盤踞之東北地區，現任重要職務者，有僞遼北省主席閻寳航，僞嫩江省主席于毅夫，副主席車向忱，僞松江省敎育廳長韓幽桐，僞嫩江省敎育廳長關夢覺以及偽東北各省市行政聯合辦事處行政委員高祟民，周鯨文等。以上所舉數人，僅係少數顯著例子，民盟早有共區總支部籌委會之設置，其盟員担任共區工作者，當不限於此數。</p>
<p>閻寳航等以民盟共區總支部籌委身份，接受偽命，背叛政府，此為不可否認之事實。民盟總部對此參加叛亂之盟員，未聞有何表示，惟為貫澈其反政府與反憲法主張，曾對於參加中央政府或國民大會之盟員，則嚴厲對付，迭使退盟。換言之，民盟盟員雖無參加制憲或接受中央任命之自由，但可勾結共黨，擔任匪區要職，參加背叛政府之行動。在此强烈比照之下，負責民盟活動之指導者，在政府與共匪之間，所擇取之地位如何，殊屬明顯。</p>
<p>另一事實，亦値吾人之注意。政府頒布動員戡亂，於完成憲政實施綱要後，民盟份子，在各地從事煽動破壊動員，例如香港民盟港九總支部，於七月間發表宣言，號召以行動對抗總動員，希圖阻得政府徵雇徵購設施之推行是項言論，煽動叛亂，違反法令，以民盟地方總支部名義發表，時隔兩月有餘，負責民盟活動之指導者，從未予以糾正。</p>
<p>任何政當活動，無不以其中央機構所　訂綱要爲依據，民盟港九總支部及其共匪總支部各籌委，皆有參加或煽動叛亂之明顯事實，民盟首腦部在指導方面，自應有其應負之責任</p>
<p>過去民盟與共匪間關係密切，主張一致。此爲社會共見之事實，無須贅述。政府頒布總動員令後，若干民盟盟員仍不知自愛，公然擔任匪區工作，參加叛亂，其海外總支部，復盡量宣傳，號召人民，以行動反抗政府，凡此事實，益足使人深信民盟殊非獨立政黨，實爲中共之附庸。</p>
<p>羅隆基申辯</p>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕民盟發言人羅隆基，一日夜十一時爲董顯光一日於記者會上涉及民盟問題，特發表談話、予以申辯。渠否認閻寳航爲民盟盟員及周鯨文參加共匪工作，惟羅對「民盟盟員有在共區祖任職務者」承認「確爲事實」，惟辯稱：「均爲地方職務，且就職於一年以前，非戡亂命令發表後之事」。渠對董氏所指摘民盟言論煽動叛亂事，亦提出反駁，並謂政府發言人此際「攻擊」民盟，命意何在，不得而知。渠談話之結論重申民盟不參加任何一方足以增強國家分裂行動之立塲。</p>
<h3>調整公務員待遇　董顯光稱當局正考慮中　平津公敎人員九月份起配售實物</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京一日電〕政院新聞局長董顯光，一日在記者招待會中，答覆詢問如下：　公務員待遇照以前規定，每三個月應調整一次，最近調整係在八月，則下次調整當在十一月實行。最近檢察院等機關關心公務員生活，所提之調整辦法，正由主管當局詳加考慮中。　美金官價匯率並不提高，黑市價格非余所知。</p>
<p>〔又電〕經濟部近奉行政院令，自九月份起辦理平津兩地公敎人員之實物配售，惟須視物資產量情形如何，始可決定推行步驟。</p>

<p>工程乃產業革命後之實用科學技術，工程師乃應用科學技術的專門人才。工程師聯合組織學會，據記載所及，始於一八二八年英國之民用工程學會。我國工程師聯合組織學會，導始於民元之中華工程師學會，及中華工學會，路工同人共濟會，原始創立人爲工程界先進詹天佑氏。其後三工程師團體，爲集中力量，發展工程事業，實行合併，命名「中國工程師學會」，擬定會章卅條，並以　規定營造制度，　發展工程事業，　力闡工程學術爲宗旨。首屆集會，公推詹天佑爲會長，顏德慶徐文炯爲副會長。民廿年南京年會，決議以我國最初組織工程團體之元年爲該會創始之年，此所以表徵我國立國之年，卽爲我國工程事業萌芽建立之年。事實上，民國三十年以來，我國工程事業之設施，工程建設之開展，我國工程師貢獻甚多·工程師學會之組織，不啻爲我國工業建設之原動力。尤其在抗戰期間，我國工程界人才輩出，對國家，對人民，俱有至大之貢獻。已故工程師，如詹天佑，李儀祉，范旭東，張莘夫等，致力於工程事業，莫不鞠躬盡瘁：現在工程人員，又莫不固守崗位，脚踏實地，踔厲風發。這都是可作一般國人的模範。</p>
<p>中國需要現代化，工程事業與工程建設，實有燦爛的遠景。爲了科學技術的實用，爲了迎頭趕上新世紀，在當前，工程學術之吸收與研究，工程人才之培養與運用，尙有待各個工程技術團體之努力奮發。學術團體，本爲匯集人才，深入研究，致知力行的結合體，它的發展，它的前途，不在年會的形式，應在年會的意志交換後，集中統一的力量於本位事業的開展。中國工程師學會，組織嚴密，人才衆多，有信條，有紀律，當國家憂患未定的今天，一切工程事業之設施，工程建設之設計，均有賴於工程人員，精益求精，作百尺竿頭更進一步的努力。</p>
<p>五千年間我國民族的建國大計，前有禹貢，後有國父的實業計劃，一部禹貢，曾經奠定我國過去五千年之國家，猶之一部實業計劃將以建設未來五千年來之國家，我們的國家，由於祖先的艱苦締造，有根有基，沃土有待建築，莽原有待開　。而實業計劃則已設計了圖樣，氣宇雄偉，有經有緯，指示出工程人員的路徑，今而後，如何循此理想，實踐創進，這便是我國工程師的遠大任務。工程師學會三十年度年會，修正之信條首條曰：「遵從國家之國防經濟建設政策，實現國父之實業計劃」，次條曰：「認識國家民族之利益高於一切，願犧牲自由，貢獻能力」，其精神，其抱負，何等壯偉！工程師是重實踐的，遵守規律的，看六年來的世界潮流，國家的情勢，我國工程師的任務，確很遠大。希望工程人員立定志向，認識國家民族之利益，在政府國防經濟政策之下，貢獻學術與技能，爲實現國父實業計劃理想而作堅苦卓絕的奮鬥。</p>
<p>中國工程師學會，三十年來有光明燦爛的歷史，未來的遠景更偉大，更久長。我們願此屆年會的召開，光大學會的精神，發揚學會的信條，認識自身責任重大，奮發有爲，與政府人民的步調一致，共創富强康樂的新中國。</p>
<h3>收復烟台意義　甚於延安之役　鄧文儀對記者報告</h3>
<p>〔本報南京一日電〕膠東國軍一日晨收復烟台消息傳來後，此間人士極感興奮，咸認山東半島共匪肅淸已不成問題。國防部新聞局局長鄧文儀，一日下午四時半出席新聞局之記者招待會，報告軍事時，尤强調國軍收復烟台之重大意義。渠稱：膠東國軍係九月十五日起開始進攻，分由即墨，膠縣，高密三路出動，迄今半月，即已將烟台收復。鄧氏繼指出膠東之戰略價値，謂：國軍收復張垣後，東北共匪與山東之交通惟恃膠東之烟台，山東壯丁糧食，東北武器彈藥，均假此孔道輸送；該地經國軍收復，可決定今後共匪之失敗命運，其打擊將較延安一役爲甚。是役說明共軍以竄渡黃河，進擾皖鄂，威脅武漢京滬，企圖牽製膠東戰路已吿失敗，對其士氣之打擊尤大，而共軍實行之「空心戰術」，抽調冀晋軍兵約達百分之八十南竄，致使其腹地兵力空虛。收復膠東之國軍，祇須以半數即可收復河北匪區，進而規復山西，增援東北，收復東北領土主權。鄧氏之結論稱：烟台之役，爲共匪全盤戰路之失敗，亦即爲抗戰結束以來國家統一建设致命危機之消除。</p>

<h3>港政府進出口監督　席姆斯華斯演說詞　暴露走私方法及路綫</h3>

<h3>海海鹽之旅</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州九月二十九日訊〕過　山，越過杭州而到去海寗的路上，這是接近</p>
<p>海塘的邊緣</p>
<p>記者曾經到過好多次，也曾翻車受傷過，奇怪的是這一次的道路是這樣的平坦，同行的司機也說這是戰後最好的路了。到海寗城邊，特地到海寗的觀潮亭去巡邏一番，見石塘外面，一片黃沙，當年萬馬奔騰的海潮壯觀，確不能再在海寗城外得見了。我還想起了不忍再見的海寗城裏的荒凉景象，但田先生一定要我陪他去看一次，一到城裏，依舊是斷垣殘壁，海寗的縣府，不知到底作何打算，省府，專署一再命令還治，而至今還絲亳沒有跡象。再從</p>
<p>海寗到海鹽</p>
<p>沿途，工和師們不斷的下車，問道班，看橋樑，眞是忙個不了，聽說道班的每一工人每月薪津僅二十四萬元，伙食先要吃二十萬元，這些道班多牛因着抽丁關係而來此避役的，有些人甚至還從家裏帶了錢來。我們行至中途，天忽降雨，工程師們　冒雨工作，他們爲了旅客的安全，問這問那，眞够令人感動　車滑過海　，路稍稍顛簸一些，徐匯濬兄吿訴記者，這一節路還須整理。一路上瞭望右側的海，又看見海濱的鹽田，田先生是初次來這裹，很感興趣。當晚，我們留宿在乍浦的海風旅館，這是打游擊著名於江南的</p>
<p>雙槍王八妹</p>
<p>女士所開，聽說王女士還在黃山設有旅館。田先生詩興勃發，吟了好多的詩詞。翌　，記者和田先生去街上走走，這麥差不多都是鹹　店，還有新鮮的海蜇賣，我們走到海邊，見那頭尾高撓的海船，沒有邊際的海，呼呼的唱着歌，一般濃重的海洋氣息使我們生長在平原農村上的孩子們感到愉快。</p>
<p>我們走到乍浦鎭盡頭，看見一個</p>
<p>破了的砲壘</p>
<p>再往前邊去看時，很像到了直戰塲，那被毀了的大石板，東倒西歪，這個砲壘有三尊砲，正對著海面，而兩尊鐵砲已沒有了砲架，身體上發生了濃厚的銹，一尊砲較爲完好，但也鐵銹得很厲害，砲沒有後面的輸彈道，恐怕砲彈要從口內放進是的，也沒有瞄準器，這三尊砲去逕淸光緒甲申年江南製造廠的出品。我們覺得這種東西在國外是要保存得好好的了。但我們却忍令廢棄，眞太可惜。我們又遙望幾個山巒上，都有砲台與軍用工事，不過如果也像這個砲壘一樣的廢棄着，那還有什麽話好說呢？</p>
<p>乍浦與澉浦</p>
<p>之間，眞可以說是最好的港灣，那一片廣大的海水眞是令人喜愛。接着我們又上黃山去，這裏在夏天也是避暑勝地，很多外國人都紛紛來此。據說當時公路上的小汽車簡直啣尾接踪，可想見其盛况之一斑。山上多牛是簡單的房屋，設備也不頂好，山脚下有一片河，河上搭一些草棚，據說這是簡單的海水浴塲，草棚是更衣的地方。面着黃山有三座小島，靠左的一座樹木葱　，大可把黃山與這三座小島建設一番，倒能吸引不少遊客。</p>
<p>我們再驟車前進，那是一段尙在興工的公路，機械在不休息的動着，直到金絲娘　，梁局長田先生他們要到上海去，就讓記者和徐處長回杭州。臨行，他們都吿訴記者，九月底前，也即是看潮的時節，這條路可以安全通車。</p>
<p>杭州灣，風物富麗，確是値得建設的地方。現在錢塘江海塘工理局要使杭州灣通航，這已使建設杭州灣的理想推進了一步。（特派員儲裕生）</p>
<h3>香港的人名事件　噱頭攤戶竟取名王雲五大胆神女跟法官開玩笑</h3>
<p>〔本報香港廿八日航訊〕有個靑年人，拿起一瓶硝酸向一個導游女迎臉潑去，結果被提進官裏去，法官詰問他的姓名，他答說：「張玉祥！」灣仔史刁城道有個小攤頭，豎起一塊白布黑字，寫着：「王雲五剷剃刀磨較剪」。</p>
<p>香港人不知是為了好奇，還是為了凑趣，近來紛紛「盜用」了國內名流的姓名。一些被警察逮捕以「阻街」罪名受罰的神女，她們更明目張胆和法官開玩笑。有一個神女在牛個月內被捕了三次，她首次自稱「冤枉霞」，第二次自稱「墮落霞」第三次自稱「折　霞」，譯員照樣翻成英文，法官照樣聽記，結果竟給這個大胆的神女騙過了！但是事情並非個個都是如此糊塗。</p>

<h3>建築專款六億　撥南昌市府　指定爲交通敎育等用途</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌九月廿六日訊〕中央核發江西本年度建築專款六億元，省府王陵基主席現以該批款項，如轉配各縣，所得甚微，於事無補，乃決定集巾使用，撥交南昌市政府以爲建設南昌示範市之建築專款，並指定爲交通，敎育與公共衛生之用。市府現擬將該款以二億爲修難象山，　山等五幹綫馬路經費，二億為修建市區小學之用，另以二億為修築全市主要下水道與公共厕所，惟聞中央所撥之款，須自本月份起至明年九月份，分期撥發云。</p>

<h3>廣州禁舞　執行上絕無問題對稅收不生影響　厲行節約要從飲食着手</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿七日航訊〕禁舞在廣州，沒有很大的反響。這裏舞場有十多家，舞女與職工總有一兩千人，而社會局的表示：本市禁舞決定由十月一日起實施，如未奉到由央頒布之辦法，亦決先自行草擬臨時實施的單行法，務求從十月一日起，營業性跳舞全而禁絕。但舞女方面却似乎沒有意見，更不見準備去市府請願，道並不是她們有守法的精神，而是她（他）們都可以說有了辦法。在舞場老　方面，他們早已準備組織</p>
<p>黑市舞塲</p>
<p>利用什麼聯誼會，或附設在某某同學會的名義，而乘機取巧，開設那表面非營業而實際營業的舞會，生意既可照做，捐稅又可豁免，這當然是個最好的如意算盤。在舞女方面，更不成問題，有辦法的，己陸續轉到香港澳門去，實行易地發展，賺港幣當然比賺國幣要好上幾倍哩！就算留在這裏一時不能走的，她們也大可轉業歌伶，或者酒樓的女招待，收入也不會少。雖然有人預料禁舞以後，私娼人數必會增加，但這是後話了。總之，廣州執行禁舞，是絕不成問題的，社會局負責人都也曾這樣說。</p>
<p>舞禁對市稅收入有影響嗎？當局的答復是：「絕然影響」。這倒是句老實話，因爲市稅</p>
<p>每月收入</p>
<p>最大宗的，我們就以八月份計算，除了營業稅以外，便是屠宰稅與筵席稅，計屠宰稅收入共達六億四千餘萬元，筵席稅是四億一千餘萬元，娛榮稅的總額雖然有四億五千餘萬元，但這裏包括劇塲電影院以及其他娛樂稅，共巾屬於從舞場收入的，實在是一個很少的數目。所以說對稅收沒有影響，絕對可信的。可是，在這裏又發生了一個問題，就是：禁舞是爲子要簡約消費，以配合全國總動員令，但舞禁了，是否就眞正能够盡了節約的任務呢？這在廣州實在還有疑問。我們在上列的稅收數字便可見到，廣州人在舞場的消費，恐怕有限，而消費在飲食上面，才是一個龐大的數字，廣州大茶樓酒館數目之多，冠全國其他都市，這可作爲「食在廣州」的新解釋。而且每一大酒樓，必有</p>
<p>花枝招展</p>
<p>的女侍，一家酒樓的生意好壊，　視其女招待漂亮與否，及能否逢迎顧客而定。由此可見有一部份人，他們不一定要飲食方上酒樓，所謂醉翁之意，並不在酒，而他們在酒樓上的消費，也實在較之在舞塲，要多上數十倍，所以在廣州要厲行節約，還要從飲食方面去想辦法，才能收到實效哩。（特派員梁風）</p>

<p>銀根略轉鬆動華股市勢盤旋</p>
<p>華股昨銀根初緊後平，塲外交貨不易，急於交貨者，且有貼價二三元者，上午賣風不斷，再被壓低，後市祇做即交，似已暫　，且臨收時連壓多日之九一號，亦止賣旁觀，交易大减，形勢已露秀氣，趨勢多盤　晨開時，除新華開高外，餘尙平疲，遞永紗開後，先低繼回，曾升至二七〇元光景。旋以塲外交貨不易，息價又開高至二角七及三角一分牛，逐漸盤低至二六〇元及二六三元低價。中途雖升至即交二六三元，遞交二六六元，但頗費掙扎。近午再低至二六〇元及二六三元低價，臨收復以即交二六二元，遞交二六四元之價收市，收後喊價見昂。給果較前收即交股永紗美亞華　新光景福中法勤興內衣景　中絲統益榮豐恒豐閘北微挫，信和巾紡跌半成，新華微升，　　跌一成，遞交股計永紗美亞華鹽微挫，信和跌牛成。</p>
<p>後市僅做即交永紗，開高至二六六元後，成交有限，聞國行交換差出，而小升至二六八元，旋微降至二六四元半，臨收時風平浪靜，永紗以二六六元結束。結果較晟收即交股計永紗信和美亞華豐景福勤興微升，新華漲半成，中法內衣京綸新光恒　均平，餘者升降咸微，塲外各老股若大生中華世界均吿疲落。</p>
<h3>統債買多上漲　外股起伏狹隘</h3>
<p>公債昨以戰前存款定一千倍至二千五百倍償還，日內有可以公佈施行之說，買戶興齊，所漲甚多。統丙晨開一四五〇〇元，自一四二〇〇元起，聲漲到一七六〇〇元，而後稍回。最後在一六五〇〇元左右掙扎，五五五室五五〇室均納，五〇三室五三八室則出，五五二室光進後出，成交約八百萬。結果較前收，計甲乙升二千一，統丙漲起三千三，統丁升二千元，統戊好起一千元。</p>
<p>外股昨橡皮股有合盛洋行吸收，獨現俏利，熟股反形盤旋，錢兌業猶太商有買，洋商證券帮則出。怡紗晟開一二八〇〇〇元，高價一二九五〇〇元，向後稍平，起仆甚微。結果較前收計鋼業尙平，怡紗紙業怡　航業　降，英聯會德豐業廣微升。</p>
<h3>食米上落細</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬四干石有零，市况早緊午懈，結果粳秈均少上落，白元亦少波動。南路　種百哥來源漸增後，新粳前途未許樂觀。</p>
<p>麵粉先堅後疲，微升一二千元，統粉亦加一二千元，配粉照常不動，麩皮初漲後回，結局彷彿。豆餅汕頭去胃冷淡，市形平平。芝豆油略有抬取，本街零化有勁，來源寥落，客心頗堅，回升三五千元，頗俱脚地。</p>
<p>菉豆南洋靑島均有納胃，步漲六七千元，紅糧營口採辦，挺進三五千元。苞米北洋進胃不爽，市勢站立。生仁廣帮見懈，頓形軟化，挫落一二萬元。芝蔴平局，小麥節節上升，粉市盤翔，隨之續漲萬餘元。囂豆　靑去化香燥，均由閩省興化購進，以充桂圓肥料之用，猛加一二萬元。</p>
<p>油市今日食油公司配出桶生油六千餘桶，均爲另售商訊購，生油漲勢已定，豆油消化活潑，再升二三萬元。菜油則狂漲三四萬元，惟蔴油供求兩少，依然平淡，淸油僅升萬元。</p>
<p>食油公司拋售生油</p>

<h3>配價再行折减　人造絲平穩　廠經市况疲弱綱貨堅定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局所公佈之本週人造絲配價，因絲商耍求，照上週市價實足八折計算，故配價已再行折减。計二Ａ東洋大富貴三七七二萬元，其他四種三七二四萬元。三Ａ東洋大富貴三六五八萬元，其他四種三六一〇萬元。</p>
<p>又訊：人造絲中信局配售量，自本週起减少十分之四，且係三只Ａ貨，故昨市銀根雖仍緊迫，而行情頗呈平穩。一二〇號雜牌有光，上午開盤喊五百六七十萬元，東洋六百十萬元有成交，後維牌退做五百五十萬元，下午因有拋售，最後價小至五百三十萬元，天橋五十萬元，東洋七十萬元，均爲賣出價，比上日下午最後價短六七十萬元之譜。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>市况疲弱，在有供無求之情况下，行情續趨下游，各級五担頭喊價均跌落五十萬元左有，且乏成交。昨日只有做開幾祖另担，中級三百萬元，高另担四百萬元，千經喊價，亦隨之而低落。</p>
<p>綢貨昨市尚稱堅穩，眞絲被面比上日軋小五六萬元，大誠與華强貨，開市喊七百萬元，最小跌至六百八十萬元，收市做六百九十六萬元即期價，隔日期七百十五萬元。格子　縐喊價在六萬元左右，並無成交。華錦縐價在四萬元左右，其餘各貨，俱乏異動，不過交易極稀</p>
<p>香烟價跌</p>
<p>昨日捲烟市面，賣多於買，行情狂瀉，午後市氣微回，但最後十支大英烟，比上日仍跌去五十五萬，老刀牌猛瀉八十萬元，哈德門亦挫七十萬元，其餘巾外各烟價亦一致下游。</p>

<p>紗價回挺　　昨日棉紗市况，客帮頗多乘低進取，廠家則未願輕易開售，故收市行情均告上展。量後四二支藍鳳紗比上日回漲四十五萬爲二千五百六十五萬元，廿支特雙馬軋升二十萬，輕變馬升五十萬元，十六支及十支粗紗去化較淸，價呈平定。共他各牌粗細紗，榮多辱少。</p>
<p>棉布略升</p>
<p>昨日棉布市况，初開因銀根未鬆，浮多了結吐售，行情續挫。龍頭細布曾小至六十一萬五千元，嗣以染廠及客帮有吸，最後龍頭細布回高六十三萬九千元，比上日回漲一萬九千。五福藍鷄彩球等亦好五千至二萬二三千元，嗶嘰金蓮妙舞及四君子客胃甚健，軋升一萬至二萬三千元。漂布下挫，士林粗布花布等堅挺。</p>
<p>棉花疲軟</p>

<h3>外銷茶交易稀</h3>
<p>昨日茶市，本街及客帮對於各種內銷茶，仍有問訊，形勢遂猶活躍，脚地異常穩固。至於外銷花色，賣戶雖有扳抬之念，買方則　納殊細，且鑒於國外出價並不寬裕，因此目前亦不願急於高價進取，致收市結果·交易依然寥落。趨勢　呈徘徊之狀。</p>
<h3>食糖續跌</h3>
<p>昨糖市因北路車運有阻，去化轉呆，價乃　軟。公會劃盤，現貨二〇中砂白小三萬餘元，爲七十九萬五千元至七十九萬元。合赤八十萬元，四半白八十八萬元至九十四五萬元，汕提靑平定，爲六十九萬五千元至六十九萬元，棉赤七十二萬七千元至五千元，計百餘包。興化白小二三萬元，爲七十七八萬元。簍裝七十五萬元至七十萬元。興赤小三四萬元爲六十六七萬元，計四百件之譜。刁靑呌小萬元，亦未成交。</p>

<h3>讀者信箱　大學生失戀後的狼狽　女方為家長反對棄舊戀新</h3>
<p>編輯先生：忍受着萬分惡劣的情緒，我給你寫了這對信，我不知道該不該這樣做，但是我畢竟如此做了，眞抱歉得很。事實的經過是這樣的：在去年的夏天，我從遙遠的東北來到了這全國最大的都會上海，費了很大的精力攷入了一所國立大學，開始了我的大學生活。在進校後的二個月，我認識了一位女同學，無論在學業·品行·禮貌上講起來，都够得上我理想中的伴侶的標準，我們每天在一起上課·實騐·遊戲，友誼的感情也一天天的加深起來。當然，一對正在靑春期的男女，假使是志趣相投的話，是很容易墮入愛情的漩渦裏去的，我們自然也不能例外。漸漸的由友誼而發生了戀愛，我們互相宣誓，我們是一定能够白頭偕老的。</p>
<p>今年的夏天，我乘暑假回到北方去，同時她也回到四川的家中，事情的變化往往是出人意外的，我眞不相信在短短的二個月裏面，我們間的愛情竟會遭受到如此嚴重的打擊。暑假結束，我重行回到上海，同時她從四川寄了一封信給我，大意是她的雙親反對我們的婚姻，她說，我們從前的約定已經沒有實現的可能！一個思想健全的女性，會如此容易的對舊禮敎低頭屈膝，我不相信眞有這回事，我不相信一個曾經愛過我的女子會對我說出這種話，我接到她的信以後，我的精神受到莫大的打擊，我感到生之空　，我對於一切都趨於消極起來。現在她已來到上海，我們仍是同學，但她對我的態度已經完全改變，很少和我講話，總是設法避開我。</p>
<p>先生，你一定能够想像得到我這些日子是如何在生活着的？我的學業有顯著的退步，我常常用烟酒來麻醉自己，雖然道是對我有害的，但我無法自拔！今天我寫這信給您，希望您能够給我一點指示，使我能够得到一點生存的意義。專祝　撰安　　者徐儀敬上</p>

<h3>中國佛敎史略</h3>
<p>— 林野</p>
<p>（釋印順。妙欽合編，三十六年大法輸畫局印價六千元）</p>
<p>「中國今日的問題是整個文化革新的問題在這整個革新中，宗敎思想，宗敎生活的革新，我認爲是最基本最深遠的工作。……如果宗敎革新是中國文化再生中必需的工作，那麽，佛敎—中國宗敎傳統中主流之一——的革新運動無疑地値得社會上開明人士的熱烈歡迎與讚助的·」</p>
<p>—本書篇首林同濟先生序</p>
<p>這是一本薄薄（只有八九十頁）的「佛敎史略」，並非甚麼了不得的大著作。但它有其獨立的特點，所以仍値得在此介紹。</p>
<p>治中國佛敎史，與一般歷史不同：第一，要能充分認淸佛敎在印度本土流傳演化的史跡；第二，對於釋迦牟尼全部遺敎要有相當深刻地瞭解。道該是很明顯的事實</p>
<p>本書作者印順法師對於印度佛敎的硏究成就如何，讀過「印度之佛敎一，「唯識學探源」的人，都會知道，用不淸這里再辭費。我願意擷引「唯識學探源」自序里的一段話以見中印佛敎相關涉的密切並作者治史觀點的一斑：</p>
<p>「在印度大乘佛教開展中，唯心論有真心派妄心派兩大流，傳到中國來就有地諭師，攝論師，唯識師三派。此兩大流，眞心派從印度東方的大衆分別說系發展而來；妄心派從印度西方的說一切有系中出來……東方的經典，總是時代的先進者　西方的論師們承受他思想的啓發，給予嚴密的思辨化，又多少要修正它。這種東西印度的風格不同；不僅是第三期的唯心佛敎，就是前二期的佛敎也有此種情形。」</p>
<p>在本畫裘這種「區城文化」的特色，更加周詳地叙述到了。我們只要看它八章正文里，四章的題目上就强調地顯示着空間性，就可以明白。全書目次如下：　緒言，　佛敎之輸入中國；　大道南行；　一帆風順之南朝佛敎，　唯心論之確立，　中原佛敎之體　，　新佛敎之成長，　南北西東與中華，　佛敎在平流起落中，　「變」這算是本書的一個結論。</p>
<p>其餘，在內容裏叙及「時空密切關係」的地方，紙不勝畫，任舉幾點：「南朝百數十年之佛敎，自北而南凡四變……南方以妙有爲究竟，然與眞空並行而反唯心之緩起　，與北朝之價常唯心之綠起論迥異（頁二五—二六）。南朝之義學雖以真常妙有爲宗，而實能融合兩晋來之學統；玄思深邃，非北學司及。然以言行通履，則昔之關洛重化濟事功，江東主謹嚴拔俗，以此衡量南朝佛敎，則頗嫌文不勝質。北人樸質，玄思名理非所長，多爲事相之　，精苦之行：如大同雲岡之石刻，洛陽伊闕龍門……其建築雕刻之宏偉莊嚴非南朝可及。南禪以湘之南嶽，贛之南昌，安吉爲中心，或東南移而入閩，浙，粵北之山地，或西北向，自灃州渡江北上荊，裏，南陽而化行河洛。佛敎承統一之運，以政治之界域不存，南北爲相互之交流。隋唐政治以北統南，而學術則北爲南化。昔晋之衰，五胡亂而佛敎南；今則以唐之衰，五代亂而佛敎北。自後，佛敎中心常在南方」。賀昌羣先生說：「歷史之硏習必先決定史事之時空關係，而後史　演變之觀念，方明確而無茫昧之感」。（中國歷史參考圖譜題辭）可以充分地證明這種看法是不錯的。</p>
<p>全畫綱領在「緒言」里有很槪括地叙述：</p>
<p>流行將近一千九百年的中國佛敎，自承受印度方面說：漢魏兩晋所傳相當於印度的中期佛敎；南北朝到北宋所傳相當於印度的後期佛敎。自流行中國方面說，也可分成兩個時期：「一，上自漢魏下迄隋唐，爲承受思辨時期（約偏勝說）。傳譯而思辨之，條貫之，其特色爲融貫該綜。得則華貴宏偉，失則繁文縟節，如世家子。確樹此一代之風者，襄陽釋道安也。二，上起李唐下迄淸季，爲延續篤行時期。即所知而行之證之，其特色爲簡易平實。得則渾樸忠誠，失則簡陋貧乏，如田舍郞。確樹此一代之風者，嶺南僧焉能也。思辨該綜之佛敎，初惟「性空」之一味；繼分化爲南之「眞空妙有」，北之「眞常唯心」；極其量，成大乘八宗之瑰奇。篤行簡易之佛敎，初承諸宗而隱爲二流，即天台之「真空妙有」，禪者之「眞常唯心」；極其致，成禪，敎，律，淨之渾融」（頁一—二）。中國佛敎源遠流長，已不僅是流行於中國的佛敎，進而成爲中國所有的佛敎了。</p>
<p>在目前佛敎史略畫極度貧乏的狀况下，本畫頗値一讀。不過它也不是沒有司商的地方；因爲這是一本簡括地「史略」，作者想是力圖節省文字，徵引「原文」或古籍「成語」地方很多。第一，沒有註明出處，第二，也沒有利用古文今譯的辦法——註明「今語」；這，未免不便初學閱續。如果不是筆者看法錯懊的話，希望將來在再版時能斟酌予以補救！會比現在更理想些。</p>
<h3>朝聖行脚　彬之</h3>
<p>— 葉秋原著</p>
<p>北平上智編釋館出版</p>
<p>「朝聖行脚」，是葉秋原先生記游歐美之作，葉先生於三十年夏，出國考察天主敎的文化事業，經印度，而美國，而英倫，而羅馬，環繞地球一週，壓時年餘。其時正値大戰方酣，　地瘡痍戰跡，故旅歷所見與和平時又非異趣。宗敎家素主和平，天主敎在各地所辦的文化事業，即在散佈和平之種子，但其收獲如何，平日尚不十分顯著，而在戰時看來，更易知其成效多寡。</p>
<p>本畫採游記之文禮，然葉先生此行，以考察天主敎文化事業爲主，則其所注意的，也自然偏重於這一方面。故此畫所記，以天主敎爲主，至於各地的景物文化，祇是敎會活動的背景而已。本來宗敎有世界性的，但各地的風俗習尙不同，宗敎的活動，也要隨各地的環境而異。天主敎已散佈到世界每一角，所辦的文化出版事業，成續都很可觀，這不能不歸功於天主敎各地的主敎司鐸等善於利用當地的環境，畫巾對於這一點，講得十分地詳細。</p>
<p>全畫除小引外，分爲五十一節。內四節記旅途情形，有二節講印度的天主敎情形，廿一節記美洲各地的敎會，十九節記英倫一天主敎的活動，五節講羅罵的朝聖。紫先生喜歡從文化的觀點上探求敎理，所以他沿途所見，凡與天主敎演進有關的，莫不探本求源。若在美國，他發現了天主敎從舊大陸傳至新大陸的路綫，和在美洲發展的經過。在英國，他追尋天主敎在英倫三島演變的經過。在印度，雖然那裏是佛敎一的發源地，但天主敎也有很多的一信徒，他指出東方天主敎的特種事業。羅馬的梵帝崗，是天主敎的聖地，那裏有更多的遺跡，來表揚天主敎的高超和聖潔。所以從這畫裏，可以知道天主敎過去的演變，各地流傳的經過，如何建立許多偉大的事業，和各地文化發展的關係。</p>
<p>這本書，不僅是一册游記，我們可以作爲「天主敎潑展史」看也司以當作文化史的一部門夾讀。天主敎在中國，已有很久的　史，各地的敎會，辦了許多神聖的事業。我們對於天主敎在中國的流傳，已經知道一點，但對於他在世界各地情形，大都較爲隔膜。這一本畫，可以從簡潔輕鬆的文字中，來明瞭天主敎在世界各地的文化活動。</p>
<h3>「家庭科學談」</h3>
<p>— 孟琨　法布爾著宋易譯</p>
<p>開明靑年叢書之一</p>
<p>有些學者往往並本以他所硏究的主科而出名，本畫的著者便是一例。法布爾（J.H.Fabre）是法國的昆虫學家，同時又是一通俗科學的寫作者，他從後者所得到的盛譽甚於前者，他有無數不同語言不同膚色的老小讀者羣。跟海登敎授一般，他的名字也被我們熟悉了，他的不少小册子，早就絡續地被翻譯過來，流傳在兒童與成年人的手與手之間。他是海登以前唯一能以通俗科學的常識來灌輸給人們的一位學者，只是他寫得更通俗，更生動，更易解，且更便利於接受，以及更與日常生活有關而已。</p>
<p>作爲一種通俗讀物，在若干方面是尤難於專門著述的。要寫得活潑，而不枯燥；由淺入深，有步驟；與生活有關，司供體　；靈巧，趣味，和吸引。這一些，法布爾不僅是一能手，還是一首創者。近來的一些兒童或少年們靑年們的讀物都雜有故事和人物了，借一位人物的說話去抽繹出各條科學的眞面目，那方法便是法布爾發明的。本書的「保羅叔」已成爲智慧的象徵，處處替他的侄兒喻兒或愛密兒和侄女克萊兒或瑪莉解釋他們（她們）在日常生活裏所碰到的不可明白的事件；這樣，讀者也不知不覺地，有秩序地，在接受「保羅叔」誨人不倦的灌輸了。多聰敏的，變枯燥爲生動，舉例，猜度，比喩，科學常識披上層和諧的外套，任何人都感到可親。你讀這畫，如在對談，如在聽詩人抒情地吟誦，讀到的不是方程式，不是定律，不是臆設或學說，而祗是美麗的散文，俏媚的小品。</p>
<p>這一本畫，較同作者其餘的作品更合實用，更與人們的日常有緊接的關係。共分五十三章，每章自三千字至五千字，單獨地分析一件事，直到讀者全盤認識後始止；每竟自成一段落，又和上理的二章有綫索依着。排列得極目然，佈置得極合理，聯絡得極有秩序。</p>
<p>最初的十三　是講衣着物的，從紗，絲，羊毛，麻，絨等談到各種最慣見的布料，以及染印的一些常識，還有如何織，如何綫，和附屬於衣着的一般，如扣針；很完備，然而不深奧，又不　缺了什麽。以下第十四章到第十六章討論「熱的傳導」「人類的住所」有非常淺顯的例解。再下面的十五章是介紹日常用品的來由，製造，應用，與性質的文字，這裏一共舉出了灰，碳酸鉀，肥皂，火柴，柴炭，煤和煤氣，火油，玻璃，再剖析幾種日常經過的現象，火，熱，燃燒，光，鐵和銹，鐵錫和陶磁器等。於是講食的部門，一共占本畫一半的篇幅，直到底，共研究過糖，咖啡，茶，鹽，油，水，醋，麵包，米，和其他一共二三十件東西；却循循善誘地，不漏去一些該提出的，也不累贅地使觀衆疲乏。</p>
<p>如請「光」的這一課題時，保羅叔先列舉人類在黑暗裏取火的各種方法的邁進，講到每一類取火方法的特質和缺點，經濟與否，再講到幾種蠟燭製造過程，於是講油的所以能燃燒，講燃燒發光的一般原則，如何利用通風而使得更明亮，講燈的道理和烟的道理，分析所謂燈蕊，所謂保險燈，美孚燈，最後歸源到空氣和燃燒的關係。本須用很多字來記載的，保羅叔講到那麼簡短；本來需要有些兒修養的人才看得懂，保羅叔寫得那麼孺媼均解；本來就是懂了也不見得即能應用的，保羅叔却從實踐出發，不至空洞。</p>
<p>總之，本畫和牠的姊妹作都是同樣地有益於大衆的。形式方面，以通俗爲特點；內容方面，以實用爲基礎。這就够了，可供一般國民們閱讀，使他們的生活逐漸改換得合於科學，使他們對於各種日常遇到的事物都自己能科學地去解釋，科學地去應付，不至於依賴傳統的迷信或惶惑地祇是徘徊着了。</p>
<p>法布爾生於一八二三年，死於一九一五年，他書中有些較舊的科學觀念和科學見解，都給譯者補充或改動了，有的加了注。跟這小冊子一樣性質的書有「科學的故事」（宋易譯），「化學奇談」（顧均正譯），「家畜的故事」（成紹宗譯），大多有開明版，也還有二種以上的譯本。這些書都相似，但以「家常科學談」爲最切一般人民的生活。法布爾最著名的不朽鉅作是「昆蟲記」，一共十六卷，前無古人，後無來者，我國有王大中譯的，不全，去年商務出版，也能作爲趣味性的常識讀本看。</p>
<h3>守望萊茵河</h3>
<p>— 施濟美　著者Lillian　Hellman　譯者　馮亦代</p>
<p>出版　新羣出版社</p>
<p>「守望萊茵河」是美國戲劇作家麗琳，海爾曼女士一九四四年的作品，曾經攝製爲電影，舞台劇在百老匯上演時，紐約時報的劇評家艾金生氏評爲：「這是海爾曼女士所寫的最佳作品……是齣極重要的戲。戲劇界應該爲這劇本感到驕傲」。</p>
<p>故事發生於一九四○年的暮春，在美國，離開華盛頓約廿哩的鄉間，法萊利家裏，男主人育岌·法萊利已經逝世了，他的太太芳尼，今年六十三歲，風姿依然，是個神經緊張的婦人，她的兒子大衛，年已三十九歲，尙未娶親，現在和寄住的瑪莎·特·白郞柯維斯橋得很好，芳尼爲此大爲不快，因爲瑪莎是有夫之　，她的丈夫德克，是羅馬尼亞的怕爵，但是這一對貴族住在法萊利家，欠債　　，很是貧窮。</p>
<p>這一天早晨，芳尼比平時更外的興奮和緊張，因爲她的二十年沒有見過面的女兒莎拉，女婿戈特·繆勒，帶着三個小孩回來了。—從多難的歐洲回來了。</p>
<p>廿年的別離，一且骨肉重逢，歡喜自不待言，芳尼高興得連自已當初曾猛烈反對這段因綠的事也忘了；一家人全很激動。只有那個名呌德克的羅馬尼亞貴族，用他尖銳的眼旁觀，冷冷的偵査一切，這一羣衣衫襤褸，到處流浪的人，孩子能說好多地方的方言，作工程師的戈特臉上會有槍傷，手上的骨頭也斷了；尤共古怪的是，他們的行李不上鎖，而一隻破舊的公文皮包却鎖得很牢固。因此伯爵起了疑心，他開始像一頭機警的獵犬一樣，隨時隨地的準備攫取牠的目的物。</p>
<p>終於在十天之後，時機成熟了。起初是極平靜的薄暮，後來漸形緊張，因爲德克吿訴戈特午報上一則新聞，德國的反納粹地下活動首領麥克斯，弗雷登上校被捕了。麥克斯是戈特的同志，好朋友，所以戈特要走了。但是狡猾的德克知道了一切，他提出一個買賣，一萬元？或是報吿德國大使館？由他選擇。然而戈特說：他的錢是公衆的捐款，而不是給他個人買命的；僵持了許久，芳尼和大衛急於打發這個無恥的貴族，願意付出這筆款子，當他們到樓上取錢的時候，戈特將德克殺死了。而他，戈特·繆勒，他自已今天晚上也就要走了，因爲他要去創造一個新的理想的世界，他吻了孩子們，再轉向莎拉，他說：「願這活的人一定有最好的機會活下去。我要活。我要和你一塊兒活下去」。</p>
<p>這就是「守望萊茵河」的故事，以第二次世界大戰爲背景，故事中雖不曾正面寫到戰爭的實况，但是作者却極其明確的吿訴了我們這一次戰爭的偉大意義，以及戰地工作者的神聖，且試看戈特·繆勒說的話；「……我們說這世界不像樣，因爲有餓肚子的人。在世界像樣之前，人們就要偸竊，說謊——殺人。但不論是爲了什麽緣故，是誰做的……這全不是好事。我要你們記住這一點，不論是誰做的，這是壊事情。但是你們都可以活着看到這個世上不會再殺人了，整個世界，每個地方，每個城市，總有人要負資不使殺人的事情發生。他們和我們一樣需要：把愉快的童年給每個孩子。給我的兒女們，我也爲了他們的兒女，想想吧，這會使你快活。在世界上每個城市，每個鄕邨，每間房屋，總有被人寵愛的孩子，他會給他造一個好的世界。……這個世界襄的每個人都可以平安的死在床上……」</p>
<p>只要還有人活着受罪，那我們大家都有罪的。也許，那並不是我們的罪呀，但是看到這世界依舊的不像樣，依舊還有餓肚子的人，依舊有殺人放火的事情發生，人們連平平安安死去的幸福都沒有；孩子們依舊沒有愉快的童年。……運一切，即使不是我們的罪，我們不覺得慚愧麼？——這一本畫啓示了我們活着的人，應試有「不受罪」的權利，同時也該明白怎樣自己就是我們「有罪」。明白這一個世界不應如此的「不像樣」，而也得知道「像樣」的世界是每一個人應該努力去創造和公平的享受。</p>
<p>作者麗琳·海爾曼女士生於一九〇五年，除本書外，尙著有「兒童的時間」，「小狐狸」，「未來的日子」，「寒風料峭」等劇，她是一個嚴　辛動的劇作家，寫作態度認眞，題旨嚴肅，一筆不苟，其作品則結構緊湊，人物生動，對話流利，生活逼眞，且針對美國現實。</p>

<h3>Recovery of Yantai and Consolidation of Jiaodong; National Army in Western Anhui Enters Qianshan; Gu Zhutong Arrives in Xuzhou from Zhengzhou to Take Command</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Qingdao, This Newspaper, 1st] The National Army officially recovered Yantai at 9:30 AM on the 1st. The supply line of the Communist bandits in North China via Daisu Sea has been cut off, and the entire strategy of the Communist bandits has completely failed. In addition, the important base of the bandit army in Jiaodong, Mount Juchi, has also been recovered, and the mop-up operation against the remaining scattered bandits is underway. The news of the recovery of Yantai was first reported by aerial reconnaissance. The Air Force witnessed the National Army entering Yantai city in a steady stream. The military immediately issued a message stating: "Under the strong cover of the Navy and Air Force, our Que Hanqian's troops (54th Army) launched a general attack on Yantai yesterday (30th) morning. After a night of fierce fighting, all resistance of the bandits was destroyed, and Yantai was completely recovered at 9:30 AM this morning. The war gains are being investigated."</p>
<p>After the recovery of Yantai, the 6th and 13th Columns of the bandit army attempted to break through to the west, but were surrounded by the National Army in the area between the Jiao River and the Han River and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. In the Haiyang area, more than 10,000 bandits are fleeing westward to the area north of Lingshan. The two groups of remaining bandits are clearly attempting to cross the rear of the National Army and enter the mountainous area of southern Shandong. They have been continuously encircled and annihilated and pursued by the Army and Air Force.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 1st] Chairman Chiang instructed all units of the National Army advancing toward Yantai to pay special attention to protecting the churches and church personnel in the area after the recovery of Yantai.</p>
<p>(Director Deng Wenyi of the Ministry of National Defense News Bureau reports on the significance of the recovery of Yantai and other military news, printed on page 2)</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Hankou, This Newspaper, 1st] The National Army recaptured Qianshan City in western Anhui on September 29th. The remaining bandits retreated to the Houling area in the northwest.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, This Newspaper, 1st] The remnants of Chen Yi's four columns, numbering between 20,000 and 30,000, a part of the bandits fled eastward across the Jinpu Railway from Jia Gou Li Village on the 30th. Also, the bandits who fiercely attacked the Su County Station and the Fu Li Station on the afternoon of the 30th were repelled by the National Army. Furthermore, more than 7,000 bandits who fled to the border between Xiao County and Yongcheng on the night of the 30th are being encircled and suppressed by the National Army. Gu Zhutong flew from Zhengzhou to Xuzhou on the 30th to take command.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Kaifeng, 1st] Tian Zhongjie, the magistrate of Sui County, led his troops to repel the Communist bandits and completely recapture the county seat at 10:00 AM today.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Discusses Sino-Soviet Relations; Both Parties May First Exchange Opinions; Control of Japan Should Be Thoroughly Implemented</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Government Commissioner Wang Chonghui stated yesterday, "Regarding the recent Sino-Soviet relations, the government has always had the desire to improve the diplomatic relations between the two countries. The problem is that a set of methods is needed. I personally advocate that China and the Soviet Union should each send high-ranking officials to exchange opinions on the overall problems between the two countries for a considerable period of time, and to discuss openly to explore the real crux of the problems. China may first propose this matter to the other party to show our sincerity. As for whether there will be results, it is another matter. If Sino-Soviet relations can be improved, it will be of considerable benefit to the solution of internal problems." According to reports, Wang had a meeting with Vice Foreign Minister Ye Gongchao, who came to Shanghai, yesterday to broadly exchange views on the Japanese peace treaty issue. Wang believes that the period of controlling Japan should be quite long, at least twenty years, until every provision in the peace treaty is thoroughly implemented and the thinking of its people is thoroughly changed before the Allied control of Japan can be ended. During the control process, it would also be permissible for China to send a small number of troops to be stationed in Japan.</p>
<h3>US Senators and Representatives Cancel Visit to the Far East; Several Legislators Plan to Visit the Far East in a Private Capacity</h3>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Washington, 30th] The Senate Military Committee announced today that the committee, along with members of other committees of the Senate and House of Representatives currently visiting Europe, has canceled its planned five-week visit to China, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines. However, some members are very interested in conducting on-site investigations into the situation in the Far East. In the coming weeks, they still plan to visit the above-mentioned areas in a private capacity, possibly including the islands of the Pacific, and then return home. Among them are Democratic Senator Hatch, Barkley, Green, Republican Senator Young, Gordon, and Republican Representative Jutte. The intentions of other Representatives have not yet been decided. They will gather in Cairo on October 1 and fly to Manila on a civilian aircraft, and then travel to various parts of the Far East on a US military aircraft.</p>
<h3>Governor of Hong Kong Arrives in Nanjing; To Pay Respects to the Chairman Today</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 1st] Sir Grantham, the newly appointed Governor of Hong Kong, and his wife flew to Nanjing from Hong Kong on a special plane at 4:00 PM on the 1st. They are scheduled to pay respects at the Mausoleum on the 2nd, and then pay respects to Chairman Chiang to offer their respects. They will meet with reporters on the 3rd and return to Hong Kong on the 4th. (Continued on page 2)</p>
<h3>China to Dispatch Special Plane to Hong Kong to Welcome British Delegation to Visit Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 1st] The six-member British parliamentary delegation to China has departed from London and is heading east. Our government is preparing to send a special plane to Hong Kong to welcome them to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Official Discusses Smuggling; Says China Should Be Responsible</h3>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Hong Kong, 1st] According to Sims Worth, Hong Kong government's Director of Imports and Exports, smuggling between Hong Kong and mainland China is mainly due to the tacit approval of Chinese officials and the high trade barriers established by the Chinese government, which prohibit goods that consumers demand and that have a legitimate market in China. (Sims' speech is on page 2)</p>
<h3>Recent Price Fluctuations; Reasons for Volatility; Overall Price Increases Stimulate Grain Prices</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 1st] According to sources related to the matter, the price fluctuations in Nanjing and Shanghai began in late August. Initially, there were fluctuations in cotton cloth, and cigarettes and fuel also showed sharp increases. The price of rice in Shanghai remained stable at around 400,000 yuan before August 27th. Starting from the 28th, it began to rise due to high prices in the production area (Wuxi). This proves that overall price increases stimulate grain prices, not that grain prices lead overall prices. Since entering September, the situation has become even more intense due to the westward flight of the Communist bandits and the tense situation in Anhui and Hubei, which has hindered the downward transportation of rice and grain. In terms of national prices in September, cotton cloth and other goods have generally risen sharply in various regions, while rice prices, except for fluctuations in the Nanjing and Shanghai area, have mostly fallen in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River and southeastern provinces due to the abundance of new goods or difficulties in external transportation. There have also been no fluctuations in North China and Northeast China. The prices of various goods have become unbalanced. As new rice enters the market in Nanjing and Shanghai, it will flood in large quantities, and recent price declines in production areas indicate that prices may gradually stabilize.</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Meets with US President; Discusses the Current Situation in China; Did Not Mention Loans or General Wedemeyer's Investigation; Contents of Negotiations with Secretary Marshall Kept Secret</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Dispatch from Washington, 30th, United Press] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, accompanied by Ambassador Wellington Koo, told reporters after a courtesy visit to the White House today that he had the opportunity to discuss the world and China's situation with President Truman. He informed President Truman about the current situation in China and found that President Truman was already very familiar with the situation in China. They did not discuss matters related to loans to China or the investigation of the situation in China and Korea by General Wedemeyer. Wang confirmed that he had requested a meeting with President Truman. Assistant Secretary of State Acheson and experts on Far Eastern affairs were present at the meeting. He also said that he would continue to stay in the United States for ten days, which is longer than he originally planned, as the United Nations may discuss matters related to China. Wang later met with Senator Connally, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Chinese Embassy is scheduled to host a banquet on the 1st to entertain leading figures in the US government.</p>
<p>[US Information Service Dispatch from Washington, 30th] Chinese Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Shijie stated that he had met with Secretary of State Marshall at the UN General Assembly. These negotiations have not yet been completed. Wang declined to disclose the contents of the negotiations.</p>
<p>[United Press Dispatch from Washington, 30th] Responsible officials said, "Judging from current signs, the Wedemeyer Report will not be released." The report that Wedemeyer submitted to President Truman on the results of his investigation into China and Korea is currently being kept strictly secret. As of now, only the White House and top officials of the State Department know about it, and both sides are tight-lipped about it.</p>
<p>[US Information Service Dispatch from Washington, 30th] A State Department spokesman stated today that he had no knowledge of the news from China that the United States plans to train ten divisions of the National Government's army. He said he had inquired with the Department of the Army about this matter, and they also had no knowledge of it.</p>
<h3>Import Tax on Gasoline, Kerosene, and Diesel Set at 50% Ad Valorem</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 1st] A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance stated that gasoline and diesel oil are goods subject to tax under the import tariff schedule. During the Anti-Japanese War, when the seaports fell and the Burma Road was blocked, the source of oil was hindered. In order to encourage merchants and civilians to transport oil to meet the needs of the time, the government decided to temporarily exempt gasoline and diesel oil from import tax starting in August of the 29th year of the Republic (1940). Since the restoration, the import of foreign goods has mostly resumed the 1934 import tariff schedule, which levied taxes ad valorem, but gasoline and diesel oil have not simultaneously resumed taxation due to the wartime measures being continued. The government is now striving to balance the budget and save on consumption, so it should resume the customs duties that should be levied on gasoline and diesel oil in order to increase revenue. In addition, because gasoline was previously tax-free, some unscrupulous retailers sold gasoline mixed with kerosene, or used tax-free diesel to distill kerosene to evade taxes. All of this needs to be corrected. In view of this, the Executive Yuan recently resolved at a meeting that the import tax on gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil will be uniformly increased to 50% ad valorem. Crude oil will be temporarily exempt from import tax. After receiving the order from the Executive Yuan on September 30, the Ministry of Finance immediately telegraphed the Inspector General of Customs to implement it. If the import quota for gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil this year is not reduced, then based on estimates for the three months of October, November, and December this year, the possible increase in customs revenue will be more than 200 billion yuan. (Implementation measures for the 50% ad valorem increase in import tax on fuel oil, see page 7)</p>
<h3>Zhang Junmai Goes to Nanjing</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Zhang Junmai, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, took the train to Nanjing last night to discuss the general election issue with relevant parties, as the nomination and proportional representation negotiations have not yet yielded results.</p>
<h3>Dong XianGuang Announces to the Press That Members of the Democratic League Participated in Rebellion; Headquarters Failed to Correct and Should Be Held Responsible</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Is it true that members of the Democratic League, such as Yan Baohang, hold important positions in the Communist bandits, and can you give details? This inquiry was answered by Director Dong XianGuang at a press conference on the afternoon of the 1st: In the Northeast region occupied by the Communist bandits, those who currently hold important positions are Yan Baohang, chairman of the pseudo-Liaobei Province, Yu Yifu, chairman of the pseudo-Nenjiang Province, Che Xiangchen, vice chairman, Han Youtong, director of the pseudo-Songjiang Province Education Department, Guan Mengjue, director of the pseudo-Nenjiang Province Education Department, and Gao Chongmin and Zhou Jingwen, administrative committee members of the joint administrative office of the pseudo-Northeast provinces and cities. The above-mentioned persons are only a few prominent examples. The Democratic League established a preparatory committee for the General Branch in the Communist area long ago, and the number of its members holding positions in the Communist area is not limited to these.</p>
<p>Yan Baohang and others accepted pseudo-orders in the capacity of the preparatory committee of the Democratic League's General Branch in the Communist area, betraying the government. This is an undeniable fact. The Democratic League headquarters has not heard of any expressions regarding these members who participated in the rebellion. However, in order to implement its anti-government and anti-constitutional propositions, it severely dealt with members who participated in the central government or the National Assembly, repeatedly causing them to withdraw from the League. In other words, Democratic League members have no freedom to participate in the constitution or accept central appointments, but can collude with the Communist Party to hold important positions in bandit areas and participate in actions to betray the government. Under this stark comparison, the position taken by the leaders responsible for the Democratic League's activities between the government and the Communist bandits is very clear.</p>
<p>Another fact is also worth our attention. After the government promulgated the Mobilization for Suppression of Rebellion and completed the Outline for the Implementation of Constitutional Government, Democratic League members engaged in inciting and sabotaging mobilization in various places. For example, the Hong Kong and Kowloon General Branch of the Democratic League issued a declaration in July, calling for action to resist general mobilization, attempting to obstruct the government's requisitioning measures. This statement incited rebellion and violated the law. It was issued in the name of the local general branch of the Democratic League. More than two months have passed, and the leaders responsible for the Democratic League's activities have never corrected it.</p>
<p>The activities of any political party are based on the guidelines established by its central organization. The Hong Kong and Kowloon General Branch of the Democratic League and its Communist Bandit General Branch Preparatory Committees have obvious facts of participating in or inciting rebellion. The Democratic League's leadership should have its own responsibilities in guidance.</p>
<p>In the past, the relationship between the Democratic League and the Communist bandits was close, and their propositions were consistent. This is a fact that is commonly seen in society and does not need to be elaborated. After the government issued the General Mobilization Order, some Democratic League members still did not know how to cherish themselves and openly held positions in the bandit area and participated in the rebellion. Its overseas general branches also made extensive propaganda, calling on the people to take action to resist the government. All these facts make people deeply believe that the Democratic League is not an independent political party, but an appendage of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>Luo Longji's Defense</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, This Newspaper, 1st] Luo Longji, a spokesman for the Democratic League, issued a statement at 11:00 PM on the 1st to defend himself against the issues involving the Democratic League raised by Dong XianGuang at a press conference on the 1st. He denied that Yan Baohang was a member of the Democratic League and that Zhou Jingwen had participated in the work of the Communist bandits. However, Luo admitted that "it is indeed a fact that Democratic League members hold positions in the Communist area," but argued that "they are all local positions and were taken before the announcement of the Suppression of Rebellion Order more than a year ago." He also refuted Dong's accusation that the Democratic League's remarks incited rebellion, and said that he did not know what the government spokesman's intention was in "attacking" the Democratic League at this time. The conclusion of his statement reiterated the Democratic League's position of not participating in any action that would strengthen the division of the country.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Civil Servant Benefits; Dong XianGuang Says Authorities Are Considering; Distribution of In-Kind Goods to Civil Servants and Teachers in Beiping and Tianjin Starting in September</h3>

<h3>Expectations for the Chinese Institute of Engineers</h3>
<p>The 14th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers and the Joint Annual Meeting of thirteen specialized engineering societies, including electrical and textile engineering, is scheduled to be held in the capital today. The total number of delegates attending this session exceeds one thousand, and the conference will last for five days. This is the first joint annual meeting after the victory restoration. We feel that in the post-war economic construction, the responsibility of engineers is significant, and we place infinite expectations on the convocation of this annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers.</p>
<p>Engineering is a practical science and technology after the industrial revolution, and engineers are specialized talents who apply scientific and technological knowledge. The joint organization of engineering societies began with the Institution of Civil Engineers in the United Kingdom in 1828. The joint organization of engineers in our country started with the Chinese Institute of Engineers and the Chinese Engineering Society in the early years of the Republic, and the Road Works Mutual Aid Society. The original founders were Zhan Tianyou and other advanced figures in the engineering field. Later, the three engineering groups merged to concentrate their strength, develop the engineering industry, and named it the "Chinese Institute of Engineers". Thirty articles of association were formulated, and the purposes were to standardize the construction system, develop the engineering industry, and promote engineering academics. At the first meeting, Zhan Tianyou was publicly elected as the president, and Yan Deqing and Xu Wenjiong were elected as the vice presidents. At the Nanjing Annual Meeting in 1931, it was resolved that the year when our country's first engineering group was organized would be the year of the association's founding. This symbolizes that the year of our country's founding was the year when our country's engineering industry sprouted and was established. In fact, since 1931, our country's engineering facilities and construction have been greatly contributed by our engineers. The organization of the Chinese Institute of Engineers is no less than the driving force of our country's industrial construction. Especially during the Anti-Japanese War, our country's engineering talents emerged in large numbers and made great contributions to the country and the people. Deceased engineers, such as Zhan Tianyou, Li Yizhi, Fan Xudong, and Zhang Xinfu, dedicated themselves to the engineering industry and did their best. The current engineering personnel are all adhering to their posts, down-to-earth, and vigorously developing. These can all serve as models for the general public.</p>
<p>China needs modernization, and the engineering industry and engineering construction have brilliant prospects. For the practical application of science and technology, and in order to catch up with the new century, at present, the absorption and research of engineering academics, and the cultivation and utilization of engineering talents, still require the efforts and dedication of various engineering technology groups. Academic groups are originally a combination of talents, in-depth research, and the combination of knowing and acting. Its development and its future are not in the form of annual meetings, but in the concentration and unification of forces for the development of its own business after the exchange of will at the annual meeting. The Chinese Institute of Engineers has a strict organization and a large number of talents. It has creeds and disciplines. In today's uncertain national crisis, all engineering facilities and engineering construction designs rely on engineers to strive for perfection and make further progress.</p>
<p>In the five thousand years of our country's national construction plan, there was Yu Gong in the past, and the Father of the Nation's industrial plan in the future. One Yu Gong once laid the foundation for our country's past five thousand years, just as one industrial plan will build the future five thousand years. Our country, thanks to the hard work of our ancestors, has roots and foundations, and fertile land awaits construction, and vast plains await development. And the industrial plan has already designed the pattern, magnificent, with warp and weft, pointing out the path for engineering personnel. Now and in the future, how to follow this ideal, practice innovation, this is the grand task of our country's engineers. The first article of the revised creed of the 30th annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers states: "Abide by the national defense and economic construction policies of the country and realize the industrial plan of the Father of the Nation". The second article states: "Recognize that the interests of the country and the nation are above all else, and be willing to sacrifice freedom and contribute ability". How great is its spirit and its ambition! Engineers are practical and law-abiding. Looking at the world trend and the national situation in the past six years, the task of our country's engineers is indeed very great. It is hoped that engineering personnel will establish their goals, recognize the interests of the country and the nation, contribute their academics and skills under the government's national defense and economic policies, and make arduous and unremitting efforts to realize the ideal of the Father of the Nation's industrial plan.</p>
<p>The Chinese Institute of Engineers has a bright and brilliant history in the past thirty years, and the future prospects are even greater and longer. We wish that the convening of this annual meeting will glorify the spirit of the association, promote the creed of the association, recognize the importance of one's own responsibility, strive for progress, and be consistent with the pace of the government and the people to jointly create a strong, prosperous, and happy new China.</p>
<h3>The Significance of Recovering Yantai Exceeds the Yan'an Campaign: Deng Wenyi's Report to Reporters</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The news of the National Army's recapture of Yantai in Jiaodong on the morning of the 1st greatly excited people here, who generally believe that the complete suppression of the communist bandits on the Shandong Peninsula is no longer a problem. Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, attended a press conference held by the News Bureau at 4:30 p.m. on the 1st and reported on military affairs, especially emphasizing the great significance of the National Army's recapture of Yantai. He said: "The National Army in Jiaodong began its offensive on September 15, advancing from Jimo, Jiaoxian, and Gaomi in three routes. Within half a month, Yantai has been recaptured." Deng then pointed out the strategic value of Jiaodong, saying: "After the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou, the transportation between the Northeast communist bandits and Shandong relied solely on Yantai in Jiaodong. Shandong's strong manpower and food supplies, and the Northeast's weapons and ammunition, were all transported through this channel. The recapture of this area by the National Army can determine the future fate of the communist bandits' failure, and its impact will be greater than that of the Yan'an campaign." This campaign shows that the communist army's attempt to cross the Yellow River, invade Anhui and Hubei, and threaten Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai to contain the Jiaodong battlefield has failed, and its impact on their morale is particularly great. The communist army implemented the "empty city tactics," withdrawing approximately 80% of the troops from Hebei and Shanxi to flee south, resulting in a depleted force in their hinterland. The National Army that recovered Jiaodong only needs half of its strength to recover the communist bandit areas in Hebei, and then restore Shanxi and reinforce the Northeast, recovering the territorial sovereignty of the Northeast." Deng concluded: "The Yantai campaign is a failure of the communist bandits' overall strategy, and it also eliminates the fatal crisis to national unification and construction since the end of the War of Resistance."</p>

<h3>The Central Government Plans to Develop the Datong Coal Mine; It Can Mine 20 Million Tons Annually</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] The central government has a large-scale development plan for the Datong Coal Mine. The trip of Sun Yueqi, Wang Yichen, Xu Houfu, and others to the Ping-Sui Railway this time is to lay the foundation for the exact plan. When President Zhang passed through Beiping, relevant parties made a brief suggestion to Zhang regarding this plan, and Zhang was very supportive. It is reported that the reserves of the Datong Coal Mine are extremely astonishing and can be designed to mine 20 million tons annually, or at least 10 million tons annually. The output value will also reach US$300 million annually. To achieve this goal, only US$4.5 million needs to be invested in the Datong Coal Mine, US$19.24 million in the railway, and US$6 million in Tanggu New Port. The total cost is only US$30 million. To enable Datong coal to be directly transported from the production area to Tanggu New Port, the railway authorities have planned to build a direct line from Shacheng on the Ping-Sui Railway to Fengtai and extend the Ping-Jin Railway to Tanggu New Port. According to the pre-war national export, the total amount was only 1 billion national currency, which at that time was only about 300 million US dollars. If Datong coal can be sold well abroad, the foreign trade situation will be greatly changed.</p>

<h3>Consultations on General Election Nominations; Proportional Issues Unresolved</h3>
<p>According to a key member of the Democratic Socialist Party who participated in the consultations on general election nominations: when representatives of the three parties consulted on September 25th, the Democratic Socialist Party suggested that the three parties submit their candidate lists for each province, add them together and make a decision, but the government representatives stated that the list had not yet been drafted, and the candidate list for Jiangsu Province could not be submitted. They hoped that the two parties would submit the list first. At that time, the representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party did not agree, and then advocated that the list could not be submitted until the "proportion" was agreed upon. Thus, a stalemate was formed and has not been resolved. It is reported that the quota of candidates for the Democratic Socialist Party is 100 for members of the Legislative Yuan and 400 for members of the National Assembly. The Youth Party has approximately 150 members of the Legislative Yuan and 600 members of the National Assembly. The government only promises to assist the two parties in participating in the general election in terms of morality, but is unwilling to guarantee the results of the election.</p>

<h3>Speech by Sims-Worth, Hong Kong Government Director of Imports and Exports; Exposes Smuggling Methods and Routes</h3>
<p>Sims-Worth, Director of Imports and Exports of the Hong Kong Government, said in a speech at the Hong Kong-British Economic Association that the most common method of smuggling is to pack all embargoed goods into small packages, carry them on board several times, and hide them in various parts of the ship. After the ship sails, all the packages are gathered together. After arriving at the destination, they are taken out through customs with or without the tacit permission of customs officers. He denounced the saying that smuggling is carried out at night on deserted beaches as absurd. According to him, most of the smuggling is found on ships sailing on designated routes. These ships directly enter the port of Hong Kong, or are found on planes flying to the airport in Kowloon, or on trains to Kowloon. Mr. Sims-Worth criticized the statement that "Hong Kong does not cooperate in prohibiting smuggling" as unfair. He pointed out that since the beginning of this year, the Hong Kong courts have ruled on more than 500 such cases, in which the value of the contraband confiscated exceeds HK$1.5 million. He declared: "The solution to smuggling depends on merchants having a sense of political morality and being able to abide by export ban regulations. In short, only by lifting trade restrictions and higher tariffs can smuggling be completely eliminated. We only hope that all countries understand that the loss of tax revenue, the shrinking of trade, and the organized resistance to laws will produce results that are not worth the losses."</p>
<h3>Non-Permanent Members of the Security Council: Canada and Argentina Elected; One Seat Remaining After Nine Inconclusive Ballots</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 1st Radio: Lake Success News, today the UN General Assembly continued to elect non-permanent members of the Security Council. In the morning's eight rounds of voting, Ukraine received 31 votes, a decrease of two votes compared to yesterday. India received 23 votes, still failing to confirm its election.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Approximately the 1st Radio: The General Assembly held its ninth vote, resulting in 32 votes for Ukraine and 24 votes for India, each gaining one vote from the eighth round, but still short of the 38-vote legal requirement.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 30th Combined Telegram] The United States is attempting to eliminate pro-Soviet countries from the Security Council, causing the General Assembly to be deadlocked during voting. This has further deteriorated US-Soviet relations. Poland, originally a pro-Soviet non-permanent member of the Security Council, has now completed its term, and the election of its successor has reached an impasse. The Soviet Union supports Ukraine, while the United States supports India. After seven ballots, neither side could obtain a two-thirds majority, and the vote was postponed. According to UN practice, Poland should be succeeded by another Slavic country. The Soviet Union protested, saying that removing Slavic countries from the Security Council would undermine the UN Charter. During the voting, only Poland, among the Security Council member states, voted in favor of a country sympathetic to the Soviet Union succeeding as the new member. From the first vote of the General Assembly, Ukraine received more votes than India. By the seventh vote, Ukraine had 33 votes and India had 23 votes. Former General Assembly President Spaak suggested adjournment, but Vyshinsky shouted against stopping the voting. However, the General Assembly ultimately passed a motion with 28 votes to 16 to postpone the vote until the 1st.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 30th Telegram] Since its various committees began working at Lake Success, the UN General Assembly held its first plenary session here today, officially allowing the two Asian Muslim countries, Pakistan and Yemen, to join the organization. However, it was completely deadlocked in electing a country between Ukraine and India to replace Poland's vacancy on the Security Council. Today was one of the most unstable days since the establishment of the new world organization. After smoothly electing Argentina to succeed Brazil and Canada to succeed Australia as members of the Security Council, it failed to resolve the problem of Ukraine and India. Today's meeting demonstrated the effect of so-called bloc voting. The United States and the Soviet Union played a leading role in today's difficulties. Today's situation reflects the great rift between the two countries and clearly shows how small, united countries can fish in troubled waters. Due to difficulties in the Security Council election, the elections for six members of the Economic and Social Council and two members of the Trusteeship Council, originally scheduled for today, could not be held.</p>
<h3>UN Organization Membership Increased to 57 Countries; Mrs. Pandit Delivers Speech Welcoming Sister Nations</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, Flushing Meadow, 30th] The Kingdom of Pakistan and Yemen officially joined the United Nations as members today.

After the Assembly passed the applications of the two countries, their chief representatives were invited to the podium to sign the membership certificates.

<p>[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, 30th] Indian representative Mrs. Pandit today delivered a congratulatory speech at the UN General Assembly welcoming Pakistan's participation in the United Nations, stating that India's sister nation has obtained its legitimate position in the international community and can cooperate in solving the current world's problems, which makes India deeply gratified.</p>

<h3>US President's Expedient Aid to Europe Plan; Taft Ridicules as Unwise; Firmly Opposed to Convening a Special Session of Congress</h3>
<p>[United Press, Boise City, 30th] Senator Taft stated on the 30th that although Truman had issued a warning that the current European relief funds would be exhausted by December 1st, he still opposed convening a special session of Congress before December 1st. Taft believes that the majority of Republican senators have reiterated their previous position against convening a special session at this time. However, he believes that "some foolish people in the government" will be willing to dip into their pockets to provide a large amount of money for expedient aid to Europe.</p>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 30th] The chairmen of the major congressional committees today quickly responded to President Truman's request to expedite the study of Western Europe's winter relief needs.

<h3>On the Eve of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference; Soviet Union Sends Note to Italian Government Explaining Its Attitude Towards Italian Colonies</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] London, 1st Radio: Rome News, the Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman announced at a press conference that Soviet Ambassador to Italy Kostylev presented a note to Italian Foreign Minister Sforza today. It is said that the content of this document is "very important" and has a great relationship with improving Italian-Soviet relations. It is generally believed that the document explains the Soviet Union's attitude towards the disposal of pre-war Italian colonies, because this issue will soon be discussed by the four-power foreign ministers in London.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 30th] After the Soviet government agreed to convene a four-power foreign ministers' conference to discuss Italian colonies, the conference is expected to be convened in the second week of this month. Its first task will be to send a committee of experts to the Middle East to inspect the former Italian colonies of Tripolitania, Cyrenaica, Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland. General attention is focused on the Soviet Union's attitude, because at the first foreign ministers' conference in London two years ago, the Soviet Union requested trusteeship of Tripolitania. Although it has not raised the matter again since then, it is possible that it will be raised again at this conference.</p>

<h3>Bidault Meets Truman; France Deeply Fears Aid Will Not Arrive in Time; Britain Concerned About Occupation Cost Negotiations in the British-American Zone of Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 1st] French Foreign Minister Bidault, who is currently in the United States, is scheduled to meet President Truman today. The French government and people attach great importance to the outcome of this meeting, because the US dollars that France can use to pay for necessary imports can at most last for only two or three weeks. The President's announcement yesterday that he intended to submit a transitional aid plan to Congress for a decision disappointed people here, who are worried that American aid will not be allocated in time to prevent the rapid deterioration of the economic situation.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Authoritative sources say: British officials do not feel dissatisfied or angry about President Truman's failure to include Britain in the list of transitional aid plans. Britain's economic recovery plan does not fully take into account American financial aid, including the Marshall Aid plan. However, although Britain is struggling to survive on its own resources, it does not mean that Germany will also rely on British resources to survive, so the negotiations on the occupation costs of the British-American zone of Germany, which will be held in Washington next week, have a significant impact on Britain's American dollar budget.</p>
<h3>Batavia Consular Corps Extends Report Deadline</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 1st Radio: Batavia News, the UN Consular Investigation Team's final report on the situation in Indonesia, originally scheduled to be submitted to the Security Council this Thursday, was postponed for two weeks because American military observers arrived in Batavia and insisted on going to the war zone to conduct on-site inspections again.

<h3>Soviet Union Refuses to Allow US Dollars to Enter</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] Republican Senator Bricker stated today that the Soviet Union did not allow the US Senate Finance Committee delegation to enter the country to visit the American Embassy. When the delegation was inspecting in Europe, it requested the Soviet Union to issue passports, specifically stating that the purpose of the trip was to investigate the situation of the US Embassy in the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Foreign Ministry replied that "since the Soviet Union has not been recognized as the target of investigation by visiting foreign senators, we do not consider such an act appropriate."

<h3>Japanese Cotton Textiles Have Occupied the Southeast Asian Market; Over 50 Million Yards Shipped Last Month</h3>

<h3>Chairman of the Allied Council for Japan Requests Raising Japanese Industrial Standards; Believes Increased Population Necessitates Increased Volume</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] The Allied Council for Japan held its 42nd meeting on the 1st, at which Chairman and US Representative Sebald reported on the current state of Japanese industrial production. The main points are as follows: The production index has gradually increased from the lowest point in the autumn of 1945, and has now recovered to 45% of the average base from 1930 to 1934. The population has increased by 20%, so the level in these five years is an underestimate of the current peacetime needs. The wartime peak production index was approximately twice that of 1934. The main obstacle to production is the shortage of coal. Coal production has recently averaged 2.2 million tons per month, while the average minimum peacetime demand is over 3 million tons per month. Steel production has recently recovered to 90,000 tons of steel ingots per month from zero when Japan surrendered, which is one-third of the minimum demand. The fiber industry is the central hub of the Japanese economy. Silk production is more than double that of the early part of 1946, but it is only one-sixth of the 1930 level. There is great hope for the necessary raw material imports in the coming year. The recovery of Japanese industrial production can only be achieved after the conclusion of a peace treaty and the resumption of peacetime trade. Japanese industrial production must exceed the level of 1930 to 1934.</p>
<h3>Japanese Actually Want to Recover Ryukyu; Senate Once Discussed It</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] The Japanese Senate Foreign Affairs Committee listened to a petition this afternoon requesting the return of the Ryukyu Islands to Japan. The committee was divided on whether the parliament should select one of the requested islands, with half in favor and half against. Therefore, further discussion of this issue was postponed until the committee's next meeting.

<h3>Truman Sincerely Appeals for National Food Conservation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 1st Radio: Washington News, the newly established US Citizens' Food Committee held its first meeting today. President Truman attended in person to deliver a speech, in which he said: The United States must suppress prices and conserve food waste in order to help the hungry people abroad. In order to relieve the food panic that Europe will face this winter, the United States must save 100 million bushels of grain. If the American people can all understand the urgent need for relief in other countries and unanimously implement conservation, then the amount to be saved by each person is actually very small. In the coming months, if every American can save one bushel of grain, the entire relief plan can be realized. According to general estimates, 10% of the daily food purchased by the American people is wasted, and this phenomenon must be corrected. In addition, domestic prices must be suppressed, otherwise it will lower the living standards of the American people and cause the current prosperity to disappear.</p>

<h3>City General Labor Union Emergency Meeting; Discusses Reasons for Particularly Low Index; Demands Supplementary Coal Balls and Cooking Oil Compensation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the City General Labor Union, convened an emergency joint meeting of temporary directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon to discuss the reasons for the particularly low cost of living index in September: It was believed that when compiling the index, prices were surveyed once every Wednesday. There were only four Wednesdays in a month, and the prices on each Wednesday in the past month were relatively stable, which was inevitably inaccurate. Rice, coal balls, and cooking oil, all important daily necessities, are calculated using official ration prices, which has a significant impact on the index, but workers have not yet received coal balls and cooking oil. Resolution: The entire standing committee of the General Labor Union, together with five representatives including Sun Jinghu, Lin Chunting, Yao Ligen, Weng Shanhe, and Ni Xuanqing, will visit Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 AM on the 3rd to request supplementary distribution of coal balls, cooking oil, and other rationed items to compensate for the losses in the cost of living index. As for how to improve the compilation of the cost of living index, the General Labor Union will hire experts to study and advise the municipal government, so that the cost of living index is not too far from actual prices. Regarding the communist bandits' incitement of labor unrest in the city, the authorities have arrested them separately. The General Labor Union will publish a letter to all workers in the city, hoping that all workers in the city will be secure in their current jobs. The General Labor Union will protect good workers. If there are any requests or opinions, they must be submitted through legal procedures. Do not lightly believe in rumors and act rashly.</p>

<h3>A Trip to Haiyan</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, September 29th Dispatch] Crossing mountains and Hangzhou, on the way to Haiyan, this is approaching</p>
<p>the edge of the seawall.</p>
<p>The reporter has been here many times and has even had a car accident and been injured. Strangely, this time the road is so flat. The driver who came with me also said this is the best road since the war. Arriving at the edge of Haiyan city, we made a special trip to the Tide Watching Pavilion in Haiyan for a patrol. Outside the stone embankment, there was a stretch of yellow sand. The magnificent sight of the tide like ten thousand horses galloping in the past cannot be seen outside Haiyan city anymore. I also thought of the desolate scene in Haiyan city that I couldn't bear to see again, but Mr. Tian insisted that I accompany him to see it. As soon as we arrived in the city, it was still ruins and rubble. The Haiyan county government doesn't seem to know what it's planning to do. The provincial government and the special commissioner have repeatedly ordered the restoration of governance, but there is still no sign of it. Then from</p>
<p>Haiyan to Haiyan Salt Fields</p>
<p>Along the way, engineers and masters constantly got out of the car to ask the road maintenance team and check the bridges. They were really busy. I heard that each worker in the road maintenance team only receives 240,000 yuan in salary per month, and food alone costs 200,000 yuan. Most of these road maintenance workers came here to avoid military service due to the draft. Some people even brought money from home. As we traveled, it suddenly started to rain. The engineers worked in the rain. They asked this and that for the safety of the passengers, which was really touching. The car slid past the sea. The road was a little bumpy. Mr. Xu Huijun told the reporter that this section of the road still needs to be repaired. Along the way, looking at the sea on the right, we also saw the salt fields by the sea. Mr. Tian was here for the first time and was very interested. That night, we stayed at the Haifeng Hotel in Zhapu, which is famous in Jiangnan for its guerrilla warfare, opened by</p>
<p>Double Gun Eighth Sister</p>
<p>It is said that Ms. Wang also has a hotel in Huangshan. Mr. Tian was inspired by poetry and recited many poems and lyrics. The next day, the reporter and Mr. Tian went for a walk on the street. Most of the shops here sell salted dried goods, and there is also fresh jellyfish for sale. We walked to the seaside and saw the seagoing ships with their high bows and sterns, and the endless sea, singing loudly. The strong ocean atmosphere made us children who grew up in the plains and rural areas feel happy.</p>
<p>We walked to the end of Zhapu town and saw a</p>
<p>broken bunker.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, it looked like we had arrived at the battlefield of the Zhili-Anhui War. The large stone slabs were destroyed and scattered in disarray. This bunker had three cannons facing the sea, but the gun carriages of two of the iron cannons were gone, and their bodies were covered in thick rust. One cannon was relatively intact, but it was also heavily rusted. The cannons did not have ammunition transport tunnels, so the shells probably had to be loaded from the muzzle. There were no sights either. These three cannons were products of the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau in the year Jia Shen of Guangxu (1884). We felt that such things should be well preserved abroad. But we tolerate their abandonment, which is a real pity. We also looked at several mountain peaks in the distance, all of which had gun emplacements and military works. But if they are also abandoned like this bunker, then what else can we say?</p>
<p>Zhapu and Ganpu</p>
<p>The area between the two can be said to be the best harbor. The vast expanse of seawater is really pleasing. Then we went to Huangshan, which is also a summer resort in summer. Many foreigners come here. It is said that at that time, the cars on the road were simply lined up one after another, which shows the grandeur of the scene. Most of the houses on the mountain are simple, and the facilities are not very good. At the foot of the mountain, there is a river, and some grass sheds are built on the river. It is said that this is a simple seawater bathing place, and the grass sheds are changing rooms. Facing Huangshan, there are three small islands. The one on the left is lush with trees. Huangshan and these three small islands can be developed to attract many tourists.</p>
<p>We then drove forward, which was a section of highway still under construction. The machines were running non-stop. When we arrived at Jin Sinianling, Director Liang and Mr. Tian wanted to go to Shanghai, so they let the reporter and Director Xu return to Hangzhou. Before leaving, they all told the reporter that by the end of September, that is, the time to watch the tide, this road could be safely open to traffic.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Bay, with its rich scenery, is indeed a place worth developing. Now the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau wants to make Hangzhou Bay navigable, which has taken a step forward in realizing the ideal of developing Hangzhou Bay. (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)</p>
<h3>Naming Incidents in Hong Kong: A stall vendor dares to name himself Wang Yunwu; A bold prostitute jokes with the judge.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hong Kong, 28th Dispatch] A young man picked up a bottle of nitric acid and splashed it on the face of a female tour guide, and as a result, he was taken to court. When the judge asked his name, he replied, "Zhang Yuxiang!" There is a small stall in Wan Chai Steele Road, with a white cloth and black characters, which says: "Wang Yunwu sharpens razors and scissors."</p>
<p>Hong Kong people do not know whether it is out of curiosity or to join in the fun, recently they have "stolen" the names of famous people in the mainland. Some prostitutes who were arrested by the police and fined for "obstructing the street" were even more blatant in joking with the judge. One prostitute was arrested three times in a month. The first time she called herself "Yuan Wang Xia" (Wronged Xia), the second time she called herself "Duo Luo Xia" (Fallen Xia), and the third time she called herself "Zhe Jie Xia" (Broken Xia). The translator translated them into English as usual, and the judge listened and recorded them as usual. As a result, the bold prostitute deceived them! However, not every case is so confused.</p>
<p>A few days ago, General Huang Qiang's son ran over a woman in Kowloon while driving. The newspaper reported that he was General Huang Guangshuo's son. The latter was innocent and suffered for nothing, so the newspaper published a correction.</p>
<h3>Banquet for Zhang Fakui, Cen Weixiu Accompanying</h3>
<p>A few days ago, Guangzhou Executive Yuan Director General Zhang Fakui came to Hong Kong to report for duty. At the welcome banquet hosted by the Chinese and Western Chamber of Commerce, according to a Hong Kong Chinese newspaper, "Cen Weixiu of the Overseas Chinese Daily was invited to accompany him." General Zhang once issued an order to arrest Cen Weixiu last year. This arrest warrant has not yet been publicly revoked. How did a "prisoner" become a "guest of honor"! Although it is said that the "Cen Weixiu" at the banquet and the "Cen Weixiu" in the arrest warrant are two different people, is it the same person? This has to be said to be a special manifestation of the recent "naming incidents" in Hong Kong, but this joke seems to be getting bigger and bigger! (Special Correspondent Zijian)</p>
<h3>Construction Fund of 600 Million Allocated to Nanchang Municipal Government, Designated for Transportation, Education, etc.</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanchang, September 26th Dispatch] The central government approved a construction fund of 600 million yuan for Jiangxi this year. Governor Wang Lingji now believes that if the funds are distributed to various counties, the amount obtained will be very small and will not help. Therefore, he decided to use the funds in a centralized manner and allocated them to the Nanchang Municipal Government as a construction fund for building Nanchang into a model city, and designated them for transportation, education, and public health. The municipal government now plans to use 200 million yuan for repairing the five main roads such as Xiangshan and Fushan, 200 million yuan for repairing primary schools in the urban area, and another 200 million yuan for building the city's main sewers and public toilets. However, it is heard that the funds allocated by the central government will be distributed in installments from this month to September next year.</p>
<h3>Monks of Tianchi Temple in Lushan Discover Iron Tiles</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanchang, September 28th Dispatch] Tianchi Temple in Lushan was built during the Jiading period of the Song Dynasty, destroyed by war in the Yuan Dynasty, and rebuilt in the sixth year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty. It was covered with iron tiles and赐 with a bronze bell, elephant skin drum, and Wujin Prince statue, more than six inches long. There were two large Buddhas and many small Buddhas inside, all cast in copper. Later, it was destroyed by fire, and the iron tiles and bronze bell were mostly buried and disappeared. Recently, the monks of the temple discovered several iron tiles while digging in the soil. According to general research, they are indeed antiques from the Ming Dynasty and are now treasured in the temple. This summer, when President Jiang was stationed in Guling, he visited the temple and, together with his wife, examined the posthumous portrait of Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty and the iron tiles, and gained a lot of knowledge. According to the monks, the original Wujin Prince and other objects are now gone. Even these iron tiles can be regarded as treasures.</p>
<h3>The Draft Law is Disregarded: Township Chiefs Arbitrarily Deduct and Coerce; Magistrate of Jiangyin Ordered to Thoroughly Investigate the Truth</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jiangyin, September 29th Dispatch] Cai Runqi, commander of the Wuxi Garrison District, said that when he held individual talks with the 43 new recruits from the first company of new recruits and company commander Yang Yixin, eight people, including Cheng Hantang from Shanzheng Township, complained that they were not volunteers or draftees. Because they could not afford the family settlement fee, they were forced into the army by the township chief, and the amount of family settlement fee they received was too different from the amount of 10 million per person. Liu Qingzhi only received 600,000, Cheng Motang received eight dou of rice, Wang Jiuhang received 600,000, Teng Dan'guan received 600,000, Zhang Jinrong received 200,000, Li Rulin received eight dou of rice, Lu Wu'gao of Xieqiao received 1.02 million, and Hong Xing received 1.11 million yuan. Company Commander Yang believed that the matter concerned military service laws, so he wrote a simple confession record and submitted it to Commander Cai. Commander Cai specially telegraphed Magistrate Xu to thoroughly investigate the truth. Magistrate Xu has been ordered to check the roster of draftees and summon the township chiefs to the case for investigation.</p>
<h3>Pinghu County Grain Bureau Strictly Prohibits Advance Purchase and Sale of Rice Seedlings</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Pinghu, September 30th Dispatch] The county grain bureau believes that the advance purchase and sale of rice seedlings not only exploits farmers but is also tantamount to gambling, and strictly prohibits it.

<h3>Haiyan Osmanthus Tide</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, October 1st Dispatch] The Mid-Autumn Festival has passed, and the Zhejiang tide has reached its peak. Recently, many Chinese and foreigners have gone to Haiyan to see the osmanthus tide. Hotels in Hangzhou are fully booked. August 18th of the lunar calendar is the highest tide, and the grand occasion of watching the tide will surpass next year, because the river flow has changed direction and the tide head has become smaller. It is expected that there will be no tide to see next year.</p>
<h3>Gaochun Election Office Established</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Gaochun, September 28th Dispatch] The Gaochun Election Office has been established, with County Magistrate Zhang Ding concurrently serving as the chairman of the committee.

<h3>Guangzhou Bans Dancing: No Problems in Implementation; No Impact on Tax Revenue; Austerity Should Start with Diet</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, September 27th Dispatch] The ban on dancing in Guangzhou has not caused a big reaction. There are more than ten dance halls here, with a total of one or two thousand dancers and employees. The Social Affairs Bureau said that the city's decision to ban dancing will be implemented from October 1st. If the measures promulgated by the central government have not been received, a temporary single law for implementation will first be drafted to ensure that commercial dancing is completely banned from October 1st. However, the dancers do not seem to have any opinions, and there is no sign that they are preparing to petition the municipal government. This is not because they have a law-abiding spirit, but because they all have their own ways. The dance hall owners have long been prepared to organize</p>
<p>black market dance halls</p>
<p>using the name of a social club or an alumni association to take advantage of the opportunity to open dance parties that are nominally non-commercial but actually commercial. Business can be done as usual, and taxes can be exempted. This is of course the best wishful thinking. For the dancers, there is even less of a problem. Those who have a way have successively transferred to Hong Kong and Macau to implement expansion in other places. Earning Hong Kong dollars is of course several times better than earning national currency! Even if they stay here temporarily, they can also switch to singing or working as waitresses in restaurants, and their income will not be less. Although some people predict that the number of private prostitutes will definitely increase after the ban on dancing, this is a matter for later. In short, the implementation of the ban on dancing in Guangzhou is absolutely no problem, and the people in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau have also said so.</p>
<p>Will the dance ban have an impact on municipal tax revenue? The authorities replied: "Absolutely no impact." This is indeed an honest statement, because municipal taxes</p>
<p>monthly income</p>
<p>the largest of which, taking August as an example, in addition to business tax, is slaughter tax and banquet tax. The slaughter tax revenue totaled more than 640 million yuan, and the banquet tax was more than 410 million yuan. Although the total amount of entertainment tax was more than 450 million yuan, this includes theaters, cinemas, and other entertainment taxes. The amount of revenue from dance halls is actually a very small number. Therefore, it is absolutely credible to say that there is no impact on tax revenue. However, another problem arises here: is the ban on dancing really able to fulfill the task of austerity? This is really questionable in Guangzhou. We can see from the tax revenue figures listed above that the consumption of Guangzhou people in dance halls is probably limited, while consumption on food is a huge number. The number of large teahouses and restaurants in Guangzhou is the highest among other cities in the country. This can be used as a new explanation for "Eating in Guangzhou." Moreover, every large restaurant must have</p>
<p>beautifully dressed</p>
<p>waitresses. The success or failure of a restaurant depends on whether the waitresses are beautiful and whether they can cater to customers. It can be seen that some people do not necessarily go to restaurants for food. The so-called "the old drunkard's intention is not in the wine," and their consumption in restaurants is actually dozens of times more than in dance halls. Therefore, if we want to vigorously implement austerity in Guangzhou, we still have to think about ways to do it in terms of diet in order to achieve practical results.

<h3>Embezzlement Case on Yuehan Railway: 80 Tons of Cotton Yarn Smuggled: 300 Million Yuan in Handling Fees Illegally Collected: Principal Offender Li Wentao to be Prosecuted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changsha, October 1st Dispatch] The embezzlement case on the Yuehan Railway in Changsha has been investigated and found that the accommodation of packages from Hunan merchants is still limited. The reason for the accusations from all parties is the smuggling of cotton yarn transported by Kong Xiangxiao of the Transportation Section. Kong was allocated a large batch of cotton yarn in Shanghai to aid the raw materials of the yarn mills in South China. In November, 880 tons were transported from Shanghai to Wuhan. Under the difficulty of waiting for thousands of tons of goods to be transported south, thanks to the power of wealthy capital, one carriage was dispatched daily from early June, totaling 17 carriages (capacity 40 tons). All of them arrived in Changsha in late June. Unexpectedly, when transferring from Changsha to Guangzhou, the railway bureau doubled the freight rate. After the Kong family specially dispatched personnel to mediate, all 680 tons of goods were calculated at the freight rate before the price increase. However, the actual Kong family's agent gave the station a handling fee that exceeded the freight rate. Therefore, the amount of embezzlement was more than 3 billion. Li Wenqing, the head of the Transportation Section, the principal offender, has confessed after being interrogated several times by the Changsha District Court Procuratorate and will soon be prosecuted.</p>

<p>Yarn Prices Rebound: Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw many buyers taking advantage of the low prices, while manufacturers were unwilling to sell easily. As a result, closing prices generally rose. After measuring, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rebounded by 450,000 yuan from the previous day to 25.65 million yuan. 20-count Special Double Horse rose by 200,000 yuan, and Light Change Horse rose by 500,000 yuan. 16-count and 10-count coarse yarns were selling more quickly, with prices remaining stable. Most other brands of coarse and fine yarns saw more gains than losses.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Slightly Rises:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially saw continued price declines due to tight credit, leading to more selling to settle accounts. Fine Longtou cloth briefly fell to 615,000 yuan. Subsequently, with absorption from dyeing factories and buyers, Fine Longtou cloth recovered to 639,000 yuan, a rise of 19,000 yuan from the previous day. Five Fortunes Blue Chicken Colored Ball and other cloths also rose by 5,000 to 23,000 yuan. Serge Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance and Four Gentlemen were in high demand, rising by 10,000 to 23,000 yuan. Bleached cloth declined, while Shilin coarse cloth and printed cloth remained strong.</p>
<p>Cotton Weakens:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market remained weak. Tight credit among industry players dampened enthusiasm for buying, leading to a soft trend. Increased selling to settle accounts caused prices to decline further slightly, and trading was sparse. Total daily transactions amounted to over 700 bales and another 1,000 dan. Factory prices opened at 2.8 million for Fire Machine, and 2.85 million for Fu Taicang, with 1,000 dan changing hands. Stacking prices were 3.3 million for Lingbin, and credit prices were 3.35 million and 3.39 million. Han fine cotton was 3.18 million, and Shashi cotton was 3.18 million and 3.2 million, with over 700 bales traded. Zhoupu seed cotton was 500,000.</p>
<h3>Export Tea Trading Sparse</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market saw continued inquiries from local merchants and buyers for various domestic teas, keeping the market relatively active and prices stable. As for export tea varieties, sellers had intentions to raise prices, but buyers were hesitant due to unfavorable prices in foreign markets. Therefore, they were unwilling to buy at high prices, resulting in limited trading and a stagnant trend at market close.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw prices weaken due to transportation disruptions from the north, leading to sluggish sales. The guild's assessment for spot goods was just over 20,000 yuan for medium white sugar, ranging from 790,000 to 795,000 yuan. Combined red sugar was 800,000 yuan, and four-and-a-half white sugar was 880,000 to 945,000 yuan. Shantou tea remained stable, ranging from 690,000 to 695,000 yuan, and cotton red sugar was 727,000 to 725,000 yuan, totaling over 100 bales. Xinghua white sugar was a little over 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, ranging from 770,000 to 780,000 yuan. Barrel packaging ranged from 700,000 to 750,000 yuan. Xing red sugar was a little over 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, ranging from 660,000 to 670,000 yuan, totaling around 400 pieces. Diao Qing was quoted at a little over 10,000 yuan, but no transaction occurred.</p>
<p>Hardware Prices Soar:</p>
<p>Nails are jumping again and again. Sandpaper has doubled in price in two weeks. Items such as varnish, hinges, leather belt buckles, and Three Stars steel saw blades are rising without limit daily. The increase in foreign exchange rates and smooth sales are the biggest reasons for the price surge.</p>
<h3>Bank Clearings Ease Credit</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, state-owned banks cleared out 148 billion yuan at the clearing house, easing credit conditions. However, the implicit interest rate remained at 2.2 cents, and many outside the Chinese stock market were paying 3 cents in interest. In the detailed clearing figures, the Central Bank cleared out 100 million yuan, agencies cleared in 35.3 billion yuan, foreign banks cleared in 15.1 billion yuan, agencies cleared out 35.6 billion yuan, and other banks included the Bank of China clearing out 2.3 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications clearing out 19.5 billion yuan, the Agricultural Bank of China clearing in 4.7 billion yuan, the China Trust clearing in 2.6 billion yuan, the Postal Remittances clearing out 6.3 billion yuan, and the Cooperative Treasury clearing in 6.2 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Import Tax on Fuel Oil: All Increased by 50% Ad Valorem</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Jianghai Customs announced yesterday that the import tax on gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil has been uniformly increased to 50% ad valorem. Crude oil is temporarily exempt from import tax. Item 529 of the Import Tariff is amended as follows: A.

The new regulations will take effect from October 1st of this year. In other news, Jianghai Customs will be closed for one day on Double Tenth National Day.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Approves Bank Closure and Liquidation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Regarding bank closures and liquidations, the Ministry of Finance previously formulated eight points for attention. It is now learned that the Executive Yuan has instructed the Ministry of Finance to revise the "Points for Attention" into "Measures for Bank Closure and Liquidation," with slight revisions to the articles. The measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: When a bank is closed and liquidated, it shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of these measures, in addition to the company's handling procedures.</p>
<p>Article 2: The liquidator of a bank, whether determined by the shareholders' resolution or elected by the shareholders' meeting, shall be a legally practicing certified public accountant. If a shareholder or director serves as the liquidator, a certified public accountant shall also be selected to serve as a liquidator. The liquidators listed in the preceding two paragraphs shall report the date of their assumption of office to the court and the Ministry of Finance for record within the prescribed time limit.</p>
<p>Article 3: If a liquidator cannot be selected in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article, the Ministry of Finance may petition the court to appoint a liquidator.</p>
<p>Article 4: After the assets of the bank have been valued by the certified public accountant performing the liquidation, the valuation shall be reported to the court and the Ministry of Finance for record.</p>
<p>Article 5: The liquidator shall open a special account in the Central Bank of China in Fudi for the cash held in the bank's vault, the various receivables recovered, the funds transferred from interbank accounts, and the value of the property, and deposit them at any time for withdrawal and payment of liabilities. The check for withdrawal must be signed by the accountant serving as the liquidator.</p>
<p>Article 6: The liquidator shall, as soon as possible, completely repay all the deposits and remittances received by the bank within three months from the date of liquidation. If there are still disputes over a certain claim, debt, or property, the deposits and remittances shall still be given priority from the funds stored in the special account.</p>
<p>Article 7: The liquidator shall report the liquidation status to the Ministry of Finance for verification on a monthly basis, and shall submit relevant forms and other documents before the fifth day of the following month.</p>
<p>Article 8: The bank shall report to the Ministry of Finance for record upon the completion of the liquidation or the declaration of bankruptcy in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Article 9: These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3>Reader's Mailbox: A University Student's Plight After a Breakup - The Woman Abandons Their Old Love Due to Parental Opposition</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: Enduring extremely negative emotions, I am writing this letter to you. I don't know if I should be doing this, but I have done it anyway, and I am very sorry. The facts of the matter are as follows: Last summer, I came from the distant Northeast to Shanghai, the largest metropolis in the country. I spent a great deal of effort to enter a national university and began my university life. Two months after entering school, I met a female classmate. In terms of academics, character, and manners, she met the standards of my ideal partner. We attended classes, experiments, and games together every day, and our friendship deepened day by day. Of course, a pair of young men and women in their youth are easily drawn into the whirlpool of love if they have shared interests. Naturally, we were no exception. Gradually, friendship turned into love, and we swore to each other that we would be able to grow old together.</p>
<p>This summer, I returned to the North during the summer vacation, and she also returned to her home in Sichuan. Things often change unexpectedly. I can't believe that in the short span of two months, our love would suffer such a serious blow. At the end of the summer vacation, I returned to Shanghai, and she sent me a letter from Sichuan, the gist of which was that her parents opposed our marriage. She said that our previous agreement was no longer possible to fulfill! I don't believe that a sane woman would so easily bow down to old traditions. I don't believe that a woman who once loved me would say such a thing to me. After receiving her letter, my spirit suffered a great blow. I felt that life was empty, and I became pessimistic about everything. Now she has come to Shanghai, and we are still classmates, but her attitude towards me has completely changed. She rarely talks to me and always tries to avoid me.</p>
<p>Sir, you must be able to imagine how I have been living these days? My academic performance has declined significantly, and I often use alcohol and tobacco to numb myself. Although I know it is harmful to me, I cannot extricate myself! Today I am writing this letter to you, hoping that you can give me some guidance so that I can find some meaning in life. Sincerely wishing you well, Xu Yi respectfully.</p>

<h3>A Brief History of Chinese Buddhism</h3>
<p>— Lin Ye</p>
<p>(Compiled by释印顺 and 妙钦, published by大法轮画局, 36th year of the Republic, price 6,000 yuan)</p>
<p>"China's problem today is the problem of overall cultural renewal. In this overall renewal, the renewal of religious thought and religious life, I think, is the most fundamental and far-reaching work. ... If religious renewal is a necessary task in the rebirth of Chinese culture, then the Buddhist—the mainstream of Chinese religious tradition—reform movement is undoubtedly worthy of warm welcome and support from enlightened people in society."</p>
<p>—From Mr. Lin Tongji's preface to the book</p>
<p>This is a thin "Brief History of Buddhism" (only eighty or ninety pages), not a grand and extraordinary work. But it has its own unique characteristics, so it is still worth introducing here.</p>
<p>Studying Chinese Buddhist history is different from studying general history: First, one must be able to fully recognize the history of Buddhism's transmission and evolution in India. Second, one must have a fairly deep understanding of all of Shakyamuni's teachings. This should be an obvious fact.</p>
<p>The author of this book, Dharma Master Yinshun, has achieved great success in the study of Indian Buddhism. Those who have read "Indian Buddhism" and "In Search of the Source of Consciousness-Only Studies" will know this, so there is no need to elaborate here. I would like to quote a paragraph from the preface to "In Search of the Source of Consciousness-Only Studies" to show the close relationship between Chinese and Indian Buddhism and the author's historical perspective:</p>
<p>"In the development of Indian Mahayana Buddhism, there are two major schools of idealism: the True Mind School and the False Mind School. When they were transmitted to China, they became the Three Schools of the Treatise on the Land, the Treatise on the Compendium, and the Treatise on Consciousness-Only. These two major schools, the True Mind School, developed from the Mahasamghika-Ekavyavaharikas of eastern India; the False Mind School came from the Sarvastivada of western India... The classics of the East are always the pioneers of the times. The teachers of the West received the inspiration of their ideas, gave them rigorous speculation, and somewhat modified them. This kind of Eastern and Western Indian style is different; not only in the third period of idealism Buddhism, but also in the first two periods of Buddhism, there are such situations."</p>
<p>In this book, the characteristics of this "regional culture" are described in more detail. We only need to look at the titles of the four chapters in its eight chapters of the main text, which emphatically show spatiality, to understand. The table of contents of the whole book is as follows: Introduction, The Introduction of Buddhism to China; The Great Way Travels South; Southern Dynasty Buddhism, Sailing Smoothly; The Establishment of Idealism; The Body of Buddhism in the Central Plains; The Growth of New Buddhism; North, South, West, East and China; Buddhism in Flat Flow and Ups and Downs; "Change" can be regarded as a conclusion of this book.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many places in the content that refer to the "close relationship between time and space." To name a few: "The Buddhism of the Southern Dynasty for hundreds of years has undergone four changes from north to south... The South takes Wonderful Being as the ultimate, but it runs parallel with True Emptiness and reverses the slow rise of idealism. It is very different from the theory of constant idealism in the North (pp. 25-26). Although the study of the South is based on True Constancy and Wonderful Being, it can actually integrate the academic traditions from the Jin Dynasty; its metaphysical thinking is profound, which is beyond the reach of Northern studies. However, in terms of the integration of words and deeds, the Guanzhong and Luoyang areas used to emphasize the management of things and meritorious service, and the Jiangdong area emphasized strictness and aloofness. Measuring Southern Dynasty Buddhism with this standard, it is rather lacking in substance. The people of the North are simple and honest, and metaphysical theory is not their strength. They are mostly engaged in the study of things and images, and in diligent practice: such as the stone carvings of Yungang in Datong and Longmen in Yique, Luoyang... The grandeur and solemnity of its architecture and sculpture cannot be compared to the Southern Dynasty. Southern Chan is centered on Hengyue in Hunan, Nanchang in Jiangxi, and Anji in Anhui. It either moves southeast and enters the mountainous areas of Fujian, Zhejiang, and northern Guangdong, or travels northwest, crosses the Yangtze River from Fengzhou, goes north to Jing, Li, and Nanyang, and transforms and practices in the He and Luo regions. Buddhism inherits the fate of unification, and the boundary between politics and the north and south is mutually exchanged. The Sui and Tang politics took the North to govern the South, while in academics, the North was Sinicized. In the past, the Five Barbarians rebelled when the Jin Dynasty declined, and Buddhism went south; now, with the decline of the Tang Dynasty, the Five Dynasties rebelled, and Buddhism went north. From then on, the center of Buddhism has always been in the South." Mr. He Changqun said: "The study of history must first determine the time and space relationship of historical events, and then the concept of historical evolution will be clear and free from vagueness." (Preface to the Chinese Historical Reference Atlas) It can fully prove that this view is correct.</p>
<p>The outline of the whole book is briefly described in the "Introduction":</p>
<p>Chinese Buddhism, which has been popular for nearly 1,900 years, can be said to have received from India: The Han, Wei, and Jin dynasties transmitted equivalent to the middle period of Buddhism in India; the Northern and Southern dynasties to the Northern Song transmitted equivalent to the later period of Buddhism in India. From the perspective of popularity in China, it can also be divided into two periods: "First, from the Han and Wei dynasties to the Sui and Tang dynasties, it was a period of receiving speculation (approximately biased towards saying). Translating and thinking about it, organizing it, its characteristic is to integrate and summarize. If it is obtained, it will be magnificent and magnificent, but if it is lost, it will be cumbersome and trivial, like a son of a noble family. The one who established the style of this generation is Shi Daoan of Xiangyang. Second, from the Li Tang dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, it was a period of continuing honest practice. That is, to practice and prove what you know, its characteristic is simplicity and practicality. If it is obtained, it will be simple and sincere, but if it is lost, it will be simple, crude, and poor, like a farmer. The one who established the style of this generation is the monk Yan Neng of Lingnan. The Buddhism of speculation and summarization was initially only a taste of "emptiness of nature"; then it differentiated into the "wonderful being of true emptiness" in the south and the "true constant idealism" in the north; to the extreme, it became the splendor of the Eight Schools of Mahayana. The Buddhism of honesty practice and simplicity initially inherited various schools and was hidden as two schools, namely the "wonderful being of true emptiness" of the Tiantai School and the "true constant idealism" of the Chan School; to the extreme, it became a mixture of Chan, Teaching, Discipline, and Pure Land" (pp. 1-2). Chinese Buddhism has a long history, and it is no longer just Buddhism that is popular in China, but it has become Buddhism that belongs to China.</p>
<p>In the current situation of extreme scarcity of books on the history of Buddhism, this book is well worth reading. However, it is not without merit; because this is a brief "historical outline," the author seems to be trying to save words, citing many "original texts" or ancient book "idioms." First, the source is not indicated, and second, the method of translating ancient Chinese into modern Chinese is not used - indicating "modern language"; this is inevitably inconvenient for beginners to read. If I am not mistaken, I hope that it can be considered and remedied in the future when it is re-printed! It will be more ideal than it is now.</p>
<h3>Pilgrimage on Foot - Bin Zhi</h3>
<p>— Written by Ye Qiuyuan</p>
<p>Published by the Shanghai Zhitian Translation Institute in Beiping</p>
<p>"Pilgrimage on Foot" is a work by Mr. Ye Qiuyuan recording his travels in Europe and the United States. In the summer of the 30th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Ye went abroad to investigate the cultural undertakings of Catholicism, passing through India, the United States, the British Isles, and Rome, circling the globe for over a year. At that time, the war was still raging, and there were scars of war everywhere, so what he saw and experienced was different from peacetime. Religious people have always advocated peace, and the cultural undertakings run by Catholicism in various places are spreading the seeds of peace, but how much they harvest is not very obvious on weekdays, but it is easier to know the effectiveness of them during the war.</p>
<p>This book adopts the style of travel notes, but Mr. Ye's trip was mainly to investigate the cultural undertakings of Catholicism, so what he paid attention to was naturally focused on this aspect. Therefore, what this book records is mainly about Catholicism, and the scenery and culture of various places are only the background of the church's activities. Originally, religion has a global nature, but the customs and habits of various places are different, and religious activities must also vary according to the environment of each place. Catholicism has spread to every corner of the world, and the cultural and publishing undertakings it runs have achieved remarkable results. This cannot but be attributed to the bishops and priests of Catholicism in various places who are good at using the local environment. The book speaks very detailed about this point.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into fifty-one sections, excluding the introduction. Four sections record the travel situation, two sections talk about the Catholic situation in India, twenty-one sections record the churches in various parts of the Americas, nineteen sections record the Catholic activities in the British Isles, and five sections talk about the pilgrimage in Rome. Mr. Ye likes to explore religious principles from a cultural point of view, so he traces the origin of everything he saw along the way that is related to the evolution of Catholicism. In the United States, he discovered the route of Catholicism's transmission from the Old Continent to the New Continent, and the process of its development in the Americas. In the United Kingdom, he traced the evolution of Catholicism in the British Isles. In India, although it is the birthplace of Buddhism, Catholicism also has many believers, and he pointed out the special undertakings of Eastern Catholicism. The Vatican in Rome is the holy land of Catholicism, and there are more relics there to promote the transcendence and holiness of Catholicism. Therefore, from this book, you can learn about the past evolution of Catholicism, the process of its transmission in various places, how to establish many great undertakings, and the relationship with the cultural development of various places.</p>
<p>This book is not only a book of travel notes, we can also regard it as "The History of the Spread of Catholicism" and read it as a department of cultural history. Catholicism has had a long history in China, and the churches in various places have done many sacred undertakings. We already know a little about the spread of Catholicism in China, but we are mostly isolated from the situation in other parts of the world. This book can be used to understand the cultural activities of Catholicism in various parts of the world in concise and easy-to-read words.</p>
<h3>"Talks on Domestic Science"</h3>
<p>— By Meng Kun, Translated by Song Yi, Author: Fabre</p>
<p>One of the Kai Ming Youth Series</p>
<p>Some scholars often become famous for the main subject they study, and the author of this book is an example. J.H. Fabre was a French entomologist and a popular science writer. He gained more fame from the latter than from the former. He has countless readers of all ages, from different languages and skin colors. Like Professor Hayden, his name is also familiar to us. Many of his pamphlets have long been translated and circulated among children and adults. He was the only scholar before Hayden who could instill common sense of popular science into people. He just wrote in a more popular, vivid, and understandable way, and it was easier to accept and more relevant to daily life.</p>
<p>As a popular reading material, it is particularly difficult to write in some aspects compared to specialized works. It needs to be lively and not dry; step-by-step, from shallow to deep; related to life and for practical use; clever, interesting, and attractive. Fabre is not only an expert in these aspects but also a pioneer. Some recent children's or youth readings are mixed with stories and characters, extracting the true face of various sciences through the words of a character. That method was invented by Fabre. The "Uncle Paul" in this book has become a symbol of wisdom, explaining to his nephews喻兒 or 愛密兒 and niece克萊兒 or 瑪莉 the incomprehensible events they encounter in their daily lives; in this way, the reader unknowingly and orderly accepts "Uncle Paul's" tireless instruction. How clever it is to turn dryness into vividness, using examples, speculation, metaphors, and science common sense, all covered with a harmonious coat, making it accessible to everyone. Reading this book is like having a conversation, like listening to a poet lyrically chanting. What you read is not equations, not laws, not conjectures or theories, but just beautiful prose and charming essays.</p>
<p>This book is more practical and closely related to people's daily lives than the author's other works. It is divided into fifty-three chapters, each ranging from three thousand to five thousand words, individually analyzing an event until the reader has a comprehensive understanding; each chapter forms a separate paragraph, and there are clues connecting it to the previous two chapters. The arrangement is very clear, the layout is very reasonable, and the connection is very orderly.</p>
<p>The first thirteen chapters are about clothing, talking about various commonly seen fabrics from yarn, silk, wool, linen, and velvet, as well as some common sense of dyeing and printing, how to weave, how to sew, and general accessories to clothing, such as safety pins; it is very complete, but not profound, and does not lack anything. The following chapters from fourteen to sixteen discuss "Heat Conduction" and "Human Dwellings" with very simple examples. The next fifteen chapters are about the origins, manufacturing, applications, and properties of daily necessities. A total of ash, potassium carbonate, soap, matches, charcoal, coal and gas, kerosene, and glass are listed here, and several daily phenomena are analyzed, such as fire, heat, combustion, light, iron and rust, tinplate, and ceramics. Then comes the section on food, which occupies half of the book, all the way to the end, studying sugar, coffee, tea, salt, oil, water, vinegar, bread, rice, and other twenty or thirty items; yet it is patiently and skillfully, not missing any of the points that should be raised, and not tiresomely fatiguing the audience.</p>
<p>For example, when discussing the topic of "Light," Uncle Paul first lists the progress of various methods of fire-making by humans in the dark, talking about the characteristics and shortcomings, economy, and non-economy of each type of fire-making method. Then he talks about the manufacturing process of several kinds of candles. Then he talks about why oil can burn and the general principles of burning to emit light, how to use ventilation to make it brighter, the principles of lamps and the principles of smoke, analyzing so-called lamp wicks, so-called safety lamps, and Mobil lamps, and finally tracing the relationship between air and combustion. What would have required many words to record, Uncle Paul spoke about so briefly; what originally required some cultivation to understand, Uncle Paul wrote so that even old women could understand; what even if understood might not be immediately applicable, Uncle Paul started from practice, not empty.</p>
<p>In short, this book and its sister works are equally beneficial to the public. In terms of form, it is characterized by popularity; in terms of content, it is based on practicality. This is enough to provide the general public with reading material, so that their lives can gradually be changed to be in line with science, so that they can scientifically explain and scientifically deal with various daily encounters, and not rely on traditional superstitions or just wander around in confusion.</p>
<p>Fabre was born in 1823 and died in 1915. Some of the older scientific concepts and scientific views in his books have been supplemented or revised by the translator, and some have been annotated. Books of the same nature as this booklet include "The Story of Science" (translated by Song Yi), "Tales of Chemistry" (translated by Gu Junzheng), and "The Story of Domestic Animals" (translated by Cheng Shaozong), most of which are published by Kaiming, and there are also two or more translations. These books are similar, but "Talks on Domestic Science" is most relevant to the lives of ordinary people. Fabre's most famous immortal masterpiece is "Insect Records," a total of sixteen volumes, unprecedented and unmatched. There is a translation by Wang Dazhong in our country, which is incomplete, and it was published by Commercial Press last year, and can also be read as an interesting common sense reader.</p>
<h3>"Watch on the Rhine"</h3>
<p>— By Shi Jimei, Author: Lillian Hellman, Translator: Feng Yidai</p>
<p>Published by: New Masses Publishing House</p>
<p>"Watch on the Rhine" is a work by the American playwright Lillian Hellman in 1944. It was once made into a movie, and when the stage play was performed on Broadway, the New York Times drama critic Atkinson commented: "This is the best work written by Ms. Hellman... It is a very important play. The theatrical world should be proud of this script."</p>
<p>The story takes place in the late spring of 1940, in the countryside of the United States, about twenty miles away from Washington, in the Farrelly's home. The male master,育岌 Farrelly, has passed away. His wife, Fanny, is sixty-three years old this year, and her demeanor is still elegant. She is a nervous woman. Her son David, who is thirty-nine years old, is not yet married, and now gets along well with the lodger Martha Ter Blancowitz. Fanny is very unhappy about this, because Martha is married. Her husband Dirk is a Romanian count, but this aristocratic couple lives in the Farrelly's house, and they are deeply in debt and very poor.</p>
<p>This morning, Fanny is more excited and nervous than usual, because her daughter Sarah, whom she has not seen for twenty years, and son-in-law Kurt Muller, are returning with three children - from troubled Europe.</p>
<p>After twenty years of separation, the reunion of family members is naturally joyous. Fanny is so happy that she even forgets that she vehemently opposed this marriage in the first place; the whole family is very excited. Only the Romanian nobleman named Dirk observes with his sharp eyes, coldly investigating everything. This group of ragged, wandering people, whose children can speak the dialects of many places, Kurt, an engineer, has a gun wound on his face, and the bones of his hands are also broken; what is particularly strange is that their luggage is not locked, but an old briefcase is locked very tightly. Therefore, the count became suspicious, and he began to prepare to seize his target like a vigilant hound at any time and place.</p>
<p>Finally, after ten days, the time is ripe. At first, it is an extremely peaceful twilight, but it gradually becomes tense, because Dirk tells Kurt about a piece of news on the afternoon paper: Max, the leader of the anti-Nazi underground movement in Germany, Colonel Freeden, has been arrested. Max is Kurt's comrade and good friend, so Kurt is leaving. However, the cunning Dirk knows everything. He proposes a deal: ten thousand dollars? Or report to the German embassy? The choice is his. However, Kurt says: his money is public donations, not to buy his life; after a long stalemate, Fanny and David are eager to get rid of this shameless nobleman and are willing to pay the money. When they go upstairs to get the money, Kurt kills Dirk. And he, Kurt Muller, is also leaving tonight, because he is going to create a new ideal world. He kisses the children, and then turns to Sarah, he says: "May the living have the best chance to live. I want to live. I want to live with you."</p>
<p>This is the story of "Watch on the Rhine". With World War II as the background, although the story does not directly write about the reality of the war, the author clearly tells us the great significance of this war, and the sacredness of the war zone workers. And let's look at what Kurt Muller said; "... We say that the world is not good, because there are people starving. Before the world is good, people will steal, lie - kill. But no matter what the reason, who does it... it's all not good. I want you to remember this, no matter who does it, it is a bad thing. But you can all live to see that there will be no more killings in this world, in the whole world, in every place, in every city, there will always be people who are responsible for preventing killings. They need the same as us: to give every child a happy childhood. For my children, I also think about their children, think about it, it will make you happy. In every city, every village, every house in the world, there are always children who are loved, and he will create a good world for him... Everyone in this world can die peacefully in bed..."</p>
<p>As long as there are people alive who are suffering, then we are all guilty. Maybe, it's not our fault, but seeing that the world is still not good, there are still people starving, there are still killings and arson happening, people don't even have the happiness of dying peacefully; children still don't have a happy childhood... Everything, even if it's not our fault, don't we feel ashamed? - This book inspires us living people to have the right to "not suffer," and also to understand how we ourselves are "guilty." To understand that this world should not be so "not good," and to also know that a "good" world is what everyone should strive to create and enjoy fairly.</p>
