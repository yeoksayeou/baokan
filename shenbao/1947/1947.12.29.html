<h3>高等教育的新立法</h3>
<p>教育部為整理高等教育，期使我們的大學及專科學校能夠適應現代學術的潮流，曾有「大學法」及「專科學校法」兩草案的起草，呈由行政院核送立法院審議。本月廿二日立院例會，經過一場激辯，完成了該兩項草案的三讀程序，不日即由國民政府公佈施行。「大學法」與「專科學校法」，同為關於高等教育的立法，大學學制鮮有變遷，當茲行憲之際，政府根據憲法精神，重新釐訂高等教育法制，公佈施行，實在是值得學術界教育界重視的一件事。</p>
<p>我們大學在世界上發源最早而歷史最長，惟古時的大學，國子監，國子學等，其體制究與現代歐美大學不同。我們近代大學之起原，始於清光緒廿一年（一八九五年）盛宣懷奏在天津創設中西學堂，翌年李端棻在京師建立大學堂，光緒廿四年京師大學堂成立，這是我國最早的國立大學。雖然在這時以前，清同治元年有同文館之設，因教學目的僅在造就翻譯人才，其語文程度僅及西洋中小學，不能稱為大學教育。國民肇興，重訂學制，高等教育分大學院，大學，高等師範及專門學校，各分本科預科。民國十一年改革學制，受新教育思想之影響，規定得設專科大學，大學行選科制，於是我國的高等教育面目一新。迨國民政府奠都南京，民國十八年公佈大學組織法，學制乃漸趨確定。高等教育分大學，獨立學院，及專科學校三種。大學與獨立學院得設研究所，同時實行廢止預科。依此項學制建立之公私立學府，年有增加與調整，抗戰期內復增設師範學院，專門造就中等學校師資。以我們高等教資發展歷史，學校設備，和國內環境來說，我們大學制度尚在篳路藍縷中，實有待於改進與充實，以適應新的時代需要。</p>
<p>此次「大學法」及「專科學校法」的立法，規定高等教育機關分大學，獨立學院（大學法），和專科學校（專科學校法）三種，與十八年的舊學制相同，與本世紀美國高等教育機關的組織亦大體彷彿。他如學校行政組織，校長，院長，系主任，教授，副教授等之任用程序，大學各種會議之規定等等，大致或承舊貫，或新為規定。其中最值得我們注意的有大學主旨，大學學制，學生入學資格及省市立大學之創置等若干點，願於此約略有所論列：</p>
<p>一，大學主旨之建立　大學主旨乃大學之基本精神，亦拉斯基所謂「大學的職能」。我國大學，前清以端正趨勢，造就通才為主旨。民國元年改為教授高深學術，羊城碩學宏材，及適應國家需要；十八年七月之大學組織法，規定「大學應遵照中華民國教育宗旨及其實施方針，以研究高深學術養成專門人才。」此次「大學法」規定「大學依中華民國憲法第一百五十八條之規定，以研究高深學術養成專門人才為宗旨。」按憲法第一五八條規定：「教育文化應發展國民之民族精神，自治精神，國民道德，健全體格，科學及生活智能。」這是規定教育文化立國的基本精神。此可見如根據憲法該條文的規定，我們所期望的大學，不僅旨在養成高深學術之專門人才，並且應寄大學智能於民族精神自治精神之發揚，民主思想與健全體魄之養成。在世界教育思潮中，本法已明白表出發揚民族文化民主思想的涵義。我們很看不慣時下的大學。似乎只做到販賣一些皮毛的專門智能，而忽略了如何教學生做一個真正能自治而愛國家的優秀公民。而且，憲法原條文並沒有規定大學的主旨在造就「專門人才」，究竟大學應造成「通才」呢，抑是「專才」呢，實是一個聚訟紛紜的問題。今大學既為硬性之規定，是否適合現代潮流和我國國情，似乎還是一個值得考慮的問題。</p>
<p>二，大學學制之規定　立法重在彈性運用，關於文化教育的；立法尤不應作硬性規定。我國現行大學制，原分文理法商農工醫及教育八院，具備三學院以上者稱大學，不合條件者稱獨立學院，而三學院必有理學院或農工醫學院之一，專科學校則分農工醫等類。研究院須備三研究所，每所設置若干學部。此次立法對學制比較的採取彈性規定，重在活用。大學規定大學分文理法醫農工商等院，師範學院應由國家單獨設立，國立大學亦可附設。凡具備三學院以上者稱大學，不合條件者稱獨立學院，不將學科強作規定，這是注意到大學的職能發展。專科學校的學科類別，亦不作硬性規定，這是注重高等教育的實用。研究所之設立，以大學或獨立學院各學系辦理完善成績優良者為限，不分公私立，更不以設置若干學部為限，立法平實，有助大學研究所之發展，當非淺鮮，此比以往大有進步。</p>
<p>三，入學資格之放寬　我國大學舊學制，對學生入學資格規定較嚴，殊不合國家與學施教之精神。此次「大學法」在立院三讀時，關於同登能力應否准許入學問題，曾激辯一小時始獲通過。依大學法第廿六條規定：「大學入學資格應曾在公立或已立案之私立高級中學或同等學校畢業，或具有同等學力，經入學試騐及格者」。專科學校法第十九條規定：「專科學校入學者，應曾在公立或已立案之私立高級中學，或具有同等學力，經入學試騐及格者」。此種放寬規定，予自修學生以投考大學和專校之機會，立法精神公允，表徽了此後高等教育之門牆，決非保護特殊的少數人，大學教育之權利將為好學進取的青年學子所共有；我們不禁為一般清寒學生而有志上進者深深地慶幸。</p>
<p>四，大學分區之趨勢　我國大學在地理上之分佈，雜亂無章，同一區域內，設有多數大學，諸大學間亦無合理之分工，實在一方面是浪費而另一方面則偏枯。我國教育學者久有調整分區之主張。依大學法專科學校法之規定，教育部有審察各地國立大學（專科學校）情形之權，同時又分公立大學為國立，省立，市立三種，在立法時已寓有分區設置之趨勢，這是很必要的。</p>
<p>總之，高等教育新學制，立法較前有了進步，如果行政上今後能有良好措施，我國大學教育當可漸臻於理想之境。不過我們要指出：學校行政和組織上完美，祗是大學體與形的完美，而新學風的樹立，　是大學教育的靈魂。今日我國大學教育，學制固應改進與充實，而新學風的倡導與培養，實較大學制度的建立尤為重要。我們於檢討大學新學制立法後，希望教育當局和教育家，能注意於國家文教立國精神的發揚！</p>

<h3>蘇圖支配希臘控制海峽　美英正會商對策　美援希軍事應重於經濟</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕廿七日訊：英美官員極重要之曾談，將於星期一以後在此間開始。按星期一日係英國內閣開會硏討英國對馬柯斯　導下希臘左派政府所應採取之政策。此間業已交換意見，以決定英美是否應致牒匈·羅·阿·保諸國，查詢各該政府武力及裝備之多寡。按英美係按照和約所規定之條款而作此種查詢者。</p>
<p>〔路透社紐約廿八日電〕紐約時報之華盛頓記者稱，國務院官員立即增加美國對希臘眾事援助之意見，已愈見具體化。由於最近局勢之發展，使國務院之負責官員非僅相信對希臘之經濟及軍事援助，須延續至一九四八年六月三十日現有援助計劃結束之時以後，且覺對於軍事援助應特別注重。希臘共產黨之加緊武裝叛亂及共黨之已建立「臨時民主政府」，顯然使美國之對希政策有重行檢討之必要。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿七日電〕民主黨前衆院外委會主席勃魯姆稱，希臘局勢最近之發展，並非美國擊退希臘共產主義之努力已吿失敗之謂。「若無援希計劃，共產今日殆已席捲希臘全部。若輩一旦踏入，則逐出幾不可能，與其化五百元加以逐出，不如化一元防其進入爲佳。吾人不能退出，此非十五回合之拳鬥，乃極度之鬥爭，吾人必須獲勝，不然，唯賴上帝庇佑。言盡於此，以後蘇聯將顗　土耳其與　靼尼爾海峽，埃及與蘇　士運河」。</p>
<p>〔聯合社紐約廿七日電〕希臘北部共產政府之成立，乃蘇聯決心控制韃靼尼爾海峽之又一重要策略，蓋樹立蘇聯爲地中海大國，乃帝俄歷代君主之夢想。希臘位在該海峽之西，故爲攻守該海峽之有力基地，希士均參加西方民主陣容，故希臘爲保衛該峽現狀之屏藩。蘇聯欲支配希臘進而控制海峽，希臘君宇政府正與共產黨力搏，君主政府倘若垮台，共產政府必隨之而起，成爲莫斯科之附庸，屆時蘇聯必將重新壓迫士耳其接受共管海峽之要求矣。</p>
<h3>英蘇短期貿易協定　已在莫斯科簽字　蘇以糙榖換取英國</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科廿七日電〕英蘇貿易協定今夜在史比里杜諾伐卡宮簽字，該處即爲一九四五年十二月三國外長會議所在。英大使貝德遜代表英方，蘇聯對外貿易部長米柯揚代表蘇方簽字。</p>
<p>〔路透肚倫敕廿七日電〕此間今日宣布：英蘇間之短期貿易協定，已於廿七日在莫斯科簽字。英國可根據該約自蘇聯獲取糙穀七十五萬噸，一月初即可自黑海港口啓運。英國則將以即時可以供給之工業配備，供給蘇聯。蘇聯所要求英方供給之配備，包括鋸木機械。運輸機械。重型電機，流動發電機及土木工程機械。該協定並包括蘇聯償付一九四一年英國對蘇信用放款之條件。據英國商務部發言人稱，爲期數年之英蘇長期貿易協定，將於明年五月間進行談判，屆時並擬以小麥及本材爲談判標的。據本社財政記者甘培爾稱英蘇短期貿易協定之簽訂，較預料略遲數日，但純係由於按術理由。此一協以定蘇聯之糙穀易取英國之機械爲主。英國關於一九四一年之信用貸款協定，亦已作若干讓步。此次英蘇短期貿易協定之本身，並不十分重要，蓋蘇聯根據該約所將供給英國之糙　僅七十五萬噸，，僅及英國向澳洲訂購小麥三分之，然自英商務部長威爾羅在莫斯科與蘇成立該項協定以來之若干發展，則具有特殊重要意義。蘇聯係於實施其幣制改革之前夕成立並發表此一協定，顯然蘇聯認爲與英國之此項聯繫，足以增強蘇聯本國內部之經濟。</p>
<h3>安理會人士注視希局勢</h3>
<p>〔路透社成功湖廿七日電〕安理會人士稱，關於希臘遊擊隊在該國北部成立政府事，除非希臘之北鄰諸國正式承認此一新政府，安理會將繼續認此事爲內部事件。安理會人士並曰，彼等尙不知雅典政府是否擬就南斯拉夫及阿爾巴尼亞協助希臘叛軍事，正式向安理會提起申訴。安理會定岸期二舉行本年之末次會議，而巴西澳大利亞及波闌等三理事國，亦將於星期二之會議中退席，由阿根廷加拿大烏克關三新理事國繼任。安理會議程上之重大事件乃印尼問題，惟於明年一月初，將舉行巴勒斯坦問題之辯論</p>
<h3>在埃及逝世</h3>

<h3>法政府決增加工資　擬與勞工界妥協　法中上層階級均反對許曼措施</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿七日電〕廿七日探悉：許曼政府傳已決定將工人月薪增加二千法郎，以便與勞工界妥協，但上　及中產階級暨法國議會之兩院，愈益反對其經濟改革計劃。</p>
<p>同時，國民議會發生罕見之現象，即一致通過共產黨議員提出之動議，否決國營工廠製造之香烟加價十法郎之決定。查政府所宜布加價至今，不足一週，元老院往常僅係照例通過下院之立法，傳稱現已準備對財政部長雷納梅逸之徵稅計劃，加以阻撓。國民議當已將政府預算一百五十億法郎削减數十億，廿七日又繼續削减九十億。內閣所決定之工資增加率，將於二十八日公佈，此次增加蓋爲財長梅逸對勞工部長梅雅之勝利，因後者贊成增發生活費津貼也。</p>
<h3>法議會通過　預算案第一部</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿七日電〕法國國民議會今日以舉手表決通過財長梅逸所提預算案之第一部，就技術上言，此第一部係將一九四七年普通行政預算總計三千四百八十億法郎，挪後至一九四八年使用，以待整個預算案之通過。</p>
<h3>保太秘密抵曼谷</h3>
<p>〔中央社曼谷廿七日電〕前安南王保大曾為此間法方人士聖誕，前　宴會上之貴客，保大係於廿四日下午偕隨員三人，自香港秘密來此者。</p>
<h3>柯尼柴公路戰事方酣　希臘政府軍增援　出動空軍轟炸戰略據點</h3>
<p>〔聯合社雅典廿七日電〕前綫今日來電稱：政府援軍今夜破壞游擊隊重要據點六七處，並予重創。企圖打開往　城柯尼柴之公路，共軍利用六十六毫米口徑大砲進犯，難民四萬四千人不堪侵擾，紛紛逃避。埃庇魯斯高原爲雪所覆，政府軍携帶重兵器在黑夜掩護下馳抵該地，準備在拂曉時發動總攻。</p>
<p>自卡爾巴吉北面起愛奧尼納與柯尼柴公路全綫戰事方酣，柯尼柴西布洛柴尼橋附近亦有激鬥，政府軍如欲突破游擊隊包圍圈，此一门戶勢在必爭。柯尼柴政府軍雖陷孤立，現仍死守，司令杜伐斯負傷入院後，仍自榻上發號旅令，擊退共軍強大攻勢六次之多。同時政府飛機亦已參加作戰，炸毀距阿爾巴尼亞邊境僅兩哩半之遊擊隊砲臺兩處。長梅逸所提預算案之第一部，就　術上言，互第一部係將一九四七年普通行政預算總計三千四百八十億法郎，挪後至一九四八年使用，以待整個預算案之通過。</p>
<h3>周以德論世界局勢　力主援助中國</h3>
<p>〔中央社坎薩斯州勞倫斯廿八日合衆電」美衆　員德以德頃稱，　聯控制下歐洲各國之人民，均　　戰爭，以求終止蘇聯之奴役。周氏係干基督敎陣綫學生會議開幕典禮中致詞。幷謂，目前有兩個世界，一爲由蘇聯控制之世界，另一由西方國家控制者。準稱，吾人不能長在兩個世界下生存，故必須藉征服或協議以求統一，此種統一，可藉獨裁以謀致，亦可由聯盟而實現。</p>
<p>渠列舉所謂今日世界中匹大淸勢尖銳化之地點：　德國，其問題在德國與其他國家之關係，以及其本身將成爲何種大國。　德國周團之國家，該等國家之人民，均祈禱戰爭，以求終止蘇聯之奴役。　太平洋，周氏指　美國實施則洋政策，即一面援歐，使其對抗共產主義，在亞洲則停止援助，直至中國全部為共黨所控制始止，　美國之問題，應在于如何運用其廣大之資源與力量。</p>
<h3>戴高樂領導法國靑年黨　非共黨工人擬組新工會</h3>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿七日電〕戴高樂之右派信徒今日宣佈組織法國靑年黨，此乃一九四七年　法國政治上第二次衝要發展。第一次爲法國工會之分裂，結果總工會前秘書長石屋領導百萬工人，自組反共「工人軍」。以上兩種組織均因最近匝月之大罷工而起。靑年黨與法國其他之靑年團體，初無分別，但其幾模浩大及由戴高樂領導而顯重要。該黨籌備人稱，全國九士處地方已在組織支部。</p>

<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電」華盛頓官員稱，英國向美貸款總額卅七億五千萬元中之剩餘部份，在九十日內即將用罄，兩國財政官員正在硏究如何維持英國至馬歇爾方案實施時之方法，彼等深恐目前美國國內之政治局勢，尤其由於總統選舉之即將舉行，或將引起其他辩論使援歐立法案無法在三月三十一日以前完成。</p>
<h3>媾和會議召開前日需要聯立內閣　片山表示撑持危局到底</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿八日電」片山首相廿七日出席於首相官邸舉行之日本新聞記者聯盟總會席上致詞，强調在媾和會議以前，需要以祖國爲本位之聯立內閣，現內閣担當時局到底。其要旨：旣組織三黨聯立內閣，當更强化三黨聯立，再建祖國。至進行之新黨遝動，其主義政策，殊欠明確，並不足以城　大勢。爲次破危機，即時積極實行社會主義政策，殊不適當，而擬漸次行之。惟希望從速召開媾和會議，至其準備，業屢有言明。又內閣之進退應立於明確之主義政策上，由國會中之人數力量判定之，若代表國民之國會之總意，支持現內閣，余擬担當困難之時局進於突破危機以至最後。</p>

<h3>車載白骨遊行使人心驚肉跳　大中校萬餘學生義舉寒衣總勸募成績圓滿</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市八十餘大中學校學生一萬餘人，爲協助政府冬令救濟，利用昨日星期休假時間，作全市擴大寒衣總勸募，成績圓滿。昨日全部所得，據初步估計，除同濟，交大，聖約翰，東吳，之江五校共募寒衣二萬三千餘件，現款二億餘元外，其他各校捐募衣款，連同各校自發動勸募以來募集之衣款數字，均漏夜在整理統計，不口即可正式公佈。各校勸募聯絡總站，昨設於善鐘路同濟大學醫學院內，另設北區，南區，西南區，西北區五站，此五站分設於同濟法學院，震旦，交大，幼專等校，作爲休息及轉運處。同濟，交大等校並山動宣傳車七輛及巡迴收衣車數輛，往來市區不息。同濟宣傳車上，載有該校醫學院實習用之骨骼一架，著以破爛單衣，上書「我也是人」四字，瘦骨嶙嶙，觸目驚心。出動勸募學生，均佩有白布V字符號，上善一救飢救寒」四字，自晨至暮，在寒風　冽中，到處奔走。凡車站，戲院，無廳，飯店等公共塲處及熱鬧街區，均有男女學生之踪跡。苦口婆心，向人勸募，慷慨捐輸者頗不乏人。據同濟等五大學寒衣勸募委員會聯席會議主席團及各校勸募會負責人表示：各校捐募寒衣，經數日整理後，將集中於元旦前後全部統籌發出，務使數十萬難胞在急迫需要中得到實惠。今後數日內，則加强各區難民調查與訪問，根　調查結果，發策勵將來之意」。並謂「現代中國文藝作家須認淸國際環境，本國國情，及時代與人民之需要，爲今日內亂苦難中的中國同胞發出眞實的呼聲，創造裨益國民思想生活的精神食糧，俾人民得以早日解除痛苦，國家得以早日恢復和平統一，方不負現代作家之神聖使侖。謹祝本曾同人明年新正開筆大吉，把握新的寫作月標，建立新的寫作作風，創作新的文藝作品，並發展新的文藝事業。」繼由文運會　副主委致詞，常務理事王進珊報吿會務，顧一樵等担任學術講演。餘興節目有趟景深錢化佛柳　圖等之崑曲，徐卓呆之笑話，沈　莉等之朗誦及音樂歌唱平劇等，下午六時許放寒衣，免生　弊。現款部份，　將　數　　　，呈請吳市長准購平價米，否則購買市價米發放。</p>

<h3>「一唱二說三進門」　學生們勸募寒衣博得了廣大同情</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕冷風挾了冰雪，已經訪問過這　華的都市，在攝氏零下的氣候裏，儘管歌　舞榭中依舊是燈紅酒綠，儘管富人們的別　中已燃起熊熊爐火，但　在我們眼前的是幾十萬表不蔽體的難民，他們的生命已臨於死亡的淡緣，他們在寒冷裏　觫，在風雪中顫憟。　誰無父母？誰無兒女？當政府的救濟辦法還在遲遲其行的時候，年靑的熱情的學生們起來了。幾天來爲難民勸　寒衣，分發寒衣的工作，由少數大學創導，像一蓬野火燒遍了全上海，爲苦難中的人們發散出無限的熱量，帶來了無限的溫　。</p>
<p>街頭宣傳車　到處呼喊着</p>
<p>昨天，幾十家大學中學的千百學生更　牲了他們的星期例假，展開了全面有總勸募。三人小組，五人小組，在上海的每一個角落裏奔走，宣傳車輛在街頭到處呼喊，一件件的舊衣服舊鞋帽，從捐贈者手裏，經過　羅，蔴袋，卡率，三輪車，人力軍，集中分配，再運送到各個難民區附近。大學生們親自到貧民窟去訪問調查，認眞地察看難民們的實際狀况把他們所需要的一件件分配發放。</p>
<p>這是一幅表現人類偉大同情心的感人的畫面，其中更交織着許多動人的故事。</p>
<p>不少舊衣褲　牀下翻出來</p>
<p>一組學生到中心區一條里弄去勸募，他們先唱起歌米，屋子裏的人們被　　所吸引，家家的門窗都打開了。這時就出一位同學高聲演說，報吿難民們的苦况，解釋他們來勸募的意義，聽的人大都爲之動容，紛紛去搜尋舊衣服，有的從樓上窗口拋下，有的請他們進門去收取。這一種方式他們稱之爲「一唱·二說·三進門」，是最有效的勸募「策略」之一。</p>
<p>一家住在前樓的女人從牀下　出了不少　衣褲與　十來，她的十一二歲的見子生得很伶俐可愛，也帮着她東　西找，在勸募人員臨走的時候他忽然指着身上的絨綫衫對他的母親說：「媽媽，這絨綫衫已有了一個洞，　我也捐給了他們！」</p>
<p>女孩子聽了　感動得下淚</p>
<p>一家牆上滿佈着許多藝術的小家庭裏，一位靑年很客氣的招待學生們用茶，熱心地找出一件相當好的學生　來，抱歉着說：「因爲內人剛巧出去，否則還可多找一些哩。」</p>
<p>在　山路上勸募的學生們碰到許多住在當地的小朋友們熟心帮忙，自　替他們做嚮導，並挨家挨戶的代爲宣傳。有一位十二三歲的女孩子起先看到一羣人走近來不知是作什麼的，趕快想把門關起來，勸募的同學就對她說：「你穿很暖和，但有許多與你一樣的小朋友沒有衣服穿，快要凍死了。」這女孩子聽後感動得流下淚來，快快跑進去拉住媽媽一定要把許多自己的衣服捐出來。</p>
<p>越是窮人越慷慨</p>
<p>差不多愈是窮人愈是肯憐惜窮人，許多做小生意的，做鞋匠的，都很慷慨的捐出了他們並不多餘的衣物，更有幾位三輪車夫甘願義務運送衣被，堅決不要學生們給予的車資。</p>
<p>相反地，在巨宅深院裏的闊老，却並不如想像那樣可以向他們捐到大量的物資。往往從禁閉着的鐵門的窗洞後面，伸出門房或僕傭的臉米，說是主人不在，無法捐助，請他們到別家去吧。</p>
<h3>破布絮裹身破報紙作被</h3>
<p>雖然在勸募過程中常常遇到諸如此類的閉門羹　其他誤解，學生們的熱忱是始終値得欽佩的。有時候他們深　出動，冒雨發放衣被，毫不顧到　　身上爲風雨所淋濕，祇要看到難民們含笑接受他們的賜予，那些用破布絮裏身的穿上了衣褲，用破報紙作被的蓋上了棉絮，一絲微笑，一聲道謝，已足够使他們感到最大的安慰了。</p>
<h3>市長表示欣慰</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長國楨，昨日上午　席本市專科以上學校得　學生聯歡大會致詞，對各校學生勸募寒衣救濟難民之熱情，認爲可貴，表示欣慰。渠稱：爲免各校勸募發生重　現象，希　有關冬令救濟事宜，將予統一辦理。學生界可在研究及監督冬賑方面多負責任。</p>

<h3>華南走私透視</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿五日航訊〕華南的走私問題，從復員後起，一直到雨年後的今天，這問題還是一樣的存在，始終沒有辦法澈底解決。雖然當局曾盡了最大的努力，用盡了種種積極和消極辦法，定私不但未見遏止，反而一天嚴重一天。根據粵海關最近的報吿：自本年五月至十月，半年內統計緝獲私貨二千五百一十二宗，總値共約二百餘億元，與本年春間四個月內相較，約增六七倍。這緝私數字的增加，固然是海關努力緝私的成績表現，但照這已經緝獲走私的數字計算，則平均每天竟有十三四宗，數目每天在一億元以上。（未經緝獲的在外）由此可想見我國稅收損失數字的驚人。華南走私</p>
<p>主要地點</p>
<p>，當然是在廣州。因爲廣州和香港，澳門兩地密邇，而附近賓安，中山一帶邊境，與港澳昆迎，珠江三角洲各處港　紛歧，出入孔　繁多，總計從港。澳兩地運貨來廣州的入口，恐怕共有一百個以上，走私者利用此種地勢的便利，水陸兩路並用，使緝私人員防不勝防。何况走私者除了一部份爲了生活所迫，以個人爲單位帶一些私貨上落的「水客」之外，其餘全是有組織的走私集團。他們有相當雄厚的資本，有特殊的勢力爲之包庇，甚至勾結匪徒爲之代運。除了廣州，港。澳設立表面正常堂皇的行莊之外，在沿綫交通各站派有專人，用無綫電來互通情報。他們更備有車輛船隻等交通工具，而且都配備相當的武力，如遇到緝私人員截緝，他們首先遞送相當的「禮物」，請求放行。如不接受便隨時準備火併，除非緝私人員也有相當實力，不然誰敢去惹他們？祗有眼巴巴看着他們揚長而去，也佯作沒有看見。所以海關緝私人員所緝獲的，多數是上述以個人爲單位的零星私貨，破獲大規模組織走私，尙不多觀！</p>
<p>據有關方面調查：目前在火車公路和輪船上的零星走私，每天經常有數千人來來往往，而有組織的大小</p>
<p>走私集團</p>
<p>，亦有三四百個之多，經常在各交通綫上活動。他們通常走私入口的，多數是：化裝品。顏料。哥士的·漂自粉·煤油·鹽·玻璃紙·香烟·西藥·布疋等。至走私出口，則以食米·食油。及逃避結匯之桐油等爲大宗。據行轅方面調查：最近一月來單經澳門出口的米糧，即有三萬餘擔之多，所以宋主任子文爲了這事赫然震怒，以本省正鬧糧荒，而竟有此類不法商人將糧食偸運出口圖利，實屬良心喪盡，遂除下令中山及廣州鐵路沿綫等縣地方團隊及海軍憲兵等協助緝私人員，嚴密查緝，有查獲者即處之以極刑，同時並與澳門政府協商，誚其協助，所以目前一般偸遝糧食的私梟，已吿歛跡。</p>
<p>另外，還有一種走私者，是專門偸運工業原料進口。幹這買賣的本來多數是芷當商人，因爲華南做輸入限額分配過少的綠故，許多正當的工商業，所得到政府的分配額與實際際要相差甚遠。他們爲了本身利害的關係，便不惜挺而走險，將黑市外匯去</p>
<p>購買原料</p>
<p>走私入口，甚至或者加入有力量的走私集團，以對抗海關的查緝，他們不承認道是走私，而說這是「地下貿易」。他們的意思是說，並非他們不肯繳稅，而是繳稅政府也不給他們進口。他們雖如是說，但實際他們就是走私的行爲，而且這類商人多數是資本雄厚的，他們這樣正足助長走私集團的實力，因此形成走私更加猖獗了。</p>
<p>的榷，現在的廣州，已成爲走私者的天堂。走私的勾當，早已成了公開的秘密。提起「走私」這兩個字，絕對不會有人感到陌生與驚奇。茶樓·酒館·公共塲所。公開談走私交易，到處可以聽到。這種普遍的不良現象，如果還沒有辦法遏止，對整個國家的經濟前途，實屬不堪設想。據一般有經騐的人士觀察：走私如是猖獗的原因，主要約有變點：　戰事影響，人民生活困苦。　游資集中無出路。　幣値不定，官價外匯過低。　貿易管制過嚴；無法獲得實際需要原料的合理數量進口。</p>
<p>四項原因</p>
<p>中，照目前華南所需要迫切解決的問題，還是最末的一項。假如要問華南的走私怎樣遏止？宋子文主席已經有了一個答案，他在這次省參會上報吿說：「中央雖已與香港訂立緝私協定，並飭海關與海軍加强查緝，惟本省所需原料，如無法獲合理數量之進口，則禁絕走私實感困難，若本雀要求百分之十八之入口配額，如獲中央批准，則必可立即防止走私」。（特派員梁風）</p>

<h3>兗州·棗莊　魯西南行</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿四日航訊〕兗州是魯四南軍事政治中心，徐兗綏靖區李王堂司令官及魯省府西南行署主任彭國棟皆駐此。彭爲人幹練，操守廉潔，生活尤簡單樸實，他的辨公室巾，除了一個書架外，只是一張破舊的三屜桌，窗戶是紙糊的，寒風透入，令人瑟縮不止。我問他生活爲什麼如此簡單，他告訴我「籣單後可以使我們時時想到還在水深火熟中的廣大人民的痛苦，使我們自然而然痌瘐在抱，多爲人民出力」。行署共轄五個行政專員公署，凡卅縣，共一一○○萬人，各縣民間武力本遠較省其他各地爲大，至少亦有槍千餘校，多如滕縣，則在萬枝以上，遺憾的是過去協同不够，指揮不統一致往往爲匪所乘，被匪各個擊破，現行署正擬成立保安部隊聯合指揮所，以收協同合作之效。李司令官住城內天主堂，那裏有東亞第一大風琴。徐兗段西面因有徵山獨山南陽諸湖爲之屏障，只要東面抱牘　（棗莊北）方面的共匪魯南軍區張光中部及徂徠山方面的封振武部被澈底淸剿後，徐兗段的安全是可以確保無處的。臨城和兗州是津浦中段僅有未被共匪攻陷的兩服城治，兩地的車站都保持着相當的完整。過臨城東行廿五公里有支錢通棗莊，但目下該綫因受軍事影嚮，只通陶莊。棗莊前後被匪洗刦達八次，原來日產煤八千餘噸的中興煤礦十六座大樓及南大井北大井，已全部被匪破壞無餘。目下由當地人用士法在圍牆以外開採的小礦井三百餘口中，業已產煤的凡九十餘口，日產一千至一千五百噸。另外，尙有土法煉焦池卅餘個，礦區附近平民賴以生活者六萬餘人。陶莊方面，戰前巾興亦用機器開有小井，後亦被匪破壞。四月前中興公司派員修理後，現已可日出一百噸，俟新式機器運到後，當可日出千噸以上。目下小井多係人民自由開採，最近中興煤礦公司已呈准於明年一月份起全部收回。直到現在，仍爲棗莊人民最關切的問題，乃係棗莊因距張光中匪窟抱牘　過近，致時常有人被匪綁架勤索的現象發生，因此，如何特別加强並統一各地的地方武力，在棗莊尤成為最亟待解決的問題。（本報特派員麗天）</p>

<h3>我們的科學計劃呢？</h3>
<p>— 劉咸</p>
<p>自本刊刊佈晨風君的「英國國立物　實驗室的素描﹞（十二乃一日第十八期），和楊實君的一美國十年科學研究計劃」（十二月八日第十九期）後，頗引起各方的注意，先後接得讀者來信多起，提出了許多關懷或詢問我國科學的問題。總括起來，大意可分二類：第一類是說「英國的科學硏究機關組織那樣完善，工作是那樣的緊張，我國不也有中央硏究院嗎？不也有十來個硏究所嗎？天，地，人，文，動，植，數，理各科都有了歷史也將近二十年，近來又選舉什麼院土，應該也可以像英國的硏究所一樣，替我國做些科學硏究工作，來解決解決我們的民生問題，國防問題。……」第二類的要點，是說「美國科學是這樣發達，還要來個十年科學研究計劃，我國不是以抗戰建國相號召嗎？勝利兩年多了，我們的科學計劃呢？希望也能像美國一樣，來一個十年科學研究計劃。……」</p>
<p>各方讀者對於我國的科學發展，如此關切，如此重視，這確係進步和可喜的現象。不過由許多讀者的來信內容看，我們感覺到大多數讀者對於吾國科學界的情形，認識不足，甚爲隔膜。譬如說，許多讀者對於中央研究院的內容組織，和已往的成績、都不大明暸，以爲有了這樣崇高的科學硏究機關，甚麼困難的科學問題，都可以請他們解決了，這未免期望過奢。又有些讀者很憒端地說，抗戰勝利，機會大好，　建國家，千載一時，要富國裕民，只有發展科學，別無捷徑。他們切望政府再不耍因循坐誤，應從速製定科學建設計劃，迅赴事機，有的說可仿效蘇聯的五年計劃，有的說照美國的樣，也來一個十年計劃。這些意見，世可說是一些呼籲，不管它何時實現，都是很有價値的。</p>
<p>現在我們本科學家的立塲，除對本刊讀者所提供的寳貴意見，十二分接受外（限於時間，對於各讀者投函，恕不一一具覆。）爲國百年大計，對於吾國戰後的科學建設計劃，不能不鄭重指陳其重要性，急迫性，並願藉此喚起全國人士的注意！</p>
<p>第一，自兩顆原子彈提前結束了世界大戰，科學的威力顯露無遺了。我們深信今後世界局勢的推移演變，和人類文明的進步或毀滅，科學實握其機械。爲順應世界潮流，我們應大規模的建設科學事業，以保國際的和平，否則難免被人宰割。</p>
<p>第二，吾國地大物博人衆，得天獨厚，可是現在國家窮困，民生塗炭，政治紊亂，經濟危殆，社會腐敗，推求原因，都是因爲科學不興，人民愚昧的緣故。我們要好好的計劃開發資源，注重硏究，不但富國裕民極有把握，就是政治也可以走上軌道，社會頹風也可以轉變。</p>
<p>第三，抗戰八年，國力大傷，人民所受的痛苦極深，幸虧得道多助，公理戰勝强權，獲得最後勝利，國際地位增高，這種苦盡甘來，難得的成果，我們應善自護愛。建設科學是增厚國力的有效方法，是充實國防的唯一保障，是維持國際地位的不一訣。</p>
<p>第四，我國科學硏究，在抗戰以前的數手、頗見發皇，成績漸其，人才增多，假以時日，不難發揚光大，可惜抗戰軍興，又吿失調，雹碎春紅，霜凋夏綠，這點科學嫩芽又被摧殘殆盡了。我們以爲政府當軸宜正視此時此地的需要，從速裝備科學機關，厚予經費，已萎的可以復活，未設的即便　創，以應急需，以保國命。</p>
<p>第五，吾國科學落後，工業幼稚，要想建設科學，首先要有績密的計劃，那些是基本硏究，那些是實際應用，何者宜先，何者在後，經費如何確定，人才如何訓練，都要預先籌劃，妥爲部署，逐年實施，計時課績，方可以收預期的效果。</p>
<p>第六，行憲伊始，百事維新，可佔歲出總額百分之十五，科學經書將可大大地增加，在沒有正式分配前，我們對於科學部門經費的分配，應該未雨綢繆，擬具計劃，善加利用。</p>
<p>總而言之，我們爲改善民生，充實國防，貢獻學術起見，亟應有一完善的科學計劃的提出，以資準繩。吾國科學界不乏睿智遠見的專家人才，科學建設又爲我們分內的事，責無旁貸，希望各本所知，各盡所長，通力合作，共抒議論，選定一適合國情的科學建設計劃，不議蘇美專美於前，幸海內科學界同仁，共起圖之！</p>
<h3>鴿子是怎樣尋覓方向的</h3>
<p>— 植梅</p>
<p>鴿子是怎樣尋覓方向的？這個問題，是一般人所欲問答而不能問答的。我們常常聽到鴿子長距離競賽，自某地飛至某地，或者去看放信鴿表演。但是總很奇怪，爲什麼牠們能在陌生的地方，飛問到本來的住所？許多科學家也認爲這是一個謎，硏究不出它的所以然來。直至今年九月，這個難題方得到了解答，發現的是顏格理（H．L．Yeagley），係美國一位物理學家，自從第二次世界大戰開始後，即在美軍軍鴿硏究所，從事研究工作。</p>
<p>顏氏開始研究時，就假想鴿子能够感應地球的磁性。曾以下述方法試騐。用了好幾隻鴿子，在他們的雙翅上，各縛了一塊小小的磁鐵，使產生小磁場，混亂地球的磁力錢。結果這幾隻鴿子放了出去後，都迷了路，而未糾有磁鐵的那些鴿子，卻都飛回來了。顏氏因此證明鴿子必能感應也求的犧牲。</p>
<p>但單靠磁鐵的感應性，還不能够飛行。因爲磁力是自赤道漸增至兩極的。一隻鴿子雖能辨出他自己住處磁力的强弱大小，但在一個等磁力綫圈內，可能環繞地球一圈，而依舊迷失路途的。因此我們覺察到，必尙有另一種力量與它相關。</p>
<p>顏民曾假定這種力叫轉應力（Coriolis），由於地球自轉所產生，對於緯度有關，赤道上力較弱，至兩極則增强。顏氏也曾試騐過他的理想，會取盡有緯度的地圖一張，在其上劃出等磁綫，照理輝度與等磁錢，旣然大家自赤道漸增至兩極，應呈平行狀態，但因地極與磁極不在同一位置，且等磁綫稍有彎曲，並非呈整圓形，故兩綫常有雨點相交，在這兩點上，磁力與轉應力强弱，完全不同，假如鴿子從某地放出，可能有一部份飛至此點，另一部份飛至那一點，幸而這兩個交點，通常都在鴿子飛程之外，故通常鴿子都能飛回他的老家，即飛至它飛程之內的較近的一個感應點。</p>
<p>顏氏在地圖上查得，有個奇奈城（Kearney），正與他所居的卞西華尼城（Pensylvanis）（在美國中部），有同樣的磁力與轉應力，假如他的理想不錯，則把他在P城所訓練的鴿子，放在另一個靠近K城的陌生地方，可能被那個同樣的磁力與轉應力引至K城，於是他就在K城築了新窠，於幾英哩之外，放出了所試騐的鴿子，結果那些鴿子都到了他們新的窠裏。於是他就證實了鴿子是靠了磁性與感應性的特殊感覺，而尋出方向的。</p>
<h3>潛水吉普車</h3>
<p>— 鄭佐卿</p>
<p>潛水吉普車能够深入水中六呎，整個軍　幾乎全部浸入水中，要不是可機山頭部必須露在水面的話，倒眞是的的刮刮的潛水艇了，該車係美國海軍部設計，旨在水陸兩用以便作戰，外形與普通陸上吉普車全部相同，但是另外裝置了一百二十五個特別機件，包括密不透水的引燃機構，排氣管引伸裝置和露出水面的「呼吸」管（Breather　Pipc），司機必須穿戴潛水衣，潛水帽除外。該車四輸刻有槳狀紋路，躍入水中以後，故亦能遝轉自如，速途比在陸上並無遜色云。據海軍發言人聲稱，該車如能在大戰時候早已應用，則在沙灘侵入戰及强渡戰中不少生命將得拯救。</p>
<h3>「毒氣」</h3>
<p>— 趙震</p>
<p>一講到「毒」，我們就有一種害怕的心理，覺得「毒」是對於我們不利的。但是要知道，「毒」究竟是什麼？……平時我們肉體上，受了狙擊以後，神經官系就能很容易的，使我們感覺到一種痛苦和難受，然而不多時，我們身體上的細胞組織，又恢復了起來，不再覺得是痛了；但是我們往往在不知不覺之巾，已受了「毒」了，等到受傷的事態擴大了，——身體上的組織受了「毒」的侵蝕，起了劇烈的變化，道時，我們方才知道已遇到了「毒」，例如：在嚴寒的冬夜在一問窗戶閉得不能空氣暢流的房間裏，生了火爐，結果時常在報上，可以看到全家死亡的慘事。——的確，「毒」委實是駭人。有「毒」的物質很多，如果在固體或液體狀能）的，那我們就可容易的覺察到。但是在氣體狀”態的時候，它就混縣在空氣之中，根着空氣的流動，隨處和我們的肉體接觸，這時，我們就無形無踪的被「毒氣」打倒了。所以在有毒的物質中，「毒氣」是最可怕，——「毒氣」能隱藏它的面目，因此就使我們防禦不及；而且它所侵及的空間，沒有限制，它可以隨着風向而移動，到處是掃略人類。</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰中，德國製造出許多種的「毒氣」，作一種軍事上的武器：Phosgene是第一次先用到的「毒氣」，——是一氧化碳和氯氣化合而成的一種不穩定的氣體；而且它比空氣是重。所以如果那一陣「毒氣」的烟霧，吹來的時候，密密地覆蓋在地面上，因此即使躱在溝臺裏的兵士，或者在設備不週的防壕內，也脫離不了它的侵入。等到這烟霧充滿在你四週的時候，立刻就使你死亡。——因爲，在這時候四週的空氣，都已經被它排除，你就再也得不到空氣的供給；然而，這氣體，一經被你吸進了，就開始分解；結果，非但它能漂白肺腑，而且在體內各部份流動着的血液中，所有的紅血球素，都可以被它還原而因此破壞，於是一切的呼吸器官，都失一去了功用，當然，在這時候，一定被窒息而死去了。從一周受害，四肢灰白色的，表示着一種曾經有過極度掙扎的狀態；眞使人們可憐他。所以這氣體的講名，很國默的呌做「福斯近」。Mustord　gas——芥子氣——，也是一「毒氣」中很可怕的一種。在第黎，巴黎的人民被它傷亡了許多；他們先在皮膚上發起泡來，同時，逐漸的腫脹，最後連皮肉都龜裂了，於是很劇烈的腐蝕身體上的肌肉，一時究沒有念施的方法去醫治，在短短的廿四小時內，死者祗存下一付完整的骨骼。</p>
<p>我們都怕這種「毒氣」；但是要知道，毒氣的種類很多呢，他們各有他們的時殊性質，來刺激人的各種器官。例如：Chlorpicrin和Benzyl－chlprioce一種稱爲擴散性「毒氣」，刺激鼻官的一稱ciphenylchor－arsine氣體，以及笑氣（Laughiog　gas）類，都可以致人於死地。現在所發見的「毒氣」有數百種之多，所以科學的發展，却是帶給人類的一種殘酷；但是我們不可以因此而拋棄科學；我們要挽回中國的危機，昔從科學着手不可。——中國的科學的發揚光大，眞要我們來發掘呢！</p>
<p>科學趣味</p>
<h3>燙髮的科學</h3>
<p>— 加另</p>
<p>燙頭髮是摩登的，婦女們最關心這三千煩惱絲。飯可以不吃，頭髮不可不做。雖然歐洲在中世紀時候貴族男子也都曲髮披肩，但是在我國的歷史上部查不出曲髮的記載。所以要想在錢裝書中找到一句形容曲髮美觀的文詞，根本不可能。燙髮原是歐西的文明呀！</p>
<p>理髮師先把妳的頭髮仔細洗淸，除淨頭脂和油汚，剪成適度的長短，然後塗上一種「藥水」，再捲在電夾中烘成曲曲的形狀。所謂「藥水」其中主要成分爲亞硫酸鈉（Sodiym　Sulfite再加入硼砂，氨，或炭酸鹽類。</p>
<p>原來我們頭髮的蛋白質是Keratin，其中含百分之十五的Cystine。唸過化學的人都知道Cystine的分子是由二個氨基酸被二個硫黃原子所連繫而或。這不斷交錯的Cystine鏈使頭髮呈現特有的形狀和性質。假如把Cystine的－S－S－鏈破壞，那末頭髮就可改變成任何的曲度和形狀，不再堅持它的原形了。</p>
<p>所以我們利用硼砂，氨等弱鹼質和還原性的亞硫酸鹽來破壞分子構造，藉了熱力和機械的帮助，加速化學作用的進行而完成曲髮的使命。</p>
<p>為何火燙不能持久？</p>
<p>電燙沒有發明前，大家利用燙鉗來「火燙」，以熱力來使頭髮就範。因爲祗有物理作用而沒有化學變化，所以「火燙」不能持久，二三天後頭燙完全恢復舊觀。</p>
<p>美國科學家樂於爲婦女們效勞，繼玻璃絲襪後發明了「冷燙」，來代替奶油電燙。這種冷燙，旣不需要電流，也不必有燙機，任何地方，任何時間，都可舉行，簡單，便利而又安全。</p>
<p>冷燙（Cold　Wave）</p>
<p>妳可以不必趕到理髮店或美容院去，就在府上，祗須購買二種曲髮藥水，就可開始冷燙了。洗凈頭髮後，使用第一種藥水，即可使它自動皺曲起來，隨心所欲地做成任何形式。然後用第二種藥水來固定它。美觀而新奇的曲髮就產生了，最後你把剩餘的藥液洗去，「冷燙」已經吿成了。這種曲髮藥水美國已有多家化粧品公司製造，不久就會走私到上海來吧！</p>
<p>說穿了，這戲法毫無神秘。第一種藥水含有Ammonium　Thiglycollate能够把－S－S－還原到二個－SH的Cysteine。而第二種藥水不過是酸化的雙氧水而已，把Cysteine新氣化爲Cysteine，但是排列的地位改變了，所以產生了持久而穩固的曲髮。</p>
<p>科學漫談</p>
<h3>營養（上）</h3>
<p>人生不斷地需要食物，平均每人終身所進的食物約重五十噸左右，大概每進七十磅的食物，才能長成身體上的一磅肉。這種食物可以說是一種製造體質的原料，也可說是一種發動能力的燃料，我們每天所進的食物，平均含3000卡熱的勢能PotentialCalorie），身體再把這種勢能，依相當的比例而變爲動能，（健康的人約將勢能轉變30～40％爲動能，這種能量與高等植物的機械效率相近，而爲普通自動機械率的四倍），以供工作之用。</p>
<p>以普通的食物來看，炭水化合物與蛋白質在體內發生氧化時，每克能生四卡的熱量，脂肪能生九卡的熱量，水以是組成食物大部份的重量，並不產生什麼能量，可是在生理上的作用却很大。</p>
<p>除此以外，人類對所進的食物往往將它備藏起來以備不時之需，所以一個身體强健肌肉發達的人，他能不進食物維持生命到一兩個月的時期，這就是因爲他的身體組織中，至少存在7500卡的潛熱，這些一能量足以使一個靜着不動的人延續生命到七十五天之久。</p>
<p>我們的食物原料，上面已經提到，通常可以分做蛋白質，脂肪，碳水化合物與礦物質等四大類。像大麥，小麥，米，白糖這些都是所謂碳水化合物，它主要的功用是產生能量。脂肪在人體的代謝作用中，大概能和碳水化合物發生交互作用。健康者全部食物的能量，大約40～50％得自碳水化合物，30～35％得自脂肪而且脂肪往往成一種保護層環繞着神經，顯然地像一層墊子以防禦神經所受突然的震動。我們看到飢餓時的人往往容易激怒，那就是因爲神經四週缺乏脂肪的緣故。脂肪的功用還不止此，要是食料中缺乏脂肪，我們身體便不能取得那些脂肪溶性的維他命，因此生理上就要發生很大的危險。通常我們的身體雖然可從碳水化合物中製造出脂舫來，但是有許多無法製造的脂肪質就不得不從其他動物身上取來，所以多吃肉食，我們並不要加以反對而且可以重視。</p>
<p>蛋白質是形成細胞生命部份原生質的要素，它的分子非常複雜，可是也不過是很少的幾種元素組合而成。大部分的蛋白質含51～55％的碳，70％的氫，20～23％的氧，1．55～2％的硫，有些蛋白質更含看極少量的燐或鐵。普通植物能够組合銨基酸（Amino－acid）而形成維持生命的白蛋質，動物再由這些銨基酸製成本體的蛋白質，可是動物並不能像植物一樣的把簡單原素造成銨基酸。由此看來，動物非藉植牧不能生活。現在已經檢定約有二十一種銨基酸是存在於天然的蛋白質中，假如動物是健全的話，至少在這種二十一種銨基酸中要有幾種含在他所吃的食物之中。這二十一種銨基酸在化學上至少可以形成2，432，902，176，640，000多種蛋白質，或是類似蛋白質的化合物，其中有幾百種已經有過硏究上的証實，更有千餘種亦已知確能存於自然界中。</p>
<p>現在已有研究結果，證明身體健康的條件，至少須有50％的礦物質，這種分量是一個健康人最低限度，根據這個標準，每個成人，一天必須獲得0．86克的鈣，倘使取入的鈣質兩信於此數，則其健康更爲增進，至於吸入鈣質的目的，則因爲我們的骨與齒時時在進行腐蝕，新的分子接替着老的分子，於是身體傳將鈣質繼續不斷地內外排解，通常我們身體內全部的鈣在每六年後全部更新一次，這時要是鈣質取入不足的話，身體就得由骨與齒上取下鈣質來加以調濟，這樣一來，身體就要發生大大的不幸了！</p>
<p>燐與鈣在人體裏的作用，眞如電對電光的關係一樣，兩者都是形成齒與骨的必需原料，在三年之內，我們對於憐的吸入，至少要及鍔的兩倍，不過我們大部份的食物，它含有　的成分，往往較鈣來得豐富，所以這倒是不成問題的事。</p>
<p>人體所含的鐵質，只能做成價値十個辨士那麼重的一隻釘子，雖然含量並不算多，可是體中要是沒有鐵質的存在。那就根本沒有血液。高等動物的血中都含有帶鐵質的血紅棄（Hemoglobin），所謂「貧血指數」，就是看他的血紅素的含量而定。我們每天體內8％的血球在破毀，要是沒有食物中的鐵質的補償，那末血球的數量就要反常而發生貧血病症。[A&gt;本報週刊次序</p>

<h3>談老</h3>
<p>— 季用</p>
<p>外國是敬老的，總統差不多都在五十歲以上，表示到這個年齡，經騐能力已臻爐火純苛之候，六　在御，可以得心應手。所以才有四十是生命開始的說法。我們看了將近九十的蕭伯的翁，仍然不斷發表他的驚人巨作，年逾花田的邱吉爾翁，也是虎虎有生氣，艾德禮的工黨政策眼看垮台了，這位老英雄還在摩拳擦掌，豫備再給大英帝國爭回太陽不洛的光榮，至於鬍子已經白了的斯達林，更是老謀深算，在他的掌握中，把持着最近一百年的世界命運。</p>
<p>然而在東方就不大很行。日本有人說「人生四十，猶靦顏視息，無益於人，無益於已，實在不如死去爲愈，」斯言也，常然是有所發而然，可是這諷刺的對象一定可以斷富是四十以上的老人。雖然孔子是卅而立，四十而不惑，七十才從心所欲，不逾矩，而在一般「下愚」，恐怕倒是這等年齡更惑，更逾矩，因而也就談不到眞正的「立」。連孔子自家不也說過嗎：「及其老也，戒之在得」，「四十五十而無聞焉，斯亦不足畏也矣！」不足畏還是小事，好像消極的與社會沒什麼相干，這個貪得可真是中國的致命傷，無論怎麼戒，總是不行。對於這一點，我們覺得中國由來所提倡的敬老一事，似有商量之必要。而公務員年齡資格之規定，亦應再加考慮。</p>
<p>你看，「老成持重」究竟是好還是壞？「老奸巨猾」，「老朽昏庸」就還不客氣了，「倚老賣老」更使人作三日區，而「老糊塗」一語殆可以包括一切矣。屠格涅夫「父與子」，痛恨兩代的矛盾，我們無論年靑與年老，大約總是同情下一代。可是眞的到我們有了兒子，還是一樣忘記年靑時的苦痛，譬如婚姻和思想就永遠不能與第二代相融洽。故有人主張一個人必需做日記，不爲別的，只爲到自己小孩要求上公園而你發脾氣不答應時，翻翻日記有「我想到公園去」，就可以釋然了。那麼，日記也就是還債的根據，使我們消滅了債　人的身分，而成爲債務人。</p>
<p>最奇怪乃是矛盾永遠在一個人身上，今日納妾的就是當年提倡女權運動的急光鋒，主張孝爲百行光而大印二十四孝岡詠的又何嘗不可以是隻手打孔家店的英雄？我所說東方老人之不足爲訓者主要在此。聖經鬢傳永遠主張敬老者恐亦爲了一般人對他們並不衷心敬佩之故罷？我始終相信荀子的話：「苟有之於中者，必不求之於外」，要求敬老，亦即由於對老不敬耳。不但對老不敬，彷彿大家認爲有了一把年紀，也使可以休息一下，無須與後輩爭一日之短長了，所以馬伏波擊鞍上馬，　鑠目矜之時，米嘗不引起後人的嗤笑，也許就是一句「老不要臉」之類乎？秦漢以來，地方自治人員謂之鄉三老，大約也就是今日之土豪劣紳，在我的預想中，老實無用的農民，總免不掉要吃　他們的苦頭。這些人，年齡當不會少於四十歲，「三老五更」有人說就是「三老五叟」呀。</p>
<p>人生的道途是充滿了坎坷的，坎坷的由來，多半與老有關。年靑的時候被石頭絆倒，到後來還是化作石頭去絆人，爲什麼不可以把石頭拋在遠處去，否則放在河水或泥澤裏也還可以墊脚濩人呀。歲盡年增，空長一歲，我在自警，亦以警人。</p>
<h3>鬼怪</h3>
<p>— 郁原</p>
<p>前幾天在本舊英文雜誌上　到一個很有過的事，那是說美國某城中有一個尙有名氣的醫生，在夜牛人靜的時候，獨自解剖屍體，正在他解剖得起勁的時候，忽然，那死屍嘴角一搬，撲嗤一笑！於是這個醫生便昏了過去。等到第二天平上人們發現他時，他早已離開了這個世界。這件事立刻引起了人們的驚詫注意，許多醫生爲了追求眞理，便又重新來解剖這可怪的屍體，終于他們打開了這個謎，原來人有一根笑神經，剛死了不久的人，他的笑神經尙有作用，當解剖屍體無意觸到了它，於是死屍便發出了可怖的笑聲了。</p>
<p>道件事假如在我們中國，那麼，這個醫生的解剖室一定會被着狂的人們擠破，那個「作怪」的屍體也許會被有生意眼的人翼去或租去開個什麼展覽曾，　門票，登廣吿，好發一筆鬼財，醫生們恐怕也沒有這股勇氣敢重來解剖，而報紙在半個月之內都將被這件新聞擠滿。</p>
<p>可不是麼，我們可以常常聽到一些什麼「怪火」之類的新聞，還隱隱暗示有「狐仙」之類作祟，其實這種現象用科學來解　，實在是一種自燃的化學變化，有些東西在普通溫度之下能緩慢地與空中氧氣起作用，若這件東西是放在個不大通風的地方，那麼它的溫度漸漸增高，達到發火點時便燒起來了，譬如說一個木匠他無産將一塊漆油漆的布中遺放在地板下或天花板上，於是久而久之，便發生自燃的現象了—當然，「狐大仙」又顯了一次靈！</p>
<p>人家有了可疑的事便分力硏究，追求眞理，可是我們則不然，什麼趕屍放　那些神奇的鬼話不是還存在麼？有些人爲了找刺　，故意地將一些小事說得活龍活現，有些人也許是知道共中「玄妙」；但不肯說淸楚而煞了風景。更有些人咬定成見不問眞僞；還有些人要在別人面前顯得自已博學多才，便自哄哄人地胡吹一頓；就這樣，眞理便絕了跡，而鬼怪便滿處皆是了。</p>
<h3>說謊</h3>
<p>— 則仕</p>
<p>今晨命小兒去領戶口汕，近午空手回來，說要下午才可以傾，到了下午自己前往油店，却說要到下週才發，問下午可發之說何來，答日：大概是你家孩子說的謊話。心頭爲之大怒，就把說謊的孩子痛打了一頓，餘怒未息，乃去左近舊書店閒逛以散心，東看西瞧了一會，忽見有一小書，名爲「戰時說說集」，作者還是一位出身　士著名的英國之爵士呢。</p>
<p>打開一看，眷首就是作者所引的有關說謊之妙語，如「戰一宣之後，首受創傷者即爲眞實。」如「你知道戰爭受着一種議論的支持，這種議論在嚴爭結束之後，人民就發覺原是絕不應該傾聽的。」如「用謊話　錢比之誠實容易。」作者在序論中也說：「說謊乃一公認的十二分有用的作戰武器。」此書初版於一九二八年，其中材料當然集自上次世界大戰，似乎不免陳舊，但一九四○年一月尙出八版問世，可見或有足資後人借鏡的材料，好在原定價不過二先令六辨士，今旣淪落舊書攤上待沽，想亦不至索價過鉅，乃向店主問價。</p>
<p>「四萬元。」</p>
<p>「什麼！」</p>
<p>「四萬並不貴，作舊紙頭稱斤買也値得到這點。你今天不買明天就要改價目了。」</p>
<p>「改為二萬？」</p>
<p>「起碼六萬！」</p>
<p>我明知他說得全市謊話，但書上明說「用謊話賺錢比之誠實容易」，據九書攤既以賺錢為目的，賺錢又以容易為上策，我何能責其說謊。且平心而論，書在百物之中，其價實屬最廉，目前一包較好的香煙就須三萬多錢，一塲較好的電影也在二萬左右，而一包香煙的結果，是二十個煙　頭，一小缸烟灰，一塲電影的剩餘價値，是一張說明書（還得另外花錢）。書呢，即使四萬元一本吧，看完之後姑不論共中有否黃金之屋如王之顏，大而言之可借友人，足遺子孫，小而言之亦能物歸原店，獲利倍蓰（如能囤積三月半年的話）。中國人之善打算盤既已國際聞名，中國人之敬惜字紙又屬歷史悠久，那麼，當書價之廉遠在百物以下的今日，出版界盛况似乎應該空前一了。誰知事實竟不然，現在中國人之於書籍，好像頗有點當時孔夫子對鬼神的態度——敬而遠之了。</p>
<p>說老實話，我也並沒有把戰時說謊集買了下來，因爲我還價三萬元書店主人老是搖頭，一怒之下就拂袖而去。回家途上，我却買了二隻橘子，給予因說謊爲我痛打的孩子。在肅的時候我却撒了一個說：「路上碰到何伯伯，他送你這二隻橘子。」其實我心裏要說的真話是：「你這個有出息的孩子，你將來一定很會賺錢，因爲你會說謊。你將來有上政治舞台的希望，因爲你會說謊：說謊的人有賞！」</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<p>第六章　如此良宵　（二八）</p>
<p>渚爾喜道：「那末，你不是要隨開北平，因爲我不回來，所以你才寫信這樣說，是不是？我實在對不住，爲了任務沒完，不能抽空回來。」綺紈正色道：「不，我眞是要走的，我不能不走。」綺紈說到這一句，臉色立形黯淡，接着又脫道：「這次我在醫院養傷，外間本不大注意，我回來之後，便有許多謠言，尤其是那個姓林的，三番四次，來找我糾纔不淸，因此外間又添了許多閑話。我家庭裂，也發生反應，我受內外夾攻，雖堪極了，很想離開此地，暫避一避。在去年就有人約我到淡口去，我父親不贊成，就作罷了，現在又有人約我和哥哥以及班底，到濟南露演，我哥哥和各人都贊成，祇我父親不讓我去，爲什麼理由，他老人家又不肯說，只堅決表示說，「你們要去，我就不能活了！我爲的右機會不去，未免可惜，並且包銀也想當滿意，再三向父親央求，父親抵是不肯。我請父親說明所以不能去理由，我們看實在不能去，就不去了，我父親說：「不爲什麼，你們不怕出事，你們就去，你們離開北平城，再想看見我，就不容易了。」我和我哥哥都覺得老人家過於擔心，聲明濟南距離北平並不遠，絕不會出事，已經接沿妥了，不應　過機會，只這幾句話，便惹起老人家拍桌子。大　直說：「你們做兒女的，沒有一人聽我話，又何必來問！大家旣然如此，我一切不管，我老了討人嫌！」嚷了幾聲「不活了！活不了！」　箱倒地，拿出皮大衣和皮帽，點起火便燒，我哥哥再三賠罪，才息怒。自那天一生氣，當晚渾身發熱，就病倒了，我外面受同業議刺，家里又遭這樣不諒解，急得無路可走，後來還是朱師傳，替我出主意，仍請我父親老友王壽山出面，和父親慢慢勸解，直到前天才答應我和哥哥回去，我弟弟和弟婦留在北平伺候老人家。我忙着和各方接洽，一切總算都準備好了，明天一早便要動身，我爲了在未走之前要見你，所以才寫信吿訴你。」　值說到這裡，心酸難過，眼淚盈盈，倉在眼眶裏，幾乎要墮下來，極力忍住，看着　齋。這時小王媽推進門來，端了兩碗藕絲麵，和兩碟小菜，擺在桌上，精　齊用膳。</p>
<h3>錢也者</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>唐書河間王孝恭，少沉敏，有識量，長而征討四方，所至有功。嘗謂人曰：「吾所居頗壯麗，非我心，常別營一區，令粗足充事，吾歿後，子也才，易以守，不才，不爲他人所利」云云。此與漢時疏廣「賢而多財，則損其志，愚而多財，則益其過，且富者，衆之怨也，吾旣無以敎化子孫，亦不欲益其過而生怨」之語，其識見卓達，先後正同。南史稱：「王鎭惡旣定關中，威名鎭主，收子女玉帛甚盛，帝以其功高置之，時有白鎭惡異志者，帝險使人站之，見其方錄取師庫金銀，而棄　於垣側。帝曰：「鎭惡愛金銀，其無遠志可知也。」心乃安。」此即錢能損志的明證。本來錢是社會上的流通籌礪，吃用可以過得去就够了，多則何益！像明朝未年時的嘉定伯周奎以及太監王之心等，當李自成兵逼京師，祟幀帝徵其助緔，周奎謝無有，王之心最富，亦僅　萬金，其餘　不名分文，後京城破，諸人被執，極刑榜掠，迫使獻金，斷不滿意，仍復受刑，結果王之心被拷追金十五萬，周奎抄去銀五十二萬，陳演斷銀三萬，金三千，珠三斗，於者多寡不等。其時受刑不過，魏豫懲，方岳貢，丘瑜等俱自殺。我想此等財富，當時假使捐充兵　，則事百為，亦未可知，然周等鄙　成性，不肯出此，直待戒來用刑拷掠，才「服服帖帖」的現出來，而魏等直至受刑不過，乃冉自殺，眞所謂「到死方知財是禍」了。按南史齊書載：東昏　無道，蕭衍兵入，戰屢敗，猶　上賜，茹法珍叩頭爭之，答目：「賊來獨取我耶？何稱向我索物！」稱史至此，眞令人哭笑不得！袁簡齋詩云：「萬物皆可愛，惟錢最佳趣；生時招不來，死時帶不去。」寄語豪富諸公，凡事都要想得穿些，不要抵在銅錢眼裏翻筋斗。</p>
<p>繡像重慶評話</p>
<h3>打風舉隅</h3>
<p>— 白蕪文龍生盡</p>
<p>例如有人問我，什麼是重慶社會最嚴重的社會問題，除了吃飯。我將翻開任何一天報紙的本市版指給他看：「打」的新聞佔了百分之十强。</p>
<p>打風不自今自始，而今天則已發展到如火如荼；倘說民性驃悍，則四川是數不到的，最初，祗有敎塲口才天天有人「打錘」（渝語：互毆或羣毆），那里，因爲是「飛機」（渝語：流氓）的集中地；流氓是職業的打錘家，不打方是意外，而今天，則顯然頗多業餘的打手了。</p>
<p>常常打捶的是礪頭起卸工人，爲了爭奪工作的機會，打是不足爲怪的，存竸爭是那麼尖說。</p>
<p>天天照例打捶的是戲園，粥少僧多，不給進來看白嚴便訴諸一打，而戲園門前「把柵子」的便是以經得起拳頭爲條件的職員。</p>
<p>奇怪的是打風實入了學校：重慶大學體育系學生，因一個同學戲稱之爲馬戲班，而打傷了十七個同學之多。</p>
<p>一個甫慶地方法院的法官，在辦公室把書記官打了，則顯然是審訽毆辱案過多的心裏影響，聽多了戲的人往往成爲好的演員，不知不覺便唱了起來。</p>
<p>小孩們在街蒼裏打架，出了命案，亦復嚴見不鮮。</p>
<p>前幾天在李子　看到兩個人扭打，儼然以Cow　boy的姿態動手，一個打對方下頭，其一則倒下以脚絆其對方，按術就頗熱練，雖然皮開肉綻，解血如注，並非練習或打得好玩。最妙的是，一個戴著大磐子帽子，一個穿着皮茄克，彷彿是故作美國西部放牛娃裝。</p>
<p>這目然由於普遍的苦悶心理的發洩，但却多少由於優越感的意識，恃强凌弱，恃衆暴寡，雖然打捶家不必是尼采哲學信徒，但吃　你的心情是有的，於是一切訴諸力。聽說國民心理衛生家曾開會討論，不知對於這「聖地打風」有無檢討與結論？倘沒有，我倒想用一個字貢獻——卍」。</p>
<h3>溥老之死</h3>
<p>— 凌霄漢閣</p>
<p>昔聞蔡孑老生前有言，死後願以遺體供醫學解剖，發明病理，有益後人。大哲熱誠卓見，自是不同流俗。</p>
<p>張溥老一生光明磊落，人格偉大，其身死情形，於衛生之這，有値得硏究之處。其得病甚驟，而瞑目過速，故無遺言，且亦未必考慮及此，但溥老有　。亦必以老彬如下所述爲不謬，而欣许之。</p>
<p>據津民國日報電訊，溥老連日勤勞審查立委候選人名單，迄未稍息，故十五日起床特遲，早飯至黨部，午至黨史編纂會，下午又至黨部開會後，又至總裁室商談。回家後，又翻閱文電及進晚餐，飯量較往日多食一碗。餐後不久，即喊腹痛，一大夫以夜深不至又一大夫至而人已垂絕，病狀初疑是盲腸炎，後乃幫謂「吃壞了」！</p>
<p>吃飯所以養生，反而壞事，且以致命，吾今舉北平一事爲證</p>
<p>兩個車夫，攪了一天座，得錢甚豐，很高興的在餅攤上吃晚飯。甲食量甚豪。乙與約曰：「你有本事，把五斤大餅一頗吃完。今天算我的東道！」　欣然許可，於是大嚼大胭，頃刻而盡，乙如約付資作別。甲回家初覺爆賬，繼感五內悶結，終乃痛苦支撐，氣閉而亡，或云深夜不及施治，或云窮人無力延醫。然設想假使醫到，又將如何？蓋此非常病，亦非急病，無病名，無診例。痞可施手術：此非痞也。砒可用歡樂，此非砒也。</p>
<p>溥老勤忙一日，歸而飽餐，人情之常。其家人之延醫求救，人力已盡，大夫之無法施治，亦屬實情，而說明「吃壞了」便是此道高手，不落幫　敷衍麻朝之俗套。總之此事無可埋怨，若以病論，完全意外。即飲食謹愼，而當「撥者易爲食」之際，誰暇預策萬全？</p>
<p>然就以上兩事合併參考使後人由此記憶：勞人易饑，不宜急食，更不可過飽。」則造福無量，視捨遺體供解剖學理之研究者，尤有實效。日常生活極易忽略</p>

<h3>「貧婦助產」節團擴大　惠生產科醫院加入合作　明年一月份開始貧窮孕婦均可申請</h3>
<p>記得有一句古語說：「始創之物，其形必　」，那麼「貧婦助產運動」，也正符合了這句話的涵義。在今年二月問，這個運動在客觀條件的迫切需要下，草率的列入了木報「社會服務」的項日裏面，當時爲了人力和物力的限制，這個遝動只可用緩慢的速度推動著，我們用有限的力量，去爲貧婦服務。　十個月來，同人等不斷的苦幹，不斷的學習，同時也不斷的策勵自己，我們恪守着「有志竟成」的古訓，埋頭苦幹，來保護道個誕生未久的幼芽，使它慢慢的茁壯起來！　在始創的時候，與我們合作的，只有人和醫院一家，每個月受到帮助的產婦，只有二三個人，但是到今天，合作的醫院，已經增爲四家，每個月受惠的產婦已經有五十人之多。　從明年一月一日起，南市大南門黃家沙一六七號惠生產科醫院也將加入道個集團，爲貧窮的產婦服務。　申請手續仍照過去和四家合作的簡則，我們希望在不久的將來，「貧婦助產」的合作醫院，能夠宣佈全上每，吏每一個無力生產的貧窮婦女，都得到科學的接生，和新式的醫藥照料，這却是一件最有益人羣的義舉。</p>

<h3>Chairman's Special Plane Arrives in Hankou; Summons Bai Chongxi and Other Senior Generals; Gave Instructions to Ma Hongda and Zhang Zhizhong Before Departure</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Chairman Chiang's special plane departed Nanjing for Hankou at 1:30 PM on the 28th, and is expected to return within two or three days. It is also reported that Chairman Chiang will preside over the ancestral tomb visit on New Year's Day of the 37th year [1948]; members of the National Government and personnel above the section chief level will accompany him. Afterward, they will return to the National Government for a group New Year greeting, followed by a luncheon in which Chairman Chiang will also participate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Chairman Chiang departed Nanjing by special plane this afternoon, arriving in Hankou. Yu Jishi and others accompanied him. Upon arrival in Hankou, he immediately summoned Bai Chongxi and other senior generals for a meeting, and it is anticipated that there will be significant developments in the war situation in Central China in the future.</p>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 28th] Guo Chan, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Service Forces, arrived in Hankou by plane from Nanjing at 4:45 PM on the 28th.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Ma Hongda arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 28th. After a short rest, he visited Zhang Zhizhong at 10:00 AM, and at 10:30 AM, accompanied by Zhang Zhizhong and Tao Zhiyue, they went to Chairman Chiang's official residence on Huangpu Road for an audience, departing at 11:30 AM. It is reported that the Chairman instructed Mr. Ma to return to his post quickly so that the Ningxia Army Corps Command could be established as soon as possible to annihilate the bandit troops in the Northwest.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Rampage in Hubei; National Army Recovers Xuchang on the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Hankou Dispatch, 28th] Military News: The 12th Column of bandits entrenched near Zhongxiang in central Hubei, after being pursued and suppressed by the National Army, are now dividing into groups in an attempt to cross the Xiang River surreptitiously. Their Jianghan Independent Brigade crossed the Dongjing River from Laoxinkou on the 25th and scattered in all directions, appearing to be fleeing towards Chang Lake (north of Shashi). As for the main force of Liu's 1st Column, they are still constructing fortifications around the city of Runan County, attempting to resist stubbornly. The 7th Brigade of bandits, which attempted to invade Qianshan Yuezhai, was blocked by the National Army and has fled towards Wangjiapa樓. The 3rd Column of bandits, which failed to attack Lihuang, has also fled southeast.

<h3>Wang Kuang, Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau, Discusses China's Shipping Administration</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Wang Kuang, Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau, stated: "Before the war, China's shipping industry was jointly operated by Chinese and foreign merchants. There were approximately 1.4 million tons of merchant ships on inland rivers and along the coast, of which only 576,000 tons belonged to Chinese merchants. There were heavy losses during the War of Resistance. At the time of victory, only 457 Yangtze River steamers, totaling 80,800 tons, remained. All ocean-going vessels were lost. After the victory, efforts were made to revive the industry. Currently, there are 950,000 tons of merchant ships, including 1,179 ocean-going vessels and 2,138 river vessels. The Yangtze River trunk line has now restored 60-70% of its pre-war shipping capacity, and all other inland river routes have been fully restored. Supply and demand are still able to meet. What is gratifying to us is that inland river shipping rights have been recovered, coastal trade is entirely operated by Chinese merchants, and the number of ocean-going routes has increased from one (Manila) before the war to eight, namely Hong Kong, Vietnam, Siam, Guam, India, Japan, Singapore, and Manila. The largest Chinese merchant ship before the war was only 8,000 tons, but now there are Liberty ships of over 10,000 tons. Previously, crew members relied mainly on experience, but now they are able to absorb new knowledge and use new equipment, and their quality is gradually improving. In the coming year, the number of merchant ships can be further increased. The Minsheng Company has ordered 11 new Yangtze River steamers from Canada and 6 ocean-going vessels from the United Kingdom, all with modern air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has ordered 15 Liberty ships and 15 ocean-going vessels from the United States, and the Ministry of Communications has also purchased 120,000 tons of surplus ships from the United States to compensate for the wartime losses of private shipping companies. Furthermore, 350 ships of the Executive Yuan's Shipping Brigade can all be operated under the Chinese flag in the future. It is estimated that next year, China's ships can reach 1.5 million tons, restoring the total tonnage of Chinese and foreign merchant ships to the pre-war level."</p>

<h3>Severe Coal Shortage in Changchun; Soybean Cake Temporarily Used as Fuel</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun Dispatch, 28th] The issue of power generation in Changchun City has become increasingly serious. Due to the lack of coal, the electricity bureau has been burning soybean cake for power generation since the 25th. However, the amount of soybean cake required is huge, using 100 tons per day, and it can only maintain electricity supply to a small number of important institutions and just over a hundred food processing businesses. A survey conducted by the city government within two days froze 1,200 tons of soybean cake stored by businesses throughout the city, but this can only maintain power generation for half a month. If power generation is stopped due to fuel shortage, then food processing will only be possible using primitive methods in the future. The authorities are now not only strongly encouraging the use of traditional methods of rice milling, but also mobilizing the technical personnel of the city government and the Scientific and Technical Association to start researching and manufacturing animal-powered rice milling machines.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Stuart Discusses Sino-American Relations; China Aid Plan to Be Proposed in Congress Next Month; Constitutional Government Is the Beginning of China's Bright Future</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] Ambassador Leighton Stuart answered various questions from reporters at the request of the alumni welcoming party at Yanjing University on the 28th:</p>
<p>Q: How does the Ambassador believe that China's domestic problems can be resolved?</p>
<p>A: Peace talks are not easy, and war is not easy to defeat either side, so a solution will be sought through external factors.</p>
<p>Q: What do you mean by "external factors"?</p>
<p>A: The United States is currently planning a solution to the problem, which may be proposed in Congress next January. However, this problem may not be solved by the United States alone and requires the cooperation of other countries.</p>
<p>Q: Why is the amount of China aid loans that the United States will approve so small? Will there be an amount that can satisfy China's hopes in the future?</p>
<p>A: The importance is not the size of the numbers, but that it proves that Americans are paying attention to the China problem. At the same time, because some people in the United States believe that there are many corrupt and incompetent officials in the Chinese government, the use of the loan must be considered.</p>
<p>Q: What effect will economic aid have on the Chinese war situation?</p>
<p>A: It may prolong the war.</p>
<p>Q: Will the United States abandon China?</p>
<p>A: The United States wants to solve the European problem first. Ambassador Stuart added that he is not pessimistic about the China problem. As long as there is patience and hard work, there will be a bright future. China has begun to implement constitutional government, which is the beginning of a bright future. However, it requires the joint efforts of leaders at all levels to be successful.</p>
<h3>General Lucas Recalled; Related to China Aid Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] It is learned today that General Lucas, the head of the U.S. military advisory group in China, has been recalled immediately.

<h3>Rationing of Goods and Price Controls; Ministry of Economic Affairs Drafts Two Plans; To Be Proposed for Discussion at the First Annual National Economic Conference</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently drafted two plans based on the implementation measures of the economic reform program: (A) Plan for the rationing of goods to public employees, including not only general public employees but also legally registered cultural workers and teachers in private secondary schools and above. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is responsible for the rationing of fuel and cooking oil, the Cereal Department is responsible for the rationing of food, the Ministry of Finance is responsible for the rationing of salt, and the China Textile Corporation is responsible for the rationing of cloth.

<h3>Salary Adjustment Based on Index; Special Review Committee of the National Government Committee to Discuss on the 31st</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Starting next year, the salaries of public employees will be paid based on the cost of living index. The plan drafted by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has been reviewed by the Special Review Committee of the National Government Committee and has been initially approved. The committee will reconvene on the 31st for further discussion. The method is to subtract the base figure of 20 yuan from the base salary, multiply by a percentage, then add the base figure of 20 yuan, and then multiply by the cost of living index, which equals the salary due. The percentages are set at 15% for those below 300 yuan and 10% for those above 300 yuan. This is equivalent to paying 21 yuan according to the cost of living index for the base figure of 20 yuan, paying 21 yuan plus 15% according to the cost of living index for those earning 300 yuan, and paying 21 yuan plus 10% according to the cost of living index for those earning 400 yuan. The characteristic is that, according to Chairman Chiang's instructions, more is added to those with lower salaries and less is added to those with higher salaries. As for the cost of living index, it is set at 66,800 times for January next year.</p>
<h3>Government's Unified Purchase of Raw Cotton Still Faces Many Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Regarding the government's determination to implement the unified purchase of raw cotton, authoritative sources say that implementation is likely to encounter difficulties in the future. According to accurate statistics, based on the amount of cotton purchased domestically by private manufacturers in the past year, at least 17 trillion yuan will be needed next year. If the government is to control everything completely, it can only be maintained for three months, after which difficulties will arise. Therefore, according to his observation, the implementation of the unified purchase of raw cotton still needs to be studied.</p>

The "University Law" and the "College Law" are both legislation concerning higher education. There have been few changes in the university system. At the time of the implementation of the Constitution, the government, in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution, re-established the legal system for higher education and promulgated its implementation. This is indeed a matter worthy of attention from the academic and educational communities.</p>
<p>Our universities originated earliest and have the longest history in the world. However, the ancient universities, such as the Imperial College and the Imperial Academy, had different systems from modern European and American universities. The origin of our modern universities began in the 21st year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty (1895) when Sheng Xuanhuai requested the establishment of a Chinese and Western School in Tianjin. The following year, Li Duanfen established a university hall in Beijing. In the 24th year of the Guangxu reign, the Imperial University of Peking was established, which was the earliest national university in our country. Although Tongwen Guan was established in the first year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty before this time, its teaching purpose was only to cultivate translators, and its language proficiency only reached the level of Western primary and secondary schools, so it could not be called university education. After the founding of the Republic, the school system was revised, and higher education was divided into university institutes, universities, higher normal schools, and specialized schools, each divided into undergraduate and preparatory courses. In the eleventh year of the Republic, the school system was reformed, influenced by new educational ideas, and it was stipulated that specialized universities could be established, and universities would implement a elective system. Thus, the face of higher education in our country was renewed. When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the University Organization Law was promulgated in the eighteenth year of the Republic, and the school system gradually became established. Higher education was divided into three types: universities, independent colleges, and specialized schools. Universities and independent colleges could establish graduate schools, and at the same time, the preparatory courses were abolished. Public and private schools established according to this school system have increased and adjusted annually. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, normal colleges were added to specifically train teachers for secondary schools. In terms of the development history of our higher education, school facilities, and domestic environment, our university system is still in its early stages and needs to be improved and enriched to meet the needs of the new era.</p>
<p>The current legislation of the "University Law" and the "College Law" stipulates that higher education institutions are divided into three types: universities, independent colleges (University Law), and specialized schools (College Law), which is the same as the old school system of the 18th year [of the Republic], and the organization of higher education institutions in the United States in this century is also largely similar. Other matters, such as the administrative organization of the school, the appointment procedures for presidents, deans, department heads, professors, associate professors, etc., and the regulations for various university meetings, generally either follow the old practices or are newly stipulated. Among them, the most noteworthy points are the main purpose of the university, the university system, the qualifications for student admission, and the establishment of provincial and municipal universities. I would like to briefly discuss them here:</p>
<p>1. Establishment of the Main Purpose of the University: The main purpose of the university is the basic spirit of the university, also known as Laski's "function of the university." The main purpose of our universities in the former Qing Dynasty was to correct trends and cultivate generalists. In the first year of the Republic, it was changed to teaching advanced academics, nurturing great scholars and adapting to national needs. The University Organization Law of July of the 18th year [of the Republic] stipulated that "universities should follow the educational purpose of the Republic of China and its implementation policies, to study advanced academics and cultivate specialized talents." The current "University Law" stipulates that "universities, in accordance with Article 158 of the Constitution of the Republic of China, aim to study advanced academics and cultivate specialized talents." Article 158 of the Constitution stipulates: "Education and culture should develop the national spirit, the spirit of self-government, national morality, sound physique, science, and life skills of the people." This stipulates the basic spirit of establishing the country through education and culture. It can be seen that according to the provisions of this article of the Constitution, the universities we expect not only aim to cultivate specialized talents with advanced academics, but also should instill in university intelligence the promotion of the national spirit and the spirit of self-government, and the cultivation of democratic thought and a sound physique. In the world's educational trends, this law has clearly expressed the meaning of promoting national culture and democratic thought. We are very displeased with the current universities, which seem to only sell some superficial specialized skills, while neglecting how to teach students to be truly excellent citizens who can govern themselves and love their country. Moreover, the original article of the Constitution did not stipulate that the main purpose of the university is to cultivate "specialized talents." Whether the university should cultivate "generalists" or "specialists" is a controversial issue. Now that the university has made a rigid stipulation, whether it is suitable for modern trends and our national conditions still seems to be a matter worth considering.</p>
<p>2. Regulations on the University System: Legislation focuses on flexible application, especially legislation on culture and education, and should not be rigidly prescribed. The current university system in our country is originally divided into eight colleges: arts, sciences, law, commerce, agriculture, engineering, medicine, and education. Those with three or more colleges are called universities, and those that do not meet the conditions are called independent colleges. Three colleges must have one of the colleges of science, agriculture, engineering, or medicine. Specialized schools are divided into agriculture, engineering, medicine, and other categories. Graduate schools must have three graduate institutes, each with several departments. The current legislation takes a more flexible approach to the university system, focusing on practical application. The university regulations stipulate that universities are divided into colleges of arts, sciences, law, medicine, agriculture, commerce, and other colleges. Normal colleges should be established separately by the state, and national universities can also be affiliated. Those with three or more colleges are called universities, and those that do not meet the conditions are called independent colleges. The subject is not rigidly stipulated, which takes into account the development of the university's functions. The subject categories of specialized schools are also not rigidly stipulated, which emphasizes the practicality of higher education. The establishment of graduate institutes is limited to universities or independent colleges with well-run and excellent academic departments, regardless of whether they are public or private, and is not limited to the establishment of several departments. The legislation is realistic and helpful to the development of university graduate institutes, which is no small matter, and is a great improvement compared to the past.</p>
<p>3. Relaxation of Admission Qualifications: The old university system in our country had stricter regulations on student admission qualifications, which is not in line with the spirit of the country and the school's teaching. During the third reading of the "University Law" in the Legislative Yuan, there was a heated debate for an hour on whether students with equivalent abilities should be allowed to be admitted before it was passed. According to Article 26 of the University Law: "The qualifications for admission to a university should be graduation from a public or registered private senior high school or equivalent school, or having equivalent academic ability, and passing the entrance examination." Article 19 of the College Law stipulates: "Those admitted to a college should have graduated from a public or registered private senior high school, or have equivalent academic ability, and have passed the entrance examination." This kind of relaxation gives self-taught students the opportunity to take the entrance examination for universities and colleges. The spirit of the legislation is fair, symbolizing that the gates of higher education will never be protected by a special minority, and the right to university education will be shared by young students who are eager to learn and make progress. We cannot help but deeply congratulate the general students who are poor but ambitious.</p>
<p>4. The Trend of University Regionalization: The distribution of universities in our country is geographically chaotic, with multiple universities located in the same area, and there is no reasonable division of labor among the universities. This is a waste on the one hand and lopsided on the other. Educational scholars in our country have long advocated the adjustment and regionalization. According to the provisions of the University Law and the College Law, the Ministry of Education has the right to examine the situation of national universities (colleges) in various places. At the same time, public universities are divided into three types: national, provincial, and municipal. The trend of regional establishment is already implied in the legislation, which is very necessary.</p>
<p>In short, the new higher education system is more progressive in legislation than before. If there can be good measures in administration in the future, university education in our country can gradually reach an ideal state. However, we want to point out that perfect school administration and organization are only the perfection of the body and form of the university, while the establishment of a new academic style is the soul of university education. Today, for university education in our country, the school system should be improved and enriched, and the promotion and cultivation of a new academic style is even more important than the establishment of the university system. After reviewing the new university system legislation, we hope that the education authorities and educators can pay attention to the promotion of the national spirit of establishing the country through culture and education!</p>

<p>Wang Lanseng Withdraws from the Election</p>
<p>[City News] Youth Party Legislative Yuan candidate Wang Lanseng has announced his withdrawal from the election. According to Wang, he originally intended to be nominated in the Fifth District of his native Jiangsu, but after the Nationalist Party and the Youth Party negotiated nominations, the Nationalist Party Central Committee changed his nomination to the Eastern District Industry and Mining Organization. Since he is not an employee of the industry and mining sector, he did not want to participate in the industry and mining sector's election. He then submitted this to the Central Committee of the Party for approval and withdrew from the Legislative Yuan election.</p>

<h3>Soviet Domination of Greece Controls the Straits, U.S. and Britain are Consulting on Countermeasures, U.S. Military Aid to Greece Should be More Important Than Economic Aid</h3>
<p>[United Press Washington 27th Dispatch] Washington, 27th: A very important talk between British and American officials will begin here after Monday. Monday is the day the British cabinet meets to discuss the policies Britain should take towards the leftist government of Greece under Markos's leadership. Opinions have been exchanged here to decide whether Britain and the United States should send letters to Hungary, Romania, and Albania to inquire about the size of each government's forces and equipment. Britain and the United States are making this inquiry in accordance with the terms stipulated in the peace treaty.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 28th] The New York Times' Washington correspondent said that the idea of immediately increasing US military aid to Greece is becoming more concrete. Due to recent developments, responsible officials at the State Department believe not only that economic and military aid to Greece must continue after the existing aid program ends on June 30, 1948, but also that special emphasis should be placed on military aid. The Greek Communist Party's intensified armed rebellion and the Communist Party's establishment of a "provisional democratic government" clearly necessitate a re-examination of the US policy toward Greece.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] Former Democratic Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bloom, said that the recent developments in Greece do not mean that the United States' efforts to repel Greek communism have failed. "Without the aid program to Greece, communism would have swept through all of Greece today. Once that group steps in, it is almost impossible to drive them out. It is better to spend one dollar to prevent them from entering than to spend five hundred dollars to drive them out. We cannot withdraw. This is not a fifteen-round boxing match, but a very intense struggle. We must win, otherwise, God help us. That's all I have to say. In the future, the Soviet Union will covet Turkey and the Dardanelles Strait, Egypt, and the Suez Canal."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York, 27th] The establishment of a communist government in northern Greece is another important strategy of the Soviet Union's determination to control the Dardanelles Strait, because establishing the Soviet Union as a major Mediterranean power is the dream of generations of Tsars. Greece is located to the west of the strait, so it is a powerful base for defending the strait. Since the Greeks are participating in the Western democratic camp, Greece is a barrier to protecting the status quo of the strait. If the Soviet Union wants to dominate Greece and then control the strait, the Greek monarchical government is fighting hard against the Communist Party. If the monarchical government collapses, a communist government will inevitably arise, becoming a vassal of Moscow. At that time, the Soviet Union will inevitably re-oppress Turkey to accept the demand for joint management of the straits.</p>
<h3>Short-Term British-Soviet Trade Agreement Signed in Moscow, Soviets Exchange Rough Rice for British Goods</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 27th] The British-Soviet trade agreement was signed tonight at Spiridonovka Palace, the site of the 1945 Tripartite Foreign Ministers' Meeting. British Ambassador Bedell Smith represented the British side, and Soviet Minister of Foreign Trade Mikoyan represented the Soviet side.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] It was announced here today that the short-term trade agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union was signed in Moscow on the 27th. Under the agreement, Britain can obtain 750,000 tons of rough rice from the Soviet Union, which can be shipped from Black Sea ports in early January. Britain will supply the Soviet Union with industrial equipment that can be provided immediately. The equipment requested by the Soviet Union from Britain includes sawing machinery, transportation machinery, heavy-duty motors, mobile generators, and civil engineering machinery. The agreement also includes the terms for the Soviet Union to repay the 1941 British credit loan to the Soviet Union. According to a British Department of Commerce spokesperson, negotiations on a long-term British-Soviet trade agreement lasting several years will be held next May, at which time wheat and lumber will also be the subject of negotiations. According to this agency's financial reporter, Campbell, the signing of the short-term British-Soviet trade agreement was slightly later than expected, but purely for technical reasons. This agreement is mainly based on the Soviet Union's exchange of rough rice for British machinery. Britain has also made some concessions regarding the 1941 credit loan agreement. The short-term British-Soviet trade agreement itself is not very important, because the rough rice that the Soviet Union will supply to Britain under the agreement is only 750,000 tons, which is only one-third of the wheat ordered by Britain from Australia, but several developments since British Minister of Commerce Wilson established the agreement with the Soviet Union in Moscow are of particular importance. The Soviet Union established and published the agreement on the eve of implementing its currency reform, which shows that the Soviet Union believes that this connection with Britain is sufficient to strengthen the Soviet Union's internal economy.</p>
<h3>Security Council Figures Watch Greek Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, 27th] Security Council figures say that unless Greece's northern neighbors formally recognize the new government established by the Greek guerrillas in the north of the country, the Security Council will continue to regard the matter as an internal affair. Security Council figures also said that they do not yet know whether the Athens government intends to formally complain to the Security Council about Yugoslavia and Albania's assistance to the Greek rebels. The Security Council is scheduled to hold its final meeting of the year on the 2nd of the next period, and the three member states of Brazil, Australia, and Poland will also step down at the meeting on Tuesday, to be succeeded by the three new member states of Argentina, Canada, and Ukraine. A major event on the Security Council's agenda is the Indonesian issue, but a debate on the Palestinian issue will be held in early January next year.</p>
<h3>Passed Away in Egypt</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reports] London 28th Broadcast: Alexandria News: Former Egyptian King Ahmed Fouad II has died of heart disease today at the age of seventy-eight. The former king abdicated and left for Egypt in 1946.</p>
<h3>French Government Decides to Increase Wages, Plans to Compromise with the Labor Sector, The Upper Classes in France Oppose Schumann's Measures</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 27th] It was learned on the 27th that the Schumann government has reportedly decided to increase workers' monthly salaries by 2,000 francs in order to compromise with the labor sector, but the upper and middle classes and both houses of the French parliament are increasingly opposed to its economic reform plan.</p>
<p>At the same time, a rare phenomenon occurred in the National Assembly, that is, a motion put forward by Communist Party members to reject the decision to increase the price of cigarettes manufactured by state-owned factories by ten francs was unanimously passed. It has been less than a week since the government announced the price increase. It is reported that the Senate, which usually only passes legislation from the lower house as a matter of course, is now prepared to obstruct Finance Minister René Mayer's taxation plan. The National Assembly has already cut billions of francs from the government's budget of 150 billion francs, and continued to cut 9 billion on the 27th. The wage increase rate decided by the cabinet will be announced on the 28th. This increase is said to be a victory for Finance Minister Mayer over Labor Minister Mayer, because the latter advocated increasing cost-of-living allowances.</p>
<h3>French Parliament Passes the First Part of the Budget</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 27th] The French National Assembly today passed the first part of the budget proposed by Finance Minister Mayer by a show of hands. Technically speaking, this first part postpones the use of the 348 billion francs in the 1947 ordinary administrative budget to 1948, pending the passage of the entire budget.</p>
<h3>Bao Dai Secretly Arrives in Bangkok</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 27th] Former Annamese King Bao Dai was a guest at the Christmas dinner given by French personnel here. Bao Dai arrived here secretly from Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 24th with three attendants.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Konitsa Highway, Greek Government Forces Reinforce, Air Force Bombs Strategic Strongholds</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 27th] A dispatch from the front line today said that government reinforcements destroyed 67 important strongholds of the guerrillas tonight and inflicted heavy casualties. In an attempt to open the highway to the city of Konitsa, 44,000 refugees could not stand the harassment of the communist army's attacks with 66mm caliber artillery and fled. The Epirus Plateau is covered with snow. Under the cover of night, government troops carrying heavy weapons arrived at the scene, preparing to launch a general offensive at dawn.</p>
<p>The fighting is in full swing on the entire line of the highway from the north of Kalbaki to Ioannina and Konitsa. There is also fierce fighting near the Konitsa-Voulocheri bridge. If the government forces want to break through the guerrilla encirclement, this gateway is essential. Although isolated, the Konitsa government forces are still holding on. After commander Doufas was injured and hospitalized, he still issued travel orders from his bed, repelling six major offensives by the communist army. At the same time, government aircraft have also participated in the battle, destroying two guerrilla artillery positions only two and a half miles from the Albanian border. The first part of the budget proposed by Minister Mayer will be postponed for the use of 348 billion in the ordinary administrative budget of 1947 to 1948, pending the passage of the entire budget.</p>
<h3>Judd Discusses World Situation, Advocates Aid to China</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lawrence, Kansas, 28th United Press] US Congressman Judd recently said that the people of European countries under Soviet control are praying for war to end Soviet enslavement. Mr. Zhou addressed the opening ceremony of the Christian Front Student Conference. He also said that there are currently two worlds, one controlled by the Soviet Union and the other controlled by Western countries. Zhun said that we cannot survive in two worlds for long, so we must seek unity through conquest or agreement. This unity can be achieved through dictatorship or through alliances.</p>
<p>He listed what he called the four most critical locations in today's world: Germany, whose problem lies in the relationship between Germany and other countries, and what kind of power it will become itself. The countries around Germany, whose people are praying for war to end Soviet enslavement. The Pacific, Mr. Zhou pointed out, the United States is implementing a Western policy, that is, on the one hand, it is aiding Europe to resist communism, and in Asia it is stopping aid until all of China is controlled by the Communist Party. The United States' problem should be how to use its vast resources and power.</p>
<h3>De Gaulle Leads the French Youth Party, Non-Communist Workers Plan to Form New Unions</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] Right-wing followers of De Gaulle announced today the formation of the French Youth Party, the second major development in French politics in 1947. The first was the split of the French trade unions, with former Secretary General of the General Confederation of Labor, Ishikawa, leading a million workers to form an anti-communist "Workers' Army." Both of these organizations arose as a result of the major strikes in recent months. The Youth Party is initially no different from other youth groups in France, but its size and leadership by De Gaulle are significant. Organizers say branches are already being organized in nine out of ten regions nationwide.</p>
<h3>Major Congressional Agenda in the US Next Year, Aid to Europe is the Main Theme, Republican Leader Taft Talks</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] Republican Senate Leader Taft said on the 27th that President Truman's $17 billion aid plan for Europe is the major agenda facing Congress next year. It is said that the Republican plan on important domestic issues (such as tax cuts and government spending cuts) must wait for Congress to take action on the European aid plan.</p>
<p>Taft, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, also listed the following issues as major issues for the coming year, namely: the issue of Summer Islands joining the United States as a state of the United States, increasing the efficiency of the State Department's foreign intelligence program, and military assistance to Latin American countries.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] Democratic Senator Johnson declared today that the United States can aid foreign countries $2.16 billion in one year without affecting the domestic economy or causing a shortage crisis. If this amount is exceeded, strict organizational and price controls will be required, so foreign aid plans must be drawn up on a year-by-year basis.</p>
<h3>Britain's Remaining US Loan is Only Enough to Sustain it for Three Months</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 27th] Washington officials say that the remaining portion of Britain's US loan totaling $3.75 billion will be exhausted within ninety days. Financial officials from the two countries are studying how to sustain Britain until the implementation of the Marshall Plan. They fear that the current political situation in the United States, especially due to the upcoming presidential election, may cause other debates that will prevent the European aid legislation from being completed before March 31.</p>
<h3>On the Eve of the Peace Conference, a Coalition Cabinet is Needed, Katayama Expresses Support for the Crisis to the End</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Prime Minister Katayama attended the general meeting of the Japan Newspaper Reporters League held at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 27th and emphasized that a coalition cabinet based on the motherland is needed before the peace conference. The current cabinet will take on the current situation to the end. Its main points: Since the tripartite coalition cabinet is organized, the tripartite coalition should be strengthened to rebuild the motherland. The new party's movement being carried out lacks clear principles and policies and is not enough to achieve great power. To break through the crisis, it is not appropriate to actively implement socialist policies immediately, but to gradually implement them. However, he hopes to convene a peace conference as soon as possible, and its preparations have been stated many times. The cabinet's advance and retreat should be based on clear principles and policies, determined by the number of people in the Diet. If the general will of the Diet representing the people supports the current cabinet, I intend to take on the difficult situation and break through the crisis to the end.</p>

<h3>A Sea of Fire North of the Mud City Bridge, the Agricultural Goods Market Reduced to Ashes, Extinguished After Three Hours of Firefighting, Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The agricultural goods market behind the Szechuen Road North Four Bank Warehouse (i.e., the Central Market established by the puppet regime), caught fire yesterday afternoon around 12:30 PM. The fire burned for three and a half hours, and more than 150 sheds inside the market were completely destroyed. Fire departments from the Central, New [City name], Hongkou districts, and the Zhabei National Defense Fire Brigade, totaling more than 20 fire engines, were dispatched to the scene, drawing water from both land and water to extinguish the fire. The origin of the fire was traced to an employee named Zhang Ming of the Yu Sheng Agricultural Goods Store at number 65 in the market. At the time the fire started, the room was empty and the windows and doors were tightly closed. Therefore, once the flames broke through the roof, the situation was already beyond control. Employees of the Chang Chang Agricultural Goods Store at number 67 next door discovered the fire and tried several times to open the door, but were unsuccessful. In an instant, the fire spread to the surrounding areas. When firefighters arrived at the scene, the inside of the market had already become a sea of fire, spreading from the northwest to the southeast. The area along the Mud City Bridge was completely covered in thick black smoke. After firefighters made every effort to rescue the scene and control the overall situation, dividing it into two fire fronts, the fire was finally contained at around 3:00 PM. By 4:00 PM, it was completely extinguished. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. Whether it was caused by carelessness while cooking remains to be investigated by the Zhabei Police Department. The fire ground was littered with Chinese cabbage, sweet potatoes, salted meat, Shaoxing wine, and other goods. It is reported that over 10,000 dan of Chinese cabbage alone were destroyed, resulting in heavy losses, the extent of which is difficult to estimate at this time. When the fire was raging, police officers maintaining order at the scene apprehended a thief, Zhu Liangchen from Taizhou, who was taking advantage of the fire. They also confiscated stolen goods such as silk cotton blankets, scarves, and woolen sweaters. The person and the stolen goods were taken to the police station. At that time, traffic in the area, from the Mud City Bridge to Xinjiang Road and Mongolia Road, was completely cut off, and did not return to normal until 4:00 PM. Fire starter Qu Yiming, and witnesses Du Cailiang, Zhang Fengjin, and others have been summoned to the police station for questioning. (The picture below shows the scene of the fire, photographed by our newspaper)</p>
<h3>Automatic Adjustment of Public Utilities: Implementation Date Not Yet Determined</h3>
<p>Regarding the implementation of the automatic adjustment method for public utilities, our reporter visited Mr. Zhao [Name illegible], Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, to inquire about the details. He said the following:</p>
<p>The automatic adjustment method for public utilities was approved by the National Economic Commission and serves as a national standard for determining prices for general public utilities. The method has also been issued to this city.</p>
<p>The Bureau takes the application of this method very seriously and is currently studying several key factors in the method, such as the increase or decrease in the cost of living index, foreign exchange rates, and fuel prices, to ensure that its application is practical.</p>
<p>The cost of living index for this month will be announced at the end of the month, and whether there will be any changes in fuel prices next month is currently unknown. Therefore, whether the automatic adjustment method can be implemented on New Year's Day of the 37th year [1948] is currently uncertain. Mr. Zhao continued, stating that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is responsible for supervising various public utilities related to people's livelihoods. On the one hand, it must consider the maintenance of each public utility, and on the other hand, it must also consider the burden on citizens. To respect public opinion, the Municipal Government has decided to invite members of the Municipal Council to attend meetings and solicit opinions before implementing this method.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Alumni of the Central Military Academy Welcome Generals Du and Chen</h3>

<h3>Tao Baichuan and Wu Shaoshu to Resign from the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] Municipal Councilor Tao Baichuan has been elected as a member of the Control Yuan. However, according to central government regulations, members of the Control Yuan cannot concurrently serve as municipal councilors. Therefore, according to Mr. Tao, he will resign from his position as a municipal councilor within the next two or three days. After his resignation, Bao [Name illegible] Sheng, a substitute councilor from the fifteenth district, will succeed him. Mr. Bao is 57 years old, a native of Shanghai, and currently serves as the managing director and general manager of the Yizhong Cotton Textile Factory Co., Ltd., and as a managing director of the East China Enterprise Company, among other positions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Municipal Councilor Wu Shaoshu from the seventh district has been appointed as a legislator by the central government and, according to law, cannot concurrently serve as a municipal councilor. Therefore, Mr. Wu will also resign from his position as a municipal councilor. The vacant position should be filled by substitute councilor Zhu Bulan.

He currently serves as the chairman of the Yanghang Rice Milling and Oil Pressing Co., Ltd.</p>
<h3>Religious Believers Form an Alliance, Willing to Continue to Fulfill Great Aspirations</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] Li Yujie, Secretary-General of the Chinese Religious Believers' Peace and National Reconstruction Grand Alliance, recently spoke about the fact that the public often confuses the Alliance with the Chinese Religious Believers' Fellowship Association, stating: "The Religious Believers' Fellowship Association was founded during the Anti-Japanese War by Master Taixu, General Bai Chongxi, Bishop Yu Bin, and others in Chongqing, according to the regulations of the People's Organizations. Its purpose was to break down barriers, connect emotions, and jointly save the country. The Religious Believers' Peace and National Reconstruction Grand Alliance was initiated at the end of the 35th year [1946] by religious believers of various different natures, aiming to unite religious forces, participate in politics with the spirit of peaceful struggle, and fulfill the great aspiration of saving the world. It is purely a transcendental religious political party in China. At this time of national crisis, domestic peace and cooperation have temporarily ended in disappointment. However, the Alliance still pays close attention to the realities of the crisis and the suffering of the people with a compassionate heart. Now that the country is implementing a constitution and political parties are being opened up, the Alliance will, in the future, take an opposition stance and work with domestic and foreign political factions and all progressive forces within the scope of peace and legality to continue to work for peace, save the world, and rebuild the country."</p>

<h3>Preparing to Dredge the Divine Shoal, Starting to Measure the Water Level</h3>
<p>The Divine Shoal in the South Channel of the Yangtze River estuary has been neglected for years, and its summit depth, at its lowest water level, is only 18 feet. Even during minor floods and high tides, it is sometimes only 25 to 26 feet. Its shallow area stretches for as long as 20 miles, and has long been a major obstacle to the entry of large ocean-going vessels. The Shanghai Dredging Bureau, to develop port affairs and facilitate navigation, previously drafted a new plan for dredging the Divine Shoal and submitted it to the Ministry of Finance. As soon as it is approved, work can begin. It is learned that, to coordinate the implementation of the above work, the Bureau specially dispatched Jin Shizhong, head of the Hydrology Section, along with surveyors on the Lijian steamship last week to begin surveying the area.

<h3>Cartloads of Bones on Parade Scare the Hell Out of People: Over Ten Thousand Students from Universities and Middle Schools Raise Money for Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] More than ten thousand students from over eighty universities and middle schools in this city made use of their holiday yesterday to carry out a city-wide expanded fundraising campaign for winter clothing to assist the government's winter relief efforts. The results were satisfactory. According to preliminary estimates, the total amount raised yesterday, in addition to the 23,000+ items of winter clothing and over 200 million yuan in cash collected by Tongji, Jiaotong, St. John's, Soochow, and Zhijiang Universities, all other schools' clothing and money donations, together with the amount of clothing and money raised by each school since the self-initiated fundraising campaign began, are being sorted and tallied overnight and will be officially announced as soon as possible. The general liaison station for fundraising by various schools was set up at the Medical College of Tongji University on Shanzhong Road, and five sub-stations were set up in the northern, southern, southwestern, and northwestern districts at the law school of Tongji, Aurora, Jiaotong, and [School name], respectively, as resting and transfer points. Tongji, Jiaotong, and other schools dispatched seven propaganda vehicles and several roving clothing collection vehicles, which traveled non-stop throughout the urban area. Tongji's propaganda vehicle carried a skeleton used for teaching purposes by the school's medical college, dressed in ragged clothing, with the words "I am also a human being" written on it. Its emaciated appearance was shocking. Students who were dispatched to fundraise wore white cloth V-shaped symbols with the words "Help the Hungry and Cold." From morning to dusk, they traveled everywhere in the cold wind. Stations, theaters, dance halls, restaurants, and other public places and busy streets were all populated by male and female students. Many people were willing to donate generously after being persuaded with heartfelt words. According to the presidium of the joint conference of the Winter Clothing Fundraising Committee of Tongji and the other four universities and the persons in charge of the fundraising committees of each school, the winter clothing donated by each school will be concentrated and distributed in a unified manner around New Year's Day after several days of sorting to ensure that hundreds of thousands of refugees receive practical assistance in their urgent need. In the next few days, they will strengthen the investigation and visitation of refugees in various districts and formulate plans to encourage future fundraising based on the results of the investigation. They also stated that "Modern Chinese literary writers must recognize the international environment, the national conditions of our country, and the needs of the times and the people, and issue the true voices of our Chinese compatriots suffering in the current internal turmoil, create spiritual nourishment that will benefit the thinking and lives of the people, so that the people can be relieved of their suffering as soon as possible, and the country can restore peace and unity as soon as possible, so as not to betray the sacred mission of modern writers. I sincerely wish my colleagues a happy opening of the pen in the New Year, grasp new writing goals, establish new writing styles, create new literary works, and develop new literary undertakings." Subsequently, the vice chairman of the Cultural and Sports Association delivered a speech, Wang Jinshan, the executive director, reported on the association's affairs, and Gu Yiqiao and others gave academic speeches. The entertainment included Kunqu opera by Tang Jingshen, Qian Huafo, Liu [Name illegible], and others, jokes by Xu Zhuodai, recitations by Shen [Name illegible] Li and others, and music, songs, and Peking opera.

<h3>"Singing, Speaking, and Entering Doors": Students Raise Money for Winter Clothing, Earning Widespread Sympathy</h3>
<p>[Special Report from This Newspaper] Cold winds carrying ice and snow have already visited this prosperous city. Despite the below-freezing temperatures, the halls of singing and dancing remain brightly lit, and roaring fires burn in the villas of the wealthy. But what we see before our eyes are hundreds of thousands of refugees barely clothed, their lives teetering on the brink of death, shivering in the cold and trembling in the wind and snow. Who has no parents? Who has no children? While government relief efforts are still slow in coming, young, passionate students have risen up. Over the past few days, they have been raising money for winter clothing for the refugees and distributing the clothing. This work, initiated by a few universities, has spread like wildfire throughout Shanghai, radiating boundless warmth and bringing immeasurable comfort to those suffering.</p>
<p>Street Propaganda Vehicles Shout Everywhere</p>
<p>Yesterday, thousands of students from dozens of universities and middle schools sacrificed their weekly holiday to launch a comprehensive fundraising effort. Three-person teams and five-person teams were running around every corner of Shanghai, while propaganda vehicles were shouting on the streets. Piece after piece of old clothing, old shoes, and hats were collected from donors and, after sorting, were transported via sacks, carts, tricycles, and rickshaws to nearby refugee areas for centralized distribution. University students personally visited and investigated the slums, carefully examining the actual conditions of the refugees and distributing the items they needed one by one.</p>
<p>This is a moving scene depicting humanity's great compassion, intertwined with many touching stories.</p>
<p>Many Old Clothes and Pants Pulled Out from Under Beds</p>
<p>One group of students went to a lane in the central district to raise money. They first started singing songs, attracting the attention of people in the houses, and every door and window was opened. At this time, one student stepped forward and gave a loud speech, reporting on the suffering of the refugees and explaining the meaning of their fundraising efforts. Most of the listeners were moved and went to search for old clothes. Some threw them down from the upstairs windows, while others invited them in to collect them. They call this method "Singing, Speaking, and Entering Doors," which they consider one of the most effective fundraising "strategies."</p>
<p>A woman living in the front building pulled out many old clothes and pants, along with odds and ends, from under her bed. Her eleven- or twelve-year-old son, who was very clever and cute, also helped her search. As the fundraisers were about to leave, he suddenly pointed to the wool sweater he was wearing and said to his mother, "Mom, this wool sweater has a hole in it, let me donate it to them too!"</p>
<p>The Girl Was Moved to Tears After Hearing This</p>
<p>In a small family whose walls were covered with many works of art, a young man politely invited the students in for tea and enthusiastically found a fairly good student uniform. He said apologetically, "Because my wife just happened to go out, otherwise I could have found more."</p>
<p>Students raising money on the Zhaofeng Road encountered many local children who enthusiastically helped, voluntarily acting as guides and going door to door to publicize the effort on their behalf. One twelve- or thirteen-year-old girl, initially seeing a group of people approaching, did not know what they were doing and quickly tried to close the door. A fundraising student then said to her, "You are wearing very warm clothes, but there are many children like you who have no clothes to wear and are about to freeze to death." After hearing this, the girl was moved to tears and quickly ran inside, urging her mother to donate many of her own clothes.</p>
<p>The Poorer People Are, the More Generous They Are</p>
<p>Almost without exception, the poorer people are, the more willing they are to feel pity for the poor. Many small business owners and shoemakers generously donated items of clothing that they did not have much of to spare. Even more, several rickshaw pullers were willing to voluntarily transport clothes and bedding, firmly refusing the fares offered by the students.</p>
<p>Conversely, the wealthy elders in large mansions and deep courtyards were not, as one might imagine, able to donate a large amount of material. Often, from behind the windows of closed iron gates, the faces of doormen or servants would appear, saying that the master was not at home and could not donate, asking them to go to another house.</p>
<h3>Wrapped in Rags, Using Old Newspapers as Blankets</h3>
<p>Although they often encountered closed doors and other misunderstandings during the fundraising process, the students' enthusiasm was always admirable. Sometimes they went deep into the night, braving the rain to distribute clothing and bedding, not caring that their own bodies were soaked by the wind and rain. As long as they saw the refugees smiling and accepting their gifts, those wrapped in rags putting on clothes and pants, and those using old newspapers as blankets covering themselves with cotton batting, a smile, a word of thanks, was enough to bring them the greatest comfort.</p>
<h3>The Mayor Expresses Gratification</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Mayor Wu Guozhen attended and addressed a gathering of students from specialized schools and universities in the city yesterday morning. He considered the enthusiasm of the students from various schools in raising money for winter clothing to relieve the refugees to be valuable and expressed his gratification. He said: In order to avoid overlapping fundraising efforts by various schools, he hoped that matters related to winter relief would be handled uniformly. The student community can take more responsibility in research and supervision of winter relief efforts.</p>

Director Yu Bingjian's speech on Memorial Day briefly stated: Although two years of construction have passed since the victory, with a considerable scale, it has not yet fully matched the era of progress and met the needs of the people, nor has it been able to compete with the civilized countries of Europe and the United States. Therefore, in the future, telecommunications traffic should pay more attention to construction and seek its development, such as enriching equipment, adopting new types of machinery, recruiting outstanding talents, improving communication efficiency, further comprehensively expanding, penetrating society, and serving the people even in remote areas. With the improvement of the environment and the allocation of human and material resources, we must rely on the continued efforts of all our colleagues to promote its realization.</p>

<h3>A Perspective on Smuggling in South China</h3>
<p>[Airmail Report from Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 25th] The problem of smuggling in South China, from the time of restoration to today, two years later, still exists and has not been thoroughly resolved. Although the authorities have made the greatest efforts and used all kinds of positive and negative measures, smuggling has not only not been curbed, but has become more serious day by day. According to the recent report from the Guangdong Customs: from May to October of this year, a total of 2,512 smuggling cases were seized in half a year, with a total value of approximately 20 billion yuan. Compared with the four months in the spring of this year, it increased by about six or seven times. The increase in this anti-smuggling figure is certainly a manifestation of the customs' efforts to combat smuggling, but according to the already seized smuggling figures, there is an average of thirteen or fourteen cases per day, with an amount of more than 100 million yuan per day (not including those that have not been seized). From this, one can imagine the alarming figures of our country's tax revenue losses.</p>
<p>The Main Smuggling Locations</p>
<p>are, of course, in Guangzhou. Because Guangzhou is close to Hong Kong and Macau, and the nearby borders of Bin'an and Zhongshan are connected to Hong Kong and Macau, and there are many ports and branches in the Pearl River Delta, there are probably more than one hundred entrances from Hong Kong and Macau to Guangzhou. Smugglers use this geographical advantage, using both land and water routes, making it impossible for anti-smuggling personnel to defend against. Moreover, in addition to a part of the smugglers who are forced by life and carry some smuggled goods as "water passengers" on their own, the rest are all organized smuggling groups. They have considerable capital and special forces to protect them, and even collude with bandits to transport them on their behalf. In addition to setting up seemingly normal and respectable firms in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macau, they also have special personnel stationed at various transportation stations along the route to communicate information through wireless radio. They also have transportation vehicles such as cars and ships, and they are equipped with considerable armed forces. If they encounter anti-smuggling personnel intercepting them, they will first deliver considerable "gifts" to request passage. If they are not accepted, they are always ready to fight. Unless the anti-smuggling personnel also have considerable strength, who would dare to provoke them? They can only watch them drive away and pretend they didn't see them. Therefore, most of the smuggled goods seized by customs anti-smuggling personnel are the aforementioned scattered smuggled goods carried by individuals. There are not many cases of cracking down on large-scale organized smuggling!</p>
<p>According to investigations by relevant parties: Currently, there are thousands of people coming and going every day engaging in small-scale smuggling on trains, highways, and ships, and there are also three or four hundred organized large and small</p>
<p>smuggling groups</p>
<p>that are frequently active on various transportation lines. They usually smuggle in: cosmetics, pigments, caustic soda, bleaching powder, kerosene, salt, cellophane, cigarettes, western medicine, cloth, etc. The main items smuggled out are food rice, cooking oil, and tung oil, which is used to evade foreign exchange settlement. According to investigations by the Office of the Administrative Yuan: in the past month alone, more than 30,000 dan of rice have been exported through Macau. Therefore, Director Song Ziwen was shocked and furious about this matter. Because the province is experiencing a food shortage, some illegal merchants are smuggling food out of the country for profit, which is a betrayal of conscience. Therefore, he ordered the local teams and the naval military police in Zhongshan and the Guangzhou Railway line to assist the anti-smuggling personnel in strict inspections. Those who are caught will be executed. At the same time, he also negotiated with the Macau government to ask for their assistance. Therefore, the general food smugglers have already become subdued.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another type of smuggler who specializes in smuggling industrial raw materials into the country. Most of those who engage in this business are originally legitimate merchants. Because the allocation of import quotas in South China is too small, many legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises receive allocations from the government that are far from their actual needs. For the sake of their own interests, they do not hesitate to take risks, using black market foreign exchange to</p>
<p>Purchase Raw Materials</p>
<p>and smuggle them in. They even join powerful smuggling groups to resist customs inspections. They do not admit that they are smuggling, but say that this is "underground trade." What they mean is that it is not that they are unwilling to pay taxes, but that even if they pay taxes, the government will not allow them to import. Although they say so, in reality they are engaging in smuggling, and most of these merchants have strong capital. They are helping to increase the strength of the smuggling groups, thus making smuggling even more rampant.</p>
<p>The tariff, now Guangzhou, has become a paradise for smugglers. Smuggling has long become an open secret. Mentioning the two words "smuggling," no one will feel strange or surprised. In teahouses, restaurants, and public places, open discussions of smuggling transactions can be heard everywhere. If this widespread bad phenomenon cannot be curbed, the economic future of the entire country will be unimaginable. According to the observations of experienced people: there are approximately several main reasons why smuggling is so rampant: (1) The impact of the war, the people's lives are difficult; (2) Idle funds are concentrated and have no outlet; (3) The currency value is unstable, and the official exchange rate is too low; (4) Trade controls are too strict; it is impossible to obtain a reasonable quantity of raw materials that are actually needed for import.</p>
<p>Of the Four Reasons</p>
<p>, the most pressing issue that needs to be resolved in South China is the last one. If you want to ask how to curb smuggling in South China, Chairman Song Ziwen already has an answer. He reported at the Provincial Assembly this time and said: "Although the Central Government has signed an anti-smuggling agreement with Hong Kong and ordered the Customs and the Navy to strengthen investigations, if the raw materials needed in this province cannot be imported in reasonable quantities, it will be difficult to completely eliminate smuggling. If this province requests an 18% import quota, if approved by the Central Government, smuggling can be immediately prevented." (Special Correspondent Liang Feng)</p>

<h3>Yanzhou and Zaozhuang - A Journey to Southwestern Shandong</h3>
<p>[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 24th by Air] Yanzhou is the military and political center of southwestern Shandong. Li Wangtang, the commander of the Xuyan Pacification Zone, and Peng Guodong, the director of the Southwestern Shandong Administrative Office of the Shandong Provincial Government, are stationed here. Peng is capable, honest, and lives a very simple life. His office contains only a bookshelf and a dilapidated three-drawer desk. The windows are papered, and the cold wind penetrates, making one shiver. I asked him why his life was so simple. He told me, "Simplicity allows us to constantly remember the suffering of the vast number of people who are still in dire straits. It makes us naturally feel their pain and work harder for the people." The administrative office governs five administrative commissioner's offices, totaling thirty counties and 11 million people. The local civilian armed forces in each county are generally larger than those in other parts of the province, with at least a thousand rifles, and as many as ten thousand in counties like Tengxian. Unfortunately, there has been a lack of coordination in the past, and unified command has been lacking, which has often allowed bandits to take advantage and defeat them one by one. The current administrative office plans to establish a joint command for security forces to achieve coordinated cooperation. Commander Li resides in the Catholic Church in the city, which houses the largest organ in East Asia. The western part of the Xuyan section is shielded by lakes such as Zhezhan, Dushan, and Nanyang. As long as the communist bandit Zhang Guangzhong's Shandong Military Region forces near Baodu (north of Zaozhuang) and Feng Zhenwu's forces near Culaishan are thoroughly eliminated, the safety of the Xuyan section can be ensured. Lincheng and Yanzhou are the only two cities on the central section of the Jinpu Railway that have not been captured by the communist bandits. The train stations in both places are relatively intact. Twenty-five kilometers east of Lincheng is a branch line leading to Zaozhuang, but currently, the line only reaches Taozhuang due to military influence. Zaozhuang has been plundered by bandits eight times. The sixteen buildings of the Zhongxing Coal Mine, which originally produced over 8,000 tons of coal per day, as well as the Nandajing and Beidajing mines, have all been completely destroyed by the bandits. Currently, there are over 300 small mines outside the walls that are being mined by locals using indigenous methods. Over 90 of these mines are already producing coal, with a daily output of 1,000 to 1,500 tons. In addition, there are over 30 earthen coke ovens. The livelihood of over 60,000 civilians in the mining area depends on these mines. In Taozhuang, Zhongxing also operated small mines using machinery before the war, but they were also destroyed by the bandits. After Zhongxing sent personnel to repair them four months ago, they can now produce 100 tons per day. Once new machinery arrives, they will be able to produce over 1,000 tons per day. Currently, the small mines are mostly being mined freely by the people. Recently, the Zhongxing Coal Mine Company has received approval to reclaim all the mines starting in January of next year. The most pressing issue for the people of Zaozhuang remains the frequent kidnappings and extortions by bandits due to Zaozhuang's proximity to Zhang Guangzhong's bandit stronghold in Baodu. Therefore, how to particularly strengthen and unify the local armed forces in various places has become the most urgent problem to be solved in Zaozhuang. (Special Correspondent Li Tian)</p>

<h3>Changzhou Plans to Build a Tomb for Unnamed Heroes; Monks at Tianning Temple Economize by Eating Porridge</h3>
<p>[Our Wujin Dispatch on the 27th] In the summer of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), the 67th Division of the National Army and the local underground resistance clashed with the Japanese invaders at Jinji Ba in the west of Puhu. After a day of fierce fighting, many brave and loyal soldiers of our army were killed in action. Their remains and loyal bones were all buried at Jinji Ba. Local people, in order to commemorate the martyrs and comfort their loyal souls, have initiated the construction of a tomb for unnamed heroes to commemorate them forever. The funds will be raised from donations from nearby towns such as Houxu and Xiasi, and laborers will be conscripted. The fundraising and labor budgets are expected to be finalized within the Lunar New Year, and construction will begin on an auspicious day in the coming spring. Also, Tianning Temple in our county is the largest Zen Buddhist temple in Jiangnan, owning a vast amount of farmland, making it the largest landlord in Jiangnan. The monastic buildings are magnificent and grand. Usually, there are about three to four hundred monks residing there, with facilities like a Sutra Library, Buddhist Academy, and Buddhist Hospital, all of which are quite substantial. The sounds of chanting and the ringing of bells and drums fill the air, resembling a Buddhist paradise all year round. However, due to the unrest in the surrounding villages in recent times, it has been difficult to collect rents from all the farmland, which has blocked the monks' food supply. They have been forced to practice economy, switching from eating solid rice to thin porridge to sustain themselves.</p>
<h3>Communist Jin Zhishan Attempts to Open a New Communist Area?</h3>

<h3>Award-Winning College Students of This City Held a Joint Get-Together Yesterday; Speaker Pan and Mayor Wu Both Delivered Speeches; Xinjiang Dance Troupe Participated in the Performance</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee sponsored the first joint get-together of award-winning students from colleges and universities yesterday at 9:00 AM at the Municipal Gymnasium. Mayor Wu, university presidents, guests from all walks of life, representatives of donating organizations, and over two thousand award-winning students from various schools attended (over a thousand more award-winning students were unable to attend due to their participation in yesterday's winter clothing fundraising drive). The Xinjiang Dance Troupe was invited to perform at the gathering. The Central Film Studio dispatched personnel to record news footage.</p>
<h3>Various Sectors Donate Large Sums of Money and Do Not Expect Remuneration</h3>
<p>The meeting was presided over by the chairman of the committee, Municipal Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, who delivered a speech praising the award-winning students as outstanding youths of the nation. Some come from impoverished families, while others have had their economic resources cut off due to banditry in their hometowns, almost forcing them to discontinue their studies. Continuing their studies is of great significance to the nation and their personal futures. Various sectors of the city have generously donated large sums of money for scholarships, hoping that the recipients will make progress in their studies and achieve success, without expecting any remuneration. Their kindness is deeply touching. Pan said: Today, the nation has begun constitutional governance. After the banditry is quelled, political stability can be achieved, and national production and education can both progress. He hopes that the students will study hard at school to build and overcome everything. Pan's words were sincere and won warm applause from the entire audience. Next, Vice-Chairman Li Ximou reported on the scholarship's income and expenditure.</p>
<h3>An Additional 10 Billion Will Be Raised for the Next Term's Scholarship</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu then gave a speech, first stating that the scholarship will continue to be offered next semester, and the total amount to be raised is planned to increase by 10 billion yuan, so that all impoverished students can receive relief. At the same time, based on the experience gained from this semester's implementation, improvements will be made in the technical aspects of fundraising and distribution in the future, and the procedures will be simplified as much as possible to ensure that students at various schools can receive their scholarships before the start of school. If this amount cannot be raised before the start of the next semester, which is before the end of January or early February of next year, the municipal treasury can advance the funds first to achieve timely results. Wu then explained the reasons for the unified fundraising for scholarships, stating that in the past, students from various schools raised funds separately, which scattered their efforts, delayed their studies, and inevitably resulted in uneven distribution and other malpractices. Xie Renzhao from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Huang Jiping from this newspaper (representing donating organizations), Zhu Jingnong, President of Guanghua University, and Ou Yuanhuai, President of Daxia University, then delivered speeches. Zhu and Ou, representing various schools, expressed their gratitude to the donors for the scholarships.</p>
<h3>College Tuition Fees Will Be Discussed at a Meeting Next Month</h3>
<p>[Shenzhou News Agency] Regarding the issue of tuition fees for colleges and universities in this city next semester, over thirty university presidents recently gathered at the Tsinghua Alumni Association and resolved that the unified grant committee will continue to be organized by each school immediately to handle grant matters for each school next semester. As for tuition standards, a meeting will be convened again on January 15 for discussion.</p>
<h3>Meaningful Gatherings Should Be Held Regularly</h3>
<p>Finally, Mo Yanqing, a student at Soochow University, gave a speech of thanks, hoping that scholarships would continue to be offered in the future, and that award-winning students would be closely connected. He stated that this meaningful gathering should be held regularly in the future. After the speech of thanks, entertainment began. After the Yongyan Society performed Kunqu opera, the Xinjiang Dance Troupe performed. The program was wonderful, and the cheers were thunderous. The meeting adjourned at around 1:00 PM. Also, the association distributed 20,000 yuan in snack money to each student at noon yesterday, totaling over 60 million yuan. Upon the suggestion of Fu Tongzeng, a student at Aurora Medical College, the entire group passed a resolution to donate the money to the Winter Relief Committee for the relief of refugees.</p>
<p>[Also Reported] After the meeting yesterday afternoon, the association invited all members of the Xinjiang Dance Troupe to a luncheon on the 14th floor of the International Hotel, where the hosts and guests enjoyed themselves immensely.</p>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] In order to promote audiovisual education, the Ministry of Education has distributed radios to educational departments and bureaus in various provinces and cities and to national schools for application, so as to receive educational broadcasts.

<h3>Qingbaiqing Battles Hard to Defeat Railway by One Goal</h3>
<p>An Upset Almost Occurred in the First Division Football League</p>
<p>In the First Division of the Third Football League, the match between Qingbaiqing and Railway took place at Yiyuan Stadium yesterday at 2:30 PM. A large crowd of spectators, estimated to be over a thousand, watched the game. 20,315 tickets at 20,000 yuan each and 12,949 tickets at 10,000 yuan each were sold, generating an income of 35,790,000 yuan in legal tender. As a result, Qingbaiqing narrowly won by a score of 1-0 after Qu Yongfu scored a goal in the last half minute. The entire 90-minute match was in a state of tension. Railway performed exceptionally well, especially goalkeeper Liao Xiong, who abandoned his usual "pipa style" and made countless saves. On the Qingbaiqing side, Qin Bigao also performed admirably. Wu Qixiang, Yan Yuxin, Meng Yiliang, and others were also quite diligent. Fei Chunhua's endurance was slightly insufficient, while Luo Shoufu's performance deteriorated rapidly, making him the worst performer of the day.</p>
<h3>The First Half Ended in a Draw</h3>
<p>The match began at 2:40 PM. Referee Deng Xiaoliang blew the whistle to start the game. Qingbaiqing's Li Yichen was mistaken for Mao. Qu Yongfu arrived on the field 26 minutes after the start. After joining the game, Qingbaiqing took the offensive first, but Railway's defense was tight and could not be penetrated. After seven minutes, Railway launched a fierce attack. Wu Binghao's corner kick was easily caught by Qin Bigao. Xiao Ziwen also took a corner kick, but it was offside. Before long, Lu Bingsheng fired a long shot from 25 yards, which Qin Bigao parried into a corner kick. Wu Binghao tried again, and Bigao saved it into a corner kick again. Railway could not break through, and Qingbaiqing, after a period of inactivity, attempted a surprise move. Jin Lusheng's shot went wide. At 26 minutes, Qu Yongfu arrived and replaced Xie Shizhan. He was indeed active, but Liao Xiong was especially on his toes, making one dangerous save after another. The first half ended with the two teams tied.</p>
<h3>A-Fu Scores in the Last Half Minute</h3>
<p>After the restart, Railway's lineup remained the same. Qu Yongfu moved to center forward, Gao Xiuqing played right forward, Gu Yiseh rested, and Wu Kaimai filled A-Fu's vacant spot. After joining the game, Qingbaiqing planned to flex their muscles. After two minutes, Gao Xiuqing penetrated alone, but unfortunately, he stumbled before the horse and failed to complete the attack. Before long, A-Fu received the ball and shot powerfully, but Liao Xiong slapped it into a corner kick. The area in front of the Railway goal was full of danger. Fortunately, Yue Renxiao and Wu Jiabang defended well, and no ambush was successful. After 25 minutes, Railway became active again. Lu Qingxiang made a small pass down the center, and Xiao Ziwen caught the pass and shot powerfully, but Bigao caught it with his ape-like arms. Qingbaiqing counterattacked. A-Lu and A-Fu advanced side by side, but both shots were saved by Liao Xiong. At 38 minutes, Yue Renxiao fouled outside the 15-yard line. Fei Chunhua squandered the opportunity. At 41 minutes, Renxiao, eager to save the ball, was injured in the chaos and had to retire, replaced by Fei Chunlin. Qingbaiqing took advantage of the opportunity and entered the field directly. Half a minute before the end of the game, Qu Yongfu scored a goal in the chaos. At the end of the statutory time, Qingbaiqing narrowly won by a score of 1-0.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Provincial Government to Develop Local Sugar Industry; Decides to Establish Large Sugar Factory in Cooperation with Industrial Corporation and the Resources Commission Taiwan Sugar Corporation</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] It is learned that Guangdong Provincial Government Chairman Song Ziwen, to develop the sugar industry in Guangdong Province, has decided that the Guangdong Industrial Corporation, invested by the Guangdong Provincial Government, will cooperate with the Resources Commission Taiwan Sugar Corporation to establish a large sugar factory in Guangdong, estimated to be worth about US$2 million. The factory's scale will be approximately 500 tons of sugarcane crushed every 24 hours, with a daily sugar production of about 50 tons. Currently, a sugar factory that meets this scale is being selected in Taiwan to relocate all the machinery to Guangdong for installation and crushing. It is reported that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation has sent engineers to Guangdong to investigate, and they believe the situation is quite suitable. Resources Commission Chairman Weng Wenhao and Taiwan Sugar Corporation Chairman Wu Zhaohong will personally go to Guangdong for on-site inspections around January 5th of next year.</p>
<h3>China Trust Bureau Extends Period for Purchasing Goods Arriving with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>After the solution of the percentage increase that should be added to the allocated price for goods arriving with self-provided foreign exchange, the China Trust Bureau's purchase procedures have been prepared and can begin immediately. It is recently learned that the validity period of the import permits issued by the Import Management Committee will end this month. The Bureau believes that the validity period is too pressing, and merchants cannot complete the procedures in time, so it has decided to extend the purchase period and has requested the Import Management Committee to extend the validity period of the permits. For these goods arriving with self-provided foreign exchange, the Bureau, considering the actual needs, will prioritize the purchase of paper and steel. The percentage increase agreed upon a few days ago is also for paper and steel. The second step is to purchase wood and metals. The percentage increase that should be added is being discussed with relevant parties based on the Bureau's investigation data. For goods applying for purchase, the original importer must go to the Bureau to handle the purchase procedures within two weeks from the date the Bureau notifies the original importer to go to the Bureau for purchase procedures. If the original importer who receives the Bureau's purchase certificate intends to apply for priority purchase of the originally allocated goods by direct users, they must apply for allocation within three weeks from the date of receiving the purchase certificate. Failure to do so will be considered a waiver of the priority purchase right.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders Yarn and Cloth Management Committee to Draft Various Detailed Rules</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] After the promulgation of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Regulations, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently ordered Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, to draft the following detailed rules immediately: (A) Detailed Rules for the Unified Purchase of Cotton, (B) Detailed Rules for Processing Spinning, (C) Detailed Rules for Processing Weaving, (D) Detailed Rules for Cotton Cloth Allocation. After the various measures are drafted, they will be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval so that the Committee can officially announce and implement them after its formal establishment.</p>
<h3>Strive for International Market and Promote Real Silk Export</h3>
<p>Although American silk prices have plummeted, our government is still trying to export and strive for the international market. According to news from relevant parties, our raw silk export still adopts three methods: Direct export of real silk to India, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Processing export, adopting the original method of the Silk Weaving Export Association, exporting real silk processed into silk fabrics. Exchanging foreign exchange earned from the export of real silk for rayon. Real silk export and processing export both have India as their largest market, but the profits from processing export are the highest. In the future, the focus will still be on processing and weaving silk fabrics. Currently, due to the plummeting American silk prices, the government is particularly active in this regard. Relevant parties are stepping up planning. It is also learned that the planned export of silk fabrics to India next year is 100,000 bolts. Since India has import restrictions, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made representations to the Indian government, hoping to allow the import of 100,000 bolts of our silk fabrics. Also, exchanging foreign exchange earned from silk export for rayon is still profitable.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Industry and Commerce Survey Can Be Published Next Spring</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The first step of the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' work plan for next year will be to complete the data compilation of the industry and commerce survey of the city and plans to publish it into a book next spring for reference by all sectors of society. The items of machinery equipment and production capacity of each factory in the survey data will be a powerful reference material for the determination of import raw material quotas. The Office hopes to expand the scope of the industry and commerce survey to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions next year. In addition, the allocation and factory construction of Japanese reparations materials for civilian use are all handled by the Office, which is a very arduous task. In addition, the industrial and mining equipment in the UNRRA's post-war relief materials will be managed by the Guidance Office after the Post-War Enterprise Committee determines the sales policy for the civilian factory portion in the future.</p>
<h3>Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, Hosts Banquet for All Committee Members</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] Yuan Liang, Chairman of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, hosted a banquet for all committee members, consultants, and heads of departments at the Li Zha Hotel on the evening of the 27th. During the banquet, Yuan delivered a short speech, stating that in this difficult time, the implementation of the cotton yarn and cloth management regulations hopes that everyone will cooperate greatly so that the government can suppress the prices of cotton yarn and cloth and see early success. The banquet ended at around 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Rise After More Buying</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cigarette market situation saw the market rally again because the cigarette tax increase is about to be realized, and there are rumors that factory prices will follow suit. Furthermore, with looser credit conditions, local demand is very strong, and external buying momentum is also strong. Throughout the day, the trend was that there were a lot of purchases of Senior Service cigarettes, and the price rose by 500,000 to 550,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Capstan cigarettes rose by 250,000 yuan, and the prices of other Chinese and foreign cigarettes and 50-cigarette packages also rose uniformly.</p>
<h3>New Soap Buying Activity</h3>
<p>The soap market, a daily necessity, was initially slow, but because dealers had ample funds, there were fewer sales, and the attitude of buyers in the market turned firm. As closing time approached, buying activity picked up, and the market rose. Finally, the price of Gu Ben soap rose to 1,083,000 yuan, an increase of 13,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Jian Dao soap rose by 5,000 yuan. In addition, Guanghua, Xiangmao, Meihua, and other soaps rose by about 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Mei Li brand matches rose sharply by 200,000 yuan, and Fenghuang and Nanjing Ningbo brands also rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Candles alone were stable.</p>
<h3>Domestic Triangular Belts Can Now Meet Demand</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] The Shanghai Rubber Tire Manufacturing Industry Association has repeatedly applied to the Import Management Committee's Quota Import Examination Office to import triangular belts to meet the needs of the rubber industry. It is recently learned that the Import Management Committee has twice requested the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Guidance Office to investigate the possible production volume of each factory and the general supply and demand situation to determine whether to approve the import. According to personnel from the Guidance Office, domestic manufacturers have already produced triangular belts. State-owned factories include the Resources Commission's Central Chemical Plant, and private factories include Zhengtai Xinji Rubber Factory, Dalai Industrial Company, Wuzhou Rubber Factory, Shenyi Rubber Belt Factory, and Qingdao Qilu Enterprise Company Rubber Factory. The quality of their products can already meet the needs of general industry.</p>
<h3>Business Briefs</h3>

<h3>Industrial Representatives to the Japanese Reparations Materials Evaluation Committee Have Been Appointed</h3>
<p>[Reported by our newspaper] In the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Evaluation Committee for Japanese Reparations Materials for Civilian Use, it is stipulated that the industrial sector will have two representatives. Wu Yun Chu recently told reporters that the Industrial Association has appointed Zhi Bingyuan and Yu Mingyu as attending committee members. Both have been engaged in the machinery and steel industries for many years and have extensive experience; and since 60% of the Japanese reparations materials are industrial equipment, the selection of these people is very appropriate. As of this time, official notification has not yet been received, but it will be submitted immediately after the Ministry of Economic Affairs' official document arrives.</p>
<p>Regarding the Ministry of Economic Affairs' recently promulgated payment method for private enterprises to purchase reparations materials, Wu believes that it is quite fair in principle. However, some factories suffered losses during the war, so they hope to receive greater preferential treatment.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding Japanese chemical industrial equipment, the Allied countries have previously agreed to dismantle a portion of it as a gift to China. According to Wu's information, the Allied Headquarters no longer intends to include factories for producing nitric   and fertilizer powder as reparations items.</p>
<h3>Overseas Remittances in November Only Half of October's; Detailed Figures Released by the Bank of China</h3>

<h3>What About Our Science Plan?</h3>
<p>— Liu Xian</p>
<p>Since this publication published Mr. Chenfeng's "Sketch of the British National Physics Laboratory" (Issue 18, December 1st) and Mr. Yang Shi's "American Ten-Year Science Research Plan" (Issue 19, December 8th), it has attracted considerable attention from all parties. We have received many letters from readers who have raised many concerns or questions about science in our country. In general, the main ideas can be divided into two categories: The first category says, "The organization of British scientific research institutions is so perfect, and the work is so intense. Doesn't our country also have the Academia Sinica? Doesn't it also have ten or so research institutes? Heaven, earth, people, culture, animals, plants, mathematics, and physics all have them. The history is also nearly twenty years old, and recently, there was also the election of academicians. It should be able to do some scientific research work for our country like British research institutes to solve our people's livelihood problems and national defense problems..." The main points of the second category are, "American science is so developed, and they still need a ten-year science research plan. Isn't our country calling for resistance against Japan and national reconstruction? It's been more than two years since victory. What about our science plan? We hope that we can also have a ten-year science research plan like the United States..."</p>
<p>All parties are so concerned and pay so much attention to the development of science in our country. This is indeed a progressive and gratifying phenomenon. However, judging from the content of many readers' letters, we feel that most readers do not have enough understanding of the situation of the scientific community in our country and are very estranged. For example, many readers do not know much about the content, organization, and past achievements of the Academia Sinica. They think that with such a lofty scientific research institution, any difficult scientific problems can be solved by them, which is an excessive expectation. Some readers say very bluntly that the victory of the Anti-Japanese War was a great opportunity, and building the country is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. To enrich the country and the people, there is no shortcut but to develop science. They earnestly hope that the government will no longer delay and should formulate a scientific construction plan as soon as possible and respond quickly to the situation. Some say that we can imitate the Soviet Union's five-year plan, and some say that we can follow the example of the United States and have a ten-year plan. These opinions can be said to be appeals. Regardless of when they are realized, they are very valuable.</p>
<p>Now, from the position of our scientists, in addition to fully accepting the valuable opinions provided by the readers of this publication (due to time constraints, we apologize for not being able to reply to each reader's letter individually), for the sake of the country's century-old plan, we must solemnly point out the importance and urgency of the post-war scientific construction plan of our country and hope to arouse the attention of the people of the whole country!</p>
<p>First, since two atomic bombs advanced the end of World War II, the power of science has been fully revealed. We firmly believe that the future development and evolution of the world situation and the progress or destruction of human civilization are actually held by science. To comply with the world trend, we should build scientific undertakings on a large scale to maintain international peace, otherwise, we will inevitably be slaughtered by others.</p>
<p>Second, our country is vast, rich in resources, and has a large population, which is uniquely blessed. However, now the country is poor, the people are suffering, the politics are chaotic, the economy is in danger, and the society is corrupt. The reasons for this are all because science is not flourishing and the people are ignorant. If we plan well to develop resources and focus on research, not only can we be sure to enrich the country and the people, but also politics can be brought back on track, and the declining social atmosphere can be changed.</p>
<p>Third, the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War greatly damaged the national strength, and the people suffered deeply. Fortunately, we gained more help than injustice, and justice triumphed over power, and we won the final victory. The international status has increased. We should cherish this hard-won achievement. Building science is an effective way to increase national power, the only guarantee for enriching national defense, and the only way to maintain international status.</p>
<p>Fourth, scientific research in our country showed considerable development before the Anti-Japanese War. The achievements gradually increased, and the number of talents increased. Given time, it would not be difficult to carry forward and make it great. Unfortunately, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and things went wrong again. The spring red was crushed, and the summer green was withered. This scientific seedling was almost completely destroyed. We believe that the government should face the needs of this time and place, equip scientific institutions as soon as possible, and provide generous funding. Those that have withered can be revived, and those that have not been established can be created immediately to meet urgent needs and protect the country's life.</p>
<p>Fifth, science in our country is backward, and industry is infantile. To build science, we must first have a detailed plan. Which are basic research, which are practical applications, which should come first, which should come later, how to determine the funding, and how to train talents must all be planned in advance, deployed properly, implemented year by year, and timed to achieve the expected results.</p>
<p>Sixth, at the beginning of constitutional government, everything is renewed. The scientific funding will be greatly increased, which may account for 15% of the total annual expenditure. Before the formal allocation, we should plan ahead, prepare a plan, and make good use of the allocation of funds for the scientific sector.</p>
<p>In short, for the sake of improving people's livelihood, enriching national defense, and contributing to academics, we urgently need to have a perfect science plan to serve as a standard. The scientific community in our country is not lacking in experts and talents with wisdom and foresight, and scientific construction is our duty, and we cannot shirk our responsibility. We hope that everyone will do their best, work together, and express their opinions together to select a scientific construction plan that suits the national conditions. Let us not let the Soviet Union and the United States be the only ones who are beautiful in the front. Fortunately, colleagues in the scientific community at home and abroad will rise up together to plan for it!</p>
<h3>How Pigeons Find Their Way</h3>
<p>— Zhi Mei</p>
<p>How do pigeons find their way? This question is what people generally want to ask and answer, but cannot. We often hear about long-distance pigeon races, where pigeons fly from one place to another, or we watch homing pigeon shows. But it's always strange how they can fly to their original home from unfamiliar places. Many scientists also consider this a mystery, unable to figure out the reason. It wasn't until September of this year that this difficult question was answered, discovered by H. L. Yeagley, an American physicist who has been engaged in research at the U.S. Army Pigeon Research Institute since the beginning of World War II.</p>
<p>When Yeagley began his research, he hypothesized that pigeons could sense the Earth's magnetism. He experimented using the following method: He used several pigeons and tied a small magnet to each of their wings, creating a small magnetic field to disrupt the Earth's magnetic lines. As a result, after these pigeons were released, they all got lost, while those pigeons without magnets all flew back. Yeagley thus proved that pigeons must be able to sense the Earth's magnetism.</p>
<p>However, relying solely on magnetic sensitivity is not enough for flight, because magnetic force gradually increases from the equator to the poles. Although a pigeon can distinguish the strength of the magnetism at its own home, it could potentially circle the Earth within an equal magnetic force line and still get lost. Therefore, we realized that there must be another force related to it.</p>
<p>Yeagley hypothesized that this force is called the Coriolis force, which is generated by the Earth's rotation and is related to latitude. The force is weaker at the equator and stronger at the poles. Yeagley also experimented with his ideal, using a map with latitude lines, on which he drew equal magnetic lines. Logically, since both latitude and equal magnetic force lines gradually increase from the equator to the poles, they should be parallel. However, because the geographic poles and magnetic poles are not in the same location, and the equal magnetic lines are slightly curved and not perfectly circular, the two lines often intersect at certain points. At these two points, the strength of magnetic force and Coriolis force is completely different. If a pigeon is released from a certain place, some might fly to one point, and others to the other. Fortunately, these two intersection points are usually outside the pigeon's flight range, so pigeons can usually fly back to their old home, that is, fly to the closer sensing point within their flight range.</p>
<p>Yeagley found on the map that the city of Kearney had the same magnetic force and Coriolis force as his hometown of Pensylvania (in the central United States). If his idea was correct, then putting the pigeons he trained in P city in another unfamiliar place near K city might be guided to K city by that same magnetic force and Coriolis force. So he built a new nest in K city, and released the tested pigeons a few miles away. As a result, those pigeons all arrived at their new nest. Thus, he proved that pigeons rely on a special sense of magnetism and sensitivity to find their way.</p>
<h3>Submersible Jeep</h3>
<p>— Zheng Zuoqing</p>
<p>The submersible jeep can go six feet deep into the water, with almost the entire vehicle submerged. If it weren't for the top of the engine needing to stay above the water, it would truly be a real submarine. The car was designed by the U.S. Navy to be amphibious for combat. Its appearance is exactly the same as an ordinary land jeep, but it is equipped with one hundred and twenty-five special components, including a waterproof ignition system, an extended exhaust pipe device, and a "breathing" pipe that extends above the water. The driver must wear a diving suit, except for the diving helmet. The four wheels of the vehicle are engraved with paddle-like patterns, so after jumping into the water, it can also turn freely, and the speed is not inferior to that on land. According to a Navy spokesperson, if the vehicle had been used earlier in the war, many lives would have been saved in beach invasion battles and forced crossing battles.</p>
<h3>"Poison Gas"</h3>
<p>— Zhao Zhen</p>
<p>When we talk about "poison," we have a sense of fear, feeling that "poison" is harmful to us. But we need to know, what exactly is "poison"?... Usually, when our bodies are attacked, the nervous system can easily make us feel pain and discomfort. However, after a short time, the cells and tissues in our body recover and no longer feel pain; but we are often unknowingly "poisoned." When the injury expands—when the tissues in our body are corroded by "poison" and undergo drastic changes—only then do we realize that we have encountered "poison." For example, on a cold winter night, in a room where the windows are closed so tightly that air cannot circulate, if a stove is lit, we often see in the newspaper the tragic news of the whole family dying. Indeed, "poison" is truly frightening. There are many poisonous substances. If they are in solid or liquid form, we can easily detect them. But when they are in a gaseous state, they mix into the air, following the flow of air and coming into contact with our bodies everywhere. At this time, we are unknowingly knocked down by "poison gas." Therefore, among poisonous substances, "poison gas" is the most terrible—"poison gas" can hide its face, thus making us unable to defend against it; and the space it invades is unlimited. It can move with the wind, sweeping across humanity everywhere.</p>
<p>In World War I, Germany manufactured many kinds of "poison gas" as a military weapon: Phosgene was the first "poison gas" used—an unstable gas formed by the combination of carbon monoxide and chlorine gas; and it is heavier than air. So when a cloud of "poison gas" blows over, it densely covers the ground, so even soldiers hiding in trenches or in poorly equipped bunkers cannot escape its invasion. When this cloud fills the area around you, it immediately causes your death—because at this time, the air around you has been displaced by it, and you can no longer get air supply; however, once you inhale this gas, it begins to decompose; as a result, not only does it bleach the lungs, but all the hemoglobin in the blood flowing in various parts of the body can be reduced and thus destroyed. Then, all the respiratory organs lose their function. Of course, at this time, you will definitely be suffocated to death. The victim's limbs are pale gray, indicating a state of extreme struggle; it is truly pitiful. So the name of this gas is very grimly called "Phosgene." Mustard gas is also a very terrible type of "poison gas." In the battle of the Somme, many people in Paris were injured and killed by it; they first developed blisters on their skin, which gradually swelled, and finally even the skin and flesh cracked, severely corroding the muscles of the body. For a time, there was no way to treat it, and within just 24 hours, the dead left only a complete skeleton.</p>
<p>We are all afraid of this kind of "poison gas"; but we need to know that there are many kinds of poison gas, and each has its special properties to stimulate various human organs. For example, Chlorpicrin and Benzyl-chlprioce, one called a diffusive "poison gas," and ciphenylchor-arsine gas, which stimulates the nasal passages, as well as laughing gas, can all be fatal. There are now hundreds of types of "poison gas" discovered, so the development of science brings a kind of cruelty to humanity; but we cannot therefore abandon science; we must remedy China's crisis and start with science. The promotion and development of China's science truly requires us to discover it!</p>

<h3>The Science of Perming Hair</h3>
<p>— Jia Ling</p>
<p>Perming hair is modern, and women are most concerned about these three thousand strands of worry. They can skip meals, but they can't skip doing their hair. Although European noblemen also wore curled hair in the Middle Ages, there are no records of curled hair in our country's history. So trying to find a sentence in ancient books to describe the beauty of curled hair is impossible. Perming hair is originally a Western civilization!</p>
<p>The hairdresser first carefully washes your hair clean, removing grease and oil, and cuts it to a suitable length. Then, they apply a "lotion" and curl it in electric clips to bake it into a curly shape. The main ingredient of the so-called "lotion" is sodium sulfite, with the addition of borax, ammonia, or carbonates.</p>
<p>Originally, the protein in our hair is Keratin, which contains 15% Cystine. Those who have studied chemistry know that a Cystine molecule is formed by two amino acids linked by two sulfur atoms. These constantly crisscrossing Cystine chains give hair its unique shape and properties. If the -S-S- chain of Cystine is broken, then the hair can be changed into any curl and shape, no longer adhering to its original form.</p>
<p>Therefore, we use weak alkaline substances such as borax and ammonia, and reducing sulfites to destroy the molecular structure, and with the help of heat and mechanical force, accelerate the chemical reaction to complete the mission of curling hair.</p>
<p>Why does hot curling not last?</p>
<p>Before electric perms were invented, everyone used curling irons for "hot curling," using heat to make the hair comply. Because there is only a physical effect and no chemical change, "hot curling" does not last. After two or three days, the hair completely returns to its original appearance.</p>
<p>American scientists are happy to serve women, and after nylon stockings, they invented "cold perms" to replace cream electric perms. This kind of cold perm does not require electricity or a perm machine. It can be done anywhere, anytime, simply, conveniently, and safely.</p>
<p>Cold Wave</p>
<p>You don't have to rush to the barber shop or beauty salon. You can just buy two kinds of hair curling lotions at home and start cold perming. After washing your hair, using the first lotion will make it automatically curl up, allowing you to create any style you want. Then, use the second lotion to fix it. Beautiful and novel curled hair is produced. Finally, you wash away the remaining lotion, and the "cold perm" is complete. This kind of hair curling lotion is already manufactured by several cosmetics companies in the United States, and it will soon be smuggled to Shanghai!</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, this trick is not mysterious at all. The first lotion contains Ammonium Thiglycollate, which can reduce -S-S- to two -SH Cysteines. And the second lotion is just acidified hydrogen peroxide, oxidizing Cysteine back into Cysteine, but the arrangement of the positions is changed, so a lasting and stable curl is produced.</p>
<p>Science Ramblings</p>
<h3>Nutrition (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Human life constantly needs food. On average, each person consumes about fifty tons of food in their lifetime, and roughly every seventy pounds of food are needed to grow one pound of body mass. This food can be said to be a raw material for building the body, and also a fuel for generating energy. The food we consume every day contains an average of 3000 potential calories, and the body then converts this potential energy into kinetic energy in a corresponding proportion (healthy people convert approximately 30-40% of potential energy into kinetic energy, which is similar to the mechanical efficiency of higher plants, and is four times the efficiency of ordinary automatic machinery) for use in work.</p>
<p>Looking at ordinary foods, when carbohydrates and proteins undergo oxidation in the body, each gram can generate four calories of heat, and fat can generate nine calories of heat. Water constitutes most of the weight of food and does not produce much energy, but it has a great effect on physiological functions.</p>
<p>In addition to this, humans often store the food they consume for future needs, so a strong and muscular person can maintain life without food for a period of one to two months. This is because their body tissue contains at least 7500 potential calories. This amount of energy is enough to sustain a person at rest for up to seventy-five days.</p>
<p>The raw materials of our food, as mentioned above, can usually be divided into four major categories: protein, fat, carbohydrates, and minerals. Foods like barley, wheat, rice, and white sugar are all so-called carbohydrates, and their main function is to generate energy. Fat probably interacts with carbohydrates in the body's metabolic processes. In healthy individuals, approximately 40-50% of the energy in the total food intake comes from carbohydrates, and 30-35% comes from fat. Moreover, fat often forms a protective layer around nerves, acting like a cushion to prevent sudden shocks to the nerves. We see that people who are hungry are often easily irritated, which is because there is a lack of fat around the nerves. The function of fat is not limited to this. If the diet lacks fat, our body cannot obtain those fat-soluble vitamins, and therefore there will be great physiological dangers. Although our body can usually produce fat from carbohydrates, many fats that cannot be produced have to be obtained from other animals, so we should not oppose eating more meat, but rather value it.</p>
<p>Protein is the essential element of protoplasm that forms the cellular part of life. Its molecules are very complex, but they are only composed of a few elements. Most proteins contain 51-55% carbon, 70% hydrogen, 20-23% oxygen, 1.55-2% sulfur, and some proteins contain trace amounts of phosphorus or iron. Ordinary plants can combine amino acids to form life-sustaining proteins, and animals then use these amino acids to make their own body proteins, but animals cannot create amino acids from simple elements like plants can. From this, it can be seen that animals cannot live without plants. It has now been determined that approximately twenty-one amino acids exist in natural proteins. If an animal is healthy, it must have at least some of these twenty-one amino acids in the food it eats. These twenty-one amino acids can chemically form at least 2,432,902,176,640,000 kinds of proteins or protein-like compounds, of which hundreds have been confirmed by research, and over a thousand are known to exist in nature.</p>
<p>Current research results prove that the condition for good health requires at least 50% minerals. This amount is the minimum requirement for a healthy person. According to this standard, each adult must obtain 0.86 grams of calcium per day. If the calcium intake exceeds this number, their health will be further improved. The reason for ingesting calcium is because our bones and teeth are constantly being corroded, and new molecules replace old molecules. Thus, the body continuously metabolizes and replaces calcium both internally and externally. Usually, all the calcium in our body is completely renewed every six years. If the calcium intake is insufficient at this time, the body must take calcium from the bones and teeth to make adjustments. If this happens, the body will suffer greatly!</p>
<p>The roles of phosphorus and calcium in the human body are like the relationship between electricity and light. Both are essential raw materials for forming teeth and bones. Within three years, our intake of phosphorus should be at least twice that of calcium. However, most of our food contains phosphorus, which is usually more abundant than calcium, so this is not a problem.</p>
<p>The iron content in the human body can only make a nail worth ten pennies. Although the content is not much, there is fundamentally no blood if there is no iron in the body. The blood of higher animals contains iron-bearing hemoglobin, and the so-called "anemia index" is determined by looking at the hemoglobin content. Every day, 8% of the blood cells in our body are destroyed. If there is no compensation from the iron in food, then the number of blood cells will become abnormal and cause anemia.

<h3>Talking About Old Age</h3>
<p>— Ji Yong</p>
<p>Foreign countries respect the elderly. Presidents are almost all over fifty years old, indicating that by this age, their experience and ability have reached the peak of perfection. When in power, they can handle things with ease. That is why there is the saying that forty is the beginning of life. We see the nearly ninety-year-old Bernard Shaw still constantly publishing his amazing masterpieces, and the over-seventy-year-old Winston Churchill is also full of vigor. Even as Atlee's Labour Party policies are on the verge of collapse, this old hero is still raring to go, preparing to win back the glory of the sun never setting on the British Empire for Great Britain. As for the white-bearded Stalin, he is even more astute, holding the fate of the world in his hands for the last hundred years.</p>
<p>However, this is not so common in the East. Someone in Japan said, "At forty, one should still be ashamed to be alive, for being of no benefit to others, nor of any benefit to oneself, it is truly better to die." This statement is certainly based on some truth, but the target of this satire must certainly be old people over forty. Although Confucius said that at thirty one establishes oneself, at forty one is no longer perplexed, and only at seventy does one follow one's heart's desires without transgressing the boundaries, in general, perhaps it is precisely at these ages that people are more perplexed and more likely to transgress the boundaries, and therefore cannot truly "establish" themselves. Even Confucius himself did not say, "When they are old, they must be cautious of greed," and "If one is not known at forty or fifty, then one is not worth fearing!" Not worth fearing is a small matter, seemingly passively unrelated to society. This greed, however, is truly China's fatal flaw. No matter how one cautions against it, it never works. On this point, we feel that the traditional Chinese advocacy of respecting the elderly needs to be discussed. The age requirements for civil servants should also be reconsidered.</p>
<p>Look, is "mature and prudent" ultimately good or bad? "Cunning and sly" is even more impolite, "decrepit and muddleheaded" is worse, and "abusing one's age" makes people avoid them for three days, while the phrase "senile" can almost encompass everything. Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons" bemoans the conflict between generations. Whether we are young or old, we generally sympathize with the next generation. But when we actually have children, we forget the sufferings of our youth, and can never reconcile with the second generation on matters such as marriage and ideology. Therefore, some people advocate that one must keep a diary, not for any other reason, but so that when your child asks to go to the park and you lose your temper and refuse, you can flip through the diary and see "I want to go to the park," which will then set you at ease. Then, the diary is also the basis for repaying debts, allowing us to eliminate the identity of the creditor and become the debtor.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that contradictions always exist within one person. The person who advocates concubinage today is the same zealous advocate of women's rights in the past, and the person who advocates filial piety as the greatest virtue and emphatically composes poems on the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars can also be the hero who single-handedly attacked the Confucian shop. What I say is that the elderly in the East are not good examples, mainly because of this. The biblical proverb that always advocates respecting the elderly probably exists because people generally do not sincerely respect them? I have always believed in Xunzi's words: "If one has it within, one will not seek it without." To demand respect for the elderly is due to disrespect for the elderly. Not only is there disrespect for the elderly, but it also seems that everyone believes that having reached a certain age, one can take a rest and not have to compete with the younger generation. Therefore, when Ma Yuan strikes his saddle and mounts his horse, his eyes shining with pride, is it not often met with ridicule from later generations, perhaps something like "shameless old man"? Since the Qin and Han dynasties, local autonomous personnel have been called the Three Elders of the Village, which is roughly equivalent to today's local tyrants and evil gentry. In my estimation, honest and useless farmers will inevitably suffer at their hands. These people are probably not less than forty years old. Some people say that "Three Elders and Five Watchmen" is actually "Three Elders and Five Old Men."</p>
<p>The path of life is full of hardships, and the origin of these hardships is mostly related to old age. When young, one is tripped by a stone, and later one turns into a stone to trip others. Why not throw the stone far away, or put it in the river or swamp to provide footing for others? As the year ends and age increases, one simply grows a year older. I am cautioning myself, and also cautioning others.</p>
<h3>Ghosts and Monsters</h3>
<p>— Yu Yuan</p>
<p>A few days ago, I read a very interesting story in an old English magazine. It said that in a certain city in the United States, there was a doctor who was quite famous. In the quiet of the night, he was dissecting a corpse alone. Just as he was getting into the dissection, suddenly, the corner of the corpse's mouth twitched and burst into laughter! The doctor then fainted. When people found him the next day, he had already left this world. This incident immediately aroused people's surprise and attention. Many doctors, in pursuit of the truth, then reopened the strange corpse for dissection. Finally, they unraveled the mystery. It turned out that people have a laughter nerve. In people who have just died, their laughter nerve still has some function. When the corpse was dissected, it was unintentionally touched, and the corpse emitted a terrifying laugh.</p>
<p>If this happened in our China, then the doctor's dissection room would definitely be crowded by crazy people. The "monster-making" corpse might be taken away or rented by someone with a business sense to open some kind of exhibition, selling tickets and running advertisements to make a fortune. The doctors probably wouldn't have the courage to come back and dissect it, and the newspapers would be filled with this news for half a month.</p>
<p>Isn't that right? We can often hear some news about "strange fires" and the like, and even implicitly suggest that there are "fox spirits" causing trouble. In fact, such phenomena can be explained scientifically as a chemical change of spontaneous combustion. Some things can slowly react with oxygen in the air at ordinary temperatures. If this thing is placed in a poorly ventilated place, then its temperature gradually increases, and it burns when it reaches the ignition point. For example, a carpenter carelessly leaves a cloth soaked in paint oil under the floor or on the ceiling. Over time, the phenomenon of spontaneous combustion occurs—of course, the "Great Immortal Fox" has shown its spirit again!</p>
<p>When people have suspicious events, they try their best to study them and pursue the truth, but we are not like that. Are magical ghost stories such as corpse driving and summoning still around? Some people deliberately exaggerate some small things to make them vivid in order to find excitement. Some people may know the "mystery" in it, but are unwilling to explain it clearly and spoil the fun. Still others cling to preconceived ideas and do not ask about the truth or falsehood; and others want to show off their erudition in front of others, so they boast and deceive people by wildly exaggerating. In this way, the truth disappears, and ghosts and monsters are everywhere.</p>
<h3>Lying</h3>
<p>— Ze Shi</p>
<p>This morning I told my young son to go and collect the household rice ration coupons, but he returned empty-handed near noon, saying they could only be collected in the afternoon. In the afternoon, I went to the oil shop myself, but they said they wouldn't be issued until next week. I asked where the afternoon claim came from, and they replied, "Probably your son was lying." I was furious, and gave the lying child a good beating. Still angry, I wandered around a nearby used bookstore to relax. After looking around for a while, I suddenly saw a small book called "Speaking of Lies in Wartime," written by a famous British lord.</p>
<p>Opening it up, the first thing I saw was a clever quote about lying cited by the author, such as "In wartime, the first casualty is truth." "You know that war is supported by a kind of argument that, after the war is over, people realize should never have been listened to." "It is easier to make money with lies than with honesty." The author also said in the preface, "Lying is a publicly recognized and very useful weapon of war." This book was first published in 1928, and the material in it was naturally collected from the last World War, which seems inevitably outdated, but it still came out in its eighth edition in January 1940, indicating that it may contain materials that later generations can learn from. Fortunately, the original price was only two shillings and sixpence, and now that it has fallen into the used bookstore to be sold, I don't think the price will be too high, so I asked the owner for the price.</p>
<p>"Forty thousand yuan."</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"Forty thousand is not expensive. Even if you buy old paper by the pound, it's worth that much. If you don't buy it today, the price will change tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Change to twenty thousand?"</p>
<p>"At least sixty thousand!"</p>
<p>I knew he was telling a complete lie, but the book clearly says "It is easier to make money with lies than with honesty." Since the used bookstore aims to make money, and easy money is the best strategy, how can I blame him for lying? And in all fairness, the price of books is actually the cheapest among all goods. Today, a better pack of cigarettes costs more than 30,000 yuan, and a better movie costs around 20,000 yuan. The result of a pack of cigarettes is twenty cigarette butts and a small jar of ashes. The remaining value of a movie is a description (which costs extra money). As for books, even if they cost 40,000 yuan each, after reading them, regardless of whether they contain a golden house or the beauty of jade, broadly speaking, they can be lent to friends and passed on to descendants, and narrowly speaking, they can be returned to the original store for multiple profits (if they can be hoarded for three and a half months). Since the Chinese people's skill in calculation is internationally renowned, and the Chinese people's respect and cherishing of written paper has a long history, then, at a time when the price of books is far below that of all other goods, the publishing industry should be unprecedentedly prosperous. Who knew that the reality is not the case? Nowadays, the Chinese people's attitude towards books seems to be somewhat like Confucius's attitude towards ghosts and gods—respectful but distant.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, I didn't buy the wartime lying collection either, because the bookstore owner kept shaking his head when I offered 30,000 yuan, and in a fit of anger, I left. On the way home, I bought two oranges for my son who I had beaten for lying. When comforting him, I told a lie, saying, "I met Uncle He on the road, and he gave you these two oranges." In fact, the truth I wanted to say was, "You promising child, you will definitely be very good at making money in the future, because you can lie. You have hope of entering the political arena in the future, because you can lie: there is a reward for liars!"</p>
<h3>Carefree Flower</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Such a Wonderful Night (28)</p>
<p>Zhu Erxi said happily: "So, you didn't want to leave Beiping, because I didn't come back, so you wrote the letter like that, right? I'm really sorry, I couldn't find time to come back because the task wasn't finished." Qi Wan said sternly: "No, I really want to leave, I have to leave." When Qi Wan said this, her face immediately darkened, and then she blurted out: "This time I was in the hospital recovering from my injury, and the outside world didn't pay much attention. After I came back, there were many rumors, especially that Lin, who came to me to pester me again and again, which added many idle talks to the outside world. My family is torn apart, and there is also a reaction. I am suffering from internal and external attacks, and I really want to leave this place to avoid it for a while. Last year, someone invited me to Dankou, but my father didn't agree, so it was cancelled. Now, someone has invited me, my brother, and the troupe to perform in Jinan. My brother and everyone else agree, but my father won't let me go. He won't say why, he just firmly says, 'If you go, I can't live!' I think it's a pity not to go, and the payment is quite satisfactory, so I repeatedly begged my father, but my father refused. I asked my father to explain why I couldn't go, and if we thought we really couldn't go, we wouldn't go. My father said, 'It's nothing, if you're not afraid of something happening, then go. Once you leave Beiping, it won't be easy to see me again.' My brother and I both felt that the old man was too worried, and declared that Jinan was not far from Beiping and nothing would happen. We had already arranged everything, so we shouldn't miss the opportunity. Just these few words made the old man slap the table. He shouted directly, 'None of you children listen to me, so why bother asking! Since everyone is like this, I don't care about anything, I'm old and annoying!' He yelled 'I don't want to live! I can't live!' He kicked over the box, took out his leather coat and leather hat, lit a fire and burned them. My brother apologized repeatedly to calm him down. He was angry all day that day, and fell ill with a fever that night. I am suffering from criticism from my colleagues outside, and such misunderstanding at home, and I am so anxious that I have nowhere to go. Later, Zhu Shichuan gave me an idea and asked my father's old friend Wang Shoushan to come forward and slowly persuade my father. He finally agreed to let my brother and I go back the day before yesterday, and my younger brother and his wife stayed in Beiping to take care of the old man. I was busy contacting all parties, and everything was finally prepared. I'm leaving early tomorrow morning. I wanted to see you before I left, so I wrote to tell you." As Zhi said this, she felt sad and uncomfortable, her eyes were full of tears, which were in her eyesockets, almost falling down, and she tried her best to hold back, looking at Zhi Zhai. At this time, Little Wang Ma pushed the door in, brought two bowls of lotus root noodles and two dishes of side dishes, and placed them on the table, to have a simple meal.</p>
<h3>Money Also</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>The Tang Dynasty's Prince Xiao Gong of Hejian was young, calm, and perceptive, and grew up to conquer all sides, achieving success wherever he went. He once said to someone: "My residence is quite magnificent, but it is not what I want. I always build another area that is just enough to serve the purpose. After I die, if my son is talented, he can easily keep it; if he is not talented, it will not be used by others," and so on. This is the same as the words of Shu Guang in the Han Dynasty, "If a wise man has too much wealth, he will damage his ambition; if a foolish man has too much wealth, he will increase his mistakes. Moreover, the rich are resented by the public. Since I have no way to teach my descendants, I also do not want to increase their mistakes and cause resentment." Their vision and understanding were truly outstanding and the same throughout. The Southern History says: "After Wang Zhen'e pacified Guanzhong, his prestige shook the master, and he collected a lot of women, jade, and silk. The emperor thought he had great merit and let him be. At that time, someone said that Zhen'e had different ambitions, and the emperor secretly sent someone to observe him, and saw that he was only recording the gold and silver in the army treasury, and discarding the jade on the side of the wall. The emperor said, 'Zhen'e loves gold and silver, so it can be known that he has no long-term ambitions.' His heart was at peace." This is clear evidence that money can damage ambition. Originally, money is a circulating currency in society. It is enough to have enough to eat and use. What is the benefit of having more! Like Zhou Kui, the Earl of Jiading, and the eunuch Wang Zhixin in the late Ming Dynasty, when Li Zicheng's army approached the capital, Emperor Chongzhen asked them for help. Zhou Kui said he didn't have any, and Wang Zhixin was the richest, but he only donated 10,000 taels of gold, and the rest was not a penny. Later, when the capital was captured, these people were arrested, tortured, and forced to donate gold. They were never satisfied, and they were still tortured. As a result, Wang Zhixin was tortured and forced to donate 150,000 taels of gold, and Zhou Kui was confiscated 520,000 taels of silver, Chen Yan 30,000 taels of silver, 3,000 taels of gold, and three dou of pearls, and the others more or less. At that time, unable to bear the torture, Wei Yu, Fang Yuegong, Qiu Yu, and others all committed suicide. I think if these wealth had been donated to the army at that time, things would have been successful in every way, but Zhou and others were inherently stingy and unwilling to give it up. They only "obediently" showed it after the bandits came to use torture. Wei and others did not commit suicide until they could not bear the torture. It is truly what is called "only knowing that wealth is a disaster when dying." According to the Southern History's Book of Qi, Emperor Donghun was immoral. When Xiao Yan's army entered, he was repeatedly defeated, but he still asked for rewards from above. Ru Fazhen kowtowed to argue, and he replied, "Did the thief come only to take me? Why do you call me to ask for things!" When historians write about this, it is truly laughable! Yuan Jianzhai wrote in a poem: "Everything is lovely, but money is the best interest; you can't invite it when you're alive, you can't take it with you when you die." I would like to tell the wealthy gentlemen that you should think things through and not get stuck in the eyes of copper coins.</p>
<p>Illustrated Chongqing Storytelling</p>
<h3>An Example of Fighting</h3>
<p>— Bai Wuwen Long Sheng Jin</p>
<p>For example, if someone asks me what is the most serious social problem in Chongqing society, besides eating, I will open any day's local edition of the newspaper and point it out to him: news about "fighting" accounts for more than 10%.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of fighting did not start today, but today it has developed to a fever pitch; if we say that the people are valiant, Sichuan is not counted, initially, only in Jiaochangkou there were people "fighting with hammers" (Chongqing dialect: mutual or group fighting) every day, because that is the concentration of "airplanes" (Chongqing dialect: hooligans); hooligans are professional hammer fighters, not fighting is an accident, but today, there are clearly many amateur fighters.</p>
<p>The ones who often fight with hammers are the coolie porters, fighting to compete for work opportunities, it is not surprising to fight, the competition is so sharp.</p>
<p>The ones who fight every day are the theaters, there is little porridge and many monks, if they are not allowed to come in to see the show for free, they resort to fighting, and the employees who "hold the fence" in front of the theater are those who can withstand fists.</p>
<p>What is strange is that the fighting trend has actually entered schools: students in the physical education department of Chongqing University injured as many as seventeen classmates because one classmate jokingly called them a circus troupe.</p>
<p>A judge of a Chongqing local court beat the clerk in the office, which is clearly a psychological influence of hearing too many cases of interrogation and abuse, people who hear too many plays often become good actors, and unknowingly start singing.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for children to fight in the streets and alleys, and for deaths to occur.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw two people wrestling in Liziba, moving in a cowboy posture, one hitting the other's lower body, and the other falling down to trip the other with their feet, the technique was quite skilled, although the skin was broken and bleeding profusely, it was not practice or just playing around. The most wonderful thing is that one was wearing a big plate hat, and the other was wearing a leather jacket, as if deliberately pretending to be a cowboy from the American West.</p>
<p>This is naturally due to the release of widespread depression, but it is also somewhat due to the awareness of superiority, bullying the weak, and bullying the few, although hammer fighters do not have to be Nietzsche's philosophical believers, but the mood to eat you is there, so everything is resorted to force. I heard that national mental health experts have held meetings to discuss, I wonder if there has been a review and conclusion on this "holy land fighting trend"? If not, I would like to contribute a word——卍".</p>
<h3>The Death of Old Pu</h3>
<p>— Ling Xiaohan Pavilion</p>
<p>In the past, I heard that Cai Yuanpei said before his death that he was willing to have his body dissected for medical research after his death to discover pathology and benefit future generations. The enthusiasm and insight of the great philosopher are naturally different from vulgarity.</p>
<p>Zhang Pu was upright and bright throughout his life, with a great personality. The circumstances of his death have something worth studying in terms of hygiene. He fell ill very suddenly and passed away too quickly, so he had no last words, and he may not have considered this, but Lao Pu had a spirit. He will certainly agree with the following description as not being wrong, and approve of it.</p>
<p>According to the Tianjin Republic Daily Telegraph, Lao Pu had been working diligently for days to review the list of Legislative Yuan candidates, without any rest. Therefore, he woke up particularly late on the 15th, had breakfast at the party headquarters, went to the Party History Compilation Committee at noon, and then went to the party headquarters in the afternoon for a meeting, and then went to the President's office to discuss matters. After returning home, he reviewed documents and had dinner, eating one more bowl of rice than usual. Not long after dinner, he shouted with abdominal pain. One doctor did not come because it was late at night, and another doctor came, but the person was already dying. The initial diagnosis was appendicitis, but later it was said that "he ate something bad"!</p>
<p>Eating is to maintain health, but it backfired and even became fatal. I will now cite an incident in Beiping as proof.</p>
<p>Two rickshaw pullers, after pulling passengers for a day, earned a lot of money. They were very happy to have dinner at a cake stall. One of them ate a lot. The other made an agreement with him, saying, "If you have the ability to eat five pounds of big cakes at once, today is my treat!" He happily agreed, and ate greedily, finishing everything in an instant. The other paid as agreed and said goodbye. At first, the one who ate felt bloated, then he felt a tightness in his internal organs, and finally he suffered painfully, suffocated, and died. Some say that it was because he could not be treated at night, or that the poor had no money to hire a doctor. But suppose the doctor arrived, what would he do? Because this is an unusual disease, and it is not an acute disease. There is no disease name and no diagnosis case. Surgery cannot be performed for a tumor: this is not a tumor. Arsenic cannot be used happily: this is not arsenic.</p>
<p>It is human nature for Lao Pu to be busy all day and return home for a full meal. His family did their best to call for a doctor and seek help, and the doctor's inability to treat him was also a fact. Explaining that "he ate something bad" is a master of this field, and does not fall into the usual clichés of flattery and perfunctory treatment. In short, there is nothing to complain about this matter. If viewed as a disease, it was completely unexpected. Even if one is careful about diet, who has the time to plan everything perfectly when "those who are busy are easily fed"?</p>
<p>However, combining the above two matters for reference, so that future generations will remember this: "Busy people are easily hungry, and should not eat quickly, and even more should not overeat." This will create immeasurable benefits, and is even more effective than donating the body for anatomical research. Daily life is extremely easy to overlook.</p>
<h3>The Greatness of the World</h3>
<p>— Xin Meng</p>
<p>In the American island state of De Teiborg, a woman, when she was 100 years old, lively jumped ten times in a row the Polish "er-de-zi" dance.</p>
<p>In Washington, there is a wealthy old man who, at the age of 102, got a job in a machine shop.</p>
<p>In Teibosuo, England, an old man, at the age of 104, worked as a traveling salesman for a model rack shop, traveling to and from various places.</p>

<h3>"Poor Women's Delivery Assistance" Group Expanded Hui Production Gynecology Hospital Joins the Cooperation All Poor Pregnant Women Can Apply Starting in January Next Year</h3>
<p>I remember there is an ancient saying that "the shape of newly created things must be simple," then the "Poor Women's Delivery Assistance Movement" also conforms to the meaning of this sentence. In February this year, under the urgent need of objective conditions, this movement was hastily included in the "Social Services" item of this newspaper. At that time, due to the limitations of manpower and material resources, this movement could only be promoted at a slow speed. We used limited strength to serve poor women. For the past ten months, colleagues have been working hard and constantly learning, and at the same time constantly encouraging themselves. We have adhered to the ancient motto of "where there's a will, there's a way," and worked hard to protect the young sprout that was born not long ago, so that it slowly grows stronger! At the beginning, only Renhe Hospital cooperated with us, and only two or three pregnant women were helped each month, but today, the number of cooperating hospitals has increased to four, and more than 50 pregnant women benefit each month. Starting from January 1 next year, Hui Production Gynecology Hospital at No. 167 Huangjiasha, Dananmen, Nanshi will also join the group to serve poor pregnant women. The application procedures are still the same as the simple rules that have been cooperated with the four hospitals in the past. We hope that in the near future, the "Poor Women's Delivery Assistance" cooperative hospitals can announce that they will cover every part of the city, so that every poor woman who is unable to give birth can receive scientific delivery and new-style medical care, which is a most beneficial act for the people.</p>

<h3>Postal Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>We have received letters of inquiry from Mr. Shi Ren'en of this city, Mr. Dang Ran Zongwen, and Mr. Chen Mengfang of Beijing Road in this city. We will answer the points raised as follows.</p>
<p>(Answer) (A) The opening procedures and deposit amount for check savings are stated in the "Summary of Check Savings Simple Rules." Please read them at the nearest post office. (B) Each postal identity certificate costs 17,000 yuan. Chinese citizens who are 20 years old or older can submit two recent photos of themselves to each postal administration for issuance. After the post office agrees, the applicant should sign and stamp the postal identity registration book and find two guarantors to be responsible for the guarantee. (C) Mail sent from Shanghai to Tibet is sent through Calcutta, India, and the postage should be calculated according to foreign postage rates. (D) There are currently four types of postal publications: Postal Regulations, the 15th edition compiled by the Postal Bureau, the International Postal Convention, and the Postal Law. All local post offices sell them. The ones that are being printed are the English translation of the Postal Regulations and the combined edition of the Postal Affairs Annual Report of the Republic of China for the years 30 and 31. (A) For airmail to Jilin, this bureau seals it every night and sends it to Beiping for forwarding. The entire journey takes about four or five days. (B) Air express and air regular mail are sealed and sent at the same time. Express mail is delivered as soon as it arrives, and regular mail is delivered at the scheduled time. (C) If various letters cannot be delivered, they will be returned to the sender according to the name and address of the sender indicated on the envelope. (A) Two and a half newspapers weigh about 60 centimeters. Airmail should have postage of about 5,000 yuan. The thickness of the newspaper varies. Please take it to a nearby post office to check the weight and calculate the cost. (B) Intended to be contacted.</p>
<p>Lost and Found On December 26th at 5:15 PM, a paper package was lost on bus No. 4 (car No. 355) from Lanzhou Road to Dashalu Road. It is useless to the finder, but I am quite troubled. Please send a letter to Feng Ganqing, No. 7, Lane 188, Taiyuan Road, and I will come to collect it. I am very grateful.</p>
<p>The compatriots in distress are suffering from hunger and cold, how miserable! Please do your best to help, the merit is immeasurable. This newspaper solicits winter clothing or cash on behalf of them. All are welcome.</p>
