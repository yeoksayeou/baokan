<h3>政府現正覓取「鑰匙」　重行打開和談之門　國府政院決定先行改組</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳鐵城氏於四日接見記者時談稱：改組府院，政府具有決心，惟國大方告閉幕，又値新年假期，時間匆遽，故目前與參加國大各黨派關於改組政府之洽商，尚在初步試探階段。政府與南京中共代表團尚無正式接觸，惟中共與民盟如能參加政府，自爲政府竭誠歡迎。政府始終希望重開和談，以期達到和平統一，並盼未參加國大之黨派，亦能參加政府。</p>
<p>政府依據已定步驟，決先改組國府委員會及及政院。至立法院是否擴大，則尚在政府考慮中。至報載在野黨派主張有擴大立法院，以制定有關憲法之各項法規一事，吳氏稱：立法院爲政府之一部，故參加立法院亦即參加政府。至國府委員會改組之後，有人以爲如中共民盟未能參加而府委名額仍虛席以待者，則參加改組政府之其他黨派名額甚少，勢不能與國民黨籍府委之絕大多數抗衡一事，吳氏稱；此次靑年·民社二黨參加國大，政府亦未以絕大多數決定一切，秉以往合作之經驗，深信國府委員會中亦不能合作無問。將來國府委員會成立後，最高國防會議即撤銷，政院如何改組，即當在國府會議中決定。地方政府暫無變動，因祇須中央認爲必要，地方政府隨時皆可改組也。</p>
<p>吳氏稱：政府工作不可一日停頓，和談與改組政府，當同時進行，現正覓取「鑰匙」，以重副此和談之門。</p>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕靑年黨主席曾琦，常委陳啓天，余家菊，常乃惪，已由京分別抵滬，據悉；該黨中常會例會，將於日內在滬舉行，對參加政府改組問題，將提出商討。記者昨向陳啓天氏即詢最近會否與吳秘書長晤談？渠稱：本黨同人在京曾與吳氏接觸，返滬後，尚未見面，日內必將有機會再度晤談。又據周謙冲氏稱：最近本黨同人曾與民社黨張君　，張東蓀兩氏晤面交接意見，談及司徒大使深望中國能迅速恢復和平環境，俾利行憲。因此本黨現正努力促進國共雙方恢復和談。周氏並稱；吾人希望和談如能恢復，須能實現眞正永久和平，不要再造成過去拖的局面，俾與大局實際有所補益。</p>
<p>〔本報南京四日電〕新主席張治中，業已成爲目前首都之政治活動中心人物，張竟日與各方接見，外傳現正就恢復和談之方式硏究中。張於四日下午七時偕國府參軍皮宗敢往訪馬特使，有所晤談。又張三日曾訪馬使，外傳張來京將與和談有關，不爲無因。</p>

<h3>張治中發表談話　來京純係述職無他任務　最近擬返安徽巢縣掃墓</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕新疆省主席張治中將軍，前日抵京，記者四日特往晤談，張氏首說明此次返京，純爲述職，繼稱：赴新就任主席雖祇九月，然離京則已逾十年，對最近政局演變，難圯有隔閡之感。張氏復以幽默口吻語記者稱，報載本人擬再作馮婦，斡旋和平，此乃新聞界所賦余之新任務。張民又謂新省今後施政方針，將完全依照擬就之施政綱領進行，同時注重三民主義之民族主義精神，維護少數民族敎育經濟及政治之利益，而當前要務，爲協助地方人民生活之改進及平抑物價。張主席來京後，運日酬酢甚忙，三日曾謁見主席，今會應馬歇爾特使邀宴進午餐。張氏並表示，渠本人最近擬返故鄉安徽巢縣掃墓。</p>
<h3>美科學箴言報　詳析國共關係</h3>
<p>〔中央社組約三日電〕基督敎科學箴言報，頃以其第一版半面篇幅，登載南京頒布新憲法新聞，該報在其駐滬記者論新憲法文章之四週，並刊登蔣主席，司徒雷登，馬歇爾，宋子文，毛澤東等之照片，並以新憲法爲題，詳細分析國民黨與共產黨之關係。據稱：中共雖揚言抵制新憲法，然參加政府之門尚未關閉，蓋恢復談判以結束內爭之謹愼之希望，仍然存在。該報另有一文，係論及中國經過長期痛苦，步向立憲政府。</p>
<h3>于院長廣播</h3>
<p>勉國民克盡責任</p>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕于院長三日應中央廣播電台之邀，講述「憲法公布後之新中國」，于氏認爲：憲法之制定，爲國家建設成功之基石，于氏指出今後憲法施行，國民黨正式選政於民，以酬向來之志願，將來國家興衰成敗，全在國民善盡其主人翁之責任。自憲法公布之日起，至憲法施行之日止，此一段期間，國民政府固然要依照憲法實施之準備程序，但如何愼選賢能，以代表國民監督政府，則全在全體國民身上。吾人要成功眞正之民主國家，就須每一國民皆能克盡其責任，尤其克盡其擁護憲法，實行憲法之責任。</p>

<h3>傳斯年談話</h3>
<p>〔聯合社南京四日電〕中央研究院歷史系主任傅斯年，今日向聯合社記者談及各校學生游行示威事，認爲各校學生誤將與政治無關之事件，作爲政洽事件。此案固屬遺憾之至，但純爲法律問題。記者間其對於學生要求美軍退出中國之見解，傅氏答稱：准許美軍留華完全爲中國政府之政策間題，學生倘不滿此項政策，儘可向政府請願。十六個月以前，美軍曾與中國軍隊並肩對共同之敵人作戰，近十個月來，美軍且協助中國政府遺送日俘回國，此種任務尚未終了，中國境內尚有大批日兵，迄未解除武裝。中國智識階級對於國際政治應具遠大眼光，並須認識中國不能在國際間孤立。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京四日電〕南京各大學學生數千人於三日舉行示威遊行，要求美軍退出中國。事後各主持者曾招待各報記者，當各記者紛紛提出各項質詢時，三學生代表發言者均訥訥不能對。某記者堅請說明彼等示威遊行之眞義何在，各學生代表乃交頭接耳，竊竊私語，歷時頗久，最後其中一人囁嚅曰：「你們記者不能拿這個複雜的問題來盤問我們，我們只是學生子，所知道的是有限的。」記者旋又提出質詢謂：彼等要求美軍退出中國，馬歇爾特使是否亦在此例？彼等提出之要求，對於現仍駐在東北各地之蘇軍何以隻字不提？學生代表　躇答稱：「我們還沒有考慮到那個問題，這問題須待全體學生來決定？」此後各記者又提出若干問題，均不得要領，乃廢然而退。</p>

<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中宣部彭部長學沛，爲慶祝新年及中華民國憲法頒布，特於昨日下午四時，假華懋飯店八樓舉行鷄尾酒會，招待本市中外名流·民社·靑年各黨主要人物及中外新聞界人士，到社會各流徐寄廣·王曉籟·靑年黨常乃憲·陳啓天·周誰冲·崔萬秋·英海軍聯絡主任佐斯上校。新聞處主任奧德中尉·美新聞處處長哥威爾。法新聞處處長甘默及本市中外報館·通訊社·雜誌負責人共百餘人，彭部畏在會中爲新聞記者採訪之目標，彭氏周旋其間，曾回答若干記者之問題，盛會至五時半方散。　彭部長於昨日招待會中發表書面談話，原文如次：「一個有人口四萬萬，包含漢·滿·蒙·回·藏許多宗族的國家，在四十天的時間裏，一致同意訂定了一部憲法，這不能不說是一件驚人的事實，甚至無所不反對的中共，對於這憲法的基本原則，也曾在政協時簽字贊成，這個憲法如此順利通過，看來容易，實際是國父孫先生和蔣主席先後領導六十年革命和抗戰的結果，現在我們得到了道部憲法，只有大家共同遵守，一切爭端依憲法來解決，道才是達到和平統一達到民主唯一的途徑。</p>
<p>中國的經濟生活，在勝利一年半之後，還未見顯著的改善，原因是很簡單的，八年抗戰中和戰後各地的破壞，情形慘重，不是普通人所龍想像，試舉幾個例來說明。</p>
<p>交通方面，戰前關內有公路十一萬二千公里，抗戰期中在後方新修一萬四千公里，現在這些公路中，至少有五萬公里要整修，戰前修疑公路，每公里約需費一萬元，現在每公里需一億元，價格漲了一萬倍，修理費亦每公里平均至少需二千萬元，路纔可用，即是說僅僅修復舊有公路，便需要一萬億。</p>
<p>鐵路在戰時遭受破壞，還沒有修復的的二千七百公里，都在長江以南，戰後被中共破壞還沒修復的的一千九百公里，都在隴海路以北，綜共舊路待修約有四千六百公里，戰前鐵路每公里建築平均的費十萬元，現在平均每公里的十億元，各路破壞程度甚烈，修理幾等於重修，僅僅修復舊鐵路，便約需四萬八千億元。</p>
<p>抗戰留剩下來唯一的重要工業是紡織業，在戰前兩年國內棉花的出產，已達自給的程度，現在機錠减少，而棉花四分之三靠外國輸入，消耗巨量的外匯。</p>
<p>戰前關內每年的煤產量的二千萬噸。現在低落到八百萬噸，關內各煤礦動力和運輸設備的損失，約達百分之八十，最近一個規模極好的大同煤礦又遭全部破壞。</p>
<p>誠然，我們從敵偽接收了一些工廠，這些機器在戰時封鎖狀態下頗有用處，現在全國開放了，給國外新式機器的競爭，那些機器大部份恐怕只能看做廢鐵。</p>
<p>房　恐慌的嚴重性，亦不滅其他各項，姑舉江西爲例，省會南昌房屋毀壞了四分之三，全省八十三縣之中，民居損失了五分之一的，有三十餘縣之多，因此流離失所的難民無法重返故里，全部恢復恐需一個世紀，一省如此，其他可知。</p>
<p>戰前中國中部三條大河流入海洋，黃河，淮河，揚子江，抗戰中種種破壞的結果，黃河，淮河，都挾巨量的泥沙流入揚子，引起逐漸淤淺的危險，現在先要把兩條河各別搬回故道，所需經費，難以估計。</p>
<p>經過了這些破壞損失之後，要恢復起來，一需現金，二需材料，三需人工，四需時間，這四件都不是咄嗟可辦的，在現在狀况之下，全國各地盧舍爲墟，廠礦破壞，交通梗阻，燃料缺少，原料缺乏，國民經濟問題是一個物質的問題，是一個艱鉅的問題，決不是僅僅調整匯率或關稅或稅制或其他一紙理論政策便能解決，唯一出路，只有在極度節約之下，流血流汗，努力建設。</p>
<p>今年的特徵，在政治上將是憲政的開始，在經濟上將是刻苦的生活，勒勞的工作。」</p>
<p>中宣部長彭學沛在滬招告訴各界，中舉不者為彭氏（中國社）</p>

<h3>花園口堵復工程　因中共阻掛撓至遷延迄今　如無意外凌汎前可合龍</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京四日電〕黃河自廿七年在鄭縣花園口潰決後，潰水即奪流南趨，長入運河，汜濫區域達二萬九千平方公里，受災人民，達六百餘萬之衆，演成空前浩刧。勝利前後，豫·皖·蘇各地方政府以及各省縣民意機關，均紛紛藉請早日完成堵口工作。中央為軫念人民疾苦，幷謀恢復廣大氾區之生產，爰經決徒堵日復堤之進行方針，去年三月一日正式動工，唯以黃河堤統長達一千四百餘公里，其中三分之二地段，在中共控制之下，不僅無法施工，即初步之查勘測量，亦不能進行。政府為拯救汜區六百餘萬災民，迭與中共商討堵口復堤進行方法，自五月十八日在京與中共代表議定實施原則後，水利委會即一本該項協議進行，其問中共一再阻撓，破壞協議，新鄉璐王墳石廠之遭受破壞，山東修防處測量隊員工在濟陽之被俘，以及最近河北長垣工地員工被擄，與璐王墳石廠之又遭破壞，均為明證，但水利委員會仍始終邀照協議原則，妥愼進行，現在堵口樁工完成，正趕辦提護工竹，進行尙稱順利，如再不生意外阻撓，凌汛以前當可合龍。</p>
<p>下游復堤工程，依照協議原則，在中共區者，應由中共負責辦理，此項工程費用，巳由水利委會核據美籍顧問塔德之建議，於六七月間先後呈准撥交八十億元，請行總按照工作成績計値付款。據該願問之視察報吿，認為巳付之款及行總總已發之糧，可抵補未完工程之費用，至於國軍境內之復堤，現已完成之土方，共計三百餘萬公方，亦將達完成階段，此外，關於國共銜接地帶之復堤工程，以工作人員無法前往，曾由黃河堵口復堤工程局，派員隨同塔德顧間及中共代表赴工視察，以備加緊趕進。頃據十二月廿五日報告，讠員等穿入中人區域以後，三日內遭愛共軍攔　五次之多，共發槍百餘響，無法執行視察任務，到達魯境章秋集，即停止前進，似此有計劃之阻撓，對於整個黃河堵口復堤，實予嚴重之影響。</p>
<p>關於中共所轄共同河故道河床之居民遷移救濟費，以故道原屬河床，人民本不應居住，政府為顧及民生，並謀工程之能以順利推進起見，爰經核撥專款，交由行總按照商擬辦法主持辦理，以期實惠及民，現正積極進行中。</p>
<h3>克利浦斯爵士函謝主席夫婦</h3>

<h3>日本廉價紡織品　將奪取世界市塲　紐約商業週刋提出警告</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約四日電〕據商業週刊雜誌稱：日本在美國軍事當局協助下其廉價紡織品，迅將在世界各市塲取得統治地位，而中國經濟情况之不良，使其國內工廠欲取得曾為日本所控制之紡織貿易，亦無法達到其希望。商業週刊並稱：美國駐日軍事當局，力主迅速增加日本紡織品之生產，以支付盟軍佔領費用。同時刻正訪仍東方各國之英商務團之紡織界團員，已提出警告謂：英國將阻五任何允計日本恢復其在東南亞紡織品市塲之計計劃。該週刊並預法屬越南之情況，長此不穏定，將使東方各國所亟需之越南所產米煤，不能大量出產。</p>
<h3>塞外新長城（上）　傳作議將軍會見記</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　俞振基</p>
<p>照民意做人的志</p>
<p>在張塲稀有的一個　會上，一位外國記者於濟　耳熱後，向傳作義將軍舉杯敎敬，並致祝詞稱：「馬歇爾元師曾稱贊您，說你每一寸都帶善將軍氣，今日得瞻手儀，眞是無任榮幸。」這幾句辭得體，善頌善禱的話，想來該得到傳長官的頷首贊許。不謂傳將軍開言議所表露出的，只是一種不豫之巳，並且　述說：「我自己一點都看不出，我只覺　我是一個鄕下土老兒，一個來自民間的　下佬。我傳作義要是稍有成就的話，完全因為我所做的一切，都是依昭善人民的意志做去的，凡是人民願意做的事，我就去幹，我絕不做半點遠反民意的事。臂如說：抗戰，在當時是每一個人民所願意的，我依照人民的意思抗戰，把日本人打挎于，旁的打日本的將領亦將日寇打敗了。現在我所做的一切，亦完全照人民意志做去。」這幾句乏自心坎的話，於記者留張的短期問內，獲得了充分的證明。</p>
<p>需要安定有飯吃</p>
<p>當前人民最所需要的是安定與有飯吃，傳作義將軍目前在察哈爾省所身體力行的，即是為遠到上述兩個目的。他說：「今後察省施政方針，主要的是為了安定治安與改善人民生活。察哈爾省並不窮，學其說說它窮，無寗說它富，要好好建設起來，是有無限前途的。」</p>
<p>使他最難過的是察省破壞得太厲害了。因為談到道點，就扯到整個國是前途，他非常關心國事，曾一再問起記者們對這次國大的感想，他以為這次國大所擬定的憲法，是國人幾十年來鬥爭與抗日用了利的成果，新經　的民主成份非當多，共黨即使不子承　。亦沒有多大影響的，因為憲法要能得到每個人的通過是不可能的，現在的憲法旣巳是根據最大多數人民意怎擬定的，當不致因少數人的反對而受任何影響</p>
<p>希望中共能合作</p>
<p>對憲法雖抱這種看法，但傳將軍是始終希望中共能與政府携手的。中外記者團在張先後會四次晉謁，在每次談話中，他都强調這一點。在記者團到崇禮參觀血淋淋的事實回到張垣的晚上，他以極度沉痛的語調，發表對慘案的感想後，仍說：「政府是希望和平的，我為人民着想，亦極盼和平，只要談判能得好，什麽問題都不難迎刃而解。」</p>
<p>有一個記者問他，南京報上猜測中共可能再來一次長征，將根據地由延安遷往東北佳木斯，山西或寗夏，照傳將軍的看法，中共最後將遷往何處？傳將軍的答覆是：「我希望他們不要跑，而來跟我們合作，為國家前途計，「我們希望能走上民主統一之路。」這幾句直率而誠懇的話，當時曾使在塲的記者全部感動，相信對方聽到這幾句話後亦不致無動於衷的。（未完）</p>
<p>社論</p>
<h3>緬甸獨立的新曙光</h3>
<p>一九四七年元旦從倫敦傳來的一個比較可喜的消息，是緬甸政府政務委員會的副主席烏安商已被派前往倫敦，出席首相艾德禮所召開約有關緬甸之將來的會談。又據自仰光來的消息，則謂緬甸臨時政府已決定派遣代表團前往倫敦，出席有關緬甸前途及將來的英緬關係之會談，而以政務委員會副主席烏安商為代表團團長，將於一月一日離緬飛英。在臨行的前夕，烏氏在仰光民衆大會席上，對參加之四萬民衆發表演說，籲請緬甸人民為準備達到他們的目的作最後的奮鬥，並特別鄭重指出，『革命並非為緬甸的眞正意願二』烏氏又稱：『此際尙不能預測倫敦英緬會談的成就；也許我們能得到我們的要求，但如果我們不能得到我們的要求，那末，我們必須準備决一行動。』現在烏氏己在赴英途中，無論英緬會談的結果如何，此一會議之得能召開的本身，己是令人喜慰的事；特別是在新年中我們看見有這喜訊的傳來</p>
<p>為什麽這消息是可喜的消息呢？這表示一個統治民族與一個被統治民族為了他們將來關係的調整，願以商談方式來解決所有的一切問題。這表示一個統治民族願以和平的方式家變更它所處的地位，以期滿足被統治民族的願望，同時，也表示一個被統治民族之願以和平方式來滿足他們的願望。這英緬商談的召開，本身就是協和精神的表現，是値得我們稱頌的。我們於此不得不盛讚艾德禮首相所抱政策的開明和緬甸領袖對於如何達成他們民族願望所取途徑的正當。在今日遠東局勢依舊動盪，各被統治民族的民族運動正在積團展開的時候，英緬會談的即將召開，實具有決定遠東各被統治民族前途的示範作用。我們相信英緬雙方旣有和平解決緬局的意願，則即將在倫敦召開的英緬會談前途定必成功。</p>
<p>此次英緬會談的召開，初由首相艾德禮於十二月二十日宣布於國會，定於一月，三日起舉行於倫敦。此一會談召開的宣布，正値印度代表齊集倫敦商討憲法之後，一時引起保守黨及其黨魁邱吉爾的尖銳批評，以為大英帝國的建立為英國人民數世紀來辛動努力的結果，不應讓工黨政府加速破壞於一旦。然而邱吉爾的獅子吼，初不能動搖工黨政府的決策；即就事實論，英國政府除幫助印度緬甸獲到獨立自主以外，也沒有別路可循。邱吉爾在南非曾從事於建立大英帝國的戰爭，目睹帝國的就傾，自不免要感觸多端。可是為英國本身的利益着想，現在而欲統治不甘被統治的民族，未必對於它本國有若何利益，且相反的，必將是它的一種負担。所以艾德禮政府此際而有開明政策的採取，允許印度緬甸人民滿足他們的願望，實是一種明智的決策，即對英國本身亦是有利的。大英帝國曾經過不少歷史的階段；自囚犯殖民地一直到如今高度自治，實即獨立的「道米寗」。其間經過不少變更。如果大英帝國有力量的話，這力量不產生在統治的嚴厲，面是在統治的放棄，此可見於加拿大，澳大利亞等地的如何盡忠於帝國，而英國木身又如何在放棄它對它們的統治中而得到它們新的支持。</p>
<p>緬甸自淪入英人統治以來，以當時英印當局昧於事理，將緬甸的統治劃歸新德里的印度政府，致使緬甸變為殖民地的殖民地，舉凡緬甸的社會經濟各方面，都蒙上一層很濃厚的印度色彩。這在緬甸是一處很不自然的發展。印度與緬甸雖地壞相接，但印度人民與緬甸人民不特有種族語言上的差別，抑且有歷史文化方面的殊異。早在太平洋戰爭發前，英政府就決定印緬分治而且準備予緬甸以「道米寗」的地位，不幸戰事突起，緬局至今迄未解決。如今英政府　旣有英緬會談的召開，而鳥安商氏於離緬赴英之際，又稱「革命並非為緬甸的真正意願，」則此次英緬會談的召開，或必能滿足緬甸人民的願望。</p>
<p>於此，使我們不能不聨想起的就是關於越南的局勢。自河內北圻一帶乏生武裝鬥爭以來，法政府　對於處理越南事件的態度一味取強硬政策。就在本月二日，據聨全社巴黎電訊，法國政府　發言人尚駁斥越南人民共和國總統胡志明所提和議，謂在目前狀態之下，實無法談判。可知法國政府猶以為高壓政策可以學平一切。這眞十足表現了過去帝國主義的面目；實在令人惋措。自於緬甸局勢之有新的展開，我們願法國當局對越南局勢的處置上也能够採取比較開明的政策，使越南局勢能够趨於穏定。此與遠東和平持久的維擊，所關匪輕。以進步自命的勃魯姆政府，應該不再有殘餘帝國主義的存留。</p>

<h3>美新國會法行首次會議　馬丁膺選眾院義長　籲請兩黨合作解決各問題　參議員比爾波賄選成為眾矢之的</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓三日專電〕美國第八十屆國會，本日正式開幕，參衆兩院議。於會中宣誓就職，並誓言將於今後兩年中，依據美國憲政處理國事。會塲分爲兩室，觀禮者達千人以上。國會開幕時，首先舉行祈禱儀式，繼而由各議員發表演詞，並提出甚多提案，此亦將爲今後若干月內調查及熱烈爭辯之主題。參衆兩院於正式典禮結束後，即將聽取杜魯門總統年終提出之國情報告。然美國政治之最大表演，見於參院比爾波去留問題，乃參院中於國會開幕日所提出之最大問題，使共他一切重要問題均爲减色。一般參觀者及外交人員席决均告滿座，彼等注意之對象，乃比爾波而非開幕儀式。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕美國第八十屆議會今日開幕，共和黨失勢十五載，今日始在呌囂聲中恢復衆院控制權，選舉馬丁爲議長，並提出减少所得稅二成爲第一項法案。參院於密蘇里州民主黨參議員比爾波宣誓就職時，大起騷動。比氏方行至欄前宣誓，爲埃達河州民卞黨參議員戴樂所阻，乃退回原席。戴氏提議不承認比氏之參議員資格，謂其證書染有舞弊汚點。南部各州民主黨參議員紛紛起立爲皮氏辯護，路易齊亞那州民主黨參議員奧佛登提議請比氏就職，雙方爭辯甚劇。午後俄亥俄州共和黨參議員塔孚脫提議打銷反對比氏之動議，以三十八票對二十票通過，新任共和黨全體參議員始得宣誓就職，比氏則須經參院規則委會審查其證書後方能就職。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓四日電〕美共和黨各參議員頃向民主黨少數黨提出最後通牒，謂民主黨議員倘再欲阻撓驅逐參議員比爾波出院一事，則將修改參院之議事程序。聞比爾波因恫嚇里一人並禁止黑人投票等情，遂引起參院調查委會之申斥，當時共和黨兩大參議員塔夫脫與莫斯曾謂辯論冗長，令人不耐，多數黨將不得已而修改議事程序。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓三日電〕美衆院新議長馬丁發表就職演說稱：政府應即停止干涉人民之私事，而由人民監察政府之制度應立即恢復。美國現行制度已使美國成爲有史以來最偉大之國家，美政府實無容納偏袒共產主義之制度者之餘地。要之，政府應减少經費，共和與民主兩黨允應通力合作云。當馬丁議長演說時，掌聲不絕，美國衆院充滿反羅斯靦及反共產主義之情緒亦可於此見之云。</p>
<h3>兩黨公開運動　修正勞工法</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓三日電〕美國兩大黨國會議員今日公開運動，以防止影響公衆健康或安全之罷工，如煤礦罷工之類。惟此項運動將遭過强烈反對，有紙織之勞工團體，及廣大之工業界，對於不准罷工或鎖閉工廠而强迫解決勞炎糾紛之一切提議，均將與以力爭。民主黨衆議員施密斯曾提出某種勞工法案，據稱，公衆利益必須重視，若太注意於勞工或工業界之特殊願望，未免錯誤。施氏法案中規定各種最重要之工業，如發生勞資糾紛，應强迫仲裁，禁止關店及整個工業之集體談判。共和黨議員五人另提一種辦法，規定影響公衆健康及安全之工業，宜實行强迫仲裁。據麻省議員赫德稱，我人深信此案之必要，捨是將無法保護公衆利益·强迫仲裁係由第三者解決兩造爭端，密歇根州共和黨參議員福開森則起草一案，將徑由勞動法院以解決勞資料紛，認爲强迫仲裁之議，其通過機會較少，不若僅以各種方法限制工會，而並不剝奪其罷工權利，此種法案較易通過。國會將在三個月以內，以某種方式修改勞工法，此事實際上已經確定，惟是否將禁止罷工，則爲另一問題。</p>

<h3>麥帥第三次　肅清日官紀</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山四日廣播：麥帥之第三次肅淸日本官紀命令，將於今日頒布，去年今日麥帥曾頒佈第一次命令，至今適爲一周年。一般人預料此次頒佈之命令將較以前頒佈者軍爲嚴峻，凡已被褫奪官職之日人，將被取消當選「傀儡」代議士之資格，同時其同血統親屬亦不得就任公職。</p>

<h3>日本內閣舉行　本年首次會議</h3>
<p>對內閣命運或州有所決定</p>
<p>〔中央社東京四日電〕日本內閣將於今日午後舉行本年首次會議，各方劉此會議均極重視，吉田首相可能於會中決定其內閡之命運，一般有力猜測，吉田可能立即全體辭職，以促成與社會民主黨組成聯合政府。日本報紙消息稱，吉田首相相信藉使各非政府黨人員去職，以强化內閣，並不能有助於改善目前日趨變化之經濟情形。渠信邀請反對黨組成聯合政府，乃唯一解決方案，蓋社會民主黨可能對激動之勞工運用極大勢力也。</p>

<h3>巴勒斯坦益緊張　英擬取強硬措置　克寗漢出任巴勒斯坦英軍司令　猶太秘密軍加緊活動</h3>

<h3>蘇聨一老焉　行乞積巨金</h3>
<p>〔聯合社莫斯科四日電〕今日報載，七十一齡莫斯科老丐伐西利埃夫多年在街頭行乞，現已積聚私財二十六萬盧布，該老丐原係僧侶，在莫斯科貝洛柯夫廣塲行丐，引人起疑，乃加調查，藉悉其人於一九三〇年至一九四〇年間曾爲集體農塲一農民，住於伏洛達城附近一村，不滿現狀，潛至莫斯科行乞，至今始被發覺。</p>
<h3>印度首都　德里風光</h3>
<p>德里是印度的首都，凡是到過那裏的人都覺得自由車特別多，在遠東方面可以首屈一指。每當上工或下班的時候，市街上自由車充斥，坐在軍上的人都是白色裝束，另具一種風味。　德里事實上是兩個城，就是新德里和舊德里，兩處相距五英里，但是其間並無明確的界綫，所以一個新來者是無從知道自己究竟在新城還是在舊城。兩處人口的總數，已接近一百萬人。</p>
<p>恢復常態</p>
<p>戰時的種種的軍事活動，已經隨戰爭的結束而雲消烟散。德里本來是美國中緬印戰區司令部的所在地，常時美軍雲集，現在是回國的回國，他調的他調了。曾有一時，史迪威將軍的司令部也設在那裏，但是他本人不常留在那裏，而喜歡到氣候較凉的重慶或者緬北叢林的帳幕中去居住。今日，德里僅剩有美國軍事人員的五十人，負責處理美軍剩餘物資。</p>
<p>城中心區許多白色的單層房屋，以前做過美軍司令部，現在已改爲英軍和民政府的辦事處。「寇松」營房戰時曾聞名一時，許多美國士兵曾在那裏汗流不息，勉度幾年的光陰。今日，這營房已改爲印度制憲議會的會所了。</p>
<p>自戰爭結束以來，印度若干地方的物價均見下降，惟有德里爲例外，生活程度非但不低，反有更見高漲之勢。</p>
<p>經堡珠寺</p>
<p>德里諸名勝中對於遊歷者最具吸引力者之一，當推「紅堡」。該堡係築於十五世紀年代，孔雀皇朝時代舉世聞名的黃金寳座，曾有一時就設在那裏·在這實座的後面，雕有孔雀二頭，其尾部嵌以金剛鑽·紅寳石，藍寳石……極華富麗堂皇之能事。另一具有特殊興味的建築，則爲「珠寺」，也是十五世紀的遺物，在回敎界中是極負盛名的。</p>
<p>新德里却是英國人所造成的，建築的式樣都是歐洲近代式，魏菲爾總督就在那裏管治着印度四百萬人民，大體上，印度人都承認他是一個好總督，同時也希望他是最後的一任總督。政府的建築華麗巨大，完全是印度色彩。所引以爲憾者，就是在這龐大建築物的周圍，麏集着成千櫐萬在譏餓線上掙扎的貧人。</p>
<p>褐色健美</p>
<p>印度地處赤道附近，日光强烈，因此白色的皮膚上，往往會蒙上一層油然的褐色。在歐洲各地，婦女以皮膚作褐色爲時髦，自以爲富於健康美。但在印度，却沒有人喜歡這種色彩，婦女出門，總把身體裹得緊緊的，以禦日光，其爲地理環境使然歟？抑爲有色人種之遭人鄙視使然歟？</p>

<h3>參議會各級召集人　昨日舉行聯席會議　決定議事日程　大會明晨揭幕　至昨日止收到提案五十八件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會各委員會召集人，昨日下午三時，在該會舉行第三次聯席會議，商討第二次大會議事日程並抽定議員席次。會議由議長潘公展主持，共到參議員二十六人。決議大會日程如下：</p>
<p>一月六日上午九時至十時，舉行紀念週及開幕式。十至十二時，第一次會議，市長施政報吿後，參議員提質詢。</p>
<p>七日下午二至五時，第二次會議，對警察，衛生，社會及教育等四局，提出實詢。</p>
<p>八日下午二至五時，第三次會議，關於財政，地政，公用，工務等四局提質詢。</p>
<p>九日上下午為第一及第二次小組審查會，審查各局報吿及提案，時間及地點均不規定，出各委員會自行決定，在前一日大會中報吿。</p>
<p>十日下午二至五時，第四次會議，討論提案。</p>
<p>十一日下午第五次會議，討論提案。</p>
<p>十二日下午第六次會議，討論市府卅六年度施政計劃。</p>
<p>十三日上午九至九時半，紀念週。九時半至十二時，第七次會議，討論卅六年度市總預算。十二時至一時舉行休會式。</p>
<p>該會第二次大會舉行開幕典禮時，將邀請中外來賓列席旁聽。</p>
<p>各參議員席次　業已抽籤決定</p>
<p>關於參議員席次，已於昨日聯席會議上，公推路式導，童行白，及沈鼎三參議員抽籤決定。聯席會並討論處理提案辦法。參議會截至昨日止，共收到提案五十八件，經決議，收集大會提案於本月五日截止，六日以後所收各案均作易臨時動議。同時採納王維騦參議員意見，各級委員會在審查報吿或提案時，應擬具一總報吿，並將各項議案分層最要，次要，須急辦者及緩辦者，然後提交大會討論，以資節省大會時間。又唐世昌參議員提議，審查議案，以後望能不以「酌量辦理」了之，當提出具體辦法以供市府當局，否則市府即可自定規章辦理，與大會決議之面目全非，失去大會精神，猶如當局處理限制電力及火化積極等案，均頗不公平。</p>
<p>本年度市預算　認為過於龐大</p>
<p>席間費樹聲參議員對於市府三十六年度預算發表意見，認為預算數目如此龐大，不合情理。若與南京比較，南京本年度預算僅二百餘追憶元。京市人中面積與上海比較為一與四之比，而上海市之預算，卻為一與十之比。故希望市府行政費應竭力減少，要求審查人員名額及其需要程度。潘議長為即報吿上次財政及預算二委員會聯席會議經過，認為對市府三十六年度預算，實有縝密考慮之必要。財政及預算二委會定今日再舉行會議研究此問題。關於市府訂閱施政法規，將通知市府注意。以後須經參議會審核後，方可公布施筆。</p>
<h3>施政及修訂法規　提議規定原則</h3>
<p>又龐京周參議員提出臨時動議，謂一般市民均認為市參議會接近市政府，並非代表民意，實感遺憾。市參議會今後務須明瞭本身責任，為市民服務，同情市民。故擬請規定本市最近市政措施曁修訂法規之基本原則，以為本屆大會議事範圍而副民望。其辦法略分：甲·關於市政與革事項，（一）與人民利益及生計有直接關係者先付討論。（二）美化市容及追求歐美大都市標準之建設，均請不議。（三）緊急工程中必須立即興工者，應特予研討。（四）市府預算應予低估人民之納稅能力，而手續尤須簡化。乙·關於修訂一般法規之精神，（一）原有法規行使有效者，應不使多予更改。（二）執行方法應意圖避免嚴峻。（三）單行管制法令及警章罰則皆宜以感化性為主。當經決議，辦法中甲項請預算委員會採納，乙項請法規委員會採納。</p>
<h3>揚州路菜販請願　請準予稍緩再遷</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市揚州路菜販，以榆林路警察局勒令遷移集中許昌路營業，而該地地處偏僻，影響年內生計昨日下午四時半特推派代表王金　雲等赴市參議會請願，要求延長至農曆年底後再予遷讓。當由該會推永祥雲參議員接見後，報吿聯席會討論，經通過准菜販所請，函警察局準予延至年底再遷。</p>
<h3>分級徵收筵席稅　酒菜業表示反對</h3>
<p>上海市酒菜商業同業公會及全市中西菜館五百二十家負責人，為擁護中央修正公布筵席及娛樂稅新法反對吳市長向市參議會所提議案將菜館依照營業設備分甲乙等級徵收筵席稅補充辦法，昨日發出緊急通吿，定本月六日上午八時，由全市各菜公會集中，準備於是日上午九時，赴市參議會舉行第二屆大會時向全體參議員請　。</p>
<h3>本市各私立醫院　籲請豁免捐稅</h3>
<p>本市各私立醫院為財政部及本市市政府征收滬市醫院營業稅及營利所得稅一事，然以勝利後滬市人口驟增，病人日眾，而醫院本慈善救濟之旨，收費極廉，貧病免費收治，以致經費異常困難，實屬無力繳納，特由上海市醫院聯合會聲述理由，分呈行政立法兩院曁財政部衛生署籲請豁免</p>
<h3>王仁珊自首經過　呈報國防部</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕後勤司令部第一補給區江灣軍械醫療隊爆炸案要角該庫分庫長王仁珊，於元旦日深夜投案自首後，連日經有關當局偵訊結果除據王供係因畏罪逃匿，曾赴冀省濮陽等情外，並無其他新發現。據悉協助偵查之警備司令部滬東稽查所，將根據王仁珊所供各節，向有關方面調查證責。第一補給區司令部則已將王之自首經過，呈報國防部，必要時並將解送南京查辦。至本案之全部結束，尚待在逃管庫員吳汝鐮，陳翰文兩人之歸案云。</p>
<h3>中英航郵　一週可到</h3>
<p>據郵局消息：去英國郵件，現由中國航空公司飛機自滬運至加爾各答後，交由英國海外航空綫接運至倫敦中航機每週二班，英國機每週達八班，故上海去倫敦之航空郵件，需時僅五天至七天，異常迅速。是項航空機除帶運去英國各地航空郵件外，凡去歐洲其他各國包括蘇聯在內之郵件，亦可帶運至倫敦後轉發各國，惟需貼足去英國之航空郵費（現為每五公分國幣六五〇元）。又去蘇聯之航空郵件，倘寄件人仍願照以前辦法發交哈阿線（哈密至蘇聯之阿拉木力）運遞，可於信封封面上註明（By　Hami—Alma　Ata　Air　Line）等字樣，郵局亦可照辦。</p>
<h3>防免學校中傳染病　訂定管理規則八項</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕衛生局決於本年度起，加強學校衛生之推進。為避免傳染病在校中蔓延起見，特會同教育局，訂定管理學校傳染病規則，對於患傳染病學生，令其暫停入校，並規定其隔離時間如下：（一）水痘：應至乾痂完全脫落為止。（二）白喉：入院一星期後，應經過二次連續鼻喉之分泌物培養，均證明陰性者。（三）痳疹：最少須隔離四星期。（五）猩紅熱：亦須隔離四星期。（六）天花：須待痘痂完全脫落之後。（七）百日咳，流行性腦脊髓膜炎，急性脊髓灰白炎，昏睡性腦炎等：應至少隔離六星期。（八）傷寒及副傷寒：應經過三次連續大便培養，均證明陰性者，方可返校照常上課</p>

<h3>各校昨照常上課　僅交大等少數學生仍四出宣傳　大同學生自治會發表嚴正聲明</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕北平美軍污辱我大學女生一事，本市學生界同表憤慨，日前各大學會先後發表宣言表示抗議，並促請政府提出交涉要求懲兇，同時因此事純係法律案件，應循正當外交途徑解決，故並不主張採取罷課手段或其他題外興動，以免增加困難而荒廢學業，但亦有少數學生自動組織「抗議美軍暴行委員會」發動罷課遊行，冀區擴大事態。</p>

<h3>回國失業工人　招待所中生活　吃飯睡覺中排遣了今天　渺茫期望下等待着明天</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕過去被日人誘騙強征，或俘擄轉運國外做苦工的工人，現在都陸續回國了。人行萬里半天下，有的在北海道一帶的雪山煤礦中做工，有的在南洋，緬甸，澳洲一帶充當苦役，出生入死，流血流汗，飢餓凍餒和鞭韃是他們的日常功課，經過了這一段暗無天日的非人生活，他們又重新回到了祖國，他們的生命，似乎是從死神的工魔掌中拾來的。</p>
<p>這一批工人，回國以後，由港口司令部送至救濟分署，再由救濟分署轉送至「歸國失業工人招待所」收容，招待所自去年四月一日成立以來，首先收容了由日本回國的工人八十餘人。其後流落在澳洲緬甸一帶的工人亦相繼回國。前後總共收容了三百多人。其中一百多人業已遣送回鄉或介紹職業，尚餘一百六十餘名，留住所中。招待所的經費由市府撥發，一部分食品和衣物由善後救濟總署供給。所中有大小房間三十餘處，每間住五六人至七八人不等。他們的生活，除掉每日三餐外，其餘的時間就是閒坐和睡覺，房裏光綫不好，空氣混濁，鋪蓋什物等堆積凌亂，可是對於他們，總算是經過了長期苦難後暫時的蘇息了。</p>
<p>蘇息儘管蘇息，他們到底還需要工做，除掉十幾個女工以外，他們大部分是身強力壯的男子，這一種呆滯刻板的生活，實在是精力的浪費。</p>
<p>他們希望在祖國得到一份家業，得到一個職業，然而他們的家屋已經摧毀了，有家歸不得，他們的職業更覺得渺渺茫茫，這一份拾來的生命並不是幸福的，以後還有着無數的波折和苦難。</p>
<p>他們的唯一目的，就是尋找工作，然而他們缺少專門技能，又値國內工商業不景氣的時候，人浮於事，舉步艱難，他們只有在吃飯睡覺中排遣每一個今天，在渺茫的期望中，等待着每一個明天。</p>
<p>招待所的設立是値得稱讚的，然而它缺少一種合理的組織，缺少一種積極的動力，假如把這些工人的力量，轉移到生產上，國內還不致沒有需用人力的地方，假如他們缺少專門技能，應當乘此時機，加強訓練，至少他們的生活，應當比較約有規律，有秩序，這似乎是招待所目前忽略了的一點。</p>

<h3>飛機失事與氣象　中央氣象局局長</h3>
<p>— 呂烔</p>
<p>上月份飛機失事，不幸得很，已有兩次。一决是上月十四日滬報載：</p>
<p>平滬航綫旅客機第XT-T26十四日午後，由京飛滬，携帶鈔票三十三箱，共十二億元，金子五箱，吉普一幗，四時抵長興，因氣候惡劣，無法續飛，似擬降落長興機塲，故在該縣上空盤旋數匝，但是時適遇狂風驟雨，天色昏黑，致與幷山相撞，機身着火，駕駛員及兩乘客悉數慘死，而機內所藏法幣，一部即隨風飄揚於十里內外……又中國航空公司六七號客機，亦於是日下午五時二士分自京飛滬，降落龍華機塲，因風勢過猛，致與塲內其他停留之飛機相撞，幸未肇大禍……</p>
<p>第二次飛機失事，是上月二十五日，滬報載：</p>
<p>二十五日本市（上海）鎭日細雨飄濛，濃霧密佈，入晚允甚，五尺之外，形影糢糊。由於這種氣候惡劣，在同時問內，竟有三架乘客飛機失事。其中兩架係自重慶飛滬的中國航空公司客機，一架爲中央航空公司客機。……中航公司一四〇飛機，因大霧濃密，找不到機塲，盤旋一小時餘，因機油用完，强近降落，轟然一聲，飛機衝地起火，機頭和飛機前身全部粉碎……中航公司另一客機一一五號，亦自重慶起飛，有乘客三十三人　抵達上海市上空時，因天氣太壞，竟爾隊毀於機塲外西南一英里黃家渡河廟塔。另外還有一架中央航空公司C四八號客機，亦於是晚因天氣惡劣，被迫降落滬北江　機塲，以濃霧難辨，方向越出機塲，撞落張華浜附近一農家，起火焚燒</p>
<p>我們分析這兩次飛機失事的天氣情况，十四日那天是一次强烈的寒潮（亦即是冷氣團）南下，因此風狂雨驟，飛機操縱失靈，原因在於風力太大，加以天色昏黑，中央機竟與山岳相撞，中航機在降落時，與其他地而停留之飛機相撞。那天南京天氣亦是非常惡劣，東北風强大，不適宜於飛行。至於二十四日的天氣情形，係在暖面（Warm　front）之中，風勢雖平靜，雨勢亦不强，但微雨濛濛，濃霧漫天，視度（Visibility）極壞，亦不適宜於飛行。</p>
<p>我國飛航失事，十之七八，由於天氣不利，猶憶今年三月中戴雨農先生自靑島飛京，因天氣惡劣，在江陰的板橋鎭附近墜毀，東失生命。但由於天氣條件不利，並不是不可避免的。只要可以知道當日全國天氣大勢，就可以判別本日天氣是吾適宜飛行。大致不適宜於飛行的天氣，不外乎下列數種：（一）强大寒潮南下，因風力太大，飛機操縱不易。此種天氣，在冬半年中（Wniter　helfyear）較易發現，尤以冬季爲甚。寒潮剛過，風勢雖殺，但如高空氣溫過低，飛行仍須小心，因飛機翼上有結冰之危險，尤以向東北或西北航行，須格外注意，因冬季北方溫度較南方爲低。（二）暖面降臨，風雨雖並不强大，但濃霧蔽天，視度惡劣，飛機最易迷失方向，不易找見機塲，此種天氣，冬春最多。（三）夏季雷雨，不宜飛行，理由甚顯，無須說明。（四）颱風範圍內，自亦不宜飛行，因風雨過驟，操縱不易，此種天氣在夏秋間，最易發生。此外山岳地區，冬季濃霧較多，濱海之區，冬春夏各季均可有霧，要看它的地位而定。上述云云，皆係我國氣象常識。至於保護飛機的治本之道，當然單靠氣象常識是不够的，要在全國廣設氣象測站，迅速傳遞氣象通訊，逐日繪製天氣圖二或三次，如能增加次數，常然更好，在每一飛機塲上，宜設置一氣象站，每站的需用氣象人員十餘人，並須有高級人員主持天氣報告。此外飛機駕駛人員，亦宜灌輸以基本氣象常識，使他們自己瞭解普通天氣演變的情形，有所警戒，不致冒險。歐美各國早經如此辦理，故由於天氣原因而致飛航失事者，已不多見。一日之內，飛機三架失事，實在太慘了。如果國家多化一點錢，辦一點氣象事業，因而每年少跌毀幾架飛機，减少若干生命財物的損失，我相信並不是得不償失，而且功效可以立見的。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>讀者咨詢　法筆質問</h3>
<p>（一）脅迫遷讓</p>
<p>歸芸問　我是個三房客。在二年之前向二房東租下了二間房子，當時定期一年，付了押租六個月，期滿後又加租繼續居住，半年後又加房租，再訂六個月口頭租約，事實上已成了不定期租的，但現在租約還未滿期（房金是先付六個月的）二房東竟在大房東允諾他搬塲費與不追欠租的優越條件下，準備搬塲了，他竟一定要逼我出屋，我則一時無法覓堡，所以成爲僵局，這裏有幾點疑問，擬請解答：（一）在蘇州，對租賃房屋沒有特別規定，現在找覓不着房子不能搬讓，不知可再住幾時？（二）卅三年九月曾預付押租六個月，現在提出要求住退押租，在法律上有吾抵觸？（三）契的期滿後，以後一直沒有改訂新約，每次加房錢付房金時僅不過在原租摺上註明吧了。所有該約上載明的條件，是否可以不負責任？保證人是否亦可不負責任？（四）假若期滿後，我仍付房金，二房東不收時，可吾把應付的房金交存銀行？以作法律上交涉的準備。</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師簽〕（一）如租約確未滿期在合法租賃之下，强迫承租人搬遷，可控以强暴脅迫遷讓罪。（二）不能作為續租理由。（三）應視為以不定期限繼續契的，保證人可不負責任。（四）應依法向法院　請提存。</p>
<p>遺產繼承</p>

<h3>政府購餘紗布　各廠雖可自由出售　但不許任意抬價　否則即下令全部收購　宋院長昨對棉紡業切實表示</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕行政院宋院長，於昨日下午三時，在外灘中行大厦行政院辦事處，召集第六區機器棉紡織工業同業公會全體理監事，舉行談話會，到王啓字，榮鴻元，束雲章，吳味經，郭棣活，劉國鈞，奚玉書等共十八人。經濟部王部長，紡管會吳兼主委，業務處長劉文勝等，亦出席。首由務管會吳兼主委報告：爲穩定紗布市價，迭次與六區棉紡公會洽商經過，及紡管會召開會議情形，主要者有二點：（一）決定收購上海市區各紗廠存棉生產量百分之五十。（二）評定最優級廿支標準紗，每件價爲一百九十七萬五千元。吳兼主委報告旣畢，宋院長即面詢六區公會理事長王啓宇，公會中各同業，對紡管會所議定之新議價，有無意見？王氏常答稱：各同榮對新議價，均表滿意。</p>
<p>宋院長於聆取王氏答語後，頗表欣慰，並稱：由此可見各同業俱能與政府合作，而政府對紡織工業，實已較對其他工業特別優待。除利潤已規定百分之廿外，政府同時尚須供給購買外棉所需之鉅額外匯。現政府雖決定收解紗布半數，惟尚餘半數，仍將仍由各廠自由在市塲上出售。惟希望該自由出售之半數紗布，須顧及穩定物價之方策，不能放任勝漲。此緣紗布價格，對其他物價之影響頗大。且政府原來之意，將收購全部紗布。茲者僅收購其半數，其意即將此收購之半數，以控制紗布之市價。設以後紗布市價，仍有跳漲情形，則政府尚可隨時下令收購全部紗布，故希望大家合作，此其一。又各廠曾要求祇繳二個月存棉之生產量予政府，宋院長託爲硬性限期之規定，似有未公，政府決定仍按各廠實際存棉之生產量，收　其半數，此其二。今後紗廠情形，定能發展。將來不論外紗價格如何低廉，政府決不使之進口，俾便保護我國紡織事業之利益及發展。</p>
<p>最後王部長表示：各廠自由出售之牛數紗布，其價格不能太高。同時望各廠應注意生產成本，例如對工人工資，及職員待遇，不能漫無限制，予以優待。生產成本設能减低，方能與外紗競爭。旣得之盈利，不應即加分配，應用以擴充本身之設備。設如不顧成本，使職工待遇過優，則將影響其他工業云。</p>
<h3>實銷見殷金價上漲　結果較封關前高七萬</h3>
<p>烚赤昨央行明配之外，暗售甚少，封關期中，實銷抵補，　　堅定，晨開一躍而爲三五五萬，自三五八萬起，即有獲　了結者，立告盤跌至二五〇萬大關內，低價達三四六萬而　　定，十時後，央行以三四八萬之價，配給二〇二條，入　央行壓力甚微，銀樓以及各地實銷見殷，復回升至三五六萬，近午在三五二萬迄三五五萬之間盤旋，午後即交又扳高至二五八萬而後見定，結果校封關前漲起七萬，飾金三十七萬五，銀元稍貴，暗息在一角半至一角八間。</p>
<p>外幣昨甚爲平穩，美鈔暗盤晨初在六千三至六千五間，後點六千二至六千四間，午後因金市現交趨昂而帶上少許，復在六千三至六千五間徘徊，較封關前微穩。港票曾隨金價升　一二八〇元，最後一二五〇元有售，結果亦好起數十元。　匯一一七〇元至一二〇〇元，印匯一四〇〇元，英匯一八八〇〇元左右，除港隨在一一八〇元左右，較多成交外，餘者仍屬有行無市。</p>
<h3>公債微挫</h3>
<p>公債昨亦略見回挫，統丙晨開一四五〇元，六五二室雖納，三六〇室則售自一四六〇元起，見挫至一四二〇元以下，結果較封蘭前收回跌一三〇元，甲乙亦跌一〇〇元，統丁平而統戊則升二十元，成交約三百餘萬元。</p>
<h3>四十二支雙股綫　狂跳近念萬</h3>
<p>昨日紗市紅盤步步高升，晨初以低價開盤，各方冒胃殊勁，念支紗冉冉上漲三五萬元，卅二支更俏，約好十萬之譜，四十二支雙股綫最爲挺秀，在單純織廠搜求下，在跳念萬之譜，趨勢堅定，人心欣然向榮。</p>
<h3>茶市仍無起色</h3>
<p>昨日起各業均照常上市，茶市本街店號及客莊各路去化依然奄無生氣，至於洋莊交易，仍以銷往法屬非洲一帶之抽珍珍眉等綠茶，最呈活潑，售價亦極俏利，英商仁記洋注視視不懈之高檔陳祁門，在賣戶一味以貨稀居奇下，過程未見明朗，行情屹立有勁。其他花色，續乏起仆。茲據業中人云：目前日本方面，猶擬積極準備以二批新茶競銷非洲加薩勃蘭加等地，如能實現，則華茶益將受其打擊云。</p>
<h3>糖價轉升</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢轉企，均見回好，公會劃盤現貨中砂白爲十四萬一·二·三·四千元，棧單十三萬三·四·五·七元，生砂赤十二萬七千元，六千五百元至七八千元，棧單十二萬元至十二萬二千元，其中棧單升度較高，達五六千元，其他號貨亦堅，順德靑開十一萬八千元至十二萬元，提靑呌十二萬五千元，黃崗靑十二萬元至十二萬二·三千元，刁靑呌十二萬五千元，車白精二十一萬，車白蜜十七萬五千元，興化白十六萬九千元至四五千元，興赤十五萬七千元至十六萬二千元。</p>
<h3>粗紗定價太高　比例另行推算</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於穩定紗布市價方案六點，自經紡管會通過，並經宋院長核定後，業於本年一月一日，開始實施，目前正由紡管會與六區棉紡公會洽商收購手續及辦法。收購價格，亦已呈請宋院長核定，以最優級廿支標準紗每件一百九十七萬五千元爲準。至其他各級紗支價格，以原定計算比例，對粗支紗之定價太高，於實際情形不合，故決將由束雲章，王啓字，吳味經，劉文勝等，於今日會商後，另定各支紗推算價格之百分比云。</p>
<h3>地下錢莊不標絕　資金逃港不阻止　金融難好轉</h3>
<p>據金融界權威人士談稱，於此全面不景氣聲中，金融界營業穩健行莊，皆在較多盈餘中度遇，綜觀去年情况，下半左因受工商業不景氣，外貨傾銷，地下錢莊高利貸吸收游資，及炎金大批逃往香港等打擎，金融業務不及上半年之繁榮，目前當局雖嚴禁地下錢莊及游資逃港，然各方仍以油滑秘密方式，進行此等不良業務，今年金融界是吾能較堅去年進步繁榮，尚未能預測，當視此兩種不良營業之取締效果，及工商界接受貸款後能否轉機活躍爲定，總之，端賴當局之決策是否能收效果云。</p>
<h3>絲綢市況堅定</h3>
<p>停市三日之絲鋼市况，昨市頗形穩定，無甚變化，廠經喊價依舊未更，D字等級四百八十萬元左右，開口貨另祖四百五十萬元之譜，干經另担討價三百念舊元，未竹做開，人造絲一二〇號有光價比較略好，旭字　子做價三百十八萬元，高山牌子十六七憲元，比封關前大起五六萬元，其餘半光等貨俱無做開，喊價亦皆堅定，綢市頗形靜寂，廠盤大都堅持原價，華中縐昨仍做三千四百五十元至五百元之間。</p>
<h3>綫粉干回升</h3>
<p>綫粉干前以銷稀，略見回鬆，茲本市年貨去化轉增，價乃復升，昨市高貨能口粉開價好起二三萬元，已達三十五六萬元。</p>
<h3>米市紅盤高漲　秈米竟少正式市面　雜爆裂豆餅升沉不一</h3>
<p>米市昨爲新年紅盤交易，到源南北兩市共計九千石左右，因歲首休業三天，店方進胃較殷，兼以陰雨，人心向榮，南北粳均一致高漲二三千元，白元正値消令時期，去化轉暢，回漲二三千元，陰元俏利，亦漲三四千元，秈米貨稀，仍少正式市面，黃豆亦因本街收吸頗濃，價升一二千元，菉豆到消兩淡，無甚榮辱，赤豆挺硬，苞米供朮背道而馳，檳而不開，脚地頗固，芝蔴廣帮進取甚力，續漲三四千元，生仁廣方納胃亦爽、繼續步漲五六千元，豆餅汕頭厦門建州台灣均有成交，內地及申方油廠均有供源，形居到消兩旺，油價則升沉不一，生油靑島來貨獨多，簍生油回跌二三千元，豆油先堅後疲，結果與客歲收盤彷彿，淸油亦無上落，惟蔴油因貨稀消活，挺升三五千元，麵粉因廠方工潮未決，工作暫停，來貨稀少，店胃甚貪，市價上漲二二千元，麩皮帶升一二百元。</p>
<h3>絲織業聨營公司　資金已募四億　工貸核准四十五億</h3>
<p>絲織業產銷聯營公司微募資金，定後日截止，目下徵得資金已超出四萬萬元，距原定目標已甚接近，聞本市各絲織，織綢廠等，幾全部參加，該公司將於最短期內召集參加各廠商代表人聆取建議，以便發展業務。並聞該業原請求之工貸一百五十萬萬元，現已由中交兩行核貸四十五萬萬元，餘數於最短期內，亦可貸出云。</p>
<h3>華股掉期交易多　商務上市即跌停</h3>
<p>華股昨上塲，交易未見開展，市况冷落，浮多之隨金市爲進退者，過於擁擠，紗布帮大戶忽來了結一部份，近午突告慘落，前途未許樂觀，掉期貼價自三十元有人貼進起，陸續降低至二十二元左右，日息不到一角半，金融界若興業新華通商等咸有貼進，紗布證劵兩帮多頭以及生大等均在二十七元左右，如數掉轉，是以情况十分平靜，晨開因金市見秀之故而高，開後即有獲利出籠者，一七七號售現永紗，一九八號七六號四七號一五二號售遞永紗，盤低至現交六一七元，遞交六四三元，十時後，金市復穩，一四五號進現永紗，二三二號亦進，曾回漲十餘元，麗安百貨由三一號掛漲停，惟因廣帮一五五號力售現永紗，漲勢屢被阻折，一五二號二一二號四七號咸有脫售，仍告不振，商務由一六〇號售至跌停，惟中途因金布極堅而頗多散戶維持，十一時半後，一六號一三七號二一二號四七號均售現永紗，二一二號四七號亦售遞永紗，近午浮多紛斬，幾以低價結束，結果較對開前計永紗信和各跌百分之三四，景福勤興微拙，華豐平平，新光美亞各跌一成弱，冷股火柴微升，餘尚平定，遞交永紗華豐微挫，信和跌半成弱，新光跌一成弱，塲外各股閘北微昻，南洋小挫外，餘均平定。</p>
<p>外股昨金市之助力，僅能見秀少許，怡紗七一五〇元成交後，新買觀望之下，除會德豐銅業尚形微升外，餘者或告小挫。</p>
<h3>外貨壓迫之下皂燭廠危殆</h3>
<p>本市皂燭業，去年度受外貨大量進口傾銷中，業務一蹶不振，目前五十餘家，有半數已陷於停頓，昨據該業公會理事長梁嵩齡稱：關於該業製皂生產量爲（一）肥皂一五〇萬箱，每箱四十六磅，總歟六百九十萬磅，（二）香皂三〇萬箱，每箱三十磅，總數九十萬磅，所需原料，牛油佔百分之八十，椰子油百分之二十，燒碱佔百分之十八，鹽百分之五，燃料共四萬八千七百五十担，欲求增加生產，必需政府協助，供給原料，尤以燒碱需要最爲迫切，此外尚賴貸放鉅額費金，改善營業稅征收，能照資本額課稅，勿以營業額計算征稅標準，至製燭原料，亦甚需用，如外貨洋燭能予限制進口，則國貨製燭始有生機。</p>
<h3>中紡人造絲牌價　較市價低三成</h3>
<p>中國紡織建設公司，新年假期屆滿，昨晨該公司業務處首决人造絲掛牌，較市價抑低三成，價格如下：（一）素繭，二八吋，白色，每码二千七百元，（二）絹絲紡，卅六吋，白色，每碼四千五百元，（三）綿綢，廿九吋，米色，每碼二千八百元。</p>
<h3>呢羢到貨湧旺　交易到異常清淡</h3>
<p>邇日毛織品呢羢銷路，因氣節關係，兼種種環境，太街客帮需要均寂，零躉交易淸淡，前向國外所定之貨，刻則相繼運到，來勢之盛，堪稱一年以來所罕見，惟許可證簽出頗慢，行號商方英不抱憾，現在新向國外定貨者，已極寡乏，故申市行情，除厚貨外，薄貨已先後趨挺。</p>
<h3>中暹航綫開闢成功　海列輪載峭三千噸</h3>
<p>昨據國營招商局消息：上月中旬行駛中遠航綫處女航之海列輪，業已完成其光榮任務，航程共爲十八日，該輪巳在受谷裝載三千噸暹米運滬，該批食米爲我國向暹邏訂購洋米三萬噸之一部，故今後洋米來源益將充沛。本市民食供應，可無虞缺乏。按我國航輪在抗戰前，僅行駛南北洋及長江等航綫，且頗遭外商排擠，勝利後除上海至馬尼刺一地之中菲航綫，業已有海厦輪行駛外，我國與暹邏間之航綫開闢，亦已順利完成，誠爲我航業史上之創舉云。</p>
<h3>紐約銀價下跌</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約一日電〕今日紐的方面售出之白銀，爲數約達一五〇·〇〇〇盎司，每盎司美金八三分，反映售賣人當此需求平靜之際，肆力脫售年關存貨，各消費工廠在正月六日以前，不致恢復工作。</p>
<p>又訊：金銀業導經紀人韓第哈門公司今日復將該公司之紐約白銀價格减低美金一分，刻每盎司售價爲八二又四分之三分。</p>
<p>又訊：最近銀價下挫之際，紐的白銀之每日銷路，平均在一〇〇，〇〇〇盎司左右，兜售數量，每日則的爲二〇〇，〇〇〇盎司，至前數週中國·印度·英國及近東運來紐約應市之大批外國白銀，購買人迄無續求購買之表示，此等白銀大多數均係遠期貨色，且須加以精練，故此問顯然無人取納。某美國白銀消費人曾向近東方面求購，數量頗爲可觀之外國綪鍊貨色，但迄未獲答復。刻西班牙銀幣六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎司，正準備提練。據愁西班牙銀幣三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎司左右，業已運往英國綪鍊。查此等下游趨勢，係在銀器製造商停止收購時，方經宣佈者。該時彼等業已製就聖誕節之應市物品，從而淸除工廠，减少貨品種類，賣出大量碎銀。但貿易方面咸盼消費人能迅即恢復正常之每日採購量。</p>
<h3>中央合作鑫庫　滬分庫明日開業　全國分支庫已成立多處</h3>

<h3>日繭繼續運華　仍盼談判成功</h3>
<p>據中蠶公司總經理葛敬中氏談稱，關於東京麥帥總部傳况日本乾繭運華，可繼續談判事，迄目前止，該公司尚未有所聞，惟目前我國各地繅絲廠因原料不足，已紛紛停工，該批日繭縱能談判成功，運來我國，亦至少需時二月，即春節以後，彼時我國自產之乾繭亦已供應，故實無多大需要，惟果能價廉物美，經我國檢騐屬實，則仍歡迎其運售我國云。</p>

<p>潘議長表示　私校須收費</p>
<p>潘議長表示本市國民學校之敎育經費，全部由政府負担，則年需八百億元，市政府所擬本年市預算爲二千三百億元，如依憲法規定，百分之卅五爲敎育經費，則可能維持，無奈本市目前尚未能負荷此鉅額捐稅，故私校不能不收學費，以維敎師生活。最後蔣紀周聲稱：私校敎師，本學期生活較爲安定，工作效能及興趣已有長足之進步，下學期五十萬元之待遇，頗爲公道，惟市校敎師下學期待遇僅三十四萬元，希望市參議會及市政府籌劃市校敎師福利金每人每月十六萬元，則市校敎師生活，亦可安定。並聞私立中小學聯合會，根據此項標準，規定下學期收費數額云。</p>

<h3>臺省敎育視察團　程時煃等將返滬　盛讚臺小學員生研究精神</h3>
<p>〔本報台北四日電〕敎育視察團程時煃等一行，今開座談會，對合國民敎育員生硏究精神，均極贊許，七日返滬。</p>
<h3>甲組第二循環主力戰　東華青白再相逢　天雨是否舉行請聽廣播</h3>
<p>足球聯賽，昨日原有甲組龍傑對優游等四塲，因天不作美終日下雨，乃一律改期，今日續有聯賽及幼級盃各五塲，惟其中鐵路及蘇聯乙之賽，因晋元公園塲地積水，決予展期，僅餘九塲交鋒，如遇天時陰雨，觀衆可於中午十二時，收聽靑年文化電台（週波一二二〇公尺），上海電台（週波九〇〇公尺）廣播，或電話詢問逸園，中正公園，及足球委員會。</p>
<p>今日甲組第二循環一塲，華人兩巨頭東華重逢靑白於逸園，下午二時半舉行，裁判吳守衡，巡邊陳吉祥黃仁彝，門票二千及五千，在市體育館發售。</p>
<p>東華自出師以來，五戰五勝，領袖羣雄，錦標希望濃厚，靑白除首循敗於東華外，並兩和優游，冠軍前途黯淡，但爲報復計，必全力以赴，是以此戰仍不失爲精彩之戰。</p>
<p>東華　搽搭配整齊</p>
<p>搭配整齊東華陣容昨由隊長賈幼良公佈，莊友仁已返滬決出任後衛，餘與前週對猶太時相同，邦倫門守，林根輔助阿莊中衛，福楨龍波，及洽興前鋒，阿戴仍掛帥印，左爲錦順李垚，右爲龍海幼良，搭配整齊，當可再獲勝利。</p>
<p>青白　陣綫殘缺</p>
<p>靑白陣容因瞿永福羅壽福在港，費春華受傷未愈，故仍以痛備員黃振東，張仁義，姜關淸塡補陣綫，但後衛有嚴士鑫吳祺祥一對鐵閘，前鋒有李義臣宋靈聖顧以撒三劍客，戰鬥力仍屬可觀。茲將今日秩序錄後：</p>

<h3>大專籃球精彩一幕　大同劇戰勝交通　學院組法政擊敗同德</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大專籃球聯賽，昨日午後三時起，在市體育舘開始角逐，原定三塲，學院組法政對同德，女子組體專對交大，學字組交大對大同，惟其中女子組交大隊臨時缺席，判作棄權，改由女靑與體專舉行友誼賽。昨日天雨，然觀衆到有二千餘人，壓軸戰交大戰大同，表演極爲精彩，觀衆吶喊助威，情緒熟烈，實爲大學籃球聯賽從來未有之盛况。</p>
<p>法政戰勝同德</p>
<p>首幕戰，學院組法政對同德，裁判李震中，祝明星，笛聲響後，雙方佈陣極嚴，歷時達六分鐘，記分牌上仍爲鴨蛋兩隻。同德中鋒戴晋覓機躍起，托入一球，首創記錄。法政前鋒查景山不甘示弱，送入一球，第一節五比四，法政差同德一分。第二節開始，雙方仍相差極微，谷七平手後，同德曾以十一比十佔先，後法政項庭　，孫震麟，分頭遠射建功，前半時遂以十四此十一後來居上。易陣再戰，法政攻勢驟緊，同德僅獲得二分，法政則增至三十三，最後一節，同德莊仁安雖一再遠射中的，然大勢已去，結果法政以四十四比三十三戰勝同德。</p>
<p>女子表演</p>
<p>第二幕女子組，交大棄權，改由女靑年曾籃球隊與體專作友誼比賽，女靑嬌小玲瓏，體專組壯力大，結果體專以二十比十四小勝女靑。</p>
<p>大同一路佔先壓軸戰，交大對大同，交大隊近在國手李震中指導之下，頗爲進步，惜開始時未施用人釘人法，且攻勢遲緩，屢爲大同所乘。大同王伯文首開紀錄，林維聰，徐仲已相繼破籃，交大沈被軍，倪志琦力追，第一節終，大同以二十比中二領先。第二節交大雖沉着作戰，然大同徐仲已身大手長，林維聰滿塲飛奔前半時結果，交大仍以十八比廿六落後。</p>
<p>交通力戰受挫</p>
<p>易陣再戰，交大改變戰略，曾追成三十一之平局，大同主將徐仲已五次犯規出塲，快腿林維聰大有孤掌難鳴之勢，然第三節大同仍以四十比三十五領先。最後一節，交大沈被章連續建功，大同林維聰又犯規畢業，交大僅以一球差於大同，交大鑒塲於終不遠，傾力猛襲，大同陣內，倍受威脅，大同王伯文於塲終前，運中三元，奠定勝局，時間完畢，交大以四十九比四十七，一球之差，見負於大同。</p>

<h3>整軍建國光明面　從消耗到生產·化破壞為建設</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　房滄浪</p>
<p>我國勝利已經年餘，但因內亂不已，交通未復，農事半廢，工業凋　，國內至少還有二萬萬以上的人民，在飢餓綫上苦命掙扎，這現象的確令人苦惱，失望，現當急景凋年，有織之士，對於目前財政，金融，工商業，各方表現的危機，允抱股憂，咸望內亂早日敉平，交通早日恢復，使一切被破壞的工礦事業，得以從速復興，俾政府整軍裁兵的大計，得遂行無阻，將那龐大驚人的巨額軍費，節省下來，移用於復興農村，救濟工商，振興一般敎育文化事業的正途，以解救當前經濟上之迫切危機，同時也應該使若干呻吟，震恐，疑懼於徵糧徵兵急政下之人民，稍獲喘息。這不是奢望，這確是一般憂國憂時志士們的眞知灼見。在農村破產，工商交困的今日，如果我們的整軍裁兵，我們這個化破壞為建設，變消耗為生產的建國大計，不能遂行，而仍習供養二百師以上之兵員，（依據最近報載。國共兩軍現有兵員）爭戰不已，我國經濟的前途眞不堪想像，然而所幸於失望之餘，還能從政府實施整軍大計的過程中，看到建國前途的一綫光明，這就是我們今年由秋迄冬，所看到和聽到的，南昌第六軍官總隊萬餘編餘軍官，在集訓期間，轉業前夕的各種表現。這一種編餘軍官轉業訓練的成就，如能蔚為風尙，普遍發現於中國每一個角落，我們深信不但我國將來因整軍裁兵所發生的一切軍事善後問題，不成間題，就是那些看不順眼，聽不顯耳，打戲館，衝妓院，毀車站的諸般打風，也許要由少而以至於無吧。</p>
<h3>軍官改業　青雲直上</h3>
<p>在去年十月勝利剛得砲聲方停勇於內戰的人們，正在乘機擴軍扒路毀礦爭降奪地的時候，明智的蔣主席終於不顧一切開始實行了他的整軍建國大計，當時協贊規劃這一整軍大計的高級將領有何敬之，白健生，陳辭修三位上將。在這時期序列第六軍官總隊的總隊部，在一稱史無前例的規模下，誕生於南昌郊外唯一名勝區的靑雲譜。建始的時期，是十月中旬，最初的名稱，是第九戰驅軍官總隊，開始收訓編餘車官，的為二千餘人。今年元月九日，戰區撤銷，改隸軍政部，始稱今名，當時收訓的第一期各軍師區編餘軍官，及在江西地區無職軍官，共達三千九百餘人，及至四月中旬，該總隊部之餘前總隊長，奉周回軍委會工作，遂以學術兼優，在湘北會戰，著有赫赫戰功之抗日名將，前卅二集國軍副總司令陳沛中將，接任該總隊部總隊長。陳氏先後曾畢業於軍校及陸大，在抗戰初期，即以死守金鷄嶺一役，見知於陳辭修，薛伯陵兩將軍。陳總隊長的特長，是堅忍，沉着，能與官兵同甘苦，而且不慕名利，是一位良好的軍事敎育人才，所以能獲得上級之信任，學員之愛戴。</p>
<h3>准尉與中將　多至一萬二千名</h3>
<p>陳氏接長第六軍官總隊後，不久又接收了第二十七軍官總隊及第二度收訓有軍校學籍之無職軍官五千餘人。到了七月底，這個第六軍官總隊，所收訓準備轉業的軍官，竟多至一萬二千人，為全國各軍官總隊之冠，寖寖乎成爲全國學員最多，學科最雜之軍事敎育大集團，而在這一個大集團受轉業訓練的軍官，他們的官階，從准尉到中將，應有盡有，而且他們大多是三九兩戰區身經百戰的將軍們，乃至專打前鋒的排長，連長和營團長。</p>
<h3>軍長排長　重度學校生活</h3>
<p>他們做夢也沒想到，在抗戰旣勝以後，馬上要將他們「編餘」，而且很迅速地將他們編入軍官總隊，不管你曾經幹過軍長，師長，或者連排長，一視同仁，來重度那最有規律的學校生活，接受那警政，文通，工鑛，農墾，土地測量，地方行政，衛生，勞働，民訓，敎育等諸般建國基幹訓練。截至九月初，由總隊部選送江西省訓團接受上述各科轉業訓練的軍官，計有二千一百餘人。送赴中央訓練　將官班，受訓的將官，計達八十餘人。受土地測量財政金融訓練，以及送往警官學校訓練的軍官，共的五百餘人。此外，尙有在抗戰期間，參加軍中文官工作的五百餘人，已遵命退職，就中頗多品端學粹的大學生及高中學生，現在繼　留隊的優秀軍官，經選派各軍師服務的，亦有五百餘人。目前留隊的軍官，尙剩六千餘人，內有一千五百人，正在辦理第一次退役，其餘則在加强轉業淮備中，預計至本年底以前，可以各就新崗位，從事各部門建國工作，以達成復員之目標。</p>

<p>總隊環境之佈置</p>
<p>各單位駐地，在顯著之處，均恭繪主席巨幅肖像，以資敬仰。</p>
<h3>主席蒞校　讚詡總隊成就</h3>
<p>自從　蔣主席於秋初，親蒞南昌，檢閱該總隊全體受訓軍官，並於南昌各界歡迎主席大會塲上，根據江西各界暨省參議會正副議長若干紳嘗之報吿，公開讚揚該總隊偉大之成就，及優良之軍風紀後，第六軍官總隊的盛譽，已傳遍全國，關心中國重事復員問題的一般智識份子，亦衆信政府所訂的軍事善後辦法，已獲得相當成功。但是這一個過去集中一萬二千名軍官於南昌靑雲譜附近，方廣三十華里以內，就簡　之設備，以有限之時間，完成如此複雜艱鉗之軍官轉業訓練工作，眞不知耗去該總隊陳總隊長，兩位張總隊附，一位李總隊附，以及數百將校敎官若干心血與腦汁，而其成功的因素，則在精神敎育之澈底，與夫勞作制度運用之得當。據若干受訓之軍官吿記者云：他們入隊受訓之初，大家因懷着滿腔牢騷，勉强而來，大家心裏總不免有點難受。後來因鑒陳總隊長，諸事以身作則，財政率先公開，多為其人格所感動，加之，該總隊日久已養成白覺，自動，自治之精神，人人知恥力學，知難力行，所以雖在例假之日，學員亦多在隊，自修自募，甚少出外遊樂，所以在南昌任何公共娛樂塲所，鮮有學員吵鬧打架情事發生。軍人在一個人口相當眾多的省會，而無　佔民房，強看白戲，歐震良民乖類有玷軍風紀等事件乏生，處今之日，也可雨是難能可貴了。</p>
<h3>軍中佳話　五世同堂</h3>
<p>此外，關於這個軍官總隊的軍官們，在受訓期間的一些趣聞逸事，也値得向讀者們報道一番。他們在上課的時候，有時發現四世同堂或五世同堂的佳話，有好多連排長發現他們過去的營長，團長，師長，甚至軍長，和他們在一起受訓，感到莫大的興趣，和異常的親切，這樣的集訓辦法，的確在古今中外，史無前例。所以像這樣的一種牢騷集團，不久終於無間老幼，不分尊卑，陶鎔於一座偉大崇高的建國事業洪爐中，各隨所好，各擇所需，自然而愉快地，鍜成若干建國新人材。雖然當茶一時期，需要在受訓學員中，遴選一批適合到東北或者是蘇魯等地，為維持地方秩序，保護民衆利益，而重溫軍中生活，偶然使他們發生一點疑問：「咦上才說建國，爲什麼又單單的呌我們幾個帶兵打仗去呢？」但是，一經那誠懇率眞和　的陳沛將軍，如此地解釋這：「譬如造屋奠基，必先掃淸垃圾，試看修道築路，亦須剷平穢土，今當建國，而狡詐寡信之徒，竟故爲陣礙，重苦人民，設不去此障礙，匪惟八年抗戰之功，為之虛擲，馴日國將不國矣！」言者當語未畢　　下，聽者亦不待詞畢，即百賬償張，切齒以請日：「吾人旣以身許國，如有所需，罔不從侖，警察固願為，改業交通，亦大佳事，能從工·鑛·農·墾，另譬新天地，乃男兒快事，如轉業地方行政，予我以鄉　長工作，而得爲民前鋒，亦事之所應為者’吾人死且不懼，縱令擔土荷石，衷心亦必甘之如給。今果因建國前途，陣礙重重，雖在嚴冬冰點以下之東北，不敢辭行矣！」壯哉軍人，披育解甲，生我死我，悉如國命，敎育之功有如比，眞不負』主席宵旰憂勤，爲國儲材之厚意了！</p>
<h3>自強不息　奮鬥復興</h3>
<p>— 蔡文治</p>
<p>時光荏苒，又屆新春，去年今日，全國正在勝利的狂歡中，慶祝元旦，以為八年杭戰，本獲勝利，從此可以奮發圖强，力謀建設，廢國家於列强之林，誰知偏有一部份人挾持武力，製造內亂，以致勝利迄今，雖已年餘，而勝利成果，人民私毫未曾享到，國內叛亂，反日趨嚴重，在多數同胞，仍處於水深火熱之中，痛苦地法解除，此為　在吾人眼前之事實。</p>
<p>當前目標</p>
<p>吾人在此動盪不寗的國家內外現勢之下，來慶祝新年，內心中實不標其沉重之情，但革命事業，原非一蹴可致，革命愈是接近成功，革命的阻礙勢力，亦愈倔强，以圖困獸之鬥，祇要吾人能堅定信心，齊一步伐，以壯士斷腕的精神，淸除反革侖及假革命的勢力，肅淸一切封建殘餘，割據軍閥，和食官汚吏，土豪劣紳，則革命事業，必能成功，革命前途，一定光明。</p>
<p>語云：「一年之計在於春。」個人如此，國家亦何獨不然。値此吉日良辰，余謹提出數點，作為吾人今年努力之目標，願與全國同胞共勉之：</p>
<p>完成統一</p>
<p>第一，要想建國大業，能順利成功，非先完成國家之統一不可。如國家不統一，則社會不能安定，內亂必至頻仍，魏設事業，無從着手，而國家之統一，以軍令政令之統一，為先決條件。一國之內，不容有兩個對立的軍隊，與形成割據的地方政府，各黨派如有為國為民之誠意，應即參加政府組織，以政治方式，爭取政權，如以武力奪取政權，不但增長人民痛苦，且將招致國家的危亡。吾人為維護國家之生存，對於任何破壞統一之行為，應堅決反對，不可中其宣傳伎倆，爲其美麗名詞所迷惑。</p>
<p>完成憲政</p>
<p>第二，當前的國際潮流為民主，民主主義之理論，為民有民治民享，而三民主義之目的，即在將中國造成為民有民治民享之國家。吾人欲解救人民於倒懸，當務之急，厥為徹底實施民權主義及民生主義。當前民權主義政治建設之要務，在完成憲政，實現政治民主化，吾人要擁護政府召開國民大會，制頒憲法，與擴大政府級織，俾人民得以參政，而奠定國家長治久安之基礎。</p>
<p>促進建設</p>
<p>第三，人類生活之目的，在改善生活，滿足人羣生活之享受，欲達成此種目的，惟有走向工業化，以機器生產，美國建國，迄今不過二百年，然以其注意工業建設，現已成為世界上第一富强之國家，中國資源甚富，但不知利用，以致國敝民貧。今後完成民生主義的經濟建設，自以促進工業建設，發展機器，利用機器生產為第一要義。</p>
<p>發展科學</p>
<p>第四，自此次大戰，利用原子能結束戰爭後，吾人必須警覺已進入一新時代。中國已落伍兩個時代，一個是機器時代，一個是原子能時代。吾人欲迎頭趕上美蘇。國，無疑的要積極提倡科學化。中國過去未嘗不講科學，但因信仰不堅，行之不力，往往一曝十塞，故終鮮成效。日本之提倡科學，初不較中國為先，但因其信仰堅定，敎育普及，故科學之功用大見。中國現在工業落後，國防脆弱，其癓結在科學不發達。今後無論國家運侖如何，必需大規模普遍的提倡科學，從社會日常生活加以啓迪，使人人能格物窮理，以漸臻於利用厚生富民强國之途，必如此，吾人始能趕上今日之時代也。</p>

<h3>一個美國人看中國</h3>
<p>— 上海英文大美晚報總編輯　高爾德</p>
<p>任何善良的美國人看中國，祇有一種看法，這看法就是必需基於一種親密的友誼，而且必需對於將來寄予很高的希望。</p>
<p>我說這話並不是像許多這一類文章一樣，含有謟媚的意思。我也並不感情用事。我的信念是：中美兩國一向是隱更上很要好的朋友，所以我們不但能够互相開誠布公約相處，而且也應當這樣坦白相處。</p>
<p>對中國人看法　未敢妄自尊大</p>
<p>本文的開端是實在話，這些話能够令人愉快，是可喜的事。事實上，還有許多不大令人感到愉快的實在話，如果兩方都能坦白承認，也許能使兩國更蒙裨益。</p>
<p>雖然，我並非以一個中國人看美國的觀點來撰述本來，但是如在開端時，我能先想一想中國人對我和我的本國同胞可能發生些什麼批評，或者並非毫無價値。我覺得我們美國人在心理方面，似乎比較在物質方面更易受到批評。我們曾一再給予中國大量的物資和金錢，無論如何遠較我們得自中國者為多—無論是從贈與，或者是從中國人所常常指摘外國的所謂經濟侵略。中國抗日戰爭的勝利，我們實際上帮助很多，雖然有許多中國人批評我們帮助得太遲緩。但是，如說我們的態度有時稍欠謙遜，倒也許在所不免。我們美國人作客異邦，也許在行動上並不是每個人都能處處謹愼。無疑的，有時我們的態度一定會被別人視為倨傲，實際上我們絕非故意要顯得如此，而是別人看得這樣。我們整個民族，的確有一些躁急和不能忍耐的傾向。如果事情開端得不大順利，我們往往就會變得憤怒或者沮喪，常此中國在戰後復興頗為遲滯的時候，這一點也許是很重要的。</p>
<p>這些話決不能包括中國人對美國人所有批評的全部，但是，我希望至少我已說明了我已顧到了這層，也說明了我並未用妄自尊大的眼光來看中國人。我自一九二四年首决到達了那時的北京，以後大多數時間都在中國，住了這許多年以後，我很有機會看出，有很多地方是要引起我自己和我們美國人批評的，而同時却看到了中國人倒常常自得其樂，頗感滿意。一個普通的中國人享受比一個通美國人少得多，但是偏會得享福。</p>
<p>雖富於創造性　卻大善辦事業</p>
<p>要我說一點美國人眼光中的中國，我就不能不承認：看到了中國人那種心滿意足的樣子，有時我是要忍不住的。如果中國人多感到一些不滿，也許建立一個更好的中國倒會快一些。有些事情明明可謀改善，他們就肯加以接受接受得太容易了。照我看來，中國要變成近代化，這是亟應大事改變的若干事項之一。</p>
<p>為甚麼中國人在發明事物的時候，常能如此的富於創造性，而就不能推行那些很好的事業？這是一個使我始終不能解答的問題。許多很好的開端，都是中國人的功績，而後來都不能維續原來的成就。譬如說，以印刷術為例。中國知印刷術最早，但是這一種極重要的事業，就未能供全中國人民利用，而祇使文化比較高的少數人士蒙其利益。中國的書籍，雜誌，報紙，和別的國家相較，總覺得還是流通欠廣。有人吿訴我們，說有許多中國人窮得讀不起書，就從這一件事情可知印刷術尙未充分加以利用。印刷術是傳播知識的工具，它將來必能帮助中國的富盛。中國這幾百年來早就應當能够做到這地步，可是中國竟坐令這很有用的發明變得太專門化，終至沒落了。</p>
<p>一個最大弱點　不能用人惟才</p>
<p>中國早就有開科取士之制，實在是最早的文官制度。但是這制度也總於沒落，成為毫無用處。照一個美國人看起來，中國無論在政務上或是私人經營上，最大的弱點之一就是好引親友，不能用人惟才。現在就應常回到這個中國自己以前會領導過的制度。</p>
<p>中國主要是一個濃業國家，農夫最多，而農夫是注重實際的。中國人在歷史上一向是一個汪重實際的民族，其原因在此。但是，我覺得在目前新的環境之中，似乎他們有點不甚注重實際的傾向，尤其以工業界為甚。以前，上海的工人常常受到壓迫，因為有許多雇主不明白如果工人的工作時間較短，膳食較好，工資較高，結果能使工作的效率增高，而雇主自己也就可以獲利更豐。現在，我們覺得正有相反的趨勢。工人們動輒向資方提出資方所事實上不能負担的要求，而任何辨白，祇要工人們以為違反了他們的利益，他們就總是一概置之不理。我是一個外國人，我就聽見過有幾家洋商工廠裏，工人們向外國要求極高的工資，他們說如果雇主們主不出工資，那麼就應當把外國人送幾個回去。這種事情就是毫不顧到實際，人家到外國來做生意，目的當然不是送錢給外國。傳敎士是來做好事的，情形與此不同，也許有許多中國人的心理有些攪胡塗了。比較妥當的辦法，還是把在中國的外國商人和在外國的中國商人比較一下。他們出門，主要的用意無非是想好好的做筆生意啊！</p>
<p>走那一條路綫　現在正應抉擇</p>
<p>現在，我要提到現在我心頭最關切的一個問題了。這就是；中國還是準備走嚴格的國家主義的路綫呢，還是想採取比較傾向國際主義的態度？如果是「中國者，中國人之中國」的想法，那麼將來恐怕不能期望別國會給與很大的帮助。聯合國善後救濟總署即將結束，大多數捐贈物資的國家，似乎對道决實騐印象欠佳，而這許多國家之中，美國是居於領袖地位的。許多美國人和其他人士都覺得以後再要帮助像中國這種國家，最好的辦法還是要把這種帮助當作一種生意來做，而不必繼續專門把東西送人。所以中國現在應當抉擇，她不能又採取國家主義的立場，而同時又想接受她復興時所需要的物資。</p>
<p>訂立公平條約　兩國同蒙其利</p>
<p>如果中國還要別的國家的帮助，那麼這些別的國家要求獲得若干利益，是在意料之中的。我並不是說，他們一定要什麼使中國主權會蒙受任何損害的特權。事實上並無這樣發展的跡象。許多中國人對中美商的的態度，實在使美國人吃了一驚。這是一個傳統而保守的條約，用意在訂定若干公平的條文，俾中美通商時有所遵循，務求兩國均蒙其利。許多美國人都以爲在開始的時候，中國從此的所得的利益，實在比美國為多，因為美國資源豐富，在戰時受到的損失又比較少一點。但是，有幾家中國報紙就表示懷疑，說訂這個商約的用意是美國對華的一種侵略。但是這種侵略怎麼會得成功，却從來沒有人解釋過。美國在這幾年中是「給」甚於「取」，而且許多人都以為如果要中國站得穩，美國還得大大的捐出一點資財出來。但是看到了中國人中還有人抱這種懷疑的心理，實在令人感覺痛苦，因為，中國人這種心理，正可以促使美國或其他別的國家退出中國，而把自己的財富另想用途。</p>
<p>保持親善互信　控制貿易趨向</p>
<p>在一個美國人的立塲，我不願讓別人覺得我太敏感，我也不怕別人把美國的商業計劃，付之最詳備的考騐，看看是好是壞。我祇希望中美二國，能够保持過去親善的互信，因為這稱普通的心理上的問題，與控制將來貿易上的趨向，可能有相當大的影響。　我希望中國不但能表示相信美國，而且，我還希望中國能看出，她實在需要提供出特殊優惠，能使美國資金和技術樂於到中國來。目前的中國，並不是令人樂於投資之地。虧本的機會很多，這是明明白白的事實。中國人自己也很明白這一點，因為他們自己做起交易來，在放一筆有些風險的款子時，他們通常都先要一筆大大的利息。相彷的，如果呌外國到中國來投資，外國當然也總期望得到比在投資的安全較有保陣的地方較好的利潤。但是，現在我們就找不到能使美國人到中國來冒這種風險的誘導力。不但他們看有不到什麼賺錢的機會，而且事實上中國現在的法律還不准他們把賺來的錢匯回美國。他們受到許多中國政府法令的拘束，如關於得到外匯，進口權，和其他許多許多項目，而這些法規正在日見增多。所以，在這種情形之下，我們幾乎看不到有什麼新的美國或別國的企業願到中國來冒險，有些人在續辦戰前開設的公司，但他們都覺得維特頗不容易。</p>
<p>大家一起合作　繁復興有望</p>
<p>所以，依一個美國人對中國的看法，我祇覺得除了這幾年來所認識的許多私人的朋友之外，實在是相常孤單的。而我這些中國友人也當在遭受着美國人和別的外國人的企業相似的厄運。他們常常要和政府的企業競爭，也常常受到種種法規的束縛。他們為通貨膨脹所苦。我非常同情他們，我並不要建議什麼置美國人在華利益於中國人之上的改革。當前的局面是我們大家都芝受影喘息緊急關頭。我祇建議：在處理中國的各項問題時，中國人應當一方面利用外國人已有的經騐，而把這些經騐與自己所有的很好的各掛才能配合運用。譬如說，我們已在美國發現了法規太多，徒足以阻礙商業。近來美國非常缺乏肉類，有人就建議杜魯門總統控制全國性畜塲，把私人所有的性畜予以沒收。他並未採納這個建議，反而倒把一切的配給限物一筆勾銷。當然這樣做漢有使物價上漲的不良後果，但至少市面上出現了一些肉類，而且肉業也就漸漸興吒起來。我想中國人也是管制愈少，反應愈好的。如果有人能鼓勵美國人到中國來，而且能使他們來到中國之後能够覺得是為人家所歡迎着，我想他們就能找到許多願意和他們一起工作的中國人。祇要大家能够合作，中國的商業就可以重又椎動。祇有在商業能够迅速進行之後，恢復繁榮才有希望。中國人是和美國人一樣的，祗有恢復了繁榮才能享受到人生的種種快樂。</p>

<h3>談笑劇</h3>
<p>— 管玉</p>
<p>自「昇官圖」演出後，笑劇就被繼續不斷地搬上了舞台。據說是話劇的過渡時期，用笑劇來維持這危機的。但是，「昇官圖」之所以能賣座，並不完全因爲是笑劇的緣故，而是爲了它的內容與觀衆的生活有密切關係，也正是說出了觀衆心中所要說的話，因而造成了它空前的賣座紀錄。</p>
<p>抗戰八年雖然勝利，條火却還是遍地；人們的心理上，誰都有一層陰影。因此「笑」就成了精神上所需要的了。但是無意義的「笑」，並不能袪除人們心理上的陰暗，只有代人們說出心中憂鬱和苦悶的。「笑」，才是人們所需要的。</p>
<p>正在上演的「結婚進行曲」和「裙帶風」就是兩個笑劇。</p>
<p>「結婚進行曲」</p>
<p>這是描寫未結婚的單身女子找不到房子，結了婚的又找不到職業，雖然作者在最後一幕中是用悲劇的形式來作結尾，但他並沒有離開這劇的主題。</p>
<p>黃瑛是一個入世未深的女孩子，對自己的前途充滿了希望，她有光明的理想和豐富的幻想，但現實的社會到處給她失望和碰壁。這不是黃瑛的錯誤，而是社會中的怪現象在阻止她，欺騙她，不讓她走上她自己所希望的道路。</p>
<p>有很多智識家庭婦女在學校時代，都有着遠大的計劃，但在結婚後，生了孩子，這些計劃都化爲烏有，她們直覺地把破壞計劃的責任放在結婚上，自從看了這「結婚進行曲」以後，她們會看出這責任不在結婚，而在「社會問題」。</p>
<p>「裙帶風」</p>
<p>作者以諷刺的筆觸，無情地畫出這一幅醜惡的圖畫，告訴了無數失業的智識靑年失業的原因。他寫官僚們利用女太太們的裙帶關係，做昇官發財的階梯；也寫出了利用裙帶關係做謀事和晋級的手段。爲了這帮無恥的官僚們任用裙帶上的關係人，才使有才能的專門人材無法去實現自已的志願。</p>
<p>這里附帶地寫出了官僚們的昏瞆：剛有一個槪念，就決定行動。所以弄出很多笑話來。</p>
<p>這劇中的演員都演得好，惟演陳白琪的女演員，時常忍不住地笑，破壞劇中情緒不少。</p>
<h3>論天蟾的失策</h3>
<p>— 馮長</p>
<p>天蟾舞台程譚之局下來以後，接着即以高盛麟挑大樑；袁世海，楊菊蘋輔之，業已於日內登台。</p>
<p>其實這一决的計劃，在總綱上說是聰明的，梅蘭芳在「中國」賣二萬，麒麟童在「黃金」售一萬二，高盛麟只賣六千比麒麟童還要多劉折，天蟾的座位多，薄利多賣，自能戰勝麒麟童，也不致敗於梅蘭芳。</p>
<p>但是他們在細則上是失策了，因爲他們放棄了閻世善，而換用了楊菊蘋，我們且慢談閻世善的好處，且談楊菊蘋的不當。</p>
<p>第一，楊菊蘋風騷旣欠勁，嫵媚又不足。論她的號召力，她在海派戲中早已失去了這一點，何况再論她的京朝戲？她會「紡棉花」，也會「大劈棺」，但始終不曾以此成「名」在號召方面她更難以爲力了。同時她是郭玉崑之妻「看」客對她更沒有多大胃口，除非天蟾每天晚塲讓她在台上跳一决「五脫舞」（比吳筱蘭多一脫），也許還可以拉幾十個觀衆。但是這又是絕對不可能的事情。</p>
<p>第二，楊菊蘋的唱，其根底功夫等等眞正平劇藝術的形容詞，我想還是不用爲妙。最簡單的一句話，在這一點上楊菊蘋是無論如何根不上現在天蟾的班底魏蓮芳的。</p>
<p>第三，天蟾請楊菊蘋的原因，也許有一條是爲高盛麟配戲，她有什麼可以配呢？最普通的不外是「翠屏山」和「武松潘金運」。試問就這兩齣戲來說，在今日的上海，還是高盛麟來唱能有强大的號召力？還是楊菊蘋來唱能有强大的召號力？還是高楊兩位合起來唱能有强大的號召力？這三個回答自然都是「不是」。只要看第一晚打泡戲便成，高楊的「武松與潘金運」祇能唱在壓台，而且後面還補上一齣「連環套。」由此可知「武松與潘金運」在高盛麟的號召力上（我這裹並不談他的藝術）最多是一齣「贈品戲」或「附屬戲」而已，旣是如此，沒有號召力的戲，在營業上說省些錢得了　在藝術上也該講究搭配，則以該用魏蓮芳已經足够，又何</p>
<p>必請敎於楊菊蘋呢？</p>
<p>從上三點，楊菊蘋似乎是不該聘請的，我們現在再談閻世善的好處。</p>
<p>第一，他有最好的武旦根底，（南北第一武且）就藝術說，應該請。</p>
<p>第二，他在天蟾對三層樓及後排的觀衆有絕對把握的號召力。天蟾舞台三層樓及後排的座位又多，又寬。假使天蟾售價便宜，對前排觀衆也有相當的號召力。所以說如果能好好利用閻世善，天蟾門口一定有很多人爲着要看閻世着而買票。</p>
<p>第三，他的戲如列在壓軸，他一定肯賣力；愈賣力，不論前排後排愈是有人看，衹有高袁同台時，他沒有列在壓軸的機會，其他生旦來了，他又論爲班世超的位子，那就失去地的效力了。所以該聰明地利用閻世善。</p>
<p>還看逢到「大泗州城」，「楊排風」等戲，他也有特別號召力，應把他放在大軸，高盛麟配猢猻與楊六郞：角兒捧角兒該是更聰明的辦法。而且要閻世善更有號召力，要閻世善的戲更賣錢也祇有高袁合作的時候，因爲在今天的高盛麟，他是肯配的。過幾天他紅了也許不肯了。凡是名作，絕作，該用列大軸的方式來捧他，纔能露出該戲的最藝術。</p>
<p>以前李萬春，毛世來同台，曾採用過這個法子。李在毛世來的拿手戲「大英節烈」中配皇甫剛，衹有得到一體的好評，沒有一個人說李萬春跌了身價。</p>
<p>自然高盛麟也是肯配，而且也是該配的，只要閻世善有眞藝術。</p>
<h3>找尋人物性格</h3>
<p>— 高衡</p>
<p>典型的創造；所謂典型，就是在社會上由於特定的經濟條件，職業生活……的相同而聚集在一起的一羣人物，例如：農人羣、工人羣、商人羣……每一個羣裹因爲他們職業、生活、習慣……的相同，因此在說話、動作、甚至於皮膚、衣著……都有共同之點，這些都是代表着他們一羣的特點，這些特點是給作者們最好的材料，這時候創造成的胚胎就是「典型」的。</p>
<p>個性的創造：每一角色除了他自己階層所共有的特　之外，由他身世、年齡、强弱、性情……等的不同，因此就產生着他獨有的動作、語言、性情，所以一個作者除了在羣中創造典型外，必須向他自己角色獨有的深處掘發。</p>
<p>外形的創造：人類有着繁多的類型，高矮、胖瘦、兇善、俊醜，……而在雨慶的態度上，動作的習慣更是各　有殊，強盜有強盜的相貌，小偸有小偷的舉止，僞君子有為君子的態度，艷婦有艷婦的妖嬈，淑女有淑女的恬靜，因此，你想使你的角色給讀者以深刻印象，你也得注意你角色外形的創造。</p>
<p>內心的創造：一個作者光是　注在角色的外形上還是不夠，儘必須更進一步注意她生命的內裏，一個人物的外形的舉止言談一定有着分了　內心的思想情緒，作着根擾，一個憂鬰的　婦和一個愉快的富商在內心的情緒上根本會一樣；同樣兩個農人，也同樣是瘦瘦的，然而他們經過的事變各有不同，因此在內心上的表現，決不相像，光有外形的人物只是有軀殻，有了內心纔算有了雪魂。</p>
<h3>關於崑曲</h3>
<p>— 向培良</p>
<p>（編者按）；這是向培良先生來的信，對本刊去年十二月十五日玄廬先生的「崑曲盛衰觀」一文有所商榷。編者把信中與該文有關之一節刊登，作爲學術研討。</p>
<p>玄廬先生的「崑曲盛衰觀」一文，因篇幅關係會被編者删去一部份，如：向培良先生舉出之第五點，玄廬先生曾在「數幕」之後，加括弧說明，即「數曲」等字，被編者删去，深致歉意！我於此道頗欠博涉，但可以指出玄廬先生的文字幾乎每節都有錯誤。</p>
<p>一，楚詞與漢魏樂府實有大距離。所謂楚歌，並不列入楚詞中，西漢初期樂府如房中歌，郊祀，鐃歌等與四言詩絕無淵源，如何籠統說：一再變而爲漢魏樂府？」</p>
<p>二，「宋詞演變爲元曲」不知有何根據。曲如鼓子詞，轉踏，儷令等早在北宋初年就有了。</p>
<p>三，參軍黃鵠戲，文獻極多，如何可說：「內容如何，已無從考證？」</p>
<p>四，曲有劇曲，散曲，散曲並非代言體，元明作者極盛，如何可以說：「曲爲代言體，有唱詞，有道白？」唱詞爲曲，道白並非曲也。</p>
<p>五，「每一劇本分爲數幕」不知爲中國何種戲劇（話劇例外）。</p>
<p>六，「今所傳之崑曲，已非元曲之歸」，不知是說什麼。崑曲的崑字，指一種唱腔，非指戲劇體裁，故根本不能與元曲對舉</p>
<p>七，「明人雖欲復古，而不能脫離其窠臼。於是曲有南北之分」。不知南曲實早於北曲。南宋永嘉雜劇又稱戲文，發展在元曲之前；爲何到明人裁有「南北之分」。就是玄廬先生所認爲開其先河的琵琶記，寫作時也在元未亡以前。</p>
<p>八，「雜劇謂之北曲，其體製多仿元人遺作」。不知道「元人遺作」不稱爲雜劇，還稱作什麼？</p>
<p>九，「傳奇謂之南曲，高則誠琵琶記開其先河，初明荊劉拜殺，繼之而作」。這幾句話又犯了兩大錯誤。南曲（戲文）存目極多。南宋作品亦有小孫屠等三種傳世。荊劉拜殺四種，除出閨記（拜月亭）外都在琵琶記之前，即都在明建國以前。</p>
<p>好了，已經寫到九條，不必再往下寫了，我國以九爲數之極，所以不必寫到十條；但所記還不到原文三分之一！</p>
<h3>「裙帶風」一主角：馮喆</h3>
<h3>光的性質</h3>
<p>— 文泉</p>
<p>兩千餘年前，亞里斯多德解釋光的性質謂：發光體為運動之起點，於其四週「媒質」中生起波動，漸傳漸遠，乃達於人目。牛頓初亦不致信，西紀千六百七十八年荷蘭人海鑑斯亦重提此說。及後英人耶恩法人佛蘭奈爾均詳爲推闡，解釋一切光象，始有今之定論。</p>
<p>光之發生，或由電化，最主要普通之原因，則爲體高熱而俱起，熱本爲物質之急速振動。此動波及四周媒質，而成輻射波紋。如石之投水，漣漪遽起。運動益急，發熱愈高，動浪愈短，人目乃見其光，由橙而黃，以至純白。依彼光波長短，而異色覺。</p>
<p>通常光傳至第二處媒質境面時，必反射其一部，是爲光之反射，如受光面極平滑而若鏡若水，測反射亦極有規則。即投射角多大，反射角亦多大。若受光面稍不平滑，反射方向則無規定矣。因有此亂反射之作用，吾人生活上乃能籌得如許便利。如室內雖無日光射入，而由靑空反射之，遊塵又反射之，一切物面又錯綜反射之，仍能保持適當明度，各物亦均非黑影，而賴此形體畢露。</p>
<p>物面反射，其投射角愈大，反射量愈强。水面射光成埀直時，反射光千分之十八；成三十度時，猶不過千分之十九；至八十度而反射千分之三百三十三，九十度則反射千分之七百二十一。吾人臨海，見近處蒼碧，遠則茫然；又河中樹影，近晰遠糊，皆屬比理。</p>
<p>光綫遠過第二媒質時，其方向必略有轉折，是爲光之屈折。有此屈折之物理，吾人遂用三稜鏡而分散白光，得赤橙黃錄靑紫之彩色光帶。使吾人得知以上諸色素與紅綠靑之三原色。朝露映日發爲奇彩，雨過天靑又有虹霓，乃至飛沫流波成異色之迷，便依茲打破。原來都是空中水沫分光的作用。</p>
<p>除分光作用外，光亦能因空間微粒分子而分離，而變幻成各種色光。如滴牛乳於水，攪和便混，再承以光，則見水面微帶靑色，杯底則略帶橙黃。此理即爲光波中較長之赤橙黃色，對於較小之微粒無所衝突，安然而過，較短之靑紫，則被阻折回。又如炊烟襯以村舍樹木，則黝然以靑。托太空則噯然成黃。此亦爲烟中炭素微粒之分光作用。同理，夜氣混濁，或有陰霧，遠見燈光爲赤色，漸近則爲橙色，愈近則爲黃色。故遠景輒難窺得純色，而爲微粒分折所冲淡。美國舞　與彩色電影中，則常噴微粒於色燈下，換取彩色雲霧之幻感。而我國舞臺上所能發現者，唯極不衛生之灰塵而已。</p>
<h3>羅斯福</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>誰扮演這位大政治家</p>
<p>美國已故總統羅斯福，他一生盡瘁於謀世界之和平，在世界的歷史上他的事蹟當然是永遠不朽的。美國好萊塢各公司早有將道位世界偉人搬上銀幕的計劃，而所以遲遲未實現的原因，一方面係由於不可草草從事；另一面是因爲不容易找到一個適當並勝任的演員來扮演這個銀幕上的「羅斯福」，據說最初選的是里昂巴里摩亞；後來因羅斯福夫人的堅決反對作罷，她所持的不贊成理由是說她丈夫生飾最後一次大總統選舉時，里昂巴里摩亞是站在反對黨方面的。好萊塢米高梅公司當局最後選取了一位僑居紐約的英國演員來担任，茄茀雷銻爾（Todfrey　Tearle），無論在外表上，姿態上，都很像羅斯福，由他來飾演據各界的輿論認爲是一定可以滿意的，羅斯福夫人亦不反對；但她要求電影公司當局注意銀幕上的「羅斯福」不能在正面拍，而以四分之三斜度拍出爲最佳，公司方面接受她的意見。最後是這部偉大的傳記片現已定名爲（The　Begiming</p>
<p>＆　the　End），羅斯福氏雖已死，但他精神不死，他的一番事業又足爲後世代代景仰，所以道個定名亦是選得很好的！</p>
<h3>新片漫談</h3>
<p>— 馬博良</p>
<p>「海盜」</p>
<p>却爾斯勞頓綽綽有餘的演技</p>
<p>是那串相同的陰影籠罩了他，殘忍，狠毒，刻薄，刁惡，陰險，偽善，這個海盜頭兒與共他海盜頭兒大同小異。只有一點迥異：他要做一個貴族，一個紳士，處處企圖擺脫他表面的粗野，絕無一自由萬歲」中潘卓維拉的眞率魯莽和在放。所以他不是英雄，於是一個龐大的黑影掠過他的生命，傑特船長完了。這稱角色相當普遍，不比潘卓維拉約有血有肉。。這裹沒有一點人間的燈火，如果我們把它列爲新年戲目的最佳者，那還是爲了我們童年時代潛藏的冒險的好奇心。導演追隨編劇的意旨，未曾利用高潮，只是順决序的一幕一塲的介紹下去，總算整整有條，最觸目的是那本黑籍簿，名字劃了一個又一個，可惜導演未加一個花頭，讓別人把傑特之名加上然後劃掉，否則就更有力了。</p>
<p>傑特一角個性之特別，在却爾斯勞頓演來眞是易如反掌，但是太從容了，刻劃便無峻奇的地方，稱職而已。侖道夫史谷脫的梅西和白蓓蘭勃立登的安妮，純然是陪襯者一流，點綴點綴，侖道夫依然保守定型，白蓓蘭亦不及「貞女恨」中的修進女。倒是其他幾個配角甚佳，萊琪諾奧溫的「紳士的紳士」，飾海盜頭兒普費的長臉人，飾海盜頭羅倫蕭的，都有聲有色。</p>

<p>嬌變嫵媚一型的少女明星至今仍受歡迎，可是在初中時代歡喜狄安娜寶萍的人，如今開始偏愛新典的瓊麗絲運，狄安娜巴里摩亞和杜娜李德，狄安娜寳萍的火花漸漸熄了，我們如今對於她已失去過往的期望，不再向她的發胖的臉做夢。「彩鳳奪鷲」是喜劇作風，狄安娜尚有可觀，到「偵探小姐」「聖誕節」已經平庸無奇。「彩鳳淸歌」的五彩也拯救不了，她的臉不宜彩色，還是黑白片裏來得婉變可愛。導演勞勃李恩，倒底是小輩，不能運用開末拉，介紹故事程序平板之至，編劇處理題材只有一點脫俗，就是浴堂洗罷川來候隔室唱歌女郞，誤認老婦，將故事轉了一個彎。裘羅美基思的作曲尚屬動聽，因此狄安娜在馬車上歌唱而來，輕快自如，男主角勞勃潘琪平平，亞金泰米洛夫這一對寳貨，雖是小丑，尚不討厭。</p>
<p>我就喜歡它一個塲面，正如我愛「合家歡」這張歌舞片一樣。那是花樹鬰戊，太陽來到山野上遊戲的時候，狄安娜穿了白衫才，驚於明媚的自然風景，不禁引吭高歌，我們到了山明水秀的境界，常有放歌的胸懷，狄安娜的歌唱正是我們的心聲。其次，在溪邊一曲戀歌，狄安娜的臉上確有情愛的光澤，是她過去光榮僅存的一朶蓓蕾，是靑春在美麗地閃爍。</p>
<p>雙鳳緣</p>
<p>影幕缺了五彩，瑪麗蒙丹减色。</p>
<p>黑色的舞扇半遮半掩，黑色的舞衫飄飄拂拂，黑色的星眼朦朧開啓，瑪麗蒙丹活了一點，不像童話世界裏的公主那樣是個偶像，可是沒有五彩，瑪麗便覺减色，太長的臉，沒有誘惑力的新裝，我們代瑪麗蒙丹吊滯的眼波惋惜，葉鳳黛卡珞眞的勝利了，「雙鳳綠」較之「莎樂美」有數倍的簡陋，零零落落，稀稀疏疏，偵探片而不緊張，神秘，沒有氣氛，沒有高潮，只有魯意亞白莉登强拖警佐電梯直墮同歸於盡一塲，較爲有力。比之「魔網擒王」，「雙鳳緣」眞差，這怪不了瑪麗蒙丹，導演編劇監製不能辭過，譬如薩菩一角，根本就是多餘而且討厭！</p>
<p>禁宮迷魂</p>
<p>「平地靑雲」拉開阿拉伯禁宮的黑幕，燕瘦環肥，鶯鶯燕燕，眞是美不勝收，瑪琳黛德麗的一堪玄腿舞，誘人至深，其次再說「一千〇一夜」，倒也不少後宮佳麗，爭妍鬥艷，「禁宮迷魂」裹就沒有這些迷魂塲面，旣無麗者，亦無悅耳歌舞，詹姆陶西名不虛傳，但也無能爲力，瑪琳麥絲惠兒徒具美色而已。丟開這些，亞博考斯坦羅的噱頭尚多，單談令人捧腹一點，雖然不及「眞假姑母」，倒也將就得過，如此而已。好萊　的滑稽片正到岔路，不知何處去。</p>

<h3>草書草說</h3>
<p>— 張枕綠</p>
<p>『字如蚯蚓當龍蛇，競說天師是本家。我亦點金無別術，墨塗　換白花花。』這是往年自題潤例前的小詩，爲有同文戲稱我書爲張天師畫符者。的確，草書連綴寫來，形同符錄，其不易使大家認識，尤難普遍應用是事實。一般人所寫的草字，頗多是草草不恭，各自草其草罷了。</p>
<p>舉一個例：賢如林語堂先生，曾刊我（署名張皇）的「草畫草說」在他編的「人間世」上，所有題目，目錄，及各報廣吿，全都蛻變爲「草書學說」了。明明是雜文，一變其面目爲道貌岸然的學說，大概是我第二個寫得草些的「草」字被誤認了。</p>
<p>草書愛好者如我，也希望草書大衆化。可是大家應用的草書，雜以破體，小寫，簡筆，甚至帳簿體的寫法居多。「蝦仁蛋炒飯」的正規草书，在菜館帳席忙不開交的筆下，遠不如「蚱仁旦反」之省便，並爲食客所熟識，當票上的花色名目習慣寫草了些，一般人就對之瞠目不知所云。敎育部一度推行標準簡體字，尙即收回成命。今賢提倡草書爲爭取時間，我絕對表示祟敬，測其爲上乘說法而已。</p>
<p>在藝術觀点上，書法原是我國特有的藝術，草書允佔一切書法之勝。草書旣與畫理更相通，美術條件也格外完備。若欠藝術大才與學養功力，那能寫成一幅唯美的草書作品？所以草書是藝人之事，儘可終身以之。我們先要提倡的，是怎樣使大家對草書增加興趣。</p>
<p>前人說過：「楷書如蹲，行書如行，草書如奔。」寫草書宜疾速如奔是不錯的，但只指示了一部份。一字之草法有多樣，須因地以制宜，字與字間大小疎密應配合，行與行間相侵相讓費斟酌，非儘奔可了。况且草書的姿態，或放浪如江濤，而或堅定如山岳，或流轉如游絲蕩漾，又或古拙如苔石斑爛，固意到筆隨，略無疑滯，而紆廻頓挫，骨力求周，誠非一奔所能盡。想到張旭觀舞劍器而草書長進，文與可見蛇鬥而悟草理，都與奔無關。我以爲不如說：「楷書如坐，行書如步，草書如舞。』</p>
<p>東坡酒後作草，覺有酒氣拂拂自十指間出。懷素自叙說：醉來信手兩三行，醒後却收書不得。神來之筆大都產生於烟士披里純，這是文人藝人的常事，不獨草書家爲然。</p>
<p>草書名家雖不世出，然取前人規範，展自己機抒，應得今人勝古人，爲什麼晚近草書人材這麼的寥落？而東瀛人士反多研習講求，他們搜印我國的書畫碑帖極廣徵博採之能事，大有草風東漸之勢。這麼看來，我們姑綏奢求特出的草書家，而以提高一般同胞的智識水準尤為急務。</p>
<h3>湖上　—旅滇小記之三—</h3>
<p>— 林詠泉</p>
<p>秋天了。</p>
<p>平漫的稻穀，都因爲牠們　富的果實的担負而低下頭。褪成殘黃色的衣裳，也零亂地任秋風撕撕扯扯，有的更相依而臥着。一些靑春地葱龍煥發的陳夢；幼小時秧田中鳴奏着淙淙的雨滴聲，以及翩翩點點的蜻蜓徘徊顧盼的情景，都只有在道種垂老的偃息中去回憶。</p>
<p>坐鎭在三脾坊的石獅子，如今却移在昆湖小學的門首。當年雄視着街衢的行人，也好像為那一時一兩個自稱爲「王」的官史助威的無生物，如今也只好屈蹲在低低的門首，任那些初識之無的孩子們所撫玩與嘲弄了。時代的變遷如比，思想的變遷是否亦將如此？我們不知這此後還有想跨獅爲王的孩子嗎？</p>
<p>到大觀樓門前時，仍是靜靜地，這怕因爲不是假日，所以幾乎不見遊人，有的使是一兩對相的談情的伴侶，他們是不願與別人打照而而特別選擇一所僻靜的地方，竊竊私語着，以及準備另一些可能的發展。也還有急急忙忙乘着一隻小船，做着水上的幻夢，尋覓着另一稱溫情的靑年男女。唐繼堯乘馬的銅像；棋門的長聯；動物園的虎豹與孔雀，猿猴與黑熊；以及所有的佈置與建築，所有的花花草草，是不被他們所注意的。</p>
<p>接近樓邊的草海，常為遊人的目的地，而也多半因爲到那兒可以乘船，爲了在這茫茫的海中—滇人呼滇池爲海—去體味那「放洋」，那「乘風波浪」的况味。十幾隻小蓬船，停在未經特殊建築的小碼頭的柳蔭下，在靜靜地鵠候着顧客，他們的主人更在湖邊的狹路上，兜攬着生意。寂寞的湖邊，便時常被他們爭議價　　喳　　的聲音所攪破。</p>
<p>到湖上了，平靜的湖水，被閒情地不經意的小風吹起了紋縐。也因爲船的推進，總是有兩股微捲的髮綹在船底兩側分開來。有時風吹得大起來，所有的水面，都在激情地笑着。如嬉戲的兒童羣，攀扶着，擁抱着；砌成墻，砌成一道長長的堤埂。但隨之就傾塌，陷成一個鍋形的圓底，繁雜的笑聲，有着暫時的喘息。但後來者的膀臂，又繼續不斷地撲上來，唏唏哈哈的笑聲，便似永無終止。</p>
<p>這些船，這些時常扯起一頁小襟帆的木片，總是無聲無息地在這面湖上飄蕩着，而更召來那些隨時都在洗浴着牠們底白羽的白鷗。時而迴舞在湖底上空；時而與明潔地湖底面頰相吻噙。寂寞的湖水，寂寞的小船，與寂寞的遠山，寂寞地湖岸的村落；都彷彿因爲牠這稱適意的遊戲，而現着愉悅與活潑，幸福與安寗了。</p>
<p>湖水隨季節而漲落；湖岸與遠山隨季節而凋謝與繁榮，蕭條與熟鬧。而寂寞地終古如斯的船，却永恒地停泊在湖邊，飄蕩在湖上。縱然他們也有着不節單的生殖與死亡，新製與破廢，但在我們這些遊湖的瞬息而過的人，却不能想到這些</p>
<p>漸黃昏了，湖上的晚風慾急。從遠方，隱隱的歸帆，齊飄向樓邊，集向那濛濛地高樹長竹的灣岸。寂靜的湖邊，燃起星星漁火。</p>
<h3>指畫家滕白也</h3>
<p>— 許士騏</p>
<p>遠在十幾年前，我庽居南京的時候，藝苑同志，曾組織了一個書畫會，定名蕙社，每週叙談二次，研討觀摩，極饒興趣。社中諸友，均一時俊彥。當時滕白也兄，以多才多藝，善作指頭書畫，馳譽藝林。抗戰軍興，國府西遷，同人星散，白也遠走桂林，飽覽西南山水，雖艱苦備嘗，其識愈宏，其藝愈精，蓋得於大自然之助者多矣，勝利後，重晤陪都，刧後餘生，恍同隔世，乃面的相見海上。</p>
<p>白也生長江南，幼有神童之譽，極富藝術天才，對於造形美術，如彫塑，繪畫，建築，均所擅長，而於指畫允有造詣，山永翎毛，一揮而就，一日能畫成一二十幅，其神速如此。昔年留學美洲，攻讀哈佛大學，展覽作品，極博盛譽，歸國後，執敎鞭於北平燕京大學，主講中國美術史。</p>
<p>白也除工繪事外，允精雕　，出品曾陳列歷屆全國美展，爲識者所欽。民國廿六年春，首都倡議建立國父中山先生銅像，於新街口廣塲，徵集全國作家圖案及塑像模型，由黨國先進，以不記名投票推舉，白也得膺首選。在積極籌畫中，不幸蘆溝橋戰爭爆發，瀰漫全國，因此停頓，現値抗戰勝利，希望能舊事重提，實現其計劃，面完成工作，在首都留一永久之紀念品。</p>
<p>此次展覽，近作指畫百餘幅，如牡丹之富麗，竹石之秀挺，雲峯飛瀑之幽奇，葡萄紫籐之蒼勁，妍麗，鱗潛羽翔，活色生香，極富自然的生命，而開創國畫上另一風格，彌足珍視。淸畫家高其佩，字且園，遼陽人，工詩，善指頭畫，人物，花木，魚龍，鳥獸，撥指揮灑，均盡其妙。白也雖受其影響，實有靑勝於藍之譽。鑒賞家見之，當信吾言之不虛。</p>
<h3>瀟湘圖</h3>
<p>— 徐邦達</p>
<p>徐君邦達，工詩擅畫，書法亦娟秀絕倫，庋藏甚富，婆娑觀摩，師古不泥，自發天機。此决徇同好之請，舉行個展一星期。上圖爲出品之一，筆墨瀟洒，韵味醇厚，意境尤爲深邃淸新，蒼茫媚嫵。（翀鵬）</p>
<h3>讀侯湘畫記</h3>
<p>— 楊愷齡</p>
<p>人生不過數十寒暑，欲延長其生命，非有他力爲之助，則與草木同腐而已。傳世之工具，或藉功業，或藉著述，或藉瑰奇特別之行爲。此所以負才藝之士，發憤為學，不計名之傳與吾，但蘄行能之卓絕於時，殫精竭慮，苦其心志，以有生之光陰，逐無涯之學術，茹茶之苦，甘之如飴。</p>
<p>侯先生湘，字嘩華，無錫東里人。其家自明初企竹翁始以文學政事著於時，嗣後科第仕宦之盛，歷十四世而不斬。先生之若祖若父，均工詩善畫，涵濡家學，旣遠且深。就傳之年，即寢饋經史詞章之學；所作駢偶之文，已驚其長老。稍長投筆從戎，往來於燕齊吳越之墟，顧性傲岸，不能詭隨取容，乃徒步歸鄕里，發書誦讀，恒終夜不息，二十歲以後，始從其鄕丁雲軒先生學繪事，由林良周之冕惲南田蔣南沙而叩華新羅之藩。故筆致古豔，取景深穩，碩彥如裘可桴吳稚暉諸先生皆期許之，茲者吳稚暉丁福保兩先生擇其作品都五十餘幀，假呂班路蒲柏路日雲林書畫社公開展覽七天。凡花鳥蟲魚之作二十餘，筆力沉酣，賦色古幽，以白陽新羅溶諸一冶。偶題小詩，出入晚唐放翁堂奧；雅韵欲流，格律矜愼，卓然成家。人物十餘幀尤以嬰戲圖，閙元宵掉龍燈之作，天趣盎然，無時史氣習。書法二王，而以文衡山王雅宜爲歸。山水畫凡十餘，大都法黃鶴山樵，層精疊嶂，翠壁靑峯，雲氣蒼潤，法古而不爲古所拘泥。其他如臨石溪石濤之作，無不奇境特闢，有引人入勝之概。手卷凡二，臨石田翁山水，周之冕花卉，則一變其木來作風，古拙惇厚之氣度，深得古人三味。疾讀數過，雀躍讚歎。</p>
<p>自國難以來，侯先生　關十年，惟詩畫法書，以自排遣，自晨而暮，出其家藏珍品，撫仿研鑽，髣髴世外人，空山衲子，即子女之啼　號寒，飛機軌軋，轟炸堪怖，而先生不之知也。嗣復往來於澄錫之郊，大江太湖之濱，見夫烟雲苒苒，風浪浩浩，臺以毫端狀之。故能變幻不測，洩大造之秘。今吳稚暉先生以八十二歲之高年，親爲題識，宏獎來學，牡丹綠葉，相得益彰，使先生中心感激，益努力於藝，以副前輩之期許矣。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血138</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>傳達的也沒有，領路的也沒有，鶴見只有照前决那個獨眼鏡紳士所經的小路，渡過了花園。一切的一切，都跟前决的情形簡直一模一樣。大應門前廊上的那個衛隊，鶴見覺得竟是前次晚間的那位老朋友。鶴見的記憶力不差，受過特別訓練，當然不會走眼。</p>
<p>「那裏有這麼巧的事？」鶴見自己心下這們鼓搗着。別府門外一條路上的靜蕩，別府以內的冷靜，和這衛隊崗位的同是一人，呌鶴見禁不住覺得有些蹊蹺古怪。根據調查，別府守崗衛隊有二十餘人之多，又因「隔離」原因，這些衛隊，必定逐日更換。鶴見兩度晉謁，相隔不過兩天，怎麼偏偏又輪到這個人身上？事情雖小，但在特務工作者的眼光中，却是一個値得注意的問題。</p>
<p>鶴見沖着衛隊，點了點頭，剛想問話，以聽得大聽裏步聲響處，在滕朧的燈光下，有人匆匆趕了出來。</p>
<p>「晚安，鶴見君。」又是那位別府秘書。</p>
<p>「晚安……閣下晚安，」鶴見沒有請敎過他的姓名，只得含胡地客氣了一下。</p>
<p>「失禮了，」那位秘書說着，打了一個邀請的手式，回身在前頭走着，過了前决那個候傳室的門，並沒有止步，轉了一個灣，才把鶴見讓進一問較大的客室內。這間客室，不僅比較前回那間候傳室大了一倍，佈置上完全西洋式，頗爲華麗，想是專爲招待外賓及親信的。</p>
<p>「請隨意坐，鶴見君，」秘書的能度，較第一次要親近得多，好像招待一個朋友似的。「相爺現在正忙着公務，大的還要半小時以上時間，才能閒下來。到了傳見的時候，僕，自然曾來請見。……要是有文件的話，請先交下……」說着又是一個半鞠躬。</p>
<p>「文件的話，這裏有一封，是參謀部秘書室，命令在下帶來呈交的。」鶴見說着，便將那封文件，雙手遞給那位秘書。</p>
<p>「有勞，有勞，請寬坐一下。」秘書接過文件，回身待走，看見鶴見似乎還有話說，便站住了。</p>
<p>「前次疏忽，沒有請敎，抱歉得很」。鶴見說着，也來了一個鞠躬。</p>
<p>「西原久計，請敎的話，不敢常得很，希望賜敎。」說着又還了一個鞠躬，正合着「禮多人不怪」那句俗話。</p>
<p>「西原君。」鶴見很敏捷地取出了香烟，預備發動攻勢了。「閣下很忙，在下是知道的。因爲有點疑問，很想叨敎一二，不曉得閣下肯躭擱一兩分鐘嗎？」</p>
<p>「謝謝，僕，烟酒無緣！」西原拒絕了鶴兌的烟，「叨敎的話，不敢當，在職務以內的事，儘願解釋；其他，僕，粗蠢得很，一概不懂。」</p>
<p>要想在日本人嘴裘，撈出一兩句秘密來，那節直等於希望啞巴唱歌，絕對不可能。除非這傢伙是個酒鬼，在酒醉之後，也許可以弄他兩句出來。但鶴見却想憑他的聰明技巧，試上一試。</p>
<p>「大陸的軍務很忙，這是閣下知道的」，鶴見一壁說，一壁看了看手表，「現在已經十點半了，照預計算，在下應當已經飛過海峽了，事實上道時却還站在東京，閣下對道件事，也許肯指導一下：」</p>
<p>「啊，……嗯……哦，……是，……」這是西原的答覆。</p>
<p>「現在是十點半了，」鶴見不肯死心，再來一個攻勢：「閣下說相爺台駕，還要忙到半小時以上，計算一下，在下恐怕要到十一點多，才能晋見？」</p>
<p>「半小時的話，那只是一個假定佔計；」啞巴倒底開口了。「這是相爺說的，僕只能照吩咐的話轉達；除此以外，大概不知道了。」說着，又是半個鞠躬，正式向後轉，出到門外，把門帶上了。</p>
<p>「半小時？…哼！」鶴見望着那傢伙出去了，心下這麼想着，「等罷，我看半小時用不着哩；除非我的計劃完全失敗」！一面冷笑，一面揀了一隻巨型的單人沙發，合身坐了下去，向背上一靠，成了半睡姿式，仰目注視着屋當中掛着的那隻吊燈，狠命吸了幾口烟。</p>

<h3>公共汽車</h3>
<p>— 少夫</p>
<p>公共汔車管理處的工作開展以來，全市區主要交通往來便利不少，市民也受惠匪淺。値得稱頌的。</p>
<p>不過對於路綫問題，我們倒有一點意見，以七路為例，從中正公園到乍浦路橋，而經過狄思威路，嘉興路等處，這是避免了與一路二路電車衝突，設計甚好，但是為什麼直到乍浦路橋為止？為什麼不過橋到北京路外灘，或圓明園路仁記路？因為這一路如過橋，對於虹悶方面的市民將更得到便利。那也可收减少一路電車擁擠雜沓之效。</p>
<p>具有這樣意見的人很多，希望管理處能考慮改善。</p>
<p>其次，十路從靜安寺到外灘，在這一路綫上行駛約有一路二路電車，尤其是二路特別多，所以大多數人主張避免與上列兩路電車行駛相同的路綫，其起點與終點則可照舊。南京路上的車輛也實在太多了，這也可以减少車輛的壅塞。</p>
<p>對於這一點，不知管理處也能考慮否？</p>
<h3>從改資郵票說起</h3>
<p>— 子</p>
<p>「有票皆改，無改不增」。</p>
<p>每天能收到些郵件，本該是一件够愉快的事情。直到現在，我常常還像初戀時之期待情書，米等候着遠方寄來的信件和印刷品，但這種喜悅右時僅僅「曇花一現」就消滅了。因為我常接到比平信走得更慢的航空快信，而異地報紙雙十節的和總理誕辰的特刊居然在仝一天才一起收到！</p>
<p>我早自六歲就開始「美郵」，二十多年來如一日的收集下去，雖然集郵的本子幾次的散失了，我這兩年仍然一白手成家」的儘量蒐集。這或許是一個人的癖好，勞人看來，收集幾個由國內來信的郵票，又有啥意思呢？但我覺得，其中並不見見得沒有意義，或者說，就在這些郵票中可張好些大問題。</p>
<p>「集郵」的「術語」中有所謂「改資郵票」，指那些使用時的票額與原來的並不相同。集郵者都把「改資票」當做一種新的版式而同樣收藏，而且常比原票實貴。近時在寄來郵件中看到的正是這種「改資票」。</p>
<p>我記起：在我已經失掉的集郵册中，當慈禧太后執政時就有過「改資票」，加蓋的鉛字似乎是「暫作洋銀一分」。民國初年也有「改資票」，第一種似乎是三分改二分。此後也繼續有，不過總是把數値較大的改作數目較小，似在假冒作弊，每次發行只有一種，流通時間也不會長久到三兩個月以上，而從不像現在之幾乎「有票皆改，無改不增」。淸楚點說：現在的改資票盡是小票改成大票，而且倍數大得驚人。種類驚人。</p>
<p>我們常說通貨膨脹，不過膨脹到什麼程度，我們到底有點漢然。但每次我看到那黃色一分烈士像郵票已經改為一百元時，算一算，一萬倍，這可把我楞着了。還有呢，三分的改成五百元。或許還有更大的變更倍數。這種「改資」，可作為現代金融史的挿圖吧。</p>
<p>在我先後收集過兩萬多枚的郵票中，以國別而言，最多的當然是中國，其次是德國。德國之多也因為第一次大戰後「改資票」多不可言。後來德國人改不勝以了，祗印空白郵票，票面僅印圖案，票中央有空框子，下頭留下一行空自，多少「馬克」，則臨時用鉛字印上一個簡寫數字在中央框子裏，而下頭就排列一隊「〇」字像操兵？</p>
<p>我收集過的德國火額票，右一枚的票面額達數十億馬克者！</p>
<p>當時我的哥哥經常在一家德國洋行裏取回許多用過的舊信封皮子，我記得很淸是，雖然每封寄來中國的信，郵資是不斷的急劇增加，但每個信封上的郵票十中八九都是僅貼一枚郵票—「改資票」或臨時添印數字的郵票—而很少在兩枚以上的。</p>
<p>（十多年後，聽到說納粹攻入捷克的一切宣傳亦和有價證券都是事變前一兩年就印好備用的，我因此，並不覺到奇異。）</p>
<p>回頭看我們中國吧，郵局一再請寄信人勿貼無數枚小額票以凑成一件郵寄品的郵資，但我最近有一次，為了買一封過重的航快信要用七百五十元郵票，郵員從窗悶裏遞給我的多至十七枚整？而且都是「改資票」！我耐心的，一枚一枚貼完十七枚，一面想起國家要付出三十四倍的印刷費，和郵差消印時，多捺十六下的時間！心裏很難過。</p>
<p>話並沒有完，我這封過重信本來就是凑足四十公分的，（因為省郵費，所以寄出前我總在天平上稱過的），不曉是否我貼的漿糊太厚，我的天，十七枚郵票黏好了以後，重量早已超出四十公分，非再添信資二百五十元不行，但我信封的底面却不容易再黏下這七個郵票了。</p>
<p>信總得寄，我只好在封皮底面批寫着：「請郵員原諒，因為郵窗沒有百元一枚的，不得已以二枚凑合。」</p>
<p>我又在封皮上，註一行字，請收件人退回這個信封給我。我初時僅想當它做集郵品之一，但再深想一下，似乎還可準備有誰寫作「老爺政治」或「官僚主義」時好留給他做插圖。</p>
<p>我從此，發誓再不收集任何「改資票」，我從此當它是一種延誤，浪費與無能的恥辱標記。</p>
<h3>玄想曲</h3>
<p>— 平章</p>
<p>有「王寶寶釧」者，乃「傾國傾城」之「亂世佳人」，身負「反攻緬甸」及「直搗東京」之「秘密使命」。</p>
<p>一日「王實釧」携「秘密武器」，探「納粹內幕」；不幸被「黑龍會」之「日本間諜」所困，幸賴「天字第一號」之「神槍手」相救得以「逃生」。</p>
<p>「王寶釧」貌如「出水美蓉」，雖「鐵骨冰心」，亦不禁落入「在戀」之「沉淵」。「王寳釧」雖也有「比翼雙飛」之想，然「落花有主」，伊已獻身「為國効勞」，故不願「自尋煩惱」。「神槍手」却「硬漢痴情」，於「聖誕節」函的「愛人」赴「女兒城」，共渡此「狂歡節」；並備「金鋼鑽」，及「寶石花」為禮物；然「王寳釧」却覆之曰：</p>
<p>「神槍手」：</p>
<p>君乃「好靑年」，請勿因「桃色煩惱！」</p>
<p>祖國在「血肉山河」之際，正是「少年立志」之「秋」！祈加入「諜報敢死團」，或「遊擊敢死隊」，為「不屈服之中國」爭光，燃起「民族之火花」，「與我同行」，則「重逢有日一矣！祝</p>
<p>「前程萬里」！</p>
<p>一神槍手」果然成一「熱血男兒」，「勇冠三軍」，「奪回中途島」，為「前進之中國」開一「血路」！</p>
<h3>早茶</h3>
<p>— 方文</p>
<p>淸晨起身，一杯早茶，可以淸心，可以益壽。</p>
<p>中國早茶，燒餅豆漿油條稀飯，最為普遍，外國早茶，牛乳吐司鷄蛋麥片，大同小異，雖是中外習俗不同，其取材要以輕淸鬆淡則一也。</p>
<p>古有攝生要訣：『早餐要早，午餐要飽，晚餐要少。』可見早茶，除取材輕淸鬆淡外，還以早為宜。</p>
<p>上海富貴之家，每晨喜啖參湯銀耳燕窩鷄汁，以代早茶，據說淸晨進補，效力特大。</p>
<p>鄕間農民久有吃早茶之風，鎭上村間，小茶館裏，茅屋紙窗，板檯長櫈，，一早就羣賢畢至，正所謂：『座上客常滿，壹中茶不空。」一壺淸茶，幾口黃烟，高談闊論，天南地北，無拘無束。</p>
<p>廣東人對宵夜和早茶，一樣考究，蘇州人對早茶，也很道地，是每天的必修枓，南京人久有吃早茶的名氣，上海人雖有吃早茶的習慣，可是未免太晚，終覺有失去早字的意義。</p>

<h3>叫化子的組織24</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉謨</p>
<p>蛇與丐的秘密</p>
<p>蛇丐時常代民家捕捉毒蛇以取酬報。凡是富人庭國中有蛇為患者，便僱他們去捕捉，百無一失。蛇丐也都樂於為此，並不居奇苛求。這並不是蛇丐重義輕財，乃是捕得之蛇有時價値極高，民家總是無條件奉送給他。在內地每個區域的各鄉鎭中，每月總有固定的蛇丐巡行經過着。</p>
<p>凡事有利皆有弊。有些蛇丐刁黠成性，他們有時為了生意清淡，便暗地裹把訓練有素的蛇放到富戶園庭裏去，雖未必有毒，但有害孩童及家畜，時常鬧得鷄犬不寗。於是富戶祇好請敎他去捕捉，於是取得厚利。有時富戶不來請敎，蛇丐便自薦地登門叩見，聲稱貴府有毒蛇為禍，民家如因未覺察而不信其言，蛇丐便自稱能辨蛇味，百無一失。願意先捉後酬，為除無窮之害。民家畏禍自然答應。於是蛇丐便大顯身手，先自吹奏一枝短笛，歌調鳴咽動聽。那蛇聽得出丐主的笛聲，靑把食物引誘，蛇使自動走出就縛。蛇丐得酬洋之後，仍舊囊蛇而去，又可以重新施放到他家了。大概捉放的時間距離不出十天，日子過久蛇得新穴，或是遠還他處。幫中人稱為「埋地龍失撽」。那紙好自認晦氣，所謂「偸鷄不着蝕把米」是也。</p>
<p>蛇丐自動去捉蛇來殺，把蛇膽蛇皮去售賣給路人的。也是一種經常生意。名為「抄貨色」。</p>
<p>善男信女有放生習慣，蛇丐利用佛門子弟的心理，把捉到的中小型的蛇，賣人放生。在西子湖畔，逢到佛門節季。朝山晋香者擁擠之時，最是他們的黃道吉日。賣蛇的生意十分的興隆。此類都屬無毒的水蛇，今天放了生，明天又為蛇丐捉回來再賣。那些管佛廟放生池的和尙，不免和蛇丐暗通聲氣，讓蛇丐再來捉蛇去賣。結果祇是驅騙善男信女的錢罷了。</p>
<p>蛇糞是蛇身上最値錢的東西。但因蛇糞難得，物以稀為貴，蛇丐如取得蛇糞稱爲變了金，原來蛇糞，便是「　黃」，除了在中國藥譜上是名貴的藥品外，在顏料中是最好的天然黃色，價値極昂，每次「變了金」，才是蛇丐傲視儕輩的富麗日子。</p>
<p>蛇丐最有勢力的幫派呌做「盤花桿子」。該幫祖傳蛇藥，　　大江南北。對於捕取大蛇，經騐豐富。他們活勵的區域都是氣候溫和的華中。長江南北，足跡是不越關外的。幫中稱　「不上寨」。寨就是指山海關，函谷關而言。因為關外氣候寒冷，蛇類是不易生存的。新丐入幫，規律極嚴，須先投師拜祖，先跟師傳做了三年下手「架桿子」的工作，按即捉蛇養蛇之謂。俟藝成方可上街乞討，開始以蛇丐姿態與世人相見。</p>
<h3>返國紀感</h3>
<p>— 亢石</p>
<p>三十六年的元旦，突然天公作美，大放「光明」，眞是一個吉兆，筆者於是乘假期之會，返閔作一次省親。而在見聞中，得到兩件感想。</p>
<p>第一件是濃人呌苦，米價賤而傷農，而棉花更比米便宜，所以四鄕的農村，其購買力較前年相差極巨。本來閔行以居水陸要衝的關係，以花米業為大宗，今者受不景氣打擊，雖未見有「倒閉」發生，但傳說也有好幾家難以維持了，而看到全鎭的商業，更見冷落凋零，不勝今昔之慨！際茲三十六年履端于始，在此「一農敗百商」的情景下，眞够憂慮！</p>
<p>第二件是聽說資源委員會在鎭西浦濱，圈購民田五百畝，開闢機器廠，早已醞釀了半年，現正開始實行，在圈的「民田」，「民屋」，「墳墓」，分別作價收買或令遷讓，民田已多領價收買，並不成間題，而「民屋」和「墳墓」，却引起了鄕民的騷動。聽說因為「遷讓費」太小，而民力困窮，雖然開闢機器廠，對國家助建設，對地方興市面，但這許多的「民屋」以極小的代價，如何時人另找住身？而「墳墓」的遷讓費祗有數萬元，中國的習俗，素極注重先人的骨殖，為了國家要建設，不去講迷信的風水，但人工和公墳費，豈是數萬元之數，就可遷移者？所以被圈的民衆，與論譁然，現當局已改變方針，傳說被圈的「民屋」，准其入廠為工，墳墓則另圈公墓移葬，但是是否能够實現，還看當局能否「體恤民艱」？我們覺得「為政之道在乎仁」，不要顧此而失彼！</p>
<h3>三毛</h3>
<p>— 張樂平</p>
<p>星期雜談</p>
<h3>談中國字</h3>
<p>— 德采</p>
<p>關於複音字這一問題，在「自由談」上已一再討論，但據愚見，在討論這一問題之前，似覺對於漢字的本質意囊，先得有研究討論一番的價値。</p>
<p>據筆者的武斷：中國的語言是世界上最優秀的語言；中國的文字是世界上最優秀的文字。</p>
<p>簡明</p>
<p>語言是用于種聲音以代表一種意思或事物，文字是用一種記號以代表一種意思事物，最主要的條件是簡單，明晰，淸楚。我國的言語完全以單音以代表單字，以單字以代表一個單獨的意義或事物，簡明得不能再一間明。如桌，單音，英語則為組勃兒（Table），日語則為芝柯哀（杌）都是三個音，速率的比較是三與一之比。所以發表同一意義的演講稿，用中文講，至少可以比世界任何國家，節省二分之一時間以上。這種優點是世界任何國家所望塵莫及的。</p>
<p>文字也是如此：世界各國的文字都是綫體的，可以無限度地向後延仲；獨有我國的文字是平面化的，限制非常嚴格，規定一小方塊的空間，是一個字，代表一種意義或事物，而且這一個字限用單音。所以一篇中文文稿，如果用世界任何各國的文字來翻譯，都比中文長決不會比中文短。用同一方法，記錄同一意義的事情，在文字方面，可以節省時間，節省料材，應推中文第一。</p>
<p>簡化</p>
<p>依據上述理由，創造複音字，不但好像在盲目模仿歐化，實際却似在開倒車。「　」，是創造新字，此字可音館，意義是圖書館；應用在文宇方面，可以怖省時間，確有可取。擴而充之，如果能得次衆公認，我們不妨多造幾個類同的字：圈，　，　，　，　，　，　，以上數字都音館，但意義不同：（一）照相館，（二）飯館，（三）茶館，（四）影戲館。（五）戲誼，（六）殯儀館，（七）體育館。如此一來，□在字典上顯然成功了另一新部，意義却是一個團體。</p>
<p>至於我國習用的聯字，如：「鳳凰」，「鴛鴦」，「梧桐」，「枇杷」，是同一類別雌雄兩性不同的分析，這也是我國文字的精細處，現在强欲使之合併，混為　，　，似覺畫蛇添足，反而糊塗。</p>
<p>不過因上節的啓示，我們覺得：文字越簡越好，筆劃越少越好，將現在的繁複漢字，儘最使之簡化，則確有提倡的價値。例如：「价」以代「價」；「　」以代「門」；「　」—「時」；「鉀」—「鐘」；「步」—「歲」；「斷」—「斷」；「点」—「點」；「鉄」—「鐵」；「獻」—「獻」；「　」—「戲」；「双」—「雙」，以上不過略舉變個例，實際可以節化的字，一定不少。如此一改對於時間的經濟，定有極大利益。</p>
<p>再有我國的虛字，也是被人認為神秘而又頭固的東西，其實虛字就是語體文中的標點：「也」—。「乎」—？「耶」—？「焉」—；「歟」—？！「哉」—！？「之」—，「者」—；「耳」—…</p>
<p>所以文言文中的虛字，實際是我國的老式標點。比較起來不及新式簡單，應該被淘汰。</p>
<p>再有文言文和語體文的分別，文言文是語體文的速記體，雖然不通俗，對於普及通俗敎育，採作入門時的敎材，確有失當，但用以速記，自有其不可抹煞的地位和價値。文言文的末落，一是受了一般文化水準的低落，（二）寫文言文的人對於速記的技巧幼稚，及們　標點——即虛字—所致。中國文化張揚後，如欲節省時間，使文章簡化起見仍會和文言文接近的。</p>
<p>優秀</p>
<p>中國的文字實際是太優秀了，若干人非但不知加以愛惜，反而輕視它，認為是落伍的。漢字的確有它固有的價値，希望「自由談」能提交星期雜談，作為專題，讓大家多發表些意見來討論研究，以決定漢字究竟優秀不優秀！</p>

        <h1>1947.01.05</h1>
<h3>The Government Is Currently Seeking a "Key" to Reopen the Door to Peace Talks; The National Government's Executive Yuan Decides to Reorganize First</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] When Wu Tiecheng met with reporters on the 4th, he said: The government is determined to reorganize the Executive and National Government, but the National Assembly has just concluded and it is also the New Year holiday, so time is short. Therefore, consultations with various parties participating in the National Assembly on the reorganization of the government are still in the initial exploratory stage. The government has not yet had formal contact with the Nanjing delegation of the Chinese Communist Party, but the government would sincerely welcome the CCP and the Democratic League if they could participate in the government. The government has always hoped to reopen peace talks in order to achieve peaceful unification, and hopes that parties that did not participate in the National Assembly can also participate in the government.</p>
<p>The government has decided to reorganize the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan first, according to the established steps. Whether the Legislative Yuan will be expanded is still under consideration by the government. Regarding the reports that opposition parties advocate expanding the Legislative Yuan to formulate various regulations related to the constitution, Wu said: The Legislative Yuan is part of the government, so participating in the Legislative Yuan also means participating in the government. As for the reorganization of the National Government Committee, some people believe that if the CCP and the Democratic League fail to participate and the seats on the committee remain vacant, the number of members from other parties participating in the reorganized government will be very small, and they will not be able to compete with the overwhelming majority of KMT members on the committee. Wu said: The government did not decide everything by an overwhelming majority when the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party participated in the National Assembly. Based on past cooperative experience, he firmly believes that cooperation will not be impossible in the National Government Committee. After the National Government Committee is established in the future, the Supreme National Defense Council will be abolished, and how to reorganize the Executive Yuan will be decided in the National Government Committee meeting. There will be no changes in local governments for the time being, because local governments can be reorganized at any time as long as the central government deems it necessary.</p>
<p>Wu said: The work of the government cannot be suspended for a single day. Peace talks and the reorganization of the government should proceed simultaneously. We are now seeking a "key" to reopen the door to peace talks.</p>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in This City] Zeng Qi, Chairman of the Youth Party, and Standing Committee members Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, and Chang Naide, have arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing separately. It is reported that the party's standing committee regular meeting will be held in Shanghai within days to discuss the issue of participating in the government reorganization. When the reporter asked Chen Qitian yesterday whether he had met with Secretary-General Wu recently, he said: Party members in Nanjing had contacted Wu, but they have not met since returning to Shanghai, but they will definitely have the opportunity to meet again within days. Zhou Qianchong also said that recently, members of the party met with Zhang Junmai and Zhang Dongsun of the Social Democratic Party to exchange views, mentioning that Ambassador Stuart Leighton hoped that China could quickly restore a peaceful environment to facilitate the implementation of the constitution. Therefore, the party is now working hard to promote the resumption of peace talks between the KMT and the CCP. Zhou also said: We hope that if peace talks can be resumed, they must achieve true and lasting peace, and not create the dragged-out situation of the past, so as to actually benefit the overall situation.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 4th] The new chairman, Zhang Zhizhong, has become the center of political activities in the current capital. Zhang has been meeting with various parties all day, and it is rumored that he is currently studying ways to resume peace talks. Zhang, accompanied by Pi Zonggan, a staff officer of the National Government, visited Special Envoy Marshall on the afternoon of the 4th and had talks. Zhang also visited Ambassador Marshall on the 3rd. It is rumored that Zhang's arrival in Nanjing is related to peace talks, which is not without reason.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 4th] Shao Lizi recently told reporters that the reports in the newspapers of Nanjing and Shanghai on the 4th that there was an important meeting at the chairman's official residence on the evening of the 3rd are inaccurate.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 4th] Dong Biwu, director of the CCP Liaison Office, is scheduled to hold a press conference at 4 pm on the 5th to express his views on the current general situation. At the same time, he will also report on the Yellow River breach project. This will be the only press conference of the CCP after Zhou Enlai's flight to Yan'an was postponed. Mei Yi, the CCP spokesperson, solemnly stated to reporters tonight that the rumors that Dong Biwu would return to Yan'an or that Yan'an might send personnel to Nanjing are absolutely untrue.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Issues Statement: Coming to Nanjing Purely for Reporting on Work, No Other Missions; Plans to Return to Chaoxian County, Anhui to Sweep Tombs Soon</h3>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 4th] General Zhang Zhizhong, Chairman of Xinjiang Province, arrived in Nanjing the day before yesterday. Reporters specially went to meet him on the 4th. Zhang first explained that his return to Nanjing was purely to report on his work. He continued: Although he had only been in office as chairman of Xinjiang for nine months, he had been away from Nanjing for more than ten years, and it was difficult to avoid a sense of estrangement from the recent political developments. Zhang also told reporters in a humorous tone that the reports that he planned to play the role of a matchmaker again and mediate peace were new tasks assigned to him by the press. Zhang also said that the future administrative policy of Xinjiang Province would be carried out entirely in accordance with the drafted administrative program. At the same time, he would pay attention to the national spirit of the Three Principles of the People, protect the educational, economic, and political interests of ethnic minorities, and the current priority was to assist in improving the lives of local people and stabilizing prices. Since Chairman Zhang arrived in Nanjing, he has been very busy with socializing. He visited the Chairman on the 3rd and attended a luncheon at the invitation of Special Envoy Marshall today. Zhang also stated that he personally plans to return to his hometown of Chaoxian County, Anhui, to sweep the tombs soon.</p>
<h3>The American Christian Science Monitor Analyzes the Relationship between the KMT and the CCP in Detail</h3>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in New York on the 3rd] The Christian Science Monitor recently published news about the promulgation of the new constitution in Nanjing on half of the first page. The newspaper printed photos of Chairman Chiang, Stuart Leighton, Marshall, Song Ziwen, and Mao Zedong around an article by its Shanghai-based reporter on the new constitution, and analyzed the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in detail under the title of the New Constitution. It is said that although the CCP claims to boycott the new constitution, the door to participating in the government has not been closed, because there is still a cautious hope for resuming negotiations to end the internal strife. The newspaper also has another article discussing China's long and painful journey toward a constitutional government.</p>
<h3>President Yu's Broadcast</h3>
<p>Encouraging Citizens to Fulfill Their Responsibilities</p>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 4th] President Yu was invited by the Central Broadcasting Station on the 3rd to speak on "The New China After the Promulgation of the Constitution." Yu believed that the formulation of the constitution was the cornerstone for the success of national construction. Yu pointed out that after the implementation of the constitution, the Kuomintang would formally transfer political power to the people to fulfill their long-held aspirations. In the future, the rise and fall of the country will depend entirely on the people's ability to fulfill their responsibilities as masters of the country. From the date of the promulgation of the constitution to the date of its implementation, during this period, the National Government will naturally implement the preparations according to the procedures of the constitution, but how to carefully select the worthy and capable to represent the people in supervising the government depends entirely on all the people. If we want to succeed in building a truly democratic country, every citizen must fulfill their responsibilities, especially the responsibility of upholding and implementing the constitution.</p>
<h3>The Democratic League's Second Plenary Session to Be Held in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in This City] The second plenary session of the Democratic League is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on the 6th. The preparatory meeting ended on the 3rd.

<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 4th] Regarding the incident of American soldiers raping female students in Beiping, the Executive Yuan's instructions to the Ministry of Education and local governments are as follows: "It is reported that two American soldiers in Beiping committed the act of raping Chinese female students. It is now learned that the American side has handed over the offending American soldiers to military trial in accordance with the law, and our Beiping Municipal Government is also negotiating on the spot. This matter is the personal behavior of the offending American soldiers, and the offenders should be sanctioned by law. As for the friendship between China and the United States, it should not be damaged as a result of this. No one should use this kind of personal behavior as an excuse to damage our friendly nations or the people of friendly nations. All school authorities and local administrative agencies should earnestly follow this principle and be responsible for dissuading. If there are any actions that may be out of line, they should also be responsible for stopping them."</p>
<h3>The Ambassador Lacks an Opinion</h3>
<p>This Matter Is Not Related to the Overall Issue</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 4th] Howard, Commander of the U.S. Military in the Beiping-Tianjin Area, arrived in Nanjing on the 3rd to report the incident involving the U.S. military in Beiping to Ambassadors Marshall and Leighton. He also visited Bai Chongxi in the morning and had talks before returning to Beiping. When our reporter visited Ambassador Stuart Leighton recently and asked for his opinion on this matter, the ambassador said: This is a matter of American military law and is not related to the overall issue.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 4th] Students in Nanjing launched demonstrations for the past two days regarding the rape of female students by American soldiers in Beiping. The schools have returned to calm on the 4th. Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua visited Ambassador Stuart Leighton at 11:30 am and discussed the matter. When reporters visited Zhu in the evening and asked for his opinion on the incident, he said: This matter is a legal issue and should be handled according to law. The students' march and petition were not mentioned to him and are now in the past.</p>
<h3>Fu Sinian's Remarks</h3>
<p>[Report from the United News Agency in Nanjing on the 4th] Fu Sinian, director of the Department of History at the Academia Sinica, told the United News Agency reporter today regarding the student demonstrations that the students in various schools mistakenly treated an event unrelated to politics as a political event. This case is certainly extremely regrettable, but it is purely a legal matter. When the reporter asked him about the students' request for the withdrawal of American troops from China, Fu replied: Allowing American troops to stay in China is entirely a matter of the Chinese government's policy. If students are dissatisfied with this policy, they can petition the government. Sixteen months ago, American troops fought side by side with the Chinese army against a common enemy. In the past ten months, American troops have also assisted the Chinese government in repatriating Japanese prisoners. This task has not yet ended, and there are still a large number of Japanese soldiers in China who have not been disarmed. Chinese intellectuals should have a long-term vision of international politics and must recognize that China cannot be isolated internationally.</p>
<p>[Report from the United Press Agency in Nanjing on the 4th] Thousands of students from various universities in Nanjing held demonstrations on the 3rd, demanding the withdrawal of American troops from China. Afterwards, the organizers hosted reporters from various newspapers. When the reporters raised various questions, the three student representatives who spoke were unable to answer fluently. One reporter insisted on explaining the true meaning of their demonstrations. The student representatives conferred and whispered to each other for a long time. Finally, one of them stammered, "You reporters cannot interrogate us with this complicated question. We are just students, and what we know is limited." The reporter then raised a question saying: They demanded the withdrawal of American troops from China, is Special Envoy Marshall also included in this case? Why did they not mention a word about the Soviet troops still stationed in various parts of the Northeast in the demands they put forward? The student representatives hesitated and replied, "We have not yet considered that question. This question needs to be decided by all the students?" Afterwards, the reporters raised a number of questions, but could not get to the point, and left in disappointment.</p>
<h3>Zou Lu Suffers a Stroke</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 4th] Member of the Central Executive Committee, Zou Lu, suffered a stroke suddenly on the evening of the 3rd due to his advanced age and has been sent to the Central Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>The Chairman Personally Sent a Letter to Xiong Shihui; Jiang Jingguo Had Already Handed It Over to Liu Yuzhang When He Was in Shenyang to Discuss the Restoration of Order in Andong</h3>

[Report from Our Newspaper in Shenyang on the 4th] Liu Yuzhang, commander of the New Second Army, came to Shenyang from Andong to report to Commander Du on the security situation along the Yalu River. According to reports: Ji'an, located southeast of Tonghua, has been formally taken over, and order has been restored, but the local area has been severely damaged by the Communist army. The Yalu River coast is quite peaceful. According to people from Andong: There are often boats secretly crossing between Andong and Korea, smuggling opium. It is rumored that the opium is purchased from Korea, with each ounce costing about 800 yuan in circulating notes and 4,000 yuan in the Andong black market.</p>
<p>[Report from the Central News Agency in Changchun on the 4th] Military Information: (1) In the area of Tongchantun, Jiangjiadian, and Gushanzi, 70 li east of Liuhe, there are about 20,000 troops of the Communist army led by Li Hongguang stationed, carrying two steel cannons and more than 200 light and heavy machine guns, with unclear intentions. (2) The Communist army in the area of Huinan, Jinchuan, and Mengjiang, which belong to Andong Province, has been frequently mobilized in recent days and may seize the opportunity to encroach again. (3) The Communist army has recently sent a group of workers to infiltrate outside Jilin City, disguised as civilians, specializing in detaining or assassinating refugees who have fled from the Communist areas.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Changchun on the 4th] The U.S. representative of the Committee of Three suggested that the government and the Communist Party representatives review the gains and losses of the past at the beginning of the year to encourage future efforts. The three parties discussed the restoration of the group. The government representative expressed welcome, but the Communist Party representative said that the time was not ripe and refused.</p>

The Ma Lianliang case has not yet had any outcome. The Hebei High Court announced the sentences of two traitors today. One was Xiao Yiyuan, the chief secretary of the puppet Public Works Bureau, who was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment, and the other was Lu Kuanfu, the special service squad leader of the puppet North China Transportation Company, who was sentenced to four years of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Li Sichong Discusses the Powers of the Control Yuan: Great Changes After the Promulgation of the Constitution Compared to the Past</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Beiping on the 4th] Li Sichong, the Hebei Inspector, returned to Beiping the day before yesterday and met with reporters today, saying: Outside rumors about the Control Yuan being reorganized are inaccurate. He had not heard of this matter when he met with President Yu in Nanjing. However, after the promulgation of the Constitution, the powers of the Control Yuan have greatly changed compared to the past. Before leaving Nanjing, the Control Yuan had held several meetings to discuss changing various laws and regulations to adapt to this new situation. According to reports, the changes in the Constitutional Control Yuan are as follows: (1) A new power of consent has been added. The appointment of the Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan and the members of the Examination Yuan of the Examination Yuan must be approved by the Control Yuan. (2) In the past, the Control Yuan had a temporary power of impeachment. Now this power is formal. Those who are impeached must be dealt with or replied by their competent authorities within one month, which is faster than impeachment in the past. (3) The past suggestions have been changed to the power of correction.</p>
<h3>The Council of Advisors Resident Committee Continued to Meet Yesterday; The General Budget Was Largely Reviewed; Three People Were Assigned to Investigate the Shanghai Plane Crash</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 4th] The Resident Committee of the Council of Advisors held its third temporary meeting at 9 am on the 4th. Only Si Nian, Zuo Shunsheng, and others attended. Wu Yifang presided over the meeting. First, Lin Wei, Vice Minister of National Defense, reported the main points of the National Defense Budget. According to the administrative policy, the number of soldiers should be reduced, and the demobilization and demobilization work should be completed. The total amount is more than 3 trillion, accounting for 40% of the total budget. Then, Zhao Zhuanyao, Director of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, supplemented the explanation. Councilors Meng Ge Chen, Yin Shuxian, Zhang Boling, and others spoke one after another, raising questions. Their opinions were roughly as follows: (1) Reduce military spending. The current budget and the number of people do not match. (2) There are too many officers and soldiers, and the cost of food and fodder is not enough. (3) The budget compilation is not a matter of percentage and the size of the amount, but whether the content is reasonable or not. (4) Non-combat personnel should be reduced. (5) Improve the treatment of soldiers. (6) Abolish the conscription of military grain? (7) Demobilized officers and soldiers should be guaranteed. (8) The military budget does not need to be reduced, but it is hoped that it will not exceed the budget. (9) There are many abuses in conscription, and the treatment of civil and military officials is very different. The above questions were answered separately by Lin and Zhao. Then it was decided to divide into three groups for review. The first group reviewed national defense and military affairs, the second group reviewed finance and finance, and the third group reviewed other matters. Regarding the Shanghai plane crash, the previous meeting decided to organize an investigation committee. Today, Jiang Yong, Yin Shuxian, and Zheng Kuiyi were appointed as investigation committee members to be responsible for investigating the cause of the accident. The meeting adjourned at 1 pm. The review meeting was held at 3 pm and adjourned at 6 pm. The general budget has been largely reviewed and is scheduled to submit a report at the fourth temporary meeting at 9 am on the 5th.</p>

<h3>Minister Peng Discusses This Year's Characteristics: In Politics, It Will Be the Beginning of Constitutionalism; In Economics, It Will Be Diligent Work</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city report] Peng Xuepei, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, in order to celebrate the New Year and the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China, held a cocktail party at the Hua Mao Hotel on the 8th floor yesterday afternoon to entertain famous Chinese and foreign figures in this city, major figures from the Minshe Party, the Youth Party, and people from the Chinese and foreign press. Xu Jiguang, Wang Xiaolai, Chang Naixian of the Youth Party, Chen Qitian, Zhou Shuichong, Cui Wanqiu, and British Naval Liaison Officer Colonel Zoss were present, as well as News Office Director Lieutenant Oder, US News Office Director Cowell, French News Office Director Gan Mo, and more than a hundred people in charge of Chinese and foreign newspapers, news agencies, and magazines in this city. Minister Peng was the target of interviews by journalists at the meeting. Mr. Peng mingled among them and answered some questions from reporters. The grand event ended at 5:30. Minister Peng issued a written statement at yesterday's reception, the original text of which is as follows: "A country with a population of 400 million, including many ethnic groups such as Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan, unanimously agreed to enact a constitution in 40 days. This has to be said to be an astonishing fact. Even the Chinese Communists, who oppose everything, signed and approved the basic principles of this constitution during the Political Consultative Conference. The smooth passage of this constitution may seem easy, but it is actually the result of the six decades of revolution and resistance led by the founding father Sun Yat-sen and President Chiang Kai-shek. Now that we have this constitution, we can only achieve peace, unity, and democracy by adhering to it together and resolving all disputes in accordance with it.</p>
<p>China's economic life has not seen significant improvement one and a half years after the victory. The reason is very simple. The destruction in various places during the eight years of the War of Resistance and after the war was severe, which is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. Let me give a few examples to illustrate.</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, there were 112,000 kilometers of highways within the passes before the war, and 14,000 kilometers were newly built in the rear during the War of Resistance. Now, at least 50,000 kilometers of these highways need to be repaired. Before the war, it cost about 10,000 yuan to repair one kilometer of highway. Now, it costs 100 million yuan per kilometer, a price increase of 10,000 times. The repair cost is also at least 20 million yuan per kilometer on average before the road can be used. That is to say, just repairing the existing highways will require one trillion yuan.</p>
<p>The railways were damaged during the war, and 2,700 kilometers have not been repaired yet, all of which are south of the Yangtze River. Another 1,900 kilometers were destroyed by the Chinese Communists after the war and have not been repaired, all of which are north of the Longhai Railway. In total, about 4,600 kilometers of old roads need to be repaired. Before the war, the average construction cost per kilometer of railway was 100,000 yuan. Now, it is an average of 1 billion yuan per kilometer. The degree of damage to each road is very severe, and repairs are almost equivalent to reconstruction. Just repairing the old railways will cost about 4.8 trillion yuan.</p>
<p>The only important industry left over from the War of Resistance is the textile industry. Two years before the war, domestic cotton production had reached self-sufficiency. Now, the number of spindles has decreased, and three-quarters of the cotton relies on foreign imports, consuming huge amounts of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Before the war, the annual coal production within the passes was 20 million tons. Now, it has fallen to 8 million tons. The loss of power and transportation equipment in the coal mines within the passes is about 80 percent. Recently, the Datong Coal Mine, which was in very good condition, was completely destroyed again.</p>
<p>Of course, we took over some factories from the enemy and puppets. These machines were quite useful during the wartime blockade. Now that the country is open, given the competition from new foreign machines, most of those machines can probably only be regarded as scrap iron.</p>
<p>The seriousness of housing shortages is no less than other items. Taking Jiangxi as an example, three-quarters of the houses in the provincial capital Nanchang were destroyed. Among the 83 counties in the province, more than 30 counties lost one-fifth of their residential buildings. As a result, refugees who have been displaced cannot return to their hometowns. Full recovery may take a century. If one province is like this, others can be imagined.</p>
<p>Before the war, three major rivers in central China flowed into the ocean: the Yellow River, the Huai River, and the Yangtze River. As a result of various destructions during the War of Resistance, the Yellow River and the Huai River both carry huge amounts of sediment into the Yangtze River, causing a gradual silting hazard. Now, the first thing to do is to move the two rivers back to their original courses separately. The funds required are difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>After these damages and losses, recovery requires first cash, second materials, third manpower, and fourth time. None of these four can be done overnight. Under the current situation, ruins are everywhere across the country, factories and mines are destroyed, transportation is blocked, fuel is scarce, and raw materials are lacking. The national economic problem is a material problem, a difficult problem, and it cannot be solved simply by adjusting exchange rates, tariffs, tax systems, or other theoretical policies on paper. The only way out is to work hard in construction with blood and sweat under extreme austerity.</p>
<p>The characteristics of this year will be the beginning of constitutionalism in politics and a life of hard work and diligent work in economics."</p>

<h3>The Siege of Jinxiang, Western Shandong, Is Lifted; The Communist Army's Attack on Xuzhou Fails; The Plan to Emulate the Japanese Army's Death-Defying Encirclement Is Shattered; The National Army in Jixiang Withdraws Automatically to Avoid Damage</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 4th dispatch] The Communist army emulated the old trick of the Japanese army in the Battle of Xuzhou, attempting to launch a circular offensive against the National Army in Xuzhou from the east and west. Now, it has obviously failed. The Yang Yong Column under Liu Bocheng's command on the western route captured Juye on the 2nd and occupied Jiaxiang. After the Jinxiang National Army, they intended to go straight to Dangshan, following the example of Doihara, to cut off the Longhai Railway. Unexpectedly, the National Army of Caozhou launched a joint counterattack, and by the 4th, the siege of Jinxiang was lifted. The remnants of Yang Yong's army have also begun to flee north. The Chen Yi's troops on the eastern route launched a fierce attack on the National Army's positions near Xiangcheng southwest of Linyi before dawn on the 3rd, also intending to imitate the attacks on Zaocheng and Iitani, directly taking Taierzhuang and threatening the northeast of Xuzhou. The National Army in that area took rapid action and fought a bloody battle with the invading Communist army for a day and night, and by the 4th, their attempt was also shattered.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 4th dispatch] Kuoxian County in western Shandong was once recovered by the National Army and local militias last month. However, due to the Communist army's Liu Bocheng's troops transferring a large number of troops from Fanxian Guancheng and other places to attack, the National Army transferred to outposts outside the city to avoid sacrifices. Now, the National Army re-entered the city on the afternoon of the 2nd. Except for a small number of Communist troops fleeing, the rest were captured. In addition, Guancheng County was also recovered by the National Army on the afternoon of the 2nd. The Communist Army's Yellow River Detachment and the Sixth Regiment of the Fourth Column fled to Chaocheng.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 4th dispatch] It is learned that: (1) The National Army stationed in Jiaxiang on the right wing of Juye withdrew from the city automatically on the 2nd to avoid being attacked by the Communist army and causing damage. (2) The Communist army increased its troops and fiercely attacked Jinxiang. The defending National Army stubbornly resisted, and the battle was extremely tragic. The National Army's support team outside the line has advanced to Xiaobian, about ten kilometers southeast of Jinxiang, and the crisis in the city has been lifted. (3) The Communist army's Fourth and Ninth Divisions, the New Seventh and Tenth Divisions, and the First and Eighth Divisions, totaling more than 30,000 people, suddenly attacked the National Army's positions in Jia Village, Ka Village, and other places on the outskirts of Yixian at 10:00 p.m. on the 3rd. The battle was extremely fierce. In order to reduce losses, the National Army withdrew the guard posts stationed in Shangyan, Qingshan, Shicheng, Chuanshankou, and other places, and is now fiercely fighting on the Xinxing, Yulou, and Xingming lines.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 4th dispatch] The Communist army's New Tenth and Eighth Divisions, with about three to four thousand people, are currently fleeing to Xiadian Baojiagou, east of Peixian, and there is a trend of crossing Weishan Lake and attacking westward.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Zhenjiang, 4th dispatch] The National Army advancing north from Funing recovered Dongkan, an important stronghold of the Communist army, on the evening of the 1st. On the afternoon of the 2nd, fierce fighting occurred with the Communist army's Fifth Division in Daxiaoliuzhuang. By the evening, the Communist army continued to retreat north, and the National Army entered the Daxiaoliuzhuang line on the morning of the 3rd. There are no official Communist troops within 60 li north of Yining. The so-called militia coerced in Yancheng Funing have voluntarily surrendered to the National Army in recent weeks, reaching 5,000.</p>
<h3>The Ordeal of the Breakthrough from Liaocheng; Mr. Wang Jinxiang's Account</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jinan, 4th dispatch] The soldiers and civilians who broke through from Liaocheng arrived in Qihe on the evening of the 3rd. Wang Jinxiang, the commissioner of the Sixth District who defended the city, came to Jinan immediately and reported the ordeal to Chairman Wang Yaowu. At noon, he attended a banquet hosted by the heads of the provincial government departments, and in the afternoon, he led personnel to carry comfort goods and food to Qihe to comfort all the soldiers and civilians. The provincial government rushed to provide emergency relief, distributing a bag of flour and a set of cotton clothes to each person, and set up three refugee shelters and a temporary middle school to provide accommodation and relief. Mr. Wang told reporters about the ordeal of the breakthrough, saying: The city was besieged on New Year's Eve of the 34th year and lasted for a year. On New Year's Eve last year, the National Army's reinforcements arrived in Liaocheng. At 12 o'clock that night, it was decided to break through. At 2:00 a.m. on New Year's Day, the troops led a breakthrough from Dongguan, including 2,000 officers and soldiers, more than 100 party and government personnel, and 800 civilians. They encountered the Communist Army's Seventh Column and Thirteenth Column twice on the way to Dinghui, northeast of Liaocheng. The Communist army suffered more than 2,000 casualties. On the evening of the 2nd, they stayed in Ershilibao, Hongmiao, and Baigang (near Renping). During the siege of the city, the Communist army launched many fierce attacks, and the soldiers and civilians of the whole city worked together to defend it, and fortunately, they were able to preserve the isolated city. At this moment, almost all the houses in the city have been destroyed by the Communist army's artillery fire, but there are still four priests and more than ten elderly, sick, and disabled people left in the city.</p>
<h3>Summer Uniforms for the Army; The Military Cap Will Be Changed to a Boat Shape</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 4th dispatch] After the army uniform was changed to a new style last year, due to the excessive amount of materials required, it is heard that the summer uniform this year may be changed to a boat shape.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army in Hebei Holds a Meeting in Yixian, Planning to Launch a Spring Offensive; The Communist Army Gathers on the Banks of the Wuding River, Preparing to Attack Yulin</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Baoding, 4th dispatch] The National Army and the Communist Army near Baoding have been frequently mobilized recently, seemingly preparing for an offensive and defensive battle. The Communist army is gathering between Baoxi and Yujiazhuang Wangdu, and a major battle may break out again. The Communist army on the bank of the Jinhe River sneaks into the suburbs of Baoding late at night, and there are occasional small clashes. Senior generals of the Communist army in Hebei recently held a meeting in Yixian, planning to launch a spring offensive in Hebei, Chahar, and Shanxi. It is said that Mao Zedong has arrived in western Hebei, and it is also rumored that Liu Bocheng went to Lu'an to instigate Gao Shuxun to participate in the war.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 4th dispatch] According to Sun Changguan Suzong, there are 120,000 Communist troops in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, but there has been no major action recently. Communist militia have been constantly surrendering recently, and more than 10,000 people have returned in Hebei alone, which is very noteworthy. The headquarters of the Eleventh War Zone moved to Baoding to handle most of the affairs.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th dispatch] In response to the Xinhua News Agency's propaganda that the National Army's Hu Zongnan's troops are currently attacking Guanzhong in three routes, this reporter specially visited the military spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense. According to the answer: The Communist army is currently drawing six infantry regiments and more than 40,000 militiamen from Yan'an and gathering in the area west of the Wuding River, preparing to launch a large-scale attack on Yulin. The statement that the National Army is attacking Guanzhong is completely untrue and is thought to be a fabrication to cover up military actions.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 4th dispatch] The situation in the north has been uncertain in recent weeks, and the war news is constant, but the Pinghan Road is still being damaged. A section between Liulihe and Yongle was damaged by the Communist army both yesterday and the day before yesterday, and was immediately repaired. Passenger transport between Ping and Bao is still not open.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Beiping, 4th dispatch] Since the night before New Year's Day, Jicheng in southern Shanxi has been fiercely attacked by the Communist army from the east, west, and south, and the city is now heavily surrounded. Beiqu Village, north of Quwo County, has also been under attack by the Communist army since New Year's Day. In addition, four brigades of the Communist army have gathered on the periphery of Guangling in southern Shanxi, preparing to attack the city.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th dispatch] Three brigades of the Communist army and Wang Tang's troops, as well as militia brigades from various counties, totaling more than 10,000, are gradually advancing towards the north and northeast of Quwo. They are now only ten kilometers away from the city walls. More than 2,000 Communist troops who fled west from the southern foot of Ershan Mountain in the northern district of Jicheng, one part arrived at Dicun De (six kilometers northeast of Quwo), and another part arrived at Guhui Jiao (northeast of Quwo), with the potential to attack Quwo and Houma in separate ways. More than 600 Communist troops who fled from Wenxi on the 29th of last month are currently engaged in fierce fighting with our police force near Tanjiagou. The Communist army in Wuxiang recently set up an arsenal in Bangou Village, five kilometers southeast of the city, destroying the rails of the Dongqin Line and allowing them to be used as materials.</p>
<h3>Anti-Chinese Actions by Bandits Intensify; It Is Announced That Overseas Chinese Will Not Be Allowed to Enter the Country Temporarily; We Will Adopt Further Measures Against the Bandits</h3>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 4th dispatch] The Philippine government announced today that it will temporarily suspend allowing overseas Chinese to enter the country until a general treaty is concluded between China and the Philippines. The Philippine government did not explain this move, but it is heard that Philippine President Roxas strongly opposed a certain clause in the draft treaty carried by the Chinese envoy to the Philippines, which is related to this matter. However, the nature of this clause is unknown.

From now on, those who wish to enter the Philippines do not need to go through such intermediary agencies and can directly apply to the immigration bureau. However, from January to October this year, only 50 foreigners will be allowed to immigrate and reside each month.</p>
<p>[This newspaper, Nanjing, 4th dispatch] Since the first President of the independent Philippines, Roxas, took office, the anti-Chinese movement of bandits has sprung up. After the implementation of the Filipino Market Law in Manila, the Filipino Retail Law and the Filipino Labor Law were successively passed. The Filipino Retail Law was implemented on New Year's Day this year. The official protest submitted by our envoy to the Philippines, Chen Zhiping, on December 19 last year regarding this law has been completely ignored and has not received any response. It is heard that our relevant authorities, if this continues, our many overseas Chinese in the Philippines will inevitably find it difficult to make a living, and there will be no place to stand.

<h3>The Blocking and Repair Project of Huayuankou Has Been Delayed to This Day Due to the Obstruction of the Communist Army; If There Are No Accidents, It Can Be Closed Before the Spring Flood</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th dispatch] After the Yellow River burst at Huayuankou, Zheng County, in the 27th year, the floodwaters flowed south and entered the Grand Canal, flooding an area of 29,000 square kilometers and affecting more than 6 million people, resulting in an unprecedented disaster. Before and after the victory, local governments in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, as well as provincial and county public opinion organs, have petitioned for the completion of the breach sealing work as soon as possible. The central government, in order to address the suffering of the people and seek to restore production in the vast flooded area, decided to proceed with the policy of sealing the breach and restoring the embankment. The work officially started on March 1 last year, but because the Yellow River embankment is as long as more than 1,400 kilometers, two-thirds of which is under the control of the Communist army, not only is construction impossible, but even preliminary reconnaissance and surveying cannot be carried out. In order to save the more than 6 million victims in the flooded area, the government repeatedly discussed the methods of sealing the breach and restoring the embankment with the Communist army. Since the principle of implementation was agreed upon with the Communist army representatives in Beijing on May 18, the Water Conservancy Committee has proceeded in accordance with the agreement. During this period, the Communist army repeatedly obstructed and violated the agreement. The destruction of the Wangfen Stone Factory in Xinxiang, the capture of employees of the Shandong Repair and Defense Office surveying team in Jiyang, and the recent abduction of employees at the Changyuan construction site in Hebei, and the destruction of the Wangfen Stone Factory again, are all clear evidence, but the Water Conservancy Committee has always proceeded carefully in accordance with the principles of the agreement. Now, the construction of the breach-sealing piles has been completed, and the embankment protection work is being rushed, and the progress is still smooth. If there are no unexpected obstructions, it can be closed before the spring flood.</p>
<p>According to the principles of the agreement, the embankment restoration project downstream in the Communist-controlled area should be handled by the Communist army. The funds for this project have been reviewed by the Water Conservancy Committee based on the suggestions of American consultant Todd, and 8 billion yuan has been approved and allocated to UNRRA in the sixth and seventh months to be paid according to the value of the work completed. According to the consultant's inspection report, it is believed that the payments already made and the food issued by UNRRA can offset the costs of the unfinished project. As for the restoration of the embankment in the National Army's territory, the earthwork that has been completed now totals more than 3 million cubic meters, and it will also reach the completion stage. In addition, regarding the embankment restoration project in the area bordering the National Army and the Communist Army, because the staff cannot go there, the Yellow River Blocking and Embankment Restoration Project Bureau sent personnel to accompany consultant Todd and Communist Army representatives to inspect the project in order to speed up the progress. According to the report on December 25, after the members entered the Communist Army area, they were intercepted by the Communist Army five times in three days, and more than a hundred shots were fired, making it impossible to carry out the inspection mission. They stopped advancing after reaching Zhangqiuji, Shandong Province, similar planned obstructions have a serious impact on the entire Yellow River blocking and embankment restoration.</p>
<p>Regarding the relocation and relief expenses for the residents of the old riverbed of the common river under the jurisdiction of the Communist Army, because the old riverbed originally belonged to the riverbed, the people should not live there. In order to take care of people's livelihoods and ensure the smooth progress of the project, the government has approved and allocated special funds to UNRRA to host the matter in accordance with the agreed-upon methods, in order to benefit the people, and it is now actively proceeding.</p>
<h3>Sir Cripps Sends a Letter to Thank the President and His Wife</h3>

<h3>Japanese Cheap Textiles Will Seize the World Market - New York Business Week Issues Warning</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] According to Business Week magazine: with the assistance of the American military authorities, Japan's cheap textiles will quickly gain a dominant position in world markets, while China's poor economic situation makes it impossible for its domestic factories to obtain the textile trade once controlled by Japan as they hope. Business Week also stated: The American military authorities stationed in Japan are strongly advocating a rapid increase in the production of Japanese textiles to pay for the Allied occupation costs. At the same time, members of the textile industry in the British trade delegation, currently visiting various Eastern countries, have warned that Britain will block any plan to allow Japan to restore its textile market in Southeast Asia. The weekly also predicts that the prolonged instability of French-controlled Vietnam will prevent the large-scale production of rice and coal from Vietnam, which are urgently needed by various Eastern countries.</p>
<h3>The New Great Wall Beyond the Frontier (Part 1) - A Record of an Interview with General Fu Zuoyi</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>Aspiring to Serve the People's Will</p>
<p>At a rare gathering in Zhangjiakou, a foreign reporter, flushed with excitement after drinking, raised his glass to General Fu Zuoyi and offered a toast, saying, "Marshal Marshall praised you, saying that every inch of you exudes the air of a good general. It is truly an honor to witness your demeanor today." These well-chosen words of praise and blessing would presumably have earned General Fu's nod of approval. Unexpectedly, the words revealed by General Fu expressed a sense of uneasiness, and he stated: "I myself cannot see anything special about myself. I only feel that I am a rustic old country fellow, a commoner from the people. If I, Fu Zuoyi, have achieved anything, it is entirely because everything I have done has been in accordance with the will of the people. I will do whatever the people want to do, and I will never do anything that goes against the will of the people. For example, the War of Resistance Against Japan was what every citizen wanted at the time. I resisted Japan according to the wishes of the people and defeated the Japanese. Other generals who fought against Japan also defeated the Japanese invaders. Everything I am doing now is also entirely in accordance with the will of the people." These words from the bottom of his heart were fully confirmed during the reporter's short stay in Zhangjiakou.</p>
<p>The Need for Stability and Food</p>
<p>What the people need most at the moment is stability and food. What General Fu Zuoyi is currently doing in Chahar Province is to achieve these two goals. He said: "In the future, the administrative policy of Chahar Province will mainly be to stabilize public security and improve the people's lives. Chahar Province is not poor. Saying it is poor is no different from saying it is rich. If it is properly developed, it has unlimited prospects."</p>
<p>What makes him most sad is that Chahar Province has been damaged too severely. Because talking about this point leads to the future of the entire country, he is very concerned about national affairs. He repeatedly asked the reporters for their thoughts on this National Assembly. He believes that the constitution drafted by this National Assembly is the result of decades of struggle and resistance against Japan by the people of the country. The new democratic elements are very numerous. Even if the Communist Party does not endorse it, it will not have much impact, because it is impossible for the constitution to be approved by everyone. The current constitution is based on the will of the majority of the people, so it should not be affected by the opposition of a few people.</p>
<p>Hoping for Cooperation from the CCP</p>
<p>Although he holds this view of the constitution, General Fu has always hoped that the CCP can work hand in hand with the government. The group of Chinese and foreign reporters visited Zhangjiakou four times, and in each conversation, he emphasized this point. On the evening when the reporter group returned to Zhangjiakou after visiting the bloody facts in Chongli, he expressed his feelings about the tragedy in an extremely sorrowful tone, but still said: "The government hopes for peace. For the sake of the people, I also desperately hope for peace. As long as the negotiations go well, no problem is difficult to solve."</p>
<p>One reporter asked him to guess where the CCP would finally relocate to, as newspapers in Nanjing speculated that the CCP might launch another Long March, relocating its base from Yan'an to Jiamusi in the Northeast, Shanxi, or Ningxia. General Fu's reply was: "I hope they don't run away, but come and cooperate with us for the sake of the country's future. We hope to embark on the path of democratic unification." These frank and sincere words moved all the reporters present at the time. I believe that the other party will not be indifferent after hearing these words. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A New Dawn for Burmese Independence</h3>
<p>A relatively gratifying piece of news from London on New Year's Day 1947 was that U Aung San, Vice-Chairman of the Burmese Government's Executive Council, had been sent to London to attend a meeting convened by Prime Minister Attlee regarding the future of Burma. According to news from Yangon, the Burmese interim government has decided to send a delegation to London to attend talks on the future of Burma and Anglo-Burmese relations, with U Aung San, Vice-Chairman of the Executive Council, as the head of the delegation, which will leave Burma for England on January 1st. On the eve of his departure, U Aung San delivered a speech to 40,000 people attending the mass meeting in Yangon, urging the Burmese people to make a final struggle to prepare to achieve their goals, and specifically pointed out, "Revolution is not the true will of Burma." U Aung San also said: "At this moment, it is impossible to predict the success of the Anglo-Burmese talks in London; perhaps we can get what we want, but if we cannot get what we want, then we must be prepared for decisive action." Now that U Aung San is on his way to England, regardless of the outcome of the Anglo-Burmese talks, the very fact that this meeting can be convened is gratifying; especially as we see this good news coming in the New Year.</p>
<p>Why is this news good news? It indicates that a ruling nation and a ruled nation are willing to resolve all issues regarding the adjustment of their future relations through negotiation. It indicates that a ruling nation is willing to change its position in a peaceful manner in order to satisfy the aspirations of the ruled nation, and at the same time, it also indicates that a ruled nation is willing to fulfill their aspirations in a peaceful manner. The convening of these Anglo-Burmese talks is itself a manifestation of the spirit of cooperation and is worthy of our praise. We cannot help but praise Prime Minister Attlee's enlightened policy and the legitimate path taken by the Burmese leaders in achieving their national aspirations. At a time when the situation in the Far East is still turbulent and the national movements of various ruled nations are gathering momentum, the imminent convening of the Anglo-Burmese talks has a demonstrative effect on determining the future of various ruled nations in the Far East. We believe that since both the British and Burmese sides have the desire to resolve the Burmese situation peacefully, the Anglo-Burmese talks to be held in London will definitely be successful.</p>
<p>The convening of these Anglo-Burmese talks was initially announced by Prime Minister Attlee in Parliament on December 20th and scheduled to be held in London from January 3rd. The announcement of the convening of this meeting came just after the Indian representatives had gathered in London to discuss the constitution, which immediately aroused sharp criticism from the Conservative Party and its leader Churchill, who believed that the establishment of the British Empire was the result of centuries of hard work by the British people, and should not be accelerated the destruction of it by the Labor government. However, Churchill's roaring lion could not shake the Labor government's decision; judging from the facts, the British government had no other way to go except to help India and Burma gain independence and autonomy. Churchill was engaged in the war to establish the British Empire in South Africa and witnessed the decline of the empire, so he could not help but have many feelings. However, for the sake of Britain's own interests, it is not necessarily beneficial to its own country to rule over a nation that is unwilling to be ruled, and on the contrary, it will inevitably be a burden. Therefore, the Attlee government's adoption of an enlightened policy at this moment, allowing the people of India and Burma to fulfill their aspirations, is indeed a wise decision, which is also beneficial to Britain itself. The British Empire has gone through many historical stages; from a prisoner colony to the highly autonomous "dominion" of today, which is virtually independent. There have been many changes in the meantime. If the British Empire has strength, this strength is not produced by the severity of the rule, but by the abandonment of the rule. This can be seen from how Canada, Australia, and other places are loyal to the empire, and how Britain itself has gained their new support by abandoning its rule over them.</p>
<p>Since Burma fell under British rule, due to the ignorance of the British-Indian authorities at the time, the rule of Burma was assigned to the Indian government in New Delhi, which caused Burma to become a colony of a colony, and all aspects of Burmese society and economy were covered with a very strong Indian color. This is a very unnatural development in Burma. Although India and Burma are geographically connected, the people of India and the people of Burma have differences not only in race and language but also in history and culture. As early as before the outbreak of the Pacific War, the British government decided to separate India and Burma and prepared to grant Burma the status of a "dominion." Unfortunately, the war broke out suddenly, and the Burmese situation has not been resolved to this day. Now that the British government has convened Anglo-Burmese talks, and U Aung San said on the occasion of leaving Burma for England that "revolution is not the true will of Burma," then the convening of these Anglo-Burmese talks may be able to satisfy the aspirations of the Burmese people.</p>
<p>Here, what we cannot help but think of is the situation in Vietnam. Since armed struggles have broken out in the Hanoi and Tonkin areas, the French government has adopted a tough policy in handling the Vietnam issue. As recently as the 2nd of this month, according to a report from Paris by the Associated Press, a French government spokesperson refuted the peace proposals made by Ho Chi Minh, President of the Republic of Vietnam, saying that it was impossible to negotiate under the current circumstances. It can be seen that the French government still believes that a high-pressure policy can quell everything. This truly shows the face of the past imperialism; it is really regrettable. With the new development of the Burmese situation, we hope that the French authorities can also adopt a more enlightened policy in handling the Vietnamese situation so that the Vietnamese situation can tend to stability. This is not insignificant in relation to the maintenance of peace and stability in the Far East. The Blum government, which prides itself on progress, should no longer have the remnants of imperialism.</p>

It is also stipulated that after a certain number of years, it will be returned to provincial management. This plan has been agreed to by the Henan Provincial Government, and it can be implemented as soon as it is approved by the CRRRA and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Third-Party Reporting of Traitors - The Jiangsu High Court Has Received Telegram Orders - Cases Accepted Before the Deadline Will Still Be Prosecuted According to Law - Cases Eligible for Amnesty Are Being Sorted Out</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Suzhou 4th] Various parties are paying close attention to the deadline for third-party reporting of traitors. It was previously rumored that the deadline would be December 31, 1946, but because the judicial authorities had not received orders, it was difficult to confirm. Recently, the Suzhou High Court received a telegram order from the Ministry of Justice at 6:25 pm on the 4th, which stated: After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, large and small traitors have been arrested one after another. Among them, there are also many who have made false accusations due to revenge. In order to maintain judicial dignity and eliminate such arbitrary reports, it has been decided after a meeting that all cases of third-party reporting of traitors after December 31, 1946, will not be accepted. You are hereby ordered to instruct your subordinates to comply accordingly. This newspaper reporter specially visited Chief Prosecutor Han Xun of the Suzhou High Prosecutor's Office at night to inquire about this matter. He was informed: Traitor cases that have been accepted and are being handled by third parties before December 31, 1946, will still be prosecuted according to law. However, in the future, all cases where a non-victim brings evidence to court to sue should be rejected. As for the promulgation of the Amnesty Ordinance, this office has only seen it in the newspapers and has not yet received an order. However, this court is now sorting out cases that are eligible for amnesty, and it can be implemented as soon as the central government issues a clear order.</p>

This is the first time that Fuzhou has escorted overseas Chinese for repatriation.</p>
<h3>Hundreds of Traitors Reported in Su County the Day Before New Year's Eve</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Su County] This county has been occupied by the enemy for many years, and there are many who have collaborated with the enemy. Although the government has arrested and sent them for trial, the number is only a fraction of the total. In order to promote righteousness and thoroughly eliminate traitors, the county party headquarters, the Youth League, the Provisional Council, the Education Association, the County Farmers' Association, the County Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Women's Association, and other legal groups held a joint meeting on the day before New Year's Eve for reporting.

Local people were very happy.</p>
<h3>Traitors in Hai'ning Slip Through the Net - The High Court Issues a Clear Arrest Warrant</h3>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Will Actively Conduct This Year - Provincial Household Survey - Train 20,000 Household Policy Personnel to Conduct Registration Strictly - Bureau Chief Pi and Director Sun Come to Shanghai to Appeal for Construction Funds</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Hangzhou] In order to implement the provisions of the new household registration law, Zhejiang Province will conduct a provincial household survey this year. The existing household registration books will be checked and corrected separately. The townships and towns will train household administration personnel. It is planned to train 3,100 people at the township level and 18,000 people at the Bao level. Household registration, identity registration, migration registration, and floating population registration will be strictly handled, and national identity cards will be issued universally. The required funds are 3.3 billion yuan. The household administration funds of various counties and cities can only allocate 200 million yuan, a shortfall of 3.1 billion yuan. It will follow the regulations of the Executive Yuan and request the central government to allocate funds.</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Hangzhou 4th] Because of financial difficulties in Zhejiang Province, major construction plans cannot be carried out. Last year, construction work relied entirely on the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's relief flour and national compulsory labor. Small-scale water conservancy projects and highway roadbed construction were able to proceed smoothly. This year, most of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) supplies transported to China are industrial machinery, and it is difficult to allocate the work-relief flour that Zhejiang Province originally approved. Panic has arisen everywhere, and construction is bound to be hindered. Therefore, the Construction Bureau should convene relevant personnel to discuss and determine the minimum amount, and Bureau Chief Pi and Zhejiang Branch Director Sun will go to Shanghai tomorrow to appeal in order to save the construction of Zhejiang Province.</p>

<h3>Changzhou-Danyang Joint Defense Zone - Three Command Posts Established</h3>
<p>Complete the Suppression by the End of January</p>
<p>[Our newspaper Wujin] The Changzhou-Danyang Joint Defense Headquarters of the Capital Garrison Command has established three command posts in Wujin, Danbei, and Yangzhou to conduct suppression operations. The first phase of the suppression deadline has passed, and the second phase of suppression work has begun. Most of the remaining bandits in the jurisdiction have been defeated or have disappeared without a trace. However, there are still a few scattered bandits who occasionally harass the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th districts of this county (southeastern area), and the Wusha Islands in Yangzhou and the northern areas of Danyang. They appear and disappear from time to time, intending to seize the opportunity to make trouble. In order to thoroughly suppress and ensure peace, the headquarters will divide the original deployment into three command posts in Wujin, Danbei, and Yangzhou to command separately. A suppression plan has been specially ordered to be followed by the three county governments and to complete the task by the end of January 1947.</p>
<h3>Local Budgets of 26 Counties South of the Yangtze River - Approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government - Meetings Will Still Be Convened First in Counties North of the Yangtze River for Review</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Zhenjiang] The local general budgets of the counties and cities of Jiangsu Province for the year 1947 were previously compiled and sent to the province. However, much of the content was inconsistent with the facts. The provincial government separately convened county chiefs, accounting directors, and finance section chiefs from the counties south of the Yangtze River to the province for review. The Accounting Office invited various departments, bureaus, and relevant agencies to jointly review the original budgets submitted by the counties and the review results. After comprehensive review and compilation, it is now known that the local general budgets for 1947 of the various counties have been approved by the provincial government committee. These include Shanghai, Nanhui, Chuansha, Kunshan, Fengxian, Songjiang, Jiangning, Danyang, Jurong, Jintan, Lishui, Gaochun, Liyang, Yixing, Wuxi, Wujin, Wuxian, Jiangyin, Changshu, Taicang, Wujiang, Qingpu, Jinshan, Baoshan, Jiading, and Chongming, a total of 26 counties. Except for Zhenjiang, which is still under review, the budgets for 1947 of all counties south of the Yangtze River have been established. The provincial government has now ordered them to be issued to the county governments for compliance and has also sent them to the central authorities for filing. As for the budgets of the counties north of the Yangtze River, preparations are also underway to convene a meeting on a regular basis for review.</p>

<h3>Conflict Also Occurs in Qingpu Amidst the Celebration of New Year's Day - Security Team and Self-Defense Team Open Fire and Shoot at Each Other - People at the Shuangtong Congress Are Terrified</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Qingpu] At 8:00 am on New Year's Day, all sectors of the county held a grand celebration of the success of the constitution and the opening of the 36th anniversary of the founding of the country in the stadium. A review of the armed teams throughout the county was also held. The ceremony was grand. At 11:00 am, a soldier from the security team suddenly beat a member of the self-defense team in the Eighth District. The two sides gathered crowds to argue. After a disagreement, they even fought each other, both firing live ammunition. Gunshots rang out, and buglers blew their horns and machine guns swept, as if facing a formidable enemy. Order was suddenly disrupted and out of control. More than 8,000 people attending the congress were shocked and frightened by the sudden change and fled in panic. The "war" situation lasted for about a quarter of an hour. After being informed, the presidium of the congress arrived at the scene to mediate and strictly ordered to stop shooting and investigate the soldiers who caused the incident and punish them severely. The situation was not expanded. However, all the people attending the congress were terrified. Fortunately, no one was killed in the conflict, and only three people at the scene were injured by stray bullets.

<h3>Details of the Changshu Conflict</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Changshu Dispatch] On New Year's Day at 9:00 AM, people from all walks of life gathered at the Shimei Public Sports Field to hold a celebration rally. A conflict arose due to a misunderstanding involving the veterans (i.e., wounded soldiers) and the county's security brigade at the field, leading to an unfortunate incident. Dozens were killed or injured, making it an unprecedented bloody tragedy.

At this moment, someone threw a hand grenade, causing a loud explosion, and gunfire also erupted. The order was disrupted, and people scattered and fled in all directions, shocking the entire city. Some shops closed their doors one after another. As a result, two Type 38 rifles from the county security brigade were seized, and six veterans, including Cai Fulin, were killed. Many people on both sides were injured. After the incident, rumors spread, and people were alarmed. The garrison and self-defense forces were dispatched to maintain public order. The Changshu authorities sent telegrams to the Ministry of National Defense, the Rear Service Command, the Provincial Government, the Provincial Security Command, and the Second District Commissioner's Office, requesting the dispatch of senior officials to investigate. In addition, Brigade Commander Ling of the garrison, fearing responsibility, convened an emergency meeting at the Political Department at 3:00 PM on the same day, gathering heads of various agencies and representatives of legal entities to discuss the aftermath. A unanimous decision was made to provide generous coffins and funeral expenses for the deceased and offer condolences to the injured by people from all walks of life. An investigation committee was also formed to clarify responsibilities. During the investigation period, the garrison brigade would be responsible for maintaining public order. The meeting lasted for five hours and adjourned at 8:00 PM in the evening. At 11:00 AM on the 2nd, Deputy Commander Xia of the district security arrived first to investigate. In the afternoon, representatives from all walks of life went to various rear hospitals to comfort the veterans. The county security brigade was immediately transferred to rural areas. By the 3rd, everything had returned to normal.</p>
<h3>Zhang Tianshi Arrives in Kunshan to Resolve Disputes Among Daoist Friends</h3>

He also visited County Magistrate Shen at the county government for a pleasant conversation. Zhang left Kunshan after staying for two days.</p>
<h3>Jinhua Rice Prices Skyrocket, Like a Mad Rush for All Goods</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinhua Dispatch] Rice prices in this county have recently begun to rise sharply. It is said that some unscrupulous merchants entrusted rice shops to purchase and transport rice in large quantities for export, resulting in supply falling short of demand, and prices rising again and again, soaring upwards. Not long ago, it had not broken the 30,000 yuan mark, but now it has jumped to 34,000 yuan per dan. Ordinary citizens and low-income people are all crying out in hardship.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Rugao Dispatch] The recent skyrocketing gold prices in various places, including Beijing and Shanghai, have triggered a sharp rise in commodity prices in the inland areas. In Rugao, kerosene prices have increased more than tenfold in recent days, foreign goods have increased by 40% to 50%, and fabrics and general merchandise have increased by 30% to 40% and 50% to 60%. Although the Shanghai gold price has fallen recently, merchants are using transportation difficulties as an excuse to continue raising prices on all incoming goods. In these difficult end-of-year times, the lives of ordinary people are greatly affected.</p>
<h3>Luo Zhuoying Visits Luodian to Commemorate War Relics</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Luodian Dispatch] Guangdong Province Chairman Luo Zhuoying, accompanied by Liu Wei, Commander of the Southeast District of the Military Police; Li Jiamian, representative of the Guangdong Provincial Government stationed in Nanjing; Liu Shizan, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Office of the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications; and Liu Zhiguo, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Material Storage and Transfer Office of the Ministry of Communications, arrived in Luodian on the morning of New Year's Day. During the Shanghai Battle against Japan, Luo fought fiercely against the enemy in Luodian Xipu Huatang. He personally planned and defended the area for more than three months, with heavy casualties among the soldiers. Moreover, a certain division commander also died heroically here. Luo's visit to Luodian this time was to commemorate the war relics and, to permanently commemorate the martyred soldiers, plan to establish a memorial park in Luodian. Accompanied by Jin, the head of Luodian Township, and others, he inspected the site and planned to entrust the local construction agency to design it. At noon, he left Luodian, went around Jiading, and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Disguised Levies in the Recovered Areas of Northern Jiangsu, Smooth Transportation from Nantong to Dongtai Yancheng</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Dispatch on the 4th] According to reports: Although the recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu are said to be exempt from taxes, the counties are short of funds due to the initial stage of restoration, and the expenses are huge. It is still inevitable that there will be incidents of forced levies, causing many wealthy shops that fled to Jiangnan to remain hesitant and unwilling to return home and resume business. The authorities believe that this matter greatly affects the entire industrial and commercial sector and the rural economy of Northern Jiangsu. They have sent personnel to secretly investigate in various counties and strictly prohibit disguised levies.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Dispatch on the 4th] After the recovery of the salt-producing areas, the Tongyu Highway has continued to extend northward by more than 100 kilometers from Dongtai under the joint efforts of the national army's engineering corps and the local government. Currently, passenger and freight transportation from Nantong to Dongtai Yancheng is smooth, and water transportation between Yandong has also been restored. It takes only one day to reach Yancheng from Tai, which is very convenient for those returning home. However, the rural areas of Yancheng and Huai'an have suffered the most damage, and winter cultivation has been delayed by half, requiring urgent relief.</p>

<h3>First Meeting of the New US Congress, Martin Elected Speaker of the House, Calls for Bipartisan Cooperation to Solve Various Problems, Senator Bilbo's Bribery Becomes the Target of Public Criticism</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Washington Dispatch on the 3rd] The 80th US Congress officially opened today, with sessions in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Members were sworn in and vowed to handle national affairs in accordance with the US Constitution for the next two years. The venue was divided into two rooms, with more than a thousand spectators. The opening of Congress began with a prayer ceremony, followed by speeches by various members and the introduction of many proposals, which will be the subject of investigation and heated debate in the coming months. After the formal ceremony, both houses will hear President Truman's year-end State of the Union address. However, the biggest performance in American politics is the issue of Senator Bilbo's retention in the Senate, which is the biggest issue raised in the Senate on the opening day of Congress, overshadowing all other important issues. The visitor seats and diplomatic staff seats were all full, and their attention was focused on Bilbo rather than the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Dispatch on the 3rd] The 80th US Congress opened today, and the Republican Party, after fifteen years in the wilderness, regained control of the House of Representatives amidst shouts. Martin was elected Speaker, and a 20% reduction in income tax was proposed as the first bill. A commotion broke out in the Senate when Missouri Democratic Senator Bilbo was sworn in. As Bilbo was approaching the podium to be sworn in, he was blocked by Idaho Democratic Senator Taylor and returned to his seat. Taylor proposed not to recognize Bilbo's qualification as a senator, saying that his certificate was stained with fraud. Democratic senators from the southern states stood up to defend Bilbo, and Louisiana Democratic Senator Overton proposed to allow Bilbo to be sworn in, leading to a fierce debate. In the afternoon, Ohio Republican Senator Taft proposed to dismiss the motion against Bilbo, which passed by a vote of 38 to 20. The new Republican senators were then sworn in, while Bilbo must be sworn in after his certificate is reviewed by the Senate Rules Committee.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington Dispatch on the 4th] Republican senators have issued an ultimatum to the Democratic minority, saying that if Democratic senators continue to obstruct the expulsion of Senator Bilbo from the Senate, they will amend the Senate's rules of procedure.

At that time, two major Republican senators, Taft and Morse, said that the debate was lengthy and impatient, and the majority party would have to amend the rules of procedure.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse Washington Dispatch on the 3rd] US House Speaker Martin said in his inaugural address that the government should immediately stop interfering in the private affairs of the people, and the system of the people supervising the government should be restored immediately. The current American system has made the United States the greatest country in history, and there is no room for a system that accommodates communism in the US government. In short, the government should reduce spending, and the Republican and Democratic parties should work together, he said. When Speaker Martin spoke, applause was continuous, and the anti-Roosevelt and anti-communist sentiment in the US House of Representatives can also be seen here.</p>
<h3>Two Parties Launch Public Campaign to Amend Labor Law</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Washington Dispatch on the 3rd] Members of Congress from both major US parties today launched a public campaign to prevent strikes that affect public health or safety, such as coal mine strikes. However, this campaign will face strong opposition, and labor groups and large industrial circles will strongly oppose any proposals to force the resolution of labor disputes without allowing strikes or lockouts. Democratic Congressman Smith has proposed a certain labor bill, saying that public interests must be valued, and it would be wrong to pay too much attention to the special wishes of labor or industry. Smith's bill stipulates that in the event of labor disputes in various most important industries, compulsory arbitration should be enforced, prohibiting store closures and collective bargaining for the entire industry. Five Republican members have proposed another method, stipulating that compulsory arbitration should be implemented in industries that affect public health and safety. According to Massachusetts Representative Herde, we firmly believe in the necessity of this bill, and otherwise, it will be impossible to protect public interests. Compulsory arbitration is to resolve the dispute between the two parties by a third party. Michigan Republican Senator Ferguson has drafted a bill that will directly resolve labor disputes through the labor court, believing that the proposal for compulsory arbitration has less chance of passing, and it is easier to pass a bill that only restricts labor unions in various ways without depriving them of the right to strike. Congress will amend the labor law in some way within three months, which is practically certain, but whether strikes will be prohibited is another matter.</p>

I and you both have the same idea, that if you defeat us by force, even if you win, you will tarnish your dignity. We still have the opportunity to achieve a just peace.

<p>[Central News Agency New Delhi Dispatch on the 3rd] Gandhi has begun his journey from village to village, and today he traveled to the Noakhali area in eastern Bengal Province.

Japanese newspaper reports say that Prime Minister Yoshida believes that making non-government party personnel leave their posts to strengthen the cabinet will not help improve the current changing economic situation. He believes that inviting opposition parties to form a coalition government is the only solution, because the Social Democratic Party may exert great influence over agitated workers.</p>

<h3>An Old Man in the Soviet Union Accumulates Huge Wealth Through Begging</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Moscow Dispatch on the 4th] Today's newspaper reported that Vasilyev, a 71-year-old Moscow beggar, has accumulated private wealth of 260,000 rubles after begging on the streets for many years. The old beggar was originally a monk and begged in Moscow's Belokov Square, arousing suspicion, so an investigation was launched. It was learned that he was a farmer in a collective farm near Vologda City from 1930 to 1940. Dissatisfied with the status quo, he sneaked to Moscow to beg and was only discovered now.</p>
<h3>Scenery of Delhi, the Capital of India</h3>
<p>Delhi is the capital of India, and everyone who has been there feels that there are particularly many bicycles, making it one of the best in the Far East. During commuting hours, the streets are filled with bicycles, and the riders are all dressed in white, creating a unique scene. In fact, Delhi is two cities: New Delhi and Old Delhi, separated by five miles, but there is no clear boundary between them, so a newcomer has no way of knowing whether they are in the new city or the old city. The total population of the two areas is approaching one million.</p>
<p>Returning to Normal</p>
<p>All the wartime military activities have vanished with the end of the war. Delhi was originally the headquarters of the U.S. China-Burma-India Theater, where U.S. troops were gathered. Now, some have returned home, and others have been transferred. General Stilwell's headquarters was once located there, but he did not stay there often, preferring to live in Chongqing, where the climate was cooler, or in the tents of the northern Burmese jungle. Today, only 50 U.S. military personnel remain in Delhi, responsible for handling the remaining U.S. military supplies.</p>
<p>Many white, single-story houses in the city center, which used to serve as U.S. military headquarters, have now been converted into offices for the British military and civil government. The "Curzon" barracks, once famous during the war, where many American soldiers sweated profusely and spent several years, has now been converted into the meeting place of the Indian Constituent Assembly.</p>
<p>Since the end of the war, prices in some parts of India have fallen, but Delhi is an exception. The cost of living has not only remained high but has continued to rise.</p>
<p>Juma Masjid Mosque</p>
<p>Among the many attractions in Delhi, one of the most attractive to tourists is the "Red Fort." The fort was built in the 15th century, and the world-famous golden throne of the Peacock Dynasty was once located there. Behind the throne were two peacocks, with tails inlaid with diamonds, rubies, sapphires... a display of extreme luxury and splendor. Another building of particular interest is the "Juma Masjid" (Pearl Mosque), also a relic of the 15th century, and highly regarded in the Muslim world.</p>
<p>New Delhi, however, was created by the British. The architectural style is modern European. The Governor-General Wavell governs four million people of India there. In general, the Indian people recognize him as a good Governor-General and hope that he will be the last Governor-General. The government buildings are magnificent and grand, full of Indian color. The only regret is that around these huge buildings are gathered thousands of poor people struggling on the verge of starvation.</p>
<p>Brown and Healthy</p>
<p>India is located near the equator, with strong sunlight. Therefore, white skin often becomes covered with a layer of oily tan. In Europe, women consider tanned skin fashionable, believing it to be a sign of health and beauty. But in India, no one likes this color. Women always wrap themselves tightly when going out to protect themselves from the sun. Is this due to the geographical environment? Or is it due to the contempt for people of color?</p>

<h3>Conveners of All Levels of the Senate Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday to Decide the Agenda; The General Assembly Will Open Tomorrow Morning; Fifty-Eight Proposals Received by Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The conveners of all committees of the Municipal Senate held their third joint meeting at the Senate at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the agenda of the second general assembly and to draw lots for the seating arrangements of the senators. The meeting was presided over by Speaker Pan Gongzhan, and a total of 26 senators attended. The agenda of the general assembly was decided as follows:</p>
<p>January 6th, 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM: Commemorative Week and opening ceremony. 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM: First meeting, after the Mayor's policy report, senators will raise questions.</p>
<p>January 7th, 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM: Second meeting, questions will be raised to the four bureaus of Police, Health, Social Affairs, and Education.</p>
<p>January 8th, 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM: Third meeting, questions will be raised regarding the four bureaus of Finance, Land Administration, Public Utilities, and Public Works.</p>
<p>January 9th, morning and afternoon: First and second subcommittee review meetings to review the reports and proposals of each bureau. The time and location are not fixed, and each committee will decide on its own, and report at the general assembly on the previous day.</p>
<p>January 10th, 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM: Fourth meeting, discussion of proposals.</p>
<p>January 11th, afternoon: Fifth meeting, discussion of proposals.</p>
<p>January 12th, afternoon: Sixth meeting, discussion of the Municipal Government's policy plan for the 36th year.</p>
<p>January 13th, 9:00 AM to 9:30 AM: Commemorative Week. 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM: Seventh meeting, discussion of the Municipal General Budget for the 36th year. 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM: Closing ceremony.</p>
<p>When the Second General Assembly of the Senate holds its opening ceremony, Chinese and foreign guests will be invited to attend and observe.</p>
<p>Seating Arrangements of Senators Have Been Decided by Drawing Lots</p>
<p>Regarding the seating arrangements of the senators, Lu Shidao, Tong Xingbai, and Shen Dingsan were publicly elected at the joint meeting yesterday to draw lots to decide. The joint meeting also discussed the handling of proposals. As of yesterday, the Senate had received a total of 58 proposals. It was decided that the deadline for collecting proposals for the General Assembly would be the 5th of this month, and any proposals received after the 6th would be treated as temporary motions. At the same time, the opinion of Senator Wang Weisui was adopted, that each committee, when reviewing reports or proposals, should prepare a general report, and divide the proposals into the most important, secondary, urgent, and delayed matters, and then submit them to the General Assembly for discussion, to save the General Assembly's time. In addition, Senator Tang Shichang proposed that the review of proposals should no longer conclude with "consideration for handling," but should put forward specific measures for the municipal government authorities, otherwise, the municipal government could formulate its own regulations for handling, which would be completely different from the decisions of the General Assembly, losing the spirit of the General Assembly, just as the authorities' handling of restrictions on electricity and cremation were quite unfair.</p>
<p>The Municipal Budget for This Year Is Considered Too Large</p>
<p>During the meeting, Senator Fei Shusheng expressed his opinion on the municipal government's budget for the 36th year, believing that the budget amount was too large and unreasonable. Compared with Nanjing, Nanjing's budget for this year is only over 200 million yuan. The ratio of the population and area of Nanjing to Shanghai is 1:4, while the ratio of Shanghai's budget is 1:10. Therefore, it is hoped that the municipal government's administrative expenses should be reduced as much as possible, and the number of reviewers and their need should be requested. Speaker Pan immediately reported on the joint meeting of the Finance and Budget Committees, believing that it was necessary to give careful consideration to the municipal government's budget for the 36th year. The Finance and Budget Committees are scheduled to hold another meeting today to study this issue. Regarding the municipal government's subscription to policy regulations, the municipal government will be notified to pay attention. In the future, they must be reviewed by the Senate before they can be announced and implemented.</p>
<h3>Propose to Stipulate Principles for Policy Implementation and Revision of Regulations</h3>
<p>Senator Pang Jingzhou also put forward a temporary motion, saying that the general public believes that the Municipal Senate is close to the Municipal Government and does not represent public opinion, which is regrettable. The Municipal Senate must clearly understand its responsibilities in the future, serve the citizens, and sympathize with the citizens. Therefore, it is proposed to stipulate the basic principles of the city's recent municipal measures and revised regulations as the scope of discussion for this session of the General Assembly and to live up to the expectations of the people. The methods are roughly divided into: A. Matters related to municipal administration and reform: (1) Those that have a direct relationship with the interests and livelihoods of the people should be discussed first. (2) The construction of beautifying the city and pursuing the standards of European and American metropolises should not be discussed. (3) Emergency projects that must be started immediately should be specially studied. (4) The municipal government's budget should underestimate the people's ability to pay taxes, and the procedures should be simplified. B. The spirit of revising general regulations: (1) The original regulations that are effective should not be changed too much. (2) The method of execution should intend to avoid severity. (3) Single control orders and police regulations should be mainly persuasive. It was decided that item A in the method should be adopted by the Budget Committee, and item B should be adopted by the Regulations Committee.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Vendors on Yangzhou Road Petition, Requesting Permission to Delay Relocation Slightly</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The vegetable vendors on Yangzhou Road in this city, because the Yulin Road Police Station ordered them to relocate and concentrate their business on Xuchang Road, which is located in a remote area and affects their livelihood during the year, specially sent representatives Wang Jinyun and others to the Municipal Senate at 4:30 PM yesterday to petition, requesting an extension until after the end of the lunar year before relocation. Senator Cui Yongxiang received them and reported to the joint meeting for discussion. It was approved that the vegetable vendors' request be granted, and a letter was sent to the Police Station to allow the postponement until the end of the year before relocation.</p>
<h3>Tiered Collection of Banquet Tax, Restaurant Industry Expresses Opposition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Wine and Vegetable Commercial Guild and the responsible persons of 520 Chinese and Western restaurants in the city, in order to support the central government's revised and promulgated new law on banquet and entertainment taxes and oppose Mayor Wu's proposal to the Municipal Senate to collect banquet taxes according to the business equipment of restaurants, classified into A and B levels, issued an urgent notice yesterday, stating that the various restaurant guilds in the city will gather at 8:00 AM on the 6th of this month and prepare to go to the Municipal Senate at 9:00 AM on the morning of that day to petition all senators during the second session of the General Assembly.</p>
<h3>Private Hospitals in This City Appeal for Exemption from Taxes</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Government of this city levying business tax and income tax on hospitals in Shanghai, the private hospitals in this city believe that after the victory, the population of Shanghai has increased sharply, and the number of patients is increasing daily. Hospitals are inherently charitable and provide relief, and the fees are extremely low. Poor patients are treated free of charge, resulting in unusually difficult funding. Therefore, the Shanghai Hospital Federation stated the reasons and submitted them to the Executive and Legislative Branches, the Ministry of Finance, and the Department of Health, appealing for exemption.</p>
<h3>The Process of Wang Renshan's Surrender Reported to the Ministry of National Defense</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Renshan, the chief culprit in the explosion case of the Jiangwan Ordnance Medical Team in the First Supply Region of the Logistics Command and the director of the branch depot, surrendered himself late at night on New Year's Day.

It is reported that the Shanghai East Investigation Office of the Garrison Command, which assisted in the investigation, will investigate and verify the facts based on Wang Renshan's confession. The First Supply Region Command has reported Wang's surrender to the Ministry of National Defense, and will send him to Nanjing for investigation if necessary. The full conclusion of the case is still pending the return of the two missing warehouse managers, Wu Rulian and Chen Hanwen.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Airmail Can Arrive in One Week</h3>
<p>According to post office news: Mail to the United Kingdom is now transported by China National Aviation Corporation planes from Shanghai to Calcutta, and then transferred to British Overseas Airways to London. China National Aviation Corporation has two flights a week, and British planes have eight flights a week, so airmail from Shanghai to London takes only five to seven days, which is extremely fast. In addition to carrying airmail to various parts of the United Kingdom, this airmail service can also carry mail to other European countries, including the Soviet Union, to London and then forward it to various countries. However, it is necessary to affix sufficient airmail postage to the United Kingdom (currently 650 yuan in national currency per five grams). In addition, for airmail to the Soviet Union, if the sender still wishes to send it to the Ha'a Line (Hami to Almaty in the Soviet Union) as before, they can indicate (By Hami—Alma Ata Air Line) on the envelope, and the post office can also do so.</p>

<p>In the case of the fisherman's mate Rogers stabbing the pedicab driver Cheng Rongfang, the perpetrator Rogers was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation by the Tilanqiao Police Station at 2:00 PM on the 3rd.

They went in and out together, and their affection exceeded the norm, eventually leading to intimacy. On July 11th last autumn, Wang took Meiling to Pudong to live together for several months until December 27th, when they returned to Shanghai together, accompanying Meiling to her brother Qilin's home, and explaining that they were in love with each other and willing to fulfill their lifelong commitment. Qilin then sent Meiling to her mother, Chen Li's, home for one night, and then her mother accompanied Meiling to her cousin Lu Xiuyue's home at No. 51, Meifang Lane, Changshou Road, for a short stay, and entrusted her to persuade Meiling to sever her relationship with Qiuliang. However, Meiling was passionately in love and suddenly escaped on the evening of New Year's Day, taking refuge with her close friend on Macau Road. Later, her mother, Li, found out and thought she had been seduced again, and went to Qiuliang's house to make a scene, and grabbed and beat his mother, causing both parties to be taken to the Jiangning Branch, and the bureau summoned both the male and female protagonists to the case.

<h3>Coal Price Review Meeting Resolves That Retail Sales of Coal Balls by Each Coal Ball Factory Shall Be Subject to Supervision and Inspection; Coal Cinder Delivered Can Only Be Used to Manufacture Coal Balls</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Coal Price Review Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon at the Bureau of Social Affairs and resolved the following important issues: (1) The principle of coal ball allocation and the allocation ratio. It was resolved that: 1. If each coal ball factory has a retail department that operates retail sales, its retail business shall be subject to the supervision and inspection of the Review Committee, and the joint office of retail representatives may be entrusted by the Review Committee to assist in handling. 2. The transactions of the retail business of each factory's retail department shall not be in units of tons, otherwise, the right to retail sales will be canceled. 3. The wholesale volume of each factory's wholesale business shall be more than one ton. 4. The coal ball distribution ratio is 35% for Guohua due to special circumstances, and 20% for the rest. The above standards will be tried once, and if each party believes that adjustments are necessary, it will be submitted to the Review Committee for discussion. (2) The coal ball retailers' distribution method will be formulated by the joint office of retailers and submitted to the Review Committee for discussion. The retail portion of each factory should also follow this distribution method. (3) The coal balls manufactured by each factory through self-mining and self-transportation, in addition to the cost price being negotiated separately, retailers also have the right to enjoy the proportional distribution and sales determined this time. (4) Supervision methods for the production of coal ball raw materials: 1. After the coal cinder allocated to each factory by the Fuel Management Committee is transported to the factory, it should be reported to this Committee immediately for verification. This coal cinder is only for the manufacture of coal balls and shall not be transported out of the factory. All of these shall be supervised by this Committee. If there is any violation, it will be submitted to the meeting for handling. 2. Each time the white coal cinder is received from the Fuel Management Committee, this Committee will send personnel to the factory to extract coal samples for testing to determine the standard of B.T.U. (the heat unit of coal). 3. Each time coal balls are made, it should be reported to this Committee, and this Committee will send personnel to the factory to extract samples and send them to the Fuel Management Committee laboratory for testing. If the B.T.U. of the coal balls is exactly half of the tested coal sample, it meets the standard. Those that do not meet the standard will be submitted to the meeting for handling. 4. After each factory receives coal and manufactures coal balls, it should report the quantity manufactured to this Committee for review.</p>
<h3>Cultural Merchant Detained for Raping Friend's Daughter</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Yixin, a Jin Hua native, is forty years old and runs Kongshan Bookstore at No. 719 Beijing West Road. In August of the year before last, because his family had many children and no one to take care of them, he discussed it with his friend Xie Youde (from Changshu, living at No. 32, Hongfuxing, Xinza Road), requesting his daughter Yilin (16 years old, studying at Dajiang Middle School on Xinzha Road) to stay at his home to take care of chores and look after the children. At that time, Xie had no suspicions and readily agreed. Until March of last spring, when Li's wife returned to her hometown in Jinhua, Li raped the girl at midnight, and then repeatedly thereafter. Unexpectedly, a month later, her mother, Han, found out and called her daughter home, and interrogated her harshly. The girl then revealed the truth. After several negotiations with Li, Li hired Xu Fubao, a peddler, to mediate, willing to pay 2 million legal currency to settle the matter, and made a written statement as proof. However, after delaying for a long time, he never paid it. On New Year's Day, her mother led her daughter to Hongren Hospital, where it was confirmed that her hymen had been broken. The hospital then reported to the Xincheng Branch, which sent police to rush to the scene and brought the two to the branch for interrogation, and then sent them to the judicial authorities for verification.</p>
<h3>Schools Held Classes as Usual Yesterday, Only a Few Students from Jiaotong University and Other Schools Continued to Publicize in the Streets; The Student Self-Government Association of Datong University Issued a Solemn Statement</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The student community in this city has expressed indignation at the incident of American soldiers in Beiping insulting female university students. A few days ago, various university student unions issued declarations one after another to express their protest and urge the government to file a protest and demand punishment for the perpetrator. At the same time, because this matter is purely a legal case, it should be resolved through proper diplomatic channels. Therefore, it does not advocate taking strike actions or other irrelevant actions to avoid increasing difficulties and neglecting studies. However, a few students have spontaneously organized a "Committee to Protest American Military Atrocities" to launch strikes and parades, hoping to expand the situation.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day after the New Year holiday. Most schools in this city have resumed classes as usual, but a few students from Jiaotong University and other schools who participated in the "Shanghai Student Federation to Protest American Military Atrocities" implemented a "general leave" for one day to engage in publicity work, dividing into several groups to go to universities, middle schools, and elementary schools in this city that have not participated in the association to launch publicity and signature campaigns to win over the masses, but the students of each school were unmoved.</p>
<p>It is reported that the student self-government associations of various universities believe that the so-called "Committee to Protest American Military Atrocities" is only organized by a few students and is not enough to represent the school. In addition to the Fudan Self-Government Association's early statement, the Datong University Self-Government Association also issued a statement yesterday stating: "This Association is deeply indignant at the atrocities committed by American soldiers in Beiping this time. In addition to publishing a letter to students, it has also decided to convene a general assembly of all representatives on the 6th of this month. However, regarding the establishment of the so-called "Datong University Student Support Committee Against American Atrocities," this Association was not informed in advance, nor was it consulted afterward, and the association is only organized by a few students, and its actions cannot represent this school. We hereby solemnly declare."</p>
<p>[Also Reported] The New Year holidays of various schools in this city ended yesterday. All universities, except for Jiaotong University, which has not fully resumed classes, have resumed classes and are preparing for the semester exams. The situation is calm as usual. Student organizations such as the Guanghua Political Research Association, the Fudan Political Society, and the Datong University General Branch, and schools such as Mingde Girls' High School, Dezhi Middle School, and Minli Girls' High School, in response to the joint declaration of student organizations, issued a statement yesterday, which roughly stated that "We hope that our students will recognize the situation, distinguish between right and wrong, and not be incited by a few people to participate in strikes, parades, and riots, so as not to neglect their studies, or even damage their bodies, causing unfortunate consequences and being criticized" and so on.</p>

<h3>Numerous Robberies in Cold Weather: A Thief, Recently Released from Prison, Is Shot and Captured</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] At around 9:25 AM yesterday, five robbers arrived at the Kombu Factory Distribution Office at No. 6, Lane 599, Zhejiang Middle Road. Two of them stood guard at the entrance, while the remaining robbers entered the building and falsely claimed to be from Fujian to buy cloth. Suddenly, they pulled out guns and threatened the owner, Xia Zhifang, and the shop assistants, driving them into the back room. They began searching after covering them with cotton blankets. As a result, they robbed one large gold bar, 600,000 yuan in cash, three gold rings, one raincoat, one melton robe, one watch, and two pens, and then fled. Afterwards, the owner reported the incident to the Lao Zha Sub-bureau, and Sub-bureau Chief Shi Sijian immediately ordered Section Chief Jiang to lead officers to search the area near the scene of the incident. However, they found no trace of the robbers, but they did discover a fingerprint, which is currently under strict investigation.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, three robbers also occurred at the intersection of Gujia Lane and Beijing Road, and they held up Chuan Ming, a 15-year-old apprentice at a rice store. They stole 3,000,000 yuan in cash and a check for 6,400,000 yuan. The robbers fled westward after pushing the apprentice aside, but the apprentice pursued them, shouting "Robbers!" One of the robbers fled to the intersection of Guizhou Road, where he was apprehended by guard officer No. 3345. During the arrest, the robber resisted by drawing a gun, so the police officer fired a shot, hitting his left shoulder. After being taken back to the Lao Zha Police Station, he identified himself as Li Zhixue, 38 years old, from Jiangbei. He had a long criminal record and had been sentenced to ten years in prison, having just been released recently. Because the robber's wound was bleeding profusely, he was escorted to the police hospital for treatment. At the same time, an accomplice in the case, named Xu Jiangong, was arrested at the Xiamen Road intersection. Another escaped robber was still being pursued as of the evening.</p>
<p>At approximately 1:30 AM yesterday, three robbers broke into No. 463 Huaide Road, Shanghai East. Two of them were armed with Mauser pistols, ordering everyone not to make a sound. They stole 930,000 yuan in legal tender and other items of clothing.</p>

<h3>Unemployed Workers Returning from Abroad: Living in the Reception Center, Passing the Time Eating and Sleeping, Waiting for Tomorrow with Vague Expectations</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Workers who were deceived and forcibly conscripted by the Japanese in the past, or captured and transported abroad to do hard labor, are now returning to the country one after another. Traveling tens of thousands of miles, some worked in the snow-capped coal mines around Hokkaido, while others served as forced laborers in Southeast Asia, Burma, and Australia. Life was full of danger, bloodshed, sweat, hunger, cold, and whipping. After enduring this inhuman life of darkness, they have returned to their homeland. Their lives seem to have been snatched from the clutches of death.</p>
<p>After returning to the country, this group of workers is sent by the port headquarters to the relief sub-office, which then transfers them to the "Reception Center for Unemployed Workers Returning from Abroad" for shelter. Since its establishment on April 1st of last year, the reception center has first taken in more than 80 workers who returned from Japan. Later, workers stranded in Australia and Burma also returned to the country one after another. A total of more than 300 people have been accommodated, more than 100 of whom have already been sent back to their hometowns or introduced to jobs. There are still more than 160 people living in the reception center. The expenses of the reception center are allocated by the municipal government, and some food and clothing are provided by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. There are more than 30 rooms of various sizes, each accommodating five to six or seven to eight people. Their lives, apart from three meals a day, are spent sitting idly and sleeping. The rooms are poorly lit, the air is turbid, and the bedding and belongings are piled up in disarray, but for them, it is a temporary respite after a long period of hardship.</p>
<p>Respite is respite, but they still need to work. Apart from a dozen or so female workers, most of them are strong men, and this kind of stagnant and rigid life is a waste of energy.</p>
<p>They hope to find a career in their homeland, to get a job, but their homes have been destroyed and they cannot return home. Their jobs seem even more distant. This life that has been snatched back is not a happy one, and there are countless twists and turns and hardships to come.</p>
<p>Their only goal is to find work, but they lack specialized skills, and the domestic industry and commerce are in recession. There is a surplus of labor, and it is difficult to make progress. They can only pass each day eating and sleeping, waiting for each tomorrow with vague expectations.</p>
<p>The establishment of the reception center is commendable, but it lacks a rational organization and a positive driving force. If the strength of these workers were transferred to production, there would still be a need for manpower in the country. If they lack specialized skills, they should take this opportunity to strengthen training. At the very least, their lives should be more regular and orderly, which seems to be a point that the reception center has neglected.</p>

<h3>Female Secret Agent Gu Gu Xue Jinnuo: After Trial, Still Released on Original Bail</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Zhan Zhan Xue Jinnuo is a Soviet female citizen, 26 years old, who works as a hostess at the "Qiao Qiao Paishi" bar on Lin Sen Middle Road.

Regarding the fact that the Soviet consulate refused to issue a certificate of proof, she argued that if the Soviet consulate considered her actions suspicious, it had the right to revoke her passport, so there was no need to issue a separate certificate. At the end of the trial, it was announced that the owner of the "Qiao Qiao Paishi" bar would need to be summoned to testify, and the defendant remained on her original bail.

<h3>Year-End Bonus Disputes: Still Unresolved in the Silk Weaving Industry; Standards Set in the Cigarette Industry</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The year-end bonus issue in the Shanghai silk weaving industry has not been resolved as of yesterday. The employers are sticking to their previous proposal. The workers' demands have changed slightly, requesting that those who have worked for less than three months be given a six-day year-end bonus, with one more day added for each additional month of service. Those who have worked for nine months should be given eleven days, and those who have worked for ten months or more should be given twelve days. The Bureau of Social Affairs is drafting a compromise plan and is doing its best to mediate. However, the two silk factories of the China Silk Company have reached an agreement in principle on the year-end bonus issue. The two parties agreed that workers who have worked for less than one month will not receive a year-end bonus, and those who have worked for one month will receive a temporary payment of 135,000 yuan. Also, the two factories have been on strike since December 28 of last year, and the public has suffered heavy losses as a result. Therefore, wages will not be paid during this period, but holidays will be paid as usual. As for the exact amount of the year-end bonus, it will be issued in accordance with the standards of the private silk industry after the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The year-end bonus dispute in the Shanghai cigarette industry has been resolved, except for the Yizhong, Huacheng, Zhonghua, and Fuxin factories, which have resolved the issue themselves. The general standards have been set by the Bureau of Social Affairs as follows: (1) Those who have signed written records will continue to fulfill them in accordance with the written records. (2) Male and female daily-wage workers and monthly-wage workers will receive a bonus equal to 30 days' pay. If there are special profits, an additional 15 days will be added, but this should be distributed in proportion to the December pay. (3) The year-end bonus for female piece-rate workers will be 5% to 9.5% of their total annual income (calculated based on the cost of living index in December of last year).</p>

<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Wu Qihua, Cao Hong, and Ji Su, the prosecutors responsible for investigating the three plane crash disaster, continued to conduct various informal side investigations during the New Year's Day holiday. Yesterday, the Central Air Transport Corporation, in a letter signed by General Manager Chen Zhuolin, replied to the District Procuratorate, stating that the reason why flight 48 was diverted to Jiangwan Airport was to use the blind landing equipment controlled by radar.

<h3>Symphony Orchestra to Suspend? Mayor Wu Clarifies Denial</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Due to the municipal government's failure to pay salaries for one and a half months, the city's symphony orchestra musicians refused to participate in performances, leading to the cancellation of concerts at the Lyceum Theatre for the past two weeks. Numerous rumors circulated, including the orchestra's potential closure due to municipal funding shortages this year. Yesterday, our reporter met with Mayor Wu to inquire about the validity of these claims. Mayor Wu responded that there was absolutely no such thing. The symphony orchestra is the only cultural and musical group of the municipal government and must be maintained. Regarding the salary arrears of one and a half months, it is true, but there are special reasons. It is not due to the city's lack of funds that it could not be released on schedule, because there were some problems with the internal accounts of the group, and the municipal authorities are sorting it out. The reporter further asked whether it was possible that the current principal of the National Conservatory of Music, Dai Cuilun, would take over as the head of the symphony orchestra. The response was: This is possible. The municipal government has had preliminary discussions with Mr. Dai and has already submitted a report to the Ministry of Education. If the Ministry of Education approves his concurrent position, then with Mr. Dai's qualifications and achievements in music, he will certainly be able to fulfill the role happily.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the municipal symphony orchestra received the second half of November's salary a few days ago, and last month's salary will also be received within days. Therefore, today's Sunday concert will be held as usual at the Lyceum Theater at 5:00 pm. The program includes a solo performance by soprano Aili, Mrs. Magolinski. (Mrs. Ma is from Vienna, and her mother is a professor at the Vienna State Opera.) As well as Mozart's Croupierini song, Annie's Romance, G minor symphony, etc.</p>

<h3>Airplane Accidents and Weather - Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau</h3>
<p>— Lü Jiong</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there have been two airplane accidents last month. The first one was reported in the Shanghai News on the 14th of last month:</p>
<p>The passenger plane XT-T26 on the Ping-Hu route flew from Beijing to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 14th, carrying 33 boxes of banknotes, totaling 1.2 billion yuan, five boxes of gold, and a Jeep. At 4 p.m., it arrived in Changxing, but due to bad weather, it could not continue to fly. It seemed to intend to land at Changxing Airport, so it circled several times over the county, but at that time it encountered strong winds and heavy rain, and the sky was dark, causing it to collide with Bingshan Mountain. The fuselage caught fire, and the pilot and two passengers were all killed. Some of the legal tender inside the plane fluttered in the wind for more than ten miles... Also, China Airlines Flight 67 flew from Beijing to Shanghai at 5:20 pm that afternoon and landed at Longhua Airport. Due to the excessive wind, it collided with other parked airplanes in the field, fortunately no major disaster occurred...</p>
<p>The second airplane accident was on the 25th of last month, reported in the Shanghai News:</p>
<p>On the 25th, it was drizzling and foggy all day in this city (Shanghai). The fog was so thick that it was difficult to see anything beyond five feet. Due to this bad weather, three passenger planes crashed at the same time. Two of them were China Airlines passenger planes flying from Chongqing to Shanghai, and one was a Central Airlines passenger plane. ...China Airlines flight 140 could not find the airport due to the dense fog. After circling for more than an hour, it was forced to land due to running out of fuel. With a loud crash, the plane crashed to the ground and caught fire. The nose and front of the plane were completely shattered... Another China Airlines passenger plane, No. 115, also took off from Chongqing, with 33 passengers. When it arrived over Shanghai, the weather was so bad that it was destroyed outside the airport, one mile southwest of the Huangjiadu River Temple Tower. In addition, a Central Airlines C48 passenger plane was also forced to land at the Shanghai North Jiangwan Airport that evening due to bad weather. Due to the difficulty of distinguishing the dense fog, the direction went out of the airport and crashed into a farmer's house near Zhanghuabang, causing a fire.</p>
<p>We analyzed the weather conditions of these two airplane accidents. On the 14th, there was a strong cold wave (that is, a cold air mass) southward, so the wind was strong and the rain was heavy, and the airplane lost control. The reason was that the wind force was too great, and the sky was dark, the Central aircraft actually collided with the mountains, and the China Airlines aircraft collided with other aircraft parked on the ground when landing. The weather in Nanjing was also very bad that day, with a strong northeast wind, which was not suitable for flying. As for the weather conditions on the 24th, it was in the warm front, although the wind was calm and the rain was not strong, but it was drizzling, with dense fog covering the sky, and the visibility was extremely bad, which was also not suitable for flying.</p>
<p>Seven or eight out of ten airplane accidents in our country are due to unfavorable weather. I still remember that Mr. Dai Yunong flew from Qingdao to Beijing in mid-March this year and crashed near Banqiao Town, Jiangyin, due to bad weather, losing his life. However, unfavorable weather conditions are not unavoidable. As long as you can know the overall weather situation in the country that day, you can judge whether the weather is suitable for flying on that day. Generally speaking, the weather that is not suitable for flying is nothing more than the following: (1) When a strong cold wave goes south, the aircraft is difficult to control due to excessive wind force. This type of weather is more likely to occur in the winter half year, especially in winter. Even if the cold wave has just passed and the wind has weakened, but if the high-altitude temperature is too low, you still need to be careful when flying, because there is a danger of icing on the wings of the airplane, especially when traveling northeast or northwest, you must pay extra attention, because the temperature in the north is lower than in the south in winter. (2) When a warm front arrives, although the wind and rain are not strong, dense fog covers the sky, and the visibility is poor, the aircraft is most likely to lose its direction and not be able to find the airport. This type of weather occurs most often in winter and spring. (3) Summer thunderstorms are not suitable for flying. The reason is obvious and does not need to be explained. (4) It is also not suitable to fly within the scope of a typhoon, because the wind and rain are too sudden and it is difficult to control. This type of weather is most likely to occur in summer and autumn. In addition, mountainous areas have more dense fog in winter, and coastal areas can have fog in all seasons, winter, spring, and summer, depending on their location. The above are all common sense of meteorology in our country. As for the fundamental way to protect airplanes, of course, it is not enough to rely on common sense of meteorology. It is necessary to set up meteorological observation stations throughout the country, quickly transmit meteorological communications, and draw weather maps two or three times a day. If the number of times can be increased, it will naturally be better. A meteorological station should be set up on each airport, each station needs more than ten meteorological personnel, and senior personnel should be in charge of weather reports. In addition, airplane drivers should also be instilled with basic meteorological common sense, so that they can understand the changes in ordinary weather and be alert, so as not to take risks. European and American countries have already done this, so airplane accidents caused by weather reasons are rare. It is really too tragic for three airplanes to crash in one day. If the country spends a little more money and does a little meteorological work, thereby reducing the number of airplanes that crash each year and reducing the loss of life and property, I believe it is not a loss, and the effect can be seen immediately.</p>

<h3>Reader Inquiries - Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Coercive Eviction</p>
<p>Gui Yun asks: I am a third-hand tenant. Two years ago, I rented two rooms from a second-hand landlord. At that time, the term was one year, and I paid a deposit for six months. After the term expired, I continued to live by increasing the rent. After half a year, the rent was increased again, and a verbal lease was signed for another six months. In fact, it has become an indefinite lease, but now the lease has not yet expired (the rent is paid for six months in advance). The second-hand landlord is actually preparing to move out under the superior conditions of the first-hand landlord's promise to pay his moving expenses and not pursue the rent owed. He must force me to leave the house, but I cannot find a fort for a while, so it has become a stalemate. I have several questions here that I would like to ask for answers: (1) There are no special regulations on renting houses in Suzhou. Now that I cannot find a house to move into, I don't know how long I can live. (2) I prepaid a deposit for six months in September of the 33rd year. Is there any legal conflict in requesting a refund of the deposit now? (3) After the expiration of the contract, a new contract has not been revised since then. Each time the rent is increased and the rent is paid, it is only noted on the original rent book. Can all the conditions stated in the contract not be responsible? Can the guarantor also not be responsible? (4) If I still pay the rent after the term expires, and the second-hand landlord does not accept it, can I deposit the rent due in the bank? So as to prepare for legal negotiations.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia signs] (1) If the lease has not yet expired and the tenant is forced to move out under a legitimate lease, he can be accused of the crime of violent coercion to move out. (2) Cannot be used as a reason for renewal. (3) Should be regarded as a continuation of the contract with an indefinite term, and the guarantor can not be responsible. (4) You should apply to the court for a deposit in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Inheritance</p>
<p>Wang Zhongwei asks: A has three daughters. The eldest daughter is recruited as an heir, the second daughter is engaged to B, and the youngest daughter is still unmarried but is also planning to recruit a son-in-law. I would like to ask, regarding A's property inheritance, does the second daughter have the same rights as the first and second daughters?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] The second daughter has the same rights to inherit property as the first and youngest daughters after the death of her father, but before Mr. A passes away, he has the right to freely use, benefit from, and dispose of his property within the scope of legal restrictions. No one else may interfere.</p>

<h3>Government to Purchase Surplus Yarn and Cloth Factories Can Sell Freely but Cannot Arbitrarily Raise Prices or the Government will Order a Complete Purchase President Song Expressed Sincerity to the Cotton Spinning Industry Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., President Song of the Executive Yuan convened a talk with all the directors and supervisors of the Machine Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District at the Executive Yuan Office in the Bank of China Building on the Bund. Wang Qizi, Rong Hongyuan, Shu Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, Guo Dihuo, Liu Guojun, Xi Yushu, and others, totaling eighteen people, attended. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Wu concurrently Chairman of the Textile Control Committee, and Liu Wensheng, Director of the Business Department, also attended. First, Wu, concurrently Chairman of the Wuguan Committee, reported: In order to stabilize the market price of yarn and cloth, he has repeatedly negotiated with the Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District, and the circumstances of the meeting convened by the Wuguan Committee. The main points are: (1) It was decided to purchase 50% of the cotton production volume of each yarn factory in the Shanghai urban area. (2) The assessed price of the best-grade 20-count standard yarn is 1,975,000 yuan per piece. After Chairman Wu finished his report, President Song immediately asked Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Sixth District Association, whether the fellow industrialists in the association had any opinions on the new negotiated price agreed by the Textile Control Committee. Wang Chang replied: Each fellow industrialist expressed satisfaction with the new negotiated price.</p>
<p>President Song was quite gratified after listening to Wang's reply and said: From this, it can be seen that each fellow industrialist can cooperate with the government, and the government has actually given the textile industry more special treatment than other industries. In addition to the stipulated profit of 20%, the government must also provide huge amounts of foreign exchange required to purchase foreign cotton. Now that the government has decided to collect half of the yarn and cloth, the remaining half will still be sold freely by each factory on the market. However, it is hoped that the half of the yarn and cloth sold freely must consider the policy of stabilizing prices and cannot be allowed to rise arbitrarily. This is because the price of yarn and cloth has a great impact on other prices. Moreover, the original intention of the government was to purchase all yarn and cloth. Now it only purchases half of it, and its intention is to control the market price of yarn and cloth with this half purchased. If the market price of yarn and cloth still rises sharply in the future, the government can order the purchase of all yarn and cloth at any time, so I hope everyone will cooperate, this is one. Also, each factory once requested to only pay the government the production volume of two months' worth of cotton. President Song entrusted it as a rigid and time-limited regulation, which seemed unfair. The government decided to still collect half of the actual cotton production volume of each factory. From now on, the situation of yarn factories will definitely develop. In the future, no matter how low the price of foreign yarn is, the government will never allow it to be imported, so as to protect the interests and development of our country's textile industry.</p>
<p>Finally, Minister Wang stated: The price of the half of the yarn and cloth sold freely by each factory cannot be too high. At the same time, it is hoped that each factory should pay attention to production costs, for example, wages for workers and treatment for employees cannot be treated excessively without limitation. If production costs can be reduced, they can compete with foreign yarn. The profits gained should not be distributed immediately, but should be used to expand their own equipment. If costs are not taken into account and the treatment of employees is too generous, it will affect other industries.</p>
<h3>Solid Sales Seen Gold Prices Rise Results are 70,000 Higher than Before the Closure</h3>
<p>In addition to yesterday's explicit distribution by the Central Bank, there were very few underground sales. During the closure period, solid sales compensated, were firm, and opened in the morning with a leap to 3.55 million. From 3.58 million, some people sold to realize profits, and immediately fell back to within the 2.5 million mark, with the low price reaching 3.46 million and stabilizing. After ten o'clock, the Central Bank distributed 202 taels at a price of 3.48 million. The pressure on the Central Bank was very small. Silver shops and solid sales in various places were heavy, and it rebounded to 3.56 million. Near noon, it hovered between 3.52 million and 3.55 million, and then pulled up to 2.58 million again in the afternoon before stabilizing. As a result, it rose 70,000 from before the closure, ornaments were 375,000, silver dollars were slightly more expensive, and black market interest was between 1 jiao and 5 fen and 1 jiao and 8 fen.</p>
<p>Foreign currency was very stable yesterday. The black market for US dollars initially ranged from 6,300 to 6,500 in the morning, and then ranged from 6,200 to 6,400. In the afternoon, it rose slightly due to the rising spot price of gold, and hovered between 6,300 and 6,500 again, slightly more stable than before the closure. Hong Kong dollars once rose to 1,280 yuan with the price of gold, and finally sold for 1,250 yuan. The result was also dozens of yuan better. Exchange rates were 1,170 yuan to 1,200 yuan, Indian exchange rates were 1,400 yuan, and British exchange rates were around 18,800 yuan. Except for Hong Kong, which was relatively traded around 1,180 yuan, the rest were still mostly available but not marketed.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Slightly Decline</h3>
<p>Public bonds also saw a slight decline yesterday. The Tong Bing opened at 1,450 yuan in the morning. Although 652 rooms were purchased, 360 rooms were sold. From 1,460 yuan, it fell to below 1,420 yuan. As a result, it fell 130 yuan compared to the previous close. Jia and Yi also fell 100 yuan. Tong Ding was flat, while Tong Wu rose 20 yuan. The transaction was about 3 million yuan.</p>
<h3>42-count Double Strand Yarn Jumped Nearly 100,000</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose steadily yesterday. It opened at a low price in the morning, and all parties took risks. 10-count yarn rose slowly by 350,000 yuan, and 32-count yarn was even more popular, about 100,000 yuan. The 42-count double strand yarn was the most outstanding. Under the search of pure weaving factories, it jumped to 100,000 yuan. The trend was firm and the people were happy and prosperous.</p>
<h3>The Tea Market Still Shows No Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, all industries resumed trading as usual. The tea market in this street and the Kezhuang from all over the place was still lifeless. As for the foreign company transactions, the green tea such as Zhuzhen Zhenmei, which is mainly sold to French Africa, was the most active, and the selling price was also extremely profitable. The British company Renji Yangzhu watched the high-end Chen Qimen tirelessly. Under the sellers' insistence on scarcity, the process was not clear, and the market remained strong. Other varieties continued to lack improvement. According to people in the industry, Japan is currently preparing to actively sell a second batch of new tea to Casablanca, Africa. If it can be realized, Chinese tea will be further hit.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Turn Upward</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend turned firm, and all saw improvement. The public association's disk prices for existing white sugar were 141,234,000 yuan, stack orders were 133,457,000 yuan, raw sugar was 127,000 yuan, 65,000 yuan to 78,000 yuan, and stack orders were 120,000 yuan to 122,000 yuan. The increase in stack orders was higher, reaching 56,000 yuan. Other types of goods were also firm. Shunde Qing opened at 118,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan, Tiqing called for 125,000 yuan, Huanggang Qing was 120,000 yuan to 1223,000 yuan, Diao Qing called for 125,000 yuan, Che Baijing was 210,000, Che Baimi was 175,000 yuan, Xinghua Bai was 169,000 yuan to 45,000 yuan, and Xing Chi was 157,000 yuan to 162,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rough Yarn Pricing Too High Proportions to be Recalculated</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The six-point plan on stabilizing yarn and cloth market prices, after being approved by the Textile Control Committee and reviewed by President Song, was officially implemented on January 1 of this year. Currently, the Textile Control Committee and the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association are negotiating the procedures and methods for purchase. The purchase price has also been submitted to President Song for review, with the best-grade 20-count standard yarn priced at 1,975,000 yuan per piece. As for the prices of other counts of yarn, the original calculation ratio resulted in a price that was too high for coarse count yarn, which was not in line with the actual situation. Therefore, it was decided that Shu Yunzhang, Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Liu Wensheng, and others will discuss and set a percentage for calculating the prices of each count of yarn today.</p>
<h3>Underground Banks Not Eradicated Funds Escape to Hong Kong Not Prevented Financial Situation Difficult to Improve</h3>
<p>According to authoritative sources in the financial industry, in this environment of overall recession, financial institutions with stable operations are spending in a state of relatively high surplus. Looking back at the situation last year, the second half of the year was affected by the recession in the industrial and commercial sector, the dumping of foreign goods, the absorption of floating funds by underground banks and high-interest loans, and the massive escape of Yan Jin to Hong Kong. The financial business was not as prosperous as in the first half of the year. At present, although the authorities have strictly prohibited underground banks and the escape of floating funds to Hong Kong, various parties are still carrying out these bad businesses in a slippery and secret manner. It is not yet possible to predict whether the financial industry will be able to progress and prosper more firmly than last year. It depends on the effectiveness of the crackdown on these two bad businesses, and whether the industrial and commercial sectors can turn around and become active after accepting loans. In short, it depends on whether the decisions of the authorities can achieve results.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Conditions Firm</h3>
<p>After three days of market closure, the silk market conditions were quite stable yesterday, with no significant changes. Factory quotes remained unchanged, around 4.8 million yuan for D-grade, and a starting price of 4.5 million yuan for open goods. Canjing was priced at 300 million yuan. Not much happened in Zhuzuo, and the price of 120-count bright rayon was slightly better. Xuzi Zuo priced at 3.18 million yuan, and Gaoshan brand was priced at 1.67 million yuan, a big increase of 560,000 yuan compared to before the closure. Other semi-gloss goods did not do much, and the quotes were firm. The silk market was quite quiet, and the factory disks mostly maintained the original price. Huazhong Crepe was still priced between 3.45 million and 500 yuan yesterday.</p>
<h3>Vermicelli Rebounds</h3>
<p>Vermicelli, which was previously slack due to low sales, rebounded slightly. The local annual goods turnover has increased, and the price has recovered. Yesterday, high-quality vermicelli was priced at 230,000 yuan higher, reaching 3560,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Rises Sharply Indica Rice Rarely Seen on Formal Market Mixed Beans and Soybean Cake Rise and Fall Unevenly</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the new year's red market trading in the rice market. The total volume in the northern and southern markets was about 9,000 stones. Because the stores closed for three days at the beginning of the year, the stores were more eager to enter the market, and the weather was cloudy and rainy. The northern and southern japonica rice rose by 230,000 yuan uniformly. Baiyuan was in the period of Xiao Ling, and the turnover turned smoothly, and it rose by 230,000 yuan. Yinyuan was profitable, and it also rose by 340,000 yuan. Indica rice was scarce and still rarely seen on the formal market. Soybeans also rose by 120,000 yuan due to the strong absorption of this street. Mung beans were weak in both arrival and sales, and there was not much honor or disgrace. Red beans were firm, corn was the opposite of supply and demand, and it was unwilling to open. The ground was quite solid. Sesame was strongly taken by Guangbang, and it continued to rise by 340,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were also bought happily by Guangfang, and continued to rise by 560,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were traded in Shantou, Xiamen, Jianzhou, and Taiwan. Mainland and Shenfang oil factories all had supply sources. The situation was prosperous in both arrival and sales. Oil prices rose and fell unevenly. There were many green island imports of raw oil, and the raw oil fell back by 230,000 yuan. Soybean oil was firm at first and then tired. The result was similar to the previous year's closing price. Clear oil also had no rise or fall. Only sesame oil rose by 350,000 yuan due to scarce goods and active sales. Flour rose by 220,000 yuan due to the unresolved factory strike and temporary suspension of work. Imports were scarce and the stores were very greedy. Bran rose by 1200 yuan.</p>

<h3>Many Hua Stock Swap Transactions; Commercial Press Listing Immediately Hits Limit Down</h3>
<p>Hua stock debuted yesterday, but trading was not seen to develop, and the market situation was bleak. Many who followed the gold market in speculation were too crowded. A large yarn and cloth group suddenly closed out a portion, and near noon it suddenly plummeted drastically. The future is not promising. The swap discount started with someone bidding at thirty yuan, and gradually decreased to around twenty-two yuan. The daily interest was less than 1.5 cents. The financial sector, such as Xingye, Xinhua, and Tongshang, all participated in the bidding. Yarn and cloth securities bulls, as well as Shengda, all swapped around twenty-seven yuan. Therefore, the situation was very calm. The morning opening was high due to the gold market looking good. After the opening, there were profit-takers emerging. No. 177 sold spot Yong yarn, and Nos. 198, 76, 47, and 152 sold forward Yong yarn. The market dropped to 617 yuan for spot transactions and 643 yuan for forward transactions. After 10:00 AM, the gold market stabilized again. Nos. 145 and 232 bid for spot Yong yarn, and the price once rose by more than ten yuan. Liann Department Store was listed at the upper limit by No. 31, but because Guangbang's No. 155 vigorously sold spot Yong yarn, the upward momentum was repeatedly blocked. Nos. 152, 212, and 47 all sold off, and the price remained depressed. Commercial Press was sold by No. 160 to the lower limit. However, midway through, due to the strength of gold and cloth, many retail investors maintained their positions. After 11:30 AM, Nos. 16, 137, 212, and 47 all sold spot Yong yarn, and Nos. 212 and 47 also sold forward Yong yarn. Near noon, speculative longs frantically cut their positions, and the market closed at a low price. As a result, compared to before the opening, Yong yarn and Xinhe each fell by 3-4%, Jingfu and Qinxing fell slightly, Huafeng was flat, and Xinguang and Meiya each fell by slightly less than 10%. Cold stock matches rose slightly, and the rest were relatively stable. Forward Yong yarn and Huafeng fell slightly, Xinhe fell by slightly less than 5%, and Xinguang fell by slightly less than 10%. Outside the market, various stocks in Zhabei rose slightly, Nanyang fell slightly, and the rest were flat.</p>
<p>The assistance of the gold market to foreign stocks yesterday was only able to show a little bit of shine. After Yi yarn traded at 7150 yuan, new buyers were on the sidelines. Except for Jardine Matheson and Wheelock &amp; Co. (copper) rising slightly, the rest declined a little.</p>
<h3>Soap and Candle Factories Endangered Under Pressure from Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>The local soap and candle industry suffered a slump last year due to massive imports and dumping of foreign goods. Currently, out of more than 50 companies, half have already been shut down. According to Liang Songling, chairman of the industry association, the soap production volume is: (1) 1.5 million boxes of laundry soap, 46 pounds per box, totaling 6.9 million pounds; (2) 300,000 boxes of toilet soap, 30 pounds per box, totaling 900,000 pounds. The raw materials required are 80% tallow, 20% coconut oil, 18% caustic soda, 5% salt, and 48,750 dan of fuel. To increase production, government assistance is needed to supply raw materials, especially caustic soda. In addition, a large amount of funding is needed, and the collection of business tax should be improved so that the tax is based on the capital amount, not the turnover. The raw materials for candle production are also in great need. If imports of foreign candles can be restricted, then domestic candle production will have a chance to survive.</p>
<h3>Zhongfang Rayon Price 30% Lower Than Market Price</h3>
<p>After the New Year holiday, China Textile Construction Corporation announced the listed prices of rayon yesterday morning, which were 30% lower than the market price. The prices are as follows: (1) Plain cocoon, 28 inches, white, 2,700 yuan per yard; (2) Spun silk, 36 inches, white, 4,500 yuan per yard; (3) Cotton fabric, 29 inches, beige, 2,800 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Arrive in Abundance, Transactions Abnormally Quiet</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of woolen fabrics and melton have been sluggish due to seasonal factors and various environmental conditions. The demand from customers on Tai Street is quiet, and retail and wholesale transactions are weak. The goods ordered from abroad previously have now arrived one after another. The influx is the largest seen in a year. However, the issuance of permits is quite slow, and trading companies are not optimistic. Currently, there are very few new orders from abroad, so the Shanghai market price, except for heavy goods, has gradually increased for light goods.</p>
<h3>China-Siam Shipping Route Successfully Opened; "Hai Lie" Ship Carries 3,000 Tons</h3>
<p>According to news from the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday: The "Hai Lie" ship, which sailed on its maiden voyage on the China-Far East route in mid-December, has completed its glorious mission. The voyage lasted 18 days. The ship has already loaded 3,000 tons of Siamese rice in Bangkok for shipment to Shanghai. This batch of rice is part of the 30,000 tons of foreign rice ordered by our country from Siam. Therefore, the source of foreign rice will be more abundant in the future. The food supply in our city is not expected to be lacking. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, our country's ships only sailed on the North and South Ocean and Yangtze River routes and were often squeezed out by foreign companies. After the victory, in addition to the China-Philippines route between Shanghai and Manila, which is already served by the "Hai Xia" ship, the opening of the route between our country and Siam has also been successfully completed, which is a pioneering achievement in the history of our shipping industry.</p>
<h3>New York Silver Price Falls</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 1st] Approximately 150,000 ounces of silver were sold in New York today at 83 cents (US) per ounce, reflecting sellers' efforts to sell off year-end inventory amid calm demand. Consumer factories are not expected to resume work until after January 6.</p>
<p>Another report: Handy &amp; Harman, a gold and silver broker, today reduced its New York silver price by one cent (US) to 82 and 3/4 cents per ounce.</p>
<p>Another report: Amid recent silver price declines, daily sales of silver in New York have averaged around 100,000 ounces, while the amount offered for sale has been around 200,000 ounces per day. Buyers have shown no further interest in purchasing the large quantities of foreign silver recently shipped to New York from China, India, the United Kingdom, and the Near East. Most of this silver is forward-dated and needs to be refined, so there is clearly no demand. A U.S. silver consumer sought to purchase a considerable quantity of refined foreign silver from the Near East but has not received a response. Six million ounces of Spanish silver coins are being prepared for refining. It is suspected that around three million ounces of Spanish silver coins have already been shipped to the United Kingdom for refining. It has been announced that these downward trends only occurred when silversmiths stopped purchasing. At that time, they had already produced goods for the Christmas market, cleared factories, reduced product types, and sold large amounts of scrap silver. However, the trade hopes that consumers can quickly resume their normal daily purchases.</p>
<h3>Central Cooperative Treasury; Shanghai Branch Opens Tomorrow; Multiple National Branches Already Established</h3>
<p>The Central Cooperative Treasury was established in Chongqing in the autumn of the 29th year of the Republic (1940) by the government to assist in rural economic construction. At that time, due to the wartime situation, all business could not be promoted smoothly. Last year, after approval by the Ministry of Finance, an additional 10 billion yuan of funds were allocated. It officially started business in Beijing on November 1, and promoted work. At the same time, branches were set up in various places. Branches have been established in the Northeast, as well as three sub-branches in Changchun, Jinzhou, and Shenyang. Four sub-branches have also been established in the pacification zone, such as Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Taixing, and Bengbu. Branches are still being planned in Henan and its sub-branch in Kaifeng, Shandong, Rehe and its two sub-branches in Chifeng and Chengde, Chahar and its sub-branch in Zhangjiakou. It is planned to set up branches in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangzhou, and Chongqing this year. It is learned that the Shanghai branch of the Treasury has been prepared and will open on the 6th of this month. Gu Zhuqi and Ma Ran will serve as the general manager and deputy manager, respectively. It is heard that its main business at present is to assist in the establishment of county cooperative treasuries and to provide loans for cooperative businesses.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cocoons Continue to Be Shipped to China; Still Hoping for Successful Negotiations</h3>
<p>According to Ge Jingzhong, general manager of China Silk Corporation, regarding the news from General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo that the shipment of Japanese dried cocoons to China can continue to be negotiated, the company has not yet heard anything. However, at present, silk reeling factories in various parts of our country have stopped work due to insufficient raw materials. Even if the negotiations for this batch of Japanese cocoons are successful and they are shipped to our country, it will take at least two months, that is, after the Spring Festival. At that time, our country's domestically produced dried cocoons will also be supplied, so there is not much need for them. However, if they are cheap and of good quality, and they are verified by our country, we still welcome their shipment and sale to our country.</p>
<h3>United Credit Bureau Relocates</h3>

The internal organization of the bureau includes the following groups under the deputy manager: investigation, news, English, and general affairs, as well as a printing department.

<h3>Private Elementary Schools in the City Hold Separate Meetings to Discuss Teacher Salary Issues; Private Elementary School Teacher Monthly Salary Set at 500,000 Yuan for Next Semester</h3>
<p>The Private Elementary School Teachers Association of this city held a representative meeting at the New Life Club on Weihaiwei Road yesterday morning. More than a hundred representatives from various schools attended. Chaired by Wang Weiqun, it was resolved that the monthly salary for teachers in the next semester would be 500,000 yuan. At noon, Speaker Pan, Director Fang, Deputy Director Gu, and Deputy Director Li, as well as Councilors Zhou Feicheng and Chen Baotai, were invited to a banquet to preside over the meeting. Director Fang first expressed sympathy. Director Gu and Deputy Director Li also said that teacher salaries should be increased.</p>
<p>Speaker Pan Expresses that Private Schools Must Charge Fees</p>
<p>Speaker Pan stated that the educational expenses of the national schools in this city are fully borne by the government, which requires 80 billion yuan per year. The municipal budget proposed by the municipal government for this year is 230 billion yuan. If 35% is allocated to educational expenses as stipulated by the Constitution, it may be sustainable. However, the city is currently unable to bear this huge amount of taxes, so private schools must charge tuition to maintain the livelihoods of teachers. Finally, Jiang Jizhou stated that the lives of private school teachers have been more stable this semester, and their work efficiency and interest have improved significantly. The treatment of 500,000 yuan for the next semester is quite fair. However, the treatment of municipal school teachers in the next semester is only 340,000 yuan. It is hoped that the Municipal Council and the Municipal Government will plan a welfare fund of 160,000 yuan per month for each municipal school teacher, so that the lives of municipal school teachers can also be stabilized. It is also heard that the Private Primary and Secondary School Joint Association has set the amount of tuition for the next semester based on this standard.</p>

<p>The original four matches in the football league yesterday, including Longjie vs. Youyou in Group A, were all postponed due to bad weather and rain all day. There will be another five matches in the league and the Youth Cup today. However, the match between Railway and Soviet B has been postponed due to water accumulation at the Jinyuan Park venue. Only nine matches remain. If the weather is rainy, the audience can listen to the Qingnian Cultural Radio Station (frequency 1220 meters) or the Shanghai Radio Station (frequency 900 meters) at noon, or call Yiyuan, Zhengzheng Park, and the Football Committee for inquiries.</p>

With a neat combination, they should be able to win again.</p>

<h3>A Splendid Scene in College Basketball: Datong Dramatically Defeats Jiaotong; in the College Group, Fazheng Defeats Tongde</h3>

Originally, there were three matches scheduled: Fazheng vs. Tongde in the college group, Tizhuan vs. Jiaoda in the women's group, and Jiaoda vs. Datong in the "Xue" (student) group.

<p>In the first match, Fazheng faced Tongde in the college group. The referees were Li Zhengzhong and Zhu Mingxing. After the whistle blew, both sides adopted strict formations. For six minutes, the scoreboard remained at zero. Tongde's center Dai Jin seized an opportunity to jump up and score a basket, creating the first record. Fazheng's forward Zha Jingshan was not to be outdone and scored a basket as well. The first quarter ended with Fazheng trailing Tongde by one point at 5-4. At the beginning of the second quarter, the difference between the two sides remained minimal. After tying at 7-7, Tongde briefly took the lead at 11-10. Later, Fazheng's Xiang Ting and Sun Zhenlin each scored with long-range shots, allowing them to take the lead at 14-11 by the end of the first half. After switching sides, Fazheng's offense intensified. Tongde only managed to score two points, while Fazheng increased their score to 33. In the final quarter, Tongde's Zhuang Ren'an repeatedly scored with long-range shots, but the overall situation was already beyond recovery. In the end, Fazheng defeated Tongde with a score of 44-33.</p>
<p>Women's Performance</p>

<p>Datong Leads All the Way: In the final match, Jiaoda faced Datong. The Jiaoda team has made significant progress under the guidance of national team player Li Zhengzhong. Unfortunately, they did not use man-to-man defense at the beginning and their offense was slow, which allowed Datong to capitalize on several opportunities. Datong's Wang Bowen scored the first point, followed by Lin Weicong and Xu Zhongyi, who successively broke through the basket. Jiaoda's Shen Beijun and Ni Ziqi tried hard to catch up. At the end of the first quarter, Datong was leading with a score of 20-12. In the second quarter, Jiaoda played more calmly, but Datong's Xu Zhongyi was tall and had long arms, and Lin Weicong ran all over the court. At the end of the first half, Jiaoda was still behind with a score of 18-26.</p>
<p>Jiaotong Fights Hard but Suffers Defeat</p>
<p>After switching sides and resuming play, Jiaoda changed its strategy and managed to tie the score at 31-31. Datong's main player Xu Zhongyi committed his fifth foul and had to leave the court. The quick-footed Lin Weicong seemed to have little support, but Datong was still leading with a score of 40-35 at the end of the third quarter. In the final quarter, Jiaoda's Shen Beizhang scored continuously. Datong's Lin Weicong also fouled out of the game. Jiaoda was only one point behind Datong. Seeing the end of the match approaching, Jiaoda launched a fierce attack. Datong's defense was under immense pressure. Datong's Wang Bowen made a three-point shot before the end of the match, securing the victory. When time ran out, Jiaoda lost to Datong by one point with a score of 49-47.</p>

<h3>The Bright Side of Military Reorganization and Nation Building: From Consumption to Production, Turning Destruction into Construction</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Fang Canglang</p>
<p>It has been over a year since China's victory, but due to ongoing internal conflicts, disrupted transportation, semi-abandoned agriculture, and declining industry, at least 200 million people in the country are still struggling on the brink of starvation. This situation is indeed distressing and disappointing. In this time of economic hardship, concerned individuals are deeply worried about the crises in finance, banking, industry, and commerce. They hope that the internal conflicts can be resolved as soon as possible, transportation can be restored quickly, and all the destroyed industrial and mining enterprises can be rapidly rebuilt, so that the government's plan for military reorganization and troop reduction can proceed smoothly. The vast and astonishing amount of military spending can be saved and diverted to reviving rural areas, helping industry and commerce, and promoting general education and cultural undertakings, in order to alleviate the current pressing economic crisis. At the same time, it should also give some respite to the people who are groaning, trembling, and fearing the harsh policies of conscription and grain requisition. This is not a luxury; it is indeed the insightful view of concerned patriots. If our military reorganization and troop reduction, our plan to turn destruction into construction and change consumption into production, cannot be carried out in today's bankrupt rural areas and struggling industries and businesses, and we continue to support more than 200 divisions of troops (according to recent reports, the current troop strength of the KMT and the Communist Party), the future of China's economy is truly unimaginable. Fortunately, amidst the disappointment, we can still see a glimmer of hope for the future of nation-building in the government's implementation of the military reorganization plan. This is what we have seen and heard from autumn to winter this year: the various expressions of more than 10,000 demobilized officers of the Sixth Army Officer General Headquarters in Nanchang during their training period before transferring to civilian life. If the achievements of this demobilized officer retraining can become a trend and be widely seen in every corner of China, we firmly believe that not only will all the military post-war problems arising from military reorganization and troop reduction not be a problem, but also those unruly behaviors such as disliking people, not listening to ears, hitting theaters, rushing to brothels, and destroying stations may gradually decrease and eventually disappear.</p>
<h3>Officers Changing Careers, Rising Rapidly</h3>
<p>Last October, when the victory had just been won and the sound of cannons had just stopped, people who were keen on internal warfare were taking the opportunity to expand their armies, seize roads, destroy mines, compete for surrender, and grab land. The wise Chairman Chiang finally began to implement his plan for military reorganization and nation-building, regardless of everything else. The senior generals who assisted in planning this military reorganization plan at that time were Generals He Jingzhi, Bai Jiansheng, and Chen Cixiu. During this period, the General Headquarters of the Sixth Army Officer General Headquarters, in an unprecedented scale, was born in Qingyunpu, the only scenic area in the suburbs of Nanchang. The construction began in mid-October. The initial name was the Ninth War Zone Officer General Headquarters, and it began to recruit over 2,000 demobilized officers. On January 9th of this year, the war zone was abolished and it was transferred to the Ministry of Military Administration, and it was named as it is today. At that time, the first batch of demobilized officers from various army divisions and unemployed officers in the Jiangxi area totaled more than 3,900 people. By mid-April, the former General Commander of the General Headquarters was ordered to return to work at the Military Commission, and then Chen Pei, a lieutenant general who was both academically excellent and had made great achievements in the Anti-Japanese War in the Xiangbei Battle, was appointed as the General Commander of the General Headquarters. Chen had graduated from the military academy and the Army University. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, he was known to Generals Chen Cixiu and Xue Bailing for his role in defending Jinji Ridge to the death. General Commander Chen's strengths are perseverance, calmness, the ability to share the joys and sorrows of officers and soldiers, and a lack of desire for fame and wealth. He is an excellent military education talent, so he was able to gain the trust of his superiors and the love of his students.</p>
<h3>Second Lieutenants and Lieutenant Generals, Up to 12,000</h3>
<p>After Chen took over as the head of the Sixth Army Officer General Headquarters, he soon received the Twenty-seventh Army Officer General Headquarters and recruited more than 5,000 unemployed officers with military school qualifications for the second time. By the end of July, the Sixth Army Officer General Headquarters had recruited as many as 12,000 officers who were preparing to transfer to civilian life, making it the largest officer general headquarters in the country and gradually becoming the largest military education group in the country with the most students and the most diverse subjects. The officers who were receiving transfer training in this large group ranged in rank from second lieutenants to lieutenant generals. Most of them were generals who had fought hundreds of battles in the Third and Ninth War Zones, and even platoon leaders, company commanders, and battalion and regimental commanders who had always been in the vanguard.</p>
<h3>Army Commanders and Platoon Leaders Relive School Life</h3>
<p>They never dreamed that after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they would be "demobilized" immediately and quickly assigned to the Officer General Headquarters. Whether they had been army commanders, division commanders, or even company or platoon leaders, they were treated equally, reliving the most disciplined school life and receiving basic training in nation-building such as police administration, transportation, industry and mining, agricultural reclamation, land surveying, local administration, health, labor, civil training, and education. As of early September, the General Headquarters had selected more than 2,100 officers to receive the above-mentioned vocational training at the Jiangxi Provincial Training Corps. Over 80 generals were sent to the General Officers Class of the Central Training Corps for training. Over 500 officers were trained in land surveying, finance, banking, and at police academies. In addition, over 500 people who had participated in civil service work in the army during the Anti-Japanese War have resigned as ordered. Many of them are college and high school students with excellent character and scholarship. Some of the outstanding officers who remain in the team have been selected to serve in various army divisions. Currently, over 6,000 officers remain in the team. Among them, 1,500 are processing their first retirement, and the rest are strengthening their transfer preparations. It is expected that by the end of this year, they will be able to take up new positions and engage in nation-building work in various departments to achieve the goal of demobilization.</p>

<h3>Chairman Visits the School and Praises the Achievements of the General Headquarters</h3>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang personally visited Nanchang in early autumn to inspect all the officers receiving training at the General Headquarters, and publicly praised the great achievements and excellent military discipline of the General Headquarters at the Nanchang各界 (all circles) Welcome Chairman General Assembly, based on reports from all walks of life in Jiangxi and the speakers and vice speakers of the Provincial Senate, the reputation of the Sixth Army Officer General Headquarters has spread throughout the country, and intellectuals who are concerned about the important issue of China's reconstruction also believe that the government's military post-war measures have achieved considerable success. However, the fact that 12,000 officers were concentrated near Qingyunpu in Nanchang in the past, within a radius of 30 li, and the General Headquarters was able to complete such a complex and difficult officer retraining work in a short period of time with simple equipment, truly shows the hard work and effort of General Commander Chen, Deputy General Commanders Zhang, Deputy General Commander Li, and hundreds of generals and school instructors. The key to its success lies in the thoroughness of spiritual education and the proper application of the work system. According to some of the officers who received training, they came to the team with a lot of complaints and reluctance. Everyone inevitably felt a little uncomfortable. Later, they were moved by General Commander Chen's example of setting a good example in everything and publicly disclosing finances first, and they also admired his personality. In addition, the General Headquarters had long developed a spirit of self-awareness, autonomy, and self-government. Everyone knew to be ashamed and study hard, and to do their best in the face of difficulties. Therefore, even on holidays, most of the students stayed in the team to study and raise funds themselves, and rarely went out for entertainment. Therefore, in any public entertainment venues in Nanchang, there were few cases of students making trouble or fighting. The fact that soldiers in a provincial capital with a large population did not occupy civilian houses, watch free shows by force, or commit incidents such as beating up innocent civilians and disrupting military discipline is rare and valuable today.</p>
<h3>A Good Story in the Military: Five Generations Under One Roof</h3>
<p>In addition, some interesting anecdotes about the officers of this Officer General Headquarters during their training are also worth reporting to readers. In class, they sometimes discovered good stories of four or five generations under one roof. Many platoon leaders discovered that their past battalion commanders, regimental commanders, division commanders, and even army commanders were receiving training with them, which made them feel very interested and unusually close. This kind of collective training method is indeed unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. Therefore, such a complaining group finally merged into a great and lofty nation-building cause, regardless of age or rank, and naturally and happily forged some new talents for nation-building, each according to his own preferences and needs. Although at that time, it was necessary to select a group of suitable trainees to go to Northeast China or Shandong and other places in order to maintain local order and protect the interests of the people, and to relive military life, which occasionally caused them to ask a little doubt: "Eh, you said we were building the country, why are you just calling a few of us to lead troops to fight?" However, after General Chen Pei, who was sincere, straightforward, and gentle, explained this way: "For example, to lay the foundation for building a house, you must first clean up the garbage. Looking at road construction, you must also level the dirt. Now, when we are building the country, treacherous and deceitful people are deliberately creating obstacles and causing hardship to the people. If we don't remove these obstacles, not only will the achievements of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War be wasted, but the country will not be a country in the future!" Before the speaker finished speaking, the listeners also expressed their eagerness and begged with clenched teeth: "Since we have dedicated ourselves to the country, we will do whatever is needed. We are willing to be policemen, and it is also a great thing to change careers to transportation. It is a man's joy to open up a new world from industry, mining, agriculture, and reclamation. If we are transferred to local administration and given the work of township chiefs to be at the forefront of the people, this is also something we should do. We are not afraid of death, and even if we carry soil and stones, we will be happy to do so. Now, if the future of nation-building is full of obstacles, we dare not refuse to go to the Northeast, which is below freezing in the dead of winter!" How heroic are the soldiers, donning and doffing their armor, living and dying according to the country's commands. The achievements of education are like this, and it does not betray Chairman's hard work and concern for the country's talent reserves!</p>
<h3>Self-Improvement and Striving for Revival</h3>
<p>— Cai Wenzhi</p>
<p>Time flies, and the New Year is upon us again. This time last year, the whole country was celebrating the New Year in a frenzy of victory, thinking that after eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we had finally won and could strive for strength and construction, and place the country among the ranks of the great powers. Who knew that some people would seize military power and create internal strife, so that even though it has been more than a year since the victory, the people have not enjoyed the fruits of victory at all. Domestic rebellion has become increasingly serious, and most of our compatriots are still in deep water and fire, and their suffering has not been relieved. This is the reality before our eyes.</p>
<p>Current Objectives</p>
<p>As we celebrate the New Year amidst this turbulent domestic and international situation, our hearts are filled with heavy emotions. However, the revolutionary cause cannot be achieved overnight. The closer the revolution is to success, the more stubborn the forces hindering the revolution will be, trying to put up a last-ditch struggle. As long as we can strengthen our faith, march in step, and use the spirit of a strong man cutting off his wrist to eliminate the forces of counter-revolution and pseudo-revolution, eradicate all feudal remnants, separatist warlords, corrupt officials, local bullies, and evil gentry, then the revolutionary cause will surely succeed, and the revolutionary future will be bright.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "The plan for the year lies in the spring." This is true for individuals, and it is also true for the country. On this auspicious day, I would like to offer a few points as goals for our efforts this year, and I hope to encourage all our compatriots:</p>
<p>Complete Unification</p>
<p>First, if we want the great cause of nation-building to succeed smoothly, we must first complete the unification of the country. If the country is not unified, society cannot be stable, internal conflicts will inevitably be frequent, and there will be no way to start any construction work. The unification of the country must be based on the unification of military and political orders as a prerequisite. Within a country, there cannot be two opposing armies or local governments that form separatist regimes. If all parties have the sincerity to serve the country and the people, they should join the government organization and strive for political power through political means. If they seize power by force, it will not only increase the suffering of the people, but also lead to the demise of the country. In order to safeguard the survival of the country, we must firmly oppose any behavior that undermines unification, and we must not fall for their propaganda tricks or be deceived by their beautiful slogans.</p>
<p>Complete Constitutional Government</p>
<p>Second, the current international trend is democracy. The theory of democracy is government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and the purpose of the Three Principles of the People is to transform China into a country of the people, by the people, and for the people. If we want to save the people from their plight, the most urgent task is to thoroughly implement the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of People's Livelihood. The current important tasks of political construction under the Principle of Democracy are to complete constitutional government and realize political democratization. We must support the government in convening the National Assembly, promulgating the constitution, and expanding the government organization so that the people can participate in politics and lay the foundation for the long-term stability and peace of the country.</p>
<p>Promote Construction</p>
<p>Third, the purpose of human life is to improve life and satisfy the enjoyment of people's lives. To achieve this goal, we must move towards industrialization and machine production. The United States has only been established for 200 years, but because of its attention to industrial construction, it has become the richest and strongest country in the world. China is very rich in resources, but it does not know how to use them, resulting in national poverty and people's poverty. In the future, the economic construction of completing the Principle of People's Livelihood should focus on promoting industrial construction, developing machinery, and using machine production as the first priority.</p>
<p>Develop Science</p>
<p>Fourth, since this war ended with the use of atomic energy, we must be aware that we have entered a new era. China has fallen behind two eras, one is the machine age and the other is the atomic energy age. If we want to catch up with the United States and the Soviet Union, we must actively promote science. China has not always ignored science in the past, but because of a lack of firm belief and vigorous implementation, it has often been a case of one day's effort followed by ten days of neglect, so there has been little success. Japan's promotion of science did not start earlier than China, but because of its firm belief and universal education, the usefulness of science has been greatly seen. China's current industrial backwardness and weak national defense are due to the underdevelopment of science. In the future, regardless of how the country's fortunes change, we must promote science on a large scale and universally, enlighten it from daily life in society, so that everyone can investigate things and explore principles, and gradually move towards using things to improve people's lives, enrich the people, and strengthen the country. Only in this way can we catch up with today's era.</p>

<h3>Northeast Education</h3>
<p>— From Shenyang Air Dispatch on the 28th of December. Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Han Qingtao.</p>
<p>Merchant Marine Mongolian Banner School</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's established rehabilitation plan includes setting up a "National Changbai Normal College" in Yongji. In August of the 35th year of the Republic, the Ministry appointed Fang Yongzheng as the director in charge of preparations. The original site of the puppet Manchukuo "Jilin Shida University" was allocated for the college. Enrollment is now complete, and procedures for students to commence their studies are being handled. Classes should begin soon.</p>
<p>The Ministry decided to establish a National Changchun University in Changchun. The Guidance Committee sent three members—Yang Zhihuan, Yao Pengling, and Gao Shijia—to Changchun in June to take over various puppet Manchukuo universities. They will utilize the complete school buildings as the preparation office for Changchun University and carry out preparatory work. In August, the Ministry of Education appointed Huang Rujin as the director in charge of preparations. Huang arrived in Changchun in late August and immediately began preparatory work, including hiring professors, repairing school buildings, and handling student admissions and examinations. Preparations are now largely complete, and the school will soon open.</p>
<p>The entire premises of the "Huludao Merchant Marine School" are currently occupied by the U.S. military and the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) office in Huludao. The U.S. military can only withdraw after completing its repatriation work, and the UNRRA work is expected to conclude by March of next year. Currently, the entire facility cannot be vacated. After repeated negotiations, UNRRA has released a portion of the buildings as dormitories for the personnel guarding the school. The entire facility will be taken over once the above two groups have vacated the premises. Furthermore, the school's original 132 students urgently need to be properly settled to avoid losing their chance at education. Considering that maritime talent is urgently needed by the country, the Ministry has approved the establishment of the "National Huludao Merchant Marine School" at the original site. The Ministry has appointed Wang Shize as the principal, and Principal Wang has already arrived in Panjin to discuss preparatory matters.</p>
<p>Mongolian Banner compatriots live in remote border areas and are often disconnected from central government policies. To improve their knowledge and consolidate the border defense, a request was submitted to the Ministry of Education to establish a Mongolian Banner Normal College. The Ministry ordered the temporary establishment of a "National Liaomeng Normal School" in Sipingjie or Changchun. Qi Binru has been appointed by the Ministry as the head of the school, with plans for a formal opening in the spring of next year, which will contribute to national reconstruction.</p>
<p>Andong Province has been recovered, and educational undertakings urgently need rehabilitation. Regarding higher education, the Guidance Committee previously requested and obtained approval from the Ministry of Education to establish a "National Andong Agricultural and Industrial College" in Andong, capable of accommodating 500 to 700 students. College takeover commissioner Liu Yuwu has been dispatched to Andong to handle the affairs of the unified takeover committee and the education group of the Andong branch, as well as to survey the site for the Agricultural and Industrial College. Furthermore, the Ministry has ordered Supervisor Sun Aitang to travel to Andong to inspect and prepare for the establishment of the college.</p>
<p>Students have been actively protecting the school, so the original equipment has largely remained undamaged. Based on the original scale, it has been renamed the "Ministry of Education, Shenyang Youth Re-enrollment and Employment Guidance Center Secondary School Preparatory Class" to accommodate the original students. Guo Xinqiu has been appointed as the director, responsible for reorganization.</p>
<h3>An American's View of China</h3>
<p>— By Mr. Gold, Editor-in-Chief of the Shanghai English-language "China Press"</p>
<p>Any well-meaning American who looks at China has only one view, which must be based on close friendship and place high hopes on the future.</p>
<p>I say this not with flattery, as many such articles do, nor am I being sentimental. My belief is that the United States and China have always been very good friends, so we not only can but should be frank with each other.</p>
<p>Views on Chinese People - Daring Not to Be Arrogant</p>
<p>The beginning of this article is truthful, and it is pleasing that these words are pleasant. In fact, there are also many unpleasant truths that, if both sides could openly acknowledge, might further benefit both countries.</p>
<p>Although I am not writing this from the perspective of a Chinese person looking at America, it might not be without value if, at the outset, I could first consider what criticisms the Chinese might have of me and my fellow countrymen. I feel that we Americans seem more susceptible to criticism in psychological aspects than in material ones. We have repeatedly given China large amounts of materials and money, far more than we have received from China—whether as gifts or from what the Chinese often criticize as foreign economic aggression. We substantially helped China win the war of resistance against Japan, although many Chinese criticize us for helping too slowly. However, it may be unavoidable that our attitude is sometimes less than humble. We Americans, as guests in foreign lands, may not all be careful in our actions everywhere. Undoubtedly, our attitude is sometimes seen as arrogant, although we never intentionally mean to appear so; it is just how others perceive it. Our entire nation indeed has a tendency towards impatience and intolerance. If things do not start smoothly, we often become angry or frustrated, which may be very important now that China's post-war recovery is rather slow.</p>
<p>These words cannot include all the criticisms the Chinese have of Americans, but I hope I have at least shown that I have considered this aspect and that I do not view the Chinese with arrogance. I first arrived in what was then Beijing in 1924, and I have spent most of my time in China since then. After living here for so many years, I have had ample opportunity to see many things that should prompt criticism from myself and us Americans, while at the same time seeing that the Chinese are often content and satisfied. An average Chinese person enjoys much less than an average American, but is better at enjoying happiness.</p>
<p>Though Rich in Creativity, Poor at Managing Enterprises</p>
<p>If I were to say something about China from an American perspective, I could not help but admit that seeing the Chinese people's contentment sometimes makes me impatient. If the Chinese were more discontented, perhaps building a better China would be quicker. They accept things that could clearly be improved too easily. In my view, this is one of the things that urgently needs to change if China is to modernize.</p>
<p>Why are the Chinese so creative when inventing things but unable to promote those good enterprises? This is a question I have never been able to answer. Many good beginnings are to the credit of the Chinese, but they have not been able to sustain the original achievements. Take printing, for example. China was the first to know about printing, but this extremely important enterprise has not been made available to all the Chinese people, benefiting only a small number of highly educated individuals. Compared to other countries, the circulation of Chinese books, magazines, and newspapers still seems insufficient. We are told that many Chinese are too poor to afford books, which shows that printing has not been fully utilized. Printing is a tool for disseminating knowledge, and it will surely help China prosper in the future. China should have been able to do this centuries ago, but China has sat idly by, allowing this useful invention to become too specialized and eventually decline.</p>
<p>One of the Greatest Weaknesses - Inability to Employ Talent</p>
<p>China had an imperial examination system very early on, which was the earliest civil service system. However, this system also eventually declined and became useless. From an American perspective, one of the greatest weaknesses in China, whether in government or private enterprise, is the preference for relatives and friends and the inability to employ talent. Now they should return to the system that China itself once led.</p>
<p>China is mainly an agricultural country with the most farmers, and farmers are practical. The Chinese have historically been a practical people, which is why. However, I feel that in the current new environment, they seem somewhat less practical, especially in the industrial sector. Previously, Shanghai workers were often oppressed because many employers did not understand that if workers had shorter working hours, better meals, and higher wages, it would increase work efficiency, and the employers themselves would profit more. Now, we feel that there is an opposite trend. Workers often make demands on employers that the employers cannot realistically afford, and any explanation is disregarded as long as the workers believe it violates their interests. As a foreigner, I have heard that in some foreign-owned factories, workers demand extremely high wages from foreigners, saying that if the employers do not pay the wages, they should send some foreigners back. This is completely impractical; people come to foreign countries to do business, not to give money away. Missionaries come to do good deeds, which is different, and perhaps many Chinese people are somewhat confused. A better approach would be to compare foreign businessmen in China with Chinese businessmen abroad. Their main intention when going abroad is simply to do good business!</p>
<p>Which Path to Take - The Time for Choice is Now</p>
<p>Now, I want to mention a question that is of greatest concern to me right now. That is: is China preparing to take a strict nationalist path, or does it want to adopt a more internationally-oriented attitude? If the idea is "China for the Chinese," then it may be difficult to expect much help from other countries in the future. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is about to end, and most of the countries that donated materials seem to have an unfavorable impression of the practical results. Among these countries, the United States is in a leading position. Many Americans and others feel that the best way to help countries like China in the future is to treat such help as a business, rather than continuing to simply give things away. So, China must now choose; it cannot adopt a nationalist stance while simultaneously wanting to receive the materials it needs for its recovery.</p>
<p>Establishing Fair Treaties - Mutual Benefit for Both Countries</p>
<p>If China still wants help from other countries, it is to be expected that these other countries will demand certain benefits. I am not saying that they necessarily want any privileges that would harm China's sovereignty. In fact, there are no signs of such developments. Many Chinese people's attitude toward the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation really surprised the Americans. This is a traditional and conservative treaty, intended to establish fair provisions to be followed in Sino-American trade, aiming for mutual benefit for both countries. Many Americans believe that China would initially benefit more from this, as the United States has abundant resources and suffered relatively less damage during the war. However, several Chinese newspapers expressed doubt, saying that the intention of signing this trade agreement was a form of American aggression against China. However, no one has ever explained how this aggression could succeed. The United States has been "giving" more than "taking" in these years, and many believe that if China is to stand firm, the United States still needs to donate a great deal of wealth. However, it is painful to see that some Chinese people still harbor such doubts, because this kind of mentality can prompt the United States or other countries to withdraw from China and find other uses for their wealth.</p>
<p>Maintaining Cordial Mutual Trust - Controlling Trade Trends</p>
<p>From the position of an American, I do not want others to think I am too sensitive, and I am not afraid of others putting America's commercial plans to the most detailed examination to see if they are good or bad. I only hope that the United States and China can maintain the cordial mutual trust of the past, because this kind of ordinary psychological issue may have a considerable impact on controlling future trade trends. I hope that China can not only show that it trusts the United States, but also that China can see that it really needs to offer special incentives to make American capital and technology willing to come to China. The current China is not a place that is pleasant to invest in. The opportunities to lose money are many, this is a clear fact. The Chinese themselves also understand this point, because when they do business themselves, when lending a somewhat risky loan, they usually ask for a large interest rate first. Similarly, if you call on foreigners to invest in China, foreigners will naturally expect to receive better profits than in places where investment is safer. However, we cannot find the incentives that would make Americans come to China to take this risk. Not only do they see that there is not much opportunity to make money, but in fact, China's current laws do not allow them to remit the money they earn back to the United States. They are subject to many Chinese government regulations, such as regarding obtaining foreign exchange, import rights, and many, many other items, and these regulations are increasing daily. So, in this situation, we hardly see any new American or other foreign companies willing to take risks in China. Some people are continuing to operate companies established before the war, but they find it very difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Working Together - Hope for Revival</p>
<p>So, according to an American's view of China, I only feel quite lonely, except for the many personal friends I have known in these years. And these Chinese friends of mine are also suffering the same misfortune as American and other foreign companies. They often have to compete with government enterprises and are often constrained by various regulations. They are suffering from inflation. I sympathize with them very much, and I do not want to suggest any reforms that would put American interests in China above those of the Chinese. The current situation is a difficult moment for all of us. I only suggest that when dealing with China's various problems, the Chinese should, on the one hand, utilize the experience that foreigners already have, and combine this experience with all the good talents they possess. For example, we have discovered in America that too many regulations only hinder business. Recently, the United States was very short of meat, and someone suggested that President Truman control national ranches and confiscate privately owned livestock. He did not adopt this suggestion, but instead canceled all rationing limits. Of course, this had the adverse consequence of raising prices, but at least some meat appeared on the market, and the meat industry gradually flourished. I think the Chinese also respond better with less control. If someone can encourage Americans to come to China, and can make them feel welcome after they come to China, I think they can find many Chinese who are willing to work with them. As long as everyone can cooperate, China's commerce can be revived. Only after commerce can proceed quickly is there hope for restoring prosperity. The Chinese are the same as the Americans; only by restoring prosperity can they enjoy all the pleasures of life.</p>

<h3>Comedy Talk</h3>
<p>— Guan Yu</p>
<p>Since the performance of "Promotion Chart," comedies have been continuously staged. It is said to be a transitional period for spoken drama, using comedies to maintain this crisis. However, the reason why "Promotion Chart" was able to sell out was not entirely because it was a comedy, but because its content was closely related to the audience's lives and spoke the words that the audience wanted to say, thus creating its unprecedented box office record.</p>
<p>Although the eight-year War of Resistance was victorious, flames of war are still everywhere; in people's minds, everyone has a shadow. Therefore, "laughter" has become a spiritual need. However, meaningless "laughter" cannot dispel the darkness in people's minds; only "laughter" that speaks out the worries and sorrows in people's hearts is what people need.</p>
<p>The currently playing "Wedding March" and "Nepotism" are two comedies.</p>
<p>"Wedding March"</p>
<p>This describes single women who have not married cannot find housing, and married women cannot find jobs. Although the author uses a tragedy in the last act to end the play, he did not depart from the theme of the play.</p>
<p>Huang Ying is a young girl who is new to the world and full of hope for her future. She has bright ideals and rich fantasies, but the real society gives her disappointment and setbacks everywhere. This is not Huang Ying's fault, but the strange phenomena in society that are preventing her, deceiving her, and not letting her take the path she hopes for.</p>
<p>Many intellectual housewives had great plans during their school days, but after marriage and having children, these plans are all in vain. They intuitively place the responsibility for destroying their plans on marriage. Since watching this "Wedding March," they will see that the responsibility lies not in marriage, but in "social problems."</p>
<p>"Nepotism"</p>
<p>The author uses a satirical pen to ruthlessly draw this ugly picture, telling countless unemployed intellectual youths the reasons for their unemployment. He writes about officials using the nepotistic relationships of their wives as stepping stones to promotion and wealth; he also writes about using nepotistic relationships as a means of seeking employment and promotion. It is because these shameless officials employ people based on nepotistic relationships that talented and specialized personnel are unable to realize their ambitions.</p>
<p>It also incidentally writes about the stupidity of officials: acting as soon as they have a concept. So many jokes come out of it.</p>
<p>The actors in this play all perform well, but the actress playing Chen Baiqi often cannot help but laugh, which greatly disrupts the mood of the play.</p>
<h3>On the Missteps of Tianchan</h3>
<p>— Feng Chang</p>
<p>After Cheng and Tan's performances at the Tianchan Stage, Gao Shenglin took the lead, supported by Yuan Shihai and Yang Juping, and they have already taken the stage in recent days.</p>
<p>In fact, this decision-making plan is smart in its general outline. Mei Lanfang sells 20,000 at the "China" theater, Qilin Tong sells 12,000 at the "Golden" theater, and Gao Shenglin only sells 6,000—even more discounted than Qilin Tong. The Tianchan has many seats, so selling more at a lower profit can defeat Qilin Tong and not lose to Mei Lanfang.</p>
<p>However, they made missteps in the details, because they gave up Yan Shishan and replaced him with Yang Juping. Let's not talk about the benefits of Yan Shishan yet, and talk about the inappropriateness of Yang Juping.</p>
<p>First, Yang Juping lacks both the charm of a courtesan and the beauty. In terms of her appeal, she has long lost this point in Shanghai-style opera, let alone her Beijing-style opera? She can "Spin Cotton" and "Split the Coffin," but has never become "famous" for it. In terms of attracting audiences, she is even less capable. At the same time, she is Guo Yukun's wife. The "viewing" public is even less interested in her, unless Tianchan lets her dance a "Five Strips Dance" (one more strip than Wu Xiaolan) on stage every evening performance, perhaps she can still attract dozens of spectators. But this is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Second, regarding Yang Juping's singing, the fundamental skills and other descriptive terms of true Peking Opera art, I think it is best not to use them. The simplest sentence is that Yang Juping is in no way up to the current Tianchan lineup of Wei Lianfang on this point.</p>
<p>Third, perhaps one of the reasons Tianchan hired Yang Juping was to pair her with Gao Shenglin. What can she pair with him? The most common is nothing more than "Cui Ping Mountain" and "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian." Let me ask, in the case of these two plays, in today's Shanghai, does Gao Shenglin have a strong appeal when he sings? Or does Yang Juping have a strong appeal when she sings? Or do Gao and Yang together have a strong appeal when they sing? The answers to these three questions are naturally all "no." Just look at the opening night to know; Gao and Yang's "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" can only be sung as the final play, and a "Chain Scheme" is added behind it. From this, we can know that "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" is at most a "gift play" or "subsidiary play" in Gao Shenglin's appeal (I am not talking about his art here). Since this is the case, a play without appeal should save some money in terms of business, and also pay attention to matching in terms of art, so it is already sufficient to use Wei Lianfang, why bother hiring Yang Juping?</p>
<p>From the above three points, it seems that Yang Juping should not have been hired. Let's now talk about the benefits of Yan Shishan.</p>
<p>First, he has the best martial dan foundation (the number one martial role in both the north and south). In terms of art, he should be hired.</p>
<p>Second, he has an absolute appeal to the audience on the three floors and back rows of Tianchan. The Tianchan Stage has many and wide seats on the three floors and back rows. If Tianchan's prices are cheap, it also has a considerable appeal to the front-row audience. So, if Yan Shishan can be used well, there must be many people at the Tianchan gate buying tickets to see Yan Shishan.</p>
<p>Third, if his play is listed as the finale, he will definitely put in effort; the more effort he puts in, the more people will watch, regardless of whether they are in the front or back rows. Only when Gao and Yuan are on the same stage does he not have the opportunity to be listed as the finale. When other sheng and dan come, he is relegated to Ban Shichao's position, which loses the effectiveness of the land. So Yan Shishan should be used cleverly.</p>
<p>Also, when it comes to plays such as "Da Sizhou City" and "Yang Pai Feng," he also has a special appeal, and should be placed in the finale, with Gao Shenglin playing the monkey and Yang Liulang: it should be a smarter way for stars to support stars. Moreover, to make Yan Shishan more appealing, and to make Yan Shishan's plays sell more, only when Gao and Yuan cooperate, because Gao Shenglin is willing to play a supporting role today. In a few days, when he becomes popular, he may not be willing. All famous and unique works should use the method of listing them as the finale to promote him, so as to reveal the most artistic aspect of the play.</p>
<p>Previously, when Li Wanchun and Mao Shilai were on the same stage, this method was used. Li played Huangfu Gang in Mao Shilai's signature play "Da Ying Jielie," and only received unanimous praise; no one said that Li Wanchun had lowered his status.</p>
<p>Naturally, Gao Shenglin is also willing to play a supporting role, and should also play a supporting role, as long as Yan Shishan has true art.</p>
<h3>Finding Character Personas</h3>
<p>— Gao Heng</p>
<p>Typical Creation: A "typical" character is one who, due to specific economic conditions, professional lives, etc., is grouped together with others in society. For example: groups of farmers, groups of workers, groups of merchants... Within each group, because of the similarities in their professions, lives, habits, etc., there are commonalities in their speech, actions, and even skin and clothing. These all represent the characteristics of their group, and these characteristics are the best material for authors. At this point, the embryo of creation is the "typical" character.</p>
<p>Individual Creation: In addition to the characteristics shared by each character with their own social class, their unique background, age, strengths, weaknesses, temperament, etc., produce their individual actions, language, and temperament. Therefore, besides creating typical characters within a group, an author must dig deep into the unique aspects of each character.</p>
<p>External Creation: Humanity has a vast variety of types: tall and short, fat and thin, kind and cruel, handsome and ugly... And in terms of manners and habits of action, each is unique. Robbers have the appearance of robbers, petty thieves have the behavior of petty thieves, hypocrites have the attitude of gentlemen, enchanting women have the allure of enchanting women, and gentle ladies have the tranquility of gentle ladies. Therefore, if you want to make your character leave a deep impression on the reader, you must also pay attention to the external creation of your character.</p>
<p>Internal Creation: It is not enough for an author to only focus on the external appearance of a character; they must go further and pay attention to the inner life of the character. A person's external behavior and speech must be rooted in their inner thoughts and emotions. The inner emotions of a melancholy woman and a joyful wealthy merchant are fundamentally different. Similarly, two farmers may both be thin, but their experiences are different, so their inner expressions will never be the same. A character with only external form is just a shell; only with an inner life does it have a soul.</p>
<h3>About Kunqu Opera</h3>
<p>— Xiang Peiliang</p>
<p>(Editor's Note): This is a letter from Mr. Xiang Peiliang, discussing Mr. Xuanlu's article "Observations on the Rise and Fall of Kunqu Opera" published in this journal on December 15th of last year. The editor has published a section of the letter related to the article as an academic discussion.</p>
<p>Mr. Xuanlu's article "Observations on the Rise and Fall of Kunqu Opera" was partially deleted by the editor due to space constraints. For example, in point five raised by Mr. Xiang Peiliang, Mr. Xuanlu added an explanation in parentheses after "several acts," namely the words "several songs," which were deleted by the editor. We sincerely apologize! My knowledge of this field is quite lacking, but I can point out that Mr. Xuanlu's writing has errors in almost every section.</p>
<p>1.  There is a great distance between the Chu Ci (Songs of Chu) and the Han and Wei Yuefu (Music Bureau poetry). The so-called Chu songs are not included in the Chu Ci. Early Western Han Dynasty Yuefu, such as the Fangzhong Ge (Songs of the Chamber), suburban sacrifices, and Naoge (Military Songs), have no origin in four-character poems. How can one broadly say: "It repeatedly changed and became the Han and Wei Yuefu?"</p>
<p>2.  "Song Ci evolved into Yuan Qu (Yuan Dynasty Songs)" I don't know what the basis for this is. Qu such as Guzici, Zhuantata, and Liling existed as early as the early Northern Song Dynasty.</p>
<p>3.  There are many documents on the Canguan Huanghu Xi (Adjutant Huanghu Play), so how can one say: "What the content is like, there is no way to verify?"</p>
<p>4.  Qu includes Ju Qu (Dramatic Songs) and San Qu (Aria Songs). San Qu is not in the third-person form. The Yuan and Ming Dynasty authors were very prosperous, so how can one say: "Qu is in the third-person form, with lyrics and dialogue?" Lyrics are Qu, dialogue is not Qu.</p>
<p>5.  "Each play is divided into several acts" I don't know what kind of Chinese drama this is (except for spoken drama).</p>
<p>6.  "The Kunqu Opera that is now transmitted is no longer a return to Yuan Qu" I don't know what this is saying. The Kun character in Kunqu refers to a type of singing style, not a dramatic genre, so it cannot be compared with Yuan Qu at all.</p>
<p>7.  "Although the Ming people wanted to restore the ancient, they could not escape its clichés. Therefore, Qu has a distinction between North and South." I don't know that South Qu actually predates North Qu. Southern Song Yongjia Zaju, also known as Xiwens, developed before Yuan Qu; why did it only become "divided into North and South" in the Ming Dynasty? Even the Pipa Ji (Lute Song), which Mr. Xuanlu considers to be its pioneer, was written before the end of the Yuan Dynasty.</p>
<p>8.  "Zaju is called North Qu, and its system mostly imitates the works left by the Yuan people." I don't know what else "Yuan people's works" are called if not Zaju?</p>
<p>9.  "Chuanqi is called South Qu, and Gao Zecheng's Pipa Ji opened its pioneer, followed by Jing Liu Bai Sha in the early Ming Dynasty." These few sentences have made two major mistakes. There are many extant catalogs of South Qu (Xiwens). There are also three types of Southern Song works passed down, such as Xiaosun Tu. The four types of Jing Liu Bai Sha, except for Chugui Ji (Bai Yue Ting), were all before the Pipa Ji, that is, before the establishment of the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>Alright, I've already written nine points, no need to write any further, in our country, nine is considered the extreme number, so no need to write ten points; but what I've recorded is less than a third of the original text!</p>
<h3>A Protagonist of "Nepotism": Feng Zhe</h3>
<h3>The Nature of Light</h3>
<p>— Wenquan</p>
<p>More than two thousand years ago, Aristotle explained the nature of light, saying: a luminous body is the starting point of motion, and generates waves in the "medium" around it, gradually spreading farther and farther until it reaches the human eye. Newton initially did not believe this either. In 1678 AD, the Dutchman Huygens also reiterated this theory. Later, the Englishman Young and the Frenchman Fresnel elaborated in detail and explained all optical phenomena, and only then did the current conclusion arise.</p>
<p>The occurrence of light may be due to electricity or chemistry, but the most important and common reason is that the body heats up and everything rises together. Heat is essentially the rapid vibration of matter. This movement waves to the surrounding medium, forming radiating ripples. Like a stone thrown into water, ripples rise suddenly. The faster the movement, the higher the heat, the shorter the wavelength, and the human eye sees its light, from orange to yellow to pure white. Depending on the wavelength of that light, the color perception varies.</p>
<p>Usually, when light travels to the boundary surface of a second medium, it must reflect a part of it, which is the reflection of light. If the light-receiving surface is extremely smooth, like a mirror or water, the measured reflection is also very regular. That is, how large the angle of incidence is, how large the angle of reflection is. If the light-receiving surface is slightly uneven, the direction of reflection is not specified. Because of this irregular reflection, we can get so many conveniences in our lives. For example, even if no sunlight enters the room, it is reflected by the blue sky, and then reflected by the floating dust, and all object surfaces reflect in a complicated way, still maintaining an appropriate brightness, and all objects are not black shadows, but rely on this to fully reveal their shapes.</p>
<p>The larger the angle of incidence of the object surface reflection, the stronger the reflection amount. When light shines perpendicularly on the water surface, the reflected light is 18 per thousand; when it is 30 degrees, it is still only 19 per thousand; at 80 degrees, it reflects 333 per thousand, and at 90 degrees, it reflects 721 per thousand. When we are by the sea, we see the nearby area as blue, but the distance is blurred; also, the shadows of trees in the river are clear nearby but blurred in the distance. These all belong to the same principle.</p>
<p>When light rays pass through the second medium, their direction must be slightly refracted, which is the refraction of light. With this physics of refraction, we can use a prism to disperse white light and obtain a color band of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Let us know that the above pigments are related to the three primary colors of red, green, and blue. The morning dew reflects the sun and emits strange colors, and the sky is blue after the rain, and there is also a rainbow. Even the spray and flowing waves become a mystery of different colors, which is broken through by this. It turns out that it is the action of water droplets in the air separating light.</p>
<p>In addition to the light separation effect, light can also be separated by microscopic particles and molecules in space, and transformed into various colored lights. For example, if you drop milk into water and mix it, it becomes turbid, and if you then shine light on it, you will see that the surface of the water is slightly bluish, and the bottom of the cup is slightly orange-yellow. This principle is that the longer red, orange, and yellow colors in the light wave do not conflict with the smaller particles, but pass by peacefully, while the shorter blue and purple are blocked and folded back. Also, if cooking smoke is set off by village houses and trees, it is dark and blue. If it is supported by outer space, it will be warm and yellow. This is also the light separation effect of carbon particles in the smoke. Similarly, when the night air is turbid, or there is fog, the light seen from a distance is red, gradually becomes orange as it gets closer, and becomes yellow as it gets closer. Therefore, it is difficult to see pure colors in distant scenes, and they are diluted by the microscopic particle separation. In American dance stages and color movies, microscopic particles are often sprayed under colored lights to exchange for the illusion of colored mist. And what can be found on our country's stage is only extremely unsanitary dust.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt</h3>
<p>— Xinfang</p>
<p>Who Plays This Great Statesman?</p>
<p>The late American President Roosevelt dedicated his life to seeking world peace. His deeds will of course be immortal in world history. Hollywood companies in the United States had long had plans to put this world-renowned great man on the screen, but the reason why it has not been realized until now is, on the one hand, because it cannot be done hastily; on the other hand, it is because it is not easy to find a suitable and competent actor to play this "Roosevelt" on the screen. It is said that Lyon Barrymore was initially selected; but it was abandoned due to the resolute opposition of Mrs. Roosevelt. Her reason for disagreement was that when her husband ran for the last presidential election, Lyon Barrymore was on the side of the opposition party. The MGM company in Hollywood finally selected a British actor residing in New York to take on the role, Todfrey Tearle. Whether in appearance or posture, he looks very much like Roosevelt. According to public opinion from all walks of life, it is believed that he will definitely be able to satisfy the role. Mrs. Roosevelt also did not object; but she requested that the film company pay attention to not shooting the "Roosevelt" on the screen head-on, but shooting it at a three-quarter angle would be best. The company accepted her suggestion. Finally, this great biographical film is now named (The Begiming &amp; the End). Although Mr. Roosevelt is dead, his spirit is immortal, and his career is worthy of admiration by future generations, so this naming is also very well chosen!</p>
<h3>New Film Ramblings</h3>
<p>— Ma Boliang</p>
<p>"The Pirate"</p>
<p>Charles Laughton's More Than Ample Acting Skills</p>
<p>It was that string of the same shadows that enveloped him: cruel, vicious, mean, cunning, insidious, and hypocritical. This pirate leader is not much different from other pirate leaders. There is only one difference: he wants to be an aristocrat, a gentleman, and tries to get rid of his superficial rudeness everywhere, without the straightforward recklessness and uninhibitedness of Pan Zhuoweila in "Long Live Freedom." So he is not a hero, and a huge shadow sweeps across his life, and Captain Kidd is finished. This character is quite common, not as fleshy as Pan Zhuoweila. There is not a single spark of humanity here. If we list it as the best New Year's play, it is still because of the adventurous curiosity hidden in our childhood. The director followed the intention of the screenwriter, and did not use climaxes, but only introduced it in an orderly manner, scene by scene, which can be regarded as neat and tidy. The most striking thing is the black register, with names crossed out one after another. It is a pity that the director did not add a trick, let others add and then cross out Kidd's name, otherwise it would be even more powerful.</p>
<p>Kidd's personality is so special that Charles Laughton finds it really easy to play, but it is too easy, so there is no majestic and strange place in the depiction, it is just competent. Randolph Scott's Macy and Barbara Britton's Annie are purely supporting roles, embellishments. Randolph is still conservative and stereotyped, and Barbara is not as good as the refined nun in "Virginia." On the other hand, the other supporting actors are very good. Leitchino Owen's "gentleman's gentleman," the long-faced man playing the pirate leader Pffe, and the one playing the pirate leader Lorenzo, are all colorful.</p>
<p>Colorful Phoenix Sings</p>
<p>Joan Leslie, the Successor to Deanna Durbin</p>
<p>Girlish stars with a charming and coquettish style are still popular, but those who liked Deanna Durbin in junior high school are now beginning to prefer the new style of Joan Leslie. Deanna Durbin, Diana Barrymore, and Donna Reed, the sparks of Deanna Durbin are gradually extinguished, and we have now lost our past expectations for her and no longer dream of her fat face. "Where Do We Go from Here?" has a comedy style, and Deanna is still considerable, but in "Lady on a Train" and "Christmas Holiday" she has already become mediocre. The five colors of "Colorful Phoenix Sings" cannot save her either. Her face is not suitable for color, and it is more graceful and lovely in black and white films. Director Robert Lynen is just a junior after all, unable to use the camera, and the introduction of the story is extremely flat. The screenwriter's handling of the subject matter has only one unconventional point, that is, after taking a bath, he sings to the girl in the room next door, mistaking her for an old woman, and turning the story around a corner. Jerome Kern's composition is still pleasant to listen to, so Deanna sings on the carriage, light and free, the male lead Robert Benchley is mediocre, and this pair of treasures, Akim Tamiroff, although they are clowns, are not annoying.</p>
<p>I just like one scene of it, just like I love this musical film "Meet Me in St. Louis." That is when the flowers and trees are luxuriant, and the sun comes to play in the mountains and fields. Deanna, wearing a white shirt, is surprised by the beautiful natural scenery and can't help but sing out loud. When we arrive in a place with beautiful mountains and clear waters, we often have the feeling of singing freely, and Deanna's singing is exactly what we have in mind. Secondly, in a love song by the stream, there is indeed a light of love on Deanna's face. It is the only remaining bud of her past glory, and it is youth shining beautifully.</p>
<p>Double Phoenix Fate</p>
<p>The Screen Lacks Five Colors, and Marie Monteil Loses Color.</p>
<p>The black dance fan is half-covered, the black dance shirt flutters, and the black starry eyes are vaguely opened. Marie Monteil is a little alive, not an idol like a princess in a fairy tale world, but without five colors, Marie feels diminished. The too long face and unattractive new clothes, we regret Marie Monteil's stagnant eyes. Leaf Fengdai Carlo really won. "Double Phoenix Fate" is several times more dilapidated than "Salome," scattered and sparse. As a detective film, it is not tense, mysterious, has no atmosphere, and no climax. Only the scene where Louis Hayward forcibly drags the police sergeant down the elevator to perish together is more powerful. Compared to "The Bribe," "Double Phoenix Fate" is really bad. This cannot be blamed on Marie Monteil. The director, screenwriter, and producer cannot escape the blame. For example, the role of Sapo is completely redundant and annoying!</p>
<p>Harem Soul</p>
<p>"All the King's Men" pulls back the black curtain of the Arab harem. The slim and plump, the warblers and swallows, are really beautiful. Marlene Dietrich's erotic dance is deeply seductive. Secondly, let's talk about "A Thousand and One Nights," there are also many concubines in the harem competing for beauty. "Harem Soul" does not have these confusing scenes, there are no beautiful women, and no pleasant songs and dances. James Tinling is worthy of his name, but he is also powerless, and Marilyn Maxwell is only beautiful. Leaving these aside, Albert S. Rogell's gimmicks are still many. Just talking about being hilarious, although not as good as "Charley's Aunt," it is also acceptable. That's all. Hollywood's slapstick comedy is at a crossroads, I don't know where to go.</p>

<h3>Rambling Talk about Cursive Script</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenlü</p>
<p>"Characters like earthworms are dragons and snakes, everyone says that Celestial Master Zhang is their ancestor. I also have no other way to turn copper into gold, just塗(tu) up with ink and exchange for white blossoms." This is a short poem that I wrote in front of my fee schedule in previous years, because a colleague jokingly called my calligraphy as Celestial Master Zhang's drawing of talismans. Indeed, cursive script is written continuously, and it looks like a talisman. It is a fact that it is not easy for everyone to recognize and is difficult to be widely used. Most of the cursive characters written by ordinary people are sloppy and disrespectful, and each person just writes their own cursive style.</p>
<p>To give an example: Even a wise man like Mr. Lin Yutang once published my "Rambling Talk about Cursive Painting" (signed Zhang Huang) in his edited "This Human World." All the titles, catalogs, and various newspaper advertisements were all transformed into "Cursive Script Theory." It was clearly miscellaneous essays, but it was transformed into a solemn theory, probably because the second "cursive" character I wrote was too cursive and was mistaken.</p>
<p>As a cursive script lover like me, I also hope that cursive script will become popular. But the cursive script that everyone uses is mostly mixed with broken characters, lowercase, simplified characters, and even the writing style of account books. The regular cursive script of "Shrimp and Egg Fried Rice" is far less convenient than "Shrimp and Egg Fried Rice" under the busy pen of a restaurant's ledger, and is familiar to diners. The fancy names on pawn tickets are habitually written in cursive, and ordinary people are stunned and don't know what to say. The Ministry of Education once promoted standard simplified characters, but immediately withdrew its order. Today's wise men advocate cursive script to save time, and I absolutely express my admiration, considering it a superior statement.</p>
<p>From an artistic point of view, calligraphy is originally a unique art in our country, and cursive script undoubtedly occupies the best of all calligraphy. Since cursive script is more in line with the principles of painting, the aesthetic conditions are also more complete. Without great artistic talent and the skills of learning and cultivation, how can one write a beautiful cursive script work? Therefore, cursive script is a matter for artists, and they can devote their lives to it. What we must first advocate is how to increase everyone's interest in cursive script.</p>
<p>The ancients said: "Regular script is like sitting, running script is like walking, and cursive script is like running." It is true that cursive script should be written quickly like running, but this only indicates a part of it. There are many ways to write a cursive character, and it must be adapted to local conditions. The size and density between characters should be matched, and the encroachment and concession between lines should be carefully considered. It is not enough to just run. Moreover, the posture of cursive script is either unrestrained like river waves, or firm like mountains, or flowing like gossamer, or ancient and clumsy like mottled moss stones. It is indeed that the intention arrives and the pen follows, with no doubt or stagnation, and the twists and turns, and the bone strength are sought to be complete, which cannot be exhausted by just running. Thinking that Zhang Xu's cursive script improved after watching a sword dance, and Wen Yuke realized the principles of cursive script after seeing snake fights, both have nothing to do with running. I think it is better to say: "Regular script is like sitting, running script is like walking, and cursive script is like dancing."</p>
<p>Su Shi felt that the air of wine was coming from between his ten fingers after writing cursive script after drinking. Huaisu's autobiography said: I write two or three lines at will when drunk, but I can't collect the book after waking up. The divine strokes are mostly produced in a state of intoxication, which is common among literati and artists, not only cursive script masters.</p>
<p>Although cursive script masters are not born every generation, if we take the norms of the predecessors and develop our own ingenuity, we should get modern people who are better than the ancients. Why are there so few cursive script talents in recent times? And people in Japan are studying and researching it more and more. They have extensively collected and printed our country's calligraphy, painting, and inscriptions, doing their best to collect and extensively learn, and there is a great trend of cursive style spreading eastward. Looking at it this way, we might as well not ask for outstanding cursive script masters, but make it an urgent task to improve the intellectual level of ordinary compatriots.</p>
<h3>On the Lake —Third Notes of a Trip to Yunnan—</h3>
<p>— Lin Yongquan</p>
<p>It's autumn.</p>
<p>The flat rice grains all bow their heads because of the burden of their abundant fruits. Their faded and residual yellow clothes are torn by the autumn wind in a chaotic manner, and some are lying together. Some green and vibrant Chen dreams; the sound of gurgling raindrops playing in the rice paddies when they were young, and the scene of dragonflies hovering and looking around, can only be recalled in the old age of this species.</p>
<p>The stone lion sitting in Sanpai Fang is now moved to the front of Kunhu Elementary School. In the past, it overlooked the pedestrians on the street and seemed to be an inanimate object cheering for the one or two officials who called themselves "kings" at that time. Now, it can only squat at the low doorway, allowing the children who are just beginning to know things to play with and mock it. The changes of the times are like this, will the changes of thought also be like this? We don't know if there will be children who want to ride the lion and become kings in the future?</p>
<p>When I arrived at the gate of Daguanlou, it was still quiet. Perhaps because it was not a holiday, there were almost no tourists. Some were just one or two couples talking affectionately, who were unwilling to socialize with others and specially chose a quiet place to whisper and prepare for some possible developments. There were also young men and women who were hurrying to take a small boat, making aquatic dreams and looking for another kind of warm affection. Tang Jiyao's equestrian bronze statue; the long couplet of the Qimen; the tigers, leopards, peacocks, apes, and black bears in the zoo; as well as all the arrangements and buildings, and all the flowers and plants, were not noticed by them.</p>
<p>The grassy sea near the building is often the destination of tourists, and mostly because they can take a boat there, in order to taste the taste of "setting sail" and "riding the wind and waves" in this vast sea—Yunnan people call Dianchi Lake the sea. A dozen small sampans were parked under the willow shade of a small pier that had not been specially built, quietly waiting for customers, and their owners were soliciting business on the narrow road by the lake. The lonely lakeside was often disturbed by the arguing over prices.</p>
<p>When on the lake, the calm lake water was wrinkled by the casual and inadvertent breeze. Also, because of the boat's propulsion, there were always two slightly curled locks of hair separating on both sides of the bottom of the boat. Sometimes the wind blew stronger, and all the water surface was laughing passionately. Like a group of playful children, holding on to each other and hugging each other; forming a wall, forming a long embankment. But then it collapsed and fell into a pot-shaped round bottom, and the complicated laughter had a temporary respite. But the arms of those who came later continued to rush up, and the chuckling laughter seemed to never end.</p>
<p>These boats, these pieces of wood that often hoisted a small sail, were always drifting silently on this lake, and even attracted those white gulls that were always bathing their white feathers. Sometimes they circled above the bottom of the lake; sometimes they kissed the clear face of the bottom of the lake. The lonely lake water, the lonely boat, and the lonely distant mountains, and the lonely village on the lake shore; all seemed to show joy, liveliness, happiness, and peace because of their comfortable game.</p>
<p>The lake water rises and falls with the seasons; the lake shore and the distant mountains wither and flourish, and become desolate and familiar with the seasons. But the lonely, unchanging boats are forever moored on the lake shore and drifting on the lake. Even though they also have irregular reproduction and death, new manufacturing and destruction, we, who are transient passers-by touring the lake, cannot think of these things.</p>
<p>Gradually it was dusk, and the evening wind on the lake became urgent. From afar, the faint returning sails floated towards the building and gathered towards the misty bay of tall trees and long bamboo. The quiet lakeside was lit with stars of fishing fire.</p>
<h3>The Finger Painting Artist, Teng Baiye</h3>
<p>— Xu Shiqi</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, when I lived in Nanjing, art enthusiasts organized a painting and calligraphy society named "Hui She." We met twice a week to discuss and learn from each other, which was immensely enjoyable. The friends in the society were all outstanding talents of the time. Mr. Teng Baiye was renowned in artistic circles for his versatility and skill in creating finger paintings and calligraphy. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, the national government moved west, and the members dispersed. Baiye went far to Guilin, where he absorbed the beauty of the southwestern mountains and rivers. Although he endured many hardships, his understanding broadened, and his art became more refined, largely due to the help of nature. After the victory, we met again in the wartime capital, Chongqing. Surviving the war felt like another lifetime. Then we met again in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Baiye grew up in Jiangnan and was known as a child prodigy. He had great artistic talent and excelled in various forms of visual arts, such as sculpture, painting, and architecture. However, he was particularly skilled in finger painting. He could create landscapes, flowers, and birds with a single stroke, completing as many as a dozen or twenty paintings a day with such speed. Years ago, he studied in America, attending Harvard University. His exhibited works received great acclaim. After returning to China, he taught Chinese art history at Yenching University in Peiping.</p>
<p>In addition to his painting skills, Baiye was also highly skilled in sculpture. His works were displayed in national art exhibitions and admired by connoisseurs. In the spring of 1937, the capital city proposed erecting a bronze statue of the founding father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, in Xinjiekou Square. Designs and models were collected from artists nationwide, and leading figures in the party and state anonymously voted to select the winner. Baiye was chosen as the top candidate. However, as preparations were underway, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident broke out, engulfing the entire country, and the project was halted. Now, with the victory of the War of Resistance, it is hoped that the project can be revived, his plan realized, and the work completed, leaving a lasting memorial in the capital.</p>
<p>This exhibition features over a hundred recent finger paintings, including the richness of peonies, the elegance of bamboo and rocks, the secluded beauty of cloud-covered peaks and waterfalls, and the vigorous strength of wisteria. The works are vivid, like living beings, full of natural life, and create a new style in Chinese painting, making them highly valuable. The Qing Dynasty painter Gao Qipei, styled Qieyuan, from Liaoyang, was skilled in poetry and finger painting. He was adept at painting figures, flowers, trees, fish, dragons, birds, and animals, fully mastering the art. While Baiye was influenced by him, he has truly surpassed his predecessor. Connoisseurs who see his work will surely believe that my words are not exaggerated.</p>
<h3>Painting of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers</h3>
<p>— Xu Bangda</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Bangda is skilled in poetry and painting, and his calligraphy is also exquisite. He has a rich collection, studying and learning without blindly imitating, allowing his natural talent to shine. He is now acceding to the request of fellow enthusiasts by holding a solo exhibition for a week. The above image is one of the exhibited works, with its free and elegant brushwork, mellow and rich artistic flavor, and profound and refreshing artistic conception, both vast and charming.

<h3>Reading Notes on Hou Xiang's Paintings</h3>
<p>— Yang Kailing</p>
<p>Life is but a few decades. To prolong it, one must rely on external forces; otherwise, one will decay like grass and trees. The means to pass down one's legacy include achievements, writings, or remarkable and exceptional actions. Therefore, talented artists strive to learn, not caring whether their names are remembered, but hoping that their actions will be outstanding in their time. They exhaust their minds and hearts, enduring hardship, to pursue boundless knowledge with their limited lives, relishing the bitterness like sweetness.</p>
<p>Mr. Hou Xiang, styled Huahua, is from Dongli, Wuxi. His family, starting with Qi Zhuweng in the early Ming Dynasty, became known for their literary and political achievements, and the prosperity of scholars and officials continued for fourteen generations. Mr. Hou's ancestors and father were all skilled in poetry and painting, deeply influenced by the family's scholarly traditions. From a young age, he immersed himself in the study of classics, history, and literature. His parallel prose already amazed his elders. Later, he joined the army, traveling through Yan, Qi, Wu, and Yue. However, his proud nature prevented him from pandering to others. He returned to his hometown on foot and devoted himself to reading and studying, often staying up all night. After the age of twenty, he began studying painting with Mr. Ding Yunxuan, learning from Lin Liang, Zhou Zhimian, Yun Nantian, and Jiang Nansha, eventually reaching the level of Hua Xinluo. Therefore, his brushwork is ancient and elegant, and his compositions are deep and stable. Renowned figures such as Qiu Kefu and Wu Zhihui have praised him. Recently, Mr. Wu Zhihui and Mr. Ding Fubao selected over fifty of his works and exhibited them at the Yunlin Painting and Calligraphy Society on Rue Lupan and Rue Paul Beau for seven days. Among them are over twenty works of flowers, birds, insects, and fish, with powerful and profound brushwork and ancient and secluded colors, blending the styles of Baiyang and Xinluo into one. His occasional small poems are reminiscent of the late Tang Dynasty and Lu You's style, with elegant rhymes and careful adherence to meter, truly establishing him as a master. The over ten figure paintings, especially the paintings of children playing, celebrating the Lantern Festival, and carrying dragon lanterns, are full of natural charm, without any worldly or historical airs. His calligraphy follows the styles of the two Wangs, with Wen Zhengming and Wang Yayi as his models. The over ten landscape paintings are mostly in the style of Huang He Shanqiao, with layered mountains and peaks, emerald cliffs and green peaks, and a misty and moist atmosphere, following the ancients without being constrained by them. Other works, such as his copies of Shi Xi and Shi Tao, all reveal unique and captivating scenery. The two handscrolls, one copying Shen Zhou's landscape and the other Zhou Zhimian's flowers, transform their original styles, with a simple, unadorned, and honest air, deeply capturing the essence of the ancient masters. After quickly reading this several times, I jumped for joy and praised him.</p>
<p>Since the national crisis, Mr. Hou has secluded himself for ten years, using poetry, painting, and calligraphy to express himself. From morning to night, he took out his treasured collection, studying and imitating them, like a hermit in the mountains. Even the cries of his children, the cold, the sounds of airplanes, and the terrifying bombings did not disturb him. Later, he traveled to the outskirts of Cheng and Xi, to the shores of the Yangtze River and Taihu Lake, capturing the ever-changing smoke and clouds and the vast waves with his brush. Therefore, he can transform the unpredictable and reveal the secrets of nature. Now, Mr. Wu Zhihui, at the age of eighty-two, personally inscribed his works, greatly encouraging future scholars. The peonies and green leaves complement each other, making Mr. Hou deeply grateful and further encouraging him to strive in his art to live up to the expectations of his predecessors.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 138</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>There was no one to relay messages, no one to lead the way. Hejian could only follow the small path taken by that monocled gentleman, crossing the garden. Everything was exactly the same as the previous visit. Hejian felt that the guard at the entrance of Beppu's residence was the same old friend from the previous night. Hejian had a good memory, having received special training, so he was sure he wasn't mistaken.</p>
<p>"How can things be so coincidental?" Hejian thought to himself. The tranquility on the road outside Beppu's residence, the calmness within, and the same guard at his post made Hejian feel somewhat suspicious and strange. According to the investigation, there were more than twenty guards stationed at Beppu's residence. Due to the "isolation" policy, these guards must be rotated daily. Hejian's two visits were only two days apart. How could he have been assigned the same person again? Although the matter was small, it was a noteworthy issue in the eyes of an intelligence operative.</p>
<p>Hejian nodded at the guard and was about to ask a question when he heard footsteps from inside the hall. Under the dim light, someone hurried out.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Mr. Hejian." It was Beppu's secretary again.</p>
<p>"Good evening... Good evening, sir," Hejian had not inquired about his name and could only offer a vague greeting.</p>
<p>"Pardon my tardiness," the secretary said, gesturing an invitation. He turned and walked ahead, passing the door of the waiting room from the previous visit. He didn't stop but turned a corner and led Hejian into a larger reception room. This reception room was not only twice the size of the previous waiting room, but it was also decorated in a completely Western style, quite luxurious, likely used to entertain foreign guests and confidants.</p>
<p>"Please, sit wherever you like, Mr. Hejian," the secretary's attitude was much friendlier than the first time, as if he were entertaining a friend. "The minister is currently busy with official duties. He will not be free for at least half an hour. When it's time for your audience, I will naturally come and invite you... If you have any documents, please hand them over first..." He then offered a slight bow.</p>
<p>"Regarding the documents, I have a letter here from the General Staff Headquarters' Secretariat, ordering me to present it," Hejian said, handing the document to the secretary with both hands.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your trouble, please make yourself comfortable." The secretary took the document and was about to leave, but he saw that Hejian seemed to have something more to say, so he stopped.</p>
<p>"I was negligent last time and didn't inquire about your name. I apologize." Hejian said, also giving a bow.</p>
<p>"Nishihara Hisaji. I dare not ask for instruction. I hope you will enlighten me." He said, returning a bow, adhering to the saying, "More courtesy is never wrong."</p>
<p>"Mr. Nishihara." Hejian quickly took out a cigarette, preparing to launch his offensive. "I know you are very busy. I have a few questions I would like to ask. I wonder if you would be willing to spare a minute or two?"</p>
<p>"Thank you. I am not a fan of cigarettes or alcohol!" Nishihara refused Hejian's cigarette. "I dare not give instruction. I am willing to explain anything within my duties. As for other matters, I am very foolish and understand nothing."</p>
<p>To pry even a few secrets from a Japanese person's mouth is equivalent to hoping for a mute to sing, absolutely impossible. Unless this fellow is a drunkard, perhaps one could get something out of him after he's drunk. But Hejian wanted to try his luck with his clever skills.</p>
<p>"The military affairs on the mainland are very busy. You know that," Hejian said, looking at his watch. "It's already 10:30. According to my calculations, I should already be flying over the strait. But in fact, I'm still standing in Tokyo. Perhaps you can shed some light on this matter?"</p>
<p>"Ah,... um... oh,... yes..." This was Nishihara's reply.</p>
<p>"It's 10:30 now," Hejian refused to give up and launched another offensive. "You said the minister will be busy for at least another half an hour. If I calculate correctly, I probably won't be able to see him until after 11:00?"</p>
<p>"Half an hour is just an estimated guess," the mute finally spoke. "That's what the minister said. I can only relay his instructions. Other than that, I probably don't know anything." He said, giving another half-bow, formally turning around, exiting the room, and closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>"Half an hour?... Humph!" Hejian watched the fellow leave, thinking to himself. "Wait and see, I don't think it will take half an hour, unless my plan completely fails!" With a sneer, he chose a large single sofa, sat down comfortably, leaned back, assumed a half-sleeping position, looked up at the chandelier hanging in the center of the room, and took several deep drags of his cigarette.</p>

<h3>Public Buses</h3>
<p>— Shaofu</p>
<p>Since the launch of the public bus management office, the main transportation in the city has become much more convenient, and the citizens have benefited greatly. This is worth praising.</p>
<p>However, we have some opinions regarding the route issue. Take Route 7 as an example, from Zhongzheng Park to Zhabei Road Bridge, passing through Avenues Foch, and Jiaxing Road, etc. This avoids conflicts with trolley Routes 1 and 2, which is a good design, but why does it stop at Zhabei Road Bridge? Why not cross the bridge to the Bund on Beijing Road, or Renji Road on Yuanyuanmingyuan Road? Because crossing the bridge would provide more convenience for the citizens in the Hongkou area. It would also reduce the congestion of trolley Route 1.</p>
<p>Many people have this opinion, and we hope that the management office can consider improvements.</p>
<p>Secondly, Route 10 runs from Jing'an Temple to the Bund. On this route, there are trolley Routes 1 and 2, especially Route 2, which is particularly frequent. Therefore, most people advocate avoiding the same routes as the above two trolley routes, while the starting and ending points can remain the same. There are also too many vehicles on Nanjing Road, which can also reduce traffic congestion.</p>
<p>We wonder if the management office can also consider this point?</p>
<h3>Starting with the Price-Revised Stamps</h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>"All stamps are revised in price, and without revision, there is no increase."</p>
<p>It should be a pleasant thing to receive some mail every day. Even now, I often look forward to letters and printed materials from afar, like waiting for a love letter in first love. But this joy sometimes only "flashes in the pan" and disappears. Because I often receive express airmail that is slower than regular mail, and special issues of newspapers from other places for the Double Ten Festival and the Premier's birthday surprisingly arrive together on the same day!</p>
<p>I started "collecting stamps" at the age of six and have continued to collect them every day for more than twenty years. Although my stamp albums have been lost several times, I have still been "building a home from scratch" as much as possible in the past two years. Perhaps this is a person's hobby. To outsiders, what's the point of collecting a few stamps from domestic letters? But I think there is some meaning in it, or rather, some big problems can be revealed in these stamps.</p>
<p>In the "terminology" of "stamp collecting," there is something called "price-revised stamps," which refers to those whose face value when used is different from the original. Stamp collectors regard "price-revised stamps" as a new version and collect them as well, and they are often more expensive than the original stamps. Recently, what I have seen in the mail I received are these "price-revised stamps."</p>
<p>I remember that in my lost stamp albums, there were "price-revised stamps" during the reign of Empress Dowager Cixi, with the imprinted lead characters seeming to be "temporarily used as one cent in silver dollars." There were also "price-revised stamps" in the early years of the Republic of China, the first of which seemed to be three cents revised to two cents. Afterwards, there were more, but they always revised larger values to smaller ones, seemingly to counterfeit and cheat. Each issue only had one type, and the circulation time would not last longer than two or three months, unlike now, when almost "all stamps are revised in price, and without revision, there is no increase." To be clear, now the price-revised stamps are all small stamps revised to large ones, and the multiples are shockingly large. The variety is astonishing.</p>
<p>We often talk about inflation, but we are not sure to what extent it has inflated. But every time I see that the yellow one-cent martyr image stamp has been revised to one hundred yuan, I calculate it as 10,000 times, which stuns me. And there is more, the three-cent stamp is revised to five hundred yuan. Perhaps there are even greater multipliers. This kind of "price revision" can be used as an illustration in modern financial history.</p>
<p>In the more than 20,000 stamps I have collected, in terms of country, the most are of course from China, followed by Germany. The large number of German stamps is also due to the unspeakable number of "price-revised stamps" after the First World War. Later, the Germans couldn't keep up with the revisions, so they only printed blank stamps, with only the design printed on the stamp and an empty frame in the center, with a blank line below. The number of "marks" was temporarily printed with a lead character number in the central frame, and below that was an array of "〇" characters like soldiers in formation?</p>
<p>The face value of one of the German stamps I collected reached tens of billions of marks!</p>
<p>At that time, my older brother often brought back many used old envelope covers from a German foreign firm. I remember very clearly that although the postage for each letter sent to China was constantly and sharply increasing, eight or nine out of ten stamps on each envelope were only one stamp—a "price-revised stamp" or a stamp with a temporarily added number—and rarely more than two.</p>
<p>(More than ten years later, hearing that the Nazis' propaganda and securities for the invasion of Czechoslovakia were all printed and prepared one or two years before the incident, I therefore did not find it strange.)</p>
<p>Looking back at our China, the post office repeatedly asks senders not to affix countless small-denomination stamps to make up the postage for a mailing, but recently, in order to buy stamps for an overweight airmail letter requiring 750 yuan, the postal worker handed me as many as seventeen through the window? And all of them were "price-revised stamps"! I patiently affixed all seventeen stamps, one by one, while thinking about the fact that the country had to pay thirty-four times the printing costs, and the postal worker had to make sixteen extra stamping motions! I felt very sad.</p>
<p>The story is not over. This overweight letter of mine was already the required forty centimeters in size (because I wanted to save on postage, so I always weighed it on a balance before sending it). I don't know if I used too much glue, but heavens, after the seventeen stamps were glued on, the weight had already exceeded forty centimeters, and I had to add another 250 yuan in postage. But it was not easy to stick these seven stamps on the bottom of my envelope.</p>
<p>The letter had to be sent, so I had no choice but to write on the bottom of the envelope: "Please forgive the postal worker, because the postal window didn't have hundred-yuan stamps, so I had to combine two to make the amount."</p>
<p>I also wrote a line on the envelope, asking the recipient to return this envelope to me. At first, I only wanted to use it as one of my stamp collections, but after thinking more deeply, it seemed that I could also prepare it for someone to use as an illustration when writing about "old master politics" or "bureaucracy."</p>
<p>From now on, I vow never to collect any "price-revised stamps" again. From now on, I will regard them as a shameful mark of delay, waste, and incompetence.</p>
<h3>Rhapsody</h3>
<p>— Pingzhang</p>
<p>There is "Wang Baochuan," who is a "beauty that could topple kingdoms" and a "gone with the wind" in a time of chaos, bearing the "secret mission" of "counterattacking Burma" and "directly attacking Tokyo."</p>
<p>One day, "Wang Baochuan" carried "secret weapons" to investigate the "secrets of the Nazis." Unfortunately, she was trapped by "Japanese spies" of the "Black Dragon Society." Fortunately, she was saved by the "number one sharpshooter" and was able to "escape."</p>
<p>"Wang Baochuan" looked like a "lotus emerging from water." Although she had a "heart of iron," she could not help but fall into the "abyss" of "love." "Wang Baochuan" also had thoughts of "flying wing to wing," but "a fallen flower has an owner." She had already dedicated herself to "serving the country," so she did not want to "seek trouble." However, the "sharpshooter" was a "stubborn and affectionate man." He invited his "lover" to "Girl City" in a letter during "Christmas" to spend this "carnival" together and prepared "diamonds" and "jewel flowers" as gifts. But "Wang Baochuan" replied:</p>
<p>"Sharpshooter":</p>
<p>You are a "good young man," please don't have "romantic troubles"!</p>
<p>Our motherland is at a "critical moment," and now is the "time for young people to aspire"! Please join the "Intelligence Suicide Squad" or the "Guerrilla Suicide Squad" to bring glory to "unyielding China," ignite the "spark of national revival," and "walk with me," then "we will meet again one day! I wish you</p>
<p>"A bright future"!</p>
<p>The "sharpshooter" indeed became a "passionate man," "brave and unmatched in the three armies," "recaptured Midway Island," and opened a "bloody path" for "advancing China"!</p>
<h3>Morning Tea</h3>
<p>— Fangwen</p>
<p>Getting up early in the morning, a cup of morning tea can clear the mind and prolong life.</p>
<p>Chinese morning tea, scallion pancakes, soy milk, fried dough sticks, and porridge are the most common. Foreign morning tea, milk, toast, eggs, and oatmeal are similar. Although Chinese and foreign customs are different, the ingredients should be light and simple.</p>
<p>There is an ancient secret to preserving health: "Breakfast should be early, lunch should be full, and dinner should be light." It can be seen that morning tea should be early, in addition to being light and simple.</p>
<p>Wealthy families in Shanghai like to eat ginseng soup, white fungus, bird's nest, and chicken juice every morning instead of morning tea. It is said that tonic in the morning is especially effective.</p>
<p>Farmers in the countryside have long had the custom of eating morning tea. In small teahouses in towns and villages, thatched houses, paper windows, wooden tables, and long benches, all the talented people gather early in the morning. As the saying goes: "The seats are always full of guests, and the teapot is never empty." A pot of clear tea, a few puffs of yellow smoke, high-spirited discussions, north and south, without restraint.</p>
<p>Guangdong people are as particular about supper as they are about morning tea. Suzhou people are also very authentic about morning tea, making it a daily must-do. Nanjing people have long had a reputation for eating morning tea. Although Shanghai people have the habit of eating morning tea, they are too late, and it always feels like they have lost the meaning of the word "early."</p>

<h3>The Organization of Beggars 24</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiamo</p>
<p>The Secrets of Snakes and Beggars</p>
<p>Snake beggars often catch venomous snakes for people's homes in return for payment. Whenever a wealthy family has a snake problem in their yard, they hire them to catch it, and they never fail. Snake beggars are also happy to do this and do not ask for exorbitant prices. This is not because snake beggars value righteousness over wealth, but because the snakes they catch are sometimes extremely valuable, and the people always give them away unconditionally. In each area of the inland, there are always fixed snake beggars patrolling through each town and village every month.</p>
<p>Everything that has advantages also has disadvantages. Some snake beggars are cunning by nature. Sometimes, because business is slow, they secretly put trained snakes into the yards of wealthy families. Even if they are not poisonous, they can harm children and livestock, often causing chaos. So the wealthy family has no choice but to ask them to catch them, thereby obtaining a large profit. Sometimes, if the wealthy family does not ask, the snake beggar takes the initiative to knock on the door, claiming that there are venomous snakes in their residence and that if the people do not believe him, he can identify the smell of snakes and never fail. He is willing to catch them first and then be paid, to eliminate endless harm. The people naturally agree out of fear of disaster. So the snake beggar shows off his skills, first playing a short flute, the melody melancholic and moving. The snake hears the sound of the beggar's flute, uses the food to lure it, and the snake automatically comes out to be bound. After receiving the payment, the snake beggar leaves with the snake in his bag and can release it again in another home. The time between catching and releasing is probably no more than ten days. If it is too long, the snake will find a new hole or go elsewhere. People in the gang call it "losing the earth dragon's nest." Then they have to admit their bad luck, as the saying goes, "Trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice."</p>
<p>Snake beggars also automatically catch snakes to kill and sell the snake gall and snake skin to passersby. This is also a regular business, called "copying goods."</p>
<p>Kind men and devout women have the habit of releasing animals. Snake beggars take advantage of the mentality of Buddhist disciples to sell the caught small and medium-sized snakes to people for release. On the banks of West Lake, during Buddhist festivals, when crowds of people are worshipping and offering incense, it is their golden day. The business of selling snakes is very prosperous. These are all non-venomous water snakes. They are released today and caught by the snake beggar tomorrow to be sold again. The monks who manage the release pond of the Buddhist temple inevitably collude with the snake beggars, allowing them to catch the snakes again to sell. In the end, they are just deceiving the money of kind men and devout women.</p>
<p>Snake feces are the most valuable thing on a snake's body. But because snake feces are hard to come by, they are valuable because they are rare. When snake beggars obtain snake feces, it is said to be turning into gold. Originally, snake feces are "serpentine yellow." In addition to being a valuable medicine in the Chinese pharmacopoeia, it is also the best natural yellow color in pigments, and its value is very high. Every time they "turn into gold," it is a wealthy day for snake beggars to look down on their peers.</p>
<p>The most powerful gang of snake beggars is called the "Panhua Pole." The gang's ancestral snake medicine travels throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. They have rich experience in capturing large snakes. Their active areas are all the temperate regions of central China. Their footprints do not cross the Guandong region north of the Great Wall. The gang calls this "not going to the village." The "village" refers to Shanhaiguan and Hangu Pass. This is because the climate outside the pass is cold, and snakes are not easy to survive. New beggars entering the gang have very strict rules. They must first apprentice to a teacher and worship their ancestors, and first follow the teacher for three years doing the work of an assistant "holding the pole," which means catching and raising snakes. Only after they have mastered the art can they go out on the streets to beg, starting to appear to the world as snake beggars.</p>
<h3>Reflections on Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Kang Shi</p>
<p>The New Year's Day of the thirty-sixth year (1947) suddenly saw the heavens smiling, radiating "brightness"—truly an auspicious omen. Taking advantage of the holiday, I returned to Min (Fujian) for a family visit. Among my observations, I formed two main impressions.</p>
<p>The first is the deep suffering of the farmers. Rice prices are so low that they hurt the farmers, and cotton is even cheaper than rice. Consequently, the purchasing power in the rural areas around the towns is drastically lower than in previous years. Originally, Minhang relied heavily on the rice and cotton industry due to its strategic location as a hub for both water and land transport. Now, affected by the economic downturn, although no "bankruptcies" have occurred, it is said that several businesses are struggling to survive. Observing the decline and desolation of commerce throughout the town, I cannot help but lament the contrast between past and present. As the thirty-sixth year begins, the situation of "one farmer's failure bringing down a hundred merchants" is truly worrying!</p>
<p>The second impression is that the Resources Committee is said to have requisitioned 500 acres of farmland in Pubin, west of the town, to build a machinery factory. This has been brewing for half a year, and is now being implemented. The "private farmland," "private houses," and "graves" within the requisitioned area are being purchased or relocated with compensation. Most of the farmland has already been acquired with payment, posing no significant issue. However, the "private houses" and "graves" have caused unrest among the local people. It is said that the "relocation fees" are too low, and the people are already impoverished. Although the establishment of a machinery factory would contribute to national construction and boost the local economy, how can these many "private houses" find new homes with such minimal compensation? Moreover, the relocation fee for "graves" is only tens of thousands of yuan. Chinese customs place great importance on the remains of ancestors. For the sake of national construction, we may not dwell on superstitious Feng Shui beliefs, but are tens of thousands of yuan sufficient to cover labor costs and public cemetery fees for relocation? Therefore, the affected residents are voicing strong opposition. The authorities have reportedly changed their approach, allowing residents of the requisitioned "private houses" to work in the factory, and planning to designate a public cemetery for the relocation of graves. However, whether this can be realized depends on whether the authorities can truly "understand the people's hardships." We believe that "the way of governance lies in benevolence," and that we should not gain in one area while losing in another!</p>

<h3>On Chinese Characters</h3>
<p>— De Cai</p>
<p>The issue of polysyllabic words has been repeatedly discussed in "Free Talk." However, in my humble opinion, before discussing this issue, it seems valuable to first research and discuss the essential meaning and connotation of Chinese characters.</p>
<p>According to my presumptuous view: The Chinese language is the most excellent language in the world; Chinese characters are the most excellent script in the world.</p>
<p>Simplicity</p>
<p>Language is the use of sounds to represent a meaning or thing. Writing is the use of symbols to represent a meaning or thing. The most important requirements are simplicity, clarity, and lucidity. Our language completely uses monosyllables to represent single characters, and single characters to represent a single meaning or thing, making it as simple as it can possibly be. For example, 桌 (zhuō, table) is a single syllable, while in English it is "Table" and in Japanese it is "芝柯哀 (kikazari)" (stool), both consisting of three syllables. The speed comparison is three to one. Therefore, when delivering a speech expressing the same meaning, speaking in Chinese can save at least half the time compared to any other country in the world. This advantage is beyond the reach of any other country.</p>
<p>The same applies to writing: The writing systems of all countries in the world are linear, capable of indefinite extension backwards. Only our writing is planar, with very strict restrictions. It designates a small square space as a character, representing a meaning or thing, and that character is limited to a single syllable. Therefore, if a Chinese text is translated into the writing of any other country in the world, it will be longer than the Chinese text, and will never be shorter. Using the same method to record the same meaning, Chinese should be the first choice in saving time and materials in terms of writing.</p>
<p>Simplification</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, creating polysyllabic characters not only seems to be blindly imitating Europeanization, but actually seems to be a step backwards. "　", creating new characters is one thing, this word can sound like "馆" (guǎn, building), and the meaning is library. Applying it in writing can indeed save time. If it can be universally recognized, we might as well create several similar characters: 圈，　，　，　，　，　，　， These numbers all sound "馆" (guǎn, building), but have different meanings: (1) Photo studio, (2) Restaurant, (3) Teahouse, (4) Movie theater, (5) Opera hall, (6) Funeral home, (7) Gymnasium. In this way, □ obviously succeeds in becoming another new radical in the dictionary, but the meaning is a group.</p>
<p>As for the commonly used compound words in our country, such as: "鳳凰 (fèng huáng, phoenix)", "鴛鴦 (yuān yāng, mandarin duck)", "梧桐 (wú tóng, Chinese parasol tree)", "枇杷 (pí pá, loquat)", which are different analyses of male and female of the same category, is also a precise feature of Chinese characters, and now forcibly merging them into 　,　, seems to be superfluous and confusing.</p>
<p>However, inspired by the previous section, we feel that the simpler the characters, the better, and the fewer the strokes, the better. Simplifying the current complex Chinese characters as much as possible is definitely worth promoting. For example: "价 (jià)" to replace "價 (jià, price)"; "　" to replace "門 (mén, door)"; "　" for "時 (shí, time)"; "鉀 (jiǎ)" for "鐘 (zhōng, clock)"; "步 (bù)" for "歲 (suì, year)"; "斷 (duàn)" for "斷 (duàn, cut)"; "点 (diǎn)" for "點 (diǎn, point)"; "鉄 (tiě)" for "鐵 (tiě, iron)"; "獻 (xiàn)" for "獻 (xiàn, dedicate)"; "　" for "戲 (xì, play)"; "双 (shuāng)" for "雙 (shuāng, double)". The above is just a brief list of examples, but there must be many more characters that can be simplified. Such a change will definitely have great benefits for saving time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the function words in our language are also considered mysterious and rigid. In fact, function words are the punctuation marks in vernacular language: "也 (yě)" — . "乎 (hū)" — ? "耶 (yē)" — ? "焉 (yān)" — ; "歟 (yú)" — ?! "哉 (zāi)" — !? "之 (zhī)" — , "者 (zhě)" — ; "耳 (ěr)" —…</p>
<p>Therefore, the function words in classical Chinese are actually our old-fashioned punctuation marks. Compared to the new style, they are not as simple and should be eliminated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a difference between classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese. Classical Chinese is a shorthand form of vernacular Chinese. Although it is not colloquial, it is indeed inappropriate to use it as introductory teaching material for popularizing general education, but it has its own undeniable place and value for shorthand. The decline of classical Chinese is due to (1) the decline in general cultural standards, and (2) the immature shorthand skills of those who write classical Chinese, as well as their punctuation - namely function words. After the promotion of Chinese culture, if we want to save time and simplify articles, we will still get closer to classical Chinese.</p>
<p>Excellence</p>
<p>Chinese characters are actually too excellent. Not only do some people not cherish them, but they despise them and think they are outdated. Chinese characters do have their inherent value. I hope that "Free Talk" can submit this to the Weekly Miscellany as a special topic, so that everyone can express more opinions to discuss and research, in order to determine whether Chinese characters are excellent or not!</p>
