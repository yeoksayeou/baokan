<h3>總裁主持全會開幕　朂勉完成革命任務　肅淸武裝叛亂還政於民</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電」由國國民黨第六屆中央執行委員會第四次全體會議及中央黨團聯席會議，九日晨假國大會堂隆重舉行揭幕禮，總理首次起義紀念合併舉行，到中委及靑年團中央幹，監事曁各省市黨團列席人員約五百人，蔣總裁親臨主持。大會九時廿分開始，蔣總裁於悠揚樂聲中步登主席位，領導全體行禮如儀後，即席致開會詞，歷四十分鐘完畢，全體報以熱烈之掌聲，旋即禮成。十時半接開預備會，仍由蔣總裁主特，通過議事日程（與本報昨載相同〕及主席團人選，十一時散會。主席團于右任，居正，孫科，戴傳賢，陳果夫，鄒魯，丁惟汾，賀衷寒，劉健羣，陳雪屛，袁守謙十一人，繼之舉行會議，決定第一次大會執行主席人選。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕國民黨四中全會九日下午三時假國民大會堂舉行第一次大會，由蔣總裁親自主特，秘書處報吿出席執·監委·候補執·監委，靑年團中央幹事。監察，候補幹事·監察及列席人員共四六四人後，即由吳秘書長鐵城作黨團統一組織報吿，張院畏羣作政治報吿，報吿畢，休息廿分鐘，繼續開會，由于院長主席，白部長報告軍事，六時卅五分散會。</p>
<p>蔣總裁開會詞</p>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕四中全會及黨團聯席會議九日開幕，蔣總裁親臨主持，即席致詞略謂：今日是本黨四中全會開幕的一天，亦即乙未年（一八九五年）總理廣州起義的紀念日，回想過去五十年來，本黨無數先烈同志，在總理領導之下，拋頭顱，洒熱血，艱苦奮鬥，爲本黨革命事業樹立深固之基礎，今日臨此偉大紀念，凡我黨員，團員全體同志，人人均應自省自反，奮發努力，以期發揚本黨光榮之歷史，完成總理與先烈未竟之志事，然後始能安慰總理與先烈在天之英靈。總裁繼謂：本黨革命事業，自抗戰勝利以後，已進入一新的階段，在此階段中，革命環境更加困難，而任務更爲艱鉅，本黨同志，唯有充實本黨，加强組織，共同一致，努力奮勉，以期排除萬難，完成三民主義新中國之建設。目前最迫切之工作，尤在肅淸武裝叛國之共匪，完成國家之統一與召開國民大會，實行憲政，以示本黨還政於民之決心。本黨爲達成此一任務，實非一意志，集中力量不可，故黨團統，一組織，乃爲改進本黨自身之唯一急務，希望各同志認淸其意義與本身之責任，誠心誠意，澈底實行，黨團統一組織之後，先進同志必員本親愛精誠之精神，扶持後進，而後起同志尤須寳愛本黨光榮之歷史，認識革命偉大之使命，服從黨的命令，遵守黨的紀律，團結一致，和衷共濟，乃能加强本黨革命的力量，實現三民主義，完成本會議之迫切任務。</p>
<h3>張院長在全會　報告政治外交</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕四中全會九日下午第一次大會中，行政院張院長羣報吿政治及外交，歷一小時又十分。張氏首說明政府改組後之行政院的立塲稱：在現階段中，國府委員會已代替國防最高委會，成爲國家最高決策機關，行政院依國府委會之決策，負執行之責。張氏於此對參加政府之谷黨推誠相與，共體時艱，頗致讚佩。繼報吿關於國內局勢，指出政府維護和平統一的苦心、並强調總動員之意義，在以「戡亂求統一，以苦幹謀復興」，集中全國的意志與力量，不止不消極的戡亂，尤其要積極的建設。</p>
<p>財政經濟</p>
<p>次陳述財政。經濟情形時，張氏指出，本年來國家預算情形，因軍事緊張，經濟凋瘁，支出浩繁，政府雖盡力撙節，然必要之支出仍不能强爲緊縮，政府對策係一方撙節支出，一方盡量增加收入，其方法主要爲整頓稅收，其次使以發行公債彌補，雖難望預算完全平衡，祗能從减少差額方向努力，至幣制改革，則尙未到條件成熟階段。</p>
<p>次及國際收支情形，戰後兩年國際收支，皆爲逆超，自經濟緊急措施方案實行後，初期尙能維持平衡，嗣又轉入逆超。八月改定進出口貿易及外匯管理辦法後，三星期來，收支尙有餘裕，本期進口除特許進口物資仍由中央銀行結匯外，其餘由指定銀行按市價結匯，數額無多，以出口物資及華僑匯回之外匯抵補，預計仍有餘裕。張氏指出，當前財政經濟之困難，祗有運用雄厚的人力，開發廣大的土地與資源，求自力更生之道。經濟緊急措施方案，因情勢變遷有所修正，仍當繼續切實執行，但此爲治標的，至治本方面之經濟改革方案，有積極實施之必要，正由全國經濟委會擬訂實施辦法，陸續辦理中</p>
<p>於此，張氏舉出今日中國的財政經濟政策的三個原則：（一）爲求預算收支之平衡，必須節省支出，增加收入。（二）爲求國際收支的平衡，必須節制進口，獎勵出口。（三）爲求物資供需的平衡，必須節約消費，增加生產。張氏並强調中國祗有以刻苦自勵，節省支出，屛絕享受，盡力增加生產，始爲自力更生之途。中國工業基礎薄弱，但農礦業方面可開發者尙多，國人應該盡其努力。政府最近所頒布的厲行節約辦法綱要，改訂管理進出口和外匯辦法及四聯總處理事會議所通過之緊縮放款原則，皆本於此種需要而決定。</p>
<p>政治改革</p>
<p>次及政治改革問題，張氏認爲：政府中若干不肖分子，腐化凟職，違法貪汚情形，形成風氣，而此種不良的政治風氣，其原因爲多元的，乃是一個嚴重的社會問題，本政府的立塲，常審愼人事銓選，加强弊端的防範，嚴行監査，獎勵檢舉，一經發現貪汚一，立即澈査嚴辦，並課其主管上一級人負以聯帶責任，以期澈底革新政治風氣。至於待遇問題，亦爲影響政治風氣之一原因，此次一調整待遇，僅先求文武職及國營一事業機關人員待遇之平，至如何達到合理標凖，尙有待於籌劃。</p>
<p>關於行政效率問題，張氏認爲欲提高行政效率，必須權責分朋，組織設備完善，辦事程序簡單合理，無駢支之機關，無矛盾之法令，數年來中央曾不斷研究討論改善，改組後之行政院，更特別置重於此一問題。張氏謂：上述幾個條件，中央機關已相差甚遠，而省縣級情形尤不合理。關於省級方面的法令調整問題，行政院已決定組織一行政法規整理委會負責，機構方面，上月曾乘各省主席來京參加糧食會議之便，召集四次行政座談會，聽取意見，同時，邀照主席指示，就省級各問題通盤硏討，擬制定一省政改革與簡化之方案，但尙未達到決定階段。至縣級問題，政院已通令各省，由省政府負責執行，除財政方案已呈國務會議，須俟完成法案，再予實施外，餘如機構之管理，緊縮縣長兼職的减少，指揮系統的限制，以及縣級員吏選拔，考核各點，都予確切指示。</p>
<p>外交方面</p>
<p>關於外交方面，張氏强調戰後我國外交基本要求是爭取世界和平，使中國獲得安定與建設的機會，政府一面要盡力維持自身和各主要盟邦的友好關係，另一面要擁護聯合國來促進主要列强的合作。</p>
<p>對美外交，美國在戰時與我並肩作戰，戰後遺俘受降，給我帮助也甚多，今後在國際政治上與我互相合作的機會也甚多。張氏說到美國對華情形，有些看法相當正確，可爲我自反自勵之藥石，但對於中國所遭遇之困難，亦不能完全了解，故此後對美必須增强兩國間之相互了解，以加强其合作關係。</p>
<p>至於對蘇外交，中蘇接鄰相處，關係必須友好，鑒於此種事實需要，我戰後便與蘇聯訂立了中蘇友好條約，這個條約，中國是很吃虧的，但當時政府爲欲與蘇聯有一共同的信約，以爲調整兩國邦交的基礎，故不情接受了雅爾達的密約，放鬆了東北一部份主權，現在中國對蘇祗是要求中蘇友好條約的實現，中國絕對遵守條約義務，如果蘇聯有不遵守，我們必定據理力爭。</p>
<p>關於否決權問題，中國主張不應根本修改憲章，取消否決權，但認爲應設法成立一合理之解釋，限制其濫用。</p>
<p>談到對日和約問題，張氏指出，我們基本態度是不採季復主義，但決不放棄我們對日要求應得的賠償。我們願見日本和平復興，但必須防制他重爲遠東和平的威脅。</p>
<p>韓國問題，張氏極表關切，並說明中國所期待的是一個統一獨立的新韓國的產生，凡有助於這種目的的，中國都願予以促成，凡違反這種目的的，中國必加反對。</p>
<p>最後，張氏提到弱小民族自由獨立問題，民族的獨立自由，本是國民黨的基本政策，此次東南亞民族爭取獨立自由，中國在原則上，自表同情，但對於僑民生命財產的維護，尤其重要。（完）</p>
<h3>今日議程</h3>
<p>日今日上下午均舉行黨團聯席會議，討論黨的新建議綱領，晚間召開整理委員會。</p>
<h3>四中全會開幕禮拾零</h3>
<p>國民大會堂，今天從新充滿了無限喜悅與莊嚴的空氣。國民黨的四中全會和黨團聯席會議，今天在這兒揭幕了。八百左右的黨團幹部，從各個地區携來了他們的意見來參與這一次黨內外劃時代的重要會議。</p>
<p>陰曇了幾天的首都，今天一碧萬頃，秋空高朗，淸晨的陽光，輝煌的照射到會堂前飄拂的黨國旗織，牠給予人們興奮之情，也給人們以致敬的崇高之意。</p>
<p>▽會塲的布置和過去略有不同，牠了，也顯示了黨與團的團結和合作，四壁和過道裏，隨處可以見到的是黨國旗的交輝，是團徽和黨徽的配合，而淡黃色的牆壁，配上紅藍的色調，是一種調和，在極度柔和的氣氛裏，每一個人都有了很平靜恬適的情緒，有人以此祝大會圓滿的結果。</p>
<p>會塲裏一片闊別重逢的問好聲，一片競選凖備的詢問聲，每個人都表現了無限的關懷。</p>
<p>揭幕禮開始，在歡迎的樂聲中，黨的領導蔣總裁自後面緩步走出來，今天是穿的草黃色中山服，那白銀色的髮根曾經使每一個忠黨愛國的黨同志發出一點點憂思，也發出無限體念元首辛勞的思念，但是，煥發的容光，那烱烱有光而堅定的雙睛，人們把這些想法都掃除了。</p>
<p>總裁訓示的聲浪，還是那麼淸晰，幾乎還是那麼年靑而有勁，他說是團結就是力量，統一發生新的生命的語句，多够人警當前艱困環境中所需要的團結與統一</p>
<p>總裁的訓示完畢後，一陣響亮的鼓掌在會塲裏發出，是一種興奮和一種崇敬，總裁慈祥的帶着答謝的意思退出。</p>
<p>▽中委宋美齡，今天不曾以蔣夫人的身份在台上或是前排出現，她只是坐在中委的後排中間座位上，來時她是比總裁先出現於會塲的，一身黑底白花的長袍，加上黑色的短外衣，表現著靜靜不突出的身份</p>
<p>開幕式禮成後，休息了廿分鐘，接著舉行預備會，還是由蔣總裁主持，當推選主席團開始時，馬超俊立即提出請總裁指定人選的意見，當獲全體一致贊同，這種可貴的信任，在這裏充分表現了。</p>
<p>蔣夫人並排坐的是錢用和張維楨兩位女參政員，看起來非常親蜜，夫人始終表現出很和靄的笑容，下午沒有出席，大家說「大槪因爲她對政府大計早就熟悉萬分了」。</p>
<p>大會休息室還是在樓上，和國民大會不同的是有茶無點，雖然備有汽水和可口可樂，但得自費辦理。</p>
<p>大會的時間處理，已經做到遵守節約消費的條件，上午的不必說，下午大會原定自下午三時至七時畢，結果三時五分始至六時卅五分即畢。</p>
<p>政治·軍事的報吿，都能扼要簡單，所以一個下午，三個報吿，沒有使人發生疲勞轟炸的感覺。每一位報吿的時間都差不多一小時。</p>
<p>▽白崇禧報吿軍事，在政令部份已有書面文件，但白氏報吿時還是按卷閱讀，有錯的並加訂正，台下也就大做其校對工作</p>
<p>會塲裏沒有新聞記者的足跡，謝絕旁聽，不過在塲內散發的報紙却不少。</p>
<h3>吳鐵城在全會報告　黨團統一組織</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕吳委員鐵城，九日下午在四中全會第一次會議中，作黨團統一組織報告，大要如下：</p>
<p>本人以黨團統一組織委員會召集人之一的資格，奉令報吿黨團統一組織一件大事進行之經過，並略述領袖指示之要義，與同志之意見，甚感榮幸。前在民國廿七年三月召開本黨臨全大會於武漢時，爲加強領導軍民從事抗戰之力量，除建立總理逝世後黨的領袖粉外，同時組織三民主義靑年團，賴比建制，在戰時發揮極大力量，終於獲得最後勝利。現在共產黨危害國家民族、分化革命力量之伎倆，比以前更爲險毒，黨團同志均覺悟到當前第一件大事爲提高一心一德之精神，加强　策羣力之行動，以答復中共之分化，消滅中共之叛亂。在本年三月間，本黨開三中全會時，黨團幹部已提出黨團統一領導之建議，後經黨團中央負責同志多次會議，詳加硏究及經總裁兼團長之指示，遂有黨團統一組織委員會用黨團統一組織指導委員會之設置。由此擬出本黨新建設網領草案，草案中一部份爲本黨目前組織綱領草案，一部份爲本黨目前政治綱領草案。此案除製成議題發交各省市黨團部同志研究外，最近中央團部二中全會亦經詳加研討，其意見將送黨團聯度</p>
<h3>靑年團二中全會　討論黨的改造綱領草案　原則通過另作文字修正</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京九日電〕靑年團二中全會於八日上午九時繼續舉行第四次大會，陳雪屛主席，討論「黨的改造綱領草案」。該項草案自經十八人小組綜合硏究補充後，已較前爲充實完備。當前政治綱領部份，經整理增改爲八項，其內容綱要：（一）確保國家統一與領土完整。（二）實現政治民主，如期完成憲政。（三）澈底刷新政治，嚴厲懲治貪汚。（四）保障農工大衆之經濟利益，合理改善官兵及公敎人員之待遇。（五）保障靑年升學就業機會均等。（六）發揮自力更生精神，激勵全國人民建國熱情。（七）擁護集體安全，尊重國際平等，維護世界和平等。當前組織綱領部份，增改爲：（一）原則，（二）黨員，（三）各級組織，（四）幹部，（五）紀律等五項，當由主席逐條宣讀，詳細硏府，尤以各級組織部份討論最久，結果原則通過，另推黃少谷。陳介生·李俊龍·涂公遂·陳雪屛等組織五人小組，參考各項修正意見，作文字上之修正，十二時十分散會。</p>
<h3>靑年黨中執委會　曾琦當選主席　左舜生等當選中常委</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中國靑年黨第十一屆中執委會曁中檢委會，九日卞午三時假麗都花國，分別舉行第一次大會，選舉主席曁常委，票選結果，曾琦當選中執委會主席。左舜生，李璜，陳啓天，余家菊，于復先，何魯之，鄭振文，劉東岩，夏濤聲，王師曾，林可璣，楊永浚，喩孝權（女），張子柱，劉靜遠，王嵐曾，段愼修，劉四英等十八人爲中執會常務委員。李不韙，張夢九當選中檢會正副主席。</p>
<p>會議參考，一俟四中全會通過後，即爲全體同志今後運動之最高凖繩。此次會議，爲富有革命性，建設性，政治性之會議，爲集中革命力量，鞏固革命組織之會議。其由此會談而實現以黨團統一組織之力量，其必可以戡定變亂，統一國家，改善民生國計，將同於民國前二年改組興中會爲同盟會以後卒能推翻淸廷，民國三年改組國民黨爲中華革命黨以後之卒能推翻袁世凱帝制，民國十三年改組中國國民黨以後之卒能蕩平軍閥，民國二十七年本黨實行新建設以後之卒能獲得抗戰勝利，故黨團同志，對此次革命組織之統一，革命力量之團結，均具有信篤決心。</p>
<h3>魏使將建議　大量援華</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山九日廣播，紐約下午報載稱，魏特邁特使在華調查報告雖仍秘而不宣，但自各方觀察，魏氏將建議給予國民政府以鉅額之援助。據華盛頓消息靈通方面稱，魏氏於八月二十四日發表之聲明，並未關閉進一步援助中國之門。</p>
<h3>王外長抵舊金山　華府傳我曾通知美政府　決心自力更生剿共建國</h3>
<p>〔中央社舊金山八日電〕我出席聯合國第二次大會首席代表王世杰及其隨行人員一行，業於今晚抵達此間。王氏於啓程赴世界首都紐約之先，擬在舊金山逗留二日。</p>
<p>〔聯合社舊金山八日電〕中國外長王世杰談：「中共軍隊倘不摧毀，中國無和平之望。」但王氏對於此事如何或何時可以完成，則不表示意見。或問國內恢複和談仍有希望否？王氏鄭重答曰：「否」。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>接受批評　力謀改時</h3>
<p>——讀　蔣主席演辭之後</p>
<p>中國國民黨第六屆四中全會，昨晨在首都隆重開幕，曾由蔣主席親臨主持，並卽席致辭，指出抗戰勝利已屆二年，革命已至最後關頭，成敗利鈍，在此一舉：革命大業之危險困難，較之過去任何時期爲尤茶，故此次全會的主要任務，乃在謀黨團之合併與統一。今後吾人應注意者有下列兩端：（一）最近我國政治經濟以及軍事，均曾受到外人的批評，吾人不應因此而生反感，而應虛心接受善意的批評，力謀政治經濟以及軍事之改進；（二）今後我們若欲消滅共匪，安定中國，則必須革新黨的內部，同時在政治經濟以及軍事各方面，均應力謀改進。蔣主席的演辭，雖非針對杜魯門總統特使魏德邁將軍所發表的離華聲明而發，但是　蔣主席虛懷若谷的胸襟，不僅共本人能虛心接受別人的批評，而且還要以此勉勵國民黨全體黨員，真不愧爲當代第一流的政治家。我舞將　英文名主席的演詞，反覆育讀，深信不論是國民黨的黨員或不是國民黨的黨員，凡是中華民國的一份子，都應該接受蔣主席的指示與敎誨</p>
<p>昨日本報社論希望國民黨能够領導國人，走上『自力更生』的途徑，以完成戡　建國的任務，並非看了魏德邁特使的聲明，有感而發，而是我們內審國內大局外顧世界形勢的結果，相信中國只有一條出路，這就是『自力更生』。所謂『天助自助』，只要我們眞能走上『自力更生』　途徑，就不愁沒有國際　協助。理由非常簡單，為我國人所週知，卽以此次搞戰勝利而論，在七七事變爆發之後，我舞如果不以自已的血肉與敵人的砲火相拼，孤軍奮鬥下去，決不會使國際形勢變成完全有利於我國的局面。我國抗戰獲勝的事實，實足以證明中國唯有走自力更生的一途，捨此而外，別無生路。這是我國朝野對於當前國是的共同一致的認識，不待魏德邁特使發表聲明，我們早就知道應該走這一條『自力更生』的大道。聞我國政府在魏氏發表離華聲明之前，早就有一個備忘錄，送達魏德邁特使，只是這個備忘錄，未經官方宣佈而已。據美國合衆社的報道，在這個未發表的備忘錄裏，中國政府鄭重聲明，中國單獨抗戰曾歷四年之久：故中國相信其有克服當前困難之能力。同時並指出『自力更生』的四個步驟：（一）共調擁用武力，必須加以敉半；任何折衷辦法，均不能加以考慮。……此一鬥爭之結果，實有關整個遠東之和平與安全。（二）立卽採取有效步驟，以管制通貨膨脹，不再延綏。（三）　政府資源所允許的範圍內，加緊進行經濟復興的工作，（四）實施政治改革，業已建立基本民主的制度與實際，今後並將繼續努力。合衆社的報道如果是千眞萬確的事實，則中國政府早就凖備實行自力更住，也可於此獲一明證了。</p>
<p>魏德邁特使的離華聲明，可以從兩個角度去觀察；國內輿論界也有兩種不同的看法：一是認魏氏的聲明爲友人的諍言，我們應該虛心接受其批評，六着『有則改之，無則加勉』的態度，尤應深切反省，力謀政治經濟以及軍事的改革；二是認魏氏的聲明不啻爲對中國人民的一大侮辱，人人應該引以爲奇恥大辱，所謂『知恥近乎勇』，在慚愧中替國家民族殺出一條血路來。政府的態度如何？因未發表正式女吿，我們無從探悉，但今天我們看了蔣主席的演詞，可以明瞭蔣主席的看法了。蔣主席的胸襟，虛懷若谷，有容納外人批評的大量，眞令人欽佩。其實所謂民主政治，就是一種經得起別人批評的政治，沒有反對派的批評與攻擊，政治就不會有進步，我們從英美民主政治的實際運用上，早就看出這一個微妙的作用。今後國民黨不僅應該虛心接受別人的批評，而且還應該隨時反省，所謂『一日三省吾身』，唯有如此，始能『自强不息』，始能『日新又新』。蔣主席既已承認此際已到了革命成敗的最後關頭，我們自然也不必諱言，國民黨內部的組織，實有立卽加以改造的必要。國民黨執政廿餘年來，共產黨一直是國民黨唯一的敵黨，但其勢力不僅沒有削弱，反而日見膨大，別種因素固然不一而足，但是國民黨內部的不健全，不能不認爲是重要因素之一。現在我們已在戡亂期間，除了用武力敉平而外，國民黨還得要自動革新，俾能配合軍事，如此雙管齊下，才能收事半功倍之效。</p>

<h3>應付當前重大經濟危機　英閣會商新決策　擬向國際貨幣基金會借欵勉渡難關　平衡輸出入為最大課題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦九日廣播：今日英內閣舉行會議，艾德禮首相已銷假，親自出席主持，討論復興美國經濟之方法，藉以應付當前之經濟危機。在今後一星期，英政府將不斷舉行政治經濟及財政性質之會議，情緒緊張。英國方面亟求消除輸入及輸出　商之差額，因此本星期四在倫敦舉行之國際貨幣基金會議，對英國之經濟局勢，具有重大影響，良以世界經濟，係息息相通者也。英國方面可能要求由國際貨幣基金會以若干數額之美元供給英國，以待馬鄭計劃之實施，此項過渡性質之辦法，足以協助英國克服當前之困難。在本星期中，最令人注意者，厥為商相克里浦斯將於週五宣布之提高生產增加出口藉使輸出入數額逐漸接近之方案。英國可能再度緊縮食物及其他商品之輸入。英國之經濟戰爭，殆將逐漸迫近高潮矣。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦八日電〕美國財政部長史奈特頃於本日行抵此間，將與貢國進行重要會談，但再以美元接濟英國一事，成功之機會恐尚有待。史奈特乘「伊麗莎白王后」號郵船抵南安普頓港時，英財相達爾頓特自倫敦乘汽車趕至碼頭迎接，同時亦迎接乘該輪抵英之加拿大財長阿波特。史氏乃以國際銀行與國際貨幣基金董事會美國董事資格抵英，參加第二次年會，但亦將乘此機會，與英相艾德禮，財相達爾頓及英國其他高級官員，討論英國之財政情形。就目前情形而論，英國在馬歇爾計劃付諸實行之前，或有三種辦法可以取得美元接濟，即：（一）解凍繼續洽商期間所凍結之最後一批美國借款，計四億美元；（二）向美國進出口銀行商借；（三）向國際貨幣基金或世界銀行商借。按隨史氏來英者，有出席國際貨幣基金會議之各國財政專家百餘人。</p>
<h3>英法盟約換文　有效期為五十年　具有防禦建設兩大目標</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕今年三月在鄧扣克簽字之英法同盟條約，業於八日在此正式批准，簡單之儀式在英外部內舉行。英外相具文及法大使馬西格利互相致辭，表示英法決站在同一陣綫，匪特以對付今後之任何軍事侵略，且將協力採取建設性之經濟行動，以維持西方文明。按該約有效期五十年，規定於德國從事再侵略時，實行英法互助，並規定兩國應就影響兩國經濟關係之事務，經常交換意見。貝文指出該約具有預防的及建設的兩個目標，其意不啻昭告德國，如　武主義或侵略企圖再度發生，英法決一致對付之。馬西格利之答辭謂，該約業已規定英法具有共同之志願及共同的目標，相信此約將為更密切合作時代之開端。</p>
<h3>貝文定期赴法</h3>
<p>會商歐洲經濟報告書</p>
<p>〔中央社倫敦八日電〕英外相貝文以會議主席資格，已邀請歐洲十二國外長出席研討馬歇爾計劃之巴黎經濟會議。據悉，貝文外相或將於十六日赴巴黎，出席末次全體會議，屆時各項報告當可提出付諸研討。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎九日電〕主持推行馬歇爾援歐復興計劃之經濟合作委員會今日開始審查糧食農業小組報告書。該項報告書說明歐洲十六國一致主張在今後四年內需要美國貸款二百十九億美元，作為購辦糧食或產糧工具之用。</p>
<h3>英將同意美要求　减低帝國優先權</h3>
<p>〔合衆社日內瓦八日電〕英國消息靈通人士告本社訪員稱：英國今將同意美國之要求，將各地貨物之帝國優先權，加以切實减低，并將除去若干優先條例。約二百種貨物之現行優先稅率將予以减低百分之五至百分之廿五，此項答復，英國將於本週內送達美國云。</p>
<h3>歐洲聯邦議會　舉行首次會議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社瑞士格斯達八日電〕「歐洲聯邦議會」今日舉行首次會議，主席奧國卡勒基教授致詞，略謂馬歇爾發起之巴黎十六國經濟合作會議，定必失敗，其阻礙與一九二九年法外長白里安召集歐洲外長會議討論組織歐洲聯邦相同，即人人在原則上贊同，但在實施上歧異，因人人準備享受聯邦之利益，却無人願出以必要之犧牲。歐洲聯邦絕不可能，除非各會員移交其一部份主權於聯邦政府。惟各國政府均不願如此犧牲。「歐洲聯邦議會」之三大政綱如下：（一）動員歐洲國會多數黨，贊助聯邦；（二）促進各該黨之合作；（三）召集歐洲制憲會議。</p>
<h3>英煤礦工潮擴大</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦八日電〕約克郡煤礦工人之非正式罷工，已於今日進入第五週，全部停工者廿六礦，部份停工者十八礦，怠工工人總計四萬三千名，損失之煤已逾四十萬噸。</p>
<h3>調解英埃爭端　幕後努力失敗</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖九日電〕今日據悉：聯合國安理會各代表對於調解英埃爭執之幕後努力已告失敗，未能打破僵局，現決休會廿四小時。此次調解努力係由中國代表團發動，但卒無法為致大多數理事國所能接受之折衷方案。</p>
<h3>英擬與蘇聯談判　謀打開原子能管制僵局</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖九日電〕據悉：英國將建議舉行英蘇兩國之會談，以謀打破東西兩方對原子能管制問題久縣未泆之僵局。英官方稱，「其他對此問題有興趣之國家」，亦歡迎參加。</p>
<p>英國深切瞭解對如何管制原子能問題未能協議之危機，在八日蘇聯堅決反對大多數國家所支持之美國管制原子能計劃之原則，並否決委員會所提出之實施該計劃之草案後，英國乃決定進行英蘇談判之計劃。八月間蘇代表葛羅米柯答覆英代表賈德幹之問題時，亦曾表示贊同各大國之管制而非國際之管制，此亦為促使英國提出目前計劃之理由之一。其他若干政府似亦頗多有同意英國之計劃者。蓋各該國深信繼續原子能委員會之辯論，必不能打破僵局，且深信如無蘇聯或其他任何大國之參加，則原子能之管制亦決不可能云。</p>
<h3>史達林出巡　視察黑海區域</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦九日電〕莫斯科電台九日廣播稱：史達林總理八月十九日乘六千八百噸之「莫洛托夫」號自克里米亞出發至高加索，跨越黑海，在一天內作三百哩之遊弋。史達林自雅爾達至沙基時，偕蘇維埃部長會議副主席同行，但史氏是否仍留沙基，或已返莫斯科，無從探悉，按沙基乃史氏之冬季避寒地。史達林此次赴黑海視察艦隊，足證蘇聯對於黑海艦隊之違造以及黑海區之重視。在黑海對岸即為土耳其領土所在。</p>
<h3>英空軍出動　嚴防猶太飛機空襲</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦八日電〕英航空部八日透露：該部已採取戰時措置，蓋該部接獲情報，十二晚猶太人有轟炸倫敦之企圖。皇家偵察除及雷達站已隨時戒備，夜間戰鬥機亦已昇空，高射機關槍及高射砲均上膛，十二日夜所有飛越南海岸之飛機須經夜間戰鬥機之檢查。航空部又稱：防衛飛機是否將向來歷不明之飛機襲擊，須視「環境」而定。</p>
<h3>英美成立協議　共管魯爾煤礦</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦八日電〕英國外交部消息靈通人士八日晚稱：英國已允許美國共同經營管理歐州復興寄託最大之魯爾煤礦。此決定可能在四十八小時內宣佈，作為英美協議增加魯爾煤產計劃之一部份。預計此聲明將在華盛頓及倫敦同時公佈，以結束在美京舉行幾已一月之談判。依此規定，現由英國管制之北德煤礦將移交與一新的英美經營局。美方則保證魯爾礦工將獲得較一般為高之口糧，並保證協助恢復魯爾區賴以輸入煤產之鐵路系統，聲明中對魯爾煤礦國有一項棘手問題將絕口不提，雖雙方不能討論此問題，然以其不在正式議程之內，故無決定可言也。英國相信煤礦應歸國有，美國則希望由公民複決投票解決之。</p>
<p>〔路透社柏林八日電〕英美法三國代表今日在此舉行關於魯爾煤及焦煤出口之談判，將涉及因英美決定提高德工業水準而引起之煤斤消費問題。</p>
<h3>四强會商朝鮮問題　美宣布展期舉行　國務院仍盼蘇聯提出解決辦法</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕國務院今日宣布，美國前建議於九月八日舉行四國會議，討論朝鮮問題，中英兩國雖已表示同意，但蘇聯拒絕參加，茲決定展期，但並未作罷，惟何時可以舉行，美國此後如何設法打開僵局，均尚難言。蘇聯覆文所謂美蘇混合委員會尚未至智窮力竭之境，揆其用意，蘇聯戟將提出其他解決辦法。該委員會美代表勃朗亦謂，蘇聯有何建議，自願隨時加以考慮。朝鮮右派領袖李承晚則在漢城宣稱：「君向蘇聯希望什麽？現惟有將朝鮮問題提交聯合國機構處理。」</p>
<h3>日首相呼籲　勞動界協力</h3>
<p>工人不滿最低工資標準</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京九日電〕日政府召集之全日本勞動委員會聯絡協議會，八日於東京舉行首次會議，政府方面出席者有片山，和田，米窪等大臣以及其他有關首長。勞動大臣米窪發表聲明：「標準工資一千八百圓，難於維持生活，本人對此殊為明瞭，故增加配給物資，而提高實質上之工資。倘於十一月中，尚不能維持生活，則政府亦將重新講求對策」。繼由片山首相要求勞動者予以協力後散會。</p>
<p>〔親亞社東京九日電〕日政府於勞動基準法實施後，決定建立最低工資制，以確保勞動者之生活，惟現行標準殊不符實際，故此次如何決定最低工資之基礎，實為勞動階級是否支持片山內閣之分歧點，頗堪注目。</p>
<h3>荷督范莫克　與馬卿長談</h3>
<p>美荷有獲致諒解可能</p>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓八日電〕美國國務卿馬歇爾及副國處卿洛維德今日與荷督范莫克及荷駐義大使克里芬斯　話一小時半，討論荷印局勢。　後范氏語記者稱，渠與馬歇爾談話後，更覺有希望對此問題獲得進一步之諒解。范氏續稱，除經由聯合國覓致解決外，現未開始使用其他方法以謀解決問題。荷大使稱：戰時荷蘭女皇主張荷蘭殖民地加强自治，此項政策迄無更改。</p>
<p>〔路透社康白拉八日電〕澳總理齊夫萊宣布，澳洲已接受印尼之請，担任調查印尼爭端之聯合國三人委員會中之一委員。齊氏並稱，該委會將代表安理會執行斡旋印荷爭端之建議。</p>

<h3>日公職審查委會　考慮整肅蘆田均</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京九日電〕最近因蘆田外相在京都發表政界動　之談話後，此間對於蘆田片山間之微秒關係，頗多推測。據本社探悉，關於蘆田是否依言論界之整肅條例而被整肅事，最近又有新發展。緣前次開脫蘆田之理由為英文「日本時報」之發行額在一萬份以下：，但現經中央公職資格審查委員會某委員調查，該英文「日本時報」戰前及戰時之發行額決不止一萬份，或者在二萬份以上。就目前在紙荒嚴重　用紙强力管制之下，該報仍有一萬二千份之發行額一點，亦可獲得反證。聞某委員就此且有以去就力爭之表示，雖已由某某兩大新聞當局出面調停，然恐終難私了。此事或與蘆田發表前項談話，不無關係也。</p>
<h3>裕仁故態復萌　拒與工人握手</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京九日電〕日皇裕仁雖欲與平民接觸，但仍拒絕與工人領袖握手。裕仁視察日光時，銅廠工會領袖安藤，代表工人，要求與裕仁行握手禮，裕仁婉辭拒絕謂，「請以日本禮節代之」。言時微笑，向安蘆回禮。此事引起軒然大波，有謂安藤無禮，亦有謂其出於至誠，傳工會方面將對其表示不信任，以示懲戒。</p>
<h3>東南亞聯盟　舉行成立大會</h3>
<p>〔合衆社曼谷九日電〕東南亞聯盟昨晚在此間拉泰納柯辛大旅館，舉行成立大會，出席者有暹羅·維明·印尼·馬來亞·柬埔寨等國代表，緬甸與菲列濱無代表參加。希星克漢被推為大會主席，維明領袖季勞為副主席。聯盟之目的在促進東南太平洋各國之瞭解，維護各國人民之獨立，促進世界和平，維護人權，並交換情報與成立海國聯邦。</p>
<h3>印度流血暴動擴大　甘地馳抵新德里　美使蒙督會商一般局勢</h3>
<p>〔路透社新德里九日電〕美駐印大使　蘭第今日曾至督署與蒙巴頓談一小時，葛氏事後不願透露談話內容，僅曰曾討論印度一般局勢。</p>
<p>〔路透社新德里九日電〕甘地今日抵達暴動賡續不已之新德里，未及一小時，即與印總理尼赫魯·內長巴台爾·衛生部長柯爾夫人等會晤，蒙巴頓特撥印度兵十二名任其衛隊，但甘地已予婉謝。甘地在加爾各答絕食後，元氣未復，體質仍弱，甘地抵德里後仍居於　褸之清道夫區域內，渠將於何時起為新德里之暴動而絕食，尚無表示，大局將視局勢之演變而定。</p>
<p>死者達千人以上　啄屍鳥成羣出現</p>
<p>皇家印度空軍已於今日起正式協助政府從事制止暴動，當甘地與尼赫魯等晤談時，飛機已出動在空中翱翔。德里動亂中之死者今日已增至一千人以上，此乃非正式之估計，官方並未發表過去廿四小時中之死傷數字。街頭未掩埋之屍體已發出惡臭，天空復出現成羣之啄屍鳥，由此可以想見城內恐怖狀况。德里之商業區，今日仍未復業，康腦脫馬戲場今日又發生暴動，警察開槍三次，當場擊斃十七人，此蓋本於當局之格殺勿論令而行動者。拉霍爾印度教徒之遷移雖已完成。然昨夜仍有暴徒縱火焚毀三條馬路間之房屋。加爾各答在令人不安的寗靜中，蓋甘地之離城，可能使流血慘劇再度發生。</p>

<h3>新仙林舞業大集會　數千舞女脂粉不施涕泣陳辭語不成聲　代表十二人定今晨飛京請願</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕禁舞期限轉瞬即屆，全市舞女，樂師，舞應從業員，及舞塲資方同感恐慌，昨晨九時特在新仙林舞應召開臨時大會，出席資方孫洪元，　煒顯，王靜文等，舞女孫志敏，孟燕，李玲等，中西藥師何海，阿拉娜司，關華石等，職工唐宗傑，毛志海等計二萬七千餘人。大會秩序由軍警協同職工會糾察　隊維持，黨政軍各方亦均派有代表參加，新仙林中人頭攅動，內外無絲毫隙地，緊張熱烈，實爲本市舞業空前未有之盛大集會。</p>

<h3>直接稅局查帳員向商人勒索經過　張中原函參議會報告詳情</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議員兼中式木器商同業公會理事長張中原，前以直接稅局查帳員有舞弊情事，時向該局檢舉並報吿潘議長及政務委會雷秘書長等，此案揭露後，曾引起各界極大注意。張參議員昨特將稅局查帳人員對該業被查會員勒索受賄詳細經過，向市參議會報吿。原函稱：「本年八月十五日，中原以中式木器商業同業公會理事長資格，應直接稅局之通知，與理事朱劍霓，顧建廷三人，同往出席抽籤，照局方規定，公會會員二百家至四百家，每百家抽查三家，本業共計會員二百五十餘家，應抽查者七家，由稅局抽籤主持人提出名單一紙，計共二十五家，經中原查得內有八家，係非太業會員，當時聲明由該主持人予以剔除，故參加抽籤者只有十七家，中籤者得七家，開列如后：</p>

<p>（註）喬源泰號爲中式木器號，維曾填入會書後，尚未繳納會費，曾要求退會，公會未予許可。可。</p>
<p>十七日上午中籤商號，按稅局通知，定十八日晨送帳册到局候查。次晨（十八日）中原派本店司帳王文鎬，持帳册赴局，據回稱「查帳時查帳員多方</p>
<p>挑剔恫嚇，吹毛求疵，並聲言須補稅一億元之多」云云。旋又有被查之朱根記，張森茂等等經理先後至中原處報同前情，每家均須補稅數千萬至一億元不等。是日午後各商號由電話中接稅局職員鄒文龍邀約至京華酒家敍談，中原以本號全年營業額僅三億餘元，補稅額決無如此龐大數效，且耳聞其他各業，每有受彼輩索詐之傳說，今旣電話邀約，似屬跡近索詐，姑囑各商號負責人應約前往，探察眞相，務儘量數衍，如果確係索詐，中原自有應付辦法。於七時許，中原在大觀商塲接本店經理王詠庠電話云：「據經查本店帳册之王姓查帳員謂，本店至少應繳補稅及交際費一億元，並須中原親往面治，當時除派沈文彬（大觀商塲會計）代表前往，虛與周旋外，擬即</p>
<p>電話密吿樓局長，因樓局長住宅電話號碼無法探得，不得已電吿潘議長，復値議長外出，乃電邵參議員永生，楊參議員撫生及商會嚴秘書長諤聲等報吿上述情形，同時又接沈文彬電話報吿，謂補稅及所謂交際費，由一億元，初讓至八千萬元，現再减至最低額六千九百萬元」云云。中原仍囑與敷衍，延至明日再說，當晚十一時，沈文彬·張賢良及本店之張中會·王詠庠回至大觀商塲，僉稱「查帳員王仁堂約中原明午親自到局面洽一切」。次晨（十九日）八時半，中原與楊參議員撫生同車往謁議長，適議長在參議會主持兵役協會，即轉往參議會晋謁，約十一時，始見議長。是時商會徐理事長寄廎·市參議會項秘書長昌權·總工會水理事長祥雲等，均在座，議長等聞中原報吿後，均極憤慨，議長囑中原繼續處與妥洽，俟</p>
<p>取得確證再行舉發。當時中原即以電話通知沈文彬，仍代表中原，應王仁堂之約，與之妥洽，以期取得確證，約二時許，沈文彬與張賢良，同來報吿接洽經過，由二千九百萬元减至二千三百萬元談妥，（內以一千三百萬元補稅，於接得稅局通知後繳付，一千萬元所謂交際費，限至遲於後日（廿一日）總付，繳款地點，利率時以電話通知）等語，嗣其他各商號先後前來報吿，亦去均已談妥，計：</p>
<p>店號經理　補稅交際費</p>
<p>張森茂　張賢良　七百萬元　七百萬元</p>
<p>張萬泰　張壽麒　四百萬元　一千萬元</p>
<p>五福　曹才賡　四百萬元　一千萬元</p>
<p>朱根記　朱劍霓　五百萬元　九百萬元</p>
<p>張萬利　張中原　一千三百萬元　一千萬元</p>
<p>楊隆興　楊隆泉　七百萬元　七百萬元</p>
<p>喬源泰　喬方　註：未來報告原因如前註</p>
<p>廿一日上午張賢良·朱劍霓至中原處稱：「稅局鄒文龍頃來電話，約本日十一時繳付交際費，應如何辦理」，中原常囑張朱二君開付本器服務社大德錢莊支票五十萬元（原交際費總額六家，共計五千三百萬元，佯爲還價三百萬元，以示誠意），以期獲得證據，依照</p>
<p>預定計劃舉發。同日晚八時許，中原自外返大觀商塲後，經沈文彬·張賢良之介紹，始識王仁堂（即查本人主特之張萬利號帳册，並向本人代表沈文彬索賄之稅局查帳員），爾時在塲者有費參議員樹聲，大公社記者顧惠人等。王仁堂向中原聲稱：「樓局長現已派員查問此案，願將本人名下之交際費一千萬元退還」云云，中原因次日有無錫之行，當囑其仍與沈文彬接洽。廿三午夜十時，中原由爲返滬，據張賢良·朱劍霓吿稱：「本日上午，由稅局鄒文龍電話通知，約於十一時前付款地點一談，經如約前往，遇鄒文龍後，即由鄒文能交還戶名鄧某之成都銀行支票一紙，計票面五千萬元，同日下午二時，局方派繆某等二督導前來調查，聲稱行賄與</p>
<p>受賄同罪，囑簽書面具　證，我等只得照繕云云。廿四日晚由潘議長面囑中原與虞參議員舜，往見政務委員會雷秘書長震報吿經過事實，二十五日上午十時許，財政部特派姚視察主任曾　，萬視察賡年，亦前來詳細調查，並由萬視察筆錄，廿六日復經姚視察及邵專門委員慰祖，邀集朱根記，張萬泰，張森茂·五福·楊隆興等各當事人，分別詢問各紀錄在案，相應備文縷述本案經過情形，函請督查。</p>

<h3>美軍法庭提審馬萊午後宣告開始辯論</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕美軍事法庭昨晨九時開庭，繼續提審證人德社列脫及奧勃倫。據德杜列脫供稱：與却利認識已六年。八月一日前遇却利於霞飛路，渠表示想做一笨省力而賺錢之交易。八月一日又遇見却利與馬萊在匯中飯店酒吧內共酌。繼審奧勃倫，據供稱：八月一日早晨於南京路晤却利，渠謂本日下午有一筆容易賺錢之生意，祗有此種機會可自中國人手中拿錢，繼提被吿馬萊審問，其口供與前日書面供詞無出入，惟承認十八歲時，曾在芝加哥犯罪。至於槍殺余感孝之責任，則完全推在却利身上。正午休庭後，至午後一時半重開。檢察官提出各項問題，盤問篤萊。此時馬萊之態度殊不自然，比較重要之問題均沉思片刻，方能作極短之答覆。而吐音之低，不但旁聽席上難於聽得，即法庭上亦數次命速記員覆誦，始得　瞭其內容。法官對馬萊之供辭，似亦不感興趣，有一法官曾口嚼橡皮糖解悶。馬萊供辭中，堅稱却利持槍，但檢察官詢以何乎持槍時，竟不能答覆。並承認由渠將受傷流血之余盛由汽車中推出，却利在旁觀　，未加協助。</p>
<p>各法官提出問題檢察官詢問畢，由各法官提出問題，均由馬萊作簡單之　　，其要點爲；（一）馬萊由京來滬時，身畔僅有美金四元。（二）馬萊未返華前，却利曾允許其來滬後予以職業，但馬萊抵華後，却利即食言。（三）在與却利合作之前（指購余盛孝之金條），並未有人予以警告，勸其勿與却利共事。（四）八月一日午後與却利之見面，爲不期而過，事先並無約會。（五）將受傷之余盛孝擲出車外，全出於却利之威脅，當時渠雖未以槍口相向，但武器在却手，不敢反抗。此時被吿辯護人起立補充：馬萊乃於八月一日上午九時自京搭機來滬，十一時左右始抵達，主審官帕爾謨上校乃宣布，馬萊遏庭。</p>
<p>檢察官發表見解休息五分鐘，開始終結辯論。首先由檢察官根據本身之調查，及歸納各證人之口供，報吿該案之內容，謂馬萊與却利確定與此血案有關。兩人相識有年，平時感情尙好，故却利首爲馬萊尋覓工作。但自却利食言之後，兩人之關係因之惡化。今春馬萊之來華，費用完全自行搢露，故來滬後會以十日之時間，　訪却利，希望獲得補償，但以却利遷居而未果。馬萊在滬，無以謀生，遂加入美軍服務。八月一日馬于來來滬後，午後三時許至新麗珠酒吧，遂與却利相晤。此時馬萊連議購買金條五根，由却利出面與余盛　接洽，並由其租用汽車，最後發生滬靑公路上之血案。檢察官復稱：本人之見解，認爲此案涉及搶刦及謀殺，犯罪者應置之於法。</p>
<p>辯護人力攻却利言畢，被吿辯護人即起立爲馬萊辯護，認爲由余盛孝臨終時之所言，指却利爲凶手，而未提及「美國人字肅；根據法律，此事完全爲「一個人之行馬」（Individual　Act），而非共謀行動（Joiuteuterprise）。故如却利爲有罪，則馬萊即完全無罪，應予昭雪。且却利數次供詞中，矛盾迭見，破綻百出，而馬萊之數次供詞，則先後完全一致。故依法理而言，却利之供詞所指，不能認爲有效。辯論至此，已逾五時，主審官宣布退庭，今晨九時再開庭，彙集各種有關資料，予以詳盡之考慮後，再行判決。據旁聽者之觀察，終結辯論不致需時太多，但決定馬萊是否有罪之「秘密投票」，需有四分之三之絕大多數，故判決之宜布，或尙非旦夕間事。</p>
<h3>紗廠退出工協會胡伯翔稱無所聞</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者昨訪本市工業協會常務理事胡伯翔，叩詢日前全國紗廠聯合會理監事聯席會議中決議，令所屬會員退出工協一事，據胡氏稱：工業協會對於此事迄無所聞。又謂紡織業參加工協之單位甚衆，皆出於自動自願者，紡織業在工業協會中所佔之地位亦頗重要，如本市工協常務理事榮鴻元，係申新紗廠總經理，榮理事對工協會務十分熱心，決無「退出」之意云。</p>

<h3>福新廠米案開審張志學代人受過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市閘北光復路四二三號福新麵粉公司第一廠囤積食米四百廿石一案，自六月中旬由社會局送地檢處偵查後，被吿福新一廠無錫辦事處職員胡竹平，女靑年會幹事張志學，無鍻餘新米廠經理談方行，經地檢慮依非常時期糧食管理治罪條例提起公訴。該案昨在地院開審，以尙需調查，論改期再審。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕關於涉嫌被控之張志學部份，茲得秀其眞相如下：綠有裘振華，張育實，管王氏，張國基卞忠良等十人與張均　友好，本年一月間，會以友誼關係，聯合託由福新一廠廠長浦志遠購進食米四十九石，以備家屬需用，此中張志學部份僅佔四石，當時因居處狹小，由張商經浦廠長同意，暫存福新一廠。三月間社會局派員至該廠調查時，以張任職女靑年會，遂誤認該米爲女靑年會所購存，即指爲有違反糧食管理條例。裘等十人對此曾函社會局聲明事實眞相。據悉裘等諸人全部家屬人口共計有八十六人之多，以每人一日三餐需求一市升計算，則四十九石食米，尙不足二個月之用。張旣無牟利之企圖，竟以此區區之數而代人受過，實非始料所及云。</p>
<h3>志願兵不足征集壯丁　將採取間接抽籤辦法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市本年度征兵三千名以征集志願兵爲主，志願兵不足時，則將依法抽籤征集。惟本市幅員遼闊，及齡壯丁衆奪，直接抽籤，勢不可能，故將採行間接抽籤辦法。經國防部規定間接抽籤辦法，分爲兩種：（一）抽籤時如過少數現役及齡男子，不能親自到塲時，得由鄕（鎭）長代爲抽籤。（二）多數現役男子不願參加直接抽籤，或因情况不許，不克親自到場抽籤時，得由兵役協會代表抽籤。又訊：民政處已收到二十六個區內之由請緩征召壯丁名册，約計九萬六千餘人。</p>

<h3>希望節省糜費嘉惠清寒學子</h3>
<p>今天是「讀者助學金」徵募款的第十九天，　規定的限期來講，已經超過了二分之一以上，在這十九天裏面，一共只收到四千二百九十九萬六千元，這數目，約莫相當於我們的最後目標——十億元——的二十分之一弱，沒有疑問這數字離開預定的計劃實在相去太遠，假使像這肅的情形繼續下去，到期滿的時候，捐款的數額，決不會超過二億元的，到那時我們的計劃將不易全部實現，事實很明顯的告訴我們遭受厄運的，是廣大的正在殷切盼望救助的窮苦學生羣。在這社會上，每天有無數的富翁和豪土爲了奢淫樂，化去無數的金錢，狂歡一夕，也許能供給數十個窮苦學生一學期的學費，一席豪華的盛宴，也許是一個窮苦學生半年的餐費。</p>

<h3>粵漢路　大舞弊案　上下職員營私達廿五億之鉅</h3>
<p>〔中央社長沙七百電〕粵漢鐵路近發生一大貪污舞弊案，凡激路運輪系統各處處段長及各大站站長，均被毫連。緣該路貨運價自八月一日起增百分之二百，各大站站長乃利用機會，於八月一日以飾儘量起包裹標，然後收受商貨，延緩運出，前長沙東站長周貽芳，運輸段長李文濤，副段長周樹雄等，串通擅起包裹栗約五萬件，從中漁利逹二十五億元之鉅。該路運輸處畏連風翔，亦利用撥調車輛職權，每調車一輛，賄收五萬元，尤曲意庇護，分別將周李等人，調派他職，藉資掩飾，事爲該路警務處長蔣國棟查覺，即派幹員將燭李等人，自各所在地一併解押來長拘禁，全案刻正由該處遴派大良偵詢中。</p>
<h3>淄博礦區踏勘　博山窰業及料業</h3>
<p>〔本報博山五日航訊〕遠在七百餘年前的宋朝，博山就巳開始陶器的製造，當時出品多係黑色，至明季始有白色陶器出現。陶器所用原料焦賓石，硅石，長石等盛產於縣境北嶺山頭務店等處抗戰前，在最繁榮期間從事製造者達二百餘家，專營窰貨之大商號亦達百二十餘家。抗戰勝利後，博山被共匪三度「解放」，原有較大窰業，不受淸算，亦遭鬥爭，窰業因以一蹶不振，目下尚仍繼續出品者僅十餘家，而其中最具規模的即爲省營的「山東省模範窰業廠。」</p>
<p>山東省模範窰業廠的前身爲「山東省立窰業試騐廠」該廠創辦於民國廿年四月，廠設博山大柳坑，廿五年七月改今名，由年僅廿八歲的靑年工程師王澄科任廠長，當王廠長蒞任之始，恰在共匪第二次撤退之後，　路藍縷，百廢待舉，在他苦心撐劃，慘淡經營下，至同年九月，已規模粗具，開始出品，至本年二月廿三日共匪第三次進人博山前，該廠已可</p>
<p>大量出貨計月出瓷器廿一萬件（內三分之二爲電瓷）耐火磚卅萬塊，（異型磚在內），所有製磁應有之櫗器設備如臥式鍋爐，水管式鍋爐，立式臥式汽機，碾，球磨，鐵碗機，鋼磚土粉碎機等皆已設置齊全，其製造程序大致如下</p>
<p>（一）原料－粉碎機－轉輪粉碎機－不過磨粉碎機－泥泵－泥漿壓榨機—橫式攪拌機。</p>
<p>（二）成坯—造模—造坯—錠坯—整理。</p>
<p>（三）施猾—噴　，盪　，浸　。</p>
<p>（四）燒威造爐盆—裝窰—燒窰—出窰—檢選。</p>
<p>（五）彩晝（貼花，繪晝，刷花。）烤花—成品。，</p>
<p>除陶瓷器及化工材料製造（如各種耐火，耐酸，矽，鎂鈣磚）外，在計劃中的，該廠並擬於本年下半年起增設玻璃製造部，同時已成立之研究室亦擬大加擴充，傳隨時分析，測定，並研究各種原料之組成，而有所改進，詎奈本年二月，共匪三度「解放」博山，至同年八月十七日撤退時，將所有珍貴儀器，化學藥品，磁用顏料。</p>

<h3>吳開先召集米業代表　商討民食調配問題　各地到源充沛米價無上漲理由</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民食調配委員會主委吳開先氏，昨日下午四時，召集本巿米商業同業公會負責人，商討本市食米間題。出席萬墨林·瞿振華·徐虹仁·張超·胡咸鐲·等二十餘人，由吳兼主委主席。報告本市民食調配情形，　討論有關本市供應事件，至六時許散會。</p>
<p>又悉：民食調配委員會，將成立儲運處，幷委託各米商分向各產地採購食米，該會對所採購之白米，將予押款週轉，此項原則，各米商將於今日召開會議，磋凸　細辦法，俟吳局長返滬決定云。</p>
<p>政府決定加緊配給</p>
<p>又訊：據悉本市米價，最近上漲原因有三：（一）因漢口軍事會一度緊張，因此封江，致運輪不暢。（二）蕪湖米大量出口，私運華北。（三）新米尚未上市，靑黄不接時期，尚未過去。但現在漢口已停止封江，運輸暢通。蕪湖亦於上星期三，由行政院命令嚴禁出口華北各地。新米亦已逐漸登塲，故米價只有日趨平穩。</p>
<p>同時就本市供應方面言，民食調配委員會，每月需米廿萬石，公教人員配售約三萬石，住軍軍糧與警察糧配給約二萬五千石，故本市每月供應共有廿五萬餘石。若上海以四百五十萬人口計，每月僅需米四十五萬石。現政府之供給量，已有廿五萬餘餘石，所缺不過廿萬石左右。而各地到米數重，亦可超逾此數，故供應亦毋處匱乏。所以米價再漲，實乏理由。且政府現決定：（一）繼續加緊配給，（二）管制市塲，（三）减少米價上漲因素，（四）擴充食米來源。聞現巳與美國訂妥十二萬噸美麥，待技術問題談妥，九月份即可開始裝運。又緬甸米三萬噸，暹羅米九萬噸，現正洽談中。</p>
<p>此外，美國方面尚有米四萬三千噸，以上米麥進口，估計需美金六千餘萬元，榮經政府籌措就緒。故食米來源，已無問題。因之在新米上市以後，米價將趨下跌。惟米價過低，將形成榖賤傷農、亦非善策。聞政府在秋收後，將考慮在產米區收購糧食，以備將來調劑之用，惟收購時以不影響市價爲原則。目前上海存米，尚有數十萬包，麵粉存量亦頗豐，故供應決不致發生部題。</p>
<p>薄稻銷旺價見上升</p>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧七千二百餘石，粳米早薄稻去化仍活，續漲三五千至萬元。秈米新陳均有到貨，且來源踵接，銷路仍淡，依然高定次疲。形勢粳秞背道而馳。白元新梗定局，香粳米初次見新。</p>
<p>麵粉配價雖然不動，但原料昂貴，雜牌粉因成本過高，不肯賤脫，形趨暗緊。麩皮挺牢，豆餅銷路溝淡，仍然不振。黄豆汕廠客方不動，惟本街另化轉殷，微升三四千元。茶豆萎靡之狀，元麥來實若斷若續，價無幹輊。</p>
<p>紅糧到銷兩接，價形平定。苞米北洋揀高拾取，挺升六七千元，中次少神乏交，勢則高俏疲。芝蔴廣帮問津，疲而轉定。生仁一蹶不振，再跌萬元。蠶豆來去兩稀，市面平席。</p>
<p>油市升沉互有，豆油去化俏利，價升萬元。生油呆滯之極，績疲萬元。蔴油平平，菜油堅挺，淸油牢硬。</p>
<h3>麵粉市塲今日正開做</h3>
<p>麵粉商業同業公會，於今日上午十時起，開拍市塲交易。推定市塲管理委員十一人，調解委員五人，參加人塲同業約有百餘家。麵粉交易，賣買雙方居間人佣金每袋規定國幣二百元。進出雙方，各出半數。業已訂定市塲管理規則，送請社會局核示。</p>
<h3>內銷紅茶成交　昨約二百五十箱</h3>
<p>蘇錫一帶久思動辦之紅茶。昨日市上，已趨前與賣戶磋商，迨至收市，約有二百五十餘箱，獲得成交，惟大都係低檔陳貨，價每批自卅六萬五千元至四十萬元，市氣賡續堅穩。共他花色，本街店莊及客帮等地，去化雖乏　額，但仍朱歛跡，做開行情，因供售者扳持如故，各不稍綏。至於洋莊茶市，過程猶殊岑靜，良以進出雙方俱在趦趄中。</p>
<p>頃據同業消息：向受英國埀愛之祁門紅茶，刻下彼地對於本年度新茶，更有垂靑之意，惜出價依然慳吝，情况遂難開如。茲聞在裕泰。午昌。華茶。等公司，均擬致電海外，請求加價，至可能與否，一時尚難逆料。</p>
<h3>人造絲平穩</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市依然平穩，交易淸稀。上午一二〇號有光金三馬及天橋喊價二千五百七八十萬元，迄中午成交價爲五百八十萬元，賣出價爲六百萬元，下午成交價爲五百九十萬元，東洋喊六百萬元，結果比上日好起十萬元。</p>
<p>廠經昨市仍只有另担交易，成交價與上日相同。干經開口貨另扣價在一千八百五十萬元左右。郷貨眞絲被面因略有銷路，昨價堅挺，比上日火起五萬元。大誠興華强市價　參差，格子璧縐仍喊四萬〇五百元，並無成交。</p>
<h3>秦島煤斤待運來滬</h3>
<p>〔本報南京九日電〕截至八月二十一日爲止，秦皇島待運出口之煤斤總數，已達六〇六八〇噸，此對電源缺乏之上海。當極重要。經部據報後，已電飭上海區燃管會，迅速派船接運。</p>
<h3>銀樓營業費用　吳局長認爲太高</h3>
<p>本市銀樓業代表，昨日下午四時，赴社會局謁吴局長，面陳關於各銀樓恢復飾金交易之營業費川，及合法利潤之要求，其所列明營菜費用爲百分之四十，（包括捐稅，藥水·火工·職員厘金·包紥·套色·印模·工料損失·其他佔百分之十五·利息佔百分之二十五，）利息百分之二十，總計爲百分之六十，聞吳局長到是項費用，認爲太高，將俟吳民返京再行商洽。</p>
<h3>紡調開臨時委員會　發營廠紗布外銷原則可接受</h3>

<h3>紗布實銷發動　昨行情均見挺高</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以實銷發動，交易頗暢，行情均見抬高。四二支藍鳳紗結果做高至一千八百卅五萬元，此上日回漲六十五萬元。，</p>
<p>昨棉布實銷漸旺，業中人止吐轉進，散戶進意更濃，市勢直綫向上，結果龍頭細布因各方扒吸，抬高至五十萬零八千元，比上日績漲一萬元。</p>
<p>紡建售布　〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例開售棉布廿三種，被單一種，配價與前相仿。昨因布市頗俏，故前往由購者極形踴躍。經核配者計廠商三七戶，配布三八八〇疋。布號一三六一張，配布四六九六〇疋，被單一二一〇條。廿支特細布，掛價卅九萬二千，加價一萬有人吸收。直貢元　嘰加四六千元，人心趨堅。</p>
<h3>麵粉轉口放行證　由糧部直接核發</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕麵粉轉口限額辦法，自粮食都公佈以來，屬於江蘇省曁京滬財地各廠限額八月份報運數總額共計六十萬袋，分配二六廠。其間靦新茂新阜豐華盤裕通等五大廠佔總額之半數。上次分配比率，業由四區麵粉工業同業公會奉緝部指定，依照各廠實開工生產量，百分之三四，八九核定其報運額。上次報遝轉口放行證，四區公會前爲便利各會員由請起見，呈請糧部將轉口證發交公會轉發各廠。惟日久未奉批復，乃推派該會常務理事錢鍾漢赴京要求。錢氏業已返滬，對公會要求轉口證業總轉發一點，糧部未能照准。各廠八月份核定之報運額申請發給轉口證乎續，業經糧部核定，由各廠自行備文向該部直接申請核發，並由公會蓋章證明。又九月份報運轉口限額，瞬即將到，各廠應將每日實際產量，查照糧部前頒表格，按旬列表塡送，由會轉部核定。如渝期不送，或不按句塡報者，作爲自願放棄論。</p>
<h3>紡織生產會議開首次籌備會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕經濟部召開之全國紡織工業生產會議，由經部聘定該部在滬各機關首長，爲籌備委員，共廿三人，於八日下午四時，舉行第一次籌備會議，由穎葆常主席。到李升伯蔡無忌綜十九人（一）通過籌備會組織親則。（二）通過出席生產會議委員名單共二百餘人。。決定本月廿五，廿六，廿七日爲會議日期。（四）聘請紡織機器，紡織技術，紡織原料，複製業，紗廠聯合會會員，及有關紡織教育貿易，曁其他各方面紡織專家，出席會議。（五）決定大會商討範圍，爲紡織工業生產事宜。聞大會會塲，目前正在商談中。</p>
<h3>現棉續漲</h3>
<p>昨日現棉因紗廠進意不濃，出價不高。同業人心堅挺，交易甚旺，全日成交二千四百餘包。各增價格較上日軋升三四萬，午後做開送廠價　賓二三三萬五千，沙市二一七萬，二二〇萬，漢口細絨二一七萬。又棧交價　米特林二二二萬，靈賓二二〇萬，二二五萬，二三〇萬，二三三萬五千。特級米特林二五〇萬，沙市二一五萬，二一八萬，漢細二〇六萬，二一二萬，二一五萬。冲通一九六萬，周浦籽花三四萬五千。</p>
<h3>金鈔黑市買賣　告密獎金變更計算</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自黄金美鈔收兌價格公佈後，關於黑市買賣告密獎金之計算，有無變更，記者昨特向國行探詢。據悉：按照告密黄金外幣買賣獎勵辦法規定，告密人之獎金，係以沒收品變價折合國幣計算。茲黄金美鈔兌價，已有新規定，自應依照政府新定收兌價格計算辦理。至黑市外匯電滙，一經破獲，其沒收之　據，亦應比照外幣給獎，以資鼓勵云。</p>
<h3>統債虛軟外股續俏</h3>
<p>公僓昨統丁尚平，餘者均已低落，統丙晨開一四四〇〇元，高價不過一四五〇〇元，退至一三八〇〇室元收市。潤德五五〇室五三八室均進，大成新五〇三室五五五室均出。結果較前收計甲乙戊各跌六〇〇元，統丙亦降八〇〇元，統丁獨平，成交仍僅六百萬右左。</p>
<p>外股昨網續見俏，廣帮及銀行帮再吸業廣，該股獨升較多。怡紗有銀行帮力吸五千股，大康成證券帮洋行帮均出。怡紗晨開九〇八〇〇元，高價不過九二九〇〇元，退至九二〇〇〇元光景收市。結果較前收計怡紗英聯會德豊航業電話微升，業廣紙業鋼業各漲半成，祥泰漲一成弱。</p>
<h3>交易續見寥落　華股起伏狹隘</h3>
<p>華股昨仍無生氣，塲外因拆除電話工作，織繪加緊查詢，使亨同活動，無形遭受牽制。塲內交易，亦續見寥落，除因外匯及外股兩方之間接輕微刺激，多方一一六號一五二號頑强抵抗外，仍呈一片疏　氣象。惟收後尚有餘風，喊價稍疲，新光景福在中途雖略受環境束縛，高後略回，但籌碼涸竭，收價尚易支撐。</p>
<p>晨開見昂，視永紗開後，經一〇號等買進，升至二四一元，三六號二二三號均賣，退至二三八元後，聞外匯牌價稍有變動，一一六號等來進，買氣稍蘇，而回升至二四四元。二二三號一四號依然力售，退至二四一元，無如外股續挺，塲外息價開低至一角二分及一角六分半，一一六號二二號等購買，漲高到二四五元。惟塲外檢查對講電話工作加嚴進行，活動力量不免遭受打擊。一〇五號等脫售，九九號亦供給現永紗，逐漸盤低至二三九元左右。延至十一時半後，一五五號等乘低來買，二一八號出後亦進，午收永紗以二三九元及二四一元之價結束，收後喊價趨昂。</p>
<p>結果較前收即交股計新光景福永紗信和美亞微升，華體微挫，新華勤興永公平平，中法火柴各跌半成，榮盟大通景綸麗安均平，內衣中紡微升，中絲商務小挫。遞交股計豐跌半成，永紗信和新光景福勤興微升，美亞尚平，場外各老股尚見穩健。</p>
<h3>遞交交易請予展延</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市證券交易所，以財經兩部核定該所試辦遞交交易三個月之限期，即將於本年九月底屆滿，特於上週間函陳財經兩部，請准再予展延。並將「試辦」字樣取銷，不再加以時間上之規限。又該所定今日下午四時，召開常務理事會議云。</p>

<h3>風雨之夜</h3>
<p>— 藍蕙</p>
<p>從遙遠突元的峯極，將視綫盪過一些藍浪似的起伏的崗　，投到那昆戎江大轉灣的地方，便可以看到幾幢洋房，像鳥龜一樣依偎在它的身旁；那便是志華中學。</p>
<p>天飄着雨。時間，已經很晚了，號聲早已明白宣佈：下午最後一堂課業已結束。</p>
<p>女生苗錦瑩，一面籟籟刷響着書頁找東西，一面掉過頭去對坐在後排的牛維能說：</p>
<p>『牛同學，你爲什麼一個人坐在敎室裏，不同他們一路出去玩』？</p>
<p>『唔』，他停下了筆，把眼光投向窗外，打了一個哈欠，說：『外邊在下雨，路是泥濘的，出去也沒有什麼可玩處，倒不如坐在敎室里溫習下功課好些』。</p>
<p>『唉，這是你們用功學生的看法』。她讚頌地說，又微微地一笑；一封信，從她翻着的書本裏，像落葉一樣飄到牛維能的脚上。他很快地覺察到了，伏下身</p>
<p>——『苗錦瑩小姐啓』，那信是她的！還沒有拆；他連忙站</p>
<p>『苗同學』！他把信遞給了快要跨出敎室門口的她，再回到自己座位上。</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>夜。</p>
<p>敎室裏，充滿着桐油烟子，燻染着一些年靑人的生命。</p>
<p>校役在敎室門外傳令：『牛維能同學——那位是牛維能同學？訓育主任請』！</p>
<p>聽見是訓育主任，眞有點使人頭痛：他那副冷酷得像冬天一樣的面孔，呌人看見不寒而慄；他是從不輕易喊同學去說話的；今天該不會是禍事吧？牛維能擱下書本，懷着一顆懼怕，多少有點驚惶的心，在屋角拿了一把雨傘，走向辦公室去……</p>
<p>『報吿』！</p>
<p>『進來』。</p>
<p>他胆怯的走近辦公桌前，規規矩矩的向訓育主托行了個禮。</p>
<p>訓育主任好像沒有看見他進來似的，仍然低着頭自顧自的在批寫着什麼；好久好久，才慢慢的抬起頭來，冷冷地說：</p>
<p>『唔，牛維能你來哪』！</p>
<p>『是，主任』。心，拍拍地跳着，他儘量地鎭靜自己，恭敬地回答。</p>
<p>『你知道俗話有句：「小池畜不了飛龍」『那句話嗎』？訓育主任用一種含意深長的眼光固執的盯着牛維能。</p>
<p>『知道』。他惘然地回答。</p>
<p>『你懂得：大丈夫敢作敢爲那句話的意義』？訓育主任緊逼着又問。</p>
<p>『懂得』。</p>
<p>『！呵那就好了』。訓育主一任忍地站起身來，一個胸有成竹一的微笑顯現在他的嘴角上，聲音一一個字一個字地吐出來：『那嗎一，現在你就下去，收拾行李，明一天一早離開雄校』。</p>
<p>『爲什麼』？牛維能一震。</p>
<p>一個淡然的回答：『學校要開除你』。</p>
<p>『我做錯了什麼事情』牛維能的心要碎了；他像突然遭了一棒，全身的血都往頭上衝；但他極力的忍住內心情感的激動。</p>
<p>『大丈夫做錯了事，應該挺身承當；你看，你這裝起二百錢數不活的樣子就……，』訓育主任開始來回地在室內踱方步。</p>
<p>『什麼裝起二百錢數不淸？我到底做錯了什麽事情？』像前一樣嚴厲的質問。</p>
<p>『自己知道』。仍是冷冷的回答。</p>
<p>『學校不能這樣沒有理由的隨便　亂開除人呀？』像爆發的火山，牛維能憤激地叫；此刻他心中有的只是自信而坦白，剛才的沉重的恐懼早已消失得無影無踪了。</p>
<p>『沒有理由，哼』！訓育主任停止了踱步，原來死板板的臉上現在更罩了一層可怕的陰森，牙縫裏逼出這幾個字：「吿訴你：苗錦瑩吿發了你」！</p>
<p>『什麼』？</p>
<p>『苗錦瑩吿發了你」！訓育主任不耐煩地重述一遍，隨即緊閉了嘴，彷彿責任已了，再不願多說一個字了似的；接着便仰起頭來，兩眼瞪着屋頂出神。</p>
<p>『主任…』。牛雜能嘴唇抖索着。</p>
<p>「不用多說』！訓育主任不屑地揮了揮手，又以手指門：『現在你下去，這事我也作不了主；候校長來了再決定一切。——我已經派人去請校長去了』。</p>
<p>風雨，帶着泥沙，呼呼地往牛維能身上吹打，眼前只是一片混沌的黑暗呵！像海一樣的深沉</p>
<p>懷着一縷迷茫的情緒，進了敎室；迎面來的是那個在班上號稱多嘴大王的張澤堯，一碰頭就是開門見山：</p>
<p>『牛維能！訓育主任喊你做甚麽」？</p>
<p>牛維能沒有回答，對直走向苗錦瑩。</p>
<p>『嘖嘖，不得了了！訓育主任請說了話哪』！沒有得到回話的張澤堯，不滿意的在背後咕嚕</p>
<p>『苗同學！你爲什麼事情吿我』？牛維能的聲音激動得發抖</p>
<p>苗錦瑩吃驚的站了起來，呆了一會又癱瘓的坐了下去，伏在桌案上哭了起來；……………</p>
<p>全班同學的目光，都一齊集注在他們二人的身上；………</p>
<p>……………………。</p>
<p>校長來了，牛維能再度被傳進了辦公室。</p>
<p>「就是這樣決定』！校長對訓育主任說，然後轉渦臉來向着他：『牛維能，學校決定開除你』。</p>
<p>『決定開除我』？牛維能有點不相信自己的耳朶；但這是事實呀！黑沉沉的辦公室，一盞像鬼火似的菜油燈，閃爍着校長和訓育主任兩張猙獰的面孔。</p>
<p>『嗯。決定開除你，是的，一個年靑人往往感情容易衝動，………古人也有過「人非聖賢孰能無過』這句話，即使是聖賢也難免沒有過錯呀！走錯了路，沒有關係，回頭是岸，可以重新走過；你好好回去，讓家庭生活洗滌一下你的胸襟，對你或許………』…」</p>
<p>『我不回去！學校憑什麽可以開除我』？無比的憤怒占有了他，牛維能打斷了校長的話頭說</p>
<p>『憑什麼？有證有據』！校長冷冷地答。</p>
<p>『證據在那裏』？憤怒更高揚起來，牛維能的身子因激動而顫抖，聲音也震動得厲害，眼睛燃燒着白熱的火。</p>
<p>『你看你自己這樣子！也是學生對師長應有的態度麼』？訓育主任斜睨着牛維能忿昂的說，又看了校長一眼。</p>
<p>『好，拿給他自己看』。</p>
<p>訓育主任遵命的從辦公桌的抽屜裏，拿出一張西式信箋遞給牛維能。</p>
<p>瑩——</p>
<p>你說：誰不愛鮮艷的玫瑰？誰不愛濃郁芬芳的薔薇？…………………好花不常開，好景不常在』！靑春之一門是不會永遠爲遲疑的人開放，塋！爲了造物者的賜予，我希望在那個幽靜的白水公園的楊柳湖畔，我們能有一次春天的約會！阿門。</p>
<p>不知到底是怎麼一回事，牛雜能看冤魂了那張西式信笺上的每個字，茫然無聲的把它交還給訓育主任。</p>
<p>「現在，你下去凖備一切，限明天午前十鐘離開學校」！校長劃燃了一根火柴，點上了一枝香烟，仰起頭吐着圈子，一邊泰然的說。</p>
<p>「校長！我……」。</p>
<p>「不用多說，出去！這是校規」！訓育主任怒叱着，把牛維能推出了辦公室。一</p>
<p>回到教室　自己的坐位，能深深地埋着頭，用震抖的手蒙着臉，心頭上浮蓋着一層難以形容的苦澀。</p>
<p>牛維能要被開除的消息，像一一自己的偉論：『我說嘛，老好人專門做傻事！你看他整天手不釋卷，你以為他在用功吧？嘿嘿！錯了，其實不然，他在………嘿嘿，「妹妹我愛………愛你」；所以我說，一天捧着書本唸的，都不是好東西！————你，你，一就是屬於這一類的』。接着，並一以一個手指點着身邊的一位同學，於是全敎室里的男同學都哄然了起來。</p>
<p>『放你的狗屁！去你媽的喲』！被指點着那一位高聲反抗。</p>
<p>「知人知面不知心，人面獸心的東西』！</p>
<p>『阿彌陀佛，去他媽的！少了一個甲等生，「不才」也要進一名』！…………</p>
<p>同學們的閒言惡語，像一陣飛揚的驟風，不住的往他耳邊吹刮；一片毒火在牛維能的心胸燃燒呀，悲痛與憎惡奪去了他整個的心緒，他再也忍受不住了，他一站起身來，奔過去，應手把敎室一門拉開，讓風雨迎面撲來，他跑了出去……</p>
<p>夜；深沉的夜！雷電混合着暴風雨，從那渺茫的虛幻，擺動着無理智的鞭子，譜奏出一隻凄苦的曲子。……</p>
<p>次日，風雨停了。</p>
<p>辦公室前的佈吿牌上，張貼着一張新佈吿，短短的幾句：</p>
<p>「査本校X班學生牛維能，品行不正，着予除名，以警效尤！此佈』。</p>
<p>佈吿牌前站着一堆同學，多嘴大王張澤堯也擠在裏面，正在指手劃脚的說：『唉，牛維能昨晚上整夜沒有回寢室睡哩！他的床舖挨着我，到天亮都是空　也的』。</p>
<p>『據一個漁夫說，在今天早上，他曾看見有一個死屍浮在河上………』另一個同學報吿新聞，並且加以推測。…………</p>
<p>這時，有一個神色倉惶的同學，氣喘喘地跑進了辦公室。</p>
<p>辦公室裏，校長正悠閑的抽着香烟，訓育主任安然的在踱方</p>
<p>『校長，給苗錦瑩的那封追求信，是我寫的！』</p>
<p>像一個響亮的春雷，校長駭然僵硬了，訓育王任停下了脚步；他們二人的身子都在發抖，一時間都呆住了。</p>
<p>辦公室外而，掀起了一片無限的沉痛與憤怒的　浪。</p>
<p>……………………。</p>
<p>在生鄧的花園裏，有一株美好的果樹，被暴風雨摧毀了。……………</p>
<h3>布洛克演講集</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>最近英國林德賽（Lindsay）新譯蘇聯詩人布洛克（Alexander　Blok，1880－1921）的演講集，共計六篇。書名「音樂的精神」（The　Spirit　of　Music），頗易使人誤會，其實並不是專談音樂的。布洛克音樂的精神的意思，多少有一點基督徒所謂「聖靈」之意。他在革命前說起一般人缺乏這種精神。</p>
<p>這些演講顯然都是在革命時期演述的，對於基督敎義，闡揚得頗爲明顯。可惜譯者不曾選些布洛克美麗的詩篇來譯，實是一個損失。</p>
<p>但是這本書也有談到音樂的，那就是第三篇演講「藝術與革命」，布洛克想把華格涅（Wagoner）與蘇聯共產主義聯繫起來，通過馬克斯和恩格斯的宣言，嘲笑一般「竊笑的女人們和冷淡的官員」，他們想要「餓死華格湼」。布洛克喊呌道“「革命之聲在空中震蕩的時候，華格湼的藝術就是一個堅强的回答。」</p>
<p>但後來蘇聯又以爲華格湼，莫扎德，斐多汶這些音樂大師與政治無關，他們都是上層階級的藝術，應在査禁之列。不過最近對於這些樂聖又尊崇起來了。</p>
<p>這集子除政治圈外，並不能增加布洛克的聲譽，爲補救缺陷起見，我們應該在不久的將來，把他的詩好好地翻譯出來。</p>
<h3>烏尤寺</h3>
<p>— 葉鼎洛</p>
<p>——嘉州六記之二</p>
<p>來嘉州，就能許多朋友說起烏尤寺和大佛寺是此地的名勝。</p>
<p>曾經也遊過許多名勝之地。所謂名勝，實在並不一定是特別出奇的地方，不過經過某一時代的某一個有名人物的標舉。因此，後代的人，都慕名面到這裏來遊覽。標舉名勝的古人，大都是出自一時的感興，遊覽名勝的今人，也大都是發乎忽然之逸趣。所以，所謂名勝區，其實好像是一盆假山，是供人賞玩的一角之地，其價値實在不及眞正出產農作物的鄕村對於人羣之重要。然而，名勝畢竟也是許多人經營起來的地方。</p>
<p>在如此惡劣的時局之下，能够有那　一天，忘懷於一切目前和將來的憂患，到山林之間去放肆地亂走，實在是人生難得的淸福，這無須乎多大的本錢，而且不必和人發生鬥爭的事，爲什麽不幹呢？</p>
<p>早晨，被鄰居提到了一個賊的鬧聲吵醒，並非巡警的我，覺得沒有渦問此類事件的必要，而又怕聽這種不起快感的聲音，急急起來，鎖上門，找到一個朋友，相將的去遊烏尤寺。</p>
<p>在街上買了些乾糧，走出嘉定南部瀕水的安瀾門，如畫的江山，使我憑去身後的一片喧鬧的城市，和朋友暫立在碼頭上，看無數的船隻，在江邊的波濤中掀躍；過江的人羣，和無數船夫，又鬧出一片震耳的繁響。</p>
<p>從碼頭下的亂石灘頭，跨上一隻小蓬渡船，船夫順着水勢，搖向上游的岸邊，然後放入中流，讓水將船冲向對岸的山脚下去。坐在船上，隨着波濤的起伏，看一片碧浪滔滔的岷江和大渡河交流之處的江水，無數的波船，就在這念流中玩具似的浮過；大佛寺和烏尤寺的磯石山頭，像兩座巨屛，漸漸地逼向目前，我覺得很是壯觀。</p>
<p>船從大佛寺的山脚下浮過，在兩座石壁之問巍然立着的大佛，遠遠望見了。因爲，雖說是在山脚下，其實相距尙遠，所以能望見，如果眞是在大佛的座下，只能望見佛身基下的長着亂樹的一部，將江上的船和山間的大佛相比，只能說是一隻螞蟻在一隻竹筍下面走過的樣子吧？</p>
<p>船近島尤寺山脚，看見石山脚上的磯石上，被無數年來，無數的船上的無數竹篙上的鐵鏃　成的無數的石眼，有幾條像被銼子銼出的石縫，是被無數年來的水力冲成的。水的力量實在比山的力量大，但那山，無數年來仍是屹立着不動。</p>
<p>捨船登岸，從沙灘走向石級，曲折上山，四川特有的細而高而向四面灣去的竹叢，是夾道而立的械物；這中間原有許多其他的大樹。石級上長着蒼苔，使人感到走進一個綠色的綱裏來了，這正是一個不很晴朗的秋日，空氣中有點潮濕。在半山的凉享中坐下，看壁上的石刻，看見遊山的並不止我和朋友兩個人，正有許多學生和公務人員的家庭，走上山來，更有許多賣吃食和送餐事的人，自然，這裏旣然不是我和朋友的私產，而到這裏來遊覽的人，又無須購門券，所以，即使是陰天，爲什麼不熟鬧呢？</p>
<p>從這裏再走上山去，走盡石級，有打掃得乾凈的土道，直達烏尤寺的山門，說是山門，比各地的衙門　華多了。這廟宇，實在相當的富麗，使它富麗的倒不是所謂莊嚴的佛像，古式的殿宇，而是許多彩漆輝煌的匾額和對聯。有了精工的宗敎性的標語和招牌，正像一爿新開的舖面，使我們知道，此地的和尙，也已經具有商人的頭腦，借佛的勝地，營茶坊，飯館，旅社性質的買賣了。究竟在現代，燒香，佈施的大施主已經减少，一些光頭的漢子，不做達官，貴人，土豪，富紳的侍者，他吃什麽呢？</p>
<p>我們在他們的客廳中吃了乾糧和茶水，買了幾張碑帖，後面的羅漢堂是可以多留一會的地方，因爲，遊廟的還有更多的男女，這廟已經成了交際塲，無從交際的我們，只好去看土偶的呆相。在五百尊成排而坐的羅漢的中間，走道的交叉處塑着濟顚和瘋僧的造像。這兩個故事中的且有社會性，瘋刺性的窮和尙，被許多人　爲羅漢投胎的漢子，其實是人類中熱腸直性的人，旣看不起世外高人，又悲憫世間的流品，所以纔胡說八道，而又怕砍頭，只得裝瘋賣傻，也許有的。然而那塑像，實在不能，傳達出這種苦悶的精神。</p>
<p>羅漢堂的中心塑着烏尤神的像，這鳥尤寺即是烏尤神的寺，烏尤之名，究不知何自而來，據說，常初因爲觀世音菩薩，起了凡心，於是變成面目可憎的怪物。這無從稽考的傳說和名稱，我和許多遊客一樣，沒有本領去解釋。從羅漢堂走出來，天空中放出了晴光。在城裏動身之前，聽說這裏住着一個也可以說是窮儒的學者，知客和尙打聽，知道他已經走了，我們的遊興，於是移向了大佛寺。</p>
<h3>「土鏽腥」</h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>丙子夏月，與諸友夜憩松江大有農塲，歸作一律，其兩聯云：「明月照翻千葉柳，凉風吹亂一池星；境幽轉覺蛙聲寂，夜靜徵聞土鏽腥。」土鏽腥三字，似頗生澀，實則非我作古，迺賢鐵牛廟詩：『角斷苔花碧，蹏　土　腥』已先我道之　。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>也許風聲太緊，時機不利，耀羣始終沒發見一個同志的踪跡（尋覓同志的方式；一，疑似—全仗觀察力，並無顯明符記。二，暗號；三，特殊動作；四，隱語；五，過渡對白，這五個步驟，是同志互相接近的方式）本來像天津偌大一個市面，工作同志不過十幾名，哪裏能隨時隨地碰到？不過「法租界」是總部指定的駐劄區域，耀羣希望能遇見一二人罷了。</p>
<p>走過幾家旅舍，關羣挑選了中國餝飯店，凑巧二十七　房間空着，便預付過了十元房金，將　召定下了。這裏，因有法人關係，日寇及日寇鷹犬，侵入不深，除了茶房請　羣塡寫了一張姓名和來踪去跡的登記表之外，並無其他煩麻。耀羣在姓名項下，只寫了　小姐三圖字。</p>
<p>這二十七號就在底層後一進，因旅社門外，還沒有做下暗記，旅客姓名，一時不見得登在「一覽」牌上，耀羣恐怕小老虎回來得快，尋找起來麻煩，便跑到大門口故意向旅客招待問話，一面等着小老虎，一面預備瞧一個機會，在大門外印上階記。這個暗記，凡是老寨的人都知道遝用</p>
<p>耀羣正向招待問了兩句話，只見日影一晃，大門外走進了一個「人」。人罷咧，爲什麽給它加上一個括弧符號？這是表現這傢伙太不尋常：乍一看，絕對無法規定它是男是女，因它的行動，氣派，體格，姿態，等等，一切都像男人，然而穿着和打扮，却是女式—襯衫，短裙，長統襪，半高跟皮鞋，高胸肺，外帶隱隱隱約約地　個　　—同　，他更　法斷定是什麼　族或國籍：高鼻凹目，再加棕黑色的捲髮，現出一個西人的輪廓，但是臉盤，眼珠，神情等等又有很濃厚的東方色調。</p>
<p>「您辛苦哪，」這不男不女，不中不西的傢伙，一進大門就對兩個招待招呼着。這一開口，更把驚奇得像看見了希希哈的耀羣益發感覺驚奇了：因這傢伙的一口流麗京腔，和西洋人的說話韻味，和那尖脆而又帶着沉重膛音的嗓子，在在都成了一種對較；換句話，純粹的中國話，却帶着洋味；淸脆的女音，却滲和着男子的脫音。在對旅舍招待打招呼的時候，却有意無意對耀羣一　牙，笑迷迷地點了一個頭</p>
<p>這半另半女，半中半西的混合玩意一進門，兩個招待就像接到了動員令似的，一個搶先朝裏跑去，一個陪着那傢伙邊說邊向裏走。　羣趁這空檔，便赶忙跨出了大門。她預備先做下了暗記，再來欣賞那個希希哈玩意見；她的責任心勝過了好奇心。</p>

<p>President Chiang's Opening Speech</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] At the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session and the Joint Conference of the Party and League on the 9th, President Chiang personally presided and delivered a speech, stating: Today is the opening day of the Fourth Plenary Session of our party and also the anniversary of the Guangzhou Uprising led by the Premier in the year of Yiwu (1895). Looking back over the past fifty years, countless revolutionary martyrs and comrades of our party, under the leadership of the Premier, shed their blood and sacrificed their lives, and struggled arduously, laying a deep foundation for the revolutionary cause of our party. Today, on this great anniversary, all party members and league members should reflect upon themselves, strive hard, and strive to carry forward the glorious history of our party and complete the unfinished tasks of the Premier and the martyrs, so that we can comfort their spirits in heaven. The President continued: The revolutionary cause of our party has entered a new stage since the victory of the War of Resistance. In this stage, the revolutionary environment is more difficult and the tasks are more arduous. Only by enriching our party, strengthening our organization, and working together with one heart and one mind, can our party comrades overcome all difficulties and complete the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. At present, the most urgent tasks are to suppress the communist bandits who are armed and betraying the country, complete the unification of the country, convene the National Assembly, and implement constitutional government, in order to show the determination of our party to return power to the people. To accomplish this task, our party must have a unified will and concentrated strength. Therefore, the unified organization of the party and league is the only urgent task for improving our party itself. I hope that all comrades will recognize its significance and their own responsibilities, sincerely and thoroughly implement it. After the unification of the party and league, advanced comrades must uphold the spirit of mutual love and sincerity to support the younger generation, and the younger generation must cherish the glorious history of our party, recognize the great mission of the revolution, obey the orders of the party, abide by the party's discipline, unite as one, and work together to strengthen the revolutionary forces of our party, realize the Three Principles of the People, and complete the urgent tasks of this conference.</p>
<h3>President Zhang Reports on Politics and Diplomacy at the Plenary Session</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] At the first session of the Fourth Plenary Session in the afternoon of the 9th, President Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan reported on politics and diplomacy for one hour and ten minutes. Zhang first explained the position of the Executive Yuan after the reorganization of the government, stating that: At the current stage, the National Government Committee has replaced the Supreme National Defense Council as the highest decision-making body of the country, and the Executive Yuan is responsible for implementing the decisions of the National Government Committee. Zhang expressed his admiration for the sincerity and shared responsibility of the parties participating in the government in overcoming the current difficulties. He then reported on the domestic situation, pointing out the government's painstaking efforts to maintain peace and unity, and emphasized the significance of general mobilization, which is to "suppress the rebellion to seek unity and work hard to seek revitalization," concentrate the will and strength of the whole country, not only to suppress the rebellion passively, but also to actively build.</p>
<p>Finance and Economy</p>
<p>When discussing the financial and economic situation, Zhang pointed out that the national budget situation this year is such that due to military tensions and economic depression, expenditures are huge. Although the government has made every effort to economize, necessary expenditures cannot be forcibly reduced. The government's strategy is to economize on expenditures on the one hand and increase revenues as much as possible on the other. The main method is to rectify tax collection, followed by issuing public bonds to make up for the deficit. Although it is difficult to expect the budget to be completely balanced, we can only strive to reduce the gap. As for currency reform, the conditions are not yet ripe.</p>
<p>Turning to the international balance of payments, in the two years after the war, the international balance of payments was in deficit. After the implementation of the emergency economic measures, it was able to maintain a balance in the initial stage, but then it turned into a deficit again. After the revision of the import and export trade and foreign exchange management methods in August, the balance of payments has been in surplus for the past three weeks. During this period, in addition to the special import of materials that are still settled by the Central Bank, the rest are settled by designated banks at market prices, and the amount is not large, and it is offset by foreign exchange from exports and remittances from overseas Chinese, which is expected to remain in surplus. Zhang pointed out that the current financial and economic difficulties can only be overcome by utilizing the abundant manpower and developing the vast land and resources to seek self-reliance. The emergency economic measures have been revised due to changes in the situation and should continue to be implemented in earnest, but this is a palliative measure, and the economic reform plan for addressing the root causes must be actively implemented, and the National Economic Commission is drafting implementation measures and handling them one after another.</p>
<p>Here, Zhang listed three principles of China's financial and economic policy today: (1) In order to balance the budget, it is necessary to save expenditures and increase revenues. (2) In order to balance the international balance of payments, it is necessary to restrain imports and encourage exports. (3) In order to balance the supply and demand of materials, it is necessary to conserve consumption and increase production. Zhang also emphasized that China can only achieve self-reliance by working hard, saving expenditures, avoiding enjoyment, and making every effort to increase production. China's industrial base is weak, but there is still much to be developed in agriculture and mining, and the Chinese people should do their best. The government's recently promulgated outline of measures for strict economy, the revised methods for managing imports and exports and foreign exchange, and the principles for tightening lending adopted by the Quadruple Joint Treasury, are all determined based on this need.</p>
<p>Political Reform</p>
<p>Turning to the issue of political reform, Zhang believes that the corruption and dereliction of duty, illegality and corruption of some unscrupulous elements in the government have become a trend, and the reasons for this bad political atmosphere are diverse and constitute a serious social problem. The government's position is to always carefully examine personnel selection, strengthen the prevention of malpractices, strictly conduct audits, and encourage reporting. Once corruption is discovered, it will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished, and the superiors in charge will be held jointly responsible, in order to thoroughly reform the political atmosphere. As for the issue of compensation, it is also one of the factors affecting the political atmosphere. This adjustment of compensation is only to seek the fairness of compensation for civil and military officials and personnel of state-owned enterprises and institutions. How to achieve a reasonable standard still needs to be planned.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of administrative efficiency, Zhang believes that in order to improve administrative efficiency, it is necessary to clearly define the responsibilities, improve the organization and equipment, simplify and rationalize the procedures, eliminate redundant agencies, and eliminate contradictory laws and regulations. In recent years, the central government has continuously studied and discussed improvements, and the reorganized Executive Yuan has paid special attention to this issue. Zhang said: The above-mentioned conditions have been very different for central agencies, and the situation at the provincial and county levels is even more unreasonable. Regarding the issue of adjusting laws and regulations at the provincial level, the Executive Yuan has decided to organize an Administrative Laws and Regulations Review Committee to be responsible for it. In terms of institutions, last month, taking advantage of the opportunity of the chairmen of the provinces coming to Beijing to participate in the food conference, four administrative symposiums were convened to listen to opinions. At the same time, at the invitation of the chairman, a comprehensive discussion was held on various issues at the provincial level, and a plan for provincial government reform and simplification was drafted, but it has not yet reached the decision-making stage. As for the issue at the county level, the Executive Yuan has issued a circular to the provinces, requiring the provincial governments to be responsible for implementation. In addition to the financial plan that has been submitted to the State Council and needs to be implemented after the completion of the legislation, the management of institutions, the reduction of concurrent posts by county magistrates, the limitation of the command system, and the selection and assessment of county-level officials have all been given clear instructions.</p>
<p>Diplomacy</p>
<p>Regarding diplomacy, Zhang emphasized that China's basic diplomatic requirement after the war is to strive for world peace so that China can obtain the opportunity for stability and construction. The government must try its best to maintain its own friendly relations with the major Allied countries and support the United Nations to promote cooperation among the major powers.</p>
<p>Regarding diplomacy with the United States, the United States fought alongside us during the war, and it also provided a great deal of help in the surrender of prisoners of war after the war. In the future, there will be many opportunities for mutual cooperation with us in international politics. Zhang said that some of the views of the United States on China are quite correct and can be used as medicine for self-reflection and self-encouragement, but it cannot fully understand the difficulties encountered by China. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance mutual understanding between the two countries in the future to strengthen their cooperative relationship.</p>
<p>As for diplomacy with the Soviet Union, China and the Soviet Union are neighbors, and the relationship must be friendly. In view of this need, we signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship after the war. This treaty is very disadvantageous to China, but at that time, the government wanted to have a common treaty with the Soviet Union as the basis for adjusting the relations between the two countries. Therefore, it reluctantly accepted the Yalta Secret Agreement and relaxed some of its sovereignty in Northeast China. Now China only requires the implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship from the Soviet Union. China absolutely abides by its treaty obligations, and if the Soviet Union does not abide by them, we will definitely argue on the basis of reason.</p>
<p>Regarding the veto issue, China advocates that the charter should not be fundamentally amended to abolish the veto power, but it believes that a reasonable interpretation should be found to limit its abuse.</p>
<p>Speaking of the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, Zhang pointed out that our basic attitude is not to adopt a revengeful attitude, but we will never give up our demands for due compensation from Japan. We are willing to see Japan's peaceful reconstruction, but we must prevent it from becoming a threat to peace in the Far East again.</p>
<p>Regarding the Korean issue, Zhang expressed great concern and explained that what China expects is the emergence of a unified and independent new Korea. China is willing to promote anything that is conducive to this goal, and China will oppose anything that violates this goal.</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang mentioned the issue of the freedom and independence of weak and small nations. The independence and freedom of nations is the basic policy of the Kuomintang. China, in principle, expresses sympathy for the struggle for independence and freedom of the nations in Southeast Asia, but the protection of the lives and property of overseas Chinese is particularly important.

<h3>Today's Agenda</h3>
<p>Joint conferences of the party and league will be held both this morning and this afternoon to discuss the party's new proposed program. A reorganization committee will be convened in the evening.</p>
<h3>Gleanings from the Opening Ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>The National Assembly Hall was filled with an atmosphere of boundless joy and solemnity today. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and the Joint Conference of the Party and League were opened here today. Around eight hundred party and league cadres brought their opinions from various regions to participate in this epoch-making and important conference inside and outside the party.</p>
<p>The capital, which had been overcast for several days, was clear and blue today, and the autumn sky was high and bright. The morning sun shone brilliantly on the party and national flags fluttering in front of the hall, giving people a feeling of excitement and also a sense of respect and reverence.</p>
<p>▽ The layout of the venue was slightly different from the past. It showed the unity and cooperation of the party and the league. Everywhere on the four walls and in the corridors, you could see the interweaving of the party and national flags and the combination of the league emblem and the party emblem. The light yellow walls, matched with red and blue tones, created a harmony. In an extremely soft atmosphere, everyone had a very calm and comfortable mood. Some people used this to wish the conference a successful outcome.</p>
<p>The venue was filled with greetings of reunion after a long separation and inquiries about election preparations. Everyone showed infinite concern.</p>
<p>As the opening ceremony began, the party leader, President Chiang, walked out slowly from behind amidst welcoming music. Today, he was wearing a khaki-colored Zhongshan suit. His silver-white hair roots once made every loyal and patriotic party comrade feel a little worried and also feel infinite sympathy for the hard work of the head of state. However, his radiant face and his bright and firm eyes dispelled all these thoughts.</p>
<p>The sound of President Chiang's instructions was still so clear, almost as young and energetic as ever. He said that unity is strength and that unification brings about new life. His words were enough to remind people of the unity and unification needed in the current difficult environment.</p>
<p>After President Chiang's instructions were completed, a burst of loud applause erupted in the venue, expressing excitement and reverence. President Chiang withdrew with a kind expression of thanks.</p>
<p>▽ Madame Song Meiling did not appear on the stage or in the front row today in her capacity as Madame Chiang. She simply sat in the middle seat in the back row of the Central Committee. She appeared in the venue earlier than the President, wearing a long gown with a black background and white flowers, plus a black short coat, showing a quiet and inconspicuous identity.</p>
<p>After the opening ceremony, there was a 20-minute break, followed by a preparatory meeting, which was still presided over by President Chiang. When the election of the presidium began, Ma Chaojun immediately proposed to ask the President to designate candidates, which was unanimously approved. This precious trust was fully demonstrated here.</p>
<p>Sitting next to Madame Chiang were Ms. Qian Yong and Ms. Zhang Weizhen, two female senators, who looked very close. The Madame always showed a very amiable smile. She did not attend in the afternoon. Everyone said, "Probably because she is already very familiar with the government's major plans."</p>
<p>The lounge was still upstairs, but unlike the National Assembly, there was tea but no snacks. Although soda and Coca-Cola were available, they had to be paid for.</p>
<p>The time management of the conference has been done in accordance with the conditions of observing economy and consumption. Not to mention the morning, the afternoon conference was originally scheduled to end from 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM, but it started at 3:05 PM and ended at 6:35 PM.</p>
<p>The political and military reports were both concise and simple, so three reports in one afternoon did not give people a feeling of fatigue bombing. Each report lasted about an hour.</p>
<p>▽ When Bai Chongxi reported on military affairs, there were written documents in the policy section, but Bai still read them page by page, and made corrections where there were errors, so the audience was busy proofreading.</p>
<p>There were no traces of journalists in the venue, and the public was not allowed to attend, but there were many newspapers distributed inside the venue.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Reports on the Unified Organization of the Party and League at the Plenary Session</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Committee Member Wu Tiecheng gave a report on the unified organization of the Party and League at the first session of the Fourth Plenary Session on the afternoon of the 9th. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>I am honored to be ordered to report on the progress of the important event of the unified organization of the Party and League as one of the conveners of the Committee for the Unified Organization of the Party and League, and to briefly describe the main points of the leader's instructions and the opinions of the comrades. Previously, when the Provisional National Congress of our party was convened in Wuhan in March of the 27th year of the Republic of China, in order to strengthen the leadership of the military and civilians in engaging in the War of Resistance, in addition to establishing the party's leader after the death of the Premier, the Three Principles of the People Youth League was also organized, relying on its establishment to exert great strength during the war and finally achieve final victory. Now, the Communist Party's tricks of harming the country and the nation and dividing the revolutionary forces are more sinister than before. Party and league comrades have all realized that the first major event at present is to enhance the spirit of one heart and one mind and strengthen the actions of concerted efforts to respond to the division of the Chinese Communist Party and eliminate the rebellion of the Chinese Communist Party. In March of this year, when our party held the Third Plenary Session, party and league cadres had already proposed the unification of the leadership of the party and league. After repeated meetings and detailed research by the responsible comrades of the Central Committee of the Party and League and the instructions of the President and concurrently the Head of the League, the Committee for the Unified Organization of the Party and League and the Guidance Committee for the Unified Organization of the Party and League were established. From this, a draft of the new construction program of our party was drafted. One part of the draft is the draft organizational program of our party at present, and one part is the draft political program of our party at present. In addition to making this case an issue and sending it to the comrades of the party and league departments in various provinces and cities for research, the recent Second Plenary Session of the Central League Headquarters has also conducted detailed research, and its opinions will be sent to the Party and League Federation.</p>
<h3>The Second Plenary Session of the Youth League Discusses the Draft Program for the Transformation of the Party and Approves It in Principle with Further Textual Amendments</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The Second Plenary Session of the Youth League continued to hold its fourth session at 9:00 AM on the 8th, chaired by Chen Xueping, to discuss the "Draft Program for the Transformation of the Party." This draft program has become more substantial and complete after being comprehensively researched and supplemented by the eighteen-member group. The current political program section has been reorganized and expanded into eight items, the main points of which are: (1) Ensure national unity and territorial integrity. (2) Realize political democracy and complete constitutional government on schedule. (3) Thoroughly reform politics and severely punish corruption. (4) Guarantee the economic interests of workers and peasants and rationally improve the treatment of officers, soldiers, and public educators. (5) Guarantee equal opportunities for young people to study and find employment. (6) Promote the spirit of self-reliance and stimulate the enthusiasm of the people across the country to build the nation. (7) Uphold collective security, respect international equality, and maintain world peace. The current organizational program section has been expanded and revised into: (1) Principles, (2) Party Members, (3) Organizations at All Levels, (4) Cadres, (5) Discipline. The chairman read each item aloud, conducted detailed research, and especially discussed the part on organizations at all levels for the longest time. As a result, it was approved in principle, and another five-member group composed of Huang Shao Valley, Chen Jiesheng, Li Junlong, Tu Gongcui, and Chen Xueping was formed to refer to the various revised opinions and make textual amendments. The meeting adjourned at 12:10 PM.</p>
<h3>Zeng Qi Elected Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Youth Party, Zuo Shunsheng and Others Elected Standing Committee Members</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] The Eleventh Central Executive Committee and Central Supervisory Committee of the China Youth Party held their first session at Lidu Flower Garden at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, respectively, to elect the chairman and standing committee members. As a result of the vote, Zeng Qi was elected chairman of the Central Executive Committee. Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, Yu Fuxian, He Luzhi, Zheng Zhenwen, Liu Dongyan, Xia Taosheng, Wang Shizeng, Lin Keji, Yang Yongjun, Yu Xiaoquan (female), Zhang Zizhu, Liu Jingyuan, Wang Lanzeng, Duan Shenxiu, and Liu Siying were elected as standing committee members of the Central Executive Committee. Li Buwei and Zhang Mengjiu were elected as chairman and vice-chairman of the Central Supervisory Committee.</p>
<p>The conference reference, once approved by the Fourth Plenary Session, will be the highest standard for the future movement of all comrades. This conference is a revolutionary, constructive, and political conference, a conference to concentrate revolutionary forces and consolidate revolutionary organizations. It is believed that the strength of the unified organization of the party and league realized by this meeting will surely be able to quell the rebellion, unify the country, and improve the national economy and the people's livelihood, just as the reorganization of the Revive China Society into the Tongmenghui two years before the Republic of China was able to overthrow the Qing Dynasty, the reorganization of the Kuomintang into the Chinese Revolutionary Party in the third year of the Republic of China was able to overthrow Yuan Shikai's imperial system, the reorganization of the Chinese Kuomintang in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China was able to pacify the warlords, and the implementation of the new construction of our party in the twenty-seventh year of the Republic of China was able to win the victory of the War of Resistance. Therefore, the comrades of the party and league have firm confidence in the unification of this revolutionary organization and the solidarity of the revolutionary forces.</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Arrives in San Francisco, Washington Rumors Say That We Have Notified the US Government of Our Determination to Rely on Our Own Efforts to Suppress the Communists and Build the Nation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 8th] Wang Shijie, the chief representative of our delegation to the Second General Assembly of the United Nations, and his entourage arrived here tonight. Wang plans to stay in San Francisco for two days before departing for New York, the world capital.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 8th] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie said: "There is no hope for peace in China unless the CCP army is destroyed." However, Wang did not express his opinion on how or when this could be accomplished. Asked if there was still hope for the resumption of peace talks in the country, Wang solemnly replied: "No."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Reliable sources here revealed tonight that the Chinese government has notified the United States that it wants to eliminate the "communist threat" and intends to proceed with the reconstruction of post-war China, whether or not it receives US aid.</p>
<h3>Those Who Criticize the Chinese Government Have Never Been to Communist Areas</h3>
<p>Comment by Howard Newspaper Group</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 8th, Associated Press] An editorial in the Howard Newspaper Group recently quoted a dispatch from Northern China by the newspaper's reporter, Newton, saying that the accusations against the Chinese National Government that the CCP restricts the freedom of the people, oppresses the working masses, and that officials are corrupt and incompetent, most of the authors of these arguments have never been to the CCP's liberated areas, but are deeply poisoned by the CCP's propaganda, thinking that the situation in the liberated areas under the rule of the land revolution party is naturally better. Therefore, the newspaper specifically pointed out Newton's observations, saying that when the Communist Party occupies a place, the people flee one after another. Whenever the National Army recovers a place, the people happily return to their homes.</p>

<h3>US-China Agreement Reached on Handling and Distributing Relief Supplies; Details Under Negotiation with Progress</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] Regarding American foreign relief after the end of UNRRA, the US Congress passed a bill for $350 million in May, which includes China. It is now learned from official sources that the United States and China have reached an agreement on the general principles for the handling and distribution of relief supplies. A State Department official told reporters today that the details of the relief agreement are being negotiated by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the US Embassy. The State Department has not received reports recently, but it is expected that the negotiations will have made progress. It is also reported that Ambassador Gu Weijun has consulted with State Department officials several times regarding US aid to China after the end of UNRRA. The bill passed by the previous Congress stipulates that $350 million in basic relief supplies will be delivered to Austria, Italy, Hungary, the Netherlands, Greece, the Trieste area, and China. The United States has already reached agreements with Italy, Greece, and Austria, and US relief delegations have been sent to various countries to supervise the distribution of relief supplies. Relief supplies will not be sent to Poland and Hungary because the food situation there has "improved". The general principles of the agreement between the United States and China should be the same as the agreements with other countries. This stipulates that the country receiving relief should submit a plan for relief and import needs to the United States in advance. This plan must be reviewed and approved by the United States. The distribution of relief supplies should be directly supervised and controlled by US representatives under the terms of the agreement. The US allows the distribution of supplies through commercial channels, but the extent should be practical and in good condition. The United States will send relief delegations to the countries receiving relief. The delegation is affiliated with the US Embassy in each country, and its mission is to supervise and inspect the reports of each country, and to travel to various places to see how the terms of the agreement are implemented. The country receiving relief will appoint a senior official to contact the US representative and take the necessary economic measures to reduce its need for relief supplies. Relief supplies, as well as similar materials produced in the country or imported from foreign countries, should be distributed to all levels without distinction of race, religion, or political belief. The country receiving relief also decides to maintain the rationing and price control system to ensure the fair distribution of supplies. In some cases, relief supplies can be sold, and the proceeds are deposited in a bank in the country receiving relief, but withdrawals cannot be made without the consent of the United States. The agreement also stipulates that the country receiving relief should maintain complete statistics on relief supplies, and newspapers and broadcasts are allowed to report on the distribution and use of relief supplies. The relief plan should be fully publicized to the outside world in advance.</p>
<h3>National Army in Jiaodong Captures Gu Xian; Yantai, Longkou, and Other Places Have Become Dead Ports; Recovery Work in Southern Shandong Fully Underway</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 9th] The National Army in Pingdu engaged in fierce battles with bandits in the Dazeshan area north of Zhengda. By dusk yesterday, they had captured all the key points of the mountain passes. The remaining bandits fled into the deep mountains and are being pursued. The eastward advancing National Army captured Gu Xian this morning. The northward advancing National Army began to advance north yesterday and is currently fighting fiercely with bandits in Lingshan. Bandits are stubbornly resisting from the top of Lingshan. Large formations of the air force have been heavily bombing for days. Yantai, Weihai, Longkou and other places have become dead ports.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 9th] The National Army that recovered Pingdu in the Shandong Peninsula continued to advance north along the Ping (du) Ye (xian) highway. At 4:00 PM on the 8th, they continued to capture Li Pu. The remaining bandits were defeated and fled north. At this point, the bandit's Ninth Column, the Yellow River Detachment, the New Fifth Division, the New Sixth Division, the Police Fifth Brigade, and other 20,000 to 30,000 men have been driven by the National Army to the eastern mountainous area of ​​the peninsula, facing the sea on three sides, with no way to escape, and are like fish in a net.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 9th] The National Army in Jiaodong has been advancing smoothly for days and has entered a state of complete victory. Judging from the situation, the eastern Shandong area can be completely recovered within a month. The defensive works in Jinan have already been mostly completed. Wang Yaowu issued an order to temporarily suspend them for a few days due to the current busy farming season, and will continue the work after the autumn harvest is over.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 9th] According to an air force reconnaissance report, the Northern Army attacking Zhucheng had reached the suburbs of the city on the 9th, and the recovery of Zhucheng is imminent.</p>
<p>[United Press, Peiping, 9th] The Mayor of Beiping, He Siyuan, told a United Press reporter today that the ports controlled by the Communist bandits in Yantai and other parts of the Shandong Peninsula are expected to be recovered within two or three weeks. At that time, the military situation in Shandong will be virtually over, and the actions of hundreds of thousands of National Army troops in Hebei and the Northeast will be free from any risk of being hampered. He also estimated that the number of Shandong Communist bandits, originally 500,000, has now been reduced to around 100,000 due to deaths, injuries, desertions, and retreats. Liu Bocheng initially led 60,000 troops to invade the southwest, but now he has broken through and fled to Hubei, with no more than 15,000 remaining. Those who stay in the province have mostly abandoned their weapons and armor, planning to resume their old occupations.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 9th] The recovery work in Southern Shandong is fully underway. Yu Jimin, Director of the Shandong Provincial Government's Eastern Shandong Administrative Office, and the Mayor of Weihaiwei Long, flew from Jinan to Qingdao together on the 8th to preside over the recovery. In addition, a group of more than 300 members of the Yantai Municipal Government's Armed Return-to-Homeland Corps has also set off with the front-line troops of the National Army, preparing to enter Yantai together to start the recovery work. After the Jiaoji Railway's Jinan-Zhangdian section and the Zhangbo branch line were approved by the Ministry of Communications for emergency repairs, the Jinpu Railway Administration has sent personnel to Zhangdian to set up an office to preside over the emergency repairs and railway restoration work. In addition, the Jinpu Railway's Xuzhou-Jinan section had previously been rushed to Dawenkou, but later the Wen River bridge was washed away by the autumn rains. In order to strengthen the restoration project, the Railway Administration decided to rebuild the bridge and will continue to rush north from Wenkou starting on the 10th. Ge Tan, Director of the Sixth District Bureau of the Ministry of Communications' Highway Administration, arrived in Jinan by plane from Peiping on the afternoon of the 8th to inspect the national highway lines in Shandong Province and make plans for the restoration project.</p>
<h3>Beiping Officially Bans Dancing</h3>
<p>Commercial Dance Halls Completely Closed</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] In order to implement the central government's mobilization and frugality measures, the Beiping City authorities today announced the closure of commercial dance halls. The Beijing Hotel, the Six Nations Hotel, the Meicun Dance, and the McGhee Officers' Club have all ceased operations. The police station explained that non-scheduled, non-commercial dance parties are not within the scope of the ban.</p>
<h3>Situation on Ping-Bao Section Stabilizes; Gaobeidian Relieved</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] The situation on the Ping-Bao section stabilized last night. Laishui is still under attack by a Communist army regiment, which approached the city last night. The railway was not damaged last night. The regiment in Gaobeidian has been relieved. Today, the Ping-Southbound train will pass through Dingxing. Communication is cut off between Beihe and Caohe, and the situation is unknown. Repair is very difficult.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th] The Tianjin Command of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters has received an order to withdraw and has begun to handle the closing work.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Block the Songhua River</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8th] The Communist bandits have once again blocked the necessary route for merchants traveling north and south on the Songhua River, and the blockade is even tighter than the previous ones. This is the "usual practice" of the Communist bandits to prevent the people under their control from fleeing to the government area before each offensive against the Songnan area.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 9th] The restless Northeast Communist bandits, in the Jichang area, have been contained daily by the results of the National Army's attacks. Judging from their actions, they are mostly exploratory in nature, so large-scale battles, apart from southern Liaoning, are likely to be temporarily stable in the Jichang area.</p>
<h3>Anhui Communist Bandits Eyeing Tongcheng; A Major Battle Will Unfold in Liu'an</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 9th] After the Communist bandits captured Shucheng, they looted extensively. On the 8th, more than 1,000 bandits advanced towards the west bank of Chaohu and reached Sanhe. Another group advanced on Tongcheng and was intercepted by National Army teams in the Tongcheng Jiantian Mountains. The front line in Liu'an was quiet yesterday and today, with both sides busy reinforcing, and a major battle is about to unfold. Liu Bocheng is still in Shangcheng commanding. Liu's troops' escape to Shucheng seems to be to contain the National Army's forces. A force has joined forces with the local Eighth Route Army between Huoshan and Tongcheng. Ying Mountain in eastern Hubei has fallen, and the local Eighth Route Army between Huangmei and Taihu is also very active.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 9th] The National Army attacking Liu'an from the north has reached the suburbs of the city. A group of four to five hundred bandit soldiers who had fled into Shucheng encountered the National Army at Taoxi Town, thirty miles north of the city, on the night of the 8th and engaged in a fierce battle. The bandit army immediately collapsed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hefei, 9th] A group of two to three hundred bandits who had fled into Shucheng harassed Taoxi Town on the Shu-He Highway on the night of the 8th, and were repelled by the National Army after fighting for about two hours.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 9th] Military news: (1) The bandits who were scattered from Macheng are fleeing in the direction of Luotian, and our army is intercepting them. (2) The bandit independent regiments 1 and 4, which had fled north from Yangdian towards Tiepu, joined forces with the bandits in Dawu Mountain on the 8th, and then fled in the direction of Lüwangcheng.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 9th] On the 8th, a powerful air force formation cooperated with the army in the areas of Luotian, Macheng, Yingshan, and Liu'an to encircle and annihilate the bandit army, killing hundreds of bandits.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 9th] Liu Bocheng's Communist bandits fled from southwestern Henan this time for three weeks. Their remaining force of 23,000 has suffered about 5,000 casualties due to interceptions by the National Army everywhere (the bandits never formally resisted the National Army). However, the number of strong men and civilians who were coerced and drafted by the bandits along the way must have been considerable, and the number of those who fled is enough to offset it. The current force is actually only about 20,000 people.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th] The battle for Huaiyang is being waged fiercely. On the morning of the 9th, a melee broke out at the four passes, and the bandits suffered heavier casualties.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 9th] After Song County was lost, County Magistrate Miao Weifan's whereabouts are unknown. The bandit army that captured the city continued to invade Lushi to the west. Guxian Town, sixty miles east of Lushi, was besieged by more than 3,000 bandits. Bandit units were also discovered more than ten miles outside the east and northeast of the city, and are engaged in fierce battles with local forces.</p>
<h3>Gui Yongqing Inspects River Defenses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiujiang, 9th] Gui Yongqing rushed to the Shili Pu airfield from Nanjing on the 8th to pay his respects to the Chairman. On the 9th, he went to Hukou and Wuxue to inspect the river defenses. On the 10th, he will go to Hankou from Wuxue.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Revival of Industry and Mining in the Northeast; Northeast Electric Power Bureau of the Resources Committee Launches General Mobilization of Electric Power Production</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 9th] The Resources Committee's Northeast Electric Power Bureau launched a "General Mobilization of Electric Power Production," which is the first step towards the revival of industry and mining. Three principles have now been decided: (1) All the power plants belonging to the Resources Committee in Fushun, Benxi, Jinxi, Fuxin, Anshan, and Hezuo will be repaired and put into operation by the end of September, with a total power generation capacity of 65,000 kilowatts; (2) All power generation equipment of various highway production enterprises will be repaired and utilized as much as possible, which can obtain 4,000 kilowatts of power. The Electric Power Bureau will subsidize those that are insufficient; (3) The Chang-Shen transmission line will be repaired by the end of September, which can transmit 40,000 kilowatts from Xiaofeng Man. It is expected that 100,000 kilowatts of thermal power and 40,000 kilowatts of hydropower can be generated by the end of November, a total of 140,000 kilowatts. The power problems in southern and western Liaoning can be solved. Guo Didi, Director of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau, told reporters: The problem of industrial and mining production can be said to be that it is alive with electricity and dead without electricity. 70% of the electricity in the Northeast relies on Xiaofeng Man. It is hoped that the National Army will quickly drive out the Communist bandits in the Meihekou area and open up the Ji-Shen transmission line.</p>

<h3>Foreign Ministry Officially Announces China and Burma to Exchange Ambassadors; Negotiations Continuing on the Return of Overseas Chinese to Burma</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that the Chinese government has formally agreed to exchange ambassadors with the Burmese government. China and Burma have always had close relations. After the exchange of ambassadors, the relations between the two countries will be strengthened, and Burma's position in East Asia will become more important.</p>

The government is currently continuing negotiations to send other exiled overseas Chinese back to Burma in a very short period of time. The Burmese authorities once opposed the return of overseas Chinese to Burma, saying that it would increase the government's financial burden, but the Chinese government believes that all overseas Chinese in Burma are rich and will definitely contribute to Burma's post-war reconstruction once their businesses are restored. Finally, the two governments agreed that overseas Chinese who were born in Burma or lived in Burma before 1942, and those who can support themselves, are allowed to return to Burma. At least 2,000 overseas Chinese are allowed to return to Burma each month.</p>

<h3>Spokesman of the Ministry of Communications Discusses Air Rights Issues; Maritime Law Under Consideration for Amendment</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The spokesman of the Ministry of Communications recently issued the following statement on the current air rights issues: (1) If the directors and total capital of a shipping company jointly operated by foreign and Chinese nationals meet the requirements of Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the Maritime Law, with more than two-thirds being Chinese or Chinese-owned, and have been formally submitted to the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Economy for approval and registration, and have obtained Chinese legal person status, its ships should be regarded as Chinese-owned and allowed to operate. (2) The Maritime Law stipulates restrictions on foreign capital, and this will continue to be handled as before, but because inland navigation is related to China's sovereignty, amendments to the Maritime Law are being considered. (3) According to the regulations of the Ministry of Communications on the supervision of the shipping industry and the regulations on the registration of the shipping industry, anyone engaged in the shipping business must not start operations without being approved and registered by the Ministry of Communications and issued a license.

<h3>Military and Official Discipline Inspection Corps of Peiping, Tientsin, and Hebei Uncovers Another Case of Malfeasance; Hebei Central Electricity Company Unauthorizedly Establishes an Agency</h3>
<p>[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Beiping, dated the 9th] The Military and Official Discipline Inspection Corps of Peiping, Tientsin, and Hebei has uncovered another case of malfeasance. Tu Jingsheng, a standing committee member of the Supply Committee privately established by the Hebei Central Electricity Company, has now been turned over to the court. Bao Guobao, the general manager of the company, is suspected and is still under investigation. After Bao replaced the manager, he unauthorizedly established a Supply Committee specifically for purchasing materials, without the approval of the National Resources Commission. This agency was not abolished, and Bao appointed himself as the chairman, with Tu as a standing committee member, responsible for managing affairs on Bao's behalf. Now, after investigation by the supervisory team, it has been found that Tu engaged in numerous acts of malfeasance when purchasing materials, involving a large sum of money, which is still difficult to estimate. It has been verified that he embezzled profits from purchasing gasoline, asbestos powder, hardware, etc. The methods included purchasing expensive goods in Tianjin instead of cheaper goods in Beiping and having someone named Wang forge stamps for reimbursement. Sixty-four pieces of evidence have been found. Yu Hezhi, the purchasing team leader under Tu, is a relative of Yu Changju, the manager of the Beiping branch of the company, and is also heavily suspected. It is reported that due to frequent breakdowns of the company's generators in Peiping, resulting in constant power outages, citizens have repeatedly filed complaints with the authorities and the Provisional Consultative Council, and Bao and Yu have been censured by the Supervisory Department for their dereliction of duty. The Inspection Corps also uncovered another case, namely, the major embezzlement case of Qi Wenping, a former Major General Commander of the Jinjing Border Region of the Hebei Advance Army (now the Military Law Office of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters), which was adjudicated by the Military Law Supervisory Department of the former Eleventh War Zone last year. The Inspection Corps believes that the sentence was too lenient and that the embezzled funds were not fully recovered. The offender, shortly after the Japanese surrender, used his position as commander to receive 11 tons of silver and 1 kilogram of cultured pearls from the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin. After being reported, he was sent to the Military Law Department and sentenced to nine years in prison, but only 7 kilograms of cultured pearls and a small amount of silver were recovered from the embezzled funds. The corps believes that the Military Law Supervisory Department is suspected of dereliction of duty and perverting the law and has decided to order the competent authorities to bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Accepting Criticism and Striving for Improvement</h3>
<p>——After Reading Chairman Chiang’s Speech</p>
<p>The Sixth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party solemnly opened in the capital yesterday morning. Chairman Chiang personally presided over the meeting and delivered a speech on the spot, pointing out that it has been two years since the victory of the War of Resistance, and the revolution has reached its final juncture. Success or failure hinges on this moment. The dangers and difficulties of the revolutionary cause are greater than at any time in the past. Therefore, the main task of this plenary session is to seek the merger and unity of the party. Going forward, there are two points we should pay attention to: (1) Recently, China's politics, economy, and military have been criticized by foreigners. We should not resent this but should humbly accept well-intentioned criticism and strive to improve our politics, economy, and military; (2) In the future, if we want to eliminate the Communist bandits and stabilize China, we must reform the party's internal structure and strive for improvement in all aspects of politics, economy, and military. Although Chairman Chiang's speech was not specifically directed at the statement made by President Truman's special envoy, General Wedemeyer, Chairman Chiang's magnanimous spirit, in not only being able to humbly accept criticism from others but also using this to encourage all members of the Nationalist Party, truly makes him worthy of being called a first-rate statesman of our time. After repeatedly reading Chairman Chiang's speech, I firmly believe that whether one is a member of the Nationalist Party or not, anyone who is a part of the Republic of China should accept Chairman Chiang's instructions and teachings.</p>
<p>Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper expressed the hope that the Nationalist Party could lead the Chinese people on the path of "self-reliance" to complete the task of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. This was not inspired by Wedemeyer's statement but was the result of our internal examination of the domestic situation and external consideration of the world situation. We believe that China has only one way out, and that is "self-reliance." As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." As long as we can truly embark on the path of "self-reliance," we will not have to worry about international assistance. The reason is very simple and well-known to the Chinese people. Taking the victory of the War of Resistance as an example, if we had not used our own flesh and blood to fight against the enemy's artillery fire after the July 7th Incident and fought alone, the international situation would never have become completely favorable to our country. The fact that China won the War of Resistance is enough to prove that China can only take the path of self-reliance. There is no other way to survive. This is the unanimous understanding of the current state of affairs by the Chinese government and the public. We knew long before Wedemeyer's statement that we should take this great road of "self-reliance." It is said that before Wedemeyer made his statement, the Chinese government had already sent a memorandum to Wedemeyer, but this memorandum has not been officially announced. According to a report by the United Press, in this unreleased memorandum, the Chinese government solemnly declared that China had resisted alone for four years, so China believes that it has the ability to overcome current difficulties. At the same time, it pointed out the four steps of "self-reliance": (1) Communist armed forces must be suppressed; any compromise should not be considered. … The outcome of this struggle is related to the peace and security of the entire Far East. (2) Effective steps must be taken immediately to control inflation, without further delay. (3) Within the limits of government resources, the work of economic recovery should be intensified. (4) Political reforms have been implemented, basic democratic institutions and practices have been established, and efforts will continue in the future. If the United Press report is a true reflection of the facts, then it is clear that the Chinese government was already prepared to implement self-reliance.</p>
<p>Wedemeyer's statement can be observed from two angles, and there are two different views in domestic public opinion: one is that Wedemeyer's statement is the earnest advice of a friend, and we should humbly accept his criticism, adopt the attitude of "correcting mistakes if we have them, and making improvements if we don't," and engage in deep self-reflection, striving for political, economic, and military reforms; the other is that Wedemeyer's statement is nothing short of a great insult to the Chinese people, and everyone should consider it a great disgrace. As the saying goes, "Knowing shame is close to courage," and we should carve out a bloody path for the country and the nation in shame. What is the government's attitude? Since no formal announcement has been made, we have no way of knowing. But today, after reading Chairman Chiang's speech, we can understand Chairman Chiang's views. Chairman Chiang's magnanimity and broad mind, which can accommodate criticism from outsiders, are truly admirable. In fact, so-called democratic politics is a kind of politics that can withstand criticism from others. Without the criticism and attacks from the opposition, politics will not progress. We have long seen this subtle effect from the practical application of democratic politics in Britain and the United States. Going forward, the Nationalist Party should not only humbly accept criticism from others but also constantly reflect on itself. As the saying goes, "Examine oneself three times a day." Only in this way can we "strengthen ourselves unceasingly" and "improve ourselves day by day." Since Chairman Chiang has admitted that the present moment is the final juncture for the success or failure of the revolution, we naturally do not need to shy away from the fact that the internal organization of the Nationalist Party urgently needs to be reformed. For more than 20 years of the Nationalist Party's rule, the Communist Party has always been the Nationalist Party's only enemy, but its power has not only not weakened but has grown day by day. While other factors are undoubtedly numerous, the unsoundness of the Nationalist Party's internal structure cannot be denied as one of the important factors. Now that we are in the period of suppressing the rebellion, in addition to suppressing it with military force, the Nationalist Party must also reform itself, so that it can cooperate with the military. Only by taking this dual approach can we achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>

<h3>British Cabinet Discusses New Policies to Address Current Major Economic Crisis; Plans to Borrow from International Monetary Fund to Overcome Difficulties; Balancing Exports and Imports is the Biggest Challenge</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, dispatch dated the 9th: The British Cabinet held a meeting today, with Prime Minister Attlee returning from vacation to personally attend and preside over the discussion of methods to revive the American economy in order to cope with the current economic crisis. In the coming week, the British government will continue to hold meetings of a political, economic, and financial nature, and the atmosphere is tense. The British side is eager to eliminate the difference between imports and exports. Therefore, the International Monetary Fund meeting to be held in London this Thursday will have a major impact on the British economic situation, as the world economy is interconnected. The British side may request that the International Monetary Fund provide the UK with a certain amount of US dollars, pending the implementation of the Marshall Plan. This transitional measure will be sufficient to help the UK overcome its current difficulties. The most noteworthy event this week is that Minister of Commerce Cripps will announce on Friday a plan to increase production and exports to gradually close the gap between exports and imports. Britain may again tighten the import of food and other commodities. Britain's economic war is about to gradually approach its climax.</p>
<p>[United Press] London, dispatch dated the 8th: US Treasury Secretary Snyder arrived here today and will hold important talks with the British government, but the chance of success in providing further dollar aid to Britain remains uncertain. When Snyder arrived at Southampton on the Queen Elizabeth, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton traveled by car from London to the dock to greet him. He also greeted Canadian Finance Minister Abbott, who arrived on the same ship. Snyder arrived in the UK as the US director of the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund Board of Directors to attend the second annual meeting, but he will also take this opportunity to discuss Britain's financial situation with British Prime Minister Attlee, Chancellor Dalton, and other senior British officials. As it stands, there are three ways Britain can obtain dollar aid before the Marshall Plan is implemented: (1) Unfreeze the final batch of US loans that were frozen during continued negotiations, totaling US$400 million; (2) Negotiate a loan from the US Export-Import Bank; (3) Borrow from the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank. Accompanying Snyder to the UK are more than 100 financial experts from various countries attending the International Monetary Fund meeting.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Notes on the Anglo-French Treaty; Valid for Fifty Years; Has Two Major Goals: Defense and Construction</h3>
<p>[Reuters] London, dispatch dated the 8th: The Anglo-French Treaty of Alliance, signed in Dunkirk this March, was formally ratified here on the 8th. A simple ceremony was held inside the British Foreign Office. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Ambassador Massigli exchanged speeches, expressing that Britain and France are determined to stand on the same front, not only to deal with any future military aggression, but also to cooperate in taking constructive economic action to maintain Western civilization. The treaty is valid for 50 years and stipulates that if Germany engages in re-aggression, Britain and France will provide mutual assistance. It also stipulates that the two countries should regularly exchange views on matters affecting their economic relations. Bevin pointed out that the treaty has two goals, preventive and constructive, which is tantamount to telling Germany that if militarism or aggressive attempts occur again, Britain and France will deal with them together. Massigli replied that the treaty has already stipulated that Britain and France have common aspirations and common goals, and he believes that this treaty will be the beginning of an era of closer cooperation.</p>
<h3>Bevin Scheduled to Visit France</h3>
<p>To Discuss the European Economic Report</p>
<p>[Central News Agency] London, dispatch dated the 8th: British Foreign Secretary Bevin, in his capacity as chairman of the meeting, has invited the foreign ministers of twelve European countries to attend the Paris economic conference to study the Marshall Plan. It is reported that Foreign Secretary Bevin may go to Paris on the 16th to attend the final plenary meeting, at which time various reports can be submitted for study.</p>
<p>[Associated Press] Paris, dispatch dated the 9th: The Economic Cooperation Committee, which is in charge of promoting the Marshall Plan for European recovery, began reviewing the Food and Agriculture Subcommittee's report today. The report stated that the sixteen European countries unanimously agreed that they would need US$21.9 billion in US loans over the next four years to purchase food or food production equipment.</p>
<h3>Britain Will Agree to US Request to Reduce Imperial Preference</h3>
<p>[United Press] Geneva, dispatch dated the 8th: Well-informed British sources told this reporter that Britain will agree to the US request today to significantly reduce imperial preference for goods from various regions and remove some preferential regulations. The current preferential tax rates on approximately 200 kinds of goods will be reduced by 5% to 25%. Britain will deliver this response to the United States this week.</p>
<h3>European Federal Parliament Holds Its First Meeting</h3>
<p>[Associated Press] Gstaad, Switzerland, dispatch dated the 8th: The "European Federal Parliament" held its first meeting today. Chairman Professor Coudenhove-Kalergi of Austria said in his speech that the Paris economic cooperation conference initiated by Marshall will definitely fail. The obstacles are the same as those when French Foreign Minister Briand convened a meeting of European foreign ministers in 1929 to discuss the organization of a European federation, that is, everyone agrees in principle, but there are differences in implementation, because everyone is prepared to enjoy the benefits of the federation, but no one is willing to make the necessary sacrifices. A European federation is impossible unless its members transfer some of their sovereignty to the federal government. However, all governments are unwilling to make such sacrifices. The three major political agendas of the "European Federal Parliament" are as follows: (1) Mobilize the majority parties in the European Parliament to support the federation; (2) Promote cooperation between these parties; (3) Convene a European constitutional assembly.</p>
<h3>British Coal Miners' Strike Widens</h3>
<p>[Reuters] London, dispatch dated the 8th: The unofficial strike of coal miners in Yorkshire has entered its fifth week today. 26 mines have been completely shut down, 18 mines have been partially shut down, and a total of 43,000 workers are on strike. The loss of coal has exceeded 400,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Behind-the-Scenes Efforts to Mediate the Anglo-Egyptian Dispute Fail</h3>
<p>[Associated Press] Lake Success, dispatch dated the 9th: It was learned today that the behind-the-scenes efforts of the representatives of the UN Security Council to mediate the Anglo-Egyptian dispute have failed to break the deadlock and have now decided to adjourn for 24 hours. This mediation effort was initiated by the Chinese delegation, but it failed to produce a compromise solution acceptable to the majority of the council members.</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Negotiate with the Soviet Union to Break the Stalemate in Atomic Energy Control</h3>
<p>[Associated Press] Lake Success, dispatch dated the 9th: It is reported that Britain will suggest holding talks between Britain and the Soviet Union to break the long-standing stalemate between the East and West on the issue of atomic energy control. British officials said that "other countries interested in this issue" are also welcome to participate.</p>
<p>Britain deeply understands the crisis of failure to agree on how to control atomic energy. After the Soviet Union firmly opposed the principles of the US atomic energy control plan supported by the majority of countries on the 8th and rejected the committee's draft plan for implementing the plan, Britain decided to proceed with the plan for Anglo-Soviet negotiations. In August, Soviet representative Gromyko also expressed agreement with the control of major powers rather than international control when answering questions from British representative Cadogan. This is also one of the reasons for Britain to propose the current plan. Other governments seem to agree with Britain's plan. They firmly believe that continuing the debate in the Atomic Energy Commission will not break the deadlock, and they firmly believe that the control of atomic energy is impossible without the participation of the Soviet Union or any other major power.</p>
<h3>Stalin on Tour to Inspect the Black Sea Region</h3>
<p>[Associated Press] London, dispatch dated the 9th: Radio Moscow broadcast on the 9th that Premier Stalin traveled from Crimea to the Caucasus across the Black Sea on the 6,800-ton "Molotov" on August 19, sailing 300 miles in one day. Stalin was accompanied by the Vice-Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers from Yalta to Saki, but it is not known whether Stalin is still staying in Saki or has returned to Moscow. Saki is Stalin's winter resort. Stalin's inspection of the fleet in the Black Sea proves the Soviet Union's importance of the construction of the Black Sea Fleet and the Black Sea region. On the opposite shore of the Black Sea is Turkish territory.</p>
<h3>British Air Force Dispatched to Strictly Prevent Jewish Aircraft from Attacking</h3>
<p>[Associated Press] London, dispatch dated the 8th: The British Ministry of Aviation revealed on the 8th that it has taken wartime measures because it has received intelligence that the Jews intend to bomb London on the night of the 12th. Royal reconnaissance patrols and radar stations are on standby at all times, night fighters have taken off, and anti-aircraft machine guns and anti-aircraft guns are loaded. All aircraft flying south of the coast on the night of the 12th must be inspected by night fighters. The Ministry of Aviation also said that whether the defensive aircraft will attack aircraft of unknown origin depends on the "circumstances."</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Reach an Agreement to Co-manage the Ruhr Coal Mines</h3>
<p>[Associated Press] London, dispatch dated the 8th: Well-informed sources at the British Foreign Office said on the evening of the 8th that Britain has agreed to the United States jointly managing the Ruhr coal mines, which are the largest source of support for European recovery. This decision may be announced within 48 hours as part of the Anglo-American agreement to increase Ruhr coal production. It is expected that this statement will be announced simultaneously in Washington and London to end the negotiations that have been held in Washington for almost a month. According to this provision, the North German coal mines currently controlled by Britain will be transferred to a new Anglo-American management bureau. The US side guarantees that the Ruhr miners will receive rations higher than the average and guarantees to assist in restoring the railway system on which the Ruhr area relies to import coal production. The statement will not mention the thorny issue of nationalizing the Ruhr coal mines. Although the two sides cannot discuss this issue, because it is not on the formal agenda, there is no decision to be made. Britain believes that coal mines should be nationalized, and the United States hopes that it will be resolved by a citizens' referendum.</p>
<p>[Reuters] Berlin, dispatch dated the 8th: Representatives of Britain, the United States, and France held talks here today on the export of Ruhr coal and coking coal, which will involve the issue of coal consumption caused by the Anglo-American decision to raise the level of German industry.</p>
<h3>The Four Powers Discuss the Korean Issue; The United States Announces Postponement of the Meeting; The State Department Still Hopes that the Soviet Union Will Propose a Solution</h3>
<p>[Associated Press] Washington, dispatch dated the 8th: The State Department announced today that although China and Britain have agreed to the US proposal to hold a four-power meeting on September 8 to discuss the Korean issue, the Soviet Union has refused to participate. The meeting has been postponed, but it has not been cancelled. However, it is difficult to say when it can be held and how the United States will try to break the deadlock in the future. The Soviet Union's reply said that the US-Soviet Mixed Commission has not yet exhausted its wisdom and efforts, and it seems that the Soviet Union will propose other solutions. Brown, the US representative on the commission, also said that he is willing to consider any suggestions from the Soviet Union at any time. Korean right-wing leader Syngman Rhee declared in Seoul: "What do you hope for from the Soviet Union? Now the only thing to do is to submit the Korean issue to the United Nations for handling."</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Calls on the Labor Community to Cooperate</h3>
<p>Workers Dissatisfied with Minimum Wage Standard</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency] Tokyo, dispatch dated the 9th: The Liaison and Coordination Council of the All-Japan Labor Committee convened by the Japanese government held its first meeting in Tokyo on the 8th. Ministers Katayama, Wada, and Yonekubo, as well as other relevant leaders, attended the meeting on behalf of the government. Labor Minister Yonekubo issued a statement: "It is difficult to maintain life with a standard wage of 1,800 yen. I am well aware of this. Therefore, we will increase the supply of goods and increase the real wage. If it is still impossible to maintain life by mid-November, the government will also re-examine countermeasures." Prime Minister Katayama then asked the workers to cooperate and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency] Tokyo, dispatch dated the 9th: After the implementation of the Labor Standards Law, the Japanese government decided to establish a minimum wage system to ensure the lives of workers. However, the current standards are not realistic. Therefore, how to determine the basis for the minimum wage this time is the dividing point for whether the working class supports the Katayama cabinet, which is worthy of attention.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Volunteer Corps in the Dutch East Indies Completes First Training Session</h3>

<h3>Japanese Public Office Screening Committee Considers Purging Ashida Hitoshi</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, August 9th] Following Foreign Minister Ashida's recent remarks in Kyoto regarding political unrest, there has been much speculation here about the subtle relationship between Ashida and Katayama. According to information obtained by this agency, there has been a new development regarding whether Ashida will be purged under the regulations for purging the media. The previous reason for acquitting Ashida was that the English-language "Japan Times" had a circulation of less than 10,000 copies. However, an investigation by a member of the Central Public Office Qualification Screening Committee has revealed that the English-language "Japan Times" had a circulation of far more than 10,000 copies before and during the war, possibly over 20,000 copies. The fact that the newspaper still has a circulation of 12,000 copies under the current severe paper shortage and strict paper controls also provides counter-evidence. It is rumored that a certain committee member has expressed a willingness to resign in order to fight for this matter, and although major news authorities have stepped in to mediate, it is feared that the matter will be difficult to resolve privately. This matter may be related to Ashida's aforementioned remarks.</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Bloody Riots Expand in India, Gandhi Rushes to New Delhi, U.S. Ambassador Mountbatten Discusses the General Situation</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, August 9th] U.S. Ambassador to India Grady visited the Viceroy's House today and spoke with Mountbatten for an hour. Grady declined to disclose the content of the conversation afterwards, saying only that they discussed the general situation in India.</p>
<p>[Reuters, New Delhi, August 9th] Gandhi arrived in New Delhi today, where the riots continue unabated. Within an hour, he met with Indian Prime Minister Nehru, Interior Minister Patel, and Health Minister Mrs. Kaur. Mountbatten specially assigned twelve Indian soldiers as his guards, but Gandhi politely declined. Gandhi has not recovered from his fast in Calcutta, and his health remains weak. Gandhi remains in the sweeper's colony after arriving in Delhi. There has been no indication as to when he will begin a fast for the riots in New Delhi. The overall situation will depend on how the situation evolves.</p>
<p>More Than a Thousand Dead, Vultures Appear in Flocks</p>
<p>The Royal Indian Air Force has officially assisted the government in suppressing the riots starting today. When Gandhi met with Nehru and others, planes were already soaring in the air. The number of deaths in the Delhi riots has increased to over 1,000 today. This is an informal estimate; officials have not released the number of casualties in the past 24 hours. The unburied corpses in the streets have emitted a foul odor, and flocks of vultures have appeared in the sky, from which one can imagine the terrifying situation in the city. Delhi's commercial district has not yet reopened today. Riots broke out again in Connaught Place today, and the police opened fire three times, killing seventeen people on the spot. This was based on the authorities' shoot-to-kill order. Although the relocation of Hindus in Lahore has been completed, rioters set fire to houses along three roads last night. Calcutta is in an unsettling quiet, as Gandhi's departure from the city may cause the bloodshed to occur again.</p>

<h3>Thrift Draft Specifies Standards for Banquets, Cash Gifts for Weddings and Funerals, Prohibition of Gifts During Holidays, Prohibition of All Dance Halls in the City by Year's End</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The city's implementation measures for consumption thrift, regarding general social aspects, are being drafted by the Social Affairs Bureau. The bureau is drafting the draft based on the principles promulgated by the central government and in consideration of local conditions, and will submit it to Friday's municipal meeting for discussion. The main points of the proposed plan are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Standards for thrift in banquets and simple meals: Banquets are limited to ten people per table, with eight dishes and one soup. Simple meals are based on the principle of no alcohol consumption. Food and beverage items that the government prohibits from importing, such as foreign wines, are prohibited. If restaurants have goods such as shark fin, sea cucumber, and abalone, they must either register and report them or sell them within a certain period, after which they are prohibited. There are also limits on the price of dishes, which are graded according to the size of the restaurant, to be discussed and agreed upon by the Restaurant Association. (2) Cash gifts are the principle for weddings, funerals, and celebrations. (3) Gifts are prohibited during holidays. (4) The central government stipulates that dance halls be prohibited by the end of September. The situation in this city is special, and the time is short, making it difficult to do so. It is now planned to eliminate them in three phases by lottery, and they will be prohibited by the end of the year regardless.</p>

<h3>Grand Gathering of New Xiannlin Dance Industry, Thousands of Dancers with No Makeup and Tearful Words, Representatives to Fly to Beijing This Morning to Petition</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The deadline for the dance ban is fast approaching. Dance girls, musicians, dance hall employees, and dance hall owners throughout the city all feel panicked. A temporary meeting was held at New Xiannlin Dance Hall at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Owners Sun Hongyuan, Zheng Weixian, Wang Jingwen, etc., dancers Sun Zhimin, Meng Yan, Li Ling, etc., Western and Chinese pharmacists He Hai, Aranas, Guan Huashi, etc., and workers Tang Zongjie, Mao Zhihai, etc., totaling more than 27,000 people attended. Order at the meeting was maintained by military police in cooperation with the workers' union picket team. Representatives from all parties in the Party, government, and military also attended. New Xiannlin was crowded with people, with no space inside or out. The atmosphere was tense and enthusiastic. It was an unprecedentedly grand gathering in the city's dance industry.</p>
<p>After the meeting opened, Tang Zongjie, chairman of the Dance Industry Workers' Union, gave a speech. After a brief report, he suddenly became emotional and could not speak clearly. He then shouted "We want to eat!" and "Thrift is not creating unemployment!" several times. The entire audience echoed unanimously, and the applause and shouts were continuous for a long time. Subsequently, Sun Hongyuan, Zheng Weixian, He Hai, and others gave speeches in succession, and dancers Sun Zhimin and Meng Yan tearfully pleaded their case. Sun claimed to be a high school student who had lost her family in the War of Resistance Against Japan and had no choice but to work as a dancer. The reason for working as a dancer was that it was not easy to find other jobs in society. Now, if they wanted to ban dancing, where would they find work? Meng Yan said, "Dancers have always been looked down upon by society. A weak woman has already suffered enough in an evil environment. Now, if they want to ban dancing again, aren't they pushing us further into a dead end of despair?" She spoke and wept, and the whole audience was moved. The thousands of dancers who came to the meeting yesterday all washed off their makeup and wore simple clothes and shoes. They listened attentively, and at this point, they all covered their faces and sobbed, and their emotions became even more sad.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Aranas of the Musicians' Union and Senator Wang Xianqing spoke. Wang expressed sympathy for the workers' demands, which won a round of applause. Then, Bai Zhu, a red star from the Paramount in Hong Kong who had recently arrived, also automatically stepped onto the stage to speak. Bai was dressed in a glamorous white dress and spoke softly. The tense situation in the venue was greatly eased.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the entire group originally intended to march, but they were persuaded to give up. It is said that twelve representatives of the dance industry have decided to fly to Beijing this morning to petition the Ministry of Social Affairs, and at the same time, another group of representatives will be elected to visit Mayor Wu and Director Wu again to reiterate their views.</p>

<h3>Investigation of Direct Tax Bureau Auditors' Extortion from Merchants: Zhang Zhongyuan's Letter to the City Council Reports Details</h3>
<p>[Our Report] City Councilor and Director of the Chinese Wooden Furniture Trade Association, Zhang Zhongyuan, previously reported instances of corruption by auditors of the Direct Tax Bureau, notifying Director Pan and Political Affairs Committee Secretary-General Lei, among others. The exposure of this case attracted significant attention from all sectors. Councilor Zhang yesterday presented a detailed report to the City Council regarding the extortion and bribery of investigated members of the association by tax bureau auditors. The original letter stated: "On August 15th of this year, in my capacity as Director of the Chinese Wooden Furniture Trade Association, I, Zhang Zhongyuan, along with Directors Zhu Jianni and Gu Jianting, attended a lottery draw upon notification from the Direct Tax Bureau. According to the bureau's regulations, for every one hundred members of a trade association with two to four hundred members, three would be selected for investigation. Our association has over two hundred and fifty members, so seven should be selected. The host of the lottery at the bureau presented a list containing twenty-five names. Upon review, I found that eight of these were not members of our association. I stated this at the time, and the host removed them. Therefore, only seventeen participated in the lottery, from which seven were drawn, listed as follows:</p>
<p>Store Name Manager</p>
<p>Zhang Senmao Zhang Xianliang</p>
<p>Wufu Cao Caigeng</p>
<p>Zhang Wanli Wang Yongxiang</p>
<p>Qiao Yuantai Qiao Fangfeng</p>
<p>Store Name Manager</p>
<p>Zhu Genji Zhu Jianni</p>
<p>Yang Longxing Yang Longquan</p>
<p>Zhang Wantai Zhang Shouqi</p>
<p>(Note) Qiao Yuantai is a Chinese wooden furniture store that filled out the membership form but has not yet paid membership fees and requested to withdraw from the association, which the association has not approved.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 17th, the businesses selected in the lottery were notified by the tax bureau to submit their account books to the bureau for inspection on the morning of the 18th. The next morning (the 18th), I, Zhang Zhongyuan, sent Wang Wenhao, the bookkeeper from my store, to the bureau with the account books. According to his report, 'The auditors were critical and intimidating during the inspection, nitpicking and demanding tax supplements of over one hundred million yuan.' Subsequently, managers from Zhu Genji, Zhang Senmao, and other investigated businesses also reported similar situations to me, each facing tax supplements ranging from tens of millions to one hundred million yuan. That afternoon, the businesses received phone calls from Zou Wenlong, an official from the tax bureau, inviting them to a meeting at the Jinghua Restaurant. Considering that my store's annual turnover is only over three hundred million yuan, and the tax supplement should not be so high, and having heard rumors of similar extortion in other industries, this phone invitation seemed like an attempt at extortion. I instructed the business owners to attend the meeting to investigate the truth, but to be evasive as much as possible. If it was indeed extortion, I had my own plans. Around 7 p.m., I received a phone call at the Daguan Commercial Plaza from Wang Yongxiang, the manager of my store, saying: 'The auditor in charge of our store's account books, surnamed Wang, said that our store should pay at least one hundred million yuan in tax supplements and 'social expenses,' and that I, Zhang Zhongyuan, needed to meet him in person to discuss it.' At that time, besides sending Shen Wenbin (accountant of Daguan Commercial Plaza) to represent me and deal with him, I wanted to secretly inform Bureau Chief Lou by phone, but I could not find the phone number of his residence. I then called Director Pan, but he was out. So I called Councilors Shao Yongsheng, Yang Fusheng, and Secretary-General Yan Esheng of the Chamber of Commerce to report the situation. At the same time, I received a phone call from Shen Wenbin reporting that the tax supplement and so-called 'social expenses' had been reduced from one hundred million yuan to eighty million yuan, and now further reduced to a minimum of sixty-nine million yuan.' I still instructed them to be evasive and postpone the matter until the next day. That night at 11 p.m., Shen Wenbin, Zhang Xianliang, and Zhang Zhonghui and Wang Yongxiang from my store returned to Daguan Commercial Plaza, all saying that 'Auditor Wang Rentang asked me, Zhang Zhongyuan, to personally go to the bureau the next afternoon to discuss everything.' The next morning (the 19th) at 8:30 a.m., Councilor Yang Fusheng and I went to see Director Pan together. However, he was chairing a conscription association meeting at the City Council, so we went directly to the council. We finally met him around 11 a.m. At that time, Chairman Xu Jiqing of the Chamber of Commerce, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan of the City Council, Chairman Shui Xiangyun of the General Labor Union, and others were present. After hearing my report, they were all extremely indignant. Director Pan instructed me to continue negotiating properly to obtain conclusive evidence before reporting the matter. I immediately called Shen Wenbin and instructed him to still represent me and meet with Wang Rentang to negotiate and obtain conclusive evidence. Around 2 p.m., Shen Wenbin and Zhang Xianliang came to report the results of their negotiations, reducing the amount from 29 million yuan to 23 million yuan (including 13 million yuan for tax supplement, to be paid after receiving notification from the tax bureau, and 10 million yuan for so-called 'social expenses,' to be paid no later than the day after tomorrow (the 21st), with the payment location and interest rate to be notified by phone). Subsequently, other businesses came to report that they had also reached agreements:</p>
<p>Store Name Manager Tax Supplement Social Expenses</p>
<p>Zhang Senmao Zhang Xianliang 7 million yuan 7 million yuan</p>
<p>Zhang Wantai Zhang Shouqi 4 million yuan 10 million yuan</p>
<p>Wufu Cao Caigeng 4 million yuan 10 million yuan</p>
<p>Zhu Genji Zhu Jianni 5 million yuan 9 million yuan</p>
<p>Zhang Wanli Zhang Zhongyuan 13 million yuan 10 million yuan</p>
<p>Yang Longxing Yang Longquan 7 million yuan 7 million yuan</p>
<p>Qiao Yuantai Qiao Fang Note: No report, reason as previously noted</p>
<p>On the morning of the 21st, Zhang Xianliang and Zhu Jianni came to me, saying: 'Zou Wenlong from the tax bureau just called, asking us to pay the social expenses at 11 a.m. today. What should we do?' I instructed Zhang and Zhu to issue a check for 500,000 yuan from the Benqi Service Society's Dade Qianzhuang (the total amount of social expenses for the six businesses was 53 million yuan, pretending to bargain down by 3 million yuan to show sincerity) to obtain evidence for the planned reporting.</p>
<p>Around 8 p.m. on the same day, after returning to Daguan Commercial Plaza from outside, Shen Wenbin and Zhang Xianliang introduced me to Wang Rentang (the tax bureau auditor who inspected the account books of Zhang Wanli and extorted bribes from my representative Shen Wenbin). At the time, Councilor Fei Shusheng, reporter Gu Huiren from the Dagong News Agency, and others were present. Wang Rentang told me: 'Bureau Chief Lou has already sent someone to investigate this case and is willing to return the 10 million yuan of social expenses under my name.' Because I had a trip to Wuxi the next day, I instructed them to continue contacting Shen Wenbin. At 10 p.m. on the 23rd, I returned to Shanghai from Wuxi. Zhang Xianliang and Zhu Jianni reported to me: 'This morning, we received a phone call from Zou Wenlong of the tax bureau, asking us to discuss the payment location before 11 a.m. After arriving as scheduled, Zou Wenlong returned a Chengdu Bank check with the name Deng, totaling 50 million yuan. In the afternoon at 2 p.m., the bureau sent Inspector Miao and another supervisor to investigate, claiming that bribery and accepting bribes are the same crime, and asked us to sign written statements.' I have prepared a detailed written account of the entire incident and request investigation and supervision.</p>
<h3>Initial Court Hearing Investigates, Summons Informant Witnesses</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the case of corruption by Direct Tax Bureau officials, previously reported by Zhang Zhongyuan and others of the wooden furniture industry, eight suspected officials, including Wang Lianlu, have been sent by the bureau to the District Prosecutor's Office for detention and interrogation. Yesterday, the prosecutor summoned the informants Zhang Zhongyuan of Zhang Wanli, Zhang Shouqi of Zhang Wantai, Zhang Xianliang of Zhang Senmao, Zhu Jianni of Zhu Genji, Cao Caigeng of Wufu, and the female owner of Yang Longxing, as well as witness Qiao Fang of Qiao Yuantai, a total of seven people, to court for investigation. The hearing lasted from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. The details of the officials' extortion, how they demanded 50 million yuan in gratuities, and how the suspects returned the checks after the incident were vividly described. After questioning, they were all instructed to return and await further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Tribunal Arraigns Malley, Begins Closing Arguments in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The U.S. Military Tribunal convened at 9 a.m. yesterday, continuing to examine witnesses De Dutrelet and Oberlin. De Dutrelet testified that he had known Cooley for six years. Before August 1st, he met Cooley on Avenue Joffre, where Cooley indicated he wanted to do a transaction that would be easy and profitable. On August 1st, he saw Cooley and Malley drinking together in the Huizhong Hotel bar. Oberlin was then examined, testifying that he met Cooley on Nanking Road on the morning of August 1st. Cooley told him that there would be an easy money-making deal that afternoon and that it was the kind of opportunity where you could take money from the Chinese. Defendant Malley was then examined, and his testimony was consistent with his written statement from the previous day, except he admitted that he had committed a crime in Chicago when he was eighteen. He placed the responsibility for the shooting of Yu Ganxiao entirely on Cooley. After a recess at noon, the proceedings resumed at 1:30 p.m. The prosecutor raised various questions, cross-examining Malley. Malley's attitude was particularly unnatural at this time. He paused to think for a moment before answering even the most important questions with very short responses. His voice was so low that not only was it difficult to hear from the gallery, but the court also had to ask the stenographer to repeat the responses several times to understand their content. The judge also seemed uninterested in Malley's testimony; one judge was chewing gum to relieve boredom. In his testimony, Malley insisted that Cooley held the gun, but when the prosecutor asked which hand Cooley held the gun in, he could not answer. He also admitted that he pushed the injured and bleeding Yu Sheng out of the car while Cooley stood by and watched, without helping.</p>
<p>After the judges asked questions and the prosecutor finished questioning, the judges raised questions, which Malley answered simply. The main points were: (1) Malley had only four U.S. dollars with him when he came to Shanghai from Beijing. (2) Before Malley returned to China, Cooley had promised him a job after he arrived in Shanghai, but Cooley went back on his word after Malley arrived. (3) Before cooperating with Cooley (referring to buying gold bars from Yu Shengxiao), no one had warned him or advised him not to work with Cooley. (4) The meeting with Cooley on the afternoon of August 1st was unexpected and not prearranged. (5) He threw the injured Yu Shengxiao out of the car entirely due to Cooley's threats. Although Cooley did not point a gun at him at the time, he dared not resist because Cooley had the weapon in his hand. At this point, the defendant's attorney stood up to add that Malley had flown to Shanghai from Beijing at 9 a.m. on August 1st and arrived around 11 a.m. Presiding Officer Colonel Palmer then announced the adjournment of Malley's hearing.</p>
<p>The prosecutor presents his views After a five-minute recess, the closing arguments began. First, the prosecutor, based on his own investigation and the summation of the testimony of various witnesses, reported the contents of the case, stating that Malley and Cooley were definitely related to the bloody incident. The two had known each other for years, and their relationship was generally good, so Cooley first sought work for Malley. But after Cooley went back on his word, the relationship between the two deteriorated. Malley's trip to China this spring was entirely self-funded, so after arriving in Shanghai, he spent ten days visiting Cooley, hoping to get compensation, but he was unsuccessful because Cooley had moved. Unable to make a living in Shanghai, Malley joined the U.S. military service. On August 1st, after Malley came to Shanghai, he went to the New Lidu Bar around 3 p.m. and met Cooley. At this time, Malley proposed buying five gold bars, and Cooley came forward to contact Yu Sheng, and he rented a car, which ultimately led to the bloody incident on the Shanghai-Qingpu highway. The prosecutor further stated: "In my opinion, this case involves robbery and murder, and the criminals should be brought to justice."</p>
<p>The defense vigorously attacks Cooley After the prosecutor spoke, the defendant's attorney stood up to defend Malley, arguing that Yu Shengxiao's dying words identified Cooley as the murderer but did not mention the "American." According to the law, this matter was entirely an "individual act" and not a joint enterprise. Therefore, if Cooley is guilty, then Malley is completely innocent and should be exonerated. Moreover, Cooley's numerous statements are contradictory and full of loopholes, while Malley's numerous statements are consistent throughout. Therefore, according to legal principles, Cooley's testimony cannot be considered valid. At this point in the debate, it was already past 5 p.m., and the presiding officer announced the adjournment of the court and that it would reconvene at 9 a.m. this morning to collect all relevant information, give it careful consideration, and then make a judgment. According to observers in the gallery, the closing arguments should not take too long, but a "secret ballot" requiring a three-quarters supermajority is needed to decide whether Malley is guilty, so the announcement of the verdict may not be imminent.</p>
<h3>Yarn Factories Withdraw from the Industrial Association, Hu Boxiang Claims Ignorance</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A reporter yesterday visited Hu Boxiang, a standing director of the Shanghai Industrial Association, to inquire about the resolution passed at the recent joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the National Federation of Yarn Factories, ordering its members to withdraw from the Industrial Association. According to Mr. Hu, the Industrial Association has no knowledge of this matter. He also stated that many textile industry units participate in the Industrial Association, all voluntarily, and that the textile industry occupies a very important position in the Industrial Association. For example, Rong Hongyuan, a standing director of the Shanghai Industrial Association, is the general manager of Shenxin Yarn Factory, and Director Rong is very enthusiastic about the affairs of the Industrial Association and has no intention of "withdrawing."</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Anxious About City Budget Issues, Shortfall Reaches One Trillion, Meeting to Discuss Today</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The issue of the municipal government's budget preparation for next year has become the most difficult task for the municipal government. According to Min Zhoufan, director of the accounting office, yesterday, the total budget after reductions by various agencies still exceeds two trillion yuan, while the municipal government's income for next year will be at most around one trillion yuan.

<p>Inauguration of the Velvet Exhibition, Film Star Li Lihua Cuts the Ribbon (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Yumin Factory Velvet Exhibition Opens, Li Lihua Cuts the Ribbon</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Earth Brand Shuangyang Brand Velvet Exhibition organized by the Shanghai Yumin Woolen Velvet Factory was unveiled at 10 a.m. yesterday at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association by Shen Laizhou, Director of the Woolen Velvet Trade Association. Li Lihua cut the ribbon, and guest Yan Huiqing delivered a speech, elaborating on the excellence of domestic goods, which are no longer inferior to imported goods, making promotion necessary. Finally, Li Runsheng, General Manager of the factory, delivered a speech of thanks.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the exhibition officially began, and the audience was very crowded for a time. In addition to displaying pictures of the factory's production and manufacturing process, there were also twenty award-winning works from the previous knitting competition, displayed around the venue. At the same time, a temporary sales point was attached to the venue, limiting each person to purchasing one set. A lottery was drawn on the spot with evidence, and the special prize winner could receive the right to a "free sea, land, and air tour." The first prize included valuable prizes such as a sofa bed, watch, radio bicycle, and Eversharp fountain pen. It is said that the factory's total prizes this time are several thousand units, with a total value of about 500 million yuan?</p>
<p>Regarding the factory's production situation, because the raw material wool is mostly sourced from the UK and Australia, it is affected by import quotas, so the current output is about 80,000 pounds per month.</p>
<h3>Violations of the General Mobilization Order Will Be Handled by Military Law</h3>

(2) Fugitive soldiers, after being arrested, must not be punished on the spot but should be sent back to the original military agency for disposal according to law.</p>
<h3>Fuxin Factory Rice Case Opens, Zhang Zhixue Takes the Blame for Others</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The case of Fuxin Flour Company No. 1 Factory at 423 Guangfu Road, Zhabei, hoarding 420 dan of rice was sent by the Social Bureau to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation in mid-June. The defendants Hu Zhuping, an employee of the Wuxi office of Fuxin No. 1 Factory, Zhang Zhixue, a cadre of the Women's Christian Association, and Tan Fangxing, the manager of the Wuxi Yuxin Rice Factory, were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office in accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Crimes Against Grain Management in Extraordinary Times. The case was opened in the District Court yesterday, but it was adjourned for further investigation.</p>
<p>[Another Report] Regarding the part of the case involving Zhang Zhixue, who is suspected of being accused, the truth is as follows: Qiu Zhenhua, Zhang Yushi, Guan Wangshi, Zhang Guoji, Bian Zhongliang, and six others are friends with Zhang. In January of this year, they jointly entrusted Pu Zhiyuan, the factory director of Fuxin No. 1 Factory, to purchase 49 dan of rice for their families' needs, based on their friendship. Zhang Zhixue's share accounted for only 4 dan. At that time, due to limited living space, Zhang consulted and agreed with Factory Director Pu to temporarily store the rice in Fuxin No. 1 Factory. When the Social Bureau sent personnel to investigate the factory in March, because Zhang worked for the Women's Christian Association, they mistakenly believed that the rice was purchased and stored by the Women's Christian Association, and thus accused him of violating the Grain Management Regulations. Qiu and the others had sent a letter to the Social Bureau stating the true facts. It is understood that the total number of family members of Qiu and the others is as many as 86 people. Calculated at one shi sheng per person for three meals a day, 49 dan of rice is not enough for two months. Zhang had no intention of making a profit, but he took the blame for others with such a small amount, which was unexpected.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Volunteers, Conscription of Young Men Will Adopt an Indirect Lottery Method</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The city's conscription of 3,000 soldiers this year will be mainly based on the recruitment of volunteers. If there are not enough volunteers, then conscription will be carried out by lottery according to law. However, the city is vast and there are many eligible young men, so a direct lottery is impossible. Therefore, an indirect lottery method will be adopted. The Ministry of National Defense has stipulated that the indirect lottery method is divided into two types: (1) If too few active-duty eligible men are unable to attend the lottery in person, the township (town) chief may draw the lottery on their behalf. (2) If most active-duty men are unwilling to participate in the direct lottery or are unable to attend the lottery in person due to circumstances, representatives of the conscription association may draw the lottery on their behalf. It is also reported that the Civil Affairs Office has received registration lists of requests for deferment of conscription from 26 districts, totaling more than 96,000 people.</p>
<h3>Father's Crime Not Cleared, Daughter's Body Defiled First, Police Officer Uses Coercion and Inducement, Incident Exposed and Accused</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhang Juanjuan, 25 years old, from Suzhou. Last July, her father was detained in the Lujiawan Police Station for drug use. Juanjuan went to deliver food twice a day. A police officer from the station, Lu Lingsheng, 35 years old, from Nanjing, told Zhang that he could find a way to acquit her father. He also invited Zhang to meet him at Room 203, Lushan Apartment, Julu Road. Lu told her that he was still single. Under coercion and inducement, the dream came true, and he repeatedly raped her dozens of times, resulting in a secret pregnancy. However, her father was sentenced to six months in prison by the court and was released after two months. Seeing his daughter's big belly, he knew something was wrong. After questioning her, she argued with Lu. Lu only agreed to pay 500,000 yuan for one birth, and ignored the rest. Juanjuan filed a complaint with the police station, which has now transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling.</p>
<h3>Patient Refused Discharge, Jumps from Building and Dies</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Yao Youcai, a patient in the fourth-floor ward of Guangci Hospital, wanted to be discharged and return home because his condition had not improved after a week of treatment, but was rejected by the French doctor at the hospital, Yidishate. At 6 a.m. yesterday, Yao suddenly jumped from the building and died on the spot.</p>
<h3>Hoping to Save Wasteful Expenses and Benefit Poor Students</h3>
<p>Today is the nineteenth day of fundraising for the "Reader's Bursary," and the deadline has passed more than half way. In these nineteen days, a total of only 42,996,000 yuan has been received. This amount is about one-twentieth less than our final goal of one billion yuan. There is no doubt that this number is too far from the planned plan. If this situation continues, the amount of donations will definitely not exceed 200 million yuan by the time the deadline expires. At that time, it will be difficult for us to fully realize our plan. The facts clearly tell us that it is the vast group of poor students who are eagerly awaiting help who are suffering the misfortune. In this society, countless rich people and local tycoons spend countless amounts of money every day for extravagance and pleasure, a night of revelry, perhaps enough to provide dozens of poor students with tuition for a semester, a luxurious feast, perhaps enough for a poor student's meals for half a year.</p>
<p>We hope that enthusiastic readers can save a little money so that these poor young people will not suffer the misfortune of dropping out of school.</p>

<h3>### Canton-Hankow Railway Massive Embezzlement Case Officials at All Levels Involved, Reaching a Huge Sum of 2.5 Billion</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Changsha Seventh Dispatch] A major corruption and embezzlement case recently occurred in the Canton-Hankow Railway, involving all section chiefs of the railway transportation system and station masters of major stations. The freight rate of the railway increased by 200% starting from August 1st, and station masters took the opportunity to collect packages as much as possible before August 1st, then delayed the delivery of goods, accepting bribes. Former Changsha East Station Master Zhou Yifang, Transportation Section Chief Li Wentao, Deputy Section Chief Zhou Shuxiong, and others colluded to illegally collect approximately 50,000 packages, from which they profited to the huge sum of 2.5 billion yuan. Fearing implication, the Director of the Railway Transportation Department also took advantage of his authority to allocate vehicles, receiving 50,000 yuan for each vehicle allocated. He deliberately protected Zhou, Li, and others by transferring them to other positions to cover up the matter. This was discovered by Jiang Guodong, the Director of the Railway Police Department, who immediately dispatched officers to arrest Zhou, Li, and others from their respective locations and bring them to Changsha for detention. The entire case is currently being investigated by a senior investigator appointed by the department.</p>
<h3>Geological Survey of Zibo Mining Area Boshan Pottery and Materials Industry</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Boshan Fifth Dispatch] As early as the Song Dynasty, more than 700 years ago, Boshan began manufacturing pottery. The products at that time were mostly black. White pottery first appeared in the Ming Dynasty. The raw materials used for pottery, such as coke spar, silica, and feldspar, are abundantly produced in Beiling Mountain and Touwudian in the county. Before the War of Resistance, during the most prosperous period, more than 200 manufacturers were engaged in production, and there were more than 120 large merchants specializing in kiln products. After the victory of the War of Resistance, Boshan was "liberated" by the communist bandits three times. The original larger pottery businesses, even if they were not liquidated, were subjected to struggle, and the pottery industry declined sharply. Currently, only a dozen or so businesses are still continuing production, and the largest of these is the state-run "Shandong Provincial Model Pottery Factory."</p>
<p>The predecessor of the Shandong Provincial Model Pottery Factory was the "Shandong Provincial Pottery Experimental Factory." The factory was founded in April of the 20th year of the Republic (1931) and was located in Daliukeng, Boshan. In July of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), it was renamed to its current name. The young engineer Wang Chengke, only 28 years old, took office as the factory director. When Director Wang arrived, it was just after the second retreat of the communist bandits. The factory was in a state of disrepair and everything needed to be rebuilt. Through his hard work and painstaking management, by September of the same year, the factory had achieved a basic scale and began production. Before the communist bandits entered Boshan for the third time on February 23rd of this year, the factory was already able to</p>
<p>Produce a large quantity of goods, with a monthly output of 210,000 pieces of porcelain (two-thirds of which were electrical porcelain) and 300,000 fire bricks (including special-shaped bricks). All necessary equipment for porcelain manufacturing, such as horizontal boilers, water-tube boilers, vertical and horizontal steam engines, grinders, ball mills, iron bowl machines, and steel brick soil crushers, were fully installed. The manufacturing process is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Raw materials – crusher – rotary crusher – ball mill – mud pump – mud press – horizontal mixer.</p>
<p>(2) Forming – mold making – blank making – billet pressing – trimming.</p>
<p>(3) Glazing – spraying glaze, dipping glaze, immersing glaze.</p>
<p>(4) Firing – kiln construction – loading kiln – firing kiln – unloading kiln – inspection and selection.</p>
<p>(5) Painting (decal, drawing, brushwork) – firing – finished product.</p>
<p>In addition to the manufacture of ceramic products and chemical materials (such as various refractory, acid-resistant, silicon, and magnesium-calcium bricks), the factory also plans to add a glass manufacturing department in the second half of this year. At the same time, the established research laboratory is also planned to be greatly expanded, with analysis, measurement, and research on the composition of various raw materials to make improvements. Unfortunately, in February of this year, the communist bandits "liberated" Boshan for the third time. When they retreated on August 17th of the same year, they swept away all valuable instruments, chemical reagents, and pigments for porcelain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the main machinery did not suffer major damage. During the communist occupation, two machines originally located in the Qingjinlang factory in Nanding were moved to the factory to increase its output. However, to fully restore the factory to its former glory will take more than just a few months of effort.</p>
<p>According to Director Wang, the local magnetic soil has a high iron content and the color is slightly inferior. However, if the entire factory is completely repaired and the machinery and equipment are complete, and if porcelain clay from Wendeng, Jiaodong (which can be used to make high-voltage electrical porcelain and exquisite porcelain), is also used, the raw materials will be sufficient. When the factory has 427 workers (currently only over 100 workers), it will be able to produce 60,000 pieces of porcelain per month (two-thirds of which are electrical porcelain) and 50,000 fire bricks (including special-shaped bricks). The quantity and quality will be better than ever before. At present, the production of Zhens porcelain is still done by hand, the output is small, and the cost is high. With machine manufacturing, the output is large, and the selling price is low.</p>
<p>The glass industry in Boshan is called the furnace material or furnace mining industry.</p>
<p>The main raw materials are stone alkali, white sand, purple stone, foreign alkali, saltpeter, fire saltpeter, green soil, and ganza soil. The tools are furnaces, including sitting furnaces, chute furnaces, flat sheet furnaces, round furnaces, crucible furnaces, blowing pipe molds, pressure machines, and flat sheet stone wheel carts. Before the war, there were a total of 53 factories, with more than 2,000 workers, producing 200 tons per year. The main products were various lampshades, water bottles, and stationery. At that time, they could be sold throughout the country. During the war, due to restrictions by the enemy and puppets, sales were limited to the Jiaoji Railway line. The number of factories was reduced to more than 20, with thousands of workers, and annual production also fell to dozens of tons. After the victory, due to frequent bandit troubles, less than 10 factories were able to maintain their current status, with monthly production of less than one ton. In addition, due to the communist bandits' struggle, they urgently hope that the government will provide effective relief or loans. (Special Correspondent Luo Tian)</p>

<h3>### Yi Tribal Leader Arrives in Chengdu to Petition Demanding Equal Political Participation and Suppression of Rebellion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chengdu Sixth Dispatch] The Yi tribal leader from the Chuanbian area, Zhuo Guanguan, the head of Zhuokeji, in order to support the government's suppression of the rebellion and demand equal political participation, specially sent a representative, the Tusi Abu, to Chengdu to pay his respects to Chairman Deng of the provincial government and present his views on political participation. Yesterday, with the help of an interpreter, the reporter spoke with this knowledgeable Yi youth about the recent situation in the Yi area.</p>
<p>According to Tusi Abu, Zhuokeji is the leader of the four major Tusi in Sichuan Province, governing the four counties of Songpan, Lifan, Mao County, and Maogong, with a vast territory. The Yi people in the area number about one million. The general level of knowledge is average, but they suffer from not being understood by the outside world. The Yi tribe hopes for the opportunity to participate in politics and for equality between Han and Yi.</p>
<p>According to Tusi Abu, before the war, Zhu Mao and his gang disturbed the Chuanbian area, and the Yi people suffered greatly from poisoning. They hold the communist bandits in deep hatred. The government should promptly use some strong force to wipe out the communist bandits, the public enemy of the country. Regarding the rumors of forced opium cultivation in the Yi area, Abu said it was not true. The good Yi people unanimously support the central government's plan to thoroughly ban opium and drugs this year. He hopes that the government will provide more guidance and welcomes people from the mainland to visit and travel for investigation. They have met Chairman Deng several times, with good results. In addition to expressing his condolences, the provincial government has agreed to forward all opinions to the central government. After the completion of their mission, they will return to Li County within a few days to report. (Reporter Zhou Xueduan)</p>

<h3>Wu Kaixian Convenes Rice Industry Representatives to Discuss Food Distribution Issues: Abundant Sources from All Regions, No Reason for Rice Prices to Rise</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Wu Kaixian, Chairman of the Food Distribution Committee, convened responsible persons from the city's Rice Merchants Association yesterday afternoon to discuss the city's food rice issues. More than 20 people including Wan Molin, Qu Zhenhua, Xu Hongren, Zhang Chao, and Hu Xianzhou attended, chaired by Wu as Chairman. He reported on the city's food distribution situation and discussed relevant city supply events, adjourning at approximately 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Food Distribution Committee will establish a storage and transportation office and entrust various rice merchants to purchase food rice from various producing areas. The committee will provide pledge funds for the white rice purchased. Rice merchants will convene a meeting today to discuss detailed measures. It is said that Director Wu will return to Shanghai to make a decision.</p>
<p>Government Decides to Step Up Rationing</p>
<p>It is also reported: It is learned that there are three reasons for the recent rise in rice prices in the city: (1) Due to the once tense military situation in Hankou, the river was sealed, resulting in unsmooth transportation. (2) A large amount of Wuhu rice is exported and smuggled to North China. (3) The new rice has not yet been on the market, and the period between the old and new crops has not yet passed. However, Hankou has now stopped sealing the river, and transportation is smooth. Wuhu was also ordered by the Executive Yuan last Wednesday to strictly prohibit exports to various parts of North China. New rice has also gradually entered the market, so rice prices will only tend to stabilize.</p>
<p>At the same time, in terms of the city's supply, the Food Distribution Committee needs 200,000 shi of rice per month, and approximately 30,000 shi are rationed to public and education personnel, and approximately 25,000 shi are allocated for military food for resident troops and police food, so the city's monthly supply totals more than 250,000 shi. If Shanghai is calculated with a population of 4.5 million, it only needs 450,000 shi of rice per month. The government's current supply has already exceeded 250,000 shi, and the shortage is only about 200,000 shi. The amount of rice arriving from various places can also exceed this number, so there is no shortage of supply. Therefore, there is no reason for rice prices to rise again. Moreover, the government has now decided: (1) to continue to step up rationing, (2) to control the market, (3) to reduce factors that increase rice prices, and (4) to expand the source of food rice. It is heard that a contract has now been finalized with the United States for 120,000 tons of American wheat, and shipment can begin in September after the technical issues have been resolved. In addition, 30,000 tons of Burmese rice and 90,000 tons of Siamese rice are currently being negotiated.</p>
<p>In addition, the United States also has 43,000 tons of rice. The import of the above rice and wheat is estimated to require more than 60 million US dollars, which has been prepared by the Rongjing government. Therefore, there is no problem with the source of food rice. Therefore, after the new rice is on the market, rice prices will tend to fall. However, if rice prices are too low, it will cause harm to farmers due to low grain prices, which is not a good strategy. It is heard that the government will consider purchasing grain in rice-producing areas after the autumn harvest for future adjustment, but the purchase will be based on the principle of not affecting market prices. Currently, Shanghai has hundreds of thousands of bags of rice in stock, and there is also a large amount of flour in stock, so the supply will definitely not be a problem.</p>
<p>Thin Rice Sells Well, Prices Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 7,200 shi of rice and grain arrived in the north and south markets. Japonica rice and early thin rice were still active, and continued to rise by 3,000 to 10,000 yuan. Indica rice, both new and old, arrived, and the source was connected, but sales were still weak, still set high and second weak. The situation of japonica and indica is completely opposite. Baiyuan's new japonica is fixed, and fragrant japonica rice is seen for the first time.</p>
<p>Although the ration price of flour has not changed, raw materials are expensive. Miscellaneous brands of flour are unwilling to sell cheaply due to high costs, and the situation tends to be secretly tight. Wheat bran is firm, soybean cake sales are light, and still stagnant. Soybean oil manufacturers are immovable, but local streets have turned prosperous, rising slightly by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The state of tea beans is sluggish. The supply of yuan wheat is intermittent, and the price is stable.</p>
<p>Red sorghum arrives and sells well, and the price is stable. Corn in North China is picked up at a high price, rising by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. The middle and second grades are lacking and difficult to trade, and the situation is high, pretty, and weak. Sesame from Guangzhou is inquired, weak but turning stable. Raw peanuts are in a slump, falling another 10,000 yuan. Broad beans are rare to come and go, and the market is calm.</p>
<p>The oil market has ups and downs. Soybean oil is selling well, and the price is up 10,000 yuan. Raw oil is extremely sluggish, and the performance is weak by 10,000 yuan. Sesame oil is flat, vegetable oil is firm, and clear oil is firm.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Flour Business Association will open the auction market for trading from 10:00 AM today. Eleven market management committee members and five mediation committee members were elected. Approximately one hundred industry members participated in the market. The commission for flour trading is set at 200 yuan in national currency per bag for both buyers and sellers. Both parties pay half each. The market management rules have been established and sent to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval.</p>
<h3>Domestic Black Tea Transactions, Approximately 250 Boxes Yesterday</h3>
<p>Black tea from the Suzhou and Wuxi areas, which has been thinking about starting operations for a long time, has approached merchants in the market yesterday to negotiate. By the close of the market, approximately 250 boxes had been transacted, but most of them were low-grade old goods, with prices ranging from 365,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan per batch. The market atmosphere continued to be firm and stable. Other varieties, although lacking a certain amount of activity in the street shops and customer gangs, are still secretly being pursued. The asking price is maintained as before by suppliers, and all are unwavering. As for the foreign firm tea market, the process is still quite quiet, because both buyers and sellers are in hesitation.</p>
<p>According to industry sources: Qimen black tea, which has always been loved by the British, is now even more interested in this year's new tea in the area, but the offer is still stingy, and the situation is difficult to open. It is now heard that companies such as Yutai, Wuchang, and Huacha are planning to send telegrams overseas requesting price increases, but whether or not it is possible is difficult to predict at this time.</p>
<h3>Rayon Stable</h3>
<p>The rayon market was stable yesterday, with sparse trading. In the morning, the asking price for No. 120 bright, Jin San Ma, and Tianqiao was 25.78 million yuan, and the transaction price at noon was 5.8 million yuan. The asking price was 6 million yuan. In the afternoon, the transaction price was 5.9 million yuan, and Dongyang asked for 6 million yuan, which was 100,000 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Factory warp yarn trading was still only in lots yesterday, with transaction prices the same as the previous day. Raw warp yarn for immediate delivery was priced around 18.5 million yuan after discounts. Because of slightly better sales, silk quilt covers from rural areas held firm yesterday, rising 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of Dacheng Xinghua's strong fabrics were mixed. Checked crepe was still asking for 40,500 yuan, but there were no transactions.</p>
<h3>Qinhuangdao Coal Awaiting Transport to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] As of August 21st, the total amount of coal awaiting export from Qinhuangdao had reached 60,680 tons, which is extremely important for Shanghai, which is suffering from a power shortage.

<h3>Goldsmiths' Operating Expenses Deemed Too High by Director Wu</h3>
<p>Representatives of the goldsmith industry in this city visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau at 4 p.m. yesterday to present their requests regarding the operating expenses for resuming the trading of gold ornaments and legitimate profits. The operating expenses they listed were 40 percent (including donations, taxes, chemicals, labor costs, staff commissions, packaging, coloring, molds, material losses, and others accounting for 15 percent, and interest accounting for 25 percent), and the profit was 20 percent, totaling 60 percent. It is said that Director Wu considered this cost too high and will discuss it again after Wu Min returns to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee Holds Ad Hoc Meeting; Principles for Exporting Yarn and Cloth from Private Factories Acceptable</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee held an ad hoc meeting at 5 p.m. on the 8th, chaired by Liu Siying, with more than ten committee members present. The matters discussed were: (1) Regarding the processing fees for cotton yarn spun on behalf of the Spinning and Weaving Adjustment Committee, it was decided that the fee for 20-count standard yarn would be 3.8 million yuan per piece (previously decided at 4 million yuan). The processing fees for other counts of yarn would be calculated proportionally. (2) The previous request from private yarn factories to export yarn and cloth was, in principle, acceptable. In the future, the private yarn factories would provide the yarn and cloth, and the Import and Export Control Committee would find ways to export it. It was decided to discuss it further with the committee. (3) The procedures and methods for purchasing yarn spun on behalf of the committee from foreign cotton in the first and second quarters were decided.</p>
<h3>Actual Sales of Yarn and Cloth Launched; Prices Increased Yesterday</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was driven by actual sales yesterday, and trading was brisk, with prices rising across the board. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose to 18.35 million yuan, a rebound of 650,000 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>Actual sales of cotton cloth gradually increased yesterday, and businesses began to switch from selling to buying, with even stronger buying interest from retail investors. The market trend was directly upward. As a result, Dragon Head fine cloth was raised to 500,800 yuan due to buying from all sides, an increase of 10,000 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>China Textile Construction Sells Cloth [Our Dispatch] The China Textile Construction Company opened sales of 23 types of cotton cloth and 1 type of bed sheet as usual yesterday, with allocation prices similar to before. Because the cloth market was quite brisk yesterday, those who went to purchase were very enthusiastic. A total of 37 factories were allocated 3,880 bolts of cloth. 136 cloth merchants were allocated 46,960 bolts of cloth, and 1,210 bed sheets. 20-count extra fine cloth was priced at 392,000 yuan, and someone absorbed an additional 10,000 yuan. Straight tribute yarn increased by 46,000 yuan, and market sentiment was firming.</p>
<h3>Flour Re-export Permits Directly Issued by the Ministry of Food</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Since the Ministry of Food announced the measures for flour re-export quotas, the total amount of flour from factories in Jiangsu Province and the Shanghai-Nanjing area for shipment in August was 600,000 bags, allocated to 26 factories. Among them, the five major factories, including Mianxin, Maoxin, Fufeng, Huapan, and Yutong, accounted for half of the total amount. The previous allocation ratio was designated by the Flour Industry Association of the Fourth District, according to the actual production volume of each factory, with 34.89 percent of the approved export volume. Previously, in order to facilitate the application of each member, the Fourth District Association requested the Ministry of Food to issue the re-export permits to the association for distribution to each factory. However, there was no response for a long time, so Qian Zhonghan, the managing director of the association, was dispatched to Nanjing to make a request. Qian has already returned to Shanghai, and the Ministry of Food did not approve the association's request to issue the re-export permits in total. The application for the issuance of re-export permits for the approved export volume of each factory in August has been approved by the Ministry of Food, and each factory shall prepare a document and apply directly to the ministry for issuance, with the association affixing its seal for certification. In addition, the re-export quota for September is approaching, and each factory should fill out a list of the actual daily output according to the forms previously issued by the Ministry of Food and submit it on a weekly basis, which will be forwarded by the association to the ministry for approval. Those who fail to submit it by the deadline or do not fill it out according to the regulations will be deemed to have voluntarily given up their quota.</p>

(5) It was decided that the scope of discussion at the conference would be matters related to textile industry production. It is said that the conference venue is currently under discussion.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Spot cotton prices continued to rise yesterday because yarn factories' buying interest was not strong and the prices offered were not high. Traders were firm and trading was very brisk, with more than 2,400 bales traded throughout the day. Prices increased by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the price for delivery to the factory was 2.335 million yuan for Lingbin, 2.17 million yuan and 2.2 million yuan for Shashi, and 2.17 million yuan for Hankou fine lint. The price for warehouse delivery was 2.22 million yuan for Mitelin, 2.2 million yuan, 2.25 million yuan, 2.3 million yuan, and 2.335 million yuan for Lingbin.

<h3>Calculation of Tip Money for Reporting Black Market Gold and Currency Transactions Changed</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] After the official exchange rates for gold and US dollars were announced, the reporter inquired with the National Bank yesterday about whether there had been any changes in the calculation of tip money for reporting black market transactions. It was learned that according to the regulations on rewarding those who report gold and foreign currency transactions on the black market, the tip money for the informant is calculated based on the value of the confiscated goods converted into national currency. Now that there are new regulations for the exchange rates of gold and US dollars, the calculation should be based on the government's newly set exchange rates. In addition, once a black market foreign exchange telegraphic transfer is uncovered, the seized evidence should also be rewarded in comparison with foreign currency in order to encourage reporting.</p>
<h3>Consolidated Bonds Weak, Foreign Stocks Remain Buoyant</h3>
<p>Consolidated bonds were flat yesterday, with the rest declining. Consolidated C opened at 14,400 yuan, with the highest price no more than 14,500 yuan, retreating to 13,800 yuan at the close. Runde advanced from 550 to 538, and Dacheng New advanced from 503 to 555. As a result, compared to the previous close, Consolidated A, B, and E each fell by 600 yuan, Consolidated C also fell by 800 yuan, Consolidated D was the only one that was flat, and the turnover was still only around 6 million yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to be buoyant yesterday, with the Guangdong group and the banking group absorbing more shares, and that stock rose the most. Yisha had 5,000 shares absorbed by the banking group, and Dacheng Securities group and foreign company group sold. Yisha opened at 90,800 yuan in the morning, with the highest price no more than 92,900 yuan, retreating to 92,000 yuan at the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha, British Union, Jardine Matheson, Shipping, and Telephone rose slightly, while Yeguang, Paper, and Steel each rose by half a percent, and Xiangtai rose by slightly less than 10 percent.</p>
<h3>Transactions Remain Sparse; Fluctuations in Chinese Stocks Narrow</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were still lifeless yesterday. Outside the market, the demolition of telephone lines and the tightening of inquiries by weaving companies invisibly constrained Hengtong's activities. Transactions inside the market also remained sparse. Except for the indirect and slight stimulus from foreign exchange and foreign stocks, and the stubborn resistance of Multifarious No. 116 and No. 152, it still presented a deserted scene. However, there was still a residual force after the close, and the asking price was slightly tired. Although Xinguang and Jingfu were slightly constrained by the environment in the middle and retreated slightly after rising, the exhaustion of chips made it easier to support the closing price.</p>
<p>The opening was high in the morning. After the opening of Shiyong Yarn, it rose to 241 yuan after being bought by No. 10 and others. No. 36 and No. 223 both sold, and after retreating to 238 yuan, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate had changed slightly. No. 116 and others came in, and the buying sentiment recovered slightly, rising back to 244 yuan. No. 223 and No. 14 still sold hard, retreating to 241 yuan. However, foreign stocks continued to rise. The interest rate outside the market opened low at 12 cents and 16.5 cents, and No. 116 and No. 22 bought, rising to 245 yuan. However, the stricter inspection of telephones by the authorities inevitably hit the activities of the movers and shakers. No. 105 and others sold off, and No. 99 also supplied Shiyong Yarn, gradually falling to around 239 yuan. Until 11:30, No. 155 and others came to buy at the low, and No. 218 also entered after exiting. Shiyong Yarn closed at a price of 239 yuan and 241 yuan, and the asking price tended to rise after the close.</p>
<p>As a result, compared to the previous close, spot delivery stocks Xinguang, Jingfu, Shiyong Yarn, Xinyi, and Meiya rose slightly, Huati fell slightly, Xinhua, Qinxing, and Yonggong were flat, Zhongfa Matches fell by half a percent each, and Rongmeng, Datong, Jinglun, and Lian were all flat, Underwear and Zhongfang rose slightly, and China Silk and Commerce fell slightly. Among the forward delivery stocks, Feng fell by half a percent, Shiyong Yarn, Xinyi, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing rose slightly, Meiya was still flat, and the old stocks outside the market were still stable.</p>
<h3>Request to Extend Forward Delivery Trading</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Stock Exchange submitted a letter to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs last week, requesting that the three-month trial period for forward delivery trading approved by the two ministries be extended, as it will expire at the end of September of this year. The words "trial" will be removed, and no time limit will be added. In addition, the exchange is scheduled to hold a meeting of the standing directors at 4 p.m. today.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Student Screening No Longer Held as Ordered by Ministry</h3>

We forwarded the letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education for inquiry, and we have now received the following reply:</p>
<p>In reply: We recently received a letter from your newspaper forwarding a question from reader Zhu Yiqing asking whether the student screening in the recovered areas will continue to be held. This office has been holding screening events for more than a year, but recently received an order from the Ministry to terminate them and no longer hold them. We hereby reply for your information and transmission. Sincerely, Social Services Section of Shenbao, Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, August 30th.</p>

<h3>Beware of Pickpockets</h3>
<p>A reader submits a warning</p>
<p>Editor: I am an employee of a hardware store. This morning, I wrapped 50 "shuttle cores" and "bottom plate springs" destined for the dyeing and weaving factory on Changshou Road in newspaper, tied them with a handkerchief, and hung them on the handlebars of my bicycle. When I reached the entrance of Yitaixing Coal Ball Factory on Maigen Road, I suddenly felt that I couldn't pedal. I stopped and saw that the rear wheel chain was wrapped with a ring of yarn. I bent over to pull the yarn away, and when I looked up, the items on the handlebars had disappeared. I immediately realized that this was the work of pickpockets, but there was no way to chase them. I think similar things must happen often, so I ask your column to publish this to make everyone who carries items on bicycles aware and careful. Thank you!</p>
<p>Sincerely, Reader Zhang Cunchong, September 3rd.</p>
<h3>An Old Mother Longs for Her Son</h3>
<p>I am an old widow with only one child, named Hu Lingen. In the spring of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1938], he secretly left home and went to the rear to join the army. In the autumn of the following year, he sent a letter from Shaanxi. Since then, until the victory of the war, there has been no letter. I have seen people returning home and reuniting, but there is still no news of my Lingen. How many days do I have left in this world at the age of 60? Therefore, I have asked people to inquire many times, but my longing is still not answered.</p>
<p>Now, I ask your newspaper to publish my letter and beg kind people everywhere to help me find him, so that our family can be reunited. How grateful I would be! My son is named Hu Lingen, also known as Yunpu, 26 years old, from Hutai, Wuxi. (Mailing address: Yao Ahe, c/o Zhang Tongshun Store, Hutai, Wuxi.)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Windy and Rainy Night</h3>
<p>— Lan Hui</p>
<p>From the distant, abruptly rising peaks, sweeping one's gaze over the undulating hills like blue waves, and casting it upon the great bend of the Kunrong River, one can see a few Western-style houses nestled beside it like turtles; that is Zhihua Middle School.</p>
<p>Rain drifted down from the sky. The time was already late, and the bell had long ago clearly announced: the last class of the afternoon had ended.</p>
<p>The girl, Miao Jingying, rustled the pages of her book, searching for something, and turned her head to say to Niu Weineng, who was sitting in the back row:</p>
<p>"Niu, why are you sitting alone in the classroom instead of going out to play with them?"</p>
<p>"Hmm," he stopped writing, turned his gaze out the window, yawned, and said, "It's raining outside, the roads are muddy, there's nothing fun to do outside, so I might as well sit in the classroom and review my lessons."</p>
<p>"Ah, that's what diligent students think." She said admiringly, and smiled slightly; a letter, like a fallen leaf, floated from her open book to Niu Weineng's feet. He quickly noticed it, bent down</p>
<p>—"To Miss Miao Jingying," the letter was hers! It was still unopened; he quickly stood up</p>
<p>"Miao!" He handed the letter to her as she was about to step out of the classroom door, then returned to his seat.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Night.</p>
<p>The classroom was filled with the smoke of tung oil, which stained the lives of some young people.</p>
<p>The school servant announced outside the classroom door: "Niu Weineng—which one is Niu Weineng? The Dean of Students wants to see you!"</p>
<p>Hearing that it was the Dean of Students, it was a bit of a headache: his cold face, like winter, made people shiver at the sight of him; he never easily called students to speak with him; could it be a disaster today? Niu Weineng put down his book, with a fearful heart, somewhat panicked, took an umbrella from the corner of the room, and walked towards the office…</p>
<p>"Report!"</p>
<p>"Come in."</p>
<p>He timidly approached the desk and respectfully bowed to the Dean of Students.</p>
<p>The Dean of Students seemed not to have seen him enter, and continued to write something with his head down; after a long, long time, he slowly raised his head and said coldly:</p>
<p>"Oh, Niu Weineng, you've come!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Dean." His heart was pounding, and he tried his best to calm himself and answered respectfully.</p>
<p>"Do you know the saying, 'A small pond cannot raise a flying dragon'?" The Dean of Students stared intently at Niu Weineng with a meaningful gaze.</p>
<p>"Yes." He replied blankly.</p>
<p>"Do you understand the meaning of the saying, 'A great man dares to act and take responsibility'?" The Dean of Students pressed again.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"! Aha, that's good." The Dean of Students stood up with a subtle look, a confident smile appeared on the corner of his mouth, and he spoke one word at a time: "Then—now, you go down, pack your luggage, and leave the school tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>"Why?" Niu Weineng was shocked.</p>
<p>A dismissive answer: "The school is expelling you."</p>
<p>"What have I done wrong?" Niu Weineng's heart was breaking; he felt like he had been struck suddenly, and all the blood rushed to his head; but he tried his best to restrain the excitement of his emotions.</p>
<p>"A great man should stand up and take responsibility for what he has done wrong; look at you, you look like you can't even count two hundred coppers…, " The Dean of Students began to pace back and forth in the room.</p>
<p>"What do you mean, 'can't count two hundred coppers'? What exactly have I done wrong?" He asked as sternly as before.</p>
<p>"You know yourself." Still a cold answer.</p>
<p>"The school can't just expel people without a reason, can it?" Like a erupting volcano, Niu Weineng shouted angrily; at this moment, all he had was self-confidence and honesty, and the heavy fear from before had disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>"No reason, huh!" The Dean of Students stopped pacing, and his originally stiff face was now covered with a layer of terrible gloom, and these words were forced out from between his teeth: "I'll tell you: Miao Jingying reported you!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Miao Jingying reported you!" The Dean of Students repeated impatiently, then closed his mouth tightly, as if his responsibility was over and he didn't want to say another word; then he looked up, staring at the ceiling in a daze.</p>
<p>"Dean…" Niu Weineng's lips trembled.</p>
<p>"No need to say more!" The Dean of Students waved his hand dismissively, and pointed to the door with his finger: "Now you go down, I can't decide on this matter; we'll decide everything when the principal comes.—I've already sent someone to invite the principal."</p>
<p>The wind and rain, carrying mud and sand, whistled and beat against Niu Weineng's body, and all he saw was a chaotic darkness! As deep as the sea…</p>
<p>With a trace of confusion, he entered the classroom; facing him was Zhang Zeya, who was known as the big mouth in the class, and as soon as they met, he went straight to the point:</p>
<p>"Niu Weineng! What did the Dean of Students call you for?"</p>
<p>Niu Weineng did not answer, and walked straight to Miao Jingying.</p>
<p>"Tsk tsk, it's terrible! The Dean of Students spoke to him!" Zhang Zeya, who did not get a reply, grumbled dissatisfiedly behind him</p>
<p>"Miao! Why did you report me?" Niu Weineng's voice trembled with emotion</p>
<p>Miao Jingying stood up in surprise, stayed for a while and then slumped back down, crying on the desk;……………</p>
<p>The eyes of all the classmates were focused on the two of them;………</p>
<p>…………………….</p>
<p>The principal came, and Niu Weineng was summoned to the office again.</p>
<p>"That's how it's decided!" the principal said to the Dean of Students, then turned his face to him: "Niu Weineng, the school has decided to expel you."</p>
<p>"Decided to expel me?" Niu Weineng couldn't quite believe his ears; but this was the truth! In the dark office, an oil lamp like a ghost fire flickered on the hideous faces of the principal and the Dean of Students.</p>
<p>"Yes. It's decided to expel you, yes, young people are often easily moved by emotions, … the ancients also had the saying, 'No man is perfect, and no one can avoid making mistakes,' even sages can't avoid making mistakes! It doesn't matter if you take the wrong path, turning back is the shore, you can start over; you should go back and let family life cleanse your mind, it might be good for you…"</p>
<p>"I'm not going back! What right does the school have to expel me?" Infinite anger took over him, and Niu Weineng interrupted the principal.</p>
<p>"What right? There's evidence!" The principal replied coldly.</p>
<p>"Where's the evidence?" Anger rose even higher, Niu Weineng's body trembled with excitement, his voice also trembled violently, and his eyes burned with white-hot fire.</p>
<p>"Look at yourself! Is this the attitude a student should have towards a teacher?" The Dean of Students said condescendingly to Niu Weineng, and glanced at the principal.</p>
<p>"Okay, give it to him to see for himself."</p>
<p>The Dean of Students obediently took out a Western-style letter from the desk drawer and handed it to Niu Weineng.</p>
<p>Ying—</p>
<p>You said: Who doesn't love bright roses? Who doesn't love rich and fragrant roses? ……… "Good flowers don't bloom often, good times don't last"! The door of youth will not always be open to those who hesitate, Ying! For the gifts of the creator, I hope that in the quiet Yangliu Lakeside of Baishui Park, we can have a spring date! Amen.</p>
<p>Not knowing what was going on, Niu Weineng looked at every word on that Western-style letter as if he had seen a ghost, and silently handed it back to the Dean of Students.</p>
<p>"Now, you go down and prepare everything, and you must leave the school before ten o'clock tomorrow morning!" The principal struck a match, lit a cigarette, and leaned back, blowing rings, and said calmly.</p>
<p>"Principal! I…"</p>
<p>"No need to say more, get out! This is the school rule!" The Dean of Students shouted angrily, and pushed Niu Weineng out of the office.</p>
<p>Back in the classroom, at his seat, Niu deeply buried his head, covering his face with trembling hands, and a layer of indescribable bitterness covered his heart.</p>
<p>The news that Niu Weineng was going to be expelled, like his own grand theory: "I told you, good people only do stupid things! Look at him, he's always reading, you think he's studying hard? Hehe! Wrong, that's not the case, he's actually… hehe, 'Sister, I love… love you'; so I said, those who are always reading are not good things!—You, you, you belong to this category." Then, he pointed at a classmate next to him with a finger, and all the male students in the classroom burst into laughter.</p>
<p>"Bullshit! Go to your mother!" The one who was pointed at protested loudly.</p>
<p>"You can know a person's face but not their heart, a beast in human skin!"</p>
<p>"Amitabha, to hell with it! One less A student, and 'I' will be one place higher!"…</p>
<p>The idle gossip of the classmates, like a flying gust of wind, kept blowing in his ears; a fire of poison was burning in Niu Weineng's heart, sorrow and hatred took over his entire mind, he could no longer bear it, he stood up, ran over, opened the classroom door with his hand, let the wind and rain rush in, he ran out…</p>
<p>Night; deep night! Thunder and lightning mixed with storms, from that vague illusion, waved the whip of unreason, composing a miserable song. …</p>
<p>The next day, the wind and rain stopped.</p>
<p>On the bulletin board in front of the office, a new notice was posted, with a few short sentences:</p>
<p>"After investigation, Niu Weineng, a student in class X of this school, has improper conduct and is hereby expelled to serve as a warning to others! This is the notice."</p>
<p>A group of classmates stood in front of the bulletin board, and the big mouth Zhang Zeya was also squeezed inside, pointing and gesturing: "Ah, Niu Weineng didn't return to the dormitory to sleep all night last night! His bed is next to mine, and it was empty until dawn."</p>
<p>"According to a fisherman, he saw a dead body floating on the river this morning…" Another classmate reported the news and speculated. ……</p>
<p>At this moment, a panicked classmate ran into the office, panting.</p>
<p>In the office, the principal was leisurely smoking a cigarette, and the Dean of Students was pacing calmly.</p>
<p>"Principal, the love letter to Miao Jingying was written by me!"</p>
<p>Like a loud spring thunder, the principal was horrified and stiffened, and the Dean of Students stopped walking; their bodies were trembling, and they were stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>Outside the office, a wave of infinite grief and anger was set off.</p>
<p>…………………….</p>
<p>In the garden of the living, there was a beautiful fruit tree that was destroyed by the storm. ……………</p>
<h3>Collected Lectures of Blok</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Recently, Lindsay, a British scholar, has newly translated a collection of lectures by the Soviet poet Alexander Blok (1880-1921), a total of six articles. The title "The Spirit of Music" is quite misleading, as it is not specifically about music. Blok's "Spirit of Music" has something of the meaning of the Christian "Holy Spirit." He spoke of the general lack of this spirit before the revolution.</p>
<p>These lectures were apparently given during the revolutionary period, and their exposition of Christian doctrine is quite clear. It is a pity that the translator did not choose to translate some of Blok's beautiful poems, which is a loss.</p>
<p>But this book also talks about music, and that is the third lecture, "Art and Revolution." Blok wanted to link Wagner with Soviet Communism, and through the declarations of Marx and Engels, he mocked the general "giggling women and indifferent officials" who wanted to "starve Wagner." Blok shouted, "When the sound of revolution shakes in the air, Wagner's art is a strong answer."</p>
<p>But later, the Soviet Union thought that Wagner, Mozart, Beethoven and other music masters had nothing to do with politics, that they were all arts of the upper class, and should be banned. However, recently, these musical saints have been revered again.</p>
<p>This collection will not increase Blok's reputation outside of political circles. To remedy this defect, we should translate his poems well in the near future.</p>
<h3>Wuyou Temple</h3>
<p>— Ye Dingluo</p>
<p>——Jiazhou Six Records, Part 2</p>
<p>When you come to Jiazhou, many friends will talk about Wuyou Temple and Giant Buddha Temple as famous attractions here.</p>
<p>I have also visited many famous places. The so-called famous attractions are not necessarily particularly outstanding places, but they have been highlighted by a famous figure in a certain era. Therefore, people of later generations all come here to visit in admiration. The ancients who highlighted the famous attractions mostly came from a temporary sense of excitement, and the modern people who visit the famous attractions mostly come from a sudden pleasure. Therefore, the so-called scenic area is actually like a potted landscape, a corner of the land for people to enjoy, its value is really less important to the community than the countryside that truly produces crops. However, famous attractions are, after all, places that many people manage.</p>
<p>In such a bad situation, to be able to forget all the worries of the present and the future one day, and to go to the mountains and forests to walk around recklessly, is really a rare blessing in life, which does not require much capital, and there is no need to have struggles with people. Why not do it?</p>
<p>In the morning, I was awakened by the noise of a thief made by my neighbor. As someone who is not a police officer, I felt that there was no need to interfere in this kind of event, and I was afraid of hearing this unpleasant sound, so I quickly got up, locked the door, found a friend, and went to visit Wuyou Temple together.</p>
<p>I bought some dry food on the street, walked out of Anlan Gate in the southern part of Jiading that is close to the water. The picturesque landscape made me forget the noisy city behind me, and I stood with my friend on the dock for a while, watching countless ships leaping in the waves by the river; the crowds crossing the river and countless boatmen made a deafening noise.</p>
<p>From the chaotic stone beach under the dock, I boarded a small covered ferry. The boatman followed the current, rowing towards the shore upstream, and then put it into the middle of the stream, allowing the water to push the boat towards the foot of the mountain on the opposite bank. Sitting on the boat, following the rise and fall of the waves, watching the turbulent Minjiang River and the Dadu River merge, countless wave boats floated like toys in this stream; the rocky hills of Giant Buddha Temple and Wuyou Temple gradually approached us, and I felt very spectacular.</p>
<p>The boat floated past the foot of the Giant Buddha Temple Mountain, and the Giant Buddha, standing majestically between the two stone walls, could be seen from afar. Because, although it is said to be at the foot of the mountain, it is actually still far away, so it can be seen. If it were really at the base of the Giant Buddha, one could only see a part of the Buddha's body below the base that is covered with messy trees. Comparing the boats on the river with the Giant Buddha in the mountains, one can only say that it is like an ant walking under a bamboo shoot?</p>
<p>The boat approached the foot of Wuyou Temple Mountain, and I saw countless stone eyes on the rock at the foot of the stone mountain, formed over countless years by the iron arrowheads on countless bamboo poles on countless boats. Several stone cracks, like those chiseled out by a file, were formed by the force of water over countless years. The power of water is indeed greater than the power of the mountain, but the mountain has stood still for countless years.</p>
<p>Leaving the boat and landing on the shore, I walked from the beach towards the stone steps, winding up the mountain. The unique tall and thin bamboo bushes of Sichuan, bending in all directions, were like objects standing in the aisles; there were originally many other large trees in between. Moss grew on the stone steps, making people feel like they were walking into a green net. It was a not very sunny autumn day, and the air was a bit humid. Sitting down in the cool shade halfway up the mountain, looking at the stone carvings on the wall, I saw that there were more than just my friend and I visiting the mountain. Many students and government officials' families were walking up the mountain, and there were also many people selling food and delivering meals. Naturally, since this is not the private property of my friend and I, and people who come here to visit do not need to buy tickets, why not make it lively, even if it is a cloudy day?</p>
<p>Walking up the mountain from here, walking to the end of the stone steps, there is a clean dirt road that leads directly to the mountain gate of Wuyou Temple. The so-called mountain gate is more luxurious than the yamen of various places. This temple is quite magnificent, and what makes it magnificent is not the so-called solemn Buddha statues or ancient-style halls, but many brightly painted plaques and couplets. With exquisite religious slogans and signboards, it is like a newly opened shop, making us know that the monks here have also acquired the minds of merchants, and are using the Buddha's holy place to run businesses in the nature of tea houses, restaurants, and hostels. After all, in modern times, the great benefactors who burn incense and give alms have decreased, what do some bald men who do not serve as attendants to officials, dignitaries, local tyrants, and wealthy gentry eat?</p>
<p>We ate dry food and tea in their living room, and bought a few rubbings. The Arhat Hall in the back is a place where you can stay for a while, because there are more men and women visiting the temple. This temple has become a social place, and we who have no way to socialize have no choice but to look at the dull appearance of the clay figures. In the middle of the five hundred Arhats sitting in rows, the statues of Ji Dian and the Mad Monk are sculpted at the intersection of the walkways. These two stories contain social and satirical poor monks, who are regarded by many as men reincarnated as Arhats, but are actually warm-hearted and upright people who despise the hermits and pity the world's streams, so they talk nonsense, and are afraid of being beheaded, so they have to pretend to be crazy and act foolish. Perhaps there are some. However, the statue really cannot convey this kind of depressed spirit.</p>
<p>In the center of the Arhat Hall is a statue of the Wuyou God. This Wuyou Temple is the temple of the Wuyou God. I don't know where the name Wuyou comes from. It is said that at the beginning, because Guanyin Bodhisattva had worldly thoughts, she turned into a hideous monster. I, like many tourists, have no ability to explain this untraceable legend and name. Walking out of the Arhat Hall, the sky released clear light. Before leaving the city, I heard that there lived a scholar who could also be said to be a poor scholar. The receiving monk inquired and knew that he had already left, and our interest in visiting then shifted to the Giant Buddha Temple.</p>
<h3>"Earthy Rustiness"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>In the summer month of Bingzi, I rested with friends at the Dayou Farm in Songjiang at night. Returning, I composed a poem, and two of its couplets say: "The bright moon shines on the turned-over thousand-layer willow, the cool wind blows the stars of a pond into chaos; the environment is secluded, making the sound of frogs feel silent, the night is quiet, making the smell of earthy rustiness faintly audible." The three words "earthy rustiness" seem quite obscure, but in fact, I am not imitating the ancients. It is the Iron Ox Temple Poem: "Broken horns with green moss, hoof marks with earthy rustiness" that has already said it before me.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Perhaps the news was too tight, and the timing was unfavorable, Yaoqun never found a trace of a comrade (the way to find comrades: one, suspicion—relying entirely on observation, with no obvious signs. Two, secret code; three, special action; four, hidden language; five, transitional dialogue, these five steps are the way comrades approach each other) Originally, in a city as big as Tianjin, there were only a dozen working comrades, how could they meet anytime and anywhere? However, the "French Concession" was the area designated by the headquarters for stationing, and Yaoqun hoped to meet one or two people.</p>
<p>Walking past several hostels, Guanqun chose the China Decoration Hotel, and coincidentally, room 27 was vacant, so he prepaid ten yuan for the room fee, and settled on it. Here, because of the French relationship, the Japanese invaders and their lackeys did not deeply penetrate. Except for the tea boy asking Qun to fill out a registration form with his name and whereabouts, there was no other trouble. Yaoqun only wrote the three characters "Miss Yu Xiaojie" in the name column.</p>
<p>This number 27 was in the back of the bottom floor. Because the hostel door had not yet been marked with a secret sign, and the names of the travelers were not immediately posted on the "overview" sign, Yaoqun was afraid that the little tiger would come back quickly and it would be troublesome to find him, so he ran to the door and deliberately asked the traveler's reception desk for information, while waiting for the little tiger, and preparing to find an opportunity to print a mark on the outside of the door. All the old fort people knew the use of this secret sign.</p>
<p>Yaoqun was asking the receptionist two questions when he saw a "person" walking in through the gate. A person, but why put a parenthesis symbol on it? This shows that this guy is too unusual: at first glance, it is absolutely impossible to define it as male or female, because its actions, demeanor, physique, posture, etc., all look like men, but the clothes and dress are women's style—shirt, short skirt, knee socks, half-high-heeled leather shoes, high chest and lungs, and a vaguely exposed—same, it is even more impossible to determine what ethnicity or nationality: high nose and sunken eyes, plus dark brown curly hair, revealing the outline of a Westerner, but the face, eyes, expression, etc., have a very strong Eastern color.</p>
<p>"You've worked hard," this neither male nor female, neither Chinese nor Western guy greeted the two receptionists as soon as he entered the gate. This opening made Yaoqun, who was surprised as if he had seen a rare sight, even more surprised: because this guy's fluent Beijing accent, the speaking rhyme of a Westerner, and that sharp and heavy throat voice, were all in contrast; in other words, it was pure Chinese, but with a foreign flavor; a clear female voice, but mixed with a man's departing tone. While greeting the hostel receptionists, he intentionally or unintentionally showed his teeth to Yaoqun and nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>As soon as this half-male half-female, half-Chinese half-Western hybrid entered the door, the two receptionists seemed to have received mobilization orders, one rushing to run inside first, and one accompanying the guy while talking and walking inside. Qun took advantage of this gap and hurried out of the gate. She prepared to make a secret sign first, and then admire the rare sight; her sense of responsibility surpassed her curiosity.</p>
