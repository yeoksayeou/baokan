<h3>政院籌設臨時委會執行中美救濟協定分配物資將由民合辦</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕行政院副院畏王雲五，七日語記者：政院將成立一臨時委會，負責與美聯繫，主管執行中美救濟協定事宜，此項機構現正由渠指導設置，短期內即可實現，其任務以規劃爲主，至救濟物資之分配，則將由政府機關及民間慈善團體合力爲之，以爭取效率。此外，出售救濟物資價款之一部，亦將撥用發展民間慈善救濟事業，俾求其普遍。王氏設實中美救濟協定第二條丙款所稱，中國爲與美代表聯繫實施救濟計劃而指派之高級官員，將由一政院不管部之政委出任，然究係何人，則則則密不肯宜。據記者獲悉：以曾任戰時生產局副局長之彭學沛與西南企業家繆嘉銘兩氏最爲可能。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕副國務鄕洛維特答稱：得讀魏德邁報吿者，僅以少數政府要員爲限。國務卿馬歇爾亦向記者宣稱：余認爲發表該項報吿書，較諸發表余與杜魯門總統之私人談話並無更大必要。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓七日電〕美參議院戰爭調査委員會主席白魯斯特七日稱：渠以爲參院外交委員會一定將「要求」閱讀魏德邁氏對中國之秘密報吿，蓋「中國情形至少與歐洲同樣重要」，渠稱：報告秘不宣布之理由，可能爲對中國政府及局勢頗多批評，「然吾人有何權利譴責政府之貪汚？美國政府中亦有大批貪汚份子。」美參院軍會委員咸爾遜指斥國務院拒絕供給魏德邁報吿一事，並稱：國會對有關將來需要撥款之事，應先明瞭全部之事實，「國務院貿然藏起消息，不使美國人民及其立法機構明瞭，吾人又有何面目責備其他國家內之鐵慕」？</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓六日電〕華盛頓郵報因馬歇爾昨於記者會時，未闡明美對華政策及國務院對其他世界問題之態度，本日曾著文予以猛烈抨擎。</p>
<p>〔中央社曼谷六日合衆常〕據悉：美已同意購買價値五百萬美元之　米，以救濟中國，此批食米，可於兩個月內購齊。又遏亦已同意於十二月中旬以暹米二萬噸售與中國。</p>
<h3>王外長評美蘇關係　强調埃北重要　西沙羣島問題法作有條件讓步</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕王外長七日晨出席參政會駐委會，報吿外交槪况，略分五點：　出席聯大之經過，　否決權問題，　對日和約問題，　中·美關係，　朝鮮問題。王氏論中·美關係稱：美朝野人士目前漸趨好轉，美議員范登堡主張援歐計劃中應包括援華，足以說明美援華態度之轉變。王氏認爲，在十七日美國會臨時會議中，將有較好之表現。王氏述及自美返國經日本與麥帥晤見後之印象時表示，對麥帥之管制日本政策，經實地視察後，已鵝進一步之瞭解。王氏報告畢，參政員尹述賢·鄭揆一等均提出詢問，有人詢以菲報所戲菲對琉球羣島之意見，我政府對此有何表示？王氏答稱：此僅見報載，並未見菲政府表示態度，我外部曾令駐菲公使詢問，菲外部否認曾表示意見。有人詢以接收旅大事，王氏稱：正由外部交涉中。</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京七日電〕可靠方面悉；外交部長王世杰七日晨在參政會駐會委員會中報吿稱：唯有馬歇爾計劃在歐洲之成功，始能逼令蘇聯改變其政策，各參政員不應對美國援助一事過份熟心，而忽視東北之僵局。東北局面「可能較美國之財政經濟援助更為重要」，美國正擬聯合舉世興論，逼令蘇聯改變政策，然至今並無改變之跡象。蘇聯擬聯合歐洲之共產勢力，以擊敗馬歇爾計劃，美國特別國會召開後，對此計劃當能通過。馬歇爾計劃是否能排除困難，完成目的，頗難斷言。然此計劃之成功，將逼使蘇聯修正國際政治上之態度。王氏對魏使報吿及美援談判略而不提，惟稱美國與論對中國問題已有進一步之瞭解，觀諸范登堡之演辭可見一般（未證實之消息稱：王氏曾預料美國援華一事兩月內可吿澄淸）。中國目前亟需援助，「然目光放遠，吾人發現較美援更重耍之問題」，即東北問題，除非問題解決，中國及遠東將無和平可言。在華盛頓時，渠曾與杜魯門及馬歡爾長談此事，渠告二人稱：中國對日作戰，與蘇聯締約，企圖與蘇聯合作，以政治方式解決中共問題，所以然者，蓋有一唯一之目的，厥爲解決東北僵局。中國雖努力不輟，「結果大爲失望」，希望英·法·美·蘇在四外長會議中討論對德和約時，能有合作及相互讓步之精神。如此精神無從發現，若干國家可能單獨締結和約，王氏亦曾討論對日和約，朝鮮問題，日本內政及麥帥方針等事，與向報界發表者相同。</p>
<p>〔又電〕外交部七日晨向參政會駐會委員會書面報吿稱：關於西沙羣島，法國已作若干有條件之讓步，惟未說明讓步之性質。此間法大使館稱：對西沙羣島案有新發展事並無消息。戰後中·法均宣布西沙羣島爲其領土，中國軍隊在數島嶼登陸，法軍則佔據另一島，法國建議由國際仲裁解決此事，遭中國之拒，遂成縣案。</p>
<h3>參駐會例會通過六項要案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕參政會駐委會，七日晨舉行例會，江庸主席，王外長報吿後，討論提案，其原擬提出討論之召開第四屆第五次大會案，未經提出。茲誌各案如次：　范予遂等四人提請政府對本會現任參政員競選立委監委者，除其自願放棄競選者外，應本選賢與能之原則，予以優先提名候選人案，決議送政府迅速辦理。　蔡芷生等提請政府令飭四聯總處，公布生產合作農業等貸款數月及對象，以釋羣疑案，通過。　蔡芷生等提請政院令飭社會部，會同有關機關迅速救濟首都難民案，通過。　王普涵等提請政府速撥鉅款，救濟陝西難民案，通過。　姚廷芳等提請搶救罹難人民，擴大冬令救濟案，通過。　尹述賢等提，擬請政府迅即撥款辦理伊克昭盟救濟案，通過。</p>
<h3>大選不致再延再延期政黨候選人可補行公吿</h3>
<p>國民黨名單中發現選委已被剔除</p>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕據機威方面解釋：大選投票日期在法理方面，決不因政黨候選人之稍緩公布而再吿展期，蓋依據大選程序之候選人公吿，總選所及各省市均已於六日昭辦。至尙待公告之政黨候選人依法可補行公吿，而非必於投票前十五天公告也。〔本報南京七日電〕國代候選人政黨提名名單，七日尙未能提出。國民黨部份之手續，選總已辦理完竣，現正俟民靑兩黨之名單送到，即行公吿。民社黨之名單，七日經徐傳霖·蔣勻田，榻浚明赴滬召開該黨中常會後，七日復携商決之書面意見抵京，晨八時許交吳鐵城。民社黨人士表示，該黨提出原名單時，曾提出備忘錄一件，說明如有變更必須先與該黨商妥。現未經洽商，即將名單紊亂，在兩黨合作精神上，不無遺憾。某氏並强調，如對大選有所延悮，應由國民黨負全責，惟據最後消息，民靑兩黨名單，可能於八日提出。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京七日電〕民社黨徐傳霖，蔣勻田等，今晨自滬返京。吳鐵城秘書長下午訪徐氏，徐曾將民社黨前所提之國代候選人名單交還並附張君勱函一件。據悉，民社黨方面不能同意國民黨對於該黨候選人之安排者，爲人選與地區之分配問題，並非名額問題。該黨認爲其所提名單中，有重要份子七十餘人，未被列爲候選人，而該黨認爲不重要之四十餘人，則已被列入。至於名額問題，國民黨方面現雖不予安排所答應之人數，但聲明在若千緩靖區中已保留若干名額，故民社黨對此並無異議。陳立夫亦於今午訪靑年黨余家菊商談。現民靑兩黨均已將名單重交國民黨請予考慮。國民黨中央選舉指導委會之各審査小組召集人會報，於今晚八時半召開會議，討論民靑兩黨所提出之問題。</p>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕確悉，國民黨所提國民黨黨員及社會賢達之國代候選人名單，其中有廿八名係現任各級選舉機關委員，監督或職員，依照國代選罷法施行條例第廿八條之規定，應受限制。選總於核校後，已予剔除，並函請國民黨補提。</p>

<p>〔又電〕中·義爲解決由戰爭所起之損害賠償問題及中·義關於處理在華義國若干官員及義僑產業兩項換文，經立法院於七日晨例會通過，完成立法程序，該項換文係由我駐義大使于焌吉·與義外長史佛卓互換者，前經外部呈報政院會議通過，轉呈國府交立法院完成立法程序，再行備案公布。立院奉批後，即交由外交委員會審査，外部指派代表陳雄飛列席說明，其損害賠償部份，我所要求者，義方完全接受，義在華公私產業部份，義方使領用途之官產發還，其他兵營等由義方放棄，當經擬具審査意見，今日提出例會時，無甚討論，即予通過。（下接二版一欄）</p>

<h3>四强會議能打開歐洲僵局嗎？</h3>
<p>英美法蘇四國外長定於本月廿六日在倫敦開幕，　續商討對德奧和約，俾歐洲早日恢復和平狀態；四國外長爲便利工作進行起見，乃派代表先在倫敦，舉行四國外長代表會議。據聯合社的報道，四國外長代表自本月六日起，已在悲觀的空氣中開始其艱難的工作，俾對德奧兩國的前途，覓獲四國協議；惟因四强的意見大相逕庭，不啻南轅北轍，故一般政論家對於此次四國外長代表會議，均認爲未必能打關目前歐洲的僵局。但觀於歐洲今日的情勢，自新共產國際出現以來，歐洲的分裂，益見　骨；兩大陣營的對峙，日趨嚴重：如不設法補救，挽狂瀾於未倒，則歐洲的前途殊可悲觀，四國外長不論爲本身利益計，抑或爲歐洲各國的福利計，均有在此際會商，設法挽救歐洲危機的必要。因此世界各國對於這次四國外長代表會議，咸極重視，且認爲此乃四國外長能否打開歐洲僵局的一大關鍵。</p>
<p>在四國外長代表行抵倫敦之前，國際上也曾一度盛傳殊可樂觀的消息。據合衆社三日柏林電稱：此間英美蘇三國消息靈通人士，對於未來四國外長會議之前途，已由悲觀變爲樂觀，而認爲將來會議結果，至少必能獲得局部的成就；並指出若干樂觀的因素：　蘇聯報界攻擊英美已趨緩和；　蘇聯將讓步以避免加深東西集團的鴻溝；　蘇聯外交將有轉變，人事亦將有更動；　蘇聯在目前不能作戰，且亦不願作戰。因此認爲四國外長對於德奧問題有成立協議的可能，這種樂觀的論調，當爲我們渴望世界和平的人士所樂聞，且願其能獲得實現；但是客觀的事實，尤其是美蘇兩國間刻正從事於「冷酷的戰爭」，雙方尙無大家洗手的跡象，仍使我們不能樂觀過早。</p>
<p>緣在德國投降之後，歐洲的戰爭即吿終了，迄今日二年又三月，但尙未恢復和平狀態，而戰後的問題，又層出不窮，都沒有獲得適當的解決，以致歐洲陷於優周。列强外交家雖竭智盡能，迭次召開國際會議，企圖成立協議；但是始終沒有成功。我們硏究其癥結所在，很明顯的，德奧問題是今日歐洲問題的核心，這個主要的問題，若不能解決，則其他問題就沒有辦法。今年三月中旬，四國外長在莫斯科開會，就想商訂對德奧和約的原則，可是討論了四十五天，徒費外交家的唇舌，可以說一無所得，最後始通過二項決議：　設立四强委員於五月十二日在維也納舉行第一次會議，討論四强對於德奧和約意見不同之點；　下次四國外長會議定於十一月間在倫敦舉行，　續討論使英美與蘇聯意見紛歧的主要問題，例如解除德國軍備，人口移動交換以及德國經濟統一等問題。四國外長敷衍了事，於是莫斯科會議乃吿閉幕。迨至今年五月中旬，四强委員會雖如期舉行，但也沒有獲得具體結果，因此世人的視綫乃轉移到九日中旬的聯合國大會，可是我們在成功湖，只聽到美蘇代表的舌戰，只看到美蘇兩國的外交戰；又因爲否決權的問題，美國提出設立五十七國常務委員會的建議，使第二屆聯合國大會陷於僵局。固時歐洲九國的共產黨的代表，在華沙秘密開會，發表宣言，成立新共產國際，公然揭起反帝的旗幟，企圖破壊馬歇爾援歐計劃的實施。以是歐洲局勢頓時改觀，並引起兩種劇烈的反響，一方面是美國的加緊進行援歐計劃的實施；另一方面是西歐英法義三國政治的右傾，英法市議會選舉的結果，就是一個有力的說明，東西兩大陣營間的鴻溝，愈演愈深，實在足以加深歐洲的危機，擴大美蘇間的裂痕，匈京布達佩斯城曾一度盛傳美國向蘇聯宣戰的謠言，足見歐人神經的脆弱，再也經不起什麼神經戰了。而蘇聯偏偏不願停止其所謂神經戰，實在是戰後世界的一大悲劇。</p>
<p>蘇聯代表維辛斯基在聯合國大會席上，動輒以「戰爭販于」的帽子，加在美國政治外交家的頭上，固已足够刺激世人的神經；但是蘇聯外長莫洛托夫於蘇聯革命三十週年紀念日發表演說，竟謂原子秘密已不復存在，並指出美國以軍事基地包圍蘇聯，懷有侵略的目的。更是蘇聯向美國發動神經戰的攻勢？不僅足以擾亂國際上的和平空氣，而且足以阻撓四國外長代表會議的進行，我們終認爲莫洛托夫在四國外長會議開幕的前夕，發表這種富有刺激性言論，未免不合時宜，足使世人再度失去對於四國外長會議的信心與希望，據聯合社六日倫敦消息，美國業已擬就方案，一俟四國外長會議陷於僵局，即可提出；聞其內容，美國將與蘇軍佔領區以外之德國，單獨媾和。我們假定，未來的演變，果眞走到這種地步，歐洲的分裂，就無法挽救了。</p>
<p>惟在另一方面，愛好和平，是今日世人的普遍心理，不分國籍，種族，男女，老幼，是沒有不渴望和平的。這是人類的良知，也是戰後維持和平唯一的力量足以克服任何黑喑的勢力；我們對此，實具有絕大的信心；只要人人有此良知，人人有此自覺，國際的逆流固然可怕，但亦不難扭轉乾坤，所以我們對於美國國務卿馬歇爾提早四天，前往倫敦，出席外長會議，爲歐洲的和平作最大的努力，仍抱着無限的希望。馬帥五日答記者問話稱：「當戰爭正在進行之際，余自不能表示悲觀。」實在是耐人尋味的，馬帥的豪語，也是我們愛好和平者的唯一安慰。</p>
<h3>中義換文了解事項</h3>

<p>爲求上述要求之全部解決，義大利政府承担償付中國政府：甲，義幣一萬萬里拉，乙，另美金一萬八千四百九十八圓一角六分。</p>
<p>中義關於處理在華義國若干官員及義僑產業換文中說明，中義雙方已獲致下下下列列列了解：</p>

<p>中國政府同意在北平前使館界內，前義火利火使館房屋所在之該部份劃與義火利政府之土地，義大利政府當爲公務上之目的，得子使用。</p>
<p>中國政府對義大利國民關於其在中國所持有之　權，將給予現在或將來所給予一同盟國戚中立國國民之待遇。</p>
<h3>國代立委選舉　補充條例通過</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕關係綏靖區選舉之「國代。立委選擧補充條例」，經立院兩次討論，並經數度審査後，業經七日立院例會通過此案係國務會議所交議，立院第三三七次大會討論時，會中對下列兩點一致贊成：　每一地區或依行政區域組織之團體全部不能辦理選舉時，得在鄰近區域或指定處所登記選民，依法選舉，　每一地區或依行政區域組織之團體局部不能辦理選舉時，即在能辦理之地區內，由該地區主管選舉機關，就不能辦理部份，依　項辦法，進行選舉，惟會中對於選區全部收復後，是否應依照選舉法重行辦理選舉一節，則頗有爭論，經憲法法規委會審査，決在第五條中規定：每一地區或依行政區域組織之團體，至全部能依法辦理選舉時，應依各該選舉罷免法之規定，辦理普選，其辦理選舉日期，由國民政府以命令定之。</p>
<p>前項規定於局部未能辦理選舉之範圍，其區域未達三分之一以上，或區械已達三分之一以上，而人口數額未達三分之一以上者不適用之。</p>
<p>憲法法規委會召集委會劉克　今日說明審査經過時，指出原案選舉日期本規定爲一年，現規定爲山國府以命令定之，此係針對現實之規定，本案略經討論，即照審査意見通過。</p>
<h3>遴選地方參議員　另制定補充法規</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕國府委員徐傳霖。曾琦等所提經國務會議原則通過之「修改各省市縣參議會及臨時參議會法規，用遴選方式遴選各黨人士共同參加案」，七日晨於立院例會提出討論時，引起一場激辯。最後決定，另行制定補充法規，現先由法制，自治法兩委會研究條文，再交十五日例會討論。</p>
<p>會中今日討諭此案時顯分兩種不同意見：劉通·陳　遠等對各省市參議會及臨參會增加遴選議員一點原則同意，惟認爲方式上有鄭重考慮必要，並指出：　若千參議會已由民選，今再加入遴選代表，無異開倒車。　大選即舉行，地方民意機關再加入一部份遴選代表，精神上互相矛盾。　議員代表人民，遴選議員代表何人？　施政方針雖有地方民意機構儘量由各黨各派人士參加之規定，然並非即爲「當然」參加。　地方參議員由中央指派，中外所無。僉認不應遷就事實，而開破壊法紀惡例。</p>
<p>民·靑兩黨立委王師曾，劉東岩·羅靜軒等則提出法律及政治理由，希望地方民意機構能予開放，以容納各黨各派人士參加，並舉制憲國大及國民參政會有遴選代表爲例。</p>
<p>孫兼院長指示：過去各地參議會成立，民靑兩黨未參加競選，現為補救計，故規定在「現已成立之省參議會尙未改選者，得由國府就現有參議員名額外，遴選原名額至多五分之三人土爲省參議員」，俾兩黨人士共同參加，惟至參議會正式成立時，兩黨可參加新選舉，遴選問題即不至發生，無庸於法律中規定。本條例僅用一次，爲不得已出此，下不為例，用兩次即不民主。</p>
<p>孫九鍊。黃右昌等提出修正意見，孫九鍊主張增列一款，黃右昌則主張另行制定單行補充法規，決議另行制定單行補充法規，先交法制，自治法委會硏討條文，再交十五日大會討論。</p>
<h3>增加滿族國代　表示民族平等</h3>
<p>〔本報南京七日電〕立院七日晨討論增加滿族國大代表名額時，孫兼院長對民族主義有極透澈之解釋，孫氏首指出中華民國爲一多民族國家，憲法曾一再提及各民族一律平等，無分軒輊，因之，吾人決不可再存歧視觀念。蘇聯主義作風與我雖小盡相同，但其開明之民族政策，實爲其建國最大成功，値得吾人效法。美國雖爲自由之邦，然其歧視黑人，實爲最大汚點，但近年以來美曾通過保護印第安人之法令多種，歧視情形亦兌减少。此次增加滿族國代名額案，提案人于右任，鄒魯，張　三元老，過去皆爲排滿健將，但彼等所欲推翻者，爲滿淸之專制，而非仇視滿族一，此案之提出，即表示彼等對各民族一視同仁。吾人爲國家前途，民主前途計，對各民族應一律平等·不宜有專制思想，若仍爲腐敗落伍思想所惑，新國家決難建立，滿籍立委廣錄亦再三呼籲，盼對擁有二千七百萬人之滿族能寄以同情。某國在赤塔組有「滿族解放委會」，居心叵測，　予注意。劉不同亦謂，某國擬利用溥儀，拉攏滿胞，不可忽視。董其政，柳克述，趙逎傳　對增加滿族代表原則同意，惟不主張於憲法表明滿族，蓋憲法上對其他民族並不特別表明，決議國代選罷法第四條條文修正各民族在邊疆地區選出者由原有之十七名增爲卅四名，並於分配表中規定，由滿族國民選出十七名，其巾一人爲婦女代表。</p>
<h3>華南僑匯逃港　上月數逾千億</h3>

<p>莫洛托夫於述及外交政第時聲稱：和平的一切眞正友人，此固任何國家之大多數人民，可以確信蘇聯之將始終維議世界和平的利益。蘇聯始終主張國際合作之普遍發展。史達林同志與美國著名政治家史泰遜君晤談時，即會表示美蘇兩國當然可以互相合作。美蘇茍能合作，則意見縱有距離，亦屬克碍。美蘇之經濟制度確屬不同，但旣能在戰時合作，則在承平時代何以不能。茍無合作誠意，則經濟制度縱使相似，國家及人民仍不免互相作戰。蘇聯近對美國之各種計劃若杜魯門主義馬歇爾方案等，傳出之聲響已經不少，他人驟聞美國有如許之援歐援華等等計劃，必以爲其國內之問題必早已解決，故祗須整理他國事務，迫他人接受其政策，甚至代他人組織政府。其實事實並不盡然。美國常在與英國勾結下，侵佔全球各處之海空軍新基地，甚至對整批的國家，尤其是接近蘇聯之國，進行其類似的日標。美帝國主義者此等壓力，豈有不被任何人由訴者。戰時所設之英美聯合參謀部迄尙保存於華盛頓，亦決非爲愛好和平之目的而爲以侵略的姿態脅迫他國。</p>
<p>英美之統治階級今正領導企圖鞏固炎本主義完成統治他人者之「派，蘇聯之政策則相對的原則爲基礎，即尊重大小各國主權，不干涉他國內務。</p>
<h3>英美奴役歐洲蘇聯不能容忍</h3>
<p>莫洛托夫繼乃述及德國問題稱，英美於戰後苟能格運一切民主原則，及雅爾達波茨坦會議中關於德國問題之原則，則蘇美英之合作，至今日當已能產生良妊之結果，不幸英美不此之爲，竟單獨使英美已成爲共同治理之區域。而已無德國國家之存在，英美且復信賴前支持希特勒之德國資本家，利用其魯爾工業基地，以威脅不願奴役之諸國而達到統治歐洲之自的，然此等冒險家的計劃，當然將遭歐洲民主國之反對。就德國問題觀，可知英美今日所取之原則，乃帝國主義之原則，與蘇聯所據之民主原則已完全脫離。在現狀下需要歡洲及歐州以外之一切反帝國主義及民主勢力團結，以反抗帝國主義者之經濟奴役政策。</p>
<p>我官方認爲　外交神經戰</p>
<p>〔合衆社南京七日電〕此間官方相信，蘇聯外長莫洛托夫之演說，僅係另一次美蘇間之神經戰。據合衆社綜合此間官方之反饗，大致懐疑莫氏之原子彈演說，乃蘇聯外交政策將有新發展之表示。據稱，目前原子彈之「大部份秘密」，已成爲普通當識。彼等指出蘇聯會　次暗示原子彈智識非美國所獨有，然問題厥爲不斷研究及複雜之生產技術，而並不在乎發現其秘密。關於莫氏指責美國以軍事基地包閣蘇聯，目的在侵略蘇聯一事，此間官員稱，當前德國希　造成德國為戰爭國家時，亦常表示同樣論調，此乃若干國家利用此點從事與其他國家作戰之一貫老調。</p>
<p>蘇擁有秘密　美表示懐疑</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓六日電〕美政府地位甚高之專家，對於莫洛托夫所稱原子彈已無秘密之說，雖不表示懐疑或不信任，但指出獲悉原子彈秘密與製造原子彈之間，尙有極大之距離，包括鉅額金錢人力物力之消耗等。美官方對莫氏之言尙無評論。聯合國代表對莫氏之言，甚感興趣，但亦表示懐疑。某一熟悉蘇聯情形之歐洲代表稱，莫洛托夫之言亳不驚人，人人均知蘇科學家之原子分解學織，不在任何他人之下，但整個問題乃爲蘇聯是否有製造重要數量的原子彈之工業能力與製造方法耳。</p>
<p>外長會前夕　攻勢之先聲</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕莫洛托夫之演辭，就其中之要點而論，僅爲申述蘇聯共黨秘書長日丹諾夫於共產倩報局成立時所發表之主義。蘇聯之戰後美國經濟危機不能避免之理論，並不新穎，但莫洛托夫却特別重申蘇聯宮方的新學說，即美國之經濟危機已迫在　　，而美國帝國主義乃美國國內困難之直接結果，政治觀察家已在詳細研究莫洛托夫之演辭，俾得自其中探知蘇聯在倫敦外長會中所將採取之政策。莫氏曾日，「英美關於德國問題之原則，係以帝國主義爲據，而蘇聯則以民主爲根據」。可見在倫敦外長會中，莫洛托夫必全力攻擊英美合併區這發展，斥為企圖分裂總國建立反共之前哨站。</p>
<h3>陶格拉斯　今日返國</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫數七日廣播：美駐英大使陶格拉斯將於明日返華盛頓，與政府要員舉行會議，擬在美逗留十日，據陶氏稱：渠返國任務，係協助杜魯門總統尙國會提出緊急援歐計劃。</p>
<h3>對美總統緊急援歐計劃　國會願迅採行動　擬要求馬歇爾出席解釋</h3>
<p>〔美國新聞處華盛頓六日電〕參院外交委員會主席范登堡與衆院對外援助委員會副主席罕德本日表示，國會對歐臨時救濟計劃，將採取迅速行動。范登堡表示，國會將先討諭緊急救濟計劃，然後再硏究如何協助歐洲畏期復興之計劃。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電）衆院對外援助委會今日決定提出建議，主張於必要時由進出口銀行及貨物信託公司對法義兩國作臨時資助，至明年三月卅一日爲止。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓六日電〕共和黨控制之國會對於援歐事宜現準備與政府爲難，一方面要求發表全部事實，一方面指責社魯門政府處理對外救濟之無能。參衆兩院外交委會下星期一開會審査臨時援歐方案時，並將要求國務卿馬歐爾出席解釋。由現狀觀之，杜魯門召集國會於本丹十七日舉行特別會議時雖曾謂臨時援歐方案須儘先討論，但其通過難免曠日持久。據衆院議長馬丁稱，共和黨對於政府計劃，不能僅爲橡皮圖章。</p>
<h3>蘇聯慶祝十月革命　紅塲舉行盛大閱兵　布爾加寗元帥勗勉將士</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科七日電〕今日爲蘇聯十月革命三十週年紀念，紅塲舉行盛大閱兵典禮，由軍令部長布爾加寗元帥騎馬檢閱。布爾加寗向部隊致辭稱，資本主義者已在準備新的帝國主義戰爭，蘇聯仍繼續其和平與安全之奮鬥，蘇聯之政策獲得前進人士之普遍支持，和平乃由我人民及光榮的蘇聯軍力所保護。蘇軍深知其責任之重大，在史達林元師領導之下，繼續奮進以完成其責任。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦七日廣播：莫斯科訊，蘇聯十月革命三十週紀念日天氣陰寒潮濕，整個空氣，充滿對美國之厭棄與　視。美駐蘇大使史密斯未出席紀念會，渠雖被邀，但以天氣寒冷潮濕爲詞，婉予辭謝。美國駐蘇軍事代表亦未到塲。可注意者，史達林並未蒞臨，渠或仍在某處度假中。</p>

<p>〔中央社檀香山六日合衆〕整編太平洋艦隊海軍陸戰隊使成靈活之作戰單位，以應付原子戰爭之工作，茲已完成。美海軍陸戰隊副司令謝勃德少將稱，革命性之整編，可建立有高度彈性力之攻擊部隊，以迅雷不及掩耳之行動，奪取敵國進行原子彈攻擊之據點。</p>

<h3>四外長代表討論德和約　兩項問題列議程　賠償問題暫不提付討論</h3>
<p>〔路這社倫敦六日電〕四强外長代表在此開始討論德國和約問題時，蘇聯代表史米諾夫反對將聯合國國民在德財產有被移作戰利品或賠償品者得獲取補償之問題列人議程。聲言外長會議並未決定將此事交代表會議討論，結果議決延期討論是否應在本屆代表會中討論此一問題。</p>
<p>本屆會議議程所列各項，爲　準備對德和約之程序；　德國臨時政府之方式及範圍。會援發表之公報宣布今日會議中成立之其他程序上的決議，有　主席由四國代表團於每開四次會議輪流担任，次序爲英蘇美法；　記者不得入塲；　任何代表在原則上得提出不論已否討論之問題，惟須經其他三代表同意，始能將該問題交付討論。據宣布，貝文外相今日曾電其他三强外長，建議討論德國問題之代表，除已交彼等討論之問題外，並應在本屆會議中設法解決將由十一月廿五日外長會討論之問題。代表茍不能就一個問題成立協定，即進行討論下一問題，以免消耗時間。法代表哈杜安即席表示同意貝文此項建議，惟蘇美代表則謂尙未奉令，未便遽即接受。又週五爲蘇聯國慶日，經史米諾夫提議，停止開會一天。</p>

<h3>日政局動盪　西尾末廣被控</h3>
<p>閣　討論林平馬事件</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京七日電〕日社會黨內部西尾平野兩派鬥爭問題，愈演愈烈，昨日又有社會黨黨員植草平八郞向東京地方檢察署控吿國務大臣西尾末廣，理由爲西尾曾在昭和十三年（一九二八年）之日本議會發表實成總動員法之演講，應適用整肅令予以免職。按西尾因發表該項演說被控，此係第二次，早在本年四月總選擧進行時，即曾有人在公職資格審査委員會控吿。</p>

<h3>法工潮澎湃</h3>

<h3>聯大政治委員會通過　設立小型大會案　蘇聯集團聲明拒不合作</h3>
<p>〔聯合社成功湖六日電〕聯大政委會今日以四十三票對六票，又六票棄權，通過美國所提設立「小型大會」一案，該案須待下週末由聯大全體會議最後表決。蘇代表維辛斯基稱，此案違反聯合國憲章，蘇聯不擬參加，菲律賓與澳洲等國代表當即駁稱，蘇聯本身行動即屬道反憲章，要求將此種抗議列入紀錄。維辛斯基答稱，每一代表團均有對一切決議表示意見之權。南波捷烏克蘭白俄羅斯亦作同樣聲明。</p>
<h3>藉口防範共產黨滋擾　日陰謀重建軍隊　幕後活動正積極進行中</h3>
<p>〔聯合社東京七日電〕據有資格方面今日告聯合社記者稱，日本欲重建軍隊以保障盟軍撤退後之國家安全。此項運動正在幕後繼續進行。</p>
<p>目下日本新憲法當然禁止組織任何軍隊，但至和約將成立時，此問題必更臻重要，國內何派能於最後獲得政權，屆時當可決定。各方皆預料佔領軍撤退後，形勢將益趨緊張，或由共產黨，勞工領袖及一班黨徒發生暴動。同時各方亦皆認爲日本易受亞洲大陸上蘇聯勢力之侵犯。麥帥已明白表示願意准許日本增強警力，但亦曾表示反對日本建軍之決心。據稱，日本對於外來攻擊之防禦，須由盟國保障，並可由美國太平洋基地之空軍擔保。至恢復軍隊運動，係在吉田內閣時開始，因恐懼蘇聯，及認為警察力量不足以制止國內共產黨或勞工領袖，而潛滋暗長。迨後總罷工之爆發，僅賴麥帥直接干涉，始得避免，擁護此主張者乃因之益多，惟是否已向盟軍總部提出正式請求，則不得而知。</p>

<h3>一片千紅萬紫　菊展今日揭幕　昨舉行預展各首長讚賞不絕</h3>
<p>本報特寫〕我們的民族習性，崇尙淸風亮節，要經得起困難的折磨，又必須意態悠閒。菊花在百卉凋零時，郤能耐霜怒放，正象徵着我們的民族性，所以最爲國人所讚賞。工務局園塲管理處，在這天高氣爽的秋天，羅致了名菊三萬餘盆，假復興公園舉行菊花展覧會，門艷爭妍，綺麗名貴，令人不得不嘆服蒔菊者技巧的驚人。這次菊花展覧會，分爲陳列與比賽兩區，名菊比賽區中，包括：懸崖菊，枝條長大的小菊，利用人工攀成各種懸崖姿態，非常富於畫意。盆栽菊，一株分三四朶花，名目繁多，有「醉春」，「丹鳳朝陽」，「晨曦」，「芙蓉春色」，「出水芙蓉」等等。獨本菊，一株僅鵝一幹，頂上開花一朶，非常名貴。立菊，全株特別高大，花朶數月也多，品種以衡園的最好，花朶以第四苗圃的最多，是一百二十七朶。</p>
<p>墨菊綠荷最難種植　一盆名貴的菊花，要菊體生長平衡，色澤調和鮮明，品種新穎稀少，莖華繁茂，且脚葉不脫，絕不是容易栽培的。這次展覽會中，比較最名貴的菊花，據聞是墨菊和綠荷，墨菊呈紫黑色，綠荷呈淡綠色，因品種稀少，亦最難種植。</p>
<p>此外，園塲管理處將黃漱霜。白荷。雪靑。雪蟹等各種菊花，佈置成菊亭，菊屛，菊橋，菊山，菊塔，和雙籠搶珠等，只見一片萬紫千紅，引人入勝。</p>
<p>昨大下午四時，園塲管理處先行招待各界舉行預展。吳市長，趙祖康局長夫人，司徒當登大使，和加拿大商務參贊都準時趕往，大家通聲　賞不絕。</p>
<p>澹泊高尚有裨世風　今年的菊花展覧會有如此美滿的成績，不得不歸功於園塲管理處處長徐天錫，園藝專家程世撫，和他的女兒禇到小姐，他們曾經默默地下過一番苦功，他們說：「目今世風日下，市民娛樂日趨低級化，藉此機會，使養成澹泊高尙的興趣。倘能移風易俗，多少有裨於社會敎化，那更是我們所企望的了。」</p>

<h3>十二年前箱屍案主犯王化一像一隻困獸陷入了虎阱</h3>
<p>〔本報北平五日航訊〕十二年前（民國廿五年〕一月最末的日子，那時正是春節剛遇，萬民騰鞦的時節。北平前門車站行李處，收到了兩隻漆鐵箱，一隻藍色的，一隻紫色的，過磅時分量嫌得非常沉重，辦事人員以爲是什麽貨物，要求打開檢騐，交運的旅客沒帶鑰匙，說是回家去取，結果一去不返，這兩隻預備運往　陽的沉重的漆鐵箱竟被它的主人棄之如敝屣，永遠沒有人來過問了。車站的辦事人員起了疑竇，打開箱子一着，那是什麽行李？嘿！竟是兩堆被支解了的血肉模糊的一個男屍，頭顱·胳膊·大腿，都被砍掉，用舊棉被包裹敷蓋着。</p>
<p>這慘絕人寰的箱屍案，轟動了當時的華北甚至全國，也忙然了北平治安當局，最後捕到了兇手但並不是主犯的李亮經，才知道死者張樹林，因爲和他的主人同時也是</p>
<p>他的情敵</p>
<p>的王化一同戀了王家的奶媽柳王氏（通稱柳媽），王化一妬火燒中，後來邀同內兄郗倉有，買通廚子李亮經，於廿五年一月廿七日夜裏把張樹林殺死，四天以後預備把它運往潘陽拋棄滅跡。案發後，兇手李亮經被捕判處死刑，但是唆使行兇的主犯王化一和另一幫兇郗倉有郤鴻飛冥冥，存亡莫卜，平津人士在十二年來動亂，艱辛的歲月裏，早巳把這件別人的個人恩怨忘得乾乾凈凈了。</p>
<p>今年十月十八日，東四七條四十號，偵緝隊捕獲了一個烟毒犯王宗堯，王在偵緝隊已供認吸毒不諱，送到警察局後，王又推翻前供，警局無法，發回偵緝隊再審。就在這時，王的侄女婿周某，在外替他多方奔走，於某種傷合時，曾涉透露王宗堯就是王化，恰巧有新聞記者在旁，翌日便在報上用大字標題披露。另方面，警局所發交再審的偵緝八分隊，正是十二年前原辦箱屍案的偵緝隊，於是找出原卷，嚴加審訊，才把這位</p>
<p>隱姓埋名</p>
<p>遠走天涯的「活死人」，發掘出來了。</p>
<p>在偵緝隊工作十五年的老隊員認出了他是十二年前箱屍案的主兇，又經熟習王犯的劉劉氏辨識出王宗堯就是王化一後，王宗堯對於他原名王化一這件事，已無法抵賴了。他今年已六十二歲，身體魁梧，面色蒼白，兩員兇惡，滿面鬍鬚，在偵緝隊裏，着藍大衣，黃皮鞋，毛絨褲，狀極狼狽，活像一隻跌在虎阱裏的困獸。</p>
<p>十二年是一段悠長的歲月，人事渝桑，也變化得令人不可捉摟，原先跑掉據走天涯的王化一，十二年後的今日，又跑回原地</p>
<p>戴上鐐銬</p>
<p>而事發後被補的兇手李亮經，於十年鐵窗之後却已恢復了自由。據高律師稱：十年監獄生活，已使李亮經大爲改變，從前李不大通文字，因打了十年官司，李之文字已淸通可誦，字跡寫得亦好，惟力氣已變弱得多，目因殺人案關係已不易謀得職業，雖有廚司手藝亦只得改行。據稱，李已返肅寗原雜，最近一年來未見其蹤跡。</p>

<h3>國行經濟研究處分析　存款通貨流通速度　游資南移與僑滙關係已不甚密切</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於最近通貨流通速度及資金南移之趨勢，記者昨特趨訪中央銀行經濟研究處負責人，承詳加解析如次：</p>
<p>本年今年所開始計算之上海商業行莊存款通貨流通速度，現已計算至六月，其各月之流通速度如次：一月一九·七七，二月二四·六三，三月二一·三二，四月二二·五七，五月三三·九六，六月三八·〇五。七月份正在計算中，大概將較六月份為尤高，此項流通速度係存款通貨（活期存款）之流通速度，幷菲法幣（鈔券）之流通速度。外間每誤稱為法幣之流通速度，殊不合事實。　之實際，我人雖無法計算鈔券之流通速度，但佔計必遠較存款通貨（亦可說是信用）的流通速度為低無疑。其次比項存款通貨的流通速度，僅包含商業行莊之存款通貨，而國家行局的存款通貨不在內，由於國家行局向不允許票據抵用，故國家行局存款通貨之流通速度，必遠較商業行莊者為低。再者在其他城市，本處尙未開始此項工作，但可斷言其他城市存款通貨之流通速度，必較本市為低。蓋不但本市為全國之最大投機市塲，亦因其他城市很少抵用制度也。</p>
<p>國內游資之移動，大體由於投機及走私。最近游資之南移與僑匯的關係，已不甚密切。大體言之，游資仍係向上海集中，蓋投機與囤積之用武地在上海也。至於近時游資之流，向華南者，則與通天證不無關係。</p>
<h3>國行稽核處發表　行莊存款統計</h3>
<p>國行稽核處，七日發表九月份上海商業行莊資產總額及存放款統計如下：　華商銀行，資產總額計二，五六〇，八二八，一二九，九〇二·三二元，存款總額一，〇六一，五八〇，二〇八，九〇九·六七元，放款總額八五七，三一六，六九七，一一八·四五元。</p>

<h3>華股多空掙扎　臨收銳勢微挫</h3>
<p>華股昨多方若紗花帮加碼，金業帮廣帮買胃仍健，證券大戶空頭有補，國行差出甚多，業外刺激復起，上漲甚多，但新空亦有抵抗，高後頗多掙扎，臨收漸形不定</p>
<p>晨開時，在前者見高，在後者反低，因英匯牌價掛低，而美匯未更也。開後永紗自二八四元及二九一元起，曾低至即交二七九元，遞交二八七元，漸有吸納，塲外息價開低至一角三分半及一角八，外股見俏，塲外喊價又高即交漲到二九一元及二九九元。此時美亞亦吿步昂，永紗再升至二九四元及三〇三元，臨收時漲到即交二九六元，遞交三〇四元高價。午收爲即交二九四元，遞交三〇二元。餘股除成交冷落之五和慘跌，內衣尙疲外，頗多以高檔結束。</p>

<h3>讀者諮詢法律質疑　舊禮敎束縛下的弱女子　掙脫覊絆追求光明</h3>
<p>編輯先生：我是一個被舊禮敎所束縛的女子，今年已經二十歲了。在我六歲時，祖母便爲我決定了終身，同郭姓締結了婚約。常時因爲年幼無知，自然沒有反對，十三年來的我與郭某，根本就毫無感情，就是他的面貌我也渺茫得很，同時他又於三十三年的冬天，從軍外出，在這三年的漫長時日中，他竟對我音訊杳然，由此看來，我在他的心中已是形消影匿了。</p>
<p>去年春天我在某校求學，同一位姓李的同學相識，我們在熱情的鼓舞下，感情隨着日子增長，一年餘來我們已躍入了白熱的愛河中，於是我向父親提出同郭姓解約的要求，不料父親以封建的口吻，斷然拒絕。在這舊禮敎封鎖的環境下，我成了一隻脆弱的羔羊，不知應以甚麽方法，來排解這困難的問題。素聞貴報為　途的指針，敬請予以一角，指示下面的幾個疑問，實不勝感激得很。　由祖母作主而未到法定年齡之婚約，是否有效？　我能否單獨登報否認此項婚約？　我如提出解約，他方可否提出賠償損失之要求？　如他方不表贊成，應如何處置？　若我未將此項婚約解除前可否與李某訂婚？　郭某為現役軍人在法律上優待軍人是否有其他問題？　如家長不表贊成應用何法處理？讀者何　芬上。</p>
<p>〔傳况　律師答〕　本人如已成年對於家長往日代訂之婚約得主張無效。　可。　對方無過失得要求賠價因此所受之損害。　他方不贊同可可可置不理。　可。　無。　不得强迫履行。</p>

<h3>德作家溫魯的怒火</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>溫魯（Fritz　Von　Unruh）是德國有名的戲劇家和抒情詩人。常納粹得勢的時候，他像托馬斯曼和別的現代德國作家一樣，逃亡在外。戰時他在法國，失去一切東西，連他的手稿在內。他被關在法國集中營裏，還是愛因斯坦和托馬斯曼　他向羅斯福總統請求，纔救他出來的，後來他就在一九四一年到了美國。在美國，他靠着他自己的回憶和「憤怒的反條頓民族」想像這「啓示錄時代的全景」。在他那奇怪而又巨大的長篇小稅的末尾，他只加上一個簡單的註釋。他說：「我用戲劇的散文寫下這時代的死的跳舞，像這樣做，我被隔離在最黑暗的幽僻地方，容易自己分析納粹主義所傳染給我的微菌。不但把當個顯示給別人看，也指出拔除的可能—這就是這作品的意識。」這作品名叫「還不曾結束」（The　End　Is　Not　Yet）。未出版前，已有許多譯者搶着要譯，也有不少出版家看到原原稿。引用作者的話，大家「對於這戲劇感興的史詩感到驚奇。」</p>
<p>托馬斯曼認爲溫魯是最近十餘年來德國最有天才的戲劇家，溫譽的抒情詩也是現代德國文學中最好的。顯然這樣深湛創造的作家，（他最近的作品究全是象徵的）可以產生非常動人的小說，描寫納粹摧殘文化的情形。再說，他那詩歌和戲劇的天才都是他强烈的個性和有力的自信的產物。他的祖上是普魯士富繞的地主，他的父親是東普魯士的總督，又是興登堡的朋友。像這樣一個人，在忍受十年遣戍逃亡的恥辱以後，在他的書籍被納粹燒掉，他被剝奪公民資格以後，不能寫他那史詩般的散文小說，他的心被怒火所燃燒，反對那使他國家滅亡，引起第二次戰爭的巨大集團。他只好把他的憤怒變成戲劇般的象徵主義，他那悲苦的記憶變成粘結的敍述。結果就是現在這一本書。其中所寫的瘋狂的人所造出的恐怖與腐敗機乎是不可想像的。</p>
<p>其中一景發生於巴黎的德國大使館，希特勒，戈培爾赫斯和不少的軍官都在塲，一個波蘭的猶太舞女娜迭芽（Nadia）被投在一個大猿的籠中。「非洲大猿用牠那巨大的手臂圍住了哪迭牙的臀部。她的驚呼消失在狂笑和高呼裏面。唾液流下赫斯（Hess）的下巴。他嚷道：「像法老的法律反對猶太人一樣，須要防止劣質滲雜在尊貴的埃及種族裏，因而墮落。把希伯來人趕出尼羅河。」希特勒跑到籠邊，「一點也不錯。我要替全世界你們這種人消毒！你這崛强的母猪，」娜迭芽的雙手無力地顫抖着，「天哪，天哪！你要淹死他們麽？親愛的，親愛的上帝，淹死他們吧。把他們淹到血的紅海裏，血的海裏，這些謀殺犯！」』這節幻想的語句是很簡單的。</p>
<p>同一晚上，另有一景，殺人的惡魔布契（Buch）在折磨之後，把一個波蘭的天主敎從舞女弄死。希特勒爲了瘋癲的自私想要使得死女復活。當一絲不掛的女屍放在希特勒脚前的時候，他向軍官萬特爾（Keitel）說：「「葛特爾，聽我說。我的肉體一直爬行到指尖！我的血液感到刺痛，好像螞蟻走到我的靜脈裏去！什麽？像我希特勒這樣的超人對着這樣柔弱的女屍，竟會如此，豈非是個笑話！」他換緊拳頭打在精神的鍵上，於是琴弦發出噹噹的聲音。「葛特爾！你是崇高的戰將，我嚴爾地問你，你相倍我能够使得這死去的舞女回生麽？」』起初這舞女是被請去跳舞的，希特勒與她在一起，剝去她的衣服，强迫她在他那書房的大玻璃地板上跳舞。結果自然到了瘋癲與邪僻的高潮。全書中希特勒及其部屬的瘋狂不只表現一次。希特勒的誇口與發狂幾乎使得讀者不相信，他的權力擴張到德國以至大部分的歐洲。溫魯所表現的這種動物似乎全是幻想，圍繞着他的人也似乎是瘋人院中的人。</p>
<p>溫魯所寫的也有一部分的價實，我們不妨把這本書當作寓言看。其中的人物都是象微，並非血與肉的人與女人。但象徵和寓全抓住了納粹的瘋狂和非人性。</p>
<h3>被扒小記</h3>
<p>— ·鶉衣小吏·</p>
<p>領到一奔爲數不大不小的稿費，就和妻一道出去買點布料，準備孩子們的冬衣；說起來也價慚愧，國家雖然勝利了，而我們這些身經大難的人，一且回到上海來，還是十年故我的鶉衣百結</p>
<p>在南京路的大公司裏兜了一趟，買了兩件衣料和兩套自認爲價廉物美的童裝，然後又一再籌劃之後買了一座機石牌的電鏡，才拖着疲倦的脚步和一顆滿足的心，走出新新公司來。</p>
<p>太陽這時已經斜斜地照射到馬路上，整整半天的好時光，也就這樣匆匆地消磨掉了；我開始覺得腹中有點飢餓，便提議到大三元去吃茶點。</p>
<p>我和妻一邊談着所買的東西，研究衣料的花色，而我最高興的是我們已經買了一座電鐘，從今以後，再不會有半夜裏寫稿休息的時候，去等待隣家時鐘吿訴我的時刻了；妻也爲我高興，因此，我就在內衣上抽出筆，在茶單後面畫出我準備縣掛電鐘的地方。</p>
<p>就這樣我們非常滿意地用完了茶點，為着過於興奮的綠故，我很粗心的把鋼筆插到西裝外面的小口袋上，狹着滿抱的東西，走出了大三元酒家。</p>
<p>在南京路上，我們仍然興高彩烈地談着，忽然看見有人圍着一根倒下來的電桿，我就和妻說：「看樣子一定又是軍車闖禍了——』。</p>
<p>這時，有一個三十多歲的市年人，用極流利的北平話接下去：「可不是軍車嗎，」他指着一間閂起鐵門的舖子說：「好大的勁兒，碰倒了電桿又衛上行人道，一直開到人家舖子裏去了……」</p>
<p>『沒有傷人嗎？」我問。</p>
<p>當然傷了啦……』他說着就匆匆地走了。</p>
<p>頓時我突然被一種警覺喚醒，連忙一摸，我的鋼筆早已不翼而飛了。</p>
<p>我非常懊喪地叫了一輛三輸車回到家中來，一枝筆，在我們文人就等於兵士的槍，被繳了械的士兵，已經喪失了固有的勇氣和戰鬥能力；我就是這樣一個荒唐的土兵。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>「那麼，究竟這一次的夜襲，是誰的主動呢」在我的幻想中這時候好像電影似的，映出了一些可怖的情景，間牒，反問牒，反反間牒，種種的複雜情節，交互組織，演出一個可怖可慘的故事，叫我一想到這故事的結局，就覺得不寒而慄。</p>
<p>「可以說是買沙夫，也可以說是我，也可說是由我們兩側人同時發起這一次的夜襲！」耀羣隨口這麽答覆我。</p>
<p>「那麽買沙夫的動機在那裏呢？」想到事情結局的可怕，所以我這麼問着耀羣</p>
<p>「她沒有明白的表示。可是……」耀羣很沉着地：「可是我很知道，她也是想乘着敵我兩軍互相衝突的時候，設法沘　　一方面去。據她說，她很願意見見他的老朋友，就是現在保衛南口的總司令</p>
<p>「他一個人混過去嗎？「我的疑慮又加深了一層。</p>
<p>「對了。」耀羣點；「起初計劃這次夜襲的時候，就是昨天下午，她很想邀着我們一路過去。我因為不願意她知道我往後的行動，所以沒有表示。她也隨隨便便的點了點頭，也不知道她爲什麽點這個頭。也許他今天下午，還要把這情提出來討誰，也未可知。」</p>
<p>我和耀羣在這裏彼此談着話的常口，小老虎有時坐在一邊靜聽；有時走動一下，在外面蹓　幾步，重又回來；想必是担任警備的意思。屋角，坐在草堆上的鼎元，早已睡熟了，不時發出鼾聲，大槪是困乏得厲害；所以我們說話的時候，聲音放得很低，恐怕把他驚醒了。</p>
<p>關於鼎元的問題，我本來預備提出來，和耀羣討論一下；看耀羣有什麽意見：是讓他就拿現在的這個姿態，在這裏混下去呢？還是預備把他帶回北平去，交托給W君，還是對他另有別的打算。至於我這方面，我很希望鼎元能够回到北平，在一個療院裏，或是城裏，或是西山，讓他多多休陽一些時。且等把身體的健康完全恢復過來，然後再設法送他到南邊，參加軍隊裏面的工程處，也好做一番事業。因爲我深深知道，像他這樣的人才，任何軍專集團，都有很大的需要。</p>
<p>耀羣見我低頭沉吟，知道我在思索，所以也暫時沉默。屋子裏除了鼎元的鼻息和偶然的鼾聲外，異常靜。就在這幾分鐘的沉靜之後，我剛想對耀羣提出鼎元的問題來，驀然瞧見小老虎，就地躍起，像一頭狸貓那樣敏捷輕巧；同時瞧着我和耀羣，伸出兩隻手，虛虛一按，神情十分緊張。</p>
<p>「什麼……？」我和耀羣都吃了一驚；我這「什麽事」三個字還不曾完全出口，小老虎楞起一雙大圓眼珠，把伸出的手，重又加重的對着我們虛按了一下。</p>

<h3>Provisional Committee to be Established by the Executive Yuan to Implement the Sino-American Relief Agreement and Distribute Materials Jointly by Government and Private Sectors</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 7th Dispatch] Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Yunwu, told reporters on the 7th that the Executive Yuan will establish a provisional committee to be responsible for liaising with the United States and to oversee the implementation of the Sino-American Relief Agreement. This organization is currently being established under his guidance and will be realized in the short term. Its main task is to plan, while the distribution of relief materials will be carried out jointly by government agencies and private charitable organizations to achieve efficiency. In addition, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of relief materials will also be allocated to develop private charitable relief undertakings to ensure their widespread reach. Mr. Wang stated that the senior official referred to in Article 2, Paragraph C of the Sino-American Relief Agreement, who is to be appointed by China to liaise with U.S. representatives to implement the relief plan, will be a political appointee from a ministry without portfolio of the Executive Yuan. However, he refused to disclose the person's identity. According to our sources, Peng Xuepei, former Deputy Director of the Wartime Production Board, and Miao Jiaming, a Southwest entrepreneur, are the most likely candidates.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 7th Dispatch] Deputy Secretary of State Lovett replied that only a small number of government officials have read the Wedemeyer Report. Secretary of State Marshall also told reporters: "I don't think there is any greater need to publish this report than to publish my private conversations with President Truman."</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 7th Dispatch] Senator Brewster, Chairman of the Senate War Investigating Committee, said on the 7th that he believed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would "demand" to read Wedemeyer's secret report on China, as "the situation in China is at least as important as that in Europe." He said that the reason for keeping the report secret may be that it contains a great deal of criticism of the Chinese government and situation, "but what right do we have to condemn the corruption of the government? There are also a large number of corrupt elements in the U.S. government." Senator Wilson, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized the State Department's refusal to provide the Wedemeyer Report, saying that Congress should first understand all the facts regarding future appropriations. "If the State Department rashly hides the news, preventing the American people and their legislative body from understanding, how can we blame the iron curtains in other countries?"</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th Dispatch] The Washington Post strongly criticized Marshall in today's article for failing to clarify U.S. policy toward China and the State Department's attitude toward other world problems at yesterday's press conference.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 6th Dispatch, Associated Press] It is reported that the United States has agreed to purchase rice worth $5 million to relieve China. This batch of rice can be purchased within two months. Furthermore, Thailand has also agreed to sell 20,000 tons of Siamese rice to China in mid-December.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Wang Comments on U.S.-Soviet Relations, Emphasizes Importance of Northeast China, France Makes Conditional Concessions on the Xisha Islands Issue</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 7th Dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang attended a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Senate on the morning of the 7th and reported on the general diplomatic situation, divided into five points: 1. The process of attending the United Nations General Assembly; 2. The veto issue; 3. The Japanese peace treaty issue; 4. Sino-American relations; 5. The Korean issue. Regarding Sino-American relations, Mr. Wang said that the attitude of people in the United States, both in and out of government, is gradually improving. U.S. Senator Vandenberg's advocacy that aid to China should be included in the European aid plan is sufficient to illustrate the change in the U.S. attitude toward aid to China. Mr. Wang believes that there will be a better performance at the U.S. congressional special session on the 17th. Mr. Wang stated that after returning from the United States and meeting with MacArthur in Japan, his impression of MacArthur's policy of governing Japan, after on-site inspection, has been further understood. After Mr. Wang's report, Senators Yin Shuxian and Zheng Kuiyi raised questions. Someone asked about the Philippines' opinion on the Ryukyu Islands as reported in the Philippine newspapers, and what the government's position is on this. Mr. Wang replied that this was only seen in the newspapers, and the Philippine government had not expressed its position. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had instructed the ambassador to the Philippines to inquire, and the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied having expressed any opinion. Someone asked about the issue of receiving Dalian and Lushun. Mr. Wang said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently handling the matter.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] Reliable sources have learned that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported at the Standing Committee of the Senate on the morning of the 7th that only the success of the Marshall Plan in Europe can force the Soviet Union to change its policy. Senators should not be overly concerned about American aid and neglect the stalemate in Northeast China. The situation in Northeast China "may be more important than American financial and economic assistance." The United States is planning to unite world opinion to force the Soviet Union to change its policy, but so far there is no sign of change. The Soviet Union intends to unite the communist forces in Europe to defeat the Marshall Plan. After the special session of the U.S. Congress convenes, this plan should be passed. It is difficult to say whether the Marshall Plan can overcome difficulties and achieve its goals. However, the success of this plan will force the Soviet Union to revise its attitude on international politics. Mr. Wang made no mention of the Wedemeyer Report or the U.S. aid negotiations, but only said that American public opinion has a further understanding of the China issue, as can be seen from Vandenberg's speech (unconfirmed news says that Mr. Wang predicted that U.S. aid to China would be clarified within two months). China is currently in urgent need of assistance, "but looking further ahead, we find that a problem more important than U.S. aid" is the Northeast issue. Unless the issue is resolved, there will be no peace in China and the Far East. In Washington, he had long talks with Truman and Marshall on this matter. He told them that China fought against Japan and signed a treaty with the Soviet Union, trying to cooperate with the Soviet Union to solve the Chinese Communist problem politically, for the sole purpose of resolving the stalemate in Northeast China. Although China has worked tirelessly, "the result is greatly disappointing." It is hoped that the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union can have a spirit of cooperation and mutual concession when discussing the German peace treaty at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. If such a spirit cannot be found, some countries may conclude a peace treaty separately. Mr. Wang also discussed the Japanese peace treaty, the Korean issue, Japanese internal affairs, and MacArthur's policy, which were the same as those published to the press.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported in writing to the Standing Committee of the Senate on the morning of the 7th that regarding the Xisha Islands, France has made some conditional concessions, but the nature of the concessions was not specified. The French Embassy here stated that there was no news about new developments in the Xisha Islands case. After the war, both China and France declared the Xisha Islands to be their territory. Chinese troops landed on several islands, while French troops occupied another island. France suggested that the matter be resolved by international arbitration, which was rejected by China, and the case became a pending issue.</p>
<h3>Standing Committee Meeting Passes Six Important Cases</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 7th Dispatch] The Standing Committee of the Senate held a regular meeting on the morning of the 7th, chaired by Jiang Yong. After Foreign Minister Wang's report, proposals were discussed. The proposal to convene the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fourth Senate, which was originally planned to be submitted for discussion, was not submitted. The cases are recorded as follows: 1. The proposal submitted by Fan Yushui and others requesting the government to give priority nomination to incumbent senators of the Senate who are running for the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan, except for those who voluntarily give up running, in accordance with the principle of selecting the virtuous and capable, was resolved to be sent to the government for prompt handling. 2. The proposal submitted by Cai Zhisheng and others requesting the government to order the Four Joint Offices to announce the number of production cooperation, agricultural, and other loans and the targets to dispel public doubts was passed. 3. The proposal submitted by Cai Zhisheng and others requesting the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Social Affairs to work with relevant agencies to quickly provide relief to refugees in the capital was passed. 4. The proposal submitted by Wang Puhan and others requesting the government to quickly allocate huge sums of money to provide relief to refugees in Shaanxi was passed. 5. The proposal submitted by Yao Tingfang and others requesting to rescue the people who died in the disaster and expand winter relief was passed. 6. The proposal submitted by Yin Shuxian and others, proposing to request the government to quickly allocate funds to handle the relief of the Ikezhao League, was passed.</p>
<h3>General Election Will Not Be Postponed Again, Party Candidates Can Be Supplementally Announced</h3>
<p>Names of Election Committee Members Found to Have Been Removed from Kuomintang List</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] According to explanations from authoritative sources, the date of the general election will definitely not be postponed again in terms of legal principles due to the slightly delayed announcement of party candidates, as the announcement of candidates in accordance with the general election procedure has been carried out by the General Election Office and various provinces and cities on the 6th. Party candidates who are yet to be announced can be supplementally announced according to law and are not necessarily required to be announced 15 days before the election. [Our Nanjing Bureau, 7th Dispatch] The list of party nominations for candidates for the National Assembly was not submitted on the 7th. The procedures for the Kuomintang part have been completed by the General Election Office, and it is now waiting for the lists of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party to be sent for announcement. The list of the Democratic Socialist Party was taken to Shanghai by Xu Chuanlin, Jiang Yuntian, and Ta Junming on the 7th to convene the Central Standing Committee of the party. On the 7th, they returned to Nanjing with written opinions discussed and decided, and handed them over to Wu Tiecheng at around 8 a.m. Democratic Socialist Party officials stated that when the party submitted the original list, it submitted a memorandum stating that any changes must be agreed upon with the party first. The disorganization of the list without consultation is regrettable in the spirit of cooperation between the two parties. Someone also emphasized that if there is any delay in the general election, the Kuomintang should be fully responsible. However, according to the latest news, the lists of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party may be submitted on the 8th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] Xu Chuanlin, Jiang Yuntian, and others from the Democratic Socialist Party returned to Beijing from Shanghai this morning. Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng visited Xu this afternoon, and Xu returned the list of candidates for the National Assembly previously submitted by the Democratic Socialist Party and attached a letter from Zhang Junmai. It is reported that the Democratic Socialist Party cannot agree with the Kuomintang's arrangements for the party's candidates due to the allocation of personnel and regions, not the number of seats. The party believes that more than 70 important members of its nominated list have not been listed as candidates, while more than 40 people whom the party considers unimportant have been included. As for the number of seats, although the Kuomintang does not currently arrange the promised number, it stated that it has reserved a number of seats in several buffer zones, so the Democratic Socialist Party has no objection to this. Chen Lifu also visited Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party this afternoon to discuss matters. The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party have now resubmitted the list to the Kuomintang for consideration. The meeting of the conveners of the various review groups of the Central Election Guidance Committee of the Kuomintang was held at 8:30 p.m. tonight to discuss the issues raised by the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 7th Dispatch] It is confirmed that among the list of National Assembly candidates nominated by the Kuomintang, including Kuomintang members and social notables, 28 are incumbent members, supervisors, or staff of election authorities at all levels, and are subject to restrictions in accordance with Article 28 of the Implementation Regulations of the National Assembly Election and Recall Law. After verification, the General Election Office has removed them and requested the Kuomintang to submit replacements.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Returns to Guangzhou, Zou Lin to be Appointed Secretary-General of Guangdong Provincial Government, Security Corps to be Expanded to Three to Four Regiments</h3>
<p>[Our Guangzhou Bureau, 7th Dispatch] Guangdong Provincial Chairman Song Ziwen returned to Guangzhou on the 7th via China National Aviation Corporation after a two-week trip to Nanjing to report on his work. Mrs. Song accompanied him. It is reported that Mr. Song's trip was extremely fruitful: 1. The personnel of the provincial government have been finalized. Zou Lin will serve as Secretary-General, Xu Liangtang as the Director of Civil Affairs, Hu Shanheng as the Director of Finance, and Yao Baoyou and Xie Wenlong will continue to serve as the heads of the Department of Education and the Department of Construction, respectively. 2. Regarding the issue of public order in Guangdong Province, the central government has agreed to expand the security corps to three to four regiments based on the financial resources of Guangdong Province. 3. The scope of foreign investment in Guangdong has been determined, based on the principle of not infringing on state-owned industries. 4. The provincial government may select Whampoa next year to implement the plan to build a large port in Whampoa.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Important Cases, Sino-Italian Compensation Issue Completed Legislative Process, Seventeen More Seats Added for Manchu National Assembly Representatives</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Bureau, 7th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan held its 33rd regular meeting on the morning of the 7th, chaired by Dean Sun. The meeting passed important cases: 1. The exchange of notes between China and Italy on resolving war reparations issues. 2. Supplementary regulations on the election of National Assembly representatives and members of the Legislative Yuan. 3. The case of adding 17 seats for Manchu National Assembly representatives. The case of amending the regulations on provincial, municipal, and county councils and provisional councils was resolved to enact separate supplementary laws, which will be submitted to the Legal System and Autonomous Law Committee for research and articles, and then submitted for discussion at the next regular meeting.

Hong Kong Government to Assist Our Anti-Smuggling, Ships Sailing Need to Obtain Examination Form First</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th Dispatch] In response to the request of our government, the Hong Kong government announced today that all ships sailing to ports in China should first obtain an examination form from the Marine Department. This small form will be officially stamped and signed by the Marine Department when issuing port clearance permits. This rule only applies to ships sailing from here to ports in China and goods loaded here and transported to ports in China, and does not apply to goods loaded elsewhere and transported to China via here or goods loaded here and transported to places outside of China. The new rules are intended to make it easier for Chinese customs to take measures to prevent smuggling, as Chinese customs have encountered some difficult problems with manifests transported from here to China. The Hong Kong government explained in a formal statement that there is reason to believe that all ships sailing from here to ports in China have obtained normal manifests here, but some ships often unload part of their cargo en route and smuggle it into China. Therefore, when these ships arrive at Chinese ports and submit their manifests for inspection, the customs authorities find that their manifests do not match those issued by the Hong Kong authorities.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Can the Four-Power Conference Break the European Deadlock?</h3>
<p>The foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union are scheduled to open a meeting in London on the 26th of this month to continue discussing peace treaties with Germany and Austria, so that Europe can restore a state of peace as soon as possible. To facilitate the progress of their work, the foreign ministers of the four countries have sent representatives to London to hold a meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers. According to a report by the United Press, the representatives of the foreign ministers of the four countries began their difficult work in a pessimistic atmosphere on the 6th of this month, in order to find a four-country agreement on the future of Germany and Austria. However, because the opinions of the four powers are so different, like traveling south to reach the north, most political commentators believe that this meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers may not be able to break the current European deadlock. However, observing the current situation in Europe, since the emergence of the New Communist International, the division of Europe has become more evident; the confrontation between the two major camps is becoming increasingly serious. If no measures are taken to remedy the situation and prevent the collapse, the future of Europe will be very bleak. The foreign ministers of the four countries, whether for their own interests or for the welfare of all European countries, have the necessity to meet at this time to find ways to save the European crisis. Therefore, all countries in the world attach great importance to this meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers and believe that this is a major key to whether the foreign ministers of the four countries can break the European deadlock.</p>
<p>Before the representatives of the foreign ministers of the four countries arrived in London, there was once optimistic news spreading internationally. According to a United Press dispatch from Berlin on the 3rd, well-informed sources from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union in this area have changed from pessimistic to optimistic about the future of the upcoming four-power foreign ministers' meeting, and believe that the meeting will at least achieve partial success. They also pointed out several optimistic factors: 1. The Soviet press's attacks on the United Kingdom and the United States have become milder; 2. The Soviet Union will make concessions to avoid deepening the divide between the East and West blocs; 3. Soviet diplomacy will undergo changes, and personnel will also be changed; 4. The Soviet Union cannot and does not want to go to war at present. Therefore, it is believed that the foreign ministers of the four countries may reach an agreement on the German and Austrian issues. This optimistic view is welcomed by those of us who desire world peace, and we hope that it can be realized. However, objective facts, especially the "cold war" that the United States and the Soviet Union are currently engaged in, and the lack of any signs of the two sides washing their hands, still prevent us from being too optimistic.</p>
<p>Since the surrender of Germany, the war in Europe has ended, and it has been two years and three months to this day, but it has not yet returned to a state of peace, and the problems after the war are endless and have not been properly resolved, causing Europe to fall into worry. Although the diplomats of the great powers have exhausted their wisdom and ability and repeatedly convened international conferences in an attempt to reach an agreement, they have never succeeded. When we study the crux of the problem, it is very clear that the German and Austrian issues are the core of today's European problems. If this major problem cannot be solved, then there is no way to solve other problems. In mid-March of this year, the foreign ministers of the four countries met in Moscow, wanting to discuss the principles of the peace treaties with Germany and Austria, but after 45 days of discussion, they only wasted the diplomats' words and achieved almost nothing. In the end, two resolutions were passed: 1. A four-power committee was established to hold its first meeting in Vienna on May 12 to discuss the differences in opinions of the four powers on the peace treaties with Germany and Austria; 2. The next meeting of foreign ministers of the four countries was scheduled to be held in London in November to continue discussing the main issues that caused disagreements between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, such as the disarmament of Germany, the movement and exchange of population, and the economic unification of Germany. The foreign ministers of the four countries dealt with the matter perfunctorily, and the Moscow meeting came to an end. By mid-May of this year, although the Four-Power Committee was held as scheduled, it did not achieve concrete results, so the world's attention turned to the UN General Assembly in mid-September. However, at Lake Success, we only heard the verbal battles of the US and Soviet representatives, and only saw the diplomatic war between the US and the Soviet Union. Also, because of the veto power issue, the US proposal to establish a 57-nation standing committee led to a stalemate in the second UN General Assembly. At that time, representatives of the communist parties of nine European countries secretly met in Warsaw, issued a declaration, and established the New Communist International, openly raising the banner of anti-imperialism in an attempt to undermine the implementation of the Marshall Plan for European aid. As a result, the European situation suddenly changed and caused two violent reactions. On the one hand, the United States accelerated the implementation of the European aid plan; on the other hand, the politics of the three Western European countries, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, shifted to the right. The results of the municipal council elections in the United Kingdom and France are a strong illustration. The divide between the two major blocs in the East and West is deepening, which is enough to deepen the European crisis and expand the rift between the United States and the Soviet Union. Rumors that the United States declared war on the Soviet Union once spread in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, which shows the fragility of the Europeans' nerves and that they can no longer withstand any nerve warfare. However, the Soviet Union is unwilling to stop its so-called nerve warfare, which is truly a major tragedy of the post-war world.</p>
<p>The Soviet representative Vyshinsky repeatedly putting the label of "war monger" on the heads of American political diplomats at the UN General Assembly was enough to stimulate the nerves of the world. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech on the 30th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution stated that atomic secrets no longer exist and pointed out that the United States surrounded the Soviet Union with military bases and harbored aggressive intentions. Is this the Soviet Union launching a nerve war offensive against the United States? Not only is it enough to disrupt the peaceful atmosphere in the international arena, but it is also enough to hinder the progress of the meeting of representatives of the foreign ministers of the four countries. We ultimately believe that Molotov's release of such stimulating remarks on the eve of the opening of the meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers is inappropriate and will cause the world to once again lose confidence and hope in the meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries. According to a United Press dispatch from London on the 6th, the United States has drafted a plan that can be submitted as soon as the meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries reaches a deadlock. It is said that the content is that the United States will make a separate peace with Germany outside the Soviet occupation zone. We assume that if the future evolution really reaches this point, the division of Europe cannot be saved.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, loving peace is the universal psychology of the world today. Regardless of nationality, race, gender, age, there is no one who does not desire peace. This is the conscience of mankind and the only force to maintain peace after the war is enough to overcome any dark forces. We have great confidence in this. As long as everyone has this conscience and everyone has this self-awareness, the international current is certainly terrible, but it is not difficult to reverse the situation. Therefore, we still have unlimited hope for the US Secretary of State Marshall, who arrived in London four days early to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference and made the greatest efforts for European peace. Marshal Ma's answer to reporters on the 5th, "I cannot express pessimism when the war is still going on," is really thought-provoking, and Marshal Ma's bold words are the only comfort for peace-loving people.</p>
<h3>Matters of Understanding in the Exchange of Notes between China and Italy</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) Regarding the solution of the problem of war damages arising from the war between China and Italy, the exchange of notes states that China and Italy have reached the following understandings:</p>
<p>The Chinese government has automatically decided to waive its right to invoke the provisions of Article 79 of the peace treaty signed in Paris on February 10, 1947, and will limit its claims to: A. Compensation for damages suffered by Chinese nationals in Italy during the war; B. Reimbursement of expenses paid by the Chinese government to maintain the lives of Italian nationals in China.</p>
<p>In order to fully resolve the above requirements, the Italian government undertakes to compensate the Chinese government: A. 100 million Italian lira; B. An additional US$18,498.16.</p>
<p>The exchange of notes between China and Italy regarding the handling of certain Italian government officials and Italian侨产业 in China states that China and Italy have reached the following understandings:</p>
<p>The Chinese government, in accordance with the laws and regulations it implements, recognizes the Italian government's rights to the following properties: A. The buildings and land of the Italian consulates in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou; B. The buildings and land of the Italian clubs in Shanghai and Tianjin and their accessories; C. The buildings within the former site of the Italian Embassy in Beiping (excluding the former barracks).</p>
<p>The Chinese government agrees to allocate to the Italian government the land within the former embassy boundary in Beiping where the former Italian embassy building is located. The Italian government shall be entitled to use it for public purposes.</p>
<p>The Chinese government will grant Italian nationals the same treatment as is now or will be granted to the nationals of Allied or neutral countries with respect to their property rights held in China.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Regulations for the Election of National Assembly Delegates and Legislators Passed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] The "Supplementary Regulations for the Election of National Assembly Delegates and Legislators" related to elections in pacification areas, after two discussions in the Legislative Yuan and after several reviews, were passed by the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 7th. This case was submitted by the State Council for discussion. During the 337th General Assembly of the Legislative Yuan, the following two points were unanimously approved: 1. When a region or a group organized according to administrative regions cannot hold elections at all, voters may register and vote according to law in neighboring regions or designated places; 2. When a region or a group organized according to administrative regions cannot hold elections in part, the competent election authority in the region shall conduct elections according to Item 1 for the part that cannot be held. However, there was considerable controversy in the meeting as to whether elections should be re-run in accordance with the election law after all constituencies have been recovered. After review by the Constitution and Legal Regulations Committee, it was decided to stipulate in Article 5 that when a region or a group organized according to administrative regions can conduct elections according to law in its entirety, general elections shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the respective election and recall laws, and the date of the election shall be determined by order of the National Government.</p>
<p>The foregoing provision shall not apply to the scope of areas where elections cannot be held in part, where the area is less than one-third or where the area is more than one-third but the population is less than one-third.</p>
<p>Liu Kezhang, convener of the Constitution and Legal Regulations Committee, explained the review process today, pointing out that the original draft stipulated that the election date would be one year, but now it is stipulated that it would be determined by order of the National Government. This is a regulation based on reality. The case was passed according to the review opinions after a brief discussion.</p>
<h3>Separate Supplementary Laws and Regulations Will Be Formulated for the Selection of Local Councilors</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] The "Amendment to the Regulations on the Provincial, Municipal, and County Councils and Provisional Councils, and the Joint Participation of People from All Parties in the Selection of Local Councilors by Selection," proposed by National Government members Xu Chuanlin and Zeng Qi and approved in principle by the State Council, caused a heated debate when it was submitted for discussion at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the morning of the 7th. In the end, it was decided to formulate separate supplementary laws and regulations. The Legal System Committee and the Local Autonomy Law Committee will first study the articles and then submit them for discussion at the regular meeting on the 15th.</p>
<p>During today's discussion of this case, two different opinions were clearly expressed: Liu Tong, Chen Xiyuan, and others agreed in principle to the addition of selected members to the provincial and municipal councils and provisional councils, but believed that it was necessary to carefully consider the method. They pointed out: 1. Some councils have already been elected by the people. Adding selected representatives now is tantamount to going backwards; 2. General elections will be held soon. Adding a selected group of representatives to the local public opinion organs is mutually contradictory in spirit; 3. Councilors represent the people. Who do the selected councilors represent? 4. Although there are regulations that local public opinion organs should be participated in by people from all parties as much as possible in their policy guidelines, this does not mean that they are "naturally" participating; 5. It is unheard of in China and abroad for local councilors to be appointed by the central government. They all believe that the destruction of laws and regulations should not be accommodated to reality.</p>
<p>Legislators Wang Shizeng, Liu Dongyan, and Luo Jingxuan from the Min and Qing parties put forward legal and political reasons, hoping that local public opinion organs can be opened to accommodate people from all parties, and cited the examples of the selection of representatives to the Constitutional National Assembly and the National Political Council.</p>
<p>President Sun Jian instructed: In the past, the Min and Qing parties did not participate in the elections when local councils were established. Now, in order to remedy this, it is stipulated that "for provincial councils that have already been established but have not been re-elected, the National Government may, in addition to the existing number of councilors, select up to three-fifths of the original number of people to be provincial councilors" so that people from both parties can participate together. However, when the council is officially established, both parties can participate in the new election, and the selection problem will not occur, so there is no need to stipulate it in the law. This regulation will only be used once, and it is unavoidable to do so. It will not be an example for the future. Using it twice is undemocratic.</p>
<p>Sun Jiulian, Huang Youchang, and others put forward revised opinions. Sun Jiulian advocated adding a clause, while Huang Youchang advocated formulating separate supplementary laws and regulations. It was resolved to formulate separate supplementary laws and regulations, which would first be submitted to the Legal System Committee and the Local Autonomy Law Committee for study and then submitted to the General Assembly on the 15th for discussion.</p>
<h3>Increasing the Number of Manchu National Assembly Delegates Indicates Ethnic Equality</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] When the Legislative Yuan discussed increasing the number of Manchu National Assembly delegates on the morning of the 7th, President Sun Jian gave a very thorough explanation of nationalism. Mr. Sun first pointed out that the Republic of China is a multi-ethnic country. The Constitution has repeatedly mentioned that all ethnic groups are equal, without distinction. Therefore, we must never have discriminatory ideas again. Although the style of Soviet doctrine is slightly different from ours, its enlightened ethnic policy is the greatest success of its nation-building and is worth emulating. Although the United States is a land of freedom, its discrimination against blacks is the biggest stain. However, in recent years, the United States has passed many laws to protect Indians, and discrimination has also been reduced. The proposers of this case to increase the number of Manchu National Assembly delegates, Yu Youren, Zou Lu, and Zhang Ji, were all anti-Manchu veterans in the past, but what they wanted to overthrow was the autocracy of the Qing Dynasty, not to hate the Manchu people. The submission of this case indicates that they treat all ethnic groups equally. For the sake of the country's future and the future of democracy, we should treat all ethnic groups equally and should not have autocratic ideas. If we are still confused by corrupt and backward ideas, a new country will be difficult to establish. Manchu legislator Guang Lu also repeatedly appealed, hoping that sympathy could be extended to the Manchu people, who number 27 million. A certain country has established a "Manchu Liberation Committee" in Chita, with ulterior motives, and we should pay attention to it. Liu Butong also said that a certain country intends to use Puyi to win over the Manchu people, which cannot be ignored. Dong Qizheng, Liu Keshu, and Zhao Naiyi agreed in principle to increase the number of Manchu representatives, but did not advocate specifically stating the Manchu people in the Constitution, because the Constitution does not specifically state other ethnic groups. It was resolved to amend Article 4 of the National Assembly Election and Recall Law to increase the number of ethnic groups elected in border areas from the original 17 to 34, and to stipulate in the allocation table that 17 members are elected by Manchu nationals, including one female representative.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Remittances from South China Flee to Hong Kong; Last Month's Figure Exceeded 100 Billion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 7th Dispatch] Since the implementation of the new foreign exchange measures, due to the wide difference between the official exchange rate and the black market rate, the amount of overseas Chinese remittances from South China that fled to Hong Kong in October was estimated to exceed 100 billion. Even when remittances arrived in Guangdong, the recipients refused to accept the money because the government compensation rate was too low, requesting that it be returned to the original remittance location and then instructing the remitter to transfer it to Hong Kong for collection. As a result, overseas Chinese remittances in Guangdong are declining daily. If the bureau does not hurry to improve the situation, the foreign exchange absorption plan will become a pipe dream.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Importers Fraudulently Request Import Quotas; Third-Quarter Quotas Temporarily Not Allocated</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 7th Dispatch] After the Guangzhou city's import license fraud case, which caused a sensation, was exposed and the main culprits were imprisoned, a new case of large-scale counterfeiting of seals and fraudulent applications for import quotas was discovered.

Among them, 251 cases were found to be counterfeit seals and fraudulent applications, and the total number of importers in the city is only 960, but the number of applicants exceeds this by 63, which is shocking.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th Dispatch] Hu Shih said today regarding the student unrest in Beiping: The students' actions this time are still considered prudent. The students should quickly return to normal. The reasons for the strike that were previously cited no longer exist. Zhejiang University, which was involved in the case, has also resumed classes.

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Security Authorities Explain the Yu Zisan Case and Clarify the Points of Zhu Kezhen's Talk</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 7th Dispatch] Regarding the points of President Zhu of Zhejiang University's speech in Beijing published in the Shanghai newspapers on the 6th, the Zhejiang security authorities made a special explanation: 1. Regarding the arrest of students without going through the school, it was found that the Yu case was received from intelligence from Beijing and Shanghai, and tracking was arranged. Chen Jianxin and Huang Bomin were found in the Datong Hotel. They were both Communist Party members from Shanghai. It was not until the arrest was made late at night that Yu Zisan and Bo Jin were found to be students of Zhejiang University, carrying various Communist Party books and secret documents. Therefore, they were arrested. They did not know that they were students of Zhejiang University beforehand, and the arrest was also made outside the school, so it seemed that the school could not be notified. 2. Regarding the failure to transfer the case to the court within the statutory time, it was found that the case involved a Communist Party conspiracy, which was related to local security. This case was handled in accordance with Articles 7 and 16 of the Outline for the Implementation of General Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion and Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Punishment for Obstructing General Mobilization, which is in full compliance with the law. 3. Regarding whether the deceased Yu Zisan was a member of the Communist Party, it was found that Yu Zisan was the person in charge of the Communist Party's New Tide Society in Hangzhou. Secret letters, lists, and other items were copied from his body. His leadership by the Communist Party and the China Democratic League was recorded in his own handwriting. President Zhu had personally read it, which can be used as evidence. 4. Regarding the truth about Yu Zisan's suicide and the joint autopsy, it was found that after Yu committed suicide, the person in charge asked the court to conduct an inspection and notified Zhejiang University to send personnel to inspect. President Zhu, Dean Gu, School Doctor Li, and two student representatives arrived at the same time. After the judge and inspectors examined it, there were no traces of injury. It was indeed suicide by sharp glass. President Zhu personally wrote "I have seen it on the spot" at the request of the prosecutor, and there was no failure to notify. As for the source of the murder weapon, the court found it under the floor of Yu Zisan's house. The court will announce the detailed evidence soon. 5. The two guards were negligent in prevention and have been detained. The legal responsibility for this matter will be dealt with according to law.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang Shipping Industry Faces Crisis; Forced to Suspend Flights, Reduce Flights, and Merge</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 7th Dispatch] According to Xiang Chunting, chairman of the Zhenjiang Shipping Industry Association, there were 218 civilian-owned shipping vessels in Zhenjiang before the war, but now there are only 28. Recently, due to low income, high expenses, and many military demands, there are many dangers. It is difficult to predict whether the water transportation between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River can continue to be maintained in the future. It was found that the Zhenjiang shipping industry had called for coal several times in October, and only 120 tons of coal were allocated, while the actual demand of various companies in Zhenjiang was 2,078 tons. The coal shortage had to be purchased on the black market, which cost about 3.2 million yuan per ton. Therefore, many shipping companies were forced to suspend flights, reduce flights, or merge and jointly operate in order to cope with the military and civilian transportation between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River. The situation is very dangerous.</p>

<h3>Molotov Explains Foreign Policy: Willing to Seek International Cooperation, Accuses the United States of Attempting to Encircle the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 6th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, speaking at a special meeting here today commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, stated that the secret of the atomic bomb is no longer the exclusive domain of the United States. He also called on anti-imperialist forces to unite into a powerful force that capitalism cannot match, in order to defeat the capitalist aggression plan.</p>
<p>Molotov stated, when mentioning foreign policy: All true friends of peace, which are the majority of people in any country, can be sure that the Soviet Union will always maintain the interests of world peace. The Soviet Union has always advocated the widespread development of international cooperation. Comrade Stalin indicated during his meeting with the famous American politician Mr. Stettinius that the United States and the Soviet Union could naturally cooperate with each other. If the United States and the Soviet Union can cooperate, then any differences of opinion will not be an obstacle. The economic systems of the United States and the Soviet Union are indeed different, but since they were able to cooperate during wartime, why can't they do so in peacetime? If there is no sincerity for cooperation, then even if the economic systems are similar, countries and peoples will still inevitably fight each other. There have been many rumors recently in the Soviet Union about the various plans of the United States, such as the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. People who hear that the United States has so many plans to aid Europe and China, etc., will certainly think that its domestic problems must have already been resolved, so it only needs to sort out the affairs of other countries, force others to accept its policies, and even organize governments on behalf of others. But in fact, this is not entirely the case. The United States, often in collusion with Britain, is seizing new naval and air force bases all over the world, and is even pursuing similar goals against entire countries, especially those close to the Soviet Union. How can such pressure from American imperialists not be denounced by anyone? The British-American Joint Chiefs of Staff established during the war is still maintained in Washington, which is definitely not for the purpose of peace, but to coerce other countries with an aggressive posture.</p>
<p>The ruling classes of Britain and the United States are now leading a "faction" that attempts to consolidate capitalism and complete the domination of others. The Soviet Union's policy is based on the opposite principle, which is to respect the sovereignty of all countries, large and small, and not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Cannot Tolerate British and American Enslavement of Europe</h3>
<p>Molotov then spoke about the German problem, saying that if Britain and the United States had been able to implement all democratic principles after the war, and the principles on the German problem in the Yalta and Potsdam conferences, then the cooperation between the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain would have been able to produce good results today. Unfortunately, Britain and the United States did not do this, and have unilaterally made the Anglo-American zone a jointly governed area. And there is no longer a German state. Britain and the United States also rely on German capitalists who previously supported Hitler, using their Ruhr industrial base to threaten countries that do not want to be enslaved, in order to achieve their goal of dominating Europe. But such adventurers' plans will certainly be opposed by the democratic countries of Europe. Judging from the German problem, we can see that the principles taken by Britain and the United States today are imperialist principles, which are completely divorced from the democratic principles on which the Soviet Union is based. In the current situation, it is necessary for the entire anti-imperialist and democratic forces in Europe and beyond to unite to resist the economic enslavement policies of the imperialists.</p>
<p>Our Officials Believe This Is a Diplomatic War of Nerves</p>
<p>[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] Officials here believe that the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is merely another war of nerves between the United States and the Soviet Union. According to the United Press's summary of the reactions of officials here, they generally suspect that Molotov's atomic bomb speech is a sign that Soviet foreign policy will have new developments. It is said that "most of the secrets" of the atomic bomb have become common knowledge. They pointed out that the Soviet Union has repeatedly hinted that atomic bomb knowledge is not exclusive to the United States, but the problem lies in continuous research and complex production technology, and not in discovering its secrets. Regarding Molotov's accusation that the United States is encircling the Soviet Union with military bases with the aim of invading the Soviet Union, officials here said that when Germany under Hitler created Germany as a country for war, it often expressed the same arguments. This is a consistent old trick used by some countries to fight other countries by using this point.</p>
<p>The US Expresses Skepticism About the Soviets Possessing Secrets</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] Experts in the US government with very high positions, while not expressing skepticism or disbelief regarding Molotov's claim that the atomic bomb has no secrets, pointed out that there is a great distance between learning the secrets of the atomic bomb and manufacturing it, including the consumption of huge amounts of money, manpower, and materials. US officials have no comment on Molotov's remarks. Representatives to the United Nations are very interested in Molotov's remarks, but also express skepticism. One European representative familiar with the Soviet Union said that Molotov's remarks are not surprising at all. Everyone knows that Soviet scientists' atomic decomposition studies are not inferior to anyone else's, but the whole question is whether the Soviet Union has the industrial capacity and manufacturing methods to produce a significant number of atomic bombs.</p>
<p>The Forefront of the Offensive on the Eve of the Foreign Ministers' Conference</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] Molotov's speech, in terms of its main points, is merely a restatement of the doctrine published by Soviet Communist Party Secretary Zhdanov at the time of the establishment of the Communist Information Bureau. The Soviet Union's theory that a postwar American economic crisis cannot be avoided is not new, but Molotov specifically reiterated the Soviet Union's new doctrine, namely that the American economic crisis is imminent, and that American imperialism is a direct result of domestic difficulties in the United States. Political observers are studying Molotov's speech in detail in order to glean from it the policy that the Soviet Union will adopt at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. Molotov said, "The principles of Britain and the United States on the German question are based on imperialism, while the Soviet Union is based on democracy." It can be seen that at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, Molotov will fully attack the development of the Anglo-American merger zone, denouncing it as an attempt to split the country and establish an anti-communist outpost.</p>
<h3>Douglas Returns Home Today</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 7th, broadcast: US Ambassador to Britain Douglas will return to Washington tomorrow to hold meetings with government officials. He plans to stay in the United States for ten days. According to Douglas, his mission to return home is to assist President Truman in submitting an emergency aid plan for Europe to Congress.</p>
<h3>Regarding the US President's Emergency Aid Plan for Europe, Congress Is Willing to Take Swift Action and Plans to Request Marshall to Attend and Explain</h3>
<p>[US Information Service, Washington, 6th] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative Herter, Vice Chairman of the House Foreign Aid Committee, stated today that Congress will take swift action on the interim relief plan for Europe. Vandenberg stated that Congress will first discuss the emergency relief plan, and then study how to assist Europe in its long-term recovery plan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The House Foreign Aid Committee decided today to propose a recommendation that the Export-Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corporation provide temporary assistance to France and Italy when necessary, until March 31 of next year.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The Republican-controlled Congress is now preparing to make things difficult for the government on the issue of aid to Europe, on the one hand demanding the release of all the facts, and on the other hand accusing the Truman administration of incompetence in handling foreign aid. When the Foreign Relations Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives meet next Monday to review the interim aid plan for Europe, they will also request Secretary of State Marshall to attend and explain. Judging from the current situation, although Truman stated when he convened Congress for a special session on the 17th of this month that the interim aid plan for Europe should be discussed as a priority, its passage will inevitably be protracted. According to House Speaker Martin, the Republican Party cannot simply be a rubber stamp for the government's plans.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Celebrates the October Revolution: A Grand Military Parade Is Held in Red Square, and Marshal Bulganin Encourages the Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 7th] Today is the 30th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, and a grand military parade was held in Red Square, inspected by Marshal Bulganin, Minister of Military Affairs. Bulganin said to the troops that capitalists are preparing for a new imperialist war, and the Soviet Union continues its struggle for peace and security. The Soviet Union's policy has won the universal support of progressive people, and peace is protected by our people and the glorious Soviet military. The Soviet army is deeply aware of the importance of its responsibilities, and under the leadership of Marshal Stalin, continues to strive to fulfill its responsibilities.</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 7th, broadcast: Moscow news, the weather on the 30th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution was cold and humid, and the entire atmosphere was filled with disgust and contempt for the United States. US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith did not attend the commemorative meeting. Although he was invited, he declined on the grounds of cold and humid weather. The US military representative to the Soviet Union also did not attend. It is worth noting that Stalin did not attend, and he may still be on vacation somewhere.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Success in Radar Detection of the Moon</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Sydney, 7th] Several prominent Australian scientists reported that they have received radar signals from the moon. On the night of the 6th, they sent radar signals to the moon from a shortwave radio station in Victoria, and some time later, they received a response signal from special instruments, and detected echoes from the moon for half an hour. They are still continuing the experiment. It is said that Sir Appleton, the British inventor of radar, predicted two years ago that radar could be used to detect the moon.</p>
<h3>The US Should Maintain Strong Bases in the Pacific, Argues Republican Congressman Cole</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] Republican Congressman Cole, who recently led a House Military Affairs Investigative Team to the Far East to investigate the conditions of US military deployments, said that the United States must establish and maintain strong land, sea, and air bases on Guam, Truk Island, and Okinawa. A peace treaty with Japan should be signed as soon as possible, regardless of whether the Soviet Union agrees or not.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Honolulu, 6th, Associated Press] The work of reorganizing the Marine Corps of the Pacific Fleet into a flexible combat unit to cope with atomic warfare has now been completed. US Marine Corps Deputy Commander Major General Shepherd said that the revolutionary reorganization can establish a highly flexible offensive force to seize the enemy's bases for launching atomic bomb attacks with lightning speed.</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers Discuss the German Peace Treaty: Two Items Are on the Agenda, and the Issue of Reparations Is Temporarily Not Submitted for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] When the representatives of the four powers' foreign ministers began to discuss the German peace treaty issue here, Soviet representative Smirnov opposed including in the agenda the issue of compensation for the property of United Nations nationals in Germany that had been transferred as war booty or reparations. He stated that the Foreign Ministers' Conference had not decided to submit this matter to the Representatives' Conference for discussion. As a result, it was decided to postpone the discussion of whether this issue should be discussed at this Representatives' Conference.</p>
<p>The items listed on the agenda of this conference are: (1) The procedure for preparing the German peace treaty; (2) The form and scope of the German provisional government. A press release issued by the conference announced other procedural resolutions established in today's meeting, including: (1) The chairmanship will be rotated by the delegations of the four countries every four meetings, in the order of Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France; (2) Reporters are not allowed to enter the venue; (3) Any representative may, in principle, raise any issue, whether or not it has already been discussed, but the issue can only be submitted for discussion with the consent of the other three representatives. It was announced that Foreign Minister Bevin telegraphed the other three foreign ministers today, suggesting that the representatives discussing the German issue should, in addition to the issues already submitted to them for discussion, also try to resolve in this meeting the issues to be discussed at the Foreign Ministers' Conference on November 25. If the representatives cannot reach an agreement on one issue, they will proceed to discuss the next issue to avoid wasting time. French representative Haduan immediately expressed his agreement with Bevin's suggestion, but the Soviet and US representatives said that they had not yet received instructions and were not in a position to accept it immediately. Also, Friday is the Soviet Union's National Day, and at Smirnov's proposal, the meeting will be suspended for one day.</p>
<h3>The British Foreign Office Denies Plans to Establish West Germany</h3>

<h3>Political Turmoil in Japan: Suehiro Nishio Accused, Cabinet Discusses the Rimpinguma Incident</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] The struggle between the Nishio and Hirano factions within the Japanese Socialist Party is intensifying. Yesterday, another Socialist Party member, Heihachiro Uekusa, filed a complaint with the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office against State Minister Suehiro Nishio, arguing that Nishio gave a speech advocating the National Mobilization Law in the Japanese Diet in 1938 (Showa 13) and should be dismissed in accordance with the Purge Directive. This is the second time that Nishio has been accused of making this speech. As early as the general election in April of this year, someone had filed a complaint with the Public Office Qualification Examination Committee.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] The Japanese Cabinet held a regular meeting on the 7th, and the Rimpinguma issue was also brought up for discussion. Rimpinguma stated on the spot that this matter was not a personal issue, but was of great importance to the clarification of the political situation, and hoped that the cabinet would fully study it.

<h3>Under the Pretext of Preventing Communist Disturbances, Japan Is Plotting to Rebuild Its Army: Behind-the-Scenes Activities Are Actively Underway</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th] According to qualified sources who told Associated Press reporters today, Japan wants to rebuild its army to ensure national security after the Allied forces withdraw. This movement is continuing behind the scenes.</p>
<p>The current new Japanese constitution naturally prohibits the organization of any army, but when the peace treaty is concluded, this issue will become more important. Which faction in the country can finally gain political power will be decided at that time. All parties expect that the situation will become more tense after the occupying forces withdraw, or that riots will occur by the Communist Party, labor leaders, and a gang of thugs. At the same time, all parties also believe that Japan is vulnerable to the invasion of Soviet forces on the Asian continent. MacArthur has made it clear that he is willing to allow Japan to strengthen its police force, but has also expressed his opposition to Japan building an army. It is said that Japan's defense against foreign attacks must be guaranteed by the Allied countries and can be guaranteed by the US Pacific base's air force. The movement to restore the army began during the Yoshida cabinet due to fear of the Soviet Union and the belief that the police force was insufficient to stop the Communist Party or labor leaders within the country, and it has been growing secretly. Later, the outbreak of the general strike was only avoided with MacArthur's direct intervention, and those who supported this proposal became more numerous as a result. However, it is not known whether a formal request has been submitted to the Allied Headquarters.</p>

<h3>Theaters Cannot Maintain Operations if Entertainment Tax is Increased</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Winter Relief Committee plans to increase the entertainment tax on entertainment businesses by 20% in order to raise funds for winter relief. This matter has aroused opposition from the film and theater industry. Foreign film distributors strongly oppose the government's move and stated that they will stop supplying films if it is decided to implement it. The theater industry has not yet received official notification, so there is no statement at present, but according to the person in charge: If the winter relief tax is increased by 20%, it will be impossible to maintain operations in reality. For example, based on the ticket price of 15,000 yuan for first-run cinemas, after deducting various taxes, the actual profit for the theater is only 3,400 yuan. If the government decides to increase the tax from the 16th of this month, the theater industry will convene a meeting of the industry to discuss countermeasures, and the result will be either theater closure or increased ticket prices.</p>

<h3>Dengtuo Road Material Embezzlement Case: Accuser Requests Continued Investigation, Expresses Disagreement with Dismissal of Seven People</h3>

<h3>Thousands of Colors and Varieties: Chrysanthemum Exhibition Opens Today, Leaders Praise Continuously After Yesterday's Preview</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Special] Our national character respects integrity and resilience, enduring hardship with a leisurely spirit. Chrysanthemums, blooming defiantly amidst the decline of other flowers, symbolize this national spirit and are admired by Chinese people. The Public Works Bureau's Gardens Administration, in this crisp autumn season, has gathered over 30,000 pots of famous chrysanthemums, holding a chrysanthemum exhibition at Fuxing Park. The dazzling array of colors and rare varieties inspire awe at the remarkable skills of the chrysanthemum growers. This chrysanthemum exhibition is divided into display and competition areas. The chrysanthemum competition area includes: Cascade chrysanthemums, small chrysanthemums with long branches, trained artificially into various cascading shapes, are very artistic. Potted chrysanthemums, with three or four flowers on each plant, come in a variety of names, including "Drunk Spring," "Phoenix Facing the Sun," "Morning Glow," "Hibiscus Spring Color," and "Emerging Lotus." Single-stem chrysanthemums, with only one stem and one flower on top, are very rare. Upright chrysanthemums, the entire plant is particularly tall and the number of flowers is also large. The Hengyuan variety is the best, and the Fourth Nursery has the most flowers, with 127 flowers.</p>
<p>Black Chrysanthemums and Green Lotus are the Most Difficult to Grow A pot of precious chrysanthemums must have a balanced plant, harmonious and bright colors, a novel and rare variety, lush stems and flowers, and no shedding of lower leaves, which is not easy to cultivate. Among the most precious chrysanthemums in this exhibition, it is said that the black chrysanthemum and the green lotus are the most precious. The black chrysanthemum is purplish-black, and the green lotus is light green. Due to the rarity of the varieties, they are also the most difficult to grow.</p>
<p>In addition, the Gardens Administration arranged various chrysanthemums such as Yellow Shushuang, White Lotus, Xueqing, and Xuexie into chrysanthemum pavilions, chrysanthemum screens, chrysanthemum bridges, chrysanthemum mountains, chrysanthemum towers, and double dragon snatching pearls, creating a fascinating scene of thousands of colors.</p>
<p>At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, the Gardens Administration first invited guests from all walks of life to a preview. Mayor Wu, Mrs. Zhao Zukang, Ambassador Situ Dangdeng, and the Canadian Commercial Counselor arrived on time, and everyone praised continuously.</p>
<p>Simple and Noble, Beneficial to Social Customs The success of this year's chrysanthemum exhibition must be attributed to Xu Tianxi, director of the Gardens Administration, horticultural expert Cheng Shifu, and his daughter Miss Chu, who have worked hard silently. They said: "Nowadays, social customs are declining, and citizens' entertainment is becoming increasingly low-level. We take this opportunity to cultivate a simple and noble interest. If we can change customs and improve social education, that is what we hope for."</p>
<p>Today, the chrysanthemum exhibition opens and is scheduled to close on the 16th. However, the weather has been particularly warm recently, and although the flowers are blooming prosperously, we are afraid that they will wither quickly. We hope that the people of Shanghai, living in dust, will not miss this once-a-year chrysanthemum festival!</p>
<h3>Xin Zhuang Three Bao Residents Petition, Requesting to be Incorporated into Shanghai Urban Area, Dispersed After Persuasion on Hu-Min Road</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Residents of the Xinzhuang District requested that the district be incorporated into the jurisdiction of Shanghai. After several meetings between representatives of Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality, a draft plan has been decided. The area east of Zhugang in Xinzhuang District will be incorporated into the urban area, and Twelve Bao, Fourteen Bao, and Twenty-six Bao, namely Changqiao, Zhuxing Town, and Wengbanqiao areas, will be incorporated into the jurisdiction of Shanghai County.

When they arrived near the No. 2 Bridge on the Hu-Yue Highway, Xu Linhai, the chief of the Longhua Police Sub-bureau, learned of this. After reporting to Inspector Zhang of the General Bureau, he immediately ordered Jia Weijun, the captain of the mobile army, to lead the mobile team and the police officers of the Second Bao Police Sub-team to rush to the scene.

<h3>Accused of Issuing Checks Indiscriminately, General Manager of XinSui Posted 100 Million Bail</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Zhu Bing, the general manager of XinSui Company, was accused of issuing checks indiscriminately, totaling more than 400 million yuan in bad checks, which were all returned. The victims filed a complaint, and the police bureau transferred Zhu to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday on charges of fraud. At 4:00 p.m., Prosecutor Xu Dingkan held a court hearing and investigation.

Zhu said at the time that he did not have such a large sum of money. The prosecutor immediately said that if there was no bail, he would be taken into custody. Last night, bailiffs took Zhu out to find bail. At around 12:00 p.m., a reporter inquired about the District Prosecutor's Office and was told that the bailiffs had not yet returned.</p>

<h3>Copyright Dispute Over English-Chinese Four-Use Dictionary: Deputy Manager of Xin Sheng Bookstore, etc., Summoned for Questioning, Deny Plagiarism</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, Jing Wen Bookstore accused Xin Sheng Bookstore of printing and publishing an English-Chinese New Character Four-Use Dictionary by reprinting Jing Wen's published English New Character Dictionary, infringing on copyright. The case is currently under investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office. On the 22nd of last month, Wu Tiesheng filed a complaint with the Jiangning Road Police Station, stating: "In the 27th year of the Republic [1938], Wu, along with Gui Shaoxu, Ge Chuanran, and Wu Mengxiong, jointly compiled the English New Character Dictionary, which was typeset and printed by Mei Ling Deng Company in Hong Kong, totaling 10,000 copies. It was distributed by Jing Wen Bookstore at 796 Beijing Road and registered with the Ministry of Interior, obtaining a copyright registration certificate. On October 10th of this year, it was suddenly discovered in the Ta Kung Pao that Xin Sheng Bookstore was publishing an English-Chinese New Character Four-Use Dictionary. Upon investigation, the content of the manuscript of that book was found to be nine-tenths identical to the English New Character Dictionary written by Wu and others."</p>
<p>After the police station dispatched officers to the Zhongwai Printing Factory at No. 30, Lane 727, Huai'an Road, the person in charge of printing the Four-Use Dictionary, Zhang Lianfang, was summoned to the station for questioning. Zhang stated, "The dictionary was entrusted to be typeset and printed by Yu Weiqing, the manager of Xin Sheng Bookstore, with a quantity of 10,000 copies. It will take another 20 days to complete printing. When the manuscript was delivered, half of it consisted of pieces of paper torn from a book, and these pieces of paper were approximately the same as the English New Character Dictionary." The police station repeatedly summoned Yu Weiqing, the manager of Xin Sheng Bookstore, without success. Therefore, Yu Shaoqing (Yu Weiqing's younger brother), the deputy manager of the bookstore, and Lu Yaping, the sales director, were summoned for the case. They vehemently denied the reprinting and claimed that there was no such thing as tearing pages from a book as a manuscript, but they were unable to produce the manuscript as proof. The police station, suspecting them of plagiarism and reprinting, ordered Yu and Lu to post bail and transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation in accordance with Article 30, Paragraph 1 of the Copyright Law. Yesterday, the prosecutor summoned the plaintiff Wu Tiesheng, the defendants Gan Shaoqing and Lu Yaping, and the witness Zhang Lianfang for questioning. The defendants claimed that the dictionary was compiled and translated by Guan Xuewen and Xia Sungui and denied plagiarism. The prosecutor stated that a detailed comparison of the two dictionaries was needed before a decision could be made, and all were ordered to return home for now.</p>
<h3>Russian Woman Who Twice Divorced Her Husband, Confined in a Mental Hospital, Former Husband Agrees in Court to Pay 40 Million Yuan in Compensation</h3>
<p>Criminal Part XIV Pronouncement</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] A 25-year-old Russian woman, Fannaditina, married Ai Sisin Keweiqi. After their marriage, they lived together at No. 6, Lane 1275, Central Linsen Road. Their relationship was generally good. On November 8th, 1946, Fan was arrested by the police for drug use and sent to a hospital for detoxification. Ai divorced Fan at this time. In mid-December, Ai went to the hospital to visit Fan and saw that Fan's addiction had been eliminated and her health had recovered. The two reconciled and on December 19th</p>
<p>remarried. However, a separation had already grown between the two, and they could not thoroughly understand each other. Finally, on February 17th of this year, they divorced for the second time. At approximately 3:00 PM on April 12th, Fan was strolling with her boyfriend at the intersection of Central Linsen Road and Sinan Road when Ai drove by. Seeing Fan, Ai stopped the car, pulled Fan into the car, and drove away quickly. Fan was confused. The car went to the Changshu Road Police Station, where Ai took Fan inside and reported to the police authorities that Fan was suffering from a mental illness and requested that she be sent to a mental hospital. The police station, accompanied by Ai, transported Fan to Minhang Puci Hospital for examination. Unexpectedly, Ai colluded with two doctors at the hospital, Peng Erna and Huang Yingbang, to certify that Fan had a mental illness and needed to remain in the hospital for</p>
<p>long-term treatment. Fan was subsequently confined in the hospital. A friend, Luo Mainuofu, went to Puci Hospital to visit his wife and met Fan, learning the details.

<p>imprisoned her without cause for more than 40 days and did not provide her with food in the hospital, so she had to sue him. The court then asked the first defendant Ai Sisin Keweiqi if he was willing to pay 40 million yuan. Ai readily agreed, immediately signing a settlement record, providing 40 million yuan, but stating that it was a "gift" to Fan. Fan refused again, requesting that it be changed to "payment."

<h3>Wang Huayi, the Main Culprit in the Trunk Corpse Case Twelve Years Ago, is Like a Trapped Beast Caught in a Tiger Trap</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Beiping Airmail Dispatch on the 5th] Twelve years ago (1936), in the last days of January, it was the time when the Spring Festival had just passed, and all the people were celebrating. The baggage section of Beiping's Qianmen Railway Station received two painted iron trunks, one blue and one purple. When weighed, they were found to be very heavy. The staff thought they were some kind of goods and requested to open them for inspection. The passenger who delivered them did not have the key and said he would go home to get it, but he never returned. These two heavy painted iron trunks, destined for Shenyang, were abandoned by their owner like discarded shoes, and no one ever came to inquire about them. The station staff became suspicious and opened the trunks. What luggage was inside? Hey! It turned out to be two piles of dismembered, bloody, and blurred male corpses. The heads, arms, and thighs had been cut off and covered with old cotton quilts.</p>
<p>This horrific trunk corpse case shocked North China and even the entire country at that time and kept the Beiping security authorities busy. Finally, the accomplice Li Liangjing, but not the main culprit, was arrested. It was learned that the deceased, Zhang Shulin, was having an affair with Wang Huayi's nanny, Liu Wangshi (commonly known as Liu Ma), at the same time as his master, who was also</p>
<p>his love rival. Wang Huayi was consumed by jealousy and later invited his brother-in-law, Xi Cangyou, and bribed the cook Li Liangjing to kill Zhang Shulin on the night of January 27, 1936. Four days later, they prepared to transport the body to Panyang to dispose of it and destroy the evidence. After the case was discovered, the accomplice Li Liangjing was arrested and sentenced to death, but Wang Huayi, the main culprit who instigated the crime, and another accomplice, Xi Cangyou, disappeared without a trace. People in Beiping and Tianjin, in the turbulent and difficult years of the past twelve years, had long forgotten this personal grievance.</p>
<p>On October 18th of this year, at No. 40, Lane 7, Dongsi, the detective team arrested a drug offender named Wang Zongyao. Wang confessed to drug use in the detective team. After being sent to the police station, Wang recanted his confession, and the police station could not proceed. He was returned to the detective team for further investigation. At this time, Wang's nephew Zhou was working hard to help him, and in some combination of circumstances, he inadvertently revealed that Wang Zongyao was Wang Huayi. Coincidentally, a reporter was nearby, and the next day, the news was published in the newspaper with a large headline. On the other hand, the Detective Team No. 8, which was re-investigating the case, was the same detective team that handled the trunk corpse case twelve years ago. So, they found the original file and interrogated him strictly, finally unearthing this</p>
<p>man who had changed his name and hidden himself</p>
<p>and had traveled far and wide, a "living dead man".</p>
<p>After a veteran team member who had worked in the detective team for fifteen years recognized him as the main culprit in the trunk corpse case twelve years ago, and after Liu Liushi, who was familiar with Wang, identified Wang Zongyao as Wang Huayi, Wang Zongyao could no longer deny his original name, Wang Huayi. He is now sixty-two years old, with a burly body, pale complexion, fierce eyes, and a full beard. In the detective team, wearing a blue coat, yellow leather shoes, and velvet trousers, he looked extremely embarrassed, like a trapped beast in a tiger trap.</p>
<p>Twelve years is a long time. People and things have changed, becoming unpredictable. Wang Huayi, who had originally run away and traveled far and wide, has returned to the original place after twelve years</p>
<p>wearing shackles.</p>
<p>However, Li Liangjing, the accomplice who was arrested after the incident, has regained his freedom after ten years behind bars. According to lawyer Gao, ten years in prison have greatly changed Li Liangjing. Li was not very literate before, but after fighting a lawsuit for ten years, Li's writing has become clear and readable, and his handwriting is also good. However, his strength has become much weaker. Because of the murder case, it is not easy for him to find a job. Although he has the skills of a cook, he had to change careers. It is said that Li has returned to his native Suining. He has not been seen for the past year.</p>

<h3>Analysis by the Economic Research Department of the National Bank: Deposit Currency Circulation Speed, The Relationship Between Floating Capital Moving South and Overseas Remittances is Not Very Close</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Regarding the recent trend of currency circulation speed and capital moving south, a reporter visited the person in charge of the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank yesterday, who provided a detailed analysis as follows:</p>
<p>The currency circulation speed of Shanghai commercial bank deposits, calculated starting from this year, has now been calculated up to June. The circulation speed for each month is as follows: January: 19.77, February: 24.63, March: 21.32, April: 22.57, May: 33.96, June: 38.05. The calculation for July is in progress and is expected to be even higher than June. This circulation speed is the circulation speed of deposit currency (current deposits), not the circulation speed of legal tender (banknotes). It is often mistakenly referred to as the circulation speed of legal tender, which is not factual. In reality, although we cannot calculate the circulation speed of banknotes, it is undoubtedly much lower than the circulation speed of deposit currency (also known as credit). Furthermore, this circulation speed of deposit currency only includes the deposit currency of commercial banks and does not include the deposit currency of state banks. Since state banks do not allow the use of negotiable instruments, the circulation speed of deposit currency in state banks is much lower than that in commercial banks. Moreover, this department has not yet started this work in other cities, but it can be asserted that the circulation speed of deposit currency in other cities is lower than in this city. This is not only because this city is the largest speculative market in the country, but also because other cities rarely have a negotiable instrument system.</p>
<p>The movement of domestic floating capital is mainly due to speculation and smuggling. Recently, the relationship between the southward movement of floating capital and overseas remittances has not been very close. Generally speaking, floating capital is still concentrated in Shanghai because Shanghai is the place for speculation and hoarding. As for the recent flow of floating capital to South China, it is related to the "all-access permit."</p>

<p>Yesterday, domestic sales of black and green tea continued to be like fish in water, especially ordinary black tea and Ping Shui flag tea, which were even more favored by buyers. Opening prices were uniformly excellent. As for the foreign firm tea market, the English merchant export firm continued to suppress the price of this year's Keemun black tea, and because sellers were unwilling to sell easily, transactions remained unclear and the situation remained firm and quiet. As for other green tea varieties, the French firm Yongxing continued to be interested in Anhui and Tunxi merchants, but due to the scarcity of goods and supply shortages, the process was not lively.</p>
<p>Commercial Briefs</p>
<p>The National Goods Factory Association held a board meeting yesterday and resolved to telegraph the central government again, petitioning to consider the actual difficulties of the business community and allow the use of current bills for turnover.</p>
<p>The November issuance of 36-year short-term treasury bonds, as of the 6th, has sold a total of US$1,040,390, equivalent to 54,764,850,000 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<p>The first batch of Japanese reparations goods will arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month and will be temporarily stored and piled up. A decision will be made later.</p>

<h3>Reader Consults on Legal Doubts: Weak Woman Under the Shackles of Old Morality Seeks to Break Free and Pursue Light</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: I am a woman shackled by old morality. I am already twenty years old this year. When I was six years old, my grandmother decided on my marriage to a man surnamed Guo. At that time, because I was young and ignorant, I naturally did not object. For thirteen years, I have had no feelings for Mr. Guo at all, and even his appearance is vague to me. Furthermore, he enlisted in the army in the winter of the 33rd year and has been away since. In these three long years, he has sent no news to me. From this, it seems that I have disappeared from his heart.</p>
<p>Last spring, I studied at a certain school and met a classmate named Li. Under enthusiastic encouragement, our feelings grew with each passing day. For more than a year, we have plunged into the white-hot sea of love. So I asked my father to cancel the engagement with the Guo family, but my father flatly refused in a feudal tone. In this environment blocked by old morality, I have become a fragile lamb, not knowing what method to use to resolve this difficult problem. I have long heard that your newspaper is a guide for lost souls. I respectfully ask you to shed light on the following questions, for which I will be extremely grateful. Is the marriage contract made by my grandmother without reaching the legal age valid? Can I individually publish a statement in the newspaper denying this marriage contract? If I propose to cancel the engagement, can the other party demand compensation for losses? If the other party does not agree, what should be done? If I have not dissolved this marriage contract, can I get engaged to Mr. Li? Are there any other issues regarding legal preferential treatment for Mr. Guo as an active-duty soldier? If my parents do not agree, what legal methods can I use to deal with this? From reader He Fen.</p>
<p>[Lawyer Chuan Kuang Replies] If the person has reached adulthood, they can claim that the marriage contract made by their parents in the past is invalid. Yes. If the other party is not at fault, they can demand compensation for damages suffered as a result. If the other party does not agree, it can be ignored. Yes. No. Cannot be forced to perform.</p>

<h3>The Rage of the German Writer Fritz Von Unruh</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Fritz Von Unruh is a famous German playwright and lyric poet. When the Nazis came to power, he, like Thomas Mann and other modern German writers, fled abroad. During the war, he was in France and lost everything, including his manuscripts. He was imprisoned in a French concentration camp. It was Einstein and Thomas Mann who asked President Roosevelt to rescue him. He arrived in the United States in 1941. In the United States, he relied on his own memories and the imagination of "angry anti-Teutons" to create a "panorama of the apocalyptic era." At the end of his strange and huge long novel, he only added a simple note. He said: "I wrote the dance of death of this era in dramatic prose. By doing so, I was isolated in the darkest and most secluded places, making it easy for me to analyze the microbes that Nazism infected me with. I not only showed it to others but also pointed out the possibility of eradication—that is the consciousness of this work." This work is called "The End Is Not Yet." Before its publication, many translators were eager to translate it, and many publishers saw the original manuscript. To quote the author, everyone "was amazed by this dramatically moving epic."</p>
<p>Thomas Mann believed that Unruh was the most talented German playwright of the past decade or so, and Unruh's lyrical poems are also the best in modern German literature. Obviously, such a profoundly creative writer (his recent works are all symbolic) can produce very moving novels describing the Nazi devastation of culture. Furthermore, his poetic and dramatic genius are products of his strong personality and powerful self-confidence. His ancestors were wealthy Prussian landowners, and his father was the governor of East Prussia and a friend of Hindenburg. Such a person, after enduring the humiliation of ten years of exile and escape, after his books were burned by the Nazis and he was deprived of his citizenship, could not write his epic prose novel. His heart was burned by rage against the huge group that brought his country to ruin and caused the Second World War. He could only turn his anger into dramatic symbolism, and his sad memories into cohesive narratives. The result is this book. The terror and corruption created by the madmen written in it are almost unimaginable.</p>
<p>One scene takes place in the German Embassy in Paris. Hitler, Goebbels, Hess, and many officers are present. A Polish Jewish dancer, Nadia, is thrown into a cage with a large ape. "The African great ape wrapped its huge arms around Nadia's hips. Her screams disappeared in laughter and shouts. Saliva dripped down Hess's chin. He shouted: 'Like the law of the Pharaohs against the Jews, it is necessary to prevent inferior races from mixing with the noble Egyptian race, thus degrading it. Drive the Hebrews out of the Nile.' Hitler ran to the side of the cage, 'That's right. I want to sterilize all of you people in the world! You rising sow,' Nadia's hands trembled weakly, 'Oh God, oh God! Are you going to drown them? Dear, dear God, drown them. Drown them in a red sea of blood, a sea of blood, these murderers!'" This imaginary sentence is very simple.</p>
<p>On the same night, in another scene, the murderous demon Buch tortures a Polish Catholic dancer to death. Hitler, out of insane selfishness, wants to bring the dead girl back to life. When the naked corpse of the girl is placed in front of Hitler's feet, he says to the officer Keitel: "Keitel, listen to me. My flesh has been crawling all the way to my fingertips! My blood feels a stinging sensation, as if ants are walking into my veins! What? It would be a joke if a superman like me, Hitler, would be like this in front of such a weak female corpse!" He clenched his fist and struck the spiritual keys, and the strings made a clanging sound. "Keitel! You are a noble warrior, and I solemnly ask you, do you believe that I can bring this dead dancer back to life?" Initially, the dancer was invited to dance, Hitler was with her, stripped her clothes, and forced her to dance on the large glass floor of his study. The result naturally reached the climax of madness and depravity. The madness of Hitler and his subordinates is not only expressed once in the whole book. Hitler's boasting and madness almost made readers not believe that his power had expanded to Germany and most of Europe. The animal that Unruh portrayed seems to be entirely imaginary, and the people around him also seem to be from a mental asylum.</p>
<p>Part of what Unruh wrote is factual. We may as well regard this book as a fable. The characters in it are all symbols, not men and women of flesh and blood. But symbolism and allegory fully capture the madness and inhumanity of the Nazis.</p>
<h3>Small Note on Being Pickpocketed</h3>
<p>— ·Qu Yi Xiao Li·</p>
<p>After receiving a small amount of manuscript fees, I went out with my wife to buy some fabric to prepare winter clothes for the children. I am ashamed to say that although the country has won, we, who have experienced great disasters, are still wearing ragged clothes like we did ten years ago when we returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>We went to a large company on Nanjing Road and bought two pieces of clothing material and two sets of what we considered cheap and good children's clothing. After repeated planning, we bought a Jishi brand electric clock and dragged our tired steps and satisfied hearts out of the Xinxin Company.</p>
<p>The sun was now shining slantingly on the road. The good time of the whole half-day had passed quickly like this. I began to feel a little hungry, so I suggested going to Dasanyuan for refreshments.</p>
<p>My wife and I talked about what we bought and studied the colors of the clothing material. I was most happy that we had bought an electric clock. From now on, when I rest from writing at night, I will no longer have to wait for the neighbor's clock to tell me the time. My wife was also happy for me, so I took out a pen from my inner pocket and drew on the back of the tea menu the place where I planned to hang the electric clock.</p>
<p>In this way, we finished our refreshments very satisfactorily. Because we were too excited, I carelessly stuck my pen in the small pocket outside my suit. Carrying the full load of things, we walked out of the Dasanyuan restaurant.</p>
<p>On Nanjing Road, we were still talking happily when we suddenly saw people surrounding a fallen electric pole. I said to my wife, "It looks like a military vehicle caused trouble again—."</p>
<p>At this time, a man in his thirties, speaking fluent Beijing Mandarin, continued, "Isn't it a military vehicle?" He pointed to a shop with iron doors closed and said, "What a force! It knocked down the electric pole, ran onto the sidewalk, and drove straight into someone's shop..."</p>
<p>"Was anyone injured?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Of course, someone was injured..." he said, and then hurried away.</p>
<p>Suddenly I was awakened by a kind of alertness and quickly touched my pocket. My pen was long gone.</p>
<p>I very upsetly took a pedicab home. To us literati, a pen is like a soldier's gun. A soldier who has been disarmed has lost his inherent courage and combat ability. I was such an absurd soldier.</p>
<h3>Tennyson: Break, Break, Break</h3>
<p>— Zhen Quan Shi (Translator)</p>
<p>Break, break, break,</p>
<p>On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!</p>
<p>And I would that my tongue could utter</p>
<p>The thoughts that arise in me.</p>
<p>O well for the fisherman's boy,</p>
<p>That he shouts with his sister at play!</p>
<p>O well for the sailor lad,</p>
<p>That he sings in his boat on the bay!</p>
<p>And the stately ships go on</p>
<p>To their haven under the hill;</p>
<p>But O for the touch of a vanish'd hand,</p>
<p>And the sound of a voice that is still!</p>
<p>Break, break, break,</p>
<p>At the foot of thy crags, O Sea!</p>
<p>But the tender grace of a day that is dead</p>
<p>Will never come back to me.</p>
<p>[This poem was first published in Tennyson's "Poems" in 1842. Tennyson wrote this poem and the long poem "In Memoriam" for the death of his friend Arthur H. Hallam. The latter has become one of the three major elegies in English literature. - Translator]</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>"So, who initiated this night raid?" In my imagination, it was like a movie, projecting some terrifying scenes. Spies, counter-spies, counter-counter-spies, all sorts of complex plots intertwined, playing out a terrifying and tragic story. Just thinking about the ending of this story sent chills down my spine.</p>
<p>"You could say it was Mrs. Shaw, or you could say it was me, or you could say it was initiated simultaneously by both of us!" Yaoqun casually replied to me.</p>
<p>"Then what was Mrs. Shaw's motive?" Thinking of the terrible ending of things, I asked Yaoqun.</p>
<p>"She didn't explicitly state it. But..." Yaoqun said calmly, "But I know very well that she also wants to take advantage of the conflict between our two armies to find a way to slip away on her own. According to her, she very much wants to see her old friend, who is now the Commander-in-Chief defending Nankou."</p>
<p>"He's going to sneak through alone?" My doubts deepened.</p>
<p>"That's right." Yaoqun nodded; "Initially, when planning this night raid, just yesterday afternoon, she wanted to invite us to go together. Because I didn't want her to know my subsequent actions, I didn't say anything. She nodded casually, and I don't know why she nodded. Perhaps this afternoon, she will bring up this matter again to discuss with someone, who knows."</p>
<p>Yaoqun and I were talking here. Little Tiger sometimes sat quietly listening on the side; sometimes walked around, strolled a few steps outside, and came back again; presumably taking on the responsibility of guarding. In the corner of the room, Dingyuan, sitting on a pile of straw, was already fast asleep, snoring from time to time, probably because he was extremely tired; so when we spoke, we kept our voices very low, for fear of waking him up.</p>
<p>Regarding Dingyuan's problem, I originally planned to bring it up and discuss it with Yaoqun; to see what Yaoqun's opinion was: should we let him continue to drift along here as he is now? Or should we prepare to take him back to Peiping and entrust him to Mr. W? Or do we have other plans for him? As for me, I very much hope that Dingyuan can return to Peiping, to a sanatorium, whether in the city or in the Western Hills, to let him rest and recover for some time. And wait until his health is fully restored, and then find a way to send him to the south, to join the engineering corps in the army, so that he can also make a career. Because I deeply know that talents like him are greatly needed by any military group.</p>
<p>Yaoqun saw me lower my head in contemplation, knowing that I was thinking, so he also remained silent for the time being. The room was unusually quiet except for Dingyuan's breathing and occasional snoring. Just after these few minutes of silence, I was just about to bring up Dingyuan's problem to Yaoqun when I suddenly saw Little Tiger leap up from the ground, as agile and light as a civet cat; at the same time, he looked at Yaoqun and me, stretched out both hands, and pressed down in the air, looking very nervous.</p>
<p>"What...?" Yaoqun and I were both taken aback; the three words "What's the matter?" had not yet fully left my mouth, Little Tiger glared with a pair of large round eyes, and pressed down even harder on us in the air with his outstretched hands.</p>
