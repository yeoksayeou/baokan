<h3>國民黨候選人名單送交選總澈夜審校選所委員經政黨提名者決予以剔除民靑兩黨名單尙待績商</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕政黨提名之國代候選人名單，因民，靑兩黨對審定後之名額有所異議，尚待續商。國民黨中常會七日下午將開臨時會，討論此事。</p>
<p>〔又電〕國代候選人政黨提名單，國民黨部份約達千名，已於六日淸晨三時送達選總。選總竟日趕辦審校，校對之工作。迄午夜尚未竣事。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕張厲生於六日晚對中央社記者稱：目前總所愼重考慮者，乃全國各級選所萬餘人之選舉委員，多有參加政黨提名者。此種候選人，照選舉法令規定，不得參加競選，故應照審查程序，予以剔除。此項工作，可能於七日全部完成，一俟民靑兩黨所提候選人名單送達選總所並經審查後，即行一併公告。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京六日電〕外傳國民黨國代候選人名單，將由蔣總裁作最後決定，絕對不確。惟中央及地方負重要軍政責任之國民黨同志候選人名單，已由中央黨部送呈總裁核定，聞總裁希望中央及地方軍政負責同志，除必要者外，能不參加者，可不必參加國代競選，以便讓予其他人士。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕選總主席委員張厲生談稱：國民黨所提名單，係本天下爲公，選賢與能之旨，不僅提出國民黨黨員，同時對黨外賢達亦均提出。</p>
<p>〔又電〕靑年黨提名之國代名額原爲三百名，經審定者爲二百零九名，民社黨原定名額爲二百六十名，現經審定者爲一百九十餘名，距兩黨要求頗遠。六日晨國民黨吳鐵城，陳立夫先後邀晤民。靑兩黨人士交予審核接之名單時，民靑兩黨人士認爲審核後之名單，有考慮之必要，當經彼等將審定名單交黨內對論，然後再作決定。民社黨徐傳霖，蔣勻田即於昨午後飛滬，隨即召開緊急中常會，會商至晚間九時，決定徐。蔣等於七日晨返京，與國民黨代表再作洽商。靑年黨亦已將原名單送回國民黨並提出四點，希望能予做到；　該黨重要人物，希望能列入名單。　已列爲候補者，其中一部份希望能改爲正式。　若干列入某地當選者，希望易另一地區選出。　若干不重要人物被提名者，希望能予劃除。政府方面對此甚感困擾，因該黨名單如有變動，必牽涉國民黨巳決定之名單也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕監院六日晨談話會，對選舉問題亦曾談及。若干監委認爲，以前會任僞職者斷不容混跡各種候選人之中，如有發見，應依法檢舉，當作成建議，並有監委廿餘人簽名</p>
<p>〔中央社蘭州六日電〕甘省內地生活習慣特殊國民及藏區國代候選人，六日晨由省選所公佈。前者于正熙，吳九如，古希賢，冷發秀，馬閣麟，罵福林等六人，後者孔繼周，鎖藏佛，雷兆祥，楊生華等四人。</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫警告美國原子彈已無秘密並稱蘇聯決爲和平奪門</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦六日廣播：莫斯科訊，今日爲蘇聯十月革命三十週紀念，外長莫洛托夫發表演說稱：原子彈之秘密早已不再存在，美國欲藉原子彈以自重，顯屬幻想，當時聽眾歡呼之聲雷動。莫氏復稱；蘇聯所最重視者，厭爲和平之確保，世界各國中之愛好和平人民，可以確信蘇聯必將爲和平奮鬥到底。渠引證史達林與史泰森之談話，當時蘇聯首長曾力言兩種不同之經濟制度可以合作，和平相處。惟渠謂：「在吾人之時代中，所有道路均係通往共產主義者」。莫洛托夫並對美國帝國主義大施抨擊，並暗中予以警告。渠謂：侵略性之帝國主義，實係資本主義之危機所在，目前一般人似尚不易發覺，但隨時間之進展，終將自食其惡果。莫氏繼即稱道在南斯拉夫京城成立之共產國際情報局，高呼十月革命之成功，顯示資本主義業已接近末路。至於莫氏所稱原子彈秘密已不再存在一點，實係蘇聯領袖之新說素。按以前蘇方時常指責美國企圖獨佔原子彈秘密者也。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約六日廣播：成功湖訊，莫洛托夫所稱原子彈秘密已不再存在一說，在聯合國各國代表中引起紛紛猜測，有人以爲此說並不新頴，亦有人以爲在原子彈製造方面，美國至少較蘇聯進步十五年，莫氏之演說，猶如胆怯之小孩走過墳地，狂吹口哨，藉壯胆氣而已。</p>
<h3>美對華政策馬卿仍不願表示</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕國務卿馬歇爾四日在記者招待會稱：渠正在考慮中國全部問題，但重申渠拒絕將魏德邁報告公布之主張。記者詢以該報告爲何仍保持秘密，馬歇爾答稱：此係由於渠早已宣布之原因。渠稱：渠本人覺並無將之公布，或將渠與總統所會討論之一切發表之必要。記者詢以該報告最後發表時，是否包括美國對華能度一項節要在內，渠稱：渠對此不願評論，馬歇爾並對中國是否包括於世界開發計劃，如馬歇爾計劃之內，亦拒絕評論。惟渠稱：渠不能說明任何予華援助是否與其他援助分開</p>

<h3>張瀾談話希望以往明守法</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前民盟主席張瀾，昨日發表書面談話如下：「余迫不得已，忍痛於十一月六日通告全體民主同盟盟員，停止政治活動，並宣布民盟總部解散。但我個人對國家之和平民主統一團結之信念，及爲此而努力之決心，絕不變更。我希望以往之全體盟員，站在忠誠國民之立場，謹守法律範圍，繼續爲國家之和平民主統一團結而努力，以求達到目的。」</p>
<h3>蘇聯革命紀念主席特電致賀</h3>

<h3>財部飭行局庫注意貸款用途</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕關於監委李世軍建議停止商業貸款，工業方面加以嚴格規定尺度可放寬，稽核監督則須加嚴一事，頃據財政部息：「國家行局庫所辦生產貸款，其主旨在謀增加生產，平抑物價，流暢物資，促進出口，故對於民生日用必需品之產銷，基本工鑛，出口貿易及交通公用等事業，歷經配合政府經濟政策曁各業實際需要，核實貸助，至普通商業貸款，各行局庫早經規定停止承做，又關於貸款用途之考核，亦極重視，除汝貸行局庫經常派員監督外，並由四聯所派稽核分區績密辦理，務期用途正當切實，有助於生產，間有少數不符規定者，則通知承貸行局庫，嚴切糾正或收回其借款，各借款廠商用其借得資金購原料，對於物價目不能毫無影響，惟謂游資之充斥，投機之盛行，由於貸款所致，似亦非事實。李監委建議政府早經注意辦理，此後自當嚴飭各行局庫，恪遵政府政策及有關各項規定，切實注意。</p>
<h3>東北華北工廠並無南遷擬議</h3>
<p>政院令覆瀋市臨參會</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽六日電〕瀋市臨參會，曾於上月上函中央，請停止拆運東北及華北目下不能開工之生產設備南遷計劃，政院特覆令瀋市府轉臨參會稱：據經部呈復，經部在瀋陽。天津設工商輔導處，即爲促進東北及華北之民營事業，開工工廠積極生產，未開工者早日復工，並無將工廠南遷擬議。據悉：此或由資委會等機構擬將此間廢置小型罵達機械南遷應用引起之誤會。</p>
<p>〔本報瀋陽六日電〕陳誠五日夜召集資源委會東北工礦各單位負責人談話，研討東北工礦目前危機，聞多主張先安定煤礦生產，以使火力發電，燃料無缺，以使工礦復活，其次爲交通等。</p>
<h3>菲拒台胞入境激怒華僑團體馬尼刺日報又發謬論</h3>
<p>〔中央社馬尼刺五日電〕此間晚報消息：中國前此要求菲政府授權台灣美領事，爲台灣華僑之欲入菲境者簽發護照一節，業遭菲政府拒絕。據菲方稱：係因在將來之日本和約會議決定台灣人民戰後地位以前，台灣人民不論其祖先是否中國人，一律作爲日本國人民看待。晚報希望菲外交部發表另一否認之聲明，菲政府對於台灣人民之懷疑態度，業激怒此間華僑團體，並招致外交觀察家之尖銳批評。某外交觀察家謂：倘唯有未來之日本和約會議始能斷定台灣之地位，則菲律賓之地位，亦有待於該同一會議決定之，蓋台菲均曾一度在日本佔領之下。</p>
<p>〔聯合社馬尼刺六日電〕美商「馬尼刺日報」今日社論評稱：中國行政院長張羣最近宣布要求收回琉球，乃一種政治測騐，以卜國際風向。琉球對於中國並無經濟上之價值，而美國則犧牲金錢與生命爲數頗巨。爲求公平起見，不但琉球應由聯合國機構代管，台灣亦然。（台省各報抨擊罵尼刺公報謬論刊二版三欄）</p>

<h3>編製來年度國家總預算的商權</h3>
<p>上海市政府三十七年度歲入歲出總預算案，日前業經市參議會大體通過，將由市政府呈報中櫃核定。因此，想到一年一度的國家歲入歲出的總預算，又將要經過彙編，審查，核定的階段了。在通貨迅速膨脹，物價直綫上騰的今天，侮一家庭，每一事業，還不能訂定半年或三個月的精確頸算，何况國家的軍事，政治，經濟，教育，建設，交通等等各部門的艱巨工作，那裏可以把法幣的數字來作一年的打算？道在編製者，審查者，核定者固然覺得頭痛，就是我們要就龐大的數字中加以評判，也徒覺其煩惱面不切實際了！</p>
<p>一個稅收機關的主管，常常以本年的稅收超過預算而沾沾自喜；一個事業機關主管，往往以預算不敷不能完成工作而藉口推諉。我們把通貨膨脹和物價飛漲的因素來評判上述兩個機關的成績，覺得稅收的超過預算，不是主管人的整頓之功，而是物價水漲船高的結果，事業的不能完成，不應推諉于預算的不敷，而應歸咎于主辦人之沒有遠見。我們過去許多建設事業受了預算的束縛終至半途而廢的，其例甚多；滬在經費上固是一個極大的浪費，而在時間上，尤爲不可補償的損失。按照目前制度，凡是支出部門，預算所未列入的，或是雖已列入預算而數額超過預算的，無論事業怎樣重要，工作怎樣緊急，審計機關不予報銷，即在事業進行中，因了審計機關的拖延，在物價劇烈波動的當兒，短期內的頸算也就不能適合，何况較大的建設事業斷非短期內所可完成呢？</p>
<p>所以時至今日，我們要求各部門事業的進展，非把以法幣歡字編製頸算的制度重新加以檢討不可。這並不是說我們不需要預算，相反地，我們實在需要預算，需要切實可行的預算，我們要以預算來督促事業的完成，不要以頸算來阻碍事業的推進。本此立論，我們願提供一種意見，主張以工作爲單位的預算來代替以法幣爲單位的預算。例如：交通部於三十七年度內要造成一千公里的一條鐵路，預算上就應開列需用枕木若干，鍋軌若干，人工若干，需時若干，枕木和鋼軌來源如何，遝輸情形如何，如在需用材料數量預算以內，而又如期完成，即可不問其法幣支出若干，而予以騐收，如果審計機關非有法幣的數字和證明支出是否實在不可，也儘可將購入材料的憑證和按月工人生活指數加以事後的審　，若是以法幣為輩位來做預算，總使每月追加，也就無法完成了。現在尤值得我們注意的，當此幾亂時期，繳匪的軍事與收復區的救濟，所需自極浩大，而又無法估計。士兵的給養，軍需的補充，老弱的救濟，難民的復員，廢墟的重建，田地的整理，在事前既不能搬具正確的預算，在這行的過程中，所有經費的支出，也是日增月加，試問這件關係國家存亡興廢的大事，應否為了預算的來　而就此不辯或使之半途而廢？在匪禍尚未　平之前，一切建設還是徒勞無功，何不集中一切力量，先來完成　亂的工作？那無論任何的代價，自應在所不惜了！</p>
<p>國家預算，應以量入為出呢，抑以量出為入呢？一個國家正在進行軍事的時候，量入為出固是絕不可能，量出為入也無不能平衡，幾是戰時國家的通例，唯一的補救辦法，不是發行實，但大部份還脫不了法幣的範疇，即使從價徵稅，因了物價的高漲使稅收同樣增加，究不能與支出成一比例。因此，收支不能平衡，幾是戰時國家的通例，唯一的補救辦法，不是發行內儐，便是舉辦外債，這個捕救辦法，當然已在政府考慮——或許已在進行——之中。我們却望主持財政黨局要有偉大的魄力來進行這件工作，不要因了法幣赤字的龐大而趨趄不前，甚至使各部門事業趨於停滯。</p>

<h3>楊兆龍報告詞</h3>
<p>報告畢，由司法行政部刑事司長楊兆龍報告國外考察司法經過，略謂：渠去歲奉派出國考察，並代表我國政府出席國際刑法學會五屆會議，國際刑法統一會議及國際罪行等研究委員會等，前後十閱月，遍歷英·美歐陸等西洋司法先進國家，對其司法行政之組織及工作，法制之變遷及改革，立法原則之趨向及監所情形等，均所留意。英美司法行政均正謀建立糸統之組織，歐陸各國則依世界法律問題之發展，如涉外事件，幼年犯罪及感化敎育之日趨重要，各就司法組織及工作之完整努力。法制方面，美國無大改革，英國及歐陸各國均因戰時及戰後情勢之所需，變遷頗大。德·義·法典中反動內容已予淸除。法·比正從事修訂主要法典。此外，檢察官之權限均有擴充之勢，至於近年各國之立法，除注重國際性外，大都趨於自由刑之减少與感化敎育之推廣，法國對幼年罪犯之處理最爲合理，其職業學校毫無監獄意味，頗收改善犯人之效。楊氏認爲：抗戰勝利後，我國司法方面已發生許多新問題，如民刑涉外案件及監獄困難等等，均賴同人等根據實際經驗及新頴學理加以解決。</p>
<h3>顧大使等招待記者</h3>
<p>（上接一版）蔣廷黻對此點亦發表意見，認爲如聯合國能以公正方式處理朝鮮問題，並協助朝鮮獲得眞正之獨立，則朝鮮將成爲遠東方面之斯堪的納維亞半島，否則朝鮮將成爲遠東之巴爾幹。記者詢問設若干會負國實行拒絕參加之恫嚇，則擬議中設置關於希臘及朝鮮之兩委員會以及擬議設置之小型大會將如之何？顧氏承認若干會員國如不參加些二械稱，則此三機構工作時，將有阻碍。惟此種行動雖令人遺遺憾，但聯合國將貫澈其決議，聯合國決不能因一二會員國之拒絕參加而諉卸責任也。　大使稱：聯合國處理小型大會，希臘問題及朝鮮問題之方式，已加强大會之權力。至於巴力斯坦，渠認爲其中最困難之間題有二：　如何實行分治計劃，　英軍撤退後，如何維持當地治安。蔣廷敝旋就此點闡明中國對巴力斯坦之立塲，即中國不反對巴力斯坦分治，但反對强迫實行分治。代表我國出席社會慈善文化小組委會之張彭春謂：經社理事會自明年起，可準備處理迫切之經濟與社會問題。代表我國出席託管小組委會及法制小組委會之劉鍇稱：大會於此次會議中，曾就涉及非自治土地及委任統治地方人民福利問題施行壓力。論及法制委會工作時，劉氏曾提及中國在發展及編纂國際法方面所採取之積極地位。</p>

<h3>台報抨擊菲報謬論我須堅持歸還琉球</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北五日電〕此間今有兩家報紙撰文，均以不能容忍之態度抨擊馬尼刺公報之言論。全民日報令以「正告菲律賓」爲題，發表社論稱：「菲方或因反對琉球歸還中國尚有困難，故又提及台灣作爲討價還價之條件，冀使中國爲欲保持合灣而放棄琉球，然台灣乃中國之領土，而於五十三前被日本所侵佔者，前年日本戰敗，即使無開羅會議之決定，中國亦應立即收復台灣，此乃事理之常然。」民間所辦之公論報，則認爲合灣乃中國之一環，不容任何人士討論。該報稱：對於以民族自決方式確定台灣政治地位之主張，吾人所感覺者，衹是一種被侮辱的憤怒與桃撥性的刺耳，台灣並非收養子，而係與其祖國之母體血肉相聯，其在中國大家庭中之地位，乃爲先天所決定者，今幸重返祖國之懷抱，試問還待抉擇什麼？究應如何自決？至於琉球歸還巾國問題，上述兩報亦均認爲我國必須堅持此項主張。全民日報並稱：對於對於和約問題，中國熊度已較蘇聯寬大，蘇聯主張僅由四强會議，中國主張由對日有關國家參加討諭，俾菲國將來亦可參加和會，然菲方對待中國，今竟全無友誼，吾人實有無限之憤慨。</p>

<h3>四外長代表會議開始商討對德奧和約馬歇爾定本月二十赴英</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦六日電〕英外交部宣布：討論德國問題之四强外長代表，定六日標準時間下午三時四十分在倫敦開會。議程主要事項，爲　商談對德和約之程序，德國之政治機構，組織保護聯合國在德僑民之機構。</p>
<p>〔聯合社倫敦六日電〕美英法蘇四國外長代表，今日在悲觀氣氛中開始工作，謀對德國與奧地利前途問題覓取協議，究將採取何種步驟給予德奧兩國在復興歡洲中之地位，四國意見大相逕庭。據通常可靠人士聲稱：美國業已擬就方案，一俠本月廿六日四外長會議陷於僵局後，即可正式提出，該項方案無異將與德國蘇軍佔領區以外部份單獨議和。英國雖不欲積極支持美國提案，但似極願以美蘇兩國之調解人自任。法國立場現尚不明，據官方發言人稱，該國將反對在德國設立強有力中央政府，主張採取鬆弛聯邦制，並堅持國際共管魯爾工業區。但主要間題端繫於蘇聯之態度。眾信蘇聯爲避免與西方各國間裂痕加深起見，或將减抵其在德國現行生產中提取賠償之要求，並建議各國佔領軍全體撒退。此舉若成事實，美國方面聞擬提出反建議，要求同時設立中央集權政府，授予相當實力，以免爲有組織之少數派所控制，並促成德國經濟統一，俾在數年內即有平衡預算之希望。</p>

<h3>撲朔迷離的一幕濟市仁豐紗廠發生重大糾葛</h3>
<p>〔本報濟甫三日航訊〕近週餘來，濟南市上發生了一件大事，由於這件大事與現任濟南市商會理事長馬伯聲爲「主角」，由罵理事長更牽涉到他所主持的濟市最大一家紗廠「仁豐紗廠」的「敵僞股權處理」和「接收問題」，於是內容也便益顯得複雜與微妙，不僅成了濟市各報本埠版的頭條新聞或花邊新聞，同時也成了所有「老鄉們」茶餘酒後最重要的叙談資料。事情的發生是仁豐紗廠前任副理姜子元在濟市誠報登了</p>
<p>一段啟事</p>
<p>大意是要仁豐紗廠執事（按即指馬伯聲）明白答復他；「十月十日由崔永和女士交付貴廠所開長盛公銀號十月七日照付第〇〇一五二四號支票一紙，計洋二千五百萬元，因不悉是何用途，未敢領受，除仍將支票妥爲保存外，特此露登報端，敬希於五日內明白賜復，以袪惶惑。」（節錄原文）道誠然如此間國民晚報所稱：「在現在的社會中，無數的人想要發財，以至企圖囤積暴利實汚而發財，這位姜先生竟見錢不要，也可算是在發財年月裹的一個奇聞。」而同樣耐人尋味的是這張支票係由濟市最有名的「淑女名媛」，現任綏區女秘書曁魯雀府女參議的崔永和女士經手，於是，消息也就不脛而走，引起了社會上對本問題的普遍注意。接着，十月二十六日濟南中報就首先登出了對崔女士的訪問記，據她說：「七七事變後，敵寇侵至洛口北岸，砲轟濟南時，仁豐紗廠即召集全體員工宣佈，時局危急，願回家者停薪留職，留廠守議者發雙薪，姜子元時任副理，也願意留。」「該支票二千五百萬元，是廠方給姜先生的守廠酬勞金。」（節錄原文）</p>
<p>五天日子很快地過去了，馬伯聲並未正式予姜子元答復，大家所看到的，只是十月二十九日在國民晚報上所披露的馬氏於同月六日「寫而未寄」的致姜氏的</p>
<p>一封回信</p>
<p>除縷述「……日敵佔據紗廠，同仁咸被驅逐，獨兄一人留廠，因此同仁有疑兄在敵人前從中播弄之嫌，乃掀起舊賬，以兄私吞廠內章邱棉款，濰縣布款，檢舉證據，將兄舉發，兄遂因此而出廠，兄每懐此事，未嘗不以舊同仁太無容忍之量，……故於去年中秋節而假以五百萬元，舊年節而濟以三百萬元，撫心自問，自覺無忝友道，不意吾兄不憚煩勞，要求無饜，今春又托苗海南兄仍借入百八十萬元，弟以無此力量，未能報命……」外，又述及姜向馬要朮復職，夫獲照准的經過，並旁及……」不意七月初旬，遍市發現「請看馬伯聲十大罪惡」的匿名傳單，內有數項特別註明，如有疑問，可問姜子元等語。……」（括符內皆節錄原文。）</p>
<p>究竟姜子元與馬伯聲之間鬧着什麼糾紛？內幕究竟如何？這僅是他倆的私事，至多是仁豐內部的糾葛，原不值得社會人士的普遍重視。但亦即由於</p>
<p>姜馬糾紛</p>
<p>的肇端，引起了有關國家權益，對仁豐紗廠「敵僞股權處理」和「接收問題。」據十月二十五日至記者捉筆寫本艾爲止，濟市各報載稱：　「勝利後爲全國上下痛心疾首之接收問題，頃將於此間面臨一重大考驗，即仁豐紗廠殷逆同所有股權之處理問題，就股逆戰前及淪陷期間，均任該廠總理，且擁有大批股權一事而論，該廠似未能遽予發還，即發還後對於股逆股權處理經過，亦應由關係當局與該廠廠方全部公諸社會，以釋疑寶，現該廠內部糾紛已因姜子元君拒絕接受馬伯聲交付兩千五百萬元一事而局部揭開。…」「頃獲悉，民國廿七年間，該廠經理馬伯聲奉總經理僞華北建設總署署長殷逆同之命，曾函濟南留廠人員，將若干小股股票合計十七萬五千元，照票面增加一成之代價，售予僞中國準備銀行，勝利後，此項已售予僞方之股權，據聞已彼一馬一靑（按係馬伯　之弟）者購得，究該馬某以</p>
<p>何種方式</p>
<p>，何種方法獲得此項股權，亦耐人尋味。…」「前於民國卅一年三月廿日，正值我神聖抗戰步入艱苦階段之際，仁豐紗廠總經理偽建設總署署長股逆同全權代表馬伯聲，在大明湖畔省立圖書館內，召開該廠股東會議，由馬任主席，並張貼全部董事名單，聲稱此係股署長在北京決定，不容更易，旋以紅綠票作形式上之選舉手續後，即由馬率領赴歷下亭，與日寇方面所派代表，　同在仁總紗廠由中日合資經營之合同上簽字，繼即攝影，並舉杯慶祝中日合作成功…。」「…仁豐股東某君對該廠經理馬伯聲並未向股東大會提出接受原始淸冊，及接受期間，傳設有大批布匹，以煤渣掩蓋，運出盜賣，亦未說明該事眞象，…表示朱盡滿意。…一「設逆同爲媚敵叛國，旣自動將仁豐紗廠與日寇合資經營之後，日寇乃以僞鈔一百八十萬元，交於該廠經理馬伯聲</p>
<p>全權分配　，當由馬作如下處理：　谷股東分配四十萬元，　全體職工分配一萬七千元，其餘一百三十八萬三千元，究作和用途，或係爲馬留用，迄今仍爲一謎。…」「…馬伯聲於日寇攻陷濟南前，早已潛往北平，當時絕不會受鬼子之威脅，其復返濟主持與日寇簽訂合同，實有通謀敵國構成漢奸之罪狀行爲，法院檢察官實應依法檢舉，何故仍任其逍遙法外？…」「…廿六年濟市淪陷後，該廠即爲敵人佔據，至廿七年馬一靑（馬伯聲之弟）突然返濟，向各股東聯絡，聲稱其兄（馬伯聲）以紗廠爲敵人佔有，全部財產均將損失一空，爲顧全權益計，已與殷逆同（該廠總經理）商酌，各股均按票額加一成出售，由偽準備銀行代收，當時共收到十七萬五千元，惟未說明買主爲誰，依據當時情形，可能係由殷逆同所收買，迄勝利後，馬伯聲即以殷同爲漢奸，其產業已成逆產，恐嚇</p>
<p>殷逆家族</p>
<p>將該股票收歸己有，其中一部贈與有力人士，另一部則因有二三有力股東，以當時出售不明，聲言，將訴之於法，馬氏爲求息事寗人計，亦分別贈予一部，惟爲數甚少，…本關當局可調查僞準備銀行存卷，買主究竟爲誰，疑案當不難冰釋。…」「…該廠董事會原定十月廿九日召開會議，以出席人數過少，僅由崔士傑（按係該廠現任董事長）召集到會之馬伯聲，張維緯，陳掄升，辛鑄九五人似私寓商討，由崔提出姜之復職問題，當經罵伯聲矢口拒絕，並聲言「有罵絕無姜」，後又提及敵僞時期殷逆同之三十萬元股票，已由本人證見轉與馬一靑名下，…至此，乃無結果而散。」（以上係節錄自濟市各報所載春秋社稿及誠報本報訊。）</p>
<p>由於濟市各報社發表了上面的消息，在十月卅一日各報社都接到了署名仁豐紗廠各部主任率全體職工二千五百人同啟，並有職工代表馬序德等卅七人具名蓋章的恐嚇信一件，新聞界爲自身安全計，經召開緊急會議後，當議決將原函轉呈防守司令部依法聲請保護。接着，本月一日中國回教協會山東分會負責人趙明遠等，招待濟市新聞界席上，馬伯聲嘗</p>
<p>避重就輕</p>
<p>除約略說明了擁有一萬八千錠子的仁豐紗廠自勝利接收後，在他主持下，已由日出紗一件，布七匹，增至今日的日出紗四十一件，布四百六十匹及抗戰期間「人家都跑向祖國的懷抱，我們這位老哥確跑到敵人佔據了的北平」（見十，廿五，國民晚報）的所以然的原因外，這到現在旣未見馬伯聲去函各報，要求更正，亦未見馬氏刊登啟事，聲明否認，於是事情也就愈使局外人撲朔迷離，高深莫測，除掉「都知道這問題所牽連的範圍很大，關係着一個大漢奸財產的被公分掩沒，和大股東「兼併」小股東，以及豪門巨商上下其手的重重內幕」外，詳細的情形，也只有正如春秋社所云；只有期待逮在洛陽業已對此事開始注意，在山東也打過幾隻「老虎」的豫魯監察使署郭監察使仲槐先生及有關方面的「澈查」和「辦理」了。（特派員　天）</p>

<h3>盲目者的靈敏聽覺</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>盲目的人，失掉了視覺，却有他種異常銳敏的感覺來補償。這是迭物者的賜予猶如聾啞的人，視覺特別靈敏一樣，盲目的人，具有銳敏的感覺中，以聽覺爲最。其次是兩手的手指，觸覺也特別靈敏。譬如用手指按摸各種物質的粗細，甚至布紋的粗細，紙張的厚薄，竟有用變手按模女子的面部而能知其美醜。寄乎不奇？</p>
<p>美基尼可夫氏（一九〇八年）會記述盲目的人，在地上步行之際，能够早前知道相當距離前面的障礙物之存在，因此可以巧妙地避免碰撞，氏稱他是第六感覺。據云「有一盲了四十年的老教授，獨個兒在公園中散步，從沒有碰撞一棵樹木或絆着一塊石頭。隔二公尺的距離，早就知道而預備避讓。有一天，他走進了一所從米進去過的大廈。室內中央，有一具大儀器存放着，他也能早就知道。另有一盲目者，在市街中步行的時候，竟能辨別商店或住宅。還能計算窗戶的數目」云。據美氏的理論說這些特別的感覺，是由於盲人的鼓膜作用。（還是靠他靈敏的聽覺）因爲他聽覺的敏銳，而能聽取微細的音響；當他步行的時候，從自身周圍物體表面反動而來的空氣振動，可以推測物體的存在。我們現在更知道夜間蝙蝠的飛行時，不致誤觸其他物件，也是這種理由。仕此次大戰中英國美國更利用這原理而發明了電波反射雷達，帮助了戰爭的勝利不少，豈非比盲目者的特別靈敏的感覺更奇而更妙呢？</p>
<h3>黑熱病</h3>
<p>— 儲麟蓀</p>
<p>黑熱病是一種慢性傳染病，有長期不規則發熱，肝脾腫大，白血球减少，貧血等主要症狀，很多的黑熱病通俗呌痞塊病，但痞塊病不一定就是黑熱病；因爲痞塊是症狀，不是黑熱病獨有的！有很多黑熱病彼人當作傷寒，瘧疾，癆病等來治療，這當然沒有好結果的，錯過了今日的醫學有辦法的時間性，慢慢兒的把病人拖延死了！這是什麼道理呢？難道這病在中國很少麼？不容易診斷麼？不！不！它是中國主要的流行病之一，每年送掉同胞很多的生命！損失了不可計數的國家生產力！</p>
<p>1903　Laveran和Mesnil氏爲紀念Leishmanng和Donovan兩氏對本病原的供獻，所以呌這寄生虫作Leishmania　donovanl它生存在病人的血管和淋巴管的內皮細胞中，脾，肝，骨髓中最多，在病人血液內的大單核白血球，大食細胞，或小便，大便，鼻粘膜，扁桃腺，唾液內也可以發現這病原體，傳染的媒介，以白蛉Phlebotomus最可能。</p>
<p>1875黑熱病在印度阿撒姆大流行，當時死亡很多，亞細亞，歐羅巴，阿非利加，西半球等地都有這病，特別是地中海沿岸各國，黑熟病在中國流行的歷史，一定很早。因爲臨床病徼的不詳絀，缺乏顯微鏡等檢查的設備，所以到1910年Aspland氏在中國第一個作確定的診斷後才被大家注意，最近三十多年，因病區的擴大，病人的增加，傳染媒介吸血白蛉的發現，和天然與實騐鞕毛型虫體的證明，於是，中國被認爲世界黑然病大流行區域之一，河北，河南，山東，安徽，江蘇除去很多的病例外，同時有傳染昆虫白蛉，和動物（六）保虫宿主的發見，確定是流行最烈的區域，抗戰以後，散在性的病例，幾遍全國，東北各省，甘肅，浙江，江蘇，江西，廣東，陕西，蘭州等地都有報吿，祗有人體病例，沒有傳染媒介和保虫宿主，不能認爲是流行區域，但是候寶障氏在四川灌縣與理番之問，檢得病例和傳染媒介的白蛉，所以四川有成爲流行區域的可能，去年蘇北大批難民渡江南來，其中生黑熱病的不知多少，假使京滬一帶也有白蛉的繁殖和傳播，那麼，數年後，江南必定成爲不可收集的黑熱病魔行區域。</p>
<p>這病爲什麽要被人錯過呢？因爲症候不特別顯明，不是單獨用眼睛看着，耳朵聽聽，檢查病人的脈息和舌苔便能斷定是什麼病，從傳染到發病時的潛伏期大約十天到三四個月，外表面沒有什麼現象，從此以後發弛張式或間歇式的寒熱，有頭痛，嘔吐等的自覺症狀，二十四小時內的體溫可以有二次或三次的高潮，整個的熱度經過是不規則的，在這時期，白血球减少，貧血，心臟衰弱，有時也有像風濕性的關節有時發輕度持續熟，五個月後，漸漸發現脾肝腫大，腹部膨滿，脾臟往往很大，手摸時有一個大這時病人形容憔悴，骨搜如柴；皮膚顏色漸漸變得深了，好像黑的樣子，因爲皮膚顏色深，有寒熱，所以呌作黑熱病，足背浮腫，水臌脹，皮膚黏膜容易出血，大便好像痢疾，經過半年或一二年，因衰弱過度死了！或因生結核，敗血病，肺炎等而死了！</p>
<p>它的經過要這樣長的時間，沒有一個特別的，拿得住的症狀，可以斷定病人一定是生黑熱病，你想，不經過確實的診斷手續，怎樣能不弄錯呢？它起初邊熱，發熱的病多得很呢！脾肝腫大，白血球减少，都不是道病所獨有的，所以我們必定要把它從其他可以發熱，可以使肝脾腫大等的病羣中，例如：傷寒，瘧疾，波動熱，阿米巴性肝　瘍，腸結核，Hodgking氏病，Banti氏病，白血病，幼兒胆汁性肝硬化，日本住血吸蟲病等等區別出來，方才可以對症下藥，挽救病人的生命，這也沒有什麼困難，假使你肯聽　師的話，讓我們做下面的幾個檢查：一·血片　株標本·二·血培養，三·脾臟穿刺，四·肝臟穿刺，五·胸骨穿刺，六·脛骨穿刺，七·淋巴腺穿刺，八·Napien氏Aldehyd試驗，九·銻素試驗，十·球蛋白沉降試驗，十一·凝集試驗。</p>
<p>上面寫了這許多試驗，你讀了怕危險麼？怕麻煩麼？不要怕！假使你要醫師給你一個確實的診斷，有效的治療～那麼，你得感謝醫師，爲你費了寶貴的時間，做詳細而準確的檢查，救了病人的生命！增加了家庭的幸福！</p>
<h3>用麻醉劑割治頸部（續）病症發生意外之實例</h3>
<p>— 梁俊靑</p>
<p>病者呼吸正常，肺部微有氣枝管肺炎症象。此時之診斷爲：後咽部蜂窠織炎癥　患枝管肺炎。療治方法：由雷蒂敎授親自主持後咽部之蜂窠織炎割治術。手術前半小時先用002之嗎啡及柯突羅平注射。因患者兼有氣枝管肺炎之故，對於麻醉方法曾經詳細之討論與研究。最後決定用危險性較少之Narconumal　靜脈注方法。此種麻醉方法由最有經騐之助手醫師主持，每分鐘只注射一西西。經過注射上藥六西西後病者開始計算糢糊（即神志已然不甚淸楚）。於八西西後病者入於深睡，不能答覆旁人之詢問。於是再加注射三西西。隨即試用一種特製之壓舌器（名Vegus可壓舌又可作爲撑開口腔之用，同時又可將以脫（Aether）輸入作爲麻醉之用），然未成功，蓋其牙關緊閉無法插入也。復繼注射一西西上述之靜脈麻醉劑亦無效。於是佐以脫之點滴麻醉法四十西西，此時牙　已鬆。於是設法插人上述之壓舌器。詎料此時病者忽然呼吸非常困難。病者微作數度之輕微呼吸即行停止呼吸。惟以治手術初不因呼吸停止而中止。共後咽壁之蜂窠織炎腫漲處立即開割，計自左側之帶形隆起處往下割開直至氣管門左下角爲止。此時排出惡臭之膿液甚多。人工呼吸亦同時舉行。此呼吸停止之病者脈搏初尚平穩而充實，惟約在十分鐘後則心贓亦停止跳動。於是注射一西西Adrenalin於病者心臟內。約在三分鐘後則心臟又復跳動。惟其呼吸依然停止，雖然已經爲其注射刺激呼吸劑與强心劑亦不爲功（Lobelin＆Coramin）。於是不斷用人工呼吸呼救助。病者於停止呼吸廿分鐘後，方始回復其第一次呼吸，再等一分鐘後方始有第二次呼吸。然後於十分鐘內其呼吸方始逐漸回復其正常狀態。惟病者於一小時後又復呼吸急促，繼之則昏睡如死。此時氣管門忽然發生水腫狀態，於是爲此開割喉管。自橋入喉管之後其呼吸方始改善，然而病者始終昏睡未醒。翌日，即八月十一日，病者雖經各種強心劑之救助始終香睡未醒。有呼吸　　，然而正常。惟病者全身逐漸僵硬，有時角弓反張，足尖向後緊抽。其狀宛如腦袋已被割去之人。病者在開刀卅五小時後死亡。</p>
<p>屍體解剖報吿。檢驗人爲瑞士京城伯爾大學病理院長魏階玲教授（Prof　Wegelin）。咽喉：兩扁桃腺微有擴大，頗有褶凹狀態而帶紅腫。其咽喉後壁之近中綫處有一手術傷口，自扁桃腺下端直向下至近脊柱處爲止。其後咽部位完全變厚，大部份已經腐爛，壞疽，惡臭，蔓延至肺尖爲止。此外其壞疽之病灶且蔓延至於甲狀腺之枝葉，其甲狀態之上端已有二生的米突大小之病灶，且大部已經腐爛。至於氣枝管方面，則有水腫狀態而已。其他固仍正常也。其左側之頸部大靜脈已經結紮。騐得並無血栓現象。其頸部之淋巴腺核亦有一生的左右之大小，惟捫之則甚軟。組織學方面之醫學檢查報吿：左側扁桃腺有顯明之出血狀態。左側扁桃腺後之結締組織有高度之水腫，間亦有出血現象，並雜以白血球，淋巴血球，以及成形細胞（Plasmazcllen）。其後咽部　瘍抽取物之抹片檢查報告；有無數微細之格蘭氏陽性反應之變形球菌，此外亦有鈍形之格蘭姆氏球菌，以及杆狀菌，少許之格蘭姆氏陰性之桿狀菌等。大腦部份：硬腦膜繃緊，變厚而不透明。腦賓內有流動性血液，血塊及紮色血斑。軟腦膜亦繃緊。蛛網膜積血，腦靑髓液澄淸，亦未增加。間腦下埀腺及松菓腺正常。腦底血管鐵細。腦重一千三百格蘭。腦紋平坦，凹縫變狹。腦腔闊度正常，神經叢亦正常。腦質潤濕，有相當之溢血狀態。組織學方面檢查報告：所有血管皆已擴大，充塞血液。血管壁外層水腫。硬腦膜水腫性變化甚劇，且有多量血液　積。腦部本質及包皮無變化。屍體解剖診斷結果：「病者有後咽部蜂窠　炎，兼左側之甲狀腺炎。附帶病症爲扁桃腺炎，肺氣腫，肺水腫，大葉性肺炎，卡他兒性氣管枝炎，急性脾臟腫大，肝臟起脂肪變質，心臟外膜溢血，腸胃黏膜全部溢血，急性腦　腫漲，軟腦膜充血。肝臟與腎臟變質，糢糊性腫大」。</p>
<p>上述案件經過屍體解剖檢查明瞭其原因即吿一段落未被控訴。而原文作者葛拉芙氏則發表意見如下：</p>
<p>此案之足供吾人外科醫師以及耳鼻喉科醫師特別注意者乃爲施行麻醉期中之呼吸中斷，董在靜脈注射之全身麻醉時期中尙未開始割治後咽部之蜂窠織炎，而忽然發生呼吸停止狀態，不能不令再三考慮耳。當然，靜脈注射麻醉劑之主持者旣爲有經驗之助手醫師，吾人不能懷疑其技術方面有若何錯誤。吾人所可注意者，則爲正當特種壓舌器放入口腔內之一煞那間，忽然呼吸停止。此何故歟？斯實有待於吾人之研究者。蓋吾人習知，在割治扁桃腺腫大症時吾人往往於麻醉期中用此種特製之壓舌器置於病者口腔內，亦可能遇有上述之呼吸突然停止情形，（尤其於壓舌器插入於口腔內將舌頭及整個下巴向下緊壓時最易發生）。因此吾人對於先用口罩式之以脫吸入法麻醉病者再欲改用特製壓舌器之以脫壓入法議續麻醉病者時則須特別留意，以期避免種種不如意之困難，蓋此時之呼吸容易發生困難甚或突然中止也。根據此種事實方面之觀察，吾人深覺用壓舌器緊壓舌根及口腔下巴之後必定有一種刺激呼吸神經中樞突然停止工作之反射作用發生。吾人又知，有許多可以促使呼吸神經中樞忽然停止工作之反射地界，例如　上部呼吸器官之黏膜，即爲發生反射作用之地界。吾人刺激鼻腔之黏膜，即可發生上述之情形。（以電流刺激兔子之鼻腔粘膜可以立即使呼吸停止）。又如刺激咽喉，氣管門以及大氣管等處亦然。　因痛楚過渡亦可發生呼吸停止。　用高速度聲音或刺激耳部神經中樞亦然。　用熱力刺激皮膚亦然。　若自動神經感受刺激，亦可發生上述情形。</p>

<h3>謬賞</h3>
<p>— 流雲</p>
<p>仇池筆記載：「予昔在歧下，聞河屬猪肉至美，使人往致之，使者醉，猪夜逸’買他猪以進，吾不知也。客皆大詫以爲非他產所及；已而事敗，客皆大慚」！讀完此一故事，不禁感慨萬千！「買他猪以進，吾不知也」。固然，「君子可欺其以方」。但是「客皆大詫以爲非他產所及。」那就眞個口中有鬼了。戳穿來說，還不是澈底的盲從附和阿觀取客的劣根性在作祟，以泯其良知的麼？　子才請；「知己難，知味尤難」！可見古往今來眞正知味的解人就不多。這次「大詫以爲非他產所及」的秘密倘不被揭破，大家還要躊躇滿志，以爲眞正的嚐到了河陽的美猪肉，朶頤大快，向人將詡自　。一且眞相畢露，於是大家都弄得不好意思而臉爲之大紅，夭下類此的事正多着呢！但我以爲「事敗」猶知「大慚」，總算還有一個「良知」與「善惡之心」的存在，最怕的是恬不知恥，臉都不會紅一下，那就「哀英大於心死」而不可救藥了。自由談人物誌記約翰·韋南特</p>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>美國前任駐英大使約翰·韋南特，三日晚在紐漢浦歇州康科城寓所突然以手槍自殺。在其自殺之前，正將所著「使英回憶錄」全部脫稿。據法醫判斷，恐係長期渦度疲勞，神經失常所致。</p>
<p>留意國際時局的人，總記得這位卓越的美國外交官罷，他在德機轟炸倫敦最猛烈的時候，出任駐英大使，對增强盟國間的聯系，及軍事經濟上的種種援助，有過極大的貢獻。此外，他三度任職紐漢浦歇州的州長時，舉辦的社會福利事業及提倡年老補助制，緊急救難等條例，也至今爲美國人士所稱道。</p>
<p>以外表而論，韋氏面貌身材都酷似林肯，身材高大，雙目奕奕有神，甚至性情脾氣都很相像，誠懇，熟心，不修邊幅。頭髮永遠亂蓬蓬的，襯衫皺得不堪，褲子也從來不想燙。在使英任內，倫敦的廣播電台時常廣播道位合眾國的大使是如何的落拓不羈，不合紳士風度。韋氏的母親在美國聽到這事，連忙打常話間他的媳婦：「他沒有帶去新襯衫麼？」　氏夫人悵悵地說：「帶得很多，但是，你也知道，他一定忘記更換　！有什麼辦法！」</p>
<p>韋南特總是專心於他的工作，根本就不善交際，在倫敦也不大出現於社交塲所。他喜歡一個兒關在辦公室裏，把上衣提在手裏，低下頭踱來踱去沉思着某一個急待解決的問題。等他把問題想通了後，他的上衣也一定掉在地板上，被踐踏得不成樣子了。他就是這樣的忙於工作，每天從淸晨直到深夜，而且沒有假期。如果說他這次自殺的確是爲了平時工作過度，神經失常所致，也並非沒有根據。</p>
<p>韋氏出身美國「豪門」，家襄很有錢，在聖保羅學校担任過歷史教授，第一次歐戰後和普林斯敦富有的羅　爾女士結婚，婚後專心仕途。大家譏笑他這麼一側書呆子，「進步派」份子，况且又發了妻財的傢伙，還能幹什麼事業，但是他毫不介意，悍然參加議員競選。</p>
<p>他口才奇劣，聲調極慢。在競選期間，第一次發表潰說的時候，上了台竟囁囁嚅　一個字都說不出來，氣得他的太太當塲昏厥了過去，但是聽眾都爲他的老實而偌服，他的競選勝利了。</p>
<p>他的外表無論如何策抽，他的懇　的精神自會發出光芒，與他接觸過的人都擁獲他，他一迎了三次紐漢浦歇州的州長，與他任　選的人，如前海軍部長諾克斯等，都望塵莫及。</p>
<p>他受擁護的另一個原因，是喜歡接近民眾。任何人可以　到他的辦公室中，和他談上兩個鐘點，他會把公務統統躭　起來。而且他喜歡帮助人家，一次他以州長資格出席紐約一個重要會議，在到車站去的路上，一個襤褸的女人向他討錢，他把口袋裏所有的錢都給了他。到了車站，發貿自己連買火車票的錢都沒有了，反而向一個不相識的人去借錢。</p>
<p>紐漢浦歇州的人曾這樣說：「假使州長請你吃飯，你一定要帶錢去，然後借給他，讓他會鈔。」——韋南特就是這樣的一個人。</p>
<p>他個人雖不能理財，但在州長任內，却能改革財政，採用最新預算制度，成績斐然。</p>
<p>他也担任過社會安全局長，及日內瓦國際勞工指導員。當英德戰事緊張時，由羅斯福總統特任他出使英倫。戰事結束時，曾充歐洲監察委員會美國代表，今年又由杜魯門任命爲聯合國經濟社會理事會常任代表，今年五十八歲。</p>
<p>韋南特的自殺，是否確如法醫所判斷困神經失常所致，還是基於其他原因，目前當然無法臆測，但對於這麼一個不凡的政治家的死，總是覺得非常惋惜的。</p>
<h3>鷄呌子</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>公雞生蛋，屢見報載。</p>
<p>女變成男男變女，據言手術都能作，不知敝國更文明，屢見雄雞能產卵！</p>
<p>時代而今都反了，任何事物成顚倒，陰陽怪氣滿人間，恐少雞鳴多狗盜！</p>
<h3>故都的秋天</h3>
<p>— 沙藍</p>
<p>秋深了，這使我更加懷念故都了。一年四季，唯有秋天是北平最好的時光，春日多狂風，夏季大陸性的炎熱，以及冬天的嚴寒都不是理想的天氣。但秋日則秋高氣爽，此起江南每逢此時的苦雨要舒服得多了。而秋季正是百物成熟的季節，花生，栗子，柿子，白薯都是旣經濟又美味的食品，同時，立秋過後，可以暢開兒大　烤肉，一快來頤，這種風味是除北平以外不能享受到的。至自備支子，携到香山，檢松枝來烤肉吃，更是能有山林的趣味。</p>
<p>勝芳的肥蟹，也是引人思想之物，早在江南洋澄湖大蟹展覽於街頭之先，西　或東單菜市早就陳列「橫行公子」了。自然，以經濟的眼光論，到前門西河沿去買是最最上算的。</p>
<p>南方人好以桂樹眩關於北方，實際桂樹除掉氣味芬芳樸鼻外，並無觀賞的價值，秋季植物中，總還是菊花較勝一籌。故都的菊，不必說，朱自淸光生的一篇「淸華園之菊」早已膾炙人口，除淸華而外，公園，國立北平圖書館的菊花，也很名貴，珍品甚多。公園春日的「看牡丹」與狄天的「賞菊花」，同是當時的行樂事。只是目前丘荒馬亂，大家憂「高高頭」之不及，恐怕有此雅興的人也不多了。</p>
<p>話又說回來，當白雲高高地飄蕩着，蔚藍色的天空百分之百保證你絕無風雨之患時，身上穿的也正是夾衫，旣不嫌冷，又不覺得熱，這時候，你難道絕不想出外溜溜嗎？近則公園北海，遠則天壇頤和園，假如有詩情畫意的話，傑作就會產生了。最不濟，也可以在自己庭園中，閑蕩關蕩，不能創造，也可以就記憶所及，吟哦朗誦，一滌憂慮的。然而在上海，這種　氣就難得享受了，望上瞧是高樓大廈，望下瞧，是擁擠的人羣，不必說，靈感也飛散了，詩興也平就逃之夭夭了。啊，這是都市人的苦悶。</p>
<h3>說栗</h3>
<p>— 殊晌</p>
<p>炎栗二物，都是北方的果品，北地產者較小，但味甘勝於他處，栗子在北方，以昌平，歷城，鄒平三縣出產較多，現在最著名者，爲良鄕栗子。浙江省產栗亦不少，詺曁，臨海，東陽，龍泉四縣最多，論味終不及北方數縣所產，這大槪是土壤不同的緣故。</p>
<p>在重慶時，曾吃到靑城山的灭師栗，外形與普通栗一樣，惟一房一實，吃起來味絕甘美。天師栗衹有靑城山生產，他處絕無，相傳是張天師學道時的這種，每年出產甚少，祗有在重慶漲縣一帶的人，才吃得到。</p>
<p>要種栗，須等栗子初熟出壳時，即緊裹埋濕土中，勿令見風，見風即不出芽，到明年三月間，栗子始露芽萌生，稍長再遷種他處，數年內勿用掌相浸，每年十月間，須用草緊裹，至二月始解。栗子是北方樹，但還是非常畏寒的。</p>
<p>栗子與橄攬薄切成片，拌和同吃時，風味絕美。人稱「梅花脯」。山藥用栗子同切成片，再以羊汁加料合煮，名稱「金玉羹」，也是一件秋末冬初的美味。</p>
<p>栗子最大者，稱板栗，次爲山栗，像山栗圓而頭尖者稱錐栗，圓小　橡子的稱莘栗，小至如指頭的爲茅栗，一栗之微，種類竟多至如此。</p>
<p>栗子補腎，腰脚無力的人，每晨吃風乾栗子十餘顆，再吃猪腎粥二碗，半月後即可見效。蘇東坡的弟弟蘇子由就吃這種補品，一邊還做詩稱：「老去自添腰腳病，山翁服栗舊傳方，客來爲說晨與晚，三咽徐收白玉漿」。這是吃栗子的聖手。</p>
<p>同皇帝狎嬉，全憑口才，梁史蕭琛傳載稱：「梁武帝在西邸，與琛有舊，帝每朝宴接，琛以舊恩，常經預御筵，醉伏，上以炎投琛，琛乃取栗擲上，正中面，御史中丞在座，帝動色曰：此中有人，不得如此，豈有說耶？琛即答曰：陛下投臣以赤心，臣敢不報以戰栗，武帝始笑悅」。這可見口才的要緊。</p>

<p>變卿女史，才不可量，余曾錄其通篇疊字的「鳳凰臺上憶吹簫」一詞，可見一斑，茲再錄其每句有「春」字的餉耕詞一關，妍麗大方，毫無牽强，洞云：</p>
<p>「紫陌春晴，慢額裹春紗，自餉春耕，小梅春瘦，細草春明，春田步步春生；記那年春好向春燕，說破春情，到於今，想春箋春淚，都化春冰。憐春痛春春幾，被一片春烟，鎖住春驚，贈與春懐，遞將春你，是儂是你春靈，算春頭春尾，也難算春夢春醒，甚春魔，做一春春病，春誤雙卿」。</p>
<p>計通篇僅一百零四字，分爲二十二句，而用二十九個「春」字，「春」愼從天上來也。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯揭露：四強外交秘密</h3>
<p>— 珊</p>
<p>七月二日，陸軍部長史汀生，以具有卓見的備忘錄咨呈總統，爲向日提文的張本。總統根據此種忘錄，就起草美，英，中三國的聯合宣言。總統和我曾一再斟酌，邱吉爾首相的若干建議亦經採納。這個邱吉爾所同意的宣言，除了關於日皇將來的地位問題沒有涉及之外，其綱要即係根據史汀生部長的建議。這個提議式的宣言，就送給蔣介石氏簽署。</p>
<p>未幾邱吉爾，文德禮二氏返英，杜魯門總統也利用這個機會，往法蘭克福的美軍佔領區總司令部，我也隨着同去。當我們返抵「小白宮」的那一晚，有兩件電訊等着總統。一件是威耐　大使報吿邱吉爾競選失敗的驚奇消息，第二件是蔣介石元帥認可那現在稱爲蒞資坦的宣言。這宣言就立刻發表公布，並以一份由專差遣送給莫洛托夫先生。</p>
<p>當晚深夜，莫洛托夫氏來電話，要求把這宣言壓置二三天，常吿訴他說這宣言已經宣佈時，他似乎煩惱了。第二天，我解釋給他聽，在這宣言發表之前，所以未曾送給他過目者，因爲我們不要叫蘇聯由於向猶未對之作戰的國家，提出宣言，而感覺困難。他沒有說，他希望有所修改，不還單純地說，我們總得先和他商量一下呢。</p>
<p>兩天之後，七月二十九日，莫洛托夫先生再來訪唔。原來商決，總統及我將和他並史達林元帥相見，但莫氏告訴我們，史達林那天是病了。他敎莫洛托夫光生和我們討論蘇聯參戰的直接原因。莫氏說：蘇聯政府以爲，最好由美，英，和其他聯合國家，向蘇聯提出參戰的正式請求。他補充說，蘇聯政府當然以爲在參戰之前，應先和中國政府締約。</p>
<p>這個請求對我們便是個問題了。蘇聯已與日本締有不侵犯條約，蘇聯政府又曾與希特勒訂有同樣條約，但是破壞這個條約的是納粹黨。我們不信美國政府在沒有良好和充份理由之下，應該要求其他政府去違反協定。蘇聯業已於幾個月前通知日木，對此約不擬續訂，但是有效的期間，還近乎近一年。總統對此覺得煩惱。</p>

<h3>讀者信箱　華僑存欵應如何償還？</h3>
<p>編者先生：　載戰前存款償還辦法，業經國務會議通過，將於本月七日立法院完成立法手續後公佈施行。但對太平洋戰事發生前華僑用外匯折合法幣的存款，未獲擬定優待辦法償還，深爲詫異。筆者以華僑新聞界的立楊，除分呈各有關機關首長外，謹借貴報寶貴的園地，爲我海外僑胞吐口受屈損失的寃氣。</p>
<p>抗戰期問，華僑源源接濟外匯，支持中央政府，並發動大規模籌賑義捐，及踴躍承銷救國公債，忠黨愛國精神，掬誠表現無遺。</p>
<p>太平洋戰爭以前，新加坡山國銀行會　次向僑胞呼籲，請用英幣折國幣存款，藉以充實國庫，而增抗戰力量，並聲言保本厚忠，決負信託責任。當時僑胞激於愛國熱忱，一面除節衣縮食慨助義捐以外，一面又將原儲養在外國銀行的款項，移存中國銀行折合爲國幣，更有許多是變賣一部份產業才來儲蓄的，爲了他們對於政府的信用，深具萬分信心的緣故。</p>
<p>太平洋戰事甫吿發生，南洋各島隨即相繼淪陷，市行匆皇撤退，所有華僑存款便被凍結至今了。</p>
<p>根據上述情形，政府口口聲聲愛護華僑，今後唯有祈待事實的表現，我們的要求很簡單，請政府體恤華僑過去用外匯折存國幣的衷誠，依照原來外匯數額無息償還，（民廿九卅年每千元國幣存款，約合美金二百元）如目前外匯頭寸拮据，亦應另定法幣特別倍數償還的辦法，因爲這些存款裹而，大部份是普通僑民在異邦做牛做馬，多年用血用汗換來僅有一點的橋蓄。中國銀行更須善守諾言，才不被認爲一種可怕的　局。</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以後，所謂華僑復員的資金，雖然結果空雷無謂，但因我們同情國家經濟的苦難，從來未敢輕發半句怨嘆，惟有此種存款若披無形全數的撥吞，我們是將發動請願抗議了，並請全國與論界主持公道。臨書懇切，議致敬禮！南洋各屬華僑籌賊總書執委。新加坡星洲日報，香港星島日報，駐京滬特派員李君俠謹上，十一月三日。</p>

<h3>List of Kuomintang Candidates Submitted to the Election Headquarters for Thorough Night Review; Committee Members of Election Offices Nominated by Political Parties to be Removed; Lists from the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party Still Awaiting Further Discussion</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] Due to disagreements from the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party regarding the quota of National Assembly candidate lists nominated by political parties after review, further discussions are pending. The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee will hold a temporary meeting on the afternoon of the 7th to discuss this matter.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Kuomintang's list of National Assembly candidates nominated by political parties, totaling approximately one thousand names, was delivered to the Election Headquarters at 3:00 AM on the 6th. The Election Headquarters has been working diligently on reviewing and proofreading the list throughout the day. As of midnight, the work is still not completed.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Zhang Lisheng told Central News Agency reporters on the evening of the 6th that the General Office is currently carefully considering the fact that many of the over ten thousand election committee members at all levels of election offices across the country have been nominated by political parties. According to election laws, these candidates are not allowed to participate in the election. Therefore, they should be removed in accordance with the review procedures. This work is expected to be completed by the 7th. Once the lists of candidates submitted by the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party are delivered to the Election Headquarters and reviewed, they will be announced together.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Rumors that the list of Kuomintang National Assembly candidates will be finalized by President Chiang are absolutely untrue. However, the list of Kuomintang comrades holding important military and political responsibilities at the central and local levels has been submitted by the Central Party Headquarters to the President for approval. It is heard that the President hopes that those comrades responsible for military and political affairs at the central and local levels, except for those who are necessary, will not participate in the National Assembly election so as to give way to other individuals.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the Election Headquarters Committee, stated: The list nominated by the Kuomintang is based on the principle of "The world is for all; elect the virtuous and capable." It not only includes Kuomintang members but also recommends virtuous individuals from outside the party.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The original quota of National Assembly candidates nominated by the China Youth Party was 300, and 209 have been approved after review. The original quota of the Democratic Socialist Party was 260, and currently, over 190 have been approved after review, which is far from what the two parties requested. On the morning of the 6th, Wu Tiecheng and Chen Lifu of the Kuomintang successively invited members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party to meet and handed over the reviewed lists. Members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party believed that the reviewed lists needed further consideration and handed the reviewed lists to their respective parties for discussion before making a decision. Xu Chuanlin and Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party flew to Shanghai yesterday afternoon and immediately convened an emergency Central Standing Committee meeting. The meeting continued until 9:00 PM, and it was decided that Xu and Jiang would return to Nanjing on the morning of the 7th to further negotiate with Kuomintang representatives. The China Youth Party has also sent the original list back to the Kuomintang and proposed four points, hoping they can be addressed:  Important figures of the party should be included in the list.  Some of those listed as alternates should be changed to official candidates.  Some of those listed as elected in certain areas should be elected in other areas.  Some unimportant figures who have been nominated should be removed. The government is very concerned about this, as any changes to the China Youth Party's list will inevitably affect the Kuomintang's already decided list.</p>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Control Yuan's morning discussion meeting on the 6th also touched upon the election issue. Some Control Yuan members believed that those who had previously held positions in the puppet regime should not be allowed to mingle among the various candidates. If found, they should be reported according to the law. This was made as a suggestion, and it was signed by over 20 Control Yuan members.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 6th] The list of National Assembly candidates from the interior of Gansu Province, with its unique customs, and the Tibetan areas was announced by the Provincial Election Office on the morning of the 6th. The former includes Yu Zhengxi, Wu Jiuru, Gu Xixian, Leng Faxiu, Ma Gelin, and Ma Fulin, while the latter includes Kong Jizhou, Suo Zangfo, Lei Zhaoxiang, and Yang Shenghua.</p>
<h3>Molotov Warns the United States that the Atomic Bomb Holds No Secrets; Claims the Soviet Union is Determined to Fight for Peace</h3>
<p>[Report from our Agency] London, 6th Broadcast: Moscow News, Today marks the 30th anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution. Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech stating that the secrets of the atomic bomb no longer exist, and it is an illusion for the United States to try to exert influence through the atomic bomb. The audience erupted in cheers. Molotov also stated that what the Soviet Union values most is ensuring peace. Peace-loving people in all countries of the world can be sure that the Soviet Union will fight for peace to the end. He cited Stalin's conversation with Stettinius, in which the Soviet leader strongly argued that two different economic systems can cooperate and coexist peacefully. However, he said, "In our era, all roads lead to communism." Molotov also heavily criticized American imperialism and issued a subtle warning. He said that aggressive imperialism is the crisis of capitalism, and although it may not be easily noticed by the general public, it will eventually suffer the consequences as time goes on. Molotov then praised the Communist International Information Bureau established in the capital of Yugoslavia and hailed the success of the October Revolution, indicating that capitalism has approached its end. As for Molotov's claim that the secrets of the atomic bomb no longer exist, it is a new statement from Soviet leaders. Previously, the Soviet side often accused the United States of trying to monopolize the secrets of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>[Report from our Agency] New York, 6th Broadcast: Lake Success News, Molotov's claim that the secrets of the atomic bomb no longer exist has caused speculation among representatives of various countries in the United Nations. Some believe that this statement is not new, while others believe that the United States is at least 15 years ahead of the Soviet Union in atomic bomb manufacturing. Molotov's speech is like a timid child walking through a graveyard, whistling loudly to embolden himself.</p>
<h3>Marshall Still Unwilling to Express U.S. Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 5th] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference on the 4th that he is considering the entire China issue, but reiterated his refusal to release the Wedemeyer Report. When asked why the report remains secret, Marshall replied that it was due to the reasons he had already announced. He said that he himself did not feel it was necessary to release it or publish everything he and the President had discussed. When asked if the final publication of the report would include a summary of the United States' ability to assist China, he said that he did not wish to comment on this. Marshall also refused to comment on whether China was included in the world development plan, such as the Marshall Plan. However, he said that he could not specify whether any aid to China was separate from other aid.</p>
<h3>Judicial Review Conference Forms Groups to Review Proposals</h3>

<h3>Council of State Affairs Committee to Hold Routine Meeting Today; Foreign Minister Wang to Report</h3>

<h3>Zhang Lan's Statement Expresses Hope that Members Will Abide by the Law</h3>
<p>[Report from our Agency] Zhang Lan, former Chairman of the China Democratic League, issued the following written statement yesterday: "I have reluctantly and painfully notified all members of the China Democratic League on November 6th to cease political activities and announced the dissolution of the League's headquarters. However, my personal belief in the peace, democracy, unity, and solidarity of the country, and my determination to work towards this goal, will never change. I hope that all former members will stand on the position of loyal citizens, abide by the law, and continue to work towards the peace, democracy, unity, and solidarity of the country in order to achieve our goals."</p>
<h3>Chairman Sends Special Telegram of Congratulations on Soviet Revolution Anniversary</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] Diplomatic sources: November 7th is the anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution. Chairman Chiang has sent a telegram to Nikolai Shvernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, to offer his congratulations. The original text is as follows: "On the joyous occasion of your country's National Day, I, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extend to Your Excellency my sincere congratulations and wish Your Excellency good health and the people of your country prosperity and happiness. Chiang Kai-shek."</p>
<h3>The Board of Directors of the Four Banks Joint Administration Approves Increased Provincial Ordinary Agricultural Loans and Approves Many Loan Cases</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] The Four Banks Joint Administration held its 356th board meeting on the morning of the 6th, chaired by Zhang Qun. The following important cases were approved:  To assist in strengthening transportation, eight working capital loans were approved for the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, the Longhai Railway, the Capital Power Plant, and the Chongqing Public Bus Company.  To assist in enhancing industrial and mining production, over twenty working capital loans were approved, including loans for the Resources Commission to purchase Yunnan tin, the Guangdong Shunde Sugar Factory, the Shanghai Tianli Liquefied Gas Plant, the Qingdao Tongtai Rubber Factory, and the Sichuan Agricultural Manufacturing Company.  To purchase domestically produced cotton for various yarn factories in port areas, foreign exchange will be used to handle the transaction. The loans involve seven yarn factories, including Shanghai Gongyong, Dafeng, Dasheng, Shenxin, Xinhe, Yong'an, Qinghuang Xinhua, Wuxi Lixin, Chongqing Yu, and Changzhou Min.  To assist in the transport and sale of rice to stabilize food prices, seventeen loans for assessing goods in various areas of Sichuan and Huai were approved. In addition, ordinary agricultural loans for various provinces were increased due to the original quotas being insufficient. The provinces include Sui, Lu, Qian, Yu, Jin, Yi, Shan, Cha, Gan, Su, Gui, Yue, Min, Gan, Zhe, E, Xiang, Dian, Chuan, and Kang, totaling twenty provinces.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders Banks and Treasuries to Pay Attention to the Use of Loans</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] Regarding Control Yuan member Li Shijun's suggestion to suspend commercial loans and to relax restrictions on industrial loans while strengthening auditing and supervision, the Ministry of Finance stated that "The main purpose of production loans provided by national banks and treasuries is to increase production, stabilize prices, facilitate the flow of goods, and promote exports. Therefore, loans have been granted to industries that produce and sell daily necessities, basic industries, export trade, and transportation services, in accordance with government economic policies and the actual needs of each industry. Ordinary commercial loans have already been suspended by various banks and treasuries. In addition, great importance is attached to the assessment of loan usage. In addition to the regular supervision by personnel from the lending banks and treasuries, the Four Banks Joint Administration also sends auditors to various regions to conduct confidential investigations to ensure that loans are used properly and effectively to aid production. In cases where a small number of loans do not comply with regulations, the lending banks and treasuries are notified to strictly rectify the situation or recover the loans. The use of borrowed funds by loan recipient companies to purchase raw materials cannot be without any impact on prices. However, it does not seem to be a fact that the influx of idle capital and the prevalence of speculation are caused by loans. The government has already paid attention to and implemented Control Yuan member Li's suggestions, and it will strictly order various banks and treasuries to comply with government policies and relevant regulations in the future."</p>
<h3>There are No Plans to Move Factories in the Northeast and North China Southward</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan Replies to the Shenyang Provisional Consultative Council</p>
<p>[Report from our Shenyang Office, 6th] The Shenyang Provisional Consultative Council sent a letter to the central government last month requesting that the plan to dismantle and transport production equipment in the Northeast and North China that cannot currently operate southward be stopped. The Executive Yuan specifically replied to the Shenyang Municipal Government to be forwarded to the Provisional Consultative Council, stating that "According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has established industry and commerce guidance offices in Shenyang and Tianjin to promote the active production of operating factories in the private sector in the Northeast and North China and to resume operations as soon as possible for those that are not yet operating. There are no plans to move factories southward." It is understood that this may have been caused by a misunderstanding arising from the Resources Commission and other institutions' plans to move abandoned small motor machinery from here southward for use.</p>
<p>[Report from our Shenyang Office, 6th] Chen Cheng convened responsible persons from various Northeast industrial and mining units of the Resources Commission on the night of the 5th to discuss the current crisis in Northeast industry and mining. It is reported that many advocated stabilizing coal production first to ensure that thermal power generation and fuel are not lacking in order to revive industry and mining, followed by transportation and other sectors.</p>
<h3>The Philippines Refuses Entry to Compatriots from Taiwan, Enraging Overseas Chinese Groups; The Manila Daily Bulletin Publishes Absurd Theories Again</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 5th] According to news from evening newspapers here, the Philippine government has rejected China's request to authorize the American consulate in Taiwan to issue passports to overseas Chinese from Taiwan who wish to enter the Philippines. According to the Philippine side, this is because, before the post-war status of the people of Taiwan is determined at the future Japanese peace treaty conference, the people of Taiwan, regardless of whether their ancestors were Chinese, are uniformly regarded as Japanese people. The evening newspaper hopes that the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue another denial statement. The Philippine government's suspicious attitude towards the people of Taiwan has angered overseas Chinese groups here and drawn sharp criticism from diplomatic observers. One diplomatic observer said: "If only the future Japanese peace treaty conference can determine the status of Taiwan, then the status of the Philippines also needs to be determined by the same conference, as both Taiwan and the Philippines were once under Japanese occupation."</p>
<p>[United Press, Manila, 6th] An editorial in the American-owned Manila Daily Bulletin today commented that the recent announcement by Chinese Premier Zhang Qun of his request to reclaim the Ryukyu Islands is a political test to gauge international trends. The Ryukyu Islands have no economic value to China, while the United States has sacrificed a considerable amount of money and lives. For the sake of fairness, not only should the Ryukyu Islands be administered by a United Nations agency, but so should Taiwan. (Reports from Taiwan's newspapers criticizing the absurd theories of the Manila Daily Bulletin are published in column three of page two.)</p>
<p>Government to Sell State-Owned Enterprises by Issuing Shares; Public Utilities Prices to be Adjusted According to Formulas</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The National Economic Council held its 22nd meeting at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th, chaired by Zhang Qun, and passed the following:</p>
<p>(A), Regarding the joint cotton yarn purchase plan, it was decided that the Ministry of Economic Affairs should draft trial measures and submit them for discussion at the next meeting.</p>
<p>(B), The State-Owned Enterprises Sales Supervision Committee drafted a method of selling state-owned enterprises by issuing shares, with banks organizing syndicates to raise funds. The method is as follows: The government may select several units of state-owned enterprises and designate national banks to invite banking, financial, industrial, and overseas Chinese businesses to form state-owned enterprise sale and private sector share subscription syndicates. A bank or two will be designated as the convening bank to plan new company organizations for each state-owned enterprise, handle the subscription and sales of new company shares, collect funds, and transfer them. The government should stipulate the sale price for each unit of state-owned enterprises, with the principle that each unit can independently form a new company. The syndicate should publicly raise funds to purchase the state-owned enterprises approved for sale at the price stipulated by the government, under the supervision of the State-Owned Enterprises Sales Supervision Committee. If national banks are invited to join as promoters of shares, the amount should not exceed 5% of the new company's funds. If the syndicate raises and pays the full amount of funds within the agreed time limit, it should immediately organize a new company, pay the purchase price to the government, and take over the business. If the syndicate fails to raise and pay the full amount of funds within the agreed time limit but is able to pay more than half of the purchase price, the government and the syndicate may jointly organize a new company, elect directors in accordance with the law, and transfer the business. The unpaid price will be temporarily regarded as the government's shares and will be sold continuously at market prices.</p>
<p>(C) There are eight formulas for calculating public utility prices, including formulas for electricity, tap water, gas, telephone, streetcar, small train, public bus, and ferry. In the future, public utility prices will be calculated entirely according to the formulas. If factors such as fuel, cost of living index, and foreign exchange rates change, adjustments will be made according to the formulas. Starting from January next year, each calculation formula can be used for the automatic adjustment of public utility prices. Local governments and competent authorities will also use these formulas as audit standards.</p>

In addition, the bandit troops of Hu Ming, a local communist bandit in southern Anhui, numbering about 1,000 men with guns, sneaked to a place 20 li away from Datong Town yesterday.</p>
<h3>Clear Definition of News Reporter Status by Two Departments Within the Newspaper</h3>
<p>[Report from our Nanjing Office, 6th] The News Reporter Law has not been implemented on a regular basis since the National Government ordered its postponement in June of the 34th year of the Republic. Because vocational elections are imminent, the identity of reporters must be clearly defined to meet actual needs. Therefore, the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Interior Affairs have adopted the opinions of people from all walks of life and stipulated that anyone who works as a publisher, manager, writer, editor, cartoon editor, interviewer, broadcaster, broadcast commentator, photographer, or specially contracted correspondent who specializes in news, or who is in charge of publishing advertisements in a newspaper or news agency, should be regarded as a news reporter. It is also heard that this has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for filing.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu and Others Host Reporters to Review the Work of the United Nations General Assembly; Hope for Orderly Withdrawal of Troops from Korea by the United States and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 5th] Ambassador Gu Weijun held a reception for Chinese reporters on the evening of the 5th. He said that one of the most important actions taken by the Political and Security Committee of the current United Nations General Assembly was the action on Korea. Ambassador Gu and Jiang Tingfu, Zhang Pengchun, Liu Kai, Zhu Shimin, and others who attended the reception jointly reviewed the work of the United Nations General Assembly to date and briefly described several of the more far-reaching issues that the United Nations has already addressed. Ambassador Gu discussed the resolution on the Korean issue passed by the General Assembly today and emphasized the importance of the Chinese amendment passed by the Political and Security Committee. He pointed out that the Chinese amendment would ensure that China would be consulted on the procedures for withdrawing US and Soviet troops from Korea before they are finalized. Gu stressed China's desire to achieve Korea's independence as soon as possible, and for Korea's benefit, China would also like to see the orderly withdrawal of US and Soviet troops from Korea. China attaches importance to the orderly withdrawal of US and Soviet troops because Korea borders China's northeastern provinces. (Continued on column two of page two.)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Attacking Yulin are Wavering; National Army Captures Jia County in Western Henan Province; The Battle Situation in Jilin Has Entered the Stage of Clearing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 6th] Yulin News: Morale among the troops defending Yulin is increasing due to the arrival of reinforcements. The crack troops led by General Deng Baoshan himself arrived at a certain place 20 li from the city suburbs at 8:00 AM on the 6th and will soon join forces with the defending troops inside the city. The bandit army launched a fierce attack on the city walls all day long but did not succeed and suffered heavy losses due to continuous bombing by our air force. They are now showing signs of wavering.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 6th] A certain unit of the National Army launched a fierce attack on the Communist bandits entrenched in Jia County on the morning of the 6th. After a fierce battle, the bandits were defeated and abandoned the city, fleeing south. Jia County has been recovered. (Another dispatch from Luoyang, 6th) After the Communist bandits attacking Dengfeng were defeated, they withdrew to Gaocheng (southeast of Dengfeng) on the 5th. They were intercepted by the National Army and continued to flee southeast.</p>
<p>[Report from our Xi'an Office, 6th] The war situation in western Henan has taken a sharp turn for the better, according to even the most optimistic observers. It is hoped that the eastern and western forces can join forces within ten days or even a week to open up the area along the Longhai Railway. In order to cooperate with the military progress, the Longhai Railway Bureau has stepped up efforts to restore the tracks. Director Mo Heng flew back to Xi'an from Zhengzhou this afternoon to urge the repair work from the west.</p>
<p>[Report from our Zhejiang Office, 6th] The Communist offensive in the Northeast is showing signs of moving towards southern Liaoning. According to reports from various sources, the bandits are transferring the main force of the Fourth Column to southern Liaoning, moving it from Qingyuan to Qinghe City, 50 kilometers northeast of Benxi, and Xiaoshi, 25 kilometers southeast. Another unit is also gathering, attempting to attack Benxi, an important industrial and mining city.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Another target of the bandits in southern Liaoning is Anshan, a city known for its steel smelting. More than 2,000 bandits were found in Yingtaoyuan, southeast of Wushan. The Eighth Column is approaching the outskirts of Anshan. According to the confessions of captured bandit scouts, the bandits plan to thoroughly destroy the communications between Anshan and Liaoyang to isolate and paralyze Anshan.</p>
<p>[Report from our Changchun Office, 6th] The remnants who besieged Jilin continue to reorganize in the Jilin area and may launch another fierce attack on Jilin and Xiaofengman in the short term. It is reported that Wu has transported more than 30 tanks and is gathering them five or six kilometers outside the suburbs, generally showing that Wu's ambitions have not died. Bandit troops are also gathering in Changnan, but they dare not disturb Changnan. The Second Division of Wu, which was defeated by the National Army in Fanjiatun, has now fled into Gongzhuling.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Zheng Dongguo met with the press in Changchun today and said that the bandits may launch another large-scale harassment in early December, with Jilin being particularly hard to forget. Siping and even western Liaoning are also possible targets, but the National Army is already deployed and the bandits will find it difficult to succeed. Zheng expressed extreme optimism about the future of the Northeast.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] The battle situation in Jilin has entered the stage of clearing. After defeating the attacking Wu troops, the National Army defending Jilin is now launching an attack in several directions with a part of its force to search for and capture the remnant bandits in the suburbs. One unit is advancing westward beyond Hada Bay, heading straight for Jiuzhan, while another unit is heading south, capturing Liangbanshan, Sanjiazi, and other places. In addition, scattered bandit groups around Changchun, fearing the National Army's surprise capture, began to retreat and flee on the 5th and 6th.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On the Matter of Compiling the National Budget for the Coming Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government's draft budget for the 37th year of the Republic, concerning total revenue and expenditure, has recently been largely approved by the Municipal Council and will be submitted to the Central Government for verification. This brings to mind the annual national budget for revenue and expenditure, which will soon undergo the stages of compilation, review, and approval. In today's era of rapid currency inflation and soaring prices, even a single family or business cannot accurately estimate expenses for six months or even three months. How can the nation, with its immense tasks in military affairs, politics, economics, education, construction, transportation, and other sectors, possibly plan for a year using legal tender figures? Compilers, reviewers, and approvers undoubtedly find it a headache, and even for us who want to evaluate the massive figures, it only feels troublesome and impractical!</p>
<p>A director of a tax collection agency often feels self-satisfied when this year's tax revenue exceeds the budget. A director of a business agency often uses the excuse that the budget is insufficient to complete the work and tries to evade responsibility. When we evaluate the performance of the above two agencies with the factors of currency inflation and soaring prices in mind, we feel that the excess of tax revenue over the budget is not due to the director's efforts to rectify things, but rather the result of rising prices. The failure to complete the business should not be attributed to the insufficiency of the budget, but should be blamed on the organizer's lack of foresight. In the past, there were many examples of construction projects being constrained by the budget and ultimately abandoned halfway. This is not only a huge waste of funds but, more importantly, an irreplaceable loss of time. According to the current system, for all expenditure departments, items not included in the budget, or those included but exceeding the budgeted amount, regardless of how important the business is or how urgent the work is, the auditing agency will not reimburse them. Even during the progress of the business, due to the delay of the auditing agency, the short-term estimate cannot be suitable in the face of drastic price fluctuations, let alone larger construction projects which cannot be completed in the short term.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, if we want to advance the undertakings of various departments, we must re-examine the system of compiling estimates using legal tender figures. This is not to say that we do not need a budget. On the contrary, we really need a budget, a practical and feasible budget. We want to use the budget to urge the completion of the business, not to hinder its progress. Based on this argument, we would like to offer an opinion, advocating for a budget based on work units instead of legal tender units. For example, if the Ministry of Transportation wants to build a thousand kilometers of railway in the 37th year, the budget should list the number of sleepers, the number of rails, the amount of labor required, the time required, the source of sleepers and rails, and the transportation situation. If the quantity of materials used is within the budget and the project is completed on schedule, then it can be accepted without questioning the amount of legal tender spent. If the auditing agency insists on having legal tender figures and proof that the expenditure is real, it can review the vouchers for the purchase of materials and the monthly cost of living index for workers after the fact. If the budget is made with legal tender as the unit, it will be impossible to complete it even with monthly additions. What we should pay particular attention to now is that during this period of turmoil, the military expenditure for suppressing bandits and the relief for the recovered areas will be enormous and impossible to estimate. The soldiers' provisions, the replenishment of military supplies, the relief of the old and weak, the resettlement of refugees, the reconstruction of ruins, and the management of fields cannot have accurate budgets in advance. In the process, all expenses will increase daily. Should this major event, which concerns the survival of the nation, be abandoned or be left unfinished because of budget issues? Before the bandit scourge is quelled, all construction is in vain. Why not concentrate all efforts to complete the work of quelling the turmoil first? No matter what the cost, it should be spared!</p>
<p>Should the national budget be based on income or expenditure? When a country is at war, it is certainly impossible to base it on income. It is common practice for wartime countries to balance expenditure with income. The only remedy is not to issue actual goods, but most of it is still within the scope of legal tender. Even if taxes are levied on value, the increase in tax revenue is the same due to the high prices, but it cannot be proportional to the expenditure. Therefore, it is common practice for wartime countries to have unbalanced income and expenditure. The only remedy is to issue domestic bonds or to organize foreign debts. This remedy is certainly under consideration by the government -- or perhaps it is already in progress. We hope that those in charge of financial affairs will have great courage to carry out this work, and not be deterred by the huge legal tender deficit, or even cause the businesses of various departments to stagnate.</p>

<h3>Yang Zhaolong's Report</h3>
<p>After the reports, Yang Zhaolong, Director of the Criminal Division of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, reported on his overseas judicial inspection, stating briefly: He was sent abroad last year to inspect and represent the Chinese government at the Fifth Congress of the International Association of Criminal Law, the International Conference on the Unification of Criminal Law, and the Research Committee on International Crimes, etc. He spent ten months traveling to advanced Western judicial countries such as England, the United States, and Europe, and paid attention to their judicial administrative organization and work, the changes and reforms of the legal system, the trends of legislative principles, and the conditions of prisons. Judicial administration in England and the United States is seeking to establish a systematic organization, while various European countries are striving to improve the integrity of judicial organization and work according to the development of world legal issues, such as the increasing importance of foreign-related events, juvenile crime, and rehabilitation education. In terms of the legal system, the United States has not undergone major reforms, while England and various European countries have undergone significant changes due to wartime and post-war needs. The reactionary content in the German, Italian, and French codes has been cleared. France and Belgium are revising the main codes. In addition, the powers of prosecutors have been expanded. As for the legislation of various countries in recent years, in addition to focusing on internationality, they mostly tend to reduce imprisonment and promote rehabilitation education. France's handling of juvenile offenders is the most reasonable, and its vocational schools have no prison atmosphere at all, which is very effective in improving criminals. Yang believes that after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, many new problems have arisen in China's judicial system, such as civil and criminal cases involving foreign countries and prison difficulties, etc., which all rely on colleagues to solve based on practical experience and novel theories.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu and Others Host Reporters</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) Jiang Tingfu also expressed his opinion on this point, believing that if the United Nations can handle the Korean issue in a fair manner and assist Korea in achieving true independence, then Korea will become the Scandinavian Peninsula of the Far East; otherwise, Korea will become the Balkans of the Far East. Reporters asked that if some member countries carry out threats of refusing to participate, then what will happen to the proposed committees on Greece and Korea and the proposed small General Assembly? Gu admitted that if some member countries do not participate in these mechanisms, it will hinder the work of these three bodies. However, although this kind of action is regrettable, the United Nations will implement its resolutions, and the United Nations cannot shirk its responsibility because one or two member countries refuse to participate. The Ambassador stated that the United Nations' handling of the small General Assembly, the Greek issue, and the Korean issue has strengthened the power of the General Assembly. As for Palestine, he believes that the most difficult issues are: how to implement the partition plan; and how to maintain local security after the withdrawal of British troops. Jiang Tingfu then clarified China's position on Palestine, that China does not oppose the partition of Palestine, but opposes the forced implementation of partition. Zhang Pengchun, who represents China at the Social, Charity, and Cultural Committee, said that the Economic and Social Council can prepare to deal with urgent economic and social issues starting next year. Liu Kai, who represents China at the Trusteeship Committee and the Legal Committee, said that the General Assembly exerted pressure on issues involving the welfare of people in non-self-governing territories and mandated areas during this meeting. When discussing the work of the Legal Committee, Liu mentioned China's active role in the development and compilation of international law.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yongchong, Speaker of the Jurong County Council, Assassinated in an Ambush</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Zhang Yongchong, Speaker of the Jurong County Council, was ambushed by two thugs on the morning of the 6th on his way to a friend's funeral north of the city, five miles from the city.

<h3>Taiwanese Newspapers Criticize Philippine Newspaper's Fallacies, We Must Insist on Returning Ryukyu</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 5th] Two newspapers here today published articles, both criticizing the remarks of the Manila Gazette with an intolerable attitude. The Quanmin Daily published an editorial entitled "A Serious Warning to the Philippines," stating: "The Philippines may have difficulties in opposing the return of Ryukyu to China, so it mentioned Taiwan as a bargaining chip, hoping that China would give up Ryukyu in order to maintain Taiwan. However, Taiwan is Chinese territory, which was occupied by Japan 53 years ago. Even without the decision of the Cairo Conference, China should immediately recover Taiwan after Japan's defeat two years ago, which is a matter of course." The privately-run Gonglun Daily believes that Taiwan is a part of China and should not be discussed by anyone. The newspaper said: "Regarding the proposal to determine the political status of Taiwan by means of national self-determination, what we feel is a kind of insulted anger and provocative earsplitting. Taiwan is not an adopted child, but is connected with its motherland by blood and flesh. Its position in the Chinese family is determined by nature. Now that it has fortunately returned to the embrace of the motherland, what else needs to be decided? How should it be determined?" As for the issue of returning Ryukyu to China, both of the above newspapers believe that China must insist on this claim. The Quanmin Daily also stated: "China's attitude towards the peace treaty is more lenient than that of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union advocates that it should only be discussed by the four powers, while China advocates that countries related to Japan should participate in the discussion, so that the Philippines can also participate in the conference in the future. However, the Philippines treats China without any friendship, which makes us feel infinitely indignant."</p>
<h3>Wang Maogong Points Out the Hidden Worries in Southern Jiangsu, Self-Defense Forces Should Be Strengthened</h3>
<p>[This newspaper, Zhenjiang, 6th] Chairman Wang of the Jiangsu Provincial Government reported at a press conference today that after inspecting the self-defense forces of Liyang, Yixing, and Wujin counties through Xuequanqiao to Wuxi, he directly pointed out that the shortcomings exposed by the self-defense forces in the above counties due to funding difficulties, lack of equipment and ammunition, and poor personnel management urgently need to be improved. He continued to say that there are three hidden worries in the counties of Southern Jiangsu: The people's understanding of the cruelty of the communists is still insufficient, so they fear the bandits more than they fear the law, and many communicate with the bandits and harbor them out of fear; Good people and bad people cannot be elected as village chiefs; Some local people still hold the mentality of getting by and being safe, so that in Yixing, with a population of 800,000, only one or two hundred scattered bandits are harassing it, which makes some local forces fear the bandits and not know how to resist them. In Wujin and Wuxi, with a population of more than two million, there are only a few hundred scattered bandits in the territory, but the public security problems in the rural areas of these two counties are still very serious. These are not the phenomena that should exist during the period of suppressing chaos and saving the country. It is hoped that the press will awaken the gentry and promote the officials to accelerate the strengthening of self-defense forces to ensure the public security in the north and south of the Yangtze River in the province.</p>
<h3>There Is Another Turning Point in the Export of Tung Oil to the United States, Becoming a Major Product of the Paint Industry</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 6th] According to the New York Herald Tribune, tung oil has now become the "main product" of the paint industry because its selling price is lower than that of linseed oil and castor oil, and it can be mixed with other paint raw materials. The main points of the report are as follows: Due to the continuous changes in the oils used in paint additives, the paint industry here has a trend to resume importing Chinese tung oil. Due to the invention of suitable manufacturing technology, tung oil has restored its important position in paints. The United States is now generally using petroselinic acid and tung oil to manufacture high-grade and chemically resistant paints.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Delegation's Visit to England</h3>
<p>[Our London Dispatch, October 31st Airmail] The Legislative Yuan delegation, consisting of Wu Shangying, Zhang Zhaoyuan, and Sheng Zhenwei, arrived in London on October 9th from New York. The next day was the Double Tenth Festival, and our embassy in the UK held a grand celebration with over 1,200 guests. British Prime Minister Attlee, Foreign Secretary Bevin, and ministers from various departments, as well as the speakers of both houses of Parliament, attended. The delegation met them for the first time at this event and exchanged greetings. On the afternoon of the 16th, as arranged, they accompanied Ambassador Zheng Tianxi to the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street for a 40-minute meeting with Prime Minister Attlee. On the 21st, they attended the opening ceremony of the British Parliament.

<h3>Conference of Four Foreign Ministers Begins to Discuss Treaties with Germany and Austria; Marshall to Arrive in England on the 20th of This Month</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 6th] The British Foreign Office announced that the conference of the representatives of the four major powers to discuss the German issue is scheduled to open in London at 3:40 PM standard time on the 6th. The main items on the agenda are to discuss the procedures for the peace treaty with Germany, the political institutions of Germany, and the organization to protect United Nations nationals in Germany.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 6th] Representatives of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union began their work today in a pessimistic atmosphere, seeking an agreement on the future of Germany and Austria. The opinions of the four countries differ greatly on what steps should be taken to give Germany and Austria a place in the revival of Europe. According to usually reliable sources, the United States has already drafted a plan that can be formally submitted after the Four Foreign Ministers Conference on the 26th of this month reaches a deadlock. This plan is tantamount to a separate peace treaty with the part of Germany outside the Soviet occupation zone. Although Britain is unwilling to actively support the US proposal, it seems very willing to act as a mediator between the US and the Soviet Union. France's position is still unclear. According to official spokespersons, France will oppose the establishment of a strong central government in Germany, advocating a relaxed federal system and insisting on international co-management of the Ruhr industrial area. However, the main issue hinges on the attitude of the Soviet Union. It is widely believed that in order to avoid deepening the rift with Western countries, the Soviet Union may reduce its demands for reparations from Germany's current production and suggest the complete withdrawal of all occupying forces. If this happens, the United States is reportedly planning to propose a counter-proposal, demanding the simultaneous establishment of a centralized government, granting it considerable power to avoid being controlled by an organized minority, and promoting the economic unification of Germany, so that it can have the hope of a balanced budget within a few years.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] Secretary of State Marshall revealed at a press conference that he is scheduled to fly to London on November 20 to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the peace treaties with Germany and Austria. He will go to London four days before the meeting in order to discuss with the foreign minister representatives in advance to hear the latest opinions on various issues. He also stated that he will do his best to lay a sound foundation for the solution of the German and Austrian issues. When asked by reporters whether he was optimistic or pessimistic about the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference, he replied in a military tone that he could not allow himself to be pessimistic while the battle was still in progress. When asked if Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov might not attend, Marshall replied that he had no idea how the Soviet Union would respond.</p>
<h3>Marshall Plan for European Aid to be Submitted to Congress Next Monday; Truman to Request Priority Discussion</h3>
<p>[Our Report] New York, 6th Broadcast: Washington News, President Truman told reporters today that he will ask Congress to first discuss the urgent issue of European aid and then discuss the issues of prices and inflation.

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] Secretary of State Marshall told reporters today that several key points of the European aid plan are still pending decision and are currently being studied day and night by officials in charge of the State Department.

<h3>Taber Plays a Decisive Role</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 6th] The US government is deeply concerned that the passage of the Marshall Plan will be delayed due to the activities of Taber, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and has already begun to feel uneasy. Since any program requiring appropriations must start in the House, Taber and his committee are tantamount to managing America's "purse." Although Taber will not flatly oppose the Marshall Plan, he will adopt the principle of "saving where possible" and constantly try to eliminate traces of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The House Foreign Aid Committee held two secret meetings yesterday to discuss the agenda of the special session of Congress, but no decision was made.

However, other committee members said that the committee had differing views on the following two key points: Who should be aided, and what restrictions should be placed on the aid; Who should be in charge of the aid affairs. They also said that the committee had almost abandoned the long-term aid plan and was focusing on temporary emergency relief measures, while also instructing the Department of the Army to immediately assist Germany in becoming economically and industrially self-sufficient. Some committee members advocated that temporary aid should be limited to France and Italy and may be extended to the Netherlands and Britain.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, New York, 5th] New York Governor Dewey attacked the Truman administration on the 4th, accusing it of "making economic and diplomatic mistakes" and "discriminating against our Chinese allies." He said that the US government had wasted $20 billion on foreign aid in the past two and a half years. However, he also said that the United States had no other way to go except to aid Europe, but that this aid must be based on a commercial standpoint and genuine bipartisan cooperation. He said: The sixteen countries participating in the Paris Conference should submit detailed reports, not just vague outlines; European aid is a commercial matter and a special agency should be established to supervise it, chaired by a senior businessman; Aid funds should be lent in installments, depending on whether the countries can use them well; Loans to prevent famine in Europe should not be repaid in US dollars, because "we know that Europe cannot repay us with sufficient exports"; Congress should issue a policy statement to avoid misunderstandings, so that even people in the Kremlin do not misunderstand our purpose.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Calls for Aid to China and Advocates American Tolerance of the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[US News Service, Winston-Salem, 5th] Byrnes said in a speech today that US foreign aid should not be limited to Europe, but should also include China and Korea, and should be extended with a generous spirit, but without harming the US economy itself.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Winston-Salem, 5th] Former US Secretary of State Byrnes addressed the General Convention of the Episcopal Church here on the 4th, calling for tolerance towards the Soviet Union. He said: He was extremely anxious about the morbidities and mistakes of the Soviet Union resulting from the results of the two world wars, which caused it to sometimes develop a psychological state similar to hysteria. He said; Soviet leaders are adopting aggressive policies and are hostile to world peace and the principles of the United Nations, but the United States should act as the defender of the law and should not compete with the Soviet Union for world hegemony. I wish to live in peace, I wish to treat the Soviet Union fairly, so I call for American tolerance.</p>
<h3>French Confederation of Labor Launches Offensive, Resolutely Opposing Government Economic Measures; Soviet Union Opposes Government Economic Measures</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 5th] Despite the opposition of the communist-led General Confederation of Labor, the French government resolutely implemented new economic measures today. The union quickly launched an offensive, announcing: The General Confederation of Labor is not responsible for the price increases announced by the government and will refuse to participate in the government's advisory body, the National Price Committee; The General Confederation of Labor will correspondingly raise the national minimum wage requirement.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 5th] Well-informed sources say: The Soviet Union has agreed to exchange 200,000 tons of wheat and 100,000 tons of other grains with France for manufactured goods. This proposal is being considered by France.</p>
<h3>Wave of Strikes in France and Italy</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 6th] The headquarters of the water workers' union announced that water workers are practicing "slowdown" while on the job in response to the strike by Paris sanitation workers. 300 workers at the Paris high-pressure air factory have also held a sympathy strike, demanding a wage increase of 15 to 20 percent.</p>

<h3>The UN General Assembly May End in a Month; The "Little Assembly" Proposal Will Be Submitted for a Vote; The Soviet Union Adopts a Non-Cooperative Attitude on Various Important Issues</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Lake Success, 6th] It was learned today that the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly will soon put the US-proposed "Little Assembly" to a vote. At the same time, Soviet representative Vyshinsky once again criticized the proposal as "illegal," claiming that the Soviet Union would find it difficult to participate once the "Little Assembly" was established. The Soviet Union and Poland previously refused to participate in the Balkan Border Observation Group, and Ukraine yesterday refused to participate in the Korean Committee. The Soviet Union's adoption of a non-cooperative policy to resist the various key proposals of the United States that it cannot veto, and doing this for the third time, is tantamount to using veto power in another way, and is not limited to the Security Council. What impact this will have on the future of the United Nations institutions is quite questionable. After the Political Committee concludes the debate on the Little Assembly proposal, the biggest obstacle has been overcome. The remaining cases, such as the veto power, the Franco government case, the amendment of the peace treaty with Italy, and the re-examination of Italy's application for membership, may be transferred to the future Little Assembly for discussion, or even temporarily shelved. Therefore, there is great hope that the session will be adjourned before the 27th of this month.</p>
<h3>Ahn Jae-hong of Korea Explains the Nature of Military Government Rule</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 6th] Ahn Jae-hong, the Civil Administrator of South Korea, issued a special statement yesterday (5th) stating: On the 3rd of this month, representatives of fifteen right-wing political parties, including the Korean Democratic Party, the Korean Independence Party, the Independence Promotion Association, and the Korean Democratic Party, inquired of me and questioned the "conspiracy to extend military government rebellion" as published in the left-wing newspapers. I immediately replied, "The political affairs council did indeed discuss the current situation and decided on the attitude towards international politics and South Korean politics." The handling of South Korea's economic problems, the issue of large landowners, and the nature of military government were all discussed, but there was no conspiracy to rebel or demand the extension of military government. Many people confuse "governing power" with "sovereignty." The sovereignty of Korea belongs to the Korean people, and it is only temporarily governed by the American "military government."</p>
<h3>Burmese Prime Minister Narrowly Escapes Assassination</h3>

<p>[Associated Press, London, 5th] The House of Commons overturned the Conservative Party's motion to repeal the bill allowing Burmese independence by a vote of 288 to 114 on the evening of the 5th. Opposition leader Churchill exclaimed, "We cannot accept responsibility for this bill." Mr. Churchill said that he was going to detail the history of Burma as Mr. Attlee did, but just a few strong questions would suffice. "[Burmese leaders who have met with the Prime Minister today have either been assassinated or are awaiting trial for assassination. The best among them are Aung San and U Saw. Aung San surrendered to Japan and organized an army to help Japan fight. U Saw is on trial for the murder of Aung San." However, the Conservative Party's opposition to the bill was ultimately rejected, and the Burmese Independence Bill passed its second reading.</p>

The International Mediation Committee is composed of representatives from the United States, Britain, France, and Peru. It is not clear what steps Siam will take after rejecting the committee's recommendation.</p>

<h3>Korean Independence Proposal: Full Text; Nine Nations Including China, India, and Australia to Organize Oversight Committee; to be Submitted to the General Assembly for Final Vote Next Week</h3>
<p>[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 5th] The resolution on Korean independence, amended by China, the Philippines, and India and passed by the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, may be put to a final vote by the General Assembly next week. The full text of the resolution is as follows:</p>
<p>The United Nations General Assembly recognizes the urgent and legitimate desire of the Korean people for independence, believes that the independence of the Korean nation should be restored, and that the occupying forces should withdraw as quickly as possible thereafter. The General Assembly's previous resolution stated that the freedom and independence of the Korean people cannot be justly resolved without the participation of their representatives, and decided to establish a United Nations Temporary Commission to facilitate the participation of Korean civilian representatives. Therefore, the following further decisions are made: It is decided that the representative countries shall be composed of nine countries: China, Australia, Canada, France, India, the Philippines, El Salvador, Syria, and Ukraine. The election should be held no later than the end of March 1948, based on universal adult suffrage and by secret ballot, to elect representatives. The UN delegation will consult with these representatives to expedite the freedom and independence of Korea. At the same time, these representatives will form a parliament to establish a national Korean government. The number of representatives in each electoral district should be calculated in proportion to the population, and the election should be conducted under the supervision of the UN delegation. Once the election is over, the parliament should be convened immediately to form a unified government, and the UN delegation should be notified of this matter. After the establishment of the national government, it should immediately consult with the UN delegation on the following matters: (A) Organizing domestic security forces and disbanding all military or paramilitary organizations; (B) The South Korean and North Korean military and political authorities taking over administrative power; (C) Arranging for the complete withdrawal of the occupying forces as soon as possible within the possible scope, to be implemented within ninety days. The UN delegation should facilitate and accelerate the implementation of the above plan to achieve Korean national independence and the withdrawal of the occupying forces, taking into account the results of its observations and consultations in Korea. The delegation should report the results to the General Assembly or consult with the Temporary Committee on the implementation situation (whether or not the Temporary Committee is established is undetermined). It calls upon all related countries to provide all assistance and convenience in the performance of its duties by the delegation. It calls upon all member states of the United Nations not to interfere in Korea's internal affairs during the transition period to independence, unless it is to implement the resolutions of the General Assembly, nor to take any and all actions that would undermine Korea's independence and sovereignty.</p>

<h3>Launching a Campaign to Stop Spitting: City Police Take the Lead, Committees from All Sectors Actively Promote</h3>
<p>(This newspaper report) In view of the bad habit of spitting among Chinese people, which is not only unsightly but also easily spreads tuberculosis, Lu Meiseng, president of the Public Welfare Advancement Society, yesterday at the Bankers Club, together with representatives from 12 organizations including the Municipal Government Health Bureau, Education Bureau, Police Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, Men's and Women's Youth Associations, Rotary Club, United Youth Society, Anti-Tuberculosis Joint Committee, and the United Nations World Health Organization, launched a "Campaign to Stop Spitting" and established a "Campaign to Stop Spitting Committee."</p>
<p>During the meeting, Director Zhang Wei reported that a medical research institute had collected more than 2,000 sputum samples in Shanghai several years ago and analyzed them. Among them, 16 percent contained tuberculosis bacilli. These bacilli can survive for as long as 48 days in damp places and can spread through the air. Currently, about 160,000 people die from tuberculosis in Shanghai every year. Therefore, this "Campaign to Stop Spitting" is the most important task of the anti-tuberculosis campaign. Director Yu Shuping added that the Shanghai police regulations are the same as those in New York, London, and Hong Kong. Any citizen who spits indiscriminately in public places will be fined 20 yuan or detained. The fine should be calculated at 2,000 times, and each spitting incident should be fined 40,000 yuan. In order to lead by example, the police bureau will start by banning police officers from spitting indiscriminately within a month. Director Li Ximou also promised to eliminate the bad habit of spitting in the education sector in the shortest possible time. Afterwards, the methods for preventing spitting, publicity, and fundraising were discussed. It is hoped that all organizations in the city will enthusiastically participate and support the campaign, starting with publicity and education, and then gradually enforcing it by the police bureau. Subsequently, Lu Meiseng and Xuan Ping were elected as president and vice president, respectively. The required operating expenses will be advanced by Xinhua and Jincheng, each providing 10 million yuan.</p>

While in Beiping, he heard that Gu College had a strike due to Yu Zisan's suicide, but most professors expressed their opposition, and he believed that it would be calmed down soon. The reporter then asked whether the rumor that the mayor was tired of his job was true. Mr. Wu replied with a smile: "I have resigned five times in the past, but all have been rejected. Now, unless the government dismisses me, I dare not submit my resignation again." After a brief stay at the airport, Mr. and Mrs. Wu returned to their residence to rest, and will officially resume their duties today after their vacation.</p>

<h3>Ban on Dancing to be Decided Today: First Crackdown on Tea Room Dancing, to be Banned by the End of September Next Year</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Mayor Wu returned to Shanghai from Beiping yesterday and will personally preside over the municipal meeting this morning. A decision will be made at the meeting on the implementation measures for the ban on dancing in this city. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the proposed measures are: the ban on dancing in this city is planned to be implemented in three phases. The first step is to ban tea room dancing from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. (except Sundays), and then ban tea dancing. In March next year, a lottery will be drawn to eliminate commercial dance halls, and they will be banned by the end of September. Most bars in this city have bands and bar girls to dance with customers, but their business licenses are for the wine, food, and coffee industry, not the dance hall industry. The Changju is paying attention to this and has investigated clearly, and this kind of disguised dance hall will also be banned. The implementation measures will be discussed and decided today, and the crackdown on tea room dancing will be implemented first next week.</p>
<p>Regarding the re-employment of dance hall employees and dancers, Director Wu believes that marriage is the best way out for dancers. He also believes that the banned dance halls should plan to convert to economic cafeterias to maintain the livelihood of the employees. However, this cannot be done without sufficient preparation, and the existing equipment needs to be modified. The authorities are not ordering all dance halls to be converted into economic cafeterias. If the boss has a way to maintain the livelihood of the employees, they can be converted into shopping malls, etc.</p>

<h3>Failure to Prevent Known Dangers: District Prosecutor's Office Files Public Prosecution Against Zhang Chunfan for Instigating Suicide</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] After Yue opera star Xiao Danggui committed suicide by taking poison, Zhang Chunfan, manager of the Guotai Yue Opera Theater, was accused of instigating suicide. Yesterday morning, the District Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution. The original text of the indictment stated: "Defendant Zhang Chunfan, 41 years old, from Sheng County, residing at No. 11 Songjia Lane, Beijing Road, in custody. The victim, Qian Chunyun, known as Xiao Danggui, had been living with the defendant Zhang Chunfan for many years. At 11 p.m. on October 7 of this year, Qian Chunyun and Jin Zhaoyuan (i.e., Lengshan) returned from a night out, and were discovered by the defendant, who suspected them of having an affair. He questioned her day and night, and Qian had no way to defend herself, so she indicated her intention to commit suicide. The defendant knew her feelings, and not only did he not take precautions, but he also kept nagging and did not give in, causing Qian Chunyun to take Lysol and commit suicide at about 4 p.m. on the 13th of the same month. After the incident, various newspapers competed to publish the news, and rumors arose. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau arrested the defendant for interrogation and sent him to the prosecutor's office. During the interrogation, the defendant firmly denied instigating Qian Chunyun's suicide. However, Qian had stated before her death that if her body was unclean, she could commit suicide. When the defendant summoned Jin Zhaoyuan for questioning, he also said to Jin, 'If Xiao Danggui commits suicide, it is because of you,' etc. Jin Zhaoyuan and Wu Chen, who were present at the scene, unanimously confirmed that this was true, as evidenced by the interrogation records of the police bureau and this office. It is undoubtedly true that Qian Chunyun's suicide was foreseen by the defendant, since she had indicated her intention to commit suicide and the defendant had relayed it to Jin Zhaoyuan. Anyone who causes the danger of a certain result occurring due to his own actions has the obligation to prevent its occurrence, as stipulated in Article 15, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Since the defendant knew that Qian Chunyun was in danger of committing suicide and did not take precautions, his passive inaction was no different from actively instigating others to commit suicide. Moreover, after reading the original police bureau files in detail, the defendant's anger had not subsided until Qian Chunyun committed suicide, and his nagging was not without suspicion of instigating Qian Chunyun's suicide. His actions constitute a crime under Article 275, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and a public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law."</p>
<h3>Resolution of Caobao Road Right of Way: Each Allocated Two Vehicles to Operate</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] Caobao Road in West Shanghai was applied for opening by the Shanghai-Minhang Transportation Automobile Company before the war and approved by the Municipal Government. After the victory, local people organized the Caobao Road Transportation Committee and leased four group buses from the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company to operate back and forth to maintain traffic. The Shanghai-Minhang Company repeatedly applied to the Municipal Government for negotiations due to the right of way, but it was not resolved. Later, Yang Hu, Wu Kaixian, and others convened the responsible persons from both sides to mediate, cooperate with each other, and each allocated two vehicles to form the Jibao Road Transportation Management Committee. The route starts from Laoximen, passes Xiangyang South Road to Xujiahui, enters Caobao Road, and goes directly to Qibao Town, with a total length of more than 30 Chinese miles. The fares are divided into 4,000, 6,000, 8,000, and 10,000. The departures are from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., every 40 minutes. A contract has now been signed, and the traffic has been open since the previous day.</p>
<h3>Yu Shengxiao Murder Case: Retrial on the 13th, but Lee</h3>
<p>The US Military Court Judgment Not Borrowed</p>
<p>[This newspaper report] British suspect Lee in the murder of black market gold broker Yu Shengxiao. After several trials by Judge Zhu Yuhuang of the District Court, the facts of the case have become clear. It is learned that the case will be retried in Criminal Court 1 at 2 p.m. on the 13th of this month. If no other new clues or evidence are discovered at that time, the trial can be concluded and a sentence can be scheduled. As for the District Court's previous letter to the US Military Court to borrow the Mallory judgment, the US Military Court replied that the full text of the judgment had been sent to the US Military Advisory Group in Nanjing for review and could not be borrowed. The District Court believes that the evidence is already sufficient, and the judgment seems to be of little importance, so it has given up on borrowing it.</p>
<h3>Qiu Lianhuan Assassination Case Continues: Five Defendants, "Hercules," Get Anxious and Call the Judge "Brother," Saying He is Restless in Prison and Wants to be Transferred to the Detention Center</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] The Qiu Lianhuan assassination case continued in the Criminal Court 9 of the District Court yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Cao Zuwei. The defendants Wei Xiaoyang, Li Desheng, Ma Caide, Ye Dongying, and Chai Liangjiang were escorted to the court by bailiffs. Qiu's wife also sat in the audience to listen to the confessions of the defendants. The first to testify was Zhou Bingquan, the accountant of the Zhijiang Bathhouse, followed by Wang Abao, the tea servant of the Zhijiang Tea House, and Wu Zhishun, the tea servant of the Paradise Theater. Then, the separate interrogation of the defendants began. Wei Xiaoyang, known as "Oriental Hercules," wearing a dark blue gown, stated in the defendant's stand: He does not have the nickname "Oriental Hercules" and did not participate in the murder. This matter was framed by Li Zhenyu, an inspector of the 6th Inspection Brigade of the Police Department, because he wanted to see a white show and was refused by me. Please investigate this. Judge Cao questioned him, saying that the evidence of your plan to kill Qiu is conclusive. Why don't you confess truthfully? "Hercules" became so anxious that he blurted out to the court: "Brother, I am really wronged. If you don't believe me, just investigate." The audience was in an uproar when they heard Wei call the judge "Brother." Wei's defender stood up and requested that Li Zhenjin, who is currently in custody for another case, be subpoenaed to the court for cross-examination at the next hearing. The court ordered that a decision be made after verification. Next, Li Desheng was summoned. He testified that he only knew Wei Xiaoyang and did not know the other defendants. He did not participate in the murder. "I am really wronged." In prison, I only talked with Sheng Shugen, nicknamed, and did not quarrel with him. "On the evening of June 5, I took a bath in the bathhouse and then talked in the South." Someone at the Fang Theater told me that Wei Xing and my wife had been arrested by the police. I went to the branch office to inquire, but they replied that they did not know. I went back to the theater to work. At about 12 o'clock, the theater closed, and people in the theater said that Wei was related to the Qiu Shuhuan murder case and advised me to hide. Since I didn't know about this, why should I hide? So I went to the General Bureau on Fourth Road to inquire about the whereabouts of my wife, but I was also detained. Li Caide also denied participating in the murder. He did not quarrel in prison. He only knew that Mao Qingyun often caused trouble inside. Chai Liangjiang testified: He is 25 years old this year. He was listening to the theater in the Paradise Theater that day and did not return home until 12 o'clock. How could he know about the Qiu case? At this point, the court ordered that the defendants in this case did not follow the rules in prison. In addition to transferring them to the Masnan Road Detention Center for separate detention, each of their detention periods was extended by three months. The case was rescheduled for retrial. After the court adjourned, reporters asked Qiu's wife, Chen Aizhu, about her thoughts. Chen, wearing a gray woolen coat, with permed hair and powder, looked quite modern, and said that Qiu and Zhang Xingbao had a feud. Once, Qiu, Zhang, and Sheng Shugen were having a tea talk at Chen's home. Because Sheng Shugen sided with Zhang Xingbao, Qiu intended to use force, and Zhang knelt down to beg for peace before the matter was resolved. At this point, Chen said in a rather sad and indignant tone: "If I had known this would happen, I would rather have let Qiu injure Sheng and the others and face a lawsuit. Now, sitting in jail, he wouldn't have been hacked to death."</p>

<h3>Investigation Completed on the Case of Former Judge Yu Hua of the Second Branch of the High Court Being Shot; Xia Chao and Two Others Indicted Under the Anti-Traitor Ordinance</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] During the War of Resistance, Yu Hua, the judge of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, was fatally shot by the puppet agent Xia Chao. After investigation by the High Procuratorate, Xia Chao, Xia Zhang, and Zhang Chuntang have been publicly prosecuted under the Ordinance for Punishing Traitors. It is reported that Judge Yu was upright and impartial during his tenure, and he dealt severely with the crimes committed by members of the puppet organization in the former concessions. As a result, the puppet organization hated him intensely and wanted to eliminate him at all costs.</p>
<p>At the time, Xia Chao served as the captain of the First Brigade of the Puppet Agent Headquarters' Task Force, and his wife, Xia Zhang, also worked in the same puppet agency, drafting reports and documents for her husband. The Puppet Agent Headquarters dispatched Xia to assassinate Yu Hua. Xia, together with Zhang Chuntang, a shareholder in a gambling establishment in Shanghai's West, gathered seven or eight people and waited outside Yu Hua's residence at 202 Shanzhong Road for three days. On the morning of November 23rd of the 28th year (1939), at around 9:00 AM, as Yu Hua was heading out in his own rickshaw, Xia suddenly fired three shots with a pistol. Yu collapsed in a pool of blood and died instantly. Xia turned and fled. The hired rickshaw puller, Zhou Yejin, shouted after him, and Xia turned back and fired another shot before getting into a car numbered 8771 at the intersection of Pushi Road and Yuting, escaping. Subsequently, the French police investigated and found that the car belonged to the Staff Department of the Puppet Agent Headquarters at No. 76, and it was confirmed that the pistol used in the attack had been sent for use in assassinations. Xia had previously served as the chief of the Zhoujiaqiao Investigation Squad of the New Han Branch of the Puppet Shanghai Special City Police Bureau, and the leader of the Detective Squad of the Puppet Qingpu County Police Bureau.

Subsequently, Wang accused Jin Wensheng, the owner of the Jinshunxing Shop, and Zhang Baoxing, the owner of the Zhangshunxing Shop, of destroying the union office. After separate investigations by the General Labor Union and the police, it was determined that Jin and Zhang were legitimate businessmen and had not engaged in the destruction of the union office. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also sent a telegram to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, proving that the facts are indeed unrelated to Jin Wensheng and Zhang Baoxing.</p>

<h3>Sun Qinchi and Others Undergo Seventh Trial in the Case of Alleged Embezzlement of Received Oil Supplies</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] Sun Qinchi, the former director of the Municipal Government's General Affairs Department, Shen Zhenjia, the director of the Motor Vehicle Section, and Shen Wenyuan, a clerk in the section, were accused of embezzlement for receiving large quantities of materials such as kerosene, engine oil, and iron bars from the enemy Japanese-operated Izumitsu Company (short for China Izumitsu Industries Co., Ltd.). After six trials, the seventh trial was held again in the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court at 10 AM yesterday, presided over by Judge Wu Shaochang. Sun Qinchi and Shen Zhenjia both denied concealing materials and failing to report them.</p>
<p>Shen Wenyuan testified that in September of the 34th year (1945), when he was ordered to go to the Izumitsu Company's warehouse to transport two cars, he discovered oil and immediately reported it to his supervisor for handling. He was instructed to have Izumitsu Company prepare a detailed inventory of the oil for verification. The Japanese in the company said that the accountant was not present, so they hastily filled it out in pencil. It was handed over to Shen Zhenjia, the director of the Motor Vehicle Section, who submitted it to Sun Qinchi, the director of the General Affairs Department. He was instructed that the detailed list was not in the correct format, lacked the signature and seal of a responsible person, and was written in pencil, so it could not be used as a basis for verification in the future. He was ordered to prepare a formal list for verification. The original list was already waste paper and there was no need to keep it, so it was casually discarded. The indictment's claim that it was intentionally concealed has no basis in law. Subsequently, the witness Zhou Yunshan testified that he was in charge of the warehouse at 360 Yanping Road of the Izumitsu Company, and there were a total of 624 barrels of kerosene and diesel oil. On October 30th of the 34th year, the Third Army sent people to seal up the batch of materials. The next day, 120 barrels were taken away by truck, and the remaining items were sold by the customs. When Shen Wenyuan came to the warehouse to seal it, he did not see him take any oil. Finally, after the defendants' lawyers explained the capacity of the oil drums and the weight of each drum, the court ordered another hearing at a later date.</p>

<h3>An Enigmatic Scene: Major Conflicts in Jinan's Renfeng Cotton Mill</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Jinan Correspondent, July 3rd] A major event has occurred in Jinan in recent weeks. This event involves Ma Bosheng, the current chairman of the Jinan Chamber of Commerce, as the "protagonist." The incident has further implicated the "enemy and puppet equity handling" and "takeover issues" of Jinan's largest cotton mill, "Renfeng Cotton Mill," which is chaired by Ma Bosheng. As a result, the content has become increasingly complex and delicate, becoming not only the top headline or sidebar news on the local editions of Jinan's newspapers but also the most important topic of conversation for all "locals" during their leisure time. The incident began with a notice posted by Jiang Ziyuan, the former deputy manager of Renfeng Cotton Mill, in Jinan's Cheng Bao:</p>
<p>A Notice</p>
<p>The main idea was that he wanted the executive of Renfeng Cotton Mill (referring to Ma Bosheng) to answer him clearly: "The factory was given a check for 25 million yuan on October 10 by Ms. Cui Yonghe from Changsheng Gong Silver Shop, issued on October 7th, numbered 001524. Because he did not know what the check was for, he did not dare to accept it. In addition to properly saving the check, he hereby exposed it in newspapers and humbly requested a reply in five days, in order to alleviate his anxiety." (Excerpt from the original text) As the Guomin Evening News said: "In today's society, countless people want to make a fortune, even attempting to hoard huge profits by getting rich by being sullied. This Mr. Jiang is willing to not accept money, and can be considered a news in the year of people getting rich." What is equally intriguing is that the check was handled by Ms. Cui Yonghe, Jinan's most famous "socialite celebrity," who is currently the female secretary of the Pacification Zone and a female senator of the Shandong Provincial Government. Therefore, the news spread quickly, arousing widespread public attention to the issue. Then, on October 26, the Jinan Zhong Bao first published an interview with Ms. Cui. According to her, "After the July 7th Incident, when the enemy invaded the north bank of Luokou and bombarded Jinan, Renfeng Cotton Mill gathered all employees and announced that the situation was critical. Those who wished to return home would have their salaries suspended, while those who remained at the factory to defend the business would receive double pay. Jiang Ziyuan was the deputy manager at the time and was willing to stay." "The check for 25 million yuan was the factory's reward to Mr. Jiang for defending the factory." (Excerpt from the original text)</p>
<p>Five days quickly passed. Ma Bosheng did not formally reply to Jiang Ziyuan. All that everyone saw was a</p>
<p>Letter in Reply</p>
<p>from Mr. Ma to Mr. Jiang, which was disclosed in the Guomin Evening News on October 29th, written on the 6th of the same month but "never sent." The letter listed, "…when the Japanese enemy occupied the cotton mill, all colleagues were expelled, but you alone remained in the factory. Therefore, colleagues suspected that you were playing tricks in front of the enemy. This led to the digging up of old accounts, accusing you of embezzling the Zhangqiu cotton money and Weixian cloth money from the factory, and reporting you with evidence. You were then forced to leave the factory. I have always felt that the former colleagues were too intolerant, … therefore, I gave you 5 million yuan during the Mid-Autumn Festival last year and 3 million yuan during the New Year, and I believe I have not dishonored my friendship. Unexpectedly, you are not afraid of hard work and are insatiable. This spring, you again asked Mr. Miao Hainan to borrow another 1.8 million yuan. I am unable to provide this assistance…" In addition, the letter mentioned Jiang's request to Mr. Ma to be reinstated and the approval process, as well as…"Unexpectedly, in early July, leaflets were found all over the city with the title "See Ma Bosheng's Top Ten Sins," and some specifically stated that questions could be asked to Jiang Ziyuan, etc…" (All bracketed information is excerpted from the original text.)</p>
<p>What kind of conflict is going on between Jiang Ziyuan and Ma Bosheng? What is the inside story? This is only their private matter, at most a conflict within Renfeng, and does not deserve the widespread attention of the public. However, it is because of the</p>
<p>Jiang-Ma Conflict</p>
<p>that the "enemy and puppet equity handling" and "takeover issues" of Renfeng Cotton Mill, which are related to national interests, have been raised. According to the Jinan newspapers from October 25th until the time the reporter wrote this article: "The issue of the takeover, which has caused nationwide heartache after the victory, is about to face a major test here, namely, the handling of the equity of the traitor Yin Tong in Renfeng Cotton Mill. Considering that Yin served as the general manager of the factory both before the war and during the occupation, and held a large number of shares, the factory does not seem to be able to be returned immediately. Even after the return, the process of handling the equity of the traitor should be publicly announced by the relevant authorities and the factory to the public in order to clear doubts. The internal conflicts of the factory have been partially revealed due to Mr. Jiang Ziyuan's refusal to accept the 25 million yuan paid by Ma Bosheng…" "It was recently learned that in 1938 (the 27th year of the Republic of China), Manager Ma Bosheng, on the order of Yin Tong, the puppet general manager of the North China Construction Directorate, sent a letter to the staff of Jinan factory, instructing them to sell some small shares, totaling 175,000 yuan, to the puppet China Preparatory Bank at a price that was 10% higher than the face value. After the victory, it was heard that this equity, which had been sold to the puppet side, was purchased by Ma Yiqing (Ma Bosheng's brother). What kind of method did Ma use to obtain this equity is also intriguing…" "On March 20th, 1942, at a time when our sacred war of resistance was entering a difficult stage, Yin Tong, the General Manager of Renfeng Cotton Mill and the puppet Director of the Construction Directorate, convened a shareholders' meeting at the Provincial Library in Daming Lake, with Ma as the chairman. The list of all directors was posted, claiming that this was decided by the Director Yin in Beijing and could not be changed. After a formal election procedure with red and green ballots, Ma led the group to Lixia Pavilion, where he and the representative sent by the Japanese signed the contract for the joint operation of the Jinan Renfeng Cotton Mill between China and Japan. Then, they took photos and raised glasses to celebrate the success of Sino-Japanese cooperation…" "…A shareholder of Renfeng expressed dissatisfaction that Manager Ma Bosheng did not present the original inventory list to the shareholders' meeting, and that during the acceptance period, it was rumored that a large number of cloths were covered with coal ash, transported out and sold illicitly, and the true facts of the matter were not explained…" "…Since Yin Tong was an enemy-flattering traitor, after he automatically agreed to jointly operate Renfeng Cotton Mill with the Japanese, the Japanese gave 1.8 million yuan in puppet currency to Manager Ma Bosheng for distribution. Ma handled it as follows: 400,000 yuan to the shareholders, 17,000 yuan to all employees, and the remaining 1,383,000 yuan is still a mystery as to whether it was kept by Ma…" "…Ma Bosheng had already fled to Beiping before the Japanese invaders captured Jinan. He would not have been threatened by the Japanese at that time. His return to Jinan to preside over the signing of the contract with the Japanese constitutes the crime of colluding with the enemy and being a traitor. The court prosecutor should prosecute him according to the law. Why is he still allowed to roam free?…" "…After Jinan fell in 1937, the factory was occupied by the enemy. In 1938, Ma Yiqing (Ma Bosheng's brother) suddenly returned to Jinan and contacted the shareholders, claiming that his brother (Ma Bosheng) said that since the cotton mill was occupied by the enemy, all the assets would be lost. In order to protect their rights, he had discussed with Yin Tong (the general manager of the factory) to sell each share at a price that was 10% higher than the face value, which would be collected by the puppet Preparatory Bank. A total of 175,000 yuan was received at that time, but it was not stated who the buyer was. According to the situation at the time, it may have been purchased by Yin Tong. After the victory, Ma Bosheng used the fact that Yin Tong was a traitor and that his property had become traitor property to intimidate Yin's family to take the stock back for himself. He gave part of it to powerful people, and another part was given to two or three powerful shareholders because their sale was unclear at the time. They threatened to sue in court, and Ma gave them a portion in order to appease the situation. The relevant authorities can investigate the archives of the puppet Preparatory Bank to see who the buyer was. The mystery should not be difficult to solve…" "…The board of directors of the factory was originally scheduled to meet on October 29. Due to the small number of attendees, only Cui Shijie (the current chairman of the factory) convened Ma Bosheng, Zhang Weiwei, Chen Lunsheng, and Xin Zhujiu, who seemed to be discussing privately. Cui brought up the issue of Jiang's reinstatement, which Ma Bosheng flatly rejected, saying "There will be Ma but no Jiang." Later, he mentioned that Yin Tong's 300,000 shares during the enemy puppet period had been transferred to Ma Yiqing's name with my notarization,… At this point, the meeting ended without any results." (The above is excerpted from the Spring and Autumn Agency's manuscript and Cheng Bao's report.)</p>
<p>After the newspapers in Jinan published the above news, all newspapers received a threatening letter on October 31, signed by the department heads of Renfeng Cotton Mill, representing 2,500 employees, and bearing the names and seals of 37 employee representatives, including Ma Xude. For the sake of their own safety, the news media held an emergency meeting and decided to forward the original letter to the Defense Command for legal protection. Then, on the 1st of this month, Zhao Mingyuan and others, the people in charge of the Shandong Branch of the Chinese Islamic Association, hosted the Jinan news media. Ma Bosheng tried to</p>
<p>avoid the main points</p>
<p>Aside from briefly explaining that under his leadership, Renfeng Cotton Mill, which has 18,000 spindles, has increased its daily output from 1 piece of yarn and 7 bolts of cloth at the time of the victory's takeover to the current 41 pieces of yarn and 460 bolts of cloth, and the reasons why he "ran to Beiping, occupied by the enemy, while other people ran to the motherland" during the War of Resistance (see the Guomin Evening News, October 25), Ma Bosheng has not sent letters to the newspapers to request corrections, nor has Ma published notices to deny the allegations. As a result, the situation has become increasingly confusing and unfathomable to outsiders. Aside from "knowing that the scope of this issue is very large, involving the public cover-up of the property of a major traitor and the 'merger' of small shareholders by large shareholders, as well as the heavy involvement of wealthy merchants," the details are, as the Spring and Autumn Agency said, only waiting for the "thorough investigation" by Inspector Guo Zhonghuai of the Yulu Supervisory Office and relevant parties, who have already begun to pay attention to this matter in Luoyang, and have also cracked down on several "tigers" in Shandong.

<h3>Fujian Province Universally Builds Bunkers and Implements Joint Border Area Defense</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch from Fuzhou, 3rd day] The boundary hills and ridges are Chongqing, the forests are dense and the valleys are secluded, the inland roads are either hastily opened and simple, or dilapidated and waiting for repair, resulting in difficult transportation in the border counties, like the Shu Road, bandits gather, and the country has difficulties moving forward. Especially in the dense mountains of northern Fujian, Gutian, Zhenghe, Songxi, and other counties, the suffering is constant. This suppression and that escape are difficult to achieve effective results. The northern Fujian bandits can be divided into three parts: Zuo Feng-mei, Chen Gu-lao, and Wang Wen-bo. Occasionally, they collude with the communists. After the security police force pursued them in separate ways, their strength was scattered, and they returned to being fragmented and fled everywhere.

<h3>Li Zongren Suggests Granting One Million to Each Faculty Member in Beijing and Tianjin to Cover Individual Coal Expenses; Ministry of Education Plans to Request Separate Appropriation from the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>[This newspaper dispatch from Nanjing, 6th day] Hu Shih and others from the education sector in Peiping, when Chairman Chiang arrived in Peiping, said that the northern climate was extremely cold, most professors were poor scholars, and at a time of high prices and meager treatment for professors, they were really unable to buy coal themselves to keep warm and cold. Upon direct request, the Chairman expressed sympathy and suggested that the head of the Peiping Executive Headquarters, Li Zongren, request the Ministry of Education to guarantee and issue 1 million yuan to each faculty member of colleges and universities in Peiping and Tianjin to purchase inexpensive coal for the needs of keeping warm and cold. It is reported that the Ministry of Education believes that there are more than 3,000 faculty members in colleges and universities in Peiping and Tianjin, costing about 3 billion yuan. The Ministry of Education will guarantee the expenditure, which will be impossible to compensate in the future. The cold in the north is not limited to Peiping and Tianjin. If the northeast and northwest are also taken into account, the funds required are even greater. Therefore, after careful consideration, it is planned to request a separate appropriation from the Executive Yuan to meet the needs.</p>
<p>[Hualian News Agency, Peiping, 6th day] For the winter coal issue, faculty members of colleges and universities in Peiping and Tianjin were specially allowed to send representatives, including Zheng Tian-ting, Secretary-General of Peking University, Shen Lu, Secretary-General of Tsinghua University, and Yang Guang-bi of the Peiping Research Institute, to visit Director Li yesterday.

<p>[Another dispatch] After the Executive Headquarters approved two tons of winter coal per person for colleges and universities, each school went to the Coal Supply Committee to negotiate and pay the fees. It is reported that the price of two tons is within one million yuan, and it can be received within three days.</p>

<h3>United Nations Educational Conference Opens in Mexico Yesterday; Mexican President Aleman Delivers Welcome Address</h3>

The Soviet Union's non-participation in the Education and Science Conference is clear to the wise. The Soviet Union believes that this meeting believes that the cause of war is due to the spirit of mankind, which is an ideological error. The Soviet Union believes that economic problems are the only cause of war. People see different things in different ways and cannot agree with each other, so it is difficult to hope for their participation.</p>

However, two new ward buildings and the necessary equipment need to be built, costing a total of 62 billion yuan, which is being negotiated with the Joint Relief Administration for a loan.

<h3>Export Promotion Office Actively Prepares Export Goods Visa Measures Aims to Fully Understand the Actual Situation of Export Industry, Which is Completely Different from the Nature of Import Goods Control</h3>
<p>Regarding the visa matter of export materials, the Export Promotion Office of the Import and Export Control Commission is actively preparing. Its visa measures have been approved. Cities with branches of the Import and Export Control Commission will handle this visa measure simultaneously to ensure national consistency and facilitate exporters. Therefore, its preparation requires quite some time. It can be announced and implemented in the middle of this month. After this news spread, exporters believed that it would increase the difficulty of exporting and held opposing opinions. Recently, according to a person in charge of the Export Promotion Office of the Import and Export Control Commission, it is solemnly stated: this measure is handled in accordance with the responsibilities stipulated after the reorganization. There are two purposes: to know the real situation of the export industry; to obtain accurate export statistics. My export industry is still in a difficult stage, and its shortage and increase in exports should be fully understood. If there is a shortage, the reason for the shortage should be studied, whether it is insufficient funds, problems with transportation, or low international market prices, or repeated increases in costs, it should be further clarified to help solve its difficulties so that it can be smoothly withdrawn. The bear market is normal, and quantity increase should also be sought. This is all well-intentioned assistance, not malicious control. The procedure is extremely simple. After the exporter obtains the application form and fills it out, it will be sent to the designated bank for transfer to the office. After reviewing the price, it will be transferred to the customs for approval to export, and the merchants will be provided with convenience in terms of technology and time as much as possible, which is completely different from import control.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Import and Export Control Commission yesterday announced the issuance of import licenses for October as follows: There are 388 copies of goods belonging to the attached table, 1009 copies of goods belonging to the attached table, and 872 copies of Class A goods belonging to the attached table.</p>
<h3>Silk Association's 17th Regular Meeting Resolves that the Principle of Substituting Cotton Yarn for Woven Cloth will be Allocated to the Northeast, and the Yarn and Cloth will be Delivered in Installments</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Silk Adjustment Committee held its 17th regular meeting yesterday and resolved that more than 20 spinning mills in the first quarter still have not paid in full for the spinning of foreign cotton. The Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District will be responsible for urging them to pay. As for the standard of spinning labor, the labor and materials have also increased due to the rising cost of living index last month. The calculation is complicated and will be discussed together today. There have been several principled decisions on the method of substituting cotton yarn for woven cloth: The woven cloth is specified to be 40 yards long, 36 inches wide, and 12 pounds of fine cloth. The substitution method is divided into two types: yarn-for-cloth and payment of labor. The detailed rules will be discussed separately. The substitution period is three months, and both parties can agree to renew the contract. Before the substitution is completed, the substituting factory will pay a certain percentage of the cloth first. The substitution area is not limited to Shanghai, and the selection of substitution factories is also very strict. The quality of its products, the equipment in the factory, its reputation, and it must be a member of the association.</p>
<p>Yang Chuoan, Chairman of the Materials Adjustment Committee of the Northeast Headquarters, also attended the meeting yesterday and stated that there are more than 400 cloth factories in the Northeast, all of which will be forced to stop production due to the lack of raw materials, and cotton cloth is also extremely scarce. He requested the Silk Adjustment Committee to allocate 3,000 pieces of cotton yarn and tens of thousands of pieces of cloth to meet the urgent needs. As a result, 1,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 50,000 pieces of cotton cloth were approved, and the goods will be delivered in installments, and the payment will be calculated according to the negotiated price on the delivery date.</p>

Exports from Hong Kong amounted to 400 tons in September and may increase to 1,000 tons in October, most of which are exported to the United Kingdom, because the price of tung oil in the British market is currently slightly higher than that in the United States. However, due to the recent strict investigation of export smuggling in Hong Kong and Guangdong, and because tung oil is currently in a transitional period in various places, the smuggling of tung oil in Hong Kong is no longer as rampant as in the past.</p>

<p>New Medicine and New Drugs</p>
<h3>The Acute Hearing of the Blind</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>Blind people, having lost their sight, have other unusually keen senses to compensate. This is a gift from the Creator, just as deaf-mutes have particularly acute vision. Among the keen senses possessed by blind people, hearing is the most important. The fingers of both hands are next, and the sense of touch is also particularly keen. For example, by pressing the fingers on various substances to feel their thickness, even the thickness of fabric weaves, the thickness of paper, it is even possible to know the beauty or ugliness of a woman's face by touching it with your hand. Is that not strange?</p>
<p>Mechnikov (1908) recorded that blind people, when walking on the ground, are able to know the existence of obstacles a considerable distance ahead, and therefore can cleverly avoid collisions. He called it the sixth sense. It is said, "There was an old professor who had been blind for forty years, walking alone in the park, never colliding with a tree or tripping over a stone. He knew and was prepared to avoid it from a distance of two meters. One day, he walked into a building he had never been in before. In the center of the room, there was a large instrument stored, and he was able to know it early on. Another blind person, when walking in the city streets, was able to distinguish shops or residences. He could even count the number of windows." According to Mechnikov's theory, these special senses are due to the function of the blind person's eardrum (or rely on his keen hearing). Because of his keen hearing, he is able to hear subtle sounds; when he walks, the air vibrations reflected from the surface of the surrounding objects can be used to infer the existence of the object. We now know even more that bats do not accidentally touch other objects when flying at night, also for this reason. In this Great War, Britain and the United States used this principle to invent radar, which helped the victory of the war a lot. Is it not more strange and wonderful than the particularly keen senses of blind people?</p>
<h3>Black Fever</h3>
<p>— Chu Lin-sun</p>
<p>Black fever is a chronic infectious disease, with main symptoms including long-term irregular fever, enlarged liver and spleen, decreased white blood cells, and anemia. Many people commonly call black fever "lumps disease," but lumps disease is not necessarily black fever; because lumps are a symptom, not unique to black fever! Many people treat black fever as typhoid, malaria, tuberculosis, etc., which of course will not have good results, missing the time when modern medicine can help, and slowly dragging the patient to death! What is the reason for this? Is this disease rare in China? Is it difficult to diagnose? No! No! It is one of the major epidemics in China, taking away many lives of compatriots every year! It loses an immeasurable amount of national productivity!</p>
<p>In 1903, Laveran and Mesnil, in memory of Leishmanng and Donovan's contributions to the pathogen of this disease, named the parasite Leishmania donovanl. It lives in the endothelial cells of the patient's blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, and is most abundant in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. The pathogen can also be found in the large mononuclear white blood cells, large phagocytes, or urine, stool, nasal mucosa, tonsils, and saliva of patients. The most likely vector for transmission is the sandfly Phlebotomus.</p>
<p>In 1875, black fever was prevalent in Assam, India, causing many deaths. The disease is found in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Western Hemisphere, especially in countries along the Mediterranean coast. The history of black fever's prevalence in China must be very early. Due to the lack of detailed clinical signs and the lack of equipment for microscopic examination, it was not noticed by everyone until 1910, when Aspland made the first confirmed diagnosis in China. In the recent thirty years or so, due to the expansion of disease areas, the increase in patients, the discovery of the sandfly which is the transmission vector, and the proof of natural and experimental flagellated protozoa, China has been recognized as one of the major epidemic areas of black fever in the world. In Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Anhui, in addition to many cases, the discovery of the transmitting insect, sandfly, and the animal (six) protective host, confirms that it is the most severely prevalent area. After the Anti-Japanese War, scattered cases have spread across the country. Reports have been made in various provinces in Northeast China, Gansu, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Shaanxi, Lanzhou, and other places. If there are only human cases without transmission vectors and protective hosts, it cannot be considered an epidemic area. However, Hou Baozhang inspected cases and the sandfly which is a transmission vector in Guanxian and Lifan in Sichuan, so Sichuan has the potential to become an epidemic area. Last year, a large number of refugees from northern Jiangsu crossed the river to the south. I don't know how many of them have black fever. If sandflies also breed and spread in the Shanghai area, then, in a few years, the Jiangnan area will definitely become an uncollectible black fever epidemic area.</p>
<p>Why is this disease overlooked by people? Because the symptoms are not particularly obvious, it is not possible to determine what the disease is simply by looking with the eyes, listening with the ears, and examining the patient's pulse and tongue coating. The incubation period from infection to onset is about ten days to three or four months. There are no external symptoms. After that, there will be hectic or intermittent fever, with subjective symptoms such as headache and vomiting. The body temperature can have two or three high points within 24 hours. The entire fever process is irregular. During this period, white blood cells decrease, anemia, and heart weakness occur. Sometimes there are also rheumatic joints with mild persistent fever. After five months, the spleen and liver gradually enlarge, and the abdomen is distended. The spleen is often very large. When touched, there is a large one. At this time, the patient's appearance is haggard and skin and bones are like firewood; the skin color gradually becomes darker, as if black, because the skin color is dark, there is fever and chills, so it is called black fever. There is swelling of the back of the foot, dropsy, and the skin and mucous membranes are prone to bleeding. The stool is like dysentery. After half a year or a year or two, the patient dies due to excessive weakness! Or dies due to tuberculosis, sepsis, pneumonia, etc.!</p>
<p>Its course takes such a long time, without a special, reliable symptom that can determine that the patient definitely has black fever. If you don't go through a proper diagnostic procedure, how can you not make a mistake? At first, it is just fever, and there are many diseases that cause fever! Enlarged spleen and liver, decreased white blood cells, are not unique to this disease. Therefore, we must distinguish it from other diseases that can cause fever and can enlarge the liver and spleen, such as: typhoid fever, malaria, relapsing fever, amoebic liver abscess, intestinal tuberculosis, Hodgkin's disease, Banti's disease, leukemia, infantile biliary cirrhosis, Japanese schistosomiasis, etc., before we can prescribe the right medicine and save the patient's life. This is not difficult. If you are willing to listen to the doctor, let us do the following tests: 1. Blood smear specimen, 2. Blood culture, 3. Spleen puncture, 4. Liver puncture, 5. Sternal puncture, 6. Tibial puncture, 7. Lymph node puncture, 8. Napier's Aldehyd test, 9. Antimony test, 10. Globulin sedimentation test, 11. Agglutination test.</p>
<p>After writing so many tests above, are you afraid of danger? Are you afraid of trouble? Don't be afraid! If you want the doctor to give you a definite diagnosis and effective treatment, then you should thank the doctor for spending valuable time doing a detailed and accurate examination to save the patient's life! Increase family happiness!</p>
<h3>An Example of an Accident During a Neck Dissection Under Anesthesia (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Liang Junqing</p>
<p>The patient's breathing was normal, and the lungs had mild bronchitis and pneumonia symptoms. The diagnosis at this time was: retro-pharyngeal honeycomb tissue inflammation complicated by bronchitis and pneumonia. Treatment: Professor Reytier personally presided over the retro-pharyngeal honeycomb tissue inflammation dissection. Half an hour before the operation, 0.02 of morphine and scopolamine were injected first. Because the patient also had bronchitis and pneumonia, the anesthesia method was discussed and studied in detail. Finally, it was decided to use the less dangerous Narconumal intravenous injection method. This anesthesia method was presided over by the most experienced assistant doctor, injecting only one cc per minute. After injecting six cc of the drug, the patient began to calculate vaguely (that is, the mind was no longer very clear). After eight cc, the patient fell into a deep sleep and could not answer inquiries from others. Then another three cc were injected. Immediately, a special tongue depressor was tried (named Vegus, which can depress the tongue and also be used to open the mouth, and can also input Aether for anesthesia), but it was not successful, because the jaw was clenched tightly and could not be inserted. Another cc of the above-mentioned intravenous anesthetic was injected, but it was also ineffective. So 40 cc of ether drip anesthesia was added. At this time, the jaw was loose. So he tried to insert the above-mentioned tongue depressor. Unexpectedly, at this time, the patient suddenly had great difficulty breathing. The patient took a few slight breaths and then stopped breathing. However, the surgery was not stopped because the breathing stopped. The honeycomb tissue inflammation swelling on the posterior pharyngeal wall was immediately dissected, starting from the band-shaped bulge on the left side and cutting down to the lower left corner of the trachea. At this time, a lot of foul-smelling pus was discharged. Artificial respiration was also performed at the same time. The patient's pulse was initially stable and full after breathing stopped, but the heart also stopped beating about ten minutes later. So one cc of Adrenalin was injected into the patient's heart. The heart started beating again about three minutes later. However, the breathing was still stopped. Although respiratory stimulants and cardiotonics (Lobelin &amp; Coramin) had been injected, they were not effective. So artificial respiration was constantly used to call for help. The patient only recovered his first breath twenty minutes after breathing stopped, and then waited another minute before having a second breath. Then the breathing gradually returned to normal within ten minutes. However, the patient had rapid breathing again an hour later, followed by a coma like death. At this time, edema suddenly occurred at the trachea, so the throat was dissected. After inserting the bridge into the throat, the breathing improved, but the patient remained in a coma and did not wake up. The next day, August 11, the patient remained in a coma and did not wake up despite various cardiotonics. There was breathing , however normal. However, the patient's whole body gradually stiffened, sometimes with opisthotonos, and the toes were tightly pulled back. The appearance was like a person whose head had been cut off. The patient died 35 hours after the operation.</p>
<p>Autopsy report. The examiner was Professor Wegelin, Dean of the Institute of Pathology at the University of Bern, Switzerland. Throat: Both tonsils were slightly enlarged, with quite a few folds and red and swollen. There was a surgical wound near the midline of the posterior pharyngeal wall, starting from the lower end of the tonsil and going straight down to near the spine. The posterior pharyngeal area was completely thickened, most of it had rotted, gangrene, foul-smelling, and spread to the apex of the lungs. In addition, the gangrenous lesions had also spread to the branches of the thyroid gland, and there were two millimeter-sized lesions on the upper end of the thyroid, and most of them had rotted. As for the trachea, there was only edema. Other parts were still normal. The large jugular vein on the left side of the neck had been ligated. No thrombosis was found. The lymph nodes in the neck were also about two centimeters in size, but they were very soft when touched. Medical examination report of histological aspects: The left tonsil had obvious bleeding. The connective tissue behind the left tonsil had a high degree of edema, with occasional bleeding, mixed with white blood cells, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Smear examination report of posterior pharyngeal abscess aspirate: There were countless fine Gram-positive deformed cocci, as well as blunt Gram-positive cocci, as well as rod-shaped bacteria, and a small amount of Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria. Brain: The dura mater was taut, thickened, and opaque. There was flowing blood, blood clots, and dark-colored blood spots in the brain cavity. The pia mater was also taut. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebrospinal fluid was clear and not increased. Diencephalon, pituitary gland, and pineal gland were normal. The blood vessels at the base of the brain were thin. Brain weight was 1,300 grams. The cerebral gyri were flattened, and the sulci were narrowed. The width of the brain cavity was normal, and the choroid plexus was also normal. The brain substance was moist and had considerable bleeding. Histological examination report: All blood vessels were dilated and filled with blood. The outer layer of the blood vessel wall was edematous. The edematous change of the dura mater was very severe, and there was a large amount of blood accumulation. The brain substance and meninges had no changes. Autopsy diagnosis result: "The patient had retro-pharyngeal honeycomb inflammation complicated by inflammation of the left thyroid gland. Associated symptoms were tonsillitis, emphysema, pulmonary edema, lobar pneumonia, catarrhal bronchitis, acute splenomegaly, fatty degeneration of the liver, hemorrhage of the outer membrane of the heart, hemorrhage of the entire gastrointestinal mucosa, acute brain swelling, congestion of the pia mater. Liver and kidney degeneration, vague swelling."</p>
<p>The above-mentioned case was investigated and clarified the cause after the autopsy, and it was not prosecuted. The original author, Ms. Graff, expressed the following opinions:</p>
<p>What deserves special attention from our surgeons and otolaryngologists in this case is the interruption of breathing during the anesthesia period. Mr. Dong suddenly experienced respiratory arrest during the period of intravenous general anesthesia before starting to dissect the honeycomb inflammation of the posterior pharynx, which cannot but make people reconsider. Of course, since the person in charge of intravenous anesthesia was an experienced assistant doctor, we cannot suspect any errors in his technique. What we can pay attention to is that breathing suddenly stopped at the moment when a special tongue depressor was placed in the oral cavity. Why is this? This is what we need to study. We all know that when dissecting tonsil hypertrophy, we often use this special tongue depressor in the patient's oral cavity during anesthesia, and we may also encounter the above-mentioned situation of sudden respiratory arrest (especially when the tongue depressor is inserted into the oral cavity and the tongue and the entire jaw are pressed down tightly). Therefore, we must pay special attention when using a mask to inhale ether to anesthetize the patient first, and then want to change to a special tongue depressor to press in ether to continue anesthetizing the patient in order to avoid all kinds of unsatisfactory difficulties, because breathing is prone to difficulty or even sudden cessation at this time. Based on this observation of facts, we deeply feel that after tightly pressing the root of the tongue and the jaw in the oral cavity with a tongue depressor, there must be a reflex action that stimulates the respiratory nerve center to suddenly stop working. We also know that there are many boundaries that can cause the respiratory nerve center to suddenly stop working, such as the mucous membrane of the upper respiratory organs, which is the boundary where reflex action occurs. We can stimulate the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity to cause the above-mentioned situation (stimulating the nasal mucosa of rabbits with electricity can immediately stop breathing). The same is true for stimulating the throat, trachea, and large trachea. Excessive pain can also cause respiratory arrest. Using high-speed sound or stimulating the auditory nerve center can also cause respiratory arrest. Using heat to stimulate the skin can also cause respiratory arrest. If the autonomic nerve is stimulated, the above-mentioned situation can also occur.</p>

<h3>Misplaced Praise</h3>
<p>— Liu Yun</p>
<p>Chou Chi's Notes states: "I used to be in Qixia, and heard that the pork of He was extremely delicious. I sent someone to fetch it, but the messenger was drunk, and the pig escaped at night. He bought another pig to bring back, which I did not know. The guests were all amazed, thinking it was beyond the reach of other products; but later, the matter was revealed, and the guests were all greatly ashamed"! After reading this story, I can't help but feel a thousand emotions! "Buy another pig to bring back, which I did not know." Of course, "A gentleman can be deceived by his principles." But "the guests were all amazed, thinking it was beyond the reach of other products." Then there is really a ghost in the mouth. To put it bluntly, isn't it the inferior nature of completely blindly following and agreeing with those who curry favor with the guests, so as to destroy their conscience? Zi Cai asked: "It is difficult to find a confidant, but it is even more difficult to know the taste"! It can be seen that there have been few truly tasteful people throughout history. If the secret of this "great amazement at being beyond the reach of other products" is not revealed, everyone will still be complacent, thinking that they have truly tasted the delicious pork of Heyang, and will be very happy to eat it and brag about it to others. Once the truth is revealed, everyone will feel embarrassed and their faces will turn red. There are many similar things happening in the world! But I think that knowing "great shame" after "the matter is revealed" is still a sign that there is a "conscience" and "sense of good and evil" existing. What is most fearful is being shameless, and not even blushing, then "sorrow is greater than the death of the heart" and there is no cure. Free Talk Biography John Winant</p>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>Former US Ambassador to the UK John Winant suddenly committed suicide with a pistol at his home in Concord, New Hampshire on the third night. Before his suicide, he had just finished writing his memoirs, "Recollections of Serving in England." According to the forensic doctor, it may have been caused by long-term excessive fatigue and mental disorder.</p>
<p>Those who pay attention to the international situation will always remember this outstanding American diplomat. He took office as Ambassador to the UK when German planes bombed London the most fiercely, and made great contributions to strengthening the ties between the Allied countries and providing various military and economic assistance. In addition, when he served as Governor of New Hampshire three times, the social welfare undertakings he organized and the regulations he promoted, such as old-age subsidies and emergency relief, are still praised by Americans today.</p>
<p>In terms of appearance, Winant's face and figure were very similar to Lincoln's. He was tall, with bright eyes, and even his temperament was very similar: sincere, meticulous, and unkempt. His hair was always messy, his shirt was crumpled, and he never thought of ironing his pants. During his tenure as Ambassador to the UK, London radio stations often broadcast how unruly and unfashionable the US Ambassador was. When Winant's mother heard about this in the United States, she quickly called his daughter-in-law: "Didn't he take any new shirts?" Winant's wife said sadly: "He took a lot, but, as you know, he must have forgotten to change! What can be done!"</p>
<p>Winant was always focused on his work and was not good at socializing at all. In London, he rarely appeared in social gatherings. He liked to lock himself in his office, take off his jacket, hold it in his hand, and pace back and forth with his head down, pondering a problem that needed to be solved urgently. After he figured out the problem, his jacket must have fallen on the floor and been trampled beyond recognition. He was so busy with his work, every day from morning until late at night, and without any vacations. If it is said that his suicide this time was indeed caused by excessive work and mental disorder, it is not without basis.</p>
<p>Winant came from a wealthy American family and had a lot of money. He worked as a history professor at St. Paul's School. After the First European War, he married Ms. Russell, a wealthy woman from Princeton. After marriage, he focused on his career. Everyone ridiculed him as a bookworm, a "progressive" element, and a guy who got rich off his wife's money, but he didn't care and bravely participated in the election for parliamentarian.</p>
<p>He had terrible speaking skills and a very slow tone. During the election campaign, when he gave his first speech, he went on stage and stammered, unable to say a single word, which made his wife faint on the spot, but the audience was impressed by his honesty and his election was victorious.</p>
<p>No matter how clumsy his appearance was, his sincere spirit would shine. Everyone who came into contact with him supported him. He won the governorship of New Hampshire three times, and those who competed with him for the election, such as former Secretary of the Navy Knox, were far behind.</p>
<p>Another reason why he was supported was that he liked to be close to the people. Anyone could go to his office and talk to him for two hours, and he would put aside all his official duties. Moreover, he liked to help people. Once, he attended an important meeting in New York as governor. On the way to the train station, a ragged woman asked him for money. He gave her all the money in his pocket. When he arrived at the station, he realized that he didn't even have the money to buy a train ticket, so he borrowed money from a stranger.</p>
<p>People in New Hampshire once said: "If the governor invites you to dinner, you must bring money and then lend it to him so that he can pay the bill." — Winant was such a person.</p>
<p>Although he personally could not manage money, during his tenure as governor, he was able to reform finance and adopt the latest budget system, with remarkable results.</p>
<p>He also served as Director of the Social Security Administration and Director of the International Labor Office in Geneva. When the war between Britain and Germany became tense, President Roosevelt specially appointed him to be the envoy to Britain. When the war ended, he served as the US representative on the European Supervisory Committee. This year, he was appointed by Truman as the permanent representative of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. He is 58 years old this year.</p>
<p>Whether Winant's suicide was indeed caused by mental disorder as the forensic doctor judged, or was based on other reasons, it is certainly impossible to guess at present, but it is always very regrettable for the death of such an extraordinary statesman.</p>
<h3>Rooster Crows</h3>
<p>— Hulu</p>
<p>Roosters laying eggs have been reported many times.</p>
<p>Women turning into men and men turning into women, it is said that surgery can be done, I wonder if our country is more civilized, roosters laying eggs have been seen many times!</p>
<p>The times are now reversed, everything is turned upside down, strange yin and yang are all over the world, I am afraid there will be less rooster crowing and more dog thieving!</p>
<h3>Autumn in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Sha Lan</p>
<p>Autumn is deep, which makes me miss the old capital even more. Of the four seasons, only autumn is the best time in Beijing. Spring is often windy, summer is continentally hot, and winter is severely cold, which are not ideal weather conditions. But in autumn, the sky is clear and the air is crisp, which is much more comfortable than the bitter rain in the south of the Yangtze River at this time. Autumn is the season when everything ripens, and peanuts, chestnuts, persimmons, and sweet potatoes are both economical and delicious foods. At the same time, after the Beginning of Autumn, you can enjoy the open-air barbecue, which is a flavor that cannot be enjoyed outside of Beijing. Taking a small stove to Fragrant Hills and picking pine branches to barbecue is even more fun in the mountains.</p>
<p>The fat crabs of Shengfang are also something that makes people think. As early as before the Yangcheng Lake crabs in the south of the Yangtze River were displayed on the streets, the vegetable markets in Xidan or Dongdan had already displayed "overbearing crabs." Of course, from an economic point of view, it is most cost-effective to buy them at Xihuyuan Street near Qianmen.</p>
<p>Southerners like to boast about osmanthus trees in the north, but in fact, in addition to the fragrant and fragrant smell, osmanthus trees have no ornamental value. Among the autumn plants, chrysanthemums are still the best. Not to mention the chrysanthemums of the old capital, Zhu Ziqing's "Chrysanthemums of Tsinghua Garden" has long been well-known. In addition to Tsinghua, the chrysanthemums in the park and the National Beiping Library are also very precious, with many treasures. "Seeing peonies" in the park in spring and Tie Tian's "Appreciating Chrysanthemums" are both fun things to do at that time. It's just that the hills are barren and the situation is chaotic, and everyone is worried about "getting a high position" in time, and I am afraid that not many people have this elegant interest.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, when the white clouds are floating high and the blue sky guarantees that you will not have any wind or rain, and you are wearing a lined shirt that is neither too cold nor too hot, don't you really want to go out for a walk? Near the park Beihai, far away from the Temple of Heaven Summer Palace, if you have poetic and picturesque inspiration, masterpieces will be produced. At the very least, you can wander and relax in your own garden. If you can't create, you can just recite and chant from memory to dispel your worries. However, in Shanghai, this kind of climate is difficult to enjoy. When you look up, you see tall buildings, and when you look down, you see crowded crowds. Needless to say, your inspiration has dissipated and your poetic inspiration has fled. Ah, this is the depression of city dwellers.</p>
<h3>On Chestnuts</h3>
<p>— Shu Shang</p>
<p>Both chestnuts and persimmons are fruits of the North. Those produced in the North are smaller, but their sweetness surpasses those from other regions. In the North, chestnuts are most abundantly produced in the three counties of Changping, Licheng, and Zouping. Currently, the most famous are the chestnuts from Liangxiang. Zhejiang Province also produces a considerable amount of chestnuts, with Mingji, Linhai, Dongyang, and Longquan being the most abundant counties. However, in terms of taste, they ultimately fall short of those produced in the aforementioned northern counties. This is likely due to differences in soil.</p>
<p>While in Chongqing, I once tasted the Tianshi chestnuts from Qingcheng Mountain. Their appearance is the same as ordinary chestnuts, but each shell contains only one nut. When eaten, they have an exceptionally sweet taste. Tianshi chestnuts are only produced on Qingcheng Mountain and nowhere else. It is said that this type was planted during the time Zhang Tianshi was studying the Tao. The annual yield is very small, and only people in the Chongqing Zhang County area can get to eat them.</p>
<p>To plant chestnuts, one must wait until the chestnuts are initially ripe and the shells emerge. Then, immediately wrap them and bury them in moist soil, taking care not to expose them to the wind, as exposure will prevent germination. By the third month of the following year, the chestnuts will begin to sprout and grow. Once they have grown slightly, they can be transplanted to another location. Avoid using palm sap immersion for several years. Every year in October, tightly wrap them with straw and untie them in February. Chestnuts are northern trees, but they are still very susceptible to the cold.</p>
<p>Chestnuts and olives, thinly sliced and mixed together, have an exceptionally delicious flavor when eaten together. People call it "Plum Blossom Delight." Yam, sliced together with chestnuts and then stewed with lamb broth and seasonings, is called "Golden Jade Soup," and is also a delicious dish in late autumn and early winter.</p>
<p>The largest chestnuts are called Banli (plate chestnuts), followed by Shanli (mountain chestnuts). Mountain chestnuts that are round with a pointed tip are called Zhuili (cone chestnuts). Small, round chestnuts resembling acorns are called Xinli. Those as small as a finger are called Maoli (thatch chestnuts). The variety of chestnuts is so diverse, even in such small differences.</p>
<p>Chestnuts nourish the kidneys. People with weak waists and legs can eat more than ten sun-dried chestnuts every morning, followed by two bowls of pork kidney porridge. Results can be seen after half a month. Su Dongpo's younger brother, Su Ziyou, ate this kind of tonic, and even wrote a poem saying: "Growing old, I add to my waist and leg ailments, the old mountain man takes the chestnut's old recipe, guests come to tell me morning and evening, three swallows slowly receive the white jade nectar." This is a master of eating chestnuts.</p>
<p>To be intimate with the emperor relies entirely on eloquence. The biography of Xiao Chen in the History of the Liang Dynasty states: "Emperor Wu of Liang had a long-standing relationship with Chen in the Western Residence. The Emperor always received Chen at morning banquets. Chen, due to his old friendship, often attended the imperial banquets. Once, he became drunk and fell. The Emperor threw a persimmon at Chen. Chen then took a chestnut and threw it back, hitting the Emperor directly in the face. The Censorate Adjutant was present. The Emperor, showing a change in color, said: 'There are people here; you must not do such a thing. Is there any explanation?' Chen immediately replied: 'Your Majesty throws your red heart at me; how dare I not repay you with trembling?' Emperor Wu then laughed with delight." This shows the importance of eloquence.</p>
<h3>Shuang Qing's Exquisite Poetry</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>The female historian Bian Qing has immeasurable talent. I once recorded her entire poem "Remembering the Xiao Played on the Phoenix Terrace" with repeated characters, which is a testament to her skill. Now, I will record one of her Xiang Geng Ci (Plowing Songs) in which each line contains the word "spring." It is beautiful, elegant, and without any forced feeling. The poem reads:</p>
<p>"Purple fields, spring clear, slowly wrap in spring gauze, self-supply spring plowing, small plum spring slender, fine grass spring bright, spring field step by step spring grows; remember that year the spring was good, towards the spring swallows, spoke of spring love, until now, thinking of spring letters, spring tears, all turned to spring ice. Pity the spring, ache for the spring, how many springs, by a piece of spring mist, locked in spring shock, give to spring embrace, pass to spring you, is I, is you, spring spirit, count the spring beginning, spring end, also difficult to count the spring dream, spring awakening, what spring demon, make a spring spring illness, spring mistook Shuang Qing."</p>
<p>The entire poem contains only one hundred and four characters, divided into twenty-two lines, and uses twenty-nine "spring" characters. "Spring" truly comes from heaven.</p>
<h3>Byrnes Reveals: The Secrets of the Big Four Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>On July 2, Secretary of War Stimson presented a memorandum with insightful views to the President, laying the groundwork for an ultimatum to Japan. Based on this memorandum, the President drafted a joint declaration of the United States, Britain, and China. The President and I repeatedly deliberated, and several suggestions from Prime Minister Churchill were also adopted. This declaration, agreed upon by Churchill, outlined the essentials based on Secretary Stimson's proposal, except for the issue of the future status of the Japanese Emperor, which was not addressed. This proposed declaration was sent to Chiang Kai-shek for signature.</p>
<p>Soon after, Churchill and Winant returned to England, and President Truman also took this opportunity to visit the headquarters of the American occupation zone in Frankfurt, and I followed along. When we returned to the "Little White House" that evening, two telegrams were waiting for the President. One was Ambassador Winant's report of the surprising news of Churchill's election defeat, and the second was Marshal Chiang Kai-shek's approval of what is now called the Potsdam Declaration. This declaration was immediately released and made public, and a copy was sent by special envoy to Mr. Molotov.</p>
<p>Late that night, Mr. Molotov called, requesting that the declaration be delayed for two or three days. When he was told that the declaration had already been announced, he seemed troubled. The next day, I explained to him that the reason we had not sent the declaration to him before it was released was because we did not want to make it difficult for the Soviet Union to issue a declaration to a country it had not yet fought against. He did not say that he hoped to make any revisions, but simply said that we should have consulted with him first.</p>
<p>Two days later, on July 29, Mr. Molotov visited again. Originally, it was decided that the President and I would meet with him and Marshal Stalin, but Molotov told us that Stalin was ill that day. He instructed Molotov to discuss with us the direct reasons for the Soviet Union's entry into the war. Molotov said: The Soviet government believes that it would be best for the United States, Britain, and other united nations to formally request the Soviet Union to enter the war. He added that the Soviet government certainly believes that a treaty should be concluded with the Chinese government before entering the war.</p>
<p>This request was a problem for us. The Soviet Union had already signed a non-aggression pact with Japan, and the Soviet government had also signed a similar treaty with Hitler, but it was the Nazi Party that broke this treaty. We did not believe that the US government should ask other governments to violate agreements without good and sufficient reason. The Soviet Union had notified Japan several months ago that it did not intend to renew the treaty, but it was still in effect for almost a year. The President was troubled by this.</p>

<h3>Reader's Mailbox How Should Overseas Chinese Deposits Be Repaid?</h3>
<p>Editor: The method of repaying pre-war deposits has been passed by the State Council and will be announced after the Legislative Yuan completes the legislative procedures on the 7th of this month. However, I am deeply surprised that no preferential repayment methods have been formulated for deposits made by overseas Chinese using foreign exchange converted into legal tender before the outbreak of the Pacific War. As a representative of the overseas Chinese press, in addition to submitting this to the heads of relevant agencies, I would like to use your newspaper's precious space to express the grievances of our overseas compatriots who have suffered losses.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, overseas Chinese provided a steady stream of foreign exchange to support the central government, launched large-scale fundraising and donations, and enthusiastically underwrote national salvation bonds, demonstrating their loyalty to the Party and their patriotism.</p>
<p>Before the Pacific War, the Singapore Overseas Chinese Bank repeatedly appealed to overseas Chinese to use British currency to convert into national currency for deposit, in order to enrich the national treasury and increase the strength of the Anti-Japanese War, and declared that it would guarantee the principal and offer generous interest, and would bear the trust responsibility. At that time, the overseas Chinese were motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, and in addition to saving money and generously donating to charity, they also transferred funds originally stored in foreign banks to the Bank of China and converted them into national currency. Many even sold part of their property to save money, because they had great confidence in the government's credit.</p>
<p>As soon as the Pacific War broke out, the various islands of Southeast Asia successively fell, and the city banks hastily withdrew, so all overseas Chinese deposits have been frozen to this day.</p>
<p>Based on the above situation, the government repeatedly claims to care for overseas Chinese, and now we can only wait for the facts to be demonstrated. Our request is very simple: please take into account the sincerity of overseas Chinese who used foreign exchange to deposit national currency in the past, and repay the original amount of foreign exchange without interest (in the 29th and 30th years of the Republic of China, every 1,000 yuan of national currency deposit was equivalent to about 200 US dollars). If the current foreign exchange position is tight, a special multiple repayment method in legal tender should also be established, because most of these deposits are the hard-earned savings of ordinary overseas Chinese who have worked like oxen and horses in foreign countries for many years. The Bank of China must also keep its promises, so as not to be regarded as a terrible trap.</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the so-called funds for the repatriation of overseas Chinese, although ultimately a fruitless show, we have never dared to utter a single complaint because we sympathize with the country's economic difficulties. However, if these deposits are swallowed up invisibly and completely, we will launch a petition protest and ask the national media to uphold justice. Sincerely, with respectful greetings! Executive Committee of the Overseas Chinese Fundraising Association of Various Regions of Southeast Asia. Li Junxia, special correspondent of the Singapore Sin Chew Daily and the Hong Kong Sing Tao Daily, stationed in Beijing and Shanghai. November 3.</p>
