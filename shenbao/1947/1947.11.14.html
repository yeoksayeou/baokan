<h3>美國當局意見一致　援華程序在研究中　詳細計劃將提明正國會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十三日廣播：華盛頓訊，衆議員蘭恩特要求國務院發天壤懸隔魏德邁報吿。蘭氏相信，該項報吿必然主張立即以充份援助給予中國政府者。渠謂：「蔣主席及其政府雖有種種缺點，但仍為東方防止共產主義之唯一屛障」。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕國務卿馬歇爾十二日在記者招待會上稱：對中國國民政府擴大基礎一事，美國仍存有希望，渠稱：關於此事，美國是否將向中國政府提出任何新建議，尙未有所決定。國務院希望在明年一月國會召開常會時，將關於援華之確切建議凖備完竣，提交國會，渠認為在該時以後國會採取行動，不致費時太久。記者謁問馬歇爾謂：關於對華救濟事，是否將附有「政治建議」向華提出，馬卿稱：渠對該問題現尙不能答覆。關於中國政府取締民盟一事，渠亦拒絕評論。馬歇爾吿提出詢問者稱：關於中國問題，渠等應注意兩項因素，此即中國人民及共產黨是也，渠稱：在若干地區，此兩者有密切關係，而在其他地區則否。有一記者稱：在去年，曾有對華救濟物資運之事發生，此事是否有再發生可能，馬歇爾答稱：未來之救濟物資，由於上海港口情形在過去數月中大為改善，不致引起此種情况發生。渠稱：大量之供應品，係經滬運入中國者，渠並未接獲堆棧擁濟之消息。渠稱：渠未讀到新加坡方面之一項新聞，內稱魏德邁曾建議將中國劃分為三部，對此消息，渠拒絕評論。馬歇爾說明渠所提及之三億美元援華數字尙未最後決定之原因謂：因參議員范登堡曾向提出關於援華問題，渠約略提出此項估計。渠稱：美行政當局現正設法決定援華之最佳辦法，程序正在硏究中。渠並說明現在考慮中之方案，係為一項有助中國解除通貨膨脹之壓力者，馬歇爾透露，渠曾在一九四六年八月，本年一月及二月，以及本年八月渠赴巴西京城不久前，向進出口銀行，設法為中國取得基金。記者詢以該銀行對於貨款要求，是否不甚表示同情，渠答稱：渠意並不如此，渠指出，該銀行之章程，對於貸未或信用借款，須對歸還之可能性獲有把握，此點有嚴格規定。馬歇爾稱：中國過去對該行所提出之計劃，對中國內戰具有若干軍事價値，渠指出，該各種計劃係為平漢路善後，復興上海公用事業，中國煤礦業善後，以及改建者若干港口之計劃。渠繼稱：該項建議中之計劃，對於中國經濟開發，將屬重要。對建議中之援華，是否係根據聯總規定分配於國民政府及共黨所轄區域一點，拒絕有所說明。（美衆院外委會辯論刋二版左角）</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十二日電〕共和黨議員周以德稱：「美國援華計劃如左明年四月以前不能見諸實行，恐將不及。深望馬歇爾此種計劃能為眞正援助中國之開端，惟一切尙未確定。兩三年以來，國會方面一向贊成援華，惟國務院方面未能合作，現在基本需要即在其內戰中援助中國，戰勝共產黨，防止通貨膨脹，中國內戰一旦結束，其預算即可於一年之內獲得平衡。國會對馬歇爾建議如何表決，尙難預測，惟此建議至少為國務院已認識此種需要，余望即能決定切實行動程序」</p>
<h3>馬歇爾所稱援華計劃　我政府尙未獲悉　董顯光在招待會上宣稱</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕關於馬歇爾國務卿在美國國會外委會聯席會議中所稱：國務院將向國會提出援華計劃，在本會計年度內以三億一千八百萬美元援助中國一事，政院新聞局長董顯光於記者招待會中答記者問稱：「中國政府尙未獲悉馬歇爾此項聲明之詳情，故本人並無意見發表」。據記者獲悉，美國援華之保證，早經馬卿向王外長之壓迫，而不得不向國會外委會作公開具體之保證，然此種保證實極渺茫，不論中國政府或美國人民對之均不能有所滿足，目前之癥結，在實現援助時間之早遲問題，而非紙面或口頭之數字允許。中國之局勢需援極為迫切，馬卿之保證，實違永不能救近火，故馬卿之聲明，並不若以前羅斯福及杜魯門為申受人歡迎。南京產外交部數日來堅決不透露中國政府是否對之歡迎，而董局長終致宣示一推諉之沉默。同時，美國方面若干主張援華人士與馬卿之爭辯，亦將愈趨熾烈。馬卿現正面臨考騐，渠主持下之美國外交政策是否公正，而使美國人民認為安全滿足胥賴此後行動決定。</p>
<h3>本市中外商界對美援華意見</h3>
<p>〔聯合社本市訊〕上海商界與金融界人士稱：馬歇爾計劃聯想結束後對華三億餘美元之援助，可使中國免於破產，但欲復興戰後中國之交通與工業則完全不夠。援助總數可以低消其外匯之虧蝕，本屆財政年度之虧蝕大約為一億九千萬美元，且可使南京政府輸入必要之食物，棉花，肥料，煤油，汽油與機器油。政府對於此種臨時援助自當表示欣慰，但對於不規定較大數目用於主要計劃之發展，定必極感失望，所謂主要計劃，如交通電力，肥料廠及各種得輕工業。</p>
<p>此間外國商界領袖推測，馬歇爾不願將中國列入復興程序之內，一如對歐洲之所為，起因於渠承認內戰無立即結束之象，此刻從事長期復興計劃徒勞無益。倘和平一旦實現，則華盛頓方面可望援助中國復興，但目前殆覺最多只有援助南京政府免於垮台。目下對華援助較有希望者，在於供給充分食物，在沿海各城市實行給。另一希望則為政府之外匯基金可以保持，軍事需要亦可不必肖减而已。</p>
<h3>對日和會問題我國態度不變　美與中蘇續交換意見</h3>
<p>〔路透社南京十三日電〕外部發言人稱：中國決不因蘇聯之反對中國為德國和會召集國而變更其對於日本和會之態度。中國政府仍維持王外長於數週前聲明之立塲，即日本和約應先由四强討論。蘇聯在倫敦外長會中對中國表示之態度，並不影響中國對日本和會之態度。按倫敦報吿曾謂，該地外交觀察家預料，於蘇聯反對中國為對德和約會議召集國後，中國可能變更其對於日本和會之態度，外部發言人之聲明，意在答覆此一報吿。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十二日電〕馬歇爾國務卿於記者招待會中稱：過去一月中關於召開對日和會一事未有進展，美國現仍與中·蘇兩國政府交換有關對日和約協同程序之意見。</p>
<h3>美以經濟援華有助物價穩定　財次徐柏圖在全經會報吿</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕財次徐柏園十三日出席全經會時，曾報吿目前上海之物價及金融狀况，指出最近上海市塲因傳美國貸款即成功，已見好轉，金鈔皆下跌，將來貸款成功，當更可有助於物價穩定。</p>
<h3>全經會例會</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十三日電〕全國經濟委會十三日下午三時舉行例會，主要討論為赴滬調查物價之三委員建議案，其中關於引導游資納入正軌部外，決定交部酌量辦理。各委員咸認為緊縮信用，正當運用資金，管制金融市塲諸端，為最適當步驟，深盼財政當局予以嚴格執行。關於稅制改進部分，交由財政小組委員俞鴻鈞·張嘉　·黃元彬·蕭錚·施奎齡等七人再行硏究。財政經濟政策部份，各委員發表意見頗多，惟未作決定。引導國人在外存款購買機器器材部分，交由輸管會先行研究，再作決定。會中對花紗布聯合配銷聯合購棉問題，曾提出討論，然因關係重大，執行困難，待從長計議後再作硏究。其次，經濟改革方案實施辦法之工業商業交通三部份，業巳擬就，並經秘書處整理完竣，提會討論時，各委員一致主張，先由各委員審閱後再行召集一專門大會，愼重研討。雙秘書處於十三日會議時，曾作下列報吿：　經濟部所擬該部投資事業重估價値標凖，全經會已擬具意見，行政院照辦。　中美農業按術合作計劃，政院巳通過。　卅七年度糧食增產計劃，政院亦已通過。</p>

<p>〔中央社南京十三日電〕民社黨將再度修正之國代候選人名單，今午交雷震副秘書長與張壽賢秘書轉達國民黨，名額為廿一人，但全部名單總數仍為一九一人。徐傳霖，　翼翹，蔣勻田昨午謁蔣主席時，主席曾面允就該黨前所提之一九一名候選人名單中可再修正十五名，連前此國民黨所答應讓予之十五名共為卅名。徐氏對主席此項答復表示滿意，然認為國民黨前此所安排之一九一人中有廣西邊境（毗鄰安南）之五縣治之人應予修正，蓋此等地區並無民社黨員競選，故應變更，以其他地區補足，即連蔣主席所答應之十五人共為廿一人。今午雷震，張壽賢往訪徐氏時，渠即將此廿一名單交雷張二氏，轉達國民黨，但全部名單總數不變，仍為一九一人。國民黨方面陳立夫，余井塘，馬超俊，王啓江，鄭彥棻等，今日下午曾就此事作初步商硏，明日可能提出中央常會討論。</p>

<h3>美國援華計劃的檢討</h3>
<p>美國國會定於本月十七日舉行特別會議，商討當前迫切之援歐援華問題，參衆兩院外交委員會先於十一日開會，聽取國務卿馬歇爾之呼籲儘速援助曾受戰災之各國。關於中國的一部份，馬歇爾國務卿表示國務院切盼援助中國，擬要求國會撥款三億美元援華，並謂：「通貨膨脹問題爲中國之難題，必須助其改善；而中國政府亦應採取防止通貨膨脹之步驟，俾使吾人給予中國之援助，能獲得至少百分之七十的效果。」我們聽了馬歇爾國務卿的這一番言論，覺得美國援華問題，雙方尙有加以檢討的必要。</p>
<p>最近美國與論界，不論是報章雜誌所發表的言論，或是美國一般人民所表示的意見，對於中國的態度，都有一種明顯的變更，尤其自蒲立德先生的「訪華觀感」一文，在生活雜誌發表之後，引起全國朝野普遍的注意。我們檢討一下最近一個月來美國人士所發表的議論，就可以知道美國國內一致同情中國的呼籲，並由「關切」進而爲「焦急」了。大家都主張立即全面援助中國，援華計劃與援歐計劃，應同時提交國會討論，俾美國在歐亞兩方面採取兼顧平衡安定之政策。司徒大使、魏德滬將軍曁國會議員范登堡、馬丁、周以德諸君，都能高瞻遠矚，作此主張。但在今日之美國，尙有一小部份的人士，主張「歐洲第一遠東次之」，美國應光援歐，以對付蘇聯在東歐勢力之擴張；然後再援助中國。他們所特的理由類具狹隘觀念，但頗能迎合若干對問題認識欠充分者之惰性。美國外交當局在這爾種意見的夾縫中，究將何去何從？固有待馬歇　國務卿的抉擇？但是我們看了馬帥前天發表的書論，他說：「中國局勢與歐洲局勢不同，歐洲需要緊急援助，以防重要貨物之輸入，陷於停頓，否則即將發生饑饉與工業破產；惟中國問題不同，中國之輸入並不遭遇立　　於停頓之威脅，且中國自有其資源。」這里，馬卿殆已多少受到後項意見的影響。</p>
<p>時至今日，美國援華問題，可能成爲民主共和兩黨競選總統的主題之一，共和黨領袖范登堡因已堅決主張，應將由國列入美國援外範圍以內，紐約州長杜威最近亦發表演說，也指責杜魯門總統置中國盟友於不　。共和黨衆議員周以德自遠東返國後，更是犬聲疾呼，指出麥帥之最大煩惱，厭爲中國局勢。就是共和黨總統競選人塔虎特也主張援華重於援歐，他說：「美國在考慮援歐之前，應先考慮援華之建議。」由此可知，共和　領袖援華主張之積極，已坦率揭示於美國國民之前。但是我們平心而論，杜魯門總統與馬歇爾國務卿對於援助中國一事，在原則上也已經確立經緯了：蓋因援華即等於援助美國自己，這點，凡是到過遠東的美國人，莫不有此認識，蒲立德如此，周以德也如此。我們相信，不論是中國人或是美國人。對於蒲周一氏的觀點，無不表示同感。以目前的建東局勢而論，中美的利害實完全一致，援華即等於援美，已成爲不刋之定輪。此在杜魯門總統與馬歇爾國務卿，也必能有此認識。馬卿答覆共和黨衆議員富爾頓間話也說：「中國的安定，對於美國及世界，均極重要。」就是一個很好的證明。惟援華問題的重點，乃在如何始能奏效？馬鄉說：「美國政府希望此次援助能發生效力，」可謂一語破的。我們認爲美國援華，有如醫生之用藥，不僅須「及時」，而且藥的分量也要「恰到好處。」過了時，藥就會失效；分量不足，也就等於零。據馬卿的援華計劃，分爲兩部份：　美國在明年七月一日以前，以六千萬美元援助中國；　在明年六月三十日以後，每月以二千萬美元援助中國，至一九四九年七月一日爲止。總額爲二億美元。準此而論，美援不僅不能「及時」，而且分量也顯感不足。若量旣不足，而援又失時，則抱願雖宏，欲其奏效，豈不難哉？馬卿尙欲以此三億美元協助中國改善幣制，盛意縱可感，但「希望發生效力」恐未易言也。</p>
<p>雖然，我們若從另一角度去觀察，馬歇爾國務卿因鑒於中國通貨膨脹的情形，乃擬定了這個援華計劃，提交國會特別會議討論，俾使中國政府與人民，均能獲得實惠，這種盛情與美意，終是値得我們稱道的。同時，我們自己也應該乘此深切反省一下，我國政府與人民，更應先努力求其自助。所謂「天助自助」，我們一定要先求自助，乃能得到友邦之助，我們千萬不能再存着依賴外援的心理而不求自力更生。國人在心理上首先應該發動一次自肅運動，以消滅這種不長進的「依賴外援」的觀念，馬鄉的計劃以「及時」與「分量」兩個角度去觀察，固然難使美國援助有效，但若我們如能一本「自力更生」之堅決信念，切實推行自己的計劃，並能表現出可以使美援有效，則當美國國會討論馬歇爾援華計劃時，共和黨議員必將羣起力爭，修正馬歇爾計劃，使其能及時與有效。所以美國援助中國問題的重心，可以說關鍵仍在我國政府與人民的身上。</p>
<h3>共匪謀達「三求」政策　全國軍民應提高警覺</h3>
<p>「上接一版」鄧氏於報吿戰局前云：由於共匪老巢根據地，已被擊破，關外補給斷絕，匪割據區域兵源糧食都已枯竭，被迫實行空心戰術之後，已動員其全部力量，在總反攻口號之下渡過黃河，流　長江以北地區，　　達到求兵，求　。求食，破壊交通，擴充實力就地補給自的，這種陰謀詭計，是値得全國軍民警覺的。</p>
<p>兩個月來，共匪在黃河以南，長江以北的到處流竄，避免同國軍主力決戰，旋磨打圈，鑽隙竄擾，其求衣求食求兵的目的，由於國軍避免兵力分散，未能處處駐兵，人民毫無自衛力量，業已達到一部份，因之人民生命財產的損失極大，衣服被刦掠，糧食被分配，更被强迫參軍的事實，不可勝計。共匪得到一時喘息的機會，最近又在發動宣傳攻勢，說將要流竄過長江南岸來。</p>
<p>長江不比黃河，股匪偷渡不易，但鑒於共匪在魯。蘇。豫。鄂。皖的竄擾，把人民賴以生活的衣服糧食儘量的刦奪，又强迫裹脅着每一壯年人民參軍，黨民伕，我們爲要打破共匪繼續擴大流竄，同求衣求食求兵的「三求」戰術，我們要防患未然，爲免匪竄到時，生活生命都被毀滅，祗有全國軍民，都提高警覺，加强動員，消滅當前共匪，如此民主自由，方能得到確實保障。</p>
<p>打破匪的三求戰術，祗有澈底實行總動員，有匪流竄區域的政府要儘量實行戰時體制，政治要切實配合軍事，人民都耍開始過戰時生活，如何加强地方人民自衛的力量，如何集中糧食，管制物資，使匪不能任意脅迫人民參軍，當民伕，不能隨便求衣求食，就地補給，都是當前的急務，而且必須軍政民一致，迅速切實的實施，方才可以有效的阻止匪過長江，國軍如能得到政治民衆的合力，就可集中力量，逐漸消滅匪於長江以北黃河以南。</p>
<h3>陳誠訓詞內容</h3>
<p>「上接一版」工業生產原爲九百萬噸，現僅一百廿五萬噸，約佔百分之十四，礦業出產原爲三千萬噸，現儘六百萬噸，約佔百分之廿。發電力原爲一百七十一萬基羅瓦特，現僅二十一萬基羅瓦特，約佔百分之十二八。八至於鐵路里程原爲一萬一千一百公里，現僅一千七百五十餘公里，約佔百分之十五，運輸力量原爲六百五十萬噸，現僅五十一萬噸，約佔百分之七。七，而最近被共匪所破壊之數字，尙未計入，故就一般所理想的發展，即欲恢復到原來的基礎，恐亦非短期內所能做到，故東北在軍事未展開以前，徒作無計劃的建設，只有增加財政負担，且在水電未恢復前，動力缺乏，復工更難。同時，後方交通時斷時續，生產物資大量交流，自爲環境所不許可，而提倡國內外投資與利用日本賠償機器，亦非短期內可辦。陳氏繼提出四點，以爲確定今後工作重心之參考，第一：剿除共匪，收復失地，統一全國，以確保領土主權的完整，乃前期革命中，民族主義所未曾究全貫澈的主要部分，亦爲和平建設的先決條件，後期革命的首要任務，　爲戡亂平逆，與共匪作全力的鬥爭。共匪在軍事上所謂第六次攻勢，雖已失敗，但吾人在政治，經濟上，尙須加緊進剿，根木消減，絕對不許再有第七次攻勢。在些繼讀鬥爭過程中，吾人尤須特別注意共匪的挑撥離間，與其文化的毒計，而互相攻訐。第二：政治方面推進地方自治，組訓民衆。健全基層政治組織，以奠定憲政基礎。此外，並應注意者：　各省市縣府不得離轄境，如至情況萬分惡劣時，得化整爲零組織政治工作隊，保持密切聯緊，繼績咱開門爭。　爲變前項目的，各省市政府組織，應成爲戰鬥體。第三：實施民生主義經濟，努力增加生產，力求合理分配，今後切措施，首以確保東北生產及資源，不爲敵人利用，爲量低限度要求。第四，發展文化，普及教育，確立三民主義思想，以提高人民對國家民族與政府的信心，令後東北亦可試行計劃敎</p>
<h3>平申滙暴漲</h3>
<p>「本報北平十三日電」今平市各行申匯暴漲，高達九十元，此次漲風係由天津領導，國行申匯掛價已自十一日起調整至四十五元，而隋水已達一倍，一般推測，或與此次遠期外匯停售有關，因遠期外匯停售，象徵外匯近期即將漲，故金鈔百貨無不上湧，此外石莊戰事亦有影響。</p>

<h3>美衆院外交委會中激烈辯論援華問題　魏德邁報告可能部份公開</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓十二日電〕國務卿馬歇爾十二日稱：全部魏德邁報吿可能永不發表，因「予認爲將該項報吿發表，對於中國政府，或對於美國政府，皆屬無利可霄」。馬歇爾出席衆院外交委員會，對該會警吿稱：目前緊急援助佔計爲五億九千七百萬美元，惟如國會處理此項援歐問題遷延過久，則可能有增加之必要。惟馬歇爾謂：魏德邁報吿之若十部分，最後可能公諸大衆。渠稱：國務院現正從事該項工作。馬氏此項聲明，係由共和黨衆議員富爾頓經過連續之質問而始發表者，富爾頓稱：渠欲獲悉魏德邁報吿，何時發表。馬歇爾稱，「中國之穩定，對於美國及世界，皆極屬軍要無疑」。然渠繼稱，「援報問題，係一極複雜之問題，欲使美國之援助有效，中國有不少應爲之事」。馬歇爾稱，渠對魏德邁之若干結論，亦有不能同意者，惟鄭重聲明此非渠禁止魏　邁報吿發表之理由，富爾頓質問稱：國務院是否欲向國會請求授華而不供給充分之事實，渠認爲此項政策並非聰明之辦法。馬歇爾答稱：「有關此類國際事件，不能將一切事實公開，此事幾使一切談判成爲不可能。甚多事實，除能吿諸若干極可靠之人外，不能發表」。在周以德企圖深究計劃中之援華問題時，曾發生激烈之辯論與質間。該項辯論，由於紐約民主黨衆議員勃魯姆提出反對而吿結束。但周以德說明，如遠東局勢繼趨惡化，渠對援歐成功，深致懐疑。周以德甫於上週，自中國及遠東各地漫遊後返國，渠稱：巾國政府負責人士欲知美國何以在中國之反共戰爭中，不于渠等以援助。周以德稱：中國人士對渠詢問者，有下五項問題：</p>
<p>種族問題，是否與美國態度有關係。</p>
<p>美國是否仍相信中共僅係改造家，而不受克里姆林宮之指揮。</p>
<p>美國是否相信中國問題畢竟係不重要者。</p>
<p>美國是否認爲中國局勢不若歐洲之危殆。</p>
<p>中國政府不問在戰爭期間抑在此以後，是否未能對美國盡其義務。</p>
<p>馬歇爾答稱：比類問題殊屬「不可思議」，美國從未想及種族問題。渠稱：中國安定對美國十分重要，美國從未忽視，此已不成問題，全部問題係屬美國在實際上究係採取何種行動之問題。渠繼稱：「此爲予平生所遭遇之最困難及最複雜局勢之一，然予並不完全悲觀，而認爲吾人仍能覓得一項解決辦法」。</p>
<p>周以德稱：「予感對中國政府表明態度，說明如渠等與吾人合作，吾人將予以援助，此一行動實屬重要之舉」。馬歇爾率直答稱：「予不願在此間對中國政府有所批評」，至此，勃魯起而反對稱：討論已遠離本委員會討論援歐問題之本題。</p>
<p>在此以前，馬歇爾吿委員會稱：國務院如不能更早，至遲擬於明年一月國會重開時，將救濟中國案淮備完竣。渠稱：國務院自去年以來，即在尋爲援華之實際辦法，但發現大部分解決辦法，皆係「十分不切責際者」。</p>
<p>周以德提出質問稱：馬歇爾十一日所提出之援助計劃大綱，在中國軍事情勢　續如目前之狀况時，是否係屬適當者。馬歇爾答稱：除非中國之軍喜費用减少，確然難以找出任何能對華有利益之辦法，此即中國局勢中最具破壊性之事實。周以德質問稱：如華北及東北受中共控制，則此事是否將與美國之利益及外交政策相反乎？馬歇爾答稱。「子意正屬如斯」。同時。白宮宣布，杜魯門總統將於特別國會審査援外及物價問題時，出席參衆兩院聯席會議致辭。又在馬歡爾出席衆院外交委員會時，商務部長哈里曼出席參院外委會。哈里受爲十九人特別委員會之主席，該委員會於上週末要求以一百二十億至一百七十億美元，撥與馬歇爾計劃下，供援助歐洲以及防止第三次大戰之用，馬歇爾之出席，力促通過五億九千七百萬之美元，以便對法。義。奧三國作緊急援助，渠闡明此係最低數字。</p>
<p>（聯合社華盛頓十二日電）馬歇爾今在衆院外委會稱：國民政府「必須更進一步，然後吾人始能更進一步」。美國軍官約一千人，正在援助中國政府從事剿共戰事，美國並已允在台灣襄助巾國訓練新軍。「惟中國問題遠甚於軍事局勢，巾國對於美國及全世界關係重大。此種觀念並未减輕，一切癥結端在中國苟不能大有作爲，則何能爲力。南京方面須大有作爲，然後吾人在此始能更有所爲」。馬氏並答復衆議員周以德「在中國龐大之軍事預算核减之前，是否有補救之希望」一問稱：「此即癥結所在」。周氏問：「以美國人民之金錢援助中國，僅用於挖肉補瘡，而不及其根本弊病，是否合理」。馬氏以乾脆之語氣曰：「周以德先生，余雅不願於本委員會討論時轉而批評中國政府」。</p>
<p>外委會主席伊頓結束此　稱：「此一問題，言盡於此」。</p>

<p>馬萊與余盛孝本不相識，事實上係由却利邀其計議，駕車相接，囑其改裝向余介紹同坐車中，因而共同謀害，如非却利從中聯繫，則馬萊不識余盛孝，何致犯罪。據此可見被吿却利，實爲木案之主謀。檢察官論告畢，却利當庭答辯稱，很令我欲擊斃余盛孝，以竊取其金條，我儘可謊余至任何地點將其謀害，何必携馬同往，令其目睹兇行而於法院作證乎？我實完全無辜。至此檢察官復就其答辯加以駁語。</p>
<p>被吿律師辯護</p>
<p>未由被告律師起立聲辯，謂被告並無殺人罪嫌，共理由有：（A）却利任司機，雙手握駕駛盤，何能執槍擊余；（B）殺人手槍及血衣·血褲，均在馬萊處抄獲；（C）按諸事實，證人口供及常識判斷，却利事前並未知馬有殺余之意，不能認爲同謀，應請庭上依法判決却利無罪。陳述至此，已過四時，乃宣佈本案辯論終結，定期宣判。</p>

<h3>張春帆對付冷山　訴狀已遞地檢處　略誘妨害自由列舉罪狀六點</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國泰越劇院經理張春帆，因筱丹桂自殺後，被地檢處以敎唆自殺罪起訴，刻仍在思南路看守所覊押中，近張延律師向地檢處控吿該案關係人冷山「略誘婦女，妨害自由」，訴狀昨已遞呈，文長千餘言，列舉冷山罪狀六點。原狀略謂：「竊查最近哄動全市之自殺越劇女伶筱丹桂（原名錢春韻以下統稱錢氏），為吿訴人之妾，以永久共同生活爲目的而同居一家，已達七年之久，依民法第一一二三條第三項所規定，錢氏爲吿訴人家屬之一員，按錢氏爲越劇藝人，名譟於時，貌旣美艷，私蓄尤豐，曩在吿訴人所設之國泰越劇院演出時名列主角（俗稱台柱），自越劇改進以後，舊劇本不合新潮流，始有編演新劇之趨向，僱用本案被吿爲編導之職，豈料該被吿涎錢氏之色，圖錢氏之富，藉其職務上之便利，不惜以種種手腕行使略誘，致錢氏選於無法自全，而馴至服毒自殺。</p>
<p>後台守候自行泡扶</p>
<p>被吿於本年四月間，與吳深（亦導演之一）聯合導演之「秦淮月」一劇，由錢氏任該劇主角，有躍入秦淮河自殺塲面，爲求逼眞計，須自三尺多高之距離躍下後台，而於躍下時每次均由被吿在後台守候，屛除他人，自行抱扶，共有七十餘塲之多，是該被吿以此爲勾引錢氏之初步計劃，情節顯然。</p>
<p>借用信箱互通情書</p>
<p>該被告於初步略誘計劃成功後，乃設法借用劉瓊（電影演員）信箱，與錢氏互通情書，果如被告所云「我與他所談皆是演劇上面的」一語，而爲眞實，則何等冠冕堂皇，儘可公開投送，何必鬼鬼祟祟，借用他人信箱，更何以於警局詢問之時，又諉稱早已遺失？</p>
<p>唆使離異意料中事</p>
<p>再査被吿在自白書中稱：「我每次打電話給筱都是下午二時左右，因爲筱以前約定的，那時張春帆不在家，所以我打電話給筱都是筱接的」。被吿與錢氏苟無曖昧略誘，互通電話，固極平常，何以必待吿訴人不在家，始與錢氏以電話相通。　被吿之略誘計劃旣已成就後，即以情書爲要挾，脅使錢氏失身與彼，固爲意中之事，而進一步計劃乃唆使錢氏脫離告訴人，更屬預料之中。</p>
<p>舉家遷避情虛畏罪</p>
<p>十月七日錢氏應被吿之約夜問出遊，據該被造所承認者，為因電影時間過早，而坐汽車至兆豐花園，又遊園時間憶過，門已關閉，故二人步行返回云云。惟按此日錢氏返家已在深夜十一時，以八時部在馬路中行走，其誰可信。　十月七日事經吿訴人發覺後，雖一度査究，但事後吿訴人與錢氏已言歸於好，不意十月十三日下午三時左右，錢氏與沈益濤在隣居魏美英室內密談十分鐘後，忽於是日下午五時在魏美英室內背人服毒身死，而問其言又有「作人難，難作人，死了」八字，究屬何事，是否沈益濤係受被吿之囑託，命錢氏表明態度，至堪疑問。而錢氏死後，被吿舉家遷避，情虛畏罪，不容狡賴。綜上各點所述，是該被吿觸犯刑法第二百九十八條第一二兩項之妨害自由罪，無可避免，爰依型事訴訟第二百十三條第四項規定，提起吿訴」。</p>

<h3>開棺騐白骨　無錫惠農橋屍塲　取出頭顱頸骨運滬續騐　「殺人魔王」王高生釘繚收禁</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫十一日訊〕殺人魔王王高生，係江陰塘南村人，原名任高生，綽號阿高頭，前在忠救軍第十支隊任中隊長，後隨陳肖平變節投僞，駐防本邑　橋鎭周　一帶，憑其職務上之勢力，綁架勒索，無所不爲。並於三十四年問，殺害鄕民徐阿玉，任阿七，徐吳氏，吉孫氏等四人。勝利後，經被害人家屬在途撞見，扭交警局，轉解地院，判處無期徒刑，旋王犯奉判不服，上訴高院，嗣高院核判時，認爲該案初判，對被殺鄉民，並未依法相驗，即依殺人罪科刑，於法無據。故於上月底，將該案原判決撤銷，</p>
<p>發還更審</p>
<p>。本月九日，由承辦推事趙昌年，再傳被害人家屬到庭審訊，諭令將屍棺運城待驗。十日傍晚，屍屬方面，當將吉孫氏，徐吳氏，徐阿玉，棺柩三具，由鄕運城，停泊於惠農橋西鐵路橋河畔，惟任阿七之屍體，當時因被肉身埋　於泥潭內，難以運城。十一日上午八時，由趙推事偕同宗檢驗員，前往鐵路橋屍塲，因該處地面狹小，移至錫澄路一號橋福林寺後背荒塲檢緻，常命土工將</p>
<p>三具棺柩</p>
<p>抬至岸上，揭開棺蓋，依法相驗，一時觀者人山人海，擠得水洩不通，惟棺內屍體，均成一付白骨，旋趙推事在屍塲擺設臨時公案，傳訊屍屬吉榮根（吉孫氏之姪），吉徐氏（徐阿玉徐吳氏夫婦之家屬）被害經過，據稱：吉孫氏生前年五十八歲，在三十四年五月間，被王高生先以利刃</p>
<p>砍去左耳</p>
<p>然後開槍擊斃，徐阿玉，徐吳氏為夫婦，於三十三年七月十九日，被王高生綁架出外，用繩勒斃，當時因懼其淫威，未及更衣，草草棺殮，並稱徐吳氏年僅二十有一，生前姿色秀麗，王犯强納爲妻未遂，而動殺機，禍及其夫徐阿玉等語，嗣即開始相驗，苜驗吉孫氏骨殖，檢得左耳頭　骨有刀傷一處，頭　骨已碎，確係生前刀傷致死。次驗徐吳氏發現頸骨問有皮綫一條，依然環繞頸項骨七節，第五四兩節有傷痕，頭頂骨有血印一處，左脚腕骨有繩痕，兩手有</p>
<p>草繩反縛</p>
<p>痕，結果將頭　及頸項骨七　，併取出，最後檢驗徐阿玉屍骨，驗得頸項間亦有草繩環繞，兩手有繩索反縛痕。檢驗良久，因未發現傷骨，即將頭顧及頸骨取出，一併帶院，待送往上海法醫檢驗所檢驗後，再行核辦。骷骨仍由屍屬收殮，運鄕埋葬，聞殺人犯王高生，仍怙惡不悛，在獄中收徒，且為「龍頭」。上月間曾一度鬧監，並串同其餘人犯，挖掘壁洞，企圖脫逃，幸發覺尙早，當將該犯釘錄收禁。</p>

<h3>兩客軍聯袂抵滬　馬來足球隊十六日首戰靑白莆田田徑隊十八日開始對抗</h3>
<p>馬來亞華僑組織之暹邏香港上海菲列濱遠征軍聯華足球隊，於本月初由新加坡啓程，先後在曼谷香港等地比賽，攻無不克，戰無不利，成績彪炳，該隊在港戰程完畢後，昨日上午十時搭乘專機由港起飛，於下午二時三十分抵達本市龍華機塲，客軍一行下機後，即由華僑團體之丁如玉小姐向領隊獻花，客軍領隊郭昌福含笑接受，該隊除隊員陳家壽因在曼谷比賽受傷，已專程返歸新嘉坡外，一行共廿三人，星島足球會胡好亦同機來滬，客軍一律穿藏靑色西裝制服，色調鮮明，精神飽滿，旋與歡迎者在機塲合聶一影多，即搭足委會所備大客車，直馳百樂門飯店休息。</p>
<p>足球委員會對客軍征滬戰程，原已排定，惟客軍昨抵滬後，略有更動，同時招待組方面對華聯隊招待之日程亦經排定，預定自本週六開始第一塲比賽，至二十五日結束返港，留滬約二週，中間並擬於十七日機飛首都，向最高當局致敬，二十日遊覽杭州，全部程序探誌於後：</p>

<h3>大夏大同兩大學　學生反對罷課</h3>
<p>〔大光社訊〕十一日下午八時，大夏大學經濟學會與史社學會學生戴力陳贊培等數人，自稱代表，召集一部份同學開會，提議爲後援浙大自殺學生于子三，即日開始罷課，乃到場大多數同學，以此事顯有奸匪份子陰謀操縱，羣起反對。戴等見所謀未遂，即遷怒於史社系四年級學生王國珍，上前拳足交加，王生從此即吿失踪，迄今尙無下落，大夏全體同學均感極度憤慨，頃已成立後援會，準備一面找尋王同學下落，一面　請當局懲治兇手，剷除奸匪，陰謀餘孽。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕昨晨九時，大同大學忽來不明身份靑年八九人，到處張貼標語，並與各班同學接觸，煽動罷課，乃多數同學感於上期罷課受匪徒利用，貽害能淺，深自警惕，發覺來人言語學動，又係奸徒一貫技倆，於是羣起將該暴徒等轟出校門，撕毀各種標語傳單，仍照常上課云。</p>
<h3>約大敎育系學生籌愛羣義校基金</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕聖約翰大學敎育系學生創辦之「愛羣義校」，頃發起基金勸募運動，目標定爲五千萬元，已獲校方贊同。該校自去秋創辦以來，成績斐然，現有學生二百餘人，太半係附近無力負擔學費之商店學徒，失業兒童，工人等，均予免費就讀。該校前募之五百萬元基金，已吿用罄，乃決定再度發起勸募基金運動，俾此社會敎育，得以繼續發展·｜</p>
<h3>市運會側寫　秋風颯颯寒意加深黃沙滾滾鬚眉盡黑</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕大會第二日，秋風忽然轉勁，黃昏時分，寒意更深，運動員們大都科頭跣足，致冷得戰戰兢兢。觀衆亦紛紛却步，一時偃旗息鼓，八門冷落，在蔽日黃沙巾，大會職員鬚眉盡黑，滿面風塵。</p>
<p>昨日下午一時，司令台前倐地捲起一陣狂颷，疾而且厲，結果揚聲器架被吹倒地，幸喇叭並未跌壊，依舊能够號令三軍。</p>
<p>醫護人員昨天頗不寂寞，有六個運動員會受急救，其中三個是因爲運動過劇昏倒，其餘三個則因爲天氣太冷，神經冰厥。</p>
<p>刮目相看</p>
<p>在這裹就更顯得新生小學（即漕河涇兒童敎養所）學生們的可佩了，每人白汗衫一件，三角褲一條，在寒風中表演「飛機操」，千變萬化，不疾不徐。道些當年流浪在街頭的孩子們，誰知道他們在體格上，紀律上會有今日的成就？</p>
<p>昨日午後會塲中有一小學生査震元，在學校全體返校時，離隊迷途，號哭不已，後來由第四區斜橋國民學校的童子軍詢明，將其車送回家。日行一善，見義勇爲，年靑人畢竟還是可愛的。</p>
<p>古色古香</p>
<p>團體操表演比較精彩的是頤生小學的織錦舞，匠心獨具，美觀而又別緻。培本的農作舞，男女兩隊，一律赤足穿草鞋，男的戴草笠，女的紮頭巾，有小提琴與鑼鼓伴奏，音響動作，均臻自然，爲昨天大會中最富古典氣氛的表演。</p>
<p>司令台上的擴音機是大會中最忠實而又最忙的工作者，尋人，招領，發令，以至打招呼，幾乎沒有一分鐘間斷過。有一次一個學生穿越跑道，不守規則，擴聲機內忽然怒斥一聲「混蛋！」全塲震驚。有時候節目稍爲空閑，擴聲機無事可做，遂隱約傳來一陣嘻笑　浪的聲音，使塲外觀衆神往不置。</p>
<p>易幟之夕</p>
<p>小學運動會昨天已經全部結束，今天大專，中學，以及公開組將正式開塲，預料會塲中載歌載舞的塲面不會再有，代之出現的一定是緊張熱烈的角逐與競爭。</p>
<p>昨晚暮色蒼茫中，塲地人影　　，一邊是各小學拔營奏凱，一淡是大中學立寨安營。蚱蜢式的蓬帳逐漸减少，蒙古包式的，七星帳式的蓬帳代之以興，故昨晚可稱「易幟之夕」。</p>
<p>田賽部份的裁判員稱「預賽」爲「疲勞點名」，因爲預賽中每一項目都有近二百以上的運動員，試擲，試跳，第一次……單單點名，就够口乾舌燥，聲嘶力竭了。</p>

<h3>經委會草擬具體計劃　協助出輸出口物資產銷如能發展　輸入限額自可放寬</h3>
<p>政府以出口物資，爲外匯之泉源，素極重視。過去以種種關係，出口物資之輸出，未能順利進行，雖在外匯政策之協助下，但目前優回，仍未打開。出口業之艱困，未克解除。今日各方均重視輸入之限額問題，而不知增加輸出，以謀補救。　現政府常局認爲今日之　出，重於輸入，如輸出有辦法，輸入限額自可放寬。頃悉：全國經濟委員會。對於出口物炎，已着手草擬輸出具體計劃，關於出口物資之生產成本，運輸，及其標準等問題，特別予以重視。至於資金之運用，技術之改良，原料之供應，運輸之暢通等項，決設法予以協助，輸管會輸出推廣處，已提供各種資料，預料短期內，此項計劃，即可公布。對於出口物資，將有新發展。</p>
<h3>人心向榮客帮爭購棉紗布一致上升四二支藍鳳紗高漲近二百萬</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因華北各地市價堅昂，客帮採辦甚暢，本街複製品廠商，恐政府統收後，對統配手續延擱，原料將發生影響，故均先事搜吸，行情冉冉上升。結果四十二支藍鳳細紗，比假前步漲一百九十萬，爲三千八百十萬元。其他各支粗細紗，亦均續升五六十萬至百萬左右。</p>
<p>棉布市况，晨開尙平，嗣聞天津·漢口等地價昂，客帮辦胃奇暢，本街同業以紗市激昂，人心向榮，塲內貝氣驟濃，染織廠對中檔細布，頻加收吸，業外拉提亦勁，故最後十二磅龍頭等各檔細布行情，比假前狂升的萬五千至五六萬元。四君子及金蓮妙舞嗶嘰，客帮暢進，價昂六萬五千至四萬元，其餘谷布價亦堅挺。</p>
<p>現棉緊俏</p>
<p>昨現棉日市况疾進，小型紗廠扒吸甚烈，同業跟進，價格冉冉上漲，午後以棉紗收盤猛晋，貨主扳俏，置戶需求頗殷，脚地堅挺，交易甚旺，各檔成交一七○〇包又七百祖。送廠價故開靈寳三九七萬，德字棉四二九萬，四一二四萬，漢細三七二萬七百担。棧交價做開1比32特林四〇五萬，靈寳四一四萬，彰德三九二萬七千，漢細三七二萬，啓東三四四萬，成交八五〇包，周浦籽花四萬。</p>
<h3>複製業公會要求　參加棉紗聯配</h3>
<p>本市複製業等九公會，暨外埠常熟·江陰·無錫·吳縣·常州，等五縣複製工業公會，頃以聯合配紗，政府組織配紗委員會主持其事。複製業曾要求推派代表，共同參加，然未得紡綢會許可。各該業鑒於聯合配紗，目的在求得產銷雙方供需平衡。複製業爲棉紗實銷唯一去路，如不能獲得代表參加，則配銷實施以後，仍多隔閡，關係同業利害至鉅，特再聯名電請行政院經濟部全經會等，向各有關機關呼籲。茲節錄其理由如次：</p>
<p>棉紡廠所產之紗，實銷對象爲複製業，故聯合配紗，必須根據複製生產之設備產量，作定時定量之分配，然後物資供需，得趨於正軌。且調節技術，亦須公開，故其主持機構，應由複製業共同參加。</p>
<p>配紗議價，更須合理。產者同須顧及生產成本，而用者則舍配紗以外，更無其他正規供應之門。但過去議價，向由紡綢會授權議價小組會，議價小組因黑市一高，議價提高。似此議價，足以刺激人心，今後應由複製工業參加審議。</p>
<p>前紡管會主持配銷時，對於重要設施之決定，每召集複製代表出席參加會議，提供意見。今聯合配銷將澈底加强穩定物價，則供需雙方，自應取得協調。</p>
<h3>呢羢買賣又盛</h3>
<p>呢羢市面，平疲已有半月，交易減弱，昨茶會上及棋盤街大批發戶，買賣又趨繁盛，應市及時之深色花呢，中厚嗶嘰，大衣呢，麥而登平厚呢，馬褲呢，駝斯錦，長毛羢女色呢，以及法西襯黑炭襯，袖裏洋布，絲光羽紗等類，成交均夥。本街客帮咸有添辦，零躉生意復轉熱鬧，標準行情，因此悉多由疲轉穩。</p>
<h3>食米去化呆滯　粳秈均見下挫</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬八千餘石，去化呆滯，內地雖然挺站，奈因申方南路蘇嘉綫到貨奇旺，市况一瀉千里，早薄稻猛跌四五萬元，黎里松江南粳狂落五六萬元，北粳隨之續挫三萬元，　米亦代小而萬元，白陰元跟跌</p>
<p>麵粉因米價大跌，人心虛軟，暴跌萬元，麩皮執貨者雖堅，但實銷平淡，軋跌二三千元。豆餅則汕頭　動。廠方軋現，依然挺立。黃豆客幫仍然動辦，惟各物下降，隨之低落萬元。杜豆來貨頗　，仍難起色，　削萬元，蠶豆疲莫能興，修削三五千元。赤豆外埠不動，本街　落，續短三五千元。</p>
<p>荼豆南洋揀高略動，高貨暫平，中次胃呆不振，下挫一二萬元。豇豆汕頭續取，高定次呆，中下回跌萬元。紅　亦然步跌萬元，苞米北洋仍　，再跌一二萬元。芝蔴參差不一，黑蘇油頭搜羅甚力，步挺萬元，白蘇洋莊沉悶，本街仍淡，續疲一二萬元，奶蔴供求兩稀，形勢少神。生仁廣帮暢吸，暫成平定之格。</p>
<p>油市供多於求，劇烈下跌，生油呆木之極，狂落十萬元，榮油相繼下挫物五六萬元。豆油貨滽，猛降四五萬元，淸油亦跌三五萬元，蔴油隨之下降三五萬元，小麥廠方乏交。</p>
<h3>國行稽核處發表九月行莊存款額</h3>
<p>國行　核處昨日（十三）發表九月份全國各行莊存欵及準備金總額比較表如次，活期存款二，四七一，七八九，八三九，二〇六·六六元，定期存款三六七，一〇八，二九〇，五〇六·二六元，存款總額二，八三八，八九一，一二九，七一二·九二元，一已繳準備金三九一，一九一，二一四五，三三三·五五元</p>
<h3>國內外需求棉布甚殷中信現以棉紗易布</h3>
<p>（本報訊）中央信託局對於無證外棉舫成棉紗，現正積極辦理外銷各節，經迭誌本報，迄昨日（十二日）止，已訂約銷出棉紗共四千二百件，棉布二十六萬八千餘疋。茲悉：該局近應布廠之請求，將紗換布後輸出，其調換率約爲二十支四百磅裝紗一件，換十二磅細布二十九疋左右。凡本市布廠備有四十碼長，三十六吋寬合於外銷之十二磅細布一萬疋以上者，可於本月底以前與該購料處接洽調換。惟該項布疋係專供外銷之用。對於品質極爲重視不稍茍且。藉以維護國產信譽。又該局並有三十二支及四十二支　股細紗。已有一部份交換汗衫手帕及襯衫府綢等棉織品出口。現尙有餘額，凡具有棉織品出口經騐之廠方，亦可儘速與該局購料處接洽。</p>
<h3>華股買氣見旺永紗出三百關</h3>
<p>華股昨中途雖在紗花帮了結中見疲，但北路游資湧到，北帮振臂一呼，物資亦吿躍升，後市更得差出之助，臨收又吿如火如茶。</p>
<p>晨初　　以報載美貸款分期實施之說而見昂，永紗自二八八元及二九七元開後，升至即交二九二元，遞交三〇二元高價。旋有脫手現永紗及賣遞交，乃退至二八三元及二九二元。塲外息價開高少許，爲一角六分半及二角一。此後略有回升，但以力售現永紗了結即交者，十一時四十分，迫降至即交二七九元，遞交二八六元低價。午收仍被抬高至二八八元及二九六元結束。結果較封關前，即交股計永紗華新大通信誼微升，閘北統益美亞中絲火柴新光景綸永公景福新亞內衣華豐中法微降，勤興麗安中紡榮豐均平，遞交股計新光景福勤興微升，華豐尙平，永紗信和美亞漲半成。</p>
<p>後市　　上場即因物資蠢動而見穩，永紗升至即交二九八元，　交三〇六元。終以交換差出，並聞南京幫在塲外力購二億股之訓，人心一振，乃穿出三百元大關，達三〇五元及三一三元高價，而後以三〇四元及三一三元收市，結果較晨收即交股永紗華新信和新光華豐中法閘北各漲半成，麗安信誼平平，餘均微升，遞交股新光勤興微升，餘咸漲半成，塲外各老股公用股稍低，銀行股再升半成，餘尙平定。</p>
<p>又訉：現遞套利交易較上屆略昂，但銀行頭寸仍超過多頭，永紗自九元半退至八元二，美亞自十三元退至十二元，信和自五元降至四元，新光在一元光景，華豐約二元有零，貼進者自一角〇五至一角三分半，貼出者一角三分半至一角六分半。</p>
<p>直接稅局作函紀人公會，略云「印花稅爲憑證稅，與交易稅之性質不同，並無重複課稅之處，仍請轉飭各經紀人，按照印花稅法第十六條，第十目規定貼用印花稅票」云。</p>
<p>新華百貨增產完成，起恢復賣買，成交單位十萬股。</p>
<h3>統債略疲外股上升</h3>
<p>公債昨見不振，統丙晨開二二五〇〇元，高價二二八〇〇元，低價二〇六〇〇元，而後稍定。統丙較封關前跌二千七，餘債各降一千九，成交約五百萬。</p>

<h3>抗戰前後—上海電信局工務比較</h3>
<p>— 趙立</p>
<p>電信交通，瞬息萬里，不論戰時與平時，爲兵戰抑爲商戰之工具，其重要性未有甚於此者。上海爲全國政治經濟之中心，電工通訊，需與全國各地之大小城鎭相聯絡，其性能之重要工作之繁忙。可以想見。茲將上海電信局之工務在抗戰前後作一簡略之比較，諒亦爲關切電政諸君所樂聞乎。</p>
<p>（甲）市內電話</p>
<p>上海全市電話用戶，數量總計釣七萬戶。居全國各大城市之冠。然大部用戶，集中於舊租界區域，其在虹口及南市區域者，不及用戶總數十分之一而已，因創立時，上述二區域行政制度之劃分，故市內電話之管理及機械程式亦各不相同。前者爲美商上海電話公司所經營，機械屬旋轉式，後者爲我國交通部電信局所經營，機械屬步進式。雙方區域間之聯絡，則設中繼綫以構通之，抗戰初期，滬市淪陷，美商電話公司及常話局二機構，均被日敵强佔，前年秋，滬市光復，吾政府爲顧全盟邦利益對舊租界區域之市內電話，仍發還美商經營，至前電話局所轄閘北及南市之市內電話，則與電報業務合併，成立電信局總其事。</p>
<p>本市幅員遼闊，除市區電話外，郊區電話亦同時發展。以市區電話爲核心，形成一電話網，故目前上海電信局所轄之市內電話附屬機構通計有虹口南市浦東三電話交換所及市中心吳淞眞如龍華復興島各交換分所，所裝機城分為自動式共電式及磁石式三類，關於戰前戰後機械容量及程式，今列表比較如后：</p>
<p>關於市內電話在戰時被毀約計二千戶，戰後二年來，應社會之需要，力謀恢復，並加擴充，但限於建設經費通訊器材，及技術人才三者供感缺乏歇態下，若欲大規模擴充，顯非短時期所能實現，故目前對新用戶之增加，不得不加以限制也。</p>
<p>（乙）長途電話</p>
<p>長途電話分有綫無綫二種，工程設備雖有不同，但通話效率則無分軒輊。在距離較短者，立桿架錢需費不鉅，故通話大都採用有綫。在距離較遠者，以無綫電終端機代替立桿架綫，對物資及維持上，均稱經濟合宜，故通話以無錢較爲相宜，我國戰前長途電話事業係初創時期，設備簡陋，上海電話局之長途通話機械設備，僅交換台六席，記錄台二席，及單路載波電話終端機二具而已，戰後滬市各電話用戶需要長途電話非常殷切，可由通話繁忙情形中見其大槪，故機綫設備二年來逐漸增加以應需要；茲將長途有綫電話及無綫電話工程設備分述如下：</p>
<p>一，有綫電話－現有長途交換台十八席，長途記錄台六席，戲波電話電路三十三，銅活綫路十二路，鐵話綫路十二路。工作不分晝夜，實行二十四小時通話制以利用戶，至長途話綫綫路之分佈，則以上海爲核心，其分支情形可分爲三：（A）近距　系電話網－上海近距離在一百公里以內各城鎭區械，計有四，五公厘經鐵話綫十二對，聯成一電話網，通達嘉定太倉松江靑浦寳山川沙閔行等地，（B)南支系電話網－由上海向南達嘉興杭州　縣等地因距離長，通話衰耗亦多，故架設銅話綫以代鐵話綫，又以通話繁忙，實綫不數支配，乃增加載波設備以完成通話之使命，目前設備計有二，九公厘經銅話綫三對，載波電話電路八路，（C）西支系電話網－由上海向西經崑山蘇州無錫常州鎭江而遼南京，計架設銅話綫三。五公厘經者二對，二，九公厘經者八對，又各局均設有載波機以暢通話，目前共有載波電話電路計廿五路。</p>
<p>二、無綫電話－無綫電話設備，可分爲下列三類：（A）國內通話用短波發話機三座，分裝於眞如南翔建國西路三發信台，裝於偵如者，爲一　機，通達重慶北平天津漢口四處，裝於南翔及建國西路者，均爲六瓸機，通達濟南靑島廣州台北四處，至收話機三具，則裝於劉行收信台，另有終端機三具，皆裝於續浜橋本局大廈內。（B）近距難通話用超短波五十瓦收發話機二座，裝於橫　橋本局，分別與南京及鄞縣通話，該機波長四米達，通話距離約自廿五至五十英里，如通話距離超過上述距離時，則設中繼站以輔助之，故上海南京間，在崑山無錫奔牛鎭江設有中繼站四處，上海鄞縣間，在張　設有中繼站一處，以完成通話之使命，（C）國際通話用二瓩機雙路單邊帶無綫電話機一座，該機可供二對用戶同時通話，其達話機設於眞如，收話機設於劉行，終端機設於橫浜橋與長途台毗鄰，俾便轉接，終端機上裝有保密設備（Split　Band　Priacy　System）將用戶所發之話音週率切成數段，每段再以不同之週率，加以調頻，而該調頻週率，每隔二十秒鐘樊換一次，故非用相同之終端機加以還原，用戶之談話不能爲他人收聽，較從前標準以三千週反音保密優良多多，實爲現代最新式最經濟之無綫電話機件，現與舊金山通話，經爲通暢優良。</p>
<p>（丙）有錢電報及無綫電報</p>
<p>戰前電報設備，有綫者較無錢爲發達，蓋有綫電報歷史悠久，在應用上雖不若無綫電之方便而經濟，但在我國經濟窮困狀態下，將原有之有綫設備棄置不用而改用新式無錢設備，當爲經濟能力所不許及戰後重新建設則環境又各不同。以同等之金錢採購有効而輕便之無綫電收發報機自較採購落伍之有錢報機爲相宜，故目前有綫報房對戰時已損壞或已陳舊之機件概置不用，而代以最新式之打字電報機。若以報機數量比較，戰前多於戰後，但以性能効率而言，則戰後固較戰前爲優也，至於無綫設備之比較，則數量及電力二項，戰後均較戰前爲强。茲列表分別比較如下：</p>
<p>（丁）最近之發展</p>
<p>目前電話電報設備仍感不數應用，尤以市內電話爲甚。若非大量擴充，不足以適應各界之要求。但値茲戡亂建國時期，經費極度支細，申請外匯尤屬困難，故工程設備，亦祗能逐漸擴展，最近在進行及計劃中者，有下列各項：（A）虹口交換所增加自動總機五百號，國內長途台九席，國際技途台十四座席。（B）虹口及南市交換所通上海電話公司中繼電纜分別加設一百及二百對鎧裝電纔各一條（C）新建七寳收信台集中收訊機統一管理。（D）擴充南翔發信台，加裝二班發報機二具，並添建報機房。（E）裝置電傳總收報處及自動送報設備。（F）增加電傳打字電報機。（G）加設中央室至各電台遙控綫電纜，（H）各發訊機之四式眞空管改爲美式眞空管，（I）上海天津間無線電試用電傳打字機直結收發。</p>

<h3>電信常識講話　第三講怎樣採用特別業務</h3>
<p>— 張家鈺</p>
<p>一，校對（標識TC）一般說來，隨着電信機械的逐漸改進，傳遞錯誤的可能性已經减至極小限度；但另一方面，由於中國方塊字的結構過於複雜，中國電信事業雖已經過六十多年的演化，可是截至目前爲止，所有佔全部來去電報百分之九十以上的華文電報，仍然不得不襲用四碼電碼譯發，因此，電文裏偶有一碼譯錯或拍錯，就不免失之毫　，差以千里，例如「十」牛的電碼是「0577」而「千」字的電碼却是「0578」。先前一輩資歷較深的報務員對於譯電非常熟悉，縱有錯誤，不難立即査明更正，但近年電信學識日新月異，從業人員所必須學習的智識技能非常廣泛，除專司譯電的譯電人員外，一般報務員對於譯電一門，已經不容許化費太多的功夫去强記，同時，現代各種高速度自動收發報機傳遞電報的速率，較人工機高出不祗十倍，在傳遞過程中，已無法逐字細讀，由此種種，電報在傳遞上所發生的錯誤，事宣上仍難絕對避免。電局針對上述缺點，近來已恢復來報譯送辦法，電文裹如有極顯明的錯誤，已能在譯送前隨即查明更正，但對於華洋文密語電文以及明語電文內寫在括弧裏的阿拉伯字，即使發生錯誤也不容易看得出來。所以，爲欲增進電報準確，可在電首加寫「校對」兩字（或TC標識），收報電局對於冠有這種標識的電報，應在抄收完畢後向發報電局拍回一次，以便與原底核對。</p>
<p>工商界對於報道市場行情的電報，最好多多採用校對辦法，舉一個例子，現有一設立在天津的某紗號擬託上海紗布交易所的某經紀人代爲買進棉紗，事先曾經發出電報，通知此經紀人在四十二支藍鳳牌棉紗跌到每包二千五百萬元時代爲買進十包，但這張電報在傳遞時偶一不愼，把二千五百萬誤傳爲二千六百萬，以致此經紀人在跌至每包二千六百萬元時就已代爲買進，但不久市價就接續跌至每包二千五百萬元甚至二千五百萬元以下，直等到經紀人和委託人之間結帳時，纔發覺因常報拍錯，以致蒙受意外損失，而電局方面，除照章退回報費外不負其他賠償責任。如果發報人在發電時採用校對辦法，就不致發生這種岔子。</p>
<p>話雖這樣說法，電局收發電報，現已亟盡一切努力，務求準確無誤，凡電文內寫在括弧裏的各種重要數字，都已規定複拍一次，以便校對。但爲發報人着想，採用校對特別業務應付的費用僅照尋常電報價加半收取，（假定尋常電報費爲每字一千元，則無論原電係特快。加急或尋常電報，其加收的校對費應爲每字五百元），所費不多而對於增進電報準確性，收效極大，眞是何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<p>二，預付回電費若千元（標識RP……）　採用預付回電費特別業務的電報，相當於附有回信郵票的信件，假定現有住在漢口的某田準備委託住在上海的某乙打聽上海市塲上某種貨品的市價，並希望某乙用電報答覆，但某甲與某乙之間，平日向少經濟來往，而拍發電報的報費，照章必須由發報人納付，某甲爲不願使某乙爲他負担拍發回電的報費，可在拍發電報時在報首寫明「預付回電費若千元」或「RP……（元）」標識，並將某乙自上海拍回漢口的回電的報費約數連同本身發給上海某乙電報的報費，一併付給漢口電局。</p>
<p>上海電局在接到自漢口發來的那張冠有「預付回報費若干元」的標識的電報後，立即開發一載明價値的預付回報費憑單，封在電報裏一併送給某乙，某乙於收到這張憑單之日起三個月內，持憑向電局拍發與單面所開價値同價的電報一份，不另收費。但回電報費如果超過預付回電費的數目，所有超出之數，應由某乙照付；回電報費如果低於預付回電費之數目，低餘之數，一經某甲（發報人）或某乙（收報人）之請求，仍由漢口電局退還某（甲）原發報人）。又某乙持憑單拍發回電，幷不限定必須發給繳付預付回電費的原發報人，換句話說：某乙亦可利用某甲所付之預付回電費，柏發電報致與住在國內任何可通電報地方的任何人。</p>
<p>某乙收到某甲所發的附有預付回電費的電報後，如果因爲交情關係，不願收受某甲的預付回電費血自願付費拍發回電或根本不願接受某甲的委託時，可於收到後之三個月內將此預付回電費憑單退回電局，幷要求通知原發報局把此項付回電費全數退還某甲</p>
<h3>新興業務介紹　什麽是夜信電報</h3>
<p>— 陶庸</p>
<p>夜信電的由來「夜信電報」原是書信電報的一種，便利拍發電文較長的電報。在歐美開辦一已久，國內雖然早有人倡議過，但終以不夠成本，辦理困難，遲遲未能實現，最近電信總局正在積極推進業務，毅然不顧一切設備上，經濟上，人事上的種種困難，開放夜信電，便利民衆，這是值得介紹的。</p>
<p>特點和優點夜信電報正和夜間减價通話同樣性質；因爲白天電信局的業務繁忙，利用夜間較淸　的機會來遲送，換句話會所，它要放在尋常電報以後傳送。但它的價格要比尋常電便宜一半。爲了節省經濟，一張較多字數的電報可發夜信電。</p>
<p>投送時間　依照規定，如果收報局在日間收到的，應在當日晚間（下午七時以後）投送；如時）送達收報局的，隨時投送；</p>
<p>計費與字數夜信電祇能限用華文或英文明語，每電至少以廿五字起算，即不過廿五字者，亦作廿五字計費，過此按字　加計費，華文夜信電每字五百元，英文每字一千元，等於尋常電的一半　譯電費仍照普通價目，每字一百元。</p>
<p>納費標識這種電報應於電首（即收報任姓名住址之前）書明「夜信」或英文「NLIT」作爲納費標識，均按一字計費。</p>
<p>適用特別業務夜信電還可以適用「預付回報費」「分送」「送妥通知」等特別業務，但「預付回報費」華文不得低於一萬二千五百元，英文不得低於二萬五千元。「分抄費」照尋常電分抄收費。「送妥通知」按夜信電　目加收十二字之報費（即華文加收六千元，英文加收一萬二千元）。「送妥函知」加收掛號信之郵費。</p>
<p>怎樣利用它我們發一張電報，如果字數過多，非常不經濟，而這張電報又沒有什麽火急的事情，不妨利用夜信電，再就時間上講，如果拍發的時間在下午或晚上，那利用夜信電並不慢，而費用較尋常電可省下一半，何緊而不爲呢？</p>
<p>開放地點　南京，上海，北平，天津，武漢，重慶，西安，蘭州，迪化，成都，昆明，貴陽，桂林，長沙，廣州，福州，杭州，南昌，洛陽，青島，鄭州　陽，長春，台北，開封，無錫鎭江，吳縣，永嘉，　嶺，徐州，蕪湖，合肥，　嶺，宜昌，衡陽，九江，吉安，萬縣，宜賓，　縣，合川，內江，廣元，韶關，汕頭，厦門，唐山，西峯寗　等五十地。</p>

<h3>紅葉</h3>
<p>— 王百里</p>
<p>老殘遊記「一路秋山紅葉，老　黃花」，現在正是道個時　了。參觀復興公國的菊展以後，不免速帶的想起紅葉來。</p>
<p>査「紅葉」二字述用者，當以一紅葉題詩」爲最早，靑瑣高議云：「唐傳宗時，于佑於御溝中拾一葉，上有詩，佑亦題詩於棄，置溝上流，（能否上流，姑妄　之）富人韓夫人拾之，後値帝放宮女，韓氏嫁佑成禮，各於　中取紅葉相示曰：「可謝媒矣」。韓氏有「方知紅葉是良媒」句。又雲溪友議，宣宗朝已有題紅葉隨流故事，同見辭源「紅葉題詩」條，按僖宗爲宣衆之孫，（宣宗傳子　宗　宗傳子　宗）即此事已平在宣宗之時，但當時因無詩句流傳，故事不甚　。總之，「紅葉」二字，其源皆導於杜牧之「箱葉紅於二月花」的詩句，牧之山行詩云：「遠上寒山石徑斜，白雲深處有人家；停車坐愛楓林曉，霜葉紅於二月花」。其後「紅葉」之見於吟詠　，即　見不鮮。但詠「紅葉」之最耐人忍味者，莫如淸時的崔瘦生，崔有「如夢令」一詞云：「爲愛吳江晚景，渡口斜陽相映；點水似桃花，無數遊魚錯認。風定，風定，一樣落紅堆徑」。</p>

<h3>鑾披汶與暹羅</h3>
<p>— 征凡</p>
<p>暹羅九日發生政變，由鑾披汶領導的叛軍，刹那間控制了暹羅政府，隨即修改憲拿，改組內閣，並沒有流血，就完全達到了奪取政權的目的。</p>
<p>不管這個新政府能够維持到多久，但是有一個事實很顯明，鑾披汶又紅起來了。他雖然自知不洽國際與情，在新內閣中沒有參加實際政務，但隱然他是掌握了整個暹羅的幕後大權的。</p>
<p>策動這次政變的　披汶究竟是怎樣的一個人呢？</p>
<p>我們不應該健忘！暹羅在這次大戰中的作風，猶如歐洲的匈牙利，它參加了「大東亞共榮圈」，並且不自量力地向盟國宣過戰。當時的暹羅首相，（到日本去覲見東條的那副嘴臉，猶在目前，）便是今日的鑾披汶元帥。</p>
<p>我們也不會忘記：十多年來，僑居過羅的三百萬中國同胞，受盡了無數殘酷的歧視，辱待，甚至屠殺。主持並執行這些排華政策的首腦，也正是這位鑾披汶元帥。</p>
<p>這樣看，這政變後的暹羅新政府，其本質也不難想見了。今後過羅的動向，誠然値得我們注目。</p>
<p>以武力叛變奪取政機，原是鑾披汶的拿手好戲。一九三二年有名的逞羅政變是他的第一砲，鑾披汝所領導的「暹羅軍人實力派」，把君主和貴族統治的暹羅，算是「革」了一下「命」，他自己却掌握了大政變的收穫，勾結着一部份封建勢力，來鞏固他的統治；一面向華僑的工商企業，用最露骨的手段來掠奪和摧殘。</p>
<p>這樣，他把七世皇趕了出去，拖來了一個十來歲的小娃娃，尊之曰八世皇。這位八世皇一向住在瑞士，遏羅的事情連聽也沒有聽到過，即使聽到了，十來歲的核子也難以過問，一切國家要政，少不了委託鑾披汶來代勞。於是，經過了一番不名譽的「內不　淸」，鑾披汶便以國務總理而兼理內政，外交，軍事等七項要職。他製造的傀儡戲，就此全功吿成。</p>
<p>鑾披汶的性格，可以拿「狂悖」「頑强」和「好勝」三字包括。他出身德國軍校，極端崇拜德國國社黨的作風，因此他執業政機後最得意的傑作，便是所謂「唯國主義」，亦即所謂大泰族主義。顯然地，這是從德國的大日耳曼主義學得來的，其實際內容，即包括獨裁主義，軍國主義，排外主義（實際上無他可排，僅是排華，）也即是希特勒式的蠻幹瞎撞的瘋狂主義而已。</p>
<p>他的政策，是親日排華。他想以他的「友邦」日本作護身符，來威脅安南及英美，他方面又想以保持中立來要挾日本，希望在混水裏摸魚。他夢想控制安南，更以大泰族爲名，想把暹羅的北界伸展到我國的揚子江。他一意孤行他的夢想，不惜卑躬屈膝，百般討好日本。太平洋戰事爆發後，暹羅儼然身價十倍，鑾披汝自然也得意非凡，終於做了「友邦」日本的附庸，居然爲了「建設大東亞」而向英美宣起戰來。不幸，鑾披汶的如意算盤沒有打成，日本投降了，鑾披汶的好夢也完了，而且以「暹奸」身份曾被看押了若干時候。</p>
<p>暹羅自然也不乏愛好民主和平的人士，雖然在鑾披汶的獨裁政制下，也時常展開着反獨裁的浪潮，因此　披汶在一九三五年就受過兩顆槍彈，沒有死，隨即五十個軍官就被他處了死刑；一九三八年又遭到第二次謀殺，在夜飯中預置了毒藥，又沒有死，十七個官員又立即被他監禁起來。關於鑾披汶對付政敵的毒辣手段，在國際上早已是「如雷贯耳」的。</p>
<p>再說一些　披汝對付華僑的「德政」吧！在「唯國主義」之下，僑胞的痛苦是難以磬述的，華僑的產業，隨時可能被「收歸國有」，華僑學校唸祖國的文字都遭到無理的限制。鑾披汶時常授意部下在華僑集中區縱火焚掠；華僑的報紙除了替　披汝作傳聲筒外，根本不敢說話，新聞記者隨時有被暗殺的危險，　光炎先生便是其中一個。</p>

<h3>兩個恐怖的島嶼</h3>
<p>— 破輪</p>
<p>世界上有兩個恐怖的島嶼，簡直就是人世間的活地獄；因爲這兩個島嶼都是用來監禁囚犯的。一個在法國，呌做魔鬼島；另一個在台灣的，呌做火燒島。</p>
<p>魔鬼鳥是法國著名的監禁囚犯的地方，是在一八五二年成立，已經有一百年的歷史了。這個島的四週有兇惡的鯊魚，危險的浮沙和野獸，差不多沒有人類的踪跡；所以囚犯沒有辦法逃出來，這些犯人所過的生活，好像魔鬼一樣。因之送到那裏的犯人只有十分之一活到五年，統計這個島囚禁過七萬以上犯人，犯人都要工作，以耕種度日；工作是有代價的，每天兩法郞，月尾且可獲得四十法郞的票子。房子是犯人自己建造修理，書寫着「救世軍的房子」和「希望的房子」，因爲管理老是救世軍官員「査理士賓」。他是第一次大戰後被派到該島工作的。但到了一九四六年，法當局才把它取消。</p>
<p>火燒島在台灣本島之東的太平洋中，離台東有十八哩。凡是日人認爲足以妨害他統治的台灣人民，就將他們送到這孤島上去，罰做苦工，至死不放回來。島上猶設備簡陋的監牢；監禁初來的囚犯，開了兩三年之後，日間可以解除脚鐐。監牢的四周密佈電網，以防逃逸和叛變。在海灘邊，不准船舶停泊或靠近此島航行，囚犯也不准走近海灘，否則格殺勿論。</p>
<p>這個島到我國接收台灣後蔡　解放，所有凡人全都放歸。現在只變成了沒有人烟的荒島了。</p>
<h3>貝爾納斯揭露：四強外交秘密</h3>
<p>— 珊</p>
<p>這消息來的時候已在夜間，到了翌日一早，才來訪總統和我。我立刻到白宮去，陸海兩部長不久也到了。李赫海軍上將主張應立刻接受日本的提議。我對總統說，容再考慮一下去回答這文書。</p>
<p>我說：「我們爲何要退讓無條件投降的要求，這要在投擲原子彈，和蘇聯加入作戰之前提出的。如果有什麽條件要接受的話，應該由美國，而不是日本，來提出。」總統同意我的見解，命我起草答復。文中包括三要點：　自投降時起，天皇及日本帝國政府統治國家之權限，置於聯合國最高司令官之下。　日島應命令及確保，日本政府及日本帝國大本營，爲履行波茨坦宣言，簽證於投降條件。並立刻命令日軍停止作戰。　根據彼茨坦宣曾前後成立日本人民自由意志之政府。</p>
<p>八月十一日送出這答復文書，我深信日本必能接受的。十四日下午四時候，才接獲我們駐瑞士大使哈之生的電話，通知我日本　文的內容，我就令陸部接通倫敦。莫斯枓和重慶的無綫電路，就把哈立生的消息通知三國的外長。五時半，我把會話的經過報吿總統，一切措施均經核准。六時，瑞士使館外交代辦葛拉斯里氏來訪，把日本來文讀給我聽。一小時後，杜　門總統向全世界宣佈，這次最可怕的戰事的結果。</p>
<p>日本在投降之前的一切，將來當有詳細的紀載。據向日本高級官吏探詢，和所得的公文材料看來，日本在投降之前五星期，對於史達林的意旨，猶無所知。直到一九四五年七月六日，中國外長宋子文氏到了草斯科，日人才疑到蘇聯的意向。那時外相東條曾說：「我們知道宋氏在莫斯科受到優還招待，並與史達林有所商討……也許有什麽條約要締結一。由此可見就是在那時候，日本的情報工作效率並不強。（全譯本即日出版，預約或申報館）</p>

<h3>United States Authorities Reach Consensus: Aid to China Program Under Study; Detailed Plan to be Submitted to Congress</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch] New York, 13th - Radio: Washington News - Congressman Lant requests the State Department to release the widely differing Wedemeyer Report. Mr. Lant believes that the report must advocate for immediate and substantial aid to the Chinese government, stating, "Despite its shortcomings, Chairman Chiang and his government remain the only bulwark against communism in the East."</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference on the 12th that the United States still hopes for the expansion of the National Government of China's foundation. He mentioned that no decision has been made yet on whether the United States will present any new proposals to the Chinese government regarding this matter. The State Department hopes to have precise recommendations regarding aid to China ready for submission to Congress when it convenes in regular session in January of next year, believing that Congressional action after that time would not take too long. A reporter asked Marshall whether any "political recommendations" would be attached to the aid package for China. The Secretary replied that he could not answer that question at this time. He also declined to comment on the Chinese government's suppression of the Democratic League. Marshall told those asking questions that regarding the China issue, they should pay attention to two factors: the Chinese people and the Communist Party. He stated that in some areas, these two have close relations, while in others, they do not. One reporter mentioned that there was an incident last year regarding the transportation of relief supplies to China and asked if such an incident might occur again. Marshall replied that future relief supplies would not cause such a situation because the situation at the port of Shanghai has greatly improved in the past few months. He stated that a large number of supplies are being transported into China via Shanghai and that he has not received any reports of congestion in the warehouses. He stated that he had not read a news report from Singapore claiming that Wedemeyer had suggested dividing China into three parts, and he declined to comment on this news. Marshall explained why the $300 million aid to China figure he mentioned has not been finalized, stating that because Senator Vandenberg had raised the issue of aid to China, he roughly offered this estimate. He stated that the U.S. administration is now trying to determine the best way to aid China, and the procedure is under study. He also explained that the plan under consideration is one that would help China alleviate the pressure of inflation. Marshall revealed that he had, in August 1946, January and February of this year, and shortly before his trip to the capital of Brazil in August of this year, sought funds for China from the Export-Import Bank. A reporter asked if the bank was not very sympathetic to the loan requests. He replied that he did not mean that, pointing out that the bank's charter has strict regulations regarding the certainty of repayment for loans or credit. Marshall stated that in the past, the plans submitted to the bank by China had some military value related to the Chinese civil war. He pointed out that these plans were for the rehabilitation of the Pinghan Railway, the restoration of Shanghai's public utilities, the rehabilitation of China's coal industry, and the reconstruction of several ports. He continued, stating that the projects in the proposal would be important for China's economic development. He declined to comment on whether the proposed aid to China would be allocated to the National Government and Communist-controlled areas according to the provisions of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. (Debate of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, published on the lower left corner of page 2)</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Republican Congressman Judd stated: "If the U.S. aid to China plan cannot be implemented before April of next year, I am afraid it will be too late. I deeply hope that Marshall's plan will be the beginning of genuine aid to China, but everything is still uncertain. For the past two or three years, Congress has consistently supported aid to China, but the State Department has failed to cooperate. The basic need now is to assist China in its civil war to defeat the Communist Party and prevent inflation. Once the Chinese civil war ends, its budget can be balanced within a year. It is difficult to predict how Congress will vote on Marshall's proposal, but this proposal at least shows that the State Department has recognized this need, and I hope that a practical course of action can be decided soon."</p>
<h3>Government Has Not Yet Learned of Marshall's Proposed Aid to China: Dong Xianguang Declares at Reception</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch, Nanjing, 13th] Regarding Secretary of State Marshall's statement to the joint meeting of the U.S. Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee that the State Department will propose an aid to China plan to Congress, providing $318 million in aid to China within this fiscal year, Director of the Executive Yuan Information Office Dong Xianguang replied to reporters at a press conference: "The Chinese government has not yet learned the details of Marshall's statement, so I have no comment to make." According to reporters, Marshall had to make a public and concrete guarantee to the Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee regarding U.S. aid to China due to pressure from Foreign Minister Wang, but this guarantee is in fact very vague and cannot satisfy either the Chinese government or the American people. The crux of the matter at present is the timeliness of the aid, not the numbers allowed on paper or orally. China's situation requires extremely urgent assistance, and Marshall's guarantee is like trying to quench a fire too late. Therefore, Marshall's statement is not as well-received as those of Roosevelt and Truman in the past. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing has resolutely refused to disclose whether the Chinese government welcomes it, and Director Dong ultimately declared a evasive silence. At the same time, the debate between some pro-aid individuals in the United States and Marshall will become increasingly fierce. Marshall is now facing a test, and whether the U.S. foreign policy under his leadership is fair and makes the American people feel safe and satisfied depends on future actions.</p>
<h3>Opinions of Chinese and Foreign Business Communities in This City on U.S. Aid to China</h3>
<p>[United Press, This City Dispatch] Business and financial figures in Shanghai stated that the $300 million+ aid to China after the end of the Marshall Plan could save China from bankruptcy, but it is not enough to revive China's post-war transportation and industry. The total amount of aid could offset its foreign exchange losses, which are approximately $190 million in this fiscal year, and could allow the Nanjing government to import necessary food, cotton, fertilizer, kerosene, gasoline, and machine oil. The government should be pleased with this temporary assistance, but they must be extremely disappointed that a larger sum is not allocated for the development of major projects, such as transportation, electricity, fertilizer plants, and various light industries.</p>
<p>Foreign business leaders here speculate that Marshall's unwillingness to include China in the recovery program, as was done with Europe, stems from his recognition that the civil war shows no sign of immediate end, making long-term recovery plans futile. If peace is ever achieved, Washington can be expected to aid China's recovery, but for now, it seems that at most, they will only aid the Nanjing government to prevent it from collapsing. The most hopeful aspects of aid to China at present are the supply of sufficient food and the implementation of food distribution in coastal cities. Another hope is that the government's foreign exchange reserves can be maintained and that military needs do not have to be reduced.</p>
<h3>China's Attitude on the Japanese Peace Conference Issue Remains Unchanged; The United States Continues to Exchange Views with China and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Nanjing, 13th] A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated: China will not change its attitude toward the Japanese peace conference because the Soviet Union opposes China being a convener of the German peace conference. The Chinese government maintains the position stated by Foreign Minister Wang several weeks ago, that the Japanese peace treaty should first be discussed by the Four Powers. The Soviet Union's attitude toward China at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference does not affect China's attitude toward the Japanese peace conference. According to reports from London, diplomatic observers there predicted that China might change its attitude toward the Japanese peace conference after the Soviet Union opposed China as the convener of the German peace conference. The Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement is intended to respond to this report.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference that there has been no progress in the past month regarding the convening of the Japanese peace conference. The United States is still exchanging views with the governments of China and the Soviet Union on a cooperative process related to the Japanese peace treaty.</p>
<h3>U.S. Economic Aid to China Will Help Stabilize Prices: Vice Minister of Finance Xu Botu Reports at National Economic Council</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch, Nanjing, 13th] Vice Minister of Finance Xu Boyuan reported on the current price and financial situation in Shanghai at the National Economic Council on the 13th, pointing out that the Shanghai market has recently improved due to rumors of a successful U.S. loan, with both gold and banknotes falling in value.

<h3>Regular Meeting of the National Economic Council</h3>
<p>[Our Own Dispatch, Nanjing, 13th] The National Economic Council held a regular meeting at 3 PM on the 13th, primarily discussing the recommendations of the three committee members who went to Shanghai to investigate prices. Apart from guiding speculative capital into the right track, it was decided to hand it over to the Ministry of Finance to handle as appropriate. The committee members all believed that tightening credit, properly using funds, and controlling the financial market were the most appropriate steps, and they deeply hoped that the financial authorities would strictly implement them. Regarding the tax system improvement, it was handed over to the Financial Group Committee members Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, Huang Yuanbin, Xiao Zheng, Shi Kuiling, and other seven people for further study. The committee members expressed many opinions on financial and economic policies, but no decision was made. Guiding Chinese nationals to use overseas deposits to purchase machinery and equipment was handed over to the Export Control Commission for preliminary study before making a decision. The meeting also discussed the joint distribution of cotton yarn and the joint purchase of cotton, but because it was of great importance and difficult to implement, it was decided to deliberate at length before conducting further research. Secondly, the industrial, commercial, and transportation sections of the economic reform plan have already been drafted and completed by the Secretariat. When submitted to the meeting for discussion, the committee members unanimously advocated that the committee members should first review it before convening a special conference for careful discussion. The Secretariat made the following reports at the meeting on the 13th: The National Economic Council has already formulated opinions on the Ministry of Economic Affairs' proposed standards for re-evaluating the value of the ministry's investment projects, and the Executive Yuan will follow suit. The Sino-U.S. Agricultural Technology Cooperation Program has been approved by the Executive Yuan. The 37th year Grain Production Increase Plan has also been approved by the Executive Yuan.</p>

<h3>Deng Wenyi Reports on the War Situation: Street-by-Street Fighting in Shijiazhuang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Director Deng Wenyi of the National Defense Ministry's Information Bureau, at a press conference held this afternoon at the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, reported on the war situation, stating: The isolated armies fighting valiantly in Yuncheng, Yulin, and Shijiazhuang in North China are facing attacks from the bandits with forces five to ten times their own. Yuncheng and Yulin have not fallen. In Shijiazhuang, due to strategic considerations, the main force of the National Army has been transferred, with only one division commander leading slightly more than two regiments voluntarily remaining to defend the city, engaging in heroic and arduous combat. Nie Rongzhen, concentrating all his strength in North China, claiming a force of 100,000, is besieging our less-than-a-division force. Most of our defending soldiers have already made heroic sacrifices. Street fighting has been ongoing for three days, with the final battle now involving the seizure of every street and house, exacting a heavy price from the enemy. (Continued on Page 2, Column 1)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Review of the American Aid to China Plan</h3>
<p>The United States Congress is scheduled to hold a special session on the 17th of this month to discuss the pressing issues of aid to Europe and aid to China. The Foreign Affairs Committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives first met on the 11th to hear Secretary of State Marshall's appeal to quickly aid countries that have suffered war damage. Regarding the Chinese portion, Secretary of State Marshall stated that the State Department eagerly anticipates aiding China and intends to request Congress to allocate 300 million US dollars for aid to China, adding: "Inflation is a difficult problem for China and must be helped to improve; and the Chinese government should also take steps to prevent inflation so that our aid to China can achieve at least seventy percent effectiveness." After hearing Secretary of State Marshall's remarks, we feel that the issue of American aid to China still requires further review by both sides.</p>
<p>Recently, in American public opinion, whether in opinions published in newspapers and magazines or in opinions expressed by the general American public, there has been a clear change in attitude towards China. Especially since Mr. Pulitzer's "Impressions of a Visit to China" was published in Life magazine, it has attracted widespread attention from the national government and the public. Reviewing the discussions published by Americans in the past month, we can see that the United States is unanimously sympathetic to China's appeal, moving from "concern" to "anxiety." Everyone advocates for immediate and comprehensive aid to China, and that aid plans to China and Europe should be submitted to Congress for discussion simultaneously, so that the United States can adopt a policy of balanced stability in both Europe and Asia. Ambassador Stuart, General Wedemeyer, and Congressmen Vandenberg, Martin, and Judd, can all see the big picture and make this argument. However, in today's United States, there is still a small group of people who advocate "Europe first, the Far East second," and that the United States should only aid Europe to counter Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe; and then aid China. Their specific reasons are based on narrow views, but they can cater to the inertia of some who lack a sufficient understanding of the issue. In the cracks of these various opinions, where will the American diplomatic authorities ultimately go? It still depends on Secretary Marshall's choice? But after reading Marshal's remarks released the day before yesterday, he said: "The situation in China is different from the situation in Europe. Europe needs urgent aid to prevent the import of important goods from coming to a standstill, otherwise famine and industrial bankruptcy will occur; but the Chinese problem is different, China's imports are not facing an immediate threat of coming to a standstill, and China has its own resources." Here, Marshall seems to have been somewhat influenced by the latter opinion.</p>
<p>Today, the issue of American aid to China may become one of the themes of the Democratic and Republican presidential campaigns. Republican leader Vandenberg has firmly advocated that China should be included in the scope of American foreign aid. New York Governor Dewey also recently gave a speech, also accusing President Truman of abandoning China, an ally. After returning to the country from the Far East, Republican Congressman Judd has even more loudly pointed out that MacArthur's biggest trouble is the situation in China. Even Republican presidential candidate Taft also believes that aid to China is more important than aid to Europe. He said: "Before considering aid to Europe, the United States should first consider the proposal to aid China." From this, it can be seen that the Republican leader's active advocacy of aid to China has been frankly revealed to the American people. But in all fairness, President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall have also established the principles for aiding China: Aid to China is equivalent to aiding the United States itself. All Americans who have been to the Far East recognize this point. Pulitzer is like this, and Judd is also like this. We believe that whether Chinese or American, everyone agrees with Pulitzer and Judd's views. In terms of the current situation in the Far East, the interests of China and the United States are completely consistent. Aid to China is equivalent to aid to the United States, which has become an indisputable conclusion. President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall must also be aware of this. Marshall's reply to Republican Congressman Fulton also said: "The stability of China is extremely important to the United States and the world." This is a very good proof. However, the focus of the issue of aid to China is how to make it effective? Marshall said, "The US government hopes that this aid will be effective," which can be described as hitting the nail on the head. We believe that American aid to China is like a doctor's use of medicine. It must not only be "timely" but also the amount of medicine must be "just right." If it is past the time, the medicine will become ineffective; if the amount is insufficient, it will also be equal to zero. According to Marshall's aid to China plan, it is divided into two parts: The United States will provide 60 million US dollars in aid to China before July 1 of next year; After June 30 of next year, 20 million US dollars will be provided to China every month until July 1, 1949. The total amount is 200 million US dollars. Based on this, American aid is not only not "timely," but the amount is also obviously insufficient. If the amount is insufficient, and the aid is not timely, then even if the wish is grand, how can it be effective? Marshall still wants to use these 300 million US dollars to help China improve its monetary system. While the kindness is touching, it is not easy to say "hope to be effective."</p>
<p>However, if we observe from another perspective, Secretary of State Marshall, in view of the state of inflation in China, has formulated this aid to China plan and submitted it to a special meeting of Congress for discussion, so that both the Chinese government and the people can obtain real benefits. This kindness and goodwill are still worthy of our praise. At the same time, we ourselves should also take this opportunity to deeply reflect, and our government and people should strive for self-reliance first. The so-called "Heaven helps those who help themselves," we must first seek self-reliance before we can get help from friendly countries. We must never have the mentality of relying on foreign aid and not seeking self-reliance. The Chinese people should first launch a self-restraint movement psychologically to eliminate this unprogressive concept of "relying on foreign aid." Marshall's plan, observed from the two angles of "timely" and "amount," will indeed make American aid ineffective, but if we can uphold the firm belief of "self-reliance," earnestly implement our own plan, and show that American aid can be effective, then when the US Congress discusses the Marshall Plan for aid to China, Republican congressmen will surely stand up and strive to revise the Marshall Plan so that it can be timely and effective. Therefore, the focus of the American aid to China issue can be said to be the key still lies in our government and people.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Seek to Achieve a "Three Demands" Policy; The National Military and Civilians Should Raise Awareness</h3>
<p>"Continued from Page 1" Before reporting on the war situation, Deng said: Because the Communist bandits' old nest and base have been broken, and supply from outside the border has been cut off, the bandit-occupied areas have exhausted their sources of troops and food, and after being forced to implement a hollow tactics, they have mobilized all their forces, crossed the Yellow River under the slogan of a general counter-offensive, and roamed north of the Yangtze River, in order to achieve the goals of seeking troops, seeking clothing, seeking food, destroying traffic, expanding their strength, and replenishing themselves locally. This conspiracy and trickery deserves the vigilance of the national military and civilians.</p>
<p>For two months, the Communist bandits have been roaming south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River, avoiding decisive battles with the main force of the National Army, rotating and milling around, and drilling through gaps to harass. Their purpose of seeking clothing, seeking food, and seeking troops has been partially achieved because the National Army has avoided dispersing its forces and has not stationed troops everywhere, and the people have no self-defense forces. As a result, the loss of life and property of the people has been extremely great, clothing has been plundered, food has been distributed, and forced conscription has been countless. The Communist bandits have gained a temporary respite and have recently launched a propaganda offensive, saying that they will roam across the southern bank of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River is not like the Yellow River, and it is not easy for bandits to sneak across, but in view of the roaming of the Communist bandits in Lu, Su, Yu, E, and Wan, plundering the clothing and food that the people rely on for their livelihoods as much as possible, and forcibly coercing every strong young person to join the army, be a party member, and carry a civilian husband, in order to break the Communist bandits' continued expansion of roaming and the "three demands" tactics of seeking clothing, seeking food, and seeking troops, we must prevent problems before they occur, and to avoid being destroyed by life and life when bandits roam, only the national military and civilians must raise their awareness, strengthen mobilization, and eliminate the current Communist bandits, so that democracy and freedom can be truly guaranteed.</p>
<p>To break the bandits' three-demand tactics, only a thorough implementation of general mobilization is possible. Governments in areas where bandits roam should implement a wartime system as much as possible. Politics must effectively cooperate with the military. People must begin to live a wartime life. How to strengthen the self-defense capabilities of local people, how to concentrate food, and control materials so that bandits cannot arbitrarily coerce people to join the army, be a civilian husband, and cannot easily seek clothing, seek food, and replenish themselves locally are all urgent tasks at hand, and they must be implemented quickly and effectively with the unity of the military, government, and people in order to effectively prevent bandits from crossing the Yangtze River. If the National Army can get the combined strength of politics and the people, it can concentrate its forces and gradually eliminate the bandits north of the Yangtze River and south of the Yellow River.</p>
<h3>Content of Chen Cheng's Address</h3>
<p>"Continued from Page 1" Industrial production was originally 9 million tons, but now it is only 1.25 million tons, accounting for about 14 percent. Mineral production was originally 30 million tons, but now it is only 6 million tons, accounting for about 20 percent. Power generation was originally 1.71 million kilowatts, but now it is only 210,000 kilowatts, accounting for about 12.8 percent. The railway mileage was originally 11,100 kilometers, but now it is only 1,750 kilometers, accounting for about 15 percent. The transportation capacity was originally 6.5 million tons, but now it is only 510,000 tons, accounting for about 7.7 percent. And the numbers recently destroyed by the Communist bandits have not yet been included. Therefore, based on the general ideal development, even if we want to restore the original foundation, I am afraid that it cannot be achieved in the short term. Therefore, before the military is deployed in the Northeast, making unplanned construction will only increase the financial burden, and before the restoration of water and electricity, the lack of power will make it even more difficult to resume work. At the same time, the intermittent transportation in the rear and the large-scale exchange of production materials are not permitted by the environment. And promoting domestic and foreign investment and utilizing Japanese reparations machines cannot be done in the short term. Chen then put forward four points as a reference for determining the focus of future work. First: Eliminating the Communist bandits, recovering lost land, and unifying the country to ensure the integrity of territorial sovereignty is the main part of nationalism that has not been fully implemented in the early revolution, and it is also a prerequisite for peaceful construction. The primary task of the later revolution is to quell the rebellion and fight the Communist bandits with all our strength. Although the Communist bandits' so-called sixth offensive has failed militarily, we must intensify our suppression in politics and economics, and fundamentally eliminate it. We must never allow a seventh offensive. In the process of continuing this struggle, we must pay special attention to the Communist bandits' provocations and cultural poisons, and mutual attacks. Second: In terms of politics, promote local autonomy, organize and train the people, and improve grassroots political organizations to lay the foundation for constitutional government. In addition, the following should also be noted: Provincial, city, and county governments must not leave their jurisdiction. If the situation is extremely bad, they must break up into political work teams and maintain close contact and continue to open their doors to compete. In order to change the aforementioned purpose, the provincial and municipal government organizations should become combat bodies. Third: Implement the economic principles of people's livelihood, work hard to increase production, and strive for reasonable distribution. All future measures should first ensure that the production and resources of the Northeast are not used by the enemy and set a minimum requirement. Fourth, develop culture, universalize education, and establish the ideology of the Three Principles of the People to enhance the people's confidence in the country, the nation, and the government. In the future, the Northeast can also try to implement planned education.</p>
<h3>Beiping-Shanghai Exchange Rate Soars</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] Today, the Shanghai exchange rate in Beiping soared, reaching 90 yuan. This surge was led by Tianjin. The official exchange rate of the national bank has been adjusted to 45 yuan since the 11th, and the premium has doubled. It is generally speculated that it may be related to the suspension of forward foreign exchange sales this time. Because the suspension of forward foreign exchange sales symbolizes that foreign exchange will rise in the near future, gold, banknotes, and department stores have all surged. In addition, the war in Shijiazhuang has also had an impact.</p>
<h3>Fen River to Build a Reservoir; Todd Agreed in Taiyuan; Todd Left Beiping Yesterday and Flew Back to Shanghai</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 13th] United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration water conservancy expert Todd. Left Beiping by plane to Shanghai today. Todd's trip to the north has roughly decided on the construction of a reservoir in Lancun, Fenhe, to transform the country around Taiyuan into a fertile land. At the invitation of Yan Xishan, he flew to Taiyuan on the 9th and held a meeting with Yan and Jin's water conservancy engineering experts to study the Fenhe reservoir construction. He also went to Zhacun, 60 miles northwest of Taiyuan, to conduct a survey. As a result, it was decided to build a dam in Lancun before Jing Le in the upper reaches of Fenhe was recovered, but the Japanese plan was abandoned and the proposal made 15 years ago was restored to keep the reservoir at a height of more than five yards so that in addition to irrigation, it is also suitable for power generation. Jin's Water Conservancy Bureau has re-formulated a detailed plan based on Todd's suggestions, and after Todd's verification, it can be started. It is estimated that the total project cost will be 2 million US dollars, and half of it will be asked for American assistance. Todd will serve as the chief engineer. After the reservoir is completed, the downstream of Fenhe will become fertile land. The life of the reservoir can reach 40 to 50 years, and the project cost will be recovered year by year.</p>

Shen once served as the battalion commander of the Anti-Japanese Army in Jizhong North and the captain of the Changling County Security Brigade. He said: In early October, the Communist bandits transported 800 taels of narcotics from Shukou to Gongzhuling and sold them locally at 700 yuan per tael of circulating coupons, earning a total of 56 million circulating coupons. They immediately exchanged them for cloth, salt, and other important materials in preparation for transporting them to the bandit area. By the end of the month, before they could be transported out, Gongzhuling was recovered by the National Army.</p>

<h3>Heated Debate in U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee on Aid to China Issue, Wedemeyer Report May Be Partially Released</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] Secretary of State Marshall said on the 12th that the entire Wedemeyer Report may never be released because "I believe releasing the report would be detrimental to either the Chinese government or the U.S. government." Marshall, appearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, warned the committee that the current emergency aid, estimated at $597 million, may need to be increased if Congress delays action on the aid-to-Europe issue for too long. However, Marshall said that some parts of the Wedemeyer Report may eventually be made public. He said that the State Department is currently working on this matter. Marshall made this statement after being questioned repeatedly by Republican Congressman Fulton, who said that he wanted to know when the Wedemeyer Report would be released. Marshall said that "the stability of China is undoubtedly extremely important for the United States and the world." However, he continued, "The aid issue is an extremely complex problem. To make American aid effective, there are many things that China should do." Marshall said that he also disagreed with some of Wedemeyer's conclusions, but solemnly stated that this was not his reason for prohibiting the release of the Wedemeyer Report. Fulton asked if the State Department wanted to request funds from Congress for aid to China without providing sufficient facts, and he believed that this policy was not a smart way to do things. Marshall replied: "Regarding such international events, not all facts can be made public. This almost makes all negotiations impossible. Many facts cannot be released except to a few highly trustworthy people." During Judd's attempt to investigate the planned aid-to-China issue, a heated debate and questioning occurred. The debate ended due to objections from New York Democratic Congressman Bloom. However, Judd explained that if the situation in the Far East continues to deteriorate, he is deeply skeptical about the success of aid to Europe. Judd had just returned last week after traveling in China and various parts of the Far East. He said that responsible people in the Chinese government wanted to know why the United States was not giving them aid in China's anti-communist war. Judd said that the Chinese people asked him the following five questions:</p>
<p>Is the race issue related to the attitude of the United States?</p>
<p>Does the United States still believe that the CCP are merely reformers and are not directed by the Kremlin?</p>
<p>Does the United States believe that the China issue is ultimately not important?</p>
<p>Does the United States think that the situation in China is not as critical as that in Europe?</p>
<p>Whether the Chinese government failed to fulfill its obligations to the United States during or after the war.</p>
<p>Marshall replied: Such questions are "unbelievable." The United States has never thought about the race issue. He said: The stability of China is very important to the United States, and the United States has never neglected this. This is no longer a question. The whole question is what kind of action the United States is actually going to take. He continued: "This is one of the most difficult and complex situations I have ever encountered, but I am not completely pessimistic and believe that we can still find a solution."</p>
<p>Judd said: "I feel it is important to express an attitude to the Chinese government, explaining that if they cooperate with us, we will give them aid." Marshall bluntly replied: "I don't want to criticize the Chinese government here." At this point, Bloom rose to object, saying that the discussion had deviated far from the topic of this committee's discussion of aid to Europe.</p>
<p>Prior to this, Marshall told the committee that the State Department intends to have the China relief plan ready by the time Congress reconvenes next January at the latest, if not sooner. He said that the State Department has been looking for practical ways to aid China since last year, but has found that most solutions are "very impractical."</p>
<p>Judd asked whether Marshall's aid plan outline proposed on the 11th is appropriate when the military situation in China continues as it is now. Marshall replied: Unless China's military expenses are reduced, it is indeed difficult to find any way to benefit China. This is the most destructive fact in the situation in China. Judd asked: If North China and the Northeast are controlled by the CCP, would this be contrary to the interests and foreign policy of the United States? Marshall replied: "That's exactly what I mean." At the same time, the White House announced that President Truman will address a joint session of the House and Senate when the special Congress reviews foreign aid and price issues. Also, when Marshall appeared before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Commerce Secretary Harriman appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Harriman served as chairman of the 19-member special committee, which requested at the end of last week that $12 billion to $17 billion be allocated to the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe and to prevent a third world war. Marshall's appearance strongly urged the passage of $597 million for emergency aid to France, Italy, and Austria, and he explained that this was the minimum figure.</p>
<p>(United Press, Washington, 12th) Marshall told the House Foreign Affairs Committee today that the Nationalist government "must go further before we can go further." About 1,000 U.S. military officers are helping the Chinese government fight the communists, and the United States has agreed to assist China in training new troops in Taiwan. "But the China issue is far more than just the military situation. China is of great importance to the United States and the world. This view has not diminished, and the key is what can be done if China cannot do much. Nanjing must do a lot before we here can do more." Marshall also replied to Congressman Judd's question of "Is there any hope for remedy before China's huge military budget is reduced?" and said: "This is the crux of the matter." Judd asked: "Is it reasonable to use the money of the American people to aid China only to treat the symptoms and not the root cause?" Marshall said in a straightforward tone: "Mr. Judd, I really don't want to turn to criticizing the Chinese government during this committee discussion."</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton ended this discussion by saying: "This issue is over."</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] New York, 13th broadcast: Flushing news, the Philippines was elected as a member of the Trusteeship Council with a majority of 41 votes.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 13th] The United Nations General Assembly held its plenary session for the eleventh time since November 1st. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall's two major proposals at the United Nations General Assembly, one advocating the establishment of a "Small Assembly" and the other advocating the establishment of a Korean Election Supervisory Group, are expected to receive final voting approval. The General Assembly will also elect a non-permanent member of the Security Council to succeed Poland. India and Ukraine are evenly matched in successive votes, resulting in a stalemate. India has already announced its withdrawal yesterday, so Ukraine is expected to be elected. In addition, the General Assembly must also add two members to the Trusteeship Council. The candidates are the Philippines, Norway,  Romania, and Costa Rica. The Philippines and Norway are expected to be elected.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 12th] Regarding the Korean independence plan, it will soon be finalized by the General Assembly. According to this plan, a nine-nation delegation will be sent by the United Nations to supervise elections in Korea to create an independent Korean government with an army to defend its security by March 31st of next year. If possible, U.S. and Soviet troops will be withdrawn by July 1st of next year. However, Soviet resistance is expected to force the delegation to operate only in southern Korea, which will delay the establishment of an independent government in that region until around 1948.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 13th] The South Korean Provisional Government issued a statement after its 79th cabinet meeting, stating, "We firmly believe in the possibility of establishing an independent Korean government. Although a small number of groups in South Korea agree with the simultaneous withdrawal of U.S. and Soviet troops, we believe it is too early to say so. North Korea is now intensifying its military strength, threatening South Korea. Under these circumstances, if U.S. and Soviet troops actually withdraw, it would be tantamount to giving North Korea a good opportunity to invade South Korea."</p>

<h3>U.S. Response to De Gaulle's Proposal is Lukewarm</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 12th] General de Gaulle proposed that France, Britain, and the United States form an alliance to counter the Soviet Union. Washington's reaction to this news today was not enthusiastic. There was no direct comment from diplomatic circles. Only an official who usually publishes State Department policies made two private statements: On the surface, forming such an alliance at present would tend to divide Europe, which the U.S. government has repeatedly opposed. Part of Marshall's plan to aid Europe is based on the possibility of restoring trade between East and West. If it is divided, it will inevitably fail.</p>
<h3>United States Attaches Importance to Middle East Oil Fields, Believes They are Tied to Fate of Europe, Asia, and Africa</h3>
<p>[Reuters, New York, 12th] Henderson, Director of the State Department's Near East and Africa Division, delivered a speech to the Academy of Political Science here today, declaring that the fate of the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa is tied to the Middle East oil fields not being controlled by a hostile power. For the sake of U.S. security and world peace, aggression in the Middle East will not be allowed. The Middle East's oil is the lifeblood of industry and transportation in South Asia and Africa, and it is also linked to the future destiny of Europe. If a hostile power occupies these resources, it will hinder the subsequent revival of Western Europe, delay the economic development of South Asia and Africa, and cast a shadow over the entire world for many years. The power referred to by Henderson is obviously the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Harriman Calls for Aid to Europe, Emphasizes U.S. Definitely Has Ability to Provide Foreign Aid, U.S. to Require Uranium as Compensation for Loans</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] New York, 13th broadcast: Washington news, when Chairman Vandenberg of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee discussed the issue of aid to Europe in the committee, he asked Philip, Director of the International Trade Policy Division of the State Department, whether the government was considering obtaining platinum from the Belgian Congo as a price for U.S. aid to Europe? Philip replied that senior government officials are currently considering this approach. Vandenberg asked the government to provide more information on this matter. Congressman Jonkman told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the government's efforts to provide aid to Europe are too slow, and that France, Italy, and Austria must wait until March of next spring to receive the $597 million in emergency aid proposed by Marshall. Harriman did not accept this accusation, claiming that the government is working at top speed to implement aid to Europe as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Commerce Secretary Harriman told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the $597 million in emergency aid to France, Italy, and Austria can curb the trend of decreasing U.S. exports.</p>
<p>The amount of U.S. exports has decreased from 13 billion yuan in the second quarter of this year to 11 billion yuan in the third quarter of this year. The amount of exports in the fourth quarter of this year will not decrease further, and with the help of new funds, it should be able to increase in the first quarter of 1948. Harriman went on to present various figures and facts to prove that the United States can fulfill the delivery obligations in the aid plan without much difficulty. He pointed out that the current coal output is only 3.5 percent of the total production, and the U.S. distribution and export certificate system can prevent excessive outflow of grain. Senator Connally raised the issue of British coal production. Harriman said that improvements in British labor and technology can enable the British coal industry to play a major role in the task of European revival.</p>

<h3>U.S. Plans to Re-Propose Forty-Year Treaty Against German Aggression at Foreign Ministers Conference; Discussion on Procedural Matters Still Yields No Results</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 13th] Marshall told the Congressional Political Committee on the 12th that when he attends the London Foreign Ministers Conference, he will re-propose the Four-Power Forty-Year Treaty to prevent German re-aggression. We must ensure that the people of Europe do not feel abandoned due to the sudden withdrawal of the United States from Europe. This treaty was originally proposed by former Secretary of State Byrnes and was discussed again at the Foreign Ministers Conference held in Moscow in April, but was rejected by the Soviet Union both times.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 13th] According to authoritative sources, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States will do their utmost to support the United States' proposal for a Four-Power Forty-Year Agreement to prevent Nazi re-aggression at the Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 12th] The representatives of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference discussed the agenda for the next Foreign Ministers Conference. The United Kingdom, France, and the United States suggested that the Austrian treaty be placed at the top of the agenda. The Soviet Union's counter-proposal was the opposite, and the result was still no result. The United Kingdom and France also suggested discussing economic principles before discussing the political organization of Germany. The United States' draft agenda will be submitted on the 13th, but the U.S. representative, Mr. Fei, said today that the order of the agenda items proposed by the Soviet Union should be revised. The British draft agenda stipulates the following order of discussion: 1. Report of the Austrian Treaty Committee; 2. Economic principles, post-war German industrial standards, compensation plans, including the plan to incorporate Saar into the French economic system; 3. The form and scope of Germany's interim political organization; 4. The treaty proposed by the United States for thorough disarmament of Germany under the supervision of the Four Powers; 5. Report of the Foreign Ministers' representatives on the procedures for preparing the German peace treaty; 6. Other matters. Soviet representative Mr. Smirnov stated that the Soviet Union does not neglect the Austrian treaty issue, as can be seen from the fact that the Soviet delegation has included the Austrian treaty issue in the agenda of the Foreign Ministers Conference. However, the Soviet Union believes that the purpose of convening the Foreign Ministers Conference was primarily to discuss the German peace treaty, so it should naturally discuss the German peace treaty first.</p>
<h3>Giant 54-Carat Diamond Given to British Heir as Wedding Gift</h3>

<h3>Review Results of Municipal Government Organization; Executive Yuan Believes Further Streamlining Still Needed; At Least One-Tenth of Section Chiefs and Employees Should Be Dismissed; News and Personnel Departments Should Be Changed to Offices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that the Shanghai Municipal Organization Regulations originally reviewed and determined by the Executive Yuan are too strict and may hinder work efficiency, so it specifically requested a re-review. The Executive Yuan convened the Shanghai Municipal Organization Regulations Review Committee again on the 10th of this month for another review. The Municipal Government also sent Director of the Social Bureau Wu Kaixian and Chief Advisor Wang Zhaoquan to Nanjing to state the reasons why the Municipal Government's institutions and personnel cannot be reduced. According to reporters who inquired from relevant parties, the Executive Yuan's research results believe that the Municipal Government's institutions still need to be streamlined and redundant personnel should be dismissed. It is believed that the number of advisors in the Municipal Government should be limited to six, and the number of appointed secretaries should be limited to five. Other senior personnel should be dismissed, and the system, such as the News and Personnel Departments, does not need to be so large and can be reorganized into offices. In terms of various bureaus, the principle should be not to set up sections. However, if necessary, sections may still be allowed to be set up. Except for the Social Affairs and Public Works Bureaus, where two appointed secretaries can be set up due to the complexity of affairs, other bureaus are limited to one appointed secretary. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Government has more than 40,000 personnel in total (including personnel from various business inspection institutions and police officers), and there are more than 3,000 office personnel alone, which is indeed too many. In particular, the number of section chiefs, committee members, and employees is not in line with the system and should be reduced. The Executive Yuan's representative stated that the reduction rate should be at least one-tenth. The Municipal Government hopes to maintain the status quo. Currently, the Municipal Government representative Wang Zhaoquan is still in Nanjing continuing negotiations.</p>
<p>[Another report] During this meeting, Mr. Wang tried hard to argue that Shanghai is a commercial center with complex circumstances. Based on reality, this is necessary to promote administrative work. Although there are 40,000 civil servants in the city, this actually includes police officers, street cleaners, and staff from various business units. The Municipal Government itself and the staff of various bureaus total about 3,000 people. If we follow the central government's regulations to reduce 1,800 people, with an average salary of 2 million yuan per person per month, the total is only 3.6 billion yuan per month, which the Municipal Government can still afford. Moreover, the business tax has recently been collected by the Municipal Government, so there should be no problem with expenditures.</p>
<p>Election Voting Date is Approaching; Drill to Be Held Tomorrow Afternoon</p>

The voting dates are set for the 21st to the 23rd, and the ballot counting dates are set for the 24th to the 26th. It was decided to borrow various schools in the city as polling stations, and Mayor Wu ordered the Education Bureau to notify each school to suspend classes for three days on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of this month. It is also reported that in order to enhance the work efficiency of polling station staff, the office will hold a lecture on the morning of the 15th and a voting drill on the upper floor of the Hongkou Small Vegetable Market at 3:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Six Japanese War Criminals Escorted to Hankou for Trial</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Six Japanese war criminals were escorted from the Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense to the Jiangshun ship at 5:00 p.m. yesterday and will set sail for Hankou tomorrow for trial. The list of the six criminals is as follows: 1. Lieutenant General Nara Akira, 58 years old, from Nagasaki, former commander of the Hankou Dispatch Army. During the War of Resistance, he massacred more than 200 Chinese people in Tianmen County, Hubei Province. After the victory, the criminal was actually repatriated to his country. After repeated negotiations with General MacArthur's headquarters by our government, he was finally escorted from Japan to Taiwan on April 21 of this year and escorted to Shanghai on the 28th. 2. Lieutenant General Ban Takeo, 56 years old, from Fukuoka, killed many Chinese civilians in China in 1932. 3. Lieutenant Colonel Endo Takio, 53 years old, from Miyazaki, served as a Japanese regiment commander in China during the War of Resistance and committed crimes against the Chinese people. 4.

<h3>Broadcasting Good Shows; Please Untie Your Purses; Winter Relief Needs 60 Billion Yuan; 200,000 Refugees Urgently Awaiting Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] The Municipal Winter Relief Committee has decided to hold a radio fundraising event at the Shanghai Radio Station on the 15th and 16th of this month to raise funds, and it will be broadcasted voluntarily by all public and private radio stations in the city. Yesterday at 3:00 p.m., the committee hosted a tea party at the Lido Garden to entertain people from the broadcasting and performing arts industries. Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiguan, Wang Xianqing, Wu Kaixian representing Yuan Wenzhang, and more than 100 people from the broadcasting and performing arts industries attended. First, Du Yuesheng gave a speech, stating: Although the Municipal Government has decided to allocate 10 billion yuan for this year's winter relief, the funds are still insufficient because the Relief General Office has ended this year and food and other materials must be raised on their own. It is estimated that a total of 60 billion yuan is needed. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically donate. Then, Speaker Pan gave a speech, stating: Relieving refugees is actually equivalent to relieving ourselves. There are 200,000 refugees in Shanghai. If they are allowed to suffer from hunger and cold, they will inevitably take risks, and society will not be peaceful. Therefore, even for our own safety, we should relieve refugees. Last time, to avoid social unrest and public anxiety during the conscription in the city, it was suggested that the government adopt a voluntary military system. Now, the voluntary soldiers have been recruited and have already been dispatched. However, it is painful to see that only 5 billion yuan has been raised for the 20 billion yuan needed to pay the voluntary soldiers' family allowance. This is truly an unfair society. Now, the winter relief funds are more important than the family allowance. It is hoped that the people of Shanghai will not wait until the fire is burning their eyebrows before they come to the rescue. Xu Jiguan also pointed out that saving people is saving ourselves, and donating more money is equivalent to saving more people. Wang Xianqing reported on the donation methods: 1. Increase the entertainment tax by 20%. 2. Hold a relief horse race. 3. Hold a charity soccer game. 4. Launch fundraising activities from all walks of life. Individuals and groups who donate more than 1 million yuan will be given certificates, and those who donate large amounts will be awarded plaques by the Social Bureau and the Municipal Government. Then, Yuan Wenzhang reported on the use of donations: 1. Establish shelters, two of which already exist in Caohejing and can accommodate 4,000 people. It is also planned to establish shelters in Zhabei Jiangwan to provide porridge and clothing. 2. Entrust charitable organizations to provide relief. 3. Cooperate with the Public Works Bureau to carry out work-for-relief programs.</p>
<p>[Another report] The committee has decided on the following broadcast schedule for the 15th and 16th: On the 15th, from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. will be Shanghai Opera, from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. will be storytelling, from 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. will be slapstick comedy, and from 11:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. will be stories.

<p>[This newspaper's report] Queripel, a British suspect in the murder of black market gold and foreign exchange broker Yu Shengxiao, was tried in the Criminal Division of the District Court yesterday afternoon. The verdict is scheduled to be announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>At 2:00 p.m., Queripel was escorted to the court by bailiffs from the Sinan Road Detention Center. Immediately, Judge Zhu Yuhuang, together with Prosecutor Ding Tongjun and Clerk Zhuang Zhide, took the stand and inquired about the situation from Queripel once again. The court then ordered the start of the verbal debate. The prosecutor stated: Our country has recovered extraterritoriality. Foreigners who commit crimes in China should be completely subject to Chinese law and be treated the same as Chinese people. At present, Chinese people who commit robbery and banditry are subject to special criminal regulations. The defendant in this case committed murder for money, which is a form of banditry. It should not be regarded as an ordinary murder case, and it should not be an exception because he is a foreigner. Moreover, this case is the first case of a British person being tried after the recovery of extraterritoriality. It should be handled with particular solemnity to set an example of equality between foreigners and Chinese people under Chinese law.</p>
<p>Clearly a Joint Principal Offender</p>
<p>Although the two mutually shirk responsibility for the murder of the victim Yu Shengxiao in this case, a review of the facts, such as how the two discussed the plan beforehand, how they borrowed hats for disguise, how they picked up Yu Shengxiao to board the car and drove to the countryside, and how they returned to Queripel's home to wash their hands and wipe off the bloodstains, leads to the conclusion that they are jointly responsible. If it was a matter of buying and selling gold bars, why would Queripel need to give a brown hat to Malai for disguise? Why did they drive the car to the countryside? Why did Malai go to Queripel's house to wash his hands and wipe off the bloodstains from his clothes when he returned? It can be seen that borrowing the hat for disguise was only for the convenience of concealing their identities, driving to the countryside was for the convenience of murder, and washing their hands and wiping off the bloodstains upon return was to eliminate traces of the murder. In short, regardless of who pulled the trigger, they are both clearly joint principal offenders.</p>
<p>The Situation Vividly Depicted</p>
<p>Malai and Yu Shengxiao did not know each other. In fact, it was Queripel who invited him to discuss the plan, drove to pick him up, asked him to disguise himself, and introduced him to Yu to sit in the car together, thereby jointly plotting the murder. If Queripel had not contacted him in the first place, Malai would not have known Yu Shengxiao and would not have committed the crime. Based on this, it can be seen that the defendant Queripel is actually the mastermind of the crime. After the prosecutor finished his argument, Queripel replied in court, "If I wanted to kill Yu Shengxiao to steal his gold bars, I could have lied to Yu to go to any location and murdered him. Why would I bring Malai along, let him witness the murder, and then testify in court? I am completely innocent." At this point, the prosecutor refuted his reply.</p>
<p>Defense Attorney's Argument</p>
<p>The defendant's lawyer then stood up to argue that the defendant was not guilty of murder, and the reasons were as follows: (A) Queripel was the driver, holding the steering wheel with both hands, how could he have held a gun to shoot Yu? (B) The murder weapon, bloody clothes, and bloody pants were all seized from Malai. (C) Based on the facts, the testimony of witnesses, and common sense, Queripel did not know in advance that Malai intended to kill Yu. He cannot be considered an accomplice and should be found not guilty by the court according to the law. By the time the statement was made, it was already past 4:00 p.m., so it was announced that the debate in this case was concluded and a date for the verdict was set.</p>
<h3>Movie Theaters Can Be Used as Shelters if They Close; Winter Relief Donations Will Still Be Implemented</h3>
<p>[This newspaper's report] Director of the Social Bureau Wu Kaixian told reporters yesterday that when he went to Nanjing, the Chairman summoned him to inquire in detail about the labor movement and price situation in the city and instructed him to pay close attention. As for the entertainment industry's opposition to the 20% winter relief donation added to ticket prices and the widespread rumor that Western film merchants will stop supplying films starting on the 16th, Director Wu believes that relieving refugees is more important than watching foreign films, so the added donation will still be implemented starting on the 16th.

<h3>Zhang Chunfan Deals with Leng Shan: Lawsuit Already Lodged with the District Prosecutor's Office; Charges Enumerated in Six Points: Enticement and Restriction of Freedom</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Zhang Chunfan, the manager of the Cathay Yue Opera Theater, was prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office for instigating the suicide of Xiao Dangui. He is currently detained in the Sinan Road Detention Center. Recently, his lawyer, Zhang, filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office against Leng Shan, a person involved in the case, for "enticing a woman and restricting her freedom." The lawsuit was submitted yesterday and is over a thousand words long, listing six charges against Leng Shan. The original complaint states: "Upon investigation of the sensational suicide case of Yue Opera actress Xiao Dangui (originally named Qian Chunyun, referred to as Ms. Qian below), she was the plaintiff's concubine, and they had cohabitated as a family for seven years with the purpose of permanent shared life. According to Article 1123, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Code, Ms. Qian was a member of the plaintiff's family. Ms. Qian was a well-known Yue Opera performer, renowned for her beauty and substantial private wealth. When she performed at the plaintiff's Cathay Yue Opera Theater, she was a leading actress (commonly known as a 'pillar'). After the reform of Yue Opera, the old scripts no longer suited the new trends, leading to the trend of compiling and performing new plays, and the defendant in this case was hired as a writer and director. Unexpectedly, the defendant coveted Ms. Qian's beauty and wealth, and taking advantage of his position, he used various means to entice her, causing Ms. Qian to feel unable to protect herself, which led to her suicide by poisoning.</p>
<p>Waiting Backstage to Offer Assistance</p>
<p>In April of this year, the defendant, along with Wu Shen (also a director), co-directed the play 'Qin Huai Moon,' with Ms. Qian playing the lead role. The play included a scene where she jumps into the Qin Huai River to commit suicide. To achieve realism, she had to jump from a height of over three feet onto the backstage area. Each time she jumped, the defendant waited backstage, excluding others, to personally catch her. This occurred more than seventy times. It is clear that the defendant used this as an initial plan to seduce Ms. Qian.</p>
<p>Using a Mailbox to Exchange Love Letters</p>
<p>After the defendant's initial enticement plan succeeded, he devised a way to borrow Liu Qiong's (a movie actor) mailbox to exchange love letters with Ms. Qian. If, as the defendant claimed, 'everything I discussed with her was about acting,' and it was true, then it would be perfectly proper and could be openly sent. Why the need for secrecy, borrowing someone else's mailbox? And why did he claim to have lost them when questioned by the police?</p>
<p>Instigating Divorce Was Expected</p>
<p>Furthermore, the defendant stated in his confession: 'I always called Xiao around 2 PM because Xiao had agreed beforehand that Zhang Chunfan would not be home at that time, so Xiao always answered my calls.' If the defendant and Ms. Qian had no ambiguous enticement or phone calls, it would be ordinary. Why was it necessary to only call Ms. Qian when the plaintiff was not at home? After the defendant's enticement plan succeeded, he used the love letters to coerce Ms. Qian into having sex with him, which was to be expected. The next step was to instigate Ms. Qian to leave the plaintiff, which was also anticipated.</p>
<p>Moving the Family to Avoid Guilt</p>
<p>On October 7th, Ms. Qian went out at night at the defendant's invitation. According to the defendant's admission, it was because the movie showing was too early, so they rode in a car to Zhaofeng Garden. When they visited the garden, it was past closing time, so the two walked back. However, Ms. Qian returned home at 11 PM that night. Who can believe that they were walking in the street at 8 PM? After the plaintiff discovered the October 7th incident, he investigated it once, but the plaintiff and Ms. Qian reconciled afterwards. Unexpectedly, at around 3 PM on October 13th, Ms. Qian and Shen Yitao had a secret conversation in neighbor Wei Meiying's room for ten minutes. Then, at 5 PM that afternoon, Ms. Qian took poison and died in Wei Meiying's room, leaving behind the words 'It's hard to be a person, hard to be a person, I'm dead.' What was this about? Was Shen Yitao instructed by the defendant to make Ms. Qian state her position? This is highly questionable. After Ms. Qian's death, the defendant moved his family to avoid guilt, which cannot be denied. Considering the above points, it is inevitable that the defendant violated Articles 298, Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law concerning the crime of restricting freedom. Therefore, in accordance with Article 213, Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Procedure Law, this lawsuit is filed."</p>

<h3>Car-jacking Bandit with Two Guns: Former U.S. Military Translator Plotted to Rob Dance Hall</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Chen Zhan Shi (also known as Zhi Gang, 23 years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong), the two-gun car-jacking bandit arrested in front of the Fuzhou Road Municipal Police Station on the afternoon of the 30th of last month, has been concluded after the Criminal Investigation Division applied for two detention inquiries. Because the criminal has military status, he will be transferred to the Garrison Headquarters for military trial. It is reported that the criminal graduated from Chongqing Overseas Chinese Second Middle School. During the War of Resistance, he served as a translator for the U.S. military supply office in the rear. After the victory, he was dismissed and traveled to Kunming, Guizhou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places.

<h3>Opening the Coffin to Examine the White Bones: Corpse Scene at Huinong Bridge, Wuxi: Skull and Neck Bones Removed and Transported to Shanghai for Further Examination: "Murderous King" Wang Gaosheng Nailed and Detained</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Wuxi, 11th] The murderous king, Wang Gaosheng, is from Tangnan Village, Jiangyin. His original name was Ren Gaosheng, nicknamed "A Gao Tou." He previously served as a company commander in the Tenth Detachment of the Loyalty and Salvation Army. Later, he betrayed the army with Chen Xiaoping and surrendered to the puppet regime, stationed in the Zhou Village area of Zhaobridge Township, relying on his position to kidnap and extort without restraint. In 1945, he murdered four villagers: Xu A Yu, Ren A Qi, Xu Wu's wife, and Ji Sun's wife. After the victory, he was spotted on the road by the family members of the victims, turned over to the police, and transferred to the District Court, which sentenced him to life imprisonment. Wang, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the High Court. During the High Court's review, it was determined that the initial judgment did not conduct a legal examination of the murdered villagers, and the conviction for murder was without legal basis. Therefore, at the end of last month, the original judgment was overturned and remanded for retrial.</p>
<p>On the 9th of this month, the presiding judge, Zhao Changnian, summoned the family members of the victims to court for questioning and ordered the coffins to be transported to the city for examination. On the evening of the 10th, the families of the deceased transported three coffins—those of Ji Sun's wife, Xu Wu's wife, and Xu A Yu—from the village to the riverbank of the railway bridge west of Huinong Bridge. However, the body of Ren A Qi was buried in a muddy pond and was difficult to transport to the city. At 8:00 AM on the 11th, Judge Zhao, accompanied by the forensic examiner, went to the corpse scene at the railway bridge. Because the area was small, the scene was moved to the wasteland behind Fulinsi Temple at Bridge No. 1 on the Xicheng Road for inspection. The workers were ordered to lift</p>
<p>three coffins</p>
<p>to the shore and open the coffin lids for legal examination. The crowd of onlookers was so large that it was impossible to move. All of the bodies in the coffins had become skeletons. Judge Zhao then set up a temporary public office at the corpse scene and questioned the family members of the deceased: Ji Ronggen (Ji Sun's wife's nephew) and Ji Xu's wife (the family members of Xu A Yu and Xu Wu's wife) about what happened. They stated that Ji Sun's wife was 58 years old when she was</p>
<p>cut in the left ear</p>
<p>with a sharp blade and then shot to death by Wang Gaosheng in May 1945. Xu A Yu and Xu Wu's wife were husband and wife. On July 19, 1944, they were kidnapped by Wang Gaosheng and strangled to death with ropes. Fearing his power, they hastily coffined the bodies without even changing their clothes. Xu Wu's wife was only 21 years old, beautiful, and Wang tried to take her as his wife but failed, so he killed her and her husband Xu A Yu, etc. Then the examination began. The bones of Ji Sun's wife were examined first, and it was found that there was a knife wound on the left ear skull, and the skull was shattered, confirming that she died from a knife wound. Next, Xu Wu's wife was examined and found to have a leather thread around her neck, still encircling the seven cervical vertebrae, with wounds on the fifth and fourth vertebrae, a bloodstain on the top of the skull, and rope marks on the left ankle. Both hands had</p>
<p>grass rope tied backward.</p>
<p>As a result, the skull and seven cervical vertebrae were removed. Finally, the bones of Xu A Yu were examined and found to have a grass rope around his neck, and rope marks on both hands. After a long examination, since no bone injuries were found, the skull and neck bones were removed and taken to the Shanghai Forensic Medicine Laboratory for examination before further processing. The skeletons were still collected by the families of the deceased and buried. It is said that the murderer Wang Gaosheng is still unrepentant, recruiting disciples in prison and acting as the "dragon head." Last month, he once rioted in prison and colluded with other prisoners to dig a hole in the wall in an attempt to escape. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and the criminal was nailed and detained.</p>

Now that the new grain has been harvested, the opportunity should be seized and the commissioners and county magistrates should be ordered to speed up the handling and collect all allotted and purchased grain amounts within three months after the field tax collection begins. As for the public and educational grain entrusted by the Ministry of Food to the China Farmers Bank and the Bank of China, the province should also treat it as military grain, assist as much as possible, and collect it at the key transportation hubs to await requisition. Wang Zhi, Director of the Finance Department of the Ministry of Finance, was sent to the province to supervise the handling. In addition, the Wu County Field Tax Provincial Order requires that it be collected and paid in full by the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Gentry Resolved to Beautify East Qian Lake; Sun Embankment and Chiang Embankment to Be Built Simultaneously</h3>

<h3>Cheng Increases Self-Defense Force; Plans to Establish a Teaching Brigade</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Jiangyin, 12th] In order to improve the self-defense strength of the people at all levels, County Magistrate Xu planned to establish six teaching brigades according to the standing brigade establishment of the county people's self-defense team promulgated by the Central Government, which is planned by Xu Shaoxian, chief of the fifth section. The brigades are planned to be established by the end of this month, completed by the 15th of next month, and start training for one month.

This plan was approved at the county township meeting on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Remnants of Bandits in Southern Dabie Mountains Implement a Three-Capture Policy</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Hefei, 12th] The bandit army entrenched in the mountainous areas of the counties south of the Dabie Mountains and north of the Yangtze River, due to excessive casualties, organized new recruit training brigades in the Shuihouling area. All able-bodied men over the age of 18 and under the age of 35 were ordered to participate in the training. If they refused, they would be killed. If the person escaped, their entire family would be killed. It is now heard that more than 2,000 people have participated in the training as cannon fodder. They are also conducting the so-called three-capture movement: the first is to capture wealthy households and force them to pay grain and money; the second is to capture young men and women, with the men being recruited to fill vacancies and the women being assigned to comfort squads; and the third is to capture grassroots political personnel to remove obstacles, causing chaos in the local area. Bandit Leader Liu Bocheng is currently stationed at the Zhao Family Garden in Taihu County. Last time, he attempted to cross the Yangtze River in Wangjiang County but was intercepted by our navy artillery. Now he is still ambitious and attempts to secretly cross the river in the Shutung mountainous area, but the river surface is patrolled by the navy, and the army has the National Army to block the attack, which is still a pipe dream.</p>
<h3>Wang Jiefo Tours Again Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Suzhou, 13th] Wu County Magistrate Wang Yi will go to Songnan, Songbei, Yangcheng and other places with Secretary Shen at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning to meet with local military police chiefs, village heads, etc., to supervise the collection of grain and the suppression of bandits.</p>
<h3>To Protect the Families of Soldiers on Expedition, the Ministry of National Defense Orders All Counties to Comply</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper in Changshu, 11th] The county government received an order from the Ministry of National Defense, stating that the families of soldiers currently serving are mostly poor, and their lives are extremely difficult. Not only have they not received maintenance and relief, but they are often subjected to bullying and extortion by the township and village personnel. Even the fields, houses, wives, and daughters are colluded with to be sold, occupied, and insulted, making it impossible for the soldiers to serve in peace, which greatly affects morale. The collection of preferential grains has been previously stipulated that these grains should be distributed during the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and the end of the year. The protection of the marriages of soldiers on expedition has also been relayed to the courts at all levels. The handling of marriage disputes involving soldiers' families should be strictly in accordance with the "Regulations on the Protection of Marriages of Soldiers on Expedition." The exemption of grain accumulation for soldiers' families (those with income below 50 shi), the reduction and exemption of corvée labor and local temporary donations, and the protection of leasehold rights are all clearly stipulated in the preferential treatment regulations. Special orders have been issued to ensure the protection and safety of the lives of soldiers' families.</p>

After completing their matches in Hong Kong, the team arrived at Longhua Airport in this city at 2:30 PM yesterday, having departed from Hong Kong by special plane at 10:00 AM in the morning. Upon disembarking, Miss Ding Ruyu of the overseas Chinese community presented flowers to the team leader. The team leader, Guo Changfu, accepted with a smile. Except for team member Chen Jiashou, who was injured during a match in Bangkok and has returned to Singapore, the team consisted of twenty-three people. Hu Hao of the Xingdao Football Club also arrived in Shanghai on the same plane. The team members were all wearing navy blue suits, looking bright and energetic. After taking a group photo at the airport with the welcoming party, they boarded a bus provided by the Football Committee and went directly to the Paramount Hotel to rest.</p>
<p>The Football Committee had already arranged the team's schedule in Shanghai, but there were slight changes after their arrival yesterday. At the same time, the reception team has also arranged the itinerary for the United Overseas Chinese Team. The first match is scheduled to begin this Saturday and will end on the 25th, with a stay of about two weeks in Shanghai.

<p>Ministry of Education Held Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Compiling and Printing Textbooks for Primary and Secondary Schools; Preliminary Review of Scholarships for Studying in France Completed</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Ministry of Education's meeting on the 13th discussed promoting three matters: improving English teaching in secondary schools; compiling and printing textbooks for primary and secondary schools; and changing the education sections of provincial, county, and city governments to education bureaus.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Ministry of Education convened a selection committee on the 13th for the exchange of ten scholarships for students studying in France, and a preliminary review has been completed.</p>
<h3>Students at Datong and Great China Universities Oppose Strikes</h3>
<p>[Daguang News Agency] At 8:00 PM on the 11th, Dai Li, Chen Zanpei, and several other students from the Economics Society and History Society of Great China University, claiming to be representatives, convened a meeting of some students and proposed an immediate strike to support Yu Zisan, the Zhejiang University student who committed suicide. However, the majority of students present felt that this matter was clearly being manipulated by treacherous elements and rose up in opposition. Seeing that their plan was thwarted, Dai and others turned their anger on Wang Guozhen, a senior student in the History and Society Department, and attacked him with fists and feet. Mr. Wang has since gone missing and has not been found to this day. All the students of Great China University are extremely indignant and have established a support association, preparing to search for Mr. Wang and request that the authorities punish the perpetrators and eradicate the remaining evil elements of the conspiracy.</p>
<p>[Another Report] At 9:00 AM yesterday, eight or nine unidentified youths suddenly arrived at Datong University, posting slogans everywhere and contacting students in various classes to incite a strike. However, most students, mindful of the harm caused by the previous strike being exploited by bandits, were deeply vigilant and realized that the words and actions of the newcomers were the usual tricks of treacherous elements. They rose up and drove the thugs out of the school, tore down various slogans and leaflets, and continued classes as usual.</p>
<h3>Students of Education Department at St. John's University Raise Funds for Ai Qun Charity School</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The "Ai Qun Charity School" founded by students of the Education Department at St. John's University has recently launched a fundraising campaign with a target of 50 million yuan, which has been endorsed by the university. Since its founding last autumn, the school has achieved remarkable results. There are currently more than 200 students, mostly shop apprentices, unemployed children, and workers from the surrounding area who cannot afford tuition, and they are all provided with free education. The 5 million yuan fund previously raised by the school has been exhausted, so it has been decided to launch another fundraising campaign to continue the development of this social education.</p>
<h3>Sidelines of the Municipal Games: Autumn Wind Blows, Cold Deepens; Yellow Sand Rolls, Mustaches and Eyebrows Turn Black</h3>
<p>[Our Report] On the second day of the Games, the autumn wind suddenly turned strong, and the cold deepened in the evening. Most of the athletes were bareheaded and barefoot, shivering from the cold. The audience also retreated, and the atmosphere became quiet and deserted. In the sun-shading yellow sand, the staff members' mustaches and eyebrows turned black, their faces covered in dust.</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a sudden gust of wind swept across the front of the platform, swift and fierce, knocking over the loudspeaker stand. Fortunately, the speaker was not damaged and was still able to command the troops.</p>
<p>The medical staff were quite busy yesterday, treating six athletes, three of whom fainted due to excessive exercise, and the other three of whom suffered from nerve spasms due to the cold weather.</p>
<p>A New Perspective</p>
<p>The students of Xinsheng Elementary School (formerly the Caohejing Children's Home) are particularly admirable. Each of them wore a white T-shirt and a pair of briefs, performing the "Airplane Exercise" in the cold wind, changing formations in countless ways, neither hurried nor slow. Who would have known that these children, who once roamed the streets, would have today's achievements in physique and discipline?</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a young elementary school student named Zha Zhenyuan got lost from his school group on their way back to school and cried incessantly. Later, the Boy Scouts of Xieqiao National School in the Fourth District inquired and sent him home. Doing a good deed every day, acting bravely for a just cause, young people are indeed still lovable.</p>
<p>Quaint and Elegant</p>
<p>The most outstanding group exercise performance was Yisheng Elementary School's Brocade Dance, which was ingenious, beautiful, and unique. Peiben's agricultural dance, performed by both male and female teams, all barefoot and wearing straw sandals, the men wearing straw hats and the women wearing headscarves, was accompanied by violin and drums. The sound and movements were all natural, making it the most classical performance of the day.</p>
<p>The loudspeaker on the platform was the most loyal and busiest worker at the Games, finding people, claiming lost items, issuing commands, and even saying hello, hardly stopping for a minute. Once, a student crossed the track, violating the rules, and the loudspeaker suddenly shouted "Bastard!" causing a shock throughout the venue. Sometimes, when the program was slightly free and the loudspeaker had nothing to do, the faint sound of laughter and chatter could be heard, captivating the audience outside the venue.</p>
<p>The Evening of Transition</p>
<p>The elementary school games ended completely yesterday. Today, the college, high school, and open divisions will officially begin. It is expected that the scene of singing and dancing in the venue will no longer exist, and it will be replaced by tense and intense competition.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, in the fading twilight, the figures in the venue were sparse. On one side, the elementary schools were striking camp and celebrating their victories; on the other side, the middle schools were setting up camp. The grasshopper-style tents gradually decreased, and the Mongolian yurt-style and seven-star tents rose in their place. Therefore, yesterday evening can be called "The Evening of Transition."</p>
<p>The referees for the field events call the "preliminary rounds" "fatigue roll calls" because there are nearly 200 athletes in each event in the preliminary rounds, trying out throws and jumps... Just calling the names is enough to make their mouths dry and their voices hoarse.</p>

<h3>Economic Commission Drafting Specific Plans to Assist in the Export of Materials; Production and Sales If Development is Possible, Import Quotas Can Be Relaxed</h3>
<p>The government regards the export of materials as the source of foreign exchange and has always attached great importance to it. In the past, due to various reasons, the export of materials has not been able to proceed smoothly. Although assisted by foreign exchange policies, the current situation has not yet improved. The difficulties of the export industry have not been resolved. Today, all parties attach importance to the issue of import quotas, but ignore the need to increase exports to seek redress. The current government authorities believe that exports are more important than imports today. If there is a way to export, import quotas can be relaxed. It is learned that the National Economic Commission has begun to draft a specific export plan for exported materials, paying special attention to issues such as the production cost, transportation, and standards of exported materials. As for the use of funds, improvement of technology, supply of raw materials, and smooth transportation, efforts will be made to provide assistance. The Export Promotion Office of the Export Control Commission has provided various data, and it is expected that this plan will be announced in the short term. There will be new developments in exported materials.</p>
<h3>People's Hearts Turn Towards Prosperity, Merchants Scramble to Buy Cotton Yarn and Cloth, Prices Rise Across the Board; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Yarn Soars by Nearly Two Million</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw brisk sales by merchants due to firm prices in various parts of North China. Replica manufacturers in this street feared that the government's unified procurement would delay the allocation procedures, affecting raw materials, so they were actively seeking to stock up, and prices gradually rose. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose by 1.9 million compared to before the holiday, reaching 38.1 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also continued to rise by about 500,000 to 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened flat in the morning. Later, upon hearing of high prices in Tianjin, Hankou, and other places, merchants bought actively. Local traders in this street, seeing the soaring yarn market and feeling a sense of prosperity, saw a sudden surge in market sentiment. Dyeing and weaving factories frequently absorbed medium-grade fine cloth, and external lifting was also strong. Therefore, in the end, the prices of various grades of fine cloth such as 12-pound Dragon Head soared by 55,000 to 60,000 yuan compared to before the holiday. Four Gentlemen and Golden Lotus Serge were actively bought by merchants, and the prices rose by 65,000 to 40,000 yuan. The price of other valley cloth also remained firm.</p>
<p>Cotton is Now Tight</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market advanced rapidly. Small-scale yarn factories absorbed heavily, and traders followed suit, with prices rising gradually. In the afternoon, as cotton yarn closed with a sharp advance, owners raised prices, and demand from households was strong, and spot prices remained firm, resulting in very active trading. Transactions in various grades totaled 1,700 bales and 700 bundles. Factory prices opened at 3.97 million for Lingbao, 4.29 million for Dezi cotton, 4.24 million for 41, and 3.72 million for Hanxi. The warehouse delivery price opened at 4.05 million for 1:32 Terring, 4.14 million for Lingbao, 3.927 million for Zhangde, 3.72 million for Hanxi, and 3.44 million for Qidong, with 850 bales traded, and Zhoupu seed cotton at 40,000.</p>
<h3>The Copying Industry Association Requests to Participate in Cotton Yarn Joint Allocation</h3>
<p>Nine industry associations in this city, including the copying industry, as well as copying industry associations from five counties in other cities - Changshu, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Wuxian, and Changzhou - recently planned for joint yarn allocation, which the government's Yarn Allocation Committee is overseeing. The copying industry had requested to send representatives to participate together, but did not receive permission from the Textile and Silk Association. These industries believe that the purpose of joint yarn allocation is to achieve a balance between supply and demand for both production and sales. The copying industry is the only channel for actual sales of cotton yarn. If they cannot obtain representative participation, then there will still be many obstacles after the allocation is implemented, which is of great importance to the interests of the industry. They have again jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the National Economic Commission, calling on relevant agencies. The following is an excerpt of their reasons:</p>
<p>The actual sales target for the yarn produced by cotton mills is the copying industry. Therefore, joint yarn allocation must be based on the equipment and output of copying production to make regular and quantitative allocations. Only then can the supply and demand of materials move towards the right track. Furthermore, adjustment techniques must also be made public. Therefore, the organization in charge should be jointly participated in by the copying industry.</p>
<p>Yarn price negotiation should also be reasonable. Producers must consider production costs, while users have no other formal supply channels besides allocated yarn. However, in the past, price negotiations were authorized by the Yarn and Silk Association to a price negotiation subcommittee. The price negotiation subcommittee raised prices because the black market was high. Such price negotiations are enough to stimulate people's hearts. In the future, the copying industry should participate in the review.</p>
<p>When the former Textile Control Committee was in charge of distribution, it would convene copying representatives to attend meetings and provide opinions for the decision of important facilities. Now that joint distribution will thoroughly strengthen and stabilize prices, both supply and demand should reach coordination.</p>
<h3>Wool Fabrics Sales Flourish Again</h3>
<p>The wool fabrics market had been sluggish for half a month with weakened trading. Yesterday at the tea party and among the large wholesalers on Chessboard Street, buying and selling became more prosperous again. Seasonable, dark-colored flannels, medium-thick serge, overcoating, M'eltons, riding breeches cloth, cashmere twills, long-pile women's woolens, as well as "Fasi" linings, black carbon linings, shirt linings, and mercerized feather yarn, all saw substantial transactions. Merchants have been adding to their stocks, and both retail and wholesale business has turned lively again. As a result, standard prices have mostly turned from sluggish to stable.</p>
<h3>Sluggish Rice Sales, Both Japonica and Indica Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 18,000 piculs of rice arrived in the North and South markets, with sluggish sales. Although prices were firm inland, due to the surprisingly large arrivals from the Sujia line on the southern route of Shanghai, the market situation plummeted. Early thin rice sharply dropped by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, while Lili Songjiang japonica rice plunged wildly by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Northern japonica rice followed suit and continued to decline by 30,000 yuan. Rice also dropped by 10,000 yuan. White "Yinyuan" followed suit.</p>
<p>Flour prices plummeted by 10,000 yuan due to the sharp drop in rice prices, making people feel uncertain. Although those holding onto bran were firm, actual sales were flat, and prices were squeezed down by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybean cakes, however, moved in Shantou. The factory's current production remained firm. Soybean merchants were still actively buying, but as all goods declined, prices also fell by 10,000 yuan. There was a considerable arrival of "Du" beans, but improvement was still difficult. Prices were cut by 10,000 yuan. Broad beans were unable to rise and were reduced by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Adzuki beans were unmoved in other areas, but prices here continued to fall, with a further drop of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Kidney beans, South Seas selected grades, were slightly active, with high-end goods temporarily flat, but mid-range goods were sluggish and declined by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Cowpeas continued to be taken in Shantou, with high grades stable but secondary grades sluggish, and mid- to low-grades falling back by 10,000 yuan. Red beans also followed suit and fell by 10,000 yuan. Corn from the northern oceans was still falling, with another drop of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sesame was mixed. Black sesame (for oil) was being strongly sought after, with a gradual rise of 10,000 yuan. White sesame was dull. The local market was still sluggish, with a further decline of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Milk sesame was scarce in both supply and demand, with little movement. Raw peanuts were eagerly absorbed by Cantonese merchants, and prices were temporarily stabilized.</p>
<p>The oil market had more supply than demand, and prices fell sharply. Raw oil was extremely sluggish, with a wild drop of 100,000 yuan. Refined oil followed suit with a drop of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Soybean oil was abundant, and prices dropped sharply by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Clear oil also fell by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and sesame oil followed with a decline of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Factories lacked delivery of wheat.</p>
<h3>National Bank Auditing Department Announces September Bank and庄 Deposit Amounts</h3>
<p>The National Bank Auditing Department yesterday (13th) announced the comparative table of the total amount of deposits and reserve funds of each bank and 庄 nationwide in September, as follows: demand deposits were 2,471,789,839,206.66 yuan, time deposits were 367,108,290,506.26 yuan, the total amount of deposits was 2,838,891,129,712.92 yuan, and the paid-in reserve fund was 391,191,214,533.55 yuan.</p>
<h3>Strong Domestic and Foreign Demand for Cotton Cloth, China Trust Currently Exchanges Cotton Yarn for Cloth</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) The Central Trust Bureau is actively handling the export of cotton yarn spun from uncertified foreign cotton. As reported previously in this newspaper, as of yesterday (12th), it had signed contracts to sell a total of 4,200 bales of cotton yarn and over 268,000 bolts of cotton cloth. It is now learned that, at the request of cloth factories, the Bureau will exchange yarn for cloth for export. The exchange rate is approximately one 400-pound bale of 20-count yarn for about 29 bolts of 12-pound fine cloth, each 40 yards long and 36 inches wide. Any cloth factory in this city that has more than 10,000 bolts of 12-pound fine cloth that meet export standards can contact the Bureau's purchasing department for exchange before the end of this month. However, this cloth is exclusively for export. Great importance is attached to quality, and no carelessness is allowed in order to maintain the reputation of domestic products. In addition, the Bureau also has a portion of 32-count and 42-count fine yarn. Part of it has already been exchanged for cotton textiles such as undershirts, handkerchiefs, and shirt poplin for export. There is still a remaining amount. Factories with experience in exporting cotton textiles can also contact the Bureau's purchasing department as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Buying Interest in Chinese Stocks Picks Up, Wing On Shares Break the 300 Barrier</h3>
<p>Although Chinese stocks saw weakness midway through yesterday's trading as yarn and flower merchants closed out their positions, an influx of speculative capital from the northern districts and a rally cry from the northern merchants caused material prices to surge. The afternoon market was further boosted by "cha-chu" (a type of speculative trading), and the market closed in a fiery mood.</p>
<p>In the morning, Wing On shares rose due to reports that US loans would be implemented in installments. Opening at 288 yuan and 297 yuan respectively, they rose to high prices of 292 yuan for immediate delivery and 302 yuan for deferred delivery. Subsequently, the offloading of cash Wing On shares and the selling of deferred delivery shares caused prices to retreat to 283 yuan and 292 yuan respectively. The off-market interest rate opened slightly higher at 16.5 fen and 21 fen. Afterwards, there was a slight rebound, but the force of selling cash Wing On shares to close immediate delivery positions forced prices down to lows of 279 yuan for immediate delivery and 286 yuan for deferred delivery at 11:40 AM. The afternoon close was still raised to 288 yuan and 296 yuan. As a result, compared to the pre-close prices, immediate delivery shares of Wing On, Wah Shing, Great Communication, Hsin Yee slightly rose, while Zhabei, Tong Yee, Mei Ya, China Silk, Matches, New Light, King Lun, Wing Kong, King Fook, New Asia, Underwear, Wah Fung, and Sino-French slightly declined, while Keen Hing, Lai On, China Textile, and Rong Fung were flat. Deferred delivery shares saw slight gains for New Light and King Fook, and Keen Hing, while Wah Fung was flat. Wing On, Hsin Ho, and Mei Ya rose by 0.5%.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, prices were stable due to signs of activity in material prices. Wing On shares rose to 298 yuan for immediate delivery and 306 yuan for deferred delivery. Finally, with the exchange of "cha-chu" and news that Nanjing merchants were forcefully buying 200 million shares off-market, sentiment was boosted and prices broke through the 300 yuan barrier, reaching highs of 305 yuan and 313 yuan, before closing at 304 yuan and 313 yuan respectively. As a result, compared to the morning close, immediate delivery shares of Wing On, Wah Shing, Hsin Ho, New Light, Wah Fung, Sino-French, and Zhabei each rose by 0.5%, while Lai On and Hsin Yee were flat, and the rest rose slightly. For deferred delivery shares, New Light and Keen Hing rose slightly, while the rest all rose by 0.5%. Off-market, old shares and utility shares were slightly lower, while bank shares rose another 0.5%, and the rest remained stable.</p>
<p>Another report: The premium for cash-deferred arbitrage was slightly higher than the previous session, but bank positions still exceeded long positions. Wing On retreated from 9.5 yuan to 8.2 yuan, Mei Ya retreated from 13 yuan to 12 yuan, Hsin Ho fell from 5 yuan to 4 yuan, New Light was around 1 yuan, and Wah Fung was about 2 yuan and change. Those offering premiums were from 10.5 fen to 13.5 fen, and those requesting premiums were from 13.5 fen to 16.5 fen.</p>
<p>The Direct Tax Bureau sent a letter to the Stockbrokers Association, stating, "Stamp tax is a tax on certificates and is different in nature from transaction tax. There is no double taxation. Please instruct all brokers to affix stamp tax stamps in accordance with Article 16, Item 10 of the Stamp Tax Law."</p>
<p>New China Department Store has completed its increased production and resumed trading, with 100,000 shares traded.</p>
<h3>United Bonds Slightly Weak, Foreign Stocks Rise</h3>
<p>Government bonds saw weakness yesterday. United Bonds (丙) opened at 22,500 yuan, with a high of 22,800 yuan and a low of 20,600 yuan, before stabilizing slightly. United Bonds (丙) fell by 2,700 compared to the pre-close price, while other bonds fell by 1,900. Approximately 5 million changed hands.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were stable in the morning and firm at noon yesterday. External stimulus increased, with Cantonese and Securities merchants both entering the market. Foreign firms sold slightly. The steel industry had special news of excellent dividend payments and was uniquely strong, rising by 20%. Jardine Beers also continued to be strong. Jardine Textiles opened at 202,000 yuan and rose to a new high price of 220,000 yuan by the end of the afternoon. As a result, compared to the pre-close prices, the steel industry rose by over 20%, shipping rose by 10%, plantations fell by 0.5%, and Jardine Textiles, British, Deutz Fahr, Jardine Beverages, and Kwong Paper each rose by 0.5%.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Reaches New High Prices Due to Suspension of Allocation News</h3>
<p>The artificial silk market yesterday was stimulated by the news of the temporary suspension of allocation, which inevitably led to opportunistic price increases. 120 denier "Xu" brand luster opened as high as 92 million yuan. Although trading was quiet, holders were unwilling to sell, so the midday close rose by 3 million yuan. The afternoon continued to rise, with a final selling price of 5 million yuan. 4A Toray was 86 million yuan in the morning and 88 million yuan in the afternoon, 5 million yuan higher than Tuesday.</p>
<p>Factory Made Rayon</p>
<p>The market yesterday was prosperous due to the high rise of artificial silk. CD grade was quoted at around 67 to 68 million yuan, with all grades quoted up 2 million yuan compared to Tuesday. High grade "Ling Zu" was traded at 66 million yuan, up 1.5 million yuan. Although the transaction of dried rayon was rare, the market also brought up about 2 million yuan yesterday.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for silk quilts and silk bedding saw Huaqiang and Dacheng goods opening at 3.7 million for immediate delivery and 850,000 for deferred delivery. However, due to the strength of the shorts, there were continuous sell-offs, and the price fell to a minimum of 550,000 yuan for immediate delivery. The longs took advantage of the low prices to absorb them, and then they went up again. The maximum deferred delivery date reached 4.15 million yuan, and the closing price was 850,000 yuan for immediate delivery and 4 million yuan for deferred delivery. In the afternoon, the market was even more prosperous due to high raw material prices, and off-market transactions were at 4.5 million yuan. Mei Ya goods were 200,000 yuan higher than Dacheng. Other goods, factory made rayon, have been slightly increased due to cost reasons, but actual sales were flat, and transactions were not lively.</p>
<h3>Returned Checks Gradually Decreasing</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Returned checks from various banks and 庄s in this city have gradually decreased after strict crackdowns by the Central Bank and the Financial and Economic Standing Bureau. Yesterday, according to the Central Bank, there were 4,853 returned checks on the 3rd of this month, 2,801 on the 4th, 3,145 on the 5th, 2,368 on the 6th, 2,166 on the 7th, and 2,454 on the 8th. The total amount of returned checks in one week was 135,715,240 yuan, accounting for only a little less than 0.5% of the total amount of exchanges.</p>
<h3>Banks and Bureaus Clearing 44.3 Billion</h3>
<p>(Report from this newspaper) Interbank lending was relatively stable yesterday. The positions of various banks and Zhuang were uneven. The National Bank cleared 39.5 billion, the Four Banks and Two Bureaus cleared 44.3 billion, the large clearing banks and Zhuang cleared 72.9 billion, the foreign merchant banks cleared 23.4 billion, the small clearing banks and Zhuang cleared 52 billion, the Bank of China cleared 33.6 billion, the Bank of Communications cleared 30.6 billion, the Agricultural Bank of China cleared 5.2 billion, the Central Trust Bureau cleared 7.8 billion, the Frontier Exchange Bureau cleared 4.5 billion, and the Cooperative Treasury cleared 41.2 billion.</p>
<h3>Sugar Continues to be Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan due to the Taiwan currency exchange rate rising by four yuan. The Association's pricing was 1,001,500 yuan to 1 million yuan for 24-piece white sugar, 1,030,000 yuan for large-package dry spot sugar, 920,000 yuan for spot No. 2 medium sand white sugar, 1,050,000 yuan for Taiwan red sugar, 830,000 yuan for Shantou green sugar, and 810,000 yuan to 800,000 yuan for secondary grades. Xinghua white bag Zhuang was 980,000 yuan to 950,000 yuan for good quality goods, 930,000 yuan for Lou Zhuang, and 870,000 to 880,000 yuan for Xing red sugar. The first batch of new Shunde green sugar opened at 830,000 yuan, and old goods were at 790,000 yuan. Scattered lots of "Diao" green sugar opened at 800,000 yuan, with over 600 pieces opened in total.</p>
<p>Tea Market Quiet</p>
<p>The foreign tea market, which has been silent for a long time, still showed no signs of a turnaround yesterday. The reason is that exporters are stingy with their bids, while sellers are not giving in at all, forming a divergence in negotiations. For domestic tea, the supply in the market is dwindling. Although buying interest is good in the local shops and Zhuang, transactions are always in a narrow path, but the potential is quite sharp.</p>

<p>Telecommunications Special Issue</p>
<h3>Before and After the War—A Comparison of Engineering at the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau</h3>
<p>— Zhao Li</p>
<p>Telecommunications connect across vast distances in an instant, whether during war or peacetime, as tools for military or commercial battles, their importance cannot be overstated. Shanghai is the center of national politics and economics, and telecommunications need to be connected to large and small cities and towns across the country. One can imagine the importance of its performance and the busyness of its work. Here is a brief comparison of the engineering work of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau before and after the war, which I believe will be welcomed by those concerned about telecommunications administration.</p>
<p>(A) Local Telephone</p>
<p>The total number of telephone users in Shanghai is about 70,000, ranking first among major cities in the country. However, most users are concentrated in the old concession areas, and those in the Hongkou and Nanshi areas account for less than one-tenth of the total number of users. Due to the division of the administrative system in the above two areas at the time of establishment, the management and mechanical programs of local telephones are also different. The former was operated by the American Shanghai Telephone Company, and the machinery was rotary. The latter was operated by the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications of our country, and the machinery was step-by-step. The connection between the two areas is established through relay lines. In the early days of the War of Resistance, Shanghai fell. Both the American Telephone Company and the Changhua Bureau were forcibly occupied by the Japanese. In the autumn of the year before last, Shanghai was restored. Our government, in order to take into account the interests of allied nations, returned the local telephones in the old concession area to the American company for operation. As for the local telephones in Zhabei and Nanshi under the jurisdiction of the former Telephone Bureau, they were merged with the telegraph business to form a Telecommunications Bureau in charge.</p>
<p>The city of Shanghai is vast. In addition to urban telephones, suburban telephones have also been developed at the same time. Taking urban telephones as the core, a telephone network is formed. Therefore, the current affiliated institutions of the local telephone under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau include the Hongkou Nanshi Pudong three telephone exchanges and the downtown Wusong Zhenru Longhua Fuxing Island each branch exchange. The installed machine cities are divided into automatic, common battery and magnet types. The mechanical capacity and procedures before and after the war are compared in the table below:</p>
<p>About 2,000 local telephone lines were destroyed during the war. In the past two years after the war, efforts have been made to restore and expand them in response to social needs. However, due to the lack of construction funds, communication equipment, and technical personnel, it is obviously impossible to achieve large-scale expansion in a short period of time. Therefore, the increase in new users must be restricted at present.</p>
<p>(B) Long-Distance Telephone</p>
<p>Long-distance telephones are divided into wired and wireless. Although the engineering equipment is different, the call efficiency is the same. For shorter distances, the cost of setting up poles and wires is not significant, so most calls use wired lines. For longer distances, wireless terminals are used instead of poles and wires, which is more economical and suitable for materials and maintenance. Therefore, wireless calls are more suitable. My country's long-distance telephone business was in its initial stage before the war, and the equipment was simple. The long-distance call mechanical equipment of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau only had six switchboard seats, two recording seats, and two single-channel carrier telephone terminals. After the war, Shanghai's telephone users needed long-distance telephones very eagerly, which can be seen from the busy call situation. Therefore, the machine line equipment has been gradually increased in the past two years to meet the needs; the long-distance wired telephone and wireless telephone engineering equipment are described separately below:</p>
<p>1. Wired Telephone - There are currently eighteen long-distance switchboard seats, six long-distance recording seats, thirty-three wave telephone circuits, twelve copper live lines, and twelve iron telephone lines. Work is done day and night, and a 24-hour call system is implemented for users. As for the distribution of long-distance telephone lines, Shanghai is the core, and its branching can be divided into three: (A) Near-Distance Telephone Network - The near distance of Shanghai is within 100 kilometers. Each city and town area has twelve pairs of 4.5 mm iron telephone lines, which are connected to form a telephone network, reaching Jiading, Taicang, Songjiang, Qingpu, Baoshan, Chuansha, Minhang and other places. (B) South Branch Telephone Network - From Shanghai southward to Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Zhaoxian and other places, the distance is long, and there is much call attenuation, so copper telephone lines are set up instead of iron telephone lines. Also, due to busy calls, the actual number of lines does not match the allocation, so carrier equipment is added to complete the call mission. The current equipment includes three pairs of 2.9 mm copper telephone lines and eight carrier telephone circuits. (C) West Branch Telephone Network - From Shanghai westward through Kunshan, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang to Nanjing, three copper telephone lines of 3.5 mm diameter are set up. There are two pairs of them, and eight pairs of 2.9 mm diameter. Also, each bureau is equipped with a carrier machine to facilitate calls. There are currently a total of 25 carrier telephone circuits.</p>
<p>2. Wireless Telephone - Wireless telephone equipment can be divided into the following three categories: (A) Three short-wave telephone transmitters for domestic calls, installed at Zhenru Nanxiang Jianguo West Road three transmitting stations. The one installed at Zhenru is a kilowatt machine, reaching Chongqing, Beijing, Tianjin and Hankou. Those installed in Nanxiang and Jianguo West Road are both six-watt machines, reaching Jinan, Qingdao, Guangzhou and Taipei. As for the three receiving machines, they are installed at Liuhang receiving station. There are also three terminals, all installed in the Xubangqiao Bureau Building. (B) Two ultra-shortwave 50-watt transceivers for short-distance difficult calls, installed at the Hengbangqiao Bureau, respectively communicating with Nanjing and Yin County. The machine has a wavelength of four meters and a call distance of about 25 to 50 miles. If the call distance exceeds the above distance, a relay station is set up to assist. Therefore, there are four relay stations between Shanghai and Nanjing in Kunshan, Wuxi, Benniu and Zhenjiang. There is a relay station in Zhangdun between Shanghai and Yin County to complete the call mission. (C) One 2-kilowatt dual-channel single-sideband wireless telephone machine for international calls. The machine can provide two pairs of users to call at the same time. Its transponder is located in Zhenru, the receiver is located in Liuhang, and the terminal is located next to the long-distance station in Yokohama Bridge for easy transfer. The terminal is equipped with security equipment (Split Band Priacy System) to cut the user's voice frequency into several segments, and each segment is frequency-modulated with a different frequency. The frequency-modulated frequency changes every 20 seconds. Therefore, if the same terminal machine is not used to restore it, the user's conversation cannot be heard by others, which is much better than the previous standard three thousand cycle anti-sound security. It is the most modern and economical wireless telephone equipment. It is currently communicating with San Francisco and has been smooth and excellent.</p>
<p>(C) Wired Telegraph and Wireless Telegraph</p>
<p>Before the war, wired telegraph equipment was more developed than wireless. Wired telegraph has a long history. Although it is not as convenient and economical as wireless telegraph in application, in my country's poor economic situation, it is not allowed to abandon the original wired equipment and switch to new wireless equipment due to economic capabilities. The environment is different after reconstruction after the war. It is more appropriate to purchase effective and lightweight wireless transceivers with the same amount of money than to purchase outdated wired telegraph machines. Therefore, at present, the wired telegraph office does not use the machinery damaged or outdated during the war, and replaces it with the latest type of teletype machine. Comparing the number of telegraph machines, there were more before the war than after the war, but in terms of performance and efficiency, the post-war period is certainly better than the pre-war period. As for the comparison of wireless equipment, both the quantity and power are stronger after the war than before the war. The following table shows the comparison separately:</p>
<p>(D) Recent Developments</p>
<p>The current telephone and telegraph equipment is still insufficient for application, especially local telephones. If there is no large-scale expansion, it will not be enough to meet the requirements of all sectors. However, in this period of suppressing rebellion and building the country, the funding is extremely detailed, and it is particularly difficult to apply for foreign exchange. Therefore, the engineering equipment can only be gradually expanded. The following items are currently in progress and planned: (A) Hongkou Exchange added 500 automatic switchboards, 9 domestic long-distance stations, and 14 international technical stations. (B) The relay cables between the Hongkou and Nanshi exchanges and the Shanghai Telephone Company are respectively equipped with one 100-pair and 200-pair armored cable. (C) The new Qibao receiving station centralizes the receiving machine for unified management. (D) Expand the Nanxiang transmitting station, add two second-class transmitters, and add a telegraph machine room. (E) Install the telex central receiving and reporting office and automatic reporting equipment. (F) Increase telex teletypewriters. (G) Add remote control cable from the central office to each radio station. (H) The four-type vacuum tubes of each transmitter are changed to American vacuum tubes. (I) Shanghai and Tianjin wirelessly test the direct reception and transmission of telex teletypewriters.</p>

<h3>Common Sense of Telecommunications: Lecture 3 - How to Use Special Services</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jiayu</p>
<p>1. Proofreading (Identifier TC) Generally speaking, with the gradual improvement of telecommunications machinery, the possibility of transmission errors has been reduced to a minimum. However, on the other hand, due to the overly complex structure of Chinese characters, even though the Chinese telecommunications industry has evolved for more than sixty years, up to now, all Chinese telegrams, which account for more than 90% of all incoming and outgoing telegrams, still have to use four-digit code translation for transmission. Therefore, if even one digit is translated or transmitted incorrectly, it will result in a huge discrepancy. For example, the code for the character "十" (ten) in "十牛" (ten oxen) is "0577," while the code for the character "千" (thousand) is "0578." Older telegraph operators with more experience were very familiar with code translation, and even if there were errors, it was not difficult to immediately check and correct them. However, in recent years, telecommunications knowledge has been advancing rapidly, and the knowledge and skills that employees must learn are very extensive. Apart from code translation personnel who specialize in code translation, general telegraph operators cannot afford to spend too much effort memorizing code translation. At the same time, modern high-speed automatic telegraph transmitters transmit telegrams at a rate more than ten times higher than manual machines. During the transmission process, it is impossible to read each character carefully. Due to these factors, errors in telegram transmission are still difficult to avoid absolutely in practice. In response to the above shortcomings, the telegraph office has recently resumed the practice of translating and sending incoming telegrams. If there are very obvious errors in the telegram text, they can be checked and corrected immediately before translation and sending. However, it is not easy to spot errors in Chinese and foreign ciphertext telegrams, as well as Arabic numerals written in parentheses in plaintext telegrams. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of telegrams, the words "校對" (proofreading) (or the TC identifier) can be added to the beginning of the telegram. The receiving telegraph office should, after copying the telegram, send it back to the sending telegraph office once for verification against the original.</p>
<p>For telegrams reporting market quotations in the industrial and commercial sectors, it is best to use the proofreading method as much as possible. For example, suppose a yarn firm in Tianjin intends to entrust a broker at the Shanghai Yarn Exchange to buy cotton yarn on its behalf. It has previously sent a telegram notifying the broker to buy ten bales of 42-count Blue Phoenix brand cotton yarn when the price falls to 25 million yuan per bale. However, due to carelessness during transmission, the price of 25 million was mistakenly transmitted as 26 million, causing the broker to buy on behalf of the firm when the price fell to 26 million yuan per bale. Shortly afterward, the market price continued to fall to 25 million yuan or even below 25 million yuan per bale. Only when the broker and the client settled the account did they realize that the incorrect transmission had resulted in an unexpected loss. The telegraph office is only responsible for refunding the telegraph fee according to the regulations and is not liable for any other compensation. If the sender had used the proofreading method when sending the telegram, this kind of error would not have occurred.</p>
<p>Having said that, the telegraph office is now making every effort to ensure the accuracy of telegram transmission. All important numbers written in parentheses in the telegram text are now required to be retransmitted once for verification. However, for the sake of the sender, the fee for using the proofreading special service is only half the price of an ordinary telegram (assuming the ordinary telegraph fee is 1,000 yuan per word, then regardless of whether the original telegram is express, urgent, or ordinary, the additional proofreading fee should be 500 yuan per word). The cost is small, but it has a great effect on improving the accuracy of telegrams. Why not do it?</p>
<p>2. Prepaid Reply Fee of Several Yuan (Identifier RP...) Telegrams using the special service of prepaid reply fees are equivalent to letters with return postage stamps attached. Suppose a certain Mr. Jia living in Hankou prepares to entrust a certain Mr. Yi living in Shanghai to inquire about the market price of a certain commodity in Shanghai and hopes that Mr. Yi will reply by telegram. However, Mr. Jia and Mr. Yi have rarely had economic dealings in the past, and according to the regulations, the telegraph fee for sending telegrams must be paid by the sender. In order not to make Mr. Yi bear the telegraph fee for sending a reply, Mr. Jia can indicate "预付回电费若干元" (prepaid reply fee of several yuan) or "RP... (yuan)" identifier at the beginning of the telegram and pay the Hankou telegraph office the approximate amount of the reply telegram fee from Shanghai to Hankou, along with the telegraph fee for his own telegram to Mr. Yi in Shanghai.</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram from Hankou with the "预付回电费若干元" (prepaid reply fee of several yuan) identifier, the Shanghai telegraph office will immediately issue a prepaid reply fee voucher indicating the value, seal it in the telegram, and send it to Mr. Yi. Within three months from the date of receiving this voucher, Mr. Yi can use the voucher to send a telegram to the telegraph office at the same price as the value stated on the voucher, without additional charges. However, if the reply telegram fee exceeds the amount of the prepaid reply fee, the excess amount should be paid by Mr. Yi. If the reply telegram fee is lower than the amount of the prepaid reply fee, the remaining amount will be refunded by the Hankou telegraph office to Mr. Jia (the original sender) upon request by Mr. Jia (the sender) or Mr. Yi (the recipient). Furthermore, Mr. Yi's use of the voucher to send a reply telegram is not limited to sending it to the original sender who paid the prepaid reply fee. In other words, Mr. Yi can also use the prepaid reply fee paid by Mr. Jia to send a telegram to anyone living in any place within the country where telegram service is available.</p>
<p>If Mr. Yi receives a telegram from Mr. Jia with a prepaid reply fee but does not want to accept Mr. Jia's prepaid reply fee out of friendship, and voluntarily pays the fee to send a reply telegram, or does not want to accept Mr. Jia's entrustment at all, he can return the prepaid reply fee voucher to the telegraph office within three months of receiving it and request notification to the original sending office to refund the full amount of the reply fee to Mr. Jia.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Emerging Businesses: What is a Night Letter Telegram?</h3>
<p>— Tao Yong</p>
<p>The origin of night letter telegrams: "Night letter telegrams" were originally a type of letter telegram, facilitating the sending of telegrams with longer texts. They have been available in Europe and the United States for a long time. Although some people in China have advocated for them earlier, they were delayed in implementation due to insufficient cost-effectiveness and difficulties in operation. Recently, the Telecommunications Administration is actively promoting the business and resolutely ignoring all kinds of difficulties in equipment, economy, and personnel, opening night letter telegrams to facilitate the public. This is worth introducing.</p>
<p>Features and advantages: Night letter telegrams are similar in nature to reduced-price calls at night; because the telegraph office is busy during the day, it uses the relatively quiet opportunity at night to deliver them later. In other words, it will be transmitted after ordinary telegrams. But its price is half the price of an ordinary telegram. In order to save money, a telegram with more words can be sent as a night letter telegram.</p>
<p>Delivery time: According to regulations, if the receiving office receives it during the day, it should be delivered on the same evening (after 7:00 PM); if it is delivered to the receiving office at [some undefined] time, it will be delivered at any time.</p>
<p>Billing and word count: Night letter telegrams can only be limited to Chinese or English plaintext. Each telegram is calculated based on a minimum of 25 words. That is, even if it is less than 25 words, it is also calculated as 25 words. After this, the fee is calculated by the word. The Chinese night letter telegram fee is 500 yuan per word, and the English fee is 1,000 yuan per word, which is equal to half the price of an ordinary telegram. The code translation fee is still the ordinary price of 100 yuan per word.</p>
<p>Payment identification: This type of telegram should indicate "夜信" (night letter) or the English "NLIT" at the beginning of the telegram (that is, before the recipient's name and address) as payment identification. Both are charged as one word.</p>
<p>Applicable special services: Night letter telegrams can also be used with special services such as "prepaid reply fee," "multiple delivery," and "notification of delivery." However, the Chinese "prepaid reply fee" must not be less than 12,500 yuan, and the English must not be less than 25,000 yuan. The "copying fee" is charged according to the ordinary telegram copying fee. "Notification of delivery" adds 12 words of telegram fee to the night letter telegram fee (that is, 6,000 yuan for Chinese and 12,000 yuan for English). "Notification of delivery by letter" adds the postage of a registered letter.</p>
<p>How to use it: If we send a telegram and the number of words is too many, it is very uneconomical. If this telegram does not have anything urgent, we may wish to use a night letter telegram. In terms of time, if the time of sending is in the afternoon or evening, then using a night letter telegram is not slow, and the cost is half of an ordinary telegram. Why not do it if it's not urgent?</p>
<p>Opening locations: Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Dihua, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, Guilin, Changsha, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Luoyang, Qingdao, Zhengzhou, [some undefined], Changchun, Taipei, Kaifeng, Wuxi Zhenjiang, Wuxian, Yongjia, [some undefined], Xuzhou, Wuhu, Hefei, [some undefined], Yichang, Hengyang, Jiujiang, Ji'an, Wanxian, Yibin, [some undefined] county, Hechuan, Neijiang, Guangyuan, Shaoguan, Shantou, Xiamen, Tangshan, Xifengning [some undefined], etc. 50 places.</p>

<h3>Red Leaves</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>Travels of Lao Can "All the way autumn mountains red leaves, old [some undefined] yellow flowers," now is the time [some undefined]. After visiting the Chrysanthemum Exhibition of the Republic of Revival, I can't help but quickly think of red leaves.</p>
<p>The earliest user of the words "red leaves" should be "red leaves poem", Qing Suo Gao Yi said: "During the Tang Chuanzong, Yu You picked up a leaf in the imperial ditch, with a poem on it, You also wrote a poem on the discarded one, placed it on the upper reaches of the ditch, (whether it can be upstream, I will [some undefined] it) The rich Han Madam picked it up, and later, the emperor released the palace maidens, Han married You into etiquette, each took red leaves from [some undefined] to show each other, saying: "Thank you for the matchmaking". Han said "Fang knows red leaves are good matchmakers". Yunxi Yuyi also said that in the Xuanzong Dynasty, there was a story of writing red leaves and flowing with the stream, which can be seen in the Ciyuan "red leaves poem" item. According to Xizong is the grandson of Xuanzhong, (Xuanzong passed on to Zong [some undefined] Zong passed on to [some undefined] Zong) that is, this matter has been flattened in Xuanzong's time, but at that time, because there were no poems circulated, the story was not [some undefined]. In short, the source of the words "red leaves" is guided by Du Mu's poem "box leaves are redder than February flowers", Mu's mountain poem said: "Far up the cold mountain stone path is inclined, white clouds deep where there is a home; stop the car and sit to love the maple forest Xiao, frost leaves redder than February flowers". After that, "red leaves" appeared in the song [some undefined], that is [some undefined] is not uncommon. But the most thought-provoking person who chants "red leaves" is Cui Shousheng of the Qing Dynasty. Cui has a "Like a Dream" word that says: "For the love of the late scenery of Wujiang, the ferry is reflected by the setting sun; the water is like peach blossoms, countless swimming fish mistaken. The wind is still, the wind is still, the same fallen red is piled on the path".</p>

<h3>Phibun and Siam</h3>
<p>— Zheng Fan</p>
<p>A coup d'état took place in Siam on the 9th. The rebel army led by Phibun controlled the Siamese government in an instant, then amended the constitution and reorganized the cabinet. They completely achieved the goal of seizing power without bloodshed.</p>
<p>No matter how long this new government can last, one fact is very clear: Phibun is red again. Although he knows that he does not conform to international sentiment, he did not participate in actual government affairs in the new cabinet, but he is obviously the behind-the-scenes power that controls the entire Siam.</p>
<p>Who exactly is the Phibun who instigated this coup?</p>
<p>We should not forget! Siam's style in this war was like Hungary in Europe. It participated in the "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" and declared war on the Allied countries against its own strength. The then Prime Minister of Siam (the face of going to Japan to meet Tojo is still in front of me,) was Marshal Phibun today.</p>
<p>We will not forget either: For more than ten years, the three million Chinese compatriots who lived in Luo suffered countless cruel discriminations, humiliations, and even massacres. The head of the leaders who presided over and implemented these anti-Chinese policies was also Marshal Phibun.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the essence of the new Siamese government after this coup is not difficult to imagine. The future trend of Luo is indeed worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Seizing power by armed rebellion was originally Phibun's specialty. The famous Cheng Luo coup in 1932 was his first shot. The "Siamese Military Power Group" led by Phibun "revolved" the Siam ruled by monarchs and nobles, and he himself seized the harvest of the great change, colluding with a part of the feudal forces to consolidate his rule; on the one hand, he used the most blatant means to plunder and destroy the industrial and commercial enterprises of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>In this way, he drove out the Seventh Emperor and dragged in a little baby in his teens, and honored him as the Eighth Emperor. This Eighth Emperor has always lived in Switzerland, and he has never even heard of the things of Luo, and even if he heard of it, the teenager in his teens would hardly be able to ask. All state affairs had to be entrusted to Phibun to take care of. Therefore, after a period of dishonorable "internal [some undefined] Qing", Phibun concurrently served as Prime Minister and handled seven important positions including internal affairs, foreign affairs, and military affairs. The puppet show he made was thus successfully completed.</p>
<p>Phibun's character can be included in the three words "arrogant", "stubborn" and "competitive". He graduated from the German military academy and extremely admired the style of the German National Socialist Party. Therefore, the most proud masterpiece after he took office was the so-called "nationalism", that is, the so-called Greater Thai nationalism. Obviously, this was learned from Germany's Greater Germanicism. Its actual content includes dictatorship, militarism, and xenophobia (in fact, there is nothing else to exclude, only anti-Chinese), that is, Hitler-style reckless and crazy madness.</p>
<p>His policy is pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese. He wanted to use his "ally" Japan as a shield to threaten Annam and the United Kingdom and the United States. On the other hand, he wanted to maintain neutrality to coerce Japan, hoping to fish in troubled waters. He dreamed of controlling Annam, and in the name of the Greater Thai, he wanted to extend the northern border of Siam to the Yangtze River in our country. He insisted on his dream and did not hesitate to be humble and to please Japan in every possible way. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Siam's value suddenly doubled, and Phibun was naturally very proud. He finally became a vassal of the "ally" Japan, and actually declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States in order to "build Greater East Asia". Unfortunately, Phibun's wishful thinking did not work out. Japan surrendered, Phibun's good dream was over, and he was once detained as a "Siamese traitor" for some time.</p>
<p>Siam is naturally not without people who love democracy and peace. Although under Phibun's dictatorial regime, anti-dictatorial waves are often launched. Therefore, Phibun suffered two bullets in 1935. He did not die. Immediately, fifty officers were sentenced to death by him; in 1938, he was assassinated for the second time. Poison was pre-set in the night meal, and he did not die again. Seventeen officials were immediately imprisoned by him. Phibun's poisonous methods of dealing with political enemies have long been "thundering" internationally.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about some of Phibun’s “virtuous governance” against overseas Chinese! Under “nationalism”, the suffering of overseas Chinese is indescribable. The property of overseas Chinese may be “nationalized” at any time, and the reading of the motherland’s text in overseas Chinese schools is unreasonably restricted. Phibun often instructed his subordinates to set fires and looting in overseas Chinese concentrated areas; overseas Chinese newspapers did not dare to speak except to act as a mouthpiece for Phibun. News reporters were in danger of being assassinated at any time, and Mr. [some undefined] Guangyan was one of them.</p>
<h3>Pointing Cherries</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>The defendant nicknamed "Hercules" in the Qiu Lian [some undefined] case called the judge "brother" during the court hearing - see the November 6th issue of this newspaper.</p>

<p>The music of "Auspicious People Have God's Help", written by Zhu Manhua, has created a unique style, which is a gratifying achievement. Its tenor is guest-starred by Huang Yuanyin. Huang Yuanyin has won praise [some undefined] abroad, and his songs make it a lot of color. The former soprano was played by a Miss Zu who was very well-versed in orchestral music. The several sections sung by Lin Bin can represent her beautiful melody. Yang Jiaren. Huang Yijun is responsible for the creation of the entire musical effect, plus He Tongxin's directorial technique, which adds a lot of new atmosphere and new charm.</p>

<h3>Two Terrifying Islands</h3>
<p>— Broken Wheel</p>
<p>There are two terrifying islands in the world, which are simply living hells on earth; because both islands are used to imprison prisoners. One is in France, called Devil's Island; the other is in Taiwan, called Green Island.</p>
<p>Devil Bird is a famous place in France for imprisoning prisoners. It was established in 1852 and has a history of one hundred years. The island is surrounded by fierce sharks, dangerous quicksand and wild animals, and there are almost no traces of humans; therefore, prisoners have no way to escape. The life that these prisoners live is like a devil. Therefore, only one-tenth of the prisoners sent there live to five years. According to statistics, the island has imprisoned more than 70,000 prisoners. The prisoners have to work and live by farming; work is rewarded, two francs a day, and you can get forty francs of tickets at the end of the month. The houses are built and repaired by the prisoners themselves, with the words "Salvation Army House" and "House of Hope" written on them, because the manager is always a Salvation Army officer "Charles Bin". He was sent to work on the island after the First World War. But it was not until 1946 that the French authorities cancelled it.</p>
<p>Green Island is in the Pacific Ocean east of the main island of Taiwan, 18 miles from Taitung. Anyone in Taiwan who was deemed by the Japanese to be hindering his rule was sent to this isolated island to be punished for hard labor and never released until death. The island also has a simple prison; prisoners who have just arrived are imprisoned, and shackles can be removed during the day after two or three years of opening. The prison is surrounded by electric nets to prevent escape and rebellion. On the beach, ships are not allowed to dock or approach the island, and prisoners are not allowed to approach the beach, otherwise they will be shot to death.</p>
<p>After our country received Taiwan, this island was liberated, and all mortals were released. Now it has become a deserted island with no human habitation.</p>
<h3>Bernath Reveals: Secrets of the Big Four Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>This news came at night. It was not until the next morning that I visited the President and me. I immediately went to the White House, and the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Army arrived soon after. Admiral Leehe advocated accepting Japan's proposal immediately. I said to the President that I would consider it again before answering this document.</p>
<p>I said: "Why should we retreat from the demand for unconditional surrender? This was proposed before the atomic bomb was dropped and the Soviet Union joined the war. If any conditions are to be accepted, they should be put forward by the United States, not Japan." The President agreed with my view and ordered me to draft a reply. The article includes three main points: Since the surrender, the authority of the Emperor and the Japanese Imperial Government to rule the country shall be placed under the Supreme Commander of the United Nations. The Japanese government and the Japanese Imperial General Staff shall order and ensure that they sign the surrender conditions in order to fulfill the Potsdam Declaration. And immediately ordered the Japanese army to stop fighting. According to the Potsdam Declaration, a government of free will of the Japanese people was established before and after.</p>
<p>This reply document was sent out on August 11. I firmly believed that Japan would be able to accept it. It was not until 4:00 pm on the 14th that we received a call from our Ambassador to Switzerland, Ha Zhicheng, informing me of the content of the Japanese [some undefined] Wen. I ordered the Ministry of Land to connect the wireless circuits of London, Moscow and Chongqing, and inform the foreign ministers of the three countries of Harryson's news. At half past five, I reported the process of the conversation to the President, and all measures were approved. At six o'clock, Mr. Grassley, the diplomatic representative of the Swiss Embassy, ​​visited and read the Japanese document to me. An hour later, President Truman announced to the world the result of this most terrible war.</p>
<p>Everything before Japan's surrender will be recorded in detail in the future. According to inquiries from senior Japanese officials and the public documents obtained, Japan knew nothing about Stalin's intentions five weeks before the surrender. It was not until July 6, 1945, when Chinese Foreign Minister Song Ziwen arrived at the Grassco, that the Japanese suspected the Soviet Union's intentions. At that time, Foreign Minister Tojo said: "We know that Mr. Song received an excellent reception in Moscow and had discussions with Stalin...maybe some treaty will be concluded. It can be seen that even at that time, the efficiency of Japan's intelligence work was not strong. (The full translation will be published soon, reservations or Shen Bao)</p>
