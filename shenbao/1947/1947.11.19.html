<h3>政院通過剿匪方案　自崇禧日內赴九江巡視國防部要員昨先飛抵潯</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕六省聯防會議索決定之剿匪方案，已於十八日提出行政院會議，經二小時之愼重討論後，略作修正，獲得通過，俟下週五之國務會議通過後，即公佈施行。聞該方案內容要　約有以下數點；　加張軍法之職權，以便於　淸剿匪之工作。　加強中央與地方之組織。　各地組織勤員　亂運動委會。　充實地方團隊自衛武力，配合國軍實施淸剿。</p>
<p>〔本報南京十八日電〕國防部部長白崇禧，日內即將出巡九江，並主持六省聯防會議決定設立之九江指揮所，加强江防。據確息；共匪有企圖調集兵力分別進逼長江北岸各口，藉作每一據點均有淺江趨勢之聲勢，俾使國軍疲於奔命，分散全力，對華北東北之軍事不克兼顧，以遂其在即將召開之國大期間，威脅京滬，擾亂人心之願望。據某權威人士稱：匪軍威脅京滬之謠言攻勢，吾人僅可信其確有分散兵力之企途，因根據某氏看法，共匪之最終目的，必在平津，而乘國軍在保衛江南及京滬之際，平津空虛，欲舉而得之，以便轉變在國際方面之視聽。軍事當局對此已預爲準備，決不致墮其狡計。</p>
<p>〔本報九江十八日〕此問因問白部長日內抵潯，已覓定房歷佈置一切。國防部要員約十人，今午專機抵潯，聞與成立指揮所有關。</p>
<p>〔本報漢口十八日電〕部主席萬耀煌，今午自京飛返漢。</p>
<p>〔中央社漢口十八日電〕軍急：　黃梅縣城十七日爲國軍收覆後，共匪第三縱隊主力殘部分股突圍，一部向廣濟方面潰逃。　企圖有霍山南竄之匪十四日接國軍殘減　　水之匪連日經國軍進剿，已向北及西北方向竄去。</p>
<h3>榆林內外國軍　正式握手會師　傅作義暢談良九灘大捷經過</h3>
<p>〔中央社寗夏十八日電〕軍息：援榆林之强大兵團，沿途擊破匪軍之阻碍，並予匪以重創後，業於十八日下午三時到達楡林北郊，正式與守軍握手會師，刻正積極國殲匪軍殘部中，綜計連日戰果，共斃傷匪八千餘人，俘獲亦衆。</p>
<p>〔中央社楡林十八日下午六時急電〕我派赴可可兒蓋之騎兵，十八日午與寗良兵團會師，預計該部十八日晚即可進抵城郊，馬時靜帥長亦已先率步兵一部於下午五時入城。</p>
<p>〔本報北平十八日電〕傅作表今日接見記者，暢談榆林外國良九漢大捷經過，盛贊馬鴻達部之英勇善戰，回　同胞之擁護中央，謂由此一戰，而扭轉陝北大局。傳氏稱：共匪中央爲重在陝北生根，乃傾其中央力量之一彭德懷部七個旅，猛攻楡林，志在必得，幸寗夏部隊大舉出援，將此有關大局之共匪攻勢擊破。寗夏多回胞，此役旣可望示回胞之擁護中央，且可看出愈接近共匪地區，民衆封之亦愈痛恨，意義車大。良九灘大捷後，馬氏曾電傳氏調：「續追可獲彭德懐！」傳氏因該區帶全是沙濟，追擊實多困難，因而未迫。十六日起，匪乃復糾集小股再犯楡林外匯，預料馬部今可與榆林守軍會師，此可予國軍以殲滅彭部機會，楡林之軍事價值還在石家莊之上，而守軍旣少，武器又差，防守困難，故有二團長四營長受傷，其中且有伊克昭盟地方團隊，均發揮其最大力量，空軍之協助亦甚得手。總之，共匪因攻楡林而受之重創，絕非其始料所及。傅氏復論國軍守「點」之意義稱：「點」乃鎧甲，匪來用以護身，非爲守「點」而守「點」，但在不宜守時，即躱開，察綏國軍對地方團隊維護備至，絕不使之吃虧，故配合甚得宜。現綏遠有形之共匪己無，察省尙有一部。傅氏並稱贊察綏人民之協力。</p>
<p>〔中央社張家口十八日電〕察省各界，聞楡林大捷後，今電榆林守城將士，暨增援楡林之寗夏國軍致敬，並電出關剿匪之察綏軍慰勞。</p>

<h3>美報論美對華政策</h3>

<h3>出席國際貿易會議代表張子柱今飛美轉往古巴　發表談話闡明會議意義及我立塲</h3>
<p>〔本巿訊〕國際貿易就業會議，定二十一日起在古巴京城哈瓦那舉行，我國首席代表金問泗已自紐約前往出席，代表張福運於十五日離滬啓程，代表張子柱（經濟部政次），顧問劉鵬九，王學濂，專員余文豪，毛立羽，秘書陸久煊一行七人，則定今日下午四時三刻，乘中國航空公司機飛美轉往古巴，張氏十八日特就國際貿易就集會議之意義及我國之立塲，發表書面談話如次：</p>
<p>國際貿易與國際經濟間題，對於全世界人類之和平共處，關係深鉅，前此兩次世界大戰，其原因雖甚複雜，而國際經濟問題，耍不失爲主要原因之一，故前國際聯盟及現在古巴京城所召集之貿易及就業會機，其目的即在於制定國際貿易組織之貿易爲國際貿易設定軌範，以期各國和衷貿易，互通有無。考此貿易就業會議之正式發動，雖係美政府於前年年底所倡議，而其基本原則，早在大西洋憲章以及頓巴敦橡樹會議中已有決定，各國政府均已了解，如各國互採關稅壁壘等種種過激保議措施，形成商業及經濟性質之爭奪，則世界經濟永無普遍繁滎之望，美國政府會於去年春季，根據旣定原則，提出國際貿易組織憲章草案一種，經聯合國經濟社會理事會於去年十月至十二月，及今年四月至十月，分在倫敦及日內瓦召集中，美，英，法，澳洲，比利時，盧森堡，巴西，加拿大，智利，古巴，捷克，印度（第二次包括巴基斯坦），黎巴嫩，新西蘭，荷蘭，挪威，南菲等十八國家（蘇聯缺席）代表，開準備會議兩次，我政府均會參與，我國在原則上向來贊成國際合作，並積極促成一切國際協調之制度，惟以我國抗戰時期較任何盟國爲久，而所受損害亦最深鉅，故戰後經濟之復興與建設問題，亦特嚴重，在尋求國際合作途徑之際，亦不得不　置考慮此種實現，並爲我未來經濟發展預留適常餘地，此種立塲，想亦爲友邦所諒解。此次古巴會議，參加國數較前更多，問題或更繁複，惟我代表團則將一本原有尋求國際合作，兼顧本國經濟發展之路綫，繼續折衝，本人亦深信各國政府本協調精神，必獲圓滿之結果也。</p>

<h3>珍重自己的這一票！</h3>
<p>舉世矚目的全國普選，將於本月廿一日開始舉行，本市三百萬選民，亦將於是日淸晨汽笛一嗚之後，開始投票，選舉國民大會代表。這次普選是我國政治上的創舉，也就是我國實行憲政的第一步。依據我國新憲法之規定，國民大會實爲我國行憲的最高機關，有權選舉及罷免國家元首之總統副總就，並有權修改國家根本大法之憲法。故行憲的第一屆國民大會的責任，尤爲重大。而國民大會代表將由此次普選而產生，每一選民投出其神聖的一惡時，其所選擇的代表是否適當，與我國民主政治的前途，實有非常重要的關係。西諺有謂：「作事愼於始謀」，開始良好，卽不難事半功倍；反之，必致事倍功半。所以在全國億萬選民郎將首次行使其憲政開始時期最神聖的選舉權之前夕，全國朝野莫不盼望全國選民咸能珍重其神聖的一票，旣不應輕易放棄，亦不可隨人擺佈。本市當局爲市民徹底明瞭此次普選的意義起見，乃在開始投票的前夕，舉行宣傳大會，俾向市民闡明初次普選的作用及其投票的方式與程序。我們認爲今天的宣傳大會，對於本市普選的進行，當有極大的裨益。</p>
<p>上海是我國最大的商埠，不論在經濟上文化上，均爲全國的中心，在這次普選中，自然佔着非常重要的地位，不僅爲國際觀瞻所　，而且市民的一舉一動，無一不足以開全國風氣之先。故上海普選的風氣，足以直接間接影響全國的政風。我們看看目前上海各界人士競選的情形，雖不能盡表滿意，但有若干候選人對於競選所採公開的民主的方式，若爲人人所效法，卽可樹立競選的良好風氣。而尤其値得稱道的，則在競選的潮流中，聽到許多軍政要人和社會聞人，因有他種重要任務或社會救濟事業待他們去負責辦理，毅然決然紛紛放棄競選，這種讓德謙風，更爲此次普選生色不少。</p>
<p>這次普選還是我國政治上的創舉，全國億萬選民投票，還是初次嘗試，所謂「登高自卑」，我們固不能保證首次普選卽可完滿達到「選賢與能」的理想，但是無論如何，我們終希望全國億萬選民，都能特別珍重自己這神聖的一票，務使本人的意見得以自由表達。須知國民放棄投票，就等於放棄自己作國家主人的權利，也就等於未能盡國民的責任：又如任便濫投，隨人播弄，視選舉爲兒戲，會不加以絲毫的考慮，則不管也爲政治上的不道德。在今日的中國，全國朝野旣一致主張實行憲政，這次普選自應認眞舉行，力求民意得以表現；唯有叛國殃民的共匪，始欲破壊普選，使中華民國憲法不能如期實施。我們盼望本市選民，於廿一日淸晨汽笛一鳴之後，卽能踴躍赴投票處，投出其對於國家負責的最神聖的一要。</p>
<p>其次，我們劃於競選者，也已一再表示我們的意見，並勸吿競選者特別重視民主政風的養成。我國開始實行憲政，可謂尙在學習的階段，在此時期舉行普選，尤其不可不特別愼重。在前幾天，因爲發生「政黨提名」與「自由競選」的爭論，會使全國議論紛紜：但是中樞仍堅決採取政黨提名的辦法，圈定候選人的名單，也已於前幾天陸續發表了。雖然有一部份競選人未能圈出，不免退有怨言，但關於政黨提名的辦法，我們始終認爲這是政黨競選的不二法門。按之歐美民主各國的　例，以　議會政治、就是政黨政治，民意非經過政黨也委實無法表達。故各黨黨員在競選時，只知有政黨，不知有個人，而且大家認爲，政黨的勝利就是個人的勝利。例如美國各州選舉國會議員，一般選民幾乎不問竸選者為何人，但問競選者爲何黨？其競選人亦由政黨提名，其發表的演說亦必爲政黨的政策，而同屬一政黨的候選人，絕不容許發表彼此牴觸的主張，更不容許其各別自由魷選。我國現在也採採取這種辦法，並不達背民主的原則。何况國民黨與民社靑年兩黨，又經過協商提名，彼此謙讓提携，毫無壟斷包辦之弊，自更足表現充分民主的精神。</p>
<p>要之，這次普選，是我國人民行使四權的第一步，初次嘗試，錯誤在所難免；但是我們終希望能减少至最低限皮。我們對於一般選民的要求，是耍他們特別珍重自己的一票，不放棄，不亂投；同時對於競選者，亦要求其採取合法民主的手段，以政見及人格來爭取選民的擁護，切不可以金錢行賄，更不可以威勢逼人；否則選舉糾紛，必致層出不窮。今天已是十九日了，二天之後，汽笛一嗚，全市選民卽開始投票，我們千句併一句，希望全國億萬選民都能珍重自己的這一票！</p>

<h3>杜魯門國內經濟政策　美國會反應不良　伊頓稱緊急援歐計劃討論將受影響　塔虎脫堅持應援助我國</h3>
<p>〔合衆社舉盛頓十八日電〕塔虎脫十八日在廣播演說中稱：「自阻止共產主義蔓延之觀點而論，援歐計劃爲必要者。我人如不改變在德與對華之政策，則此計劃又無甚効率矣。顯然馬歇爾不願以極合理之代價，將中國自共產主義中救出，而却以數百億元撥付西歐。」渠並謂毀壊德國之工廠實與歐洲復興計劃相違背者。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕共和黨總統候選人參議員塔虎脫今夜指責杜魯門建議爲「趨向究全獨裁又進一步」，並稱總統「欲時針倒退，欲同歸至戰爭時期，欲恢復物價管理，戰時努工局，及戰時生產局，渠欲管理物價以對付生產者，管理工資以對付工人，限制物品消費以對付家庭主婦及菜館，以及各種管制以對付商人。無異設立一際邦管理局，派出數十萬特務人員，監視數千工萬人民之日常生活。」</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓十七日電〕社魯門總統今日向國會發表歷時三十分鐘之演說，幾未獲得在塲議員之鼓掌歡呼。據衆院共和黨領袖哈萊克事後表示：總統於數日前猶稱物價管制爲警察國之方法，今渠本人亦提出此種建議，由此可見政府當局之亂無頭緒，及引起國內現狀之當局之無能。過去實施物價管制之結果為减少生產，誘起黑市，及物品之缺乏，國會有其他具體方法，可使國家毋庸置於極機政機之下，國會將本於此方針而行事。此間歐洲外交界人士，對總統之建議均表示熱烈歡迎，惟彼等深恐將因國會之反對物價管制而妨碍對馬歇爾援歐方案之考慮。共和黨參議員鮑樂稱：總統似欲令國會為援助歐洲而淸算美國之经濟自由。同時美國兩最大工會產業職工太會及美國勞工協會對於杜魯門之工資限定最高額政策，亦表示驚異。衆議院外交委員會主席伊頓表示：總統之提出物價管制計劃，將移轉對於緊急援歐計劃之集中注意，故料援外計劃之討論恐將因此被拖延。</p>

<p>〔聯全社華盛頓十七日電〕國務部官員今日評日內瓦協定，稱其爲空前重要之文件，謂爲歷史上關係各國彼此消除貿易障碍之一大進步。自第一次世界大戰以來，各國競相限制他國貨物進口，力諜經濟自保，此種趨勢，茲已獲得一大轉變。法國將减低美麥進口稅三分之二，豬油减百分之五十九，罐頭水果减百分之五十。廿二簽約國中多數减低美國汽車，卡車，機器脚踏車及其配件之進口稅。美貨電料，無綫電，電汽冰箱，及寫字間用具亦均享受减低進口稅優惠。</p>

<h3>義總理加斯貝利宣布　決擴大政府基礎　痛詆共黨行動阻碍復興</h3>
<p>〔合衆社羅馬十八日電〕基督民主黨之某種威發言人今日證實加斯貝利總理已在實行擴大其一黨政府，以包括中問與左翼各政黨，然無共產黨。據共黨機關機報吿，托格里亞蒂會於十七日晚在加斯貝利演說後，向米蘭共黨秘密會議發表演說稱，「如若我人在明年三月之選舉中獲得勝利，則前途可得和平，否則終將採取革命行動，此爲絕對抽象之計劃，並未將我人行動一般之發展考慮在內。」</p>
<p>〔路透社那不勒斯十七日電〕義總理加斯貝利在渠所領導基督民主黨之全國大會中致辭，聲言最近義共黨之通過要求傾覆政府之宣言，實爲一宜戰宣言。加氏力言「政府並非美國或梵蒂岡之奴隷，余本人旣非弱者，亦非獨裁者。余於失去國會之多數支持後，將自動退位，但余當鄭重宣示稅決不因革命運動而棄職之決心。義大利必須參加世界之復興，以爲和平及民主之保障。今有人公然述及義國內之內戰及新法西斯主義之發展，然對於政府維護和平及自由之每一行動則多方反對。托格里亞蒂領導之義共黨及南尼領導之極左社會黨，竟有私藏軍火者，政黨之解除武裝實爲必要。托格里亞蒂及南尼夢想之國家，均具有史達林之紅星」</p>
<p>加斯貝利所述及之共黨決議案，據云乃共黨執委會所頒佈者。此間觀察家相信，加斯貝利所稱基督民主黨無意單獨秉政之語，係暗示內閣將有更動以容納左翼溫和派，若薩拉迦特領導之社會黨等。</p>

<h3>徐繼莊迄未投案　其妻等涉嫌拘押　銀行董事及汽車司機倂押候究律師張耀廣訊後交保</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕前郵匯局局長徐繼莊被控貪汚案，經地檢處起訴後，刻在地院刑庭審理中，徐則　傳未到。警局突於本月十五日，將徐妻徐金珊如，振業銀行常務董事程天如，律師張耀廣，汽車司機曹明知四人予以逮捕。該案之發展，至爲社會人士注意。茲據警局刑事處處長孫遠方稱：「本案警局係受法院囑託，於十五日馳往泰山路二十二號捕徐，携有法院拘捕徐綱莊拘票及搜査證，因時間太早，徐本人不在，該處除徐妻外，尙有程天如等三人，因本案關係重大，故將此四人先予拘捕，蓋査彼等實有隱藏徐繼莊之嫌疑。次日適爲星期日，故延至十七日下午以「便利脫逃」罪將徐妻等四人移送地檢處辦理。」據記者探悉，該案昨經郁懿新檢察官略加訊問，以尙需詳細調査，除張耀廣交保外，其餘均暫予羈押思南路看守所。</p>
<p>地方法院書記官長黃光鈺，承辦該案推事吳榮林，昨爲此案曾向各報社記者發表聲明稱：「徐妻並未由警局移送地院，院方對逮捕徐妻，事前絕無所聞，並未囑託京局執行逮捕，亦並未派法警協同警局前往，因徐妻與郵匯局貪汚案根本無關。承辦推事並未簽發拘捕徐妻之拘票，因徐妻並非本案被吿，自與本案無涉，警局逮捕徐妻，或係另一案件。徐繼莊確未向地院投案，但曾具狀聲請不能到庭受審之原因。」</p>
<p>惟記者於昨日深夜詢問地院院長査良鑑氏，證實除律師張耀廣已保出外，徐妻等三人確在羈押中。査院長表示，黃書記官長與吳推事發表之談話，尙有未盡專實之處，今日當檢閣該案全　後，將經過情形予以發表。</p>

<p>本市擁有二十萬選民之　竹軒，致函選舉事務所，聲明放棄國大代表競選。記者特走訪顧氏，　談：本人旅滬五十年，平日對於地方公益及同鄉福利，莫不竭力以赴。自蘇北迭還戰亂，流亡　道，目擊心傷，巨前北風已起，難民飢寒交迫，救濟工作，更迫不及待，經於日昨晋謁市長，對於冬賑及工賑，已有具體辦法，急待進行。茲以本人雖承我數十萬父老兄弟愛戴，推爲國大代表候選人，但本人權衡輕重，深感致全力於數十萬難胞之急救，較之爲一己競選，尤爲迫切重要。且以此次大選，上海市名額有限，競選者又如此之多，經考慮再三，決定退讓賢能。其實在朝在野，對國家民族之義務相同，舍己助人，對社會同鄉之貢獻尤大，凡此俱屬實情，動機出於至誠，並非立異鳴高，沽名釣譽，尙祈知我愛我者諒我也云云。</p>
<p>本市工業兼名畫家胡伯翔，以平生提倡國貨運動，工業界同人，共推爲工礦界國大代表候選人。頃據胡氏表示：以工業界人才衆多，加以本身事務甚繁，並致力於研究美術，事先亦未辦理提名簽署手續，正式取得候選人資格，故放棄競選，以讓賢路云云。</p>

<h3>少年警出巡：第一天印象食客笑談威儀盡失</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市各餐館筵席節約檢查昨起正式開始。檢査粗由警察局。社會局。中菜。西菜。廚房業等同業公會各推代表組成。少年警察工參加二十五名。全市分黃浦。老閘。邑廟。泰山。虹口五區進行。昨日少年警察出動檢査，發現數點困難：　。　由同業公會推派代表陪同前往檢査，各餐館事先已有準備。　三食客在菜餐館添一炒蛋需十一萬六千元，雖未超過十二萬元之規定，但限價或條文方面等似尙有研究修改必要。　洋酒在禁用之列，但餐館將外貼商標除去，混充國產酒，頗難辨別。負責方面對此種困難正檢討力謀改進。</p>
<h3>議長繼續作競選演說　爲全體難民呼籲　拯救難民根本辦法應該誠意實施憲政</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會潘議長，昨日下午讀赴楡林區各保訪問。三時在荆州路小學發表競選演說，聽衆千餘人，情緒至爲熱烈。潘氏首稱：本市勝利復員迄今，推行地方自治，已爲兩年，區保甲之自治組織，亦已逐漸完成，但目前市自治法尙未　訂，戶籍，地政，道路，警衛，敎育等工作，尙未達到理想標準，市府官吏尙未民選，故言市之自治，則尙有待於政府法令之陸續頒布與地方自治人員之繼續勞力，而自治工作之所以未能加速進行，莫不因社會未能安定之故。上海　來難民人數，約計廿萬人，已形成本市嚴重之社會治安問題，故余今日在此特爲全體難民呼籲。</p>
<h3>所謂難民並非天生</h3>
<p>所謂難民，並非天生，而是因共匪作亂，不能在其家鄉安居樂業，不得已而背井離鄉，自蘇北，皖北及其他各地撤退來滬，故拯救難民，應爲吾人之共同責任。目前本市正發動冬令救濟工作，藉期濟助來滬之二十萬難民，度此寒冬難關，此雖甚　切要，希望大家概解仁囊。但本人所呼籲者，不僅此治標之救濟，吾人必須進一步作根本之企圖，來査出難民發生之原因，用什麽方法來「消滅難民發生之原因」，否則難民不但源源而來，救不勝救，即上海市民亦有可能做難民的。</p>
<h3>直接間接兩種原因</h3>
<p>難民發生的原因，坦白的講，有下列兩點；　共匪的稱兵叛亂，　政治的不淸明。如果在國家勝利時，共產黨徒，不恃其國際背景通匪叛亂，而與政府和　共濟，促進國家之復興，則國家立刻可以致治，而人民生計亦可以安定。共匪用殘暴或威迫的手段對付人民，固屬可恨，但吾人亦要反省，政府官吏是否個個廉潔自持，所做的事，是否件件都是「民之所好」者，故難民發生的直接原因是共匪作亂，間接原因却是政治不淸明。蔣主席昭吿吾人一面要戡亂，一面要行憲，此即吾人消滅難民發生之原因的根本辦法。吾人要拯救難民，要想目己不淪爲難民，則應正心誠意來實施憲政。</p>
<h3>中正公園簡短演詞</h3>
<p>最後潘議長解釋選舉權之行使爲國家實施民主憲政的主要關鍵，盼市民切勿輕視或放棄，並應珍惜其一票。又稱：其本人現已受命於國民黨中央，爲上海市候選人，蓋中央以其服務於上海數十年，當能獲得地方人士之信仰，仍盼上海市民本其愛護熟誠，投業推選。潘氏演說完畢後，立即趕赴中正公園，朔風凜冽中，鵠　於廣塲之聰衆，仍達萬餘人，議長以細雨漸密，僅作簡短扼要之數分鑛演詞，聽衆掌聲如雷，歷一刻鐘後始散去。又軍之友社社長劉穗銘，昨日特帶同該社藝員前往表演游藝節目，　資助興。</p>
<h3>中訓同學函電擁護</h3>
<p>今日下午五時及八時，潘議長將在文化會塲分別向四川北路區及虹口區市民發表競選演說。又中央訓練團上海同學聯誼會，爲推進無政，協助同學競選起見，會函請全體同學，發動親友家書，對於向該會登記之區域國代潘公展，方治。錢大鈞。姜懷素等同學，全力支持，以符衆望。聞日來同學函電紛馳，咸表擁護之意，此外尙有職業團體同學水祥雲。王也愚。范才睽。趙班斧等二十餘人，亦正調査協助中。</p>

<h3>筱伶自殺案冷山提答辯　觀劇夜遊難證略誘指張春帆無權告訴</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕越伶筱丹桂自殺案，張春帆依據民法第一千一百廿三條第三項，以家長身份，向地檢處控告冷山妨害自由，略誘等罪嫌。茲悉：冷山已擬就辯訴狀，指張春帆因有教唆自殺罪嫌被提起公訴後，備受社會指摘之餘，亟圖移轉輿論攻擊目標，遂爾誣告，以冀減輕本身罪責，且謂張係筱伶之表叔，（有老閘區戶口冊可　），乃係筱之五親等旁系血親，依法無告訴之權，請求駁回。至於張所控各點，據冷山答辯如下：　「秦淮月」上演之時，冷山在蘇州拍攝「機繡江山」影片，「秦淮月」之編劇與導演皆非冷山，有說明書可證。　借信箱與筱通信，因冷山常離滬拍戲，在離滬期間與國泰演員通信，討論演劇問題，並無略誘事實，而張亦不能提供證據。　告訴狀所稱觀劇夜遊，略誘姦淫一節，查約觀電影，事屬尋常，崇容作爲略誘指佐證。　至於與筱通話一節，更屬尋常，告訴狀中之聲敘方法，顯有砌詞搆陷之用意。　告訴狀稱沈益濤於筱自殺前數小時，曾受被告囑託密談一節，全數無稽。查沈與告訴人係屬至交而與被告素不相熟。至稱被告於筱自殺後，因畏罪舉家遷避，更屬無中生有，被告家居鉅鹿路，五年於茲，迄今從未遷移，有戶籍可稽，不難　按。</p>

<h3>慈善賽馬積極進行　總會調查馬匹騎師最後問題在於美軍</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕自市參議會通過冬令救濟會所提舉行冬季慈善賽馬以薄募救濟經費後，各界對於賽馬能否實現揣測頗多。茲據記者探悉，此事正在積極進行之中。跑馬總會爲欲詳知目前會員方面尙有若干馬匹可供賽跑及有若干會員願參加爲騎師。昨特通吿全體會員並附馬匹表格一紙及願爲騎師　一通，塡就寄還，以資硏究。據熟悉賽馬界人士談稱，如今冬舉行慈善賽，馬匹及騎師可不致有問題。戰前馬匹雖已散失頗多，但現時如能凑集一百五十西左右，即可經常比賽。此數並非難事，惟水準將較戰前稍差。故賽馬能否實現，將視其他兩大問題而定：　美軍所租借之會址能否答應議出一部份，此事現由市政府負責與美軍當局磋商，爲實現賽馬之最大先決條件。　賽馬期之久暫問題。如費去不少精力籌備練習以後，僅僅舉行一次或兩次賽馬，則無論跑馬總會或馬主均將不願爲之。反之，如能給予三個月至四個月之賽馬期，則預料對此道有興趣之人士當可踴躍參加矣。</p>

<h3>連雲港在冬眠中</h3>
<p>〔本報連雲巷十二日汛〕勝利後，連雲港，東海和灣雲，成爲了孤島，這隴海路的一只嘴吧，冷落已久，記者售着深秋的輕寒，坐着沒有煤燒，而改用汽車引擎拖着跑的「自動特快火車」，從新浦而到連雲市。我爬上山頂，呼吸着海洋的空氣，來踏勒這在上海，靑島之間的唯一良好港口。</p>
<h3>老窰鑿山塡海</h3>
<p>連雲港原是一塊海邊的山地，土名老　。到目前爲止，尙有許多外國商船不知運雲港，而只知通老　。民國廿二年由隴海路局建議築港。於是在二十四年春天，這荒寞的老窰，展開了一個擊山塡海的偉大工程。直到戰事發生，這裏己經有很好的建設。抗戰的烽火，蔓延到華中，連雲港的港務人員，開始撤退，並且奉令破壊港口設備。談到這件事，現任港務處處長楊先乾氏很高興地吿訴記者；破壊之後，曾懊悔未能澈底，然而在今天想想，也正幸虧沒有澈底破壊，否則，如何有這樣大的力量來再從事恢復？</p>
<p>我由胡志詩工程司陪同到碼頭上參觀，當可看見有很多上銹的鐵橋，和許多殘破的機件躺在海難上，這都是戰前破壊的遺跡。</p>
<h3>三個碼頭遺跡</h3>
<p>在敵僞盤據期間，也重建了一部份工程。現在有三個碼頭，都是敵人遺留下來的。第一號碼頭靠着防波隄，底下是木樁。因爲海中有一種小虫，專吃木頭，所以幾年來，木樁都已腐爛。爲了避免危險，港務處已經將第一碼頭拆去。目前使用較便者，爲第二三碼頭，這兩儸碼頭比較堅固，有一半是洋灰樁。</p>
<p>連雲港在戰前的每年最高吞吐量達五百萬噸，抵上海港口的吞吐量六分之一。目前它的主要任務是吐出淮鹽，我去的那天，有兩條輪船正在裝鹽，鹽是運到安徽一帶去的。可是將來隴海東段通車以後，淮鹽不從海運，那連雲港有什麼業務做，這是目前港務處內心中的一個恐慌。——儘管隴海東段通車尙需待以時日。他們眼巴巴地只希望中興煤礦早日恢復，同時隴海全綫快些通車，連雲港還是準備做大西北的一張嘴。</p>
<p>連雲港以北的臨洪口，水挾泥沙入海，於是藉着漲潮的關係，每日都有一點禮物送到連雲港來。每天增加一生的的淤泥，就够港務處傷腦筋。目前有兩架挖泥機，祖任挖泥的任務。而這兩架挖泥機所需用的煤，就是一個問題。前天好容易從台灣裝了一千噸煤來，才使港務處暫時放下了心。他們想想在戰前有兩架翻煤機，每架每小時可以運煤四百噸的往事，不免有點感慨系之了。</p>
<h3>防波兼防泥沙</h3>
<p>連雲港現有兩道防波隄。第一道在南，長約一。五公里，第二道在北，作半圓形，爲日人所建，長約三·三公里。可是它們只能防波而防不了泥沙。於是在一位荷闌籍的工程師設計下，有着一個龐大的計劃。計劃是從墟溝造一條寬大的防波隄，直接西迎島，這探，波浪泥沙，同時可以防止。然後將西連島裏面的一邊鑿平塡海，同時在南北岸各建六個碼頭，幷在北面防波堤上舖設鐵軌，使貨物能直接起卸。計劃是挺好，可是在目前的條件下，旣不能允許這樣地做，同時建築起來，是不是能够全部充份的利用是個問題。</p>
<p>在最近，楊處長吿訴我，他只想來一個太簡單的計劃。第一，加高南面的防波隄，因爲在高潮的時候，港外的海水仍舊可以侵襲到港內來。第二，重建第一碼頭。第三，完成第二碼頭，使全部都是洋灰棧。就道一個計劃，預算經費需一千六百億以上。他計劃在五年以內，可以在南岸建成十個碼頭。</p>
<h3>墟溝平原有望</h3>
<p>連雲港幾全部是山地，一些很少的平地還是築港時需要石塊而鑿出來的，因此將來在市政上的發展很少可能。只有北面的墟溝，是一塊大平原，還可以有希望。　勝利後因匪軍的盤踞，速雲市是一個孤島。鐵路未通，徐海公路被水冲壊後，恢復通軍還只是上月底的事，而來往的軍輛還是以軍車佔大多數。上海來的船很少。大米每三百廿斤要賣一百八十萬元，還有靑島客人在這裹收貨。其他如香烟之類較之蘇北其他各地，至少得貴一倍以上。京滬報紙要從靑島轉來，差不多每一週甚至兩週來一次。因此，新聞都變成歷史。</p>
<h3>路局接辦港口</h3>
<p>記者前去訪市政府，市長到上海去了，秘書也踱到徐州去。市政府的人劉連雲港也感覺到一個苦悶，他們說照例港口應歸市政府管理。現在歸路局辦，所以港務局也成立不起來，什麽建設都談不上。</p>
<p>此外，淮海綏靖區視察團團長章　翔氏在述雲港接到一封匿名控吿函。說是市長有四個老婆云云，幷且列舉三大罪狀。不過這都正題以外的事。展望未來，「建國靠西北」，只耍交通恢復，連雲港仍舊是有它燦爛的前途，正如那蔚藍的海上，白鷗上下的一幅光明而美妙的圖畫一樣。（特派記者凌松壽）</p>
<h3>難民談鹽城近情</h3>

<h3>遠征軍三度出師　馬華今戰東華　下午三時起仍在逸園</h3>
<p>馬來亞華僑組織之聯華足球遠祉軍，今日下午三時，與東華足球會作征滬第三仗於逸園球塲，門券自中午十二時半起，在市體育館預先發售，球塲大門於同時起開放，入塲券仍售二萬五千，及五萬元兩種，今日雙方出塲陣容，昨晚分別由郭昌福及賈幼良公佈於後，今日裁判陳吉祥，巡邊蔣吟僧，何春暉。【聯華】朱志成陳家萬　張國興楊嘉松　李以耀　巫錦順葉淸華　謝文庸　夏體先　胡文相　梅潤華（預備員）關順德，黃籍漢，劉風昌。【東華】張幫綸莊友仁　張林根韓龍婆　譚福禎　於洽興李垚　孫錦順　韓龍海　陳明哲　賈幼良（生力軍）金川瀚，林文虎</p>
<p>聯華在滬先後二戰，首仗以六比四小勝鐵路，次賽以一比一戰和靑白。個人技術雖甚佳妙，但實力未如理想之彈硬。今日第三戰，相逢上屆市長盃冠軍東華，出塲陣容與前二戰相仿，黃國棟因臂傷決定休息，以楊嘉松代替，近日滬上氣候暴寒，南國健兒或感不慣，惟爲保持令譽，當出全力以相周旋。李以耀坐鎭中央，威風八面，中鋒夏體先，最爲活躍，値得東華一諸將之注意。</p>

<h3>羽球聯賽　明日起報名</h3>
<p>本市羽球運動，經市體育協會羽球委會之極力提倡，各方已感濃厚興趣，成爲本市熱門運動之一，如去年之聯賽及公開賽，非特參加者非常踴躍，技術亦至優越，尤其羽球與網球性質相似，精於網球者亦必精於羽球，擅長羽球者亦類多爲網球好手，兩種球賽之時季啣接，正足以收相互準備之效，而促進球藝。</p>
<p>本屆羽球委員會由奚毓義，蔡琪，潘有源，榮得其，李國瑤，以及外僑林雪康，韜朋諸君主持之下，早經着手推動，本季團體聯賽，預定十二月初開始報名，球隊，如體運總會，人才濟濟，美國公學，設備優良，更多優秀選手，此外葡商總會，哥侖比亞總會，美國總會，曁其他外僑團體，對羽球訓練有素，逆料將來競爭興趣，必更濃厚。今年另組女子組，但我國女子似難以獨立成隊，將盡爲外僑女子競爭之目標，體運總會及葡商陣容最强。</p>
<p>上海網球會爲提倡羽球運動起見，特建造室內球塲兩片，將次竣工，日內正修築地面，此一球場之設立足供愛好羽球人士習練之地，對於促進國人羽球技術，必有極大帮助。</p>
<p>明日起分函去年參加各隊及本市各學校，歡迎參加。委員會已商借市體育館，闢設球塲三片，已粉漆完成，足供聯賽及將來公開賽之用，故塲地已無問題。</p>

<h3>華股中途挫跌臨收市勢奇俏</h3>
<p>華股昨峯迴路轉，先因棉糖結款，銀根見緊，各方一度出龍中途見跌，夜報有助買消息，人心反動，證券大戶全力出動，臨收奇俏。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>見高者多，現遞永紗同爲三三二元，開後塲外即有大戶爲某楊某之力售，是以僅遞交曾見三三五元，即吿下游，加以北帮脫手，現遞遂同時退至三二二低價，塲外息價開高至一角八及二角二分半，尙難振作。十一時後，廣帮先進即交，後又力進遞交，外股亦秀，塲外喊價亦高，曾回升至三三〇元及三三二元左右，惟屬曇花一現，散戶迫於時間，又起恐慌，加之外股亦回，景綸在混亂中跌至限度，而永紗步降至即交三一八元，遞交三二〇元低價，而後以三一九元及三二〇元之價收市。以糖棉結款，預料國行必有大差進，人心見悸也。結果較前收，即交計永公榮豐大通信誼微升，勤興火柴跌一成，閘北中法新光景福內衣中紡各跌半成，餘均微挫。遞交股計動興微升，信和美亞新光各跌半成，餘均小挫。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>永紗微升即交三二四元，遞交三二五元，國行差進一千億有零，而見三一七元及三一八元低價。夜報載有美總統援助計劃中未提我國之說，回風遂起，而漲至三二九元及三三三元，趁高有出遞交即交者，曾回落至三二五元及三二六元，圈外黑市狂躍，復傳馬卿辭職之訊，塲中猛納現永紗，臨收前躍升至即交三三四元，遞交三三五元高價，而後以三三二元及三三四元之價收市。結果較晨收，計即交股美亞火柴新光景福漲半成，閘北漲起一成强，景綸漲起一成半，永公內衣微降，信誼華峰榮峰尙平，餘均微升。遞交股美亞新光景福永紗各升半成左右，勤興低半成，餘均徵升。塲外老股除銀行股再俏一成强外，餘均穩定而已。</p>
<h3>統債平庸外股略升</h3>
<p>公債昨十分平庸，成交祗三百萬，中途起仆亦微，五○三室三六〇室賣出，六二八室則進，統丙晨開二一〇○〇元，低價二〇四〇〇元，最後微升至二一六○○元掙扎。結果絞前收計甲乙丙戊均無變動，統丁微升二百元。</p>
<p>外股昨高後曾起回風，但臨收仍受業外黑市所鼓勵，稍有回上。港申電退縮至五元左右，怡紗高價見二九八〇〇〇元，英聯亦達三七二〇〇〇元，猶太商證券帮脫手，散戶及錢兌帮則進，怡紗低至二七五○〇〇元，最後仍回上至二八四〇〇〇元左右結束，結果較前收計墾植漲半成强，業廣跌半成，英聯怡啤小升，紙版航業電車祥泰均平，餘均徽降。</p>
<h3>英匯又升六千</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕外匯掛牌昨日略有更動。美匯仍五九，五〇〇〇元，無變更。英匯一八八，〇〇〇元，提升六，〇〇〇元，港匯一一，七〇一·〇四元，提升三七三·四四元。印匯一四，〇七五·五二元，提升七四九·二〇元。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕英鎊及港幣印幣連續數次調整增高，此足證明政府已在對英鎊區域展開大規模之貿易。近日我國出產之棉紗棉布等運往英鎊區域者極多，且頗受該地居民之歡迎，目前祗感國內產量不灸。倘產量加多，內銷再加節約，增加輸出後，則可帮助政府吸收一部份外匯，以平衡外匯基金會之收支。美匯近日頗爲穩定，一般進出口商及其他握有外匯者，均以政府將開放自由外匯，而拘觀望態度云。</p>
<h3>染織廠及客幫收吸紗布又創新高價　四二支藍鳳紗再漲二八〇萬</h3>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，因滬地　碼不充，民營紗廠又以對印以紗易花，棉紗需要量增廣，而對市塲少有開出，更以布價狂漲，染織廠及客帮進胃甚健，業外套買拉提甚勁，收市各紗普創新高峯。最後四十二支藍鳳細紗昂至四千三百六十萬，比上日猛漲二百八十萬元，其他各支粗細紗續升八九十萬至一百七八十萬不等。</p>
<p>棉布市况，因各地游資來滬活動，客帮銀根鬆弛，人心受利買空氣之刺激，一致見秀。同業鑒於情勢，抵補股切，十二磅龍頭等各檔細布，再創空前高盤，較之上日均見猛漲，自五萬至十萬零五千元，成交約三四十件之　。嗶嘰以籌碼頗多，做開亦暢，上升三·五萬元，其餘各布價亦大都趨堅。</p>
<h3>紡調副主委童季齡就職　推進聯合配銷必須官商合作</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會副主席童季齡，昨晨自京抵滬，即於下午蒞會視事。關於棉紗聯合配銷問題，對記者談稱，政府當局頗爲重視，認爲紗廠如能與政府合作，聯合配銷實施時，必能噸利推進，否則實難收效。故政府當局對紡聯會所提八點意見接受考慮，已由經濟部聘請專家硏究中，將於本週四全經濟會中提出商討決定後，再呈行政院審核決定，付諸實施。至於花紗布議價，棉花已開始實施，紗布則待聯合配銷辦法決定後，當可順利解決。紗商要求配紗，該會亦可接受考慮，至詳細辦法，則尙待聯合配銷整個辦法決定後，亦可順利解決。又複製業要求參加棉紗配銷委員會事，將來該會可能採納該項要求。</p>
<h3>國家行局差入共達一千餘億</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日銀根流動甚大，國家行局因中有有千餘億紗款軋進，四行兩局共差進一〇三七億。國行差入三三九億，大交換行莊差出三七四億，洋商銀行差進一二八億，小交換行莊差出七九一億，中行差入六九八億，交通差出二一九億，中農差出六一億，中信局差進二八四億，郵匯局差出一一億，合作金庫差進七億。</p>
<h3>五萬元大鈔　國行當局表示全屬無稽之謠</h3>
<p>「聯合　信所訊」日來市上傳五萬元大鈔發行之說，部份物價，乃受影響。據中央銀行負責人表示：比又爲無稽之　。關於大鈔發行與不發行，迄至今日爲止，毫無所聞。在現階段經濟情况，與共匪造亂之局勢下，加之美國貸款，尙來具體決定，謠言成爲投機家之工具，仍盼正當商人，不要誤入牛角。</p>
<h3>到源旺食米平定</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧二萬另八百餘石，消化平平，到源湧旺，市况仍趨平定之格。粳米彷彿，秈米堅挺，白險元站立。麵粉北洋去化活躍，原料高昂，廠方　心亦堅，猛漲萬元。午時因無錫漢口兵船大量出售，頓成軟化，略見回平。麩皮鄕銷續動，客帮浙江略進，猛升七八千元，午時亦然轉懈。豆餅汕頭重見採納，回漲六七千元。黃豆聞銷蟬聯，油廠相繼收購，按步挺進，再加萬餘元。杜黃南洋動辦亦挺萬元，赤豆另化尙殷，續灌萬元。豇豆貨稀挺秀，步升三五十元。菉豆去化不振，浙方揀低略有交易，形勢平正，蠶豆到銷兩平，暫無榮辱。紅糧南洋汕頭浙江均有，納胃市勢俏俐，奔跳一二萬元。苞米北洋添辦，續漲一二萬元。芝蘇油廠收納，本街亦貪，步升萬兀。生仁廣帮依然暢納，飛黃騰達，續見猛騰四五萬元。小麥來源寥落，見挺萬元。</p>
<p>油市消化轉暢，疲而復振，生油猛漲十萬元。豆油猛加五六萬元，淸油菜油跟漲二三萬元，蔴油帶起二三萬元。</p>
<h3>人造絲繼續上揚　廠絲綢貨昨均見堅挺</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市繼續升翔，一二〇號一A旭字有光，開盤即躍出一億元關外，爲另三百萬元，卒因過高而乏人過問，曾降至一百萬元有成交，中午仍喊三百萬元賣出價，下午微呈疲軟，最後喊價爲二百萬元，終比上日高五百萬元。四A柬洋價站九千五百萬元左右。</p>
<p>廠絲</p>
<p>昨市向榮，因人絲高揚，人心爲之振奮，各級五擔頭喊價，比上日俱大起四百萬至五百萬之譜，中級另擔價做七千萬元，高另擔七千二百萬元有成交。老虎灶絲六千六百萬元亦有做開。干經昨日漲勢較緩，特上另擔，價在五千一百萬元之左。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市隨原料上揚，　絲被面漲起一百四十萬元，大誠及華强貨，開市二千六百萬元，繼即升至六百五十萬元，旋因空方紛紛拋售，價乃回降，在即期二十萬元，隔日期三十五萬元間盤旋。收市復升至即期二十五萬元，今日期四十萬元。下午一度降至五百九十萬元，最後仍做上午收市價，華錦縐及民生花綈林記蠟羽紗，六二三千元，其他各貨，莫不提升。</p>
<h3>桐油豬價俏</h3>
<p>熟悉桐油動態者稱，本期各地價格略升，重慶每市担一百十萬元，漢口一百卅八萬元，上海一百六十萬元，長沙一百卅八萬元，萬縣一〇九萬元，梧州一百五十四萬元，廣州一百六十萬元。國外價格，紐約現貨每磅美元二六·二五分，發電裝船散艙油每一磅C＆F二角五分半，尙未站牢，折合對美匯率爲國幣一百五十一萬元，市價則爲一百六十萬元，再加運費一百萬元，上海收價，出口桐油虧損甚大，漸覺困難。因此香港市塲見好，倫敦桶裝油每長噸C＆F　二〇五英磅。據猪鬃業昨向記者談，目前各級猪鬃價稱：天津改良五五號，每關担三千八百萬元，二六號三千一百萬元，重慶鬃渝價一千八百五十萬元，上海　一千六百萬元，漢口鬃無市。國外價格，天津六五五每磅C＆F美金六元，小五五號每磅美金四元,廿六號每磅美金三元，重慶黑　每磅C＆F美金一·九元，或英鎊十四先令，渝花業每磅C＆F一·六元，稍有成交，較前均見略漲。</p>

<h3>論文藝作品的感動性</h3>
<p>— 風來</p>
<p>「眞正的故事在一本書的封面之內，並不像在讀者的心裏那麽多。」這，是「文藝鑑賞諭」的作者英·普列査特的警句。</p>
<p>普列査特的意思，即是認爲人們閱讀文藝作品，其主要的興味，並不在於結構完密，辭句綺麗，或者意象的想入非非，而却是要能在作品裏發現自己，發現自己的靈魂，以喚醒隱藏內心的思維，照亮生命中模糊的希望，回憶，或一切悲哀和甘美的信念與經歷。換一句話，就是說每一讀者都有他的生活，縱令平凡，亦是眞實，而尤是親切。所以，就極多數的讀者而諭，自己「心裏的故事」將遠勝於「一本書封面之內」的故事，遠勝於一切文字表現的變幻，曲折和離奇。——郝末，人們又爲何還耍閱續文藝作品呢？這是因爲人們常常茫然於自己的思想意識及心情，人，火扺最不易了解自己的精神形態，而渴求一種誘導，激發，甚或是改塑與創造的啓示。平庸的心靈將如何凈鍊？孤高的心靈將如何淸明？浮躁的怎樣深思？凄凉的怎樣溫暖？軟弱者怎樣堅强？愚昧者怎樣聰　？喧嚷的人間怎樣更新？困惑的世紀進向何處？同氣相求，能共建好的精神，　變昇華，能消滅壊的觀念。………；「文藝是生命的表現」，因此，人們要看書。「密爾頓是男性愛讀的，但丁是女性愛讀的，靑年愛讀拜侖，中年喜讀華滋奉斯，人們讀文藝作品而感到自已生着，好比被襲於睡魔時自己底手接觸自己底膝而發見自己生着。」這一位文藝理論家的話並沒有錯。人們都渴欲發現眞正的自我；——人類的天性唯此才能感動，因爲「眞正的」自我實即係人類永恒的性格，是宇宙一體的「大我」，是人人皆看的「人性」。——人們所仰望於文藝作品者，是要從作品的感性裏找到自身的感動，我到世界，時代和生活，找到人生，溫習或創造心靈之光，從一個書中感動的故事引出深心更多的眞正故事。</p>
<p>以此，羅曼羅蘭證：「文辭底價値全靠它所表現的心靈。」</p>
<p>寫到這裏，我們已很可明白，一件好的文藝作品，即是一件最能如願地引起讀者深心最大的共鳴，使讀者最親切地感覧生命與「人生的眞實」的作品，亦即作品的第一要素。「感動性」的多少優劣，是作品的人間意義和社會價値之關鍵所在，是作品的　作品才有能大感動讀者，才有</p>
<p>答案也十分簡單，返本歸源都務須眞實親切。</p>
<p>此兩者，兼含了寫作態度和寫作技巧問題，決定了作品的好壤。作品的風格儘可人人而殊，但百川歸海，古今中外決沒有不真實不親切的作品而可以感動人心。</p>
<p>先請作品的「眞實」：「即使爲王座，也永勿欺妄眞理」。這句貝多芬的各言値得記取，不要揑造謊言，不要無中生有，一個作家要深入，要實踐，尋覓眞理，抒寫眞實，取材於人生與生活，事實的光彩美於」切。複雜的世界，眩目的年代，在過去有幾千年的人類文化，往後有無窮的未來，在這樣偉大的塲面之下，我們的作家難道不能寫一點普遍的，不朽的，深入的東西？嘉萊爾論及詩人彭士，曾謂其最最要的代表優點是「眞誠」；是的，要誠懇地忠實於人性，生命，人類進的展可歌可泣的歷程和人們永恒的德性，忠於寫作，寫出來的作品才能感動人。</p>
<p>巴爾扎克寫法蘭西社會，哥　寫熱情，杜甫寫離亂，李淸照寫「簾捲西風」的黯然之境，莫泊桑寫小市民的悲哀歡喜，………這些都爲眞實而具體感人。無病呻吟固可笑，人工的假花也決不能流露自然的芬芳。雖然不一定要親身經歷，但至少要用眼用耳，用思想和心來經驗，理解或體念那將爲你所寫下的作品。</p>
<p>再說到「親切」：文藝作品旣然主要地要去感動讀者，則心靈要共鳴，情感要匯流，當然不可能在表現和感應上生硬陌生。愛默孫曾言：「凡是莎士比亞說到國王的話，逮地一個在角落讀着的少年覺得對於他自己也是確當的。」道句話，眞說明了莎翁之所以能成世界文豪的原因，說到了世上千千萬萬讀者的心理。蓋無論何時何地何人，內心都時有一種矛盾的常常相同的情操，在隱匿中潛移默化而又極欲針展爆發，一件好的作品，就耍能給這種矛盾情操以協助，昇華和合理的和諧，但這又必得有使讀者感到與作品的抒寫悲喜相關的親切之筆方可收其效能。人們有時想哭，有時想笑，有時有成功的響往，有時有說不出的苦悶，或許還藏着純潔的眼淚和神秘的憎恨與愛情，總希冀天涯海角，求一知昔。有一天如果他們竟得到了，在一件美好的文藝作品裏得到了，在字裏行間，洋溢着溫柔熱烈的感情，發現了靈魂的影子，這，對一個善良懇摯的讀者，覺得在人間並不孤獨枯寂，人間還有着可貴的心心相印之情，將多麽感激，多麼感動！</p>
<p>員多芬或米開朗其羅傳記中的堅毅精神；「曼儂」的强烈性格；「茶花女」的苦戀；陶淵明詩的恬淡自然；左拉的小說裏的可憐人的庸碌愚蠢；蕭伯納的劇本裏的靈敏機智；「約翰，克利斯朶夫」中的人生進取之心的英勇；…………這一切，都全靠着親切之情，遂使世間無數無數的續者，與之一起煩悶，嘆息，省悟，掙扎，歡呼；再從此獲得超於個人的精神，更向前行，又得到了從所未有的心靈的進展，得到一片光明。</p>
<p>就這樣，讀者們取得不但比書本封面之內，而且比心靈中原有的，更多更多是故事」，智慧和感動。</p>
<p>又何况，眞實的作品特別容易顯得親切，而親切的作品也常常是眞實。這兩者互爲因果，互相參證，異途同歸；合成寫作之大道。因爲人類的眞理不變，宇宙的精神依然，生命，生活，人性，和其他的不朽的主題，在一部優秀美好的作品裏，將永遠眞實，親切，永遠能感動人。</p>
<p>永遠能感動人的作品，正如一顆光輝燦然的賓石，在一切的時間照耀，在一切的空間照耀！</p>
<p>謹借用拉馬爾丁的言語以作此文終結：</p>
<p>「知道能感動人，便懂得一切了。」</p>

<p>黃鶴飛仙去，山樵意自濃；秋深霜葉老，江海白雲封。</p>
<h3>門</h3>
<p>— 阿川</p>
<p>現在，我（成千成萬像我一樣的人）被關在一間寂寞，陰間，像地獄那樣沒有陽光，嗩有風雨的小屋裏。</p>
<p>這真是一間小屋，舉起手，我就會碰着發霉的棟木。屋子的每一處都在朽爛，泥地上流滿了涔涔的血液，白色的毒菌在墻脚邊開花結果，蛆在骷髏上爬，螢火虫亂飛亂舞的撞着人的臉，染滿血跡的墻上開蕭硯池那樣大的窗。窗上經緯縱橫地織着黑色的　條。</p>
<p>沒有陽光，霉氣啃着人的靈魂。於是：我將希望寄託在那扇紫色的門上。</p>
<p>「門應該開了！」我想：「門開了，一大束紫色的丁香擠進門來，插着白翅的神帶笑地立在門邊，小屋裏充滿了芬芳。」</p>
<p>「門開了，門外是一片蔚藍的天，自由的風，溫柔的雨，陽光畫出了花影，雨點像千萬枝銀箭攢向地面。」</p>
<p>我慢慢地走向門邊，紫色的門上佈滿了發亮的鐵蒺藜，門，莊嚴的，威武的朝着我。</p>
<p>在門邊，我又聽到了慘叫聲，慟哭聲，我又聞到了動物腐爛的腥臭。</p>
<p>「溫柔的雨，自由的風。」我想着。</p>
<p>我用發抖的脚踢踢門。</p>
<p>門外響起了鏗鏘的金屬聲，誰又在門上加上鎖。</p>
<p>我害怕地離開了門；可是門外有溫柔的雨，自由的風。</p>
<p>怱然，我向門表現了力量，我將整個性命交給了門。</p>
<p>我在自由的原野裏跳着舞，我看見成千成萬像我一樣的人們躺在門邊。</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我重又點了點頭，作爲答覆其實，對於「嘯」這種古老而已近乎失傳的東西，我是一個劃一不二的門外漢，不特不懂得，通嘯的發聲，究竟是怎麽一個音色，從來不曾聽見過；到底像笛聲，還是像喇叭，還是像阮小七打的呼哨？</p>
<p>我其所以點頭，表示明瞭，一則長要耀羣繼續說下去，一則在我意想中確也有兩種聽渦聲音，一是海濱靜夜的濤聲，一是松林的風嗚，這時權且把它當作嘯聲。再要指出一種，那就除非是朔風穿檽的噓噓鬼呌。</p>
<p>耀羣見我對這第二點也點了頭，不免有些驚訝，而又很高興似的：「好，那我們就可解決問題了！……您知道，照古嘯譜上，　發音方式共有十五種。除了心嘯，意嘯，神嘯，三種，格調過於神化之外，其餘十二種，我們都可學得到家。這十二種中，有丙種是屬於喉部發音的，呌作什麼「小沉」「大沉」的，尤其合於我們的理想；因爲這種嘯聲，近身邊聽來，極其細微，而在相當的遠距離點，却極淸揚。……」耀羣說到這裏，又作一度停頓，她的兩隻　目，發出一閃一爍的光耀，似乎要在我的面部上，找到一個同意的答覆</p>
<p>我呢，因要聽她往下說去，縱然心下委實莫明其妙，面容上也竭力裝出極其瞭解的神悄。</p>
<p>「我把短波笛和喉音，這兩種發音原理滲和起來，結果就得一種「半長波」—這是我杜撰的名詞—發音方式，把唇，齒，舌，喉，按短香波笛和「喉嘯」，理想的機械形式，逼緊聲帶，發出一種「叱」聲。這種叱聲，近身邊雖也可以聽到，遠距離却尤其高吭；空程距離，大概在二里左右，可以達到焦點。所以在平曠地帶，可以隨便放音，山谷地區，却得把頭仰起，向空噓嘯才行」。</p>
<p>「那麽，剛才我怎麼聽不見？」我始終禁不住了，堅持着這個愚而近乎騃的問題。</p>
<p>「這大槪有兩個原因：」耀羣吐了一口氣，把逼緊的精神，鬆滯了下來：「一者，您恐怕精神專注在別的問題上，而且從未聽到過這種嘯聲，常然聽不見；就是聽見了，因和別的聲昔雜在一起，您大概不能辨別。第二種關係，這裏距離申先生發聲所在，少說也有二里以上，又是山谷地帶，我們所能聽到的，大概只是一些餘音，非得經過練習，耳昔極聰，才能聽到一些些，虎弟這孩子，您知道，他的官覺，旣聰又明，似乎是超出尋常的……第一次的警號，連我也沒聽到咧」。</p>
<p>「嘿！」我這才也吐了一口氣，一面弛張了我的注意力，一面驚訝着其中的複雜道理。同時，我又想到　羣剛才說過大傻子所發傳聲，是「第二度，」表示並無危險，所以又問耀羣：「怎麽呌作弟二度」？</p>
<p>「哦，」耀羣險上，忽地現出一付頑皮神情，好像預備要打趣我的樣子，但立又肅正了顏色；「您因專心注意這個傳聲玩意，大概把咱們空谷傳聲和密碼方式都鬧忘哪！……可是這種傳聲，只有「三度」，—也是我們杜造的—一，一長加一促，是第一度，表示互相探詢所在，互相招呼等等。第二度；兩個長拖音，表示呼助，却不緊急。第三度；一長加三四個促音，連連重複，表示危險……對方的答應，也是如此……」</p>
<h3>唐石霞大定畫展引</h3>
<p>— 潘伯鷹</p>
<p>書畫之這有內外二緣，亦若太極兩儀之說也。紙絹之異，筆墨之分，南北之派別，工筆與寫意之區劃，與夫作者功力之深淺，皆緣於外者也。至着根器之鈍　，遭際之亨賽，因而感於心目發乎揮灑，則皆緣於內者也。謝赫首論六法，而以氣韻生動爲指歸。蓋合內外二緣而言之也。夫根器秉於天，遭際由於世。盛世所造者多雄麗而恢閎，叔世所造者多奇送而變幻。尤以鼎革之際，其奇變於世事者益多，其發揮於六法者益著。遠古不必言矣。彝齋松雪八大石濤皆勝國之王孫，爲新朝之宗匠。迨乎淸社旣屋，民國肇興，其事又有絕異於前代者。則以遜淸以前之鼎革，皆止於帝室易姓而已。民國之興，乃民主之初基，國史之創例。言乎五族一家之業，遜淸帝胃亦與有功。是以淸之王孫宗室，無芟夷之厄，有富厚之資。其有文足耀者，且並得隱逸之名，居謨議之選，如溥雪齋心番兄弟，其尤爲當世所重者也</p>
<p>於此有人焉，秉絕世之靈心，賦　修之美德，誕身貴戚，作嬪懿親。以英特之才，首倡與論於滬濱，而爲奕劻所潛斥者，乃其父也。以柔明之質，力葉德宗之新政，而爲那拉所扼殺者乃其姑也。此其人則唐石霞女士是矣。當日寇披猖之始，女士知石敬瑭與張邦昌之事將復見於令。懼茅茹之連，乃微服南行，毅然割絕。隱居淞浦，與世相遺。掃眉之餘，以畫自適。日月不居遂十五載矣。其畫淵源馬夏，與心參宗法相同。而雍容名貴，兼資二李，則非若馬夏賸水殘山之比。抑北宗之法，自唐子畏運以細　，遂開新境，文仇相扇，取則不遠。明以來，師法北宗之高手未有不兼取南宗者。故後世之北宗，非若馬夏之大輅椎輪也。此其秀骨珊琱之格調，亦於女士之畫見之。夫以松雪石濤之遭際，乃現於女子之身。以夏珪馬遠之風神，乃出於織繼之手。以石敬瑭張邦昌無恥之爲，乃夷然自脫於塵垢之外。則其畫之必傳，可斷言也。而世有眞賞，必不於若此之盡而遺之，亦可斷言也。</p>
<p>頃者，女士將陳其書於中國畫苑，以諗海上鑒家。先期折柬邀諸名公評之。不鄙謂余，亦辱其次。嗚呼。寒家與女士父族，蓋有雅故。余少時數得奉手於其尊君。靑眼高歌，謂是忘年之契。余嘗望見女士於家慶之筵，當未及加筓之歲。端莊嫻雅，儀態萬方。宛亦天家之貴主也。及茲相見，世難屢屬。而女士修竹自倚，聖妍益淸。欣慨之懐，云胡能已？因思黃魯直之姨母李夫人，趙子昂之妻管夫人，乃至近世錢陳羣之母陳書惲壽平之姪淸於，皆千秋不朽人也。余今乃得見李管陳惲之復出，以視貴主之榮，倜乎遠矣。然則興感於家國，寓意於丹靑，於余所陳內外二緣之誼，適冥契其天倪也。故忘其媕陋而樂爲之引。丁亥立冬後二日寂娛學人暫止齋謹記。</p>

<h3>痰談</h3>
<p>— 亦云</p>
<p>「痰吐入盂」，到處可見；然則無盂即無痰乎？，此說却不能成立。譬如吃飯，大家都說要用飯碗，提到「飯碗」這兩個字，我們的頭腦裏，便湧現出　隻不大不小的碗，堆得高高的，白白的，鬆鬆的，　　的——是盛飯的器具。其實沒有這飯碗，便不能吃飯麼？此說之不能成立，最低限度，常如吐痰不一定要用痰盂，一樣的簡單。</p>
<p>你看見過手抓飯吃麼？當然看見過的。你又曾看見過用報紙盛飯麽？也許，因爲你不常跑到馬路上來，還沒有見到這種精彩的鏡頭，其實街頭的流浪者，在　着包飯祖子，搶倒冷飯時，用地上隨便拾起來的一角報紙，裏着珍珠般寳貴的飯粒，是常有的事。</p>
<p>以此類推，吐痰面必須見到痰盂的，不但是合乎禮貌，舉止文雅；而且是多少要衣食足，而比較有修義的，才能做得到。莫小看痰盂這東西，家裏不備麻雀牌的倒有，尋不出痰盂罐的部少。而且在富　堂皇的應堂裏，能與紫檀紅木的傢具，周鼎秦彝的古玩，以及名人書畫，錦繡　幔，爭一日之常短者，亦惟高可及膝，擦得雪亮，重可數十斤的，雪白大銅痰盂而已，</p>
<p>至於辦公室，公共塲所，以至寺院廟宇……凡是人跡所到之處，痰盂總是見得到的，有人稱我們民問的一句不堪入耳的話，叫做「國駡」，假定言之而成理的說法，似乎痰盂也可以名之爲「國器」吧？何國人之痰多，一至於此也？悲夫！</p>
<p>痰之歷史亦殊悠久，見於醫籍者，有痰喘，痰火，痰厥，痰飲……等名，而痰迷心竅一語，尤爲人所習知，因爲其下可接以語無倫次也。痰眞是壊東西，痰湧，痰塞可以致人之命。患肺結核的人，其痰中往往帶有病菌，吐在地上，很容易令人傳染，尤其可怕。惟有發自腦後的所謂「雲遮月」的聲音，剛柔相濟運成悅耳，老譚唱戲，善用此聲，據說就是得力於一部份的痰音，痰之其有美感，而給人欣賞的，恐怕至而止了。</p>
<p>痰是髒東西，寫這個字的時候，連筆尖上也膩膩地叫人感覺齷齪，何况在看到一口口的………滿地都是呢，因之別的東西都可以用透明的料子做，惟有玻璃痰盂在這「潑拉斯的克」時代中，似乎還沒有漏過臉。除非傑傳說中的李鴻軍，當他出使俄國時，某次在宴會席上，因爲年老多痰，一時無法應急，權把高脚玻璃酒杯，借用了一下。至於普通人，即使他自己的那口撈什子，恐怕也誰都不願意從玻璃的透明器中，顯現法身罷。</p>
<p>香　　　上，往往可以發現瓷質的小痰盂，黛玉型的瘦弱女子，視此爲伴，原無足怪。而昂視闊步的先生們，脖子一伸，喉嚨裏一聲響，連咳帶吐，爽利無比地，把那口痰冲了出來。這時候間題却來了，痰盂乎？地板乎？或馬路乎？「禁止隨地吐痰」者，除了痰盂，手帕，紙張……得以接受這貴賓之外，其他塲合都在禁止之例，而「隨地」兩字尤須痛改。</p>
<p>四十以上的人，假咳嗽，眞吐痰，並非偶然。一則是裝腔做勢，二則是迫不得已。一個人的地位與身份愈高，環境愈好，不自然的咳嗽也愈多，反之，凡是營養不足，地位卑微，以及精神萎靡者，雖不咳嗽，而痰如潮湧，有欲罷不能之勢。故咳嗽不一定是毛病，大人先生們往往以此爲表示身份的裝飾品。其作用猶之着了皮鞋走路，履聲　　，不一定是身體矯健的象徵，而表示他地位之重要的成份却比較多。至於痰爲貧弱的產品，却是大家所公認的。</p>
<p>因此有一結論，與其禁止吐痰，倒不如提倡健身；旣全體面，又切實際。西洋人家裏不備痰盂，沒有隨地涕吐的惡習慣，這決不是得力於「禁」，國人之多痰，由來已久：我們旣自認爲積弱的病夫，就應該硏究痰之來源，和去痰的方法，一切從根本着想。揚湯止沸，粉刷門面，其作用等於假咳嗽；禁者自禁，吐者自吐；禁而復吐，吐而復禁；倒不如努力於根絕的方法，積極於强種健身，改良生活，庶幾不禁不吐，而民得生乎！</p>

<h3>爲難民請命</h3>
<p>— 斯芒</p>
<p>氣象台發出了驚人的消息：西伯利亞寒流即將製滬。這消息幾乎此其他任何消息都重要，尤其是對於難民，關係更爲密切，直接受到威的就是他們。</p>
<p>上海受寒流威脅的難民有二十萬人。這個駭人聽聞的數字，幾乎占全上海人口的二十分之一，雖然這數字不很眞確，但由事實看來，至少不會少於二十萬人。</p>
<p>日前上海市冬令救濟委員會開會討論這問題，決定救濟費用需六百億，雖然政府撥給一百億，但相差之敷仍甚遠，以及總數的六分之一，還有六分之五需要另行設法，除去義賽及增加娛樂捐而外，必須向各位勸募，以凑成這一個數字。所以目前要展開的募捐運動，希望每一個人，無論男女老少，都要各盡己能，踴雖輸捐，以拯救在飢寒交迫中的難胞。</p>
<h3>「春花秋放」</h3>
<p>— 范瘦梧</p>
<p>讀十月卅一日申報載有鎭江通訊一則，略謂：「南門大街蝦蟆院十號張步靑宅花園中，花草雜陳，日昨該園中牡丹，石榴，海棠相繼感開，中以牡丹最稱奇異，花瓣紫紅，花盤似碗，空枝無葉，花開枝端，邑人僉以爲春花秋放，實屬奇聞」。</p>
<p>按照時令，本已到了「草木黃落，蟄虫咸俛」的季秋時令，但半月餘來，一直是小春般的天氣，和風煦拂，中人欲醉；〔　老按：十八日起天氣已驟然變寒）當正午的辰光，要如你在日光裏多走一些路的話，簡直可以穿夏季西裝，無怪連日各報的地方通信版，絡續刊載了許多：「秋行春令，桃李爭芳」與本報「牡丹朶朶開」當同的新聞。由於近日的「春花秋放」使我聯想到「秋行春令」的時令的反常。偶憶禮記月令箭裏，對秋行春令和秋行夏令，有個預書般的解答；「季秋行夏令，則其國大水，冬藏殃敗，民多　嚏。季秋行春令，則煖風來至，民氣懶惰，師興不居」。固然，今年的秋天是行過夏令的，也已行過春令了；面不久之前，秋潮所造成之黃泛的浩刦，秋老虎所帶來疫病的吃人，看上去鄕一件不給這個時令反常的預言言中？</p>
<p>我們面對着人禍天災，兵荒馬亂的世局，更欣賞着這些春花秋放的新聞，頗不信呂不韋把十二月時令雜凑着三代以及秦國故事的「斷爛朝報」，居然含有這樣應驗的哲理。難道世間有了反常的人事，一定有反常的天時，有了反常的天時，一定有反常的人禍和天災，其問互爲朕兆，而永遠作强烈的對照的嗎？這點，必需韶待於世界大哲學家來替我們解答了！</p>

<p>— 術柴扉</p>
<p>五十年前的廣吿術，並不像如今這般，以挑鬥誇張的姿態出現於報章雜誌，通都大邑，以及鎭的街頭巷尾的。五十年前，在美國報紙上我們發現過這樣一段關於出售牙粉的鄕有趣廣吿：</p>
<p>「我誠　地要求社會人士購用「大衆牙粉」。這種牙粉比我舖子裏別種牌子的牙粉並不高明一點，也並不便宜一點……但是我想至少它的品質同別種牌子一樣好，我特別推薦「大衆牙粉」，因爲它是我的姪兒監製的，他是）個很守信用的年靑人，如果「大衆牙粉」的銷路最近能够好一點的話，那他不久就有希望可以結婚了」。</p>
<h3>化貪污爲廉明</h3>
<p>— 安壽</p>
<p>一二個有力者的言行，常常曾造成一個時代的風氣或轉移一個時代的風氣。這事實在歷史上眞見不鮮，顯著的如晋初的淸淡和南北朝的崇尙彿敎，風願一世，其初實亦不過由於幾個帝王卿相喜歡如此而已。</p>
<p>淸朝康熙中則有這樣一個故事：</p>
<p>——湯文正公（斌）撫吳時，以淸介自勵，敦厚風化。其下屬有貪酷者，皆着爲勸勉，其不改者，始以法懲之。郭總憲（　）時任吳江令，以貪　聞，公檄至省，敎以貞康。郭日：「　所以貪酷者，以供前任某撫軍之慾故也，今公旣已淸廉自矢，請寬一月之期，如聲名猶若昔，請公立置典刑可也」。歸自洗其堂無日：「前令郭琇已死，今來者又一郭琇也」。其政治爲之一變。（嘯亭雜錄卷四。湯文正）</p>
<p>這故事的主角郭琇，是一位辦事極其辣手的能吏，假使照地初期的路綫發展下去，仗着他的本領、無疑將成爲一個大貨官。但是結果他做了些，什麽事呢？據史載：郭琇後期在吳江的政績爲東南第一，湯斌　之於朝，　陞御史。曾彈劾大學士余國柱等結黨行私，背公納賄。晚年做湖南巡撫時，貪吏盡被劾去，吏治爲之一淸。</p>
<p>以一個出名的貪官一變而爲出名的廉吏，且從而芟除了許多貪官，其故由於湯斌之一念。如果湯斌也是一位貪官的話，則郭琇的貪汚必將更甚，到後來做大官時被芟除的也一定不是貪官而是廉更了。</p>
<p>機括至微，影響則極大。</p>
<p>當這個貪汚流行的年代，我們很希望執政者都有湯斌一樣的操守，至少不要使部下用「貪酷」所得來供自己的「慾」。那麽，化貪汚爲廉明，當非杳茫雖期。</p>

<h3>Political Yuan Passes Bandit Suppression Plan; Bai Chongxi to Inspect in Jiujiang Within Days; Key Defense Ministry Personnel Arrive in Xun Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The bandit suppression plan decided upon by the Six-Province Joint Defense Conference was submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting on the 18th. After two hours of careful discussion, it was slightly revised and passed. It will be promulgated and implemented after being passed by the State Council meeting next Friday. It is reported that the main points of the plan are as follows: 1. Increase the authority of military law to facilitate the work of suppressing bandits. 2. Strengthen the organization of the central government and local governments. 3. Local organizations establish committees for encouraging the people. 4. Replenish local militia self-defense forces to cooperate with the national army in implementing suppression.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi will inspect Jiujiang within days and preside over the Jiujiang Command Post established by the decision of the Six-Province Joint Defense Conference to strengthen the river defense. According to reliable sources, the communists are attempting to concentrate their forces and separately approach various ports on the north bank of the Yangtze River, creating the impression that each stronghold has a tendency to cross the river, so that the national army is exhausted and its strength is dispersed, and it cannot take care of the military affairs in North China and Northeast China, in order to achieve their desire to threaten Beijing and Shanghai and disturb people's minds during the upcoming National Congress. According to an authoritative source, we can only believe that the communist army's propaganda offensive to threaten Beijing and Shanghai is indeed intended to disperse our forces, because according to this person's view, the ultimate goal of the communists must be Tianjin and Beijing, and while the national army is defending Jiangnan and Beijing and Shanghai, Tianjin and Beijing will be empty, and they want to take them by storm, in order to change the international perception. The military authorities have made preparations for this and will never fall for their cunning plan.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Jiujiang, 18th] In response to Minister Bai's arrival in Xun within days, a residence has been found and everything is being arranged. About ten key members of the Ministry of National Defense arrived in Xun by special plane this afternoon, which is said to be related to the establishment of the command post.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 18th] Chairman Wan Yaohuang of the department flew back to Hankou from Nanjing this afternoon.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hankou, 18th] Military Urgent: After the National Army recovered the county seat of Huangmei on the 17th, the main force of the communist Third Column broke through in several groups, and one part fled towards Guangji. The bandits who attempted to flee south from Huoshan met the remnant of the National Army on the 14th. The bandits who had reduced the water have been suppressed by the National Army for days and have fled to the north and northwest.</p>
<h3>National Army Inside and Outside Yulin Officially Shake Hands and Join Forces; Fu Zuoyi Talks About the Victory at Liangjiutan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 18th] Military News: The powerful corps supporting Yulin, after breaking through the obstacles of the bandit army along the way and inflicting heavy damage on the bandits, arrived at the northern suburbs of Yulin at 3 pm on the 18th and officially shook hands and joined forces with the defending army. They are now actively encircling and annihilating the remaining bandit army. In total, the results of the battle in recent days have resulted in more than 8,000 bandits killed or wounded, and many captured.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Yulin, 6 pm on the 18th, Urgent Dispatch] The cavalry we sent to Kekeer Gai met with the Ningliang Corps at noon on the 18th. It is expected that the unit will reach the suburbs of the city tonight. Commander Ma Shijing has also led a part of the infantry into the city at 5 pm.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] Fu Zuoyi met with reporters today and talked about the victory at Liangjiutan outside Yulin, praising the bravery and good fighting skills of Ma Hongda's unit, and the support of the Muslim compatriots for the central government, saying that this battle has reversed the overall situation in northern Shaanxi. Mr. Fu said: The communist central government wanted to take root in northern Shaanxi, so it tilted its central force, Peng Dehuai's seven brigades, and launched a fierce attack on Yulin, determined to win. Fortunately, the Ningxia troops came to support in a big way and broke the communist offensive that was related to the overall situation. There are many Muslims in Ningxia. This battle can show the Muslims' support for the central government, and it can also be seen that the closer to the communist area, the more the people hate them. The significance is great. After the victory at Liangjiutan, Mr. Ma telegraphed Mr. Fu, saying, "Continuing the pursuit can capture Peng Dehuai!" Mr. Fu said that because the area was all sandy, it was difficult to pursue, so he did not force it. Since the 16th, the bandits have re-assembled small groups to attack the foreign exchange outside Yulin. It is expected that Mr. Ma's unit can join forces with the Yulin garrison today, which can give the national army a chance to annihilate Peng's unit. The military value of Yulin is even higher than that of Shijiazhuang, but the garrison is small, the weapons are poor, and the defense is difficult, so two regimental commanders and four battalion commanders were injured, including the local militia of the Ik Zhao League, who all exerted their greatest strength, and the assistance of the air force was also very successful. In short, the heavy damage suffered by the communists due to the attack on Yulin was definitely not what they had expected. Mr. Fu also discussed the meaning of the national army guarding "points," saying, "Points" are armor, used to protect oneself when bandits come. One does not guard "points" for the sake of guarding "points," but retreats when it is not appropriate to guard. The national army in Chahar and Suiyuan takes great care of the local militia and never lets them suffer losses, so the cooperation is very appropriate. At present, there are no visible communists in Suiyuan, and only a part in Chahar. Mr. Fu also praised the cooperation of the people in Chahar and Suiyuan.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 18th] After hearing about the victory at Yulin, all sectors of Chahar Province telegraphed their respects to the soldiers defending the city of Yulin and the Ningxia National Army who reinforced Yulin, and sent telegrams to the Chahar and Suiyuan armies who went out to suppress the bandits to express their condolences.</p>

<h3>National Army in Yuncheng Also Joins Forces</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The national army rushing to aid Yuncheng, after defeating the bandit army in the suburbs, has joined forces with the defending army in the city, and one of its vanguards is sweeping up scattered bandits in the south of the city.</p>
<h3>Generals in Beiping Continue to Discuss Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shangguan Yunxiang Conveyed the President's Instructions</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] Fu Zuoyi, Sun Lianzhong, Chen Jicheng, Ma Fawu, Shangguan Yunxiang, etc., continued to meet at the Beiping Pacification Headquarters today and had lunch together. According to the instructions conveyed by Shangguan Yunxiang from the President, there are new arrangements for the situation in the north.</p>
<h3>It is Said that the Defending Army in Yuanshi Fought Bitterly and Has Been Broken into by the Bandits</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 18th] The fierce battle in Yuanshi has been going on for days. The bandits used heavy artillery cover and attacked fiercely day and night. The defending army fought back bravely and killed many bandits. The bandits have increased their reinforcements several times, and their strength has reached more than 50,000. External communication from Yuanshi was cut off in the afternoon of the 16th. It is reported that it was broken into by the bandits last night, but the military here has not confirmed it.</p>
<p>[Another Telegram] There are no battles outside Baoyuan. The bandits in the southern section of Baoshi have been building fortifications along the south bank of the Daqing River in the Xinle area for days. The vanguard of the bandits who fled north from Shimen has reached Dongchangshou. The military authorities here have taken strict precautions.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] The communists west of the Xushui Qian River continue to be mobilized and build fortifications horizontally, attempting to attack Xu Cao again. The national army in Gucheng started to sweep south along the line yesterday. According to air force reconnaissance, the communist army in Shijiazhuang is dispersing and fleeing into the Taihang Mountains for reorganization.</p>
<h3>National Army Continues to Sweep Around Xuzhou; No Trace of Bandits on the Xuzhou-Bengbu Line; Air Force Continues to Fly Reconnaissance and Bombing Missions on the Front Line</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 18th] After the national army entered Xiao County on the 17th, it took advantage of the victory to sweep the surrounding areas outside the city. The remnant bandits fled to the southwest, and there is no trace of bandits in the county at present.</p>

He continued, "The Chinese people have always maintained friendly relations with the people of Outer Mongolia. For hundreds of years, Outer Mongolia has been a part of China. However, China is ultimately disappointed in Outer Mongolia's genuine love of peace, because Outer Mongolia's actions in recent months have clearly shown that Outer Mongolia is far from what China hoped for."</p>

<h3>American Newspaper Discusses US Policy Toward China</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page One) He stated: Although in reality, Stilwell was removed from his command in order to keep China fighting against Japan, and although there is ample evidence to prove that the Soviet Union intends to use the Chinese Communists to gain control of all of Asia, American policy remains unchanged. Vance said: The crisis in Sino-American relations at the time of the Stilwell incident arose from the first public attack on the Chinese central government. This situation is still ongoing. At the end of July 1945, the US Army Department ordered the re-appointed General Wedemeyer to review a plan for the US Army to land ten divisions north of the Yangtze River to establish contact with the Communist forces and equip the Communist troops. The proponent of this plan was Stilwell, then commander of the US Tenth Army on Okinawa. Fortunately for China, the war was nearing its end. If this plan had been implemented, it might have handed the lower reaches of the Yangtze River over to the Communist forces, and the red flag would be flying over Nanjing today. Simultaneously with Vance, an article by LaMoore was also published in the Howard newspaper chain. According to the article, in 1944, Marshall fully supported Stilwell in the conflict between Stilwell and Chairman Chiang. He stated: An American officer who had met with Marshall reportedly said that two years later, when Marshall arrived in China with a mission from the US President, he found that former Chief of Staff Marshall's views on Chairman Chiang and his regime were still largely the same as Stilwell's.</p>

First, Minister Thorrend gave a speech in French introducing the development of the Swiss printing industry and its contribution to preserving and continuing European culture. He stated that Switzerland provided a free and democratic environment for talented people during the various European wars and disasters, and that post-war European culture urgently needs to be reorganized, and Switzerland will continue to work hard to contribute. At the end of his speech, Thorrend reported the following statistics on the Swiss printing industry: 1,200 general printing plants, 80 lithography plants, and 22 intaglio photogravure plants, with a total of 21,000 employees. After Thorrend's speech, Zhu Jiahua gave a speech in which he emphasized that the development of Swiss culture and science is almost unimaginable. The country has a population of over 3 million, and there are as many as six universities, each with more than 2,000 students. The printing industry, especially the printing of maps, is particularly famous. Although Switzerland has 25 cantons, and the races and languages are diverse, their spirit of unity is admirable. Switzerland is the most democratic, freest, and happiest country in the world today, and its various industries not only did not suffer from the ravages of war during wartime, but also made brilliant progress. He believed that this exhibition would surely have an impact in China and promote cultural exchange. After Zhu's speech in Chinese, he translated it into German. German, French, and Italian are all very popular in Switzerland. After listening to Zhu's speech, Minister Thorrend and the embassy staff applauded warmly. After the opening ceremony, everyone shared wine and refreshments and had a good time before dispersing.</p>

<h3>Methodist Church Announces 100 Years of Concise History</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Fuzhou 18th Dispatch] According to the concise history announced by the Methodist Church of China, as follows: The Methodist Church was founded by the Englishman John Wesley and later spread to the Americas. In 1783, it separated from the British mother church and established an independent American church, named the Methodist Episcopal Church, meaning those who follow the rules. In 1835, the Wesleyan University decided to establish a Chinese branch plan. On May 15, 1847, the first batch of missionaries, Reverend Collins and Mr. and Mrs. White, came to China from Boston Harbor by sailing ship. After more than 150 days of voyage, they arrived in Fuzhou on September 6 of the same year and established a preaching and medical center in Zhongzhou. The following year, the famous American missionary, Mr. Maclay, came to China and arrived in Fuzhou and selected the True God Church on Caoting Road. Later, the Tian'an Church was built on Cangshan Mountain. Mr. Sun'an of Changle County was the first person to be baptized and join the church. In 1859, missionaries came to China one after another. The first meeting was held in Tian'an Church. In 1886, the first batch of Chinese missionaries, Xu Yangmei and Li Zhenying, began to preach for the church. In 1866, the Fuzhou Preaching Annual Conference was established. The following year, it was expanded and increased various dioceses in Fujian Province, including Fuqing, Xinghua, Yongchun, Jichu, Yanping, and Minqing, and there are also two districts outside the province, Beiping and Jiujiang. In 1872, the Gospel Academy was established in Fuzhou for four years, and the Xunshan Messenger Daily was founded, which was the beginning of the church newspaper in Fujian Province. In 1877, Supervisor White came to Fujian and formally established the Fuzhou Annual Conference and began organizing it. Ten dioceses and one hundred and nineteen pastoral districts were established one after another. The Xinghua Annual Conference established nine dioceses and eighty-one districts.

<h3>Representative Zhang Zizhu to Attend International Trade Conference Flies to America Today En Route to Cuba to Deliver Speech Elaborating on Conference Significance and Our Position</h3>
<p>[From Our City Desk] The International Trade and Employment Conference is scheduled to commence on the 21st in Havana, the capital of Cuba. Our chief representative, Jin Wensi, has already departed from New York to attend. Representative Zhang Fuyun departed from Shanghai on the 15th. Representative Zhang Zizhu (Political Vice Minister of Economic Affairs), along with advisors Liu Pengjiu, Wang Xuelian, specialists Yu Wenhao, Mao Liyu, and secretary Lu Jiuxuan, a party of seven, are scheduled to fly to America via a China National Aviation Corporation plane this afternoon at 4:45 PM, and then proceed to Cuba. On the 18th, Mr. Zhang issued a written statement regarding the significance of the International Trade and Employment Conference and our country's position, as follows:</p>
<p>International trade and international economic issues are of profound significance to the peaceful coexistence of all mankind. Although the causes of the two previous World Wars were very complex, international economic issues were undeniably one of the main reasons. Therefore, the purpose of the former League of Nations and the current Trade and Employment Conference convened in Havana, the capital of Cuba, is to establish norms for international trade through the establishment of an international trade organization, in the hope that countries will engage in trade harmoniously and exchange what they have for what they lack. Although the formal initiation of this Trade and Employment Conference was proposed by the U.S. government at the end of the year before last, its basic principles had already been decided in the Atlantic Charter and the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. All governments have understood that if countries adopt excessive protectionist measures such as tariff barriers, which lead to commercial and economic competition, there will be no hope for universal prosperity in the world economy. The U.S. government, based on established principles, proposed a draft charter for an international trade organization in the spring of last year. The United Nations Economic and Social Council convened meetings in London from October to December last year and in Geneva from April to October this year, with representatives from the U.S., Britain, France, Australia, Belgium, Luxembourg, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, India (including Pakistan in the second meeting), Lebanon, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, and South Africa (the Soviet Union was absent), a total of eighteen countries, holding two preparatory meetings. Our government has participated in both. In principle, our country has always supported international cooperation and actively promoted all systems of international coordination. However, because our country's war of resistance lasted longer than that of any other Allied nation, and the damage we suffered was also the most severe, the issues of economic recovery and reconstruction after the war are particularly serious. While seeking avenues for international cooperation, we must also carefully consider these realities and reserve appropriate space for our future economic development. This position, I believe, will also be understood by friendly nations. The number of participating countries in this Cuban conference is greater than before, and the issues may be more complex. However, our delegation will continue to seek international cooperation while taking into account the economic development of our own country, and continue to negotiate. I also firmly believe that all governments, based on the spirit of coordination, will achieve a satisfactory outcome.</p>
<p>Two UN General Assembly Protocols Signed by Our Representative Zhang Pengchun</p>

In accordance with this resolution, the following two protocols have been formulated: Protocol Amending the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children and the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Adult Women; Protocol Amending the Convention for the Suppression of Obscene Publications. It was also decided that representatives of the member states would sign these protocols at this session of the General Assembly. The signing ceremony will be held on the 11th, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to be forwarded to the National Government, specially appointing Zhang Pengchun as the plenipotentiary representative for signing the respective protocols.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Cherish Your Vote!</h3>
<p>The nationwide general election, which is attracting worldwide attention, will begin on the 21st of this month. The three million voters in our city will also begin voting after the whistle blows at dawn on that day to elect representatives to the National Assembly. This general election is a groundbreaking event in our country's politics, and it is also the first step in our country's implementation of constitutional government. According to the provisions of our new Constitution, the National Assembly is in fact the highest organ of constitutional government in our country, with the power to elect and recall the President and Vice President of the head of state, and the power to amend the fundamental law of the country, the Constitution. Therefore, the responsibility of the first National Assembly under constitutional government is particularly significant. The representatives to the National Assembly will be produced by this general election. Whether the representatives chosen by each voter when casting their sacred vote are appropriate is of great importance to the future of our country's democratic politics. As the Western proverb says, "Be cautious in the initial planning of affairs." A good beginning will make it easy to achieve twice the results with half the effort; conversely, it will lead to half the results with twice the effort. Therefore, on the eve of the time when hundreds of millions of voters across the country will exercise their most sacred right to vote for the first time in the initial period of constitutional government, all parties and factions in the country hope that all voters will cherish their sacred vote, neither abandoning it lightly nor allowing themselves to be manipulated by others. In order to ensure that citizens thoroughly understand the significance of this general election, the authorities in our city are holding a publicity meeting on the eve of the start of voting, so as to explain to citizens the role of the first general election and the methods and procedures for voting. We believe that today's publicity meeting will be of great benefit to the conduct of the general election in our city.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest commercial port in our country, and it is the center of the country in terms of both economy and culture. In this general election, it naturally occupies a very important position, not only attracting international attention, but also every move of its citizens is sufficient to set a precedent for the whole country. Therefore, the atmosphere of the general election in Shanghai can directly and indirectly affect the political climate of the whole country. Looking at the current situation of people from all walks of life in Shanghai running for election, although it cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory, the open and democratic methods adopted by some candidates for election, if emulated by everyone, can establish a good atmosphere for election. What is especially commendable is that in the tide of elections, we have heard that many military and political dignitaries and social notables, because they have other important tasks or social relief undertakings that need them to be responsible for handling, have resolutely given up running for election. This spirit of humility and deference has added a lot of color to this general election.</p>
<p>This general election is still a groundbreaking event in our country's politics, and it is the first attempt for hundreds of millions of voters across the country to vote. As the saying goes, "Climbing high begins from low." We certainly cannot guarantee that the first general election will perfectly achieve the ideal of "selecting the virtuous and capable," but in any case, we ultimately hope that hundreds of millions of voters across the country will be able to especially cherish their sacred vote and ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed. It must be known that citizens giving up voting is equivalent to giving up their right to be masters of the country, and it is also equivalent to failing to fulfill their responsibilities as citizens. Also, if they cast their votes arbitrarily, allow themselves to be manipulated by others, and treat the election as child's play without giving it the slightest consideration, then it is also political immorality. In today's China, since all parties and factions in the country unanimously advocate the implementation of constitutional government, this general election should be held seriously and strive to ensure that public opinion can be expressed. Only the Communist bandits who betray the country and harm the people want to sabotage the general election and prevent the Constitution of the Republic of China from being implemented as scheduled. We hope that the voters of our city, after hearing the whistle at dawn on the 21st, will be able to enthusiastically go to the polling places and cast their most sacred vote, which is responsible to the country.</p>
<p>Secondly, we have repeatedly expressed our opinions to the candidates running for election, and we have also advised them to pay special attention to the cultivation of democratic political ethics. Our country's implementation of constitutional government can be said to be still in the learning stage, and it is especially important to be cautious when holding general elections during this period. In the past few days, the debate over "party nomination" and "free election" has caused widespread discussion across the country. However, the central government still firmly adopted the method of party nomination, and the list of candidates has been announced one after another in the past few days. Although some candidates who failed to be nominated inevitably have grievances, we have always believed that the method of party nomination is the only way to conduct party elections. According to the examples of various democratic countries in Europe and America, parliamentary politics is party politics, and public opinion cannot be expressed without going through political parties. Therefore, party members only know that there is a political party when running for election, and they do not know that there is an individual, and everyone believes that the victory of the political party is the victory of the individual. For example, in the United States, when each state elects members of Congress, the general voters almost do not ask who the candidates are, but ask which party the candidate belongs to. The candidates are also nominated by the political party, and the speeches they give must also be about the policies of the political party, and candidates belonging to the same political party are never allowed to express conflicting views, let alone run freely for election separately. Our country is now also adopting this method, which does not violate democratic principles. Moreover, the Kuomintang and the Democratic Socialist Youth Party have also nominated candidates through consultation, showing mutual humility and support, without any monopoly or domination, which is even more sufficient to demonstrate the spirit of full democracy.</p>
<p>In short, this general election is the first step for the people of our country to exercise the four powers. It is the first attempt, and mistakes are inevitable; but we ultimately hope to reduce them to the minimum. Our requirement for the general voters is that they especially cherish their vote, not give it up, and not cast it randomly; at the same time, we also require the candidates to adopt legal and democratic means to win the support of the voters with their political views and character, and not to bribe with money, let alone intimidate with power; otherwise, election disputes will inevitably emerge one after another. Today is already the 19th. Two days later, when the whistle blows, the voters of the whole city will begin to vote. We hope that hundreds of millions of voters across the country will cherish their vote!</p>

<h3>Truman's Domestic Economic Policy Receives Poor Response from U.S. Congress, Eaton Says Emergency Aid to Europe Plan Discussions Will Be Affected, Taft Insists Aid Should Be Given to Our Country</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 18th] Taft said in a radio address on the 18th, "From the viewpoint of preventing the spread of communism, the aid to Europe plan is necessary. If we do not change our policies in Germany and towards China, then this plan will not be very effective. Apparently, Marshall is unwilling to rescue China from communism at a very reasonable price, but instead allocates tens of billions of dollars to Western Europe." He also said that destroying factories in Germany is contrary to the European recovery plan.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Republican presidential candidate Senator Taft tonight criticized Truman's proposal as "a further step towards complete dictatorship" and said that the president "wants to turn back the clock, wants to return to the wartime period, wants to restore price controls, the wartime Labor Board, and the wartime Production Board. He wants to manage prices to deal with producers, manage wages to deal with workers, restrict the consumption of goods to deal with housewives and restaurants, and various controls to deal with merchants. It is no different from establishing a Federal Administration, sending out hundreds of thousands of special agents to monitor the daily lives of thousands of people."</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 17th] President Truman's thirty-minute speech to Congress today received almost no applause or cheers from the members present. According to House Republican Leader Halleck afterwards, the president said a few days ago that price controls were a method of a police state, but now he himself has put forward such a proposal. This shows the chaos and lack of direction of the government authorities, and the incompetence of the authorities in causing the current domestic situation. The result of implementing price controls in the past was reduced production, induced black markets, and shortages of goods. Congress has other concrete methods that can enable the country to avoid being placed under extreme political machinery. Congress will act in accordance with this policy. European diplomatic circles here have expressed warm welcome to the president's proposal, but they are deeply afraid that opposition to price controls in Congress will hinder consideration of the Marshall Aid to Europe plan. Republican Senator Bowles said: The president seems to want Congress to liquidate America's economic freedom in order to aid Europe. At the same time, the two largest labor unions in the United States, the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the American Federation of Labor, also expressed surprise at Truman's policy of limiting wages to the highest amount. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton said: The president's proposal of a price control plan will shift attention away from the emergency aid to Europe plan, so it is expected that discussions on the foreign aid plan will be delayed.</p>
<h3>US and Greece Establish Joint Chiefs of Staff to Command Suppression of Guerrillas, British Military Police Delegation to Remain in Greece Temporarily</h3>

Tsaldaris's remarks were met with thunderous applause. Prior to this, Tsaldaris had participated in a national defense conference chaired by Prime Minister Sophoulis, and the heads of the British and American military were also present.</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 18th] U.S. Aid to Greece Delegation Chairman Griswold said at a press conference today that under the new plan, U.S. officers in Greece will only act as advisors and liaison officers, with Major General Livsey as Chief of Staff of the advisory group.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] British Foreign Undersecretary Mayhew announced in the House of Commons on the 17th that the British military police delegation will remain in Greece temporarily. Foreign Secretary Bevin believes that there is no guarantee if they withdraw at this time.

<h3>US Searches for Uranium Sand, More than 10,000 Tons Stored</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 17th] The Sunday Express published an article on its front page tonight by science editor Finch, stating that the United States is outbidding uranium sand at a high price of £365 per ton, equivalent to $1,460, in an attempt to hoard most of the world's atomic bomb metal.

<h3>Soviet Air Force Strength More Than Double That of the United States, Announces U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Spaatz stated on the 17th at the President's Air Force Strategy Committee that the Soviet Union is the only country that can threaten the United States, and the number of its first-line aircraft is more than double that of the United States in peacetime.

Spaatz formally announced that the Soviet Union dispatched more than 100 various jet aircraft during the May Day celebrations. Spaatz also said that the development of long-range bombers is becoming increasingly important due to the possession of atomic bombs by another country.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] Representatives of the four major foreign ministers held their seventh meeting in London today, and decided to include the following four items on the agenda of next week's foreign ministers' conference: Report of the Austrian Treaty Committee; the form and scope of the provisional political institutions of Germany; German economic principles; the procedure for preparing a peace treaty with Germany. However, the order in which these four items will be discussed at the foreign ministers' conference has not been agreed upon. Soviet representative Svinov opposed the British, American and French suggestion to include the four-power pact proposed by the United States to prevent German re-aggression on the agenda of the eight foreign ministers' conference, believing that this matter did not need to be included on the agenda and could be decided by the foreign ministers' conference itself. Finally, after repeated urging by the British, American and French representatives, Svinov agreed to record the views of the three countries on this matter in the report that the foreign ministers' representatives submitted to the foreign ministers' conference. The foreign ministers' representatives will discuss the form of this report at tomorrow's meeting.</p>

<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] The U.S. government today announced a major reduction in tariffs in accordance with the Geneva Trade Agreement, reducing the U.S. tariff barriers to the lowest point in decades, benefiting three-quarters of all imported goods. According to the Trade and Tariff Agreement concluded at the Geneva International Conference on October 30, the U.S. tariff reductions should be implemented from January 1 next year, and the other 22 signatory countries will also implement them at the same time.</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress has approved a tariff reduction limit of 50%, and the imported goods that will benefit include copper, cork, lumber, cement, wheat and flour, iron ore, lime, burlap, manganese ore, etc. The import tax on Japanese raw silk has also been reduced from 45% to 25%.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] State Department officials today commented on the Geneva Agreement, calling it an unprecedentedly important document, saying that it is a major step forward in the history of countries eliminating trade barriers with each other. Since World War I, countries have competed to restrict the import of goods from other countries, trying to maintain economic self-sufficiency. This trend has now undergone a major change. France will reduce import duties on U.S. wheat by two-thirds, lard by 59%, and canned fruit by 50%. Most of the 22 signatory countries will reduce import duties on U.S. cars, trucks, motorcycles and their accessories. U.S. electrical materials, radios, electric refrigerators, and office supplies will also enjoy reduced import duties.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, London, 18th] The British government today issued a white paper on the Geneva Trade Agreement, stating that the reduction of preferential tariffs within the British Commonwealth agreed upon at the trade conference does not mean abandoning the important structure of preferential trade within the British Commonwealth. However, according to the Geneva Agreement, the United Kingdom should cancel or reduce preferential tax goods worth £36 million based on the 1938 value.</p>

<h3>Reynaud's Activities Encounter Setbacks</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 18th] Former Prime Minister Reynaud tried hard today to obtain full political support in order to form a new cabinet, but he had a dispute with the left wing of the Socialist Party. If Reynaud's efforts to form a cabinet fail, it is likely that Socialist Blum will take over as Prime Minister, or that the current cabinet will be expanded, with both Reynaud and Blum serving as cabinet members. Political observers firmly believe that no matter what, Reynaud, with his financial reputation, will be the future economic leader of France. It is heard that he assured Blum that in the event of failure, he would be willing to serve in a cabinet led by a veteran member of the right wing of the Socialist Party.</p>
<h3>De Gaulle's Brother Elected Chairman of the Paris City Council</h3>
<p>Communist Party Councillors Walk Out Mid-Session</p>
<p>[United Press Paris, 17th] The Gaullist Popular Republican Movement tonight took control of the Paris city government. The City Council met amid disturbances, and Pierre de Gaulle, brother of De Gaulle, was elected Chairman of the City Council, a position equivalent to Mayor.

<h3>Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi Announces Decision to Expand Government Base, Criticizes Communist Party Actions Hindering Revival</h3>
<p>[Associated Press Rome, 18th] A spokesman for the Christian Democratic Party today confirmed that Prime Minister De Gasperi is expanding his single-party government to include centrist and left-wing parties, but without the Communist Party. According to a report in a Communist Party organ, Togliatti, after De Gasperi's speech on the evening of the 17th, addressed a secret Communist Party meeting in Milan, stating, "If I win the election in March next year, the future can be peaceful, otherwise revolutionary action will be taken, which is an absolutely abstract plan and does not take into account the general development of our actions."</p>
<p>[Reuters Naples, 17th] In a speech at the national congress of the Christian Democratic Party, which he leads, Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi declared that the recent declaration by the Italian Communist Party demanding the overthrow of the government was a declaration of war. De Gasperi stressed, "The government is not a slave of the United States or the Vatican. I am neither a weakling nor a dictator. I will automatically resign after losing the majority support of Parliament, but I solemnly declare my determination not to abandon my post due to revolutionary movements. Italy must participate in the world's revival as a guarantee of peace and democracy. Now some people openly talk about civil war and the development of neo-fascism in Italy, but oppose every action of the government to maintain peace and freedom. The Italian Communist Party, led by Togliatti, and the far-left Socialist Party, led by Nenni, even hoard weapons privately. The disarmament of political parties is necessary. The country dreamed of by Togliatti and Nenni has Stalin's red star."</p>
<p>The Communist Party resolution mentioned by De Gasperi is said to have been issued by the Communist Party Executive Committee. Observers here believe that De Gasperi's statement that the Christian Democratic Party has no intention of governing alone implies that the cabinet will be changed to accommodate left-wing moderates, such as the Socialist Party led by Saragat.</p>

<h3>Liberal Party of Japan Holds Meeting of Parliamentarians, Shigeru Yoshida Decides to Form New Party, Ashida Says Democratic Party Cannot Cooperate</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The Liberal Party held a joint meeting of members of both houses of parliament on the 18th to discuss the issue of a new conservative party. At the meeting, Xingdao Zhiwu, Chairman of the Investigation Committee, said: Now is the time to unite the non-socialist conservative camp. Party leader Shigeru Yoshida continued: The activities of the new conservative party movement must be centered on the Liberal Party, and he hopes to give it active support.

<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] Democratic Party President Ashida, talking about the new conservative party movement, said: The new conservative party must first clarify its position as a ruling party or an opposition party. It is impossible to merge the Democratic Party, which supports the Katayama Cabinet, with the Liberal Party, which is in the position of an opposition party, through this organization. The Democratic Party is watching the movements of the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] Interior Minister Honmura, talking about the new conservative party movement on the 17th, said: Given the level of political awareness of the Japanese people today, it is impossible to create a new conservative party like the two major parties in the United States to operate politics.

<h3>Xu Jizhuang Still Has Not Surrendered, His Wife and Others Suspected of Detention, Bank Director and Car Driver Detained for Further Investigation, Lawyer Zhang Yaoguang Released on Bail After Questioning</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The corruption case against Xu Jizhuang, former Director of the Postal Savings Bureau, is currently being heard in the Criminal Court of the District Court after being prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office. However, Xu has not appeared despite being summoned. The police suddenly arrested Xu's wife, Xu Jinshanru, Cheng Tianru, the managing director of Zhenye Bank, lawyer Zhang Yaoguang, and car driver Cao Mingzhi on the 15th of this month. The development of this case has attracted the attention of the public. According to Sun Yuanfang, director of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Police Bureau, "In this case, the police bureau was entrusted by the court to go to 22 Taishan Road on the 15th to arrest Xu, carrying a court warrant for the arrest of Xu Gangzhuang and a search warrant. Because it was too early, Xu himself was not there. In addition to Xu's wife, there were also Cheng Tianru and the other two. Because this case is of great importance, these four were arrested first, as they are suspected of hiding Xu Jizhuang. The next day was a Sunday, so it was postponed until the afternoon of the 17th when Xu's wife and others were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling on the charge of 'facilitating escape'." According to the reporter's investigation, the case was slightly questioned by Prosecutor Yu Yixin yesterday, and it was decided that a detailed investigation was still needed. Except for Zhang Yaoguang, who was released on bail, the rest were temporarily detained in the Sinan Road Detention Center.</p>
<p>Huang Guangyu, Chief Clerk of the District Court, and Wu Ronglin, the judge in charge of the case, issued a statement to reporters from various newspapers yesterday, saying: "Xu's wife was not transferred to the District Court by the police bureau. The court was completely unaware of the arrest of Xu's wife beforehand, did not entrust the Beijing Bureau to carry out the arrest, and did not send bailiffs to assist the police bureau, because Xu's wife has nothing to do with the postal savings bureau corruption case. The judge in charge did not issue a warrant for the arrest of Xu's wife, because Xu's wife is not a defendant in this case and is not involved in this case. The police bureau's arrest of Xu's wife may be another case. Xu Jizhuang did not surrender to the District Court, but submitted a statement stating the reasons why he could not appear in court for trial."</p>
<p>However, when the reporter inquired of the District Court President Zha Liangjian late last night, he confirmed that apart from lawyer Zhang Yaoguang who had been released on bail, Xu's wife and the other two were indeed in detention. President Zha stated that the statements made by Chief Clerk Huang and Judge Wu were not entirely factual, and that after the entire case had been reviewed today, the details would be released.</p>

<h3>Yang Wendao, Gu Zhuxuan, and Hu Boxiang Successively Withdraw from the Election</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Since Chen Guofu announced his withdrawal from the city candidate, the public has followed suit, and many have also expressed their intention to concede: Yang Wendao, a patriotic figure who suffered ten years of unjust imprisonment due to the Zhongshan Hideuo incident involving Japanese sailors, specially wrote to the Shanghai Election Office yesterday, stating his withdrawal from the National Assembly election, and specially nominated Municipal Council Speaker Pan as a representative of the National Assembly. His original letter is as follows: "I, Wendao, have applied to be a candidate for the Shanghai City Regional Election for the National Assembly Representative. I have previously submitted the nomination and signature book in accordance with the law, requesting registration and publication as a candidate. I have recently learned that the Kuomintang stipulates that party members participating in the election must be nominated by the Party Central Committee. Wendao is a member of the Kuomintang and should follow the instructions of the Central Committee. I hereby specially write to state my withdrawal from the National Assembly Representative qualification. I hope you will take this into consideration and approve it." He also said: "Municipal Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan is an advanced member of our party and is the head of the municipal public opinion organ. He has been nominated by the Central Committee as a candidate for the Shanghai City Regional National Assembly Representative. I will change my request for the support of comrades who are running for my election to unanimously vote for Pan Gongzhan as the Shanghai City National Assembly Representative."</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, who has 200,000 voters in the city, wrote to the election office stating his withdrawal from the National Assembly Representative election. The reporter specially visited Mr. Gu and inquired: "I have been in Shanghai for fifty years, and I have always done my best for local public welfare and the welfare of my fellow villagers. Since the war in northern Jiangsu, the refugees have been wandering. I am deeply saddened by what I have seen. The northeast wind has already started, and the refugees are suffering from hunger and cold. Relief work is even more urgent. I visited the mayor yesterday and there are concrete plans for winter relief and work relief, which need to be carried out urgently. Although I am loved by hundreds of thousands of fellow villagers and brothers and nominated as a candidate for the National Assembly Representative, I weigh the pros and cons and feel that it is more urgent and important to devote my full efforts to the urgent rescue of hundreds of thousands of refugees than to run for my own election. Moreover, the number of places in Shanghai is limited for this election, and there are so many candidates. After careful consideration, I decided to give way to the virtuous and capable. In fact, the obligations to the country and the nation are the same whether in or out of office. Giving up oneself to help others is even more of a contribution to society and fellow villagers. All of this is true, and the motivation is sincere. It is not to be different and attract attention or to fish for fame and praise. I hope that those who know me and love me will understand me."</p>
<p>Hu Boxiang, a well-known industrialist and painter in the city, has been promoting the national products movement all his life, and colleagues in the industrial sector have jointly nominated him as a candidate for the industrial and mining sector of the National Assembly Representative. According to Mr. Hu: "There are many talented people in the industrial sector, and he is very busy with his own affairs. He is also committed to studying art. He did not go through the nomination procedures in advance to formally obtain the qualifications of a candidate, so he withdrew from the election to give way to the virtuous and capable."</p>

<h3>Juvenile Police on Patrol: First Day Impression, Diners Laugh and Talk, Dignity Lost</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] The city's restaurant banquet economy inspection officially began yesterday. The inspection team consists of representatives from the police bureau, the social bureau, the Chinese cuisine industry, the Western cuisine industry, and the kitchen industry association, as well as 25 participating juvenile police officers. The city is divided into five districts: Huangpu, Laozha, Yimiao, Taishan, and Hongkou. Yesterday, the juvenile police encountered some difficulties in the inspection: 1. Representatives from the industry association accompanied the inspection, and the restaurants were prepared in advance. 2. Three diners in a restaurant needed 116,000 yuan to add a scrambled egg. Although it did not exceed the 120,000 yuan limit, the price limit or regulations seem to need further research and modification. 3. Foreign wine is prohibited, but the restaurant removes the foreign labels and mixes it with domestic wine, which is difficult to distinguish. The responsible parties are reviewing these difficulties and are trying to improve them.</p>
<h3>Speaker Continues to Make Campaign Speeches, Appeals for All Refugees, The Fundamental Way to Save Refugees Should Be to Sincerely Implement Constitutional Government</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Report] Municipal Council Speaker Pan visited various preserves in the Yulin District yesterday afternoon. He delivered a campaign speech at Jingzhou Road Elementary School at 3:00 PM, and the audience of more than a thousand people was very enthusiastic. Pan first said: "Since the victorious restoration of the city, the promotion of local autonomy has been going on for two years, and the autonomous organization of district preserves and guards has gradually been completed. However, the current municipal autonomy law has not yet been enacted, and the work of household registration, land administration, roads, guards, and education has not yet reached the ideal standards. City government officials have not yet been elected by the people. Therefore, speaking of the city's autonomy, we must still wait for the continuous promulgation of government laws and the continuous labor of local autonomous personnel. The reason why the autonomy work has not been accelerated is because society has not been stable." The number of refugees coming to Shanghai is estimated to be 200,000, which has formed a serious social security problem in the city. Therefore, I am here today to appeal for all refugees.</p>
<h3>So-Called Refugees Are Not Born</h3>
<p>So-called refugees are not born, but because the communists are making trouble, they cannot live and work in peace in their hometowns, and they have no choice but to leave their homes. They have withdrawn to Shanghai from northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and other places. Therefore, saving refugees should be our common responsibility. The city is currently launching winter relief work, hoping to help the 200,000 refugees who have come to Shanghai to overcome this difficult winter. This is very important, and I hope everyone will contribute. But what I am appealing for is not only this palliative relief. We must further make fundamental attempts to find out the cause of the refugees and use what method to "eliminate the cause of the refugees." Otherwise, refugees will not only come continuously, and it will be impossible to save them all, but even the citizens of Shanghai may become refugees.</p>
<h3>Direct and Indirect Reasons</h3>
<p>There are two reasons for the occurrence of refugees. First, the communists' rebellion. Second, the lack of clarity in politics. If, when the country was victorious, the communists did not rely on their international background to collude with the bandits and rebel, but worked with the government to promote the country's revival, then the country could immediately achieve good governance, and the people's livelihoods could also be stabilized. It is hateful that the communists use brutal or coercive means to deal with the people, but we must also reflect on whether government officials are all clean and self-disciplined, and whether everything they do is "what the people like." Therefore, the direct reason for the occurrence of refugees is the communist rebellion, and the indirect reason is the lack of clarity in politics. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek announced to us that we must both suppress the rebellion and implement the constitution. This is the fundamental way for us to eliminate the cause of refugees. If we want to save refugees and not become refugees ourselves, then we should sincerely implement constitutional government.</p>
<h3>Brief Speech at Chung Cheng Park</h3>
<p>Finally, Chairman Pan explained that the exercise of suffrage is the main key to the nation's implementation of democratic constitutionalism, hoping that citizens will not despise or abandon it, and should cherish their vote. He also stated that he has now been ordered by the Kuomintang Central Committee to be a candidate for Shanghai mayor, because the Central Committee believes that he has served in Shanghai for decades and should be able to gain the trust of local people, and still hopes that Shanghai citizens will elect him based on their care and familiarity. After Mr. Pan finished his speech, he immediately rushed to Chung Cheng Park. In the piercing cold wind, the crowd gathered in the square still numbered over ten thousand. The chairman, seeing that the drizzle was getting heavier, gave only a brief and to-the-point few-minute speech. The audience applauded thunderously, and they began to disperse after a quarter of an hour.

<h3>Supplementary Measures for Conserving Electricity: Tailor Shops Also Receive Preferential Treatment, Similar to Important Fences; Foreigners with Passports Are Not Restricted</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] After the announcement of the measures for conserving electricity in this city, the Public Utilities Bureau, believing that there were still shortcomings, specially drafted supplementary provisions and general rules for the electricity conservation measures, which have been approved by the recent Electricity Supply Review Committee and will be implemented immediately. The full text of the provisions is extracted below:</p>
<p>For those houses with multiple electricity meters installed, if they do not have the same account name, they should be calculated separately.</p>
<p>The user's account name shall be based on the original registered account name. Any transfer of account must be processed after investigation by the company. Except for changes in the type of electricity use, the standard for the quantity of electricity used shall not be changed due to the account transfer application.</p>
<p>The electricity conservation fine has been approved by the Municipal Council and shall be collected at 10% of the public utility surtax.</p>
<p>Reward money will not be paid for fines temporarily, and the handling fee will be decided based on the actual expenses after implementation. The expenses can be paid in installments over several months.</p>
<p>For new users who installed electricity after June 1st of this year but before the implementation of the restriction measures, the limit shall be the highest electricity consumption in the first two months of use. For new users installed after the implementation of the restriction measures, the standard shall be 40 degrees uniformly. In special circumstances, an application can be made to the Electricity Supply Review Committee for an increase.</p>
<p>For those who move, the limit should be transferred along with the move.</p>
<p>Public street lights are not restricted. U.S. military diplomatic groups and UNRRA are not restricted, but they must not use electric stoves. Foreigners with passports shall be treated in the same manner.</p>

If the above-mentioned agencies need to increase due to business expansion, the company shall first investigate and then submit it to the Electricity Supply Review Committee for approval.</p>
<p>For small industrial users whose production is related to electricity use, such as tailor shops, the highest electricity consumption in one year may be used as the limit.</p>
<h3>Leng Shan Submits Defense in Xiao Ling's Suicide Case; Watching Plays and Night Outings Cannot Prove Enticement; Zhang Chunfan Has No Right to Sue</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In the suicide case of Yue opera actress Xiao Dan Gui, Zhang Chunfan, based on Article 1123, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Code, accused Leng Shan of obstructing freedom, enticement, and other crimes in his capacity as the head of the family. It is learned that Leng Shan has drafted a defense statement, pointing out that Zhang Chunfan, after being prosecuted for instigating suicide, was heavily criticized by society and tried to shift the target of public opinion, thus making false accusations in the hope of reducing his own guilt. He also stated that Zhang is Xiao Ling's maternal uncle (as evidenced by the Lao Zha District household registration book), who is a collateral blood relative within the fifth degree of kinship to Xiao Ling, and has no right to sue according to law, requesting dismissal. As for the points accused by Zhang, Leng Shan's defense is as follows:</p>
<p>When "Qin Huai Yue" was staged, Leng Shan was filming the movie "Machine Embroidered Jiangshan" in Suzhou. Leng Shan was not the screenwriter or director of "Qin Huai Yue," as evidenced by the prospectus.</p>
<p>The reason for borrowing the mailbox to communicate with Xiao was that Leng Shan often left Shanghai to film movies. During his departure from Shanghai, he communicated with Cathay actors to discuss theatrical issues, and there was no act of enticement. Zhang cannot provide evidence either.</p>
<p>The indictment mentioned watching plays and night outings, and enticement for adultery. Checking out movies together is common, and it is absurd to use this as evidence of enticement.</p>
<p>As for the phone calls with Xiao, they were even more common. The narrative method in the indictment clearly has the intention of fabricating a trap.</p>
<p>The indictment claimed that Shen Yitao had a secret talk at the request of the defendant a few hours before Xiao's suicide, which is completely unfounded. It is found that Shen and the plaintiff are close friends, while the defendant is not familiar with them. As for the claim that the defendant moved his family to avoid punishment after Xiao's suicide, it is even more fabricated. The defendant has lived in Julu Road for five years and has never moved, as evidenced by his household registration, which is not difficult to verify.</p>
<h3>Percentage Increase in Public Utility Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The price adjustment table for public utilities in this city has been initially reviewed and approved by the Public Utilities Bureau and has been submitted to the National Economic Commission for approval.

<p>Tap Water: British and French tap water companies will increase by 108%, and inland, Zhabei, and Pudong companies will increase by 115%.</p>
<p>Gas: All will increase by 90%.</p>
<p>Telephone: Will increase by 55% to 75%.</p>
<h3>Reason for Sudden Cold Weather: Cold Air Mass Invasion</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] According to the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory yesterday: The climate in this city will become colder today. Yesterday's temperature will drop from 55 degrees Fahrenheit to 51.7 degrees Fahrenheit, and today it may reach 40 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit. The reason for the sudden change in climate is that a Siberian cold air mass has invaded Central China in recent days, causing the sunny and harmonious weather of the past few weeks to change into cold, humid, and overcast weather.</p>
<h3>Charity Horse Racing Actively Underway; General Association Investigates Horses and Jockeys; The Final Problem Lies with the U.S. Military</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Since the Municipal Council passed the Winter Relief Association's proposal to hold a winter charity horse race to raise relief funds, there has been much speculation about whether the horse race can be realized. According to reporters, the matter is actively underway. The Jockey Club, in order to know in detail how many horses are currently available for racing on the member side and how many members are willing to participate as jockeys, yesterday sent a notice to all members with a horse form and a jockey registration form attached, requesting them to fill it out and return it for research. According to people familiar with the horse racing industry, there should be no problem with horses and jockeys if a charity race is held this winter. Although many horses were lost before the war, about one hundred and fifty horses can be collected at present for regular competitions. This number is not difficult, but the level will be slightly worse than before the war. Therefore, whether the horse race can be realized will depend on two other major issues:</p>
<p>Whether the U.S. military can agree to cede a portion of the clubhouse site it has leased. This matter is currently being negotiated with the U.S. military authorities by the municipal government and is the most important prerequisite for realizing the horse race.</p>
<p>The duration of the horse racing season. If a lot of effort is spent on preparing and practicing, and only one or two horse races are held, neither the Jockey Club nor the horse owners will be willing to do so. Conversely, if a horse racing season of three to four months can be given, it is expected that people interested in this field will be enthusiastic about participating.</p>
<h3>Zhang Guizhang Wanted for Embezzling Comfort Money</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] In the case of Zhang Guizhang, the head of the volunteer troop in the Fifth Bao of the Xuhui District of this city, who embezzled and committed fraud during the conscription of volunteer soldiers, the Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau has issued an order to arrest the fugitive. The original order stated: "According to the reports from Mo Jing and Chen Zhili, volunteer soldiers of the Fifth Bao of Xuhui District, Zhang Guizhang, the head of the troop of the Fifth Bao of Xuhui District, forged receipts and embezzled 7 million yuan of comfort money from each of the soldiers. It is requested to investigate the matter. According to the investigation report, Mo Jing and Chen Zhili, two volunteer soldiers of the Fifth Bao of Xuhui District, were introduced by Zhang Guizhang, the head of the troop. It was agreed in advance that the volunteer soldiers' comfort money would be 6 million yuan, plus the 10 million yuan subsidy for resettlement fees from the Municipal Military Service Association. However, it was found that the bao spent 10 million yuan on comfort money for each, while the volunteer soldiers' families only received 5.95 million and 5.85 million yuan respectively, and the money was all collected by Zhang Guizhang, as reported. An arrest warrant should be issued. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is hereby issued to the district chief to instruct his subordinates to investigate, arrest, and send the suspect to be investigated."</p>

<h3>Lianyungang in Hibernation</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Lianyungang, December 12th] After the victory, Lianyungang, Donghai, and Bayun became isolated islands. This mouth of the Longhai Railway has been deserted for a long time. The reporter, feeling the light cold of late autumn, sat on the "automatic express train" that was not powered by coal but by a car engine, from Xinpu to Lianyungang City. I climbed to the top of the mountain, breathed the ocean air, and stepped on this only good port between Shanghai and Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Old Kiln Chisel Mountains and Fill Seas</h3>
<p>Lianyungang was originally a mountainous area by the sea, locally known as Lao Yao. To this day, many foreign merchant ships do not know Lianyungang and only know Lao Yao. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the Longhai Railway Bureau suggested building a port. Thus, in the spring of the 24th year, this desolate Lao Yao began a great project of chiseling mountains and filling seas. Until the outbreak of the war, it already had good construction. As the flames of the Anti-Japanese War spread to Central China, the port personnel of Lianyungang began to evacuate and were ordered to destroy the port facilities. Speaking of this matter, the current Director of the Port Affairs Office, Mr. Yang Xiangian, happily told the reporter: After the destruction, he regretted not being thorough, but thinking about it today, he was fortunate not to have completely destroyed it. Otherwise, how could there be such great strength to resume restoration?</p>
<p>Accompanied by Engineer Hu Zhishi, I visited the pier, where I saw many rusty iron bridges and many broken machines lying on the beach. These are all the relics of the destruction before the war.</p>
<h3>Remains of Three Docks</h3>
<p>During the enemy's occupation, some engineering work was also rebuilt. There are now three docks, all left by the enemy. The first dock is next to the breakwater, with wooden piles underneath. Because there is a small insect in the sea that specializes in eating wood, the wooden piles have rotted over the years. To avoid danger, the port office has removed the first dock. The second and third docks are currently more convenient to use. These two docks are relatively strong, with half of the piles made of cement.</p>
<p>Before the war, Lianyungang's highest annual throughput reached 5 million tons, one-sixth of the throughput of Shanghai Port. Currently, its main task is to export Huai salt. On the day I went, two ships were loading salt, which was being transported to the Anhui area. However, after the opening of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway in the future, Huai salt will not be transported by sea. What business will Lianyungang do then? This is a fear in the heart of the current port office. --Even though the opening of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway still needs to wait for some time. They eagerly hope that the Zhongxing Coal Mine will resume operations as soon as possible, and that the entire Longhai Line will be opened as soon as possible. Lianyungang is still preparing to be the mouth of the Great Northwest.</p>
<p>To the north of Lianyungang, the Linhongkou water carries silt into the sea. Thus, due to the rising tide, a little gift is delivered to Lianyungang every day. The silt that increases daily is enough to bother the port office. There are currently two dredgers tasked with dredging. And the coal needed for these two dredgers is a problem. The day before yesterday, it was finally easy to load 1,000 tons of coal from Taiwan, which temporarily relieved the port office. They could not help but feel a little emotional when they thought of the two coal-turning machines that could transport 400 tons of coal per hour before the war.</p>
<h3>Breakwater and Silt Prevention</h3>
<p>The port of Lianyungang currently has two breakwaters. The first, located in the south, is approximately 1.5 kilometers long. The second, located in the north, is semi-circular and was built by the Japanese, with a length of approximately 3.3 kilometers. However, they only provide breakwater protection and do not prevent silt accumulation. Therefore, under the design of a Dutch engineer, a grand plan was devised. The plan involves constructing a wide breakwater from Xugou directly to Xilian Island, thereby simultaneously preventing waves and silt. Subsequently, the inner side of Xilian Island would be leveled and reclaimed from the sea, with six docks built on both the north and south shores. Additionally, railway tracks would be laid on the northern breakwater to enable direct loading and unloading of goods. While the plan is commendable, current conditions may not permit its implementation. Furthermore, whether the completed construction can be fully utilized remains a question.</p>
<p>Recently, Director Yang informed me that he only desires a simpler plan. First, to raise the southern breakwater because, during high tide, seawater from outside the port can still invade the port. Second, to rebuild the first dock. Third, to complete the second dock, making it entirely of concrete piles. This plan alone requires a budget of over 160 billion. He plans to build ten docks on the southern shore within five years.</p>
<h3>Hope for the Xugou Plain</h3>
<p>Lianyungang is almost entirely mountainous. The few small plains that exist were carved out during the construction of the port, as stones were needed. Therefore, future urban development is unlikely. Only Xugou, to the north, is a large plain and still offers hope. After the victory, due to the presence of bandits, Suyun City became an isolated island. The railway was not open, and the Xuhai Highway was washed out. Restoration of traffic only occurred at the end of last month, and the traffic is still dominated by military vehicles. Few ships come from Shanghai. Rice sells for 1.8 million per 320 jin, and Qingdao merchants are also collecting goods here. Other items, such as cigarettes, are at least twice as expensive as in other parts of northern Jiangsu. Newspapers from Beijing and Shanghai are transferred from Qingdao, arriving approximately once every week or two. Consequently, news becomes history.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau Takes Over the Port</h3>
<p>The reporter went to visit the municipal government, but the mayor had gone to Shanghai, and the secretary had strolled off to Xuzhou. The people of the Lianyungang municipal government also felt frustrated. They said that, according to regulations, the port should be managed by the municipal government. Now it is managed by the Railway Bureau, so the Port Affairs Bureau cannot be established, and there is no discussion of any construction.</p>
<p>In addition, during his inspection in Suyun Port, Zhang Xiang, the head of the Huaihai Pacification Area Inspection Group, received an anonymous letter of accusation. It alleged that the mayor has four wives, etc., and listed three major charges. However, these are matters outside the main topic. Looking to the future, "National construction relies on the Northwest." As long as transportation is restored, Lianyungang still has a bright future, just like the bright and beautiful picture of white seagulls flying up and down on the azure sea. (Special correspondent Ling Songsheng)</p>
<h3>Refugees Talk About the Recent Situation in Yancheng</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Zhenjiang on the 18th] After the strengthening of the National Army's strength in northern Jiangsu, the remnant bandits in the corner of Yancheng felt panic. Therefore, the atrocities of oppressing the people and plundering materials have become more active. According to refugees who recently escaped from Yancheng: The Communists are strengthening the so-called anti-espionage work in various towns and villages in Fu, issuing red, yellow, blue, and white armbands. Those who are considered loyal to the Communist ideology are allowed to wear red armbands, the poor and the yellow, etc. are allowed to use yellow, those who are similar to homeless ruffians are limited to yellow, and those who do not side with the bandits are forced to wrap themselves in white cloth and are limited to a year of solitary confinement. They are not allowed to go out, and anyone can openly kill them. This abusive policy is euphemistically called "people's prison" by the bandits.</p>
<h3>The Three Counties of Chu, Cheng and Tong Establish a Joint Defense and Suppression Office in the Sandy Area</h3>

All self-defense team police in the area will be under command during the winter defense period, and will be concentrated from time to time, or sent out in batches to jointly suppress bandits, set up telephone networks between districts and villages, and organize a relay station. Completion is limited to half a month.</p>
<h3>The Cheng County Temple of Confucius Will Be Repaired</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper in Jiangyin on the 16th] This county's Temple of Confucius has not been damaged since its renovation in the Qianlong Renshu year of the Qing Dynasty. Since it was captured by Japanese invaders in the 26th year, it has been almost completely demolished in eight years. The Dacheng Hall, the Sage Teacher, the Four Sages, the two seats in the east and west, and the wood tablet of the seventy-two disciples have all been used as fuel, and the sacrificial vessels have been depleted. It has become a ruined wall and there is no one to manage it. On the 15th, Jiang Yuzong, the principal of the county middle school, and others convened a meeting of various agencies to organize a committee to repair the Temple of Confucius, inviting merchants to estimate the price for repairs. The original Temple of Confucius's field property lease letter was transferred to the county committee as repair funds.</p>

Tenure is divided into the following five stages: Stage 1: one year or less; Stage 2: one year; Stage 3: two years; Stage 4: four years; Stage 5: indefinite. The tenure stage system applies to teachers who are registered or certified as qualified, and is limited to those who have served continuously in the same school.

The first stage of tenure is a probationary period. Those whose service performance is poor during the probationary period may be dismissed at any time. From the second stage onwards, it is a formal employment period. Teachers who have been formally employed and whose service is not diligent and performance is second-best may not be promoted at the end of their tenure. Those who have committed serious misconduct may be dismissed at any time. The change of tenure stage shall take place at the beginning of the school year. The principal shall fill out a roster one month in advance, sign and note opinions, and submit it to the Bureau for approval along with all relevant documents and certificates. The format of the roster will be determined separately. For those who have served continuously in a school before the implementation of these measures, starting from the victory of the recovery, if the validity period of the previously issued appointment letter does not expire at the end of the school year, it may be extended until the end of the school year, except for those who have been dismissed.

<h3>Badminton League Registration Starts Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Badminton in this city has become a popular sport due to the vigorous promotion of the Badminton Committee of the Municipal Sports Association. In last year's league and open tournaments, not only was the participation very enthusiastic, but the skills were also excellent. In particular, badminton is similar in nature to tennis. Those who are good at tennis must also be good at badminton, and those who are good at badminton are often tennis players. The timing of the two ball games is just enough to achieve mutual preparation and promote ball skills.</p>
<p>This year's Badminton Committee is presided over by Xi Yuyi, Cai Qi, Pan Youyuan, Rong Deqi, Li Guoyao, and foreigners Lin Xuekang and Tao Peng. They have already started promoting it. Registration for this season's team league is scheduled to begin in early December. Teams such as the Sports Federation, which is full of talents, and the American Public School, which has excellent facilities, have many excellent players. In addition, the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce, the Columbia Association, the American Association, and other foreign groups are well-trained in badminton. It is expected that the competition will be even more intense in the future. A women's group will be formed this year, but it seems difficult for Chinese women to form independent teams. Most of them will be the targets of competition for foreign women. The Sports Federation and the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce have the strongest lineups.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tennis Club has built two indoor courts to promote badminton, which will be completed soon. The ground is being repaired these days. The establishment of this court will provide a place for badminton enthusiasts to practice and will greatly help promote the badminton skills of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Registration will be sent to last year's participating teams and schools in this city starting tomorrow. The committee has borrowed the Municipal Stadium and set up three courts, which have been painted and completed, which is enough for the league and future open tournaments, so there is no problem with the venue.</p>
<p>The league is divided into Group A, Group B, and the Women's Group. The champion of Group A last year was won by the Chinese team led by Pan Youyuan, and Group B was won by Yucai. There will be more teams participating this season than last year, especially many foreign teams.</p>

<h3>Chinese Stocks Plunge Mid-Session, Rebounding Remarkably Near Closing</h3>

<h3>British Exchange Rate Rises Another 6,000</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Foreign exchange rates were slightly changed yesterday. The US exchange rate remained at $59,5000, unchanged. The British exchange rate was $188,000, up $6,000. The Hong Kong exchange rate was $11,701.04, up $373.44. The Indian exchange rate was $14,075.52, up $749.20.</p>
<p>[Another Report] The British pound, Hong Kong dollar, and Indian rupee have been adjusted and increased several times in a row, which proves that the government has launched large-scale trade with the British pound area. Recently, a large amount of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and other products from our country have been shipped to the British pound area, and they are very popular among the local residents. Currently, the domestic production is not enough. If the production is increased, and domestic sales are further reduced, and exports are increased, it will help the government absorb a portion of foreign exchange to balance the income and expenditure of the Foreign Exchange Fund. The US exchange rate has been quite stable recently. General import and export merchants and others who hold foreign exchange are taking a wait-and-see attitude, believing that the government will open up free foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>Dyeing and Weaving Factories and Merchant Guilds Absorb Yarn and Cloth, Creating New High Prices; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Yarn Rises Another 2.8 Million</h3>

At the close, yarn prices reached new highs. Finally, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn soared to 43.6 million, a sharp increase of 2.8 million compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn continued to rise by 890,000 to 1.78 million.</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market was stimulated by the influx of floating capital into Shanghai and the loose credit of merchant guilds. The market saw bullish sentiment. Industry players, in view of the situation, aggressively covered short positions. 12-pound faucet and other grades of fine cloth once again created unprecedented high prices, seeing sharp increases ranging from 50,000 to 105,000 yuan compared to the previous day. About 30 to 40 pieces were traded. Serge saw a large number of chips, and trading was smooth, rising by 35,000 yuan. The prices of other cloths also mostly trended firm.</p>
<h3>Tong Jiling, Deputy Director of the Textile Adjustment Committee, Takes Office; Promoting Joint Distribution Requires Government-Business Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Tong Jiling, Deputy Director of the Textile Adjustment Committee, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and took office in the afternoon. Regarding the joint distribution of cotton yarn, he told reporters that the government authorities attach great importance to it, believing that if yarn factories can cooperate with the government, the implementation of joint distribution will be promoted smoothly, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve results. Therefore, the government authorities have accepted and considered the eight opinions proposed by the Textile Association. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has hired experts to study them and will submit them to the full economic meeting this Thursday for discussion and decision, and then submit them to the Executive Yuan for review and decision before implementation. As for the pricing of cotton yarn and cloth, cotton has already begun to be implemented, and yarn and cloth can be resolved smoothly after the joint distribution method is determined. The association can also accept and consider the yarn merchants' request for yarn allocation. As for the detailed methods, they can also be resolved smoothly after the entire joint distribution method is determined. In addition, the committee may adopt the request of the replication industry to participate in the Cotton Yarn Allocation Committee in the future.</p>

<h3>The National Bank Authorities Say That the Rumors of 50,000 Yuan Banknotes Are Completely Absurd</h3>
<p>["United" Credit News] There have been rumors in the market recently about the issuance of 50,000 yuan banknotes, which has affected some commodity prices. According to a responsible person at the Central Bank, this is another absurd rumor. As of today, there has been no news about the issuance or non-issuance of large banknotes. Under the current economic situation and the situation of the Communist bandits creating chaos, coupled with the fact that the US loan has not yet been specifically decided, rumors have become a tool for speculators. It is still hoped that legitimate businessmen will not be misled.</p>
<h3>The Arrival and Sales of Rice Are Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of 20,800 shi of rice arrived in the north and south markets.

<p>Yesterday, the rayon market continued its upward trajectory. The 120s, 1A, "Xu" character, with luster, immediately jumped over the 100 million yuan mark, reaching an additional 3 million yuan. However, due to the excessive price, few inquired. It once dropped to 1 million yuan with a transaction. At noon, the asking price remained at 3 million yuan. In the afternoon, it slightly weakened, with the final asking price at 2 million yuan, still 500,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The price of 4A Cambodian silk stood around 95 million yuan.</p>
<p>Factory Silk</p>
<p>The market was thriving yesterday, boosted by the high price of rayon, which invigorated people's spirits. The asking prices for all grades of five-dan head silk were generally 4 million to 5 million yuan higher than the previous day. Medium-grade additional dan silk was traded at 70 million yuan, and high-grade additional dan silk was traded at 72 million yuan. Tiger stove silk was also traded at 66 million yuan. The price increase for dried spun silk was slower yesterday, with special grade additional dan silk priced at around 51 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Tung Oil and Pig Bristles in Demand</h3>

However, the market price is 1.6 million yuan. Adding transportation costs of 1 million yuan, the purchase price in Shanghai indicates significant losses for exported tung oil, making it increasingly difficult. Consequently, the Hong Kong market is performing well, with London barrel oil at £205 per long ton C&amp;F. According to pig bristle merchants speaking to reporters yesterday, the current prices for various grades of pig bristles are: Tianjin improved #55 at 38 million yuan per customs dan, #26 at 31 million yuan, Chongqing bristles (Yu price) at 18.5 million yuan, Shanghai bristles at 16 million yuan, and no market for Hankou bristles.

<p>The Textile Monthly, published by the China Textile Institute, has been revamped in terms of content, starting with volume 8, issue 26. This issue is a special edition on the China Textile Machinery Company and includes multiple articles on domestically produced textile machinery.</p>
<p>Correction</p>
<p>A letter from the United Credit Information Service states: Upon review, the news released by this office on the 17th, "Rumors of Foreign Exchange Balancing Committee's Dissolution are Inaccurate," omitted the phrase "according to a certain economic authority" under the section "no changes whatsoever." Furthermore, "Mr. So-and-so" was mistakenly written as "Mr. Shen." Please correct accordingly.</p>

<h3>On the Moving Quality of Literary and Artistic Works</h3>
<p>— Feng Lai</p>
<p>"The real story is within the cover of a book, not so much in the reader's heart." This is a maxim by English literary critic, V.S. Pritchett.</p>
<p>Pritchett means that people read literary works not mainly for perfect structure, beautiful sentences, or imaginative imagery, but to find themselves in the works, discover their own souls, awaken hidden thoughts, illuminate vague hopes in life, memories, or all sad and sweet beliefs and experiences. In other words, every reader has his own life, which, though ordinary, is real, and especially intimate. Therefore, for the vast majority of readers, their own "story in the heart" will far surpass the story "within the cover of a book," far surpass all the changes, twists, and turns of written expression. -- In the end, why do people still read literary and artistic works? This is because people are often confused about their own thoughts, consciousness, and feelings. It is most difficult for people to understand their own mental state and seek a kind of guidance, stimulation, or even reshaping and creative inspiration. How will the mediocre heart be purified? How will the lofty heart be clarified? How will the impetuous one think deeply? How will the desolate one be warmed? How will the weak one be strengthened? How will the ignorant one be wise? How will the noisy world be renewed? Where is the perplexed century heading? Seeking common ground with similar minds, we can build good spirits together, change and sublimate, and eliminate bad ideas...; "Art is the expression of life," therefore, people read books. "Milton is loved by men, Dante is loved by women, young people love Byron, middle-aged people love Wordsworth. People feel alive when they read literary works, just like when one is attacked by sleep and one's hand touches one's knee and finds oneself alive." What this literary theorist said is not wrong. People all crave to discover the true self; -- human nature alone can be moved by this, because the "true" self is actually the eternal character of mankind, the "Greater Self" of the universe, the "humanity" that everyone sees. -- What people look up to in literary and artistic works is to find their own inner emotions from the sensibility of the work, to the world, to the times, and to life, to find life, to review or create the light of the soul, and to lead out more true stories from the depths of the heart from a moving story in the book.</p>
<p>Therefore, Romain Rolland testified: "The value of words depends entirely on the soul they express."</p>
<p>Writing this far, we can clearly understand that a good literary work is a work that can most gratifyingly arouse the greatest resonance in the reader's deep heart, and allow the reader to most intimately experience life and "the truth of life," that is, the first element of the work. How much "moving quality" there is is the key to the human significance and social value of the work, and it is only with this quality that a work can greatly move readers, and only then can it have meaning.</p>
<p>The answer is also very simple, returning to the origin must be true and intimate.</p>
<p>These two include the problem of writing attitude and writing skills, which determine the quality of the work. The style of the work may be different for everyone, but all rivers flow into the sea. There has never been a work that is not true or intimate that can move people's hearts, whether it is ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign.</p>
<p>First, please consider the "truth" of the work: "Even for the throne, never deceive the truth." This motto of Beethoven is worth remembering. Do not fabricate lies, do not create something out of nothing. A writer must go deep, practice, seek truth, and write truthfully. Taking materials from life and life, the brilliance of facts is better than everything. In a complex world, a dazzling era, with thousands of years of human culture in the past and infinite future ahead, under such a great scene, can't our writers write something universal, immortal, and profound? Carlyle, when discussing the poet Burns, once said that his most important representative advantage was "sincerity"; yes, to be sincerely faithful to humanity, life, the inspiring process of human progress, and the eternal virtues of people, to be faithful to writing, the works written can move people.</p>
<p>Balzac writes about French society, Goethe writes about passion, Du Fu writes about turmoil, Li Qingzhao writes about the desolate scene of "the curtain rolling up the west wind," Maupassant writes about the sorrows and joys of the petty bourgeoisie, ... these are all true and concretely touching. It is ridiculous to groan without illness, and artificial fake flowers can never reveal natural fragrance. Although it is not necessary to experience it personally, you should at least use your eyes, ears, thoughts, and heart to experience, understand, or appreciate the works that will be written by you.</p>
<p>Speaking of "intimacy": Since literary and artistic works mainly go to move readers, the soul must resonate, and emotions must converge. Of course, it is impossible to be rigid and unfamiliar in expression and perception. Emerson once said: "Everything that Shakespeare says about kings, every boy reading in the corner feels is true for himself." This sentence truly explains why Shakespeare was able to become a world literary giant and speaks to the psychology of thousands and millions of readers in the world. Because no matter when, where, or who, there is always a kind of contradictory emotion in the heart that is often the same, subtly changing in concealment and eager to explode. A good work must be able to assist, sublimate, and reasonably harmonize this contradictory emotion, but this must have an intimate writing style that makes readers feel related to the writing of sorrow and joy to achieve its effect. People sometimes want to cry, sometimes want to laugh, sometimes have a longing for success, sometimes have unspeakable depression, or may also hide pure tears and mysterious hatred and love, always hoping to find a confidant in a distant land. One day, if they get it, get it in a beautiful literary work, the lines are filled with gentle and warm feelings, and they find the shadow of the soul, then, for a kind and sincere reader, feeling that they are not alone and desolate in the world, and that there is still a precious heart-to-heart connection, how grateful and moved they will be!</p>
<p>The perseverance in the biographies of Beethoven or Michelangelo; the strong personality of "Manon"; the bitter love of "La Traviata"; the tranquility and naturalness of Tao Yuanming's poems; the mediocrity and stupidity of the poor people in Zola's novels; the wit and ingenuity in Shaw's plays; the heroism of the life-long enterprising heart in "Jean-Christophe";... all of this, all rely on the feeling of intimacy, so that countless readers in the world, together with it, feel bored, sigh, realize, struggle, and cheer; and from this, they obtain a spirit that transcends the individual, move forward, and obtain an unprecedented spiritual progress, and obtain a piece of light.</p>
<p>In this way, readers obtain "more, more stories," wisdom, and emotions that are not only beyond the cover of the book, but also beyond what was originally in the heart.</p>
<p>What's more, true works are particularly easy to appear intimate, and intimate works are often true. These two are mutually cause and effect, mutually corroborate each other, and lead to the same destination through different paths; together they form the great path of writing. Because the truth of mankind does not change, the spirit of the universe remains the same, life, life, human nature, and other immortal themes will always be true, intimate, and always able to move people in an excellent and beautiful work.</p>
<p>A work that can always move people is like a radiant gemstone, shining in all time and space!</p>
<p>Let me borrow Lamartine's words to end this article:</p>
<p>"To know how to move people is to know everything."</p>

<p>There is no sunlight, and mildew gnaws at people's souls. So: I place my hope on that purple door.</p>
<p>"The door should be opened!" I thought: "When the door opens, a large bunch of purple lilacs will squeeze in, and a god with white wings will stand smiling by the door, and the cabin will be filled with fragrance."</p>
<p>"When the door opens, outside is a blue sky, free wind, gentle rain, sunlight paints flower shadows, and raindrops are like thousands of silver arrows shooting towards the ground."</p>
<p>I slowly walked to the door, the purple door was covered with shiny iron barbs, the door, solemn and majestic, faced me.</p>
<p>At the door, I heard screams and cries again, and I smelled the fishy stench of decaying animals again.</p>
<p>"Gentle rain, free wind." I thought.</p>
<p>I kicked the door with trembling feet.</p>
<p>A clanging sound of metal rang out outside the door, someone added a lock to the door again.</p>
<p>I left the door in fear; but outside the door there is gentle rain and free wind.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I showed strength to the door, I handed over my whole life to the door.</p>
<p>I am dancing in the free wilderness, I see millions of people like me lying by the door.</p>
<p>"The door should be opened!" I thought:</p>
<h3>An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>I nodded again, as a reply. In fact, I am a complete outsider to the ancient and almost lost art of "whistling." Not only do I not understand what the timbre of whistling is, I have never heard it before; is it like the sound of a flute, or a trumpet, or the whistle played by Ruan Xiaoqi?</p>
<p>The reason why I nodded to indicate understanding was partly to encourage Yaoqun to continue speaking, and partly because I did imagine two sounds: one was the sound of the waves on a quiet seaside night, and the other was the wind whistling through a pine forest. At the moment, I would treat them as whistling sounds. If I had to point out another one, it would be the whooshing ghost cries of the north wind piercing through the crevices.</p>
<p>When Yaoqun saw that I nodded to the second point as well, she could not help but be a little surprised, and seemed very happy: "Good, then we can solve the problem! ... You know, according to the ancient whistling score, there are fifteen kinds of vocalization methods. Except for the three kinds of mind whistling, intention whistling, and god whistling, which are too mystical, we can learn the remaining twelve kinds well. Among these twelve kinds, there are three kinds that belong to throat vocalization, called "small sink" and "big sink," which are especially suitable for our ideals; because this kind of whistling sound is extremely subtle when heard nearby, but extremely clear at a considerable distance. ..." When Yaoqun said this, she paused again, her two eyes emitting a flashing glow, as if she wanted to find an affirmative answer on my face.</p>
<p>As for me, in order to hear her continue speaking, even though I was really bewildered in my heart, I tried my best to put on a look of understanding on my face.</p>
<p>"I mixed the two vocalization principles of shortwave flute and throat sound, and as a result, I got a kind of "semi-long wave"—this is a term I made up—vocalization method. I used the lips, teeth, tongue, and throat, according to the ideal mechanical form of shortwave flute and "throat whistling," forced the vocal cords tightly, and issued a "chih" sound. Although this "chih" sound can also be heard nearby, it is especially loud at a distance; the empty range is about two miles, and it can reach the focal point. Therefore, in flat areas, you can play the sound casually, but in mountainous areas, you have to raise your head and whistle into the air."</p>
<p>"Then, why couldn't I hear it just now?" I could not help but persist in this stupid and almost foolish question.</p>
<p>"There are probably two reasons for this:" Yaoqun breathed a sigh of relief, relaxing her strained spirit: "First, you were probably concentrating on other issues, and you have never heard this kind of whistling sound before, so naturally you couldn't hear it; even if you heard it, because it was mixed with other sounds, you probably couldn't distinguish it. The second reason is that this place is at least two miles away from where Mr. Shen is making the sound, and it is also a mountainous area. What we can hear is probably just some aftersounds. You have to practice hard and have extremely sharp ears to hear some of it. Tiger Brother, you know, his senses are sharp and bright, and seem to be extraordinary... I didn't even hear the first alarm."</p>
<p>"Hey!" I breathed a sigh of relief, while stretching my attention, I was amazed at the complex reasons in it. At the same time, I remembered that Yaoqun had just said that the sound made by the Big Fool was "second degree," indicating that there was no danger, so I asked Yaoqun again: "What does 'second degree' mean?"</p>
<p>"Oh," a playful expression suddenly appeared on Yaoqun's face, as if she was preparing to make fun of me, but she immediately corrected her expression; "You were probably so focused on this sound transmission thing that you forgot about our echo in the empty valley and the code method! ... But there are only "three degrees" to this kind of sound transmission—we made them up too—one long tone plus one short tone is the first degree, indicating that we are inquiring about each other's whereabouts, greeting each other, and so on. The second degree; two long dragging tones, indicating a call for help, but not urgent. The third degree; one long tone plus three or four short tones, repeating continuously, indicating danger... The other party's response is the same..."</p>
<h3>Preface to the Tang Shixia Da Ding Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Pan Boying</p>
<p>There are two kinds of causes, inner and outer, for painting and calligraphy, just like the theory of Taiji's two forms. The difference between paper and silk, the division of brush and ink, the schools of North and South, the distinction between meticulous brushwork and freehand, and the depth of the author's skill are all due to external causes. As for the dullness or sharpness of the root nature, the fortune or misfortune of the encounter, and thus the feeling in the heart and the expression in the writing, are all due to inner causes. Xie He first discussed the Six Principles and regarded "Qi Yun Sheng Dong" (spirit resonance, life-movement) as the guideline. This is to combine the two causes, inner and outer, for discussion. The root nature is bestowed by heaven, and the encounter is due to the world. What is created in prosperous times is mostly magnificent and grand, and what is created in declining times is mostly strange and transformed. Especially at the time of political changes, the strange changes in the world are even greater, and the expression of the Six Principles is even more obvious. There is no need to talk about ancient times. Yi Zhai, Song Xue, Ba Da, and Shi Tao were all grandsons of the defeated kingdom and masters of the new dynasty. By the time the Qing Dynasty was established and the Republic of China was founded, the situation was very different from the previous era. This is because the political changes before the abdication of the Qing Dynasty were only limited to the change of the imperial family's surname. The rise of the Republic of China was the initial basis of democracy and the creation of a precedent in national history. Speaking of the cause of the five races as one family, the abdication of the Qing Emperor also contributed to it. Therefore, the grandsons and clan members of the Qing Dynasty were not subject to the calamity of cutting grass and uprooting weeds, and had abundant wealth. Those who had enough literary talent to shine were also able to obtain the name of hermits and occupy seats in the deliberations, such as the brothers Pu Xueshai and Xinfan, who were especially respected by the world.</p>
<p>Here is someone who possesses an unparalleled spiritual heart and is endowed with the beautiful virtue of self-cultivation. Born into a noble family, she became a concubine to a close relative. With her outstanding talent, she first advocated participation in politics in Shanghai, but was secretly rejected by Yikuang. It was her father who was rejected. With her gentle and bright quality, she tried her best to assist in the new policies of Emperor Dezong, but she was strangled by Nara. It was her aunt who was strangled. This person is Ms. Tang Shixia. At the beginning of the Japanese invasion, Ms. Tang knew that the events of Shi Jingtang and Zhang Bangchang would reappear in Ling. Fearing the connection of thatch roots, she traveled south incognito and resolutely cut off ties. She lived in seclusion in Songpu, abandoning the world. In her spare time, she found comfort in painting. Time passed by, and fifteen years have passed. Her paintings originate from Ma Xia, and her mind is the same as the ancestral law. Her paintings are elegant and precious, and also draw on the styles of Li Sixun and Li Zhaodao, which are not comparable to Ma Xia's remaining water and broken mountains. Furthermore, the method of the Northern School was transformed by Tang Ziwei with fine brushes, and a new realm was opened. The feud between literature and art is not far from taking lessons. Since the Ming Dynasty, there has never been a master of the Northern School who has not also drawn on the Southern School. Therefore, the Northern School of later generations is not like Ma Xia's great wheel and clumsy cart. The style of her delicate and exquisite style is also seen in Ms. Tang's paintings. With the encounters of Song Xue and Shi Tao, she appeared in the body of a woman. With the style of Xia Gui and Ma Yuan, she came from the hands of weaving and inheriting. With the shameless actions of Shi Jingtang and Zhang Bangchang, she was naturally detached from the outside world. It can be asserted that her paintings will surely be passed down. And those who have a true appreciation of art will surely not abandon them like this, and it can also be asserted.</p>
<p>Recently, Ms. Tang is going to display her books at the Chinese Painting Gallery to introduce them to connoisseurs in Shanghai. In advance, she sent invitations to various celebrities to comment on them. Not despising my humble self, I was also honored to be among them. Alas. My family and Ms. Tang's father's family had a long-standing elegant friendship. When I was young, I often had the honor of receiving teachings from her respected father. With a high-spirited song, he called it a friendship that transcends age. I once saw Ms. Tang at a family celebration banquet, when she was not yet of hairpin age. She was dignified, virtuous, and elegant, with a majestic demeanor. She was like a noble princess of the imperial family. Now, when we meet again, the world is in constant turmoil. However, Ms. Tang is as upright as a bamboo, and her sacred beauty is even clearer. My feelings of joy and sorrow, how can they be expressed? I then thought of Huang Luzhi's aunt, Madam Li, Zhao Ziang's wife, Madam Guan, and even in modern times, Qian Chenqun's mother, Chen Shu, Yun Shouping's niece, Qing Yu, all of whom are immortal people. I am now able to see the reincarnation of Li, Guan, Chen, and Yun, and the glory of the noble princess is far beyond comparison. Therefore, the inspiration from the family and country, and the meaning implied in painting, is exactly in line with the meaning of the inner and outer causes that I have stated, and it is also in harmony with her natural endowment. Therefore, I forget my ugliness and am happy to write this preface for her. Written by Ji Yu, a scholar from the Zanyuzhai, after the Beginning of Winter in the Dinghai year.</p>
<h3>Steep Ravines and Dense Trees</h3>
<p>— Shi Chongpeng</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Talking About Phlegm</h3>
<p>— Also Said</p>
<p>"Spitting phlegm into a spittoon" is a common sight everywhere; but does that mean there's no phlegm without a spittoon? This statement cannot be established. For example, when eating, everyone says to use a rice bowl. When the words "rice bowl" are mentioned, a bowl of moderate size, piled high, white, loose, and steaming, that is a container for rice, immediately comes to mind. But is it impossible to eat without this rice bowl? This statement cannot be established, at the very least, just as spitting phlegm doesn't necessarily require a spittoon, it's that simple.</p>
<p>Have you seen someone eating hand-grasped rice? Of course, you have. Have you ever seen someone using newspapers to hold rice? Perhaps, because you don't often come to the streets, you haven't seen this wonderful scene. In fact, it's common for street wanderers, clutching their lunch bundles, grabbing cold rice, and using a corner of newspaper casually picked up from the ground to wrap the precious grains of rice.</p>
<p>By analogy, requiring a spittoon to spit phlegm is not only polite and elegant but also something that can be achieved by those who are well-fed and relatively refined. Don't underestimate the spittoon; some households don't have mahjong tiles, but few lack a spittoon. Moreover, in wealthy and palatial halls, able to compete with rosewood furniture, ancient bronzes, calligraphy and paintings by famous people, and brocade curtains, is only the tall, knee-high, polished bright, and heavy, snow-white large copper spittoon.</p>
<p>As for offices, public places, and even temples and monasteries... wherever people go, spittoons can always be found. Some call a vulgar phrase in our folk language "the national curse." If we were to speak reasonably, it seems that the spittoon could also be called "the national utensil," right? Why is there so much phlegm among the people of this country? Alas!</p>
<p>The history of phlegm is also very long. In medical books, there are terms like phlegm asthma, phlegm fire, phlegm syncope, phlegm retention, etc., and the phrase "phlegm obscures the mind" is especially well-known, because it can be followed by "incoherent speech." Phlegm is really a bad thing; phlegm surge and phlegm blockage can lead to death. People with pulmonary tuberculosis often have bacteria in their phlegm, and spitting it on the ground can easily cause infection, which is especially terrible. However, the so-called "cloud covering the moon" sound emanating from the back of the head, combining firmness and gentleness into a pleasing sound, is used skillfully by Old Tan when singing opera, and it is said that it benefits from a portion of the phlegm sound. Perhaps this is the only aesthetic and appreciative aspect of phlegm.</p>
<p>Phlegm is dirty. When writing this word, even the tip of the pen feels greasy and disgusting, let alone seeing mouthfuls of it all over the place. Therefore, other things can be made of transparent materials, but the glass spittoon seems to have not yet appeared in this "plastic" era. Unless, as legend has it, Li Hongzhang, when he was an envoy to Russia, once borrowed a tall-stemmed glass wine glass at a banquet because he was old and had a lot of phlegm and couldn't cope in time. As for ordinary people, even their own phlegm, I'm afraid no one would want to display their true form in a transparent glass container.</p>
<p>On the incense tables in temples, small porcelain spittoons can often be found. It's not surprising that slender, delicate women like Daiyu regard them as companions. On the other hand, gentlemen with heads held high and striding confidently stretch their necks, make a sound in their throats, and cough and spit out that mouthful of phlegm with unparalleled ease. At this time, the question arises: spittoon? Floor? Or the street? "No spitting" means that besides spittoons, handkerchiefs, and paper, which can accept this honored guest, other occasions are prohibited, and the words "anywhere" must be corrected.</p>
<p>People over forty, fake cough, real spit, it's not accidental. One is posturing, and the other is forced. The higher a person's position and status, the better the environment, the more unnatural coughs there are. Conversely, those who are undernourished, of low status, and mentally listless, although they don't cough, have phlegm surging like a tide, with an unstoppable momentum. Therefore, coughing is not necessarily a problem. Adults and gentlemen often use it as a decoration to show their status. Its effect is like walking in leather shoes, the sound of shoes rustling does not necessarily symbolize a strong body but indicates his important position. As for phlegm as a product of poverty and weakness, it is generally recognized.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a conclusion: instead of prohibiting spitting, it is better to promote fitness; it is both respectable and practical. Western families do not have spittoons and do not have the bad habit of spitting anywhere. This is definitely not due to "prohibition." The Chinese have had a lot of phlegm for a long time. Since we recognize ourselves as weak patients, we should study the source of phlegm and the method of removing it, thinking about everything from the root. To put out a fire by pouring water on it or to whitewash the facade has the same effect as a fake cough. Those who prohibit will prohibit, and those who spit will spit; prohibiting and then spitting, spitting and then prohibiting, it is better to strive for the method of eradication, be active in strengthening the race and fitness, and improve life, so that they will not prohibit or spit, and the people can live!</p>
<h3>A String of Pearls</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>Shanghai is about to launch a campaign to discourage spitting.</p>
<p>Everyone's throat, is it related to illness or catching a cold? A hereditary habit like tuberculosis, coughing and spitting heard everywhere, resonating in harmony.</p>
<p>Atomic bombs are shocking when released, but microorganisms that cause death are wronged! I wonder how to talk about discouraging it? I'm afraid of being deified, raising those grunting Henga generals!</p>
<p>Note: Someone jokingly compares spitting phlegm to releasing atomic bombs, because tuberculosis is commonly called the primary disease, and the word "dan" (bullet) sounds like "tan" (phlegm).</p>
<h3>Appealing for the Refugees</h3>
<p>— Si Mang</p>
<p>The weather station issued alarming news: a Siberian cold wave is about to descend upon Shanghai. This news is almost more important than any other news, especially for refugees, and it is more closely related to them, and they are directly affected by it.</p>
<p>There are 200,000 refugees in Shanghai threatened by the cold wave. This alarming figure accounts for almost one-twentieth of the entire population of Shanghai. Although this figure is not very accurate, judging from the facts, it will not be less than 200,000 people.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Winter Relief Committee recently held a meeting to discuss this issue and decided that the relief funds needed are 60 billion. Although the government has allocated 10 billion, the difference is still very large, only one-sixth of the total amount, and the remaining five-sixths need to be raised separately. In addition to charity matches and increased entertainment donations, we must solicit donations from everyone to make up this figure. Therefore, the fundraising campaign that is currently being launched hopes that everyone, regardless of men, women, old, or young, will do their best to contribute to save the refugees in hunger and cold.</p>
<h3>"Spring Flowers Blooming in Autumn"</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouwu</p>
<p>I read a newsletter from Zhenjiang in the Shen Bao of October 31, which roughly stated: "In the garden of Zhang Buqing's residence at No. 10 Hama Courtyard, Nanmen Street, flowers and plants are mixed. Yesterday, the peonies, pomegranates, and crabapples in the garden bloomed one after another. Among them, the peonies were the most peculiar. The petals were purplish-red, and the flower plate resembled a bowl. The empty branches had no leaves, and the flowers bloomed at the ends of the branches. The local people all thought that spring flowers blooming in autumn was a rare and wonderful phenomenon."</p>
<p>According to the seasons, it has already reached the late autumn season when "grass and trees turn yellow and fall, and hibernating insects all droop," but for more than half a month, it has been like the weather of early summer, with gentle breezes and sunshine intoxicating people; [Old Lao's note: The weather has suddenly turned cold since the 18th]. At noon, if you walk a little longer in the sun, you can simply wear summer suits. No wonder the local communication pages of various newspapers have continuously published many news items such as "Autumn is acting like spring, and peaches and plums are competing for beauty," which is the same as our newspaper's "Peonies Blooming." Due to the recent "spring flowers blooming in autumn," I am reminded of the abnormal season of "autumn acting like spring." I occasionally recall a pre-written answer in the "Monthly Ordinance" of the Book of Rites regarding autumn acting like spring and autumn acting like summer: "If late autumn acts like summer, the country will have great floods, winter storage will be destroyed, and the people will sneeze a lot. If late autumn acts like spring, then warm winds will come, the people's spirits will be lazy, and the army will rise but not settle." Of course, this year's autumn has acted like summer, and it has also acted like spring; and not long ago, the yellow floods caused by the autumn tides, and the plague brought by the autumn tiger, do they not all fulfill the prophecy of this abnormal season?</p>
<p>We are faced with man-made and natural disasters, and a world of war and chaos. We appreciate these news about spring flowers blooming in autumn even more. I don't quite believe that Lu Buwei's "Broken and Rotten Court Reports," which mixed the seasonal ordinances of the twelfth month with the stories of the Three Dynasties and the Qin Kingdom, actually contain such a verified philosophy. Could it be that if there are abnormal human affairs in the world, there must be abnormal celestial seasons, and if there are abnormal celestial seasons, there must be abnormal man-made disasters and natural disasters, with each serving as a sign of the other, and always serving as a strong contrast? This point must be left to the great philosophers of the world to answer for us!</p>
<p>Announcement: Mr. Shazhou, please provide your communication address and real name. Mr. Li Renzhong: The payment slip has been sent. Please check and reply.</p>
<h3>A Study of Imperial Positions</h3>
<p>— Wang Baili</p>
<p>Opening the history of China and examining the emperors of past dynasties, some reigned for more than sixty years (Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty reigned for sixty-one years, Qianlong for sixty years), while others only held the title for two days, which is truly pitifully short. Now, from the Qin Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty, I have examined those whose imperial position was within four months and obtained the following six people:</p>
<p>Emperor Min of the Later Tang Dynasty during the Five Dynasties, reigned for four months and was murdered by the deposed emperor.</p>
<p>Prince Ziying, son of the First Emperor, reigned for sixty-four days and was killed by Xiang Yu.</p>
<p>Emperor Ningzong of the Yuan Dynasty reigned for two months and died young.</p>
<p>Emperor Guangzong of the Ming Dynasty reigned for one month, fell ill after consorting with a female servant, and died after the doctor administered a red pill.</p>
<p>The King of Changyi in the Han Dynasty was established for only twenty-seven days. He was wantonly playful, and Huo Guang, not daring to shirk his responsibility to the country, obeyed the empress dowager's order and deposed him.</p>
<p>Gao Yanzong of the Northern Qi Dynasty, with the reign title of Dechang, ascended the imperial throne on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month. On the same day, he was besieged by Zhou soldiers. After a night of fighting, the troops were defeated and captured. From beginning to end, it was only two days and one night. Those who like to joke said that he obtained a two-day emperor.</p>
<h3>Advertisements Fifty Years Ago</h3>
<p>— Shu Chai Fei</p>
<p>The advertising techniques of fifty years ago were not like today, appearing in newspapers and magazines, large cities, and even the streets and alleys of towns in a provocative and exaggerated manner. Fifty years ago, we found such an interesting advertisement for the sale of toothpaste in an American newspaper:</p>
<p>"I sincerely request members of society to purchase 'Popular Toothpaste.' This toothpaste is not a bit superior to other brands of toothpaste in my store, nor is it a bit cheaper... but I think at least its quality is as good as other brands. I especially recommend 'Popular Toothpaste' because it is supervised by my nephew, and he is a very trustworthy young man. If the sales of 'Popular Toothpaste' can improve a little recently, then he will soon have hope of getting married."</p>
<h3>Transforming Corruption into Integrity</h3>
<p>— An Shou</p>
<p>The words and deeds of one or two influential people often create or shift the prevailing atmosphere of an era. This is really not uncommon in history. Obvious examples include the pure and simple discussions of the early Jin Dynasty and the reverence for Buddhism in the Northern and Southern Dynasties, which influenced an entire generation. In the beginning, it was simply because a few emperors, kings, and ministers liked it that way.</p>
<p>During the reign of Kangxi in the Qing Dynasty, there was such a story:</p>
<p>——When Tang Wenzheng Gong (Bin) was the governor of Wu, he encouraged himself to be honest and virtuous, and promoted moral transformation. Those among his subordinates who were corrupt and cruel were all advised and encouraged, and only those who did not change were punished by law. Guo Zongxian (Xiu) was the magistrate of Wujiang at the time and was known for his corruption. Gong summoned him to the province and taught him to be upright and healthy. Guo said, "The reason I am corrupt and cruel is to satisfy the desires of the former Governor. Now that you have vowed to be honest and upright, please grant me a month's grace. If my reputation remains the same as before, please punish me according to the law." He returned to his residence and washed it every day, saying, "The former magistrate Guo Xiu is dead, and now another Guo Xiu has come." His politics underwent a complete transformation. (Xiaoting Miscellaneous Records, Volume 4. Tang Wenzheng)</p>
<p>The protagonist of this story, Guo Xiu, was a very ruthless and capable official. If he had continued on his initial path, relying on his abilities, he would undoubtedly have become a great corrupt official. But what did he end up doing? According to historical records, Guo Xiu's later political achievements in Wujiang were the best in the southeast. Tang Bin recommended him to the court, and he was promoted to censor. He impeached Grand Secretary Yu Guozhu and others for forming factions and engaging in private activities, and for accepting bribes behind the scenes. In his later years, when he was the governor of Hunan, all the corrupt officials were impeached, and the administration became clean.</p>
<p>A famous corrupt official changed into a famous honest official and even eliminated many corrupt officials. The reason was due to Tang Bin's one thought. If Tang Bin were also a corrupt official, then Guo Xiu's corruption would have been even worse, and those who would have been eliminated when he became a high official would certainly not have been corrupt officials but honest ones.</p>
<p>The mechanism is subtle, but the influence is extremely large.</p>
<p>In this era of prevalent corruption, we hope that the rulers will all have the same integrity as Tang Bin, and at least not allow their subordinates to use the proceeds of "corruption" to satisfy their own "desires." Then, transforming corruption into integrity is not a distant hope.</p>
