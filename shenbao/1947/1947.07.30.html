<h3>魏使會晤政界要員採納各方時局意見　莫德惠等論東北重要性</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕美大使館公布：魏德邁廿九日除仍與其顧問作例行會商外，曾接見若干中國人士。晨間大部時間與政界人物會談，十時許民盟張東蓀，羅隆　，黃炎培，章伯鈞等四人首批往訪，談約一小時。辭出後，社會賢達府委莫德惠及靑年黨領袖曾琦，執委周謙冲等相繼往訪蒲立德亦於晨間訪晤魏使，有所高談。下午則先後接見前軍委會委員李振翻。及警察總署署長唐縱。魏氏廿九日午晚均與司徒雷登大使共餐，至晚六時於匆忙之工作中，抽暇偕其顧問冒暴風雨赴下關，乘小艇遊弋於揚子江小作休息，藉江風淸流，消除其周餘之勞頓。茲誌各方人士與魏使談話摘要如次；民盟領袖張東蓀等表示，希望美國援華之目標爲協助中國走向和平統一之途，而不盼美援華以助長內戰之延長。魏氏表示：「余亟願幫助中國人民，同時希望中國人民能幫助自己」。渠旋並談及此次來華使命，在搜集各種事實資料，以爲援華參考云。莫德惠與曾琦，係於今午十一時及十二時分別往訪魏德邁，於一小時之談話中，曾以嚴正之態度說明東北對於世界局勢之關係，並請美注視蘇對東北野心，積極援助我政府，而使世界和平不致成爲海市蜃樓。記者於廿九日傍晚往訪莫德惠氏，承談彼晤魏使係司徒雷登大使所約「曾對中國一般問題交換意見，談次特別强調對東北決不放棄。東北人士亦毫無分裂之情緒」。魏使對莫氏所提兩點，表示甚爲重視。曾琦與魏使談話中，除對國內進步情形加以分析外特別指出東北關係整個世界未來之命運。渠並以七月廿一日美「時代週刊」所載「和平需要什麼代價」一文，爲與魏氏談話之結論。該文要點稱：「假使莫斯科有四憶華人或印人及其質源爲俄國工作三十年，則共黨之標威，必將更漲於美國」　　　　　　　　則將不容許美有三十年之時間以準備應付此種浩刦。俄國加上歐洲，可能較美國更强，屆時即不能阻止「共黨囊括亞洲，美國之安全也不是任何代價所能購得」。</p>
<p>曾琦提供文獻兩件表示勿使歷史重演</p>
<p>另悉：曾氏蓀昌美大使宿舍前，爲加强　使對東北問題之印象，特出贈渠前以中國靑年黨中執會委長次格，於一九三二年七月十一日致英首相麥克唐納電及同年同月十二日致法總理赫里歐電兩抄稿，請魏氏注意此兩通歷史電文之現代價值。茲誌原電文如下，曾琦致英首相愛克唐納電：「余切望閣下與歐洲諸政治家，於注意歐洲和平之外，同時注意亞洲和平，須知中日問題之嚴重並不下於德法問題；若公等衹解決歐洲問題而置亞洲問題於緩圖，恐第二次大戰之火，終將始於東方而延及西方。此則余所極願喚起閣下歐洲政治家之注意者也」。致法總理赫里歐電，「切盼閣下與歐洲政治家於注意西方問題之外，勿忘東方問題之嚴重，尤其對東三省問題，須作公平迅速而有效之主張，勿使白里安氏及世界政治家所努力造成之國聯盟約，非戰公約，華盛頓九國公約均成廢紙，終致　成世界第二次大戰，由亞洲而牽及歐洲也」。</p>
<h3>我國政治形態已有顯著進步　曾琦晤魏使時列舉事實證明</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕中國靑年學主席曾琦曁該黨常委周謙冲，廿九日晨往晤魏德邁時，曾首致謝魏氏戰時幫助中國爭取勝利之功績，並稱魏氏爲中國患難之友，繼述該黨參加國大及改組政府之經過，謂中國政治形態已有顯著之進步，如：（一）由一黨政府變爲三黨政府。（二）國府組織法之修改。（三）以共同施政綱領代替抗戰建國綱領。（四）取消一黨政制之儀式，（如讀孫逸仙博士遺囑等）。（五）國民黨黨費不再由國庫開支。（六）定期舉行會同普選，開始行憲，參加制憲之政黨現正共同協商進行選舉，即將展開空前熱烈之競選。中國政治形態已在重大變化中，行憲以後之中國政治，其變化之最大者：（一）由自上而下之政治，改爲自下而上之政治。（二）由東方考試制度改爲西方選舉制度。（三）由無常設民意機關監督之政府，改爲有常設民意機關監督之政府（四）由一黨制改爲多黨制。魏氏曾懷疑中國文盲太多，普選能否實行？曾氏謂，初次試騐誠有困難，然其效果：（一）可確定「主權在民」之原則，使人民自認爲主人翁。（二）可實行「政治教育」使人民程度因選舉而增進。魏氏亦爲首肯，談約五十分鐘，盡歡而別。</p>
<h3>魏使經濟顧問訪陳立夫長談</h3>
<p>交換經濟問題意見</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿九日電〕魏德邁特使之經濟顧問華爾克及工和顧問屈克塞爾，今午由美大使館經濟參事鮑令傑，陪同訪問陳立夫部長於寓邸。陳氏爲經濟改革方案之主稿人，兩氏就吾國經濟問題以及經濟建設等事項與陳氏交換意見，暢談兩小時之久，旋在陳氏處午飯後始辭去。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕魏使經濟顧問華爾克晨間曾訪經長陳啓天及經部高級官員。</p>
<h3>新聞顧問闢謠</h3>
<p>特加注意民盟說無稽</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕魏德邁新聞顧問華生，廿九日向記者否認某通訊社所傳，美政府有電指示使團，對民盟特加注意並多蒐集有關材料之說。渠稱，該項傳說，純屬無稽。使團之任務早經杜魯門及馬歇爾詳盡指示，來京後並未接獲華府方面任何命令，而須對某一集團某部份人士另眼看待，蓋彼等之人任務爲普遍性之「調查事實」與人事殊無關係。華生並稱，與魏氏偕來之四顧問，廿九日曾分別出動與各有關機關首長要員會商蒐集資料。據悉，政治顧問史蒲魯斯曾於民盟張東蓀辭返後，單獨赴梅園新邨與彼等有所談論。</p>
<h3>平英藉女傳教士促中共放下武器</h3>
<p>函請魏使向共　廣播</p>
<p>〔合眾社北平廿九日電〕此間英國女傳教士威麗絲，頃已向此間中國政府電台預定一廣播時間，留待魏德邁將軍至北平時，向共軍區域發表廣播演說，促共黨「入下武器　終止所有之惡作劇」。據威麗絲稱：渠已經由美國領事館致函魏德邁將軍，請其利用此一機會，以解除中國人民所受之可怕之痛苦。威麗絲認爲；魏德邁當將表示接受。</p>
<h3>魯冀綏均準備迎魏德邁特使</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南廿九日電〕魏德邁可能日內來濟考察，魯各界已準備熱烈歡迎。</p>
<p>〔本報　綏廿九日電〕魏德邁有來綏說，此間官方已爲準備寓所。</p>
<p>〔本報北平廿九日電〕孫連仲廿九日下午一時許由保返平，財政　長偕來，據悉；此行係爲候魏德邁而來，携有冀省軍政資料</p>
<h3>吳奇偉即赴平</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕據軍聞社訊：吳奇偉日前奉召晋京，已發表任北平行　副主任職，日內即將前途履新。</p>
<h3>對日貿易是否開放　待國務會議决定　政院討論各委熱烈</h3>
<p>— 言</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿九日電〕開放對日貿易案，廿八日經全經會討論決定暫緩後，即送交政院，該案爲廿九日政務會議會中最重要之議題，討論達二小時許，出席委員每人均發言數次，各就外交，經濟，財政，工商等問題廣泛發表意見，有認爲開放對日貿易與我有利者，其主要意見有二：一爲根據蔣主席於勝利後對日廣播時所稱，對日態度決採寬大爲懷政策，一爲各國均已採取開放政策，我不應放棄此項權利。其他有認爲應暫緩開放者，其意見則在就我國當前經濟面臨危機及工商業凋蔽情勢着想，認爲應行暫緩開放，未經張羣作結論，決將兩方意見彙集整理後，交國務會議作最後決定。</p>
<p>〔一報南京廿九日電〕政務會議廿九日例會中，於討論提案前，曾由白崇禧，王世杰，薛篤弼，霍寶樹四氏分別報告最近軍事，外交，水利，救濟情形極詳。</p>

<h3>我國困難局勢美漸普遍認識</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿九日廣播：紐約「世界電訊」撰社論稱：蔣主席籲請美國報界對於中國問題作更同情的考慮，此點值得吾人之深思。中國社會制度與各國不同，茍不　其本質而衡以西方標準，則對此廣大而複雜之國家，極易引起歪曲之印象。當一九三七年日本發動戰爭時，所謂中國共和國徒有其名，軍閥與共產黨分區割據，自一九三七年至一九四一年中國獨力抵抗侵略者，蔣主席領導國軍，　轉作戰，最後退守重慶，其時蔣主席處境艱困，不能着手革新國內情况。然而美國報紙於一九四四年即要求改變中國政體，謂蔣主席對共作戰，美國亦有利害關係，不久以前，美國務院曾堅持蔣主席應邀請共產黨參加其政府，今則美國人對於中國之困難局勢，已漸普遍認職矣。</p>

<h3>討論對日貿易聲中　訪問滬市工商界　一般主張加强進口管制</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕值此開放日本私人貿易問題在首都熱烈討論聲中，記者特訪本市工商界人士，請對此事作一冷靜之看法。一般之意見，認爲我中國工業界之危機不安，實有理由，因目前進口雖有管制，但已傳聞中信局易進之日貨中，竟有呢絨三萬碼，而呢絨則爲禁止進口之商品。故知進口管制之能否保護我國工業，實堪懷疑。但目前美國恢復日本貿易之心甚切，如其他國家均與日本恢復貿易，而我國獨持異識，事實上亦不可能，故補救之道，僅有兩端：一爲加强進口之管制，凡威脅我國民族工業之商品，絕對不准進口，反之，有助於我國生產者，自不在此例。如台灣工廠之需要日本機器零件者，即可由此獲得補充。此外，我國應增加關稅稅率，提高進口日貨之成本，使其無力與國貨競爭，亦不失爲有效辦法。某一商界領袖指出，抵制日貨之傾銷，亦僅有進口管理制度，目前對英·美貨物，行之有效，將來用之於日貨，當亦可收效。所當注意者，美國資本已參加日本之工業，而我國又亟盼美國之經濟援助，故限制日貨之進口，性質亦殊不單純。至於恐懼日貨之走私，則可不必，因航綫關係，過去日貨之大量走私地區爲東北及華北，目前均在中共控制之下，美國即欲推銷日貨，亦屬有心無力。香港之走私，因航綫及英國之關係，不足爲慮。</p>
<h3>中韓境天僑　無即撤退意</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿九日廣播：美陸軍部官員廿九日宣稱：「關於美僑在緊急時期自中韓兩國撤退事，美政府已完成常例式的計劃，但無即將採取行動之意」。美參謀總部深信！中國軍隊確能維持治安，保護美僑生命財產。</p>

<h3>社論　改革幣制與穩定幣值</h3>
<p>改革幣制問題，近來各方面甚爲屬目，其重點尤在於時期問題，卽現在立刻就着手改革？抑或等到適當時候再行改革！換句話說：對於應行改革的大前提，大家認爲並無問題，所成爲問題的，就是甚麼時候最爲適當而已。</p>
<p>原來我國的通貨膨脹，演變到現在的狀况，以視第一次世界大戰後德國的馬克和第二次世界大戰後匈牙利的班戈，在程度上，雖還覺得遠善於彼，但今日批發指數，已此戰前高起四萬餘倍，而且還有繼長增高的趨勢：以至儲蓄激減，投機旺盛，生產萎縮，商業停頓，而使公私經濟，均陷於非常困難的窘境，倘或熟視無覩，讓牠長此遝延下去，就無異束手無策，坐待經濟總崩潰的來臨，那總不是一般人所願見的。</p>
<p>至於改革的時期問題，雖值得仔細推敲，但我們認爲所以要實施改革的目標，尤不可不緊緊地把握住，作爲決定何時改革的標準。這目標是什麽？卽穩定幣值是。須知現在大家所以主張要改革，並非對於現行的法幣本身，有何種深惡痛疾的心理。不過覺得牠所具的價值，太流動，太低落，牠的作用，已經喪失得太多罷了。</p>
<p>如果法幣的價值，能立卽設法穩定起來，回復牠貨幣原來的作用，那麽，整理也好，改革也好，另發新幣固好，就是沿用現在的法幣，也未嘗不可商量。換句話脫，倘使整理或改革以後，其幣值依舊不穩定，從而物價，生活，財政，經濟等等也位舊不能穩定，那麽，未來的新幣，仍將無異於現在的法幣，而經過一番變更，徒使民衆增加一番紛擾和損失。果爾，則非徒無益，而又害之。</p>
<p>所以當前最迫切的問題，我們認爲還不在未來貨幣的本身，究是管理通貨？抑或採用硬幣？金本位制？抑是銀本位制？真正的問題，也並不必專在時間上考慮，而應慎重考慮到，用甚麽方法，具何種條件，方可使幣值穩定。我們要知道：整理或改革幣制，雖是穩定幣值的重要手段，但是整理和改革，並不是一定就可以穩定幣值。倘或辦得不得法，或條件不具備，很可能地會發生相反的作用。</p>
<p>那末，何種條件，爲穩定幣值所必要的呢？大家知道：凡通貨皆具有對內和對外兩種價值。遇到外匯基金缺少，使國際間收支失去平衡時，其對外價值—外匯—便要動搖了，甚至於要停頓了。因爲財政上的理由，通貨發行額太大，而實際上無此需要時，則其對內價值—物價—也要動搖了，要影響到物價，利率，工查，儲蓄，和全般的公私生活了。所以要穩定其對外價值，必須先充實其外匯，消滅其失衡狀態；要穩定其對內價值，必須先鞏固財政，停止通貨的繼績膨賬。這些都是穩定幣值的基本條件，無可假借，也無可取巧的。</p>
<p>上項前提，如果不錯，，那就可以研究到時期問題了。就是外匯基金，如何可以充實起來？要解決這個問題，不外乎治本與治標兩條途徑·如增進生產，發展出口，吸收僑匯等，都是治本的辦法：却皆須積日累功，逐漸增加，斷不是短時期內所可一蹴而幾的。也就是說：這個時期，何時可以到來在我國現在的情况下，無人可以準確地預料得到的。</p>
<p>其次是治標辦法，卽是向外借款。這筆外債，如果充分地能够應用，而且有人願意承借，那麽，外債成立之時，卽是怯幣的對外價值可以設法穩定之時。有人估計：現在發行的怯幣總額，折算戰前價值，不過美金三億餘元。所以五億元美金的借款如果可以磋商成功，而且對方願意儘先撥充外匯基金，不拘拘於生產器材，運輸器材，和其他建設用途時，則所謂整理或改革幣制，在那時當不難着手。但事實上是否可能？和何時方可實現？亦無人可以準確地澦料得到。</p>
<p>至於彌補赤字財政，在政府已擬有種種辦法，如整理稅收，剔除中飽，變賣敵僞餘剩資產，出售國營事業，價賣日本賠償物資，和節臧不必要之事業，裁汰駢枝機關等。假如大刀闊斧，切實做去，於國家財政上，自不無小補。但何時可以全盤做到？所得款項，是否足補總動員時，復員時，和種種建設時的需要？却也還未見有具體的說明。那麽，通貨膨脹的停止，和法幣對內價值的穩定，其時間上，也恐還是問題。</p>
<p>所以整理或改革幣制的時期，在今日討論，爲時似尙太早。、政府屢次聲明，改革幣制，要等到適當的時期，大約就爲通問題太複雜，所有各種條件，一時不易具備之故。我們要求幣值穩定，乃至經濟穩定，惟有運平內亂，平衡收支，一方面加緊生產，充實國力，這大概是現在盡其在我的不二法門了。</p>
<h3>外蒙與聯合國</h3>
<p>聯合國安全理事會會員資　審查會，前天在功湖畔舉行，討論外蒙古申請加入聯合國一項問題；我國代表徐淑希博士，當塲表示，中國堅反對以武力侵略我新疆省之鄰邦，申請加入聯合國，並將在安全理事中行使否決權。這一個嚴正的表示，當爲我國朝野所一致擁護。</p>
<p>聯合國機構在大戰的苦難時期誕生，曾替人類產生出一個美麗的遠景，並表示人類的一種覺悟，就是大家相信，人類唯有在國際合作中，如能保持世界的和平，人類唯有在和平中，才能謀得進步。聯合國機構就是促進國際合作，諒解，和平，進步以及繁榮的國際組織。但自成立迄今，已逾兩年，聯合國機構的成就，人們大都感到渺茫。在這兩年之間，國際間曾發生許多糾紛，提交聯合國處理，從未有一次能獲得有效的解決。所以聯合國機構，能否避不重蹈舊國際聯盟的覆轍，至今還是一個待考的問題。</p>
<p>外蒙古如果因爲懷着崇高的理想，盼望國際合作，促成世界和平的實現，而要求加入聯合國，當爲任何一國所歡迎，尤其是中國；但是外蒙古，不僅沒有竭誠愛好和平的表示，反而以武力侵入我國新疆省內，擾亂知平，這種國家的加入聯合國，不特不能增加聯合國的地位，抑且足以諷刺聯合國的存在。所以中國反對外蒙古加入聯合國，並非完全出於自私的動機，而是爲了聯合國的前途。</p>
<p>我們如若希望聯合國機構能成為維持世界和平真正有效的國際機構，則對於申請加入聯合國的國家，必須嚴格加以限制，決不可容許侵略國家混跡其間。蘇聯代表雖替外蒙古聲辯，但是白塔山事件是無法否認的，蘇聯代表終不能一手掩盡天下的耳目吧！</p>

<h3>荷政府準備接受英調停印荷事端　要求承認荷在印尼主權</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿九日廣播：據荷蘭非官方面稱，荷蘭政府準備接受英國調停印荷爭端，惟提出兩項條件：（一）印尼方面承認荷蘭在印尼之主權；（二）印尼立即發表停戰令。同时荷蘭勞工黨人士暗示，荷蘭之初步目標業已達到，恢復談判之時期，似已到臨。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿九日廣播：印尼電台廣播稱：印尼飛機一架，載醫藥品至被圍之印尼首都日惹，正擬降落之際，被荷軍擊落，機內七人包括英籍飛機師二人及婦女一人，均受重傷。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕舊金山廿九日廣播：印尼電台宣佈，印尼空軍今日首次出動，轟炸爪哇方面荷軍所佔領之城市二處。印尼軍隊在爪哇孟托普之東，擊落荷戰鬥機二架。荷蘭潛艇一艘砲擊位於爪哇海岸之拉布漢城。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖廿八日電〕截止今晨爲止，印尼代表團尚未接獲訓令，將印尼問題訴諸聯合國安全理事會。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿八日電〕此問主管方面頃談稱：英國將設勸阻聯合國安全理事會干涉印尼衝突。遠東問題專家曾舉行會議，起草貝文外相所當授與英國出席安全理事會代表賈德幹將士之訓令。聞賈德幹爵士將設法使安全理事會各代表發生一種印象，即印尼問題爲荷蘭之內政問題。英國所以採取此種態度，殆由於希望荷蘭與印尼接受英美之調停建議所致。此外，關於印度決定向聯合國機構提出印尼問題一事，英國官方人士聞訊之餘，頗爲詫異，尤其因爲英國黨希望印尼與荷蘭終將接受英美之調停，故更爲詫異。</p>
<p>〔聯合社日惹廿九日電〕印尼軍午夜發表特別公報稱，印尼空軍今晨轟炸日惹北約六十空哩荷軍攻勢出發點三寶　及其中途之　拉蒂卡。（接日前權威人士估計印尼空軍實力約有飛機四十架，旋據荷方宣佈，其中十架已被擊毀。）</p>
<p>〔路透社日惹廿八日電〕印尼公報稱：萬隆正巷戰中，共和軍已收復萬隆東南十二哩之吉巴拉日。共和國聲會爪哇西部有荷兵七百六十三名携機投降印尼。荷蘭公報宣佈己佔領答門答臘南部班狄阿森煤礦及拉加之鐵路工作，該煤礦爲荷　東印度最大之礦，而該工廠則爲共和國製造步槍輕機關槍等。荷軍司令部估計爪哇西部英荷墾殖公司因印尼之焦土正常而受之損失，達二百萬鎊。</p>
<p>〔台衆社巴達維亞廿九日電〕蘇門答臘離亞港一百哩之班圖普，有美孚汽油公司之油池四處，着火焚燒。印尼公報稱着火之責任，决不在印尼，而在荷蘭。</p>
<h3>印荷蘭係轉微妙　荷方表示歡迎沙利赴荷</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿九日電〕荷蘭通訊社稱：荷蘭在爪哇之軍事行動，可望於一星期內結束，並稱：荷蘭駐印大使蘭平，已於星期五自海牙啟程赴新德里，或將與現在該處之印尼前總理沙利（見圖）接觸。另據荷海外殖民部發言人稱，沙利若願來荷，荷蘭當表示歡迎。</p>
<p>〔路透社海牙廿九日電〕荷官方發言人否認外傳爪哇及蘇門答臘將被分成七部之說，據云荷政府在結束其在印尼之警察行動以前，當不致擬具任何計劃。荷發言人否認荷政府有變更林第蒂協定之意。渠表示相信警察行動不久可望結束，結束以後，當設法恢復對印尼之接觸。同時，若干社會黨員己要求社會黨執委會召開特別大會，將印尼前總理沙利蒞會發表印尼之意見。</p>
<p>沙和談話</p>
<p>〔中央社新德星甘八日電〕沙利今晨在尼赫魯官邸中接見中央社記者，渠稱：荷印目前之衝突，已非一內政問題，此實爲一獨立政府間之衝突。中，英，印，澳，美及其他各國，甚至荷蘭，在事實上已承認印尼共和國。荷蘭刻撤回其承認印尼共和國之諾言，但其他各已承認印尼共和國之國家，必不亦如荷蘭之反覆無常也。沙利復稱：印尼有華僑百萬餘人，而爲印尼之中間階級，若印尼發生牽延時日之戰爭，則華僑將遭最大損失。記者旋詢以「中國於向兩面　旋而遭拒絕後，應採何種步驟，以使印尼獲致和平？」沙利未經思索，立即答稱：「聯合國安理會應立即過問此事。」渠並認爲直接與印尼有關之中，印，澳，英，美各國，若採取直接干涉行動，則當較安理會之過問此事，更誒迅速有效。上述各國若能採取一致行動，其結果當更佳。沙氏稱：若環境許可，余甚願赴南宗一行。</p>
<h3>美報同情印尼抗戰</h3>
<p>英報獨支持荷蘭立塲</p>
<p>〔合眾社紐約廿九日電〕紐約先　　　報稱，美人不能接受荷蘭所列寧之在印尼挑起戰火之理由，　美國人民對亞洲人民自決之理想，深表同情也。然同情心無補於事實，荷蘭不久必將再度堅强控制印尼。此後之發展，當爲荷蘭之試金石。如荷蘭　能在達到其所稱之目的後，放下機關槍，　守林牙蒂協定，則必能博得世人之稱頌。然往往歐洲人在對付殖民地時，均自稱有純正崇高之目的。至其行動，又往往相反矣。紐約時報評印度之首先向聯合國爲荷印戰爭而呼　稱，此實爲美國及其他西方民主國之恥。此舉將便白種人在亞渊失去其威信，且加深歐亞之鴻溝。尼赫魯及其他亞洲領袖對印尼戰事怨憤之反應，實表示亞洲之合作。武力控制之時期已告過去，或至少即將結束矣。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿八日電〕英國約克羣郵報本日發表社論，對於荷蘭在印尼所採取之政策，表示同情。其文略謂：自本年三月廿四日以來，荷蘭無往而不採取妥協態度，但印尼拒不實施雙方所成立之妥協方案，以致爭議再起，日惹極端派竟壓迫前內閣總理沙利辭職，新政府並否認其在巴達維亞對於荷蘭所作之諾言云。</p>
<h3>緬北部發生暴動　大批軍警馳往各區鎭壓</h3>
<p>〔路通社仰光廿八日電〕緬甸北部泰拉華第及漢沙達等區發生暴動，軍營已馳往鎭壓。該處原爲反對反法西斯人民自由聯盟者之根據地，此次暴動，或係被捕前總理鄔沙所領導之國民黨所煽動　察最近會在該處捕獲多人，抄出武器不少。同時緬甸新內閣今日在仰光開會時，署外設置十呎高之障碍物，必由衛隊嚴密戒備。緬首任駐美大使　下月將赴美履新</p>

<h3>英外交部發出邀請書　召開四外次會議　蘇聯首先答覆接受邀請</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿九日廣播：英外部發言人正式發表：蘇聯已接受英國之邀請，出席四國外次會議。該項邀請書同時發往華盛頓·莫斯科及巴黎，蘇聯已首先答覆，法國原則上已經贊同，美國尚未答復。據悉：此次外文會議將照上次外長會議决定，准許德奧代表列席。</p>
<h3>英經濟危機日益嚴重　艾德禮處境困難　上下兩院即將舉行辯論</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿八日電〕此間有資格之觀察家談稱：艾德禮首相自失去國會內工會議員之擁護後，國家經濟局勢所形成之危機今已在英國政治方面發生作用，所可注意之事實有二，即　上週五工會總務會議未經討論政府之經濟政策即拒不表示贊同，　國會工黨議員定於週三開會，幷已邀請艾德禮首相出席。目前艾相所面臨之雙重反對派，乃工黨「叛徒」與工會議員。聞艾相現擬籍樞密大臣莫里遜與財相達爾頓之幹旋，以使公會議員轉入政府懷抱。倘此一努力失敗，則工黨「叛徒」與工會議員殆有實行合併結成反對派集團之可能。</p>
<p>同時美元危機日甚一日，政府爲緩和當前之經濟局勢，所將施行之可能辦法，有如下述三端：　减低糧食輸入；　减低原料輸入；　節省佔領區內之經濟。但亲人咸認爲第一項措施決不爲國人所擁護。觀察家繼稱：目前惟有以「鄧扣克精神」由國民聯合政府或由衆　所歸之領袖，出而領導工黨內閣，始可付諸實行，此則要以貝文外相爲最孚衆望。工黨人士亦認爲渠爲最適當之人物。但倘欲經由不信投票而即行更迭首相，則英國國會與工黨皆無此習例云。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦廿八日電〕艾德禮首相今晚召集若干閣員，大半爲經濟專家舉行會議。據消息靈通人士談會：此次會議之目的，乃在起草首相定於卅日向工黨大會所發表之演說，故　　大臣格林伍特，財相達爾頓，樞密大臣莫里遜暨商相克里浦斯，均曾出席此次會議，曾討論下列四項問題：　缺少美元問題；　增加煤斤生產問題；　對外貿易問題；　缺少人力問題。</p>
<p>〔英國新聞社倫敦廿九日電〕上下兩院在國會夏季休會以前，將辯論經濟情勢方面最重要問題及英國之前途。上院辯論將由自由黨發動，下院辯論則由保守黨獲得自由黨同意而主持。此等辯論可於八月四日開始。各黨議員頗感焦急，謂國會休會以前，政府經濟方面種種困難應有明確之說明，以及對執行辦法須闡明政府本身之見解。</p>
<h3>杜魯門總統　昨日飛返華府</h3>
<p>杜太夫人葬儀極爲簡單</p>
<p>〔合眾社格　特　廿八日電〕在烈日當空之七月廿八下午，在一簡單之儀式中，杜魯門總統太夫人遺體葬於　林小山基地。儀式僅費廿分鐘，並無歌頌功德之贊辭或哀樂。相儀　，白空即宣佈杜魯門總統將於廿九日飛返華盛頓。</p>
<h3>猶恐怖犯三名　昨執行槍決　聖地嚴事戒嚴</h3>
<p>〔路透社耶路撒冷廿九日電〕五月四日攻擊阿克爾監獄，於六月十六日經軍事法庭判決死刑之猶太人哈此勃·魏斯　及那卡拉等三名，已於今日梯曉在阿克爾監獄絞決，屍體已運巴勒斯坦北部之薩法特，與前於四月十六日絞決之猶太恐怖犯葛羅納等四名同葬一處。當局已於昨夜通知三犯家屬，囑其往薩法特等待屍體之運到，同時巴勒斯坦全境預料將加緊戒備，蓋猶太恐怖　伊爾根黨之總司令貝琴業已宣布，將於絞決三人之同時，絞死被其拘禁之英军曹二名，以資報復故也</p>

<h3>外蒙申請加入聯合國　我國聲明撤回支持　侵我領土顯非愛好和平國家</h3>
<p>〔合眾社成功湖廿八日電〕蘇聯代表克拉西里尼柯夫今日在安理會資格審查委會中，支持外蒙之入會申請時，認爲中國所稱外　軍隊侵入中國　培事，乃「捏造之言」，其目的或爲轉移中國內情況方面之注意的。克氏並謂此　乃根據外蔡答覆中國聲明之官方公報。克氏繼稱，外　空軍隊僅表於中國陸軍一團處入國境而不願退出時　之出境而已。中國代表徐淑希稱，外蘇軍隊曾於兩月之前企圖佔領新疆省之北塔山，而從事「武力侵略」，殊非愛好和平國家之行爲，故中國不能贊同外蔡之入會申請。該委會英美兩國代表現對外蔡之主權問題，表示懷疑。美代表雷諾稱，外蒙現僅獲得中蘇兩國之承認，而與其發生外交關係者亦僅有蘇聯一國。　氏並謂，渠在有所決定前，頗願聽　中國代表答覆克氏之言論。該委會在中國代表三十日答覆此事之前，現已暫緩以最後決定。</p>
<p>我代表演辭全文</p>
<p>〔中央社成功湖廿八日電〕中國代表徐淑希今晨在安理會入會資格審查委會中發表演說，茲錄其全文如下；「本委會中去歲在任委員之諸位先生當能憶及本委會去歲討論外蒙人民共和國申請加入聯合國事宜時，中國代表團曾建議持以謹慎，惟其後於安理會中討論該事項時，則投票贊成其入會。該申請國截止去夏止，建國已有一年之久，唯僅與一國維持活躍關係，且僅允諾與一國交換使節，結果全球均不悉其是否爲愛好和平，能否願實行聯合國憲章內所規定之種種義務，即千百年來其所隸屬且曾慶賀其獨立之國家，亦莫知其詳。中國刻仍主張聯合國之會籍應予普遍，抑且曾准許申請顯獨立。同時就一般而言，對爭取自由及獨立之各民族，表示同情。由於上述種種较爲廣大之理由，中國於最後檢討階段中改變初衷，取消反對之窟，然申請國如此神秘，各國代表團中有未能準備與中國共同冒險，結果安理會並未建議准許外蒙爲聯合國之一員。</p>
<p>光陰茌苒，　忽一年，中國在此一年內與甚多其他國家，一致期望本國代表團所持懷疑並非事實，並能今聯合國安然表決，允許申請國加入聯合國。然中國期望之結果如何，即申請國武裝部隊侵入新疆省，企圖　取北塔山一帶地方是也。此侵略事件係於、最近數月中發生者，至今猶未終止，其藉口劃爲北塔山爲申請國之領土而非中國之領土，然根據事實而言，該地區在雙方界綫記錄上所載之新疆省内，該記錄至爲明白可靠。該界綫係於三十餘年前名爲外蒙古之自治區成立時所劃定者。截止外蒙入侵之日爲止，迄無人非議，即外蒙獨立爲外蒙古人民共和國時，亦係如此。該地區於過去多年內，迄由中國治理，並由雖不足以擊退　有一切現代武器之全力侵略行動，略如吾人所見及現仍見及者，其中並有飛機作戰，但能維持治安之中國軍隊負責防守。就理論而言，縱申請國對北塔山地區有所有權，然亦不應採取宛如戰爭之方法以遂其目的。</p>
<p>該申請國從未試與中國談判，亦爲採取調停和解　建議調查，或付諸仲裁及法律解决方法，其首先採取之行動，即爲侵略，並以限期四十八小時答覆之哀的美敦盡送致當地當局。中國政府提出抗議，並要求停止軍事行動，退出被侵略之地方以待調查時，申請國竟答謂該地方屬於該國。主席先生，蒙古人民共和國已採取與其申請加入聯合國時允諾接受之聯合國憲章內所規定義務相悖之行動，該團一旦加入聯合國後，將不能或不願履行此等義務。該國未能表現爲愛好和平國家，中國代表團前僅懷疑外蒙人民共和國加入聯合國之資格，而今日則認爲其無資格加入聯合國，是以中國無從予以其於年間在此所予之支持。</p>
<h3>英蘇貿易談判破裂經過　英商相提出報告　財政問題未獲解决爲失敗主因</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿八日電〕商務大臣克里浦斯爵士在下院報告稱：英蘇貿易談判之破裂，係因不能就蘇聯清償一九四一年向英借款之條件成立協議之故。關於因小麥價格過高而產生之困難，至談判末期已告解決。在關於消償借款之財政問題陷入僵局前，有關貿易部份之一切問題，包括數量價格及運輸等均已成立協議。訂購木材之合同已經簽字，訂購　量之合同亦已準備簽字。蘇聯向英訂購各種機械配備之數量已經議定，而蘇聯採辦團來英簽訂契約之程序亦經討論。蘇聯事實上確願於今後四年內以大宗　物供給英國，在一九四七年先以新收　糟一百萬噸供給英國。</p>
<p>在貿易方面既已均告成立協議，不幸在財政問題方面竟陷入僵局。英國已允减低一九四七年借款之利息千分之五，放棄購貨須付現金百分之四十之要求，並已從事讓步，以接近蘇聯之延長償還一切　款之要求。伹英國不能接受蘇聯之全部要求，以爲訂立貿易協定之條件。事實上除關於利率及支付現金兩點，已全部接受蘇聯之要求外，關於延長清償期之點，英國亦已接受蘇聯要求之百分之六士。英國準備之　步，已將使其在今後至四年內蒙受重大損失。英國由於其本身之財政困難、實已無法接受蘇聯自稱爲最低限度之要求。然英政府仍希望此僅之失望，深盼英蘇貿易以大事擴展，而英國外貿易大臣在莫斯科談判時，蘇聯政府亦已給于此項保證云</p>
<h3>希政府內鬨</h3>
<p>公安部長拍案退出</p>
<p>〔合眾社雅典廿八日電〕希臘公安部長齊　伐斯，廿八日在內閣討論蛰　是否有　批評政府對进　隊之作戰方式後，一怒而退出內閣會議。齊氏之行動，事實上與辭職無異，渠拍案而起讀，依目前情形而諭，渠在政府内己無立足餘地。按齊氏對於　擊隊自阿爾巴尼亞侵入希境事，曾與參謀部發生意見上之衝突，渠最近並公開批評政府軍之戰術，因此更形　不相容。</p>
<h3>挪船滿載硝化物爆炸　法勃港發生大火　死二十人重輕傷達千餘</h3>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿八日電〕載運硝化物之挪威輪「海洋自由」號，今日下午二時在法國勃萊斯特港起火爆炸，死者二十人，傷者二百五十人，勃萊斯特商業區正焚燒中，「海洋自由」號係自紐約駛來，載有硝酸氬二千五百噸。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿八日電〕勃萊斯特港於發生挪威船一艘之爆炸後，今夜在烈熖焚燒中，已查明死者廿人，傷者達一千一百名，内重傷一百名，眾認此乃法國承平時期最大之慘劇。至今日深夜，勃萊斯特商業區之火勢，已在控制之中，即將熄滅，惟許多居民，深恐再有爆炸，紛紛进出城外，損失估计達一億法郎。據挪船船上人員言，該船於十二時卅分時，船上第三貨艙冒出濃烟，工人及船員協力救火，惟以烟霧過濃，一時不易救熄，旋即聞第一次爆炸，碼頭市商會之倉庫被引着火。當彼等離船時，見法砲艇一艘正南該船發砲，海水雖自彈穴湧入，然火勢仍未稍煞，業已波及全船。至下午五時半許，又發生第二次爆炸，其聲較第一次更大，港口附近房屋之門窗及傢具，被震毁者不少。火勢旋即延至商業區，附近一汽油站亦被焚及。據悉，該挪船船長已告殞命，碼頭之汽油庫及煤氣廠，至午夜猶焚燒未已，受傷之人，大多係遵玻璃碎片等劇傷。</p>

<h3>參議會昨舉行茶會　討論憲警衝突事件　同時報告新民晚報復刊經過</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會潘議長徐副議長昨日下午舉行茶會，招待全體參議員及市府長官，參議員到會者百餘人，吳市長宣司令及各局處長亦聯袂出席。潘議長首先報吿稱：下次大會原擬九月九日開幕，惟其時適逢中樞召集四中全會，故或需延至九月下旬舉行。</p>
<p>本市新民晚報等前由淞滬警備司令部依據戒嚴法飭令停刊，當時本會第三次大會會決議擁護，並請政府禁止對該報紙之復刊在案。本年七月七日接獲宣司令來函，略謂新民報總公司，自認上海新民晚報以前所載言論確有失檢之處，決將編輯，採訪兩部從業員調整，聲請復刊，函微意見，以備參考。當經於七月十五日去復，請警備部衡情酌辦。嗣新民報總公司又星文行政院新聞局，轉呈行政院批准復刊，經行政院令國防部，由國防部令警備部准予復刊，故廿六日宣司令又來函，稅明已准該報復刊。查新民晚報旣自認以前言論新聞處理欠妥，願今後負責整頓，務期配合國策，推行政令，故新民晚報之復刊，尚與本曾以前決議之精神不相牴觸。特乘今天茶會機會，向諸位議員作一報吿。潘議長詞畢，則請吳市長致詞，吳市長提到日昨金都戲院憲警衝突事件謂：耳前首要，務使複雜之事態簡單化，至於責任問題，中央已派大員來滬，會同三方面調查，確定是非，再依軍法辦理。警察罷勤，經勸諭訓導後，逐漸好轉，迄今日（廿九日）下午止已完全恢復正常，可以吿慰諸位；今復務將憲警職擭劃分淸楚，不使再有同樣事件發生。</p>
<p>宣司令報告</p>
<p>新民晚報前左五月間與文匯報聯合晚報同時停刊，現該報已悔過改善，經行致院批准復刊。至於憲警衝突事件，簽爲遺憾。此事起因極小，而衝突結果，已死警察七人，市民一人，傷警察六人，市發三人，鑒此亘禍實由一部分憲警智識不够，對本身職權不够了解，事後警察情緒激昂，昨日（廿八日）上午情形一度嚴重，下午即趨好轉，態當已不致擴大。責任問題已組織三人小組着手調查，憲兵，警察原均由警備司令部管轄，惟本人警察局長名義尚未交卸，故電請國防部派員調查真相，依法處斷、此案最大癥結在憲警職權未劃分淸楚，經此事件以後，其制度常可望改善也。</p>
<p>各參議員　紛提質詢</p>
<p>旋由參議員張適作代表參議會警政委員會，報吿調查憲警衝突經過。後各參議員即相繼起立發衣意見，對　警衝突事件，若干參議員態度殊爲激昂。瀋議長表示：（一）此一不幸事件，在負責調查機關未發表事實真相前，希望暫少發表意見，以免有所偏袒。（二）參議會爲代表本市民意之機關，希望能使市民安居樂業，此次不幸事件之發生，主要原因乃在憲警職權未曾劃淸，希望由此一事件而促使中央注意改善，（四）國民應遵重守法精神，按看戲應該購票，而此次觀衆三人僅持二票即欲入塲，巳屬破壞守法精神，卒至造成此一不幸事件之導火綫，聞觀衆之一且爲工務局之科長，如此說屬實，尤應請工務局查明嚴辦，再如最近新聞報前總主筆李浩然君之撞斃，肇事之駕駛人員開竟無合法執照，如此藐視人命，有關當局亦應竭力注意取締。此後參議員吳正矱，龐京周，朱宗德，童襄，張志韓等相繼發言，對金都戲院被非法搗毀，均表憤慨，希望負靑當局於查明真相，秉公辦理。參議員王先靑並提出三點意見：（一）對無辜化難市民，應從優撫恤，（二）金都戲院之損失，政府應負責賠償，（三）衝突事件，查明眞相後，切實懲兇。吳市長乃起立答復如下：（一）外傳憲警衝突起因於工務局第四區某科長無票觀戲一節，或謂三人購票一一紙，或謂完全購票，此事尚未查明真相，暫難明其責任，如查有實據，自當依法辦理。（二）金都戲院損失，應於此事查明真相後，由責任方面賠償。（三）撫恤之事，原則無問題，惟其詳細辦法，須討論後論決定等　，茶話會於七時半始散。</p>
<p>起立致詞者爲潘議長，右爲吳市長，左爲徐副議長及宣司令。（中國社攝）</p>

<h3>幼稚學校的重要</h3>
<p>— 丹尼爾士著</p>
<p>在這次大戰中，英國衛生部爲鼓勵已婚婦女出外做工起見，曾創設了一種白日托兒所，只要繳付一筆不多的費用，母親們就可以將孩子交與托兒所看顯，而安心去做工。在托兒所中的兒童，大多數都變成了強壯健康而具有獨立性的小傢伙。不過，當時的托兒所，主旨只在照顧兒童，而沒有給予幼稚教育。</p>
<p>這些白日托兒所，已由衛生部移交與地方教育委員會，現在它們必須決定是否要將這些托兒所關閉，或是繼續照原樣辦理，或改成幼稚學校。</p>
<p>幼稚學校教育，是爲國歲到五歲的兒童而設的。許多專家相信，這段教育時期，實在應該從兩歲到七歲，不應該五歲的時候有所中斷。</p>
<p>我曾經到一家辦理究善的幼稚學校參觀過。我獲得了非常愉快的經騐。我發現男孩子們特別喜歡做點心，女孩子們在不給洋娃娃洗澡的時候，却特別喜歡做太工。</p>
<p>一個四歲孩子，坐在餐桌的主人位上，儼然有指揮一切的意任感。</p>
<p>我以爲幼稚學校，對於所有的兒童都有利益，理由如下：第一，它不滅除母親與家庭對孩子的影響，反而使一個有和諧家庭生活的孩子產生一種安全的感覺，相信自己有與別人和樂共處的能力；第二，多數家庭不能供給兒童所需要的一切，如玩偶，家庭用具，積太，工具，繪料，粉筆，石灰，麵團，小種植園，沙與水，以及安全的露天遊戲塲等，而學校裏却應有盡有。此外幼雅學校的房屋，又都是空氣流通，陽光充足的。學校又竭力注重教育個人淸潔，各人有自己的手巾，肥皂，牙刷與梳子，遊戲大半在露天舉行。</p>
<p>同時，學校又有看護與醫生，時時注意各個兒童任何疾病的初期象徵，多數學校又旅行白喉與百日咳的預防針。</p>
<p>最要緊的，有了幼稚學校，母親們就能出去做工。總而言之，這假幼稚學校，是有百利而無一弊的。（英國大使館處</p>

<h3>羣聲過港第二戰　乘勝大敗港聯軍</h3>
<p>〔本報香港航訊〕菲島羣聲籃球隊，過港第二戰，於廿四日在中靑健身房舉行，羣聲乘輕取南華之餘威，又大勝港聯隊，比數是五四對三十。</p>
<p>這塲比賽，原定在加山南華塲對抗，但「天公」不予方便，迫得改在中靑塲比要，中靑塲地狹小，演來，羣聲無法得展所長，所以在第一節中，竟被港聯以八比六先勝。</p>
<p>港聯佔先</p>
<p>開賽的時候，羣聲用李世僑，蔡文華，蔡文章，陳金德，楊人輝出戰，港聯以詹涉江，盧振暄，張樹棠，陸德彰，石振達拒敵。接觸後，張樹棠兩度籃底偷進，港聯以四比零領前，自文章投入成四比二後，振暄，人輝，振達，文章，各進一隻，港聯以八比六，先勝第一節。</p>
<p>羣聲反勝</p>
<p>第二節：羣聲調金典替出世僑，人類比八平手，旋見盧振暄偷籃不進後，港聯即轉逆境，半塲時，羣聲已反敗爲勝，以十八比十二超前。</p>
<p>再接再厲</p>
<p>再瞧：港聯高家和替詹涉江，客軍亦有金德，人暉下野，世僑，連科上塲，第三節，客車花巧百出，自文華托入，世僑單刀立功後，積分驟增，港聯只奪回七分（張樹棠包辦六分）成三十一比二十完。</p>
<p>港聯慘敗</p>
<p>末一節，在最初四分鐘間，港聯尙能靠遠射支撑局面，往後即被羣聲予取予求，無法抵票，終塲是五十四對三十。</p>
<p>羣聲隊定於廿六日離港返華，因隊員大多需繼續肄業，難於長期請假，同時旅費又成問題，故征滬之舉，難成事實。</p>
<p>廿五日，尚有魏賽一塲，在加山再戰南華，但羣聲隊經聲明不在中靑塲比賽，要是下雨的話，則作罷論。</p>

<h3>審議會代表訪沈處長　商討工業限額分配</h3>
<p>工商業如不能協議恐有嚴重後果</p>
<p>〔本報特訊〕限額工業原料分配審議委員會，昨有代表潘士浩田和卿吳紀春等，往訪輸　會限額分配處沈奏庭處長。前經審議會召集各公會協議分配，呈報有案之品，如鋅及各種五金等，分配處因未包括五金之全部協議，初仍表示困難；，嗣經代表等力爭，始允重視協議所定之百分率辦理。關於其他工業原之分配，雙方交換意見，審讓會以商業公會未能順利合作，進口商方面又橫生支節，表示棘手。且向沈處長言明，審議會方在徵求協議，分配處同時在接受申請單，工作必難期其圓滿，請沈處長另定有效辦法，以科正偏枯。但沈處長以事關工商業切身利害，仍囑勉爲其難。代表等出後，即發出通知，定於明後二日，分別如開審議委員會及工業公會代表會，報告經過，並商討進行方針。據某代表語人，第一季限額，分配處云已十去其七，工業界願聞其分配之真相。分配處透露消息，前日顔料商業公會會有代表往見沈奏庭處長，希望根據歷年辦理進口成績，分配限額。沈處長未表示意見，僅吿其與工業界協商。且鄭重聲明，工商業如始終不能協議，恐有嚴重後果云。</p>
<h3>空方逢低有補　華股由疲轉堅</h3>
<p>華股昨投機力理仍限於永紗，美亞次之，過程因空方有補，疲後回好，永錄交易熱鬧，北幫及證券中各活動派，在匯率及幣制等種種幻想中，買意忽吿興奮，低後逐步邁進。廣帮二一八號一再力售，爲數甚互，高價後亦不乏回頭，拉鋸不己。小型股新光景福華豐等亦能隨水紗爲進退，漸形穩定。冷熱各股均以漲多跌少之局結束，前途雖有生氣，恐尚多盤旋。</p>
<p>最開時以報載對日貿易之重行開放，已吿展緩，內有助買因素，但隔前國行交換差進不少，而下月起銀錢業有停止當日票據抵用之訊，業中人心仍感壓迫。除遞水紗以投機氣氛較濃，而開低至二二八元，餘股則尚形平穩。遞永紗開後，三一號一五二號三五號九五號一五六號二二四號均售，而降至二二三元。九時二十分，二二三號一一七號一一二號一二七號二〇三號一七三號三二號一八〇號俱進，回升至二三四元。一五一一號一八五號二三一號二三四元仍賣，又低至二二三元。此時信和已破入三千元大關，而美亞會低至四二〇元。其餘各小型股，若新光景福華豐咸降至低價，爲狀十分怯疲。一〇四號二二三號趁低進至二三〇元。</p>
<p>十時半，因一二九號九五號之豆額供給，仍屈居於二二五元左右掙扎。迨夫美亞有補空模樣，大戶若一五七號一八六號一四號六一號等買胃奇健，遞美亞逐步回好，不久回漲達三十元以外，人心始稍振作。五四號四號一七三號一一二號一八〇號五四號買胃轉健，遞永紗回升至二三六元。十一時後，八九號二二三號趁高了結，退至二三〇元左右。二二四號補空股切，現遞均有吸納，一六〇號一一二號二四號二二四號以及北帮九四號猛購，遞永紗乃漲到二四四元。小型股新光華　亦開始回秀，景福彈力較少。廣帮一二八號及一五四號趁高猛售，退至二二三八元。一四二號二一九號二二四號二二三號一五七號猛購，二二四號並力納現永紗，助買流言較多，終於拉高到二四七元。廣帮二一八號一六二號一七二號三號聯袂猛售，一八六號亦賣。十二時後，曾回低至二三八元。二二三號二二四四號一五二號六九號等買意仍殷，極面帮亦來抬價，升至二四六元。廣帮二一八號及銀行帮八號仍加出　，現遞永紗遂均以二四一元之價結束。</p>
<p>收後喊價見穩，結果較前收計即永紗信和永公中怯各升半成左右，美亞華豐微升，新光新華平平。景福勤興微挫，商務中絲大通火柴內衣國貨均平，中紡水泥統益景綸微升，麗安微挫，五和跌半成。遞交股計華豐美亞信和微升，新光尚平，景福徽挫，永紗永公各漲半成弱，塲外各老股微升者居多。</p>
<h3>證交開常務會議　營業時間有更改</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕證券交易所常務理事會第廿二次例會，於昨日下午四時起，在證交會議室舉行。全體常務理事，除王志莘氏赴台缺席外，均行出席，由理事長杜　主席，討論至五時卅分散會。</p>
<p>昨日會議席上，除例常業務報吿外，並討論議案二起：（一）因天時炎熟，市塲營業時問，自本週四起，改爲自上午九時起，至中午十二時止。（二）推定獎學金保管委會委員九人，除常務理事七人爲當然委員外、再添楊蔭豫顧善昌二人爲委員。至獎學金辦法施行細則，推由楊蔭潯擬就後公布</p>
<h3>統債盤低　外股微升</h3>
<p>公債昨中途曾見怯疲，但以潮汕幫及三六〇室績納，五五一一室雖供，低後尚易拉上。統丙晨開八八〇〇元，低價八二〇〇元，最後仍在晨初價徘徊，成交約三百萬左右。結果較前收計甲乙丙戊均挫一百元，統丁跌二百元。</p>
<p>外股昨亦呈由低反動之象，怡紗晨開七七五〇〇元，高價八四八〇〇元，而後回低少許結束，證券帮洋行帮有納，慶帮及紗業有所脫手。結果較前收計紙業怡紗電話各升半成左右，怡紗會德藝航業祥泰微升，榮廣英聯兩者</p>
<h3>棉紗布仍疲</h3>
<p>棉紗布近日盤旋乏振，各檔明緊暗鬆，表面雖以客帮觀望，鄉銷滯呆，實則投機商技窮，囤戶改行，致無大量去化。據悉存儲本市棉紗布，現貨爲數可觀，足敷長期需要，茲分誌昨日市况如下：</p>
<p>棉布父易平淡，市勢依然盤局。緣以鄉帮農忙之際，購胃甚微，客帮亦多　穩，採辦甚稀。再加當局管制加強，人心不振，故我機者均有轉向活動之勢。行情起伏有限，龍頭細布比上日微見　升，其餘白坯布等俱少變化，土林布亦呈平定局面，紡建昨（廿九日）照例開售，五福細布掛牌爲三九萬元，金蓮妙舞　嘰售四九萬三千元。</p>
<p>棉紗需要鬧散，做開以小額成　僑多。市勢堅後即　，上落在十廿萬元之間。二十支　磅雙馬由三〇萬元喊開。嗣期一路盤低主一〇九〇萬元收市，比上日轉降廿萬元。四十二支水月小廿萬元，藍鳳降十萬元，餘亦俱跌五至廿萬元不等。</p>
<h3>日繭不百萬磅　擬抑價售於我國　約需價款一百八十萬美金</h3>
<p>頃據三區繅絲公會息：該會接得蠶絲協導會通知，盟宣總部最近來電：以日繭一百萬磅售於我國，每磅價美金一元八角，較諸去年每磅索價二元八角，已減降三分之一強。依此計算，共需一百八十萬美金，可繅生絲二千　百担，以生絲每磅四元計算，可售一百三十三萬美金，如以外匯收買美人絲，以每磅美元九角計算，可購人絲一百四十七萬餘磅，而目下國內絲織業人絲轍入限額，每季原定五十六萬五千元美金，不敷需要至鉅。如以此項生絲，掉換人絲，可達一百四十七萬餘磅，依國內人絲每箱（二百磅）二千萬元售價計算，可得法幣一千四百餘億元。以一百八十萬美匯，收回一千四百餘億元之通貨，尙屬全算。該會現正計算請求當局，擬以官商合辦，經營此項生絲之繅製。</p>
<h3>陳祁門一萬四千箱　由華洋茶商洽購　冰蛋輸出暫行停止辦理</h3>
<p>輸出推廣委員會執行委員會廿九日上午十時，由陳副主任委員經交換意見後，通過案件兩起。（一）對茶商抵押滿期之祁門箱茶部份，交中信局由華洋茶商購買。（二）對冰蛋收購事宜，繫於種種因素，暫吿段落。關於第一項，係茶商去年度陳茶，由四聯總處輔助抵押於中農銀行，已於本月份到期，其中祁門一萬四千箱，全部由英商怡和洋行購買一點，原則上雖可贊同，惟該會鑒於洋商整個承購，似欠妥善，價格每磅僅合一先令兩便士半，似嫌太低，該會爲採取折衷辦法，授權中信局，召集中外茶商，雙方洽購。關於第二項，以該會前會託中</p>
<h3>食米消化仍呆　行情略見挺升</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共計到貨米糧五千四百餘石，店方零化有動，南市粳秈米續見挺升三五千元，白元再加萬元，北市步升萬元，但銷胃依然不濃。間湖南已實行開業，則湘省本爲產米最豐富之區，勢必大量東下，際此新陳交接之時，米情變化正多，甚難逆料。</p>
<p>麵粉內地北銷轉勁，去胃香燥，申方隨之護挺，多砌三四千元。麩皮亦跟各物上漲，回升三四千元。豆餅汕頭不動，鄉莊納盟仍淡，形勢明定暗進。黃豆客幫略動，油廠進胃尙可，本街另化蟬聯，市况惝利，再漲萬元。　豆東北長江均有到貨，四川新　豆到申，趨勢看疲。赤豆因天熱製棒冰需用，去化尚可，轉漲萬元。蠶豆消化略動，本街捒高納取，浙方猪口去路逢低收吸，市形明疲踏堅。芝蔴疲中帶定，苞米軟化，生仁洋莊續辦，飛騰一二萬元。</p>
<p>油市升沉不一，生油甬帮間津　，初平後緊，盤漲一二萬元。豆油菜油軋升萬元，惟蔴油則蚌埠來貨見湧，下挫二三萬元。信局向中國冰蛋業公會訂購冰蛋五千噸，逕向國外推銷，總額五千噸，經陸續運出，已達第八次，共三二五〇噸，惟最初價格每顯爲九〇〇萬元，目前則漲至二千二百餘萬元，較之前價相去甚多，又以天氣及其他原因，微得雙方同意，將上項台同取消，冰蛋轍出事宜因之暫吿段落。</p>
<h3>茶葉去化尙旺</h3>
<p>各種內銷茶，日時丁盛夏，火傘高漲，本街店莊及客帮去化不衰，致全日經過穩俏，與隔日相仿。洋莊茶市情况依然清靜，良以各出口商，猶急於趕辦最近怯商永興洋行與非洲魔洛哥談妥之九百噸珍　綠茶，是以對於任何花色，胃納具減，交易亦趨江河日下之局面。但賣戶心思尚佳，形勢遂巍站如故。</p>
<h3>食糖回挫</h3>
<p>昨糖市因本週四配糖不停，執貨者不敢久持，都有脫手，價乃回鬆一二萬元不一。公會劃盤，二〇中砂白爲五十六萬元至五十五萬七千元，台赤五十四萬元，四半白六十三萬七千元，土糖因亦稍軟，而成交仍少。汕揭陽膏四十一萬元，棉赤四十五萬元，興化白五十七萬元至五十六萬五千元。興赤四十四萬元，次之四十一萬元，海南赤四十三萬元。</p>
<h3>人絲初疲後堅　廠經平穩無變化</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲初疲後堅，一二〇號高山及旭字等有光，開盤二千四百萬元，後因配售貨價尚無分曉，持貨者希圖掙扎，故收盤賣出價大起四十萬元。下午堅持，路有交易，繼續扳抬，卒做四百七十萬元爲最後收盤優，比上日大起五十萬元。天橋新貨及東洋等，均隨之而升。</p>
<p>昨市廠經頗形靜寂，行情平穩無變化，高勻度各級均喊土日原盤，惟乏成交，只有中級另祖有數担做開，價二千八百萬元，有五天期頭。干經喊價亦然未動，交易甚稀，二十八分另担價在一千七百五十萬元之間。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨又吿下降，華強被面開市後一千〇四十萬元有成交，後經多方拉提，由四十二萬元升至四十五萬美，最後四十七萬元，五十萬元爲賣出價，隔日期只有一二萬上落。大誠被面最後五十萬元有人要，五十五萬元爲賣出價。大誠格子璧　，乏人過問，一度跌進四千元關內，中間四十元有成交，最後　開四千四百元即期價。盛貨極形獲落，沖電力紡二十八萬元有貨，正號亦在三十萬元關內。華歸綸高檔貨二萬一千五百元有成交。</p>
<h3>紡調實施方案　民營廠希望勿作硬性規定</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡公會首腦份子，昨日對經部修正之紡調實施方案，繼續商討。聞財經部若干修正案，民營紗廠方面認爲仍未能全部愜意，有待再加修正，並望勿以硬性規定出之，致反與事實相陸悖。</p>
<p>據民營紗廠某首腦表示：政府現恃限額外棉及行總外棉所掌握之棉紗，實已佔全國產紗量百分之七十五，甚望對各紗廠自行採購棉花所紡之紗，勿再加收購，蓋渠聞政府對各廠採購國棉所紡之紗亦將收購半數。對未來棉紗配銷及議價兩案，渠認爲均應顧全事實，隨時採取機動制度，市面需要龐大時應儘量拋售，並按市採取彈性議價制，則市面自趨平穩，以目前之議　　　　已釘住一定水準，似已失彈性本意，此點實有待改進云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕紡調會定於本週五下午四時，召開例會，屆時對經部提供之修正紡調實施方案，及棉　據該會某發言人稱：紡調會首期試辦共同配銷棉紗二萬件，刻僅配剩約二千件。一俟配　，紡調會將以行總外棉所收購之棉紗，供給繼續配銷。據吿：該批棉紗，刻各廠已繳到二萬餘件，故配銷棉紗，決不致中輟云。</p>
<h3>貼放會例會　通過貸款廿六件</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行貼放委員會第十八次例會，於昨日下午三時，在該會會議室舉行，出席委員秦潤卿，伍克象，潘　恒等十餘人，當通過申請貸款案共廿六件，金額共五十九億元。</p>
<h3>中信局定於下月舉辦　團體分紅儲蓄存款</h3>
<p>九月一日實行分利抽籤</p>
<p>團體分紅儲蓄存款，經行政院指定由中信局所屬之中央儲蓄會辦理，頃悉：中價局業已奉到財政部轉來是項命令，該局中央儲蓄會，正會間儲蓄處準備一切實施事項，並定八月十一日起，正式舉辦，九月一日分利抽籤。是項存款，分甲乙兩種，每種團體於儲款時，該局均發給不記名定期存單，以憑支取本息。此項存款利潤特別優厚，除利息外，並有紅利可分。其分利每月分配一次，用抽籤方式決定之。努配時儲戶派代表參加，並請財政部及四聯總處派代表蒞臨。</p>
<h3>紡建售布</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售一二八八〇，申購單共三九七張，內廠商十五戶，布號三八二家。</p>
<h3>紗布外銷活潑　價格未見有利</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據中國紡建公司副總經理吳味經談稱：該公司近來代理政府外銷紗布，趨勢已漸見活潑，惟價格未見有利。以廿支紗言，南洋一帶平均扯價每件約合美金二百七八十元。羅方面價格較好，每件約近美金三百元</p>
<h3>生絲外銷設計會</h3>
<p>昨日召開第一次會議</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕蠶絲產銷協導委員會設計委員會，於昨日下午四時，正式成立，並假中央銀行舉行百次會議·到劉攻芸·褚輔成·湯鍚祥·薛祖康·王紫霜等多人，主委劉攻芸任主席。首由劉氏致開會詞，旋由譚熙鴻敘述設計委會設立之意義，最後褚輔成以來賓資格致詞，希望設計委會之成立，對生絲之外銷，有所協助。旋即討論義案如次：（一）通過設計委員會組織章程九條。（二）關於生絲外銷計劃，議法推請常麥萬敬中·蔡昕濤·吳升伯·馬克·薛祖康等五人草擬。該五常委定今日下午三時，集會商討。（三）蠶絲產銷協導委會送會提案四件，包括繅絲廠要求發給生絲二成，及繅工發等案，議決先提交常務委員會討論，作成方案後，再提交全體委員會討論。常委會已定本週五下午四時半，召開會議云。惟如以官價外匯折合法幣，虧蝕將達一倍以上。所幸政府尚能以所得外匯，另行輸入其他必需進口貨，以致彌補虧損。據稱，該公司近來南銷各貨，以棉布佔大宗，七月份巳達數十萬疋云。</p>
<h3>現棉疲軟</h3>
<p>昨日現棉市况平渡，交易情淡，紗廠以新棉不久即須登塲，存底亟須出淸，故納胃已懈，近日紗價步高，花衣因走銷呆化，價難升高，客戶頗欲逢高吐售，但趨勢疲軟，致交易反成閉塞。各檔做開送廠價靈寳二二〇萬，沙市二〇九萬，沖沙市二〇九萬，火機一七二有五千。　交價靈寳二二〇萬，山東脫力司二一〇萬，周浦籽花三三萬五千。</p>

<h3>綠化靑海</h3>

<p>靑海二十一日航訊</p>
<p>遍栽楊柳三千里　引得春風度玉關　—左文襄</p>
<p>膏海地居西北高原，純屬大陸性氣候，空氣乾燥，雨量稀少，因之十年九畢，民生瘠苦，惟夏秋之間，猛雨時作，灌濯　山，不但不能容納歸來之水分，且往往發爲山洪，沖毀禾嫁，淹沒人畜，其所受之損失，大至無可比擬，加以冰雹時作，癘疫劇行，其損失於人民者，更爲重大，在此時際，果能早曰推廣迭林，則一面足以防止水患，一面樹根入土，亦可儲蓄水分，使地面濕潤，雖大風亦不能揚土飛際，地面又因佳木成林，枝葉扶確，更可調和氣候，至於河畔築堤與沙灘路，更須有　於樹根之維繫，始能使堤防堅固，不致被水沖壕沉陷，靑海建設事業，年來正求猛進，各地人口，日益繁多，凡一切修一築公路馬路的橋梁枕木，建築住宅的龐棟大往，以及日用器具材料，均非有大　之木材，不足以供應需要，故億茲酉北　防　設開端之際，造林工作乃成爲靑海國計民生刻不容緩之急務。</p>
<p>塞外引得春風去</p>
<p>靑海之造林工作，發端於建省之初，推廣於二十七年，省府改組之後，民十六年前道尹公署，會於西寧市之大教塲，開闢苗圃一處，首倡政府造林之舉，十八年建雀伊始，凡百待舉，是年所植林木，僅貴德，樂都，循化，湟源，等四縣、共栽四萬七百六十五株，其時省垣北古城所植樹株，業已生長成材，陸續砍伐作爲公共建築之需，其所砍之樹株，又在空地如數栽補，至今亦皆蔚然成材，十九年省府訂定植樹獎懲辦法，通令各縣切實種植，以期推廣，並派員分赴各縣視察督導，是年共植楊柳榆樹兩萬九千二百一十一株，以後年年增加，在民國二十級二十一年，先後又種楊柳七萬三千株，其中共和，都蘭二縣，曾植白楊各餘株，此係靑海造林工作，深入蒙藏區域之始。而塞外春風，乃得普遍深入矣，以後植樹數字，逐年增加一倍，在三年內竟違二十萬株，至二十六年，因軍民致力剿匪，故造林工作，一時稍形式微，但西寗化隆等縣，亦植十一多萬株，統計靑海目民國十六年至二十六年十年以內，共植楊柳約有四十五萬餘株。</p>
<p>綠化成中心工作</p>
<p>到了民國二十七年，省政府改組，馬步芳生席以爲造林工作，實爲經濟與建設之基礎，故將造林一事，列爲六大中心工作之一，並決心實現綠化靑海的理想，於是擴大造林的偉大舉動，由此開始，先將各縣可能征收樹苗及可能征僱的人力，計算妥善，然後劃分區域，通令各縣人士一致參加，故其成績，斐然可觀，是年共植三十四萬餘株，其成績幾與前十年間所植者相等，翌年湟水沿岸興省頃附近，共植四十萬株，又與去年全省所植者相等，而二十八年所植之總數，已增至而六十六萬株，至二十九年，共植四十餘萬株，三十年又植四十五萬株，其中貴德縣所植較多，三十一年，又繼續權柳樹一百萬株，三十二年，省政府推動擴大造林，加以大通香山公園建條，故一年所植樹木，竟達三百一十餘萬株次年湟源等六縣，因建築靑藏公路及甘靑公路，工程浩大，需要人力甚多，故未再植樹，然於斯年公私學校所植者，計達五十二萬餘株，三十四年除了栽植白楊柳樹外，並增植松柏李杏等樹，約五百五十二萬株，西寗市附近林區，則由國軍八二師協助培植，加以保護。</p>
<p>四千餘萬株成績</p>
<p>三十五年春三月，國民政府以膏海歷年造林工作成績卓著，明令嘉獎，全省上下一時感繳奮發，因之本年造林工作，更形擴大，並發動學校造林，成績亦較往年增加十倍，省府自本年度起，特揭示了三個造林運動的辦法，第一栽植楊柳，繼續擴大，完成楊柳造林工作，第二種植榆樹培養硬性木料，第三培植桃杏李，以增加人民營養，及增加硬性木料並規定一，所有西寗市及各縣中心國民學校，各造校材一處，由當地耆老紳士，會同校長，選用附近適當公共地點，期於保護容易，二，每一學生植樹至少十五株，至多一百株，其樹栽概由學生之保甲內征收，三，各校學生，如有年齡過小，不能植樹者，由其家長代植，四，所造之林，易爲牛羊踏者修築圍牆，或挖鴻溝以防範之，經此規定，學校造林，是年大有進展。綜計十二縣之各級學校，共植樹九十六萬零一百四十二株。</p>
<p>此期間各縣市公務人員及軍民之植樹工作，亦同時並進，其中自湟中北川之莫衆泉灣，后子河起·經互助縣之長寗堡·趙家　，以至大通之　山一段爲止、在此橫跨三縣之草灘中，由騎八旅全體官兵及訓練團學員共同栽植，時達月餘，而所植之樹株甚多，蔚然可觀，爲靑海歷年造林成績最著的區域，計共植大小白楊樹株及樹苗一千三百四十萬零六千一百三十九株，爰將此段林區，劃爲特區，名之曰「勝利林區」以誌抗戰勝利後，後方兵工建設之光榮，且以爲本省造林事業，　抗戰　　勝利之紀念，　　　中縣共植楊柳一十一萬零陸百三十五株，互助縣曹家堡灘共植白楊樹二十五萬六千八百三十二株，湟源縣共植白楊樹二十萬零三千五百八十五株，同仁縣共植白楊樹一萬三千六百五十七株，玉樹縣巴塘渠，禪古寺等地，栽植白楊樹一千四百八十八株，乃爲玉樹植樹成績最者之年，是年靑海全省共植楊柳樹一千六百三十七萬八千七百九十一株，其成績之優良，創迭了歷年造林之新紀錄，總計自二十七年至三十五年，九年之間其所植之各種栽苗，共達三千三百二十七萬九千三百二十株之多，較之二十六年以前之造林工作，其數目平均增加八十倍有奇，二十年來靑海所植少樹木，多屬楊柳·松。柏等類次之，所採用之樹株分樹栽與樹苗，均用截條植栽法，公路兩旁少行通樹則多用移株法，其所迭之林，每株間隔距離，約爲一公尺，縱橫皆成行列，甚爲美觀，林區內均皆築劃溝畦，以便灌溉，是以各地林區內，歷年所植之樹株，因其水分充足，滋養亦日漸豐潤，樹栽之生長，更形欣欣向榮，蔚然成林，然因被水沖毀推折等之損失，亦不在少，此種情况，現已逐漸減少，迄今除用於公私　業者外，所存之樹株，尚有十之八九，數十年後，均可成爲建設西北之棟樑大材。</p>
<p>今年入春以來，各縣民衆及公教人員興學生重新　大造林，由民間所征集的樹苗，共一百二十八萬餘，所征僱民工四千六百名，此外並由公共樹林中採伐之，在先後一月中，所植樹木，又不下千餘萬，同時訂出獎勵私人植樹辦法及私人植樹一千株以上者，政府予以嘉獎，故今年所植樹木，進步良多，截止止現在輿以往所權者合計，已突破四千餘萬之數字。</p>
<p>植樹已達最高峯</p>
<p>靑海的造林工作，在三十五年與三十六年，可說是達到了植樹的最高峯，與過去二十年間之成續，作一比較，已超過數十倍，所以綠化靑海的偉績，將於今日完全實現，但是我們回憶過去造林的艱鉅，實在使人永遠不忘，即以玉樹一縣而言，該地因地處邊區，民風未開，氣候酷察，人民向無植樹習慣，亦無足用樹苗，結果只得向西康邊界購用，這種困難，確無任何事實可以比擬，所以省府特別發明經營楊柳之苗圃，以資培育樹栽，結果成續，甚爲可觀，此外對於松柏的移植，也不惜耗用重資人力，從數百里外運送，杏，榆，桃，李的培植也是煞費了苦心，原因是這種植物，先前只在西寗以東各地才有，西寗以西人民，大半畏於改革，囿於積習，不願種植，加以方法不熟，不能收效，於是得過且過，甚少栽植，省　爲了使桃，李，杏，榆　　　　，乃以財物與糧食兌携種子果樣，然後予以分配，強制栽種，結果僅就榆錢一項，巳達三，九三四，〇一二公升，迄今以上各項樹木，均已繁衍滋長，茂盛異常，數十年後，靑海除了楊柳蔭　外，並可看到桃杏遍地，和繽紛芳香的景象，而其硬性木質之運用，更爲靑海軍要之新出　。</p>
<p>靑海的造林工作，所以如此之迅速，除了全省上下的勢力和年年造林外，並致力於日日護林，那就目前　之，各縣已有公共樹林的護林班，其用具經費食糧，　由各府　發，所以植樹的成績容易表現，這一點是可供全國權樹者的參攷。</p>
<p>「綠化」的口號，現在已經高唱入　，而西北的一角，靑海，卻早已滿目碧綠，一望無際，現在他們佼然在苦幹着，那麼今後首先綠化的省份，恐怕要以靑海爲第一位了。</p>
<h3>民視民聽　台省參議會第三次大會</h3>
<p>— 本報記者楊育</p>
<p>台北廿日航訊</p>
<p>台灣省的參議會·二，二八事變後許多人懷疑它變了質，過去站在老百姓前面大聲疾呼的人，事變時卻成爲導引叛亂的首要參議會第三次大會在新省府成立了一個月零五天的時候，又吿舉行。受過血的教訓，迎着新的希望，其意義也就顯得更重大，我敢說每個人多在看着聽着，重給予它一個新的期待，這期待也就是今後能否做到切實代表民意的者騐。</p>
<p>不怕多說　只怕不說</p>
<p>監察委員丘念台，省府發表了他民政廳長，堅辭不就，大會開幕典禮中他以來賓身份第一個上合致詞。他把三次會議做了個比較，認爲發言的熱烈情緒一次不如一次，值茲省府成立，魏主席又是個開明之士，希望參議員再提起精神，參議員本身也並不忌諱，會向魏主席提出詢問：目下民心消沉，民意選關又有不能暢所欲言的苦衷，魏主席的答覆是參議員是民衆與政府問的橋樑，民心爲什麽消沉，應該找出一個原因來覓對策，至於他本人是不怕參議員說得太多，只怕不說。</p>
<p>參議員席次最初還按着二次大會的名號排，以致疏疏落落，一看就令人有疾風勁草之感，二，二八事件是越軌的暴亂，但也是個無情的大熔爐。</p>
<p>過去有所謂「百題議員」稱號的黃純背，這一次却緘默了，僅提出了四件議案。在開幕典禮的一天，他代表參議員向魏主席及機關首長，來賓致詞答謝詞，客套之後，大發議論，從米價說到豆餅，又從夏餅扯到猪肉，他說：「農家買不起豆餅，因爲一片豆餅的價格與一斤米相等，到是拿豆餅猪餵，反可以使一斤猪因賣到二百五十元。」一片豆餅原能生產一斤米嗎？一片豆餅就能多長一斤猪肉嗎？許多人爲這「答謝詞」啞然了。</p>
<p>失學兒童　二十二萬</p>
<p>魏主席的放駇總報告，着重在經濟方面。他提供三點施策：調節物資，平抑物價，救濟失業，要求繁榮，當從安定着手，安定有賴於經濟基礎的穩固。對於失學問題，他也有一個數字的統計：全省　　兒童有一，〇四五，〇〇〇人，就學兒童僅八二〇，〇〇〇人。佔總數百分之七八，六八失學者有二二五，〇〇〇，佔總數百分之二一，三二，下一代的教育也受到經濟不景氣的摧殘。</p>
<p>陳儀長官曾允諾台胞轉呈中央七月一日起實行縣市長民選；白部長來台定慰時也部以宣字第一號布告表示台省可以擬具提早實行民選辦法呈報內政部核准施行參議員要求魏主席兌現，魏主席說他原則上贊同，但無權答應，不是願不願而是立法的事實問題，對資格一項他也加以詮釋，任用縣市長要曾任薦任官二年以上，或文官考試合格本首具有這種資格的幾乎沒有。魏主席很理智的說：現在省參議會只能有一個準備，就是從長研究一個人選的標準，決定了呈中央作參考。</p>
<p>幣制改革　日期未定</p>
<p>任省府財　長的嚴家淦，在第二次參議會上爲了十五萬噸的糖，成了參議員衆矢之的，以設駕獲致「原子彈議員」頭衍的郭國蕊，在那時像出了不少「風頭」，這一次也許因爲他開獲了監獄，在財政報吿與詢問時，塲面似乎「冷靜」了些，但人們所希望的還是冷　的着意建議，而不是暴躁的惠意攻訐。</p>
<p>台幣的發行額與它今後可能的改變，爲全塲所關心。盤總長　吿了一個冗長的數字，從民國二十六年七月起至本年五月二十八日至一共發行了八，大八四，二芝一，〇九三元，內收兌舊劵三，六一一，一一八，三三一元，新發行券五，〇七三，一一二，七六二元。從本省物價的波動情形以及配合本省的經濟建設生產貸款導項來看，這個數字並不太過。較於與法幣比率的調整，則將視上海與本省物價的發動，求期靈活的變更運用，可以隨時提高，雖然嚴　長沒有說明提高的確期與數額，但最近可能一對六十的消息，巳經被人們在揣測着。台幣究維持到什麽時候？在日前張行政院長的經濟改革方案中，也曾與新彊，東北的幣制一同提及，但時期未知。</p>
<p>公費待遇　全國之冠</p>
<p>本省縣市行政區域的重加劃分，在省府會議中會由林獻堂委員提出，這次參議員也在民政詢問中提出，這個有關於民情，風俗，人口，交通，經濟，文化等整個的改動，自不能不慎　將事，朱廳長在不久前也會向記者表示過，將根據各種資料，參照比較以後再說。</p>
<p>省民人才登用的呼籲，反映台省廣大的失業羣與靑年的苦悶，並不始自今日，但朱廳長表示具體的計劃立刻就會擬訂。</p>
<p>許教育廳長在參議會開會前兩週間，需實地視察過中南部的各級學校，所以他的報吿中有比較切合實際的意見，如國民學校師資進修的輔導，將舉辦教農暑期講　會，帮助教師學習　　並組織國民教育　導團，中等學校的數量雖多，可是師資素質與學校設備亟待充實。關於公費一項。現在往內地升學的每月可得公費法幣二十二萬九千五百元，爲全團公費之冠，即在省內除師範學院外，台大，農院，工院公費生與半公費生各佔百分之三十，全公費生每月有台幣一千五百元，以及配給價的七成白米。</p>
<p>警務詢問着重在警員待遇的問題，有一個議員輕鬆的　出警察要用瓦斯槍，「免得動不動就開槍」，王處長內他苦笑笑：「現在上海沒有這種催淚瓦斯槍。」</p>
<p>台中築港　從　辦理</p>
<p>全省人民關注的工廠開放民營問題，楊　設廳長發表了三個處理原則：要繼讀開工，公開吸收遊資，放實優先機範圍。目下開放民營的有火柴，化學製品，印刷紙業及四個煤礦公司的官股部份，第二步措施選待研究決定。</p>
<p>大田溪水力發電工程有關於本省工業的振興至鉅，全部計劃可發電十餘萬瓩是本省最大電源，其中天冷一處可發電一萬八千瓩，土地工程完成百分之七十，電力公司已向台銀貸款二億元，準備復工，機器則已分別至日本及加拿大洽商購買。</p>
<p>日人施工五年完成了百分之六十的台中港，陳交通處長說明停築原因：預算五十億台幣，省府無此財力；日人倉促興築，計劃上有無法補救的大錯誤；木省已有基　，花遠，高雄三大港，足供吞吐，　　　　，所以　　。</p>
<p>大戶餘糧　累進收購</p>
<p>省府會議經過一塲舌戰之後，將隨戰收購糧食與收購大戶餘糧的價格，送請省參會研究，是此次會議中的最高潮，壓軸戲！踴躍發言，繳烈爭辯，爲了這是六百萬人的切身問題。隨賦收購，按稻田正稅（本租）一次每元收購乾燥稻殼十二公斤；大戶指究納全年田賦征實一次稻毅在一千公斤以上，餘糧指大戶所收租殼，除去田賦征實，帶征公糧，及隨賦收購糧食曁該戶本期自食量（十口爲限每口月消費量二十一公斤）所剝之糧採用累進法從一千斤以上五千斤以下的百分之四十至三萬斤以上的百分之六十加以收購。糧會局訂定了每台斤十六元五角（每公斤二十七元五角）的價格，會塲中一片反對聲。認鸞價格太低。糧食局拿出了數字，通貨發行額流轉速率增加，比率不足採取；公教人員待遇追不上物價，也不足依據；物價指數雖相當可靠，但爲鼓勵生產，乃根據生產費計算，每千台斤應該是一六，四六六·二〇元。</p>
<p>「穀賤傷晨，毅貴傷民」，「不實際種田，調查是不會正確的」。……二十七日整整爭論了一天。結果有人喊出：「大地主要拿出良心來」！接着是一片掌聲</p>
<p>價新通過了！每台斤仍是十六元五角，下面附帶兩句話：「辦政府防止因實施此案而致减少　量，并積極獎動增產」。</p>

<h3>杭州逭暑</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　儲裕生</p>
<p>七月廿六日訊</p>
<p>今年夏天，所天文臺報告：「籠罩全國及東九省之熱帶，氣流奧佈及日本，琉球，台灣的太平洋熱氣團在朝鮮東海相接觸」。無怪全國各地的氣候，都要比卅五年熱得多了。杭州的酉十湖，她是三面環山，一面鬧市。夏天的太腸，猛烈的射下來，被山上的樹草所吸收了，被湖裏的水所接受了，吸收接受以後要蒸發，於是熱浪不斷的澎湃着。有人說：「杭州距離海洋至近，如果夏天有海風襲來，甚至有一點獨特的像靑島那樣的海濱氣候那就好了」。可是杭州沒看這些有利的條件。</p>
<p>西湖像一鍋水</p>
<p>有人說西子湖像一鍋水，她被羣山包國着，太陽像火，不斷地煮着，這鍋沸水出不了汽，只有苦了杭州老百姓眞的，像最近幾天的熟浪裏，西子湖的夏夜，只有在淸晨一一一時以後才涼快，其他時問都在九十度以上，否則，你盪舟湖中，猶同在沸水裏翻滾。</p>
<p>在枕州，雖然她也是接受文明享受最迅速的城市之一，但究竟不如上海多了，上海的大旅館，大酒家，大戲院裏都有冷氣設備，甚至有很多有錢有勞的人的住宅裏也都有調節室溫的冷氣，不管他一天爲冷勢所耗多少，但還有很多人享受着的。而杭州者沒有這樣的福份了</p>
<p>影院賽過火爐</p>
<p>有一家電影院有二十多把電扇，居然也在廣吿上登出來，但是各家娛樂塲的電扇不能經常開着，只好時開時停，像電影院樣一直要待電影開映後，然後再開電扇，因此一入電影院，如入火爐，男的衣服剝光，女的旗袍解扣。又有一家杭州著名的菜館天香樓，以開放冷氣爲號召，但你進入了這“爿菜館，僅是幾把電風扇而已。杭州往年有電扇出租的，現在沒有了，一把普通的搖頭電風扇要賣到二百萬元以上。我會尋問一家電料行，老間說：「電風扇賣都不够賣，誰還有出租的？今年出電扇的廠停工，所以電扇價格如此俏。」</p>
<p>納凉方法種種</p>
<p>杭州消暑，在享受上自不能與上海比了，所以今年在杭州的有錢人，都到上海去避暑；據說莫千山也熱得不得了，有好幾個外國朋友都從山上跑下來了。一個六十餘歲的杭州朋友對我說：「這樣的天眞吃不消，不要說外地人，就是杭州人也受不了了。」不過，作爲這地的杭州人，他還是有消暑的方怯，譬如上靈隱的樹築中，玉　山的山巔上，或是烟霞洞，紫飄洞去納涼，有的到城院山上吹風，平湖秋月喝茶，這幾天來城　山上的茶座，擁擠不堪，那裏一邊臨錢江，一面靠西湖，涼風習習，到是很好的地方。平湖秋月，就全靠湖面上括來的風。在鬧市裏的人，即是以湖濱和裏湖一帶　安靜地方就算作避署勝地。其實，依我想來，杭州當也有她涼快的地方，不過沒有佈置成可以避暑的環境罷了。例如城　山，靈隱，烟霞洞等處，大可營椽數間，小居於此，自然也會忘掉　暑的侵人的。不過，大多數的人民還是浸沉在熱浪裏，不能擺脫這熱的襲擊，自然也是徒然的。</p>
<p>從頭伏到三伏</p>
<p>炎夏六月的天氣，依據中國的古例，是以頭伏，二伏，三伏來分別的，三個伏天一去，表示秋天就要到了。在杭州人對這「三伏」的處理，當然只有穿極薄的衣衫，普通人家，都有綢褲綢衫。住處如果太悶氣，那麽可以搬到街上來睡，對吃的方面，也就特別注意，有錢人家，往往是「頭伏火腿二伏鷄，三伏金銀蹄」。平常而窮困的人家就「頭伏莧菜二伏茄，三伏東瓜不刨皮」。研究爲什麽他們要如此吃法，有的說有錢人家有得吃，無錢人家沒得吃，有錢人家想出吃的方法來，於是無錢人家也想出吃的方怯來與之對抗。其實，在這大暑天裏，火腿，鷄，金銀蹄都是並不十分油膩而很淸爽的。萈菜，茄，連皮東瓜都是可以去暑的。</p>
<p>杭州人在暑天感着不舒服的時候，第一步大半都是提痧，即用手指提頸子與手臂，使之發紅爲止。第二步喝十滴水，以後才送醫院。不過有些有錢人家，在夏天就在胡慶餘堂買得有很多的金銀花露等，以資解著。近來酉瓜已上市，六百元可買到一斤，真正的海寗西瓜尚不易得見。</p>
<p>靈隱講經法會</p>
<p>靈隱寺內，特發起講經法會，請上海靜安寺方丈持松主講。開講那一天，我特地跑去聽，講的是仁王護國般若波羅密多經。他開頭就說：「在這樣熱的天氣，又各人都有「煩惱熟」，但熱天是容易過去的，心頭的煩惱熱一時不易消失。」繼着他又講仁王護國的道理，希望人人都能以仁心護國，則災難可以消除，煩惱可以拋盡。當時前往聽講的倒很多，復性書院院長馬一浮老先生也去了。在這樣炎熱的夏天，講經靜性，倒是很好的，只可惜終日勞碌奔忙的大多數人，無怯領略這靜心養性的學問。</p>
<p>陰暦六月開頭以來，杭州的天，看不到有絲毫雨意，我們不禁又在爲農田裏耕耘戽水農胞們辛勤的精神而感動。他們怎樣消去這漫漫的長暑呢？祗有在工作之餘，喝三開白乾，吃四個大蒜，作爲消暑的唯一良劑了。</p>

<h3>泰戈爾的「愛國歌」</h3>
<p>— 蕭黛</p>
<p>曾經調到過一篇論及泰戈爾的文字，說是澎戈爾作品之被介紹到中國，還在民國八九年間，這以前，文壇上沒有聽到過泰戈爾道名字。但另一說是泰戈爾的作品早在民國五年就有人介紹與中國讀者相見了。當時因爲未會親見，自然不敢妄加肯定。最近到　魯舖裏去收集些「古董」的時候，意外地給我發現了一册已破碎不全的，民國五年二月號的「大中華雜誌」，主編人爲梁任公。</p>
<p>翻開一看，裏面有「介紹太阿兒」一文，為歐陽仲濤所作。想來此「太阿兒」者，即泰戈爾了。該文除介紹泰戈爾之身世及其學說外，還載有幾首泰戈爾的詩。這大概就是上面所說初次出現於中國文增的作品吧。</p>
<p>這裏，抄錄所譯「愛國歌」，及原名日「鐵」的持兩首。</p>
<p>愛國歌：</p>
<p>皇　祖國，吾靈魂之所領，吾先人之所建兮！</p>
<p>忠則盡命，吾身當爲之獻兮。</p>
<p>吾喜則作而歌，歌　國之曼兮；</p>
<p>有時背而泣，泣爲祖國怨兮。</p>
<p>吾腕雖弱，摻扶祖國，力彌健兮。</p>
<p>誰爾　者，吾決斷之！腰聞太阿，執云鈍兮！</p>
<p>皇　祖國，吾靈魂之所領，吾先人之所建兮！</p>
<p>箴：</p>
<p>汝省師蜂，飛遊太空，　饑萬華之叢，釀造佳賓，故不能深伏久豐夫　孔之中。</p>
<p>爾毋居囚，逼仄而穢幽，獲日廓治之，亦新獄耳，覺得踰園垣而自由。</p>
<p>譯筆古典氣味很濃，頗有些　嚴復，林紓　尊傳統，重規律的作風。但簡潔可讀，仍不矢爲好的翻譯。然而在當時，是否有人注意這個「太阿兒」即是後來名滿中國的泰戈爾，那就不得而知了</p>
<h3>被遺棄的人</h3>
<p>— 魯羽</p>
<p>去年秋天，村莊上駐紮了一支XX部隊。</p>
<p>隊長姓邱，是個中等身材的小伕子、一張雪白方長的臉，不胖也不瘦；樣子非常英俊，雖然已經是三十開外的年紀</p>
<p>不到一個星期，村莊上傳還着一個消息說：聽說阿毛頭娘已經把阿毛頭許給那個邱隊長了。</p>
<p>「眞的？」</p>
<p>「有什麼假的？昨天晚上還有人親眼看見邱隊長跟她倆手挽着手從鎮上回來；後面還跟着一個勤務兵，腋裏挾着一包衣料。……」</p>
<p>自從這風聲　露出來後，好事者便開始在酒館茶　中作爲談大資料。</p>
<p>阿毛頭家裏祗剩一個年老的母親。娘兩個靠着父親死後遺留下來的十幾畝田耕耘生活着。她雖然只讀過小學六年被的書，但在這村莊上却只有她滬麽一個識字的姑娘。</p>
<p>她平時穿衣服終喜歡穿洋布的；頭髪早已剪得短短的好　一個女學生模樣，面上還時常搽一點雪花膏，她喜歡跟鎮上的一般姑娘們學時髦。可是，這村莊的周開仍舊是很封建的，因此村上的人早就就對她引起着一種鄙視的心理。</p>
<p>一個月後，不知什麽緣故，駐紮在村莊上的那支隊伍突然接到上峯的命令忙着準備向別地移動。於是，前一天夜裏，那個邱隊長特地到她家裏來辭行。</p>
<p>「什麽，你也要跟去嗎？怎麽可以呢？」母親知道她要跟去的時候這樣說。</p>
<p>「媽！你不是已經答應我　給他的，怎歷現在又要反對起來呢？」她突然這樣回答着她母親</p>
<p>這不是娘反對呀，我說你們還沒有結過婚，現在你就跟他去，這算個什麽呢？」</p>
<p>「他要我一回去。他說隊伍　的人走來走去沒有一定地方的，免得將來分散。」</p>
<p>「………………」</p>
<p>她母親半響不說話，心裏很　悔着。</p>
<p>「媽！你別難過，　鑒現在是新法，結婚等以後也可以的。」最後，她在母親面前　着安　式的　子說。</p>
<p>就在這一天深夜——一個沒有月亮黑黝黝的夜裏，阿毛頭終於跟着那價邱隊長的隊伍一齊離開了這所村莊。</p>
<p>阿毛頭走後，村上的人背後都在指責她說：</p>
<p>「阿毛頭這姑娘態變愈壞了。虧她母親也會放了她……」。</p>
<p>後來，據她母親籤人表示：「只怪她父親從前給她讀了幾年靑，小姑娘就變了樣。上次舅母來替她做媒，小姑娘不但不答應還說嫁給種出人一輩十沒有翻身的了。想不到這次那個邱隊長來了沒幾天每大鬼混在一起，我看出他們己經有了關係，爲了姓朱的面子，所以也就成全了他們。可不是，我只有這一個女兒，只要她自己情願也就算啦！現在做大人也很……」</p>
<p>日子像飛一樣地過去，今年夏季，阿毛頭忽然從上海搭着輸船回到她曾經隔離了十四個足月的鄉下家裏。她在經過村上鄰舍們的時候，用很快的步子閃過了；她心裏正泛上了一陣說不出的慚愧。可是，當她踏進村莊的時候，有人早已在田野裏望見她了。</p>
<p>『，阿毛頭回來了！』</p>
<p>『阿毛頭穿着白的大衣，白的皮鞋……』</p>
<p>『看呀！阿毛頭變了個觀世音菩蕯……』尤其是孩子們都瘋狂驚叫起來。</p>
<p>阿毛頭加速着步子奔到家裏，她見着母親的面，禁不住要哭了出來；氣憤，怨恨，都一起湧上她胸口。</p>
<p>『啊　毛頭！回來啦，娘想死你了！去了一年多從來沒有一封信』。母親第一句說。可是，阿毛頭走進房裏後便倒在床上用手掩住臉，半響不說話。</p>
<p>『毛頭！是不是疊船？還先路上辛苦了』？母親過去拉住她的一隻手說：：咦！怎麽啦……出眼淚』？</p>
<p>『………」她仍舊不回答，反而哭出聲來了。</p>
<p>『說呀，倒底怎麽回事』？母親很焦急地。</p>
<p>隔了許久，她才低聲帶哭迸出了一句：</p>
<p>『他巳經完全變了……』。</p>

<h3>登子陵釣臺弔謝臯羽墓</h3>
<p>— 羅君惕</p>
<p>宋君旣得文丞相，丞相復得謝參軍，主之得實如魚水，省之得臣如龍雲，倘非逆賊張弘範，京南　州未必　沈淪，參軍先亦居田里，敵下臨安勢莫止，勤王募卒散家資，獨自　中揭竿起，嗚呼，成敗繁於天，和戰緊於己，寗教戰敗不屁降，一旅孤軍惟力視。迨聞幼主殉崖山，又聞丞相殉燕市，參軍孤忠未義憤難已，不爲遺民爲逋客；麻衣繩腹走山澤。雲嵐烟樹似當年，感念故人傷舊別；潛登子陵釣臺　，時值天涼風更急，設奠　酒且招魂，悲歌慟哭舉竹石；竹石碎，肝腸裂，省父恥，何時雪，臣子恨，何時滅，雲慘慘兮天地愁，水濺濺兮鬼神泣，子陵肥　以鳴高，天下興亡不負責。如何過者只知子陵釣臺名，不知臯羽墓在子陵釣臺側。</p>
<p>停一停她又接下去鳴咽着：「自從出去後，沒一個月，他便帶我到上海　，我才知道他是個有妻子的人。當時我認爲木已成舟也就始終忍耐着。不想她最近又從不知什麽地方弄了個狐狸精選來……完全變了……」她沒有說完，把左腿伸起給她母親看；上面那些靑　的地方，她吿訴母親這就是他用皮靴腳踢傷的……</p>
<p>這眞像晴天霹靂，母親也呆住了。</p>
<h3>藍橋與花街</h3>
<p>— 李蔚初</p>
<p>提籃橋，這是一個美的名字，當我第一次看見牠，就使我想起兒時在故鄉常常聽說過的水漫藍橋的故事—這故事差不多與梁山伯祝英台齊名的雖然「籃」不是「藍」到後來走過了高大門牆的上海監獄，那門前常常有多少靑衣素裳，面含愁容的少婦，和幾位淡掃娥眉的少女，手擔着物品，哭紅了雙眼的在那兒竚盼站立，一個朋友說：這才真是「魂斷籃橋」哩！於是我就吿訴她，每次每次的，當我經過這裏，我總會想起那張著名的影片；「魂斷藍橋」，那聽明美麗的善於表情的　變麗，大而動人的眸子，和那使人心魂迷醉，鳴咽的流水一樣的曲子，這些，深深的印在我的記憶中。</p>
<p>於是，意像裏有着許多美的感覺，一路的走過去，那是一條很美，在這兒又很出名的小街，爲此，你不會往左走嗎？那麼，我希望你往左走，那第一家門面，就是一家透明的玻璃房的小花店，這鬥前，左邊一片的擺設了四五個華騰，白的，藍橋，粉紅的洋菊，淡黃的大瓣啦叭，鮮紫的玫瑰，大紅的山茶，此外，桃紅的夾竹，橋黃的野　薇，鮮艷美麗，總是引人　　，慢慢的走過去，沒多遠，又是一家，在這家的斜對面，那是一個規模較大的支店了，這裏面陳設的花草就比較名式繁多也較名貴了。</p>
<p>當我第一次走進這條街，那是一個淸涼的早晨，第一次的到辦公室，心裏充滿了新鮮，只當我鼻中微微的臭到一陣淡淡的靜靜的淸昏，便使我很快的感覺到恍如在故都的氣氛裏行走；有一陣恍惚　龍的陶醉，這淡淡的靜靜的淸香，傳到我心底，是給我一種多麼幽靜的意味，和撩起我多麽渺遠的夢一樣的　來的記情和回思呵，這在上海，繁囂的，不安的，酒色的上海，這樣的情調的地方，有的嗎？有的，而這是在北平呵！於是我回想起北海的古倒渡蔭之間，明月下，王帶橋畔的水晶冷王一般的淸涼幽幻的情味，而我想哭，可是心靈裏感覺欣慰—等到從這裏醒來，往旁觀一看，原來滿眼的的片白色，花窗門前，一片全是低垂的夜來香呵！……於是我愛道條街，我喜歡這個小小的街就姐同我喜歡一個共語談心的淸淡的友人，每天，當黃昏或淸晨，幾分鐘的偷閒，我　願多走一點路，也要到那裏去看看，在花攤上流逐，在花舖　凝目，在花品上留神，把這條小街我暗暗的在心裏叫她花街，或者說：我的心靈裏的花街。</p>
<p>而你，不要說：我沉醉嗎？做夢嗎？逃　嗎？或者說閒情　致，或者說玩物喪志嗎？</p>
<p>但，親愛的，在這極端痛苦的現實的生活裏、無可奈何的日子中，這只是一種慰籍呵，並不是癖好哩。</p>

<p>小老虎剛走，　羣果然又問起北平總部和鶴見的事。我吿訴她北平總部，表面上沒有從前活躍，除了覓取情報之外，暫時只算潛伏，川島芳子和松組其他　犬，並未去麻煩過。現在正和涿州宋部聯絡，計劃反攻；這反攻的事，大　爲期不遠了。</p>

<p>這段故事，我說得相當　細，因　羣關心甚切，向時也教　　小老虎和鼎元，知道一些兩邊的人物，和他們抗戰的精神和　備。小老虎常然聽得津津有味；說到百忍莊的淘氣小姐子珊，去試探　見的情形，他　番想開口問話，都叫　羣正住。耀羣聽到那四位小姐，突入虎穴，輕描淡寫地把萍子救了出去，也不　　悄色舞，十分欽佩。</p>

<h3>均等的犧牲</h3>
<p>— 王平陵</p>
<p>愛情友情，捨得吃虧的人，多數是貧窮的，有錢的人，也好像有吃虧的時候的；但這是變想的投資，他們希望獲得更我的收穫。窮人大概都有寬宏大度的雅懷，無奈窮人的生活資源非常有限，他自己也得設法活下去的，並沒有多餘的利益供應他們的榨取，事實上由於愛莫能助的緣故，對朋友的諾言，容有無法履行的時候，這樣，朋友們不僅忘去你過去的舊情，常因一時的失望，深懷永久的怨恨，最後，你認爲最好的朋友，都變成漢不相關的路人了；所以，一個最愛朋友的人，是最沒有朋友的。</p>
<p>友情的肥料是彼此的容忍和互讓，萬一，對方是絕對自私的，那麼，絕對的「利他精神」，也是維持友情的因素；因爲你的朋友，常要你做的王作，是你以滿足他的需要，出讓應得的權利，出讓以後，決不可公開訴苦，痛楚的酸淚，祇能倒向肚底流，而面對你的朋友時，還得忍住痛楚，假裝小丑式的微笑，使朋友在你的微笑上認爲自己的成功；並不就是你所出讓的酬報。像這樣的情形，便是中國流綫型的「交友之道」了。所謂友情是什麼呢？「那就是你對於平素當作朋友的人們，經常犧牲的一種不希望償還的損失。」</p>
<p>一個默默無聞的人，突然顯貴了，質電，頌辭，　信，八行書……會從天涯海角，等片飛來，你雖然不知　他們的尊姓大名，但無不是親親蜜蜜，打着稱兄道弟的交道，正因爲這個人有多餘的利益可以滿足大家的需要；到他離開發號施令的崗位，沒有什麼東西應付大家的誅求時，也就門前冷落車馬稀了。但有時候，你對朋友犧牲的限度，超過朋友報答的能力時，那結受惠的人，常有不好意思的心情，反和你逐漸疏遠，甚至還要故意避開你，不見你的面，爲的是怕引起漸愧和內疚；所以凡對朋友太富於婆心，以及犧牲超過的限度，惟恐朋友不能滿足的人，也是沒有朋友的人。</p>
<p>世界上有沒有純潔的友情呢？有的，聖人之徒說：就是道義的友情。然而這個解釋，使我越發模糊了，我以爲純潔的友情，應該是朋友之間所發生的一種均等的犧牲，即彼此差不多的跋涉和損失。國與國的交際，也是一樣。至於由男女之間由於性的要求所形成的糾纏，通常叫做愛情，施行愛情的雙方，彼此互稱爲情人，而實在也是男女之間所發生的一種均等的犧牲。</p>
<p>均等的犧牲，一方是表現犧牲的事實，接受的一方，在內心深處起了說不出的感激，正想尋覓報答的機會。</p>
<p>感激的心情，是良心的負擔，無力償還時所發生的內疚，朋友們以逾格寬恕的態度，寬恕了自己的錯誤，或以超過預期的仁慈，解決了自己的困難，感激的心情，便油然而生一；但是，肯犧牲的人，決不願意接受朋友的犧牲，到萬不得已時，也祇能接受，這不是權利，實在是義務，終希望有爲他服務的機會，了却這一筆心願的，雖然那準備犧牲的朋友，並不在乎你的報答。像這樣的行爲，便是朋友之間所表現的均等的犧牲，均等的犧牲，不僅能支持友情，且能提高雙方的互信，增加純潔的成份。</p>
<p>同樣的，世界上如真有所謂「我倆純潔的愛情，宣告續會」的美滿婚姻的話，我想，也不過是雙方之一方，受恩無窮，感激涕零，無以爲報的一種無可奈何的報答。當男女雙方由認識和滿意而進行友情的建築時，必有一方先顯示一個最高的要求，預感到有一個大缺陷而必須在另一方渴望補充的心顯，緊逼着他施展各種技術，製造許多讓另一方夠得上感激的恩賜，並且絕不望任何報答，待另一方已覺得祇有貢獻最後的一點，才能償還靈魂的負擔時，於是所謂純潔的愛情結合，就以男女之間一種均等犧牲的形式而表現於行爲上了。</p>
<p>均等的犧牲，是合　的交友之道，也可以說是人類的美德；但這種「交通」，已經不多見了，在此刻，犧牲的只有一方，另一方僅是絕對的利用而已，大家都企圖絕對地利用人，而絕對不被人利用，於是社會上尋求需要的人們，都岌岌皇皇，在人美中奔逐，殘殺，惟利是圖，捕捉他們的獵物。友情是什麼呢？是笑裏藏刀的外交辭令，強盜的化裝，貓哭耗子的仁慈，當罪犯行刑時，從職業性的牧師嘴裏哼出的有聲無義的祈禱！</p>

<p>邱吉爾於上次大戰後，即以「世界危機」及「馬羅波羅夫旅傅紀」二書聞名於全球。至於他有這次大戰中，充當「大不列　」號的舵手，領導這巨舶經歷驚駭風浪，安渡艱難的海程，更是歷史家生花之筆擋述的資料；他不愧是一個傑出的記者和一個　大的政治家，有人譽他爲自愷　以來，惟一的政治家而兼歷史家，也不過甚。以他在戰時最高政策的決定者地位，豐富的保衛史料，和他獨特的，著名的邱吉爾文體的筆調，將在回憶錄中，據露歷史的秘密，琑聞，　史，　諸世人之前，我們是深切的希望能看到邱翁的偉稱。</p>

<p>閒話林克教練機</p>
<p>航空協會訂購了下二十架林肯教練機，就是我們向用縮寫Linker而譯作林克教練機的，這種飛機的應用儀器，和真飛機完全一樣，所不山　的是林克教練是在地面飛行，而不是在空中飛行，外表好像一部小孩玩的汽車，那種汽車在美國遊節塲裏最多，可以百碰不壞的。學習林克教練機的人坐進去以後，把　子蓋好，他悶坐在裏面宛如盲目飛行，外界景物一些也看不見，教官用電話指示飛行。這種聯繫最爲經濟安全，在沒有發明林克教練機以前，教官帶着學生飛行過幾次，然後放Solo（單飛），那危險性就大了，不知犧牲了多少條性命，而且汽車消耗，飛行維護也也頗可觀。自有林克教練以後，每架購價才美金一千元，任何中等家庭，可以購一架玩玩，爲更其普遍化起見，遊藝塲裏也可裝置作爲一般民衆練習之用，我在空軍射擊學校時，課程中有Jim　Hanrly練習，那是用機關槍射擊銀幕飛機的玩意，製造得相當巧妙，練習時銀幕上發現飛機，你瞄準着射擊，射中時有着彈聲音，射不中沒有聲音，教師爲指導你的瞄準起見，加映一張片子，在銀幕上被發現紅圈，在飛機前面移動，向紅圈射擊便可擊中飛機，另外有計數命中率的設備，記明射擊多少發，命中多少發，實際則不耗一彈，而收練習之效，這種設備給遊藝塲用來爲兒童訓練射擊是歸經濟安全沒有了。不過任何東西到了中國便成爲賭具，你看見馬路邊的打靶攤嗎？打中了有香酒和糖果，打靶的人，目的在０香烟糖果而不在練習瞄準。（三）（二）</p>

<h3>蟑螂的奇妙生活（下）</h3>
<p>— 天虹</p>
<p>一想到人類和幾乎全體的其他動物都一致要消滅它，蟑螂至今還存在着，實可算是奇事了！　和　都是損審它；黃蜂，青蛙，刺蝟，鳥類，貓和犬，在飢餓時都要吃它，在厭煩無聊時都要殺死它，當作娛樂。人類更不斷的用最　式，最　騐的殺蟲劑來對付它，可是蟑螂仍舊存在着。</p>
<p>蟑螂有一個強健　的身體，以抵制它那些迫害者。它雖大腹便便，却是一個　　有力的運動能手。它放開六條　腿奔走時，就是最有名的賽跑家都　以趕上它，它　　緊急事變時，會開足了它的「引擎」，飛着逃遭遇人。它又能鋔縮小了身體，躲到狹小的裂縫或沒事裏去。</p>
<p>說到眼睛呀！蟑螂的視力　有「紅　光」和「雷達」的最大優點，已有上萬萬年了。它那　　　，係由一千八百餘片邊鏡所合成，參毫不困難地看　　　。它能在　　的裂縫里，瞧見一小片食物。</p>
<p>你可以把它在水底下浸二十分鐘，一點也不損傷它！</p>
<p>它還有重生肢體的驚人能力，如果它把鼻子伸到不應該伸入的地言去而被削去了，它會在幾天內長了一個打的——也許更好的鼻子來。許多記錄可以證明，臺果蟑螂的一條腿被割掉了　，它會補生出來的。</p>
<p>蟑螂的智力的可驚程度，也不亞於它的體力。跟灶鷄比較起來，它簡直可稱是天才。灶鷄不佳的鳴叫着，使敵人知道它所在的地方而危害它自己的生命。蟑螂却一聲不叫——所以安全得多。</p>
<p>當應付問題時，蟑螂解決法也比別的昆蠱明達一些。例如，一只螞蟻遇風了兩塊食物——一塊雖然美味，却大得難以拖；別一塊雖很輕便，滋味却不好——它會拖了那美味的一塊而走，在那沉重的　荷下哼唧着。如果是灶鷄，就會化許多時間來把兩塊都吃下去。可是蟑螂呢？它會當塲吃了那　重的一塊，而把那塊小的帶回去。</p>
<p>這種機智，可以解釋蟑螂怎會繁殖得超過了有史以前的其他一切大大小小動物，而「古生物學者」有時要稱二萬萬餘年前的「石炭記」爲「蟑螂的世紀」。</p>
<p>蟑螂是極　的航形的航海家，故全球處處有它的踪迹。當希臘人渡海去遠征時，蟑螂藏身在船艙時，跟去征服了新的天地。在「新大陸」，它們也在最早的移民中間。</p>
<p>俄的農民，深信「普魯士的」　　和着酒吃了，可治水腫病。許多聲聲者曾稱：「生菜蟑螂」滋味不錯，而　　的蟑螂可製美味的　汁。不久以前，美國的衛生當局曾在「費城」這文化很發達的都市裏，　得一種出售的葉片含有　　　成分。</p>
<p>雖然我曾那樣稱頌蟑螂的　處，沒也深知它會傳佈危險的疾病，故我們非努力加以消滅不可！</p>

<h3>Wei Envoy Meets with Political Leaders, Adopting Opinions on the Current Situation from All Sides; Mo Teh-hui and Others Discuss the Importance of the Northeast</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The American Embassy announced: Besides continuing his routine consultations with his advisors on the 29th, Wei De-mai also received a number of Chinese figures. He spent most of the morning in discussions with political figures. Around 10 o'clock, Zhang Dongsun, Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, and Zhang Bojun, all four from the Democratic League, were the first group to visit, talking for about an hour. After they left, social dignitaries like Government Commissioner Mo Dehui and Youth Party leaders Zeng Qi and Executive Committee member Zhou Qianchong successively visited. Purifoy also met with Wei Envoy in the morning and had a high-level discussion. In the afternoon, he successively received Li Zhenfan, former member of the Military Affairs Commission, and Tang Zong, Director of the Police Headquarters. Wei De-mai had lunch and dinner with Ambassador Stuart on the 29th. Even amid his busy work until 6 p.m., he took time to go with his advisors to Xiaguan in the rain, taking a small boat to cruise on the Yangtze River for a short rest, using the river breeze and clear currents to eliminate the fatigue of the week. The following is a summary of the talks between various people and Wei Envoy: Leaders of the Democratic League, such as Zhang Dongsun, expressed their hope that the goal of American aid to China would be to assist China in moving towards peaceful unification, and they did not want American aid to China to prolong the civil war. Wei said, "I am very willing to help the Chinese people, and at the same time I hope that the Chinese people can help themselves." He then talked about his mission to China this time, which was to collect various factual materials for reference in providing aid to China. Mo Dehui and Zeng Qi visited Wei De-mai separately at 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. today. During the hour-long conversation, they explained the relationship between the Northeast and the world situation in a serious manner, and asked the United States to pay attention to the Soviet Union's ambitions in the Northeast and actively assist our government so that world peace would not become a mirage. The reporter visited Mr. Mo Dehui on the evening of the 29th. He said that his meeting with Wei Envoy was arranged by Ambassador Stuart. "They exchanged views on general issues in China, and particularly emphasized that they would never give up the Northeast. People in the Northeast also have no intention of splitting." Wei Envoy attached great importance to the two points raised by Mo. In his conversation with Wei Envoy, Zeng Qi, in addition to analyzing the progress of domestic affairs, especially pointed out that the Northeast is related to the future destiny of the entire world. He also used an article published in the American "Time Magazine" on July 21, "What Price for Peace," as the conclusion to his conversation with Wei. The main points of the article stated: "If Moscow has four hundred million Chinese or Indians and their resources working for Russia for thirty years, then the prestige of the communists will certainly increase even more than the United States," then the United States will not be allowed thirty years to prepare to deal with this disaster. Russia plus Europe may be stronger than the United States, and at that time it will not be possible to prevent the "communists from including Asia, and the security of the United States cannot be bought at any price."</p>
<p>Zeng Qi Provides Two Documents, Expressing Don't Let History Repeat Itself</p>
<p>It is also learned that: In front of Ambassador Stuart's residence, in order to strengthen Envoy's impression of the Northeast issue, he especially presented to him before leaving two copies of the telegrams sent by Zhang Kegong, chairman of the Executive Committee of the Chinese Youth Party, to British Prime Minister MacDonald on July 11, 1932, and to French Prime Minister Herriot on July 12 of the same year, asking Wei to pay attention to the modern value of these two historical telegrams. The original telegrams are as follows: Zeng Qi's telegram to British Prime Minister MacDonald: "I sincerely hope that Your Excellency and European politicians, in addition to paying attention to European peace, will also pay attention to Asian peace. It must be known that the seriousness of the Sino-Japanese issue is no less than that of the German-French issue; if you only solve the European issue and put the Asian issue on hold, I am afraid that the flames of the Second World War will eventually start in the East and spread to the West. This is what I most want to awaken the attention of Your Excellency and European politicians." Telegram to French Prime Minister Herriot: "I sincerely hope that Your Excellency and European politicians, in addition to paying attention to Western issues, do not forget the seriousness of Eastern issues, especially the issue of the three northeastern provinces, and make fair, swift, and effective claims, so that the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Pact of Paris, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, which Mr. Briand and world politicians have worked hard to create, will not become waste paper, eventually leading to the Second World War, spreading from Asia to Europe."</p>
<h3>There Has Been Significant Progress in China's Political Structure; Zeng Qi Lists Facts to Prove This When Meeting with Wei Envoy</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] Zeng Qi, Chairman of the Chinese Youth Party, and Zhou Qianchong, a member of the Standing Committee of the party, visited Wei De-mai on the morning of the 29th. He first thanked Wei for his achievements in helping China win the victory during the war, and called Wei a friend of China in times of trouble. He then described the party's participation in the National Assembly and the reorganization of the government, saying that there had been significant progress in China's political structure, such as: (1) the government has changed from a one-party government to a three-party government. (2) the amendment of the Organizational Law of the National Government. (3) replacing the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction with a Common Program for Governance. (4) abolishing the rituals of the one-party system (such as reading Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, etc.). (5) the Kuomintang's party fees are no longer paid by the national treasury. (6) Regular general elections will be held to begin constitutional governance. The political parties that participated in the drafting of the constitution are now jointly negotiating the election process, and an unprecedentedly heated election is about to begin. China's political structure is undergoing major changes. The biggest changes in China's politics after constitutional governance are: (1) changing from top-down politics to bottom-up politics. (2) changing from the Eastern examination system to the Western election system. (3) changing from a government without a standing public opinion organ to supervise it to a government with a standing public opinion organ to supervise it (4) changing from a one-party system to a multi-party system. Wei expressed doubts about whether universal suffrage could be implemented, since there are too many illiterate people in China? Zeng said that the initial experiment would indeed be difficult, but its effects would be: (1) it could establish the principle of "sovereignty resides in the people," making the people regard themselves as masters. (2) it could implement "political education" so that the people's level would increase due to the election. Wei also agreed, and they parted happily after talking for about fifty minutes.</p>

<p>Special Attention Paid to the Democratic League is Nonsense</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] Watson, the news advisor to Wei De-mai, denied to reporters on the 29th that a certain news agency reported that the US government had instructed the mission to pay special attention to the Democratic League and collect more relevant materials. He said that the report was pure nonsense. The mission's tasks had already been thoroughly instructed by Truman and Marshall, and after arriving in Nanjing, they had not received any orders from Washington to treat a certain group of people differently. Their task was a general "investigation of facts" and had nothing to do with personnel. Watson also said that the four advisors who came with Wei visited the heads of various relevant agencies and key personnel on the 29th to discuss and collect information. It is reported that political advisor Sprouse went to Meiyuan New Village alone to talk with them after Zhang Dongsun of the Democratic League returned.</p>

<h3>Whether to Open Trade with Japan is Awaiting a Decision by the State Council; The Executive Yuan Discusses It Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>— A Comment</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] After the All-Economic Conference discussed and decided to postpone the opening of trade with Japan on the 28th, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan. The case was the most important issue on the agenda of the political affairs meeting on the 29th, and it was discussed for more than two hours. Each member present spoke several times, extensively expressing opinions on foreign affairs, economy, finance, industry, and commerce. Some believe that opening trade with Japan is beneficial to us. There are two main opinions: one is based on what Chairman Chiang said in his broadcast to Japan after the victory, that the attitude towards Japan should be generous and forgiving; the other is that all countries have adopted an open policy, and we should not give up this right. Others believe that it should be postponed, and their opinions are based on the current economic crisis facing China and the situation of industrial and commercial depression. They believe that it should be postponed. Without Zhang Qun's conclusion, it was decided to collect and organize the opinions of both sides and submit them to the State Council for a final decision.</p>
<p>[One Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] In the regular meeting of the political affairs meeting on the 29th, before discussing the proposals, Bai Chongxi, Wang Shijie, Xue Dubi, and Huo Baoshu gave very detailed reports on the recent military, foreign affairs, water conservancy, and relief situations.</p>

<h3>America Gradually Recognizes the Difficult Situation in China</h3>
<p>[This newspaper reported] San Francisco, 29th broadcast: New York "World Telegram" wrote an editorial saying: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's call for the American press to give China's problems more sympathetic consideration is worthy of our deep thought. China's social system is different from that of other countries. If its essence is not understood and it is measured by Western standards, it is easy to cause distorted impressions of this vast and complex country. When Japan launched the war in 1937, the so-called Republic of China existed only in name. Warlords and communists divided and occupied the area. From 1937 to 1941, China resisted the invaders independently. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the national army in repeated battles and finally retreated to Chongqing. At that time, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was in a difficult situation and could not start to reform the domestic situation. However, in 1944, the American newspapers demanded a change in the Chinese political system, saying that the United States also had a stake in Chairman Chiang's war against the Communists. Not long ago, the US State Department insisted that Chairman Chiang should invite the Communist Party to join his government. Today, Americans are gradually recognizing the difficult situation in China.</p>

<h3>Mongolian Bandits Plunder Princes</h3>

<h3>Amidst Discussions on Trade with Japan, Visiting Industrial and Commercial Circles in Shanghai; General Advocacy for Strengthening Import Controls</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper Reported] At a time when the issue of opening private trade with Japan is being hotly debated in the capital, our reporter has specifically visited people in industrial and commercial circles in this city to ask for a calm view of the matter. The general opinion is that the crisis and anxiety in China's industrial circles are indeed justified, because although there are import controls at present, it has been rumored that among the Japanese goods easily imported by the China Trust Bureau, there are as many as 30,000 yards of wool fabric, which is a prohibited import. Therefore, it is doubtful whether import controls can protect China's industry. However, the United States is currently very eager to restore trade with Japan. If other countries have restored trade with Japan, and China alone holds a different view, it is actually impossible. Therefore, there are only two ways to remedy the situation: one is to strengthen import controls. Any goods that threaten China's national industries should absolutely not be allowed to be imported. On the contrary, those that help China's production are not subject to this restriction. For example, if factories in Taiwan need Japanese machine parts, they can be replenished from this source. In addition, China should increase tariff rates and raise the cost of imported Japanese goods, making them unable to compete with domestic products. This is also an effective method. A certain business leader pointed out that resisting the dumping of Japanese goods can only be done through the import management system. It is currently effective for British and American goods, and it should also be effective when used for Japanese goods in the future. What should be noted is that American capital has participated in Japan's industry, and China is eager for American economic assistance, so restricting the import of Japanese goods is not a simple matter. As for the fear of smuggling Japanese goods, it is not necessary, because due to shipping routes, the areas where Japanese goods were heavily smuggled in the past were the Northeast and North China, which are currently under the control of the CCP. Even if the United States wants to sell Japanese goods, it is beyond its power. Smuggling in Hong Kong is not a concern due to shipping routes and the relationship with the United Kingdom.</p>

<h3>Fuzhong, Yangtze, and Other Companies Violated Import and Export Regulations; Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs Investigated and Reported</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] According to today's Central Daily News: Fuzhong, Yangtze, and other companies have been found to have violated import and export control regulations in recent years. The highest authorities have ordered the Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs to conduct a thorough investigation. The entire investigation has now been completed, and the two ministries have jointly submitted a report. The report lists the following: (1) the date of implementation of the ban on luxury goods imports and restrictions on foreign exchange settlements; (2) the foreign exchange settlement situation of the Central Bank; (3) the actual import situation of Fuzhong and other companies. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Date of Implementation of the Ban on Luxury Goods Imports and Restrictions on Foreign Exchange Settlements: According to the government's repeatedly promulgated regulations, foreign exchange settlements were not allowed and imports were prohibited for cars with a capacity of seven passengers or less and a factory price exceeding US$1,200, starting from March 1, 1946. Imports of trucks were prohibited from April 29, 1946, and imports of wireless radios and refrigerators were prohibited from November 25, 1946; no foreign exchange settlements were allowed.</p>
<p>(2) Foreign Exchange Settlement Situation of the Central Bank: 1. The amount of foreign exchange sold to general industrial and commercial enterprises and private individuals for legitimate needs, according to the Central Bank's Provisional Measures for Foreign Exchange Management and the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, from March 4, 1946, to November 17, 1946, totaled US$381,552,461.13. Subsequently, the revised Measures for Import and Export Trade were promulgated, imposing stricter restrictions on imports. By February 1, 1947, a total of US$2,012,040.80 had been sold. It can be seen that the sales volume decreased significantly after the promulgation of the revised Measures for Import and Export Trade. 2. The amount of foreign exchange sold to Fuzhong, Yangtze, and other companies: A. Fuzhong Company settled a total of US$153,778,723 in foreign exchange. Excluding the company's own and sold foreign exchange, the net purchase was US$111,330,731 (as it appears in the original Central Daily News). The purchased goods were mainly jeeps and station wagons, accounting for 50% of the total, and wireless radios and accessories accounted for 20%. The rest were permitted imports. B. Yangtze Company settled a total of US$180,691,069 in foreign exchange. Excluding the company's own and sold foreign exchange, the net purchase was US$1,074,200. The purchased goods were mainly cotton products. C. China Construction Bank Company settled a total of US$87,762 in foreign exchange.</p>
<p>(3) Actual Import Situation of Fuzhong and Other Companies: (1) Fuzhong Company purchased two "Cadillac" cars with factory prices exceeding the regulations. It also purchased 101 station wagons, but all had permits allowing import. As for 780 jeeps, 738 have already been imported. If classified as light trucks according to the rules, imports should be suspended. According to customs reports, 189 jeeps were shipped before the ban, and the purchase price for 549 jeeps was paid before the ban. According to the government's orders, they should be allowed to be imported. However, a review of the company's foreign exchange settlement accounts shows that, except for 200 vehicles ordered before the ban, the purchase price for the rest was paid after the ban, which is inconsistent with the customs reports. In addition, the company purchased 108 boxes of wireless radio equipment, including 40 radios, which were imported with permits after the issuance of the restriction order. 2. Yangtze Company purchased 50 Austin cars with factory prices not exceeding the regulations. However, three wireless radios purchased were imported with permits after the issuance of the restriction order. In addition, 128 boxes of cosmetics purchased were returned after customs inspection. 3. China Construction Bank Company purchased 56 cars, but none exceeded the regulations. As for the rumors that Song Zi'an, the general manager of Fuzhong Company, and Shen Chou'nian, the assistant manager, used diplomatic passports to conduct business in the United States in 1941 and 1942, it is currently impossible to investigate.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies Suffered Atrocities; Our Government Issued a Solemn Statement; Urging Both Combatant Parties to Pay Attention to the Responsibility for Harmful Actions; The Executive Yuan Allocated Huge Sums to Relieve Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Ye Gongchao, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, issued the following statement on the situation in the Dutch East Indies on the 29th:</p>
<p>Since the Dutch government took military action in some areas of the Dutch East Indies, resulting in renewed armed conflict between the Dutch military and Indonesians, the Chinese residents in the area have become victims of the Indonesians' scorched-earth policy, suffering significant losses of life and property. Indonesian troops have repeatedly carried out acts of arson and atrocities against innocent overseas Chinese, violating international law and humanitarianism. The Chinese government considers this extremely serious. We can still recall that before the Linggadjati Agreement was signed, Chinese residents in the Dutch East Indies had already suffered incalculable losses of life and property due to armed conflict between the two sides. Although the Chinese residents in the Dutch East Indies have had close ties to the local development and prosperity for more than 300 years, and although they have strictly maintained neutrality in accordance with the instructions of the Chinese government during the conflict, such incidents still occurred. Now that the war has broken out again, the Chinese residents in Indonesia are suffering even greater harm. I must urge the Indonesian authorities to consider the serious consequences of the unlawful acts of their troops and strictly order them not to take such actions against defenseless neutral Chinese residents again. At the same time, we must also urge the Dutch government to fulfill its moral and legal responsibility to protect the lives and property of Chinese residents throughout the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] According to diplomatic sources: In Kuala Town, western Maimang, a conflict area in the Dutch East Indies, overseas Chinese were previously besieged and in a critical situation. Currently, 700 refugees in the area have been rescued by Dutch troops. The Chinese Consulate in Medan is making every effort to provide relief and raise funds to prevent them from becoming displaced.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Amid the conflict in the Dutch East Indies, many of our overseas Chinese compatriots have been persecuted, killed, and displaced due to the war. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has specially requested the Executive Yuan to allocate special funds for the relief of overseas Chinese. This case was approved at the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting on the morning of the 29th, and 1 million Dutch guilders will be allocated directly to Chiang Chia-tung, our Consul General in Batavia, for distribution in various regions.</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Batavia, 29th] After investigating the situation in Salatiga, south of Semarang, where our overseas Chinese residents were abducted by Indonesian troops, our delegation has returned from the area. A small number of overseas Chinese managed to escape, and their residences have all been burned and looted.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The Indonesian government recently issued a statement requesting overseas Chinese residents residing in the territory of the Republic of Indonesia who have suffered war damage to report the amount and type of losses to its Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Jinan, 29th] The battle for Linqu City has lasted for six days and nights.

Most of their main forces fled to the Fuping area southeast of Quyang in the northwest. Currently, only Jiucun, southwest of Anguo and southeast of Yangdong, still have Communist bandits entrenched. In order to completely prevent the bandit troops from returning, the National Army has divided into several routes from Tangxian, Baicheng, and Yangqingzhuang to encircle and suppress them. The remaining bandits are expected to be eliminated in the short term. The National Army in Shijiazhuang is advancing in all directions to coordinate with the overall offensive in central Hebei.

<h3>Regarding the Intrusion of French Aircraft into Guangxi Territory, the Ministry of National Defense Confirmed the Facts; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Will Continue to Negotiate with France</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Regarding the incident of the French aircraft flying into Guangxi territory and strafing our soldiers and civilians on May 19, the French-Vietnamese authorities previously argued that the aircraft only went to Tuolong (across the border) on the opposite bank of Shuikou Longjiang.

<h3>Affected by the Closure of Restaurants by the Japanese, 20,000 Overseas Chinese Changed Professions; The Mission in Japan is Doing Its Best to Provide Assistance</h3>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of our mission in Japan is currently doing its best to assist the approximately 20,000 overseas Chinese who have lost their jobs due to the Japanese order to close restaurants, so that they can change to other professions. With the assistance of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of our mission, the Overseas Chinese Restaurant Industry Association has established a significant organization to provide guidance on the issue of changing professions. According to Lin Dingping, the director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of our mission, the progress of the large-scale change of professions for overseas Chinese who were originally engaged in the restaurant industry but are now unemployed is satisfactory. After the Japanese government announced the order to close restaurants, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of our mission did its best to consult with the Allied Headquarters and the Japanese government, arguing that the restaurants run by overseas Chinese mostly sell refined foods, rather than what the Japanese regularly need, so they should still be allowed to operate. However, the Allied Headquarters believed that there should be no exceptions to this law to avoid the adverse consequences of creating a black market for food, so they ultimately did not agree with the opinion of our Overseas Chinese Affairs Office.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] After the head of the Commercial Section of our Mission in Japan took office, in order to strengthen the connection between the mission and domestic work, he officially announced the appointment of Zhuang Yuling as a special commissioner of the Mission in Japan and director of the Shanghai Liaison Office, stationed in Shanghai.

<h3>Various Newspapers in Hengyang Demand Paper Allocation; Sending Representatives to Petition in the Capital</h3>
<p>[Hengyang Aviation News] The Hengyang Newspaper Association believes that Hengyang has suffered severely from war, followed by famine, economic depression, and difficult recovery. The Hengyang press has overcome difficulties, and as many as twelve newspapers have been published after the restoration. Later, due to soaring exchange rates and a lack of newsprint, a small number of newspapers have been forced to close. Currently, there are only four remaining daily newspapers, namely, the Zhonghua Shibao, Li Bao, Shimin Bao, and Datong Bao, and three evening newspapers, namely, the Jian Bao, Jingcheng Bao, and Dahua Bao. Recently, customs adjusted the tax rate on newsprint, which is almost equivalent to restricting the import of goods from Hong Kong. It has been found that all newspapers in the southwest region have paper allocations, but Hengyang does not. In order to ensure their own survival, a commemorative meeting was held last week to elect Li Yunpeng, president of the Zhonghua Shibao, as the representative to petition in the capital. He will appeal to the relevant authorities in Beijing and Shanghai to make reasonable efforts to provide news to the cities commemorating the War of Resistance.</p>

<h3>Three Convicted in Taiwan's Conspiracy to Commit Internal Rebellion Case</h3>
<p>Jian Langshan and Xu Kunquan Acquitted</p>
<p>[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Taipei, 29th] The Taiwan Provincial War Criminal Military Tribunal today sentenced five people, including Shih Chen-fu of Taiwan, who were accused of jointly plotting internal rebellion. The main text of the verdict is as follows: "Koo Chen-fu is sentenced to two years and two months of imprisonment for jointly plotting to seize territory. Hsu Ping and Lin Hsiung-hsiang are each sentenced to one year and ten months of imprisonment for jointly plotting to seize territory. Chien Chi-shan and Hsu Kun-chuan are acquitted." (Note: After Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced the unconditional surrender on August 15, 1945, Staff Officer Major Nakamiya Goro of the Japanese Army Command in Taiwan was unwilling to surrender and conspired to seize the territory under the false name of autonomy. After our national military and political personnel took over Taiwan, the Japanese ringleader Nakamiya and others fled without a trace. The defendants Koo Chen-fu and the other four were charged with the crime of jointly plotting internal rebellion.)</p>

<h3>Editorial: Reforming the Monetary System and Stabilizing Currency Values</h3>
<p>The issue of reforming the monetary system has recently garnered considerable attention from all quarters, with the key focus being on the timing: Should reform commence immediately, or should it wait until a more opportune moment? In other words, there is no question about the major premise of the need for reform; the only question is what is the most appropriate time to do so.</p>
<p>Originally, our country's inflation has evolved to its current state. Compared to the German mark after World War I and the Hungarian pengő after World War II, the degree is still considered much better. However, today's wholesale index is more than 40,000 times higher than before the war, and the trend of continued growth is still present. This has led to a sharp decline in savings, rampant speculation, shrinking production, and commercial stagnation, plunging both public and private economies into extremely difficult straits. To turn a blind eye and let it drag on indefinitely would be tantamount to doing nothing and awaiting total economic collapse, which is certainly not what most people want to see.</p>
<p>As for the timing of the reform, although it is worth careful consideration, we believe that the goal of implementing the reform must be firmly grasped as a standard for determining when to reform. What is this goal? It is to stabilize currency values. It should be understood that the reason everyone advocates reform now is not because they harbor any deep hatred for the current legal tender itself. It is simply that they feel that its value is too fluid and too low, and that its function has been lost too much.</p>
<p>If the value of the legal tender can be immediately stabilized and its original function as currency restored, then whether it is rectified, reformed, or a new currency is issued, or even if the current legal tender is continued, it is still negotiable. In other words, if, after rectification or reform, the currency value remains unstable, and prices, livelihoods, finance, economics, and so on remain unstable, then the future new currency will still be no different from the current legal tender. After a change, it will only increase public disturbance and losses. If that is the case, it will not only be useless, but also harmful.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the most pressing issue at present is not the future currency itself: Should we manage the currency? Or should we adopt hard currency? The gold standard? Or the silver standard? The real question need not be considered solely in terms of time. Instead, we should carefully consider what methods and conditions are needed to stabilize currency values. We must know that rectifying or reforming the monetary system is an important means of stabilizing currency values, but rectification and reform do not necessarily stabilize currency values. If done improperly, or if the conditions are not met, the opposite effect may occur.</p>
<p>So, what conditions are necessary to stabilize currency values? As we all know, all currencies have both internal and external values. When foreign exchange funds are lacking, causing an imbalance in international payments, its external value—foreign exchange—will be shaken, or even stagnated. Because of financial reasons, when the amount of currency issued is too large, and there is actually no need for it, its internal value—prices—will also be shaken, affecting prices, interest rates, wages, savings, and the overall public and private life. Therefore, to stabilize its external value, we must first replenish its foreign exchange and eliminate its imbalance. To stabilize its internal value, we must first consolidate our finances and stop the continued expansion of the currency. These are the basic conditions for stabilizing currency values, which cannot be circumvented or manipulated.</p>
<p>If the above premise is correct, then we can research the timing issue. That is, how can foreign exchange funds be replenished? To solve this problem, there are only two ways: to address the root cause and to treat the symptoms. Measures such as increasing production, developing exports, and absorbing overseas remittances are all ways to address the root cause. However, these all require accumulating achievements over time and gradually increasing, which cannot be achieved overnight in a short period. That is to say, no one can accurately predict when this period will arrive in our country's current situation.</p>
<p>The second is to treat the symptoms, that is, to borrow from abroad. If this foreign debt can be fully utilized and someone is willing to lend it, then the time when the foreign debt is established is the time when the external value of the currency can be stabilized. Some estimate that the total amount of currency currently issued, converted to pre-war value, is only over 300 million US dollars. Therefore, if a loan of 500 million US dollars can be successfully negotiated, and the other party is willing to allocate it to foreign exchange funds first, regardless of production equipment, transportation equipment, and other construction purposes, then the so-called rectification or reform of the monetary system should not be difficult to start at that time. But is this possible in reality? And when can it be realized? No one can accurately predict.</p>
<p>As for making up for the deficit in public finances, the government has proposed various measures, such as streamlining tax collection, eliminating embezzlement, selling off enemy and puppet surplus assets, selling state-owned enterprises, selling Japanese reparations, and reducing unnecessary projects, and eliminating redundant agencies. If implemented decisively and effectively, it will be of some benefit to the country's finances. But when can it be done comprehensively? And is the income enough to make up for the needs of total mobilization, demobilization, and various constructions? There is still no concrete explanation. In that case, the timing of the cessation of currency inflation and the stabilization of the internal value of legal tender are still questionable.</p>
<p>Therefore, discussing the timing of rectifying or reforming the monetary system today seems premature. The government has repeatedly stated that currency reform will have to wait until an appropriate time. This is likely due to the complexity of the issues and the fact that all the various conditions are not easily met at one time. We demand currency stability, and even economic stability, but the only way to achieve this is to suppress internal turmoil, balance income and expenditure, and, on the one hand, step up production and strengthen national strength. This is probably the only way to do our best at present.</p>
<h3>Outer Mongolia and the United Nations</h3>
<p>The United Nations Security Council Membership Review Committee held a meeting at Lake Success the day before yesterday to discuss the issue of Outer Mongolia's application to join the United Nations. Our country's representative, Dr. Xu Shuxi, stated on the spot that China firmly opposes the application of a neighboring country that has invaded our Xinjiang Province by force to join the United Nations and will exercise its veto power in the Security Council. This solemn statement will be unanimously supported by our country's government and the public.</p>
<p>The United Nations organization was born in the suffering period of the war, created a beautiful vision for mankind, and expressed a kind of awareness of mankind, that is, everyone believes that mankind can only achieve progress if they maintain world peace in international cooperation. The United Nations organization is an international organization that promotes international cooperation, understanding, peace, progress, and prosperity. But since its establishment, it has been more than two years, and people mostly feel that the achievements of the United Nations organization are slim. In these two years, many disputes have occurred internationally, and they have been submitted to the United Nations for handling, but none have been effectively resolved. Therefore, whether the United Nations organization can avoid repeating the mistakes of the old League of Nations is still a question to be examined.</p>
<p>If Outer Mongolia asks to join the United Nations because it cherishes lofty ideals, hopes for international cooperation, and promotes the realization of world peace, it should be welcomed by any country, especially China. However, Outer Mongolia has not only failed to express its sincere love of peace, but has instead invaded our Xinjiang Province with force, disrupting peace. The addition of this kind of country to the United Nations will not only fail to increase the status of the United Nations, but will also be enough to satirize the existence of the United Nations. Therefore, China's opposition to Outer Mongolia joining the United Nations is not entirely out of selfish motives, but for the sake of the future of the United Nations.</p>
<p>If we hope that the United Nations organization can become a truly effective international organization for maintaining world peace, then we must strictly limit the countries applying to join the United Nations and must not allow aggressive countries to mix among them. Although the Soviet representative argued for Outer Mongolia, the Baitashan incident cannot be denied. The Soviet representative cannot cover up the eyes and ears of the world with one hand!</p>

<h3>Fake Money Ring Cracked in Zhaihai Ning County, Zhejiang Province, 2.4 Billion Fake Bills Seized</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 29th Dispatch] The Zhejiang Security Command cracked a large-scale counterfeit money-making organization at the Xu residence, Wangdian Portnan, Jiajia Du, Er Gonglu, Changhang Ninghai County at 10:00 AM on the 26th, and seized 2.4 billion fake five thousand yuan banknotes, a printing press, three fast and slow machines, and seven male criminals including Zhang Baorong (Cao Hongshou is the local Bao Chief) and one female criminal, Wang Jia's family, and the main culprit is at large. According to the Zhejiang Security Spokesperson: According to the confession, they started printing 2,500 yuan fake banknotes of the Central Bank of Sa's printed by the South China Printing Company in August last year. They used white and beige Daolin paper. The portrait of the National Father on the front, the seal, and the signature on the back are all relatively blurred, but they can be confused with the real thing. The total number has reached tens of billions. The sales locations are as far as the Northwest. Dozens of boxes of fake banknotes are shipped to Shanghai by ship every month and resold to various places. Those who buy and sell in cash exchange 4 million for 10 million fake banknotes. If there is a wealthy teacher or guarantor, they can hang on credit and exchange 3 million for 10 million. It is heard that this organization was secretly established before the war. The one cracked in a hotel in Shanghai earlier was only the sales office of this organization. Many local residents are also related to this organization. The security team disguised themselves as watermelon merchants and investigated several times before they were arrested. The main culprit has not been found yet and is currently under interrogation.</p>

<h3>Dutch Government Ready to Accept British Mediation in Indonesian-Dutch Dispute, Demands Recognition of Dutch Sovereignty in Indonesia</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London 29th Broadcast: According to non-official Dutch sources, the Dutch government is ready to accept British mediation in the Indonesian-Dutch dispute, but puts forward two conditions: (1) The Indonesian side recognizes Dutch sovereignty in Indonesia; (2) Indonesia immediately issues a ceasefire order. At the same time, Dutch Labor Party members hinted that the initial goals of the Netherlands have been achieved, and the time for resuming negotiations seems to have arrived.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco 29th Broadcast: An Indonesian radio station broadcast that an Indonesian plane carrying medical supplies to Yogyakarta, the besieged Indonesian capital, was shot down by Dutch troops while it was preparing to land. The seven people on board, including two British pilots and one woman, were all seriously injured.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco 29th Broadcast: Indonesian radio announced that the Indonesian Air Force made its first sortie today, bombing two cities occupied by Dutch troops in Java. Indonesian troops shot down two Dutch fighter planes east of Mentokop, Java. A Dutch submarine shelled Labuhan City, located on the coast of Java.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success 28th Dispatch] As of this morning, the Indonesian delegation has not received instructions to bring the Indonesian issue to the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London 28th Dispatch] Those in charge here recently stated that Britain will set up to dissuade the United Nations Security Council from interfering in the Indonesian conflict. Experts on Far Eastern issues have held meetings to draft the instructions that Foreign Minister Bevin should give to General Sir Cadogan, the British representative to the Security Council. It is heard that Sir Cadogan will try to give the representatives of the Security Council the impression that the Indonesian issue is a Dutch internal affair. The reason why Britain has adopted this attitude is probably because it hopes that the Netherlands and Indonesia will accept the mediation proposals of Britain and the United States. In addition, British officials were quite surprised to hear the news that India had decided to submit the Indonesian issue to the United Nations. This was especially true because the British Party hoped that Indonesia and the Netherlands would eventually accept the mediation of Britain and the United States, so they were even more surprised.</p>
<p>[United Press, Yogyakarta 29th Dispatch] The Indonesian military issued a special communique at midnight stating that the Indonesian Air Force bombed three Dutch offensive starting points, Sampo and Latika in the morning, about 60 air miles north of Yogyakarta. (According to a previous estimate by authoritative sources, the strength of the Indonesian Air Force is about 40 aircraft. According to the Dutch side, ten of them have been destroyed.)</p>
<p>[Reuters, Yogyakarta 28th Dispatch] An Indonesian communiqué stated that fighting is taking place in the alleys of Bandung, and the Republican army has recovered Jibalaraj, twelve miles southeast of Bandung. The Republic announced that 763 Dutch soldiers in western Java had surrendered to Indonesia with their machines. A Dutch communiqué announced that it had occupied the Bandi Asen coal mine in southern Sumatra and the railway works of Laga. The coal mine is the largest mine in the Dutch East Indies, and the factory is used by the Republic to manufacture rifles and light machine guns. The Dutch headquarters estimates that the losses suffered by British and Dutch plantation companies in western Java due to Indonesia's scorched earth policy reached 2 million pounds.</p>
<p>[Taiwan Public News Agency, Batavia 29th Dispatch] At Buntup, 100 miles from Liria Port in Sumatra, four oil pools of the Mobil Oil Company caught fire. The Indonesian communiqué stated that the responsibility for the fire lies not with Indonesia, but with the Netherlands.</p>
<h3>Indonesian-Dutch Relations Turn Delicate, Dutch Side Expresses Welcome to Shari to Visit the Netherlands</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London 29th Dispatch] The Dutch News Agency said that the Dutch military operations in Java are expected to end within a week, and said that the Dutch Ambassador to India, Lamping, departed from The Hague for New Delhi on Friday, and may contact former Indonesian Prime Minister Shari, who is now there (see picture). According to a spokesperson for the Dutch Overseas Colonies Department, if Shari is willing to come to the Netherlands, the Netherlands will express its welcome.</p>
<p>[Reuters, The Hague 29th Dispatch] An official Dutch spokesperson denied rumors that Java and Sumatra would be divided into seven parts, saying that the Dutch government would not draft any plans until it had completed its police operations in Indonesia. The Dutch spokesperson denied that the Dutch government intended to change the Linditti Agreement. He expressed his belief that the police operation would hopefully end soon, and after it ended, he would seek to resume contact with Indonesia. At the same time, some socialists have requested the Socialist Executive Committee to convene a special meeting to have former Indonesian Prime Minister Shari attend and express Indonesia's views.</p>
<p>Shari's Talk</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New Delhi, the eighth] Shari met with reporters from the Central News Agency at Nehru's residence this morning. He said that the current conflict between the Dutch and Indonesia is no longer a domestic affair, but a conflict between independent governments. China, Britain, India, Australia, the United States, and other countries, and even the Netherlands, have in fact recognized the Republic of Indonesia. The Netherlands is now withdrawing its promise to recognize the Republic of Indonesia, but other countries that have recognized the Republic of Indonesia will certainly not be as fickle as the Netherlands. Shari also said that there are more than one million overseas Chinese in Indonesia, and they are the middle class in Indonesia. If a prolonged war occurs in Indonesia, the overseas Chinese will suffer the greatest losses. The reporter then asked, "After being turned down by both sides, what steps should China take to bring peace to Indonesia?" Without hesitation, Shari immediately replied, "The United Nations Security Council should intervene immediately." He also believes that if China, India, Australia, Britain, and the United States, which are directly related to Indonesia, take direct intervention actions, it will be faster and more effective than the Security Council's intervention. If the above-mentioned countries can take concerted action, the results will be even better. Shari said: "If circumstances permit, I would very much like to go to South Zong."</p>
<h3>US Newspapers Sympathize with Indonesian Resistance</h3>
<p>British Newspapers Uniquely Support Dutch Position</p>
<p>[Associated Press, New York 29th Dispatch] The New York Herald Tribune said that Americans cannot accept the reasons given by the Netherlands for provoking war in Indonesia. The American people deeply sympathize with the ideal of self-determination of the Asian people. However, sympathy cannot help the facts. The Netherlands will soon regain strong control over Indonesia. The development after this will be a touchstone for the Netherlands. If the Netherlands can put down its machine guns and abide by the Linditti Agreement after achieving its so-called goals, it will surely win the praise of the world. However, Europeans often claim to have pure and lofty goals when dealing with colonies. As for their actions, they are often the opposite. The New York Times commented that India's first call to the United Nations for the Indonesian-Dutch war was a shame for the United States and other Western democracies. This move will cause white people to lose their prestige in Asia and deepen the divide between Europe and Asia. The resentful response of Nehru and other Asian leaders to the Indonesian war actually represents Asian cooperation. The era of military control has passed, or at least is about to end.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London 28th Dispatch] The British Yorkshire Post published an editorial today expressing sympathy for the policies adopted by the Netherlands in Indonesia. The text reads: Since March 24 this year, the Netherlands has taken a conciliatory attitude in every way, but Indonesia has refused to implement the compromise plan established by both parties, resulting in the recurrence of disputes. The extremists in Yogyakarta even forced former Prime Minister Shari to resign, and the new government denied the promises he made to the Netherlands in Batavia.</p>
<h3>Riots Break Out in Northern Myanmar, Large Numbers of Soldiers and Police Rush to Various Areas to Suppress Them</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Yangon 28th Dispatch] Riots have broken out in the Tailla Wadi and Hansada districts of northern Myanmar, and army camps have rushed to suppress them. The area was originally a base for opponents of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. This riot may have been instigated by the National Party led by former Prime Minister U Sa, who was arrested. The police recently arrested many people in the area and seized many weapons. At the same time, when the new cabinet of Myanmar held a meeting in Yangon today, a 10-foot-high barrier was set up outside, and the guards were closely guarded. Myanmar's first ambassador to the United States will go to the United States next month to take office.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Washington 29th Dispatch] The US government recently notified the Myanmar government that the United States accepts U So Nyun as the first ambassador of Myanmar to the United States. U will go to the United States around August to take office.</p>

<h3>British Foreign Office Issues Invitation to Convene Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference, Soviet Union First to Respond and Accept Invitation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper News] London 29th Broadcast: A spokesman for the British Foreign Office officially announced that the Soviet Union has accepted Britain's invitation to attend the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference. The invitation has also been sent to Washington, Moscow, and Paris. The Soviet Union has responded first, and France has agreed in principle. The United States has not yet responded.

<h3>The British Economic Crisis Is Increasingly Serious; Attlee's Situation Is Difficult; Both Houses of Parliament Will Soon Hold Debates</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] Qualified observers here say that since Prime Minister Attlee lost the support of trade union members in Parliament, the crisis formed by the national economic situation has now taken effect in British politics. Two facts are noteworthy: 1. Last Friday, the General Council of Trade Unions refused to express its approval without discussing the government's economic policy; 2. Labour MPs in Parliament are scheduled to meet on Wednesday, and Prime Minister Attlee has been invited to attend. Currently, the dual opposition facing Prime Minister Attlee is the Labour Party "traitors" and trade union members. It is said that Prime Minister Attlee is currently planning to rely on the mediation of Lord President of the Council Morrison and Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton to bring trade union members back into the government's fold. If this effort fails, then the Labour Party "traitors" and trade union members may actually merge to form an opposition group.</p>
<p>At the same time, the dollar crisis is worsening day by day. The possible measures the government will take to ease the current economic situation are as follows: 1. Reduce food imports; 2. Reduce raw material imports; 3. Save on the economy in the occupied territories. However, many people believe that the first measure will never be supported by the people. Observers continued: Currently, only by demonstrating the "Dunkirk spirit," led by a national coalition government or a universally recognized leader, can the Labour cabinet be put into practice. In this regard, Foreign Secretary Bevin is the most popular. Labour figures also believe that he is the most suitable person. However, if one wants to immediately replace the Prime Minister through a vote of no confidence, neither the British Parliament nor the Labour Party has such a custom.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] Prime Minister Attlee convened some cabinet members tonight, most of whom were economic experts, to hold a meeting. According to well-informed sources, the purpose of this meeting was to draft the speech that the Prime Minister will deliver to the Labour Party Congress on the 30th. Therefore, Minister Greenwood, Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, Lord President of the Council Morrison, and President of the Board of Trade Cripps all attended the meeting and discussed the following four issues: 1. The shortage of dollars; 2. The problem of increasing coal production; 3. Foreign trade issues; 4. The problem of labor shortage.</p>
<p>[British News Agency, London, 29th] Before the summer recess of Parliament, both Houses of Parliament will debate the most important issues regarding the economic situation and the future of Britain. The debate in the House of Lords will be initiated by the Liberal Party, and the debate in the House of Commons will be presided over by the Conservative Party with the consent of the Liberal Party. These debates may begin on August 4. Members of all parties are quite anxious, saying that before the parliamentary recess, the government's various economic difficulties should be clearly explained, and the government's own views on the implementation methods should be clarified.</p>
<h3>President Truman Flew Back to Washington Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mrs. Truman's Funeral Was Extremely Simple</p>

The ceremony lasted only 20 minutes, with no eulogies or elegies. Immediately after the ceremony, it was announced that President Truman would fly back to Washington on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Three Jewish Terrorists Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday; Strict Martial Law in the Holy Land</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 29th] Three Jews, Haim Haviv Weis, and Nakara, who attacked Acre Prison on May 4th and were sentenced to death by a military court on June 16th, were hanged in Acre Prison at dawn today. Their bodies have been transported to Safed in northern Palestine and buried in the same place as the four Jewish terrorists, Groner, etc., who were hanged on April 16th. The authorities notified the families of the three convicts last night, instructing them to go to Safed to wait for the arrival of the bodies. At the same time, it is expected that the entire territory of Palestine will be placed under stricter martial law, because the commander-in-chief of the Jewish terrorist Irgun Party, Begin, has already announced that he will hang two British sergeants detained by him at the same time as the three were hanged, in retaliation.</p>
<h3>Jewish Refugees Arrive in France; Refuse to Disembark</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Paris, 29th] Four thousand five hundred Jewish refugees, escorted by three British transport ships, arrived here this morning. They refused to disembark because they could not enter Palestine, expressing their protest.</p>
<h3>Outer Mongolia Applies to Join the United Nations; Our Country Declares Withdrawal of Support; Invasion of Our Territory Clearly Shows It Is Not a Peace-Loving Country</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 28th] When Soviet representative Krasilnikov supported Outer Mongolia's application to join the United Nations in the Credentials Committee of the Security Council today, he believed that China's claim that Outer Mongolian troops invaded the Peita Mountain area of China was "fabricated" and its purpose was to divert attention from the situation in China. Krasilnikov said that this was based on Outer Mongolia's official gazette in response to China's statement. Krasilnikov continued that Outer Mongolian air force only appeared when a regiment of the Chinese army refused to withdraw from the border area and then only to escort them out. Chinese representative Xu Shuxi said that Outer Mongolian and Soviet troops attempted to occupy Peita Mountain in Xinjiang Province two months ago, engaging in "armed aggression," which was not the behavior of a peace-loving country. Therefore, China cannot approve Outer Mongolia's application to join the United Nations. Representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States on the committee are now expressing doubts about Outer Mongolia's sovereignty. American representative Renault said that Outer Mongolia is currently only recognized by China and the Soviet Union, and only has diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Renault said that he would like to hear the Chinese representative's response to Krasilnikov's remarks before making a decision. The committee has now postponed a final decision until the Chinese representative responds to this matter on the 30th.</p>
<p>Full Text of Our Representative's Speech</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 28th] Chinese representative Xu Shuxi delivered a speech at the Credentials Committee of the Security Council this morning. The full text is as follows: "Gentlemen who were members of this committee last year should recall that when this committee discussed the application of the Mongolian People's Republic to join the United Nations last year, the Chinese delegation suggested proceeding with caution. However, when the matter was discussed in the Security Council later, it voted in favor of its admission. As of last summer, the applicant country had been established for a year, but only maintained active relations with one country, and only promised to exchange envoys with one country. As a result, the world does not know whether it is peace-loving or willing to implement the various obligations stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations. Even the country to which it belonged for thousands of years and which celebrated its independence did not know the details. China still maintains that membership in the United Nations should be universal and has even approved the application for obvious independence. At the same time, in general, it expresses sympathy for all nations striving for freedom and independence. Due to the above-mentioned broader reasons, China changed its original intention in the final review stage and cancelled its opposition. However, the applicant country is so mysterious that some delegations have not been prepared to take risks with China. As a result, the Security Council did not recommend allowing Outer Mongolia to be a member of the United Nations.</p>
<p>Time flies, a year has passed. China, along with many other countries, unanimously hopes that the doubts held by our delegation are not true, and that the United Nations can safely vote to allow the applicant country to join the United Nations. However, what is the result of China's expectations? The armed forces of the applicant country invaded Xinjiang Province, attempting to seize the Peita Mountain area. This invasion occurred in recent months and has not yet ended. The excuse is that Peita Mountain is the territory of the applicant country and not the territory of China. However, according to the facts, the area is located within Xinjiang Province as recorded in the boundary record of both parties, which is very clear and reliable. This boundary was demarcated more than 30 years ago when the autonomous region of Outer Mongolia was established. Until the day of Outer Mongolia's invasion, no one disputed it, even when Outer Mongolia became the Mongolian People's Republic. The area has been governed by China for many years and defended by Chinese troops, which, although not sufficient to repel the full-scale invasion with all modern weapons, as we have seen and are still seeing, including aircraft operations, can maintain law and order. In theory, even if the applicant country has ownership of the Peita Mountain area, it should not take methods akin to war to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>The applicant country has never tried to negotiate with China, nor has it taken mediation and reconciliation, suggested investigation, or resorted to arbitration and legal solutions. The first action it took was aggression, and it sent the "beautiful ultimatum" of a 48-hour deadline to the local authorities. The Chinese government protested and demanded that military operations be stopped and the invaded area be withdrawn pending investigation. The applicant country replied that the area belonged to it. Mr. Chairman, the Mongolian People's Republic has taken actions contrary to the obligations stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations that it promised to accept when it applied to join the United Nations. Once this delegation joins the United Nations, it will not be able or willing to fulfill these obligations. This country has failed to demonstrate that it is a peace-loving country. The Chinese delegation only suspected the qualifications of the Mongolian People's Republic to join the United Nations in the past, but today it believes that it is not qualified to join the United Nations. Therefore, China cannot give it the support it gave it here in the past.</p>
<h3>The Breakdown of British-Soviet Trade Negotiations; British Minister of Commerce Submits Report; Failure to Resolve Financial Issues is the Main Reason for Failure</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Minister of Commerce Sir Cripps reported in the House of Commons that the breakdown of British-Soviet trade negotiations was due to the failure to reach an agreement on the terms of the Soviet Union's repayment of the loan it borrowed from Britain in 1941. Difficulties arising from the high price of wheat had been resolved by the end of the negotiations. All issues related to the trade part, including quantity, price, and transportation, had been agreed upon before the financial issues concerning the repayment of the loan reached an impasse. A contract for the purchase of timber had been signed, and a contract for the purchase of quantities of grain was also ready to be signed. The quantity of various mechanical equipment ordered by the Soviet Union from Britain had been agreed upon, and the procedures for the Soviet procurement delegation to come to Britain to sign contracts had also been discussed. The Soviet Union was indeed willing to supply Britain with large quantities of grain in the next four years, first supplying Britain with one million tons of newly harvested grain in 1947.</p>
<p>Since agreements had been reached on trade matters, unfortunately, the financial issues reached an impasse. Britain had agreed to reduce the interest rate on the 1941 loan by five thousandths, give up the requirement to pay 40 percent of the purchase price in cash, and had made concessions to approach the Soviet Union's request to extend the repayment of all loans. However, Britain could not accept all of the Soviet Union's requirements as conditions for entering into a trade agreement. In fact, except for the two points concerning interest rates and cash payments, all of the Soviet Union's requirements had been accepted. On the point of extending the repayment period, Britain had also accepted 60 percent of the Soviet Union's requirements. The steps taken by Britain would cause it to suffer significant losses in the next four years. Due to its own financial difficulties, Britain was unable to accept what the Soviet Union claimed to be the minimum requirements. However, the British government still hopes that this is only a temporary disappointment and deeply hopes that British-Soviet trade will be greatly expanded. The Soviet government also gave this assurance when the British Minister of Foreign Trade negotiated in Moscow.</p>
<h3>Internal Strife in the Greek Government</h3>
<p>Minister of Public Order Slams Table and Resigns</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Athens, 28th] Greek Minister of Public Order Tsioufas angrily left the cabinet meeting on the 28th after a cabinet discussion on whether to criticize the government's combat methods against guerrilla forces. Tsioufas's action is tantamount to resignation. He slammed the table and left. As things stand, he has no place in the government. Tsioufas had a conflict of opinion with the General Staff regarding the guerrilla forces' invasion of Greek territory from Albania. He recently publicly criticized the tactics of the government forces, which made the situation even more incompatible.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Ship Loaded with Nitrates Explodes; Major Fire in the Port of Brest, France; 20 Dead and Over a Thousand Injured</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] The Norwegian ship "Ocean Liberty," loaded with nitrates, caught fire and exploded at the port of Brest, France, at 2:00 PM today. Twenty people were killed and 250 injured. The commercial district of Brest is on fire. The "Ocean Liberty" came from New York, carrying 2,500 tons of ammonium nitrate.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 28th] After the explosion of a Norwegian ship in the port of Brest, the city is ablaze tonight. It has been confirmed that 20 people have died and 1,100 have been injured, including 100 seriously injured. It is widely believed to be the biggest tragedy in France during peacetime. By late tonight, the fire in the commercial district of Brest had been brought under control and was about to be extinguished. However, many residents, fearing further explosions, flocked out of the city. The estimated loss is 100 million francs. According to the crew of the Norwegian ship, at 12:30 PM, thick smoke billowed from the ship's third cargo hold. Workers and crew members cooperated to put out the fire, but it was not easy to extinguish for a while due to the thick smoke. Then the first explosion was heard, and the warehouse of the Chamber of Commerce on the pier was set on fire. When they left the ship, they saw a French gunboat firing at the ship. Although seawater poured in through the gun holes, the fire did not abate slightly and had already spread to the entire ship. At about 5:30 PM, a second explosion occurred, which was louder than the first. Many doors, windows, and furniture in the houses near the port were destroyed by the shock. The fire quickly spread to the commercial district, and a nearby gas station was also burned. It is reported that the captain of the Norwegian ship has died. The gasoline depot and gas plant on the dock were still burning at midnight. Most of the injured were severely injured by glass shards, etc.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Representative on the Allied Council for Japan Quietly Returns Home; It is rumored to be discussing the issue of a peace treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] Lieutenant General Derevyanko, the Soviet representative on the Allied Council for Japan, quietly left Tokyo for Moscow on the 29th, for an unknown mission. According to the Soviet Embassy here, it is unknown when Derevyanko will return to Japan. Derevyanko's spokesperson also refused to disclose the nature of the trip. It is believed that Derevyanko was summoned back to discuss the proposed peace treaty with Japan. Derevyanko's secretary said that Derevyanko took a Soviet plane back to the country at Haneda Airport, accompanied by one staff member. The Soviet Embassy said that during Derevyanko's absence, the Soviet side's duties on the committee would be represented by Major General Kislenko, whose position is second only to Derevyanko.

<h3>British Labour MP Questions the Reason for the Delay in the Trial of Tojo, etc.</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] At the meeting of the British House of Commons today, Labour MP Reid raised the question: Why has the Tokyo International Military Tribunal adjourned the trial of Tojo and other accused Japanese leaders? Why does the Soviet government refuse to allow the International Military Tribunal to try some Japanese generals? Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Hector McNeil replied that the Tokyo International Military Tribunal has suspended its session from August 23 to August 4 in order to allow the defendants to prepare and shorten their cases. Although the Japanese prisoners of war detained by the Soviet authorities have not yet been handed over after the International Military Tribunal requested their trial, as far as I know, the Soviet Union has not really refused.</p>
<h3>A British Parliamentary Delegation is Scheduled to Visit Japan in Mid-September</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Hector McNeil replied to a question from a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons today, saying that a British parliamentary delegation will visit Japan in September and is expected to stay for about ten days.

<h3>South Korea Establishes the Korean Gold Bank</h3>
<p>And Stipulates the Types of Imports and Exports</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 29th] The Minister of Commerce told reporters today that the resumption of foreign trade was originally scheduled to begin last August, but the resumption date was delayed due to the lack of a foreign exchange bank. The Korean Gold Bank has now been established to prepare to implement the financing of foreign trade. There is a proposal to trade with national countries, but this affects the general economy, so it still needs to be considered closely. Also, in June of this year, the Provisional Government stipulated that foreign trade would officially begin on July 25. Trade with Macau began in April this year, importing essential goods to Korea and exporting red ginseng. At the same time, red ginseng is also exported to Hong Kong. Trade with China also began in mid-June.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 29th] The Export Goods Price Review Committee will stipulate the prices of export goods based on the principle of not harming the Korean economy. The main materials for import and export are divided into two categories: encouraged and prohibited, as follows: Encouraged imports: rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, hides and their products, oils and fats, medicinal materials, tin, electric lights, fertilizers. Prohibited imports: seafood, rapeseed, coral, sea cucumbers, cosmetics. Encouraged exports: seafood, fur, ginseng, raw silk, pottery. Prohibited exports: domestic livestock, game animals, sesame oil, dyes.</p>
<h3>International Trade Conference</h3>
<p>To be Held in Havana in November</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 28th] The United Nations Economic and Social Council held a meeting this afternoon and immediately decided that the next International Trade and Employment Conference will be held in Havana on November 21 this year.</p>
<h3>The Head of the Allied General's Foreign Trade Group Says Japan Will Receive a New Cotton Loan from the United States; The Terms of the Loan are More Favorable Than Before</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] According to McDermott, if Japan obtains a new cotton loan from the United States, the terms will be more favorable than the last loan. McDermott is the head of the Allied General Headquarters Foreign Trade Group. Since the arrival of eight people from the US cotton trade in Japan on July 20, he has been in constant contact with them. He hopes to be able to confirm and announce the establishment of the new cotton loan within this week. For six months, the Allied General Headquarters has been carefully considering the hope of revitalizing the Japanese textile industry, and the textile industry accounts for 70 percent of Japan's total export plan.</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Revise Its Export Policies and Re-determine Its Import and Export Trade Plans</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The Japanese government has been studying countermeasures to promote exports and will formally decide on them soon. However, since export industries must adopt the re-processing of imported raw materials, the biggest problem in the countermeasures to promote exports is to establish a processing trade pattern. The specific countermeasures are based on the processing factory system and adopt the following price and financial countermeasures: Establishment of a processing factory system: In order to ensure the production of export products regarding fiber products and other major sectors, designate processing factories and prioritize the allocation of imported raw materials; also, the import plan for raw materials for export products should be planned separately from general materials to prevent the raw materials for export products from flowing into other industries. Price Countermeasures: Although the purchase price of export products is in principle based on the controlled price, this cannot be expected to improve the quality of trade. Therefore, the Price and Trade Bureau should organize an Export Products Price Review Committee to determine the price. Financial Countermeasures: In order to provide funds to trade-related businesses, create a promissory note system to provide transportation funds.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] According to officials of the Board of Trade, the Japanese government plans to import 61,190,361,000 yen in 1948 (from July this year to June next year). This plan must be approved by the Allied Forces Headquarters before it can take effect. Among the imports, the main ones are food and raw materials. Among them, textile raw materials such as raw cotton and wool require 15,120,135,000 yen. Oil imports require 16,709,188,000 yen. The third most important import is food, which is expected to cost 850 million yen. The remaining funds will be used to purchase rubber, coal, and fertilizer. Japan's exports are mainly metal products and the number of parts and components imported is 8.7 billion yen more than the number of exports. The original plan of Japanese trade was to make exports greater than imports, but due to insufficient export capacity, a new plan was re-determined.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 28th] Under-Secretary of State Hector McNeil told Members of Parliament that since the end of March this year, more than 10,000 British troops stationed in Greece have withdrawn, and there are still about 5,000 troops in Greece, in addition to the personnel of the military mission.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Investigation Report Completed; Related to the Chief Executive Meeting Review; Continued Investigation of the First Shot Issue; Witnesses to be Summoned Today; Military Judge from the Ministry of National Defense Can Arrive Today</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] The central government sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate the bloody case of the police-military conflict. The two who arrived in Shanghai yesterday were Major General Li Chengren, Senior Staff Officer of the Military Police Headquarters, and Major General Wang Zhe, Supervisor of the Police Headquarters. Military Police Commander Zhang Zhen called Commander Xuan long-distance, asking him to handle the matter fully. However, Commander Xuan believed that he had not yet handed over his duties at the police bureau and that it would be unfair to do so. Yesterday, he telegraphed Chairman Jiang for instructions again. It is said that Chairman Jiang has decided to order the Ministry of National Defense to send a military judge to Shanghai, who may arrive today.</p>
<p>According to a report from Nanjing on the 29th of this newspaper, after receiving Commander Yi's report on the incident, the Ministry of National Defense Inspection Bureau ordered the resident Shanghai inspectors to investigate the incident at the Jindu Theater in Shanghai.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Military Police Headquarters Senior Staff Officer Li Chengren and Police Headquarters Supervisor Wang Zhe listened to reports from the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police and the Police Bureau, respectively, and went to the scene of the incident to investigate. At 4:00 PM, they went to the Garrison Headquarters and met with Tao Yishan, Director of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters, Wu Guangyun, Commander of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, Zhang Shi, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, Xu Shigao, Section Chief of the Military Law Department, and others, a total of six people, to hold a meeting in Commander Xuan's office. The meeting ended at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Director Tao met with reporters and said that the preliminary report of the investigation committee had been completed. Today's meeting was to review the reports from the police bureau, the military police regiment, and the investigation team. The issue of responsibility cannot be determined for the time being, and the results of the review have not yet been released. The mystery of who fired the first shot, which is the point of contention between the two sides, will continue to be investigated separately by the investigation team. Tomorrow (referring to today), the Military Law Department will summon relevant witnesses for questioning, and personnel sent by the Ministry of National Defense will be awaited to preside over the investigation.</p>
<h3>Tasks of the Military Police and Police Officials</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Military Police Headquarters Staff Officer Li Chengren and Police Headquarters Supervisor Wang Zhe gave separate speeches to reporters. Li said that his mission in Shanghai was twofold: one was to represent Commander Zhang Zhen in comforting the wounded and dead, and the other was to investigate the cause of the conflict and report to Commander Zhang. As for the issue of right and wrong, it should be judged impartially by the Garrison Department. Wang said that his mission was threefold: one was to comfort the wounded and dead, the second was to persuade them to return to their posts, and the third was to investigate the truth.</p>
<h3>Police Officers Return to Duty, Military Police Remain in Barracks</h3>
<p>Following the "Golden City Bloodshed Incident," some police officers from the Xincheng, Laozha, Huangpu, and Songshan precincts who had temporarily suspended their duties have resumed their service on the 29th, after repeated persuasion from Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and Director Yu. The military police regiment, on the other hand, remained calm, with most of them staying in their barracks on the 29th and not going out.</p>
<h3>Supervising Inspector Yan Investigates the Truth, Submits Telegram to the Control Yuan, Suggests Three Points</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Jiangsu Supervising Inspector Yan Zhuang told reporters: After the military police and police conflict occurred, he immediately visited the municipal authorities to inquire about the truth. The mayor informed him that after a detailed investigation, it was proven that the police did not fire during the conflict, while the military police used automatic weapons, so the fault undoubtedly lay with the military police. At that time, I immediately suggested three points to Mayor Wu: (1) Severely punish the offending military police and their direct superiors. (2) The 23rd Military Police Regiment should be immediately transferred out of this city and replaced by other military police. Because the police and military police have harbored resentment after this conflict, if they are not transferred away, it will surely lead to disaster. It is said that a similar incident occurred in Chengdu in the past, which can serve as a lesson. (3) In the future, the duties of the police and military police must be strictly divided. The military police can only manage soldiers, and the police also have their own duties. Neither side can overstep the scope of their own authority. Today, I will telegraph the Control Yuan based on these three points, and request</p>
<h3>Claim of American Military Police Being Shot At: Director Tao Investigates the Truth</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the incident of a joint Sino-American military police patrol jeep being shot at while passing through the scene of the incident, there are conflicting reports from the American Naval Military Police. Yesterday afternoon, Commander Xuan dispatched Director Tao Yishan to the American Military Police to inquire about the truth.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The 23rd Military Police Regiment has refuted the police bureau's claim that the police were not carrying firearms at the time of the incident. It is claimed that there are seven points that can prove that the police were also carrying firearms at the time: (1) Bullet holes were found on the walls of the Golden City. (2) Five pistol shell casings were found at the scene of the incident. (3) The American Naval jeep was shot at. (4) Jin Suhua, the squad leader of the Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Command, testified that he found a pistol. (5) The police at the time were not just unarmed traffic police. (6) Xia, the deputy director of the Xincheng Precinct, claimed that he could not restrain them. (7) Zhuo, the director of the Xincheng Precinct, instructed both sides on the phone to not open fire, which shows that the police were also carrying firearms.</p>
<h3>Time Bombs Found in Two Locations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday morning, two time bombs were found in front of the Italian Consulate opposite the Xincheng Precinct and in front of the Cosman Ballroom. Also, yesterday, a store near the Golden City Theater was robbed by unidentified individuals. The Garrison Command has launched a strict investigation.

On July 7th of this year, a letter was received from Commander Xuan, stating that the Xinmin News Corporation admitted that the opinions published in the Shanghai Xinmin Evening News had been inappropriate in the past, and decided to adjust the staff of the editorial and interviewing departments, and applied for resumption of publication. He solicited opinions by letter for reference. On July 15th, we replied, asking the Garrison Headquarters to consider the situation and handle it accordingly. Later, the Xinmin News Corporation again appealed to the News Bureau of the Executive Yuan, which forwarded it to the Executive Yuan for approval of resumption of publication. The Executive Yuan then ordered the Ministry of National Defense, which in turn ordered the Garrison Headquarters to approve the resumption of publication. Therefore, on the 26th, Commander Xuan sent another letter, clarifying that the resumption of publication of the newspaper had been approved. As the Xinmin Evening News admitted that its previous opinions and news handling were improper and was willing to be responsible for rectification in the future, striving to cooperate with national policies and promote government orders, the resumption of publication of the Xinmin Evening News is not inconsistent with the spirit of our previous resolution. Taking this tea party as an opportunity, I would like to make a report to all councilors. After Speaker Pan finished his speech, he invited Mayor Wu to speak. Mayor Wu mentioned the military police conflict incident at the Jindu Theater the other day, saying: The most important thing at the moment is to simplify the complicated situation. As for the issue of responsibility, the central government has sent senior officials to Shanghai to investigate the situation together with the three parties, determine the right and wrong, and then handle it according to military law. The police strike has gradually improved after persuasion and guidance. As of this afternoon (29th), it has fully returned to normal, which is gratifying to everyone. Now, we must clearly define the responsibilities of the military and police to prevent the same incident from happening again.</p>
<p>Commander Xuan's Report</p>
<p>The Xinmin Evening News was suspended from publication at the same time as the Wenhui Daily and the United Evening News in May. Now, the newspaper has repented and improved, and the Executive Yuan has approved its resumption of publication. As for the military police conflict, it is a regrettable incident. The cause of this matter was very small, but the conflict resulted in the deaths of seven police officers and one civilian, and injuries to six police officers and three civilians. Based on this, the calamity was caused by a lack of knowledge of their own powers by some military and police personnel. The police officers were emotionally agitated after the incident. The situation was serious at one point yesterday morning (28th), but it improved in the afternoon, and the situation is not expected to escalate. A three-person team has been organized to investigate the issue of responsibility. The military police and police are originally under the jurisdiction of the Garrison Headquarters, but since I have not yet relinquished the title of police chief, I have telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense to send personnel to investigate the truth and make a ruling according to law. The biggest problem in this case is the unclear division of powers between the military police and police. After this incident, it is hoped that the system can be improved.</p>
<p>Councilors Raised Questions One After Another</p>
<p>Subsequently, Councilor Zhang Shizuo, representing the Police Affairs Committee of the City Council, reported on the investigation of the military police conflict. Afterwards, councilors stood up one after another to express their opinions, and some councilors' attitudes towards the military police conflict were particularly激昂. Speaker Shen expressed: (1) Before the responsible investigation agency publishes the truth of this unfortunate incident, it is hoped that fewer opinions will be expressed temporarily, so as not to show partiality; (2) The City Council is an organ representing the public opinion of this city, and it is hoped that the citizens can live and work in peace. The main reason for the occurrence of this unfortunate incident is that the powers of the military and police have not been clearly defined. It is hoped that this incident will prompt the central government to pay attention to improvement; (4) Citizens should respect the spirit of abiding by the law. Watching a play should require purchasing a ticket. This time, three audience members only had two tickets and wanted to enter the venue, which was already undermining the spirit of abiding by the law, and eventually created the fuse for this unfortunate incident. It is heard that one of the audience members is a section chief of the Public Works Bureau. If this is true, the Public Works Bureau should be asked to investigate and deal with it severely. Furthermore, the recent hit-and-run death of Mr. Li Haoran, the former editor-in-chief of the News Daily, was caused by a driver without a legal license. Such disregard for human life should also be paid close attention to by the relevant authorities. Afterwards, councilors Wu Zhengzhuo, Pang Jingzhou, Zhu Zongde, Tong Xiang, Zhang Zhihan, and others spoke successively, expressing their indignation at the illegal destruction of the Jindu Theater, and hoped that the responsible authorities would investigate the truth and handle it impartially. Councilor Wang Xianqing also put forward three points of opinion: (1) The innocent citizens who died should be given preferential treatment; (2) The loss of the Jindu Theater should be compensated by the government; (3) After investigating the truth of the conflict incident, the culprits should be severely punished. Mayor Wu then stood up to reply as follows: (1) The rumor that the military police conflict was caused by a certain section chief of the Fourth District of the Public Works Bureau watching a play without a ticket, or that three people bought a ticket, or that they bought tickets completely, this matter has not yet been clarified, and it is difficult to clarify its responsibility for the time being. If there is evidence, it will be dealt with according to the law; (2) The loss of the Jindu Theater should be compensated by the responsible party after the truth of the matter is clarified; (3) There is no problem in principle with the matter of condolences, but the detailed methods need to be discussed and decided. The tea party ended at 7:30.</p>

<h3>Many Middle School and Elementary School Students in Northeast China Are Not Familiar with National History and Geography; Some Propose Making and Showing History and Geography Films</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Changchun, 29th] Many middle school and elementary school students in Northeast China are not familiar with their national history and geography, which is quite distressing. Therefore, their level in national history, geography, and national characters is poor, and they all need to start from scratch. Those who are getting older feel especially anxious. During the puppet Manchukuo era, the Japanese strictly controlled thought and did not allow people to say "Chinese." They were only allowed to say "Manchurian," otherwise they would be slapped. The so-called textbooks emphasized Japanese. Even now, many middle school students find it easier to write notes in Japanese than in Chinese. Some people suggest that the Ministry of Education's electrified education should be promoted to the Northeast first, and the rigid textbook content of national history and geography should be compiled into films and screened in elementary and middle schools in the Northeast to make it easier for students to remember, recognize, and understand, and avoid being trapped in a state of distress for a long time.</p>
<h3>Kang Province Temple Education Plans to Formulate Implementation Guidelines</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper in Ya'an, 29th] The residents of the Kang area in Xikang Province live by both farming and animal husbandry. Herdsmen live by moving with water and grass, and farmers rarely live in collective villages. School education is quite difficult to promote. The provincial government is now specifically formulating implementation guidelines for temple education in response to this special situation. The main points are as follows: (1) Implementing agencies: The counties in the border areas will all organize border education work groups; (2) Scope of implementation: Large and small Lama temples and the farmers and herdsmen attached to the temples in the county jurisdiction; (3) Implementation time: Around the assembly period of each Lama temple, each period is three to five weeks, and one period will be temporarily held each year; (4) Implementation work: Pictures, character cards, popular lectures, interpretation of laws and regulations, knowledge of animal husbandry conservation, picture interpretations, exhibitions of local products and handicrafts, classics, Buddhist instruments, etc., lectures on common sense of family hygiene, equestrian sports, local folk song and dance teams, etc.</p>
<h3>Peking University Professors Suggest: Professors in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin Should Not Be Treated Differently</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Beiping, 29th] Peking University professors Zhao Naibo, Yang Renchan, Zheng Huachi, Fan _, and Zhang Jingyue recently jointly wrote to President Hu Shi, asking him to request the government to improve their treatment. Suggestions include: (1) Distribute rice and flour in kind according to the examples of Beijing and Shanghai, or issue subsidies monthly according to the grain prices in Pingjin; (2) Considering the special needs of Pingjin, distribute coal for winter use, and the methods for distributing valuable items in Beijing and Shanghai should be extended to other regions, and Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin should not be treated differently.</p>
<h3>National Textbooks Still Contain Many Materials from the Anti-Japanese War</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Fang Zhimou, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education, praised the national textbooks extensively, saying that their new and perfect content after revision is their characteristic. I recently asked an educator about this matter. According to him, the national textbooks are publications from the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War. Even if they have been revised by the Ministry of Education, it is difficult to expect them to be new and perfect. For example, the 1946 version of the Seventh Series does not have the words "atomic bomb." The 1947 version included a section on "atomic bombs," but it always feels incomplete. There are still many textbooks that stimulate the emotions of the Anti-Japanese War that have not been deleted, such as "Resist! Resist!..." "Charge, charge, charge, charge to the Yalu River and kill all the enemies!" and other motivational textbooks still exist. A new China, which is named as one of the five major powers and advocates world peace, is still using this old wartime textbook. Whether it is appropriate should be given serious attention by the wise Minister Zhu.</p>

<h3>Selection of New President of Jiaotong University: It Is Said That the Authorities Will Choose from Three People, and It Is Said That the Minister of Transportation Will Concurrently Manage It</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] According to news from Jiaotong University, the authorities are considering choosing the new president of the university from Mao Yisheng, Gu Yuxiu, and Ye Gongchao.

<h3>The Importance of Kindergarten</h3>
<p>— By Daniel Stone</p>
<p>During this war, the British Ministry of Health, in order to encourage married women to go out to work, created a kind of day nursery. As long as a small fee is paid, mothers can entrust their children to the nursery to take care of them, and they can work with peace of mind. Most of the children in the nursery have become strong, healthy, and independent little guys. However, the purpose of the nursery at that time was only to take care of children, and no kindergarten education was given.</p>
<p>These day nurseries have been transferred from the Ministry of Health to the local education committee, and now they must decide whether to close these nurseries, continue to operate them as they are, or turn them into kindergartens.</p>
<p>Kindergarten education is designed for children from four to five years old. Many experts believe that this period of education should actually be from two to seven years old and should not be interrupted at the age of five.</p>
<p>I have visited a well-run kindergarten. I had a very pleasant experience. I found that boys especially like to make snacks, and girls, when they are not bathing dolls, especially like to do manual work.</p>
<p>A four-year-old child, sitting at the head of the dining table, seems to have a sense of responsibility for commanding everything.</p>
<p>I think kindergartens are beneficial to all children for the following reasons: First, it does not eliminate the influence of mothers and families on children, but instead gives a child with a harmonious family life a sense of security and believes that they have the ability to get along with others in harmony; Second, most families cannot provide children with everything they need, such as dolls, household appliances, building blocks, tools, painting materials, chalk, lime, dough, small plantations, sand and water, and safe open-air playgrounds, etc., but schools have everything. In addition, kindergarten houses are well-ventilated and sunny. The school also strives to focus on educating individuals on cleanliness. Everyone has their own towels, soap, toothbrushes, and combs, and most of the games are held outdoors.</p>
<p>At the same time, the school also has nurses and doctors who pay attention to the initial symptoms of any disease in each child at all times. Most schools also offer diphtheria and pertussis vaccinations.</p>
<p>Most importantly, with kindergartens, mothers can go out to work. In short, this kindergarten has many benefits and no drawbacks. (British Embassy)</p>

<h3>Guo Zhen Cup Women's Volleyball Tournament: Youlian Friendship Team Wins, Huayan and Jiguang Win in Men's Division</h3>

The matches started at 5:00 PM. The results were: (1) Men's Second Division: Huayan B defeated Gubei in straight sets. Huayan's players were well-rounded and coordinated well, scoring 20 points. However, the second set was close, and the outcome was only decided when the score reached 21-18. Referee: Feng Bingxin. (2) Men's First Division: Jiguang defeated Qianghua with a score of 3-0. Jiguang's Liu Zhaoli, Ling Jidi, Xu Zhengyi, and others served like cannonballs, making it difficult for the opponents to return the ball. The second set was a hard-fought battle, ending with a score of 23-21. In the final set, Jiguang gained momentum and won easily. Commended by student Guan Dahuang. Referee: Liu Hesheng. (3) Women's Division: Youlian defeated Fuhua 2-0. Referee: Gong Tiyin. The disparity in strength was significant, leading to a one-sided match. Youlian's performance was impressive. (4) Friendship Team defeated Municipal No. 1. Referee: Hu Zongfan. The Friendship Team was strengthened by the participation of Dong Xun, a star player from the Nanjing Xiang basketball team, making their strength even greater. In the first set, Municipal No. 1 almost made a comeback, but the Friendship Team narrowly won 21-19. In the second set, the score was 21-14. The Friendship Team has abundant talent and is essentially the Shanghai Women's Basketball League champion, the Green Team, in disguise. The results of yesterday's matches are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Huayan defeated Gubei (Men's Second Division) 21-9, 21-18, 21-12.</p>
<p>(2) Jiguang defeated Qianghua (Men's First Division) 21-14, 23-21, 21-9.</p>

<h3>Qunsheng's Second Battle in Hong Kong: Decisive Victory Over Hong Kong Allied Forces</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter in Hong Kong] The Philippine Qunsheng Basketball Team, in their second battle in Hong Kong, played against the Hong Kong Allied Forces at the China Youth Gymnasium on the 24th. Riding on their victory over Nanhua, Qunsheng also decisively defeated the Hong Kong Allied Forces with a score of 54 to 30.</p>
<p>This match was originally scheduled to take place at the Jialishan Nanhua Court, but "Heaven" did not cooperate, forcing the change to the smaller China Youth Court. In the first quarter, Qunsheng was unable to fully display their strengths and was initially defeated by the Hong Kong Allied Forces with a score of 8-6.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Allied Forces Take the Lead</p>
<p>At the start of the game, Qunsheng fielded Li Shiqiao, Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, Chen Jinde, and Yang Renhui, while the Hong Kong Allied Forces countered with Zhan Shejiang, Lu Zhenxuan, Zhang Shutang, Lu Dezhang, and Shi Zhenda. After the initial contact, Zhang Shutang twice sneaked under the basket, giving the Hong Kong Allied Forces a 4-0 lead. After Wenzhang scored to make it 4-2, Zhenxuan, Renhui, Zhenda, and Wenzhang each scored one basket, and the Hong Kong Allied Forces won the first quarter with a score of 8-6.</p>
<p>Qunsheng Turns the Tables</p>
<p>Second quarter: Qunsheng substituted Jin Dian for Shiqiao, and Renhui tied the score at eight. After Lu Zhenxuan failed to steal a basket, the Hong Kong Allied Forces faced a reversal. By halftime, Qunsheng had turned defeat into victory, taking the lead with a score of 18-12.</p>
<p>Keep Up the Momentum</p>
<p>In the third quarter, Gao Jiahe replaced Zhan Shejiang for the Hong Kong Allied Forces, while Jinde and Renhui were substituted out for Shiqiao and Lian Ke for the visiting team. The visiting team showcased a variety of fancy plays. After Wenhua made a layup and Shiqiao scored on a breakaway, the score increased rapidly. The Hong Kong Allied Forces only managed to regain seven points (Zhang Shutang accounting for six points), ending the quarter with a score of 31-20.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Allied Forces Suffers a Crushing Defeat</p>
<p>In the final quarter, the Hong Kong Allied Forces were able to maintain the situation with long-range shots for the first four minutes. After that, they were at the mercy of Qunsheng and unable to resist, ending the game with a score of 54-30.</p>
<p>The Qunsheng team is scheduled to leave Hong Kong and return to China on the 26th. As most of the team members need to continue their studies and cannot take long leaves of absence, and also due to travel expenses, the trip to Shanghai is unlikely to materialize.</p>
<p>On the 25th, there is still one match against Nanhua at Jialishan. However, the Qunsheng team has stated that they will not play at the China Youth Court. If it rains, the match will be canceled.</p>
<h3>Swimming Across the Irish Sea: A British Swimmer's Feat</h3>
<p>The First Person in History</p>
<p>[United Press, Patrick, Scotland, 28th] British long-distance swimming star, 33-year-old Mr. Blue, set off from Northern Ireland on the evening of the 27th to swim across the 25-mile-long Irish Sea. Through dense fog, schools of jellyfish, and strong currents, he bravely advanced for 16 hours and 15 minutes, reaching here at 2:09 PM (British Standard Time) on the 28th, becoming the first person in history to swim across this strait. Mr. Blue is still full of energy and plans to swim back to Northern Ireland. The Irish Sea has very strong and icy currents that can chill one to the bone, making this feat more difficult than swimming across the 22-mile-long Strait of Dover.</p>
<h3>French Boy Scouts Relay Swim Across the English Channel</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Dover, England, 28th] Thirty-two French boy scouts swam across the English Channel using a relay method, arriving here tonight.

One boy scout remained in the water at all times. They started from Cape Gris-Nez on the French coast, where the seawater was very cold. Everyone applied oil to their bodies to protect themselves from the cold. The French Sea Scouts patrolled alongside the swimmers in boats. Upon reaching the English coast, they were taken into the harbor by a submarine chaser. The French boy scouts came here to invite British boy scouts to participate in the International Boy Scout Jamboree to be held in Paris next month.</p>
<h3>Table Tennis Finals: A Grueling Battle in the Summer Heat, Shanghai Stars Win Against Lianxing, Saving a Glimmer of Hope</h3>
<p>The 26th act of the second Table Tennis Finals took place at 8:00 PM the night before last at the Central Auditorium in 99-degree heat. Despite the summer heat, over 700 spectators came to watch. Chen Jimao, Li Longbiao, and Shen Baihong served as referees. Shanghai Stars were the champions of the previous season. In this season, due to the lack of spirit among a few players and their lax performance, they lost to Post Grade A. The outcome of this match was particularly important. Encouraged by their team leader Qu Yaokang, who had just returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, Shanghai Stars went all out with the determination to win and regain their reputation. Lianxing were originally defeated by Shanghai Stars in the past. However, the young players were full of vigor, winning all five matches in the finals, showing great potential. This reunion with their former rivals was a battle for revenge, so both sides fought fiercely, with rapid back-and-forth play that was breathtaking. Yu Cheng of Shanghai Stars defeated Fan Liangji of Lianxing, tying the score at three each. The final match was even more intense. Li Zongpei of Shanghai Stars played despite being ill, facing the young player Jiang Baiquan of Lianxing. Many worried about Li. However, Zongpei was particularly determined, combining defense and attack with ingenuity. Baiquan was too focused on defense and was ineffective. In the end, Li Zongpei overcame the odds, defeating Jiang Baiquan 3-2. The entire team defeated Lianxing 4-3, turning the tide for Shanghai Stars and maintaining a glimmer of hope for winning the championship. His contribution was truly great. The match results are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Shanghai Stars) (Lianxing) (Score)</p>
<p>Fu Qifang Chen Xingquan 3-1</p>
<p>Huang Zhijun Hu Yiping 1-3</p>

<p>Qianghua vs. Yongsha White (Women's B Division) 6:15 PM</p>
<h3>Chenglie Physical Education College Plans to Reopen</h3>
<p>Chenglie Physical Education College in Suzhou was founded for twenty years. Its graduates have served in various regions and enjoyed a high reputation. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by war in the autumn of 1937. The school's president, Chen Dangshi, led the faculty and students to Sichuan. After the victory, alumni in Suzhou, Shanghai, and other regions, considering the school's long history and its founding to commemorate revolutionary martyrs, strongly urged an early restoration. They repeatedly sent telegrams to Mr. Chen, asking him to return east and plan. It is now heard that Mr. Chen arrived in Shanghai yesterday and will soon plan the reopening of the school. A temporary liaison office has been set up at Zhang Jufei's office at the Municipal Gezhi Middle School on Guangxi Road to connect with all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Unexpected Upset in the Banking and Finance Table Tennis Tournament: Zhejiang Xing Defeats Central</h3>
<p>The first act of the Six Strong Finals of the inaugural Banking and Finance Cup Table Tennis Tournament was held at the China Table Tennis Hall at 7:00 PM the day before yesterday. Central, the champion of the Banking Group, played against Zhejiang Xing, the runner-up of the Finance Group. The referee was Jiang Xiaoshi. Central had a strong team this year and was considered a strong contender for the championship. It was expected that they would easily win this match against Zhejiang Xing. However, the five generals of Zhejiang Xing were exceptionally brave and fiercely resisted, causing Central to struggle and ultimately be defeated. Xu Chuanming of Central scored five points alone and was truly an outstanding talent. However, the captain Yu Shouren performed poorly, losing all five matches, which was a fatal blow to Central. Xie Pancai, Chen Honggao, and Wei Kejun of Zhejiang Xing performed the best. In the end, Zhejiang Xing defeated Central 13-11. An unexpected upset occurred in the first Banking and Finance Cup Table Tennis Tournament. The match results are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Review Committee Visit Director Shen to Discuss the Allocation of Industrial Quotas</h3>
<p>Serious Consequences May Result if Industry and Commerce Cannot Reach an Agreement</p>
<p>[Our Special Report] Representatives Pan Shihao, Tian Heqing, Wu Jichun, and others from the Review Committee for the Allocation of Quota Industrial Raw Materials visited Director Shen Zouting of the Quota Allocation Office of the Import and Export Association yesterday. Previously, the Review Committee had convened various trade associations to discuss the allocation of items such as zinc and various metals and had submitted a report for record. The Allocation Office initially expressed difficulty because the entire agreement on metals was not included. However, after the representatives strongly argued, they agreed to give importance to the percentages stipulated in the agreement. Regarding the allocation of other industrial raw materials, both parties exchanged views. The Review Committee expressed concern about the lack of smooth cooperation among commercial associations and the additional obstacles created by importers. They informed Director Shen that the Review Committee was seeking agreements while the Allocation Office was simultaneously accepting application forms, making it difficult to achieve satisfactory results. They requested that Director Shen establish effective measures to correct the bias. However, Director Shen, considering the vital interests of industry and commerce, urged them to do their best. After the representatives left, they issued a notice scheduling meetings for the Review Committee and representatives of industrial associations on the following two days to report on the progress and discuss the way forward. According to one representative, the Allocation Office stated that seven-tenths of the first quarter's quotas have already been allocated, and the industry wants to know the truth about the allocation. The Allocation Office revealed that representatives from the Paint Commercial Association visited Director Shen Zouting the day before yesterday, hoping to allocate quotas based on their import performance over the years. Director Shen did not express an opinion and only told them to negotiate with the industry. He solemnly stated that serious consequences may result if industry and commerce ultimately cannot reach an agreement.</p>
<h3>The Bullish Side Replenishes on Low Prices, Chinese Stocks Turn from Weak to Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, speculative forces in Chinese stocks were still limited to Yongsha, followed by Meyer. The process was buoyed by the bullish side replenishing their positions, turning from weak to good. Yonglu's trading was active. Northern traders and various active groups in the securities market became excited about the various speculations on exchange rates and the currency system, and buying interest suddenly increased, gradually advancing after hitting lows. Guangbang No. 218 repeatedly sold aggressively, in large quantities. There was no shortage of buyers after the high prices, resulting in a constant tug-of-war. Small stocks such as New Light, Jingfu, and Huafeng also followed Shuisha in their advances and retreats, gradually stabilizing. All stocks, whether hot or cold, ended the day with more gains than losses. Although the future looks promising, there may still be much fluctuation.</p>
<p>At the start, the report that the reopening of trade with Japan had been postponed had a bullish effect. However, the exchange rate difference with the National Bank before the holiday was significant, and the news that banks and financial institutions would stop using same-day checks from next month made the industry feel pressured. Except for Dishuisha, which was highly speculative and opened low at 228 yuan, other stocks were relatively stable. After Dishuisha opened, Nos. 31, 152, 35, 95, 156, and 224 all sold, falling to 223 yuan. At 9:20 AM, Nos. 223, 117, 112, 127, 203, 173, 32, and 180 all entered, rising back to 234 yuan. Nos. 1511, 185, and 231 were still selling at 234 yuan, falling again to 223 yuan. At this time, Xinyi broke through the 3,000 yuan mark, and Meyer fell to 420 yuan. The various small stocks, such as New Light, Jingfu, and Huafeng, all fell to low prices, appearing very weak. Nos. 104 and 223 took advantage of the low prices to enter at 230 yuan.</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM, due to the small amount of supply from Nos. 129 and 95, the stock was still struggling around 225 yuan. When Meyer showed signs of bullishness, major players such as Nos. 157, 186, 14, and 61 became very aggressive buyers. Di Meyer gradually recovered, soon rising by more than 30 yuan, which slightly boosted confidence. Nos. 54, 4, 173, 112, and 180 became stronger buyers, and Di Yongsha rose back to 236 yuan. After 11:00 AM, Nos. 89 and 223 took profits at high prices, retreating to around 230 yuan. No. 224 covered their short positions, and both spot and forward contracts were being absorbed. Nos. 160, 112, 24, and 224, as well as the Northern gang No. 94, bought aggressively, and Di Yongsha rose to 244 yuan. Small stocks such as New Light and Huafeng also began to recover, while Jingfu had less elasticity. Guangbang Nos. 128 and 154 aggressively sold at high prices, retreating to 238 yuan. Nos. 142, 219, 224, 223, and 157 aggressively bought, and No. 224 also bought spot Yongsha aggressively, with more bullish rumors, finally pushing the price up to 247 yuan. Guangbang Nos. 218, 162, 172, and 3 jointly sold aggressively, and No. 186 also sold. After 12:00 PM, the price once fell back to 238 yuan. Nos. 223, 2244, 152, and 69 still had strong buying interest, and the Jiemian gang also raised prices, rising to 246 yuan. Guangbang No. 218 and the banking gang No. 8 continued to sell, and both spot and forward Yongsha ended at a price of 241 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing bid was stable. As a result, Yongsha, Xinyi, and Yonggongzhong were up about half a percent from the previous close, Meyer and Huafeng were slightly up, and New Light and Xinhua were flat. Jingfu and Qinxing were slightly down, while Commerce, China Silk, Datong, Match, Underwear, and National Goods were all flat. China Textile, Cement, Tongyi, and Jinglun were slightly up, Lilian was slightly down, and Wuhe was down half a percent. Di Jiaogugu accounted for small increases in Huafeng, Meyer, and Xinyi, New Light was still flat, Jingfu was slightly down, Yongsha and Yonggong each rose less than half a percent, and most of the old stocks outside the market rose slightly.</p>
<h3>The Stock Exchange Holds a Standing Committee Meeting; Trading Hours Are Changed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The 22nd regular meeting of the Standing Committee of the Stock Exchange was held yesterday afternoon, starting at 4:00 PM in the Stock Exchange conference room. All members of the Standing Committee attended, except for Mr. Wang Zhixin, who was absent due to a trip to Taiwan. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Du __ and adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>At yesterday's meeting, in addition to the routine business report, two proposals were discussed: (1) Due to the hot weather, the market trading hours will be changed starting this Thursday to be from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. (2) Nine members of the Scholarship Management Committee were appointed. In addition to the seven members of the Standing Committee as ex officio members, Yang Yinyu and Gu Shanchang were added as members. The detailed rules for the scholarship will be drafted by Yang Yinxun and then announced.</p>
<h3>Unified Bonds Fall, Foreign Stocks Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Government bonds saw weakness during the middle of yesterday, but were picked up by the Chaozhou gang and Room 360. Although Room 5511 supplied, it was still easy to pull the prices up after they fell. Unified C opened at 8,800 yuan, with a low of 8,200 yuan, and finally hovered around the initial price in the morning, with a turnover of about 3 million yuan. As a result, Unified A, B, C, and E were down 100 yuan from the previous close, and Unified D was down 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks also showed signs of rebounding from lows yesterday. Ewo Silk opened at 77,500 yuan, with a high of 84,800 yuan, before falling back slightly at the close. Securities firms and foreign firms were buyers, while Qing gang and textile firms sold. As a result, Paper, Ewo Silk, and Telephone were up about half a percent from the previous close, while Ewo, Jardine, Arts &amp; Crafts, and Shipping were slightly up. Rongguang and British Allied were both</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cloth Remain Weak</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn and cloth prices have been hovering without strength recently. Prices in each market are tight on the surface but loose underneath. While the decline is outwardly attributed to the wait-and-see attitude of buyers and sluggish sales in rural areas, the real reason is that speculators have run out of tricks and hoarders have changed their business, resulting in no large-scale clearing. It is understood that the stock of cotton yarn and cloth stored in this city is considerable and sufficient for long-term needs. The market conditions for yesterday are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Cotton cloth trading was flat, and the market situation remained stagnant. The reason is that rural buyers are minimal during the busy farming season, and commercial buyers are also mostly cautious and purchase very little. In addition, the authorities have strengthened controls, which dampened confidence, so weavers are turning to other activities. Price fluctuations were limited. Longtou Fine Cloth saw a slight increase compared to the previous day, while other gray cloth and other fabrics showed little change. Native cloth also presented a stable situation. Fangjian opened for sale as usual yesterday (29th). The listed price for Wufu Fine Cloth was 390,000 yuan, and Jinlian Miaowu jacquard was sold at 493,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The demand for cotton yarn was scattered, and most transactions were small. The market rose after being firm, with a fluctuation between ten and twenty thousand yuan. 20-count spun yarn from Shuangma opened at 3 million yuan. Then, the price fell all the way, closing at 1.09 million yuan, down 200,000 yuan from the previous day. 42-count Water Moon was down 200,000 yuan, Blue Phoenix was down 100,000 yuan, and the rest were down from 50,000 to 200,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japan's Cocoon Surplus: 1 Million Pounds to be Sold to China at Reduced Prices, Requiring Approximately US$1.8 Million</h3>
<p>According to the information received by the Third District Silk Reeling Association, the Silk Guidance Association recently received a telegram from the Allied Headquarters stating that 1 million pounds of Japanese cocoons will be sold to China at a price of US$1.80 per pound, which is more than one-third lower than the price of US$2.80 per pound last year. According to this calculation, a total of US$1.8 million is required, which can produce 2,250 dan of raw silk. If raw silk is sold at US$4 per pound, it can generate US$1.33 million. If foreign exchange is used to buy American silk, at a price of US$0.90 per pound, more than 1.47 million pounds of American silk can be purchased. Currently, the import quota for American silk in the country's silk weaving industry is originally set at US$565,000 per quarter, which is far from enough to meet the huge demand. If this batch of raw silk is exchanged for American silk, it can reach more than 1.47 million pounds. Based on the domestic selling price of 20 million yuan per box (200 pounds) of American silk, 140 billion yuan in legal tender can be obtained. Recovering 140 billion yuan of currency with US$1.8 million in foreign exchange is still a complete calculation. The association is currently calculating and requesting the authorities to jointly operate this silk reeling business with the government and businesses.</p>
<h3>14,000 Cases of Keemun Tea: Negotiated Purchase by Chinese and Foreign Tea Merchants; Temporary Suspension of Frozen Egg Exports</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee passed two cases on the morning of the 29th after exchanging views, presided over by Vice Chairman Chen: (1) The China Trust Bureau will be responsible for purchasing part of the expired Keemun tea mortgaged by tea merchants from Chinese and foreign tea merchants. (2) Due to various factors, the purchase of frozen eggs is temporarily suspended. Regarding the first item, the tea in question is the unsold tea from last year that was assisted by the Four Banks Joint Office to mortgage to the China Farmers Bank, which expired this month. Although the principle of purchasing all 14,000 cases of Keemun tea by the British firm Jardine Matheson is acceptable, the committee believes that it is inappropriate for foreign merchants to purchase the entire lot, and the price of only one shilling and two and a half pence per pound seems too low. To adopt a compromise solution, the committee authorized the China Trust Bureau to convene both Chinese and foreign tea merchants to negotiate the purchase. Regarding the second item, the Committee had previously entrusted China to</p>
<h3>Stagnant Rice Digestion Persists; Market Prices Show Slight Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total rice arrival in both the northern and southern markets amounted to over 5,400 shi (石). Retail sales at stores showed some movement. In the southern market, early and late indica rice continued to rise by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, while white rice increased by another 10,000 yuan. The northern market saw an increase of 10,000 yuan as well, but consumption remained weak. It is reported that Hunan has already begun operations. As Hunan is the most abundant rice-producing region, a large quantity is bound to flow eastward. At this time of transition between old and new crops, the rice situation is undergoing many changes and is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Wheat flour sales to the inland north market have strengthened, with improved consumption. Shanghai followed suit to maintain prices, increasing by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Wheat bran also followed the rise of other commodities, rebounding by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean cakes remained unchanged in Shantou, with subdued acceptance from rural villages. The situation is clearly fixed with slow progress. Soybeans saw slight movement among foreign merchants, with oil mills showing acceptable consumption. Local retail sales continued, with favorable market conditions and another increase of 10,000 yuan. Soybeans from Northeast China and the Yangtze River region have arrived. New soybeans from Sichuan have arrived in Shanghai, and the trend looks weak. Red beans saw decent consumption due to the need for making popsicles in the hot weather, resulting in an increase of 10,000 yuan. Broad bean digestion saw slight movement, with local merchants selectively purchasing higher quality goods. Zhejiang buyers were buying at low prices, resulting in a weak but firm market. Sesame seeds showed stability amidst weakness, while corn softened. Foreign merchants continued to handle raw peanuts, resulting in a surge of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market experienced mixed ups and downs. Crude oil from Ningbo merchants was initially flat but then tightened, resulting in a rise of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil rose by 10,000 yuan, but sesame oil saw an influx of goods from Bengbu, falling by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The postal savings bureau placed an order with the China Frozen Egg Industry Association for 5,000 tons of frozen eggs for overseas sales, totaling 5,000 tons. Shipments have been ongoing, with the eighth shipment reaching 3,250 tons. The initial price was 9,000,000 yuan, but it has now risen to over 22,000,000 yuan, a significant difference from the previous price. Due to weather and other reasons, both parties agreed to cancel the above agreement, and the matter of frozen egg exports has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Tea Sales Remain Strong</h3>
<p>Various domestic teas, amidst the intense summer heat, saw continued sales from local stores and foreign merchants. This resulted in steady business throughout the day, similar to the previous day. The foreign tea market remains quiet, mainly because exporters are busy fulfilling a recent agreement between Jebsen &amp; Jessen and Morocco for 900 tons of Chun Mee green tea. As a result, demand for all types of tea has decreased, and transactions are declining. However, sellers remain optimistic, and the market remains stable.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Retreat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar prices retreated by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan because sugar allocation was suspended this week, and holders were reluctant to hold inventory. The association set prices for No. 20 medium white sugar at 557,000 to 560,000 yuan, Taiwanese red sugar at 540,000 yuan, No. 4.5 white sugar at 637,000 yuan, and local sugar also softened slightly, with few transactions. Shantou Jieyang syrup was 410,000 yuan, cotton red sugar was 450,000 yuan, Xinghua white sugar was 565,000 to 570,000 yuan, Xinghua red sugar was 440,000 yuan (second grade at 410,000 yuan), and Hainan red sugar was 430,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rayon Initially Weak but Later Firm; Factory Yarn Stable with No Change</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market was initially weak but later firmed. No. 120 Gao Shan (高山) and Asahi (旭字) glossy yarns opened at 24,000,000 yuan. As the allocation price was unclear, holders tried to push up prices, leading to a closing bid up 400,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the market remained firm with transactions and continued to rise, eventually closing at 24,700,000 yuan, up 500,000 yuan from the previous day. Tianqiao (天橋) new goods and Toyo (東洋) yarns also rose accordingly.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the factory yarn market was quiet, with stable prices and no changes. High-uniformity grades were quoted at the original price, but there were no transactions. Only a few bundles of medium-grade yarns were traded at 22,800,000 yuan with a five-day premium. Dry spun yarn quotations remained unchanged with very few transactions. No. 28 yarn was quoted between 17,500,000 yuan per bundle.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market declined again. Huaqiang (華強) quilt covers traded at 10,040,000 yuan at the opening. After various attempts to raise prices, they rose from 420,000 yuan to 450,000 yuan, with a selling price of 470,000 to 500,000 yuan, only fluctuating by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Dacheng (大誠) quilt covers were bid at 500,000 yuan, with a selling price of 550,000 yuan. Dacheng check pattern fabrics were ignored, once falling below 4,000 yuan. Intermediate grade traded at 4,040 yuan, with a spot price of 4,400 yuan quoted at the close. Sheng goods were extremely weak. Chongdian (沖電) power-loom cloth was available at 280,000 yuan, and standard grade was also within 300,000 yuan. Hua Gui (華歸) rayon high-end goods traded at 21,500,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Implementation Plan for Textile Adjustment; Private Mills Hope for No Rigid Regulations</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] Leading members of the Six District Cotton Textile Association continued to discuss the revised Textile Adjustment Implementation Plan by the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday. It is reported that the private yarn mills felt that some of the amendments by the Ministry of Finance and Economics were still not entirely satisfactory and needed further revision. They also hoped that these amendments would not be rigidly enforced, as they might contradict reality.</p>
<p>According to a leader of a private yarn mill, the government currently controls 75% of the country's yarn production through cotton quota and cotton managed by the Executive Yuan. They hoped that the government would not purchase the yarn spun by each mill from cotton purchased independently, as they heard that the government would collect half of the yarn spun by each mill from domestically purchased cotton. Regarding the future distribution and pricing of cotton yarn, they believed that both should take into account the actual situation and adopt a flexible system. When market demand is high, the supply should be released as much as possible, and a flexible pricing system should be adopted according to the market. In this way, the market will naturally tend to stabilize. The current negotiated price seems to have lost its flexibility, which should be improved.</p>
<p>[Further News] The Textile Adjustment Committee is scheduled to hold a routine meeting at 4 PM this Friday to discuss the revised Textile Adjustment Implementation Plan provided by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and cotton [illegible]. According to a spokesperson for the committee, the first phase of the Textile Adjustment Committee's pilot program for joint cotton yarn distribution involved 20,000 bales, with only about 2,000 bales remaining. Once the distribution is completed, the Textile Adjustment Committee will use the cotton yarn purchased by the Executive Yuan to continue the distribution. It is reported that factories have already submitted more than 20,000 bales, so the distribution of cotton yarn will definitely not be interrupted.</p>
<h3>Discount and Loan Committee Meeting; 26 Loan Applications Approved</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] The 18th routine meeting of the Central Bank Discount and Loan Committee was held in the conference room of the committee at 3 PM yesterday. Over ten committee members attended, including Qin Runqing, Wu Kexiang, and Pan [illegible] Heng. A total of 26 loan applications were approved, amounting to 5.9 billion yuan.</p>
<h3>Central Trust of China to Launch Group Profit-Sharing Savings Deposits Next Month</h3>
<p>Profit-Sharing Lottery on September 1st</p>
<p>Group Profit-Sharing Savings Deposits, designated by the Executive Yuan to be handled by the Central Savings Association under the Central Trust of China (CTC), were recently learned that the CTC has already received the order from the Ministry of Finance. The savings department of the CTC is preparing all implementation matters and plans to officially launch on August 11th, with the profit-sharing lottery on September 1st. These deposits are divided into two types, A and B. For each type, the CTC will issue unregistered fixed-term deposit certificates to the group at the time of deposit, allowing them to withdraw principal and interest. These deposits offer particularly generous profits, with both interest and profit sharing. Profit sharing is distributed monthly, determined by lottery. During the lottery, depositors will send representatives to participate, and representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the Four Joint Offices will be invited to attend.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Sales</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] China Textile Construction Corporation sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 12,880 [units]. There were 397 applications, including 15 manufacturers and 382 cloth merchants.</p>
<h3>Lively Exports of Yarn and Cloth; Prices Not Favorable</h3>
<p>[Our Reporter] According to Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of China Textile Construction Corporation, the trend of the company acting as an agent for the government to export yarn and cloth has gradually become lively, but prices have not been favorable. For 20-count yarn, the average price in Southeast Asia is about US$270-280 per piece. The price in Rome is better, at nearly US$300 per piece.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Export Design Meeting</h3>
<p>First Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>[Our Reporter] The Design Committee of the Silk Production and Marketing Coordination Committee was formally established yesterday afternoon at 4 PM and held its first meeting at the Central Bank. Many people attended, including Liu Gongyun, Chu Fucheng, Tang Xixiang, Xue Zukang, and Wang Zishuang, with Chairman Liu Gongyun presiding. Liu delivered an opening speech, followed by Tan Xihong explaining the significance of the Design Committee's establishment. Finally, Chu Fucheng gave a speech as a guest, hoping that the establishment of the Design Committee would assist in the export of raw silk. The meeting then discussed the following proposals: (1) Passed the nine articles of the Design Committee's organizational charter. (2) Regarding the raw silk export plan, it was resolved to invite Chang Maiwanjing, Cai Xintao, Wu Shengbo, Ma Ke, and Xue Zukang to draft the plan. The five standing committee members are scheduled to meet at 3 PM today to discuss the plan. (3) The Silk Production and Marketing Coordination Committee submitted four proposals, including the request from silk reeling factories to be issued 20% of the raw silk, and the issue of silk reeling workers. It was resolved to submit them to the Standing Committee for discussion first, and then submit them to the entire committee for discussion after a plan is formulated. The Standing Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting at 4:30 PM this Friday. However, if converted to legal tender at the official exchange rate, the loss will be more than double. Fortunately, the government can use the foreign exchange earned to import other necessary goods, thereby offsetting the losses. It is said that among the various goods recently sold by the company in the south, cotton cloth accounts for the majority, reaching hundreds of thousands of bolts in July.</p>
<h3>Weak Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was flat, with sluggish transactions. Yarn mills, expecting the new cotton crop to arrive soon, were eager to clear their inventories, so demand was weak. As yarn prices have gradually risen, cotton clothing sales have slowed down, making it difficult to raise prices. Customers were eager to sell at high prices, but the weak trend made transactions difficult. Bids for factory delivery were 2.2 million for Lingbao, 2.09 million for Shashi, 2.09 million for Chong Shashi, and 1.725 million for Huo Ji. The transaction price was 2.2 million for Lingbao, 2.1 million for Shandong Tuolisi, and 335,000 for Zhoupu seed cotton.</p>

<h3>Greening Qinghai</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Xu Tang</p>
<p>Qinghai, 21st Air Dispatch</p>
<p>Plant willows across three thousand li,</p>
<p>Bringing the spring breeze through the Yumen Pass. — Zuo Wenxiang</p>
<p>Qinghai is located on the northwest plateau, with a purely continental climate, dry air, and little rainfall. As a result, there are nine harvests out of ten years, and the people suffer from poverty. However, during the summer and autumn, heavy rains sometimes occur, irrigating the mountains. Not only can the water not be contained, but it often turns into mountain floods, destroying crops and drowning people and animals. The losses are immeasurable. In addition, hailstorms occur from time to time, and epidemics are rampant, causing even greater losses to the people. At this time, if afforestation can be promoted early, it will prevent floods on one hand, and the roots of trees entering the soil will also store water, making the ground moist. Even strong winds will not be able to stir up dust. The ground, because of the trees forming forests and the branches supporting each other, can also regulate the climate. As for building embankments along rivers and sandy beaches, it is necessary to have the roots of trees to maintain them, so that the embankments can be strong and not be washed away or sink. Qinghai's construction projects have been advancing rapidly in recent years. The population in various places is increasing day by day. All repairs to highways, bridges, sleepers, and buildings require a large amount of wood to supply needs. Therefore, when the northwest [illegible] defense construction begins, afforestation has become an urgent task for Qinghai's national economy and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Bringing the Spring Breeze Beyond the Border</p>
<p>Qinghai's afforestation work began at the beginning of the establishment of the province, and was promoted in the 27th year. After the reorganization of the provincial government, the Tao Yin Gongshu (道尹公署, provincial magistrate's office) opened a nursery at the Dajiao Chang (大教場, large parade ground) in Xining City in the 16th year of the Republic of China, pioneering the government's afforestation efforts. In the 18th year, when the province was first established, everything was waiting to be done. In that year, the trees planted were only in four counties: Guide, Ledu, Xunhua, and Huangyuan, with a total of 40,765 trees planted. At that time, the trees planted in the northern ancient city of the provincial capital had already grown into timber, which was continuously cut down for public construction needs. The trees cut down were replanted in the open space as needed, and they have all grown into forests to this day. In the 19th year, the provincial government formulated measures for rewarding and punishing tree planting, and ordered all counties to plant trees diligently in order to promote afforestation. Personnel were also dispatched to various counties to inspect and supervise. In that year, a total of 29,211 poplar and elm trees were planted. The number increased year by year. In the 20th and 21st years of the Republic of China, 73,000 poplar and willow trees were planted successively. Among them, Gonghe and Dulan counties planted more than 10,000 white poplars each. This was the beginning of Qinghai's afforestation work penetrating into the Mongolian and Tibetan areas. The spring breeze beyond the border has been widely introduced. The number of trees planted increased by one fold each year, reaching 200,000 trees within three years. By the 26th year, due to the army and civilians' efforts to suppress bandits, afforestation work temporarily declined. However, Xining, Hualong, and other counties also planted more than 110,000 trees. According to statistics, Qinghai planted approximately 450,000 poplar and willow trees within ten years from the 16th year to the 26th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Greening as a Central Task</p>
<p>In the 27th year of the Republic of China, the provincial government was reorganized. Provincial Chairman Ma Bufang believed that afforestation was the foundation of the economy and construction, so he listed afforestation as one of the six central tasks and resolved to realize the ideal of greening Qinghai. Thus, the great movement to expand afforestation began. First, the number of seedlings that could be collected and the manpower that could be hired in each county were carefully calculated, and then the areas were divided and ordered for all county residents to participate. The results were remarkable. In that year, more than 340,000 trees were planted, almost equal to the number planted in the previous ten years. The following year, along the Huangshui River and near Xingcheng, 400,000 trees were planted, again equal to the number planted in the entire province last year. The total number of trees planted in the 28th year increased to 660,000. In the 29th year, more than 400,000 trees were planted. In the 30th year, another 450,000 trees were planted, with Guide County planting the most. In the 31st year, another 1 million willow trees were planted. In the 32nd year, the provincial government promoted expanded afforestation, and with the construction of the Datong Xiangshan Park, the number of trees planted in one year reached more than 3.1 million. In the following year, Huangyuan and other six counties, due to the large-scale construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Gansu-Qinghai Highway, needed a large amount of manpower, so they did not plant more trees. However, the number of trees planted by public and private schools in that year reached more than 520,000. In the 34th year, in addition to planting white poplar and willow trees, pine, cypress, plum, and apricot trees were added, totaling approximately 5.52 million trees. The forest area near Xining City was assisted and protected by the 82nd Division of the National Army.</p>
<p>Achievements of More Than 40 Million Trees</p>
<p>In March of the 35th spring, the National Government commended Qinghai for its outstanding achievements in afforestation over the years. The entire province was grateful and motivated, and the afforestation work this year was further expanded. School afforestation was also launched, and the results were ten times greater than in previous years. Starting this year, the provincial government specially announced three afforestation methods: first, continue to expand the planting of poplar and willow trees to complete the afforestation work; second, plant elm trees to cultivate hardwood; and third, cultivate peach, apricot, and plum trees to increase people's nutrition and increase hardwood materials. It was also stipulated that: 1. All central national schools in Xining City and various counties should build a school forest in a suitable public location nearby, selected by local elders and gentlemen in consultation with the principal, for easy protection; 2. Each student should plant at least 15 trees and at most 100 trees, with the trees collected from the student's baojia (保甲, administrative unit); 3. Students who are too young to plant trees should have their parents plant them on their behalf; 4. Walls should be built or trenches dug around the forests to prevent trampling by cattle and sheep. As a result of these regulations, school afforestation made great progress this year. A total of 960,142 trees were planted by schools at all levels in the twelve counties.</p>
<p>During this period, the tree planting work of civil servants, soldiers, and civilians in various counties and cities also progressed simultaneously. Among them, from the Mo Zhongquan Bay (莫衆泉灣) and Houzi River (后子河) in the Beichuan (北川) of Huangzhong, passing through the Changningbao (長寗堡) and Zhao Jia [illegible] (趙家[illegible]) in Huzhu County, to the [illegible] Mountain ([illegible]山) in Datong, in this meadow spanning three counties, all officers and soldiers of the 8th Cavalry Brigade and students of the training corps jointly planted trees for more than a month. The number of trees planted was considerable, making it the most outstanding area in Qinghai's afforestation achievements over the years. A total of 13,400,613 large and small white poplar trees and seedlings were planted. This forest area was designated as a special zone, named the "Victory Forest Area" (勝利林區) to commemorate the glory of the rear military construction after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and as a memorial to the Anti-Japanese War [illegible] victory for the province's afforestation cause. [Illegible] Huangzhong County planted a total of 110,635 willow trees. Caojiabao Beach in Huzhu County planted a total of 256,832 white poplar trees. Huangyuan County planted a total of 203,585 white poplar trees. Tongren County planted a total of 13,657 white poplar trees. In Yushu County, 1,488 white poplar trees were planted in Batang Canal and Changgu Temple, making it the year with the most planting achievements in Yushu. In that year, a total of 16,378,791 poplar and willow trees were planted in Qinghai Province, creating a new record for afforestation achievements. From the 27th to the 35th year, the total number of seedlings planted in the nine years reached 33,279,320, an average increase of more than 80 times compared to the afforestation work before the 26th year. In the past 20 years, most of the trees planted in Qinghai were poplar and willow, followed by pine and cypress. Tree planting and seedling planting were used, and the cutting planting method was used. The trees planted along the roads were mostly transplanted. The forests were planted at a distance of about one meter apart, forming rows and columns, which was very beautiful. Ditches were built in the forest area for irrigation. Therefore, the trees planted in the forest areas over the years have been sufficiently moisturized and nourished, and the growth of the trees has become more and more prosperous, forming forests. However, the losses due to water damage and breakage are also not small. This situation has gradually decreased. To date, in addition to those used for public and private [illegible] businesses, 80% to 90% of the trees planted remain. In decades, they will all become pillars for the construction of the northwest.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring this year, people, public officials, teachers, and students in various counties have resumed large-scale afforestation. More than 1.28 million seedlings have been collected from the people, and 4,600 laborers have been hired. In addition, the trees are also felled from public forests. In one month, no less than 10 million trees have been planted. At the same time, measures have been formulated to reward private tree planting, and the government will commend those who plant more than 1,000 trees privately. Therefore, there has been a lot of progress in tree planting this year. To date, the total number of trees planted, combined with those planted in the past, has exceeded 40 million.</p>
<p>Tree Planting Has Reached Its Peak</p>
<p>The years of the 35th and 36th in Qinghai can be said to have reached the peak of tree planting. Comparing the achievements of the past 20 years, they have exceeded dozens of times. Therefore, the great achievement of greening Qinghai will be fully realized today. However, when we recall the difficulties of afforestation in the past, it is truly unforgettable. Taking Yushu County as an example, because the area is located in a border area, the customs are undeveloped, the climate is harsh, and the people have no habit of planting trees and do not have enough seedlings. As a result, they had to purchase them from the border of Xikang. This kind of difficulty cannot be compared to any other fact. Therefore, the provincial government specially invented the cultivation of poplar and willow nurseries in order to cultivate trees. The results were very considerable. In addition, they also spent a lot of money and manpower to transplant pine and cypress trees from hundreds of miles away. The cultivation of apricot, elm, peach, and plum trees was also very painstaking. The reason is that these plants were previously only found in areas east of Xining. The people west of Xining were mostly afraid of reform, confined to old habits, and unwilling to plant them. In addition, because they were not familiar with the methods, they could not achieve results, so they went through the motions and planted very little. In order to make the peach, plum, apricot, and elm [illegible] [illegible], the province exchanged wealth and food for seeds and fruit samples, and then distributed them, forcing planting. As a result, the number of elm seeds alone reached 3,934,012 liters. To date, the above trees have all been propagated and grown, and are unusually lush. In decades, in addition to the shade of poplars and willows, Qinghai will be able to see peaches and apricots everywhere, and a colorful and fragrant scene. The use of its hardwood will be a new [illegible] [illegible] for Qinghai's military needs.</p>
<p>The reason why Qinghai's afforestation work has been so rapid is that, in addition to the efforts of the entire province and the annual afforestation, it is also committed to daily forest protection. [Illegible] Currently, each county has forest protection teams in public forests, and their equipment, expenses, and food are [illegible] provided by each government. Therefore, the results of tree planting are easy to show. This is something that can be used as a reference for tree planters across the country.</p>
<p>The slogan of "greening" has now been chanted loudly. In the northwest corner, Qinghai, the trees are already lush green and endless. Now they are persevering in hard work, so the province that will be greened first in the future will probably be Qinghai.</p>
<h3>Public Opinion, Public Hearing: The Third General Assembly of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent Yang Yu</p>
<p>Taipei, 20th (Airmail)</p>
<p>The Taiwan Provincial Assembly - after the February 28th Incident, many people suspected that it had changed its nature. In the past, those who stood in front of the people and shouted loudly became the leading assemblymen who guided the rebellion during the incident. The Third General Assembly of the Provincial Assembly was held again one month and five days after the establishment of the new Provincial Government. Having learned a bloody lesson and welcoming new hope, its significance has become even greater. I dare say that everyone is watching and listening, giving it a new expectation. This expectation is also a test of whether it can truly represent public opinion in the future.</p>
<p>Not Afraid to Say Too Much, Only Afraid Not to Say</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee Member Qiu Niantai was announced by the Provincial Government as the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, but he firmly declined the position. In the opening ceremony of the conference, he was the first to give a speech as a guest. He compared the three meetings and believed that the enthusiasm of the speeches was getting weaker each time. Now that the Provincial Government has been established and Chairman Wei is an enlightened person, he hopes that the assemblymen will regain their spirit. The assemblymen themselves are not afraid to ask Chairman Wei: At present, public morale is low, and there is a difficulty in expressing their opinions freely. Chairman Wei's reply was that the assemblymen are the bridge between the people and the government. Why is public morale low? We should find a reason to seek countermeasures. As for himself, he is not afraid of the assemblymen saying too much, only afraid of not saying anything.</p>
<p>The seats of the assemblymen were initially arranged according to the names of the Second General Assembly, resulting in sparse arrangements, which immediately gave people a sense of steadfastness in adversity. The February 28th Incident was an excessive riot, but also a ruthless melting pot.</p>
<p>Huang Chunbei, who used to be known as the "Hundred-Question Assemblyman," was silent this time and only proposed four motions. On the day of the opening ceremony, he represented the assemblymen in delivering a thank-you speech to Chairman Wei and the heads of agencies and guests. After the pleasantries, he launched into a lengthy discussion, from rice prices to bean cakes, and then from summer cakes to pork. He said, "Farmers cannot afford bean cakes because the price of one bean cake is equal to one catty of rice. Feeding pigs with bean cakes can make one catty of pork sell for 250 yuan." Can one bean cake originally produce one catty of rice? Can one bean cake grow one catty of pork? Many people were dumbfounded by this "thank-you speech."</p>
<p>Two Hundred and Twenty Thousand Children Out of School</p>
<p>Chairman Wei's policy report focused on the economic aspects. He offered three policy measures: regulating materials, stabilizing prices, and providing relief to the unemployed. He requested that prosperity should start with stability, and stability depends on the consolidation of the economic foundation. Regarding the problem of children out of school, he also provided a statistical figure: there are 1,045,000 children of school age in the province, but only 820,000 are in school, accounting for 78.68% of the total. There are 225,000 children out of school, accounting for 21.32% of the total. The education of the next generation has also been devastated by the economic recession.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Chen Yi promised the Taiwanese people that the election of county and city mayors would be implemented from July 1st, as transferred to the Central Government. Minister Bai also issued Bulletin No. 1, stating that Taiwan Province could prepare a proposal for early implementation of popular elections and submit it to the Ministry of the Interior for approval and implementation. The assemblymen asked Chairman Wei to fulfill this promise. Chairman Wei said that he agreed in principle, but had no authority to promise. It was not a matter of willingness but a matter of legislation. He also interpreted the qualification requirement, stating that the appointment of county and city mayors required having served as a Recommended Rank official for more than two years or passing the civil service examination. There were almost no local people who had this qualification. Chairman Wei said very rationally: Now the Provincial Assembly can only make a preparation, which is to study the standard for selecting candidates in the long term and submit the decision to the Central Government for reference.</p>
<p>Currency Reform Date Undetermined</p>
<p>Yan Jiagan, the Director of Finance of the Provincial Government, became the target of criticism from the assemblymen at the Second General Assembly for the 150,000 tons of sugar. Guo Guorui, who earned the title of "Atomic Bomb Assemblyman" for his fiery speech, was in the limelight at that time. This time, perhaps because he had opened a prison, the scene seemed "calm" during the financial report and inquiry. However, what people hoped for was a cold and deliberate suggestion, not a violent and ill-intentioned attack.</p>
<p>The amount of Taiwan currency issued and its possible changes in the future were of concern to the entire assembly. Chief Accountant Pan reported a lengthy number: From July 1937 to May 28th of this year, a total of 8,884,211,093 yuan was issued, of which 3,611,118,331 yuan was collected for old banknotes, and 5,073,112,762 yuan was newly issued. Judging from the fluctuations in commodity prices in this province and the guidance of production loans for economic construction in this province, this number is not too excessive. The adjustment of the exchange rate with the legal tender will depend on the development of commodity prices in Shanghai and this province, seeking flexible changes and applications that can be increased at any time. Although Director Yan did not specify the exact date and amount of the increase, the recent news of a possible exchange rate of one to sixty has been speculated by people. How long will the Taiwan currency be maintained? In the economic reform plan of Executive Yuan President Zhang, it was also mentioned together with the currency systems of Xinjiang and Northeast China, but the timing is unknown.</p>
<p>Public Funding Treatment Is the Best in the Country</p>
<p>The reorganization of the administrative divisions of counties and cities in this province was proposed by Commissioner Lin Xiantang at the Provincial Government meeting. This time, the assemblymen also raised it during the civil affairs inquiry. This overall change involving local conditions, customs, population, transportation, economy, and culture cannot but be carefully considered. Director Zhu also told reporters not long ago that he would base the decision on various data and comparisons.</p>
<p>The call for the employment of talents from the provincial people reflects the distress of the large unemployed group and young people in Taiwan Province. However, Director Zhu stated that a specific plan will be drafted immediately.</p>
<p>Before the opening of the Provincial Assembly, Director of Education Xu inspected the schools at all levels in central and southern Taiwan, so his report contained more practical opinions, such as guidance for the in-service training of national school teachers, summer workshops on teaching agriculture will be held to help teachers learn agricultural knowledge, and national education guidance groups will be organized. Although the number of secondary schools is large, the quality of teachers and school facilities need to be improved urgently. Regarding public funding, students studying in the mainland now receive public funding of 229,500 yuan in legal tender per month, which is the highest in the country. Even within the province, in addition to the Normal College, public-funded and half-public-funded students account for 30% of Taiwan University, the Agricultural College, and the Engineering College. Full public-funded students receive 1,500 Taiwan dollars per month, as well as 70% of the allocated price of white rice.</p>
<p>The police inquiry focused on the issue of police treatment. One assemblyman casually suggested that the police should use gas guns "to avoid shooting at every turn." Director Wang smiled bitterly: "There are no tear gas guns like that in Shanghai now."</p>
<p>Taichung Port Construction Will Be Dealt With Carefully</p>
<p>Yang Jieshou, the Director of Construction, announced three principles for dealing with the issue of opening factories to private management, which is of concern to the people of the province: continuing to start work, openly absorbing idle capital, and relaxing the scope of priority industries. At present, the state-owned shares of match factories, chemical product factories, printing paper industries, and four coal mining companies have been opened to private management. The second step of measures is awaiting research and decision.</p>
<p>The Datian Creek Hydropower Project is of great importance to the revitalization of industry in this province. The entire plan can generate more than 100,000 kilowatts, which is the largest power source in this province. Among them, the Tianleng site can generate 18,000 kilowatts. 70% of the land project has been completed, and the power company has borrowed 200 million yuan from the Bank of Taiwan to prepare for resumption of work. The machinery has been negotiated for purchase in Japan and Canada.</p>
<p>The Japanese completed 60% of Taichung Port after five years of construction. Director of Transportation Chen explained the reasons for stopping construction: the budget is 5 billion Taiwan dollars, and the provincial government does not have this financial capacity; the Japanese built it hastily, and there are irreparable major errors in the plan; this province already has the three major ports of Keelung, Hualien, and Kaohsiung, which are sufficient for throughput, so it will stop.</p>
<p>Progressive Purchase of Surplus Grain from Large Households</p>
<p>After a debate at the Provincial Government meeting, the price of food purchased with taxes and the purchase of surplus grain from large households were sent to the Provincial Assembly for research. This was the highlight of the conference, the finale! Enthusiastic speeches and fierce debates were held because this was a matter of vital interest to six million people. For the purchase of rice with taxes, 12 kilograms of dry rice husks are purchased for each yuan of the regular rice field tax (land rent); large households refer to those who pay more than 1,000 kilograms of rice husks for the annual field tax at one time. Surplus grain refers to the grain collected by large households, excluding the field tax, public grain, and rice purchased with taxes, as well as the household's own consumption for the current period (limited to ten people, with a monthly consumption of 21 kilograms per person). A progressive method is adopted to purchase 40% of the grain from 1,000 to 5,000 kilograms and 60% of the grain from more than 30,000 kilograms. The Grain Association Bureau set the price at 16.5 yuan per Taiwan catty (27.5 yuan per kilogram), which was met with opposition at the meeting. It was believed that the price was too low. The Grain Bureau presented figures stating that the increase in the circulation speed of the currency issuance was insufficient; the treatment of civil servants and teachers could not keep up with commodity prices, which was also insufficient as a basis; although the commodity price index was quite reliable, it was based on the cost of production to encourage production, and each thousand Taiwan catties should be 16,466.20 yuan.</p>
<p>"Low grain prices hurt farmers, high grain prices hurt the people," "Without actually farming, the investigation will not be accurate."... The debate lasted a whole day on the 27th. As a result, someone shouted: "Large landlords should show conscience!" followed by applause.</p>
<p>The price was newly passed! The price is still 16.5 yuan per Taiwan catty, with two sentences attached below: "The government should prevent the reduction of the amount of food and actively encourage increased production due to the implementation of this plan."</p>
<p>Chief of Staff Chen Cheng arrived at Kuanchengzi Airport in Changchun on a special "Chasing Cloud" plane. Chen shook hands with the welcomers with a smile. One of the welcomers was General Pan Yukun, the commander of the New First Army. (Our correspondent Zhao Qingshu from Changchun)</p>
<h3>Escaping the Summer Heat in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng</p>
<p>July 26th</p>
<p>This summer, the Meteorological Observatory reported: "The tropical air current covering the entire country and the nine eastern provinces and the Pacific air mass in Japan, Ryukyu, and Taiwan are in contact in the Sea of Korea." No wonder the climate across the country is much hotter than in 1946. Hangzhou's West Lake is surrounded by mountains on three sides and a bustling city on one side. In summer, the sun shines down fiercely, absorbed by the trees and grass on the mountains and accepted by the water in the lake. After absorption and acceptance, it evaporates, so the heat waves are constantly surging. Some people say: "Hangzhou is very close to the ocean. If there is a sea breeze in summer, there would even be a unique coastal climate like Qingdao." But Hangzhou does not have these favorable conditions.</p>
<p>West Lake Is Like a Pot of Water</p>
<p>Some people say that West Lake is like a pot of water. She is surrounded by mountains, and the sun is like fire, constantly boiling it. This pot of boiling water cannot release steam, only the people of Hangzhou are suffering. Really, in the recent days of heat waves, the summer nights of West Lake are only cool after eleven o'clock in the early morning. At other times, the temperature is above 90 degrees. Otherwise, if you row a boat in the lake, it is like rolling in boiling water.</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, although it is also one of the cities that accepts civilization and enjoys it most quickly, it is not as much as Shanghai. The large hotels, restaurants, and theaters in Shanghai have air-conditioning equipment, and even many wealthy and well-off people have air-conditioning in their homes to regulate the temperature. No matter how much it costs to cool down in a day, there are still many people enjoying it. But Hangzhou does not have this blessing.</p>
<p>The Movie Theater Is Hotter Than a Furnace</p>
<p>One movie theater has more than twenty electric fans, which is actually advertised, but the electric fans in various entertainment venues cannot be turned on frequently, so they can only be turned on and off from time to time. Like the movie theater, the fans are only turned on after the movie starts. Therefore, entering the movie theater is like entering a furnace. Men take off their clothes, and women unbutton their cheongsams. There is also a famous Hangzhou restaurant, Tianxianglou, which is promoted as having air conditioning, but when you enter this restaurant, there are only a few electric fans. In the past, Hangzhou had electric fans for rent, but now they are gone. An ordinary oscillating electric fan sells for more than two million yuan. I asked a hardware store, and the owner said: "There are not enough electric fans to sell, who still rents them? The factories that produce electric fans have stopped working this year, so the price of electric fans is so high."</p>
<p>Various Ways to Cool Down</p>
<p>Hangzhou's ways to escape the summer heat cannot be compared with Shanghai in terms of enjoyment. Therefore, this year, wealthy people in Hangzhou have gone to Shanghai to escape the summer heat. It is said that Mogan Mountain is also extremely hot, and several foreign friends have run down from the mountain. A Hangzhou friend in his sixties said to me: "This kind of weather is really unbearable. Not to mention outsiders, even the people of Hangzhou cannot stand it." However, as a local Hangzhou person, he still has ways to escape the summer heat, such as going to the tree-lined buildings in Lingyin Temple, the top of Yuhuang Mountain, or the Yanhua Cave and Ziyun Cave to cool down. Some go to Chenghuang Mountain to enjoy the breeze, or drink tea at Pinghu Qiuyue. These days, the tea seats on Chenghuang Mountain are crowded. One side faces the Qiantang River, and the other side leans against West Lake. The cool breeze is a very good place. Pinghu Qiuyue relies entirely on the wind blowing from the lake. People in the bustling city regard the quiet places around Hubin and Lihu as summer resorts. In fact, in my opinion, Hangzhou must have cool places, but they have not been arranged into an environment where one can escape the summer heat. For example, at Chenghuang Mountain, Lingyin, and Yanhua Cave, a few houses can be built to live in, and naturally one will forget the torment of the summer heat. However, most of the people are still immersed in the heat wave and cannot get rid of this heat attack, which is naturally in vain.</p>
<p>From the First Fu to the Third Fu</p>
<p>The weather in the hot sixth month of the lunar calendar is divided into the first fu, second fu, and third fu, according to Chinese custom. After the three fu days are over, it means that autumn is coming. The people of Hangzhou, of course, only wear extremely thin clothes to deal with these "three fu" days. Ordinary families have silk trousers and silk shirts. If the residence is too stuffy, it can be moved to the street to sleep. Special attention is also paid to eating. Wealthy families often have "ham in the first fu, chicken in the second fu, and gold and silver hooves in the third fu." Ordinary and poor families have "amaranth in the first fu, eggplant in the second fu, and winter melon with the skin on in the third fu." Researching why they eat like this, some say that wealthy families have something to eat, and poor families have nothing to eat. Wealthy families think of ways to eat, so poor families also think of ways to eat to counter them. In fact, in this hot summer, ham, chicken, and gold and silver hooves are not very greasy and are very refreshing. Amaranth, eggplant, and winter melon with the skin on can all relieve the summer heat.</p>
<p>When the people of Hangzhou feel uncomfortable in the summer heat, the first step is usually to scrape sha, that is, to scrape the neck and arms with their fingers until they turn red. The second step is to drink ten drops of water, and then send them to the hospital. However, some wealthy families buy a lot of honeysuckle dew and other things from Hu Qing Yu Tang in the summer to relieve the summer heat. Recently, watermelons have been on the market, and 600 yuan can buy a catty, but real Haining watermelons are not easy to find.</p>
<p>Lingyin Sutra Lecture</p>
<p>The Lingyin Temple specially launched a sutra lecture, inviting Abbot Chishong of Jing'an Temple in Shanghai to be the main speaker. On the day of the lecture, I made a special trip to listen. He lectured on the Prajna Paramita Sutra on Benevolent Kings Protecting the Country. He began by saying: "In such hot weather, everyone has 'troublesome heat', but the hot weather is easy to pass, and the troublesome heat in the heart is not easy to disappear for a while." Then he talked about the principles of benevolent kings protecting the country, hoping that everyone can protect the country with a benevolent heart, so that disasters can be eliminated and troubles can be thrown away. There were many people who went to listen at that time, and Mr. Ma Yifu, the president of Fuxing Academy, also went. In such a hot summer, lecturing on the sutras to calm the mind is very good, but it is a pity that most people who are busy all day long cannot comprehend this learning of calming the mind and cultivating the nature.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the sixth month of the lunar calendar, the sky in Hangzhou has not seen the slightest sign of rain. We cannot help but be moved by the diligent spirit of the farmers plowing and watering in the fields. How do they get rid of this long summer heat? Only after work, drink three small glasses of white wine and eat four cloves of garlic as the only good remedy for relieving the summer heat.</p>

<p>Legal Interpretation</p>
<p>Refusal to Vacate After Expiration: A Dispute Over Rice Mill Lease</p>
<p>Dear Editor, my ancestors left a rice mill, but no one operated it after the war. Then, it was rented to Mr. Zhang for operation, with a contract of two years, which has now expired. Mr. Zhang insisted on renewing the lease, but repeated negotiations were ineffective. Now, I plan to resort to the law, but civil lawsuits require the payment of the subject matter of the claim. I am now working in a professional institution. My three meals are still insufficient, how can I pay this huge amount of the subject matter of the claim. I have always admired your lawyer's service to the people. Now, I have the following points, please give instructions. I am very grateful. (1) The lease was signed on April 1, 1945, for a term of two years. At that time, it was stipulated that the lease could not be subleased during the lease term, but the factory added business registration in April 1946. I believe that there were obvious abuses, and I intended to terminate the contract, but I was dissuaded by the mediator. Now, the factory has added business registration again, and the lease contract expired on March 30 of this year. Can I stop its business and limit the time for it to move out? (2) If I am unable to pay the subject matter of the civil lawsuit, can I request the court to postpone or waive the payment? Xu Zhenzhi</p>
<p>[Answer by Lawyer Zhu Yabu:] (1) Since the lease contract stipulates that subletting is not allowed, and the lessee does not comply with the terms of the lease contract and subleases the house in question, a lawsuit can be filed to request vacating. (2) You can request litigation assistance. As for the litigation fees, they are slightly collected at the rate of thirteen thousandths of the value of the subject matter.</p>

<h3>Tagore's "Patriotic Song"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Dai</p>
<p>I once read an article about Tagore, saying that Tagore's works were introduced to China as early as the 8th or 9th year of the Republic of China. Before that, the literary world had never heard of Tagore's name. But another said that Tagore's works had already been introduced to Chinese readers as early as the 5th year of the Republic of China. At that time, because I had not seen it myself, I naturally did not dare to add to it. Recently, when I went to Santiniketan to collect some "antiques," I unexpectedly found a broken and incomplete copy of the February issue of the 5th year of the Republic of China, "The Great China Magazine," edited by Liang Rengong.</p>
<p>Opening it up, I found an article "Introducing Taia'er" written by Ouyang Zhongtao. I think this "Taia'er" is Tagore. In addition to introducing Tagore's life and his theory, the article also contains several of Tagore's poems. This is probably the work that first appeared in Chinese literature mentioned above.</p>
<p>Here, I transcribe the translated "Patriotic Song" and the two poems with the original name "Iron."</p>
<p>Patriotic Song:</p>
<p>Oh, motherland, the place where my soul leads, built by my ancestors!</p>
<p>Loyalty is the end of life, I should dedicate my body to it.</p>
<p>I rejoice and sing, singing the beauty of the country;</p>
<p>Sometimes I turn my back and weep, weeping for the grievances of the motherland.</p>
<p>Although my arms are weak, I support the motherland, and my strength is stronger.</p>
<p>Who are you who are hurting the country? I will decide! I hear the Taia sword, I hold it bluntly!</p>
<p>Oh, motherland, the place where my soul leads, built by my ancestors!</p>
<p>Maxim:</p>
<p>You, provincial teacher bee, fly and swim in the sky, hungry for thousands of flowers, brewing good guests, so you cannot hide deeply in the cave.</p>
<p>Do not imprison yourself, narrow and filthy, and live in a day of expansion and governance, but also a new prison, feeling free to cross the garden walls.</p>
<p>The translation style is very classical, quite like Yan Fu and Lin Shu, respecting tradition and emphasizing the style of rules. But it is concise and readable, and it is still not a bad translation. However, at that time, whether anyone noticed that this "Taia'er" was the Tagore who later became famous in China, it is not known.</p>
<h3>The Abandoned</h3>
<p>— Lu Yu</p>
<p>Last autumn, a certain XX army unit was stationed in the village.</p>
<p>The captain, surnamed Qiu, was a small man of medium height with a fair, square face, neither fat nor thin. He was very handsome, even though he was over thirty.</p>
<p>In less than a week, a rumor spread through the village: it was said that Amaotou’s mother had promised Amaotou to Captain Qiu.</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Is there anything false about it? Last night, someone personally saw Captain Qiu and her walking arm in arm from town; behind them was a soldier carrying a package of clothing material under his arm..."</p>
<p>Since this rumor was revealed, those who liked to gossip began to use it as big data for conversation in taverns and teahouses.</p>
<p>Amaotou’s family only had an elderly mother. The two relied on the dozen or so acres of land left by her father after his death to make a living. Although she only had a sixth-grade elementary school education, she was the only literate girl in the village.</p>
<p>She usually liked to wear foreign cloth; her hair was already cut short like a female student. She often applied snow cream to her face, and she liked to learn fashion from the girls in town. However, the surroundings of this village were still very feudal, so the people in the village had long held her in contempt.</p>
<p>A month later, for some reason, the troop stationed in the village suddenly received an order from above and busily prepared to move elsewhere. So, the night before, Captain Qiu specially came to her house to say goodbye.</p>
<p>"What, you're going too? How can that be?" her mother said when she knew she was going.</p>
<p>"Mom! Didn't you already promise me to him? Why are you objecting now?" she suddenly replied to her mother.</p>
<p>"It's not that Mom is objecting, but I'm saying you haven't even gotten married yet. What does it look like if you go with him now?"</p>
<p>"He wants me to go back with him. He said the people in the troop move around and don’t have a fixed place, so they can't be scattered in the future."</p>
<p>"………………"</p>
<p>Her mother was silent for a long time, feeling very regretful in her heart.</p>
<p>"Mom! Don't be sad. Now it's the new way. Marriage can wait until later," she finally said to her mother with a reassuring tone.</p>
<p>That very night—a dark night without a moon—Amaotou finally left the village with Captain Qiu's troop.</p>
<p>After Amaotou left, the people in the village criticized her behind her back, saying:</p>
<p>"Amaotou is getting worse and worse. I can't believe her mother let her go..."</p>
<p>Later, according to what her mother said to others, "I only blame her father for letting her study for a few years. The little girl changed. Last time my sister-in-law came to arrange a marriage for her, the little girl not only didn't agree, but also said that marrying a farmer would never allow her to get ahead in life. I didn't expect that Captain Qiu came and they were messing around together after only a few days. I could see that they already had a relationship, so for the sake of the Zhu family's reputation, I just went along with it. I only have this one daughter. As long as she is willing, that's all that matters! It's very difficult being a parent now..."</p>
<p>Days passed like flying. This summer, Amaotou suddenly returned from Shanghai on a steamship to her hometown, which she had left for fourteen full months. When she passed by the neighbors in the village, she quickly slipped past, feeling a burst of indescribable shame in her heart. However, when she stepped into the village, someone had already spotted her in the fields.</p>
<p>"Amaotou is back!"</p>
<p>"Amaotou is wearing a white coat and white leather shoes..."</p>
<p>"Look! Amaotou has turned into Guanyin Bodhisattva..." especially the children shouted madly.</p>
<p>Amaotou quickened her pace and ran home. When she saw her mother's face, she couldn't help but cry. Anger and resentment surged into her chest.</p>
<p>"Ah, Amaotou! You're back. Mom missed you so much! You haven't sent a single letter in over a year," her mother said as the first sentence. However, Amaotou walked into the room and collapsed on the bed, covering her face with her hands, silent for a long time.</p>
<p>"Amaotou! Are you seasick? Are you tired from the journey?" her mother went over and took one of her hands, saying: "Eh! What's wrong... tears are coming out?"</p>
<p>"………" She still didn't answer, but started to cry out loud.</p>
<p>"Tell me, what exactly is going on?" her mother asked anxiously.</p>
<p>After a long time, she finally said in a low voice, weeping:</p>
<p>"He has completely changed..."</p>
<h3>Ascending Ziling Fishing Terrace</h3>
<p>— Luo Junti</p>
<p>In the sixth month, one still wears light clothes, and strange events ultimately shock customs. Once in the imperial capital, one travels a thousand miles to visit a lofty recluse.</p>
<p>The fishing terrace retrieves silk cords, while carriages gallop through Kyoto and Luo. How can they compare to wearing rough clothes and fishing in the spring river?</p>
<h3>Lamenting at Xie Gaoyu’s Tomb While Ascending Ziling Fishing Terrace</h3>
<p>— Luo Junti</p>
<p>Song Jun had Wen Tianxiang, and Tianxiang had Xie, the military advisor. The relationship between the lord and the advisor was like fish and water, and the relationship between the province and the subject was like dragons and clouds. If it weren't for the rebel Zhang Hongfan, Jingnan and Zhao Prefecture might not have sunk and fallen. The advisor also lived in the fields, but the enemy forces descended on Linan and were unstoppable. He diligently raised troops and scattered his family wealth, starting an uprising in the desert alone. Alas, success or failure depends on heaven, and war or peace depends on oneself. It is better to die in battle than to surrender, and one's lonely army can only depend on its strength. When he heard that the young lord had died at Yishan and that the chancellor had died in Yanjing, the advisor's grief and righteous indignation were difficult to contain. He did not become a leftover subject or a fugitive, wearing hemp clothing and a rope belt, running through the mountains and marshes. The clouds and mist are like those of yesteryear, feeling sad at the thought of old friends. I secretly ascend Ziling Fishing Terrace, at a time when the weather is cool and the wind is stronger. I set up sacrifices and pour wine to summon the soul, singing sorrowfully and weeping, lifting bamboo and stones. The bamboo and stones shatter, and the liver and intestines split. The shame of the fallen province, when will it be avenged? The hatred of the subject, when will it be extinguished? The clouds are gloomy and the heavens and earth are sad, the water splashes and the ghosts and gods weep. Ziling Fei is proud of his loftiness and takes no responsibility for the rise and fall of the world. How can passers-by only know the name of Ziling Fishing Terrace, and not know that Gao Yu's tomb is on the side of Ziling Fishing Terrace?</p>
<p>Pausing, she continued, sobbing, "After I left, in less than a month, he took me to Shanghai, and I found out that he was a married man. At the time, I thought the deed was done, so I endured it all along. I didn't expect that recently, he picked up a vixen from who-knows-where… He has completely changed…" She didn't finish speaking, and lifted her left leg for her mother to see; she told her mother that the blue marks were from him kicking her with his leather boots...</p>
<p>This was like a bolt from the blue, and her mother was stunned.</p>
<h3>Tilanqiao and Flower Street</h3>
<p>— Li Weichu</p>
<p>Tilanqiao, this is a beautiful name. When I saw it for the first time, it made me think of the story of the water flooding the Blue Bridge that I often heard in my hometown as a child—this story is almost as famous as Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, although "籃" (basket) is not "藍" (blue). Later, after passing through the tall walls of the Shanghai Prison, there were often many young women in blue clothes and plain skirts with sorrowful faces, and a few lightly made-up young girls carrying goods with tear-reddened eyes, standing there waiting expectantly. A friend said: This is truly "A Waterloo Bridge of the Soul"! So I told her that every time I passed by here, I would always think of that famous movie; "Waterloo Bridge," the clear, beautiful, and expressive Vivien Leigh, the large and moving eyes, and the tune that made people's hearts intoxicated, like the murmuring of flowing water, these were deeply imprinted in my memory.</p>
<p>So, with many beautiful feelings in my imagination, I walked along the way, which was a very beautiful and famous little street here. Therefore, wouldn't you walk to the left? Then, I hope you walk to the left. The first facade is a small flower shop with a transparent glass room. In front of it, on the left, there were four or five flower stands with white, blue, and pink chrysanthemums, pale yellow large-petaled daffodils, bright purple roses, and bright red camellias. In addition, there were peach-red oleanders and pale yellow wild roses, all bright and beautiful, always attracting attention. Walking slowly past, not far away, there was another one, which was a larger branch store diagonally across from this one. The flowers and plants displayed here were more diverse and more expensive.</p>
<p>When I first walked into this street, it was a cool morning. It was my first time going to the office, and my heart was full of freshness. Just as I faintly smelled a faint and quiet fragrance in my nose, it quickly made me feel as if I was walking in the atmosphere of the ancient capital; there was a momentary trance of intoxication. This faint and quiet fragrance, transmitted to the bottom of my heart, gave me a quiet and distant meaning, and aroused memories and reflections of a distant dream. In Shanghai, a bustling, restless, and licentious Shanghai, is there such a mood? Yes, and this is in Peiping! So I recalled the cool and illusory taste of the ancient shore under the shade of the North Sea, the bright moon, and the crystal coolness of Wangdai Bridge, and I wanted to cry, but I felt comforted in my heart—until I woke up from this and looked around, I realized that all I saw was a patch of white. In front of the flower window, there was a whole patch of drooping night-blooming jasmine!... So I loved this street. I liked this little street just like I liked a quiet friend to talk with. Every day, at dusk or dawn, stealing a few minutes of leisure, I would rather walk a little farther to go there and see, lingering at the flower stalls, gazing at the flower shops, and paying attention to the flower varieties. I secretly called this little street Flower Street in my heart, or said: Flower Street in my soul.</p>
<p>And you, don't say: Am I intoxicated? Dreaming? Escaping? Or say leisurely sentiment, or say indulging in pleasures?</p>
<p>But, dear, in this extremely painful reality of life, in these helpless days, this is just a consolation, not an addiction.</p>
<p>(7/3, 3:00 AM, Shanghai.)</p>
<h3>Pine and Cypress of Nanshan (Painting for the Longevity Hall)</h3>
<p>— Wang Shengyuan</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 362</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>We all have a lot to talk about, and there are many opinions that must be exchanged. Yaogun definitely wants to know the situation of the headquarters these few days, and also wants to hear about Tsurumi's and Pingzi's work in Shanghai, as well as the current situation and location of the two people (she doesn't know that Tsurumi was called back to Tokyo for training). As for Zhan, he certainly wants to know that Yaogun and Little Tiger returned to Shenyang and Tianjin, how the two of them got separated in Tianjin, and how they got to Changping, all the experiences, etc.; how big is the strength she recruited, and why was someone arrested in Changping? What steps has she planned for Liu Ruming's actions, and so on. As for Dingyuan, I think his current environment and work are absolutely not suitable for him; if this continues, in less than two or three weeks, I'm afraid he will encounter a life-threatening danger. It seems that we should have a thorough review.</p>
<p>As soon as Little Tiger left, Yaogun indeed asked about the Beijing headquarters and Tsurumi. I told her that the Beijing headquarters was not as active as before on the surface. Besides looking for intelligence, it was only temporarily lurking. Kawashima Yoshiko and other dogs of the Matsu Group have not bothered us. Now we are contacting Song's troops in Zhuozhou and planning a counterattack; the counterattack will likely happen soon.</p>
<p>Secondly, I explained in detail what happened to me on the fifth day in Tianjin. Just as I was about to talk about Tsurumi, Little Tiger had hurried back, holding a note to Yaogun. After reading the note, Yaogun pondered slightly, then carefully folded it up and put it in her upper pocket; only then did she concentrate on listening to me tell the story of Tsurumi and Pingzi to Shanghai.</p>
<p>I told this story in considerable detail, because Yaogun was very concerned and had taught Little Tiger and Dingyuan a little bit about the people on both sides, and their spirit and preparations for the war of resistance. Little Tiger often listened with great interest; when I talked about the naughty Miss Zishan of Baininzhuang going to test Tsurumi's situation, he wanted to open his mouth to ask questions, but Yaogun stopped him. When Yaogun heard that the four young ladies had suddenly broken into the tiger's den and rescued Pingzi with a light touch, she also nodded and danced with joy, admiring them very much.</p>
<p>Only Dingyuan, who was not healthy, had lost his health after his illness. As for food and accommodation, I have already seen with my own eyes that the housing is these two broken thatched cottages; the food is definitely not good, just some gruel, how can it provide him with the nutrition he needs? Probably he didn't sleep well last night after coming back from me, so he felt tired while listening, just barely supporting himself, sitting for a while, then getting up and walking around. After walking a few steps, he couldn't walk anymore and ran to lie on the pile of grass in the corner. I know his temper. But I felt unspeakably uncomfortable in my heart. Since the July 7th Incident, the Japanese invaders have been rampant, and among the relatives and friends I knew, his experience was the most...</p>
<p>Just as I got to the point where Tsurumi returned to Beiping because I urged him, Da Dazi carried a package, gently put it down, and stood straight in the corner, staring at me with big eyes, waiting for a chance to speak.</p>
<p>"Is everything better?" I cut off Tsurumi's story and asked Da Dazi… (562)</p>
<h3>Thought · Landscape · Character</h3>
<p>— Fang Yu</p>
<p>If "friendship" can also be measured by "gold bars", I would rather be "lonely".</p>
<p>When a person who is honest, upright, and full of a sense of justice is driven by "greed", he has also chosen "funds".</p>
<p>I once lived in a damp, sunless underground hole, with no air, water flowing under my feet, and a foul odor permeating my nose. This is a "territory in paradise" in the "Eastern Paris" that ordinary people yearn for.</p>
<p>But just one floor above me, the landlady increased the price to eight gold bars, which is 160 million yuan at the current market price.</p>
<p>You calculate, how many lifetimes would it take for a working class or a civil servant to accumulate this terrible number.</p>
<p>But, you know, those 1947 streamlined cars, don't each of them cost more than a dozen gold bars?</p>
<p>Many people have no houses to live in, but many people, like incinerators, occupy many houses. They become nouveau riche out of nowhere, and become big customers in the coin-operated market!</p>
<p>A friend from Hong Kong tried his best to say how safe life in Hong Kong is, and how cheap things are.</p>
<p>It is said that when our call to reclaim Hong Kong was high, the new Governor of Hong Kong once declared: "Hong Kong should not be returned to China, it can be voted by Hong Kong residents"!</p>
<p>This is such a conceited and sharp diplomatic term, but it also contains a summary of many problems.</p>

<h3>Equal Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Wang Pingling</p>
<p>In love and friendship, those who are willing to suffer losses are mostly poor. Rich people also seem to have times when they suffer losses; but this is a speculative investment, and they hope to gain more rewards. Poor people generally have a generous and tolerant spirit, but unfortunately, the living resources of poor people are very limited. They also have to find ways to survive and do not have extra benefits to supply their exploitation. In fact, due to the helplessness of not being able to help, there may be times when promises to friends cannot be fulfilled. In this way, friends not only forget your past feelings, but often harbor permanent resentment due to temporary disappointment. In the end, the friends you think are the best all become strangers who have nothing to do with you; therefore, a person who loves friends the most has the fewest friends.</p>
<p>The fertilizer of friendship is mutual tolerance and concession. In case the other party is absolutely selfish, then absolute "altruism" is also a factor in maintaining friendship; because your friend often wants you to do things that meet his needs, giving up your rightful rights. After giving up, you must never complain publicly. The painful tears can only flow into your stomach, and when facing your friend, you must also endure the pain and pretend to be a clown-like smile, so that your friend thinks of his own success in your smile; and that is not the reward for what you have given up. In such a situation, it is the Chinese streamlined "way of making friends". What is friendship? "It is a kind of irredeemable loss that you constantly sacrifice for people you usually treat as friends."</p>
<p>When an unknown person suddenly becomes prominent, telegrams, eulogies, letters... will fly from all corners of the world. Although you don't know their names, they are all intimate, addressing you as brothers and friends, precisely because this person has extra benefits to meet everyone's needs; when he leaves the position of issuing orders and has nothing to meet everyone's demands, his door will be deserted. But sometimes, when the extent of your sacrifice for a friend exceeds the friend's ability to repay, the beneficiary often feels embarrassed and gradually becomes estranged from you, even deliberately avoiding you, not seeing you, for fear of causing shame and guilt; so those who are too fussy about friends, and whose sacrifices exceed the limit, fearing that friends will not be satisfied, are also people who have no friends.</p>
<p>Is there pure friendship in the world? Yes, the disciples of the sages say: It is a friendship of morality and justice. However, this explanation makes me even more confused. I think that pure friendship should be a kind of equal sacrifice between friends, that is, roughly the same amount of wading and loss. The interaction between countries is the same. As for the entanglement formed between men and women due to sexual demands, it is usually called love. The two parties who practice love call each other lovers, but in reality, it is also a kind of equal sacrifice that occurs between men and women.</p>
<p>With equal sacrifice, one party shows the fact of sacrifice, and the receiving party feels indescribable gratitude deep in their heart and wants to find an opportunity to repay it.</p>
<p>A feeling of gratitude is a burden on the conscience. When one is unable to repay it, one feels guilty. Friends forgive their mistakes with an overly generous attitude, or solve their difficulties with unexpected kindness. The feeling of gratitude arises spontaneously; however, those who are willing to sacrifice never want to accept the sacrifices of their friends. When it is absolutely necessary, they can only accept it. This is not a right, but an obligation, and they ultimately hope to have the opportunity to serve him and resolve this wish, although the friend who is prepared to sacrifice does not care about your repayment. Such behavior is the equal sacrifice shown between friends. Equal sacrifice can not only support friendship but also improve mutual trust and increase the element of purity.</p>
<p>Similarly, if there is such a thing in the world as a happy marriage that "declares the continuation of our pure love", I think it is nothing more than a helpless repayment in which one of the two parties receives endless grace, is moved to tears, and has nothing to repay. When a man and a woman recognize each other, feel satisfied, and begin to build a friendship, one of them will inevitably show the highest demand, anticipating a major defect that must be revealed in the other party's heart that is eager to make up for it, pressing him to use various techniques to create many gifts that are enough to make the other party feel grateful, and never hoping for any repayment, until the other party feels that only by contributing the last bit can he repay the burden on his soul, then the so-called pure love union is manifested in behavior in the form of an equal sacrifice between men and women.</p>
<p>Equal sacrifice is the proper way to make friends, and it can also be said to be the virtue of mankind; but this kind of "communication" is no longer common. At this moment, only one party sacrifices, and the other party is only absolute exploitation. Everyone is trying to absolutely exploit people and absolutely not be exploited by others. Therefore, the people who are seeking needs in the society are all in a state of danger, chasing and killing each other in the beauty of people, seeking profit, and capturing their prey. What is friendship? It is the diplomatic rhetoric of hiding a knife in a smile, the disguise of a robber, the crocodile tears of kindness, the meaningless prayer hummed by the professional priest when a criminal is executed!</p>
<h3>Qiu Weng Is Writing His Wartime Memoirs</h3>
<p>— Xie Zhangtao</p>
<p>To be Published in Full Starting Next Year</p>
<p>Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill is the only one who has been involved in the highest decision-making of World War II from beginning to end. During the war, he enthusiastically searched for and preserved various historical materials - letters, memos, meeting records, and other precious private diaries. Now, in the guise of being out of office, he is starting to write his historical magnum opus - his wartime memoirs. It will be published serially in "Life Magazine" and "The New York Times" starting next year.</p>
<p>Churchill became famous around the world after the last war with his two books, "The World Crisis" and "Marlborough's Journey". As for his role as the helmsman of the "Great Britain" during this war, leading this giant ship through terrifying storms and safely passing difficult sea voyages, it is even more valuable information for historians to describe with flourish; he deserves to be an outstanding reporter and a great statesman. Some people praise him as the only statesman and historian since Caesar, which is not an exaggeration. With his status as the decision-maker of the highest policy during the war, his rich historical materials, and his unique and famous Churchillian writing style, he will reveal the secrets of history, anecdotes, and history in his memoirs to the world. We sincerely hope to see Qiu Weng's great work.</p>
<h3>American Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Idle Chat About the Link Trainer</p>
<p>The aviation association has ordered the next twenty Lincoln trainers, which we refer to as Link trainers using the abbreviation "Linker." The applied instruments of this type of aircraft are exactly the same as those of a real aircraft, except that the Link trainer flies on the ground, not in the air. Its appearance resembles a child's toy car, the kind most common in American amusement parks, which can withstand countless bumps without breaking. After a person learning on the Link trainer sits inside and closes the canopy, they are sealed inside, as if flying blindly, unable to see any outside scenery. The instructor gives flight instructions by telephone. This kind of training is the most economical and safe. Before the invention of the Link trainer, instructors would fly with students several times before letting them go solo (single flight), which was very dangerous, sacrificing countless lives, and the consumption of fuel and aircraft maintenance was also considerable. Since the introduction of the Link trainer, each unit costs only one thousand U.S. dollars, and any middle-class family can buy one to play with. To make it even more popular, amusement parks can also install them for the general public to practice with. When I was at the Air Force Gunnery School, there was Jim Hanrly practice in the curriculum, which was a game of shooting at airplanes on a screen with machine guns. It was quite ingeniously made. During practice, airplanes appeared on the screen, and you aimed and fired. If you hit, there was the sound of a bullet hitting; if you missed, there was no sound. To guide your aiming, the teacher would add a film showing a red circle moving in front of the airplane on the screen, and shooting at the red circle would hit the airplane. There was also equipment to count the hit rate, recording how many shots were fired and how many hits were made. In reality, no bullets were consumed, and the effect of practice was achieved. This kind of equipment used in amusement parks for children's shooting training is economical and safe. However, anything becomes a gambling tool when it comes to China. Do you see the shooting stalls on the roadside? If you hit the target, you get cigarettes, wine and candy. The purpose of the people shooting is to get cigarettes and candy, not to practice aiming.

<h3>The Wonderful Life of Cockroaches (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tianhong</p>
<p>Considering that humans and almost all other animals unanimously want to eliminate it, it is indeed a wonder that the cockroach still exists! Birds and cats all detest it; wasps, frogs, hedgehogs, birds, cats, and dogs all eat it when hungry, and kill it for entertainment when bored. Humans are constantly using the most advanced and effective insecticides to deal with it, yet the cockroach still exists.</p>
<p>The cockroach has a strong and sturdy body to resist its persecutors. Although it is pot-bellied, it is a very capable athlete. When it unleashes its six legs to run, even the most famous runners cannot catch up with it. In case of emergencies, it can fully open its "engine" and fly away to escape danger. It can also shrink its body and hide in narrow cracks or crevices.</p>
<p>Speaking of eyes! The cockroach's vision has the greatest advantages of "red light" and "radar" and has existed for hundreds of millions of years. Its compound eyes, composed of more than 1,800 facets, can see clearly without any difficulty. It can see a small piece of food even in a very narrow crack.</p>
<p>You can submerge it underwater for twenty minutes without harming it at all!</p>
<p>It also has the amazing ability to regenerate limbs. If it sticks its nose where it shouldn't and gets it cut off, it will grow a bigger—perhaps better—nose in a few days. Many records can prove that if a cockroach's leg is cut off, it will grow back.</p>
<p>The cockroach's intelligence is no less astonishing than its physical strength. Compared to crickets, it can simply be called a genius. Crickets chirp incessantly, letting enemies know their location and endangering their own lives. Cockroaches, however, do not make a sound—so they are much safer.</p>
<p>When dealing with problems, cockroaches' solutions are also more clever than those of other insects. For example, an ant encounters two pieces of food—one is delicious but too big to drag, and the other is light but not tasty—it will drag the delicious one away, groaning under the heavy burden. If it were a cricket, it would spend a lot of time eating both pieces. But what about the cockroach? It will eat the heavy piece on the spot and take the small piece back.</p>
<p>This kind of ingenuity can explain why cockroaches have multiplied beyond all other animals, large and small, from prehistoric times, and why "paleontologists" sometimes call the "Carboniferous Period," more than 200 million years ago, the "Age of Cockroaches."</p>
<p>Cockroaches are extremely capable navigators, so their traces can be found all over the world. When the Greeks sailed overseas for expeditions, cockroaches hid in the cabins and conquered new lands with them. In the "New World," they were also among the earliest immigrants.</p>
<p>Russian farmers firmly believe that "Prussian" cockroaches, mixed with wine, can cure edema. Many epicures have claimed that "raw cockroaches" taste good, and that powdered cockroaches can be made into delicious sauces. Not long ago, the American health authorities discovered that a certain brand of leaf extract sold in "Philadelphia," a very cultured city, contained cockroach ingredients.</p>
<p>Although I have praised the merits of cockroaches so much, I also know that they can spread dangerous diseases, so we must strive to eliminate them!</p>
