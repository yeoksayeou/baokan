<p>美國務院凝就特別援華方案明年初即向國會提出　〔美國新聞處華盛頓十七日電〕國務院發言人本日支持政府之援華政策，向參院撥款委員會保證，除當前之歐洲復與計劃外，政府將於明年初向國會另提援華之其體計劃。國務卿經濟事務帮辦索普告委員會稱：自對日勝利日以來，美國對華已提供十億美元以上，今後將有更多之需要。渠稱：自中國列入國會所批准之對法，義，奧臨時援助議案以來，國務院己在考慮中國之局勢。紫普稱：對華臨時救濟計劃能包括獲取小麥，煤油，食米，藥品及其他項目，但渠認爲若千救濟歐洲之特種需要，或將因對華所指撥之基金而受到限制。　〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕索普與國務部遠東司畏即前任駐華大使館公使銜參贊白德華，十七日均出席參院撥款委員會陳述意見，對於議員質問蘇聯是否援助中共問題避不置答。索普宣稱，戰後美國援華之數已逾十億元，包括聯總救濟，軍備租借及剩餘物資等項在內。國務部現正草擬特別援華法案，將在明年一月後提交國會，國會上屆會議通過之二千七百七十萬元援舉法案，亦在實施中。委員會主席勃里奇當場質問國務部，援助世界各國抵抗共產主義，何故未將中國列入。索普答稱不知。僅謂援華法案現正着手擬訂，此次法案限於緊急救濟歐洲各國。局以德又問供給中國政府軍火情形，白德華答稱，此事正在進行，空軍配備亦在其內。國務部除量近簽訂協定，以空軍配備供給中國外，並將批准裝運兵器與彈藥至中國。　〔合眾社華盛頓十七日電〕索普十七日向美參院撥款委員會提供一項臨時援華之預擬計劃，準備在救濟案中授權供中國用之六千萬最後爲國會指定撥款以後，立即能加動用，渠稱：該項基金或將作下列之用：　對米穀之分配，將與義大利救濟法案相似，即以約近二千四百萬，供此項之需。　供三千八百萬桶石油及石油產品之用者，約爲一千八百萬。　此項計劃收支相抵後之剩餘款項，則將供多購米糧或棉花之用。此尚爲國務部在援華基金如加批准後，援華計劃內容之首次透露。（京政界對魏德邁力促援華之反應刋二版左角）</p>
<p>蒲立特周以德力主經濟及軍事援華中國目前戰事乃第三次大戰序幕　〔聯台社華盛頓十七日電〕前駐蘇大使蒲立特，十七日在參院撥款委員會宣稱：援助中國，應先於援助法，義，奧三國。政府現以軍火資敵，國會則拒絕以軍火資助友邦。國務部有充分時間撥訂救濟方案，並允在明年一月後提交國會，不幸國務部之政策完全誤信蘇聯乃1愛好和平國家，且中共僅係農地改革主義者，與莫斯科方面無涉。目前雖幸覺悟，但在思想與設計之間曠日已久，一部份參議負詢問蒲氏是否認為國務部防害討論進一步援助中國。渠未直接答復，僅稱：駐華大使司徒雷登迭次急電要求增加援助，然並禮常覆電亦未獲得，此事在華府及其他各地盡人皆知。撥款委員會主席勃里奇又問，美國駐華各代表是否勝任，蒲氏答稱：吾人亟需第一流人才，處理在華全部購益。軍事旣居至上地位，美國必須派遣夢帥使華。麥帥如果不克前往，則應改派具有對付共產黨經驗最富之將領前往，克拉克將軍即其一例。蒲氏又謂，美國戰時會供給中國以兵器與軍火，但自一九四六年五月至一九四七年五月又禁止對華輸出，自是以還，中國從未獲得一盒彈藥，以充實美國製迭之步槍，或一枚砲彈以充實美國製造之大砲。中國政府軍隊，正與配備精良之共軍對抗，共軍配備至少一部份來自蘇聯攫奪之東北工廠。　同時，眾議員周以德宣稱：援助中國乃避免與蘇聯及其附庸各國發生第三次世界大戰之最佳方法。吾人不必將中國列入目前討論撥付之緊急援外經費內，但至少應留出六千萬元以備早日援華。中國目前戰事並非內戰，而係第三次世界大戰之初次小接觸，保持中國政府强盛，並助其擊敗共產主義，實屬必要。東北日軍投降時，蘇聯即攫奪日軍兵器與給養，留待共軍佔有。除非中央政府進得美國道義，經濟及軍事上之支持，否則不免垮台，而由共產生義統治亞洲，勢同野火燎原。中國乃全世界大國之一，若受蘇聯支配，實甚危險。</p>
<p>援外案中國部份美眾院通過刪除法案已送參院討論　〔聯合社華盛頓十七日電〕眾院十七日口頭表決，通過撥款委員會建議，於援外案五億九千七百萬元中，削减八千八百萬元，刪除中國救濟部份。該案現送參院討論，該院或將恢復原案，並列入中國部份。同日，社魯門總統則亦將五億九千七百萬元對中·法·義·奧四國援助案簽署。參院撥款委員會主席勃里奇聞悉眾院表決結果，即稱當召集參院撥款委員會，於十八日實行表決，並稱：渠私人希望列入中國部份，惟委員會如何表決，則難尚言。氏稱：「中國已爲美國考慮中之孤兒，於舉世防止獨裁及共產蔓延中，應受優待。」渠希望參院撥款委員會能將法案於星期五中午提付參院表決。</p>
<p>加拿大售我軍火第二批啟運來華　〔聯合社加拿大英屬哥崙比亞凡庫佛十八日電〕港務當局宣稱，小型槍砲彈藥一千五百餘萬發，與空軍地面配備數百噸，價值一百廿萬美元，定於十八日開始裝上「柯里瑪」號輪船，十九日馳往中國吳淞，以供中國軍隊之用。渥太華方面政府人士聲稱，是爲中國近向加拿大洽購一千零五十萬美元蚊式飛機之一部份，全係經濟事務，並無政治動機。根據雙方協談，加拿大當裝出剩餘飛機一百七十架，連同槍砲彈藥及地面配備。此係第二次交貨，第一次已在數週前自蒙特里奧啟運。</p>

<h3>美國援華問題的分析</h3>
<p>美國緊急援外法案，經過參眾兩院熱烈討論之後，卒獲協議，仍將援華列入法案內。美國朝野對於援華問題的意見雖極紛紜，但經兩院一個月來的討論，各方意見可謂已趨於一致；抑且此項法案業經杜魯門總統簽署成立，援歐援華，等量齊觀，同樣重要，不分軒輊，論理應不再發生問題了；詎意忽又生枝節，眾議院撥款委員會，竟主張將援外基金削减八千八百萬元，包括中國之六千萬元在內，前天我們聽到了這個消息，對於撥款委員會的橫加阻撓，並不十分重視，而且相信這個議案，必爲眾議院所否決，但據合眾社華府十七日來電稱，眾議院已通過撥款委員會的削减案，並已送交參議院討論，眾議院的出爾反爾，眞使我們百思不解。美國援華問題，可謂一波三折，使我們最關切美國政情的人，也好像墜入五里霧中了。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統此次召開國會，原來是爲了緊急援歐問題，卽以杜魯門總統在國會所發表的咨文而論，也沒有隻字涉及援華問題；但是共和黨的領袖以反一般同情中國的議員，對於杜魯門總統的緊急援外計劃未將中國列入，一致表示不滿，並以先歐後亞攻擊社魯門總統；眾議院外交委員會首先提議美國應在援外基金內撥出六千萬元援助中國，經眾議員周以德的一番努力，便使衆院外交委員會予以通過；同時美國的外交家十二人，聯名向參議院外交委員會呼籲，對華予以軍事的及經濟的援助；美國與論界亦一致主張，美國應立即全面援助中國，但參議院於十二月一日通過五萬九千七百萬元援歐法案，並未加以重大修正；因此美國國會乃有兩種援外法案，一是眾議院外交委員會所提出的援外法案，包括援助中國六千萬元在內，後經眾議院於十日予以通過，另爲參議院所通過之緊急援外法案，與杜魯門總統所提出的，並無重大出入，並未將中國列入法案內。依照美國政治上的慣例，當參眾兩院對於某一法案的意見相左的時侯，即須與參眾兩院舉行聯席會議，商得一個妥協法案。本月十二日舉行第一次聯席會議，竟因意見紛歧而未獲協議，但至最後始成立折衷辦法：　將中國列爲緊急援外法案中四受助國之一；　援外基金總額仍爲五萬九千七百萬元；　中，法，義，奧，四國各應得若干，未加規定，而由撥款委員會決定之，於是，這一個折衷法案乃於十五日爲參眾兩院所通過。</p>
<p>我們研究這一個折衷法案J從表面上看來，中國已列爲四受助國之一：但是按之實際，也有受不到援助的可能。因爲在這個折衰法案內有一個附帶的條件，「凡是保留作爲援華基金的，均得動用以援助其他三國。」所以中國至何時始獲得美國的緊急援助，還要視國務院何時提出其具體的援華計劃而定。由此說來，眾議院撥款委員會主張削减援華基金，決非偶然；抑且有人說，緊急援外法案，不能完全以國際政治的眼光視之，而且還要顧及美國國內的經濟情况，應由外交委員會與撥款委員會共同商決之。所以撥款委員會的提案，從窄狹的美國經濟的角度去觀察，實在不足爲怪；但是眾議院出爾反爾，才是天下的怪事呢！眾議院通過之後，削减案現已提交參議院討論。昨天美國合眾社及聯合社對於美國是否援助中國一項問題所報道的消息，不啻紛至沓來，有的是互相重複的，也有的是自相矛盾的，極盡其錯綜複雜之至。我們把他們綜合起來，有下述各點：　眾議院已通過撥款委員會所提出來的削減法案：　以「貪污無能」攻擊中國政府的魏德邁將軍。向參議院撥款委員會呼籲，主張美國應以經濟的軍事的援助畀予中國，並對於蔣主席領導中國軍民對日抗戰的功績，稱道備至；　國務院幫辦桑爾普宣佈國務院已擬就長期援華計劃，一俟經費有着，即將開始實行；並謂美國以糧食煤油供給中國，亦爲美國援華計劃的一部份：　以「遊華　觀」一文轟動會世界的原作者　立德，又在參議院某一委員會上發言，再度主張美國應派麥　前往中國，如麥　不能分身，則應派克拉克將軍前往中國。</p>
<p>在這些報道裏，我們可以看出美國的亂，不僅美國政府對於中國舉棋不定，而且輿論界的意見，仍　紛歧。或許這種亂紛紛的現象，就是美國民主政治的特質，但是我們不能不指出，美國朝野對於今日的遠東局勢以及中國政情，迄今尚無正確的認識。一般美國人不僅不知中國共產黨爲何物，而且對於遠東共產國際的成立，也不知如何提高其警覺，以防患於未燃；老實說，國際關係發展到現階段，世界和平早已不可分割；第一次世界大戰之後，美國尚有所謂孤立派，後來事實證明，美國即欲置身事外，亦不可能：故至第二次世界大戰之後，孤立派早已銷聲匿跡，但是「歐洲第一」的觀念，依舊根深蒂固，牢不可破。美國政府的對外政策，如果突不破這一層陳腐的舊觀念，則將來必招致不可臆測的滔天大禍。美國應該歐亞並重，尤應積極援助中國，我們不願再有所費詞，但願美國朝野對於當前的世界大局，速決賢明的抉擇，尤應注意對外政策的統一性，這種模棱兩可自相矛盾的態度，不論對於世界和平或是對於美國本身的利益，均屬有害無益的。</p>

<p>〔合眾社南京十八日電〕魏德滬在華府參議會撥款委會中力陳援華之必要。此間國民政府方面認爲此乃勝利後最令人興奮之美援　之發展。政府人士態度之根據，爲魏氏在參院委員會中所發表之意見，無疑與其　密報告中之建議相同，而國務院對華政策之形成，魏使報告具有決定性影響。</p>
<p>魏使離華之日，發表文告，對中國政府作嚴厲之批評，中國政府數要員曾因此而反駁該幽視察不週。魏氏在參院委員會中之陳詞，第一次透露其對中國政策之見解，若干方而寬火爲驚異。說時非正式電訊曾稱杜魯門及馬歇爾業已批准魏氏之援華報告，然在發現提出援華計劃之良策前，擱置魏使報告，不予公布．今者此項電訊似頗言之成理。此間以爲美政府所以遲遲不公布報告，蓋擬先解決緊晃　援歐計劃及倫敦外長會議。</p>
<p>消息靈通人士相信，國務院不立即公布報告另有一因素，蓋　一日　　之建議公布，中國政府不致因受魏　之策略為：如中國政府無法獲　美國之行動，則政府廳魏氏號召而自力更生之機會較大，由此中國更值得援助。</p>

<p>緊急援外法案規定經費內，撥付相當數目援助中國。</p>

<h3>德境佔領區經濟合併美英簽訂新協定美負擔全部經費四之三取得德貿易更大管制權</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦十七日電〕英美修正德境英美區合併協定之新協定，已於十七日在倫敦及華盛頓同時公布。內容規定由美國負担英美區全部需要美元購買之輸入，而英美佔領區之全部支出亦由美國負担四分之三。英國同意供給並支付得自英鎊區購買之全部必需輸入品，而德國進出口政策之管制權，將按費用負担之多寡，由英美比例分担。此1協定乃兩國政府經十星期餘之時間談判之結果，將使德西部實際上成爲硬幣國家，並將迫使英國增加英鎊區糧食以外之對德輸出，以償付獲自德國之木材等物。英國根據此1協定，可以免除以美元抵補德國入超之義務，此等入超額本年約在五千萬至六千萬鎊之間。至於美國之取得德國進出口政策及外匯基金之更大管制權，亦經英國承認爲公允之舉，蓋美國業已慨允負担全部美元費用。官方文告同時並鄭重聲明，除對於進出口政策及外匯基金之管制權有所變更外，其他對於合併區經濟政治或軍事政策之控制權，仍按現行制度，即英美各負担其半之制度施行。美國依照本協定而須增加負担之美元費用，明年估計將達四億元。協定復規定，美政府鑒於英國嚴重的美元困難，同意儘可能調整英美區進出口機構之活動，使在一九四八年內英國所需承兌之英鎊，以不逾美金四千萬元爲限。茍由於承兌而使英國之美元資源不勝負担時，仍得由英政府在英美區聯合委會提出此一間題，必要時且得由兩國政府從事討論，以覓取堪爲美政府接受之减少承兌措施。協定規定由英國政府發付價值八百五十萬鎊（合三千四百萬美元）之物資或金錢，以給濟自一九四七年十一月一日至十二月卅1日之費用。英國於一九四八年內，應自英鎊區輸入德境英美區價值一千七百五十萬鎊（台七千萬美元）之物資，同時並提存四百廿五萬鎊（合一千七百萬美元）以供必要時自英鎊區輸入物資之用。英政府此外並須撥船卅三艘，於本年十一月至十二月內自美國戰運物資赴德，在一九四八年內英政府每月應負責自美國港口運輸十二船之物資至德。此一協定並不計及佔領軍及德籍職員之維特費，如將此等費用計算在內，英美兩國在合併區內分担之費用，約爲一與三之比。</p>

<h3>中年婦人身中廿八刀宋公園路浜邊命案真相大白借貸不遂遽下毒手心狠乾兒終被戈獲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕閘北宋公園路象儀港明强中學前之小河浜邊，曾於本月三日淸晨，發現一被害之中年婦人，全身共中刀傷達二十八處，死狀頗慘。此一驚人之兇殺案發生後，本市警察局刑事處及該管大塲警分局極爲重視，即由酈科長，親率第一股長朱夢咸，科員陳先榮，馬斐穆，警長賀耀祖，及大塲警分局長張有佺，司法股長何培基，股員劉子常等從事偵査，歷時三日始獲知死者名張宋氏，年四十八歲，紹興人，兇手則爲氏之乾兒李仲鑑（又名阿速）年二十六歲，爲前黃陂南路貝勒里十二號楊榮記織襪廠工人，後經偵悉其行兇動機，爲借貸未遂。</p>
<p>懷恨而起</p>
<p>緣死者向住鄕間，近因生活困難，於本年十一月初致函與滬地共和新路夏福里六號同鄕人金運發，托其覓屋，擬來滬開設小店舖，二週後氏接覆函謂屋已覓得，囑其來滬，其時適兇手李仲鑑自滬返鄕，經死者邀其同來滬上，於十一月廿三日抵滬。暫宿於順昌路大康里九十三號李之未婚妻杭州人章藉英家，惟死者其時即對李，蓋死者亦生有一女名美珠</p>
<p>破表不滿</p>
<p>，原擬許配興李，今見好事不成，遂乘機以乾媽身份，不時將李辱駡，及後知李與章女即將完婚、心灰意懶，李猶不知底細，竟向死者吿貸結婚費五百萬元，當遭拒絕，是時李懷恨在心，乃於上月底悄然離滬返鄉，至陶里姚家樓死者之子張阿瑞處詭稱：汝母在滬房屋雖已覓妥，但需頂費一千三百萬元，　其設法籌齊，由彼帶滬。張於籌集現款後，要求同行來滬，迨母于見面，</p>
<p>騙局拆穿</p>
<p>，李當塲被死者痛駡一頓，當夜張子宿於共和新路福昌里六號同鄉金連發處，而死者則仍宿於李之未婚妻處。惟彼母子曾相約於本月二日下午鄂時在北站會面，同返原籍，不料死者至車站時，因人衆未曾相遇，而李則匆匆趕至，見張猶徘徊車站，乃託詞謂其子尙在共和新路，遂陪氏同往，是時，李已懷殺心，預在海寗路四六九號張小泉剪刀店購得</p>
<p>菜刀一柄</p>
<p>，迨至宋公園路荒僻處，即袖出菜刀，將氏頭面手足部猛砍廿八刀，當塲傷重身死，乃將其所戴金戒捋去後即棄刀逃逸，至本月六日李知警探追索甚　，即離滬逃往錢塘江邊復興路月海橋馮阿大家，孰知天網恢恢，終於本月十五日夜，爲員警追蹤將其捕獲，前日押解來滬。李對謀殺直認不諱，警局即將移地檢處訊辦。</p>
<h3>細語風初飄瑞雪</h3>
<p>〔本報訊訊〕今年冬季是否降雪之謎已於昨日揭曉。皚皚雪花，夾以峭風細雨，整日飄降於本市上空。上海氣象台台長鄭子政本月十二日對本報記者至預測，至此已完全應驗。鄭氏當事係根據沿海一帶濕氣甚濃，而北方高氣壓寒流則在移動中，將於本星期內抵達華中與濕空氣遭遇，故預料可能降雪。此一西伯利亞反氣旋現果然三　罩全國，中心則在蒙古·新疆一帶。長江中下游如南京·九江·杭州等地均紛紛降雪，溫度大降，自南京以上宜昌以下多在攝氏零度以下。本市昨日最高溫度爲華氏三十八度四，最低爲華氏三十四度，合攝氏一度餘。預測今日天陰，仍有間歇性之飄雪，但將逐漸停止，明日將見晴朗。茲將該　天氣預測誌後：</p>
<p>黃海：　·晴　而冰凍，淸和北風至西風，中浪。華中：陰，較冷，局部降雪或　，淸和北風，晚有霧。上海：陰，間歇雪而冰凍至曩意，晚有輕霧，揚子下游局部降雪，情勁北風至西北風。東海：陰，沿海雨，强烈北風至東北風，台灣海峽風勢更烈，巨浪，台灣四周海浪更巨。最低溫度華氏三十四</p>
<h3>長江津沽水位銳落航輪附加潛水等費</h3>

<h3>萬福士輪　在港遇刦</h3>
<p>〔本報香港十六日航訊〕渣華輪船公司的萬福士號海輪被刦的消息，十五日午間傳抵香港的時候，市民很多「將信將疑」，因爲那是一艘四千多噸的海輪，而非行走內河的船隻。這幾個月來，廣東的內河不靖，就算往來省港間的輪船，也一再遭受悍匪的打單或甚至施放水雷，但海輪被刦的事，却以萬福士號爲戰後的第一艘。</p>
<p>萬福士輪由星加坡開往汕頭，曾在香港停留很短時間，也祇上了十個以下的乘客，而且有幾個是事後被匪綁去的人，因此，船公司的人便認定那廿多個海盜是早在星加坡登輪的，如此可見那些</p>
<p>海盜此次下手倒是經過十分週密計劃。海盜廿多人中，為首的兩個是張面的，大半說廣州口音。遇事地點是距香港五十海呷外的馬士灣，貼近共匪如毛的海陸豐海岸，當地人多說潮語，因此，海盜中也有一部份是說潮語的人。馬士灣（即大鵬灣）一帶久為廣東海盜出沒之區，戰前經常有英有艦在附近巡邏。半年以前，　慶輪遇風沉沒也在附近的海面。海盜衝入船長室，拔械制服船長和他的助手後，在船上</p>
<p>搜刦十五小時</p>
<p>之久。船長和船員在海盜槍桿威脅下，無從抵抗，所以全部過程沒有流血慘劇，但海盜得手後，下艇而逃之時，却强綁去乘各六名。內有汕頭僑務局長陳伯璇，陳嘉庚公子陳傑昌，汕市銀行行長白祺甫等人，其仍留在船上的親屬，目擊他們被迫而去，傷心流涕，而同輪乘客莫不見之凄然。海盜旣得財物，而猶擄人強索，尤爲同類事件中之罕見者。</p>
<p>船上乘客損失</p>
<p>以頭等艙為最。聽說在坡幣一百萬元以上，另有金飾手錶等物，裝滿一大木盤。船上計有頭二等客七十一名，大艙客一千五百餘各，船員一百廿九名，船上自衛檐械亦被携去。海盜洗刦得手後，一說謂有帆艇三艘駛來接應返岸，一說謂海盜在船上鳴槍威脅附近漁船駛來接載，兩說孰是孰非，尚無從查悉。</p>
<p>萬福士號被刦後，即駛返香港報案，今天下午才開往汕頭去。（特約記者子健）</p>

<h3>市長首次敎育巡視　昨晨偕李熙謀冒雪出發　盛讚女師教學情形良好</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳市長對本市敎育向極關　，前因政務繁劇，未能親往各校視察。日前決定抽暇親赴本市各中小學參觀，作接任本市後首次敎育巡視。昨日淸晨八時卅五分。瑞雪初飄，敎育局代局長李熙謀即至市長官邸迎候。於八時四十分偕同冒雪出發。首至愚園路市立女子師範參觀，由該校校長陳鶴琴，師範科主任楊志光，及專修科敎師經小担等，陪同至全校巡視一週。該校校址，在戰即原爲工部局滬西學校女十部，太平洋戰起，白雪曾作軍營，勝利後敎局設市立女子師範於此，下分師範，專修，小學，幼稚園各部，現有學生一千餘人。因校舍不數，專修科等均於活動房屋中上踝。一部份校役宿舍及則所等，則設於布帳篷內。吳市長及李代局長逐一至各敎室巡視，對學生之作業成績及壁報加以詳讀。市長對該校推行「活敎育」之設施，頗感興趣。後市長又冒雪踏勘該校校後空地，因靜安區學齡兒童失學者尚有八千名以上，爲校舍限制無法容納，該校乃擬加建房屋，校後有四畝餘空地一方，正可適用。將來擬由敎局撥款一億，區公所自籌二億，作爲興建經費。市長於察勘後，囑詢明地主，以便接洽收購，或租賃造屋。巡視畢，市長復應該校之請，在大禮堂向集合之一千餘師生訓話，首先陳述參觀後之印象，認爲敎師敎學及學生學習情形，均頗良好，此因陳校長爲著名之敎育專家，並賴敎職員之努力，方有此結果，對此非常欣慰。</p>
<p>勗勉怎樣做人</p>
<p>市長繼勗勉二點：　對自己要有信心：日前顏應慶博士曾與談及新近看過兩本書，其一爲英人所著，稱譽此世界對社會文化與思想有貢獻之偉人共有六名。另一美人所著，則稱譽偉人有八名。但其相同者，則爲六名與八名中，皆包括我國之孔夫子與老子二人在內。故國人幸勿自暴自棄，而一昧稱賞外國好，國人本身，亦有其優秀之創造能力。　敎育不但敎人智織，更應敎人怎樣做人：孔子之論語與老子之道德經，雖著作時代，至今相差二千餘年，但其所述道理，至今尚屬眞實。當前物價高漲，物慾積流，根本問題，皆因國人將固有之學術與道德基礎，完全放棄或毀壞，而自歐美學習者又祇爲皮毛。國人如皆能將歐美之責任心（Duty），誠實（Honest），運動道德（Sportsmanship），以及中國固有之仁義禮智信，時時放在腦中而實行之，則中國必能成為強盛優秀之國家。師範學校之畢業生，將來敎人，除知識外，一定要敎他們怎樣做人。</p>
<p>吳市長李代局長繼轉往隔隣之市西中學，由該校校長趙傳家導往化學·物理·生物實騐室。圖書館。及各敎室參觀。高三甲教室之黑板上有白粉筆書寫之歡迎民主的吳市長及吳市長萬歲等中英文。市長巡視至此，未有表示。市西中學校址，戰前原爲工部局滬西學校（Western　School），故設備較爲完善，校舍寬敞，現有學生十九班，共七百六十人，女生佔三分之一，現已實行男女分班上課制。</p>
<p>詢問有無砂眼</p>
<p>市長於十時三十五分離市西中學，折往大西路十區第二中心國民學校參觀。該校校址，戰前原爲英軍兵營，佔地九畝餘，房屋皆爲木板平屋。現今出路不便，須自大西路六百二十弄折入，該弄爲一狹窄陋巷，曲折迤長，又不整潔，雪後更泥濘不堪。經市長與學代局長一再詢問後，始覓得校址所在，稍事休息，即由該校負責人陪同參觀各敎室及聲務室，市長對學生健康情形甚爲關懷，詢問學生中有無砂眼及肺病患者，據答稱砂眼患者佔百分之七十，肺病不多，但多半學生營養不良。市長於巡視全校後，認爲小學生日日必經之出路不便，甚爲不隹。該校負責人乃導往勘察大西路七三○號，可由該處打一條通路直達學校，此須與地政工務局接洽。吳市長當囑學代局長與地政局長訊局長商談。在寒雪中巡視至此，已屆正午十二時，預定往格致中學等處參觀，因時間不及，乃決定改日前往。</p>

<p>據悉：該公會於全盛時代，擁有會員二百四五十家，自政府於本年二月十七日頒佈經濟緊急措施方案，取締黃金買賣及外幣流通後，紛紛改業，如紙烟罐頭糖菓食品等，現計有會員一八八家，繳付會費者不足半數云。</p>
<h3>捲菸稅欵待解　銀根不易回鬆</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日國家行局　讀差入五八一億元，銀根緊勞已稍煞。暗息略低，自二角五分至二角七分。華股塲外多方貼息，亦减跌至三角四分半。惟聞今日仍將有大批捲烟稅款計一千餘億元待解，故銀根趨勢仍將轉緊。各行局中，中央差入四二入億，大交換出三二一億，外商入六七五億，小交換出九三五億，中國入一三四億，交通出一三〇億。</p>
<h3>呢絨許可證時效　輸管准延至年底</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據輸出入管委會秘　處息：　呢絨進口，經該會決議：「公佈前」許可證時效斯限，原來規定今年六月底為止，現准予展斯至本年底為止。　無證到埠進口貨物處理問題，經該會會義規定，附表三乙之進口貨品，（如紙烟，生皮，毛骨等，暫停進口貨品）。除呢絨一項外，若進口商不願重行出口者，可由中信局收購。且附表三乙之貨品，其性質與羊毛棉等貨品不同，故不適收購後出賣給原進口商，須由公開標賣之方式處理之。</p>
<h3>買戶胃口薄弱　紗布市况下游　四二支藍鳳細紗續瀉百萬元</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日棉紗市况。因下半年度結算期日近，各方頭寸仍屬軋緊，塲內吐售尙多，買戶甚鮮活動，惟客帮零星點綴，織廠臨收時略吸，比上日收價續瀉一百萬元。此外各紗亦均下游，僅四十支寳光人鐘，卅二支豐年等紗，各帮進取較健，市獨平穏。</p>
<p>又訊：昨日棉布市况，晨開時因魏使加緊援華之訊，空方壓制甚力，市趨下游，不久流言匯價變更，隔日浮空抵補，山西帮亦來活動，散戶跟進，價轉挺秀，詎至十一點後，紗價又吿不振，在疲檔徘徊，買戶胃口轉呆。迨至最後，十二磅龍頭及振中細布步降三千至西萬元，五福彩球藍鷄陽鶴等細布，則回升自五千至一·二萬元。此外漂布粗布及嗶嘰直貢等，亦軋好自五六千至三萬五千元，其餘各布市勢明平暗疲之局。</p>
<p>又訊：中國紡建公司，昨日循例售布，共售五三四〇疋，被單八〇條，申購單共一二五張。內廠商二張，購布二四〇疋，布號一二三張，購布五一〇〇疋，被單八〇條。</p>
<p>現棉沉寂</p>
<p>昨日現棉市易寥寥，半因銀根仍緊，週轉不靈，半因天氣關係，人員不齊，成交僅一筆，做開漢口細絨一二〇包，掉紗作價四九六萬，周浦籽花九〇萬。</p>
<h3>絲綢疲途徘徊</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市已降至本週配售價相仿，故竟日問無多大上落。一二〇號旭字有光，上午收盤價喊七千六百萬元，午後曾升至六百五十萬元，最後仍退喊上午收盤價賣出，但銀根甚緊，賣多於買，成交極稀。</p>
<p>廠經</p>
<p>徘徊疲途，昨市再呈低落。CD等級喊價已降至九千萬元關內。高零担八千六百萬元，且係七天期款喊價，仍乏人過問，故昨日交易，可稱絕無僅有。干經昨亦挫落一百萬元之譜，均無交易可言。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨市眞絲被面再吿銳降，華强貨開市成交價在三百八十萬元左右，旋即降至三四十萬元之間盤旋，卒因求脫者較多，收市挫至即期價三百萬元，比上日短一百萬元强。隔日套利始做五十萬元，繼升至七十萬元之鉅。其他各貨均吿低降，因受銀根緊縮之威脅，忍痛割斬者大有人在。</p>
<h3>收購本年度國棉　紡建擬就估計表</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紡調會為凖備統購原購方案，曾委旗紡建公司供給本年度國棉估計之收購統計。茲悉：紡建已根據實際資料，擬就精確之估計表。據估計：本年度棉季，至本年底為止，各廠可收購進倉之棉花，大致可達二百廠一百二十萬担。該批原棉，因係各廠自購，當不能列入統購之數字內。</p>
<p>茲姑以統購國棉，自明年一月起實施。估計自明年一月起，至新花登塲前為止，大致尙可收足三百萬担。以每担五百萬元計，則須資金十五萬億無元。估計統購國棉之轉週資金，約需六億元至七億元云。</p>
<h3>商業簡訊</h3>
<p>國際貿易促進會，定今日下午三時，假都城飯店召開成立大會，通過會章，選舉理監事。</p>

<h3>重申本刊的方針</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>本刋自從復刋　迄於今，足有十個月了。本刋復升的第一次，即與讀者初次相見的時光，即有一篇說明本刋的方針與態度的「開場白」，那就是梁俊靑醫師的大作，題爲「我們的立場」。時隔十月，我們檢討一下，這近一年來的工作成績，似乎還能照淸我們所定的工作方針做，沒有走錯路子，沒有多大　越我們所走的大方針。如其我們要說不够滿意的話，那就是：我們還沒有把我們所定的工作計劃，做到幾分之幾，或者說，我們的工作成績，還做得不够如理想中的美滿，但因報紙地位的寶貴，篇幅有限，不能容我們如心所欲的發揮，寶在也是其中原因之一。</p>
<p>最近，爲了檢討本刋過去的成績和今後的工作方針，曾召集了一次編輯的會議，重把編輯的方針和範圍，討論了一番，就中有幾個重要之點，似乎有重行申說的必要。</p>
<p>「新醫與新藥」這一個醫刋的名稱，原是延用小數年前申報原有醫刋的老名構。在這個醫藥的頭項上，加上于個新字，並非天天有什麼新發明，期期有什麼新花樣，貢獻給我們的讀者。這新醫新藥，是指現代醫藥或科學醫藥而言。因爲在我們中國，還有另一種舊有的醫藥存在。在醫藥的頭上加用上一個新字，就是和固有的舊聲藥有個區別。常初把刋物採用上這個名稱，其用意，恐怕就在乎此。這雖與什麼編輯方針沒有大關係，但以名正言順而言，這樣來解說一下，也是需要的吧。</p>
<p>如果說科學在中國，尚在幼稚的初級小學的時期，那末，科學新醫在中國，不客氣的說，還在更幼稚的幼稚園時期。其所以幼稚的原因，固有其種種客規上所以幼稚的因素，但國人之不重視科學，不重視科學醫藥，尤其對於近代科學新的本質和觀念，還沒有一個正確的認識，大部份國人的腦子，還滿裝着玄學的國粹觀念，玄醫的國寳思想，對於科學新醫的認識，還只有表面的，部份的認誤用，還未到徹底的堅決的信任的階段。這是科學新醫在中國推進不能開快步的大原因。要使科學新醫在巾國社會加速的推進，那末，只有如何地來喚醒國人對於科學新醫的認識和重視。只有國人個個重視科學，人人都認識新醫，始能加速科學新醫的建樹。亦只有上下一致的加速推進新醫事業的建設，始能配合近代新國家的建設。這是本刋頭一個切要的工作方針；過去如此，現在如此，今復亦後如此。</p>
<p>第二個的工作方針，也是一切通俗醫刋的工作目標，就是一句老調：宣傳衛生常識，灌輸醫藥常識。本刋今後的工作方針，似以此項目標，爲中心工作，爲我們的重要任務。中國的老百姓，不但經濟上的貧乏，也是知識上的貧乏，常識上的貧乏，尤其醫藥術生常識的貧乏，更爲顯著。誠然，常識的貧乏，是與經濟的貧乏，有着密切的關係，但亦有與經濟不全有關的部份。就如在這一類報紙醫刋上，寫作一些醫藥衛生常識的文字宣傳，就與一般老百姓的經濟少有關係。其惟一的缺點，即其效力，只限於少數識字階層的讀者，但這是莫可奈何的事實。我們所能留意的，只在乎寫作時技巧而已。換言之，寫作的技巧，能處理得當，宣傳與灌輸的效力，亦可以發生得廣大而深入一些。具體地來申說一下，就是　我們旣以宣傳或灌轍醫學常識爲目標的，我們下筆時，便要隨時注意以一般讀者爲對象，切不宜以醫者自身爲對象。換言之，應當通俗化，不宜專門化。　力求趣味化，力避說敎式的機械化，醫學知識，本是比較枯燥的東西，如其機械式，呆板板的寫起來，讀者一定會感到乏味的，這樣，對於我們宣傳灌驗的效力，就難免大打折扣，不易達深入與普遍的目的。這，當然還要看各人的寫作天資，才分，但我們只能以此自勉，並希望爲本刋寫作文稿的諸同人，予以注意耳。</p>
<p>第三，不是屬於工作的方針，而却應予注意的一點。這是屬於宣傳醫識時的取材一方面，這也是值得我們注意與一提的必要。這一醫刋，旣以宣傳醫學衛生常識爲重大的目的，我們今後主張儘量注重於預防攝養一方面的題材，對於處治聲療的一方面，則力求减少。因爲前者確屬於通俗醫識的範圍，而爲讀者所需要，讀了只有裨益，決無流弊，後者則多屬醫者本身的技術問題，讀者讀了，一知半解，並無裨益，如其偶有胡亂試驗，則流弊殊大，危險非凡。這殊非宣傳醫學衛生常識的作者所能始料的。我們只有事先加以注意，以防萬一，始能進免道一類意外的流弊。</p>
<p>第四，也是我們負責主編者以及爲本刋寫作，文稿諸同人，應予注意的，即本刋因限於篇幅，不宜於過長的長稿，最好每篇以一千至一千四五百字數者爲最合適。因過長的長稿，每致分期連續，這會使讀者感到不能一氣幸讀的通病。這要希望撰稿諸同人，尤其是外米投稿諸君加以注意的。</p>
<p>末了，還有一點值得向讀者報告的，就是我們今後在可能範團中，擬在每期刋登一二幅新穎的挿圖。這樣，也許會得增加讀者的一點興趣呢？</p>
<h3>醫樂的起源是愛</h3>
<p>— 王爵榮</p>
<p>派拉賽塞的話是對的！「醫藥的起源的確是愛」！在這世風不古，道德水準每况愈下的當兒，難怪醫事糾紛風起雲湧，我們做醫師的，除了請求合法的保障以外，唯一的防止方法，就是發揮這醫藥起源的「愛」！拿愛來做病人的「保證人」，用「愛」來代替一切的「志願書和保證書」。</p>
<p>只有「愛」，才能使我們發揮出更多的同情，更大的慈悲；在現在這戰雲瀰漫的世界襄，亦只有大家發揮出眞正的愛，才能消彌未來的人類浩刼於永久！</p>
<p>社會人士對牧師和醫師是崇敬的，因為企望過高，有時難免苛責，同樣的情形，社會人士對藥商和米商是需要的，一日不可或缺的！因爲需要之殷切，所以藥和米的漲價，也不免使人們對藥商和米商有所非難！</p>
<p>在這動盪的大時代中，正是我們道德和人格的試金石，願我們醫藥團體的領袖們，將我們醫師公會，牙醫師公會，藥師公會，助產士公會，藥劑生公會，護士公會，新藥業公會，製藥業公會八個休戚相關，利害與共的團體，聯繫起來，託取派拉賽塞的名言，爲這艱苦的社會人羣，負起神聖的使命，我們要用醫藥起源的「愛」，來奠定中國新醫和新藥的基礎！給社會人十以最好的印象！</p>
<p>「不論白天或黑夜，假若你願意的話，還是給自己的心猿上了鎖吧！有人正在叩門嗎？好！「請進！」管它是時常午夜；無需詢問來者姓名，只須問他，有無苦難，如他渴，他飢，……歡迎他，滿足他！」這是雨果先生在孤星淚上的另一段談話，我不僅提起了筆，給它接上了幾句，來結束今天的「診餘偶感」！</p>
<p>「如他有病痛，同情他，撫慰他，帮助他，拿他的苦痛，當做自己的苦痛，拿他的病孩，當自己的愛兒，這樣，我們絕不會再有疎忽，再有過失」！</p>
<p>雖然在現在的社會裹，少的是「愛」，多的是「恨」，祇要我們幾萬醫藥界同人，團結一致，發揮出我們神聖的「愛」，來說洗凈了一切人間的「恨」未來社會的安寗和幸福，要我們來做它的基石！</p>
<p>最後，願各界人士寄與我們以最大的同情和鼓勵！（續完）</p>
<h3>生理學製品概說</h3>
<p>— 汪美先</p>
<p>生物學製品（Biological　products）是基於細菌學血淸免疫學製造的成品，與醫學有重大的關係；不僅可以應用於病後的治療，而且可以防患於未燃，滅疫癘於無形，保持人類的健康。</p>
<p>生物學製品的應用是根據免疫學原理，接種於動物體，使自動的或被動的獲得免疫性，以預防或治療傳染疾患；首先發明的是琴納（Jenner）氏於一七七八年應用牛痘苗接種人類預防天花，一八八〇年巴斯德（Pasteur）氏亦應用病毒性减弱的炭疽，雞霍亂桿菌及狂犬病毒製成疫苗，以爲預防；一八九〇年伯靈（Behring）氏製造白喉毒素及抗毒素，一八九二年伯靈及北里（Kitasato）氏製迭破傷風毒素及抗毒互等，都是預防醫藥及治療醫藥上劃時代的創舉，在這一類發明與不斷進步中，人類的生存幸福，擭得充分的保障。</p>
<p>現今製迭而常用的生物學製品，有下列四類：　疫苗類：有由細菌（Bactevia）菌體製造的，包括霍亂單純疫苗，傷寒單純疫苗，霍亂傷寒混合疫苗，傷寒副傷寒混合疫苗，鼠疫苗，百日咳疫苗，防癆疫苗（B．C．G．）</p>
<p>有由病毒（Viruses）製造的，包括狂犬病疫苗（人用及犬，用兩種），斑疹傷寒疫苗等。</p>
<p>毒素類：由細菌所產生的外毒素（Exotoxin）製成，包括白喉沉澱類毒素，破傷風類毒素，錫克氏反應用白喉毒素，狄克氏反應用猩紅熱毒素等。</p>
<p>血淸抗毒素類：凡用細菌菌體注射馬匹免疫製成的，稱血淸（Sera），抗細菌本身——抗菌性（Anti-bacteria），包括鼠疫血淸，痢疾血淸等。凡用細菌外毒素注射馬匹免疫製成的，稱抗毒素（Antitoxins），抗細菌產生的外毒素——抗毒性（Antitoxic），包括白喉抗毒素，破傷風抗毒素，氣性坯疽抗毒素，肉中毒抗毒素等。　（未完）</p>

<h3>電氣麻醉法</h3>
<p>— 項隆周</p>
<p>科學的昌明，日新月異，各具其能，現代電氣一門，應用之廣，可說已無所不至其極，但應用於人體上的，尚屬少數，以前僅限於聲療上的聯助品，如X光的透視，紫光綫的皮膚治療，而直接應用於人體者，可謂絕無僅有，茲聞電氣已可用作麻醉劑；此法之應用，係由兩位年靑的澳洲醫科生所發現。電氣麻醉法，已可施用於外科手術，實爲現代醫藥上的一種重要改革。</p>
<p>這兩位發明人，都是　爾缽大學（Melbourne　University）醫藥系三年級的學生，一位名羅斯（Mr．Samuel　Rose），一位名雷賓諾夫（Mr．Donald　rabinov），此二人都還不過是二十歲的靑年；他們研究所得的結果，遠較一九〇五年各界工作人士，研究所得的結果，更爲積極有效。</p>
<p>他們預期這新方法，將立刻產生作用，不致有任何事後反應，對於呼吸不生障礙，而對於心臟亦無顯著的影響。在畢爾缽大學曾做過許多次實臉，證明此種電氣麻醉，確可實際應用。據實驗者證明，毫無疑問，以適當的電力通過身體時，可使人類及動物沉隀長時間，且並無任何不適的感覺。</p>
<p>該項應用的儀器是由澳洲科學工業研究會（Australian　Couhcil　for　Scientific　and　Industrail　Research）所特別設計構造的，此一特殊設計物，其外形頗似一架無綫電收　機的配裝：體積很小，如遇緊急情形，需要應用時，可自由移動，並可應用於普通日用之電源。</p>
<p>此種電氣麻醉法，曾在日畢爾缽市立醫院（Melbourne　Public　Hospital），作學術上更進一步的試驗，結果獲得圓滿的成績。據當時該院路生試驗的報告，將電流通過病體時，病人即入睡眠狀態，當電流停止後，病者始漸蘇醒，事後亦無任何痛苦和影響。此次試驗用一二〇伏脫的電流，每秒鐘約通電一百次。</p>
<p>此方法的實施，在初始的階段，係將鼠類作爲驗試，每日均通電麻醉十分鐘，連續五大的工夫，到最後一次通電停止後，立即將該動物精密檢查，結果該動物未受絲毫影響；且於昔日所受各種訓練，仍能執行如常。</p>
<p>據兩位年靑的發明人，根據他們今年量後試驗的結果，正準備對此項研究的工作作更進一步的探討。學校當局亦已給與他們不少可貴的帮助。</p>
<p>畢爾缽大學的生理學敎授，雷德博士（Dr．R．D．Wright）的批評，對於神經病的治撩上及外科手術應用方面，電氣用作麻醉劑，是一種非常有價值的貢獻；電氣麻醉法，較一般應用的注射劑及嗅劑，更易於控制，此法能繼續作進一步的應用，則將可革除普遍一般實際應用的麻醉法。（譯自醫學世界月刋，The　MedicalWorld-Aug．1947　P．197“Electricityas　an　Anesthetic”）</p>

<h3>暗示篇</h3>
<p>— 史郁</p>
<p>一人在馬路上閒步，突然收住了脚步仰頭觀天。天上除白雲蒼狗，其實並無他物，但頃刻間，他的周圍便聚集了一羣人，也在那兒抬頭觀天；且頸子伸得比他更，也在那兒抬頭觀天；且頸子伸得比他更長，眼珠突得比他更出。　　再譬如說觀球賽。球員踢得愈緊張，球迷激動得愈忘形；當踢到所謂「千鈞一髮」的一刻，球迷可能從椅子上跳將起來，緊握了兩拳，完全是奔跑的姿態。有更多的人抖動難脚，作踢球狀。甚至有人用力的踢着前排的臀部，而不自覺。</p>
<p>商人或許可以說是世界上最懂得暗云的人了。美國的猶太商人自發明了分期付款的方法後，生意的興隆何止千倍。譬如說你要買一只電氣冰箱，一次拿出二百元美金，總有點肉痛，但一月拿出卅元錢，便覺得不在乎了。南京的糖果店老闆似乎懂得這種心理，將全部的糖果碼子由「斤」或「磅」改成「兩」。我去買花生米，他告訴我多少錢一兩，決不說多少錢一斤。九百元錢一兩，聽起來眞是便宜得很呢！　　心理學家告訴我們：我們日常的行動頗多是受人「暗示」的。即一顰一笑，也不能脫得這個道理。譬如說看好萊塢片：主角偶兒說了一句俏皮話，全院已笑聲四益。但你若問他們爲什麼笑，至少有一半的人會瞠目不知所答的。有些人看見人家笑得有趣而笑；有些人看見人家笑，自己不好意思不笑。西洋的這句名言：「你笑，世界會跟着你笑！」即含有「暗示」的眞實性。</p>
<p>所謂「暗示」即無形的給人家牽着鼻子的意思。有這樣的一個故事：說某宅失竊，但見一人狂呼提賊。大家東奔西走，結果並無所獲。其實那個狂呼提賊的朋友即是樑上君子。再譬如說你到大飯店去享口福：就算吃牛尾湯吧，假如侍者問你：「先生，要不要放雞蛋？」你若然節儉成風，自然可以不放；但假如侍者問你：「先生，雞蛋放一個還是放二個？」你就不好意思不放了！　　　　仔細想來，人生一世，無非是給人家牽着鼻子走，只是我們自己不覺得吧了。嬰孩時的你，奶媽牽着你的鼻子；童年的你，家庭牽着你的鼻子；年齡愈大，鼻着你的鼻子的愈多，範圍愈廣。你若活了三十歲，這意思是說你已給人家牽了三十年的鼻子。自然你是不會同意這一句話的，因爲以前你常常誤認自己是一個獨立的人。正與東施很少承認自已不漂亮一樣，天下偏少自命平凡的人。雖然事實告訴我們，我們的喜，怒，哀，樂，尤其是我們的人生觀與思想，完全是少數人牽鼻子的結果。少數人製造潮流（Curren），我們捲入潮流。二個時裝店老闆商議將女子旗袍的領子加高，未幾造成時尚，你就穿了高領的旗袍引以為榮，即使「高領」究全掩塞了你的嫵媚或美麗。美國男子服裝的式樣由Yale，Princeto等的大學的闊學生牽鼻；美國女子服裝的式樣由巴黎的時裝專家牽鼻。</p>
<p>你若讀了我這篇東西點頭，你即受了我的暗示；你若讀了我這篇東西搖頭，你也受了我的暗示。朋友，你懂得這個意思嗎？</p>
<h3>小具杯盤了寒夜</h3>
<p>— 廣覺</p>
<p>某人詩：「宵來有傳進，新買半床書」，又曰：「往時貧到一筆無，博進猶添半架書，今歲博徒洋懶近，故應書客亦全疎。」讀了久久歡喜，蓋戲賭嬴錢，是望外的事，而讀書人買幾本書，如今也算是豪舉，不可多得了，幾乎眞的只有在博進的時候，才能隨心的欲買它幾本。</p>
<p>兵法有云：「知己知彼，百戰百勝，」想想忒個殘忍。賭客每有好生之權，贏了很不舒服，再想想自己，輸錢也正可不必。於是，我忽然想在博中小休一下了。</p>
<p>夜生活過慣了，半夜回家，再也睡不着。天又冷，除了吃點酒，大槪更沒有別的好法子了。預先買好一點雞翅膀之類，驅車回家，路上看見有什麼還不曾撤去的攤頭，再添些腸子肚子，到得家裹，取出唯一囤貨上等高梁，還摸些蝦乾，乾菜，花生米等等，裝滿幾隻洋錢大小的碟子，就畢畢剝剝地自斟自酌起來了。孩子們的面孔，蘋果似的擱在枕上，他們不會酸轉來吵你；女人也已倦極，糊糊塗塗說一兩句話，早已呼呼入睡。於是攤一本書在手邊不經意地翻翻得句如「小具杯盤了寒夜」，雖非除夕，也在送歲，可作會心的微笑；瓶裏的臘梅，據靜發出一些幽香，更加使你覺得：一個人要時做神仙，倒眞也不難。</p>
<h3>舊詩今景</h3>
<p>— 董今狐</p>
<p>近時購得永新賀貽孫殘集，僅水田居文一卷有奇，詩三卷，雖缺頁頗多，亦有約五百首；賀爲明末詩文能手，惜其名為易堂九子所掩，世間遂少知者。不佞開來購書，類不甚選擇，讀書。亦隨喜，賀集係偶然間得之，其文章筆力近魏叔子，惟痛快則有過之無不及；詩不甚佳妙，然集中村謠，寫當時民間生活情形，讀之怦然心躍，蓋三百年前事，亦猶今日也。</p>
<p>村謠中第十八首云：</p>
<p>「役重儸愁有此身，今生髓竭莫辭貧，　兒權作斯須喜，明日朝餐省一人。」</p>
<p>末句似詼諧，但其哀痛實甚於長號泣血。</p>
<p>又其十四首云：</p>
<p>「官司雖苛怨無言，但怨先人舊業存，羨煞東家家破後，催租夜半不驚魂。」</p>
<p>此首雖嫌誇張，但胥吏擾民，則是實情，明淸之交如此，今日亦仍如昔。不佞籍　江南，薄有祖業，家人畏吏如盜，蓋產微不是應徵，家破則又不得活矣。</p>
<p>又村謠第八第九云：</p>

<h3>昆蟲玄秘</h3>
<p>— 銅駝</p>
<p>一位法國科學家有一次研究昆蟲的力量，發現一個甲蟲能够拖動四十倍於牠本身重量的東西，這就是說一隻甲蟲如其有一匹馬的大小，而其體力也是比例增大時，牠就能拖動十萬磅重的東西。</p>
<p>金字塔只有四百五十呎高，世界上最高的建築物是一千二百五十呎，即是比之六呎高的男人高出二百倍多一點，但菲洲白蟻的窠是一千倍高於造這窠的白蟻。</p>
<p>一隻小靑蠅的蛹蟲能够在四呎深的匣子裹跳出來，如其一個人也有這樣的跳躍本領，地能站在平地，不用以急衝開始，跳到八層樓高的屋頂上。跳蝨的本領更其大，能跳到二百倍於牠長度的遠處，這在人類可以跳到一千呎以外了。</p>
<p>設想有一個人坐下吃一餐豐盛的午餐！全雞，蔬菜，和「攀」，可使整個下午不餓了。但假使他有蜻蜓一樣的胃口，而體格大小的比例也相等的話，則吃下去這一點點東西，有如小小一碟點心，正是輕而易舉，毫不困難。曾經有人看見一隻蜻蜓在二小時內吃掉四十隻蒼蠅，雞與人之間的小大比例，芷與蒼蠅和普通蝟蜓一樣，然而人們吃雞，並不是連骨頭也吃下去的。</p>
<p>蜻蜓是世界上所有生物中胃口最大的一種昆蟲。蜻蜓只要經常有得吃，就能靜悄悄地站在一枚針上，毫無抵抗的樣子。一個研究自然科學的人竟然把蜻蜓自己的尾巴切下來，送到牠饑餓的口中！（譯者按：中國素有「蜻蜓吃尾巴」的成語，足以蹬明中外的蜻蜓，都是胃口好到極點，不惜以自己的尾巴來充飢的。）</p>
<p>「賀新郞」　百里　　梁任公爲文，動輒千言，滔滔不絕，其愛國思想，溢於言表，尤令人景仰不置，而其長短句不多見。茲讀其「賀新郞」一詞，直錚錚作響，詞云！「昨夜東風裹，忍回首，月明故國，凄凉到此！鶉首賜秦尋常夢，莫是鈞天沉醉，也不管，人間憔悴。落日長烟關塞黑，望陰山，鐵騎從橫地，漢　拔，鼓聲死！物華依舊山河異，是誰家，莊嚴臥楊，儘伊鼾睡！不信千年神明胄，事個更無男子。問春水，干卿何一？我自傷心人不見，訪明夷別有英雄淚。雞聲亂，劍光起。「民國八年春三月，四大名旦中尙小雲，在北平結婚，時樊樊山先生有「賀新郞」詞賀之云：「春社鴛鴦會。博金萱高堂一笑，　人成對。休當雌雄雙杏看，只算花論姊妹。品格是，金溫玉粹。北里羣芳知消息，笑鶴　難療靑梅味。無福者，莫相忌。金蓮　下春粧麗。待黃昏，親除翠鈿，替鬆珠佩；乍見生疏羞不語，嬌面端相仔細，料彼此魂銷心醉；柳黛雲　儂盡有，只弓彎　襪軟人意，須植出，五枝桂。」詞中如「休當雌雄雙杏看，只算花論姊妹……柳黛雲　儂盡有」等句，道人之所不能道，眞是妙絕人寰。若以之移贈他人，非唯不稱，且亦在「欠通一之例，此詞之所以爲佳。此兩詞一氣讀之，初則氣沖牛斗，終則似服一劑「淸凉散」焉。</p>
<h3>搶救丐童</h3>
<p>— 徐晋</p>
<p>冬令救濟最最重要的工作，要算「搶救丐童」了。活生生地着街頭的丐童們凍死，太殘忍了，太慘酷了，太不講人這了！老實說，這不是主辦冬令救濟者所可坐視的。</p>
<p>據茶夜報昨天（十七日）刋載：普善山莊同仁輔元堂兩日內收屍，計成人路屍十具，孩屍一百卅一具，就通常死亡率看來，這已是一個驚人的數字；而且從這裹面我們可以知道孩童對於寒冷的抵抗力遠不及成人，所以凍死的比成人多。正惟如此，我們應該趕先搶救丐童。　　兒童是民族的幼苗，是國家的元氣，做了乞丐的兒童並不例外，經過相當的敎育培養，一樣是國家民族的瓊寶。我敢說，搶救丐童，和搶救國家民族一樣重要。</p>
<p>快快搶救丐童！諸求主辦冬令救濟的先生們。</p>
<h3>逍遙花</h3>
<p>— 陳慎言</p>
<h3>第四章　兩心相印　（一八）</h3>
<p>綺紈說至此，不禁數息，又道：「我想盡法子，目前才有頭緒，因爲我的行頭太缺乏，在目下最省事，最能掙錢的，是演紡棉花，觀新噱頭，這一類戲，不但能呌座，且容易討好，又不須添什麼行頭，像最近董芝　，胡　春在外埠演紡棉花，買了幾所房子，大家都說紡棉花眞是發財還家。很有許多人勸我，不妨也學她們演紡棉花，改一改作風，又省事又可以掙錢，我父親大加反對，說允許我出來演戲，已是勉强，演梅派正路的本戲，還可以說得過去，若再演紡棉花這一類戲，更是笑話，不但沒辱身份，且與父親名譽攸關。你想我的環境如此，我家庭又如此主張，我的前途，不是很黯淡嗎？」綺紈說到這裘，聲音微帶些　動，似感受極度激刺。恰在這時，月亮又給一塊黑雲遮住，綺紈不期把一個身子，貼在渚齋身旁，又說道：「你看我該怎麼辦？」渚齋說道：「你別氣餒，事在人爲！」綺紈道：「我向來不肯把我的苦衷，告訴別人，爲的你誠實，才對你說，你勉勵我，我很感謝你，可是我怕辦不到。葉落歸根，一個人總有歸宿，我處在這種環境，不免灰心，再加外面對我家庭，有許多閑話，眞呌我爲難。」綺紈說到這裏，聲音又咽住，渚齋看他雙肩有些抽動，料她觸動心緒，哭了。一時也覺得難過，急要找手絹給她，一摸衣袋沒有，才記起剛才把手絹舖在石凳上，給她坐着。這時綺紈已取出自己手絹，在眼角上印一印，倚在渚齋身上，默然不語。渚齋想要安慰他，一時也難於措辭兩人靜默地坐着，而上天月亮，又由雲隙露出半而，渚齋在月光隱約之下，見綺紈雙眼，還帶淚痕，心想這個人是富於感情的，一個弱女子，能如此苦鬥，眞是難得，她外面歡樂，裹心却蘊着苦痛，一逢到熱情熨貼，她的眞情便激動起來。這時一陣秋風，瑟瑟吹過，月亮又隱去，渚齋情不自禁地把綺紈縱手一捏，覺得冰冷的，驚問道：「你冷吧？」綺紈把手微微一縮道：「不冷！我們走吧。」說着站起來，隨手把石凳上渚齋的手絹拾起，塞在自己皮夾內，另把自巳用的手絹，遞給渚齋道：「你那條手絹，給我坐過，怎好再拿出來擦臉，我這條你留下　。」</p>

<h3>金華豐氏慨助壹千萬元　盼貧苦產婦及早申請熱心善士多多捐輸</h3>
<p>「貧婦免費助產運動」，在十一月份一共帮助了二十五位窮苦的產婦，其中由人和醫院接生十三人，共計八，四八八，〇〇〇元；尚賢聲院七人，共計六，六四二，四〇〇元；保黎醫院五人，共計三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，三家醫院合計的接生費用，是一八，一三〇，四〇〇元，按照合約的規定，本報應該負担其中的一半，就是九，〇六五，二〇〇元，雖然九百多萬，並不是一個頂大的數字，但是由於近來捐款的銳减，和產婦入數的激增，使我們遭受到相當困難，但我們並不因此而氣餒，依然給予貧窮產妇以最大的援助。</p>
<p>金筆豐先生，從十月份起，就慨允負担本館對於「貧婦助產」應付的一切費用，此次應付的九百餘萬元，也裴金先生獨力承担了。這使我們獲得了堅强的支持，眞時也使一般貧婦，得到更大的安全的保陣。</p>

<h3>數字的「漲」「縮」</h3>
<p>— 淸雪</p>
<p>在這變態的經濟狀况下，向不輕易見於實用的數字，而今竟像流水帳一般，成爲「地道家常」，雖然刺戟神經，也頗富於研究的興味。一種是天文數字，一種是誇張歡字。</p>
<p>天文數字的特微，不在數目之繁，而在圈兒之數；例如太陽比地球大著一三〇〇〇〇〇倍，其「數」不過「一三」兩字，而「圈」則有五個之多。水星繞太陽軌道三六〇〇〇〇〇〇哩，數不過「三六」兩字，前圈則有六焉。地球之重（以噸計）數字不過「一六」，而圈則有二十六個，像火車頭帶着一大串的列車，又像一條鎖　，又像燈節跳舞的大籠燈。　　那樣的數字，從前在日常生活是用不着的。偶然見到者不過國家的大統計如調查戶口，迭報錢糧之類，至於普通交易，私人帳册，物品價格，決沒有如許多圈兒。但是，現在則不然了。　　昨在一家百貨店大玻璃窗，陳列許多呢帽，上層一美國新式者，標價是一個「2」領着六圈兒。（够江蘇全省的錢糧額數字了）。其餘一百餘萬，七八十萬，五六十萬不等，一「數」之下，都帶一趟「圈兒」。帽子如此，大衣，西服更不待言，無往而不大圈特圈，無往而非天文數字。</p>
<p>誇張數字，在舊時是虛設的，或泛指的，如「億兆京垓」，向來是存而不用。而現在則一個小機關經費，一個小建築開支，或小店舖小結帳，都是幾億幾億！</p>
<p>舊時的「億」，在殿試策及臣下恭祝皇帝運祚的頌聖用語，可以見到。如「我國家億萬年有道之長」，「大明（或大淸）億萬斯年」，那就是「萬歲，萬歲，萬萬歲」（西語所謂Long　live　the　king）。因爲「萬歲萬歲萬歲」太嚕囌，太俗，用在章奏或文章，不雅觀。所以用着閒冷古氣的一億」，旣加重頌，又顯得句法經濟。（與現代經濟專家主張發大鈔可以節約紙張字數的意思，可云所見略同。一笑。）　　事實上，一個朝代，那能「億萬斯年」？一個皇帝亦活不到那樣歲數。而皇帝自居「萬歲」而不疑，臣下尊崇「萬歲」亦像煞有介事。所以只好算是「誇張數字」。</p>
<p>可是，天文的」Astronomical數字，而今已習見於人事。誇張的Exaggerated數字，而今巳爲行市所常用。故曰，變態的經濟，能把冷宮裹東西變得熟熱鬧鬧，烈烈轟轟。</p>
<p>「一」，「十」，「百」，「千」，「萬」，「億」，「兆」，「京」，「垓」這些數字，大致設來，自「一」至「萬」一階段，是習熟的數字（實用的）；第二階段「億」至「核」，是生冷的數字。第二階段的前兩字，尚偶然用作特別的指數（億兆，兆庶，都可泛指無數民眾），而「京核」則地道冷宮裹東西了。第一階段的「千萬」的用處亦半實半虛，因爲千萬亦可泛指無限多數如「萬紫千紅」，「千門萬戶」等等，「百十」及其他小額字自然亦有活用，諸如「百年難過」，「十分相信」等等。　　各都市盛興之「百貨公司」，其「百貨」本意是表其「無所不備」，「多不可數」。然而我曾到某公司觀覽，只樓下一兩層的貨色，就不只「百」樣。誇張標榜的數字，倒比實數少了。　　「兆」比「億」大，應當比「億」更冷，但除「億兆」「兆庶」古典語詞之外，其在近代見於實指之用，倒比「億」字早一步。</p>
<p>那就是庚子賠款「四百五十兆兩」，甲午賠款「二百三十兆兩」，在中國文書及奏報雖是「四萬萬五千萬」，「二萬三千萬」，在西文則無」萬」而有「兆」（几國際條約，例以本國文及西文雙繕，且多以法文爲憑）。</p>
<p>西文數字「一」，「十」，「百」，「千」與中國同，而「萬」則根本無此數，到了「萬」只說「十千」（The　Thousand）。「四萬萬五千萬」在西文如說「若干千千」便細瑣不堪了，所以他們是說「四百五十兆」four　hundred　and　fifty　mililon。這Million是「百萬」，恰合於中國之「兆」，於是中國報章及雜誌亦說「四百五十兆」。後來連「四萬萬同胞」亦說「四百兆同胞」，故「兆」比「億」先見於實用之故，不在華而在「洋」。　　用大額字比較經濟，而且淸楚。即如「四萬萬五千萬」，可用加號「十」（四萬萬之外又五千萬也），四萬五千萬又可用乘號（X）（四萬五千倍的萬也），數多則混目矣。用「兆」則無此處。</p>
<p>現在之「億」亦然。一汽車或一房標價兩萬萬五千萬，亦像兩萬萬加五千萬，亦像是兩萬萬個五千萬，亦像是兩萬萬五千個萬。不如說「兩億五千萬」，再簡約一下子，則「兩億半」亦行了。　　中西數字，同字異解，有無端巧合者。　「兆」在華文，以實數曾則爲由「一，十，百，千，萬，億」而進之倍數。以泛稱言，則「兆庶」「億兆」即指無數大多之民衆（如「兆庶騰歡」即「萬民康樂」；「撫臨億兆」即「治理萬民」）。西文之Million亦然。以實數言為Ten　hundrenthousand，而亦指The　mass　of　common　people，即「洮庶」「億兆」「兆民」也。　中國之「億兆京垓」有「十倍進一」，「萬倍進一」之兩解。前者循「一至萬」之倍數，每進以十倍，故「十萬爲億，十億爲兆，十兆爲京，十京爲垓」，是曰「小數系」；「四萬萬同胞」稱「四百兆」，即是如此解法。如照現在之「億」字解說，以「四萬萬」稱「四億」，則只有「四十萬！」差得多了。後者自「萬」起，變「十億進」而爲「萬倍進」，放「萬萬爲億」，「萬億爲兆」，「萬兆爲京」，「萬京爲垓」，這是現在所用之「億」，「大數系」。</p>
<p>西人之Billion亦有兩解，美法以由「千」而千倍之（a　thousand　thousand爲a　million；a　thousand　ｍillion爲a　billion）；而英國則由「兆」而兆倍之，（a　million　million爲a　billion），故至數至極大，則倍數每歧，正不獨中國之「十倍萬的億」與「萬億萬的億」爲然。</p>

<h3>Chairman's Instructions on Financial Plan: Economic Pacification More Important Than Military; Four Joint Council Decides to Continue Loan Suspension</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The chairman of the Four Joint Treasury Supervisory Council is concurrently held by the Chairman of the National Government. As this year's end approaches, Chairman Chiang specially convened a meeting of all council members at the National Government at 10:00 AM on the 18th to review past work. At the meeting, the Chairman gave important instructions on the current economic, financial, and loan issues. Firstly, regarding the general economic situation, he instructed: "Currently, economic pacification is actually more important than military pacification. Therefore, we must regulate the economy through finance and lead the national economy. If financial control is well-managed, our self-reliance will be no problem." Secondly, he gave the following four instructions on loan policies: (A) The four banks' lending in the coming year will continue to adopt a tight policy. (B) All necessary loans should especially focus on absorbing floating capital in the market. (The Chairman pointed out the floating capital of commercial banks when explaining this point). (C) The loan plan and budget for the coming year need to be jointly drafted by the Ministry of Finance and the Four Joint Treasury Supervisory Council and submitted to the Chairman for approval. (D) Use political power to stabilize fluctuations in the financial market, including cracking down on the financial black market. Around 11:00 AM, the Chairman left early to preside over Zhang Ji's funeral and was replaced by Vice Chairman Zhang to preside over the meeting. Then, Xu Baiyuan, Secretary-General of the Four Joint Treasury Supervisory Council, reported on the loan business of the past year in great detail. The attending council members then expressed their opinions on the Chairman's instructions. The meeting ended at around 12:00 PM. The meeting also passed the revised draft of measures to strengthen the regulation of financial business submitted by the Executive Yuan. In addition, the heads of relevant agencies and the heads of various banks were designated to hold a review meeting in the afternoon to discuss future directions. The review meeting was held at the Bank of Communications at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. From 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, the meeting resumed in the conference room of the Executive Yuan to continue discussions. After 8:00 PM, the Chairman invited the attendees to a dinner at his official residence and exchanged opinions. The meeting ended late at night. As for the important decisions made at the meeting, the participants refused to disclose them, only stating that it was a comprehensive review of finance. [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The loan issue of national banks and bureaus is being closely watched by all parties. Chairman Chiang also expressed great concern about this, hence the move to personally preside over the Four Joint Treasury Supervisory Council. According to relevant sources, the loan suspension will remain temporarily until prices stabilize, and then discussions will be held. However, some new national construction and daily necessities, as well as export materials for foreign exchange, will be reopened. The detailed measures are still being studied by the parties concerned.</p>

The remnants of the independent brigade of the Communist Taihang Military Region fled to Yanmazhuang, northeast of the county. [Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 18th Dispatch] The tense situation in Zhengzhou has passed. Chen Yi's bandit vanguard retreated to Weishi, and his follow-up troops were also defeated by the National Army in Tongxu and East Bian. Chen Geng's main force is still in the area south of Yongning, and the situation in Xuchang is unknown. A group of Liu's bandits attacked the Xinyang-Huangchuan Highway, and the main force of the northward fleeing troops is still in the Xuanhuadian area. [Our Newspaper, Kaifeng, 17th Dispatch] Chen Yi's 11th Column, which attacked Lanfeng, has now fled to Wangtun, outside the East City Wall of Kaifeng. The defending troops are fighting fiercely against them in the severe cold. The bandit's 1st Column has fled to Baimugang, more than ten miles south of Kaifeng, and its headquarters has occupied Zhuxian Town. Hundreds of thousands of citizens in Kaifeng are now cooperating with the defending troops with enthusiastic emotions to strengthen the city's defenses. They are all automatically comforting the defending troops. Hundreds of students from Henan University have requested to join the Kaifeng Defense War. [Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 18th Dispatch] On the 18th, the Kaifeng National Army continued its full-scale offensive, sweeping in three directions: southeast, southwest, and south. The scattered bandits lingering on the periphery of Kaifeng were defeated at the sight of the wind. Currently, there are no bandits within 20 miles around Kaifeng. In addition, more than 10,000 bandits who fled to Zhuxian Town fled to the southeast and south of Zhi on the evening of the 17th. The bandits on the Lanfeng side also fled mostly to the northeast and east. The National Army advancing from the east of Kaifeng has driven out the communist bandits between Xinglong and Luowang and is advancing towards Lanfeng. They will be able to join forces within days, and there are no communist bandits between Bian and Zheng. Many cavalry from Zhengzhou arrived in Bian safely today. [Our Newspaper, Hankou, 18th Dispatch] Military News: The main force of Liu's 1st Column crossed the Yellow River from Dabukou on the 17th. Currently, there are no bandits north of the Xinyang-Huangchuan Highway, south of the Huai River, and west of the Huang River. The main force of the 6th Bandit Column fled north across the Huangchuan-Gushi Highway from the Yagang-Zhupidian area southeast of Huangchuan on the 17th. The National Army is pursuing and suppressing them near Baisudian. After the remnants of the 12th Bandit Column were defeated by the National Army, a remnant force joined Zhang Jian's bandit force and crossed the Fu River from Pinglin (northwest of Anlu) and fled to the Luoyangdian Weishan area south of Suixian on the morning of the 17th. [Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 18th Dispatch] The communist bandit Wei Fenglou's troops, who invaded Yutai, were forced to retreat northward under the pressure of powerful troops, suffering heavy losses. The evacuated government personnel in Yutai have returned to the city. The middle reaches of the Huai River are peaceful, and traffic is normal. [Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 18th Dispatch] The Northeast Communist Bandits' Seventh Offensive began on the 12th, destroying the Daling River Bridge on the Beining Railway, with Shenyang as the target. They adopted a strategy of infiltration and drilling gaps, seeking the core, and advancing through gaps in the north, west, and east. The northern route consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, and 10th Columns. The 6th Division of their 2nd Column was head-on attacked by the National Army in the area of Sanjiazhi, Shahousuo, 15 kilometers southwest of Faku, at 2:00 PM on the 17th and began to collapse. 5,000 to 6,000 people were captured. The National Army is forcing a general sweep and advanced to Tongjiangkou that night. The bandits suffered extremely heavy blows. The western bandits, the 9th Column, are between Heishan and Xinlitun, with only a small part reaching the Huanliu River East and Longdian area, and have not dared to take any offensive action. The southern bandits are now divided into two groups and are heading towards the outer strongholds of Shenyang. One group is approaching the Xiaotun Cement Plant along the railway, threatening Liaoyang to the west. The other group is pressing Sujiatun westward along the Shenyang-Anshan Railway from Benxi. Shiqiaozhi and Waitoushan Station, northwest of Benxi, were occupied on the 17th, and their vanguard advanced to the vicinity of Yaoqianhutun, which is closer to Sujiatun. Sujiatun is a major stronghold on the south bank of the Hun River in southern Shenyang. The National Army is head-on attacking them. Another group is causing disturbances near the Yantai Coal Mine between Sujiatun and Liaoyang. The Changchun Railway train was still able to reach Tanggangzi south of Anshan on the 18th. The National Army is opening its mouth to let the bandits drill in and has begun the "eating" tactic. Shahousuo on the northern route is the first bite to swallow and will continue to swallow. The bandits are already worried about this. According to military agencies, the bandits' attempt to dig out the heart has failed, and the next step may be to adopt an encirclement policy. However, after the bandit main force is defeated, the National Army can expand even more. The authorities expressed that they have a very effective way to deal with this offensive and said that the outcome can be determined in two weeks. [Central News Agency, Shenyang, 18th Dispatch] The Liaonan bandit army began to cause disturbances: The 4th Division of the 8th Bandit Column invaded Ximucheng (southeast of Haicheng) on the 16th. The backbone regiment of the 3rd Military Sub-district of the bandits sneaked into the Gaojiawaizi military station (northeast of Benxi) on the evening of the 17th.</p>

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th Dispatch] The newly appointed Capital Garrison Commander Sun Lianzhong met with reporters from this newspaper at his private residence today and said that the official order for his new position has not yet arrived in Ping. He has been busy holding meetings in recent days to close the "stalls" of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters and the Hebei Provincial Government. Once everything is in order, he will go to Nanjing to take office. He claimed that he is not used to life in big cities and would still like to visit the defense areas under his jurisdiction after taking office in Nanjing, rather than spending his days socializing. Sun was wearing a loose-fitting robe and looked relaxed when he met with reporters. This afternoon at 5:00 PM, Fu Zuoyi visited Sun to discuss issues such as personnel arrangements after the closure of the Pacification Headquarters.</p>
<p>Minister Bai Goes to Hunan [Our Newspaper, Changsha, 18th Dispatch] Bai Chongxi arrived in Hunan on the 18th by special train on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway.

<p>Foreign Minister Wang Meets with the Minister to Conduct a Profound Review of the Overall Situation; Hopes for Support of Our Position on the Japanese Peace Conference [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang met with Ambassador Stuart at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 5:45 PM on the 18th and had an important talk lasting one and a half hours, with a detailed and profound review of the world, the Far East, and Sino-U.S. relations. According to people in the know, U.S. policy towards China will have new developments, and future assistance will inevitably be strengthened. The person also analyzed the consequences of the breakdown of the London Four Foreign Ministers Conference, which has made the world's confrontation clearer and more tense. After Marshall's unpleasant departure from the Foreign Ministers Conference, he discussed the merger of the British, American, and French occupation zones in western Germany with Bevin and Bidault, declaring the German peace conference hopeless. The path for the United States and the Soviet Union to seek cooperation in Europe has been cut off, and the Elbe River has finally become a crack in the earth. If no other way can be found to break the deadlock in the future, the world will inevitably be driven to war. Marshall also plans to rush back to the United States, symbolizing that the U.S. diplomatic policy urgently needs to be reviewed and rapidly revised to cope with the subsequent situation and possible accidents. Marshall may still have some hope for the Japanese peace conference, or even regard it as a last resort, starting from the Far East to solve the stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union, but it is not known how effective this move will be. However, no matter what, the U.S. position in the Far East urgently needs to be strengthened, there is no doubt about that. Foreign Minister Wang may have proposed to the minister on the 18th to support China's position, because the Chinese government has not yet abandoned its advocacy of the Japanese peace conference and has long publicly stated that the Far East issue is simpler than the European issue. The satisfactory signing of the Japanese peace treaty can promote the opening of the U.S.-Soviet stalemate. However, if the Japanese peace conference continues to be deadlocked due to procedural discrimination, China has no other way but to strengthen its own strength. The news that the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communist Party signed a military agreement has received high attention from political figures in Beijing. This news may not be groundless. The action of the United States to aid China really cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, Foreign Minister Wang's meeting with the minister is the most important thing. Sino-U.S. relations will inevitably have new developments in the chaotic world situation.</p>

<p>U.S. State Department Considers Special Aid to China Plan; to be Submitted to Congress Early Next Year [U.S. Information Service, Washington, 17th Dispatch] A State Department spokesman today supported the government's policy of aid to China, assuring the Senate Appropriations Committee that, in addition to the current European recovery plan, the government will submit a specific plan for aid to China to Congress early next year. Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Thorp told the committee that the United States has provided more than one billion U.S. dollars to China since the victory over Japan and that more will be needed in the future. He said that the State Department has been considering the situation in China since China was included in the congressional-approved temporary aid bill to France, Italy, and Austria. Zipp said that the temporary relief plan for China could include obtaining wheat, kerosene, rice, medicines, and other items, but he believes that certain special needs for relief in Europe may be limited due to the funds allocated to China. [United Press, Washington, 17th Dispatch] Thorp and the Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Division of the State Department, former Minister Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in China, Bedell Smith, both attended the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 17th to express their views and avoided answering questions from congressmen about whether the Soviet Union was assisting the Chinese Communist Party. Thorp declared that the amount of U.S. aid to China after the war has exceeded one billion yuan, including UNRRA relief, Lend-Lease, and surplus materials. The State Department is now drafting a special aid to China bill, which will be submitted to Congress after January next year. The 27.7 million yuan aid bill passed by the previous session of Congress is also being implemented. Committee Chairman Bridges questioned the State Department on the spot, asking why China was not included in the assistance to various countries to resist communism. Thorp replied that he did not know. He only said that the aid to China bill is currently being drafted, and this bill is limited to emergency relief to European countries. Judge Yide also asked about the supply of weapons to the Chinese government army. Bedell Smith replied that this matter is underway, and the air force equipment is also included. In addition to the recent signing of an agreement to supply China with air force equipment, the State Department will also approve the shipment of weapons and ammunition to China. [United Press, Washington, 17th Dispatch] Thorp provided the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee on the 17th with a preliminary plan for temporary aid to China, preparing to authorize the use of 60 million U.S. dollars for China in the relief bill after the final allocation is designated by Congress. He said that the funds may be used for the following purposes: The distribution of rice, which will be similar to the Italian relief bill, with approximately 24 million U.S. dollars used for this purpose. Approximately 18 million U.S. dollars will be used to supply 38 million barrels of oil and petroleum products. The remaining funds after offsetting the income and expenditure of this plan will be used to purchase more rice or cotton. This is the first time that the State Department has revealed the content of the aid to China plan after the aid to China fund is approved. (The response of the Beijing political circles to Wedemeyer's strong promotion of aid to China is published in the left corner of page 2)</p>
<p>Bullitt and Judd Strongly Advocate Economic and Military Aid to China; Current War in China is the Prelude to the Third World War [Associated Press, Washington, 17th Dispatch] Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bullitt declared to the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 17th that aid to China should precede aid to France, Italy, and Austria. The government is now arming the enemy, while Congress refuses to arm its allies. The State Department has ample time to allocate relief plans and promised to submit them to Congress after January next year. Unfortunately, the State Department's policy completely misunderstood that the Soviet Union is a peace-loving country and that the Chinese Communist Party is only an agrarian reformist and has nothing to do with Moscow. Although it is fortunate to realize it now, the time between thought and design has been long. A part of the Senate asked whether Mr. Bullitt believed that the State Department was hindering the discussion of further aid to China. He did not answer directly, only saying that Ambassador Stuart repeatedly sent urgent telegrams requesting increased aid, but he did not receive a polite reply. This matter is well known in Washington and elsewhere. Committee Chairman Bridges asked again whether the U.S. representatives in China were competent. Mr. Bullitt replied that we urgently need first-class talents to handle all U.S. benefits in China. Since military affairs are paramount, the United States must send Meng Shuai to China. If MacArthur cannot go, then a general with the most experience in dealing with the Communist Party should be sent instead, such as General Clark. Mr. Bullitt also said that the United States supplied China with weapons and ammunition during the war, but from May 1946 to May 1947, it banned exports to China. Since then, China has never obtained a box of ammunition to replenish American-made rifles, or a shell to replenish American-made cannons. The Chinese government army is confronting well-equipped communist troops, and at least part of the communist troops' equipment comes from Soviet-seized factories in the Northeast. At the same time, Congressman Judd declared that aid to China is the best way to avoid the Third World War with the Soviet Union and its vassals. We do not need to include China in the emergency foreign aid funds currently being discussed, but at least 60 million U.S. dollars should be reserved for early aid to China. The current war in China is not a civil war, but the first small contact of the Third World War. It is necessary to keep the Chinese government strong and help it defeat communism. When the Japanese army in the Northeast surrendered, the Soviet Union seized Japanese weapons and supplies and left them for the communist army to occupy. Unless the central government gains the moral, economic, and military support of the United States, it will inevitably collapse, and the communist production of justice to rule Asia is like a prairie fire. China is one of the world's major countries, and it is very dangerous if it is controlled by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>U.S. House of Representatives Passes Deletion of China Section of Foreign Aid Bill; Bill Sent to Senate for Discussion [Associated Press, Washington, 17th Dispatch] The House of Representatives passed the Appropriations Committee's recommendation on the 17th by voice vote, reducing 88 million U.S. dollars from the 597 million U.S. dollars in the foreign aid bill and deleting the China relief section. The bill is now sent to the Senate for discussion, and the Senate may restore the original bill and include the China section. On the same day, President Truman also signed the 597 million U.S. dollar aid bill for China, France, Italy, and Austria. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges, upon hearing the results of the House vote, said that he would convene the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 18th to hold a vote and said: "I personally hope to include the China section, but it is difficult to say how the committee will vote." He said: "China has become an orphan under consideration by the United States and should be given preferential treatment in preventing dictatorship and the spread of communism throughout the world." He hopes that the Senate Appropriations Committee can submit the bill to the Senate for a vote by noon on Friday.</p>
<p>Canada Sells Us Arms; Second Batch Shipped to China [Associated Press, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, 18th Dispatch] Port authorities announced that more than 15 million rounds of small arms ammunition and hundreds of tons of air force ground equipment, worth 1.2 million U.S. dollars, are scheduled to be loaded onto the "Corima" ship on the 18th and will sail to Wusong, China on the 19th for use by the Chinese army. Government officials in Ottawa stated that this is part of the 10.5 million U.S. dollar Mosquito aircraft recently purchased by China from Canada, and it is entirely an economic matter and has no political motives. According to the agreement between the two parties, Canada will ship the remaining 170 surplus aircraft, along with guns, ammunition, and ground equipment. This is the second delivery, and the first one was shipped from Montreal a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Sui High Court is Planning to Set Up an Extra-Mural Prison in Hetao [Central News Agency, Guihua, 18th Dispatch] Sui High Court President Yu Cunhao reported in the Sui Provincial Assembly yesterday that the situation in Hetao Yimeng is most suitable for setting up an extra-mural prison, and the conditions are quite complete. The Sui High Court has always paid attention to extra-mural operations for prisoners, using it as an implementation experiment, and has achieved great results. After the restoration, more prisoners with labor force were selected to organize extra-mural work teams to conduct further experiments, which have been even more effective. Because the construction equipment and administrative expenses of the extra-mural prison require a large amount of funds, the local area is really unable to organize it. Therefore, at the National Judicial Administration Review Conference this year, the Sui High Court proposed the establishment of an extra-mural prison in Hetao as the central proposal, which was approved by the conference and sent to the Ministry for handling. A specific plan is now being planned and is expected to be prepared in 1948 after approval.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Analysis of the US Aid to China Problem</h3>
<p>After heated discussions in both the US Senate and House of Representatives, the US Emergency Aid Act was finally agreed upon, and aid to China was still included in the bill. Although opinions on aid to China varied greatly within the US government and public, after a month of discussion in both houses, opinions can be said to have become consistent. Moreover, this bill has already been signed into law by President Truman, and aid to Europe and aid to China are considered equally important, with no distinction made between them. Logically, there should be no more problems. Unexpectedly, another snag arose, with the House Appropriations Committee actually proposing to cut the foreign aid fund by $88 million, including $60 million for China. When we heard this news the day before yesterday, we did not pay much attention to the Appropriations Committee's obstruction and believed that this proposal would definitely be rejected by the House of Representatives. However, according to a dispatch from the United Press in Washington on the 17th, the House of Representatives has passed the Appropriations Committee's cut and has sent it to the Senate for discussion. The House of Representatives' inconsistency is truly perplexing. The US aid to China problem can be described as full of twists and turns, leaving those of us who are most concerned about the US political situation feeling lost in a fog.</p>
<p>President Truman convened Congress this time primarily for the emergency aid to Europe issue. Even in President Truman's message to Congress, there was not a word about aid to China. However, Republican leaders and members of Congress who generally sympathize with China expressed dissatisfaction that President Truman's emergency foreign aid plan did not include China, and criticized President Truman for prioritizing Europe over Asia. The House Foreign Affairs Committee first proposed that the US should allocate $60 million to aid China within the foreign aid fund. Through the efforts of Congressman Judd, the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed it. At the same time, twelve American diplomats jointly appealed to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for military and economic assistance to China. The American media also unanimously advocated that the US should immediately provide comprehensive assistance to China. However, the Senate passed a $59.7 million aid to Europe bill on December 1st without making any major revisions. Therefore, there were two foreign aid bills in the US Congress: one was the foreign aid bill proposed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which included $60 million in aid to China, and was later passed by the House of Representatives on the 10th; the other was the emergency foreign aid bill passed by the Senate, which was similar to that proposed by President Truman and did not include China in the bill. According to American political practice, when the Senate and House of Representatives disagree on a certain bill, a joint conference of the Senate and House of Representatives must be held to negotiate a compromise bill. The first joint conference was held on the 12th of this month, but no agreement was reached due to differing opinions. However, a compromise was finally reached: China was listed as one of the four recipient countries in the emergency foreign aid bill; the total amount of the foreign aid fund remained $59.7 million; the amounts to be received by China, France, Italy, and Austria were not specified, but were to be determined by the Appropriations Committee. As a result, this compromise bill was passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives on the 15th.</p>
<p>We studied this compromise bill. On the surface, China has been listed as one of the four recipient countries, but in reality, it may not receive any assistance. Because there is an attached condition in this compromise bill: "Any funds reserved for aid to China may be used to aid the other three countries." Therefore, when China will receive emergency aid from the US depends on when the State Department submits its specific aid to China plan. From this, it can be said that the House Appropriations Committee's proposal to cut aid to China is no accident. Moreover, some people say that the emergency foreign aid bill cannot be viewed solely from the perspective of international politics, but also needs to take into account the US domestic economic situation, and should be jointly decided by the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Appropriations Committee. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Appropriations Committee's proposal is based on a narrow American economic perspective. However, the House of Representatives' inconsistency is the strangest thing in the world! After passing the House of Representatives, the cut is now submitted to the Senate for discussion. Yesterday, the Associated Press and United Press reports on the question of whether the US will aid China were overwhelming, some repeating each other, and some contradicting each other, extremely complex. We summarized them into the following points: The House of Representatives has passed the cut proposed by the Appropriations Committee; General Wedemeyer, who attacked the Chinese government for "corruption and incompetence," appealed to the Senate Appropriations Committee, arguing that the US should provide economic and military assistance to China, and praised President Chiang's leadership of the Chinese military and people in the war of resistance against Japan; State Department Assistant Thorpe announced that the State Department has drafted a long-term aid to China plan, which will be implemented as soon as funding is available, and said that the US supply of food and kerosene to China is also part of the US aid to China plan; Liddell, the original author of the "Visit China" article that caused a sensation in the world, spoke again at a committee in the Senate, reiterating that the US should send MacArthur to China, and if MacArthur cannot spare the time, then General Clark should be sent to China.</p>
<p>From these reports, we can see the chaos in the United States. Not only is the US government hesitant about China, but opinions in the media are still divided. Perhaps this chaotic phenomenon is the characteristic of American democracy, but we must point out that the US government and public still do not have a correct understanding of the current situation in the Far East and the political situation in China. The average American not only does not know what the Chinese Communist Party is, but also does not know how to raise their vigilance against the establishment of the Far Eastern Communist International in order to prevent problems before they arise. To be honest, international relations have developed to the current stage, and world peace is already indivisible. After World War I, there were still so-called isolationists in the US. Later, facts proved that even if the US wanted to stay out of it, it was impossible. Therefore, after World War II, isolationists had long disappeared, but the concept of "Europe First" was still deeply rooted and unbreakable. If the US government's foreign policy does not break through this stale old concept, it will inevitably lead to unpredictable disasters in the future. The US should attach equal importance to Europe and Asia, and especially should actively aid China. We do not want to waste any more words, but hope that the US government and public will quickly make wise decisions regarding the current world situation, and should pay attention to the unity of foreign policy. This ambiguous and contradictory attitude is harmful to both world peace and the interests of the US itself.</p>
<h3>Opinions on Increasing Paper Production</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) The planned paper production for the next year is 112,320 tons of paper, 73,500 tons of cardboard, and 180 tons of cigarette paper, which is an increase of 46,223 tons of paper, 21,655 tons of cardboard, and 90 tons of cigarette paper compared to this year's production. In order to achieve the above needs, the quantity of imported wood pulp is as follows: A. For factories manufacturing adhesive paper, based on 42% supply of wood pulp, 41,715 tons are needed. B. For cardboard factories, based on 10% supply of wood pulp, 6,750 tons are needed. C. For cigarette paper factories, based on 10% supply of wood pulp, 18 tons are needed, totaling 48,483 tons of wood pulp. The amount of newspaper production increase in the next year is as follows: (Each factory converts 50% of the increased production into newspaper paper) A. Thin paper factories can produce 24,612 tons of newspaper paper. B. Cardboard factories can produce 10,828 tons of newspaper paper. C. Cigarette paper factories can produce 45 tons of newspaper paper, totaling 35,485 tons. Regarding self-made pulp, A. The Tainan Paper Mill of the National Resources Commission should find ways to increase production, and be able to reach a daily output of 60 tons after four months. B. The Zhongyuan Paper Mill has already imported six mechanical pulp tanks. Except for one that has been shipped to Sichuan, the remaining five should be assisted in establishing a mechanical pulp mill in Taiwan, with a daily output of 50 tons. C. The equipment of the China Paper Mill should be supplemented and its expansion should be assisted, so that the production site can be increased from 10 tons to 50 tons per day. D. Assist private paper mills in various regions to cooperate in setting up chemical wood pulp machinery, wood pulp and grass pulp factories in various regions. The above projects will be completed within three to four years. Regarding materials; A. Copper wire mesh, each ton of thin paper consumes 2 square feet of copper wire, each ton of cardboard consumes 0.25 square feet of copper wire mesh, and each ton of cigarette paper consumes 4 square feet of copper wire mesh. B. Blankets, each ton of thin paper uses 1.3 pounds of grade A blankets, each ton of cardboard uses 1.2 pounds of secondary blankets, and each ton of cigarette paper uses 1.73 pounds of blankets. C. Canvas, each ton of thin paper uses 1 pound of canvas. These materials, together with the coal, bleaching powder, sulfur, etc. required for papermaking, should be jointly organized by state-owned and private paper mills into a papermaking materials supply committee, which will be responsible for the overall distribution. For those that must be imported, the import quantity for each quarter should be agreed upon with the Import and Export Management Committee to avoid shortages. Next year, the import of wood-free paper, glazed paper, packaging paper, cardboard, etc., except for cellophane, drawing paper, and model cardboard (approximately US$2 million), will be completely prohibited. The import volume of cigarette paper should be reduced from 600,000 reams to 390,000 reams. The amount of newspaper imports should be reduced from 50,000 tons to 15,000 tons. The amount of wood pulp imports should be increased from 12,000 tons to 48,483 tons. The required foreign exchange is A. Newspaper 15,000 tons, estimated at US$167 per ton, totaling US$2.50 million. B. Cigarette paper 390,000 reams, US$5 per ream, totaling US$1.95 million. C. Wood pulp 48,483 tons, US$200 per ton, totaling US$9.696.6-00 million, for a total of US$14.146,1600 million, a decrease of approximately US$4 million compared to this year's imports. Although paper production has increased by more than 50,000 tons, the supply and demand situation for newspapers can barely be met, cardboard can also be self-sufficient, but other types of paper are still insufficient, and efforts should be made to conserve consumption to match supply and demand. The distribution price of newspapers is very different from the market price and adjustments should be made to make it reasonable.</p>

<h3>Three War Criminals, Including the Devil Who Killed People, Tried in One Court and Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Noda Tsuyoshi and Mukai Toshiaki, the two war criminals who participated in the Nanjing Massacre's killing contest, and Tanaka Gunkichi, who killed 300 people, have been sentenced to death. The Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense held a public trial of the case today in the auditorium of the Lizhi Society, presided over by Shi Meiyu. After the three criminals were brought to court, they were asked to state their age and origin. Prosecutor Li Xuan then presented the main points of the indictment and began individual investigations. First, Tanaka was questioned. According to his confession, he was under the command of Tani Hisao and participated in the attack on Nanjing in December 1937. The court presented the criminal with a wooden figure of Tanaka killing my civilians and a photo of his military sword, which he used to kill more than 300 people. Tanaka admitted that he "did use this sword to fight," but cunningly claimed that the killing photo was taken during combat in Tongcheng, Hubei, when he was ordered to kill a person who had been executed. The presiding judge then presented the book "Imperial Soldiers" written by Japanese officer Yamanaka Taro, which contained text and photos of Tanaka using this precious sword to slaughter more than 300 people. When the criminal saw this evidence, he again evaded responsibility, claiming that the author had fabricated it to show the special bravery of the imperial army. Subsequently, Mukai and Noda were questioned. According to telegrams sent by enemy war correspondents Asami Hikari and Asami Suzuki, which were continuously published in Tokyo newspapers, the two criminals participated in a killing contest during the Nanjing siege on December 12, 1937, racing to create a record of 150 kills in Zijinshan. As a result, Mukai killed 106 people and Noda killed 105 people, as verified by the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun. The book "The Nanjing Massacre" written by British journalist Timperley also contains the same record, which can be used as corroborating evidence. However, the two war criminals falsely claimed that the news reporters had fabricated the story. Mukai said that when he met a news reporter after fighting in Wuxi, he jokingly said that the reporter had fabricated this heroic deed to exaggerate his martial prowess and encourage public morale. The debate then began, and all were refuted one by one in court. After deliberation by the five judges, the court continued to convene, and the presiding judge first rejected the requests from the criminals to continue investigating the evidence, and then announced the following main text of the judgment in court: "[Tanaka Gunkichi, Noda Tsuyoshi, and Mukai Toshiaki, during the war, continuously slaughtered prisoners and non-combatants, and are each sentenced to death." The presiding judge explained the main points of the reasons for the judgment. Tani Hisao invaded Nanjing in December 1937 and carried out a massacre, which was a major stain on the history of world civilization. China suffered 300,000 casualties. The judgment of the case has been recognized by the world as their crime. All of Tani Hisao's subordinates who participated in the massacre are accomplices, unless they can provide special evidence to the contrary. Not only could the three criminals not provide evidence to the contrary, but there was conclusive evidence proving their participation. Tanaka admitted to being a subordinate of Tani and recognized the precious sword as his own. Noda and Mukai admitted to belonging to Nakajima's unit, which was also attacking Nanjing. The evidence of each crime is conclusive, and the judgment is based on the law as above. However, the judgment must be submitted to our Supreme Commander for approval. If the defendants are not satisfied, they may submit a statement of defense within ten days after receiving the judgment. After the translator finished, the presiding judge announced the adjournment of the court at 2:30 p.m., and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>New Method for Treating Glaucoma: Poison Gas Can Be Used as a Special Drug</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] China Natural Science Society News: Glaucoma is one of the most dangerous diseases of the eye. Patients can lose their sight in a short period of time.

<h3>Wedemeyer Strongly Urges Aid to China, Political Circles in Nanjing Attach Great Importance, Believing That the Outline of His Secret Recommendations Can Be Seen</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 18th] Wedemeyer strongly argued for the necessity of aiding China in the Appropriations Committee of the Senate in Washington. The National Government here believes that this is the most exciting development in American aid since the victory. The basis of the government's attitude is that Wedemeyer's views expressed in the Senate Committee are undoubtedly the same as the recommendations in his secret report, and Wedemeyer's report has a decisive influence on the formation of the State Department's China policy.</p>
<p>On the day of his departure from China, Wedemeyer issued a statement severely criticizing the Chinese government, and several senior officials of the Chinese government refuted his inadequate observations. Wedemeyer's remarks in the Senate Committee, for the first time, revealed his views on China's policy, and some aspects were surprisingly lenient. Unofficial news reports once claimed that Truman and Marshall had approved Wedemeyer's report on aid to China, but before finding a good strategy for proposing the aid plan, Wedemeyer's report was shelved and not made public. Now, this news seems quite reasonable. It is believed here that the reason why the US government has been slow to publish the report is to first resolve the urgent European recovery plan and the London Foreign Ministers Conference.</p>
<p>Well-informed sources believe that the State Department has another factor in not immediately publishing the report. It is believed that the United States is adopting Wedemeyer's strategy: If the Chinese government cannot obtain US action, then the government has a greater chance of self-reliance by calling on Wedemeyer, thereby making China more worthy of assistance.</p>
<p>Howard Expresses Opinion that the US Should Immediately Help China Train Troops</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Pearl Harbor, 18th] Major General Howard of the US Marine Corps, who recently served as Commander of the Marine Corps in China, expressed his opinion on the 18th, agreeing with General Wedemeyer's remarks, believing that the United States should immediately train and equip at least fifteen divisions of the National Army. Howard said: Unless this is done, before the end of the spring of next year, the Communist Party will seize the entire Northeast. He believes that Soviet aid to the CCP "has been going on for a long time. If we had taken prompt action, the situation of the National Army would not be as bad as it is now. I believe that Chairman Chiang's removal of incompetent officials in the past six months has obviously achieved a lot." Howard was captured by the Japanese during the war and is now the commander of the Pacific Marine Corps.</p>
<p>Butterworth Answers Questions About Soviet and CCP Supplies; Coulborn Suggests Ways to Aid China</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 17th] Walton Butterworth, Director of the Far East Division of the State Department, stated today in the Senate Appropriations Committee in response to Chairman Bridges' question about the Soviet Union's aid to the CCP: "I believe the Soviet Union is helping the CCP obtain supplies, as well as Japanese weapons and ammunition, but this cannot be verified." Congressman Judd stated: "Everyone in China knows that the Soviet Union is helping the CCP." Kenneth Coulborn, Vice President of the American China Policy Association, also testified, criticizing the policy adopted by the United States, which is intended to deliberately undermine the Chinese government. He also suggested four points as follows:</p>
<p>Appropriate a considerable amount of funds within the emergency foreign aid bill to aid China.</p>
<p>Immediately donate surplus weapons and ammunition to China.</p>
<p>Supply China with weapons, ammunition, and necessary supplies.</p>
<p>Immediately dismiss all State Department personnel who have sympathy for the CCP or the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Economic Merger of German Occupation Zones: US and Britain Sign New Agreement, US Bears Three-Fourths of All Expenses and Obtains Greater Control Over German Trade</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 17th] The new agreement amending the Anglo-American agreement on the merger of the British and American zones in Germany was simultaneously announced in London and Washington on the 17th. The content stipulates that the United States will bear all imports purchased in US dollars needed by the Anglo-American zone, and the United States will also bear three-quarters of all expenditures in the Anglo-American occupation zone. Britain agreed to supply and pay for all necessary imports purchased from the sterling area, and control over German import and export policies will be proportionally shared by Britain and the United States based on the amount of expenses borne. This agreement, the result of negotiations between the two governments for more than ten weeks, will make western Germany virtually a hard currency country and will force Britain to increase exports to Germany from the sterling area other than food to pay for timber and other goods obtained from Germany. Under this agreement, Britain can be exempted from the obligation to offset Germany's trade deficit with US dollars, which is estimated to be about 50 million to 60 million pounds this year. The United States' acquisition of greater control over German import and export policies and foreign exchange funds was also recognized by Britain as fair, as the United States has already generously agreed to bear all US dollar expenses. The official communiqué also solemnly stated that except for changes in the control of import and export policies and foreign exchange funds, the control over the economic, political, or military policies of the merged zone will still be implemented according to the current system, that is, the system in which Britain and the United States each bear half. The US dollar expenses that the United States will have to increase in accordance with this agreement are estimated to reach 400 million next year. The agreement also stipulates that the US government, in view of Britain's serious US dollar difficulties, agrees to adjust the activities of the Anglo-American zone import and export agencies as much as possible so that the sterling that Britain needs to accept in 1948 is limited to no more than US$40 million. If the acceptance makes Britain's US dollar resources unbearable, the British government may still raise this issue in the Anglo-American Joint Committee, and if necessary, the two governments may engage in discussions to seek measures to reduce acceptance that are acceptable to the US government. The agreement stipulates that the British government will pay materials or money worth 8.5 million pounds (equivalent to 34 million US dollars) to cover the expenses from November 1, 1947, to December 31. In 1948, Britain should import materials worth 17.5 million pounds (equivalent to 70 million US dollars) from the sterling area to the Anglo-American zone in Germany, and also deposit 4.25 million pounds (equivalent to 17 million US dollars) for the import of materials from the sterling area when necessary. In addition, the British government must allocate 33 ships to transport materials from the United States to Germany from November to December of this year. In 1948, the British government should be responsible for transporting twelve ships of materials from US ports to Germany every month. This agreement does not take into account the maintenance costs of the occupation forces and German employees. If these expenses are included, the ratio of expenses shared by Britain and the United States in the merged zone is approximately one to three.</p>

<h3>Jewish Groups Preparing for Nation-Building</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 18th] Goldman, a member of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency, announced today that the future independent Jewish state in Palestine is planned to be named "Jewish State." Jewish legal experts are currently drafting a constitution, in which the international relations will follow the Swiss system, stipulating that strict neutrality will be maintained in the event of a world war. Since millions of Jews are still scattered around the world, the permanent neutrality of the Jewish state is necessary. At the same time, according to another Jewish official, after the establishment of the new country, there will be a period of conflict with the Arabs. In order to deal with this threat, the Jewish state must maintain at least 10,000 troops, and initially allocate US$500,000 per week for military expenses.</p>
<h3>Wallace's Presidential Campaign Faces Setbacks; Third-Party Movement Shows Signs of Division</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 17th] The "Third Party" movement supporting Wallace for President shows signs of division today. This political organization may lose all its political clout. After the American Progressive Citizens Association invited Wallace to be an independent candidate in the 1948 presidential election, the Garment Workers Association, a mainstay of the Labor Party with 135,000 members, convened a local meeting to discuss withdrawing from the Labor Party. Political observers say that if the garment workers, who are not under Communist leadership, and the various unions under the Congress of Industrial Organizations withdraw from the Labor Party, then the party will only have Communist and pro-Communist supporters. Such an organization is unlikely to win the support of independent voters.</p>

The two signatory countries recognize that the establishment of the United Nations Balkan Committee is inconsistent with the sovereignty of the two countries and are determined to refuse its entry into their territories. The two countries also recognize that Greece is no longer an independent sovereign state, and therefore it is currently impossible to restore diplomatic relations with that country. The two countries also recognize that Albania, which bravely fought on the side of the Allied nations, was wrongly denied membership in the United Nations, which constitutes a significant injustice to Albania.</p>

<h3>Austin Discusses Policy Towards the Soviet Union; Emphasizes a Pincer Movement, Combining Economic Aid and Strengthening National Defense</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Chicago, 17th] U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Austin stated in a speech to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations today that the U.S. response to the Soviet Union's policies is to seek peace through a pincer movement. On the one hand, we must use economic power to help free nations maintain their freedom, confidence, and strength. On the other hand, we will maintain our strong defense capabilities, sufficient to deter anyone who attempts to threaten peace anywhere. The current state of tension in the world is mainly due to the Soviet Union's unwillingness to establish a collective security agreement with Britain and the United States. If the aforementioned pincer movement succeeds, it is believed that the Communist parties outside the Soviet Union will disintegrate, and the economic isolation of Eastern Europe is not what its people desire.</p>

<h3>Court Held Hearing Yesterday for Case Against Xin Sui Company</h3>
<p>Zhu Bing, General Manager of Xin Sui Company, and Qi Enfu, Manager, dispatched employees Mao Furong, Shi Wenzhang, Xu Mengbiao, and others in August to sell paper to Minghua Paper Company, Xingzhong Paper Company, Huakang Paper Company, and others, claiming to have 1,080 tons of Soviet newspapers stored in Maochang Warehouse. The aforementioned paper companies then entered into contracts to purchase a total of 26,300 reams of newspapers, and each paper company paid half or all of the payment, totaling 2 billion. It was agreed that the goods would be delivered within seven days, and it was stipulated that if delivery could not be made within the time limit, compensation would be paid at the market price. However, as a result, delivery was not made after the deadline. After several negotiations, only a check for 880 million yuan from the Central Cooperative Treasury was obtained as settlement, but it was dishonored upon maturity. Therefore, the paper companies filed a complaint against Zhu Bing and the company employees Mao, Shi, and others with the District Court. The trial was held yesterday by Judge Mei Erhe of the District Court. The victims also filed a civil suit requesting the defendants to deliver the goods. However, because the defendant Zhu Bing did not appear, the case was postponed for further review.</p>
<h3>Newly Revised Business Tax Rate Slightly Changed</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Finance Bureau stated that as the old and new business tax rates were slightly different, many merchants were unclear about the applicable situation. Therefore, they issued a public announcement yesterday stating: After the implementation of the newly revised Business Tax Law in this city, the tax rates have been changed to mandatory provisions. Those who use business revenue as the standard for taxation will be charged 1.5 percent, and those who use business income as the standard for taxation will be charged 4 percent. Previously, pawnshops were taxed based on capital, and brokerage firms were taxed based on commissions. Now, they are all taxed based on income, and the method of calculating taxes on an annual basis has been abolished. The so-called income amount is already explained in the appendix of the newly implemented detailed rules, that is, the commissions and handling fees of brokerage firms and agency firms, the interest income of pawnshops, and the warehouse rent of warehouses all belong to it. Previously, brokerage firms were taxed at 3 percent, but after the implementation of the new law, it has been changed to 4 percent. The bureau's taxation method is that the business tax to be collected before the summer of the 36th year is all handled according to the old law, and the business tax to be collected after the autumn is changed to be handled according to the new law. Recently, when receiving the business tax returns for this autumn from merchants, it was found that some pawnshops still filled in the capital amount, and some brokerage firms mistakenly believed that the 4 percent tax rate was a miscalculation by the bureau and requested correction, all of which were caused by a lack of understanding of the tax law. As for when the central government's recent revision of the tax rate, which changed the tax rate to 3 percent for those who use income as the standard for taxation and 6 percent for those who use income as the standard for taxation, should be implemented, it is still under consideration.</p>
<p>According to the Finance Bureau: The new slaughter tax rate has been increased to 10 percent.</p>

<h3>More Than 100,000 Companies and Firms Registered; Less Than Half; Plan to Identify Targets; Three Bureaus to Conduct Joint Inspection; Those Engaged in Buy-Sell Schemes Will Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>Yu Shuping, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, believes that there are many companies and firms in the city that exist in name only. They put up a gold-lettered signboard but engage in buy-sell schemes to prevent speculation, manipulation, fraud, and to increase tax revenue. He plans to conduct a thorough investigation in conjunction with the Social Affairs and Finance Bureaus. After it was submitted to the Municipal Administration Conference for discussion and approval, a detailed investigation plan was drawn up by the Business Section of the Police Bureau. According to what our reporter learned, the adjustment targets specified in the plan are as follows: Financial category: Securities firms, silver shops, jewelry stores, except for banks that have been approved by the Ministry of Finance to operate banking businesses. Clothing category: Companies and firms engaged in the business of cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth (various plain cotton cloths, various bleached, dyed or printed cotton cloths), linen (various plain linen fabrics, various bleached, dyed or printed linen fabrics), leather, and woolen fabrics. Food category: Companies and firms engaged in the business of rice, wheat flour, and miscellaneous grains. Fuel category: Companies and firms engaged in the business of coal (coal lumps, coal dust, coal balls, coke) and charcoal. Daily necessities category: Companies and firms engaged in the business of salt, paper, soap, matches, rapeseed, vegetable oil, kerosene, soybean oil, sugar, pigments (including dyes), peanut oil, and sesame oil. Other specific targets: (1) Offices without legitimate business. (2) Enterprise companies without definite business. (3) Trading companies without fixed business. (4) Intermediaries who buy and sell on behalf of customers. (5) Import and export merchants. (6) Trust departments of commercial firms. (7) Brokers without certificates. (8) Brokers who contract for businesses outside of their own. (9) Real estate companies that are not licensed. (10) Illegal real estate agencies.</p>
<h3>Investigation Method</h3>
<p>As for the implementation of the investigation, the industrial and commercial registration cards and business license registration cards of the above-mentioned industries from the Social Affairs and Finance Bureaus will be used as blueprints. The Police Bureau will have female police officers conduct investigations door-to-door together with personnel from the Social Affairs and Finance Bureaus. It is estimated that there are more than 100,000 companies, firms, and stores in the city, and only 50,000 have registered. Those who have not registered will be severely punished, and the parasites of speculation can therefore be eliminated. On the one hand, those who have not registered will have to register retroactively, which will help the city government's tax revenue. It is also learned that the Police, Social Affairs, and Finance Bureaus are scheduled to hold a meeting on the 20th to discuss the implementation of the work of investigating companies and firms.</p>

Yu Shuping, Director of the Beiping Police Bureau, and the owner of Wan Shen Sauce Garden, were not present. According to the vigilante Gu Weijun, he did fire a gun, but he denied shooting Wang Wanshun. Patrol Officer Tang briefly described the situation at the time of the incident. Then, the defendant's lawyer stood up and stated that he opposed the plaintiff's listing of the police bureau chief and the Wan Shen Sauce Garden owner as defendants, stating that Gu Weijun was a vigilante and there was no employment relationship with the police bureau, and that vigilantes were unpaid, which was not in accordance with the provisions of Article 188 of the Civil Code. As for Gu Weijun's service at Wan Shen Sauce Garden, there was no fault in his work at the sauce garden, and the sauce garden could not be held responsible for his actions while serving as a vigilante outside. Therefore, the plaintiff's listing of the police bureau chief and the sauce garden owner as defendants and requesting compensation for losses was not in accordance with the law and should be rejected. After the debate, the court ordered that the case be sentenced on a certain date, Gu Weijun was returned to detention, and the rest were ordered to leave.</p>

<h3>Reception for the Press Today</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The China-Korea Cultural Association, the Asia-East Association, and the Korean Newspaper Company, in order to strengthen China-Korea cultural exchanges and enable the people of the country to gain a deep understanding of the essence of the Korean revolution, have brought to Shanghai the sound film "Hurrah for Freedom," recently produced by the Dongfang Film Company of Korea, which will be shown at the Lido Cinema, and will hold a reception for all sectors of the city on the morning of the 22nd.

<h3>Closing Declaration of the Postal Workers' Congress</h3>
<p>The Fifth National Postal Workers' Congress successfully concluded on the 17th. The congress also issued a declaration, which stated in brief: In June of this year, the newly promulgated "Trade Union Law" clearly stipulates that trade unions in various industries may have national organizations. Therefore, this Congress resolved to change the name of this organization, "National Postal Workers' General Union," to "National Federation of Postal Workers' Unions of the Republic of China" in accordance with the law. From this point forward, this organization will have legal protection, and the attainment of legal status will be completed. However, there is still no international organization for postal workers worldwide. In order to connect international postal workers and promote world peace, the organization of an international postal workers' union is one of the goals that we should strive for in the future. We postal workers have always regarded enlightening the labor movement as our mission. In the future, we should go a step further to promote the establishment of the "National Confederation of Trade Unions of the Republic of China," hoping to concentrate the will and power of workers across the country, assist in the advancement of democratic constitutionalism, and promote the realization of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. This is the second goal that we should strive for. Local postal workers are the actual implementers of postal work. The opinions they express based on their work experience are valuable. We sincerely hope that the postal authorities will convene a national postal conference in the near future to accept the opinions of all parties in this organization in order to seek the revitalization and improvement of the postal service. This is the third goal that we should strive for. At present, the postal authorities do not pay enough attention to the welfare of postal workers. There is no provision of dormitories and canteens, and the cooperative organizations are short of funds, existing in name only. The reduction of salaries and allowances has made the lives of postal workers increasingly difficult. Therefore, we urge the postal authorities to develop welfare programs, issue salaries and allowances based on the actual cost of living index, and maintain reasonable treatment for postal workers. This is the fourth goal that we should strive for.</p>

<h3>Middle-Aged Woman Stabbed Twenty-Eight Times: Truth Revealed in Murder Case by the Creek in Song Park Road; Heartless Godson Ultimately Captured for Attacking After Loan Request Denied</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] On the morning of the 3rd of this month, the body of a murdered middle-aged woman was found by the creek near the Mingqiang Middle School in the Xiangyi Port of Zhabei Song Park Road. The body had a total of twenty-eight stab wounds, and the death was quite tragic. The Criminal Division of the Municipal Police Bureau and the Dachang Police Sub-bureau, which has jurisdiction over the area, attached great importance to the shocking murder case. Section Chief Li personally led Zhu Mengxian, head of the first unit, staff members Chen Xianrong, Ma Feimu, Police Chief He Yaozu, and Zhang Youquan, director of the Dachang Police Sub-bureau, He Peiji, head of the judicial section, and Liu Zichang, staff member, to conduct the investigation. After three days, they learned that the deceased was Zhang Songshi, 48 years old, from Shaoxing, and the murderer was her godson, Li Zhongjian (also known as A Su), 26 years old, a worker at the Yang Rongji sock factory at No. 12 Beile Lane, South Huangpi Road. After investigating the motive for the murder, it was found that it was due to the failure of a loan request.</p>
<p>Hatred Arises</p>
<p>The deceased used to live in the countryside, but recently, due to financial difficulties, she wrote to Jin Yunfa, a fellow villager at No. 6 Xiafu Lane, Gonghe New Road in Shanghai, in early November, asking him to find a house for her, intending to come to Shanghai to open a small shop. Two weeks later, she received a reply saying that the house had been found and asked her to come to Shanghai. At that time, the murderer, Li Zhongjian, returned to his hometown from Shanghai, and the deceased invited him to come to Shanghai together. He arrived in Shanghai on November 23 and temporarily stayed at the home of Li's fiancée, Zhang Jieying, from Hangzhou, at No. 93 Dakang Lane, Shunchang Road. However, the deceased had feelings for Li, because the deceased also had a daughter named Meizhu</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with the Betrothal</p>
<p>, who was originally intended to be betrothed to Xing Li. Now that she saw that the good thing was not going to happen, she took the opportunity to use her identity as a godmother to insult and scold Li from time to time. Later, she learned that Li and Miss Zhang were about to get married, and she became disheartened. Li was still unaware of the situation and even asked the deceased to lend him 5 million yuan for wedding expenses, but was rejected. At that time, Li harbored hatred in his heart and quietly left Shanghai for his hometown at the end of last month. He went to the house of Zhang Arui, the deceased's son, in Taoli Yaojialou, falsely claiming that his mother had found a house in Shanghai, but it would cost 13 million yuan,</p>
<p>Exposing the Scam</p>
<p>Zhang gathered the cash and asked to come to Shanghai with him. When his mother saw him, Li was scolded by the deceased on the spot. That night, Zhang stayed at the house of Jin Lianfa, a fellow villager at No. 6 Fuchang Lane, Gonghe New Road, while the deceased still stayed at Li's fiancée's house. However, the mother and son had agreed to meet at the North Station at 2:00 PM on the 2nd of this month and return to their hometown together. Unexpectedly, when the deceased arrived at the station, they did not meet because of the crowd, and Li hurriedly arrived and saw Zhang still lingering at the station. He made an excuse saying that his son was still on Gonghe New Road and accompanied her there. At that time, Li already harbored murderous intentions and had purchased</p>
<p>A Cleaver</p>
<p>at the Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Shop at No. 469 Haining Road. When they reached a deserted area of Song Park Road, he pulled out the cleaver and slashed the deceased's head, face, hands, and feet twenty-eight times, causing her to die on the spot due to serious injuries. He then took off the gold ring she was wearing and fled after discarding the knife. On the 6th of this month, Li learned that detectives were pursuing him and left Shanghai to Feng A Da's house at Yuehai Bridge on Fuxing Road on the Qiantang River. However, the net of justice is vast, and he was finally captured by police on the night of the 15th of this month and escorted to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Li confessed to the murder, and the police station will transfer him to the district prosecutor's office for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Whispers of Wind, Initial Flurries of Auspicious Snow</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] The mystery of whether it would snow this winter was revealed yesterday. Flurries of white snow, interspersed with sharp winds and fine rain, fell over the city all day long. Zheng Zizheng, the director of the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory, predicted to this newspaper on the 12th of this month, and it has now been fully verified. Zheng based his prediction on the fact that the humidity along the coast was very high, and the cold air from the northern high pressure system was moving and would reach Central China this week and encounter the humid air, so he expected that it might snow. This Siberian anticyclone has now truly blanketed the country, with its center in the Mongolia-Xinjiang area. Nanjing, Jiujiang, Hangzhou and other places in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have also been snowing, and the temperature has dropped sharply, with most areas above Nanjing and below Yichang being below 0 degrees Celsius. The highest temperature in the city yesterday was 38.4 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest was 34 degrees Fahrenheit, equivalent to just over 1 degree Celsius. It is predicted that it will be cloudy today, and there will still be intermittent snow flurries, but they will gradually stop, and it will be sunny tomorrow. The weather forecast is recorded below:</p>
<p>Yellow Sea: Sunny and freezing, gentle north to west winds, medium waves. Central China: Cloudy, colder, local snowfall or sleet, gentle north winds, fog at night. Shanghai: Cloudy, intermittent snow and freezing to mild, light fog at night, local snowfall in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, strong north to northwest winds. East China Sea: Cloudy, rain along the coast, strong north to northeast winds, even stronger winds in the Taiwan Strait, giant waves, even larger waves around Taiwan. Minimum temperature 34 degrees Fahrenheit</p>

<p>[Report from this newspaper] Since the beginning of winter, the water level of the Yangtze River has dropped sharply, and the channel between Tianjin and Tanggu on the Northern route has also gradually decreased. According to shipping industry news: yesterday, the water level of the East River was only 9 feet 5 inches, and ships with a draft of more than 10 feet could not sail. The water level of Tanggu was only 15 feet 5 inches, and all ships could not load as much cargo as possible, resulting in great losses. The Tianjin Navigation Administration has stipulated that from the 10th of this month to the end of February next year, a shallow water fee of 130% will be added, a lighterage fee of 30%, and a pilotage fee of 30%. In the Shanghai-Hankou section of the Yangtze River, a shallow water fee of 20% will be added, and in the Hankou-Yichang and Hankou-Chongqing sections, 30% will be added, to be implemented next Monday.</p>

<h3>"Wan Fushi" Ship Robbed in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Report from our correspondent in Hong Kong, 16th] When the news that the "Wan Fushi" ocean liner of the Java Shipping Company had been robbed reached Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 15th, many citizens were "skeptical" because it was an ocean liner of more than 4,000 tons, not a vessel that traveled on inland rivers. In recent months, the inland rivers of Guangdong have been unstable, and even ships traveling between Guangdong and Hong Kong have repeatedly been subjected to the "hit list" by bandits or even the laying of water mines, but the "Wan Fushi" is the first ocean liner to be robbed after the war.</p>
<p>The "Wan Fushi" sailed from Singapore to Shantou and stopped in Hong Kong for a very short time, taking on less than ten passengers, and several of them were later kidnapped by the bandits. Therefore, people in the shipping company believe that the more than twenty pirates boarded the ship as early as in Singapore, which shows that those</p>
<p>The pirates had planned this attack very carefully. Of the more than twenty pirates, the two leaders were familiar faces, and most of them spoke with a Guangzhou accent. The incident occurred at Mashi Bay, fifty nautical miles from Hong Kong, close to the communist-controlled Haifeng and Lufeng coasts. Most of the local people speak Chaozhou dialect, so some of the pirates also spoke Chaozhou dialect. Mashi Bay (i.e., Dapeng Bay) has long been an area where Guangdong pirates operate, and before the war, British warships often patrolled nearby. Half a year ago, the sinking of the "Qing" ship in a storm also occurred in the nearby waters. The pirates stormed into the captain's cabin, seized the captain and his assistant, and then</p>
<p>Searched and Robbed for Fifteen Hours</p>
<p>on the ship. Under the threat of the pirates' guns, the captain and crew could not resist, so there was no bloodshed throughout the entire process. However, when the pirates succeeded and escaped by boat, they forcibly kidnapped six passengers. Among them were Chen Boxuan, director of the Shantou Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, Chen Jiechang, son of Chen Jiageng, and Bai Qifu, president of the Shantou City Bank. Their relatives who remained on the ship witnessed them being forced away, weeping sadly, and all the passengers on the ship could not help but feel a sense of sorrow. The pirates had already obtained property, but they still kidnapped people to extort money, which is rare in similar incidents.</p>
<p>The passengers with the greatest losses</p>
<p>were in first class. It is said that the value of the property lost was over one million Singapore dollars, as well as gold jewelry, watches, etc., filling a large wooden plate. There were a total of 71 first and second class passengers, more than 1,500 steerage passengers, and 129 crew members on board. The ship's self-defense weapons were also taken away. After the pirates succeeded in their robbery, one account said that three sailing boats came to meet them and return to shore, while another account said that the pirates fired their guns on the ship to threaten nearby fishing boats to come and pick them up. It is not yet possible to verify which account is true.</p>
<p>After being robbed, the "Wan Fushi" sailed back to Hong Kong to report the case and will only sail to Shantou this afternoon. (Special Correspondent Zi Jian)</p>

<h3>Gold and Silver Discovered in the Jiangdong Yangyin Township Treasury</h3>
<p>[Report from our correspondent in Jiangyin, 17th] In the Yangyin Model Town in eastern Jiangyin, in the middle section of Miaohong, there is a large house. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the Zhaoxing Pawnshop was opened there. When it fell into enemy hands in 1937, the pawnbroker in charge of the pawnshop secretly hid a large amount of pawned gold and silver jewelry in batches. During the 1940s, a portion of the jewelry was excavated by He's unit of the New Fourth Army, but the exact amount is unknown. This autumn, the town mayor, Xia Yizhi, opened a village hospital in the house and actively arranged it. A few days ago (13th), workers were hired to dredge the well, and wooden stones and iron bars were found at the bottom of the well. Below them, 24 copper footstoves were excavated, containing gold and silver jewelry and rings, etc. According to weighing, there were 8 market catties of gold jewelry and more than 30 catties of silver jewelry. There has been no detailed count of diamond rings and jewelry, but outside rumors say that there are more than 100 catties of gold and silver, which is probably unreliable. After the gold and silver were excavated, the entire town was shaken. Town Mayor Xia and local people verified and inspected the items and temporarily kept them under the town mayor's custody. In the future, after they are sold, it is planned to build the Victory Bridge and a small vegetable market, as well as various local public welfare projects for the construction of the village hospital. After County Magistrate Xu heard about the matter, he said that the handling method still needs to be handled carefully to avoid disputes.</p>
<p>Jin Yan and Qin Yi Get Married in Hong Kong, Guo Moruo's Speech Backfires</p>
<p>[Report from our correspondent in Hong Kong, 16th] Film stars Jin Yan and Qin Yi got married in Hong Kong on the 15th. Guo Moruo, who officiated the wedding and delivered a speech, said a few words to the effect that "Hong Kong can be regarded as a desert area in terms of culture and art," which aroused the resentment of cultural circles in Hong Kong. This was Guo Moruo's first public appearance and speech after fleeing to Hong Kong, but unexpectedly, it "backfired!" The meaning of Guo's words seemed to be that any cultural and artistic field without Guo or Guo's hangers-on is a "desert area," which is nonsense! On that day, Qin Yi wore a newly made purple velvet cheongsam. She said: "It's the first time I've worn it, and it's a lot of suffering." Jin Yan wore a well-tailored suit with broad shoulders. After helping his new wife put on a dyed red flower, he asked: "Does it look good?" (Special Delegate Zi Jian)</p>

<p>[Report from our correspondent in Wuxi, 17th] Pang Mianmian, a woman from Lang Yixi, Anhui, in view of the central government's call for young people to enlist in the army, and for the sake of the country's survival and her personal future, resolutely came to Wuxi a month ago and went to the local regimental management area to participate in the enlistment of young people, requesting permission to join the army.

<h3>The Mayor's First Education Inspection: Accompanied by Li Ximou, He Departed in the Snow Yesterday Morning; Praised the Good Teaching Situation at the Women's Normal School</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu has always been extremely concerned about education in the city. Previously, due to busy political affairs, he was unable to personally inspect the schools. He recently decided to take time to visit the city's primary and secondary schools, making this his first education inspection since taking office. Yesterday morning at 8:35 AM, as the first snow fell, Deputy Director of the Education Bureau Li Ximou arrived at the mayor's residence to wait for him. At 8:40 AM, they set off together in the snow. They first went to the Municipal Women's Normal School on Yuyuan Road, where they were accompanied on a tour of the entire school by Principal Chen Heqin, Director of the Normal Department Yang Zhiguang, and teachers from the specialized department, including Jing Xiaodan. The school's site was originally the Girls' Department of the Shanghai West School of the Public Concession before the war. During the Pacific War, Bai Xue served as a military camp. After the victory, the Education Bureau established the Municipal Women's Normal School here, with departments for normal education, specialized studies, elementary school, and kindergarten. There are currently over 1,000 students. Due to the limited school buildings, the specialized studies department and others hold classes in temporary housing. Some of the school staff's dormitories and restrooms are located in tents. Mayor Wu and Deputy Director Li inspected each classroom and carefully read the students' assignments and wall newspapers. The mayor was very interested in the school's implementation of "living education." Later, the mayor braved the snow to survey the vacant land behind the school. Because there are still over 8,000 out-of-school children of school age in Jing'an District, which the school cannot accommodate due to space constraints, the school plans to add buildings. There is an area of over four mu of vacant land behind the school that is suitable for this purpose. In the future, the Education Bureau plans to allocate 100 million yuan, and the District Office will raise 200 million yuan to cover construction costs. After inspecting the site, the mayor inquired about the landlord to discuss purchasing or leasing the land for building. After the inspection, the mayor, at the school's request, gave a speech in the auditorium to the assembled 1,000 teachers and students. First, he expressed his impression after the visit, stating that he believed that the teachers' teaching and the students' learning were both quite good. This was due to the fact that Principal Chen is a renowned education expert and relied on the efforts of the faculty and staff to achieve these results, which he was very pleased with.</p>
<p>Encouragement on How to Be a Person</p>
<p>The mayor then offered two points of encouragement: Have confidence in yourself: Dr. Yan Yingqing recently told me that he had recently read two books. One, written by an Englishman, praised six great men in the world who have contributed to social culture and thought. The other, written by an American, praised eight great men. But what they had in common was that both the six and the eight included China's Confucius and Lao Tzu. Therefore, Chinese people should not abandon themselves and simply praise foreigners. Chinese people themselves also have excellent creative abilities. Education not only teaches people knowledge, but should also teach them how to be a person: Although Confucius's Analects and Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching were written over two thousand years apart, the principles they describe are still true today. The current high prices and accumulation of material desires are fundamentally due to the fact that the Chinese people have completely abandoned or destroyed their inherent academic and moral foundations, and what they have learned from Europe and the United States is only superficial. If the Chinese people can all keep the European and American sense of responsibility (Duty), honesty (Honest), sportsmanship (Sportsmanship), and the Chinese inherent virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness in mind and practice them, then China will surely become a strong and excellent country. Graduates of normal schools, when teaching people in the future, must not only teach knowledge, but also teach them how to be a person.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu and Deputy Director Li then went to the adjacent West Municipal Middle School, where they were led by Principal Zhao Chuanjia to visit the chemistry, physics, and biology laboratories, the library, and the classrooms. On the blackboard in the Class A classroom of the third year of high school, there were words written in white chalk welcoming the democratic Mayor Wu and wishing Mayor Wu a long life in both Chinese and English. The mayor made no comment upon seeing this. The site of West Municipal Middle School was originally the Shanghai West School (Western School) of the Public Concession before the war, so the facilities are relatively complete and the school buildings are spacious. There are currently 19 classes with a total of 760 students, one-third of whom are girls. They have now implemented a system of separate classes for boys and girls.</p>
<p>Inquired About Trachoma</p>
<p>Mayor Wu left West Municipal Middle School at 10:35 AM and went to the Second Central National School in the Tenth District on Daxi Road. The school site was originally a British military camp before the war, covering an area of over nine mu, and the buildings were all flat wooden houses. The current access is inconvenient and requires turning into Lane 620 of Daxi Road, which is a narrow and dilapidated alley, winding and long, and not clean. After the snow, it is even more muddy. Only after repeated inquiries by the mayor and Deputy Director of the Education Bureau were they able to find the location of the school. After a short rest, they were accompanied by the person in charge of the school to visit the classrooms and the business office. The mayor was very concerned about the students' health and inquired about whether there were students with trachoma or lung disease. According to the response, 70% of the students have trachoma, and there are not many lung diseases, but most of the students are malnourished. After inspecting the entire school, the mayor felt that the inconvenient access that elementary school students must pass through every day was very poor. The person in charge of the school then led them to inspect No. 730 Daxi Road, where a road could be opened directly to the school. This requires contacting the Land Administration Bureau and the Public Works Bureau. Mayor Wu immediately instructed Deputy Director of the Education Bureau to discuss the matter with the Director of the Land Administration Bureau. After inspecting in the cold snow until noon at 12:00 PM, the planned visits to Gezhi Middle School and other places were postponed due to lack of time, and it was decided to go another day.</p>

Only three subjects were discussed on the 18th, and it is unlikely that all subjects will be discussed by the 19th, so there may be an extension of the meeting period.</p>

<p>Summary of New Basketball Rules</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Duties of the Timekeeper, Section 4: Regarding the Timekeeper's duties during dead ball situations, the following has been revised:</p>
<p>At the end of each period of play, when an official calls a foul or a timeout (including substitution timeouts), and in the case of a dead ball as specified in Chapter 3, Article 8 (E), the game clock should be stopped immediately.</p>
<p>When registering a timeout or a substitution timeout, the timekeeper should immediately start the timeout clock, and notify the scorer when the allotted timeout time has expired, who will then inform the official to resume the game.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, Article 2: A ball that comes to rest on the side support of the basket is considered a "held ball." Article 10, Definition of a Jump Ball, has been slightly changed, the full text is as follows:</p>
<p>When two players, not of the same team, each hold the ball with one or both hands, a "jump ball" shall be declared, or if a player holding the ball is closely guarded by an opponent in his front court to the extent that he has no possibility of advancing or taking other action, a jump ball may also be declared.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, Article 3: The entire old rule is deleted, replaced with "Game Commencement After a Dead Ball," stating:</p>
<p>In the following situations, the game has commenced (i.e., is already in a non-dead ball period): when the official tosses the ball during a jump ball after the ball leaves his hand, when the ball is placed in front of the free throw shooter during a free throw.</p>
<p>Old Rule Article 3 has been restated in the new rule's Chapter 5, Article 10, with a slightly altered meaning, the full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Chapter 5, Article 10: After the timeout time has expired, when the official signals the timekeeper to start the clock, the game clock should be started immediately, unless there is an instruction to continue the timeout. If the official has not given the signal to start the game, the timekeeper has the privilege of starting the game clock.</p>
<p>(A) If the game is restarted with a jump ball, the game clock should be started when the official tosses the ball and the ball leaves his hand.</p>
<p>(B) If the free throw is missed and the game continues, then start the game clock when it is clear that the ball has failed to enter the basket.</p>
<p>(C) When a throw-in is used to continue the game, the game clock should be started when the ball touches the body of a player on the court (the old rule was when the ball crossed the boundary line).</p>
<p>Chapter 4, Article 7: New items (D) and (E) have been added, the regulations for personal fouls and technical fouls have been slightly changed, the full text is as follows:</p>
<p>(D) During the game, a foul in which a player makes physical contact with an opponent is called a "personal foul." (Chapter 10, Article 7)</p>
<p>(E) Fouls committed during a stoppage of play, or fouls committed by non-players, or fouls committed by players that do not involve physical contact with an opponent, are all technical fouls. (Chapter 10, Articles 2-6)</p>
<p>(Explanation) A foul involving physical contact that occurs during a stoppage of play is also considered a technical foul.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, Article 5: The "official timeout" during a 40-minute game in the old rule has been eliminated, but it is still maintained in 6-minute or 8-minute quarter games, and the application time has been changed to after 5 minutes have elapsed in the second or fourth quarter (the old rule was after 4 minutes).</p>
<p>Chapter 5, Article 8, is an important change: during the last three minutes of the second half and overtime in a 40-minute game, the game clock should be stopped for all dead balls. Within these three minutes, the timekeeper only needs to stop the game clock, without needing to wait for notification from the official, and without notifying the official or the teams.</p>
<p>In middle school age team games, the game clock should be stopped for all dead balls after an official timeout in the fourth quarter and during all overtime periods, without needing to follow the official's instructions.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, Article 3: The wording has been revised, and the meaning has been slightly altered: if two or more players from the same team are standing side by side in the restraining circle during a jump ball, then the opposing team has the right to request a change in their positions. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>During a jump ball, each center must stand with both feet inside the half-circle farther from his own basket, or on its arc, and then the official will toss the ball between the two centers, on a plane perpendicular to the sideline, tossing the ball higher than the height any center can jump, so that it falls between the two of them. After the ball reaches its highest point, it must be tapped by either center or both centers simultaneously. If neither center taps the ball and it lands on the ground, then the official should re-toss the ball at the original spot to start the game. The ball must not be tapped before it reaches its highest point, and players must not leave the restraining circle before the ball is tapped. Each jumping player is limited to two taps of the ball.</p>
<p>After a jumping player's second tap, he must not touch the ball again before it has been touched by any one of the other eight non-jumping players, or before the ball touches the ground, the basket, or the backboard. According to the above, the jumping players have a total of four taps, that is, two taps per jumping player. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Rain and Snow Affect Supply Sources; Rice Market Becomes Tight Again Yesterday; Social Bureau Notifies That Only Cash Transactions Are Allowed Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Rice market conditions fluctuate. Yesterday, due to the severe cold and heavy snow, rice shipments from the mainland to Shanghai were slightly delayed, leading to increased confidence. Although prices in the producing areas were reported to be weak, customers were still reluctant to release their holdings, resulting in a tight market. White rice once exceeded the one million mark, reaching as high as 1.02 million, but later softened slightly due to tight credit, closing at 980,000, with each grade rising by 20,000 to 30,000 compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Ji Mingbi, Chief of the Grain Section of the Social Bureau, stated yesterday: Rice market transactions could have returned to normal yesterday, but the heavy snow affected supply sources. In addition, since the 20th of this month (Saturday) is the bank's rest and settlement period, external payments will be suspended. If grain merchants pay for rice purchases with checks, they can delay cashing them until Monday of the following week. Most grain merchants are adding to their purchases, which has led to a price increase. I have already reported this to Mayor Wu and Director Wu and obtained their consent. To avoid speculators from buying in large quantities, the rice market has been notified that on the 19th and 20th (today and tomorrow), only cash transactions are allowed.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Show Mixed Trends</h3>
<p>Flour prices dropped sharply at the opening but gradually rose during the closing, resulting in mixed strength and weakness. The trend for bran was stable. Soybean cake buyers remained inactive. Soybean trading was still quiet, but due to high production prices, sellers insisted on their prices, resulting in an early weak and midday strong market. Customer beans were stable, while broad beans were slightly firm. Green beans from Southeast Asia remained weak, with high-grade goods being average and medium-grade goods declining. Red beans from Guangdong have begun to be sought after, gradually showing signs of recovery. Kidney beans remained sluggish and lacking in trading activity. Broad beans rose sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 due to strong actual sales in cold weather. Red sorghum trading was lackluster, falling by 3,000 to 5,000. Northern corn trading was suspended as boat slots were full, causing a sharp drop of 30,000 to 40,000. Peanut kernels from Guangdong had few buyers, continuing to weaken by 10,000 to 20,000. Sesame was the most sluggish, declining step by step, weak and unable to stabilize, dropping by 20,000 to 30,000.</p>
<p>The oil market showed mixed trends. Soybean oil factories continued to supply sources, falling by 20,000 to 30,000. Sesame oil sales were sluggish, dropping by 30,000 to 50,000. Rapeseed oil continued to fall by 20,000 to 30,000. After continuous drops, shopkeepers took advantage of the situation to attract buyers, resulting in a recovery of 30,000 to 50,000 for raw oil.</p>
<h3>Hua Stocks Surge in Buying Interest; Many Small Stocks Hit Limit Up</h3>
<p>Hua stocks experienced a surge in buying yesterday due to new buying groups outside the market and signs of loosening credit. Initially driven by the strength of small stocks, the buying trend spread widely due to the convenience of the market closure. Many small stocks hit limit up, with Yongsha reaching a new high.</p>
<p>The opening was only flat to weak, with Yongsha opening at 435 yuan and 455 yuan, then rising to 439 yuan and 464 yuan. Later, it retreated to low prices of 433 yuan and 45 yuan. With strong demand from all sides, the off-market interest rate opened slightly lower, at 0.3 yuan and 0.345 yuan, and credit loosened slightly, rising to 445 yuan and 469 yuan. Huafeng also started a rising trend, with immediate and deferred deliveries suspended. High prices were supplied, with some consolidation. Banks and other institutions were buying, pushing prices to a high of 448 yuan for immediate delivery and 473 yuan for deferred delivery. Later, prices rose again to 445 yuan for immediate delivery and 473 yuan for deferred delivery, before closing at 443 yuan and 472 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing prices for immediate delivery stocks, Huafeng hit limit up, Zhongfa rose by 50%, Zhabei improved by 10%, and Meiya, Jingfu, Qinxing, Shangwu, Jinglun, Huochai, Zhongfang, Tongyi, and Zhongge all rose by 50%. Yonggong, Datong, and Zhongni were flat, with the rest rising slightly. For deferred delivery stocks, Huafeng hit limit up, with the rest improving by 10% to 15%, mainly because the discount was very heavy.</p>
<p>In the after-market, Yongsha was sought after and rose, then retreated to 457 yuan and 475 yuan. When news of the National Bank's intervention spread, confidence was boosted, and Zhongfa, Nei, Yongye Gong, and Jinglun all hit limit up. Shangwu, Huochai, Tongyi, and Lian Di also hit limit up one after another. Yongsha then reached a new high of 480 yuan for immediate delivery and 489 yuan for deferred delivery. However, there was some disappointment with the National Bank's intervention, and prices retreated to 470 yuan and 480 yuan. The closing was still raised to 474 yuan and 485 yuan. As a result, compared to the latest closing prices for immediate delivery stocks, Zhongfa, Huafeng, Yonggong, Huochai, Jinglun, Yongye, and Lian Di hit limit up. Shangwu, Tongyi, and Neiyi hit limit up but then retreated, rising by 5% to 10%. Yongsha, Zhongfang, and Zhabei rose slightly, with the rest rising by 50%. For deferred delivery stocks, Huafeng still hit the limit, Meiya and Xinguang rose by 50%, with the rest rising slightly. Old stocks outside the market were still stable. The current deferred arbitrage trading saw rising interest rates due to the limited number of lenders from financial institutions, with the discount gradually rising from 0.22 yuan to 0.27 yuan. Yongsha initially opened at 22 yuan, rising from 21 yuan to close at 24.5 yuan. Xinguang rose from 10.5 yuan to 13 yuan, and Meiya rose from 29 yuan to 35 yuan. New Light also required a strong 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>National Bonds Sluggish; Foreign Stocks Mediocre</h3>
<p>Government bonds continued to be sluggish yesterday. Tong Bing opened at 29,200 yuan, with a high of 29,800 yuan and a low of 27,000 yuan, then consolidating slightly. As a result, compared to the previous closing, A and B fell by 1,500, C fell by 1,800, D fell by 1,300, and E also fell by a small 900 yuan, with a turnover of about 5 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks fluctuated within mediocrity yesterday. Jardine Matheson sold, while Yisha Westerners and brokerage firms from Guangdong all bought. Yisha opened in the morning at 415,000 yuan, recovering to 425,000 yuan and then consolidating slightly. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Jardine Brewery rose by 50%, Navigation and Telephone were flat, Yisha and Baogang slightly rose, and British Union, De Feng, Yeguang, Tram, and Xiangtai slightly fell.</p>
<h3>Qianye Small Loan Group; Foundation Starts Recognizing</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Money Shop Trade Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors starting at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss the organization of a small loan syndicate jointly formed by Shanghai money shops. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. It is understood that the foundation borne by each syndicate is divided into two types: 100 million yuan and 50 million yuan, which are determined by the syndicate members themselves. A circular will be sent to all syndicate members today, requesting them to reply within three days to confirm their determination, so that the syndicate can be established and contracts can be signed after the total amount of the foundation is determined.</p>
<p>It is rumored that there are approximately 78 members in the syndicate. The syndicate's loan office will be located within the Association. Each syndicate member will serve as an agency for applying for loans. A management committee will be established above the syndicate, and all syndicate members will be ex officio members. The management committee will be divided into three groups: review, audit, and design. The review group is responsible for reviewing each loan, the audit group audits the loan accounts, and the design group is responsible for improving the loan process. The loan interest rate is yet to be determined, but it is believed that it will not be too high. There are two types of loan recipients: small-scale handicrafts and small-scale businesses. The loan amount will not exceed 5 million yuan per loan, and either one shop guarantee or one personal guarantee will be required. The loan term will not exceed three months. Interest will be reduced along with the principal and will not be deducted in advance to reduce the interest burden on loan applicants. To actively promote loans, it is planned to apply to national banks for rediscounting in the future to facilitate the turnover of small loan funds.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops Close Accounts; Suspension of Receipt and Delivery Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the period for banks and money shops to routinely settle interest for the second half of the year. All banks and money shops will routinely settle accounts and suspend external transactions for one day. It is understood that the general situation of the banking and money shop industry in this session is still good, and those with larger scale have made considerable profits.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Legislative Council Passes New Bank Licensing System</h3>
<p>[United Press Hong Kong, 18th] The Hong Kong Legislative Council passed the first reading of the new bank licensing system today. From now on, all banks in Hong Kong, whether already operating or not yet operating, will be subject to strict government control. If they violate the regulations, the Governor of Hong Kong has the right to revoke their business license. The government explained that the main reason for implementing this new system is that some banks lack sufficient financial strength, and some banks have violated commercial and exchange controls.</p>
<h3>Prices Determined for Paper and Steel Purchases</h3>
<p>The Review Committee for Handling Imported Goods Arriving Without Licenses and Using Self-Provided Foreign Exchange held a regular meeting at 3:00 PM on the 18th on the fourth floor of the China Trust Bureau to discuss how to add surcharges to the cost of goods arriving at the port for allocation. The discussion focused on "paper" and "steel." As a result, paper was divided into fourteen types, each with a different price. The highest was kraft paper, with a surcharge of 210% of the cost of goods arriving at the port, and the lowest was newsprint, with a surcharge of 55%. Steel was divided into twelve types, with the highest being steel hoops, with a surcharge of 220%, and the lowest being scrap iron and broken iron, with a surcharge of 50%.</p>
<p>The Money Exchange Industry Declares Its Resolution to Obey the Order to Cease Operations</p>
<p>After the Financial and Monetary Management Bureau issued a message banning the money exchange industry, an explicit order was given to the Association on the morning of the 19th. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Association's Chairman Wang Yuncheng and Managing Director Liu Xichen paid a visit to Director Li to report that they would comply with the legal orders and instruct all members to comply with the orders. Director Li instructed that the industry's use of the names of banks and money shops was confusing with the names approved by the Ministry of Finance and should be rectified. All previously used bank and money shop names should be cancelled from today. If they change to other legitimate businesses and retain their original license numbers, the removal of the words "bank" and "money shop" would not be a problem. The Association has scheduled a general meeting of members at 2:00 PM this Saturday to end the operations.</p>
<p>It is understood that the Association had 240 to 250 members in its heyday. Since the government promulgated the Emergency Economic Measures Plan on February 17 of this year, banning the trading of gold and the circulation of foreign currencies, many have switched industries, such as cigarettes, canned goods, candy, and food. There are currently 188 members, with less than half paying membership dues.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Tax Still Pending; Credit Not Easy to Recover</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the National Bank had an excess collection of 58.1 billion yuan, and the tight credit situation has eased slightly. Shadow interest rates are slightly lower, from 0.25 yuan to 0.27 yuan. The off-market interest rates for Hua stocks have also fallen to 0.345 yuan. However, it is rumored that a large amount of cigarette tax, estimated at over 100 billion yuan, is still pending payment today, so the trend in credit will still tighten. Among the various banks, the Central Bank had an excess collection of 42 billion, large exchange outflow of 32.1 billion, foreign banks inflow of 67.5 billion, small exchange outflow of 93.5 billion, Chinese Bank inflow of 13.4 billion, and Transportation Bank outflow of 13 billion.</p>
<h3>Validity of Woolen Fabric Import Licenses; Import Management Permits Extension to Year-End</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] According to information from the Secretariat of the Import and Export Control Commission: Regarding the import of woolen fabrics, the Commission has decided that the original validity period limit for licenses "before the announcement" was originally set to expire at the end of June this year, but is now permitted to be extended to the end of this year. Regarding the handling of imported goods arriving without licenses, the Commission's meeting stipulated that for imported goods in Appendix 3B (such as cigarettes, raw hides, bones, etc., goods with temporarily suspended import), except for woolen fabrics, if the importers are unwilling to re-export them, the China Trust Bureau may purchase them. Furthermore, the nature of the goods in Appendix 3B is different from that of goods such as wool and cotton, so they are not suitable for selling to the original importers after purchase and must be handled by way of public auction.</p>
<h3>Buyers' Appetite Weak; Downstream Market for Yarn and Cloth; 42-count Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Continues to Plunge by One Million Yuan</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw continued selling in the market due to the approaching settlement period for the second half of the year and tight positions on all sides. Buyers were not very active, with only scattered purchases from customer firms and slight absorption by weaving mills at closing. Prices continued to plunge by one million yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In addition, all other yarns also went downstream, with only 40-count Baoguang Ren Zhong and 32-count Fengnian yarns being actively purchased by various firms, resulting in a stable market.</p>
<p>In addition, yesterday's cotton cloth market saw pressure from short sellers at the opening due to news of the US envoy's intensified aid to China, and the market went downstream. Soon, rumors of exchange rate changes caused short covering for next-day delivery, and Shanxi firms also became active, with retail investors following suit, and prices turned firm. However, after 11:00 AM, yarn prices became sluggish again, hovering in the weak range, and buyers' appetite turned dull. In the end, 12-pound Longtou and Zhenzhong fine cloth fell by 3,000 to 70,000 yuan, while Wufu, Caiqiu, Lanjiyanghe, and other fine cloths recovered from 5,000 to 12,000 yuan. In addition, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and biggie and zhitong, etc., also improved by 5,000 to 35,000 yuan, while the market for other cloths was clearly flat and secretly weak.</p>
<p>In addition, the China Textile Construction Company routinely sold cloth yesterday, selling a total of 5,340 bolts and 80 bedsheets, with a total of 125 purchase orders. Internal manufacturers submitted 2 orders, purchasing 240 bolts, and cloth merchants submitted 123 orders, purchasing 5,100 bolts and 80 bedsheets.</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Stagnant</p>
<p>Trading in the raw cotton market yesterday was sparse, partly due to tight credit and inflexible turnover, and partly due to weather conditions and incomplete staffing. Only one transaction was made, consisting of 120 bales of Hankou fine velvet, priced at 4.96 million, and 900,000 for Zhoupu seed cotton.</p>
<h3>Silk and Satin Hovering on a Weak Trajectory</h3>
<p>The price of rayon yesterday had fallen to be similar to the allocated price for this week, so there was not much fluctuation throughout the day. The asking price for 120-count Xu Zi Youguang was 76 million yuan at the morning close. It had risen to 65 million yuan in the afternoon, but finally retreated and was sold at the morning closing price. However, credit was very tight, with more sellers than buyers, and trading was extremely rare.</p>
<p>Factory-Processed Silk</p>
<p>Hovering on a weak trajectory, the market continued to decline yesterday. The asking price for CD grade had fallen to within the 90 million yuan level. High-grade lingdan was at 86 million yuan, and it was still a seven-day term asking price, but still no one inquired, so yesterday's transaction can be said to be almost non-existent. The price of dried silk also fell by 1 million yuan, and there were no transactions to speak of.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>Yesterday's market saw a sharp decline in real silk quilt covers again. The opening transaction price for Huaqiang goods was around 3.8 million yuan, and it quickly fell to between 3.3 million and 3.4 million yuan, hovering there. Finally, because there were more people seeking to offload their holdings, the closing price fell to 3 million yuan for immediate delivery, which was 1 million yuan lower than the previous day. Next-day arbitrage started at 500,000 yuan, then rose to a large 700,000 yuan. Other goods also declined, and due to the threat of tight credit, many people were reluctantly cutting losses.</p>
<h3>Textile Construction Plans to Prepare an Estimated Table for the Purchase of This Year's National Cotton</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Textile Regulation Committee commissioned the Textile Construction Company to provide a purchase estimate for this year's national cotton in preparation for a unified purchase plan. It is learned that Textile Construction has prepared an accurate estimate based on actual data. According to the estimate, the amount of cotton that each factory can purchase and store by the end of this year will generally reach 21.2 million dan. Because this batch of raw cotton is self-purchased by each factory, it should not be included in the unified purchase figure.</p>
<p>It is tentatively scheduled that the unified purchase of national cotton will be implemented from January next year. It is estimated that from January next year until the new cotton comes on the market, approximately 3 million dan can still be purchased. At 5 million yuan per dan, a capital of 15 trillion yuan will be required. It is estimated that the turnover capital for the unified purchase of national cotton will be approximately 600 million to 700 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>The International Trade Promotion Association is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Metropolitan Hotel at 3:00 PM today to pass its articles of association and elect directors and supervisors.</p>
<p>The Textile Export Committee for American Cotton, a foreign exchange import commodity, will begin accepting registrations and reviewing purchases from today. The total amount of American cotton is more than 23,000 bales, and the registration process will be handled first.</p>

<h3>Reaffirming Our Journal's Policy</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>It has been a full ten months since the resumption of publication of this journal. In the first issue of our revived journal, when we initially met our readers, there was an "opening statement" explaining our journal's policy and attitude, which was a great piece by Dr. Liang Junqing entitled "Our Stance." Ten months later, as we review our work performance over the past year, it seems that we have been able to follow our established work policy and have not strayed too far from our general direction. If we were to express some dissatisfaction, it would be that we have not yet completed a certain percentage of our planned work, or that our work performance is not as satisfactory as we had ideally hoped. However, the limited space of the newspaper prevents us from developing our ideas as fully as we would like, and this is one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Recently, to review the past achievements of this journal and its future work policy, we convened an editorial meeting and discussed the editorial policy and scope once again. Among the points raised, there are several important aspects that seem to require reiteration.</p>
<p>The name of this medical journal, "New Medicine and New Drugs," originally continued the old name of the medical journal previously published by Shen Bao several years ago. Adding the word "new" to this medical and pharmaceutical title does not mean that there is some new invention every day, or that there is some new trick every issue, to be presented to our readers. "New medicine and new drugs" refers to modern medicine and scientific medicine. This is because in China, there is still another type of old medicine. Adding the word "new" to the title of medicine is to distinguish it from the inherent old medicine. The original intention of adopting this name for the publication was probably for this reason. Although this has little to do with the editorial policy, it is necessary to explain it in this way for the sake of clarity.</p>
<p>If we say that science in China is still in the early stages of primary school, then scientific new medicine in China, to put it bluntly, is still in the even more nascent kindergarten stage. The reasons for this immaturity lie in various objective factors, but the Chinese people's lack of emphasis on science, their lack of emphasis on scientific medicine, and especially their lack of a correct understanding of the essence and concepts of modern science, are also major contributing factors. The minds of most Chinese people are still filled with metaphysical national essence concepts and national treasure ideas of metaphysical medicine. Their understanding of scientific new medicine is only superficial and partial, and they have not yet reached the stage of thorough and firm trust. This is a major reason why the advancement of scientific new medicine in China cannot proceed at a rapid pace. To accelerate the advancement of scientific new medicine in Chinese society, the only way is to awaken the Chinese people's recognition and emphasis on scientific new medicine. Only when the Chinese people value science and everyone understands new medicine can the construction of scientific new medicine be accelerated. Only by accelerating the construction of the new medicine undertaking with united efforts can we match the construction of a modern new country. This is the first and foremost work policy of this journal; it has been so in the past, it is so now, and it will continue to be so in the future.</p>
<p>The second work policy, which is also the working goal of all popular medical journals, is an old tune: to promote hygiene common sense and to impart medical common sense. The future work policy of this journal seems to take this goal as its central task and as our important mission. The Chinese people are not only economically impoverished, but also intellectually impoverished and lacking in common sense, especially in terms of medical and health common sense. Indeed, the lack of common sense is closely related to economic poverty, but there are also parts that are not entirely related to economics. For example, writing articles on medical and health common sense in this type of newspaper medical journal has little to do with the economy of the general public. The only drawback is that its effectiveness is limited to a small number of literate readers, but this is an unavoidable fact. What we can pay attention to is only the writing skills. In other words, if the writing skills are handled properly, the effectiveness of promotion and imparting can also be expanded and deepened. To explain it concretely, it means that since we aim to promote or impart medical common sense, we must always pay attention to the general reader as the target when we write, and it is not appropriate to take the doctors themselves as the target. In other words, it should be popularized, not specialized. We should strive for interestingness and avoid didactic mechanization. Medical knowledge is inherently relatively boring, and if it is written in a mechanical and rigid way, readers will definitely find it dull. In this way, the effectiveness of our promotion and imparting will inevitably be greatly reduced, and it will be difficult to achieve in-depth and universal purposes. This, of course, depends on each person's writing talent, but we can only encourage ourselves with this, and hope that all colleagues who write for this journal will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Third, this is not a work policy, but it is a point that should be noted. This belongs to the aspect of choosing materials when publicizing medical knowledge, and this is also worth our attention and mention. Since this medical journal takes the promotion of medical and health common sense as its major purpose, we will advocate paying as much attention as possible to the topics of prevention and health maintenance in the future, and strive to reduce the topics of treatment and medication. This is because the former certainly belongs to the scope of popular medical knowledge and is needed by readers. Reading it is only beneficial and has no drawbacks. The latter is mostly a technical issue for doctors themselves. Readers read it with a superficial understanding, and it is not beneficial. If there are occasional random experiments, the drawbacks will be great and the danger will be extraordinary. This is something that authors who promote medical and health common sense cannot foresee. We can only pay attention to it in advance to prevent the possibility of such unexpected drawbacks.</p>
<p>Fourth, this is also something that our responsible editor-in-chief and all colleagues who write articles for this journal should pay attention to, that is, this journal is limited by space and should not have overly long manuscripts. It is best for each article to have a word count of 1,000 to 1,400 or 500 words. Because overly long manuscripts often lead to continuous installments, which will make readers feel that they cannot read it in one go. This is what we hope all contributors, especially those submitting from abroad, will pay attention to.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point worth reporting to readers, that is, within the possible scope in the future, we plan to publish one or two novel illustrations in each issue. In this way, perhaps it will increase the interest of readers a little?</p>
<h3>The Origin of Medicine is Love</h3>
<p>— Wang Juerong</p>
<p>Paracelsus was right! "The origin of medicine is indeed love!" In this world where customs are not as old as they used to be and moral standards are declining, it is no wonder that medical disputes are springing up like mushrooms. We doctors, in addition to seeking legal protection, the only way to prevent this is to develop the "love" that is the origin of medicine! Take love as the patient's "guarantor" and use "love" to replace all "consent forms and guarantees."</p>
<p>Only "love" can enable us to develop more compassion and greater mercy. In this world filled with the clouds of war, only when everyone develops true love can we eliminate the future human catastrophe forever!</p>
<p>People in society respect pastors and doctors because their expectations are too high, and sometimes they inevitably criticize them harshly. In the same situation, people in society need medicine merchants and rice merchants, they are indispensable! Because of the urgent need, the rise in prices of medicine and rice also inevitably makes people criticize medicine merchants and rice merchants!</p>
<p>In this turbulent era, it is a touchstone of our morality and personality. May the leaders of our medical and pharmaceutical groups link up the eight groups that are closely related and share common interests: the Physicians' Association, the Dentists' Association, the Pharmacists' Association, the Midwives' Association, the Pharmaceutical Technicians' Association, the Nurses' Association, the New Drug Industry Association, and the Pharmaceutical Industry Association. Taking Paracelsus' famous saying as a foundation, we should take on the sacred mission for this difficult social group. We must use the "love" that is the origin of medicine to lay the foundation for new medicine and new drugs in China! Give society the best impression!</p>
<p>"Whether day or night, if you are willing, still lock up your restless heart! Is someone knocking on the door? Good! 'Please come in!' Even if it is often midnight; no need to ask the name of the visitor, just ask him if he has suffering. If he is thirsty, if he is hungry... Welcome him, satisfy him!" This is another passage from Mr. Hugo in Les Misérables. I not only picked up a pen, but also added a few sentences to end today's "Occasional Thoughts After Diagnosis"!</p>
<p>"If he is sick, sympathize with him, comfort him, help him, take his suffering as your own, and take his sick child as your beloved son. In this way, we will never be negligent or make mistakes again!"</p>
<p>Although in today's society, what is lacking is "love" and what is abundant is "hate," as long as we tens of thousands of medical and pharmaceutical colleagues unite and develop our sacred "love" to wash away all the "hate" in the world, the future peace and happiness of society will be built on the cornerstone of our efforts!</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that people from all walks of life will give us the greatest sympathy and encouragement! (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Overview of Physiological Products</h3>
<p>— Wang Meixian</p>
<p>Biological products are finished products manufactured based on bacteriology, serology, and immunology, and have a major relationship with medicine. They can not only be applied to treatment after illness, but also prevent diseases before they occur, eradicate epidemics in the invisible, and maintain human health.</p>
<p>The application of biological products is based on the principles of immunology, inoculating them into animal bodies to automatically or passively obtain immunity, in order to prevent or treat infectious diseases. The first invention was by Mr. Jenner in 1778, who used cowpox vaccine to inoculate humans to prevent smallpox. In 1880, Mr. Pasteur also used attenuated anthrax, chicken cholera bacilli, and rabies virus to make vaccines for prevention. In 1890, Mr. Behring manufactured diphtheria toxin and antitoxin, and in 1892, Mr. Behring and Mr. Kitasato manufactured tetanus toxin and antitoxin. These were epoch-making innovations in preventive medicine and therapeutic medicine. In this type of invention and continuous progress, the survival and happiness of mankind have been fully guaranteed.</p>
<p>The biological products that are currently manufactured and commonly used are of the following four types: Vaccines: Some are made from bacterial bodies (Bacteria), including cholera simple vaccine, typhoid simple vaccine, cholera-typhoid mixed vaccine, typhoid-paratyphoid mixed vaccine, plague vaccine, pertussis vaccine, and anti-tuberculosis vaccine (B.C.G.).</p>
<p>Some are made from viruses, including rabies vaccine (two types for humans and dogs) and typhus vaccine.</p>
<p>Toxins: Made from exotoxins produced by bacteria, including diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, Schick test diphtheria toxin, and Dick test scarlet fever toxin.</p>
<p>Serum Antitoxins: All those made by injecting bacterial bodies into horses to immunize them are called Sera, which are antibacterial against the bacteria themselves, including plague serum and dysentery serum. All those made by injecting bacterial exotoxins into horses to immunize them are called Antitoxins, which are antitoxic against the exotoxins produced by bacteria, including diphtheria antitoxin, tetanus antitoxin, gas gangrene antitoxin, and botulism antitoxin.

<h3>Electrical Anesthesia</h3>
<p>— Xiang Longzhou</p>
<p>With the advancement of science, there are constant innovations, each with its own ability. The application of modern electricity is so widespread that it can be said to have reached its extreme. However, its application to the human body is still limited. In the past, it was only limited to assistive products in sound therapy, such as X-ray fluoroscopy and ultraviolet radiation for skin treatment, and direct application to the human body was almost non-existent. It is now heard that electricity can be used as an anesthetic. The application of this method, discovered by two young Australian medical students, to surgical operations is truly a major reform in modern medicine.</p>
<p>These two inventors are both third-year students in the Department of Medicine at the University of Melbourne. One is named Mr. Samuel Rose and the other is named Mr. Donald Rabinov. Both are only twenty years old. The results of their research are more positive and effective than the results of research by people from all walks of life in 1905.</p>
<p>They expect that this new method will take effect immediately, without any after-effects, will not cause breathing difficulties, and will not have a significant impact on the heart. Many experiments have been done at the University of Melbourne to prove that this type of electrical anesthesia can indeed be practically applied. According to the experimenters, there is no doubt that when appropriate electricity is passed through the body, it can make humans and animals fall into a prolonged sleep, and there is no uncomfortable feeling.</p>
<p>The instrument used for this application was specially designed and constructed by the Australian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. This special design is quite similar in appearance to the configuration of a radio receiver. It is small in size and can be moved freely when needed in emergency situations, and can be applied to ordinary daily-use power sources.</p>
<p>This type of electrical anesthesia has been used for further academic trials at Melbourne Public Hospital, and the results have been satisfactory. According to the report of the live experiment at the hospital at that time, when the current was passed through the patient's body, the patient immediately entered a state of sleep. When the current was stopped, the patient gradually woke up, and there were no pain or effects afterward. This experiment used a current of 120 volts, energizing about 100 times per second.</p>
<p>In the initial stage of the implementation of this method, mice were used as test subjects. They were anesthetized by electricity for ten minutes every day for five days in a row. After the last power-off, the animals were immediately examined carefully. As a result, the animals were not affected in the slightest, and they could still perform various trainings they had received in the past as usual.</p>
<p>According to the two young inventors, based on the results of their later experiments this year, they are preparing to further explore this research work. The school authorities have also given them a lot of valuable help.</p>
<p>Dr. R. D. Wright, Professor of Physiology at the University of Melbourne, commented that electricity used as an anesthetic is a very valuable contribution to the treatment of neurological diseases and surgical applications. Electrical anesthesia is easier to control than commonly used injections and inhalants. If this method can continue to be applied further, it will revolutionize the commonly used practical anesthesia method. (Translated from The Medical World - Aug. 1947 P. 197 "Electricity as an Anesthetic")</p>

<h3>Hint Chapter</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>A man was strolling on the road, when suddenly he stopped and looked up at the sky. Apart from white clouds and fleeting moments, there was really nothing else in the sky, but in an instant, a group of people gathered around him, also looking up at the sky. And their necks were stretched longer than his, and their eyeballs were more protruding than his. For example, watching a ball game. The more nervous the players kick, the more excited and ecstatic the fans become. When the so-called "critical moment" is kicked, the fans may jump up from their chairs, clench their fists, and be in a running posture. Even more people shake their legs and make kicking motions. Some people even kick the buttocks of the people in front of them without realizing it.</p>
<p>Merchants can perhaps be said to be the people in the world who best understand dark clouds. Since Jewish merchants in the United States invented the method of installment payments, their business has flourished more than a thousand times. For example, if you want to buy an electric refrigerator, it hurts a bit to take out $200 at once, but it doesn't matter to take out $30 a month. The candy store owner in Nanjing seems to understand this psychology, and changed all the candy codes from "jin" or "pound" to "liang." When I went to buy peanuts, he told me how much a liang costs, but never said how much a jin costs. Nine hundred yuan a liang, it sounds really cheap! Psychologists tell us that many of our daily actions are "suggested" by others. Even a frown or a smile cannot escape this principle. For example, watching a Hollywood movie: the protagonist occasionally says a witty remark, and the whole theater is filled with laughter. But if you ask them why they are laughing, at least half of them will stare blankly, not knowing what to answer. Some people laugh because they see others laughing interestingly; some people laugh because they see others laughing and are embarrassed not to laugh. The Western saying, "Laugh and the world laughs with you!" contains the truth of "suggestion."</p>
<p>The so-called "suggestion" means being led by the nose by others invisibly. There is such a story: someone's house was stolen, but they saw a man screaming for thieves. Everyone ran around, but to no avail. In fact, the friend who was screaming for thieves was the thief himself. For example, if you go to a big hotel to enjoy a good meal: even if you eat oxtail soup, if the waiter asks you, "Sir, do you want to add an egg?" If you are thrifty by nature, you can naturally not add it; but if the waiter asks you, "Sir, do you want to add one egg or two eggs?" you will be embarrassed not to add it! Thinking carefully, life is nothing more than being led by the nose by others, it's just that we don't realize it ourselves. When you are a baby, the nanny leads you by the nose; when you are a child, the family leads you by the nose; the older you get, the more people lead you by the nose, and the wider the scope. If you live to be thirty years old, it means that you have been led by the nose for thirty years. Naturally, you will not agree with this sentence, because you used to often mistakenly think that you are an independent person. Just as Dong Shi rarely admits that she is not beautiful, there are few people in the world who claim to be ordinary. Although the facts tell us that our joys, sorrows, anger, and happiness, especially our worldview and thoughts, are entirely the result of a few people leading us by the nose. A few people create trends (Current), and we are swept into the trend. Two fashion store owners discuss raising the collar of women's cheongsams, and before long it becomes fashionable, and you wear a high-collar cheongsam and take pride in it, even if the "high collar" completely obscures your femininity or beauty. The style of American men's clothing is led by the wide students of universities such as Yale and Princeton; the style of American women's clothing is led by fashion experts in Paris.</p>
<p>If you nod after reading my stuff, you are influenced by my suggestion; if you shake your head after reading my stuff, you are also influenced by my suggestion. Friend, do you understand this meaning?</p>
<h3>Small Cups and Dishes to Pass the Cold Night</h3>
<p>— Guangjue</p>
<p>Someone's poem: "At night, there are rumors coming in, newly bought half a bed of books," and also said: "In the past, I was so poor that I didn't have a single cent, and I added half a bookshelf with my winnings. This year, gamblers are lazy and near, so bookworms should also be completely sparse." After reading it, I was happy for a long time, because winning money in gambling is an unexpected thing, and now buying a few books is also considered a heroic act, and it is impossible to get more, almost only when winning money in gambling can you buy a few books as you wish.</p>
<p>The art of war says: "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle," thinking about how cruel it is. Gamblers often have the right to survive, and winning is very uncomfortable. Thinking about myself again, losing money is also not necessary. So, I suddenly wanted to take a break from gambling.</p>
<p>Having gotten used to nightlife, I can't fall asleep when I get home in the middle of the night. It's cold again, and apart from drinking some wine, there is probably no better way. Buy some chicken wings in advance, drive home, and see if there are any stalls that have not been removed on the road, and add some intestines and tripe. When I get home, I take out the only stock of top-grade sorghum liquor, and also find some dried shrimp, dried vegetables, peanuts, etc., fill several dishes the size of foreign coins, and start pouring and drinking by myself. The children's faces, like apples, are placed on the pillow, they won't turn sour and quarrel with you; the woman is also extremely tired, says a word or two vaguely, and has already fallen asleep snoring. So, I spread a book on hand and casually flip through it, getting a sentence such as "Small cups and dishes to pass the cold night." Although it is not New Year's Eve, it is also sending off the year, which can be a knowing smile. The wintersweet in the bottle quietly emits some fragrance, which makes you feel even more: it is really not difficult for a person to be a god sometimes.</p>
<h3>Old Poems, Present Scenes</h3>
<p>— Dong Jinhu</p>
<p>Recently, I bought a remnant collection of He Yisun of Yongxin, with only one volume of Shui Tian Ju Wen and more than three volumes of poems. Although there are many missing pages, there are about five hundred poems. He was a master of poetry and prose in the late Ming Dynasty. Unfortunately, his name was overshadowed by the nine sons of Yitang, so the world knows little about him. I have been buying books, and I don't choose much. Reading is also easy. He's collection was obtained by chance. His writing style is close to Wei Shuzi, but it is more unrestrained. The poems are not very good, but the folk songs in the collection, which describe the folk life at that time, make my heart jump, because the things of three hundred years ago are still the same today.</p>
<p>The eighteenth folk song says:</p>
<p>"The burden of service weighs heavily on this body, I will not refuse poverty in this life, even if my marrow is exhausted. Let my children have a moment of joy, and save one person for tomorrow's breakfast."</p>
<p>The last sentence seems humorous, but its sorrow is even greater than a long wail of blood.</p>
<p>The fourteenth verse says:</p>
<p>"Although the government is harsh, I have no words of complaint, but I complain that my ancestors' old business still exists. I envy the families in the east after they are ruined, and the urging of rent in the middle of the night does not startle their souls."</p>
<p>This verse is somewhat exaggerated, but the oppression of the people by the yamen is the real situation. This was the case at the turn of the Ming and Qing dynasties, and it is still the same today. I am a native of Jiangnan, and I have a small ancestral business. My family fears officials like thieves, because the property is small and not subject to taxation, but if the family is ruined, they will not be able to live.</p>
<p>The eighth and ninth folk songs say:</p>
<p>"The Baojia pays money and the service is not peaceful, the old records of the Shecang demand the fleeing Ding, the treacherous officials rely on the laws of the sages, and the poor Zhan are wrongly scolded by Kao Ting."</p>
<p>"Babies are carried away from distant villages, the farewell smoke rises from the thatched gates, Taoyuan is also tormented by mulberry and hemp taxes, where is the immortal family that does not break the soul."</p>
<p>These two verses both depict the real scene of rural life. It is not easy to see this in peaceful times, but in times of war, there are wailing everywhere, as Mencius said, "There is no escape from death in a year of famine." He Yisun was once a tribute student of the Ming Dynasty. In the Ding You year of Shunzhi, he wanted to recommend him as a commoner when he patrolled Jiangshang. Therefore, he changed into monk's clothes. His ordination was probably the same state of mind as Chen Zhanghou and Fang Mizi. It was because they first had the pain of their families and country, not because they were addicted to the Western Paradise. However, He wrote the folk sentiments of Ganzhong in the early Qing Dynasty into poetry, and when I read it, it is as if I were seeing the current scenes of Jiangnan. The dynasties are different, and the places are different, but after three hundred years, it is still the same as one day, and the situation is particularly sad. I have been traveling around for more than twenty years! The scenes of my hometown have been the same for ten years. Everything is sad, and everything is angry. I love them but cannot help them, and I only have sorrow. My feelings are perhaps similar to He Yisun's writing of folk songs, which is very lamentable.</p>
<h3>Mysteries of Insects</h3>
<p>— Tong Tuo</p>
<p>A French scientist once studied the power of insects and discovered that a beetle could drag objects forty times its own weight. This means that if a beetle were the size of a horse and its physical strength increased proportionally, it could drag 100,000 pounds.</p>
<p>The pyramids are only 450 feet high, and the tallest building in the world is 1,250 feet, which is just over 200 times taller than a 6-foot-tall man. However, the nests of African termites are a thousand times taller than the termites that build them.</p>
<p>A small green bottle fly pupa can jump out of a box four feet deep. If a person had this jumping ability, they could stand on flat ground, without a running start, and jump onto the roof of an eight-story building. The jumping ability of fleas is even greater, being able to jump to a distance 200 times their length. In human terms, this would be equivalent to jumping over a thousand feet.</p>
<p>Imagine a person sitting down to eat a sumptuous lunch! A whole chicken, vegetables, and "Pan" could keep them from being hungry all afternoon. But if they had the appetite of a dragonfly and their body size increased proportionally, eating this small amount would be like a tiny plate of snacks, easy and effortless. It has been seen that a dragonfly can eat forty flies in two hours. The size ratio between a chicken and a human is similar to that between a fly and an ordinary dragonfly. However, people do not eat chickens, including the bones.</p>
<p>The dragonfly is the insect with the biggest appetite of all creatures in the world. As long as dragonflies have something to eat, they can stand quietly on a needle, seemingly without resistance. A natural scientist even cut off a dragonfly's own tail and fed it to its hungry mouth! (Translator's note: There is a Chinese idiom "dragonfly eating its own tail," which sufficiently demonstrates that both Chinese and foreign dragonflies have such great appetites that they are willing to fill their hunger with their own tails.)</p>
<p>"He Xin Lang" - Baili Liang Rengong's articles often run into thousands of words, flowing endlessly. His patriotic thoughts overflow his words, making him even more admirable. However, his Ci poems are rarely seen. Now, reading his "He Xin Lang" Ci poem, it resonates with a clear and resounding tone. The Ci goes: "Last night, wrapped in the east wind, I reluctantly looked back, the moon illuminated the homeland, so desolate! Bestowing Quanshou to seek Qin is a common dream, could it be that Jun Tian is indulging in drunkenness, and doesn't care about the haggard state of the world. The setting sun dyes the long smoke of the border passes black, gazing at Yinshan, the iron cavalry roams the land, the Han army is defeated, the sound of drums dies! The beauty remains, but the mountains and rivers are different. Whose family's solemn lying Yang, is snoring away! I don't believe in the descendants of a thousand-year-old deity, are there no more men in this world? I ask the spring water, what does it have to do with you? I grieve that people are unseen, and seek the heroic tears of Mingyi. The sound of chickens is chaotic, and the sword light rises." In the spring of March of the eighth year of the Republic of China, Shang Xiaoyun, one of the four famous Dan actresses, got married in Beiping. At that time, Mr. Fan Fanshan had a "He Xin Lang" Ci to congratulate her, saying: "Spring society mandarin duck meeting. Betting on Jin Xuan's high hall, a smile, a perfect pair. Don't think of them as hermaphrodite twin apricots, just consider them flower sisters. Her character is golden, gentle, jade-like. The beauties of Beili know the news, and laughing He can hardly cure the Qingmei taste. Those without blessing, don't be jealous. Golden lotus under her feet, spring makeup is beautiful. Waiting for dusk, personally remove the emerald Dian, and replace her pine pearl pendants; at first glance, strange and shy, carefully examining her delicate face, expecting each other's souls to be intoxicated; willow Dai Yun Huan Nong are all there, only the curved Gong Wan socks please people, you must plant five branches of cinnamon." In the Ci, such sentences as "Don't think of them as hermaphrodite twin apricots, just consider them flower sisters... Willow Dai Yun Huan Nong are all there," express what others cannot express, truly wonderfully unparalleled. If it were used to present to someone else, it would not only be unsuitable but also be a case of "lacking communication." This is what makes this Ci poem good. Reading these two Ci poems in one breath, the initial one soars into the sky, while the final one is like taking a dose of "cooling powder."</p>
<h3>Rescuing Beggar Children</h3>
<p>— Xu Jin</p>
<p>The most important work of winter relief is "rescuing beggar children." It is too cruel, too tragic, and too inhuman to let beggar children freeze to death on the streets! Frankly speaking, this is not something that those organizing winter relief can sit idly by and watch.</p>
<p>According to the "Cha Ye Bao" yesterday (the 17th), Pushan Villa and Tongren Fuyuan Hall collected corpses within two days, totaling ten adult street corpses and one hundred and thirty-one child corpses. Judging from the usual mortality rate, this is already an alarming number. Moreover, from this, we can know that children's resistance to cold is far less than that of adults, so more children freeze to death than adults. Precisely because of this, we should rush to rescue beggar children. Children are the seedlings of the nation and the vitality of the country. Children who become beggars are no exception. After proper education and cultivation, they are also national treasures. I dare say that rescuing beggar children is as important as rescuing the nation.</p>
<p>Quickly rescue beggar children! Gentlemen who are organizing winter relief.</p>
<h3>Free Flowers</h3>
<p>— Chen Shenyan</p>
<h3>Chapter 4: Two Hearts in Harmony (18)</h3>
<p>Qi Wan paused to catch her breath, then continued: "I have tried every possible method, and only now have I found a clue. Because my resources are too limited, the easiest and most profitable thing to do right now is to perform 'Spinning Cotton,' a new novelty play. This kind of play can not only fill seats but is also easy to please and doesn't require adding many costumes. Recently, Dong Zizhi and Hu Xichun performed 'Spinning Cotton' in other places and bought several houses. Everyone says that spinning cotton is a real way to get rich and return home. Many people have advised me to learn from them and perform 'Spinning Cotton,' change my style, which is both easy and profitable. My father strongly opposed it, saying that allowing me to perform was already a concession. Performing Mei school's orthodox plays was still acceptable, but performing 'Spinning Cotton' would be even more of a joke, not only insulting my status but also affecting my father's reputation. Think about it, my environment is like this, and my family insists on this, isn't my future very bleak?" Qi Wan's voice trembled slightly as she spoke, as if feeling extremely stimulated. Just then, the moon was obscured by a dark cloud again. Qi Wan unintentionally leaned her body against Zhu Zhai's side and said, "What do you think I should do?" Zhu Zhai said, "Don't be discouraged, things are up to people!" Qi Wan said, "I have never been willing to tell others my troubles, but because you are sincere, I am telling you. I am grateful for your encouragement, but I am afraid I can't do it. A fallen leaf returns to its roots, everyone has a final destination. Being in this kind of environment, I can't help but feel discouraged. In addition, there is a lot of gossip outside about my family, which really makes it difficult for me." Qi Wan's voice choked as she spoke. Zhu Zhai saw her shoulders twitching, realizing that she was moved and crying. He felt sad for a moment and quickly wanted to find a handkerchief for her, but when he touched his pocket, he didn't have one, remembering that he had just placed his handkerchief on the stone bench for her to sit on. At this time, Qi Wan had already taken out her own handkerchief and dabbed it at the corners of her eyes, leaning on Zhu Zhai's body, silently. Zhu Zhai wanted to comfort her, but he couldn't find the words for a moment. The two sat quietly, while the moon in the sky revealed half of itself through the gaps in the clouds again. Zhu Zhai, in the dim moonlight, saw tears still on Qi Wan's face, thinking that this person was full of emotion. It was truly rare that a weak woman could fight so hard. Her outside was full of joy, but her heart contained pain. Once touched by warm affection, her true feelings would be aroused. At this moment, a gust of autumn wind blew softly, and the moon disappeared again. Zhu Zhai couldn't help but gently squeeze Qi Wan's hand, feeling it was cold. He asked in surprise, "Are you cold?" Qi Wan slightly retracted her hand and said, "I'm not cold! Let's go." Saying that, she stood up and picked up Zhu Zhai's handkerchief from the stone bench, tucking it into her purse. She handed her own handkerchief to Zhu Zhai and said, "My handkerchief has been sat on by me, how can you take it out to wipe your face again? You keep this one."</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<p>Shen Bao, Ren He Hospital, Bao Li Hospital, and Shang Xian Women and Children Hospital jointly organize maternity assistance.</p>
<h3>Jin Hua Feng Family Generously Donates 10 Million Yuan, Hoping Poor Mothers Can Apply Early, and Enthusiastic Philanthropists Can Donate More</h3>
<p>In November, the "Free Maternity Assistance for Poor Women" movement assisted a total of 25 poor mothers, with Ren He Hospital delivering 13 babies, costing a total of 8,488,000 yuan; Shang Xian Maternity Hospital delivered 7 babies, costing a total of 6,642,400 yuan; and Bao Li Hospital delivered 5 babies, costing a total of 3,000,000 yuan. The total delivery costs for the three hospitals were 18,130,400 yuan. According to the contract, this newspaper should bear half of the cost, which is 9,065,200 yuan. Although more than 9 million is not a huge number, the recent sharp decline in donations and the surge in the number of mothers entering the program have caused us considerable difficulties. However, we are not discouraged and will continue to provide poor mothers with the greatest assistance.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Bifeng generously agreed, starting in October, to bear all the expenses that this publication has to pay for "Maternity Assistance for Poor Women." This time, he has taken on the responsibility of paying more than 9 million yuan. This has given us strong support and truly provided greater security for poor women.</p>
<p>We hope that enthusiastic people in society can be as charitable and generous as Mr. Jin, so that the "Maternity Assistance for Poor Women" movement can expand day by day and become a powerful new force in maternal health care.</p>

<h3>The "Rise" and "Fall" of Numbers</h3>
<p>— Qing Xue</p>
<p>In this abnormal economic situation, numbers that were not easily seen in practical use are now becoming as common as running water accounts, becoming "thoroughly domestic." Although stimulating to the nerves, they are also quite interesting to study. One type is astronomical numbers, and the other is exaggerated numbers.</p>
<p>The characteristic of astronomical numbers is not the complexity of the numbers themselves, but the number of zeros. For example, the sun is 1,300,000 times larger than the earth. The "number" is only the two digits "13," but the "zeros" are five in number. Mercury's orbit around the sun is 36,000,000 miles. The number is only the two digits "36," but the zeros are six in number. The weight of the earth (in tons) has only the number "16," but the zeros are twenty-six in number, like a locomotive pulling a long string of train cars, or like a chain, or like a large lantern for the Lantern Festival dance.</p>
<p>Such numbers were previously unnecessary in daily life. Those who occasionally saw them were only in large national statistics, such as population surveys and reports of money and grain. As for ordinary transactions, private accounts, and the prices of goods, there were definitely not so many zeros. However, this is not the case now.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in a department store, many felt hats were displayed in the large glass window. The top one, an American new style, was priced with a "2" followed by six zeros. (Enough for the entire grain tax revenue of Jiangsu Province). The rest were priced at over one million, seven or eight hundred thousand, five or six hundred thousand, etc. Each "number" was followed by a string of "zeros." Hats were like this, and coats and suits were even more so, without exception, with large and extra-large strings of zeros, all astronomical numbers.</p>
<p>Exaggerated numbers were formerly imaginary or vague, such as "hundreds of millions of trillions." They were always in existence but not in use. But now, the expenses of even a small organization, the costs of a small construction project, or the settlement of accounts of a small shop are all in the hundreds of millions!</p>
<p>The old "hundred million" could be seen in the palace examination essays and in the congratulatory words of ministers wishing the emperor a long reign. Such as "Our country has a long reign of hundreds of millions of years," "Great Ming (or Great Qing) for hundreds of millions of years." That is "Long live, long live, long long live" (what the Westerners call "Long live the king"). Because "Long live, long live, long long live" is too wordy and too vulgar, it is not elegant to use in memorials or articles. So, the idle and ancient "hundred million" was used, which both intensified the praise and appeared to be economical in sentence structure. (Similar to the modern economic experts' advocacy of issuing large banknotes to save on paper and the number of characters, which can be said to have a similar perspective. A smile.)</p>
<p>In fact, how could a dynasty last for "hundreds of millions of years"? Even an emperor could not live to such an age. However, the emperor considered himself "long live" without doubt, and the ministers revered "long live" as if it were a real thing. So, it can only be considered an "exaggerated number."</p>
<p>However, "Astronomical" numbers are now commonly seen in human affairs. Exaggerated numbers are now commonly used in the market. Therefore, it is said that the abnormal economy can turn things in the cold palace into something familiar, lively, and booming.</p>
<p>"One," "ten," "hundred," "thousand," "ten thousand," "hundred million," "trillion," "jing," "gai" - these numbers were roughly established. The first stage, from "one" to "ten thousand," are familiar numbers (practical). The second stage, from "hundred million" to "gai," are unfamiliar numbers. The first two digits of the second stage are occasionally used as special indexes ("hundreds of millions" and "trillions of people" can both vaguely refer to countless people), while "jing" and "gai" are thoroughly things in the cold palace. The use of "tens of millions" in the first stage is also half-real and half-imaginary, because tens of millions can also vaguely refer to an infinitely large number, such as "ten thousand purples and thousands of reds," "thousands of doors and ten thousand households," etc. "Hundreds of tens" and other small amounts naturally also have active uses, such as "a hundred years is hard to pass," "completely believe," etc.</p>
<p>The "department stores" that are popular in various cities originally meant to express that they were "all-inclusive" and "too many to count." However, I once visited a certain company and saw that the goods on the first one or two floors were more than just "hundreds" of items. The exaggerated and touted number was less than the actual number.</p>
<p>"Trillion" is larger than "hundred million" and should be more unfamiliar than "hundred million," but apart from the classical terms "hundreds of millions" and "trillions of people," its use in a real sense in modern times appeared earlier than the character "hundred million."</p>
<p>That is, the Boxer indemnity was "four hundred and fifty trillion taels," and the Sino-Japanese War indemnity was "two hundred and thirty trillion taels." In Chinese documents and reports, they were "four hundred and fifty million" and "two hundred and thirty million," but in Western texts, there was no "ten thousand" but "trillion." (International treaties, for example, are drafted in both the native language and Western languages, and French is often used as the basis).</p>
<p>Western numbers "one," "ten," "hundred," and "thousand" are the same as Chinese, but there is no number "ten thousand" at all. When it comes to "ten thousand," they only say "ten thousand" (The Thousand). "Four hundred and fifty million" would be too trivial to say "so many thousand thousands" in Western languages, so they say "four hundred and fifty million" (four hundred and fifty million). This Million is "million," which is exactly the same as the Chinese "trillion." Therefore, Chinese newspapers and magazines also said "four hundred and fifty trillion." Later, even "four hundred million compatriots" was said to be "four hundred trillion compatriots." Therefore, the reason why "trillion" appeared in practical use earlier than "hundred million" was not Chinese but "foreign."</p>
<p>Using large numbers is more economical and clearer. For example, "four hundred and fifty million" can use a plus sign (+) (four hundred million plus fifty million), and four hundred and fifty thousand can also use a multiplication sign (X) (four hundred and fifty thousand times ten thousand), which is confusing when there are many numbers. Using "trillion" does not have this problem.</p>
<p>The same is true of the current "hundred million." The price of a car or a house is marked at two hundred million five hundred million, which is like two hundred million plus five hundred million, or like two hundred million times five hundred million, or like two hundred million five thousand times ten thousand. It is better to say "two hundred and fifty million," and to simplify it further, "two and a half hundred million" will also work.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western numbers have the same characters but different interpretations, with accidental coincidences.</p>
<p>In Chinese, the real number "trillion" is a multiple that progresses from "one, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, hundred million." In general terms, "trillions of people" refers to the countless number of people (such as "trillions of people rejoicing" means "all people are happy"; "governing hundreds of millions of people" means "governing all people"). The Western Million is also the same. In real numbers, it is Ten hundred thousand, and it also refers to The mass of common people, that is, "trillions of people."</p>
<p>The Chinese "hundred million, trillion, jing, gai" has two interpretations: "ten times one" and "ten thousand times one." The former follows the multiple of "one to ten thousand," progressing by ten times each time, so "ten thousand is hundred million, ten hundred million is trillion, ten trillion is jing, ten jing is gai." This is called the "decimal system." Saying "four hundred million compatriots" as "four hundred trillion" is this interpretation. If interpreted according to the current character "hundred million," saying "four hundred million" as "four hundred hundred million" would only be "four hundred thousand!" The difference is too great. The latter starts from "ten thousand," changing the "ten hundred million progress" to "ten thousand times progress," so "ten thousand ten thousand is hundred million," "ten thousand hundred million is trillion," "ten thousand trillion is jing," "ten thousand jing is gai." This is the "hundred million" currently used, the "large number system."</p>
<p>Westerners also have two interpretations of Billion. The United States and France use "thousand" and multiply it by a thousand (a thousand thousand is a million; a thousand million is a billion); while the United Kingdom multiplies "trillion" by a trillion (a million million is a billion). Therefore, when the numbers are extremely large, the multiples are different, just as the Chinese "ten times ten thousand hundred million" and "ten thousand hundred million ten thousand hundred million" are different.</p>
