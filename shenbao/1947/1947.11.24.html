<h3>普選結束與政治教育</h3>
<p>此次國大代表全國性的普選，昨天已宣吿結束。就首都來看，就上海來看，更就各省市的一般情况來看，大體可稱爲中國近百年政治史上的一大進步。</p>
<p>當然，在中國人民敎育水準比較低，中國政治一向有「自上而下」的習慣之情形下，這次破天荒的普選，自難以令人完全滿意。大羣人民對於選舉的冷漠，領發選票的周折，投票手續的不能完全秘密而自由，在民主先進國的觀察家或對民主具有素養的人士看來，似乎都不免要加以評議的。然而我們當設想：一個初學舉步的嬰兒，如何可和運動員作百米賽跑？一個初學游泳的學生，如何可和素習水性的健兒作橫渡黃浦江的比賽？那末，在多數選民尙未飽受政治敎育的中國，初次普選能有大體不差的效果，平心而論，應該是値得全國上下欣慰的一件大事。</p>
<p>所以，此次普選的結果，各地當選的國大代表爲誰爲誰，那個黨派佔多數，這此問題我們以爲還在其次，而表演了中國國民在共匪騷擾不寗的情緒中，還能從容不迫接受了一次政治敎育，顯示他（她）們都願意向民主憲政的大道上學着「開步走」，實在够我們自己和善意的國際友人重視的了。日前大美晚報社論，雖一方面以選民冷淡爲憾事，而一方面却希望政府今後多給各縣市人民以選舉地方官吏管理地方事務的機會。字林西報社論，也承認中國以民主國家姿態出現，實施普選，表現了這個國家政治上的大進步，而且是中國自辛亥革命以來最大的富有敎育意義的措施。的確，我們人民在這一次普選裏，眞正自已做了一次「訓政」工作；而我們希望這類的自我政治敎育或自我政治訓練的工作，今後無疑的還要加强。</p>
<p>我們盼望在這些富有政治敎育意義的選舉中，充分鼓勵一般選民重視自己的選舉權，充分使他們獲有完全自由行使選舉權的保障，盡其可能規定簡單可行得選舉辦法，並制止一切非法的顧斷與活動。國大代表的普選已結東了，不久就將有立法委員的普選；只要全國上下眞有學習民主的誠意，相信屆時的秩序與效果當比這次國大代表的選舉更爲進步。</p>
<p>最後，不論誰當選，不論那個黨派當選較多，旣由選舉產生，都該重視他們的「國民代表」身份；在朝執政也好，在野監督也好，彼此均應時時刻刻爲國家爲人民着想，使中國眞正建設成功一個三民主義的新中國，不再斤斤逐逐於一黨一派幾個人小我的私利！</p>
<h3>注視國際貿易就業會議</h3>
<p>國際貿易就業會議，已於本月廿一日在哈伐那開幕，到全世界四十國代表六百餘人，日來正討論國際貿易機構章程，將一致擁護國際貿易會議一年來在倫敦。紐約。日內瓦等地開會所通過之一切決議，惟預料前途荆棘仍復不少。我們以爲此一國際會議的成敗，對於今后世界貿易的前途，將有重大影響，不得不予以密切的注視。</p>
<p>原來通功易事，懋遷有無，本是人　互利的行爲；個人問是如此，國際間也如此。徒以國力有强弱，物資有盈細，生產技術有優劣，生活水準有高下，加以種族，宗教，邦交等種種偏見，以致國際貿易，除了互通有無之外，不免夾雜了許多其他的作用，從而自由貿易這理想，除了十九世紀的英國曾經採用過數十年以外，迄未能付諸實施。</p>
<p>不自由的反面，即是閉關，封鎖，干涉，限制，統制這一類措施，此往彼來，互相報復。於是本來互利的行爲，一轉而爲互相敵對的行爲；而此經濟上的敵對行爲，又很可能迅速地蛻化而爲政治上軍事上的敵對行爲。翻開近世史來看，凡屬國際間的戰爭，幾乎什之八九以此爲導火綫。痛定思痛，窮極則變，無怪自由貿易的呼聲，要隨第二次世界大戰而再度抬頭了。</p>
<p>所謂國際貿易就業會議，就是道種呼聲的結晶品。其導源在一九四一年羅邱所宣佈的大西洋憲章，其中規定了國際經濟合作，貿易自由，及原料取給一律平等等原則；而促成於一九四五年美國國務院所草對於國際貿易之建議書。此書送遠於聯合國社會經濟理事會，經該會決定於去年十月在倫教召集預備會議，是爲國際貿易就業會議正式行動之開端。</p>
<p>倫敦會議，爲第一屆預備會議，出席者有中英美法等十八國，蘇聯等國則拒絕參加。會議經過六星期，雖沒有具體結果，而對於美國所提的草案，已有十分之八予以通過。並且決定於本年四月十日，在日內瓦再開第二屆預備會議。</p>
<p>日內瓦會議時，蘇聯等國依舊沒有參加，而參加者依舊只有十八國。時間經過了六個月，於十月卅日簽訂了一百二十二組的多邊關稅協定，其中包括項目，達四萬五千之多；其成就之大，實爲歷屆國際經濟會議所未有。杜魯門總統因譽之爲國際經濟關係史上之記程碑。於是社會經濟理事會乃決定於本月廿一日召開國際貿易就業會議之正式會議，其地點在古巴京城哈伐那，邀請者達五十餘國，接受參加者凡卅二國，比兩屆預備會爲多，但蘇聯等國，依然拒絕。</p>
<p>此次大會的任務，自然要比預備會議重要得多了。所幸國際間貿易　章草案，已於九月十日在日內瓦通過。其便利各國際貿易，增加貿易，增加就業及取消貿易方面之障礙諸端，均已獲致協議；而國際賀易上之主要爭點，即關稅壁壘，且已廣泛地分別自行簽訂了多邊協定。可知此次會議的故陣，大部份已淸除完竣。除預備會所保留的諸點尙待商討外，其餘不過把已　決各案；在大會中作一形式上得通過，挨句話說，通往國積自由貿易的大道，可算已於兩屆預備會　中奠定其基礎了。採取廣發的仰狹雜的解釋，要不可不隨時代的背精爲轉移。就现狀　，其具有無限制的自由說爭能力者，可稱絕無僅有。即力未復，尙不得不用稱種方法，節制輸入，獎勵　出，以求國際收支之平衡。美國工榮的發展，就業的增加，可稱已達到了最高度，可是杜譽門總統最近在國會中宣佈，也還要管制出口。其他工業落後國家，其基礎薄弱，不堪外來强力的催殘，而必須注意到相當保護政策，尤爲顯而易見。所以兩屆預備會中，各國對此問題，爭執至爲劇烈；在日內瓦通過草案時，卒不得不採取折衷主義，以調和各方面的利益。最後美法且另行約定，在法國富於期間，所減低的稅率，准予暫緩實施；可政務</p>
<p>抑所謂關稅多邊協定，其目標雖同　减輕稅率，以促進各關係國間的貿易，而其範圍旣限於關係國，則國際之間，無異造成了許多關稅小集團，以代替了規在各國個別的關稅鑒壘，這也與普遍的經濟協調，和澈底地消除國際經濟衝突的目標，相去尙屬遙遠。</p>
<p>自首屆預備會至會次正式大會，蘇聯，烏克蘭，白俄羅斯，南斯拉夫，保加利亞，退羅，沙地阿拉伯，阿比西尼亞等八國，始終沒有參加。雖在　草裹取，訂明以後尙可申請加入，但在未取得會員國的資格以前，所有議決各案，當然不受拘束；則國際間的貿易，至少還保持著兩大陣容。何況英美在約定互減關稅後，英帝國集團的價匯關稅制度，並沒有完全取消？</p>
<p>此外，事實上阻礙自由貿易的，還不單是國際間的那些壁壘，而是多數國家的過於貧乏。因爲缺少外確之故，貧乏防礙了進口；因爲缺少物資之故，貧乏又阻塞了出口。所以產業不發達，購貿力不提高，國際收支不平衡，各國就業率沒有普遍提高以前，從使貿易　壘完全劃除了，而所謂貿易自由，其範　也仍需有限。</p>
<p>要之，此次國國貿易就業會議，我國當然寄予深切期望的，依照過去兩屆預備會的成績，和各國參加的踴躍，此次大會的成就，亦很可以預期的。但以陣容尙欠完整，貧乏又居多數，所謂自由貿易，在相當時期內，恐未必能有滿意的進展。不過在减少國際合作的障礙以促進世界的和平幸福這一觀點上看，這到底是一件有力的工具，我們願在此，祝自由貿易的眞正　辭，幷升檔必將鞠躬　瘁，直至最很一課。</p>

<p>于子三談話筆錄　「問」你現在還擔任浙大學生自治會得主席嗎？「答」現在還祖任　，但我很想攏脫華個職務。「問」一方面是很想擺脫這個聽務（另一方面卻在準備爭取改選的成功，這不是與你所稱的有極大的矛盾嗎？「答」是的，我自己也覺得矛盾。「問」你們校裏已準備成立普選機構，普選是一種公開的競選，你爲什麽要領導一個小組織，秘密內定各系的代表，而這些人又多半是新潮社與讀書會的份子，顯然的，你們是具有操縱代表席位的陰謀。「答」邀的確不十分對，但我自己也不知道爲什麽要這樣做，似乎背後總像有一股什麼力在推動我。「問」什麽力最？「答」有人命令我這樣做。「問」什麽人？「答」現在不能講。「問」新潮社爲什麽要採取秘密活動的方式，而你們所讀的書，又都是十足反動的，你們赤化一個人，先從各種反動基本哲學開始，並且以聯共黨史，四大家族，作爲教育的工具，這難道與你們新潮社所標榜的促進民主，發　社會事榮的宗旨，相吻合嗎？（無言未置答）「問」目前新潮社的中心活動是幾項？「答」　聯絡各地社員，廣泛嚴開社的各種活動，吸收社員。　發發生產事業，以裕社的經費（像奉化的桃園，即是生產之一）。　爭取浙大學生自治會的代表名鎖。　在校內外組織宣書會，由鄉伯瑾負責，互相硏究傳閱各種共黨理論書報，讀書會的書籍，是劉伯瑾負責搜築。　傳達並聯絡上下的命令與意見。「問」新潮社有沒有立過案？「答」沒有立過案，也沒有向校方登記過。「問」浙大學生自治會，有沒有秘寧參加全國學聯會？「答」浙大絲漢聯會組織單位之一。「問」學聯與共黨及民盟的關係如何？「答」學聯的主要份子，大都是接受共黨與民盟的領導的。「問」據說新潮社不僅是反動集團的一個核心，並且是與學聯連絡的一個機構。「答」是的，在新潮社各稱活動的方式上，的確是接受了共產黨民盟的做法，我可以承認，新潮社在事實上是與共產黨民盟貫通一氣的。「問」不過話又說回來，政府對你們始終是寬大爲懷，况且你們終究還是學生，過去的錯誤可以彌補，中國四萬萬五千萬人中，有幾個大學生，國家栽培你們，父母敎養你們，爲的是什麼？「答」這些我們何嘗不知道。「問」政治是人生的過程，在政治上立場不同，也是普通的事情，但當自己的政見這反國家民族的利益時，就應該毅然捐棄成見，服從關家民族的利益，希望你能澈底轉變你的態度。「答」這要請你給我一個考慮的機會，我可以自動的將我所曉得的關於新潮社的活動，共產黨與學聯的聊縏，浙大續書會的各種情形寫出來等語，則新潮社與學聯會，議書會，均爲共產黨之外圍組織，秘密活動，相與策應已嚴言之歷歷如繪。（未完）</p>

<h3>法局勢未離險境工潮擴大鐵路交通斷絕許曼組閣已獲議會支持</h3>
<p>〔合衆社巴黎廿三日電〕法國罷工怒潮　中，已四日無政府，新總理而臨之主要難題爲左翼社會黨人反對一切不擬繼續國家管制經濟之政府。傳社會黨秘書長莫萊領導下之一派，以繼續國家管制爲加入許曼內閑之條件。許曼則被認爲係主張放　國家隊經濟指導者。同時共黨發動之罷工潮，已深入法國經濟之　理，工人約一百萬名在罷工狀熊中。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿三日電〕許曼總理　夜進行組閣商談，渠今晨四時表示：今日下午繼續進行商談時，可望有更迅連之進展。其先社會當前　　魯姆親自出而垢術社會黨員與　學問就新政府經濟政策之意見。勃魯姆竟夜頭許當及其社會黨同　用電話接觸，社會黨在其秘書長莫莢之領導下，似與前總理業諾之意見相左。開義諾　　除非能予以自由處　其所管部份職務之　，不願担任副總理以負責財政經濟事務。許曼與政黨領袖晤談七小時後，即向歐禮和總統報吿。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿二日電〕人民共和黨許曼今夜正式被任爲內閣總理，國民議會已以四百十二票對一百八十四票通過信任案，另廿一票棄權或缺席。共產然及其同情者均投反對票，戴高樂派則投贊成票或棄權。先是，許曼在議會宣稱，將以保衛法國爲天職，並對勞工合法要求與歐洲各地裏動事件，嚴加別，希望即能組織新閣處理工潮。同時，在共產黨操縱之總工會領導下，罷工人數已超過七十五萬。巴黎明日恐將有亂事爆發，卡車多　滿載軍警，携槍開入市區，以防萬一。民衆聆悉破壊重要秘密軍火庫四處，且暴徒昨夜　斷郊區要塞電話織後，情緒顯極不安。另據警局聲稱，某工塲昨夜失竊濃催淚氣一夸爾。電諾汽車廠爆炸後，共黨工人二名因在該處製造炸彈，已予逮捕。全國鐵道與商船工人局部罷工，南部冶金·建築·煤礦·船塢·麵粉等業及巴黎區學校敎育均捲入漩渦。東南部與巴黎里昂間火車完全停頓，巴黎北部交通亦吿斷絕。馬饗·波爾多·南特及處昂等地商船水手，紛紛響應各大城市船塢罷工工人。勒哈佛脚夫則定明日罷工。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎廿二日電〕馬賽市議會今日召開十日前共黨黨與戴高樂派議員互毆以來之第一次會議，淮共黨議員以議塲內駐有武裝警衛一人，爲表示抗議起見，退出會塲。</p>
<h3>四強對德問題意見隔閡外長會前途黯淡　莫洛托夫經柏林抵倫敦</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦廿三日度播：蘇外長莫洛托夭已於今日自柏林飛抵此問，準備出席於星期二揭幕之四强外長會議。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕外長會議已定週二揭幕，然議程草案仍未有協議成立。英美法之一方面及蘇聯之一方面將各有議程提出，故外長會之音要任務，在決定各項目之討論順序。關於外長代表會之報吿亦未有協議，故每一代表或須個別向本國外長提出報吿。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿二日電〕英外交部坦白承認外長會議之成敗，全視莫洛托夫之態度而定。如莫氏所取熊度，較代表會議中蘇方態度合理，則外相員文擬以全力促成協議，否則會議可於三數日間決裂。</p>
<h3>索柯洛夫斯基施放開幕砲　克萊深表遺憾</h3>
<p>〔路透社柏林廿三日電〕美軍區長官克萊將軍於啓程赴倫敦參加外長會議之前夕，招待記者發表談話，對蘇穌軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基日昨發表之談話表示遺憾。渠覺索氏所發表諸點，並不新穎，故不解其用意何在。常被詢及對本屆外長會議是否樂觀時，答日，「余若表示樂觀，乃因不能協議之形勢已至極端，故反而有轉機之可能性。今日各關係强國今日均已承認在德國之治理機構，實已停止活動，此固前此外長會議前所未嘗有。」</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿三日電〕德境蘇軍總司令索柯洛夫斯基，在盟管會席上嚴厲抨擊西方强國後，使人相信本屆外長會議開幕時，妥協的精神將付缺如。觀察家重視發表此項抨擊之時間更在其內容之上，蓋其大部份之指責多爲老調，前此已經被攻擊者予以答覆者。値得重視者乃爲此項抨擊發表在外長會之前夕，及塔斯社之即時予以普遍發表。外長代表會之蘇代表史米諾夫上週即已表示世界與論常願意知悉解除武裝及肅淸納粹等兩點，已執行至何種程度，此係暗示蘇聯在外長會中將提出西方國家如何管制德國之問題。索柯浴夫斯基今又更進一步譴責西部三佔領當局之未能履行四强務定，不啻預示蘇聯在外長會中之態度，英國管制委員會某高級官員固已表示，「索　洛夫斯華之之聲明，乃外長會議之開幕砲耳」。</p>
<h3>蘇聯積聚黃金　打擊馬卿計劃</h3>
<p>〔中央社紐約廿三常〕據研究蘇聯經濟事務之專家蒲林斯稱：蘇聯現正秘密囤聚大量黃金，作爲抑制馬歇爾對歐洲復原計劃之武器。蒲氏在本期「聯合國世界」雜誌，撰文指出穌聯之囤聚黃金，乃其共黨中央委員會書記長日丹諾夫所發警吿背後之「堅强經濟實質」蒲氏認爲蘇聯能在其勢力範圍内成立嚴格之盧布區域，而在世界其他部份，將其貨　訂爲金本位。在重要之貿易區，可以有效對抗美元及代替英鎊，此舉將干涉目前國際貿易市場中美元之獨佔情形，並劇烈影響國際市塲中之物價機構。蘇聯世界經濟硏究所曾宣稱：蘇聯境內過去十五年來曾發現許多金礦，因此　自一九二六年之世界第十五位產金國家升至一九三六年之第二位，今日或已升爲第一位估計蘇聯現有黃金價値，約爲一百七十億美元，較美國僅少約五十億美元。</p>
<h3>法幣在薩爾流通蘇聯方面表抗議</h3>
<p>〔路透社弗蘭充福廿二日電〕美軍區德國新聞社稱：德軍區法軍總司令寇尼許將軍昨在盟管會　上稱，法國業已依照　　人民之志願，在　爾行使法郞。英美代表當表示容後就此事聲明能度，而蘇代表索柯洛夫斯基則對法國之以旣成事實向盟管會提出，表示抗戰，並聲明容　　　　態度。</p>
<h3>希要求義艦</h3>
<p>前　領調查委員會得聆取當地義人意見</p>
<p>〔路透社雅典廿二日電〕雅典通訊社稱：四强海軍專家於十二月一日在羅馬開會討論義艦分配時希臘將要求分享義海軍艦船。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦廿二日電〕討論義前屬領之四强外長代表，頃決定四强調查義前　領之委員會，得聆取　地義大利移民之意見，聆取方式等由調查委員會決定。各代表復議決，阿比西尼亞義大利埃及提出之意見，交調查委員會調查，俾知有無與事實相反之處。各代表復承認已護各關係國政府之　文，並議決將於一月間向各關係國通知蒞會陳述意見之日期。外長代表會在外長會　結束前，不致再開會議。</p>
<h3>美衆院小組委員會擬定美援外條件　建議成立援外專職機構</h3>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓廿二日電〕美衆院關於援外計劃之委員會頃發表其初步報告，爲接受援助之國家擬定條件。祁吿中說明，此項條件雖專爲西歐而訂，然其中所列之一般原則，亦可適用於日後需要美國協助之其他國家。</p>
<p>該委員會建　爲使接受國家之眞正需要得以及早滿足，其經濟得以及早恢復，同時亦不必使美國之經濟負担過重起見，在擬定或舉行任何援助計劃時，必須顧及以下各點：　接受國家應纠正其財政金融及貨幣弱點，以求穩定外匯，並恢復其貨幣之信用；　接受國家應努力增產食糧及物資，以解決其基本國內重大需要；　接受國家應促進本身貨物及勞力之經濟交換，以將其本身及外來之資源作有效之分配與利用，同時亦需謀求减少外匯管制，商務限額限制，及妨害貿易之其他辦法；　美國以外之可以實行援助之國家，應盡量合作；。鼓勵私人方面擔負緊急行動，並給與便利，在目前之危機中，此項行動皆係交由政府處理；　接受國家應對美國所給與之援助之用途，來源性質，及數量，充分公開發表·該委員會並建議成立一名爲緊急外國復興局之新聯邦機構，以執行援助計劃，其中對每一國家有一執行委員會，包括美國及接受國家之代表；此外，同時成立一援外委員會，委員中包括國務卿及其他閣員，而爲總統對於援助計劃及政策之顧問與諮詢機構。</p>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓廿二日電〕今日據悉，參院下週可望批准杜魯門總統歐洲緊急救濟法案，但國內物價管制與長期對外援助兩案則尙有待。參院外交委會主席范登堡現定廿四日出席，要求從速撥款五億九千七百萬美元，協助法，義，奧三國抵抗其政治動亂與凍餒之雙重威脅，並使國會在該案通過後，可獲充分時間對馬歇爾長期援助西歐十六國復興方案作從容且詳盡之審查。據參院度支委員會主席勃里傑斯宣稱，該會表決緊急援助法案經費前，當先調查美國糧食，俾與法，義，奧三國需要　照斟酌。</p>
<h3>動盪中的法國政局　本報編譯室特譯</h3>
<p>美國的援助可能來得太遲，或許來不及把法國從崩潰中拯救出來，這種恐懼正與日供增。法國的溫和份子正故意延緩復興的步伐，籍求制止通貨膨脹，因爲進行復興工作是需要錢的。但是這種計　不容易得到一般人的擁護，極難甚至不可能予以實施。共產黨正在領導罷工，反共份子正在囤積小麥和黃金作爲政治資本，溫和派正在失勢之中。</p>
<p>法國危機的嚴重性，可以從「世界出吿週刋」駐巴黎特派員的一個電報中囈出來，他說：</p>
<p>工資標準雖然和夏李時一樣，物價已大大上漲。食物的官單在八月份一個月中就幾乎漲了百分之廿五。工業品，原料，和牛製品比一九三八年的水進幾乎高了八倍。但是官價並不足以代表市價，例如照官價在市塲上根本買不到白塔汕，黑市價格要比官價貴上好幾倍。</p>
<p>逃稅的情形已經到了高峯。政府的大部份收入都　工人的所得稅，因爲這種稅是直接從工資中扣下來的，職是之故，勞工的負擔日益加重，以致非要求增加工資不可。政府感到最困難的，就是在本年底前，實在無法巡行任何有效的改革。</p>
<p>法朗價格的低落，反映出法國財政經濟的薄弱。法國的黃金準備已自一九三九年二十七億〇九百萬美元的高　，降低到五億四千四百萬美元。但是準備金少了，通貨即在增加，根據統計，一九三九年法國的紙幣發行額是一千五百十億法郞，現在已經增加到八千七百四十億法郞了。</p>
<p>本年初，政府估計法國人可以購貿國家公債十一億四千萬美元，但是結果公債賣不掉，到期的公債卻一定要用現金付出。法國現在在國內旣無存款在國外又無美元，以應付日當的支出。一九四八年度，國家的收入大約在五十五億美元左右，而支出則在八十億美元左右。爲求預算的平衡起見，不得不大事　節。</p>
<p>依照上面的估計，　節的數額約在二十五億美元左右。若干可以不受議會限制而實行撙節的措置，已經在實施之中了。軍隊裏的軍官將减少百分之十五；一艘新航空母艦的建造工作已經停頓下來；在一月一日前，所有應受兵役訓練的人，祗有牛數塞召入伍。</p>
<p>假如能够得到議會核准，由國家付款的戰後復興建設將暫予停止；對戰時民衆損失的補償，將延期發付；各地的重建工作，應在當地籌款進行；銀行放款擬加以管制，法國銀行的放款利息已由百分之一又四分之三增加到百分之二·五，凡沒有正當需要者將無法獲得放款，商人在借款之前必須將所囤貨物在市塲上出售。</p>
<p>這個計劃頗爲華盛頓方面所歡迎，因爲美國政府官吏一向認爲法國人錢用得太多，但在法國國內，頗遇阻力。工人要求增加工資，反對戴高樂派抬頭，以致罷工事件層出不窮，結果可能使法國整個經濟陷於麻痺狀態，而農民的囤積小麥以及資本家的儲藏黃金，使通貨膨脹更難以收拾。</p>
<p>假如溫和派不能勉力支持，以待美國援助的到來，那麽法國可能會出現一個新的政權，而這個政權的特質，決不是溫和的。（譯自「世界報告週刋」）</p>
<h3>德境英美合倂區已成立財政協定　兩區佔領費用全部由美負担</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓廿二日電〕構威方面息：英美就修改德境英美合併區規則所進行談判判之各未決點，均已獲致原則上之協議。雙方代表已在從事整理後條文，約在下週即可在倫敦及筆盛頓同時正式公布。所已成立之議，包括：　芙方同意使合併區聯合輸出部賬目上之英鎊剩餘額約一千八百萬鎊，兌爲美元，惟爲避免英國美元之即時减少起見，常不使突然全部承兌。　自一九四八年一月一日起，美國將負担兩區之全部美元費用，故美國在兩區資金之處分方面，將獲得更多之發言權。惟英美平等負擔合併區行政責任之原則，並不因此變更。　規定英國將自英鎊區輸入英美合併區之貨物之肯定比例量。據悉此一協定並不計及倫敦之外長會議，故若外長會議失敗，而法國決定參加合并，則勢須另草新辦法。</p>
<h3>英副首相莫理遜表示英經濟局勢好轉　邱翁譴責工黨政府誤國</h3>
<p>〔路透社約克郡　　　廿三日電〕副首相莫理遜在此間之鼓勵生產運動中發表演說，聲言各種象徵預示英國不久即可克服其目前之困難。衆認莫理遜此此次演說，爲各內閣大臣之言論中最樂觀者。</p>
<p>渠云：雖然糧食原料俱感缺乏，各種困難仍多不勝數，然在找整個經濟陣綫之最重要部份，即基本及出口工業，已有進步的省定象徵。英國目前生產量之高，已達五年來之最高峯，工程工業產量已超過戰前，　鐵產量亦達最高記錄，今日或已爲我　大復興之開始。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿二日電〕反對黨保守黨領袖邱吉爾廿二日聲稱：如工黨政府繼續續執政，則英國將全部陷入破產及飢荒。邱吉爾謂：社會主義政府本不値得民衆信任，其政權乃係以虛僞之諾言得來。</p>
<h3>蘇聯砲兵節</h3>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科廿三日電〕蘇聯全國今日慶祝砲兵節，莫斯枓列寧格勒各共和國首都及各主要城市，齊鳴禮砲二十响。蘇砲兵司令勃拉契柯夫於砲兵節前夕發表廣播，　言世界帝國主義已在準備另一戰爭，以毀滅民主及社會主義，故蘇聯砲兵以及其他蘇軍部隊，務須在經常準備狀態之下，每一軍人自小兵至上將，必須盡力使蘇聯之砲兵雄踞世界首席。</p>
<h3>取締法西斯義國會通過法案</h3>
<p>〔路透社羅馬廿二日電〕養制　　會頃通過取締法西斯運動之法律，規定有從事組織指揮或津貼三人或三人以上之武裝團體，以諜恢復法西斯黨或君主政體者，處十年以上卅年以下有期徒刑，並沒收其全部財產。</p>
<h3>美實業家打擊裴柏</h3>
<p>〔合衆社弗羅里達州傑克遜維伊廿二日電〕實業家若干人　二日開始發動打擊參議員裴柏之鬥爭，蓋裴柏會斥之爲「自私自利之反動集團，十二年來均欲使羅斯福去職而後快」。</p>
<h3>國際共產情報局將發表重要宣言　歐洲共黨領袖接觸頻繁</h3>
<p>〔合衆社普拉格廿三日電〕此間政治觀察家正密切期待國際共產情報局歐洲「冷淡戰爭」策略上之重大新方略宣言。觀察家聲言，重要談話正在舉行，以調整共產黨對最近國際時事之政策。</p>
<p>可靠方面報吿，匈牙利副總理賴柯錫本週初已在莫斯科。自十一月初迄今，法共總裁陶萊士長留莫斯科。南總統蒂托廿三日在薩拉協伏出現，本擬二十三日在保京與保總理第米特洛夫晤見之計亂又吿展延。第米特洛夫於「長假」後，二十日已返抵保京。觀察家稱：共產情報局發表宣言，時機已至，蓋自九月廿八日該局在波蘭散會後，至今已有下列之發展：　美特別國會將表決　行馬歇爾計劃；　倫敦將舉行四外長會議；　法義共黨加强反政府之罷工及通　暴動；　羅馬尼亞·保加利亞·匈牙利·及波蘭等國，淸除米柯拉茨克等反對派後，東歐參加共產情報局之政府已鞏固其統治權；　國加强援希。共產人士相信，波蘭工人黨（即共產黨）秘書長戈墨卡爲出任貝爾格勒情報局常任主席之最有希望人選。戈氏現任波總即兼西勒西亞收復區部長，在華沙會議中亦爲主席。共產情　局第一計劃爲出版刊物，登載黨方指示及演詞，已於本月在南國京城社論及印刷部申開始工作。</p>
<h3>本屆聯大開會十星期　美蘇裂痕益明顯　我國宣布支持聖地分治</h3>
<p>〔合衆社絲約廿三日電〕聯合國大會行將結束之際，大多數代表之綜合意見，認爲本屆大會之主要成就，爲蘇聯及西方國家進一步之分裂。大多數代表以爲過去十星期中大會中之票決，顯然表示在美國與蘇聯經濟及思想力量之　牌考騐中，至少有四分之三之國家支持美國。</p>
<p>大會結束時空氣　淡，代表私下對聯合國前途抱悲觀者爲數日增。蘇聯似逐步與聯合國之實際工作宣吿分離，同時尙無正式脫盟之傾向。巴爾幹　查團，小型聯大及聯　國遺韓委員會，造成三次大分裂。美國首倡此三建議，雖遇穌　最　勁之反對，卒獲大會通過，而　聯則宣佈對此一致予以抵制。大多數代表僉認，如無蘇聯參加，聯合國在巴爾幹朝鮮及小型大會三方面難　具體之成就。美蘇能獲協議者，僅爲巴勒斯坦分爲猶阿兩邦而已。</p>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖廿二日電〕中國今日在聯合國大會宣布贊成巴勒斯坦分治計劃，結束其猶疑不決之態度。顯維鈞稱，分治固非完全使人滿意之解決辦法，此蓋由於阿拉伯極表反對之故，但分治政策實爲解決間題之唯一方法，且可能有所成就。據稱，中東之和平端賴巴勒斯坦問題得以早日解決，渠希望時間能使分治漸生效力。</p>
<p>氏稱，中國非到最後關頭，仍不願宣布其贊成分治之立塲，蓋渠繼續希望猶人與阿人之問可獲和解散也。然目前和解似已不可能，故中國必須對決策方面有所表示。渠稱、如本次大會不採保取動，則近近平靜將不可</p>

<h3>煤礦國營案糾紛何多日議員再度動武　在野政黨歸罪議長失職</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京　二日電〕日執政黨與在野黨，今日下午在衆院中繼續爭論煤礦國營法案時，發生鬥歐。先是自由黨議員今村長太郞，意圖越過議會護衛人士，與衆議院議長松岡駒吉相博，　衛人員十名當上前阻攔今村，另一自由黨議員乃乘機衝往講壇，致會議進行時，混亂萬分，　分鐘後，始恢復秩序。</p>
<p>按自廿日討論煤礦國營法案發生動武情形後，衆院講台前即佈有　衛人員。又民主黨執行委會委員古煙德野於表決煤礦國營法案時曾與自由黨一致投反對票，故民主黨取消其執行委員資格。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿三日電〕工礦委員會委員長伊藤卯四郞之中問報吿，廿二日午後八時半起繼續於衆院全會進行。政府方面似擬預定廿四日提出三與當之修正案，立即開始表決，而有以占絕對多數之與黨，强行通過之趨勢。又社會，民主，國協三與黨廿二日夜協議之後，決定於廿三日之衆院全會陸續提出經濟力集中排除法案及追加預算等重要法案，而欲一氣通過之。惟以自由黨爲中心之在野黨，則正考慮將其阻止之方策。再自由黨在廿二日午後七時起舉行之議員會議，認爲廿二日衆院全會之混亂，乃議長之責任，所議決之事項，法律上應屬無效，而決定追究松岡議長之責任。</p>
<h3>伊覆蘇抗議</h3>
<p>〔路透社德黑蘭廿三日電〕伊朗內閣今日討論蘇丹納總理所草簽蘇聯抗議書之覆文，據接近總理之人稱，伊政府之答覆曾駁斥蘇方抗議書中之各要點；　穌聯指蘇丹納不應遲至一年之後，始將石油協定提出國會。伊政府答以在此一年內並無國會存在，自出石油協定談判報吿而非伊政府之立法案。伊政府答以一九四四年十二月公布之伊朗法律，禁止官吏與外國談判權　讓與，故總理無權向國會提出立法案。　蘇聯指出英國在伊已享有油權，故伊朗對蘇實屬歧視。伊政府答以對英讓與汕權，係在伊朗尙無憲法之時，故無法徵求人民意見</p>
<h3>橫須賀等三港撥交美軍應用　美日均表熱烈贊成</h3>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿三日電〕美國衆院軍事委員會曾建議，一俟對日和約簽盯後，　須賀，佐世保及吳港　交與美國用作海軍基地·二十三白引間美國陸海重方面及日本方面，對此建　均　烈贊成。某海軍當局指出：橫須賀基地業已證明爲遠東海軍作戰最有價値之基地，目前已能供應整個艦隊之需要。橫須贊之美國化及民主化，對日本人士亦有重大影響，蓋此港多年來處於日本海軍秘密管制之下，戰前及戰爭中，日本人民多數均被擯棄於此地區以外。今則由美軍將其開放，並開始將此黯淡之地下城，轉化爲淸潔明朗之海軍基地。萬千日人正以此地按照美國標準而建設而自傲，且因基地之開闢，使數千日人有工可做，而該城之經濟狀態，亦得以轉危爲安。</p>

<h3>不識字點秋香</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日爲星期例假，且爲選舉之最後半日，各競選人圖作最後努力，故情况尤見緊張。各機關職員及公敎人員咸乘星期例假前往投票，故選民較前二日爲踴躍·各投票所於淸晨八時許即有大批選民前往投祟，至午始逐漸稀少。各區秩序尙佳，至十二時結束並無大纠紛發生。區域選舉昨日投票數約較第二日高出五成。西區一帶，棚戶甚多，昨晨相　赴投票所履行公民義務者甚衆，但因大多數不識字，只能在管理員協助之下，手點候選人名　之任何一人，而由他人代爲執筆塡寫選舉票。此種特別之選舉方法，學童呼之爲「點秋香」。敎育與民主關係之密切，發人深省。</p>

<h3>影院黃牛仍活躍「投我一票」</h3>
<p>本市各電影院，因「黃牛黨」之活躍，數度訂定罰則，以及會同警察常局大事捕捉，但終未獲得效果，每逢新片上映，活躍尤甚，而「黃牛黨」之神熊儀表，亦正以種種偽裝，避免警察耳目，時御麥爾登中山裝，儼若公務員然，排隊購票，或以請客式之態度當衆出售，前日起卡爾登及麗都戲院上映戰爭新片「　海蜂英烈傳」，連日觀衆擁擠不堪，「黃牛黨」竟大肆　斷，在塲塲客滿中，該「黨」幾將隔日戲院全部包盡，影迷徒勞排隊，最後仍請請敎「黃牛黨」「投我一票」，但無不切齒痛恨也。</p>
<h3>行總眞如廠組長錢錚福覆判無罪</h3>

<h3>筵席檢查尚多　明日開會討論　新雅窘辱少年警　將罰令停業數天</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕少年警察隊報行筵席簡約檢查以來，業有數日。社會局將於明日召開檢討會議，討論執行上之技術問題。記者昨訪若干少年警察隊員及該隊隊長胡邦偉，據稱：檢查工作開始以來，一般情形尙屬順利。大多數食客及店主對渠等之勸吿均能接受，僅日在新雅酒店發生不愉快之糾紛。因該店出售魚翅海參等奢侈食品，少年警察加以勸吿不聽，在檢查其冷藏間時，該店廚司茶役竟加以包圍，並將油粉塗上少年警之衣服。少年警欲打電話報吿局方亦被阻止。後經胡隊長及老閘分局得報，派員前往始能解園。現該主動肇事之七十三號茶役呂沛已由老閘分局處以拘役，新雅酒樓遠反節約，則已簽請主管當局將處以停業數天之懲罰。至於檢查時之主要困難在於若干法令之未盡完善或未能一致，例如：　關於海參魚翅等奢侈品，社會局曾有「存貨售完後不得再售」之規定，但存貨何時售完殊難查明，現時菜館所售者究係存貨抑係新貨寶難於判別。　小賬問題，社會局之規定係兩成堂彩外不得再有額外需索。但警察局　警法中則規定除正賬外不得有任何小賬。然則執行時究應以何者爲準。　節約筵席價格規定每桌不得超過一百二十萬元，每人不得超十二萬元，但有時一桌坐十一人或十二人，在此種情形下，每人十二萬元並不超過限度，但一桌總數則超渦限度矣。凡此種種，均爲執行時困難之點，將於明日會議中提出討論。少年警察現因警察局宿舍尙未有着落，故仍住於漕河涇敎養所中，每晨十時來市區，晚十時送返漕河涇。</p>
<p>（又訊）聞羅德記，馬樂記等四家廚房，經當局發現違反節約規定，將分別予以警吿。</p>

<h3>盲人敎育設施　未能適應社會</h3>
<p>一個盲人的回聲興無限悲戚　希望精神物質更多輔導援助</p>
<p>十一月十日本報特寫「全憑觸覺體認世界」一文，把事實來證明，我們盲人，憑　先天的資力，和後天的學力，所表演的能爲，並不遜於常人，促使社會注意於盲人敎育和事業的發展，以拯救我五百餘萬盲胞，都能得到廢物利用的機會。可是我們受過這種特殊敎育的盲人，能否爲現實社會所適應？寶有不勝難言之感！本報特寫所提出的宋關林，章培信，吳國彪三君，是中國盲人界的傑出者。宋君爲劉鴻生私人秘書，章君爲大美報編輯，他們都已年近花甲，都以英美文學與思想技能，爲他們的終身出路。吳君爲盲人界後起之秀，留美回國，倡導中華盲人學校。這個組織，能否得到政府與社會的同情，我想吳君的心裏，定有無限的悲感。</p>
<h3>歐美盲人　視同一體</h3>
<p>盲人敎育與事業，非經政府主持，社會輔導，斷難成效。如默美各國，都有盲人局與其福利團體的組織，有盲字册籍報紙的發行，特殊用具的供給，國民生活，視同一體，可是中國的盲人，那裏是這　！　了眼，學一個算命的，倒可以糊口過日，概使識幾個盲字，學些盲人的新技能，（如串藤，結網，音樂，打字等），反而連飯都吃不飽，甚或任憑你熟練職業技巧，精通歐美文學，却沒有人來請敎。這個癥結所在，固由於國家多難，民心不安，敎育設施，名不符寶，失業份子，有增無減，不能顧及我們這些廢物，而數十年來，盲人敎育的設施，未能適應於現實社會，要爲最大的失策，這問題實在相當嚴　。十年窗下不識之</p>
<h3>十年窗下不識之</h3>
<p>查識字敎育，爲敎育的基礎，文字爲生活的工具，歐美文字，都爲字母所構成，因此法國盲人brail氏所發明的點字，用一塊銅片，鑄成一個個方格，每格的模形，猶如　子面上的六點，就把一張紙片，用鐵筆從方格上打出凸點，因凸點的多寡與地位的參差，便能代表各個字母，我們憑着觸覺，撫摩着凸點，便認識那幾個字母所拚成的一個字，便能發出字普，懂得字義。至於我們中國的盲字，還是外國敎士所創造，最初北平的盲　學校，把所有的　音，　納爲四百零八個音母，後來上海等盲童學校根據注音字母　造，制定五十個字母，敎授盲人使用。殊不知中國文字，乃以六書爲體，而不以音，字母爲主，必須認識字體，然後能發出字明瞭字義，可是我們盲人，撫摩　幾點注音，十年窗下，畢竟還是不識之無，又怎能　認世界？</p>
<h3>能否改進盲人事業</h3>
<p>果然，這種「點形」的字，決計不能代表中國文字的形體，徒使我中國的盲人，讀了書，還不識字，可是今後的改進，能否以枓學方法，使我們盲人，除了能撫摩幾點注音以外，還能　撫摩着眞實的字體，一觸即覺，又除了能使用英文打字機外，還能使用中文打字機，再推而至於盲人事業的發展，從都市深入鄉村裏，像算命者一樣的普遍，這個重大的問題，我很高興追隨盲人界先進，如宋。章。吳諸君，努力於理想上的研究，同時還請求社會人士爲我們精神上與物質上的援助，庶不負本報「全憑觸覺、體認世界』的贊譽。（陸愼先）</p>

<h3>表妹玩弄手槍　義警慘被擊斃　砰然一聲　腦漿迸裂</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕現任新成警分局義警孫錫麟，年廿六歲，家住卞德路一九四七弄十四號，昨晨八時四十分，孫起床未久，適其年僅十二歲之表妹王三妹至孫室逗玩，因見枕下放有公事手槍一支，一時引起好奇心，取出玩弄，孫亦未加阻止，詎隔晚孫値勤時已將子彈登膛，王三妹年幼無知，未幾竟將機扭扳動，砰然一聲，子彈正擊巾孫之頭部，腦漿迸裂，立即倒地，王駭極狂呼，經家人到來，急召救護車送往醫院，卒以傷在要害，中途氣絕身死。新成警分局據報後，當派員赴出事地點調查，並將王三妹帶局似訊。</p>
<h3>天目路拆屋事件　居民訴苦的一般　公佈的拆費及諾言十之一</h3>
<p>〔本報特寫〕夭目路拓路拆屋事件，在上海市政上是一個相當惱人的問題。據天目路的居民說：居民代表向市參議會請願時，徐副議長面吿代表，市府預備　款九億協助拆遷，並且參會裏還有增撥七億償還地價的傳說，代表們回來轉述意旨，於是分期六個月拆遷的決定得到居民們的承諾了。但等到十一月十六日，工務局突然佈吿限期拆遷，在催迫領款的九千萬總數中，最低的拆遷費每戶祇有一萬二千元，這一來事情鬧僵了，請願，跪求，哭訴，以至終於喊出了「誰來拆屋，和誰拚命」的口號。據說所以致此的原因，間題完全在於公佈的拆遷費不及以前諾言的十分之一。營</p>
<p>業專靠火車旅客</p>
<h3>營業專靠火車旅客</h3>
<p>我們再看問題的另一面：倘是當局果俱履行參會傳說的條件，實撥拆遷費用十六億，天目路的居民是否就鴉雀無聲，遵命行事呢？要判斷這問題得先要認淸天目路的寶情：天目路這次被列入拆遷的房屋計共九十餘幢，約一百八十餘戶，這當中除普通住戶外，商店佔了六十戶，六十戶中香烟店九戶，是專做火車上鄕幫客人　發生意的；大小運輸公司十餘戶，無疑的也是和車站營業息息相關的；旅館近十戶，更毫無疑問的是把生命的源泉寄托在每天數十班火車旅客上面；其餘的飲食店，茶館不必說了。以這種近半數的居民在地利上和車站保持着密切的淵源來看，縱使有大量的費用補助，他們豈即甘願拆遷？「誓與住屋共存亡」的呼聲，必然地在他們當中喊出來了。</p>
<h3>含垢忍辱喘息甫定</h3>
<p>天目路上有不少住戶是有住居三十年以上歷史的。他們指出慶祥里從前曾住過一位李徽五先生，辛亥年他主持閘北發難時，光復的義職第一個在慶祥里豎起，並且發難前後起義同志都潛伏在慶祥里，常局如果緬懐先烈，崇德報功，這一塊地帶就不該拆；他們又說八年抗戰，天目路被敵人封鎖四年（淪陷時），居民念垢忍辱，閉門挨餓，期特天日重光，單憑這一點孤臣　子之心，當局也不該拆；他們又說八一三時天目路上不少房屋爲敵彈所燬，勝利後居民請求重建，當局准予就地造屋，並且爲他們舖水道，接電綫，現在市容方告整齊，他們也幸喘息稍定，當局怎忍心又下令拆除！</p>
<h3>北面佔路南面拓路</h3>
<p>說到這些理由，他們又提起兩路問佔地造壓的事件：天目路在舊租界時代稱「界路」，與新民路隔鐵柵欄相對，淪陷時敵人統治下的路局把房屋漸漸伸入新民路上，勝利後路局更大事營造，鐵柵欄雖經拆除，新民路則面目全非，本米比南京路還要寬暢的路面，現在已無復當年舊况，他們以爲責在路局，所以請願時特別提出了「北面佔路造屋，南面拆屋拓路」一點，問常局是何道理？</p>
<h3>煙廠感慨竟無例外</h3>
<p>天目路的地產，據說都是上海商業銀行，新華銀行，福源錢莊等所有，但他們對這次拆屋讓地事件，却並未表示態度。在拆屋行列中，最感到憤慨的是一家匯衆烟廠，他說我們每月的烟稅要繳納到八十億，對國家貢獻不能算小，但目前事迫眉睫，當局對他竟毫無例外；另外一家中和運輸公司，這次拆遷費應該領到六百○五萬元，算是天目路上是幸運的了，但據他統計拆遷損失將五十倍於這筆貼補的費用。</p>
<p>天目路的兩頭本來有兩座水泥堡　，租界時代居民們稱它爲「砲台」，現在是已成陳跡了。二十年來的幾次國難，這條路總是站在烽火的前列，很多房屋上現在還遺留着創痛的烙痕，將來果眞拆讓之議實現，這條路必將逐漸消蝕在上海市民們的記憶中了。</p>
<h3>擁車三百輛　闢綫十三路　交通公司慘淡經營　籌備慶祝二年紀念</h3>
<p>市公用局主辦之上海市公共交通公司　備委員會，近正　備該公司通車二週年紀念。緣該公司於卅四年九月問接收敵僞都市交通公司，加以整理，選出勉强可供行駛之破舊車輛五十一輛，於十二月十日先開行環城第一路路綫，慘淡經營，極盡艱苦，旋再擴展開闢第二三兩路綫，均賴員工上下一心，得以渡過難關。繼於卅五年四月間得交通銀行貨款，向物資供應局購得T二三四型道奇卡車一百輛，經該公司技術方面人員設計改裝，若干改成木質臨時車身，若千則改成今日在十路行駛之流綫型新型車輛，該公司遂得逐漸擴展業務。</p>
<p>迄目前止，已擁有車輛三百輛，其中流綫型新型車有六十一輛（二十輛在改裝巾，年底可竣工），　綫亦次第開闢至十三綫之多，每日乘客達廿萬人左右。現該公司擁有員工二千人，內行車人員達一千五百餘人，其餘爲技術方面及其他方面人員。福利設備十分完善，使員工可以安心工作。組織方面，由公用局趙曾珏兼任主任委負，其他工作人員如章名　·鈕澤全·吳錦慶·王總善·沈三多·張德慶·丁慰堂等，均係國內交通界知名人士。該公司高級人員每週有集會一次，策進業務進行，均由趙兼主任委員親自主持，廣納各單位意見，商策決定公司方針，充份實行民主化，聞該公司近日正　備增闢十四·十五兩綫，年內可以開行云。至下月十日慶祝通車二週年紀念，籌備已臻具體，有功員工，將分別頒發獎章，屆時將恭請吳市長親臨主持。</p>
<h3>靑年會舉行　義務領袖會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中華基督敎靑年會，每年一度之義務領袖會議，昨日上午九時假江蘇路中西女巾舉行。到會來賓吳貽芳，黎照寶，洪士深，張維等二百餘人。首舉行早晨祟拜，由國際宣傳協會美國辦事處主任德威廉講道。繼由金陝女大校長吳貽芳博士演講「中國基層建設與可年會」。下午繼續舉行會議，分「靑年道德與宗敎信仰」，「生產敎育與技術訓練」，「靑年健康與正當娛樂」，「民主敎育與合羣生活」，及「國際聯誼與世界和平」等五組，分別討論。各出席會員對該會今後工作，循此五項建議頗多，決由各界義務領袖協同該會共同推進。末由育才學校同學，表演我國民間音樂舞蹈，至六時許散會。</p>
<h3>六法警忠於職守查院長傳見勗勉</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市地方法院看守所法警武振岳，張開雲，戴如得，田順榮，蕭文彬，奚寒友等六人，於上月廿一日下午三時，由地院押解已決犯六十名往提籃橋上海監獄執行時，中途忽有犯人朱高金等三名躍車岡逃，經武等奮勇將該三犯追回擒獲，事聞於查良鑑院長，以該警等勤於職守，忠勇可嘉，特於昨日傳見，面予勗勉，並自本月份起各加薪一級，以資鼓勵。</p>
<h3>方志超受聘市政府顧問</h3>
<p>現任大衆夜報社社長方志超氏，原係宣鐵吾司令任市警局長時之行政處長，二年以來，對警政建樹良多。夏問以參加立法委員競選，依法辭去官職，主持大衆夜報，及義務警察事宜。現全市義警，已擴充至一萬五千餘名，協助職業警察，推行政府法令，厥功至偉，吳市長宣司令兪局長等，備極重視，吳市長並延聘方氏爲顧問，以備隨時諮詢云。</p>
<h3>郊區汽車非法搭客　當局正商取締辦法</h3>
<p>郊區長途汽車公司及市公共交通公司，因現有甚多客車，非法搭客，妨碍營業，特呈請市公用局予以取締。該局以非法搭客，大都以機關及團體爲背景，故頗難處理，刻正由警察局等各有機關，商討取締辦法。又市公用局以軍人乘車，輒不買票，據估計至少减少各交通公司之售票收入三分之一弱。該局爲顧及各公司之營業，維持開支起見，現正擬訂優待軍人乘車辦法，於短期內即可施行。</p>
<h3>思南路看守所巡禮　人多飯盒少吃成大問題　多數囚犯糊火柴盒度日</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕記者前日訪問思南路看守所，對該所概况擇要探誌於後：</p>
<p>看守所原爲前法租界監獄，落成於遜淸宜統三年，民國二十年改爲上海第二特區監獄，三十一年上海淪陷時期改爲僞「上海地方法院看守所」，三十四年九月勝利後接收，改稱今名。監房共三〇三間，男犯一，九三四名，女犯四四七名，外籍犯九名，幼年犯九一名，據統計，以</p>

<p>爲最多。每人每日兩餐，月大每日食米十七兩五，月小每日食米十八兩四，育菜每日四兩。外籍犯每人每日麵包二十八兩，洋山芋牛肉湯一碗。吃飯有一個很大的問題，兩千餘犯人，只有六百多個飯盒，以致輪到最後吃的人，飯菜都冷了。外籍犯比較受優待，有床舖，</p>
<h3>抽水馬桶</h3>
<p>謀殺余盛孝犯人却利阿却坐在床上看書。每一個監房內有一隻馬桶，有一個犯人拿他當優子，伏在上面寫字。每一個犯人，每星期准許接見家屬兩次。大部份犯人在糊火柴盒，熟練的每人每日糊五百隻，新犯人每日糊三百隻，不做工的</p>
<h3>要受懲罰</h3>
<p>在縫紉工塲內，以前有個已經開釋的鴻祥公司技工何子奎，因犯風化罪，　押看守所，衣服式樣做得很好。現在的工犯手藝，可差多了。談起這件事情，現在的看守還念他。看守所內犯人中有亡命之徒，即所謂「龍頭」，常常鬧事，遂將許立勳等六十餘人，移押上海監獄，上次上每監獄</p>
<h3>發生騷動</h3>
<p>也將龍頭施連根，周興龍等移押看守所，換了一個新地方，「龍頭」的威風也就施展不出來了。看守所內有規矩，女人不能進第三道鐵門，男人不能進女監，但新聞記者例外。謝部長曾請一位洋和尙「服保祿」到看守所內講道，是天主敎耶穌會司鐸，震旦大學敎授，講得一口流利的華語，手裏拿　　經，在每一個鐵窗前佈道，很熱心的樣子，據他說犯人信敎的不少。</p>
<p>祝福每一個犯罪的人，都能革面洗心，走進天——阿門！</p>

<h3>從上海道上饒</h3>
<p>— 唐渭濱</p>
<p>〔本報上饒廿日訊〕由江浙平原中心的上海，循滬杭，浙贛二鐵路綫，穿過杭，金。衢。廣。四屬的丘陝地帶，而達到鄱陽湖的湖沼地區，這其間方圓千里的一個廣闊富饒而帶有幽悶性的自然區域，早已由浙贛鐵路的興築，而與上海接近起來了。這個新動脈的重要地——上饒，從前是以軍事險要著名，現在却是握有經濟交通的樞紐而勃起復興，因此取有「小上海」的　號。「小上海」這一　號，從前是爲蘭谿所有，現在却、被上饒取而代之，因爲滬浙贛之間的大動脈，以前屬於廣信江與衢江，現在改隸於浙贛鐵路，所以衢獎合流的蘭谿，不得不把小上海這一譯號，讓給上饒了。這條大動脈，在抗戰期間，破壤比任何路綫爲甚，在復員初期，修復比任何路綫爲迅速，目前的沿綫治安亦比華北各路綫較爲安全，所以它雖在藍縷開疆的初期，却已萌蓬勃進取的氣象。在這晴朗爽快的深秋佳日，筆者由上海至杭州，轉金華赴江西上饒，仍由上饒至杭州返滬，特略述觀感如次：</p>
<h3>杭州一日留</h3>
<p>杭州是我國最美麗的城市，爲筆者舊遊之地，所有風景名勝，早都遊過，現時僅停留一日，本不想再出去遊覽。惟在杭應洽辦的公務，於上半日即很順利的辦妥，尙有大半天很優裕的時間，筆者四人在湖濱邊說邊行，本來僅爲散步性質，未想到信步淺行，已經到了外賓招待所門口，即進入參觀一遍，所內房舍潔整，庭園花木，蕭疏有致，大客廳適爲世界女靑年會會塲本日爲星期例假休會，因得進入會場參觀，四週佈置各國女靑年會團體活動照片，琳瑯滿壁，美不勝收。尤其主席台上放置特製的木魚，聞開會散會時，均敲不魚，以代搖鈴，實很別緻。</p>
<p>出了外賓招待所，仍是邊談邊走，我們又隨步到了昭慶寺，昭慶寺爲吳越王所建，向與靈隱，凈慈，鳳林稱湖上四大叢林，就外表而言靈隱似覺莊嚴雄壯，就內部而觀，昭慶因爲建築於湖濱平曠之區，所以比靈隱之傍山闢寺者，更爲氣象開闊。寺巾有戒壇，千佛閣，藏經閣，定觀閣，觀音井，看山亭，臥牛石諸名勝。且有多數可珍貴之刻石，嵌諸牆壁，尤爲古剎生色不少。寺門前有淸蓮池（俗稱放生池），池上有萬壽橋，寺前古樹繁茂，環境幽雅，寺屋在淪陷期間，僅損壞一部份，勝利初爲軍隊借駐，現軍隊調防，所餘房屋爲浙贛路局借作負工訓練所之用。本日爲例假休課，我們便得隨便到各處看看，課堂，宿舍，飯廳等，雖然用具很簡單，但處處都是很整齊淸潔，表現一種蓬勃的朝氣。據稱在這裏受訓的，都是招考而來的下級幹部，車務，機務均各有數班，車上的服務生亦在此受過嚴格訓練。華者聯想過去往來於侯家源兄所主持下的黔桂鐵路，所有車上服務生對於旅客服務的週到與有禮貌，現時便可以推料到浙贛路車上的服務生，當然是具同樣服務精神，將來浙贛路業務的發展，是有賴於遂批訓練出來的人員。</p>
<h3>由杭到金華</h3>
<p>筆者於淸晨到杭州城站，乘七時十分一次對號特快車赴金華，於下午一時三九分準點到達，此段僅一百八十五公里，較滬杭段爲稍短，而行車時間達六小時半，從表面看似覺較爲慢點，事實上路局是已盡了最大的力量，因爲這原是一件很難能的工作。這一段路並不是像京滬路的一片平原，而是丘陵地帶，坡度灣道均較大，並非甲等路綫標準，在抗戰期間，破壊又相當嚴　，杭諸間是破壤後由日人草率修復，諸金間橋樑毀損殆盡，各站站屋設備，也十分之九是被毀去了。至於軌道，電綫，機重房，給水站等完全被拆毀，僅路基尙大致保存。以破壊這樣慘重，能於短時間修復通車，自然不是易事，至行車方面，杭諸間以路基不甚鞏固，爲求安全起見，行車自不能過快，諸金間係原來路基，快車自較快，與滬杭段相差無幾，不過經過重新修復的橋樑，仍須行慢車，自較爲安全。筆者利用若干地方行車較慢，而大站停留較久的機會，藉以流覽沿綫風景及觀察各種情况。</p>
<p>當火車由杭州城站開出，很快的使過了南星橋站而抵江邊，即緩緩地駛經錢塘江大橋，錢塘江的波濤和江山的峰巒，處處給人以一種雄壯的快感，六和塔屹立於江邊，其附近爲之江大學校舍，崇樓傑閣，倒影江中與朝霞波光相映射，尤覺美麗。當車經過橋上時，便聯想到老友茅以昇兄當時設計建築這座大橋，他的學問，技術，經驗和毅力，在現今工程界實不可多得，使人和乘平綏路車經過靑龍橋時對詹佑天先生有同樣的崇拜。經渦蕭山站時停車時間稍多一點，　者便下車到站隨便看看，蕭山原爲文化很高的縣份，物產豐裕，地方富足，雖經刧後，而縣治以至鄉鎭間建築物仍很整齊。距站僅三公里的湘湖，在站上稍高處和車上均可望見，車站有河道可通至湖，湖週圍約二十餘公里，作葫蘆形，環湖多山，峯巒嵯峨，風景至佳勝；惜車不停地前進，湖的形狀便逐漸消失了。諸暨爲絕代美人西施的故鄉，這裏名勝古蹟至多，苧蘿村，西龍潭，涼風洞等以距站較遠，無從眺覽；僅五洩山的勝概隱約可以望望而已。車經蘇溪時，水環山複淸流激湍，風景如畫，自義烏至金華，田間蕎麥一片銀花，隨風鼓浪；而田滕及山隈均是棗樹和烏柏樹棗樹經霜後，落葉將半，更覺枝條蕭疏有趣，烏柏經霜後，大部份葉是紅透了，尙有一部份是由綠而黃，柏十又是白粒粒像珍珠般嵌在樹梢；在陽光映射下，一片艷紅中，襯託着白，黃，綠等顏色，尤爲美麗。筆者因爲欣賞沿綫的景色，不覺得有絲亳的疲倦，同時也不覺行車速度的稍慢。</p>
<h3>金華兩日遊</h3>
<p>筆者一行兩人於第一日下午一時三十九分到金筆，於第三日仍乘杭饒直達的一次車離金赴上饒，在時間上計算是足足兩日。金華的城區以至北山都曾到過，金華在抗戰期間二十九年至三十二年空前的繁榮，當時上海所有運入內地的物資，均集中到金華再轉人後方的自由區域；許多東南淪陷區的人士也紛紛經過金華轉入內地；由戰前僅有五六萬人口，突增加至二十餘萬人口，自然像暴發戶般突來的財富，不知怎樣享用，而浙省軍政首腦也都駐在金華，當時成爲東南各地的交通，經濟，軍事政治的中心地，這是有史以來的黃金時代，可是不久金華的繁榮便隨戰略轉變而消矢了。勝利後兩年來，經地方當局的努力，金華以前在淪陷期間破壊的情况，雖大部份修復，新建造的市房很整齊，街道很淸潔，可是過去的繁榮是巳過去了。火車雖然是可通杭饒，但以　港——金華江的沙灘擁塞，水運未盡暢通，火車與帆船聯接的運輸，便爲蘭谿所取面代之。經濟商業便不得不日趨沒落，現時以商業的不振，縣城人口僅有四萬餘，政費支絀，原駐金華的專員公署因而撤消歸併於　縣，浙東區政治上的領導地位亦隨之消失了。但是金華文化向來是非常高，由南朝時許謙，宋時呂祖謙，明初宋濂而至淸時李淸照，鄭剛中等均有很輝煌的藝文作品遺留着，現時敎育是較爲發達，省立，舊金屬八縣聯立，縣立及私立的中等學校，計有七校之多，而國立英士大學校址，又確定設在金華，加以北山泉　俊秀，岩洞瑋奇，實爲鐘毓人才的勝地。筆者盡一日的時間至北山考察，深覺北山三洞的天然奇勝，如能配以人工佈置——修築道路，建造房舍，以利車輛交通，游人休憩，每年吸收遊覽的利益，足以繁榮一切；北山岩洞甚多，以三洞爲最著稱；所謂三洞者即朝眞（上洞）　壺（中洞）雙龍（下洞）三洞。雙龍洞是洞中有洞，遊人要臥在小艇進裏洞，裹洞內四壁琳瑯盡爲鐘孔岩石，肖各種形態；冰壺洞則洞內有巨瀑十丈，自頂懸空而下，轟雷飛珠，至爲奇觀，朝眞洞　豁深遂，幹洞有天池，一綫天，支洞有龍潭等勝。金華名勝至多，詳細情况，今後當另專文述之。</p>
<h3>上饒的一瞥</h3>
<p>者由金華乘下午一時四十就分一次車，於夜二十三時準點到上饒，在車上沿途所見情形，當另於由饒返杭時再述。筆者在饒住兩夜，有足足一日的時間在上饒考察，雖然是走馬看花，上饒輪廓尙有相當的認識。</p>
<p>上饒縣城在信江的北面，是前淸的廣信府治城周　九里，有六個城門，南門和大西門最繁盛，大西門外大街，尤爲平俎，大西門城牆經拆去一部份，闢爲商塲，城壕滿種荷花，壕邊楊柳成列，風景殊不錯，上饒全縣有二千三百方公里，二鎭二十八鄉，三十他萬人口，七十八萬畝田地，出產有米，　　，夏布，藥，茶，油，姜黃等。信江有三浮橋通南岸，信任書院在南岸高台上，風景極佳，現爲省立上饒中學校址，實爲絃歌勝地。離城西北三十餘公里有靈山，七十二峯綿互一百多里，由東北有一孤石憑空挺立，名爲石人峯，山上有龍池，頗多奇木珍草，又產水晶，勝蹟至多，惜以路稍遠，未及前往遊覽，惟在城郊遠眺，峯　疊翠，足　仰止約情趣。</p>
<p>上饒爲現時浙贛兩省物資交流的中心，這完全靠浙贛鐵路與信江水陸運輪發生聯擊的作用。信江爲江西省境內亞於贛江的第二大河流，信江本稱上饒江，俗稱信河。廣信府自唐到元朝，都稱信州，信江的名，便由此得來。信江由玉山縣起點西流至洪瑞鎭，入鄱陽湖長六百八十五里。信江雖發源於玉山縣懐玉山，惟流至上饒縣水始深，約有一丈多深，爲最好的泊船地方。又於縣城南會合由廣豐縣來的河水，再西八十里到河口鎭又會合鉛山縣來的河水，所以稱爲河口，由此而西，經弋陽，貴溪，餘江，餘干等縣而至洪瑞鎭入鄱陽湖，信江所經過的地方，爲江西省富饒之地，現時這些地方輸　品如米，茶，烟葉等，均集由於上饒，由浙贛路運出杭滬等地，而由滬杭等地轍入信江流域的監，布疋，洋什等貨，又集中在上饒分發。上饒現時的繁榮就寄託在上面。此外上饒的風俗很淳厚，人民很樸實，生活上最主要的米，魚，肉，蔬菜均很便宜；氣候也很正常是內地中較富裕而安定的地方。可惜因靠近貴溪，一般人民較爲迷信而已。</p>
<h3>浙贛路車廂</h3>
<p>筆者本擬由上饒赴南昌，適以原定汽車臨時有點障礙，遂決定仍由上饒逕返杭州，計早晨七時零五分乘二次特快車，由上饒開行，於夜十時五十分準時到達。在車上將近十六小時。以三百八十八公里的里程，特快車行車時間需要這樣長，似覺稍嫌過慢，惟以事實的特殊困難，有此成就，已是不易，關於杭州至金華一段的情形，經在上文略述，茲就饒金一段工程及行車情况略爲記述。</p>
<p>衢縣到金華一二〇公里戰時戰後先後修復通車，路基橋梁均較爲穩固，金華到衢縣雖僅八十二公里，但因此段有金華江，靈玉港，下山溪，上山溪，東　江等五大橋，損失情形慘重，修復工程浩大，各橋經本年二月間興修，日夜趕工，經三個多月將橋座工程，先後完成，惟所需全部鋼樑，須自英美訂製，難以應急，不得不改變計劃，將金華江先建木拱架橋，靈山港東蹟江先建木桁架橋，上下山溪以舊工字梁及方木先行架設通車。當火車駛過這五座大橋時，爲求安全起見，須緩緩前進，筆者田車窗俯視橋墩重建工程及臨時架設便梁通車，不得不佩服橋工人員的設計精巧，於無辦法中想出辦法，以此原故，自然不便歸咎行車稍緩。</p>
<p>現時鐵路所需機車車輛和一切重要器材，大部份仰賴外國，惟輸入至不易，所以無論行車及工程方面，在在無不感受到器材的困難。浙贛鐵路在這極端困難的環境中提前分段通車，筆者此次所乘的客車，雖是低鉤，缺少鋼版，不免震動，但這是浙贛鐵路機廠所自造的，在器材困難的現在，這一點又是一件不易的事</p>
<p>浙贛鐵路現時列車的電力，不是　機車行動時附帶發電，而是另有一輛車廂裝置柴油發電機發電，每於早晨天未亮以前及黃昏後，列車電燈明亮像白天一般，便利一般旅客在車廂閱置書報。　者此次十六小時在車廂中，白天流　沿綫風光，黃昏後便閱　靑報，如此便不覺得時間過於長。</p>
<p>車上服務生對於旅客很有禮貌，茶水照料頗週到，車廂時時打掃很清潔。至列車中附設　車，炒飯，湯飯，雖較簡單，惟頗清潔。</p>
<p>基以上數點，　者整整十六小時中，對浙贛鐵路當局從艱難困難中求進步的精神，至爲欽佩，並預感最近的將來必有很大的改進。</p>
<h3>假軍官詐財張寶芝再度就擒　上海姑娘遊錫被騙金戒兩枚</h3>
<p>〔本報無錫廿二日訊〕湖南賓慶人張賓芝，年十八歲，僑居　陽西門後街，前在南京衛。司令部充當列兵，本年九月間，因冒充軍官，在錫招搖撞驅，會被北區憲兵補獲，轉解指揮所，拘禁十天從釋放。惟張不知悔過自新，竟仍逗留旅館，施其騙術，最近認識上海來錫遊玩之沈姓女子，騙取金戒兩枚，逃逸無踪。本月二十日，張出現於火車站，身踪軍服，並佩少校梅花肩軍，持用中央訓練團第十七軍官總隊學員何其　符號，假借軍官身份，强購車票未遂，致與售票員發生爭吵，當被車站憲兵拘獲，帶隊訊究，張直認冒充軍官，詐騙財物不　，並在其身畔搜出原贓金戒二枚，廿二解軍繁稽查處訊辦。</p>
<h3>常州盜匪好大胆！刦罷酣酒高臥飄然呼嘯而去</h3>
<p>〔本報武　廿一日訊〕本）邑一區附郭茶山　游兩鄉十五十六日連續發生巨刦案，匪徒給夥行刦，多至二十餘人，肆無忌憚。先十五日深夜，茶山鄉楊家村，到有匪盜多人，口操　　，服裝長短不一，携帶長短槍，至村先佈崗放哨，然後　開村民楊洪英吳茍大等家，挨戶搜刦，雞米鴨衣服，悉行掠去，匪盜來去從容，全村損失不貲。又能游鄉張　橋村，於十六日晚十時許，突來盜匪十餘人，携帶長短槍，先後至薛惠生等家逐一洗刦，幷將附近居民五六人細綁一處。刦後，復在一小酒店中交杯狂飲二時許，飲後復在該處酣睡二時許，旋爲鄉民發覺，嗚鑼呼救，盜始呼嘯逸去。查該鄉平時素安寗，此次縣府將自衛隊集中整編，調駐他處，致鄉民毫無保障，蒙受損失，與情鼎沸。</p>
<h3>蘇州冬令救濟費慷慨認捐達八億</h3>
<p>〔本報蘇州廿一日訊〕蘇州冬令救濟運動籌備工作，積極展開，廿一日不午組成救濟委員會，原定募款五億元，當日各委員即分別慷慨認捐，總計可達八億元。又訊：本縣太湖地區淸剿指揮所，連日派隊出動。西華。長豐。石帆。東渚四鄉鎭冬防聯合辦事處業已組織成立，決於日內展開擴大搜剿。</p>
<h3>天堂民主第二課</h3>
<p>〔本報杭州廿二日訊〕在杭州市民所學習的民主課本上，有過一次民選市參議員，這次國民代表大選，應該是第二課了。</p>
<p>國民代表大選，在杭州這地區上，先由提名競選，再到向中央競圈候選人，以區域來講，祝紹周圈中厚又放棄，李楚狂由弄回後補一躍而被圈爲區域正選，這個　變距離大選前僅兩天，還有一位女代表候選人姜梅英圈定後交給選舉事務所距離選舉前僅半天功夫，這樣的忙迫自然有許多地方顯得格外的緊張，在黨部裏，在選舉事務所辦公室裘，實際負責的人眞有枵腹從公的。</p>
<h3>李楚狂公開宣傳</h3>
<p>廿一日侵晨，街上還是靜靜地，各家商店掛出了國旗，李楚狂候選人在公共汽車上貼滿了「請投一票」的標　，湖濱一帶，每根柱子上都是「請投李楚狂一票」在各馬路上，大的紅紙招也寫着「請投李楚狂一票」。聽說另外幾位候選人，却在埋頭努力，整個杭州市，只有李楚狂是公開的宣傳拉票，但是只有李楚狂一人，似乎不够熱鬧。也許其他競選者因爲節約紙張的關係，所以也不必做宣傳了。到第二夭，才又有黨負簽署合格的候選人朱承德也在汽車上大貼標語：「提倡民主，要公開自由競選」。</p>
<h3>大卡車分載選民</h3>
<p>各處投票區，當以市商會的爲最富麗堂皇，一進大門，即見大紅綢上綴着很大的「請一致擁護金潤泉先生爲國民大會代表」的金字。那裏有許多商人在投票，情緒上看來很愉快。至於熱鬧的情形，當以工會的投票所爲最，那是一輛輛大卡車載着一羣羣選民來投票的。</p>
<h3>映電影招徠選票</h3>
<p>敎育會的投票所在該會的樓上，該所主任說：「星六下午預備放映電影一塲，歡迎敎育界選民參觀，但事前必須投票」。許多區域投票所也在想盡方法使選民投票，看起來似較選舉市參議會的塲面來得安靜些，秩序的確是很好，也沒有什麽纠紛。</p>
<h3>候選人名單弄錯</h3>
<p>有許多投票所裏揭露的候選人名單，有些地方弄錯了，例如工礦團體候選人陳其業（勤士），列在中央提名之內，而又把陳勤士列在簽署登記之中。又如技師內靑年黨提名的有一人，其人係土木工程師，而却寫成靑年黨提名的有二人，一人名爲「土木科」。　婦女投票所內，幾位婦女領袖在圍長桌細談，投票所職員說：「她們有的投了票走了，有的投了票正在休息。」</p>
<h3>投票所紙條之謎</h3>
<p>有一個投票所設在　勇警察中隊部，但因爲該隊部新糊牆壁，便將投票所的紙條貼在「義警中隊部」的木牌後面，有的人找不着投票所，問警察在那裏？警察說「在這裹！」投票所的職員趕忙出來把木牌翻轉來，但不多一回，又變爲義警中隊部了。</p>
<p>選舉進行中，市長周象賢曾發覺一個人投四票，於是立加斤　。有的人請人投「×××」票一票，以請客一次爲報酬，有的人到處奔走，請求投票，說成功以後，一定有所報謝。</p>
<h3>兩黨員資格動搖</h3>
<p>在杭州這天堂裏，看這一次的大選，可以以記者在五月初訪問市臨參議會負責人的話來做結論，就是：「杭州自比不得上海，上海够熱烈的，但杭州總是沉着鎭定的，這就是代表堅毅與純樸。」如果以這一個結論來說明這次天堂的大選，可以說是又進步一次了。</p>
<p>在大選的期中，國民黨黨部事是特別緊張的，他們時常指揮黨員放棄競選，否則就開除黨籍和取銷資格。截止記者寫稿時止，浙江省黨部已經呈請中央開除黨籍的有二個人了。</p>
<p>總之，這次大選，當然都是在學習中做去，所以一切都是比較生疏，但在生疏之中，到底還看得出一點熱烈的情緒。（特派員儲　生）</p>
<h3>香港僑胞建議修改路名撤銷中國街</h3>
<p>〔本報香港廿一日訊〕港九居民聯合會最近向港府建設在門牌上加上街名，這是一個劃時代的改革，港府已採納並且開始寶行了，以後國內來港的人，找朋友將比前容易得多。居民聯合會以「增進中英友誼」爲理由，還打算向港府達議把香港九龍若干條馬路，改以中國名人的名字爲名，這個建議似乎不容易實現，至少在現階段是如比。港九兩地的街道，以我國省份的名字爲名者有之，以我國大城市的名字，爲名者有之，但以我國名人的名字爲名者，則迄未之有。但除了一條「上海街」外，以我國省名城市名爲名的街道，不是偏僻一隅的，就是短狹的，比之所謂「皇后大道」，「德輔道」，「彌敦道」，「太子道」等，簡直　乎其後！香港最熱鬧的中環區，有一條「中國街」，英文呌Chinese　St，譯意即「唐人街」，這條街，是中環區售道中最狹窄，（不能駛汽車），最骯髒，（中間是溝渠）最陳舊的。但不知爲了什麼緣故，港府的「官定譯文」，竟呌牠是「中國街」，港中的僑胞大家都異口同聲說，這條街實在不該取上這個名字，應予撤消才好。（特約記者于健）</p>
<h3>成渝鐵路永川內江兩段短期即可動工</h3>
<p>〔本報重慶廿日訊〕成渝鐵路永川。內江兩總段土石方的工程，已於日前舉行投標，短期內即興工。法工程師費義友（MFeyaux）對本報記者談：「該路工程部份進展極快，如果中法簽約成功，法國器材源源接濟，重慶至內江一段，迅可築成。」可是，究竟什麽時期，能够完成簽約手續，中法當局諒莫如深，沙班銀團亦無三度來華消息。</p>

<h3>一個兒童敎育問題　怎樣使小孩子不哭</h3>
<p>— 陳鶴琴</p>
<p>今天的講題是「怎樣使小孩子不哭」。</p>
<p>小孩子與成人不同。小孩子高興的時候便會天眞地笑，逢到不如意的時候就會放聲大哭。不過哭的多了，大人固然討厭，就是小孩子自己也很吃虧。現在我們要硏究的是小孩子爲什麼常常要哭，我們有什麽方法可使他不哭。</p>
<p>哲學家對小孩子的哭有兩種說法。一種說小孩子的哭很好聰，甚至比如天上的音樂。一種說小孩子的哭就是抗議，是反抗這萬惡世界的呼聲；盧梭也曾經這樣說過。我們且撤開這些。照生理上來講，小孩子的哭也是必然的現象。譬如小孩子在胎兒時期，肺是扁平的，還沒有起呼吸作用，一生下來，就要靠哭來擴張肺部的。所以這個時候小孩子的哭，是能決定存亡的一個重要的關鎚。</p>
<p>此後小孩子與哭還是有着密切的關係。因爲他如不哭，還是有生命的危險。但問題就在這裏：小孩子爲什麼一定要哭呢？什麼緣故要哭？現在根據我的經騐，認爲小孩子由於生理上的緣故而哭的可分爲七種</p>
<p>第一種是「餓」。小孩子在餓的時候就會哭，他如不哭，就不能生存；哭是他唯一的武器。我們要使小孩子不哭，就要讓他按時進食。</p>
<p>第二種是「痛」。小孩子碰撞了身體，或因別的東西觸痛了他，他也會哭的。關於這點，做父母的更應注意，必需隨時保護檢點。</p>
<p>上面所講的兩種，一般人都知道。我也不再詳述。下面的五種未必盡人皆知。所以特意提出來，供大家參考。</p>
<p>第三種是「渴」。我曾經親眼見過一個四歲的小孩子，面孔瘦得簡直不像樣子，並且整天哭不離口，常時我覺得奇怪，就去問他的母親，再從他的生活中去觀察。哦！原來這個孩子自生下來以後，從沒喝過開水。我們要知道，小孩子與大人一樣，也需要喝水。人乳雖然有水分，但所含極微。所以我們應照吃乳時間，每吃過兩次奶，要給他喝一次開水，至於早晚，也是少不了的。因口渴而不得水喝，也是要哭的。</p>
<p>第四種是「冷」。小孩子冷了也要哭的。做父母的應隨時注意，應隨時給他增添衣服。　第五種是「熱」。小孩子熱了也要哭的。不過這個「經騐」是從我的小孩子那裏禪來。有一次搬家，我抱了小孩子坐在車上，因爲是暑天，太陽又猛烈，我就用傘替他遮着，那知他一路上總是不斷的哭，我就奇怪，過去坐過車子，他是不哭的，這是什麽緣故呢？但一到家裏，他就不哭了。原來小孩子也很怕熟，也很怕强烈的太陽光，後來我又幾次試騐，都證明了這個哭的原因。</p>

<h3>征軍臨別失蹄馬華敗於華聯　四比二表演緊張精彩慈善賽球迷人山人海</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕馬來亞聯華足球隊昨日臨去秋波，於下午三時在逸園與本市東華靑白合組之華聯隊作征滬臨別戰，球迷震於馬華之球藝，千載一時，傾巷而來，榮譽座，特別座，普通座，全部客滿，人山人海，水洩不通，約計當有二萬人左右，在一球勝負之時，爆竹之聲，響澈雲霄，本季初見盛况。難童敎養院樂隊奏樂助興，四維　軍會同軍　，維持秩序，尙稱良好。</p>
<h3>全運會決賽縮影</h3>
<p>經九十分鐘之劇戰，華聯隊以戰略上之勝利，四比二壓倒馬華，上半時三比零，華聯獲得意外之大勝。比賽緊張精彩，無以復加，淸脆迅速，絕無片刻停留，勢均力敵，實爲上海星洲全運會決賽之縮影。</p>
<h3>馬華隊致命之傷</h3>
<p>華聯之勝，大出一般球迷意外。實則表演確有特殊之精彩，後衛中衛遠較馬華爲强，使馬華進攻受挫，而張林根之死釘謝文良，梅潤華之受傷下塲，尤爲馬華致命之傷。身材矮小，亦爲馬華之美中不足。前鋒後衛，全部陷於牛身不遂不能聯絡之境。下半時之反攻，已爲時太晏。球運不佳，亦有原因，李以銀旣失去十二碼，夏體先必中之球，恰中橫木，殆有天意。反觀華聯守衛綫之佳無論矣，前鋒韓龍海李垚，尤有難以形容之妙，勝負蓋在是矣。</p>
<h3>華聯隊氣壯山河</h3>
<p>比賽於三時一刻開始，裁判何春軍，巡　陳吉祥吳守衡，華聯攻勢頻頻，聯華大受威脅，二分鐘時聯華梅潤華被　林銀　　　　，　　　　入代，十分鎭時，張國興救駕心切，禁區手球，被判十二碼，孫隊長操刀，應聲而入，滬隊首開紀錄。爆竹齊鳴，歡聲雷動。四分鐘後、龍海中路挺進，冷箭突施，朱志成未防此着，目送入綱，華聯連獲二球，氣壯山河。聯華五鋒反攻，但滬隊攻守嚴密。，難渡天　。四十分鐘時，瞿永福禁區猛撞夏體先，聯華李以耀主罰十二碼，竟過門不入。華聯大難不死，後福又來，四十四分鐘時，李垚得永福派司，三十碼外遠射，恰到好處，直飛網角。前半結東，華聯三比〇先導。</p>
<h3>四比二最後勝利</h3>
<p>兩陣再　，客軍以劉風昌調在右翼，夏體先任中鋒原職，下馬施威，攻勢猛烈。七分鑛時，夏體先落後帶球，小傳前鋒，胡文相於離門卅五碼處遠射，高而且急，邦綸躍救，角度稍差，遂吿失陷。三比一，萬華扳回一城，士氣驟振，華聯腹地，備遭蹂躪。幼良下野，明哲登塲，雙方互相攻守，均難得手。直至卅五分鐘時，胡文相單槍匹馬，近門力射，邦綸不防·球又入網，三比二差一球。吳祺祥脚傷離塲，約二分鐘後再入，戰至終塲前七分鐘，陳明哲邊陲起義，闖過三關，陳家萬失職，小外甥建立功勳，四比二華聯　定最後勝利。未幾，金鳴眾收，華聯以四比二破馬來亞聯華，報復吉隆坡一箭之仇。雙方陣容如下：</p>
<p>華聯張邦綸　李義臣　吳　祥　韓認波瞿永福張林機</p>
<p>聯華朱志成　陳家萬　張國與　楊嘉松　李以耀　巫錦成　關順德　謝文良　梅潤華　夏體先　胡文相　劉風昌　上下</p>

<h3>自備外匯進口物資　收購審議會今成立　並由國行張總裁召開第一次會議</h3>
<p>自備外匯進口物資收購審議委員會，籌備迄今，大致就緒，該食定於今日下午一時，在外灘中央銀行會議室，舉行成立會。並召開第一次會議，由中央銀行總裁，兼中信局理事長張嘉　，負責召集。參加之單位，除中央銀行及中央倌託局外，尙有輸出入管理委員會，經濟部，海關，審計部等。會中討論之主題，爲確定收購細則，及討論收購價格。進口商方面對該會之成立，極表關懐云。</p>
<h3>華商鋼精廠函輸管會請直接分配輸入限額</h3>
<p>外商華鋁劍精廠，在本年二月問，趁上海各鋼精廠尙未有同業公會組織之機會，囑該廠華籍高級職員，分別通知源昌，友聯，良工，亞洲，上海，公用，　光，聖業祥等華商廠家，致函輸管會限額分配處，請求增加華鋁外匪配額，俾各廠可向華鋁多購鋁片等語。各廠信以爲真，即分別函請限額分配處，照華鋁所屬各節辦理。華鋁因此得配到外匯，佔鋁額全數百分之六十三，共計一，二，三季所得鋁錠爲一千六百餘噸，其已到滬之第一季鋁錠爲五百餘噸。</p>
<p>但據查華鋁轉售與各華商鋼精廠之鋁片，自木年三月至十一月止，除與該廠接近之勤昌，惠昌，兩廠外，其餘總數僅有二十七噸牛，故一輩代爲寫信，請求增加華鋁配額之各廠，大爲憤激，除已組織同業公會，請求限額分配處，直接分別配給外，並請調查華鋁廠，自本年三月至十一月間，分售與各華商廠鋁片之數量，請增加華商各廠第四季之配額，並直接分配。現鋁業公會，已將各會員廠之意見，全部核轉輸管會辦理矣。</p>
<h3>調整捲烟稅辮法尙在縝密硏討中</h3>
<p>本市捲於工廠，以捲烟生產，成本日高，而尤可慮者，銷路未能盛大展開。以各地交通之阻滯，且烟價趨漲，又致影響職買力薄弱之吸戶，故對捲烟稅之調整，實有不勝負担之年苦。</p>
<p>日前貨物稅署王科長，曾召集本市烟廠界，在貨物稅局，共同硏究合宜之調整稅顆辦法。據悉：烟廠界以屢屢調整稅率，實爲增重廠方之成本，然政府之稅收，又須顧及，故特向當局建議，除合理之調整捲烟稅額外，另行研討適宜之辦法，以增加政府之稅收，免刺激烟價，而影響銷路。至將以如何之方式而增加稅收，現在研討中，或將發動普遍之增加捲烟生產云。</p>
<h3>台灣美菸到滬</h3>
<p>台灣省之美種烟葉，以品質佳美，前經本市烟葉商界函請台灣當局輸滬，以供國產捲烟之用，然該省公賣局以台省烟業產量不豐，僅足自給，設有剩餘，再行運銷外省。然自上月公賣局運滬美種台烟三十萬磅，直接售於外商頤中烟公司穢，台省烟葉僅足自給之謎，已屬打破。且最近市上另有合灣烟葉之發現，據稱，此項烟葉，爲自台灣走私而來，較國產同等之烟葉低廉約三四成左右。</p>
<p>捲菸盤降</p>
<p>昨日捲菸市况，因各廠不斷派貨，同業頭寸軋緊，進意閑散，浮多了吐，價乃盤低。惟近收見低，有人搜吸，市况微回。結果十支大英烟，比上日札跌四十萬元，爲二千四百二十萬元，老刀亦小卅五萬元。</p>
<p>全日趨勢，除廿支南未及五十支小三砲克來文微見上升外，其餘條烟各降一千至三千元，銀行牌南洋公司有派配，吐售甚多，軋小七千元之巨。</p>
<p>又訊；聞收盤後，塲外老刀烟走勢轉佳，價提高一千八百八九十萬有人買進。</p>
<h3>日本賠償物資　首批下月中到滬</h3>
<p>日本賠償我國物資，現已由行政院通知航業界，準備派船隻赴日橫須賀裝運返華，並於十二月一日，在滬招商局召開督運會議。交通部國防部經濟部敎育部及資源委員會等，均派代表出席，商討首批物資。「日木第十九。</p>
<h3>人絲日內恢復配售　停配三期全數補配　製成品印度等地銷路頗佳</h3>
<p>關於人造絲之配售間題，據絲織業公會負責人談，社會局之調查工作，日內可望完成，大約本月廿七日可以恢復復配售，中信局已停配三期，故將於此次配售時，全部補配。</p>
<p>近日人造絲已由日本運到二千箱，每次配售之總額，爲二百餘箱，則三期集中配售僅共六百餘箱，所餘尙多，人造絲價在最近期內，不致再起任何波動云。</p>
<p>又我國之人造絲製成品，目前在中東波斯印皮等地，銷路極佳，頗受當地人民歡迎。最近絲織品聯營公司，又有數百匹綢縀運銷各地區云。二十兩工廠，」機械器具四百五十一部，由日本橫須賀港啓運。</p>
<p>據悉：二此次討論中，對運貨及各部會推派代表在滬成立接收機構，以僅機械工具裝滬後，立刻分配，不致擱　太久。對上海碼頭倉庫工作，亦作詳細商討。督運委員會代表陳士金，定於廿六日由滬乘機飛日，一切出國手續，業經麥帥總部批准，轉知外交部。故首批物資到埠日期，大致不致有悮，十二月中旬即可到滬</p>
<h3>港織造業回甦棉紗供應不足</h3>
<p>〔香港航訊〕本港織造業已吿回甦，棉紗之供應，極感不敷。　官方人士　　，　來由於外地訂貨增加，木港織造業經一洗過去數月來之式　狀態，因之對棉紗之需要，遂日益增加。</p>
<p>本港工商供應處處長裘伯惠赴東車之行，即爲治商增加日紗供應事宜。根據目前情形，木港每月所需數量，實不足以應付，查目下本港織布業製造棉布所需之十號紗，市面甚缺乏，至日前所傳說關於滬紗三千包運抵本港一事，據有關方面稱，需五日後始行決定，所傳已抵港之說不確。</p>

<p>日用品肥皂，以交易平淡，固本皂軋小一萬五千元，箭刀祥茂牛牌皂等，各跌一萬元左右。洋燭軋升二萬元，火柴堅疲不一</p>
<h3>日貨紙圈四萬盤　中信局定期配派　派價每盤五十萬元較市低廉</h3>
<p>中央信託局前向日易回之日貨「富士川」脾紙圈八萬五千圈，已於前二月配木市各捲烟廠應用。第二批之五萬圈，現亦經中信局委託中華烟公司辦理分配事宜</p>
<p>茲悉：本期之五萬圈，本市各大小烟廠共得四萬圈，外埠各地烟廠共得一萬圈。此項紙圈之價格，已經中信局核定，計每　爲五十萬元，較市上其他紙圈，低廉不少，該公司現正趕辦手續中，約可於本月廿六日開始辦理。繳款日期爲廿六日至卅日，各烟廠於接得通知後，可按規定日期往中信局繳款，憑解款根據換取准購申請書，再向貨物稅局掉准購三聯單，至中華公司掉棧單，自行出貨。</p>
<p>日貨紙圈，質地雖較差，然當此紙圈缺乏之時，對各廠之供應，亦不無少補。聞中信局存於關棧中之紙圈，爲數尙有不少，盼各廠本期之配貨，勿予以放棄，以免喪失下期之權利云。</p>

<p>（註）　杜詩每自比契稷　，或以爲過，然千萬戰詩宗巍　然作聖，自比契稷，　謙辭也。　公大歷一二年出峽，流寓荊楚；大歷五年卒，有詩云：「湖南爲客動　春燕子還來覓主人，」故以　語哀之。　公詩始於開元天實間，卒於大歷五年，几二十九年，詩千一百四十一首，放定僞詩「至日遺與第二首」，「巴西亭觀江漲第二首」，「逃難」凡三首，見於他集者「哭長孫侍郎」「號國夫人」「軍中醉語」「杜鵑行」四首，實凡千一百三十四首。　有陪李北海宴歷下亭與李白同尋范隱居諸詩，二李皆年長於杜。　天寶十載，公始至京師，奏三大禮賦，史集皆以爲十三載。按帝紀十戰行三大禮，杜表亦云：「臣生長陛下淳樸之俗，行四十敝矣。故知當在是歲」。</p>
<p>鳳葆翎毛翠織成，公卿動色相傾顧，仙官不樂帝在旁　，出尉河西參率府　；往來白水鄜州客，帳望嶽運臨大路；漁陽鼓　聲不聞，羸服還奔行在所　。</p>
<p>（註）　公在長安召試文章，參列選序，以忤李林甫不得官。唐摭林稱李林甫爲仙官。　天寶十四載授河西尉不拜，改右衛率府　曹參軍，以家在奉光，十一月往奉先，　北及，書未至，公已脫身畿甸。　大寶十五戰七月肅宗即位靈武，改元至德。公自白水往鄜州，秋自鄜奔行在所。</p>
<p>凝碧池頭幾管絃，廣文柿　遭炊煮；脫身陷賊一猶龍，麻鞋赤血奔靈武　；小臣好言拾遺職，三司不推天子怒　；午門駐馬出京國，從此樓遲莾迴亙　　。</p>
<p>（註）　公北征及陷　藪時，王維鄭虔皆遭汚職，公獨脫身，謁上鳳翔，拜左拾遺，　公論疏救房琯，上怒詔三司推問；宰相張鎬救得免，放還鄜州。　　乾元元年六月以房琯故，出爲華州司功；二年春關輔　，棄官西去，度隴，客秦州，自此崎　秦蜀，迫下荊楚，不復至京師矣。</p>
<p>秦州生事滿目悲，直爲饑驅走關輔　　；西行入蜀無已時，蜀天常陰夜長雨；草堂卜地西枝村，總爲無　錢惜斤斧　　。</p>
<p>（註）　　公於乾元二年客秦州，有雜詩二十首，三吏三別皆途中作。蓋杜詩超凡入聖之初期也。　　公營草堂不始於成都，初覓地於秦州，赤谷西　之西枝村，愛其贊上人雲房相近，終以貲困不果。</p>
<p>浣花溪水水西頭，一　乾坤棲　處，眼前突兀見此屋，二百年前老柟柱　　；老妻遝　兒將作，建此茅草堪一畝；南隣買竹北　栽，何卿橙木徐卿果；五株桃樹四株松，三月堂成花木具　　。飛烏將子　棲息，買艇引妻遨近渚；　棋敲針生事微，客至長愁無酒脯　　。</p>
<p>（註）　　公柟樹爲風所拔云「故老相傳二百年，誅茅卜居總爲此。』　　杜詩草堂成有從韋明府覓綿竹，蕭明府乞桃栽，恣何少府覓枯木，詣徐卿覓果栽諸詩。又還草堂詩有「小逕草堂舊石斜，五株桃樹亦從遮，」四松詩『四松初移時，大抵三尺强，別來忽三歲，離立如人長。』皆公手澤所經營。又詩『聯止飛烏將數子，頻來語燕定新巢，』則草堂成正乾元元年之三月也。　　公迎妻子不見詩題，而『老妻畫紙爲棋局，稚子敲針作釣鈎』『　行老妻乘小艇，閒看稚子浴晴江』天倫之樂，頻見乎詩。</p>
<p>自來經營三載强，中間覓食仍遭侮，甫也諸侯老賓客，飛騰無那思廉頗　　；風雨侵尋年復年，藥欄崩湍茅　仆　　；冥冥細雨夏及秋，數欲移船泊荊楚　　。（註）　　公詩『經營上元始，斷手手手盤應年』其居草堂僅三載耳。中間數至新津靑城間，間往漢州　中以覓食，其贈高適詩「飛騰無郝故人何』蓋怨而悱矣。　　公水檻詩『茅軒駕巨浪，焉得不低埀，』又云「堂苦沙崩損藥欄」皆因避亂常離草堂，所以至此。　　代宗實應元年，公居成都，七月送嚴還朝，未幾，西川兵馬使徐知道反，因入梓州，冬歸成都，迎家至梓，客於章彝，十二月往射洪，將出蜀，有將適吳楚留別章使君詩。</p>

<p>安麯米但取醉，忠州使君無平素；空山禹廟落日斜，北望那堪辭後主！回首茫茫許杜鵑，臣甫低頭泣如訴，天地何知宋王悲，誤將秋興當辭賦；人言老去詩律細，我覺　州詩更苦　　　；萬里風烟盜賊尊，夜夜孤舟泣嫠婦，入峽出峽何所爲？總爲饑來不能住。</p>

<h3>「揚州蘇州」前記</h3>
<p>— 姚江濱</p>
<p>談紀遊詩</p>
<p>抗戰八年，我遠在山城。一切使人不能忘懷那淪陷已久的半壁河山；我是更親切的懷念着遙遠的江南！</p>
<p>東歸以來，我爲了生活，常奔走於大江南北，有機會看到許多戰亂的現象，也有機會看到許多粉飾太平的事實，但我所惑興趣的，不是那些世事是非的爭執，不是那些表而的繁華；却是被人忽視的那些荒凉的郊野，殘破的名勝，以及多少刦後的江山。</p>
<p>只要有一點空閒，我就來去湖山之間，許多亭台樓閣，眞的都給戰火葬送了！這雖然給人不無滄桑之感，但是能够舊地重遊，看看戰後的殘山剩水，却也欣慰。每當倦遊歸來，我就隨筆小記，其中有詩八篇。以地區言：包括鎭·揚·句容·蘇·錫一帶；拿名勝說：是由瘦西湖到金山，到焦山；到茅山；一直到太湖，到天平山……現在編爲「揚州到蘇州」一册，算是一種記遊的詩集，讓它留一點山水的遊痕。</p>
<p>以新詩來寫湖山勝景，顯然是一種嘗試。我的想法是這樣；詩，最好有一種意境，有一種情感和一種節奏。大好的江山，本來就有她偉大深還的境界；那些松風水月，那些斜陽塔影，那些亭橋林苑，本米是　的對象，最富有詩意；那些風雷松濤，那些鶯啼燕語，那些古寺鐘聲和漁歌樵唱，簡直是天地間山水人物的交響樂曲，是最樸素的旋律，最自然的大合唱。</p>
<p>人們所以鍾情於山水留戀名勝，是由於山水之問有許多可愛的意境，有許多可歌可泣埀久不朽的史蹟，有一種和諧的情調，和那些奇　奔放。諸山水的靈感。</p>
<p>我不是畫家，不能把那些山水樓台加以描畫；我不是音樂家，不能放情狂歌於名山大川之間！以往，我雖然到過許多富有詩意的江山峽谷，聽過許多山野的猿啼虎嘯，也曾憑弔過那些功在鄉邦情寄山水的英雄美人；還有，那些可歌可泣的史劇，那些風趣橫溢的佳話，那些十足表現當地鄉土美的特色……常時，並沒能把握現實寫一點東西，時間空問使得我往昔的記憶愈過愈糢糊了，想起來眞是可悔的事！</p>
<p>揚州到蘇州很近，我的遊踪所及，尤其有限。但這是大江南北山淸水秀之區，她代表着東方山水的秀美，有着典型的江南風光；而且歷史給她遺留許多古蹟，戰爭給她許多無情的摧毁；古來那些民族英雄的故事，一代美人的情趣，更傳遍了天下。近今，我能從忙中偸閒遊覽這幾個地方，已很高興了，但這點詩篇，那能寫盡這些江山的美？那能唱出她的情　？</p>
<p>因此，我希望讀到更多歌唱山水刻畫風情的遊記，詩章；更希望有這麽一天：我的足跡走得更遠更遠，爬上冲出雲霄的山嶺，或者到那無邊的海洋！</p>
<h3>阿爾卑斯的天空從日出到日落</h3>
<p>— 約翰·洛士金作　賽萊譯</p>
<p>破曉，當夜霧第一次從平原上升起，站在若干孤立的山巔，注視那些白色的，湖似的雲層飛過低處島嶼般的山脊，好似湖水繞蓋平直的，彎曲的湖沿。那裏只有淸晨的影響，但它們把却比夜半月光下無風的海還平靜，還冷。當第一股陽光射落在銀色的雲峽上時，看那些波動面上的泡沫如何地分開而遠去吧；而底下，在那白色蜿蜒的河道中間，輝耀的城和綠色的牧塲，躺着一如大西洋。在那些閃耀的塔尖中間，當團繞着的浪頭在它們上面破裂和消滅的時候，陽光是漸漸地射得愈底愈急了。於是，那些暗色山羣的山頂和山脊，狼狽地在平原上縮短了它們灰色的陰影。…停一歇，你將見那些分散的霧快將在山脚復合，然後沿着曲折的山谷慢慢地向你站處升起，直到它們已成了一塊塊很大的，被早晨的陽光煊染成了五彩而靜靜地躺在高山寬大的胸口爲止。於是那臃腫地波動着的輪廓將漸漸融化，融化，一直在强烈的光帶裘消失了，然後再在頭上寗謐的天空中出現，失去了它的光彩，像一個古老的，絢麗的，想入非非的夢，沒來由地，像是不可能地，它們本來的基礎在下面深湖的空幻而嘲弄的藍色中消失了。……再等一歇，你將見那些霧塊把它們自己疊成一個個白色的高塔，巨大而穩固，像堡壘似地沿着海峽盤立着，不停地更向天空加高，而斜躺在石上的陰影，也便愈來愈長了。那邊，在地平綫的灰藍色裏，有狹窄，暗黑而有力的一靈在形成，前進，它們將一寸寸地用它們灰色的網掩蓋起天空，用一種會合時使得烏類停止歌唱，樹葉停止搖曳的晦階把地上的光亮帶走。於是你將見有水平的，一塊塊黑色的陰影在它們下面生成；同時，你莫名其妙地，在沿着山肩處已環繞了蒼白色的漩渦了。——你不曾看到它的形成，但當你一回頭看那在一霎那前還是淸明的地方時，那裏却已有了一朶雲，正像老鷹踟躇於它的犧牲品似地掛在那懸崖上了。……接着，你將聽到甦醒的風突然掠過，而那些雲做成的守望塔便一個個被從根處拔起，吹走了；於是波動着的，朦朧的雨慕落在山谷中，從卸脫了重負的雲上有黑色彎曲的流蘇搖曳着，或者是成爲一注注灰色的雨柱，在湖面往來，惹起了湖面上一個個的小泡。</p>
<p>於是，當太陽沉下去的時候，你可以見到突然間暴風雨從山上傾奔下去了。在寬闊的邊上冒着氣，仍然是帶着詭譎的水氣的雪白，破爛，一會兒消失了，又集起了。道時那個好像只是在你身邊燒着的紅球般太陽，簡直可以碰得到似的，一會兒突然間燥急地穿過往來衝繫的風和滾動的雲而落下去，好像將用它的血把整個的天空染紅，而再不升起，：於是你將聽見那逐漸消失的騷動終於在夜的空幻裏完全死去，而一個綠　開始在東山上閃耀，慢慢地亮起來，亮起來，一直等到那大而白色的月亮已一步步慢慢地步入成羣的雲際的時候。接着它一一地點亮了天空的星星，就地使成了一個灰色，透明像羊毛絨似的花冠，照亮着大地；它們手牽着手，脚合着脚，一步步地相陪着移動，髣髴整個的天空也像在滾轉着，而大地正在下邊蹣跚。……再等一小時，等到東方的天空再度呈現紫色，而腫脹的山羣再度像大海中波浪一般地在里暗中　動，慢慢地一個個出現在它的光輝裏；看它們走過繫山時所留下的那些白色冰河般彎曲的渦路吧，不正像萬能魔王同他的火器麼？看那些孤寂的一個個雪的山頂吧，它們朝下面，閃　着一個又一個，每一個不正是一個新的淸晨麼？看吧，它們那長的冰山以比閃電還耀眼的光亮崩毁了，把每一個破碎的雪片像祭壇上的烟似地送上天空；那平靜的圓頂的玫瑰色的光在它們的身傍向上面照着天空，以更純的光透過那升起的雲經過時放上了新的光明，一直到整個的天空，一個紅色的華蓋已經以波動着的火焰的屋頂所織進，於是顫動，一個又一個地跳躍着，好像無數羣天使所展開的翅勝。於是當你看得已經意興盡時，當你已爲這　對造物者所生的愛及恐怖而屈服時，請吿訴我是誰杷這「神的」省訊帶到了世界上！</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>那麽您拼了性命，也得把底本找尋出來是不是？那，您得失望而又失望了。什麼原故呢？說一句實話，我們的「暗語」等等，是沒有索隱「底本」的。</p>
<p>固然，我們記事册中的那些起居註，天晴天雨等，都是極關重要的秘密消息，設若沒有底本，縱然常時記得，日子一久，豈非連自己都要忘記了麽？</p>
<p>那又不然，您大概還記得鶴見發明了一種簡易秘密電碼的話？他對於這一類工作，確有專長。我們的記事册，記事方式，也是應用他這秘密電碼作爲基本方式，然後稍稍加以變動罷了。他的秘訣，就在機械變化，參以有機變化。機械變化是刻板方式，無需多大記憶力，好比算術的「九九表」一般，一次熟記，永遠可以應用。有機變化，却須稍稍仰仗記憶力，然因其中滲有機械刻板方式，而有機的變化，又有機械式的規則控制着，只須推解力强，就可解釋，並無需乎多大的記憶力。</p>
<p>所以，我們谷人的紀事册，所記各事，我們自己很明白，一見就知某項係指茶事某物，迎萬分之一的錯誤都不易發生。不但如此，我們各人的密語，雙方都能　；這是因爲我們應用的方式都是一個系統</p>
<p>至於如如如何製成這個機械滲合有機方式，一時却也不易說明，我且舉一個例，您或能一目了然了。譬如鶴見所記關於「七月三十一日乘水上飛機『前驅」號，被召返東京，受軍佐二人嚴密監視，行動失去自由，有如罪犯：」在他的手册上却是：</p>
<p>「陰，二友力邀赴海浴，辭不獲。」以上這寥寥數字，根據前面已寫明的事實，您大概已經悟出了這們方式的形成。其餘需要詮釋的，就是「東京行」，「水上飛機」，「前驅」等幾點。但也極其簡單：「東京行」就藏在一個「海」字之中；因根據鶴見當日動身地點是在中國，只有東方是海；換句話，海字指出行的方向，而方向中的「東」却明明說出了行目的地「東京」。</p>
<p>至於「水上飛機」的代表術語，就是那個「浴」字，這是我們機械式原有的術語，然也含有有機的變化，可以推詳出來。假如是陸地飛機，我們所用術語，有「馳馬」，「駛車」，「飯團」，「匕首」，「自働筆」，等等。「前驅」這個名詞却是隱含在「赴」的字形中；同時日本舊軍歌中，有一熟句，是「壯士前驅赴敵疆，前騙赴敵疆……」因此看了「赴」字就很容易聯想到「前驅」二字。</p>
<p>關於飛機名稱，以及各種艦隊，部隊番號，槍砲炸彈，軍用品等等，還有一點須得聲明的，那就是我們選一類的工作人員，必須有一個廣泛的收集，而且在事前，必須繪這每種東西，都定下一個術名或綽號，有的是「類名」，有的是「特稱」，就像江湖朋友從歇後，影射，象形，等等格式，　出許多「行話」「術語」一般</p>
<p>此外，鶴見道一條記事中，並不特殊着重這個飛機名稱，只是隨隨便便記下；是否定是「前驅」並無重要關係。萬一這飛機名稱，特關重要，他的紀載，必有特別方式，把這名稱表現出來。</p>
<p>「他媽的巴子；……」鶴見看見我對他運用這個關外海罵，有些驚怪，他哈哈一笑之後，頓了一頓，却無端再來一個，好像有意逗笑似的。</p>
<p>「什麽道理，老鶴？」我有意無意地問；當然是問他這股口異起來。</p>

<h3>可塑物與現代文明</h3>
<p>— 孟琨</p>
<p>人類文化的進度，往往以他們物質生活中所採用的材料來分　；這樣，歷史家就　出了舊石器時代，新石器時代，青銅時代，和鐵器時代等。這一些時代的年月動以萬計，同時也只採用　天然的物，自己不能創造新的物體。自襄珞珞，玻璃，電木，合金，以及人造絲，人造橡皮，人造象牙的證明，人類自己懂得去用科學的方法製造新性質的物體了，可以適用於各別的器具。最後，於是發明了可塑物（Plastics）。可塑物在各種性能上的多樣性，　　於一切以往所製造出的合成品以上，差不多可隨人心意地配合到任何需要；那樣一來，人類的生活形態是大大地改進了，突過前代了。所以有人種我們所生存的此一時代爲「可塑物的世紀」，表示對鐵器時代等的進步意義。</p>
<p>可塑物的發明，勉強說來，到今日約一百年；然而真能實際誼，便還是近十年來的事。關於可塑物的發明過程，以及其他專出版物已介紹得相當完術和仔細，不必多贅。</p>
<p>通常我們俗稱可塑物爲「玻璃」，那是錯誤的。並且，祗是講「玻璃」，也不過指出某一種可塑物，却未能盡可塑物的「多才多藝」。可塑物是一類種，是一總名，它一共包含著千百種不同性能的各別材料，爲了各別的需要。它的性狀，是隨處而異的，凡是別的物體所能有的性能，它大都可以描摹得像；惟其如此，在未來的世界裏，無疑地，可塑物將代替了一切的原料，而成爲人類生活唯一的物質源。</p>
<p>它可以有各種的性質。一般說來，它可有不同的硬度，延展度，堅靮或柔軟，它可以有潤，可以着色，可以劃花紋，它可以防火，或易燃，它可以不銹,抗鹽，抗酸，它可以抗濕，抗氣溫，它可以很輕，很潔淨，它可以耐熱，耐冲擊力，它可以透光，絕電緣，它可以有彈性，有反射性，它無臭，不縮不裂，易　，以及其他性能。其實，具備了這些性能，也就是具備了一切性能；所以，如金屬，木材，橡皮，磁陶，　雜，紙，合金，玻璃，只是遲早的事。未來人類的生活勢必都以可塑物爲依賴的了。</p>
<p>到目前爲止，可塑物與人類的關係已相當密切。沒有一個人能全然地拒絕它或不受它的影響的引誘。以往的好些東西，而今都用可塑物來製造了，並不太貴，且極方便。這裏，且舉出一般與人類生活已有了相當成績的可塑物器具。</p>
<p>一·居住方面。我們常聽到流動房屋等名詞，那往往就是純以可塑物造的。便是在舊型的房屋及其他建築物，可塑物的應用亦漸廣了，它可以代替鋼骨爲各種架構，可以代替水泥和木材去作爲牆壁和門窗，以及附屬物。它可以代玻璃，地板，屏風，往往多以可塑物製了。塗料，漆，也有用另一種可塑物的。樓梯，屋頂，窗帘，浴具等，亦然。此外是　具，電燈電話電爐，和其他種種。</p>
<p>二·衣着方面。可塑物可以代羊毛，代別的　　。從春裝，夏裝，到冬裝的各類　物，都可以可塑物爲原料。可以製雨衣，大衣。紐扣現在大半是可塑物的了。鞋跟，鞋面，皮包，提箱，都能用可塑物。此外，除了領帶，假花，某些裝飾品固可以可塑物做原料，即是鋼筆，煙咀，打火機，髮夾，眼鏡，錶帶等附屬品，隨在身畔的，亦大多用可塑物製作。當然，帽類，氈毯類，手套，襪子，披肩，背帶，及內衣襯衣浴衣等的可塑物亦屬屢見。</p>
<p>三·交通方面。到大戰告終的那年，已有了可塑物的飛機和汽車，不過並不是全部的，只限於壁部，罩掩物，和輪子及另件等。而今已有了可塑物的纖路。遊艇，和自由車。在零件方面，它的應用更廣，如燈光調節器，玻璃透明，嵌鑲物，路盤，開關，及信號燈等。</p>
<p>四·衛生方面。在醫學上，可塑物最先適用於儀器和械具，如器具架，　瓶，面罩，鏡，假製人體模型，及其他手術器，此外，縫線和齒科用的義齒，及　腿等也有用可塑物做的。</p>
<p>五·娛樂方面。運動器俱差不多都可拿可塑物來做了。照相器具和其零件亦然。有可塑物的遊艇，釣魚用具，收音機。　　片，電影幕等。兒童的玩具好多是用可塑物做的。賭博用品，如紙牌，麻將，骰子，也常用它。音樂的玩器，從琴鍵起，都可以用可塑物製造。</p>
<p>六·其他方面。在出版方面，可塑物先代了鉛字，又能用作印刷板的原料，重工業及輕工業都用得　它。食物中的　頭，近來都用可塑物了。化學機器，以可塑物爲最宜。此外，打字機，救火噴水管，都市水道，藝術模型，無線電等，亦多用得着它。此外，如戰爭等，亦不免與可塑物有關，這却不是人類生活的幸福象徵。</p>

<p>一切物質，都由分子構成，已爲物理學者所公認，宇宙間所有構成物質的分子，性質互相不同，而大小完全一樣，在同溫度同壓力同體積下含有的分子是一律相等的。像空氣於平常溫度壓力下一立方糎的體積有27×10-18個分子，試將這一立方糎的空氣分子密　排列，則此行列之長，可繞地球赤道二〇〇匝，其數字之大，實足驚人。</p>
<p>但是分子是由原子構成的，在四十年前科學家還公認原子是組織物質的最小單位，直到一八九五年英人湯姆生氏（J．J．Thomson）遂證明原子尚非最小，而電子方爲組成物質的最小單位，且宇宙間物質各類多至不可計數，原子也有九十二種，而電子盡屬相同，毫無二致，所以物質實在是原始於一種電子，以造成九十二種原子，再由九十二種原子，化合爲恒河沙數的分子，而互相結合成宇宙萬物，　　　　　質。</p>
<p>東西，好像滄海一栗，涉得　　言喻，其數字非常驚人，試以電子的「電量」「直徑」「質量」三項觀之。</p>
<p>每個電子所荷的電量爲1.50×10-19庫倫，爲使讀者更明白這數字的小得駭人起見，設有一　一〇〇瓦的電燈，燃點一小時所通過的電子數要22680×10-18個之多，這數字的大，即表示電子所荷電量之少，做過比方罷，假設普通人每分鐘能計數一百次，以一小時六十分鐘，一天二十四小時　（通夜不睡）一年三百六十五天（一天不休息）計算，他每年約可以數完五千三百萬個電子，如果動員全中國的人民四萬萬六千萬人（男女老少總動員）來做這數電子的工作，要數一百萬年才能數完這一〇〇瓦電燈，燃點一小時所須的電子數目，但是，歷史告訴我們，自唐堯到現在，祇有四千多年呀！</p>
<p>再看電子的直徑爲2×10-13糎，要有五萬萬萬個電子排列起來，才有一糎長。</p>
<p>電子的質量爲9×10-28克，要有一一〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇〇個電子才有一克，我們知道一千克是一公斤，這電子的輕實在無法形容，請聰明的讀者看這二十八位的數字，應該可以體會得出來。</p>
<h3>倫敦的濃霧</h3>
<p>— 葛明</p>
<p>濃霧其實就是地面上的雲。我們還沒有澈底明白它怎麼會形成，所以難以十分確定地預言它的發生。海上的濃霧，我出現於夏季——六月裏在英倫海峽中是最壞的一個月，這也是英美故意選擇那時在法國諾曼底登陸的一個要因——但在陸上，濃霧卻是仲冬的現象。現在正是倫敦有濃霧的日子，平均一年很少超過二十天。可是一八八六年共有八十六天；而一九〇〇年，只有十三天，算是例外。</p>
<p>仔細比較城市和鄉間的情形，似乎可以知道都市裏的濃霧並不是煤烟造成的——這些不過使它更濃而已。可是都市空氣中的硫酸，猶如海上的鹽分那樣，會促成水汽的凝結爲細點。</p>
<p>濃霧中的水點，直徑只有百萬分之一　光景——含在其中的煤烟粒子比這還要細小。如你在倫敦的濃霧中步行一小時，你會吸進十四萬　顆的煤烟粒子。如果在曼　斯德，這數目還要增加百分這五十左右。格拉斯哥的五天濃霧，重一千三百噸，可發電七千瓩。</p>
<h3>顯微鏡史話</h3>
<p>— 潘承烈</p>
<p>要追索顯微鏡的歷史，倒有點困難。第一個　凸秀鏡和單顯微鏡的，很可能是十三世紀的羅吉·培根（Roger　Bacon），第一架顯微鏡是用一人——單透鏡做的以後的歷史我們知道得很少，直到十七世紀，有一位名安敦·文·李文霍（Anton　van　Leeuwenhock）的荷蘭人，開始在他空閒時麿琢透鏡和製造可放大物件的玻璃，後來他竟成了名，使許多來荷蘭的旅行家把看他的顯微鏡當作一件大事，那時李文霍並沒有確定的研究計劃，僅僅把顯微鏡照在手邊的隨便什麼東西上，他察看自己的血而發現它紅色細胞組成，他也研究蜘蛛，螞蟻，蛋，蜜蜂和其他小昆蟲，一天他察看自己牙齒中的牙垢找到有不少小點和小桿，使他十分驚異，但這重要發現未被人重視，他第一次看到了細菌——那些影響健康與疾病的微小組織，可是李氏郤沒有知道他的發明的重要性，事實上，到二百年後這才被人知道。</p>
<p>另一個呌琴生（Jansen）的荷蘭人，在他父親眼鏡店中工作時，發現把二塊透鏡放在一根管中可以清楚地看見遠處的東西，這消息傳到意大利，天文學家伽利略（Galileo）知道了便着手設計一種可以觀察天體一的儀器結果他的望遠鏡使東西比肉眼看時大了一千倍，而且近了三十倍以上。</p>
<p>這些食品逐漸發展，起初儀器所不能見的東西現在也可明晰地看到，顯微鏡和望遠鏡替我們打開了個看不見的世界，據說，肉眼只能看見三千顆星，用了伽利略的望遠鏡就可見一百萬，威爾遜山上的大望遠鏡能攝影得出的有將近二十萬萬，有許多理由可以使人相信如東發明了放大倍　更強的望遠鏡便可看出銀河來也是成千成萬的星所組成的但現在還沒有一具望遠鏡能證明這事</p>
<p>顯微鏡是現在醫生最有用的工具，靠了它，他學習到不少關於身體的構造和功用。</p>
<p>例如，顯微鏡告訴我們身體上每一器官和組織（Tissuc）是以細胞爲單位的，我們能看見這些細胞而加以研究，身體中各器官的細胞都不同，因此組織的顯微鏡觀察指示我們它們來自什麼器官，同時它們的開關也大有實際價值，假定有一個人胸中生了瘤，醫生單靠感覺常說不出是否須要動手術，他就去請教病理學家，當病人仍上着麻藥時，他趕快取一塊這組織去察看，顯微鏡會告訴他這到底是不是有癌。</p>
<p>用了顯微鏡，我們可以數紅血球白血球和血小板，由此可知這是否有血虧或其他疾病，紅血球的正常數目每立方毫米大約是五百萬，白血球是七千五百，這　相當重要，很多疾病會使白血球增加，如肺炎和盲腸炎，此外也有不少疾病，像流行性感冒和肺結核，便血球數目或是正常或是減少。</p>
<p>同是顯微鏡對研究身體上各種內分泌也有可貴的幫助，對微菌學和海綿腫病也一樣，用它還可區別不同的寄生物，我們覺得奇怪，百年前醫生沒有它怎樣能進行他們的工作。</p>
<p>顯微鏡使人們能明察秋毫，見所未見，方知世界之大無所不有，它對於科學的貢獻，真是不可勝數了。</p>
<h3>北極氣溫增高</h3>
<p>— 劉達德</p>
<p>誰都知道北極的氣候異常寒冷，奇怪的却是那裏的氣候正中漸趨暖和。據瑞典著名的土壤學家亞孟博士（Dr．Hans　Ahlmann）宣稱：自一九〇〇年以來，北極的氣溫增高了華氏十度，面在同一個時期，軍事戰略地帶的斯匹次貝爾根（Spitbergen）區域，北極洋中水的溫度，增高了華氏三至五度，既然溫度逐漸　高，很明顯的冰河將加速的溶化，於是水面每年要升高一至一·五毫米。這些數字在普通人看來，也許不算什麼，可是在一個科學家的眼中，這實在是一筆龐大的數目。近年來這種氣候變化的現象雖經發現，其基本原因却仍無法解釋，當然我們也可以假定這是地球的特性之一。不過無論其原因如何，亞氏認爲這種現象正在引起一種嚴重的國際問題。我們試想如果南極的結冰區和格林蘭巨大的冰山亦以同樣的速率溶化，那麼洋面即將　高，而至成爲災禍，於是沿着岸邊　地居住的人民，將遭受到多麼嚴重的泛濫之害。</p>
<p>在世界上別的地方也不乏氣候變化之例，譬如在過去十五年至二十年中，我們知道在熱帶地方有着顯著的氣候變化，特別是非洲西部一帶，那裏許多小湖沼完全絕跡，而較大的湖泊亦在逐漸乾涸，縱使極大的維多利亞湖，在過去十年中，也降落了七英寸。從這些例證看來，我們更可以知道北極氣候的變化並非不可能的。</p>
<p>有趣的是北極氣候的變化，却给了人类一些便利，因为它改善了欧洲北部边缘的航行情形，苏联更因此得到很大的发展。在一九一〇年，沿斯匹次貝爾根西岸的航行季節不過三個月，可是現在已經增到了八個月，所以就世界戰略的重要來說，氣候的變化到是很有利了。</p>
<p>一個科學家的眼光却和軍事家有所不同，科學家們除考慮目前的利害之外，還在顧慮到人類永久的幸福。所以當亞氏想到北極氣候的逐漸變化所可能引起的巨大遠禍，即認爲情形異常嚴重，而主張以整個世界爲基礎，組織一個國際機構，專門來研究和解決這問題。</p>
<p>亞氏爲斯德哥爾摩大學的地理學教授和瑞典地理學院的導師，他曾在加里福尼亞大學地理學院的研究室中，作研究工作二十餘年，以他如此豐富的學識和經驗，著重的提出這問題，是值得我們加以重視的。</p>

<h3>The National Assembly General Election Successfully Completed, Full List to Be Announced Within Ten Days; Chairman to Select Capital, Speaker Chen Yu-kuang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The nationwide frenzy of general elections for National Assembly delegates reached its peak on the 23rd. Voting across various regions, lasting three days, was completed by the evening of the 23rd. The foundation for a democratic constitutional government, destined to last for ten thousand years, has been laid. Except for some pacification zones where elections will be conducted step by step according to supplementary election regulations, the list of approximately 2,500 National Assembly delegates will be fully announced within ten days.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Chairman Chiang arrived at the No. 8 polling station in the first district of Nanjing City at 8:09 a.m. on the 23rd. As a citizen, he voted for Chen Yu-kuang as a National Assembly delegate. (Note: Chen is the Speaker of the Nanjing Municipal Council and the current President of Jinling University.) The Chairman, dressed in casual yellow attire and a black felt hat, entered the gate of Daxinggong Elementary School polling station. He immediately went to the verification desk and then sat down at the ballot issuing desk, completing the ballot quickly. The Mayor of Nanjing, Shen Yi, told the Chairman, "You need to cast it yourself." The Chairman then went to the ballot box and personally dropped it in gently. At that time, Chinese and foreign photographers captured the precious moment. When the Chairman entered the Daxinggong Elementary School polling station, twenty Boy Scouts from the school stood at attention and saluted, shouting slogans such as "Welcome Chairman Chiang to implement constitutionalism" and "Long live Chairman Chiang." The Chairman smiled, nodded, and said, "Good, good." He completed his voting procedure in two minutes and then left.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Heads of various ministries and commissions of the National Government went to various polling stations on the 23rd to vote for National Assembly delegates. Around 10:00 a.m., Vice Chairman Sun Ke, Premier Zhang Qun, President of the Executive Yuan Yu Youren, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Gan Naiguang, and others went to the No. 3 polling station at Langya Road Central Elementary School to vote.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] When Premier Zhang Qun went to Langya Elementary School to vote for National Assembly delegates on the 23rd, onlookers crowded around. Zhang objected to this and explained kindly that voting should be conducted in secret and that others should not peep at how one fills out their ballot. The onlookers retreated accordingly. Zhang then wrote swiftly and personally put his ballot into the ballot box.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Premier Zhang Qun spoke to reporters after voting, saying that he was very pleased with the smooth process of the election. Wu Tiecheng told reporters after voting that this election was an unprecedented event in the history of the Republic of China, and that voting was the first lesson in democratic politics, which has now been completed.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] Chen Lifu, Minister of the Central Organization Department, stated: "China's unprecedented election is not as satisfactory as expected." The general lack of enthusiasm among voters is the most disappointing factor in the election. The limited interest is due to the instability of the Chinese situation.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The National Assembly delegate election has ended. Zeng Qi, Chairman of the China Youth Party, issued his views on the election to foreign reporters on the 23rd, saying: Although the results of the national general election will not be clear until a few days later, the general situation is much better than it was 35 years ago, because the general public is gradually becoming interested in elections, and women's voting is something that did not exist in the first year of the Republic of China. Zeng said: This morning, he personally went to the polling station and voted for She Chongfa, a China Youth Party member candidate in Nanjing, while his wife, Madam Juo Ruonan, voted for Chen Yu-kuang, a socially respected figure. Zeng said: As a couple, each exercising their sacred right to vote freely, he believes that they are no less worthy than the advanced countries in Europe and America. A foreign reporter asked: Now that the National Assembly election has come to an end, how will the number of seats for the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic League be negotiated? Zeng said: "The three parties are in the process of negotiating, and our party's list will be submitted in the near future."</p>
<h3>Elections Completed in Various Places, Disputes Arise in Linsen County, Fujian, Polling Station Destroyed</h3>
<h3>Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] Li Zongren, using his qualification as a citizen of the tenth Bao of the sixth district of Beiping, went to the Xishiku Church polling station at 10:20 a.m. this morning and voted for Xu Huidong, Speaker of the Municipal Council. When Li went to the polling station, he traveled simply, wearing a dark blue leather robe, green casual shoes, and an American-style felt hat. It was only when he showed his ID card that the staff recognized him as the Director of the Xingyuan. In the free professional election, the Journalists Association cast a total of 272 votes over three days, exceeding two-thirds of the members, with votes for Xia Qingmao dominating. Lawyers cast 192 votes, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners 242, Western medicine practitioners 488, and accountants 29 votes. The ballot boxes from all 92 polling stations in the city will be concentrated at the Huai Ren Tang at 9:00 a.m. on the 24th to count the votes.</p>
<h3>Shenyang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd] On the 23rd, a regular weekly holiday, the polling stations were extremely crowded with voters, especially the Education Association and various labor unions, where the number of votes cast was several times higher than the total of the previous two days. The voters waited patiently in the freezing cold of minus five degrees Celsius, forming long queues, with excited moods.</p>
<h3>Jilin</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 23rd] The third day of the National Assembly delegate election in Jilin was enthusiastic and orderly. This is the second major event in Jilin after the dissolution of the regiment.</p>
<h3>Qingdao</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 23rd] The National Assembly delegate election in Qingdao City was successfully completed on the 23rd, with the most serious participation from labor unions and women's associations. The Journalists Association cast 372 ballots, with about 30 abstentions. Mayor Li Xianliang visited various polling stations from time to time to inspect.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 23rd] There are many disputes in the general election in Linsen County. It is reported that the Bao chiefs and corrupt officials in Chen and Jiangbin townships of the county hoarded election certificates, so that voters could not vote. The ballot box in Jiangbin Township was filled with ballots. Conflicts arose yesterday as a result, and the polling station was destroyed by the crowd. In addition, due to the busy farming season, few people voted in Linsen County. Of the more than 220,000 voters in Fuzhou City, only 70,000 to 80,000 participated in the voting.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] When villagers surnamed Lin from Kunshi Township, Changle County in eastern Fujian Province, gathered to vote today, they clashed with villagers surnamed Chen from Gaolou Township. The Lin side fired warning shots and threw hand grenades, causing casualties on both sides. Disputes also occurred in Tantou Town in the county, damaging ballot boxes and injuring ballot supervisors.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 23rd] The 23rd was the last day for the National Assembly delegate election, and it was also Sunday. 300,000 voters voted, and the voting time was extended to 6:00 p.m. The candidates, with the spirit of "piling earth to build a mountain," spared no effort to seize the final key, and some even shouted hoarsely in front of the polling stations, "Please vote for so-and-so." The most interesting thing is that Hu Wenzhen, a member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, was mistakenly written as Hu Wenhu by the voters on as many as a thousand ballots. In addition, when Guangzhou University voted on the 22nd, it was discovered that more than 100 professor positions had been falsely reported and were removed on the spot. (More election news from various places is published in column one on page two.)</p>
<h3>The General Election in Xinjiang Province Can Begin in the Latter Half of This Month</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Dihua, 23rd] While hundreds of millions of voters across the country are launching the historic National Assembly delegate election, Xinjiang, due to its special practical situation, still needs to study some technical issues related to the election. As a result, four million voters have not been able to exercise this solemn and sacred right simultaneously with their compatriots in the interior. The Xinjiang Provincial Election Office is now preparing everything and is expected to begin the general election in the latter half of this month, and the candidates have already begun campaigning publicly.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The National Army, which swept away the remnants of Chen Yi's bandits in the Yongcheng, Guoyang, and Mengcheng triangle area, crossed Zishanji in the southeast of Yongcheng on the 20th and pursued the fleeing bandits southward. The remnants of Chen's Tenth Column, which had invaded the Jinxiang area in southern Shandong, were defeated by the National Army. Due to continuous rain and snow, the war has slowed down slightly. In addition, the National Army, which advanced along the Fengxian-Yutai highway, has approached Shunheji in southern Yutai and engaged in fierce battles with the bandit cover forces in the area north of Shiji.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 23rd] A part of the New Fifth Army, which rushed to Jinxiang from Xuzhou, arrived on the southeastern outskirts of Jinxiang on the afternoon of the 22nd and echoed the defending army, launching an attack on Liu Fei's Eleventh Column from both inside and outside, and the battle was fierce.

They have lost their fighting spirit, and many have abandoned their weapons and fled, and many have surrendered to the local troops with their weapons and sought to survive.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 23rd] On the 22nd, part of Chen Geng's bandits returned to Nanzhao, Fangcheng, and Tanghe, and more than a thousand returned to Lushan.</p>
<h3>The Battle on the Outskirts of Yuanshi is Fierce, the North Gate Has Fallen into the Hands of the Bandits</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] Yuanshi is still in the hands of the National Army, the battle on the outskirts is fierce, the North Gate has fallen into the hands of the bandits, and the National Army is confronting the bandits in the East, West, and South Gates.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] The traffic on the Pingbao road was interrupted again yesterday due to the harassment by the communist bandits in the Xuwei and Caohe areas of Xushui. Communist bandits approached the outskirts of Xushui last night and were repelled. Two to three thousand communist bandits gathered at Jingtangpu, more than 20 miles west of Xushui, and came out to harass the area. Several joint transport trucks were burned by the communist bandits between Xu and Wei yesterday.</p>
<h3>The National Army in Yulin Pursues and Suppresses the Forces; the Defense of Yimeng is Strengthened; Deng Baoshan Has Entered Yulin City</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guihua, 23rd] Chen Yujia, the garrison commander of Yimeng, returned to Guihua from Baotou on the evening of the 22nd to report to the chairman of the party. It is reported that Commander-in-Chief Deng Baoshan has entered Yulin City, the communist bandits who attacked Yulin have been defeated, and the National Army is pursuing them on all fronts. The initial attempt of the communist bandits to invade Yulin was to besiege Yulin with a part of their forces and to flee north to Yimeng with a part of their forces to disrupt the two banners of the Zasak County King. However, because Commander-in-Chief Deng led his troops from Baotou to support and stationed in the Zha Banner, and the security teams of the banners of Yimeng also gathered to defend strictly, the communist bandits' conspiracy was not successful, and Yimeng has always been peaceful. Now that the siege of Yulin has been lifted and the communist bandits have retreated, the winter defense of Yimeng is even more solid. However, the disaster situation in Yimeng this year is severe, and a large amount of relief is still needed. Dongsheng moved its government in the autumn of this year. After a month of rain, more than 300 of the 500 houses in the city collapsed. So far, the broken walls have not been completely repaired. During the heavy rain, the city walls of Dongsheng also collapsed, and they have now been repaired.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Although the remnant bandits around Yulin City have been cleared, the crisis has not been reduced. The vitality of Chahar and Sui, which was blocked by the ice of the Yellow River in Baotou, continued to reinforce northern Shaanxi after the Yellow River froze firmly the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Hankou Police Bureau Cracked a Smuggling Case of Gold Transported by Air</h3>

<h3>The Eight Route Army were Defeated within the Border of Pinglu, Southern Shanxi</h3>
<p>A large amount of timber was left behind by the Yuncheng bandits.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 23rd] After the liberation of Yuncheng, the main force of the Eight Route Army bandits were defeated within the border of Pinglu at the foot of Mount Zhongtiao. The Yuncheng bandits suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources during the Yuncheng campaign. The military and civilians, men and women, young and old, were mobilized to destroy the bandit fortifications on the outskirts of the city and transport timber. Less than one-fifth of the timber has been transported, but more than two million catties have already been obtained. Among them, the door panels were transported from Yangcheng, Jishan, and Quwo. The number of sacks is countless, which shows the depth of the bandits' plan to occupy Yuncheng. The large amount of timber obtained has solved the problem of winter fuel for the military and civilians in the city. No wonder the bandits left Yuncheng crying. The Provincial Council suggested to the central government to implement the integration of soldiers and farmers and the civilian economy.</p>
<h3>The Order of the Jilin-Changchun Area is Gradually Restoring, Korean Communists Flee to Huapichang</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] After the National Army exerted pressure on the bandits in the Jilin-Changchun area and suppressed the sporadic bandits, the area has actually gradually returned to the state before the sixth bandit offensive. Military news: The National Army city defense forces in Jilin have been sweeping the area for days with powerful corps, and the bandits have been defeated and retreated. Now, there is no trace of bandit combat troops in Wulajie, Jiangmifeng, Zhaxing, Xiushuidianzi, and other strongholds on the outskirts of Jilin. Traffic to the outside of Jilin is gradually expanding. The Jilin-Changchun Road has been open to Jiuzhan since the 19th. The Jilin-Fengman Highway has been running a passenger bus once a day since yesterday. The Long (Tanshan) Feng (Man) railway branch line from Jilin to Fengman will resume traffic today. In addition, the northern section of the Shen (Yang) Ji (Lin) Road has been repaired southward from Jilin to a point 20 kilometers away.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Jilin, 22nd] Yesterday, thousands of Korean communists fled from Wulajie to Huapichang on the Jilin-Changchun line.</p>
<h3>The National Army Continues to Pursue and Suppress Liu Fei in Eastern Hubei</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The National Army, which crossed the Jushui River in eastern Hubei and entered Lijiaji, continued to pursue eastward with rapid progress. The first and second brigades of Liu Fei's First Column and the Second Column have lost all their combat effectiveness and are disorganized. From the 21st to the 23rd, the National Army killed and wounded 1,653 bandits, captured 520 bandits, and seized 210 rifles, 18 light and heavy machine guns, and 2 small artillery pieces on both banks of the Jushui River.</p>
<h3>U.S. Envoy Clark Visits the Chairman and His Wife</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The newly arrived U.S. Ambassador to China, Clark, accompanied by Ambassador Stuart, paid his first visit to Chairman Chiang and his wife at their residence on Huangpu Road at 4:30 p.m. on the 23rd. He left after talking for about half an hour.</p>
<h3>The CCP Radio Station and Espionage Organization in Beiping Were Cracked; Spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense Selectively Announces</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] According to the spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense, the Beiping Xingyuan cracked a secret CCP radio station and espionage organization in September this year. This case involves Yu Xinqing, a design committee member of the Baoding Suiyuan General Headquarters, and Li Gongyi, a student of Peking University. At that time, some people did not understand the truth and demanded the release of the arrested criminals. However, they did not know that the evidence of the crimes of these people was conclusive, and they had all confessed. Now, the process of cracking the case is selectively announced first in order to correct the public's perception. The initial investigation of this case was conducted by an intelligence officer sent by the Ministry to Beiping, who recruited a certain soldier participating in the CCP organization as an internal line. After more than a month of effort, it was finally confirmed. Therefore, the Beiping Xingyuan sent personnel to take action in the early morning of September 24th and cracked the secret CCP radio station at No. 24 Jingzhao East Street in Beiping. The motor and documents were seized on the spot, and its responsible person, Li Zhengxuan, telegraph operator Meng Liangwang, and code translator Zhang Houpei (Li's wife), and Li Yuping (Meng's wife) were arrested. After strict interrogation and detailed study of the seized documents, it was learned that this secret radio station and espionage organization belonged to the Central Intelligence Department system led by the CCP's Kang Sheng. It was also learned that the CCP's deployment of the intelligence network in Beiping began after the establishment of the Military Mediation Department. At that time, the CCP personnel used the Military Mediation Department as a cover. The person in charge was Li Kenong, Minister of the CCP Central Social Affairs Department, and the persons responsible for the actual operation were Feng Xuan and Xu Bing, secretaries of the CCP Military Mediation Department at that time. After the Military Mediation Department was dissolved and the CCP personnel withdrew, the CCP Central Intelligence Department decided to hand over all the previously deployed spy cells to Li Zhengxuan for management, command, and liaison. The funds for their work were 200 taels of gold left by Ye Jianying, which were used exclusively for black market trading to achieve self-sufficiency. Li Zhengguan stayed in Beiping and set up a secret radio station, and began reporting to the general station of the CCP Central Intelligence Department since March of this year.

<h3>The Ministry of Economy Decided to Fully Implement the Unified Cotton Yarn Distribution Method; Chen Qitian Guan Bu Yuan Liang Succeeded as Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee</h3>
<p>[Our City News] Chen Qitian, Minister of Economy, came to Shanghai from Beijing on the 22nd in view of the recent surge in yarn and cloth prices to discuss countermeasures with relevant parties. At 6:00 p.m. on the 23rd, he hosted a banquet on the 12th floor of the Shui'an Building for President Zhang of the Bank of China, Mayor Wu, Yuan Liang, the new chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, and more than 20 people, including all members of the committee and the heads and deputy heads of various departments. At the meeting, he announced:</p>
<p>Zou Bingwen, chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, has not yet completed his mission in the United States and will be temporarily unable to return to China. He has requested to resign and has been approved. The vacancy has been filled by appointing Yuan Liang, the former mayor of Beiping.</p>
<p>The trial method of unified cotton yarn distribution has been reviewed and decided by President Zhang, Vice President Wang, President Zhang, Minister Zuo, and myself. This method is a necessary measure to stabilize the prices of cotton yarn and cloth at present, and the government has decided to handle it accordingly.</p>
<p>The task of the Textile Adjustment Committee is to regulate the supply and demand of cotton yarn and cloth, and to assess its reasonable price, and at the same time to promote the development of the textile industry.</p>
<p>In order to stabilize yarn prices, the government will cooperate with the Bank of China, the municipal government, and the Ministry of Economy to support the Textile Adjustment Committee in carrying out its tasks. At the same time, it is hoped that the national and private yarn factories will be able to support the committee with a spirit of sincere cooperation and promote the government's current policies.</p>
<p>Finally, President Zhang and Mayor Wu delivered speeches one after another, expressing that the Bank of China and the municipal government are willing to assist in the advancement of the unified distribution trial method with great strength, and hope that private factories will sacrifice their own interests and take care of the entire national policy, so as to avoid the government taking emergency measures.

<h3>Far Eastern Economic Commission Meeting Opens Today in Baguio to Discuss Post-War Reconstruction of Asia, Chiang Ting-fu Hopes for Soviet Cooperation</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baguio, 23rd] The center of Far Eastern diplomacy will move from the 24th to the newly built building on the historic ruins of Baguio. Over the next two weeks, more than 200 representatives and experts from the eleven member countries and three sponsoring countries of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) will meet here to discuss the post-war reconstruction and economic development of this region, which is home to a quarter of the world's population and devastated by war. The second plenary session of ECAFE is scheduled to open at 3:00 PM on the 24th, and Philippine President Roxas will deliver an important speech. Among the delegations from various countries, the Netherlands has the largest number of representatives (14), followed by France (13), and then the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom (12 each). China has a total of seven representatives, while the newly established Pakistan has only one. The three sponsoring countries are Burma, Ceylon, and Hong Kong. Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations in charge of economic affairs, Woven, will participate in this session as the highest-ranking UN official present. It is reported that the two major components of reconstruction, food supply and transportation, will be the main topics of discussion at this session. The issue of Japanese reparations will also be discussed, and it is the only issue likely to cause strong disputes, as the question of "how to allocate industrial equipment to some Far Eastern countries that suffered serious losses during the war" is likely to lead to disagreements. The relationship between the ECAFE and occupied Japan and Korea will also be decided at this session. Although Japan and Korea are not currently participating in the ECAFE, the important question of the extent to which the post-war economies of Japan and Korea can contribute to the overall Asian economy still needs to be resolved. Some representatives attending the meeting and members of the ECAFE told reporters that, so far, this session has no political significance, and they also wish to avoid all political issues.</p>
<p>[Telegram] The second plenary session of the ECAFE has already encountered two thorny issues: one is the [blank] coup, which has raised questions about the attendance of its representatives, and the other is Indonesia's declaration that it will send representatives to the meeting regardless of Dutch opposition. News from here this afternoon said that the American diplomatic authorities stationed in Bangkok, representing the Philippines, have also refused to grant visas to the [blank] representatives to the Philippines, on the grounds that the United States has not yet recognized the new [blank] government. However, the Philippine government has expressed its hope that [blank] will attend the meeting and is taking appropriate steps to facilitate the arrival of the [blank] representatives in the Philippines. As for the issue of Indonesia's right to attend, it is not likely to be resolved at present, but the Dutch delegation already includes Indonesian representatives selected by the Netherlands.</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] New York, 23rd Broadcast: Philippines dispatch, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East will be chaired by Chinese representative Chiang Ting-fu. Chiang said today that hopes for a Marshall Plan for the Far East are not high. Whether this is possible is only known to Secretary of State Marshall. He believes that no representative to the ECAFE should propose this suggestion. Chiang hopes that the Soviet Union will adopt a cooperative attitude, and said that the ECAFE will never propose anything that harms Soviet interests. The results obtained after the meeting will be submitted to the Economic Council for approval.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The End of the General Election and Political Education</h3>
<p>The nationwide general election of National Assembly representatives concluded yesterday. Judging from the capital, from Shanghai, and from the general situation in various provinces and cities, it can be generally described as a major step forward in China's political history of the last hundred years.</p>
<p>Of course, given the relatively low level of education of the Chinese people and the long-standing habit of "top-down" politics in China, this unprecedented general election is difficult to be completely satisfactory. The indifference of a large number of people to the election, the complications in receiving ballots, and the inability to ensure complete secrecy and freedom in the voting process may all be subject to criticism from observers in advanced democratic countries or people with democratic literacy. However, we should imagine: how can an infant just learning to walk compete with an athlete in a 100-meter race? How can a student just learning to swim compete with a strong swimmer who is accustomed to the water in crossing the Huangpu River? Then, in a China where most voters have not yet received sufficient political education, the initial general election can have a generally accurate effect. On balance, it should be a major event worthy of celebration by the whole country.</p>
<p>Therefore, in our opinion, the results of this general election, who are the elected National Assembly representatives in various places, and which party has the majority, are secondary. What is important is that the Chinese people, in the midst of the unrest caused by the Communist bandits, were still able to calmly receive a political education, showing that they are all willing to learn to "take the first step" on the road to democratic constitutionalism, which is worthy of attention from ourselves and well-intentioned international friends. The editorial in the "Ta Mei Evening News" a few days ago, while regretting the indifference of voters on the one hand, hoped that the government would give the people in various counties and cities more opportunities to elect local officials to manage local affairs in the future. The editorial in the "North China Daily News" also acknowledged that China's emergence as a democratic country, implementing a general election, represents a major political advancement for the country and is the most educationally meaningful measure in China since the Xinhai Revolution. Indeed, in this general election, our people truly did a "political tutelage" job themselves; and we hope that such self-political education or self-political training will undoubtedly be strengthened in the future.</p>
<p>We hope that in these elections with political educational significance, we will fully encourage ordinary voters to value their right to vote, fully ensure that they have the guarantee to exercise their right to vote completely freely, prescribe simple and feasible election methods as far as possible, and prevent all illegal coercion and activities. The general election of National Assembly representatives has ended, and there will soon be a general election of Legislative Yuan members. As long as the whole country has the sincerity to learn democracy, we believe that the order and effect at that time will be more advanced than this election of National Assembly representatives.</p>
<p>Finally, no matter who is elected, no matter which party is elected more, since they are produced by elections, they should all value their identity as "national representatives"; whether they are in power in the government or supervising in the opposition, they should all think about the country and the people at all times, so that China can truly be built into a new China of the Three Principles of the People, and no longer haggle over the private interests of a party, a faction, or a few individuals!</p>
<h3>Attention to the International Trade and Employment Conference</h3>
<p>The International Trade and Employment Conference opened in Havana on the 21st of this month. More than 600 representatives from 40 countries around the world are discussing the charter of the International Trade Organization and will unanimously support all the resolutions passed by the International Trade Conference held in London, New York, Geneva, and other places over the past year. However, many obstacles are expected in the future. We believe that the success or failure of this international conference will have a significant impact on the future of world trade and must be closely watched.</p>
<p>Originally, exchanging labor and goods, and bartering to supply needs, is a mutually beneficial act; this is the case between individuals, and also between countries. However, due to the strength of national power, the abundance of resources, the superiority of production technology, the level of living standards, and various prejudices such as race, religion, and diplomacy, international trade, in addition to bartering to supply needs, is inevitably mixed with many other effects. As a result, the ideal of free trade, except for the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century, has not been put into practice.</p>
<p>The opposite of freedom is closure, blockade, interference, restriction, and control, which are measures that come and go and retaliate against each other. Thus, the originally mutually beneficial act turns into a mutually hostile act; and this economic hostility is very likely to rapidly degenerate into political and military hostility. Looking back at modern history, almost eight or nine out of ten international wars have this as the trigger. After reflection and change, it is no wonder that the call for free trade will rise again with the Second World War.</p>
<p>The so-called International Trade and Employment Conference is the crystallization of this kind of call. Its origin lies in the Atlantic Charter announced by Roosevelt and Churchill in 1941, which stipulated the principles of international economic cooperation, trade freedom, and equal access to raw materials; and it was facilitated by the recommendations on international trade drafted by the US State Department in 1945. This book was sent to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, which decided to convene a preparatory meeting in London in October last year, which was the beginning of the formal action of the International Trade and Employment Conference.</p>
<p>The London Conference was the first preparatory meeting, attended by 18 countries including China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, while the Soviet Union and other countries refused to participate. After six weeks of meetings, although there were no concrete results, 80% of the draft proposed by the United States had been passed. It was also decided to hold the second preparatory meeting in Geneva on April 10 of this year.</p>
<p>During the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union and other countries still did not participate, and only 18 countries participated. After six months, 122 groups of multilateral tariff agreements were signed on October 30, including more than 45,000 items; its achievements were the greatest of all previous international economic conferences. President Truman praised it as a milestone in the history of international economic relations. The Economic and Social Council then decided to convene the formal meeting of the International Trade and Employment Conference on the 21st of this month, with its location in Havana, the capital of Cuba. Invitations were extended to more than 50 countries, and 32 countries accepted the invitation, which is more than the two preparatory meetings, but the Soviet Union and other countries still refused.</p>
<p>The task of this conference is naturally much more important than the preparatory meetings. Fortunately, the draft international trade charter has been passed in Geneva on September 10. Agreements have been reached on facilitating various international trades, increasing trade, increasing employment, and eliminating barriers to trade; and the main point of contention in international trade, namely tariff barriers, has been widely and separately signed into multilateral agreements. It can be seen that most of the obstacles to this conference have been cleared. In addition to the points reserved by the preparatory meeting that remain to be discussed, the rest is just to formally pass the resolved cases in the conference. In other words, the road to free trade can be said to have been laid in the two preparatory meetings. Broad and narrow interpretations should be adapted to the spirit of the times. In the current situation, there are very few countries that have unlimited free trade capabilities. Even countries that have not yet recovered their strength must use various methods to control imports and encourage exports in order to balance international payments. The development of American industry and the increase in employment can be said to have reached the highest level, but President Truman recently announced in Congress that he would also control exports. It is even more obvious that other industrially backward countries, with their weak foundations and unable to withstand strong external forces, must pay attention to appropriate protection policies. Therefore, at the two preparatory meetings, countries argued fiercely about this issue; when the draft was passed in Geneva, they had to adopt a compromise to coordinate the interests of all parties. Finally, the United States and France also agreed separately that the tax rates reduced during France's enrichment period could be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>The so-called multilateral tariff agreement, although its goal is to reduce tax rates to promote trade between related countries, its scope is limited to related countries. In this way, many small tariff groups are created between countries, replacing the individual tariff barriers in each country, which is still far from the goal of universal economic coordination and completely eliminating international economic conflicts.</p>
<p>From the first preparatory meeting to the formal conference, eight countries, including the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, [Blank], Saudi Arabia, and Abyssinia, have never participated. Although it is stipulated in the draft that they can apply to join later, all resolutions passed are of course not binding until they have obtained the qualifications of member states; thus, international trade at least maintains two major camps. Moreover, after the United Kingdom and the United States agreed to mutually reduce tariffs, the preferential tariff system of the British Empire Group was not completely abolished?</p>
<p>In addition, what actually hinders free trade is not only those barriers between countries, but also the excessive poverty of most countries. Because of the lack of foreign exchange, poverty hinders imports; because of the lack of materials, poverty blocks exports. Therefore, before industries are developed, purchasing power is increased, international payments are balanced, and employment rates in various countries are universally improved, even if trade barriers are completely eliminated, the scope of so-called free trade will still be limited.</p>
<p>In short, we naturally have deep expectations for this International Trade and Employment Conference. According to the achievements of the past two preparatory meetings and the enthusiasm of various countries to participate, the achievements of this conference can also be expected. However, with the lineup still incomplete and poverty in the majority, so-called free trade may not have satisfactory progress in the near future. However, from the perspective of reducing obstacles to international cooperation to promote world peace and happiness, this is a powerful tool after all. We would like to wish the true advent of free trade here, and promise to devote ourselves to the task until the very end.</p>

<h3>Hankou Cracks Down on Air Transport of Gold Case</h3>
<p>(Continued from Page 1) Recently, various military radio stations here have been receiving a strange type of code, disrupting radio waves. After much investigation by the Criminal Police Team, it was learned that this code was mostly sent from Hong Kong and Guangzhou and was related to gold smuggling. Yesterday morning, a code was received stating that goods would be transported by air from Guangzhou to Hankou. The team sent many cadres to wait at the Wuchang Airport. At 3:00 PM, a China Airlines passenger plane landed, and two people got off the plane. One person went to greet them, and their behavior was very suspicious. They were followed to the wharf and inspected. Eighty-nine bars of gold, weighing 534 taels, were found in their suitcases. They were immediately taken to the bureau for questioning along with the person who greeted them. According to the interrogation results, one of the two men was Gan Lin, an employee of Zao Miao [Blank] Company, and the other was Xiong Jieming. The other person who greeted them was Lan Ziyuan, the manager of Zao Miao [Blank] Company. They confessed that they had transported gold three times. The first time was 370 bars, the second time was 60 bars, and this was the third time. It was also learned that the protagonist of this case was Hu Haigan, and its inside story involved more than a dozen banks, gold shops, and commercial firms in the city. They had also established a communication network of trading houses in various places. The organization was quite large. The Criminal Police are still searching and will not stop until the case is solved.</p>

The cotton yarn reprocessing trade associations in Shanghai and other ports shall, based on the equipment and yarn needs of their respective member factories and households, negotiate and stipulate the minimum amount of cotton yarn to be allocated to each factory and household each month, create a distribution list, and report it to this committee for distribution to the Sixth District Association and the China Textile Construction Corporation as the basis for cotton yarn allocation.  The cotton yarn allocated by this committee and the China Textile Construction Corporation shall be targeted at qualified reprocessing organizations or their member factories and households registered with this committee. Without the approval of this committee, cotton yarn shall not be allocated to yarn merchants who transport and sell it to other ports.  The Sixth District Association shall report the production and allocation of yarn to this committee for record every week.  The cotton yarn purchased by each reprocessing factory shall be used exclusively as raw material for weaving and shall not be resold for hoarding and profiteering.

If any violation is found, in addition to being severely punished according to law, the respective trade associations shall also bear responsibility.  All yarn selling by yarn allocation agencies shall be priced uniformly according to the Textile Adjustment Committee's negotiated price.  In order to mobilize for the suppression of the rebellion and stabilize commodity prices, the government may purchase cotton yarn at a fixed price when necessary.  In addition to these measures, the Sixth District Association and China Textile Corporation may formulate detailed measures for yarn allocation and report them to this committee for record.</p>

Pitiable are the cries of our parents, unbearable the tears of our wives and children. Although we want to endure hunger to teach and force a smile, the sound of reading is loud, but the mood is desolate. If further delayed, we will surely die. What is pitiable is that our parents, wives, and children will turn to the ditches, and our students will have no one to teach." Every word is a tear, filled with sorrow. Although some schools here have launched a ten thousand yuan labor-to-teach campaign, it is already a case of "too little, too late" for the teachers.</p>

<h3>Full Text of the Judgment Reasoning of Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and Liu Bojin (Part 1)</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Hangzhou] Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and Liu Bojin, who were arrested in the same case as Yu Zisan from Zhejiang University, were sentenced by the Zhejiang High Court at 10:00 AM on the 20th to seven years of imprisonment each. The text of the judgment is as follows: It has been verified that the defendants Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and Deng Bojin, and the deceased Yu Zisan were classmates at Zhejiang University and were ideologically left-leaning. All were members of the New Tide Society, with Chen Jianxin serving as the president of the society and in charge of liaison affairs, Huang Shimin serving as the head of the society's accounting division, and Liu Bojin serving as the head of the society's academic preparation division. The society had a reading club organization that collected various left-wing books and newspapers, circulated them among members, and produced reading reports. Furthermore, they opened the Fangfeng Farm in the Su Dynasty area near Fenghua, Zhejiang, to raise funds. New Tide Societies were established in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Taiwan, Fenghua, Pinghu, and other places. When Wang Jingxiu, a member of the society, got married in Hangzhou, Chen Jianxin and Huang Shimin brought a large number of reactionary books, newspapers, and letters to Hangzhou from Shanghai on October 25th of this year and stayed at the Datong Hotel on Yanling Road in Hangzhou with Yu Zisan and Li Bojin. They were arrested late at night. These facts have been admitted separately by the defendants during the investigation by the prosecutor of this court and during the trial in this court. They are consistent with the transcript of Yu Zisan's talks during his lifetime and the secret reports of the original arresting agency. Furthermore, there is evidence of reactionary left-wing books and newspapers (Political Common Sense, How to Study Dialectical Materialism, The Poverty of Philosophy, Wage Labor and Capital, Times Magazine, Zhanwang Magazine, World Knowledge, Times and Literature Magazine, etc.) seized on the spot, as well as letters from Wang Xia, a member of the society in Taiwan, and Peng Changhu, a member of the society in Nanjing. It is justifiable to consider them as true. Although the defendants denied that they were Communist Party members during the trial in this court and claimed that the New Tide Society they participated in was a private gathering dedicated to academic research, different from the New Tide Society, a secret organization external to the Communist Party. There was especially no competition for representatives of student self-government associations at all levels, secretly participating in the All-China Student Federation led by the Chinese Communist Party, inciting student unrest, or planning for the Communist Party's subversive plans. However, after reviewing the second transcript of Yu Zisan's talks on October 29th after Yu Zisan's arrest, sent by the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command:</p>
<p>Yu Zisan's talk transcript "Q" Are you still the chairman of the Zhejiang University Student Self-Government Association? "A" I am still in office, but I really want to get rid of this position. "Q" On the one hand, you want to get rid of this duty (on the other hand, you are preparing to strive for success in the re-election, is this not a great contradiction with what you claim? "A" Yes, I also feel the contradiction myself. "Q" Your school is preparing to establish a general election mechanism. A general election is a kind of open campaign. Why do you want to lead a small organization and secretly predetermine the representatives of each department? And these people are mostly members of the New Tide Society and the Reading Club. Obviously, you have a conspiracy to manipulate representative seats. "A" It is indeed not very right, but I myself do not know why I want to do this. It seems that there is always some force pushing me behind. "Q" What is the most powerful force? "A" Someone ordered me to do this. "Q" Who? "A" I can't say now. "Q" Why does the New Tide Society take the form of secret activities, and the books you read are all thoroughly reactionary? You red-ify a person, starting with various reactionary basic philosophies, and using the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Four Big Families as educational tools. Does this conform to the purpose of promoting democracy and developing social prosperity that your New Tide Society promotes? (Silent, no answer) "Q" What are the main activities of the New Tide Society at present? "A" 1. Contacting members in various places, extensively opening up various activities of the society, and absorbing members. 2. Developing production undertakings to enrich the society's funds (such as the Taoyuan in Fenghua, which is one of the productions). 3. Striving for the representative list of the Zhejiang University Student Self-Government Association. 4. Organizing a propaganda club inside and outside the school, with Xiang Bojin in charge, mutually researching and circulating various Communist Party theoretical books and newspapers. Liu Bojin is responsible for collecting the books of the reading club. 5. Transmitting and contacting orders and opinions from above and below. "Q" Has the New Tide Society been registered? "A" It has not been registered, nor has it been registered with the school. "Q" Has the Zhejiang University Student Self-Government Association secretly participated in the National Student Federation? "A" Zhejiang University is one of the Federation of Student Organizations. "Q" What is the relationship between the Student Federation and the Communist Party and the Democratic League? "A" The main members of the Student Federation mostly accept the leadership of the Communist Party and the Democratic League. "Q" It is said that the New Tide Society is not only a core of the reactionary group but also a mechanism for contacting the Student Federation. "A" Yes, in the way of various activities of the New Tide Society, it does accept the practices of the Communist Party and the Democratic League. I can admit that the New Tide Society is in fact connected with the Communist Party and the Democratic League. "Q" However, to say it again, the government has always been magnanimous towards you. Moreover, you are still students after all. Past mistakes can be made up for. Among the 450 million people in China, how many university students are there? What is the purpose of the country cultivating you and your parents raising you? "A" We know this, but why not tell them that "" "Q" Politics is the process of life. It is common for people to have different political positions, but when one's own political views violate the interests of the country and the nation, one should resolutely abandon one's prejudices and obey the interests of the country and the nation. I hope you can thoroughly change your attitude. "A" I ask you to give me a chance to consider. I can automatically write out what I know about the activities of the New Tide Society, the connection between the Communist Party and the Student Federation, and the various situations of the Continuing Education Club at Zhejiang University, etc." Then, the New Tide Society, the Student Federation, and the Council are all peripheral organizations of the Communist Party, engaging in secret activities, and they have all been described in detail as acting in concert with each other.

<h3>France's Situation Remains Precarious, Strikes Expand, Railway Traffic Severed, Schuman's Cabinet Gains Parliamentary Support</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd] France is in the midst of a wave of strikes, and has been without a government for four days. The main difficulty facing the new Prime Minister is the opposition of left-wing Socialists to any government that does not intend to continue state control of the economy. It is reported that a faction led by Socialist Party Secretary-General Mollet has made continued state control a condition for joining Schuman's cabinet. Schuman, on the other hand, is considered to be a proponent of easing state control of the economy. At the same time, the strike wave launched by the Communist Party has penetrated into the core of the French economy, with approximately one million workers on strike.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Prime Minister Schuman conducted cabinet formation talks late into the night. He stated at 4:00 AM this morning that more rapid progress is expected when the talks continue this afternoon. Earlier, former Prime Minister Blum personally came forward to persuade Socialist Party members to reconcile with Schuman on the economic policies of the new government. Blum contacted Schuman and his Socialist colleagues by phone overnight. The Socialist Party, under the leadership of its Secretary-General Mollet, seems to disagree with the views of former Prime Minister Ramadier. Ramadier is unwilling to serve as Deputy Prime Minister in charge of financial and economic affairs unless he is given the freedom to handle the responsibilities under his jurisdiction. After meeting with party leaders for seven hours, Schuman reported to President Auriol.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 22nd] Robert Schuman of the Popular Republican Movement was officially appointed Prime Minister tonight. The National Assembly passed a vote of confidence by a vote of 412 to 184, with 21 abstentions or absences. Communists and their sympathizers voted against, while the De Gaulle faction voted in favor or abstained. Earlier, Schuman declared in the Assembly that defending France would be his duty and that he would strictly distinguish between the legitimate demands of workers and the events taking place in various parts of Europe, hoping to form a new cabinet to deal with the strikes immediately. At the same time, under the leadership of the General Confederation of Labor, which is manipulated by the Communist Party, the number of strikers has exceeded 750,000. There are fears of riots breaking out in Paris tomorrow. Many trucks are full of military police, carrying guns into the city to prevent emergencies. After the public heard of the destruction of four important secret military depots and the cutting of telephone lines in suburban fortresses by rioters last night, their emotions were clearly uneasy. In addition, according to the police station, one quart of concentrated tear gas was stolen from a certain factory last night. After the explosion at the Renault car factory, two Communist workers were arrested for manufacturing bombs there. Partial strikes by national railway and merchant marine workers, as well as metallurgy, construction, coal mining, shipyards, flour mills, and school education in the Paris region, have been caught up in the vortex. Trains are completely stopped between the southeast and Paris-Lyon, and traffic north of Paris has also been severed. Sailors of merchant ships in Marseilles, Bordeaux, Nantes, and Rouen have responded to the striking workers in shipyards in major cities. Longshoremen in Le Havre are scheduled to strike tomorrow.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] The Marseilles City Council convened its first meeting today since Communist Party and De Gaulle faction members clashed ten days ago. Communist Party members withdrew from the meeting as a protest against the presence of an armed guard in the chamber.</p>
<h3>The Four Powers Have Differences of Opinion on the German Question, the Future of the Foreign Ministers' Conference is Bleak, Molotov Arrives in London via Berlin</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] London, 23rd Broadcasting: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov flew to this city from Berlin today in preparation for attending the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, which will open on Tuesday.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] The Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to open on Tuesday, but no agreement has yet been reached on a draft agenda. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France, on the one hand, and the Soviet Union, on the other, will each present an agenda. Therefore, the main task of the Foreign Ministers' Conference is to decide the order in which the items will be discussed. There is also no agreement on the report of the Council of Foreign Ministers' Deputies. Therefore, each representative may have to submit a separate report to their Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 22nd] The British Foreign Office frankly admitted that the success or failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference depends entirely on Molotov's attitude. If Mr. Molotov's attitude is more reasonable than the Soviet attitude in the Council of Deputies, Foreign Secretary Bevin intends to do his best to reach an agreement. Otherwise, the conference could break down in three days.</p>
<h3>Sokolovsky Fires the Opening Shot, Clay Expresses Regret</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] On the eve of his departure for London to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference, US Military Governor General Clay hosted a press conference, expressing regret over the statement made by Soviet Military Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky yesterday. He felt that the points made by Sokolovsky were not new and did not understand his purpose. When asked whether he was optimistic about the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference, he replied, "If I express optimism, it is because the situation of no agreement has reached an extreme, so there is a possibility of a turning point. Today, all the major powers involved have admitted that the governing bodies in Germany have actually ceased to function. This is something that has never happened before the Foreign Ministers' Conference."</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 23rd] Sokolovsky, the Soviet Military Commander-in-Chief in Germany, made a harsh attack on the Western powers at the meeting of the Allied Control Council, making people believe that the spirit of compromise will be lacking when the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference opens. Observers place more emphasis on the timing of this attack than on its content, as most of the accusations are old tunes that have already been answered by those who were attacked. What is noteworthy is that this attack was published on the eve of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and TASS immediately gave it widespread coverage. Soviet representative Smirnov of the Foreign Ministers' Deputies already stated last week that world opinion is always willing to know to what extent disarmament and the purge of Nazis have been implemented, implying that the Soviet Union will raise the issue of how Western countries are controlling Germany at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Sokolovsky has now gone a step further in condemning the failure of the three occupying authorities in the West to fulfill the Four Power resolutions, which is tantamount to foreshadowing the Soviet Union's attitude at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. A senior official of the British Control Commission has already stated, "Sokolovsky's statement is the opening shot of the Foreign Ministers' Conference."</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Accumulates Gold to Strike at the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] According to Burins, an expert on Soviet economic affairs, the Soviet Union is secretly hoarding large amounts of gold as a weapon to curb the Marshall Plan for European recovery. In an article in the current issue of "United Nations World" magazine, Burins pointed out that the Soviet Union's hoarding of gold is the "strong economic substance" behind the warning issued by Zhdanov, Secretary-General of the Communist Party Central Committee. Burins believes that the Soviet Union can establish a strict ruble zone within its sphere of influence and set its currency to the gold standard in other parts of the world. In important trade areas, it can effectively counter the US dollar and replace the British pound. This move will interfere with the US dollar's monopoly in the current international trade market and dramatically affect the price structure in the international market. The Soviet Union's Institute of World Economy has declared that many gold mines have been discovered in the Soviet Union over the past 15 years, so it has risen from the world's fifteenth-largest gold-producing country in 1926 to second place in 1936. Today, it may have risen to first place. It is estimated that the Soviet Union currently has gold worth approximately US$17 billion, only about US$5 billion less than the United States.</p>
<h3>French Franc Circulates in Saar, Soviet Side Protests</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Frankfurt, 22nd] The German News Agency of the US Military District stated that General Koenig, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in Germany, said at the Allied Control Council meeting yesterday that France has implemented the French franc in accordance with the will of the people. The British and American representatives stated that they would make a statement on this matter later, while the Soviet representative Sokolovsky expressed protest against France's presentation to the Allied Control Council as a fait accompli and stated that it would be followed soon with an investigation.</p>
<h3>Greece Requests Italian Ships</h3>
<p>Former Territorial Investigation Committee to Listen to Opinions of Local Italians</p>
<p>[Reuters, Athens, 22nd] The Athens News Agency stated that Greece will request to share in Italian naval vessels when four naval experts meet in Rome on December 1 to discuss the distribution of Italian ships.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] The four foreign ministers' representatives discussing the former Italian territories recently decided that the four-power committee investigating the former Italian territories must listen to the opinions of Italian immigrants in the area. The manner of listening shall be determined by the investigation committee. The representatives also decided that the opinions raised by Abyssinia, Italy, and Egypt should be handed over to the investigation committee for investigation to determine whether there are any inconsistencies with the facts. The representatives also acknowledged the documents of the governments of the related countries and resolved to notify the related countries in January of the date for attending the meeting to present their opinions. The Council of Foreign Ministers' Deputies will not meet again before the end of the Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<h3>US House Subcommittee Drafts Conditions for US Foreign Aid, Recommends Establishment of Dedicated Foreign Aid Agency</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The US House Committee on Foreign Aid Plans recently released its preliminary report, outlining conditions for countries receiving assistance. The report explains that while these conditions are specifically tailored for Western Europe, the general principles listed therein can also be applied to other countries requiring US assistance in the future.</p>
<p>The committee recommends that, in order to meet the genuine needs of recipient countries as early as possible, restore their economies as quickly as possible, and avoid placing an excessive burden on the US economy, the following points must be considered when formulating or implementing any aid plan: Recipient countries should correct their fiscal, financial, and monetary weaknesses in order to stabilize foreign exchange rates and restore the credibility of their currencies; Recipient countries should strive to increase food and material production to address their fundamental domestic needs; Recipient countries should promote the economic exchange of their own goods and labor in order to effectively allocate and utilize their own and foreign resources, while also seeking to reduce foreign exchange controls, commercial quotas, and other measures that hinder trade; Countries other than the United States that can provide assistance should cooperate to the greatest extent possible; Encourage and facilitate private sector engagement in emergency actions, which are currently handled by the government in this crisis; Recipient countries should fully and publicly disclose the use, source, nature, and quantity of US assistance. The committee also recommends the establishment of a new federal agency called the Emergency Foreign Reconstruction Bureau to implement the aid plan, with an executive committee for each country, including representatives from both the United States and the recipient country; In addition, a Foreign Aid Committee should be established, comprising the Secretary of State and other cabinet members, to advise and consult the President on aid plans and policies.</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] It was learned today that the Senate is expected to approve President Truman's European Emergency Relief Act next week, but the domestic price controls and long-term foreign aid proposals are still pending. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg is scheduled to appear on the 24th, requesting the rapid allocation of $597 million to assist France, Italy, and Austria in resisting the dual threats of political turmoil and starvation, and to allow Congress sufficient time to conduct a thorough and detailed review of the Marshall Plan's long-term aid program for the reconstruction of sixteen Western European countries after the bill's passage. According to Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges, the committee will investigate US food supplies before voting on the emergency aid bill in order to carefully consider the needs of France, Italy, and Austria.</p>
<h3>Turbulent French Political Situation Special Translation by This Newspaper's Editorial Department</h3>
<p>The fear that American aid may come too late, perhaps too late to save France from collapse, is growing daily. Moderate elements in France are deliberately slowing down the pace of recovery in an attempt to curb inflation, as recovery requires money. However, this plan is not easy to gain popular support and is extremely difficult or even impossible to implement. The Communist Party is leading strikes, anti-communists are hoarding wheat and gold as political capital, and moderates are losing ground.</p>
<p>The severity of the French crisis can be gleaned from a cable from the Paris correspondent of the "World Report Weekly," who said:</p>
<p>Although wage standards are the same as during the Charles de Gaulle era, prices have risen sharply. Official food prices rose by almost 25 percent in August alone. Industrial products, raw materials, and dairy products are almost eight times higher than in 1938. However, official prices are not representative of market prices. For example, white bread cannot be bought at all on the market at official prices; the black market price is several times higher than the official price.</p>
<p>Tax evasion has reached its peak. Most of the government's revenue comes from workers' income taxes, as this tax is deducted directly from wages. As a result, the burden on labor is increasing, making wage increases unavoidable. The government's greatest difficulty is that it cannot implement any effective reforms before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The low value of the franc reflects the weakness of the French financial economy. France's gold reserves have fallen from a high of $2.709 billion in 1939 to $544 million. However, as reserves have decreased, inflation has increased. According to statistics, the amount of banknotes issued in France in 1939 was 151 billion francs, which has now increased to 874 billion francs.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, the government estimated that the French could purchase $1.14 billion in national bonds, but the bonds did not sell, and the maturing bonds had to be paid in cash. France now has no domestic deposits and no US dollars abroad to meet daily expenditures. In the 1948 fiscal year, the country's revenue is approximately $5.5 billion, while expenditures are approximately $8 billion. In order to balance the budget, major austerity measures must be taken.</p>
<p>According to the above estimates, the amount of austerity measures is approximately $2.5 billion. Some austerity measures that can be implemented without parliamentary restrictions are already being implemented. The number of officers in the army will be reduced by 15 percent; the construction of a new aircraft carrier has been halted; and only half of those who should be undergoing military service training will be called up before January 1.</p>
<p>If approved by parliament, nationally funded post-war reconstruction will be temporarily suspended; compensation for wartime losses to the public will be postponed; reconstruction work in various regions should be funded locally; bank loans will be regulated; the interest rate on loans from the Bank of France has been increased from 1.75 percent to 2.5 percent; loans will not be available to those without legitimate needs; and merchants must sell their hoarded goods on the market before borrowing money.</p>
<p>This plan is welcomed by Washington, as US government officials have always believed that the French are spending too much money, but it has met with resistance in France. Workers are demanding wage increases and opposing the rise of the de Gaulle faction, leading to numerous strikes, which may paralyze the entire French economy. The hoarding of wheat by farmers and the hoarding of gold by capitalists make inflation even more difficult to control.</p>
<p>If the moderates cannot strive to maintain their position until American aid arrives, then France may see a new regime emerge, and the characteristics of this regime will certainly not be moderate. (Translated from "World Report Weekly")</p>
<h3>Financial Agreement Established for British-American Merged Zone in Germany All Occupation Costs in Both Zones Borne by the United States</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Source from Gouwei: All unresolved points in the negotiations between Britain and the United States on revising the rules of the British-American merged zone in Germany have been agreed upon in principle. Representatives from both sides are working on organizing the revised text, which is expected to be formally announced simultaneously in London and Washington next week. The agreements reached include: The British side agrees to convert the surplus of approximately £18 million in the joint export department accounts of the merged zone into US dollars, but to avoid an immediate reduction in Britain's US dollar reserves, sudden full acceptance will not be required. From January 1, 1948, the United States will bear all US dollar costs for both zones, so the United States will have more say in the disposal of funds in the two zones. However, the principle of equal responsibility between Britain and the United States for the administrative responsibilities of the merged zone will not be changed. A definite proportion of goods to be imported by Britain from the sterling zone into the British-American merged zone is stipulated. It is reported that this agreement does not take into account the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, so if the Foreign Ministers' Conference fails and France decides to join the merger, a new approach will have to be drafted.</p>
<h3>British Deputy Prime Minister Morrison Says British Economic Situation Improving Churchill Condemns Labor Government for Misleading the Country</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Yorkshire, 23rd] Deputy Prime Minister Morrison delivered a speech during the encouragement production movement here, claiming that various signs indicate that Britain will soon be able to overcome its current difficulties. It is generally believed that Morrison's speech this time is the most optimistic among the statements made by various cabinet ministers.</p>
<p>He said: Although there is a shortage of food and raw materials, and there are still many difficulties, there are signs of progress in the most important parts of the entire economic front, namely basic and export industries.

<h3>Cominform to Issue Important Declaration European Communist Leaders in Frequent Contact</h3>
<p>[United Press, Prague, 23rd] Political observers here are closely awaiting a major new strategy declaration from the Cominform on the European "Cold War" tactics. Observers say important talks are underway to adjust the Communist Party's policies on recent international events.</p>
<p>Reliable sources report that Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Rákosi was in Moscow earlier this week. French Communist Party leader Thorez has been in Moscow for an extended stay since early November. Yugoslav President Tito appeared in Sarajevo on the 23rd, and plans to meet with Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov in Sofia on the 23rd have been postponed. Dimitrov returned to Sofia on the 20th after a "long vacation." Observers say that the time has come for the Cominform to issue a declaration, as the following developments have occurred since the bureau adjourned in Poland on September 28: The US Special Congress will vote on the Marshall Plan; The Four Foreign Ministers Conference will be held in London; The French and Italian Communist Parties have stepped up anti-government strikes and unrest; After clearing out opposition figures such as Mikolajczyk, the governments of Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland participating in the Cominform in Eastern Europe have consolidated their rule; The United States has strengthened its aid to Greece. Communist sources believe that Polish Workers' Party (i.e., Communist Party) Secretary-General Gomulka is the most promising candidate to serve as the permanent chairman of the Belgrade Cominform.

The Cominform's first plan is to publish a publication containing Party instructions and speeches, and editorial and printing departments have already begun work in the Yugoslav capital this month.</p>
<h3>Current UN General Assembly Session Lasts Ten Weeks US-Soviet Divide Becomes More Apparent China Announces Support for Partition of Holy Land</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 23rd] As the United Nations General Assembly draws to a close, the consensus of most delegates is that the main achievement of this session has been the further division between the Soviet Union and Western countries. Most delegates believe that the votes in the General Assembly over the past ten weeks clearly indicate that in the showdown between the economic and ideological power of the United States and the Soviet Union, at least three-quarters of the countries support the United States.</p>
<p>The atmosphere is somber at the close of the General Assembly, and the number of delegates privately pessimistic about the future of the United Nations is increasing daily. The Soviet Union seems to be gradually separating itself from the actual work of the United Nations, while still showing no inclination to formally withdraw from the alliance. The Balkan Observer Group, the Little General Assembly, and the United Nations Commission on Korea have caused three major divisions. The United States initiated these three proposals, and despite the strongest opposition from the Soviet Union, they were eventually passed by the General Assembly, while the Soviet Union announced that it would boycott them all. Most delegates agree that without Soviet participation, the United Nations is unlikely to achieve concrete results in the three areas of the Balkans, Korea, and the Little General Assembly. The only agreement that the US and the Soviet Union were able to reach was on the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states.</p>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd] China announced today at the United Nations General Assembly that it supports the partition plan for Palestine, ending its hesitant attitude. Hsu Wei-chun said that while partition is not a completely satisfactory solution, this is due to the extreme opposition from the Arabs, but the partition policy is the only way to solve the problem and may be successful. He said that peace in the Middle East depends on the early resolution of the Palestinian issue, and he hopes that time will allow partition to gradually take effect.</p>
<p>He said that China was unwilling to announce its support for partition until the last minute, as it continued to hope that a reconciliation could be achieved between the Jews and Arabs. However, reconciliation seems impossible at present, so China must express its position on the decision-making. He said that if this session of the General Assembly does not take action, then near peace will be impossible.</p>
<h3>Mass Grave of 10,000 People Discovered in US Zone of Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Hammelburg, US Zone of Germany, 22nd] Six large graves containing bodies of sixty-eight nationalities have been discovered in a forest near Hammelburg in the central US zone. Officials from the International Refugee Organization who saw these mass graves said that 11,000 of the bodies were buried individually, presumably due to death from malnutrition and other causes.</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Nationalization of Coal Mines How Many Days Have Members of Parliament Fought Again? Opposition Parties Blame Speaker for Negligence</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] The ruling party and opposition parties in Japan continued to argue over the coal mine nationalization bill in the House of Representatives this afternoon, resulting in a fight. First, Liberal Party member Cho-taro Imamura attempted to cross the parliamentary guards and confront House Speaker Komakichi Matsuoka. Ten guards stepped forward to block Imamura, and another Liberal Party member took the opportunity to rush to the podium, causing great chaos during the meeting. Order was not restored until after a few minutes.</p>
<p>Since the fight that occurred during the discussion of the coal mine nationalization bill on the 20th, guards have been stationed in front of the House of Representatives podium. In addition, Democratic Party Executive Committee member Tokuya Koyama voted against the coal mine nationalization bill along with the Liberal Party, so the Democratic Party revoked his membership on the Executive Committee.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The report of the chairman of the Committee on Industry and Mining, Shiro Ito, continued at the plenary session of the House of Representatives from 8:30 pm on the 22nd. The government seems to be planning to submit the amendments of the three ruling parties on the 24th, immediately begin voting, and forcibly pass them with the absolute majority of the ruling parties. In addition, the three ruling parties, the Socialists, Democrats, and National Cooperation Party, agreed on the night of the 22nd to successively submit important bills such as the Anti-Monopoly Law and supplementary budgets to the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 23rd, and want to pass them all at once. However, the opposition parties, centered on the Liberal Party, are considering measures to prevent this. Furthermore, the Liberal Party held a meeting of members at 7:00 pm on the 22nd, believing that the chaos at the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 22nd was the responsibility of the Speaker, and that the matters resolved should be legally invalid, and decided to pursue the responsibility of Speaker Matsuoka.</p>
<h3>Iran Responds to Soviet Protest</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 23rd] The Iranian cabinet discussed today the reply to the Soviet protest letter drafted by Prime Minister Sultan Suleimanov. According to people close to the Prime Minister, the Iranian government's response refuted the main points of the Soviet protest letter. The Soviet Union pointed out that Sultan Suleimanov should not have waited a year to submit the oil agreement to the parliament. The Iranian government replied that there was no parliament in existence during that year, and that the report on the oil agreement negotiation was not a legislative proposal of the Iranian government. The Iranian government replied that the Iranian law promulgated in December 1944 prohibits officials from negotiating transfers of rights with foreign countries, so the Prime Minister had no right to submit a legislative proposal to the parliament. The Soviet Union pointed out that Britain already enjoys oil rights in Iran, so Iran is discriminating against the Soviet Union. The Iranian government replied that the transfer of oil rights to Britain was made when Iran did not yet have a constitution, so it was impossible to seek the opinion of the people.</p>
<h3>Yokosuka and Three Other Ports to Be Transferred to US Military Use Both US and Japan Express Enthusiastic Approval</h3>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] The US House Armed Services Committee has recommended that once a peace treaty with Japan is signed, Yokosuka, Sasebo, and Kure ports be transferred to the United States for use as naval bases. American land, sea and air forces, and the Japanese side, all enthusiastically approved this proposal on the 23rd. A naval authority pointed out: The Yokosuka base has already proven to be the most valuable base for naval operations in the Far East, and is currently able to supply the needs of the entire fleet. The Americanization and democratization of Yokosuka also have a major impact on the Japanese people, as the port has been under the secret control of the Japanese Navy for many years. Before and during the war, most of the Japanese people were excluded from this area. Now, the US military has opened it up and begun to transform this dark underground city into a clean and bright naval base. Thousands of Japanese people are proud of the construction of this place according to American standards, and the opening of the base has provided jobs for thousands of Japanese people, and the economic situation of the city has been turned from danger to safety.</p>

<h3>Illiterate "Dian Qiuxiang"</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday was a weekend holiday, and it was the last half day of the election. All the candidates made their final efforts, so the situation was particularly tense. Staff from various agencies and civil service personnel all went to vote during the weekend holiday, so voters were more enthusiastic than in the previous two days. Most polling stations already had a large number of voters going to vote around 8:00 am in the morning, which gradually thinned out towards noon. Order was still good in the districts and there were no major disputes at the end of the day at 12 o'clock. The number of votes in the district elections yesterday was about 50% higher than on the second day. In the western district, there are many shantytowns. There were many people who went to the polling stations to fulfill their civic obligations yesterday morning, but because most of them were illiterate, they could only use the help of the administrators to point to any one of the candidate's names, and then ask others to write the election ticket. This special election method is called "Dian Qiuxiang" by students. The close relationship between education and democracy is thought-provoking.</p>

<h3>Scalpers Still Active at Movie Theaters "Vote for Me"</h3>
<p>Various movie theaters in the city have repeatedly established penalty rules and cooperated with the police to arrest scalpers due to their activity, but to no avail. The activity is particularly rampant whenever a new film is released. The leader of the scalpers, Xiong Yi, is also using various disguises to avoid police attention, sometimes wearing a melton Zhongshan suit, looking like a civil servant, lining up to buy tickets, or selling them publicly with a "treating-guests" attitude. Since the new war film "Sea Bee Heroes" was released at the Carlton and Lido theaters the day before yesterday, the audience has been extremely crowded every day, and the scalpers have even engaged in large-scale hoarding. In the midst of full houses, the scalpers have almost completely booked the theaters for the next few days. Movie fans vainly line up, and in the end, they still have to ask the scalpers to "vote for me," but they all grind their teeth in hatred.</p>

<h3>Banquet Inspection Still Many [Issues] Tomorrow Meeting to Discuss New Ya's Embarrassment Insulting Juvenile Police Will Be Fined and Ordered to Suspend Business for Several Days</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] It has been several days since the juvenile police team reported on the simple banquet inspection. The Social Bureau will convene a review meeting tomorrow to discuss technical issues in the implementation. Yesterday, the reporter visited several members of the juvenile police team and the team leader, Hu Bangwei. According to them, the general situation has been smooth since the inspection work began. Most diners and shop owners can accept their persuasion, but an unpleasant dispute occurred at the New Ya Hotel that day. Because the store sold luxury foods such as shark fin and sea cucumber, the juvenile police gave advice that was not listened to. While inspecting the cold storage room, the store's chefs and tea waiters surrounded them and smeared oil powder on the juvenile police's clothes. The juvenile police wanted to call and report to the bureau, but were also prevented. Later, Hu Team Leader and the Lao Zha branch received a report and sent personnel to resolve the situation. The main perpetrator, tea waiter Lu Pei, No. 73, has been detained by the Lao Zha branch. The New Ya Restaurant's violation of frugality has been reported to the competent authority and will be punished with a suspension of business for several days. As for the main difficulties in the inspection, it lies in the imperfect or inconsistent nature of certain laws and regulations. For example: Regarding luxury goods such as sea cucumber and shark fin, the Social Bureau has a regulation that "they must not be sold again after the stock is sold out," but it is difficult to ascertain when the stock is sold out. It is difficult to determine whether what is currently sold in restaurants is stock or new goods. Small account issues. The Social Bureau's regulations are that no extra demands may be made outside of the 20% service charge. However, the police law in the police department stipulates that there must be no small accounts other than the official account. Then, which one should be followed during implementation? The price of a frugal banquet is stipulated not to exceed 1.2 million yuan per table and not to exceed 120,000 yuan per person, but sometimes there are eleven or twelve people sitting at one table. In this case, 120,000 yuan per person does not exceed the limit, but the total amount per table exceeds the limit. All of these are difficulties in the implementation, which will be raised for discussion at tomorrow's meeting. The juvenile police are currently living in the Caohejing Reformatory because the police station's dormitory has not yet been settled. They come to the urban area at 10:00 every morning and are sent back to Caohejing at 10:00 in the evening.</p>
<p>(Another news) It is heard that the kitchens of Luo Deji, Ma Leji, and other four restaurants have been found to have violated the frugality regulations and will be given warnings separately.</p>

<h3>Blind Education Facilities Fail to Adapt to Society</h3>
<p>An Echo of a Blind Person with Unlimited Grief Hope for More Spiritual and Material Guidance and Assistance</p>
<p>The special article "Experiencing the World Entirely Through Touch" in this newspaper on November 10 used facts to prove that we blind people, with innate talents and acquired knowledge, perform no less than ordinary people, prompting society to pay attention to the development of blind education and careers, so as to save the more than five million blind compatriots, all of whom can get the opportunity to recycle waste. However, can we blind people who have received this special education be adapted to the real society? There is an unspeakable feeling! The special article in this newspaper mentioned Mr. Song Guanlin, Zhang Peixin, and Wu Guobiao, who are outstanding figures in the Chinese blind community. Mr. Song is the private secretary of Liu Hongsheng, and Mr. Zhang is the editor of Da Mei Daily. They are both nearing sixty years old and use English and American literature and thinking skills as their lifelong way out. Mr. Wu is a rising star in the blind community. He returned to China after studying in the United States and advocated the Chinese Blind School. Can this organization get the sympathy of the government and society? I think Mr. Wu must have unlimited sadness in his heart.</p>
<h3>Blind People in Europe and the United States Are Treated as One</h3>
<p>Blind education and careers cannot be effective without government leadership and social guidance. For example, in the United States and other countries, there are blind bureaus and their welfare organizations, braille books, newspaper publications, special equipment supply, national life, and regarded as one. But where are Chinese blind people! If you lose your eyes and learn to be a fortune teller, you can make a living, and if you know a few braille characters and learn some new skills for blind people (such as stringing rattan, knitting nets, music, typing, etc.), you can't even get enough to eat, or even if you are proficient in vocational skills and proficient in European and American literature, no one will ask you for advice. The crux of this problem is that the country is in trouble, people's hearts are uneasy, education facilities are not as good as their reputation, and there are more and more unemployed people, who cannot take care of our waste products, and the failure of blind education facilities to adapt to the real society for decades is the biggest mistake. This problem is quite serious. Ten years under the window is ignorant</p>
<h3>Ten Years Under the Window is Ignorant</h3>
<p>Literacy education is the foundation of education, and writing is a tool for life. European and American characters are all composed of letters. Therefore, the braille invented by the French blind man Brail uses a copper plate to cast squares, and the shape of each square is like the six dots on the dice. He uses a stylus to punch out convex dots on a piece of paper from the square. The number of convex dots and the difference in position can represent each letter. We rely on touch to stroke the convex dots to recognize the word formed by those letters, and we can pronounce the word and understand the meaning of the word. As for our Chinese braille, it was created by foreign missionaries. At first, the blind school in Peiping incorporated all the pronunciations into 408 sound mothers. Later, blind children's schools in Shanghai and other places created and formulated 50 letters based on phonetic symbols for blind people to use. However, the Chinese characters are based on the six books as the body, and not on sounds and letters. You must recognize the characters before you can pronounce the words and understand the meaning of the words. However, we blind people stroke a few phonetic symbols. After ten years under the window, we are still ignorant. How can we recognize the world?</p>
<h3>Can the Blind Career Be Improved</h3>
<p>Sure enough, this kind of "dot-shaped" word can never represent the shape of Chinese characters, making Chinese blind people read books but still not literate. But can the future improvement use scientific methods so that we blind people, in addition to stroking a few phonetic symbols, can also stroke the real characters, and feel them at a touch, and in addition to using English typewriters, we can also use Chinese typewriters, and then extend it to the development of blind people's careers, from the city to the countryside, as common as fortune tellers. I am very happy to follow the pioneers of the blind community, such as Song, Zhang, and Wu, to work hard on ideal research on this major issue. At the same time, I also ask people from all walks of life for spiritual and material assistance to live up to the praise of this newspaper "Experiencing the World Entirely Through Touch."

<h3>Cousin Playing with a Gun Auxiliary Police Killed in Tragic Accident With a Loud Bang Brains Splattered</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Sun Xilin, a current auxiliary police officer of the Xincheng Police Branch, aged twenty-six, residing at No. 14, Lane 1947, Biande Road, got up shortly after 8:40 yesterday morning. His cousin, Wang Sanmei, who was only twelve years old, came to Sun's room to play. She saw a service pistol placed under the pillow, which aroused her curiosity for a while. She took it out to play with it, and Sun did not stop her. He did not realize that he had loaded the bullets when Sun was on duty the night before. Wang Sanmei was young and ignorant, and soon turned the machine twist. With a loud bang, the bullet hit Sun's head, and his brains splattered. He immediately fell to the ground. Wang was extremely frightened and shouted. After his family arrived, they urgently called an ambulance to take him to the hospital, but he died on the way because of the injury to a vital part. After receiving the report, the Xincheng Police Branch sent personnel to the scene of the incident to investigate and took Wang Sanmei to the bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3>Demolition Incident on Tianmu Road Residents Generally Complain Only One-Tenth of the Announced Demolition Fee and Promises</h3>
<p>[Special Article by Our Newspaper] The demolition incident on Tianmu Road is a rather troublesome issue in Shanghai's municipal administration. According to the residents of Tianmu Road, when the residents' representatives petitioned the Municipal Council, Vice Chairman Xu told the representatives that the Municipal Government was preparing 900 million to assist in the demolition and relocation, and there was also a rumor in the council that 700 million would be added to repay the land price. The representatives returned and relayed the intention, and the decision to demolish in six months was promised by the residents. However, on November 16, the Bureau of Public Works suddenly announced a deadline for demolition. In the total amount of 90 million to be collected urgently, the lowest demolition fee was only 12,000 yuan per household. This made things stall. Petitions, kneeling requests, weeping, and finally shouting slogans such as "Whoever comes to demolish the house, fights with whoever" came out. It is said that the reason for this is that the announced demolition fee is only one-tenth of the previous promise.</p>
<p>Business Relies Entirely on Train Passengers</p>
<h3>Business Relies Entirely on Train Passengers</h3>
<p>Let's look at the other side of the issue: If the authorities had fulfilled the conditions rumored by the council and actually allocated 1.6 billion for demolition and relocation, would the residents of Tianmu Road have been silent and obeyed? To judge this issue, we must first recognize the situation of Tianmu Road: A total of more than 90 buildings, about 180 households, were listed for demolition on Tianmu Road this time. Among them, in addition to ordinary households, there are 60 shops, 9 of which are cigarette shops that specialize in doing business with fellow villagers who take the train; more than 10 large and small transportation companies are undoubtedly closely related to the business of the station; nearly 10 hotels undoubtedly entrust the source of their lives to the dozens of train passengers every day; not to mention the rest of the restaurants and teahouses. Given that nearly half of the residents maintain a close relationship with the station in terms of location, even with a large amount of subsidies, would they be willing to demolish and relocate? The cry of "Swear to coexist with the house" will inevitably be shouted among them.</p>
<h3>Bearing Humiliation and Insult, Breathing a Sigh of Relief</h3>
<p>Many households on Tianmu Road have lived there for more than thirty years. They pointed out that Mr. Li Huiwu used to live in Qingxiangli. When he presided over the difficulty in Zhabei in the Xinhai year, the first righteous banner of restoration was erected in Qingxiangli, and the comrades who launched the uprising before and after the difficulty were all lurking in Qingxiangli. If the Standing Committee commemorates the martyrs, respects virtue and rewards meritorious deeds, this area should not be demolished; they also said that during the eight years of the War of Resistance, Tianmu Road was blocked by the enemy for four years (during the occupation). The residents were humiliated and closed their doors to starve, expecting the sun to shine again. Just by this point, the loyal heart of the lonely minister, the authorities should not demolish it; they also said that many houses on Tianmu Road were destroyed by enemy bullets during the August 13th incident. After the victory, the residents requested reconstruction, and the authorities allowed them to build houses on the spot, and paved water pipes and connected electric wires for them. Now the city appearance has been rectified, and they are fortunate to have taken a breath of relief. How can the authorities bear to order demolition again!</p>
<h3>Occupying the Road on the North Side, Expanding the Road on the South Side</h3>
<p>Speaking of these reasons, they also raised the incident of occupying land to build pressure on both roads: Tianmu Road was called "Boundary Road" in the old concession era, facing Xinmin Road across the iron fence. During the occupation, the road bureau under the enemy's rule gradually extended the houses to Xinmin Road. After the victory, the road bureau built more and more. Although the iron fence has been demolished, Xinmin Road is completely unrecognizable. The road surface, which was originally wider than Nanjing Road, is no longer what it used to be. They believed that the responsibility lies with the road bureau, so they specifically proposed the point of "occupying the road on the north side to build houses and demolishing houses on the south side to widen the road" when petitioning, asking what the Standing Committee meant.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Factory Sighs That There Are No Exceptions</h3>
<p>It is said that the real estate on Tianmu Road is all owned by Shanghai Commercial Bank, Xinhua Bank, Fuyuan Bank, etc., but they did not express their attitude towards this demolition and land concession incident. Among the rows of demolished houses, the most indignant was a Hui Zhong cigarette factory. He said that we pay 8 billion in cigarette taxes every month, and the contribution to the country cannot be considered small, but the authorities have made no exceptions for him in the face of the imminent crisis; another Zhonghe Transportation Company should receive 6.05 million yuan in demolition fees this time, which is considered lucky on Tianmu Road, but according to his statistics, the demolition loss will be 50 times the cost of this subsidy.</p>
<p>There were originally two cement bunkers at both ends of Tianmu Road. The residents in the concession era called them "forts," but now they have become relics. In the several national crises in the past 20 years, this road has always been at the forefront of the flames of war. Many houses still have scars left on them. If the demolition proposal is realized in the future, this road will gradually disappear in the memories of Shanghai citizens.</p>
<h3>300 Cars Owned 13 Routes Opened The Public Transportation Company Operates Miserably Preparing to Celebrate the Second Anniversary</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Transportation Company Preparatory Committee, sponsored by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, is preparing for the second anniversary of the company's traffic. The company took over the enemy and puppet urban transportation company in September of the 34th year, and after sorting it out, selected 51 old and dilapidated vehicles that could barely be used for driving, and first opened the first circular route on December 10. It operated miserably and tried its best. Then it expanded and opened the second and third routes, which relied on the unity of the staff to overcome the difficulties. Subsequently, in April of the 35th year, it obtained a loan from the Bank of Communications and purchased 100 T234 Dodge trucks from the Materials Supply Bureau. After the company's technical personnel designed and modified them, some were converted into wooden temporary bodies, and some were converted into the streamlined new vehicles that are running on Road 10 today. The company was able to gradually expand its business.</p>
<p>Up to now, it has 300 vehicles, including 61 streamlined new vehicles (20 of which are being modified and can be completed by the end of the year). The number of routes has also been opened to as many as 13, with about 200,000 passengers daily. Currently, the company has 2,000 employees, of which more than 1,500 are driving personnel, and the rest are technical and other personnel. Welfare facilities are perfect, allowing employees to work with peace of mind. In terms of organization, Zhao Cengjue of the Bureau of Public Works also serves as the director, and other staff members such as Zhang Mingzhu, Niu Zequan, Wu Jinqing, Wang Zongshan, Shen Sanduo, Zhang Deqing, and Ding Weitang are all well-known figures in the domestic transportation industry. The senior officials of the company have a meeting once a week to promote business operations, which is personally presided over by Director Zhao, and the opinions of various units are widely accepted, and the company's policies are discussed and decided, fully implementing democratization. It is heard that the company is currently preparing to add the 14th and 15th routes, which can be opened within the year. The preparations for the second anniversary of the opening of traffic on the 10th of next month have been concrete, and meritorious employees will be awarded medals separately, and Mayor Wu will be invited to preside over the event.</p>
<h3>Youth Association Holds Voluntary Leaders Meeting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The annual voluntary leaders meeting of the Chinese Christian Youth Association was held yesterday morning at 9:00 AM at the Zhongxi Girls' School on Jiangsu Road. More than 200 guests attended, including Wu Yifang, Li Zhaobao, Hong Shishen, and Zhang Wei. First, a morning worship was held, and De William, director of the American office of the International Propaganda Association, gave a sermon. Then, Dr. Wu Yifang, president of Jinling Women's University, gave a speech on "China's Grassroots Construction and the Youth Association." The meeting continued in the afternoon, divided into five groups: "Youth Morality and Religious Belief," "Production Education and Technical Training," "Youth Health and Proper Entertainment," "Democratic Education and Collective Life," and "International Friendship and World Peace," for separate discussions. The attending members made many suggestions for the future work of the association in accordance with these five items, and it was decided that voluntary leaders from all walks of life would jointly promote it with the association. Finally, the students of Yucai School performed Chinese folk music and dance, and the meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Six Policemen Loyal to Their Duties and Diligent in Their Work Commended by the President</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Wu Zhenyue, Zhang Kaiyun, Dai Rude, Tian Shunrong, Xiao Wenbin, and Xi Hanyou, six court police officers of the Shanghai Local Court Detention Center, escorted 60 convicted prisoners to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison for execution at 3:00 PM on the 21st of last month. On the way, three prisoners, Zhu Gaojin, etc., suddenly jumped out of the car and fled. Wu and others bravely chased and captured the three prisoners. The incident was heard by President Cha Liangjian, who believed that the police officers were diligent in their duties, loyal and commendable, so he specially summoned them yesterday, gave them encouragement, and increased their salaries by one grade from this month to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Fang Zhichao Hired as Consultant to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Mr. Fang Zhichao, the current president of the Dazhong Evening News, was originally the Director of the Administrative Office when Commander Xuan Tiewu was the Director of the Municipal Police Bureau. For the past two years, he has made many contributions to police administration. In the summer, in order to participate in the election of legislative members, he resigned from his official position according to law, presided over the Dazhong Evening News, and managed the voluntary police affairs. Currently, the number of voluntary police in the city has expanded to more than 15,000, assisting professional police in promoting government laws and regulations, and their contribution is great. Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and Director Yu are extremely concerned. Mayor Wu also hired Mr. Fang as a consultant for consultation at any time.</p>
<h3>Suburban Cars Illegally Carry Passengers Authorities Are Discussing Elimination Measures</h3>
<p>Suburban long-distance bus companies and municipal public transportation companies have petitioned the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to ban the illegal carrying of passengers by many buses, which hinders their business. The bureau believes that illegal passengers mostly have agencies and organizations as their background, so it is quite difficult to deal with. The police bureau and other agencies are currently discussing elimination measures. In addition, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works believes that soldiers often do not buy tickets when taking buses, and it is estimated that the ticket revenue of various transportation companies is reduced by at least one-third. In order to take into account the business of various companies and maintain expenses, the bureau is currently drafting preferential measures for soldiers to take buses, which will be implemented in the near future.</p>
<h3>A Tour of the Sinan Road Detention Center More People Than Lunch Boxes Eating Becomes a Big Problem Most Prisoners Get By on Matchboxes</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The reporter visited the Sinan Road Detention Center the day before yesterday, and the main points of the overview of the detention center are recorded below:</p>
<p>The detention center was originally the former French Concession Prison, completed in the third year of the Qing Dynasty Xuantong. It was changed to the Shanghai Second Special Zone Prison in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, and was changed to the puppet "Shanghai Local Court Detention Center" during the Shanghai occupation in the 31st year. It was taken over after the victory in September of the 34th year and renamed its current name. There are a total of 303 prison rooms, with 1,934 male prisoners, 447 female prisoners, 9 foreign prisoners, and 91 juvenile prisoners. According to statistics,</p>
<h3>Theft and Opium</h3>
<p>are the most common. There are two meals per person per day. In months with 31 days, 17.5 liang of rice is served per day, and in months with 30 days, 18.4 liang of rice is served per day. Four liang of vegetables are served per day. Foreign prisoners receive 28 liang of bread per person per day and a bowl of foreign potato and beef soup. There is a big problem with eating. There are more than 2,000 prisoners, but only more than 600 lunch boxes, so that the food is cold for those who eat last. Foreign prisoners are treated better and have beds.</p>
<h3>Flush Toilet</h3>
<p>The murderer of Yu Shengxiao, Que Li Aque, sat on his bed reading a book. Each cell had a toilet, and one prisoner was using it as a desk, hunched over it writing. Each prisoner was allowed to see family members twice a week. Most prisoners were gluing matchboxes; skilled ones could glue five hundred a day, while new prisoners could glue three hundred. Those who didn't work</p>
<h3>Would Be Punished</h3>
<p>In the sewing workshop, there used to be a released skilled worker from the Hongxiang Company named He Zikui, who was detained in the detention center for indecent behavior, and he made very good clothing styles. The current inmate workers' craftsmanship is much worse. When talking about this, the current guards still miss him. Among the prisoners in the detention center, there are desperadoes, known as "Dragon Heads," who often cause trouble. Therefore, Xu Lixun and more than sixty others were transferred to Shanghai Prison. Last time, in Shanghai Prison,</p>
<h3>A Riot Occurred</h3>
<p>The Dragon Heads Shi Liangen, Zhou Xinglong, and others were also transferred to the detention center. Having a new location, the "Dragon Heads'" prestige could no longer be exerted. There are rules in the detention center that women cannot enter the third iron gate, and men cannot enter the women's prison, but journalists are an exception. Minister Xie once invited a foreign monk "Father Paul" to preach in the detention center. He was a Jesuit priest and professor at Aurora University, who spoke fluent Chinese. He held a Bible in his hand and preached in front of each iron window, appearing very enthusiastic. According to him, many prisoners believe in Christianity.</p>
<p>Bless everyone who has committed a crime, that they may reform and be renewed, and enter heaven—Amen!</p>
<h3>Thief Qiu Guicheng Was Originally a Murderer; Police Academy Students File a Petition Requesting Justice for Their Brother</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Thief Qiu Guicheng, on the 30th of last month, along with Ma Yijian and others at large, went to the home of Chou Lizhong, a squatter living at 1394 Central Road, and stole more than ten pieces of lumber, which were hidden at the home of Xu Panshi, who was aware of the situation. Chou reported the crime to the police, and Qiu was arrested and sent to the District Court, where Judge Wang Jiachuo sentenced him to seven months' imprisonment. Later, Xu Jun, a student in the Fourth Team of the Central Police Academy, learned that Qiu had previously murdered his brother, Xu Yinzhang, and yesterday submitted a petition to the District Court requesting a separate investigation and prosecution. The petition stated in brief: Qiu once served as the head of the Third Regiment of the puppet "Military Affairs Commission Special Envoy Office" in 1942, colluding with Japanese Major General Fubu, leading tens of thousands of enemy and puppet troops, and routing the 84th Army stationed in Huaibin, Fubu, and other places. They expanded the army to clear the countryside and forced Xu Yinzhang, who served in the 84th Army, to surrender in Fengguzhen, Funing. Xu refused, arousing Qiu's anger, and Xu and his accompanying soldier, Chen Zhong, were shot dead with machine guns, and two Mauser pistols were seized. At that time, the town mayor and self-defense captain of the town witnessed the incident, which can be used as proof. Therefore, it is requested that an investigation be conducted according to law to redress the grievance and maintain the law. After receiving the petition, the District Court has handed it over to Judge Wang for handling.</p>
<h3>Tram and Military Vehicle Collide; Passengers Injured by Impact</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday at 2:30 PM, a collision occurred between a tram and a military vehicle on the Bund of Nanjing Road. At the time, a British-owned Route 1 tram was traveling east from the west, and when it reached the intersection of Nanjing Road, it turned and collided with military vehicle number 02809, which was approaching from the opposite direction and failed to give way. Ma Yi (number 19), a passenger in the military vehicle, was injured in the head by the impact and was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The driver of the accident was taken to the police station for interrogation by the traffic police.</p>
<h3>Romantic Dispute; Mediator Injured</h3>
<p>Xu Ronghua, who is already of mature age, lives with her aunt Xu Wangshi at No. 5 Zhenyuanli, Hongqiao Lane, Nanshi. In her early years, she married a man named Fu Yabin, but divorced him due to Xu's promiscuity. Soon after, she met Qu Jinsheng and lived with him for several months. However, her aunt Xu Wangshi strongly disagreed, incurring Qu's anger. Yesterday late at night, he invited Chen Xingyuan, Shao Songlin, Xu Shuanggen, and others, armed with weapons, and coerced Xu's aunt to acknowledge the facts, which led to a quarrel. Neighbors Yu Bingxing (cotton cloth merchant) and Wang Akang (painter) came to mediate, but the conversation went awry, and a major conflict broke out. Wang Akang was injured in the head by Qu with a pistol butt. The situation escalated, and the police, having heard the noise, arrived and took them to the Penglai Police Station for interrogation.</p>

<h3>From Shanghai to Shangrao</h3>
<p>— Tang Weibin</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper, Shangrao, 20th] From Shanghai, the center of the Jiangzhe Plain, along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways, through the hilly areas of Hangzhou, Jinhua, Quzhou, and Guangfeng, and reaching the marshlands of Poyang Lake, this vast and fertile natural area spanning thousands of miles, has long been brought closer to Shanghai by the construction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The important hub of this new artery—Shangrao—once known for its military importance, is now rising to prominence as a key economic and transportation center, thus earning the nickname "Little Shanghai." The nickname "Little Shanghai" used to belong to Lanxi, but now it has been taken over by Shangrao, because the main artery between Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi used to be the Guangxin River and the Qu River, but now it belongs to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Therefore, Lanxi, where the Qu and Jiang rivers converge, had to give the nickname Little Shanghai to Shangrao. This main artery suffered more damage than any other route during the Anti-Japanese War, and it was repaired more quickly than any other route in the early days of restoration. The current security along the route is also safer than the routes in North China. Therefore, although it is in the early stages of hard work, it has already shown a vigorous and enterprising atmosphere. On this clear and refreshing autumn day, the author traveled from Shanghai to Hangzhou, then to Jinhua, and then to Shangrao in Jiangxi, and then from Shangrao to Hangzhou and back to Shanghai. I would like to briefly describe my impressions as follows:</p>
<h3>A Day's Stay in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Hangzhou is the most beautiful city in China, and it is a place where the author has traveled before. I have already visited all the scenic spots and historical sites. I am only staying for one day now, and I did not intend to go out for sightseeing again. However, the official business that should be handled in Hangzhou was completed smoothly in the first half of the day, and there was still a very generous amount of time in the afternoon. The author and four other people were walking along the edge of the lake, chatting. Originally, it was just for a walk, but I did not expect that we had unknowingly reached the entrance of the Foreign Guest House, so we entered and visited. The rooms inside were clean and tidy, and the gardens and flowers were sparse and elegant. The large living room happened to be the venue for the World Young Women's Christian Association. Today was a regular holiday, so we were able to enter the venue and visit. The walls were lined with photos of the activities of various national Young Women's Christian Association groups, which were dazzling and beautiful. In particular, a specially made wooden fish was placed on the platform. It is said that the fish is knocked at the beginning and end of meetings to replace the ringing of a bell, which is very unique.</p>
<p>After leaving the Foreign Guest House, we continued to walk and talk. We then walked to Zhaoqing Temple. Zhaoqing Temple was built by the King of Wuyue and was known as one of the four major jungles on the lake, along with Lingyin, Jingci, and Fenglin. From the outside, Lingyin seems more solemn and majestic, but from the inside, Zhaoqing is located in a flat area on the shore of the lake, so it is more open than Lingyin, which is built on the mountainside. The temple has an ordination platform, a Thousand Buddha Pavilion, a Sutra Depository, a Dingguan Pavilion, a Guanyin Well, a Kanshan Pavilion, and a Woniu Stone, as well as many precious stone carvings embedded in the walls, which add a lot of color to the ancient temple. In front of the temple gate is the Qinglian Pond (commonly known as the Release Pond), and there is the Wanshou Bridge on the pond. The ancient trees in front of the temple are lush, and the environment is elegant. The temple buildings were only partially damaged during the occupation. In the early days of the victory, the military borrowed them to stay in. Now that the military has been transferred, the remaining houses have been borrowed by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau for the use of a labor training center. Today was a regular holiday, so we were able to go to various places to see casually. The classrooms, dormitories, and dining halls, although the equipment was very simple, were all very tidy and clean, showing a vigorous and thriving atmosphere. It is said that those who are trained here are all junior cadres recruited from examinations. There are several classes for both vehicle affairs and machine affairs. The service staff on the train have also received strict training here. The author recalled the past when he traveled on the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway under the leadership of his friend Hou Jiayuan. The service staff on all trains were attentive and polite to the passengers. Now he can infer that the service staff on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will naturally have the same service spirit. The future development of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's business depends on the personnel trained in this batch.</p>
<h3>From Hangzhou to Jinhua</h3>
<p>The author arrived at Hangzhou City Station in the morning and took the special express train to Jinhua at 7:10 AM. He arrived on time at 1:39 PM. This section is only 185 kilometers long, which is slightly shorter than the Shanghai-Hangzhou section, but the travel time is 6 and a half hours. On the surface, it seems a bit slow, but in fact, the railway bureau has done its best, because this was originally a very difficult task. This section of the road is not like the plain of the Beijing-Shanghai Road, but a hilly area with larger slopes and curves, which is not up to the standard of a first-class line. During the Anti-Japanese War, the damage was quite serious. The section between Hangzhou and Zhuji was hastily repaired by the Japanese after the damage. The bridges between Zhuji and Jinhua were almost completely destroyed, and nine-tenths of the station buildings at each station were also destroyed. As for the tracks, power lines, machine rooms, and water supply stations, they were completely dismantled, and only the roadbed was roughly preserved. With such severe damage, it is naturally not easy to repair and open to traffic in a short time. As for the driving aspect, the roadbed between Hangzhou and Zhuji is not very solid. For the sake of safety, the driving speed cannot be too fast. The section between Zhuji and Jinhua is the original roadbed, so the express train is faster, which is not much different from the Shanghai-Hangzhou section. However, the bridges that have been re-repaired still need to run slowly, which is safer. The author took advantage of the opportunity that the train was slower in some places and stopped at large stations for a longer time to browse the scenery along the line and observe various situations.</p>
<p>When the train left Hangzhou City Station, it quickly passed Nanxingqiao Station and arrived at the riverside. It then slowly passed over the Qiantang River Bridge. The waves of the Qiantang River and the peaks of the mountains gave people a feeling of grandeur and joy. The Liuhe Pagoda stands on the riverside, and its nearby is the Zhijiang University campus. The tall buildings and pavilions are reflected in the river, and the reflection of the morning glow and waves are mapped out, making it even more beautiful. When the car passed over the bridge, I was reminded of my old friend Mao Yisheng, who designed and built this bridge at that time. His knowledge, technology, experience, and perseverance are indeed rare in today's engineering world, which made people have the same admiration for Mr. Zhan Youtian when they took the Ping-Sui Road train through Qinglong Bridge. When passing Xiaoshan Station, the train stopped for a little longer. The author got off the train and took a look at the station casually. Xiaoshan was originally a county with a high culture, abundant products, and a wealthy place. Although it had been through a robbery, the buildings between the county seat and the townships were still very tidy. Xiang Lake, which is only three kilometers away from the station, can be seen from the slightly higher ground at the station and on the train. The station has a river that can lead to the lake. The lake is about 20 kilometers in circumference, shaped like a gourd, and is surrounded by mountains. The peaks are majestic and the scenery is very beautiful. Unfortunately, the car kept moving forward, and the shape of the lake gradually disappeared. Zhuji is the hometown of the peerless beauty Xi Shi. There are many scenic spots and historical sites here. Luoluo Village, Xilongtan, Liangfeng Cave, etc. are too far from the station to be seen. Only the landscape of Wuxie Mountain can be vaguely seen. When the train passed Suxi, the water surrounded the mountains, the clear streams were turbulent, and the scenery was picturesque. From Yiwu to Jinhua, the buckwheat in the fields was a silver flower, and the waves were rolling in the wind. The fields and hillsides were full of jujube trees and crowberry trees. After the frost, the jujube trees lost half of their leaves, which made the branches more sparse and interesting. After the frost, most of the leaves of the crowberry trees turned red, and some of them were green and yellow. The jujube trees were white and granular, like pearls inlaid on the treetops. Under the sunlight, the bright red was set off by white, yellow, green, and other colors, which was even more beautiful. Because the author enjoyed the scenery along the line, he did not feel the slightest bit of fatigue, and at the same time, he did not feel that the train was running too slowly.</p>
<h3>Two Days' Tour in Jinhua</h3>
<p>The author and his party of two arrived in Jinhua at 1:39 PM on the afternoon of the first day, and left Jinhua on the direct train to Shangrao on the third day. In terms of time calculation, it was a full two days. The urban area of Jinhua and even Beishan have been visited. Jinhua had unprecedented prosperity during the Anti-Japanese War from 1940 to 1943. At that time, all the materials shipped from Shanghai to the inland were concentrated in Jinhua and then transferred to the free areas in the rear. Many people from the occupied areas in the southeast also passed through Jinhua to the inland. From only 50,000 to 60,000 people before the war, the population suddenly increased to more than 200,000. Naturally, like newly rich people, they did not know how to enjoy the sudden wealth. The military and political leaders of Zhejiang Province were also stationed in Jinhua at that time, which became the transportation, economic, military, and political center of various places in the southeast. This was the golden age in history, but soon the prosperity of Jinhua disappeared with the change of strategy. In the two years since the victory, thanks to the efforts of the local authorities, most of the destruction in Jinhua during the occupation has been repaired. The newly built municipal houses are very tidy and the streets are very clean, but the past prosperity is over. Although the train can reach Hangzhou and Shangrao, the sand beaches of Yiwu Port——Jinhua River are congested, and water transportation is not fully smooth. The transportation connecting the train and the sailboat is taken over by Lanxi. The economy and commerce have to decline day by day. At present, due to the depression of commerce, the population of the county seat is only more than 40,000, and the political expenses are stretched. The commissioner's office originally stationed in Jinhua was therefore abolished and merged into Quzhou County. The political leadership of the eastern Zhejiang region has also disappeared with it. However, Jinhua's culture has always been very high. From Xu Qian in the Southern Dynasty, Lü Zhiqian in the Song Dynasty, Song Lian in the early Ming Dynasty, to Li Qingzhao and Zheng Gangzhong in the Qing Dynasty, there are brilliant literary works left behind. At present, education is more developed. There are as many as seven secondary schools, including provincial, old metal eight county joint, county, and private schools. The site of National Yingshi University has also been determined to be located in Jinhua, coupled with the beautiful scenery of Beishan Spring, the strange rocks and caves, it is indeed a place for Zhong Yu to cultivate talents. The author spent a whole day to investigate Beishan and deeply felt that the natural wonders of the three caves of Beishan, if they can be equipped with artificial arrangement——building roads, building houses, to facilitate vehicle transportation and tourist rest, the benefits of absorbing tourism every year are enough to prosper everything; There are many caves in Beishan, and the three caves are the most famous; The so-called three caves are Zhaozhen (upper cave) Binghu (middle cave) Shuanglong (lower cave) three caves. Shuanglong Cave is a cave within a cave. Tourists have to lie in a small boat to enter the inner cave. The walls of the inner cave are full of stalactites and stalagmites, which resemble various forms; The Binghu Cave has a huge waterfall of ten zhang, suspended from the top, with rumbling thunder and flying beads, which is a wonderful sight. Zhaozhen Cave is spacious and deep, Qian Cave has Tianchi, a Line of Sky, and the branch cave has Longtan and other scenic spots. Jinhua has many scenic spots, and the detailed situation will be described in a separate article in the future.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Shangrao</h3>
<p>The author took the train at 1:40 PM from Jinhua and arrived in Shangrao on time at 11:00 PM. The situation seen along the way on the train will be described in detail when returning to Hangzhou from Rao. The author stayed in Rao for two nights and had a full day to investigate in Shangrao. Although it was a fleeting glance, there was still a considerable understanding of Shangrao's outline.</p>
<p>Shangrao County is located on the north side of the Xin River. It is the former Guangxin Prefecture government seat with a circumference of nine li. There are six city gates. The south gate and the west gate are the most prosperous. The main street outside the west gate is particularly flat. Part of the west gate city wall has been demolished and opened up as a commercial place. The moat is full of lotus flowers, and willows are lined up along the moat, the scenery is very nice. Shangrao County has 2,300 square kilometers, two towns and 28 villages, 370,000 people, 780,000 mu of fields, and produces rice, ramie, summer cloth, medicine, tea, oil, turmeric, etc. Xin River has three pontoon bridges connecting the south bank. The Xinren Academy is on the high platform on the south bank, with excellent scenery, and is now the site of Shangrao Middle School, which is a great place for string and song. More than 30 kilometers northwest of the city is Lingshan, with seventy-two peaks stretching for more than 100 li. From the northeast, there is an isolated stone standing in the air, named Shiren Peak. There is a Dragon Pond on the mountain, with many strange trees and precious grasses, and crystal is also produced. There are many scenic spots, but unfortunately, the road is a bit far, and I did not have time to visit. However, looking at the peaks and stacked green in the suburbs of the city, it is enough to admire the situation.</p>
<p>Shangrao is currently the center of material exchange between Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, which completely depends on the joint role of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the Xin River's water and land transportation. The Xin River is the second largest river in Jiangxi Province after the Gan River. The Xin River was originally called the Shangrao River, commonly known as the Xin River. Guangxin Prefecture was called Xinzhou from the Tang Dynasty to the Yuan Dynasty, and the name Xin River came from this. The Xin River starts from Yushan County and flows west to Hongruizhen, entering Poyang Lake with a length of 685 li. Although the Xin River originates from Huaiyu Mountain in Yushan County, the water only becomes deep when it flows to Shangrao County, about one zhang deep, which is the best place for boats to dock. It also converges with the river from Guangfeng County south of the county seat, and then joins the river from Qianshan County eighty li west to Hekouzhen, so it is called Hekou. From here to the west, it passes through Yiyang, Guixi, Yujiang, Yugan, and other counties and reaches Hongruizhen, where it enters Poyang Lake. The places passed by the Xin River are the rich places in Jiangxi Province. At present, the goods such as rice, tea, and tobacco leaves in these places are all collected in Shangrao and shipped to Hangzhou, Shanghai, and other places via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The salt, cloth, foreign goods, and other goods that are shipped into the Xin River Basin from Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places are also concentrated in Shangrao for distribution. Shangrao's current prosperity is pinned on this. In addition, Shangrao's customs are very simple and honest, and the people are very simple and honest. The most important rice, fish, meat, and vegetables in life are very cheap; the climate is also very normal, and it is a relatively wealthy and stable place in the inland. It is a pity that it is close to Guixi, and the general people are more superstitious.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Carriages</h3>
<p>The author originally planned to go to Nanchang from Shangrao, but the originally scheduled car had some temporary obstacles, so it was decided to return to Hangzhou directly from Shangrao. He took the express train at 7:05 AM and arrived on time at 10:50 PM. It took almost 16 hours on the train. With a mileage of 388 kilometers, the express train takes such a long time, which seems a bit too slow, but with the special difficulties in fact, this achievement is not easy. The situation of the section from Hangzhou to Jinhua has been briefly described above. Now, I will briefly describe the engineering and driving conditions of the section from Raojin.</p>
<p>The 120 kilometers from Quzhou County to Jinhua were repaired and opened to traffic successively during and after the war. The roadbed and bridges are relatively stable. Although Jinhua to Quzhou County is only 82 kilometers, there are five major bridges in this section, including Jinhua River, Lingyu Port, Xiashan Creek, Shangshan Creek, and Dongji River. The losses were severe, and the repair project was huge. The bridges were repaired in February of this year, working day and night. The bridge abutment project was completed one after another in more than three months, but all the required steel beams had to be ordered from the United Kingdom and the United States, which was difficult to meet the emergency. It was necessary to change the plan, and the Jinhua River was the first to build a wooden arch bridge, and the Lingshan Port Dongji River was the first to build a wooden truss bridge. The old I-beams and square wood were first erected and opened to traffic in the Shangshan Creek and Xiashan Creek. When the train passed these five bridges, in order to ensure safety, it had to move slowly. The author looked down from the car window at the reconstruction project of the bridge piers and the temporary erection of the construction bridge to open to traffic, and could not help but admire the ingenious design of the bridge workers, who came up with a solution in a situation where there was no way. For this reason, it is naturally inappropriate to blame the slightly slower driving speed.</p>
<p>At present, the locomotives, vehicles, and all important equipment required by the railway mostly rely on foreign countries, but it is not easy to import them. Therefore, no matter in terms of driving or engineering, the difficulties of equipment are felt everywhere. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway opened to traffic in sections in advance in this extremely difficult environment. Although the passenger car that the author took this time was a low hook, lacked steel plates, and could not help but vibrate, it was made by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Factory itself. In the current difficult situation of equipment, this is another difficult thing.</p>
<p>The power of the current train on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is not generated incidentally when the locomotive is in motion, but is generated by a diesel generator installed in another carriage. Every morning before dawn and after dusk, the train lights are as bright as day, which is convenient for passengers to read books and newspapers in the carriage. The author spent sixteen hours in the carriage this time. During the day, he enjoyed the scenery along the line, and after dusk, he read the Qingbao, so he did not feel that the time was too long.</p>
<p>The service staff on the train are very polite to the passengers, and the tea and water service is very attentive. The carriage is always cleaned very cleanly. The restaurant car attached to the train, although simple, is quite clean.</p>
<p>Based on the above points, the author admires the spirit of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway authorities in seeking progress from the difficult circumstances during the entire sixteen hours and predicts that there will be great improvements in the near future.</p>
<h3>False Military Officer Zhang Baozhi Re-Arrested for Fraud; Shanghai Girl You Xi Scammed Out of Two Gold Rings</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wuxi 22nd Dispatch] Zhang Binzhi, a Hunan Binqing native, 18 years old, residing in Yangximen Houjie, was previously a private in the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters. In September of this year, he impersonated a military officer, swaggered around Wuxi, and was apprehended by the North District military police, transferred to the command post, and detained for ten days before being released. However, Zhang did not repent and reform, but continued to stay in hotels, using his fraudulent techniques. Recently, he met a Miss Shen from Shanghai who was visiting Wuxi, and swindled her out of two gold rings before fleeing without a trace. On the 20th of this month, Zhang appeared at the railway station, wearing a military uniform and the plum blossom epaulettes of a major, carrying a document bearing the name of He Qi of the 17th Officer General Team of the Central Training Corps, and tried to forcibly buy a train ticket under the guise of a military officer, resulting in a quarrel with the ticket seller. He was immediately arrested by the station military police, who interrogated him. Zhang confessed to impersonating a military officer and defrauding people of property, and two original gold rings were found on him. He was handed over to the military police investigation office on the 22nd for interrogation and handling.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Bandits Are So Bold! They Rob, Then Sleep Soundly, Howling as They Leave</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Wu Jin 21st Dispatch] In Yi District of this county, in the tea mountain area near the city wall and in the You two townships, major robberies occurred continuously on the 15th and 16th. The bandits acted as a gang, numbering up to twenty or more, and were completely unrestrained. Late at night on the 15th, a large number of bandits arrived at Yangjia Village in the tea mountain township. They spoke in dialects, wore clothing of varying lengths, and carried long and short guns. They first set up sentry posts in the village, and then broke into the homes of villagers such as Yang Hongying and Wu Gouda, looting them one by one. Chickens, rice, ducks, and clothes were all taken away. The bandits came and went with ease, and the entire village suffered significant losses. In Zhang Bridge Village in You township, at about 10:00 PM on the 16th, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived, carrying long and short guns, and successively robbed the homes of Xue Huisheng and others one by one, tying up five or six nearby residents. After the robbery, they drank and made merry for about two hours in a small hotel, and then slept soundly there for about two hours. They were discovered by the villagers, who beat gongs and cried for help, and the bandits howled and fled. It has been learned that this township has always been peaceful. This time, the county government concentrated and reorganized the self-defense forces and transferred them to other locations, leaving the villagers without protection and suffering losses. The public is in uproar.</p>
<h3>Suzhou's Winter Relief Fund Generously Donated Up to 800 Million</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Suzhou 21st Dispatch] The preparatory work for the Suzhou winter relief campaign is actively underway. A relief committee was formed at noon on the 21st. The original fundraising target was 500 million yuan, but on that day, the committee members generously donated, totaling up to 800 million yuan. Another report: The Taizhou area Clearing and Suppression Command Post in this county has dispatched teams for several days. The joint office for winter defense in the four townships of Xihua, Changfeng, Shifan, and Dongzhu has been established and will launch a large-scale search and suppression operation within days.</p>
<h3>The Second Lesson of Democracy in Paradise</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 22nd Dispatch] The citizens of Hangzhou have already had one lesson in democracy, with the popularly elected city councilors. This National Assembly election should be the second lesson.</p>
<p>The National Assembly election in the Hangzhou area started with nomination contests, then moved on to central competition for candidates. In terms of area, Zhu Shaozhou was chosen but then gave up, and Li Chu Kuang, after returning as a substitute, suddenly leaped to being a directly elected candidate. This change happened only two days before the election. Furthermore, a female representative candidate, Jiang Meiying, was designated and handed over to the election office only half a day before the election. Such urgency naturally caused many places to be extraordinarily tense. In the party headquarters and election office, the people actually in charge were truly working on an empty stomach.</p>
<h3>Li Chu Kuang Publicly Advertises</h3>
<p>On the 21st, before dawn, the streets were still quiet, and various shops hung out the national flag. Candidate Li Chu Kuang plastered buses with slogans saying "Please Vote." Around the Lakeside area, every pillar had "Please Vote for Li Chu Kuang" on it. On various roads, large red paper posters also read "Please Vote for Li Chu Kuang." It is said that other candidates were working hard behind the scenes. Only Li Chu Kuang was publicly advertising and campaigning, but it seemed not lively enough with just Li Chu Kuang alone. Perhaps the other candidates were saving paper, so they didn't need to advertise. On the second day, candidate Zhu Chengde, whose qualifications were signed off by the party, also put up slogans on buses, saying "Promote Democracy, We Want Open and Free Elections."</p>
<h3>Large Trucks Carry Voters</h3>
<p>The most magnificent polling place was the one at the City Chamber of Commerce. Upon entering the gate, one immediately saw large gold characters on a large red silk banner saying "Please Unanimously Support Mr. Jin Runquan as a Representative to the National Assembly." Many businessmen were voting there, and they seemed very happy. The liveliest situation was at the union polling place, where groups of voters were being carried in by large trucks.</p>
<h3>Showing Movies to Attract Votes</h3>
<p>The polling place of the Education Association was upstairs in its building. The director of the polling place said, "We plan to show a movie on Saturday afternoon to welcome voters from the education community to watch, but they must vote beforehand." Many area polling places were also trying their best to get voters to vote. The scene seemed quieter and the order was indeed very good compared to the City Council election. There were no disputes.</p>
<h3>Candidate List Mixed Up</h3>
<p>The list of candidates revealed in many polling places had some errors. For example, candidate Chen Qiye (Qin Shi) from the industry and mining groups was listed as nominated by the central government, but Chen Qinshi was also listed as signed up. Also, in the technician category, there was one candidate nominated by the Youth Party, who was a civil engineer, but it was written that there were two nominated by the Youth Party, one named "Civil Engineering Department." In the women's polling place, several female leaders were talking at length around a long table. A polling place staff member said, "Some of them have voted and left, and some have voted and are resting."</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the Polling Place Slips</h3>
<p>One polling place was located in the Ziyong Police Squadron headquarters, but because the squadron headquarters had newly papered walls, the polling place slip was posted behind the wooden sign that said "Volunteer Police Squadron Headquarters." Some people couldn't find the polling place and asked the police where it was. The police said "It's here!" The polling place staff quickly came out and turned the wooden sign around, but after not long, it became the Volunteer Police Squadron Headquarters again.</p>
<p>During the election process, Mayor Zhou Xiangxian discovered a person casting four votes, and immediately severely punished them. Some people were asking others to vote for "XXX" for a meal, and some were running around asking for votes, saying that if they succeeded, they would definitely repay them.</p>
<h3>Qualifications of Two Party Members Waver</h3>
<p>In this paradise of Hangzhou, looking at this election, one can conclude with what the reporter heard from a person in charge of the Municipal Provisional Council in early May, which is: "Hangzhou is incomparable to Shanghai. Shanghai is lively, but Hangzhou is always calm and steady. This represents perseverance and simplicity." If we use this conclusion to explain this election in paradise, it can be said that it has made another step forward.</p>
<p>During the election, the Kuomintang party headquarters was particularly tense. They frequently instructed party members to give up their candidacy, otherwise they would be expelled from the party and have their qualifications revoked. As of the time this reporter was writing, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters had already requested the Central Committee to expel two people from the party.</p>
<p>In short, this election was of course done while learning, so everything was relatively unfamiliar, but amidst the unfamiliarity, a little bit of enthusiastic emotion could still be seen. (Special Correspondent Chu Sheng)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Compatriots Suggest Renaming Roads, Removing Chinese Street</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hong Kong 21st Dispatch] The Hong Kong and Kowloon Residents Association recently made a suggestion to the Hong Kong government to add street names to house numbers. This is an epoch-making reform. The Hong Kong government has adopted it and started implementing it. In the future, people from mainland China will find friends much more easily than before. The Residents Association, with the reason of "enhancing Sino-British friendship," also plans to suggest to the Hong Kong government to rename some roads in Hong Kong and Kowloon after famous Chinese people. This suggestion does not seem easy to implement, at least not at this stage. Streets in Hong Kong and Kowloon are named after provinces of China, and some are named after major cities of China, but none are named after famous Chinese people. However, except for one "Shanghai Street," streets named after Chinese provinces and cities are either in remote corners or are short and narrow, far behind the so-called "Queen's Road," "Des Voeux Road," "Nathan Road," and "Prince Edward Road"! In the bustling Central district of Hong Kong, there is a "Chinese Street," called Chinese St. in English, which translates to "Chinatown." This street is the narrowest (cars cannot drive on it), dirtiest (there is a ditch in the middle), and oldest street among the streets for sale in Central. But for some reason, the Hong Kong government's "official translation" calls it "Chinese Street." Compatriots in Hong Kong unanimously say that this street should not be given this name and should be removed. (Special Correspondent Yu Jian)</p>
<h3>Yongchuan and Neijiang Sections of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to Start Construction Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Chongqing 20th Dispatch] The bidding for the earthwork engineering of the Yongchuan and Neijiang sections of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was held a few days ago, and construction will start soon. French engineer M. Feyaux told our reporter: "The engineering progress of this road is extremely fast. If the Sino-French agreement is successfully signed and French equipment is continuously supplied, the Chongqing-Neijiang section can be built quickly." However, it is not known when the signing procedure can be completed, and the Sino-French authorities are likely not as well-informed, and there has been no news of the Shaban Bank Group coming to China for a third time.</p>

<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Representatives of the grain industry who requested exemption from the grain tax have previously gone to Beijing to petition, but have not yet received a concrete response from the central government.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Yuan Xiaoyuan (Ya Yong), a key figure in underground work during the Anti-Japanese War, came to Yi for the public funeral of Bao Yanmin. On the 11th, all sectors held a grand welcome at the county government. Zhu Ping gave a speech and suggested that Ai Qingyuan be an honorary citizen of Jiangyin. Another report: A delegation of the provincial land and grain office, including Liang Dayou and others, went to Qingcheng on the 11th to track down arrears in land tax collection and collect new taxes in this county.

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] In order to maintain local security, the local security authorities declared an emergency curfew from the 19th. The situation has been quite good since its implementation. It will be lifted at 6:00 AM on the 22nd, but ordinary nighttime inspections will continue.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Dispatch] A bloody case occurred in Panjiaqiao, Wang Township, in this county on the 18th. After the incident, the situation was fully reported in this newspaper. It has now been learned that the deceased was named Zhao Heming, a native of Shanghai, 33 years old, residing at No. 39 Shangxian Fang, Linsen Road, Shanghai. He was the manager of the Mei Clothing Company at No. 520 Linsen Middle Road. He had three wives and concubines. On the 19th, the local court dispatched a coroner to the scene of the incident for inspection and found five axe wounds on the neck.

<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau Explains Increase in Use of Civilian Land</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 22nd Dispatch] Regarding the case where all sectors of Zhuji accused the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Engineering Office of colluding with city monks to seize civilian land, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau now explains as follows: The railway is actively carrying out double-track engineering, and many stations have facilities that need to be improved. Previously, because transportation at Zhuji Station was frequent, the original freight line in the station was too short, and the storage area for goods was also insufficient. Therefore, it was approved by the Bureau Affairs Council to extend the original freight line to Qinglonggeng, and the Hangzhou-Ji Engineering Section was ordered to survey and report on the matter before legally carrying out the requisition. The statement that it was at the request of a certain merchant is a misunderstanding. Moreover, the county government of Zhu had been informed that the increase in land use required for the project to extend the freight line and other projects should convene the owners to discuss the matter through the town government of the inner city, and this matter is currently being requested from the county government of Zhu to quickly stipulate the land price in accordance with the law, so as to complete the requisition procedure as soon as possible.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Wujin 22nd Dispatch] Xu Min, a bandit district chief on the wanted list, a native of Bashiqiao, Danyang, 27 years old, tall and fierce-looking, is a demon who kills without blinking an eye. He usually roams the border between Wu and Dan, demolishing houses and collecting grain, and has successively killed more than a hundred villagers. At about 4:00 PM on the 20th, he and Chen Guoqing and Xu Qiaode sneaked into Longshitain Village near Anjiashe. The district office learned of this, and the special assault team of the self-defense force, led by Huang Zhenhua and others, rushed to encircle and suppress them. The bandits were alerted and rushed out of the house, firing guns to escape. Seeing this, all the team members bravely chased and pursued them, crossing several rivers. Bandit Xu finally succumbed because he was shot in the shoulder and because his cotton clothes were wet from going into the river, so he was arrested. He was escorted to the city on the 21st. After interrogation, he was transferred to the Zhenjiang Chang Danyang Clearing and Suppression Command Headquarters for legal action in the afternoon. The county government also ordered the Second Section to issue 30 million national currency to reward the self-defense force members of the district.</p>
<h3>Songjiang and Fengxian Vote Enthusiastically</h3>

<h3>Two Cases Occurred, Cai Suizhi Detained for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Kunshan 22nd Dispatch] Cai Suizhi, a senator of Xiema Bridge, was found to be free of toxic substances after being accused of smoking opium and being inspected in the city. He has been detained by the county government, and Cai is also greatly related to the case of forcing the villager Wu Shigen to death. It is said that Wu was extorted of a farming cow, and after the local villagers found the thief, they escorted him to the security team headquarters. Cai saw an opportunity and immediately plotted, instructing the Baozhang Shen Jingyuan and others to extort food rice and cash from Wu. Later, Chen, the deputy of the village self-defense team, heard about this and tried to share the spoils, bringing a bag to Wu to demand rice. Wu refused to pay, and Chen reported the situation to Cai. Cai was furious and declared that he wanted to accuse Wu Shigen of being a Communist suspect, and threw back the previously received rice money. At this point, Wu was filled with worry and hanged himself to death. This case is currently being thoroughly investigated before being reviewed and handled.</p>

He first pointed out that modern democratic politics should be based on three points: National independence, Popularization of civil rights, and Prosperity of people's livelihood. Mr. Ou mentioned the lack of education and too many illiterate people in China, saying that educators should take the greatest responsibility. Today, the UNESCO promotes basic education and lists China as one of the five dark areas (Dark Zoke), which requires us to deeply reflect on the current situation in China. 1.5 million teachers are needed to complete the national literacy education. There are fewer than 100,000 currently certified national teachers, so we should urgently launch a micro-teacher movement, promote basic education, and establish citizen education and the foundation for popular civil rights.</p>

<h3>A Child Education Problem: How to Stop Children from Crying</h3>
<p>— Chen Heqin</p>
<p>Today's topic is "How to Stop Children from Crying."</p>
<p>Children are different from adults. When children are happy, they laugh innocently, and when things don't go their way, they cry loudly. However, crying too much is annoying to adults and detrimental to the children themselves. Now, we want to explore why children cry so often and what methods we can use to stop them from crying.</p>
<p>Philosophers have two views on children's crying. One view is that children's crying is beautiful and even like heavenly music. Another view is that children's crying is a protest, a cry against this wicked world; Rousseau once said so. Let's put these aside. From a physiological perspective, crying is a natural phenomenon for children. For example, when a child is in the womb, the lungs are flat and not yet functioning for breathing. Once born, the child must cry to expand the lungs. Therefore, at this time, a child's crying is a critical factor in determining survival.</p>
<p>After this, children still have a close relationship with crying, because if they don't cry, their lives are still in danger. But the question is, why do children need to cry? What causes them to cry? Based on my experience, I believe that children cry for seven physiological reasons:</p>
<p>The first reason is "hunger." Children will cry when they are hungry; if they don't cry, they cannot survive. Crying is their only weapon. To stop children from crying, we must feed them on time.</p>
<p>The second reason is "pain." Children will also cry if they bump their bodies or are hurt by something else. Regarding this point, parents should pay more attention and protect and inspect them at all times.</p>
<p>The two reasons mentioned above are generally known. I won't go into detail. The following five reasons may not be known to everyone, so I will specifically raise them for your reference.</p>
<p>The third reason is "thirst." I once saw a four-year-old child who was so thin that he was almost unrecognizable and cried all day long. I often found it strange, so I asked his mother and observed his life. Oh! It turned out that this child had never drunk boiled water since birth. We must know that children, like adults, also need to drink water. Although breast milk contains water, it is very little. Therefore, we should give them boiled water every two feedings, and morning and evening are also essential. Crying because of thirst and not getting water is also common.</p>
<p>The fourth reason is "cold." Children will also cry when they are cold. Parents should pay attention at all times and add clothes for them as needed.</p>
<p>The fifth reason is "heat." Children will also cry when they are hot. However, this "experience" comes from my own child. Once, we moved, and I held my child in the car. Because it was summer and the sun was strong, I used an umbrella to shield him. However, he kept crying all the way. I wondered, he didn't cry when he rode in the car before, what was the reason? But as soon as we got home, he stopped crying. It turned out that children are also afraid of heat and strong sunlight. Later, I tested it several times, and it proved the reason for this crying.</p>

<h3>Departing Army Loses Footing, Malaysia Defeated by China United: 4-2 Performance Tense and Exciting, Charity Match with Huge Crowds</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Malayan Chinese United Football Team, on the eve of their departure, played a farewell match at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM yesterday against the China United Team, which was a combination of Donghua Qing and Bai teams from this city. Fans, impressed by the skills of the Malaysian Chinese team, flocked to the event as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The honorary seats, special seats, and regular seats were all sold out, with crowds of people packed tightly, estimated to be around 20,000. When a goal was scored, the sound of firecrackers resounded through the sky, marking a rare spectacle this season. The orphanage band played music to add to the excitement, and the Fourth Dimension Army, along with military police, maintained order, which was generally good.</p>
<h3>A Miniature of the National Games Final</h3>
<p>After a dramatic 90-minute battle, the China United Team defeated the Malaysian Chinese team with a score of 4-2, thanks to their strategic victory. In the first half, China United scored three goals, achieving an unexpected major victory. The match was tense and exciting beyond description, crisp and fast-paced, with no moment of pause. The strength of both teams was evenly matched, making it a miniature of the Shanghai-Singapore National Games final.</p>
<h3>The Fatal Wounds of the Malaysian Chinese Team</h3>
<p>The victory of the China United Team came as a surprise to many fans. In fact, the performance was particularly exciting, with the defense being much stronger than that of the Malaysian Chinese team, thwarting the Malaysian Chinese team's offense. Zhang Lingen's dead-on marking of Xie Wenliang and Mei Runhua's injury and departure were fatal wounds for the Malaysian Chinese team. The team's short stature was also a drawback. The forwards and defenders were all trapped in a situation where they could not connect. The counterattack in the second half was too late. Bad luck was also a factor. Li Yiyin missed a penalty kick, and Xia Tixian's sure shot hit the crossbar, as if it were fate. On the other hand, the defense of the China United team was excellent, and the forwards Han Longhai and Li Yao were particularly ingenious. The outcome hinged on this.</p>
<h3>The China United Team Filled with Vigor</h3>
<p>The match started at 3:15 PM, with He Chunjun as the referee and Chen Jixiang and Wu Shouheng as linesmen. The China United team launched frequent attacks, threatening the Malayan Chinese team. In the second minute, Mei Runhua of the Chinese United team was injured and replaced by Lin Yinyin. At 10 minutes, Zhang Guoxing, eager to save the situation, committed a handball in the penalty area and was penalized with a penalty kick. Captain Sun took the shot and scored, giving the Shanghai team the lead. Firecrackers went off and cheers erupted. Four minutes later, Longhai advanced through the middle and launched a surprise attack, catching Zhu Zhicheng off guard and sending the ball into the net. The China United team scored two goals in a row, filled with vigor. The five forwards of the Chinese United team counterattacked, but the Shanghai team's defense was tight, making it difficult to break through. At 40 minutes, Qu Yongfu violently collided with Xia Tixian in the penalty area, and Li Yiyao of the Chinese United team took the penalty kick, but missed the goal. The China United team narrowly escaped, and good fortune came again. At 44 minutes, Li Yao received a pass from Yongfu and shot from 30 yards out, hitting the net perfectly. At the end of the first half, the China United team led 3-0.</p>
<h3>4-2 Final Victory</h3>
<p>At the start of the second half, the visiting team adjusted Liu Fengchang to the right wing and Xia Tixian to his original position as center forward, unleashing their power and launching a fierce attack. At seven minutes, Xia Tixian dribbled the ball back and passed it to the forward. Hu Wenxiang shot from 35 yards out, high and fast. Bang Lun jumped to save, but the angle was slightly off, and the ball went in. 3-1, the Chinese United team pulled back a goal, and their morale soared. The China United team's hinterland was ravaged. Youliang was substituted, and Mingzhe came on the field. Both sides attacked and defended each other, but it was difficult to score. Until the 35th minute, Hu Wenxiang made a solo run and shot close to the goal, which Bang Lun failed to defend. The ball went into the net again, 3-2, one goal behind. Wu Qixiang left the field due to a foot injury and returned after about two minutes. With seven minutes left until the end of the match, Chen Mingzhe launched an attack from the periphery, breaking through three defenses. Chen Jiawan failed in his duty, and his nephew established merit. 4-2, the Chinese United team secured their final victory. Soon after, Jin Ming announced the end, and the China United team defeated the Malayan Chinese United team 4-2, avenging their defeat in Kuala Lumpur. The lineups of both sides were as follows:</p>
<p>China United: Zhang Banglun, Li Yichen, Wu Qixiang, Han Renbo, Qu Yongfu, Zhang Linji</p>
<p>Malayan Chinese United: Zhu Zhicheng, Chen Jiawan, Zhang Guoxing, Yang Jiasong, Li Yiyao, Wu Jincheng, Guan Shunde, Xie Wenliang, Mei Runhua, Xia Tixian, Hu Wenxiang, Liu Fengchang</p>

<h3>Self-Supplied Foreign Exchange Import Commodity Procurement Review Committee Established Today; First Meeting Convened by National Bank President Zhang</h3>
<p>The Preparations for the Self-Supplied Foreign Exchange Import Commodity Procurement Review Committee have been generally completed, and the committee is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Bank of China Conference Room on the Bund at 1:00 PM this afternoon. The meeting will be convened by Zhang Jia, President of the Bank of China and concurrently Chairman of the China Trust Bureau. In addition to the Bank of China and the China Trust Bureau, representatives from the Import and Export Management Committee, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Customs, and the Audit Department will also participate. The main topics for discussion will be to determine detailed procurement rules and discuss procurement prices. Importers are extremely concerned about the establishment of this committee.</p>
<h3>Chinese Steel Rolling Mill Sends Letter to Import and Export Management Committee Requesting Direct Allocation of Import Quotas</h3>
<p>In February of this year, taking advantage of the fact that steel rolling mills in Shanghai had not yet organized a trade association, a foreign-owned China Aluminum Rolling Mill instructed its senior Chinese staff to separately notify Yuanchang, Youlian, Lianggong, Asia, Shanghai, Gongyong, Guang, Shengye, and Xiang, and other Chinese-owned factories, to send letters to the quota allocation office of the Import and Export Management Committee requesting an increase in the China Aluminum Mill's foreign exchange quota, so that the factories could purchase more aluminum sheets from China Aluminum. The factories believed this to be true and separately sent letters to the quota allocation office requesting that the matter be handled in accordance with the instructions of China Aluminum. As a result, China Aluminum was allocated foreign exchange, accounting for 63% of the total aluminum quota, totaling over 1,600 tons of aluminum ingots for the first, second, and third quarters, with over 500 tons of aluminum ingots from the first quarter already arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<p>However, according to investigations, the amount of aluminum sheets that China Aluminum resold to various Chinese steel rolling mills from March to November of this year, excluding the two factories close to it, Qinchang and Huichang, was only 27 tons. Therefore, the factories that had written letters requesting an increase in China Aluminum's quota are greatly angered. In addition to organizing a trade association and requesting the quota allocation office to allocate quotas directly to each factory, they have also requested an investigation into the quantity of aluminum sheets sold by the China Aluminum factory to various Chinese factories from March to November, requesting an increase in the fourth-quarter quota for each Chinese factory and direct allocation. The Aluminum Industry Association has now forwarded all the opinions of its member factories to the Import and Export Management Committee for processing.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Cigarette Tax Regulations Still Under Close Study</h3>
<p>Cigarette factories in this city believe that the cost of cigarette production is increasing daily, and what is even more concerning is that sales have not been able to expand significantly. Due to transportation obstacles in various regions and rising cigarette prices, the purchasing power of consumers with limited income is affected. Therefore, adjusting the cigarette tax is a burden that they find difficult to bear.</p>
<p>The other day, Section Chief Wang of the Goods Tax Department convened representatives from the cigarette industry in this city at the Goods Tax Bureau to jointly study a suitable method for adjusting the tax rate. It is understood that the cigarette industry believes that repeated adjustments to the tax rate increase the cost for the factories. However, the government's tax revenue must also be considered. Therefore, they have suggested to the authorities that in addition to a reasonable adjustment of the cigarette tax rate, other suitable methods should be studied to increase the government's tax revenue without stimulating cigarette prices and affecting sales. The method of increasing tax revenue is currently under discussion, and it may involve initiating a general increase in cigarette production.</p>
<h3>American Tobacco from Taiwan Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>American-grown tobacco leaves from Taiwan Province, known for their excellent quality, were previously requested by tobacco merchants in this city to be shipped to Shanghai by the Taiwanese authorities for use in domestically produced cigarettes. However, the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau stated that the production of tobacco in Taiwan Province was not abundant and was only sufficient for its own needs. Any surplus would be shipped to other provinces. However, since the Monopoly Bureau shipped 300,000 pounds of American-grown Taiwanese tobacco to Shanghai last month and sold it directly to the foreign-owned British-American Tobacco Company, the mystery of Taiwanese tobacco leaves being only sufficient for its own needs has been broken. Furthermore, recently there have been discoveries of Taiwanese tobacco leaves on the market, said to have been smuggled from Taiwan, which are about 30-40% cheaper than domestically produced tobacco leaves of the same quality.</p>
<p>Cigarette Prices Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cigarette market situation was such that due to continuous shipments from various factories and tight cash positions among merchants, buying interest was weak, and speculators dumped their holdings, causing prices to decline. However, as prices fell, some people bought in, and the market slightly rebounded. As a result, a pack of ten British-American Tobacco cigarettes fell by 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 24.2 million yuan, and Old Knife cigarettes also fell by 350,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, except for a slight increase in packs of twenty Nanyang and fifty Small Three Cannon cigarettes, the prices of other cigarettes fell by 1,000 to 3,000 yuan per carton. The Bank Brand Nanyang Company distributed its products, resulting in heavy selling and a huge decline of 7,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Also reported: It is heard that after the market closed, the trend for Old Knife cigarettes in the off-market improved, and prices increased by 1.8 to 1.9 million yuan, with people buying in.</p>
<h3>Japanese Reparation Materials to Arrive in Shanghai by Mid-December</h3>
<p>Japanese reparation materials to our country have now been notified by the Executive Yuan to the shipping industry, preparing to send ships to Yokosuka, Japan, to load and return to China, and a supervision meeting will be held at the Shanghai China Merchants Bureau on December 1st. Representatives from the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the Resources Committee will attend to discuss the first batch of materials. "The 19th of Japan."</p>
<h3>Rayon Distribution to Resume Soon; Full Distribution of Three Suspended Periods; Finished Products Sell Well in India and Other Places</h3>
<p>Regarding the rayon distribution issue, according to those in charge of the Silk Weaving Industry Association, the Social Affairs Bureau's investigation is expected to be completed soon, and distribution is expected to resume around the 27th of this month. The China Trust Bureau has suspended distribution for three periods, so all of it will be distributed during this distribution.</p>
<p>Recently, 2,000 cases of rayon have been shipped from Japan. The total amount of each distribution is over 200 cases, so the concentrated distribution for three periods will only total over 600 cases. There is still a lot remaining, so rayon prices are not expected to fluctuate any further in the near future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our country's rayon finished products are currently selling extremely well in the Middle East, Persia, India, and other places, and are very popular among the local people. Recently, the Silk Fabric Joint Venture Company has shipped several hundred more bolts of silk fabrics to various regions. "Twenty ounces of factories," 451 pieces of machinery and equipment, departed from Yokosuka Port, Japan.</p>
<p>It is understood that during this discussion, details were made on the transportation of goods and the establishment of a receiving agency in Shanghai by representatives of various ministries, so that the machinery and tools could be distributed immediately after being loaded in Shanghai, without too long a delay. A detailed discussion was also held on the work of the Shanghai Wharf Warehouse. Chen Shijin, the representative of the supervision committee, is scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Japan by plane on the 26th. All exit procedures have been approved by MacArthur Headquarters and relayed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, the arrival date of the first batch of materials is not expected to be delayed, and it should arrive in Shanghai by mid-December.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Weaving Industry Recovers; Cotton Yarn Supply Insufficient</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong Airlines News] Hong Kong's weaving industry has recovered, and the supply of cotton yarn is extremely insufficient. "Official sources," "Come due to increased orders from abroad, Hong Kong's weaving industry has washed away the stagnant state of the past few months, and the need for cotton yarn has increased.</p>
<p>Qiu Bohui, Director of the Hong Kong Industry and Commerce Supply Office, is traveling to Dongche to discuss the issue of increasing the supply of Japanese yarn. According to the current situation, the quantity required monthly by Hong Kong is not sufficient to meet demand. The 10-count yarn required for the manufacture of cotton cloth by the Hong Kong weaving industry is very scarce on the market. As for the rumors that 3,000 bales of Shanghai yarn have arrived in Hong Kong, relevant parties say that a decision will be made in five days, and the claim that it has already arrived in Hong Kong is inaccurate.</p>

The date is Thursday, the 27th, at 5:30 PM, at the association's clubhouse lounge. All are welcome to attend. Admission tickets can be obtained from the association's inquiry office.</p>

<h3>Japanese Paper Ring 40,000 Rolls; China Trust Bureau Scheduled to Distribute; Distribution Price 500,000 Yuan Per Roll, Lower Than Market Price</h3>
<p>The China Trust Bureau previously obtained 85,000 rolls of "Fujikawa" brand Japanese paper rings from Japan, which were distributed to the cigarette factories in this city for application in the past two months. The second batch of 50,000 rolls is now being entrusted by the China Trust Bureau to the China Tobacco Company for distribution.</p>
<p>It is understood that of this period's 50,000 rolls, the cigarette factories in this city, large and small, received 40,000 rolls, and the cigarette factories in other cities received 10,000 rolls. The price of these paper rings has been approved by the China Trust Bureau, calculated at 500,000 yuan per roll, which is much cheaper than other paper rings on the market. The company is currently rushing to complete the procedures and expects to begin processing on the 26th of this month. The payment date is from the 26th to the 30th. After receiving the notice, each cigarette factory can pay at the China Trust Bureau according to the stipulated date and exchange the payment receipt for the purchase application form, then go to the Goods Tax Bureau to transfer the purchase three-part form and then to the China Company to transfer the warehouse slip and take the goods out themselves.</p>
<p>Although the quality of Japanese paper rings is relatively poor, at a time when paper rings are scarce, the supply to various factories is somewhat helpful. It is heard that the China Trust Bureau still has a considerable number of paper rings stored in customs warehouses. It is hoped that each factory will not abandon this period's distribution to avoid losing the right to the next period.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>One Hundred Lines on Du Fu's Poetic History (with Commentary)</h3>
<p>— Ding Shan</p>
<p>In poetry, he vows to emulate Qi and Ji,</p>
<p>In old age, he serves as a staff officer;</p>
<p>For thirty years, his brilliant verses filled the land,</p>
<p>Like a master gardener trimming a coral tree;</p>
<p>Dragon Gate's shaded ravines, layer upon layer,</p>
<p>The spring breeze of Liangyuan stirs mist and haze;</p>
<p>Among the elders, he befriended the two Lis,</p>
<p>Returning to Penglai, he composed three Rhapsodies.</p>
<p>(Note) Du Fu often compared himself to Qi and Ji, which some considered excessive. However, considering that he stands tall as the sage of a thousand years of poetry, comparing himself to Qi and Ji is a humble expression. The Duke left the Gorge in 766 AD and drifted to Jingchu; he died in 770 AD. There is a poem that says, "A guest in Hunan, moved by the spring, swallows still return to seek their master," hence this passage is written in mourning for him. The Duke's poems began in the Kaiyuan Tianbao era and ended in the fifth year of Dali, spanning about twenty-nine years. He wrote 1,141 poems, excluding the falsely attributed poems "To the Day of the Winter Solstice, Poem 2," "Watching the River Rise at the Bazhou Pavilion, Poem 2," and "Escape from Difficulties," totaling three poems. Four poems found in other collections, "Lamenting Vice Minister Changsun," "Wailing the Lady of Guo," "Drunken Words in the Army," and "Cuckoo Song," are also excluded, leaving a total of 1,134 poems. He attended banquets with Li Bai at the Lixia Pavilion, accompanied by Li Bei Hai, both of whom were older than Du Fu. In the tenth year of Tianbao, the Duke first arrived in the capital and presented three great ceremonial rhapsodies. Historical records all state that this was in the thirteenth year. According to the Imperial Records, the Three Great Rites were performed after ten victories. Du's memorial also says, "I grew up in Your Majesty's simple customs and have lived for forty years. Therefore, I know it must have been in that year."</p>
<p>Phoenix carriage, feathers woven into emerald green,</p>
<p>Officials and ministers, their faces moved in admiration;</p>
<p>Immortal officials displeased with the emperor by his side,</p>
<p>He was sent as a Commandant to Hexi, then as a staff officer;</p>
<p>Back and forth, a guest of Baishui and Fuzhou,</p>
<p>Gazing at the majestic Mount Yun, facing the main road;</p>
<p>The sound of the Yuyang drums unheard,</p>
<p>In tattered clothes, he hurried to the emperor's location.</p>
<p>(Note) The Duke was summoned to Chang'an to take the literary examination, and was placed in the selection order, but was unable to obtain an official position due to offending Li Linfu. The Tang Zhi Lin calls Li Linfu an immortal official. In the fourteenth year of Tianbao, he was offered the position of Commandant of Hexi, which he declined, and was instead appointed as a staff officer in the Right Guards. Because his family was in Fengxian, he went to Fengxian in November. He headed north and wrote a letter but before the letter arrived, the Duke had already escaped from the capital region. In the fifteenth year of Tianbao, in July, Emperor Suzong ascended the throne in Lingwu and changed the era name to Zhide. The Duke went from Baishui to Fuzhou, and in the autumn fled from Fuzhou to the emperor's location.</p>
<p>How many pipes and strings at the Jade Green Pond,</p>
<p>The persimmons of Guangwen were cooked and eaten;</p>
<p>Escaping from the rebels like a solitary dragon,</p>
<p>In hemp shoes, with bloody feet, he fled to Lingwu;</p>
<p>As a humble official, he recommended himself for the position of Reminder,</p>
<p>The three judicial departments did not recommend him, angering the Emperor;</p>
<p>He halted his horse at the Meridian Gate, leaving the capital,</p>
<p>From then on, tall buildings were delayed in the vast wilderness.</p>
<p>(Note) When the Duke went north and was trapped in the rebel's lair, Wang Wei and Zheng Qian were both disgraced, but the Duke alone escaped and went to Fengxiang to meet the Emperor, and was appointed Left Reminder. Because the Duke spoke in defense of Fang Guan, the Emperor was angered and ordered the three judicial departments to interrogate him; Prime Minister Zhang Hao saved him from being punished, and he was allowed to return to Fuzhou. In June of the first year of Qianyuan, because of Fang Guan's affair, he was appointed as the Sima of Huazhou. In the spring of the second year, Guanzhong was in chaos, and he abandoned his official position and went west, crossing the Long Mountains, and becoming a guest in Qinzhou. From then on, he traveled the difficult paths of Qin and Shu, and was forced to go to Jingchu, never returning to the capital.</p>
<p>The livelihood in Qinzhou was full of sorrow,</p>
<p>Driven by hunger, he traveled to Guanzhong;</p>
<p>Going west into Shu endlessly,</p>
<p>The sky in Shu is often gloomy, the nights long and rainy;</p>
<p>He chose a site for his thatched cottage in the western branch village,</p>
<p>All because he had no money, regretting saving on axes.</p>
<p>(Note) In the second year of Qianyuan, the Duke was a guest in Qinzhou, and wrote the Twenty Miscellaneous Poems, and the Three Officials and Three Separations all on the way. This was the initial stage of Du Fu's poetry transcending the ordinary and entering the realm of the sacred. The Duke's construction of his thatched cottage did not begin in Chengdu. He initially sought land in Qinzhou, in the western branch village west of Chigu, loving its proximity to the Zanshang monk's cloud room, but ultimately failed due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>West of the Huanhua Stream,</p>
<p>A thatched hut, a place to dwell in this vast world,</p>
<p>Suddenly, this house appears before his eyes,</p>
<p>Two hundred-year-old nanmu pillars;</p>
<p>An old wife and children about to arrive,</p>
<p>He builds this thatched hut, enough for one acre;</p>
<p>He buys bamboo to the south and plants trees to the north,</p>
<p>The oranges of He Qiong, the fruits of Xu Qing;</p>
<p>Five peach trees, four pine trees,</p>
<p>In the third month, the hall is completed, with flowers and trees arranged.</p>
<p>Flying birds bring their young to roost,</p>
<p>He buys a boat to take his wife for a leisurely cruise on the nearby shore;</p>
<p>Chess is played, needlework is made, life is simple,</p>
<p>When guests arrive, he often worries about having no wine or dried meat.</p>
<p>(Note) The Duke's nanmu tree was uprooted by the wind. He said, "The old folks say it is two hundred years old, and I have built my thatched hut entirely for this." Du's thatched cottage completion included poems about seeking mian bamboo from Prefect Wei Ming, begging for peach trees from Prefect Xiao Ming, seeking dead wood from Shao Fu Zi He, and seeking fruit trees from Xu Qing. Also, the poem "Returning to the Thatched Cottage" has "The old stone is askew on the small path to the thatched cottage, and the five peach trees also cover it." The four pine poems, "When the four pines were first transplanted, they were mostly three feet tall. It has been three years since I left, and they stand as tall as people." All are the Duke's personal management. Also, the poem "Flying birds bring their young to nest, and chattering swallows often come to their new nest" indicates that the thatched cottage was completed in the third month of the first year of Qianyuan. The Duke welcomes his wife and children without a poem title, but "The old wife draws a chessboard on paper, and the young children knock needles to make fishing hooks" and "The old wife takes a small boat, leisurely watching the young children bathing in the sunny river," the joy of family life is often seen in his poems.</p>
<p>He has been working hard for three years,</p>
<p>During which he still suffers insults while seeking food,</p>
<p>Du is an old guest of the dukes,</p>
<p>Unable to fly, he thinks of Lian Po;</p>
<p>Wind and rain encroach year after year,</p>
<p>The medicine railing collapses, the thatched eaves fall;</p>
<p>Dark, drizzling rain from summer to autumn,</p>
<p>He wants to move his boat to anchor in Jingchu.</p>
<p>(Note) The Duke's poem "Management began in Shangyuan, and the abacus is used to calculate the years." He lived in the thatched cottage for only three years. During this time, he often went to Xinjin and Qingcheng, and occasionally went to Hanzhou to seek food. His poem to Gao Shi, "Unable to fly, what about old friends," is full of resentment. The Duke's water railing poem "The thatched eaves ride giant waves, how can they not droop" also says, "The hall suffers from sand collapse and damage to the medicine railing" all because he often left the thatched cottage to avoid the chaos, and so it came to this. In the first year of Daizong Shiying, the Duke lived in Chengdu. In July, he sent Yan Wu back to court. Before long, Xu Zhidao, the military commissioner of Xichuan, rebelled. He then entered Zizhou and returned to Chengdu in winter, welcoming his family to Zizhou and staying with Zhang Yi. In December, he went to Shehong, intending to leave Shu, and wrote a poem to Commander Zhang before going to Wu Chu.</p>
<p>Zheng Gong came from the west, son of an old friend,</p>
<p>He hesitated slightly, condescending to serve as a subordinate;</p>
<p>In green robes and on white horses, he says it is a matter of public duty,</p>
<p>At fifty years old, what is the point of wearing red?</p>
<p>Lilacs tangled wildly at the river's edge,</p>
<p>Chickens pity each other, damaging their feathers;</p>
<p>Is it true that one has hung up their official hat,</p>
<p>Pride offends customs, inevitably bringing disaster;</p>
<p>Xie An elegantly enjoyed climbing and gazing,</p>
<p>Ruan Ji knew nothing of tolerance;</p>
<p>A fishing rod is only suitable for living on a boat,</p>
<p>A lament for an old friend, three times.</p>
<p>(Note) In the first year of Guangde, the Duke traveled between Zi and Min, almost leaving the Gorge. Hearing that Yan Wu had been reappointed to Shu as the Duke of Lu, he rebuilt the thatched cottage. Wu appointed him as a staff counselor, inspecting the work of the Ministry of Works, and bestowed upon him a fish bag. The Duke was fifty years old. The Duke admired Li Bai all his life, but his true confidant was Yan Wu (see my book Du Fu, Li Bai, and Yan Wu). The poems he gave and exchanged during Guangde are more than ten! History says that when Wu returned to Zhen, he resented the Duke's slowness and disrespect, and wanted to kill the Duke and Zaomo, hanging their hats on hooks three times, but Yi was beaten to death, and the Duke was spared. According to this account in "Yunxi Youyi," Yi returned to court in March, and Wu arrived in the autumn. How could Yi be killed? Therefore, harming the Duke is even more absurd. It is just the words of Qi Shu Yeren. The Duke's reply to Wu's poem "Xie An did not reduce his climbing and gazing expenses, and Ruan Ji knew nothing of tolerance," shows that the two were close friends. Moreover, there are many poems praising Zhongcheng Yan as proof! In January of the first year of Yongtai, he resigned from the staff and returned to his thatched cottage. In April, Yan Wu died, and in May he left Shu to the south. From Rongzhou to Yuzhou, in June he arrived in Zhongzhou and lived there in autumn. There is a poem lamenting the return of the coffin of Yan Pushe, "A lament in the Three Gorges at dusk, his affection seen in his legacy," and the Duke never returned to the thatched cottage from then on.</p>
<p>He only takes the drunkard's rice wine to get drunk,</p>
<p>The magistrate of Zhongzhou is not friendly;</p>
<p>The setting sun slants over the empty mountain, the Yu Temple,</p>
<p>Looking north, how can he bear to bid farewell to the Latter Lord!</p>
<p>Turning his head, a vast expanse of cuckoos,</p>
<p>Chen Fu lowers his head and weeps as if诉訟;</p>
<p>Heaven and earth do not know Song Wang's sorrow,</p>
<p>Mistakenly taking the autumn mood as a resignation;</p>
<p>People say that old age makes poetry meticulous,</p>
<p>I feel that Kui Prefecture's poetry is even more bitter;</p>
<p>Ten thousand miles of wind and smoke, bandits are rampant,</p>
<p>Night after night, a lonely boat, a weeping widow,</p>
<p>Entering and leaving the Gorge, what is it for?</p>
<p>All because hunger prevents him from staying.</p>
<p>Cherishing a few years of thinking about a grand tour,</p>
<p>The old doctor pleasingly recounted his youthful life;</p>
<p>The landscape and figures are all sighs,</p>
<p>The language of heaven during the Dali era;</p>
<p>The gains and losses of writing are in the inch square,</p>
<p>His friends have withered and all have passed away;</p>
<p>Forcibly relying on servants to make a living,</p>
<p>Malaria is often inflicted by mountain demons;</p>
<p>Why bother clinging to life?</p>
<p>He follows a small boat down the Ruanpu.</p>
<p>(Note) The Duke's poems from Kui Prefecture are like "Chushi Biao" and "Zhengqi Ge," sharing the same heaven and earth, the same sun and moon! Those who only praise his writing for its brilliance cannot fully grasp Du. The Duke's poems from the Gorge include "Forcing himself up, relying on children and servants" and "Lying sick, recognizing mountain demons," showing his extreme sorrow. In the second year of Dali, the Duke moved to Langxi in Kui Prefecture. In January of the third year, he left Kui Prefecture, exiting the Gorge. In March, he arrived in Jiangling. In the autumn, he moved to Gong'an, and in the late winter, he went to Yuezhou, never returning to Shu.</p>
<p>In Hunan as a guest, through spring and summer,</p>
<p>Wine is difficult to pour away the bitterness of the Western Land;</p>
<p>A conversation, a laugh, not as he wished,</p>
<p>He falls into the trap of Mi Heng, sacrificing himself for Huang Zu;</p>
<p>Wearing artemisia, Du followed Qu Yuan,</p>
<p>The depths of the Zhixi Stream are not easy to cross;</p>
<p>Forced to drink on a good day, unable to rejoice,</p>
<p>One night, the constellation Ji lost its rhythm!</p>
<p>The Shrine of the Shu Prime Minister, the Huanhua Temple,</p>
<p>Sends images of purity and loftiness, alongside eternity;</p>
<p>Outside the Jin Guan City, when the sun sets,</p>
<p>Where can the old woodcutter be found for the winter sacrifice?</p>
<p>Poetry scrolls remain long in the world,</p>
<p>For ten thousand years, the thatched cottage honors Du Fu!</p>
<p>(Note) The Duke died in the fifth year of Dali, at the age of fifty-nine. He entered Hengzhou to avoid the rebellion of Zang Jie, and then went to Leiyang, anchoring at Fangtian Post, and died there. The thatched cottage temple in Chengdu is said to be the ruins.</p>
<h3>Preface to "Yangzhou to Suzhou"</h3>
<p>— Yaojiang Bin</p>
<p>Talking about Travel Poems</p>
<p>During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, I was far away in a mountain city. Everything made me unable to forget the occupied half of our country; I especially missed the distant Jiangnan!</p>
<p>Since returning east, I have often traveled between the north and south of the Yangtze River for the sake of life, had the opportunity to see many phenomena of war, and also the opportunity to see many facts of glossing over the truth, but what I was interested in were not those disputes over right and wrong in the world, nor those superficial prosperities; but those desolate suburbs, dilapidated scenic spots, and the rivers and mountains after many tribulations that were ignored by people.</p>
<p>Whenever I have a little free time, I go to the lakes and mountains. Many pavilions and towers have really been buried by the war! Although this gives people a sense of vicissitudes, it is gratifying to be able to revisit the old places and see the remaining mountains and waters after the war. Whenever I return from a tired journey, I jot down a few notes, including eight poems. In terms of region: it includes the Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Jurong, Suzhou, and Wuxi areas; in terms of scenic spots: it is from Slender West Lake to Jinshan, to Jiaoshan; to Maoshan; all the way to Taihu Lake, to Tianping Mountain... Now compiled into a book called "Yangzhou to Suzhou", it is considered a collection of travel poems, let it leave a little trace of the mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>Writing about the scenic beauty of lakes and mountains with new poems is obviously an attempt. My idea is this: Poetry should have a kind of artistic conception, a kind of emotion, and a kind of rhythm. The great rivers and mountains originally have their own great and profound realm; those pine wind and water moon, those setting sun tower shadows, those pavilions, bridges, forests and gardens, are originally objects of appreciation, most rich in poetic meaning; those wind and thunder pine waves, those warbling orioles and chattering swallows, those ancient temple bells and fishermen's songs and woodcutters' chants, are simply symphonic movements of mountains and rivers and figures between heaven and earth, the most simple melody, the most natural grand chorus.</p>
<p>The reason why people are fond of mountains and rivers and miss scenic spots is because there are many lovely artistic conceptions in the mountains and rivers, many commendable, weeping, and immortal historical sites, a harmonious sentiment, and those strange and unrestrained inspirations of the mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>I am not a painter, I cannot depict those mountains and rivers and towers; I am not a musician, I cannot sing wildly between famous mountains and great rivers! In the past, although I have been to many poetic rivers and mountains and valleys, heard many ape cries and tiger roars in the mountains and fields, and also mourned those heroes and beauties who contributed to their hometowns and entrusted their feelings to the mountains and rivers; and those commendable and weeping historical dramas, those witty and humorous anecdotes, those characteristics that fully express the local beauty... Often, I was unable to grasp reality and write anything down, the time and space made my past memories more and more vague, thinking about it, it is really regrettable!</p>
<p>Yangzhou to Suzhou is very close, and the scope of my travels is especially limited. But this is an area of ​​clear mountains and beautiful waters north and south of the Yangtze River, it represents the beauty of oriental landscapes, has typical Jiangnan scenery; and history has left her many ancient sites, war has given her many ruthless destructions; the stories of those national heroes in ancient times, the sentiments of a generation of beauties, have spread all over the world. Recently, I am very happy to be able to take time out of my busy schedule to visit these places, but how can these poems fully describe the beauty of these rivers and mountains? How can it sing out her feelings?</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope to read more travelogues and poems that sing about mountains and rivers and depict customs; and I hope that one day: my footprints will go further and further, climb the mountain peaks that soar into the clouds, or go to the boundless ocean!</p>
<h3>The Sky of the Alps from Sunrise to Sunset</h3>
<p>— Written by John Ruskin, Translated by Sai Lai</p>
<p>At dawn, when the night fog first rises from the plains, standing on some isolated mountain peaks, watching those white, lake-like layers of clouds fly over the low island-like mountain ridges, like lake water wrapping around flat, curved lake edges. There is only the influence of the clear morning, but they are even more calm and cold than the windless sea under the midnight moonlight. When the first rays of sunlight fall on the silver cloud gorges, see how the bubbles on those undulating surfaces separate and move away; and below, in the middle of those white winding river channels, the shining cities and green pastures lie like the Atlantic Ocean. Among those glittering spires, as the encircling waves break and disappear above them, the sunlight gradually shines deeper and faster. Then, the peaks and ridges of those dark mountain ranges clumsily shorten their gray shadows on the plains. …Stop for a moment, you will see that the scattered fog will soon merge again at the foot of the mountains, and then slowly rise along the winding valleys towards where you are standing, until they have become large blocks, dyed in five colors by the morning sunlight and quietly lying on the broad chest of the high mountains. Then the swollen undulating outline will gradually melt, melt, and disappear in the strong light belt, and then reappear in the tranquil sky above, losing its brilliance, like an ancient, gorgeous, fantastical dream, for no reason, as if impossibly, their original foundation disappears below in the illusory and mocking blue of the deep lake. ……Wait a moment, you will see those fog blocks pile themselves into white high towers, huge and solid, standing like fortresses along the strait, constantly rising higher into the sky, and the shadows lying diagonally on the stones will become longer and longer. Over there, in the gray-blue of the horizon, a narrow, dark and powerful spirit is forming, advancing, they will cover the sky inch by inch with their gray nets, taking away the light on the ground with a kind of convergence that makes birds stop singing and leaves stop swaying. Then you will see horizontal blocks of black shadows forming below them; at the same time, inexplicably, pale white eddies have surrounded the mountain shoulders. ——You didn't see its formation, but when you turn your head to look at the place that was clear a moment ago, there is already a cloud hanging on that cliff, like an eagle lingering over its prey. ……Then, you will hear the awakened wind suddenly rushing past, and the watchtowers made of clouds will be uprooted one by one and blown away; then the undulating, hazy rain curtain falls in the valley, with black curved tassels swaying from the clouds that have been relieved of their burden, or becoming columns of gray rain, coming and going on the lake surface, causing small bubbles on the lake surface.</p>
<p>Then, when the sun goes down, you can see the sudden storm rushing down from the mountains. Foaming on the wide edge, still snowy white with eerie water vapor, tattered, disappearing for a while, and gathering again. At this time, the sun, which seems to be burning only beside you like a red ball, can almost be touched, and suddenly rushes anxiously through the wind and rolling clouds that come and go and falls down, as if it will dye the entire sky red with its blood, and will never rise again: then you will hear the gradually disappearing commotion finally die completely in the emptiness of the night, and a green glow begins to shine on the eastern mountains, slowly brightening up, brightening up, until the big white moon has gradually stepped into the clouds step by step. Then it lights up the stars in the sky one by one, forming a gray, transparent flower crown like wool, illuminating the earth; they move hand in hand, foot to foot, accompanying each other step by step, as if the whole sky is also rolling, and the earth is staggering below. ……Wait another hour, until the eastern sky reappears in purple, and the swollen mountains move like waves in the sea in the darkness, slowly appearing one by one in its brilliance; look at those white glacier-like curved vortices left by them when they pass through the mountains, aren't they like the all-powerful demon king and his artillery? Look at those lonely snow-capped peaks one by one, shining one after another below, isn't each one a new clear morning? Look, their long ice mountains collapse with light brighter than lightning, sending every broken snowflake into the sky like smoke from an altar; the rose-colored light of the calm dome shines upwards beside them, placing new light through the rising clouds with a purer light, until the entire sky, a red canopy, has been woven with a roof of undulating flames, and then trembling, jumping one after another, as if the wings spread by countless groups of angels. Then, when you have seen enough and are exhausted, when you have succumbed to the love and terror of this God of Creation, please tell me who brought this "divine" message to the world!</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>So you risked your life to find the original copy, didn't you? Then, you will be disappointed again and again. What's the reason? To tell you the truth, our "secret codes" etc. do not have a so-called "original copy".</p>
<p>Of course, those daily notes in our notebooks, sunny or rainy days, etc., are extremely important secret messages. If there is no original copy, even if we always remember them, wouldn't we even forget them ourselves after a long time?</p>
<p>That's not true either. You probably still remember Tsurumi's invention of a simple secret code? He does have expertise in this type of work. The way we record things in our notebooks is also based on his secret code, with slight modifications. His secret lies in mechanical changes, combined with organic changes. Mechanical changes are a fixed method, requiring no great memory, like the "multiplication table" in arithmetic, once memorized, it can be applied forever. Organic changes, however, require a slight reliance on memory, but because they are interspersed with mechanical fixed methods, and the organic changes are controlled by mechanical rules, as long as the ability to deduce is strong, they can be explained, and no great memory is required.</p>
<p>Therefore, we members of the grain association understand the things recorded in our own notebooks very well. At a glance, we know that a certain item refers to tea matters, and it is not easy for even one in ten thousand errors to occur. Not only that, we all understand each other's secret codes; this is because the methods we use are all a system.</p>
<p>As for how to create this mechanical-organic fusion method, it is not easy to explain at once. I will give you an example, and you may understand it at a glance. For example, Tsurumi's record about "July 31st, riding the seaplane 'Pioneer', being summoned back to Tokyo, being closely monitored by two military adjutants, and losing freedom of action, like a criminal:" In his notebook, it is:</p>
<p>"Cloudy, two friends strongly invited me to go swimming in the sea, I could not refuse." Based on the facts already written, you have probably realized how this method is formed. The rest that needs to be interpreted are the points "Tokyo trip", "seaplane", and "Pioneer". But it is extremely simple: "Tokyo trip" is hidden in the word "sea"; because according to Tsurumi's departure point on that day was in China, only the east is the sea; in other words, the word sea indicates the direction of travel, and the "east" in the direction clearly indicates the destination "Tokyo".</p>
<p>As for the representative term for "seaplane", it is the word "bathing", which is our original mechanical term, but also contains organic changes, which can be inferred in detail. If it is a land plane, the terms we use include "riding a horse", "driving a car", "rice ball", "dagger", "automatic pen", etc. The term "Pioneer" is implied in the shape of the word "to"; at the same time, in the old Japanese military song, there is a familiar line, "Brave warriors lead the way to the enemy's territory, lead the way to the enemy's territory..." Therefore, seeing the word "to" easily brings to mind the words "Pioneer".</p>
<p>Regarding aircraft names, as well as various fleets, unit numbers, guns, artillery, bombs, military supplies, etc., there is one more thing that must be stated, that is, we who select these types of workers must have extensive collection, and in advance, must draw each of these things, and set a technical name or nickname for each, some are "category names", some are "special names", just like friends in the underworld use afterwords, allusions, pictograms, etc., to create many "slang" and "technical terms".</p>
<p>In addition, Tsurumi did not especially emphasize the aircraft name in that one entry, but just casually recorded it; whether it is definitely "Pioneer" is not very important. In case this aircraft name is particularly important, his record will have a special way to express the name.</p>
<p>"Damn it, Bazis..." Tsurumi was somewhat surprised when he saw me use this Northeast curse on him. After a chuckle, he paused for a moment, but unexpectedly came up with another one, as if deliberately trying to make me laugh.</p>
<p>"What's going on, old Tsurumi?" I asked intentionally or unintentionally; of course, I was asking about his strange language.</p>

<h3>Plastics and Modern Civilization</h3>
<p>— Meng Kun</p>
<p>The progress of human culture is often categorized by the materials used in their material lives. Thus, historians have distinguished the Paleolithic Age, the Neolithic Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. These ages span tens of thousands of years and only employed natural materials; humans could not create new objects themselves. Since the advent of celluloid, glass, bakelite, alloys, as well as artificial silk, artificial rubber, and artificial ivory, humankind has learned to use scientific methods to manufacture materials with new properties, suitable for specific tools. Finally, plastics were invented. The diversity of plastics in various performances exceeds all previously manufactured synthetic products, almost able to be matched to any need according to human desires. In this way, the human lifestyle has been greatly improved, surpassing previous generations. Therefore, some call the era we live in "the Age of Plastics," signifying its progressive significance over the Iron Age and others.</p>
<p>The invention of plastics, strictly speaking, dates back about a hundred years, but its actual practical application has only been in the last decade. The invention process of plastics, as well as other specific publications, have already been introduced in considerable detail, so there is no need to repeat them here.</p>
<p>We commonly refer to plastics as "glass," which is incorrect. Moreover, simply speaking of "glass" only points to a certain type of plastic, failing to encompass the "versatility" of plastics. Plastic is a category, a general name, encompassing hundreds and thousands of different materials with different properties, catering to various needs. Its properties vary from place to place. It can mimic almost any property that other materials possess. Therefore, in the future world, plastics will undoubtedly replace all raw materials and become the sole material source for human life.</p>
<p>It can have various properties. Generally speaking, it can have different degrees of hardness, ductility, strength, or softness. It can be lubricating, colored, patterned, fireproof, or flammable. It can be rustproof, salt-resistant, and acid-resistant. It can be moisture-resistant and temperature-resistant. It can be very light and clean. It can be heat-resistant and impact-resistant. It can be transparent and electrically insulating. It can be elastic and reflective. It is odorless, does not shrink or crack, and is easy to and possesses other properties. In fact, possessing these properties is equivalent to possessing all properties. Therefore, materials like metal, wood, rubber, ceramics, miscellaneous, paper, alloys, and glass will only be replaced sooner or later. The future of human life is bound to rely on plastics.</p>
<p>To date, the relationship between plastics and humans is quite close. No one can completely reject or resist its allure. Many things that used to be made from other materials are now made from plastics, which are not too expensive and extremely convenient. Here, let us mention some plastic products that have already achieved considerable success in human life.</p>
<p>1.  Housing. We often hear terms like mobile homes, which are often made entirely of plastics. Even in older houses and other buildings, the application of plastics is gradually expanding. It can replace steel frames as various structures, and it can replace cement and wood as walls, doors, windows, and accessories. It can replace glass, floors, and screens, often made of plastics. Coatings and paints also use another type of plastic. Stairs, roofs, curtains, bathtubs, etc., are also the same. In addition, there are furniture, electric lights, telephones, electric stoves, and other various items.</p>
<p>2.  Clothing. Plastics can replace wool and other fabrics. From spring wear, summer wear, to winter wear, all kinds of clothing can use plastics as raw materials. Raincoats and overcoats can be made. Most buttons are now made of plastics. Shoe heels, shoe uppers, purses, and suitcases can all use plastics. In addition, besides ties, artificial flowers, and certain ornaments that can be made from plastics, even accessories such as pens, cigarette holders, lighters, hair clips, glasses, and watchbands that are carried around are mostly made of plastics. Of course, hats, felt blankets, gloves, socks, shawls, suspenders, and underwear, shirts, and bathrobes made of plastics are also commonly seen.</p>
<p>3.  Transportation. By the year the Great War ended, there were already airplanes and cars made of plastics, but not entirely; they were limited to the walls, covers, wheels, and other parts. Now there are plastic cables, yachts, and bicycles. In terms of parts, its application is even wider, such as light regulators, transparent glass, inlays, roadbeds, switches, and signal lights.</p>
<p>4.  Hygiene. In medicine, plastics were first used in instruments and appliances, such as instrument racks, bottles, masks, mirrors, artificial human models, and other surgical instruments. In addition, sutures and dentures for dental use, as well as prosthetic legs, are also made of plastics.</p>
<p>5.  Entertainment. Almost all sports equipment can be made of plastics. Photographic equipment and its parts are also the same. There are plastic yachts, fishing gear, and radios. Records and movie screens, etc. Many children's toys are made of plastics. Gambling supplies, such as playing cards, mahjong, and dice, also often use it. Musical instruments, from the piano keys, can all be made of plastics.</p>
<p>6.  Other aspects. In publishing, plastics first replaced lead type and can also be used as raw materials for printing plates. Both heavy industry and light industry use it extensively. The caps on food products have recently been made of plastics. Chemical machinery is most suitable made with plastics. In addition, typewriters, fire sprinklers, urban water pipes, art models, radios, etc., also use it extensively. Moreover, even war is inevitably related to plastics, but this is not a symbol of human happiness.</p>

<h3>Talking About Electrons</h3>
<p>— Xiu Wu</p>
<p>All things in the universe, in various forms and colors, from distant suns, moons, and stars to nearby pavilions and towers, from the stillness of green hills and clear waters to the movement of flying birds and running animals, though diverse in form and different in nature, are all, in the eyes of physicists, called matter.</p>
<p>It is universally recognized by physicists that all matter is composed of molecules. The molecules that constitute matter in the universe have different properties but are exactly the same in size. Under the same temperature, pressure, and volume, the number of molecules contained is uniformly equal. For example, air at normal temperature and pressure contains 27×10-18 molecules in a cubic centimeter of volume. If we densely arrange the air molecules in this cubic centimeter, the length of this row could encircle the Earth's equator 200 times. The size of this number is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>However, molecules are composed of atoms. Forty years ago, scientists universally recognized atoms as the smallest unit of matter. It was not until 1895 that J.J. Thomson proved that atoms were not the smallest unit and that electrons were the smallest unit of matter. Moreover, the number of different types of matter in the universe is countless, and there are ninety-two kinds of atoms, but all electrons are the same, without any difference. Therefore, matter originates from one kind of electron, which creates ninety-two kinds of atoms, and these ninety-two kinds of atoms combine into countless molecules, which then bind together to form all things in the universe. Matter.</p>
<p>Things seem like a grain of millet in the vast ocean, and the numbers are so astounding that they defy description. Let's consider the three aspects of electrons: "charge," "diameter," and "mass."</p>
<p>The charge of each electron is 1.50×10-19 Coulombs. To make readers understand how incredibly small this number is, let's say there is a 100-watt light bulb. The number of electrons passing through it in one hour is as many as 22680×10-18. The largeness of this number indicates how small the charge of an electron is. Let's make an analogy. Suppose an ordinary person can count one hundred times per minute, with sixty minutes in an hour, twenty-four hours in a day (without sleeping all night), and three hundred and sixty-five days a year (without resting for a day). He can count about 53 million electrons per year. If we mobilize all 460 million people in China (men, women, old, and young) to do this electron counting work, it would take a million years to count the number of electrons needed to light a 100-watt light bulb for one hour. But history tells us that from the time of Emperor Yao to the present, there have only been over four thousand years!</p>
<p>Looking at the diameter of the electron, it is 2×10-13 cm. It would take 500 million million electrons lined up to make one centimeter.</p>
<p>The mass of an electron is 9×10-28 grams. It would take 11000000000000000000000000000 electrons to make one gram. We know that one thousand grams is one kilogram. The lightness of this electron is truly indescribable. The intelligent reader should be able to understand this twenty-eight-digit number.</p>
<h3>London Fog</h3>
<p>— Ge Ming</p>
<p>Fog is actually just clouds at ground level. We don't fully understand how it forms, so it's difficult to predict its occurrence with certainty. Sea fog often appears in the summer—June is the worst month in the English Channel, which is one reason why the United States and Britain deliberately chose that time for the Normandy landings in France—but on land, fog is a mid-winter phenomenon. These are foggy days in London, averaging rarely more than twenty days a year. But there were a total of eighty-six days in 1886; and only thirteen days in 1900, which was an exception.</p>
<p>Careful comparison of urban and rural conditions suggests that urban fog is not caused by coal smoke—these only make it denser. But sulfuric acid in urban air, like salt in the sea, promotes the condensation of water vapor into fine droplets.</p>
<p>The water droplets in fog are only about one-millionth of an inch in diameter—the coal smoke particles contained within are even smaller. If you walk in London fog for an hour, you will inhale 140,000 coal smoke particles. In Manchester, this number would increase by about 50%. Five days of fog in Glasgow weigh 1,300 tons and can generate 7,000 kilowatts of electricity.</p>
<h3>A History of Microscopes</h3>
<p>— Pan Chenglie</p>
<p>Tracing the history of the microscope is somewhat difficult. The first to create a convex lens and a single microscope was likely Roger Bacon in the 13th century. The first microscope was made with a single lens. We know little of the history after that until the 17th century, when a Dutchman named Anton van Leeuwenhoek began grinding lenses and making glass capable of magnifying objects in his spare time. Later, he became famous, so much so that many travelers to the Netherlands regarded seeing his microscope as a major event. At that time, Leeuwenhoek did not have a definite research plan, merely pointing the microscope at whatever was at hand. He examined his own blood and discovered its red cell composition. He also studied spiders, ants, eggs, bees, and other small insects. One day, he examined the tartar in his teeth and was amazed to find many small dots and rods. But this important discovery was not valued. He was the first to see bacteria—those tiny organisms that affect health and disease. But Leeuwenhoek did not realize the importance of his invention. In fact, it was not known until two hundred years later.</p>
<p>Another Dutchman named Jansen, while working in his father's eyewear store, discovered that placing two lenses in a tube could clearly see distant objects. This news spread to Italy, and the astronomer Galileo, upon learning of this, began designing an instrument that could observe celestial bodies. As a result, his telescope made objects appear a thousand times larger and thirty times closer than seen with the naked eye.</p>
<p>These instruments gradually developed, and things that were initially invisible to the instrument can now be seen clearly. Microscopes and telescopes have opened up an invisible world for us. It is said that the naked eye can only see three thousand stars, but Galileo's telescope allows one to see a million. The large telescope on Mount Wilson can photograph nearly two hundred million. There are many reasons to believe that if we invent a telescope with even stronger magnification, we can see that the Milky Way is composed of trillions of stars. But there is not yet a telescope that can prove this.</p>
<p>The microscope is now the most useful tool for doctors. With it, he learns a lot about the structure and function of the body.</p>
<p>For example, the microscope tells us that every organ and tissue in the body is based on cells. We can see these cells and study them. The cells in different organs of the body are different, so the microscopic observation of tissues indicates which organ they come from. At the same time, their functions also have great practical value. Suppose someone has a tumor in their chest. Doctors often cannot tell whether surgery is necessary based on feeling alone. He then consults a pathologist. While the patient is still under anesthesia, he quickly takes a piece of this tissue to examine it. The microscope will tell him whether it is cancer or not.</p>
<p>Using a microscope, we can count red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, thereby knowing whether there is blood deficiency or other diseases. The normal number of red blood cells is about five million per cubic millimeter, and white blood cells are seven thousand five hundred. These are quite important. Many diseases can increase white blood cells, such as pneumonia and appendicitis. In addition, there are also many diseases, such as influenza and tuberculosis, where the blood cell count is either normal or reduced.</p>
<p>Similarly, the microscope is of valuable help in studying various endocrine secretions in the body, as well as in mycology and sponge tumors. It can also be used to distinguish different parasites. We find it strange how doctors could carry out their work a hundred years ago without it.</p>
<p>The microscope allows people to see things clearly and observe what has never been seen before, realizing that the world is so vast that there is nothing that is not there. Its contribution to science is truly immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Arctic Temperature Increase</h3>
<p>— Liu Dade</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the Arctic climate is extremely cold, but strangely, the climate there is gradually warming. According to Dr. Hans Ahlmann, a famous Swedish soil scientist, since 1900, the Arctic temperature has increased by ten degrees Fahrenheit. During the same period, the water temperature in the Arctic Ocean in the strategically important Spitsbergen area has increased by three to five degrees Fahrenheit. Since the temperature is gradually increasing, it is obvious that the glaciers will melt faster, and thus the water level will rise by one to one and a half millimeters each year. These numbers may not seem like much to ordinary people, but in the eyes of a scientist, this is truly a huge number. Although the phenomenon of climate change has been discovered in recent years, its underlying causes remain unexplained. Of course, we can also assume that this is one of the characteristics of the Earth. But no matter what the reason, Ahlmann believes that this phenomenon is causing a serious international problem. Let us imagine that if the frozen areas of Antarctica and the massive icebergs of Greenland also melt at the same rate, then the ocean surface will rise and become a disaster. People living along the coast will suffer from severe flooding.</p>
<p>There are also examples of climate change in other parts of the world. For example, in the past fifteen to twenty years, we have known that there have been significant climate changes in tropical regions, especially in West Africa, where many small lakes have completely disappeared, and larger lakes are gradually drying up. Even the extremely large Lake Victoria has dropped by seven inches in the past decade. From these examples, we can see that the climate change in the Arctic is not impossible.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the climate change in the Arctic has given mankind some convenience, as it has improved navigation in the northern edges of Europe, and the Soviet Union has benefited greatly from this. In 1910, the navigation season along the west coast of Spitsbergen was only three months, but now it has increased to eight months. Therefore, in terms of world strategic importance, climate change is very beneficial.</p>
<p>However, the perspective of a scientist is different from that of a military strategist. Scientists, in addition to considering current interests, are also concerned about the permanent happiness of mankind. Therefore, when Ahlmann thought about the huge potential disaster that could be caused by the gradual climate change in the Arctic, he believed that the situation was extremely serious and advocated organizing an international organization on a global basis to specifically study and solve this problem.</p>
<p>Ahlmann is a professor of geography at Stockholm University and the director of the Swedish Geographical Society. He has conducted research work in the research room of the Department of Geography at the University of California for more than twenty years. With such rich knowledge and experience, his emphasis on raising this issue deserves our attention.</p>
