<h3>政府鼓勵輸出貿易　採行出口津貼制度　國防會通過今日起實施</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕國防最高委員會五日上午十時在國府開會，出席三十餘人，蔣主席親臨主持，通過要案如下：</p>
<p>甲，政府為鼓勵輸出，對出口貨品結匯，就其輸出價格，由政府給予百分之一百之補助費。（東九省及台灣除外）對於若干類之進口貨品，依海關估價徵收從價百分之五十之附加費。去年十一月十七日公布之修正進口貿易暫行辦法附表一之全部機器，及生產用品及附表二之米小麥·粉·煤及焦炭，棉花，肥料及硫酸　等品（所有上項免徵附加稅之貨品，均為生產及日用必需品，可當全部進口貨品百分之六十）及在二月五日以前業經到達各口之進口貨品，均予免徵。</p>
<p>乙，增加山西國民參政員名額四名。</p>
<p>丙，中央設計局與黨政考核委會合併為設計考核處，直隸國府。丁，國府增設法制局。戊，立委王秉謙病逝出缺，以楊　熉繼。己，任楊宗培為監委。</p>
<p>又蕭委員錚等曾提出「實施計劃經濟，以挽救經濟危機，並奠立復興基礎案」，經決議交經濟專門委會，會同最高經濟委會及設計局，於二週內擬　實施辦法提會。</p>
<p>按此案係革新運動座談會，經濟研究組約　黨內專家卅餘人，經半年餘之討論研究決定。由蕭錚，賀衷寒，梁寒操，劉健羣，賴璉等，共同具名提出，其內容要點如次：第一部，確立經濟計劃之體系。第二部，確立實施農地改革，創施新農業制度，為經濟建設計劃之中心。第三部，就實施農業制度計劃，工礦貿易交通等事業之發展。第四部，實施計劃經濟之資金，並穩定貨幣與物價。</p>
<p>宋院長談話</p>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕行政院為鼓勵出口貨品之產運，五日已提奉國防最高委員會議通過獎勵辦法，於二月六日起實施，中宣部長彭學沛，五日下午四時記者招待會上，宣布宋院長對此所發表之書面談話如下：「我國自經長期抗戰，輸出貿易，已瀕於停頓，因之內地經濟生機，亦將瀕絕，自勝利以來，因各地交通破壞，迄今未能恢復，內地所生產之貨物，感覺運輸阻滯之痛苦，如經過里程及時間之加長，資金之積壓，運費之增加，貨品成本，亦遂加重，益以利率之增高，不數月間，成本或已加倍，復以出口貨品之品質，有待改良，標準有待規定，凡此種種困難阻碍，遂致輸出貿易，仍難推展。</p>
<p>政府為謀解除上述各種困難，並悉力研討方策，以鼓勵出口貨品之生產與輸出。故於最高經濟委員會之下，設置輸出推廣委員會來於本年一月十五日成立。同時政府並深信欲使我國輸出貿易，樹立永久健全之基礎，必須集中工商界之經騐與力量方能有濟，故輸出推廣委員會，現正延聘中外資望較深之工商界人士，充任顧問，協助工作，以期達到所負推進督導，及研討發展輸出貿易之重要任務，其本身並不經營任何輸出貿易，更無獨佔控制輸出貿易之意。</p>
<h3>出口貨品結匯時　給予百分之百補助費</h3>
<p>行政院根據最高經濟委員會輸出推廣委員會所研討之意見，本日已提奉國防最高委員會議通過鼓勵輸出貿易辦法，於二月六日起實施，即自二月六日起，對於出口貨品結匯時，就其輸出價格，由政府給予百分之一百之補助費，除東九省及台灣省輸出之貨品，因其幣值，對於物資之輸出處於較有利之地位，無庸補助外，一律適用於任何口岸輸出之貨品，此項補助費之籌措，政府并已決定自二月六日起對於進口類之貨品，依海關估價，徵收從價百分之五十之　加費，但去年十一月十七日公布之修正進出口貿易暫行辦法附表（一）之全部機器及生產用品，及附表（二）之米，小麥，小麥粉，煤及焦炭，棉花，肥料及硫酸錏等，均予免征，所有此項免征附加費之進口貨品，均為生產及日用必需品，約可當全部進口貨品總值百分之六十。其他貨品，凡在二月五日以前，業經到達各口者，亦均予免征。</p>
<p>上述辦法，實施以後，可使輸出貿易，趨於活潑，對於促進對外貿易，及復蘇內地經濟，實為當前必要之措施也。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕中宣部五日下午四時招待記者，發表宋院長書面談話，說明最高經濟委會設立輸出推廣委會經過，公布鼓勵輸出貿易辦法。</p>
<h3>出口物資生產量　可能因此而增加</h3>
<p>金融業某領袖談話</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕政府已採行出口津貼制度，對若干項輸入品，並提高其進口稅額。記者昨特趨訪金融業某領袖，據觀察：政府對外匯及進出口政策，原已有統盤之籌劃，現則逐步付諸實施。渠分析：先自開放外匯市場，而臻於調整外匯率階段，再進於實施全面輸入許可制度，以達於出口津貼制度。此蓋為盱衡國內國外經濟金融情勢，所擬具之唯一合理施策。據渠解釋：如政府出口津貼為百分之一百，即係照現行外匯率三三五〇元加倍六七〇〇元，收購各出口商之匯票。同時，以增加進口稅所得，彌補各出口商，實為一舉兩得。渠不信國內出出口物資，將因此而增價。惟推測可能因此而增加出口物資之生產量。同時，應設法使和產商多受其惠，取締中間商之盤剝。至我國出口物資之國際市場價格，是否將因此而跌價，渠認為亦不必悲觀。蓋國際市場之顧主甚多，需要者固不限於一國。由於競爭作用，價格亦不致趨跌。所望我國出口商，能善自利用此良機，力爭上游，則我國輸出事業，庶有豸乎。</p>
<h3>外匯調整謠傳　無形驟失支持</h3>
<p>金鈔物價當趨於平穩</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日市場傳門政府決採行出口津貼制度後，醞釀已久之外匯調整謠傳，無形驟失支持，故下午金鈔市况，即趨平寂。據各方觀察所及，出現口律貼制度及提高進口稅率並付實施後，現行外匯率之缺陷，可望即予彌補，調整之說，已無需要。預料今後我國進口之　差，可望逐步好轉。國際支付，亦可步入平衡狀態。金，鈔，物價，當亦自然趨於平穩。</p>
<h3>左舜生意見</h3>
<p>中共聲明不能獲結果</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕記者頃以共產黨所發表之聲明，强調政協之權力，以及表示對政府對外所定條約及其他各種手續如借款等予以否認一事，詢青年黨意見？據左舜生談：共產黨關閉和談之門，政協即已失却效力，至於共產黨不能承認及負責對外各種交涉，吾人認為不能獲得任何結果。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕左舜生談：一年來共產黨失敗之關鍵有三：（一）為拒絕國軍接收東北。（二）為拒絕張家口停戰十天。（三）為最近之堅持兩項先決條件，關閉和談之門。共產黨經此三誤，似已難得轉寰餘地。</p>
<h3>輸出推廣委員會　聘請中外人士為顧問</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕自修正進出口貿易暫行辦法公布後，輸入方面管理事宜，已由最高經濟委員會設立輸入臨時管理委員會專責辦理。該會近又經呈准設立輸出推廣委員會，以為督導，並協助發展對外貿易之機構。</p>
<p>輸出推廣委員長為主任委員，並以財政部部長，經濟部部長，交通部部長，農林部部長，中央銀行總裁，資源委員會委員長，及最高經濟委員會委員長，所指定之人員，（現已指定者為鄒秉文博士）為委員，其任務為：（一）研討並解除國內各地各項出口物資所遭遇之各種困難。（二）與農林部合作，獎勵出口農業品之生產，及其數量之增加，並於必要時，協助舉辦加工製造事業，以利出口。（三）調整現行各項協助出口貿易之方法，並澈底加以改善，期使原有各有關事業能迅速達成現代化，藉利出口貿易。（四）促進國外消費市場，對我出口貨品之穩定，及廣大需要。</p>
<h3>推進工作起見　設置執行委會</h3>
<p>該會為便利工作推進起見，另設置一執行委員會，由中央銀行總裁兼主任委員最高經濟委員會所指派之一人（楊效仁）為副主任委員，交通部代表一人（金士宣），中央信託局局長（劉攻芸），及中央銀行業務局局長（林鳳苞）為委員，負責向該會提供各項有關政策之建議，並執行該會所已制定之方案。</p>
<p>此外該會並已聘請出口貿易界中外知名人士，如王仰先，古耕，虞往，謝康，李銳，徐廣遲，郭士勳，束雲章，張嘉籌，陳長桐，歐陽崙，哈克遜（U.S.Hearkson）克士威克（J.H.Keswock）馬克爾，（A.E.Markr）羅傑士，（C.Rogers）李特而（J.H.Liddell）等，為該會顧問，以期集思廣益。</p>
<h3>各地區域分會　正積極籌組中</h3>
<p>執行委員會依照規定，得就國內各重要商埠，派駐區域代表或設立分會，俾便聽收各該地區商情報告及改進意見，此項區域代表或分會，並得酌聘當地有經騐之出口商，憂售商，及其他有充任諮詢委員會委員，以便諮詢有關出口貿易之各該業專門問題。上海，天津，青島，廣州，漢口，重慶，潘陽等七地之區域分會，當儘先成立，刻正在積極籌組中。</p>
<h3>王炳南梅益　招待京滬記者</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕共產黨京聯絡處王炳南，梅益，五日八時舉行茶會，招待京滬各報記者，并有秧歌舞等。</p>
<h3>中共聲明內容</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕共產黨一日曾在延安發表聲明，五日在京公布，內容全文强調政協之權力，及自去歲一月十日以後政府向外所作之各種交涉手續，如訂立條約及貸款等。共產黨決定不予承認，并聲明不負任何義務。</p>
<h3>民盟今開中常會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民盟定今日下午三時召開中常會，除處理經常事務外，將研討擴大組織事宜。</p>
<h3>參加政府意見　民社黨已一致</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨於昨日開中常會後，對參加政府之意見已告一致。會後由張君勵，伍憲子，徐夢岩三人聯名發一公告如下：「本黨對於改組政府問題，已有具體意見，不日即提交政府，俟獲得答覆後，再決定本黨態度。」又悉：民社黨之共同意見，即日交雷震秘書長帶京，以供政府參考。據有關人干推測：民社黨意見之內容，不外要求政府提早舉行三中全會及要求以非國民黨人士擔任行政院長等。惟經昨日開會後，可能要求開放地方政權，惟不致如青年黨之堅持。又蔣勻田可能於後日與雷震同晋京。</p>
<h3>撤退駐華美軍事</h3>
<p>衆守不擬請馬帥報告　參議員提案已遭否決</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓四日電〕衆議員外交委員會，本日一致否決共和黨參議員羅吉斯所提，要求說明美國決定撤退駐華軍隊之詳情</p>
<h3>穗渝綫失蹤機　殘骸在黔發現</h3>
<p>〔中央社重慶五日電〕搜索已達十日之中國公司一三八號渝穗班機，今已獲端倪，緣該公司於昨日午後一時，續派一〇九號機擔任搜索工作，歷四小時半，於黔境距南川東南七十五公里處山地，發現C47式機殘骸一具，機身已毀，機翼標幟亦無法認識，惟就航綫推測，可能即為一三八號失蹤航機。</p>
<p>舊歷元宵，又稱燈節，各地舉行燈市，以示慶祝春節。圖示首都燈市之一班。（上）夫子廟之燈市，（中）燈市中出售之扯鈴，（下）首都兒童在燈市中。</p>
<h3>各國商訂條約協定　均以國府為對象　中共否認條約聲明不足重視</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕此間新華社公布延安電訊，中共中央本月一日發表聲明，對去年一月十日以後國府對外所簽訂之條約協定等，概不承認。關於此事，記者向各方刺探反應。據某權威所聞外人方面得到較為確實之情報，謂中共此舉早為預定計劃。蓋自美政府宣告美軍將撤離中國以後，中共即認為其反美宣傳政策之成功，故現在對國府除加緊軍事上之攻勢外，必竭力企圖向國際間表示中共為一獨立之交戰團體，以便引起某種外力之干涉。同時，中共中央已密令國府轄區內之各地黨員，凡身份公開，過去有顯著活動者，一律於最短期間準備撤退或絕端潛伏，一面假手於其外圍灰色份子在各地鼓勵風潮，以配合其軍事上之蠢動。且將在中共顯要份子撤退前後，陰謀在若干大城市中發動暴動，以行動加强「反美」宣傳之力量，甚至有妄稱去年中美簽訂商約之日期即十一月四日為「國恥日」之設計。故中共中央二月一日之聲明，為其題中應有之義，不足重視。美·英·蘇·法以及各聯合國，現均公認國民政府為中華民國之惟一合法政府，除一方希望國府擴大基礎，加强民主氣氛外，一切商訂條約協定，始終以國府為對象，絕不因中共之片面聲明而有所改變。</p>
<h3>魯中收復萊無城　共軍傷耗重大殘部南竄　魯南膠着棗莊附近鏖戰</h3>
<p>〔本報濟南五日電〕退據博山南四十五公里之萊無共軍之營一旅四團，魯中軍區新二團及原在城內担任警衛之新三團及萊無子弟兵共八千餘，經國軍奮勇襲擊後，不支南竄，國軍乃於四日下午四時正式收復萊無城。入城時未遭共軍猛烈抵抗，城內所有財物已被共軍於撤出前刦運一空，其不便携帶之笨重家具及房屋等，亦被共軍縱火焚毀，城區所有水井全遭填塞或破壞，所有居民亦全被共軍　脅以去。國軍入此刦後空城，宿食飲料用具盡　匱乏，補給維艱，而由共軍預埋之地雷及爆炸物，則到處皆是，經工兵發掘不下三百餘處之多。五日晨四鄉難民聞國軍已至，多有設計逃歸者，　道共軍統制下之殘暴情形，莫不聲淚俱下，國軍正予全力扶助，俾得重安生業。</p>
<p>〔中央社濟南五日電〕由吐絲口南進之國軍，四日收復萊無縣城，原駐該處之共軍解九師，解四師各一部及新一旅，均傷耗慘重，殘部向　陰方面村去。國軍於恢復該縣秩序後，繼於五日進至顏莊，各處共軍抵抗甚微，紛紛放械投誠。</p>
<p>〔本報徐州五日電〕魯南戰局漸呈膠着，國軍正加强綏靖工作，今日棗莊附近仍鏖戰，魯第三區專員王洪九，五日晨由徐赴郯城，即隨軍北上，督導地方善後工作。</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州五日電〕劉伯誠部第一縱隊，司令縱隊各一部，刻由曹縣，定陶尚小壩增援。其第三縱隊一部，則向柳河劉口一帶增援，現小壩迄柳河中間地區，戰况甚烈，惟汴，徐間交通尚可照常通車。</p>
<h3>劉伯誠部　受創甚鉅</h3>
<p>〔本報徐州五日電〕劉伯誠為策應魯南共軍作亂，近兩週來已開始對豫·皖邊區發動攻勢，劉部六個縱隊，近已以兩個縱隊滯留魯西，且以鉅野·嘉祥為中心，在津浦·隴海兩路之三角地區流竄，圖牽製國軍，並破壞地方行政組織。又其第六縱隊活動於南邱·碭山南北之隴海路邊緣地帶，隨時窺隙破壞鐵路。另以其第二·第三·第五三個縱隊，分別在隴海路南之杞縣·寗陵·柘城·毫縣境內竄擾，企圖會同原原來活動於豫東·皖北之共軍魏鳳樓·張太生等部，共約五萬人，在豫·皖邊區建立新根據地，再與魯西連結一氣，以便形成一個橫　隴海路及徐鄭兩綏靖區　新的走廊，然後劉伯誠所部東可威脅徐州，西可威脅開封，但軍方刻對共方陰謀業有妥善之對策。</p>
<h3>郯城北郊</h3>
<p>國軍完成綏靖工作　郯徐公路業已暢通</p>
<p>〔中央社徐州五日電〕郯城國軍，五日已完成北郊廿里以內綏靖工作，郯城南至新安鎮啣接，徐州公路修復竣事，郯城徐州間公路交通五日起暢通。</p>
<h3>晋共軍陷文水城</h3>
<p>〔本報北平五日電〕此間獲悉，晋共軍自一日猛攻文水縣城，經數日激戰，該城終於三日下午失陷。初縣附近之子洪口發現共軍薛一波部三個團，有攻該縣企圖，太原東方之壽陽附近，亦有共軍集中。縣城告急，閻長官鑒於太原外圍緊張，共軍最後目的顯在攻太原，乃決定組織防護團，動員太原所有人力物力，武裝自衛現正積極進行中。</p>
<h3>平遙城西禮城村　共軍向西北潰竄</h3>

<h3>彭部長答記者詢問　報紙减縮篇幅為事實需要　根據出版法取締黃色新聞</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京五日電〕中宣部記者招待會五日下午後舉行，由彭部長學沛主持，茲錄主要問答如次：</p>
<p>問：宣傳部根據何種法律，限制報紙篇幅。此種限制，是否亦適用於大陸報等外文報紙。去年進口白報紙，為數若干，動用多少。外匯戰前正常情形下，一年所需之數量多少，實施限制計劃之後，進口數量及所需外匯之估計若何。部長能一一見告否？對於管制「黃色新聞」，宣傳部及內政部另有其他限制計劃否。</p>
<p>答：（一）本部縮減報紙篇幅暫行辦法，係鑒於紙張之缺乏，及節省外匯之需要，並由於京滬兩地，多數報館之請求，乃邀集會商，而獲得協議。此項辦法係通知各地報業公會，自動執行。（二）西文報紙縮减篇幅與否，亦將由各地報業公會，決定辦法。（三）去年四月至十一月八個月間，輸入報紙數額，約值國幣二百五十億元，折合美金約一千一百萬元，如以全年計，當在二千萬美元左右。此數實為戰前報紙每年輸入量值美金三百八十萬之五倍，可見銷耗外匯之多。（四）對於所謂黃色新聞之取締，係完全根據出版法辦理。按出版法第二二條明文規定「出版品不得為防害善良風俗之記載」。同法第三四條，規定「出版品之記載，除有觸犯刑法規定，應依法辦理外，其有違反第二十二條之規定，情形較為重大者，內政部或地方主管各署呈經內政部核准，得禁止其出售散布，並得於必要時，扣押之。</p>
<p>前項出版品，如為新聞紙或雜誌，並得定期停止其發行。</p>
<p>未向美購置　原子分裂器</p>
<p>問：中央社於二月二日轉載紐約訊謂：中央研究院向美採購原子分裂器，以作原子實騐之用，並謂中國有鈾礦藏，政府採取何種步驟，以研究原子能，並如何開發及統制鈾礦，部長對於鈾礦之儲量及位置能詳細見告否？</p>
<p>答：中央研究院並未採購原子分裂器，政府尚未採取何等研究原子能之重要步驟，中國鈾礦蘊藏，尚無精確調查。</p>
<p>問：擬議之政府改組計劃，宣傳部是否仍　國民黨之一部，抑將改隸於政府，部長能以詳情見告否？</p>
<p>答：宣傳部現為黨的機構，同時亦愛行政院之指導，將來改組後之政府中，是否有類似機構，尚不可知。</p>
<p>問：實施憲政之後，凡立法機構之正式會議，是否準備向人民及新聞界公開？</p>
<p>答：立法院係院長已允諸君，該院開會時，現在即可前往旁聽，諸君如有願往者，請告知本部外事科接洽。</p>
<p>問：自下中國軍隊之實力如何，能否分成陸海空三方面言之。牽制在對共衝突中者，其正在作戰及駐守防綫者，各有多少。政府估計目前共軍正規及非正規軍力共有若干？</p>
<p>答：余甚以不能致答為歉，但在目前情况之下，尚不能披露此種數字。（完）</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>中共又一荒謬聲明</h3>
<p>中共「中央」於二月一日發表荒謬聲明，其要點有二：（一）政冶協商會議為全國人民與世界列強所一政承認的中國最高的政治機構：凡在其他民主國家須經國會通過之各種重要內政外交，自應經過這一會議之同意，方能認為有效；（二）自一九四六年一月十日以後，國民政府與列強進行外交談判所成立之一切協定與諒解，凡未經政治協商會談通過者，中共在現在或將來，決不承認，並不担負任何義務云云。我們看了這一個聲明，不論在法律上與事實上，均覺得無意義可言，幼稚得十分可笑，以不值得一辦；惟研究中共發表這一個聲明所懷有的企圖，則不得不指出，這是中共企圖武力割據的又一證明。　　我們最覺得詫異的，就是中共竟將政治協商會視為我國最高的政漢機構。關於這一點，本報社論對於政治協商會的性質，會一再指出，這俑俑是一種解決黨派糾紛的政治措施，是一種各方交換意見互相　得共同結論的政治性的會議；而絕不是代表民意的機構，更不是我國最高的政治機構。怎能與其他民主國家的國會相提並論呢？此其一。國民政府為全國人民與世界列強所一致承認的唯一的合法政府，其與列強進行談判，因而成立協定或簽訂條約，只要經過合法的手續辦理之後，就可以發生效力，凡為黃帝的子孫，均担負條約所規定的義務，中共發表這種聲明，幾乎要令人懷疑，中共已不是中華民國的人民所組織的政黨。我們必須提醒朝野上下，今天中國只有一個合法政府，那就是國民政府，今後無論國民政府如何改組，在憲法尚未實施之前，中國猶在三民主義革命建國的過程之中，也就是說，尚在國民黨的訓政時期。其與列強所締結的任何條約，只要依照現行法律所規定的手續辦理，就能發生效力。中國人民及任何政黨，均無拒不承認或不担負條約義務的理由。此其二。</p>
<p>中共對於上述二點，並非不明暸，但是為什麼要挖空心思來愚弄人民呢？其理由至為明顯。緣自美國宜佈放棄調處工作並將美軍撤退回國以後，中共即沾詁自喜，認為其反美宣傳還動已告成功，今後對於國民政府，除一方面在軍事上加緊攻勢而外，另一方面在宣傳上另找新題材，以混淆國際視聽為手段，企圖獲得列強承認中共為獨立的交戰團體，藉以削弱國民政府在國際上的地位與聲譽，從而引起國際的干涉。這真是一個慘不忍言的「苦肉計」，中共只知一黨一己的利益，竟不惜將國家與民族置於死地，怎能擭得全國人民的同情與擁護？所以我們不僅為中國的前途憂慮，而且也替中共的將來可惜。</p>
<p>據本報五日南京電，某　威會聞外人方面所得確實情報，謂中共「中央」已密令國民政府所管轄區內之各地中共黨員，假手其外圍灰色份子，鼓動風潮，甚至還要發動暴動，以行動來加強反美宣傳，聞中共已將十一月四日中美商約簽訂之日期，定為中國新的「國恥日」。從這一個新聞看來，司知中共「中央」發表這個聲明，實在包藏着極大的禍心。從這些蛛絲馬跡，不難找出一條綫索來，證明中共的用心，實在太毒辣了。目前中共所有的行動無一不是裝腔作勢，企風威脅美國，迫令美國完全退出中國；同時又在國際土恣意宣傳，以便削弱中國國民政府的地位，從而引起國際干涉中國的內爭：但是這個詭計能否達到其目的？我們敢大胆地說，中外對於中共所採取的一貫的手法，都看得非常清楚。決不會中其奸計，所以各方面對於中共二月一日所發表的聲明，並不重視。只覺得幼積可笑而已。</p>
<p>要之，國內時局發展到這種地步，身為國家主人的老百姓，僅僅表示痛心疾首，或空口呼籲和平，已絕對不足以挽回狂瀾；我們老百姓雖然都是無拳無勇的善良人民，但事到如今，再也不能不站起來，對於甘心破壞國家聲譽與地位的政黨，作嚴正的表示，絕不能再容忍其信口雌黃了。我們只知道今日中國僅有一個合法政府，凡為其依照合法手續與列強所簽訂的條約，一律有效：我們只盼望國民政府早日改組，擴大基礎，增加民主氣氛，忽因中共的橫加阻撓而延緩，以致貽害國家大局。此外，我們還要警告全國朝野上下，切不可再誤墜於中共斷送國家和平統一的陷　之中。</p>
<h3>外匯的補助與附加</h3>
<p>昨日國防最高委員會議決：政府為鼓勵輸出，對出口貨品結匯，將就其輸出價格，給予百分之一百之補助費，並對於進口貨而指定種類，徵收從價百分之五十附加費。意思就是說：出口匯率為六·七〇〇元，一部份進口匯率為五·〇二五元，其餘部份，仍為三·三五〇元。也就是說：外匯並未變更，不過全郃的出口貨，與部分的進口貨，將以補助與附加的方式，給與不同的匯率，這匯率並且已提高五成乃至一倍了。這事的得失如何，可從兩方面觀察。</p>
<p>（一）調整的時期關於調整外匯的謠言，當局不斷地在辨正，前昨兩日，尚有　謠的新聞。不意津貼與附加的辦法，昨忽突然決定，並定於今日起即行實施，這於政府的威信上，似不無可以議論之處。不過　者自關，謠者自謠，市塲上的投機播弄，興風作浪，並不因　謠而終止。甚或指東話西，相傳伯有，反使謠風愈熾。則當局的當機立斷，迅予決定，未嘗不是賢明的辦法。因為及時決定，至少可以澄清空氣，使市場上收到穩定之效。</p>
<p>（二）調整的程度昨日美鈔黑市，已經高到九千五百元，今出口匯率，政府允補貼百分之百，實際還不過六千七百元，這在出口商看來，當然未能認為完全滿意。此後各地僑匯，能否因此悉數歸公，不再逃避，也依然是問題。</p>
<p>至於一部份的進口貨物，在實施附加辦法後，其成本因而加重，其競爭力自然要削弱，對於國產品的行銷當可給與不少的助力。不過我們知道：要推廣輸出，除掉其他的條件不計，總要使此項物價，在國外市塲上，至少可與他國貨價相等。才可與人競爭。又為限制外貨起見，除掉其他的條件不計，也要使此項物價，在國內市塲，不至低過國產，方不至發生傾銷的現象。換句話說：出口貨價太高，進口貨價太低，始終無從推銷國賞，防禦外貨。所以不談貿易政策則已，如果確須鼓勸輸出，節制輸入，則對於補助與附加的程率，不應單獨主觀來決定，而應從國外與國內市塲上的物價來做伸縮的標準。舉一個例子，譬如某項出口貨，在國外市價為外幣十萬。而其成本却須十二萬，在此種情勢下，當然無法與人競爭。今如在匯價上與以補助，必須補助到可以減低其售價至十萬或十萬以下，方可達到預期之目的。倘或補助的數目太少，其成本仍須在十萬以上，則此出口商仍須虧本，其出口貨，依舊無法推動。進口貨亦然。如用附加辦法，來限制其傾銷，其附加費，必須增高至無從廉價競爭，即其售價，至少須與國貨市價相等，方可沖銷其傾銷的力量。所以補助一倍與附加五成這個數目是否相宜，還須待事實證明。</p>
<p>現在美國物價，已有低落的傾向，而吾國物價，仍在逐步上漲中。假如此種情勢，未能轉變，則外匯上所得的補助，仍將為此物價差額所抵銷，這一點，亦不可不加以深切注意的。</p>
<p>每逢外匯調整一次，法幣價值，即貶低一次，這在國際貿上，雖自有其必要的理由，但於國幣的信用上，終不無遺憾。而且幣值愈低落，儲蓄愈薄弱，投機囤積的心思愈濃，一般物價的波動也愈劇。其影饗所及，則薪工階級愈不安定，工商會計態無把握，而公家也無從平衡其收支。簡單地說：整個的國民經濟，皆將為此不安定的匯率所牽動。所以對於這一次的變相調整，在國際貿易的觀點上，我們雖寄以深切的同情。但對於外匯與幣值的安定，我們更具有熱切的期望。</p>

<h3>行總發表書面報告　說明聯總供我物資數量　及行總分配物資之情形</h3>
<p>〔本市訊〕行總發言人頃發表書面報吿，說明聯總供我物資之數量，及去年度（卅五年）行總分配物資之情形。據稱：「聯總核定對於中國之全部預算爲六四七，五〇〇，〇〇〇美元。其中五三五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元爲各種善救物資，餘一一二，五〇〇，〇〇〇美元爲運輸物資來華之海洋運費。在聯總供華物資之分類預算中，工業及交通器材佔首位，爲一七四，五〇〇，〇〇〇美元；糧食類次之，爲一三三，五〇〇，〇〇〇美元，衣着類又次之，爲九五，九〇〇，〇〇〇美元；農業器材再次之，爲八六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元；醫藥器材佔末位，爲三九，七〇〇，〇〇〇美元。餘尙有五，四〇〇，〇〇〇美元爲準備金。去年（卅五年度）已運來中國之物資的爲三一五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，故今年內尙有二一七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元之物資機續運來中國。</p>
<p>在接受職總援助之各國中，中國所獲物資最多。吾人誠感謝聯合國家人民給予戰後中國之援助，但中國幅員廣大，人口衆多，八年受災奇重，以五億餘元之物資投於中國，仍無異杯水車薪。聯總物資之分配限於曾受戰災之收復各省。如以收復各省三億人口計算，每人平均獲益僅一元七角美金。事實上收復區人民自非人人皆需救濟，且大部善後物資用於公共事業，並非發給任何私人，但一元七角之平均數足以表示聯總供我之物資數量有限。一九四四年美國之戰費平均每天消耗二九〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，聯總供給中國五億三千五百萬美元物資，尙不及美國兩天之戰費。吾人並非不滿聯總之供應數量，聯總之力量止於此，已對中國作最大之供獻。惟盼收復區各地人士注意聯總供我物資之實際數量，進而明瞭物資不敷分配之基本原因。</p>
<p>聯總供我物資，就分配而言雖屬有限，但就運輸，裝配，處理而言，則甚爲繁重。</p>
<p>自行總業務開始至去年十二月廿八日止，行總共收到聯總物資（指經正式移父者）一，三四八，五八六噸。威中糧食類佔百分之六十，交通器材佔百分之十一，衣着類佔百分之九，農業器材佔百分之四，工業器材佔百分之二，醫藥器材佔百分之一，餘爲各種雜類物資。上述物資中，於十二月廿八日以前運達各分署者計六五一，〇〇〇噸。其地區分佈如下：</p>
<p>湖南　一二六·三一六·八八噸</p>
<p>浙江　二〇·六一六·六二噸</p>
<p>上海　二八·七二一·九五噸</p>
<p>晋察綏　一五·一五四·五三噸</p>
<p>河北　三一·五四四·八〇噸</p>
<p>福建　一七·二八〇·八一噸</p>
<p>山東　二一·九〇〇·〇七噸</p>
<p>東北九省　一六·〇二〇·八六噸</p>
<p>河南　五三·二三八·三五噸</p>
<p>安微　二八·七一〇·五九噸</p>
<p>廣東　六二·九一〇·〇五噸</p>
<p>台灣　四五·二二四·〇四噸</p>
<p>湖北　三八·一四五·〇五噸</p>
<p>江西　二五·五三二·八五噸</p>
<p>江蘇南京　五七·九一九·八八噸</p>
<p>廣西　六一·六八三·四六噸</p>
<p>湖南因災情最重，配得資較多。其次爲河南，廣東，廣西三省。東北因地方秩序未恢復，交通被破壞，運往物資最少。</p>
<p>除運往各地分署者外，在去年十二月廿八以前，由行總移交政府有關各部會署（如交通部各鐵路局等）及發給行總附屬機構之器材（如行總公路大隊，水運大隊及機器廠等），計二三〇，〇〇〇噸。十二月廿八日以前在滬港兩地倉庫中未經運往內地之物資僅約九萬噸，餘則在當時之運輸途中。</p>
<p>去年收到聯總物資之總數中，約有廿一萬噸各種物資，經行總出售與各公私國體。此種出售係根據國府與聯總所訂之基本協定，售得款項悉充救濟經費，世界上接受聯總援助之國家，均與聯總訂有條約，出售其一部份物資作爲救濟經費。中國興聯總所訂之條約，亦有類似之規定。」</p>

<h3>美代表向安理會　提裁軍所衷方案　主張優先討論原子管制　蘇代表葛羅米柯表異議展開激辨</h3>
<p>〔路透社紐約成功湖四日電〕美代表奧斯汀今日在安理會中提出折衷方案，以調和美蘇兩國關於裁軍案之意見。美國之方案爲：（一）設立裁軍委會；（二）設立特別委員會以研究裁軍委會所提之建議；（三）下次會議開始時，應考慮原子能委會之報吿。奧斯汀並曰，美國受國際集體安全原則之束縛，故美國當堅持在任何裁軍計劃內，應首先計及實際安全之計劃。聯合國會員在履行裁軍義務之前，必須先獲保證，使此項實際安全計劃得以有效施行。美政府深信，國際管制原子能，包括制裁違背管制者之規定等，爲確立國際和平與安全，限制並裁减其他武器之　本條件。美國在第一次大戰後，已獲單獨裁軍之痛苦經騐，故此次已決定不再蹈覆轍。蘇代表葛羅米柯就美國之新建議提出答覆稱，蘇聯於去年十二月即已建議設裁軍委會，故美國建議之第一項並不新穎，至於第二項建議亦覺無此必要。聯合國大會已有關於該委會工作計劃之規定，故再設特委會，恐將反而遲延裁軍委會之工作。再就其第三項言，亦覺無此必要，良以原子能委會報吿，已列入安理會議程之內，自能依次討論也。至於美國表示在未有有效保證以前，未便實行裁軍一點，則誠不禁令人懷疑美國之是否信任聯合國機構及其憲章之規定。若憲章規定不足以保障安全，則聯合機構之基礎根本有悮，然則吾人即常重建聯合國機構云。</p>
<h3>組織五國小組會　負責草裁軍法規　我對美建議完全表贊同</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約成功湖四日電〕安理會中國代表郭泰祺，對於美代表所提出之決議案，即主張設立裁軍委會，及定期討論原子能委會報吿書一案，表示贊同，並謂中國代表團將以全力爲其後盾。澳洲代表赫斯勒克亦發表演說稱，澳洲對於裁軍問題，平已提出決議草案，而今美代表提議優先討論原子能問題，致延緩裁軍問題之討論，澳代表團對此實不敢苟同，美代表提議設立特委會，亦屬多此一舉，本人對於蘇代表葛羅米柯所言，甚表贊同，茲提議組織一委員會，負責起草一項聯合議案，旨在使安理會趨於一致。英代表賈德幹對於美代表所提組織特委會一議，表示附議。最後美代表奧斯汀提議，由美·蘇·法·澳及哥倫比亞五國，組織委員會，依照澳洲之建議，負責起草一項聯合議案。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社成功湖五日電〕安理會五國起草委會即將開會，討論裁軍委會之法規。目前顯有兩大趨勢，第一，倘若引起嚴重問題時，美蘇兩國均無意採用否決權，此點爲未來談判樂觀因素，殆無疑義。第二，參加談判各代表當成立關於軍隊之協定，交由安理會採納以保持和平。截至目前爲止，美蘇兩國對於此點，尙保守緘默。</p>

<h3>火案再偵訊盤詰七小時　災戶鄭載堅等均應傳到案　庭諭區隊長李壎交保</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火案，地檢處積極偵查，昨晨九時傳訊被害災戶王雲甫之女王垂琴子王垂礽，及金鄭雪鄉，　　堅，局金舫·一度被扣之消防區隊長李壎，消防負吳亦永，朱慶滙亦一併受訓。同時在押之涉嫌消防員黃賓琪，尙志魁，戴榮先，李成鈞，蔡志英亦提庭質訊。承辦檢察官沈祖壽九時正蒞庭。即開始隔別訊問。首先偵訊李壎，沈檢察官採用繁複式訊問，反覆循璨轉輾盤詰，使被訊者於不知不覺中吐露眞相，或露出破綻，故頗費時。審訊至中午，尙僅間過李壎與吳亦永二人。中午十二時略事休息，沈檢察官匆匆進餐畢，即繼續開庭。被傳各災戶將當日受災情形，侭量向檢察官供述後，再提在押五消防員嚴密偵訊，舉凡趁火打刦，勒索金條，灌救不力，刦取日光燈及毛巾，棉毛衫等雜物，王雲甫家損失金條飾物，王家衣櫥被劈，橡皮水管壓置瓦磔堆中，美軍如何協助救火等等問題，人證物證以及時間上關係，莫不詳細訊問。偵訊連續進行七小時，至下午四時始竣事，除原在押之五消防員仍還押外，昨傳各人中僅李壎一人論交保。其餘諸人皆飭回。　左圖爲被傳審之吳亦永（前）朱慶潤（後）（本報攝）</p>

<h3>消防處長訴苦　工具缺經費少　困難不一而足</h3>
<p>素質低落由於生活不安定</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕西摩路大火案發生後，質難四起，對於延燒與大火熄而復燃之原因，及任其燃燒十三小時之理由等，疑點頗多。警局方面對於處理此案經過之報吿，始終未見公佈。火災調查委員會特於昨日上午十一時，假市府會議室，召集各報記者，請消防處長周兆祥出席報吿。消防處科長王文濤，葉斌勇，謝智肅等，對於當天火災之處理，延燒之原因，出永情形各點，均有詳細之報吿，對於消防員失職方面亦有所解釋。</p>
<p>周　處長首稱：此次西摩路大火發生後，使人民損失慘重，目勞與論界之關切，從事消防工作者抱愧異常。消防設施欲求其健全，這在上海委實很困難。目前，違法建築物如此之多，所以易起火災，道路狹窄而車輛擁擠，致救火車輛駛行費時，且平日之水壓過低，故不足以救火，加以水龍缺乏，不敷匯用，依上海人口四百餘萬計算，需要消防分區四十三處，水龍一萬三千隻，救火車二百餘輛。而木市現有消防處計九區，全市水龍僅三千餘隻，救火車三十五輛，面水帶更糟，能負担八十磅壓力有，不足全數五分之一。抗戰八年來，消防設施祗有消耗，沒有增添，其破壞之程度，由此可見。</p>
<p>關　於消防員之品格方面，本人認爲必須有特別高尚之品格，始有資格担任消防工作。過表消防員待遇好，生活優　，談骨氣自容易。而目前待遇　　，（現時消防員之待遇普涌　十四莫元左右）生活不安定之　果，遂使消防員素質逐漸低落，但無論如何，統計去年一年來　〇六三次火警中，自問尙無愧　國家之處。</p>
<p>關　於經費方面，照參議會所通過的數額爲十億元，而實際上接獲市府通知書僅五億，且猶未領到。第一項由敵僞產業項下撥下之五億元，已於去年十一月間向美國訂購水帶九萬九千呎，高壓帶浦車二輛及消防零件等，的須於五月間可到達。因爲消防工具必須抑給於國外，加以經費又如此拮据，因此對於現有之舊物，不得不愼爲保養，而消防員在這一方面之功續，亦不能抹殺。美軍的皮帶，用後從來不洗，第二次可以再換一根，而我們的皮帶，是八九年沿用下來的，非用一次洗一次不可。</p>
<p>周　處長又强調說：目前消防員的工作情緒非常差，九個區隊的分隊長，沒有一個不想逃走。</p>
<p>奮工部局時代，每個消防員可得消防服一套，皮　一頂，膠靴一雙，制帽（連帽徽）一項，單大衣一件，皮腰帶一條，斧頭一，皮靴一雙，跑鞋一雙，工作服二件，扭扣二十一顆，號碼五付，白襯衫及白褲各一，衣箱一隻。現時之消防員所有者，雖數量上與昔日火同小異，而質料相差極大，均係數年來之舊物，故衣服上之補綴甚多。</p>
<h3>大火之夜氣候寒冷　影響施救工作</h3>
<p>西摩路大火案發生後，消防處已向氣象合，水電公司，各區隊加以詳細調查，昨作綜合報吿如下：根據天文台之記錄，大火之夜，氣候極爲寒冷，當晚九時之溫度爲攝氏十五度，至夜半即降至零度。氣候之寒冷，亦實足以影響施救工作，根據美國防禦協曾之手册中刊載，前年美國發生之火災一六三次中，天氣寒冷實佔其中之大多數。</p>
<p>據水電公司之統計，當日之用水量爲九十一萬五千八百加侖，　州路上之水壓，最抵爲十七磅，最高爲二十一磅。水電公司於十一時二十五分接獲通知後，即將水壓增至四十磅。按常例，水壓在三十磅者，放水可達六十呎，灌救王層建築物當無問題。然當時火已燎原，控制遂發生困難矣。</p>
<p>水龍絕無損壞</p>
<p>又據消防處之統計，當日火塲附近之水龍絕無損壞，美軍所稱完全不確，臨近之冰　所以不用者·乃在於保養器材·因爲武定路之水龍，貼近火塲，救火車可能發生危險。又陝西北路（即西摩路）新閘路北之二水龍（一二四六號及一二四五號）式樣過舊，口徑寬僅二吋半，而消防處使用之吸水管闊五吋，故不能應用。此外，由於地下水管之供應量有限，故兩旁之水龍使用後，位於中間者即吿無效。</p>
<p>按照消防處向例，凡普通火警發生時，出動之消防車爲數僅一輛，凡廠房，旅館，戲院失火，或由瞭望台報吿火警時，則出動二輛。至於是否須繼續增援，則有待於第一輛車之報吿。此次西摩路火災，因火勢猛烈，故各區隊均有救火車到塲，計爲九輛。消防處對於各車汽油供應狀况及打水情形，均有正確之記錄。經調查後，每輛車均曾向區隊部要求加油，除四六號車未用外，其他車輛打水至少歷四小時以上。</p>
<p>與工部局時代比較</p>
<p>若就現時消防嚴備與工部局時代作比較，則在其所佔之經費上可觀其大概。前工部局時代之火政處經費佔全部行政經費之百分之四至五。現時之消防經費僅佔百分之零點五。人數方面，尙無大差別，前英租界火政處共有官佐八三名，長警六五八名，法租界共有官佐十名，長警二〇〇名，現警局消防處共有官佐四三名，再加消防總隊六二名，已較前工部局時代多十二名。長警人數共計七九七名，較前少五十名。</p>
<h3>貝當公寓房客呼籲　屋歸政院應用　當局令月底遷讓</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕木市房屋糾紛層出不窮，最近衡山路七百號貝當公寓居戶，因受中央信託局敵僞產業清理處勒迫遷讓，特延陳霆銳律師向行政院，市政府，市參議會，中信局等呼籲，據稱：該處房屋原係敵產，爲德僑所有，租戶七家，寄居有年，勝利後產權由我政府接收，所有房客仍照常居住，房租由中信局地產處按月收取。三月前中信局有函致全體房客，略謂此一公寓即將標賣，如房客有意承購，可來局投標。全體房客鑒於上海房荒嚴重，經會議後，即復函願意承購，並請給予優先權，當由中信局復函待決定標買時來函通知。詎意上月三十日，忽有穿武裝者四人，持敵產淸理處公函，謂該公寓奉令歸行政院應用，限月底遷讓，否則當由主管當局勒遷云云，全體房客以當局如此處理，未免出爾反爾，決據理力爭。</p>
<h3>普陀江寗新成區　三區長先後選出</h3>

<p>江寗區民選區長亦於昨日舉行，吳忠達以三十五票當選爲正區長，周浩銘以三十票當選爲副區長。</p>
<p>第十一區新成區於四日假育才中學競選區長，結果王劍鍔以一〇七票當選區長，陳瑜以九十一票當選副區長。惟王劍勞爲本市之參議員，內政部原規定委派之區長不得兼任參議員，現王劍鍔爲民選之區長，可否兼任參議員一事，尙成問題，民政處擬呈請內政部解釋。</p>

<h3>姑娘愛俏創巨痛深　乳部發炎開刀九次　追源禍始控告醫生</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕寗波女子　秀弘，年二十八歲，家住長寗路三十七弄三十三號，生性愛美，常怨乳部不够發達，乃於去年九月二日赴靜安寺路五八七弄二〇五號石氏　整形院就醫，院主石霜湖　　注射針藥，當能增進綫條美，　　泱心「整形」，預付針藥費黃金二爾，由石打針醫治。不料一週後，忽發現乳部發炎，至九月廿日仍炎　不退，石霜湖謂必需開刀，一次無效，二次再開，如此一而再，再而三，至十月底先後共開刀六次，石則於十月卅日離滬赴港。鄭女因恥於另行求治，繼續由石氏整形院之女助手醫治，文連續開刀三次，九次開刀，非唯不能痊愈，病勢反形嚴重。於十一月二十三日改往公利醫院求治，經試行電療亦未見效。該院醫師診斷結果，認爲非大閒刀難於康復，經鄭女同意復，遂於十二月十一日再動手術，至今仍在院你　中，鄭女浦定思痛，乃問警局控吿石霜湖，經警局傳石偵訊後，於昨日將該案移送地檢處。</p>
<h3>大火延燒原因爲何不拆木棚　處長一一答覆</h3>
<p>消防處周處長報吿完畢後，火災調查委員會主委葛克信當詢以大火延燒之原因何在？當廿九號未起火時，消防員是否可將王家東邊之不棚拆卸，以謀隔離？周處長答稱：根據各官佐數十年經騐，火勢係藉廿九號二樓窗口延人至二樸天花板上，即二三樓之夾層中，當火勢在平頂中醞釀時，自難發覺。且自木棚熄滅後，即未有消防員人內觀察，王家宅主亦均已離屋，此可由二點證明：（一）二樓佣人之佳居已被燒壞，（二）三樓外面未焚燒，內裏已燒壞。面火勢不能控制之原因，爲該等洋房，造自民國前五年，據工部局之報吿，該屋雖有風火牆，然木質之屋架均自風火牆中洞穿，且據消防處第一科工程專家研究結果，縱續屋項之木架極多，經歷四十年，乾燥異常，故當火勢穿人屋頂後，延燒極易，西摩路八幢洋房共長二〇〇呎，其全部延燒時間，據報吿爲時僅二小時。</p>
<p>至於爲何不將廿九號之附屬建築物木棚拆卸，周處長之回答爲：一個火塲指揮官蒞塲後，須面面俱到，事實亦有所困難，且欲將王宅之木棚拉坍，至少亦須二三十人，則當時人手不够。後木棚一度曾熄滅，雖關經區隊長朱慶瀾八廿九號觀看，因發現屋內無主，即返身引退，對於延燒一點，事前未予密切注意。</p>
<p>葛主委當吿周處長，謂根據調委會調查結果，當廿九號未延燒前，即巳有消防員數人在宅內，此輩八廿九號所爲何事？若謂任務爲觀察火勢是否延燒，而結果毫無發現，聽其延燒，則此數人應負最大之責任。周處長當點頭稱是，並謂將加以密查。</p>
<p>又周處長說明嚴格計算火災時間之標準，乃自接到警報時起，至火勢控制後爲止，其他如消防處未接警報，及已經控制後之餘火均不應計算在內，故此項大火，正確算來，爲時僅四小時，而若將餘火包括在內，則達二十小時。</p>

<h3>發掘火塲昨日開始　王雲甫曠達　燒了也就算</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕發掘五家火塲工作，已自昨午二時起開始，王雲甫及其小姐王垂琴（文英）均親自臨塲監督。發掘工作由警局督察處長張達領導，並督察巡官徐光，區民代表劉精儒，保長蔡國棎及江寗區分局林巡官並隨帶警士三人，赴火塲監督。同時蔡保長雇用小工七人，先就王家客應及火少奶奶臥房室坍下部分先行挖掘。因發掘工作自昨日開始，所做僅爲浮面工作，故至昨午六時爲止，尙無重要證物發現。經掘得者有火爐鐵欄架二隻，屋架洋單鐵一塊，樟木籍鉸鏈一，箱子搭禁二，及鐵鎖一具，此外如無綫電另件，電影放映機另件，瓦楞鐵皮等均有發現，所有掘得之物，已經開具名單交王氏過目。</p>

<h3>獻金購機支持敵國侵略戰　孫田昌植難缷罪責　軍事法庭以戰犯罪提公訴</h3>
<p>韓人孫由昌植一案，係機械技術出身，在滬創設精密機械工藝社，卅三年十月間，由敵軍部指爲乙種軍指定工廠，並有代敵收買各種硬幣，製造軍火，在屋頂架設高射砲，向敵軍呈獻飛機等罪嫌，經檢舉後，數經偵訊，交保在案。茲據記者控悉，孫田昌楨通敵罪嫌業已確立，業經軍事法庭檢察官屠　鈞正式提起公訴。茲誌其起訴書全文於後：</p>
<p>被告孫田昌植，男，年四十二歲，韓國藉，住上海貝常路九二九號。被告因戰犯嫌疑一案，（三十五年戰偵字第一六二號），經本軍法檢察官偵查完畢，認爲應行提起公訴，茲將犯罪事實證及所犯法條開列如左：</p>
<p>被告出身技工</p>
<p>被告孫田昌植，係檄械技術出身，在滬創設精密機械工藝社，製造車床銑床等工業機器，擁有男女工人七十七人。敵軍佔領滬市後，曾於三十三年十月間，由敵軍部指爲乙種軍指定工廠，令其製造小銑床帮浦等。勝利後，由蘇浙皖區敵僞產業處理局沒收，撥歸國有在案。被告於日寇投降後，仍居原址，工廠則停止工作。</p>
<p>發現可疑物件</p>
<p>三十五年五月二十八日，淞滬警備司令部奉令勒遷哈同大樓韓僑，於被吿之陳列所內，發現望遠鏡八架，小型照相機六架，疑有軍用關係，遂將被吿傳部偵訊。偵查以後，該部認爲案屬普通刑事，於同年七月十一日，移送上海地方檢察處偵查。被吿經諭交書面保一千萬元，釋放在外。三十四年十月間，曾有市民周韓浦，韓凱元，周慶榮三人，以被吿有向敵獻機，包修金陵兵工廠全部機械，佔用英商謀得利琴行總廠，曾爲敵收買各種硬幣，以供敵軍製造軍火之用，並在屋頂上架設高射砲等罪嫌，向前軍統局檢舉。十二月二十三日，由該局參謀梁銘坊，會同檢舉人，將被吿西摩路一三五零號會庫內，及貝當路九二九號住宅內相當數量之物資，加以查封。三十五年五月四日，蘇浙皖區敵僞產業處理局，以滬字三字二五五六七號批，及經濟部蘇浙皖區特派員辦公處通知法字第一零九零六號，除日人定貨應沒收外，上項被扣物資，廠產，均經發還被吿在案。</p>
<p>檢舉人再檢舉</p>
<p>檢舉人不服上項處分，復於三十五年八月二十一日，具狀向上海高等法院檢察處檢舉，請治以漢奸之罪。嗣該處以奉司法部京捐字三字一一零六八號指令，原屬日本之朝鮮人，以敵人論，遂於三十五年十月二十一日，轉解本庭依法偵查。</p>
<p>難缷戰爭罪責</p>
<p>查檢舉人周榮慶等與被吿素不相識，就其所檢舉之事項言之歷歷。該工藝社工人胡成根亦在高檢處爲不利被吿之供證，顯有相當罪嫌。訊據被吿，對於向敵獻機一節，經供認曾繳四十萬元，由敵充購械之用，對於胡成根則稱爲開革之工人，積有怨嫌，並以檢舉人所舉其他之證人諸榮芳，黃梅璋，陳君秋，宋根甫，季杏根等之證言，於被吿並無不利，故對於其餘各項，概不承認。但即就被告向敵獻金充作購機之用一端，顯係爲敵支持對我國侵略戰爭之行爲，要難解卸戰爭罪責。</p>

<h3>出口結匯補助辦法決定後　金鈔漲勢已漸疲弱</h3>
<p>銀根鬆濫買戶心思浮動</p>
<p>烚赤昨初抵　高，再創新高價，實力派乘貝氏離申之隙，再加　動，晨開四七〇萬至四七二萬，浮多有舊，曾回跌至四六三萬抵價，買戶逢低維持，始轉平穩，不久復穿出四七〇萬外，於是人心又起恐慌，實力派從中鼓動，遂直升至四八五萬，始有脫手者，並因配給時間關係，而告回落，央行以四八〇萬之價，配出一七〇〇條，低價忽退至四七四萬，無何買風再起，浮空被軋，　碼甚涸，再起暴漲，高價達四九五萬，始告轉盤，午刻退入四九〇萬內。午後即交已回低至四八二萬，隔日交割會回升至四九三萬，後傳國防會議通過輸出品結匯補助辦法已經決定，美滙不過折合六千七，多方紛加了結，而退至四七三萬，結果較前收尚漲三萬，飾金掛五十萬元，銀元微升，暗拆銀根　濫，息價自一角三至一角六不等。</p>
<p>外幣盬金潮再昂，美鈔暗擊自晨初之八千六至八千八起，近午盤漲至九千五高價，而後略　，午後傳美滙折合不過六千七，買戶成感失望，最後退至九千元左右，結果較前收仍漲三百元，港票追隨於後，高價達一八五〇元左右，而後亦回。結果較前收漲七十元，港滙升至一八〇〇元，印滙二一九〇元，英滙二八八〇〇元，均屬求過於供，成交反少。</p>
<h3>米價已告鬆動　不久可復正常　雜糧油餅仍堅俏</h3>

<h3>人造絲續漲　貫貨益見俏利</h3>
<p>人造絲昨市仍形堅昂，一二〇號高山有光上午最大做四十萬元，最小喊過一十八萬元，下午做三十八萬元，結果比上日大起二十萬元弱，廠經交易仍淸，惟高勻度價較俏，昨做開C字等級做價五百七十五萬元，D字等級高檔喊七十萬元，次者喊六十萬元，較上日大二十萬元，普通貨喊大十萬元，干經乏成交，價稍形軟弱，綢貨昨市更俏，因業外人不乏搜購，美亞被面竟喊六十五萬元，比上日漲二十五萬元，格子豐縐又大一千元，華中　上午喊三千九百元。但下午四千元無貨，其他各貨均頗堅挺。</p>

<h3>程其保考察歸來　談東北敎育情形　昨在敎部招待首都記者</h3>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕教部前派東北敎育考察團程其保（敎部敎育研究委員會委員），周或文（訓育委員會副主任），孫愛棠，蔡若水（均是部督學），一行四人，於上年十一月二十日出發考察，爲期兩個半月，日前回京，向敎部復命。本報記者專訪程其保委員，談考察東北敎育情形，承吿槪要於下：</p>
<p>一般情形</p>
<p>東北有九省二市，此次考察僅就已收復西省，交通要點，考察所及，如瀋陽，四平街，長春，永吉，安東，錦州，撫順等地。論其敎育情形，復員尙稱順利，惟敵偽時之學校編制與課程及敎材等等情形不同，謀與現制銜接調整，甚感困難。學生程度較差，因以前國文不注重，無英文及公民，史地，思想錯誤。上述種種，現正在謀調整改良解決中。所幸敎職員，雖在淪陷期多年，皆能保持固有精神，未受惡勢力改變其堅定之意志。而一般中學靑年學生，富於情感，關懷祖國之熱烈情緒，極其濃厚，隨時有所表現，於求知慾尤爲深切，其體質健壯，自治能力富强，均爲好現象，但因受敵僞壓迫多年，一切行動思想，被統制不自由者已久，今一旦光復解放，咸莫知所從，此在我負敎育責任者，應啓示途徑，爲良善之指導。以一般學校情形言，無論大學中學小學，其師資人才，均感缺乏，需要大量的補充，希望內地有志靑年，能往東北，協力輔助敎育之進行，則東北以其原有之良好素質，亦不難逐漸恢復原狀，又學校設備，在戰時損壞過甚，圖書儀器，皆形奇缺，學生上課，頗多席地而坐，甚望中央大量的撥助經費救濟，以充實其設備。</p>
<p>高敎槪况</p>
<p>原有之東北大學已復校。瀋陽醫學院，設備充實，規模宏大，爲全國之冠，惟敎授人才未能調整，現尙有日籍敎師四十餘人。此外在長春設有長春大學，永吉設有長白師範學院。敎部計劃俟哈爾濱一旦收復，即成立濱江大學。按東北敎育情形，尙需要設立許多學院與專科學校，尤其是專科學校，更應多設，以培養技術人才，供應地方新建設之需求，因現在技術人才缺乏，尚有日本技術人員數千人留職，未能補充，以撫順煤礦而論，有二千多日籍人員留職，資源委員會亦正在計畫謀訓練技術人才，以資補充。</p>
<p>中小敎育</p>
<p>中學敎育，比九一八以前，學校校數，與學生人數，均較增加，有加至一倍以上者不等，惟程度低落，應設法提高。國民學校，因有些地方不安定者，復員比較困難，但一般情形還好，大都可能繼續復學，據査失學兒童數，約佔百分之六十左右，故國民敎育，亟應積極推動。</p>
<p>社敎近狀</p>
<p>因復負伊始關係，尙未盡量開展。原有潘陽岡書館已恢復，近與博物館合併爲國立瀋陽博物院，分圖書博物兩部。東北目前文化食糧，最感缺乏，甚盼中央大量運輸供應各種刋物，電化敎育之器材，尤感需要。</p>
<p>設置臨大</p>
<p>東北收復時，設有臨時大學一校，學生之來源，爲敵僞時之國高學生與專修科學生二千人，及從日本回國之留學生，經訓練一年後，已分發於東北各大學續學。</p>
<p>招撫流亡</p>
<p>爲救濟從匪區逃出之失學青年，在長春設立聯立中學，開辦已逾半年，學生巳有三千人，現在從黑龍江哈爾濱等地逃出前往人學者，日有所聞。</p>
<p>〔本報南京五日電〕東北敎育考察團程其保等，今日下午在敎部招待記者，報吿考察東北敎育情形。</p>

<h3>足球友誼賽一面倒　鐵路昨全勝合羣　四比零上下半時各二隻</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕鐵路對合羣，昨日下午舉行足球友誼賽於晋元公園，因不售門票，圍觀球迷達四千餘人，戰來成一面倒，鐵路淨勝四球，合羣鴨蛋一枚，上半時鐵路以二比零領先。</p>
<p>合羣於本屆足球聯賽中，成績欠佳，日前該隊重新振作，加入市長盃競賽，頗欲一露頭角，故昨日與鐵路之友誼賽，大有測騐意味，結果仍漫不成軍，竟吃鴨蛋，不勝爲其前途憂慮也。</p>
<p>鐵路全軍進攻猛烈</p>
<p>笛聲響後軍進逼，奈脚頭稍差，張傑三扣，蕭子文二擊，均無所獲，合羣門將姚崇，生意興隆，中堅錢長榮亦忙極一時。廿五分鐘時，鐵路張傑，率三軍進襲，合羣孫黄二衛，並駕阻擋，張傑將球向前挑送，姚崇躍出撲球未獲，被林典義趕來一蹴，合羣之城遂陷。全軍震憤，反攻甚急，奈乏聯絡，且鐵路後衛森嚴，均不得逞。四十分鐘時，鐵路張傑，單刀衝人合羣復地，竟又鵠中一球，前半時二比〇鐵路佔先。</p>
<p>合羣士氣益見散漫</p>
<p>易陣交鋒氣益見散漫，已無反攻之力。廿分鐘時，鐵路費春林二十碼外鵠中一球，成三此〇合羣陣地更見慘象，然鐵路諸將，毫不留情，進逼益甚。卅分鐘時，蕭子文側面進攻，姚崇稍慢，又未撲住，被林典羲冷門突出又奪一城，四比〇合羣一籌莫展。後鐵路攻勢仍未見鬆弛，時觀衆多擁擠在合羣門側，成漏斗狀，便宜了合羣，蓋鐵路旁敲側擊，已不可能也。時間旣屆，四比〇合羣慘敗予鐵路。</p>
<p>鐵路</p>
<p>寥雄</p>
<p>宋仁考　徐晟源</p>
<p>陸炳生　吳嘉邦　瞿錫根</p>
<p>蕭子文　費春林　張傑　陸慶祥　林典義</p>
<p>合羣</p>
<p>姚崇</p>
<p>孫漢文　黃振東</p>
<p>陳字俗　錢長榮　翟錫榮</p>
<p>劉志光　唐根福　劉隆興　朱成福　符貿彬</p>
<h3>籃球聯賽　春茂巨人今晚交鋒</h3>
<p>二屆籃球聯賽，今日原有三塲，女組雪白對女靑紫，甲二部甲由對鐵路滬，甲一部春茂對巨人，惟甲二部鐵路滬因球員泰半隨埠際隊赴港未返，經籃委會決定，准予改期，故今日秩序稍有更動，比賽改由下午六時半開始，首塲女組，女組雪白隊相逢女靑紫，女靑紫近况頗佳，屆時出戰雪白，抵抗必烈。</p>
<p>甲一部春茂戰巨人，前者初戰擊敗華聯，氣焰高漲，番將巨人，亦非弱者，陶勃林　，沙司金昆仲，强杜萊，耶龍等，聯絡純熟，陣容整齊，屆時兩雄相遇，定有劇烈演出。今日秩序錄復：雪白——女靑紫（女子）六時半春茂——巨人（甲一）七時半</p>

<h3>歸國見聞</h3>
<p>— 駐古巴公使　梅景周</p>
<p>民國三十五年七曰廿五日，余奉令回國述職。當時將購置船票等手續辦妥後，就在八月九日那天下午二時由珍珠港動身，計算在祖國逗留已有五閱月之久，現在將回國途中見聞及余在國內行動經過，路述如下：</p>
<p>東方輪上十華人似投向茲母懷抱</p>
<p>我們所乘的船爲「東方」海輪，同行者有華客十人，本人別離祖國已有十七個年頭了。當上船的時候，好像投向茲母的懷抱，非常愉快。尤其是在八月廿三日那天，船到了吳淞口，遠望上海全境，目睹「河山光復，故土重新」的景象，一種非言語所能形容的憶樂，油然充滿了胸中！</p>
<p>二十四日的晚上，我們的船，就在黄浦江入口處下了錨，那裹當揚子江的中流，入夜萬籟俱寂，明星燦爛，附近有十餘只汽船停着，船中洩漏出來的燈光，隨波蕩漾着，使人　然神往，一輪皓月，懸掛在空際，大有唐詩裏所說的「此生此夜不常好，明月明年何處看？」之慨！</p>
<p>舟經「國際日綫」無形中損失一天</p>
<p>二十五日，正是星期日，我們的船駛進黄浦江，我們看到兩岸的碼頭及貨棧。長達數英里，艟艨巨艦，分泊在兩旁，上海眞不愧爲我國的重要商埠。到埠後，下榻於南京路外灘的華懋飯店，華懋的房屋有九層高，俯看全上海，歷歷在目。那天晚上，應孫院長哲生之招，在他公館裏吃晚飯，回寓所已經是夜間十二時了。</p>
<p>我們的船每小時航行十三又百分之五十四海里，每日約行三百二十五海里，從動身到上海，船上共計十五天。統計這十五天的旅程中，自八月九日到十三日，風平浪靜，在甲板上遠眺，覺海天潦闊，茫無涯岸，這樣大的宇宙，個人實在比「滄海一粟」還小呢！</p>
<p>十四日那天，因爲輪船經過International　Date　Line，無形中損失了一天。十三日過後就是十五日了，原來地球由西向東旋轉着，每小時轉過十五度，所謂自轉，整個地球，恰好在廿四小時內轉完。同時，我們的船駛行的方向，却與牠轉動的方向相反，是向西的，得到了更多向太陽的機會，因此經過這條地理學家所假定的「國際日綫，」應减去一日，以得合世界上各國的日期。若是由中國到美國去，經過這條綫，就得增加一日了。</p>
<p>就在那一天，風浪突然大了起來，余頗受些「暈船」的磨難。直至十九日，才又風平浪靜，此後直到上海，沒有大風波，以上是回國旅途中的大略情形。</p>
<p>九十兩日京滬道看江南豐饒地區</p>
<p>自八月廿五日回國到九月底一個多月間，宴會酬酢，忙碌非常，凡所會見者，皆係政府要員及各界的領袖，所以對於國內的情形，瞭解得不少，在這期間內、曾到南京去一次，到姑蘇去一次。南京是爲公事去的，姑蘇是去遊玩的。俗語說：「上有天堂，下有蘇杭。」蘇州山水的秀麗，可說「罄竹難書」：虎邱泉石的淸奇，靈岩溪壑的幽秀，以梅花著名的鄧尉，都使人流連忘返。他如西園同留園，佈置非常典雅，寒山寺同滄浪亭，則古色古香，令人戀戀不忍離去。靈岩寺離開蘇州城外約有二十英里，我們到那邊，攀援到了山頂。向下看整似太湖的景色，確是一幅天然美麗的圖畫。我們知道湖絲的產量，太湖區實佔了一半，所以從山頂向下看，桑林與田畝相連接，江南確是富饒的地區啊！</p>
<p>其間還有一事値得一提：九月十日那天，已經是午夜十二時了，申報館王顯廷先生陪我去參觀申報，那時他們的編輯部及排字房等，工作正是緊張的時候，電燈　　，每人都精神抖擻地在做事，幾乎令人疑心是在白天而非深夜。査申報的歷史最長久，是清朝同治年間創刋的，銷行最廣，目下銷數，達十五餘萬份。</p>
<p>十月份裏，一號至廿二號間，光後到南京去了二次，所以除宴會　辭外，還僕僕京滬道上呢。</p>
<p>香港海岸兩小時駛進太平洋北行</p>
<p>這次在國內，曾到香港去一次，時間爲十月廿三日，同行約有李嗣領事家驤，王哲春君，及西友瑞士君等，是乘中航公司飛機去的。當時飛機在七千尺高空航行，頗有些寒意。那天十時半到了儿龍飛機塲，下榻於京都酒店·第二天，就趁安徽號輸船到了汕頭·從香港到汕頭爲一百七十四海里，要航行十六小時才到，船開行後，港灣融洩，風景宜人，山光水色，可說兼而有之。約摸過了二小時，始走完了香港海岸，進太平洋向北行駛，繞着廣東省的海岸，那裏山嶺從疊，遠遠望去很好看，習習的海風，撲面吹來，眞是旅行中的樂事。</p>
<p>香港在廣州灣外，本來是座荒島，從雅片戰爭以後，始割讓於英國，英人遂開爲自由海岸，設市於山腰裏，順着山勢的高下，列上中下三環，名曰維多利亞市，派總督來管理。所有貨物的進出，不必征稅，因此商人都到此地來做貿易，市面就繁榮起來了，現在電綫航路。四通八達，成了東亞貿易的重地。</p>
<p>香港自割讓給英國以後，在咸豐十年更訂立了北京續約，割去了對面的九龍，他們就築起砲台來，與香港成犄角之勢。光緒二十五年又開拓了九龍租界，大嶼南島等地，也相繼被攫取，香港於是有了豐滿的羽翼了。</p>
<p>「余園」數日小往亭臺樓閣在半山</p>
<p>抗戰勝利以後，人口陸續增加，約有一百五十萬人。本人在那裏的時候，正値工潮爆發，全港的華字報紙，於十一月六日起總停刊。各報排字工人，提出改善待遇的要求：（一）每天要供給膳食三餐，（二）須付住宿金，（三）每星期休息一天，報館當局認爲辦不到，因此自行停刊。同時，香港當局正發動取締無牌小阪，若實行後，要有八萬人失業呢！</p>
<p>香港的「余園」，爲已故南洋華僑巨子余東旋的產業，在半山裏，亭臺樓閣，極爲華麗。余在此住了數天。蒙余夫人殷勤款待，至可感也。至於香港仔，即鳴巴甸，在香港的背後，我們從西區薄扶林道繞山到了那裏。漁民　集，實爲香港最大的漁港。牠的地勢：西北是加列山，南面可望鴨脷洲島，東有磚窰紫羅山，西有博寮洲島，烽巒重疊，烟波浩瀚，我們循着山到淺水灣，那裏在香港的背面，是山四入的地方，不受海潮的打擊，三面環山，對面是海，環境極爲優美，日軍攻香港，就在此地登陸。</p>
<p>走私客悠然解纜不管警槍砰砰響</p>
<p>據十二月廿三日申報所載，說香港的貿易衰落，十一月份較十月份爲减少。</p>
<p>我們赴汕所趁的「安徽號」輪船，是十月廿五號早上七時半到汕頭灣的，那裏兩旁排列着小邱。進了灣，當船慢慢地前進的時候，有兩艘走私船，隨着我們的船行駛，那兩只船中有走私搭客，將貨物用繩擲下船中，我們船中的警兵放槍威嚇，他們若無其事，很悠閒地解纜而去，這種公然的走私，倒也有趣！</p>
<p>到了汕頭，在「月苑公寓」裏休息。汕頭在淸朝咸豐九年間開爲商埠，是閔南粤東及江西東南隅四十餘縣的貨物總滙處，那裏是韓江的咽喉，有險峻的懸崖，有浩漫的滄海，水流很深，所以貨物船隻的出入，極爲便利。韓江的貿易，盡滙集於此。同時，華工華商到南洋去的，都在此地經過，所以對南洋各埠的貿易也極盛旺。英，法，荷，挪威，瑞典等國，戰前在此地設有領事館，民國十一年開辦市政，一切建設，都非常有進步，華南商埠，除廣州外，要算汕頭了。現有人口十八萬八千餘人，全市外僑總數爲三十四人，總計住戶二萬七千四百九十七戶，商店三千五百五十二戶，男人十萬三千五百八十六名，女人八萬五千三百五十五名。</p>
<p>沿公路離汕赴潮千載甘棠訪韓祠</p>
<p>在汕頭玩了幾天，於二十八日早晨九時十分，同着王春哲君，沈鴻　君，駕自動車沿着潮汕公路開到潮安，就是潮州府，約費一小時半的工夫。沿途新　綠草，都在含笑迎人。潮安在潮江的下　，爲閔粤往來的要地，市區縱横，人煙極盛。我們除參觀抽絲廠外，再遊韓仙廟及韓汀橋。城東北有「意溪鎭」，一稱「惡溪」，就是韓文公（退之）做潮州刺史時爲文驅鱷魚的地方。潮州人非常感激，立祠來奉祀他，祠裏有碑寫着「千戰甘棠」四個大字。韓汀橋據說是韓湘子成仙以後所建的，在潮曾看潮州戲，演出者爲兒童，雖然幼稚點、但也別有風趣！</p>
<p>據潮州海關的統計：民國州五年，每月外洋輪船，從香港，南洋羣島等處進口的，有一百零四艘。貨物進口有一百十六萬噸。民國三十五年七，八，九，這三個月間，平均計外洋船進口約有四十二艘，貨物進口有二萬六千噸。民國廿五年每月國內各口岸，如穗，津，台灣船隻進口的，有七十一艘，貨物進口的，有十一萬噸。民國卅五年七，八，九，三個月間，平均計每月國內各口岸，如穗，洋，滬，台船隻進口的，有七十七艘，貨物一千六百噸。</p>
<p>余回國後，覺得國內同胞道德的墮落，自尊心的消失，同時生產的凋敝，社會的紊亂，在在令人鬱鬱。在汕頭常遊中山公園，把胸中的抑鬱舒洩不少。</p>
<p>返港聞端納噩耗一片友情話影事</p>
<p>我們於十一月四號趁「潮安號」回香港。十號那天，香港華字日報刊載着蔣主席前顧問端納氏噩的耗，說他在九號上午一時一刻病歿於上海宏恩醫院。余與端納感情極篤，得到此次消息，非常傷心。余自回國後，先後到醫院去看過他二次，覺他的體力日衰，極爲担心。端納逝世時，年七十一歲，他是澳洲人，僑居中國已有四十三年了。西安事變的時候，他曾竭力營救蔣主席。此次戰事中，他在菲列賓被捕，幸虧未被認出來，囚在集中營裏，備受虐待，因此患了肺痙惡疾。余觀光三藩市世界安全會議的時候，他從拉摩島移居檀島來醫病。過了數月，病勢反重，到了三月十九日才由擅島來滬，那時是董顯光先生陪同來的，不料竟病故在中國，豈不傷心—</p>
<p>澳門商業並不盛政令失修海盜多</p>
<p>十一月十一日，余從香港乘船到澳門。澳門在三角洲的南端，好像一個小半島。那邊同香港都是粤江的門戶，形勢極好，明朝嘉靖十三年的時候，葡萄牙人到此地來殖民，每年繳納租金五百兩；到了淸朝光緒十三年完成了永讓的條約，於是就淪爲異域了。市街在山麓間，因爲離香港很近，所以商業並不興旺。那裏政令不修，海盜極多，賭博是公開的，並且還有賭稅呢！</p>
<p>里青葱翠享村　國父誔辰訪故居</p>
<p>十二日那天，爲國父誕辰紀念。余與張鵬一，張燦榮，李副領事等，於八時三十分，倔自動車從澳門起程，九時半到了中山縣的翠亨，把衣冠整肅了一下，去瞻仰　國父的故居。那裏風景極好，山光景色，十里青葱，地靈人傑，才能誕生　國父那樣的偉大人物，樹千秋萬代的楷模，爲贏實人類的救主。那天，成千成萬的學生與民衆去瞻仰總理的故里，並且在故居的前面，舉行了莊嚴的紀念儀式。我們離開翠亨後，沿公路經崖口，南朗，欖邊，大環，而至石歧。縣長張惠長聞余等至，即備美酒嘉肴，表示歡迎，盛意雲崇，至足感也。</p>

<h3>關於敎科書</h3>
<p>— 危言</p>
<p>又到了開學的時節。家長們忙着籌湊子女的學費，學生忙着配購敎科畫。關於學費問題近來在被各方面熱烈的討論。辦學的人希望高一點，家長們希望低一點，各有各的立塲，各有各的痛苦。這不在我們討論範圍之內，我們祗得擱置不談。關於敎科書的購置也不是一個小問題，我們願意提出幾點來和大家檢討一下。</p>
<p>我們現在所顧意提出來檢討的並非是課本的內容和編制問題（關於這一點當然我們也希望讀者投稿本刋發表各位的高見），我們僅就課本的發行和價格兩方面來講。國定本現在還是歸九家書局聯合發行，敎育部因爲合同的關係，一時對此尙不能有所變更。可是我們希望這九家負責發行的書局至少在數量上要有充足的準備，千萬不要使學生有了國文，沒有算術，有了算術又缺少了史地。再次盡量擴充代售的地方使學生隨處都可以買得到，再不要讓小朋友們跑到四馬路，在書店裏，擁擠了半天，往往還是買不到，此地我們希望各書局事先和各學校當局接洽，最好能由各學校代收書款，代爲分發，這可以省去學生不少的麻煩。</p>
<p>共决關於定價問題，近來各書店都已經加碼了。常然書店自有他們的苦處，人工隨着生活指數高漲，紙張隨着外匯黑市上昇。這一點我們是同情的。可是家長們可受不了。這是文化事業，這是有關於下一代的滋長，我們認爲政府應該負責，只是課本免繳營業稅，這是不够的。我們主張政府應該貸款與這些承印課本的書局，並督促他們用最低　價錢發售。必要時政府應該很順利迅速的批准他們結外匯購買洋紙。</p>
<p>最後，關於翻版書的問題，我們也想提出來請大家注意。根據中美商的，一切「海盜」版的外文書都應停止發售，這是應該的。但是現在有一個事實上的困難，這就是原本書不能很快就到中國米，一般需要原文課本的學生們是否「坐以待書」呢？據我們所知現在訂購外文書籍，有時等了六個月之久還沒有寄來。我們覺得書商對此是很少有辦法的，不知敎育方面能否想想辦法。同時我們希望政府對於西書的進口准予結給外匯，藉以减少學生和學術界的負擔，而資鼓勵我國硏究學術的風氣。</p>
<h3>新聞史上的新時代</h3>
<p>— 默農</p>
<p>（胡道靜著　世界書局出版）</p>
<p>「新聞史上的新時代」一書作者胡道靜，可說是繼報業前輩戈公振而崛起的一個有心人。最近，他　集了他在抗戰前後所作關於新聞史學與史料的文稿，合成一册，其中取材雖不免無雜了一些，但廣博細膩，有足觀者。就文獻的價値而論，誠如作者於一九三九年在「申報六十六年史」一稿序詞中所云：「抗戰以來，慨見文獻易散難聚，不欲遷延，於是理棼抽緒，覿樓盡言，述申報六十六年史。時政　　，文化隆汚，蓋舉馬之一體，而馬未嘗不現於目也。」僅此一篇，筆者認爲作者搜集之　，用力之動，已非一般報人所能企及，他首先注意到了一張大報的創業的經過，人事的變遷，紙面的更迭，內容的改進（包括新聞方面，言論方面，及其他讀料方面），器材的革新，編　政策的轉變，甚至關於　境對該報的影響及該報對環境的影響，都作了詳盡的記述。</p>
<p>本書的最大優點是在於新聞史料的豐富。作者在把整個的體力與精神從事於報人生活之餘，能不厭琑碎苛細，從一大堆亂糟糟的史料和剪報中，整理出這樣有成績的東西，連一點一滴微小的資料也包羅在裏面，是不容我們忽視的。凡所敍述，除鉅細不遺之外，也還生動而且通俗化。例如他談報紙與廣吿的時候，就以胡文虎爲例，使人倍感興趣。據說胡文虎本來是不肯刊登廣吿的，並且認爲他創製的藥品，自有「口碑」，而廣吿「是沒有什麽用處的。」新嘉坡的一家報館，屢次招攬永安堂的廣吿而不得，他們那時便想出了一個法子，要使胡文虎知道「廣吿的力量和用處，於是在報紙封面上刊登大字曰：「胡文虎將何爲？」下註「請看明日此處。」胡文虎自己看已，頓時大爲耐罕。决日，該報又登大字曰：「胡文虎將登廣吿矣！」從此，胡文虎要刊登廣吿了。像這一類雅俗共賞耐人深味的新聞界掌故，充滿了這一部著作，尤其是報紙的起源，邊疆報紙，華僑報紙，外開在華報紙，新聞紙展覽　專　。這是太響的另一個優點和特色。</p>
<p>作者指出許多新聞事業史　者所忽視的『新時代」，而認定自第一次世界大戰以後的新聞事業，早已脫出了口頭新聞，手寫新聞，印刷新聞的三個階段而躍入了較高較新的階段，即廣播新聞時代，而第二次世界大戰則又把廣播新聞時代拋在背後，抬頭探向最好最高的階殺，即「電視新聞」的時代了。這也許是由於編撰的倉促，資料搜集的不够充實，雖然提綱絜領的說了一些，但總覺得不能滿足讀者的需要。爲了使「新聞史上的新時代」更臻於充實完善，更臻於名實相符的標準，筆者顧附帶提出一個小小的希望：希望作者能多多整理「新時代」的資料，使該書重版時增添一部分時代的重量！</p>
<h3>「人類生物學」</h3>
<p>— 田木</p>
<p>——現代生物學叢書第一集——</p>
<p>朱洗著　上海文化生活社出版</p>
<p>這是一部檢討人類生殖秘奧，生命之謎，人種來源以及實騐敎育心理的叢書，共六册。如果我們想找一部生物學和社會科學的入門書籍來看，我敢說這是比較好的一套書了。這裏，將我自己閱讀道書以後所得到的印象，而且認爲比較重要的地方記錄如下，謹向讀者介紹這廣博精湛又深入淺出的科學著作。</p>
<p>一·「蛋生人與人生蛋」：著者以亦莊亦諧的筆法叙述生產傳種不可缺少的男女生殖器官，將牠視同維持本體的一切器宮，公開討論。……，我們中國人認爲生殖器上的東西都是猥　齷齪，不登大雅之堂，咸抱秘而不宣的態度，這是不高明的見解，這是錯誤的成見！（見序文）。正因爲沒有健全的性敎育，才造成一種不堪設想的惡榮。靑年是一生最寳　，最重要的階段，身體發育旺盛，異性的生殖作用和心理衝動，所以對於這一方面的智識，亟需要充分的灌輸。</p>
<p>子體怎樣在毌體生成；自己又如何能生養後代？常今的科學家旣不能效法商紂之暴行，在交合後，「刳剔孕婦」搜檢人卵，而觀察牠的變化，又無別種合於人道的方法；那末，用什麼方法來解決這生殖之謎？本書中都將牠們和盤托出，讀之便人稱快。</p>
<p>二·「我們的祖先」：我們一般人已經是不再信上帝創造人類的說法，最初的生物和人類從那裏進化來的？目前所有生物的原形質都是歷史性的結構，那末人工製造生物是否可能？這些疑難問題，當然還想解決生命之謎的人們願意切磋的。從血型。生理，心理，智能，……各特點上證明我們與猿猴却是遠房的堂兄弟，和猩猩最接近。</p>
<p>中國地質學家在北平周口店鴿子洞發掘到一種最普遍的原始人類化石——「北京人」，是歐洲原人的祖先，亞洲是人種的搖籃，解決人類發源的關鍵。依據人種學家得尼克（Deniker）把現代人種分作六個主要種，再分成廿九族。</p>
<p>三·「重女輕男」：想充分了解生殖的秘鑰，男女之間對於生產孰重孰輕的問題者，不能不讀這一本通俗「實騐發生學」。著者說：第三册的使命，不僅補充第一册之不足，而且還要更進一步，用分析和實騐的方法，探究胚胎初步發育機械原理；再在可能範兩內。試以人工的力量干涉自然的動作。……，</p>
<p>由浮泛的「惟精說」和「惟卵說」，分析精虫和卵球內部結構，十九世紀末葉，開始建定了男女合作的理論。第六章起講述「天然的處女生殖」，在自然界裏有些處女生殖的亞種（像蜜蜂，輪蟲，蚜蟲等）的卵，不經受精而能單獨發育，有些動物的卵，旣經開始單獨發育，然而不能完成其進化。現代學者已能利用人爲的方法替代精虫，使卵獲得「刺激」和「修正」兩動作，單獨發育，終於長出無父的子體。但是父性的造傳。當非精虫不可，人卵的實騐單性生殖，在理論上已是絕對可能。</p>
<p>四。「雌雄之變」：男女的決定是很早的，但定性的確期和定性的原因，至今衆說紛紜。又男女的界限却很浮動，兩性同體的例十甚多（就是性別可疑的男女）。生物學家能够利用外科醫的手術消滅雌雄的性慾，而且還能改變兩性的形性。</p>
<p>人類生殖細胞裏的「性染色體」（異型精虫與同型卵球）的效能，初由質方面，降到量方面，「普通染色體」於定性也有關係；X染色體是雌性因基居留地，生男孩的精虫（無X，或只有Y染色體）應比有X的壽命稍短，他們對溫度，化學品或毒藥的忍耐力互有不同。將來可以利用注射「雄質」，或「雌質」，或者別種化合物的方法，使每對佳偶得到美滿的結果。</p>
<p>（五）「智識的來源」：這裏從動物界最低度的心理—感覺性和向背性—講起，進到各種反射性，本能，以及學習智識的基礎—連憶。憑藉觀察和測騐，蹬明各種動物的心理作用；如猴子的色覺，昆蟲的嗅覺，鳥類和昆蟲的本能及其敎育能性。</p>
<p>蘇聯有位勤樸有恒的生理學家巴夫羅夫（J.Pavlov,1848-1936）以畢生精力硏求「條件反射」問題，用科學方法來分析人心，剖剔意志。</p>
<p>適當的敎育適當的訓練，能使動物改變先天的本能，而習得後天的智識。凡是營安綏的寄生生活，只能使寄生物的智能日趨退化，終成不識不知，失掉了自由的蠢物。</p>
<p>（六）「愛情的來源」：愛情發生的原因，是實際的，生理的，於種族生存非常重要，決不是虛玄的。兩性戀愛是一種生理的表現，雙方受其太體所分泌出的兩性霍爾蒙之刺激，但男女兩方要節慾，才能使夫婦間感情持久。</p>
<p>動物食性與色慾的多寡有關，由多夫多妻的混交形式，進化到一夫一妻的小家庭制度。並申論「一夫多妻制」和「一妻多夫制」的缺點。</p>
<p>母親掛念兒女的情緒常使她忘却本身的愛情，全部種族的發展與繁榮都寄托於「母愛」上面今後亟需提倡合乎科學的孝道。</p>
<p>科學日見昌明，交通日益便利，人與人間的關係日見廣泛，同情和社會的愛情日見增進。「友愛」是可以超國界與種界的，牠甚至不但可以普及於全人類，而且灣可以普及於那些與人類接觸過久的動物。</p>

<h3>評「新詩話」</h3>
<p>— 魯遲</p>
<p>「當我們站在一件藝術作品的前面，而要用科學的觀點去硏究牠的時候，則我們有兩條不同的道路。在一方面，假如那藝術品是一個雕刻，我們可以描幕那個作品，假如那藝術品是一篇詩，我們可以敍出她的內容的本質；我們這樣地做敍述，而這些純粹外表的描寫的全體，便成立了藝術史。在另一方面，我們可以硏究那作品的根基，就是找出什麽是那作品的社會的和個人的起原，什麼思想引導了牠的創造者，什麼是牠的意義，他的對於社會環境的關係，牠的對於民衆的效果；我們要這樣作着說明，作着藝術批評。」</p>
<p>上面是伊可維支在他的名著「唯物史觀的文學論」的開頭的一段話，他吿訴了我們在任何藝術部門，除了牠藝術本身的著作以外，我們還得從縱的方面，要求對於這藝術發展的歷史著作，及在横的方面，更希望有精闢深刻的藝術批評，給與那藝術的成果有一個正確的批判與評價，那末作爲這一方面的藝術部門。牠才有渾然發展的可能，同是牠的發展的路綫也可確切明白。</p>
<p>「詩」，這一個作爲藝術部門最高創作的東西，牠的需要「詩史」，牠的需要「詩評」，顯然的牠是遠超於其他部門的藝術的。然而，我們知道：在中國詩壇上，詩史和詩評工作，一直是被忽視着的。倘使我們把詩歌創作和詩歌理論批評及詩歌歷史工作相比絞，則後者未免做得太不够了。道，顯然地，對於整個詩歌述動都將發生不良的影響。</p>
<p>依據許多編輯文藝副刊的編者的統計，在他們所收的外稿中間，詩歌　份佔着絕對多數，但是可以發表的詩歌，相反地，却又佔着絕對少數，　其原因，都是因爲作者對於詩歌的眞諦的認識欠够。</p>
<p>然而我們要知道：新許自從在一種時代的必然下面被開始加以嘗試以來，到現在已有二十多年的歷史。回過頭去一看，這其間，眞是走盡了迂迴曲折，艱難困苦，紛歧錯雜的道路—甚至於是歧路！直到抗戰爆發前，許許多多的詩人們，在內容和形式方面，都還陷於摸索與彷徨的極　的苦悶當中。那末作爲一個文藝學徒的靑年寫作者，他對於詩歌的了解，他對於詩歌工作的任務的認識，那更不太成問題了？</p>
<p>自從艾靑寫下了「詩論」，黄　眠寫下了「論詩」以後，在目前的詩壇上確已有了兩册指示詩歌工作者的理論的書籍了。前者是川詩的形式來論詩的一個集子，內容是偏於槪念方面的。後者是多用具體的詩材，來解說詩的意境的一個集子，在某些塲合，牠是比槪念式的「詩論」易懂，但有時因舉例深奥，也不見得能使初學者了了於心。但這樣的詩歌理論的工作的提出，對於中國的新詩運動，該有怎樣的供獻啊！</p>
<p>現在筆者更想介紹第三個較爲値得注意的詩歌理論和詩史的集子，那是任鈞先生最近在「新中國出版社」出版的「新詩話」。</p>
<p>「新詩話」，這是十幾年來任先生所寫的詩歌理論和批評文章的一個結集。裏面收集了十七篇文章。</p>
<p>第一篇詩散談，牠是和艾靑的詩論採取同採方式的，以簡短的字句來描劃解說詩歌的本質的文字。依據伊可維支的要求，牠是屬於藝術批評方面的文章。</p>
<p>第二，第三篇新詩話，他是把第一個嘗試寫新詩的胡適之的「嘗試集」起，廣泛　對於郭法若，徐志摩，朱湘，冰心等人的詩稿作一槪括的介紹，這又遂了伊可維支的要求，他是可以屬於藝術史的部門了。</p>
<p>理論和批評乃是一種行動的南針，「新詩話」無論作者和讀者都是念切地需要他啊！「新詩話」在這一方面給了我們對於詩的史的發歷的詳情，也給了我們一個正確的詩的理論批評的認識。秉承了上面三個集子的指示，我們——愛好詩的靑年朋友們，在初初練習寫詩的時候，總　有了詩的理論根據的書籍了。換句話說：「常我們的詩作者在着手寫作時，已可知道應該怎樣去選擇生題。怎樣去處　題材，怎樣去插寫與表現，怎機才能使很形式與內容相吻合……而更重要的一點，我們亦可知道在現社會中，詩歌工作者應該寫怎樣的詩篇。詩的胡適之時代過去了，詩的朱湘，徐志摩時代也已過去了，呈現在我們前而的是一個更簇新的時代，牠是在隨着由國社會的變動與發展而變動與發展着，而且也將隨着中國社會的變動與發展下去。如果所謂新的時代不兌一個空洞的漂亮名詞，那末「目前中國新詩的生流，是以自由詩的崇高的，素樸的散文，揚棄了韻脚與格律的封建覊絆，作爲形式；內容則以豐富的現實的緊密而深刻的觀照，冲過了一切個人病弱的唏噓，與對於歡界蒼白的凝視而努力工作着。」</p>

<h3>水滸傳詞話</h3>
<p>— 葉德均</p>
<p>今所見水滸傳雖有種種不同的本予，但除去晚出的百二十回本和七十回本外，只有文字繁　的兩類。諸種簡本都是從繁本節出，另外增加征田虎王慶的故事。百回的繁本，是百二十回本及諸種簡本的祖本，又相傳出於嘉靖間武定侯郭勛之手，在今存通行本中以這本最爲近古。</p>
<p>百回本以前的水滸傳是甚麼型式呢？</p>
<p>關於這問題的解答，學者問的意見，各不相同。胡適之「水滸傳新考」，是假設有X本，Y本，Z本。鄭西諦先生「水滸傳的演化」，則假定有一與今存諸本不同的羅貫中本存在着。</p>
<p>孫子書先生「由高陽李氏藏百回本水滸傳推測舊本水滸傳」（刋民國三十年香港星島日報望舒兄主編之俗文學第二十五至二十七期），以爲百回本以前的水滸傳是元代南方書會所編的詞話本，他說：</p>
<p>「其易詞話本爲說散本，似在明化治之後正嘉之前。今行百回本水滸傳，當自明嘉靖時郭勛本出。郭本當自嘉靖前舊本出。」但於郭本之前詞話本之後的嘉靖前舊本的存在，未有說明。他據百回本第四十八回（百二十回本同）中一　詩讚，叙宋江所見祝家莊景象的，斷其詞爲　讚之詞，與上下又密合無間，考定這是出於舊本的詞話，是改詞話本爲散文本時刋落未雖的「化石」。</p>
<p>孫氏的說法頗爲精確，但所舉的證據只有原書的一個孤證。偶檢舊籍，無意中却替他找到兩個旁證，更足說明水滸傳確出於詞話本。其一是徐渭「徐文長佚稿」卷四「呂布宅詩序」：</p>
<p>「……始村瞎子習極俚小說，本三國志，與今水滸傳一轍，爲彈唱詞話耳。」案徐渭所指是呂布和貂蟬事，以爲出於盲翁所唱的詞話，與當時所唱水滸傳詞話相類。這雖是以此類彼的說法，但據此說可以推知：在徐渭當時（嘉靖間），三國，水滸都有詞話。其次是錢希言「戲瑕」（借月山房彙鈔本）卷一：</p>
<p>「詞話每本頭上，有請客一段，權做過德勝利市頭迴，此政是宋人借此形彼，無中生有妙處。游詞泛韻，膾炙人口，非深於詞家者，不足與道也。微獨雜說爲然，即永滸傳一部逐迴有之，全學史記體。文待詔諸公，暇日喜聽人說宋江，先講「攤頭」半日，功父（均案：功父爲錢希言字）猶及與聞。今坊間刻本，是郭武定删後書矣，郭故跗注大僚，其於詞家風馬，故奇文悉被剗薙，眞施氏之罪人也。」按此說雖是指「　頭」（即入話）而言，但前面旣說詞話每本都有「德勝利市頭迴」（入話），後面又說「即水滸傳一部，逐迥有之」，則所指水滸傳也當是詞話本。文微明是正德嘉靖間人，錢希言是隆慶萬曆間人，他們都曾聽到彈唱的水滸傳詞話，錢氏且見過詞話本的水滸，足證明代中晚葉尙有水滸傳詞話本普遍的流傳着。</p>
<p>數年前發現嘉靖刊水滸傳殘本，文字與通行木不同，保存詞話本特有的風格。這部嘉靖本的發現，更足證明水滸傳的較古本子是詞話本。這已由推論成爲無疑的事實了。</p>
<h3>散文二章</h3>
<p>— 蘇汎</p>
<p>花</p>
<p>那鮮豓的，那誇張的，那想大吵大鬧一陣的花朶啊！如今又展現在眼前了。</p>
<p>春日，當我推開窗扉，總會看見像海似的寬廣的花，向四處蔓延着。</p>
<p>春天，是開花的季節，各種各樣的花，開在原野；開在山岩；開在旅人底夢裏；開在少女底心裏。</p>
<p>在無花的日子裏，人都愛做着花似的夢，少年飄泊者的夢更是綺麗的，眩目的，夢見春花綴遍了原野；春花綴上了少女底粉頰；夢見希望像花似的怒放了；也夢見那用花鋪成的生命的旅程，那平坦的，炫耀的……</p>
<p>然而花也畢竟是脆弱的，無常的，多少人槪漢着花開花謝；多少人從這裏悟到生命的飄渺。當那盛開的窓外的花開始凋謝時，秋天不是就要走近了嗎？秋天又哪能開花呢？……</p>
<p>花底季節是短促的，花的夢幻更是短促的。</p>
<p>在已往的日子裏，我有着過於年靑的生命，夢裏多彩的花朶開滿在我童稚的心上。無數的秋天過後，在漫長的泥濘的旅程上，現實的鞭子，擊碎了那開在夢裏的浮誇的花朶，如今，我不敢再啓開那塵封封的花底記憶。</p>
<p>如今，春花又傲岸的開滿在窗前了，可是我的小窗還緊閉着呢。</p>
<p>橋</p>
<p>在荒僻的鄕村裏，在喧囂的城市里，我們都會看到橋，各式各樣的橋。</p>
<p>橋，那人類最高智經的結晶！</p>
<p>我也曾夢見輝煌有如埃及大沙漠裏金字塔似的橋，這偉大的橋，建築在人們底心坎上。</p>
<p>這是用思想和情感造成的橋，誰能有造橋的信心。它便會造成在誰的心坎裏。</p>
<p>但這橋也並不是理想的，完美的，有時當情感氾濫渦橋面時，誰都知道我們簡直可以駕着小舟在橋下划來划去了，這橋將更大更寬廣了。</p>
<p>人民底世紀將是造橋的世紀。好的造橋者也將是好的人民。</p>

<p>「猶太人如何——他們不行嗎？我這裏捉到幾個猶太人，就要絞死的奸細——如果他們於你有用，歡迎把他們拿去。」</p>
<p>並不等待我的答話，他派了傳令兵去看看有幾個奸細在候刑。</p>
<p>「我設法對大人解說，人對於我的實驗並不合用，但是他簡直不能理解我的意思，圓睜着雙眼說道：</p>

<p>「正在這時，傳令兵走進來，報吿被捕的奸細中連一個猶太人都沒有——　是羅曼尼亞人和波希米亞人。」</p>
<p>「多麽糟糕！」將軍說，「我爲波希米亞人也不中用吧？……多麽糟糕！……」</p>

<h3>一寸山河一寸血160</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我瞧鶴見十分焦急似的，便安慰他說，「急也無益，反正不出十小時，「〇十二』一定有回電來，問題就有着落……」</p>
<p>「有了！」鶴見不知想着什麼，立刻跳到　桌那邊，就着桌上的簿子，提起筆來，嗤嗤寫着，一張又一張。一會兒寫好了，一按電鈴，喚着勤務，一面把那寫好的兩張字條，遞給我瞧：</p>
<p>「東京參謀本部七十二，中村萍子何組何號？中島咸子，何組何號？迅覆，支平，二一五。」</p>
<p>再看第二張，也是一樣電文，收電人則是「瀋總部一〇二。」這「一〇二」說是我們的「〇二，」名字是賀勝田太郞，是個極得力的助手。看了這兩處電文，知道鶴見把「八」的秘密，從地理的問題，轉到人的問題上了。一會兒我們的勤務，把電文接去了。</p>
<p>「您知道？」鶴見間我，「中島咸子就是萍子口裏「滿洲雌狗』。……不過這也是一種揣測，不相信這個女子就有這般厲害。我倒疑心這個『八的秘密』就是萍子本人！」</p>
<p>「她不是親口可囑你留心「八』嗎？哪有故意叫人留心自己的道理？」我這麽提醒他。</p>
<p>「老大哥，「烟幕」這爾個字您懂得嗎？戰策上不是說，「虛者實，實者虛，虛虛實實，實實虛虛，則莫能測。』安知不是萍子故意搗鬼？」</p>
<p>「我也想起了一句話，你在東京，不是有意要我也走一遭的嗎？可是叫我去對付萍子？」</p>
<p>「給您猜對了。」鶴見笑了起來，」您知道萍子這傢伙，是個中國迷，想學中國話，做中國詩，所以還給自己起了一個中國名字叫柳詩。我那時還不大明瞭她的底細，當她僅僅是個黑龍會的女會員，至多當當間諜；我乘機還替您鼓吹過一番，說您神通廣大，玄衛程度很深……」</p>
<p>鶴見一面說，一面在屋子裏面磨去踅來，忽地一瞧表，立刻跳到門外一按電鈴，搶過了帽子，對我嚷道：「晚了，走，老岳！」</p>
<p>「哪裏去？」我楞起了眼睛。</p>
<p>「忘了嗎？五點了，您不是說五點鏡，可以上協和去瞧您那位長辛店的朋友，吳工程師吳鼎元嗎？」</p>
<p>「哦，我是說每天下午五點，醫院允許病人的親友去探病，並沒知這你今天要去。」</p>
<p>「走」鶴見袞命令似的「反正待在這裏無事，再說，我心下也惦記他得很；可惜那麽一個好人，竟被日本浪人，弄得家破人亡！」</p>
<p>我剛把烟捲等等零碎，放在衣袋內，取了帽子，鶴見也正預備去開門，可巧門上有人輕輕叩了兩下。鶴見順手把門拉開，我回身一瞧，只見門口，一條直綫站着三個人：當頭一個，是一位嬌艷如花，却又英姿煥發的紀　羣小姐，軍服已經脫去，換了一件白底藍花畏旗衫，把女性美的秀麗，都襯托了出來，我沒有見過萍子，不知她美到如何程度。據我的意想，　羣的丰姿決不會輸給萍子半分，也許要高出一籌哩。</p>

<p>問：爲什麼華府屋頂上之美國國旗，在夜問也飄揚着？</p>
<p>答：這是在第一次世界大戰時才開始的。當時覺得在美國應該有一座建築物，在它的頂上國旗永久不停的飄揚着。華府是常選了，因爲它是在軍事定章日落須隆旗之權限之外。</p>
<p>問：怎樣可以知道總統是否在白宮裏？</p>
<p>答：假使總統在外面過夜，白宮上的旗就要收下。</p>

<p>白宮歷史</p>
<p>問：華盛頓城內最老的建築物是什麽？</p>
<p>答：是白宮。它在一七九二年就開始建築，一八〇〇年被佔領時尙未完工，因遭英國人之破壞，一八一五—一七年重建。</p>
<p>問：國會之「期限」（Term）及「會期」（Session）有何不同？</p>

<h3>破顔一笑</h3>
<p>— 麥繼賢</p>
<p>美國有一位政治家說過一旬話：「如果想做美國總統，先得學會笑」。是的，已故美總統羅斯福在他生時的臉兒，都是笑口吟吟的。此外如吳國　市長，聽說他在接見賓客的時候，總是帶着笑臉，所以他不獨得到人家的「敬」，而且還得到人家的「愛」。</p>
<p>喜歡笑臉是人類的天性。我們所喜歡的商店，是因爲夥計能笑臉相迎，我們所喜歡的小孩子，總是那些容易發笑的；我們所歡迎的朋友是那些有說有笑的，而能令舉座皆歡的。男女相悅，笑是最重要的成份，因爲牠能增加男子的親切和女子的嫵媚。</p>
<p>笑是心靈會接的媒介。「相視而笑，莫逆於心」，這種情境何等動人。世上許多仇　，許多糾紛，都是由笑而解決的。再說，笑的本身就是一種美麗，往往爲丁一二人的破顏一笑，滿座生春。「一笑傾城，再笑傾國」，笑的魔力，於此可見。</p>
<p>俗語說：「雖無過犯，面目可憎」。面目可僧的人，就是不懂笑的技巧的人。此外還有一句俗語：「無拒人之意而有拒人之色」，推測牠的意思，是缺乏笑的傾向。</p>
<p>在技巧上，笑的上乘功夫是：令對方向你笑。倘使你有這個本領，你自己笑與不笑倒不成間題了。世界上有許多幽默大師，如馬克吐溫等等，或善於交際的人，他們都能令對方笑個前仰後合。</p>
<p>人世間有不少實的局面，尷尬的塲合，傷心的事情，都靠「笑」來緩和，來打開。比方說，面對着今日的中國，當老百姓的，自然無可奈何只一笑；不然的話，哭喪着臉）與實際又有何補？在極艱苦情形下仍能保持笑容的，道種笑容是一稀力量！</p>
<h3>大大小小都有難題只看你如何解決它</h3>
<p>— Ernest　Dichter作　陳湘摘譯</p>
<p>我們都有難題。我們都因感情的痛苦，恐懼，失望而受苦。這篇文章的目的是協助你認識難題和解決較小的難題。我們都應該具備充分的心理學的知識，以解決較簡單的難題，正如每個人都應該知道如何治療受凉和頭痛一樣。</p>
<p>自慚形穢</p>
<p>每個人都知道自慚形穢，這原是完全正常的。但是如果因此而使我們受到嚴重的控制時，就變爲惡劣的了。一個在老闆的面前不能够啓口的人，在婆婆面前舌頭僵住了的新娘，不愉快的羞怯，甚至誇張的，恐嚇的表像—都是自慚形穢的顯示的症候。</p>
<p>假如你是這種人之一，你能够怎麽辦？假使它並不太嚴重，假使你知道如何做，假使你決定去做它，你自己就能够解決你的間題。</p>
<p>有一個紅頭髮的靑年，他對他的紅髮有敏銳的感覺。他不喜歡它。他確信他的同伴所以瞧不起他就是爲此。不久，紅髮就使他成爲一個惡劣的自慚形穢者。</p>
<p>有一天，他注意到一位講師喜愛的提起他，因爲他有紅頭髮。他開始覺得「與衆不同」可能是一個無限的優點。於是，他讀書更用功，成了班中最好的學生。最後，他開始委身於「紅」，用他的頭髮做爲一種個人的標誌。他學習和工作使他的事業如同他的顏色一樣的顯著。他成功了。——他替自己解決了難題。</p>
<p>這個靑年所以能够解決自己的難題，就是因爲他能認識難題，並且能使之　害爲利。</p>
<p>過分恐懼</p>
<p>我們都有一些恐懼的事物。兒童們恐懼他們所不嘉愛的東西。他們怕黑暗，水，或者野獸。成人也有所恐懼，雖然他們也許並不公開表明。</p>
<p>有一個女子，被訓練成歌者，可是她被一種對觀衆的恐懼心麻痺了。每一次將表演，她就會發冷，使她無法登台——這顯然的是一種逃　的手段。這種情形發生幾次之後，她認識了她的潛意識幹的把戲。下一决，雖然她還有對觀衆的恐懼心，雖然她的鼻子和喉　還是被「冷」所牽制，她强迫她自己上台去唱。她拒絕了她的潛意識所發明的逃遁的手段。</p>
<p>最後，她克服了她的恐懼病，「冷病」也不再發生了。她鼓起了自己的勇氣，治療了她的困難。</p>

<h3>中文敎本</h3>
<p>— 中直</p>
<p>報載：「中文大學敎本，將由正中與商務二大書局負責出版」。除去一批以挾洋書爲榮的少爺小姐，對此會淡然置之外，凡眞心向學的學子，莫不額手稱慶。</p>
<p>但是有幾點，我們倒要問問。</p>
<p>第一點要問的是：快不快？不要今天見消息，五年以後才見　　，那就不足道了。</p>
<p>第二點要問的是：用不用？不要中文大學敎本是有了，而我們的敎授仍然一貫作風，「原本」第一！</p>
<p>第三點要問的是廣博不廣博？不要許多科目都沒有，學生依然要借重英文書。</p>
<p>第四點要問的是：名詞統一不統一？不要一羲數詞或一詞數雙，或一詞數譯二令人弄不淸楚。</p>
<p>如果大學敎本能圓滿解決此數點。吾人不但爲自身慶祝：從此中國新文化益將發揚光大了。心理的藥　，管理我們自己。我們孤寂的消磨一個寗靜的黄昏；我們唸一本書，或者乾脆的上床睡覺。</p>
<p>高度緊張或者感情過分的人，是因爲對他的氣質反應得太通分了。有一個對他的職業恐懼的男子，他工作得很好，但是他　怕被辭退。假如在辦公室發生了一點錯誤，他便要　天整夜的沉思默想，這件事的嚴重性。他每次都確信這次要犧牲他的職業了。</p>
<p>後來，有一天，使他自己驚愕的，那長久使他恐懷的心理不再可怕了。他嘲笑他自己的利己的心理。他知道他並不是不勝任的，於是，他收集他的所有的才智吿訴給老闆。他立即發覺自己的可驚的蘊藏的能力，這種能力他從未夢想到曾蘊藏在宙己的身內。不久，他就找到一個新的更好的職業。</p>
<h3>上海要坍下去了</h3>
<p>— 予蜂</p>
<p>外白渡橋，它已成了貫通蘇州河南北交通的要這，但是年久失修，在工務局的詳細察勘下，覺得橋台已經下沉傾側，發生了裂痕，而該局亦已擬定搶救計劃，預備加工修理了。（見上月卅一日報載）</p>
<p>外白渡橋的傾側，似乎也不是近來才有的事情，早在好幾個月前有了這種現象；推究其致此的原因，却因爲橋堍的百老匯大厦太重了，把土地壓得陷了下去。於是，外白渡橋墊脚旣不着實，自極容易發生傾側的現象。</p>
<p>假使外白渡橋不加修理，任其自然，經過相當時期後就很可能驟然倒下。</p>
<p>然而整個的上海又那時那刻不在向下陷落呢？固然敎育，經濟等的衰落與工商等業的不景一氣也是在促使上海的繁榮倒坍，而實際上上海的地面也確實是在下沉。據說從抗戰到現在的上海地面，平均就足足的沉下了八九寸，而平均每年要沉下近一寸的土地；如此算來，上海地而較吳淞海而高出十四餘尺在一百四十餘年以後，上海就可能變成澤國了。</p>
<p>雖然，一百四十餘年對追求現實的上海人還似乎是太遠的時間，但是全市各地地面因爲載重與土質不同而下陷的並不一律，已使有許多大厦——國際飯店，十三層大厦，百老匯大厦等，有着傾斜的趨勢，土地亦將因下沉程度的不同而高低不平；假使萬一因爲大傾斜就倒了下來，那又怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>如果上帝安排的命運是爲人類所改變不了的，在一百餘年後，上海這繁榮的國際都市也許就成角蝦之類的聚居之地，而仍讓魚蝦們來過他們悠閑的海上生活，幾所一向被人　羨着的一二十層底高厦，也祇露出它的上半身在波濤汹湧的海面上，給當時的人們作爲歷史的奇蹟觀摩着。但如果可以「人定勝天」，也許那時上海的四周已築起了比畏城還高的堤壩，海水衝擊着堤壩的邊緣，讓人們在海底深處生活着。</p>

<h3>Government Encourages Export Trade, Adopts Export Subsidy System, National Defense Council Approves Implementation Starting Today</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Dispatch] The Supreme National Defense Council held a meeting at the National Government at 10 a.m. on the 5th, with over thirty attendees. Chairman Chiang personally presided and approved the following important matters:</p>
<p>A, In order to encourage exports, the government will provide a subsidy of 100% of the export price for foreign exchange settlement of export goods. (Excluding the Nine Eastern Provinces and Taiwan) For certain types of imported goods, an additional tariff of 50% of the ad valorem value will be levied based on customs valuation. All machinery and production supplies in Appendix 1 of the Provisional Measures for Import Trade promulgated on November 17th of last year, and items in Appendix 2 such as rice, wheat, flour, coal, and coke, cotton, fertilizer, and sulfuric acid (all of the above-mentioned goods exempt from additional taxes are essential for production and daily use, accounting for about 60% of all imported goods), and imported goods that have arrived at various ports before February 5th, are all exempted.</p>
<p>B, Increase the number of National Assembly members from Shanxi Province by four.</p>
<p>C, The Central Design Bureau and the Party and Government Assessment Committee are merged into the Design and Assessment Office, directly under the National Government. D, The National Government establishes a Legislative Bureau. E, Legislative Member Wang Bingqian passed away due to illness, and Yang Yun is appointed to succeed him. F, Appoint Yang Zongpei as a Supervisory Member.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Committee Member Xiao Zheng and others proposed a "Plan to Implement Planned Economy to Save the Economic Crisis and Lay the Foundation for Reconstruction," which was decided to be handed over to the Economic Affairs Committee, together with the Supreme Economic Council and the Design Bureau, to propose implementation measures to the meeting within two weeks.</p>
<p>Reportedly, this plan was decided after more than half a year of discussion and research by the Economic Research Group of the Innovation Movement Symposium, which consisted of over thirty experts from within the Party. It was jointly proposed by Xiao Zheng, He Zhonghan, Liang Hancao, Liu Jianqun, Lai Lian, etc., with the following key points: Part One, establishing the system of economic planning. Part Two, establishing the implementation of land reform and creating a new agricultural system as the center of economic construction planning. Part Three, the development of industries, mines, trade, and transportation based on the implementation of the agricultural system plan. Part Four, the funds for implementing the planned economy and stabilizing currency and prices.</p>
<p>President Song's Speech</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] The Executive Yuan, in order to encourage the production and transportation of export goods, has submitted a plan for rewards to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval on the 5th, which will be implemented from February 6th. Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei announced the following written statement by President Song at a press conference at 4 p.m. on the 5th: "Since our country has experienced a long period of resistance war, export trade has been on the verge of stagnation, and as a result, the economic vitality of the inland is also on the verge of extinction. Since the victory, due to the destruction of transportation in various places, it has not been restored to date. Goods produced in the inland feel the pain of transportation obstruction. As the mileage and time increase, capital is accumulated, and transportation costs increase, the cost of goods also increases. With the increase in interest rates, the cost may have doubled in a few months. Furthermore, the quality of export goods needs to be improved, and standards need to be established. All of these difficulties and obstacles have made it difficult to promote export trade.</p>
<p>The government is seeking to resolve the above-mentioned difficulties and is making every effort to study strategies to encourage the production and export of export goods. Therefore, an Export Promotion Committee has been established under the Supreme Economic Council, which was established on January 15th of this year. At the same time, the government firmly believes that in order to establish a permanent and sound foundation for our country's export trade, it is necessary to concentrate the experience and strength of the industrial and commercial sectors to be effective. Therefore, the Export Promotion Committee is currently hiring experienced and prestigious figures from the industrial and commercial sectors at home and abroad to serve as consultants and assist in the work, in order to achieve the important tasks of promoting guidance and studying the development of export trade. The committee itself does not engage in any export trade, nor does it intend to monopolize or control export trade."</p>
<h3>100% Subsidy Granted for Foreign Exchange Settlement of Export Goods</h3>
<p>Based on the opinions studied by the Export Promotion Committee of the Supreme Economic Council, the Executive Yuan has submitted a plan to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval today to encourage export trade, which will be implemented from February 6th. That is, from February 6th, when export goods are settled for foreign exchange, the government will provide a subsidy of 100% of the export price. Except for goods exported from the Nine Eastern Provinces and Taiwan Province, because their currency value is in a more advantageous position for the export of goods, no subsidy is required. All goods exported from any port are subject to this rule. The government has also decided to raise the funds for this subsidy by levying an additional tariff of 50% of the ad valorem value on imported goods based on customs valuation from February 6th. However, all machinery and production supplies in Appendix (1) of the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade promulgated on November 17th of last year, and rice, wheat, wheat flour, coal and coke, cotton, fertilizer, and ammonium sulfate in Appendix (2) are exempted from the tariff. All of these imported goods exempted from additional tariffs are essential for production and daily use, accounting for about 60% of the total value of all imported goods. Other goods that have arrived at various ports before February 5th are also exempted.</p>
<p>After the above measures are implemented, export trade can be made more active, which is a necessary measure for promoting foreign trade and reviving the inland economy.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Dispatch] The Ministry of Propaganda held a reception for reporters at 4 p.m. on the 5th, and issued a written statement from President Song, explaining the establishment of the Export Promotion Committee by the Supreme Economic Council and announcing measures to encourage export trade.</p>
<h3>Production of Export Goods May Increase as a Result</h3>
<p>Remarks by a Leader in the Financial Industry</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The government has adopted an export subsidy system and increased import taxes on certain imported items. The reporter made a special visit to a leader in the financial industry yesterday. According to observations, the government originally had an overall plan for foreign exchange and import and export policies, and now it is gradually being implemented. The analysis is as follows: First, opening the foreign exchange market, then reaching the stage of adjusting foreign exchange rates, and then implementing a comprehensive import licensing system to achieve an export subsidy system. This is the only reasonable policy formulated after considering the domestic and international economic and financial situation. According to the explanation, if the government's export subsidy is 100%, it means that the current foreign exchange rate of 3,350 yuan is doubled to 6,700 yuan to purchase the bills of exchange of various exporters. At the same time, the increase in import tax revenue is used to compensate the exporters, which is a win-win situation. It is not believed that the prices of domestic import and export goods will increase as a result. However, it is speculated that this may increase the production volume of export goods. At the same time, efforts should be made to ensure that cooperative producers benefit more from it and to eliminate the exploitation of intermediaries. As for whether the international market price of our country's export goods will fall as a result, it is believed that there is no need to be pessimistic. There are many customers in the international market, and the demand is not limited to one country. Due to the effect of competition, prices will not tend to fall. It is hoped that our country's exporters can make good use of this good opportunity, strive to improve, and then our country's export industry may have a chance to rise.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Foreign Exchange Adjustment Suddenly Lose Support</h3>
<p>Prices of Gold, Paper Money and Goods Should Tend to Stabilize</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, after the market spread the news that the government decided to adopt an export subsidy system, the long-brewing rumors of foreign exchange adjustment suddenly lost support, so the gold and paper money market situation in the afternoon tended to be calm. According to observations from all sides, after the implementation of the export subsidy system and the increase in import tax rates, the defects of the current foreign exchange rate are expected to be compensated, and there is no need for adjustment. It is expected that the current import deficit of our country will gradually improve. International payments can also move towards a balanced state. Prices of gold, paper money, and goods will naturally tend to stabilize.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Dispatch] A reporter recently asked the Youth Party for their opinion on the statement issued by the Communist Party, emphasizing the power of the Political Consultative Conference and denying the treaties and other procedures such as loans made by the government to foreign countries? According to Zuo Shunsheng, the Communist Party has closed the door to peace talks, and the Political Consultative Conference has lost its effectiveness. As for the Communist Party's inability to recognize and be responsible for various foreign affairs, we believe that it cannot achieve any results.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Dispatch] Zuo Shunsheng said: The key to the Communist Party's failure in the past year is three: (1) refusing the National Army to take over the Northeast. (2) refusing the ten-day truce in Zhangjiakou. (3) recently insisting on two preconditions and closing the door to peace talks. After these three mistakes, it seems that the Communist Party is difficult to reverse the situation.</p>

(3) To adjust the existing methods of assisting export trade and thoroughly improve them, so that the original related industries can be quickly modernized to facilitate export trade. (4) To promote the stability and large-scale demand of foreign consumer markets for our export goods.</p>
<h3>Executive Committee Established to Promote Work</h3>

<h3>Democratic League to Hold Central Standing Committee Meeting Today</h3>

<h3>Social Democratic Party Has Reached a Consensus on Participating in the Government</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Social Democratic Party has reached a consensus on participating in the government after holding a Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday. After the meeting, Zhang Junli, Wu Xianzi, and Xu Mengyan jointly issued the following announcement: "Our party has concrete opinions on the issue of reorganizing the government, which will be submitted to the government in the near future. Our party will decide its attitude after receiving a reply." It is also learned that the common opinions of the Social Democratic Party will be taken to Beijing by Secretary-General Lei Zhen today for the government's reference. According to speculation by relevant people, the content of the Social Democratic Party's opinions is nothing more than requesting the government to hold the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee as soon as possible and requesting non-Kuomintang members to serve as the Premier of the Executive Yuan, etc. However, after yesterday's meeting, it may be requested to open up local political power, but it will not be as insistent as the Youth Party. It is also possible that Jiang Yuntian will go to Beijing with Lei Zhen the day after tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Treaties and Agreements Negotiated by Various Countries are All Aimed at the National Government. CCP's Denial of Treaty Declaration is Not Worth Paying Attention To</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing 5th Dispatch] This New China News Agency released a Yan'an telegram, in which the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a statement on the 1st of this month, stating that it would not recognize any treaties or agreements signed by the National Government with foreign countries after January 10th of last year. Regarding this matter, the reporter explored reactions from all sides. According to a certain authority, foreigners have obtained more reliable information, saying that this move by the Communist Party was a pre-determined plan. After the U.S. government announced that the U.S. military would withdraw from China, the Communist Party believed that its anti-American propaganda policy had succeeded, so now, in addition to intensifying its military offensive against the National Government, it must try its best to show the Communist Party as an independent belligerent group in the international community, in order to arouse some kind of external intervention. At the same time, the Central Committee of the Communist Party has secretly ordered party members in various places within the jurisdiction of the National Government, who have public identities and significant past activities, to prepare to withdraw or go into complete hiding in the shortest possible time. On the one hand, it is using its peripheral gray elements to encourage unrest in various places to cooperate with its military moves. Moreover, before and after the withdrawal of prominent figures from the Communist Party, it is conspiring to launch riots in several large cities to strengthen the power of "anti-American" propaganda through action, and even claims that the date of the Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty signed last year, November 4th, is a "National Humiliation Day" design. Therefore, the Communist Party Central Committee's statement on February 1 is an inevitable part of its agenda and is not worth paying attention to. The United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and all the United Nations currently recognize the National Government as the only legitimate government of the Republic of China. In addition to hoping that the National Government will expand its foundation and strengthen the democratic atmosphere, all negotiated treaties and agreements are always aimed at the National Government and will never change due to the Communist Party's unilateral statement.</p>
<h3>Lu Zhong Recovers Laiwu City, Communist Army Suffers Heavy Casualties and Losses, Remnants Flee South, Stalemate in Southern Shandong, Fierce Fighting Near Zaozhuang</h3>

All the wells in the urban area were filled or destroyed. All the residents were also coerced by the Communist Army to leave. The National Army entered this plundered and empty city, and the food, beverages, and utensils were exhausted. Supplies were difficult to obtain, and landmines and explosives pre-buried by the Communist Army were everywhere. Engineers excavated no less than 300 locations. In the morning of the 5th, refugees from the surrounding countryside heard that the National Army had arrived, and many tried to escape. They described the brutal situation under the Communist Army's control, and everyone shed tears. The National Army is providing full assistance to enable them to regain their livelihoods.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Jinan 5th Dispatch] The National Army advancing from Tusi Pass recovered Laiwu County on the 4th. The Ninth Division and Fourth Division of the Communist Army stationed there and a part of the New First Brigade suffered heavy casualties and losses. The remnants fled to the Yinyin direction.

The resistance of the Communist Army in various places was minimal, and they surrendered one after another.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou 5th Dispatch] The battle situation in Southern Shandong is gradually becoming stalemate. The National Army is strengthening the pacification work.

<h3>Liu Bocheng's Troops Suffered Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou 5th Dispatch] In order to support the Communist Army's rebellion in Southern Shandong, Liu Bocheng has launched an offensive against the Henan-Anhui border area in the past two weeks. Six columns of Liu's troops have recently left two columns in Western Shandong, and centered on Juye and Jiaxiang, they are wandering in the triangular area of the Jinpu and Longhai Railways in an attempt to contain the National Army and destroy local administrative organizations. In addition, its Sixth Column is active in the Longhai Railway border area south of Nanqiu and Dangshan, taking the opportunity to destroy the railway at any time. In addition, its Second, Third, and Fifth Columns are separately disrupting the territory of Qixian, Ningling, Zhecheng, and Hao County south of the Longhai Railway, attempting to unite with the Communist Army Wei Fenglou, Zhang Taisheng, and other troops, totaling about 50,000 people, who originally operated in Eastern Henan and Northern Anhui, to establish a new base area in the Henan-Anhui border area, and then connect with Western Shandong to form a new corridor across the Longhai Railway and the Xuzhou-Zhengzhou Pacification Zone. Then Liu Bocheng's troops can threaten Xuzhou in the east and Kaifeng in the west, but the military has proper countermeasures for the Communist Party's conspiracy.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Beiping 5th Dispatch] It is learned here that the Jin Communist Army launched a fierce attack on Wenshui County on the 1st. After several days of fierce fighting, the city finally fell on the afternoon of the 3rd. Initially, three regiments of Xue Yibo's troops of the Communist Army were found in Zihongkou near the county, with the intention of attacking the county. There was also a concentration of the Communist Army near Shouyang, east of Taiyuan. As the county was in a state of emergency, Governor Yan, in view of the tense situation on the outskirts of Taiyuan and the Communist Army's ultimate goal of attacking Taiyuan, decided to organize a protection group and mobilize all manpower and material resources in Taiyuan to arm itself for self-defense, which is now actively underway.</p>
<h3>Licheng Village, West of Pingyao City, Communist Army Flees to the Northwest</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Taiyuan 5th Dispatch] Although the Communist Army in Jin is constantly disrupting various places, it is obviously not attacking the center of gravity. The National Army is currently searching for its main force to expel it. The Independent Second Brigade of the Communist Army, about four regiments, and the troops on the right bank of the Fen River, occupying Licheng Village (20 kilometers west of Pingyao City), were almost completely destroyed by heavy artillery bombardment by the National Army.

<h3>Minister Peng Answers Reporters' Inquiries: Newspaper Page Reduction is a Practical Necessity, Suppression of Yellow Journalism Based on Publication Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Information Department held a press conference on the afternoon of the 5th, presided over by Minister Peng Xuepei. The main questions and answers are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Question: On what legal basis does the Information Department limit the size of newspapers? Does this restriction also apply to foreign language newspapers such as the Continental Daily? How much newsprint was imported last year and how much was used? Under normal pre-war circumstances, how much was needed annually? After the implementation of the restrictions, what is the estimated import quantity and foreign exchange required? Can the Minister tell us each of these figures? Does the Information Department and the Ministry of the Interior have other plans to restrict "yellow journalism"?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) The Ministry's temporary measures to reduce newspaper page size are based on the shortage of paper and the need to save foreign exchange, as well as the requests of most newspaper offices in Nanjing and Shanghai. After convening discussions, an agreement was reached. This measure has been notified to local newspaper associations for voluntary implementation. (2) Whether Western newspapers will reduce page size will also be decided by local newspaper associations. (3) From April to November of last year, the amount of newspaper imports was approximately 25 billion yuan in national currency, equivalent to approximately 11 million US dollars. If calculated for the whole year, it would be around 20 million US dollars. This number is actually five times the pre-war annual import value of 3.8 million US dollars, showing how much foreign exchange is being consumed. (4) The crackdown on so-called yellow journalism is entirely based on the Publication Law. Article 22 of the Publication Law explicitly stipulates that "publications shall not contain records that harm good morals." Article 34 of the same law stipulates that "if the content of a publication violates Article 22 and the circumstances are serious, the Ministry of the Interior or the local competent authority, after reporting to and obtaining approval from the Ministry of the Interior, may prohibit its sale and distribution, and may seize it when necessary.</p>
<p>If the aforementioned publication is a newspaper or magazine, its publication may be suspended for a fixed period.</p>
<p>Not Purchased from the US: Atomic Splitter</p>
<p>Question: The Central News Agency, on February 2nd, reprinted a dispatch from New York stating that the Academia Sinica is purchasing an atomic splitter from the United States for use in atomic experiments, and stated that China has uranium deposits. What steps is the government taking to study atomic energy, and how will it develop and control uranium mines? Can the Minister give a detailed account of the reserves and location of uranium mines?</p>
<p>Answer: The Academia Sinica has not purchased an atomic splitter. The government has not yet taken any major steps to study atomic energy. There is no precise survey of China's uranium deposits.</p>
<p>Question: In the proposed government reorganization plan, will the Information Department still be part of the Kuomintang, or will it be transferred to the government? Can the Minister provide details?</p>
<p>Answer: The Information Department is currently an organization of the Party, and it is also guided by the Executive Yuan. Whether there will be a similar organization in the future reorganized government is still unknown.</p>
<p>Question: After the implementation of constitutional government, will formal meetings of the legislative body be open to the public and the press?</p>
<p>Answer: The President of the Legislative Yuan has already agreed to allow you to attend the meetings. If any of you wish to attend, please inform the Foreign Affairs Section of this Ministry for liaison.</p>
<p>Question: What is the strength of the current Chinese army? Can it be divided into land, sea, and air forces? How many are involved in conflicts with the Communists, and how many are actively fighting and stationed on the front lines? What is the government's current estimate of the total strength of the Communist regular and irregular forces?</p>
<p>Answer: I am very sorry that I cannot answer. However, under the current circumstances, I cannot disclose such figures. (End)</p>

<h3>Subsidies for Recovered Counties and Cities in the Pacification Zone: Ministry of Finance Allocates Over 10 Billion; Gu Zhenggang Arrives in Beiping Yesterday with a Supervisory Team</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The recovered counties and cities in the pacification zones have no local tax revenue.

Therefore, he dispatched the security corps to various places to express condolences. In addition, the important task of the supervisory team is to inspect the local conditions of the pacification zones and supervise the implementation of various government orders. Whether the past policies of the Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee are suitable for the local conditions will also be thoroughly studied during this inspection.

The total amount has reached 300 billion yuan. Although it cannot completely solve the lives of the disaster victims, sending goose feathers from a thousand miles away is enough to show the government's concern for the people.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Taixian, 5th] The Jiangsu North Group of the Pacification Zone Political Affairs Supervisory Team arrived in Taizhou. Last night at 9 p.m., a symposium was held in the county government meeting room to gather various county agencies and legal entities, listen to the work reports of the heads, and raise various difficulties.

Tani Hisao has been in Nanjing for more than two months since he came from Shanghai. When he entered the prison, Tani said, "I used to be wrong about China, but now I understand." He writes a diary every day. I think Tani's words must not be from the bottom of his heart. Looking at his awkward face when he was quibbling about his crimes, how could he admit his mistakes? Colonel Yang also talked about the daily lives of the war criminals. He first talked about the principles of management: treating the war criminals with a broad mind and giving them preferential treatment, and managing the war criminals with strict methods. Their staple and non-staple foods are the same as those of our officers and soldiers. Although prices are high, we try our best to provide reasonable nutrition. They are released for walks every day in the morning and afternoon, and the remaining time is used for war criminals to take baths and change clothes, so there are no lice in the detention center. (Tani's indictment omitted)</p>

<h3>Indonesia and the Netherlands Agree: Safety Zone to Be Established in Palembang</h3>
<p>Punishment of Perpetrators and Compensation Under Negotiation</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] A conflict occurred between the Dutch and Indonesian armies in Palembang, southern Sumatra Island, resulting in heavy losses of life and property for our overseas Chinese. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately lodged a serious protest with the Dutch government. The Dutch side has agreed to provide emergency relief to the affected overseas Chinese. Our side also intends to allocate funds to purchase cloth, food, and other items from Singapore for relief. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also proposed to the Dutch side to establish safety zones in various places, arm local overseas Chinese, and organize security teams. At the same time, it requested the Dutch and Indonesian sides to send team members to participate. The security teams are solely responsible for maintaining local security and are entirely temporary. Once the situation in the Dutch East Indies becomes clear, they will be disbanded. In the event of future conflicts, both sides should respect the neutrality of the overseas Chinese safety zones and not fight in the vicinity. Otherwise, they should notify the overseas Chinese in each safety zone before the fighting so that they have sufficient time to evacuate. The Dutch authorities have expressed their approval of this, but the implementation is still under negotiation. As for the Indonesian side, it is reported that our Consul-General in Batavia, Jiang Jiadong, has lodged a serious protest with Indonesian Prime Minister Shahrir, requesting him to immediately dispatch an emergency rescue team to the Indonesian-controlled area outside Palembang City to rescue the affected overseas Chinese and to effectively prevent local people from committing further acts of harming or shooting overseas Chinese. The issue of safety zones has also been raised. In addition to expressing deep apologies, the Indonesian Prime Minister agreed to consult with the responsible authorities to find ways to handle it. Consul-General Jiang will personally go to Palembang to supervise the handling of the aftermath. In addition, issues such as punishing the perpetrators, providing condolence, and compensation are reportedly under investigation and negotiation by the government.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Another Absurd Statement by the Chinese Communists</h3>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) "Central Committee" issued an absurd statement on February 1, with two main points: (1) The Political Consultative Conference (PCC) is the highest political body in China, recognized by the people of the country and the world powers. All important domestic and foreign affairs that must be approved by the parliament in other democratic countries should be agreed upon by this conference before they can be considered valid. (2) All agreements and understandings reached by the National Government with the world powers in diplomatic negotiations after January 10, 1946, that have not been approved by the Political Consultative Conference, the CCP will not recognize now or in the future, nor will it bear any obligations. After reading this statement, we feel that it is meaningless and childishly ridiculous in both law and fact, and not worth refuting. However, studying the intentions of the CCP in issuing this statement, we have to point out that this is another proof of the CCP's attempt to seize territory by force.</p>
<p>What we find most surprising is that the CCP actually regards the Political Consultative Conference as the highest political organization in our country. On this point, the editorial of this newspaper has repeatedly pointed out the nature of the Political Consultative Conference. It is a political measure to resolve partisan disputes, a political meeting in which all parties exchange opinions and obtain common conclusions, but it is by no means an institution representing public opinion, let alone the highest political organization in our country. How can it be compared with the parliaments of other democratic countries? This is one point. The National Government is the only legitimate government recognized by the people of the country and the world powers. Its negotiations with the world powers and the resulting agreements or treaties, as long as they are handled through legal procedures, can take effect. All descendants of the Yellow Emperor bear the obligations stipulated in the treaty. The CCP's statement almost makes people suspect that the CCP is not a political party organized by the people of the Republic of China. We must remind all levels of society that today China has only one legitimate government, and that is the National Government. No matter how the National Government is reorganized in the future, before the constitution is implemented, China is still in the process of building a nation through the Three Principles of the People, that is, still in the period of tutelage under the Kuomintang. Any treaties it concludes with the world powers can take effect as long as they are handled in accordance with the procedures prescribed by current laws. The Chinese people and any political party have no reason to refuse to recognize or bear treaty obligations. This is the second point.</p>
<p>The CCP is not ignorant of the above two points, but why does it try to fool the people with all its might? The reason is obvious. Since the United States announced the abandonment of mediation and the withdrawal of US troops back to the country, the CCP has gloated, believing that its anti-American propaganda has been successful. In the future, for the National Government, in addition to intensifying the offensive militarily, it will look for new topics in propaganda to confuse international public opinion, in an attempt to gain the recognition of the world powers as an independent belligerent party, thereby weakening the National Government's international status and reputation, and thus provoking international intervention. This is truly an unspeakable "self-inflicted injury" strategy. The CCP only knows the interests of one party and one person, and does not hesitate to put the country and the nation in a place of death. How can it gain the sympathy and support of the people of the country? Therefore, we are not only worried about the future of China, but also feel sorry for the future of the CCP.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from our newspaper's Nanjing correspondent on the 5th, reliable information obtained from foreign sources stated that the CCP "Central Committee" has secretly ordered CCP members in various regions under the jurisdiction of the National Government to use their peripheral gray elements to instigate disturbances and even launch riots, using actions to strengthen anti-American propaganda. It is heard that the CCP has designated November 4, the date of the signing of the Sino-US Commercial Treaty, as China's new "National Humiliation Day." Judging from this news, it is known that the CCP "Central Committee" is really harboring extreme malicious intentions in issuing this statement. From these clues, it is not difficult to find a clue to prove that the CCP's intentions are really too vicious. All the current actions of the CCP are pretentious, trying to threaten the United States, forcing the United States to completely withdraw from China; at the same time, it is wantonly propagating in the international community in order to weaken the position of the Chinese National Government, thereby provoking international intervention in China's internal strife. But can this trick achieve its purpose? We dare to boldly say that China and foreign countries see very clearly the consistent methods adopted by the CCP. It will never fall for its tricks, so all parties do not attach importance to the statement issued by the CCP on February 1. It only feels childish and laughable.</p>
<p>In short, the domestic situation has developed to this point, and it is absolutely not enough for the people who are the masters of the country to merely express heartache or empty calls for peace to reverse the tide. Although we people are all kind people without power and courage, but now that things have come to this, we can no longer not stand up and make a solemn representation to the political parties that are willing to destroy the country's reputation and status, and we can no longer tolerate their irresponsible remarks. We only know that today China has only one legitimate government, and all treaties signed by it with the world powers in accordance with legal procedures are valid. We only hope that the National Government will reorganize as soon as possible, expand its base, and increase the democratic atmosphere. Do not delay due to the CCP's obstruction, so as not to harm the overall situation of the country. In addition, we must warn all levels of society across the country that they must never be mistakenly trapped in the CCP's trap of ruining the country's peace and unity again.</p>
<h3>Subsidies and Surcharges on Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Supreme National Defense Council resolved that, in order to encourage exports, the government will provide a subsidy of 100% of the export price for foreign exchange settlements on exported goods, and impose a surcharge of 50% ad valorem on specified types of imported goods. The implication is that the export exchange rate will be 6.700 yuan, part of the import exchange rate will be 5.025 yuan, and the remaining part will remain at 3.350 yuan. In other words, the foreign exchange rate has not changed, but all exported goods and some imported goods will be given different exchange rates through subsidies and surcharges, and these exchange rates have been increased by 50% to 100%. The gains and losses of this matter can be observed from two aspects.</p>
<p>(1) The Timing of the Adjustment</p>
<p>The authorities have been constantly clarifying rumors about foreign exchange adjustments. Just the day before yesterday, there were still clarification news reports. Unexpectedly, the method of subsidies and surcharges was suddenly decided yesterday and scheduled to be implemented starting today. This seems to be questionable in terms of the government's credibility. However, those who clarify clarify, and those who spread rumors spread rumors. Market speculation and trouble-making do not stop because of clarifications. Some even misrepresent facts, spreading unfounded rumors, which only intensifies the rumor-mongering. Therefore, the authorities' decisive action and prompt decision may not be a wise move. Because a timely decision can at least clarify the atmosphere and stabilize the market.</p>
<p>(2) The Degree of Adjustment</p>
<p>Yesterday, the black market rate for US dollars had already reached 9,500 yuan. Now, the government promises to subsidize the export exchange rate by 100%, which is actually only 6,700 yuan. From the perspective of exporters, this is certainly not considered completely satisfactory. Whether overseas remittances from various places can all be turned over to the government and no longer evaded remains a question.</p>
<p>As for some imported goods, their costs will increase due to the implementation of surcharges, and their competitiveness will naturally weaken, which can provide a lot of help to the sales of domestic products. However, we know that to promote exports, regardless of other conditions, it is necessary to ensure that the price of such goods is at least equal to the price of goods from other countries in the foreign market in order to compete with others. Furthermore, in order to restrict foreign goods, regardless of other conditions, it is also necessary to ensure that the price of such goods in the domestic market is not lower than that of domestic products, so as to prevent dumping. In other words, if the price of exported goods is too high and the price of imported goods is too low, it will be impossible to promote domestic goods and defend against foreign goods. Therefore, if we do not talk about trade policy, then so be it. But if we must encourage exports and control imports, then the rate of subsidies and surcharges should not be determined solely subjectively, but should be based on the prices in the foreign and domestic markets as a standard for adjustment. For example, if the market price of a certain export product abroad is 100,000 in foreign currency, but its cost is 120,000, then it is of course impossible to compete with others under this situation. Now, if a subsidy is given on the exchange rate, it must be subsidized to the point where the selling price can be reduced to 100,000 or less in order to achieve the expected goal. If the amount of the subsidy is too small and the cost is still above 100,000, then the exporter will still lose money, and the export of the goods will still be impossible to promote. The same is true for imported goods. If surcharges are used to restrict their dumping, the surcharge must be increased to the point where it is impossible to compete at a low price, that is, the selling price must at least be equal to the market price of domestic goods in order to offset their dumping power. Therefore, whether the numbers of 100% subsidy and 50% surcharge are appropriate remains to be proven by facts.</p>
<p>Currently, prices in the United States are showing a downward trend, while prices in our country are still gradually rising. If this situation cannot be changed, then the subsidies obtained on foreign exchange will still be offset by this price difference. This point must also be given careful attention.</p>
<p>Every time the foreign exchange rate is adjusted, the value of the legal tender is devalued once. Although this has its necessary reasons in international trade, it is still regrettable in terms of the credit of the national currency. Moreover, the lower the currency value, the weaker the savings, the stronger the mentality of speculation and hoarding, and the more dramatic the fluctuations in general prices. The impact of this is that the wage-earning class becomes more unstable, industrial and commercial accounting lacks certainty, and the government is unable to balance its income and expenditure. Simply put, the entire national economy will be affected by this unstable exchange rate. Therefore, we express our deep sympathy from the perspective of international trade for this disguised adjustment. But for the stability of foreign exchange and currency value, we have even more ardent expectations.</p>

Furthermore, the Jiangyin Fortress Command, in order to ensure the security of southern Jiangsu and strictly prevent Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu from fleeing southward, has established inspection agencies at all open ports along the Yangtze River; military affairs in all subordinate counties will be under unified command for easy deployment at any time. As stipulated by Commander Tang Enbo's command, the open ports in this jurisdiction are Shiyiwei Port, Dongjie Port, and Jiangyin's Huangtian Port and Shen Port. It is hoped that local authorities will cooperate with local troops to organize inspection agencies to strictly control all open ports to prevent Communist bandits from fleeing southward. The Fortress Command has issued Jiangfang Essentials to various counties, stating that if Communist bandits forcibly cross the river, all warning units should make every effort to wipe them out and not allow them to flee southward. The county magistrates of all counties along the Yangtze River should supervise the self-defense teams of all subordinate townships and towns to set up observation posts at all Yangtze River ports and send patrols to maintain strict vigilance. If Communist bandits sneak across and enter the jurisdiction, the county magistrates and township chiefs should immediately report the bandit situation and take appropriate action.</p>

In order to strengthen the local military force and thoroughly [eliminate] the remaining bandits, they must follow the stipulated organization and complete the reorganization within a time limit. Furthermore, recently there have been unscrupulous merchants entering bandit areas to sell live pigs and other goods, and the bandits are taking advantage of them, collecting firearms and ammunition in lieu of taxes. Therefore, merchants are often using the name of the township office to [purchase] real bullets in order to profit. There is concern that some unscrupulous officers and soldiers may be blinded by greed, stealing and selling bullets, not only violating discipline but also strengthening the bandits' strength. This must be strictly prohibited. The consumption of bullets by the township offices in each district is strictly limited to prevent abuses.</p>

<h3>Executive Headquarters Issues Written Report Explaining the Quantity of Supplies Provided by UNRRA to China and the Distribution of Supplies by the Executive Headquarters</h3>
<p>[This City News] The Executive Headquarters spokesman recently issued a written report explaining the quantity of supplies provided by UNRRA to China and the distribution of supplies by the Executive Headquarters last year (1946). It is said that: "UNRRA's total budget for China is 647,500,000 US dollars. Among them, 535,000,000 US dollars are various relief supplies, and the remaining 112,500,000 US dollars are the ocean freight for transporting supplies to China. In the classified budget for UNRRA's supplies to China, industrial and transportation equipment ranks first, with 174,500,000 US dollars; food ranks second, with 133,500,000 US dollars; clothing ranks third, with 95,900,000 US dollars; agricultural equipment ranks fourth, with 86,000,000 US dollars; medical equipment ranks last, with 39,700,000 US dollars. There is also 5,400,000 US dollars for reserves. Last year (1946), 315,000,000 US dollars of supplies were transported to China, so there are still 217,000,000 US dollars of supplies to continue to be transported to China this year.</p>
<p>Among the countries receiving UNRRA assistance, China received the most supplies. We sincerely thank the people of the United Nations for their assistance to China after the war, but China has a vast territory, a large population, and suffered terribly for eight years. Allocating more than 500 million US dollars of supplies to China is still like a drop in the bucket. The distribution of UNRRA supplies is limited to the recovered provinces that have suffered from war. If we calculate the 300 million population of the recovered provinces, the average benefit per person is only 1.7 US dollars. In fact, not everyone in the recovered areas needs relief, and most of the post-disaster supplies are used for public works and are not distributed to any private individuals. However, the average of 1.7 dollars is sufficient to show that the amount of UNRRA supplies to China is limited. In 1944, the United States' war expenses averaged 290,000,000 US dollars per day. UNRRA supplied China with 535 million US dollars of supplies, which is less than two days of war expenses in the United States. We are not dissatisfied with the amount of UNRRA's supply. UNRRA's strength is limited to this and has made the greatest contribution to China. We hope that people in the recovered areas will pay attention to the actual quantity of UNRRA supplies to China and further understand the basic reason why supplies are insufficient for distribution.</p>
<p>Although the UNRRA supplies to China are limited in terms of distribution, they are very heavy in terms of transportation, assembly, and handling.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the Executive Headquarters' operations to December 28th of last year, the Executive Headquarters received a total of 1,348,586 tons of UNRRA supplies (referring to those formally transferred). Among them, food accounted for 60%, transportation equipment accounted for 11%, clothing accounted for 9%, agricultural equipment accounted for 4%, industrial equipment accounted for 2%, medical equipment accounted for 1%, and the rest were various miscellaneous supplies. Of the above supplies, 651,000 tons were transported to various branch offices before December 28th. The regional distribution is as follows:</p>
<p>Hunan 126,316.88 tons</p>
<p>Zhejiang 20,616.62 tons</p>
<p>Shanghai 28,721.95 tons</p>
<p>Jin-Cha-Sui 15,154.53 tons</p>
<p>Hebei 31,544.80 tons</p>
<p>Fujian 17,280.81 tons</p>
<p>Shandong 21,900.07 tons</p>
<p>Northeast Nine Provinces 16,020.86 tons</p>
<p>Henan 53,238.35 tons</p>
<p>Anhui 28,710.59 tons</p>
<p>Guangdong 62,910.05 tons</p>
<p>Taiwan 45,224.04 tons</p>
<p>Hubei 38,145.05 tons</p>
<p>Jiangxi 25,532.85 tons</p>
<p>Jiangsu Nanjing 57,919.88 tons</p>
<p>Guangxi 61,683.46 tons</p>
<p>Hunan received more supplies because of the most severe disaster. The next three provinces are Henan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. The least amount of supplies was transported to the Northeast because local order has not been restored and transportation has been disrupted.</p>
<p>In addition to those transported to various branch offices, before December 28th of last year, the Executive Headquarters transferred 230,000 tons of equipment to relevant government ministries and commissions (such as the various railway bureaus of the Ministry of Transportation) and issued them to affiliated institutions of the Executive Headquarters (such as the Executive Headquarters Highway Brigade, Water Transport Brigade, and Machinery Factory). As of December 28th, only about 90,000 tons of supplies were in warehouses in Shanghai and Hong Kong that had not been transported to the mainland, and the rest were in transit at that time.</p>
<p>Of the total amount of UNRRA supplies received last year, about 210,000 tons of various supplies were sold by the Executive Headquarters to various public and private organizations. This sale was based on the basic agreement signed between the National Government and UNRRA. The proceeds from the sale were used entirely for relief expenses. Countries that accept UNRRA assistance around the world have signed treaties with UNRRA to sell a portion of their supplies as relief funds. The treaty signed between China and UNRRA also has similar provisions."</p>

<h3>U.S. Representative Presents Disarmament Compromise to Security Council, Advocating for Priority Discussion of Atomic Control; Soviet Representative Gromyko Expresses Dissent, Leading to Heated Debate</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 4th] U.S. Representative Austin today presented a compromise proposal to the Security Council in an attempt to reconcile the differing opinions of the U.S. and the Soviet Union regarding the disarmament issue. The U.S. proposal consists of: (1) Establishing a Disarmament Commission; (2) Establishing a special committee to study the recommendations made by the Disarmament Commission; (3) Considering the report of the Atomic Energy Commission at the next meeting. Austin also stated that the United States is bound by the principle of international collective security, and therefore the United States insists that any disarmament plan must first take into account practical security plans. Before fulfilling disarmament obligations, United Nations members must first be assured that such practical security plans can be effectively implemented. The U.S. government firmly believes that international control of atomic energy, including provisions for sanctions against those who violate the control, is a fundamental condition for establishing international peace and security, and for limiting and reducing other weapons. The United States has learned from the painful experience of unilateral disarmament after World War I, and has therefore decided not to repeat the same mistake. In response to the new U.S. proposal, Soviet Representative Gromyko stated that the Soviet Union had already proposed the establishment of a Disarmament Commission in December of last year, so the first item of the U.S. proposal is not new, and the second proposal also seems unnecessary. The United Nations General Assembly already has regulations regarding the work plan of the commission, so establishing a special committee would only delay the work of the Disarmament Commission. Regarding the third item, he also felt it was unnecessary, as the report of the Atomic Energy Commission has already been included in the Security Council's agenda and will be discussed in turn. As for the U.S. statement that it is inconvenient to implement disarmament without effective guarantees, it cannot help but make people suspect whether the United States trusts the United Nations organization and the provisions of its Charter. If the provisions of the Charter are insufficient to guarantee security, then the foundation of the United Nations organization is fundamentally flawed, and then we should rebuild the United Nations organization.</p>
<h3>Organization of Five-Nation Working Group to Draft Disarmament Regulations; China Expresses Full Support for U.S. Proposal</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, 4th] Guo Taiqi, the Chinese representative to the Security Council, expressed his support for the U.S. representative's proposed resolution to establish a Disarmament Commission and to discuss the report of the Atomic Energy Commission on a regular basis, and said that the Chinese delegation would fully support it. Australian Representative Hasluck also gave a speech stating that Australia had already submitted a draft resolution on the disarmament issue, but now the U.S. representative is proposing to prioritize the discussion of the atomic energy issue, which delays the discussion of the disarmament issue. The Australian delegation cannot agree with this. The U.S. representative's proposal to establish a special committee is also redundant. He expressed his strong agreement with what Soviet Representative Gromyko said, and proposed the organization of a committee to draft a joint proposal aimed at bringing the Security Council to a consensus. British Representative Jebb seconded the U.S. representative's proposal to organize a special committee. Finally, U.S. Representative Austin proposed that a committee be organized by the five nations of the U.S., the Soviet Union, France, Australia, and Colombia to draft a joint proposal in accordance with Australia's suggestion.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 5th] The Security Council's five-nation drafting committee is about to meet to discuss the regulations of the Disarmament Commission. There are currently two major trends. First, if serious problems arise, neither the U.S. nor the Soviet Union intends to use their veto power, which is undoubtedly an optimistic factor for future negotiations. Second, the representatives participating in the negotiations should establish an agreement on the military, which will be submitted to the Security Council for adoption to maintain peace. So far, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union have remained silent on this point.</p>

<h3>U.S. Determined to Fully Support United Nations Organization; President Submits Report to Congress Reviewing the Past Year's Work</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: President Truman submitted a 30,000-word first report on United Nations activities in 1946 to Congress, stating that the United Nations organization is proceeding smoothly, but the world's hopes and beliefs in the organization still have the possibility of being betrayed and lost, and that the issue of atomic energy control has not yet been resolved. Truman was proud of the United States' leading position in various sectors. He also stated that there are many obstacles to international problems, but the prospects for the world peace organization are very promising. "Due to the authority and power given to us by history and resources, the United States bears a particularly heavy responsibility. The development of the world situation is of deeper concern to the United States than to any other country." Truman urged the Republican-controlled Congress to provide the same bipartisan support for U.S. foreign policy. Truman said: "In various activities of the United Nations, our policies must be based on a bipartisan position and implemented effectively, not only in the political field, but also in the economic and social fields. Regarding issues such as world economic construction and world trade expansion, we must implement economic cooperation with other countries." Truman said that the work of the United Nations in the past year was to lay the foundation, and there are many obstacles ahead that must be removed in order to achieve the goals of peacefully resolving international disputes, establishing collective security, controlling atomic energy, promoting economic recovery, expanding the world economy, and guaranteeing human rights. The future policy of the United States will fully support the United Nations, not as an expedient measure, but as a permanent policy.</p>

<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 4th] U.S. Senate President and Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee Vandenberg recently stated that he does not intend to go to Moscow to attend the four-nation foreign ministers conference. He has had a "frank discussion" with President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall.

He still relies on the continued success of this bipartisan policy. He will maintain regular contact with Marshall and, if necessary, can go to Moscow to work with him on everything. Democratic Senator Connally, former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that he does not intend to attend the four-nation foreign ministers conference because he is preoccupied with congressional duties, but if the President and Secretary of State ask him to go, then he will go to Moscow.</p>

<h3>Arson Case Re-investigation, Questioning for Seven Hours; Disaster Victim Zheng Zaijian and Others Should Be Summoned to the Case; Court Orders Team Leader Li Xun to Be Released on Bail</h3>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] In the Ximo Road fire case, the District Prosecutor's Office is actively investigating. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Wang Yunfu's daughter, Wang Chuaiqin, and Jin Zhengxuexiang, Zheng Zaijian, and Ju Jin Fang were summoned, as well as the fire brigade leader Li Xun, who was once detained, and fire personnel Wu Yiyong and Zhu Qinghui. At the same time, the detained suspected firefighters Huang Binqi, Shang Zhikui, Dai Rongxian, Li Chengjuan, and Cai Zhiying were also brought to court for questioning. The investigating prosecutor, Shen Zushou, arrived in court at 9:00 AM and began separate interrogations. The first interrogation was of Li Xun. Prosecutor Shen used a complex interrogation method, repeatedly questioning in circles to make the interrogated reveal the truth or show flaws unconsciously, so it took a lot of time. By noon, only Li Xun and Wu Yiyong had been questioned. After a short break at noon, Prosecutor Shen quickly finished his meal and continued the hearing. The summoned victims told the prosecutor as much as possible about the situation on the day of the disaster, and then the five detained firefighters were closely interrogated. Everything from taking advantage of the fire to rob, extorting gold bars, ineffective fire fighting, robbing fluorescent lamps, towels, cotton sweaters and other sundries, the loss of gold bars and ornaments from Wang Yunfu's home, the wardrobe being chopped up, the rubber hose being placed in the tile pile, how the U.S. military assisted in firefighting, etc., was questioned in detail, including human evidence, physical evidence, and the relationship in time. The interrogation continued for seven hours and did not end until 4:00 PM. Except for the five original detained firefighters who were still detained, only Li Xun was released on bail among those summoned yesterday. All the others were ordered to return. The picture on the left shows Wu Yiyong (front) and Zhu Qingrun (back) being summoned for interrogation (taken by this newspaper).</p>

<h3>Opening the Box Today to See if There Are Any Anonymous Tips</h3>

<h3>Fire Chief Complains; Lack of Equipment, Lack of Funds; Difficulties Abound</h3>
<p>Low Quality Due to Unstable Life</p>
<p>[Report from this newspaper] After the Ximo Road fire case occurred, questions arose one after another. There were many doubts about the causes of the fire spreading and the fire rekindling after it was extinguished, as well as the reasons for allowing it to burn for 13 hours. The police department has not yet released a report on the handling of this case. The Fire Investigation Committee specially convened reporters from various newspapers at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 11:00 AM yesterday and invited Fire Chief Zhou Zhaoxiang to attend the report. Fire Chiefs Wang Wentao, Ye Binyong, and Xie Zhisu gave detailed reports on the handling of the fire that day, the causes of the spread, and the situation of the permanent fire, and also explained the dereliction of duty of the firefighters.</p>
<p>Chief Zhou first said: The occurrence of the Ximo Road fire has caused heavy losses to the people and the concern of public opinion. Those engaged in firefighting are extremely ashamed. It is really difficult to improve the firefighting facilities in Shanghai. At present, there are so many illegal buildings, so fires are easy to start. The roads are narrow and the vehicles are crowded, which makes it time-consuming for fire trucks to drive, and the water pressure is too low on weekdays, so it is not enough to fight fires. In addition, there is a lack of hydrants, which is not enough for convergence. According to the calculation of Shanghai's population of more than 4 million, 43 fire zones and 13,000 hydrants and more than 200 fire trucks are needed. However, the current fire department in this city has a total of nine districts, only more than 3,000 hydrants in the city, and 35 fire trucks. The hose is even worse. There are not enough to bear 80 pounds of pressure, less than one-fifth of the total. In the past eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, fire protection facilities have only been consumed, not added, and the degree of damage can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Regarding the character of the firefighters, I believe that they must have a particularly noble character to be qualified to take on firefighting work. In the past, firefighters had good treatment and a good life. It was easy to talk about integrity. But at present, the treatment is poor (the current firefighters' treatment is generally around 14 yuan), and the result of unstable life is that the quality of firefighters has gradually declined, but no matter what, statistically, in the 1063 fire alarms last year, I asked myself that I was not ashamed of the country.</p>
<p>Regarding the funding, the amount passed by the Senate was 1 billion yuan, but in fact, the Municipal Government only received a notice of 500 million yuan, and it has not yet been received. The first 500 million yuan allocated from the enemy and puppet industry was used to order 99,000 feet of hose, two high-pressure truck pumps, and fire parts from the United States in November last year, which will arrive in May. Because fire tools must be supplied to foreign countries, and the funding is so tight, we have to carefully maintain the existing old items, and the firefighters' contribution in this area cannot be erased. The U.S. military's belts are never washed after use, and a new one can be replaced the second time, while our belts have been used for eight or nine years and must be washed every time they are used.</p>
<p>Chief Zhou also emphasized: At present, the firefighters' work morale is very poor. None of the team leaders in the nine districts want to escape.</p>
<p>During the era of the Concessions, each firefighter could get a set of fire suits, a leather helmet, a pair of rubber boots, a cap (with a badge), a single overcoat, a leather belt, an ax, a pair of leather boots, a pair of running shoes, two sets of work clothes, 21 buttons, five pairs of numbers, a white shirt and white pants, and a wardrobe. What the current firefighters have is similar to the quantity in the past, but the quality is very different, and they are all old items from the past few years, so there are many patches on the clothes.</p>
<h3>The Cold Weather on the Night of the Fire Hindered Rescue Efforts</h3>
<p>Following the fire at Seymour Road, the fire department conducted a detailed investigation with the meteorological department, water and electricity companies, and various district teams, and submitted the following comprehensive report yesterday: According to the records of the Observatory, the weather was extremely cold on the night of the fire. The temperature at 9:00 PM was 15 degrees Celsius, and it dropped to zero degrees by midnight. The cold weather undoubtedly affected the rescue work. According to a handbook published by the U.S. Fire Defense Association, cold weather accounted for the majority of the 163 fire accidents that occurred in the United States the year before last.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the water and electricity company, the water consumption on that day was 9,158,800 gallons. The water pressure on Zhejiang Road was as low as 17 pounds and as high as 21 pounds. The water and electricity company increased the water pressure to 40 pounds after receiving notification at 11:25 PM. According to common practice, a water pressure of 30 pounds can reach 60 feet, which should be no problem for extinguishing fires in one-story buildings. However, the fire had already spread, making it difficult to control.</p>
<p>No Damage to Fire Hydrants</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the fire department, there was no damage to the fire hydrants near the scene of the fire. The American army's claim is completely inaccurate. The reason why the nearby hydrants were not used was to maintain the equipment. Because the hydrants on Wuding Road were close to the fire scene, the fire trucks could be in danger. Furthermore, the two hydrants (Nos. 1246 and 1245) on North Shaanxi Road (i.e., Seymour Road) north of Xinzha Road were outdated and only had a narrow diameter of 2.5 inches, while the suction pipes used by the fire department were 5 inches wide, so they could not be used. In addition, due to the limited supply from the underground water pipes, the hydrants located in the middle became ineffective after the ones on both sides were used.</p>
<p>According to the fire department's usual practice, only one fire truck is dispatched for ordinary fires. Two fire trucks are dispatched for fires in factories, hotels, and theaters, or when a fire is reported from a watchtower. Whether to continue to send reinforcements depends on the report from the first truck. Due to the intensity of the fire on Seymour Road, fire trucks from various district teams arrived at the scene, totaling nine vehicles. The fire department has accurate records of the gasoline supply and water pumping conditions of each vehicle. After investigation, each vehicle requested refueling from the district team headquarters, and all vehicles except No. 46 pumped water for at least four hours or more.</p>
<p>Comparison with the Era of the Municipal Council</p>
<p>A comparison of the current fire preparedness with that of the era of the Municipal Council can be seen roughly in the amount of funding allocated. In the era of the former Municipal Council, the fire department's budget accounted for 4% to 5% of the total administrative expenses. The current fire department's budget accounts for only 0.5%. In terms of personnel, there is not much difference. The former British Concession fire department had 83 officers and 658 police officers, and the French Concession had 10 officers and 200 police officers. The current police bureau's fire department has 43 officers, plus 62 fire brigade members, which is 12 more than in the era of the former Municipal Council. The total number of police officers is 797, which is 50 fewer than before.</p>
<h3>Tenants of Petain Apartments Appeal: Property Should Revert to the Executive Yuan for Use; Authorities Order Relocation by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Housing disputes are constantly emerging in the lumber market. Recently, residents of the Petain Apartments at No. 700 Hengshan Road, forced to relocate by the Central Trust Bureau's enemy and puppet property clearing office, have had lawyer Yan Chen Ting appeal to the Executive Yuan, the municipal government, the municipal council, and the Central Trust Bureau. According to reports: the properties were originally enemy property, owned by German expatriates, with seven tenant households who have lived there for years. After the victory, the property rights were taken over by our government, and all tenants continued to reside there as usual, with rent collected monthly by the Real Estate Department of the Central Trust Bureau. Three months ago, the Central Trust Bureau sent a letter to all tenants, stating that the apartment would soon be auctioned off, and tenants interested in purchasing it could submit bids to the bureau. In view of the severe housing shortage in Shanghai, all tenants, after a meeting, replied that they were willing to purchase it and requested priority rights. The Central Trust Bureau replied that they would be notified when a decision was made to sell it by auction. Unexpectedly, on the 30th of last month, four armed individuals, carrying an official letter from the Enemy Property Clearing Office, stated that the apartment was ordered to be used by the Executive Yuan and ordered them to relocate by the end of the month, otherwise the competent authorities would force them to relocate. All tenants believe that such handling by the authorities is a broken promise and have decided to fight for their rights.</p>

<h3>A Young Woman's Vanity Caused Great Pain and Suffering; Nine Surgeries for Breast Inflammation; Tracing the Source of the Misfortune and Suing the Doctor</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] Zheng Xiuhong, a 28-year-old woman from Ningbo, residing at No. 33, Lane 37, Changning Road, naturally loved beauty and often complained that her breasts were not developed enough. On September 2nd of last year, she went to the Shi Plastic Surgery Clinic at No. 205, Lane 587, Jing'an Temple Road for treatment. The clinic's owner, Shi Shuanghu, claimed that injections could enhance the beauty of the lines. Zheng paid two taels of gold in advance for the injections and treatment. Unexpectedly, a week later, she suddenly found inflammation in her breasts. By September 20th, the inflammation had not subsided. Shi Shuanghu said that surgery was necessary. One surgery was ineffective, so a second surgery was performed. This happened again and again, for a total of six surgeries by the end of October. Shi then left Shanghai for Hong Kong on October 30th. Zheng, ashamed to seek treatment elsewhere, continued to be treated by the female assistant at Shi's Plastic Surgery Clinic, who performed three consecutive surgeries. After nine surgeries, not only did she not recover, but her condition worsened. On November 23rd, she went to the Gongli Hospital for treatment, but electrotherapy was also ineffective. The hospital's doctors diagnosed that it would be difficult to recover without a major operation. With Zheng's consent, another surgery was performed on December 11th and she is still recuperating in the hospital. Zheng realized the pain and decided to sue Shi Shuanghu to the police station. After interrogating Shi, the police station transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday.</p>
<h3>Why Wasn't the Wooden Shed Demolished When the Fire Spread? The Director Responded One by One</h3>
<p>After Fire Department Director Zhou completed his report, Ge Kexin, chairman of the Fire Investigation Committee, inquired as to why the fire spread. He asked whether the firefighters could have demolished the wooden shed on the east side of the Wang family's house when No. 29 had not yet caught fire, in order to isolate the fire. Director Zhou replied that, according to the decades of experience of various officers, the fire spread from the window on the second floor of No. 29 to the ceiling of the second floor, that is, the mezzanine between the second and third floors. When the fire was brewing in the ceiling, it was difficult to detect. Furthermore, after the wooden shed was extinguished, no firefighters entered to observe, and the owners of the Wang family's house had also left. This can be proven by two points: (1) the servant's residence on the second floor was burned, and (2) the outside of the third floor was not burned, but the inside was. The reason why the fire could not be controlled was that these Western-style houses were built five years before the Republic of China. According to the report of the Municipal Council, although the house had a fire wall, the wooden frames of the house were pierced through the fire wall. Moreover, according to the research results of the engineering experts of the first section of the Fire Department, there were many wooden frames in the continuous roof, which had been dry for 40 years, so it was very easy for the fire to spread after it penetrated the roof. The eight Western-style houses on Seymour Road were 200 feet long in total, and the entire spread time was reported to be only two hours.</p>
<p>As for why the wooden shed attached to No. 29 was not demolished, Director Zhou's reply was: A fire scene commander must take care of everything on the scene, which is actually difficult, and at least 20 to 30 people were needed to pull down the wooden shed of the Wang house, so there were not enough people at the time. Later, the wooden shed was once extinguished. Although the district team leader Zhu Qinglan entered No. 29 to observe, he retreated after discovering that there was no one in the house. He did not pay close attention to the point of the fire spreading beforehand.</p>
<p>Chairman Ge then told Director Zhou that, according to the results of the Investigation Committee, there were several firefighters in the house before No. 29 spread the fire. What were these people doing in No. 29? If their mission was to observe whether the fire was spreading and they found nothing, letting it spread, then these people should bear the greatest responsibility. Director Zhou nodded in agreement and said that he would investigate closely.</p>
<p>Director Zhou also explained the strict standard for calculating the fire time, which is from the time the alarm is received to the time the fire is controlled. Other factors, such as the time before the fire department received the alarm and the remaining fire after it was controlled, should not be included. Therefore, the correct calculation of this major fire was only four hours, but if the remaining fire was included, it would be 20 hours.</p>

<h3>Excavation of the Fire Site Began Yesterday; Wang Yunfu Was Open-Minded: It's Alright If It's Burned</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The excavation of the five burnt houses began at 2:00 PM yesterday. Wang Yunfu and his daughter Wang Chuqin (Wen Ying) personally supervised the work. The excavation was led by Zhang Da, director of the Police Bureau's Inspectorate Division, and supervised by Inspector Xu Guang, District Representative Liu Jingru, Bao Chief Cai Guozhan, and Jiangning District Branch Officer Lin, along with three police officers. At the same time, Bao Chief Cai hired seven laborers to excavate the collapsed parts of the Wang family's living room and the young mistress's bedroom first. Since the excavation work only started yesterday, only surface work has been done, so no important evidence has been found as of 6:00 PM yesterday. The items found included two iron railings from the stove, a piece of iron sheet from the roof, a camphor wood hinge, two box clasps, and a padlock. In addition, radio parts, movie projector parts, corrugated iron sheets, and other items were also found. All the excavated items have been listed and handed over to the Wang family for inspection.</p>
<p>Wang arrived at the fire site at 2:00 PM yesterday as scheduled to supervise the work. Although he wanted to retire several times, he was finally retained by Director Zhang and Bao Chief Cai. He left at 5:00 PM. He was once surrounded by reporters, but Wang refused to reveal anything. When asked about the 18-karat diamond ring, he flatly denied it, saying it was just the children talking nonsense. When the reporter asked if the loss was very large this time, Wang said he didn't care at all, claiming: "I will live for a maximum of ten more years. I can't take anything with me when I die. Calligraphy, paintings, antiques, etc., are like children's toys, it's alright if they're burned."</p>
<p>The excavation work at the fire site will continue from 8:00 AM this morning. Mayor Wu has allocated 600,000 yuan in excavation funds yesterday and handed them over to Director Zhang to transfer to Bao Chief Cai for responsible handling. According to Bao Chief Cai, the daily wage for the laborers is 15,000 yuan, and they work eight hours a day, so the cost may be more than 600,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Zhongshan Steel Company's Steel Illegally Sold, Proceeds Exceeding Ten Million, Divided into Six Shares, Ministry of Economic Affairs Sends Personnel to Investigate, Transferred to District Prosecutor's Office for Investigation</h3>
<p>[Report from our Newspaper] The Zhongshan Steel Company's Pudong factory was occupied by the Japanese army during the occupation. After the victory, the Japanese left a large amount of scrap steel and ore. Recently, the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau received a secret report stating that someone was illegally selling the steel at the site. The Handling Bureau submitted a report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent Shen Guowei to investigate on August 1st of last year. It was found that a wooden boat with license number 7634 and a wooden boat with an unknown license number were loading steel. Shen Guowei then visited Huang Fuzhen, a suspect in the secret report. Huang directly admitted to the illegal sale, but invited Shen to the Far East Ballroom that evening to talk about it. Shen went to the appointment that night. According to Huang, the motive for the illegal sale was that certain local individuals (who refused to disclose their names) colluded with workers such as Yu Zhenghai to illegally sell the steel. They had transported 20 tons of pig iron, which was sold for 12 million yuan, which was divided into six shares. The local individuals received five shares, and the workers at the site received one share. Huang Fuzhen also tried to bribe Shen with 800,000 yuan.

<h3>Donating Funds to Purchase Aircraft to Support Enemy Nations' Wars of Aggression: Sun Tianchang's Offense is Irrefutable; Military Tribunal Files Public Prosecution for War Crimes</h3>
<p>The case of Korean Sun Youchang, who had a background in mechanical engineering and established the Precision Mechanical Arts Company in Shanghai, involves allegations that in October of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944], he was designated by the enemy military as a Class B military-designated factory. Furthermore, he is accused of collecting various coins on behalf of the enemy, manufacturing munitions, erecting anti-aircraft guns on rooftops, and presenting airplanes to the enemy military. After being reported, he underwent several interrogations and was released on bail. According to reports from reporters, Sun Tianchang's crime of collaborating with the enemy has been confirmed, and Military Tribunal Prosecutor Tu Jun has formally filed a public prosecution. The full text of the indictment is recorded below:</p>
<p>Defendant Sun Tianchang, male, 42 years old, of Korean nationality, residing at 929 Beichang Road, Shanghai. The defendant is suspected of being a war criminal (Case No. 162 of the 35th Year's War Investigation), and after investigation by this military prosecutor, it is deemed that a public prosecution should be filed. The facts of the crime, evidence, and relevant legal provisions are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Defendant Has a Technician Background</p>
<p>Defendant Sun Tianchang, with a background in mechanical engineering, established the Precision Mechanical Arts Company in Shanghai, manufacturing industrial machines such as lathes and milling machines, employing 77 male and female workers. After the enemy military occupied Shanghai, in October of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944], he was designated by the enemy military as a Class B military-designated factory, ordering him to manufacture small milling machine pumps, etc. After the victory, the Enemy and Puppet Industry Administration Bureau of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region confiscated it and allocated it to the state. After the Japanese surrendered, the defendant continued to reside at the original address, but the factory ceased operations.</p>
<p>Suspicious Objects Discovered</p>
<p>On May 28th of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, upon orders to relocate Korean residents from the Hartong Building, discovered eight telescopes and six small cameras in the defendant's showroom, suspected of having military connections. Consequently, the defendant was summoned for interrogation. After investigation, the department determined that the case belonged to ordinary criminal matters and, on July 11th of the same year, transferred it to the Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The defendant was released on bail of 10 million yuan. In October of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], citizens Zhou Hanpu, Han Kaiyuan, and Zhou Qingrong reported to the former Military Statistics Bureau that the defendant had donated airplanes to the enemy, contracted to repair all the machinery of the Jinling Arsenal, occupied the main factory of the British-owned Moudeli Piano Company, collected various coins for the enemy's use in manufacturing munitions, and erected anti-aircraft guns on the rooftop. On December 23rd, Liang Mingfang, a staff officer of the bureau, along with the informants, sealed off a considerable amount of materials at the defendant's association treasury at 1350 Seymour Road and his residence at 929 Beichang Road. On May 4th of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], the Enemy and Puppet Industry Administration Bureau of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region, with Approval No. Hu Zi San Zi 25567 and Notice No. Fa Zi 10906 from the Office of the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Region, ordered that, except for the Japanese orders which should be confiscated, the above-mentioned seized materials and factory property should be returned to the defendant.</p>
<p>Informants Report Again</p>
<p>The informants were dissatisfied with the above disposition and, on August 21st of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], filed a complaint with the Shanghai High Court Prosecutor's Office, requesting that he be punished as a traitor. Subsequently, the office, under Instruction No. Jing Juan Zi San Zi 11068 from the Ministry of Justice, deemed Koreans who originally belonged to Japan as enemies, and on October 21st of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], transferred the case to this court for investigation according to law.</p>
<p>Difficult to Shed War Crime Responsibility</p>
<p>The investigators, Zhou Rongqing, etc., do not know the defendant, but the matters they reported are vivid. Hu Chenggen, a worker at the Arts and Crafts Company, also provided testimony unfavorable to the defendant at the High Prosecutor's Office, indicating considerable criminal suspicion. Upon interrogation, the defendant admitted to donating 400,000 yuan to the enemy, used by the enemy to purchase machinery. As for Hu Chenggen, he claimed to be a dismissed worker with accumulated grievances. He also argued that the testimony of other witnesses cited by the informants, Zhu Rongfang, Huang Meizhang, Chen Junqiu, Song Genfu, and Ji Xinggen, was not unfavorable to him, so he generally denied the remaining items. However, even based on the defendant's donation of funds to the enemy for the purchase of aircraft, it is clearly an act of supporting the enemy's war of aggression against our country, and it is difficult to evade responsibility for war crimes.</p>
<p>In summary, the defendant should be considered a war criminal and is suspected of violating Article 6, Section 1 of the War Criminals Trial Regulations. In accordance with Article 26 of the same law and Article 230, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed, requesting immediate trial in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Jiang Shangda Sentenced to One Year and Three Months; Lenient Sentence Due to His "Not Inconsiderable Service"; Defendant's Lawyer Represents Him in Court Due to Illness</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Jiang Shangda, who served as the Deputy Chairman of the Puppet Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Textile Industry Association, a member of the Puppet Cotton Control Committee, and a director of the Puppet Business Association, was sentenced by the High Court yesterday morning. Jiang was unable to attend court due to illness, and his defense lawyer, Zhou Yingcai, attended the hearing on his behalf. Chief Judge Liu stood and read out the judgment: "Jiang Shangda colluded with enemy nations to plot resistance against this country, sentenced to imprisonment for one year and three months, and deprivation of public rights for two years. Property is to be confiscated, except for a portion reserved for the necessary living expenses of the family." He briefly added, "The defendant served as the Deputy Chairman of the Puppet Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Textile Industry Association and a member of the Puppet Cotton Control Committee, maintaining the assets of the textile industry and preserving 2.2 million spindles. He also opposed the enemy's control of yarn and cloth, and was detained by the enemy for 83 days. As for serving in puppet positions, he had registered with the Central Statistics Bureau, which has provided a letter proving this. He also subsidized the military expenses of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, which is not inconsiderable service, so the sentence is lenient."</p>
<p>It is noted that Jiang Shangda is suffering from severe lung disease and has been released on bail by the High Court for treatment. He is currently residing at Cambridge Hospital for treatment, and whether his sentence has expired has not yet been calculated.</p>

In the spring of the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], she organized the Puppet Suzhou Tobacco Joint Business Office, which had more than 300 members, and served as the chairman, collecting handling fees from each household. After it was dissolved in March of the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943], she used this foundation to establish the Puppet Commercial Bank, serving as the chairman of the board, using funds to hoard materials. The defendant, with delicate features and wearing a dark gray silk-padded robe, responded to the indictment by saying: "The Puppet Suzhou Tobacco Joint Business Office and the Puppet Commercial Bank were both commercial in nature and did not use bank funds to hoard or speculate. They only used customer goods to pledge loans from the puppet Reserve Bank."

<h3>Rice Prices Have Eased; Normalcy to Be Restored Soon; Coarse Grains and Oil Cakes Remain in Demand</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper] Under the orders of Mayor Wu to suppress rice prices, the Police Bureau and the Social Bureau are responsible for yesterday's decline. Transactions in the market are still limited to the Siamese rice sold by the Social Bureau. Only a few thousand bags were transacted. The rampant black market situation has been slightly suppressed due to the presence of plainclothes police officers from the Police Bureau. Furthermore, due to the congestion of goods arriving in the Suzhou River, people are taking a small view of the market. Therefore, the black market price of white rice has gradually fallen back to around 85,000 yuan. Some rice shops are also negotiating prices at 76,000 yuan to sell white rice, but the quantity is not large. According to a person in charge of the rice business, the peak of rice prices in the city has passed, and general trading conditions are expected to return to normal in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>A total of 1,240 shi of rice arrived in the city, north and south. The Social Bureau sold 7,310 bags of Saigon rice in total in both the north and south markets. Therefore, the Saigon rice trade in the market is still acceptable. The price of white yin yuan has changed little. There were no transactions outside the market, because shops did not intend to buy. It is heard that it has secretly fallen by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Other coarse grains and oil cakes have risen again due to the soaring price of red gold and the excitement of the people.

<h3>Rice Merchants Disregard Advice; Decision to Punish According to Law; Sixty More Violations Discovered Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau has been dispatching personnel daily to various districts to investigate merchants selling white rice above the agreed price. The day before yesterday, a total of fifty-two merchants were found to be in violation, and their names were submitted to Mayor Wu for severe punishment. However, because the rice merchants claimed that the batch of white rice had been purchased at high black market prices before the government released Siamese rice for sale, Mayor Wu, weighing the circumstances, granted leniency but issued a final warning: from yesterday onwards, anyone found selling in violation of the agreed price will be severely punished. However, yesterday, investigations by the Social Affairs Bureau revealed that as many as sixty merchants were violating the agreed price. Chief Ke immediately telephoned Mayor Wu for instructions. Mayor Wu stated: The government has already shown leniency once, yet they still disregard the advice and violate the agreed price. Therefore, the "Regulations for Punishing Violations of Agreed and Limited Prices" promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs can be applied, in order to deter others.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu also told reporters that he had previously warned the directors of the Rice Merchants Association that if any of their companies were found to be selling in violation of the agreed price, they would be severely punished first.</p>

According to the above new measures, the government's initial purchase of Pingshui tea will be 15,000 dan, and the cost per dan is only 330,000 yuan. The second phase is 19,000 dan, and the value per dan is 275,000 yuan. Under this high price, tea merchants originally had no profit to be made due to cost issues. The government could not dump it abroad. For the sake of both parties, Jiu Xing and Xing Hua companies will undertake the third phase of Pingshui green, and then the three types will be priced at 280,000 yuan per dan to compensate.</p>

<h3>Yarn Dealers Covering Short Positions Off-Market; Yong Yarn Breaks Through Nine Barriers</h3>
<p>Hua shares were initially weak and then strong yesterday. The repeated temptations of the gold market led to a sharp change in the situation as the yarn dealer Hong and others covered short positions off-market, partly driven by activities of shifting gold into stocks. The opening was slightly lower. After opening, it was weak due to overnight floating profits being taken. Deferred delivery retreated to 842 yuan, and immediate delivery stood at 845 yuan. Therefore, with the help of the rising gold market, it soon rebounded to 857 yuan. No. 198, No. 89, No. 180, No. 188, and No. 97 put pressure, and No. 99 also sold Yong Yarn for immediate delivery. Deferred delivery once retreated to around the opening line. As gold prices rose without returning, No. 197, No. 151, No. 145, No. 223, No. 154, and No. 224 all entered the market.

Director Li Gan, Committee Members Wu Weijing, Rong Yixin, and attendees Wang Qiyu, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Zhang Silu, and Liu Wenteng, head of the Business Office of the Textile Control Committee, were present. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>At yesterday's meeting, Director Li Gan announced all the articles of the rules for purchasing foreign cotton that had been passed by the Executive Committee of the Transportation Control Committee a few days ago, and explained them in detail. All attendees did not express any objections. These rules will be implemented starting yesterday. Also at yesterday's meeting, the second allocation was made to yarn factories that had applied for emergency cotton purchases, including Hengtong, Minfeng, Liliyong, Shenxin 7, Qinfeng, and Hefeng. The allocated amount has not yet been finalized. The full text of the rules for purchasing foreign cotton is explored below.</p>
<p>Rules for Purchasing Foreign Cotton</p>
<p>A. Regarding the Yarn Factory Section:</p>
<p>(1) Hereafter, cotton import licenses shall be issued to yarn factories in principle. Each yarn factory applying for an import license shall submit it to the Import Quota Allocation Office.</p>
<p>(2) The Import Quota Allocation Office shall issue import licenses based on the allocation certificates issued by the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee. The Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee shall be composed of the director of the Import Quota Allocation Office and one representative from both state-owned and private yarn factories.</p>
<p>The total foreign cotton quota shall be allocated according to the following standards. The gross amount of foreign cotton that each factory participating in the allocation should obtain shall be divided equally based on the ratio of the number of spindles each factory has in operation to the total number of spindles in operation of all yarn factories. Within the gross amount each yarn factory should obtain, the factory's original inventory and the orders placed before November 17, 1946, that have not yet been imported but have already obtained import licenses, should be deducted. From this, the net amount of foreign cotton the factory should obtain is calculated. Based on this figure, an allocation certificate is issued. The aforementioned allocation amount shall be calculated based on the need for three months of orders beyond the four months of inventory that each factory should have. The inventory and order needs of each factory shall include at least 30% of domestic cotton usage.</p>
<p>(3) Yarn factories intending to purchase foreign cotton shall register with the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee and state the following in the application:</p>
<p>(A) The number of spindles currently in operation;</p>
<p>(B) The current cotton inventory and the expected possible receipt of orders. The Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee has the right to verify the application by means of auditing and verifying the property inventory. If there is any false declaration, penalties may be imposed.</p>
<p>(4) After receiving the allocation certificate, the yarn factory may purchase cotton from one or more cotton importers who have registered with the Provisional Import Management Committee, within the quantity approved by the allocation certificate. The list of registered cotton importers shall be announced to each yarn factory by the committee. Each yarn factory shall attach the allocation certificate when applying for an import license.</p>
<p>(5) When applying for an import license, each yarn factory shall list in detail the payment and shipment methods. In accordance with past cotton business practices, the period for purchasing cotton and settling foreign exchange shall be handled after the arrival of the goods or later, based on the endorsement of the customs on the back of the license. For cotton paid for by letter of credit, foreign exchange can only be settled after the goods are shipped or later.</p>
<p>(6) Cotton ordered by yarn factories before November 17, 1946, that has not been approved by the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank shall be regarded as applications after November 17. Within the scope of the amount approved by the allocation certificate, a reapplication may be made. For this cotton, the yarn factory should be allowed to settle foreign exchange. However, when settling foreign exchange, the price opened in New York (or Mumbai) for the goods of that month on the date of application for the import license shall be the standard for the application. Each yarn factory must list the basic price in the application and fully explain the calculation method of the cost of the item at the port.</p>
<p>(7) The Import Quota Allocation Office has the right to order each yarn factory to purchase cotton from various cotton-producing countries in different currencies according to the ratio stipulated by the Central Bank.</p>
<p>(8) Yarn factories shall not transfer their existing cotton to others without the prior written approval of the Import Quota Allocation Office.</p>
<p>(9) For the convenience of yarn factories, when issuing allocation certificates, the allocation unit may be 50 bales or more at the request of the yarn factory.</p>
<p>B. Regarding the Importer Section:</p>
<p>(1) From now on, import license applications must be submitted by yarn factories to the Import Quota Allocation Office. The issuance of permits is generally aimed at yarn factories.</p>
<p>(2) Permits may be issued for goods ordered before November 17, 1946, that have not been imported, but only if they have been approved by the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank. Otherwise, they will be listed as applications after November 17. The issuance of import licenses shall be handled in accordance with the following regulations:</p>
<p>(A) 1. When paying for the purchase of cotton and settling foreign exchange, the price opened in New York (or Mumbai) for the goods of that month on the date of submission of the import license application shall be the standard for the application.</p>
<p>2. In order to comply with the provision that the issuance of permits should be aimed at yarn factories, if the transported cotton has been sold to someone other than the yarn factory, the cotton shall be resold to the yarn factory.</p>
<p>3. Cotton that has already been shipped on November 24, 1946, but has not been sold may be sold to a yarn factory that has obtained an allocation certificate.</p>
<p>4. Under no circumstances will import licenses be issued for cotton that has not been shipped or sold before November 4.</p>
<p>(B) The cotton purchase limit for this season will be allocated to each yarn factory in the near future. The existing cotton inventory of each factory and the goods ordered before November 17 that have been approved for import shall be accurately calculated in order to determine the allocation amount for each yarn factory. Cotton related to Article 2(A) above shall be regarded as applications after November 17 and may be sold separately to each factory within the scope of the allocation amount that each factory should obtain. Importers should give priority to selling or reselling the above-mentioned cotton to yarn factories with a shortage of cotton, and the yarn factories shall apply for a permit from the Import Quota Allocation Office in accordance with the regulations. For applications after November 17, importers and yarn factories should negotiate the method themselves. The Import Quota Allocation Office shall not be responsible for any disputes arising from the transaction.</p>
<p>(3) Subsequently, yarn factories purchasing cotton from importers shall be limited to importers who have registered with the Provisional Import Management Committee.</p>
<p>(4) Applications that have been submitted to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank and should not be treated as orders before November 17 shall be returned to the original applicant.</p>

<h3>Cheng Qibao Returns from Investigation and Discusses the Education Situation in the Northeast; Reception for Capital Reporters at the Ministry of Education Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Education previously sent a Northeast Education Investigation Team, composed of Cheng Qibao (Member of the Education Research Committee of the Ministry of Education), Zhou Huowen (Deputy Director of the Training Committee), Sun Aitang, and Cai Ruoshui (both inspectors of the Ministry), a group of four, who departed on November 20 of last year for a two-and-a-half-month investigation. They recently returned to Beijing and reported to the Ministry of Education. Our reporter interviewed Committee Member Cheng Qibao to discuss the education situation in the Northeast. I am pleased to report the outline below:</p>
<p>General Situation</p>
<p>The Northeast has nine provinces and two cities. This investigation only focused on the recovered western provinces and key transportation points, such as Shenyang, Siping Street, Changchun, Yongji, Andong, Jinzhou, and Fushun. In terms of the education situation, the recovery is going smoothly. However, the school organization, curriculum, and teaching materials during the enemy and puppet regime were different, and it is difficult to connect and adjust to the current system. The students' level is relatively poor because Chinese was not emphasized before, there was no English, civics, history, geography, or ideology. The above-mentioned points are currently being adjusted, improved, and resolved. Fortunately, the faculty and staff, although in the occupied area for many years, have been able to maintain their inherent spirit and have not been changed by the evil forces' unwavering will. The general middle school youth students are emotional and have a strong enthusiasm for caring about the motherland, which is very strong and is expressed at any time. Their desire for knowledge is particularly deep. Their physical fitness is strong, and their ability to govern themselves is strong, which are all good signs. However, after being oppressed by the enemy and puppet regime for many years, all actions and thoughts have been controlled and unfree for a long time. Now that they have been recovered and liberated, they do not know what to do. Those of us who are responsible for education should reveal the path and provide good guidance. In terms of the general school situation, whether it is a university, middle school, or elementary school, there is a lack of teaching staff and talent, and a large number of supplements are needed. It is hoped that ambitious young people in the mainland can go to the Northeast to assist in the education process. Then, the Northeast will not be difficult to gradually restore its original state with its original good quality. In addition, school equipment was damaged too much during the war. Books and instruments are extremely scarce. Students often sit on the floor in class. It is hoped that the central government will allocate a large amount of funds to relieve the situation and enrich the equipment.</p>
<p>Overview of Higher Education</p>
<p>The original Northeastern University has been restored. Shenyang Medical College has full equipment and a grand scale, ranking first in the country. However, the faculty has not been adjusted. There are still more than 40 Japanese teachers. In addition, Changchun University is located in Changchun, and Changbai Normal College is located in Yongji. The Ministry of Education plans to establish Binjiang University once Harbin is recovered. According to the education situation in the Northeast, many colleges and vocational schools still need to be established, especially vocational schools, which should be established more to cultivate technical talents to supply the needs of local new construction. Because there is a lack of technical talents now, there are still thousands of Japanese technicians left in their posts and unable to be supplemented. Taking the Fushun Coal Mine as an example, there are more than 2,000 Japanese personnel left in their posts. The Resources Committee is also planning to train technical talents for supplementation.</p>
<p>Primary and Secondary Education</p>
<p>Compared with before September 18, the number of middle schools and students has increased, with some increasing by more than one time. However, the level has declined and methods should be sought to improve it. National schools, because some places are unstable, recovery is more difficult, but the general situation is still good, and most can continue to resume schooling. According to the investigation, the number of children out of school accounts for about 60%, so national education should be actively promoted.</p>
<p>Current Status of Social Education</p>
<p>Due to the beginning of the recovery, it has not been fully developed. The original Panyanggang Library has been restored and recently merged with the museum to become the National Shenyang Museum, divided into library and museum departments. The Northeast currently lacks cultural food the most. It is hoped that the central government will transport and supply various publications in large quantities, and electro-optical education equipment is especially needed.</p>
<p>Establishment of Temporary University</p>
<p>When the Northeast was recovered, a temporary university was established with 2,000 students from the enemy and puppet regime's national high school students and specialized students, as well as students returning from Japan. After a year of training, they have been assigned to various universities in the Northeast to continue their studies.</p>
<p>Appeasing Refugees</p>
<p>In order to relieve out-of-school youths who have escaped from the bandit area, a joint middle school was established in Changchun. It has been operating for more than half a year, and there are already 3,000 students. Now, there are rumors that students from Heilongjiang, Harbin, and other places are escaping and going to study.</p>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Northeast Education Investigation Team, including Cheng Qibao, received reporters at the Ministry of Education this afternoon and reported on the education situation in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>Japan to Implement New 6-3 School System</h3>
<p>Three Years of Junior High School Also Compulsory Education</p>
<p>[Gaizosha, Tokyo, 5th] Today, Hidaka, Director of the School Education Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Education, stated that he will overcome all difficulties and implement the new 6-3 school system starting from the new semester in April of this year, that is, every citizen will receive six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, totaling nine years of compulsory education. In the past, compulsory education was limited to six years of elementary school.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Rewards Wartime Bereaved Youth for Further Studies</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Education rewards youth who suffered during the Anti-Japanese War and has specially formulated measures to encourage further studies. The main points are as follows: (1) Young people who were in the occupied areas during the war and suffered due to performing special tasks for our side, and who have been studying at or above the college level and have certificates, can participate in middle school teacher training. After being admitted, they will be trained for half a year and assigned to serve in secondary schools, with a quota of 200 people tentatively. (2) Those who have been studying in secondary schools and have certificates can participate in elementary school teacher training. After being admitted, they will be trained for half a year and assigned to serve in elementary schools, with a quota of 500 people tentatively. (3) Those who have been studying at or above the college level or have graduated and have certificates can participate in education administration training. After being admitted, they will be trained for half a year and assigned to work in education bureaus in various provinces and cities, or assigned as county education bureau chiefs, with a quota of 400 people tentatively. (4) Those who have graduated or studied at secondary schools or above and have certificates, and who are willing to pursue further studies, will be assigned to study in appropriate schools at all levels according to their level after being admitted. In addition to public expenses, they will also be given books and uniforms. For the above four items, the bereaved youth can choose one to participate in further studies according to their academic ability. The Ministry of Education is forming a committee to be responsible for handling this matter.</p>

<h3>Twelve Private Elementary Schools in This City Opened Without Permission</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] According to regulations, the establishment of private schools requires the board of directors to apply for registration and report the opening to the Municipal Bureau of Education for approval before enrolling students and starting classes.

It is reported that the Municipal Bureau of Education has decided to crack down on this, and those who fraudulently use registered names will also be investigated and banned. The previous report detailed the private middle schools that should be banned. It is now known that the National Education Section of the Bureau of Education has separately notified private elementary schools that have not reported for registration for discussions. Those who have not reported and opened without permission will be investigated and banned separately by the resident district supervisors.

<h3>Principals and Teachers of People's Schools Renamed as "Directors"</h3>
<p>Notice Issued by the Municipal Bureau of Education</p>
<p>The principal of a municipal people's school was originally an honorary position, while the teacher in charge was actually responsible for handling school administration and promotion work. In order to match the name with the reality, the 55th Bureau Affairs Meeting of the Municipal Bureau of Education resolved to rename the teachers in charge of municipal people's schools as "Directors" to preside over all school affairs of their respective people's schools. It is reported that the Bureau of Education has issued separate notices to this effect.</p>

<h3>Football Friendly Game Was One-Sided: Railway Team Won Against Hequn Yesterday 4-0, Two Goals in Each Half</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The football friendly game between the Railway team and the Hequn team was held yesterday afternoon at Jinyuan Park. Because no tickets were sold, there were more than 4,000 spectators. The game turned out to be one-sided, with the Railway team winning by four goals and the Hequn team scoring zero. The Railway team led 2-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>The Hequn team has not performed well in this year's football league. Recently, the team has been revitalized and joined the Mayor's Cup competition, hoping to show their potential. Therefore, yesterday's friendly game with the Railway team had a significant test meaning. The result was still disorganized, and they suffered a shutout, which is a cause for concern for their future.</p>
<p>The Railway Team's All-Out Offensive Was Fierce</p>
<p>After the whistle sounded, the army pressed forward, but their footwork was slightly poor. Zhang Jie dribbled three times, and Xiao Ziwen attacked twice, but both failed. Hequn's goalkeeper Yao Chong's business was booming, and center-back Qian Changrong was also extremely busy for a while. At 25 minutes, Zhang Jie of the Railway team led an attack with three troops. Sun and Huang, the two defenders of Hequn, blocked side by side. Zhang Jie passed the ball forward, Yao Chong jumped out to catch the ball but failed, and Lin Dianyi rushed over and kicked it in, and the city of Hequn fell. The whole army was shocked and counterattacked very quickly, but they lacked connection, and the Railway's defense was strict, so they were unsuccessful. At 40 minutes, Zhang Jie of the Railway team, single-handedly rushed into the Hequn's territory and scored another goal. In the first half, the Railway team took the lead with 2-0.</p>
<p>Hequn's Morale Became Even More Scattered</p>
<p>The morale became even more scattered as they switched sides, and they had no power to counterattack. At 20 minutes, Fei Chunlin of the Railway team scored a goal from 20 yards away, making it 3-0. The situation on the Hequn's side became even more miserable, but the generals of the Railway team were ruthless and continued to press on. At 30 minutes, Xiao Ziwen attacked from the side, Yao Chong was a little slow and didn't catch it, and Lin Dianyi suddenly emerged with a cold shot and scored another goal, 4-0. Hequn was at a loss. Later, the Railway's offensive did not slacken, and at times the crowd was crowded on the Hequn's side, forming a funnel shape, which benefited Hequn, because it was impossible for the Railway team to attack from the side. When time was up, Hequn was defeated by the Railway team 4-0.</p>

<h3>Basketball League: Chunmao vs. Giant Tonight</h3>
<p>In the second Basketball League, there were originally three games scheduled for today: the women's group Xuebai vs. the women's Qingzi, the second division Jia You vs. the Railway Shanghai, and the first division Chunmao vs. Giant. However, because most of the players from the Railway Shanghai of the second division Jia You went to Hong Kong with the inter-city team and have not returned, the Basketball Committee decided to allow a postponement. Therefore, today's schedule has been slightly changed. The game will now start at 6:30 PM. The first game is the women's group Xuebai facing the women's Qingzi. The women's Qingzi have been in good condition recently, and they will definitely put up a fierce resistance when they play against Xuebai.</p>
<p>In the first division, Chunmao will play against Giant. The former defeated Hualian in the first game and their momentum is high. The Giant team, with foreigners such as Tao Bolin, the Sa Sijin brothers, Qiang Dulai, and Ye Long, is also not weak. They have pure and skilled connections and an organized lineup. When the two heroes meet, there will definitely be a dramatic performance. The revised schedule for today is: Xuebai - Women's Qingzi (Women's) 6:30 PM Chunmao - Giant (First Division) 7:30 PM</p>

<h3>Observations on Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Mei Jingzhou, Envoy to Cuba</p>
<p>On July 25th, Year 35 of the Republic of China, I received orders to return home to report on my duties. After completing the procedures for purchasing ship tickets, I departed from Pearl Harbor at 2 p.m. on August 9th. I estimate that I will be staying in the motherland for five months. I will now describe my observations on the journey back home and my activities in the country:</p>
<p>Ten Chinese on the Oriental Ship Seemed to be Embracing Their Mother</p>
<p>The ship we were on was the "Oriental" ocean liner. There were ten Chinese passengers traveling with me. I had been away from the motherland for seventeen years. When I boarded the ship, it felt like embracing my mother, and I was very happy. Especially on August 23rd, when the ship arrived at the mouth of the Wusong River, looking out over the entire territory of Shanghai, witnessing the scene of "Recovered Rivers and Mountains, Homeland Renewed," a kind of indescribable joy filled my heart!</p>
<p>On the evening of the 24th, our ship dropped anchor at the entrance of the Huangpu River. It was in the middle of the Yangtze River, and at night everything was silent, and the stars were shining brightly. More than a dozen steamships were moored nearby, and the lights leaking from the ships swayed with the waves, making people feel fascinated. A bright moon hung in the sky, evoking the sentiment of the Tang poem: "This life, this night is rarely good, where shall we see the bright moon next year?"</p>
<p>Losing a Day Imperceptibly Passing Through the "International Date Line" by Boat</p>
<p>On the 25th, which was a Sunday, our ship sailed into the Huangpu River. We saw the docks and warehouses on both sides. Stretching for several miles, huge warships were moored on both sides. Shanghai is truly worthy of being an important commercial port in our country. After arriving at the port, we stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road. The Cathay Hotel has nine floors, overlooking the entire city of Shanghai, everything is clearly visible. That evening, I was invited by President Sun Zhesheng to have dinner at his residence, and it was already midnight when I returned to my residence.</p>
<p>Our ship sailed at a speed of 13.54 nautical miles per hour, traveling approximately 325 nautical miles per day. From departure to Shanghai, the journey took a total of fifteen days. Statistically, during these fifteen days, from August 9th to 13th, the wind was calm and the waves were gentle. Looking out on the deck, I felt the vastness of the sea and sky, without any shore. In such a large universe, an individual is even smaller than "a drop in the ocean"!</p>
<p>On the 14th, because the ship passed through the International Date Line, we imperceptibly lost a day. After the 13th, it was the 15th. Originally, the Earth rotates from west to east, turning fifteen degrees every hour, which is called self-rotation. The entire Earth completes its rotation in exactly 24 hours. At the same time, the direction our ship was traveling was opposite to its direction of rotation, it was heading west, gaining more opportunities to face the sun. Therefore, after passing through this "International Date Line" assumed by geographers, one day should be subtracted to match the dates of various countries in the world. If you are traveling from China to the United States, after passing through this line, you have to add a day.</p>
<p>On that day, the wind and waves suddenly became stronger, and I suffered a lot from "seasickness." It was not until the 19th that the wind and waves calmed down again. After that, until Shanghai, there were no major storms. The above is a rough description of the journey back home.</p>
<p>Ninety Days on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Line to See the Abundant Regions of Jiangnan</p>
<p>From the time I returned to China on August 25th to the end of September, more than a month was spent on banquets and social engagements, which kept me very busy. All those I met were government officials and leaders from all walks of life, so I learned a lot about the situation in the country. During this period, I went to Nanjing once and to Suzhou once. I went to Nanjing for official business, and I went to Suzhou for sightseeing. As the saying goes, "There is paradise above, and Suzhou and Hangzhou below." The beauty of the landscape in Suzhou is indescribable: the clear and unique springs and rocks of Tiger Hill, the secluded and beautiful streams and valleys of Lingyan, and Dengwei, famous for its plum blossoms, all make people linger and forget to return. Other places such as Xiyuan and Liuyuan are very elegantly arranged, while Hanshan Temple and Canglang Pavilion are antique and make people reluctant to leave. Lingyan Temple is about twenty miles outside the city of Suzhou. We went there and climbed to the top of the mountain. Looking down, the scenery of the entire Taihu Lake is indeed a natural and beautiful picture. We know that the output of lake silk accounts for half of the Taihu Lake area, so looking down from the top of the mountain, the mulberry forests and fields are connected, Jiangnan is indeed an abundant region!</p>
<p>There is also one thing worth mentioning: on September 10th, it was already midnight, and Mr. Wang Xianting from the Shenbao newspaper accompanied me to visit the Shenbao. At that time, their editorial department and typesetting room were working hard. The electric lights were bright, and everyone was working spiritedly, almost making people suspect it was daytime rather than late at night. The Shenbao has the longest history, having been founded during the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty. It has the widest circulation, currently reaching more than 150,000 copies.</p>
<p>During the month of October, from the 1st to the 22nd, I went to Nanjing twice, so besides banquets and farewells, I was also constantly traveling on the Nanjing-Shanghai railway line.</p>
<p>Sailing Two Hours Along the Hong Kong Coast into the Pacific Ocean Heading North</p>
<p>During this time in the country, I went to Hong Kong once, on October 23rd. Traveling with me were Consul Li Siling Jiaxiang, Mr. Wang Zhechun, and Western friend Mr. Swiss. We went by plane of the China National Aviation Corporation. At that time, the plane was flying at an altitude of 7,000 feet, and it was quite chilly. That day, we arrived at the Kowloon Airport at 10:30 a.m. and stayed at the Kyoto Hotel. The next day, we took the Anhui ship to Shantou. From Hong Kong to Shantou is 174 nautical miles, which takes 16 hours to sail. After the ship set sail, the harbor was melting and the scenery was pleasant. It can be said that it had both mountain scenery and water scenery. After about two hours, we finished the Hong Kong coast and entered the Pacific Ocean heading north, circling the coast of Guangdong Province. The mountains there were layered upon layered, which looked very beautiful from a distance. The gentle sea breeze blew on our faces, it was truly a pleasure during the journey.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is outside Guangzhou Bay, originally a barren island. After the Opium War, it was ceded to Britain. The British then opened it as a free port, setting up a city on the mountainside, arranged in three rings, upper, middle, and lower, named Victoria City, and sent a governor to manage it. All goods entering and leaving do not need to be taxed, so merchants come here to do trade, and the market becomes prosperous. Now, the telegraph lines and shipping routes are accessible in all directions, making it an important trading center in East Asia.</p>
<p>Since Hong Kong was ceded to Britain, in the tenth year of Xianfeng, a supplementary treaty to the Treaty of Beijing was signed, ceding Kowloon on the opposite side, and they built fortresses to form a strategic position with Hong Kong. In the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu, the Kowloon Concession was also opened, and the islands of Lantau and South Island were also seized one after another, so Hong Kong had full wings.</p>
<p>Staying a Few Days in "Yu Garden" with Pavilions and Buildings on the Mountainside</p>
<p>After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the population gradually increased to about 1.5 million people. When I was there, it was during a labor strike. All the Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong stopped publishing on November 6th. The typesetters of the newspapers put forward requests to improve their treatment: (1) to provide three meals a day, (2) to pay for accommodation, (3) to rest one day a week. The newspaper authorities thought it could not be done, so they stopped publishing on their own. At the same time, the Hong Kong authorities were launching a crackdown on unlicensed small stalls. If implemented, 80,000 people would lose their jobs!</p>
<p>Hong Kong's "Yu Garden" is the property of the late Nanyang overseas Chinese tycoon Yu Dongxuan, located on the mountainside. The pavilions and buildings are extremely magnificent. I stayed here for a few days. I was deeply grateful for the warm hospitality of Madam Yu. As for Aberdeen, which is also known as Pak Tin, it is behind Hong Kong. We went there around the mountain from Pok Fu Lam Road in the Western District. Fishermen gather there, making it the largest fishing port in Hong Kong. Its terrain: to the northwest is Mount Kellett, to the south you can see Ap Lei Chau Island, to the east are the brick kiln and Violet Hill, to the west is Po Toi Island, the peaks are stacked, the smoke and waves are vast. We followed the mountain to Repulse Bay, which is on the back of Hong Kong, a place where the mountains surround the sea, not subject to the impact of tides, surrounded by mountains on three sides, facing the sea, the environment is extremely beautiful. The Japanese army landed here when they attacked Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Smugglers Casually Cast Off Regardless of Police Gunshots</p>
<p>According to the Shenbao on December 23rd, it was said that Hong Kong's trade was declining, with November decreasing compared to October.</p>
<p>The "Anhui" ship we took to Shantou arrived at Shantou Bay at 7:30 a.m. on October 25th. Small hills lined both sides of the bay. Entering the bay, as the ship slowly moved forward, there were two smuggling boats sailing along with our ship. The smugglers on those two boats threw goods down into the boat with ropes. The police officers on our ship fired guns to scare them. They acted as if nothing had happened, leisurely casting off and leaving. This kind of blatant smuggling was quite interesting!</p>
<p>After arriving in Shantou, we rested at the "Moon Garden Apartment." Shantou was opened as a commercial port in the ninth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty. It is the general gathering place for goods from more than forty counties in southern Fujian, eastern Guangdong, and the southeastern corner of Jiangxi. It is the throat of the Han River, with steep cliffs and vast seas. The water flow is very deep, so the entry and exit of cargo ships is extremely convenient. The trade of the Han River is all gathered here. At the same time, Chinese laborers and merchants going to Nanyang all pass through this place, so trade with various ports in Nanyang is also extremely prosperous. Before the war, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and other countries had consulates here. Municipal administration was established in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, and all construction has been very progressive. Shantou is the second most important commercial port in South China after Guangzhou. It currently has a population of more than 188,000 people, the total number of foreigners in the city is 34, the total number of households is 27,497, the number of men is 103,586, and the number of women is 85,355.</p>
<p>Leaving Shantou for Chaozhou Along the Highway to Visit the Han Temple with Thousand-Year-Old Sweet Pear Tree</p>
<p>After playing in Shantou for a few days, at 9:10 a.m. on the 28th, Mr. Wang Chunzhe and Mr. Shen Hongyi and I drove along the Chao-Shan Highway to Chaoan, which is Chaozhou Prefecture, which took about an hour and a half. Along the way, the fresh green grass was smiling to greet us. Chaoan is located at the lower reaches of the Chao River, and it is an important place for travel between Fujian and Guangdong. The urban area is crisscrossed and densely populated. In addition to visiting the silk reeling factory, we also visited the Han Xian Temple and the Han Ting Bridge. There is "Yixi Town" in the northeast of the city, also known as "E Xi," which is where Han Wengong (Tuizhi) wrote an essay to drive away crocodiles when he was the prefect of Chaozhou. The people of Chaozhou were very grateful and built a temple to enshrine him. There is a monument in the temple with the four big characters "Thousand-Year Sweet Pear Tree". It is said that the Han Ting Bridge was built after Han Xiangzi became an immortal. We watched Chaozhou opera in Chaozhou, performed by children. Although it was childish, it had a special charm!</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the Chaozhou Customs: In the fifth year of the Republic of China, each month foreign ships entering from Hong Kong, the Nanyang Islands, and other places numbered 104. The import of goods was 1.16 million tons. In the three months of July, August, and September of the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the average monthly import of foreign ships was about 42, and the import of goods was 26,000 tons. In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, each month domestic ships from ports such as Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Taiwan entering numbered 71, and the import of goods was 110,000 tons. In the three months of July, August, and September of the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the average monthly import of domestic ships from ports such as Guangzhou, Yang, Shanghai, and Taiwan numbered 77, and the import of goods was 1,600 tons.</p>
<p>After returning to China, I felt that the moral degradation of the domestic compatriots, the disappearance of self-esteem, as well as the decline of production, and the chaos of society, all made people feel depressed. In Shantou, I often visited Zhongshan Park, which relieved a lot of the depression in my heart.</p>
<p>Returning to Hong Kong Hearing the Sad News of Donner and Talking About Film Affairs in Friendship</p>
<p>We took the "Chaoan" ship back to Hong Kong on November 4th. On the 10th, the Hong Kong Chinese newspaper published the sad news of the death of Mr. Donner, former advisor to Chairman Chiang, saying that he died of illness at 1:01 a.m. on the 9th at the Hong En Hospital in Shanghai. I had a very deep relationship with Donner, and I was very sad to receive this news. Since returning to China, I had visited him in the hospital twice, and I was very worried because I felt that his physical strength was declining day by day. Donner was 71 years old when he passed away. He was an Australian and had lived in China for 43 years. During the Xi'an Incident, he made great efforts to rescue Chairman Chiang. During this war, he was arrested in the Philippines. Fortunately, he was not recognized and was imprisoned in a concentration camp, where he suffered abuse, which caused him to suffer from severe pulmonary spasms. When I visited the San Francisco World Security Conference, he moved from Lamo Island to Honolulu to seek medical treatment. After a few months, his illness worsened. He came to Shanghai from Honolulu on March 19th, accompanied by Mr. Dong Xian Guang. Unexpectedly, he died of illness in China, how heartbreaking—</p>
<p>Macau's Commerce is Not Prosperous and There is Poor Governance and Many Pirates</p>
<p>On November 11th, I took a boat from Hong Kong to Macau. Macau is at the southern end of the Pearl River Delta, like a small peninsula. It and Hong Kong are both the gateways to the Pearl River, and the situation is excellent. In the thirteenth year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty, the Portuguese came here to colonize, paying an annual rent of 500 taels; in the thirteenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, the treaty of perpetual cession was completed, and it was thus reduced to foreign territory. The city streets are located at the foot of the mountain. Because it is very close to Hong Kong, commerce is not prosperous. There is poor governance, many pirates, gambling is open, and there is even a gambling tax!</p>
<p>Green Pines and Verdant Enjoy the Village - Visiting the Former Residence on the Birthday of the Father of the Nation</p>
<p>On the 12th, it was the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation. At 8:30 a.m., Mr. Zhang Pengyi, Zhang Canrong, Deputy Consul Li, and I drove from Macau and arrived at Cuiheng in Zhongshan County at 9:30 a.m. After tidying up our clothes, we went to admire the former residence of the Father of the Nation. The scenery there is excellent, the mountain scenery is verdant for ten miles, the land is spiritually rich and the people are outstanding, so that a great man like the Father of the Nation could be born, setting an example for thousands of generations and being the savior of mankind. That day, thousands upon thousands of students and people went to admire the hometown of the Premier, and held a solemn memorial ceremony in front of the former residence. After leaving Cuiheng, we followed the highway through Yaikou, Nanlang, Lanbian, Dahuan, and arrived at Shiqi. County Magistrate Zhang Huichang heard that Mr. Yu and others had arrived, and immediately prepared fine wine and delicacies to express his welcome. The kindness was overwhelming, and it was deeply appreciated.</p>

<h3>Regarding Textbooks</h3>
<p>— A Word of Warning</p>
<p>It's the start of the school season again. Parents are busy raising their children's tuition fees, and students are busy purchasing textbooks. The issue of tuition fees has recently been hotly debated by all parties. Those running schools want it to be higher, and parents want it to be lower, each with their own stance and their own suffering. This is not within the scope of our discussion, so we have to set it aside for now. The purchase of textbooks is also not a small problem, and we would like to raise a few points to discuss with everyone.</p>
<p>What we intend to discuss now is not the content and compilation of the textbooks (of course, we also hope that readers will submit articles to this publication to express your opinions), we will only talk about the two aspects of textbook distribution and price. The nationally approved textbooks are still jointly distributed by the nine major bookstores, and the Ministry of Education cannot change this for the time being due to contractual relations. However, we hope that these nine bookstores responsible for distribution will at least have sufficient preparation in terms of quantity, and definitely do not make students have Chinese but no arithmetic, or have arithmetic but lack history and geography. Secondly, expand the places where textbooks are sold as much as possible so that students can buy them everywhere, and don't let the children run to the Fourth Road and squeeze in the bookstore for a long time, often still unable to buy them. Here, we hope that the bookstores will contact the school authorities in advance, and it is best for the schools to collect the book fees and distribute them on behalf of the students, which can save students a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>As for the pricing issue, recently all bookstores have increased their prices. Of course, bookstores have their own difficulties, labor costs are rising with the cost of living index, and paper prices are rising with the black market exchange rate. We sympathize with this. But parents can't bear it. This is a cultural undertaking, this is about the growth of the next generation, we believe that the government should be responsible, it is not enough to just exempt textbooks from business tax. We advocate that the government should provide loans to the bookstores that print these textbooks, and urge them to sell them at the lowest price. When necessary, the government should approve their foreign exchange settlement for the purchase of foreign paper smoothly and quickly.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the issue of pirated books, we would also like to bring this to everyone's attention. According to the Sino-US trade agreement, all "pirate" versions of foreign books should be discontinued, which is appropriate. But now there is a practical difficulty, that is, the original books cannot reach China quickly, should students who generally need original textbooks "sit and wait for the books"? As far as we know, it sometimes takes six months for foreign books to be ordered and not yet sent. We feel that booksellers have very few solutions to this, and we wonder if the education sector can think of a solution. At the same time, we hope that the government will approve the settlement of foreign exchange for the import of Western books, so as to reduce the burden on students and the academic community, and to encourage the atmosphere of academic research in our country.</p>
<h3>A New Era in the History of Journalism</h3>
<p>— Monon</p>
<p>(Written by Hu Daojing, Published by World Book Company)</p>
<p>Hu Daojing, the author of "A New Era in the History of Journalism," can be said to be a deliberate person who has risen after the newspaper industry predecessor Ge Gongzhen. Recently, he has collected his manuscripts on the history of journalism and historical materials written before and after the Anti-Japanese War and compiled them into a volume. Although the materials used are inevitably mixed, they are broad and detailed, and worthy of attention. In terms of the value of the literature, it is as the author said in the preface to "A Sixty-Six Year History of Shenbao" in 1939: "Since the Anti-Japanese War, I have lamented that literature is easy to scatter and difficult to gather. Not wanting to delay, I sorted out the tangled threads, expressed everything I saw, and described the sixty-six year history of Shenbao. At a time of political turbulence and cultural decadence, it is like holding one part of a horse, and the horse is always present in sight." With just this article, the author believes that the author's collection and effort are beyond what ordinary journalists can achieve. He first paid attention to the entrepreneurial process of a major newspaper, the changes in personnel, the changes in the newspaper surface, the improvement of content (including news, commentary, and other reading materials), the innovation of equipment, the transformation of editorial policies, and even the impact of the environment on the newspaper and the impact of the newspaper on the environment. A detailed description has been made.</p>
<p>The greatest advantage of this book lies in the richness of its historical materials on journalism. In addition to devoting all of his physical and mental strength to the life of a journalist, he is able to sort out such fruitful things from a large pile of messy historical materials and newspaper clippings without being tired of trivial details. Even a little bit of small information is included, which cannot be ignored. Everything described is not only detailed, but also vivid and popular. For example, when he talks about newspapers and advertisements, he uses Hu Wenhu as an example, which makes people feel more interested. It is said that Hu Wenhu was originally unwilling to publish advertisements, and believed that the medicines he created had their own "word-of-mouth," and that advertisements "were of no use." A newspaper in Singapore repeatedly solicited advertisements from Yong An Tang but failed. At that time, they came up with a method to make Hu Wenhu know "the power and use of advertisements." So, large characters were published on the cover of the newspaper saying: "What will Hu Wenhu do?" Below was noted: "Please see here tomorrow." Hu Wenhu himself saw it and was immediately very surprised. The next day, the newspaper published large characters again saying: "Hu Wenhu is about to publish an advertisement!" From then on, Hu Wenhu wanted to publish advertisements. This kind of popular and thought-provoking anecdote in the news industry fills this work, especially the origin of newspapers, border newspapers, overseas Chinese newspapers, foreign newspapers in China, and newspaper exhibition special issues. This is another advantage and feature of Tai Xiang.</p>
<p>The author pointed out many "new eras" that have been neglected by historians of the newspaper industry, and determined that the newspaper industry after World War I had already broken away from the three stages of oral news, handwritten news, and printed news, and jumped into a higher and newer stage, namely the radio news era, and World War II threw the radio news era behind it and looked forward to the best and highest stage, namely the era of "television news." This may be due to the haste of compilation and the lack of thorough collection of materials. Although some outlines have been said, it always feels that it cannot meet the needs of readers. In order to make "A New Era in the History of Journalism" more complete and perfect, and more in line with the standard of being worthy of the name, the author would like to add a small hope: I hope that the author can sort out more materials on the "new era" so that the book can add a part of the weight of the times when it is reprinted!</p>
<h3>"Human Biology"</h3>
<p>— Tian Mu</p>
<p>—— Modern Biology Series, Volume 1 ——</p>
<p>Written by Zhu Xi, Published by Shanghai Cultural Life Press</p>
<p>This is a series of six volumes examining the mysteries of human reproduction, the enigma of life, the origins of the human race, and experimental educational psychology. If we are looking for an introductory book on biology and social sciences, I dare say this is a relatively good set of books. Here, I will record my impressions after reading this book, as well as the points I consider more important, and introduce this broad, profound, yet easily understood scientific work to the readers.</p>
<p>1. "Egg-Born People and People Who Lay Eggs": The author uses a humorous and witty style to describe the indispensable male and female reproductive organs for reproduction, treating them as equal to all other organs that maintain the body, and openly discusses them. ... We Chinese people consider things related to reproductive organs as vulgar and dirty, unfit for polite society, and tend to keep them secret and unspoken. This is not a wise view, it is a mistaken prejudice! (See Preface). It is precisely because of the lack of sound sex education that an unimaginable disgrace is created. Youth is the most precious and important stage of life, with vigorous physical development, and sexual reproduction and psychological impulses towards the opposite sex, so there is an urgent need for a full understanding of this aspect of knowledge.</p>
<p>How are offspring formed in the mother's body; and how can they reproduce their own offspring? Modern scientists cannot imitate the tyrannical acts of King Zhou of Shang, "disemboweling pregnant women" after intercourse to search for human eggs and observe their changes, nor do they have other humane methods; then, what methods are used to solve this mystery of reproduction? This book reveals them all, and reading it is refreshing.</p>
<p>2. "Our Ancestors": Most of us no longer believe in the theory that God created mankind. Where did the first organisms and humans evolve from? The protoplasm of all current organisms is a historical structure, so is it possible to artificially create life? These difficult questions are naturally topics that those who want to solve the mystery of life are willing to discuss. From blood type, physiology, psychology, intelligence, ... various characteristics prove that we and apes are distant cousins, closest to chimpanzees.</p>
<p>Chinese geologists excavated a type of most common primitive human fossil – "Peking Man" – in Pigeon Cave, Zhoukoudian, near Beijing. They are the ancestors of European early humans, and Asia is the cradle of the human race, the key to solving the origin of mankind. According to ethnologist Deniker, modern human races are divided into six main races, further divided into twenty-nine ethnic groups.</p>
<p>3. "Valuing Daughters Over Sons": Those who want to fully understand the key to reproduction and the question of who is more important for reproduction between men and women must read this popular "Experimental Embryology." The author says: The mission of the third volume is not only to supplement the inadequacies of the first volume, but also to go a step further, using analysis and experimental methods to explore the mechanical principles of early embryonic development; and to try to interfere with the actions of nature with artificial forces within a possible range. ...</p>
<p>From the superficial "sperm-only theory" and "egg-only theory," to analyzing the internal structure of sperm and egg cells, the theory of male-female cooperation began to be established at the end of the nineteenth century. Chapter 6 discusses "natural virgin reproduction." In nature, some subspecies of virgin reproduction (like bees, rotifers, aphids, etc.) can develop independently without fertilization. The eggs of some animals have already begun to develop independently, but cannot complete their evolution. Modern scholars have been able to use artificial methods to replace sperm, so that eggs can obtain "stimulation" and "modification" actions, develop independently, and eventually grow fatherless offspring. However, paternal creation and transmission must rely on sperm. The experimental parthenogenesis of human eggs is theoretically absolutely possible.</p>
<p>4. "Transformation of Male and Female": The decision of male and female is very early, but the exact timing and reasons for determination are still debated. Moreover, the boundaries between men and women are very fluid, and there are many examples of hermaphroditism (that is, men and women whose gender is doubtful). Biologists can use surgical operations to eliminate male and female sexual desires, and can also change the shape and characteristics of both sexes.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of "sex chromosomes" (heteromorphic sperm and isomorphic egg cells) in human reproductive cells initially changed from quality to quantity, and "ordinary chromosomes" are also related to determination; the X chromosome is a female genetic base. Sperm that produce boys (without X, or only with Y chromosomes) should have a slightly shorter lifespan than those with X, and they have different tolerances to temperature, chemicals, or poisons. In the future, it may be possible to use methods of injecting "male hormones" or "female hormones," or other compounds, to enable each couple to achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>(5) "The Origin of Knowledge": This starts from the lowest degree of psychology in the animal kingdom—sensation and taxis—and progresses to various reflexes, instincts, and the foundation of learning knowledge—memory. Through observation and measurement, the psychological functions of various animals are clarified; such as monkeys' color vision, insects' sense of smell, and the instincts and educational potential of birds and insects.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has a diligent and persevering physiologist, Pavlov (J. Pavlov, 1848-1936), who dedicated his life to studying the problem of "conditioned reflexes," using scientific methods to analyze the human heart and dissect the will.</p>
<p>Appropriate education and appropriate training can enable animals to change their innate instincts and acquire acquired knowledge. All comfortable parasitic lives can only make the intelligence of parasites gradually degenerate, eventually becoming ignorant and losing freedom.</p>
<p>(6) "The Origin of Love": The reason for the occurrence of love is practical, physiological, and very important for the survival of the race, and it is by no means illusory. Sexual love is a physiological expression, with both parties being stimulated by sex hormones secreted by their bodies, but both men and women must exercise restraint in order to make the relationship between husband and wife last.</p>
<p>The diet of animals is related to the amount of sexual desire. From the promiscuous form of polygamy and polyandry, it evolved into a small family system of monogamy. And elaborate on the shortcomings of "polygyny" and "polyandry."</p>
<p>A mother's concern for her children often makes her forget her own love. The development and prosperity of the entire race are entrusted to "maternal love." In the future, it is urgent to promote scientific filial piety.</p>
<p>Science is becoming more prosperous, transportation is becoming more convenient, the relationship between people is becoming more extensive, and sympathy and social love are increasing. "Friendship" can transcend national and racial boundaries. It can even be extended not only to all mankind, but also to those animals that have been in contact with humans for a long time.</p>

<h3>Review of "New Poetry Talk"</h3>
<p>— Lu Chi</p>
<p>"When we stand in front of a work of art and want to study it from a scientific point of view, we have two different paths. On the one hand, if the work of art is a sculpture, we can describe the work; if the work of art is a poem, we can describe the essence of its content; we do such descriptions, and the entirety of these purely external descriptions constitutes art history. On the other hand, we can study the foundation of the work, that is, find out what are the social and personal origins of the work, what ideas guided its creator, what is its meaning, its relationship to the social environment, its effect on the people; we must make such explanations and art criticisms, and give the artistic results a correct critique and evaluation, then as an artistic department in this area, it will have the possibility of complete development, and at the same time its development path can be clearly understood."</p>
<p>The above is a paragraph from the beginning of Ikeweichi's famous book "Literary Theory of Historical Materialism." He tells us that in any artistic department, in addition to the works of art itself, we also have to ask for historical works on the development of this art from a vertical perspective, and from a horizontal perspective, we hope to have insightful and profound art criticism to give the artistic achievements a correct criticism and evaluation. Then, as an art department in this area, it will have the possibility of complete development, and at the same time its development path can be clearly understood.</p>
<p>"Poetry," this is the highest creative thing as an art department, it needs "poetry history," it needs "poetry criticism," obviously it is far beyond other departments of art. However, we know that in the Chinese poetry world, the work of poetry history and poetry criticism has always been neglected. If we compare poetic creation with poetic theoretical criticism and poetic historical work, then the latter has been done too little. Obviously, this will have an adverse impact on the entire poetic movement.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of many editors of literary supplements, poems account for the absolute majority of the unsolicited manuscripts they receive, but the number of poems that can be published, on the contrary, also accounts for the absolute minority. The reason for this is that the authors do not have a sufficient understanding of the true meaning of poetry.</p>
<p>However, we must know that New Poetry has been tried since it was started under a historical necessity, and it has been more than twenty years. Looking back, it is true that we have gone through tortuous, difficult, and complicated paths – even detours! Until the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, many poets were still trapped in the extreme depression of groping and hesitating in terms of content and form. Then, as a young writer of literary studies, his understanding of poetry, his understanding of the tasks of poetry work, is even less of a problem?</p>
<p>Since Ai Qing wrote "Poetry Theory" and Huang Mian wrote "On Poetry," there are indeed two books of theoretical books instructing poetry workers in the current poetry world. The former is a collection of poems in the form of Sichuan poetry, and the content is biased towards conceptual aspects. The latter is a collection of poems that use concrete poetic materials to explain the artistic conception of poetry. In some occasions, it is easier to understand than the conceptual "Poetry Theory," but sometimes it is not necessarily able to make beginners understand because the examples are profound. But what a contribution the presentation of such poetry theoretical work should have to the Chinese New Poetry movement!</p>
<p>Now the author wants to introduce a third more noteworthy collection of poetry theory and poetry history, which is Mr. Ren Jun's "New Poetry Talk" recently published by "New China Press."</p>
<p>"New Poetry Talk" is a collection of poetry theory and criticism articles written by Mr. Ren over the past ten years. It collects seventeen articles.</p>
<p>The first essay, "Poetry Chat," takes the same method as Ai Qing's "Poetry Theory," using short sentences to describe and explain the nature of poetry. According to Ikeweichi's requirements, it is an article belonging to the aspect of art criticism.</p>
<p>The second and third "New Poetry Talk," he started with the "Collection of Attempts" by Hu Shi, who first tried to write new poetry, and made a general introduction to the poems of Guo Moruo, Xu Zhimo, Zhu Xiang, Bing Xin, etc. This also fulfilled Ikeweichi's requirements, and he can belong to the department of art history.</p>
<p>Theory and criticism are the compass of action. Both the author and the readers of "New Poetry Talk" need him eagerly! In this regard, "New Poetry Talk" gives us detailed information on the historical development of poetry, and also gives us a correct understanding of the theory and criticism of poetry. Inheriting the instructions of the above three collections, we—young friends who love poetry—have books with theoretical basis for poetry when we first start practicing writing poetry. In other words: "When our poets start writing, they can already know how to choose life themes, how to deal with them, how to insert writing and performance, and how to make the form and content consistent... And more importantly, we can also know what kind of poems poetry workers should write in the current society. The era of Hu Shi's poetry has passed, and the era of Zhu Xiang and Xu Zhimo's poetry has also passed. What is presented to us is a newer era, which is changing and developing with the changes and development of the national society, and will also change and develop with the changes and development of Chinese society. If the so-called new era is not an empty and beautiful noun, then "the current trend of Chinese new poetry is to use the lofty and simple prose of free verse, abandoning the feudal constraints of rhyme and meter, as the form; the content is to use a rich, realistic, close and profound observation, breaking through all personal sickly sighs and efforts to work for the pale gaze of the realm of joy."</p>

<h3>Word Talk of Water Margin</h3>
<p>— Ye Dejun</p>
<p>Although there are various different versions of Water Margin we see today, in addition to the later 120-chapter and 70-chapter versions, there are only two types with complex characters. All kinds of simplified versions are excerpted from the complex versions, and the stories of conquering Tian Hu and Wang Qing are added separately. The 100-chapter complex version is the ancestor of the 120-chapter version and various simplified versions. It is also rumored to be from the hand of Guo Xun, Marquis of Wuding, during the Jiajing period. This version is the most ancient among the existing popular versions.</p>
<p>What was the form of Water Margin before the 100-chapter version?</p>
<p>Regarding the answer to this question, the opinions of scholars differ. Hu Shi's "New Study of Water Margin" assumes that there are X, Y, and Z versions. Mr. Zheng Xidi's "Evolution of Water Margin" assumes that there is a Luo Guanzhong version that is different from the existing versions.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Zishu's "Speculation on the Old Version of Water Margin from the 100-Chapter Version of Water Margin Hidden by the Li Family of Gaoyang" (published in the 25th to 27th issues of Popular Literature edited by Brother Wang Shu in the Hong Kong Sing Tao Daily in 1941) believes that the Water Margin before the 100-chapter version was a Word Talk version compiled by the Southern Book Society in the Yuan Dynasty. He said:</p>
<p>"The change of the Word Talk version to a prose version seems to be after the Hongzhi and Zhengde periods of the Ming Dynasty and before the Jiajing period. The current 100-chapter Water Margin should be from Guo Xun's version in the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. Guo's version should be from the old version before the Jiajing period." However, the existence of the old version before the Jiajing period between Guo's version and the Word Talk version has not been explained. According to a poem of praise in the 48th chapter of the 100-chapter version (the same in the 120-chapter version), describing the scene of the Zhu Family Village seen by Song Jiang, he determined that the words were the words of praise, and they were closely integrated with the upper and lower parts. He determined that this was from the Word Talk of the old version, and was a "fossil" that was not eliminated when the Word Talk version was changed to the prose version.</p>
<p>Sun's statement is quite accurate, but the evidence cited is only an isolated proof from the original book. When I was examining old books, I accidentally found two collateral proofs for him, which are enough to show that Water Margin did come from the Word Talk version. One is Xu Wei's "Lost Manuscripts of Xu Wenchang" Volume 4 "Preface to the Poem of Lu Bu's Residence":</p>
<p>"...At the beginning, the village blind man learned extremely vulgar novels, based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and the same as the current Water Margin, it was a Word Talk for ballad singing." According to Xu Wei, what he was referring to was the story of Lu Bu and Diao Chan, which he thought came from the Word Talk sung by the blind man, similar to the Water Margin Word Talk sung at that time. Although this is a statement of comparing this with that, it can be inferred from this statement that in Xu Wei's time (Jiajing period), both the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin had Word Talk. The second is Qian Xiyan's "Playful Flaws" (borrowed from the Yue Shan Fang Collection) Volume 1:</p>
<p>"At the beginning of each Word Talk book, there is a section for inviting guests, which is regarded as a past victory market return. This is exactly the wonderful point of the Song people borrowing this form to describe that, creating something out of nothing. The roaming words and generalized rhymes are popular and well-known, and those who are not deeply versed in Ci poetry cannot be told about it. Not only are miscellaneous talks like this, but the entire Water Margin also has it in each chapter, completely learning the style of Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian. Wen Zhengming and other gentlemen liked to listen to people talk about Song Jiang in their spare time, first talking about the 'stall head' for half a day, and Gongfu (Gongfu is Qian Xiyan's name) still had time to hear about it. The current engraved version in the market is the book after Guo Wuding deleted it. Guo was a high-ranking official, and his style was like a strange horse to Ci poets, so all the strange words were cut off, and he was truly a sinner of the Shi family." Although this statement refers to the "stall head" (that is, the introduction), but it said earlier that each Word Talk book has the "victory market return" (introduction), and later said that "even the entire Water Margin has it in each chapter," then the Water Margin referred to should also be the Word Talk version. Wen Zhengming was a person from the Zhengde and Jiajing periods, and Qian Xiyan was a person from the Longqing and Wanli periods. They had both heard the singing Water Margin Word Talk, and Qian had also seen the Water Margin of the Word Talk version, which is sufficient to prove that the Water Margin Word Talk version was widely circulated in the middle and late Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a fragment of Water Margin published in Jiajing was discovered. The characters are different from the popular version, preserving the unique style of the Word Talk version. The discovery of this Jiajing version is even more proof that the older version of Water Margin is the Word Talk version. This has been transformed from speculation into an undoubted fact.</p>
<h3>Two Chapters of Prose</h3>
<p>— Su Fan</p>
<p>Flowers</p>
<p>Those bright, those exaggerated, those flower buds that want to make a lot of noise! Now they are presented before my eyes again.</p>
<p>In spring, when I open the window, I will always see flowers as wide as the sea, spreading in all directions.</p>
<p>Spring is the season for flowering. All kinds of flowers bloom in the fields; bloom on the cliffs; bloom in the dreams of travelers; bloom in the hearts of girls.</p>
<p>In the days without flowers, people love to dream flower-like dreams, and the dreams of young wanderers are even more beautiful and dazzling, dreaming that spring flowers are scattered all over the fields; spring flowers are attached to the pink cheeks of girls; dreaming that hope is in full bloom like flowers; and also dreaming of the journey of life paved with flowers, that is flat, dazzling...</p>
<p>However, flowers are also fragile and impermanent after all. How many people sigh at the blooming and withering of flowers; how many people realize the illusion of life from here. When the blooming flowers outside the window begin to wither, isn't autumn about to approach? How can autumn bloom? ...</p>
<p>The season of flowers is short, and the dream of flowers is even shorter.</p>
<p>In the past days, I had a life that was too young, and colorful flowers bloomed in my childish heart in my dreams. After countless autumns, on the long muddy journey, the whip of reality shattered the ostentatious flowers blooming in my dreams. Now, I dare not open the dusty memory of flowers again.</p>
<p>Now, spring flowers are blooming proudly in front of the window again, but my small window is still tightly closed.</p>
<p>Bridge</p>
<p>In remote rural areas, and in noisy cities, we will see bridges, all kinds of bridges.</p>
<p>Bridge, the crystallization of the highest intelligence of mankind!</p>
<p>I have also dreamed of bridges as magnificent as the pyramids in the Egyptian desert. This great bridge is built in people's hearts.</p>
<p>This is a bridge made of thoughts and emotions. Whoever has the confidence to build a bridge will build it in whose heart.</p>
<p>But this bridge is not ideal or perfect. Sometimes, when emotions flood the bridge surface, everyone knows that we can simply row a boat under the bridge, and the bridge will be bigger and wider.</p>
<p>The century of the people will be the century of bridge building. Good bridge builders will also be good people.</p>
<h3>Poetry Talk</h3>
<p>— Wu Tun Wu</p>
<p>The great French poet Chu Lexi said: "The person who wants to describe his dream must be particularly sober himself."</p>
<p>If the poet does not have his own muse of truth, goodness and beauty, does not have a pen as sharp as a sword and as red as fire, does not have a heart full of sorrow, resentment and anger, does not have the enthusiasm and dominance of life's struggle, or even does not have the proper limit of emotional stretching and empathy, then, what a ridiculous thing it is!</p>
<h3>Monkey and Man</h3>
<p>— Written by M. Gorky, Translated by Shi Heng</p>
<p>— One of the Russian Vignettes</p>
<p>Professor Z, a bacteriologist, once told me the following story.</p>
<p>"One day, I was talking to General B and accidentally mentioned that I wanted to find a monkey for an experiment. The general immediately said very seriously:</p>
<p>"How about Jews - are they not good? I have caught a few Jews here, spies who are about to be hanged - if they are useful to you, you are welcome to take them away."</p>
<p>Without waiting for my reply, he sent a messenger to see how many spies were waiting for execution.</p>
<p>"I tried to explain to the adult that humans are not suitable for my experiment, but he simply could not understand what I meant, and said with wide eyes:</p>
<p>"Yes, but humans are smarter than monkeys, aren't they? If you inject a person with poison, he will tell you all his feelings, but a monkey will not speak."</p>
<p>"At this time, the messenger walked in and reported that there was not a single Jew among the arrested spies - they were Romanians and Bohemians."</p>
<p>"How terrible!" the general said, "I don't think Bohemians are good either? ... How terrible! ..."</p>
<h3>The Philosophy of Love</h3>
<p>— Shelley, Translated by Tian Qin</p>
<p>The fountains mingle with the river</p>
<p>And the rivers with the ocean,</p>
<p>The winds of heaven mix for ever</p>
<p>With a sweet emotion;</p>
<p>Nothing in the world is single;</p>
<p>All things by a law divine</p>
<p>In one another’s being mingle—</p>
<p>Why not I with thine?</p>
<p>See! the mountains kiss high heaven,</p>
<p>And the waves clasp one another;</p>
<p>No sister-flower would be forgiven</p>
<p>If it disdain’d its brother;</p>
<p>And the sunlight clasps the earth,</p>
<p>And the moonbeams kiss the sea—</p>
<p>What are all these kissings worth,</p>
<p>If thou kiss not me?</p>
<h3>One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of Blood 160</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Seeing Hejian looking very anxious, I comforted him, saying, "Anxiety is useless. Anyway, 'Zero-One-Two' will definitely reply within ten hours, and the matter will be settled..."</p>
<p>"Got it!" Hejian, seemingly thinking about something, immediately jumped to the desk, grabbed a pen and started scribbling on the notebook on the desk, sheet after sheet. After a while, he finished writing, pressed the electric bell, called the orderly, and handed me the two written slips of paper to look at:</p>
<p>"Tokyo General Staff Headquarters Seventy-Two, Nakamura Pingzi, which group, which number? Nakajima Kaneko, which group, which number? Urgent reply, Zhiping, Two-One-Five."</p>
<p>Looking at the second sheet, it was the same telegram, but the recipient was "Shen General Headquarters One-Zero-Two." This "One-Zero-Two" was said to be our "Zero-Two," named He Shengtianta Lang, a very capable assistant. After reading these two telegrams, I knew that Hejian had shifted the "eight" secret from a geographical problem to a problem of people. After a while, our orderly took the telegrams away.</p>
<p>"Do you know?" Hejian asked me, "Nakajima Kaneko is the 'Manchurian Female Dog' in Pingzi's mouth... But this is just a guess. I don't believe this woman is so formidable. I suspect that the 'eight secret' is Pingzi herself!"</p>
<p>"Didn't she personally instruct you to pay attention to 'eight'? How can one deliberately ask people to pay attention to oneself?" I reminded him.</p>
<p>"Old brother, do you understand the word 'smoke screen'? Doesn't strategy say, 'The empty is the real, the real is the empty, the empty is empty and real, the real is real and empty, so that it cannot be predicted.' How do you know Pingzi isn't deliberately making trouble?"</p>
<p>"I also remembered a sentence. Didn't you intentionally want me to take a trip to Tokyo? Is it to deal with Pingzi?"</p>
<p>"You guessed it right." Hejian laughed, "You know, Pingzi is a China fanatic. She wants to learn Chinese and write Chinese poems, so she even gave herself a Chinese name called Liu Shi. At that time, I didn't quite understand her background. I thought she was just a female member of the Black Dragon Society, at most a spy. I took the opportunity to promote you a lot, saying that you are all-powerful and your mysterious guard is very deep..."</p>
<p>While Hejian was speaking, he paced around the room. Suddenly, he glanced at his watch, immediately jumped out of the door, pressed the electric bell, grabbed his hat, and shouted at me, "It's late, let's go, Lao Yue!"</p>
<p>"Where to?" I stared in surprise.</p>
<p>"Have you forgotten? It's five o'clock. Didn't you say that at five o'clock, you can go to Xiehe to see your friend from Changxindian, Engineer Wu Dingyuan?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I meant that every afternoon at five o'clock, the hospital allows relatives and friends of patients to visit. I didn't know you were going today."</p>
<p>"Let's go," Hejian commanded. "Anyway, there's nothing to do here. Besides, I'm very worried about him. It's a pity that such a good person was ruined by Japanese ruffians!"</p>
<p>I had just put cigarettes and other small items in my pocket and picked up my hat when Hejian was about to open the door. Coincidentally, someone knocked gently on the door twice. Hejian opened the door. I turned around and saw three people standing in a straight line at the door. The one at the front was Miss Ji Qun, who was as delicate as a flower but also heroic. She had taken off her military uniform and changed into a white-bottomed blue-flowered cheongsam, which highlighted the beauty of her femininity. I had never seen Pingzi, so I didn't know how beautiful she was. In my opinion, Ji Qun's appearance would not lose to Pingzi by half, perhaps even a little better.</p>

<h3>Political Common Sense American Trivia Thirteen Small Questions</h3>
<p>— Mengdie</p>
<p>Translated from this month's Reader's Digest</p>
<p>In the following dozen or so questions and answers, we can learn some interesting facts about the American government. The original text was published in the February issue of Reader's Digest, testing Americans' political common sense.</p>
<p>Q: Why does the American flag on the roof of Washington D.C. fly even at night?</p>
<p>A: This started during World War I. At that time, it was felt that there should be a building in the United States with a flag flying permanently on its roof. Washington D.C. was chosen because it is outside the jurisdiction of military regulations for raising and lowering the flag at sunset.</p>
<p>Q: How can you tell if the President is in the White House?</p>
<p>A: If the President is away overnight, the flag on the White House will be taken down.</p>
<p>Q: What is the "Conscience Fund" of the US Treasury?</p>
<p>A: When people intentionally or unintentionally defraud the government, they will anonymously send a sum of money to the "Conscience Fund" when their conscience discovers it.</p>
<p>Q: When did the US government move to the District of Columbia (abbreviated as D.C.)? From where did it move?</p>
<p>A: The US government moved from Philadelphia to D.C. in 1800.</p>
<p>Q: Why are there no tall buildings in Washington D.C.?</p>
<p>A: Congress stipulates that no building on Pennsylvania Avenue between 1st Street and 15th Street may exceed 160 feet, and others may not exceed 130 feet.</p>
<p>Q: How is a new state established?</p>
<p>A: Only Congress can allow a new state to join the Union.</p>
<p>Q: Where does the US national debt come from?</p>
<p>A: It was transferred from the thirteen-state congress of the revolutionary era in 1789.</p>
<p>Q: How does the "Congressional Record" differ from ordinary publications?</p>
<p>A: It is the only publication in the United States that is not subject to censorship. It is published daily, reporting on congressional developments. It is reprinted after being revised by the authorities when Congress is not in session.</p>
<p>Q: Can a person work for the government without compensation?</p>
<p>A: No, voluntary service is refused. The government asks people for help when necessary and pays them an annual fee.</p>
<p>White House History</p>
<p>Q: What is the oldest building in Washington D.C.?</p>
<p>A: It is the White House. Construction began in 1792, and it was not completed when it was occupied in 1800. It was rebuilt in 1815-17 after being damaged by the British.</p>
<p>Q: What is the difference between the "Term" and "Session" of Congress?</p>
<p>A: Each term of Congress begins on January 3 of each odd-numbered year, so each term is two years, regardless of the number of meetings. (This year, 1947, is the beginning of the 80th session of the US Congress.) A session refers to the convocation of the two houses of the legislature (or just the upper house) to handle affairs.</p>
<p>Q: What are the qualifications for being a member of the House of Representatives?</p>
<p>A: At least twenty-five years old, have been a US citizen for at least seven years, and must reside in the state he represents.</p>

<h3>A Smile Breaks the Face</h3>
<p>— Mai Jixian</p>
<p>An American politician once said: "If you want to be the President of the United States, you must first learn to smile." Yes, the late President Roosevelt always had a smiling face during his lifetime. In addition, the mayor of Wu Guo is said to always greet guests with a smile, so he not only earns people's "respect," but also their "love."</p>
<p>A liking for smiling faces is human nature. The stores we like are those where the staff greet us with a smile, the children we like are always those who laugh easily, and the friends we welcome are those who are cheerful and able to make everyone happy. In the mutual pleasure of men and women, laughter is the most important ingredient, because it can increase the man's kindness and the woman's charm.</p>
<p>Laughter is the medium for connecting hearts. "Looking at each other and smiling, forgetting each other in heart," what a touching situation. Many feuds and many disputes in the world are resolved by laughter. Moreover, laughter itself is a kind of beauty, and often, for the sake of one or two people's smiles, the whole room comes alive with spring. "A smile topples a city, another smile topples a country," the magic of laughter is evident here.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Even without offense, the face is hateful." People with hateful faces are those who do not understand the technique of smiling. There is also a saying: "There is no intention to reject people, but there is a color of rejection," presuming that it means a lack of inclination to smile.</p>
<p>Technically, the highest level of smiling is to make the other person smile at you. If you have this ability, whether you smile or not is no longer a question. There are many masters of humor in the world, such as Mark Twain, etc., or people who are good at socializing, and they can all make the other person laugh until they lean back and forth.</p>
<p>There are many difficult situations, awkward occasions, and sad things in the world that are alleviated and opened up by "laughter." For example, facing today's China, as ordinary people, they naturally have no choice but to smile; otherwise, what good would a grieving face do in reality? Being able to maintain a smile in extremely difficult circumstances, that kind of smile is a rare strength!</p>
<h3>Big and Small Have Problems It Just Depends on How You Solve Them</h3>
<p>— Written by Ernest Dichter, Translated and Abridged by Chen Xiang</p>
<p>We all have problems. We all suffer from emotional pain, fear, and disappointment. The purpose of this article is to help you recognize problems and solve smaller ones. We should all have sufficient psychological knowledge to solve simpler problems, just as everyone should know how to treat a cold and a headache.</p>
<p>Self-Consciousness</p>
<p>Everyone knows self-consciousness, which is perfectly normal. But if it seriously controls us, it becomes bad. A person who cannot speak in front of the boss, a bride whose tongue is tied in front of her mother-in-law, unpleasant shyness, even exaggerated, intimidating appearances—all are symptoms of self-consciousness.</p>
<p>If you are one of these people, what can you do? If it's not too serious, if you know how to do it, if you decide to do it, you can solve your problem yourself.</p>
<p>There was a young red-haired man who was acutely sensitive to his red hair. He didn't like it. He was convinced that his peers looked down on him for it. Soon, his red hair made him a bad self-conscious person.</p>
<p>One day, he noticed that a lecturer liked to mention him because he had red hair. He began to feel that being "different" might be an infinite advantage. So, he studied harder and became the best student in the class. Finally, he began to devote himself to "red," using his hair as a personal symbol. He studied and worked to make his career as prominent as his color. He succeeded—he solved the problem for himself.</p>
<p>The reason why this young man was able to solve his problem was because he was able to recognize the problem and turn harm into benefit.</p>
<p>Excessive Fear</p>
<p>We all have things we fear. Children fear things they don't love. They are afraid of the dark, water, or wild animals. Adults also have fears, although they may not openly express them.</p>
<p>There was a woman who was trained to be a singer, but she was paralyzed by a fear of the audience. Every time she was about to perform, she would have a cold, making her unable to go on stage—this was clearly a means of escape. After this happened several times, she recognized the trick her subconscious was playing. The next time, although she still had a fear of the audience, although her nose and throat were still constrained by the "cold," she forced herself to go on stage and sing. She refused the means of escape invented by her subconscious.</p>
<p>Finally, she overcame her phobia, and the "cold" no longer occurred. She mustered her courage and cured her difficulty.</p>
<h3>Natural Philosophy</h3>

<p>Paste</p>
<p>It always wants to bring people together, but it is squeezed into the cracks itself.</p>
<p>Glass Showcase</p>
<p>God creates the tragedy of life, and the glass showcase expresses the tragedy of life so succinctly. Many of the colorful things that people hope for in their hearts are hidden behind it, but they are unattainable.</p>
<p>High Tension</p>
<p>We all have our temperament, our emotions, and our decline. Usually, unpleasant temperaments do not last. We use simple courage—a secret to life.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this article is to give you the ability to help you solve smaller problems. If self-analysis can be of some use to you, you must accompany knowledge with some personal characteristics. Those characteristics are: courage to face the world and face yourself; an attitude of resistance to the world and to yourself; the ability to conquer problems; and the ability to take moderate offense.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you must put knowledge into practice. If you are unwilling to help yourself, even the best knowledge is useless.</p>
<h3>Chinese Textbook</h3>
<p>— Zhong Zhi</p>
<p>The newspaper reported: "The Chinese University textbook will be published by the two major bookstores, Zhengzhong and Commercial Press." Except for a group of young masters and misses who are proud of holding foreign books, who will take it lightly, all students who are sincerely learning will be overjoyed.</p>
<p>But there are a few points that we want to ask.</p>
<p>The first point to ask is: How fast? Don't see the news today and see the actual textbook five years later, then it's not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The second point to ask is: Is it used? Don't have a Chinese University textbook, but our professors still follow the same style, "Original" first!</p>
<p>The third point to ask is: Is it broad enough? Don't have many subjects missing, and students still have to rely on English books.</p>
<p>The fourth point to ask is: Is the terminology unified? Don't have multiple meanings for one term or multiple translations for one word, making it unclear.</p>
<p>If the university textbook can satisfactorily solve these points, we will not only celebrate for ourselves: From now on, China's new culture will be further promoted and developed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai is About to Collapse</h3>

<p>The Waibaidu Bridge has become a key thoroughfare for north-south traffic on the Suzhou River, but it has been in disrepair for years. After a detailed inspection by the Public Works Bureau, it was found that the bridge abutment had sunk and tilted, causing cracks, and the bureau has also formulated a rescue plan, preparing for processing and repairs. (See the report on the 31st of last month)</p>
<p>The tilting of the Waibaidu Bridge does not seem to be a recent event, as this phenomenon occurred several months ago; the reason for this is that the Broadway Mansion on the bridge approach is too heavy, causing the land to sink. As a result, the Waibaidu Bridge's footing is not solid, making it very easy to tilt.</p>
<p>If the Waibaidu Bridge is not repaired and left to its own devices, it is likely to collapse suddenly after a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>However, is the entire Shanghai not sinking all the time? Of course, the decline of education, economy, and other industries, as well as the recession of industry and commerce, are also contributing to the collapse of Shanghai's prosperity, and in fact, the ground in Shanghai is indeed sinking. It is said that since the Anti-Japanese War, the ground in Shanghai has sunk an average of eight or nine inches, and an average of nearly one inch per year; calculated in this way, if the land in Shanghai is more than fourteen feet higher than the Wusong Sea, Shanghai may become a swamp in more than one hundred and forty years.</p>
<p>Although more than one hundred and forty years seems to be too long for Shanghai people who pursue reality, the subsidence of the ground in various parts of the city is not uniform due to different loads and soil qualities, which has caused many buildings—International Hotel, Thirteen-Story Building, Broadway Mansion, etc.—to have a tendency to tilt, and the land will also be uneven due to different degrees of subsidence; if one of them suddenly collapses due to a large tilt, what will happen?</p>
<p>If the fate arranged by God cannot be changed by humans, in more than a hundred years, this prosperous international metropolis of Shanghai may become a gathering place for angelfish and the like, still allowing the fish and shrimp to live their leisurely maritime life, and only the upper half of the high-rise buildings that have always been envied will be exposed on the turbulent sea surface, allowing the people of that time to observe them as a historical miracle. But if "man can conquer nature," perhaps at that time, a dike higher than the Berlin Wall will have been built around Shanghai, and the sea water will be hitting the edge of the dike, allowing people to live in the depths of the seabed.</p>
<h3>Selling Live Eyes</h3>
<p>The illustration shows a 51-year-old woman from Pennsylvania, USA, with twelve children, who, unable to make a living, is willing to sell one of her live eyes to the highest bidder; the other one will also be sold upon her death. "This is for the future life of my good grandchildren," she said. The child in the picture is her five-month-old granddaughter. (Special contract with the New York Times)</p>
