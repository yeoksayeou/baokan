<h3>白崇禧發表書面談話　說明台善後措施　事變中盲從者准予保釋</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北一日電〕白崇禧一日下午五時假台北賓館舉行記者招待會，發表書面談話稱：關於台灣事變之善後措施，余已決定以下數項辦法，交由台省軍政主管機關執行。即：（一）逮捕人犯須依合法手續，（二）審理務求公允迅速，（三）遇有特殊重大案件，須呈國防部核准施行，（四）逮捕人犯應由警備總部統一辦理，（五）處決人犯應宣佈罪狀，當衆執行，以收殺一儆百之效。所有事變中捕獲在押之人犯，除共黨暴徒首要份子應依法嚴辦外，其餘肓從附和者，如情節輕微，即准具保開釋，在淸鄕期內，逮捕人犯亦一僅限於共黨首要暴徒，及私藏武器彈藥遲不繳出之人犯。再事變中因受共黨暴徒煽惑盲從之靑年學生，中央爲愛護此輩靑年，予以自新，以爲未來建省建國之幹部，一律從寬免究，祗須由其家長負責誥誡，率領到校，即准回校復課。現逃匿潛伏各處之共黨暴徒，如知悔悟，繳械投誠，亦當從寬處置。至此次專賣局查緝人員，非法傷斃人民一案，已催請當地司法機關從速判決，以昭大公。</p>
<h3>將向中央建議治理台灣措施</h3>
<p>白氏於其書面談話中又稱：對於今後治理台灣之措施，余擬向中央建議者略舉如下：政治方面：（一）改台灣行政長官公署爲省政府，為適應環境，將省府委員名額較他省略增，省府各廳處局增設副職，以便儘先選用台籍賢能人士，培養高級政治人才。（二）各縣市長准予定期民選，在準備未竣以前，應遴派地方賢能，富右資望人員充任爲原則。經濟方面：（一）台省重工業照中央規定，應歸國營或與省合營，並以由台民多數集資辦理爲原則，竭力避免爲合省內外少數資本家所壟斷或操縱。（二）台省公有土地即依昭台省公有土地放租辦法施行，將公有土地分配有耕種能力之台民耕種，以裕民生，而救濟失業台胞。（三）專賣制度按現行專賣物品，計有烟，酒，樟腦，火柴四種，樟腦係由省營，且並不普遍配銷，火柴原料均係仰給外來製品，產價亦並不大，現經與主管機關交換意見，擬將專賣局撤銷，另設烟酒公賣局。（四）貿易局擬即取銷，擬改爲類似物資供應局之機構，因省營工業成品外銷，或管之機構，至民營工業，亦可委託代辦。</p>

<h3>改革台省教育　亟應注意三點</h3>
<p>敎育方面，台灣同胞過去在日本統治五十餘年中，所受敎育，皆以學習日本語文爲主，現在敎育之改革，亟應首先注意以下諸項：（一）中央應選拔優秀師資來合辦理敎育，同時獎勵台籍學生赴內地求學，培養師資，促進文化交流。（二）社會敎育：查台省廣播事業較爲發達，全台有廣播收音機達十萬架，以上今後可由台省敎育主管機關作有計劃利甩廣播，普施社教，以便合胞學習，並提倡國語比賽，使語言與內地一致，以促進情感之團結。（三）利用電化敎育，凡電影片應注意選用富有民族思想愛國精神者，以激發合胞對國家觀念民族意識之增進，尤其對高山族同胞之敎育間題，更須加以注意。</p>
<p>白氏結語稱今後對於治理台灣方針，除注責政治與經濟之改進外，而敎育尤為根本，切盼內地來台之公敎人員，應本初衷，安心服務，並盼全合同胞一致精誠團結，與省外人士協力同心，爲建設台灣建設中國而努力。</p>

<h3>蘇聯應珍惜中國人民的友好感情</h3>
<p>英國外相貝文與美國國務卿卿歇爾元帥，對系蘇聯外長莫洛托夫於三月廿四日的一函，均已提出答覆了，貝文外相在其覆函中嚴正表示：英國對於中國恪守不干涉政策，並無代表駐在華北，故不能提供任何情報，馬帥的覆函雖未公佈，但據伙國新聞社莫斯科電稱，糧函內容，並無任何令人驚異之處，僅追述美國在華調處所作之努力，以及美軍撇離中國之情形而已。所以，蘇聯不論將發表任何聲明，但因莫洛托夫要求外長會議討論中國問題而引起國際上的波浪，從此也或可以告一段落了。</p>
<p>莫浴托夫在莫斯科外長會議開慕的第一日，就提州建議，要求外長會議討論中國問題，不僅引起中國人民的憤慨，而且也使各國正義感的人士表示不平；這們跡近悔辱中國的建議，當非英美兩國外長所能接受，貝文外相乃提出折衷辦法，主張中國問題由英美蘇三國外長，在會外作非正式的討綸；同時馬帥也堅特其一貫的主張，苟無中國代表參加，卽不能討論中國問題，莫洛托夫至此也深知其建議的毫無理性，不得不看風轉篷，放棄了他原來的建講，而致面貝文外相與馬帥，贊成由英美蘇三國外長在會外非正式討論中國問題，對於由中國派遺代表參加一議，亦表示同意。但是中國政府，鑒於國內內政不容他國干涉，叉於十四日經由外交途徑，向英美法蘇四強鄭重聲明，無論在會內會外討論中國問題，中國決不派遣代表參加。於是英美蘇三國對於討論中國問題所成立的祕議，又為中國政府的嚴正聲明所打銷了。貝文外相與馬帥爰乃函覆莫洛托夫，一致表示反對在會內或會外討論中國問題，惟馬帥又提出一種折衷辦法，主脹英美蘇三國外長在四月一日以前，被此以書面互相交換關於中國之情報，並以副本一份送達中國。莫洛托夫深感孤掌難鳴，對於馬帥的建議，也不得不表示同意，並於廿四日致函貝文外相與馬帥，一方面表示贊同馬帥的建講，在四月一日以前彼此以書面互相交換關於中國的情報，並以副本一份送達中國政府；但在另一方面仍表示對於此種界序不能完全滿意，仍希望討論中國問題。貝文外相接兩後立即發表聲明：英國不能提供任何情報：馬帥的覆立函也已提山，內容可望於日內發表。據悉蘇聯對此，不甚滿意，但是無論如何，因莫洛托夫要求討論中國問題而在國際上所引起的波浪，終可視為告一段落了。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫要求四國外長會議討諭中國問題無諭如何曲意解釋，對於中國終是一大侮辱，有損於中國的尊嚴及光榮，中國人民的怒吼，並向蘇聯表示抗議，賓為人民憂國心的一種自然流露，我們在軍情憤慨時發言或撰文，終不免感情用事，而流於過激；但是在現在，平心靜氣，回想過去，仍覺得感喟萬端。</p>
<p>第一，莫洛托夫的舉，在其本身而言，固然懷有極大的作用，一方面，想打擊中國的地位以刺激中國人民；而另一方面又企圖對美國採取先發制人的外交攻勢，作為取得美國對於別稱問題讓步的條件。但是莫洛托夫的外交攻勢，事實證明終於失敗了。莫洛托夫不僅弄巧成拙，而且「先倨後恭」實在有朱外交家的風度。我們終覺得戰援的蘇聯外交，處處肥看同樣的錯誤，給予世人一個懸劣的印象，而一致認為蘇聯是重權益而輕信義的國家，這種現實主義的作風，足以妨害各國與蘇聯的合作，因為國際社會，有如人類社會，大家所願交結的朋友，當然是最重視信義的人；反之，若不講究信義，而處處唯利是圖，則人人均將遠而避之，不敢與共接近，社會上鬧到衆叛親離的，大半是不講信義的人。所以我們要奉勸莫洛托夫，蘇聯如果是真正愛好和平而欲領導世界各國締造和平的國家、則蘇聯恢複其在國祭上的信義實在是萬不可缺少的先決條件。</p>
<p>第二，戰後的蘇聯外交，到處採取先發制人的姿態，在蘇聯言，自以為是處於主動地位，可以進退裕如，但是進種外交作風，最容易打破國際上的和諧空氣，莫洛托夫向國際上投擲炸彈，不惜引起軒然大波，並不是自今日始；在歷屆國際會議中，莫洛托夫動輒予人以難堪，也非這次對待中國始，所以我們認為戰後國際局勢酌動量不安，蘇聯外交不顧全大局，常常輕舉妄動，不能不負相當的責往。蘇聯報衹常常自詡詡：蘇聯是眞正蔆好和平的國家，對於締造世界和平的貢獻最大，我們固不願掃蘇聯人民的興，表示異議：但願蘇聯今後確能處處以國際安全與世界和平為重。</p>
<p>第三，英國外相貝文和美國物卿歇爾，在的姿態在聯聯言自以為是處於主地地位，可私時精碎，實在令人欽佩︰自始至終，堅特着他們一貫的正義主張，尤為我們中國人民所感激木盡。</p>
<p>第四，我們對於蘇聯，不僅沒有成見，而且很顯意與蘇聯為友，我國不惜任何代價，與蘇聯締結中蘇友好及同盟條約，就是一個絕好的證明。這次我國人民頁蘇聯抗議示威，並不是－種反蘇運動，而僅是反對莫洛托夫在外長會讓中提出侮辱中國的建議而已。現在這個波浪旣已成為過去，莫洛托夫也已知自己弄巧成拙，步步退讓，我們婁不能再感情用事，永遠懷恨在心，所以我們仍希望在中蘇之間，經過一次的風波之從，反而能趨於密切友好。我們對於蘇聯，別無所求，但願蘇聯能切實履行中蘇盟約，將大連放順交由中國政府接收，就是蘇聯是否履行盟約的一大考騐。</p>
<p>要之，蘇聯對於中國問題所當發表的聲明，我們雖然尚未閱及；但是無論如何，蘇聯對於我們四萬五千萬人民的友好感情，終不能不特別重視的。而蘇聯要惜珍中國人民的友好感情，並不是一件難事，只要莫洛托夫能接受過去的敎訓，立卽改變外交作風，中蘇關係的新頁，立郎就可以展開我們的眼前。</p>

<h3>馬歇爾重申美國立場　堅持德國經濟統一　反對自德生產中提取賠償</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦一日廣播莫斯科訊：美國要求蘇聯開始對德國問題讓步，否則將無限期展緩對德和的之談判。今日四國外長初决在此間舉行非正式會議時，莫洛托夫將利用此時機，透露蘇聯之答覆。</p>
<p>〔合衆社莫斯科一日電〕此間英美方面均認爲馬歇爾之演說，將成爲會議之轉捩點，然蘇報對之仍保緘默。一向爲蘇報攻擊目標之馬歇爾共和黨顧問杜勒斯，自動請求不出席今日之非正式會議。各觀察家咸認此事之意義重大。蓋欲盡力避免對蘇聯之刺激，以爭取其可能之讓步。隨同馬歇爾出席今日非正式會議之顧問爲史密斯大使與柯漢兩人。</p>
<p>〔路透社莫斯科卅一日電〕外長會議今日開會時，美國務卿馬歇爾重申美國反對分割德國之意。渠謂使德國永遠分裂，對馬歐洲及世界和平均有危險，且分裂的德國，意即分裂的歐洲，美國之主張使德國統一，即爲不欲歐洲分裂之故。馬歇爾復對蘇聯之提取德工業出品作爲賠償，並以之作爲接受經濟統一原則之條件，表示遺憾，渠謂波茨坦協定並未規定此等條件，美國亦堅決反對此一條件，渠覺蘇聯似有將「一馬出售二次」之企圖。馬歇爾繼曰，關於進出口計劃及財政協定，各國已在原則上承認其需要，但四强尚須議定，實施政治及經濟統一之協定，必須同意設立中央行政機構德國臨時政府，同意居民貨物及主義在德國境內之自由移動，廢止區與區問之壁壘，並分擔各區預算暫時性的差額。馬歇爾並聲明於協定成立後，必須一體遵從，不能再如波茨坦協定之僅有部份被實施。與其有協定而不能施行，不如根本不訂協定，總之，實行波茨坦協定之情形，決不尤其重演。馬歇爾繼述及法國所提關於煤斤之條件，渠謂法國並非波茨坦協定之一份子，故不能視其要求爲談判之條件。馬歇爾繼又槪述美國代表團之立塲，申明擁護以足使德人維持生存爲原則，訂立平衡進出口之計劃，提高德國工業水準，使德國工廠生產合乎歐洲需要等。美國之支持德國經濟統一之原則，乃爲不欲使德國分裂，分裂的德國必致形成每區各自爲政之局面，卒至形成堅強之兩部，一旦合併即又成爲軍權主義的德國。</p>
<p>法外長皮杜爾繼辯述煤斤問題及薩爾區未來與德國經濟統一之關係，渠認外長會在未曾決定德國煤斤出口量及本國所得消費量以前，不能決定工業之水準，賠償之標準及經濟之統一，而薩爾區是否應併入法國經濟範圍未獲決定前，亦不能決定德經濟統一之問題。皮杜爾並要求於討論德國工業水準時，再檢討以德國工業出品作爲賠償之可能性。</p>
<h3>英揭櫫四項原則</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社電〕最後由貝文外相就德國經濟統一提出四項原則，此即（一）人民商品及思想之流動自由；（二）平衡進出口貿易，俾出口貿易能抵銷進口貿易；（三）四佔領國家共同分担佔領之負担；（國）設立德國中央行政機構，賦予執行權力。　貝文外相稱，英國對於自德國現行生產中提取賠款，四强共管魯爾區，以及取消英美佔領區經濟合併仍表示反對。英國贊成薩爾區在經濟上與法國合併，但對於德國煤斤輸往法國之任何正式協定則表示異議。　四國外長定明日舉行秘密會議，賡續討論德國經濟統一問題，與工業水準問題。</p>
<h3>專家委員會討論　德次要問題</h3>
<p>四國意見依然紛歧</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社莫斯科卅一日電〕四國外長會議所設立之專家委員會，負責研究對德和約所有之决要問題，本日開會，各國意見仍極紛歧，與四國對於各重要問題意見相左之情形初無二。緣四國代表本日在專家委員會席上，曾就肅淸納粹人及德政治民主化兩項問題，徹底交換意見，關法國堅持德政黨及工會其範圍應以各省爲限，而非全國性之政黨及工會。美國願各黨自由競爭，由各政黨領袖各自負責，至於工會在金融上亦須獨立。關於選舉制度，蘇聯堅持其採取比例代表制之要求，但無論如何，專家委員會至明日須如期完成其任務。</p>
<h3>英政府發表　三協定條文</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦卅一日電〕外務部頃發表白皮書，將一九四三年七二月之德黑蘭協定，一九四五年二月之雅爾達協定，及一九四五年七月之波茨坦協定予以發表。</p>
<h3>英蘇修改盟約　談判進行中</h3>

<p>〔聯合社日內瓦卅一日電〕國際衛生機構臨時委員會今日已接辦聯合國救濟總將之對華衛生工作。</p>
<h3>希臘王國暴保羅親王繼承大統</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦一日廣播：希臘國王喬治二世今日突因心病暴斃，亨年五十六歲，其弟保羅親王將於今日下午七時三十分（雅典時間）繼承王位。喬治二世曾二次被逐出國境，甫於去年在公民投票以後重登王位。當時希臘共產黨對公民投票極力攻擊，認爲不能代表民意，但英美代表則全力支持之。希王之死使尚在討論中之美國援希問題，獲一新的發展</p>
<p>〔聯合社雅典一日電〕據希臘左翼領袖稱，英美政府均承認希臘現政府不甚健全，除非杜魯門總統乘此機會，促使希政府改革，否則喬治逝世，於大局並無變動。華盛頓方面美參院外交委員會委員喬琪稱，希王暴崩，美國援希程序不應因而更改。假定希臘能組成穩健政府，則希王逝世，在若干方面或能帮助程序進行云。</p>
<h3>英阿糾紛案　將提交海牙法庭</h3>
<p>〔法國新開社成功湖卅一日電〕英國某要員今日透露：安理會英代表團已提議將英國與阿爾巴尼亞糾紛案，提出海牙國際法庭甲訴。查英國控訴阿爾巴尼亞在柯孚海峽敷水雷一案，仍留在安理會議程中，但因上星期蘇聯對此問題運用否決權，故此一問題非俟太平洋舊日本代管島問題解決後，不致恢復加以討論。英國人士則謂安理會對此問題不能取決，則提出國際法庭完全合於邏輯。</p>

<h3>關於美援助希土計劃　范登堡提修正案　旨在調和美國對聯合國關係</h3>
<p>〔聯合華盛頓卅一日電〕共和黨參議院外交委員會主席范登堡今日對杜魯門總統四億美元援助希臘土耳其方案，提出三種一節制辦法。其中一項規定聯合國機構有權制止次種援助，但蘇聯不得利用否決權，以妨碍美國之行動，聯合國機構若欲阻止，必須由安全理事會或聯合國大會，視作程序問題而非實質問題加以表決。換言之，即安理會十一理事中，應有七席之多數，五常任理事國之否決權不適用。聯合國大會方面此種表決，五十五票中應有二十八票多數。范氏並向報界宣稱，渠提出此稱修正案，無非欲表明美國擬在聯合國機構精神內行動。事實上，范氏之提案，等於美國在援助希土計劃遭遇任何阻碍時，願意放棄其表決權。安全理事會對於「實質」問題之表決，須五大國全體一致，各該國得行使否決權。依照范氏之意，美國願服從大多數之表決，即使違反美國之決策，亦所不顧。美國倘請聯合國機構本身決定援助希臘土耳其，則蘇聯或其他大國可用否決權加以制止。共和黨參議員塔虎特贊成范氏此項修正案，民主黨參議員喬治稱之爲「方向正當之一步驟」。范氏條正案並規定總統於下列兩種情形下應撤消對希臘土耳其之全部或任何援助，即：（一）希臘或土耳其任何一國政府有此要求，惟此種政府應代表該國多數派；（二）總統倘發現援助目標為，大致已告完成或無法完成。共和黨眾議員克勞馥則在衆議院外交委員會稱，美國應正告蘇聯務必解除武裝，否則美國不惜以原子彈與經濟力加以對付。蘇聯若有意作梗，等於開戰，戰爭倘若發生，蘇聯將受痛擊云。</p>
<h3>英徇美國之請繼續援助希臘</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦卅一日電〕〕頃自此間負責方面獲悉，英國援助希臘計劃，原定本日結束，茲徇美國之請，繼續援助希臘，直至美國之援助希臘發生效力時為止。美國援希法案尙在國會討論中，倫敦人士希望此項計劃產於四月底以前在美國國會通過。至於英國之過渡時期之援助，應儘量縮小範圍，官方人士確　　種援　不致有任何軍事性質。</p>
<h3>美駐南波葡三國　新大使人選</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓卅一日電〕杜魯門總統今日提名任命甘農氏為美國駐南斯拉夫大使，維來為駐葡萄牙大使，葛里芬爲駐波大使</p>
<h3>關於進口限制事　瑞典答覆美抗議</h3>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓卅一日電〕美國前為瑞典頒布進口限制，向其提出抗議，瑞典之覆文業已遞達國務院。據探悉覆文措辭尙屬緩和，但力言自一九三五年對美互惠商約成立以來，局勢已有積極的變更，瑞典表示在實施一般進口限制時，對於美國決無歧視，並願與美政府談判關於實施進口限制辦法之問題。</p>
<h3>弗朗哥突然宣布　西班牙為君主國　並聲明渠將終身　為西班牙元首</h3>
<p>〔路透社倫敦一日電〕馬德里電台昨夜廣播弗朗哥將軍之演說，宣布西班牙爲君主國，弗朗哥將爲元首，此外並設攝政團。按西班牙上次之君主政體係於一九三一年終止，該年西班牙各較大城市市議會塲贊成改立共和，國王亞方索十三世乃遜位出國，此後即從未返國。馬德里電台今日並宣布君主政體之法案，宣布西班牙爲王國，國家之領袖名日元自。並謂攝政團應協助元首，處理一切事務。攝政團由全國總主敎或最有名望之大主敎會同參謀聽長。國務會議議長。最高法院院長。西班牙研究院院長等組成之，此外代表工會。地方行政。一大學校長。及職業學院之議會議員，每組得推選代表一人，參加攝政團。該法案復明白規定在弗朗哥未死或未曾喪失其能力以前，決不另立國王。又謂；元首於死亡或喪失能力時，得由攝政團及政府之建議，經議會三分之二之同意，立王族血統之人為元首，若未有符合此等條件之人，或其提名爲議會所否決，得立攝政以代元首。</p>
<h3>西蒂制派　表示反對</h3>
<p>〔合衆社馬德里一日電〕西帝制派對弗朗哥計劃，認爲完全「不能接受」。渠等不以爲然之理由爲：（一）限制元首之資格；（二）保存帝制派所欲剷除之現議會及長槍會之實權；（三）此一計劃使弗朗哥之任期無限延長。渠等又稱：該一計劃之起草目的，實爲防止帝制派之直接策動，完成復辟，而保體弗朗哥繼續操大權在手。</p>
<h3>英美反響多表不滿</h3>
<p>〔合眾社華盛頓一日電〕關於弗朋哥對西班牙之聲明，美國務部不願置評。據某外交家意見，如西陸軍決定恢復西帝制時期到來，作為軍人之弗朗哥，應服從命令，因陸軍在西內戰時，指定渠爲領袖。該外交家又稱：如情形果屬如此，帝制恢復始有可能，因盟國在大戰中勝利，使陸軍有壓倒長槍會之優勢。</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦一日電〕外交部發言人稱：「西班牙之政體須由人民自由加以決定而不能因弗朗」哥所强制。惟有弗朗哥與其政權消除後，英國才能對西班牙採取妥協態度。」</p>

<p>〔聯合社倫敦卅一日電〕邱吉爾今日領導保守黨擁護首相艾德禮彈壓工黨內部反對延長兵役法至一九五四年之叛動。邱翁宣稱，此次吾人擁護政府，工黨領袖抵拒黨中陰謀與腐敗份子所表現之勇氣，吾人極爲讚美。按工黨議員七十七人為反對兵役法起目，已提出議案，要求加以廢止。艾氏今晨在工黨議員秘密會議籲請黨內團結。但消息靈通人士稱，仍有黨員四五十人，將投票反對延長兵役法。該法規定每年徽召十八歲至二十六歲之壯丁二十萬人，在陸海空軍服役。勞工部長伊薩克今日在下院展開辯論，謂英國兵力已减少至嚴重階段，力主通過此案，以資挽救。並謂「除非吾人採取若干步驟彌補此缺陷，則吾人將處於極困難之境地」。辯論以兩日為期，明日夜間付表決。</p>

<h3>霍奇已返抵漢城　朝鮮美蘇佔領區間困難眾多</h3>

<h3>前法公董局賬冊已失　華員儲蓄金計算困難　清理委會法租界小組昨會議</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕上海市前工部局公董局官有資產與義務債務淸理委員會法租界小組，於昨日下午在地政局召開第五次會議。出席祝平·查良鑑·張翼樞。簫建榮·孫逵方·法人葛勵德·托芬·顧瑞良·摩理神父。列席楊作膺及法方薛華禮等多人。席間商討前法公董局華籍職員儲蓄金發還問題，尚未獲得結果。據悉：此一前公董局華籍職員儲蓄金問題，與工部局部份不同。工部局部份有賬册可查，而公董局則賬册至今不知下落。據一九三一年七月八日法公董局華員儲蓄會章程所載，儲蓄金係自職員每月薪金中扣存百分之五，由公董局津貼月薪額百分之五，此外尚付利息。依此章程字面解釋，當有一筆款項存在。惟據法方聲稱：華籍職工之儲蓄會，與歐籍職工之儲蓄會不同，後者爲一自主組織，收受公釐局之津貼及職工所繳之款，並將款項存放銀行，準備於退職時付款。惟華籍職工之儲蓄金，則並無任何特別組織，所繳之款概由公董局自行記賬而担承於付款時加給每年於通過預算時所規定之利率應得之息金。公董局董事會於每年議決預算時，當規定儲蓄會在次年所得之利率云云。小組會現承認對前公董局華員所負之債務，但欲查明該項儲蓄金當時是否扣存，如係扣存，則此款項現存何處。現所感煩惱者，即有關該項法公董局之賬册已無存。法方稱已移交僞府，但勝利後市府並未接收得該項卷宗。據小組會息，如確定當時並無扣存，則當籌款償還。然後當開始討論及償還倍數及計算日期云。</p>

<h3>服務讀者諮詢　法律質疑</h3>
<p>（一）私拆信件</p>
<p>浦頭永康號問　敝號於去年十月六日接獲自口岸全行某字號寄來要函一件，收到時發覺該函已被他人偷拆。常即往代轉該函之某代辦所交涉，該號職員直認不諱。茲有法律問題收則請賜答（一）該所苛收郵資，强索送力，是否遠法？（二）私拆他人信件，是否遠法。（三）該所送信班次不一，往往藉故故稽延，是否遠法？</p>
<p>（曹亞俠律師答〕（一）苛收郵資，勒取送力，如果屬實，則除違反郵政章則外，並涉有刑事嫌疑。觸犯刑法，詐欺及瀆職等罪，並屬懲治貪污條例第三條第五款之「利用職務上之機會詐取財物』之行爲。（二）私拆信件，郵政法第四十一條規定。依刑法第三百十五條處斷</p>
<p>（三）可向主管郵局告發。依照郵政代辦所規則第五條規定，代辦人如有辨理不善，或違犯章則情事。應即予撤換，其涉有刑事嫌疑者，並應送請司法機關審理之。</p>
<p>押租問題</p>
<p>十年讀者問人於民國二十四年向人質得房屋一所訂明租期六年。押租銀幣二百元，每月房租四元五角。迨民國三十年租賃期滿，又訂續租五載，押租照舊，不加租金，每月加作十元。旋更加作爲中諸券十五元，再加爲飯米二，以迄於今。茲以年限巳滿有下列數問題敬懇賜答；</p>
<p>（一）退租時當時之押租二百元應照何種比例歸還方爲合理，可吾照當時米價折還？</p>
<p>（二）如要求依照生活指數之比例歸還是否合理？</p>
<p>（三）可否與房主洽商照廿四年訂的時之房金每月四元五角計算再續續居住數年至押租住淸爲止，合法吾？</p>
<p>〔曹亞俠律師答〕（一）不可，因當時所付非「米」。（二）現行法並無以依照生活指數比例增加返還之規定。（三）押租非預付之租金，而程賈物因價值之昇降，其租金得隨時增减之，租賃定有期限者，其租賃關係於期限屆滿時消減，法有明文規定、今欲以十餘年前之租金數額計算，而住清所付之押租，並不合法。</p>

<h3>正大學潮未澄清　一切均移部解決　學生昨先復課靜待後命</h3>
<p>〔本報南昌一日電〕正大學潮，尚未屆澄淸之候，一切均移部解決。學生昨日先復課，惟靜待後命，一月爲期。護校會頃宣稱繼續護校工作，非達目的，決不終止。敎部專員程其保即返京復命，據談：正大學潮，內情複雜，調處費事，現雖復課，前途仍難樂觀。程氏又稱：校內設備簡陋，固屬事實，然以成立六載，幾經搬遷，能有今日規模，亦屬不易，今後必須另籌鉅資，方能從事充實內部設備。</p>
<h3>滬江大學學生組織　校政革新運動委會　分函家長說明自由出入理由　又向校方提出取消積點制度</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕滬江大學罷誤風潮，昨仍僵持中。學生方面堅持不獲結果，決不復課，對於前日校董會議決：「自由出入校門一點，原則ｈ　可予接受，惟須待多數家長同意」一節，學生方面仍未能滿意，因恐多數家長不明暸學校內幕，而予以反對，且信件往返需時甚久，學生均有急不及待之感。該校學生組織校政革新運動委員會。爲爭取家長之同情，已由該委會於昨日分兩各學生家長，詳述此次校方處罰政治系同學金家麟私出校門之不當，及全體同學罷課經過情形，希望家長能寄予同情，並予援助。原函對學生可以自由出入校門一節，並說明理由云：「學校在上課時，每次都點名，對於曠課，學校已有嚴格的處罰辦法，我們的要求自由出入，決不會影嚮到我們的上課，只是要求在無課的時候，能够自由出入，而且要在晚上九時以前回到宿舍，決不致有不良的後果，請各位賢明的家長完全放心。」</p>

<h3>為國定教科書敬復鄧恭三先生（上）</h3>
<p>— 陸殿揚</p>
<p>三十六年一月二十六日上海大公報刋載鄧恭三先生的星期諭文，對於部編敎科書指摘甚多，足資警惕；但其所論各點，似應看所說明，以免誤會。一　綜觀鄧先生全文，除設罵部分不必辯論外，約可分爲三類：（一）暫行本誤排失校及措辭欠妥之處，或已於修訂本或滬版本中改正而鄧先生朱見，或修訂本爲七聯處延誤，正在排印而尚未出版，致未及供應；（二）問題屬於課程標準而不在敎科書者；（三）鄧先生之主張是否妥善，大可商榷者。茲分述於下：</p>
<p>（一）暫行本誤排欠妥之處，在修訂本由大致修正，例如高小國語修訂本第三册第一課業已改正爲「甲午之戰，我國職敗，人心憤激」。初中國文，歷史兩科修訂木，於上年五月以前發排，迄未出版，以致各校繼續沿用暫行本，誠爲遣憾！惟滬版暫行本，已將若干誤字改正，略勝一籌。鄧先生所舉各點，在修訂本中固已改正，原稿在七聯處排版中，可以復按，即在滬版暫行本中，亦已改正一部分，例如鄧先生所舉的宋代宗澤，李綱「堅守和議」，在滬版暫行本第三册第四十五面第九行已改正爲「譬如在宋，遼，金，戰役中，寇準，李綱，宗澤，都能堅拒和議，剛正不阿，而韓世忠，岳飛的艱苦奮鬥，更不用說了」，渝版本漏一「金」字，又「拒」誤爲「守」，致意相反，但觀下句，即可證明李等爲拒和而非守和之人。又如西遼的「耶律達什」與「耶律大石」，元代的丞相「託克託」與「脫脫」，原均爲音譯名詞，在譯名未統一以前，各書所載容有不同，但在滬版本中「耶律達什」均已改用「耶律大石」，見第三册第七面末第二行及第五十面第四行，在修訂本中「託克託」亦均已改爲「脫脫」。又如鄧先生所舉的秦始皇焚書坑儒一節，在滬版本中早已修改爲「……一切史書和詩書，百家語完全焚毀，所不去者，醫，藥，卜，筮，種樹之書，如人民欲學法令，可奉吏爲師，傳說焚書之後，又曾坑儒士數百人於咸陽，滬就是始皇焚書坑儒的兩大公案」，見滬版木第一册第八十七面第五行至第八行。在修訂本中更己將木課末段删去，對於焚書坑儒一節改爲「但是始皇爲祈求統一太念切，其舉措設施便流於專制，甚至有焚書坑儒之舉」等語。又如初中歷史第三册元明的社會一課中「元世祖提倡農業」句「世祖」誤排為「太祖」，修訂本中亦已校正，其餘渝版暫行本初中歷史之誤字，在滬版暫行木中業已改正不少，在修訂本中更有大部的修正之處。希望各校購書時，注意購用修訂本，最爲妥善！</p>

<h3>收購茶葉決予停止　允許茶商再加押款　本年度茶貸總額四聯業已核定</h3>
<p>自財政部對收購茶葉之盈虧，國庫無此項預算，不能負担之消息發表後，國行商訂打包放款及外銷辦法，己失效用，經通日茶商代表向關行及中農銀行互相交換意見之結果，昨晚方始獲得新決定：政府決取消收購，此後當由茶商努力經營外銷，謀加緊新茶生產，國行已允許茶商再加押款，以資週轉。其額度以本年新茶預定押款價格八折為標凖，即祁紅爲四十八萬元，（原爲卅五萬元）屯綠四十萬元，（原爲廿八萬元）平綠卅二萬元，（原爲廿萬元）總計加押款項，約值數十億元之多。對於農村經濟，自可靈活，並悉，上項辦法呈報四聯總處核定後，即予實施。</p>
<p>又訊，四聯總處日航舉行第三二〇次會議，核定本年度茶貸方案，貸放區域爲浙皖閩籍鄂等省，較上年爲普遍，其總額的八百億元。較去春增加幾達十倍，貸款以加工爲記點，繼以運銷及出口地點押款，目的在吸引游資納入農村，致力生產，並促其加連精製成箱運銷出口，換取外匯。按去年度箱茶，如汪裕泰。華茶，久興，興華，大德昌，振中，中南等家，雖經陸隨外銷，然滯積上海爲數仍多，貸款迄今幾將一年，以製遝運延，外銷萎疲，對生產資金之營運，殊欠靈活，本年茶貸深望於五個月內完成外銷，以謀茶葉業之進展。</p>
<p>本年茶貸方案，業經四聯總處核定，其目的全在扶持茶商出口，爭取外匯，平衡國際收支，故數字較去年增加十倍，而湘鄂贛等產茶區，均一律辦理，以期普遍，從加工運銷出口等過程，茶商均可獲得貸款，加工時期之貸款，辦理遝銷貸款時，即子扣除，運銷階段之貸款，出口押匯時，即予扣除，俾是項貸款，發生循環使用之效力，因此，此外茶貸共分三個階段，分別辦理，第一步為加工貸款，共計二百七十餘億，第二步運銷貸款不，共計為五百餘億，第三步出口押匯，共計爲八百餘億，均係針對茶商實際需要而訂定者，以平均每担四十萬元，計本年度可輸出茶葉二十五萬担，（茶商資金除外）該行爲減低至葉成本，節省開支起見，特規定各茶廠，每年產量，至低在一百担以上，始有申請加工貸款資格，其不滿一百祖者，可由數家茶廠聯合組織合作茶廠，凑呈百担數字，否則難望核准，加工貸款，本月中旬即可開始辦理，合作茶廠如以時間過迫，一俟組織就緒後，亦可補行申請。</p>
<h3>華股市況疲怯　臨收數分鐘內忽稍扳高　火柴中紡有一送九之說</h3>
<p>華股昨銀根告緊，人心渙散，形成供過於求，大部份時賈在怯疲中過去。低價後籌碼漸緊，補空稍殷，臨收時數分鏡內，忽稍扳高。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>除美亞外，餘均見低。開後還永紗由一二九號一九七號二九號一三四號二一八號乘低咸補，逐漸盤升至二三五〇元。一三七號一四五號一儿八號二一九號二三五號七八號二二號日七號均來脫手，回跌至二二五〇元光景。美亞由一九九號二二三號等收買，獨放異彩，由低步高，遞永紗亦經六五號二二三號一八〇號等進至二三〇〇元外。經過數度盤旋後，六〇號二二六號一四號一八五號二〇二號冉來購買，賈有補空，曾回漲到二三四〇元。十一時一刻後，當局復有查究對請電話之舉，二二號二三五號六九號一四五號一五三號一五六號一四二號連袂脫售，近午忽形不支，而退至二二三〇元。惟火柴中紡在一送九之利買增資傳說下，反見向榮。結果較前收計永紗信和新光勸興新華各跌半成光景，景福增資失望，散多均售，獨跌一成弱，中法亦然。華豐微降，美亞微升。遞交計永紗信和景福各低半成弱，華豐美亞微降，新光跌半成强，冷股大通永公跌一成左右，榮豐火柴麗安微升，中紡水泥平平，餘微挫迄跌半成强不等。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>一八五號一二五號一五六號俱售，匯永紗自一三三〇元開後降至二二〇〇元。一七一號二一八號一五五號趁低維持，略有微升，一九八號八九號二二三號四七號一四五號一八〇號二三一號二三五號俱賣，乃盤低至二一八〇元。二一九號一〇六號一七號六一號七六號一二五號一五六號一四號二八號二〇七號紛購，逐漸拉高，在臨收時數分鐘買氣忽盛，而以高價結束，收後喊價微高，結果較前收計景福慘跌一成强，永紗信和華豐新光勤興中法新華各跌半成强，美亞微挫，遞交計永紗信和微降，新光華　景福各跌半成，美亞微升，冷股榮體國貨麗安水泥平穩，餘均微挫迄跌半成强不等，塲外各股除閘北屹然未動，餘均見降。</p>
<h3>統債平疲</h3>
<p>公債昨以大戶陳某之力拋，上塲見疲。但新賈尚來活動，疲後容易回上。統丙晨開一一五〇〇元，即退至一〇五〇〇元，在一一〇〇〇元至一二〇〇〇元間頗費掙扎。十一時後始回升至一三五〇〇元而後轉盛，結果較前收計雜牌尚平，統丙明升一千四，成交不過八百萬元。午後塲外喊低至一二〇〇〇元以下。</p>
<h3>外股轉呈盤局</h3>
<p>外股昨說氣已减，轉呈盤局。怡紗晨初二七六〇〇元高價，即遭浮多及廣帮了結而步降至二六五〇〇元。午刻有銀行帮微納而轉穩，午後形勢更平，缺乏特變。結果較前收計鋼業跌一成，航業紙業各降半成，餘均微挫。</p>
<h3>食糧店方有進　秈米去化見俏</h3>
<p>昨日南北市共到米糧一萬二千五百餘石，久疲之後，店方業巧進納，中下早薄稻略呈活絡，北粳趨勢亦成堅定之格，秈米去化見俏，白元陰元則鮮有變化。　麵粉本粉供求仍頗平衡，暫乏變動，惟洋粉消化活靈，續昂千元。麩皮去化甚呆，平平之態。豆餅客帮銷路平常，惟廠方以原料昂貴，售心頗堅，微升一二百元。</p>
<p>黃豆到源仍稀，消胃尚可，明定暗緊，帶升千元。菉豆彷彿，赤豆南洋續辦，到不敵銷，步砌二三千元。苞米酒精廠納取，加一二千元。紅糧挺立，生仁洋莊略有問津，成定勢之狀。芝蔴仍然穩固，蠶豆挺秀。　油市外埠去化雖然不動，奈本街零星實銷尚殷，來貨仍稀。生油續漲二三千，蔴　步升三五千元，淸油豆油繼續猛漲萬元，午時收盤略見平正。</p>
<h3>人造絲激漲</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局本週對絲織業人造絲之配售，迄昨日仍未配出。又對絲織聯營公司之配貨，亦未如期交出。故人造絲市况，遂告騰漲。昨日上午一百廿號高山，自六百十五萬元，高漲至大百廿五萬元。下午更喊高至六百六十萬元，尚少售戶。平均較昨日軋漲四十五萬元。</p>
<h3>銀樓大同行十七家復業　兌出較收進為多</h3>
<p>全市二百餘家小同行銀樓業於上月二十九日復業後，裘天寳等十七家大同行，亦巳於昨日全體復業。收進價格照中央銀行規定爲每兩四十八萬元，以後親中央銀行收價增减。兌出價格每兩五十七萬元，內四萬八千元爲合法利潤，四萬二千元爲損耗利息捐稅。普通金工資每錢二千至三千元，舊金飾掉換新金飾，須貼損耗三萬元。昨爲開業第一日，營業清淡，異於邊去。且兌出較收進數倍，故無法雜持長久。聞該業將向政府請求配金，以維持其營業云。</p>
<h3>證券號私設對講電話　四局會同拆除</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：市警察局，社會局，財政局，公用局等，於昨日上午十時起，迄下午四時止，會同證交人員，分赴若干設券字號，拆除私設之對購電話，開被拆除之字號，達十餘家之多。一說市財政爲，將再協助經財兩部駐證交監理員，查閱各字號帳册云。</p>

<h3>收解現鈔　商定簡化辦法</h3>
<p>昨日本市銀錢業兩公會在香港路五十九號舉行聯席會議，討論簡化現鈔收解辦法。蓋以各行莊交換差額之收解，向由中央銀行集中辦理，現鈔收解爲數甚鉅，往往延至深夜方能　事，尤以鉅額現鈔往來搬運，風險甚大，宜當時不及點數，事後發生短缺糾紛亦多，各行莊倍感痛苦。爰經商請中央銀行，凡各行莊應解現鈔得預先交存銀錢業準備會保管，由準備會發給保管證，是項保管證同業間互相收受，且得憑證解交中央銀行，以期穩妥而免送現之煩。中央銀行為顧全各行莊困難起見，己允予接受，同時各行莊如遇應收中央銀行現鈔，亦擬由中央銀行出立寄庫單，交付行莊，以期互得業務上之便利，昨經議決保管規則，並會呈財政部核准備案，以昭鄭重。</p>
<h3>棉布客銷不衰　喊價步步上升</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市况，天津帮對元嗶磯續有採辦外，又有迪化方面去化，客帮收吸頗多，喊價乃步步上升。四君子金印嗶嘰由十六萬元做高至最後爲十六萬五千元，自坯細布初開市尚平定，迨至收盤時，聞紗價仍揚，本街梁廠及店舖門市添補，人心轉堅，各檔細布喊價較之上日一致上揚，自一千元至五六千元不一。十二磅龍頭細布爲十五萬七千五百元，藍鷄爲十五萬元，五福爲十五萬三千元，紡建公司昨照例供售布疋，白坯布五福掛牌十四萬八千五百元，業中人對該公司申購單，加價收買頗多，至其他漂布粗布元色布等價亦依然挺俏。惟藍布及士林布本街門銷不動，市仍疲憊無神。</p>

<h3>素車白馬滿都門　公葬戴雨農將軍</h3>
<p>— 三月廿六日南京快訊　本報特約記者丁匡華</p>
<p>戴笠，戴雨農，中國人沒有一個不知道他的英名的。一寗靜，忍耐，偉大，堅强，是他成功的主要因素。二十年來，不計功名，不計利害，　着「當仁不讓，見義勇爲」的精神，致力革命，獻身國家，來造就他的赫赫事業，他確是個中國的傳奇人物。</p>
<p>「戴將軍的地下工作，强化了抗職陣容；戴將軍的中美合作，縮短了世界戰局。」這是美國朋友追贈戴故將軍的幾句話，同時也是鐵的事實。</p>
<p>誌公殿上忠魂長存</p>
<p>從去年六月十四日那一天，戴故局長的忠魂就寄託在誌公殿裏，他不寂寞。香燭常明，經常有侍靈人員侍奉，安息十個月了。今（廿六）天是他移靈公葬的大典，素車白馬，填塞內外，人山人海，盛况空前，生疏了一年多的長官，同僚，部屬，戚友，今天相見，將軍笑了！將軍濃眉疾目，一派英雄氣槪，令人望而起敬。靈堂佈置簡單，香火繚繞，白調花球國着的戴故局長遺像，置於靈堂的中央，上懸蔣主席哀晚「碧血千秋」續額，殿門兩邊爲胡宗南將軍所輓一聯：「祖悵舞鷄嗚，浩浩黃流，更誰奮擊渡江楫，春風吹野草，滔滬天下，只君足懼亂臣心，」稍進有治長處朱兼處長紹良將軍輓聯：「渡海助斬長鯨，慷慨復仇，九垚幸方價此志，銜風兇占退鶴，從容殉職，千秋贏得表忠碑。」十二時以後，中樞首長及首都各界均紛紛前往弔奠，梁寒操，桂永淸，朱家驊，陳果夫，陳布雷，朱世明，楊虎，杜月笙…等，均臨堂哀奠。天空愁雲慘淡，靈前燭光搖曳，戴公子莊宜含淚答證，靈堂頓呈一片慘痛景象。</p>
<p>異國兄弟靈前痛哭</p>
<p>梅樂斯少將與數雨農將軍同是主持中美合作的首腦人物。自三十一年起，他便與戴將軍計劃如何打去敵冦，如何策應盟軍登陸。五年來同起同落，秘密進人敵後，化裝挺身沿海，指揮　擊作戰，前織訓練學生，曾親歷過若干危險，某决巡視東南，僅一分之差，幾爲敵機射中，因此，他倆不僅是工作上的好友，而且是患難中的異國兄弟。分析敵情，心心相印，喝起酒來，豪飲乾杯。感情是十二萬分融洽的。由美合作，成績斐然，當然是他倆私交　原的收穫。不幸截將軍以身殉國了，梅氏回憶重慶鐘家山往來，竞至痛哭流涕，不可抑止。他這次特地由美國趕來弔奠的。今天他穿着灰黑滲淡的西裝，下車後聞到哀樂，已是鬱結心酸了走上石階，步入靈前，不禁淚如雨下，貯立弔祭，備極袞傷，隨即入內繞棺詣視，　蹙中與戴公子莊宜頻頻握手。戴公子因人興感，放聲大哭。梅氏亦淚如聯珠。其他陪祭人員，亦紛紛流淚，情狀之慘，非可言宣。少將步入休息室後，熱淚歷十餘分鐘不止。我們記者羣詢以中美合作往事，他已悲哀得難以發言，僅稱：「戴將軍是我的中國弟兄，「誠懇」兩字，足可傳頌。我感情實在太衝動，不能再說下去，原諒我！」當翻譯官尚未譯完時，他又滿腔熱淚，汪汪如雨下了。</p>
<p>主席親臨主持葬禮</p>
<p>午後一時，吳鐵老，張岳軍連袂步入了祭堂，兩氏與戴故將軍同是抗戰進程中參贊中樞，商討軍國大計的契友。今天一瞻戴氏遺容，不禁感傷萬分！當兩氏步入休息室時，忽然立正的號角從遠地送來，這時負責警衛的人員賽惕了一陣，知道元首親臨誌公殿來了。在軍樂哀聲中，蔣主席於一時十五分蒞臨了　，黨國元老于院長右任，邵秘　長力子夫婦，亦於此時趕到，併與吳鐵老。張羣。鄭介民列爲陪祭。主席默然俯首，面帶戚容，曾以手套措淚。獻香，獻花，獻讀祭文，語語是淚，句句傷心！當讀至「校崩棟折，黨國之憂，肱股頓失，轉弼無由，周年不見，淚曷能收？遙　大機，我心悠悠！」時，英不流涕。一時鴉雀無聲，山川失色。</p>
<p>將軍長眠千古遺恨</p>
<p>二時正，開始移靈公葬。一時爆竹聲驚動山岳，移靈隊儀仗在密林中緩緩行進。前鋒爲音樂隊，次爲執紼來賓，再次爲覆以黨旗之靈柩。戴氏僚屬左右前後護靈，孝子孝孫殿後。二十分鐘到達墓地，立前正視，即見數氏墓碑。「戴雨農將軍之墓。中華民國三十六年三月廿六日立」。係吳稚老親筆所書，使人望而起敬。墓地坐東朝西，背依紫金山，距國民革命軍陣亡將士墓約有里許，相映爭輝。墓塋係用三合士敏士砌成，長一丈，闊五尺，深五尺，底國旗一面，以示公葬之意。靈柩係由戴氏高級僚屬及學生親爲移入穴內。二時二十五分，正式安葬。梅少將憑弔良久。又於此時流下許多英雄淚來！　正當舉行辭靈禮時，陳部長立夫，潘議長公展，方主委治等，亦於此時趕到，參加典禮。是時，萬　無聲。永遠地痛悼着中國人的不幸和全世界的不幸！</p>
<p>從數字看將軍功勛</p>
<p>戴乎故局長負責軍事情報行勸工作達二十年，對中華民國貢獻太偉大了，我們且從統計數字看他的功勛吧！抗戰八年中，他主持軍事委員會調查統計局，對數破壞二千一百零七次，突擊五百八十五次，制裁敵爲首要五百一十五次，敵爲人員死亡者一萬七千八百七十三人，負傷者四千九百一十六人，俘獲者五百六十六人，毀敵軍機車四百九十二輛，車廂一千六百二十七節，汽車四百七十七輛，汽油二萬零三百二十箱，電機一千七百九十七部，電織二千六百七十五公尺，機器十五部，船艦四百四十二艘，砲台及碉堡五十一座，步馬機槍共二千一三百一十八挺校，砲三十三門，各種彈藥四萬八千二百零九箱，飛機七十一架，兵營一千五百七十八間，軍糧八萬一千四百六十二祖，電綫桿一千三百一十六根，軍服軍毯共五千五百五十一件，毒瓦斯原料五千零五十一箱，橋樑二百五十座，路軌一千六百五十八公尺，鐵絲一萬九千九百二十四丈，煤油五百四十七箱，綢布五萬六千四百十五疋，棉花七千六百七十包，並鹵獲戰利品甚多。</p>
<p>單以中美合作而言，三年來亦擊斃敵寇二六七九九人，傷一一六四二人，俘處五〇八人，破壞橋樑一八二座，舢板一五八只，汽船三五只，飛機一架，車頭車廂四二五節，庫房二七一個，鐵路三〇三段，機動機械車二六九輛，營救聯合國飛行員十三〇名，這些功績，都是戴將軍和他的部屬數十萬人奮鬥犧牲的代價，其聲名自將永垂不朽。</p>
<p>墓地歸來訪梅樂斯</p>
<p>從墓地歸來，覺得沒有得到梅樂斯對戴將軍的蓋棺論定，是一憾事，於是再驅車前往梅氏寓所叩詢。這時，梅少將鎮靜了。記者首詢對載將軍印象怎樣？梅氏欣然以手示告：「戴將軍好，戴將軍好！」接着滔滔不絕對記者說着：「一我對載將軍第一個印象，是他果毅有爲。我初到重慶，與戴將軍見面時，正值中國戰局最危急的時候。我問他沿海佈置有沒有辦法？他回答我說：「有辦法。我絕對負責。兩個月後，你看我的寫實表現！那時，我正忙於遺調人員，沒有機會找他。有一天，他忽然來找我。我很高興地說：「梅先生，你看這一疊電報，這是福州來的。這是溫州來的。這是汕頭來的，這是廣州來的。敵人怎樣蠶動，敵軍所採用的職路，以及敵爲內部的組織，金融的情狀，都一一向我指出。我很驚奇，我緊緊的追問他。這是怎麽回事。他說一星期前，我親自向那些地方去佈置去了。我限他們立即表現成績，我一個牛月前曾向你表示有辦法，我絕對負責，就是這個道理。從這裏開始，我就深深的認識數將軍了，因此我就立刻打電報到華盛頓去，不到半個月，華盛頓就批准我與戴將軍合作的計劃，而產生了後來中美合作所的工作，我對戴將軍第二個印象，是他的任事有責任心。戴將軍每對我說：我的法實，祇有八個字，就是「苦幹，苦守，任勢，任怨」。戴氏一生的成就，就在這個地方，他的部下樂於織命，也做到了「寗靜，忍耐，偉大，堅張」的忠於國家，忠領袖。戴將軍做事有責任心，我拿一個事實來說明：菲律賓克復後，美軍準備從中國登陸，當局曾有情報給我，要我與中國方面策應登陸。一切佈置好了，蔣委員畏深以數人退却以後，游匪乘機擾亂爲憂。戴將軍這時常常飛行東南綫上，進行佈置。有一天，他對蔣委員長說：領袖儘管放心，只要是日軍撤退，在京滬首揭旗幟響應國軍的，一定是我們忠義救國軍。不但游匪開不進來，就是盟軍我們也必須搶在他們的前頭光復京滬，到後來一一實現，這是部下對長官多慶負責任的話。我對戴將軍第三個印象，是他愛護士兵和愛護他的同志一據。他當常脅部屬說：調查統計局的兵和官，一律都是同志，也祇是職務上的分別，我常與戴將軍一道上山下山。戴將軍沿途上隨時動問士兵的生活情形，一有弊病，爲上回去處罰‘因此一般士兵都奉戴將軍如父母，能得安然爲用，這理證明了戴將軍慈祥和一視同仁的美德。……梅少將忙於接聽電鈴已響的電話！記者得着這珍貴的消息，於是便告辭而退。梅少將很客氣的報以「暫別」兩字</p>
<p>戴將軍，生而爲英，死而爲靈，再賦歸來吧！中華民則需要你！</p>
<h3>越南僑商紛紛遷入香港</h3>
<p>— 海防十五日航訊　朱今</p>
<p>越南門戶海防一瞥</p>
<p>越南華僑，目前統計約四十萬人，以性別計：男性佔百分之八十，女性佔百分之二十，以職業計：工界佔多，商界次之，自由職業者又次之。僑居地：以南圻的西堤爲最多，北圻的海防，河內，南定等處次之，中折的順化，歸順等處更决之。以籍貫計：廣東最多，福建次之，其他各省者很少。</p>
<p>海防是越南的門戶之一，學術團體有「東安」，「僑英」，「時習」，「中華」等同學會的成立。最近成立的還有僑中校友會，中華國　聯誼會等，中華會館理事長羅偉基，中華商會會會長　純禮都是本市老僑領。</p>
<p>前駐海防領事朱垣章，已奉調返京，代理期間由河內總領事館謝戊申負責。刻新任駐海防領事蕭金芳氏已來防，不日當正式視事。蕭氏對法最近擬恢復從前之邦長制度加以反對，他認爲此種制度之設立，顯有分散華儒力量之企圖；如法方必欲恢復此項邦制，則決定採取有效對策。渠對本市（海防）僑敎非常重視。日來簫氏赴各地視察頗忙。</p>
<p>河內市區秩序恢復</p>
<p>河內是北圻的政治經濟文化交通上的中心，中美國總領事館設於斯，現在法軍（指越北）最高指揮地巴上校在道裏指揮法軍同越盟軍作戰。</p>
<p>河內市區秩序恢復，但商業已陷於停頓狀態。這裏沒有大規模的出版事業，精神糧食祗得靠香港，西貢，昆明各地的供給。華僑文化水準較低，對祖國影片無多大興趣。</p>
<p>三不管區刧案迭起</p>
<p>茫街位於中越邊界，地區很小，居民大多華人，與廣東省防誠縣的東興鎮隔河相對。以地理上觀之，邊陲之地，本無多大價值，但由於過去抗職軍興，這塊邊區小地，居然成爲廣東南路向越南移動的唯一路綫，一切都繁榮了起來。　街人口不過萬人，市容頗整潔。惟近來該處治安欠佳。夜來刧案迭起，使市民受驚不小。法方勢力還沒有到達，越南人力量不够，中國政府不管，因此成了三不管。盜匪出沒無常。</p>
<p>華僑商務分區考察</p>
<p>（一）北圻方面：海防，河內興港，澳門，北海，湛市（廣州灣）水運便利，此間僑胞大多營出口生意，以米，煤，鐵，及各種士產爲大宗。</p>
<p>（二）中圻方面：順化，娛港，會安，淸化，宜安，廣治，廣義等處，以經營藥材者較多，洋雜貨土產决之，食用品又决之。</p>
<p>（三）南圻方面：西貢堤岸簡稱「西堤」，商埠較大，人數較多，生意部門繁雜，以船隻，米，糖，生慕，木材，柴炭爲主要業務，洋雜貨銷路較廣，各種副業亦頗繁榮。</p>
<p>（四）高棉寮國方面：以墾植糊椒，木棉，玉蜀黍爲多，商塲以藥材洋貨爲普遍。</p>
<p>北圻方面，自去年法方公佈統制進出口貿易及出入口結匯辦法後，進出口貿易幾陷於停頓狀熊，華僑經濟已受到嚴重打擊。自法越戰事發生後，情形更慘，大部份商家已向香港遷移。</p>

<h3>新教育·新青年·新中國</h3>
<p>— 周緝熙</p>
<p>靑年是國家的新無胞，是民族的新血輪。所以一個新國家的建設，一國新民族的成長，或者一個古老國家的議新，一個衰老民族的復興，端賴有健康，賢良，智力高，能力强以及有志有為有守的優秀青年；但要有這樣的新青年，須有盡賽盡美的新敎育。我們要建設富强康樂的新中國，必須敎育健賢智能的新靑年，並發展盡善盡美的新敎育。</p>
<p>新敎育我們已辦了幾十年，但都是東抄西製，人云亦云，沒有取長捨短，翻陳出新，在中國敎育文化的領域裏，茁長起新教育的良芽，結下來新教育的碩果。相反的，培養出無數的漢奸，國賊，貪官司，汚吏，奸商，土豪，劣紳……以致新教育愈辦，國家社會愈亂愈貧！所以我們要育才建國，救國救民，必須來一個新的建國敎育運動，來辦我們敎育新靑年，建設新中國的改途易轍的新生敎育。</p>
<p>敎育新靑年，建設新中國的新敎育，最重要的，要培養靑年高尚的人格，去年七月十一日，作者由渝飛京，勝利還都，因痛感一般人民人格，體格資格水準之低下，以及學風，政風·家風，社風與國風之江河日下，實爲建國前途之一大陣礙，曾在「大公報」發表「祟三格·整五風」一文，而圖正人心，移風俗。時隔八月，三格五風更壞，以致國家社會更亂更究，一般無知民衆更不堪命。長此以往，國家民族的前途，眞不堪設想！我們要救國救民，建設新中國，必須尊崇人格，整飭頽風；欲整飭頹風，尊祟人格，必先整飭學風，培養靑年高尚的人格；要整飭學風，培養靑年高尚的人格，又必先由敎育常局禮聘德高望重有偉大崇高之人格的名流學者，爲大學中學校長及主持訓導人員（大學之訓導長，中學之訓育主任），使他們能以身作則，爲靑年師表，實施人格感化喲人格敎育。如無高尚的人格，德望朱孚者，則雖才高八斗，學富五車，亦不配做大學由學校長及訓導人員。至於優良學風的培養，靑年人格的陶冶，據作者管見所及，似應以忠·信·勤·儉四字爲目標。「忠」字的意義，我以爲就是「負責」。當此建國大時代的中國新靑年，最重要的，要忠於國家，忠於人民，也就是對國家對人民負責，大家要立定建國救民的大志，負起建國救民的大責；以救人民於水深火熟之中，致國家於富强康樂之城爲已任。其次，要忠於職務，靑年學生，雖尚未爲社會國家服務，但其在校求學，原為學以致用，爲國家社會服務。所以對於將來擬任的職務，須有充分的準備，深刻的研究，等到學成就業之時，便能展其所長，站在自己的崗位上，爲國家社會的某一部門建設事菜，作最善的努力和最大的貢獻。他如服務道德的訓練，刻耐勞精神的培養，都是訓練靑年勇於負責，忠於職務的人格敎育。第二，「信」字的意義，就「字形」上看，就是「人言爲信」。所以受新敎育的新靑年們，一定要心裏怎樣想就怎樣說，口裏怎樣說就怎樣做；想·說·做或心·言·行三者，要如幾何學上所說的三點，把三者聯結起來，成爲一條直綫，這就是心直口直，言行一致，也就是信。反之，如果聯結道三點，成爲一個角形，那就是曲而不直，行不　言，言不由衷，而不信了。所以受新敎育的新靑年，無論爲學·做人·作事·接物·處世…都要聲心相應，言行一致，也就是心。言。行合一，以義成信義卓著的人格。第三，「勤」字的意義，就是盡心力去做而不怠緩厭倦，靑年學生，如能勤學，而持之以恒，則必因其性之所近，才之所長，心之所好，力之所至，繼續不斷的自强不息的功夫之所到，而日積月累，年復一年，逐漸獲得相當的進步與成功，乃至成爲大科學家，大發明家，大學問家，都在於「動」之一字。我們爲建設新中國而受新敎育的新靑年，其可不「勸」求學問，養成勸勞的德性以謀建立功業嗎？第四，「儉」的意義，就是儉約一而不妄費。今日在中學大學受敎育之靑年，有錢的往往揮霍無度，侈靡感風，浪費國家社會的資財，虛擲寳貴的靑春光陰。這是何等的可惜！而且他們往往穿的是洋服，吃的是西菜，用的是外貨，無不利源外溢，尤爲痛心！我們要提倡國貨，提倡節的建國，必須由靑年學生做起，靑年學生，不但要節的金錢物資，並且節的時問，因爲他們尚在求學的消費時代，消費者要浪費，求學的去遊玩，實在是國家社會的蠹蟲，其前途將不堪設想！所以全國靑年學生，必須養成儉約的美德。新敎育能以上述四者陶冶新靑年的忠以愛國，信以做人，勤以求學，儉以養廠的高尚人格與德性，才能造就建設新中國的新人才。深望全國辦理新敎育訓練新靑年的同志們，注意及之。</p>
<p>其次，敎育新靑年，建設新中國的新敎育，必須訓練靑年科學的知能，建設的技術。我國過去的學校科學敎育，可以說是與國家建設民生活要相脫節，於是一方面是國家社會各部門建設事業需要人才而求之不得，一方面是無數的靑年需要工作而求之不得。這種矛盾現象的造成，原因固然很多，但其主要原因則在過去敎育上訓練的不够，以致靑年一出校門，知能上不免發生間題，而呈現於我們面前的，便是各種建設事業都需要人才，而無數靑年則不能就業。我們懲前瑟後，今後訓練新靑年的新敎育，必須積極的訓練他們科學的知能，建設的技術</p>
<p>中等學校的科學教育，必須注重實騐，及編訂「中國本位」的敎科書，使科學說中國話，並研究中國的科聲問題。但實騐除爲閘明基木的科學原理而外，須注重民生日用所需的料學知能，與各種建設事業所需的科學技術。科學實騐與研究所需要的圖書儀器及其一切設備，必須力求充實。至於編訂中國本位的良好敎科書，則應注意下下列三點：（一）認識我國歷史上對於科學的發明事實及共貢獻，以堅定青年對於發展科學的民族自信力；（二）討論新中國建設所需要的工，農，礦業與科學原理，及建設新中國所缺乏的幾種人才與材料，以引起靑年將來選習專科的興趣；（三）盡量採入並研討木國產品的性質，用途，數量及製造方法，與如何改進，可以改良品質，增加產量。</p>
<p>在高等敎育方面，則應使靑年的科學研習瑟國家建設民生需要相配合；即凡專科以上學校的科學敎育，須以訓練國家建設的幹部人才爲目標。專科以上學校的靑年學生，須多予以實習與實騐的時間和機會。如能利用寒暑假期，派往工廠，農塲，礦塲，醫院等等處實習，使其畢業後，各有一種專門的科學技術，即能致力於建設工作則更佳！作者年前在重慶時，曾聞國立邊疆學校，利用寒暑假期，選派學生分赴各工廠學習一種專門技術，如製皮製革之類，聞結果甚爲良好。這種辦法，實在是訓練靑午學習科學技術的好方法，各校均可倣行。至於規模較大的大學，而有理，工，農，醫等學院者，則應設立與建設事業有關的研究院或研究所，並延攬人才，充實設備，招收研究生，致力科學的研究。軍家學者們，如要研究一個科學問題，更應隨時供給其資料，而期其有所發明或創造？研究科學成績特優之青年學生，應該予以重賞，以資鼓勵。</p>
<p>現在的世界，是科學的世界，我們要建設現代化的新中國，必須積極發展科學教育，訓練靑年科學的知能與技術。</p>
<p>復次，新敎靑必須訓練强健勇武，具有奮鬥進取的精神的新靑年，奔向建設新中國的前途而邁步前進。</p>
<p>我們中國，向有「東亞病夫」之議。一般靑年學生，亦往往體弱多病。據各校健康檢查的結果，百分之八十以上，身體上都有缺點。這是建國前途的一大障碍，我們要建設富强康樂的新中國，必須訓練强健勇武的新靑年，使未老先衰的，體弱多病的靑年學生，轉化爲强壯健康，「孔武有力」，「有勇知方」的「料糾武夫」。要想達到此目的，各級學校，必須特別注意靑年的健康，舉凡增進健康的醫藥，衛生，體育等設備，必須力求充實。對於厠所，敎室，膳堂，宿舍和學校一切塲地的淸潔以及環境衛生，尤當特別注意，體育一課，尤須普遍推行健身運動，每天務必舉行早操或課間操，並規定課外運動時間，強迫青年學生人人參加，無故不能缺席。春天來臨，應為靑年學生種症，以防天花。夏令一到，應爲他們注射霍亂，傷寒，銅疾等病的疫苗，以防疫癘，而保安全。此外，如指學靑年學生作有定時，飲食付定量，生活有規律，以及訓練他們衛生的習慣，戒除他們吸烟飲酒等類的一切不良嗜好，並積極推行健康敎育，都是使靑年學生，强身去病，增進健康的新敎育股施與活動。</p>
<p>新教育於訓練靑年强健的身體以外，還要訓練他們勇敢尚武的精神，使他們們具有敢作敢爲的胆量，見義勇爲的勇氣，以及奮鬥犧牲，力謀進取的精神，百折不回，建功立業的毅力。</p>
<p>新敎育是訓練新靑年的大事業，新靑年是建設新中國的生力軍。我可敬可佩可愛的辦理新教育的同志們！我們都是訓練建設新中國的生力軍的敎練官，這成千成萬的生力軍，全靠我們有高尚的人格，感化他們；有超人的智慧，敎導他們；有壯健雄偉的精力，訓練他們，使他們成爲人格高尚，智慧超羣，强壯勇武的健賢智能的，有志有爲有守的新靑年，建設起富强康樂的現代新中國。</p>
<p>本月十日，作考在「大公報」發表「建國敎育之路」一文後，或承屈罵晤談，或蒙賜書商討，於感奮之餘，草成此文，尚乞敎育同志，靑年朋友，有以敎之。（三六，三，二六寫於上海，南通學院。</p>

<h3>蠶校畢業女生呼籲</h3>
<p>我們是從一個女子菰校畢業出來不幸的一羣，畢業後即遭到失業的痛苦，從前在校時的美麗理想，都成了泡影，我們不敢有其他的奢望，祗希望社會給我們一個機會，能够學有所用，於是我們等着機會的到來，今年終於機會來了，江蘇省蠶榮管理改進委員會刋着徵求指導員五百名之消息，我們連忙趕去登記，可是一月後所得的回音是因無經歷而不能錄用，這對我們猶如是一個晴天霹靂，我們感到如何地失望與痛心！</p>
<p>請問：那些有經歷的人難這剛出學校就有經歷？不是從沒有經歷而來的嗎？如果必須有經歷才能錄用，那來國家設立蠶校，所爲何來？我們這羣無經歷的難道就永建做社會的寄生蟲！一輩子完了嗎？我們要質問蠶委會爲什麽要遺棄我們，我們要呼籲，要求社會的人士們！伸出援助同情之手救敎我們（蘇州一羣蠶校畢業女生）</p>

<h3>談國父斥陳和事</h3>
<p>— 梁烈亞</p>
<p>日前讀本報「紀念國父二十二週年專刋」，內載國父之故事一則云：「國父性慈和，極少燥怒，居上海時，其僕曰陳和，頗愚蠶，遇不當意時，國父或斥之曰：「大泡和」，但亦極少開。大砲和者，粵語謂：愚蠢也。」等語：</p>
<p>可是我所知道者；陳和亦係同志，並非國父之僕役，其爲國父之廚司，亦係一半受聘一半効勞的性質，其人亦非愚蠶之流，祇有好賭而已。所以，馮自由先生在其所著。「革命逸史」內說。「一日章太炎，田桐，胡漢民等在總理寓所（日本東京，時一九〇六年丙午）高談革命，鄧慕韓在座無從置喙（鄧綽號師爺）乃入廚下，同廚子陳和及日本下女大講時政，興高采烈，聲震戶外。陳和亦屬同志，性好賭，常以買菜錢供一擲。有一决因賭輸金盡，乃揚言在冷巷失其鞋，欲總理給資再購。（冷巷爲粵中土語，即俗稱走廊，日本建築，走廊設於室內，日俗席地而坐，鞋履均置於室外）走廊決無失鞋之理，廚房演說及冷巷失鞋二事皆屬奇聞罕見，總理嘗傚章回小說之章目，戲作一聯以贈鄧慕韓，陳和二人云：「鄧師爺計房演說；陳和叔冷巷失鞋」以嘲之」。黨人在柬京者，亦以此爲趣事妙文，文雅幽默，傳誦一時。至於總理不用「陳　子」對「鄧師爺」者，乃認陳和爲革命同志，不以廚子目之也。再轡中土語，亦以處言無實在爲「大泡」，更以虛言誇大驚人爲「大砲」，是「大泡」不盡用以形容愚蠢之人，然陳和誠可稱「大泡和」者矣！</p>
<p>又余在隨從總理時間內，朱嘗見總理對於私人所任用之職工，有不當意之時，漫加申斥者，縱遇有錯誤，亦不過以言語解釋詳爲指示而己。然亦有見同志中因誤軍事及違背黨之主張而遭申斥者計共有三人。一，當世界第一次大戰時，總理正欲乘此機會，一面推倒叛國之袁氏政府，同時又向英法各國提出取消對我國之不平條約，然後作有利益之參戰。汪逆兆銘素好自作主張。不能深體總理之大計，竟擅自著一本「參戰問題」的册子，意在催促我國速行參入戰團，極爲總理所不滿。一日汪謁見總理，被總理阻却，並用申斥之口氣囑黃惠龍先生告汪曰：「呌他（指汪）不要來見我，快點走開！」後汪乃將其書册盡數燬減。二，是劉玉山先生所部不能堅守博羅，反自石龍退至石灘，時適遇總理督戰座車趕至，劉之參謀長葉夏聲先生晋謁總理於車內，總理以該軍作戰不力，大爲申斥！蔣總裁時任總參謀長，隨從在側亦極爲震怒，乃限令該軍於二小時內克復失地，否則以軍令論罪。葉乃奮勇興起率同團長覃壽喬反身衝戰，始將石能克復，廣州乃得安定。三，十三年滇軍駐粵，每每據地收稅，遠抗政令，時人以驕兵悍將稱之。一日　軍師長趙成樑入帥府晋謁總理，對總理稱日「先生」，總理不悅並申斥之曰：「你不配稱我「先生」！（凡我黨人多稱總理曰「先生」，而不加姓氏，如孔門弟子稱夫子然），你是軍人穿軍服，應尊本大元帥爲「大元帥」。等語：茲特一併誌及，以實史乘。</p>
<h3>最初的來信</h3>
<p>— 藍蕙</p>
<p>信，是一稱溫暖，而我，曾得到過許多友誼的溫暖的來信；我覺得自已是幸福的。</p>
<p>我曾想給一個我所懷念的人一封信，但不幸我是胆怯的，沒有勇氣，那封信終於沒有寫；我只是在安靜的長夜裏，悄悄地寄給他一份冥想和祝福，或者偶而有時在夢裏看見他的影子，那從前留在我記憶裏的，不變的影子；想起那熟悉的影子來，我就全身充滿了活力，我偷偷地敬愛着他，不讓另一個人知道。</p>
<p>然而，有一天，我却意外地（也是很久地暗暗幻想着的），又驚又喜地得到了他第一封來信。</p>
<p>那是一個陰沉的下午，霏霏地飛了一天雨絲，泥土潤濕着，發散出一種淸新的氣味。我手指顫慄地拿住那封信，按捺下激動的心情，强迫自己去猜想那信封上秀麗的筆跡，是屬於一隻什麽一樣的手所寫的；記憶淸斷地告訴我那是他的字跡，但過份因喜悅面跳動的心，却以希望是眞的而不敢相信的複雜矛盾的心情，說那不是他的字跡……</p>
<p>——如果不是他的字跡，又是誰的字跡呢？……奇怪、那多像他的跡呵！……我茫然，站住不動，猶疑着。</p>
<p>終於，像卜決自己的命運一樣，驚慌的手指迅速地撕開了信封的口，急迫而留心地扯出了信箋，恐怕投傷了賽貴的信；我心跳着，搶着先着了信末的簽名——是他！是他底名字呵！……我即即把信揣進口袋裏，彷彿怕它頃刻之問會「變」了一樣；然後，像偷了什麼事四怕人發覺似的，我匆匆地走向遠處的用隴。只有一個念頭：讓我獨自一個人來咀嚼那信中的字句。</p>
<p>我沒入綠色的包谷土中了。包谷的林子給我園成了一小方綠色的世界，雨絲拂着我底臉頰，有一種凉爽的感覺。我底心不停地思想着，繁忙而雜亂，達自己也不淸楚究竟在想些什麽；只覺得臉上無緣無故地在發燒……</p>
<p>沒有一點遺　地，我底眼光搜讀着信紙上每一個使我記憶回復的字，和每一句親切的話語；我不僅能了解那上面所有的意思，甚至能默記上面每一個字的形象……</p>
<p>我頭上仍是那塊陰沉的天，然而我却開始有着一個較睛天更爲開朗的心情：我覺得自己的心輕輕地飄升起來！像一雙又經又巧的小舟，浮泊在溫暖的愛之海；又像一隻矯健不倦的鷹，盤旋在充滿光農熱的高闊的碧空。</p>
<p>漸漸地我沉入幻想裏：我彷彿覺得身上忽然有股力量衝動着，想大聲地唱歌，或者放開脚步飛奔……</p>
<p>之後，我真想跪下來，親吻這發着香味的土地，並几感謝天——這世界多麽可愛！</p>
<p>我喃喃地，自個兒微笑着，想起了很多很多的事情。（一九四七，三月抄）</p>
<h3>記恭綽館</h3>
<p>— 呂白華</p>
<p>讀「交通救國論」者，莫不知大隱於市之葉恭綽先生，爲廊廟先進，佐總理治財，建辦鐵路，厥功允偉。而不知其經濟文章，實倡與新學之第一人也。先生早歲游庠，出長沙張文達公門，文達公當革命思想，薪火之傳，固有自來。自與總理相往還，力主興交通必先敎育，設鐵路同人學校凡七十五所，上海之交通大學，遂於是成立，先生任校長。顧名思義，即知中國交通人才之　　，先生樹其風焉！日寇猾夏，先生閉門讀易，臺明夷「內難而能正其志」，寗比於箕子。今交通　友，迫懷仰止，欲有　　去　，乃於先生昔年校內樹立之工　館，改義日「　綽館」。將　先生杖贊其中，邊鋒未已，木　可閱，亦足以起衰也已！是為記。</p>
<h3>春之頌</h3>
<p>— 林咏泉</p>
<p>昨夜——</p>
<p>近黃昏時、天空舖起一張更濃的黑幔，一陣風也颳着與平時相反的方向。大地被遮暗了，窗子被封閉了。</p>
<p>又值停電，室內也是漆黑的，在醒與睡的糢糊中聽到外面有着許多聲響，最初是　　嗦嗦，漸爲嘁嘁喳喳，是後則演成呼呼嘯嘯，我知道是落雨了。「小樓昨夜聽春雨，深巷明朝賣杏花」明晨的風光要不同了。</p>
<p>淸晨，太陽以其年輕的濃艷的紅頰從東方的小山頂上鑽出來，而我便醒了。我是被那强烈的紅光所照醒，被那不可抗拒地靑春的活力推動得醒了。</p>
<p>我幾乎每天都是非常安靜地默默地爬起來，做着每天旱晨應做的事，現在還要多一層生活手續的，是昨天早晨買了幾東隨季節而來的花校，需要換水以及花葉枝條約整理！與一個女孩兒家的梳妝無異，這樣差不多要佔去半小時的時間。一朝陽漸離開了山頂。</p>
<p>當我從床沿站起，推開那關閉了一夜的窗子時；便清晰地感到一羣淸新的晨風，蹦蹦跳跳地撲進來，緊接着那園中的菜花香，林樹的新蓓香，草地的新草香……都不約而同地相率而來。而瓶中的桃花，梨花，野枝子花：播散在一夜屋中的香氣與這些從窗外所竄進來的便混成一起，組成羣香之陣，羣香的隊伍。</p>
<p>它們是太活潑了，更和悅而多情。它們是隨處散步着，到處旅行着……</p>
<p>這是最宜於讀書了，於是我便携着我最濃的喜悅與我最喜愛的詩句走出院中，而它們仍是圍繞在我喲周圍，它們在扶肩竊笑嗎？在披散着輕烟似的纖髮跳着運環舞唱着低音之歌嗎？</p>
<p>這眞是幸福啊，眞是最珍員的人間一刻啊！</p>
<p>在公路上，我向那坦平地閃着白色的陽光的大路張着臂，那是多麼舒暢的呼吸啊！我更用最闊長的步度丈量着路，然後挺着胸，延着全部軀體走進菜園裏。</p>
<p>我知道它們依然跟隨着我，一路伴隨着我。而我也看到隨處都有另一些在遊戲，在談天，而那無際的田原上，又有許多在飄飄蕩蕩地從遠處走近來。</p>
<p>又泅入道海裏，這變遷過幾度滄桑之海了。這一片綠，這飲下一夜醉酒的綠原，更加綠了。多少日子被禁鋼在乾土中的根芽開始從酥軟的糕餅中蠕動而張手張脚地向外爬出，葱綠的華葉，以其生命的全力，向上空伸長，向鄰空舖放。</p>
<p>一些穀物—尤其那集攏得無邊的蠶豆，在她那一顆顆橢圓形的小葉上，都浸潤上一些小亮光的水液，牠們還不能凝成珠，因而我們也不願呌牠是露，其由來無非是那些細屑的霧絡的遣留。</p>
<p>但是這陽光下，這過分溫情的眸子顧盼下；所有的穀物與野草，都因牠—遺留下的霧絡，而顯現着生命的活躍，顯現着葱蘢的生機。</p>
<p>太陽漸爬上較高的梯級了。</p>
<p>那一片黃花畦，巳開始在熟鬧着。不知在什麼時候，遠遠近近的蜂蝶，都趕塲似的趕到。而那兒便成天有着陶醉，有着不停歇的歌聲與密語—也許還夾雜着一些華福的爭鬥與吵鬧……這些，我們却無從分辨。</p>
<p>那些軀體茁壯的蠶豆，除了用牠們集合的體魄排成波濤澎湃海似的形態外，還在每一株層層扁葉下，綴着小灰蝶似的灰花。那些花也匯成一大團樸質的，鄉氣的却不是甜密的香氣。所有的蜂蝶也聞香而來。但多以那與花相似彷彿有着同種族的關係的小灰蝶，總是吻附在花底面頰上，久久不去。</p>
<p>還有那些小烏，那些不知名的蛾似的小烏，也在這湛綠地穀物的海上疾飛着，鳴呌着……誰知這又爲什麽呢？或者牠們也戀這海，牠們底伴侶曾迷失於海裏？逃避於海的深處……牠們在尋覓嗎？呼喚嗎？</p>
<p>被冬天的風把所有的葉子撕扯得淨盡的公路邊的高楊，也在牠們那乾枯似的技條上凸出了新苞，如四月問池塘的孑孓，擁擠得不成樣子。</p>
<p>穿着各色樣衣飾的兒童，也隨處都可看到，與她們底母親以及所有雖年長却仍是春情甚濃的親勝們配合起來；正像撒落在地上一些繽紛的小花瓣，和一兩片大花蓓及幾顆大葉子。</p>
<p>少女們總是聯肩携手而過，她們在彼此傳達溫暖嗎？彼此做另一種假設的寄托嗎？</p>
<p>風來了。霧也漸散了。遠遠的山又淸晰地擺出來。請睜開適才那夢境的眼睜向遠方望望吧，遠方也都在忙着春天嗎？（一九四七·春·昆明軍次）</p>
<h3>春柳四首</h3>
<p>— 史良黻</p>
<p>去臘卿雲書刋，籌印新年擴大版，編者蔣孝遊君索詩索畫甚急，倉率問寫寄舊作春柳一律應的，發表後辱承魯莽午昌諸先生　獎，獲得不少安慰，今春病後元坐無聊，敝續四首。推敲之餘，錄請進珊先生郢政。</p>
<p>一橫烟水鎖池塘，薄薄羅衣淡淡粧。杜宇悲啼連夜雨，春風先到讀書堂。詩情搖曳游絲裏，逸興湍飛官道傍。語汝陌頭靑不得，　中少婦恨非常！</p>
<p>杜鵑聲裏綠如烟，又是江南二月天，漫立門前情脈脈，低窺簾外恨綿綿。風拖碧影侵書幌，花帶淸查落硯田。靖節先生仙去後；淡駐濃抹爲誰妍？</p>
<p>織腰嫋未勝扶，翠黛輕描入畫圖。南國姿容分外麗，小蠻體格木來酥。一彎水繞蒼龍偃，三徑花如白雪鋪。指點武昌舊侯館；不堪往事憶糢糊！</p>
<p>左倚欄杆右傍樓，宜　宜喜正嬌羞。雖然濂海烽烟急；依舊亭臺景色幽。一雨不妨移舊態，雙眉何事鎖深愁？昨脊人約黃昏後，碧玉梢頭月半鈎。</p>
<h3>小藝人</h3>
<p>— 雷諾阿</p>
<p>雷諾訶Auguste　Renoir　1947-1979是一生貧困的畫家，同薛司賴一樣，三天四天沒有麵包吃是很平常的事。但是他並不因而放棄繪事，每日不斷地在努力着，終於發現了印象的原理，成爲印象派的一員大將。所作人物，裸女較多，顏色艷麗，筆調柔美，主體與背景打成一遍，感覺極渾厚。晚年息半身瘋，足不能立，隱居南法康納，終日坐於自動椅上，仍繼續工作，享年七十一歲。（獅）</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸血307</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>同時，他沒有忘記研究這個年輕的下女；她雖說不怎麽美，却不惹厭，很有松島鄉裏那位菊子的形態。行動非常伶俐，似乎是在學校裏受過競技練習的。尤其令人注意的，是她的一雙犀利機警的眼神。這次走進房裏，她一面對答說話，一限早已注意到地板上那張奇怪字條。鶴見的眼中，不能忽略這些細節。</p>
<p>下女聽了鶴見的吩咐，退出不到一分鐘，鶴見的這位部下巳經入室見禮了。</p>
<p>「正岩君…坐下說話罷！」鶴見對待部下，一直是這們隨便的，除非有高級同事在座。</p>
<p>「隊長！」這位部下，很不安的坐下了，「早農迎駕，去遲了十分鐘，趕到道裏來告罪，那位同隊長一齊到滬的小姐，吩咐到十點二十分再來。」說着又站起來，行了一假敬禮，正式請罪。</p>
<p>「收到岳秘書長的消息？」鶴見意思說，正岩得到他來滬的消息。</p>
<p>「消息有好幾起，關於「八」號松字，注明隊長和她一齊的行動。」正岩重新坐下了。</p>
<p>「還有別的重要消息沒有？」</p>
<p>「最大的消息是關於長谷川淸司令的……他部下的艦隊，大約就要出動了。」</p>
<p>「噢！」鶴見有些震動。這長谷司令的艦隊，海軍陸戰隊，還有水上轟炸機隊，和水雷大隊，在各艦隊中，很有好勇狠鬥的聲名。這個動作是大舉登陸的象微，鶴見不能不有些震動。</p>
<p>「還有什麽嗎？」鶴見怔了一怔，沉吟了好一會。「還有松，蘭，梅，各　動隊都發動了，今晨三到四時，就有兩　的隊員，乘機南來，上海停駐了一部分，也有一些上南京去了。」</p>
<p>山本正岩是台灣的混血，生在上海，就地受了小學敎育，在日本念中學，卒業後進通訊技術專校，在東北見習了兩年之後，奉派到上海，一直是在鶴見的部下任職。在鶴見的組織裏，他是「〇一三」號。到上海後，對職務上仍舊是山本，私人方面，却用的林正岩三個字，理由是「辦事便利。」他同鶴見年齡相彷彿，二十六七，腦筋雖不十分靈活，對鶴見却十分忠誠；並能曾往直前。</p>
<p>「蘭組派的什麽人？」鶴見一直是注意土肥原的。</p>
<p>「一共四個人，倒有三個是女性。名單上記者，首腦是「特八號」川島芳子；到眼面前爲止，沒有看見她到部裏來過，也許根本沒有南來。」</p>
<p>「川島芳子！」鶴見把這名字重複了一遍，「那是蘭組以外的什麼特組—蘭組的衛星—那老東西，凖備着大擴充哩…」</p>
<p>一實地報到的，只有一男一女，還有一個呌什麽米子的，也沒看見。」正岩繼續他的報告：「他們的任務，好像十分緊張…」</p>
<h3>從趙襄子豪飲說起</h3>
<p>— 卜束</p>
<p>「東坡志林」中記載了這樣的一個笑話：</p>
<p>「有二措大，相與言志，一云：我平生不足惟飯與睡耳；他日得志，當吃飽了飯便睡，睡了又吃飯。一云：我則異於是，當吃了又吃，何暇復睡耳。」</p>
<p>這兩位措大都不想「載通」，倘能爲文，自然都屬於「言志派」。一個是吃與睡，一個是單純的吃，事情都很好笑，所以只呵當作笑話看。</p>
<p>然而也有不能常作笑話看的笑話。</p>
<p>「趙　子飲酒，五日五夜不廢酒。謂侍者日：我誠邦士也！夫飲潤五日五夜矣，而殊不病。優莫日：君勉之，不及紂二日耳。紂七日七夜，今君五日五夜。襄千權，謂優莫日：然則吾亡乎。優莫曰：不亡。襄子日：不及紂二日耳，不亡何待？優莫曰：桀紂之亡也遇湯武。今天下盡桀也，而君紂也。桀紂並世，焉能相亡？然亦殆矣。」（劉向：新序）</p>
<p>二大所吃虧的是見識不廣，只曉得吃與睡；趙裏子也一樣，飲酒五日五夜而不病，於是便昂然自得了。——他忘了商辛雖能飲七日七夜，結局還是一個亡國之君。</p>
<p>徒憑吃與睡來開拓未來的歷史，是不行的。優莫所謂：「桀紂並世，焉能相亡？」其實也不盡然。有只知飲酒的紂，便也有只知殺人掠地的桀，桀紂也可分大小，分强弱，春秋職國時代的各國兼併，便是桀紂相亡的例子。</p>
<p>曾經讀過一篇愛偷堡的論文，其中有論及二次大職前法國的「史事」處，曰：</p>
<p>「無數具有詩的靈感的人都傾全力於巴黎人的娛樂起初是射學，一些年靑的姑娘睡在吊床上，一些年靑哥兒把子彈向一個靶子射去，於是那吊床落下來了，姑娘們發着尖聲怪氣的呌喊，跌在頗爲悅目的一團裏。由射擊而靶子，這些騷人墨客便轉到游泳上來了。姑娘們在那些受着感動的Gigoer前面沉入水裏，哥兒們一面飲着Cechtuilo一面雖着那些滿身淋演的美人。」</p>
<p>這是四十年代初期法國士紳的娛樂，雖然不是大戰秘辛，但道出了法國職敗的眞正原因了的。哥兒們的行徑，較之趙襄中的飲酒自然要闊氣多了。較之措大們夢想吃與睡，自然更闊氣得多。但也還有愈益闊氣的樂事，那是在游泳和射擊以後的發明。</p>
<p>「巴黎人中靑汽車不中意牧人的牧馬。詩人們得到解決的辦法了，他們把少女的身份降低到和汽軍一樣。一個名叫Tcoxic-Gtgx的跳舞塲在巴黎開幕了，顧客購買票子，票子給他們取得少女的權利，那些少女胸口都有號碼：T.G.標價一法郎半，顧客可以邀那些年靑姑娘跳舞，他可以流涎，吸鼻涕，或使人聞到臭味：這是他的權利。」</p>
<p>游泳，射學，汽車女郎的舞蹈，此類大好韻事，都是一九三三年法國統治者所嘖嘖樂道的。他們皆頭昏腦了好幾年，希特勒則製造槍砲好幾午，一且事發，雍容儒雅的法軍便潰不成軍。巴黎陷後，舉白旗，賦哀詞，完事了。而這，也就是桀紂相亡的另一例。</p>
<p>以桀伐紂，一切都差不多，不過，先前愛好槍砲的桀，其後天下太平，也慢慢的會愛起游泳和射擊來，或甚至會發明了更多的樂事。榮事越多，足見這世界在「相亡」中也還能進步。</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>南昌的老鼠</h3>
<p>— 又今</p>
<p>在中學裏，讀過盲詩人愛羅先珂的童話，他描寫李鴻章時，說李鴻章是吃老鼠的民族。我大爲李鴻章不平，因爲我和李鴻章是同鄉，由於我的不吃老鼠，足以證明李鴻童是決不會吃老鼠的。心想俄國人的造謠，眞是十分可惡！</p>
<p>後來我漸漸知道南方人的確有吃老鼠的，而且這次的南昌鼠疫，就是因爲吃炒老鼠吃出來的。</p>
<p>報載江西省審計處職員黎雪橋（廣東籍）夫婦，一同吃炒老鼠，一同吃死了！據醫生說：「平常吃一頭老鼠，是並沒有多大的關係的。這次黎氏夫婦吃的大概是因爲還沒有炒熟，細菌尚未殺死，一吃下去，組菌侵入淋巴腺，因而致死的。」</p>
<p>鼠疫桿菌被發現了，鼠疫蔓延開來，死的人日見多，於是南昌「談鼠色變」了！</p>
<p>在抗戰期間，鼠疫在福建和浙江的交界處，鬧得很厲害，現在漸漸由南而北了由東而西了，江西從前是不大有過風疫的，如今也蔓延起來，眞是可怕的事！</p>
<p>固然，即使黎氏夫婦不曾吃老鼠，鼠疫要蔓延，也還是遏止不住的，可是黎氏夫婦也許不曾立即同時都死的。古人云：「病從口入，禍從口出。」現在照黎氏夫婦的情形看起來，我們要改一改，說：「禍從口入，病從口出」了。假使不吃炒老鼠，她們倆不會立即惹殺身之禍；豈不是「禍從口入」嗎？至於「病從口出」，那更是顯而易見的，鼠疫病借了黎氏夫婦兩口兒之死而證實了，當然是所謂「病從口出」了。</p>
<p>口腹之慾，其禍之烈，一至於此！這比較「拚死吃河豚，」寗可就死而河豚不可不吃，是更進了一層的奇慘！我們這奇怪的好吃的民族啊</p>
<h3>四川和四川人</h3>
<p>— 劉陵</p>
<p>四川是一個出產非常豐富的省份，本省的人每每引「天府之國」或「抗戰的復興地」以為榮。不過我曾聽見一個偏見太深的外省人，氣憤地說過。「算了罷，出產雖多也沒有用，糖不甜，鹽不鹹，橘子沒有橘子味。……」這當然是近乎無聊的毀謗。誰也不能要求一個地方的出品，項項够得上美好和標準。我愛四川的廣柑，磁器口的小花生，成都的裝飾品和小吃，以及那種獨特的地方情調。</p>
<p>一般講來整個四川地方的風景很好，有山有水，樹木茂盛。許多地名，如海棠溪，烟雨堡，紅豆樹等，就可以說明這一點。在語文上的表現，有智識的人說起話來「有些文乎文乎」的，特別風雅。出漂亮的女人，但是普通的女性都是矮胖子——有人呌做水桶」。</p>
<p>我很佩服四川人的口才。有時一個智識很低的人，講起話來「頭頭是道」，頗能自圓其說。在四川各地，茶館特別來得多，生意相當興隆。評理，做生意，會談，吃荼擺龍陣（閒扯）都在那裏進行。每天有多少人坐茶館，說話，度過了時光。</p>
<p>除掉了一般可惡的奸商和勢利人以外，四川人很有禮貌，舊道德的觀念很深。他們是比較保守，貪小安閒，或多或少還有點排外的心理存在着。</p>
<h3>藝文壇</h3>
<p>成都的翻譯空氣頗爲濃厚。現居住在成都的文藝翻譯者，有「左拉傳」的譯者林如，一紅與黑」的譯者羅玉君，此外如羅念生，謝文炳。陳翔鶴·陳煒謨等·都是從事翻譯工作的人。內羅王君是女作家，曾留學法國，對於法國文學造詣頗深。</p>

<h3>「金字塔」</h3>
<p>— 飛塵</p>
<p>一位美國航空公司的負責人，在陝西西安東南荒山間，發現巨型「金字塔」一座，這座「金字塔」的歷史，恐怕直到目前爲止，沒有人可以答覆。</p>
<p>或許有人又得用「阿Ｑ」的心情，向人家宣揚中國國古之豐富，不是任何文化先進國家所可比據的。</p>
<p>五千年的古國，飛機的原理，炸藥的發明，不都是「黃臉孔」「拖辮子」的華夏後裔發明的麽？</p>
<p>一座「金字塔」又算得了什麽？埃及有「金字塔」，現在你看：中國也有「金字塔」！而且據這位美國航空公司上校的報導，這座巨型「金字塔」，如若拿埃及的金字塔與牠相較，眞要「相形失色」，中國人聽聽，誰不應該：「眉飛色舞」！</p>
<p>但是可憐的是，中國人生來又「窮」，又「忙」，一座「高約一千呎，週圍一千五百呎」的「金字塔」，埋藏於陝南荒山間，已不知多少年代！</p>
<p>如若沒有外國飛機飛經這「荒山」上空，即使再隔半世紀或一世紀以後，是不是能發現這座「金字塔」，我們也難下定諭。</p>
<p>怪則怪我們的人民，五十年來忙得轉不過身，窮得透不過氣，誰去理會什麼「金字塔」！</p>
<p>現在這座「稀世寳藏」終於被發現了，不知我們這班窮忙的民族，有沒有這種餘暇，去做「踏勘」「考古」的工作。</p>
<h3>天才多能音樂家</h3>
<p>— 倪秋萍</p>
<p>大槪因爲我自己是低能吧，否則何以覺得一般天才者和多能者值得如此崇拜呢？那種才能，非但我想不容易做到，而且是很驚奇的。且說幾個書樂家——：</p>
<p>大音樂家莫札爾德Mozarl，四歲就能作曲了。過去不久的卡魯梭Caruso。是一個傑出的歌唱家，同時還是雕塑家。法西斯惡魔墨索里尼，曾被稱爲意大利第一小提琴家，同時他的文學非常有名。波蘭的政治家革命巨子巴得魯夫斯基Paderewski，他是近代傑出的鋼琴家，並且是作曲家。</p>
<p>現在的小提琴家愛爾受Elman，海飛茲Heifetz，美紐希姆Menuhim，都在十一二幾就表演那艱深的樂曲了。克勒依斯勒Kreisler是久負盛名的小提琴家，他同時是作曲家。他的鋼琴和繪畫也非常地好。不但如此，他還能說八種不同的語言，對於希臘與拉丁文也很有根底的。此外還是數學，哲學和藥物學的研究者。這可眞够得上多才多藝的了。</p>
<p>中國的音樂家馬思聰，他十一歲時就在巴黎公開演奏小提琴。當時歐洲各地的報紙曾用大字標題記載我們這位光榮的的神童。現在他是中國極有名的作曲家和小提琴家。他的鋼琴也是奏得很好的。馬思宏是他的第弟，十三歲已經罷表演巨大的小提琴樂曲——西班牙交嚮曲Latos　Symphonie　Espagnole。小提琴家譚抒眞，也是建築紹。他對於雕塑與西洋盡是非常出色的，尤其對於小提琴的製造和修理，可算十分有研究。</p>
<p>有人說：「天才與多能並不是什麼奇跡，祗要學習與個性適合的學問而沒有走錯路。那便很有希望的，除非康健上有缺點的人。」我們試自問康健上有沒有缺點呢？我們精通那幾稱學間或是技術呢？如果我們自己以爲已經太老了，那麽應請注意自己的孩子吧，他們都是天才和多能的葫芽呢。這非但對於子女盡了很大的責任，更自己的無上光榮。是</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>兩個女人的聲普已展開了劇烈的爭罵，他好奇地走近小窗邊去，推開了兩扇紙糊的板窗。</p>
<p>精外是一條五六尺寬的小巷，巷口通着外面的六合路，巷內和巷底有三四家住戶，都是香港式和上海式的小洋房門上寫着什麼「漱廬」「憩園」之類，向來全住着桂林最舒適的人物——政界要人或銀行經理之類。這時候，老祝側着臉望出去，隱約可以看見巷口正停着一輛大卡車，巷子裏有五六個工人在搬運貨物和箱籠，還有一兩個精明幹練的傢伙在指揮，神情都顯得非常緊張；而聲音最大的却是一羣孩子，大約也有四五個，有吵的。也有哭的，大人根本不管他們。在巷底那所花園洋房的竹籬門外，有兩個女人正提高了聲音，像鬥鷄似的在那裏相持不下。</p>
<p>「……你上一次爲什麼不走？我不管！這一次你們不能上車……」！一個寗波口音的女人斬釘截織地說。</p>
<p>「放屁！這是藥房的車子大家可以坐」！另一個天津口音的女人嗓子也不弱，而潑勁似乎更在寗波女人以上。</p>
<p>「老早　定的話不能不算」！寗波女人立刻予以駁回。「上一次敎你們走；這一次是第二車，講定祗裝我們一家的人。誰也不用想上車！」</p>
<p>天津女人似乎感到理屈，略略頓了一頓。</p>
<p>「你不講理嗎？」她來一個先發制人。「今天風聲這樣緊，你要我們一家四個人死在桂林嗎？一</p>
<p>一哼，我不請理？」對方冷笑了一聲。「你們上一次走的時候，爲什麽不肯帶我們？現在輪到我們了，你又要强佔！這件事萬萬不成！就是你們張先生來，也得講信用上次的話是誰說的？」</p>
<p>「上次也不是我們不要走！」天津女人的思想很敏捷，一會兒又轉出了一個念頭來。「是你們車先生不叚死活的儘　東西，敎我們人也坐不下……」</p>
<p>「東西？不也是　　的東西嗎？」強中還有強中手，　沒女人的念頭　　得比　更快。「你們　　想舒服。上一次不走，你自己說要　小　　，穩　　　緊了，小包　又　不到，更又　　我們　　，真是不要臉！（一三二）</p>

<h3>The Complete Reopening of the Central Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway; Mopping-up Operations Continue; Recovered Taikang and Tongxu in Eastern Henan Province One After Another</h3>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 1st] The National Army advancing north along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway recovered Taian on the afternoon of the 30th. Furthermore, the Wang Yaowu division of the National Army, advancing south from Jinan, recovered the Jieshou Station, 20 kilometers north of Taian, on the afternoon of the 31st. More than 3,000 Communist army guards and demolition squads were completely annihilated. Thus, the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has been completely reopened, and the war situation in central Shandong has entered a new stage.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 1st] The war situation in southern Shandong has taken a sharp turn for the better. The National Army advancing from Feixian towards Mengyin recovered important strongholds such as Zhuman, Yangcheng, and Ligou, 13 kilometers southwest of Qingtuo Temple, on the afternoon of the 30th. In addition, the National Army in Feixian recovered Xiangjiazhuang, southwest of Feixian, on the afternoon of the 30th.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 1st] The northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is still in the deployment stage. On the evening of the 31st, more than 3,000 Communist soldiers raided Chenguantun and Tangguantun. They were repelled by the National Army by the morning of the 1st.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 1st] On the afternoon of the 31st, the National Army launched an eastward attack from Feicheng in western Shandong, breaking into Taian in one fell swoop. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 1st, the scattered resistance of the Communist army in Mount Tai and Jieshou was wiped out, completing the full occupation of Taian. The remaining Communist soldiers fled to the Yimeng Mountain area on the east side, and the National Army is pursuing them.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] With the complete occupation of Taian by the National Army, the central section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has been reopened. Hereafter, only mopping-up operations remain, which need to be completed by the various army corps north and south of Taian.</p>
<p>The Course of Taian City's Recovery; Occupied for a Total of Nine Months and Twenty Days</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 1st] The recovery of Taian has been confirmed by all parties. This time, the National Army's northward corps mainly used a flanking maneuver on the left wing of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, while the Wang Yaowu's southward corps coordinated with a pincer attack. They steadily advanced with overwhelming force, gradually narrowing the encirclement and attacking Taian. The Communist army's entire line was shaken and began to collapse from Taian towards Zulai Mountain, Xintai, and Laiwu in the past few days. The National Army, led by Wang Dijiu, advancing eastward from Feicheng, eliminated resistance along the way and advanced like a broken bamboo, entering the western gate of Taian on the morning of the 31st and launching a mopping-up operation. Taian was completely recovered that evening. Li Guangcun, the magistrate of Taian County, had already entered the city to work on the morning of the 1st. The National Army is now tracking and pursuing the Communist army to the east while mopping up the Communist army in the vicinity and pacifying the local area. The Wang Yaowu's National Army corps has also formally met with the National Army corps advancing north from Jieshou. Thus, the railway between Xuzhou and Jinan has been opened up. The left-wing National Army is also mopping up the Communist army on both sides of the Jinan-Ningyang, Wenshang, Dongping, Dong'a, Pingyin, and Feicheng highways to ensure the traffic line on the highway. According to reports, Taian City was originally garrisoned by local National Army teams after its victory, but it was captured by the Communist army at 12:00 PM on the night of June 10th of last year, for a total of nine months and twenty days until March 31st of this year.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 1st] At the end of last month, the National Army engaged in fierce fighting with more than 2,000 Communist soldiers in the Sishanji, Mota, and Dahoujia areas northeast of Sixian, killing more than 280 soldiers, including He Deming, the puppet magistrate and battalion commander of Sinan County in Si County, and capturing more than 90 people alive. They seized six machine guns and more than one hundred rifles. The remnants of the Communist army retreated to the west of the county, and the National Army is in pursuit.</p>
<p>The Situation in Qingdao Remains Tense; The Number of Communist Soldiers Landing in Yantai and Other Places Is Increasing Daily</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 1st] The situation in Qingdao remains tense. The number of Communist soldiers crossing the sea from Dalian and landing at ports such as Yantai is increasing daily. The Communist army is also actively repairing the coastal highway from Yantai to Jimo and to Weihaiwei, Haidang, and Jimo. On the one hand, this is to strengthen its defensive power on the Jiaodong Peninsula, and on the other hand, it also indicates that its intention to covet Qingdao has not been abandoned.</p>
<p>[United Press, Qingdao, 1st] The general manager of the Qingdao Electric Power Company stated today that since the Jiaoji Railway traffic has been cut off, Boshan coal cannot be transported to Qingdao. The electric power company has about 2,700 tons of coal in storage, which is only enough for one week. If the source is not supplied, it may be forced to cut off power.</p>
<p>[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 1st] The situation in northern Henan is stable. After the Communist army's offensive against Xinxiang was thwarted, it has fallen into the encirclement of the National Army. The 12th and 13th brigades of the 17th Division of the Communist army, which attacked the Xiaoji Station southwest of Xinxiang, have now been surrounded by the National Army and will be completely annihilated soon. In addition, the 1st and 2nd brigades of the 1st Column of the Communist army, which attacked Zhongyi Station, were ambushed by the National Army in the Qiaomiao Laotianshu area on the 31st and suffered heavy losses.

<h3>Bai Chongxi Issues Written Statement Explaining Post-Taiwan Settlement Measures; Those Who Blindly Followed in the Incident Are Allowed to Be Released on Bail</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 1st] Bai Chongxi held a press conference at the Taipei Guest House at 5:00 PM on the 1st and issued a written statement stating: Regarding the post-Taiwan settlement measures, I have decided on the following measures and handed them over to the military and political authorities in Taiwan to implement. Namely: (1) Arrests of criminals must be carried out in accordance with legal procedures; (2) Trials must be fair and speedy; (3) In the event of special major cases, they must be submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for approval before implementation; (4) Arrests of criminals should be handled uniformly by the Garrison Headquarters; (5) The crimes of the criminals sentenced to death should be announced and executed in public to achieve the effect of killing one to warn a hundred. All criminals arrested and detained during the incident, except for the main elements of the communist bandits, should be severely punished according to law. The remaining blind followers, if the circumstances are minor, should be allowed to be released on bail. During the period of cleaning up the countryside, arrests of criminals should also be limited to the main communist bandits and criminals who conceal weapons and ammunition and fail to hand them over. Furthermore, the central government, in order to cherish these youths and give them a chance to start anew so that they may become cadres for building the province and the country in the future, will leniently exempt the young students who were incited and blindly followed the communist bandits during the incident from any punishment. They only need to be lectured by their parents, led to school, and then allowed to return to school to resume classes. Communist bandits who are now fleeing and hiding in various places should also be treated leniently if they know how to repent, surrender their weapons, and surrender. As for the case of the investigators of the Monopoly Bureau who illegally injured and killed people during this incident, the local judicial authorities have been urged to expedite the judgment to show justice.</p>
<h3>Will Suggest Measures to the Central Government to Govern Taiwan</h3>
<p>In his written statement, Bai stated: Regarding the measures to govern Taiwan in the future, I intend to suggest the following to the central government: In terms of politics: (1) Change the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office to a provincial government. In order to adapt to the environment, the number of members of the provincial government should be slightly increased compared with other provinces, and deputy positions should be added to the various departments and bureaus of the provincial government in order to give priority to selecting Taiwanese talents and cultivating senior political talents. (2) County magistrates and mayors should be allowed to be elected regularly. Before the preparations are completed, the principle should be to select local talents and people with financial resources and prestige to serve as officials. In terms of economy: (1) The heavy industry of Taiwan Province should be state-owned or jointly operated with the province in accordance with the central government's regulations, and the principle should be to raise funds from the majority of Taiwanese people to run it, and to avoid being monopolized or manipulated by a few capitalists inside and outside the province. (2) The public land of Taiwan Province should be leased out in accordance with the "Measures for Leasing Out Public Land in Taiwan Province." The public land should be distributed to Taiwanese people with the ability to cultivate it in order to enrich the people's livelihood and relieve unemployed Taiwanese compatriots. (3) The Monopoly System Currently, there are four types of monopoly goods: tobacco, alcohol, camphor, and matches. Camphor is operated by the province and is not widely distributed. The raw materials for matches are all imported from abroad, and the production value is not very large. After exchanging opinions with the competent authorities, it is planned to abolish the Monopoly Bureau and establish a Tobacco and Alcohol Monopoly Bureau. (4) It is planned to abolish the Trade Bureau immediately and change it to an agency similar to the Materials Supply Bureau. The finished products of provincial industries are exported abroad, or the agency manages it. Private industries can also entrust it to handle it.</p>
<h3>Chairman Jiang Respects Teachers; Hosts Educational Workers in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] In order to comfort the educational administrative workers serving in Nanjing, Chairman Jiang specially designated the Auditorium of the Lizi Society at noon on the 3rd to host a banquet for normal school graduates who have served in the education field for more than 20 years, in order to emphasize respect for teachers. According to statistics from the Municipal Bureau of Education, there are approximately 191 educational workers in the city whose length of service is between 15 and 20 years, approximately 120 people whose length of service is between 20 and 25 years, 34 people whose length of service is between 25 and 30 years, 12 people whose length of service is between 30 and 35 years, and 9 people whose length of service is more than 35 to 40 years. The accurate figures for each school must be sent to the Bureau of Education by the 1st so that preparations can be made.</p>
<h3>Reforming Education in Taiwan Province; Three Points Deserve Urgent Attention</h3>
<p>In terms of education, the education that Taiwanese compatriots received during the more than 50 years of Japanese rule was mainly focused on learning Japanese language and literature. The current reform of education should first pay attention to the following items: (1) The central government should select outstanding teachers to jointly run education, and at the same time encourage Taiwanese students to study in the mainland to cultivate teachers and promote cultural exchange. (2) Social education: It has been found that the broadcasting industry in Taiwan Province is relatively developed. There are more than 100,000 radio receivers in Taiwan Province. In the future, the competent education authorities in Taiwan Province can make planned use of broadcasting to provide social education so that compatriots can learn and promote the Mandarin language competition, so that the language is consistent with the mainland to promote emotional unity. (3) Use electrical education. All films should pay attention to selecting those with national thought and patriotic spirit to stimulate the increase of compatriots' national concept and national consciousness, especially the education problem of the Gaoshan compatriots, which must be paid attention to.</p>
<p>Bai concluded that in the future, in addition to paying attention to the improvement of politics and economy in the guidelines for governing Taiwan, education is the most fundamental. He sincerely hopes that the public education personnel who come to Taiwan from the mainland should stick to their original intentions and serve with peace of mind, and hope that all compatriots will unite sincerely, work together with people from outside the province, and work hard to build Taiwan and build China.</p>

<h3>After Resolving Certain Technical Issues, the Government Will Receive Lushun and Dalian Immediately; National Troops Will Go by Land and Sea</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 1st] The Commander-in-Chief's Office is planning to receive Lushun, Dalian, and Jinzhou, and is organizing a training class for the receiving personnel, intensively studying the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and other issues.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 1st] Regarding the establishment of a Lushun Military Commission by China and the Soviet Union, it is heard that this area may send a team to Lushun within the week, led by a certain Colonel.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 1st] A high-ranking government official stated: When the Chinese government receives the Lushun and Dalian municipal governments, the National troops will simultaneously depart from land and sea to occupy the Dalian area, in order to eliminate the 40,000-strong Communist army in the area. In order to prevent the Communist army from retreating by sea to the Communist-controlled Yantai area in Shandong, it is necessary to dispatch the navy. As for the Chinese government's reception of the municipal governments of Lushun and Dalian, according to the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, there should be no problem. However, as it concerns military security, the date of the government's reception cannot be announced at this time. According to well-informed sources, certain technical issues are currently being negotiated on-site between China and the Soviet Union. Once resolved, the Chinese government can proceed with the reception. Dalian Mayor Xue Sui is scheduled to go to Shenyang on the 4th and will then go to Pulandian. However, the issue of the Chinese Changchun Railway is unrelated to the Dalian issue and will be negotiated and resolved in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 1st] Transformers and other equipment in Dalian are being dismantled by a certain party. It is feared that when we receive it in the future, it will become a world of darkness again.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Moscow, 1st] TASS today denied Chinese newspaper reports that Soviet authorities are not allowing Chinese administrative officials to enter Datong, and stated: The Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed to the Chinese government, most recently on March 7, to establish a Datong administrative organization, but has not yet received a response from the Chinese government.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] A person from Dalian said that the Soviet Union notified the government that the Datong to be received only covers a small area south of the tramway line, less than one-tenth of the former Kwantung Leased Territory. The Soviet army is currently transporting materials out of the city and destroying those that cannot be moved. The city is extremely short of materials. Although the Soviet army has repeatedly declared that it will import daily necessities from elsewhere, it is only "hearing the sound of the stairs." The general population still relies on smugglers for daily necessities. The Soviet army's coastal defenses are very sparse. Although checkpoints are densely deployed on the roads, merchants can still pass through with bribes of alcohol. It was also claimed that the equipment of the National troops in Dalian is not much different from that of the Soviet army.</p>

<h3>Mentougou Mine Should Be Nationalized; Representatives of the Company's Industry Union and Members Petition the Authorities, Requesting the Recovery of the Shares of Englishman McBain</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Baoding, 1st] The Mentougou Sino-British Coal Mine was previously approved by the Executive Yuan to return the shares of Englishman McBain. Currently, Zheng Qinglu and Liu Dagang, representatives of the company's industry union members, have submitted a document to the highest authorities, requesting the reversal of this decision, and stating three reasons: (1) In 1942, Englishman McBain went to Shanghai and signed a "Donation Treaty" with the Japanese Shirama, actually losing his ownership and becoming enemy-puppet property. Moreover, this mine concerns national defense resources and should be nationalized. (2) After our country's victory in the Anti-Japanese War, all unequal treaties have been abolished. Coal mines should not be operated by foreigners. Moreover, Mentougou is one of the largest coal mines in North China and should be purchased at its value to avoid losing sovereignty. (3) Englishman McBain, who previously controlled the Sino-British Coal Mine, exploited the interests of the workers. When the Pacific War broke out, he actually signed a treaty with the enemy, constituting the crime of cooperating with the enemy.</p>
<h3>Hegang Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Can Be Mined for a Thousand Years</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 1st] The Hegang Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province, which is as famous as the largest coal mines in the Northeast, such as Xingan (Liaobei Province), Fushun (Liaoning), Beipiao (Jehol), and Fuxin (Jehol), had an annual output of 600,000 tons during the enemy-puppet period, with a daily output of about 1,700 tons. According to geological surveys, the coal seam of this mine is very old. In the past, when excavating coal pits, fossils of elephant tusks were found. After electrical exploration, it was found that the coal seam was more than 3,000 feet deep. It is estimated that the coal reserves reach more than 700 million tons. At an annual output of 600,000 tons, the mine can be mined for a thousand years. The coal seam is close to the ground, so the mine can be mined by both open-pit (i.e., so-called open-pit) and pit methods, making it a very promising coal mine in the country. Heilongjiang Province has the richest coal reserves. In addition to Hegang, there are also Mishan Sanxing and Muleng mines. The coal produced by the Mishan mine is coking coal, which can be used for smelting ore.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Should Cherish the Friendly Feelings of the Chinese People</h3>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall have both responded to the letter from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov of March 24. Foreign Secretary Bevin stated solemnly in his reply that the United Kingdom adheres to a policy of non-interference in China, and has no representatives stationed in North China, so it cannot provide any information. Although Marshall's reply has not been made public, according to the Moscow dispatch of the United Press, the content of the letter does not contain anything surprising, only recounting the efforts made by the United States in mediation in China, and the circumstances of the US military withdrawing from China. Therefore, no matter what statement the Soviet Union will issue, the international wave caused by Molotov's request for the Council of Foreign Ministers to discuss the China issue may have come to an end.</p>
<p>Molotov's suggestion at the opening of the Moscow Council of Foreign Ministers to request the Council of Foreign Ministers to discuss the China issue not only aroused the indignation of the Chinese people, but also made people with a sense of justice in various countries feel injustice. This suggestion, which was close to humiliating China, could not be accepted by the foreign ministers of Britain and the United States. Foreign Secretary Bevin proposed a compromise solution, advocating that the China issue be discussed informally outside the meeting by the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At the same time, Marshall also insisted on his consistent position that the China issue could not be discussed without the participation of Chinese representatives. Molotov also knew that his suggestion was completely unreasonable, and had to change his tune, abandoning his original suggestion, and instead agreeing with Foreign Secretary Bevin and Marshall to informally discuss the China issue outside the meeting by the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and also expressing his agreement to sending representatives from China to participate in the discussion. However, the Chinese government, considering that domestic affairs should not be interfered with by other countries, also solemnly declared to the four powers of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union through diplomatic channels on the 14th that China would never send representatives to participate in the discussion of the China issue, whether it was inside or outside the meeting. As a result, the secret agreement established by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union to discuss the China issue was once again canceled by the solemn declaration of the Chinese government. Foreign Secretary Bevin and Marshall then replied to Molotov, unanimously expressing their opposition to discussing the China issue inside or outside the meeting. However, Marshall proposed a compromise solution, advocating that the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union exchange information on China in writing with each other before April 1, and send a copy to China. Molotov felt that he could not achieve anything alone, and had to agree to Marshall's suggestion, and on the 24th sent letters to Foreign Secretary Bevin and Marshall, on the one hand expressing his agreement with Marshall's suggestion to exchange information on China in writing with each other before April 1, and send a copy to the Chinese government; but on the other hand, he still expressed that he was not completely satisfied with this kind of procedure, and still hoped to discuss the China issue. Foreign Secretary Bevin immediately issued a statement after receiving the two letters: the United Kingdom cannot provide any information. Marshall's reply has also been submitted, and the content is expected to be released within a few days. It is reported that the Soviet Union is not very satisfied with this, but in any case, the wave caused in the international arena by Molotov's request to discuss the China issue can finally be regarded as coming to an end.</p>
<p>Molotov's request for the four-nation foreign ministers' conference to discuss the China issue, no matter how it is interpreted, is ultimately a great insult to China, which damages China's dignity and honor. The roar of the Chinese people and their protests to the Soviet Union are a natural expression of the people's concern for the country. When we speak or write in anger, we inevitably become emotional and go to extremes; but now, calmly thinking back, we still feel a lot of emotions.</p>
<p>First, Molotov's action, in itself, certainly had a great effect. On the one hand, he wanted to strike at China's status to stimulate the Chinese people; and on the other hand, he also attempted to launch a preemptive diplomatic offensive against the United States as a condition for obtaining American concessions on the issue of other claims. But Molotov's diplomatic offensive proved to be a failure. Molotov not only overreached himself, but his "haughty beginning and humble end" really had the demeanor of a diplomat. We always feel that the Soviet diplomacy of wartime assistance repeatedly makes the same mistakes, giving the world a bad impression, and unanimously believing that the Soviet Union is a country that values rights and interests and neglects credibility. This realistic approach is enough to hinder cooperation between countries and the Soviet Union, because the international community, like human society, naturally wants to make friends with people who value credibility the most; conversely, if they do not pay attention to credibility, but only seek profit everywhere, then everyone will stay away from them and dare not get close to them. Most of those who end up isolated in society are people who do not value credibility. Therefore, we want to advise Molotov that if the Soviet Union is a truly peace-loving country that wants to lead the countries of the world in creating peace, then the Soviet Union's restoration of its credibility in the international arena is an absolutely indispensable prerequisite.</p>
<p>Second, post-war Soviet diplomacy everywhere adopts a preemptive posture. In the Soviet Union, it considers itself to be in an active position, able to advance and retreat with ease, but this kind of diplomatic style is most likely to break the harmonious atmosphere in the international arena. Molotov threw bombs at the international arena, not hesitating to cause a huge wave, not starting from today; Molotov has repeatedly caused embarrassment to people in previous international conferences, not only this time treating China like this. Therefore, we believe that the post-war international situation is uneasy. Soviet diplomacy disregards the overall situation and often acts rashly, and cannot but bear considerable responsibility. Soviet newspapers often boast: the Soviet Union is a truly peace-loving country, and its contribution to the creation of world peace is the greatest. We are certainly unwilling to spoil the Soviet people's mood and express dissent; but we hope that the Soviet Union can truly place international security and world peace as the most important things in the future.</p>
<p>Third, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State Marshall are in a posture. In the Soviet Union, it considers itself to be in an active position, selfishly thinking, which is really admirable. From beginning to end, they firmly maintained their consistent just position, and especially we Chinese people are endlessly grateful.</p>
<p>Fourth, we not only have no prejudices against the Soviet Union, but are very willing to be friends with the Soviet Union. Our country spared no expense to conclude the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the Soviet Union, which is an excellent proof. This time, the Chinese people protested and demonstrated against the Soviet Union, not as an anti-Soviet movement, but only to oppose Molotov's suggestion to insult China in the foreign ministers' conference. Now that this wave has become a thing of the past, and Molotov also knows that he has overreached himself and stepped back step by step, we can no longer be emotional and hold grudges forever. Therefore, we still hope that after a storm between China and the Soviet Union, they can become closer and more friendly. We have nothing to ask of the Soviet Union, but we hope that the Soviet Union can earnestly fulfill the Sino-Soviet Alliance Treaty and hand over Dalian and Lushun to the Chinese government for takeover, which is a major test of whether the Soviet Union is fulfilling the Alliance Treaty.</p>
<p>In short, although we have not yet read the statement that the Soviet Union should issue on the China issue; but in any case, the Soviet Union must pay special attention to the friendly feelings of our 450 million people. And it is not difficult for the Soviet Union to cherish the friendly feelings of the Chinese people, as long as Molotov can accept the lessons of the past and immediately change his diplomatic style, a new page in Sino-Soviet relations can be opened before our eyes.</p>

<h3>Marshall Reiterates the US Position: Insists on German Economic Unification; Opposes Extracting Reparations from German Production</h3>
<p>[Our News Agency] London, 1st: Broadcast from Moscow: The United States demands that the Soviet Union begin to make concessions on the German issue, otherwise it will indefinitely postpone the negotiations on peace with Germany. When the four foreign ministers initially decide to hold an informal meeting here today, Molotov will take this opportunity to reveal the Soviet Union's response.</p>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 1st] It is believed here in the British and American sides that Marshall's speech will become a turning point in the conference, but the Soviet newspaper remains silent about it. Dulles, a Republican advisor to Marshall who has always been the target of Soviet newspaper attacks, voluntarily requested not to attend today's informal meeting. Observers generally believe that this matter is of great significance, as it is intended to avoid stimulating the Soviet Union as much as possible in order to win its possible concessions. Accompanying Marshall to today's informal meeting were Ambassador Smith and Mr. Cohen.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Moscow, 31st] At today's meeting of foreign ministers, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall reiterated the U.S. opposition to the division of Germany. He said that making Germany permanently divided is dangerous to European and world peace, and that a divided Germany means a divided Europe. The United States' insistence on German unification is precisely because it does not want Europe to be divided. Marshall also expressed regret at the Soviet Union's extraction of German industrial products as reparations, and its use of this as a condition for accepting the principle of economic unification. He said that the Potsdam Agreement did not stipulate such conditions, and the United States firmly opposes this condition. He felt that the Soviet Union seemed to have the intention of "selling a horse twice." Marshall continued, regarding import and export plans and financial agreements, the countries have already recognized their necessity in principle, but the four powers still need to agree on an agreement to implement political and economic unification, must agree to establish a central administrative body, a provisional German government, agree to the free movement of residents, goods, and ideas within Germany, abolish barriers between zones, and share the temporary budgetary differences of each zone. Marshall also stated that after the agreement is reached, it must be fully complied with, and the Potsdam Agreement can no longer be implemented only partially. Rather than having an agreement that cannot be implemented, it is better not to make an agreement at all. In short, the situation of implementing the Potsdam Agreement must never be repeated. Marshall then mentioned the conditions put forward by France regarding coal, saying that France is not a part of the Potsdam Agreement, so its demands cannot be regarded as conditions for negotiation. Marshall then outlined the position of the U.S. delegation, declaring support for the establishment of a balanced import and export plan based on the principle of enabling Germans to survive, raising the level of German industry, and making German factory production meet European needs. The United States' support for the principle of German economic unification is precisely to prevent Germany from being divided. A divided Germany will inevitably lead to a situation where each zone governs itself, eventually forming two strong parts, which, once merged, will become a militaristic Germany again.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Bidault then argued about the coal issue and the relationship between the future of the Saar region and German economic unification. He believed that the foreign ministers' conference could not determine the level of industry, the standard of reparations, and economic unification until it had decided on the amount of German coal exports and domestic consumption. The issue of whether the Saar region should be incorporated into the French economic sphere has not been decided, so the issue of German economic unification cannot be decided. Bidault also requested that the possibility of using German industrial products as reparations be reviewed again when discussing the level of German industry.</p>
<h3>Britain Announces Four Principles</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse] Finally, Foreign Secretary Bevin put forward four principles on German economic unification, namely (1) freedom of movement of people, goods, and ideas; (2) balancing import and export trade so that export trade can offset import trade; (3) the four occupying countries jointly bear the burden of occupation; (4) establishing a German central administrative body and granting it executive power. Foreign Secretary Bevin said that the United Kingdom still opposes extracting reparations from Germany's current production, four-power joint management of the Ruhr region, and the cancellation of the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones. Britain supports the economic merger of the Saar region with France, but objects to any formal agreement on German coal exports to France. The four foreign ministers are scheduled to hold a secret meeting tomorrow to continue discussing the issue of German economic unification and the issue of the level of industry.</p>
<h3>Committee of Experts Discusses German Secondary Issues</h3>
<p>Differences of Opinion Among the Four Countries Remain</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 31st] The Committee of Experts established by the Council of Foreign Ministers, responsible for studying all the crucial issues of the peace treaty with Germany, met today. Differences of opinion among the countries remain extreme, no different from the disagreement of the four countries on various important issues. The representatives of the four countries exchanged views thoroughly on the two issues of eliminating Nazis and German political democratization at the Committee of Experts meeting today. France insisted that the scope of German political parties and trade unions should be limited to the provinces, rather than national political parties and trade unions. The United States wants all parties to compete freely, with each party leader responsible for their own actions, and trade unions must also be financially independent. Regarding the electoral system, the Soviet Union insists on its demand to adopt a proportional representation system, but in any case, the Committee of Experts must complete its task on schedule by tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The British Government Publishes the Texts of Three Agreements</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 31st] The Foreign Office has recently published a white paper, publishing the Tehran Agreement of December 1943, the Yalta Agreement of February 1945, and the Potsdam Agreement of July 1945.</p>
<h3>British-Soviet Treaty Revision Negotiations Underway</h3>
<p>British Foreign Trade Minister to Visit the Soviet Union</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 31st] After British and Soviet representatives began negotiations on treaty revision on the 27th of this month, they will meet again tomorrow. Sir Frank Roberts will represent the United Kingdom, and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gusev and Director of the Foreign Affairs Department Golubensky will represent the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 31st] British Foreign Trade Minister Wilson will soon travel to Moscow. According to recent reports, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will meet with Stalin to discuss trade issues between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>World Health Organization Begins Work in China</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Geneva, 31st] The World Health Organization announced at the opening of its third meeting here today that its work in China will begin on April 1.</p>
<p>[Associated Press, Geneva, 31st] The Interim Commission of the International Health Organization today took over the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's health work in China.</p>
<h3>Prince Paul of Greece Inherits the Throne After King George II's Sudden Death</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] London, 1st - A broadcast reports that King George II of Greece died suddenly today from a heart ailment at the age of 56. His brother, Prince Paul, will inherit the throne today at 7:30 PM (Athens time). George II was twice exiled and only recently reassumed the throne last year after a public referendum. At the time, the Greek Communist Party strongly attacked the referendum, deeming it unrepresentative of public opinion, but British and American representatives fully supported it. The King's death adds a new dimension to the still-under-discussion US aid to Greece.</p>
<p>[United Press, Athens, 1st] According to Greek left-wing leaders, the British and American governments both acknowledge the current Greek government's instability. Unless President Truman seizes this opportunity to urge reforms in the Greek government, George's death will not fundamentally change the overall situation. In Washington, Senator George, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the King's sudden death should not alter the US aid to Greece process. Assuming Greece can form a stable government, the King's death may, in some ways, assist the process.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Albanian Dispute to be Submitted to the Hague Tribunal</h3>
<p>[Agence Nouvelle de Presse, Lake Success, 31st] A high-ranking British official revealed today that the British delegation to the Security Council has proposed submitting the Anglo-Albanian dispute to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. The British accusation that Albania laid mines in the Corfu Channel remains on the Security Council's agenda. However, due to the Soviet Union's veto on the matter last week, the issue will not be revisited until after the Pacific former Japanese mandated islands issue is resolved. British sources state that if the Security Council cannot reach a decision on this matter, submitting it to the International Court is perfectly logical.</p>
<h3>Marshall and Stalin May Meet This Week; Molotov Receives Stettinius</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 31st] It is learned that Stettinius, a Republican candidate for the 1948 US presidential election, is preparing to visit the Ural Mountains. Stettinius requested a meeting with Stalin after arriving here, but it is understood that this meeting can only take place after Stettinius returns from the Ural Mountains. In addition, Stalin is expected to receive US Secretary of State Marshall for talks within the week.</p>
<p>[TASS, Moscow, 31st] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with prominent US Republican leader Stettinius today for talks.</p>
<h3>Atomic Energy Commission Subcommittee Passes French Proposal</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 1st] The drafting subcommittee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission adopted the French delegation's proposal yesterday, stipulating that the subcommittee immediately review the differing opinions in the committee's reports. The vote was ten to zero, with the Soviet Union and Poland abstaining. Sources say this is the first concrete step toward establishing an international body to control atomic energy.</p>
<h3>Vandenberg Proposes Amendments Regarding US Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan Aiming to Harmonize US Relations with the United Nations</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 31st] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today proposed three restraining measures for President Truman's $400 million aid package to Greece and Turkey. One provision stipulates that UN agencies have the power to halt secondary aid, but the Soviet Union cannot use its veto power to obstruct US action. If a UN agency wants to block it, the Security Council or the General Assembly must vote on it as a procedural matter rather than a substantive one. In other words, a majority of seven out of the eleven members of the Security Council is required, and the veto power of the five permanent members does not apply. In the General Assembly, such a vote requires a majority of twenty-eight out of fifty-five votes. Vandenberg told the press that his amendment was intended to show that the US intends to act within the spirit of UN agencies. In fact, Vandenberg's proposal is equivalent to the US being willing to relinquish its voting rights when it encounters any obstacles in the aid to Greece and Turkey plan. Voting on "substantive" issues in the Security Council requires unanimity among the five major powers, each having the power to veto. According to Vandenberg's intention, the US is willing to abide by a majority vote, even if it violates US policy. If the US asks the UN agency itself to decide on aid to Greece and Turkey, the Soviet Union or other major powers could use their veto power to block it. Republican Senator Taft endorsed Vandenberg's amendment, and Democratic Senator George called it "a step in the right direction." Vandenberg's amendment also stipulates that the President should revoke all or any aid to Greece and Turkey in the following two situations: (1) If the government of either Greece or Turkey requests it, provided that such government represents the majority faction in that country; (2) If the President finds that the aid objective has been largely completed or cannot be completed. Republican Congressman Crawford, in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, stated that the US should warn the Soviet Union to disarm, otherwise the US would not hesitate to confront it with atomic bombs and economic power. If the Soviet Union intends to obstruct, it is equivalent to starting a war, and if war breaks out, the Soviet Union will suffer a severe blow.</p>
<h3>Britain, at the Request of the United States, Continues to Aid Greece</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 31st] It has just been learned from responsible sources here that the British aid to Greece plan, originally scheduled to end today, will continue at the request of the United States until US aid to Greece takes effect. The US aid to Greece bill is still under discussion in Congress, and London sources hope that this plan will be passed by the US Congress before the end of April. As for the transitional period of British aid, it should be minimized in scope, and officials are certain that such aid will not be of any military nature.</p>
<h3>New US Ambassador Nominees to Yugoslavia, Portugal, and Poland</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 31st] President Truman today nominated and appointed Mr. Cannon as the US Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Mr. Wiley as the Ambassador to Portugal, and Mr. Griffin as the Ambassador to Poland.</p>
<h3>Sweden Replies to US Protest Regarding Import Restrictions</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 31st] The US previously protested to Sweden regarding the imposition of import restrictions. Sweden's reply has been delivered to the State Department. It is understood that the reply is moderately worded, but it emphasizes that the situation has changed dramatically since the establishment of the US-Sweden reciprocal trade agreement in 1935. Sweden stated that there is no discrimination against the US in the implementation of general import restrictions and is willing to negotiate with the US government on the issue of implementing import restrictions.</p>
<h3>Franco Suddenly Announces Spain as a Monarchy and Declares That He Will Be the Head of State for Life</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 1st] Radio Madrid broadcast General Franco's speech last night, announcing Spain as a monarchy, with Franco as the head of state, and the establishment of a regency council. The previous monarchy in Spain ended in 1931 when city councils in major Spanish cities voted in favor of establishing a republic. King Alfonso XIII abdicated and went abroad, never returning. Radio Madrid also announced the monarchy law today, declaring Spain as a kingdom, with the head of state named "Chief of State." It stated that the regency council should assist the Chief of State in handling all affairs. The regency council is composed of the National Archbishop or the most prominent Archbishop, the Chief of Staff, the President of the State Council, and the President of the Supreme Court. In addition, members of parliament representing labor unions, local administration, university presidents, and professional associations each nominate one representative to participate in the regency council. The law also clearly stipulates that no king will be established before Franco's death or loss of capacity. It further states that upon the death or incapacity of the Chief of State, a person of royal blood may be established as the Chief of State upon the recommendation of the regency council and the government, with the consent of two-thirds of parliament. If no one meets these conditions, or their nomination is rejected by parliament, a regent may be appointed to act as the Chief of State.</p>
<h3>The "Sidistes" Express Opposition</h3>
<p>[United Press, Madrid, 1st] The "Sidistes" consider Franco's plan "completely unacceptable." Their reasons for disapproval are: (1) Restrictions on the qualifications of the head of state; (2) Preservation of the real power of the current parliament and the Falange, which the monarchists want to eliminate; (3) This plan extends Franco's term of office indefinitely. They also claim that the purpose of this plan is to prevent the direct mobilization of monarchists, complete the restoration, and ensure that Franco continues to wield great power.</p>
<h3>Reactions in Britain and the US Mostly Express Dissatisfaction</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 1st] The US State Department declined to comment on Franco's statement regarding Spain. According to one diplomat, if the Spanish army decides that the time has come to restore the Spanish Empire, Franco, as a soldier, should obey orders, as the army appointed him as leader during the Spanish Civil War. The diplomat also stated that if this is the case, the restoration of the Empire is possible, because the victory of the Allies in the Great War gave the army an overwhelming advantage over the Falange.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 1st] A Foreign Office spokesman stated: "The political system of Spain must be freely decided by the people and cannot be forced by Franco. Only after Franco and his regime are eliminated can Britain adopt a compromise attitude toward Spain."</p>
<h3>Underground Train Collision in Japan; More Than 100 Passengers Killed and Injured</h3>

<h3>Haifa Oil Depot Fire Unextinguished</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Jerusalem, 31st] After rioters bombed and ignited the Shell Oil Company's oil depot in Haifa, the fire raged fiercely. Two thousand soldiers from the army and navy, naval firefighters, army firefighters, and firefighters from Haifa City and the oil company were all dispatched to extinguish the fire for fifteen hours before cutting it off to prevent it from continuing to spread. Officials estimate the loss at one million pounds and expect to burden Palestinian taxpayers with compensation, as was done after the bombing of the King David Hotel.</p>
<h3>Conservatives Support Government Proposal; Britain Will Extend Conscription Law; Some Labor MPs Still Dissent</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 31st] The House of Commons began the second reading of the Conscription Bill this afternoon. For the first time, the Conservatives helped the government defend against the opposition of a few Labor MPs and Liberal MPs.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 31st] Churchill today led the Conservatives in supporting Prime Minister Attlee's suppression of the rebellion within the Labor Party against extending the Conscription Bill to 1954. Churchill declared that "we admire the courage of the Labor leaders in resisting the conspiracies and corrupt elements in the party." Seventy-seven Labor MPs have introduced a bill to repeal the Conscription Bill. Attlee urged party unity at a secret meeting of Labor MPs this morning. However, well-informed sources state that forty to fifty party members will still vote against extending the Conscription Bill. The law stipulates that 200,000 young men aged 18 to 26 will be conscripted into the army, navy, and air force each year. Minister of Labor Isaacs opened the debate in the House of Commons today, saying that Britain's military strength has been reduced to a serious stage and strongly advocated passing the bill to save it. He also said, "Unless we take some steps to remedy this defect, we will be in a very difficult situation." The debate will last two days and be voted on tomorrow night.</p>
<p>[United Press, London, 31st] After Opposition Leader Churchill stated that the Conservative Party would fully support the Labor government's Conscription Bill, the passage of the bill became a certainty. Churchill also stated that he had proposed a conscription bill in 1933 to cope with the threat of Nazism, which was opposed by the Labor Party at the time, but this time he was happy to support the Labor Party's conscription bill to defend against "another crisis, another dictatorship." Churchill's so-called "another crisis" implicitly refers to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Hodge Has Returned to Seoul; Numerous Difficulties Between US and Soviet Occupation Zones in Korea</h3>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 1st] Lieutenant General Hodge, Commander of the US Forces in southern Korea, flew back to his post in Seoul today.</p>
<p>[United Press, San Francisco, 31st] Lieutenant General Hodge, Commander of the US Forces in southern Korea, returned to his post today after a month in the US. He passed through here and reviewed the difficulties between the US and Soviet occupation zones in Korea at a press conference. It is said that if the US lacks interest and withdraws from Korea, it will have a serious impact on Asia. Hodge also said that he had discussed the matter with Secretary of State Marshall before he went to Moscow, but he could not explain the content. The provisional parliament sponsored by the US military in southern Korea has made progress in drafting an election law. Once the bill is completed, it is planned to elect a formal parliament in the US occupation zone as a first step toward democracy. The election date has not been determined. Hodge continued that there is no doubt that the Soviet occupation zone in northern Korea now has a Korean army under Soviet control, but the recently reported number of 500,000 in Washington is a misunderstanding. The 500,000 he estimated at the Washington meeting was the possible maximum number. For internal security purposes, the US military occupation zone in southern Korea is organizing a small-scale elite police force, the training of which is so good that some US troops sometimes go to observe.</p>
<h3>Korea Prepares Grand Welcome for Seo Jae-pil's Return</h3>
<p>[Asia Press, Seoul, 1st] Since General Lerch announced the news of Dr. Seo Jae-pil's return to Korea, the provisional legislative parliament has selected Speaker Kim Kyu-sik, Deputy Speaker Yoon Ki-byun, and two others to prepare the welcome and will reportedly go to the airport to welcome him in person. Seo organized the "Independence Association" in Korea after 1895 and made many contributions to the Korean independence movement. Seo has now acquired US citizenship. General Lerch announced that Seo's return to Korea is only to assist the advisory group and that he has no ambitions for Korean politics.</p>
<h3>US Establishes Selective Service Record Bureau After Repealing Wartime Conscription Law</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st] The wartime conscription law, which conscripted over 10 million US citizens into the army to fight in World War II, officially expired today. President Truman immediately established a Selective Service Record Bureau to manage the registers of 44 million registered US citizens, to be used in the event of another war to conscript them into the army to serve the country.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] Officials announced today the appointment of representatives from 18 major industries as members of the Industrial Mobilization Committee to assist the Army and Navy Munitions Bureau in preparing a national industrial mobilization plan, thus entering a more intense stage of the US post-war military preparation plan.</p>
<p>US Ambassador to Turkey Wilson returned to the US from Istanbul on March 24 to report to the State Department. (Special Dispatch from the New York Times)</p>

<h3>Gui Yongqing Personally Comes to Shanghai to Investigate the "Fubo" Warship Tragedy Will Transfer to the Accident Location in Xiamen Within Days to Investigate Relevant Investigative Personnel Held Review Meeting Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The sinking tragedy of the "Fubo" warship shocked the international community and the Naval Headquarters expressed particular concern, dispatching three personnel to Shanghai to investigate and offer condolences within a week. Gui Yongqing, acting Commander-in-Chief of the Department, personally came to Shanghai to investigate yesterday and will transfer to the accident location in Xiamen within days to investigate. It is understood that the Naval Headquarters has received a telegram from Xiamen stating that fishing boats have rescued more than twenty survivors, but their names have not yet been ascertained. As for the list of all the officers and soldiers who died, it will be announced in Beijing. To avoid excessive stimulation for the relatives of the deceased, individual notification may be adopted. The Department is considering it. Also, Ruan Chengzhang, Director of the Second Division of the Department, who came to Shanghai to offer condolences to the families of the deceased officers and soldiers, has not yet completed his condolence work. He was ordered to return to Beijing last night.</p>

<h3>Former French Municipal Council Accounts Missing; Difficulties in Calculating Savings of Chinese Employees; The Cleaning Committee's French Concession Subgroup Met Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The French Concession Subgroup of the Shanghai Municipal Former Public Works Bureau's Official Assets and Obligations Cleaning Committee held its fifth meeting at the Land Administration Bureau yesterday afternoon. Attendees included Zhu Ping, Zha Liangjian, Zhang Yishu, Xiao Jianrong, Sun Kuifang, French representatives Greed, Tuffin, Gu Ruiliang, Father Moorey, Yang Zuoying, and French representative Xue Huali, among others. The issue of the refund of savings for Chinese employees of the former French Municipal Council was discussed, but no results were obtained. It is understood that this issue of savings for Chinese employees of the former Municipal Council is different from that of the Public Works Bureau. The Public Works Bureau has accounts to check, while the accounts of the Municipal Council are still missing. According to the regulations of the French Municipal Council Chinese Employee Savings Association on July 8, 1931, savings were deducted from employees' monthly salaries at a rate of 5%, and the Municipal Council subsidized 5% of the monthly salary, in addition to paying interest. According to the literal interpretation of this regulation, there should be a sum of money in existence. However, according to the French side, the savings association for Chinese employees was different from the savings association for European employees. The latter was an autonomous organization that received subsidies from the Municipal Council and contributions from employees, and deposited the funds in the bank, preparing to pay them upon retirement. However, the savings of Chinese employees did not have any special organization. The funds paid were recorded by the Municipal Council itself, and it undertook to add the interest that should be obtained at the interest rate stipulated in the annual budget when paying. When the Municipal Council Board of Directors resolves the budget each year, it shall stipulate the interest rate that the savings association will receive in the following year, and so on. The subgroup now acknowledges the debt owed to the former Chinese employees of the Municipal Council, but wants to find out whether the savings were deducted at that time, and if so, where the funds are now. The current concern is that the relevant accounts of the French Municipal Council are no longer available. The French side claims to have transferred them to the puppet government, but the municipal government did not receive the files after the victory. According to the subgroup, if it is determined that there were no deductions at that time, then funds should be raised to repay. Then, the discussion and repayment multiple and calculation date should begin.</p>
<h3>Chinese Employees of US Warship "Wake" Demand Compensation</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The US gunboat "Wake" was moored on the Huangpu River when the Pacific War broke out on December 8, 1941, and was detained by the Japanese army. The personnel on board, including Captain Smith and more than twenty Chinese sailors, stewards, etc., were all detained in concentration camps. They were only released when the Japanese surrendered in August 1945. The more than twenty Chinese employees, seeking compensation, had Captain Smith come forward to ask the Social Affairs Bureau to request the US Navy Department's Shanghai Office to issue it. However, the Social Affairs Bureau refused to accept it, citing that this was a matter for the seamen's side.</p>
<h3>Establishing a Guangdong War Plan: Display and Exhibition</h3>

<h3>Civil Affairs Director States: Postponement of Conscription Investigation; Preparations Not Yet Ready</h3>

<h3>China Fortune Zhong Company: Organization and Business Overview</h3>
<p>Since the Associated Press disclosed the news that China Fortune Zhong Company enjoys special privileges for China's import and export trade, various newspapers have published reports on the matter. To clarify the truth, the reporter visited Mr. Qian Xinzhi, Chairman of the company, who provided the following information: Q: Who are the shareholders of China Fortune Zhong Company, and what is the capital? A: China Fortune Zhong's capital is 300 million yuan in national currency, invested by the Bank of Communications, Jin Cheng Bank, China National Products Bank, and other banks. There are no private shares. All directors and supervisors are elected by representatives of each bank. Q: What was the motive for establishing China Fortune Zhong Company? A: When the victory of the War of Resistance arrived, the whole country eagerly hoped for the early realization of postwar reconstruction and nation-building. The Bank of Communications and other banks believed that in the future, our country must import a large amount of production raw materials and equipment, as well as inexpensive transportation vehicles, and at the same time, export a large number of our country's local products to exchange for foreign exchange. However, before the war, there were not many complete import and export organizations organized by our own people. Therefore, they gathered and discussed the establishment of China Fortune Zhong Company. Q: When was the company established, and what was its past business like? A: Fortune Zhong began preparations in the winter of 1945 and was officially established in January 1946, but business started on May 1st. Because it was at the beginning of its establishment, business was not as smooth as expected. In the past year, it had the following import and export goods: (1) Purchased three rounds of Lin Ge, Zizhong, and Deng Yu on behalf of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at a very low price. Fortune Zhong did not charge any handling fees or any profit, and even telegraph and insurance fees were not charged. (2) Imported hundreds of low-priced versatile jeeps and dozens of travel vehicles. (3) The largest export volume was tung oil. In addition, sporadic imports included wireless radio equipment, auto parts, steel ball tools, and a batch of timber ordered by the Central Air Transport Corporation. Q: Has the company imported any luxury goods since its establishment? A: China Fortune Zhong Company's application for import and foreign exchange settlement procedures are all handled in accordance with government regulations and are exactly the same as other import and export merchants.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding the news item "Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Commits Suicide by Drowning" published in your newspaper on March 25th, the content does not match the facts. The TCM practitioner Lin Zongjing has resided in　for years. I did ask him to move some months ago, but there was no so-called "failure to move, followed by a beating," nor did I "close the gates, preventing patients from entering," obstructing his practice. Furthermore, Kunshan is not a brothel owner. That brothel was established by the tenant Chen Jinshan, and the brothel has a license, proving it has nothing to do with Kunshan. I was not coercing him. For the sake of my personal reputation, I specifically request your newspaper to make a correction to clarify the responsibility and distinguish right from wrong. Sincerely, Shao Kunshan.</p>
<p>To the Editor: We are writing on behalf of our client, Zhang Benda, who states that he read in the Shen Bao on March 27th an article titled "Bail for Chen Boluo's Escapees Subjected to Further Scrutiny," which stated, "Subsequently, the High Court discovered new evidence of Chen Bofan's crimes in another case and dispatched two court police officers to Zhang Benda's residence to arrest Chen Bowen. Unexpectedly, Zhang prevaricated with the court police while informing Chen's family." This does not correspond to the facts. The traitor Chen Bofan was sentenced to one year and three months in prison by the High Court. When his sentence expired on January 1st of this year, he was released on bail. His mother, Ms. Liang Song, begged Zhang Benda's mother to ask Benda to serve as his guarantor because it was difficult to refuse the request at the time. Unexpectedly, on February 2nd, court police officers from the High Court went to Chen Bofan's residence at No. 1, Lane 215, Rue Cardinal Mercier (i.e., Shen Hua's house) to summon him without success, then went to Muda's place to ask the guarantor to hand him over. They immediately joined forces with another guarantor, Kong　Jiu, to help search for him. The facts are all there. The guarantor had no　knowledge of the escape of the person he guaranteed, and he himself suffered　. The statement mentioned above, "Zhang prevaricated with the court police while informing Chen's family," is completely inconsistent with the facts. Please issue a correction in the Shen Bao to avoid confusion. Respectfully submitted, Lawyer Zhu Fangyi.</p>
<h3>Two Grass Shed Fires, Six Deaths in Zhabei</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] At around 10:30 PM the night before last, a fire broke out at the grass shed of Yu Junnian's family at No. 12 Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, due to carelessness. Black smoke billowed and flames soared, and within moments, over ten grass sheds in the vicinity were engulfed in flames. The fire was extinguished in about two hours. Because it was late at night, residents were unable to escape, resulting in ten deaths and injuries. An investigation revealed that the dead included: Chen, the mother of the fire's source, Que Junnian (62 years old), Chen Caifu, Chen Guanquan, Wei Duozi, Cao Shihai, and his wife, Mo. Four people were burned: Que Junnian, Huang Zhicong, Qian Shunmo, and Huang Wenjiang.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 10:25 AM, a fire broke out at a paint signboard shop at No. 57 Tongji Road after gasoline and paint were spilled. The fire quickly spread and became uncontrollable. In addition to the destruction of the building, it also spread to over twenty nearby grass sheds. The fire was extinguished in about two hours, but fortunately, no one was injured.</p>

<h3>Reader Consultation Service Legal Questions</h3>
<p>(1) Unauthorized Opening of Mail</p>
<p>Pu Tou Yong Kang Company asks: Our company received an important letter from a certain firm in an import port on October 6th of last year. Upon receipt, we discovered that the letter had been opened by someone else. We immediately approached the agency that delivers the letter on their behalf, and the agency's staff admitted it outright. We have legal questions and would appreciate your answers: (1) Is it illegal for the agency to overcharge for postage and demand handling fees? (2) Is it illegal to open other people's mail without authorization? (3) Is it illegal for the agency to have inconsistent delivery schedules and often deliberately delay deliveries?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) If it is true that the agency overcharges for postage and demands handling fees, then in addition to violating postal regulations, they are suspected of criminal activity. They have violated the criminal law regarding fraud and dereliction of duty, and their actions constitute "using one's position to fraudulently obtain property" under Article 3, Paragraph 5 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption. (2) Unauthorized opening of mail is regulated by Article 41 of the Postal Law. Punishment will be based on Article 315 of the Criminal Law. (3) You can report them to the competent post office. According to Article 5 of the Regulations on Postal Agencies, if an agent handles matters poorly or violates regulations, they should be replaced immediately, and if they are suspected of criminal activity, they should be handed over to the judicial authorities for review.</p>
<p>Security Deposit Question</p>
<p>A reader of ten years asks: In 1935, I leased a house from someone for a term of six years. The security deposit was 200 silver dollars, and the monthly rent was $4.50. When the lease expired in 1941, we agreed to renew for another five years, with the security deposit remaining the same and the rent increasing by $10 per month. Later, the rent was further increased by $15 in government bonds, and then again by two measures of rice, up to the present day. Now that the lease term has expired, I have the following questions and would appreciate your answers:</p>
<p>(1) When returning the security deposit, what is a reasonable proportion to return the original $200, or should it be returned based on the rice price at the time?</p>
<p>(2) Would it be reasonable to demand a refund based on the cost of living index?</p>
<p>(3) Would it be legal to negotiate with the landlord to continue living there based on the original rent of $4.50 per month set in 1935 until the security deposit is used up?</p>
<p>[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) No, because what you paid at the time was not "rice." (2) Current law does not have a provision for increasing the refund based on the cost of living index. (3) The security deposit is not prepaid rent, and the rent may increase or decrease at any time due to fluctuations in the value of goods. If a lease has a fixed term, the lease relationship expires when the term is up, as clearly stipulated by law. It is not legal to calculate the rent based on the amount from over ten years ago and live there until the security deposit is used up.</p>

<h3>Zhengda University Student Protest Not Resolved, Everything Transferred to Ministry for Resolution, Students Resumed Classes Yesterday Awaiting Further Instructions</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 1st] The Zhengda University student protest has not yet been resolved, and everything has been transferred to the Ministry for resolution. The students resumed classes yesterday, awaiting further instructions. The School Protection Association has declared that it will continue its work to protect the school and will not stop until its goals are achieved. Cheng Qibao, a specialist from the Ministry of Education, returned to Nanjing to report. According to him, the Zhengda University student protest has complex internal issues and is difficult to mediate. Although classes have resumed, the future is still uncertain. Cheng also said that the school's equipment is indeed simple, but considering that it was established six years ago and has been relocated several times, it is not easy to have its current scale. In the future, it will be necessary to raise large amounts of funds to enrich the internal equipment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai University Students Organize Committee for Reform of School Affairs, Send Letters to Parents Explaining Reasons for Freedom of Entry and Exit, Also Submit Proposal to School to Cancel Point System</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai University student strike was still deadlocked yesterday. The students insisted that they would not return to classes until a resolution was reached. Regarding the previous day's decision by the school board that "the principle of free entry and exit from the school gate is acceptable, but it must be approved by a majority of parents," the students were still not satisfied. Fearing that a majority of parents would not understand the inner workings of the school and would object, and because it would take a long time for letters to be exchanged, the students felt impatient. The students of the school organized the School Affairs Reform Movement Committee. In order to win the sympathy of parents, the committee sent letters to the parents of the students yesterday, detailing the impropriety of the school's punishment of Jin Jialin, a student in the Department of Political Science, for leaving the school gate privately, and the situation of the student strike, hoping that parents would sympathize and support them. The letter explained the reasons for allowing students to enter and exit the school gate freely: "The school calls roll every time there is a class, and the school has strict punishment measures for absenteeism. Our request for free entry and exit will not affect our classes. We only ask to be able to enter and exit freely when we have no classes, and we must return to the dormitory before 9:00 PM, so there will be no bad consequences. Please rest assured, wise parents."</p>
<p>It is also heard that the Shanghai University School Affairs Reform Movement Committee resolved that the strike will continue today, but reading groups will be organized, and Wang Yunsheng, the main writer of the Ta Kung Pao, will give a speech entitled "My View on Japan."</p>
<p>(Another News) Students from the first school of the Shanghai University School of Business held a general assembly of all students at the Wu Liande Hall of the Shanghai Museum the night before last to discuss responding to the students of the Yangshupu Day School to reform school affairs. They resolved not to strike for the time being, and decided on the following important recommendations: (1) Respond to the Yangshupu students and support all their demands. (2) Reiterate the cancellation of the point system. (3) Request that the school cancel the limit of at most 15 credits and at least 12 credits. (4) And cancel the five-year graduation system. Xu Zhendong, chairman of the Shanghai Alumni Association, recently made a statement saying: "I am very sympathetic to this student movement. However, I fear that the students' opinions will cause further complications. At the beginning of the student movement, the Student Union proposed to restore freedom and cancel the punishment of Jin Jun. Now, regarding the first point, the School Huang Association has agreed. As for the latter, Jin Jun and his parents have accepted the punishment, and the second term is about to expire, so there should be no major problem. However, the School Affairs Reform Committee has now proposed to the school to "cancel the point system." If this continues, I am afraid there will be no end to it."</p>

<h3>Respectful Reply to Mr. Deng Gongsan Regarding the National Textbook (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Lu Dianyang</p>
<p>Deng Gongsan's Sunday article published in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on January 26, 1947, made many criticisms of the Ministry of Education-compiled textbooks, which are worthy of attention. However, each point he made should be explained to avoid misunderstandings. 1. Looking at Mr. Deng's entire article, except for the abusive parts that do not need to be debated, it can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) Errors in temporary editions due to misprints, proofreading errors, and inappropriate wording, which have either been corrected in the revised edition or the Shanghai edition and were not seen by Mr. Deng, or the revised edition was delayed by the Qilian Office and is in the process of printing and has not yet been published, so it has not been supplied; (2) Issues that belong to the curriculum standards and not to the textbooks; (3) Whether Mr. Deng's views are appropriate is open to discussion. These are described below:</p>
<p>(1) Errors in the temporary editions that have been largely corrected in the revised edition. For example, the first lesson of the third volume of the revised edition of the senior primary school Chinese textbook has been corrected to "In the Sino-Japanese War, our country was defeated, and the people were angry." The revised editions of the junior high school Chinese and history textbooks were sent to print before May of last year, but have not yet been published, so it is regrettable that schools continue to use the temporary editions! However, the Shanghai edition of the temporary edition has corrected some errors, which is slightly better. The points raised by Mr. Deng have been corrected in the revised edition. The original manuscript is being typeset by the Qilian Office, and it can be reviewed. Even in the Shanghai edition of the temporary edition, some parts have been corrected. For example, Mr. Deng mentioned that Zong Ze and Li Gang of the Song Dynasty "firmly maintained the peace agreement." The ninth line of the forty-fifth page of the third volume of the Shanghai edition of the temporary edition has been corrected to "For example, in the battles between Song, Liao, and Jin, Kou Zhun, Li Gang, and Zong Ze were all able to firmly reject the peace agreement and be upright and unyielding, not to mention the arduous struggles of Han Shizhong and Yue Fei." The Chongqing edition omitted the word "Jin" and mistakenly wrote "rejected" as "maintained," resulting in the opposite meaning. However, the following sentence proves that Li and others were people who rejected peace rather than maintained it. Also, the names "Yelü Dashi" and "Yelü Dashi" of the Western Liao, and the prime minister "Tokto" and "Tuotuo" of the Yuan Dynasty, were originally transliterated nouns. Before the transliteration names were unified, the records in various books may have been different. However, in the Shanghai edition, "Yelü Dashi" has been changed to "Yelü Dashi," see the second to last line of the seventh page and the fourth line of the fiftieth page of the third volume. In the revised edition, "Tokto" has also been changed to "Tuotuo." Also, regarding the Qin Shihuang's burning of books and burying of scholars mentioned by Mr. Deng, the Shanghai edition has long been revised to "...all history books and poetry books, and the language of hundreds of scholars were completely burned. Only the books on medicine, divination, and planting trees were not burned. If the people wanted to learn the law, they could take officials as their teachers. It is said that after the burning of books, hundreds of scholars were buried in Xianyang. This is the story of Qin Shihuang's burning of books and burying of scholars." See the fifth to eighth lines of the eighty-seventh page of the first volume of the Shanghai edition. In the revised edition, the last paragraph of the chapter has been deleted, and the section on burning books and burying scholars has been changed to "However, Shihuang was too eager to seek unification, and his measures became autocratic, and even had the burning of books and burying of scholars." For example, in the junior high school history textbook, the phrase "Yuan Shizu promoted agriculture" in the lesson on Yuan and Ming society, "Shizu" was mistakenly printed as "Taizu." It has also been corrected in the revised edition. Many other misprints in the Chongqing edition of the junior high school history textbook have been corrected in the Shanghai edition, and there are major corrections in the revised edition. It is hoped that schools will pay attention to purchasing the revised edition, which is the most appropriate!</p>

<h3>Decision to Halt Tea Purchase, Tea Merchants Allowed to Add Additional Collateral, Total Tea Loan Amount for This Year Already Approved by the Four Banks Joint Office</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance announced that the national treasury had no budget for the profits and losses of tea purchases and could not bear the burden, the national banks' discussions on bundling loans and export methods have become ineffective. After exchanging views with representatives from the tea merchants to the customs banks and the Agricultural Bank of China, a new decision was finally reached last night: the government has decided to cancel the purchases. In the future, tea merchants will work hard to manage exports and accelerate new tea production. The national banks have allowed tea merchants to add additional collateral to facilitate turnover. The amount is standardized at 80% of the originally scheduled collateral price for new tea this year, i.e., 480,000 yuan for Qihong (originally 350,000 yuan), 400,000 yuan for Tunlv (originally 280,000 yuan), and 320,000 yuan for Pinglv (originally 200,000 yuan). The total amount of additional collateral is worth several billion yuan. This will revitalize the rural economy. It is also reported that the above measures will be implemented after being submitted to the Four Banks Joint Office for approval.</p>
<p>Also, at the 320th meeting held by the Four Banks Joint Office, the tea loan program for this year was approved. The loan areas are the provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, and Hubei, which is more widespread than last year. The total amount is 80 billion yuan, which is nearly ten times more than last spring. Loans are based on processing as the focal point, followed by transportation, sales, and collateral in export locations. The aim is to attract idle funds into rural areas, devote efforts to production, and promote the production of packaged, refined tea for transportation, sales, and export to earn foreign exchange. According to last year's packaged tea situation, although companies such as Wang Yutai, Huacha, Jiuxing, Xinghua, Dadechang, Zhenzhong, and Zhongnan exported through land routes, a large amount still remains in Shanghai. The loans have been in place for almost a year, and due to delays in manufacturing and transportation, sluggish exports, and the operation of production funds, they are not flexible enough. It is hoped that this year's tea loans will be completed within five months to promote the development of the tea industry.</p>
<p>The tea loan program for this year has been approved by the Four Banks Joint Office, and its purpose is to support tea merchants' exports, earn foreign exchange, and balance international payments. Therefore, the amount has increased tenfold compared to last year, and tea-producing areas such as Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are all handled in the same way, in order to be widespread. Tea merchants can obtain loans in all processes, from processing to transportation, sales, and export. The loan for the processing period is deducted when handling sales loans, and the loan for the transportation and sales stage is deducted when exporting. This allows the loan to have a cyclical effect. Therefore, the tea loan is divided into three stages and processed separately. The first step is the processing loan, totaling over 27 billion; the second step is the transportation and sales loan, totaling over 50 billion; and the third step is the export loan, totaling over 80 billion. All of these are determined based on the actual needs of the tea merchants. Based on an average of 400,000 yuan per dan, it is estimated that 250,000 dan of tea can be exported this year (excluding tea merchants' own funds). In order to reduce leaf costs and save expenses, the bank has stipulated that each tea factory must have a minimum annual output of 100 dan in order to qualify for a processing loan. Those who do not meet 100 dan can form a cooperative tea factory with several other tea factories to reach the 100 dan figure. Otherwise, approval is unlikely. Processing loans can be processed starting in mid-month. Cooperative tea factories can apply later once the organization is ready.</p>

<h3>Government Bonds Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Government bonds were sold off by a major player, Chen, in yesterday's morning session, leading to weakness. However, new players were still active, and the price easily rebounded after the weakness. Unified C bonds opened at 11,500 yuan, immediately falling to 10,500 yuan, struggling between 11,000 yuan and 12,000 yuan.

<h3>Grain Stores Take Delivery, Xian Rice Sales Are Good</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the North and South markets received a total of over 12,500 shi of rice. After a long period of weakness, the stores have skillfully taken delivery, and middle- and low-grade early thin rice has shown some activity. The trend for northern japonica rice has also become firm. Xian rice sales are good, while Baiyuan and Yinyuan have seen little change. The supply and demand for flour remains fairly balanced, with little change for the time being. However, foreign flour is being digested actively, and prices have continued to rise by 1,000 yuan. Bran sales are very sluggish, with a flat trend. Bean cake sales to the customer groups are normal, but the factory side is quite firm on selling prices due to expensive raw materials, and prices have risen slightly by 100-200 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of soybeans remains scarce, but the demand is acceptable. The price is nominally stable but secretly tight, rising by 1,000 yuan. Green beans are similar. Southern red beans continue to be handled, and arrivals cannot keep up with sales, rising by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Corn is being taken by alcohol factories, rising by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Red sorghum is strong, and foreign firms are slightly interested in raw peanuts, creating a stable situation. Sesame remains solid, and broad beans are outstanding. Although the sales of oil to foreign locations are unchanged, sporadic real sales are still active on the street, and arrivals remain scarce. Raw oil continues to rise by 2,000-3,000 yuan, sesame oil rises by 3,000-5,000 yuan, and clear oil and soybean oil continue to rise sharply by 10,000 yuan. At the close of the noon session, the prices were slightly flat.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau's allocation of artificial silk to the silk weaving industry this week has not been allocated as of yesterday. Also, the allocation of goods to the silk weaving joint venture company has not been delivered as scheduled. Therefore, the artificial silk market has risen sharply. Yesterday morning, Gaoshan No. 120 rose from 6.15 million yuan to a high of 6.25 million yuan. In the afternoon, the asking price rose further to 6.6 million yuan, but there were few sellers. On average, the price rose by 450,000 yuan compared to yesterday.</p>
<h3>17 Jintianbao and Other Large Silver Shops Reopen, More Redeemed Than Purchased</h3>
<p>After more than 200 small silver shops in the city reopened on the 29th of last month, 17 large silver shops, including Jintianbao, also reopened yesterday as a whole. The purchase price is 480,000 yuan per tael, according to the regulations of the Central Bank, and will increase or decrease according to the Central Bank's purchase price. The redemption price is 570,000 yuan per tael, of which 48,000 yuan is legal profit and 42,000 yuan is loss interest tax. Ordinary gold labor costs 2,000-3,000 yuan per qian, and a loss of 30,000 yuan must be paid to exchange old gold jewelry for new gold jewelry. Yesterday was the first day of reopening, and business was light, different from the past. Moreover, redemption was several times higher than purchase, so it is impossible to maintain for a long time. It is reported that the industry will request the government to allocate gold to maintain its business.</p>

<h3>Simplification of Cash Collection and Delivery Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Silver Industry Association and the Money Industry Association held a joint meeting at No. 59 Hong Kong Road to discuss simplifying cash collection and delivery methods. The collection and delivery of exchange differences between various banks and firms is centrally handled by the Central Bank. The amount of cash collected and delivered is very large, often extending to late at night, especially the transfer of large amounts of cash, which is very risky. It is not always possible to count the money at the time, and there are many disputes afterwards due to shortages, which the various banks and firms feel very painful. Therefore, the Central Bank was requested that all cash to be delivered by various banks and firms should be deposited in advance with the silver industry reserve association for safekeeping, and the reserve association should issue a custody certificate. The custody certificate can be accepted by the same industry and can be delivered to the Central Bank, in order to be safe and avoid the trouble of sending cash. In consideration of the difficulties of the various banks and firms, the Central Bank has agreed to accept this method. At the same time, if the various banks and firms encounter cash that should be received from the Central Bank, the Central Bank intends to issue a deposit slip to the bank and firm, in order to mutually facilitate business. The custody rules were discussed and approved yesterday, and will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and record, in order to be solemn.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Sales Remain Strong, Prices Steadily Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw continued purchases from the Tianjin group for Yuan Bi Ji, and there was also demand from Dihua. 客帮 (Ke Bang, meaning merchant groups from other provinces) absorbed a significant amount, leading to a steady increase in asking prices. Four Gentlemen Golden Seal Bi Ji rose from 160,000 yuan to a final price of 165,000 yuan. Initially, the market for plain gray cloth was stable, but towards the close of trading, it was reported that yarn prices were still rising. Local Liang factories and retail shops replenished their stocks, boosting confidence. Asking prices for various types of plain cloth uniformly increased compared to the previous day, ranging from 1,000 to 5,600 yuan. Twelve-pound Dragon Head plain cloth was priced at 157,500 yuan, Blue Chicken at 150,000 yuan, and Five Blessings at 153,000 yuan. Yesterday, Fangjian Company continued to supply cloth as usual, with Five Blessings gray cloth listed at 148,500 yuan. Traders in the industry were actively buying up purchase orders from the company at higher prices. The prices of other bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and natural-colored cloth also remained firm. However, the retail sales of blue cloth and Shilin cloth were sluggish, and the market remained weak and lifeless.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Canceled by Designated Banks Must Be Sold Separately to the National Bank</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Bank yesterday issued Circular No. 92 to all designated banks, stating: If a designated bank, according to the regulations of the Central Bank or other reasons, cancels foreign exchange that it has sold to its customers, such as when the letter of credit has expired and there is still an unused balance, then the canceled foreign exchange should be resold to the Central Bank according to the following regulations: (1) If the letter of credit for the canceled foreign exchange was established between March 4, 1946, and August 16, 1946, it must be sold to the National Bank at a rate of 3,340 yuan per US dollar and 13,450 yuan per British pound. Other currencies can be converted at the above US dollar or British pound rates. However, the designated bank needs to convert these currencies into US dollars or British pounds for delivery to the Central Bank, and the Central Bank can choose either one. (2) If the letter of credit for the canceled foreign exchange was established after August 19, 1946, it must be resold to the National Bank at the National Bank's quoted buying price on the date the designated bank sold the foreign exchange to its customers. Other currencies not quoted by the Central Bank can be converted at the National Bank's quoted buying price for US dollars or British pounds on that day. The designated bank needs to convert these currencies into US dollars or British pounds for delivery to the Central Bank, and the Central Bank can choose either one.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Section 6 of Circular No. 54 issued by the National Bank on September 23, 1946, is hereby canceled.</p>
<h3>Joint Allocation Office Lacks Control, Edible Oil Market Prices Rise Frequently, Social Affairs Bureau to Convene Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation with edible oil continued to be one of rising prices. Off-market transactions saw peanut oil at 230,000 yuan per担 (dan, a unit of weight) for a Jeep barrel, and soybean oil at 285,000 yuan. The Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office has not allocated any oil since the beginning of last week. The Social Affairs Bureau is paying close attention to this matter. Yesterday, it also received an order from the highest authorities, stating: "The price of edible oil in Shanghai has been rising continuously in recent days, which greatly affects the lives of citizens. It has been learned that the main reason for the rise, in addition to insufficient supply, is that the Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office lacks control and cannot shirk its responsibility..." After receiving the order, the Social Affairs Bureau decided to convene a meeting at 3:00 PM tomorrow with the responsible persons from the China Vegetable Oil Factory, the China Edible Oil Company, the Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office, the Industrial Association of the Third District Refining Industry, and the Shanghai Oil Industry Commercial Association to discuss strengthening the function of the Edible Oil Joint Allocation Office and urging the improvement of joint allocation methods. It is also reported that the problem of oil allocation in this city has come to a standstill because private oil mills are unwilling to supply oil. The relevant departments of the Social Affairs Bureau believe that, according to the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, any factory that has inventory and refuses to supply civilian needs may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years and a fine of one to three times the value of the goods. To allow private manufacturers to express their opinions and seek a fair and reasonable solution, it was decided to convene a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau on the afternoon of the 3rd with the responsible persons from the oil pressing industry, the oil trade, and the joint allocation office to discuss everything.</p>
<h3>China Farmers Bank Holds 14th Anniversary Celebration, New Assistant Managers Cheng Yuanfan and Others Take Office Simultaneously</h3>
<p>The China Farmers Bank held its 14th anniversary ceremony at 10:00 AM on April 1st at its head office on Zhonghua Road in Nanjing. The newly appointed Assistant Managers Cheng Yuanfan, Xue Dijin, and Zhao Baoquan were also announced to take office simultaneously. Chairman Chen Guofu delivered a speech, first praising the past achievements and the efforts of colleagues over the past 14 years, which have led to today's achievements. The Farmers Bank will have even greater responsibilities in the future, and he hopes that colleagues will make extra efforts to promote the increase in agricultural production in our country. We should continue to release the various loans that have been approved, and the amount released should exceed the budgeted amount to invigorate rural finance and restore prosperity. This year, the Farmers Bank will advance with the development of national economic construction. Finally, he said: During today's celebration ceremony, the newly appointed Assistant Managers Cheng, Xue, and Zhao were announced to take office simultaneously. Chen also introduced the experiences of each of them and encouraged colleagues to work harder in the future, each guarding their posts, conducting more research and promotion in their work, and progressing with the progress of the bank's business. Subsequently, Directors Zhao Zhiyao, Li Zikuan, Liu Yongyao, and General Manager Li Shuming delivered speeches successively, and Qian Tianhe, Chairman of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Di Ying, a member of the Central Committee, were invited to speak. Di congratulated them on the abundance of talents and resources. The meeting adjourned around 12:00 noon. The past history of the Farmers Bank is described as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Evolution: The predecessor of the bank was the Farmers Bank of the four provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi. At that time, the National Army was suppressing the Communists in the Jiangxi area, and in view of the desolation of the rural areas, the bank was established in the 22nd year of the Republic to benefit the rural economy. The head office was set up in Hankou. After the government implemented the legal tender policy, the bank was listed as a national bank issuing legal tender. Therefore, in the 24th year of the Republic, it was renamed the China Farmers Bank, expanded its scope, and moved its head office to Shanghai. Less than two years later, the War of Resistance broke out, and the head office was moved to Chongqing. After the victory, it began to recover and moved to the capital.</p>
<p>2.  Distribution of Institutions: Before the war, the institutions established in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang were relatively widespread. During the war, new institutions were actively established in South China and the provinces of Sichuan, Kang, Guizhou, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu. However, in several provinces in North China, preparations began after the recovery. In total, including county cooperative treasuries, agricultural loan correspondence offices, and agricultural warehouses and other branches, there are more than 750 units (of which branch units are more than 280), with more than 4,680 employees.</p>
<p>3.  Business Conditions: (1) Increase rural production to cooperate with the government's export policy is the goal. The current business center is divided into four points: (A) Agricultural loans, (B) Land finance (handling agricultural land improvement, loans, and agricultural land distribution loans), (C) General banking business, (D) Handing matters (establishing the Pacification Zone Business Promotion Committee, handling Pacification small wood loans). Among the above four items, agricultural loans are the main focus. This type of loan is divided into two types: ordinary and special. Ordinary loans include living, processing, improved seeds, working cattle, marketing, and side businesses. Special loans are for tea, silk, etc. A total of more than 10 million yuan have been loaned for various loans.</p>
<h3>US Treasury Bills and Bonds, Subscription Voucher Format Has Been Determined</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Central Bank received an order from the Ministry of Finance the night before yesterday to start handling the issuance of US Treasury bills and bonds. The format of the US Treasury bills and bonds subscription vouchers was also determined by the bank around 5:00 PM yesterday, with one type each for treasury bills and bonds. The text on it roughly stated: "Received from ××× National Currency ×××, converted according to the Central Bank's US dollar exchange rate of ×××, totaling US$××× face value of 36-year short-term treasury bills, with interest coupons attached from the ×th period. After the bonds are printed, this voucher will be used for exchange. This subscription voucher is specially issued as proof." There are two notes printed next to the voucher: (1) This subscription voucher will be void if altered. (2) This subscription voucher is divided into registered and unregistered types. However, if the unregistered type is lost or destroyed, it cannot be reported as lost. The subscription voucher is in triplicate, one for the bond purchaser, one for the report, and one for the stub. The Central Bank delivered it to the Sixth Joint Printing Plant for printing around 6:00 PM yesterday, with 5,000 copies of each type printed first. It is expected to be completed within a few days.</p>
<p>The organization of the sales committee will be established according to the situation in various places, with the number of members ranging from eleven to seventeen. The members of the municipal sales committee will be set at seventeen, and the list is currently being proposed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the silver and money industry, and other guilds. In addition to the Central Bank being responsible for the issuance of bonds, it will also promote the three banks and two bureaus, and other commercial banks and firms to jointly assist in the issuance. The list of banks and firms is also under consideration.</p>
<h3>Dried Longan Arrived Sparsely, Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival and inventory of dried longan are scarce, and the market is tight. The price of Tong'an goods has risen by nearly 20% before and after, and it is heard that Guangdong has also risen by 20-30% due to the lack of inventory. Given the price reversals with Shanghai, the future market will inevitably follow closely.</p>

<h3>Plain Carriages and White Horses Fill the Capital Gate, Public Burial for General Dai Yunong</h3>
<p>— Nanjing Express News, March 26th, Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua</p>
<p>Dai Li, Dai Yunong, no Chinese person does not know his heroic name. Quietness, patience, greatness, and strength are the main factors of his success. For twenty years, regardless of fame or gain, adhering to the spirit of "never yielding when it comes to righteousness, and acting bravely when seeing justice," he devoted himself to the revolution and dedicated himself to the country, creating his illustrious career. He is indeed a legendary figure in China.</p>
<p>"General Dai's underground work strengthened the anti-Japanese ranks; General Dai's Sino-American cooperation shortened the world war." These are the words of American friends who posthumously praised the late General Dai, and they are also iron facts.</p>
<p>Loyal Soul Lives Forever in Zhigong Temple</p>
<p>From June 14th last year, the loyal soul of the late Director Dai has been entrusted to Zhigong Temple. He is not lonely. Candles are always bright, and there are often attendants serving. He has been resting for ten months. Today (the 26th) is the grand ceremony for his relocation and public burial. Plain carriages and white horses filled the inside and outside, and the crowd was huge and unprecedented. The superiors, colleagues, subordinates, relatives, and friends who had been estranged for more than a year met today, and the General smiled! The General's thick eyebrows and sharp eyes were a display of heroic spirit, inspiring respect. The layout of the mourning hall was simple, with incense swirling around. The portrait of the late Director Dai, surrounded by white floral tributes, was placed in the center of the mourning hall. Above hung Chairman Chiang's eulogy "Loyalty for a Thousand Autumns," and on both sides of the temple door were General Hu Zongnan's couplet: "The ancestral sorrow of the rooster's crow, the vast Yellow River, who else will bravely strike to cross the river? The spring breeze blows across the wild grass, the turbulent world, only you are enough to fear the rebellious ministers." Further inside was the couplet by the head of the funeral committee, General Zhu Shaoliang: "Crossing the sea to help slay the long whale, generously seeking revenge, happily paying this aspiration in Jiuyao, with the fierce omen of the wind retreating the crane, calmly sacrificing oneself, winning a monument of loyalty for thousands of years." After twelve o'clock, central leaders and all sectors of the capital went to pay their respects. Liang Hancao, Gui Yongqing, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Guofu, Chen Bulei, Zhu Shuming, Yang Hu, Du Yuesheng... all came to mourn. The sky was filled with gloomy clouds, and the candlelight flickered in front of the spirit. Dai's son, Zhuangyi, tearfully answered the condolences, and the mourning hall was filled with a tragic scene.</p>
<p>Foreign Brothers Weep Bitterly Before the Spirit</p>
<p>Major General Miles and General Dai Yunong were the leading figures in charge of Sino-American cooperation. Since the 31st year of the Republic, he and General Dai had planned how to defeat the enemy and how to support the Allied forces' landing. For five years, they had risen and fallen together, secretly entered enemy territory, disguised themselves and stood up along the coast, directed and attacked in combat, and pre-organized the training of students. He had personally experienced some dangers. Once, when inspecting the southeast, he was almost shot down by enemy planes. Therefore, they were not only good friends at work, but also foreign brothers in times of trouble. Analyzing the enemy's situation, they were in perfect harmony. When they drank, they would toast and drain their glasses. Their feelings were extremely harmonious. The fruitful achievements of Sino-American cooperation were, of course, the harvest of their private friendship. Unfortunately, General Dai died for his country. Miles recalled his comings and goings to Zhongjiashan in Chongqing and wept uncontrollably. He came from the United States specifically to pay his respects. Today, he was wearing a gray and light black suit. After getting out of the car, he heard the mourning music and felt depressed and sad. Walking up the stone steps and entering the mourning hall, he couldn't help but shed tears. He stood to pay his respects, expressing his grief to the extreme. Then he went inside to view the coffin and shook hands with Dai's son, Zhuangyi, with a furrowed brow. Dai's son was moved by the people and cried loudly. Miles also shed tears like pearls. Other accompanying mourners also wept, and the scene was indescribably tragic. After the Major General entered the rest room, his tears continued for more than ten minutes. When our reporters asked about the past of Sino-American cooperation, he was too sad to speak. He only said, "General Dai is my Chinese brother. The word 'sincere' is enough to be praised. My emotions are really too impulsive to say more, please forgive me!" Before the translator had finished translating, he was filled with tears again, flowing down like rain.</p>
<p>Chairman Personally Presides Over the Funeral</p>
<p>At one o'clock in the afternoon, Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Qun walked into the mourning hall together. Both of them and the late General Dai were close friends who participated in the central government during the War of Resistance, discussing major military and national policies. Today, they caught a glimpse of Dai's remains and couldn't help but feel extremely sad! When the two entered the rest room, suddenly a bugle call of attention came from afar. At this time, the personnel in charge of security were vigilant for a while, knowing that the head of state had come to Zhigong Temple in person. In the midst of the mournful military music, Chairman Chiang arrived at 1:15 PM. Party and state elders President Yu Youren and Secretary General Shao Lizi and his wife also arrived at this time and were listed as mourners along with Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, and Zheng Jiemin. The chairman bowed his head in silence, with a sad expression on his face, and used a glove to wipe away his tears. He offered incense, flowers, and read the eulogy, every word was tears, every sentence was heartbreaking! When reading to "The school collapsed and the beam broke, the worry of the party and the country, the loss of the limbs, the transfer of assistants is impossible, the tears cannot be collected after a year of absence? Remotely watching the great opportunity, my heart is leisurely!" he couldn't help but shed tears. For a moment, there was silence, and the mountains and rivers lost their color.</p>
<p>General Sleeps Forever, Leaving a Thousand Years of Regret</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the relocation and public burial began. Suddenly, the sound of firecrackers shook the mountains. The relocation team's guards slowly advanced through the dense forest. The vanguard was the music team, followed by the guests holding the ropes, and then the coffin covered with the party flag. Dai's subordinates guarded the spirit from left to right, front and rear, and the filial sons and grandsons were at the rear. After twenty minutes, they arrived at the cemetery. Standing in front and looking straight, they saw the tombstone of General Dai Yunong, erected on March 26, 36th year of the Republic of China, written by Wu Zhizhi himself, which made people look up to him. The cemetery faces west from the east, backed by Zijin Mountain, about a mile away from the cemetery of the martyrs of the National Revolutionary Army, reflecting and shining on each other. The tomb was built of three-in-one cement, one zhang long, five chi wide, and five chi deep, with a national flag at the bottom to show the meaning of a public burial. The coffin was moved into the tomb by Dai's senior subordinates and students themselves. At 2:25 PM, the burial was officially held. Major General Miles mourned for a long time. At this time, he shed many heroic tears again! Just as the farewell ceremony was being held, Minister Chen Lifu, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, and Chairman Fang Zhi also arrived at this time to participate in the ceremony. At that time, there was no sound. Forever grieving for the misfortune of the Chinese people and the misfortune of the world!</p>
<p>Looking at the General's Merits from Numbers</p>
<p>The late Director Dai was responsible for military intelligence work for twenty years and made great contributions to the Republic of China. Let's look at his merits from the statistics! During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he presided over the Military Affairs Committee Investigation and Statistics Bureau, destroying the enemy 2,107 times, attacking 585 times, sanctioning 515 enemy leaders, killing 17,873 enemy personnel, wounding 4,916 people, capturing 566 people, destroying 492 enemy locomotives, 1,627 carriages, 477 cars, 20,320 boxes of gasoline, 1,797 motors, 2,675 meters of electric weaving, 15 machines, 442 ships, 51 fortresses and bunkers, 2,1318 rifles, 33 cannons, 48,209 boxes of various ammunition, 71 aircraft, 1,578 barracks, 81,462 ancestral grains, 1,316 telephone poles, 5,551 military uniforms and blankets, 5,051 boxes of toxic gas raw materials, 250 bridges, 1,658 meters of rails, 19,924 zhang of iron wire, 547 boxes of kerosene, 56,415 pieces of silk cloth, 7,670 bales of cotton, and seized a lot of spoils.</p>
<p>Taking Sino-American cooperation alone, in the past three years, 26,799 enemies have been killed, 11,642 have been wounded, 508 have been captured, 182 bridges have been destroyed, 158 sampans have been destroyed, 35 steamships have been destroyed, one aircraft has been destroyed, 425 locomotives and carriages have been destroyed, 271 warehouses have been destroyed, 303 sections of railways have been destroyed, 269 motorized vehicles have been destroyed, and 130 United Nations pilots have been rescued. These achievements are the price of the struggle and sacrifice of General Dai and his hundreds of thousands of subordinates, and his reputation will be immortal.</p>
<p>Visiting Miles After Returning from the Cemetery</p>
<p>Returning from the cemetery, I felt that it was a regret not to have received Miles's final assessment of General Dai. So I drove to Miles's residence to inquire. At this time, Major General Miles was calm. The reporter first asked what he thought of General Dai. Miles happily gestured and said, "General Dai is good, General Dai is good!" Then he spoke to the reporter non-stop: "My first impression of General Dai is that he is decisive and capable. When I first arrived in Chongqing and met General Dai, it was the most critical time in the Chinese war. I asked him if there was a way to deploy along the coast. He replied to me: "There is a way. I am absolutely responsible. In two months, you will see my realistic performance!" At that time, I was busy investigating personnel and had no chance to find him. One day, he suddenly came to find me. I was very happy and said, "Mr. Miles, look at this stack of telegrams. This is from Fuzhou. This is from Wenzhou. This is from Shantou, this is from Guangzhou. How the enemy is eroding, the positions adopted by the enemy, as well as the internal organization and financial situation of the enemy, are all pointed out to me one by one. I was very surprised, and I pressed him closely. What's going on. He said that a week ago, I personally went to those places to arrange it. I limited them to immediately show results. I told you a month ago that there was a way, and I am absolutely responsible, that's the reason. From here on, I deeply recognized General Dai, so I immediately sent a telegram to Washington, and in less than half a month, Washington approved my plan to cooperate with General Dai, and the work of the later Sino-American Cooperation Institute was produced. My second impression of General Dai is that he is responsible in his work. General Dai often said to me: My methods are only eight words, which are "hard work, hard guarding, taking responsibility, and accepting complaints." The achievements of Dai's life lie in this place. His subordinates are happy to obey orders and also achieve "quietness, patience, greatness, and firmness," loyal to the country and loyal to the leader. General Dai is responsible in his work, and I will use a fact to illustrate: After the recovery of the Philippines, the US military prepared to land from China, and the authorities gave me information asking me to cooperate with the Chinese side to support the landing. After all the arrangements were made, Chiang Kai-shek was deeply worried that after some people retreated, the bandits would take the opportunity to cause chaos. At this time, General Dai often flew on the southeast line to make arrangements. One day, he said to Chairman Chiang: "The leader can rest assured that as long as the Japanese army retreats, it must be our loyal National Salvation Army who will be the first to raise the banner in Nanjing and Shanghai to respond to the National Army. Not only will the bandits not be able to enter, but we must also seize Nanjing and Shanghai before the Allied forces." Later, it was all realized. This is what subordinates say to their superiors about being responsible. My third impression of General Dai is that he loves his soldiers and his comrades. He often threatened his subordinates that the soldiers and officers of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau are all comrades, and there is only a difference in duties. I often go up and down the mountains with General Dai. General Dai always asked about the soldiers' living conditions along the way, and if there were any malpractices, he would go back and punish them, so the general soldiers regarded General Dai as their parents and were able to use them peacefully, which proves General Dai's kind and equal virtue. ... Major General was busy answering the phone that had been ringing! After the reporter got this valuable information, he said goodbye and left. Major General replied politely with the words "farewell for now."</p>
<p>General Dai, born to be a hero, died to be a spirit, come back again! The Republic of China needs you!</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Overseas Chinese Merchants Flock to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Hải Phòng, 15th Day of the Voyage — Zhu Jin</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Hải Phòng, the Gateway to Vietnam</p>
<p>Currently, it is estimated that there are approximately 400,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam. Broken down by gender, males constitute 80%, and females 20%. By occupation, the majority are laborers, followed by businessmen, and then freelance professionals. The most populous residential area is Xī Dī in Southern Vietnam, followed by Hải Phòng, Hà Nội, and Nam Định in Northern Vietnam, and then Huế and Quy Nhơn in Central Vietnam. By place of origin, Guangdong is the most represented, followed by Fujian, with very few from other provinces.</p>
<p>Hải Phòng is one of the gateways to Vietnam. Academic groups such as the "Đông An," "Overseas English," "Shí Xí," and "Zhonghua" alumni associations have been established. Recently, the Overseas Chinese Alumni Association and the Zhonghua National Federation have also been established. Luo Weiqi, the chairman of the Zhonghua Association, and Chunli, the chairman of the Zhonghua Chamber of Commerce, are both veteran overseas Chinese leaders in the city.</p>
<p>The former Consul in Hải Phòng, Zhu Yuanzhang, has been recalled to Beijing. During the interim, Xie Wushen from the Consulate General in Hà Nội is responsible for the duties. The newly appointed Consul in Hải Phòng, Xiao Jinfang, has arrived in Hải Phòng and will formally assume office soon. Xiao is against the recent French proposal to reinstate the former Bangzhang system, believing that the establishment of such a system is a clear attempt to divide the strength of the Chinese. If the French side insists on restoring this Bang system, he will decide to take effective countermeasures. He attaches great importance to overseas Chinese education in the city (Hải Phòng). Mr. Xiao has been quite busy inspecting various places in recent days.</p>
<p>Order Restored in Hà Nội City</p>
<p>Hà Nội is the political, economic, cultural, and transportation center of Northern Vietnam. The US Consulate General is located there. Currently, Colonel Ba, the supreme commander of the French army (referring to Northern Vietnam), is commanding the French army in battle with the Việt Minh forces.</p>
<p>Order has been restored in Hà Nội city, but commerce has come to a standstill. There is no large-scale publishing industry here; spiritual nourishment can only rely on supplies from Hong Kong, Saigon, and Kunming. The cultural level of the overseas Chinese is relatively low, and they do not have much interest in films from the motherland.</p>
<p>Frequent Robberies in the "Three-No Zone"</p>
<p>Móng Cái is located on the Sino-Vietnamese border. The area is small, and most of the residents are Chinese. It faces the town of Dongxing in Fangcheng County, Guangdong Province, across the river. Geographically, this border area has little value, but due to the past resistance wars, this small border area has become the only route for movement from Southern Guangdong to Vietnam, and everything has flourished. The population of Móng Cái is only about ten thousand, and the city appearance is quite clean. However, the security there has been poor recently. Robberies occur frequently at night, causing considerable alarm to the citizens. The French forces have not yet arrived, the Vietnamese forces are insufficient, and the Chinese government does not care, so it has become a "three-no zone." Bandits appear and disappear unpredictably.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Business District Inspections</p>
<p>(1) Northern Vietnam: Hải Phòng, Hà Nội, Hưng Yên Port, Macau, Beihai, and Zhan City (Guangzhou Bay) have convenient water transportation. Most of the overseas Chinese here engage in export business, with rice, coal, iron, and various local products being the main commodities.</p>
<p>(2) Central Vietnam: Huế, Đà Nẵng Port, Hội An, Thanh Hóa, Nghệ An, Quảng Trị, Quảng Ngãi, etc., mostly deal in medicinal materials, followed by foreign sundries and local products, and then food products.</p>
<p>(3) Southern Vietnam: Saigon-Cholon, abbreviated as "Xī Dī," has a larger commercial port, a larger population, and complex business sectors. The main businesses are ships, rice, sugar, raw rubber, timber, and firewood. Foreign sundries have a wider market, and various side businesses are also quite prosperous.</p>
<p>(4) Cambodia and Laos: Mostly engaged in cultivating pepper, kapok, and corn. The market mainly trades in medicinal materials and foreign goods.</p>
<p>In Northern Vietnam, since the French announced the regulations for controlling import and export trade and foreign exchange settlement last year, import and export trade has almost come to a standstill, and the overseas Chinese economy has been severely hit. Since the outbreak of the French-Vietnamese war, the situation has been even worse, and most merchants have moved to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>New Education, New Youth, New China</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jixi</p>
<p>Youth are the new cells of the country and the new bloodline of the nation. Therefore, the construction of a new country, the growth of a new nation, or the innovation of an ancient country, and the revival of a declining nation, all depend on outstanding youth who are healthy, virtuous, highly intelligent, capable, ambitious, promising, and principled. But to have such new youth, there must be a perfect new education. To build a prosperous and happy new China, we must educate healthy, virtuous, and intelligent new youth, and develop a perfect new education.</p>
<p>We have been running new education for decades, but it has all been copied and imitated, repeating what others say, without taking the best and discarding the worst, or innovating. Instead, we have cultivated countless traitors, national thieves, corrupt officials, unscrupulous clerks, profiteers, local bullies, and evil gentry… so the more new education we run, the more chaotic and impoverished the country and society become! Therefore, to cultivate talents and build the country, and to save the country and the people, we must have a new national construction education movement, to run our education of new youth, and to build a new China with a change of direction and a new life education.</p>
<p>The most important thing in educating new youth and building a new China's new education is to cultivate noble personalities in the youth. Last July 11th, the author flew from Chongqing to Beijing to return to the capital in victory. Because of the deep feeling of the low level of personality, physique, and qualifications of the general people, as well as the declining academic, political, family, social, and national customs, which are a major obstacle to the future of national construction, I published an article "Advocating Three Qualities and Rectifying Five Customs" in "Ta Kung Pao" to correct people's hearts and change customs. Eight months later, the three qualities and five customs have become even worse, leading to more chaos and poverty in the country and society, and the general ignorant masses are even more miserable. If this continues, the future of the country and nation is truly unthinkable! To save the country and the people and build a new China, we must respect personality and rectify declining customs; to rectify declining customs and respect personality, we must first rectify academic customs and cultivate noble personalities in the youth; to rectify academic customs and cultivate noble personalities in the youth, we must first invite morally esteemed and highly respected scholars to be university and middle school principals and heads of training (deans of universities, directors of moral education in middle schools), so that they can lead by example and be teachers for the youth, implementing personality edification and personality education. If there is no noble personality or moral prestige, then even if one is highly talented and knowledgeable, they are not worthy to be university principals or heads of training. As for the cultivation of good academic customs and the shaping of youth personality, as far as the author can see, it seems that the four words "loyalty, trustworthiness, diligence, and frugality" should be the goal. The meaning of "loyalty," I think, is "responsibility." In this great era of national construction, the most important thing for the new youth of China is to be loyal to the country and loyal to the people, that is, to be responsible to the country and the people. Everyone must establish the great ambition of building the country and saving the people, and take on the great responsibility of building the country and saving the people, to save the people from deep waters and raging fires, and to make the country a prosperous and happy city as their own responsibility. Secondly, they must be loyal to their duties. Although young students have not yet served society and the country, their study at school is originally for learning for application, for serving the country and society. Therefore, they must have sufficient preparation and in-depth research for the duties they intend to take up in the future, so that when they graduate and are employed, they can display their strengths, stand on their own positions, and make the best efforts and the greatest contributions to a certain sector of national and social construction. Other things such as the training of service ethics and the cultivation of enduring hard work are all personality education for training young people to be courageous in taking responsibility and loyal to their duties. Secondly, the meaning of "trustworthiness," from the "shape" of the word, is "human words are trustworthy." Therefore, new youths who have received new education must think what they say, and do what they say; thinking, saying, doing, or heart, words, actions, must be like the three points said in geometry, connecting the three to form a straight line, which is heart straight, mouth straight, consistent words and actions, which is trustworthiness. Conversely, if you connect the three points to form an angle, it is curved and not straight, action does not follow words, words are insincere, and untrustworthy. Therefore, new youths who have received new education, whether learning, being a person, doing things, dealing with people, or conducting themselves in the world… must respond to each other with sound and heart, consistent words and actions, that is, heart, words, and actions are one, to become a person of integrity and outstanding integrity. Thirdly, the meaning of "diligence" is to do one's best without being lazy or tired. Young students, if they can study diligently and persevere, they will surely, because of their nature, their talents, their interests, and their abilities, continue to improve and succeed, and even become great scientists, great inventors, and great scholars, all in the word "move." We, the new youths who have received new education to build a new China, can we not "persuade" to seek knowledge and develop the virtue of diligence to seek to establish achievements? Fourthly, the meaning of "frugality" is to be thrifty and not to waste. Today, the young people who are educated in middle schools and universities, the rich often squander extravagantly, indulging in luxury, wasting the country and society's wealth, and wasting precious youthful time. How regrettable this is! Moreover, they often wear foreign clothes, eat Western food, and use foreign goods, which is all the more distressing! To promote domestic goods and advocate a frugal construction of the country, we must start with young students. Young students must not only save money and materials, but also save time, because they are still in the consumption era of studying, and consumers who waste and students who study to play are truly moths of the country and society, and their future will be unthinkable! Therefore, all young students in the country must develop the virtue of thrift. Only if new education can shape the new youth's noble personality and virtues of loyalty to love the country, trustworthiness to be a person, diligence to study, and frugality to nourish the factory with the above four, can it create new talents for building a new China. It is hoped that comrades across the country who are engaged in new education and training new youth will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Secondly, the new education of educating new youth and building a new China must train young people in scientific knowledge and construction technology. In the past, China's school science education can be said to be divorced from the needs of national construction and people's livelihood, so on the one hand, various construction departments of the country and society need talents but cannot find them, and on the other hand, countless young people need work but cannot find it. There are many reasons for this contradictory phenomenon, but the main reason is that the training in the past education was insufficient, so that when young people leave school, there are inevitable problems in their knowledge and ability, and what is presented to us is that all kinds of construction undertakings need talents, but countless young people cannot be employed. Learning from the past, the new education of training new youth in the future must actively train them in scientific knowledge and construction technology.</p>
<p>Science education in secondary schools must focus on experiments and compiling "China-based" textbooks, so that science speaks Chinese and studies Chinese science problems. However, in addition to clarifying basic scientific principles, experiments must focus on scientific knowledge and skills needed for people's daily life and various construction undertakings. The books, instruments, and all equipment needed for scientific experiments and research must be enriched as much as possible. As for compiling good China-based textbooks, attention should be paid to the following three points: (1) Recognizing the facts of our country's inventions in science in history and its contributions to strengthen the national self-confidence of young people in developing science; (2) Discussing the industrial, agricultural, and mining principles required for the construction of the new China and the types of talents and materials that the construction of the new China lacks to arouse the interest of young people in selecting specialized subjects in the future; (3) Trying to adopt and study the nature, uses, quantity, and manufacturing methods of native products, and how to improve them, can improve the quality and increase the output.</p>
<p>In higher education, the scientific research of young people should be matched with the needs of national construction and people's livelihood; that is, the scientific education of all colleges and universities above specialized subjects must aim at training cadres for national construction. Young students in colleges and universities above specialized subjects must be given more time and opportunities for practice and experiments. If they can use winter and summer vacations to send them to factories, farms, mines, hospitals, etc. for practice, so that they have a specialized scientific technology after graduation, they can devote themselves to construction work, it would be even better! When the author was in Chongqing a few years ago, I heard that the National Frontier School used winter and summer vacations to select students to go to various factories to learn a specialized technology, such as leather making, etc. I heard that the results were very good. This method is really a good way to train young people to learn scientific technology, and all schools can follow suit. As for larger universities with colleges of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine, they should establish research institutes related to construction undertakings, recruit talents, enrich equipment, enroll graduate students, and devote themselves to scientific research. Military scholars, if they want to study a scientific problem, should provide them with information at any time, and expect them to make inventions or creations? Young students with particularly excellent scientific achievements should be heavily rewarded to encourage them.</p>
<p>The world today is a world of science. To build a modern new China, we must actively develop scientific education and train young people in scientific knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>Furthermore, new education must train strong, brave, and enterprising new youth to move towards the future of building a new China and move forward.</p>
<p>Our China has always had the saying of "sick man of East Asia." Generally, young students are often weak and sick. According to the results of health checkups in various schools, more than 80% have physical defects. This is a major obstacle to the future of national construction. To build a prosperous and happy new China, we must train strong and brave new youth, so that young students who are prematurely old, weak, and sick can be transformed into strong and healthy, "powerful," and "brave and knowledgeable" "materials." To achieve this goal, schools at all levels must pay special attention to the health of young people. All equipment for medicine, hygiene, sports, etc. that can improve health must be enriched as much as possible. Special attention should be paid to the cleanliness of toilets, classrooms, dining halls, dormitories, and all school grounds, as well as environmental hygiene. Physical education classes must be widely promoted for fitness exercises. Morning exercises or inter-class exercises must be held every day, and extracurricular exercise time must be stipulated, forcing all young students to participate, and no absence is allowed without reason. When spring comes, students should be vaccinated to prevent smallpox. When summer comes, they should be injected with vaccines against cholera, typhoid, copper disease, etc. to prevent epidemics and ensure safety. In addition, such as pointing young students to have a fixed time for study, a fixed amount for diet, a regular life, and training them in hygienic habits, quitting all bad habits such as smoking and drinking, and actively promoting health education, are all new educational measures and activities to make young students strengthen their bodies, get rid of diseases, and improve their health.</p>
<p>In addition to training young people's strong bodies, new education must also train their brave and martial spirit, so that they have the courage to dare to act, the courage to do what is right, and the spirit of striving for sacrifice and striving for progress, and the perseverance to build achievements and establish a career without turning back.</p>
<p>New education is a great undertaking to train new youth, and new youth are the new force to build a new China. My respectable, admirable, and lovable comrades who are engaged in new education! We are all training officers who train the new force to build a new China. These thousands of new forces all rely on our noble personality to influence them; our extraordinary wisdom to teach them; our strong and majestic energy to train them, so that they can become new youth with noble personalities, extraordinary wisdom, strong and brave, healthy and intelligent, ambitious, promising, and principled, and build a prosperous and happy modern new China.</p>
<p>On the tenth of this month, after I published an article "The Road of National Construction Education" in "Ta Kung Pao," I was either interviewed or sent letters to discuss it. In the excitement, I drafted this article, and I hope that educational comrades and young friends will teach me. (Written in Shanghai, Nantong College on March 26, 1947)</p>

<h3>Appeal from Female Graduates of Silk School</h3>
<p>We are an unfortunate group who graduated from a female silk school. After graduation, we immediately suffered the pain of unemployment. The beautiful ideals we had in school have all become illusions. We dare not have other extravagant hopes, we only hope that society will give us an opportunity to be able to use what we have learned. So we waited for the opportunity to come. This year, the opportunity finally came. The Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Management Improvement Committee published the news of recruiting 500 instructors. We rushed to register, but the reply we received a month later was that we could not be hired due to lack of experience. This was like a bolt from the blue to us. How disappointed and heartbroken we felt!</p>
<p>May I ask: Do those who have experience have experience as soon as they leave school? Didn't they come from having no experience? If you must have experience to be hired, then why did the country establish silk schools? Wouldn't we, this group with no experience, be societal parasites forever! Is our life over? We want to question why the Sericulture Committee abandoned us, and we want to appeal and ask for the help and sympathy of people in society to save us (A group of female silk school graduates from Suzhou)</p>

<p>— Liang Lieya</p>
<p>Recently, I read a story about Sun Yat-sen in this newspaper's "Special Issue Commemorating the 22nd Anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's Death": "Sun Yat-sen was kind and rarely angry. When he lived in Shanghai, his servant, Chen Hè, was quite foolish. When things did not go his way, Sun Yat-sen would scold him: 'Dà Pào Hè,' but he rarely did so. 'Dà Pào' in Cantonese means foolish."</p>
<p>However, what I know is that Chen Hè was also a comrade, not Sun Yat-sen's servant. His position as Sun Yat-sen's cook was partly hired and partly voluntary. He was not a fool, just fond of gambling. Therefore, Mr. Feng Ziyou said in his book "Anecdotes of the Revolution": "One day, Zhang Taiyan, Tian Tong, Hu Hanmin, etc. were talking about the revolution at the Premier's residence (Tokyo, Japan, in 1906), and Deng Muhan, who was present, had no way to interject, so he entered the kitchen and talked about current affairs with the cook Chen Hè and the Japanese maid, enthusiastically, with voices that shook the outside. Chen Hè was also a comrade and liked to gamble. He often used the money for buying groceries for a gamble. Once, because he lost all his money gambling, he claimed that he lost his shoes in the cold alley and wanted the Premier to give him money to buy them again. (Cold alley is a Cantonese dialect, which is commonly known as the corridor. In Japanese architecture, the corridor is located indoors. According to Japanese customs, people sit on the floor, and shoes are placed outdoors.) There is no reason to lose shoes in the corridor. The kitchen speech and the cold alley shoe loss are both rare and strange events. The Premier once imitated the chapter titles of the chapter novels and made a couplet to give to Deng Muhan and Chen Hè: "Deng Shiye spoke in the accounting room; Chen Hèshu lost his shoes in the cold alley" to mock them." The party members in Tokyo also regarded this as an interesting and wonderful article, elegant and humorous, and recited it for a while. As for why the Premier did not use "Chen Zi" for "Deng Shiye," it was because he recognized Chen Hè as a revolutionary comrade, not as a cook. Furthermore, the Cantonese dialect also uses "Dà Pào" to mean exaggeration without substance, and even more so to mean exaggeration and shocking. "Dà Pào" is not entirely used to describe foolish people, but Chen Hè can indeed be called "Dà Pào Hè"!"</p>
<p>Also, during the time I followed the Premier, Zhu never saw the Premier scolding the employees he personally employed when they did not do their job well. Even if there were mistakes, he would only explain and instruct in detail. However, there were three comrades who were rebuked for errors in military affairs and for violating the party's principles. One, during the First World War, the Premier was about to take this opportunity to overthrow the traitorous Yuan government, and at the same time, he proposed to the British and French countries to abolish the unequal treaties against our country, and then make beneficial participation in the war. Wang Jingwei was always fond of making his own decisions and could not deeply understand the Premier's grand plan. He actually wrote a booklet "The Question of Participation in the War," intending to urge our country to quickly join the war, which was extremely disapproved by the Premier. One day, Wang met with the Premier and was rejected by the Premier, and he instructed Mr. Huang Huilong to tell Wang in a reprimanding tone: "Tell him (referring to Wang) not to come to see me, get out of here quickly!" Later, Wang destroyed all his books. Second, the troops under Mr. Liu Yushan failed to defend Boluo and retreated from Shilong to Shitan. At that time, the Premier's supervising car arrived, and Mr. Ye Xiasheng, Liu's chief of staff, met the Premier in the car. The Premier greatly rebuked the army for its poor performance! President Chiang, who was then the chief of the general staff, was also extremely angry when he followed on the side. He ordered the army to retake the lost ground within two hours, otherwise, they would be punished according to military law. Ye bravely rose up and led the regiment commander Tan Shouqiao back to the battle, and finally retook Shitan, and Guangzhou was stabilized. Third, in the thirteenth year, the Yunnan army stationed in Guangdong often occupied land and collected taxes, resisting government orders. At that time, people called them arrogant soldiers and generals. One day, Zhao Chengliang, the army division commander, entered the marshal's mansion to meet the Premier and called the Premier "Mister." The Premier was displeased and rebuked him: "You are not worthy to call me 'Mister'! (All of our party members call the Premier 'Mister' without adding a surname, just like Confucius's disciples call the Master.) You are a soldier wearing a military uniform and should respect this Grand Marshal as 'Grand Marshal.'" This is especially recorded together to make history.</p>
<h3>The First Letter</h3>
<p>— Lan Hui</p>
<p>A letter is a warmth, and I have received many warm letters of friendship; I feel that I am happy.</p>
<p>I once wanted to write a letter to someone I missed, but unfortunately, I was timid and lacked the courage, so the letter was never written; I just quietly sent him a meditation and blessing in the quiet of the long nights, or occasionally saw his shadow in my dreams, that unchanging shadow that remained in my memory; when I thought of that familiar shadow, I was filled with energy, and I secretly loved him, without letting anyone else know.</p>
<p>However, one day, I unexpectedly (and after a long time of secretly fantasizing), received his first letter, both surprised and delighted.</p>
<p>It was a gloomy afternoon, with fine rain drizzling all day, the soil moist and emitting a fresh scent. My fingers trembled as I held the letter, suppressing the excitement in my heart, forcing myself to guess which kind of hand had written the beautiful handwriting on the envelope; my memory clearly told me that it was his handwriting, but my heart was beating excessively with joy, a complex and contradictory feeling of hoping it was true but not daring to believe it, said that it was not his handwriting...</p>
<p>——If it's not his handwriting, whose handwriting is it then? …Strange, it looks so much like his handwriting! …I was bewildered, standing still, hesitating.</p>
<p>Finally, as if deciding my own fate, my panicked fingers quickly tore open the envelope, hastily and carefully pulling out the letter paper, fearing that I might damage the precious letter; my heart was pounding as I rushed to see the signature at the end of the letter first—it was him! It was his name! …I immediately stuffed the letter into my pocket, as if afraid it would "change" in an instant; then, as if I had stolen something and was afraid of being discovered, I hurried towards the distant fields. I had only one thought: to savor the words in the letter alone.</p>
<p>I disappeared into the green cornfield. The corn forest formed a small green world for me, and the rain brushed my cheeks, giving me a cool feeling. My heart was constantly thinking, busy and chaotic, and I didn't even know what I was thinking; I just felt my face burning for no reason…</p>
<p>Without missing a single one, my eyes searched for every word on the letter paper that would bring back my memories, and every kind word; I could not only understand all the meanings above, but even memorize the image of every word on it…</p>
<p>The sky above my head was still gloomy, but I began to have a mood that was brighter than a sunny day: I felt my heart gently floating up! Like a pair of nimble and skillful boats, floating in the warm sea of love; like a strong and tireless eagle, circling in the vast blue sky full of light and warmth.</p>
<p>Gradually, I sank into fantasy: I seemed to feel a force suddenly surging in my body, wanting to sing loudly, or run freely...</p>
<p>Afterwards, I really wanted to kneel down and kiss this fragrant land, and thank Heaven—how lovely this world is!</p>
<p>I murmured, smiling to myself, thinking of many, many things. (Copied in March, 1947)</p>
<h3>A Record of the Gongchuo Hall</h3>
<p>— Lü Baihua</p>
<p>Those who have read "On Saving the Nation Through Transportation" all know of Mr. Ye Gongchuo, a great recluse in the city, an advanced scholar in the court, who assisted the Premier in managing finances and establishing railways, his contributions were truly great. But few know that his economic writings were the first to advocate new learning. In his early years, Mr. Ye studied at the local school and came under the tutelage of Mr. Zhang Wenda of Changsha. Mr. Zhang Wenda, when revolutionary ideas were being passed on, had a long-standing tradition. Since his interactions with the Premier, he strongly advocated that education must precede transportation, and he established seventy-five railway staff schools. Thus, Jiaotong University in Shanghai was established, and Mr. Ye served as its president. As the name suggests, it is known that Mr. Ye fostered the talent for transportation in China! When the Japanese invaders cunningly invaded China, Mr. Ye closed his door and read the "Book of Changes," comparing himself to Ji Zi in the "Ming Yi" hexagram, "suffering internal difficulties but able to maintain his will." Now, transportation friends, compelled by admiration, wishing to make some memorial, they changed the name of the workshop hall, which Mr. Ye established on the school grounds in his early years, to "Gongchuo Hall." They will enshrine Mr. Ye's staff within it. Although the avant-garde is not yet complete, the wood framework is viewable, which is also sufficient to revive decline! This is the record.</p>
<h3>Ode to Spring</h3>
<p>— Lin Yongquan</p>
<p>Last night——</p>
<p>Near dusk, the sky spread out an even thicker black curtain, and a gust of wind blew in the opposite direction from usual. The earth was darkened, and the windows were closed.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was a power outage, and the room was also pitch black. In the blur between wakefulness and sleep, I heard many sounds outside. At first, they were rustling, then gradually chirping, and then evolving into howling and whistling. I knew it was raining. "Last night, I heard the spring rain in the small building, and tomorrow morning, apricot blossoms will be sold in the deep alley." The scenery tomorrow morning will be different.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the sun poked out from the top of the small mountain in the east with its young, bright red cheeks, and I woke up. I was awakened by the intense red light, pushed awake by the irresistible vitality of youth.</p>
<p>Almost every day, I get up very quietly and silently, doing the things that should be done every morning. Now, there is one more procedure in my life, which is to change the water and trim the flowers, leaves, and branches of the seasonal flowers that I bought yesterday morning! Like a girl's dressing up, this takes almost half an hour. The morning sun gradually left the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>When I stood up from the edge of the bed and opened the window that had been closed all night, I clearly felt a group of fresh morning winds bouncing and jumping in, followed by the fragrance of rapeseed flowers in the garden, the fragrance of new buds in the forest trees, the fragrance of new grass in the meadow...all coming together in unison. And the peach blossoms, pear blossoms, and wild gardenia blossoms in the vase: the fragrance that spread throughout the house overnight mixed with those that sneaked in from outside the window, forming a formation of fragrances, a procession of fragrances.</p>
<p>They are too lively, even more harmonious and affectionate. They are strolling everywhere, traveling everywhere...</p>
<p>This is the best time for reading, so I carried my strongest joy and my favorite verses out into the courtyard, and they were still surrounding me. Were they laughing with their shoulders together? Were they scattering light smoke-like fine hair, dancing in circles and singing low-pitched songs?</p>
<p>This is truly happiness, truly the most precious moment in the world!</p>
<p>On the road, I opened my arms to the flat road flashing with white sunlight, what a comfortable breath! I further measured the road with the broadest stride, then puffed out my chest and walked into the vegetable garden with my whole body.</p>
<p>I knew they were still following me, accompanying me all the way. And I also saw that there were others playing and chatting everywhere, and many more were floating in from afar on the boundless fields.</p>
<p>Again immersing myself in the sea of rice, this sea has undergone several changes. This green, this green field that drank a night of drunkenness, is even greener. The roots and buds that have been imprisoned in the dry soil for many days began to wriggle out from the soft cakes, stretching out their arms and legs, and the verdant leaves stretched upwards into the sky and spread out to the neighboring sky with all their vitality.</p>
<p>Some grains—especially the gathering of boundless broad beans, each of their oval-shaped small leaves was soaked with some small shiny water liquid. They cannot yet condense into beads, so we are unwilling to call them dew. The origin is nothing more than the remnants of those fine fog networks.</p>
<p>But under this sunlight, under the gaze of this excessively affectionate eye; all the grains and weeds show the vitality of life, show the luxuriant vitality, because of it—the fog network left behind.</p>
<p>The sun gradually climbed up the higher steps.</p>
<p>That field of yellow flowers has already begun to be lively. I don't know when, bees and butterflies from near and far have rushed to the scene like they were hurrying to a fair. And that place has become intoxicated all day long, with unceasing songs and secret words—perhaps also mixed with some gorgeous struggles and quarrels...these, we cannot distinguish.</p>
<p>Those robust broad beans, in addition to using their combined physique to form a wave-like sea, also have small gray flowers dotted under each layer of flat leaves. Those flowers also form a large mass of simple, rustic, but not sweet fragrance. All the bees and butterflies also came smelling the fragrance. But mostly the small gray butterflies, which resemble the flowers and seem to have a relationship with the same race, always kiss and attach to the underside of the flower petals for a long time.</p>
<p>There are also those small birds, those unnamed moth-like small birds, also flying quickly and chirping on the湛green sea of grains...who knows why this is? Or do they also love this sea, have their companions been lost in the sea? Escaped to the depths of the sea…Are they searching? Calling?</p>
<p>The tall poplars by the side of the road, whose leaves were completely torn off by the winter wind, also protruded new buds on their dry-looking branches, like tadpoles in a pond in April, crowded beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Children wearing various costumes can also be seen everywhere, working together with their mothers and all the relatives, who are older but still full of spring feelings; just like some colorful small petals scattered on the ground, and one or two large flower buds and a few large leaves.</p>
<p>The girls always walk hand in hand, are they conveying warmth to each other? Are they making another hypothetical entrustment to each other?</p>
<p>The wind is coming. The fog is also gradually dispersing. The distant mountains are clearly displayed again. Please open the eyes that were just in a dream and look into the distance, is the distance also busy with spring? (Kunming Army Station, Spring, 1947)</p>
<h3>Four Poems on Spring Willows</h3>
<p>— Shi Liangfu</p>
<p>Last year, Qingyun Books and Periodicals planned to print an enlarged edition for the New Year. The editor, Mr. Jiang Xiaoyou, urgently requested poems and paintings. I hastily wrote and sent an old work, "Spring Willows," in response. After it was published, I was honored to receive praise from Mr. Lu Mangwu and Mr. Chang, which brought me a lot of comfort. This spring, after being ill, I am sitting idle and bored, so I continued with four more poems. After careful consideration, I respectfully submit them to Mr. Jinshan for his criticism.</p>
<p>First Poem:</p>
<p>A stretch of misty water locks the pond,</p>
<p>A thin silk dress, a light makeup adorns.</p>
<p>The cuckoo cries sadly in the continuous night rain,</p>
<p>The spring breeze arrives first at the study hall.</p>
<p>Poetic sentiments sway in the gossamer,</p>
<p>Free spirit rushes along the official road.</p>
<p>Tell you, young green willows by the roadside,</p>
<p>The young woman in the boudoir has boundless grief!</p>
<p>Second Poem:</p>
<p>Green as mist in the sound of the cuckoo,</p>
<p>It is again the second month in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Standing idly in front of the door, feelings lingering,</p>
<p>Peeking out from behind the curtain, resentment continuous.</p>
<p>The wind drags emerald shadows to invade the study window,</p>
<p>Flowers bring a pure fragrance to fall on the inkstone.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Jingjie ascended to immortality,</p>
<p>For whom does the light or heavy makeup adorn?</p>
<p>Third Poem:</p>
<p>The slender waist can barely support itself,</p>
<p>Emerald eyebrows lightly outlined in a painting.</p>
<p>Southern beauty is extraordinarily lovely,</p>
<p>The petite figure is as soft as wood.</p>
<p>A bend of water encircles the Azure Dragon reclined,</p>
<p>Three paths of flowers are like snow spread.</p>
<p>Pointing to the old Marquis residence in Wuchang,</p>
<p>Intolerable past events are vaguely remembered!</p>
<p>Fourth Poem:</p>
<p>Leaning on the railing on the left, next to the building on the right,</p>
<p>Suitable for joy, suitable for delight, truly charming and shy.</p>
<p>Although the beacon fire is urgent at the edge of Lianhai,</p>
<p>The scenery of the pavilions is still serene.</p>
<p>A rain does not prevent the change of old appearance,</p>
<p>Why do the double eyebrows lock deep sorrow?</p>
<p>Yesterday, someone was expected after dusk,</p>
<p>A crescent moon hangs above the jade梢head.</p>
<h3>Little Artist</h3>
<p>— Renoir</p>
<p>Auguste Renoir (1847-1919) was a painter who lived in poverty throughout his life. Like Sisley, it was common for him to go three or four days without bread. However, he did not give up painting because of this, and he continued to work hard every day. Finally, he discovered the principles of Impressionism and became a major general of the Impressionist school. His works often feature figures, mostly nudes, with bright colors and soft brushstrokes. The subject and background are blended together, creating a very rich feeling. In his later years, he suffered from hemiplegia and could not stand. He lived in seclusion in Cagnes-sur-Mer in southern France, sitting in an automatic chair all day long and continuing to work. He lived to be seventy-one years old. (Lion)</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 307</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>At the same time, he did not forget to study this young maid; although she was not very beautiful, she was not unpleasant, and she had the appearance of Kikuko in Matsushima. Her actions were very quick, and it seemed that she had received athletic training in school. What was especially noticeable was her pair of sharp and alert eyes. This time when she entered the room, while answering and speaking, she had already noticed the strange note on the floor. Tsurumi's eyes could not ignore these details.</p>
<p>The maid listened to Tsurumi's instructions and withdrew in less than a minute. Tsurumi's subordinate had already entered the room to pay his respects.</p>
<p>"Zhengyan-kun...sit down and talk!" Tsurumi had always been this casual with his subordinates, unless there were senior colleagues present.</p>
<p>"Captain!" This subordinate sat down uneasily, "I was late in welcoming you this morning, ten minutes late, and I came to Daoli to apologize. The young lady who came to Shanghai with you, Captain, instructed me to come back at 10:20." As he spoke, he stood up again, gave a fake salute, and formally apologized.</p>
<p>"Did you receive Secretary-General Yue's message?" Tsurumi meant that Zhengyan had received the news of his arrival in Shanghai.</p>
<p>"There were several messages, regarding the "eight" 松character, noting the Captain's and her joint actions." Zhengyan sat down again.</p>
<p>"Are there any other important messages?"</p>
<p>"The biggest news is about Commander Hasegawa Kiyoshi...the fleet under his command is about to move out."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Tsurumi was a little shaken. This Commander Hasegawa's fleet, naval marines, and water bomber squadron, and water mine brigade, were well-known for their bravery and ruthlessness among the various fleets. This move was a symbol of a major landing, and Tsurumi could not help but be a little shaken.</p>
<p>"Anything else?" Tsurumi was stunned for a moment, and pondered for a while. "Also, Song, Lan, Mei, each action team has been mobilized. From three to four o'clock this morning, two teams of team members came south by chance. Some of them are stationed in Shanghai, and some have gone to Nanjing."</p>
<p>Yamamoto Zhengyan is a Taiwanese mixed-race, born in Shanghai, received elementary education locally, and studied in Japan for middle school. After graduation, he entered the Telecommunications Technology College. After interning in the Northeast for two years, he was assigned to Shanghai, and has always been under the command of Tsurumi. In Tsurumi's organization, he is number "013". After arriving in Shanghai, he still used Yamamoto in terms of duties, but privately, he used the three characters Lin Zhengyan, the reason being "convenient for handling affairs." He is about the same age as Tsurumi, twenty-six or seven years old. Although his mind is not very flexible, he is very loyal to Tsurumi; and he can always move forward.</p>
<p>"Who did the Lan team send?" Tsurumi has always been paying attention to Doihara.</p>
<p>"A total of four people, three of whom are women. According to the list, the leader is "Special No. 8" Kawashima Yoshiko; so far, she has not been seen coming to the department, perhaps she has not come south at all."</p>
<p>"Kawashima Yoshiko!" Tsurumi repeated this name, "That is some special team outside of the Lan team—a satellite of the Lan team—that old thing is preparing for a major expansion..."</p>
<p>"In reality, only one man and one woman have reported, and there is also someone called Mizi, who has not been seen." Zhengyan continued his report: "Their mission seems very urgent..."</p>
<h3>Starting from Zhao Xiangzi's Heavy Drinking</h3>
<p>— Bu Shu</p>
<p>"Dongpo Zhilin" records such a joke:</p>
<p>"There were two scholars who were talking about their ambitions. One said: 'The only things I lack in my life are food and sleep; when I succeed in the future, I will eat my fill and then sleep, and sleep and then eat.' The other said: 'I am different from you, I will eat and then eat, how can I have time to sleep?'"</p>
<p>Neither of these two scholars wants to "載通," if they can write articles, they would naturally belong to the "expressing ambition faction." One is eating and sleeping, the other is simply eating. The things are very funny, so they should only be seen as jokes.</p>
<p>However, there are also jokes that cannot always be seen as jokes.</p>
<p>"Zhao Xiangzi drank alcohol, for five days and five nights without stopping. He said to the servant: 'I am truly a noble person! I have been drinking for five days and five nights, and I am not sick at all.' You Mo said: 'Your Majesty, please work harder, you are only two days short of Zhou.' Zhou drank for seven days and seven nights, now you are five days and five nights. Xiangzi was shocked and asked You Mo: 'Then I will perish?' You Mo said: 'You will not perish.' Xiangzi said: 'I am only two days short of Zhou, why will I not perish?' You Mo said: 'Jie and Zhou perished because they met Tang and Wu. Now the world is full of Jie, and you are Zhou. Jie and Zhou are in the same era, how can they perish together? However, it is also almost over.'" (Liu Xiang: Xin Xu)</p>
<p>The two scholars suffered because they lacked broad knowledge, only knowing how to eat and sleep; Zhao Xiangzi was the same, drinking alcohol for five days and five nights without getting sick, so he was elated. ——He forgot that although Shang Xin could drink for seven days and seven nights, the ending was still a monarch who lost his country.</p>
<p>It is impossible to open up the future history by simply eating and sleeping. You Mo said: "Jie and Zhou are in the same era, how can they perish together?" In fact, it is not entirely true. There is Zhou who only knows how to drink, and there is also Jie who only knows how to kill and plunder. Jie and Zhou can also be divided into big and small, strong and weak. The annexation of various countries during the Spring and Autumn period is an example of the mutual destruction of Jie and Zhou.</p>
<p>I once read an essay about Auteuil, which mentioned the "historical affairs" department of France before World War II, saying:</p>
<p>"Countless people with poetic inspiration have devoted all their efforts to the entertainment of Parisians. At first, it was archery. Some young girls slept in hammocks, and some young men shot bullets at a target, and then the hammock fell down, and the girls screamed shrilly and fell into a rather pleasing group. From shooting to targets, these literati turned to swimming. The girls sank into the water in front of those moved Gigoers, and the young men drank Cechtuilo while sighing at those beauties covered in rain."</p>
<p>This was the entertainment of the French gentry in the early 1940s. Although it is not a secret of the war, it reveals the true reason for the French defeat. The behavior of the young men was naturally much more generous than Zhao Xiangzi's drinking. It is naturally much more generous than the scholars dreaming of eating and sleeping. But there are still more generous pleasures, which were invented after swimming and shooting.</p>
<p>"The Parisians among the Qing automobiles do not like the herdsmen's horses. The poets have found a solution. They have lowered the status of girls to be the same as汽军. A dance floor called Tcoxic-Gtgx has opened in Paris. Customers buy tickets, and the tickets give them the right to have girls. Those girls have numbers on their chests: T.G. is priced at one and a half francs. Customers can invite those young girls to dance, he can drool, sniffle, or make people smell bad: this is his right."</p>
<p>Swimming, shooting, automobile girl dances, these great events are all things that the French rulers of 1933 praised. They were dizzy for several years, while Hitler made guns for several午. Once something happened, the elegant and refined French army collapsed. After Paris fell, they raised the white flag, wrote elegies, and it was over. And this is another example of the mutual destruction of Jie and Zhou.</p>
<p>Using Jie to attack Zhou, everything is almost the same. However, Jie, who previously loved guns, will slowly start to love swimming and shooting after the world is at peace, or even invent more pleasures. The more glories there are, the more it shows that this world can still progress in "mutual destruction".</p>
<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>The Rats of Nanchang</h3>
<p>— You Jin</p>
<p>In middle school, I read the fairy tales of the blind poet Eroшенко. When he described Li Hongzhang, he said that Li Hongzhang was a nation that ate rats. I was very unfair to Li Hongzhang, because I and Li Hongzhang were fellow villagers. Because I did not eat rats, it was enough to prove that Li Hongzhang would never eat rats. I thought that the Russian's rumors were really hateful!</p>
<p>Later, I gradually learned that some southerners do eat rats, and this time the plague in Nanchang was caused by eating stir-fried rats.</p>
<p>According to reports, Mr. Li Xueqiao (from Guangdong) and his wife, both employees of the Jiangxi Provincial Audit Office, ate stir-fried rats together and died together! According to the doctor: "Usually, eating a rat is not a big deal. The rats eaten by the Li couple this time were probably not cooked thoroughly, and the bacteria were not killed. Once eaten, the bacteria invaded the lymph nodes, causing death."</p>
<p>The plague bacillus was discovered, and the plague spread. The number of deaths increased day by day, and Nanchang "talked about rats and changed color"!</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the plague was very serious at the junction of Fujian and Zhejiang. Now it is gradually spreading from south to north and from east to west. Jiangxi did not have much plague in the past, but now it is also spreading. It is really terrible!</p>
<p>Of course, even if Mr. and Mrs. Li had not eaten rats, the spread of the plague would still be unstoppable, but Mr. and Mrs. Li might not have died immediately at the same time. The ancients said: "Disease enters through the mouth, and disaster comes out of the mouth." Now, according to the situation of Mr. and Mrs. Li, we have to change it and say: "Disaster enters through the mouth, and disease comes out of the mouth." If they hadn't eaten stir-fried rats, they wouldn't have immediately caused a fatal disaster; isn't that "disaster entering through the mouth"? As for "disease coming out of the mouth", that is even more obvious. The plague was confirmed by the death of Mr. and Mrs. Li, so of course it is so-called "disease coming out of the mouth".</p>
<p>The desire for food and drink, the disaster of which is so severe! This is more terrible than "risking death to eat pufferfish," rather die than not eat pufferfish, which is even more terrible! Our strange and delicious nation!</p>
<h3>Sichuan and the People of Sichuan</h3>
<p>— Liu Ling</p>
<p>Sichuan is a province with very rich products, and the people of this province often take pride in "the Land of Abundance" or "the Revival Site of the Anti-Japanese War". However, I once heard a person from another province with too deep prejudices angrily say. "Forget it, it's useless even if there are many products, the sugar is not sweet, the salt is not salty, the oranges have no orange flavor..." This is of course a near-foolish slander. No one can demand that the products of a place be good and standard in every item. I love Sichuan's Guanggan oranges, the small peanuts of Ciqikou, the ornaments and snacks of Chengdu, and that unique local sentiment.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the scenery of the entire Sichuan area is very good, with mountains and rivers and lush trees. Many place names, such as Begonia Creek, Misty Rain Fort, and Red Bean Tree, can illustrate this point. In terms of language expression, knowledgeable people speak "somewhat literary", especially elegant. Beautiful women are produced, but ordinary women are short and fat - some people call them "water buckets".</p>
<p>I admire the eloquence of the people of Sichuan very much. Sometimes, a person with very low knowledge speaks "logically" and is quite able to justify himself. In various parts of Sichuan, there are particularly many teahouses, and business is quite prosperous. Reasoning, doing business, meeting, and eating tea摆龙阵 (idle chatter) are all carried out there. Every day, how many people sit in teahouses, talk, and pass the time.</p>
<p>Apart from the generally hateful profiteers and snobs, the people of Sichuan are very polite, and the concept of old morals is very deep. They are relatively conservative, greedy for small comforts, and more or less have a bit of xenophobia.</p>
<h3>Arts and Culture Scene</h3>
<p>The atmosphere of translation in Chengdu is quite strong. Currently residing in Chengdu are the following literary translators: Lin Ru, the translator of "Zola's Biography"; Luo Yujun, the translator of "The Red and the Black"; as well as Luo Niansheng, Xie Wenbing, Chen Xianghe, Chen Weimo, and others, all engaged in translation work. Ms. Nei Luo Wang is a female writer who studied in France and has a deep understanding of French literature.</p>

<p>He Jiahuai is still recuperating in the Minsheng Sanatorium in his hometown of Yiwu. Although he is recovering from a serious illness, he has not yet fully recovered and can only barely hold a pen. The doctor advises him not to overwork his brain.</p>
<p>— Ziyue</p>
<p>The Hong Kong weekly magazine "The Masses" has recently released its eighth issue. This issue contains the full text of Song Zhi's reportage "On the Battlefield," which is quite long and only published in three installments.</p>

<p>The culture of Guilin is extremely depressed. There is only one monthly magazine, "Jiliu," edited by the poet Ai Sen. Because the prices in Guilin are very high, publishing magazines always results in losses, and "Jiliu" is naturally no exception.</p>

<h3>"Pyramid"</h3>
<p>— Feichen</p>
<p>An executive of an American airline discovered a giant "pyramid" in the barren mountains southeast of Xi'an, Shaanxi. The history of this "pyramid" is likely unknown to anyone at present.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will once again use an "Ah Q" mentality to proclaim to others the richness of ancient China, unmatched by any culturally advanced country.</p>
<p>Wasn't the principle of airplanes and the invention of explosives all invented by the "yellow-faced," "queue-wearing" descendants of the Chinese people in the five-thousand-year-old ancient country?</p>
<p>What is one "pyramid" worth? Egypt has "pyramids," and now you see: China also has "pyramids"! Moreover, according to the report of this American airline colonel, this giant "pyramid," if compared with the Egyptian pyramids, would truly "pale in comparison." Chinese people, upon hearing this, who shouldn't be "beaming with joy"!</p>
<p>But sadly, the Chinese people are born both "poor" and "busy." A "pyramid" "about one thousand feet high and one thousand five hundred feet in circumference" has been buried in the barren mountains of southern Shaanxi for who knows how many ages!</p>
<p>If no foreign plane had flown over this "barren mountain," we would be hard-pressed to say whether this "pyramid" would be discovered even after another half-century or a century.</p>
<p>Blame it on our people, who have been too busy to turn around and too poor to breathe for the past fifty years. Who would care about any "pyramid"!</p>
<p>Now that this "rare treasure" has finally been discovered, I wonder if our poor and busy people have the leisure to do "surveying" and "archaeological" work.</p>
<h3>Multifaceted Musical Genius</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>Perhaps it's because I myself am incompetent, otherwise why would I find it so admirable to worship geniuses and multifaceted individuals? Such talent is not only something I find difficult to achieve, but also very astonishing. Let's talk about a few musicians and music writers:</p>
<p>The great musician Mozart could compose at the age of four. The recently deceased Caruso was an outstanding singer and also a sculptor. The Fascist demon Mussolini was once called the first violinist of Italy, and his literature was also very famous. The Polish politician and revolutionary giant Paderewski was a prominent pianist and composer of modern times.</p>
<p>The current violinists Elman, Heifetz, and Menuhin were all performing difficult musical pieces at the age of eleven or twelve. Kreisler is a long-established violinist who is also a composer. His piano and painting skills are also very good. Not only that, but he can also speak eight different languages and has a solid foundation in Greek and Latin. In addition, he is also a researcher in mathematics, philosophy, and pharmacology. This is truly versatile.</p>
<p>The Chinese musician Ma Sicong publicly performed the violin in Paris at the age of eleven. At that time, newspapers all over Europe used large headlines to record our glorious prodigy. Now he is a very famous composer and violinist in China. He also plays the piano very well. Ma Sihong is his younger brother, who at the age of thirteen was already performing the huge violin piece – Spanish Symphony (Latos Symphonie Espagnole). Violinist Tan Shuzhen is also an architect. He is very outstanding in sculpture and Western painting, especially in the manufacture and repair of violins, which can be considered very researched.</p>
<p>Someone said: "Genius and versatility are not miracles, as long as you study subjects that suit your learning and personality and do not go down the wrong path. Then there is great hope, unless there are health defects." Let's ask ourselves if we have any health defects? Which subjects or techniques are we proficient in? If we think we are too old, then we should pay attention to our children, they are the buds of genius and versatility. This not only fulfills a great responsibility to our children, but also our supreme glory.</p>
<h3>Record of a City in Crisis</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The voices of two women had already launched into a fierce quarrel. He curiously walked to the small window and pushed open the two paper-covered window panels.</p>
<p>Outside was a small alley five or six feet wide. The alley entrance connected to the Liuhe Road outside. There were three or four households in the alley and at the end, all living in Hong Kong-style and Shanghai-style bungalows with names like "Shulu" and "Qiyuan" written on the doors. They had always been inhabited by the most comfortable people in Guilin – political dignitaries or bank managers. At this time, Old Zhu turned his face to look out and could vaguely see a large truck parked at the alley entrance. Five or six workers in the alley were moving goods and boxes, and one or two shrewd and capable guys were directing, all looking very nervous; but the loudest voices were a group of children, about four or five, some arguing and some crying, but the adults didn't care about them at all. Outside the bamboo fence gate of the garden house at the end of the alley, two women were raising their voices, arguing like fighting cocks.</p>
<p>"...Why didn't you leave last time? I don't care! You can't get on the car this time...!" A Ningbo-accented woman said decisively.</p>
<p>"Bullshit! This is the pharmacy's car, everyone can ride!" Another Tianjin-accented woman's voice was not weak either, and her shrewishness seemed to be even greater than the Ningbo woman.</p>
<p>"We decided a long time ago that it can't be changed!" The Ningbo woman immediately retorted. "We asked you to leave last time; this time it's the second car, and it was agreed that it would only take our family. No one else can even think about getting on the car!"</p>
<p>The Tianjin woman seemed to feel she was in the wrong, and paused slightly.</p>
<p>"Are you being unreasonable?" She launched a preemptive strike. "The situation is so tense today, do you want our family of four to die in Guilin?"</p>
<p>"Hmph, am I being unreasonable?" The other woman sneered. "Why didn't you take us with you when you left last time? Now it's our turn, and you want to take over! It's absolutely impossible! Even if your Mr. Zhang comes, he has to be reasonable. Who said that last time?"</p>
<p>"It wasn't that we didn't want to leave last time!" The Tianjin woman's mind was very quick, and she came up with another idea in a moment. "It was your Mr. Che who refused to stop loading things, so there wasn't even room for people to sit..."</p>
<p>"Things? Aren't those things yours too?" There's always someone better, the woman's thoughts were even quicker. "You just wanted to be comfortable. You didn't leave last time because you said you wanted to be careful and stable, you didn't want a small package, and you still dragged us down, you're shameless!" (132)</p>
<h3>Long-Winded Speech</h3>
<p>— Guo</p>
<p>"A politician was giving a speech, which lasted for several hours. The audience was bored to death, but he was unaware!</p>
<p>"What I am saying now is for the benefit of the next generation."</p>
<p>An impatient person stood up and shouted: "Yes, if you don't hurry up, they're about to come in and listen to you!"</p>
<h3>Waiting for the Bus</h3>
