<h3>美國會召開特別會議</h3>
<p>美國國會於昨日起召開特別會議，總統杜魯門並蒞會致辭。此一特別會議之召開，意義相當重要，且在美國歷史上亦爲不常經見之事。照例，美國國會將於明年一月復會於美京，除非有特別重要之事，往往避免有國會特別會議的召開。「特別」會議，顧名思義，事出非常；美國自立國以來，在過去的一百五十年中，僅開過二十五次國會特別會議。此次杜魯門總統引用了美國憲法所賦予的職權，於上月廿三日，咨文國會定本月十七日召開國會特別會議，是爲美國歷史上之第二十六次國會特別會議。此一特別會議的召開，很明顯地，表示杜魯門總統已認爲目前是一個非常嚴重的時會，因而國會有召開特別會議的必要。由於最近國際事態的發展，此一國會特別會議的召開，不備有關美國國內政治的發展，抑且與此後世界局勢的推移，頗有影響。因之，此一特別會議的召開，不僅爲美國八民所關心，且爲世界各地人民所注意。</p>
<p>我們到如今，卽撰稿時止，遠沒有機會讀到杜魯門總統的咨文。但據各新聞社傳來的消息，不難竊見此次召開國會特別會議的目的，是在如何求世界的安定，求美國本身的安定。所爾歐洲復興計劃（ERP），卽馬歇爾的援歐計劃，和如何控制美國國內的通貨膨脹趨勢，其目的無非在謀世界，特別是西歐和美國的安定。據報傳消息，美政府將請國會准予動用美金五億九千七百萬元，作爲援助法義及奧大利的臨時緊急救濟，一面杜魯門總統將籲請平抑物價以遏止通貨膨脹的趨勢。關於援歐的長期計劃，卽在此後四年間估計所需的一百二十億或一百七十億美元，是否將在此次國會特別會議中提出或考慮，我們迄未得到證實的消息。無論歐洲復興計劃的全部是否將在此次國會特別會議中提出考慮，此次國會特別會議的召開，無疑地，對於整個世界局勢及美國的國內局勢，必將有一番檢討和決定的作用。</p>
<p>從目前的種種跡象，此次國會特別會議的召開，將是對杜魯門總統的一個重要考騐。目前美國的國會已爲共和黨所按制，民主黨的杜魯門總統在此次國會特別會議上，似難期運轉的靈活。因之，杜魯門總統企圖將援歐計劃及控制物價計劃作爲一種超於黨派利益而爲舉國一致所支持的政策；究竟國會議員，多數是共和黨人，能否接受此一政策，自有待於此後事實的證明，但據目前的種種跡象，杜魯門總統可能遭遇到難關。</p>
<p>第一，從對外政第方面上言，自從馬歇爾元帥返美就任國務卿以後，美國對於遠東，迄無明確堅定的政策。魏德邁將軍的報吿，到如今還擱在國務院的保險箱內，沒有發表；而馬歇爾的援歐計劃，其數目却特別龐大。共和黨議員若塔虎脫等，對此早有抨擊，認爲援歐計劃必須與援華計劃同時提出，始能有整個的世界計劃。據「時代」周刋上的報道，馬歇爾終於爲了應付國會的壓力，改變他所主張的對華靜觀政策，提出了他的三億援華計劃。此與他所提的援歐計劃，誠屬不堪此擬。可見國會與政府方面在對外政策上，觀點尙未盡同。就現有的消息，謂國會將僅考慮援歐的臨時計劃，但就是這一臨時計劃，能否完全爲國會所支持，似乎也不無問題。</p>
<p>第二，講到美國國內的局勢，杜魯門總統的不主張减稅，此與共和黨的政策亦不免相左。共和黨爲了明年總統的競選，自然想爭取選民：而爭取選民的一個惟一妙法便在减稅，如今援歐的計劃，數字龐大，在杜魯門總統，以爲此一龐大的數字，必須賴稅收以支應，以免通貨的膨脹。然共和黨議，目的看法，或未必如此。至於講到如何控制美國物價的狂漲，如果杜魯門總統主張恢復戰時的物價管制，或定量分配制度，共和黨人或亦不樂於接受。所以就在對內政策方面，杜魯門總統的政策，與爲共和黨所控制的國會，亦未必能乳水交融。</p>
<p>可是我們站在第三者的客觀地位，從一個遠大的角度，却希望此次國會特別會議的召開，能有令人滿意的成就。目前距大戰的結東已兩年了，而整個世界尙在動盡不安中。在這動盪不安的世界中，美國無疑地是惟一的安定力量。我們願美國的政治家能有世界的遠大眼光，不爲一己的成見所固執，不爲黨派的政爭而拘牽，對於目前整個世界的局勢能作通盤打算；惟有這樣，纔不失爲世界的領導。</p>
<h3>主席接受法勳章</h3>
<p>（上接一版）「主席閣下：余奉法國總統之命，敬獲親向閣下頒授軍事勳章，深感榮幸。中國抗戰之英雄，勇毅無倫，本國政府，無限欽仰，閣下運籌帷幄，實爲表率，用特授贈法國最高之軍事勳章，藉彰嘉猷，當年中法兩軍，聯合作戰，遂使兩國連擊，因之瀰固，頒茲榮典，永誌不忘，觀彼舉敵，肆其猖狂，中法民族，均悉侵略，禍患之酷烈，淬厲奮發，爲祖國自由而死戰，勝利之旌旗，終隨凱歌而飛揚。中法人民，今日翹望前途，無不懐望異日之世界，成爲自由正義之樂土，俾五口後世，永免蹂躪與流血之慘痛。此次授勳意義之重大，授勳詞中，業已備述，此詞實乃依據法軍之通令者也。茲謹向閣下宣讀於次：</p>
<p>中華民國國民政府蔣主席，以其對本國前途，抱有堅定不移之信念，首先奮起抵禦極權帝國主義，對各和平民族之侵略。溯自一九三七年七月七日領導全國人民，力禦外侮，寗旰辛勤，百折不撓，始而孤軍當戰，繼與盟邦合作無問，領導指揮此光榮而艱苦之戰鬥，歷時入載，終至日寇俯首來降，主持此一最爲堅難之抗戰之以越領袖，寶已贏得所有民主國家永世不忘之讀頌與惑戴。」</p>
<h3>日賠償物資良好</h3>
<p>（上接一版）關於日本全部賠償物資之處理，周氏謂：現正由東京賠償還問委員會繼續商對中，先期拆遷之第二批物資，包括海陸空軍兵工廠之試騐研究及人造橡皮等設備，各國分配數額，短期內即可獲得協議。渠對賠償觀問委會內空氣之融洽，表示欣慰，認係任何國際組織所罕見，惟渠預料在計件賠償工具處理完畢，開始處理整廠拆選時，各國將不免有所爭執。周氏繼提醒國人對賠償物資之認識稱：賠償物資並非嚴銅爛鐵，根據余等參觀一百餘家日本工廠後之觀感，日本工廠之品質，一般均甚良好，日本工廠使用世界上最進步之製造方法，甚至在化工工業方面，美國亦望　莫及，故吾人對賠償物資，返應加以重視。蓋因賠償物資之獲得，其意義除在限制日本之工業水準外，並在藉此以建立我國之基礎工業。</p>

<h3>美國會特會召開杜魯門力請援歐　並提十項基本經濟措置</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約十七日廣播：華盛頓訊，美國有史以來之第二十六屆國會特會於今日十時召開，衆院議長馬丁與參院主席范登堡分別宣布開會後，杜魯門總統(見圖）即出席致詞，就援歐及防止國內通貨膨脹兩　帶問題，闡明政府態度。渠力主以五億九千七百萬美元，作為對義·法·奧三國之緊急援助，並為防止對美國國內之經濟局勢起見，特提出十項基本措置：　凡國內缺乏而足以影響人民生活之消費品，應實施配給；　凡國內缺乏而足以影響人民生活之生產品，應規定限價，並為實行規定限價起見，應對工資作適常限制；　加强房金管制；　統制稀少而對生活有密切關係之物資；　投機性商品交易應予管制；　限制銀行放款；　加强出口管制；　繼續管制運輸工具及配備之分配；　限制以穀類飼養家畜家禽，俾使榖類用以更切實之需要；　授權農業部草擬計劃，俾鼓勵人民儲藏食物，並設法增加國外之生產。</p>
<p>杜魯門總統對馬歇爾之援歐計劃力予讚揚。據馬卿估計，美國在四年之內，援歐數額，約在　一百六十億至二百億之間，總統力促國會迅速通過對義法奧三國作五億九千七百萬美元之緊急援助，以度今冬難關，認為比一行動，可以證明美國有支持西歐各國保持民主自由之決心，直至其能自給自足為止。茍國會能通過緊急援助，其後復能通過長期援助，則在世界史上將寫下光榮之一頁。但為達成此項目的，國內經濟亦須力求穩定，蓋援歐與經濟統制，係相輔相成者云。</p>
<p>１美國會特會發展影響今後領導權</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓十六日合衆電〕本星期一召開之美國會特別會議，舉世皆將認為美國增强其二次大戰後，在世界之領導地位之意願與能力之衡量尺度。國會完成西歐復興立法之速度與決心，即可以表示歷史潮流究將令美國卸却其戰後在海外所負義不容辭之重大責任，抑或將代之加强其在世界之政治權力。此次國會特別會議，會期將延續至明年一月三日正常國會召開時止，各領袖人士，雖將遵照特別會議召開之目的，設法使初期之注意力，以集中於臨時援助，暨防止通貨膨脹辦法等問題為限，但國會規程仍許在明年一月以前，向國會提出其他問題。</p>
<p>尚待國會正式會議處理之其他問題，計有難民之移入，對華一般政策，美國對希土援助之進展與效果，美軍政人員在被佔領國家之行為與風紀，授權「美國之聲」廣播節目或其他新聞機構駁斥共產國際關於美國情狀，海外剩餘物　情况之報導，被佔領國家之通貨，中東油礦情形，暨英美石油協定等問題。美政府並將擇一適當時機，將里約熱內盧泛美安全公約，向參院提請批准。觀之於范登堡與康納利之參加里約熱內盧會議，可知公約可迅獲批准。國會於辯論馬歇爾計劃時，可能將引起對泛美經濟問題之討論。</p>

<p>〔合衆社成功湖十六日電〕美國今日在聯大會中，對於其所提出以一年為期之研究如何緩和及限制五强在安理會使用否決權運動，似有勝利把握。美代表社勒斯昨在一私人會商中吿蘇代表葛羅米柯稱，美國將不顧蘇聯對限制否決權之激烈反對，推行此次運動。</p>
<p>杜氏無異通吿蘇聯，謂將要求對根據憲法和平解決一章下所提交與安理會之案件，及關於允許新會員國加入聯合國之案件中，廢止否決權之使用，如此，則否決權之使用，祇限於　正對和平威脅或侵略之案件矣。據悉，葛羅米柯曾鄭重表示，蘇聯決心保持否決權不變，並反對任何小國對該權之攻擊，聯合國憲章中對否決權條款之任何改變，其本身亦受否決權之約束，故在此時，不問大會要求改變與否，任何實際改變皆屬不可能者。關於此項問題之表決，預料在十七日南非歧視印人案解決以後，即將舉行。</p>
<p>〔合衆社弗魯辛十七日電〕聯合國大會已開始其第十星期，亦可能為一九四七年集會之最後一星期之工作。巴勒斯坦之將來以及五强否決權問題，均尚猶待討論。各代表已同意日夜集會，冀大會能在下星期日結束。巴勒斯坦分治小組會之計劃應於星期三四提出，由大會開始討論，否決權問題料必仿將引起激辯。</p>

<p>提高人民民主程度</p>
<p>席間發表行憲要義稱：中國正向民主大道邁進，我們須切實了解民主之意義，才能得到眞正的民主，所謂眞正的民主，是人民有意見及要求，可由合理合法的手績，向政府表達，而政府一舉一動，亦須尊重民意，如此政府人民方能一體。政府現在規定本月廿一·廿二·廿三·三天舉行大選，十二月廿五日正式行憲，即達到憲政階段，亦即實行民主。所謂行憲，就是使人民由「被治」變爲「自治」，政治由「人治」進爲「法治」，一掃「人存政舉，人亡政息」之弊。人民必須要有管人的權，和管法的權，有選舉好人做事的權，有罷免違反民意官吏的權，有創造自己需要的法律的權，有複決危害人民利益的法律的欋，如此一切事情，都可用以投票來興革，無須動百萬大兵來爭奪。所以這些權是權利，也是責任，凡是公民均不能放棄做主人所應有的資任。民主政治，是投票政治，輕易放棄投票，就是放棄民主政治，那廢國家必定要走向槍彈政治的途徑。至于家是否將走上復與的正道，須看這次選舉時投票者踴躍與否而定。所以希望各位熟烈投票，以提高國格，提高人民民主程度。</p>

<h3>津浦中段踏勘　橋樑旅行</h3>
<p>〔本報泰安十四日航訊〕由兗州至濟南一五六公里問有四座大橋，共匪對於　四座大橋的破壊眞够得上稱爲「煞發苦心」。其中最大的一條爲汶河橋，計大汶河橋長三八六點四公尺，緊接着的小汶河橋長三五一點八公尺，共七三八點二公尺。第二爲泰安以南的泮河橋，長二六五公尺。第三爲萬德南約二公里的葛魚河橋，長三〇四公尺，第四爲張夏南約五公里的石甸河橋，長二一五公尺，（四大橋排列以由南而北爲序）。共匪於破壊此四橋時，據鄕人言，僅汶河橋先後破壊三次，共耗時七十餘日之久，石甸河橋亦耗時四十天，始完成在共匪認爲滿意的破壊程度。</p>
<p>四拱破壊最重</p>
<p>截至記者寫本文爲止，汶河，泮河兩橋，皆早已條復，不過兩橋尙都係便橋，前者計耗枕木達三萬根，後者八千根，有待於重建永久性鋼橋。該路兗泰殷亦已於本月十日起每日對開交通車一次，（兗泰間），葛魚河橋原係十四拱洋灰橋，自被破壊後，靠北面的四拱爲了節省材料，已以泥土塡塞，其餘橋墩，破壊輕者一律修補，重者重修，其中中部破壞最重的四拱，爲按原式重建，需時過久，但爲一勞永逸計，經該局工務處宋副處長連城，課長宋建坊，濟兗搶修大隊安大隊長文調等的「窮思極想」，所謂「總則變，變則通」，乃實行「機橋旅行」，將原距該橋三公里的兩拱廿三公尺鋼橋二節及距此三百六十一公尺廿公尺鋼機二節，分別移置葛魚河上，塡此四孔，（該二橋原經河流，因已淤塞，事實上已無須橋樑），而成了六節拱橋，四節鋼構的永久工程，這在外表上雖然很不雅觀，但於堅附用上，則與新橋一樣</p>
<p>橋樑旅行奇跡</p>
<p>不過「橋樑旅行」，在事實上眞是談何容易。在工具簡陋到萬分，加以客觀環境的限制，僅有的一些工具有時仍無法使用時，斷得該路員工的獨出心栽，匠心別具，好容易把那四節鋼橋「旅行」到葛魚河，因爲該項鋼橋有百噸重的，至少亦是八十噸的，而路同所有起軍機最大只是四十噸，即以兩個四十噸的分兩端同時使用，但靠北的一面由於濟南與外邊交通的隔絕，事實上亦無法運往，因此只可在葛魚河裏普搭枕木，（事實上，因枕木少，還只能兩拱兩搭），把百噸鋼橋，好容易移放枕木上，然後以卅五噸或五十噸的「項鉸」多具，分別放置鋼橋底樑上，慢慢地逐根頂住，逐根把枕木抽去，直到最後鋼橋兩端平穩地洛在石質構敬爲止，今天西北風緊，員工於工作時尤爲戰戰兢兢，戒愼恐懼，藉免意外。</p>
<p>無名建路英雄</p>
<p>石甸河橋的長度，雖在四大橋中最短，但因河深達廿二公尺，故修建時敵發苦心，遠在抗戰末期，日寇爲恐該橋被炸，影響其南北交通，即於原橋西約數百公尺另修一便橋，橋未竣而已日寇投降、遂吿中輟，路局爲謀水久鋼橋的恢復，非短期所能竣事，即就此先建便橋所耗枕木，達一萬一千餘根，而因减少路面坡度，（該處地勢特高）及橋墩深度，將兩岸擊一孔道，長達五公里，十一萬餘土方，耗費六萬餘人工。這誠如安大隊長所說：「我們只可賴人力以補物力之不足。」又說：「全世界工人中最能耐勞吃苦的是巾國工人，全世界工人中在最劣勢工具條件下，對「起重」最有辦法的亦是中國工人。』從這萬餘鐵路員工中，以全部血汗所凝結而成的津浦中段兗濟段，記者目擊後所發生的最大感想是：「共產黨爲了號召並硏究破路的技衛，早就發動一種所謂「爆炸英雄」，共然對此種英雄，公然給予許多物質上及名譽上的鼓勵。反觀政府這一面，像上述宋安等實際上正不知有多少無名的建路英雄，爲了完成祟高的建國工程，又有誰來理睬呢？（本報時派員麗天）</p>

<h3>海甯破獲販賣少女機關　一干犯移送地院審理</h3>

<p>據李金花供係諸暨人，現年十六歲，家內尙有父，名李根錢，母楊氏，因家貧獨人至杭找小伯，擬帮人傭工，因工資太少，後遇褚媽，謂硤石有工可做，工資頗高，乃於上月偕同褚媽來硤，曾被住硤石羣恩路二號之吳朱氏帶赴上海擬費予人家爲丫頭，因價錢不合，乃東返硤，被緊閉於顧祥實家。後有竇生大媽者，（住硤石下東衛石欄橋），介紹二松江人，擬以十五担穀及若千現鈔買去，金花得悉此事，始知受騙，抵死不從，堅請放其歸家。顧祥置乃邀來二人，一穿黃色制服佩木壳槍，一穿靑布長衫，戴呢帽，向其威嚇，適爲警局前來，始脫火窟。警局撼供，乃再派幹員分頭逮捕有關人犯。</p>
<p>又路仲鎭自衛隊捉獲之販賣人口販宋小狗，買主沈三毛及被騙少女秦朱梅，已於十五日解局，由司法科偵訊。據秦珠梅供稱：杭縣人，住杭州孩兒巷口，因不堪晚娘虐待，逃出家庭，在路中遇一婦人，（即在硤捕獲之董王氏），誘騙來硤，在宋小狗家居住，於十日日被誘騙至路仲北城事沈三毛家，有沈三毛帶其至路仲街上網船匯王家二嬸母家，擬以米十担出賣，後得悉秦珠梅來歷不明，不願收受，並報告路仲鎭目衛隊，此有計劃組織之買飯少女案，乃告破獲。</p>
<p>當局以此案關係軍大，被騙少女，恐尙不僅李金花及秦珠梅二人，現正繼續偵緝中，可能再有新發現。</p>

<h3>地質學年會在台舉行具有學術上特殊意義</h3>
<p>台灣地質調査所長畢慶昌</p>
<p>中國地質學會，將於十一千八日起，在台灣台北舉行第二十三屆年會。首三日為論文會，宣讀地質學，礦物學，岩石學，確床學，及古生物學之論文凡百餘篇，隨後按日赴台北附近之烏來，山子脚，及大屯出旅行，硏究台島特有之地層。最後則分組赴苗東油田及金瓜石礦山，各考察兩日。中國地質學會已成立了二十五年，爲我國歷史最久之學術團體之一，復因二十五年來活動之從未中輟，實實在在表現了中國地實硏究之不能的進步。這回它在台灣開會，就全國言，是光復後的第一個學術國體的年會；就台灣言，不論在光復前後，更是第一個地實學會的年會，因爲從前日本也未在此開過如此的大會。現在一時聚集了地質工作者八十餘人，其中有的還是遠從北平，蘭州，廣州趕來的。論文的題目，包括地質學的各科，硏究的對象遍佈全國各省，這眞是島上所得未曾有的學術性的感會！</p>
<p>中國地質學會這回之所以選定台灣爲年會地點，自有其特殊意義：爲明瞭遺並非僅屬觀光性質的特殊意義之所在，我們應先了解一些台島與中國大陸在地質上的特點。在中國犬陸上所保存着的地史的記錄極爲豐富，也相當完備：從最古老的先寒武紀起，以迄中生代的初期，不知多少次的海陸變遷，滄桑輿發都歷歷可辦。惟自中生代中期起，大陸地殼即漸趨穩固，神洲永不陸沉：其後各個時期雖亦各有發育亦甚完美的地層為其代表，但終無大規模的海相沉積，尤其是到了更後的新生代，僅有代表盆地的比較淺薄的紅色岩層。但在這在中國大陸的沉積史上漸趨式微的時期，歐亞大陸的南緣郤正進行着一次最大的沉積作用。這一地帶西起南歐，中經小亞細亞，伊朗，印度，緬甸，南洋羣島，以東迄台灣，從中孕育了今日聳峙在這一地帶上的巍峨偉麗的阿爾卑斯，喜馬拉亞及合灣山脈。經由台灣的光復，中國地史也終於因收回了這曾經失去的精彩的一頁而補全了！我們軍新有了第三紀的海相地層，這些地層還帮着煤與石油一齊歸還祖國。眞的，對於歷經八年苦戰而終能還我河山，中國的地質學者在四萬萬同胞中是有加倍的悲喜交集之情的！他們這回在台灣開會就是爲了要趕着一讀這重歸版籍的大塊文章，所以聞訊而集者多至數十人，皆以先覩爲快。他們要去訪問的地點與一般來台　光者在日程上所排列的逈不相同：這正可說明他們的來意。</p>
<p>除了地层的沉積外，台灣在地體構造上亦居世界上第一等重要的地位；從縱的方向言，它是琉球弧與吕宋弧問的連鎖；從橫的方向言，它是最大的大陸與最大的大洋間的臨界；更綜合縱橫兩項言之，它是世界上以地震與火山作用之集中而表現其特點的兩大構造帶（壊太平洋帶與地中海帶）的接合處。這種「戰略」地位已使台灣在世界地體構造上成爲一個「要塞」，身臨其境，眞覺得每一細微之處都有其深刻的義意；則單爲了遺個，也値得地質學者們不遠千里而來。至於台島的本身，構造亦極繁複；從大地槽的深處席捲而來的大規模的倒轉　　與逆掩斷層實與見於在構造地質學上爲聖地勝境之阿爾卑斯山者同一型式，這些也是在以基底褶縐爲大構造之主要型式的中國大陸上所不易見到的。此外，台灣尙有若干種地下資源，對其價値之估計，地質學者在國人中當然倍屬關心。所以在短短的時日中，他們不惜爲苗栗油田及金瓜石礦山兩處各費去兩日的行程。</p>
<p>台灣光復已滿二年，二中來過的人眞也不少；他們在帮助久別後的台灣同胞重新認識祖國上究竟已做了多少，我們誠不敢說。因此，這回中國地質學會來台的會員在無形中還另有一種很大的實任，這種責任我們相信他們是一定能以新人耳自的表現與移人觀感的事實去完成的。（十一月十五日於台灣地質調査所）</p>

<h3>開放自由外匯尙非其時　平衡會傳將改組　切合實際致力於平「準」工作</h3>
<p>〔本報南京十七日電〕前傳外匯平衡基金委會有裁撤說，有關方而對此未予承認。惟據財政界訊，外匯平衡基金委會將改組爲外匯平準委會。蓋平衡基金委會成立以來，其所持有「基金」，實不足以達成平衡作用。主持其事者，曾一再建議，予以改組，經多次硏討，始作此一決定。</p>
<p>〔中央社本巿訊〕關於謠傳外匯平衡基金委員會撤銷一事，記者十七日特走訪有關常局，據談未有所聞，目前外匯平衡政策，悉照原定計劃進行。並無任何變更云。</p>
<p>〔又訊〕一度又起波動之金融及物價，因當局措置得宜，以靜制動之結果，日來已趨平穩。但昨日又盛傳財政三要人將於日內聯袂出國赴美，但據探詢之結果，均表示未有所聞。</p>
<p>〔聯合徽信所訊〕頃據中央銀行業務局長兼外匯平衡會委員沈熙瑞談，外傳外匯平衡基金委員會行將撤銷，但南京方面已證明此事不確。目前外匯平衡政策一切照原訂計劃進行，無任何變更。關於自由外匯之主張，沈氏認爲非根本之計。因實行自由外匯以後，是否爲供求關係，不再發生黑市，及出口是否可以如理想之好轉，均無法保設。目前一般人均好趨新，每一辦法實行以後，即覺不對，力主改革。改革以後，問題又來，始終不能滿意。余固贊成改變，自由外匯亦無不可，惟再改以後，是否適合需要，頗成問題。政府今日所希望者爲長期而澈底之圖，以期維持永久。自由應有條件，有限度，非如無韁之馬，任其奔馳。</p>
<h3>突然開放影響更大</h3>
<p>〔中經社訊〕近日各界盛傳政府將考慮有條件之開放自由外匯事，昨據本市經濟金融界權威人士談稱，此係一般商人之猜測，事實上外匯之在今日，管制仍較開放爲佳。目前外匯之市價與香港之牌價相差甚多，若突然開放自由外匯，外匯價格一躍而高升甚多，此足以刺激物價，影響民生。在管制下之外匯，人民明知私自經營買賣外匯係一件犯法之事，尙不敢明目張胆交易，反之，開放後交易之增多，自在意中。且開放自由外匯，與政治，社會，均有問題。應在安定之局面下開放，方不致有其他之影響，目前只能仍加以管制。但管制中，應確定幾項大項目，如鼓勵出口，爭取僑匯等，由政府予以變通之辦法，使其有合理之成交，以平衡外匯收支云。</p>
<h3>外匯管制即使取消進出口業並不樂觀</h3>
<p>關於改變外匯管制政策，取消目前之外匯市價及平衡基金會，改爲外匯自由貿易政策一點，近日市上傳之甚盛。雖經有關各方屢加否認，然昨日市上對此傳說更熾。神州社記者特分訪與此有切身關係之進出口業鉅子，綜合意見如下：　現行之外匯管制政策，不僅不能消滅黑巿，且相反因黑巿與市價之相差懸殊南致僑匯逃避，出口困難，故確有改善之必要。　價如由目前之管制政策而即行改爲外匯自由貿易政策，其後果必然激起出口物資及外匯之更形狂漲，以致引起普遍物價之上昇，僑匯或可因此而得少數之回籠，出口業仍將陷於更高之困境。　爲政府平衡外匯基金，及便活潑整個進出口之業務，同時爲消滅外匯黑市起見，惟有實行進出口迎鎖制。政府在不供給外匯之原則下，以出口平衡進口之外匯，同時更可由政府規定在出口外匯中提出若干成以供進口之用，餘數可由政府按市價收購，如此則政府之外匯基金可逐漸得到充裕，而民問之進出口業務更可加情活躍。至黑市外匪因其需要减少，亦可目形消滅。</p>
<h3>統債回低外股盤高</h3>
<p>公債昨吿回低，統丙晨開二二〇〇〇元，三六〇室賣到二一三〇〇元，六二八室乘低有買而後稍定。結果較上週六計甲乙跌六〇〇元，統丙降二〇〇元，統丁跌九〇〇元，統戊落五〇〇元，成交約五百萬。</p>
<p>外股昨買風擴大，擁資者乘各公司整頓內部之際，迭次爭購，怡紗自晨初二四八〇〇〇元起，盤高至二八五〇〇〇元以上結束。港申電縮至五元有零，錢兌帮散多有出，廣帮洋行帮則進，結果較上週六計怡紗紙版祥泰各昂二成，航業英聯墾植漲成半，怡啤鋼業電車電話業廣升一成，會德豐好起半成。</p>
<h3>華股買氣旺盛美亞等吿漲停</h3>
<p>華股昨先受外股刺激，繼之减抵證金傳說又起，買風逐步擴大，美亞所漲更多，雜股永業景綸中紡五和以及閘北均吿漲停。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>升沉不一，永紗自即交二九七元，遞交三〇三元開後，曾降至即交二九二元，遞交二九四元低價。其後遂漸盤好，外股俏利非凡，證金傳說又起，竟步漲到即交三一三元，遞交三一八地高價。雖曾回落七八元，終以分別再吸現遞者多，午收爲三〇八元及三一二元，收後喊低少許。美亞所漲較多，餘者不過穩健而已。結果較上週六即交股計美亞獨昂半成，永紗華新闡北信和華豐新光景福中法信誼內衣中絲大通統益中紡榮豐均吿微升，勤興新亞新華火柴小挫，景綸永公尙平。遞交股計美亞漲半成，勤興尙平外，餘成微升。</p>
<p>後市</p>
<p>初時見好，但以逢高有供給，現遞永紗均退至三〇八元，國行交換雖有差進，仍拉高至三二〇元及三二四元光景，而回低五六元。美亞即交永業閘北均掛漲停，景綸五和中紡在混亂中亦迫漲限收市。信和上升亦速，迨永紗漲到即交三二八元，遞交三三〇元高價後，因有力售，而後以三二七元及三二九元之價收市。結果較晨收計即交股美亞中紡景綸五和永業漲停，閘北漲停後小回，軋漲成半。勤興升一成，永紗信和華新新光景福華豐火柴內衣各漲半成，信誼平平，餘成微升。遞交股計動興好一成，餘均漲半成。場外各老股大生及文化股公用股再好少許，銀行股漲漲半成。</p>
<p>華商證券改營別業</p>

<h3>食米上落微細</h3>
<p>昨日南北兩市共到米糧二萬三千五百餘石，店方納胃動而不旺，市况上落有限，波動甚微。南市初疲後堅，北市先挺後懈，結局粳米早薄稻蘇嘉綫南路白粳均呈疲勢，略見修削三五千元。秈米則少變化，無榮無辱。自陰元亦少呼吸。</p>
<p>麵粉另化尙股，微挺一二千元，麩皮亦升一二千元。豆餅汕頭去胃轉懈，回挫亡一千元。黃豆客帮續有問灣，油廠揀巧拾取，隴海來源不弱，市勢早疲午挺，實乏軒輊。</p>
<p>菉豆南洋去化活躍，猛漲二三萬元。豇豆汕頭搜羅甚食，繼續飛奔三四萬元。赤豆廣帮動辦，突漲二三萬元。蠶豆另化有動，挺升三五千元。生仁廣方轉懈，止漲轉跌，挫落二三萬元。</p>
<p>芝蔴油廠冷淡，本街吸胃尙濃，高貨見挺萬元，中次平平。紅糧北洋不動，酒坊去路甚淡，回低三五千元。苞米靑鳥有動，市面俏俐，盤漲一二萬元。</p>
<p>油市因蘇北續到，隴海來貨接連，人心不振，豆油見疲一二萬元，生油修削萬元，菜油平平，蔴油疲乏，淸油亦短萬元。</p>
<h3>中信將恢復配售人絲　昨辦理織廠登記　市况平中帶穩廠經稍軟</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中信局人造絲，前因日本易貨未到，暫停配售。茲悉：昨日已有人造絲二千箱以上，從日本起運來滬，中信局即擬恢復配售，昨日起開始辦理絲織廠登記。</p>
<p>社局審査織廠名册</p>
<p>社會局對中央信託局所配售本巿各絲繼廠之人造絲方法，極表不滿，因需要之工廠，其所配之數并不敷其需要，有一部份配額較多者，則本身并不實際製造，致發生流入黑市之現象，以致人造絲中央信託局迄未配售，正在硏究改善方法。日前中央信託局已將上項配售出廠名册，送往社會局審核，經社會局審核後，認爲有若干工廠所列生產設備等項有不正確，刻仍在繼續審核中。惟社會局仍希望中央信託局派員實際調査云。</p>
<p>又訊：人造絲昨日上午頗形平穩，開盤雖軟，收盤價已與上週末相仿。下午因股市見高，人心爲之激揚，最後價比上週末高三百萬元，一二〇號旭字有光上午二百萬元開盤，收盤即期三百萬元，隔日期四百萬元。下午最後價爲七百萬元，四A東洋已叩近九千萬元。</p>
<p>廠絲</p>
<p>昨巿稍呈疲軟，五担頭有單子貨喊價雖無變化，根本毫無成交。高另担做開六千七百萬元，中另担做開六千六百萬元，俱比上過末下挫一百萬元之譜。干經因土絲貨地升揚，申市乃告堅昂，特上另担價仍在五千萬元左右。</p>
<p>綢貨</p>
<p>昨巿堅穩，大誠與華强眞絲被面，開巿四百五十萬元有成交，旋因空方乘低進補，行情即吿上升，最高做五百十萬元即期價，後退至四百九十萬元即期，五百萬元隔日期之間盤旋。收市時做即期四百八十五萬元，今日期九十五萬元。美亞貨即期五百十萬元左右，成交甚稀。其他各貨廠盤，大致未動，華錦縐六萬元，民生花綈七萬二千元，林記蠟羽紗六萬八千元，湖貨大偉呢因土絲高昂，成本激增，故每碼申市價，高達十三四萬元左右。</p>
<h3>銀根轉緊</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日因有大批食糖結款，致銀根轉緊，業外尤甚。四行兩局差入二五五億，國行差入一六九億，大交換行莊差入一八八億，洋商銀行差入二〇七億，小交換行莊差出七五〇億，中行差出一八六億，交通差入五〇億，中農差出三六億，中信局差入一一五億，郵匯局差入一四九億，合作金庫差出六億。</p>

<h3>棉紗議價未變動　紗布起伏狹隘現棉平穩</h3>
<p>紡調會棉紗議價，昨日並未更變，黑市行情業已變定。中紡公司代理配售處，昨日配出各支棉紗頗多，價仍與上週五相同，均配予各複製品廠商，致乙級（紗號）販賣商，現仍暫不配售。</p>
<p>棉紗</p>
<p>昨日棉紗市况，以紡建公司開售價與上期相彷，初開人心堅挺，本街與客帮略有需吸，行情步昂。旋因銀根趨緊，進戶轉稀，且有散戶吐售，市微下挫。結果四十二支藍鳳細紗比週六回漲卅萬，爲三千九百八十萬元。廿支雙馬紗亦好卅萬，十六支光明升四十萬，其他各支粗細紗，互有三，五十萬元之升沉云。</p>
<p>布疋</p>
<p>棉布市况晨開時買戶觀望，喊價曾見疲軟，至十時後，各方見低力進，染廠搜吸白坯細布甚夥，是以十二磅龍頭等各檔細布，較之週六回升一·之萬至三萬五千元。嗶嘰元直貢因紛建供額頗多，行情下挫一至四萬，士林布高檔挺秀四·五萬，其他各布市氣亦趨堅挺。</p>
<p>現棉</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况平靜，易交供求平衡，價格與週六相仿，無甚差別。紗廠進意甚濃，貨主逢高脫手，全日交易均爲紗廠收進，同業對做甚少。各檔成交一七六〇包，二百担，送廠價做開靈寳四三一萬五千，沙市四二三萬三千，山東四二九萬，三餘鎭三九二萬七千，通州三四七萬二千，漢口細絨三九二萬七千，成交一三〇〇包二百祖。棧交價靈賽四三〇萬，彰德三九七萬六千，啓東三五五萬五千，漢細三九六萬八千，通州三三七萬三千，成交四六包，周浦籽花七一萬。</p>
<h3>代紡外棉工繳　暫照八月份計算</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第二季代紡外棉總數十萬包，約可紡紗十二萬件，定十一，十二兩個月內分六期繳淸，代紡工繳仍暫照八月份三百八十萬元計算，前所有第一季代紡外棉，本埠已大部繳情，外埠亦正催繳中。</p>
<p>又訊：全國經濟委員會，定廿日在京開會，將討論棉紗聯合配銷事宜。</p>
<p>厚呢暢銷</p>
<p>厚貨大衣呢，平厚呢麥而登’厚嗶嘰厚花呢等，刻均及時暢銷，本客帮續有需要。大批發戶逐日有相當開出，茶會上直接間接成交甚夥，平厚呢與麥而登，以藏靑色爲暢銷，大衣呢灰色爲活躍，長毛羢廠靑爲居俏薄呢盛行棕色，厚呢棕色滯銷，每碼雖賤十萬元，亦乏受主。</p>
<h3>內銷茶穩俏</h3>
<p>紅綠茶自執主售意頻轉堅化以來，市上供應寥落，而外銷茶，出口商之胃納本極細微，且尙圖低價吸取，是以過程頗趨相互擯持之局，市氣岑靜少變。他若內銷花色，仍因本街店莊等地之去化相接，致買戶猶在力搜中，然情勢則續形穩俏。</p>
<p>法屬北菲購我綠茶</p>
<p>據茶業方面消息：昨日成交綠茶九百五十噸，價格爲每公斤美金九角，此係田法國經濟使節團接洽成交輸往北匪者，此當爲最近綠茶輪出之一　巨額，惟明日即須裝運出口，故承接此項交易之茶商，莫不漏夜配裝，　見忙碌。</p>
<p>又據茶業界人士稱我國綠茶品質良好，祗須以科學方法在技術上予以改進，外銷並非無望。惟年來國際市塲跌價，及國內人士增漲，爲茶葉出口之一大困難。</p>
<h3>台糖續緊</h3>
<p>昨糖市以台糖公司又有調整配價之說，人心較佳。赤白台糖俱見續緊，惟靑糖去化甚呆，依然平平。公會劃盤，二四粗白棧單一百〇六萬五千元，二〇中砂白棧單九十九萬元，聞下午非正式交易，復有略升。土糖開出汕提靑八十二萬元，次之八十萬〇五千元，計三百包之譜。興化白高袋裝一百〇一二萬，　裝九十七八萬元，興赤九十一二萬元，計四百餘件。刁靑開　十包，仍爲七十八萬元。</p>

<h3>貓的天堂</h3>
<p>— E左拉著　畢修勺譯</p>
<p>一個姑母去世之後，留給我一隻安哥拉貓，這是我所認識的最蠢笨的畜牲。看，以下就是冬季的一晚，牠在熱的爐火前面述給我聽的故事。</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>那時我已兩歲，我的確是人們所能看見的最肥胖最天眞的一隻貓。在道樣輕的年紀，我還有一般動物不屑享受爐火暖和的自負。至於，我多麽應該感謝老天把我安置在您姑母的家裏呀！勇敢的女人很愛我。我在衣橱的深處，有一間眞正的臥房，一個羽毛的坐整。食物也與睡房一樣的舒服；從來不用麵包或羹湯，給我吃的只是肉，還流着血的好肉。</p>
<p>可是，在這些溫柔中問，我只有一個願望，一個夢想，就是溜出半開的窗口，然後逃到屋頂上去。撫摩對我好像是太乏味了，床的柔軟簡直使我作嘔，我這樣肥胖，連我自己也厭惡起來。我長日幸福地活着，終於使我煩悶了。</p>
<p>我應該對您說，伸出頭頸，我就從窗口看見對面的屋頂。那一天恰有四隻貓在相鬥，全身的毛倒豎着，尾巴高高地，牠們以快樂的叫聳，在晒着太陽光的靑石瓦上打滾。從來，我沒有看到過這樣希奇的景象。從此，我的信仰已經確定了。眞正的幸福是在屋項上，是在人們如此小心地關閉着的窗戶的外面。使我確信的證據是：人們總是這樣關閉着裏面藏有鮮肉的櫉門。</p>
<p>我決定逃走的計劃。在生活中，除滴着血的鮮肉之外，一定還有別的東西。這就是「未知」，就是理想。一日，人們忘記推關廚房的窗戶，我就跳到下面的小屋頂上。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>屋項是多麽美麗呀！電的承　，裝在牠們的邊緣，發出甜美的香味。我愉快地循着這些承雷前進，我的脚沒在細軟的，有着無限溫柔的污泥中。我好像在絨毛上面行走似的。太陽散下那樣好的熱氣，簡直使我身上的脂防都要融解了。</p>
<p>我不瞞您說，我的四肢都在顫抖。我的快樂中混着恐怖。我尤其是記得一種可怕的感動，幾乎使我跌到街上去。三隻在屋脊上打滾的貓可怕地叫着，跑到我的身邊來。看我要香暈的時侯，他們即罵我是蠢胖子，牠們對我說，他們是叫着玩的。我也開始跟牠們一樣喵喵地叫起來。這是很有趣的。那是活潑的畜牲沒有我的蠢笨的脂肪。常我如脂球一樣在陽光晒熱的鉛板上滑動的時候，他們譏笑我的笨重。其中的一隻老雄貓特別向我表示好感。他自動地願意替我効勞牠担負我的敎育的責任，這，我是很感激地接受的。</p>
<p>啊！您姑母的寵愛已經離遠了！我在承雷中飲水，從來放糖的牛奶，在我看來，都沒有這樣甜美。一切對我都像是很好很善。一隻雌貓，一隻悅耳的，她的漂亮容藐使我充滿是前所未有之感動的雌貓出現了。直至那時，只有我的夢想對我指出這些芙妙的生物有着可愛柔軟的脊梁。我的三個同伴與我，我們跑去迎接她。在牠們的前面，我想先向可愛的雌貓表示我的歡迎，不料，我的一個同伴惡狠地咬着我的頭頸。我即發出苦痛的叫聲。</p>
<p>「算了吧！」老雄貓拖我走的時候說，「您將看見許多別的雌貓。」</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>散步了一小時之後，我就覺得很想吃東西。</p>
<p>「在屋頂上究竟吃些什麽？」我問我的朋友，老雄貓。</p>
<p>「吃些我們所能找到的東西，」牠學究似的回答。</p>
<p>這回答使我有點茫然，因爲我徒然尋找，始終找不到一點東西。最後，我醫見樓頂房裏有一個靑年女工在準備她的午飯。窗下的桌上，放着一塊使我垂涎的，血紅的好肋肉。</p>
<p>「看，我的事情解決了」，我非常天眞地想道。</p>
<p>我就跳到桌上，我哎起那塊肋肉。可是女工看見我了，用掃帶柄在我的背脊上可怕地打了一下。我放了肋肉並發出可怖的呼聲逃走了。</p>
<p>「那末」您是從鄉下出來的吧！」老雄貓對我說。「放在桌上的肉不是給我們吃的，我們只可以遠遠地想着他。我們要在承雪裏尋找我們的食品」。</p>
<p>我永遠不能了解廚房的肉不屬於貓的道理。我的肚已開始認眞地發氣了。老雄貓對我說必須等到夜裏，這終於使我大失所望。一到夜裏，我們就可跳到街上，搜索各處的垃圾堆。等到夜裏！牠如老練的哲學家似的，平靜地說出這個！我呢，我一想到這延長的斷食，我就覺得自己要昏暈了，</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>夜慢慢地來了，這是使我寒冷的發霧之夜。不久，又下雨了，雨點細細的，蝕骨的，被急驟的大風吹着。我們由一條樓梯的玻璃窗口下去。在我看來，街道是多廢醜陋！這已不是這溫暖的熱氣，這大的太陽，這光明的，大家可以如此愉快打滾的白屋頂了。我的脚在汚濕的石街上滑溜。我苦惱地憶起我的三層臥被與我的羽毛墊子。</p>
<p>我們剛到街上，我的朋友，老雄貓就開始顫抖。牠縮得很小很小，牠陰險地沿着房屋奔跑，並要我趕快跟着他走。待牠遇到一個可通馬車的大門，牠就很迅速地隱在那裏，並吐出了滿足的喉聲。待我問牠爲何這樣逃走的理由時，牠就回答我：</p>
<p>「您看見背上有籃與手裏拿着一根小鈎的那個人麽？」</p>
<p>「看見的。」</p>
<p>「那末—如果他看見我們，他就會打死我們並把我們放在鐵棒上烤吃了！」</p>
<p>「放在鐵棒上烤吃了！」我喊着說。「那末，街道也不屬於我們麼？我們非但沒有吃的，而反要被人吃掉麽？」</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>然而人們把垃圾倒在門前。我失望地搜索這些汚物堆。我遇見兩三塊瘦骨泥在齷齪的灰燼中。從此，我懂得牛羊的鮮肺是多麽有味！我的朋友，老雄貓以藝術家的姿態爬掃垃圾。他使我直奔跑到早晨，牠毫不着急地訪問每一街道。差不多在十小時之內，我受着雨的打擊，我的全體都顫抖了。可詛咒的街道；可詛咒的自由！我是多麽惋惜我的監獄呀！</p>
<p>天亮之後，老雄貓看見我在蹣躇，即以奇怪的態度問我：</p>
<p>「您已够受了麽？」</p>
<p>「哦！是的，」我回答。</p>
<p>「您願意回到您的家喪去麽？」</p>
<p>「當然，不過，怎樣能回去呢？」</p>
<p>「您來吧。昨天上午，當我看見您出來的時候，我就知道如您這樣胖的一隻貓，不是生來爲享受自由的辛辣快樂的。我認識您的住宅，我帶您到您的門口吧。」</p>
<p>這可敬的老雄貓，就這樣簡單地對我說了。待我們走到的時候：</p>
<p>「永別了」他毫不顯露感動地向我吿別。</p>
<p>「不」我喊着說，「我們不能就這樣離開。您跟我一起來。我們將平分我的同一張床與同一塊肉。我的女主人是個好女人………」</p>
<p>牠不讓我說完。</p>
<p>「請閉尊口吧！」牠突然說，：「您是一個傻瓜。我會死在您的溫柔中。您的豐盛的生活對於新生的貓，的確是很好的。自由的貓是永不以監獄的代價，購買您的肺腑鮮肉與您的羽毛墊子……永別了。」</p>
<p>牠再跳到牠的屋頂上去。我看牠的大而瘦的側影，遇着初昇太陽的撫摩，在發着舒適的戰慄。</p>
<p>待我回家之後，您的姑母拿起塵拂，重重地韃打我，而我也很快樂地接受這應有的懲戒。我舒服地嘗着這溫暖與被打的愉快，當她鞭我的時候，我甜美地想着她將拾我吞嚼的鮮肉。</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>「您看」，我的猫作結論似的說，並把牠的身體伸向炭火的前面，「眞正的幸福，—天堂，我親愛的主人，是被關在一間有肉的房子裏，即時被打，也是快樂的。」</p>
<p>我是替猫說話。</p>
<h3>黃泛區寫生</h3>
<p>— 李丁隴</p>
<h3>觀丁隴巨畫記</h3>
<p>— 鑄九</p>
<p>最近我赴美術茶會，不期遇見李君丁隴，十年亂離，一旦重聚，中心感慰，不可言兪。及見李君帶來許多畫，不禁使我驚奇。他在十年中能一本藝術志趣，奮發努力，跋涉道送，艱辛備嘗，從而得到出人意外的收穫與成就，實非偶然倖致。因此特將其得意的巨大製作，介紹於同好之前。</p>
<p>（一）千乘萬騎圖：計長十餘丈是一個極複雜的塲面，李君費時一年，將邊胞番子哈薩兄蒙古人，旗人，藏人，維吾爾等十餘種的人民生活情形，及賽馬的尙武精神，用暢達熟練的手法，盡情描寫無遺；至其取材的眞切，稱圖的新穎，又顯出其匠心獨運。</p>
<p>（二）贛江行跡圖：長約七丈，這是作者行經山川奇險，與世途荆棘，一一蘊於胸中，寄以深慨，而後發之於毫端，潑之於素褚，其所表演似有澄淸濁世之念存乎其問。</p>
<p>（三）黃泛圖：此剛的全面積有二百六十餘尺，計長十餘丈，當二十七年黃河決口時李君乃不避艱險親赴泛區寫生。這樣的描寫水災巨作與鄉俠的流民圖同其價値。</p>
<p>（四）極樂世界圖：此圖而積有四百餘平方尺，這是李君用九個月的功夫專臨摹敦煌千佛洞隋唐壁畫，而其組織章法乃出於作者自己的設想。</p>
<p>（五）鳳儀圖：這是李君寫生各種不同的鳥類組織的，殊見別致全面積亦有二百餘平方尺之巨。</p>
<h3>一寸山河一寸白</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>我想起了這個神秘口笛，便問耀羣，是否拿這種口笛透送警報？</p>
<p>「您猜着了一小半。」耀羣這回笑出了聲；大約看見我的神情，過分驚奇緊張，覺得可笑。</p>
<p>「一小牛？」我頓時發生了研究的興趣。</p>
<p>「共實也不是什麽了不起的新發明；」耀羣漸漸收了笑容；「與其說是新發明，還不如說是「復古」…可惜沒有時間多說，他們也許就要來了，…</p>
<p>「沒關係，大不了…」我有些迫不及待，表示願意耀羣把這東西說明一下，哪怕很簡單的說兩句。</p>
<p>耀羣看見我對這傳訊方式的如此急切，便問着我：「您知道咱們有一種近乎失傳的發聲方式？」</p>
<p>「一時倒想不起來。」我在枯腸中處量搜索了一回。</p>
<p>「嘯：您知道？」耀羣問着我。沒等我回答，她繼續說了起來。</p>
<p>原來關外老察裏那位古董單師，他原有一肚子的三敎九流（前文已經提到過）。就是這位老古董，把「嘯」的十多種發聲方式傳給了耀羣。至於鉀羣吸收下的新舊知識，也頗不少，由她把那短普波的原理，與一種嘯法，叫作什麽「小沉」的方式參和起來。</p>
<p>「小沉」這個方式，據嘯譜上說：「用舌外激，遏其氣，使之上揚；…因共屬陰，故發聲如鬼音，如龍吟，…態遙愈激…」</p>
<p>「其實很簡單」，耀羣瞧着有些不明瞭，便又加上些註解：「京劇的好角兕，擅長用「腦後昔」，這個您大槪知道？所謂腦後音，就是近聽不　，愈還愈瞭亮的一種聲音…「小沉」的嘯法也是如此…」</p>
<p>「可是方才小老虎驚得跳起來的時候，我並沒有聽見什麼聲響…」我仍舊沒有明白這種神秘傳聲的道理。</p>
<p>「好處就在這一點上。」耀羣嘴角上的兩隻小園渦，道時重復現了出來，表示了這麽一絲絲得意的神情：「可是煩難的也在這一點上。…」</p>
<p>耀羣說到這裏，頓了一頓，似乎正在推想，用什麽言語和方式，才可把這神秘傳聲的玩意兒說得簡潔明白：「您知道，短波口笛的長處，就在叫人類耳波，感不到知覺，換句話，就是叫人總不見，無論是在近身邊或在遠處。道一點您是明瞭的。？…」</p>
<p>這一點我當然明瞭，所以點了點頭，作爲表示，害怕一發聲說話，又把耀羣的思路岔到旁的題目上去了。</p>
<p>「相反的」，耀羣也點了點頭，反應了我的答覆：「嘯的發聲，無論遠近，都可聽到；不過近邊降輕，而愈遠愈激楊。這一點您大槪也明瞭了？」耀羣重又一頓，意思要給我一個理會的時間；同時也要取得我的答覆。</p>

<h3>婚姻行</h3>
<p>— 孫約翰</p>
<p>猛如虎，急如潮；一片喧囂過畫橋。朱顏笑展櫻桃口，碧玉輕掀楊柳腰。中有一人橋畔坐，血流滿地頭顱破。齒牙擊落不成言，十月單存犢鼻褲。迴身根觸臨江渚，路人接耳爲予叙；此係豪門姑老爺，妻房失寵無歸庭。當年意氣盛如雲，革履洋裝灑出羣。揮霍輝將金比土，用情顛倒石榴裙。絹閣紅樓邂逅時，道旁翠柳亂成絲。縱敎半面纔窺得覺累書生徹夜思。小姑居處正無侶，閒愁幽怨憑誰語？才逗媚波目已成，未通鶯語心先許，花燭高燒閙洞房，含情低口喚搜郞。美蓉較暖尤雲膩，豈義香溫　雨涼。比目雙飛進理枝，同心共命合歡辭；　　蝶般鴛鴦夢，我我卿卿鸚鵡詩。詎知美事多磨折，往日風流融冰雪。一病翻成太瘦生。百年從此傷離別。病餘憔悴更奇貧，欲向乾坤了此身。夫婦相逢渾陌路，餐風宿露可憐人。沿街匍匐苦黃昏，舉目凄凉獨斷魂。力盡精殫簷下立，銅鐵鐵尺出重門。我聞此事三長嘆，婚姻大抵如買賣。有奶可親方是娘；無錢滾你媽的蛋！</p>
<p>自由談</p>
<h3>靑廉的大臣　—反貪汚的陸宣公</h3>
<p>— 唐汕</p>
<p>我國歷代朝臣，像蔡京，秦檜之流，　着權貴與地位，貪贓枉法的固多，但淸廉自好的也不乏人。這等耿介潔身的官吏，金銀珠竇動不得他，寵優恩賜也不能轉動他堅貞的意志。對上奉公守法，對下秋毫無犯。</p>
<p>唐代陸　（陸宣公），官至翰林學士，甚見親任。德宗皇帝知道他淸貧自愛，會降了一道密旨，示意他不妨撈點油水。那位送密旨的欽差對他說道：「皇上知道你太淸廉嘆慣，各道奉送你的東西，你二拒絕，如果你大宗的財物不受，像鞭鞾這一類收納一些也無妨。」陸賢不但「未敢奉詔，」反嚴詞凜凜的奏了一通，說「陛下慮事之不通，有乖理道。」公在「謝密旨因論所宣事狀」中奏陳：</p>
<p>「夫胥吏末流，苞苴微脫，茍或違道，臣猶知漸；况乎公卿大臣之問，方岳連帥之任，豈資賄納，然後致誠？若因財利交歡，是以姑息百事，旣乖直道，必有過求；遂之則法度浸墮，阻之則觖望彌甚，爲害如此，國何賴焉？……凡上之所爲，以導下也；上所不爲，以檢下也。上所不爲而下爲之，然後可以設峻防，直明辟；若上爲之，而下亦爲之，固其理也，又可禁乎？……若大臣邇臣可以受財，則麻長案寮孰爲不可？朝廷取之於方鎭，方鎭取之於州，州取之於縣，縣取之於鄉，鄉將安取哉？賄道一開，輾轉滋甚，鞭　不已，必及衣裘；衣裘不已，必及幣帛；幣帛不已，必及車輿；車輿不已，必及金璧。日見可欲，何能自室於心；已與私交，固難決絕其意。是以沿流不止，谿望成災；毫末旣差，邱山聚釁，自昔國家敗亡多矣？</p>
<p>我願節抄了這大段奏議，覺得這句句老實話，直是今世的貪官汚吏當頭檄文。官吏貪贓枉法，固不足取，就是受民饋獻，也値得考慮。今日的大官到一處受一處的禮品，實在還是變相的貪汚，因爲這作用不是媚上便是褶於威儀。作父母官，受政府俸，權利已俱；若謂「鞭樺」不妨收納，則「金璧」亦必至不拒了。眞正的淸風亮節，必須毫末無取於非份的。</p>
<h3>談鶴</h3>
<p>— 廣益</p>
<p>鶴的種類很多，最難得可貴的是丹頂鶴，全身羽毛純白，頭部有一撮紅毛，高有三尺多，嘴和頭都長，喜歡喫魚，翼大飛速，嗚聲高朗，詩經：「鶴嗚於九皋，聲聞於天」，說明鶴的嗚聲洪亮。產於東三省及西伯利亞等處，到冬天便遷移到溫帶地方，春天仍歸舊土，所以鶴是一種候烏。</p>
<p>最近（十月二日）廣東順德大良鄉鄉人捕得丹頂鶴一隻，可惜已受傷死了，足部緊有小鉅牌一塊，上　「大明洪武放生」等字，字跡已很糢糊，細辨始可略識。推算這隻鶴的年齡已經五百八十多歲了。陸機詩疏。「鶴壽千歲」，我們人類的生命披多不過百歲，究竟鶴的壽命是不是能活到千歲以上，也無法武斷確定；不過從這隻鶴證明已活了五百八十多年，可說是長壽的了。今人祝夀都稱鶴算，也有很多人喜歡以鶴題名，例如「鶴年」「鶴齡一等，無非是希望和鶴同樣的長夀。</p>
<p>我喜歡鶴，我喜歐鶴的淸遠閒放，我更喜歡牠的純潔超乎產埃之外，所以有人把鶴比喩作賢人君子隱德之士。當牠終日逍遙在靑山綠水問，或則翩翔在藍天雲空，或則立在山邊的水田裏啄食，何等的悠開自得！同時我要爲囚在動物固裏樊籠中失去自由的鶴悲哀。至於在順德被捕的那隻鶴，因傷致死更是不幸，焚琴煮鶴，未免太煞風景而有傷大雅了。本來「梅妻鶴子」的雅事，已是很久的過去的美談，何况在這動亂的年頭，誰也沒有這種閑情逸致了。</p>

<h3>重要問題</h3>
<p>— 禾生</p>
<p>一個小孩，患牙痛很是利害，常使他夜問不能安睡，並且哭關聲着實擾得家中其他的人也覺煩心。他父親便決定帶他去看牙醫師將牙齒拔去。幾經勸誘，那孩子方才同意。牙齒師檢査後，見有五顆牙齒已經蛀壊，於是將牠們一一拔出。手術完畢後，那孩子覺得嘴裏非常異樣，並且很困惱，因爲他不能咀嚼食物了。牙醫師爲使其安心起見，便對他說不要緊的，牙鹵會再生出。來的。小孩子聽說。禾，便趕緊問道：「生。在吃飯之前牠們來得及長出來麽？」</p>
<h3>紫金山下殺人魔</h3>
<p>— 苞卿</p>
<p>在抗戰史上，南京大屠殺案，國人被害者達三十萬人以上，屍橫遍地，慘絕人實，震驚世界。尤以紫金山下兩惡魔作殺人比賽之事，駭人聽聞。大屠殺案主角谷壽夫，業於本年三月經我軍事法庭審竣後處決。而該兩殺人魔亦血債難逃，經我向遠東軍事法庭要求引渡，終於日前由日隨和順輪之返回而押解來華。將在國防部南京軍事法庭公審。</p>
<p>兩殺人魔各向井敏明及野田岩，其時均爲片桐部隊的少尉軍官，在句容作戰，舉行殺人比賽，言定在完全佔領南京以前，能親手殺死一百人者奪得錦標。其後在句容城外作戰時，向井已殺死八十九人，野田已殺死七十八人。迨至在紫金山下兩人晤面時，向井已殺死一百〇六人，野田已殺死一百〇五人，但不能決定誰先殺死一百人，於是兩人同意不以一百人爲標準，而以一百五十人爲標準，繼續比賽。此時，向井的軍刀，已因殺人太殘酷用力而有缺口。</p>
<p>向井十足是一個日本武士道型的黷武軍人，他說這競賽全是「玩意兒」，彼此能突破紀錄而互不相知是很有趣味的。且說，他把這軍刀擱在肩上時，子彈都不能打中他。這簡直是魔鬼在說話。</p>
<p>可是，日人不但不以道人爲殘酷不駭人道和漢視國際公法，反以武士道自豪。初由東京日日新聞特派戰地記者，以專電報道全國，日日新聞且刋出殺人魔的照片，在電訊前標以「紫金山下」的大標題。而日軍司令部不僅不注意蓋兩單紀，反更攝取殺人照片，炫耀武力。實爲縱兵肆虐，作有計劃的大規模屠殺，以圖摧殘我國抗戰精神與民族意識無疑。</p>
<h3>歸鄕去</h3>
<p>— 衡權</p>
<p>我離開故想已有十載多，住在都市裏住得風够討厭，都市的環境太惡劣，空氣太齷齪，生活太艱苦，使我一無留戀。</p>
<p>快歸家鄉去吧！靑山綠水，茅屋蓬戶，田問溪畔，瓜果蔬菜，多麼有趣，多麼新鮮！歌着陶老先生的歸去來辭吧！</p>
<p>日寇侵犯我境，家鄉淪陷，我與丈夫扶老携幼，逃難來滬，屈指計今，已有十年，這十年中，先以大女兒患心臟病，繼以老姑患盲腸炎，又以二女及三女同時咯血，余常年看護，至今未得安枕，尙有兩個男孩均在求學時期，余內心痛苦，誠非華墨所能盡述。</p>
<p>一家八口，均賴我夫一人心血換來的代價，際此生活高漲，又加病魔侵裴，令人徒喚奈何！</p>
<p>歸去吧！歸去吧！繁華的都市，非我窮人可居。</p>
<h3>雪茄烟的旅行</h3>
<p>— 鮑忠祈</p>
<p>一個德國行李僮替一個美國軍官背下旅行袋後，得到的報酬是一支美國雪茄，因爲這個軍官沒有德國的馬克。</p>
<p>以勞力換得食物的行李僮，就拿了這支雪茄，走到一家麵包店裏去，向店主掉了一隻麵包。</p>
<p>雪茄雖然高貴，可是麵包店主終於避免了它的誘惑，而把它當做修理那輛破爛的送貨汽車的代價。</p>
<p>修理修車的技師得到了那支雪茄，就把它易得一雙日夜所思的新鞋。</p>
<p>皮鞋推銷員把它在農夫家裏換了鷄蛋，送給他正在患病的兄弟。</p>
<p>最後，農夫很幸遝地燃起了那支雪茄，他是唯一能自給自足的人，也是極少數幸福的德國人中，能够享受雪茄的一個。</p>
<h3>影壇一週</h3>
<p>— 李箴</p>
<p>「幸福狂想曲」　上海，這冒險家的樂國，多少人從各個不同地方奔向而來，他們擁往於這滿地黃金的上海，結果上海全不是他們理想中的黃金滿地，而是充滿了欺詐，誘騙，醜惡的都市。「幸福狂想曲」是部表現上海的劇本，劇作者從劇中王金富，吳志海這一對小市民人物身上帶來了他們對於幸福的夢想，另一個張月華，那正是一個被生活壓爲了的女人，但他們都有着善良誠摯的熟情，因此他們不容於這罪惡的都市。在劇中作者寫出了另一個流氓人物姜世傑，他是代表了這社會上的黑暗勞力，在這流氓橫行的今天，要善良的人獲得生存，那必需等待一個對於社會眞正的改革。否則結尾時，他們三人跑到別處去，憑那一套投機的幸福狂想，結果必然是得到第二次失望。</p>
<p>在這題材難寫的今天，「幸福狂想曲」無疑地是部好劇本。導演陳鯉庭對戰的處理極爲恰當，處處抓緊了戲的發展，尤其格調的淸新，是他的一貫作風。</p>
<p>演出上，顧而已最佳，黃宗英，趙丹，演得極爲合適、黃的造型較佳，張冥可稱平穩。</p>
<p>此片錄音較差。</p>
<p>「思凡」　這一週中的西片，「思凡」是最好的一部。它描寫一羣天主敎貞女的生活，攝影　面的美麗，確爲最近英片中的佳作。演員以黛博拉蔻兒的貞女爲最佳，琪恩蘇蒙思的土女與大術德勒爾的弟恩也能令人滿意。</p>
<p>此片結尾時大雨滂沱中，男女主角互相道別。那一份惆悵的感情，正可見導演者的功力。</p>
<p>「蕩婦癡情」　這是部好萊塲定型的多角戀愛片子，由海蒂拉馬主演，故事頓爲平庸，演出上海蒂拉瑪尙佳，餘平，演珠寳商的約翰萊德頗爲不弱。</p>
<p>「南國春色」　以巴西南美風光爲背景，穿插了南美的音樂與歌唱作號召，故事是美國式的戀愛，這樣的片子，看多了一定感到厭膩。尤其演出上，簡陋而缺乏精彩。</p>
<p>「山谷英雄」　此片是描寫英雄美人的西部片，大羣馬匹在山等中飛馳，完全是粗鑛的作風，但是技巧上太陳舊了。似乎是過了時的作品。</p>
<h3>葉門王國素描</h3>
<p>— 高明</p>
<p>——她是聯合國的新會員</p>
<p>聯合國新會員葉門，坐落在數千年來爲海上要道的紅海的南端。她是以貿易爲首要的國家，但是在她的高原區域裏，仍保留着古代獨特的文化。</p>
<p>在七萬五千方里的國土上，居留着近五百萬的人口。他是阿拉伯最肥沃的區域，其實也是近東惟一有豐沛和定期的雨量的所在。</p>
<p>葉門現任的統治者是伊受葉耶，也就是葉門的國王。他爲葉門人民精神上和政治上的領袖，他斷言他是謨罕謨德女婿阿里的後裔。</p>
<p>在葉門，有一固二萬五千左右猶太人的區域，除了巴勒斯坦之外，這裏要算是最古老的猶太社會了。</p>
<p>伊曼葉耶的世系　續了有千餘年之久。自十六世紀開始，她在奧特曼帝國統治之下，原來的統治階級受到後者的更迭。直到第一次世界大戰，土耳其人被驅逐，現在的伊曼才恢復他那統治者的地位。一九三四年與英國訂約，確定她南部和亞丁的疆界；同年在另外一次條約中，又規定了她北部和沙地阿拉伯的界綫。葉門之東是荒脊的沙地沙漠，那裏她沒有明確的國境綫。</p>
<p>最近幾年巾，葉門在貿易和其他方面，和許多國家成立了協定。這些國家巾包括英國，美國·法國·蘇聯·埃及·比利時等。一九四五年她加入阿拉伯聯盟。</p>
<p>據說咖啡的發源是在葉門，幾百年來葉門輸出了不少佳種的咖啡，直到如今她南部的摩査是咖啡輸出的口岸。早在十七世紀那時，荷蘭東印度公司已在「摩查」設立了一個站口，從事咖啡的貿易，到了十入世紀，「摩査」這字，不管它的起源怎樣，在西歐被當作上等咖啡的同義詞。</p>
<p>咖啡，菓皮，葡萄乾爲集門輸往距離較遠國家的主要物品，榖類則輸向附近的鄰邦。她在食物方面是自給自是的。葉門著名的手工人是銀匠，鑄劍是他們的特長，作品聞名東方。</p>
<p>葉門沒有鐵路，但在重要的市鎭間有公路連緊着。這些公路經過逐漸的改良，現在汽車和駱駝商隊多能通過其上。</p>
<p>沙那是葉門的京城，有六萬人口，舖砌着齊整的街道，周圍有二十又高極厚的城牆，八個城門貫穿其間。</p>
<h3>退飛的島</h3>
<p>— 公孫能</p>
<p>美國亦有</p>
<p>春秋經上說：「六鑄退飛，隕石於宋。」其實美國亦有這種傳說。</p>
<p>最喜自豪的美國堪嚴斯州，有一種奇怪的故事，據說堪薩斯州有一種Jayhawk能够退飛，所以「無往而不利」。該州一位歷史家並考據稱：這種神鳥雙目突出，當它飛行時，一眼看八方」。</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress Convenes Special Session</h3>
<p>The U.S. Congress convened a special session yesterday, with President Truman addressing the assembly. The convening of this special session is of considerable significance and is not a frequent occurrence in American history. Typically, the U.S. Congress will reconvene in Washington D.C. in January of the following year, and special congressional sessions are usually avoided unless there are matters of particular importance. As the name suggests, "special" sessions are called only for extraordinary events. Since the founding of the United States, only 25 special congressional sessions have been held in the past 150 years. This time, President Truman invoked the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution and, on the 23rd of last month, sent a message to Congress scheduling a special session for the 17th of this month, making it the 26th special congressional session in American history. The convocation of this special session clearly indicates that President Truman considers the current situation to be extremely serious, thus necessitating the special session. Due to recent developments in international affairs, the convening of this special congressional session not only concerns developments in American domestic politics but also has a significant impact on the subsequent evolution of the world situation. Therefore, the convening of this special session is not only of concern to the American people but also attracts the attention of people around the world.</p>
<p>As of this writing, we have not yet had the opportunity to read President Truman's message. However, based on reports from various news agencies, it is not difficult to discern that the purpose of this special congressional session is to seek stability for the world and for the United States itself. The European Recovery Program (ERP), i.e., the Marshall Plan for European aid, and efforts to control the trend of domestic inflation in the United States, are all aimed at achieving stability for the world, especially Western Europe, and the United States. According to reports, the U.S. government will ask Congress to approve the use of $597 million in U.S. dollars as temporary emergency relief for France, Italy, and Austria. At the same time, President Truman will appeal for price stabilization to curb the trend of inflation. As for the long-term plan for European aid, i.e., the estimated $12 billion or $17 billion needed over the next four years, we have not yet received confirmation as to whether it will be proposed or considered at this special congressional session. Regardless of whether the entire European Recovery Program will be presented for consideration at this special congressional session, the convening of this session will undoubtedly involve a review and determination regarding the overall world situation and the domestic situation in the United States.</p>
<p>From the current indications, the convening of this special congressional session will be an important test for President Truman. The U.S. Congress is currently controlled by the Republican Party, and it seems difficult for President Truman, a Democrat, to expect flexible maneuvering during this special congressional session. Therefore, President Truman is attempting to present the European aid plan and the price control plan as policies that transcend partisan interests and are supported by the entire country. Whether members of Congress, the majority of whom are Republicans, can accept this policy remains to be seen, but based on current indications, President Truman may encounter difficulties.</p>
<p>Firstly, from the perspective of foreign policy, since General Marshall returned to the United States to take office as Secretary of State, the United States has lacked a clear and firm policy toward the Far East. General Wedemeyer's report remains in the State Department's safe without being published, while Marshall's plan for aid to Europe is particularly large. Republican congressmen such as Senator Taft have already criticized this, arguing that the aid plan for Europe must be proposed at the same time as the aid plan for China in order to have a complete world plan. According to a report in "Time" magazine, Marshall finally changed his policy of watchful waiting toward China in response to pressure from Congress and proposed his $300 million aid plan for China. This is hardly comparable to his proposed aid plan for Europe. It can be seen that Congress and the government do not entirely agree on foreign policy. According to available news, Congress will only consider the temporary plan for aid to Europe, but even this temporary plan may not be fully supported by Congress.</p>
<p>Secondly, speaking of the domestic situation in the United States, President Truman's opposition to tax cuts is also in conflict with the Republican Party's policy. The Republican Party naturally wants to win over voters for next year's presidential election, and the only effective way to win over voters is through tax cuts. Now, the plan for aid to Europe involves a huge sum of money, and President Truman believes that this huge sum must rely on tax revenue to support it in order to avoid inflation. However, Republican congressmen may not see it that way. As for how to control the soaring prices in the United States, if President Truman advocates restoring wartime price controls or a rationing system, Republicans may also be unwilling to accept it. Therefore, in terms of domestic policy, President Truman's policies and the Republican-controlled Congress may not be able to blend harmoniously.</p>
<p>However, standing in the objective position of a third party and from a broader perspective, we hope that the convening of this special congressional session will achieve satisfactory results. It has been two years since the end of the war, but the world as a whole is still in turmoil. In this turbulent world, the United States is undoubtedly the only stabilizing force. We hope that American politicians can have a broad global vision, not be stubborn with their own prejudices, and not be constrained by partisan political struggles, and can make comprehensive plans for the current global situation. Only in this way can they be worthy of being the world's leaders.</p>
<h3>Chairman Receives French Medal</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) "Mr. Chairman: I am deeply honored to be here on behalf of the President of France to bestow upon you the Military Medal. The heroes of China's War of Resistance, unparalleled in their courage and determination, are admired infinitely by the government of my country. Your strategic planning is exemplary, and therefore we specially bestow upon you the highest French Military Medal, to commend your outstanding contributions. In those years, the Chinese and French armies fought together, which strengthened the bond between the two countries. This honor is bestowed to commemorate this forever. Observing the enemy's rampant actions, both the Chinese and French nations are aware of the cruelty of invasion, and both have been tempered to fight to the death for the freedom of their homelands. The banner of victory will ultimately fly with triumphant songs. Today, the people of China and France look forward to the future, and all hope that the world of tomorrow will become a paradise of freedom and justice, so that future generations will be forever spared the pain of trampling and bloodshed. The significance of this award, has been fully described in the award speech, which is based on the order of the French army. Now I will read it to you:</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang of the National Government of the Republic of China, with his unwavering belief in the future of his country, was the first to rise up to resist totalitarian imperialism and its invasion of peaceful nations. Since July 7, 1937, he has led the people of the whole country to resist foreign aggression with diligence and perseverance. First he fought alone, and then he cooperated with the Allied nations. He led and commanded this glorious and arduous battle for years, until the Japanese invaders surrendered. As the leader who presided over this most difficult war of resistance, he has won the eternal praise and admiration of all democratic countries."</p>
<h3>Japanese Reparation Goods Are Good</h3>
<p>(Continued from page one) Regarding the handling of all Japanese reparations goods, Mr. Zhou said: The Tokyo Reparations Committee is continuing to discuss the matter. The second batch of goods to be dismantled and removed, including experimental research equipment from the army, navy, and air force arsenals, as well as synthetic rubber equipment, will have their allocation amounts agreed upon by various countries in the near future. He expressed his satisfaction with the harmonious atmosphere within the Reparations Committee, which he considered rare among international organizations. However, he predicted that disputes among countries would be inevitable when the handling of piece-by-piece reparations tools is completed and the dismantling and selection of entire factories begins. Mr. Zhou went on to remind the people of the country of their understanding of reparations goods, saying: Reparations goods are not scrap metal. Based on our observations after visiting more than 100 Japanese factories, the quality of Japanese factories is generally very good. Japanese factories use the most advanced manufacturing methods in the world, and even in the chemical industry, the United States is beyond their reach. Therefore, we should pay attention to reparations goods. The significance of obtaining reparations goods lies not only in restricting Japan's industrial level but also in using them to establish our country's basic industries.</p>

The following is an excerpt from a repentance confession published by Gao Peigan, a cadre member, to give a glimpse of the situation: The confession stated: "The Communist bandits have wiped out human relations. Even after searching through the Twenty-Four Histories, no such records can be found. Anyone with a human heart hates them. The people in the bandit areas are all confused, and everyone's face is withered, yellow, and thin. They (the Communist bandits) keep talking about democracy and freedom of speech, but have they done any of it? Isn't it just that group of male bandits and female prostitutes who monopolize everything! No one in the bandit area dares to fart. They must say that they are good. If they say that they are not good, they are either KMT spies or reactionaries, and their lives are in danger! I have truly tasted the taste of the Communist bandits. Now, with the illusion of being dead yesterday and alive today, I will do my best for the country to help in this suppression work and complete the great cause of national construction. We must send these inhuman and evil Communist bandits all into the fire pit so that China can see the light of day again."</p>

<h3>Supervisory Committee Proposes Three Points to Improve Military Uniforms and Rations</h3>
<p>Submitted to the Executive Yuan by President Yu</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Li Shijun, a supervisor of the Control Yuan, believes that the quality of military uniforms and rations is of great importance during the period of mobilization and war, as it affects the morale and health of soldiers. He has put forward three suggestions for improvement, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan by President Yu for attention and improvement. The suggestions are as follows: The cloth used for military uniforms must meet the specified standards for color, area, weight, etc. The supply agencies should formally sign a contract with the China Textile Corporation or other specialized textile manufacturers, and the audit department should send personnel to inspect and accept the goods at the time of delivery. If there is any non-compliance or delay in delivery, the contractors should bear legal responsibility. The cotton used in winter uniforms for officers and soldiers must meet the specified standards and must not be short in weight or substandard in quality. Military rations and flour must meet the specified standards. The grain administration agencies should be responsible for this, and the military flour should maintain a precision of 75%. First- and second-class flour must not be extracted. If the quality of military rations and flour is found to be substandard after delivery, the receiving agency should be responsible. If the quality is questioned by the receiving personnel at the time of delivery, the audit agency or the inspector's office in the locality should send personnel to identify it together with representatives of the highest local public opinion organs.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Issues Statement on the Inferior Military Flour Case</h3>

Regardless of the content, they have constituted another illegal act according to the regulations listed above, and the Control Yuan will not ignore it.</p>

<h3>Chinese Immigrants to the Philippines Face Strict Restrictions</h3>
<p>Some Philippine Congressmen Are Still Unsatisfied</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Manila, 17th] The Philippines has extremely strict restrictions on the entry of foreigners, especially Chinese citizens. According to statistics from the Philippine Immigration Bureau's records, from February 1946 to the end of October this year, the Immigration Bureau has only allowed 129 students, 32 teachers, and 40 Chinese "temporary visitors" to enter the country. The Philippine Immigration Law has many similarities with the U.S. Immigration Law. All non-immigrant aliens, or those entering the Philippines within the annual immigration quota, are considered "temporary visitors" whose period of stay is only six months, after which they can apply for an extension of six months. Students and teachers can enter under more lenient procedures, but after entry, they must be subject to inquiries by the Immigration Bureau at any time to prove that they have not engaged in other businesses during their stay in the Philippines. Upon completion of their studies or teaching, they must leave the country. Furthermore, among the 40 "temporary visitors" in the past year and eight months, according to reporters, some who were approved never came to the Philippines, and some went back and forth between China, which resulted in several people being counted as one. The general situation regarding the restrictions on the entry of foreigners can be seen from this. However, some congressmen still believe this is insufficient and intend to find ways to strengthen the restrictions on entry.</p>
<h3>Two Hundred Workers Die Tragically in a Coal Mine</h3>

<h3>Kang Province Tightens County-Level Organizations</h3>
<p>[This Newspaper, Yaan, 17th] The counties in Kang Province are all barren, and their revenues and expenditures cannot be balanced.

The salaries of county-level civil servants and teachers cannot be increased, which leads to unstable lives and affects administrative efficiency. The provincial government has now decided to increase tax revenues as much as possible, strictly eliminate malpractices, and ensure that every bit of revenue goes to the public. It will also tighten county-level organizations, reduce staff and posts, and disapprove any unnecessary expenditures in order to adapt to the situation.</p>

After Speaker of the House Martin and Senate President Vandenberg announced the opening of the meeting, President Truman (see picture) attended and delivered a speech, clarifying the government's attitude on the two major issues of aid to Europe and preventing domestic inflation. He strongly advocated using $597 million as emergency aid to Italy, France, and Austria, and in order to prevent the economic situation from affecting the United States domestically, he proposed ten basic measures: 1. Ration consumer goods that are scarce domestically and sufficient to affect people's lives; 2. Set price limits for domestic scarce and sufficient products to affect people's lives, and in order to implement the stipulated price limits, appropriate restrictions should be placed on wages; 3. Strengthen housing rent control; 4. Control scarce materials that are closely related to life; 5. Speculative commodity transactions should be controlled; 6. Restrict bank lending; 7. Strengthen export controls; 8. Continue to control the distribution of transportation vehicles and equipment; 9. Restrict the use of grains to feed livestock and poultry, so that grains can be used for more practical needs; 10. Authorize the Department of Agriculture to draft plans to encourage people to store food and find ways to increase production abroad.</p>
<p>President Truman praised Marshall's aid to Europe plan. According to estimates by Marshall, the amount of U.S. aid to Europe within four years will be between 16 billion and 20 billion. The President urged Congress to quickly pass the $597 million in emergency aid to Italy, France, and Austria to help them through the difficult winter, believing that this action could prove the United States' determination to support Western European countries in maintaining democracy and freedom until they can become self-sufficient. If Congress can pass emergency aid and then pass long-term aid, it will write a glorious page in world history. But in order to achieve this goal, domestic economics must also strive for stability, because aid to Europe and economic controls are complementary.</p>
<p>1. The U.S. Congress Special Session's Development Will Affect Future Leadership</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th, United Press] The U.S. Congress Special Session convened this Monday will be seen around the world as a measure of the United States' willingness and ability to enhance its leadership position in the world after World War II. The speed and determination with which Congress completes legislation on the reconstruction of Western Europe can indicate whether historical trends will lead the United States to relinquish its major responsibilities overseas after the war, or will instead strengthen its political power in the world. This Congress Special Session will continue until the normal Congress convenes on January 3rd of next year. Although the leaders will follow the purpose of convening the special session and try to focus their initial attention on issues such as temporary aid and measures to prevent inflation, congressional regulations still allow other issues to be raised to Congress before January of next year.</p>
<p>Other issues awaiting formal congressional action include the immigration of refugees, general policy toward China, the progress and effectiveness of U.S. aid to Greece and Turkey, the behavior and discipline of U.S. military and political personnel in occupied countries, authorization for the "Voice of America" broadcasting program or other news organizations to refute the Communist International's reports on the U.S. situation, the situation of overseas surplus materials, the currency of occupied countries, the situation of oil mines in the Middle East, and the Anglo-American oil agreement. The U.S. government will also choose an appropriate time to submit the Rio de Janeiro Inter-American Security Treaty to the Senate for approval. Judging from the participation of Vandenberg and Connally in the Rio de Janeiro Conference, the treaty can be quickly approved. During the debate on the Marshall Plan, Congress may spark a discussion on Pan-American economic issues.</p>

<h3>On the Issue of Limiting the Use of the Veto Power, the United States and the Soviet Union Will Clash Head-On, the United Nations General Assembly is Nearing its End</h3>
<p>[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] The United States today seems confident of victory in the General Assembly on its proposal to study how to ease and limit the use of the veto power by the five permanent members of the Security Council for a period of one year. U.S. Representative Dulles told Soviet Representative Gromyko in a private consultation yesterday that the United States would push forward with this movement regardless of the Soviet Union's strong opposition to limiting the veto power.</p>
<p>Dulles essentially notified the Soviet Union that it would demand the abolition of the use of the veto power in cases submitted to the Security Council under the chapter of the Constitution on peaceful resolution and in cases concerning the admission of new member states to the United Nations. In this way, the use of the veto power would be limited only to cases directly threatening peace or aggression. It is reported that Gromyko solemnly stated that the Soviet Union is determined to maintain the veto power unchanged and opposes any attacks on this power by small countries. Any changes to the veto power clauses in the United Nations Charter are themselves bound by the veto power, so at this time, no matter whether the General Assembly demands changes or not, any actual changes are impossible. Voting on this issue is expected to take place after the resolution of the South African discrimination against Indians case on the 17th.</p>
<p>[United Press, Flushing, 17th] The United Nations General Assembly has begun its tenth week, which may also be the last week of work for the 1947 session.

The plan of the Palestine partition subcommittee should be submitted on Wednesday or Thursday, and the General Assembly will begin discussions. The veto power issue is expected to spark fierce debate.</p>

<p>[United Press, Paris, 17th] People close to Prime Minister Ramadier predicted today that former Prime Minister Reynaud will form a new cabinet within the next few weeks.

<h3>On the Eve of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, Germany Expresses its Wishes</h3>
<p>Opposes the Separation of Saar from Germany</p>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] The leader of the German Christian Democratic Party, Kaiser, gave a speech at a public meeting here, emphasizing that the German people will never accept the Oder-Neisse line as the border between Germany and Poland, and the separation of the Saar region from Germany. The Oder-Neisse line will make it impossible for the German people to manufacture compensation goods, so it is by no means a fair and just peaceful resolution. The German people will also never agree to the political or economic separation of the Saar region from Germany. Kaiser also advocated that the peace treaty with Germany should at least stipulate the future program of the German state and stipulate a compensation plan.</p>

<h3>Japanese Communist Party Launches Offensive: Conspires to Incite Nationwide General Strike</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] According to sources close to the headquarters of the Japanese Communist Party, general labor unions incited by the Communist Party are currently adopting guerilla tactics. These unions have now launched an offensive, and their power is gradually expanding nationwide.</p>
<p>Up until a few days ago, there were 58 labor unions on strike in Japan, and another 216 labor unions were also brewing strikes. The aforementioned figures do not include hundreds of communist-affiliated groups, such as public utility agencies run by the government, where employers are now attempting to take slowdown actions. Communist labor organizers claim that the number of workers currently participating in strikes exceeds that of the general strike planned for February 1st of this year. It is reported that the number of workers participating in the general strike at the beginning of this year totaled 2.5 million. Communist labor leaders today claim that the number of workers participating in strikes across the country exceeds 3 million. In other words, the power of the so-called Japanese labor movement has largely recovered after being severely damaged in February of this year. The organizers of the strike movement intend to create a situation in which industry is paralyzed, public utilities are shut down, and the national economy is in a slump, so that the government finds itself politically unable to stand. Communist labor leaders have not set a deadline for their offensive, but believe that a crisis will occur no later than March of next year.</p>

Mayor Wu often accepted the requests of the households, allowing them to voluntarily demolish and relocate from the fifteenth day of the next lunar new year to the end of the first lunar month. Mayor Wu earnestly explained the authorities' painstaking efforts to build a new Shanghai and urged the residents to understand the difficulties and cooperate sincerely. If there are still those who have not demolished and relocated by the deadline, in addition to the government's compulsory execution, the households that have not demolished and relocated shall compensate the government for the losses incurred due to the delay of the project. All of this shall be guaranteed by the heads of the households to the Public Works Bureau. Among them, the Huizhong Tobacco Factory and the Xiechang Shunji Timber Company have ample land left after demolition and relocation. Mayor Wu instructed the heads of the two households to follow the government's laws and regulations, strive to be role models for citizens, and voluntarily relocate from today. The municipal government will give them certificates of commendation and encourage them, and ordered the two households to report to the municipal government today to answer.</p>

<h3>Chen Jicheng's Application for Retrial Dismissed by Supreme Court</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Jicheng, the former puppet ambassador to Manchuria, was previously sentenced to indefinite imprisonment by the High Court and approved by the Supreme Court.

<h3>Building Houses for Charity Sale to Raise Funds for Winter Relief: Winter Relief Fundraising Committee Suggests</h3>
<p>In order to raise a large amount of donations, the Winter Relief Fundraising Committee suggested to the Relief Association yesterday to change the charity lottery method and issue a kind of charity sale ticket to solve the housing shortage. The content of the suggestion is excerpted as follows: "In order to cater to the social psychology of solving the housing shortage, it is planned to build 100 or 200 houses immediately and issue a kind of charity sale ticket. After deducting the base and construction costs, the remainder will be used as winter relief funds. This method is easier to raise large sums of money, and it can also solve part of the housing shortage in this city. It is proposed to set the total amount of charity sale tickets issued at 100 billion or 150 billion, of which 50 billion will be donated as winter relief funds." According to this suggestion, the 50 billion for winter relief can be donated in full. This suggestion has been sent to the Relief Association yesterday. After the Relief Association reviews and approves it, the Fundraising Committee can easily raise 50 billion for donations.</p>

<h3>Carjacking Double-Gun Robber Perspires While Confessing His Intentions: Planned to Drive to a Dance Hall to Rob; Claims to Have Attempted Suicide Twice</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The case of Chen Zhanzhi, the "double-gun robber," robbing a 1947 Chevrolet champagne sedan belonging to Mrs. Hecha, the Russian manager of the American Coal Company, at around 2:00 PM on the 30th of last month, being intercepted and arrested in front of the Municipal Police Bureau on Fuzhou Road, was sent to the District Court on the 15th of this month after interrogation by the Criminal Division of the Police Bureau. Yesterday, it was brought to the Third Criminal Court for questioning, presided over by Judge Hu Zhichao. Chen Zhanzhi has a handsome face and a slender body, wearing a gray suit and a herringbone overcoat, with gold-rimmed glasses on his nose. He confessed: "I am 23 years old, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, a graduate of the Overseas Chinese Middle School. I used to work as a translator for the US military and am currently unemployed. I came to Shanghai on October 21st of this year and stayed at Room 1311 on the 13th floor of the International Hotel. At noon on the 30th, I saw a blue car parked on Gufu Road. I sat in and threatened the driver with a revolver to drive to Longhua, and then to Jing'an Temple Road. He refused to drive any further, so I let him go down. I drove east myself to the front of the police station on Fourth Ma Road, where I was surrounded by the police. I took out a revolver at the time, ready to commit suicide, but they took it away. Later, when I arrived at the police station, I wanted to jump from the fourth floor to commit suicide, but I didn't succeed." Chen stopped after stating all this in one breath, and frequently wiped his sweat with a handkerchief. Judge Hu asked what he intended to do if he had not been arrested that day. Chen replied, "I planned to drive to the entrance of a dance hall and rob rich people with guns." When asked where the two revolvers came from, he replied, "I bought them from the US military, one for 50 US dollars and the other for 75 US dollars." The confession ended here, and the court was adjourned, scheduled for continuation on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Chairman Pan Continues to Visit Yimiao and Other Districts, Explaining the True Meaning of Democratic Politics, All Citizens Should Not Give Up Voting</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] City Council Speaker Pan, yesterday (17th) continued to visit Yimiao, Fahua, Xuhui and other districts, visiting and giving campaign speeches. And at the joint expanded memorial week of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters of the third and fourth districts of this city, and the swearing-in ceremony of the executive committee members of various district branches, he stated the attitude that party members should have when participating in this election.</p>
<p>Chairman Pan first went to Nanshi at 10:00 am to visit various Bao in the Yimiao District, summarizing the opinions of representatives from various Bao. All agreed that the most important facility that must be improved at present is the electricity problem, because the citizens in the Nanshi area often suffer from power outages and hope that the authorities will pay attention. The chairman then gave a public speech at Guangfu Temple, attended by more than a thousand listeners.</p>
<p>Enhance the People's Democratic Level</p>
<p>During the meeting, he issued the essentials of constitutionalism, saying: China is moving towards a democratic path, and we must truly understand the meaning of democracy in order to obtain true democracy. The so-called true democracy is that the people have opinions and requests, which can be expressed to the government through reasonable and legal procedures, and all actions of the government must also respect public opinion, so that the government and the people can be one. The government now stipulates that the general election will be held on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of this month, and the constitution will be formally implemented on December 25th, which means reaching the constitutional stage, which means implementing democracy. The so-called constitutionalism is to change the people from being "governed" to "self-governed", and politics from "rule by man" to "rule of law", sweeping away the ills of "government exists when the person exists, and government ceases when the person dies". The people must have the power to manage people and the power to manage laws, the power to elect good people to do things, the power to remove officials who violate public opinion, the power to create laws they need, and the power to veto laws that harm the interests of the people, so that everything can be reformed by voting, without the need to mobilize millions of troops to fight for it. Therefore, these powers are rights and responsibilities. All citizens cannot give up the responsibilities that a master should have. Democratic politics is voting politics. Easily giving up voting means giving up democratic politics. That failing country must go down the path of guns and bullets. As for whether the country will embark on the right path of recovery, it depends on whether voters are enthusiastic in this election. Therefore, I hope everyone will be skilled in voting to improve national status and enhance the people's democratic level.</p>
<p>Will Seek More Benefits for Nanshi</p>
<p>When Mr. Pan stated the attitude that party members should have to the party headquarters of the third and fourth districts of this city, he gave two instructions: Comrades of our party should obey the party's instructions and orders. The candidates nominated by our party should be fully supported by all party members. Anyone who does not comply with party orders and runs for election without authorization will be sanctioned. Those from friendly parties and society who participate in the election should be assisted from the side so that they can jointly be responsible for national construction. In addition, he especially told the citizens of Nanshi: Nanshi is the source of Shanghai's prosperity, but because the concessions have been recovered, all facilities are more convenient than those in Nanshi. Therefore, the center of Shanghai's prosperity is still concentrated in the old concessions, causing Nanshi to lag behind. I hope that the citizens of Nanshi will catch up quickly, work together, and restore the past prosperity so that the old concession area will not be too crowded. In the future, I hope that the citizens of Nanshi will jointly support his campaign for the National Assembly representatives so that he can better serve the citizens of Nanshi and seek benefits for the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Speech at Zhongzheng Park Today</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Chairman Pan went to Xuhui District again and gave campaign speeches at Fahua Primary School and Tushanwan Orphanage. The chairman greatly admired the Fahua Mutual Aid Association for being able to gather local forces to build local autonomy, and hoped that it could be further promoted in the future.</p>
<p>Today (18th) at 3:00 pm, Chairman Pan will go to Jingzhou Road Elementary School in Jianlin District to give a speech on the topic "Appealing for Refugees"! At 4:00 pm, a large-scale campaign speech will be given in the square of Zhongzheng Park (ie Hongkou Public Concession) at the end of North Sichuan Road. The Friends of the Military Society will be responsible for entertainment programs in advance to entertain the audience.</p>
<p>The Medical Community Unanimously Elected Yao Yunjiang, Chairman of the Chinese National Medical Association, Tang Jifu, Executive Director, and Bao Juxiang, Director and Secretary-General, telegraphed the Shanghai National Medical Branch, the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Practitioners Association, the Shanghai National Medicine Industry Association, the Shanghai Medicinal Materials Industry Association, the Shanghai Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry Association, the Shanghai Leaf Industry Workers Union, various Chinese Medicine Hospitals, various Chinese Medicine Schools, Chinese Medicine Training Courses, Huzhou Shanghai Small and Medium Schools, and the Shanghai Industry Association yesterday, because Chen Guofu gave up running for the National Assembly representative in Shanghai, please unanimously re-elect Chairman Pan Gongzhan, because Chairman Pan has always been enthusiastic about maintaining Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Poor Students Endorse One After Another</p>
<p>According to Zheng Jie, the executive director of the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee, since the Central Government announced that Pan Zhurenwei Gongzhan of this committee was a candidate for the National Assembly representative in this city, poor students and their parents at all levels of schools in this city believed that Pan had spared no effort in presiding over the rescue of out-of-school work over the years, and appreciated the youth very much. Therefore, they have sent letters to this committee, expressing their willingness to elect Pan as the National Assembly representative in this city, and some students above the junior college level volunteered to assist Pan in promoting the campaign work. As of now, the committee has received more than 5,000 of these letters.</p>
<h3>Fang Zhi Gives a Speech, Speaking the Truth for the Common People</h3>
<p>Fang, the director of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters, gave public campaign speeches in the Tilamqiao District and the Datang District yesterday morning and afternoon, respectively, "Speaking a heartfelt word for the common people." He said briefly: To build a country, we must implement democratic constitutionalism, and to implement democratic constitutionalism, we must first start with handling elections. Only by completing the election can we implement democracy. This election of National Assembly representatives is really too important. If the elected representatives cannot speak for the common people, or what they say is not what the common people want to say, the relationship is really too important. Therefore, I hope that everyone will vote with conscience when voting, and vote for the person you think can represent you and speak the truth. Don't be bought by money and don't be coerced by violence, etc.</p>
<p>Also, the city's stone industry and other groups expressed their support for Fang's election as a National Assembly representative and jointly issued a declaration.</p>
<h3>Jiao Dingkai Gives Up the Election</h3>
<p>Mr. Jiao Dingkai, a well-known accountant and candidate for the National Assembly representative in this city, was repeatedly urged by senior fellow villagers to register and support his campaign. Recently, I heard that Jiao decided to give up the election due to the heavy workload of association affairs and business, and hoped that all fellow villagers would unanimously elect Can Neng.</p>

<h3>The Most Advanced High-Altitude Passenger Aircraft, Central Airlines Orders Six from the United States</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] Central Airlines recently ordered six Convair passenger aircraft from the American Voltee Company. They will be shipped one after another between March and May next year. This type of Convair passenger aircraft is the latest twin-engine aircraft exclusively for passenger transport approved by the US Civil Aviation Administration after the war. Its characteristics are: Equipped for high altitude, when flying at an altitude of more than 10,000 feet, the cabin has its own air, so passengers will not feel uncomfortable at all, and it is especially safe for those with weak hearts. The speed is faster than ordinary airplanes, reaching 300 miles per hour. The engine cover can be completely disassembled for easy repair. The propeller can rotate in the opposite direction, causing the effect of stopping forward, and assisting the braking force, so it can also land on a shorter runway. The seats in the aircraft are comfortable and equipped with sound insulation.</p>
<p>[Also News] Since the American-made DG-6 giant aircraft was launched, the aircraft has been grounded repeatedly. After experts have made detailed studies, the aircraft will be flown again. Our country's airlines originally planned to purchase this type of aircraft, but now it has been abandoned.</p>

<h3>Surveying the Middle Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, Bridge Travel</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Tai'an, 14th] There are four major bridges in the 156 kilometers from Yanzhou to Jinan. The destruction of the four major bridges by the communist bandits can be described as "painstaking". The largest of these is the Wenhe Bridge, which is 386.4 meters long, followed by the Xiaowenhe Bridge, which is 351.8 meters long, for a total of 738.2 meters. The second is the Panhe Bridge south of Tai'an, which is 265 meters long. The third is the Geyuhe Bridge about 2 kilometers south of Wander, which is 304 meters long, and the fourth is the Shidianhe Bridge about 5 kilometers south of Zhangxia, which is 215 meters long (the four major bridges are arranged in order from south to north). According to the villagers, the communist bandits spent more than 70 days destroying the four bridges, and the Shidianhe Bridge also took 40 days to complete the degree of destruction that the communist bandits considered satisfactory.</p>
<p>The Four Arches Were Most Severely Damaged</p>
<p>As of the time this reporter wrote this article, the Wenhe and Panhe bridges had already been restored, but both bridges are still temporary bridges. The former cost 30,000 sleepers, and the latter cost 8,000 sleepers, and they need to be rebuilt as permanent steel bridges. The Yantai line of the road has also been running a traffic car between Yanzhou and Tai'an once a day since the 10th of this month. The Geyuhe Bridge was originally a 14-arch cement bridge. After being destroyed, the four arches on the north side were filled with soil to save materials. The bridge piers with minor damage were repaired, and those with severe damage were rebuilt. Among them, the four arches in the middle with the most severe damage would take too long to rebuild according to the original style, but in order to get it done once and for all, Song Liancheng, the deputy director of the Engineering Department of the bureau, Song Jianfang, the section chief, and Wen Diao, the captain of the Ji'an repair team, "thought hard" and implemented "bridge travel", transferring two sections of the two-arch 23-meter steel bridge 3 kilometers away from the bridge and two sections of the 20-meter steel machine 361 meters away from it. They were moved to the Geyuhe River to fill the four holes. (The two bridges originally passed through the river, but because they have been silted up, there is no need for bridges in fact), and became a permanent project with six arched bridges and four steel structures. Although this is very unsightly on the outside, it is as strong as a new bridge in terms of firmness.</p>
<p>Miracle of Bridge Travel</p>
<p>However, "bridge travel" is really easier said than done. When the tools are extremely simple and limited by the objective environment, and some of the tools are sometimes unusable, it is the employees of the road who have come up with unique ideas and ingenious designs. It was not easy to "travel" the four steel bridges to the Geyuhe River, because the steel bridges weighed hundreds of tons, or at least eighty tons, and the largest lifting machine the road had was only forty tons. Even if two forty-ton machines were used at the same time at both ends, the northern side could not be transported due to the isolation of Jinan from the outside. Therefore, they could only lay sleepers on the Geyuhe River (in fact, because there were few sleepers, they could only lay them on two arches), and move the hundred-ton steel bridge to the sleepers with great difficulty. Then, multiple 35-ton or 50-ton "clamps" were placed on the bottom beam of the steel bridge, and slowly lifted root by root, and the sleepers were removed one by one until the two ends of the steel bridge were smoothly placed on the stone structure. Today, the northwest wind is strong, and the employees are especially cautious and fearful when working, so as to avoid accidents.</p>
<p>Unnamed Heroes of Road Construction</p>
<p>Although the length of the Shidianhe Bridge is the shortest among the four major bridges, it is 22 meters deep, so the enemy tried their best when repairing it. As early as the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders, fearing that the bridge would be bombed and affect their north-south traffic, built another temporary bridge several hundred meters west of the original bridge. The bridge was not completed when the Japanese invaders surrendered, and the project was terminated. The road bureau planned to restore the water-resistant steel bridge, which could not be completed in the short term. It used more than 11,000 sleepers to build the temporary bridge first, and in order to reduce the slope of the road surface (the terrain is particularly high) and the depth of the bridge piers, it dug a channel on both sides, which was 5 kilometers long, and 110,000 cubic meters of earthwork, costing more than 60,000 man-days. This is as Captain An said: "We can only rely on human power to make up for the lack of material resources." He also said: "The most hardworking and resilient workers in the world are Chinese workers, and the Chinese workers are the most capable of 'lifting' under the most inferior tool conditions in the world." The biggest feeling I had after witnessing the Tianjin-Pukou Middle Section Yanjin Section, which was condensed by the blood and sweat of all these ten thousand railway employees, was: "In order to call on and study the technology of breaking roads, the Communist Party has long launched a so-called 'explosion hero', and publicly gave this kind of hero many material and honorary encouragements. On the other hand, the government side, like the above-mentioned Song An and others, actually does not know how many unnamed heroes of road construction are there. Who cares about them for completing the sublime national construction project?" (Our newspaper sent a special correspondent, Li Tian)</p>

<h3>Hai Ning Uncovers Trafficking Ring of Young Girls; Group of Perpetrators Transferred to District Court for Trial</h3>
<p>Li Jinhua Deceived, Resolutely Refuses, Insisting on Returning Home</p>
<p>Qin Zhumei Abused by Stepmother, Lured Away When Going Out</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Hai Ning, 16th Dispatch] The county police bureau recently uncovered an organized trafficking ring of young girls and has already transferred one thousand perpetrators to the district court for trial on the 16th. The incident began on the 14th at 8 p.m., when the bureau received a telegram from the road patrol's public self-defense force, stating that they had apprehended a human trafficker named Song Xiaogou and a 14-year-old girl who had been victimized. They also claimed that Song Xiaogou had implicated an accomplice named Dong Wangshi from Hangzhou, who was hiding at No. 30 Yongxiu Fang, Southwest River, Xia Shi. The bureau immediately dispatched a patrol officer and police to apprehend Dong Wangshi, bringing her back to the bureau. Dong Wangshi claimed to be from Shaoxing, 80 years old, residing on Laodong Road, Hangzhou. At first, she denied any involvement in trafficking young girls, but after several interrogations, she confessed that she had accomplices named Chu Ma, residing at No. 66 Lower East Street, Xia Shi, and Gu Xiangshi, residing at Xutou, Xia Shi. The police went to arrest them one after another, and at Gu Xiangshi's residence in Hengtou, they rescued a young girl named Li Jinhua.</p>
<p>According to Li Jinhua's statement, she is from Zhuji, 16 years old, with a father named Li Gengqian and a mother named Yang. Due to poverty, she went to Hangzhou alone to find her younger uncle, intending to work as a servant for someone. However, the wages were too low. Later, she met Chu Ma, who told her that there was work in Xia Shi with high wages. She went to Xia Shi with Chu Ma last month. She was taken to Shanghai by Wu Zhu Shi, who lived at No. 2 Qun'en Road, Xia Shi, to be sold as a maid, but the price was not right. She returned to Xia Shi and was locked up in Gu Xiangshi's house. Later, Grandma Dou (residing at Shilan Bridge, Lower East Guard, Xia Shi) introduced two Songjiang people who intended to buy her for 15 dan of grain and some cash. When Jinhua learned of this, she realized she had been deceived. She resolutely refused and insisted on being allowed to return home. Gu Xiangshi then invited two men, one wearing a yellow uniform and a wooden-handled gun, the other wearing a blue cloth long gown and a felt hat, to threaten her. Fortunately, the police arrived, and she was rescued from the fire pit. After the police interrogated the perpetrators, they dispatched officers to arrest the relevant accomplices.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the human trafficker Song Xiaogou, the buyer Shen Sanmao, and the deceived girl Qin Zhumei, who were apprehended by the road patrol's public self-defense force, were handed over to the bureau on the 15th and interrogated by the judicial section. According to Qin Zhumei's statement, she is from Hang County, residing at Hair'er Lane, Hangzhou. She ran away from home due to abuse from her stepmother. She met a woman on the road (namely Dong Wangshi, who was apprehended in Xia Shi), who lured her to Xia Shi. She lived in Song Xiaogou's house and was lured to Shen Sanmao's house in Beicheng, Luzhong, on the 10th. Shen Sanmao took her to the home of Second Aunt Wang, a boat dweller on Luzhong Street, intending to sell her for ten dan of rice. Later, after learning that Qin Zhumei's background was unknown, they refused to take her and reported it to the Luzhong Township Self-Defense Force. This organized trafficking case was thus uncovered.</p>
<p>The authorities believe that the case involves significant matters and that Li Jinhua and Qin Zhumei may not be the only deceived girls. They are currently continuing the investigation and may make new discoveries.</p>

<h3>Geological Society of China Annual Meeting Held in Taiwan: Significant Academic Importance</h3>
<p>Bi Qingchang, Director of the Taiwan Geological Survey</p>
<p>The Geological Society of China will hold its 23rd annual meeting in Taipei, Taiwan, starting on November 18th. The first three days will be a conference for papers, with over a hundred papers to be presented on geology, mineralogy, petrology, stratigraphy, and paleontology. Afterwards, daily field trips will be taken to Wulai, Shanzijiao, and Datun near Taipei to study the unique strata of Taiwan. Finally, groups will visit the Miaoli oil fields and the Jinguashi mine for two days each of investigation. The Geological Society of China was established twenty-five years ago and is one of the oldest academic organizations in our country. Furthermore, because its activities have never been interrupted in the past twenty-five years, it truly demonstrates the continuous progress of geological research in China. This time, holding its meeting in Taiwan, from a national perspective, it is the first annual meeting of a national academic organization after the restoration; from Taiwan's perspective, it is the first geological society annual meeting, both before and after the restoration, because Japan has never held such a large-scale conference here. Now, over eighty geological workers are gathering, some of whom have come from as far as Beijing, Lanzhou, and Guangzhou. The topics of the papers cover all branches of geology, and the research objects are located throughout the country. This is truly an unprecedented academic gathering on the island!</p>
<p>The reason why the Geological Society of China chose Taiwan as the location for its annual meeting has its special significance. To understand that the special significance is not just for sightseeing, we should first understand some of the geological characteristics of Taiwan and mainland China. The geological record preserved on mainland China is extremely rich and relatively complete: from the oldest Precambrian period to the early Mesozoic, countless marine and terrestrial changes and vicissitudes are clearly discernible. However, since the middle Mesozoic era, the continental crust has gradually become stable: Shenzhou will never sink. Although each subsequent period also has well-developed strata as its representative, there has been no large-scale marine sedimentation, especially in the later Cenozoic era, there are only relatively shallow red strata representing basins. But during this period when sedimentation on mainland China was gradually declining, the southern edge of the Eurasian continent was undergoing the largest sedimentation. This zone stretches from Southern Europe in the west, through Asia Minor, Iran, India, Myanmar, the South Pacific islands, to Taiwan in the east, giving rise to the majestic Alps, Himalayas, and Taiwan mountains that stand on this zone today. Through the restoration of Taiwan, the geological history of China has finally been completed by recovering this wonderful page that had been lost! We now have Tertiary marine strata, and these strata helped coal and oil return to the motherland together. Indeed, for the Chinese geologists who have gone through eight years of bitter fighting and finally returned our rivers and mountains, there is double the joy and sorrow among the 400 million compatriots! This time they are meeting in Taiwan to rush to read this large article that has returned to the territory, so dozens of people have gathered upon hearing the news, all eager to see it first. The places they will visit are very different from those arranged on the itineraries of ordinary visitors to Taiwan: this can explain their intentions.</p>
<p>In addition to the deposition of strata, Taiwan is also of the first importance in the world in terms of tectonic structure. Vertically, it is the link between the Ryukyu arc and the Luzon arc; horizontally, it is the boundary between the largest continent and the largest ocean; more comprehensively, combining the vertical and horizontal aspects, it is the junction of the world's two major tectonic zones (the Pacific Ring of Fire and the Mediterranean belt), which are characterized by the concentration of earthquakes and volcanic activity. This "strategic" position has made Taiwan a "fortress" in the world's tectonic structure. Being in it, you really feel that every detail has its profound meaning. For this reason alone, it is worth for geologists to come from thousands of miles away. As for Taiwan itself, the structure is also extremely complex; the large-scale inversion and thrust faults swept from the depths of the geosyncline are the same type as those seen in the Alps, which is a holy place in structural geology. These are also difficult to see on mainland China, where basement folds are the main type of large structure. In addition, Taiwan also has several kinds of underground resources, and geologists are certainly more concerned than others about their value among Chinese people. Therefore, in a short period of time, they do not hesitate to spend two days each on the Miaoli oil fields and the Jinguashi mine.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been restored for two full years, and many people have come here during the two years. We dare not say how much they have done to help the Taiwanese compatriots who have been separated for a long time to re-understand the motherland. Therefore, the members of the Geological Society of China who come to Taiwan this time also have another great responsibility invisibly. We believe that they will definitely be able to complete this responsibility with a new look and a fact that moves people's feelings. (November 15th at the Taiwan Geological Survey)</p>

<h3>Not Yet Time to Open Free Foreign Exchange: Stabilization Fund to Be Reorganized, Focusing on "Stabilization" Work to Meet Actual Needs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 17th Dispatch] There were previous rumors that the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee would be abolished, but relevant parties have not acknowledged this. However, according to financial circles, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee will be reorganized into the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee. Since the establishment of the Stabilization Fund Committee, the "funds" it holds are insufficient to achieve a stabilization effect. Those in charge have repeatedly suggested reorganizing it, and after many discussions, this decision was made.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Regarding the rumor that the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee was abolished, the reporter made a special visit to the relevant authorities on the 17th. It was said that nothing had been heard, and the current foreign exchange stabilization policy is proceeding according to the original plan. There is no change whatsoever.</p>
<p>[Another News] The once fluctuating finance and prices have stabilized in recent days as a result of the authorities' proper measures to control the situation with calmness. However, yesterday it was rumored that the three major figures in finance will travel to the United States together within a few days, but the results of inquiries all indicated that nothing had been heard.</p>
<p>[United News Agency Dispatch] According to Shen Xirui, director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank and member of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, the rumor that the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee is about to be abolished has been proven untrue by Nanjing. At present, all foreign exchange stabilization policies are proceeding according to the original plan, without any changes. Regarding the proposal of free foreign exchange, Shen believes that it is not a fundamental solution. Because after the implementation of free foreign exchange, it cannot be guaranteed whether the black market will disappear due to supply and demand, and whether exports can improve as ideally as possible. Nowadays, people generally like to pursue the new, and after each method is implemented, they feel it is wrong and advocate reform. After the reform, problems arise again, and they can never be satisfied. I still agree with change, and free foreign exchange is not impossible, but whether it is suitable for needs after another change is quite a problem. What the government hopes for today is a long-term and thorough plan in order to maintain it permanently. Freedom should have conditions and limitations, not like a wild horse, let it run freely.</p>
<h3>Sudden Opening Has Greater Impact</h3>
<p>[China Economic News Agency] Recently, there have been widespread rumors that the government will consider conditionally opening free foreign exchange. Yesterday, according to an authoritative figure in the economic and financial circles of this city, this is the speculation of general merchants. In fact, foreign exchange control is still better than opening today. At present, the market price of foreign exchange differs greatly from the listed price in Hong Kong. If free foreign exchange is suddenly opened, the price of foreign exchange will jump and rise a lot, which is enough to stimulate prices and affect people's livelihoods. Under the control of foreign exchange, people know that privately operating and buying and selling foreign exchange is an illegal act, and they dare not trade openly. On the contrary, the increase in transactions after opening is inevitable. Moreover, opening free foreign exchange has problems with politics and society. It should be opened in a stable situation so as not to have other effects. At present, it can only continue to be controlled. However, in the control, several major items should be determined, such as encouraging exports and striving for overseas remittances, and the government should provide flexible methods to make them have reasonable transactions to balance foreign exchange revenue and expenditure.</p>
<h3>Even If Foreign Exchange Control is Abolished, Import and Export Industries Are Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>Regarding the change of foreign exchange control policy, the abolition of the current foreign exchange market price and stabilization fund, and the change to a free foreign exchange trade policy, it has been rumored in the market recently. Although the relevant parties have repeatedly denied it, the rumor became even more intense in the market yesterday. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency made separate visits to import and export giants who have a close relationship with this matter, and the combined opinions are as follows: The current foreign exchange control policy cannot only eliminate the black market, but on the contrary, because the difference between the black market and the market price is so large that overseas remittances are evaded and exports are difficult, it is indeed necessary to improve it. If the current control policy is immediately changed to a free foreign exchange trade policy, the consequence will inevitably stimulate a further surge in export materials and foreign exchange, leading to a general rise in prices. Overseas remittances may therefore be able to obtain a small number of returns, and the export industry will still fall into a higher predicament. In order for the government to balance the foreign exchange fund and facilitate the entire import and export business, and at the same time eliminate the foreign exchange black market, there is only the implementation of an import and export linking system. Under the principle that the government does not supply foreign exchange, exports are used to balance imports of foreign exchange. At the same time, the government can stipulate that a certain percentage of export foreign exchange should be used for imports, and the balance can be purchased by the government at the market price. In this way, the government's foreign exchange fund can gradually become abundant, and the import and export business of the people can become more active. As for the black market, because its needs are reduced, it can also disappear gradually.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Decline, Foreign Stocks Rise</h3>
<p>Government bonds declined yesterday. Tongbing opened at 22,000 yuan in the morning. They were sold to 21,300 yuan at Room 360. There were purchases at a low price at Room 628 and then it stabilized slightly. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Jia and Yi bonds fell by 600 yuan, Tongbing dropped by 200 yuan, Tongding fell by 900 yuan, Tongwu fell by 500 yuan, and the turnover was about 5 million.</p>
<p>The buying of foreign stocks expanded yesterday. Investors took advantage of the reorganization of various companies to repeatedly compete for purchases. Yisha started from 248,000 yuan in the morning and rose to more than 285,000 yuan at the end. Hong Kong Shen fell to five yuan and some cents. Money exchange helpers sold a lot, while Guangbang foreign firms bought. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yisha paper version and Xiangtai each rose by 20%, shipping and Yinglian Ken Zhi rose by 50%, Yipi steel industry trams telephone industry rose by 10%, and Jardine Matheson rose by half a percent.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks are in Strong Demand, Meiya and Other Stocks are Hitting Limit Up</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were first stimulated by foreign stocks yesterday, and then rumors of margin reduction and deduction rose again, and the buying trend gradually expanded. Meiya rose even more, and miscellaneous stocks Yongye Jinglun Zhongfang Wuhe and Zhabei all hit limit up.</p>
<p>Morning Opening</p>
<p>Rising and falling were uneven. Yongsha opened at 297 yuan for immediate delivery and 303 yuan for deferred delivery. After opening, it once fell to a low price of 292 yuan for immediate delivery and 294 yuan for deferred delivery. After that, it gradually improved. Foreign stocks were extremely profitable, and rumors of margin deductions rose again, and they stepped up to a high price of 313 yuan for immediate delivery and 318 yuan for deferred delivery. Although it had fallen back seven or eight yuan, it finally rose again because there were many buyers who absorbed spot and deferred. The midday closing was 308 yuan and 312 yuan, and the shouts were slightly lower after the closing. Meiya rose more, and the rest were just stable. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Meiya alone rose by 50%, and Yongsha Huaxin Chanbei Xinhuo Hua Feng Xinguang Jingfu Zhongfa Xinyi underwear Zhongs Datong Tongyi Zhongfang Rongfeng all rose slightly, and Qin Xing Xinhua Firecrackers fell slightly, and Jinglun Yonggong was still level. According to the deferred delivery stocks, Meiya rose by 50%, Qin Xing was still level, and the remaining stocks rose slightly.</p>
<p>Aftermarket</p>
<p>It looked good at first, but because there was supply at high prices, the current and deferred Yongsha both fell back to 308 yuan. Although the National Bank's exchange had a difference, it still pulled up to 320 yuan and 324 yuan, and fell back five or six yuan. Meiya's immediate delivery, Yongye and Zhabei all hung limit up, and Jinglun Wuhe Zhongfang also forced to rise to the limit in the chaos and closed the market. Xinyi also rose rapidly, and when Yongsha rose to a high price of 328 yuan for immediate delivery and 330 yuan for deferred delivery, it was sold strongly, and then closed at a price of 327 yuan and 329 yuan. As a result, compared with the morning closing, Meiya Zhongfang Jinglun Wuhe Yongye's immediate delivery stocks hit limit up, and Zhabei rose slightly after hitting limit up, rising by half a percent. Qinxing rose by 10%, Yongsha Xinyi Huaxin Xinguang Jingfu Huafeng firecrackers underwear each rose by half a percent, Xinyi was flat, and the rest rose slightly. According to the deferred delivery stocks, Dongxing rose by 10%, and the rest rose by half a percent.

<h3>The China Trust Will Resume Allocation of Artificial Silk; Yesterday, Weaving Factories Registered; Market Conditions Are Stable on Average, Factory Businesses Are Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Trust Bureau's artificial silk allocation was temporarily suspended due to the non-arrival of bartered goods from Japan. It is now learned that more than 2,000 boxes of artificial silk have already departed from Japan for Shanghai. The China Trust Bureau plans to resume allocation and began registering silk weaving factories yesterday.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Reviews Factory Rosters</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau is extremely dissatisfied with the Central Trust Bureau's method of allocating artificial silk to various silk-weaving factories in this city. Factories that need the silk do not receive enough, while some with larger quotas do not actually manufacture, leading to the phenomenon of silk flowing into the black market. As a result, the Central Trust Bureau has not yet allocated artificial silk and is studying ways to improve the process. The Central Trust Bureau recently sent the list of factories receiving allocations to the Social Affairs Bureau for review. After review, the Social Affairs Bureau found inaccuracies in the listed production equipment of some factories and is continuing its review. However, the Social Affairs Bureau still hopes that the Central Trust Bureau will send personnel to conduct actual investigations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the artificial silk market was quite stable yesterday morning. Although the opening price was soft, the closing price was similar to that of last weekend. In the afternoon, due to the rise in the stock market, people's spirits were lifted, and the final price was 3 million yuan higher than last weekend. No. 120 Asahi Brand Bright Silk opened at 2 million yuan in the morning and closed at 3 million yuan for immediate delivery and 4 million yuan for deferred delivery. In the afternoon, the final price was 7 million yuan, and 4A Toyo Silk approached 90 million yuan.</p>
<p>Raw Silk</p>
<p>Yesterday's market was slightly weak. Although the asking price for Five Bale Head silk remained unchanged, there were basically no transactions. Superior grade silk opened at 67 million yuan, and medium grade silk opened at 66 million yuan, both down 1 million yuan from last weekend. Due to the rise in domestic silk, the Shanghai market became firm and expensive. The price of top grade silk remained around 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics</p>
<p>Yesterday's market was firm and stable. Dachen and Huaqiang real silk quilts opened at 4.5 million yuan and saw transactions. Subsequently, due to short sellers buying to cover their positions, the market rose, reaching a high of 5.1 million yuan for immediate delivery, then retreated to between 4.9 million yuan for immediate delivery and 5 million yuan for deferred delivery. At the close, the price was 4.85 million yuan for immediate delivery and 4.95 million yuan for deferred delivery. Meiya goods were around 5.1 million yuan for immediate delivery, with very few transactions. Prices for other factory goods remained largely unchanged: Huajin crepe was 60,000 yuan, Minsheng floral crepe was 72,000 yuan, and Lin Ji wax-printed gauze was 68,000 yuan. Due to the high price of domestic silk, the cost of Dawei woolen fabric from Huzhou increased sharply, so the Shanghai market price per yard reached around 130,000 to 140,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Credit Tightening</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, due to the settlement of a large batch of sugar payments, credit tightened, especially outside the industry.

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Issues Notice to Grain Merchants Regarding Regulations on Punishment for Hoarding and Profiteering; Hoarding 5,000 Shi or More Is Punishable by Death or Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday issued a notice to grain merchants regarding the following points of attention for operating grain businesses: Currently, the four types of controlled grains are rice, wheat, and flour. "Hoarding and profiteering" refers to non-business persons or non-grain merchants who purchase and hoard grain for profit, or grain merchants who purchase and hoard grain and fail to sell it in accordance with the regulations of the competent authorities, or grain households' surplus grain that is required to be sold by the competent authorities but is concealed or evaded. Hoarding and profiteering will be punished according to the severity of the circumstances: (1) 5,000 *shi* or more of grain or 3,000 *shi* or more of wheat, punishable by death or life imprisonment. (2) 3,000 to 5,000 *shi* of grain or 1,800 to 3,000 *shi* of wheat, punishable by life imprisonment or imprisonment for ten years or more. (3) 1,000 to 3,000 *shi* of grain or 600 to 1,800 *shi* of wheat, punishable by imprisonment for three to ten years. (4) 500 to 1,000 *shi* of grain or 300 to 600 *shi* of wheat, punishable by imprisonment for one to three years. (5) 200 to 500 *shi* of grain or 100 to 300 *shi* of wheat, punishable by imprisonment for six months to one year. (6) 50 to 300 *shi* of grain or 30 to 100 *shi* of wheat, punishable by imprisonment or a fine of 1,000 yuan or less.

Grain merchants who purchase grain and wheat must register and report; otherwise, a fine of up to half the price of the grain will be imposed. Rice, wheat, and flour can circulate freely in various provinces and cities in the Yangtze River basin. Those exporting to various provinces in South China and North China must apply for permission from the Grain Department through legal grain merchants, but the transshipment of flour will be handled in accordance with transshipment methods and quotas.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to strengthen market control and bring buying and selling into order, the Social Affairs Bureau previously convened a discussion meeting of responsible persons from the miscellaneous grain and rice industries to explain the meaning of regional and group liaison management and control, and to review the direction of promoting various industries, which achieved great results. The bureau is continuing to convene discussion meetings of various industries. The schedule is as follows: 4:00 PM on the 25th of this month, a discussion meeting for the flour industry; 2:00 PM on the 27th of this month, a discussion meeting for oil pressing plants; 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month, a discussion meeting for wholesale oil merchants; 2:00 PM on the 29th of this month, a discussion meeting for retail oil merchants.</p>
<h3>Negotiated Cotton Yarn Prices Unchanged; Cloth Fluctuations Narrow; Spot Cotton Stable</h3>
<p>The negotiated prices for cotton yarn by the Textile Adjustment Committee remained unchanged yesterday, and black market prices have already been fixed. The sales agency of the China Textile Company distributed a considerable amount of cotton yarn of various counts yesterday, with prices remaining the same as last Friday, all allocated to various replica manufacturers. As a result, Category B (yarn number) dealers are currently not allocated yarn temporarily.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw firm sentiment at the opening due to the opening price of Fangjian Company being similar to the previous period. Local and out-of-town merchants had some demand, and the market gradually rose. Subsequently, due to tightening credit, fewer buyers entered the market, and some small sellers released their holdings, causing the market to decline slightly. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose 300,000 yuan compared to Saturday, to 39.8 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse yarn also rose 300,000 yuan, and 16-count Guangming yarn rose 400,000 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn rose or fell by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Cloth</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market opened with buyers adopting a wait-and-see attitude, and asking prices were weak. After 10:00 AM, various parties saw the low prices and aggressively entered the market. Dyeing factories purchased a large amount of white greige fine cloth. As a result, 12-pound Dragon Head and other grades of fine cloth rose 12,000 to 35,000 yuan compared to Saturday. Serge and Yuanzhigong cloth fell by 10,000 to 40,000 yuan due to a large supply from Fangjian. Shilin cloth and high-grade Tingshiu cloth rose 45,000 yuan. The market sentiment for other cloths also tended to be firm.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market was calm. Supply and demand were balanced, and prices were similar to Saturday, with little difference. Yarn mills showed strong interest in buying, and owners sold when prices rose. All transactions throughout the day were purchases by yarn mills, with very few transactions among traders. The total transaction volume was 1,760 bales and 200 *dan*. Factory prices opened at 4.315 million yuan for Lingbao cotton, 4.233 million yuan for Shashi cotton, 4.29 million yuan for Shandong cotton, 3.927 million yuan for Sanyuzhen cotton, 3.472 million yuan for Tongzhou cotton, and 3.927 million yuan for Hankou fine cotton. The transaction volume was 1,300 bales and 200 *zu*. The warehouse delivery price was 4.3 million yuan for Lingsai cotton, 3.976 million yuan for Zhangde cotton, 3.555 million yuan for Qidong cotton, 3.968 million yuan for Han fine cotton, and 3.373 million yuan for Tongzhou cotton. The transaction volume was 46 bales, and Zhoupu seed cotton was 710,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Processing Foreign Cotton; Labor Costs Temporarily Calculated According to August</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The total amount of foreign cotton processed in the second quarter was 100,000 bales, which can spin approximately 120,000 pieces of yarn. The delivery will be divided into six installments within November and December. The processing labor costs will temporarily be calculated according to the August rate of 3.8 million yuan. Most of the foreign cotton processed in the first quarter has already been paid in Shanghai, and the payment is being urged in other areas.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the National Economic Council will hold a meeting in Beijing on the 20th to discuss the joint distribution of cotton yarn.</p>
<p>Heavy Woolens Selling Well</p>
<p>Heavy woolen overcoat fabrics, plain heavy woolens, Melton, heavy serge, heavy floral woolens, etc., are all selling well in a timely manner. Out-of-town merchants continue to have demand. Large wholesalers have considerable sales every day, and many direct and indirect transactions take place at tea parties. Plain heavy woolens and Melton in navy blue are selling well, while gray overcoat fabrics are active. Long-haired flannel in dark blue is in demand. Light woolens are popular in brown, while heavy woolens in brown are slow-moving. Although the price per yard is 100,000 yuan cheaper, there are still few buyers.</p>
<h3>Domestic Tea Stable and Selling Well</h3>
<p>Since the shift to main selling intention for red and green teas, the market supply has been scarce. Exports have very little appetite from exporters, and are still seeking low prices. Therefore, the process has tended to be mutually exclusive, and the market is quiet and unchanging. Other domestic colored teas are still being actively sought by buyers due to continued sales from local stores and shops, so the situation continues to be stable and selling well.</p>
<p>French North Africa Purchases Our Green Tea</p>
<p>According to tea industry sources: Yesterday, 950 tons of green tea were traded at a price of US$0.90 per kilogram. This was negotiated and traded by the French economic mission and will be shipped to North Africa. This should be one of the largest recent green tea shipments. However, since it must be shipped out tomorrow, the tea merchants who took over this transaction are all busy packing and loading overnight.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to tea industry insiders, the quality of Chinese green tea is good. It only needs to be improved technically using scientific methods, and exports are not hopeless. However, falling prices in the international market and rising prices in the domestic market in recent years are major difficulties for tea exports.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Continues to Tighten</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw improved sentiment due to rumors of Taiwan Sugar Corporation adjusting allocation prices again. Red and white Taiwan sugar both saw continued tightening, but green sugar was slow-moving and remained flat.

<h3>A Cat's Paradise</h3>
<p>— By Émile Zola, translated by Bi Xiu Shao</p>
<p>After an aunt passed away, she left me an Angora cat, the most stupid animal I have ever known. Look, here's the story it told me one winter night in front of the hot fireplace.</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>I was two years old then, and I was indeed the fattest and most innocent cat one could see. At such a young age, I also had the conceit to enjoy the warmth of the fireplace, which ordinary animals would disdain. Oh, how I should thank God for placing me in your aunt's house! The brave woman loved me very much. In the depths of the closet, I had a real bedroom, a feather cushion. The food was as comfortable as the bedroom; never bread or soup, only meat, good meat with blood still flowing.</p>
<p>But in these gentle moments, I had only one wish, one dream, to slip out of the half-open window and escape onto the roof. Stroking seemed too boring to me, and the softness of the bed simply disgusted me. I lived so happily every day that it finally bored me.</p>
<p>I should tell you that I could see the opposite rooftop from the window when I stretched my neck. That day, four cats were fighting, their fur standing on end, their tails high, happily rolling on the blue-stone tiles in the sunlight. I had never seen such a strange sight before. From then on, my faith was firm. True happiness is on the roof, outside the windows that people so carefully close. What convinced me was that people always close the cabinet doors that contain fresh meat so carefully.</p>
<p>I decided on a plan to escape. In life, there must be something besides fresh meat dripping with blood. This is the "unknown," the ideal. One day, people forgot to push the kitchen window closed, and I jumped onto the small roof below.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>How beautiful the roof was! The eaves, set on their edges, emitted a sweet fragrance. I happily followed these eaves forward, my feet sinking into the soft, infinitely gentle mud. It was like walking on velvet. The sun scattered such good heat that it almost melted the fat on my body.</p>
<p>I won't hide it from you, my limbs were trembling. My joy was mixed with terror. I especially remember a terrible feeling that almost made me fall into the street. Three cats rolling on the ridge of the roof shouted terribly and ran to my side. When they saw me about to faint, they scolded me as a stupid fatso, and they told me they were just shouting for fun. I also started meowing like them. It was very interesting. They were lively animals without my stupid fat. They mocked my clumsiness as I slid like a ball of fat on the sun-baked lead panels. One of the old tomcats was especially fond of me. He voluntarily offered to serve me and take responsibility for my education, which I gratefully accepted.</p>
<p>Ah! Your aunt's pampering was far away! I drank water in the eaves, and never had milk with sugar tasted so sweet to me. Everything seemed very good and kind to me. A female cat, a melodious one, whose beautiful appearance filled me with unprecedented emotion, appeared. Until then, only my dreams had shown me that these wonderful creatures had lovely, soft spines. My three companions and I ran to greet her. Before them, I wanted to express my welcome to the lovely female cat, but one of my companions bit my neck fiercely. I immediately let out a cry of pain.</p>
<p>"Forget it!" said the old tomcat, dragging me away. "You will see many other female cats."</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>After walking for an hour, I felt very hungry.</p>
<p>"What do you eat on the roof?" I asked my friend, the old tomcat.</p>
<p>"We eat what we can find," he replied scholastically.</p>
<p>This answer made me a little bewildered because I searched in vain and couldn't find anything. Finally, I saw a young female worker in the attic preparing her lunch. On the table by the window was a piece of good, blood-red rib meat that made my mouth water.</p>
<p>"Look, my problem is solved," I thought very naively.</p>
<p>I jumped onto the table and grabbed the rib meat. But the female worker saw me and hit me terribly on the back with a broom handle. I let go of the rib meat and fled with a horrible cry.</p>
<p>"So," you must have come from the countryside!" said the old tomcat to me. "The meat on the table is not for us to eat. We can only think about it from afar. We have to look for our food in the eaves."</p>
<p>I could never understand why the meat in the kitchen didn't belong to cats. My stomach had begun to rumble seriously. The old tomcat told me that I had to wait until night, which finally disappointed me greatly. When night came, we could jump into the street and search through the garbage piles everywhere. Wait until night! He uttered this calmly, like an experienced philosopher! As for me, I felt like I was going to faint at the thought of this prolonged fast.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Night came slowly, a foggy night that made me cold. Soon, it started raining again, fine, bone-chilling rain, blown by the fierce wind. We went down through the glass window of a staircase. The street looked so ugly to me! It was no longer the warm heat, the big sun, the bright white roof where everyone could roll so happily. My feet slipped on the wet stone street. I painfully recalled my three-layer quilt and my feather cushion.</p>
<p>As soon as we got to the street, my friend, the old tomcat, began to tremble. He shrank very small, running insidiously along the houses, and told me to hurry and follow him. When he encountered a gate accessible to carriages, he quickly hid there and uttered a satisfied purr. When I asked him why he ran away like that, he replied:</p>
<p>"Did you see that man with the basket on his back and a small hook in his hand?"</p>
<p>"I did."</p>
<p>"Well—if he sees us, he will kill us and roast us on an iron bar!"</p>
<p>"Roast us on an iron bar!" I shouted. "Then the street doesn't belong to us either? Not only do we have nothing to eat, but we will be eaten by people?"</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>However, people dumped garbage in front of the doors. I searched the piles of filth in disappointment. I found two or three lean bones buried in the dirty ashes. From then on, I understood how tasty fresh beef and mutton lungs were! My friend, the old tomcat, swept the garbage with an artistic flair. He made me run straight until morning, visiting every street without any hurry. For almost ten hours, I was battered by the rain, and my whole body trembled. Cursed street; cursed freedom! How much I regretted my prison!</p>
<p>After dawn, the old tomcat saw me faltering and asked me in a strange tone:</p>
<p>"Have you had enough?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Yes," I replied.</p>
<p>"Would you like to go back to your home?"</p>
<p>"Of course, but how can I go back?"</p>
<p>"Come on. Yesterday morning, when I saw you come out, I knew that a fat cat like you was not born to enjoy the spicy pleasures of freedom. I know your house, I'll take you to your door."</p>
<p>This venerable old tomcat said this to me so simply. When we arrived:</p>
<p>"Farewell," he said goodbye to me without showing any emotion.</p>
<p>"No," I shouted, "we can't leave like this. You come with me. We will share the same bed and the same meat. My mistress is a good woman..."</p>
<p>He didn't let me finish.</p>
<p>"Please shut your mouth!" he said suddenly. "You are a fool. I would die in your gentleness. Your abundant life is indeed very good for newborn cats. Free cats will never buy your meaty lungs and your feather cushions at the price of prison... Farewell."</p>
<p>He jumped back onto his roof. I watched his large, thin silhouette, caressed by the rising sun, shivering comfortably.</p>
<p>After I got home, your aunt picked up the duster and beat me heavily, and I happily accepted this deserved punishment. I comfortably savored the warmth and the pleasure of being beaten, and as she whipped me, I sweetly thought of the fresh meat she would let me devour.</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>"You see," my cat said as if concluding, stretching his body in front of the coals, "true happiness—paradise, my dear master, is being locked in a house with meat, even being beaten is happy."</p>
<p>I am speaking for the cat.</p>
<h3>Sketches of the Yellow River Flood Area</h3>
<p>— Li Dinglong</p>
<h3>Notes on Viewing Dinglong's Giant Painting</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jiu</p>
<p>Recently, I went to an art tea party and unexpectedly met Mr. Li Dinglong. After ten years of separation and chaos, we reunited at once, and my heart was filled with comfort beyond words. When I saw the many paintings brought by Mr. Li, I couldn't help but be amazed. During these ten years, he was able to uphold his artistic interests, strive diligently, travel through hardships, and endure hardships, thereby obtaining unexpected gains and achievements, which was by no means accidental. Therefore, I would like to introduce his proud masterpiece to fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>(1) "Thousand Chariots and Ten Thousand Horses": Measuring over ten *zhang* in length, this extremely complex scene depicts the life of more than ten kinds of people, including border compatriots, Kazakhs, Mongolians, Manchus, Tibetans, and Uyghurs, as well as the martial spirit of horse racing, with fluent and skilled techniques, leaving nothing unportrayed. The authenticity of the subject matter and the novelty of the painting show his ingenuity.</p>
<p>(2) "Traces of the Gan River": Approximately seven *zhang* in length, this work reflects the author's experience of the wonders and dangers of the mountains and rivers, and the thorns and thistles of the world, all contained in his heart, expressed with deep emotion, and released from his brush tip and splashed onto the plain silk, seemingly harboring the desire to purify the turbid world.</p>
<p>(3) "Yellow River Flood": This entire area measures over 260 square feet, over ten *zhang* in length. When the Yellow River breached its banks in the 27th year, Mr. Li went to the flood area to sketch on the spot, without fear of hardship. Such a giant work depicting the flood is of the same value as the "Refugee Map" of the rural knights.</p>
<p>(4) "Land of Ultimate Bliss": This painting measures over 400 square feet. Mr. Li spent nine months meticulously copying the Sui and Tang dynasty murals in the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, and the organization and composition of the painting are based on the author's own ideas.</p>
<p>(5) "Phoenix Ceremony": This is an organization of various birds from Mr. Li's sketches, which is particularly unique. The total area is also over 200 square feet.</p>
<h3>An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of White</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>I thought of this mysterious whistle, so I asked Yaoqun if it was used to transmit alarms.</p>
<p>"You've guessed only a small part." Yaoqun laughed this time; probably finding my expression too surprised and nervous, she found it amusing.</p>
<p>"A small part?" I immediately developed an interest in researching it.</p>
<p>"Actually, it's not some amazing new invention," Yaoqun gradually stopped smiling; "Rather than a new invention, it's more like a 'revival'... It's a pity there isn't much time to talk, they might be coming soon..."</p>
<p>"It's okay, at worst..." I couldn't wait, indicating that I wanted Yaoqun to explain this thing, even if just briefly.</p>
<p>Seeing my eagerness for this communication method, Yaoqun asked me, "Do you know that we have a nearly lost vocalization technique?"</p>
<p>"I can't recall it for the moment." I searched my barren mind for a while.</p>
<p>"Whistling: Do you know it?" Yaoqun asked me. Without waiting for me to answer, she continued.</p>
<p>It turned out that the antique dealer, Master Shan, in Laocha outside the pass, had a belly full of the three religions and nine streams of thought (as mentioned before). It was this old antique dealer who taught Yaoqun more than ten kinds of whistling methods. As for the new and old knowledge Yaoqun absorbed, there was quite a lot. She combined the principle of short waves with a type of whistling called "Little Submersion."</p>
<p>According to the whistling score, the "Little Submersion" method "uses the outer tongue to excite, suppress the breath, causing it to rise upward... Because it belongs to yin, the sound is like a ghost's voice, like a dragon's roar... The further away, the more intense..."</p>
<p>"Actually, it's very simple," Yaoqun, seeing that I seemed somewhat unclear, added some explanation: "Good actors in Peking opera are good at using the 'back-of-the-head sound,' you probably know that? The so-called back-of-the-head sound is a kind of sound that is inaudible up close, but becomes clearer the further away... The 'Little Submersion' whistling method is also like that..."</p>
<p>"But just now, when Little Tiger was startled and jumped up, I didn't hear any sound..." I still didn't understand the principle of this mysterious sound transmission.</p>
<p>"The advantage lies in this point." The two small dimples on the corners of Yaoqun's mouth reappeared, indicating a trace of得意得意: a little得意得意的神情:"But the difficulty also lies in this point..."</p>
<p>Yaoqun paused here, as if trying to figure out what words and methods to use to explain this mysterious sound transmission thing simply and clearly: "You know that the strength of the shortwave whistle is that it makes human earwaves unable to feel perception, in other words, it makes people unable to see it, whether nearby or far away. You understand that point, right?...”</p>
<p>Of course I understood this point, so I nodded as a sign, afraid that if I spoke, I would divert Yaoqun's train of thought to other topics.</p>
<p>"Conversely," Yaoqun also nodded, responding to my answer: "The sound of whistling can be heard no matter how far or near; however, it decreases when close by, and becomes more intense the further away. You probably understand that point too?" Yaoqun paused again, meaning to give me time to understand; at the same time, she wanted to get my reply.</p>

<h3>Marriage Journey</h3>
<p>— Sun Yuehan</p>
<p>Fierce as a tiger, rapid as the tide;</p>
<p>A burst of noise passes over the painted bridge.</p>
<p>Vermilion faces unfold into cherry-like mouths,</p>
<p>碧玉 jade hands lightly lift willow waists.</p>
<p>Among them, a person sits by the bridge,</p>
<p>Blood flows all over the ground, his head broken.</p>
<p>His teeth are knocked out, unable to speak,</p>
<p>In October, he only wears a pair of underwear.</p>
<p>Turning around, his roots touch the riverbank,</p>
<p>Passersby whisper the story to me;</p>
<p>This is an old master of a wealthy family,</p>
<p>His wife is out of favor and has no home to return to.</p>
<p>Back then, his spirit was as strong as clouds,</p>
<p>Leather shoes and foreign clothes, standing out from the crowd.</p>
<p>He squandered gold like dirt,</p>
<p>His affections turned towards pomegranate skirts.</p>
<p>When they met in the silk pavilion and red building,</p>
<p>The green willows beside the road became a mess of silk.</p>
<p>Even if only half a face is glimpsed,</p>

<h3>The Honest and Upright Minister - Lu Xuangong, the Anti-Corruption Advocate</h3>
<p>— Tang Shan</p>
<p>In our country's past dynasties, many court officials, like Cai Jing and Qin Hui, relied on power and status to embezzle and bend the law. But there were also many who were honest and upright. These officers of integrity and self-respect could not be moved by gold and silver, nor could they be turned from their steadfast will by favor or grace. They were dutiful and law-abiding to superiors, and did not commit the slightest offense against inferiors.</p>
<p>Lu Zhi (Lu Xuangong) of the Tang Dynasty, who served as a Hanlin scholar, was very favored by the Emperor. Emperor Dezong knew that he was honest and poor, and issued a secret edict, suggesting that he might as well earn some extra money. The imperial envoy who delivered the secret edict said to him: "The Emperor knows that you are too honest and accustomed to poverty. You have refused the things sent to you by various places. If you don't accept large amounts of wealth, it doesn't matter if you accept some things like whips." Lu Xian not only "dared not obey the edict," but also sternly submitted a memorial, saying that "Your Majesty is concerned about matters that are not 通通, which is contrary to reason." The public declared in the memorial entitled "Thanks for the Secret Edict and Discussion of the Proclaimed Matters":</p>
<p>"The clerks and petty officials, slightly escaped corruption, if they violate the Dao, I would know gradually; how about the 公卿公卿大臣 and the 方岳岳岳連帥? How can they be loyal only by bribery? If they are close to the enemy because of the love of wealth and benefit, and can be patient and kind. If we violate the straight way, there must be excessive desires; if we follow it, the laws and regulations will gradually fall, and if we obstruct it, hope will become even greater. The country can rely on it? … …凡上 之 為, 以 導 下 也; 上 所 不 為, 以 檢 下 也. If the superior does not do it, and the inferior does it, then they can set up strict defenses and direct the law. If the superior does it, and the inferior also does it, it is their reason, and can they be prohibited? … …若大臣 邇 臣 可以 受 財, 則 麻 長 案 寮 孰 為 不 可以? If the court takes it from the 方鎭, the 方鎭 takes it from the 州, the 州 takes it from the 縣, the 縣 takes it from the 鄉, then what will the 鄉 take? Once the way of bribery is opened, it will become more and more rampant, not only whips, but also clothes; not only clothes, but also silk; not only silk, but also chariots; not only chariots, but also gold and jade. Seeing what can be desired every day, how can they restrain themselves in their hearts? Once they have a private relationship, it is difficult to sever their intentions. Therefore, the flow does not stop, and the stream of hope becomes a disaster; once a slight difference is made, the hills and mountains gather resentment. How many countries have perished in the past?</p>
<p>I would like to excerpt this large section of the memorial. I feel that these honest words are like a檄文 for the corrupt officials of today. It is not enough for officials to embezzle and bend the law. Even accepting gifts from the people is worthy of consideration. Today's high-ranking officials receive gifts in one place and in another. This is still a变相变相的贪污, because this effect is either媚上媚上 to superiors or褶于威仪. As parents of the people, they receive government salaries and have all the rights. If it is said that "whips" can be accepted, then "gold and jade" will inevitably be rejected. True honesty and integrity must not take anything that is not due to them.</p>
<h3>Talking About Cranes</h3>
<p>— Guangyi</p>
<p>There are many kinds of cranes, but the most rare and valuable is the red-crowned crane. Its whole body is covered with pure white feathers, and there is a tuft of red hair on its head. It is more than three feet tall, with a long beak and head. It likes to eat fish, has large wings and flies quickly, and its call is loud and clear. The Book of Poetry says: "The crane cries in the nine marshes, and its voice is heard in the sky," which shows that the crane's call is loud and clear. It is produced in the three northeastern provinces and Siberia, and migrates to temperate areas in winter and returns to its old land in spring, so the crane is a migratory bird.</p>
<p>Recently (October 2), a red-crowned crane was captured by villagers in Daliang Township, Shunde, Guangdong. Unfortunately, it was injured and died. There was a small copper tag tightly on its foot, with the words "Great Ming Hongwu Liberation of Life" written on it. The handwriting was very faint and could only be recognized after careful identification. It is estimated that the age of this crane is already more than five hundred and eighty years old. Lu Ji's poetry commentary says, "The crane lives for a thousand years." Our human life span is no more than a hundred years. It is impossible to 武断武断地确定 whether the crane's life span can reach more than a thousand years. However, this crane proves that it has lived for more than five hundred and eighty years, which can be said to be long-lived. Today, people celebrate their birthdays and call them "Crane Calculation," and many people like to name them after cranes, such as "Crane Year" and "Crane Age," all hoping to have the same long life as the crane.</p>
<p>I like cranes, I like the 清遠 清遠 and leisurely freedom of European cranes, and I especially like its purity that transcends the outside of產埃埃 outside产埃 so some people compare cranes to virtuous gentlemen and reclusive scholars. When it逍遥在逍遥在问 asking questions for answers, it is carefree in the 青山青山 green water, or soaring in the blue sky and clouds, or standing in the rice fields by the mountainside to peck at food. What悠开自得悠开自得得悠开自得! At the same time, I want to grieve for the cranes that are imprisoned in the cages of animal solids and have lost their freedom. As for the crane that was captured in Shunde, it is unfortunate that it died due to injury. Burning a zither and boiling a crane is too煞风景煞风景 and damages雅雅. Originally, the elegant story of "plum wife and crane son" has been a beautiful story of the past for a long time. What's more, in these turbulent years, no one has such闲情逸致闲情逸致.</p>

<h3>Important Question</h3>
<p>— Hesheng</p>
<p>A child was suffering from a very severe toothache, which often made him unable to sleep peacefully at night, and the sound of his crying really bothered the other people in the family. His father decided to take him to the dentist to have his teeth pulled out. After several persuasions, the child finally agreed. After examining him, the dentist saw that five teeth had been蛀坏蛀坏 destroyed, so he pulled them out one by one. After the surgery, the child felt very strange in his mouth and was very困恼困恼, because he could not chew food. In order to reassure him, the dentist told him that it was okay, and the gums would再生出再生出 to grow. The child heard. He quickly asked, "Can they grow out in time before eating?"</p>
<h3>The Murderous Devil Under Zijin Mountain</h3>
<p>— Bao Qing</p>
<p>In the history of the Anti-Japanese War, the Nanjing Massacre case caused the deaths of more than 300,000 Chinese people, with corpses lying everywhere. The tragedy was so terrible that it shocked the world. In particular, the incident of two demons under Zijin Mountain holding a killing competition was shocking. Koshofu, the protagonist of the massacre case, was executed by our military court in March of this year after his trial was completed. And the two murdering devils also had debts that could not be escaped. After we requested their extradition from the Far East Military Tribunal, they were finally escorted to China on the Suihe Shunlun day from Japan. They will be publicly tried in the Nanjing Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense.</p>
<p>The two murdering devils, each Xiangjing Minming and Yetian Yan, were both second lieutenants of the Pianqiri unit at that time. During the battle of Jurong, they held a killing competition and agreed that whoever could personally kill one hundred people before the complete occupation of Nanjing would win the championship. Later, during the battle outside Jurong City, Xiangjing had killed eighty-nine people, and Yetian had killed seventy-eight people. When the two met under Zijin Mountain, Xiangjing had killed one hundred and six people, and Yetian had killed one hundred and five people, but they could not determine who had killed one hundred people first, so the two agreed not to use one hundred people as the standard, but to use one hundred and fifty people as the standard and continue the competition. At this time, Xiangjing's saber had缺口缺口 chipped because he had killed too many people and used too much force.</p>
<p>Xiangjing is a thorough Japanese Bushido-style militarist. He said that the competition was all "fun," and it was very interesting to break records and not know each other. Moreover, he said that when he put this saber on his shoulder, bullets could not hit him. This is simply the devil speaking.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese not only do not regard DaoRen as brutal, inhuman, or disregard international law, but instead pride themselves on Bushido. Initially, a special war correspondent from the Tokyo Daily News reported to the whole country by special telegram, and the Daily News also published photos of the murderous devil, with the headline "Under Zijin Mountain" in front of the telegram. And the Japanese military headquarters not only did not pay attention to the two 纪纪, but also took photos of the killings to show off their military power. In fact, it was undoubtedly縱兵肆虐縱兵肆虐 and planned large-scale massacres in an attempt to destroy our country's spirit of resistance and national consciousness.</p>
<h3>Going Home</h3>
<p>— Hengquan</p>
<p>I have been away from my hometown for more than ten years. I am tired of living in the city. The environment in the city is too bad, the air is too dirty, and life is too difficult, so I have no恋恋恋恋.</p>
<p>Let's go home soon! Green mountains and green waters,茅屋蓬户茅屋蓬户, fields and streams, melons, fruits and vegetables, how interesting and fresh! Let's sing Tao Lao's Going Home.</p>
<p>The Japanese寇寇 invades our territory, and my hometown is陷陷. My husband and I扶老携幼扶老携幼 to escape to Shanghai. Counting on my fingers, it has been ten years now. In these ten years, my eldest daughter suffered from heart disease, followed by my old aunt suffering from appendicitis, and then my second and third daughters suffering from hemoptysis at the same time. I have been taking care of her for many years, and I have not been able to安枕安枕 yet. There are still two boys who are studying. My inner pain is truly beyond words.</p>
<p>My family of eight all depends on the price my husband换换 with his heart and blood. In the face of high living costs, coupled with the invasion of illness, people can only徒唤奈何徒唤奈何!</p>
<p>Go back! Go back! The繁华繁华 city is not a place for poor people like me to live.</p>
<h3>The Journey of a Cigar</h3>
<p>— Bao Zhongqi</p>
<p>A German luggage porter got a US cigar as a reward for carrying a travel bag for a US officer because the officer didn't have German marks.</p>
<p>The luggage porter, who exchanged labor for food, took the cigar and went to a bakery to exchange it for a loaf of bread with the owner.</p>
<p>Although the cigar was noble, the bakery owner finally avoided its temptation and used it as a price to repair his broken delivery car.</p>
<p>The repair mechanic who repaired the car got the cigar and exchanged it for a new pair of shoes that he had been thinking about day and night.</p>
<p>The shoe salesman exchanged it for eggs at a farmer's house and sent it to his sick brother.</p>
<p>Finally, the farmer was lucky enough to light the cigar. He was the only self-sufficient person and one of the few happy Germans who could enjoy a cigar.</p>
<h3>A Week in the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Li Zhen</p>
<p>"Happiness Rhapsody" Shanghai, the paradise of adventurers, many people rush from different places to Shanghai, which is full of gold. As a result, Shanghai is not the ideal place of gold that they thought, but a city full of fraud, deception, and ugliness. "Happiness Rhapsody" is a script that expresses Shanghai. The playwright brings their dreams of happiness from the characters of Wang Jinfu and Wu Zhihai, a pair of petty citizens. Another Zhang Yuehua is a woman who has been crushed by life, but they all have kind and sincere熟情熟情, so they cannot tolerate this sinful city. In the play, the author writes another rogue character, Jiang Shijie, who represents the dark labor force in this society. In today's rampant rogues, if good people want to survive, they must wait for a true reform of society. Otherwise, at the end, the three of them run away to another place, relying on that set of speculative happiness rhapsody. The result is bound to be a second disappointment.</p>
<p>In today's difficult theme to write, "Happiness Rhapsody" is undoubtedly a good script. Director Chen Liting handled the war very appropriately, always grasping the development of the play, especially the清新格调清新格调, which is his consistent style.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, Gu Eryi is the best. Huang Zongying and Zhao Dan performed very appropriately. Huang's造型造型 is better, and Zhang Ming can be called stable.</p>
<p>The recording of this film is poor.</p>
<p>"Thinking of the Mortal World" Among the Western films this week, "Thinking of the Mortal World" is the best. It depicts the lives of a group of Catholic nuns. The beauty of the photography方面方面 is indeed one of the best among recent British films. Deborah Kerr's nun is the best actor, and Keen Summon's native woman and大术术术德勒德勒De Di恩Di恩 are also satisfactory.</p>
<p>At the end of the film, the male and female protagonists bid farewell to each other in the torrential rain. The melancholy感情感情 shows the director's skill.</p>
<p>"Loose Woman's Infatuation" This is a good Hollywood-style多角恋爱多角恋爱 film, starring Hedy Lamarr. The story顿为平庸顿为平庸. Hai蒂蒂蒂拉玛拉玛 is good in her performance. Yuehan Leide, who plays the jewel merchant, is not weak.</p>
<p>"Spring in the South" With the scenery of South America in Brazil as the background, it is interspersed with South American music and singing as a gimmick. The story is an American-style love story. If you watch too many such films, you will definitely feel厌腻厌腻. Especially in terms of performance, it is simple and lacks excitement.</p>
<p>"Valley Heroes" This film depicts the western film of heroes and beauties. Large groups of horses gallop in the mountains. It is completely粗鑛粗鑛 style, but the technique is too old. It seems to be an outdated work.</p>
<h3>A Sketch of the Kingdom of Yemen</h3>
<p>— Gao Ming</p>
<p>——She is a new member of the United Nations</p>
<p>Yemen, a new member of the United Nations, is located at the southern end of the Red Sea, which has been a major sea route for thousands of years. She is a country that relies primarily on trade, but still retains a unique ancient culture in her plateau regions.</p>
<p>Nearly five million people live in the country of 75,000 square miles. It is the most fertile region of Arabia, and in fact is the only part of the Near East with abundant and regular rainfall.</p>
<p>Yemen's current ruler is伊受葉耶伊受葉耶, who is the King of Yemen. He is the spiritual and political leader of the Yemeni people, and he claims to be a descendant of Muhammad's son-in-law, Ali.</p>
<p>In Yemen, there is an area of about 25,000 Jews, and besides Palestine, this is one of the oldest Jewish societies.</p>
<p>The lineage of伊曼葉耶 has continued for more than a thousand years. Beginning in the 16th century, she was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, and the original ruling class was replaced by the latter. It was not until World War I that the Turks were expelled, and the current伊曼 restored his position as ruler. In 1934, she signed a treaty with Britain, confirming her southern border with Aden; in the same year, in another treaty, she stipulated her northern border with Saudi Arabia. To the east of Yemen is a barren sandy desert, where she has no clear border lines.</p>
<p>In recent years, Yemen has concluded agreements with many countries in trade and other aspects. These countries include Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, Egypt, Belgium, and others. In 1945, she joined the Arab League.</p>
<p>It is said that coffee originated in Yemen. For hundreds of years, Yemen has exported many fine varieties of coffee. Even today, Mocha in her south is a port for coffee exports. As early as the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company had set up a station in "Mocha" to engage in coffee trade. By the 18th century, the word "Mocha," regardless of its origin, was used as a synonym for high-quality coffee in Western Europe.</p>
<p>Coffee, fruit skins, and raisins are the main items exported from 集门 to more distant countries, while cereals are exported to neighboring countries. She is self-sufficient in food. Yemen's famous craftsmen are silversmiths, and sword casting is their specialty. Their works are famous in the East.</p>
<p>Yemen has no railways, but there are highways linking important towns. These highways have been gradually improved, and now cars and camel caravans can pass through them.</p>
<p>Sana is the capital of Yemen, with a population of 60,000, paved with neat streets, surrounded by twenty high and extremely thick city walls, with eight gates running through them.</p>
<h3>Retreating Island</h3>
<p>— Gongsun Neng</p>
<p>The United States also has</p>
<p>The Spring and Autumn Annals says: "Six castings retreated and flew, and meteorites fell in Song." In fact, the United States also has this legend.</p>
<p>Kansas, the proudest state in the United States, has a strange story. It is said that there is a Jayhawk in Kansas that can retreat and fly, so it is "无往而不利无往而不利". A historian in the state also researched and said: "This divine bird has protruding eyes, and when it flies, it looks in all directions with one eye."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association’s Reply to Tuberculosis Patients</h3>
<p>To the correspondent: Your esteemed letter, along with the original letter from Mr. Cui Huimin, have been received and noted with respect. The reply is now provided as follows:</p>
<p>The former Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Shanghai Branch previously provided skim milk and cod liver oil to our association's First and Second Tuberculosis Hospitals each month for distribution. Monthly reports were prepared and submitted to the branch and the Social Affairs Bureau for record. However, the branch ceased issuing these items from the end of February this year.</p>
<p>Although the UNRRA Shanghai Branch stopped providing these nutritional products from the end of February, our association continued to distribute the remaining skim milk and cod liver oil according to the original plan until they were exhausted.</p>
<p>The skim milk was completely distributed by early October.</p>
<p>There is still some cod liver oil remaining, which is currently being distributed. Each patient receives 45 cc per month, also until the supply is exhausted.</p>
<p>For those requesting cod liver oil, whether new or returning patients, they must still follow the original procedure of personally visiting our hospital's outpatient department for an X-ray examination and must bring their own container.</p>
<p>Outpatient X-ray examinations are subject to fees according to the hospital's regulations, but those who are poor and ill with proper documentation can receive them free of charge.</p>
<p>The UNRRA Shanghai Branch completely ceased its external operations by the end of May.</p>
<p>Last month, the United American Committee for China Relief donated a batch of bulk nonfat dry milk to our association. All tuberculosis patients in our outpatient department can receive two to five pounds free of charge. Respectfully, Huang Jia, Executive Director of the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association, to the Social Services Section of the Shen Bao Newspaper.</p>
