<h3>東北共軍派系各異　林彪將被迫下台　聶鶴亭因內訌已被暗殺</h3>
<p>〔中央社長春五日電〕東北共軍份子複雜派系各異，雖均在林彪指揮下，而吉黑·吉遼·熟遼·遼東等軍區部隊，各有其獨曰發展之歷史與背景，對於林彪之指揮，時在依違兩可之間，在橫的關係上，各軍區間更難有融洽之連擊，自去歲四平街戰役後，東北共軍每次攻勢均遭失取，其原因即在於此，此次林彪發動廿五萬之衆，進犯長春，兵力不謂不厚，然熟遼野戰軍區部隊於進抵萬寶山後，正面德惠迄不能攻下，各路共軍均不肯攻堅，治國軍布署反擊，共軍又不肯堅守旣得據點，亙相觀望，致彼國軍各個擊破，現共軍各高級將領問，均懷有歧視，林彪將有被迫下台之說。</p>

<h3>吳鐵城在滬招待記者　談解決時局途徑　改組政府先中央後地方</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕吳秘書長鐵城，昨在記者招待會上稱：解決目前時局問題，不外兩個辦法：一為用政治方法求取和平，一為以軍事方法求取和平。因中共之堅拒和談，提出無法接受之條件，自閉和談之門，故政府今日只能用軍事求和平。過雲中共一貫宣傳國民黨不要和平，但時至今日，人民不難看出誰為和平之破壞者。兵凶戰危，言之深可痛心！至於內戰何時結束，，本人非軍事家，不敢有所推測。記得周恩來說過：戰至今年六月，雙方可勢均力敵，然後方可有合理之和平。中共見解如此，人民痛苦深矣！</p>
<p>關於政府改組事，則政府希望兩黨能早日參加國府委員會及行政院，但因意見尚未一致，故目前尙在滬緻商。政府希望改組事能儘速於三月十五日完成，國府委員會與行政院同時改組。兩黨所佔之席次，報紙所載大體正確。改組之程序為先自中央，再至地方。靑年黨因地方上黨員較多，故其要求參與地方政府，乃當然之事。在國民黨而言，在野黨僅參加立法　監察院等四個機構而不參加國府及政院，尙不能謂組成過渡之政府，共同負責，結束訓政，完成黨政。</p>
<h3>政府改組時為民盟留額</h3>
<p>政府要求中共辦事處人員之撤退，乃因在三月五日以前，可得美機運送之便利。至於警備司令部函件中所指出之各點，則為「地方的理由一。今後政府對於民盟之態度，全視民盟對負國家實任之政府之態度以為斷。在政府改組時，焉民盟留有空額，歡迎其參加。實屬仁至義書。外傳對於某部偽人士有不利行動等等，本人可負實答覆，悉為毫無根據之謠言。又北平接近前綫，四郊即有共軍出沒，故有大搜索之舉。上海情形不同，無此必要。</p>
<p>經濟緊急措施方案已公佈，但必須執行得力，如有在事實上行不通者，要變通辦理，如發現毛病須即刻改正，希望此一方案實行時，能得人民之擁護。</p>
<p>吳秘書長表示：此次米滬，一為敦促民社青年兩黨常委赴京商討改組政府事宜，二為家眷自美返國，特到滬迎接。至於祝壽之舉，在此戰亂未息，民生憔悴之際，不敢稱觴，本人預計數日之內，即可返京。</p>
<h3>改組政府有進展人選職務即決定</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕洪蘭友頃對記者談政符改組事稱，如民社·青年兩黨能迅速提交名單，改組之事十五日前決可完成。又悉，目前已進至國府委會製政院改組之各額與部會之分配問題，民社黨人員抵滬後，即將集會商討決定。青年黨人士六日晚曾應洪蘭友宴，有所商談。又青年黨決定參加社會·敎育兩部一事，政府與靑年黨兩方人士似均未予否認。民社黨則可能出長經部。至政院院長一職，目前尙無確切決定性之商談。民社黨方面人士表示，不應由主席久兼政院院長。至張君勳之參加政院一事，據政府及民社黨雙方表示，可能性極小，因張本人堅決表示不參如也</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕陳部長立夫巳於昨日搭十一時之夜車返京。行前　記者：此次來滬會聽取工商界之意見，重點在生產方面，須俟閱京整理後，方能發表。</p>
<h3>民社黨開中常會</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕民社黨於昨日下午在範圍舉行中常會，由赴京常委報吿接治經過，並廣泛交換意見。因等待常委伍憲子·李大明來滬，未作具體決定。據蔣勻田吿記者，政府對責任內閣制已同意，對於行政院對立法院負責一點，在原則上亦不反對。關於開放地方政權，民社黨之見解與靑年黨並不完全一致，民社黨所注重者，為地仿上行憲之機構，例如辦理選舉之機構等等。民計黨要求之重心，在參加之人數能發生作用，及參加以後能有政績表現。至於參加國府及行政院之席次問題，目前所傳者為過去政府所提出者，須視參加方面之多少，而決定民社黨是否同意。</p>
<h3>孫連仲赴保　主持改組綏署</h3>
<p>〔本報北平六日電〕孫通仲定七日晨赴保，主持十一戰區長官部改組保定綏署。</p>
<p>〔中央社北平六日電〕第十一戰區長官部改組為保定綏靖公署，在積極進行中，長官部頃正式發表綏署人事，由孫長官連仲任綏署主任，副主任三人，由陳繼承，上官雲相及馬法五分任。</p>
<h3>市黨部歡迎會席上陳部長述國共關係</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中央組織部陳部長立夫蒞滬後，上海市黨部特於昨日上午九時假亞爾培路市立體育館舉行歡迎會，計到吳市長，方主委，宣司令，吳局長開先，顧局長毓琇曁市黨部全體委員，各區黨部，各直屬區分部委員及黨員代表共三千餘人，陳部長由方主委，宣司令陪同蒞塲，全體鼓掌歡迎，首由方主委致詞介紹，旋即請陳部長致訓，略謂：「今天兄弟與上海市黨部各級幹部以及一部份黨員同志在此見面，感覺非常高興，因為時間倉促，無暇與各位同志個別談話，現在趁此機會，提出幾點意見，與各位一談。</p>
<p>從容共到清黨</p>
<p>我們總理領導同志從事革命，推翻滿淸，建立民國，認為要建設國家，首先就要完成統一，如果疏忽了這一點，國家就要倫於萬刦不復的境地，當時有兩個力量，一個是中國國民黨，一個是中國共產黨，革命力量如不集中，是危險極了，國家必然弄得四分五裂，因此，在民國十二年與列寗的代表越飛將軍，發表聯合宣言，說明中國的革侖事業需要統一，中國需要的是三民主義，共產主義不適合於中國的環境，這一宣言的發表，其目的在使一切力量都能回到國民革命的陣營內來，因此，而有民國十三年本黨的改組，把所有共產黨的份子容納到本黨來，我們要注意的是，當時共產黨的份子都是個別的參加，不是團體的加入，本黨為了要統一國家而委曲求全與共黨合作，允許他們個別加入，不料他們加入以後，違反諾言，專門搗亂，阻撓革命的進展，因此，忍無可忍，只好聽其離開，而有十六年的淸黨。這一事件的發生，在本黨言，不是快集，而是很悲痛的，由十六年到二十五年，十年的詩間，彼此鬥爭，兩方面都犧牲很大，所以在中日戰爭尙未爆發的時候，我們又與共黨進行交涉，使能集中力量，一致對外。抗戰發生後，中央依據我們所提的條件，於二十六年九月二十一日發表共赴國難的宣言，承認中共軍隊服從蔣委員長的指揮，三民主義為抗戰建國的中心信仰，取消所樹立的蘇維埃政權，停止暴動，抗戰期間，雖然中共沒有為國家盡實力，但是我們所希望不要阻撓抗日的目的，總算達到了。我們只要中共不為日本人所利用就够了，為的是表示我們的國家是統一的，能够一致對外，抗戰結束後，我們要加緊事國的工作，更需要統一，使國家經過八年的生死鬥爭後，從此長治久安，走上民主的道路，我們要實現軍隊國家化，政治民主化，不惜採取種種的方法，如政治協商，和談，一切都是忍氣吞聲，希望建立一個統一的國家。國家必須統一，才有光明的前途，我們所以忍人所不能忍容人所不能容，不是為了黨，完全是為了風家，使國家的建設工作能够完成。但是一年多的努力，完全失敗了，無論是停戰命令，整軍方案，以及政協決議，都為中共破壞了，最後中共且悍然關　了和平之門，到上月為止，和平已趨於絕望，不得不轉入一個新的階段，就是請他們轉回延安，總之，我們過去的容共，清黨，以及前此的和談，一切犧性，一切容忍，都是為了國家。</p>
<p>踏進新的階段</p>
<p>然而，今天事實吿訴我們，本黨對中共一切的希望，都失敗了，本黨不負中共，而中共確實負了本黨（鼓掌），現在我們又關始踏進一個新的階段，這個階段是很艱苦的，中共份子雖然表面上是走了，在上海方面說，只走了卅四個人，你們相信上海的中共份子，就只有卅四個人嗎？由此可知，各位今後的責任是非常重大的，一面要努力本身的工作，一面要能做到感格共產黨人，自動的覺悟過來，使他們也有民族國家的觀念，那就是我們同志最大的成功。但這並不是難事，因為中共根本的弱點，是把人當作工具，把一般靑年弄得連國家是什麼都不知道，我們知道，有些青年雖然不滿現狀，但是青年決沒有不愛國家，不愛民族的，而中共的根本　點，就是沒有國家民族的觀念，前年毛澤東到重慶時，他來看我，問我為什麼反對共產黨，我當時吿訴他，三民主義實現，能使次殖民地的中華民國變為獨立自由民主的國審，共產主義如果成功，頂多由次殖民地的中華民國，變為殖民地的中華民國（鼓掌），我這幾句話，各位同志可以轉吿每一個青年，抗戰以後，青年的愛國思想更加熱烈，我們只要去積極接近，積極說服，就是已受過共黨麻醉的人，在很短的時間內，必能一個個回到三民主義大蠢之下。總之，今天唯一的前提，是君我們的力量是不是國結一致的，看我們的組織是不是眞是嚴密。總裁昭示我們，現在的時代，是科學的羣衆時代，科學是什麼，國父說，「科學者，分門別類之學也」，我們每一個同志的責任分明，每一個時間支配妥當，每一個空間運用適宜，每一件事物處理合法，就是合乎科學。現在是一個鬥爭時期的開始，能不能够成功，就看所用的方法是不是科學的方法，行動是不是離開了羣衆本位，孫子兵法吿訴我們，不戰而勝是上策，我們要加緊宣傳的工作，使遺留的共黨份子覺悟過來，回到三民主義的陣營內，希望各位伺志以最大的自信與熱誠，來完成我們的使命。</p>
<p>積極凖備行憲</p>
<p>今年元旦已經頒佈憲法了，十二月二十五日就要開始行憲，由訓政到憲政這個過渡階段，我們各種方式都要改革，詳細辦漲，將來三中全會自會討論。總之，我們的言論行動，都要格外檢點，我們每一個同志，應該提高警覺性，應該提高工作的積極性，研究如何改進工作的技術，我們要把區分部看作學校，看作一個研究機關，改正自己的短處，我們現在已由防禦中的應付階段，進到由進展中爭取的階段了，希望各位同志本着過去光榮的奮鬥歷史，適應時代的需要，以最大的決心與努力，來完成賞前的艱鉅的使命。詞畢，方主委復勗勉全體同志，恪遵陳部長訓詞，黽勉努力，並介紹宣司令致詞，宣氏指出建國期間應以實行民生主義為急務，而目前上海市民所需要者，則為「安定第一」，希黨政通力合作，安定大上海，詞舉，至十二時許散會。</p>

<h3>台灣秩序已趨正常　政府決心改善政治　陳儀向臺胞廣播懇切闡釋</h3>
<p>〔中央社台北六日電〕由台北查緝私煙案而引起之台灣紛擾事件，連日經長官公署及各界代表之合作處理，社會秩序日趨正常，關於懲兇撫恤等善後事宜，業已分別辦理。今日上午十一時，陳儀長官復接見民眾代表蔣渭川等十二人，對今後施政，作進一步之檢討。陳氏當場宣佈，政府改善政治之重大決定，會議至十二時四十分方結束，（內容見陳儀廣播詞）與會代表均感滿意，并表示當勉勵全省同胞一致切實遵行。</p>
<p>〔中央社台北六日電〕陳儀長官今晚八時半向同胞廣播，全文如下：台灣同胞，自從「二二八」台北事件發生以後，我曾兩次廣播，宣佈極和平的解決辦法，台北方面這幾天經　　及地方人士的全體努力，秩序已安定。曾經有過問題的各縣市，亦趨好轉，想不久可恢復原狀。不過各位所關心的還有一個問題，就是如何改善政治，但要改善政治須先調整人事。關於這一點，我也考慮到，此刻特將我的意思和你們開誠佈公約說一說：第一，省級行政機關，我已考慮將行政長官公署，改為省政府，向中央請示，一經核准，即可實行。改組時省政府的委員，九廳長或各處長，要儘量任用本省人士，希望省參議會及其他可以代表民意的合法團體，推舉人格高尚思想正確能力卓越的本省適當人選，以便向中央推荐。</p>
<p>第二，縣市級行政機關，我已預定和預備手續能完成的條件之下，定七月一日開始舉行着　直接的選舉民選各縣市長，至於縣市長未民選以前，現任縣市長之中，當地人民認為有不稱職的，我可以將其免職，另由當地縣市參議會，各合法團體，如要參加，亦可由當地人士協商決定。總之，希望能代表多數民意，共同推舉三句人選，由我國定一人充任縣長市長，并負責辦理民先縣市長的準備工作；人民認為稱職的現任縣市長則繼續執行任務。至於各種行政如何改革，在省一方面，俟政府改組以後，由其決定，在縣市方面，俟縣市長調整後由他們負責。</p>
<p>政治問題，我已決定如此解決，但是目前最重要的還是趕快恢復秩序，否則奸黨可乘機搗亂，極易　爛地方。今日下午，還有坐着卡車在路上搶奪士兵槍支的不法之徒。就是糧食問題，現已日趨嚴重，現在因為秩序未定，米價黑市聽說已激漲至六十多元，一般人民不受影響生活，痛苦極了，又聽說台灣大學學生已經吃了幾天稀飯，我都非常關懷。你們要知道，目前的糧荒，這全是秩序不定造成的，要解決糧荒，須趕快恢復秩序。</p>
<p>我聽說因為奸黨造謠惑眾，致有同胞遷避的，我希望你們信賴政府，萬勿輕信謠言，中華民族最大的德行，就是寬大，不以怨報怨，我們對於本省自己的同胞，難道還會不發揮寬大的美德嗎？我今天下午已經召集本市公教人員講過話，要他們發揮我們中華民族寬大的德性，忘記這次悲痛的事件，與本省同胞相親相愛，精誠團結。</p>
<p>同胞們：政治問題解決的原則，我已經告訴你們，只要辦法決定，即可實行，從今以後，大家趕快鎮定下來，協助政府，恢復秩序，解決糧食問題，準備改組省級政府及民選各縣市長，言而有信，我的話完全負責，在這次沉痛的經歷以後，希望政府人民共同爭取安定·繁榮·愉快·和平的生活。</p>

<h3>下關江堤繼續崩裂　數處碼頭均已垂危　工務局集中全力搶修</h3>
<p>〔本報南京六日電〕下關江堤繼續崩裂中，且有擴大之勢，京市各方對此極為重視。第三號碼頭塌陷後，第四第五二碼頭亦復呈危象，市工務局刻正停止一切普通工程，集中全力，實地勘察水力水位及岸基情形，并即從事搶修，惟預計需工程費十億元，市府無力負担，擬呈請政院撥發。據下江水鬼稱，三四處碼頭一帶地下均已空虛，可直達江邊房屋之下，設不亟予搶救，預料沿江房屋不久即有塌沉危險。又據航政專家談，當局如不在此江水枯落時期迅予修建，夏水暴漲時，江邊一帶可能成為澤國。此外十號碼頭亦已垂危，隨時有傾陷之虞。前市長馬超俊六日晨曾往視察，市參議員李棠等對滲案責任問題，已提會研究中。</p>

<h3>上海金潮調查報告　續昨</h3>
<p>金價變動原因分析</p>
<p>第二，金價變動原因之分析：我政府向美借款，其中一部份購運黃金五百萬兩，黃金政策開始運用，其用意原在緊縮通貨與平抑物價，乃以執行政策者措施失當，而執行業務者疏誤不察，遂使情弊叢生，黃金政策結果適獲其反，此金價變動原因一也。</p>
<p>握有大量法幣者，皆不從事生產，而以牟利為唯一目的。上海為全國金融集中地，全國游資爭先會聚於斯，所調游資之作崇，大戶之操縱，乃屬自然現象。今以通貨膨脹，大量法幣并併於少數豪富豪富之手，或以黃金為投機，此原因二也。</p>
<p>自中央宣佈補貼辦法後，進口項目減少，於是外貨形成居奇之　，而黑市物品增多，動輒以黃金交易，因欲囤積外貨，遂不得不爭購黃金，此原因三也。</p>
<p>上海銀行錢莊林立，類皆不作生產事業，而從事商業投機及高利貸，購金在所難免，此原因四也。</p>
<p>上海工人工資過高，去年舊曆年底，各工厰分紅及賞金，即在五千億以上，持有此大量法幣者，大都爭購黃金，至年關數日間各銀樓購金者累累，此原因五也。</p>
<p>去年底政府即決定對滬上各工厰發放生產貸款，核准者共三百一十四家，貸款共計六百五十五億餘元，市面驟增此鉅量法幣，不以之從事生產，而利用以作投機，為害市場，此原因六也。</p>
<p>近來頗多軍政機構，利用緊急支付令，或其他藉口，及用其他手段，在滬提現，挪用公款，從事商業投機，買賣黃金者有之，此原因七也。</p>
<p>上海各銀行錢莊押款多遠規章，以黃金美鈔一萬萬元，金條二萬條，運用法幣，從事投機，擾亂市場，而年終各行莊結算，收款甚鉅，亦有從事購金者，此原因八也。限制外匯供給法公佈後，各申請外匯者，往往僅獲核准半數或其一部其餘聽其自籌，故各商不得不向市面自行搜購黃金美鈔，此原因九也。</p>
<p>共黨造謠煽動，其在蘇北等地將糧食豬牛等農產品運滬，專購黃金，上海方面，此類企圖更多，而滬上報紙亦間有登載黑市金價，以助長金潮者，此原因十也。</p>
<p>二月八日前數日，央行突然中止暗　而九日起又突然停止明配以致四日至八日逐漸增高，九日後扶搖直上，況達九關，人民皆以為央行黃金已罄，爭購益多，且市面是時發現漲厰金條，信心愈失，原因十一也。總之法幣膨脹，信用動搖，而時局不靖，造成人民心理恐慌，皆不欲身藏法幣，兼之舊曆年關，央行忽發行五千元及一萬元大票，事先諱莫如深，不使人民瞭然其發行政策，因是人民爭相拋棄法幣，藏之於物，藏之於金，其勢必然，此又為金價變動之內在因素也。（下接第三版）</p>

<h3>港立法議會將修改　官方議員減少二人華委規定三席　楊慕琦主張市參會議員華人佔半</h3>
<p>〔中央社香港五日電〕港府發言人今晚宣稱：根據倫敦殖民部大臣在下院所作之聲明，香港將修改市立法議會，原有官方議員九席，將減至七席。按該聲明稱：英政府已接受港督楊慕琦與香港當地各社團代表商議後所作之決定，即香港政府應在可能範圍巾，以最廣泛之代表為基礎而組成。并謂：大部分議員將由選舉產生，并逐漸担負所有目前中央政府所負責之任務。港市府範圍，將包括九龍在內，九龍境以外之新界，則不在內。至修改目前立法議會之組織方面，則將自非官方社團中選出較直接之代表，并依比例遞增，官方議員則將由九人減至七人，而非官方委員八人中，其中三人為華人，二人將由市參議會直接推定，香港總商會及非官方保安官各指定人，餘數則仍由港督指定，但關於擬議中之市參會組織，則未見提及。華人佔香港人口大多數，究否能獲有為數較大之代表，尚不得而知。楊慕琦氏曾提議市參議會委員四十八人中，半數由當地華人充任，但此種建議被攻擊，認其不公平。</p>

<h3>送中共人員返延安</h3>
<p>居留京滬渝各地的中共人員，今日分別乘美機飛返延安了；這不能不說是今年國內政治上一件大事。滿腔和平熱望的我們，曾為和平團結民主的遠景而歡笑，今天中共工作人員撤返延安，我們除以友好的態度敬盼他們旅程平安外，對於他們的歸返不無慨嘆！</p>
<p>國共兩黨的關係，微妙複雜，盡人皆知。而亂絲愈理愈亂，和平愈談愈遠，竟至今日彼此關係暫告斷絕，究其原因何在，當然是非各持一說。可是共黨拒絕和談，近更否認國民政府之法律地位，究為和平大門完全關閉的原因，則毫無疑義。依我們客觀所見，關於和平談判一事，本有成功的希望，其所以破裂的緣由，係政治協商會議當時，未將東北問題作有效的解決，雖有去年一月十日的停戰決議，仍不免有東北接收權的爭執。政府依中蘇協定有權去接收東北，而共黨則近近水樓台搶先侵占長春哈埠及鐵路沿綫，遂迫使去年一月廿一日第一次停戰令破產。五月二十三日國軍收復長春，關內共軍乃做戰略上的進攻，藉以策應東北。接着軍調部又忙了很久，軍事休戰談判始有頭緒，六月二日復有二次停戰令。詎料爭點又轉在關內共軍的比例，及共軍撤出熱察及蘇北各項問題上。談判復談判，蹉跎復蹉跎，國軍於七月三日收復了張家口，同時頒佈國大召集令，以為軍事可告一段落，希冀回復政治談判。其間經過美方馬帥和司徒大使，國內其他黨派及社會賢達的奔走，十月十六日，蔣主席發表了解決時局的八點申明，十一月又頒佈第三次無限期的停戰令，冀以掙得共黨參加國大的代表名單，結果和談又擱淺，到十一月十九日周恩來等撤返延安，而大勢已定。馬帥與周氏分別時，曾以各綫全面停戰重開談判之建議，請延安考慮；十二月六日周復馬電，認為只有現在召開的國大立即解散，并恢復一月十三日停戰令以前的軍事位置，一切談判才可重新開始。此一表示，目的是從精神上瓦解國大，打擊政府信用，并破壞憲法的價值，問題顯然愈趨複雜了。</p>
<p>今年一月八日，馬帥離華返美，發表聲明承認停戰失敗。這時大局已到山窮水盡，一般觀察家咸認少有希望挽回，而政府仍力謀僵局的打開，一月十五日政府通知司徒大使請轉告中央，政府擬派張治中氏携帶和談條件飛延，結果延安於十七日正式宣佈拒絕；廿日政府的四項聲明，但中共仍拒絕接受。時局演變至此，各綫軍事轉趨激烈，美政府即宣佈中止其對三人小組之關係，接着軍調部宣告結束。這是一年多來，政府追求和談而共黨拒絕和談的經過事實。</p>
<p>和談大門雖已關閉，然中共工作人員仍留京滬渝各地，似乎國共都靜觀大勢，而彼此間的政治關係，若仍藕斷絲連。政治本來是現實的，祇要主觀客觀的努力，和平之門似未嘗不可重開。無如中共二月二日突在延安發表炸彈性的聲明，否認去年一月十日以後，國民政府對外一一談判，借款租借及通商航海一切條約的效力，且強調中共現在將來均不承認，并不擔負任何義務。這個聲明的性質是荒謬絕倫的。國民政府乃合法的政府，早有國際的承認，決無國際承認而國內反對黨否認的道理！反對黨奪取政權的方式，合理的民主的手段，是選舉的競爭，政策上宣傳上的鬥爭；非理的手段是暴力革命，斷無以此方式而粉碎政府的法律地位。所以共黨這一聲明，在國內外毫無反響，徒增開明人士的嘲笑而已。可是這一聲明的副作用，便刺激了一個合法的政府，加以各地共軍加緊攻擊國軍，儼成敵國，因此二月廿八日政府遂有請中共人員撤退的措施。此一措施，似為政府對共黨所施的對策，而中共與政府斷絕關係的決意，則早見於二二的聲明。這是中共政策上造成的不幸，也是國共和平團結前途的不幸，實在令人懮慮前途的演變。</p>
<p>關於中共人員的撤退，人們均以為必然的趨向，故國際間亦無任何的驚訝。至於京滬渝中共人員的撤退。事實上，中共恐亦未必願意撤退所有潛伏的黨員。其他地方不說，姑以上海而論：據中共所提名單，計思南路一〇七號周公館十七人，朱葆山路新華日報十七人，凡明眼人當能想知上海中共人員決不止此卅四人。此種撤退法，顯然是有兩種相反的作用：由於中共幹部撤退倉卒，僅撤退卅四人，而將其他黨員拋棄。果如此，則中共對黨員的責任感似太不夠，未能盡撤退保護其黨員的義務，此其一。或中共有計劃的保留潛伏的黨員，於國共關係斷絕後仍取秘密活動方式，準備在行動上與政府有所敵對。果如此，則人民的安寧，社會的秩序，必將受政治秘密鬥爭的威脅；水流濕，火就燥，將來的情勢恐有不可想像者。因此，希望政府方面，能調查登記上海和各地的中共黨員，思想信仰應準其自由，而行動則不準其影響安寧秩序，并要保障人身的安全。如果政府一進放任，不作適當的處置，得過且過，則不幸發生任何的變亂，將來人民受了損害，或中共黨員失了法律保障，政府當局的責任是難諉卸的。</p>
<p>總之，今天是國家撥亂反治之機，一切都不可亂。國共永久的和平團結，為我們熱烈所希望。在今天，國共關係暫告斷絕的今天，不能不重申我們的意見。對政府方面，希望仍殫精竭力，追求和平之實現，有一分希望，作一分的努力。對各黨派及社會賢達方面，希望仍能尋求有利的時機，一面從速參加政府，一面設法將和談僵局打開，而重建和平，對中共和撤返延安的中共人員，希望正視政治的現實性，不要以情感為政策之決定，開誠布公，放下武器，仍為未來的和平前途作最後的最大的努力。「往者不可復兮，冀來今之可望」，我們對國家現況雖十分懮急，但瞭望着燦爛明霞的遠景，國家前途漸殝治理，實有無限希望的，願共勉之！</p>

<h3>馬歇爾昨抵巴黎　與法當局舉行政治會談　留宿一宵定今日經柏林續飛莫斯科</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕倫敦六日廣播：馬歇爾今午十二時四十分（格林威治標準時間，上海時間下午八時四十分）飛抵巴黎飛機塲。馬氏將在巴黎小作勾留，輿法總統歐禮和·總理賴瑪迪作政治性會談，因外長皮杜爾已前往莫斯科，故馬氏將與代理外長德仁商談。據法方稱，員爾納斯會於上年四月廿九日建議簽訂四强公約，保證德國在盟軍佔領結束以後解除軍備廿五年，法國現亟欲明瞭馬氏對此建議之態度若何，馬氏是否仍願繼續進行該項公約之簽訂。馬氏定於星期五自巴黎飛往柏林，並在週末前飛往草斯科。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎六日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾今午十二時四十分乘專機到達此間奧萊機塲。取道前往莫斯科。國務院高級官員數人同來，美駐法大使卡弗萊及法國駐美大使扉萊等均在機塲歡迎。馬歇爾向報界談稱：「此行迅速，趕在預定時間之前。余重游法國與法政府人員有接觸之機會，衷心欣慰。或以莫斯科會議為問，馬卿僅謂，在發表意見之前，當靜觀局熱發展，馬鄉一行下機後，即驅車前往美國大使館休息。法內閣總理賴瑪油於馬卿抵法之日發表歡迎詞稱：「馬歇爾將軍來此作客數日，吾人不勝榮寵。馬帥為共同勝利最偉大的締造者之一，法政府自當盡力報答。就吾法國人而論，馬帥非僅為一個盟國之代表而已，渠乃法國解放的締造者之一，今明兩日吾人自當以最光榮之方式，表示感戴，所惜馬帥留此日期太短耳」。法總統歐禮和定當晚在總統府接見馬歇爾。</p>
<p>〔路透社巴黎六日電〕據馬卿專機上之芝加哥論壇報記者稱，在法總統之宴會席上，馬卿將與法政府領袖談及英漲及漲蘇之同盟關係，法國且可能以技巧的方式，建議與美國成立類似的盟約。美前國務卿貝爾納斯去夏曾向法方有此提議，為法方所拒，今外交局勢已與去夏不同，故法政府或願提出此事。</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕英外相貝文等已於今日下午專抵柏林，星期四午刻可抵華沙。波關政府業已邀請貝文外相在華沙停留數小時，俾得一觀該城戰時被毀之狀况。貝文抵柏林時能者曾詢以此去莫斯科有幾時勾留，貝文答曰約數星期，詢以希望如何，則曰竭其成功。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎五日電〕法國出席四外長會議之代表團，於本日午後三時十三分由皮杜爾外長率領，乘坐專車自此啓程前往莫斯科。德境法軍總司令柯恩尼格將軍則將自柏林逕往蘇京</p>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦六日電〕自華府起飛赴莫斯科四架飛機中第一架飛機，其中共載有美代表及新聞記者共廿四人，由於柏林機塲為電霧籠罩，費時四十五分仍無法降陸後，被迫飛回荷蘭亞姆斯特丹。</p>
<h3>外長會議工作艱巨　能否完成對德和約仍屬懷疑　馬卿離國前發表談片</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕國務卿馬歇爾今日已首途赴莫斯科，出席外長會議，行前對會議能否完成對德和的，公開表示懷疑。馬氏促請全世界人士勿過存奢望。渠希望對奧和約可在莫斯科擬就，但能否解決對德和約之更大問題，則認為「極可懷疑」，職是之故，今年以後或將舉行第二次外長會議，就打破美蘇對德和的問題之僵局，再作嘗試。又法國新聞社訊，美外交政策專家即共和黨員杜勒斯亦隨同馬歇爾國務卿前往莫斯科，據其向報界談稱，數百萬人民在戰時犧牲，而其理想繼續存在，吾人旣倖免於死，自負有一種神聖之責任，即尊重彼等之最後遺囑與遺言，在彼等之理想中締造和平。吾人前往莫斯科，將竭力達成此一目的，但為欲獲得成功起見，吾人尙需要美全國人民在精神上為吾人之後盾。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社倫敦五日電〕晚報頃載稱：英外相貝文在莫斯科會議時，將堅持對德和會，應在倫敦舉行，預料對德和會將在四外長會議就對德和約獲致協議之後，再行召開。</p>
<h3>蘇波成立借欵協定　波捷公約將簽字</h3>
<p>〔合衆社紐約六日電〕據莫斯科五日晚廣播，波蘭總理薛萊基維資，業已與蘇聯簽訂一項達二千八百八十五萬美元之借款協定。該廣播又稱，蘇聯又同意對軍事供應品及配備，貸予波蘭作信用借款。該協定中其他條款，包括波蘭對運煤入蘇，减少百分之五十，將蘇聯戰利品中之鐵軌及機車交還波關，以及在五月十五日，將波蘭應得之德國商船交還。又據紐約報載，波京華沙之消息，謂波捷防止德國朱來侵略之互助公約，將於莫斯科四强會議之前夕〔九日）在華沙簽字。據此間推測，此項公約，所以趕速進行，乃在完成斯拉夫各國之條約綱，由此可在四强會議開會時，出現一堅國之斯拉夫陣錢。雖此一條約名為友好公約，但捷波關於在希特勒侵犯捷克波希米亞省時為波蘭攫得之產煤豐富區德申之爭執問題，現仍未解決，該公約因此對邊境閒題未經特別現定，顯然其的東祇限於德國侵略，而決非一正式軍事互助公約。</p>
<h3>駐希英軍暫不撤退　英覆文送達華府</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社華盛頓六日電〕此間官方宣布：英政府昨已通知美國謂不擬在近期內即行撤退在希臘駐軍，并表示美國倘願共負對希臘之責任，則英國凖備接受美國之援助云。</p>
<p>〔路透社華盛頓五日電〕國務院發言人稱：英政府答覆美國務院關於援助希臘之照會之覆文，業已收到，該發言人不願透露覆文內容，僅日杜魯門總統將就援助希臘問題發表聲明。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕政府要求立刻在軍事與經濟方面援助希臘之事，已於本日引起國會方面之反對，國會將要求杜魯門總統發表關於希臘問題幕後事實之詳細坦白聲明。參衆兩院之發言人對於國務院自行決定協助英國處理棘手之希臘問題，而並未詳細解釋此對於美國傳統上之不干涉政策有何影響一節，均加以抨擊。　　　訪問墨西哥返國後　杜魯門發表演說　提倡國際貿易自由　　〔法國新開社墨西哥京城六日電〕美總統杜魯門訪問墨西哥事舉，頃於今晨五時卅分乘坐飛機返美。總統昨日乘飛機在普里扣丁火山上空遊覽，該一火山僅於四年前聳起，現在活躍中。午後總統復在此間北面的四十哩處，參觀印地安人金字塔及托爾蒂克寺院。</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社美國德克薩斯州華哥城六日電〕杜魯門總統今日在此間培樂大學接受名譽博士學位之後，發表演設稱，過去所得之重大敎訓，已證明和平自由與世界貿易互相關聯不能分離。美國對此抱有一種決心，將以種種方法實現國際自由貿易。聯合國問現已以談判方式解決政治爭端，則經濟爭端亦應循此途徑加以解決。吾人與國外之政治與經濟關係，皆屬不可分離，吾國尤為經濟世界之巨人，不問吾人對此作何感想，將來經濟關係之形式，終必惟吾國之馬首是瞻。職是之故，吾人可以使各國走入經濟和平之途，亦可使之陷入經濟戰爭之中。美國人民重視自由更甚於和平，美國生活方式乃私人商業為主體，即此之故。以言舉比各國政府管制對外貿易一事，若不改變此趨勢，則美國政府在此壓力之下，亦即將使用同樣之方法，以爭奪市塲與原料，但此為戰爭結束後吾人所欲避免者。余對於聯合國之國際貿易機構計劃，寄以極大之希望，美國對此當創議進行談判，以减低關稅及取消限制措施，下月日內瓦即將召開會議，討論此一計劃深望其不致失敗。實行自由貿易之後，輸入品勢將增加，但美國對此可無需憂懼，要知在兩次世界大戰之後，孤立主義在道義及精神上皆已宣吿破產，締造和平與自由自非輕而易舉之事。端賴各友好國家在政治及經濟上互相諒解，信義合作，始克有濟。</p>
<h3>英下院熱烈辯論　印度問題</h3>
<p>克里浦斯為政府辯護</p>
<p>〔路透社倫敦五日電〕下議院於今日開始舉行為期二日之印度問題之辯論，前使印內閣代表團代表之一商務大臣克里浦斯爵士代表政府首先發言，表示英國政府之決定於一九四八年六月以前退出印度，使印度領袖得乘此時機捐棄成見，成立諒解，實已抵達最後而危急之階段。此項決議對於英國，印度以及全世界均有影響，不失為冒險之舉，然英政府相信此乃唯一正當的途徑，而值茲急迫時期，實已不容繼續猶豫。克里浦斯稱，英內閣使命團之第一件任務，即為向印人表示英國之誠意。英政府認為可循之途，計有兩條，或為加强英國對印之控制，增加英軍駐印兵員，直待印度內部得有完全協議時為止，但此舉勢須使英國繼續留駐印度至少十五年至二十年之久，必致引起印度各方面之反對，事實上難以實行。另一途徑即為以一定限觀通知印度，在期限以內，繼續保持英國對印之責任，促使其成立協議。限期旣屆，不論印度內部有無協議，英國即行退出。印度各派若能在制憲議會及臨時政府中誠童合作，在尊重相互權利之原則下，制定適合各族各敎之憲法，始能避免內戰，發展資源，以利向印以及其他一切稱族。保守黨議員安持森爵士代表反對黨首先發言，指責政府有兩大錯誤，一為在未獲得有滿意的憲政解決以前，遽將行政權力移交代表機構。另一更大的錯誤，即為確定期限咬出全部政權。此一措施，足使印人在期限內抱觀望熊度，以待期限屆滿後，可以為所欲為，無所拘束。安特森旋動議睛下議院拒絕接受政府之限期退出印度之決議，該動議將於明日表決。</p>
<h3>英王出巡南非火車一節出軌</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社南非王家專車六日電〕英王出巡南非所坐專車之供應軍一節，昨夜九時突然出軌，有無死傷及損失情形均不詳。</p>
<h3>美致蘇照會　抗議蘇對匈行動</h3>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕美國務鄉馬歇爾乘機赴莫斯科前之最後外交行動，據悉，厥為其於今夜以嚴峻之照會致蘇，抗議所傳之蘇聯曾干涉匃牙利非共黨政府一事。國務院迄今為止，關於此項消息並無說明，但據悉，照會曾促使蘇聯注意，美國認為匈牙利現在之「小資產」黨派之政府，由「自由與不干束縛之選舉」中產生，乃為合法統治團體。該照會據信，曾攻擊蘇聯企圖損害「小資產」政黨，而有利於匈牙利共黨，並堅決表示美國認為匈內閣為少數中歐政府中能眞正代表人民政府之一。</p>
<p>國務部此次照會，正如自去年三月一日以來之各項照會然，攻擊蘇聯拒絕與英美談判一「三方面」之援匃計劃，此實有意違反雅爾趣協定。</p>
<p>蘇聯從未對前兩次實施雅爾達諾言之努力，有所答覆，但美國繼續援助匃政府，以便直接建立一健全與政治基礎，美早與匃成立信用借款關係，借款總數達三千萬美元，使匈政府獲得陸軍剩餘物資。同時美政府並抗議蘇聯移去匃國機器及以過重之賠款加諸匃人。</p>

<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕朝鮮南部美軍司令靈奇，現在此間與國務院及陸軍部商談朝鮮問題，今日宣稱，渠深信可在朝鮮創造一東方最民主國家。獨立之渴念正奔騰於朝鮮人民心中，此固其生命之一部份。截至目前為止，美軍尙未自蘇聯獲得合作，完成朝鮮統一，但相信此種合作即將來臨。蘇聯若深知美軍有國內人民為其後盾，且美軍此來並非欲覇佔世界，而係追求一更趨完善之世界，則蘇聯當能與美軍合作云。</p>
<p>全國一心求達目標</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓五日電〕接近李承晚方面之朝鮮人士今日自漢城由「朝鮮美國新聞社」發出一電訊稱：「朝鮮各政黨現對獨立計劃，意見更趨接近，而全國俱在等待臨時政府組織之消息」，此一電訊中，引證金九之談話，謂任何朝鮮人，皆為朝鮮國家解放之最後奮鬥而忘其政治上之黨派。金九又稱，一致輿情，厥為「吾人不諭其屬於右派抑左派，抑共產黨人抑民族主義者，所有人民如祇要能達到統一與獨立，皆願犧牲一切」云。</p>
<h3>對美管制原子能計劃　蘇代表再施抨擊　舊調重彈堅主締結公約</h3>
<p>〔合衆社成功湖五日電〕隊聯特別反對國際經營或佔有各地原代表葛羅米柯今日在安理會中，對美國管制原子能計劃，發動新攻勢，第一次明言蘇聯担心美國之計劃，乃干涉蘇聯內政之企圖。葛氏率直指斥擬賦與國際管制機構無限權力，干涉各國與原子臺無連帶關係之經濟方面之內政。葛氏首次反對美國所提國際發展原子能和平時期用途之建議，子能動力廠之建議。葛氏並稱，「巴魯包之草擬計劃，根本漢視其他國家之利益，且圖以各國之利益附屬於美國一國」。蘇代表復謂，蘇聯極力贊成國際嚴格管制原子能之必要，誠如史達林於去年十月間答復合衆社社長貝利之問題時所明白宣在者。葛羅米柯今日又重彈二月來之老調，堅持原子能實際管制之第一步驟，厥為締結「禁止原子武器之使用，製造及存貯」之協定，然後再討論管制事宜。葛氏並稱，此點僅為漢蘇管制計劃中基本衝突之一而已。葛羅米柯至此，並操英語抨擊美國之管制及調查計劃，及其國際原子能發展組織普遍調查原子能應用之計劃。最後葛氏並稱，美國之計劃僅可視為美國獨覇原子能之企圖云。</p>
<h3>愛因斯坦　後悔發明原子彈</h3>
<p>〔法國新聞社紐約六日電〕大科學家愛內斯坦敎授頃在本期「新聞週刋」發表一又，討論原子炸彈，路謂：原子炸彈之秘密，現在成為美國人的「馬奇諾防綫」，此一訪綫給予吾人想像上的安全，其危險實大。全世界防止原子炸彈之方法，惟有曉諭公衆以原子炸彈萬一再度應用時之恐怖，而自相警惕。余倘若早知德國人不能發明原子炸彈，則余將不為原子彈出力矣。</p>
<h3>荷印扣美商船　美向荷抗議</h3>
<p>〔聯合社華盛頓五日電〕國務院今日向荷蘭政府提出抗議，反對荷印之出口限制條例，美國商船「裴爾門」號即因此項條例而被扣留。該船自爪哇之東印共和政府轄境裝載橡膠等物一批開出，被荷蘭海軍扣留。美國抗議聲明該出口條例不僅對鎖荷印貿易，且剝奪全世界之必需品，尤以食糧為甚。「裴爾門」號或其船員所受損失，美國政府保留一切權利。</p>
<p>荷蘭答復</p>
<p>〔法國新聞社海牙六日電〕美國為貸船「裝爾門」號被扣向荷蘭政府提出抗議後，荷關政府頃發表聲明，謂此次扣船，依照最近頒佈之條例行事，目的在保護自東印度購貨之外國人，尤其是美國人之利益。</p>

<p>〔法國新聞社巴黎五日電〕法內閣本日決定以軍事勛章，授與達香里歐海軍中將，預料述氏將偕新任高級專員波拉特前往越南，辦理移交。波拉特現任法共和議會犧員，因不願辭去議員之職，故於六個月後必須返國。</p>
<p>〔聯合社巴黎六日電〕法國今後處理越盟事件方針，已引起猜測，以下數項發展，頗堪注目：（一）據政府方面稱，達氏之免職，因其政策缺少彈性，不足以恢復越南之政治安定。（二）公報中首次提及叛變行動已蔓延至越南西部。（三）越盟提出之軍個和平條件，即撤換達香禮隊及召回萊克婁克，均已由法方履行。波拉特雖未奉與越盟談判之命令，且不願考慮越方所提和平條件，惟觀察家則認為有此可能。</p>

<h3>上海金潮調查報吿　上接第二版</h3>
<p>金價變動責任分析</p>
<p>第三，金價變動責任乙分析：黃金政策及其業務之執行者，為宋子文。貝祖詒·林鳳苞·楊安仁等四人，宋貝為政策之決定，而林楊則為業務之實施，至其還用及置賣眞相，在本年一月前，為央行主管機關之財政部，亦未得任何報吿，惟貝等每日對宋以英文詳細報吿而已。　黃金政策，目的在緊縮通貨，吸收法幣回籠，同時法幣為法定之通貨，而黃金為貨品，為商品，非貨幣也。今則黃金已為交易營利對象，已為實際之貨幣，黃金早已失其為黃金政策之重心，向以黃金換取法幣，今則以法幣換取黃金，黃金愈少，法幣愈多，政府已不能再以少量黃金，控制大量法幣，而法幣乃至泛濫，永無回籠之望，宋子文不預為計，停止黃金政策，使黃金脫離貨幣關係，回復其原為貨品之地位，乃至演成今日經濟危機，使投機者獲利，而國家人民皆蒙其害，此金價波動之責任為宋子文所應負者一也。</p>
<p>黃金政策執行之責任，旣如斯重大，而執行者又為中央銀行總裁貝祖詒，該認裁應如何詳細審訂週密計劃，然一攷其內容，則其漏洞重重，情弊業生·黃金明配暗售辦法，皆無明文規定，而關於配售之機構，竟由貝與林楊任意指定五家金號銀樓，僅憑一已關係，漫無標準，而業務執行之決定，則竟旁落於副局長楊安仁一人者為多，是其在政策執行上，為極大疏忽，此金價波動責任為貝祖詒所應負者二也。</p>
<p>央行執行黃金政策，目的旣為法幣回籠，平抑物價，則當以壓制金價為唯一任務，今則央行執行之實際情形，不獨遺忘其目標，一意跟隨黑市，且有迎頭趕上領導黑市之嫌，結果力竭技窮，使黃金暄賓奪主，成為法幣與制價之控制者，此金價波動責任為貝祖詒所應負者三也。</p>
<p>金潮已一再表現其危械早已潛伏，則央行決定在滬公開買賣之際，即應針對市塲情形，考慮在全國各地同樣分配，勿使此地價高，彼地價底，啓投機市塲之漸，今則黃金配售，使一切投機之不合法者，因黃金投機之合法化而合法，因是業務執行者與商人之勾結圖利。在極度便利之條約下，易於形成，此金價波動責任為貝祖詒所應負者四也。</p>
<p>二月八日以前，央行中止暗售數日，而市上同時發現渝廠廠條，導起漲風，蓋人民以為央行金罄，爭相購金，八日僅配售一日，十日突公佈停配，事出倉卒，因之一日而金價數易，竟逾九關，其於八日前後之突停，實與投機者以刺激，事實具在，此金價渡動責任為貝祖詒所應負者五也。</p>
<p>央行對執行此項業務手續，毫無固定辦法及明文規定，悉由貝林楊三人自由決定，以前中請手續，早經廢止，而明配暗售，全憑三人指定之五家金號及銀樓包辦，旣無契約，又無憑據，悉以五家對講電話作為決定，黃金政策如是重大，黃金投機獲和機會，又如是廣泛，乃竟草率粗忽，毫不顧及，此金價變動責任為貝林楊三人所應負者六也。</p>
<p>五家金號銀樓之選舉，完全憑與貝等三人之關係，漫無標準，而五家之資本，在同業中並非全雄厚者，何獨有愛於同豐餘一家而畀以重任，至同豐餘號股東詹蓮生，僅佔該號十五中之一股，乃央行一切借重詹蓮生一人，同豐餘為詹所介紹，一切央行委託分配鎔化與配售，均集中於同豐餘，五家領金繳款，皆由詹經手，且須經其簽名蓋章，一切由其負總賣，因是配售同豐裕亦最多，名雖五家，實際有支配權者，僅同豐餘一家，且僅詹蓮生一人而已，央行配售後，絲毫不問莫分配如何，售價如何，似此操縱控制情形，不待智者而後知，此金價變動責任應由貝林楊負之者七也。</p>
<p>自一月四日至二月十五日停售止，央行委託五家配售七九四四零條，同豐餘佔數最多，竟逾半額，而同豐餘於政府宣佈停止配售前半小時內，突大量購進金條，市價乃更飛漲，顯係事先聞風，從事操縱，執行業務者與同豐餘之間，不免有特別默契之嫌疑，此金潮波動責任應由林鳳苞，楊安仁負之者八也。</p>
<p>關於與五家對講電話決定配售數量及價格者，以楊安仁為最多，有時且僅向同豐餘一家，即作決定，且銀樓業市價，決中於金業市價，金業市價，復決完於詹蓮生與楊安仁之對話，此金價波動責任，應由楊安仁負之者九也。</p>
<p>央行列報一月四日至二月十五日之配售金條數字，與五家賬條所列配售條數逐日各有不同，總數亦有出人，而掌管黃金，買賣行情紀錄者為楊安仁，此金價變動責任，應由楊安仁負之者十也。</p>
<p>五家配售賬目中受戶有央行同人多筆，就中如管理黃金庫賬而知存金底數秘密之　理王松濤，亦列有購買金條賬目，此金價波動責任，應由楊安仁王松濤負之者十一也。</p>
<p>上列各節，委員等此次奉派澈查黃金風潮一案所悉之情形，除與此某有關人員其違法失職部份分別提請糾彈外，特此報吿敬祈鑒核。（全文完〕</p>

<h3>高橋警局一股長　貪污嫌疑候訊究</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕高橋警察分局第二股股長曹彥文，近被警局督察方祖緩檢舉，謂曹曾向陶春生。王文生敲詐，有貪汚行為。經總局派員調查後，全案移送地檢處繼續偵查。據警局之調查報吿書謂，負責調查人員曾傳訊陶春生與陶黃氏，據稱：去年八月間曹彥文指陶春生收買贓物，帶局拘押，勒索法幣一百十萬元，始准保釋。賄款係交該局値日室一姓雷者收受云云。訊據曹彥文稱：因當時有吳淞海濱飯店經理楊嗚奎呈控陶春生，王文生盜竊其飯店中浴缸長橙等物，故傳陶王二人到案訊聞，後以罪嫌不足，即令交保，絕無扣押勒索情事。但謂値日室中有一一姓來名秉炎之雇員，恐即陶春生所稱之姓雷，現此人已離職，檢察官將追緝訊辦。</p>
<h3>跑馬廳債券案　被告上訴審結　被上訴人提出反訴　要求以三千倍償還</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕跑馬廳債券案經地院民庭判決以一千借償還後，跑馬廳總會法定代理人樊克令，不服向高院上訴，昨日開庭。樊克令之代理律師蔡文達向庭上陳述上訴理由，的分四點：（一）戰前債券一千倍償還之判決，能刺激物價上漲。（二）政府現正謀收縮通貨，抑平物價，法院如判戰前債務增加給付，則更促進通貨膨脹。（三）跑馬廳發行債券，用以償還債務，而非用以生產，故與存款不同，且目前業務停頓，不勝千借償還之負擔。（四）戰前幣制與戰後幣制，政府並未承認有任何變更，故未便增加給付。被上訴人狄百斯等三人之代理律師當庭提出附帶反訴，謂該案地院宣判時美匯僅三千餘元，今已一萬二千元，要求以三千倍計算償還。辯論終結後，庭論十日宣判。</p>
<h3>新海軍的搖籃　海軍軍官學樣準備遷青島　現有學生一百八十六名　四年畢業以少尉銜任用</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕目前全國正有一百八十六個靑年，受海軍方面之最高敎育。此一學府即現在高昌廟之海軍軍官學校。亦為中國唯一的新海軍之搖籃。預期三十八年署假期內，第一批新人，將可正式加來之新中國海軍陣容中。</p>
<p>上海之海軍軍官學校，甫成立於去年夏季，其訓練方法以及一切配備均為美國式。惟最近已奉合準備遷往靑島，此事於本年署期中或可實現。因此該校原定之種種措施，不得不因而擱置，靜待遷往靑島後，再事擴充。美國方面曾協助此一海軍軍官學校建立七個試騐室及一個實騐工廠，關於此項機機已陸續集中青島，預料將來之海軍軍官學校，在中美合作之下，可望發揚光大，為朱來之新海軍奠下一良好基礎。</p>
<p>海軍軍官學校直屬於海軍總令部，投考程度以高中畢業及同等學力者為合格。年齡規定十七歲至二十歲，因海軍方面對體格有嚴格之要求，故患近視眼；色盲及沙眼等症者，俱在淘汰之列，全部學程共分四年，其時間相等於普通大學。將來學成後，分派各監工作，列為少尉階級。目前在校學生，除供給衣食住外，每月並津貼四萬五千元。</p>
<p>過往學生省籍，以廣東福建佔居大多數，惟去年以各省交通不便，保送學生不易，故因地理上之關係，而以浙江佔居苜位，湖南江西次之。</p>
<p>最近當局又計劃再設立一海軍軍官速成班，收容曾在抗戰期內派赴英美實習之海軍士兵及靑年軍之優秀份子以及戰前曾在海軍學校畢業之學生，重使集中訓練，完成其全部學業，而為未來之新海軍造成統一的基本幹部·惟此事亦須待海軍軍官學校還往靑島後，始可繼之成立。</p>

<p>女子組雪白戰女靑紅，王慧玲張秀麗相繼獲六分時，女青紅方由曾昭靑罰中一球，第一節從此無所得，對方則劇增至二十比一</p>
<p>。第二節女靑紅徐靜雲在雪白三十分時擲中一球（三十比三），上半時雪自四十二比三大勝。</p>
<p>第三節小將們數度傳球進入籃底，獲利而返、吳民爵允見靈活，乃由三分加至十二分，是節五十六比十二（雪白十四女青紫九分）。末節已成强弩之末，吳漢蓮碰痛額角，鐘聲鳴時，七十六比十四終塲。</p>
<p>春茂勝全黑</p>
<p>春茂李賢政鄭家彪上塲即中三球，全黑賈幼良罰中後，張少卿二擲命中，形勢接近（九——八），上半時春茂廿三，全黑十一分。下半時全黑宣通替賈幼良，全黑隊員每賽輙零落，且常有新人演出，春茂以李賢政最活躍，全黑宣通陸大振尙努力，最後一分鐘，雙方有滑稽表演，引起哄笑，結果為四十六比二十八。</p>
<p>汕隊勝仁餘　汕隊佔先</p>
<p>仁餘與汕隊之要，汕隊同立德初罰球失機，不久連擲二球，以四分獨覇，仁餘沈鵬舉還敬一球，得二分，迨汕隊林維驢罰入，沈又中一球，（五比四）仁餘沈鵬舉罰進，打成各五平手。此時沈鵬舉與何立德為雙方爭而子，九比七時，仁餘暫停，汕隊馬燦希奪球得法，與陳淸江蔡演離三人，平添六分，成十六比十，因有關錦棵，競爭極烈，十七比十，仁餘又暫停，商戰略，又被淸江殺入，上半時汕隊十九比十佔先。汕隊後衛稱職，而前鋒投籃又較仁餘幸運。</p>
<p>急起直追</p>
<p>下半時仁餘梁永佳出戰，姚文　遲中三球，沈　舉王槐庭亦神對·分數驟增廿三比廿，汕隊僅領前三分，乃調紀蘭康入替林維總，蔡演雄罰中廿四比二十，仁餘梁永佳長驅直入，居然成功，廿四比廿二落後僅二分矣。看台間各有所好，喊聲震天，一分鐘後梁再中，成廿四平手。（尙餘五分鐘）裁判宣吿四分鐘時，孫國政罰出，徐仲已入替，汕隊兩次罰球未中（林，何），萬分可惜，仁餘吳新還調出徐仲巳，當時祇有廿秒鐘，最後一剎那，姚文彝中錢遠投未中，鐘響時，成廿四分各無勝負。</p>
<p>延長時間</p>
<p>延長時間五分鐘決勝，林維驢治右邊穿入，中空心球，乃欲穩扎穩打，以渡過光陰，蔡演雄搶沈鵬舉球，被判犯規，沈中差一分，吳新運罰球未中，可惜可惜，最後汕隊僅以一分勝利，為七比廿六五分。</p>

少。今市加拿大白報紙每令十二萬元，橫對開白報紙十萬五千元。凡利根白打字紙每令十六萬五千元，透明紙每令已跌至一百卅萬元。其他各紙亦一致下游，土產價格站立原價，一時尙難者低。洋莊紅茶　昨有少數成交　　專供內銷之紅綠茶，邇來始終呈平靜狀態。原因為去化零而乏聱，故人心尙未能向榮也。洋莊茶市仍以珍眉·針眉·等綠茶，問津者仍未歛跡，市勢則以供求相　，亦鮮榮辱。他若英莊注視之紅茶，昨日市上，晟開之初各不遷就，情况殊為黯淡。俄而突有一部份亟求頭寸之貨主，紛紛出籠，交易乃豁然開朗，惟成交數量依然不多。全市僅午昌茶葉公司及仁記洋行，微有交易，售價方面較隔日稍露軟化。發展輸出貿易問題　　沈熙瑞星五演講　　中央信託局副局長兼輸出推廣委員會秘書長沈熙瑞氏，定於七日中午，應本市金融界及工商界領袖組織之星五聚餐會之邀請，講演關於發展我國輸出貿易問題，按此次政府為謀國際收支平衡，挽救入超危機，特設立輸出推廣委員會，力求我國對外輸出貿易之發展，沈氏兼理該會會務，供獻頗多。美國桐油產量大增　去年產桐子四萬七千噸　　〔合衆社波斯頓五日電〕基督敎科學　世報頃載稱：美國之桐油產量將造成新紀錄，已經種植之桐樹的計一千二百萬株，據晨業部發表之統計，美國於一九二四年所收穫之桐子不足一噸，一九四三年已達六，一〇〇噸，去年產量竟超過四七，〇〇〇噸，為五十二項主要農產品中發展最速之一。自四七，〇〇〇噸之桐子中可提鍊桐油七，〇〇〇噸，約等於美國本年度油漆業需要量三十分之一，亦即戰前中國桐油出口赴美之十分之一。據稱：中國之長江流域，漢口至宜昌段，年產桐油約十五萬噸，戰爭爆發以後，中國桐油出口遂吿停頓，在日本八年之佔領下，新植桐樹為數無幾，而舊桐樹則採伐殆藎；故目前桐子產量銳减，中國國內需要股切，在數年之内，勢無大量出口之望云。</p>

<p>新醫與新藥上海市醫師公會主編偶感一則  范守淵　　一般常人，與我們醫師，在心理觀念上，對於這一項診治疾病的醫藥，時常是不相同的。　　一般常人，對於診病的觀念，總以為醫師跑來，一視即明，一度診察之後，即有屬何病症的確切診斷，交代出來。醫師的本領，賽渦張天師，醫師的兩顆眼珠，就是顯微鏡。用藥呢，不消說得，什麼毛病用什麼藥品，不是藥到病除，也得藥進病减，是理所應當的事。　　反過來，醫師對於診病，對於用藥，便沒有這樣簡單了。輕易診斷的病症，經過一度的診察，即有珍斷，即知其為何症的，固然很多，而且是平常的事；診察十天八天，而診斷仍然茫然莫測，莫明其妙的，亦屬不少，並非稀罕。　　論到用藥吧，在沒有診斷的診視期山，只有等待，沒有特殊的對症藥品應用，固然理所當然，即到診斷明瞭，病情清楚之後，往往亦不必用何藥品去治療，也並不失為合理的處治哩。因為處治疾病，並不專恃藥品，需用藥治時，應用了藥，始能見藥的功能。不需藥療時，即不宜用藥；多用藥品，或反有　病體。　　但，一般病人，對於診病用藥，總多不能與醫生抱同一的觀念，總多是存着一種與我們醫師不同的心理。　　一般常人的這種醫藥觀念，實在有取消掉，革除掉的必要。　　因為，這種對於醫藥觀念，是極不合理，極違反科學的，對於病人的病體，只有妨害，沒有益處。痘的免疫問題  余雲岫　　什麼呌做免疫？這裏應該交代一下！疫就是流行病，就是傳染性的毛病，像天痘，痳瘏，霍亂，鼠疫，傷寒等等，都是傳染病，也可以都呌做疫。免疫是免生流行病，碰着傳染性的病，毒來侵犯的時候，有個抵抗，不感受汙潰，這就是免疫。像世俗所說出了天痘以後，終身不會再出，發了痳瘄以後，終身不會再發，生了傷寒以後，終身不會再生，注射了霍亂菌苗以後，可以免生霍亂，痘黃接種以後，可以免生天痘，這點都是免疫的事情。　　現在單單講痘的免疫；痘有天痘，有人工接種的天痘，有人工接種的牛痘。天痘俗呌做天花，是自然傳染來的痘瘡，人工接種的天痘，是用經過良好的痘瘡的痂，來接種在小兒身體內部，敎他傳染而發生痘瘡，自明朝的末後的時代起，到牛痘接種盛行以前，狠用這個法兒。現在則都用人工接種牛痘。我要寫的話，是三種都有牽及，有的說天痘的免疫，有的說人工種天痘的免疫，有的說種牛痘的免疫。　　一，感受性　　感受性，就是流行痘毒來侵裂的時候，我們身體感應接受而被傳染的事情。簡單點分做三項說：（甲）胎見有被傳染性；假如懷孕的婦人害了天痘，在胎中的胎兒，也會發生天痘。不單單這樣，母體對於天痘若是還有抵抗力（免疫力）的時候，痘毒進了母體的血液裏，母體雖然不會發痘，而血中的痘毒，能够通過胎盤，（俗語呌做胞蒂）而使胎兒出痘。（乙）初生兒也有被傳染性；的霍曼氏Jo　chimann己經報吿過一例，說：「誤信初生兒不必要種痘的近鄰，發生了天痘，他們就闔家種起牛痘，只剩着初生兒不給他種，結果，閱家平安，只有這初生兒，傳染天痘而死，做了痘子鬼。此外某產科醫院，生出以後的小孩，當時給他種痘，共六百四十二名，都出得狠好，（我們呌做善感）只有兩個小孩給他反復接種，（種了不出，過幾天再種，再不出，再過幾天再種，我們呌做反復接種。）終歸下出，可見得初生兒對於痘毒並沒有什麼抵抗力，都有被傳染天痘的危險，千萬不可以大意。（丙）關於男女的話；他們的感受性人約差不多，但是女子在月經的時候，在妊娠產褥的時候，感受性比較的來得大。　　二·天痘經過後的免疫　　（用）從種牛痘的善感不善感上去觀察；福依克鐵氏Voigt有了一起有名的實騐，對於漢堡天痘流行的時候，傳染天痘而不死的人們，隔了五年以來，給他們種痘，已經有一部的人，發生善感。過了十年十一年以後給他們種痘，他們的善感成績，和不曾生過天痘的人們一樣。就這潘實騐，就是吿訴我們：發過天痘的人過了五年以後，免疫力已經减少，若是過了十年十一年以後，他們的免疫力差不多已經消失了，對於天痘毒侵襲的危險，已經無力避免了，換一句說，已經有傳染的可能了，有做痘子鬼的資格了。　　（乙）從再傳染天痘上去觀察；日本明治四十年至四十一年的年裹年外，天痘流行，發生天痘的人，共計一千四百七十九名，調查這班人們的從前經過，有十二名是從前已經出過天痘的，其中一名是隔十年以上，十五年以內。其中六名是隔三十年以上，四十年以內。其中二名是隔四十年以上，五十年以內。其中二名是隔五十年以上，六十年以內。其中一名是隔六十年以上。就這箇事實，是吿訴我們：害過天花的人隔了十年以後，是靠不住的。現在我們中國人，還把「經過了天痘以後，終其身對於天痘，不會再被傳染」的一句話，頑固地相信着，不肯種牛痘，這是狠危險的錯誤觀念，要弄出生命關係來的呀！　　三，種牛痘後的免疫　　（甲）種牛痘（以下簡稱種痘，就是種牛痘。）免疫發生的日子；根據薩科Sacco和費他Vetter等等許多學者的實騐，初次種痘的人，大的經過七天以後，就有點免疫力，經過十天以後，免疫力十分完成了。但是第二次種痘的人，只隔了五天，就有免疫力發生。換一句話：就是從來沒有種過牛痘的人，接種以後的免疫發生，在第七天以後，到了第十天，完成了。從前已經稱過痘的人，再種的時候，免疫的發生，比較的快速兩天。後來更有幾個實騐，大的總是初種痘的人在第七天以內，還不見得免疫發生，第二次種痘的人，在第五天以內，還不見得免疫發生。　　（乙）種牛痘和同時發生天痘的關係；漢那氏Hanna有一番實騐，其結果大樞是這樣的；（一）傅染天花後，在潛伏期之內（普通平均是十二天）給他種牛痘，也能够得到善感的成績，再往後，雖然接種了，總是不感。（乙）感染天痘當日或第二天，給他種牛痘，有一例天痘竟從此不發了。（三）從來不會種過牛痘的人，感染天痘後，第五天以內給他們種痘，他們所發的天痘病候都狠輕，都不厲害。到感染後第九日給他們種痘，所發的天痘病候大都是中等程度，不狠輕，也不狠厲害。感染十日以後，方才給他們種痘，都是軍篤。（四）曾經種過牛痘的入，感染天花，在四十五名中，只有一個人是重篤，但也沒有死，其餘都是輕鬆，或者中等程度病候。而且曾經種過牛痘的人們感傳了天痘後，給他們稱痘，若是得到善感的成續，他們的天痘病候，都是輕的。不惑的人們，才有中等度病候。又這四十五人中，一個人都沒有死亡。照這個實騐看起來；假如有人已經有被天痘傳染的嫌疑，趕快給他種痘，也能够有减輕天痘病候的効能。但是要實行這個緊急措施，最要的條件，是天痙的早期診斷。　　（丙）種牛痘後過了幾日，有防止天痘傳染的能力；根據幾種天痘流行時的觀察，大概若得到善感的成績，最多十三日以後，就可以不受天痘的侵襲。　　把上面甲乙丙三項總諭起來，第丙項的實騐，最是重要，因為種痘的目的，是要抵抗天痘，尤其是天痘流行的時節，更應該注意。依照各項的實騐，可以設：種了牛痘以後假使得到善感，那末大約五天以後，有免疫力發生，過了　三天，方才有完全抵抗流行的天痘的力量。所以常天痘流行的時節，遲了一天種痘，就少了一天保障，多了一天危險！　　（丁）種牛痘得到善感以後，對於天痘的免疫力，有多少年月可以保持的問題；經多方面調查觀察，頗有不同，的略說起來：是種痘以後不到一年的人，也有被天痘傳染的，但是在五年以內，發生天痙的，終覺少數，而且病候也覺得輕鬆。跟着死亡率也狠少。隔開到五年以上，就狠不好，隔開到十年以上，被傳染天疸的人更多了。　　另一方面，從再種痘的時候看起來；第一次種痘以後，隔開了二年至四年的人們，有半數已經得到善感，這就是吿訴我們：免疫力已經减退了，對於痘的抵抗力已經靠不住了。隔開了五年以後，差不多有百分之八十都有善感的程度。所以稱牛痘以後，免疫力的保存，是不狠長久的！　　現在上海是天痘流行了！一般幼少時候出過天痘的人，還不肯種痘，并且幼少時種過生痘的人，也不肯種痘。說：我們出過天花，我們已經種渦牛痘，自以為終其身有了保障，這是極頂危險的錯誤觀念！不單單箇人問題！是極頂的社會衛生的危險分子！快點覺悟起來！自動的要求種痘！并且勸吿人們種痘！循環器的生理衛生（下）  范守淵　　血液循環還有個調動全身血液的總機關，叫做「心臟」。這心臟之對於全身的血液循環，就好比鐵道部公路局之於鐵道公路的關係了。全身的血液循環，都打這一個總機關經過的。這心臟的循環情形，我想太家看過生理書的，都會明白；我們這兒只能說個大概的情形：所有全身的血液，都由心贜的「動脈」出去，在全身周遊了一翻以後，回頭，再由「靜脈」跑到心臟，這在生理上有個名稱，呌「大循環」。有大必有小，的確，大循環之外，還有個名呌「小循環」。小循環的頂簡單的情形是怎麼樣的呢？牠是把心臟山血液向「肺動脈」推送出去，在肺臟各處的毛細血管兜了個闔子，再回頭跑回心贜。這種是「小循環」。　　現在，是要說到這血液循環的循環器的衛生了。　　這循環器的衛生方法，第一，便是要如何的來保護循環工作的主體——血液的建全。要保護血液的健全，最要的，須得永保與血液循環最有關係的全身贜器——如肺，胃腸，腎，肝諸臟器的健全。譬如，衣履應當寬舒適體，束帶不宜過緊，以免妨礙血液的暢流。凡從事運動，尤其是劇烈的遝動，不可過久，以防心力不濟，或血流循環不及周轉、而至卒中昏倒。餘如濫飲强烈的酒，亦甚有害於心臟及血管肌肉的工作機能。老年人的以風，據說：一半的原因，即由於靑年時代一直不停的飲酒所致。長期的飲酒者，他的血管肌肉，會得逐漸變成脂脂，失却伸縮性，彈力性，這是事實。飲酒者易於中風，或者就因為他的血管壁的伸縮性减少了，彈力性消失了之故吧。當然，青年人濫於飲酒，不但於血液循環有害，即於其他的日常工作，讀書思想，亦都有莫大的害處呢。又如烟草，亦能加害於紅血球，會使心贓的機能衰弱。對於這燜酒之有害，一般的靑年，本來不會不曉得的，只不過有一部份曉是曉得，却多沒有毅力去避免，去革除吧了。我很希望有烟酒嗜好的靑年們，要有一個戒酒除烟的決心才是。　　這以上，是對於血液領環的一般的衛生方法。還有幾種足以引起血液循環的病變的防護法子，亦得在此一說；第一，保謹皮膚勿使破傷，因小小的破皮傷，每為造成一種「血中毒」的險症的機會。什麼呌血中毒症？就是全身血液被侵入了微生物「細菌」，盛行增殖，血液就中了微生物的毒，這病症是疾病當中一種相當危險的病症，弄得不好，可以送命。皮　破傷的傷口，亦為細菌侵入的一個門戶，運道不好，亦可由此造成血中毒症的。保護的方法：能保護皮膚，不使牠破傷，即是最好；如遇有皮膚破傷的時候，第一，勿用不潔的東西去動牠，（所謂不潔，在醫學上，是指不曾經過殺菌手續的無毒而言）臨時可用琠酒之類的藥液，塗塔在傷口上，即有殺菌防毒的功效。　　第二，在夏季須預防勿使蚊子可咬，因蚊類中有種科做「瘓蚊」，被其叮咬之後，即能傳染瘧疾症。這瘧症，也是血液領環中的一種最習見的病症。往年夏秋之間，國內鄕村，因病該症而送命死亡的，不知有多少萬數，往往造成空前的大流疫；這亦足證瘧疾一症，並不可以小看牠的。至於積極的免除此症，當然是在於除蚊的衛生工作了。　　此外，還有許許多多的血液循環上的毛病，這裏因限於篇幅，不能一一去細述牠。血液領環的生理衛生，就在這裏吿了個段落。用「斯脫來多滿新」治療結核的檢討（三）  楊士達　　（二）成人非外科性肺結核：從一九四四年十二月應曉氏等用「斯脫來多滿新」治療患肺結核的病人。這些病人皆患活性進行性的肺結核，應曉氏的臨床同道，都認為自然的迅速痊愈是不可能的，方決定用「斯脫來多滿新」來治療。致於能施用一般療法，或萎縮療法（人工氣胸一類的療法）能發生効力的皆不在此例，其外能施外科療法的病例也不包含在內。　　三十二個患肺結核的病人中，未能施行外科手術，患重症的二十一個，中度的九個，輕症的二個。主要的徽候，如寒熱，咳嗽，體重减輕，皆存在於二十七個病人中。經過二至六個　的治潦，每日注射一至三公分後，X綫攝影檢查能證明有效果的，有二十五位，十二位的空胴已結疤，有六位的空胴壁堅厚，所以仍舊在在，其他　位病人未發見有空胴。十三位的痰中的結核菌皆消滅，檢查方法係採取最精密的：由胃內吸取的痰，用培養或接種在天竺鼠，都不能證實結核的存在。十五位的痰檢查，仍可找着結核菌，其他四位的痰，始終未發見結核菌，可是結核症的診斷是準確的。　　在「斯脫來多滿新」的治療期中，雖徽象劇重致失望程度，肺結核的損害，由X錢方面觀察，繼續着進行的是未遭遇到，祗有一個例外，以後談到的再發性結核，結核菌類有抗藥力量。有七個病人未感覺到效力，因為損害的程度過深，空胴壁堅厚，或損害織維乳酪化，這類類病狀，大概任何抗菌治療方法，難以收効，但是這七位病人中，好幾位自覺方面甚有見效，當然是心理上的關係，不是治療的效力。　　「斯脫來多滿新」停止使用後，病症復發約有六例，其中有兩個病人，經重新施用「斯脫來多滿新」治治後，病勢再度見轉仕·有一位的病復發後，雖經二度治療，也不發生效果·其餘三位未經再施行「斯脫來多滿新」治療。一般的看來，治療停止後，仍舊發見：痰帶結核菌，空洞不陷落，身體瘦削，天然抵抗力薄弱等現象的病人，病症最容易復發。　　這類患肺結核的病人中，有五位已死亡，其中兩位至死未停止注射「斯脫來多滿新」，其他三位接受注射，到死亡前幾個月。在「斯脫來多滿新」治療開始之初，這類病人的雙肺都已現着沉重的損害，及高度惡液質的現象。其中兩位得着過幾個星期的暫時性的效果，另外兩位在幾個星期中病勢未加重。其餘一例最感興趣，因為經過六個的治療後，曾發見相當確實的効果，可是四個月後的病復發，並且找着抗「斯脫來多滿新」的結核菌類。在道種狀况之下，第二組的治療雖曾施行，病勢仍舊迅性地進行，大槪病菌方面已得着抗「斯脫來多滿新」力量的緣故。　　關於選擇患肺結核的病人施以一施脫來多滿新」治療的月標，為進行性的病變，非一般療法能治愈的，同時在停止治療後，病人能在幾個月中，受經常的檢查，不論其是否再施行外科手術。　　（三）呼吸氣道的結核性潰爛損害：呼吸氣道的結核性潰爛損害，包括喉頭，下咽腔，氣管及大氣管，曾施用「斯脫來多滿新」治療七例紀銀有二例還沒完全，其餘五例得到迅速的効果，復發還沒有見到。其中四例雖然治療已屆滿一年或一年以上。　（未完）</p>

<p>春秋「無梯樓雜筆」自序  卜少夫　　抗戰勝利歸來，業已一年餘，檢點這八年歲月，慚愧得很，除了喫了幾年平價米，跑了西南幾省外，說不出還有什麼貢獻，或什麼成就。聊以解嘲的，恐怕祗有「參加抗戰」堅守新聞崗位而已。　　一個人最好的一段歲月（卅歲到卅八歲），一個最偉大的時代，就那麼渾渾噩噩地度過，實在是够悲哀的了。　　前幾天，偶爾翻閱從重慶帶回來的舊書箱，發現其中有許多妻為我從各日報期刊上不完全地剪存下來的一部分奮稿，文人積習，敝帝自珍，雖是一時之作，現在已成明日黃花，但就紀念此偉大艱巨之聖戰麟爪和個人過去生沽之　憶而言，我還是有所偏愛的。　　廿六年八月十二日我從東京回上海後（廿七年四月離開上海去香港）直到卅四年九月四日從重慶飛回南京，整整八年零半個月，從外勸到內勤，不是在荒山野樹槍林彈雨的前方，就是在午夜昏燈下褊稿子，在潮濕霉悶的防空洞裏（排字房）看拼版。新聞記者的工作生命是短促的，在中國是一天，在英美僅幾小時，有幾個讀者知道印緬戰塲的消息是怎樣採訪得來的？有幾個讀者知道在大轟炸下重慶的報紙是怎樣編成的？這些工作者是沒沒無聞，而這些工作的生命，可哀的是第二天也就消失了。　　八年零八個月，正如其他同業一樣，工作的紀錄就在那堆破爛的舊報紙上，也許在糊牆，也許在包花生米；而這裏，却還留下這些工作之外的一點雜筆，並且把它印出來，我是在甘於接受自己的諷刺哩！　　至於「無梯樓」的名稱，是有一段來歷的，原來我的重慶居所，是一座依山沿馬路建築的舖面房子，房東為了經齊地位，二樓進出不走舖面，利用後面的山坡上下，所以是樓而無樣。這種建築所表示的意義很多，將啓發我們一連串的聯想罷，不幸也不是不幸，我却做了它的主人，在今日，即在未來我還是對它十分懷戀的，因為我不能忘去那一連串的聯想。　　豬肉的恐慌，大隧道案，黃金舞弊事件，節的用電，公共汽車站排隊，望龍門攬車，凱旋門落成，轟炸，參政會，復興關與中央訓練團，……生活搏鬥，生存搏鬥的種種畫面，在山城度過那些受難日子的人們該在記億中很新鮮罷！上一代罪孽深重，禍延我們，今日由我們咬牙切齒地在償付。我們哩？我們有沒有想到下一代呢？　　我戰僳，好像現在還住在那座無梯的樓上一般，鱗比櫛次擁塞在山坡上的草棚茅屋隨時可起火，封鎖了進出通路，而跳樓是時刻在準備着的哩！灰色的靈魂　小城人物誌之一  叔孫如瑩　　　　在一家不算小的雜貨店裏，有這麼一個寄居着的中年人。他不是店員，但經常在店裏住宿，吃飯；有時還在店裏沽二兩酒喝喝，不用給錢，也不用記賬。店裏的夥計們對他似乎很恭敬，稱他做四太爺；但也有時候跟他開玩笑，拿他打趣，他也不見怪。據說他是店主人的遠房兄弟，祖上遺留下來的一點產業早就變賣花光了，什麼事也沒有做，便這樣寄在堂哥開的店舖裏，混一碗閒飯吃。　　雖然他被稱做四太爺，但是他只是四十歲出頭，鬍鬚也沒有一根，從頭到脚，看不出一點太爺的派頭。他的身材矮小而且瘦弱，常常傴樓着腰低着頭，默默地逛來逛去，看看地，看看牆脚根，看看街上過往行人的脚踝。他的凹陷的眼睛藏在一付闊邊眼銳後面，沒有一點光芒。跟人談話的時候，他的眼光也怕跟對方的眼光接觸，永遠帶着一種畏怯的神情。如果有一個陌生人驟然給他一個意外的瞥視，他便會像老鼠遇見貓一樣的悄然避去，嘴襄還囁嚅着，似乎是在解釋：「我是一個良民，我不會做壞事，我心裏也沒有打算盤。……」這到是眞的，他從來沒有打算盤計算過別人，就迎仇人他也不想報復。當他低着頭縐起眉尋思的時候，那只是為了打算怎樣去弄一包好茶葉泡一壺淸冽的茶喝，要不然就是打算怎樣去借幾個錢買兩槐燒餅來當早點。他很少打算到他該怎樣振作起來去料理料理自己的生活，怎樣去找一個小羞事做做，或是怎樣去做點小生意，賺幾個錢。　　他續過幾年書，也會做過些事情，但是這十多年來一直這樣混着，過着一種安定而毫無生趣的生活，他一生中最光榮的階段使是當他在一個煤礦上做事的時候，捉起這段歷史他便會抖擻起精神，向你侃侃而談。雖然這已經是廿年前的事了，而在他猶如昨天的事一樣新鮮和清晰。他底故事不外是一個礦上的鐵匠怎麼樣懂得造機器，終於被礦主賞識而升成了工程師；或者是礦抗怎麼樣被水淹了，要抽幾個月的水才能開採之類。每次當他的故事講完了之後，便興奮地說：「俱的我就一輩子這樣混下去嗎？不！才不呢！我還是要同到礦上去的！總有一天我要回到礦上去的。」這句話他說過怕不只二十决了，但是他從來不曾有過一次眞回到礦上去的打算。論他的學識和經騐也好，論他的年齡和他的這份癖性也好，到礦上去也是決不會有什麼了不起的。這在他自已原本也明白，但是他終希望他有好運氣，能像那升成工程師的鐵匠一樣的飛黃騰達。他對採礦的知識究竟怎樣，沒有一個人能知道，就運他自己怕也早已糢糊了。他曾說過他會探礦，哪兒有煤他一看就知道。因此就有個年靑的店夥打趣地問他了：　　「四太爺，在你看，本城那裏有煤礦？」　　「這不好說，但是據我看，東　廟身底下有煤，煤質還不算錯呢！」四太爺沉吟了一下，認眞地回答。　　「那麼，四太爺，你老人家來開礦啊！」　　「這，這——」四太爺接不下去了，頓了一下，噎了兩口唾沫，才擠出了這麼一句：「困難多得很，你們那裏懂得！」　　幸虧他沒有結過婚，不然他便更窘困了。一個人對自身還可能不負責任，能怎樣將就，就怎樣將就，但是有了家庭的便不同，他必須挑起一份沉重的担子，不論他挑得起還是挑不起。四太爺對自己是够不負責任的了，當然也沒挑担子的力量與勇氣，於是他便老是一個人過着孤獨的日子。有時也有人問起他怎麼不娶親，他只是苦笑着，搖搖頭不回答。然而他心裏頭究意怎麼想，可沒有人猜着。　　縱然他沒有担子，而且又有一碗飯吃，但是需要錢用的地方總還不少。四太爺弄錢用的法子也是值得一提的。他曾賣掉了所有的產業，但這些賣掉的產業依舊能給他一些津貼。當他缺少錢川的時候，他便去拜訪他那些產業的買主，借幾個錢用，這呌做「打抽豐」；如果他賣去的產業又經過一次轉賣的時候，他也可以向新業主去索一筆款子，這呌做「拿上手」，只要他出一張「原業文的」，以老地主的資格來承認一下新買戶的產權。這些都是這小城裏的老規矩，改革不了的不成文法。　　有一次，四太爺有了一個承繼遺產的機會，他的寡而無子的伯母去世了，論承繼資格他是够的，但是另外還有一個爭繼的人，也想着這份產業，因此爭執便起來了。在入殮的那一天，將是爭繼的最高潮，四太爺事先借了一件蔴布孝袍，準備了束腰的草繩，邀集了願意帮他忙的親族，決心要把遺產爭到手。但是在那緊要關頭，四太爺却跑回他所住的雜貨店裏來了，他脫了孝袍，靜靜的躺了下來。他閉起眼睛，徐徐地呼吸着安靜的空氣。　　「咦！四太爺，你怎麼回來了？」一個夥計驚訝地看着他：「承繼定了嗎？」　　「不，我懶得爭了，沒有意思。」四太爺厭倦地設着。　　「為什麼呢？這不太可惜了？」　　「我頭疼，不知道怎麼頭疼起來，非睡不可。—只好由他去。……」　　就這樣，四太爺抑放棄了他的承繼權，放棄了一筆意外的產業，依舊過着以往一樣的生活，依舊為着一壺好茶，一頓早點而打算盤，依舊悠閒而不做一點事情。……　　他將永遠這樣生活下去，默默地生活下去。他是幸福的，因為他並不不滿足，他安份，他沒有一絲毫過高的理想。但是他只可能是這一代的人，而且這以後怕不可能再讓這樣的人存在了。他是一個善良的，灰色的靈魂，但是對於這個社會却是多餘的。圉人呈馬圖  曹逸如倣唐人本火點  青果　　火點　　遠望過去，在烟氛那邊，在山頭那邊，一朶星似的火點活潑地，嫵媚地，誘惑地在跳着閃着　　邁過不平的道路，荒蕪的原野，猛列的風砂，我跑上去了。　　我跑得那麼急，那麼費力，甚至喘不過氣來。　　然而，路還長，原野還寥閱，風砂還大，火點還在遙遠的地方。　　我再努力我的奔馳。　　畢竟到達了那地方。——可是，火點躱在一間破屋的窗裹，光亮投給我一個黑而瘦長的影子　　於是，我悄悄地倒下了。一層薄薄的希望抹上我閉了的眼皮　　影子　　陡地爆開了一串狗呌。　　我若有醒悟似地推開窗子，讓淸凉的夜風落滿了我的胸脯。　　今晚的月光正好，素練般的明輝潤浸着大地。　　我彷彿看見狗子們蜷伏在陰暗的屋角，探出一雙帶着惺忪的眼睛的頭向着月光有意無意地在在呌着。但一跑到月地上却又吠着自己的黑影。　　「那就毀滅你自己吧！」　　我不曉得長在對誰說話。　　「光亮的地方就不會有影子了」　　而這時，幾張枯黃的落葉脫離了樹枝，　　地那麼可憐地飄　　　　　　去了。春柳　揚州夢之十一  洪爲法　　每到陰曆新年人家門上揭貼新寫的春聯，所謂桃符換舊，此各地皆然，可是關於春聯的寫作，在過去揚州，似乎特別重視。文墨之士，每喜自撰春聯，或切地，或切時，又或發抒襟懷，多有佳作。如某姓家居大樹巷，靠近如來柱。大樹巷是娼家　集之地，如來柱是因道旁有一刻了如來佛像之經幢得名。因而就在門上揭貼了這麼一副春聯：「門鄰大樹，眼底無花；往近如來，胸小有佛」。這是切貼地點的。又如民國初年，政府正提倡陽曆年，而民間却仍然鬧的度着陰暦年，先嚴於度陰曆年時，便也自撰一聯揭於門口，聯為「得過且過似年非年」。後來此聯覓會普遍的被別人家使用着，却多不知作者是誰了。這是切貼時間的。更如吳召封先生，是一位負有盛名的廩生。民國成立以後，曾在過揚州軍政分府徐寶山幕中，也在過江蘇省長公署韓國鈞幕中，與　國六七年時，却變成了江都縣署之助理，大才小川，沒沒無聞，自然牢騷滿腹，在過年時會經寫了一副春聯貼在自己的辦公室門口，聯為「愛莫能助，置之不理」。中嵌助理兩字，並運用成語，極其熨貼，此是牢騷的發洩，也便是發抒襟懷的。　　在過去的揭州，一年一度的總有若千可傳的春聯出現。因此，許多文人雅士每當元旦日，常會邀同三五知交，一而到各家去拜年，一面即鋻賞着各家的春聯。彼此吟誦着，品評着，乃至譁笑舞蹈着，充分表現出頭中的風度，也充分表現出風雅的情懷。不過撰擬好的春聯並非易事，再鄭重其事的自家寫好，或倩方家代為寫好，也不是人人可以做到。在昔老輩多，空閑多，其中擅長寫作的也多，多視寫作春聯為一種賞心樂事，自然好辦。到了時移世變，即不能再有這些人注意此事。於是門第好的人家，多壓根兒不貼春聯。尋當人家，因為携上看聯比較新鮮些，會隨便的寫些幾乎家家可用的聯語，旣無新義可尋，有時轉覺俗亞。祇使得一些測字先生或略解寫字的人們每年添了一筆代寫春聯的收入。　　下面且附帶談及揚地前輩關於春聯的兩段遺聞。某一是筆者的先犬外祖翰林臧宜孫先生，當其與舉人江子雲先生為比鄰時，有一年江家春聯是舉人吉亮工先生寫的。吉善草書，這副春聯寫得允工。先大外祖於元旦往江家舞年時見到了，讚賞不置，即商之江先生，請其在當年除夕更換新聯時，用水將舊聯濕透，好好揚下，給他裝潢起來。不想事隔一年，到了更換新聯，江家已不復記憶，竟任憑家人將舊聯刮去。先大外祖知道以後，為之懊喪萬狀，古先生為此特寫七絕一首以解之：　　「倜儻風流老翰林，　　品題一語重南金；　　江郎洗却宜春帖，　　辜負東方曼倩心。」　　其二是包黎先先生。他是丹徒秀才，博學能文，而行動却甚詭激。民國成立後，他因反對結黨，於其精子上曾特別織上「獨立大自强」五字。所持手杖，並刻上兩句憤世之語：「行路且打狗，臨流又釣魚。」頭上更留白髮和黑髮兩處，各的銀圓大小，自號二毛，他設：「道麼，軍人們就不敢來騷擾了。」他於某年過年時，在門上僅貼紅箋，不書聯語。據說，這是仿明代蘇州人習俗，留待文人雅士代書的。於是吳召封先生便代為寫上「陰曹五殿，陽宅三間」一聯。包見之，即自題一絕於其下：　　「陰曹五殿何經傳，　　陽宅三間亦略差；　　多謝到門揮翰者，　　書齋認作相公家。」　　於第二句下並加註「尙有兩廂」，末題「主人包容戲作」。吳再見，復題一絕答之：　　「陰曹五殿是爾宗，　　轉題佳句是包容。」　　於第二句下也加註「相差不過兩廂」，這都是前輩風流，而春聯在過去為揚人之重視，也於此可見。還鄉詩補（有序）  呂白華　　去秋還鄉，余心如噎；旣作詩紀，連載本刋。六日之息，重作東西南北之人；　時江湖歸思，童夢可尋，及瞻衡宇，榛莽迷路。對豕為掩形穢，塡吾牒齒；怒龍猶振天聲，懼彼山首。蒼茫獨寫，若有未已，爰續成長句二首。　　東關斜上黃坭路，入剡詩仙若可呼！急溜拖煙沉陸久，危岩破霧接天初；報秋自雁隨雙展，閱世紅桑付一鋤；故土荒荒難辨認，再還人已十年餘。　　斷瓦空街異夢游，歸心如噎謂何求！自藏封豕　無齒，誰斫怒龍山出頭；兩袖昔涵滄海氣，一城今變莽榛邱；籠燈夜踏槐花路，行到西溪有獨舟。一寸山河一寸血　191  葉勁風　　W君每發一道命令，必定等候一個相常的時間距離；在等候的當口，我們可以隱約聽得出電話另一頭說活的聲音，大約接受命令的人，每接一道命令，必定複述一次，避免錯誤的意思。三道命令發齊，複述已過，W君才對剛才報吿消息的那位靑年壯士說：　　「這裏，在我們動身之後，再多派幾位同志來佈置，省得臨時張皇失措」！　　這位同志退出後，W君這才對我們幾個人笑了一笑說，「我們也得動身了」！設着又轉身對戴先生和那位馬先生說，「這裏二層樓上有一條暗夾道，同隧道差不多，可以通到隔壁，臨時，如有必要，我們可以從那邊出去」？W君微求着戴先生的同意。　　「很好」！戴先生點點頭，「看看情形再說罷」！態度冷靜之至。　　關于W君所發的三條命令，雖然简短，而且滲和着許多術語，我們幾個人，都聽得很明白，大概是指揮部下，前進突擊的依舊前進；只須略略改變進行路綫；至於本樓的佈置，所謂「福」字，」警」字，「友」字，「冷」字等等，我們雖不明自執行的內容，却知道是一些曾經訓練過，而有計劃的行動方式，大的都是掩護上的佈置。　　「我有一個要求」！鶴見聽了W「動身」的表示之後，突然發表了這個意見；「假如不妨害貴部一切行動的話，我和岳君情願待在五樓，或大廳裏。就是耀小姐和虎城，如願待在這裏，也可由兄弟負責……老兄剛才的各項指令，當然是穩妥的成熟計劃。我却另外有一種想法—我希望能够在這大樓裏，先抵擋他們一陣—萬一能够辦到，豈不是省了好多麻煩和時聞？……等我把那羣東西打發走了，我們仍舊可以趕到突擊的前綫上去」。　　「戴先生的神色，表示贊成；W却瞧着我和耀羣虎成三人。　　「只要隊長允可，我願意待在這裏，虎弟料想也同意—我想着，他們這一羣，是些什麼東西，是不是有那位萍子小姐在內」。這是耀　的意見。　　「我認為這是一個很好的辦法，……不過兄弟很抱歉」！W君這們表示了。　　他為什麼抱歉？這是有點外交色彩的詞令，同時也是一種眞情。因我和鶴見都是他的賓客，他負有保護的責任。但賓客另有主張，並且這主張，雖然含有某穗軟性作用—好像昆虫應用保護色抗敵之類，對于W君的立塲，似乎有點輕微刺戟，然而因其出諸鶴見的血誠，W君方面，並無不可接受的道理；况且實地上，也眞能省去許多意外和麻煩哩。這，足以設明W君可以接受，不過也不能不聲明他的「抱歉」立塲。　　大家話已說明，局勢也很緊急，鶴見領導，我們正要吿退了，誰知就在這個當口，屋子裏的警報電機，忽然聲光并作，嗤嗤的響聲，配和着燈光，一致行動。聲音響着，燈光閃爍着，警報了一陣之後，的莫有一分鐘的時間，那閃電般的燈光，突然撤去，只勝下嗤嗤的聲音，仍舊響個不停。放達與執着  亦狷　　放達與執着似乎是兩種極端相反的個性。　　放達有多種：有莊周的「聽其曳尾於塗中」的對於「自然」的放達；有劉伶的「荷鐘隨後，死便埋我」的對於「死」的放達；有阮藉的「裸眼當爐」的對於「情」的放達……或以出世，或以悲憤，或以赤子之心，方式儘多，而其一致態度，不外超脫世俗觀念之拘束，而自放於「葆光」（莊子的概念）之域。　　執着亦有多種：有嚴貢生伸着兩個指頭而斷氣（儒林外史）的對於「錢」的執着；有尾生期女不至，潮漲淹斃的對於「情」的執着；有黃狐等—以及其餘正氣歌中所列舉的一羣—為正義的執着；有哥白尼等為眞理的執着……。執着的方式與具此個性的數量，則超過放達之流多。他們的一致態度是「至死靡他」，有的甚且死了也不放，所謂「棺材裏伸手」者就是。　　從上面頗有偏頗的舉例中，人們或者以為放達者能高尙其事，能解脫，是難能而可貴的。執着者以執着的對象則可區以等第，上者尊之，下者斥之。似乎是放達近於捐，執着近乎狂。捐者消極，狂者積極，積極之於極的，有的難免發瘋。有的則成為廚川自村所歌頌的「傻子」。　　但是另一方面：莊周阮籍等未始沒有執着‘而且是極固執的執着，是什麼？那就是對於他們各自的出世觀或超俗作盧的執着！　　同樣，執着者却有其別一方面的放達：守財奴對生命是放逐的（自然他不自覺）；「有情人」對生死也放逐的，其態度雖沒像劉伶他們的單純；正義眞理的戰士對生死榮辱是更放達的，雖然他們的個人得失之心本已包括在其所追求的大目際中。　　如果旣不能放，又不能執，那才是　庸碌碌的酒囊飯袋，但世上惟這些患得患失之徒最多！　　我寗願贊許赫來德（巴爾札克：人類的喜劇中人物）那樣一位守財奴，我不肯同情首　兩端的貨色！　　自然，說得持平一點，是做人應該抱孟子說的「有終身之憂而無一朝之患」的光明磊落的「君子」熊度。「終身之憂」是「逆」的行不行問題，也就是執着一倘遠大的口標；「無　朝之患」是不患得患失，也就是對身邊的「雞虫得失」應取放達熊度。自由談我的姓名  氣樓　　把名譽看作第二生命的我，對於我的姓名當然也非常重視。名譽就像是一朶花上的氣息，花之不存，氣息又將安在乎？　　為了要使我的好氣息播送千里，於是不得不將我的花倒處供獻，好讓人家個個印象。可惱的是三代以下愛名的人依舊那麼多，因而姓名之間，不免有了鬥爭。而我往往鬥爭不過別人。　　譬如我向雜誌投稿，寫小說的人總輪不到第一篇。有一决我寫論文，不料那編者却主張從此要將詩歌放在前面了。　　又如我演戲，當我演壓軸戲的時候，他們要以出場先後為序，當我演第一齣而且第一個出塲的時候，他們却「以姓氏筆劃多寡為序」了。　　這最後一個主意，眞不知是那一個惡作劇的傢伙想出來的，從此以後，我就常常遙遠地跟在人家的後面。所以我的姓名雖然，常因我的奮鬥而得以在報紙上不斷出現，（如追悼會的發起人，名畫家的推薦人，以及擁護，反對，贊助等等的通電與宣言的簽名之中）却祗有排字的和校對的先生留意，不容易得到大衆的靑睞。　　祗有一次我得到了排名第一的希望，就是在我結婚的啓事上面。豈知我的太太也是一個好名的人，連在兩個人的排名之中她也不肯讓步。她說「男女旣已平等，怎麼能呌女的一定跟在男的後而？我們也要用姓氏筆劃多寡為序！」她姓李，我姓張！　　看了那結婚啓事，我一想排在第二也好不容易，就此氣也平了許多。關於鄭成功  鳳茜　　據歷史所載，鄭成功得台灣後，用重與，嚴禁貪污，的束士兵，不得滋擾台民，如他的親信，因私食台民米糧而論斬，大將施琅（後投淸而減鄭氏者）因擾民而判死，因之叛變。結果立下台灣法治根基，淸滅鄭氏後，貪污之風又起，政治日趨黑暗，結果成三年一小亂，五年一大亂局面，終為日本所侵佔。梅  歐金　　花與綠葉是生命的象徵，可以引起我們熱烈的情感，可以使我們感受到溫喛和慰藉。梅花能在嚴冬將去，春天來臨之這一時候點綴自然的美景，吐露淸香幽艷的花朶，正好給我們以一種蘇醒的感覺。　　在古代的社會上，尙節操，重隱逸，他們把富貴看作浮雲一樣，榮華如朝露一般，梅花就容易成為騷人墨客所唯一愛護崇拜的偶象。舉陸放翁詩：　　——幽香淡淡影疏疏，雪虐風號只自如；正是花中巢許輩，人間富貴不關渠。　　在這詩中，陸放翁是很明確的表托了他自己個性的志趣。　　猶如提起菊之聯想到陶淵明，如今想起梅花，就同樣使人想到了林和靖。林和靖是北宋時代的人，隱居在杭州西湖的孤山，孑然一身，不娶妻，沒有子女，養着鶴，種了無數梅花，號稱「梅妻鶴子」，似道般淸脫的生活，眞是飄飄欲仙了，今之往孤山探梅去的人，當不止是羨慕並且　往於他的這一種淸福的享受的。　　大概自宋以後，愛梅纔成為風尙，凡見詩詞文章，如有梅字相襯，便覺有淸意。於是，在詩詞文章之中，梅花就變成了天下的尤物。　　曼殊大師嘗因為未婚妻雪梅而有愛梅僻。曾經有一决他特地趕到蘇州鄧尉去探梅，逗留在梅樹業中，不忍據去。巴金筆下的高覺新，也是為了梅表姐而苦愛梅花，嗜之若在，彷彿看到了梅花，就如看到了自己的愛人一樣。以高潔風雅的梅花，竟牽涉到了兒女問的愛情上去，可謂是一段奇緣了。　　梅是我國的國花，拿梅來象徵我國的民族精神，的確具有深長的意義。但從國花這二個字，起引起我聯想到南唐才子潘佑，以「已失了東風一半」的梅花令去諷諫後主，看現在的情况，又怎不令人感慨系之的呢！自動售書機美國有一種自動售書磯，只化二角五分，你可挑選九十六種書籍。他使用方法如下：（一）將紅色球形揑手漸漸扳下，選擇所欲購買之書；（二）將二角五分銀幣一枚投人孔隙；（三）將活桿拉至球形揑手所指標部分；（四）所選定之書即自機側洞口躍出。（審為袖珍本，包括小說，故事，諧著。詩歌等，共九十六種）（本報特的紐約時報攝寄）項城時代的貪與侈  愛菊　　貪侈之風，至項城時代，乃更後來居上，達於極點。袁之練兵小站也，即以賄人榮仲華之門，因榮及慶，至辛丑回鐢以後，袁乃由魯撫而直督，由直督而樞府，終至一手包天，遂移淸社。何莫非財可通天，而慶榮貪　昏憒，任袁玩於股掌之上，乃鑄此六州大禍也。然袁乃梟雄之姿，效操莽之為，頗能網羅人才。各省督撫，半植私黨，並非完全政以賄成，其氣燄之盛，羽黨之多，殆甚於會左李之平大亂者，實秉國鈞之人，尸居餘氣，有以致之。甚矣哉貪之為害大也。殆袁居大位，性尙豪侈，羣小謟之，上下相蒙，無非銀子說話，而交通大參案乃起焉。此案事實，包羅甚廣，軼聞甚多，極有歷史性質，非區區數百字短文所能　。容另作長篇詳述之。其根本原因，實食與修為主動，如今之原子炸彈，一發即無可收拾，梁財神之鼎鼎大名，中外咸知，吾人試一想像，較今之奸商屯積，黃金如虎，有以異乎？無以異乎？「偷竊狂」  夢伯　　偷竊，是不名譽的事。被偷竊，是不快意的事。誰也不高興幹這勾當似的。　　其實，從另一個角度看起「偷竊」和「被偷竊」的事情來，我們應該說，幾乎沒有一個人不是多多少少地一「偷竊」着，或是「被偷竊」着。而你却似乎絕未意識到那就是「倫竊」或「被偷擊」。　　舉例來說：你在深更半夜打麻雀，你可曾知道這會偷去目己應有的安睡嗎？不僅如此，而且你會迎帶偷去隔鄰小少爺或對門少奶奶的淸夢嗎？又如：遲到辦公室五分鐘，要知這也是一種偷竊行爲，其缺憾（時間上的偷竊）何當比物質上的偷竊有多大的差別嗎？　　諸如此類的毛病，微菌一般地久已植根在人類思想和習慣的泥土裏，所以很不容易拔除。「偷看」，「偷聽」，「偷吻」，早已被人們視為平常之至，不算什麼一回事，說是「兒戲」而已，「興趣」而已。他們更進一步，甚且認一切偷來的快樂為人間最大的快樂。而更奇怪的是：連國家用了血，用了汗，用了淚，辛辛苦苦，艱艱難難地掙扎得來的勝利果子，竟也偷偷地放到自己的囊裏，巧立名目，化為私有。於是乎，引為「得意之作」，其實是「偷竊在」。　　西歐文字裏面，有一個字，叫做“Kleptomania”譯出來似亦不妨名之日「偷竊狂，」患這種病症的人，事實上並非窮人，却具有專想倫竊些什麼的不斷的衝動，據說，偷竊就是他們這般怪物的「興趣」所在呢！這眞可說是中外同道，沆　一氣了！說丑  聽松　　同光間名噪一時之趕三，所謂三，即楊也，與趕三時同時者，有羅百歲，藝事不亞於劉，而名雋目過之，嗓之巨又一時無兩，例如狀元譜之項丁，天雷報之張嫗，拾玉鐲之劉媒婆，雙釘計之吳能手，此等戲羅若不到園，叫天楞仙桂鳳，往往輟而弗演，其見重於各名令，有如此者。余最愛其百萬齋中之「一只鞋賣了五兩銀，不走前門走後門」兩句，有時高而渾如汪，有時柔而韵如譚，至今思之，猶如餘音在耳焉。　　至於梆子丑亦有二人，一文一武，超羣絕倫，文為劉七，武為張黑，光緒中葉，團拜戲亦有時兩下鍋，常時之武丑，恒演大賣藝，為張伶取拿手，余莊兒亦有時與配。其次則盜銀壺，盜甲，偷雞，三又口，藝事武工之卓絕，決非王長林所可比擬，今之葉盛章，得其十之一二，亦已脾腉儕　。張棒華則更自鄶以下矣。張隸天成，與響九霄同研最久，劉則隸寳勝和，十三旦倚之如左右手，雖極不重要之鐵弓綠，亦舍劉莫屬，拾玉鐲等種種玩笑戲，更無論矣。劉雖文丑。武工亦佳，小放牛與侯筱山同演，堪稱一絕。十三且曉功最住，此戲往來飛舞，共捷如風，劉與周旋，乃如騐與斬，而兩人之嗓同一高亢淸脆，雖遠云長後一排，亦字字入耳，且做工之細膩，幼童穉女，口吻情態，無不一曲肖，眞神乎技矣，每聽苟馬此片，未嘗不歎此曲只應天上有也。（下）危城記  秦瘦鷗　　女客嚥下了一口飯，不就答復。大孩子向她看了一眼。　　「他今兒整天沒有回來。我想問問祝先

<h3>The National Army Achieves Initiative, The Battle Situation in Jiaodong Will Be Decided Soon, Clearing the Remaining Communist Troops in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Jinan, 6th Dispatch] Fierce battles are raging in Weixian and the outer suburbs of Qingdao on the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway. The Communist forces have been increasing without end. Including more than 20,000 men who landed at various ports in Jiaodong from Dalian at the beginning of the month and moved south, the total has increased to seven divisions, six garrison brigades, and eighteen independent regiments, totaling approximately 170,000 men, among them Gaomi. In the areas of yesterday's mountains, the National Army, facing overwhelming numerical inferiority, inflicted heavy losses on the Communist forces and then voluntarily abandoned them on the morning of the 5th and moved to favorable areas to continue fighting. Outside Weixian, the Kuomintang and Communist forces are still fighting at Changle, Changyi, and Dongwangsong Railway Station in Xiamatun, with no changes in the positions. As for the foreign forces outside Qingdao, after the Communist troops who attacked Jimo were repelled, they attempted to attack again with reinforcements. In the Jiaoxian area, after the Communist troops were repelled, they launched reinforcements again from the north and south on the evening of the 4th, attacking Laopeng, Ducun, and Mazhan, and the fighting was more intense than before.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 6th Dispatch] The National Army, firmly defending Gaomi, resisted the Communist forces, who attacked with several times their strength, fighting a bloody battle for three days and nights. After achieving their expected mission, they have moved to favorable areas and gained the initiative. The battle situation is expected to be decided within a week. A portion of the Communist forces in the Gaomi area fled north towards Jiaoxian on the 5th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 6th Dispatch] The battle situation on the outskirts of Jinan was still very quiet on the 6th. The Communist forces, Divisions Jie 5 and Jie 6, who had infiltrated Jiaoxian, suffered heavy losses after being intercepted by the National Army, and there was only minor contact on the 6th.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] About 22 kilometers north of Lancun on the Jiaoji Railway, in the area of Wudaokou, Lujiaqiu, more than 15,000 men from Lin Biao's forces (with more than ten artillery pieces), transferred from the Northeast, were discovered, showing signs of moving south.</p>

<p>[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 6th Dispatch] The Communist New 10th Division and Zhang Guangzhong's 8-9,000 troops from the Lunan Military Region, who had been harassing the Zaozhuang area, fled to Liangqiu, more than ten miles outside Zaozhuang, on the 6th after being fiercely attacked by the National Army.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 6th Dispatch] More than 50,000 Communist troops gathered on the border of Pingdu and Jiaoxian. On the evening of the 5th, they fiercely attacked the Jiaodong Military Station, Balidian, Huangbuling, and other strongholds on the outskirts of Jiaoxian, engaging in face-to-face combat more than ten times. The fighting was fierce. By dawn on the 6th, they were repelled by our defending troops.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Baoding, 6th Dispatch] The National Army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway launched a full-scale sweeping operation against the main force of the Communist army. Nie Rongzhen has led the Hebei-Central Plains Field Army east to Hejian. Other Communist units fled to the Taihang Mountains. The remaining Communist local troops, militia, etc., are currently being pursued and swept away by strong National Army forces. The military announced on the afternoon of the 6th that at 12:00 PM on the evening of the 4th, more than 3,000 Communist troops took advantage of the National Army's rotation of troops in Mancheng and suddenly entered the county seat, setting fires and destroying buildings in the city. On the morning of the 5th, the National Army arrived and repelled them. In addition, more than 10,000 Communist troops infiltrated Dawangdian, Maliangying, and Dongxiaoli Town, at the junction of Xushui and Mancheng, attempting to attack the National Army's rear supply line. Fierce fighting has already taken place in Wangdian on the 6th. Also, the National Army south of Mancheng launched a fierce encirclement battle against the Communist army near Wucun Town, north of Wanxian, last night. Another unit of the National Army pointed directly at the Taihang Mountains. The Communist troops in the Shijing Village area west of Mancheng are currently resisting stubbornly. In addition, along the Baoshi Railway, the cavalry unit of the National Army, advancing south over Fangshun Bridge, is advancing in a fan shape, pursuing the main force of the Communist army.

<h3>Order in Nong'an Gradually Returns, Communist Troops in the Surrounding Areas Have Been Cleared, Partial Traffic Resumes on Changtao and Jichang Lines</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th Dispatch] According to a telegram from Dehui, General Chen Mingren, Commander of the Fifth Pacification District, arrived in Dehui at noon on the 6th from his forward command post. General Chen led the left-wing corps of his troops and has repeatedly severely damaged the main force of the Communist 3rd, 4th, and 5th Divisions in the past week, pursuing them relentlessly. The largest engagement between his National Army troops and the Communist forces took place in the area between Nong'an, Buhai, Erdaogou, Kezigou, Sitonggou, and Panjialing. The Communist forces suffered more than 2,000 casualties on the spot, and the political commissar of the 11th Regiment of their 4th Division was killed. The remnants fled northwest.

All the larger organization buildings in the city were burned down. The cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, and vehicles of the civilians, as well as the cloth and cotton of the grain stores, were all looted. They also stole more than 20 train cars of stored grain from the railway station. In addition, they instigated the people to rob each other, creating hatred. In Dehui, which was besieged for eight days and nights, 84 civilians died, 217 were injured, and 419 households were affected, with 322 households in urgent need of relief, totaling 1,113 people. 1,114 civilian houses were destroyed, 620 shih of sorghum and 65 shih of soybeans were looted from the suburbs, along with 138 head of livestock and 75 quilts.</p>

<h3>Kailu and Suidong Fall</h3>
<p>The Communist Army Intends to Invade Rehe on a Large Scale</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 6th Dispatch] (1) More than 3,000 Communist troops infiltrated Tougou (80 li north of Chengde) yesterday, but have been repelled. The security of Chengde is not in danger. (2) After Kailu County in northern Rehe was captured by the Communist army, Suidong County also fell on March 2. The Communist army committed extremely cruel killings after entering the city, causing heavy destruction. The defending troops are currently retreating to the southwest of Suidong. It is rumored that the Northeast Communist army intends to invade on a large scale.</p>
<h3>700 Communist Troops Besieging Huixian Captured Alive</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 6th Dispatch] The Communist 17th Division of approximately 3,000 men besieged Huixian on the 3rd. The National Army blocked and suppressed them from various routes, capturing 700 men, including their battalion commander, alive. The Communist offensive was thwarted. They then transferred reinforcements from the rear, and the two sides are still facing each other as of the present.</p>
<h3>Coal Train on the Beining Railway Bombed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Tianjin, 6th Dispatch] A coal train on the Beining Railway derailed between Jinxi River and Chadian at 12:30 AM on the 5th after hitting a mine. One soldier escorting the train had his eyes gouged out and was then murdered by bandits. The two train drivers, the assistant mechanic, and the railway police officer are also missing. All traffic was suspended on the 6th. The destroyed tracks were repaired at 1:30 PM on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Severe Food Shortage in Lushun and Dalian, People Are Fleeing in Droves</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 6th Dispatch] There is a severe food shortage in Lushun and Dalian, and people are fleeing in droves. More and more refugees are coming north. Various organizations and hometown associations in Dalian are doing everything possible to raise funds to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Yijun Strengthens Defenses</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Xi'an, 5th Dispatch] After successively recovering strongholds such as Malan and Shidi Town, the remnants of the Communist army have withdrawn to Qilizhen, southwest of Luochuan, and the north bank of the Jushui River. The County Magistrate of Xuanjun is rushing to handle the aftermath and strengthen the defense of the bunkers.</p>
<h3>Different Factions Among the Northeast Communist Army, Lin Biao Will Be Forced to Step Down, Nie Heting Has Been Assassinated Due to Internal Strife</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th Dispatch] The composition of the Northeast Communist Army is complex, with various factions. Although they are all under the command of Lin Biao, the units of the Jilin-Heilongjiang, Jilin-Liaoning, Rehe-Liaoning, and Liaodong Military Regions each have their own independent history and background, and their compliance with Lin Biao's command is often hesitant. In terms of horizontal relationships, it is even more difficult for the various military regions to have a harmonious connection. Since the Siping Street Campaign last year, every offensive of the Northeast Communist Army has resulted in failure. The reason for this is precisely that. This time, Lin Biao launched 250,000 men to invade Changchun. The strength of the force cannot be said to be weak, but after the troops of the Rehe-Liaoning Field Army reached Wanbaoshan, they still failed to capture Dehui from the front. The Communist troops from various routes were unwilling to attack fortified positions. When the National Army deployed a counterattack, the Communist troops were unwilling to defend their already captured strongholds, watching each other, resulting in them being defeated by the National Army one by one. Currently, there is discrimination among the senior generals of the Communist army, and there are rumors that Lin Biao will be forced to step down.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] Nie Heting, Commander of the Songjiang Military Region of the Northeast Communist Army, has been assassinated by the Communist army. It is believed that Nie Heting was transferred back to Bei'an in January. The Chinese Communist military and political leaders had long been suspicious of Nie's ideology, and after he arrived in Bei'an, they sent someone to assassinate him. Currently, most of the important officials on the Chinese Communist side are panicking. Another report: After Nie's death, the Communist army secretly did not announce it, but instead claimed that Nie had embezzled 700 million yuan and fled.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The Supervisory Yuan has added Commissioner He Hanwen to go to Taiwan to assist Inspector Yang in his work.

<h3>The Third Plenary Session Is About to Open, Each Group Prepares Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang is scheduled to open on the 15th. The venue is located in the National Assembly Hall and is already being arranged. The meeting is scheduled for ten days and is expected to close on the 25th. The Proposals Committee is divided into party affairs, economy, politics, and constitutional affairs groups.

The economy, politics, and constitutional affairs groups are being drafted by Chen Lifu, Luo Jialun, Sun Ke, and Zhang Lisheng, etc. The party affairs and political affairs groups have completed their discussions. The purpose of politics is to clarify official corruption and implement democratic politics. The principle of party affairs is to end political tutelage and allow other parties to openly operate on an equal and legal basis. The economy and constitutional affairs groups are still under discussion.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Receives Reporters in Shanghai, Talking About Ways to Resolve the Current Situation, Reorganizing the Government, First the Central Government, Then the Local Governments</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng stated at a press conference yesterday: There are only two ways to resolve the current situation: one is to seek peace through political means, and the other is to seek peace through military means. Because the Chinese Communist Party resolutely refuses to negotiate peace and puts forward unacceptable conditions, closing the door to peace talks, the government can only seek peace through military means today. The Chinese Communist Party has consistently propagated that the Kuomintang does not want peace, but today, the people can easily see who is the destroyer of peace. War is dangerous and tragic, and it is deeply heartbreaking to talk about! As for when the civil war will end, I am not a military expert and dare not speculate. I remember Zhou Enlai saying: By June of this year, both sides can be evenly matched, and then there can be reasonable peace. Such is the view of the Chinese Communist Party, and the people suffer deeply!</p>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of the government, the government hopes that the two parties can join the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan as soon as possible, but because opinions are not yet consistent, discussions are still ongoing in Shanghai. The government hopes that the reorganization can be completed as soon as possible by March 15, and the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan will be reorganized at the same time. The number of seats occupied by the two parties is generally correct as reported in the newspapers. The procedure for reorganization is first the central government and then the local governments. Because the Youth Party has more members in local governments, it is natural for them to request participation in local governments. As far as the Kuomintang is concerned, it cannot be said that a transitional government has been formed if the opposition parties only participate in the four institutions of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans and do not participate in the National Government and the Executive Yuan, jointly shoulder responsibilities, end political tutelage, and complete party politics.</p>
<h3>Leaving Space for the Democratic League When the Government Is Reorganized</h3>
<p>The government's request for the withdrawal of personnel from the Chinese Communist Party's offices is because it is convenient to obtain transportation by American planes before March 5. As for the points pointed out in the documents of the Garrison Headquarters, they are "local reasons." In the future, the government's attitude towards the Democratic League will be determined entirely by the Democratic League's attitude towards the government, which bears the responsibility of the country. When the government is reorganized, space is left for the Democratic League, welcoming them to participate. This is truly the ultimate in benevolence and righteousness. As for the rumors that there are unfavorable actions against certain pseudo-personnel, I can responsibly answer that they are completely unfounded rumors. Furthermore, because Beiping is close to the front line and Communist troops are emerging in the suburbs, there has been a major search. The situation in Shanghai is different, and this is not necessary.</p>
<p>The economic emergency measures plan has been announced, but it must be implemented effectively. If anything is found to be unworkable in practice, it must be modified. If problems are discovered, they must be corrected immediately. It is hoped that this plan will be supported by the people when it is implemented.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng said: This time in Shanghai, one is to urge the standing committee members of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties to go to Nanjing to discuss the reorganization of the government, and the other is to welcome his family members who are returning from the United States. As for the celebration of his birthday, at a time when the war has not ceased and the people are suffering, I dare not raise a glass. I expect to return to Nanjing within a few days.</p>
<h3>Progress in the Government Reorganization, Personnel and Positions Will Be Decided Soon</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] Hong Lanyou recently told reporters that if the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties can quickly submit their lists of candidates, the reorganization can definitely be completed before the 15th. It is also learned that progress has been made to the issue of the distribution of seats in the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan, and the allocation of ministries. After the members of the Democratic Socialist Party arrive in Shanghai, they will gather to discuss and decide. The Youth Party held a banquet in response to Hong Lanyou's invitation on the evening of the 6th, and some discussions were held. Furthermore, the government and the Youth Party do not seem to deny the Youth Party's decision to participate in the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Education. The Democratic Socialist Party may take charge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. As for the position of President of the Executive Yuan, there is currently no firm decision-making discussion. People from the Democratic Socialist Party said that the Chairman should not concurrently serve as the President of the Executive Yuan for a long time. As for Zhang Junmai's participation in the Executive Yuan, both the government and the Democratic Socialist Party said that the possibility is extremely small, because Zhang himself firmly stated that he would not participate.</p>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Minister Chen Lifu took the 11:00 PM train back to Nanjing yesterday. Before his departure, he told reporters: This time, he came to Shanghai to listen to the opinions of the industrial and commercial circles, focusing on the production aspect. He will have to read and organize it after returning to Nanjing before he can make a statement.</p>
<h3>The Democratic Socialist Party Opens a Meeting of the Central Standing Committee</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The Democratic Socialist Party held a meeting of the Central Standing Committee at the Fanwei yesterday afternoon. The standing committee members who went to Nanjing reported on the negotiation process and exchanged opinions extensively. Because they were waiting for standing committee members Wu Xianzi and Li Daming to come to Shanghai, no specific decisions were made. According to Jiang Yuntian, who told reporters, the government has agreed to a responsible cabinet system and, in principle, does not oppose the point that the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan. Regarding the opening up of local political power, the views of the Democratic Socialist Party are not entirely consistent with those of the Youth Party. What the Democratic Socialist Party focuses on are the constitutional institutions in the local government, such as the institutions that handle elections, etc. The focus of the Democratic Socialist Party's demands is that the number of participants can have an effect and that there can be political achievements after participation. As for the issue of seats in the National Government and the Executive Yuan, the current reports are those proposed by the government in the past, and whether the Democratic Socialist Party agrees depends on the number of participants.</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong Goes to Baoding to Preside Over the Reorganization of the Pacification Headquarters</h3>

<h3>Minister Chen of the Municipal Party Department Discusses Relations Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party at a Welcome Reception</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, this city] After Minister Li-fu Chen of the Central Organization Department arrived in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department held a welcome reception yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. at the Municipal Gymnasium on Avenue Albert. Attending were Mayor Wu, Chairman Fang, Commander Xuan, Director Kai-xian Wu, Director Yu-xiu Gu, all members of the Municipal Party Department, members of various district party departments and directly subordinate district branches, and party member representatives, totaling more than 3,000 people. Minister Chen, accompanied by Chairman Fang and Commander Xuan, arrived at the venue to a standing ovation. Chairman Fang delivered a speech of introduction, followed by a speech by Minister Chen, which roughly stated: "Today, I am very happy to meet with cadres at all levels of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department and some party members. Due to the limited time, I do not have the opportunity to talk to all of you individually. I would like to take this opportunity to present a few points for discussion.</p>
<p>From Accommodation to Purification</p>
<p>Our late Premier led comrades to engage in revolution, overthrow the Manchu Qing dynasty, and establish the Republic of China. He believed that to build the nation, the first step was to achieve unification. If this point were neglected, the nation would be plunged into irretrievable disaster. At that time, there were two forces: the Kuomintang of China and the Communist Party of China. If revolutionary forces were not concentrated, it would be extremely dangerous, and the country would inevitably be fragmented. Therefore, in 1923, a joint declaration was issued with the representative of Lenin, General Joffe, stating that China's revolutionary cause needed unification and that China needed the Three Principles of the People, while communism was not suitable for China's environment. The purpose of this declaration was to bring all forces back into the camp of the National Revolution. As a result, the Kuomintang was reorganized in 1924, and all members of the Communist Party were accommodated into our party. We must note that at that time, members of the Communist Party joined individually, not as a group. In order to unify the country, our party compromised and cooperated with the Communist Party, allowing them to join individually. Unexpectedly, after joining, they violated their promises and specialized in making trouble, hindering the progress of the revolution. Therefore, we could no longer tolerate it and had to allow them to leave, leading to the purge of 1927. The occurrence of this event was not a happy occasion for our party, but a very painful one. From 1927 to 1936, for ten years, there was struggle between the two sides, and both sides sacrificed greatly. Therefore, before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, we negotiated with the Communist Party again to concentrate our strength and unite against foreign aggression. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the central government, based on the conditions we proposed, issued a declaration on September 21, 1937, committing to a joint national crisis, recognizing that the CCP military would obey the command of Chairman Chiang, that the Three Principles of the People would be the central belief for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, abolishing the established Soviet regime, and ceasing uprisings. Although the CCP did not exert its full strength for the country during the War of Resistance, the goal of preventing them from hindering the War of Resistance was achieved. We only needed the CCP not to be used by the Japanese, in order to show that our country was unified and able to unite against foreign aggression. After the end of the War of Resistance, we needed to intensify the work of nation-building and needed unification even more, so that the country, after eight years of life-and-death struggle, could enjoy long-term stability and move onto the path of democracy. We wanted to realize the nationalization of the military and the democratization of politics, and we did not hesitate to adopt various methods, such as political consultation and peace talks. All of this was done with forbearance, hoping to establish a unified country. The country must be unified in order to have a bright future. The reason why we endured what others could not endure and tolerated what others could not tolerate was not for the party, but entirely for the country, so that the work of national construction could be completed. However, more than a year of effort completely failed. Whether it was the ceasefire order, the military reorganization plan, or the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, all were undermined by the CCP. Finally, the CCP brazenly closed the door to peace, and by last month, peace had become hopeless, and we had to enter a new stage, which was to ask them to return to Yan'an. In short, our past accommodation of the Communists, the purge, and the previous peace talks, all sacrifices, all tolerance, were for the country.</p>
<p>Entering a New Stage</p>
<p>However, today, the facts tell us that all of our party's hopes for the CCP have failed. Our party has not failed the CCP, but the CCP has indeed failed our party (applause). Now, we are starting to step into a new stage. This stage is very difficult. Although the CCP members have left on the surface, in Shanghai, only 34 people have left. Do you believe that there are only 34 CCP members in Shanghai? From this, you can see that your future responsibilities are very heavy. On the one hand, you must work hard in your own work, and on the other hand, you must be able to touch the hearts of the Communists and make them consciously awaken, so that they also have the concept of a nation and a state. That is the greatest success of our comrades. But this is not difficult, because the fundamental weakness of the CCP is that it treats people as tools, making ordinary young people not even know what a country is. We know that some young people are dissatisfied with the status quo, but young people will never fail to love their country and their nation. The fundamental flaw of the CCP is that it has no concept of nation or state. When Mao Zedong went to Chongqing the year before last, he came to see me and asked me why I opposed the Communist Party. I told him at the time that the realization of the Three Principles of the People could transform the semi-colonial Republic of China into an independent, free, and democratic nation. If communism succeeds, at most, the semi-colonial Republic of China will be transformed into a colonial Republic of China (applause). You comrades can convey these few words to every young person. After the War of Resistance, the patriotic thinking of young people became even more fervent. As long as we actively approach them and actively persuade them, even those who have been anesthetized by the Communist Party will surely return to the banner of the Three Principles of the People in a very short time. In short, the only prerequisite today is whether our strength is united and whether our organization is truly strict. The President has instructed us that the current era is an era of scientific mass movement. What is science? The Founding Father said, "Science is the study of different categories." The responsibility of each of our comrades is clear, every moment of time is properly allocated, every space is appropriately utilized, and every matter is handled legally, which is in accordance with science. Now is the beginning of a period of struggle. Whether or not we can succeed depends on whether the methods used are scientific methods and whether our actions are detached from the mass base. Sun Tzu's Art of War tells us that winning without fighting is the best strategy. We must intensify our propaganda work to awaken the remaining Communist elements and return them to the camp of the Three Principles of the People. I hope that you comrades will complete our mission with the greatest confidence and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Actively Prepare for Constitutional Rule</p>
<p>The Constitution has already been promulgated on New Year's Day this year, and constitutional rule will begin on December 25th. During this transitional period from political tutelage to constitutional rule, we must reform various methods in detail. The Third Plenary Session will discuss this in the future. In short, our words and actions must be especially careful. Each of our comrades should raise our vigilance, increase the enthusiasm of our work, and study how to improve the technology of our work. We must regard the district branch as a school and as a research institution to correct our shortcomings. We have now moved from the defensive response stage to the progressive striving stage. I hope that you comrades will, based on the glorious history of struggle in the past, adapt to the needs of the times and complete the arduous mission with the greatest determination and effort. After the speech, Chairman Fang encouraged all comrades to abide by Minister Chen's instructions, work diligently, and introduced Commander Xuan to speak. Xuan pointed out that during the period of national construction, it is urgent to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, and what the citizens of Shanghai need most at present is "stability first." He hoped that the party and government would work together to stabilize Greater Shanghai. The meeting adjourned around 12:00 noon.</p>
<h3>Implementing Planned Economy to Save the Current Crisis; Measures for Handling Foreign Deposits Drawn Up</h3>

<h3>Order in Taiwan Returns to Normal; Government Determined to Improve Politics; Chen Yi Sincerely Explains to Taiwanese Compatriots in Broadcast</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 6th] The disturbances in Taiwan, triggered by the crackdown on cigarette smuggling in Taipei, have been handled through the cooperation of the Governor-General's Office and representatives from all sectors, and social order is gradually returning to normal. Regarding the aftermath of punishing the perpetrators and providing compensation, matters are being handled separately. At 11:00 a.m. today, Governor-General Chen Yi met with representatives of the people, including Jiang Weichuan, and conducted further review of future governance. Chen announced on the spot the government's major decision to improve politics. The meeting ended at 12:40 p.m. (see Chen Yi's broadcast speech for details). The representatives present were satisfied and expressed that they would encourage all compatriots in the province to abide by and implement the decision.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taipei, 6th] Governor-General Chen Yi broadcast to compatriots at 8:30 p.m. tonight. The full text is as follows: Taiwanese compatriots, since the "February 28th" incident occurred in Taipei, I have broadcast twice, announcing extremely peaceful solutions. Thanks to the efforts of the authorities and local people in Taipei over the past few days, order has been restored. The various counties and cities that had problems are also improving, and I expect they will return to their original state soon. However, there is still one issue that everyone is concerned about, which is how to improve politics. To improve politics, we must first adjust personnel. I have also considered this point, and I would like to openly and honestly discuss my thoughts with you: First, regarding provincial-level administrative organs, I have considered changing the Governor-General's Office to a Provincial Government and have requested instructions from the central government. Once approved, it can be implemented. During the reorganization, the members of the Provincial Government, the nine department heads, or the heads of various departments, should be appointed as much as possible from local people in the province. It is hoped that the Provincial Assembly and other legitimate organizations that can represent public opinion will recommend suitable local candidates with high character, correct thinking, and outstanding abilities to the central government.</p>
<p>Second, regarding county and city-level administrative organs, I have planned and prepared to hold direct elections to elect county and city mayors starting on July 1st, under the condition that the procedures can be completed. As for the current county and city mayors who have not been democratically elected, I can dismiss those whom the local people believe are incompetent and appoint others based on consultations among the local county and city councils and various legitimate organizations. If you want to participate, you can also be decided by local people through consultation. In short, I hope to represent the majority of public opinion and jointly recommend three candidates, from whom I will appoint one person to serve as county magistrate or mayor and be responsible for preparing for the democratic election of county magistrates and mayors. The current county magistrates and mayors who are deemed competent by the people will continue to perform their duties. As for how to reform various administrations, the provincial government will decide after the reorganization, and the county and city governments will be responsible after the county magistrates and mayors are adjusted.</p>
<p>I have decided to resolve the political problem in this way, but the most important thing at present is to quickly restore order, otherwise the traitors can take the opportunity to make trouble and easily ruin the place. This afternoon, there were still lawless people riding in trucks and snatching weapons from soldiers on the road. The grain problem is also becoming increasingly serious. Now that order has not been established, it is said that the black market price of rice has soared to more than 60 yuan, and the lives of ordinary people have been greatly affected and are extremely painful. I have also heard that students at National Taiwan University have been eating porridge for several days, and I am very concerned. You must know that the current food shortage is entirely caused by the lack of order. To solve the food shortage, we must quickly restore order.</p>
<p>I have heard that some compatriots have moved away because the traitors are spreading rumors to confuse the public. I hope that you will trust the government and not easily believe rumors. The greatest virtue of the Chinese nation is tolerance, not repaying evil with evil. Can we not show the beauty of tolerance towards our own compatriots in this province? This afternoon, I have already spoken to the civil servants and teachers in this city, asking them to show the virtue of tolerance of our Chinese nation, forget this tragic incident, and love and unite with our compatriots in this province.</p>
<p>Compatriots: I have already told you the principles for solving the political problem. As long as the method is decided, it can be implemented. From now on, everyone should quickly calm down, assist the government, restore order, solve the food problem, and prepare for the reorganization of the provincial government and the democratic election of county and city mayors. I mean what I say and take full responsibility for my words. After this painful experience, I hope that the government and the people will jointly strive for a stable, prosperous, pleasant, and peaceful life.</p>

<p>[Another dispatch] Minister Chongxi Bai, Leng Xin, and Fu Zuoyi, etc., had breakfast on the morning of the 5th, especially with naked oats produced in Sui province.

<h3>Jiangdi Levee in Xiaguan Continues to Collapse; Several Docks Are in Danger; Bureau of Public Works Concentrates Efforts on Emergency Repairs</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Jiangdi Levee in Xiaguan continues to collapse, and the trend is expanding, which is of great concern to all parties in Beijing. After the collapse of Pier No. 3, Piers No. 4 and No. 5 are also showing signs of danger. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works is currently suspending all ordinary projects, concentrating all its efforts on conducting on-site surveys of water power, water level, and bank conditions, and immediately carrying out emergency repairs. However, it is estimated that 1 billion yuan will be needed for the project, which the municipal government cannot afford, and it plans to submit a request to the Executive Yuan for allocation. According to Jiangshui ghosts in Xiaguan, the underground of Piers No. 3, 4 are already empty, and they can directly reach the houses along the river. If emergency rescue is not carried out, it is expected that the houses along the river will soon have the danger of collapsing. According to navigation experts, if the authorities do not repair them quickly during the period of low water, the Jiangbian area may become a swamp when the summer water rises sharply. In addition, Pier No. 10 is also in danger and may collapse at any time. Former Mayor Ma Chaojun went to inspect it on the morning of the 6th. Municipal councilor Li Tang and others have submitted a meeting to study the issue of responsibility for the seepage case.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Gold Rush Investigation Report Continued from Yesterday</h3>
<p>Analysis of the Causes of Gold Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>Second, analysis of the reasons for gold price changes: Our government borrowed money from the United States, part of which was used to purchase and transport five million taels of gold. The gold policy began to be implemented with the original intention of tightening currency and stabilizing prices. However, due to improper measures by policy implementers and negligence by those executing the business, corruption arose, and the result of the gold policy was the opposite of what was intended. This is one reason for gold price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Those who hold a large amount of legal tender do not engage in production but aim solely to profit. Shanghai is the financial center of the country, and floating capital from all over the country rushes to gather here. The actions of this so-called floating capital and the manipulation by big players are natural phenomena. Now, with inflation, large amounts of legal tender are concentrated in the hands of a few wealthy individuals, who speculate in gold. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>Since the central government announced subsidy measures, imports have decreased, leading to hoarding of foreign goods and an increase in black market items. Transactions are often conducted in gold because of the desire to hoard foreign goods, which inevitably leads to a scramble for gold. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>Shanghai is full of banks and money houses, none of which engage in productive enterprises but engage in commercial speculation and usury. Purchasing gold is unavoidable. This is the fourth reason.</p>
<p>Shanghai workers' wages are too high. At the end of last year according to the lunar calendar, the bonuses and rewards distributed by various factories exceeded 500 billion. Those who held this large amount of legal tender mostly scrambled to buy gold. During the days leading up to the Lunar New Year, gold shops were crowded with buyers. This is the fifth reason.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, the government decided to issue production loans to factories in Shanghai. A total of 314 factories were approved for loans totaling over 65.5 billion yuan. This huge amount of legal tender suddenly increased in the market was not used for production but was used for speculation, harming the market. This is the sixth reason.</p>
<p>Recently, many military and government institutions have been using emergency payment orders or other excuses and means to withdraw cash in Shanghai, misappropriating public funds to engage in commercial speculation, including buying and selling gold. This is the seventh reason.</p>
<p>Shanghai's banks and money houses frequently violate regulations for collateral loans, using 100 million yuan in gold and US dollars and 20,000 gold bars to manipulate legal tender for speculation, disrupting the market. At the end of the year, various banks and money houses settle accounts and receive substantial income, some of which is also used to purchase gold. This is the eighth reason. After the announcement of restrictions on foreign exchange supply, applicants for foreign exchange often only received approval for half or part of their request, forcing merchants to search the market for gold and US dollars on their own. This is the ninth reason.</p>
<p>The Communist Party spreads rumors and incites people to transport agricultural products such as grain, pigs, and cattle from northern Jiangsu to Shanghai specifically to buy gold. This kind of attempt is even more prevalent in Shanghai, and Shanghai newspapers occasionally publish black market gold prices, fueling the gold rush. This is the tenth reason.</p>
<p>In the days before February 8th, the Central Bank suddenly suspended secret transactions, and from the 9th, it suddenly stopped open allocation, causing prices to gradually increase from the 4th to the 8th, and skyrocketing after the 9th. People generally believed that the Central Bank's gold reserves were depleted, leading to even more frantic buying. Moreover, counterfeit gold bars were discovered in the market at this time, further eroding confidence. This is the eleventh reason. In short, the expansion of legal tender, the wavering of credit, and the instability of the situation all create psychological panic among the people, who are unwilling to hold legal tender. Coupled with the Lunar New Year, the Central Bank suddenly issued large denomination bills of 5,000 and 10,000 yuan, concealing the policy in advance and not informing the people of its issuance policy, thus people rush to abandon legal tender and store it in goods and gold. This is inevitable and is the intrinsic factor in gold price fluctuations. (Continued on page 3)</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Legislative Council to Be Amended Official Councilors Reduced by Two, Chinese Councilors Stipulated at Three Yang Muqi Advocates for Half of Municipal Councilors to Be Chinese</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency Hong Kong 5th dispatch] A Hong Kong government spokesperson announced tonight that, according to a statement made by the British Colonial Secretary in the Lower House, Hong Kong will amend the Municipal Legislative Council. The original nine official councilor seats will be reduced to seven. According to the statement, the British government has accepted the decision made after consultation between Hong Kong Governor Yang Muqi and representatives of various local organizations, that the Hong Kong government should be formed on the basis of the broadest possible representation. It also stated that most councilors will be elected and will gradually assume all the responsibilities currently held by the central government. The scope of the Hong Kong municipality will include Kowloon, but the New Territories outside Kowloon will not be included. As for the amendment of the current Legislative Council organization, more direct representatives will be selected from non-official organizations and increased proportionally. The number of official councilors will be reduced from nine to seven, and of the eight non-official members, three will be Chinese. Two will be directly nominated by the Municipal Council, one each will be designated by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the non-official Justice of the Peace, and the remaining number will still be designated by the Hong Kong Governor. However, no mention has been made of the proposed Municipal Council organization. It is not yet known whether the Chinese, who constitute the majority of Hong Kong's population, will be able to obtain a larger number of representatives. Yang Muqi had proposed that half of the 48 members of the Municipal Council be local Chinese, but this proposal has been attacked as unfair.</p>

China can only enjoy peace after freeing itself from communism. The Chinese Communist Party had previously agreed to some major parts of the constitution, but later refused, which shows that they intend to disrupt and have no intention of coordination. Quintanilla praised Chairman Chiang's personality and leadership skills. He said: "Although I was stationed in China for only two years, I was deeply impressed by the honesty and diligence of the Chinese people, and I will never forget China."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Sending CCP Personnel Back to Yan'an</h3>
<p>The CCP personnel residing in various places in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing flew back to Yan'an today on American aircraft. This must be said to be a major event in domestic politics this year. We, who are full of hope for peace, once rejoiced at the prospect of peace, unity, and democracy. Today, as CCP personnel withdraw to Yan'an, in addition to offering our friendly wishes for a safe journey, we cannot help but sigh at their return!</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is subtle and complex. The more one tries to untangle the tangled threads, the more tangled they become, and the farther away peace becomes. The reason for today's temporary severance of relations is, of course, a matter of different opinions. However, the fact that the Communist Party refused peace talks and, more recently, denied the legal status of the National Government is undoubtedly the reason why the door to peace is completely closed. From our objective point of view, there was hope for success in the matter of peace negotiations. The reason for the breakdown was that the Political Consultative Conference at that time did not effectively resolve the Northeast issue. Although there was a ceasefire resolution on January 10th last year, there was still a dispute over the right to take over the Northeast. The government had the right to take over the Northeast in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Agreement, while the Communist Party, taking advantage of its proximity, preemptively occupied Changchun, Harbin, and the railway lines, which forced the first ceasefire order on January 21st last year to fail. On May 23rd, the National Army recovered Changchun, and the Communist Army inside the pass launched a strategic offensive to coordinate with the Northeast. Then, the Military Mediation Department was busy for a long time, and the military ceasefire negotiations began to make headway. On June 2nd, there was a second ceasefire order. Unexpectedly, the point of contention shifted again to the proportion of the Communist Army inside the pass and the withdrawal of the Communist Army from Rehe, Chahar, and northern Jiangsu. Negotiations after negotiations, procrastination after procrastination, the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou on July 3rd and issued the convocation order for the National Assembly, thinking that the military could come to an end and hoping to resume political negotiations. During this period, thanks to the efforts of American General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, other parties and social figures in the country, on October 16th, Chairman Chiang issued an eight-point statement to resolve the situation, and in November, he issued a third indefinite ceasefire order, hoping to gain the list of representatives from the Communist Party to participate in the National Assembly. As a result, peace talks were shelved again. On November 19th, Zhou Enlai and others withdrew to Yan'an, and the general situation had been determined. When General Marshall and Zhou parted, they suggested that Yan'an consider a comprehensive ceasefire on all lines and reopen negotiations. On December 6th, Zhou replied to Marshall, believing that only by immediately disbanding the National Assembly currently being convened and restoring the military position before the ceasefire order of January 13th could all negotiations be restarted. This statement aimed to disintegrate the National Assembly in spirit, undermine the government's credibility, and destroy the value of the constitution. The problem was obviously becoming more complex.</p>
<p>On January 8th of this year, General Marshall left China and returned to the United States, issuing a statement acknowledging the failure of the ceasefire. At this time, the overall situation had reached an impasse. Most observers believed that there was little hope of reversing it, but the government still tried hard to break the deadlock. On January 15th, the government notified Ambassador Stuart to inform the central government that the government intended to send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an with peace talk conditions. As a result, Yan'an formally announced its rejection on the 17th. On the 20th, the government issued four statements, but the CCP still refused to accept them. As the situation evolved to this point, military conflicts on all lines became more intense, and the US government announced the termination of its relationship with the three-person group. Then, the Military Mediation Department announced its end. This is the factual process of the government's pursuit of peace talks and the Communist Party's rejection of peace talks over the past year or so.</p>
<p>Although the door to peace talks has been closed, CCP personnel still remain in various places in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, seemingly as if the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are both watching the overall situation, and the political relationship between each other is still tenuously connected. Politics is inherently pragmatic. As long as there are subjective and objective efforts, the door to peace does not seem to be impossible to reopen. However, on February 2nd, the CCP suddenly issued a bombastic statement in Yan'an, denying the validity of all treaties for foreign negotiations, loans, leases, and trade and navigation concluded by the National Government after January 10th last year, and emphasized that the CCP neither acknowledges nor assumes any obligations now or in the future. The nature of this statement is absurd. The National Government is a legitimate government and has long been internationally recognized. There is no reason why a domestic opposition party opposes it while it is internationally recognized! The means by which an opposition party seizes power, the rational and democratic means, are electoral competition and struggles over policies and propaganda; the irrational means are violent revolutions. There is no way to shatter the government's legal status in this way. Therefore, this statement by the Communist Party has no repercussions at home or abroad, and only adds to the ridicule of enlightened people. However, the side effect of this statement is to stimulate a legitimate government. In addition, the Communist armies in various places have stepped up their attacks on the National Army, appearing as enemy countries. Therefore, on February 28th, the government took measures to request the withdrawal of CCP personnel. This measure seems to be the government's countermeasure against the Communist Party, and the Communist Party's determination to sever relations with the government was already evident in the statement on the 2nd of the 2nd month. This is the misfortune caused by the Communist Party's policies, and also the misfortune of the Kuomintang and Communist Party's prospects for peace and unity. It is really worrying about the evolution of the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the withdrawal of CCP personnel, people generally believe that this is an inevitable trend, so there is no surprise internationally. As for the withdrawal of CCP personnel in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, in fact, the CCP may not be willing to withdraw all the lurking party members. Not to mention other places, let's take Shanghai as an example: according to the list nominated by the CCP, there are 17 people in the Zhou Mansion at 107 Sinan Road and 17 people in the Xinhua Daily at Zhubaoshan Road. Any discerning person should know that the number of CCP personnel in Shanghai is definitely more than these 34 people. This kind of withdrawal method obviously has two opposite effects: because CCP cadres withdrew in a hurry, only 34 people were withdrawn, while other party members were abandoned. If this is the case, then the CCP's sense of responsibility to its party members seems to be insufficient. It has failed to fulfill its obligation to withdraw and protect its party members. This is one. Or the CCP has a planned reservation of latent party members, and after the severance of relations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, it will still take secret activities and prepare to be hostile to the government in action. If this is the case, then the people's tranquility and the order of society will inevitably be threatened by political secret struggles; water flows downwards, and fire burns upwards. The future situation may be unimaginable. Therefore, it is hoped that the government can investigate and register the CCP party members in Shanghai and other places. Their freedom of thought and belief should be allowed, but their actions should not be allowed to affect peace and order, and their personal safety should be guaranteed. If the government allows it to go unchecked and does not take appropriate measures, then if any turmoil unfortunately occurs, and the people suffer losses, or the CCP party members lose legal protection, the responsibility of the government authorities is difficult to shirk.</p>
<p>In short, today is the time for the country to correct chaos and restore order. Everything must not be chaotic. The permanent peace and unity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is what we fervently hope for. Today, on this day when the Kuomintang and Communist Party's relations have temporarily broken down, we cannot but reiterate our views. On the government's side, we hope that it will continue to do its best to pursue the realization of peace, making every effort for every ray of hope. On the side of all parties and social figures, we hope that they can still seek favorable opportunities, participate in the government as soon as possible, and try to break the deadlock in peace talks and rebuild peace. To the CCP and the CCP personnel who have withdrawn to Yan'an, we hope that they will face up to the reality of politics, not make decisions based on emotions, be frank and open, lay down their weapons, and still make the last and greatest efforts for the future peace prospects. "The past cannot be recovered, but we hope for the present." Although we are very worried about the current situation of the country, we are gazing at the brilliant rosy clouds in the distance. The country's future is gradually moving towards governance, and there is infinite hope. Let us encourage each other!</p>

Since Foreign Minister Bidault has already gone to Moscow, Marshall will discuss matters with Acting Foreign Minister de Hauteclocque. According to the French side, Foreign Minister de Hauteclocque will ask to what extent Marshall's attitude towards a suggestion made by Vernasse in April last year, regarding the signing of a four-power pact to guarantee German disarmament for 25 years after the end of Allied occupation. Does Marshall still wish to proceed with the signing of the agreement? Marshall is scheduled to fly from Paris to Berlin on Friday and to Moscow before the weekend.</p>

Marshall told reporters: "This trip is fast, ahead of schedule. I am sincerely pleased to revisit France and have the opportunity to have contact with French government personnel. Perhaps asked about the Moscow Conference, Secretary Marshall only said that before expressing his opinion, he should quietly observe the development of the situation. After Marshall and his party got off the plane, they drove to the US Embassy to rest. French Prime Minister Ramadier issued a welcoming speech on the day of Secretary Marshall's arrival, saying: "We are greatly honored to have General Marshall as our guest for a few days. General Marshall is one of the greatest creators of our common victory. The French government should do its best to repay him. As far as we French are concerned, General Marshall is not only a representative of an allied country, but also one of the creators of the liberation of France. We should express our gratitude in the most glorious way in the next two days. It is a pity that Secretary Marshall's stay here is too short." French President Auriol is scheduled to meet with Marshall at the Presidential Palace that evening.</p>
<p>[Reuters Paris 6th Dispatch] According to the Chicago Tribune reporter on Secretary Marshall's special plane, at the French President's banquet, Secretary Marshall will discuss with the French government leaders the alliance relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union, and France may suggest, in a skillful way, the establishment of a similar alliance with the United States. Former US Secretary of State Byrnes made such a proposal to the French side last summer, but was rejected by the French side. Now that the diplomatic situation is different from last summer, the French government may be willing to raise this matter.</p>
<p>[Reuters London 5th Dispatch] British Foreign Secretary Bevin and others arrived in Berlin this afternoon and will arrive in Warsaw at noon on Thursday.

<h3>The Foreign Ministers' Conference Faces Difficulties; Doubt Remains Whether a Peace Treaty with Germany Can Be Completed; Secretary Marshall Issues Statement Before Leaving the Country</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 5th] Secretary of State Marshall departed today for Moscow to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Prior to his departure, he publicly expressed doubt as to whether the conference could complete a peace treaty with Germany. Marshall urged people worldwide not to harbor excessive hopes. He hoped a treaty with Austria could be drafted in Moscow, but regarding the larger issue of a German peace treaty, he deemed it "highly doubtful." Therefore, another Foreign Ministers' Conference may be held later this year to attempt to break the deadlock between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the German peace issue. Furthermore, according to Agence France-Presse, Republican foreign policy expert John Foster Dulles accompanied Secretary Marshall to Moscow. He told reporters that millions of people sacrificed themselves during the war, and their ideals continue to exist. We who have survived bear a sacred responsibility to respect their last will and testament and to create peace according to their ideals. We are going to Moscow to strive to achieve this goal, but for success, we still need the moral support of the American people.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] Evening newspapers report that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will insist that the peace conference with Germany be held in London. It is expected that the German peace conference will be convened after the four Foreign Ministers' Conference reaches an agreement on the German peace treaty.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and Poland Establish Loan Agreement; Polish-Czech Treaty to be Signed</h3>
<p>[United Press International, New York, 6th] According to a Moscow broadcast on the evening of the 5th, Polish Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz has signed a loan agreement with the Soviet Union for $28,850,000. The broadcast also stated that the Soviet Union has agreed to extend credit loans to Poland for military supplies and equipment. Other terms of the agreement include a 50% reduction in Polish coal shipments to the Soviet Union, the return of Soviet war booty such as railway tracks and locomotives to Poland, and the return of German merchant ships due to Poland on May 15th. Furthermore, according to news from Warsaw reported in New York newspapers, a mutual assistance treaty between Poland and Czechoslovakia to prevent German aggression will be signed in Warsaw on the eve of the four-power conference in Moscow (the 9th). It is speculated here that the reason for expediting this treaty is to complete the network of treaties among Slavic countries, thereby presenting a solid Slavic front when the four-power conference convenes. Although this treaty is termed a friendship treaty, the dispute between Czechoslovakia and Poland over Teschen, the coal-rich region seized by Poland when Hitler invaded Czech Bohemia, remains unresolved. Therefore, the treaty does not specifically address border issues, and its purpose is clearly limited to German aggression, and is not a formal military mutual assistance pact.</p>
<h3>British Troops to Temporarily Remain in Greece; British Reply Delivered to Washington</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Official sources here announced that the British government has informed the United States that it does not intend to withdraw its troops stationed in Greece in the near future and stated that if the United States is willing to share responsibility for Greece, the United Kingdom is prepared to accept American assistance.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] A State Department spokesman said that the British government's reply to the U.S. State Department's note regarding aid to Greece has been received. The spokesman declined to disclose the contents of the reply, only stating that President Truman will issue a statement on the Greek issue.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 5th] The government's request for immediate military and economic aid to Greece has aroused opposition in Congress today. Congress will demand that President Truman issue a detailed and candid statement regarding the facts behind the Greek issue. Speakers in both the House and Senate criticized the State Department for independently deciding to help Britain handle the thorny Greek problem without fully explaining how this affects America's traditional policy of non-intervention.</p>
<p>After Returning from Visit to Mexico, Truman Delivers Speech Advocating Free International Trade</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Mexico City, 6th] President Truman concluded his visit to Mexico and returned to the United States by plane this morning at 5:30 a.m. Yesterday, the President flew over the Paricutin volcano, which emerged only four years ago and is currently active. In the afternoon, the President visited the Indian pyramids and Toltec temples 40 miles north of here.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Waco, Texas, USA, 6th] President Truman delivered a speech here today at Baylor University after receiving an honorary doctorate, stating that past major lessons have proven that peace, freedom, and world trade are inextricably linked. The United States is determined to achieve international free trade through various means. The United Nations has now resolved political disputes through negotiations, and economic disputes should also be resolved in this way. Our political and economic relations with foreign countries are inseparable. Our country is the giant of the economic world, and regardless of what we think, the future form of economic relations will ultimately follow our lead. Therefore, we can lead countries into economic peace or plunge them into economic war. The American people value freedom more than peace. The American way of life is based on private commerce. Therefore, regarding the control of foreign trade by various governments, if this trend is not changed, the U.S. government will soon use the same methods under this pressure to compete for markets and raw materials, but this is what we want to avoid after the war. I have great hope for the United Nations International Trade Organization plan. The United States should initiate negotiations to reduce tariffs and eliminate restrictions. A conference will be held in Geneva next month to discuss this plan, and I deeply hope that it will not fail. After implementing free trade, imports will inevitably increase, but the United States has no need to worry about this. Know that after the two world wars, isolationism has been declared bankrupt in morality and spirit. Creating peace and freedom is not easy. It depends on mutual understanding, trust, and cooperation between friendly countries in politics and economics to succeed.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates India Issue Heatedly</h3>
<p>Cripps Defends Government</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] The House of Commons began a two-day debate on the Indian issue today. Sir Stafford Cripps, President of the Board of Trade and former member of the Cabinet Mission to India, spoke first on behalf of the government, stating that the British government's decision to withdraw from India before June 1948, allowing Indian leaders to seize this opportunity to abandon prejudices and reach an understanding, has reached its final and critical stage. This decision will affect Britain, India, and the whole world. It is an adventurous move, but the British government believes that this is the only correct path, and in these urgent times, further hesitation is no longer permissible. Cripps said that the first task of the British Cabinet Mission was to show the Indian people Britain's sincerity. The British government believes there are two ways to proceed: one is to strengthen British control over India, increase the number of British troops stationed in India, and wait until there is a complete agreement within India. However, this move would require Britain to remain in India for at least 15 to 20 years, which would inevitably arouse opposition from all sides in India and would be difficult to implement in practice. The other way is to notify India with a certain deadline that Britain will continue to maintain its responsibility for India within the deadline, urging it to reach an agreement. Once the deadline expires, Britain will withdraw, regardless of whether there is an agreement within India. If all factions in India can sincerely cooperate in the Constituent Assembly and the interim government, and formulate a constitution suitable for all ethnic groups and religions based on the principle of respecting mutual rights, then civil war can be avoided and resources can be developed, benefiting India and all other ethnic groups. Sir Annesley Somerville, a Conservative MP, spoke first on behalf of the opposition, criticizing the government for two major mistakes: one was transferring administrative power to representative institutions before obtaining a satisfactory constitutional settlement; the other and greater mistake was setting a deadline for withdrawing all power. This measure will cause Indians to adopt a wait-and-see attitude within the deadline, waiting for the deadline to expire before they can do whatever they want without any restrictions. Anderson then moved that the House of Commons refuse to accept the government's decision to withdraw from India by the deadline. The motion will be voted on tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Section of British Royal Train Derailed in South Africa</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Royal Train in South Africa, 6th] A section of the supply train of the royal train carrying the British King on his tour of South Africa suddenly derailed at 9 o'clock last night. The extent of casualties and losses is unknown.</p>
<h3>U.S. Sends Note to Soviet Union Protesting Soviet Actions in Hungary</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 5th] It is understood that Secretary of State Marshall's last diplomatic act before embarking to Moscow was to send a stern note to the Soviet Union tonight, protesting the alleged Soviet interference in the Hungarian non-Communist government. The State Department has made no statement on this matter so far, but it is understood that the note called the Soviet Union's attention to the fact that the United States considers the current government of the "Smallholder" party in Hungary, produced by "free and unfettered elections," to be a legitimate ruling body. The note is believed to have attacked the Soviet Union's attempts to undermine the "Smallholder" party in favor of the Hungarian Communist Party and firmly stated that the United States considers the Hungarian cabinet to be one of the few Central European governments that truly represents the people.</p>
<p>The State Department's note, like previous notes since March 1, attacked the Soviet Union's refusal to negotiate with the United States and Britain on a "three-way" aid plan for Hungary, which is a deliberate violation of the Yalta Agreement.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has never responded to the previous two efforts to implement the Yalta pledges, but the United States continues to aid the Hungarian government in order to directly establish a sound political foundation. The United States has already established a credit loan relationship with Hungary, with loans totaling $30 million, allowing the Hungarian government to obtain surplus army supplies. At the same time, the U.S. government is also protesting the Soviet Union's removal of Hungarian machinery and the imposition of excessive reparations on the Hungarian people.</p>
<h3>Korean Delegation to China Appeals for Independence and Freedom; Hodge Clarifies U.S. Policy on Korea</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Korean Provisional Government's delegation to China recently appealed for independence, sending memoranda to the United States, China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, stating that Korea has the right to declare independence in the international community and put forward four suggestions: (1) Please allow the Korean people to organize their own provisional government; (2) Immediately withdraw U.S. and Soviet occupation forces; (3) Abolish trusteeship; (4) Form a four-power technical advisory group to promote post-war reconstruction in Korea.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 5th] General Hodge, commander of U.S. forces in southern Korea, is currently in consultation with the State Department and the War Department here on the Korean issue. Today, he declared that he firmly believes that the most democratic country in the East can be created in Korea. The desire for independence is surging in the hearts of the Korean people, and this is part of their lives. So far, the U.S. military has not obtained cooperation from the Soviet Union to complete the unification of Korea, but it is believed that this cooperation is coming soon. If the Soviet Union knows that the U.S. military has the support of the people at home and that the U.S. military is not here to dominate the world, but to pursue a more perfect world, then the Soviet Union should be able to cooperate with the U.S. military.</p>
<p>The Whole Nation is United to Achieve the Goal</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 5th] Korean sources close to Syngman Rhee sent a telegram from Seoul today through the "Korea America News Agency" stating: "Korean political parties are now moving closer to agreement on the independence plan, and the whole country is waiting for news of the formation of a provisional government." The telegram quoted Kim Gu as saying that any Korean will forget his political party for the final struggle for the liberation of the Korean nation. Kim Gu also said that the unanimous public opinion is "Whether we belong to the right wing or the left wing, whether we are communists or nationalists, all people are willing to sacrifice everything as long as we can achieve unification and independence."</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative Attacks U.S. Control of Atomic Energy Plan Again; Reiterates Old Views and Insists on Concluding a Convention</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 5th] Soviet representative Gromyko, who strongly opposes international operation or possession of atomic energy facilities in various regions, launched a new offensive against the U.S. plan to control atomic energy in the Security Council today, stating for the first time that the Soviet Union is worried that the U.S. plan is an attempt to interfere in the Soviet Union's internal affairs. Gromyko bluntly criticized the proposal to grant unlimited power to the international control agency to interfere in the economic aspects of various countries' internal affairs that are not related to atomic energy facilities. Gromyko opposed for the first time the U.S. proposal for the international development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, the proposal for atomic power plants. Gromyko also said, "The Baruch plan completely disregards the interests of other countries and attempts to subordinate the interests of various countries to the interests of the United States alone." The Soviet representative reiterated that the Soviet Union strongly supports the necessity of strict international control of atomic energy, as Stalin clearly stated in his response to United Press President Baillie in October last year. Gromyko today reiterated the old tune from February, insisting that the first step in the actual control of atomic energy is to conclude an agreement "prohibiting the use, manufacture, and storage of atomic weapons," and then discuss control matters. Gromyko also said that this is only one of the basic conflicts in the Soviet Union's control plan. At this point, Gromyko attacked the U.S. control and investigation plan and its plan for the international atomic energy development organization to universally investigate the application of atomic energy in English. Finally, Gromyko said that the U.S. plan can only be regarded as an attempt by the United States to monopolize atomic energy.</p>
<h3>Einstein Regrets Inventing the Atomic Bomb</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, New York, 6th] The great scientist Professor Einstein recently published an article in the current issue of "Newsweek," discussing the atomic bomb. He said: The secret of the atomic bomb has now become the Americans' "Maginot Line." This line gives us imaginary security, but its danger is actually great. The only way to prevent the atomic bomb in the world is to inform the public of the terror if the atomic bomb is used again and to warn each other. If I had known earlier that the Germans could not invent the atomic bomb, I would not have contributed to the atomic bomb.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Detains American Merchant Ship; U.S. Protests to Netherlands</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 5th] The State Department today lodged a protest with the Dutch government against the export restrictions of the Dutch East Indies, which resulted in the detention of the American merchant ship "Pelham." The ship was carrying a batch of goods such as rubber from the territory of the East Indies Republican Government in Java and was detained by the Dutch Navy. The United States protested that the export regulations not only restricted Dutch East Indies trade but also deprived the world of essential supplies, especially food. The U.S. government reserves all rights for losses suffered by the "Pelham" or its crew.</p>
<p>Dutch Reply</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 6th] After the United States protested to the Dutch government for the detention of the ship "Pelham," the Dutch Customs Office issued a statement stating that the detention of the ship was in accordance with recently promulgated regulations, the purpose of which is to protect the interests of foreigners purchasing goods from the East Indies, especially Americans.</p>
<h3>Admiral Halsey Retires Due to Old Age</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 6th] Admiral Halsey, 64, who led the aircraft carrier fleet to inflict a huge blow on the Japanese in the past, has retired due to poor health.</p>
<h3>Reading the Newspaper from Now On Will Be More Flavorful; Advertisements Can Emit Meat Fragrance; American Professor Designs Scented Advertisements</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 5th] Professor Bien, professor of pharmacology at the University of Oklahoma, recently promoted that future newspaper advertisements can emit scents. Mr. Bien is currently working on an unprecedented commercial advertisement for a restaurant, so that the meat in the advertisement picture can emit a fragrance like real meat. This is a university professor who enjoys the reputation of "scent expert." Scented advertisements will be a new type of advertisement after full-color advertisements. Mr. Bien's new attempt is reminiscent of a recent announcement of a new invention in photography that can produce three-dimensional images on paper, as if the things photographed were concrete. This discovery can further accelerate the production of scented advertisements, and one day, hungry newspaper readers will face delicious food in color, scent, and taste that is like the real thing in advertisement pictures.</p>
<p>France Reaffirms Policy on Vietnam; Striving to Restore Order and Prevent Disturbing Attempts; General Observation Suggests Signs of Reconciliation</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] The cabinet met this afternoon, presided over by President Auriol, and listened to a detailed report from Colonial Minister Moutet, and then decided on its policy on Vietnam. A communique was issued afterward stating: "The government hereby reiterates that it will strive to restore order and security in Vietnam, suppress any attempt to disturb, and prevent violations of the rights of ethnic minorities. The government has made promises to Vietnam that it will grant the people of Vietnam the legal status of a free associated state in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the French Union. The government will abide by its promises in the future."</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] The French cabinet decided today to award the military medal to Vice Admiral Thierry d'Argenlieu. It is expected that he will go to Vietnam with the new High Commissioner Bollaert to handle the handover. Bollaert, who is currently a member of the French National Assembly, must return to the country after six months because he is unwilling to resign from his position as a member of parliament.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Paris, 6th] The future direction of France's handling of the Viet Minh incident has aroused speculation. The following developments are noteworthy: (1) According to government sources, d'Argenlieu's dismissal was because his policy lacked flexibility and was insufficient to restore political stability in Vietnam. (2) The communique mentioned for the first time that the rebellious actions have spread to western Vietnam. (3) The military and peace conditions proposed by the Viet Minh, namely the replacement of the D'Argenlieu team and the recall of Leclerc, have been fulfilled by the French. Although Bollaert has not been ordered to negotiate with the Viet Minh and is unwilling to consider the peace conditions proposed by the Viet Minh, observers believe that this is possible.</p>
<h3>Krug Advocates Statehood for Hawaii</h3>
<p>Pacific Islands Should Be Under Civilian Administration</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 5th] Interior Secretary Krug, who returned from inspecting various Pacific islands, gave a speech advocating rapid statehood for Hawaii and that the other U.S. islands in the Pacific should be managed by civilian agencies. It is said that MacArthur believes that Hawaiian statehood will help Japan become a screen against "a form of rule that we do not welcome" in the future (referring to communism). MacArthur's past achievements and his current administration in Japan and the Ryukyu Islands have deeply impressed me.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 5th] Krug is scheduled to attend the House Public Lands Committee on the 7th to urge the committee to grant Hawaii statehood.</p>
<h3>Standardization of Military Equipment; British and French Negotiations in London; Belgian Minister of Defense Invited to Visit Britain</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 5th] Pravda's correspondent in Paris telegraphed that General Tassigny, Inspector General of the French Army, is currently holding negotiations with British authorities to discuss the issue of standardizing military equipment between the two countries. The British Foreign Office recently denied that Nitetesi and other French generals went to the UK to negotiate the standardization of military equipment. In fact, the Foreign Office denied it to avoid over-exaggerating the bilateral negotiations. In addition, France and the Netherlands will also conclude a military equipment standardization agreement in the near future.</p>
<p>[Reuters, London, 5th] Belgian Defense Minister Colonel Terfve, at the invitation of the British Military Committee, is expected to arrive in London today. He will meet with British Defense Minister Alexander, Army General Montgomery, Air Minister Noel-Baker, and Imperial Chief of Staff Montgomery. Sources from the Belgian government revealed that Terfve's trip to London is related to the Anglo-Belgian arms standardization agreement, but this statement has not been officially confirmed here.</p>
<h3>Spanish Government Denies Rumors that Franco Was Assassinated</h3>
<p>[Our Report] London Radio on the 6th: The Spanish government has issued a statement formally denying rumors that Franco was assassinated.</p>
<h3>U.S. Expresses Approval of Anglo-French Alliance</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 5th] A State Department spokesman said today that the U.S. government is most concerned with disarming Germany so that it will never again threaten peace. The Anglo-French treaty seems to be in line with this principle, so the U.S. government expresses its deep approval. The Anglo-French treaty does not harm the support of both Britain and France for the Four Powers' Control of Germany Convention, which makes the United States feel particularly satisfied. The U.S. government welcomes Britain and France promoting mutual relations within the United Nations system.</p>
<h3>MacArthur Runs into Obstacles; U.S. Army Secretary Overturns Approved Decision</h3>
<p>[Our Report] San Francisco Radio on the 6th: An unprecedented event occurred in the history of the occupation of Japan today. The World Federation of Trade Unions had requested MacArthur to allow it to send a delegation to Japan and Korea, which MacArthur decided to reject, but this decision has now been overturned by Army Secretary Patterson. The U.S. Army has approved the union to send a delegation to Japan and Korea, but will not be responsible for all expenses of the delegation. The World Federation of Trade Unions is a joint organization of workers' organizations from the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France after the war. This is the first time that the U.S. Army Department has disagreed with MacArthur's decision.</p>
<h3>Bulganin Concurrently Serves as Deputy Prime Minister</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 5th] Radio stations here broadcast that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has appointed the new Minister of Defense General Bulganin to concurrently serve as Deputy Prime Minister and appointed Army Chief of Staff Marshal Vasilevsky as Deputy Minister of Defense.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Gold Rush Investigation Report - Continued from Page 2</h3>
<p>Analysis of Responsibility for Gold Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>Third, Analysis of Responsibility for Gold Price Fluctuations (B): The executor of the gold policy and its operations was Song Ziwen. The four people were Bei Zuyi, Lin Fengbao, and Yang Anren. Song and Bei were responsible for policy decisions, while Lin and Yang were responsible for the implementation of operations. As for the truth about the use and sale of gold, prior to January of this year, the Ministry of Finance, the competent authority of the Central Bank, did not receive any reports. Only Bei and others reported to Song in English in detail every day. The purpose of the gold policy was to tighten the currency, absorb legal tender, and at the same time, legal tender was the legal currency, while gold was a commodity, not a currency. Now, gold has become the object of transaction and profit, and has become the actual currency. Gold has long lost its focus as the gold policy. In the past, legal tender was exchanged for gold, but now legal tender is exchanged for gold. The less gold, the more legal tender. The government can no longer control a large amount of legal tender with a small amount of gold, and legal tender is even rampant, with no hope of recovery. Song Ziwen did not plan ahead and stopped the gold policy, causing gold to break away from monetary relations and return to its original status as a commodity. This led to today's economic crisis, allowing speculators to profit while the country and the people suffered. This is one of the responsibilities that Song Ziwen should bear for gold price fluctuations.</p>
<p>The responsibility for the implementation of the gold policy is so significant, and the executor is the President of the Central Bank, Bei Zuyi. How carefully should the president review and plan in detail? However, upon examining its content, there are many loopholes and corrupt practices. The methods of openly distributing and secretly selling gold are not clearly stipulated. The institutions responsible for distribution were arbitrarily designated by Bei, Lin, and Yang as five gold shops and silver shops, based solely on personal relationships, without any standards. Furthermore, the decision on the implementation of operations largely fell on the shoulders of Deputy Director Yang Anren alone. This constitutes extreme negligence in policy implementation. This is the second responsibility that Bei Zuyi should bear for gold price fluctuations.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Central Bank's implementation of the gold policy was to withdraw legal tender and stabilize prices. Therefore, suppressing gold prices should have been the sole mission. However, the actual situation of the Central Bank's implementation not only forgot its goal, but also intentionally followed the black market and even had the suspicion of catching up and leading the black market. As a result, it was exhausted and exhausted, causing gold to usurp the role of the master, becoming the controller of legal tender and price control. This is the third responsibility that Bei Zuyi should bear for gold price fluctuations.</p>
<p>The gold rush has repeatedly demonstrated that its dangers have long been lurking. When the Central Bank decided to openly buy and sell in Shanghai, it should have taken into account the market situation and distributed gold equally across the country, so as not to make the price high in this place and low in that place, gradually opening up the speculative market. Now, gold distribution has made all illegal speculation legalized due to the legalization of gold speculation. Therefore, collusion between business operators and merchants for profit is easy to form under extremely convenient terms. This is the fourth responsibility that Bei Zuyi should bear for gold price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Before February 8th, the Central Bank suspended secret sales for several days, while the market simultaneously discovered Chongqing factory gold bars, leading to a surge in prices. This was because people thought that the Central Bank's gold reserves were exhausted, and they scrambled to buy gold. On the 8th, only one day of distribution was carried out, and on the 10th, the suspension of distribution was suddenly announced. The event happened suddenly, causing the gold price to change several times in one day, even exceeding nine levels. The sudden suspension around the 8th actually stimulated speculators. The facts are clear. This is the fifth responsibility that Bei Zuyi should bear for gold price fluctuations.</p>
<p>The Central Bank had no fixed methods or clear regulations for implementing this business procedure. Everything was freely decided by Bei, Lin, and Yang. The previous application procedures had long been abolished, and open distribution and secret sales were entirely handled by the five gold shops and silver shops designated by the three. There were no contracts or evidence. Everything was decided by the five shops talking on the phone. The gold policy was so important, and the opportunity for gold speculation was so widespread. Yet, it was carried out hastily and carelessly, without any regard. This is the sixth responsibility that Bei, Lin, and Yang should bear for gold price fluctuations.</p>
<p>The selection of the five gold shops and silver shops was entirely based on their relationship with Bei and the other two, without any standards. The capital of the five shops was not the most substantial among their peers. Why was Tong Fengyu alone favored and given such important responsibility? Zhan Liansheng, a shareholder of Tong Fengyu, only held one-fifteenth of the shares of the shop. However, the Central Bank relied heavily on Zhan Liansheng alone. Tong Fengyu was introduced by Zhan, and all the Central Bank's entrusted distribution, melting, and distribution were concentrated in Tong Fengyu. The five shops all went through Zhan for receiving gold and paying, and his signature and seal were required. He was responsible for the overall sales. Therefore, Tong Fengyu also received the most distribution. Although there were five shops in name, only Tong Fengyu actually had the power of control, and only Zhan Liansheng alone. After the Central Bank distributed the gold, it did not ask how it was distributed or what the selling price was. With such a situation of manipulation and control, one does not need to be intelligent to know. This is the seventh responsibility that Bei, Lin, and Yang should bear.</p>
<p>From January 4th to the suspension of sales on February 15th, the Central Bank entrusted the five shops to distribute 79,440 gold bars. Tong Fengyu accounted for the most, exceeding half of the total. Tong Fengyu suddenly purchased a large number of gold bars within half an hour before the government announced the suspension of distribution. The market price soared even higher, indicating that they had prior knowledge and engaged in manipulation. There is an inevitable suspicion of a special tacit understanding between the business executors and Tong Fengyu. This is the eighth responsibility that Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren should bear for the gold rush fluctuations.</p>
<p>Yang Anren was the most involved in deciding the distribution quantity and price by talking to the five shops on the phone. Sometimes, the decision was made only with Tong Fengyu. Furthermore, the market price of the silver shops was determined by the market price of the gold shops, and the market price of the gold shops was determined by the conversation between Zhan Liansheng and Yang Anren. This is the ninth responsibility that Yang Anren should bear for gold price fluctuations.</p>
<p>The number of gold bars distributed by the Central Bank from January 4th to February 15th, as listed by the Central Bank, differed daily from the number of bars distributed as listed by the five shops. The totals also differed. Yang Anren was in charge of managing gold and recording trading prices. This is the tenth responsibility that Yang Anren should bear for gold price fluctuations.</p>
<p>Among the customer accounts of the five shops, there were multiple accounts belonging to Central Bank employees. For example, Wang Songtao, who managed the gold vault accounts and knew the secret of the gold reserves, also had accounts for purchasing gold bars. This is the eleventh responsibility that Yang Anren and Wang Songtao should bear for gold price fluctuations.</p>
<p>The above are the details that the committee members have learned during this investigation into the gold rush case. In addition to separately requesting impeachment for the illegal and derelict parts of the relevant personnel, this report is submitted respectfully for review. (End of full text)</p>
<p>US Treasury Secretary's Remarks Emphasize the Importance of Economic Stability</p>
<p>[Washington, March 5th, US News Agency] US Treasury Secretary Snyder held a press conference today to discuss the world economic situation. A reporter asked whether the economic difficulties of China, Britain, and France would affect the United States. He said that if the work of stabilizing the world economic situation truly failed, and if the economies of various countries failed to restore a sound foundation, then the economic difficulties of various countries would inevitably affect the United States. A reporter asked whether the United States had decided to provide financial aid to Greece. The Secretary refused to comment, stating that Secretary of State Marshall's statement had thoroughly clarified the US position.</p>

<h3>The Second Session of the City Council Resumes Today - Two Urgent Proposals - Request the Central Government to Unfreeze the Cost of Living Index - Propose that Japanese War Reparation Generators be Allocated to the City - Discussion of the Municipal Construction Donation Issue in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Council held its second session at the beginning of January this year and discussed many municipal facility projects. However, the first draft of the municipal government's budget for the 36th year of the Republic of China was very important and the issue was complex. For the sake of prudent review, the meeting was specially extended to February. During the extension period, the various committees went to the various bureaus and departments of the municipal government for inspection, and the Budget Committee conducted preliminary reviews several times. Now that the extension period has expired, the Municipal Council has decided to continue its second session today. The session is tentatively scheduled for two days to discuss the municipal budget for this year and other important matters.</p>
<p>The conference will be held on the fourth floor of the council's new address at Tangzhan Road (formerly the Japanese Overseas Residents Association). The ninth meeting, held from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM today, will discuss the unfinished cases from the previous session and three proposals submitted by the speaker, namely: (1) The proposal to submit to the general assembly for a public vote on the Nanjing Municipal Council's temporary general assembly passing a declaration on the current situation, suggesting that the councils of various provinces and cities each appoint representatives to hold a temporary joint meeting. (2) The proposal to submit to the general assembly for a public vote on the request of Sun Xiangzhong, chairman of the Shanghai Private Schools Relief Association, to include the compensation for the losses of private schools in the first batch of materials for Japanese reparations, which will soon be shipped to China, as a priority for compensation. (3) The proposal suggested by the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Movement Committee to convert the former Japanese shrine at 101 Jiangwan Road into a martyrs' shrine to comfort the loyal and righteous. This afternoon, the issue of collecting municipal construction donations will be discussed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the council believes that the session is very short this time, and the main topic is to discuss the municipal budget. Therefore, except for urgent matters that need to be resolved, it will not accept proposals from councilors for the time being. It is reported that the council has received important proposals, and two proposals have been approved by the speaker and submitted to the general assembly for discussion: (1) A proposal by Shui Xiangyun and others to request the central government to unfreeze the cost of living index from April 1st to avoid affecting the lives of workers. (2) A proposal by Xi Wangshu and others: the city's electricity is short by 60,000 kilowatts per month, which greatly hinders production. Therefore, it is proposed that the central government allocate the two generators from Japan's reparations to China to Shanghai for application, and it is also suggested to form a joint electric company to manage these two generators. The city's power company has ordered such a large number of generators from the United States. It will take four or five years to ship them to Shanghai for assembly and power generation, while it will only take more than a year to transport and install them from Japan.</p>
<h3>Some People Suggest Banning Large Bathhouse Pools - The Health and Land Administration Committees Pass Many Resolutions</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] The Council's Health Committee met the night before last and discussed many proposals. Regarding the case of clearing accumulated coffins, it was resolved that the coffin owners should quickly transport the coffins back to their hometowns for burial. If they wish to bury them in the city, they can find their own land. At the same time, the government will find ways to expand the public cemetery. Some of the unclaimed accumulated coffins will be gradually cremated. Furthermore, a citizen suggested that co-bathing in large bathhouse pools is unsanitary and requested that it be banned and converted into shower rooms. It was resolved that a decision will be made after the Health Bureau studies it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council's Land Administration Committee held its eighth meeting yesterday and discussed several proposals, including: (1) Representatives of all residents of Jiashen Village, Longhua, Wang Longji and others, submitted a petition stating that the municipal government was ordered to forcibly relocate the houses in the village. They pleaded that the relocation be waived and that the municipal government be requested to clear the land requisition procedures as soon as possible. It was resolved to send a letter to the municipal government to forward the request to maintain the status quo before the land requisitioned for the Longhua Airport during the enemy puppet period is resolved. (2) For the Shanghai-Jiangsu border demarcation meeting, it was decided to recommend councilors Yang Shukan and Wang Weiqu to attend. (3) Chen Tingrui, on behalf of the tenants of 1-7 Beidang Apartments, etc., received a notice from the enemy and puppet property clearing office of the China Trust Bureau to recover and forcibly relocate them. He requested to uphold justice and grant relief. It was resolved to forward a letter to the clearing office to pay attention to this matter when handling it.</p>

<p>[Report from our newspaper] American transportation experts Dr. Kang Wei, Dr. Haar, and Mr. Nigor were hired by the Municipal Public Works Bureau to come to China to improve the city's transportation. They arrived in Shanghai on the Lynx mail ship on the 5th. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, accompanied by Zhao Zengtao, the director of the Public Works Bureau, they went to the municipal government to meet with Mayor Wu for a preliminary meeting.

<h3>Jin Zongcheng and Others Accused of Concealing Enemy Capital - Half of the Shares of Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving are Japanese Shares</h3>
<p>[Report from our newspaper] Jin Zongcheng, the person in charge of Guangzhong Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Factory Co., Ltd., and Ding Anzhi and Ning Xiaoquan, the supervisors of the company, have recently been sued by shareholders Zhao Moushu, Ji Lin, Zhao Linhua and others to the civil court of the district court for concealing enemy capital, reducing the total amount of shares, fabricating account books, reporting illegal resolutions, and illegally amending the articles of association to elect directors and supervisors. They requested that the court declare the resolutions invalid. The case was heard in the Seventh Civil Court of the district court yesterday. Except for Jin Zongcheng, the other defendants did not appear. As a result, the court ordered the judgment to be announced on the 10th of this month. According to the complaint, "The initial total amount of shares of Guangzhong Factory was 60,000 yuan. Later, due to the establishment of three factories, "Second Guangzhong," "Third Guangzhong," and "Seventh Guangzhong," the total amount of shares was 1.64 million yuan, which were registered separately. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, the board of directors resolved to increase the capital by 360,000 yuan, bringing the total amount of shares to 2 million yuan. In the 29th year, the capital was increased to 2.5 million yuan. After the fall of Shanghai, it was increased to 5 million yuan. It was found that when the capital was increased from 2 million yuan to 2.5 million yuan, Ito and Pen Er each joined with 500,000 yuan of shares, and when the capital was increased from 2.5 million yuan to 5 million yuan, Ito and Yamaguchi each joined with 1.25 million yuan of shares. From this time on, the old shares of Guangzhong and the enemy capital were half each. The former manager Zhang Xuansheng was prosecuted by the High Procuratorate for the crime of traitor and is now on the run. At 3:00 PM on the 20th of last month, Jin Zongcheng, as the chairman, convened a shareholders' meeting and reported that the company's share capital was only 2 million yuan. He did not report on the previous capital increases and the enemy capital part, but said that the shares had now been increased to 20 million yuan and that all the increased shares would be given to the old shareholders. When some shareholders raised questions, Jin had already arranged for many people to openly insult the shareholders and cause trouble, hindering them from speaking. Therefore, the order of the meeting was greatly disrupted, and the meeting ended in a hurry."</p>

<h3>Fox Spirit Haunting?</h3>
<p>Qingxiang Cotton Weaving Factory, located at No. 476 Jianguo East Road, has experienced a series of strange fires in the past three days. It is reported that the losses amount to a huge 150 million yuan, and the police are currently investigating. The factory was established in the 29th year of the Republic of China and has two two-story buildings. It employs 30 to 40 workers, producing "Qianmen Brand" undershirts, cotton knit shirts, and thermal shirts, with thriving business. The factory owner is Li Jiqing from Zhenjiang. At around 6:00 AM on the 4th, the factory's warehouse, specifically the front building on the second floor, suddenly caught fire. Fortunately, the factory had a large workforce, and the fire was quickly extinguished, but the goods burned resulted in losses of 40 to 50 million yuan. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 AM on the 5th, the same warehouse caught fire again, and was extinguished with great effort, preventing a major disaster. However, upon inspection, the losses amounted to another 100 million yuan. At this point, the people in the factory were extremely surprised by the strange fires. The factory owner's wife went to a fortune teller to ask for guidance. The blind fortune teller made grand claims, saying that it was the work of a fox spirit haunting the place. He also said "no more than two, then three," meaning there would be one more fire. The owner's wife then sought ways to resolve the situation, so they invited Taoist priests, made a ruckus all day, and spent over a hundred million yuan, fully expecting to be safe and sound from then on. Who knew that yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, the account books in the factory's accounting office suddenly caught fire again, but were fortunately put out immediately. It can be said to be very strange. The factory fires are bizarre, with losses exceeding 100 million.</p>

<h3>Son Traffics, Father Sells, Poisoning the Nation, Wang Xianzong and Wang Yuwei, Both Convicted and Sent for Trial</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Wang Xianzong and Wang Yuwei, father and son, were accused of being suspected of being traitors and trafficking drugs. The investigation court of the High Court interrogated them yesterday afternoon. Wang Xianzong has twelve buildings on Lujiabang Road in the South City. After the Japanese invaders occupied the area, he planned to preserve his property and lent part of it to Li Jinfa (also known as Li Xiaocun), who held a puppet military position, colluding with the Japanese invaders Kawada and Kishida, and ordering his son Wang Yuwei to receive training at the puppet navy training school. After graduating in January of the 29th year of the Republic of China, he immediately served as a squad leader at the school, staying there to assist in training new recruits, and later served as a regular squad leader on the puppet Haixing warship. At that time, the enemy invaders were plotting to subvert our country. Wang Xianzong and his son Wang Yuwei, under their protection, condoned the trafficking of heroin and opium. The son transported it from Tianjin and Hankou, and the father sold it at home, in order to make huge profits. After being reported by the Central Statistics Bureau, the case was transferred by the Shanghai District Procuratorate to the High Procuratorate for investigation. The High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution based on Article 2, Paragraph 1, Clause 1 and Clause 8 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, and Article 3, Paragraph 1 and 2, first section, of the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Opium Suppression and Drug Prohibition.

After the court hearing, it was announced that the trial would be adjourned to a later date, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Driven by Greed, Murdering the Cook, The Murder Case of the Male Corpse in Pudong Solved, A Deputy Platoon Leader and Two Soldiers Arrested in Shanghai and Suzhou, Confessing that the Platoon Leader Instigated the Crime</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] On the 23rd of last month, a male corpse was found in a small creek near the Li Family Residence in Zhangjialou, Yangjing, Pudong, covered in blood and flesh, a truly tragic sight. Later, the branch bureau reported the information to the General Bureau, and the detective department sent employee Chen Xianrong to investigate. A piece of paper with the address of No. 711 Shantang Street, Suzhou, was found next to the deceased, and the case was finally solved based on this sole clue.</p>
<p>The deceased's name was Guo Ruixue, 41 years old, from Hebei Province. He was the cook for Ning Jiuyu, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the Independent Regiment of the First Pacification District (whose home was at No. 711 Shantang Street, Suzhou). Four days before the murder (i.e., the 19th), he was ordered by the battalion commander's wife to take four gold rings, four cartons of cigarettes, and a Zhengda Pig Bank check from Suzhou, with a face value of 1,065,000 yuan, to Shanghai to be delivered to the battalion commander. Unexpectedly, when the train arrived at the Zhenru Station, soldiers from a certain battalion of the 436th Regiment of the 146th Brigade of the 21st Division stationed there mistook him for a deserter and detained him. Upon inspection, the aforementioned items were found, and they were overcome by greed. At around 9:00 PM on the 21st, they took the deceased to Pudong under the pretext of escorting him to the headquarters. Guo was brutally murdered with a knife in the wilderness near the Li Family Residence in Zhangjialou, and his face was severely disfigured to avoid identification in the future. Finally, the corpse was moved and thrown into the small creek. However, heaven's net is vast, and the corpse floated up on the 23rd. At the same time, the police found a piece of paper next to his body. The same evening, the section chief sent officers Chen Xianrong, Sun Zhenying, Xu Youjin, and Cui Xiaoyun to Suzhou by train to investigate the address, and finally obtained some clues. They also learned that the due date of the check issued by Zhengda Pig Bank was the 27th, so the police officers stayed in Suzhou to wait. At around 1:00 PM that afternoon, Zhang Shangzhen, the deputy platoon leader of the regiment, took the check to Zhengda Pig Bank to request encashment, and he was immediately arrested. After interrogation, he confessed everything, admitting to murdering for money, and also confessed that the instigator was Platoon Leader Shan Shuyun. He also said that there were nine other accomplices, including the soldier Tian Wenbin. After receiving the confession, the police officers telegraphed Shanghai to inform them and escorted Zhang to Shanghai. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Police Bureau immediately dispatched troops to Pudong in conjunction with the Garrison Command to arrest the platoon leader and others. However, they had already fled after hearing the news. Only one of the murderers, Tian Wenbin, was subsequently captured at the Xinruyi bathhouse on Tongbei Road. His confession was the same as Zhang's. All the gold rings had been cashed and distributed by the platoon leader. The case has now been fully investigated and transferred to the Garrison Command for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Section Chief of Gaoqiao Police Bureau Suspected of Corruption, Awaiting Interrogation</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Cao Yanwen, the section chief of the Second Section of the Gaoqiao Police Branch Bureau, was recently reported by Inspector Fang Zuhuan of the Police Bureau, who claimed that Cao had extorted money from Tao Chunsheng and Wang Wensheng and engaged in corrupt activities. After an investigation by the General Bureau, the entire case was transferred to the District Procuratorate for further investigation. According to the investigation report of the Police Bureau, the investigators summoned Tao Chunsheng and Tao Huangshi, who claimed that Cao Yanwen had accused Tao Chunsheng of receiving stolen goods in August of last year, took him to the bureau for detention, and extorted 1.1 million French currency before allowing him to be released on bail. The bribe was allegedly received by a person surnamed Lei in the duty room of the bureau. According to Cao Yanwen, Yang Mingkui, the manager of the Wusong Seaside Hotel, had reported Tao Chunsheng and Wang Wensheng for stealing bathtubs and long stools from his hotel, so he summoned Tao and Wang to the bureau for interrogation. Later, due to insufficient evidence of a crime, he ordered them to be released on bail and denied any detention or extortion. However, he said that there was an employee named Lai Bingyan in the duty room, who might be the person surnamed Lei mentioned by Tao Chunsheng. This person has now left the job, and the prosecutor will pursue and interrogate him.</p>
<h3>Racecourse Bond Case, Defendant Appeals, Case Concluded, Appellee Files a Counterclaim, Requesting Repayment at Three Thousand Times the Original Amount</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] After the Civil Court of the District Court ruled that the racecourse bond case should be repaid at one thousand times the original amount, Fan Keling, the legal representative of the racecourse association, appealed to the High Court, dissatisfied with the verdict. The court opened yesterday. Cai Wenda, the lawyer representing Fan Keling, stated the reasons for the appeal to the court, with four points: (1) The judgment to repay pre-war bonds at one thousand times the original amount will stimulate price increases. (2) The government is currently seeking to contract the currency and suppress prices. If the court rules to increase payments for pre-war debts, it will further promote currency inflation. (3) The racecourse issues bonds to repay debts, not for production, so it is different from deposits, and its business is currently suspended, unable to bear the burden of repayment at one thousand times the original amount. (4) The government has not acknowledged any changes in the pre-war and post-war monetary systems, so it is not convenient to increase payments. The lawyer representing the three appellees, Di Baisi and others, filed a counterclaim in court, stating that the US exchange rate was only 3,000 yuan when the District Court pronounced the verdict, but it is now 12,000 yuan, requesting repayment at three thousand times the original amount. After the debate was concluded, the court will announce the verdict in ten days.</p>
<h3>The Cradle of the New Navy, The Naval Officer School Prepares to Move to Qingdao, Currently Has 186 Students, Graduates in Four Years with the Rank of Ensign</h3>
<p>[Reported by This Newspaper] Currently, there are 186 young people across the country receiving the highest education in the naval field. This institution is the Naval Officer School, located in Gaochangmiao. It is also the cradle of China's only new navy. It is expected that the first batch of new people will be able to formally join the ranks of China's new navy during the summer vacation of the 38th year.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Naval Officer School was established in the summer of last year, and its training methods and all equipment are American-style. However, it has recently been ordered to prepare to move to Qingdao. This matter may be realized during the summer vacation of this year. Therefore, the various measures originally planned by the school have to be put on hold, waiting for the expansion to take place after moving to Qingdao. The United States has assisted in the establishment of seven experimental laboratories and one experimental factory at the Naval Officer School. The equipment has been gradually concentrated in Qingdao. It is expected that the Naval Officer School will be able to carry forward and lay a good foundation for the new navy of Zhu Lai under Sino-US cooperation.</p>
<p>The Naval Officer School is directly under the Naval Headquarters. The level of entry is high school graduation and those with equivalent qualifications are eligible. The age is stipulated to be between 17 and 20 years old. Because the Navy has strict requirements for physical fitness, those suffering from myopia, color blindness, and trachoma are all eliminated. The entire program is divided into four years, which is equivalent to a regular university. After graduation, they will be assigned to various monitoring jobs and classified as ensigns. Currently, in addition to providing food, clothing, and housing, students in school receive a monthly subsidy of 45,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In the past, the majority of students were from Guangdong and Fujian. However, due to the inconvenience of transportation in various provinces last year, it was not easy to send students. Therefore, due to geographical reasons, Zhejiang accounted for the first place, followed by Hunan and Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Recently, the authorities have also planned to establish a naval officer accelerated training class, which will accommodate naval soldiers and outstanding members of the Youth Army who have been sent to the UK and the US for internships during the War of Resistance, as well as students who graduated from naval schools before the war, re-concentrating their training and completing their entire studies to create a unified basic cadre for the future new navy. However, this matter will also have to wait until the Naval Officer School returns to Qingdao before it can be established.</p>

<p>The Weida Enamel Factory announced at the beginning of the year that it was suspending work due to transferring to others, and has been suspended since. The factory has more than 90 workers. Yesterday, they sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, requesting that the factory resume work, otherwise they would request relief funds.</p>

Yao deliberately falsely claimed on December 4th of last year that he had lost a rickshaw license numbered 9263. After publishing a notice of cancellation in the newspaper, he applied for a replacement from the Municipal Public Works Bureau. In fact, he had sold the original to Lin Ruyou at No. 16 Yongqing Lane, Xikang Road, for a price of 500,000 yuan. On the 27th of last month, Yao again intended to sell the replacement rickshaw license, along with a rickshaw in 80% new condition, to Yin Dengtang from Jiancheng. The price was agreed to be 4.15 million yuan, and Yin paid a deposit of 100,000 yuan. Yin did not go to pay the balance the next day, so Yao sold it again to Chen Agen at No. 81 Yepin Lane, Xikang Road, with the car price increasing to 4.7 million yuan, and received a deposit of 2 million yuan. Afterwards, Yin learned about the previous situation and negotiated with Yao. Yao replied that he was past the deadline and ignored him, and also refused to return the deposit he had paid. Unexpectedly, on the 3rd of this month, Yin unintentionally discovered two rickshaws with the same license number on Xikang Road, near Macau Road. The license number was the same as the one he wanted to buy, 9263. He knew something was wrong and reported the information to the Police Bureau's Detective Division. Officer Feng Xiushan was dispatched to investigate and summoned Yao Fuqing, who then confessed everything. He was arrested and transferred to the District Procuratorate for handling.</p>

<p>Random Notes on the Basketball Scene</p>
<p>In the basketball league, the two strongest teams of the Chinese team, Ren Yu and Shan team, met and tied at the end. In overtime, the Shan team narrowly won by one point.</p>
<p>Ren Yu is still a team that can psychologically manipulate their skills. This is due to experience and expertise. Although the championship is out of reach this year, Ren Yu is still a team with the most potential.</p>
<p>The Shan team maintained its "fast" characteristic last night, while Ren Yu stuck to the rules. In the first half, He Lide of the Shan team found an opportunity and performed exceptionally, scoring repeatedly. The score increased to 17-10. The Ren Yu players panicked. Wu Xinyun, Wang Huaiting, and Yao Wenyit repeatedly missed sure shots. Only Shen Pengju was in normal form. The first half ended with a score of 19-10, with Ren Yu trailing.</p>
<p>In the second half, Liang Yongjia entered the game, and the morale stabilized. He rebounded under the basket, shuttled and passed, created a smokescreen, and shot quickly, showing his skills. Wang Huaiting, Yao Wenyit, and Liang Yongjia successively scored, especially Xiao Yao's two corner shots, which won applause. Ren Yu then went from 19-12 to 23-18, forcing a tie at 24 each. At this time, there were still four minutes left in the game, but neither side scored, resulting in a tie.</p>
<p>In the five-minute overtime, Lin Weicong scored. Ren Yu only scored one point from Shen Pengju's free throw. Ren Yu's morale was chaotic. The Shan team remained calm and ultimately won the game.</p>
<p>When the score was tied at 24 each, Yao Wenyit took a long shot before the buzzer rang. The ball hit the rim and bounced out. Otherwise, this shot could have determined the winner. Is this what they call the ball is like that? (Chang Nian)</p>

<p>Purchase Price of Drawnwork Fails to Cover Costs; Textile Management Committee to Find a Solution and Expedite the Issuance of Foreign Cotton Allocation Certificates for Various Yarn Factories</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The 27th regular meeting of the Textile Management Committee was held yesterday afternoon at the Municipal Government Conference Hall. In addition to the attending committee members, Zhang Yamin and Zhang Hanguang of the Garrison Headquarters' Yarn and Cloth Group also attended. The agenda items discussed were as follows: (1) The purchase price of cotton yarn for February, with the standard 20-count yarn set at 2.5 million yuan, was considered insufficient by various private factories based on current costs such as cotton and labor. Chairman Wu expressed that he would consider a solution and suggested that the authorities resolve the issue. (2) Regarding the portion of cotton yarn that factories can freely trade, private factories faced difficulties in replenishing raw cotton. If price controls were too strict, factories would be unable to produce. After discussion, it was agreed that private factories should list prices that were not too far from those of the Textile Construction Company. A solution would be sought after the central government issued price negotiation measures. (3) Regarding the expediting of foreign cotton allocation certificates, it was decided that the Textile Management Committee would urge the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee and the Four-Organization Headquarters to issue them quickly to various yarn factories. (4) Regarding the Southbound Yarn and Cloth case, the discussion was as follows: It was found that in January, the quota for southbound shipment of cotton yarn was 5,546 pieces and cotton cloth was 233,299 bolts. Various manufacturers had applied sequentially, and a total of 4,752 pieces of cotton yarn and 76,880 bolts of cotton cloth had been approved, leaving a surplus of 794 pieces of cotton yarn and 56,419 bolts of cotton cloth. In addition, a special increase of 2,400 pieces of cotton yarn and 59,679 bolts of cotton cloth was added. Within the quota, the applications for southbound shipment of cotton yarn totaled 2,089 pieces and cotton cloth totaled 9,250 bolts, leaving a surplus of 311 pieces of yarn and 50,429 bolts of cloth. It was proposed to merge this surplus with the February quota and redistribute it. In the ordinary case, the original quota was 2,967 pieces of cotton yarn, plus the monthly surplus of 794 pieces, for a total of 3,761 pieces. The original quota was 75,647 bolts of cotton cloth, plus the monthly surplus of 56,419 bolts, for a total of 132,066 bolts. In the special case, the original quota was 2,000 pieces of cotton yarn, plus the monthly surplus of 311 pieces, for a total of 2,311 pieces. The original quota was 35,000 bolts of cotton cloth, plus the monthly surplus of 50,429 bolts, for a total of 85,429 bolts.</p>

<p>Export Promotion Committee Attaches Importance to Export Smuggling Problem, Mostly Transshipped Abroad via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway</p>
<p>Since the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, the city's export business has remained stagnant. According to the person in charge of the Import and Export Industry Association, there are many difficult problems in promoting exports at present. The short time limit for foreign exchange settlement is felt to be impossible to develop. Furthermore, a large amount of exported materials have recently been found to be smuggled via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and transshipped abroad, which has had a major impact on Shanghai's export trade.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the secretariat of the Export Promotion Committee, the committee attaches great importance to the problem of export smuggling and plans to invite experts to form a special research committee to discuss countermeasures. However, now that the chairman of the executive committee, Bei Zuyi, has resigned, the problem can be decided after the new chairman takes office in the coming days.</p>

<p>Foreign Rice and Cotton Arrive in Shanghai</p>

<p>Banks and Firms Need to Suspect Assisting Productive Enterprises; The Central Bank Decides to Make a Final Loan; Rediscount and Re-mortgage Methods Remain Effective</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many comments on the Central Bank's failure to connect with commercial banks and firms and to fulfill its responsibilities as the bank of banks. To this end, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Central Bank. According to him, the bank does not make any form of loans to commercial banks and firms according to laws and regulations. However, when general commercial banks and firms are well-managed, especially when they need financial accommodation to assist productive enterprises, the bank can consider the actual situation and be the "lender of last resort" for each bank and firm. This kind of "last resort lending" fulfills the responsibility of the bank of banks. Last year, the method of handling rediscount, re-pledge, and re-pledge of exchange was established. In addition to the city, it has been widely implemented throughout the country. It is handled by commercial banks and firms organizing a banking syndicate. The industrial and commercial loan syndicate established by the banks and firms is dedicated to applying to the bank for rediscount and re-mortgage. Recently, the bank has urged the banks and firms to organize a re-pledge exchange syndicate, fully striving for the bank's efforts. Although there have been changes in the personnel of the bank, this method remains effective. However, it is limited to assisting productive enterprises. If it is not a productive enterprise, it is naturally impossible to enjoy this loan, so as to avoid increasing market credit and stimulating prices.</p>
<p>Amendment to Securities Exchange Arbitrage Method</p>
<p>The Securities Exchange previously established a method for managing securities arbitrage, which was amended again yesterday. The amended articles are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The broker of this institute accepts the customer's entrusted arbitrage transaction, which should be completed in the field, and must not be completed by internal transfer. After the transaction is established, the transaction order or list should be held to the audit department of the business office of this institute for stamping and certification.</p>
<p>2.  The broker's books of this institute should independently indicate the subjects related to arbitrage on behalf of customers, and indicate the words "arbitrage on behalf of customers" and must not be mixed with other subjects.</p>
<p>3.  When the broker of this institute conducts group arbitrage on behalf of customers, the account of each period should be announced to the entrusted persons.</p>
<p>4.  The broker of this institute conducts arbitrage on behalf of customers. In addition to the actual difference obtained from arbitrage, there must be no payment of interest or bonus for the principal delivered by the entrusting party, except for the corporate broker of the bank, money house, or trust company who is entrusted to arbitrage in the name of the broker.</p>
<p>White Coal is Scarce and Firm</p>
<p>The bituminous coal market is still sluggish. Although sellers have automatically reduced asking prices, buyers still have no intention of buying. The overall transaction was very slow. In addition to Hongji and Jiaozuo white coal blocks, which continued to be firm due to scarce arrivals and special sales, other Tongdeli and others were affected by the gradual increase in the arrival of coke, and the market was extremely depressed, with fewer and fewer people asking about them. With the gradual increase in the arrival of coke, market prices are not as chaotic as before. The price of medium coke is 1.3 million yuan, Pingxiang coke, Kaiping coke, 1.05 million yuan, Wusong coke Taiwan coke, 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Tung Oil Market Remains Weak; Export Volume Decreases Sharply</p>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Last month, the export volume of tung oil from the city's China Quanwu Oil Factory was 830 tons, and that of other merchants was 850. The export volume (to the United States) from Hong Kong was 490 tons, and that of other merchants was 200 tons. According to the factory's Secretary Che, the export of tung oil has encountered great difficulties after the In. price was lowered.</p>
<p>Yesterday's tung oil market remained weak, with few transactions. The price of Xihong tung oil (domestic sales of tung oil) was 390,000 yuan per barrel of 83 catties including the wooden barrel. The price of Hongjiang tung oil (same weight) was 250,000 yuan per barrel.</p>

<p>Foreign Tea Houses Had Few Transactions Yesterday</p>
<p>The red and green tea specially supplied for domestic sales has always been in a calm state recently. The reason is that the removal is zero and lacks. Therefore, people's hearts have not been able to prosper. In the foreign tea market, Jane Beauty, Needle Beauty, and other green teas are still asked about, but the market situation is generally similar in supply and demand, and there are few honors and disgraces. As for the black tea that the British house pays attention to, the market was not accommodating at the beginning of Sheng Kai yesterday, and the situation was very bleak. Suddenly, a group of cargo owners who were in urgent need of capital flocked out, and the transaction suddenly opened up, but the number of transactions was still not large. Only Wuchang Tea Company and Renji Foreign Firm had micro transactions in the whole city, and the selling price was slightly softer than the day before.</p>

<p>US Tung Oil Production Increases Greatly; Last Year, 47,000 Tons of Tung Seeds Were Produced</p>
<p>[Associated Press Boston, 5th] The Christian Science Monitor recently reported that the United States' tung oil production will create a new record. A total of 12 million tung trees have been planted. According to statistics published by the Department of Morning Industry, the United States harvested less than one ton of tung seeds in 1924, reached 6,100 tons in 1943, and last year's output exceeded 47,000 tons, making it one of the fastest-growing of the 52 major agricultural products. Seven thousand tons of tung oil can be refined from 47,000 tons of tung seeds, which is about one-thirtieth of the US paint industry's demand this year, or one-tenth of the pre-war tung oil exports from China to the United States. It is said that China's Yangtze River Basin, from Hankou to Yichang, produces about 150,000 tons of tung oil annually. After the outbreak of the war, China's tung oil exports ceased. Under the Japanese occupation for eight years, few new tung trees were planted, and the old tung trees were almost completely felled. Therefore, the current tung seed production has been sharply reduced, and China's domestic demand is severe. It is unlikely that there will be a large amount of exports in the next few years.</p>

<p>New Medicine and New Drugs Shanghai Medical Association Editor's Occasional Thoughts Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>The general public and our doctors often have different psychological concepts about the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.</p>
<p>The general public always believes that doctors can see everything clearly at a glance, and after an examination, they will have a definite diagnosis of what disease it is and explain it. The doctor's ability is like Zhang Tianshi. The doctor's two eyeballs are microscopes. As for the medicine, needless to say, what medicine should be used for what disease. If the medicine doesn't cure the disease, it must also reduce the disease, which is a matter of course.</p>
<p>Conversely, doctors don't have it so easy when it comes to diagnosing diseases and using medicines. There are indeed many diseases that can be easily diagnosed. After an examination, a diagnosis is made and it is known what disease it is. It is also common. However, there are also many cases where the diagnosis remains vague and inexplicable after examining for ten days or eight days, which is not uncommon.</p>
<p>When it comes to using medicine, it is only natural that there are only waiting and no special symptomatic medicines to be applied during the undiagnosed examination period. Even after the diagnosis is clear and the condition is clear, it is often not necessary to use any medicine for treatment, which is also a reasonable treatment. Because treating diseases does not rely solely on medicines. Medicines need to be used when medicine is needed to see the function of the medicine. When medicine is not needed, medicine should not be used. Using more medicine may instead harm the sick body.</p>
<p>However, the general patient often cannot hold the same concept as the doctor about diagnosing diseases and using medicines. They often have a different psychology from our doctors.</p>
<p>The general public's concept of medicine is really necessary to be eliminated.</p>
<p>Because this kind of concept of medicine is extremely unreasonable and extremely unscientific, it only harms the patient's body and has no benefit.</p>
<p>Immunity to Smallpox Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>What is immunity? It should be explained here! Epidemic is an infectious disease, like smallpox, measles, cholera, plague, typhoid fever, etc., are all infectious diseases, can also be called epidemic. Immunity is to avoid infectious diseases. When an infectious disease comes to invade, there is resistance, not being contaminated. This is immunity. It's like the world says after getting smallpox, one will never get it again, after getting measles, one will never get it again, after getting typhoid fever, one will never get it again, after injecting cholera vaccine, one can avoid getting cholera, after smallpox vaccination, one can avoid getting smallpox. This is all about immunity.</p>
<p>Now only talk about immunity to smallpox; smallpox has smallpox, artificially inoculated smallpox, artificially inoculated cowpox. Smallpox is commonly known as smallpox. It is a pox disease that is naturally transmitted. Artificially inoculated smallpox is to use the scab of a good smallpox to inoculate in the body of the child, teach him to be infected and develop smallpox. From the end of the Ming Dynasty to before the prevalence of cowpox vaccination, this method was used. Now all use artificial vaccination with cowpox. What I want to write about involves all three kinds. Some talk about immunity to smallpox, some talk about immunity to artificially inoculated smallpox, some talk about immunity to cowpox vaccination.</p>
<p>1.  Susceptibility</p>
<p>Susceptibility is when an epidemic smallpox poison comes to invade, our body's sensing and acceptance of being infected. It can be simply divided into three items: (A) Fetuses are susceptible to infection; if a pregnant woman gets smallpox, the fetus in the womb will also develop smallpox. Not only that, if the mother still has resistance (immunity) to smallpox, when the smallpox poison enters the mother's blood, the mother will not develop smallpox, but the smallpox poison in the blood can pass through the placenta (commonly called the umbilical cord) and cause the fetus to develop smallpox. (B) Newborns are also susceptible to infection; Joachimann has already</p>

<h3>Alumni of Chih Chih University Plan to Restore Their Alma Mater</h3>

During the Anti-Japanese War, you remained steadfast and unyielding behind enemy lines, your integrity was admirable, and all those who had benefited from your nurturing deeply respected you.

From then on, there was no gain in the first quarter, while the opponent increased dramatically to 20 to 1. In the second quarter, Xu Jingyun of Women's Green Red scored a goal when Snow White had 30 points (30 to 3). In the first half, Snow White won 42 to 3. In the third quarter, the young players passed the ball into the bottom of the basket several times and returned with profit. Wu Minjue was flexible and increased from 3 points to 12 points. This quarter was 56 to 12 (Snow White 14, Women's Green Purple 9 points). In the final quarter, they had already reached the end of their strength.

<p>Spring Abundance Defeats All Black</p>
<p>Li Xianzheng and Zheng Jiabiao of Chun Mao immediately scored three goals when they came on the court. After Jia Youliang of All Black scored a penalty, Zhang Shaoqing made two shots, and the situation was close (9-8). In the first half, Chun Mao had 23 points and All Black had 11 points. In the second half, Xuan Tong replaced Jia Youliang of All Black. The All Black team members always fell behind in each game, and there were often new players performing. Li Xianzheng was the most active in Chun Mao. Xuan Tong and Lu Dazhen of All Black were still working hard. In the last minute, both sides had a funny performance, causing laughter. The result was 46 to 28.</p>
<p>Shantou Team Wins Over Ren Yu: Shantou Team Takes the Lead</p>
<p>In the important match between Ren Yu and Shantou, He Lide of the Shantou team missed the first free throw. Soon after, he made two consecutive shots and took the lead with 4 points. Shen Pengju of Ren Yu returned a shot, scoring 2 points. When Lin Weilu of the Shantou team made a penalty and Shen made another shot (5 to 4), Shen Pengju of Ren Yu made a penalty, making it a tie of 5 points each. At this time, Shen Pengju and He Lide were fighting for control of the ball, and at 9 to 7, Ren Yu took a time-out. Ma Canxi of the Shantou team won the ball and, along with Chen Qingjiang and Cai Yanli, added six points, making it 16 to 10. Because it was related to the championship, the competition was extremely intense. At 17 to 10, Ren Yu took another time-out to discuss strategies. Chen Qingjiang then broke through, and Shantou took the lead with 19 to 10 in the first half. Shantou's defenders were competent, and the forwards were more fortunate with their shots than Ren Yu.</p>
<p>Desperate Chase</p>
<p>In the second half, Liang Yongjia of Ren Yu came on the court, and Yao Wenyi scored three shots, while Shen and Wang Huaiting also made good shots. The score increased suddenly to 23 to 20. Shantou only led by 3 points, so Ji Lankang was brought in to replace Lin Weizong. Cai Yanxiong made a penalty, making it 24 to 20. Liang Yongjia of Ren Yu made a long drive, and it was a success, 24 to 22, trailing by only 2 points. The spectators in the stands each had their favorites, and the shouts were deafening. One minute later, Liang scored again, making it a 24-point tie (5 minutes remaining). The referee announced at 4 minutes, Sun Guozheng was penalized, and Xu Zhongyi entered as a substitute. Shantou missed two free throws (Lin, He), which was a pity. Wu Xinyun of Ren Yu also called out Xu Zhongyi, who had been substituted. At that time, there were only 20 seconds left. At the last moment, Yao Wenyi missed a long shot, and when the bell rang, it was a 24-point tie.</p>
<p>Overtime</p>
<p>The overtime period of 5 minutes would decide the winner. Lin Weilu healed to the right and penetrated, scoring an empty-hearted ball, so he wanted to steadily advance to pass the time. Cai Yanxiong grabbed Shen Pengju's ball and was called for a foul. Shen missed a penalty by one point. Wu Xinyun missed a free throw, which was a pity. In the end, Shantou only won by one point, a 26-25 victory.</p>
