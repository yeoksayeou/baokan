<h3>張羣在平發表演說　闡明外交基本政策　對內不畏艱難實施憲政</h3>
<p>〔本報北平廿五日電〕張羣院長廿五日上午十時於燕京大學歡迎曾上發表政治性演說，對中國外交及政治政策有所闡明，題爲「三個三點」，張氏首闡明中國外交基木政策有三：　中國始終有其外交獨立立塲，中國爲求本身的獨立與自由，共外交政策，亦必爲達到此目的而努力，決不事事追隨他人。　對過去共同作戰的友邦，包括美·蘇·英·法在內，設法繼續增進友好合作關係。　對所有友邦相互間的國際關係，設法從中促進，這是我們在國際間應盡的義務。同時，從各方面說，只有整個世界和平安定的條件下，中國才能獲得適宜的建設機會。張氏繼說明中國獨立外交政策之實施：　如對否決權使用，我們主張行使有伸縮性及斟酌餘地，山於過度使用，恒使若干好建議不能通過，美國遂提出一修改辦法，我們則認爲修改憲章太嚴重，所應該的是應該限制否決權的使用，對有建設性的提議不該使用否法權，反之，有違反憲章精神，專爲局部國家利益的提議，則可以使用否決權。　在對朝鮮問題上，我們以符合朝鮮獨立自由的願望爲標準，北緯卅八度一條綫，把完整的朝鮮分裂爲二，現在朝鮮的人民很苦，聽說每天都有一兩千人越過那人爲的卅八度綫，向他處逃亡，所以朝鮮人民迫切希望恢復他們的統一和自由。在對這個問題上，無論蘇聯提議或美國提案都好，只要能解決朝鮮問題，而且符合朝鮮人民願望，我們都贊成，但是如果美·蘇不能解決，我們贊同交四國解決。　對日和約上，我們不願參加蘇聯不參加的會議，因爲蘇聯和東亞關係很密切，如果蘇聯不參加，許多問題的解決便感到困難，這次美國根議對日和約草案由十一國起草，蘇聯主張由四國起草，我們看法則是十一國中的四國是對日關係最密切的國家，所以起草和約的國家雖不一定必須四國，但必需包括中，美·英·蘇四國在內。至於表決方法，我們雖然贊成十一國的多數表決辦法，但我們主張三分之二的多數，必須包括四國中的三國在內。張氏末對內政問題亦提出三點：　發揚民權，結束訓政，實施憲政，政府將不顧一切艱難，予以實現。　改革政治，千頭萬緒，如機構組織，法令規早，人事制度，辦事程序，機關設備，公務員作風素養在在應予改革，故此不僅爲政治問題，亦爲社會問題，須轉移整個社會風氣才好。　軍政如制度確立，軍隊整理，軍制權責亦須大加建立改革。</p>

<p>〔本報南京廿五日電〕公敎人員生活貸款案，廿五日再度於立院例會提出，引起一塲激辯，並因牽涉建築貸款事，當衆宣布選官貴人貸款名單，會衆大譁，最後以貸款辦法不易實行，決議重付審査，並爲集思廣益計，將邀集參政會，監察院共同硏討良好易行之辦法。此案今日於會中提出後，首由財政委會委長劉通報告審査經過，並謂，目前公敎人員確已瀕於吃不飽，活不了之境地，對於工作效率影響殊鉅，此種現象實不容忽視。陳顧遠指出，按生活指數發薪，決非國庫所能負担，不若發行公務員公債較爲易行與有效。陳洪認貸款辦法困難綦多，與其變相，不如直接解決簡單，惟若按生活指數計算，國家財力不勝負担，渠建議底薪制度以五十元爲標準，按生活指數發給，五十元以上，則分別斟酌悄形，折扣發給。渠對政府機關間待遇不一，深致不平，行總一司機月入達二百萬至三百萬，而一立委所得者尚不滿二百萬，不平孰甚。原提案人劉志平舉出四聯總處所提供之中信局建築貸款資料，慨然謂：大官富豪旣富且貴，政府尚貸以鉅款興建巨廈，而我輩窮公務員，則呼籲無門，謀生乏術。據謂：政府貸款建屋其目的在繁榮與美觀市容，市容需要美觀，我們餓死，冷死，就看得了嗎？言畢，即請樓秘書長桐孫當衆宣讀名單，其間許多木爲有地有屋之達官貴人，貸款數通常爲一戶兩億，最少者亦有四五千萬。棋氏報告甫畢，劉不同即躍起發言，大爲憤慨，謂：此種低利貸款，僅達官貴人得蒙其利，何不推而及於全體窮苦公務員。孫九錄主張對此種貸款應予治究，至公務員待遇之調整，爲刻不容緩之事，而目前張院長領導下之政府，對物價上漲與因物價上漲而使公務員听蒙受之痛苦毫不注意，應建議國府責成政院，妥求合理辦法。甫自各地考察歸來之諶小岑指出，內地公務員待遇之低，有月入僅二三萬元者，欲其不擾民，如何可得？鄕村黑暗之基本原因即在於此，應亟加補救。夏濤聲主張建屋貸款大部份尚未貸出，應禁止其再貸於當有之私人，撥作公敎人員宿舍建築費。王毓羣精通會計，據渠估計，二億貸款在上海放比期，每月可坐得三千萬，有錢人更造屋，無錢人沒屋住，豈得謂爲公平。洪瑞釗亦慨乎言之，對政院冷視公敎人員生活，深致不滿，認政院不應繼續「虐待」公務員，渠主張請張院長蒞院說明。孫院長亦起發言，認舉辦公務員信用貸款爲書呆子辦法，決行不通，蓋貨款例須有抵押，公務員以何物作抵，豈以薪水作抵乎？國家有負於公務員，決不應主客易勢，變成公務員向國家負責。至按生活指數發薪，必致加速通貨膨脹五萬倍，決辦不到，不若採納陳委員洪所提建議，採用底薪制度，較爲易行，原提貸款辦法，應予取消，原案則應重付審査，並爲集思廣益計，應邀同參政會，監察院等機關共商妥善易行辦法。孫氏此一建議，會中鼓掌贊成，原提案人劉志平亦表示接受，即予通過，重付審査。</p>
<h3>調整公敎人員待遇監院提出兩項辦法官負生活應在同一水準</h3>

<p>第一辦法〔原則〕：調整待遇，使一般公敎人員，與生活享受特殊之文武官負相接近，以示平等。〔理由〕：目下一般奉公守法，廉潔自持之公敎人員，其生活之困苦，已至絕境，而地位特殊之文武官員，則憑藉一切便利，其生活並不仰給於薪俸，狡黠者且利用地位，貪汚資刧，度其窮奢極侈之生活。國家爲安定公敎人員生活計，爲提高行政效率計，爲振作紀綱計，對一般公敎人員待遇，不可不速加調整。〔辦法〕：　目前生活指數已漲至戰前五萬倍以上，根據官方所公布之統計，亦已漲至三萬一千倍，目前可照官方指數折半即一萬五千倍發給，以後每月調整一次，皆照當時公佈之指數折半發給。　以底薪的標準，按照每月生活指數分別等級支給，如每月卅元以下者，照生活指數發給，卅一元至五十元照指數八折發給，以上類推。</p>
<p>第二辦法〔原則〕：平均待遇，使生活活享受特殊之文武官員，與一般公敎人員相接近，而甘苦共嘗。以渡難關。〔辦法〕：　不論官階高低，本人及其家族之衣·食·住·行·醫·藥敎育·娛樂·完全由國家平等供給。此外每人每月按照生活指數二成發給零用費。　不論官階高低，均生活於一個水平綫上，全國上下同樣忍受飢寒，如英國現行者然。目下至低限度須辦到下列數點：高級主官與一般公敎人員生活享受完全平等。　一般公敎人員與國營事業人員之生活享受完全平等。　民營事業人員與公敎人員之生活享受完全平等。　實行一切生活日用品之絕對定量分配。　禁止一切奢侈品之流行與使用。　私人過分財產與物資，應予征用或征借。</p>

<h3>國營事業加緊出售　十二單位已估價　全經委會決議交監理委會審核</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿五日電〕全國經委會第十六次會議，廿五日下午三時舉行，王雲五主席，決議案如次：</p>
<p>報吿事項：　農林部所提之糧食增產計劃，經於第八次會議中予以通過，呈送政院後由政院發回，並提出兩點交議：（甲）是否可選用原有機構吸收人員？（乙）事業費之分配，經九月二日及九月九日邀集農林主管部門人員切實討論，決定利用原有機構如中央農業推廣委會等，其技術人員則由一千二百人加至一千六百人，兩年度總共經費定爲一千二百億元。　關於公用事業調整價格計算方式，其中多端尙待詳細檢討。</p>

<p>社論</p>
<h3>節約運動應先從上海做起！</h3>
<p>自政府上月公佈厲行節約消費辦法之後，上海各界爲擴大宣傳節約起見，特地組織一宣傳委員會，欲使上海四百餘萬市民，都能明瞭節約的要旨，並能身體力行；該會定於今晨舉行全市節約宣傳大會，以喚起市民的注意，從而轉移社會的風氣。我們看到節約消費辦法自九月一日實行以來，其效未著，故對於今天的全市節約宣傳大會，認爲意義特別重大，値得全市市民的注意。</p>
<p>我國社會自古以來，向來提倡節儉，並以此作爲立身處世的美德，所謂「儉以養康」，不論是家庭敎育子女，或是栄誤導靑年，也莫不以「儉」爲修身的根本。就是在中國農村社會，至今猶保持着樸實淳厚的風氣。但是在上海，因爲畸形的發展，造成今日驕奢淫逸的風氣。近百餘年來上海一直是租界，在外人統治之下，因爲中外風氣的逈異，竟成爲十里洋塲，紙醉金迷，不僅崇尙奢侈，而且道德墮落，淪爲萬惡的淵藪。及至抗戰期間，後方均實行精神總動員，而上海在淪陷區內，不僅未能受精神總動員的感召，反而受敵僞的荼毒，使上海更加墮落了。迨至抗戰勝利上海光復之後，上海的風氣，本可因此轉移，面目煥然一新，但是大家誤以爲在抗戰勝利之後，就是苦盡甘來之時，因此在生活方面，力求舒服，以致流於奢侈。凡是初來中國的外國人，一到了上海，幾乎不相信中國是一個貧窮的國家；這种畸形的狀態，不論從那一角度去觀察，即使在歌舞昇平的承平時期，也是不容許其存在的。何况目下正是我國戡亂建國最感困難的時期。</p>
<p>我國本是一個落後的農業國家，在經濟上向極貧窮，經過八年的艱苦抗戰之後，更是窮上加窮，農村經濟瀕於破產，民族工業無法興起，假如國內無事，而能集中全國的力量從事復興建國的工作，則人力必能胜天，我國自能有其美麗的遠景，但是不幸得很，共匪竟罔顧國家民族的一綫生機，據兵作亂，破壞交通，摧殘生產，不僅企圖以武力奪取政權；而且欲使中國經濟陷於破產的困境。幸賴政府洞燭其奸，毅然決然，下令動員戡亂，並頒佈厲行節約消費辦法，俾由全國朝野集中全力從事戡亂建國的工作。凡是愛國家的人民，都應該體念時艱，克已報國，本着「有錢出錢，有力出力」的原則，犧牲小我，而將其所有一切完全貢獻給國家，根本上就談不到個人的享受；切實奉行政府頒佈的節約消費的辦法，是人民對於國家所當負的責任，初無表示意見的餘地。這幾天來，上海市參議會正在舉行第四次大會，曾有若干參議員提出關於節約消費辦法的建議，使我們不得不促其注意，節約消費在目前已成了國策，在原則上是不容再加以討論的；至多在實施的技術上，尙有磋商的餘地。姑以禁舞一項而論，立即實行的後果，必使數萬舞女及以此爲生的員工失業，我們固然應該設法安插失業人員，不致引起上海社會的不安，但決不能因噎廢食，因爲不能解決這些人的失業問題，就根本反對禁舞；前綫的將士浴血戡亂，災區的民衆在飢餓綫上掙扎，而獨有上海歌舞昇平，試想這個强烈的對照將成爲什麽現象？還能談得上節約消費嗎？</p>
<p>我國社會上有一句非常通俗的成語，就是「吃盡苦中苦，方爲人上人。」白手起家的人，決非偶然，大半是靠了他本人的克勤克儉，始能成家立業；此在國家亦與個人相同。戰前蘇聯的五年計劃，所以能在四年內成功，其最大的因素，乃在蘇聯的人民能夠節衣縮食，把全國所有的物力，所有的人力，完全用之於五年計劃，雖一絲一亳，不浪費不糟塌；即在今日的蘇聯，也在那裏埋頭苦幹，希望能夠早日恢復戰前的狀態。蘇聯人民的節衣縮食，加速建國事業的成功，是我們實行節約的絕好榜樣。其次是今日的英法，英國是一個島國，平時衣食所需，均靠國外輸入；但是經過這次大戰之後，一則因經濟的困難，另則因來源的减少，使英國人民在生活方面，遭遇到極嚴重的困難，因此英國乃實行節約辦法，至今還保持着戰時所實行的配給制度，不分貧富，不論貴賤，一律憑配給證購物。戰後英國所以能安然渡過經濟的難關，也是靠了英國全國人民能夠束緊肚帶，忍饑耐寒，苦撑下去。至於今日的法國，在美元威脅下，一切因陋就簡，戰前以「銷金窟」　於世的巴黎，至今日仍舊黯然無色；但是回頭看看上海，表面繁榮遠甚於戰前，人力物力的浪廢，可謂達於頂點；我們有什麽理由可以聽任上海長此浪費下去？</p>
<p>要之，節約消費，在戡亂建國期間，全國人民均應切實　行，一般貧苦的農民，正在饑餓綫上掙扎的，早已節約到不可再節約；但是在通都大邑，尤其是全國富有者聚居的上海，驕奢淫逸，早已成爲社會風氣，每日的消費，實在驚人，自應首先切實施行節約辦法。誠然「風俗之厚薄，繫於一二人之心　而已」；我們雖然也希望市政當局以及社會領袖，首先身體力行，實行節約，爲民表率；但其成敗的關鍵，我們認爲仍在全市市民的身上，要大家一齊實行節約消費辦法，才會發生效力；否則都是表面文章，聊以點綴而已；決不會奏效的．所以我們要大聲疾呼，實行節約應從上海做起，如果這個運動在上海不能奏效，那未這就是上海市民的恥辱。</p>

<h3>歐洲糧荒美人不能坐視　杜魯門呼籲節約　并請拉丁美洲各國參加援歐工作　國會特別會議不擬召開</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕紐約廿五日廣播：今日杜魯門總統繼請美國人民竭力避免浪費糧食，藉以救濟歐洲今冬之糧荒。渠正設法以過渡性質之援助給予歐洲，而不擬召開國會特別會議，　召開國會特會並不簡單，而歐洲之需急援助，實屬急不待緩也。杜氏將於下星期一與國會領袖會晤，迅速援歐之問題，即為會談之主題。杜氏今日命令成立一公民糧食委員會，其任務即在糧食之節省與保藏，　使美國得有援助歐洲之能力，良以美國不能坐視歐洲之凍餒也。萊佛兄弟公司總經理勒克南，已被任命為公民糧食委員會主席。杜氏　請美國人民節省糧食，並非要求美國人民減少食量之謂，其要旨乃在減少浪費，須知美國人每年因丟棄麵包殘餘而浪費之小麥，數達七千萬噸之鉅。有人　以美國是否將恢復物價管制，杜氏答稱，此點胥視國會之態度而定。亦有人詢以美國是否將恢復配給制度者，總統則謂，需待詳細關查實際情形之後，再作決定。杜氏希望拉丁美洲各國亦能負擔馬歇爾計劃各項費用之一部分，美國政府將設法與拉丁美洲各國磋商。總之，凡有剩餘糧食之國家，均應慷慨解囊，以救他人之急云。</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿四日電〕杜魯門今日召開內閣特別會議，檢討糧食局勢。總統並與農業部長安德遜舉行會談，談論國際食糧局勢及國內農業問題。今日共和黨政策委員會主席塔　脫在西雅圖稱：國會領袖業已被召返白宮，定廿九日與杜魯門商討糧食問題。據稱，其　府辦公處已截獲通知，但渠至十月二日始能完成其四部旅行，故不克出席，范登堡將代表參院共和黨參加會議。</p>

<p>又市府爲「蘇北流亡失業工人請求發給郊區三輪車牌照案擬定三輪車移駛郊區實施辦法」囑審議案，亦決議保留。但對於參會第三次大會決議發給蘇北難民三輪車夫牌照一千一百七十張限專駛郊區一案，決仍執行。</p>
<p>參會三次大會對兵役法免役條例中「應負担直系親屬一人以上之生活者」一條，修正爲「應負担家屬一人以上之生活」市府認爲修正後範圍太廣，提請複議仍採原條文。參會大會昨日討論結果，採納陶百用建議，對「獨負家庭生計責任」一語請中央解釋，在解釋未到前，仍根據參議會之修正條文辦理。</p>
<p>大會昨一致通過，贊助遼寗省臨時參議會主張「徵借國人在美存款以資挽救經濟危機戡亂救國」一案，及天津區工業協會等團體電陳政府開放對日貿易意見三點。</p>

<p>至由政府收購一節，更萬不可行，擬請政府權衡利害，鄭重考慮。</p>

<h3>抵滬反正共軍　談「八路」內幕　給養極壊到處擾民知事份子監視嚴密</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國防部直屬步兵某團全體官兵三千一百六十一人，搭招商局海宙輪抵滬，泊虬江碼頭。記者昨晨往訪，據團長申德動談稱：本團同志大部係共軍反正，其中十分之六自動投誠，十分之三爲俘虜，亦有不少本係國軍被共軍俘虜而重行歸來者。又謂：「投誠過來的共軍質素很好，敎育水準極高，有高中，大學學生，識字比率佔百分之九十五。籍貫以山柬，山西與東北最多」。記者曾訪問二位「老八路」，一名張永德，北平人，一名高尚君，遼東人。據談，彼等加入「八路」根木是莫名其妙的一回事，因參加時祗知是「保安隊」。「八路」中士兵都稱「戰士」，「戰士」給養極壞，到處吃老百姓，穿老百姓。目前東北民衆一見「八路」開到，把所有可以吃的，穿的都藏匿起來。連級幹部以上，則待遇較好，薪水不論職級）律五十元一月，發的是「遼東軍區軍用劵」，五十元當東北流通劵一百元，可是老百姓當它廢紙，根本不能流通。軍中生活還相當自由，每一排有三名共黨黨員。韓共甚多，「大鼻子」（指蘇聯人）亦不少。現在共黨不希望知識份子入黨，並且對知識份子監視亦較戰密。四平之役，共匪把非黨員作前驅，每人發四個手榴彈打衝鋒，共黨黨員持重武器殿後，故非黨員犧牲慘重云云。</p>

<h3>「刧收」大員莫與碩·李節文　在穗槍決前後</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州廿日航訊〕十六日下午，由廣州行轅軍法處門口開出一部汽軍，上面擠滿了憲兵，押解着兩個犯官到北郊刑塲去。路上的民衆，還以爲是槍決日戰犯，到後來才曉得，原來這兩個犯官，就是曾經煊赫過」時的接收大員，後來正因「刧收」和舞弊，曾扣留審訊經年，最近才被判決死刑，並交由廣州行轅就地執行的：一個是前軍政部廣州區特派員公署中將特派員莫與碩，另一個是廣東全省護沙總隊少將總隊長李節文。</p>
<p>拍蒼蠅固多打老虎難得</p>
<p>這消息一傳出，人心大快，因爲蒼蠅拍得多了，打老虎還不多見，至少在廣州，像這樣槍決身居中少將的貪汚大員，這還是破題兒第一遭哩。</p>
<p>莫與碩是廣東陽江人，四十四歲。李節文是廣東東莞人，四十三歲。兩人都是黃埔早期生，草一曾任軍長，李曾任廣州社訓總隊長及中等以上學生集訓總除長，可是他們都辜負了國家的栽培，身居高位，仍貪汚枉法，殊堪痛惜。</p>
<p>淸全團來粵糊塗帳揭開</p>
<p>莫最初奉派返穗時，可算是接收要員中最有權勢的一人，李節文便在他的公署當少將主任，當時敵僞產業管理處還沒有成立，所以常時的軍特署，除了接收軍用品以外，連什麼洋房汽車等一切都在他們接收的範圍，而且當時許多東西都沒有移交冊的，當時一般民衆，對該署的接收舞弊，早已嘖有煩言。到了去年九月間，粵桂區接收淸查團來粵，這筆接收糊塗帳才被淸算，而莫李兩人，也就在這時候被看管，送到中央去審訊，莫是去年九月廿三日解返本市，李則於十月廿六日押解返穗的。</p>
<p>高等軍法會審查明軍械被侵</p>
<p>「這次他們兩人彼處死刑的罪名是：將接收之軍用槍械·共同侵佔運赴中山縣屬黃閣，橫檔，三角等鄕藏匿，計有輕重機槍百餘挺，迫擊砲十六門，步槍二千桿，另附零件及子彈七百餘箱，又莫串同所屬職員將接管汽車內胎二百餘條，掉換廢品移交圖利。」這案經國防部派中將署長彭位仁來　，組織高等軍法會審，訊明屬實，依法判決。</p>
<p>莫與碩寫遺書扯淡家用困難</p>
<p>法官在軍事法庭上詢問莫與碩及李節文兩人有什麼遺言？李負氣說：「沒有，沒有，什麼都沒有。「莫則執筆寫遺書致其妻，原文是：「眞妹：此次判決結果，軍人服從命令，無話可說。家庭事勞吾妹照料，想會處理很好，我可無顧慮。以後家用困難，可請各友帮助，我想毓琛及新中兄，胡軍長伯玉，及霍總司令崧山等可助也。與碩，九，十六，」遺書寫畢，兩人即被押往流化橋刑塲，行刑前照例享以酒肉，但兩人都謝絕了。五時三十分，前後檢聲四嚮，這兩個「刧收」大員，便在國法裁判之下，完結了這一生，並留給貪汚者以前車之鑑！（特派員梁風）</p>
<h3>莫李聞判　大·驚·失·色　莫與碩問：「何人批辦的？」罵李節文道：「吵什麽？」</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州日航訊〕此間審訊莫與碩李節文貪汚案的期間，流傳着一個傳說，據謂當時會審判決，僅係有期徒刑十年，後來這判決書送呈蔣主席，即立刻批處死刑云云，如果這傳說是眞的，我們也可見蔣主席嚴懲貪汚決心的一斑了。</p>
<p>蔣主席的手令是九月十二日批下的，十五日下午由專員乘專機帶來，十六日下午五時，便由軍法處副處長鄭宗遠升堂主審，將蔣主席手令宣讀後，莫李二人大驚失色，李更激烈聲辯，問：「誰人批辦的？」莫則强作鎭定，回頭駡李說：「軍人祇有服從，吵什麽？」李乃靜默下來，不再說話。</p>

<h3>受銀根緊影響華股漲勢稍</h3>
<p>華股昨雖漲而十分恍惚，掉期貼價因銀根緊迫而步昂，買氣雖盛，十分飄忽。永紗雖創高價，但不能持久，午後銀根更緊，國行交換者進甚鉅，多頭大批出籠，市價在恍惚中更漸感不支。</p>
<p>晨開</p>
<p>見高，開後成交忽見清晰而稍疲，各方多進，而自即交二六四元，遞交二七一元起，盤升至二六八元及二七九元，息價步昂，多方不無顧忌。經紛售而又見怯。塲外息價開高至二角五分及三角，十時半後，再迫低至即交二五九元，遞交二七一元低價，息價議定後買風立即重振。現永紗乃盤漲到即交二七四元，及遞交二八五元。乘高有了結，並賣現永紗，曾低至二七八元，多方肆意加碼，近午再將遞永紗拉上至二八四元，隔夜浮多，迫於時間，頗多供給，午收即交以二六五元，遞交以二八○元結束，現遞相差達十五元之多。是以午收後，遞永紗喊低至二七五元左右，結果較前收即交股計永紗美亞中法閘北中興新亞尚平，華豐勤興新華榮豐中紡中絲商務火柴麗安微升，華新跌半成，恒豐小挫，景綸水泥升半成，內衣漲起一成。遞交股計華豐升一成，信和美亞漲半成，永紗微升。</p>
<p>午後</p>
<p>聞黑市價又俏，上場見秀，乘高多連決資出，進者亦急切脫手，遞永紗逐步降低至二六九元，傳　大員蒞滬査帳，及自備外匯又有新措置也。賣意旣股，國行又差進九二九億，再迫低至即交二五七元，遞交二六六元。最後在二六○元及二七○元內外徘徊不已，收後喊價恍惚。結果較晨收即交股計永紗信和美亞華豐中法新華閘北榮豐中絲景綸麗安小挫，勤興火柴恒豐均平，中紡跌半成，巾與華新微升。遞交股計永紗信和美亞華豐均告小挫，塲外各老股平穩渝恒。</p>
<p>統益紗廠增資業已完成，定今日恢復買賣，成交單位定五萬股。</p>
<p>現處</p>
<p>奪利，昨息價布昂，約自一角三至二角光景，良以銀行帮頭寸有限，而多方擁塞不堪也。貼價永紗自八元半至十二元，而以十一元結束。信和自五元至六元半，美亞自十八元至二○元不等。多方事前向銀行帮預定者甚多，是以塲內成交反不見暢旺，二二三號二而四號一一六號貼出最多。</p>
<h3>減低證金全係謠言</h3>
<p>〔本報南京　五日電〕據財部息：近日上海證劵市塲時有證據金改爲三成之說，財部主管人稱，此項傳說，純係謠言。已由部電令駐所監理員查明造謠之人，依法究辦。</p>
<h3>統債盤升外股堅定</h3>
<p>公債，昨統戊尚平，餘債趨升，五○三室五三八室賣出，五五二室六一四室五五五室均進，成交增至七百萬。統丙晨開一二六○○元，自一二四○○元盤高至一三四○○元而後轉盤，結果較前收計甲乙升七○○元，統丙漲四○○元，統丁亦好六○○元</p>
<p>外股昨仍堅定，午後更俏，良以港申電縮至十元以內，買戶孔殷也。怡紗晨開一一二○○○元，午後盤升至二六○○○元結束，猶太商證券帮雖供，廣帮及洋行帮均進，結果較前收計怡紗墾植各升一成光景，怡啤鋼業航業各漲半成內外，餘股微升而已</p>
<h3>外匯及貿易辦法不變更　國行副總裁負責聲明</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕中央銀行劉副總裁昨日發表談話如下：</p>
<p>最近各報關於外匯及貿易辦法消息之記載，大都與事實不符。根據外匯平衡基金委員會一昨送來議至九月十七日之業務報告，在該會成立後第一個月內，外匯收入約達美金二千萬元，情形甚隹。雖其中一部份，係新外匯辦法公佈以前所積存之出口物品所結匯。但此後正適出口旺季，對於出口前途，頗爲樂觀。</p>
<p>至於進口所需外匯，無論官價市價，政府均照常充分供應。至進口限額制度施行以來，已逐漸步入正常，辦法決無改變之理。</p>
<p>關於金價，中央銀行係按每兩四十美元，依照外匯平衡基金委員會核定之市價折合。此項辦法，亦無變更。外間各種傳說，均屬無稽。</p>
<h3>紗布堅定</h3>
<p>昨日紗市，初開各方納胃仍健，人心頗佳，行情再漲，旋以銀根趨緊，市勢回挫，迨至近收時，因廠開不多，價　回堅。結果四二支藍鳳紗再創新高峯，爲二千七百七十萬元，比上日續漲一百八十萬元。其他粗細紗價亦一致續挺七八十萬至一百萬元。</p>
<p>昨日棉布，晨開散多逢高出籠，市面一度下瀉，旋至十點半許，因聞紡建公司又以低檔細布配售，且元嗶嘰無開出，致買氣復　，喊價由軟轉堅。迨至十一點三刻，紗價復漲，市價步步上升。最後各檔細布一致再漲七八千元至二萬元。其他漂布　嘰及士林布等，亦均續昂五六千至三四萬元不等。</p>
<p>紡建售布</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕中國紡建公司昨日循例售布，共售五六三○○疋，由購單共一四二七張。內廠商三九張，隅布五二八○疋。布號一三八八張，購布五一○二○　。</p>
<p>現棉軋升</p>
<p>昨日現棉市况先平後堅，紗廠以連日花價漲達高峯，進意觀望，同業因銀根緊俏，反進爲出，中間　勢一度稍疲，後以棉紗收盤再高，人心堅穩，空方抵補，交易再行展開。結果價格仍多軋升，全日成交二千包左右。</p>

<h3>中國美術史</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐　胡蠻著</p>
<p>羣益出版社</p>
<p>國內出版界關於中國美術歷史著述的刋行，數量不多，只有如下的幾本：</p>
<p>中國美術小史：滕固著：商務</p>
<p>中國美術史：鄭昶著：中華</p>
<p>中國藝術史概論二李朴園編著；良友</p>
<p>中國美術的演變；王鈞初著：文心</p>
<p>中國美術發達史：劉思訓著：商務</p>
<p>其中除李著及王著兩種斟酌採用科學的歷史觀寫成，其他大都是採用斷代的方法去寫，而鄭劉兩著，則又以繪畫，書法，建築，彫塑，工藝爲經而用斷代的叙述方法。我們在此雖然不能完全肯定地說歷史著述的方法應該走那一條路，但，至少，在近年來國內新史學研究的蓬勃雰圍中，依著較接近科學的歷史觀來寫，或者會比較易於　引起興味一點。我現在要介紹的這本胡著「中國美術史」，就是在這一種前提之下而著成的。</p>
<p>這本書共分十二章，大體上與王著的一本相似，不過比較充實一點，而且，在史料和考證方面，又有新穎的發現。例如：</p>
<p>關於「六法論」的源流，照日人金原省吾的研究，認爲謝赫的理論，是深受顧愷之的影響，這種說法，在中國繪畫理　領域之中，差不多已成定論。可是在這本書裏却是這樣的說着：代起「中國繪畫在當時受了西方美術的影響，從漢代起，彼斯商船往來到廣東貿易，到了東晋時代更盛，印度法顯大師，乘的就是波斯商船。在當時從波斯帶來了油畫的方法。……他這種油畫方法，雖然在晋代並不曾被中國畫家全盤應川到繪畫上，但是，在晋代繪畫上，特別在六朝帝王肖像上，顯然的存在着寫生的技術，如明暗法，即中國之「凹凸法」的來源。這種寫生畫法，爲形成「六法」之基本條件之一。其它，還相當的受了希臘和美　不達米亞等地方藝術底一般影響，在六朝陵墓建築中有希臘式的石柱和亞述式有翼石獸的彫刻，就是明證。並且，印度佛敎繪畫中之「沙達伽」（Sadanage）：　現象的認識，　正確感覺，尺度與結構，　形體上情感的　動，　雅典的侵人藝術的表出，　象形，　芙與色之藝術的使用。這六條雖然和「六法」的涵義不盡相同，但印度佛畫久已傳入中國，其畫法隨之而俱來實有可能。自從這些西方藝術逐漸傳入中國給與中國美術以新的刺激以後，到了六朝，遂有「六法」的產生，它是綜合的把西方的方法和中國以前所有的方法融合起來的新的繪畫方法。這就是『六法」的綱領的眞正的來源，絕不像謝赫本人故意神秘其說，並由此而不曾把「六法」給與相當的發揮。」（六○—六一頁）。</p>
<p>關於山水畫的南北宗問題，這是從董其昌以來的分法。輩氏嘗謂：「家有南北二宗，唐時始分，　之南北二宗，亦唐時分也。」（畫室隨筆），著者認爲這是腰斬歷史的論斷，書中是這樣的寫着：</p>
<p>「到了南北朝，在南梁有兩大畫家作了山水畫獨立發展的先　，同時，他們也成爲北派和南派的祖師，一個是張　　，他在絹上用靑綠重色畫出山峯，泉，石，邱壑，巉岩，而後加染彩色，這就是「靑綠山水」一派也所咫尺之間，便覺萬里爲遙。」這兩個大畫家，一個是鄭法士（河北人），他師法張增　，他的台閣　，得了這樣的評語：「狀石務彫透，繪樹多制　。」無疑的</p>
<p>「因此，我以爲山水　之分南北宗，它的來源起於南北朝之張僧　和蕭　，經過鄭法士，展子虔而爲南北二大派，到了唐代發生了所謂「南宗」和『北宗」，也就是宗法南派或北派的作風的意義。」（五七——五八頁）。</p>
<p>這一類的發見，我們認爲是獨到的見地，原來，著者從事著述本書的目的也是獨到的，在「序言」中說；</p>
<p>「美術的創作和美術的理論是有血肉關係的。要想獲得正確的美術活動的方向和美術創作的方法，就不能不硏究本國的美術的源　變遷和它的發生發展的規律，這就是說：必須批判的接受歷史的遺產。因此，根據着考古學上的發掘，實際上存在的美術資料，歷史上以及野史和筆記上關於美術的記載和各稱技術的書籍，加以綜合的研究和科學的分析，這是必要的，同時，要打破庸俗學者對於中國美術的誤解和曲解，打破審生在封建主議下的資本主義下的以及受了他們的「敎養」的遺毒底那些偏見。〕</p>
<p>從本書中我們可以消除的偏見是：　中國美術是孤立的偏見，　中國美術應該全盤西化的偏見，　中西藝術應調和的偏見。假使美術工作者能够站在人民大衆的立塲，這些偏見自然不打自破，中國美術歷史的眞象，也自然會非常淸楚地給人看到了。</p>

<h3>「中國地方志綜錄」</h3>
<p>— 季丹</p>
<p>近於商務印書館戰前出版朱士嘉編著「中國地方志綜錄」一書中，見其對「萍鄕縣志」，曾作如次之記載：書名卷數修纂姓氏年　代收藏機關萍鄉縣志　八　尚崇年修銓纂　康熈二二　北平。金陵。故宮。劉氏。日內閣。同　右　一二　胥繩武纂修　乾隆四九　金陵同　右　一六　黃濬纂修　這光　國學同　右　一一　陳喬樅纂修　咸豐十　金陵。國學。</p>

<p>案朱氏編纂是書，係就各收藏機關目錄徵引，似未根據原醫，因之於「萍鄕縣志」纂修人氏，年代，版本，不無遺誤。茲就同治十一年「萍鄕縣志」，及私人收藏原本，撰成「萍鄕縣志纂修沿革」一文，末附以表，今特引錄於此，試與朱書作一對勘。</p>
<p>萍鄕縣志纂修沿革表次朝　第別　成書年代　劵數　主修一明　正德十三（一五一八）　高桂二明　萬曆七年（一五七九）　常自新三明　萬曆十四（一五八六）　姚一理四明　萬曆二四（一五九六）　陸世勣五淸　康熙二而（一六八三）八　尚崇年六淸　乾隆四九（一七八四）三　　繩武七淸　嘉慶一六（一八一一）二○　張彭婦八淸　道光三（一八二三）六　黃濬九淸　同治十一（一八七二）10　王明</p>
<p>査朱書應補正者有三點。　：　濬纂修條，應補正爲道光三年。：　錫榮　修條，應糾正爲王明　，是志之修，係錫榮創修，至王氏始踵成之，見王氏所撰序。　陳喬樅纂修條，殊不可靠。今據同治十三年「袁州府志」，其中有陳喬縱撰「袁州府縣志　要序」，叙述甚詳：「咸豐九年冬，喬樅奉　檄權篆茲郡，下車之始，循故事索取郡志，板毀於寇，不可復得。　徵諸　志。皆以被寇之後，板籍已失，深用藍然於心。數月以來，於接見郡人士每從搜訪遺編，遂展轉覓得府縣各舊志，公餘之暇，手披目覽，思與郡人謀，重加採摭，增修新志，祗以屬多事困敝之日，力固未之逮也。顧念郡邑志書，實有關於政洽，新志縱未能續修，而併比舊志亦聽其就湮，母乃守士者之責歟？……喬樅爰取諸志，攝其沿革疆域都里城池山川水利關隘形勢田賦戶口學校公署兵衛武事津梁驛遞諸切要者，先付剞　。按之舊本，以爲傳信之徵；候諸將來，以爲續修之地，閱者尚鑒其苦心而勿以不全不備責焉。」同書卷首「歷修府志姓氏」：「咸豐庚申　刋，知府陳喬樅。」是則「萍鄕縣志」與「袁州府志」係同年重刋行世，並非正式纂修，不言而喩。是時適値太平天國失敗之後，地方政務，百廢待興，故陳氏亟刋此志，以爲施政張本。故該條亦應修正爲陳氏重刋，藉免傳訛。抑有進者，是書之中，類似上述情形，當復不尠。吾人甚願朱氏乘此各省縣文獻委員會成立之始，作一普遍性調査，然後將是書加以縝密修正，俾臻完備。余捐斯議，想我全國從事方志學者，亦樂於倡導贊助也。</p>

<h3>評「世界政治手冊」</h3>
<p>— 未央</p>
<p>在國際政治動態極端複雜微妙的現世界中，要了解各國政治的本質原非容易之事。各種論述國際政治的書籍，大多數不是失之偏傾，便是別具背景。　者在選擇之時偶一不愼，大有誤入歧途的危險。即以最近生活書店發行陳原編輯的「一九四七年世界政治手册」來講，雖然編者在前言中標榜着「力求用新的觀點和人民的立場分析各國政治經濟在戰時和戰後的演變及發展」，但是我們在讀畢之後，却深深地感到編者的態度是大有問題的。從書中許多地方可以發現：他是站在蘇聯的角度來看世界，站在中共的立塲來看中國！</p>
<p>這一種偏傾的態度在該書前言中「所用參考資料」一節已顯其痕跡，該節所列供編者參考之國內報紙除大公報文滙報外，其餘爲時代日報與新華日報。偌大的中國，幾千種的報紙，何以祇選擇這幾種。</p>
<p>書中關於中國部份，編者記述抗戰結束後國共談判及決裂經過，對於共黨之囂張跋扈野心企圖及背信毀約等事實隻字不提，而於字裏行間隱然將內亂蔓延的責任歸之於政府。並且更以三百餘的篇幅刋載中共所要求恢復的一九四六年一月十三日雙方的軍事位置。事實上大家都明白那時中共所保有的所謂「解放地區」乃是抗戰結束時間擴張地盤的結果，政府予以收復乃爲理所當然。編者之別具甩心，於此可見。</p>
<p>在「美國」一章中，首先攻擊杜魯門政府爲「倒行逆施」，並對民主黨與共和黨中的反蘇份于予以「反動派」的稱呼，繼則指出美國利用金元外交，向世界侵略。但對於戰後蘇聯活動所予美國外交政策的影響則予忽視，毫無論述。相反地在「蘇聯」一章中，關於蘇聯在戰後種種擴張領土的企圖以及對於我國不友好的態度均隻字不提，而對於第二次大戰初期蘇聯與德日訂立互不侵犯條約的行爲則曲意辯解。凡此種種，幾令人懷疑該書是否係蘇聯所出版？</p>
<p>全書其他部份，十之八九抄自美國外交關係協會編篡之一九四七年世界政治手册，甚至在編排程序上亦仍以各國英文名稱的字母先後為序，因此缺少地理上的聯貫性。書中附註之英文原名頗多排印錯誤，此外對於與國際政治有重要關係的各國地理位置均未介紹，尤爲該書缺點。</p>
<h3>從「靈山歌」的批語看　「靈山歌」</h3>
<p>照理我應該先看了「靈山歌」，再來看它的批評，而我却是先看了大公報梅林先生的「靈山歌的境界和品格」後，才不得不看一看「靈山歌」本身。因爲對於梅林先生在「靈山歌的境界和品格」所介紹出的「靈山歌」，不但我不能滿意，對他的介紹批評，我也覺有迷惑而空洞處。</p>
<p>現在以梅林先生所舉的「震動」和「凝視」兩首爲論例吧，從此中我們仔細欣賞玩味，所謂「品格」的表現，我認爲除了只有「唉唉，怎樣虔敬的驕傲，更是怎樣的驕傲的虔敬」，兩行是有點意味外，其餘我們不僅可以把它排成並不流利的散文，且如「田野度闊」，「然而我更君見充實和—遠美，「……心力萌生」，……育的大野」等詞句，似乎簡直有點堆砌的欠通，像「度闊」「遠美」「萌生」和「保育的大野」的辭彙，我們不但在口頭語中慣聽不到它，就述在過去文字的辭彙中，也難找得到。固然詩的精美在於簡煉而有含蓄，使能傳出直　以外的言外之意，弦外之音，至少也要能表達出他所要表現的某種形像和意境來。可是，我們並不能把它選作得如小脚婦人，或竟標奇立異而表現不出一點情味來。</p>
<p>再說到這兩首詩給予我們的印象，也不過是表現着智識份子的一種幻滅矛盾的情感泡沫而已，我們並嗅不到有什麼　洛米修士樣的英雄聖　的表現，只不過在作者個人的惑情小圈子中亂打轉，作者並沒有像雪萊，給我們更眞確的刻劃出那麽個偸火的普洛米修士，以及創造出超人意外的另一種境界。而梅林先生竟更空洞的以所有的形容辭彙，讚美了這種空幻，像這種評介，不知何所依據？我們從這本詩的本身，不能獲到一個統一漸進的究整概念，就從這篇介紹中，也不能藉着它的力量，獲得一個更進步的淸析印像。</p>
<p>「這血河的急漩的慘麗，這　破地殼的沉重，從生命與歷史與時代死命絞紐中產生，從最熾烈最決絕的內在鬥爭中產生，從靈魂的血滴，從鋼鐵的頑强，從火山的熾烈，從無歟的白髮，從無數的縐紋裏產生，從靈山相似的崇高的品格產生。……」</p>
<p>這是梅林先生對「靈山歌」的一大堆空洞而不着邊際的形容，但如我們從「最熾烈」而到「從火山的熾烈」的角度上來君「靈山歌」的境界和品格，更覺得是渺茫而不可捉摸了。我們不知道所謂「最熾烈」的是些什麽，而火山的熾烈又是種什麽境界品格？老實說，像這種以欠通而空泛的形容詞來論述任何一種作品，簡直是一秈瞎子說風凉的瞎　，根本不能抓着作品本身的痛　，無論說得如何動人，結果的效力恐　及共所讚着的萬分之一。因爲一個批評家的才能表現，並不能只用一套優美的形容辭彙，毫無依據的而完成他對作品所達成的批評目的，而是在從作品的本身的切近抽象和廣泛處，更能具體的恰當的指出它的得失，至於對作者的得失和利害，批評者更不能有所偏廢的。如梅林先生在第一段即先按下了什麼……」鋼圈似的逼人的冷光，聖者樣的絕對不屈的的莊嚴」的　大其詞的說話帽子，然後再作其自和自解的答覆；，用完了歷史上所有的空泛辭調，也不足以塗染事實的本質。那麽，說到「靈山歌」表現的境界品格，作者處世的態度，縱有使人可敬佩處，但從這表見條養的作品本身來看，我們不但不能和雪萊的「解放了的普洛米修士」相比，就述和郭沫若先生的「天狗」，也不能同日而語。現在議我把由於這種好奇所引起而讀過「靈山歌」以後的所見，略加論述：</p>
<p>「靈山歌」無擬的是用作者缺乏寫詩的修養以智識份子追求幻想的過剩的情感所完成的，所以在技巧方面，音調並不嘹亮活潑，意境的表現並不奔放超脫，惟其作者作人似乎忠懇，在老到的抒發內心的情感變化之間，也顯出了作者在詩境中所有的空幻矛盾。這一種態度，且當別論，說到寫詩，作者顯而易見是生疏，如所用的「退屈」，「灰白的映光」，「幽鎖在……」，這樣　美」和「遠美」，以及「永遠美光奕奕的生命」，「……光　的年代」等的詩句辭彙，與其說我們要想它明由通達非加註解暗語不可，倒不若說却是些見了脂肪調料的骨頭。</p>
<p>雪山歌的意境，也許就是梅林先生所謂「境界」，究竟遼遠深闊到什麽程度？我們從這册詩集的本身來看，它並沒有像雪來在造化高妙而不可知的界限中，仍舊刻劃一幅有時間空問造象的意境我們把這些詩和雪萊的「西風歌」，「雲雀」或高爾基的「海燕歌」相比，明眼人自不難體味出他們表現力的高低。</p>
<p>至如「擬視」和「震動」等，實不如病人意識糢糊中的嘆語，在意識淸醒的時候，他會說出好人難得想到的警語，在病情劇來的時候，他又會說出使你可怕的亂話，作者也不過在這種病人的狀態中而已，這也是作者寫作的天眞和誠懇處，從另一方面說，似有可採取處。若將這以之作爲就是「靈山歌」表現的最高境界，此誠不勝使人感覺唏噓迷惑之至。</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Delivers a Speech in Beiping, Elucidating Basic Diplomatic Policies, Internally Fearing No Hardship in Implementing Constitutional Governance</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 25th] Premier Zhang Qun delivered a political speech at Yenching University at 10:00 AM on the 25th, elaborating on China's diplomatic and political policies. The title was "Three Threes." Mr. Zhang first clarified China's three basic diplomatic policies: China has always maintained an independent diplomatic stance. To achieve its own independence and freedom, China's diplomatic policy must also strive to achieve this goal and will never blindly follow others. Continue to enhance friendly cooperative relations with allied nations that fought together in the past, including the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France. Promote the international relations between all friendly nations. This is our obligation in the international community. At the same time, from all perspectives, China can only obtain suitable opportunities for development under conditions of overall world peace and stability. Mr. Zhang then explained the implementation of China's independent diplomatic policy: Regarding the use of the veto power, we advocate for flexibility and discretion in its exercise. Excessive use often prevents the passage of good proposals. The United States has proposed an amendment method, but we believe that amending the Charter is too serious. What should be done is to limit the use of the veto power, and the veto power should not be used for constructive proposals. Conversely, the veto power can be used for proposals that violate the spirit of the Charter and are solely for the benefit of local countries. Regarding the Korean issue, we take the desire for Korean independence and freedom as the standard. The 38th parallel divides the complete Korea into two. The Korean people are suffering greatly now. It is said that one to two thousand people cross the artificial 38th parallel every day and flee to other places. Therefore, the Korean people urgently hope to restore their unity and freedom. On this issue, whether it is a Soviet proposal or an American proposal, as long as it can solve the Korean issue and meet the wishes of the Korean people, we support it. However, if the United States and the Soviet Union cannot resolve it, we agree to let the four countries resolve it. Regarding the peace treaty with Japan, we are unwilling to participate in a meeting that the Soviet Union does not participate in, because the Soviet Union has very close relations with East Asia. If the Soviet Union does not participate, it will be difficult to solve many problems. This time, the United States proposed that the draft peace treaty with Japan be drafted by eleven countries, and the Soviet Union advocated that it be drafted by four countries. Our view is that the four of the eleven countries are the countries that have the closest relationship with Japan. Therefore, the countries drafting the peace treaty do not necessarily have to be four countries, but they must include China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. As for the voting method, although we agree with the majority vote of the eleven countries, we advocate that two-thirds of the majority must include three of the four countries. Mr. Zhang also put forward three points on domestic political issues: Promote civil rights, end political tutelage, and implement constitutional government. The government will realize this regardless of all difficulties. Reforming politics involves many aspects, such as organizational structure, laws and regulations, personnel system, operating procedures, equipment, and the style and quality of civil servants. Therefore, this is not only a political issue, but also a social issue. The entire social atmosphere must be changed. Military administration, such as the establishment of systems, reorganization of the army, and the establishment and reform of military power and responsibilities, must also be greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 25th] Premier Zhang Lin met with reporters at Yishoutang in the Summer Palace on the 25th at noon, stating: China has its own independent and autonomous diplomatic policy, which will never change due to whether or not others provide assistance. Mr. Sun Zhesheng's recent conversation with a reporter from the Associated Press, its most important meaning is only to emphasize the autonomy of Chinese diplomacy. A reporter asked whether China is willing to mediate to shorten the distance between the United States and the Soviet Union. Zhang replied: Yes. The reporter asked whether Petrov would return to China. Zhang said: The Chinese Embassy in Moscow has processed the visa for the Soviet Ambassador, and the date of the Soviet Ambassador's return to office should not be far away.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Holds a Tea Party to Entertain University Presidents and Professors, Today Going to Zhangjiakou for Inspection, Trip to Taiyuan Canceled</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 25th] Premier Zhang is scheduled to go to Zhangjiakou for inspection on the 26th, and the trip to Taiyuan has been canceled. Mr. Zhang visited Yenching University at 10:00 AM on the 25th, and was received by Cai Yie, Mei Yibao, etc. As an alumnus, Zhang inquired about school affairs in detail. At 11:00 AM, he gave a speech to the students at Beigong Building, which lasted for forty minutes. Subsequently, the student union put forward several requests as follows: Please the government stabilize prices with effective methods. Please establish scholarships for private schools and treat public and private schools equally. Premier Zhang expressed sympathy and will submit them to the Executive Yuan for discussion. Students from Sichuan also sent representatives to ask Mr. Zhang to find ways to provide relief, and Mr. Zhang also agreed to find ways. At 11:50 AM, Mr. Zhang went to Tsinghua University and briefly met with President Mei Yiqi, and then went to Jingfuguo in the Summer Palace with Mr. and Mrs. Mei to attend the banquet hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Xiong Shihui. Those present also included He Siyuan, Mr. and Mrs. Du Jianshi, etc. After the banquet, they enjoyed a leisurely tour of the Summer Palace. At 2:00 PM, he entered the city and attended the welcome meeting of the Municipal Party Headquarters. Zhang delivered a speech, encouraging the Beiping Party, government, military, gentry, and groups to unite and cooperate, and under the leadership of Director Li of the Executive Headquarters, to strive for military victory.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Correspondent, 25th] Premier Zhang held a tea party at Huiren Hall at 5:00 PM on the 25th to entertain the presidents and department heads above the professors of national and private universities in Beiping. More than 200 people, including Hu Shi, Mei Yiqi, and Wang Zhengting, attended. Mr. Zhang said in his speech: This trip is willing to see more, listen more, and unwilling to say more. Mr. Zhang reiterated the valuable suggestions of educational workers to the government at the Lushan Talks before the July 7th Incident, and is willing to learn from them to help solve the current difficult situation. He then briefly explained the current difficult situation of the government and its administrative policies, emphasizing the reflection on the shortcomings criticized by others, reaffirming the independent diplomatic policy, and asking all parties to understand this financial difficulty, and revealed that the salaries of public educators will be adjusted again in November. Subsequently, Hu Shi delivered a response on behalf of the attendees. He said: Under the current situation where we cannot get enough to eat and wear, we only hope to explain the principles of salary adjustment. Mr. Hu reiterated and explained the two principles (see page 9 of yesterday's newspaper) decided by the Peking University Faculty Association on the 23rd, saying that he hoped that these principles could be extended to general public educators, so as to maintain a minimum standard of living, and requested the allocation of food, coal, and cloth in kind. Subsequently, Wang Zhenrui, director of the Department of Psychology at Yenching University, made supplementary explanations. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Suggests the National Government Discuss and Handle the National Federation of Commerce</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The Legislative Yuan believes that the National Federation of Commerce published a large advertisement in the newspaper, openly insulting the National Government and the Legislative Yuan. During the meeting last week, Legislator Chen Guyuan made a temporary motion to suggest that the National Government impose sanctions. The case has been passed by the 334th regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan today, and it was resolved to suggest that the National Government instruct the competent supervisory authority to discuss and handle it in accordance with the law. When the case was brought up at the meeting today, the original proposer, Chen Guyuan, stood up and explained briefly that the Legislative Yuan's proposal of this case is to maintain discipline and is justified. The government should instruct the competent supervisory authority to discuss and handle it in accordance with the law. Liu Butong said: "In recent years, merchants have become increasingly arrogant and unusually domineering. Most of the government's tax revenue is taken from farmers, and occasionally taken from merchants, who use petitions and strikes as a threat. If this continues, it is really unbearable. This behavior fully demonstrates their arrogance. I still maintain that the activities of the Chamber of Commerce should be suspended, reorganized in accordance with the law, and the few responsible persons in Shanghai should be punished." Liu Zhiping, Chen Haicheng and others also expressed their opinions.</p>
<h3>List of Construction Loans Read Out in the Legislative Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The list of construction loans being piloted by the China Trust Bureau was read out in the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 25th.

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] Regarding the voting date of the general election, the competent authorities have recently decided to extend it, and it will be implemented after being discussed and approved by the State Council on the 26th. The original voting date is imminent, and the nomination procedures for candidates from various units have not yet been completed. Even the various units under the Kuomintang have failed to report on schedule. As for the party nominations discussed by the three parties, there is no result yet, so the deadline for the three parties to jointly nominate candidates for the National Assembly representatives on the 27th of this month has to be extended. The Central Election Guidance Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 25th and decided to postpone it for 10 to 20 days. In addition, representatives of election offices at all levels and election offices of various special units gathered at the National Government on the 24th for important discussions, discussing the technical issues of extending the voting deadline.

<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The case of increasing the quota of National Assembly representatives and legislators for industry and commerce groups was passed by the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 25th, and the allocation method has also been decided. According to the original quota of 31 National Assembly representatives for industry and commerce groups, the State Council decided to increase it to 48 at the meeting on the 12th of this month, and this case has now been passed by the Legislative Yuan. As for the allocation method, the suggestion of the Ministry of Social Affairs was adopted, and it was decided that there would be 44 commercial representatives, including four women representatives, and 24 industrial representatives, including two women representatives. The original quota of legislators for industry and commerce groups was 15, and the State Council decided to increase it to 20 at the meeting last month, and the Yuan also passed it without objection. As for the allocation method, there will be 10 for commercial groups and 10 for industrial and mining groups. In addition, the conference discussed the following important cases related to elections: National Assembly Quota Allocation Table. The remarks in the table of representatives elected by women's groups should the restriction "National women's groups are limited to those who have more than five branches in each province and city and whose membership books of each branch have been filed with the Ministry" be removed? After this case was raised, Liu Ke explained it first, saying briefly: According to the People's Organization Law, national people's organizations are not required to have five branches. In addition, time is short, and it is too late to organize now. It seems appropriate to delete it. Female legislator Tan Tiwu argued strongly, believing that it was impossible, and pointed out that since it is called a national women's group, it should have branches in various places. If a few people in Nanjing use family or personal relations to organize a group under a false name as a tool for future elections, it would be unreasonable and inconsistent with the initial intention of promoting women's rights. Several male legislators had different opinions, and the final resolution was to retain the remarks, that is, national women's groups are limited to those who have more than five branches. Amendment to Articles 5, 6, and 10 of the Supervisory Committee's Election and Recall Regulations and Article 11 of the Implementing Regulations. There was a heated debate on Article 10 during the discussion, which lasted for an hour. It was resolved that the third paragraph should be changed to "If the number of elected candidates is insufficient, another vote should be held in accordance with the law until the number is filled." The others were passed according to the review opinions. Amendment to Articles 21 and 25 of the Implementing Regulations of the Supervisory Committee's Election and Recall, passed according to the review opinions, without the need for amendment.</p>
<h3>Government to Issue Huge Sum to Build Xinjiang Industry, Military Control Zone Headquarters Established in Dihua</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Nanjing, 25th] The Chinese government is following the Truman Doctrine and planning a "money" policy in hopes of alleviating ethnic rebellion in Xinjiang Province. This is the new five-year construction plan drafted by Zhang Zhizhong and Maisiwude. According to the Information Bureau, Zhang Zhizhong has submitted the plan to Chairman Jiang for approval by the Executive Yuan. Mr. Zhang admitted that the purpose of the plan is to improve the people's living standards and alleviate the opposition between the government and the Yili ethnic group. It is reported that the government has approved an appropriation of 25 billion to carry out the plan, which will first develop the province's hydropower, steel, coal, and gold mining industries.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] According to the military news agency, the Ministry of National Defense has been approved to set up a military control zone headquarters in Xinjiang, which has been officially established in Dihua.

<h3>Government Employee Living Loan Case, Legislative Yuan Resolves to Re-Submit for Review</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The case of living loans for public educators was raised again at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 25th, causing a heated debate. Because it involved the construction loan issue, the list of loans for officials and dignitaries was announced in public, causing a great uproar. Finally, because the loan method was not easy to implement, it was resolved to re-submit it for review. In order to gather ideas, the Political Participation Council and the Control Yuan will be invited to jointly discuss a good and easy-to-implement method. After this case was raised at the meeting today, Liu Tong, chairman of the Finance Committee, first reported on the review process, saying that the current public educators are indeed on the verge of not being able to eat enough or live, which has a significant impact on work efficiency. This phenomenon cannot be ignored. Chen Guyuan pointed out that paying salaries according to the cost of living index is definitely not something the national treasury can afford. It would be easier and more effective to issue government employee bonds. Chen Hong believes that there are many difficulties in the loan method. Instead of changing it, it is better to directly solve it simply. However, if calculated according to the cost of living index, the national financial resources cannot afford it. He suggested that the basic salary system should be based on 50 yuan, and issued according to the cost of living index. For those above 50 yuan, the situation should be considered separately and issued with a discount. He expressed deep dissatisfaction with the uneven treatment among government agencies. A driver of the Executive Headquarters earns 2 million to 3 million yuan per month, while a legislator earns less than 2 million yuan. How can it be fair? The original proposer, Liu Zhiping, cited the information on construction loans from the China Trust Bureau provided by the Four Joint Offices, and said with emotion: Rich and powerful officials are already rich and noble, and the government still provides huge loans to build huge buildings, while our poor civil servants have no way to appeal and lack the means to make a living. It is said that the government's purpose in lending money to build houses is to prosper and beautify the city. The city needs to be beautiful, but can we bear to see us starve and freeze to death? After speaking, he asked Secretary-General Lou Tongsun to announce the list in public. Many of them were rich and powerful officials who had land and houses. The loan amount was usually 200 million per household, and the least was 40 to 50 million. As soon as his report was completed, Liu Butong jumped up to speak, greatly indignant, saying: This kind of low-interest loan only benefits the rich and powerful officials. Why not extend it to all poor civil servants? Sun Jiulu advocated that this kind of loan should be investigated. As for the adjustment of civil servant salaries, it is a matter of urgency. However, the current government under the leadership of Premier Zhang does not pay attention to the rising prices and the suffering of civil servants caused by the rising prices. It should be suggested that the National Government instruct the Executive Yuan to seek a reasonable solution. Chen Xiaocen, who had just returned from inspections in various places, pointed out that the salaries of civil servants in the inland areas are so low that some only earn 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per month. How can they not disturb the people? The basic reason for the darkness in the countryside lies in this, and it should be remedied as soon as possible. Xia Taosheng advocated that most of the housing loans have not yet been lent out, and it should be prohibited from being lent to private individuals who already have them, and should be allocated for the construction of dormitories for public educators. Wang Yuqun, who is proficient in accounting, estimated that a loan of 200 million in Shanghai could earn 30 million per month. The rich build more houses, and the poor have no houses to live in. Can it be said to be fair? Hong Ruizhao also said with emotion, expressing deep dissatisfaction with the Executive Yuan's disregard for the lives of public educators, believing that the Executive Yuan should not continue to "abuse" civil servants. He advocated that Premier Zhang be invited to the Yuan to explain. President Sun also spoke, believing that running a government employee credit loan is a bookish method that will not work. Loans must have collateral. What can civil servants use as collateral? Can they use their salaries as collateral? The country owes a debt to civil servants, and it should never change the situation so that civil servants are responsible to the country. As for paying salaries according to the cost of living index, it will inevitably accelerate inflation by 50,000 times, and it will definitely not work. It is better to adopt the basic salary system suggested by Committee Member Chen Hong, which is easier to implement. The original loan method should be canceled, and the original case should be re-submitted for review. In order to gather ideas, the Political Participation Council, the Control Yuan, and other agencies should be invited to jointly discuss a proper and easy-to-implement method. President Sun's suggestion was applauded at the meeting. The original proposer, Liu Zhiping, also expressed his acceptance and passed it immediately, and re-submitted it for review.</p>
<h3>Adjusting the Salaries of Public School Teachers and Civil Servants: The Control Yuan Proposes Two Methods to Ensure Government Officials Maintain the Same Standard of Living</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] "A proposal to adjust the salaries of public school teachers and civil servants to maintain their livelihoods and consolidate the foundation of the nation" was passed by the Control Yuan's morning discussion meeting on the 25th. More than 20 members of the Control Yuan signed the proposal, which was then submitted to the Executive Yuan. The proposal was drafted by three members of the Control Yuan, Wan Can, Li Shijun, and Yu Shude, and contains two proposed methods:</p>
<p>First Method [Principle]: Adjust salaries to bring general public school teachers and civil servants closer to the standard of living enjoyed by civil and military officials with special privileges, demonstrating equality. [Reason]: Currently, the hardships faced by general public school teachers and civil servants who are honest, law-abiding, and self-disciplined have reached a desperate point. Meanwhile, civil and military officials with special status rely on various advantages, their livelihoods not dependent on their salaries. Cunning individuals even exploit their positions to embezzle and plunder, leading extravagant lives. For the sake of stabilizing the livelihoods of public school teachers and civil servants, improving administrative efficiency, and revitalizing discipline, it is imperative to quickly adjust the salaries of general public school teachers and civil servants. [Methods]: Currently, the cost of living index has risen to over 50,000 times the pre-war level. According to official statistics, it has risen to 31,000 times. Salaries can be issued at half the official index, i.e., 15,000 times. Thereafter, adjustments should be made monthly, based on half the officially published index at the time. Based on the standard of base salary, stipends should be provided according to different levels of the monthly cost of living index. For example, those with monthly salaries below $30 should be paid according to the cost of living index; those with salaries between $31 and $50 should be paid at 80% of the index, and so on.</p>
<p>Second Method [Principle]: Equalize salaries to bring the standard of living enjoyed by civil and military officials with special privileges closer to that of general public school teachers and civil servants, sharing both joys and hardships to overcome the difficulties. [Methods]: Regardless of official rank, the clothing, food, housing, transportation, medical care, education, and entertainment of the individual and their family should be provided equally by the state. In addition, each person should be given a monthly allowance equivalent to 20% of the cost of living index. Regardless of official rank, everyone should live at the same standard, enduring hunger and cold together, as is currently practiced in England. At a minimum, the following points must be achieved: Senior officials should enjoy the same standard of living as general public school teachers and civil servants. General public school teachers and civil servants should enjoy the same standard of living as employees of state-owned enterprises. Employees of private enterprises should enjoy the same standard of living as public school teachers and civil servants. Implement absolute rationing of all daily necessities. Prohibit the circulation and use of all luxury goods. Excess private property and resources should be requisitioned or borrowed.</p>

<h3>State-Owned Enterprises to Be Sold Off More Quickly; Valuation of Twelve Units Completed; Full Economic Commission Resolves to Submit to the Supervision Committee for Review</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The 16th meeting of the National Economic Commission was held at 3:00 PM on the 25th, chaired by Wang Yunwu. Resolutions were as follows:</p>
<p>Reporting Items: The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's plan to increase grain production was approved at the 8th meeting and submitted to the Executive Yuan, which returned it with two points for discussion: (A) Can existing institutions be used to absorb personnel? (B) The allocation of project funds. After gathering the relevant departments of agriculture and forestry on September 2nd and September 9th for thorough discussion, it was decided to use existing institutions such as the Central Agricultural Extension Committee, increasing the number of technical personnel from 1,200 to 1,600. The total cost for the two years was set at 120 billion yuan. Regarding the calculation method for adjusting the prices of public utilities, many details still need to be thoroughly reviewed.</p>
<p>Discussion Items: The Executive Yuan submitted a draft amendment to the inheritance tax law submitted by the Ministry of Finance. The meeting conducted a general discussion on the principles and resolved to appoint six committee members, Yu Hongjun, Xu Kan, Liu Zhendong, Deng Feihuang, Chen Fang, and Sun Longji, to conduct a preliminary review. Regarding the issue of accelerating the sale of state-owned enterprises, the valuations of twelve units have been submitted to the meeting. It was decided to submit the valuations of these twelve units to the State-Owned Enterprise Sales Supervision Committee for review. (It is said that the valuation for the sale of the China Textile Company will be submitted to the meeting by the end of the month.) The meeting also conducted a general review of the price issue, which lasted a long time.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] During the discussion of the draft amendment to the inheritance tax law at the regular meeting of the Full Economic Commission, it was generally agreed that inheritance tax is a good tax and should be levied. However, the original draft has been in existence for too long, and many aspects are inconsistent with the current situation. For example, the Ministry of Finance proposed a starting point of 30 million yuan, but at the current value of 30 million, almost everyone has that much, and levying tax on everyone would inevitably disturb the people. At the same time, there is no investigation of property in our country, and the Law on the Use of Names passed by the Legislative Yuan has not been implemented, coupled with the fact that Chinese people have no habit of paying inheritance tax, there are many difficulties, and it seems that these have not been considered in the articles. There are also no explicit provisions for rewarding self-reporting, and methods should be found to remedy these. Some at the meeting also argued that inheritance tax should not be levied, but this did not gain widespread support.</p>
<h3>United Relief Association Approves Loan for Shaanxi Cotton</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The United Relief Association held its 353rd board meeting on the morning of the 25th, with Yu Hongjun acting as chairman.

<h3>Goods Shipped to America by Overseas Chinese Merchants Detained for Poor Quality; Chinese Chamber of Commerce in San Francisco Demands Return</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 24th] Overseas Chinese merchants here held a meeting at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce last night to find ways to request the United States to return the pure food, drugs, and cosmetics that they imported into China. Our Consul General Zhang Zichang guaranteed his assistance in seeking a solution. Several American customs brokers are also working to release the goods currently detained in the port. Authorities released the following reasons for detaining the pure food and drugs: Most of the goods are stale and rotten. Infested with insects and partially rotten. Unauthorized dyes. Chinese medicines contain unapproved treatments and no ingredient labels. No English labels. Among the food items, sausages, preserved duck stomachs, etc., are mostly moldy, rotten, and infested with insects. During the four-hour discussion, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce decided to translate the reasons for the detention into Chinese and send them to Chinese manufacturers, transporters, and exporters for future reference. Currently, many goods have been frozen here. The authorities will generally decide on the interpretation of other ports in the United States. If the bureau decides to reject these imports, it will surely ruin the livelihoods of some Chinese merchants. Otherwise, Chinese manufacturers and exporters must quickly improve their products in accordance with US regulations.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Movement to Conserve Should Begin in Shanghai!</h3>
<p>Since the government announced the "Strictly Implement Economical Consumption Measures" last month, various sectors in Shanghai have organized a propaganda committee to expand the promotion of conservation, aiming to ensure that over four million citizens of Shanghai understand the essence of conservation and can put it into practice. The committee is scheduled to hold a city-wide conservation propaganda conference this morning to raise public awareness and thereby shift social attitudes. We have observed that the effectiveness of the "Economical Consumption Measures" has not been significant since their implementation on September 1st. Therefore, we believe that today's city-wide conservation propaganda conference holds particular importance and deserves the attention of all citizens.</p>
<p>Our society has traditionally promoted frugality as a virtue for self-cultivation and conduct. The saying "Frugality nurtures well-being" implies that whether it is family education of children or the misleading of young people, "frugality" is the foundation for cultivating oneself. Even in Chinese rural society, the spirit of simplicity and sincerity is still maintained. However, in Shanghai, due to its abnormal development, an extravagant and dissolute atmosphere has emerged. For over a century, Shanghai has been a concession, under foreign rule. Due to the vast differences between Chinese and foreign customs, it has become a decadent "ten-mile foreign field", indulging in extravagant pleasures. Not only is luxury admired, but morality has also declined, turning it into a breeding ground for all evils. During the War of Resistance, the rear areas implemented a general mobilization of the spirit, but Shanghai, being in the occupied area, not only failed to be inspired by this mobilization but was instead poisoned by the enemy and puppet regimes, causing Shanghai to become even more degenerate. After the victory of the War of Resistance and the restoration of Shanghai, the atmosphere in Shanghai could have changed and been renewed. However, people mistakenly believed that after the victory of the War of Resistance, it was time for the end of suffering and the beginning of happiness. Therefore, in their lives, they sought comfort, which led to extravagance. Any foreigner who comes to China for the first time, upon arriving in Shanghai, almost cannot believe that China is a poor country. This abnormal state, from any perspective, is unacceptable even during peaceful times of prosperity, let alone during this most difficult period of suppressing rebellion and building the nation.</p>
<p>Our country is originally a backward agricultural nation, extremely poor economically. After eight years of arduous war, it has become even poorer. The rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and national industries cannot rise. If there were no internal troubles and the nation's strength could be focused on reconstruction, human effort would surely overcome fate, and our country would have a bright future. However, unfortunately, the communist bandits disregard the nation's lifeline, rebel by force, destroy transportation, and ruin production, not only attempting to seize power by force but also to plunge the Chinese economy into a bankrupt state. Fortunately, the government recognized their treachery and resolutely ordered mobilization to suppress the rebellion, and issued measures to strictly implement economical consumption, so that the entire country, from the government to the people, can concentrate all efforts on suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. All patriotic people should be mindful of the difficulties of the times, restrain themselves, and serve the country, based on the principle of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength", sacrificing the individual for the sake of the greater good, and completely dedicating everything to the country. There should be no talk of personal enjoyment. Faithfully implementing the government's conservation measures is the responsibility of the people to the country, and there is no room for expressing opinions. In recent days, the Shanghai Municipal Council has been holding its fourth congress, and some councilors have raised suggestions regarding the "Economical Consumption Measures", which compels us to urge them to pay attention: economical consumption has now become a national policy and is not subject to further discussion in principle. At most, there is room for consultation on the technicalities of implementation. Taking the prohibition of dancing as an example, the immediate implementation will inevitably cause tens of thousands of dancers and employees who depend on it for their livelihood to lose their jobs. We should, of course, find ways to resettle the unemployed to avoid causing unrest in Shanghai society, but we must not throw out the baby with the bathwater; we cannot fundamentally oppose the ban on dancing simply because we cannot solve the unemployment problem of these people. Soldiers on the front lines are fighting to suppress the rebellion, and people in disaster areas are struggling on the brink of starvation, while Shanghai alone is enjoying peace and prosperity with singing and dancing. Imagine what this stark contrast will become? How can we still talk about economical consumption?</p>
<p>There is a very common saying in our society, "One must endure the greatest suffering to become the greatest among men." People who start from scratch do not succeed by chance; most of them rely on their own diligence and frugality to build a career. The same applies to the nation as to the individual. The Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan was successful in four years because the Soviet people were able to tighten their belts, using all the nation's resources and manpower entirely for the Five-Year Plan, without wasting a single penny. Even today, the Soviet Union is working hard, hoping to restore the pre-war state as soon as possible. The Soviet people's frugality has accelerated the success of national construction, which is an excellent example for us to follow in implementing conservation. The second example is today's Britain and France. Britain is an island nation, and normally relies on imports for its food and clothing. However, after the war, due to economic difficulties and reduced sources, the British people have faced extremely severe difficulties in their lives. Therefore, Britain implemented conservation measures and still maintains the rationing system implemented during the war. Regardless of rich or poor, noble or humble, everyone buys goods with ration cards. After the war, Britain was able to safely overcome economic difficulties because the entire British people were able to tighten their belts, endure hunger and cold, and persevere. As for today's France, under the threat of the US dollar, everything is simplified. Paris, which was known as a "money-burning pit" before the war, is still dull today. But looking back at Shanghai, its superficial prosperity is far greater than before the war, and the waste of manpower and resources has reached its peak. What reason do we have to allow Shanghai to continue to waste like this?</p>
<p>In conclusion, during the period of suppressing rebellion and building the nation, the entire people should conscientiously implement economical consumption. The general impoverished farmers, struggling on the brink of starvation, have already conserved to the point where they cannot conserve any further. However, in large cities, especially Shanghai, where the wealthy gather, extravagance and dissipation have become a social atmosphere, and daily consumption is truly astonishing. Shanghai should first conscientiously implement conservation measures. Indeed, "The richness or thinness of customs depends on the hearts of one or two people." Although we also hope that municipal authorities and social leaders will take the lead in practicing conservation and set an example for the people, we believe that the key to success or failure lies in the citizens of the city. Only when everyone implements economical consumption measures together will it be effective; otherwise, it will all be superficial and merely for show, and will not be effective. Therefore, we must loudly advocate that implementing conservation should start in Shanghai. If this movement cannot be effective in Shanghai, then this is the shame of the citizens of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Europe's Food Crisis Cannot Be Ignored by America - Truman Calls for Conservation, Also Invites Latin American Countries to Participate in European Aid Efforts - No Special Session of Congress is Planned</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 25th - President Truman today continued to urge the American people to do their utmost to avoid wasting food, in order to relieve Europe's food shortage this winter. He is seeking to provide Europe with transitional assistance, without planning to convene a special session of Congress. Convening a special session of Congress is not a simple matter, and Europe's need for assistance is truly urgent. Truman will meet with congressional leaders next Monday, and the issue of providing rapid aid to Europe will be the main topic of discussion. Today, Truman ordered the establishment of a Citizen's Food Committee, whose task is to conserve and preserve food, so that America can have the ability to assist Europe, as America cannot stand by and watch Europe freeze and starve. Luckman, General Manager of Lever Brothers Company, has been appointed Chairman of the Citizen's Food Committee. Truman's request for the American people to conserve food does not mean asking the American people to reduce their food intake. The main point is to reduce waste. It should be noted that Americans waste as much as 70 million tons of wheat each year by discarding leftover bread. Some asked whether America would restore price controls, and Truman replied that this depends on the attitude of Congress. Others asked whether America would restore the rationing system, and the President said that a decision would be made after a detailed investigation of the actual situation. Truman hopes that Latin American countries will also bear part of the costs of the Marshall Plan, and the US government will seek consultations with Latin American countries. In short, all countries with surplus food should generously help others in need.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 24th] Truman convened a special cabinet meeting today to review the food situation. The President also held talks with Agriculture Secretary Anderson, discussing the international food situation and domestic agricultural issues. Today, Republican Policy Committee Chairman Taft said in Seattle that congressional leaders have been recalled to the White House and are scheduled to discuss the food issue with Truman on the 29th. It is said that his office has intercepted the notice, but he will not be able to complete his four-part trip until October 2nd, so he will not be able to attend. Vandenberg will represent the Senate Republicans at the meeting.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Washington, 24th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett said on the 24th that the British government has [fully mobilized] all appropriate facilities to begin work on the Marshall Plan report submitted by the Paris Conference. He said that several experts drafting plans for European needs have been invited to Washington in October to meet and provide more information on the Paris report. He said that Marshall is now submitting this report to President Truman.</p>
<h3>After the Report from Sixteen Countries Arrives in Washington, The First Reaction from Congress - Speaker of the House Argues for Serious Consideration</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 25th] Speaker of the House Martin said last night at the Milwaukee Auditorium to Wisconsin Republicans that Congress will insist that any US economic aid should be based on the receiving country's sincere expression. Those who wish to receive US aid must prove that they have gradually relied on their own intelligence, resources, and production. Relying solely on US dollars is not enough to accomplish this task. Past US aid has cost huge sums of money, but has still failed to achieve European recovery and self-sufficiency. Future aid to foreign countries should be properly allocated and supervised. In addition, the major problems facing the future Congress include taxation, prices, and housing.</p>
<h3>British Trades Union Congress Supports Export Plan</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] The British Trades Union Congress, representing seven million workers, after a meeting of the Council today lasting three and a half hours, issued a declaration calling on workers across the country to devote their full efforts to production, in order to achieve the government's set export targets. The Council reviewed the export plan of Commerce Secretary Cripps, and decided to send notices to all national unions to engage in full cooperation to complete the government's targets.</p>
<h3>Nazi-Looted Gold to Be Initially Distributed</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] US Acting Secretary of State Lovett announced today that the US-UK-France Gold Commission has agreed to make an initial distribution of gold previously looted by Germany and now recovered by the Allied forces, to cope with the European economic crisis. This batch of gold totals $260 million. In addition, the Allied forces recovered another batch of gold worth $70 million in countries formerly ruled by Germany, but the distribution of this gold is still awaiting final decision. Lovett said when announcing the Commission's agreement that, due to the need to retain reserves to meet unforeseen needs, only half of the total amount of $330 million can be distributed immediately. Lovett continued that, although the distribution of this huge sum of gold cannot eliminate the need for Western European countries to obtain excessively emergency aid from the United States, the financial situation of France and other countries will be greatly improved as a result.</p>
<h3>UN General Assembly Political Committee Sits Together - Pakistan and Yemen Join</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 24th] The UN General Assembly Political Committee today unanimously passed a resolution by a vote of 35 to 0 to recommend to the General Assembly that the Dominion of Pakistan and the Kingdom of Yemen be admitted as members of the United Nations. At the beginning of the meeting, Bolivian representative Reyes was elected as Vice-Chairman of the Political Committee, and Danish representative Federspiel was elected as Secretary. The first item on the agenda passed by the Political Committee was the Balkans issue, followed by the US proposal to establish a 55-nation Peace and Security Committee, the Soviet proposal to punish war criminals, the Korean independence case, the amendment of the Charter, the South African Indian treatment case, and the veto issue.</p>
<h3>France Opposes Operation of Ruhr Coal Mines by Germans</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 24th] Authoritative sources report that French Ambassador to Britain Massigli submitted a letter to the British Foreign Secretary today, stating France's views on the Anglo-American temporary agreement on Ruhr coal mines. The agreement stipulates the establishment of an Anglo-American Ruhr Coal Mines Bureau to implement supervision, while also entrusting the operation of Ruhr coal mines to Germans. It is understood that France's recent opinion letter has not withdrawn its opposition to entrusting the operation of Ruhr coal mines to Germans. In addition to raising criticisms, France also expressed concerns about the future of these mines, which have French commercial interests, and reserved its position on the transfer of operation to Germans. The Dutch government's opinion letter on this agreement is still being studied by the British Foreign Office.</p>
<h3>US Treasury Secretary Arrives in Germany</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] US Treasury Secretary Snyder arrived in Berlin by plane from Paris this afternoon. US military commander General Clay and his economic advisor Bennett personally welcomed him at the airport. Snyder told reporters that he came at Clay's invitation and will meet with those responsible for US military zone control. He will return to Paris in two days.</p>
<h3>US Plans to Submit Detailed Rules Proposal for Establishment of 55-Nation Standing Committee to UN General Assembly Political Committee for Discussion</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 25th] It is reported that Secretary of State Marshall's proposal to establish a 55-nation Peace and Security Committee has been drafted into detailed rules. It will be submitted to each delegation of the UN General Assembly on Thursday for study. This plan will be presented to the UN General Assembly Political Committee for discussion by US representative Dulles, an expert on Republican foreign policy issues.</p>
<p>It is heard that this detailed rules proposal is sufficient to address various criticisms inside and outside the UN General Assembly regarding Marshall's proposal. The matters that the Peace and Security Committee can discuss have been carefully restricted, in order to avoid, as the French representative said, that this committee will induce countries to submit all new and old disputes to the committee without attempting to resolve them outside the committee first. Some countries with colonies are also concerned that the committee will usurp the powers of the Trusteeship Council and induce many independence movements. The US detailed rules proposal has taken into account the above points, so it will make the committee a true peacekeeping organization, rather than a venue for countries to engage in propaganda. The functions of this new committee are expected to be: 1. Reviewing situations and disputes that hinder friendly relations between countries; 2. Proposing suggestions for peaceful resolution of disputes; 3. Recommending actions to the Security Council.</p>
<h3>US Will Propose New Proposal on Balkans Issue</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 25th] It is known today that the US delegation has drafted a new proposal on the Balkans issue, requesting UN agencies to immediately establish a "large-scale" group to regularly monitor the borders of Greece with Southern Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania, in order to reduce conflicts in the region, protect Greece from communist intrusion, and consolidate Truman Doctrine's international position. The case will be discussed by the 55-nation Political Committee. Mrs. Roosevelt has been ordered to assist the US representative to counter future strong opposition from the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Australian Foreign Minister Elected Chairman of Palestine Special Committee</h3>
<p>[Report from this Newspaper] The United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, broadcasting from San Francisco on the 25th, elected Australian Foreign Minister Evatt to serve as Chairman of the Committee today. It is scheduled to discuss the investigation committee's report tomorrow, with the British representative making a statement.</p>
<p>[United Press International, Lake Success, 25th] Britain plans to state to the Palestine Committee that if UN agencies can find a solution to the Palestine problem, Britain is prepared to provide appropriate support.</p>
<h3>United Nations Budget Reduced to $34 Million</h3>
<p>[United Nations Office in Shanghai, Lake Success, 24th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie will submit a budget of $34.5 million for 1948 to the Fifth (Administrative and Budgetary) Committee of the General Assembly today, a reduction of $5 million from the amount estimated by the Advisory Committee this summer.</p>
<h3>Italian Left-Wing Parties Launch Anti-Government Movement - Labor Disputes Continue to Expand</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Rome, 24th] Italian left-wing parties on the 24th again called for the formation of a new Italian government that includes the Communist Party, and suggested that the parliament's scheduled debate and vote of confidence on Christian Democratic Prime Minister Gasperi's cabinet be postponed again. As the Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party continue to confer, in order to form a united anti-government group, they are making continuous efforts to force a showdown in parliament, and labor disputes continue to expand.</p>
<p>The Communist Party said that the parliamentary debate may not begin before next Tuesday. Although the government suffered a defeat on the 23rd evening regarding the amendment of the law, it seems difficult for the extreme left to create a united party against Gasperi and gain support. The Republican Party, which initially claimed to be willing to join hands with the Communist Party, said that they will act alone when casting their vote of confidence. The right-wing Socialist Party, led by Saragat, will also not participate, leaving the Communist Party supported only by the left-wing Socialist Party led by Lunni and a small number of Action Party members.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Rome, 24th] 100,000 farmers in central Italy began a strike yesterday, and have not yet returned to work today. At the same time, farmers and veterans who have no work continue to occupy privately owned uncultivated land, with thousands of acres of land occupied nationwide.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Submits National Coal Mine Control Bill to Parliament</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 25th] The Japanese government submitted a bill to parliament on the 25th to nationalize and control all coal mines in the country. The bill has been discussed by the cabinet for three months and was finally approved recently. Observers believe that the bill will inevitably cause fierce debate in both houses of parliament. Some observers believe that the bill will ultimately be shelved, as even the miners themselves will rise up in opposition.</p>
<h3>We Nominate Stucki as Governor-General of Trust Territory</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 24th] The Security Council convened a closed-door meeting tonight to discuss the selection of the Governor-General of the Trust Territory. No agreement was reached.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency Special Dispatch, Lake Success, New York, 24th] Our representative submitted a new candidate for Governor-General of the Trust Territory to the Security Council today, and the hope that the Security Council will reach an agreement on the Governor-General of the Trust Territory is now brighter. According to sources, the candidate proposed by our country is Dr. Stucki, former Swiss Ambassador to France.</p>
<h3>Judges of the Far East Military Tribunal Debate - Chief Prosecutor Exonerates the Emperor - Emphasizes that the Emperor Did Not Launch the War</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Tokyo, 25th] The Far East Military Tribunal continued to hear Japanese war criminals today. Chief Prosecutor Keenan issued a statement exonerating Emperor Hirohito from any suspicion of war crimes. Previously, war criminal Okada was cross-examined in court. Keenan asked: "Is it true that the Emperor did not want to launch a war against the United States on the eve of the Pearl Harbor incident and wanted to avoid it?" Okada replied: "Indeed. The Emperor was not concerned about the outcome of the war. He really hated war."</p>
<p>Judge Webb interrupted and said: "I think this matter is irrelevant to the case." Keenan disagreed, saying: "The defendants usurped Japanese power and deceived the people, believing that the edict issued a few hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor was due to the Emperor's approval of the war. This is obviously relevant." Webb replied: "This kind of statement is the first time we have seen it after many days of trial and violates the prosecutor's evidence." Keenan, his face flushed, apparently as angry as Webb, spoke again: "As Chief Prosecutor, I ask the court to note that the defendants are all present. We believe that these people are responsible for this war. If there are other responsible parties, they must also be included among the defendants."</p>
<h3>US Aid Restores South Korean Industry</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 25th] The South Korean Ministry of Commerce announced that US government materials have arrived in Busan, including 1,600 tons of light metal and raw materials such as turbines, copper, and lead, which will be distributed to the industrial sector to repair industrial equipment destroyed by the Japanese and build Korean-owned industries.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops May Withdraw Due to Widespread Agents in Korea</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Manila, 25th] Sources close to the US military government in South Korea said today that the Soviet Union will likely suddenly withdraw its troops stationed in North Korea and then demand that the United States withdraw its troops stationed in the South as well. As a result, the communists left behind will intensify their activities, and Soviet civilian personnel will work together with Korean leftists to transform all of Korea into a Soviet sphere of influence.</p>
<h3>Cochinchina Accepts Bao Dai's Mediation Proposal</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 24th] Agence France-Presse reported from Saigon that representatives of various political parties in Cochinchina unanimously agreed today to accept the mediation proposal of Annamite Emperor Bao Dai for the dispute between France and Vietnam. This decision was made at a joint meeting of various parties convened by Cochinchina President Le Van Hoach.</p>

<h3>India and the Netherlands to Resume Negotiations - Indonesian Prime Minister to Personally Lead Delegation - Batavia Consular Corps Flies to Yogyakarta Today</h3>
<p>[United Press International, Batavia, 25th] The Indonesian News Agency reported that the Indonesian cabinet established a delegation on the 24th to prepare to represent Indonesia in future negotiations with the Netherlands before the United Nations Tripartite Committee. The delegation will be led by Prime Minister Sjahrir, and Minister Sastromidjojo will serve as deputy head of the delegation.</p>
<p>According to a government spokesperson, it has not yet been decided whether the negotiations will take place in Singapore. Van Mook of the Netherlands said after returning here on the 23rd: "I personally believe that it is most ideal to appoint the United States as a member of the Tripartite Committee to mediate the dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia." Van Mook also knows nothing about when the Tripartite Committee will properly begin its work. He said that if negotiations are to be reopened, the will of the current Republican authorities must change.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Batavia, 24th] The Consular Corps of six countries representing the Security Council's investigation of the India-Netherlands ceasefire order - China, Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, and Australia - decided to fly to Yogyakarta on Friday aboard a British-Australian Air Force transport plane for a one-day stay to listen to the opinions of the Indonesian government.</p>
<h3>Atomic Bomb's Effect Helps Vegetable Growth</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tokyo, 25th] Agricultural experts in Nagasaki reported that the radiation effect of the atomic bomb helps the growth of vegetables. After the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, the output of most summer vegetables increased by an average of 50% compared to the previous average, and the highest even increased by 200%. Wheat and millet increased threefold. However, some say that it is caused by the fertilizer effect of decaying matter after the bombing.</p>
<h3>Australian Parliament Debates Policy Towards Indonesia</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Canberra, 24th] During a debate on foreign policy in the Australian House of Representatives, opposition leader Menzies criticized the government's submission of the Indonesian issue to the Security Council, stating that this was an internal matter. He argued that if such a precedent were set, other countries might one day raise questions about Australia's White Australia policy and its treatment of indigenous people in New Guinea, leaving Australia without a defense. Australian Prime Minister Chifley announced the appointment of Federal Arbitration Court Judge Kirby as Australia's representative on the two-nation committee established by the Security Council to mediate the dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia.</p>

<h3>Heated Debate at the Municipal Council Session: Labor Service Corps Proposal Postponed, Support for Borrowing US Deposits Approved</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] The first half of the fourth session of the Municipal Council, involving inquiries to various bureaus, has concluded. Yesterday afternoon, the fourth session commenced, during which six proposals submitted by the Speaker were discussed, along with the adoption of three recommendations regarding the issuance of permits for goods imported with self-provided foreign exchange, and two recommendations regarding the request for the return of occupied properties. Yesterday, when the session discussed the proposal submitted by the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Public Works to organize a National Obligatory Labor Service Corps, it sparked a heated debate among the councilors, with divided opinions on whether to implement or postpone it. According to Councilor Tao Baichuan, the draft constitution included a clause stating that "citizens have the obligation to perform public service," but this was opposed by many, who argued that since citizens already have the obligation to perform military service, it was inappropriate to impose another obligation for public service. Furthermore, the provision for public service was issued during wartime, and has since been removed. Therefore, he advocated for the temporary postponement of the proposal. Councilor Qu Yue vehemently opposed this, insisting on its adoption. He argued that dredging river channels in the suburbs was underway, and without a labor service corps, the project would be abandoned halfway, greatly affecting the people in the suburbs. Ultimately, a vote was held, resulting in 68 votes in favor of postponement and 31 votes against.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Council resolved to postpone the proposal from the Municipal Government for reviewing the "Implementation Measures for Relocating Tricycles to the Suburbs in Response to the Request from Unemployed Workers from Northern Jiangsu to Issue Tricycle Licenses in the Suburbs." However, it was decided that the third session's resolution to issue 1,170 tricycle licenses to refugees from Northern Jiangsu, limited to operating in the suburbs, would still be implemented.</p>
<p>Regarding the amendment made by the third session to the Military Service Law's exemption clause, which originally stated "those responsible for the livelihood of one or more direct relatives," and was amended to "those responsible for the livelihood of one or more family members," the Municipal Government believed the amended scope was too broad and requested reconsideration to retain the original clause. Yesterday, the Council session, after discussing the matter, adopted Tao Baichuan's suggestion to request clarification from the central government regarding the term "sole responsibility for family livelihood." Until clarification is received, the amended clause from the Council will be followed.</p>
<p>The session unanimously approved the proposal from the Provisional Council of Liaoning Province to "borrow deposits from Chinese citizens in the United States to rescue the economic crisis and suppress rebellion and save the nation," as well as three points regarding opinions submitted by the Tianjin District Industrial Association and other organizations to the government, advocating for the opening of trade with Japan.</p>
<h3>Recommendations Regarding Goods Imported with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Regarding the petition from export trade associations for the issuance of permits for goods imported with self-provided foreign exchange, Councilor Bao Wenxin reported on the process of receiving the petition. The session approved the following three recommendations:</p>
<p>For production equipment, industrial raw materials, and other essential goods for people's livelihoods that have already completed registration procedures and comply with trade regulations, it is requested that they be released as soon as possible to facilitate production and construction.</p>
<p>Regarding the registration deadline, the Import Control Commission originally stipulated that goods must arrive in Shanghai and be shipped by August 16th, but the announcement was only published on August 21st, leaving insufficient time. Considering the circumstances, it is requested that registration be permitted retroactively for all goods shipped before the end of September.</p>
<p>As for government procurement, it is absolutely unfeasible. It is requested that the government weigh the advantages and disadvantages and give it serious consideration.</p>

<h3>Order to Refund Overcharged Tuition Fees: Most of the 70,000 Children Out of School Due to Parental Refusal</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Acting Director of the Bureau of Education Li Ximou and Director of the Bureau of Health Zhang Wei yesterday organized responses at the session to inquiries raised by councilors from the previous day regarding the two bureaus.</p>
<p>According to Director Li's response: Regarding Councilor Pang Jingzhou's accusation that private schools were inventing pretexts to solicit parents' opinions on budget statements, a thorough investigation will be conducted to stop this practice. The salaries of new teachers added to municipal schools in August have been approved by the Municipal Government and will be paid in September. The overcharge of tuition fees by municipal middle schools in the suburbs is a fact. The principals of Yangjing, Yangsi, and two other schools have been summoned for discussions, and they have been ordered to refund the overcharged fees separately. Half of the academic advancement fees will be refunded by middle schools, and elementary schools that have not yet refunded them will be ordered to do so. Those who cannot afford to pay the academic advancement fees are not required to pay, and repeated orders have been issued prohibiting forced collection. According to statistics on school-age children, there are approximately 420,000 to 430,000, with over 360,000 enrolled and about 70,000 out of school. According to the Bureau's investigation, many children are out of school because their parents refuse to allow them to attend, due to illness, disability, or work. The Bureau operates some night schools and community schools, but due to financial difficulties, they can only utilize the spare time and facilities of other schools to provide education, allowing workers to study while working. The biggest obstacle to the widespread establishment of national schools is the lack of school buildings.</p>
<h3>Use of Teacher Appreciation Donations</h3>
<p>The nature of normal schools is to train teachers for junior high schools and national schools. Regarding the destruction of Wuben Girls' Middle School buildings by the Municipal Normal School, an investigation was conducted in person, and it was found that the Normal School did not damage the water and electricity, but only took away blackboards and cupboards, which will be ordered to be returned. Regarding the inflated enrollment figures at the Normal School, an investigation revealed that it was due to a large number of students registering at the beginning of the semester, with some students later dropping out or not attending classes. Last year's teacher appreciation donations of 100 million yuan will be used for secondary education and social welfare projects.</p>
<h3>Negotiations to Cancel Lease for Establishing School in Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Director Zhang of the Bureau of Health replied to inquiries, stating: Regarding the Municipal Sixth Hospital on Daxi Road, the second and third floors were used as staff dormitories due to a shortage of housing, resulting in some non-bureau employees residing there. The third floor has now been completely vacated, and there are still five families on the second floor, who must move out by the end of the month, otherwise the police station will be notified to enforce the eviction. Regarding the establishment of general stores and schools in the vegetable market, the truth is that the third floor of the Triangle Land Vegetable Market was originally vacant. In May of last year, Sanfu Company negotiated with the Bureau of Finance, and after approval by the Finance Committee, leased the floor to open a hygienic cafeteria. Later, upon hearing that there were schools being run there, the Bureau requested the Bureau of Education to investigate whether they were registered, and negotiated with the original tenant company to cancel the lease. A small number of employees reside in the vegetable market management office, and will be ordered to move out as soon as the Bureau has dormitories available. The corpses at the Tongren Fuyuan Hall need to be buried urgently and are temporarily piled up in the open space by the roadside, and burial has been ordered. The pollution of the Suzhou Creek is a dredging issue, and discussions have been held with the Bureau of Public Works.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit Involving Real and Fake Wives of Classmate: Accusation of Impersonating Diplomatic Envoy's Family Member to Illegally Obtain Travel Expenses in US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Report from Our Newspaper] Gao Qinqiu, a female clerk in the Statistics Office of the Police Department, was sued yesterday by a young woman, Li Rongni, in the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing Gao of impersonating a family member of a diplomatic envoy stationed abroad to illegally obtain over 1,000 US dollars in travel expenses. Xie Jiashu, a graduate of the Diplomacy Department of the Central Political School who later worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was introduced to Li Rongni (Yunyi), a student at the Fudan University Statistics Training Program, in 1945 by a friend. They became involved without going through engagement procedures and had a daughter. Later, Xie became romantically involved with Gao Qinqiu (also a student at the Fudan Training Program), a clerk in the Statistics Office of the same department, and gradually became indifferent to Li. In March of last year, Xie was assigned to the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco, USA. Before leaving the country, he sent a letter to Li Rongni, guaranteeing that he would never get engaged or married to anyone else. However, after going abroad, he disappeared without a trace. Although Li remained infatuated and often sent letters asking about him, Xie ignored them all. Later, due to financial difficulties in Shanghai, Li received 300,000 to 400,000 yuan per month from He Xingren, a section chief in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, who was a classmate of Xie's. Li reported this situation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and requested assistance, and the Ministry promised to investigate thoroughly. Gao Qinqiu, Xie's later lover, left the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and came to Shanghai to work as a clerk in the Statistics Office of the Police Department. Recently, she forged a marriage certificate with Xie and applied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to illegally obtain over 1,000 US dollars in travel expenses as a family member of a diplomatic envoy stationed abroad, intending to go abroad to San Francisco to meet Xie. Upon hearing this, Li Rongni became extremely anxious. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she also filed a lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, claiming that Gao is a married woman, her husband is Xu Liangyi, director of the Nanshi branch of the Shanghai Municipal Bank, and they have not divorced. Her marriage certificate is purely forged. She requested a thorough investigation of the illegal obtaining of over 1,000 US dollars in travel expenses as a family member of a diplomatic envoy stationed abroad. After receiving the above complaint, the District Prosecutor's Office will schedule a hearing to question both Li and Gao.</p>

<h3>Those Coerced into Wrongdoing Should Awaken Early and Register: Social Affairs Bureau Orders All Guilds to Diligently Promote</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency] The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the quality of workers in the city is uneven. Recently, the city cracked down on a case involving treacherous bandits, including Wu Kewen, a worker at the Shanghai Electric Power Company. In other places, it is difficult to guarantee that there are no bandits lurking among them, engaging in agitation. At this time, the government issued measures for the disposal of the Communist Party in the rear, and the Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters stipulated that from September 25th to September 28th, 2023, the deadline for registration, the various labor unions have been ordered to take this opportunity to be lenient and allow self-renewal. Those who have been coerced into wrongdoing or have blindly followed others should awaken early and promptly comply with the deadline, in accordance with the prescribed procedures, to apply for registration and extricate themselves. If they remain unrepentant and fail to apply for registration before the deadline, they will have only themselves to blame if they are arrested by the military and police agencies.

<h3>Defected Communist Soldiers Arrive in Shanghai, Discuss "Eighth Route Army" Secrets, Extremely Poor Supplies, Harassing Civilians Everywhere, Strict Surveillance of Intellectuals</h3>
<p>[Our Report] 3,161 officers and soldiers of a certain infantry regiment directly under the Ministry of National Defense arrived in Shanghai aboard the China Merchants Bureau's Hai Zhou Wheel, docking at the Qiujiang Wharf. Yesterday morning, our reporter visited and learned from Regiment Commander Shen Dedi that most of the comrades in this regiment had defected from the Communist army, with 60% voluntarily surrendering, 30% being prisoners of war, and many others being former National Army soldiers who had been captured by the Communists and returned. He also said, "The quality of the Communist soldiers who surrendered is very good, with a very high level of education, including high school and university students, and a literacy rate of 95%. Most are from Shandong, Shanxi, and the Northeast." The reporter interviewed two "Old Eighth Route Army" soldiers, one named Zhang Yongde from Beijing and the other named Gao Shangjun from Liaodong. According to them, joining the "Eighth Route Army" was a baffling matter, as they only knew it as a "Security Force" when they joined. Soldiers in the "Eighth Route Army" are called "Warriors," and the "Warriors" have extremely poor supplies, eating and wearing the people's belongings everywhere. Currently, when the people of the Northeast see the "Eighth Route Army" coming, they hide all the food and clothing they can. Cadres at the company level and above receive better treatment, with a salary of 50 yuan per month regardless of rank), paid in "Liaodong Military Region Military Vouchers," with 50 yuan equivalent to 100 yuan of Northeast circulating currency, but the people regard it as waste paper and cannot circulate it at all. Life in the army is quite free, with three Communist Party members in each platoon. There are many Korean Communists, and many "Big Noses" (referring to Russians). Currently, the Communist Party does not want intellectuals to join the party and monitors intellectuals more closely. In the Battle of Siping, the Communist bandits used non-Party members as the vanguard, giving each person four hand grenades to charge, while Communist Party members with heavy weapons stayed behind, so non-Party members suffered heavy casualties.</p>

The people on the road thought they were executing Japanese war criminals, but later they realized that these two convicted officials were the once-prominent takeover officials who had been detained and interrogated for years due to "takeover" and corruption, and were recently sentenced to death and executed on the spot by the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters: one was Mo Yushuo, the former Lieutenant General Special Commissioner of the Guangzhou District Special Commissioner Office of the Ministry of Military Administration, and the other was Li Jiewen, the Major General Commander of the Guangdong Provincial Sand Protection Corps.</p>
<p>Swatting Flies is Common, But Catching Tigers is Rare</p>
<p>As soon as this news spread, people were very happy, because swatting flies is common, but catching tigers is rare. At least in Guangzhou, executing corrupt high-ranking officials with the rank of Lieutenant General and Major General is a first.</p>
<p>Mo Yushuo was from Yangjiang, Guangdong, and was 44 years old. Li Jiewen was from Dongguan, Guangdong, and was 43 years old. Both were early graduates of Whampoa Military Academy. Mo once served as an army commander, and Li once served as the commander of the Guangzhou Social Training Corps and the chief officer of the training camp for students above the secondary level, but they both failed the country's cultivation. Despite holding high positions, they were still corrupt and violated the law, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>Clearing Up the Muddled Account of the Seized Goods</p>
<p>When Mo was first sent back to Guangzhou, he was considered one of the most powerful takeover officials. Li Jiewen served as a Major General Director in his office. At that time, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Office had not yet been established, so the military special office not only took over military supplies, but also all kinds of Western-style houses, cars, etc., and many things were not transferred with a record. At that time, the general public had long complained about the office's takeover malpractices. In September of last year, the Guangdong-Guangxi District Takeover Investigation Team came to Guangdong, and this muddled account of the takeover was cleared up, and Mo and Li were taken into custody and sent to the central government for interrogation. Mo was sent back to the city on September 23rd, and Li was escorted back to Guangzhou on October 26th.</p>
<p>Higher Military Law Court Investigation Reveals Military Equipment Being Embezzled</p>
<p>"The charges for which they were sentenced to death this time are: jointly embezzling the seized military firearms and transporting them to Huangge, Hengdang, and Sanjiao townships in Zhongshan County for concealment, including more than 100 light and heavy machine guns, 16 mortars, 2,000 rifles, and another 700 boxes of spare parts and ammunition. In addition, Mo colluded with his staff to replace more than 200 inner tubes of the seized vehicles with waste products to profit." This case was investigated by Peng Weiren, the Lieutenant General Director sent by the Ministry of National Defense, who organized the Higher Military Law Court to conduct the trial. The facts were confirmed, and the sentence was passed according to law.</p>
<p>Mo Yushuo Wrote a Will Complaining About Family Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>When the judge asked Mo Yushuo and Li Jiewen in the military court if they had any last words, Li said angrily, "No, no, nothing." Mo picked up a pen and wrote a will to his wife, which read: "Dear Sister Zhen: Regarding the outcome of this trial, soldiers obey orders, and there is nothing to say. I ask my sister to take care of the family affairs. I think you will handle it well, so I have no worries. If there are financial difficulties in the future, please ask friends for help. I think Yu Chen and Brother Xinzhong, Military Commander Hu Boyu, and Commander-in-Chief Huo Songshan, etc., can help. Yushuo, 9/16." After the will was written, the two were escorted to the Liuhua Bridge execution ground. According to custom, they were offered wine and meat before the execution, but both declined. At 5:30, four gunshots were heard in quick succession, and these two "takeover" officials ended their lives under the judgment of national law, leaving a lesson for those who are corrupt!

<h3>Mo and Li Were Shocked and Terrified When They Heard the Verdict. Mo Yushuo Asked, "Who Approved This?" and Scolded Li Jiewen, "What's All the Noise?"</h3>
<p>[Our Report from Guangzhou via airmail] During the trial of Mo Yushuo and Li Jiewen's corruption case, a rumor circulated that the initial verdict of the court-martial was only a ten-year prison sentence, but when the verdict was submitted to Chairman Chiang, he immediately changed it to a death sentence. If this rumor is true, we can see Chairman Chiang's determination to severely punish corruption.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's order was issued on September 12th, and brought by a commissioner on a special plane on the afternoon of the 15th. On the afternoon of the 16th, at 5 PM, Zheng Zongyuan, the deputy director of the military law office, presided over the trial and read out Chairman Chiang's order. Mo and Li were shocked and terrified. Li even argued vehemently and asked, "Who approved this?" Mo pretended to be calm and turned to scold Li, "Soldiers only obey orders, what's all the noise?" Li then became silent and stopped talking.</p>

<h3>Four Major Crises in Fujian Education, Talked About by Liang Longguang, Director of the Fujian Education Department</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 24th] According to Liang Longguang, the new Director of the Fujian Education Department, the current education in Fujian contains four major crises: 　lack of funds, 　teacher imbalance, 　poor academic atmosphere, and 　low student quality. He said, "This year's education funding in Fujian Province is only 2.2 billion yuan, of which the cost of meals for publicly funded students accounts for 1.5 billion yuan, leaving only 700 million yuan for school equipment and basic school treatment needs, which is clearly insufficient. In terms of teachers, talents are concentrated in cities, forming a surplus of talents in cities, resulting in unemployment, while inland areas feel a lack of them. General schools, due to insufficient funds, simple equipment, and low teacher quality, have no way to improve the academic atmosphere. The level of students is also not easy to improve. There are currently more than one million children out of school and more than four million adults out of school in the province. The funding for national education is particularly scarce, with the highest counties accounting for only 5% of total expenditures and the lowest accounting for only 1.5%. Secondary education currently has 20 provincial middle schools, 10 vocational schools, 13 normal schools, and 50 county middle schools. The middle schools in remote counties are mostly of too low a standard and cannot find teachers for English, mathematics, and physics. I especially call on private educators to run more primary schools to strengthen the implementation of national education."</p>

It was chaired by Chen Qitian, Minister of Economic Affairs. Mr. Chen stated in his address: "In the current environment of our country, the textile industry is the most promising industry for development. Therefore, industrial construction must take the development of the textile industry as its central policy. To seek the development of the textile industry, the following points should be noted in policy: Prevention of the development of the Japanese textile industry; State-run and private-run factories should cooperate rather than compete; The development of the textile industry should closely cooperate with agriculture, animal husbandry, sericulture, and trade departments; The basis of textile construction is to improve textile technology; The Textile Adjustment Committee will actively promote guidance work based on the recently adopted plan by the Executive Yuan to develop the textile industry and adjust the supply and demand of yarn and cloth; Pay attention to the export of textile finished products, etc."</p>
<p>Following this, a representative of the National Economic Council, concurrently Chairman Qiang, delivered a training speech, and guests Du Yuesheng, Shu Yunzhang, Chu Fucheng, Shi Fengxiang, and others successively delivered speeches. The meeting adjourned around 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>The conference continued in the afternoon at 3:00 p.m., still chaired by Chen Qitian. Secretary-General Liu Wenteng reported: 270 notification letters were issued, 215 representatives registered, and 170 were in attendance. Three congratulatory telegrams were received from the Shanghai Municipality.

<h3>Affected by Tight Credit, Hua Shares Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Although Hua shares rose yesterday, they were very uncertain. The swap premium rose due to tight credit. Although buying interest was strong, it was very volatile. Although Yongsha created a high price, it could not last. In the afternoon, credit became even tighter, and state bank exchangers entered heavily. A large number of bulls emerged, and market prices gradually felt unsustainable in the uncertainty.</p>
<p>Morning Opening</p>
<p>Prices were high at the opening, but after the opening, the transaction became clear and slightly fatigued. There were many entries from all sides, and from the immediate delivery price of 264 yuan and the deferred delivery price of 271 yuan, the price rose to 268 yuan and 279 yuan, and interest rates rose. The bulls were not without concerns. After the sale, they became timid again. The outside interest rate opened high to 25 cents and 30 cents. After 10:30 a.m., it was forced down to the immediate delivery price of 259 yuan and the deferred delivery low price of 271 yuan. After the interest rate was agreed, the buying momentum immediately revived. Now Yongsha rose to an immediate delivery price of 274 yuan and a deferred delivery price of 285 yuan. Taking advantage of the high price, there was a settlement, and spot Yongsha was sold, once falling to 278 yuan. The bulls added more chips at will, and near noon, they pulled the deferred Yongsha up to 284 yuan again. Overnight, there was a lot of floating, and due to time constraints, there was a lot of supply. The midday closing price for immediate delivery was 265 yuan, and the deferred delivery price was 280 yuan. The difference between spot and deferred was as much as 15 yuan. Therefore, after the midday closing, the deferred Yongsha was called down to around 275 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing price of immediate delivery shares, Yongsha, Meyer, China France, Zhabei, Zhongxing, New Asia, Shangping, Huafeng, Qinxing, Xinhua, Rongfeng, China Textile, China Silk, Commercial Press, Matches, and Lian rose slightly. Huaxin fell by half a percent, Hengfeng fell slightly, Jinglun Cement rose by half a percent, and underwear rose by one percent. Deferred delivery shares Huafeng rose by one percent, Xinhe Meyer rose by half a percent, and Yongsha rose slightly.</p>
<p>Afternoon</p>
<p>I heard that the black market price was also smart. The market saw show and many consecutive investments were made to exit. Those who entered also desperately sold, and the deferred Yongsha gradually decreased to 269 yuan. It was reported that a large number of officials came to Shanghai to check accounts, and there were new measures for self-provided foreign exchange. The selling intention was already in place. The national bank also entered 9.29 billion, forcing the immediate delivery price down to 257 yuan and the deferred delivery price to 266 yuan. Finally, it hovered around 260 yuan and 270 yuan. The asking price after closing was uncertain. As a result, compared with the morning closing price of immediate delivery shares, Yongsha, Xinhe, Meyer, Huafeng, China France, Xinhua, Zhabei, Rongfeng, China Silk, Jinglun, and Lian fell slightly, Qinxing, Matches, and Hengfeng were flat, China Textile fell by half a percent, towel and Huaxin rose slightly. Deferred delivery shares Yongsha, Xinhe, Meyer, and Huafeng all reported small declines. Outside the market, old shares Yuyu and Hengfeng were stable.</p>
<p>The capital increase of Tongyi Yarn Factory has been completed and trading is scheduled to resume today. The trading unit is set at 50,000 shares.</p>
<p>Current Situation</p>
<p>Profiteering. Yesterday, the interest rate was high, about 13 to 20 cents, because the bank's funding was limited and the bulls were crowded. The premium for Yongsha was from 8.5 yuan to 12 yuan, and ended at 11 yuan. Xinhe was from 5 yuan to 6.5 yuan, and Meyer was from 18 yuan to 20 yuan. Many bulls had pre-booked with the bank, so trading in the market was not brisk. Numbers 223, 24, 116 posted the most.</p>
<h3>Reduction of Security Deposit is All Rumor</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] According to the Ministry of Finance: Recently, there has been talk in the Shanghai stock market that the security deposit has been changed to 30%.

<h3>Unified Bonds Rise, Foreign Shares Firm</h3>
<p>For public bonds, Unified Unit C was still flat yesterday, and the remaining bonds trended upward. Rooms 503 and 538 sold, and Rooms 552, 614 and 555 all entered. The transaction volume increased to 7 million. Unified Unit C opened at 12,600 yuan in the morning and rose from 12,400 yuan to 13,400 yuan before turning to consolidation. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Units A and B rose by 700 yuan, Unified Unit C rose by 400 yuan, and Unified Unit D also rose by a good 600 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign shares were still firm yesterday and were even smarter in the afternoon, because the Hong Kong-Shanghai Telegram narrowed to within 10 yuan, and buyers were eager. Yisha opened at 112,000 yuan in the morning and rose to 26,000 yuan at the end of the afternoon. Although Jewish merchant securities firms supplied, Guangbang and foreign firms all entered. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yisha and Kenzhi each rose by about 10%, and Yisha Beer, Steel, and Shipping each rose by about 5%. The remaining shares rose slightly.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange and Trade Measures Remain Unchanged; Deputy Governor of the National Bank Responsible for Statement</h3>
<p>[Our Dispatch] Deputy Governor Liu of the Central Bank issued the following statement yesterday:</p>
<p>Recent reports in various newspapers about foreign exchange and trade measures are mostly inconsistent with the facts. According to the business report from the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee yesterday to September 17, foreign exchange income reached approximately US$20 million in the first month after the committee was established, which is a very good situation. Although a part of it was converted from export goods accumulated before the announcement of the new foreign exchange measures, the timing is right for the peak export season, and the export prospects are quite optimistic.</p>
<p>As for the foreign exchange required for imports, whether official or market price, the government will continue to provide it fully as usual. Since the implementation of the import quota system, it has gradually entered a normal state, and there is no reason to change the measures.</p>
<p>Regarding the price of gold, the Central Bank converts it according to the market price of US$40 per tael, as approved by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. There is also no change in this measure. Various rumors outside are unfounded.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Firm</h3>
<p>In yesterday's yarn market, the appetite of all parties at the initial opening was still healthy, and the sentiment was quite good. The market rose again. However, as credit tightened, the market fell back. Near the close, due to the small number of factory openings, prices returned to firm. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn created a new high of 27.7 million yuan, up 1.8 million yuan from the previous day. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also rose by 700,000 to 1 million yuan across the board.</p>
<p>In yesterday's cotton cloth market, many sellers took advantage of the high prices to sell at the morning opening, and the market once declined. However, around 10:30 a.m., it was reported that the Textile Construction Company was also selling low-end fine cloth, and Yuan Biji was not opened, which caused the buying sentiment to recover and the asking price to turn from soft to firm. Around 11:45 a.m., yarn prices rose again, and market prices rose step by step. Finally, the prices of various fine cloths rose again by 7,000 to 20,000 yuan across the board. The prices of other bleached cloths, Biji, and Shilin cloths also continued to rise by 5,000 to 30,000 to 40,000 yuan across the board.</p>
<p>Textile Construction Sells Cloth</p>
<p>[Our Dispatch] The China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 56,300 pieces, with a total of 1,427 purchase orders. Internal manufacturers submitted 39 orders, purchasing 5,280 pieces of cloth. The cloth number was 1,388, and 51,020 pieces of cloth were purchased　.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Prices Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton market was first flat and then firm. Yarn factories watched as the price of flowers rose to a peak for several consecutive days and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Due to tight credit, the industry turned from entering to exiting. The trend in the middle was once slightly fatigued. Later, as the closing price of cotton yarn rose again, the sentiment was stable, and the shorts covered their positions, and trading resumed. As a result, prices mostly rose, and the total transaction volume for the day was about 2,000 bales.</p>

<h3>History of Chinese Art</h3>
<p>— Written by Wen Zhaotong and Hu Man</p>
<p>Published by Qunyi Publishing House</p>
<p>There are not many published works on the history of Chinese art in the country. There are only the following:</p>
<p>A Short History of Chinese Art: Written by Teng Gu: Commercial Press</p>
<p>History of Chinese Art: Written by Zheng Chang: Zhonghua</p>
<p>Introduction to the History of Chinese Art: Edited by Li Puyuan; Liangyou</p>
<p>The Evolution of Chinese Art; Written by Wang Junchu: Wenxin</p>
<p>A History of the Development of Chinese Art: Written by Liu Sixun: Commercial Press</p>
<p>Among them, except for the two books by Li and Wang, which are written with scientific historical perspectives after careful consideration, most of the others are written using the method of chronological division. The two books by Zheng and Liu use painting, calligraphy, architecture, sculpture, and crafts as the warp and use chronological narratives. Although we cannot completely and definitively say which path the method of historical writing should take, at least, in recent years, in the vigorous atmosphere of new historical research in China, writing according to a historical perspective that is closer to science may be easier to arouse interest. The Hu's "History of Chinese Art" that I am going to introduce now was written under this premise.</p>
<p>This book is divided into twelve chapters, which are generally similar to Wang's book, but more substantial, and there are also novel discoveries in terms of historical materials and textual research. For example:</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of the "Six Principles of Painting," according to the research of Japanese scholar Kinbara Shogo, Xie He's theory was deeply influenced by Gu Kaizhi. This statement has almost become a conclusion in the field of Chinese painting theory. However, in this book, it is said: "Chinese painting at that time was influenced by Western art. From the Han Dynasty, Persian merchant ships traveled to Guangzhou for trade, which became even more prosperous in the Eastern Jin Dynasty. The Indian monk Faxian took a Persian merchant ship. At that time, oil painting methods were brought from Persia... Although this oil painting method was not fully applied to painting by Chinese painters in the Jin Dynasty, it obviously existed in Jin Dynasty painting, especially in the portraits of emperors of the Six Dynasties, with techniques of sketching from life, such as chiaroscuro, which is the source of the Chinese 'concave-convex method.' This sketching method is one of the basic conditions for the formation of the 'Six Principles.' In addition, it was also considerably influenced by the general art of Greece and Mesopotamia. The Greek-style stone pillars and Assyrian-style winged stone beast carvings in the tombs of the Six Dynasties are clear evidence. Moreover, 'Sadanage' in Indian Buddhist painting: Recognition of phenomena, correct feeling, scale and structure, emotional movement in form, the expression of Athenian art, hieroglyphics, the use of colors and shades. Although these six points are not entirely the same as the meaning of the 'Six Principles,' Indian Buddhist paintings have long been introduced to China, and it is possible that their painting methods came with them. Since these Western arts gradually spread to China and gave new stimulation to Chinese art, in the Six Dynasties, the 'Six Principles' were produced. It is a new painting method that comprehensively integrates Western methods and all previous Chinese methods. This is the true source of the outline of the 'Six Principles,' and it is not like Xie He himself deliberately mystifying it, and therefore he did not give the 'Six Principles' a corresponding development." (Pages 60-61).</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Northern and Southern Schools of landscape painting, this is a division since Dong Qichang. Bei Shi once said: "The family has the Northern and Southern Schools, which began to be divided in the Tang Dynasty. The Northern and Southern Schools of Zen are also divided in the Tang Dynasty." (Notes from the Painting Room). The author believes that this is a historical truncation. The book writes:</p>
<p>"In the Northern and Southern Dynasties, two great painters in the Southern Liang Dynasty pioneered the independent development of landscape painting. At the same time, they also became the ancestors of the Northern and Southern Schools. One was Zhang Sengyou, who used heavy blue and green colors on silk to paint mountains, springs, rocks, hills, and jagged cliffs, and then added colors. This is the 'blue-and-green landscape' school. Even within a short distance, one can feel ten thousand miles away." These two great painters, one was Zheng Fashi (from Hebei), who learned from Zhang Sengyou. His pavilion paintings received such comments: "He is committed to carving through stones, and paints trees with many made-up patterns." Undoubtedly.</p>
<p>"Therefore, I believe that the division of the Northern and Southern Schools of landscape painting originated from Zhang Sengyou and Xiao Yi in the Northern and Southern Dynasties, and passed through Zheng Fashi and Zhan Ziqian to become the two major schools of the North and South. In the Tang Dynasty, the so-called 'Southern School' and 'Northern School' appeared, which meant the style of following the Southern or Northern Schools." (Pages 57-58).</p>
<p>We believe that this type of discovery is a unique insight. Originally, the author's purpose in writing this book was also unique. In the "Preface," it says:</p>
<p>"The creation of art and the theory of art are inextricably linked. If we want to obtain the correct direction of art activities and the methods of art creation, we must study the origins, changes, and laws of the occurrence and development of our national art. That is to say, we must critically accept the heritage of history. Therefore, based on archaeological excavations, actually existing art materials, historical and unofficial records about art, and various technical books, it is necessary to conduct comprehensive research and scientific analysis. At the same time, we must break the misunderstandings and distortions of Chinese art by vulgar scholars, and break those prejudices that have arisen under feudalism and capitalism, and that have been poisoned by their 'education.'"</p>
<p>From this book, we can eliminate the following prejudices: The prejudice that Chinese art is isolated, the prejudice that Chinese art should be completely Westernized, and the prejudice that Chinese and Western art should be reconciled. If art workers can stand on the position of the people, these prejudices will naturally disappear, and the true image of the history of Chinese art will naturally be seen very clearly.</p>
<h3>"Today's Outer Mongolia" Written by Pan Gongzhao Published by China Science Company</h3>
<p>Recently, the issue of Outer Mongolia has attracted much attention both domestically and internationally, but Chinese people have very little accurate understanding of the truth about Outer Mongolia. The books about Outer Mongolia published by the publishing industry are old stories from before the war, fragmented and incomplete, and those who want to see the whole picture of Outer Mongolia often sigh. The publication of Mr. Pan Gongzhao's book "Today's Outer Mongolia" (People's Republic of Mongolia) can be called the first Chinese document studying the current situation of Outer Mongolia.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into nine parts and twenty-four chapters, which introduce in detail the geography, history, ethnic distribution, living conditions, customs and habits, national economy, finance and finance, animal husbandry, agriculture, industry, mining, resources, commerce and foreign trade, revolutionary process, political construction, political party organization, military strength, social and cultural status of Outer Mongolia. It also has more detailed explanations of the relationship between China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia, the leading figures of Mongolia, and the research institutions of the Soviet Union on Mongolia. The beginning of the book also has a preface by Lei Fazhang, the former Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs who was specially appointed by the Central Government to supervise the Outer Mongolia independence vote. There is also a preface by Maisky, an expert on Soviet Mongolian issues. The end of the book also has the full text of the current constitution of Outer Mongolia. In addition, the national flag of Outer Mongolia, landscape photos, etc., are rarely seen outside of Mongolia, which is very precious.</p>
<p>This book is published by China Science Company and is sold by Life Bookstore and others. (Yu)</p>
<h3>"A Comprehensive Record of Chinese Local Chronicles"</h3>
<p>— Ji Dan</p>
<p>In Zhu Shijia's "Comprehensive Record of Chinese Local Chronicles," published by the Commercial Press before the war, the following record was found regarding "Pingxiang County Chronicle": Book Title, Number of Volumes, Compiler's Surname, Year, Collection Institution, Pingxiang County Chronicle, Eight Volumes, Compiled by Shang Chongnian, Kangxi 22, Beijing. Nanjing. Palace Museum. Liu's. Cabinet. Same, Right, 12 Volumes, Compiled by Xu Shengwu, Qianlong 49, Nanjing. Same, Right, 16 Volumes, Compiled by Huang Jun, This Light, Guoxue Same, Right, 11 Volumes, Compiled by Chen Qiaocong, Xianfeng 10, Nanjing. Guoxue.</p>
<p>Zhongshan. Culture. Beijing Same, Right, 11 Volumes Compiled by Xi Rong, Tongzhi 11, . Ren's. Xuhui. Liu's. Yanjing. External Department.</p>
<p>It is the case that Zhu's book was compiled based on the catalogs of various collection institutions and did not seem to be based on the original medical text. Therefore, regarding the compilers, years, and versions of "Pingxiang County Chronicle," there are bound to be omissions. Now, based on the original of "Pingxiang County Chronicle" from Tongzhi 11th year and private collections, I have written an article titled "The Evolution of the Compilation of Pingxiang County Chronicle," with a table attached at the end. Now, I will quote it here and try to make a comparison with Zhu's book.</p>
<p>Table of the Evolution of the Compilation of Pingxiang County Chronicle No. Dynasty, Era, Writing Date, Number of Volumes, Chief Compiler First Ming, Zhengde 13 (1518) Gao Gui Second Ming, Wanli 7 (1579) Chang Zixin Third Ming, Wanli 14 (1586) Yao Yili Fourth Ming, Wanli 24 (1596) Lu Shiji Fifth Qing, Kangxi 2nd (1683) Eight Shang Chongnian Sixth Qing, Qianlong 49 (1784) Three Xu Shengwu Seventh Qing, Jiaqing 16 (1811) Twenty Zhang Pengfu Eighth Qing, Daoguang 3 (1823) Six Huang Jun Ninth Qing, Tongzhi 11 (1872) 10 Wang Ming</p>
<p>It is found that there are three points that should be corrected in Zhu's book. First: The Huang Jun compilation article should be corrected to Daoguang 3rd year. Second: The Xi Rong compilation article should be corrected to Wang Ming; the compilation of this chronicle was initiated by Xi Rong, and Wang began to complete it, as seen in the preface written by Wang. Third: The Chen Qiaocong compilation article is unreliable. According to the "Yuanzhou Prefecture Chronicle" of Tongzhi 13th year, there is Chen Qiaocong's "Preface to the Essential Points of Yuanzhou Prefecture and County Chronicles," which narrates in detail: "In the winter of Xianfeng 9th year, Qiaocong received a letter from the governor and temporarily held the seal of this prefecture. At the beginning of his arrival, following the old practice, he requested the prefecture chronicle, but the boards were destroyed by the bandits and could not be recovered. He requested various chronicles, but they all said that the boards and registers had been lost after the bandits, and he felt deeply embarrassed. For several months, in meeting with people from the prefecture, he often searched for remaining books and gradually found various old chronicles of the prefecture and counties. In his spare time, he opened and read them and thought of discussing with the people of the prefecture to re-collect and revise the new chronicle, but only because he was in a time of many events and difficulties, his strength could not reach it. Considering that the prefecture and county chronicles are really related to politics, even if the new chronicle cannot be continued, it is not the responsibility of the soldiers to let the old chronicles be buried? ... Qiaocong then took various chronicles and extracted the evolution, boundaries, capitals, villages, city walls, mountains, rivers, water conservancy, passes, terrain, land taxes, population, schools, government offices, military garrisons, bridges, and post stations, and other important elements, and first paid for engraving. According to the old books, they were used as evidence of transmission; in the future, they were used as a place for continuation. Readers should appreciate his hard work and do not blame him for being incomplete." At the beginning of the same book, "The Surnames of the Prefects Who Have Revised the Prefecture Chronicle": "Engraved in the Gengshen year of Xianfeng, the prefect Chen Qiaocong." It means that "Pingxiang County Chronicle" and "Yuanzhou Prefecture Chronicle" were re-printed and published in the same year, not formally compiled, which is self-evident. At that time, it was just after the failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and local government affairs were waiting to be revived. Therefore, Chen urgently printed this chronicle as a basis for administering politics. Therefore, that article should also be revised to Chen reprinting, so as to avoid spreading rumors. Moreover, among the books, situations similar to the above should not be small. We sincerely hope that Zhu will take advantage of the establishment of the Provincial and County Literature Committees to conduct a universal investigation, and then revise this book carefully so that it can be perfected. I donate this proposal, and I think that all scholars engaged in local chronicles in the country are also happy to advocate and support it.</p>
<h3>Publishing News</h3>

It is very suitable for university and college textbooks. It has been printed by China Science Company and will be published in mid-October.</p>
<p>The two books "Today's Outer Mongolia" and "Today's India" written by Pan Gongzhao are published by China Science Company. The book "Today's India" is indeed the most detailed description of India in today's publishing industry. All the movements of India before July of this year have been described in detail. It also comes with beautiful illustrations, a total of fourteen chapters, ninety-five sections, more than six hundred and forty pages, about five hundred thousand words.</p>
<h3>Review of "World Politics Handbook"</h3>
<p>— Wei Yang</p>
<p>In the current world where international political dynamics are extremely complex and subtle, it is not easy to understand the essence of the politics of various countries. Most books discussing international politics are either biased or have different backgrounds. When choosing, the author is in danger of being misled if he is not careful. Taking the "World Politics Handbook 1947" edited by Chen Yuan, which was recently published by Life Bookstore, for example, although the editor proclaimed in the preface that "we strive to analyze the evolution and development of the politics and economy of various countries during and after the war from a new perspective and from the standpoint of the people," we deeply feel after reading it that the editor's attitude is very problematic. It can be found in many places in the book that he is looking at the world from the perspective of the Soviet Union and looking at China from the standpoint of the Chinese Communist Party!</p>
<p>This biased attitude is already evident in the "Reference Materials Used" section of the book's preface. The domestic newspapers listed in that section for the editor's reference, in addition to Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, are the Times Daily and Xinhua Daily. In such a large country as China, with thousands of newspapers, why only choose these few?</p>
<p>In the Chinese section of the book, the editor described the process of negotiations and the breakdown of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, and did not mention a word about the arrogance, ambition, and breach of contract of the Communist Party. In the lines, he implicitly attributed the responsibility for the spread of the civil war to the government. Furthermore, more than three hundred pages were used to publish the military positions of both sides on January 13, 1946, which the Communist Party demanded to be restored. In fact, everyone understands that the so-called "liberated areas" maintained by the Communist Party at that time were the result of expanding the territory at the end of the Anti-Japanese War, and it was only natural for the government to recover them. The editor's other intentions can be seen here.</p>
<p>In the chapter on "The United States," the Truman government is first attacked as "reversing the course of history," and the anti-Soviet elements in the Democratic and Republican parties are referred to as "reactionaries." Then, it is pointed out that the United States is using gold-dollar diplomacy to invade the world. However, the impact of the Soviet Union's activities on the US foreign policy after the war is ignored and not discussed at all. On the contrary, in the chapter on "The Soviet Union," not a word is mentioned about the Soviet Union's various attempts to expand its territory after the war and its unfriendly attitude towards our country. The behavior of the Soviet Union in signing non-aggression treaties with Germany and Japan in the early stage of World War II is deliberately defended. All of this makes one wonder if the book was published by the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>In other parts of the book, eight or nine out of ten are copied from the 1947 World Politics Handbook compiled by the American Foreign Relations Association, and even the arrangement procedure is still arranged in the order of the letters of the English names of the countries, so there is a lack of geographical connection. There are many typographical errors in the English original names attached to the book. In addition, the geographical location of various countries that have an important relationship with international politics is not introduced, which is the shortcoming of the book.</p>
<h3>Examining “Ode to Mount Ling” Through Commentary on "Ode to Mount Ling"</h3>
<p>Logically, I should have read "Ode to Mount Ling" before reading its critique. However, I first read Mr. Mei Lin of the Ta Kung Pao's "The Realm and Character of Ode to Mount Ling," and only then felt compelled to look at "Ode to Mount Ling" itself. This is because I am not only dissatisfied with the "Ode to Mount Ling" introduced in Mr. Mei Lin's "The Realm and Character of Ode to Mount Ling," but I also find his introduction and criticism confusing and hollow.</p>
<p>Let's take the two poems, "Vibration" and "Gaze," cited by Mr. Mei Lin as examples. After carefully appreciating and savoring them, I believe that the so-called "character" is only expressed in the two lines, "Alas, what pious pride, and even more, what proud piety," which have some meaning. As for the rest, we can not only arrange them into prosaic and unfluent sentences, but phrases like "fields stretch wide," "yet I see you more filled and—far beautiful," "...strength of mind sprouts," "...nurturing wilderness," seem simply a somewhat clumsy accumulation. The vocabulary such as "stretch wide," "far beautiful," "sprouts," and "nurturing wilderness," we not only rarely hear in spoken language, but also struggle to find in past written vocabulary. Granted, the beauty of poetry lies in its conciseness and implicitness, enabling it to convey meaning beyond direct words, a tune beyond the strings, at least to be able to express a certain image and artistic conception that it wants to express. However, we cannot select it to be as constricted as a small-footed woman, or even strive for novelty while failing to express any sentiment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the impression these two poems give us is merely the emotional foam of disillusionment and contradiction of intellectuals. We do not smell any Promethean-like heroic sanctity, only a chaotic spinning within the author's small circle of bewildered emotions. The author does not, like Shelley, give us a more accurate portrayal of that fire-stealing Prometheus, nor create an otherworldly realm beyond the ordinary. Yet Mr. Mei Lin emptily praises this illusory thing with all sorts of descriptive vocabulary. I wonder what basis this kind of review is based on? From the poem itself, we cannot obtain a unified and progressively complete concept, nor can we gain a clearer impression through its introduction.</p>
<p>"This magnificent and tragic whirlpool of blood, this heavy breaking of the earth's crust, arises from the desperate entanglement of life, history, and the times, from the most intense and resolute internal struggles, from the blood droplets of the soul, from the stubbornness of steel, from the fiery heat of volcanoes, from the unceasing white hair, from countless wrinkles, from the sublime character resembling Mount Ling...."</p>
<p>This is Mr. Mei Lin's heap of empty and irrelevant descriptions of "Ode to Mount Ling." But if we examine the realm and character of "Ode to Mount Ling" from the perspective of "the most intense" to "the fiery heat of volcanoes," it feels even more vague and elusive. We do not know what is meant by "the most intense," nor what kind of realm and character the fiery heat of volcanoes represents. Honestly, describing any work with such disjointed and empty adjectives is simply like a blind man senselessly talking about the weather; it is impossible to grasp the essence of the work itself. No matter how moving the words are, the resulting effect probably does not even reach one-ten-thousandth of what is being praised. Because the talent of a critic is not just about using a set of beautiful descriptive vocabulary to complete his critical purpose of the work without any basis, but rather about more concretely and appropriately pointing out its merits and demerits from the close, abstract, and broad aspects of the work itself. As for the author's gains and losses, benefits and harms, the critic cannot be biased. As Mr. Mei Lin in the first paragraph pressed down what..."a steel hoop-like pressing cold light, the solemnity of a saint-like absolute unyielding" inflated speaking hat, and then made his own self-justifying answer; after using all the empty rhetoric of history, it is not enough to smear the essence of the facts. Then, speaking of the realm and character expressed in "Ode to Mount Ling," the author's attitude toward the world, even if there are admirable aspects, but from the work itself that reveals the rules, we not only cannot compare it with Shelley's "Prometheus Unbound," but even with Mr. Guo Moruo's "The Dog of Heaven," we cannot put them on the same level. Now let me briefly discuss what I have seen after reading "Ode to Mount Ling" due to this curiosity:</p>
<p>"Ode to Mount Ling" is undoubtedly completed by the author's lack of poetic cultivation and the excessive emotions of intellectuals pursuing fantasy. Therefore, in terms of technique, the tone is not bright and lively, and the expression of the artistic conception is not unrestrained and transcendent. However, because the author seems sincere as a person, he also reveals the illusions and contradictions that the author has in the poetic realm between skillfully expressing inner emotional changes. This kind of attitude should be discussed separately. Speaking of writing poetry, the author is obviously unfamiliar, such as the use of "resignation," "grayish reflection," "locked in..." such "beautiful" and "far beautiful," as well as "forever beautiful light shining life," "...light glowing years" and other poetic phrases and vocabulary, rather than saying that we want it to be understood by adding annotations and secret codes, it is better to say that they are bones seen with fat condiments.</p>
<p>The artistic conception of Ode to Mount Ling, perhaps what Mr. Mei Lin calls "realm," how far and deep does it ultimately reach? From the book itself, it does not, like Shelley, still carve an artistic conception with temporal and spatial creation within the wondrous and unknowable limits of creation. We compare these poems with Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind," "To a Skylark," or Gorky's "Song of the Stormy Petrel," and discerning people will naturally not find it difficult to appreciate the height of their expressive power.</p>
<p>As for "Gaze" and "Vibration," they are really not as good as the sighs of a patient in a hazy state of consciousness. When the patient is clear-headed, he will say insightful words that are difficult for good people to think of. When the condition is severe, he will say scary nonsense. The author is only in this state of a patient. This is also the author's naiveté and sincerity in writing. From another perspective, it seems to have something to take. If this is taken as the highest realm expressed by "Ode to Mount Ling," it truly cannot help but make people feel regretful and confused.</p>
