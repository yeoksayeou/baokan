<h3>蔣主席招待參政員懇切說明日前時局</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕蔣主席廿八日午十二時半，就官邸邀宴參政員中之敎授多人，參加者有張伯苓，許德珩，張瀾，吳貽芳等，主席於席閒徵詢各氏對學潮及和平之意見，許德珩首謂：靑年學生均極純潔，盼政府對學潮之處理能有所考慮。渠認學潮問題與和平問題有連帶關係，當將和平問題提出意見，主席表示承認學生之純潔，但認爲不免受外力之利用，政府當以台理辦法處理。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕蔣主席於廿八日下午七時半就勵志社歡宴全體參政員，並即席致詢，歷一小時許始畢。蔣主席首就當前軍，政，經濟大勢予以說明，在軍事方面，主席表示前途要樂觀。經濟方面，目前雖感危機，但我國以農爲本，經濟問題決無崩潰之處。關於當前學潮，主席稱：此次學潮之成因，多部係受共黨之煽動，彼等且揚言於共黨之紀念日六日二日大舉遊行，更足佐證。政府對擾亂份子當依維持治安辦法辦理。出席今晚宴會之政府長官，有孫科，于右任，居正，陳啓天等，至下午九時許始散。</p>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕蔣主席於廿八日下午七時半，在勵志社召宴全體國民參政員席終，起立致詞，對目前時避有所說明，茲誌演詞大要如次：（一）參政會開幕以來，已逾一週，各位參政員爲國家憂勸盡職硏究如何安定時局辦法此種精神，至可寳貴。相信我們共同一致發揚爲國，爲民的精神，必能突破任何危險困難。而且中華民國的建設，必可早日完成。（二）現在國內經濟社會政治各方面，誠然有不少缺點需要坦白檢討和改革，但是最緊要的，在使人民皆能明是非，別利害，如果是非不明，利害不分，即爲國家禍亂之根源。余以爲，當前國家最大之隱憂，在於是非觀念之混淆與利苦認識之不明，以致喪失共同之目標。參政員諸君開會以來，正在苦心研究如何使國家和平統一，人民安居樂業，但余以爲，諸君最大之貢獻，在於爲全國人民作領導，使之明瞭何者爲是，何者爲非，蓋公是公非之所在，即爲大利大害之所係，此爲安定時局之最大關鍵。（三）今日社會凋敝，人民痛苦，對於企求和平，人同此心，心同此理，本席個人自敵寇投降後，年餘以來，爲何委曲求全，忍辱負重，用種種方法，以求得國內和平之經過，諸君皆所週知。今日吏要痛切坦白言之者，即國家在八年抗戰之後，如果國內還有戰事，即爲整個國家之恥辱，任何有責任心之政府，斷不願以武力解決間題，此爲顯而易見之事，假使共產黨尙有絲毫之誠意來謀取和平，政府一定願意以政治方法來解決。但在共產黨迫使政府不得不以武力過止破壞統一之武裝行動時，而若干社會輿論只以戰事資任加之政府，旦反對征兵，征糧，全不思此種痛苦之原因係何方所造成，亦未聞有爲匪區民衆水深火熟之生活而作呼號者，如此是非不明，則於事實何補。所謂和談，應該是雙方的，余可申明，政府對政治解決與和平統一之方針，始終不變。祗要共產黨具備誠意，伸出手來，政府爲保存國家元氣，解除人民痛苦，對於貴會具證有效之任何建議，無不歡迎。</p>
<p>此次學潮性質複雜切望各校協助消患</p>
<p>（四）此次學潮性質之複雜，爲以前所未有，共產黨本有一定之計劃，在前方加緊軍事進攻，在各地即加緊搗亂社會，而我靑年學生適爲其所利用之工具，此次共黨始而策動學生就其本身利益作種種過份要求，繼乃轉變學潮爲反對內戰，反對徵兵，征糧，其發生與演變之經過，明眼人自能知之。其規定六月二日爲總罷課游行之日期，並號召罷市·罷工·決非偶然，實因六月二日乃去年延安發動所謂反內戰運動之紀念日，政府早已獲知此項計劃，爲保護大多數靑年不受陰謀家之摧殘，並爲維持社會之秩序，故不能不採預防之措置，因此，國民政府乃頒布維持社會秩序臨時辦法，而余個人所發表談話，明吿靑年勿中共黨之毒計，吾人雖已如此警誡，但仍望社會領袖與學校當局協助政府，爲靑年學生指明眞正是非利害之所在。靑年爲國家之新生命，吾人必當愛護，但決不可姑息，古人說，姑息養奸，吾人應知，姑息足以長禍，不能因循放縱，敗壞學風，犧牲國家之法令，妨害社會之秩序，尤其當此共黨盡量煽惑之時，第一要義必須將校內共黨暴動份子與一般學生分別淸楚，使共黨不能混雜搗亂。吾人有培育靑年之責任，必當竭盡一切力量，多方設法，不使有不幸事件發生，希望大家明瞭政府之苦心，採取一致嚴正之能度，尤其各地學校當局，必須與政府合作，共同負責，庶可消患於未形。（五）關於軍事情形，亦欲簡單叙述，目前各綫雖無顯著進展，然預定計劃均已達成，前方將士爲國效命，忠勇堅決之精神，始終旺盛，決不使共黨得逞其任意竄擾之陰謀。現南北各重要據點，均已次第收復，國軍正嚴密戒備，監視共產黨軍隊次一步之行動，在共產黨未能衷誠接受貴會謀取和平之建議而有具體結果以前，國軍決不鬆弛其保障國家根本之努力。繼由參政會主席團主席林虎答詞，略謂：「今日承主席於日理萬機之餘，專賜招待，不勝感謝，回憶本會成立於抗戰之時，對國家·社會得有貢獻，皆賴主席賢明之指導，現在國家正向民主建設之道邁進，政府對民意機關之扶植，對各級民意之尊重，甚令吾人興奮，適纔主席之致詞，誠懇詳盡，希望主席此種賢明之精神，感召各級政府。各級民意機關，共同一致，爲國家之安定與進步而努力」。</p>
<h3>長江航運腐敗應請速予改善</h3>
<p>審査會中臨時動議</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕參政員梁繼光，池在靑等數十人，爲長江航運問題，於廿八日在參政會全體審査會提出臨時動議，經決定交付審查。其案由如次：「爲長江航運腐敗日甚，應請速加有效改善，並請究明中亞輪船失事責任及善後處置案」。</p>
<h3>「解總」辦事處昨電覆參政會</h3>
<p>〔中央社本市訊〕中共派駐行總工作人員，前日接獲參政會促請中共參政員赴京出席之來電後以負責人伍雲甫已赴山東中共救濟區視察，當以「解總」駐滬辦事處名義，於昨晨電覆參政會，該電稱：南京參政會主席團轉全體大會公鑒，貴會宥電抵滬時，適値伍雲甫先生離滬赴敝區視察救濟工作之時，致渠本人未及收閱。唯査烟台行總電台與敝區任何中共電台並無聯絡，故自董必武先生等離京後，敝會與陜北之通訊聯絡已全吿斷絕，所囑轉電一節，苦於無法從命，違命之處，幸希見諒，謹此電覆。」據悉：上海行總電台與山東中共區域保持聯絡者有烟合，惠民，石白所三處，過去中共當局致上海函電，多由滬烟綫傳送者，延安收復後，傳遞時間容或延長，但當不致斷絕，故中共留滬人員不予拍發參政會邀電，其原因何在不得而知矣。</p>
<h3>穩定幣值縝密研究外匯率目前無變更　董顯光在記者招待會宣稱</h3>
<p>〔中央社南京廿八日電〕行政院新聞局長董顯光廿八日下午四時半於記者招待會中，答復記者詢問如次：</p>
<p>問，政府對於學生擬於六月二日作全國性之示威運動，有何處置？</p>
<p>答，政府於五月廿九日公布之維持社會秩序辦法，制止擾亂社會秩序及妨害公安之示威及遊行，政府及學校當局現正盡最大努力，勸導學生勿作違法行動。</p>
<p>問，政府有無計劃或意向，將學生或其他參加示威運動之人徵召從軍？</p>
<p>答，本人未聞政府有此種計劃或意向。</p>
<p>問，財政部兪部長最近在參政會報吿，謂政府正考慮穩定幣制，能將此說之詳細涵義見告否？</p>
<p>答，自上屆參政會建議政府穩定通貨以來，政府即縝密研究此項問題，目前並無改變外匯匯率之計劃。</p>
<p>問，請吿最近之軍事情勢，尤其東北方面之軍事情形如何？共軍對長春之威脅確已解除否？</p>
<p>答，東北上星期之戰事，集中於長春及四平街之周圍共軍，出動六萬人，其第一師及第三師，於五月廿日開始進攻四平街，同時，韓共第三縱隊及第一·第二獨立師之部隊，則進攻長春·四平街一帶，曾發生激戰。共軍第一及第三師蒙受慘重損失，殘部業已後退。長春一帶共軍，亦已後退，傷亡約三千人，此外，另有三萬共軍，企圖奪取永吉，並未得逞。李紅光及楊靖宇統率之五萬共軍，係中共及韓共之混合部隊，在南部通化以北之梅河口及渭津河口一帶竄擾。山東及山西戰塲，並無新發展。</p>
<p>問，政府有抑平米價漲風之具體措施否？</p>
<p>答，政府力求糧價合理穩定之辦法，本人於五月七日業經有所說明。此種辦法現正積極施行，目前尤其注意於疏暢糧食之運輸，俾有餘糧之省縣得迅速運濟重要都市。長江水位增漲之後，糧食運輸之困難，即可漸次减少。董氏除答復記者所提問題之外，復發表消息兩則如下：（一）全國經濟委會昨在政院舉行首次會議，張院長曾吿出席之卅四位委員稱，該會爲解決中國經濟問題之參謀本部。張院長兼任該會主席不設副主席，（二）昨行政院會議通過設立外匯審核委會，該會以財政部長爲主席，其餘委員由行政院秘書長，國府主計長，審計部長及中央銀行總裁担任之，嗣後審核外匯，由該委會全權處理。</p>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕關於滬文匯。新民。聯合三報停刋事，新聞局廿八日下午四時半之記者招待會中，會有記者提出詢問新聞局之態度。董局長答稱，此次上海淞滬警備司令部執行三報停刋事，係根據戒嚴法，警備部有此權執行。關於此事處理經過，滬警察局已呈報內政部。</p>
<h3>有關中共及和平提案　參政會審查完竣　交特委會制訂具體方案</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕參政會廿八日以竟日時間舉行全體審查會，研討和平問題，出席之參政員及旁聽之政府長官，來賓，均較已往各次會議爲多，足證各方對和平問題之重視。參政員請求發言者，數逾五十人，紛陳其個人意見及辦法。結果會中通過主席國決定組織有關和平問題提案之特種委員會，制訂具體方案。各參政員發言紀錄，一併交付該會。至審査會中發言者之趨向，一部份參政員以中共在其控制區內肆意横行，民衆痛苦不堪，主張應請政府明令戡亂。來自北方各省之參政員，對此主張最力。意見折衷者，則主張由大會向政府，中共雙方呼籲和平，以此次和談爲對中共和平誠意之最後試騐。認爲目前絕不應繼續作戰者，雖亦有人主張，但就會塲空氣視之，似難實現其意旨。</p>
<p>廿八日上午之全體審査會，由李璜主席。出席參政員二一七人，九時廿五分宣布開會，李璜即席說明四點：（一）提案不再一一宣讀，以節時間。（二）欲發言者請書面通知主席。（三）發言時間仍以五分鐘爲限。（四）提案人說明亦以五分鐘爲限。是時主席台上已積請求發言條甚多，其後復陸續增加。惟因發言者多不能遵守五分鐘之限制，致上午開會時間，雖有三小時之久，獲機會發言者，僅陳紹賢，梁上棟，沙彥楷，王寒生，伍純武，王普涵，周謙冲，李鴻文，江恒源，杜荀若，杜希夷，呂雲章，盧前，何葆仁，黄宇人，翟倉陸，張金鑑，胡秋原，王冬珍，姚延芬，陳耀東，許德珩，張一善，潘朝英，李樹茂，潘連茹，孔庚，江一平等廿九人，至十二時卅分散會。</p>
<p>發言者之唯一共同點，即首闡明和平爲全國上下之迫切要求，無人反對。惟求得和平之方法，則分爲兩大派，一派主張進行和談，以和平求和平，另一派主張不必和談，直接下令戡亂，以武力求和平。前者又分兩種意見，其一爲以此次和談作對中共和平誠意之最後試騐，其一認爲目前形勢不能再繼續作戰，武力解決爲不可能，應求政治解決。主張以和談作對中共之試騐者人數最多。陳紹賢謂：政府與中共所提和談先決條件，距離甚遠，縮短此項距離，爲本會今日之目的，故彼主張由本會以嚴正能度，請中共參政員來京出席，商和平之策。沙彥楷謂，恢復和談，應「不算舊賬，不講法律」，俾談判得順利進行。渠主張「以選舉代替戰爭」。王寒生指出過去數次和談失敗之敎訓，認爲此次應注意三個問題：（一）看中共有無和平決心，（二）和平方法應爲軍令統一，政令統一，（三）應規定進行和談之步驟。杜荀若於敍述共軍進入東北後之暴行後，認爲共軍不以割據某一地區爲滿足，渠主張以和平求和平如不能作到，即應以全國力量助政府戡亂。盧前同意葉道淵之提案，補充三點意見：（一）本會保持超然立塲，（二）公開協商經過及雙方意見，（三）政治，軍事同時商談。何葆仁謂：應對中共和平誠意作最後試騐，如中共仍無誠意，即請政府勘亂。黄宇人懷疑中共之和平誠意，渠認爲（一）和平絕非分贓，（二）和平應儘連實現，其辦法爲向國共雙方呼籲和平，浩成公正與論，請全國人民持公正能度，由本會派代表參與和談。胡秋原就王曉籟之提案加以說明，主張提出超然主動之和平方案，此方案應1雙方撤銷先決條件，2不究旣往，3尊重事實，承認事實，4遵守政協原則及精神。凡不接受本會方案之一方，應負戰爭責任。陳耀東謂：政府中共雙方應均對先決條件讓步，以公正態度談判，紙許成功，不許失敗。孔庚之和談意見，與衆不同，渠主張在談判成功前，不得停戰，其理由爲中共不講信義，不能再上當。江一平希望糾正中共之作風與態度，雙方不究旣往，研討公正合理方法，以求解決。主張不用武力解決，必須恢復和談最力者爲許德珩。塲認爲「打下去不得了」，「打十年，廿年仍要和平」，北方民衆生活極艱苦，不應繼續作戰。渠謂，參政會是團結抗戰的機構，戰後是和平團結的機會，應以政治方式解決政治問題。渠並提出學潮，滬三報停刊及維持社會秩序臨時辦法之不當。江恒源認爲，以三五個月解決中共旣不可能，故應由本會派代表與中共商談，再組和平期成會等團體，會商辦法。江謂：如此問題解決，學潮亦可平息。至主張不必和談及直接下令戡亂者，爲數亦多。梁上棟謂；目前大多數人希望和平，是希望政府派兵打平中共，以求和平。渠在抗戰期間犧牲右臂，現願在討共中犧牲左臂。伍純武認國共雙方均有獨佔性，先天決定不能停戰言和，惟有請政府出丘戡亂。王普涵亦認爲「不能和」，中共參政員亦絕不會出席大會，責任已明，應集中全國人力物力，用武力以達和平。李鴻文代表北方人民意見，反對無辦法的停戰，免再吃虧。翟倉陸亦主張立即討伐。惟渠謂：討共軍隊紀律，應請軍事長官注意。李樹茂則堅主以軍事行動達到和平之目的。此外，亦有人主張在中共區內發動和平運動，如黄宇人即指出：在政府區以罷工。罷課發動和平運動，中共區反得集中一切力量向國軍進攻，殊不公正。繙朝英提出之意見，爲上午會議中最新穎者。渠解釋「內戰」，「內亂」兩語均爲不當，認爲今日戰爭乃第三國鼓動出來之戰爭，故求解決之策，應從國際方面及外交方面着手，並應宣値此項戰爭之眞正意義，使全世界人士均能了解和平，始有辦法。</p>
<h3>審查會下繼續舉行　參政員熱烈發言　謀取和平途徑各有主張</h3>
<p>〔本報南京廿八日電〕參會全體審查會二十八日午後續舉行，江庸主席，自下午三時半起至下午七時一刻散。各參員繼續發表對和平之意見，計有包一民，燕樹棠，林虎，尹述賢，吳望伋周謙冲，褚輔成，黄炎培，何基鴻，程希孟，王造時，金振玉等卅四人發言，大多數主張，求和不成，請政府即下討伐令，一時會塲內一片討伐聲。</p>
<p>渠等所持理由爲，共軍所到之處，燒殺據掠，民不堪命，痛苦萬狀，而共軍無意和平，談談打打，僅足增加人民更深之痛苦，故主政府即下討伐令。其次有主張以有代價之和平者，有主張派員赴中共區徵詢意見，如中共提出條件而無誠意和平，即決心討伐者。一般而言，咸以打打談談，太使人民痛苦，必須確定對策，以求一勞永逸。另一部份認爲應尊置人民意見，取決和戰。王造時提出停止內戰之意見，認爲內戰之責任，全國各方面均應負之，內戰如再予延續，恐將影響於國際間之戰爭故應迅即停戰，停戰必須有誠意。王氏對進行和談之辦法有三：（一）雙方立即同時全面就地停戰，（二）可開全國和平會議，（三）本會推舉各黨派參政員，組織和平推進會。</p>
<p>周謙冲則提出，政治糾紛應用政治智慧解決。周稱，和平問題首在決心，如人民有決心求和平即可和平，同時認爲，中國問題應在中國解決，在南京解決，且目前爲拉鋸式戰爭，「拉來拉去，人民頭顱都拉掉了」，黄炎培大呼非和平不可，不僅目前老百姓痛苦，將來將更痛苦。黄認爲目前係國家人民生死存亡之關頭，吾人必須想一妥着辦法，以解決之。褚輔成則提出邵從恩之和平提案，予以强調說明，其意見在：（一）由大會決議向政府與中共呼籲和平，並組織和平促成委會，（二）雙方撤銷和談之任何條件，並即日停止全國各地之軍事衝突；（三）和平促成委會應本國民立塲提供意見，使眞正和平早日實現。汪寳暄指出和平應有誠意，不能裝一付悲天憫人的面孔，假惺惺提出和平，應明瞭誰不願和平，謹爲和平之對象。汪稱：「有政權的必需要和平，無政權的才不需要和平，共黨早已否定了政府，吾人爲共黨所否定之政府所聘之參政員，在共黨眼中並無地位，而吾人則高談和平，將以何人爲對象」？汪氏再就許德珩所提學潮及滬三報事稱：「吾人是否即以三報及學生爲對象，三報及學生是否即代表了共黨？」最後稱：「以和平求和平，去年試過，證明不能成功，以戰爭求和平則尙未絕望，所以遲遲未能成功，由於尙有缺陷，吾人應要求政府肅淸貪汚，集中一切力量以謀眞正和平。</p>
<p>劉　靜，包一民，崔震華，武誓彭，厲汝浪，王化民，張邦珍等，均歷述人民痛苦，一致申請討伐。燕樹棠大呼：「我不願意和談，我不忍聽和談，我討厭和談，」張登　稱，和平爲三方面的：（一）爲政府，爲共黨，一爲蘇聯，而目前僅向三分之一的政府要求和平，豈能成功？王澤民認爲有幾點先決條件：第一，雙方無條件停戰；第二，如辦不到，即由雙方民意機關聯合組成人民仲栽委會決定。和平之雙方意見，可提交仲裁會；（四）一方不能接受意見，即可知那一方拒絕人民，雙方人民可一致聲討。其餘仍有認爲參會應居調人地位者，惟下午會中，討伐聲多於和談聲。</p>

<h3>參政會拾零</h3>
<p>— 本報記者　兪振基</p>
<p>廿八日參會全體審査曾，出席參政員達二一七人，爲開會來最熱鬧一日，孫院長·于院長·吳秘書長鐵城亦列席旁聽，長官席上坐無虛席，足證各方關心和平之一斑。</p>
<p>會塲發言盈庭，葉道淵起立提醒主席，如此討論下去必無結果，主席李璜答，主席團對此事先曾加討論，俟各方發言至相當程度，主席團當有處理辦法。</p>
<p>詞人盧茲在發言台上大掉書袋子，高呌「打打談談打打談，漲漲平平漲漲平」如此下去，老百姓吃不消！</p>
<p>大砲黄宇人爲廿八日會中最出風頭人物，他發言前，先向主席遞一紙條，大槪是要求延長發言時間的，事實上他本日發言至少蓬十分鐘，博得掌聲五六次。他的妙句「有在今日情形下民不堪命，官不聯生」，他說和平不是分贓，不能國民黨一塊，共產黨一塊，民社黨一塊，靑年黨一塊，要這樣的話，豈不成了「炸八塊」！</p>
<p>女參政員王冬珍報吿共產黨兩種奇刑，一種呌「上天台」，一種呌「高射砲」，呂雲章亦講了一個故事，這式參政會中，女參政員講故事的很多，並且都講得很生動。</p>
<p>胡鈥原在台上指手舞脚談和平，他太太在旁聽席上督師，胡講畢回坐後不久，他太太亦走了，好像是專爲先生棒塲而來的。</p>
<p>陳耀東大講三國志，他說「天下大勢，分久必合，合久必分，和久必戰，戰久必和」。並說他自己對勸人家夫妻吵架很有經騐，只要有誠意，沒有勸不和的。</p>
<p>老先生孔庚今天又登台表演，講到一半，時閒已到，主席掀鈴，他回頭力爭，並加指摘，他說歷史上只有秦檜講和平，上過共產黨當的人，沒有講和平的，他本人就是一個例子。</p>
<p>江一平不愧名律師，他指出許德珩參政員發言時時間已過，主席一再掀鈴，台下亦屢屢鼓掌催他下來，但他不理，不談法治談民主，是空談，拉鋸式的和談誤盡蒼生。</p>
<p>今日上午發言的廿九位參政員，幾乎沒有一個不超過五分鐘的，台上鈴聲他們充耳不聞，主席阻止亦毫無效果，和平問題太重要了，誰不願意多盞幾句話！（合）</p>
<p>下午開會，最初發言的接連幾位都是女參政員，統計發言的七八位女參政員，無一不主張勘亂的，尤其是幾位東北女參政員發言爲激烈。雲南參政員范永樞發言很幽默，他說「現在和談是空談，唯其是空談，所以我不談」。張邦珍則說：「和平和平，多少罪惡個汝之名而行」。</p>
<p>靑年黨參政員周　冲舉了一個例子，他說：「有一個美國記者由中國到日本，對兩國的印象是等於從一個混亂世界到寂靜天堂」，日本正向復興之路邁進，我們應加警惕。等到周講完了話，有人說發現周是第二次發言，孔庚當向主席抗議，他說：「一個人能講兩次話，我還要講一次」，但這問題並未引起波瀾，因爲周謙冲二次發言別有苦衷，主席團不能不曲予諒解。</p>
<p>王造時說，坐在沙法椅上談打不打問題是不對的。</p>
<p>廢學章在發言台上大談馬克思，結論是「馬克思是頂不要臉的東西」，廖氏正叙述一個蘇聯人的老婆是共產黨，如何如何，主席台上鈴聲大作，廖不待談終即說時間已到，不講了，狀頗滑稽，全傷哄然。</p>
<p>吳望伋希望發勵和平的人，趕快到中共區內呼籲，他講話時大聲疾呼，爲參政員中嗓門最大者。</p>
<h3>參會全體審查會通過　特種委員會名單　計有葉道洲等四十五人</h3>

<h3>俞鴻鈞財政報告（續完）</h3>
<p>改進地方財政：上年政府以改變財政收支系統，爲建國財政所必需，特修改財政收支系統法，將全國財政復劃分爲中央·省（市）·縣（市局）三級，所有各級政府稅源分配，亦重新調整，現在先就制度方面加以檢討，自修訂財政收支系統法實施以後，在地方財政制度上，是互有優點與缺點。優點：1新制劃分全國財政爲三級，系統分明，在財政上略具均權形態，對於實施憲政推行地方自治裨益甚多；2省財政恢復獨立地位，使其漸謀自給，以推動省級自治事業；3縣財政較前更爲充裕，除原有五項自治稅課之外，又分得土地稅（包括田賦）五成，營業稅五成，遺產稅三成，及契稅的全部，並可依法開征因地制宜的特別稅課，以彌補預算，因而鞏固基層自治之基礎。缺點：1稅源劃分尙未完全公允，尤其省稅劃分過少，2營業稅旣明定爲省稅，又規定以半數歸縣，類似省縣共有的稅源，名實不甚相符；3省收入極爲貧乏，省級主要收入僅有田賦二成，營業稅五成，以之支持全省事業，尙雖達到自給自足，縣市財政方面，自改制以後，合法稅源大增，在制度方面，已奠定相當基礙，惟因縣市支出，不一定完全根據法令預算，或自治事業的要求，其中爲了應付上級的命令，或軍事供應，臨時支出往往多於正常支出數倍，故一般仍陷於收支不敷，並以近年來縣市機構單位增多、而且龐大，這也是擬派苛雜不易根絕的　結所在。</p>
<p>再就本部對地方苛雜攤派問題之處理，補充說明一下：查地方攤派及苛雜稅捐，迭經中央嚴禁有案，本部對此問題，早經特加注意，卅五年度一年中，經本部督促廢除之苛捐難稅，已達七十餘種，最近復爲切實澄淸苛雜攤派起見，又擬具辦法五項：1擬再請行政院通令中央各部會署及各省委託縣市辦理之事項，所需經費，應由委託機關指撥專款核示發給；2本預算核定後，如須舉辦地方新興事業，應先依法辦理追加預算，呈奉核准後，方准舉行；3凡非法定征收機關，不得逕向人民征收任何款物，即屬法定征收機關，亦不得向人民征收非法稅捐，或攤派款物違者依刑法第一百廿九條論處；4各縣市長對於所屬各級基層行政機構之非法攤派，如有縱容包庇，或監督不嚴，經人民呈控査實後，應負連帶責任；5各縣政府及鄉鎭保甲人員，如有擅向地方攤派，准由人民列舉事實證據，逕向省政府或中央呈控，經査實後嚴予懲處。上項補充辦法，業經呈請行政院核准施行。</p>
<p>結論：以上報告，是一年以來財政金融的重要設施，今後仍當繼續努力，使財政政策與經濟政策，加緊配合，以增加農工業生產，充裕國民經濟，安定物價平衡收支爲目標，目前財政經濟狀况，雖屬困難，但本人深信祇要大家認淸目標，合力奮鬥，一切難關，仍可不難克服。（完）</p>

<h3>安定民食應採的步驟</h3>
<p>昨日滬市米價下瀉，頭號白粳已降至每石四十萬元關口，比前日約跌去二三萬元左右，但比本年一月底時，仍漲上百分之五二·六强，而且來源是否充沛，供應有無問題，還待官商各界的努力。可知民食問題的嚴重性，迄今還並沒有解除。當地政府正在另組機桃辦理配售，而市參議員對此，亦異常注意，且聞擬有具體辦法六條，提付討論，更足見這個問題的重要和追切了。</p>
<p>總括說來，本問題的焦點有二；一爲數量不足，一爲價格太高。而價格之所以太高，其主要原因，還是由於數量不足。所以根本辦法，斷然應從疎導來源入手，而急則治標，却又不得不從配售做起，以期安定米價，安定人心，並使供應之米糧，能粒粒惠及消費大衆，不再流入囤戶奸商之手。現在配售機構正在組織，貧戶調査亦已普遍着手，其學校與工廠之配米，並已開始發配，上項治標辦法，可稱業已成熟，只待擴充與普及，大體上當無問題，所成爲問題的，只有來源如何充沛這一點。</p>
<p>據吳市長在參議會報吿，本市食米，月需五十萬石，但以一部分市民本喜麵食，一部分廠家可自向產地採辦，實際只須卅餘萬石，已可敷用。而糧食部除每月供給麵粉五十萬包外，其食米之供給量，聞爲十二萬石，本市南北兩市之到米，每日自一二千石至六七千石不等，通扯以五千石計，月可得十五萬石，則全市食米之供求，除有特別原因外，約略已可投合。</p>
<p>所可慮者，此南北兩市之自由到貨，與一部分工廠之直接採辦，其數量過於流動，並不十分可靠。每逢產地市價忽起變動，或運輸途中發生意外，（如扣留或强迫收購等），或本市另訂管制新辦法時（如實施限價，議價，嚴査存米等），米商每每藉爲口實，或暫行停止採辦，或將到貨掯住不賣，其時米價不免重起波動，甚或形成有行無市等局面，則民食危機，依然不能完全消除。所以爲疎暢來源，穩定民食起見，我們認爲對於下列三點，仍有迅速籌維的必要。</p>
<p>（一）安定市面　其目的在安定糧商，使他們能放手採辦，不至遭受到意外的波折與麻煩。其要在合法買賣，予以切實保護，避免一切不必要的干涉，和過於頻繁的緊急措施。此項干涉與緊急措施，倘認爲事實上必要時，亦應格外審愼，務求合情合理合法，以保障其應得的利益。</p>
<p>（二）嚴禁阻撓　此指米糧之運輸而言。自由流通，雖經三令五申，通飭遵照。但據耳目所及，實際上的留難，阻滯，藉端勒索等情弊，仍所不免。且以自由流通之貨物，而事前必須請領採購證，當地必須先行呈騐，請求許可，途中又必須節節査點，請求放行，在法理上，亦屬難以索解之事。實際上，此等故障，無非間接增加米糧採購的成本，故應再由地方當局，呈請中央設法切實改善，以暢來源。</p>
<p>（三）充實存底　來源通暢，存底自裕。但以墊本太重，呆擱爲難。積存較多，又每每引起誤會，招致意外的麻煩。按照現在情形，要正當米商多辦多存，充實民食存底，在事實上，恐屬不可能之事。我們認爲此項任務，應由當地政府籌措資金，自行辦理，至少以儲足兩三個月的米量爲度。庶幾有備無患，足以負荷調節與應變的責任。至於此項米糧，如本國產區不便再行探購，自當另籌辦法，向暹羅或越南等地採辦，故究應向何處採辦，其資金應如何籌措，均係技術土的問題，似可交由民食調配會斟酌辦理。</p>
<p>總之，今日的民食事項，已不是應否籌劃的問題，而已進入於如何籌劃的問題。好得地方政府，業已專設機構，切實担當起來，不以限價，議價，或拋售存米爲滿足了。上項建議，如能分別採擇，見諸施行，相信對於米糧的供求問題，當可順利解決，不必再頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，常常在緊急措施中過生活了！</p>

<h3>日政府仍圖控制　本土周圍各島嶼　對南千島列尤爲重視</h3>
<p>〔中央社東京廿七日電〕日本將在和平會議中努力阻止蘇聯併吞南午島列島，並將請求歸還其投降後被蘇軍佔領之北海道以北之七個島嶼。日政府曾於去年十一月以備忘錄一件提呈盟軍總部，內即涉及上述問題，並附有歷史證明與證件，以支持其立塲，　爲得撫海峽以南之千島列島，向來爲日本之領土，而目下在蘇軍佔領下之齒舞及色丹二羣島，不屬於根據雅爾達協定贈予蘇聯之千島列島之一部份，而乃歷史上及地理上屬於日本四島之一部份。倘南千島列島被置於聯合國託管或類似之措施之下，使日本能在各該島之間，及其周圍捕魚，則日本將威覺滿意，但齒舞及色丹羣島，則必須歸入日本主權之下。日本政府官方發言人解釋稱：日本漁民在齒舞及色丹羣島間，每年捕獲之昆布，價値三百萬日圓，佔日本各島嶼總產量百分之四十，北海道全部昆布之產量佔總產量百分之九十七，在日本全國幾乎無肉食之食料中，實佔生要地位。日本官方强調如蘇聯佔有南千島列島，則將損害北部領海內之日本漁業，蓋因蘇方堅持實施十二英里周圍之限制，此即日本漁船不得進入該範圍內捕魚之謂，亦即實際上將日本漁民摒於南千島列島之外也。日本並希望和會規定辦法，使日本漁船得航行琉球羣島及小笠原羣島一帶，目下並擬建議將九州及琉球間之奄美大島歸還日本。目前該地雖未被佔領，然因盟方規定日本之領土，限在北緯卅度之北，故仍在日本疆域之外。奄美大島於行政上向爲九州鹿兒島之一部，不屬冲繩縣，又其人民及習俗，均與四本島者相同，關於該島，可以應用大西洋憲章中凡與人民自由意識不合者領土不能變更一語。在此方面，日本官方顯係希求對於琉球，甚或南千島列島，如各島處於託管下時，亦施用此種規定；換言之，未來日本，有機會要求公民投票決定。</p>
<h3>日社會黨正式聲明　決放棄四黨組閣　幣原支持吉田新閣益難樂觀</h3>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿八日電〕社會黨於廿八日下午五時發表聲明稱，「社會黨以其第一黨所負之責任，努力組織四黨聯合內閣，而此際自由黨所發表之聲明，非常歪曲事實，片山委員長雖曾對吉田總裁應允左派不入閣，而自由黨仍要求社會黨具體表示不受左派之任何影饗。首相昨日且已向自由黨提出左派不入閣之保證，同時爲實行民主交涉，準備妥協，而自由黨始終不變更能度，雖吾黨以必死之努力，四黨聯合內閣終不可能。今後，社會黨將盡全力完成三黨聯合內閣之組織工作。」</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿八日電〕民主黨於廿八日上午，及下午，連續召開最高幹部會議，並於同日開秘密議員大會，討論社會黨所提三黨組織聯合內閣之要求。討論結果，意見未能一致，幣原，齋藤，木村，田中，一松等五人之主張，與蘆田，林，長野，矢野等四人趨於對立，前者主張須與自由黨採同一態度，或重新再檢討政策；後者則贊同與社會黨組織聯合內閣。民主黨內之保守，革新兩派陣容，至此已非常顯明。</p>
<p>〔新亞社東京廿八日電〕社曾黨平野力三氏，廿七日下午十時半至自由黨大野幹事長私邸訪問，就民主黨所提之聯合條件問題，探詢大野幹事長之意見，大野當即表示自由黨對於該項條件，無考慮之餘地。</p>
<h3>傳美國務院將接管日韓</h3>
<p>麥帥總部稱或係誤傳</p>
<p>〔合衆社華盛頓廿七日電〕關於美軍所管理之朝鮮與日本，由國務院接管一事，頃據此間人士談稱：韓南美軍佔領區約在七月間將由陸軍部移交國務院；接管日本之期則尙須視朝鮮之情形而定，惟樂觀者認爲至秋間當能實現。</p>
<p>〔合衆社東京廿八日電〕華盛頓方面所傳，在盟國與日本簽訂和約前，管理日本事宜將由陸軍部移交國務院辦理。盟軍總部發言人頃就此事發表意見稱，渠曾聞及此事，但對於在簽訂和約前即有變動一節表示懷疑，蓋任何變動，須得各盟國之同意。盟軍總部對於簽訂和約前變動盟軍總部組織之任何計劃幷無所知。朝鮮·德國·及奧國等之美軍佔領區與日本略有不問，在上述各美軍佔領區內美國之管理爲單方面的，而盟軍總部之管理日本爲國際性的，故此項變動須由遠東委員會之十一國採取行動。因此，關於管理日本事宜之移交一節諒係誤傳云。</p>

<h3>法方條件無法接受　越盟決奮戰到底　胡志明呼籲法人合作爭取和平</h3>
<p>〔路透社西貢廿七日電〕越盟電台昨播發越盟共和國總統胡志明對法國人民之呼籲，乞其協助挽救和平。其言有謂，法國殖民主義者於過去二十月來發動戰爭，法越人民被犧牲者不知凡幾，越盟政府，一本其和平意向曾於四月廿五日向法政府建議停戰，並開始和平談判，不意法方竟提出下列條件：（一）交出越軍武器；（二）法軍在越盟全境各處有行動之自由，（三）一切反對越盟之兵士悉歸法軍司令部指揮。可見法方惑於一時之成就，竟提出不能接受而侮蔑的條件，使兩國人民，無法接近。繼續戰爭之責任，悉在法方。吾人所願者惟和平，並在法國聯邦內獲得統一與獨立，今爲法國黷武之殖民主義者所迫，自當奮戰到底，以待勝利之獲得。希望法蘭西之人民，協助吾人，以挽救法國靑年及越人之生命</p>

<p>〔路透社加爾各答廿七日電〕此間盛傳於六月二日起將發生空前之大塲動，人心惶惶，當局特派飛機在天空散發傳單，以安民心。孟加拉省長布羅斯親自發表安民之廣播演說，回印領袖同時亦聯合發表和平呼籲，該項宣言由甘地。眞納等回盟及國大黨領袖九人簽字，內稱，近日盛傳六月二日即印督以英政府移交印度政權之方案吿知印度領袖之日，將有大暴動發生，以致人心惶惶，英政府之計劃，或不致爲各方面所能接受，故此部或彼部份人士或不能獲得滿意，但無論如何，決不可使用暴力以維法紀。</p>
<h3>印度劃爲三區使成爲自治領</h3>
<p>〔合衆社倫敦廿七日電〕可靠方面頃宣稱：印督蒙巴頓回返任所之後，將提出「三層憲法」，使印度成爲自治領地，由蒙巴頓以總督地位加以統治。回盟難仍表示抵制態度，但衆料蒙督當將根據與英閣所擬定之計劃，進行其事。聞英閣建議計分下述三項：（一）將印度敎各省列爲一區，（二）將本哲布省西北邊省，辛德省及俾魯支斯坦省列爲一區，（三）將孟加拉省與阿桑省列爲一區。上述三區除防務，外交，交通，由中央最高當局執掌外，其他政務均由各區自行治理。衆信蒙督今得英閣之全力支持，當將改變其計劃而推行上述建議，此舉殆將解散現有之臨時政府而復限爲自治領地位。</p>

<h3>徒有學校空名遍覓並無校址　參議員質詢敎育局</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕昨日參議員對工務，公用，衛生，敎育等局提出之質詢，茲分誌於後。</p>
<p>敎育方面：參議員特別注意學潮問題。姜懷素稱，處理學潮應防患於未然，事情旣發生後，可制止者制止，不可制止者亦當有方式，決不能用武力。不妨保護遊行，免與軍警或市民衝突，開會亦不宜阻止，如此則學潮自會平息。渠並述及前在江西遇到學潮及處理經過等。王維駰說：（一）學潮最大原因在對當前政治之不滿，應予同情及諒解，當局勿過度摧殘以固國本。請問敎育局長對學潮如何看法！（二）本會第一次大會決議在一年內籌設女子師範，商業，職業，農業學校，並在郊區設初級中學數所，但一年已過，此項工作敎育局進行了多少？王立本謂：（一）敎育局本身督導工作實須加以糾正，嚴格注意。（二）各校新聘同人薪津何以常較原有同人遲二個月？朱亞揆問：各私校是否遵敎育局命令，對超過收買規定標準者，其費已否全部發還？</p>
<p>國民小學有無計劃</p>
<p>張一渠問：（一）市立國民小學分佈情形，是否有統盤計劃？（二）老閘區爲上海商業中心，納稅最多，但一所國民小學都不設，能否請求當局速辦一所？張中原表示，代表文化美術界要求市府在市中心設一美術館，供同人業餘消遣之用。潘介眉說：敎局對職榮普及敎育是否時時注意其學額情形，有時三四學校即設一班，純係浪費金錢。張學濂謂：時聞本市有徒懸空名之學校，統計表上列有學生，敎員人數，但學校地點却按址並不能找到，這究霓是何情形！孫震春則希望市參議員中有不少身爲學校校長者應以身作則，注意督導。</p>
<p>罷課中學俱已復課</p>
<p>敎育質謁由李副局長熙謀代表因公晋京之顧毓琇局長擇要答覆如次：（一）關於學潮，因開始在大學，敎局無櫂干預。後因牽涉小學，故局方立即召集全市中學校長討論處置辦法，規定如大學生來校宣傳罷課，應採取二辦法對付：（一）和平方式予以拒絕，（二）如無效，則可報吿就近警察分局。此次有麥倫，交通二中學罷課數天，現已復課，目前可稱無一中學罷課者。同時前曾有人利用電話假冒敎局通令中學生罷課，局方聞訊後，即登報聲明絕無此事。</p>
<p>私校收米尚無所聞</p>
<p>（二）私校收費問題，上學期超過規定收費之學校有嶺南，金科，滬江附中等二十所，小學二十一所，均已通令發還，除非係移作添辦圖書儀器，調査屬實後免予追究外，餘均將另行處置。對於參議員稱，傳聞下學期私立中學將收米代費，大學五石，中學三石，小學一石，局方尙無所聞。（三）學術進修費均發還，中學每人可還三萬元，小學每人二萬元，其他質詢均將由書面答覆。</p>
<h3>裝電話要金條可提證據單人三輪車易翻應注意</h3>
<p>關於公用方面之質詢，計有陳培德詢：（一）黄包車改裝爲單人三輪車後，時易發生翻車情事，公用局應注意安全問題，（二）郊區電話，前向當局申請，曾謂不久可以來裝，但何以至今未裝？馬君碩問：市民裝置電話，原爲便利迅速，其自動電話之電流，何以爲電話公司暗中停止？又西區電話通話，常爲接綫生故意留難，公用局可否嚴加督導？趙仰雄亦請增加郊區電話，並代表南市居民，反對將外馬路改建倉庫區。陳伯良謂：（一）裝電話要金條，據本人所確知，裝一只電話要一千萬，分機要二百萬，公用局長如要證據，可以提出，但局方可否嚴加制止？（二）有三輪車行，而無三輪車，亦請嚴究。路式導詢，現本市有若干車輛，早經納捐發照，惟因規定不得移轉，故糾紛迭起，請問爲何不將車照澈底解決，准其自由過戶。朱文德詢：公用事業保證金，以後是否繼續徵收？</p>
<p>失事三輪車都未合標準</p>
<p>其他尙有若千關於公用方面之質詢，經趙曾珏局長分別歸類答覆：（一）公用局對於單人三輪車很注意，黄包車改裝規定標準爲：高二十五吋，寬三十吋，長六十六吋，但據警局報告，出事三輪車，均係未照標準者，故當予以取締。（二）郊區電話因交通部電訊局材料缺少，一時不易多設。（三）公用局對於訓練電話技術人員及電話管理等，已研究一統一方案，經送行政院，但院令暫維現狀，故尙未實行，市府擬於不久再請政院通過，，中區電話通話次數日增，現僅能資成公司增加設備及外綫，正申請外匯中</p>
<p>滬西區缺水添裝水龍頭</p>
<p>（四）里弄路燈屬於公用者，由公用局裝置，屬於私人者，可按弒人管理路燈辦法裝置。（五）滬西一帶缺水，已派工程師調查添設水龍及修理漏水管，棚戶區則僅能裝公用水龍。（六）南市外馬路倉庫區，現尙未計劃。（七）公用事業保證金，乃按中央規定收取。（八）汽車過戶問題，因本市有若干汽車頗屬可疑，爲防止敵產被佔用，故有限制過戶之舉。如能將產權證據提出，即可准予過戶。此事現已與敵僞產業淸理處商議同意，由中央信托局籌劃統一處理。</p>
<p>電話要金條苦未獲證據</p>
<p>（九）裝置電話需要金條，雖聞其事，但苦無證據。希望各位能提出證據，定當予以嚴辦。（十）三輪車有行無車問題，今已決定凡三輪車申請執照，不准由車行代辦，須單獨登記。（十一）南市電燈，自來水時常中斷，由於電量過大，開關損壞所致，現亦在陸續改進中。</p>
<p>公用局長趙曾珏（本報攝）</p>
<p>衛生局長張維（本報攝）</p>
<h3>衛生方面質詢</h3>
<p>衛生方面之質詢：朱亞揆謂：公厠臭氣冲天，骯髒不堪，請衛生局澈底淸除。垃圾問題仍未解決，天時將熱，請特別注意。張中原問：（一）五月十一日報載上海衛生事務所醫師護士將總辭職，請問何故？（二）本市主要衛生業務均另有機關負賣，衛生局工作似甚輕，則可否裁員减省經費？施謙則請將安遠路寄柩所遷移。陸克明謂：醫院管理及督導頗不週到，曾至海格路某院看病，一進門即聞臭氣。</p>
<p>衛生局長張雜答覆：（一）公厠最好澈底廢除賣草紙而由自巴帶紙。公厠應由包商負資，每三月粉刷修理一次，局方時派人調査，以後當再加强管理。（二）安遠路寄柩站，十月底前決令遷移。（三）衛生事務所醫師護士總辭職消息，實係誤傳，事實乃楊樹浦事務所職員十餘人預支薪金過多，發薪時須照扣，被等乃提請辭職，後經准予少扣，即繼續工作。（四）防疫衛生等工作非靠社會廣大力量不可，局方現有工作及人員所應付之事務極多，並無空閒，但對於人員辦事當隨時督導。（五）糞車漏損，因經費少，一時不能全部修畢，現市府已撥款一部，當可在夏天前修竣。</p>
<h3>對路政不滿疑偷工减料　趙局長說出苦衷瀝青貴柏油四倍</h3>
<p>工務方面：施宗德稱，道路破壞極多，工務局修理道路似有「偷工减料」情形。陳培德稱：浦東以及浦東方面若千公路至今未修，浦江大橋由大會決議後亦消息全無。邵永生認爲路政太壞，希望工務局將市民血汗之錢，每一分都能利用。趙仰雄說：公園門票二十元，不如免費開放，潘介眉亦謂修路等均無計劃，且工作遲綏。侯雋人要求疏通新徑港河道，並取締法華鎭侯家宅妨害交通之房屋。陳伯良稱：人民自願修理道路橋樑，工務局竟不准。且據傳聞市民包工便宜，而局方包工反昂貴。</p>
<h3>工務局長逐項答覆</h3>
<p>工務局長趙祖康答覆稱：（一）本市道路年久未修，破壞實太多，且車輛增加，損壞更多，局方人力設備，材料均有限，祇能按步視緩急而辦理。目前祗可對將壞者修理而不及修理已壞者。修路均有計劃，先着手中區，而後郊區以及有電車及公共汽車行駛之路綫。（二）修路工作在晚上亦施行，但目前不在晚上修之原因，爲工人少，設備及經費缺乏。同時修路必須在高溫度下進行，俟天熱後即將再開始。（三）偸工减料實無其事，而係節省材料，因用外國瀝青較栢油貴約四倍，故不得不多用相油。（四）疏通河道，修理浦東大道，設計工作早已完成，均因限於經費，僅能逐漸修理。</p>
<p>工務局長趙祖康（本報攝）</p>
<h3>浦江大橋美願投資</h3>
<p>至建浦江大橋曾據康威氏稱，美國人可能投寳建立高架橋樑，如能成功，或請美貸款五億美元中撥一部給上海，即可着手。（五）公園收贊，已規定中山，中正，黄浦，林森，復興等五園，門票自二十元改爲二百元一張，其餘九公園則全部免費開放。因若千公園有學校相連，開放後損毁太大。（六）新涇港疏河亦因經費關係，未列入預算，旣經提出，可列入下年度預算，法華　侯家宅房屋，係中央造幣廠職員宿會，可派員調査，如確爲佔據公共交通地區，可令拆除。（七）私人修建道路橋樑並未不准，且可由工務局捕助。工務局包工較私人包工昂貴一點亦非事實，如査明後決予撤消。</p>

<h3>響應呼籲和平建國宗敎徒成立大同盟</h3>
<p>集合所有不同性質宗敎之敎徒，以實現和平致力建設爲宗旨之中國宗敎徒和平建國大同盟，昨日在此間宣吿成立，其發起人爲蔣維喬，李玉階，達浦生，徐朗西，丁福保，特松，天慧，唐懷羣，樊崧甫，張恩溥，成靜生，王曉籟等七十餘人當發表宣言，並致電參政會呼籲和平，宣言如下：</p>
<p>宣言</p>
<p>吾人無濃厚之政治興趣，亦不擬在任何時間與環境中，爲個人利益，從　政權之爭。惟遠在抗戰期間，吾人已飽受客觀現實之啓示，深知宗敎家利他精神之有力表現，不能完全超出政治之外。乃開始籌組同盟，以爲團結宗敎力量，促成開明政治之準備。近年國內外局面，已漸趨於險惡，而慘酷無比之內戰，更將毀滅人民，毁滅國家，甚至擴大蔓延，毁滅世界。若不集結各敎系人士，共同呼籲和平，改變此政治上之危險傾向，不僅人類繁榮康樂之遠景，成爲海市蜃樓，即各宗敎之救世目的，亦永遠無由到達。因此吾人組織同盟之理由，實至簡單，一爲迅速有效的爭取和平，一爲合力同心的協助建國。由前者言，吾人必須爲死亡綫上之人民與士兵着想，必須爲饑餓綫上之廣大羣衆着想，必須爲整個人類與世界未來着想，不惜以任何行動與呼號，使戰爭立即停止，即爲此而有犧牲，吾人亦在所不計。目前吾人以焦急而股切之情緒，希望各中間黨派與社會賢達及參政會諸先生，排除一切困難，爲和平繼續努力，不必因交戰雙方之意顧如何，而有所瞻顧。</p>
<p>吾人願盡最大可能</p>
<p>支持此一行動，凡有利於和平之任務，無論如何艱苦，如何危險，如何受人敵視與謗侮，吾人均樂於分担。甚至因事實需要，須向共軍區域呼籲，吾人亦願冒鋒鏑，歷艱阻，慨然一試，即或主持和平人士，不願輕身行遠，吾人亦可單獨爲之，縱有任何横逆，絕不稍存畏避。由後者言，國家經長期苦戰之煎熬，民生已極端凋弊，今後欲從事建設，必須在和平民主之基礎上，團結全國之人力，物力，共同奮鬥。吾人認爲孫中山先生之全部遺敎，仍可領導建國，共軍區域之若千指施，亦頗有進步意義，可供政府參考。而國共兩黨之優秀份子，如能和衷共濟，不使力量對銷，同可作爲建國之骨幹。其他中間黨派，亦皆擁有人才與經騐，倘不用於無謂之紛爭，均可表現優良之成績。</p>
<p>吾人認爲建國問題</p>
<p>不繫於致治一端，政治問題不繫於官吏一途，如能獲一正確領導，則未來之建設責任，人人均可分袒，人人亦均有發揮才能與抱負之機會。吾人以宗敎徒而組織同盟，除此之外，更無其地目的。吾人全係宗敎從，然吾人之宗敎信仰，並不完全一致，故本盟之組成條件，係政治的而非宗敎的。且吾人對於信仰自由，必須保持其莊嚴神聖，絕不强爲異同。是以本盟之盟友，槪以個人身份參加，而不代表團體。但如誤認本盟側重政治而忽略宗敎，則又不然。良以吾人具有一共同瞭解，無論任何宗敎，皆具有利他精神，乃若干不同之中，絕對一致者。基於此，吾人始產生過間政治之動機，始提出和平建國之要求，始確定對政治對經濟對國內外問題之認識「基礎。」基於此，吾人始堅持資本主義與社會主義，美國與蘇聯，國民黨與共產黨，應和平共處，以競賽代鬥爭，而不應鼓勵戰禍，擴大殺機。基於此，吾人始不標榜淸高，自外現實，甘以宗敎家殉道精神，爲人羣而服務，對於可能招考之誹謗與誤解，完全摒諸顧慮之外。　於此，吾人始側重人民與國家之利益，而不以本盟之前途爲先務，吾人可以承認本盟爲政黨，但絕不强調黨性，可以在民主前提下參加選舉，但絕不漠視盟外之賢能，可以因人民之利益而呼號奔走，但絕不斤斤于本盟之私利，本盟之一貫精神在此，本盟與普通政黨不同者亦在此，現本盟</p>
<p>初步組織甫告完成</p>
<p>一切準備，續待努力，吾人絕不願侈陳歷史與力量，尤不願以擁有若干羣衆，向國人誇耀。目前吾人惟一企圖，端在響應各進步團體之和平運動，並接受各方面之支特。謹以最大誠意，向國內政治黨派與一切進步力量，伸出友好合作之手，同心協力，共謀國是，謹此宣言。</p>
<h3>電參政會</h3>
<p>南京參政會邵秘書長並轉主席團及全體參政員公鑒：「本盟組成之日，適逢諸先生集會之時，而貴會之和平提案，亦正係本盟之基本主張，謹以最大誠意，支持此一努力，如中共方面因交通艱阻或其他理由，暫時不擬來京，本盟當秉宗敎精神，及國人之共同願望，前往共軍區域呼籲挽救危機。務析貴會堅持到底，以求永久平和之實現，爲幸。中國宗敎徒和平建國大同盟叩儉。</p>
<h3>推派代表晋京接洽</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕宗敎徒和平建國大同盟成立後，除發表宣言，電致參政會外，並於昨夜派代表晋京，接洽赴中共區呼籲和平事宜。據某發起人告記者，在歐洲宗敎　團體成政黨者甚多，但在我國一單獨宗敎團體，目前力量不足，須合儒釋道耶回五敎爲之。</p>

<p>（五）各地糧商，按照本辦法第二項之規定，向國家行局辦理押款，責由當地糧政主管機關擔保。</p>
<h3>食米來源暢旺市價繼續下挫　高薄粳跌近四十萬關</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕食米因來源日增，各邦路貨不絕，市勢承上日疲態，繼續下跌。昨市場登記到貨共六七四三石，開盤後因市氣不振，各方即存心觀望，納胃呆滯，致交易懈淡，勢呈下降。高薄粳已跌近四十萬關，其他秈米江北尖跌風更甚。白粳南市做四十萬五千元，北市四十一萬元。聞蕪湖和米已停止北運，悉數南下，京地來電，亦有大批秈米二三百艘到貨，是以形勢恐有續跌之勢</p>
<p>粉市配給尙未辦好，消化轉活，頓形上升，回漲萬元。麩皮供求兩稀，市形平疲。豆餅隨各物下挫，再低二三千元。黃豆以油餅俱跌，廠方納胃見懈，猛落萬元。油市實銷冷懈，步削萬元。菉豆節節下降，續小二三千元。苞米去胃有閒散，繼跌三五千元。紅糧跟跌五六千元。生仁來源湧旺，銷場呆木，暴跌二萬餘元。</p>
<p>芝蔴交易寥寥，高定次疲。蠶豆新貨已見，由杭州餘姚來申，尙為初次，新貨品質尙佳，身份八折。各糧暫看下游，粉市雖堅，但新麥在　，亦難立足。</p>
<p>吳開先兼調配主委</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市民食調配委員會之組織，經中央銀行張總裁，國府徐主計長，糧食部龐次長以及吳市長，社會局吳局長等交換意見，並電詢南京張院長繼得同意後，原則業已決定。下設三科四股一室，專任工作人員百餘人，隸屬於社會局，由吳局長開先兼任主任委員。其下三常務委員之人選亦已內定，由市府民政處長張曉松，中央信託局代表任顯羣，及糧食部參事葉寶夫担任。該會成立後，社會局原有之糧食科並不撤銷，今後業務方面工作由委員會負責，行政方面仍歸糧食科主持。該項組織草案及人選，尙待提交明日之市政會議討論。</p>
<p>平價麵粉週內可配</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕關於平價麵粉之配售，市社會局公事，昨已送達麵粉業公會。該公會已定今日與中央信託局接洽領粉手續，本週內大致可配一天。下週起，除週日外，即可經常每日配售。聞中信局已允每月撥配洋粉廿六萬包（每包五十磅），按照議價，每包配價為七萬五千五百元，另售價每包為七萬九千三百元。又聞市社會局方面擬請中信局每月撥配五十萬包，其中廿四萬包，擬直接配售市民食用云。</p>
<p>油配機構決予改善</p>
<p>本市民生食油因榨油業原料不繼，停配已久，現僅中植油廠日配三五〇担，用以調劑，數量旣少，配售商號亦未見普遍。最近經濟部有文至市市，對本市食油，決由中植油廠設法負担半數，為改善配售機構起見，社會局定今日下午三時，召集榨油業第三區榨油工業中植，中食等集議，糧食部已准由中食油廠每月提撥四千担供配。至本市食油調節委員會，以當局擬採取菜子交榨油業代榨代配，但菜子尙未登場，該會成立日期，一再延遲云。</p>
<h3>統債外股平穩</h3>
<p>公債昨更為平和，三六〇室稍售，潤德則進，成交約五百餘萬，統丙晨開一三二〇〇元，低價一二八〇〇元，高價一三七〇〇元，最後在一三五〇〇元左右。雜牌為穩健，結果較前收計甲乙升八百元，統丙微漲三百元，丁戊各漲七百元。</p>
<p>外股亦乏大變，出入零散，形勢徘徊。怡紗晨開六六〇〇〇元，即由廣幫等供給，港申匯亦升，低至六三〇〇〇元。證券幫稍納，而後在六五〇〇〇元左右徘徊。結果較前收計鋼業電話平平，會德豐航業跌半成弱，餘股均告微升。</p>
<h3>華股起伏狹隘市場交易寥落</h3>
<p>華股昨呈盤旋，市況寥落。一部份證券幫逢低有納，疲為屢回，內衣開出曾告跌停，但不久即維持至穩定之局，華豐不支亦然，漸形光明。火柴有銀行幫力納，美亞昨為增資前最後一日交易，兩者都曾迫停，最為生色。美亞綢廠實行增資，今日起現遞均暫停買賣。</p>
<p>晨開時因和平空氣濃厚，均開低盤。遞永紗開後，由二三一號一一號一七九號九四號一五二號二二四號二〇五號一一九號九七號來進，步升至六八〇元，九四號八九號一五七號一八〇號一四號一三〇號賣到六五五〇元。二一三號二二四號一五二號一六〇號九七號進胃忽健，漲到六七三〇元。一五五號二三一號九四號仍售，未能再向前進。火柴雖由一一〇中一信託掛至漲停，遞永紗仍由九四號一五三號二三二號八九號二三一號了結，港申匯回升至十六元外，曾低至六五〇〇元。一五四號一一七號九九號一四二號一四三號來買，美亞二四號等掛漲停，十二時三十分，漲到六八〇〇元。七七號八九號一九〇號三一號一五五號再加脫手，臨收回降至六六〇〇元。一一七號一五二號尙納，收市站六六八〇元左右。收後稍穩，結果較前收計信和微降，永公跌半成，永紗華豐景福新光勤與中法微升，新華漲半成，美亞獨告漲停，內衣跌停後有回，軋低一成。火柴漲達限度，景綸商務新亞國貨麗安自微挫至跌關成不等，餘均微升。遞交計新光永公平平，永紗景福勤興微升，信和漲半成，美亞漲停後的回，尙漲半成強。場外各老股升降俱微。</p>
<h3>各地繭行陸續開秤</h3>
<p>經農兩部蠶絲產銷協導委員會發表消息，根據杭州分會報告，截至二十六日止，各繭行收繭數量，土種鮮繭二萬一千担，改良鮮繭五千担，共合二萬六千担，（按鮮繭折合乾莘重量為一與三之比，）現土種已逐漸減少，而改良種漸已旺盛。浙省一四七家，至今日可全部開秤。前昨兩日各地蠶農售繭殊為踴躍，每行每日平均收得鮮繭一五〇担。繭行秩序尙佳，均能遵守規定章則辦理。而繭鈔亦已由中國農民銀行趕速運赴各地接濟，無虞匱乏。又各地繭質頗佳，較之該會規定之標準綠絲折扣四百廿斤為小，估計改良種平均可在四百斤繅折以內，因此繭價原標準略可提高。蘇省方面除吳江溧陽各繭行，一二日內先行開秤外，其餘無錫武進江陰各地，須在六月二三日方可開秤。至全部繭貨，根據各地產量情形，非準備三千億元恐難敷用云。</p>
<h3>持貨者一致扳俏　廠線市勢見好　人造絲平庸綢貨價疲</h3>
<p>昨市人造絲欲漲無力，終與上日軋平。一二〇號高山有光一千七百二十萬元開盤，綢廠幫略有進意，以致喊價冉冉提升，上午收盤為七百八十萬元，比上日後市大三十萬元。下午終因銀根奇緊，不乏願貶價出售，故最後價喊七百五十萬元賣出。東洋牌子價喊六十萬元，與上日價相同。</p>
<p>昨市廠絲忽呈激昂，因鄉間繭價已經提高，新絲成本又須增加，故持貨者均一致扳俏，昨成交價比上日　漲起一百四十萬元之譜。做開通順買進D字等級十五包，價分二千一百四十萬至六十萬元三檔，中級另担亦有成交，價二千萬至〇五十萬左右，高另担與D字等級價相仿，昨日總共有三十餘包成交。千經去胃仍呆，喊價昨亦帶好五十萬元。</p>
<p>昨市綢貨前市甚疲，後市因絲價見昂，喊價乃又回平。大誠格子華縐開市做三萬〇五百元，最小做二百地，後市五百元有人要進。被面初小十萬元。華錦縐高檔貨一萬三千八百元有成交，盛貨產地雖高，但申市因銀根關係，間有亟欲脫手者，不免貶值出售。且貨身高低參差不一，故市價乏標準。</p>
<h3>布市初疲後稍</h3>
<p>昨日棉布市況初開平靜，去化亦呆。十二磅龍頭細布一度喊低至廿八萬八九千元，四君子嗶嘰廿九萬元。旋因津幫見低進吸中下檔細布，漢口幫對漂布市府亦有納意，市勢遂告挺升。結果十二磅龍頭細布價為廿九萬八千元，比之上日軋升五千元。五福彩球等細布均好四五千元不一，嗶嘰四君子及金蓮妙舞升五·七千元，漂布及色細布藍布斜紋直貢等，亦多見升。</p>
<p>調整貿易政策經委會已擬定具體方案　修正進口管制辦法　恢復收購減免關稅</p>
<p>〔聯合徵信所南京廿八日下午二時電〕全國經濟委員會第一次會議中對調整目前進出口貿易政策，已擬定具體方案。茲探誌如下：對進口方面：（一）撤銷輸入管理委員會修正進口管制辦法。（二）重訂進口貨物類別數量，交由海關負責執行。（三）改訂進口稅則，（一）國內不能製造之工業機械，減免進口稅，（二）國內加工之工業成品推銷國外者，與輸入原料或半製品，酌予減稅。（三）對國內供應不足之民生必需品，征較輕進口稅。（四）進口物品與國內工業有競爭性者，課以重稅。（五）奢侈品寓禁於征，仍課重稅。出口方面：（一）恢復收購政策，將吾國在國外有市場，商人無力出口之特產，由政府收購。（二）出口稅看情形，免除或減免。</p>
<h3>日用品微升　皂燭原料回降</h3>
<p>昨日用品市況，場中同業成交黃祥茂皂五百箱，價為廿五萬五千元，下午做廿六萬元，交易不少，最後牌價為廿六萬一千元，比上日升四千元，固本及箭刀兩牌軋低四千至二千元，光華及美華則升五千元。</p>
<p>火柴市面交易新牌較多，價亦微挺，南京牌火柴每箱為一百七十五萬元，金城一百五十五萬元，玫瑰牌一百八十二萬，比上日軋升二萬至五萬元，老牌鳳凰火柴則小二萬元。</p>
<p>皂燭原料市況，因銀根緊追，洋行家頗有拋售，市場籌碼充斥，人心疲軟。月牌燒碱跌至七百廿五萬元，美貨烧碱亦见回小，每桶七百萬元，泡化碱每磅回降一百元，為二千四百元。椰子油去胃更呆，每桶猛挫五萬元，為一百零五萬元。香草油每磅自一萬五千元跌至一萬二千元，N松香回降三萬元，每聽為六十萬元。白臘回小十萬元，司馬担一百四十萬元。司的令亦自三百五十萬步小至三百二十萬元，軋低三十萬元。</p>
<h3>捲煙後市轉疲</h3>
<p>昨日捲煙市情初開微昂，下午則見疲軟，交易亦呈平淡，各煙喊價均降，十支大英牌煙每箱為六百六十五萬元，比上日降十五萬元，老刀因配貨充沛，軋挫卅三萬元，為五百八十萬元。五華交易獨好，升三萬元，其餘華商各牌捲煙，互有升降。</p>
<h3>本廠呢羢見俏</h3>
<p>外貨定到不易，本廠呢羢見倘，行情連續向上，售價迭創新紀錄。各家大小呢羢廠商，無不營業發達，卜利豐厚。呢羢行號方面，則齊見艱危狀態，洋行因進口管制關係，營業多已暫停，商號除大範圍門莊店舖外，一般普通字號家，無一不感吃本加重，利息高昂之苦，營業前途，隱憂重重。</p>
<h3>輸出品原料進口　辦法即可核定　審核手續歸輸出會辦理</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕輸出推廣委員會執委會某負責人，昨接見記者，據談：此次晉京，曾為輸出品原料之進口辦法，及扶助大宗出口物資辦法，與主管當局有所治商。該兩辦法之核定，大致可無問題，短期內即可公告施行。</p>
<p>關於輸出品原料之進口辦法，業經輸出輸入兩委員會洽議通過。其審核手續，將歸輸出會辦理。至核發許可處辦利。一俟當局命令頒到，即可遵辦。</p>
<p>政府扶助出口商人</p>
<p>關於扶助大宗出口物資辦法，近以若干大宗出口物資，國內外市價不合，再以匯率折合關係，出口將遭虧蝕，各出口商人，咸望政府予以扶助。政府為平衡國際收支，對該項大宗出口物資，當不能坐視不顧，盡可能扶助出口，惟商人能自行出口者則最佳。迄目前為止，已實行扶助出口者，有冰蛋，蠶絲，及茶葉等種，他如桐油豬鬃等，亦在計劃進行中。</p>
<h3>台糖配客減半</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平穩，上落互見。公會劃盤，秘魯砂初為四十一萬九千元，後為四十二萬五千元，回升五千元。台中砂白三十七萬五千元，小五千元，下午回至三十九萬元。二四粗白四十七萬元，升萬元。三半車白仍為四十三萬元，號貨汕提青開二十八萬三千元，升三千元。興化白略鬆，開三十九萬元。興赤三十萬元至二十九萬元，計百數十簍。刁青另星，仍開二十五萬元。及晚，聞台公司消息，決定今日配額，照上期實數減半，僅配四半車白及二〇中砂白二種，預測今日市勢或須稍緊。</p>
<h3>綠茶去化平穩</h3>
<p>炒青·烘青·珠蘭等綠茶，邇來天津營口各地較遜，趨勢益穩，其他花色雖有進出，過程則平定無奇。洋莊茶市仍以吐納談判各不遷就，情況續告沉靜。據業中人云：向受國內外垂青之白琳紅茶，本年度新茶恐不久則將到滬，售價方面受成本高昂之影響，頗有登峯造機氣象。</p>
<h3>六月份配煤額　各機關明日商討</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據經濟部　管會負責人語記者：本區過去所恃之煤斤供給地，主要者有東北，關灤，及台灣三地。茲東北及開灤兩地供煤，咸因時局不靖，交通受阻，而無法運滬。僅恃台灣一地供應，實感不敷分配。再以煤斤價格，久未調整，亦足影響各地煤礦之供應量。現五月份之配煤問題，雖已告一段落，惟六月份之配煤，目前尙乏確切把握。故該會已定於本月卅日下午二時理卅分，召集有關各方面，包括市政府，市公用局，市社會局，警備部，工商輔導處，市商會，工業協會，招商局，濬浦局，滬寗鐵路局，航業公會，後勤司令部，海軍司令部等，共同會商六月份配煤額之調整問題云。</p>
<h3>粗紗略見回升</h3>
<p>昨棉紗市況平穩，良以連日各紗號趁銀抽緊，頗有出籠，兼逢紡建公司開紗十種，致籌碼更見充沛，市場喊價一度下挫。旋以廣幫進取不絕，價告回堅，迨至最後價除十六支紗微呈俏秀外，四二支藍鳳續降五萬元，二十支紗平穩無變化。</p>
<p>〔本報訊〕招商局執信輪，前日自滬駛粵，計長有棉紗二千餘件，疋頭三百八十六件。又香煙六百六十餘箱，雜貨等六千九百餘件運廣東。自忠輪前日秦皇島島返滬，運來大豆九千四百噸。</p>
<h3>美貨出口限期規定六月卅日止</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕六區棉紡公會接棉花進口商臨時委員會主席克隆來函稱：本人頃收到美國棉花運輸公會來電，請將下列情報，轉達各經紀人，曁華籍承買人：「農部再三告誡美商出口人，關於限制裝運出口貨，至遲不得逾越本年六月三十日之規定，法不延展。似此情勢，為遵守部限計，允宜及時於六月底前儘速了結一切款項上事宜，俾出口人得如期裝載，而裝載又至少須有三十日之準備時間。如果結款遲延，影響於裝運時之擁塞，不免庸及農部之懲罰矣。」本件極端重要，應請貴會即轉知各委員會。</p>

<h3>八十萬港幣大騙案　香港永興洋行經理失蹤「打單匪」逐漸銷聲匿跡</h3>
<p>— 香港廿四日航訊　本報特約記者程志政</p>
<p>「打單匪」跋扈一時</p>
<p>香港表現着畸形的繁榮，同時也充滿着欺騙和恐怖。</p>
<p>最鬧得利害的，是滿城風雨的恐嚇信，報紙上幾乎天天載着「打單」的新聞。而「打單」所具名的，又千篇一律的是「海外靑年行動派」。各大旅館，戲院，輪船公司，酒家差不多總接過這一類的「打單」信，金城酒家，陸海通大旅社，得雲茶樓，新世界戲院，「廣東」號輪船都被「海靑派」擲過炸彈，受到了相當的損書，一時大家講到「海靑派」的「行動」，就不免有談虎色變之感。警察當局努力緝捕，落網的已不在少數，單就被捕的「打單」匪洪文鳳而論，他一次便發了四十六封恐嚇信。法官對於他們，不惜嚴刑峻法，最重的，判處十二年苦工監，另外還要笞十二籐。這樣一來，打單匪已漸漸銷聲匿跡，沒有從前那麽有聲有色了一</p>
<p>都市是罪惡的，香港人口日增，謀生不易，所以犯罪的人也格外多。除了上面所說的「打單」匪而外，光怪陸離的騙局，更是指不勝屈。</p>
<p>「聰明人」畢竟糊塗</p>
<p>當十五日下午一時左右，德輔道中最摩登的「懷士門」（Wiseman）餐室，走進了一位廿七八歲的少婦，穿白底橫條長衣，白猄皮高跟鞋，御鑽戒，挾西報，向經理預定西餐一百七十客，說是歡送港督用的，第二天下午六時入席，當時經理看了少婦的氣派，自然十分股勤招待，隨即商定菜單，並自用咖唎鷄飯一盆。吃完，又向經理定燒鴨卅只，大蝦一百七十斤，大火鷄八隻，橙二百個，蘋菓二百個，芒菓一百個，葡萄乾五十磅，經理要求她付定一萬元，她打開手提皮包，拿出五百元的鈔票幾張，表示所帶的數目不够，答應一回兒到銀行去取，經理深信不疑，少婦臨行，帶走燒鷄二只，威士格酒一瓶，三文治半打，啤酒半打，說貨款隨後照付，並因無零錢　車，向經理借了四十元，經理也照借了。豈知少婦一去，杳如黃鶴。經理方知遇騙，結果損失了一百零五元。眞是聞所未聞的趣騙局，「懷士門「譯義為「聰明人」，偏偏這「聰明人」一時竟糊塗起來了！</p>
<p>大騙局　主犯在逃</p>
<p>最近發生的震動全港大騙案，更是駭人聽聞，而被騙的數目，多至八十萬港元。被騙的商行，達二十一家，實在是香港商塲中從來沒有的大編局。主角是永興洋行經理區家學，他的寫字間共有兩處：一在士丹利街十二號，一在皇后行，近月蔴袋貨俏，定貨不易，永興洋行宣傳和印度商人狠有來往，可以接受定貨，陸來的是忠勇國軍之悲壯的扼守！</p>
<p>此次，國軍退出湯陰，安陽城益形孤獨，這種悲慘的情形，正如一個人在患難中失去了唯一的患難同志一樣。狼對於一隻孤獨的羊的兇狠是加倍的，不然，世　和她們訂約的有二十一家商行，所訂的蔴袋，共一百七十二萬六千個，總値四百萬港元，按二成收定，區家學已到手八十萬港元。豈知五月十九日區突然失踨，這個大騙案方才揭曉。商塲上，頓時引起了一陣大騷動。現在警察局已下令通緝區氏歸案。各被害商行成立了一個「永興洋行債權團」，正式進行追訴。據記者調查所得：損失最大的是大集貿易公司，付去定洋十萬元，其餘三萬五萬不等，這綜錯複雜的騙局內慕究竟如何，還是一個謎，但是商人對於定貨，從此便深具戒心了！</p>
<h3>殘酷的狼猛攻孤獨的羊　安陽血淚</h3>
<p>— 鄭州十一日航訊本報記者范世勤</p>
<p>豫省的形勢，國人大都很淸楚：宛不如洛，洛不如彰。宛即南陽，洛即洛陽，彰即彰德，亦即安腸，可知安陽形勢，是如何的險要。「獨眼龍」劉伯誠之蓄意圍攻，已非一日，接着而界上便沒有殘酷二個字了。</p>
<p>從抗戰勝利以後，鐵路被扒路軍扒了，北上返鄕的人民被阻在安陽。嗣後因為生活關係逗留那裏，所以至今還有遠鄕的難民（東北籍也在內）；其他難民都是附近省縣被共軍鬥爭出來的。安陽出來求援的代表說：「要是能有二兩小米一天分給每個難民，我們也就對得起他們了。</p>
<p>在安陽參議會議長的張士驥，副議長王茂生都是深隱二十年，子弟滿豫北的，德高望重的耆老。城圍之後，他們組織了一個綏靖協進會。城裏的人，不分是老是幼，要做工事，大家做工事，城裏的東西，不分是公是私，用得着的，一齊拿出來。他們是艱難共嘗，生死共與，眞是所謂「同舟共濟」。</p>
<p>有名的四十一師師長李鐵頭（即李振淸），與有名的前專員火車頭（即趙質宸），是領導民衆負守城之責。李向着老百姓說：「守城的士兵是把安陽當着　鄉，他們寗願丟了生命，不願丟了這家鄉。」從四月八日被圍以後，安陽還是屹立着，因為有這些壯士在。</p>
<p>孤城死守當然是件悲慘的事，圍攻孤城也是一件悲慘的事。這次，劉伯誠圍攻湯陰的時候，該是知道不忍的地方。一天晚上，共軍一個團長，硬要他的士兵抱着機關槍去衝鋒，那些士兵一次一次衝過去，看到一批一批的老百姓倒下來。那些士兵，看到這個樣子，心有不忍，抱着機關槍，回奔轉頭來，跪在他們的團長前面哀求着：「我們再不能打下去，死的老百姓可太多！」那天晚上，那個團長下令暫停攻擊，第二天早晨在樹林裏發現了一個團長自縊。</p>

<p>出家人也來個呼聲</p>
<p>編者先生：我們是一羣被社會忽視的被壓迫者，因為我們是和尙，所以很少有人注視到我們這一階層，這裏我得要事先聲明，和尙雖說是四大皆空，那不過是一種宗敎的理論，餓了要吃，冷了要穿，這是現實的環境，生存在現實的世界上，就不得不拋開理論來研究目前的現實。我們生在末法的時代，從前的和尙所立的叢林集體淸修的制度，現在已失去了它的作用，尤其在上海，百分之百的寺廟，都是靠應赴經熾佛事來維持的，所以我們這一羣就是替寺廟唸經拜懺的和尙，我們從早上八點鐘到下午四五點鐘，唸得聲嘶力竭，可憐所得的「單資」只有二三千元，在去歲年底，諸山家——（即各寺廟）公債的價目是八千元，那時我們所得的是三千元，到了今年三月，他們還到每衆一萬二千元，我們還是照萬，最近物價暴漲，這些很所得，實在不數日常所需，佛敎會方面，却有一個決議，淸衆的單資按照百分之三十計算，但是各寺廟都不漲價，等于是畫餅充飢，因此我們在萬分失望之下，召集了各家淸衆代表會商了一次，自動的議訂單資為六千元（就是拜一天做拿六千元）在各寺廟住持的封建腦筋中，認為我們大逆不道，竟敢自動訂價，因此有許多寺廟住持竟宣佈，如敢言加「單子」者即「遺單」（和尙的術語即逐出），我們這次所訂單資，在社會普通一般水凖比較起來，可憐已是極低的了，因為我們都是獨身者，當然不能與其他階層相提並論，可是這一點點極低的要求，却還得不到他們的同情。他們接受一堂佛事，可以任意要　主多少多少，再加素素上的收入。我們這點單子，眞如大海之一葉，他們忽略了彼此都是佛子，更忘掉了同舟共濟的古訓，他們只顧自私自利，和怎樣的剝削大衆？假如世界上還有公理，不曉得對於這班佛閥，應該怎樣制裁才對，我們是被壓迫的弱者，金錢，勢力，都不是這班長老的對手，我們惟有訴請社會公正人士，及輿論界與我們同情和援助。（一義和尙）</p>
<h3>皖西茶春插曲</h3>
<p>— 合服十五日訊本報駐皖記者白萍</p>
<p>從六安到麻埠，公路兩邊是秀綠的麥田，車行二十里，麥田少見了，代替的是一叢一叢矮綠的茶樹，望到遠處也是一點一點的茶叢，記者認識了茶區後，意識到面對着遍山遍野的茶叢，也就是面對着茶區裏無數的問題。</p>
<p>皖西山裏，峯　重疊，田地很少，居民們只能「靠山吃山」，種茶不僅是他們的主要副業，且是山地生活的源泉，每一年茶春的好壞，都與他們整個農村經濟有莫大影響，因為他們的生活指望與茶的關係太密切，所以通常就稱他們為茶農。蒙古人以牛羊數字來表示他們的財富，皖西茶農則是以茶叢來決定他們的財富。一個富農，他不僅擁有許多不需花費過多勞力興種的竹園，主要的是有幾塊好的茶山。窮苦的不同了，有山的也是瘦脊的山地，沒有什麼出產，租別人的山，却也大半是荒山，種植的茶還須要拿出一些繳給地主，這原是佃晨的應有義務。</p>
<p>皖西茶農的生活，是瀕臨於饑餓綫上的，他們唯一享受是綠　裏新鮮空氣和無拘束的盡情歌唱。</p>
<p>人歟鳥歟　一段淒凉故事</p>
<p>是每個茶農都能侃侃而談的凄楚故事。</p>
<p>年年遍山茶樹絲茂的時候，有一種尖脆悲凉的鳥聲，廻蕩在夜的山谷中，「楊魁六」，「楊魁六」，茶農們分辨出這稱夜鳥是如此不倦地呼喚着。</p>
<p>據說，說不出是那一年，有個山外老茶客楊魁六，每逢茶春時總要到淠河一帶來辦茶，這年買好了茶以後，裝上木船沿淠而下，不知什麽原因却在湣河裏慘遭減頂了，他的妻子，天天在等候着丈夫歸來，然而，一天，一月，一年，始終盼不到她所想念的丈夫，後來才知道丈夫在許多時候以前已葬身魚腹了，她悲痛極點，不久，就悒鬱而死。但她的靈魂不滅，為着懷想丈夫，便變成一個小鳥，每到茶春飛到茶區裏遍山遍野尋夫，淒凉地呌喊着她丈夫的名字「楊魁六」。茶農們聽久了，就把這種鳥喚作「楊魁六」，於是人名而今却成鳥名，茶農們常常講着這段故事。</p>
<p>這段故事是神話。流傳愈久，便更加神秘了。茶農們每年把「楊魁六」聲音的多少來預卜茶春的好壞，今年「楊魁六」的聲音不算多，茶農們都說今年茶春不過是平平而已。</p>
<p>採茶山歌　是首美麗的詩</p>
<p>「楊魁六」遍山是首美麗的詩　呌喚，映山紅火般的紅的時節，茶春到了，也就是茶農們生活最緊張的時候了。</p>
<p>採茶季節，還是依據一本奮「皇曆」進行的，「穀雨沒得摘，淸明摘不撤」，雨水以前的茶呌做「小茶」，芒種以後的茶呌做「大茶」，「大茶」才是產量最多的時睽。</p>
<p>採茶時，老少的男女，揹着纏監，有的還帶着小木凳，散在矮矮的茶樹邊，兩手動呀動的，茶葉便沙沙地落在擁籃裏，採茶也有技術的，最好的採摘「小茶」每天可能到一斤至一斤半，差的只有半，，採「大茶」時候，因為茶樹已長育究全，葉子也已普遍長好，每天每人可採摘到六七斤。</p>
<p>年靑的男女們，採茶時是比較活躍的，彷彿春天是他（她）們的了，在溫暖的太陽光下，用山歌來解除物質生活的痛苦和工作上的疲倦，他（她）們相互起落唱着，自然有許多歌詞是淫穢的，但有許多却通俗可愛，流露眞性，我們可以說那些山歌是樸實的農民文學，是一首首美麗的詩。</p>
<p>皖西山歌普通多是五句，聽他（她）們唱來，旋律很合於音樂原理，情調是快樂而有感情，記者擇記三首如下：</p>
<p>「眼望乖姐穿翠藍，手裏提個小竹籃，我間乖姐上那去？丈夫又窮家又難，打把苦菜當晚飯」。</p>
<p>「十七十八花一枝，再不榜郞到幾時？月到十五光陰少，人到中年萬事休，水流東海不回頭。」</p>
<p>「蘭草花來嘖鼻香，油菜花來耀眼黃，兩種花來比一比，家花沒有野花香，家郞沒有野郎强」。</p>
<p>還有寫實的山歌，是男女互唱的。</p>
<p>男唱：「小小茶棵矮蹲蹲，手扶茶棵嘆一聲，白日摘茶摘到晚，晚上炒茶到五更，又無盤纏轉回程」。</p>
<p>女唱：「姐呌親哥不要焦，你的盤纏我辦到，簪環首飾由你當，奴家乾茶由你挑，手提畫眉朝家搖」。</p>
<p>從這幾首山歌看來，茶農們生活的困苦以及男女間的愛情，是可想見其程度的。</p>
<p>滿肩擔負　挨度悠長歲月</p>
<p>茶春一開始，茶挨度悠長歲月農們全家的人力都集中在茶的上面，之前，他們必得有所準備，例如搭茶鍋，紮炒茶用的竹絲把子，黃花把子，採茶用的箍籃，賣茶用的布口袋，裝茶烘茶用的茶筐茶籃，到採茶時候，白天在茶園裏不停採摘，晚上炒一下預備明天出售，正如山歌裏說的，「白天摘茶摘到晚，晚上炒茶到五更」，他們是精疲力盡的了。</p>
<p>他們自第一年秋多之季，對於茶的栽培從事中耕除草，移植歸併，剪枝等工作，到第二年春天採摘烘買為止，其間是費了不少勞力的，然而他們勞力換來的代價是饑餓興寒冷，他們終年在窮愁的環境挨過悠長的歲月！</p>
<p>今年茶價，初上市時很上個，每斤二萬四千元，但是因初那是試新，好景不常，不久便慘跌為八千元一斤了，記者到茶區時，正是全國米價開始波動的時候，茶價隨着米價，上檔每斤一萬二三千元雖是茶價有起色，茶農們不比去年好，皖西缺米，茶農們賣了茶即去買米，去年此時，一斤茶葉可以換得一斗四五升米，今年呢，照記者在麻埠時，米已漲到十五六萬元一石，一斤茶價買不到一米，並且，賣茶時是須擔負很重的稅捐的，茶是特產稅中最大的收入之一，譬如立煌縣的預算，差不多全賴於特產稅的支持，茶農出售茶葉一斤，要抽特產稅百分之十，茶行裏又抽行佣百分之三，茶農收入一萬元，實際只得八千七百元，這使茶農擔負不算輕的了，而田賦，徵兵保甲，攤派各項，和其他縣份是同樣的負擔。</p>
<p>有時，茶農還要被茶行剝削的，茶農出賣的總是潮茶，肩挑幾十里山路而到了茶行，又等着錢去員米或布，而且潮茶隔兩天便會霉爛，勢非賣掉不可，這給茶行的機會了，奸刁的茶商看準這一點，故意抑價，是呀，不買得過，不賣却不得過，於是茶農明知吃虧，只有忍痛脫貨求財了！</p>
<p>年年茶貨</p>
<p>憑良心說，政府茶農未獲實惠　不是沒有注意到茶農的，在皖西產茶縣份，每年春季政府都曾派員去發放茶葉貸款，依據合作社社員人數來分配款額，可是，年年茶貸，年年却放到少數人口袋裏去了，這少數就是專在鈔票上考究的茶商們，他們每逢聽到發放茶貸的時候，就胡謅出許多人名來，成了一個合作社，貸款到手，不但不曾用作購茶，且是事去放一利貸，有些茶農反受到他們剝　，政府拿錢原期實惠在農，但效果却是相反的。</p>
<p>今年皖西茶貸總額二億五千萬元，是農行發放的，也許農行知道過去弊端，今年是由農行組織工作隊自己放款，省政府社會處又組織茶葉合作工作隊配合辦理，記者在六安麻埠等地，都曾遇着他們，今年應該可以矯正過往的弊端，記者願為茶農們祝福！</p>

<h3>一本最新的　世界地圖集</h3>
<p>— 沈鋉之</p>
<p>Hammond＇s　New　International　World　Atlas　一九四七年出版　價五萬五千元</p>
<p>哈蒙的新國際世界地圖集是第二次世界大戰以後出版的一本最新的地圖集，它是研究現代地理的人一種不可缺少的工具。</p>
<p>這本地圖集分作三部分，第一部分主要的是三十九幅「世界政治地圖」，除第一幅「世界全圖」以外，其餘是依照洲的次序來分的。（一）北美洲和南美洲，包括加拿大和紐芬蘭，美國，墨西哥，中美各國，西印度羣島，南美北部，南美南部，和南美中部等圖。（二）歐洲，包括英國和愛爾蘭，西班牙和葡萄牙，法國，德國，荷蘭比利時和盧森堡，意大利，瑞士和力喜騰斯坦因，巴爾幹半島，波蘭，奧地利捷克和匈牙利，挪威瑞典芬蘭和丹麥，蘇聯（歐洲部分）等圖。（三）亞洲，包括土耳其叙利亞和黎巴數，巴勒斯坦和外約但，伊朗和伊拉克，阿拉伯，印度錫蘭，緬甸暹羅越南和馬來亞，東印度羣島，中國和日本，蘇聯（亞洲部分），日本和朝鮮，新西蘭，太平洋島嶼等圖。（四）澳洲。（五）非洲，分非洲北部和非洲南部兩圖。</p>
<p>其次是幾樣附帶的東西：（一）第二次世界大戰的後果。這是一篇短短的文章，說明第二次世界大戰後，根據條約或投降條款和其他協定，歐亞非三洲的國家的疆界的變更。（二）世界地名索引，分國名，面積，人口，首都或主要城市，地圖的號數及位置等項。（三）第二次世界大戰的重要地點，分歐洲和北非，亞洲和太平洋兩方面。（四）世界統計，關於世界高山，大河，海洋，大糊的高度，長度和面積的統計。（五）地形和資源分佈圖，指出各洲的地形和重要的礦產和農產品的分佈。</p>
<p>第二部分是「插圖世界地理」，它「描寫世界各國的天然資源，地形特徵，工業，職業和文化背景」，是用文字和照片來說明的，次序和地圖的次序相同，也是以北美洲爲出發點的，不過這裏分類較爲詳細，是以每個國家爲單位的。文字的說明除簡明扼要以外，並無其他特點，但照片插圖很美觀，並且選擇得很好。它使我們看到加拿大諾法，斯科細亞的漁村，墨西哥的西班牙式的教堂，厄瓜多爾提提卡卡湖上的「纖維艇」，法蘭西的中世耙堡壘，芬蘭的雪景，新土耳其的英姿，北非沙漠的景色和澳洲的羊羣。</p>
<p>第三部分是歷史地圖，包括地圖四十五幅，並且加以扼要的說明。這些歷史地圖可供我們閱讀歐洲和美國的一助。它使我們認識近東古代帝國的興起，波斯帝國的廣大的版圖，古希臘羅馬的文化的盛衰。它把我們帶到中世紀的歐洲，使我們目覩蠻族的入侵，十字軍的東征，蒙古帝國的崛起，和歐洲的封建時代。接着我們進了近代，我們看見一四九二年至一六一一年發現美洲的旅行，文藝復興時期的意大利，一五五九年的歐洲，一七六三年的歐洲，波蘭的瓜分，一八一二年的中歐，維也納會議以後至一八三九年的歐洲，意大利的統一，一九一四年的歐洲，一九一九年至一九三八年的歐洲。關於美國部分，也有幾幅圖，這就是美國的誕生，美國領土的擴大，一七七五年至一八六五年美國奴隸制度的分佈，和一八六一年內戰開始時的美國。</p>
<h3>介紹「電世界」</h3>
<p>— 楊實</p>
<p>裘維裕編　科學儀器公司發行</p>
<p>在出版界裏關於一般性的科學刋物不下十多種，但專門討論電學和電機工程的雜誌倒僅有中國電機工程師學會上海分會出版的「電世界」月刋了。電——人類最忠實的一位僕人它多少帶點神秘性，電子的徵小可以使人想不到的小，無綫電的神妙更超乎一般人的想像，它是動力的大源泉，物質的最小質點是原子，但原子內部却仍是不等數的電子在環繞運動，因此這的確是個不折不扣的「電世界」了。</p>
<p>在編排上和取材上，專論和報導並重，謹嚴而通俗，深淺適合於大學理工科的同學，它的「論壇」欄是國內知名的敎授執筆，除了報吿自己研究心得，更重要的把國外的新東西有系統的介紹給國人。在工程上，中國的電機工程比任何部門進步的比較快，各地電工事業也在興起。這本刋物上就有計劃的把國內各處的報導牧集起來供給醉心於科學的學生和靑年。</p>
<p>無綫電的試騐最有趣最輕便，幾根花電綫，幾只眞空管，一二節電池就會併成一架收音機，其他許多小試騐都能啓發人的思考，坩加學習的興趣，因此有「試騐室」來帮忙你如何作這些試騐。「知難行易」用到這方面是最好的例子，試騐容易，它的原理倒是奧妙，也許是無數的數學方程式還解釋不了一個極小的試騐，在「讀者通信」欄裏，便專門有許多敎授來解答讀者自發性的問題，這種由自己提出的問題而獲得解答比課堂上老師講授的効力要來的大。</p>
<p>到現在爲止，用我們自己的文字來寫的理工科的大學用書還少到絕無僅有，有者譯名不同，或者譯的反而深奧不懂，於是理工學院的敎本，參考書乾脆用原文，這在効力上是要打折扣的，而更使一般自修的科學靑年首先在學習工具（文字）上遭到難題。「電世界」除了是用通順的中文講述這些深奧的問題外，還有不少揷圖來帮助了解。的確，這是一本不可多得的電工雜誌。</p>
<p>在有些方面，「電世界」是有缺點的，譬如讀者對象上不防擴大到中學裏去，希望在專論上稍有淺近的文章，爲了使讀者容易看，插岡還得多，趣味性的電工知識也要加多。另外國內外的理工學院的近况，關於電工者也能有系統的介紹，這樣便要更臻完善些了。</p>
<h3>羅斯福的生活與思想</h3>
<p>— 祺</p>
<p>俠平編著活力出版社刊行</p>
<p>羅斯福總統，這一代的偉人，與世長辭已經一年多了，爲他生前深惡痛絕的法西斯，都已一個一個倒下去，爲他生前積極提倡的「世界和平」，「大西洋憲章」，人身的「四大自由」等等，到今天，仍然被全世界愛好和平民主的人們，熱烈地追求着，努力地促其實現，在他死後的一年中，　世界變化萬　，第二次世界大戰雖已結束，然而迷信武力的人，却在憧憬着一個新的世界大戰。世界和平雖已實現了，但是仍然是這地烽火……撫今追者，在今天，我們翻閱一下這人類民主導師的生平，該不是一件沒有意義的事吧！</p>
<p>羅斯福總統出身於望族，從小就受有良好的家庭敎宵，在童年時代就表現出他的公正，坦白，過事勇往直前，始終不怠的精神。他雖則沒有經過困苦的時期，但對於當人却是抱着不信任的態度，而是同情勞苦大衆，在政治範圍以外，他的人格，使得無論是他的朋友和敵人都感到無可庇議。</p>
<p>總統在哈佛大學攻讀時代，就開始對於政治發生了興趣，他在一九一〇年參加了紐約州參議員的競選，次年當選民主黨參議員，以後，他仗着博淵的學問，遠大的眼光，阻大無畏的奮鬥精神，在美國政界一帆風順，一九一二年任紐約州州長，次年就任海軍次長，在第一次世界大戰中，替協約國立下了大功。一九二一年該是羅斯福總統生平最可紀念的日子，他得了小兒麻痺病足足地向病魔搏鬥了三年，終於回復到以前那般模樣，著者在書中這樣寫道：「在普通人的地位，經過了這樣長時期的病痛，一定要抱怨非常，或是精神衰頹了……」（原書六十頁）要是這樣，就必葬送了自己的前途，「但羅斯福却並不如此」。</p>
<p>當他在一九三二年被選爲總統時，那時候的美國正處在經濟極度恐慌的危機中，他終於用他的新政挽救了這個將垂的危局，當其時雖有敵人處處與他爲難，但他究是「個不平常的偉人，憑着獨特的能力，動人的熟忱，倒底戰勝了他的政敵，使反對派不得不對他衷心地表示低頭。羅斯福能够在美國歷史上創被選蟬聯三次總統的記錄決不是偶然的。</p>
<p>本書有三分之一的篇幅，記述羅斯福在第二次世界大戰中，供獻出他最大的力量，促成聯合國方面的一連串的輝煌的勝利的成果，但是遺憾得很，他不幸在最後勝利之前逝世了，美國民衆和聯合國因此失去了這位民主鬥爭的領袖，失去了戰後建立和平和安全的宣揚者。</p>
<p>本書在「羅斯福的性格」一章中，對於他的作風與氣派，有着很好的解釋，每一個想瞭解他學習他的爲人的人，都應該精讀幾遍的。</p>
<p>毫無疑問的，羅斯福總統是一位偉大的政治家，這本書的最後一章，指出他對於近代人類的大供獻，尤其是對於國際安全和戰後各國和平關係偉大的供獻，那是任何人所無可比擬的。</p>
<p>從這本書裏面，我們可以看出這位當代偉人的人格紀錄，生活縮影。羅氏的果毅，勇敢，始終前進的態度，精神，是値得我們學習的；他遺留下來未完成的事業，那又有誰來繼續呢？</p>
<h3>兒童人格之培養</h3>
<p>— 念鴻</p>
<p>萬爾士著　譯文山譯　正中書局印行</p>
<p>兒童教育的重要，自是大衆所深知的事情，所以坊間關於兒童敎育的書籍，雖然不能說多，然而的確有幾本內容很充實的著譯可作爲一般研究兒意心理與兒童敎育工作者的參攷，可是能够給一般父母敎師翻閱的比較實際與不太枯燥的完備書籍，却很少看見。本書縱然仍舊有許多缺點，但是一般的說，還不失爲一本優良的讀物。</p>
<p>與其說這本書是談培養兒童人格母寗廣義地說它是包羅一切兒童敎育法的一本總覽，（除了專門性的智能訓練以外）它對於兒童生理。環境影響。兒童各種特性都有很詳細的闡述，然而也就是爲了太詳細的緣故，本書似乎有些地方覺到太瑣碎一些，尤其是前面幾章關於服飾姿態生理方面的，往往便人讀後不容易產生一個明確的槪念，道是一個敎育理論書籍普遍的缺點，本書遺憾地也有這個小疵。</p>
<p>寫得最好（指最適合給一般父母敎師看的）的二章也就是本書的重點——就是家庭的安適和自立與人格這一段，它把幾點極重要而往往爲普通敎師父母所忽視的特別明確地指出，並且詳細地討論。例如兒童有喜歡和成人軋在一起的習慣，喜歡聽大人們講的做的是什麽，可是一般成人却往往不高興給孩子們知道得太多，在中國的社會上，更可以聽到「大人們在談話，小孩子走開些」的一類話，固然，有許多事情對兒童也許有不良的影響，自然以不給兒童知曉爲是，可是這種舉動往往會養成兒童的心理上的自卑性，使他們在靑年期怕作任何社交活動，這就是所謂一般靑年的過於面嫩不習社交習慣的原因之一。又如很多父母總不肯讓兒童做太多的事情，其實在兒童生理發展得能够勝任的時候，他向父母所求的帮助就漸漸地减少，而父母因爲有了帮助他們的習慣，反愈要帮助他們，有些父母還用湯匙喂三五歲的兒童而不敎他怎樣執筷穿衣洗手，這些就會阻碍了兒童自己照應自己能力的培養和發展。就在兒童自立與家庭的安適這二章裏，羅列了七八十個重要的注意事項，逐項加以討論研究，其中有很多的確是極重要但是極平凡而爲人所忽視的經騐之談，經過著者參以淺易敎育理論的根據，更覺得他所說的現實而確切。</p>
<p>然而本書和著者的另一著作現代父母——相較，無論在譯筆方面，內容的現實方面，似都稍遜一籌，也許是譯者採用直譯和中美國情習慣有異的緣故，有些地方往往看起來不很適合暢達，嚴格地說起來，這也該是一個疵點。</p>
<h3>「我擇取自由」</h3>
<p>— 光簡</p>
<p>（I　Choose　Freedom　V　Kravchenco著）</p>
<p>蘊雯譯（三十六年五月）獨立出版社出版</p>
<p>去年本版曾經介紹過這本書的英文本，我想當時看到過那篇介紹詞的讀者們，一定都希望在最短期間能有一種中文本出而問世，藉使流佈廣泛，人人都有閱讀的機會。</p>
<p>現在這本書的第一個中文本，已由蘊雯先生譯出來了，幷且已由獨立出版社出版了。在美國是風行一時，討論紛紜，在中國至少也是値得重視的罷。</p>
<p>本書是一部充滿了熱情的傳紀。著者維克多葛誠科，是一個忠實純潔的典型人物。他爲了實現「自由平等」加入了共產黨，滿以爲做了共產黨員，就可以報効蘇聯國家，造福多難的人民。但是共產黨的設施是黑暗的；共產黨的統治是冷酷的；共產黨官員們根　漠視人民的利益，而極盡壓榨奴役之能事。他受良心之驅使，於經渦無數次的冷酷的打擊後，終於擺脫了共產黨，做了一名無國籍的遊民。他出奔之前，正担任着蘇聯駐美購辦團副團長的職務，地位可以說相當高，但是由於精神上的苦悶，他那脫離共產黨的決心，究竟沒有動搖。</p>
<p>本書從一九〇五年的大革命叙起，直到第二次世界大戰蘇聯捲入漩過以後爲止。葛誠科把社會主義在蘇聯滲透的始末，忠實地描寫了出來。他暴露了鐵的事實是飢餓，是壓榨，是奴役。「社會主義，說得合適一點。還不如呌强盜主義」。（集體農塲的農夫們所說的話）爲了違背黨的命令而擅敢救濟無數垂斃的小百姓，他竟被淸算了。這是事實，而且據我們所知，他的觀點曾被某些人駡過，事實卻沒有被否認。</p>
<p>我們爲了明瞭蘇聯的實情不可不讀此書。在目前社會不安定，人心極端苦悶時，假使還有願意知道，比較各社會制度的人，尤其不可不讀此書。讀過此書之後，對於現代世界或社會，可以增多一些智識，一些了解。</p>
<p>譯者的譯述很多，這本書是其中之一，譯者在迻譯此書的時候，費了極多的細密工夫，不但每字每句每段都力求符合原意，而且把那字裏行間所流露出來的意思，也都很深刻的表達出來。至於譯筆之流暢，富於文學趣味，猶其餘事。甚盼不滿現實而憬憧另一理想的靑年同好們，都能趕快一讀。</p>
<h3>俄國文學思潮</h3>
<p>— 許培基</p>
<p>米川正夫原著任鈞譯　正中書局出版</p>
<p>在黄昏橙黄色的燈影下，靜靜地讀完了「俄國文學思潮」，我的神思，如穿越了一片充滿着奋花異果的莽原。</p>
<p>雖然我心靈的旅程是忽遽而飄忽；雖然我只能領略到舖陳在外表的花果的整齊行列，但是在愉悅的騰躍之中，所攝取的五色繽紛的莽原的全貌，却永遠地在誘脅着我，要我在從而瞭望着的空際，落向茂密的花果業中，迂迴地深入。</p>
<p>俄國的文學，從感傷主義的時代起，才確立了眞摯的人生態度，一直到普羅塔利亞文學的建立，舊時代文學的意識形態已全部變質，這一段艱苦的歷史旅程的磨鍊，使俄國文學在世界的文壇上佔了一個很高的位置，發出它獨特的光輝。</p>
<p>本書作者，用縝密的筆調從縱的方面指出了文學歷史發展的轍迹，從横的方面簡明而扼要地列舉了照耀着轍迹的文學者的巨星，，他們內蘊的特質和外發的光芒，是何等値得驚奇而歎賞！</p>
<p>全書共分十九章：（一）感傷主義時代（二）浪漫主義時代（三）普希金（四）寫實主義的先驅者（五）雷芒托夫（六）果戈里（七）四十年代，現實主義的勝利（八）屠格湼夫（九）六十年代，農奴解放前後（十）朶斯退益夫斯基（十一）托爾斯太（十二）國民劇之大成（十三）七十年代，從希望到幻滅（十四）八十年代，柴霍夫（十五）九十年代，高爾基（十六）現代派文學（十七）近代詩一瞥（十八）同路人文學（十九）普羅塔利亞文學。在這些章目中我們可以看出作者有時以時代的特質去衡量該時代文學者的成果，有時以一個文學者的巨像代表全時代的風貌，一貫的有秩序的叙述：讀者不難在其中找到「時代」與「文學者」相互影響的綫索。</p>
<p>俄國的文學，留給一般人的印象，都以爲是一種暗澹而憂鬱的文學，一種反抗的，革命精神很濃厚的文學，或是一種宗敎色彩很顯著的文學，而且這些印象好像已變成具體的常識。果然這些原不失爲中肯的觀察，但是都不能把握到俄國文學的眞髓。俄國文學最根本的特質，是一種不甘於只住於文學這另一獨立世界，去固守那觀察和再現人生現象的純藝術的立塲，而要爲着解決實際的人生問題，實際的社會間題以及改善人類的生活，而不斷地作拚命的血淋淋的爭鬥的眞摯能度。用一句簡單的話來槪括，俄國的文學之根本特質，乃是服務社會的精神和社會敎化的傾向。托爾斯太和朶斯退益夫斯基以及其他的許多的俄國文豪，都曾以文學爲社會敎化的方法，努力要想通過文學去建立一種社會的宗敎。這種特質是促進俄國文學思潮演變的一個量有力的因素，在本書中作者對於這一問題有很詳細的論列。</p>
<p>俄國的文學，因爲具有這種根本的特質，所以和西歐的文學相比較，也就呈現出一種完全不同的姿態。在西歐，在文學以外的社會生活上，還存在着各種表現的形式，但是在文化生活方面幾乎沒有傳統的半開化的俄國，却祇有文學才是一種發表思想和表現自我的唯一無二的方法。產生於農奴和地主的國家的文學，其表現的方向作者在序文中指出了下列的幾個特點：</p>
<p>「第一，對於自然的愛好特別來得深刻。第二，叙述的形式單純而樸素，完全沒有浮華，絢爛等等感覺，有時，甚至於還給人謹嚴的印象。第三，那種無饜地浸淫於道德，宗敎的問題而探求其眞理的精神，極端地來得吒盛而且固執……等等。」「這是野蠻人的藝術呢？還是聖人的文學呢？」一位西歐批評家所發出的疑間的呌喊，正好在本書中找到一個適切的解答。</p>
<p>如果說文學是民族或國家的靈魂，或者文學是國家或時代意識形態的且體的反映，那末，流貫在俄國文學中的探求眞理的動力，熱情，眞摯，非妥協性等等，更可以帮助我們更進一步瞭解蹲踞在我國北方的巨人的內在的本質。</p>
<p>我國自新文學運動發生以來，俄國作家的作品，都不斷地被翻譯過來，直接間接地給中國文壇以決定性的影響。</p>
<p>愛好俄國文學的靑年們，零亂地吸取着這些富有滋養的糧食，但都以口味的不能一貫地適調爲苦，那末這本書，正有補足這些缺陷的功用，在還沒有一本有系統地介紹俄國文學史的中國文壇，在貧乏荒寂的中國出版界，這本書確有重讀和推薦的價値。</p>

<h3>紊亂的希臘</h3>
<p>— 夢麟譯</p>
<p>自從三月十二日美國杜羅門總統向國會申請貸款援助希臘後，這一個古老的國家便受到世人的注意。</p>
<p>希臘正是目下歐洲左右兩派勢力公開厮殺的唯一國家，他在去年致聯合國的申訴書中，訴說他三個共產主義的鄰邦—南斯拉夫，阿爾巴尼亞，保加利亞，接濟他北方山地裏的遊擊隊，其實政府或者可以說保皇黨，又何曾不受到外來的援助呢？英國軍駐在他的國境訓練着政府軍，穿着英國製的軍衣，用着英國的軍火，現在又將得到美國的援助，簡直是西班牙內戰第二！</p>
<p>希臘自從一九四四年十月由德人的鐵蹄之下解放出來，國內情境非但沒有變好，反而弄得格外糟了。交通梗阻，經濟幾瀕破產，內亂阻礙了甚至最簡單的建設。監獄裘擠滿了政治犯，農民們無法歸去種田，强者便加入了遊擊隊的活動。</p>
<p>盤據在山地裏的遊擊隊，作戰的人數雖近八千，和他連絡的村民約有一萬五千人，不過政府軍號稱十萬，其實也僅一一萬五千人，且不善於山地戰，軍火又簡陋得可憐。所以雙方都無陣地戰，交戰的人數從未超過四百人。</p>
<p>矛盾得很，共黨在雅典京城設有辦事處，出版機關報。黨內的高級領袖並米被捕入獄，他們對外國記者解釋所以未被捕的理由說，「這樣可以讓希臘政府在國際觀瞻上看來十分民主化。</p>
<p>雖然大部份的希臘人民戰　在屋漏牆穿的破房子裏，多少人沒有大衣，赤着脚在雪地裏行走，但是一般囤積投機者的寳眷們，身上洒着巴黎的香水，足上穿着美國的玻璃絲襪！</p>
<p>一般商人目光短視，不肯投資於生產事業，希臘最近的機器進口單上，沒有一架「車床」的踪跡，但是有一百卅二輛簇新汽車的進口！</p>
<p>通貨膨漲，紙幣充斥，常常有人在街頭撕毁鈔票，不當一回事兒。許多貨物都用金幣標價，連得僕人們都知道將工資兌取金幣。這種硬幣目下希臘國庫已拋售幾枯，市面上也一天少似一天，因爲希臘富翁要保持他們的財產，都盡力的窖藏起來了。</p>
<p>希臘政府弄得焦頭爛額，不得不向美國求助了。</p>
<p>杜魯門的駐希特使鮑德先生語：「我希望援助金移交希政府後需嚴加監督，務使受益者是希臘大部的人民，不是少數的貧官奸商！」（節譯四月五日Post）</p>
<h3>介紹蔣英小姐獨唱會</h3>
<p>— 冬</p>
<p>故軍事專家蔣百里將軍之三女公子蔣英小姐，曾留學西歐十餘年，專攻聲樂的女高音歌唱茲應友好堅邀，定於五月卅一日下午五時一刻，假本市蘭心大戲院，作返國後第一次獨唱演出，蔣小姐在音樂上之造詣及在國外演出之成績言，此次演出，盛况必可預卜</p>
<p>蔣小姐自幼酷愛音樂，於就讀中西女中時，即開始學習鋼琴，一九三六年隨父歐遊，翌年入柏林音樂院，從衛新波因敎授學唱，一九四二年夏畢業後，復從最負盛譽的現代聖曲歌唱家杜亞麗果硏究聖曲，並入蘇里克音樂院從柏瑟魯嘉習樂理。次年又從華格納歌劇專家柯嘉硏究歌劇，並在歐洲各大城市開演奏會，一時英名遠播，爲東方人士，在歐洲音樂界最負盛名之歌唱家。</p>
<p>蔣小姐留歐十餘年，精通英，法，德，意，荷蘭，拉丁語言文字。故能澈悟各國名曲之精髓。當卒業德國國立柏林音樂研究院時，成績評語：「天資卓越音韻與表情均臻神品。」國人能得此榮譽者，殊不多觀。其後，柏林德國大戲院數度禮聘，並與「德勒風旨」留音片公司訂立灌片合同。嗣大戰爆發，乃轉赴瑞士繼續研究「和聲學」。</p>
<p>民卅二年蔣小姐曾在瑞士參加「魯辰」萬國音樂年會，匈牙利聲學名師Jlona　Durigo　所主辦之歌唱比賽，獲得冠軍錦標，爲東方人士得獎第一人，歐洲現代提琴及敎育家（Carl　Flesh）曾在瑞士某敎堂聆蔣小姐唱（Bach）氏之曲，對友人謂：「倘無人吿知此係中國人士，則余必認爲她是吾歡前途不可限量之歌王。」蓋（Bach）氏之曲，及綜合宗敎與哲學兩方面精華而以啻樂表現云。</p>
<p>此次蔣小姐在蘭心戲院作務國後第一次之演唱機會至爲難得，節目計有德，意，奧，法，諸國各曲及歌劇等十六關，由前市政府交響樂團指揮馬果林斯基敎授担任伴奏，料必有一番更佳之成績與國人相見也。</p>

<h3>仕而優則商考—讀史雜記之一</h3>
<p>— 蕭黛</p>
<p>目前一般公務員生活的困苦，固屬盡人皆知的事。但祗要仔細一硏究，那也未必一定凡屬公務員都是窮措大。有辦法而腰繼黄金美鈔的，正大有人在。假借職務上的便利兼做一點生意，在目今的官塲中，已蔚成風氣。儘管政府三令五申，公務員不得兼營商業，但這也僅是一紙公文而已。你不看見權貴們正在開着公司行號，豪門資本正把經濟市塲壓得喘不過氣的情形嗎？</p>
<p>其實，公務員的做生意，遠在春秋戰國時代就有這風氣了。假若以老學究的口吻來說，這也可稱之曰「國萃」。而且那時的人，已經懂得了一套做生意的門檻。他們的門檻是：「樂觀時變；故人棄我取，人取我予」。以及「以物相貿易，腐敗而食之。貨勿留，無敢居貴，論其有餘不足，則知貴賤。貴上極則反賤，賤下極則反貴。貴出如糞土，賤取如珠玉，財幣欲其行如流水。」</p>
<p>這些方法，與目前正在做買賣的公務員的經營手法比較，已太陳舊而趕不上時代了。</p>
<p>一做生意之後，據說即可致富；非但可以治家，而且還能富國。演舉兩個例子來看：</p>
<p>范蠡旣雪會稽之恥，乃喟然而嘆曰：「計然之策七，越用其五而得意。旣已施於國，吾欲用之家。」乃乘扁舟浮於江湖，變名易姓，適齊，爲鴟夷子皮；</p>
<h3>篆刻文字的話</h3>
<p>— 豐重</p>
<p>現在一般人用的圖章，上面的文字，大都稱之爲篆字。普通所用的大都是小篆。其實刻圖章的文字，不必全是小篆，有的用「石文」，就是「大篆」；有的用「金文」，就是鐘鼎文，有的還有用默書的，所以說刻圖章的半是「小篆」，這是不對的。</p>
<p>實在，圖章上的文字，不必一定是「金文」「石文」「小篆」的，而且有些大同小異的，這種篆體，稱之爲「謬篆「，是一種謬誤的篆體。爲什麼要有一些謬誤呢？因爲，印信，是一種私人的簽字符號，爲防人家的私刻，所以有意一些謬誤，作爲一種記號。</p>
<p>文字是一天一天在增多的，儘畫古代的文字因有一部分後世不用而死去但後世還是在學生出來的。所以，要根據古代的篆字而一絲一毫的不錯，以之來刻圖章，那麼，古代無此文字，你又怎樣呢？比方，村莊的「村」字，人們以之用入名字的很多，可是，根據篆體，祗有這一個「邨」字而沒有「村」宇的，所以現在人們名字中的「村」字，圖軍上每用作「邨」字。假使有一個人根據了篆字的形式而另篆一個「村」字，人們用文字學的眼光來看是不免要好笑的，可是，用刻圖章的眼光來看，那是沒有什麼的，我們再以一個「印」字來看，我們不必去替現代的刻字匠作辨，我們且翻一下秦漢古銅印的印譜，便可以至少找到了可十種不同的式樣。中國人是崇拜古人的，古人旣說刻印的文字是「謬篆」，（說文解字的序上就說了）那我們現在又何必要去苛責刻字匠的把字篆得不合理呢？</p>
<p>之陶，爲朱公。朱公以爲陶天下之中，諸侯四通貨物所交易也。乃治產積居，與時逐，而不責於人。……十九年之中，三致千金，再分散與貧交疏昆弟，此所謂富好行其德者也，後年衰老，子孫修業而息之，遂至巨萬。故言富者，皆稱陶朱公。」</p>
<p>「子貢旣學於仲尼，退而仕於衛，廢著　財於曹魯間。七十子之從，賜最爲饒益，原憲不厭糟糠，匿於窮巷，子貢結絤連騎，柬帛之幣，以聘享諸侯。所至，國君無不分庭與之抗禮。夫使孔子揚名於天下者，子貢先後之也。此所謂得勢而益彰者乎！」—（記貨殖列傳）</p>
<p>范蠡積資巨萬，子貢得勢而益彰，這是做生意的好處。祗有原憲那個像小子，才肯匿於窮巷。</p>
<p>考據旣畢，感到無限喜悅，理由是自春秋戰國時代到目前，這幾千年來此風未見衰徵，而更發揚光大，誠盛事也！</p>
<h3>撫恤金</h3>
<p>— 劉夢</p>
<p>二十六日申報「參政會拾零」中有言：「記者出身的陳賡雅，爲抗戰期間殉難同業呼籲，他問爲什麽政府給申報金華亭及朱惺公，張小通，張似旭撫卹金只有三萬塊錢，够什麽用？」</p>
<p>「够什麽用」？不但陳賡雅會問，我的心裏也有同樣的問題。三萬元只買得至多一斗的米，約合一千多字的新五號排工，或者千字一篇文章的稿費，够什麽用？雖說金錢萬惡，但誰又能缺錢？說這三萬元是撫卹金，實在太誇大了一點，不如說是給死者的孤兒買一枝起碼筆和幾張紙的來得恰當些。</p>
<p>死者已矣！即使政府拿出再少的錢，來作爲其「撫卹金」，他們也決不會有什麽異議的。他們的甘冒鋒鏑也決不是企求在死後得到政府的一筆撫卹金，因此撫卹金一項可有可無。遺憾的是政府旣予以撫卹，爲什麽所給予的撫卹金這樣少？如果此項撫卹旨在給忠烈以一種榮譽，那麽一紙獎狀儘能勝任，不必多此一舉了。</p>
<p>抗戰中爲國而犧牲的人，無論在前方後方，不知名的當佔絕大多數，爲安慰死者，激勵來者，管見以爲我們很可取法法國的「無名英維墓」，也建立起一處或數處無名英雄墓；寓褒獎，紀念……的意義於一處，而無遺漏之弊，一若天主敎中紀念無名先聖而有「諸聖節日」然，不亦佳乎？因撫卹金而及此，不知有當否？</p>

<p>法國新聞社巴黎廿三日電：「時代報頃羅丹麥科學家已發明一種愛情測量器，此種測量器，嬌小玲瓏，可放在男子袋內，或女子皮包，其上下有度數，可以測量愛情之深淺。」這是一件聞所未聞的空前新聞，但該電未說明測量所得的度數，是屬於自身的，抑屬於對方的，這不能不算是讀者的一個遺憾。如其是屬於自身的，那倒罷了。假使這種測量器，可以測量對方的愛情的深淺的話，我希望這位科學家大批的製造，不但可以發一筆大財，而且可以减少那般蟻美羊肉，羊肉不羡蟻的痴情者的自殺。男女之間，也不致被那虛僞的愛情所播弄，而墜入煩憐的苦海。</p>

<p>「原來這傢伙也在這裏跌翻了？」祝兆年的心裏這樣想。</p>
<p>他感到有些躊躇。「該不該去招呼他呢？」瞧他那個樣子似乎很窘，不願意再見熟人，自己何必去使他難堪？可是眼見他遭到了意外，弄得這樣狼狽，彼此也算是老朋友，又怎能掉頭不顧，無一言相慰呢？</p>
<p>「老祝，糟透！糟透！我什麼都完了！」徐胖子大槪也知道這樣躱人是沒有意思的，因此反自己先走了過來，一路嘆氣不絕。</p>
<p>今天的徐胖子已經名不符實了，臉色灰白，兩顴內陷，身上所穿的整套的夏威夷衫短褲也染成了一種象徵倒霍的灰色；當他在高喊老祝的時候，老祝眞可以從他的聲音裏，體會到一頭將進宰牛塲的老牛的悲哀。</p>
<p>當時老祝少不得總要請問他何以狼狽至此。</p>
<p>〔倒霉的火，把我所有的東西，連三輛車子一起燒完了！」他倒也爽快，立刻就盡情傾吐：「本來還有先運出的第一批，十天前已經到了獨山，可是我那寳貝太太竟變了心，連人帶貨一起跑了！現在我什麽都完了！什麽都完了……！」</p>
<p>說到這裏，徐紹明的眼淚就像斷綫的珍珠似的直淌下來。</p>
<p>「別這樣傷心！什麽都完了？這也不盡然！至少你還有一個國家！」老祝用手在他肩膀上輕拍着，不自覺地說出了一套徐紹明所絕對不瞭解，而又不愛聽的話語。「國家雖然破爛，總算到今天還沒有亡；祗要國家不亡，憑你老兄這樣的才幹，再發弄幾卡車貨色，還不如易如反掌嗎？」</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Cordially Receives Councillors, Explains Current Situation</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a luncheon at his official residence at 12:30 PM on the 28th for several People's Political Council (PPC) members who are professors. Attendees included Zhang Boling, Xu Deheng, Zhang Lan, Wu Yifang, and others. During the luncheon, the Chairman inquired about their opinions on the student protests and the peace situation. Xu Deheng was the first to speak, stating that the young students are very pure and hoping the government could take this into consideration when handling the student protests. He believed the student protests were related to the peace issue, and he should offer his opinion on the peace issue. The Chairman acknowledged the students' purity but believed they were inevitably being exploited by external forces, and the government should handle the situation reasonably.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet for all PPC members at the Lishi Society at 7:30 PM on the 28th and immediately held an open forum that lasted for approximately an hour. Chairman Chiang first explained the current military, political, and economic situation. In military affairs, the Chairman expressed optimism about the future. Regarding the economy, although there is a sense of crisis, China is based on agriculture, so there will be no economic collapse. Regarding the current student protests, the Chairman stated that the cause of the protests was largely due to the instigation of the Communist Party, who even publicly stated that they would hold large-scale parades on the Communist Party's memorial day of June 2nd, which further proved this. The government should handle those who cause disturbances according to the measures for maintaining public order. Government officials attending tonight's banquet included Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, Chen Qitian, and others. The banquet concluded around 9 PM.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet for all National PPC members at the Lishi Society at 7:30 PM on the 28th. At the end of the banquet, he stood up and gave a speech, explaining the current situation. The main points of the speech are recorded as follows: (1) The PPC has been in session for over a week. The PPC members have been diligently researching methods to stabilize the current situation, showing their concern and responsibility for the country, which is commendable. I believe that if we all work together to promote the spirit of serving the country and the people, we will be able to overcome any danger and difficulty. Moreover, the construction of the Republic of China will be completed soon. (2) Currently, there are indeed many shortcomings in the economic, social, and political aspects of the country that need to be openly examined and reformed. However, the most important thing is to enable the people to distinguish right from wrong and understand their interests. If right and wrong are not clear, and interests are not distinguished, it will be the root of national turmoil. I believe that the greatest hidden worry of the country today lies in the confusion of the concept of right and wrong and the lack of understanding of interests, resulting in the loss of a common goal. Since the councilors began meeting, they have been painstakingly studying how to achieve national peace and unity, and enable the people to live in peace and prosperity. However, I believe that the greatest contribution of the councilors lies in leading the people of the whole country to understand what is right and what is wrong. The place where public right and wrong lie is the place where great benefits and great harms are involved. This is the biggest key to stabilizing the current situation. (3) Today, society is in decline and the people are suffering. Everyone desires peace, and the reasoning is the same. Since the surrender of the enemy, I have personally, for more than a year, been seeking peace through all possible means, enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens. The process by which I sought domestic peace is well known to all of you. What I want to say painfully and frankly today is that if there is still war in the country after eight years of resistance against Japan, it will be a disgrace to the entire country. Any responsible government would not want to use force to solve problems. This is obvious. If the Communist Party still has the slightest sincerity to seek peace, the government is willing to solve it through political means. However, when the Communist Party forces the government to use force to stop destructive and unifying armed actions, some social opinions blame the government for the responsibility of the war, and oppose conscription and grain requisition, without considering what caused this suffering, nor have they heard any cries for the plight of the people in the bandit areas. If right and wrong are not clear in this way, what good will it do to the facts? The so-called peace talks should be bilateral. I can declare that the government's policy of political solution and peaceful unification has never changed. As long as the Communist Party has sincerity and extends its hand, the government welcomes any effective suggestions from your council for preserving the country's vitality and relieving the people's suffering.</p>
<p>The Nature of This Student Protest Is Complex, Hoping All Schools Assist in Eliminating the Trouble</p>
<p>(4) The complexity of this student protest is unprecedented. The Communist Party has a definite plan to intensify military attacks on the front lines and intensify social disruption in various places. Our young students are being used as tools. At first, the Communist Party instigated students to make various excessive demands for their own benefit, and then turned the student protests into opposition to the civil war, conscription, and grain requisition. Clear-sighted people can see the occurrence and evolution of this. It is by no means accidental that they designated June 2nd as the date for a general strike and parade, and called for strikes and boycotts. In fact, June 2nd is the anniversary of the so-called anti-civil war movement launched in Yan'an last year. The government had already learned of this plan. In order to protect the majority of young people from being destroyed by schemers and to maintain social order, it cannot but take preventive measures. Therefore, the National Government promulgated temporary measures to maintain social order. The speech I personally gave clearly told young people not to be poisoned by the Communist Party's trick. Although we have already warned in this way, we still hope that social leaders and school authorities will assist the government in pointing out the true right and wrong, benefits and harms to young students. Young people are the new life of the country. We must cherish them, but we must not be lenient. The ancients said, "leniency breeds evil." We should know that leniency is enough to foster disaster. We cannot indulge and spoil, corrupt the academic atmosphere, sacrifice national laws, and harm social order, especially when the Communist Party is doing its best to incite. The first priority must be to clearly distinguish the Communist rioters in the school from the general students, so that the Communist Party cannot mix in and cause trouble. We have the responsibility to cultivate young people, and we must do everything we can to find ways to prevent unfortunate events from happening. I hope everyone understands the government's painstaking efforts and adopts a consistent and solemn attitude. In particular, the local school authorities must cooperate with the government and jointly take responsibility, so that we can eliminate the trouble before it takes shape. (5) Regarding the military situation, I would also like to give a brief description. Although there is no significant progress on various fronts, the planned plans have been achieved. The soldiers on the front lines are serving the country with loyalty, courage, and unwavering spirit, and will never allow the Communist Party to succeed in its conspiracy to arbitrarily disrupt. Currently, important strongholds in the north and south have been recovered one after another. The national army is closely guarded, monitoring the next step of the Communist army. Until the Communist Party sincerely accepts your council's suggestions for seeking peace and has concrete results, the national army will never relax its efforts to protect the foundation of the country. Then, Lin Hu, Chairman of the PPC Presidium, replied, saying: "Today, I am very grateful to the Chairman for specially inviting us to the banquet despite his busy schedule. Recalling that this council was established during the War of Resistance, it has made contributions to the country and society, all thanks to the Chairman's wise guidance. Now that the country is moving towards democratic construction, the government's support for public opinion organs and respect for public opinion at all levels is very exciting for us. The Chairman's speech just now was sincere and detailed. I hope that the Chairman's wise spirit will inspire all levels of government. Public opinion organs at all levels should work together for the stability and progress of the country."</p>
<h3>The Corruption of Yangtze River Shipping Should Be Improved Quickly</h3>
<p>Temporary Motion in the Review Committee</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] PPC members Liang Jiguang, Chi Zaiqing, and dozens of others, regarding the Yangtze River shipping problem, presented a temporary motion at the PPC plenary review committee on the 28th, which was decided to be submitted for review. The reasons for the case are as follows: "The corruption of Yangtze River shipping is becoming increasingly serious, and effective improvements should be made quickly, and the responsibility for the loss of the Zhongya steamboat and the subsequent handling of the matter should be investigated."</p>
<h3>The "Relief Headquarters" Office Replied to the PPC Yesterday by Telegram</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, This City] After the staff members of the Communist Party stationed at the Executive Headquarters (EH) received a telegram from the PPC a few days ago urging the Communist Party's PPC members to go to Beijing to attend the meeting, they replied to the PPC yesterday morning in the name of the Shanghai Office of the "Relief Headquarters" (RH), stating that the person in charge, Wu Yunfu, had gone to the Communist Party's relief area in Shandong to inspect. The telegram stated: "To the Presidium of the Nanjing PPC and the entire assembly, when your council's telegram arrived in Shanghai, it coincided with Mr. Wu Yunfu's departure from Shanghai to inspect relief work in our area, so he himself did not have time to receive it. However, after checking, there is no connection between the Yantai EH radio station and any Communist radio station in our area, so after Mr. Dong Biwu and others left Beijing, our association's communication and liaison with northern Shaanxi has been completely cut off. We are sorry that we cannot comply with the request to forward the telegram. We hope you will forgive us for our disobedience. We hereby reply by telegram." It is reported that there are three places that maintain contact with the Shandong Communist Party area through the Shanghai EH radio station: Yantai, Huimin, and Shibaishuo. In the past, most of the letters and telegrams from the Communist Party authorities to Shanghai were transmitted through the Shanghai-Yantai line. After the recovery of Yan'an, the transmission time may have been extended, but it should not have been cut off. Therefore, the reason why the Communist Party members staying in Shanghai did not send the PPC's invitation telegram is unknown.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing the Currency Value, Thorough Research on the Exchange Rate, No Changes at Present - Dong Xian Guang Declared at a Press Conference</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, Dong Xian Guang, answered reporters' questions at a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 28th as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What measures will the government take regarding the students' plan to hold a nationwide demonstration on June 2nd?</p>
<p>Answer: The measures for maintaining social order promulgated by the government on May 29th prohibit demonstrations and parades that disrupt social order and harm public safety. The government and school authorities are now making their best efforts to persuade students not to take illegal actions.</p>
<p>Question: Does the government have any plans or intentions to conscript students or others who participate in demonstrations into the army?</p>
<p>Answer: I have not heard of any such plans or intentions by the government.</p>
<p>Question: Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance recently reported to the PPC that the government is considering stabilizing the currency system. Can you tell us the detailed meaning of this statement?</p>
<p>Answer: Since the previous PPC suggested that the government stabilize the currency, the government has been thoroughly studying this issue. There are currently no plans to change the foreign exchange rate.</p>
<p>Question: Please tell us about the recent military situation, especially the military situation in the Northeast. Has the Communist army's threat to Changchun been lifted?</p>
<p>Answer: The battles in the Northeast last week were concentrated around Changchun and Sipingjie. The Communist army mobilized 60,000 people. Its First and Third Divisions began to attack Sipingjie on May 20th. At the same time, the Third Column of the Korean Communist Party and the troops of the First and Second Independent Divisions attacked the Changchun-Sipingjie area, and fierce battles occurred. The First and Third Divisions of the Communist army suffered heavy losses, and the remnants have retreated. The Communist army around Changchun has also retreated, with approximately 3,000 casualties. In addition, another 30,000 Communist troops attempted to seize Yongji, but failed. The 50,000 Communist troops led by Li Hongguang and Yang Jingyu, which are a mixed force of the Chinese Communist Party and the Korean Communist Party, are rampaging in the Meihekou and Weijinhekou areas north of Tonghua in the south. There are no new developments on the Shandong and Shanxi battlefields.</p>
<p>Question: Does the government have concrete measures to suppress the rising rice prices?</p>
<p>Answer: The government is striving for reasonable and stable grain prices, and I explained this on May 7th. These measures are being actively implemented. At present, we are paying particular attention to facilitating the transportation of grain, so that provinces and counties with surplus grain can quickly transport it to important cities. After the Yangtze River water level rises, the difficulties in grain transportation will gradually decrease. In addition to answering reporters' questions, Dong also released two pieces of news: (1) The National Economic Commission held its first meeting in the Executive Yuan yesterday. President Zhang told the 34 committee members present that the commission was the general staff for solving China's economic problems. President Zhang serves as the chairman of the commission and there is no vice-chairman. (2) Yesterday, the Executive Yuan meeting approved the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Review Committee. The Minister of Finance will serve as the chairman of the committee, and the other members will be the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, the Director-General of the National Government Accounting Office, the Minister of Audit, and the Governor of the Central Bank. In the future, the committee will be fully responsible for reviewing foreign exchange.</p>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Regarding the suspension of the Shanghai Wenhui, Xinmin, and Lianhe newspapers, at the Information Bureau's press conference at 4:30 PM on the 28th, a reporter asked about the Information Bureau's attitude. Director Dong replied that the Shanghai Songhu Garrison Headquarters implemented the suspension of the three newspapers based on martial law, and the garrison headquarters has the power to implement this. Regarding the handling of this matter, the Shanghai Police Department has reported to the Ministry of Interior.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Communist Party and Peace Proposals, the PPC Has Completed the Review and Submitted Them to a Special Committee to Formulate Concrete Plans</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The PPC held a plenary review meeting all day on the 28th to discuss the peace issue. The number of PPC members, government officials, and guests attending and listening was greater than in previous meetings, which proves the importance attached to the peace issue by all parties. More than 50 PPC members requested to speak, presenting their personal opinions and methods. As a result, the meeting passed the Presidium's decision to organize a special committee on proposals related to the peace issue to formulate concrete plans. The records of each PPC member's speech were also submitted to the committee. As for the trends of those who spoke at the review committee, some PPC members believed that the Communist Party was arbitrarily rampant in its controlled areas, and the people were suffering terribly. They advocated that the government should issue an order to suppress the rebellion. PPC members from various northern provinces strongly advocated this. Those with more moderate opinions advocated that the General Assembly should appeal for peace to both the government and the Communist Party, and take this peace talk as the final test of the Communist Party's sincerity for peace. Although some people also advocated that there should be no further fighting at present, it seemed difficult to realize their intentions from the atmosphere of the meeting.</p>
<p>The plenary review meeting on the morning of the 28th was chaired by Li Huang. 217 PPC members attended. At 9:25 AM, Li Huang announced the opening of the meeting and immediately explained four points: (1) Proposals will no longer be read one by one to save time. (2) Those who wish to speak should notify the chairman in writing. (3) The speaking time is still limited to five minutes. (4) The proposer's explanation is also limited to five minutes. At this time, there were already many slips requesting to speak on the chairman's stage, and more were added later. However, because many speakers failed to abide by the five-minute limit, although the morning meeting lasted for three hours, only Chen Shaoxian, Liang Shangdong, Sha Yankai, Wang Hansheng, Wu Chunwu, Wang Puhan, Zhou Qianchong, Li Hongwen, Jiang Hengyuan, Du Xunruo, Du Xiyi, Lü Yunzhang, Lu Qian, He Baoren, Huang Yuren, Zhai Canglu, Zhang Jinjian, Hu Qiuyuan, Wang Dongzhen, Yao Yanfen, Chen Yaodong, Xu Deheng, Zhang Yishan, Pan Chaoying, Li Shimao, Pan Lianru, Kong Geng, Jiang Yiping and other 29 people got the opportunity to speak, and the meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>The only common point among the speakers was that they all clarified that peace is an urgent demand of the whole country, and no one opposed it. However, there were two major factions on how to achieve peace: one faction advocated peace talks and seeking peace through peace, and the other faction advocated that there was no need for peace talks and that an order should be directly issued to suppress the rebellion and seek peace through force. The former was divided into two opinions: one was to take this peace talk as the final test of the Communist Party's sincerity for peace, and the other believed that the current situation could no longer continue fighting, and a military solution was impossible, so a political solution should be sought. The most number of people advocated using peace talks as a test of the Communist Party's sincerity. Chen Shaoxian said: The preconditions for peace talks put forward by the government and the Communist Party are far apart. Shortening this distance is the goal of this council today. Therefore, he advocated that the council should invite the Communist Party's PPC members to come to Beijing to attend the meeting and discuss peace strategies with a solemn attitude. Sha Yankai said that to restore peace talks, we should "not settle old scores and not talk about the law" so that the negotiations can proceed smoothly. He advocated "replacing war with elections." Wang Hansheng pointed out the lessons of past failed peace talks and believed that attention should be paid to three issues this time: (1) see if the Communist Party has the determination to achieve peace, (2) the method of peace should be the unification of military orders and the unification of political orders, (3) the steps to carry out peace talks should be stipulated. After describing the atrocities of the Communist army after entering the Northeast, Du Xunruo believed that the Communist army was not satisfied with occupying a certain area. He advocated that if seeking peace through peace could not be achieved, the national strength should be used to help the government suppress the rebellion. Lu Qian agreed with Ye Daoyuan's proposal and supplemented three opinions: (1) The council should maintain a detached position, (2) Publicly negotiate the process and the opinions of both parties, (3) Political and military discussions should be held at the same time. He Baoren said that the Communist Party's sincerity for peace should be given a final test. If the Communist Party still has no sincerity, please ask the government to suppress the rebellion. Huang Yuren doubted the Communist Party's sincerity for peace. He believed that (1) peace is by no means a distribution of spoils, (2) peace should be achieved as soon as possible. The method is to appeal to both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for peace, create a fair opinion, and ask the people of the whole country to hold a fair attitude and let the council send representatives to participate in the peace talks. Hu Qiuyuan explained Wang Xiaolai's proposal, advocating putting forward a detached and active peace plan. This plan should: 1. Both sides cancel the preconditions, 2. Not investigate the past, 3. Respect the facts, acknowledge the facts, 4. Abide by the principles and spirit of the Political Consultative Conference. The party that does not accept the council's plan should bear the responsibility for the war. Chen Yaodong said that both the government and the Communist Party should make concessions on the preconditions and negotiate with a fair attitude. Only success is allowed, and failure is not allowed. Kong Geng's opinion on peace talks was different from others. He advocated that there should be no truce before the negotiations are successful. His reason was that the Communist Party does not keep its promises and cannot be deceived again. Jiang Yiping hoped to correct the Communist Party's style and attitude, so that both sides would not investigate the past and discuss fair and reasonable methods to seek a solution. Xu Deheng was the most vocal advocate that a military solution should not be used and that peace talks must be restored. He believed that "fighting on is unacceptable," "fighting for ten or twenty years will still require peace," and that the lives of the people in the North are extremely difficult and should not continue to fight. He said that the PPC is an organization that united to resist Japan, and after the war, there is an opportunity for peace and unity. Political problems should be solved in a political way. He also raised the impropriety of the student protests, the suspension of the three newspapers in Shanghai, and the temporary measures to maintain social order. Jiang Hengyuan believed that it was impossible to solve the Communist Party problem in three to five months, so the council should send representatives to discuss with the Communist Party, and then form groups such as the Peace Promotion Association to discuss the solution. Jiang said: If this problem is solved, the student protests can also be quelled. As for those who advocated that there was no need for peace talks and that an order should be directly issued to suppress the rebellion, there were also many of them. Liang Shangdong said that most people currently hope for peace, which is the hope that the government will send troops to defeat the Communist Party in order to achieve peace. He sacrificed his right arm during the War of Resistance and is now willing to sacrifice his left arm in the suppression of the Communist Party. Wu Chunwu believed that both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have exclusiveness, and it is predetermined that they cannot stop the war and make peace. Only the government can be asked to issue an order to suppress the rebellion. Wang Puhan also believed that "there can be no peace," and the Communist Party's PPC members would never attend the General Assembly. The responsibility is clear, and the human and material resources of the whole country should be concentrated to use force to achieve peace. Li Hongwen represented the opinions of the people in the North and opposed the ineffective truce to avoid suffering losses again. Zhai Canglu also advocated immediate suppression. However, he said: The military discipline of the troops suppressing the Communist Party should be paid attention to by the military officers. Li Shimao firmly advocated achieving the goal of peace through military action. In addition, some people also advocated launching a peace movement in the Communist Party area. For example, Huang Yuren pointed out that if a peace movement is launched in the government area through strikes and class boycotts, the Communist Party area will concentrate all its strength to attack the national army, which is very unfair. Fan Chaoying's opinion was the most novel in the morning meeting. He explained that the terms "civil war" and "internal turmoil" are both inappropriate. He believed that today's war is a war instigated by a third country. Therefore, the solution should start from the international and diplomatic aspects, and the true meaning of this war should be declared so that people all over the world can understand peace before there is a solution.</p>
<h3>The Review Committee Continues Meeting: Councilors Enthusiastically Speak, Seeking Paths to Peace, Each with Their Own Proposals</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The full council review committee continued its meeting on the 28th afternoon. Chairman Jiang Yong presided, from 3:30 PM to 7:15 PM. Councilors continued to express their opinions on peace. A total of 34 people spoke, including Bao Yimin, Yan Shutang, Lin Hu, Yin Shuxian, Wu Wangji, Zhou Qianchong, Chu Fucheng, Huang Yanpei, He Jihong, Cheng Ximeng, Wang Zaoshi, and Jin Zhenyu. The majority advocated that if seeking peace fails, the government should immediately issue a decree to suppress the Communists. For a time, the meeting place was filled with calls for suppression.</p>
<p>Their reasons were that wherever the Communist army went, they burned, killed, looted, and seized, the people could not bear their lives, and were in extreme suffering. The Communist army had no intention of peace, only engaging in fighting interspersed with negotiations, which only increased the people's deeper suffering. Therefore, they advocated that the government immediately issue a decree to suppress them. Secondly, some advocated for peace with a price. Others advocated sending personnel to the Communist-held areas to solicit opinions. If the Communists proposed conditions without sincerity for peace, then they should resolve to suppress them. Generally speaking, all felt that fighting interspersed with negotiations caused too much suffering for the people, and a definite strategy must be determined to seek a permanent solution. Another part believed that the opinions of the people should be respected, and the decision on war or peace should be based on them. Wang Zaoshi proposed stopping the civil war, believing that all parties in the country should bear responsibility for the civil war. If the civil war were to continue, it would affect the international war, so a ceasefire should be enacted immediately, and the ceasefire must be sincere. Wang had three methods for conducting peace talks: (1) Both sides immediately and simultaneously implement a comprehensive ceasefire in place; (2) A national peace conference could be convened; (3) This council should elect councilors from various parties to organize a peace promotion association.</p>
<p>Zhou Qianchong proposed that political disputes should be resolved with political wisdom. Zhou said that the key to the peace issue lies in determination. If the people have the determination to seek peace, then peace can be achieved. At the same time, he believed that China's problems should be resolved in China, in Nanjing. Currently, it is a tug-of-war war, "pulling back and forth, the people's heads are being pulled off." Huang Yanpei loudly exclaimed that peace is a must. Not only are the common people suffering now, but they will suffer even more in the future. Huang believed that the present is a critical juncture for the life and death of the country and the people, and we must come up with a proper solution to resolve it. Chu Fucheng then emphasized and explained Shao Congen's peace proposal, with his opinions being: (1) The assembly should pass a resolution calling on the government and the Chinese Communist Party to seek peace, and organize a peace promotion committee; (2) Both sides should abolish any conditions for peace talks and immediately cease military conflicts throughout the country; (3) The Peace Promotion Committee should provide opinions based on a national standpoint to ensure that true peace is realized as soon as possible. Wang Bao-xuan pointed out that peace should be sincere and should not put on a compassionate face, hypocritically proposing peace. It should be clear who does not want peace and be cautious about the object of peace. Wang said: "Those with political power must want peace; those without political power do not need peace. The Communist Party has already negated the government. We are councilors hired by the government negated by the Communist Party, and have no status in the eyes of the Communist Party. Yet we are talking highly about peace. Who will be the target?" Wang then commented on the student movement proposed by Xu Deheng and the three newspapers in Shanghai, saying: "Are we going to target the three newspapers and the students? Do the three newspapers and the students represent the Communist Party?" Finally, he said: "Seeking peace with peace was tried last year and proved unsuccessful. Seeking peace with war is not yet hopeless. The reason it has not been successful is due to some shortcomings. We should ask the government to eliminate corruption and concentrate all efforts to seek true peace."</p>
<p>Liu Jing, Bao Yimin, Cui Zhenhua, Wu Shipeng, Li Rulang, Wang Huamin, Zhang Bangzhen, and others all recounted the suffering of the people and unanimously requested suppression. Yan Shutang exclaimed: "I don't want peace talks. I can't bear to hear peace talks. I hate peace talks!" Zhang Deng said that peace is for three parties: (1) the government, (2) the Communist Party, and (3) the Soviet Union. Currently, we are only asking for peace from one-third of the parties, the government. How can it succeed? Wang Zemin believed that there were several prerequisites: First, both sides must cease fire unconditionally; Second, if this cannot be done, the people's organizations from both sides should jointly form a people's arbitration committee to decide. The opinions of both sides on peace can be submitted to the arbitration committee; (4) If one side cannot accept the opinion, it can be known which side is rejecting the people, and the people on both sides can jointly condemn it. Others still believed that the council should be a mediator. However, in the afternoon meeting, calls for suppression outnumbered calls for peace.</p>

<h3>Random Notes from the Political Consultative Conference</h3>
<p>— Our Correspondent, Yu Zhenji</p>
<p>The full review session of the council on the 28th had 217 councilors in attendance, making it the liveliest day since the meetings began. President Sun Ke, President Yu Youren, and Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng also attended and listened in, filling the seats on the officials' platform. This proves the degree to which all parties are concerned about peace.</p>
<p>The meeting place was full of speeches. Ye Daoyuan stood up to remind the chairman that continuing the discussion in this way would not yield results. Chairman Li Huang replied that the presidium had discussed this matter beforehand. After all parties had spoken to a considerable extent, the presidium would have a way to handle it.</p>
<p>The lyricist Lu Zhi dropped a lot of book knowledge on the podium, shouting, "Fight, talk, fight, talk, fight, talk, rise, fall, rise, fall, rise, fall." If this continues, the common people can't bear it!</p>
<p>Huang Yuren, the "big gun," was the most prominent figure in the meeting on the 28th. Before speaking, he handed a note to the chairman, roughly requesting an extension of his speaking time. In fact, he spoke for at least ten minutes that day, earning applause five or six times. His witty remark, "In today's situation, the people cannot bear their lives, and the officials are not connected to their livelihoods," he said that peace is not a division of spoils, not a piece for the Kuomintang, a piece for the Communist Party, a piece for the MinShe Party, and a piece for the Youth Party. If that were the case, wouldn't it become a "fried eight pieces"!</p>
<p>Female councilor Wang Dongzhen reported two strange tortures used by the Communist Party, one called "going to the rooftop" and the other called "anti-aircraft gun." Lu Yunzhang also told a story. In this type of council meeting, many female councilors tell stories, and they all tell them very vividly.</p>
<p>Hu Shi gestured wildly on the stage talking about peace. His wife was supervising him in the audience. After Hu finished speaking and returned to his seat, his wife also left, as if she had come specifically to support her husband.</p>
<p>Chen Yaodong spoke at length about the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, saying, "The general trend of the world, after a long period of division, it must unite; after a long period of unity, it must divide; after a long period of peace, there will be war; after a long period of war, there will be peace." He also said that he himself had a lot of experience in persuading couples to stop arguing. As long as there is sincerity, no quarrel cannot be resolved.</p>
<p>The old gentleman Kong Geng took the stage to perform again today. Halfway through his speech, the time was up, and the chairman rang the bell. He turned around to argue and criticized, saying that in history, only Qin Hui talked about peace. Those who have been fooled by the Communist Party do not talk about peace. He himself is an example.</p>
<p>Jiang Yiping is worthy of being a famous lawyer. He pointed out that Councilor Xu Deheng had exceeded his speaking time. The chairman repeatedly rang the bell, and the audience repeatedly applauded, urging him to come down, but he ignored them. Not talking about the rule of law and talking about democracy is empty talk. The tug-of-war style peace talks are ruining the common people.</p>
<p>Almost none of the 29 councilors who spoke this morning did not exceed five minutes. They turned a deaf ear to the ringing of the bell on the stage, and the chairman's attempts to stop them were ineffective. The peace issue is too important, who wouldn't want to say a few more words! (Combined)</p>
<p>In the afternoon meeting, the first few speakers were all female councilors. According to statistics, none of the seven or eight female councilors who spoke did not advocate for suppressing the rebellion. In particular, several female councilors from the Northeast spoke vehemently. Councilor Fan Yongshu from Yunnan spoke with humor. He said, "Now peace talks are empty talk. Precisely because they are empty talk, I will not talk about them." Zhang Bangzhen said: "Peace, peace, how many evils are carried out in your name."</p>
<p>Youth Party councilor Zhou Qianchong gave an example. He said: "An American reporter who went from China to Japan said that his impression of the two countries was like going from a chaotic world to a silent paradise." Japan is moving towards the road to recovery, and we should be vigilant. After Zhou finished speaking, someone said that they discovered that Zhou was speaking for the second time. Kong Geng immediately protested to the chairman, saying: "If a person can speak twice, I want to speak again." However, this issue did not cause a stir, because Zhou Qianchong's second speech had special reasons, and the presidium could not help but give him some understanding.</p>
<p>Wang Zaoshi said that it is wrong to sit on a sofa and talk about whether to fight or not.</p>
<p>Fei Xuezhang talked at length about Marx on the podium, concluding that "Marx is the most shameless thing." Liao was describing how the wife of a Soviet person was a Communist, how, how, how. The bell on the chairman's platform rang loudly. Liao did not wait to finish speaking and said that the time was up and he would not speak anymore. The situation was quite comical, and the whole crowd roared with laughter.</p>
<p>Wu Wangji hoped that those who advocate for peace would quickly go to the Communist-held areas to appeal. When he spoke, he shouted loudly, and was the loudest of the councilors.</p>
<h3>The Full Review Committee of the Political Consultative Conference Passes the List of Special Committees, totaling 45 people, including Ye Daoyuan</h3>

<h3>The Northeast National Army Recovers Faku: Fierce Battle at Siping Throughout the Night, the Communist Army Retreats; Two Routes of Communist Army in Eastern Hebei Attack Shijimenzhai</h3>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 28th] Faku was lost and recovered on the 27th, and the threat to Tieling has been reduced. Xi'an and Xifeng are both stable. In addition, the Communist army attacked Changtu on the night of the 28th and shelled Shizhan, with fierce fighting throughout the night. At dawn, they harassed Mazhonghe and other stations again to the south, threatening Kaiyuan. By noon, the Communist army was repelled. The Communist army besieging Siping Street numbered no less than 70,000. On the night of the 27th, they approached the city again, with fierce fighting throughout the night. On the morning of the 28th, they retreated to a slightly more distant place. Army Commander Chen Mingren said that Siping is safe.</p>
<p>[United Press, Beiping, 28th] Military authorities in Siping Street issued a curfew order on the 28th and arrested 180 suspected spies, one of whom has been executed. The spy who was executed was a Taoist priest who climbed onto a chimney and sent attack signals to the Communist army, after which the Communist artillery shelled the city of Siping Street.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 28th] Dong Yingbin, Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, flew to Beiping by plane in the rain on the morning of the 28th and returned to Shenyang at dusk. It is said that he was sent to confer with Director Li Zongren on military matters.</p>
<p>[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 28th] The Communist army south of Pulandian has been gathering in Zhuanghe in recent days. In addition to the approximately 2,000 who bypassed Wafangdian some days ago, there are more than 3,000 who have bypassed from other routes. It is judged that there are two reasons: (1) to harass the Andong area, and (2) to contain the National Army's forces.</p>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The fighting northeast of Tangshan in Eastern Hebei is still ongoing. It is said that the remnants of Li Yunchang's Communist army fled east from the border of Rehe to Caoying and Yiyuan Pass west of Linyu. At the moment, a part of the Communist army on the outskirts of Beidaihe has moved north. After the two routes of the Communist army converged, they fiercely attacked Shijimenzhai (thirty or forty miles north of Linyu) yesterday. The fighting at the Great Wall Coal Mine is intense. Another part of the Communist army once attacked Libatun on the periphery of Tangshan. The Communist army is also gathering near the Lingkai Mine, attempting to harass.</p>
<p>[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 28th] The Communist army is active on the outskirts of Tianjin.

<h3>The Distribution and Organization of Korean Communist Army in Northeast, Totaling Approximately 30,000</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 28th] As the Communist army in northern Songhua River forgets the painful lessons learned from several past invasions of the Jilin-Changchun area, and once again throws its entire force south across the river, the reporter hereby synthesizes information from various sources to introduce the distribution and organization of the Korean Communist army in the Northeast, which is driven by the Communist army's "use of foreign races" policy and makes futile sacrifices. The leader of the Korean Communist army in the Northeast, Jiang Xintai, is a powerful member of the "International Faction." He served as a captain in the Soviet Red Army. When the Japanese surrendered on August 15th, he entered the Northeast with the Soviet army. He is currently the commander of the Jilin-Eastern Military District. In addition to controlling the security regiments of Wangqing, Helong, Hunchun, Dunhua, and Yanji, five counties in eastern Jilin (totaling approximately 2,500 people), he also commands the Independent Division, the Independent Second Division, and the Li Hongguang Detachment (equivalent to a division's strength), the main force of the Korean Communists in eastern Jilin. The total strength of these three divisions is approximately 17,000 people. Jiang himself serves as the commander, occupying the Jinchuan and Huinan areas in the northern part of Andong Province and the eastern part of Jilin Province, in a state of confrontation with the National Army stationed in Hailong, Panshi, and Huadian, and taking advantage of opportunities to harass the National Army's defense areas, looting, burning, and killing. In this group of Korean Communists, in addition to the soldiers and some cadres being Korean, the senior cadres and deputy division commanders are all members of the Chinese Communist Party. It has been learned that the commander of the Independent Second Division is Liu Dongyuan, and the leader of the Li Hongguang Detachment is Wang Guang. Wang is the deceased leader of the Korean anti-Japanese movement in the Northeast. The Chinese Communist Party uses his reputation among Koreans, borrowing the name of the team. In addition, the Communist army's Jilin-Eastern Military District also has a Korean artillery regiment of approximately 500 people, which assisted the Communist army in capturing Changchun in "April 14th" last year. In addition, there are the Chinese-Korean mixed First and Second Divisions, stationed in Dunhua and Hada respectively. The strength of the two divisions is 15,000 people, of which Koreans account for approximately one-third. In total, the Korean Communist forces above, the Jilin-Eastern Military District has approximately 22,000 people, and approximately 10,000 others are scattered in various places in Harbin. They have also assisted the Communist army in invading Jilin and the southern end of the Ji-Hai Railway. However, according to qualified Koreans in Changchun, nearly 70% of the Korean Communist army are forced to participate, and more than 20% are looking for food and clothing by joining the army because they have no means of living.</p>
<h3>Traffic on the Ping-Cheng Section is Restored: The Battle for Longhua is Fierce</h3>
<p>[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The National Army in Chengde swept along the railway towards Pingquan, successively capturing Sangou, Liugou. Traffic on the Ping-Cheng section was restored yesterday. The main force of the Communist army in Shangbancheng southeast of Chengde has retreated to Xiabancheng.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Chengde, 28th] One-third of the urban area of Longhua has fallen into the hands of the Communist army, while two-thirds and the highlands in the suburbs are still firmly defended by the National Army. The battle situation is increasingly fierce. Seven reconnaissance and fighter aircraft passed by here at noon on the 27th, flying to Longhua. It is said that Fu Zuoyi's troops supporting Rehe have advanced east from Dushikou.</p>
<h3>The Communist Army Devises Various Pretexts to Seek Money Before Taking Lives</h3>
<p>The So-Called Account-Settling Murder is Very Cruel</p>
<p>[Our GuiSui Dispatch, 27th] The Communist army has innovated its tricks. Recently, in the Yanbei area, following the settlement of accounts, they have implemented the so-called clearing of accounts, that is, killing those who have been settled with to eliminate all traces, which is a retaliatory act against the returning home team. The method of clearing accounts is to drag those who have been settled with to the ground, dragging them until their brains rupture, their whole bodies are fractured, and they die.</p>
<h3>Famous Historian Qiao Xun Tragically Murdered by the Communist Army</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th] The famous historian Qiao Xun was tragically killed after the fall of Hejin due to the Communist army's clearing of blood debts. Qiao, whose style name was Shengyu, was seventy years old. Before the War of Resistance, he taught at Jin University and other schools, specializing in history. After the War of Resistance, he retired to his hometown. The Japanese threatened him several times, but he refused to take any puppet position.</p>
<h3>People in Harbin Flee in Large Numbers: The Communist Party Sets June 1st to Implement General Mobilization; Men Will Be Forcibly Conscripted to the Front Lines</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Changchun, 28th] Harbin is now experiencing a phenomenon of famine flight that has not occurred since it was occupied by the Communist army for more than a year. According to statistics from the Changchun Municipal Government, in the past five days, the number of refugees fleeing from Harbin to Changchun has reached more than 3,000. In addition to escaping the famine that is prevalent in the Communist-held areas, they also want to escape the "manpower shortage" caused by the Communist Party's continuous military defeats. On June 1st, Harbin City will implement a general mobilization order, and men will be forcibly conscripted to the front lines, either as soldiers, or as stretcher bearers, or to drive carts to transport supplies. Even the old and weak cannot be exempted unless absolutely necessary. This is what refugees who fled from Harbin to Changchun told reporters. What is particularly noteworthy is that among the thousands of refugees who fled to Changchun, most are old, weak, women, and children. Given the strict security in the Communist-held areas, how can they allow so many refugees to pass through checkpoints and flee? According to refugees who fled to Changchun, at present, inflation is rampant and prices are high in the Communist-held areas. As a result of thoroughly requisitioning grain in recent years, not only is spring plowing impossible, but it has also led to a famine. Therefore, the people, threatened by the famine and various terror policies, all want to flee to the recovered areas. In order to alleviate the serious famine caused by the lack of food, the Communist army has clearly imposed restrictions, but tacitly allows those so-called stubborn elements to leave the Communist area. Anyone who wants to move out of the Communist area only needs to pay a deposit of 20,000 yuan and find two shops to guarantee them, and they can be released. It is said that the Changchun Municipal Authorities are currently trying to provide relief to these refugees.</p>

<p>Wuxing</p>

<h3>Post-War Canadian Aid to China Reaches Over 70 Million US Dollars</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Montreal, 27th Dispatch] According to Canadian sources: Since the end of the war, Canadian financial aid to China has totaled US$72.75 million. Under the wartime "Mutual Aid" plan, Canada granted China US$39.75 million between 1943 and 1946, most of which was spent on wartime munitions and supplies, as well as industrial equipment. Under the first post-war loan agreement between China and Canada in February 1946, China received US$60 million, of which US$25 million was allocated for the purchase of Canadian supplies and equipment. Repayment is made through the issuance of Chinese government bonds, with an annual interest rate of 3%, maturing 30 years after 1948.

<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 28th Dispatch] Rice prices here are stable. High-quality rice is 300,000, medium-quality rice is 280,000, and there is still a downward trend.</p>
<p>Hangzhou [Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 28th Dispatch] Rice prices in Hangzhou have risen sharply again in recent days. Coarse rice is 340,000, and first- and second-grade rice are unavailable. According to informed sources, the main reason is the scarcity of supply from the producing areas. The rice-producing areas of Zhejiang Province are adjacent to the silkworm-raising areas. Silkworm farmers have recently purchased 300,000 dan from the government at a price of one million per dan. Most of this huge sum was used to purchase rice, creating the phenomenon of scarce supply.</p>

Our company has not shipped pig iron to Japan. The aforementioned news is clearly inconsistent with the facts. We are writing to request verification and correction." We respectfully request correction! Central News Agency</p>
<h3>Yu Hongjun's Financial Report (Continued and Concluded)</h3>
<p>Improving Local Finances: Last year, the government, considering it necessary to change the financial revenue and expenditure system for national construction, revised the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law, dividing the national finance into three levels: central, provincial (municipal), and county (municipal bureau). The allocation of tax sources for all levels of government was also readjusted. Now, we will first review the system aspect. Since the implementation of the revised Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law, there have been both advantages and disadvantages in the local finance system. Advantages: 1. The new system divides national finance into three levels, with a clear system, and has a somewhat equitable financial form, which is very beneficial for the implementation of constitutional government and the promotion of local autonomy. 2. The provincial finance has restored its independent status, allowing it to gradually seek self-sufficiency to promote provincial autonomy. 3. County finance is more abundant than before. In addition to the original five autonomous taxes, it also receives 50% of the land tax (including agricultural tax), 50% of the business tax, 30% of the inheritance tax, and all of the deed tax, and can legally levy special taxes tailored to local conditions to make up for the budget, thereby consolidating the foundation of grassroots autonomy. Disadvantages: 1. The allocation of tax sources is not completely fair, especially the provincial tax allocation is too small. 2. Although the business tax is clearly defined as a provincial tax, it is also stipulated that half of it should be returned to the county, which is similar to a tax source shared by the province and county, and the name does not match the reality. 3. Provincial revenue is extremely scarce. The main provincial revenue is only 20% of the agricultural tax and 50% of the business tax. It is still difficult to achieve self-sufficiency to support provincial undertakings. County and municipal finances have seen a large increase in legal tax sources since the reform, and a considerable foundation has been laid in terms of the system. However, because county and municipal expenditures are not necessarily based entirely on legal budgets or the requirements of autonomous undertakings, and because temporary expenditures to meet the orders of superiors or military supplies are often several times greater than normal expenditures, they are generally still in a state of insufficient income and expenditure. In recent years, the increase and expansion of county and municipal institutions have also been the root cause of the difficulty in eradicating miscellaneous levies.</p>
<p>Let me further elaborate on the Ministry's handling of the problem of miscellaneous levies and apportionments in local areas: The central government has repeatedly strictly prohibited local apportionments and miscellaneous taxes. The Ministry has paid special attention to this issue for a long time. In 1946 alone, the Ministry supervised the abolition of more than 70 types of miscellaneous and difficult taxes. Recently, in order to effectively clarify miscellaneous levies and apportionments, we have formulated five measures: 1. It is proposed to request the Executive Yuan to issue a general order to all ministries and departments of the central government and provincial commissions that the funds required for matters entrusted to counties and cities should be allocated by the entrusting agency in a dedicated manner. 2. After the budget is approved, if new local undertakings need to be carried out, a supplementary budget should be prepared in accordance with the law and submitted for approval before implementation is allowed. 3. No illegal collection agency shall collect any funds or materials from the people, and even legal collection agencies shall not collect illegal taxes or apportion funds or materials from the people. Violators shall be punished in accordance with Article 129 of the Criminal Law. 4. County and city magistrates shall be jointly liable for any connivance or leniency in the illegal apportionment of their subordinate grassroots administrative agencies, or for negligent supervision, if verified by public complaint. 5. If county governments and township and village personnel arbitrarily apportion local levies, the people are allowed to list the facts and evidence and directly report to the provincial government or the central government. After verification, severe penalties will be imposed. The above supplementary measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The above report is about the important financial and monetary measures of the past year. We will continue to work hard in the future to strengthen the coordination between financial and economic policies, with the goal of increasing agricultural and industrial production, enriching the national economy, stabilizing prices, and balancing income and expenditure. Although the current financial and economic situation is difficult, I firmly believe that as long as everyone recognizes the goals, works together, and strives, all difficulties can be overcome.

<h3>Steps to Stabilize the People's Food Supply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rice prices in Shanghai plummeted, with top-grade white japonica dropping to the 400,000 yuan per shi mark, a decrease of about 200,000 to 300,000 yuan from the previous day, but still up 52.6% from the end of January this year. Whether the supply is sufficient and whether there are supply problems still depends on the efforts of officials and merchants. It can be seen that the seriousness of the people's food problem has not yet been resolved. The local government is reorganizing an agency to handle distribution, and the city councilors are also paying close attention to this and are said to be proposing six specific measures for discussion, which further demonstrates the importance and urgency of this issue.</p>
<p>In summary, the focus of this issue is twofold: insufficient quantity and high prices. The main reason for the high prices is still the insufficient quantity. Therefore, the fundamental solution should start with improving the supply, but in an emergency, it is necessary to start with distribution in order to stabilize rice prices, reassure the people, and ensure that the supplied grain benefits the consuming public and does not flow into the hands of hoarders and profiteers. The distribution agency is being organized, and the survey of impoverished households has already begun. The distribution of rice to schools and factories has also started. The above emergency measures can be said to have matured and only need to be expanded and popularized, which should not be a problem in general. The only problem is how to increase the supply.</p>
<p>According to Mayor Wu's report to the City Council, the city needs 500,000 shi of rice per month, but because some citizens prefer wheat flour and some factories can purchase directly from the producing areas, only about 300,000 shi is actually needed. In addition to supplying 500,000 bags of wheat flour per month, the Ministry of Food is said to supply 120,000 shi of rice. The arrival of rice from the North and South Markets in the city ranges from 1,000 to 7,000 shi per day, averaging 5,000 shi, which yields 150,000 shi per month. Therefore, the supply and demand of rice in the city is roughly balanced, except for special reasons.</p>
<p>The concern is that the free delivery from the North and South Markets and the direct purchases by some factories are too fluid and not very reliable. Whenever the market price in the producing area suddenly changes, or accidents occur during transportation (such as detention or forced purchase), or the city introduces new control measures (such as implementing price limits, negotiated prices, and strict inspection of stored rice), rice merchants often use this as an excuse to temporarily stop purchasing or withhold the arrival of goods. At that time, rice prices inevitably fluctuate again, or even form a situation where there is a market but no supply, and the food crisis cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, in order to improve the supply and stabilize the people's food supply, we believe that the following three points still need to be quickly addressed.</p>
<p>(1) Stabilize the Market. The purpose is to stabilize the grain merchants so that they can freely purchase without being subjected to unexpected twists and turns and troubles. The key is to effectively protect legal transactions, avoid all unnecessary interference, and avoid excessively frequent emergency measures. If such interference and emergency measures are deemed necessary in fact, they should be extra cautious and strive to be reasonable, legal, and legitimate to protect their due interests.</p>
<p>(2) Strictly Prohibit Obstruction. This refers to the transportation of rice. Although free circulation has been repeatedly ordered to be followed, in reality, the difficulties, delays, and extortions are still unavoidable. Moreover, it is difficult to explain in law why goods in free circulation must apply for a purchase certificate in advance, undergo inspection and request permission locally, and be checked at every stage during the journey and request clearance. In fact, these problems indirectly increase the cost of rice purchases, so the local authorities should submit a request to the central government to find ways to effectively improve this in order to improve the supply.</p>
<p>(3) Replenish Reserves. With a smooth supply, reserves will naturally be abundant. However, the capital is too heavy, and it is difficult to keep them idle. Accumulating too much often leads to misunderstandings and unexpected troubles. Under the current situation, it is impossible for legitimate rice merchants to purchase and store more to replenish the people's food reserves. We believe that this task should be handled by the local government by raising funds on its own, at least to store enough rice for two or three months. This will provide a buffer against emergencies and be sufficient to bear the responsibility of regulation and contingency. As for this rice, if it is inconvenient to purchase more from domestic producing areas, other methods should be considered to purchase from Siam or Vietnam. Therefore, where to purchase from and how to raise the funds are all technical issues that can be handed over to the Food Distribution Committee for consideration.</p>
<p>In short, today's food issues are no longer a question of whether to plan, but have entered the question of how to plan. Fortunately, the local government has already established a special agency to effectively take on this responsibility, not just to be satisfied with price limits, negotiated prices, or selling stored rice. If the above suggestions can be adopted and implemented, I believe that the supply and demand of rice can be smoothly resolved, and we will no longer have to treat the symptoms rather than the cause, constantly living in emergency measures!</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Still Seeks Control Over Islands Surrounding Homeland, Especially Attentive to South Kuril Islands</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th Dispatch] Japan will strive at the peace conference to prevent the Soviet Union from annexing the South Kuril Islands, and will request the return of the seven islands north of Hokkaido that were occupied by the Soviet army after its surrender. The Japanese government submitted a memorandum to the Allied Headquarters in November of last year concerning the above issue, and attached historical proofs and documents to support its position. That is, the Kuril Islands south of the Iturup Strait have always been Japanese territory, and the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Islands, which are currently under Soviet occupation, are not part of the Kuril Islands granted to the Soviet Union under the Yalta Agreement, but are historically and geographically part of the four Japanese islands. Japan would be satisfied if the South Kuril Islands were placed under United Nations trusteeship or similar measures, allowing Japan to fish between and around those islands, but the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Islands must be returned to Japanese sovereignty. An official spokesperson for the Japanese government explained that Japanese fishermen catch 3 million yen worth of kelp annually between the Habomai Islands and Shikotan Islands, accounting for 40% of Japan's total output from all islands. The total output of kelp from Hokkaido accounts for 97% of the total output, and it occupies an important position in Japan, where there is almost no meat. Japanese officials emphasize that if the Soviet Union occupies the South Kuril Islands, it will harm Japanese fisheries in the northern territorial waters, because the Soviet side insists on implementing a 12-mile radius limit, meaning that Japanese fishing boats are not allowed to enter that area to fish, which in effect excludes Japanese fishermen from the South Kuril Islands. Japan also hopes that the peace conference will stipulate measures to allow Japanese fishing boats to navigate around the Ryukyu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands, and is currently considering recommending the return of Amami Oshima, located between Kyushu and the Ryukyus, to Japan. Although the area is not currently occupied, it is still outside Japanese territory because the Allied forces stipulate that Japanese territory is limited to north of 30 degrees north latitude. Amami Oshima has always been administratively part of Kagoshima Prefecture in Kyushu, not Okinawa Prefecture, and its people and customs are the same as those of the four Japanese islands. In this regard, the principle in the Atlantic Charter that no territorial changes should be made that are inconsistent with the freely expressed wishes of the people can be applied to the island. In this regard, Japanese officials clearly hope that this provision will also be applied to the Ryukyus, or even the South Kuril Islands, if the islands are placed under trusteeship; in other words, future Japan will have the opportunity to demand a plebiscite.</p>
<h3>Japanese Socialist Party Issues Formal Statement: Decides to Abandon Four-Party Coalition; Support for Yoshida's New Cabinet from Shidehara Makes Optimism Difficult</h3>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] The Socialist Party issued a statement at 5:00 PM on the 28th, stating, "The Socialist Party, bearing the responsibility of being the leading party, has strived to form a four-party coalition cabinet. However, the Liberal Party's statement today has greatly distorted the facts. Although Chairman Katayama promised President Yoshida that the left-wing would not join the cabinet, the Liberal Party still demanded a concrete assurance from the Socialist Party that it would not be influenced by the left wing. The Prime Minister yesterday even offered the Liberal Party a guarantee that the left wing would not join the cabinet. At the same time, in order to conduct democratic negotiations, the party prepared to compromise, but the Liberal Party did not change its attitude. Despite our party's utmost efforts, a four-party coalition cabinet remains impossible. Going forward, the Socialist Party will devote its full efforts to completing the formation of a three-party coalition cabinet."</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] The Democratic Party convened successive meetings of its top leadership in the morning and afternoon of the 28th. On the same day, it held a secret meeting of its members to discuss the Socialist Party's proposal for a three-party coalition cabinet. As a result of the discussions, opinions could not be unified. The opinions of Shidehara, Saito, Kimura, Tanaka, Itimatsu, and one other were at odds with those of Ashida, Hayashi, Nagano, Yano, and one other. The former advocated adopting the same attitude as the Liberal Party or reconsidering policies. The latter favored forming a coalition cabinet with the Socialist Party. The division between the conservative and reformist factions within the Democratic Party has now become very clear.</p>
<p>[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Mr. Rikizo Hirano of the Social Democratic Party visited the private residence of Secretary-General Ohno of the Liberal Party at 10:30 PM on the 27th to inquire about Secretary-General Ohno's opinions on the conditions for the coalition proposed by the Democratic Party. Ohno immediately stated that the Liberal Party had no room for considering those conditions.</p>
<h3>Rumor that U.S. State Department Will Take Over Japan and Korea</h3>
<p>MacArthur Headquarters Says It May Be Misinformation</p>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 27th] Regarding the matter of the State Department taking over the administration of Korea and Japan, which are currently under U.S. military administration, sources here claim: The U.S. military occupation zone in South Korea will be transferred from the Department of the Army to the State Department around July. The timing of the takeover of Japan will depend on the situation in Korea. However, optimists believe it can be realized by autumn.</p>
<p>[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] It has been rumored in Washington that before a peace treaty is signed between the Allied nations and Japan, the administration of Japan will be transferred from the Department of the Army to the State Department. A spokesman for the Allied General Headquarters recently commented on this matter, stating that he had heard of it but doubted that any changes would occur before a peace treaty is signed, as any changes would require the agreement of all Allied nations. The Allied General Headquarters is unaware of any plans to change the organization of the Allied General Headquarters before a peace treaty is signed. The U.S. military occupation zones in Korea, Germany, and Austria differ somewhat from Japan. In the aforementioned U.S. military occupation zones, the U.S. administration is unilateral, while the Allied General Headquarters' administration of Japan is international. Therefore, this change would require action by the eleven nations of the Far Eastern Commission. Therefore, the rumor regarding the transfer of administration of Japan is likely misinformation.</p>
<h3>Wei Lihuang Visits France: Observes Air Force Base</h3>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Bordeaux, 27th] General Wei Lihuang, accompanied by General Piollet, Chief of Staff of the French Air Force, led a delegation today to inspect the French air base and air force school near here. They returned to Paris at 4:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Bestial Nature of the Japanese Is Inherent; Vigilance Should Be Exercised to Prevent Relapse</h3>
<p>[Associated Press, Tokyo, 28th] After indicting Japanese war criminals for seventeen months, Mr. Carpenter, the legal director of MacArthur Headquarters, stated today that the bestial nature of the Japanese is inherent. Although it is temporarily suppressed at present, it will reemerge once unleashed. Americans today should not be deceived by the superficial courtesy of the Japanese. One can tell they have absolutely no manners by observing the way Japanese men treat women. I believe that punishing Japanese war criminals is the most valuable development because we can thereby uphold international law.</p>
<h3>Viet Minh Resolved to Fight to the End Due to Unacceptable French Conditions; Ho Chi Minh Calls on French People to Cooperate in Striving for Peace</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Saigon, 27th] The Viet Minh radio station broadcast yesterday an appeal from President Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh Republic to the French people, begging for their assistance in saving peace. He said that French colonialists have launched a war in the past twenty months, and countless numbers of French and Vietnamese people have been sacrificed. The Viet Minh government, in accordance with its peaceful intentions, proposed a ceasefire to the French government on April 25th and began peace negotiations. Unexpectedly, the French side put forward the following conditions: (1) surrender the weapons of the Viet Minh army; (2) the French army has freedom of movement throughout Viet Minh territory; (3) all soldiers opposed to the Viet Minh are under the command of the French military headquarters. It is evident that the French side, intoxicated by temporary success, has put forward unacceptable and insulting conditions, making it impossible for the peoples of the two countries to approach each other. The responsibility for continuing the war lies entirely with the French side. All we desire is peace and to obtain unity and independence within the French Union. Now, forced by French warmongering colonialists, we will fight to the end until victory is achieved. We hope the people of France will assist us in saving the lives of French youth and Vietnamese people.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Saigon, 27th] It is widely rumored here that the Kingdom of Annam is expected to be restored soon. Mr. Bollaert, the French Commissioner to Vietnam, visited Saint-Jacques in Cochinchina today, where he met former King Thanh Thai of Annam. According to a spokesman for the newly established All-Vietnam National Front, there will be even more surprising developments in the Viet Minh negotiations next week.</p>
<p>[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] Reliable sources here declared tonight: They have no knowledge of reports in Saigon newspapers that the Viet Minh government has sent a written peace proposal to France.</p>
<h3>Dutch Suggest Forming a Dutch-Indonesian Joint Government</h3>
<p>[United Press, Batavia, 28th] Well-informed sources claimed today that the Dutch Colonial Ministry has suggested that a joint provisional government, immediately organized by both Dutch and Indonesian Republican personnel, serve as the initial step towards establishing a federal United States of Indonesia. The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Van Mook, has submitted a written statement to Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir containing several final Dutch proposals, the aforementioned being one of them. It is said that although the Dutch statement is not an ultimatum, if Indonesia refuses to accept it or if its response is unsatisfactory to the Dutch, the entire issue of negotiations with the Republic will be submitted to the Dutch government for resolution.

<h3>Mountbatten Returns to India Today; Indian Constitutional Plan to Proceed in Three Stages; Returning Leaders to India Urge the People to Maintain Law and Order</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 27th] Governor-General Mountbatten of India will depart London this Thursday in order to hold a meeting in New Delhi on June 2 with Indian leaders regarding the procedures for the transfer of power. He will hold a final pre-departure meeting tomorrow with cabinet experts on Indian affairs. Prime Minister Attlee has also hurried back to London from Margate, where the Labor Party annual conference is being held, to participate. Political figures believe that the New Delhi meeting starting on June 2 is part of the three stages of the Indian constitutional plan. The first stage is to determine whether India will be unified or divided. The second stage is to solicit the opinions of elected representatives from across India. The third stage is for the top Indian leaders to decide on the final method of partition based on the results of the previous stages. It is generally expected that these three stages can be completed in a few months. It is anticipated that the geographical boundaries of India can be clearly determined by this summer, and the mechanism for the transfer of power can be effectively utilized.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Calcutta, 27th] It is widely rumored here that an unprecedented large-scale disturbance will occur starting on June 2, causing widespread anxiety. The authorities have dispatched planes to scatter leaflets from the sky to reassure the people. The Governor of Bengal, Burrows, personally delivered a radio address to reassure the people. At the same time, returning leaders to India jointly issued a call for peace. The declaration was signed by nine leaders from the Muslim League and the Congress Party, including Gandhi and Jinnah. It stated that there have been recent rumors that a major riot will occur on June 2, the day the Governor-General informs Indian leaders of the British government's plan to transfer power to India, causing widespread anxiety. The British government's plan may not be acceptable to all parties, and some individuals or factions may not be satisfied. However, under no circumstances should violence be used to maintain law and order.</p>
<h3>India to Be Divided into Three Zones to Become a Dominion</h3>
<p>[United Press, London, 27th] Reliable sources recently declared that Governor-General Mountbatten of India will propose a "three-tier constitution" after returning to his post, making India a dominion to be governed by Mountbatten in his capacity as Governor-General. The Muslim League is still expressing its opposition, but it is generally expected that the Governor-General will proceed with his plans based on the plan agreed upon with the British cabinet. It is said that the British cabinet's proposal includes the following three items: (1) Hindu-majority provinces will be designated as one zone; (2) the provinces of Punjab, Northwest Frontier Province, Sindh, and Baluchistan will be designated as one zone; (3) the provinces of Bengal and Assam will be designated as one zone. With the exception of defense, foreign affairs, and transportation, which will be managed by the central supreme authority, all other political affairs in the aforementioned three zones will be self-governed by each zone. It is widely believed that Governor-General Mountbatten, now with the full support of the British cabinet, will change his plans and implement the aforementioned proposals. This action is likely to dissolve the existing provisional government and restore it to the status of a dominion.</p>

<h3>Municipal Council Forms Special Committee: To Assist the Government in Guiding the Student Movement; Directors of Four Bureaus Attend to Answer Inquiries</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council held its second meeting of the Third Session of the First Congress yesterday from 3:00 PM to 7:30 PM at its location on Tanggu Road. 107 councilors attended. More than thirty representatives from the municipal government and various bureaus and offices were present. After the secretariat reported the number of attendees, the councilors began to question the Education Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Health Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau separately. After the questioning was completed, the bureau directors answered respectively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Municipal Council passed yesterday the proposal made by Councilor Tao Baichuan the day before to organize a special committee to guide the student movement. The committee members were nominated by the speaker and approved by the council. It consists of seventeen councilors: Xu Jiqing, Wang Zhengting, Tao Baichuan, Ye Fenghu, Zhao Junhao, Xi Yushu, Pang Jingzhou, Zhao Yangxiong, Zai Zhuyi, Zhan Wenhu, Wang Weiyin, Rong Hongyuan, Huang Shijin, Li Kaidi, Li Wenjie, Ma Junshuo, and Yan Yilin. Xu Jiqing, Wang Zhengting, and Tao Baichuan will convene a meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon in the office of the speaker of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>In addition, the three tasks of the committee were determined: (1) Investigate the truth of the student movement; (2) Draft a message to the parents of students and school principals, hoping that the student movement will be resolved soon; (3) If necessary, the committee can assist the government authorities and school authorities in guiding the student movement to a speedy resolution.</p>
<p>Regarding the Greater Shanghai Plan, the council also passed a resolution to organize a review committee. Twenty-nine councilors were nominated to form the committee: Xu Jiqing, Zhang Zhihan, Zhu Wende, Wang Zhuyi, Yang Shukang, Xi Yushu, Lu Yinchu, Tang Shichang, Zhang Xuelian, Xu Yongzuo, Li Kaidi, Xu Xueyu, Huang Bingquan, Zhou Feicheng, Wang Weiyin, Zhao Junhao, Wang Yansong, Jin Runxiang, Zhao Yangxiong, Zhu Kaiguan, Tong Xingbai, Wei Yunqing, Zhai Shi, Zhou Xiangsheng, Rong Hongsan, Jiang Hao, Zhou Xuexiang, Fan Shouyuan, and Pang Jingzhou. Xu Jiqing, Xu Xueyu, and Xi Wangshu will serve as conveners. A review meeting is scheduled to be held at the Municipal Council at 3:00 PM tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<h3>Only Empty Names of Schools: No School Addresses Can Be Found; Councilors Question the Education Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The inquiries made by the councilors to the Public Works, Public Utilities, Health, and Education Bureaus yesterday are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Education: Councilors paid special attention to the student movement issue. Jiang Huaisu said that the student movement should be prevented before it happens. After things have occurred, those that can be stopped should be stopped, and those that cannot be stopped should also have a method. Force should never be used. It is alright to protect the march and avoid conflicts with the military police or citizens. Meetings should not be prevented either. In this way, the student movement will subside on its own. He also described his previous experiences with student movements and how he handled them in Jiangxi. Wang Weiyin said: (1) The biggest reason for the student movement is dissatisfaction with the current politics. Sympathy and understanding should be given. The authorities should not excessively destroy it in order to consolidate the nation. I ask the Director of the Education Bureau how he views the student movement! (2) The council resolved at the first congress to establish women's normal schools, commercial schools, vocational schools, and agricultural schools within one year, and to establish several junior high schools in the suburbs. But a year has passed. How much has the Education Bureau done in this regard? Wang Liben said: (1) The supervisory work of the Education Bureau itself must be corrected and strictly attended to. (2) Why are the salaries of newly hired colleagues in each school often two months late compared to the original colleagues? Zhu Ya Kui asked: Do the private schools comply with the Education Bureau's order and have they fully refunded the fees to those who exceed the prescribed purchase standard?</p>
<p>Are There Plans for National Primary Schools?</p>
<p>Zhang Yiqu asked: (1) What is the distribution of municipal national primary schools? Is there a unified plan? (2) The Old Zha District is the commercial center of Shanghai and pays the most taxes, but no national primary school is established. Can the authorities be requested to set up one quickly? Zhang Zhongyuan said that he represents the cultural and artistic community and requests that the municipal government establish an art gallery in the city center for colleagues to use for leisure. Pan Jiemei said: Does the Education Bureau pay attention to the enrollment situation of vocational and general education at all times? Sometimes a class is set up in three or four schools, which is purely a waste of money. Zhang Xuelian said: It is often heard that there are schools in the city with only empty names. The statistical table lists the number of students and teachers, but the school address cannot be found at that address. What is going on! Sun Zhenchun hopes that many of the municipal councilors who are school principals should lead by example and pay attention to supervision.</p>
<p>Striking Middle Schools Have All Resumed Classes</p>
<p>Vice Director Li Ximou of the Education Bureau, representing Director Gu Yuxiu, who went to Beijing on official business, selectively answered the education questions as follows: (1) Regarding the student movement, because it started in the universities, the Education Bureau has no reason to interfere. Later, because it involved primary schools, the bureau immediately convened all middle school principals in the city to discuss the handling methods. It was stipulated that if university students come to the school to promote strikes, two methods should be adopted to deal with it: (1) refuse them peacefully, (2) if it is ineffective, report to the nearby police station. This time, Mailun and Jiaotong Middle Schools had strikes for several days, and now they have resumed classes. Currently, it can be said that there are no middle schools on strike. At the same time, someone used the phone to impersonate the Education Bureau to order middle school students to strike. After hearing the news, the bureau immediately published a statement stating that there was no such thing.</p>
<p>Have Not Heard of Private Schools Collecting Rice</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the issue of fees for private schools, in the last semester, there were 20 schools, including Lingnan, Jinke, and the affiliated middle school of Shanghai University, that exceeded the prescribed fees, and 21 primary schools. All of them have been ordered to refund the fees. Unless it is transferred to purchase books and instruments, it will be exempted from investigation after verification, and the rest will be dealt with separately. Regarding the councilor's statement that it is rumored that private middle schools will collect rice in lieu of fees next semester, with 5 shi for universities, 3 shi for middle schools, and 1 shi for primary schools, the bureau has not heard of it. (3) Academic advancement fees will be refunded, with 30,000 yuan per person for middle schools and 20,000 yuan per person for primary schools. Other inquiries will be answered in writing.</p>
<h3>Installing a Telephone Requires Gold Bars; Evidence Can Be Submitted; Single-Person Tricycles Easily Tip Over; Attention Should Be Paid</h3>
<p>Regarding public utilities, the following inquiries were made: Chen Peide asked: (1) After rickshaws are converted into single-person tricycles, they often overturn. The Public Utilities Bureau should pay attention to safety issues. (2) I applied to the authorities for a suburban telephone some time ago, and they said it would be installed soon, but why hasn't it been installed yet? Ma Junshuo asked: Citizens install telephones for convenience and speed. Why does the telephone company secretly stop the current of automatic telephones? Also, when making calls in the western district, operators often deliberately make things difficult. Can the Public Utilities Bureau strictly supervise this? Zhao Yangxiong also requested more suburban telephones and, on behalf of the residents of the southern city, opposed the conversion of the outer roads into warehouse areas. Chen Boliang said: (1) Installing a telephone requires gold bars. I know for a fact that installing a telephone costs 10 million, and an extension costs 2 million. If the director of the Public Utilities Bureau wants evidence, it can be provided, but can the bureau strictly stop this? (2) There are tricycle companies, but no tricycles. Please investigate this strictly. Lu Shidao inquired: There are currently several vehicles in this city that have already paid taxes and been issued licenses. However, because regulations prohibit transfer, disputes have arisen repeatedly. Why not completely resolve the vehicle license issue and allow free transfer? Zhu Wende asked: Will public utility deposits continue to be collected in the future?</p>
<p>Accident Tricycles All Fail to Meet Standards</p>
<p>There were several other inquiries regarding public utilities. Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau categorized and responded separately: (1) The Public Utilities Bureau pays close attention to single-person tricycles. The regulated standards for converting rickshaws are: 25 inches high, 30 inches wide, and 66 inches long. However, according to police reports, the tricycles involved in accidents did not meet the standards, so they should be banned. (2) Suburban telephones are difficult to install in large numbers at the moment because the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications lacks materials. (3) The Public Utilities Bureau has studied a unified plan for training telephone technicians and telephone management, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan. However, the Yuan ordered to maintain the status quo for the time being, so it has not been implemented. The municipal government plans to ask the Executive Yuan to approve it again soon. The number of calls in the central district is increasing daily, and the company can only increase equipment and external lines. Foreign exchange is currently being applied for.</p>
<p>Water Shortage in the Western District of Shanghai; Adding Water Faucets</p>
<p>(4) Street lights in alleys that belong to the public are installed by the Public Utilities Bureau. Those that belong to private individuals can be installed according to the method of managing street lights for private individuals. (5) There is a water shortage in the western district of Shanghai. Engineers have been dispatched to investigate the addition of water taps and the repair of leaking pipes. Only public water taps can be installed in shantytowns. (6) There are currently no plans for the Nanshi Outer Road warehouse area. (7) Public utility deposits are collected according to central regulations. (8) Regarding the issue of car transfers, some cars in the city are quite suspicious. To prevent enemy property from being occupied, there are restrictions on transfers. If evidence of property rights can be provided, the transfer can be approved. This matter has now been discussed and agreed upon with the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office, and the Central Trust Bureau is planning unified processing.</p>
<p>Telephone Demands Gold Bars; Difficulty in Obtaining Evidence</p>
<p>(9) Although I have heard about the need for gold bars to install telephones, I have no evidence. I hope everyone can provide evidence, and we will definitely deal with it strictly. (10) Regarding the issue of tricycle companies having no tricycles, it has now been decided that tricycle license applications will not be handled by the companies; they must be registered individually. (11) The lights and tap water in Nanshi are often cut off due to excessive electricity and damaged switches. Improvements are also being made.</p>

<h3>Health Inquiries</h3>
<p>Health-related inquiries: Zhu Yakui said: Public toilets reek and are filthy. Please thoroughly clean them up, Health Bureau. The garbage problem remains unresolved. As the weather gets warmer, please pay special attention. Zhang Zhongyuan asked: (1) On May 11, the newspaper reported that doctors and nurses from the Shanghai Health Office would resign en masse. Why is that? (2) The city's major health services are handled by other agencies. The Health Bureau's work seems very light, so can staff be reduced and expenses saved? Shi Qian asked to relocate the coffin placement station on Anyuan Road. Lu Keming said: Hospital management and supervision are quite inadequate. He went to see a doctor at a hospital on Haig Road and smelled a bad odor as soon as he entered.</p>
<p>Director Zhang of the Health Bureau responded: (1) It is best to completely abolish public toilets and sell grass paper while people bring their own paper. Public toilets should be the responsibility of contractors, who should paint and repair them every three months. The bureau sends people to investigate from time to time and will strengthen management in the future. (2) The coffin placement station on Anyuan Road will definitely be relocated before the end of October. (3) The news of the mass resignation of doctors and nurses at the Health Office is actually a misrepresentation. In fact, more than a dozen employees of the Yangshupu office overpaid their salaries, and they had to be deducted when salaries were paid. They then requested resignation, but after being allowed to deduct less, they continued to work. (4) Epidemic prevention and health work cannot be done without the vast power of society. The bureau currently has a great deal of work and personnel to deal with, and there is no free time, but it will supervise personnel handling affairs at any time. (5) The leaking of manure trucks is due to a lack of funding, and it is impossible to repair them all at once. The municipal government has now allocated some funds and should be able to complete the repairs before summer.</p>
<h3>Dissatisfaction with Road Administration; Suspected of Cutting Corners; Director Zhao Explains Difficulties; Asphalt is Four Times More Expensive Than Tar</h3>
<p>Public Works: Shi Zongde claimed that there was a great deal of road damage, and the Public Works Bureau's road repairs seemed to be "cutting corners." Chen Peide claimed: Several highways in Pudong and the Pudong area have not been repaired to this day, and there has been no news of the Pudong Bridge since the resolution was passed by the Assembly. Shao Yongsheng believes that the road administration is too bad and hopes that the Public Works Bureau will use every cent of the citizens' hard-earned money. Zhao Yangxiong said: Park tickets cost 20 yuan; it is better to open them for free. Pan Jiemei also said that there is no planning for road repairs, etc., and the work is slow. Hou Junren requested to dredge the Xinjinggang River and ban the houses that obstruct traffic in the Houjiazhai area of Fahua Town. Chen Boliang said: The Public Works Bureau does not allow people to voluntarily repair roads and bridges. It is rumored that citizens contract for cheaper work, while the bureau's contract work is more expensive.</p>
<h3>Director of the Public Works Bureau Responds Point by Point</h3>
<p>Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau responded: (1) The city's roads have not been repaired for many years, and there is too much damage. Moreover, the number of vehicles has increased, causing even more damage. The bureau's manpower, equipment, and materials are limited and can only be handled step by step according to the urgency of the situation. Currently, it can only repair those that are about to break down and cannot repair those that have already broken down. Road repairs are planned, starting with the central area, then the suburbs, and then the roads with trams and buses. (2) Road repair work is also carried out at night, but the reason why it is not carried out at night at the moment is that there are few workers and a lack of equipment and funds. At the same time, road repairs must be carried out at high temperatures, and will begin again when the weather gets hot. (3) Cutting corners is not the case; it is saving materials. Because foreign asphalt is about four times more expensive than tar, more tar must be used. (4) Dredging the river and repairing Pudong Avenue, the design work has long been completed. They can only be repaired gradually due to limited funds.</p>

<h3>American Wishes to Invest in the Pudong Bridge</h3>
<p>Regarding the construction of the Pudong Bridge, Mr. Kangwei said that Americans may invest in the construction of an overpass. If successful, or if the US loan of 500 million US dollars is allocated to Shanghai, it can be started. (5) Regarding park charges, it has been stipulated that the tickets for five parks, including Zhongshan, Zhongzheng, Huangpu, Linsen, and Fuxing, will be changed from 20 yuan to 200 yuan each, and the other nine parks will be opened for free. Because some parks are connected to schools, there is too much damage after opening. (6) The Xinjinggang River dredging was also not included in the budget due to funding reasons. Now that it has been raised, it can be included in next year's budget. The houses in Houjiazhai, Fahua, are dormitories for employees of the Central Mint. Personnel can be dispatched to investigate. If it is indeed occupying a public transportation area, they can be ordered to be demolished. (7) Private construction of roads and bridges is not prohibited, and the Public Works Bureau can provide assistance. It is also not true that the Public Works Bureau's contract work is more expensive than private contract work. If it is found out, it will definitely be revoked.</p>
<h3>Unclaimed Coffins in the Suburbs Will Be Cremated Starting in August</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Health Bureau submitted to the Municipal Government for approval to clear unclaimed coffins in the suburbs by district and sub-district. Starting in June and July, the Xuan Shi area in the suburbs of North China's Xinjing has been dispatched for numbering. All unclaimed coffins must be buried by the end of July of this year. Overdue coffins will be treated as unclaimed coffins. The Health Bureau will cremate or bury them on the designated location.</p>

<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Frank Yang Ge, an American temporary pilot of the former General Aviation Transportation Brigade, was previously tried by the District Court on the 21st for privately bringing firearms to Shanghai from the Philippines.

Li William, the vice consul of the American Consulate, attended the hearing yesterday, and Yang Ge was still released on bail.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Murder on Xinzha Road; Cloth Vendor and Ticket Seller Killed</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] Li Xiangchen, a native of Anhui in his late 50s, lived at No. 66, Lane 1536, Xinzha Road. He traveled between Shanghai and Zhenjiang as a cloth vendor. At about 10 p.m. last night, as Li was preparing to undress and go to bed, several robbers suddenly arrived. Two robbers broke into Li's residence, and the remaining robbers stood guard on the side of the road. Two packages of cloth and 4 million yuan in legal tender were robbed. Li Xiangchen firmly refused to let go, angering the robbers. One robber fired a shot, which hit his lower left back. As a result, the robbers escaped with the stolen goods. Li chased after the pain, and after walking a few steps, he arrived at the mouth of the alley and shouted loudly. Wang Zhihong, a neighbor from No. 23 Pi Zi (ticket seller for the British Electric Tram Company, No. 1230), heard the sound and thought there was a fire, and rushed out the door. When he arrived at the mouth of the alley, he was also shot by the robbers, hitting his heart, piercing his back, and falling to the ground and dying. At this time, Li Xiangchen turned around and fled back to his residence, fell to the ground in extreme pain, and was barely breathing. Later, neighbors heard the alarm and rushed over and called an ambulance to take him to the hospital for treatment, but it was too late, and he also died.</p>

<h3>Labor-Management Evaluation Committee Formulates Detailed Rules for Implementing Wage Adjustments After Unfreezing the Cost of Living Index</h3>
<p>[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Labor-Management Evaluation Committee held its tenth meeting in the conference room of the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, presided over by Chairman Wu Kaixian. The meeting discussed the calculation methods for piecework, overtime, work stoppages, and vacations for workers in various industries after the cost of living index was unfrozen. The detailed rules for implementing the "Provisional Measures for Wage Adjustment in Shanghai" are as follows:</p>
<p>Piecework: For piecework wages calculated according to the cost of living index, the actual monthly base salary should be calculated and paid in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the "Provisional Measures for Wage Adjustment in Shanghai." However, to encourage production, the highest production volume of each department in the six months before the index was unfrozen can be used as a standard. Wages for the part exceeding the standard should be paid in full to show encouragement.</p>
<p>Overtime: The base salary for overtime wages will not be discounted, but if there is a bonus wage in addition to the overtime wage in the grain industry, the bonus wage part will still be added to the total base salary and discounted.</p>
<p>Work Stoppages: Whether or not wages are paid for work stoppages or leave, the calculation is based on the actual base salary earned by the worker during the period of work stoppage or leave.</p>
<p>Vacations: Wages for national holidays, weekly holidays, and other designated holidays shall be paid in accordance with regulations. If the employer wants the worker to work as usual, the overtime wage for that day should be paid in full without any discount.</p>

<h3>Letter of Correction</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: The news of the May 26 bloodshed at our school published in your newspaper on the 27th does not conform to the facts. Please correct it as follows: "Our association held an evening party on the evening of the 26th to welcome the return of students who were arrested for no reason. On their way back to the dormitory, the students were threatened with gunfire by dozens of thugs, followed by beatings with iron rulers and wooden sticks. At the same time, the street lights were turned off. This is obviously a planned conspiracy. Three students were seriously injured and are now in the hospital in critical condition. More than 20 students were slightly injured. Therefore, this bloodshed incident was purely an act of violence by thugs and was definitely not a dispute over 'striking' or 'returning to class.'" Sincerely, Student Union of National Fudan University, May 28.</p>

Dr. Zheng Dingzhu of the Anti-Tuberculosis Clinic recently came to the office and said that he is willing to hold free and reduced-fee anti-tuberculosis X-ray photography after moving to a new location on June 1, for a total of 150 photos to benefit the poor and sick. Dr. Zheng is skilled in treating lungs, and his Anti-Tuberculosis Clinic is well-equipped and is a major bulwark against tuberculosis.

<h3>Responding to the Call for Peaceful Nation Building: Religious Followers Establish Grand Alliance</h3>
<p>The "China Religious Followers' Peaceful Nation Building Grand Alliance," aiming to unite followers of all different types of religions to realize peace and dedicate themselves to national construction, was declared established here yesterday. The initiators were Jiang Weiqiao, Li Yujie, Da Pusheng, Xu Langxi, Ding Fubao, Tecang, Tianhui, Tang Huaiqun, Fan Songfu, Zhang Enpu, Cheng Jingsheng, Wang Xiaolai, and over seventy others. They issued a declaration and sent a telegram to the Political Consultative Conference calling for peace. The declaration is as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration</p>
<p>We have no strong political interests, nor do we intend, at any time or in any environment, to engage in power struggles for personal gain. However, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, we were deeply enlightened by objective reality and profoundly understood that the powerful manifestation of the altruistic spirit of religious figures cannot be completely outside of politics. Therefore, we began to prepare for the formation of an alliance to unite religious forces and promote open-minded politics. In recent years, the domestic and international situation has gradually become dangerous, and the incredibly brutal civil war will destroy the people, destroy the country, and even expand and spread to destroy the world. If people from all religious systems are not gathered to jointly call for peace and change this dangerous political tendency, not only will the distant prospect of human prosperity and happiness become a mirage, but also the salvation goals of all religions will never be reached. Therefore, our reasons for organizing the alliance are extremely simple: one is to quickly and effectively strive for peace, and the other is to work together wholeheartedly to assist in national construction. From the former perspective, we must consider the people and soldiers on the line of death, we must consider the vast masses on the line of starvation, and we must consider the entire humanity and the future of the world. We will not hesitate to take any action or make any appeals to immediately stop the war. Even if there is sacrifice for this, we will not hesitate. Currently, with anxious and earnest emotions, we hope that all intermediate parties, social elites, and members of the Political Consultative Conference will overcome all difficulties and continue to strive for peace, without being swayed by the intentions of the warring parties.</p>
<p>We are willing to do our utmost</p>
<p>to support this action. No matter how difficult, how dangerous, or how despised and slandered the task is that is conducive to peace, we are all happy to share it. Even if the facts require us to appeal to the Communist army areas, we are willing to brave bullets and endure hardships to give it a try. Even if those in charge of peace do not want to travel far lightly, we can do it alone. Even if there are any obstacles, we will never be afraid. From the latter perspective, the country has been suffering from a long and bitter war, and the people's livelihood has been extremely depleted. In the future, to engage in construction, we must unite the nation's human and material resources on the basis of peace and democracy to struggle together. We believe that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's complete teachings can still lead national construction, and some of the policies in the Communist army areas are also progressive and can be used as a reference for the government. If the outstanding members of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can cooperate sincerely and not let their forces cancel each other out, they can both serve as the backbone of national construction. Other intermediate parties also have talent and experience. If they are not used for unnecessary disputes, they can all achieve excellent results.</p>
<p>We believe that the issue of national construction</p>
<p>is not limited to governance alone, and political problems are not limited to officials alone. If we can obtain correct leadership, everyone can share the responsibility of future construction, and everyone will have the opportunity to develop their talents and aspirations. We, as religious followers, organize the alliance for no other purpose. We are all religious followers, but our religious beliefs are not completely consistent. Therefore, the conditions for the formation of this alliance are political rather than religious. Moreover, we must maintain the solemnity and sanctity of freedom of belief and never force agreement or disagreement. Therefore, the members of this alliance participate in their individual capacity and do not represent groups. However, if it is mistakenly believed that this alliance emphasizes politics and neglects religion, then it is not so. Indeed, we have a common understanding that all religions have an altruistic spirit, which is absolutely consistent among various differences. Based on this, we began to generate the motivation to care about politics, began to put forward the demand for peaceful nation building, and began to determine the "foundation" of our understanding of political, economic, domestic, and international issues. Based on this, we began to insist that capitalism and socialism, the United States and the Soviet Union, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should coexist peacefully and replace struggle with competition, rather than encouraging war and expanding the killing. Based on this, we began to not flaunt our purity and isolate ourselves from reality, but instead, with the spirit of religious martyrdom, serve the people, completely disregarding any possible slander and misunderstanding. Thus, we began to emphasize the interests of the people and the country, rather than prioritizing the future of this alliance. We can admit that this alliance is a political party, but we will never emphasize party spirit. We can participate in elections under the premise of democracy, but we will never ignore the talents outside the alliance. We can appeal and run around for the benefit of the people, but we will never be preoccupied with the private interests of this alliance. This is the consistent spirit of this alliance, and this is also where this alliance differs from ordinary political parties. Currently, this alliance's</p>
<p>initial organization has just been completed.</p>
<p>All preparations still await efforts. We never want to boast about history and strength, and even more, we do not want to boast to the people about having a certain number of followers. At present, our only attempt is to respond to the peace movement of various progressive groups and to accept the support from all parties. We hereby extend our friendly and cooperative hand with the utmost sincerity to domestic political parties and all progressive forces to work together and jointly plan for national affairs. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>Telegram to the Political Consultative Conference</h3>
<p>To Secretary-General Shao of the Nanjing Political Consultative Conference and forwarded to the Presidium and all Councilors for your review: "The day of the formation of this alliance coincides with the time when you gentlemen are meeting, and the peace proposal of your council is also the basic proposition of this alliance. We hereby support this effort with the utmost sincerity. If the Communist Party of China is temporarily unwilling to come to Nanjing due to transportation difficulties or other reasons, this alliance will, in the spirit of religion and the common wishes of the Chinese people, go to the Communist army areas to appeal for saving the crisis. We urge your council to persist to the end in order to achieve permanent peace. The China Religious Followers' Peaceful Nation Building Grand Alliance respectfully bows."</p>
<h3>Dispatching Representatives to Nanjing to Negotiate</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] After the establishment of the Religious Followers' Peaceful Nation Building Grand Alliance, in addition to issuing a declaration and sending a telegram to the Political Consultative Conference, it also dispatched representatives to Nanjing last night to negotiate matters related to appealing for peace in the CCP area. According to one of the initiators who told reporters, there are many religious groups that have become political parties in Europe, but in our country, a single religious group is currently insufficient in strength and must unite Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam.</p>

<h3>Zhao Zukang and Others Advise Jiaotong University Students Not to Participate in the June 2nd Parade; Maintain Jiaotong University's School Spirit of Practicality and Truth-Seeking</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper] The Jiaotong University Alumni Association, including Zhao Zukang, Wang Jishan, Zhao Zengyu, Yuan Pilie, Hua Weizhong, and other alumni, recently issued a "Letter to Jiaotong University Students," the original text of which is as follows: "Students, please note: Our Jiaotong University students previously launched a school protection movement due to the Ministry of Education's proposal to stop enrolling students in the naval and marine engineering departments, which eventually led to strikes and petitions. The Alumni Association also sympathized with this and telegraphed Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education to avoid changes. Later, Minister Zhu came to Shanghai and agreed to establish the Marine Engineering Department and the Navigation Management Department, and other petition matters were also agreed to be handled accordingly. The purpose of our students' school protection petition has been gloriously achieved. Unexpectedly, after ten days, in response to other schools, classes have not been resumed, and there is also an intention to participate in the joint parade on June 2nd. The members of this association are deeply concerned. Our Jiaotong University students have always valued practicality and truth-seeking, which has become a trend and is the basis for their ability to become national construction cadres. Now, after the goal of school protection has been achieved, they are confused by external fluctuations and do not hesitate to abandon precious time and waste precious studies to engage in external movements. Is this not contrary to Jiaotong University's school spirit of practicality and truth-seeking? If other dangers occur as a result, and the more than fifty years of history of the alma mater are on the verge of destruction, would this not be painful for those who love it and gladdening for those who hate it? For the sake of protecting the school, for the sake of the glorious future of the alma mater, and for the sake of the nation's vitality, the members of this association dare to list the following three points in all sincerity: (1) Resume classes immediately and restore the normal state of the school; (2) Absolutely do not participate in the parade on June 2nd; (3) The members of this association will do their best to protect all students together with the school authorities. We hope that our dear students will understand the difficulties of the times, maintain the school's reputation, resume classes immediately, and no longer increase the severity of the current turbulent social environment. We hope that you will all consider it."</p>

<h3>Table Tennis League: Jing Yi Narrowly Wins Chunmao</h3>
<p>The Second Shanghai Table Tennis League has been very enthusiastic in recent days. The divisional program has entered an important juncture after four weeks of round-robin battles. The league authorities will suspend the matches for one day tonight to check the results of each division and will continue to hold the fifth week of the schedule starting tomorrow night. In the matches of each division the night before, Jing Yi of the Fourth Division narrowly won Chunmao by reversing a 4-3 defeat, which was the most fortunate. In addition, the battle between Lingyun and Qujin in the Third Division was also quite tense. The Lingyun team members were all young players aged fourteen or fifteen, but they managed to tie with Qujin at 3-3. In the final round, no one from Lingyun responded, so Qunjin was able to win without any effort. Huang Baoli was designated by Lingyun, and the strong teams of Jingwu and Hualian in the Second and Third Divisions showed their strength, which was not something that weak teams could stop.</p>

<h3>University Volleyball Season Opener: Fudan Recovers from Defeat to Win Against Jiaotong; Jinan and Daxia Rescheduled, Shanghai Girls' Team Forfeits</h3>
<p>The inaugural University Volleyball League officially kicked off yesterday at 2:30 PM at the Qingnian Hall Sports Ground on Huashan Road. Yesterday, a total of eight matches were originally scheduled for both men's and women's teams. However, Jinan applied for a postponement due to an incident. After the organizers decided to reschedule the Jinan vs. Daxia match, the women's team of the Sports Academy did not participate, so their match against Fudan was also canceled. In the women's group match between Shanghai and Daxia, only Wang Shan from Shanghai arrived, which was less than the legal number of players, so Shanghai was judged to have forfeited, and Daxia won without a fight. The other matches proceeded smoothly. The match between Zhongshan University and Jiaotong University against Fudan was the most intense, with five sets being played before a winner was determined. The scores of each match are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) School of Commerce defeats Lixin (Women's Group) 21-22, 21-6, 21-8.</p>

<h3>Regulating Food Distribution and Promoting Circulation: Four Banks Jointly Provide Grain Loans; Principles for Grain Mortgage Financing Established; Registered and Approved Grain Merchants Can Apply</h3>
<p>In order to regulate the food supply, the Four Banks have recently established principles for grain mortgage financing. Legally operating grain merchants who purchase and store grain can apply for loans from national banks. Those with more than 200 shi (a unit of dry volume) are required to report to the Ministry of Food for approval. The loan principles are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In order to cooperate with the supply measures for daily necessities for people's livelihoods and promote the circulation of grain, grain merchants in various regions may apply to national banks for grain mortgage financing.</p>
<p>(2) Grain merchants in various regions, based on permits issued by the local grain administration authorities and approved by the Ministry of Food, may apply to national banks for grain mortgages for the purchase and storage of grain. The maximum term shall not exceed two months.</p>
<p>(3) The funds obtained by grain merchants from mortgage loans from banks shall be used for the continued purchase of grain and shall not exceed two months.</p>
<p>(4) If there is a shortage of grain in the local area, or if grain prices fluctuate drastically, the local grain administration authorities may submit a request to the Ministry of Food to order grain merchants to redeem and sell the mortgaged grain on the market within a limited time. Otherwise, the Ministry of Food will order the local grain administration authorities to purchase and sell the grain at the original price plus legal profits.</p>
<p>(5) Grain merchants in various regions shall apply to national banks for mortgage loans in accordance with Article 2 of these measures, and the local grain administration authorities shall be responsible for providing guarantees.</p>
<h3>Abundant Rice Supply: Market Prices Continue to Decline; High-Quality Thin Japonica Rice Nears the 400,000 Mark</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Due to the increasing rice supply and the continuous flow of goods from various regions, the market continued to decline, carrying on the weakness of the previous day. Yesterday, the market registered a total of 6,743 shi of goods arriving. After the opening, due to the sluggish market atmosphere, all parties were watchful and hesitant to buy, resulting in sluggish transactions and a downward trend. High-quality thin japonica rice has fallen close to the 400,000 mark. The decline in other indica rice and Jiangbei pointed rice is even more severe. White japonica rice was priced at 405,000 yuan in the southern market and 410,000 yuan in the northern market. It is reported that Wuhu rice has stopped shipping north and is all going south. Telegrams from Beijing also report that a large number of indica rice, two to three hundred ships' worth, have arrived, so the situation may continue to decline.</p>
<p>The flour distribution has not yet been completed, and digestion has become active, resulting in a sudden increase and a rebound of 10,000 yuan. Bran is scarce in both supply and demand, and the market is generally weak. Soybean cakes have fallen by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, following the decline of various other commodities. Due to the decline in both soybeans and oil cakes, factories are hesitant to buy, resulting in a sharp drop of 10,000 yuan. The oil market is experiencing sluggish sales, with a decline of 10,000 yuan. Mung beans are declining steadily, with a further small decline of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Corn is experiencing idle demand, with a further decline of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum is following the decline with a drop of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Raw peanuts are experiencing a surge in supply and sluggish sales, resulting in a sharp drop of more than 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sesame transactions are few and far between, with high prices and secondary products showing weakness. New broad beans have appeared, arriving in Shanghai from Hangzhou and Yuyao. This is the first time they have appeared this season. The quality of the new goods is good and the value is around 80%. All grains are temporarily looking downstream. Although the flour market is firm, it will be difficult to maintain its position as new wheat comes to market.</p>
<p>Wu Kaixian Concurrently Appointed as Chairman of the Distribution Committee</p>
<p>[Our Report] The organization of the Municipal Food Distribution Committee has been decided in principle after President Zhang of the Central Bank, Chief Accountant Xu of the National Government, Deputy Minister Pang of the Ministry of Food, and Mayor Wu and Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau exchanged opinions and obtained the consent of President Zhang of Nanjing via telegram. It will have three sections, four units, and one office, with more than 100 full-time staff members, and will be under the jurisdiction of the Social Affairs Bureau. Director Wu Kaixian will concurrently serve as the chairman. The candidates for the three standing committee members have also been internally determined and will be filled by Zhang Xiaosong, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, Ren Xianqun, the representative of the Central Trust Bureau, and Ye Baofu, the Counselor of the Ministry of Food. After the establishment of the committee, the original Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau will not be abolished. In the future, the committee will be responsible for the business aspects of the work, while the Food Section will continue to be responsible for the administrative aspects. The draft organization plan and candidates are still to be submitted to tomorrow's municipal meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>Affordable Flour Can Be Distributed Within the Week</p>
<p>[Our Report] The official notice regarding the distribution of affordable flour has been sent to the Flour Industry Association by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. The association has scheduled a meeting with the Central Trust Bureau today to handle the procedures for receiving flour. Distribution is expected to begin within this week. Starting next week, distribution will be conducted daily, except on Sundays.

It is also reported that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau plans to request the Central Trust Bureau to allocate 500,000 bags per month, of which 240,000 bags are intended for direct distribution to citizens for consumption.</p>
<p>Oil Distribution Mechanism to Be Improved</p>
<p>The supply of edible oil for people's livelihoods in this city has been suspended for a long time due to the difficulty in obtaining raw materials for the oil pressing industry. Currently, only the Zhongzhi Oil Factory distributes 350 dan (a unit of weight) per day to regulate the market. The quantity is small, and the distribution to merchants is not widespread. Recently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent a document to the Municipal Government stating that the city's edible oil will be half-funded by the Zhongzhi Oil Factory. In order to improve the distribution mechanism, the Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM today, convening representatives from the third district of the oil pressing industry, including Zhongzhi and Zhongshi. The Ministry of Food has approved the allocation of 4,000 dan per month by the Zhongshi Oil Factory for distribution. As for the Municipal Edible Oil Regulation Committee, the authorities intend to adopt a method of having rapeseed pressed and distributed by the oil pressing industry on behalf of the government, but the rapeseed has not yet arrived, and the date of the committee's establishment has been repeatedly delayed.</p>
<h3>National Bonds and Foreign Stocks Remain Stable</h3>

<h3>Chinese Stocks Fluctuate Narrowly: Market Transactions Are Scarce</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks were volatile yesterday, with market conditions sparse. Some securities traders bought on dips, and prices recovered repeatedly. The opening price of Neiyi fell to the limit, but soon stabilized. Huafeng was also unsupported, but gradually brightened. The Match Company received strong buying from bank traders, and the Mei Ya Company was trading for the last day before the capital increase. Both companies were forced to suspend trading at one point and were the most eye-catching. Mei Ya Silk Factory is implementing a capital increase, and spot and delivery transactions will be temporarily suspended from today.</p>
<p>The market opened lower in the morning due to a strong sense of peace. After the opening of the Diyi Yarn market, traders from No. 231, No. 11, No. 179, No. 94, No. 152, No. 224, No. 205, No. 119, and No. 97 bought in, and the price gradually rose to 680 yuan.

Traders from No. 155, No. 231, and No. 94 continued to sell, and the price failed to advance further. Although the Match Company was listed as rising to the limit by No. 110, Zhongyi Trust, Diyi Yarn was still liquidated by traders from No. 94, No. 153, No. 232, No. 89, and No. 231.

<h3>Cocoon Markets Open Successively in Various Regions</h3>
<p>According to a message released by the Sericulture Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Hangzhou branch reported that as of the 26th, the number of cocoons received by various cocoon merchants was 21,000 dan of local fresh cocoons and 5,000 dan of improved fresh cocoons, totaling 26,000 dan (calculated at a ratio of 1:3 for fresh cocoons to dried cocoon weight). Currently, the number of local varieties is gradually decreasing, while the number of improved varieties is gradually increasing. 147 families in Zhejiang province can all begin weighing today. In the past two days, silkworm farmers in various regions have been enthusiastically selling cocoons, with each merchant receiving an average of 150 dan of fresh cocoons per day. The order in the cocoon market is good, and all are able to comply with the regulations and procedures. Cocoon banknotes have also been rushed to various places by the Agricultural Bank of China to provide assistance, so there is no need to worry about shortages. In addition, the quality of cocoons in various regions is quite good. The discount for green silk is smaller than the 420 jin stipulated by the association. It is estimated that the average conversion rate for improved varieties can be within 400 jin, so the original standard cocoon price can be slightly increased. In Jiangsu province, except for the cocoon merchants in Wujiang and Liyang, who will start weighing in one or two days, the remaining areas of Wuxi, Wujin, and Jiangyin will not start weighing until June 2nd or 3rd. Based on the production situation in various regions, it is feared that 300 billion yuan will be needed to cover the cost of all cocoons.</p>
<h3>Holders Unanimously Seek Higher Prices: Factory Thread Market Shows Improvement; Rayon Is Mediocre, Silk Prices Are Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market lacked the strength to rise and ultimately leveled with the previous day. No. 120, with a high mountain and bright light, opened at 17.2 million yuan. The silk factory traders showed some interest, causing the asking price to rise slowly. The morning close was 7.8 million yuan, 300,000 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, due to the tight money situation, there were those willing to sell at a discount, so the final price was 7.75 million yuan. The price of the Dongyang brand was 600,000 yuan, the same as the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the factory silk market suddenly became enthusiastic. As the price of cocoons in the countryside has increased, and the cost of new silk will also increase, holders unanimously sought higher prices. The transaction price yesterday rose by 1.4 million yuan compared to the previous day. Tongshun bought 15 bales of D-grade thread, with prices ranging from 21.4 million to 600,000 yuan in three levels. There were also transactions in medium-grade thread, with prices around 20 million to 50,000 yuan. The price of high-grade thread was similar to that of D-grade thread. Yesterday, there were more than 30 bales traded in total. Qianjing still lacks buyers, but the asking price was also good yesterday, rising by 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk goods market was very weak in the morning, but the asking price returned to level in the afternoon due to the rising price of silk. Dachang's plaid silk crepe opened at 350,500 yuan, with a minimum price of 200 yuan. There were those who wanted to buy in the afternoon at 500 yuan. Bedding fabric initially cost 100,000 yuan. High-grade goods from Huajin silk crepe were transacted at 13,800 yuan. Although the price is high in the producing area, some people in the Shanghai market are eager to sell due to monetary reasons, and they inevitably sell at a discount. Moreover, the quality of the goods varies greatly, so the market price lacks a standard.</p>
<h3>Cloth Market Weak at First, Then Slightly Better</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened quietly, and sales were also sluggish. The price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth once fell to 288,000-289,000 yuan, and Sijunzi gabardine was 290,000 yuan. However, as Tianjin traders bought up medium and low-grade fine cloth at low prices, and Hankou traders also showed interest in bleached cloth, the market price rose. As a result, the price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 298,000 yuan, an increase of 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Fine cloth such as Wufu Caiqiu also increased by 4,000-5,000 yuan. Gabardine Sijunzi and Jinlian Miaowu increased by 5,000-7,000 yuan. Bleached cloth, colored fine cloth, blue cloth, twill, and straight tribute also saw many increases.</p>

The price of the old brand Phoenix matches fell slightly by 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In the market for soap and candle raw materials, foreign firms sold off quite a bit due to tight credit, the market was flooded with chips, and sentiment was soft. Yuepai caustic soda fell to 7.25 million yuan, and American caustic soda also saw a small decline, to 7 million yuan per barrel. Caustic soda powder fell back by 100 yuan per pound, to 2,400 yuan.

<h3>Domestically Produced Woolen Fabrics Are Popular</h3>
<p>With the difficulty of importing foreign goods, domestically produced woolen fabrics are in demand, and prices continue to rise, setting new records. All large and small woolen fabric manufacturers are thriving and making huge profits. Woolen fabric shops, on the other hand, are in a difficult situation. Foreign firms have mostly suspended operations due to import controls. With the exception of large-scale stores, ordinary shops are feeling the pain of rising costs and high interest rates. The future of their business is fraught with hidden worries.</p>
<h3>Measures for Importing Raw Materials for Export Products to Be Approved Soon: Review Procedures to Be Handled by the Export Association</h3>
<p>[Our Report] A person in charge of the executive committee of the Export Promotion Committee met with reporters yesterday and said: During this trip to Beijing, he had discussions with the competent authorities on measures for importing raw materials for export products and measures to support bulk export materials. The approval of these two measures should not be a problem and will be announced and implemented in the near future.</p>
<p>The measures for importing raw materials for export products have been discussed and approved by both the Export and Import Committees. The review procedures will be handled by the Export Association. As for the issuance of permits, it will be handled by the licensing office. As soon as the government order is issued, it will be followed.</p>
<p>Government Support for Exporters</p>
<p>Regarding measures to support bulk export materials, recently, due to the discrepancy between domestic and foreign market prices for some bulk export materials, and due to the exchange rate, exports will incur losses. All exporters hope that the government will provide assistance. In order to balance international payments, the government cannot ignore these bulk export materials and will do its best to support exports. However, it is best if merchants can export on their own. To date, assistance has been implemented for frozen eggs, silk, and tea. Other products such as tung oil and hog bristles are also being planned.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable, with ups and downs. The association set the price for Peruvian sand sugar at 419,000 yuan at first, then 425,000 yuan, a rebound of 5,000 yuan. Taizhong white sand was 375,000 yuan, down 5,000 yuan, and rebounded to 390,000 yuan in the afternoon. 24 coarse white was 470,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. 3.5-car white was still 430,000 yuan. Shantou green opened at 283,000 yuan, up 3,000 yuan. Xinghua white loosened slightly, opening at 390,000 yuan. Xinghua red was 300,000 yuan to 290,000 yuan, totaling hundreds of baskets. Diaoqing other star opened at 250,000 yuan. In the evening, news came from the Taiwan Sugar Company that it had decided to halve the quota for today's allocation based on the actual amount of the previous period, allocating only two types: 4.5-car white and 20 medium sand white. It is predicted that the market may be slightly tight today.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Sales Remain Stable</h3>
<p>Stir-fried green tea, roasted green tea, pearl orchid, and other green teas have been weaker in Tianjin and Yingkou recently, and the trend is becoming more stable. Although there are inflows and outflows of other varieties, the process is calm and unremarkable. In the foreign traders' tea market, negotiations continue to stall due to disagreements on both sides, and the situation remains quiet. According to industry insiders, Bai Lin black tea, which is popular both domestically and abroad, may arrive in Shanghai soon this year. The selling price is affected by high costs and is likely to reach a peak.</p>
<h3>June Coal Allocation: Various Agencies to Discuss Tomorrow</h3>
<p>[Our Report] According to a person in charge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Coal Management Committee, the coal supply to this region mainly comes from three places: Northeast China, Kailuan, and Taiwan. Currently, the coal supply from Northeast China and Kailuan has been disrupted due to the unstable situation and blocked transportation. The supply relies solely on Taiwan, which is insufficient for distribution. In addition, the price of coal has not been adjusted for a long time, which may affect the supply of coal from various coal mines. Although the coal allocation problem for May has been resolved, there is currently no definite certainty about the coal allocation for June. Therefore, the committee has scheduled a meeting for 2:30 PM on the 30th of this month, convening relevant parties, including the Municipal Government, the Municipal Public Works Bureau, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Garrison Command, the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Junpu Bureau, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau, the Shipping Association, the Logistics Command, and the Naval Headquarters, to jointly discuss the adjustment of the June coal allocation.</p>
<h3>Coarse Yarn Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was stable. Because yarn dealers took advantage of tight money conditions to sell a considerable number of yarn stocks, coupled with the release of ten types of yarn by the Textile Construction Company, there was an abundant supply, and market asking prices once fell. However, as Guangdong traders continued to buy, the prices rebounded. Finally, except for 16-count yarn, which showed a slight rise, 42-count Blue Phoenix continued to fall by 50,000 yuan, and 20-count yarn was stable with no change.</p>
<p>[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhixin ship sailed from Shanghai to Guangzhou the day before yesterday, carrying more than 2,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 386 pieces of cloth. It also carried more than 660 boxes of cigarettes and 6,900 pieces of miscellaneous goods to Guangdong. The Zizhong ship returned to Shanghai from Qinhuangdao the day before yesterday, carrying 9,400 tons of soybeans.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Export of American Goods Set for June 30</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The Sixth District Cotton Textile Association received a letter from Mr. Cologne, Chairman of the Provisional Committee of Cotton Importers, stating: "I have just received a telegram from the American Cotton Transportation Association, please forward the following information to all brokers and Chinese buyers: The Department of Agriculture has repeatedly warned American exporters that the deadline for limiting the shipment of exported goods must not exceed June 30 of this year, and the law will not be extended. In this situation, in order to comply with the Department's limit, it is advisable to quickly settle all payments before the end of June so that exporters can load as scheduled, and loading requires at least 30 days of preparation time. If the payment is delayed, the congestion during loading will inevitably result in penalties from the Department of Agriculture." This matter is extremely important and should be promptly communicated to all committees.</p>

<h3>Large Fraud Case of 800,000 Hong Kong Dollars - Manager of Hong Kong Wing Hing Foreign Firm Disappears, "Order Slip Bandits" Gradually Vanish</h3>
<p>— Hong Kong, 24th Dispatch, Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>"Order Slip Bandits" Rampant for a Time</p>
<p>Hong Kong exhibits a deformed prosperity, while also being full of deception and terror.</p>
<p>The most troublesome are the widespread threatening letters, with newspapers reporting "order slips" almost daily. The names used in the "order slips" are uniformly "Overseas Youth Action Faction." Major hotels, theaters, shipping companies, and restaurants have almost all received this type of "order slip" letter. The Kam Cheng Restaurant, Luk Hoi Tung Grand Hotel, Dak Wan Teahouse, New World Theatre, and the "Guangdong" ship have all been bombed by the "Overseas Youth Faction" and suffered considerable losses. For a time, everyone spoke of the "Overseas Youth Faction's" "actions" with fear. The police authorities worked hard to arrest them, and many have been caught. Taking the arrested "order slip" bandit Hong Wenfeng as an example, he sent forty-six threatening letters at once. Judges are not hesitant to use severe punishments, with the heaviest being twelve years of hard labor and twelve lashes of the rattan. As a result, the "order slip bandits" have gradually disappeared and are not as prominent as before.</p>
<p>The city is sinful. Hong Kong's population is increasing daily, making it difficult to make a living, so there are more criminals. In addition to the "order slip" bandits mentioned above, the bizarre and fantastic scams are countless.</p>
<p>"Smart People" Are After All Confused</p>
<p>Around 1:00 PM on the 15th, a woman of about 27 or 28 years old walked into the most modern "Wiseman" restaurant on Des Voeux Road. She was wearing a white-bottomed striped dress, white suede high heels, a diamond ring, and carrying a Western newspaper. She reserved 170 Western meals with the manager, saying they were for a farewell party for the Governor of Hong Kong. The party would be seated at 6:00 PM the next day. Seeing the woman's demeanor, the manager naturally provided diligent service. He immediately agreed on the menu and even used a bowl of curry chicken rice himself. After eating, she ordered 30 roast ducks, 170 catties of large shrimp, 8 turkeys, 200 oranges, 200 apples, 100 mangoes, and 50 pounds of raisins. The manager asked her to pay a deposit of 10,000 yuan. She opened her handbag, took out several 500-yuan bills, and said she didn't have enough money with her, promising to go to the bank to get it later. The manager believed her without a doubt. Before leaving, the woman took away two roast chickens, a bottle of whiskey, half a dozen sandwiches, and half a dozen beers, saying she would pay for them later. She also borrowed 40 yuan from the manager because she didn't have any change for the taxi. The manager lent it to her. Unexpectedly, the woman disappeared without a trace. The manager then realized he had been deceived, resulting in a loss of 105 yuan. It was truly an unprecedented and amusing scam. "Wiseman" is translated as "smart person," but this "smart person" was confused for a moment!</p>
<p>Large Fraud Case, Principal Culprit at Large</p>
<p>The recent large fraud case that shook all of Hong Kong is even more shocking, with the amount defrauded reaching as much as 800,000 Hong Kong dollars. Twenty-one commercial firms were defrauded, making it an unprecedented large-scale scam in the Hong Kong business scene. The protagonist is Ou Jiaxue, the manager of Wing Hing Foreign Firm. His office had two locations: one at 12 Stanley Street and one at Queen's Road Central. Recently, burlap sacks were in high demand and difficult to order. Wing Hing Foreign Firm advertised that it had close ties with Indian merchants and could accept orders. One after another, twenty-one commercial firms made contracts with him, ordering a total of 1,726,000 burlap sacks, with a total value of 4 million Hong Kong dollars. After receiving 20% as a deposit, Ou Jiaxue had 800,000 Hong Kong dollars in hand. Unexpectedly, Ou suddenly disappeared on May 19, and this large fraud case was revealed. A great commotion immediately erupted in the business community. The police have now issued an arrest warrant for Ou to bring him to justice. The victimized commercial firms have formed a "Wing Hing Foreign Firm Creditors' Group" to formally pursue legal action. According to the reporter's investigation, the largest loss was suffered by Da Ji Trading Company, which paid a deposit of 100,000 yuan, while others lost 30,000 to 50,000 yuan each. The inside story of this complex and confusing scam is still a mystery, but merchants have since become very wary of ordering goods!</p>
<h3>Cruel Wolves Fiercely Attack a Lonely Sheep - Blood and Tears in Anyang</h3>
<p>— Zhengzhou, 11th Dispatch, Our Newspaper Correspondent Fan Shiqin</p>
<p>The situation in Henan Province is very clear to the people of the country: Wan is not as good as Luo, and Luo is not as good as Zhang. Wan is Nanyang, Luo is Luoyang, and Zhang is Zhangde, which is Anyang. This shows how strategically important Anyang is. The deliberate siege by "One-Eyed Dragon" Liu Bocheng has been going on for more than a day. Following this, the heroic defense of the loyal and brave National Army!</p>
<p>This time, the National Army withdrew from Tangyin, making Anyang City even more isolated. This tragic situation is like a person losing their only comrade in adversity. The ferocity of a wolf towards a lonely sheep is doubled, otherwise, the world would not have the word "cruel."</p>
<p>Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the railways have been destroyed by the Ba Lu Jun. People returning home to the north were blocked in Anyang. Later, they stayed there due to livelihood reasons, so there are still refugees from distant villages (including those from the Northeast) to this day. Other refugees were driven out of nearby provinces and counties by the Communist army's struggle sessions. Representatives from Anyang seeking aid said: "If we can give each refugee two liang of millet a day, we will be worthy of them."</p>
<p>Zhang Shiji, the speaker of the Anyang City Council, and Wang Maosheng, the deputy speaker, are both elders with high morals and prestige who have been living in seclusion for twenty years and whose descendants are all over northern Henan. After the city was surrounded, they organized a Pacification Promotion Association. The people in the city, regardless of age, had to do construction work. Everyone did construction work. The things in the city, whether public or private, that could be used were all taken out. They shared difficulties and dangers together, truly embodying the saying "sharing the same boat."</p>
<p>Li Tietou (i.e., Li Zhenqing), the famous commander of the 41st Division, and Huochetou (i.e., Zhao Zhichen), the famous former commissioner, are responsible for leading the people to defend the city. Li said to the people: "The soldiers defending the city regard Anyang as their hometown. They would rather lose their lives than lose their hometown." Since being besieged on April 8, Anyang has remained standing because of these brave men.</p>
<p>Defending a lonely city is certainly a tragic thing, and besieging a lonely city is also a tragic thing. This time, when Liu Bocheng besieged Tangyin, he should have known that there were things he couldn't bear to do. One night, a Communist army regiment commander forced his soldiers to charge with machine guns. Those soldiers charged again and again, seeing batches of civilians fall. Seeing this, the soldiers couldn't bear it. Holding their machine guns, they turned around and knelt in front of their regiment commander, pleading: "We can't fight anymore. Too many civilians are dying!" That night, the regiment commander ordered a temporary halt to the attack. The next morning, the regiment commander was found hanged in the woods.</p>

<p>A Monk Also Voices a Call</p>
<p>Editor: We are a group of neglected and oppressed people in society because we are monks. Few people pay attention to our class. Here, I must declare in advance that although monks are said to be detached from worldly desires, that is just a religious theory. When we are hungry, we need to eat; when we are cold, we need to wear clothes. This is the reality. Living in the real world, we have to abandon theory and study the current reality. We live in the degenerate age of Buddhism. The collective monastic practice system established by monks in the past has now lost its function. Especially in Shanghai, 100% of the temples rely on performing Buddhist services to make a living. Therefore, we are a group of monks who chant scriptures and perform repentance ceremonies for temples. We chant until our voices are hoarse from 8:00 AM to 4:00 or 5:00 PM, but the "single salary" we receive is only 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. At the end of last year, the price of public bonds in various monasteries (i.e., each temple) was 8,000 yuan, and we were receiving 3,000 yuan. In March of this year, they still asked for 12,000 yuan per person, and we still got what we got. Recently, prices have skyrocketed, and these meager incomes are really not enough for daily needs. The Buddhist Association has a resolution that the single salary of the monastic community should be calculated according to 30%, but each temple does not raise the price, which is like drawing cakes to satisfy hunger. Therefore, in great disappointment, we convened a meeting of representatives from various monastic communities and voluntarily agreed to set the single salary at 6,000 yuan (i.e., 6,000 yuan for one day of performing services). In the feudal minds of the abbots of various temples, they consider us rebellious for daring to set the price ourselves. Therefore, many temple abbots have announced that anyone who dares to mention raising the "single salary" will be "expelled" (a monastic term meaning to be kicked out). The single salary we have set this time is already extremely low compared to the general standards of society. Because we are all single, we cannot be compared with other classes. But even this extremely low demand cannot get their sympathy. They can arbitrarily ask the believers for any amount for a Buddhist service, plus income from vegetarian offerings. Our single salary is like a leaf in the ocean. They ignore that we are all Buddhists and forget the ancient saying of "crossing the river in the same boat." They only care about selfishness and how to exploit the masses? If there is still justice in the world, I don't know how these Buddhist magnates should be punished. We are the oppressed and weak. We cannot compete with these elders in terms of money and power. We can only appeal to fair-minded people in society and the media to sympathize with and help us. (Yi Yi Monk)</p>
<h3>Interlude of the Spring Tea Harvest in Western Anhui</h3>
<p>— Hefei, 15th Dispatch, Our Newspaper Correspondent Bai Ping</p>
<p>From Lu'an to Mabao, the roadsides are lined with lush green wheat fields. After traveling twenty li, wheat fields are less common. Instead, there are clusters of low, green tea trees. Looking into the distance, there are also scattered clusters of tea. After familiarizing myself with the tea-growing area, I realized that facing the tea clusters covering the mountains and fields also means facing countless problems in the tea-growing area.</p>
<p>In the mountains of western Anhui, the peaks are overlapping and there is very little farmland. Residents can only "rely on the mountains for a living." Tea planting is not only their main sideline but also the source of life in the mountainous area. The success or failure of each year's spring tea harvest has a huge impact on their entire rural economy. Because their livelihoods depend so heavily on tea, they are usually called tea farmers. Mongolians use the number of cattle and sheep to indicate their wealth, while tea farmers in western Anhui determine their wealth by the number of tea clusters. A rich farmer not only owns many bamboo forests that do not require much labor to cultivate but, more importantly, has several good tea mountains. The poor are different. Those who have mountains have barren land that produces little. Those who rent other people's mountains also mostly rent barren mountains. They also have to take out some of the tea they grow to pay the landlord, which is the duty of tenants.</p>
<p>The lives of tea farmers in western Anhui are on the brink of starvation. Their only enjoyment is the fresh air and unrestrained singing in the green mountains.</p>
<p>Human or Bird? A Tragic Story</p>
<p>Is a touching story that every tea farmer can tell.</p>
<p>Every year, when the tea trees are lush all over the mountains, there is a sharp, crisp, and sorrowful bird sound that echoes in the mountain valleys at night. "Yang Kuiliu," "Yang Kuiliu," the tea farmers recognize that this night bird is calling out tirelessly.</p>
<p>It is said that, in an unknown year, there was an old tea merchant named Yang Kuiliu from outside the mountains who would come to the Pi River area to buy tea every spring. This year, after buying the tea, he loaded it onto a wooden boat and went down the Pi River. For some reason, he tragically drowned in the Pi River. His wife waited for her husband to return every day. However, day after day, month after month, year after year, she never saw the husband she missed. Later, she learned that her husband had been buried in the belly of a fish a long time ago. She was extremely saddened and soon died in depression. But her soul did not disappear. In order to cherish her husband, she turned into a small bird. Every spring, she would fly to the tea-growing area to look for her husband all over the mountains and fields, calling out her husband's name "Yang Kuiliu" sadly. After listening for a long time, the tea farmers called this bird "Yang Kuiliu." Thus, a person's name became a bird's name. Tea farmers often tell this story.</p>
<p>This story is a myth. The longer it is passed down, the more mysterious it becomes. Tea farmers use the volume of "Yang Kuiliu" sounds each year to predict the success or failure of the spring tea harvest. This year, the sound of "Yang Kuiliu" is not very loud. The tea farmers say that this year's spring tea harvest is only average.</p>
<p>Tea-Picking Mountain Songs Are Beautiful Poems</p>
<p>The season when "Yang Kuiliu" calls out all over the mountains and the azaleas are as red as fire is the time when spring tea arrives, which is also the busiest time for tea farmers.</p>
<p>The tea-picking season is still based on the old "Farmers' Almanac." "No picking after Grain Rain, no stopping picking after Qingming." Tea picked before the Rain Water season is called "small tea." Tea picked after the Grain in Ear season is called "large tea." "Large tea" has the highest yield.</p>
<p>During tea-picking, men and women, young and old, carry baskets on their backs, some even bring small wooden stools, and scatter around the low tea trees. With their hands moving, the tea leaves fall rustling into the baskets. Tea-picking also requires skill. The best tea-pickers can pick one to one and a half catties of "small tea" every day. Poor ones can only pick half a catty. When picking "large tea," because the tea trees have grown completely and the leaves have grown well, each person can pick six or seven catties every day.</p>
<p>Young men and women are more active when picking tea, as if spring belongs to them. In the warm sunlight, they use mountain songs to relieve the pain of material life and the fatigue of work. They sing to each other, and naturally many of the lyrics are lewd, but many are simple and lovely, revealing true feelings. We can say that those mountain songs are simple peasant literature, they are beautiful poems.</p>
<p>Mountain songs in western Anhui are usually five lines. Listening to them sing, the melody is very consistent with the principles of music, and the mood is happy and emotional. The reporter has selected and recorded three songs as follows:</p>
<p>"Looking at the good sister wearing cyan blue, carrying a small bamboo basket in her hand, I ask the good sister where are you going? The husband is poor and the family is difficult, making bitter vegetables for dinner."</p>
<p>"Seventeen or eighteen, a flower on a branch, if you don't marry a man, when will you? The moon is full on the fifteenth, the time is short in youth, people reach middle age and everything stops, the water flows to the East Sea and never returns."</p>
<p>"The orchid grass flower smells fragrant, the rapeseed flower shines yellow, compare the two flowers, home flowers are not as fragrant as wild flowers, the home man is not as strong as the wild man."</p>
<p>There are also realistic mountain songs that men and women sing to each other.</p>
<p>The man sings: "The small tea tree squats low, holding the tea tree and sighing, picking tea all day until night, frying tea until the fifth watch, and no money to return home."</p>
<p>The woman sings: "Sister tells her dear brother not to worry, I will handle your travel expenses, you can pawn hairpins and jewelry, the slave will choose dry tea for you, carrying a painted eyebrow bird, swaying home."</p>
<p>From these few mountain songs, the hardships of the tea farmers' lives and the love between men and women can be imagined.</p>
<p>Carrying the Burden, Enduring Long Years</p>
<p>Once the spring tea season begins, all the manpower of the tea farmers' families is concentrated on tea. Before that, they must prepare, such as building tea pots, tying bamboo silk handles for frying tea, yellow flower handles, tea picking baskets, cloth pockets for selling tea, and tea baskets for loading and drying tea. When the tea picking comes, they pick tea non-stop in the tea garden during the day and fry it at night to prepare for sale tomorrow. As the mountain song says, "Picking tea all day until night, frying tea until the fifth watch," they are exhausted.</p>
<p>From the autumn season of the first year, they engage in cultivation, weeding, transplanting, merging, pruning, and other work on the tea, until the spring of the second year when they pick, dry, and sell it. A lot of labor is spent in between. However, the price they get for their labor is hunger and cold. They endure long years in an environment of poverty and sorrow all year round!</p>
<p>This year's tea price was very high when it first came on the market, at 24,000 yuan per catty. But because it was just trying out the new tea, the good times didn't last long. Soon it fell to a miserable 8,000 yuan per catty. When the reporter arrived in the tea-growing area, it was the time when the national rice price began to fluctuate. The tea price followed the rice price, rising to 12,000 to 13,000 yuan per catty. Although the tea price had improved, the tea farmers were not better off than last year. Western Anhui is short of rice, and the tea farmers sell tea to buy rice. At this time last year, one catty of tea could be exchanged for one dou and four or five sheng of rice. This year, when the reporter was in Mabao, the price of rice had risen to 150,000 to 160,000 yuan per shi. One catty of tea can't buy any rice. Moreover, when selling tea, they have to bear very heavy taxes. Tea is one of the largest sources of income in the special product tax. For example, the budget of Lihuang County almost entirely relies on the support of the special product tax. Tea farmers have to pay 10% special product tax for selling one catty of tea, and the tea merchants also take 3% commission. The tea farmers receive only 8,700 yuan for every 10,000 yuan they earn. This puts a heavy burden on the tea farmers, and the land tax, conscription, Baojia, assessments, and other counties have the same burden.</p>
<p>Sometimes, tea farmers are also exploited by tea merchants. Tea farmers always sell wet tea. They carry it on their shoulders for dozens of li of mountain roads to reach the tea merchants, and they are waiting for money to buy rice or cloth. Moreover, wet tea will rot in two days, so it must be sold. This gives the tea merchants an opportunity. Cunning tea merchants see this and deliberately suppress the price. Yes, it's better not to buy it, but it's better not to sell it. So the tea farmers know they are at a loss, and they have to reluctantly sell the goods for money!</p>
<p>Year After Year The government did not do anything to tea farmers</p>
<p>To be fair, the government has paid attention to tea farmers. Every spring, the government has sent officials to tea-growing counties in western Anhui to issue tea loans. The amount of the loan is allocated according to the number of cooperative members. However, the tea loans are given to a few people year after year. These few people are the tea merchants who specialize in studying banknotes. Whenever they hear about the distribution of tea loans, they make up many names and become a cooperative. When the loan is in hand, they not only don't use it to buy tea but also lend it out for profit. Some tea farmers are instead exploited by them. The government originally hoped that the money would benefit the farmers, but the effect is the opposite.</p>
<p>This year, the total amount of tea loans in western Anhui is 250 million yuan, which is issued by the Agricultural Bank. Perhaps the Agricultural Bank knows about past abuses, so this year the Agricultural Bank is organizing a working team to issue loans themselves. The Social Affairs Office of the Provincial Government has also organized a tea cooperative working team to cooperate in handling the matter. The reporter has met them in Lu'an, Mabao, and other places. This year, they should be able to correct past abuses. The reporter wishes the tea farmers well!</p>

<h3>A Brand New World Atlas</h3>
<p>— Shen Xiuzhi</p>
<p>Hammond's New International World Atlas Published in 1947 Price 55,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Hammond's New International World Atlas is a brand new atlas published after World War II, and it is an indispensable tool for those who study modern geography.</p>
<p>This atlas is divided into three parts. The first part mainly consists of thirty-nine "World Political Maps," which, except for the first "World Map," are arranged in the order of continents. (1) North America and South America, including maps of Canada and Newfoundland, the United States, Mexico, Central American countries, the West Indies, Northern South America, Southern South America, and Central South America. (2) Europe, including maps of the United Kingdom and Ireland, Spain and Portugal, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, Italy, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the Balkan Peninsula, Poland, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark, the Soviet Union (European part), and others. (3) Asia, including maps of Turkey, Syria and Lebanon, Palestine and Transjordan, Iran and Iraq, Arabia, India, Ceylon, Burma, Siam, Vietnam and Malaya, the East Indies, China and Japan, the Soviet Union (Asian part), Japan and Korea, New Zealand, Pacific Islands, and others. (4) Australia. (5) Africa, divided into North Africa and South Africa.</p>
<p>The second part consists of several supplementary items: (1) The aftermath of World War II. This is a short article explaining the changes in the borders of countries in Europe, Asia, and Africa after World War II, based on treaties, surrender terms, and other agreements. (2) World Gazetteer, divided into country names, areas, populations, capitals or major cities, map numbers, and locations. (3) Important locations of World War II, divided into Europe and North Africa, and Asia and the Pacific. (4) World Statistics, regarding the heights, lengths, and areas of the world's high mountains, major rivers, oceans, and large lakes. (5) Topography and Resource Distribution Maps, indicating the topography and distribution of important minerals and agricultural products of each continent.</p>
<p>The second part is "Illustrated World Geography," which "describes the natural resources, topographical features, industries, occupations, and cultural backgrounds of various countries in the world." It uses text and photographs for explanation, and the order is the same as the maps, starting with North America. However, the classification here is more detailed, with each country as a unit. The text explanations are concise, with no other special features, but the photographs and illustrations are beautiful and well-selected. They allow us to see the fishing villages of Nova Scotia in Canada, the Spanish-style churches in Mexico, the "fiber boats" on Lake Titicaca in Ecuador, the medieval fortresses of France, the snowy landscapes of Finland, the heroic appearance of New Turkey, the scenery of the North African desert, and the flocks of sheep in Australia.</p>
<p>The third part is historical maps, including forty-five maps, with concise explanations. These historical maps can help us read about Europe and the United States. They allow us to understand the rise of ancient empires in the Near East, the vast territory of the Persian Empire, and the rise and fall of ancient Greek and Roman culture. They take us to medieval Europe, allowing us to witness the barbarian invasions, the Crusades, the rise of the Mongol Empire, and the feudal era in Europe. Then we enter modern times, and we see the voyages of discovery to the Americas from 1492 to 1611, Italy during the Renaissance, Europe in 1559, Europe in 1763, the partitions of Poland, Central Europe in 1812, Europe from the Congress of Vienna to 1839, the unification of Italy, Europe in 1914, and Europe from 1919 to 1938. Regarding the American part, there are also several maps, namely the birth of the United States, the expansion of American territory, the distribution of the American slavery system from 1775 to 1865, and the United States at the beginning of the Civil War in 1861.</p>
<h3>Introducing "The Electric World"</h3>
<p>— Yang Shi</p>
<p>Edited by Qiu Weiyu Published by the Science Instrument Company</p>
<p>In the publishing world, there are more than a dozen general science publications, but the "Electric World" monthly magazine, published by the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineers, is the only magazine that specifically discusses electrical science and electrical engineering. Electricity—one of mankind's most faithful servants—has a bit of mystery. The minuteness of electrons is unimaginable, and the wonder of radio surpasses the imagination of ordinary people. It is a great source of power. The smallest particle of matter is the atom, but the interior of the atom is still filled with unequal numbers of electrons orbiting. Therefore, this is indeed an authentic "Electric World."</p>
<p>In terms of arrangement and material selection, equal emphasis is placed on special articles and reports, and they are rigorous and accessible, with a level of depth suitable for university science and engineering students. The "Forum" column is written by well-known domestic professors, who not only report their research findings, but more importantly, systematically introduce new things from abroad to the Chinese people. In terms of engineering, China's electrical engineering is progressing faster than any other field, and electrical undertakings are also rising in various places. This publication has a plan to collect reports from various places in the country and provide them to students and young people who are fascinated by science.</p>
<p>Radio experiments are the most interesting and convenient. A few strands of electric wire, a few vacuum tubes, and a couple of batteries can be combined into a radio receiver. Many other small experiments can inspire people's thinking and increase their interest in learning. Therefore, there is a "Laboratory" to help you make these experiments. "Knowing is difficult, doing is easy" is the best example used in this regard. Experiments are easy, but the principles behind them are profound. Perhaps countless mathematical equations cannot explain a very small experiment. In the "Readers' Correspondence" column, there are many professors who specialize in answering readers' spontaneous questions. The effectiveness of obtaining answers to questions raised by oneself is greater than that of lectures given by teachers in the classroom.</p>
<p>Up to now, there are very few university textbooks on science and engineering written in our own language, and some have different translations or are translated in a way that is more profound and difficult to understand. Therefore, textbooks and reference books for science and engineering colleges are simply written in the original language, which is a discount on effectiveness, and makes it even more difficult for self-taught science youth to encounter problems in learning tools (language) first. In addition to using smooth Chinese to explain these profound questions, "Electric World" also has many illustrations to help understanding. Indeed, this is a rare electrical engineering magazine.</p>
<p>In some aspects, "Electric World" has shortcomings. For example, the target audience could be expanded to include middle schools, and it is hoped that there will be some simpler articles in the special discussions. In order to make it easier for readers to read, more illustrations should be added, and more interesting electrical engineering knowledge should be added. In addition, the current situation of domestic and foreign science and engineering colleges regarding electrical engineering can also be systematically introduced, which would make it more perfect.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Life and Thought</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Edited by Xia Ping Published by Vitality Publishing House</p>
<p>President Roosevelt, this generation's great man, passed away more than a year ago. The fascists, whom he deeply abhorred during his lifetime, have all fallen one by one. The "world peace," "Atlantic Charter," and the "Four Freedoms" of the person, which he actively promoted during his lifetime, are still being vigorously pursued and promoted by peace-loving and democratic people around the world today. In the year after his death, the world has changed dramatically. Although World War II has ended, those who are superstitious about force are dreaming of a new world war. Although world peace has been realized, there is still this place of war... Looking back today, it is not a meaningless thing to browse through the life of this human democratic mentor!</p>
<p>President Roosevelt came from a distinguished family and received a good family education from an early age. In his childhood, he showed his fairness, frankness, and the spirit of moving forward courageously and never slacking off. Although he did not experience difficult times, he held an attitude of distrust towards the current people, but sympathized with the laboring masses. Outside the political sphere, his personality made both his friends and enemies feel undeniable.</p>
<p>When the President was studying at Harvard University, he became interested in politics. In 1910, he participated in the election for New York State Senator and was elected as a Democratic Senator the following year. After that, relying on his extensive knowledge, far-sighted vision, and great fearless fighting spirit, he had a smooth sailing in the American political arena. In 1912, he served as the Governor of New York State, and the following year, he became the Undersecretary of the Navy, making great contributions to the Allied countries during World War I. 1921 was the most memorable day in President Roosevelt's life. He contracted polio and fought the disease for three full years, finally recovering to his previous state. The author wrote in the book: "In the position of ordinary people, after such a long period of illness, they must complain very much, or their spirits will be declining..." (page 60 of the original book). If this were the case, they would bury their own future, "but Roosevelt did not do this."</p>
<p>When he was elected president in 1932, the United States was in a crisis of extreme economic panic. He finally saved the country with his New Deal. At that time, although there were enemies who made things difficult for him everywhere, he was "an extraordinary great man who, with his unique ability and moving sincerity, ultimately defeated his political enemies, and the opposition had to express their heartfelt submission to him. It is no accident that Roosevelt was able to create the record of being elected president three times in a row in American history.</p>
<p>One-third of the book is devoted to Roosevelt's contribution of his greatest strength in World War II, contributing to a series of brilliant victories for the United Nations, but it is a pity that he unfortunately passed away before the final victory. The American people and the United Nations therefore lost this leader of the democratic struggle and the promoter of building peace and security after the war.</p>
<p>In the chapter "Roosevelt's Personality," there is a good explanation of his style and demeanor. Everyone who wants to understand him and learn from his character should read it carefully several times.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that President Roosevelt was a great statesman. The last chapter of this book points out his great contributions to modern humanity, especially his great contributions to international security and peaceful relations between countries after the war, which are unparalleled by anyone.</p>
<p>From this book, we can see the personality record and life microcosm of this contemporary great man. Roosevelt's decisiveness, courage, and always forward-looking attitude and spirit are worthy of our learning. Who will continue the unfinished business he left behind?</p>
<h3>Cultivation of Children's Personality</h3>
<p>— Nian Hong</p>
<p>Written by Wansiers Translated by Yi Wenshan Printed by Zhengzhong Book Company</p>
<p>The importance of children's education is well known to the public. Therefore, although there are not many books on children's education on the market, there are indeed several books with rich content that can be used as a reference for general researchers of children's psychology and children's education workers. However, it is rare to see complete books that are relatively practical and not too boring for ordinary parents and teachers to read. Although this book still has many shortcomings, generally speaking, it is still a good read.</p>
<p>Rather than saying that this book is about cultivating children's personality, it is more broadly speaking an overview of all children's education methods (except for specialized intelligence training). It has a very detailed exposition on children's physiology, environmental influences, and various characteristics of children. However, precisely because it is too detailed, some places in this book seem too trivial. Especially in the first few chapters on clothing, posture, and physiology, it is often difficult for people to generate a clear concept after reading. This is a common shortcoming of educational theory books, and this book regrettably also has this small flaw.</p>
<p>The best written (meaning the most suitable for ordinary parents and teachers to read) two chapters are also the focus of this book—namely, the comfort of the family and self-reliance and personality. It clearly points out several extremely important points that are often overlooked by ordinary teachers and parents, and discusses them in detail. For example, children have a habit of liking to be with adults, and like to hear what adults are talking about and doing. However, ordinary adults are often not happy to let children know too much. In Chinese society, you can often hear words like "Adults are talking, children go away." Of course, there are many things that may have a negative impact on children, so it is natural not to let children know. However, this kind of behavior often fosters psychological inferiority in children, making them afraid of any social activities in their youth. This is one of the reasons why so-called young people are too shy and unaccustomed to social habits. For example, many parents are always unwilling to let children do too many things. In fact, when children's physiological development is able to cope, the help they ask for from their parents gradually decreases. However, because parents have the habit of helping them, they want to help them more and more. Some parents even spoon-feed three- or five-year-old children without teaching them how to hold chopsticks, dress, or wash their hands. These will hinder the cultivation and development of children's ability to take care of themselves. In the two chapters on children's self-reliance and family comfort, there are seventy or eighty important precautions listed, and they are discussed and studied item by item. Many of them are indeed extremely important but extremely ordinary experiences that are overlooked. After the author refers to the basis of simple educational theory, it feels even more that what he said is realistic and accurate.</p>
<p>However, compared with this book and another work by the author, "Modern Parents," it seems to be slightly inferior in terms of translation and the realism of the content. Perhaps it is because the translator used a direct translation and the national conditions and habits of China and the United States are different. Some places often do not seem very suitable and fluent to read. Strictly speaking, this should also be a flaw.</p>
<h3>"I Choose Freedom"</h3>
<p>— Guang Jian</p>
<p>(I Choose Freedom V Kravchenco)</p>
<p>Translated by Yun Wen (May 1947) Published by Independence Publishing House</p>
<p>Last year, this edition introduced the English version of this book. I think the readers who saw that introduction at the time must have hoped that a Chinese version would be published and come out as soon as possible, so that it could be widely circulated and everyone would have the opportunity to read it.</p>
<p>Now, the first Chinese version of this book has been translated by Mr. Yun Wen and has been published by Independence Publishing House. It was a fad in the United States, with many discussions. In China, at least it is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>This book is a passionate biography. The author, Victor Kravchenko, is a typical figure of loyalty and purity. In order to realize "freedom and equality," he joined the Communist Party, believing that by becoming a Communist Party member, he could repay the Soviet Union and benefit the suffering people. However, the Communist Party's facilities are dark; the Communist Party's rule is cold-blooded; the Communist Party officials fundamentally ignore the interests of the people and do their best to exploit and enslave them. Driven by his conscience, after experiencing countless cold-blooded blows, he finally broke away from the Communist Party and became a stateless vagrant. Before his departure, he was serving as the deputy head of the Soviet Purchasing Mission in the United States, a position that can be said to be quite high, but due to mental distress, his determination to leave the Communist Party did not waver.</p>
<p>This book begins with the Great Revolution of 1905 and ends with the Soviet Union's involvement in the whirlpool of World War II. Kravchenko faithfully depicts the whole story of the penetration of socialism in the Soviet Union. He exposes the iron facts: hunger, exploitation, and enslavement. "Socialism, to put it appropriately, is better called robbery." (The words of the farmers in the collective farms) For daring to help countless dying little people in violation of party orders, he was purged. This is a fact, and as far as we know, his views have been scolded by some people, but the facts have not been denied.</p>
<p>We must read this book in order to understand the real situation in the Soviet Union. At a time when society is unstable and people's hearts are extremely distressed, those who are still willing to know and compare various social systems, in particular, must read this book. After reading this book, we can increase some knowledge and understanding of the modern world or society.</p>
<p>The translator has many translations, and this book is one of them. When translating this book, the translator spent a great deal of meticulous effort, not only striving to conform to the original meaning in every word, sentence, and paragraph, but also expressing the meaning revealed between the lines very profoundly. As for the fluency of the translation and its literary interest, it is something that goes without saying. It is hoped that young friends who are dissatisfied with the reality and dream of another ideal can read it quickly.</p>
<h3>Trends in Russian Literature</h3>
<p>— Xu Peiji</p>
<p>Original by Mikawa Masao Translated by Ren Jun Published by Zhengzhong Book Company</p>
<p>Under the orange-yellow lamplight of dusk, I quietly finished reading "Trends in Russian Literature," and my thoughts traveled through a vast plain full of fragrant flowers and exotic fruits.</p>
<p>Although my journey of the soul was hurried and fleeting; although I could only appreciate the neat rows of flowers and fruits laid out on the surface, in the joyful leaps, the overall picture of the colorful plain that I captured forever tempted me to fall into the dense flower and fruit business in the sky I was looking at, and go deep in a roundabout way.</p>
<p>Russian literature, from the era of sentimentalism, established a sincere attitude towards life, and until the establishment of Proletarian literature, the ideology of the old era's literature has completely changed. This hard-won journey of history has made Russian literature occupy a very high position in the world's literary world, emitting its unique brilliance.</p>
<p>The author of this book uses meticulous brushstrokes to point out the traces of literary historical development from a vertical perspective, and from a horizontal perspective, he concisely and succinctly lists the literary giants who illuminate the traces, and how amazing and admirable are their inherent qualities and outward brilliance!</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into nineteen chapters: (1) The Age of Sentimentalism (2) The Age of Romanticism (3) Pushkin (4) Forerunners of Realism (5) Lermontov (6) Gogol (7) The Forties, the Victory of Realism (8) Turgenev (9) The Sixties, Before and After the Emancipation of the Serfs (10) Dostoevsky (11) Tolstoy (12) The Great Achievement of National Drama (13) The Seventies, From Hope to Disillusionment (14) The Eighties, Chekhov (15) The Nineties, Gorky (16) Modernist Literature (17) A Glimpse of Modern Poetry (18) Fellow Travelers Literature (19) Proletarian Literature. In these chapters, we can see that the author sometimes uses the characteristics of the era to measure the achievements of the literary figures of that era, and sometimes uses the giant image of a literary figure to represent the style of the entire era. The consistent and orderly narrative: readers can easily find the clues of the mutual influence between "era" and "literary figures."</p>
<p>The impression that Russian literature leaves on the general public is that it is a dark and melancholy literature, a literature with a strong spirit of resistance and revolution, or a literature with a very obvious religious color, and these impressions seem to have become concrete common sense. Sure enough, these observations are not without merit, but they cannot grasp the true essence of Russian literature. The most fundamental characteristic of Russian literature is a sincere energy that is unwilling to only live in another independent world of literature, to stick to the position of pure art of observing and reproducing life phenomena, but to constantly engage in desperate, bloody struggles in order to solve practical life problems, practical social problems, and improve human life. To summarize in a simple sentence, the fundamental characteristic of Russian literature is the spirit of serving society and the tendency of social education. Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, as well as many other Russian literary giants, have all used literature as a method of social education, and have tried hard to establish a social religion through literature. This characteristic is a powerful factor promoting the evolution of Russian literary trends, and the author has a very detailed discussion of this issue in the book.</p>
<p>Because Russian literature has this fundamental characteristic, it presents a completely different posture compared with Western European literature. In Western Europe, various forms of expression still exist in social life outside of literature, but in Russia, which is almost uncultured in cultural life, which is almost uncultured, literature is the only method to express ideas and self-expression. The direction of expression of literature produced in the country of serfs and landlords is pointed out by the author in the preface with the following characteristics:</p>
<p>"First, the love for nature is particularly profound. Second, the narrative form is simple and unpretentious, completely without any feeling of gaudiness, splendor, etc., and sometimes, it even gives people a rigorous impression. Third, the spirit of endlessly immersing in moral and religious problems and exploring its truth is extremely prosperous and persistent... etc." "Is this the art of barbarians? Or is it the literature of saints?" A Western European critic's cry of doubt is just right to find an appropriate answer in this book.</p>
<p>If literature is the soul of a nation or country, or literature is a specific reflection of the state or era's ideology, then the driving force of pursuing truth, enthusiasm, sincerity, and uncompromisingness flowing through Russian literature can help us further understand the inner essence of the giant squatting in the north of our country.</p>
<p>Since the New Literature Movement occurred in our country, the works of Russian writers have been continuously translated, directly and indirectly giving the Chinese literary world a decisive influence.</p>
<p>Young people who love Russian literature disorderly absorb these nutritious foods, but they all suffer from the inability to consistently adjust the taste, then this book has the function of supplementing these defects. In the Chinese literary world, which has not yet systematically introduced Russian literary history, and in the impoverished and barren Chinese publishing world, this book is indeed worthy of rereading and recommendation.</p>

<h3>The Chaos of Greece</h3>
<p>— Translated by Meng Lin</p>
<p>Since March 12, when U.S. President Truman requested loans from Congress to aid Greece, this ancient nation has been the focus of world attention.</p>
<p>Greece is currently the only country in Europe where the left and right factions are openly fighting. In its appeal to the United Nations last year, it complained that its three communist neighbors—Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria—were providing assistance to the guerrillas in its northern mountains. In reality, hasn't the government, or rather the royalists, also received foreign aid? British troops are stationed within its borders, training the government army, wearing British-made uniforms, and using British weapons. Now, with the addition of American aid, it is practically a second Spanish Civil War!</p>
<p>Since being liberated from the iron heel of the Germans in October 1944, Greece has not improved; on the contrary, the situation has become even worse. Transportation is blocked, the economy is on the verge of collapse, and internal strife hinders even the simplest construction. Prisons are crammed with political prisoners, farmers cannot return to their fields, and the strong join the guerrillas.</p>
<p>The guerrillas entrenched in the mountains number nearly eight thousand, with about fifteen thousand villagers in contact with them. However, the government army, which claims to have one hundred thousand soldiers, actually has only fifteen thousand, and they are not skilled in mountain warfare, and their weapons are pitifully crude. Therefore, neither side engages in trench warfare, and the number of people involved in any engagement never exceeds four hundred.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the Communist Party has an office and publishes a newspaper in the capital city of Athens. High-ranking leaders within the party have not been arrested and imprisoned. They explain to foreign journalists that the reason they haven't been arrested is, "This allows the Greek government to appear very democratic in the eyes of the international community."</p>
<p>Although the majority of the Greek people live in dilapidated houses with leaky roofs and crumbling walls, and many have no coats and walk barefoot in the snow, the families of speculators and hoarders are adorned with Parisian perfume and wear American nylon stockings!</p>
<p>Most merchants are short-sighted and unwilling to invest in productive enterprises. The recent import manifest for Greece does not show a single "lathe," but it does show the import of one hundred and thirty-two brand-new automobiles!</p>
<p>Inflation is rampant, and banknotes are overflowing. People often tear up banknotes in the street, not taking it seriously. Many goods are priced in gold coins, and even servants know to exchange their wages for gold coins. The Greek treasury has almost exhausted its reserves of these coins, and they are becoming increasingly scarce in the market because wealthy Greeks are doing their best to hoard them to preserve their wealth.</p>
<p>The Greek government is at its wits' end and has had to seek help from the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Paul Porter, Truman's special envoy to Greece, said, "I hope that the aid funds will be strictly supervised after being handed over to the Greek government, ensuring that the beneficiaries are the majority of the Greek people, not a small number of corrupt officials and unscrupulous merchants!" (Excerpted from the April 5th Post)</p>
<h3>Introducing Miss Jiang Ying's Solo Recital</h3>
<p>— Dong</p>
<p>Miss Jiang Ying, the third daughter of the late military strategist General Jiang Baili, studied in Western Europe for over ten years, specializing in soprano vocals. Upon the strong invitation of friends, she is scheduled to perform her first solo recital since returning to China at the Lyceum Theatre in this city at 5:15 PM on May 31st. Given Miss Jiang's musical accomplishments and her performance record abroad, the event promises to be a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Miss Jiang has loved music since childhood. While studying at McTyeire School, she began learning the piano. In 1936, she traveled to Europe with her father, and the following year, she entered the Berlin Conservatory of Music, studying singing under Professor Weissenborn. After graduating in the summer of 1942, she studied sacred music with the highly acclaimed modern sacred music singer, Doria Loerle, and also studied music theory at the Sullig Music Institute under Professor Berther Luger. The following year, she studied opera with Wagner opera expert, Coga, and held concerts in major European cities. Her fame spread far and wide, and she became the most renowned singer of Eastern descent in the European music scene.</p>
<p>Miss Jiang spent over ten years in Europe, mastering English, French, German, Italian, Dutch, and Latin. Therefore, she can thoroughly understand the essence of famous songs from various countries. When she graduated from the Berlin National Conservatory of Music in Germany, her academic evaluation read: "Her innate talent, timbre, and expression are all divine." Very few Chinese can obtain this honor. Subsequently, the Berlin German Grand Theatre repeatedly extended invitations, and she entered into a recording contract with the "Telefunken" record company. However, with the outbreak of the war, she moved to Switzerland to continue her research in "harmony."</p>
<p>In 1943, Miss Jiang participated in the "Lucerne" International Music Festival in Switzerland and won the championship in the singing competition organized by Hungarian acoustics master, Jlona Durigo, becoming the first person of Eastern descent to win the award. European modern violin and educator, Carl Flesh, once heard Miss Jiang sing Bach's music in a church in Switzerland and told a friend: "If no one told me she was Chinese, I would surely think she was a future king of song with unlimited prospects." Bach's music combines the essence of religion and philosophy and expresses it through music.</p>
<p>This performance at the Lyceum Theatre is a rare opportunity for Miss Jiang to sing for the people after returning to China. The program includes sixteen pieces from Germany, Italy, Austria, and France, as well as operas. Professor Magolinsky, former conductor of the Municipal Symphony Orchestra, will be the accompanist. It is expected that she will achieve even greater success and meet the people.</p>
<h3>Fisherman's Pride</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>The Fisherman Benefits</p>
<p>——Seen in the French news agency's dispatch from Spain in the May 26th edition of this newspaper, a fisherman nets a box containing ten thousand taels of gold.</p>
<p>Strange tale from overseas cries to be told, fisherman casts net, harvest a surprise. Only thought a big fish was struggling hard, amazed box opens, ten thousand taels of gold shining bright!</p>
<p>The fisherman's heart is gladdened, wealth turns black! Is the Crystal Palace so abundant with riches! No wonder the Huangpu River has so many drownings, no doubt, most of them were gold seekers in life!</p>
<p>Note: Astrologers say that proper wealth is good luck, while windfall wealth is bad luck. The last three lines refer to those who fail in speculation and throw themselves into the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Serve in Office Then Trade—Miscellaneous Notes on Reading History, No. 1</h3>
<p>— Xiao Dai</p>
<p>The current difficult life of ordinary civil servants is a well-known fact. But with a careful study, it is not necessarily true that all civil servants are poor. There are many who have ways to accumulate gold and US dollars. Taking advantage of their positions to do a little business has become a common practice in today's officialdom. Although the government has repeatedly ordered that civil servants shall not engage in commerce, this is only a piece of paper. Don't you see the powerful and influential opening companies and firms, and the capital of wealthy families is squeezing the economic market?</p>
<p>In fact, the practice of civil servants doing business dates back to the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. If we were to speak in the tone of an old scholar, this could be called the "national essence." Moreover, people at that time already understood a set of rules for doing business. Their rules were: "Be optimistic about the changes of the times; therefore, when others discard, I take; when others take, I give." And "Trade goods with each other, eat the spoiled ones. Do not keep goods, dare not hoard for profit, discuss their surplus and shortage, then know the expensive and the cheap. When the expensive reaches the extreme, it will become cheap; when the cheap reaches the extreme, it will become expensive. Treat expensive goods like dung, and take cheap goods like pearls and jade. Wealth and currency should flow like water."</p>
<p>Compared with the operating methods of civil servants currently doing business, these methods are too outdated and cannot keep up with the times.</p>
<p>After doing business, it is said that one can become rich; not only can one manage the family, but also enrich the country. Let's cite two examples:</p>
<p>Fan Li, after avenging the shame of Kuaiji, sighed and said, "Of Ji Ran's seven strategies, Yue used five of them and was successful. Since they have been applied to the country, I want to use them at home." So he floated on the rivers and lakes in a small boat, changed his name and surname, and went to Qi, becoming Chi Yi Zi Pi;</p>
<h3>Words on Seal Carving</h3>
<p>— Feng Zhong</p>
<p>The characters on the seals that people generally use now are mostly called seal characters. Most of what is commonly used is the Small Seal script. In fact, the characters carved on seals do not have to be all Small Seal script. Some use "Stone Script," which is the "Great Seal" script; some use "Bronze Script," which is the inscriptions on bells and tripods; and some even use "Mo Shu" (ink writing), so it is incorrect to say that half of the characters carved on seals are "Small Seal" script.</p>
<p>In reality, the characters on seals do not necessarily have to be "Bronze Script," "Stone Script," or "Small Seal" script, and some are slightly different. This type of seal script is called "Erroneous Seal," which is an erroneous seal script. Why are there some errors? Because seals are a private signature symbol. To prevent others from privately carving them, some errors are intentionally made as a mark.</p>
<p>The number of characters is increasing day by day. Although some ancient characters have died out because they are not used by later generations, later generations are still innovating new characters. Therefore, if you want to carve a seal based on ancient seal characters without any mistakes, what will you do if there are no such characters in ancient times? For example, the character "village" 村 is often used in people's names. However, according to the seal script, there is only the character "village" 邨 and no "village" 村 character. Therefore, the "village" 村 character in people's names is often used as the "village" 邨 character on seals. If someone creates another "village" 村 character based on the form of the seal script, people may laugh at it from the perspective of philology, but from the perspective of seal carving, it is nothing. Let's take the character "seal" 印 as an example. We don't need to argue for modern seal carvers. Let's just flip through the seal manuals of ancient Qin and Han bronze seals, and we can find at least ten different styles. Chinese people admire the ancients. Since the ancients said that the characters carved on seals are "Erroneous Seal" (as stated in the preface to Explaining Simple and Analyzing Compound Characters), then why should we now be critical of the seal carvers for carving the characters unreasonably?</p>
<p>Zhi Tao, became Duke Zhu in Tao. Duke Zhu thought that Tao was in the center of the world, and the various lords traded goods there. So he managed his property, accumulated wealth, kept up with the times, and did not demand from others. ... Within nineteen years, he amassed a thousand gold three times, and distributed it twice to poor friends and distant brothers. This is what is called the rich who love to do good deeds. Later in his old age, his descendants continued his business and rested, and eventually reached millions. Therefore, when people talk about the rich, they all call him Tao Zhu Gong."</p>
<p>"Zi Gong, after studying with Confucius, retired and served in Wei, depositing wealth between Cao and Lu. Among the seventy disciples, Zi Gong was the most prosperous. Yuan Xian did not dislike chaff and bran, and hid in poor alleys, while Zi Gong connected carriages with silk and brocade, and used them to hire and entertain the lords. Wherever he went, the lords of the states would treat him as an equal. Was it not Zi Gong who made Confucius famous throughout the world? This is what is called gaining power and becoming more prominent!"—(Record of Biographies of Merchants)</p>
<p>Fan Li accumulated vast wealth, and Zi Gong gained power and became more prominent. These are the benefits of doing business. Only that little guy Yuan Xian was willing to hide in poor alleys.</p>
<p>After completing the research, I feel infinite joy, because from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods to the present, this custom has not declined for thousands of years, but has become even more developed and grand, which is truly a great thing!</p>
<h3>Bereavement Compensation</h3>
<p>— Liu Meng</p>
<p>In the "Gleanings from the Political Participation Council" in the 26th edition of Shen Bao, it was said: "Chen Gengya, who was a journalist, appealed for the colleagues who died during the Anti-Japanese War. He asked why the government gave only 30,000 yuan in bereavement compensation to Jin Huating, Zhu Xinggong, Zhang Xiaotong, and Zhang Sixu. What is that enough for?"</p>
<p>"What is that enough for?" Not only Chen Gengya would ask, but I also have the same question in my heart. 30,000 yuan can only buy at most one dou of rice, equivalent to about 1,000 characters of new No. 5 typesetting work, or the manuscript fee for an article of 1,000 characters. What is that enough for? Although money is the root of all evil, who can lack money? Saying that 30,000 yuan is bereavement compensation is really an exaggeration. It would be more appropriate to say that it is for buying a pen and a few pieces of paper for the orphans of the deceased.</p>
<p>The deceased are gone! Even if the government takes out less money as their "bereavement compensation," they will definitely not have any objections. Their willingness to risk bullets was definitely not to seek a sum of bereavement compensation from the government after death, so the item of bereavement compensation is dispensable. It is a pity that since the government is giving bereavement compensation, why is the bereavement compensation given so little? If this bereavement compensation is intended to give the loyal a kind of honor, then a certificate of merit can be competent enough, and there is no need to do this.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the number of people who sacrificed for the country, whether in the front or the rear, who are unknown, must account for the vast majority. In order to comfort the dead and encourage those who come after, I believe that we can take the example of France's "Tomb of the Unknown Soldier" and also establish one or several Tombs of the Unknown Heroes; to place the meaning of praise and commemoration... in one place, without the disadvantage of omission, just as in Catholicism there is a "All Saints' Day" to commemorate the unknown saints. Wouldn't that be good? I came to this from bereavement compensation, I don't know if it is appropriate?</p>

<h3>Love Meter</h3>
<p>— Jiao</p>
<p>Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd: "The Times recently reported that a Danish scientist has invented a love meter. This meter is small and exquisite and can be placed in a man's pocket or a woman's handbag. It has a scale that can measure the depth of love." This is an unprecedented news item that has never been heard of, but the report does not specify whether the measured degree belongs to oneself or to the other party, which cannot but be considered a regret for the readers. If it belongs to oneself, that's fine. If this meter can measure the depth of the other party's love, I hope that this scientist will manufacture it in large quantities. Not only can he make a fortune, but he can also reduce the suicides of those infatuated people who envy mutton but the ants don't. Between men and women, they will not be manipulated by false love and fall into the sea of ​​pity and bitterness.</p>
<h3>Record of a Besieged City</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Wandering like a ghost, he didn't even know how long he had been walking or what places he had passed. Finally, he felt his feet step on a pile of bricks and tiles, which felt like harder ground. He rubbed his eyes and began to look around. That's right, this was the ruins of the largest hotel in Jinchengjiang - the Railway Hotel! There were also many people resting on the broken rubble, their clothes were better than those of the other refugees in the town, but they were equally pale and emaciated.</p>
<p>Old Zhu's eyes seemed to catch a familiar face, but it was too unlike. That face shouldn't be so small, and it didn't let Old Zhu get a good look before quickly lowering.</p>
<p>It was the clothes he was wearing and the unusually short haircut that reminded Old Zhu and made him determine that this was Fatty Xu Shaoming - the general manager of Dahua Enterprise Company.</p>
<p>"So this guy also fell here?" Zhu Zhaonian thought to himself.</p>
<p>He felt a little hesitant. "Should I say hello to him?" Seeing how embarrassed he looked, not wanting to see acquaintances, why should I make him uncomfortable? But seeing him in such an unexpected situation, so embarrassed, and we are old friends, how can I turn a blind eye and not comfort him?</p>
<p>"Old Zhu, it's terrible! It's terrible! I'm finished!" Fatty Xu probably also knew that hiding from people like this was meaningless, so he took the initiative to walk over, sighing non-stop along the way.</p>
<p>Today's Fatty Xu is no longer true to his name. His face is pale, his cheeks are sunken, and the entire set of Hawaiian shirts and shorts he is wearing has also been dyed a gray color that symbolizes bad luck; when he shouted Old Zhu's name, Old Zhu could truly feel the sadness of an old ox about to enter the slaughterhouse from his voice.</p>
<p>At that time, Old Zhu couldn't help but ask him why he was in such a mess.</p>
<p>"That damned fire burned all my things, including three cars!" He was also straightforward and immediately poured out his heart: "Originally, there was also the first batch that was shipped out earlier, which had arrived in Dushan ten days ago, but my precious wife actually changed her mind and ran away with both the goods and herself! Now I'm finished! I'm finished...!"</p>
<p>As he said this, Xu Shaoming's tears fell like broken pearls.</p>
<p>"Don't be so sad! Everything is finished? That's not entirely true! At least you still have a country!" Old Zhu patted him lightly on the shoulder, unconsciously saying a set of words that Xu Shaoming absolutely didn't understand and didn't want to hear. "Although the country is dilapidated, it hasn't been destroyed to this day; as long as the country isn't destroyed, with your brother's talent, making a few more truckloads of goods is as easy as turning your hand, isn't it?"</p>
