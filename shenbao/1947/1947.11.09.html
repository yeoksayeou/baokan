<p>〔本報北平八日電〕聯總將軍新考慮華北救濟物資之支配與使用。華盛頓聯總中央委員會曾於本月七日討論中國救濟問題，惟結果如何，截至八日晚尙未悉。此間僅獲悉聯總近有二種行動：　天津聯總華北辦事處昨接獲滬聯總中國分署來電稱：「原定經由運河運往中共區域之船隻，聯總華府中央委會已核准將此批物資停運，並授權聯總津辦事處，立即開始卸貨。上海方面對是項決議通知張羣院長及行總，至物資卸下並運往區域所需款項，已請行總撥給」。　聯總近派工業專家克利爾等二人自滬來平，向行總平津分署索取北方工鑛復員需要資料，據稱：聯總對救濟華北物資中之工鑛器材，將重新考慮其支配，由此觀之，聯總之華北物資禁運令，或將有所變化。</p>
<p>〔中央社華盛頓七日電〕聯總負責人稱：聯總中央委會將在本月十三日再度召集會議，續商今後接濟中國辦法。週前上次會議中，聯總署長魯克斯之建議，包括各項援助中國復員及建設計劃，已提出討論，惟未獲決議。</p>
<p>〔中央社紐約八日電〕基督敎世界服務社宣稱：聯總　餘物資約二萬噸左右，準備在中國分配。自該署結束後，所餘物資即已存倉，該批物炎大部份爲食料及衣料，此項分配於中國將由基督敎世界服務社駐華之美國顧問委會主席亨利負監督之　，同時，行總人員將被邀請參加分配此項衣料食料等與苦難之中國民衆。</p>

<h3>王寵惠發表談話　解決東北問題　軍事外交並重　美援華進入具體計劃階段</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕國府委員王寵惠，昨論東北局勢，謂東北問題之解決，應軍事外交雙管齊下，方可奏功。在現階段中，可以軍事爲主體，但外交亦不可偏廢，否則即使軍事順利，隨時可能發生「意外事變」。蘇聯之對於東北，有其一定之國策與目的，其造成東北今日之局勢，旣用以對我，亦用以制美，由此觀點看，外交週旋奏功甚難。但蘇聯之政策雖定，其方法則常依實際情勢而有變易，據本人所知，勝利以來，蘇方對東北問題之態度，已改變兩次，故如我軍事順利，配合外交上之努力，則混沌局勢亦有開朗之希望。美國之援華行動，目前可能已進入具體計劃之階段，詳情則不得而知，將來如有大規模之經濟援助，當以改革幣制爲起點。</p>
<p>記者特詢王氏：國際間對目前我國之大選觀感如何？王氏答謂：友邦對我國之大選，均有相當期望，希望中國由此進入民主時代。但對大選之眞正評價，當取決於投票選舉時之實際情形，如無武力威脅投票及非法賄賂情形，則國際間方有好評。關於取締民盟，王氏承認已引起美國輿論上之若干反響，政府對此事事先亦曾預見，但仍不得不兩害之喑權其輕。取締民盟活動之利益有兩：　可避免因民盟宣傳而致影響民心士氣，　過去有若干地區民盟之活動，可補共黨之不足，為害甚烈，現經取締可告無虞。</p>
<h3>宋子文對記者宣布　粵省人事即發表　黃埔決開港海南緩改制</h3>
<p>〔本報廣州八日電〕粤主席宋子文八日招待記者，報吿晋京經過，據稱：　粤省現有保安部隊力量不足，待遇過差，故此次已呈准蔣主席，將原有保安團增加五個總隊，計共成十五個縱隊，二萬六千人，員兵槍械糧餉均有切實辦法籌得，今後粤治安至足樂觀。　粤省府人事決定，政院下次例會即可發表，各單位主管均爲最適當人選，必可增强工作效率。　增加煤量供應，已經經部商定，每月增一萬八千噸，其他工業原料亦獲得解決。　外間所傳華南經濟獨立，純屬子虛。至外人投資粤省，似亦時尙過早。　黃埔開港問題，已與交部商妥，即可開始，初期將使大輪船直達黃埔，次爲修築公路·碼頭，倉庫，無須所謂五年，十年計劃，就目前能力即可開辦。　海南島改制問題，決定緩議，淸剿瓊島大匪帮已有具體辦法。廣州行轅是否改組　將聽命中央。　粤省行政經費，中央已允儘量補助。</p>

<h3>縣長民選問題的商榷　儲子潤</h3>
<p>我國憲法定於十二月二十五日實施，離今不遠，爲日無多，全國朝野，刻已積極準備普選，俾能如期實行憲政，惟憲政之基礎，乃在地方自治。故國民黨六屆三中全會於本年三月問開會時，曾通過憲政實施準備案，亦　　重視地方自治，其第八項規定：「依憲法規定，擬訂省縣自治通則，加速推行地方自治，實行縣長民選。」最近內政部正在起草「省縣自治通則」，「縣長選舉罷免法」及「施行條例」，提請行政院第二十次例會討論。茲就縣長民選問題，加以商討。並提供若干意見，以備當局採納。</p>
<p>縣長應該民選，原則上毫無疑問；且實行民選縣長，爲實施縣自治之先決條件。主權在民之理想，才不落空。民主政治，始有基礎。我們認爲縣長民選之後，對於縣政之革新，至少有下列二個優點：　縣長由委派改爲民選以後，人民對於違法失職之縣長，自有隨時龍免之權，其任免權操在人民手裏，縣長對於人民之合理要求，自不得不予以然重，假借政令，殃民肥己等貪鄙之事，自不致如過去由上級機關委派縣長之毫無忌憚。民主監察制度，由此可以建立；貪汚之風，可以稍戢。這樣澄淸吏治，始有希望。　縣長改由民選產生，縣長與人民之間，當較委派縣長爲融洽，下情易於上達，對於自治工作及一切措施，當較合乎民情，易得人民之信任與擁護，庶政推行，自較便利，可得政通人和之利。</p>
<p>但縣長民選，在實行之初，可能發生種種流弊，實爲吾人所不可不愼重予以考慮者：　人民對於實施四權，尙無相當之訓練，對此神聖之選舉權，往往不爲重視，而隨便行使。故在目前之情形下，實行縣長民選，流弊不免叢生，或因感情而用事，或以投票送人情，或任意放棄投票權，其結果當選者，成爲多方運動選舉之野心家。難得選賢與能之理想標準。　人民文化水準過低，對於候選人之政治主張，缺芝認識及判別能力，不知其對公共團體的切膚利害，往往　於地方主義，或迫於封建勢力宗族觀念，傳統思想及頑固成見，不肯爲社會利益而犧牲個人利益。　縣長之任務，不僅為縣法人辦理其固有事務，（自治事務）且須受省政府之指揮，辦理中央及省之委辦事務，故縣長一方面爲縣地方自治首長，另一方面又爲行政官，刑事檢察官，征兵官，警察官，更兼國民兵團團長，田賦糧食管理處處長，征兵征糧，要人民的錢，要人民的命，均必須「强而後可」者，民選之縣長，在情理上往往以减輕人民負担爲酬謝人民擁戴之報酬，因此對於委辦事項不免存敷衍拖宕之心，以體卹民艱爲藉口，討好民衆，以致百政廢弛，一籌莫展，勢至影響國策之推行。</p>
<p>上述困難，勢所難免，故有人主張採取間接選舉制以代直接方法，也有人主張以考試限制被選舉權，以濟直接選舉之窮者，但査新憲法第一二六條之規定：「縣長由縣民選舉之」，其選舉之方法，依　憲法第一二九條：「本憲法所規定各種選舉，余本憲法別有規定外，以普通，平等，直接及無記名投票之方法行之」，縣長民選之方法，憲法中旣無特別規定，當然應採用直接選舉方法，否則即係違背憲法。故縣長民選採取直接選舉方法，自不能因噎廢食，而有所變更。即使目前行使直接選舉不免發生流弊，亦應使人民實地學習。</p>
<p>至於以考試限制縣長候選人資格，以濟直接選舉之窮。此種主張，可以內政部爲代表，他認爲籌劃縣長民選，應先行考慮者，厥爲縣長候選人資格問題，認爲無論在法律上，事實上，均有採取攷試方法之必要，縣長於辦理縣自治外，並負有執行中央及省委辦事務之實，其於執行委辦事務時，所處的地位，與一般公務員完全一致。故縣長實施民選時，似應先行舉辦攷試，定其候選資格後，再由人民投票選舉，庶於尊重民意之中，仍寓甄錄賢能之意，與三民主義中主張以考試制度救濟選擧制度之窮的精神相合，但按之新憲法，對各種假選人，均不採攷試制度，即國府前頒之公職候選人考試檢覈辦法，國府亦已明令廢止，各地公職候選人之檢　，亦早經停辦，現今單獨提出縣長候選人資格；必須先經考試，不特在憲法上毫無根據；且顯失公允。故最近行政院會議討論此案時，有人主張對於縣長候選人必須避免銓定資格之攷試字樣，免舉憲法抵觸。而另於縣長選舉法中，以列舉方式，規定積極資格及消極資格為之補充。但此點作者認爲仍有問題不敢苟同。蓋根據新憲法而訂之各選任人員之選舉法，對於候選人之資格，均無積極資格之限制，而今獨對縣長之選擧嚴訂其其候選資格似欠公允。</p>
<p>然則問題究應怎樣解決？以作者竟見，認為應採用縣長候選人提名法：爲提高縣長候選人資格，舉行考試旣爲憲法所不取，在選擧法中列舉積極資格，又為事實所不能，故惟有採用候選人提名之一法。現行國大代表與立委選擧，定有選民提名，與政黨提名二種。不特可以减低競選的耗費，减少競選者彼此間不必要之傾軋，更足以伸張社會正義，發揚社會公論，故為預心縣長民選之弊端起見，似可採用提名的方式。其方式如何？不外（一）縣民提名，須有全縣選民若干人以上之簽署，（二）縣議會提名，須有義員若干人以上之簽署。（三）自治監督之省政府提名，以上三種辦法由省政府提名，似有上級政府包辦選舉之嫌；由選民提名，在無選擧經驗之選民，亦不易提出適合理想之選。故三者之中，似以縣議會提名為　優。蓋縣議會提名後，再由選民選舉，於法於理，較爲允當。縣議員之素質較高，其所提之候選人自較適當，無考試及限制候選人資格之名，而有提高候選人資格之實。</p>

<p>蘇聯竟反對我國　參預擬計德和約　四外長代表支遭遇挫折　　〔本報訊〕倫敦八日廣播：四國外長代表會議今日遭遇困難，蘇聯代表對英美法所提贊成中國應參與對德和約起草工作之建議，表示拒絕。官方某觀察家認爲會議已遭遇挫折。各外長代表對於究有若干國家應在和約起草工作中具有發言權一點未能獲致協議。此與七個月前在莫斯科所遭遇之困難，如出一轍。英國在美國支持之下，主張巴基斯坦應有出席和會之權利，法蘇兩國對於此一問題目前不願有所決定。蘇聯主張參加和會各國，應以四强及其他二十國爲限，美國則主張曾對德國宣戰之五十七國一律參加。蘇聯代表史密諾夫反對英美法所提一項重要建議，即中國應與四强同爲「邀請國」。史氏所特理由，爲中國並未在對德停戰協定上簽字。蘇聯認爲德國須在中央政府成立而有實施和約之能力後，始能就和約發表意見。美國代表　飛則認爲德國之「負責代表」應有陳述意見之機會。此外美蘇兩國對阿爾巴尼亞能否參加和會一點，爭執頗烈，美國反對阿國參加，終至無結果而散。　　〔聯合社倫敦七日電〕外部發言人今日宣稱：蘇外長莫洛托夫之演說，實爲對英美政策之攻擊，此種言論適發於四大國着手草擬對德奥和約之前，殊屬不幸。四外長定於本月廿五日在此舉行會議，討論對德和約，「吾人亟望其成功」。發言人否認倫敦泰晤士報社論所謂英美政府已胸有成竹，倘對德和約談判再度陷於僵局，則將另闢蹊徑。據稱，該報所論並非事實，已往談判雖吿失敗，但吾人當憶及對蘇聯附庸如羅，匈，保等國和約，至最後一分鐘仍獲解決，而未至於決裂。英國與德西部佔領區並未成立何種協定，亦不擬於四大國談判破裂時單獨與之訂立和約。　　〔合衆社柏林八日電〕際此蘇聯十月革命紀念日，此間德國共產黨曾作非常强大之宣傳運動，叱可使德國人民特別爲美軍當局充分認濱德共之勢力有如何龐大。美應不異犧牲援助歐洲復興　哈里曼委會提出報吿　　〔聯合社華盛頓八日電〕總統直屬公民對外援助委員會今夜向杜魯門總統提出馬歇爾計劃硏究報告書，主張第一年先撥款五十七億五千萬美元援助歐洲，內三十餘億美元爲贈款，不須償還。　　自明年起四年援歐經費總數當在一百二十億至一百七十億美元之間。該委員會係銀行家與工會領袖等社會名流十九人所組織，由商務部長哈里曼兼任主席。報吿書長達十三萬二千字，經全體一致通過後已立即送還白宮，料將成爲杜魯門總統未來向巴黎經濟會議答復之主要基礎。其中對於歐洲各國要求頗予减損，據稱美國斷然不能供給所需小麥全部，農業機器應减一半，廢鐵取消，採礦機器亦應大量削减。美國對於援助參加馬歇爾計劃之十六國完成經濟復興，極表關切，但此種援助將使美國蒙受相當犧牲，包括防止通貨膨脹之財政決策在内。該會建議辦法三項如下：　另設獨立機構，管理馬歇爾計劃，並賦廣泛權力，便宜行事，但須與政府取得合作。此點與衆院國外經濟委員會昨日所討論者不謀而合。　現有各機構立即設法恢復局部有限的戰時權力，藉以推廣輸出。　在明年二月底後延長出口管制，並頭佈節約令，限制國內使用匱乏物資，以供對外援助之用。關於巴黎經濟會議之決議案，報吿書內亦有詳細分析，據稱其主要缺點厥在估計歐洲復興工業與推廣輸出能力過高。該報吿強調德國工業復興，尤其是魯爾煤產復興，必不可少，亦應儘先考慮，給予援助。極權主義國家已在思想方面對信仰個人自由各國公開宣戰，西方各國若用民主方法不能改善其內政，或將被迫改弦易轍背道而馳。　　〔美國新聞處華盛頓八日電〕杜魯門總統就哈里曼委員會所作對外援助報吿稱，各委員日理萬巨之任務，本人深為感激。委員會之報吿應可幫助完成一個良好之援歐計劃。維辛斯基談話　互尊乃和平基礎　　〔路透駐紐約七日電〕「紐約郵報」刋載訪問蘇外長紐辛斯基之談話，維氏曾表示資本主義與共產主義苟能互相尊重，以謀解決聯合國機構之糾紛、及建立較佳的國際關係，則兩者必能同處於一個世界上。離氏並曰，互　乃和平之基礎，苟無互尊，則蘇維埃集團與聯合；多數國即無從合作。當被詢及對於本屆聯大之成就有何感想時，維辛斯基表示，聯大固尙未結束，縱有良好的開　，如終塲時惡劣，仍將破壞全局，日後發展如何，固非意料所及。聯大委會討論會籍問題　美蘇代表起爭辯　美主張限制使用否決權　　〔聯合社成功湖七日電〕聯大政委會今日討論新會員入會問題時，對五大國之否決權，又起爭論。美國，阿根廷，瑞典，巴西，伊拉克，黎巴嫩與智利聯合要求准許義，奥，葡，芬，愛爾蘭與外約但入會，並請安理會重加考慮。　　蘇聯曾在安理會十次利用否決權阻止該六國入會，此種舉動今日一再遭受攻擊。美代表史蒂文森稱，否決權造成悲慘紀錄，關於入會由請一點，美國當贊成取消安理會中行使否決權，但當反對無資格入會者之申請。瑞典代表赫格浴夫促大會同時通過保，匈，羅，阿爾巴尼亞與外蒙之入會申請，以示一視同仁。美國反對各該國入會，蘇聯則表示贊成。蘇代表葛羅米柯發言一小時十二分鐘，答復各國之集中攻擊，主席當即宣布休會，此一問題俟明日決定。巴爾幹委員會　名單已發表　　我國由趙俊欣代表出席　　〔中央社成功湖七日電〕賴依秘需長今深夜發表聯合國巴爾幹特委會委員名單。我駐法使館一等秘書趙俊欣，被任爲我出席該委會之代表。對聖地問題　英所持態度　　不願單獨負責治安　　〔路透社倫敦八日電〕美政府昨夜要求英政府說明其對於美國所提執行巴勒斯坦分治之折衷建議案之意見後，英殖民大臣瓊斯今日曾訪貝文外相，就此有所洽商。美國建議由英軍負擔過渡期內維持巴勒斯坦治安之全部責任，據可靠方而稱，英國對於美國之建議案，縱於美蘇關於執行方法之意見已趨一致後，仍將表示拒絕。意即英國擬於不久結果委治，退出巴勒斯坦，不願對分治之執行供給任何物質援助。澳洲舉行普選結果　工黨政府遭慘敗　反對黨領袖霍爾威組閣　　〔本報訊〕倫敦八日廣播：墨爾鉢訊，澳洲舉行普選結果，工黨政府慘遭失敗。保守派反對黨對政府之主要攻擊，集中於政府擬將銀行收歸國有之計劃。反對黨領袖霍爾威出任新總理。新議會中霍爾威之澳洲聯合黨大致將佔廿六席，國家黨將佔廿一席，工黨將佔十八席。決心保衛喀什米爾　印度軍發動反攻　珍納迦藩邦亦發生動亂　　〔路透社史里那加七日電〕印度陸軍今日在裝甲輕砲隊及戰鬥機之掩護下，向史里那加迤西通至巴拉慕拉公路上之土著軍約一千名展開猛攻，據印軍發言人稱，印車已將土著軍之兩翼包圍，正繼續追擊中。同時阿勃社拉領導之喀什米爾臨時政府，已組成國防民團五千人，史里那加之主要廣塲已易名爲紅塲，公共機關均高懸紅底上綴白色耕犁之新國旗。　　〔路透社孟買八日電〕頃悉：印度半島東岸珍納迦士邦之軍隊，已與珍納迦臨時政府之軍隊發生初次接戰。珍納迦臨時政府係爲反對該邦回王之宣布參加巴基斯坦而成立，其軍隊已於今日進攻該邦邊界之諾的雅那城，惟雙方軍力有限，當不致發生大戰。東歐國家違反和約行爲　英當局考慮對策　　認蘇附庸此舉在加深東西裂痕　　〔路透社倫敦八日電〕選云數星期中，由於東歐若千國除左冀社會黨及共黨以外，各政黨之遭受摧殘，已使英國上院中之一部份議員，在鄭重討論對此等國家斷絕外交關係之可能性。星期三上院議員前英政府首席外交　問范西達曾在上院中提出此一問題，而上院議長喬維特亦代表政府表示贊成對東歐國家之違背和約之暴行有所譴責。　　本星期内東歐各國又傳來反對派政治家遭受壓迫之消息，波蘭農民黨領袖米柯拉保克雖已出走，惟其同志三人則已被捕。羅農民黨領袖馬尼沃已在依叛國罪被審判中，而該國外長泰達萊斯古領導之國家自由黨，顯然亦將遭遇同一命運。匈反對黨領袖費荔已逃出國外，而斯洛伐克共黨控制之政府改組，亦已在醞釀中。自今年二月間匈牙利小地主黨秘書長柯伐克斯突吿失踪，以及九月間保農民黨領袖員特柯夫慘遭處決後，類似之事件接踵發生，對於英國及其他盟國與此等東歐政府之關係當然不無影響。東歐政府此等舉動所引起之問題，有　東歐政府　殘愛國份子之動機何在；　東歐政府之不能容納農民及自由黨，已構成違背和約之行爲，西方盟國應取何種態度。自九國共產黨情報局成立後，東歐政府之取締反對黨派似更變本加厲，顯見鞏固東歐共黨勢力之計劃已在積極進行中。不論本屆倫數外長會議是否能避免德國亦即歐洲之分裂，然東歐政府之作風，顯然將嚴重增加分裂趨勢。羅女共黨員　保克任外長　　前外長將以叛國罪受審　　〔路透社羅京七日電〕羅外長泰速萊斯古及其他自由黨閣員三人辭職後，已於今日任命共黨員保克繼任外長，共黨員魯加繼任財長，社會黨員戈達萊斯古繼任工務部長，農民黨員史篤恩繼任文化部長。外長保克女性，年五十二歲，爲羅國女子出任要職之第一人。渠於一九二一年即參加共黨活動，一九三六年被控危害國家安全罪，處徒刑十年，一九四〇年經蘇聯說項，以被俘農民黨議員一名交換竊出，即往莫斯科担任羅馬尼亞事務之顧問。同時羅　觀察家咸信泰達萊斯古等，不久將被控叛國罪交付審判。巴黎工潮漸趨擴大　公用事業陷於停頓　　〔路透社巴黎七日電〕巴黎區六家僱用之衛生工人，已有百分之八十從事罷工，巴黎之公園遊樂塲及花園職工亦議決罷工，公墓管理者亦定今日表決怠工。自星期二巴黎之收稅員因要求加薪而怠工後，工潮即趨擴大。新受影響者為醫院洗衣工人，市運輸工人，清道夫及自來水工人，殯殮業職工則實行懈工運動。蘇聯國慶紀念　杜魯門電賀　　〔聯合社華盛頓七日電〕杜魯門總統今日向蘇維埃主席團長史維爾尼克致電祝賀國慶，內稱：「欣逢貴國國慶，願代表敝國人民向貴國人民誠意祝賀」。日政爭愈演愈烈　林平馬亦有被罷免可能　　〔新亞社東京八日電〕日衆議院昨日仍繼續討論預算問題，除社會黨議員荒畑繼前日之質問外，自由黨繼之提出質問，其中竟攻擊政府在組閣當時所標榜之八大政綱竟無一事實現，內閣實無存讀之意義。片山及其他閣僚對此竟朱能作答，其窘態可想。　　〔新亞社東京八日電〕國務相林平馬於七日之閣議上，作重要之發言，要求片山首相罷免法相鈴木及内閣書記長西尾，因此而使政局更爲激燙。片山旣不能接受其要求而罷免此二人，同時亦不能置之不理。政界一部份以爲片山首相或將以閣內不統一之理由而罷免林平馬。又民主黨亦以事態之意外惡化而表示驚愕，蘆田總裁希望林平馬自重，而努力防止事態之懇化。日隱藏物資　又有大批發現　　價値在一百億圓以上　　〔新亞社東京八日電〕轟傳已久之世耕事件主人翁世耕弘一，近又揭發九州地區之隱藏物資，價値約在一百億圓以上。據稱：此批物資係陸軍高唱「本土決戰」時運往九州者，共裝貨車五千八百輛，大部為軍服料，紗綫及織維品等。隱藏地以佐世保與久留米爲中心，至於其他地區如吳港及廣島地區，亦均尙有隱藏物資云。日甲級戰犯　續有六名獲釋　　〔新亞社東京八日電〕曾以甲級戰犯之嫌疑而被拘留於巢鴨監獄之太田正孝，伍堂卓雄，河邊正三，橫山雄偉，四王天延孝及木原次太郞等，已於七日被釋。購買日本貨物　得用英鎊付款　　〔中央社東京八日電〕英代表已與盟總訂定日期半年之協定，准許聯合王國，澳洲，曁各英屬殖民地之商人，用英鎊購買日貨，貨款將在倫敦，新加城，與香港等地為日政府保存。英政府担保日方要求付款時，即將此項貨款按官價匯率換成美金付給。盟總官員又宣稱：其他有關一國家如能作同樣保證，則亦可以問樣辦法，以其本國貨幣與日本貿易。英下院通過法案　開發殖民地資源　　將設立殖民地開發公司　　〔聯合社倫敦七日電〕英國發展殖民地經濟資源一案，今夜已由下院二讀通過，星期五將作最後批準。此案賦與國營公司二家以初期借款一億六千五百萬鎊（合六億六千萬美元）之權，以謀殖民地之發展。按所擬辦法，將設立一殖民地開發公司，具有一億鎊借款權力，以擴張殖民地之糧食及原料生產。另設一海外公司，鵝五千五百萬鎊借款權力，以促進糧食及其他家產品之產銷計劃。安理會補選理事　烏克蘭有望　　美擬設法打開僵局　　〔合衆社成功湖七日電〕據悉，美國可能選舉烏克蘭而非印度，以代替安理會中流蘭所出缺之位置。雖則美代表團否認此項消息，然他國代表堅稱，美國現正覓取方法，以求解決聯大所遭遇加拿大總理抵英　　〔合衆社倫敦七日電〕加拿大總理金氏，已於今晨乘「伊麗莎白」號抵此間。</p>

<p>太子河的創口　　數月之前，我們坐上中長路的列車，南轉營口，北至松花江邊，馳騁於千里沃野，偶見一瞥草地上的牛羊之羣，覺得時間悠長，只好看看明星賽報，或禮拜六週刊之類，消遺消遣。現在眞不同了，幾乎上車就走到鐵路的盡頭，連實石光輝的天蓋都顯得縮小了。　　昨大記者與東北水利局長董文琦先生，聯總東北代表麥康齊博士一通去遼陽二台子，視察遼河支流太子河堵口復堤工程和災區的農村，麥康齊博士是去看一看以工代賑的美麵是否直接分送到老百姓手裏。「十年征戍憶遼陽」，我們一行十餘人，一小時半的火車路程便到這唐人詩人歌唱的地方了。　　當局長是有名的水利專家，四川人稱之爲嘉陵江的河神，我說：「你修仙的地方很好，美麗的嘉陵江。」他說：「够苦的，我那時常乘一葉扁舟，逆流奔波。」他對於東北水利抱很大的希望，他期望以十年的努力造福地方，遼河治水第一五年計劃已擬定了。　　麥康齊博士是硏究農業的，他以硏究一種畜草而成爲著名的敎授。他是第一次世界大戰中的十七歲的靑年步兵，第二次世界大戰中的五十歲的砲兵中校，現年五十四歲了，强健而快樂的加拿大人，孩子般的哼着歌曲，他對於中國有很大的興趣。　　麥博士在火車上被遼腸二中的學生包圍着，學生們是從烟台乘車至遼陽讀書的，朝去暮返。麥博士似乎很關心孩子們的菜色面孔詳和詢問他們的生活，他問孩子們：「喝湯嗎！」孩子們回答：「喝開水。」他問孩子們每天吃不吃大豆，翻譯出來是吃不吃豆國，孩子們說：「吃是吃的，並不天天吃。」可見外國人是如何重視孩子們的健康，如何重視下一代的生命。　　至遼陽下車，改乘汽車走四十里至工地，此時的田野秋收已畢，農民忙着運同高梁楷，作冬天的燃料。工地的景象大不同了，八月十三日的洪水，淹沒了四十五萬畝田地，有些地方顆粒未收，損失無以數計。遼河這條毒龍，十年大洪水，三年小洪水，平均每年損失一千餘億元，（按本年七月物價値數統計）。今年決口十三處，遠南各縣水災難發五十餘萬。董局長擬定遼河治水第一五年計劃的目標，便是降服這條毒龍，陳誠將軍很讚助治水計劃，他說：「東北百廢待興，我們只要看準了一件事是造福國家人民的，馬上就去辦。」董局長說：「現在東北需要去綏遠江西購糧，這是我們的失敗，我們只要能把洪水冶平遼陽一縣豐收，便是夠　陽的食用，我們也不必求人了。」　　水利工程師們辛勤努力的工作熱情和虔誠堅定的俗仰，使我們感到無上欽偑，二台子工務主任趙中倫對記者說：「我們雖然很忙很苦，但覺得有意義，我們限看自己的工作成績，我們很實貴老百姓對我們的熱情。」年靑的副工程師豐恒淸。約廿五六歲，北洋工學院才畢業的學生，看他襄土滿面的樣子，與普通河工無異。原在行總工作，最近才到鄉梓服務，麥博士呼渠爲「好孩子」，麥博士一到中國來，他就喜歡這個外國人，因爲他沒有一般外國人的高傲態度。麥博士在鄉村中很容易與中國的農民相處，他留意各種農業上的問題，通過困難的語言隔閡與農民談話。底下是麥博士對於東北農業的意見　　麥博士對於東北農業的見解使我頹喪，當我們對於農耕曳引機感到最大的興趣時，他却很淡然的說我們捨本逐末。我提出農業到工業化的問題，美國或加拿大是否龍在技術上給我們大量帮助？他認爲問題太遠了，他說：「七十年前的美國，百分之七十的人口是農民，經過了七十年的努力，才把百分之四十的人口由農村拉到工廠，現在還有百分之卅的美國人在農村種地。以美國之科學發達，尙且如此困難，中國要走上工業化，談何容易！」他並且說中國有十分低廉的人力，要在農業上採用機械也極其困難，他說中國的地主不肯化太高的代價使用曳引機。照麥博士的意見，他認爲改進東北農業最重要的問題，應該是興修水利，改良種中，研究肥料等，我們應從這些事項着手，不能把問題看得太遠了。麥氏很惋惜的說：「日本人在東北研究改良種子的專家有廿多個，而你們中國人在東北研究農業問題的簡直如鳳毛麟角。」我聽了麥康齊博士的話，覺得他是若千外國友人中最愛中國的一觸。（記者趙展）漳州怪案　戴一蜚設騙局　召見縣垂詢政情　具悔過書出境　　〔本報羅州八日電〕閽漳州日前發生一騙局，有江蘇人戴一蜚，東吳大學畢業，前在平伸稅局服務，近突來漳，詭稱係國防部專員，來閩調査黃金黑市，渠服裝華麗，舉止闊綽，曾召見該縣縣長及貨物稅局長，埀詢政情等。事後爲漳軍警督察處識破，將其拘獲，自認假冒招搖，當局以其尙無重大罪跡，着具悔過書後，驅逐出境。王介佛巡視黃埭　　〔本報蘇州八日電〕吳縣王縣長干昨日出巡黃埭，今日續赴淞南陽城視察，明日返縣休息。週一可能赴吳西區視察，或將赴光福鎭，向淸剿指揮所指示剿匪機宜。殘害新兵曾繁淵判死刑　　〔本報衡陽八日電〕桂陽國區二大隊九中隊長傅磐石，分隊長曾繁淵，於今年五月十九日非刑殘殺新兵吳良村，經死者親屬吿發，解長沙軍管區訊辦。刻已審訊終結，曾繁淵處死刑，傳磐石在逃，通緝中匪高滕雲竄太湖　　〔本報蘇州八日電〕據關係方面悉：共系僞吳興縣太湖辦事處主任高滕雲，自經訓練後，竄入太湖活動，于本月六日夜間率部携幣機槍三挺，步槍卅餘支，山太湖邊區南庫地方投宿，翌晨拂曉率部向路軍越北尹郊外，竄人蘆莘庫一帶，有所企圖。寒山古鐘　住持轉請交涉歸還　　〔本報蘇州七日訊〕蘇州　門外寒山古寺，住特培元，以該寺所有唐代古鐘，於戰前爲日人竊去，迄未歸還，特以日人伊藤博文所作鐘銘為證，呈請蘇縣府，轉請上峯向日方交涉歸還。蘇省規定　共黨脫黨　登記處置辦法　　〔本報蘇州八日電〕吳縣關于共黨黨員及其工作人員等請脫黨登記處置辦法，茲由省府有保安司令部會同決定：　省級由省保安司令部政治部軍法科，民廳第四科辦理。　縣級由縣府民政軍事兩科，軍法承審員秉承縣長辦理。　省會及鎭江縣以十一月卅日為登記截止期，其他縣市定十二月十日截止。蘇高院通緝漢奸　向筱卿及周建唐　　〔本報蘇州八日電〕蘇高院刑庭今通緝漏綱漢奸，計偽中儲銀行蘇分行職員向筱難，及無錫周涇鄕僞鄕長周建唐等兩逆。錫保安隊　叛變案審結　吳俊將處極刑　　〔本報無錫七日訊〕駐防南方泉之保安第三中隊三分隊全隊官兵，被匪刦特事件，經縣府軍法室三度審訊，叛兵（吳俊，確為發動險謀主犯，分隊長呂榮光，機槍手資少華，投入湖中慘死，吳匪會在塲動手者，由脫險隊士張鳳池等到案作證。現本案業已審理終結，該匪所犯法條爲陸海空軍刑法第二編第一章第十七條之聚衆叛亂據掠武器罪，按律應處極刑，日內即將宣判。磚石橫飛缸碗亂擲　長沙碼頭工人互鬥　半小時傷六十餘人　　〔本報衡陽八日電〕長沙市大西門碼頭與碧灣子碼頭工人，因互爭搬運機，迭起糾紛，朱得具體結果。近因碼頭渥輸業冷淡，爭執更趨尖銳，連日時鵝爭執發生，六日美西門碼頭工人運米至草潮門，經過碧灣子時，又發生鬥爭，雙方各聚數百人，擺開陣勢，一時磚石橫飛，擊傷多人，磚石罄畫時，復亂擲破缸碗，並發現屠刀短棍，約門爭半小時，警局始趕到彈壓，事後調查，雙方負狎六十餘人，幸無死亡。袖珍新聞　　閔行　　〔本報訊〕行駛閔行上海間之汽輸，頃已復駛，每晨六時半，由閔駛滬，全程票價二萬二千元。　　淮陰　　〔本報訊〕揚州息：王縣長頃發吿民衆醫，稱：爲澄淸基層幹部，決淘汰鄕鎭保甲長中之「三朝元老」，並望民衆多加協助。　　南通　　〔本報訊〕土布改進委員會，於五日舉行成立大會，推定馬乾哉等十五人爲委員，決對今後南通土布之尺寸，品貨及運銷等，有所改華。　　杭州　　〔本報訊〕杭市政會議頃決定：為充實市區治安力量計，決在下月設置常備自衛隊一大隊，即日將在谷區徵募壯丁四百五十名充任，至各隊土槍械糧餉，由市經費項下提撥．　　吳興　　〔本報訊〕縣府頃奉省令，以軍糧萬急，刻不容緩，際茲新穀登塲，速配軍米一萬包，限於十一月內分批繳解，並派張春舫來湖督導。又訊：縣參會一屆五次大會，頃電請中央並浙省保安司令部，速派國軍開駐吳興，以資防衛。</p>

<p>陳部長昨由京來滬　督導棉紗聯配事宜　中紡收購棉花距離目標尙遠　　〔本報訊〕經濟部部長陳啓天昨日自京抵滬，曾與紡聯會杜理事長晤談，聞與棉紗聯配事宜有關。陳氏並會赴復興公園參觀菊展。　　又訊：經濟部長陳啓天昨晨由京抵滬，陳氏此次來滬，係為督導棉紗聯合配銷事宜。按陳氏半月前爲督導此事，曾來滬一次，後因民營紗廠反對甚劇，未得結果而返。刻政府以聯合配銷勢在必行，且全經會並通過責令經濟部負責督辦，是以陳氏昨日特再來滬，與各方面治商一切。　　陳氏昨晨抵滬後，當即召見紡調會代主委劉泗英，袁處長仲達，對民營紗廠意見有所　詢，並於下午四時往訪杜月笙氏，對此問題作詳盡商討。　　又訊：中紡公司收購本年度國產棉花，已得三十萬担，該公司原定之收購目標爲三百萬担，依照日前之數字，僅及總數十分之一，而新花業已絡續上市，收購恐難達到原定日標　　究其原因有三：　現鈔缺乏，公司計劃以六萬億國幣收購三百萬担棉花，詎各地棉花價漲，非十二萬億元無法收購，收購時各地農民均望現鈔，不收本票或支票，六萬億之現鈔，不易兌得。　因時局不靖，各地棉花遭受焚燬損壞者極多。　交通阻塞，西安·鄭州·靈實。等地堆存之棉花甚多，雖由飛機源源運滬，然因飛機有限，仍有無法暢運之感。銀根鬆·買胃健　棉紗布繼續上揚　　四二支藍鳳又漲百五十萬　　昨日棉紗市况，因銀根鬆濫，同業納胃甚健，染織廠及各帮，搜朮仍股，更以民營廠少有開出，市上籌碼枯薄，市勢再吿騰踴。迨至最後，四二支藍鳳細紗，繼續狂　一百五十萬爲三千六百五十萬元。其他各支粗細紗，均續見翔翔五六十萬至一百餘萬元不等。　　棉布市况，晨開以散戶競進，漢口及重慶客帮採購暢旺，本街染廠吸納更强，並傳紡建公司供售額將减少，且銀根異常鬆弛。各方人心激昂，行情飛黃騰達。嗣因經監人員蒞塲監視交易，近收人心轉軟，且有浮戶獲利出籠，市勢稍挫。但結果十二磅龍頭等各檔細布，，比上日步昂七千至一萬五千元，其他各布亦都軋升。　　現棉挺升　　昨日現棉市况堅挻，銀根鬆弛，買氣甚濃，紗廠納胃平平，同業對做較旺。更以產地疾升，人心振奮，價格較上日升十萬左右，各檔成交二三○○包。送廠價做開靈寶三九二萬七千，三九六萬八千，沙市三七○萬四千，次貨三六三萬七千，冲沙三六三萬七千，至三七○萬四千，火機二七二萬八千，白洛去三八四萬四千，成交一千一百包。　又棧交價做開靈寶三八四萬四千，山東花三八四萬四千，漢細三五一萬三千，冲沙三四七萬二千，老河口三四三萬，脫力司三八四萬四千，成交一千二百包，周浦籽花六六萬。中信所有日呢　尙在接洽外銷　市上已發現香港走私貨　　〔本報訊〕中信局過去以易貨方式進口之日本呢三十萬碼，至今尙存儲於倉庫內。據有關人士表示：原則上擬將共外銷，並買進羊毛原料，以供國內工業之需。目前尙在接洽過程中，對像爲外國政府而非私人商家，惟以所需外匯頭寸甚巨，短期中不易收效。以澳洲而論，固爲羊毛出產之區，但因本身能加工織造，故非交易之適當對象。英政府於我國向日本購買之前，已先行　進一百五十萬碼，運至香港，然後走私人我國境，上海市塲上已發現此類日本呢。又以易貨換進之日本脚踏車，運到者共兩千輛，最近對日貿易指導委員會有將其配給各機關之決議，但據中信局方面訊，此項消息尙無所聞。二千輛爲數甚微，其購進亦以我國之物資爲代價，如作適當處理，對國庫亦有裨益。　　將校呢銷暢　　呢羢市面，日來堪稱風平浪靜，茶會上及大批發戶喊價，均無甚大上落。　薄呢羢嗶嘰趨勢，大半已至上漲乏力，下跌不能之局面。將校呢市銷頗形暢達，然其售價則頗平穩，整塊原段每碼批沽六十五萬元，一套二套另頭，每碼批沽五十七八萬元，買辦者只有徐州帮一路，而其來源則爲漢口香港。食米店胃活絡　粳秈米均見回高　　昨日南北兩市共到米糧一萬二千九百餘石，市况各貨一致全面上揚，米市店胃活絡，粳米挺升萬元，秈米回高二萬元，白元險元均加一二萬元。　　麵粉實消奇旺，飛漲七八千至萬元不一。麩皮隨之上升三五千元。豆餅汕頭台灣暢吸，急於特裝，猛升三五千元。黃豆南洋船位未滿，客帮興化泉州汕頭進胃頗濃，續見高翔，盤漲萬餘元。　　菜豆南洋去化活靈，挺進萬元。赤豆零化　殷，回高一二萬元一。惟　豆則畏縮不前，依然少神。苞米北洋採納，高貨回升萬元，中次平正，紅糧散戶轉動，疲而轉挺，回漲萬元。　　芝蔴油廠吸胃甚貪，繼缺步漲一二萬元，形勢逐步高翔。生仁紹興猛力採購，　帮亦有問津，中間飛跳三五萬元，高貨京然帶升一二萬元。　　油市店胃蜂起，各油一致重見回漲。生油狂漲七八萬尤，豆汕跟漲三四萬元，菜油猛加三五萬元，蔴汕亦然回高二三萬元。食糖回振　　昨糖市以銀根已鬆，均見回好。公會劃盤，二四粗白初爲九十一萬元，旋至九十四萬元及四萬五千元，升五萬許。二○中砂白八十六萬元至八十七萬八千元八十八萬元，號貨開汕靑七十四五六萬元，棉赤高八十五萬元，普通八十萬元，順德靑七十二萬元，計二百數十包。興化白袋莊高貨九十二萬元，　莊九十萬○五千元。海南赤七十八萬元，計三百餘件。刁靑七十四萬元至七十五萬元，計百數十包。行局差出　銀根續鬆　　〔本報訊〕昨日銀根續鬆，據中央銀行方面透露，下週起銀根可能轉緊。昨日四行兩局仍差出六九四億，計中國銀行差出五七一億，中農出差六一億，中信差出五五五億，郵匯差出六一億，合作金　差出六億。國行差入一六○億，交通差入四○二億，大交換行莊差入一五五億，外　銀行差入四一六億，小交換行莊差入一二三億。暗息一角七分，華股貼息一角八分。買方勉力支持　華股脚地尚穩　　華股昨業中人心不一，求供飄忽，雖穩而倍形艱難，新空之參加，使買氣冲淡，加之塲外查賬之舉，繼續加緊，漲勢不無阻遏，港匯再縮，廣帮吸收，尙堪支持，前途當待新的刺激。五和成交寥落，連跌多日，昨反動漲停外，大半榮辱互微　　晨初　　以財部表示减低遞交證金，寄予同意而開高，永紗以三二二元及三一五元開後曾賣小到三○七元及三一五元後，又進至三一二元及三一八元。塲外又有査賬之舉，買氣被阻，而低至三○七元及三一一元。五和掛漲停，乃拉高到即交三一四元，遞交三一九元高價。華新水泥此時領導小股，亦漲達一一六元高價，塲外息價仍站一角三分半及一角八，雖無影響，但一成交一度冷落，而見即交三和五元，遞交三○八元低價。港申電傳低至五元半，廣帮有納，近午曾拉高至三一一元及三一五元光景。經力售漲勢又阻，永紗退至三○八元及三一○元收市。午收結果較前收即交永紗信和華新榮豐國貨水泥信誼微升，大通升半成，恒豐漲一成，五和漲停板，勤興中法美亞　安水業均平，新光業福永公景綸火柴華豐中絲中紛統益徵挫。遞交股計永紗美亞小升，華豐徵挫，信和新光景福勤興均平，塲外各老股均見穩健，中華世界各漲半成。工業原料分配　亟應參酌改進　　（本報訊）據有關機關統計：目前國內最感缺乏之工業原料，爲二硝基氯化苯燒碱，馬口鐵，黑鐵皮，燐，氯酸鉀，木漿等。此類原料之進口限額，應酌予提高。通過各公會辦理之各廠原料分配，亦有不平均不公允之處。政府對今後工業原料之進口與分配，似應有一固定之政策，對於軍用工業及重要之民生工業，應提高供給數量，並應祥細調査各廠之生產量，由一專設機構負分配之責，方能達到公平合理之目的。香港政府對於此類事件之措置，頗可參考。當地機關對各廠之產量，前先已詳細統計，其批准外匯結售時，即以此爲標準。凡請准外匯之廠家，其成品批發出售時，規定照成本加利潤三成，商家零售時再加三成。合漲利潤在穩定之幣價下已屬相當優厚，但執行嚴厲，如有不遵規定者，商品沒收之外，負責人送法院究辦。上述辦法，收效甚大。我國如欲效法，只須對幣値跌落一點，加以補充辦法，餘均適用。統債平穩　外股上升　　公債平穩少變，三六○室六二八室買進，五五二室五○三室有供，統丙晨開二一六○○元，高價不過二二二○○元，而後稍平。結果較前收計甲乙升四百元，統丙徽升一百元，統丁好四百元，統戊獨平，成交約七百萬左右　　外股昨仍在港匯再縮聲中，續向前進，怡紗再達高價，怡嗶有發息之助，所漲更多。證劵帮廣　咸進，洋行帮有供。怡紗晨開二一三○○○元，高價僅二一七○○○元，而後吿平，起仆有限。結果較前收計會德豐　植升半成，怡嗶業廣祥泰各漲一成左右，餘咸小升。台灣美種烟葉　三十萬磅運滬　　台灣所產美種烟葉，質地甚進。本市烟葉商會同業公會，以該省烟產尙豐，品質又良，値此豫省烟葉遝輸阻梗，美烟又不獲進口之際，如能獲得當地政府之許可，准將台省自用剩餘烟葉轉運來滬，實爲捲烟廠所歡迎。因曾函台灣有物資調節委員會，轉呈台灣省政府，請求核准。嗣奉台灣省物資調簡委員會復函，謂公賣局負責人聲稱，一俟台省烟業於本省自用之外，若有餘剩，當可運滬。茲據烟業消息，台灣省公賣局，最近會將台灣陳烟葉三十萬磅運滬銷售，最初曾向各華商捲烟廠兜售，以價格未洽，交易未成。最後售與本市外商經營之　中公司，以每磅三萬五千元成交，總價値達一百○五億之鉅。聞今年新烟，尚將陸續運注銷售云。不乏乘高求售　人造絲昂後再疲　廠經綢貨買氣均甚熾盛　　人造絲昨市因不乏乘高求售者，以致欲漲無力，昂後再疲。一二○號一A旭字有光，上午八千八百五十萬元即期有二三箱成交，最大週一期喊九千萬元，中午已降至七百五十萬元賣出價。下午續疲，最後爲六百萬元賣出價，結果與上日價相差無幾。　　廠經　　昨市欣欣向榮，實銷去　不弱，成交價步步上升。晨間高零担做開六千四百萬元，迄中午成交價，已高至六百萬元，下午行悄，比較軟弱，喊五百五十萬元脫手。各級五担單子貨喊價，比上日高二百萬至三百萬元不等。干經亦帶起二百萬元左有。　　綢貨　　昨市真絲被面，因買氣甚熾，開市即較上日高升一百萬元。大誠與華强貨先做四百六十五萬元，後在七十五萬元左右盤旋，收市即期做八十萬元，週一期五百十萬元，下午稍軟，塲外做比上午短十餘萬元。人造絲貨因原料平定，漲勢緩和。華錦縐高檔貨喊五萬四千元，真絲貨如縐緞等，　昨均堅穩。　　中信規定　人絲配價　　〔本報訊〕中央信託局依據該局十一月八日人造絲會議，宣佈下週十日至十五日人造絲配售價格如下：東洋大富貴一A（每箱）六千三百五十四萬元，二A六千二百二十六萬元，三A六千零三十六萬元，四A五千七百十八萬元，天橋一A六千三百二十八萬元，二A六千二百另二萬元，三A六千零十二萬元，四A五千六百九十六萬元。其他雜牌，一A六千三百萬元，二A六千一百七十四萬元，三A五千九百八十六萬元，四A五千六百七十萬元。　　申請表册　送局審核　　〔本報訊〕據中信局發言人昨日宣稱：該局配售人造絲，向係根據各公會核報各廠台機，及需絲數量之申請册，予以核配。十月十五，十六兩日，該局爲調整各埠各公會之比額起見，曾邀集各有關公會公開討論，相互之比額、以昭公允。目前各公會巳根據此項比額，造就新申請表册，陸續送至該局。現該局規定此項表册，仍應詳予審核。本埠者送本市社會局審核，並議定：　本月第二週照新比額分配。　如木月第二週未審核前，先照新比額百分之四配給。　在審核期間停止配給，俟續配時准予照補云。洋莊茶成交少　　昨日洋莊茶市，出口商對於外銷茶，雖與貨方談判，惟終難獲得順利，是以成交數量咸僅零星，價格方面，除溫州大帮每担軋升十萬元外，他若遂安大帮等各好起五萬元左右，而脚地頗爲堅挺。至於內銷花色，本街店莊等地之買氣，亦不比隔日稱遜，但執主堅持之念，則變本加厲，因此供求漸趨失調狀態，交易遂吿銳落，情勢則績形鋒鋩。二區火柴公會　請求配給原料　　〔本報訊〕第二區火柴公會，以　處浙南，過去未得限額分配之利益。最近各廠已聯合呈文經濟部，附有過去六個月之生產數字，請求配給三萬六千元美元之原料。工貸會審核貸款　通過七十三億元　　〔本報訊〕國行貼放委員會工業貸款審査委員會，於本月七日下午四時，在外灘二十四號五樓貼放會會議室，舉行第三十一次例會。出席委員黃首民，王性堯，史久　，歐陽崙，周錦水等十餘人，由史久騫任主席，審查工業貸款申請案件，計通過三十件，金額七十三億元，惟尙待下週貼放例會重加核定云。商業簡訊　　江海關頃奉財政部令轉經濟部規定，所有一○○伏至一二○伏，及二一○伏至二三〇伏之燈泡匯准暫予進口。　　我國前以工業上需要，會向日本購買工業器材，並以　砂作交換品。此項　砂招商局預計每月運輸五萬噸。　　昨日捲烟市面，因銀根甚鬆，同業與新買一致搜求，行情昂勝甚勁。結果十支大英老刀，較上日步升九十萬至七十萬地。其他中外條烟，亦昂一二千地，五聽烟亦軋升二三千元。</p>

<p>自由談弘一法師圓寂五週年  翁貴嶽　　弘一法師圓寂已有五年了，明天，他生前的好友及弟子們，將在玉佛寺舉行紀紀念會念他，同時還展覽他的遺墨。　　法師俗姓李，字叔同，曾留學日木，回國後致力提倡新藝術，可稱是中國新藝術的鼻祖。他善書法，他的楷書堪謂近世獨步。他演過　，做過報館裏的編輯，也執過　　，對於新藝壇的貢獻至鉅。當他抛去了敎職悄悄地跑到虎跑寺去難渡的時候，他的好友，他的學生，以及愛好他藝術的人，都爲之驚奇，以爲他不知受到了什麽極度的刺激，於是是消極了，出家了。當時他的家屬趕到寺裏去跪求他拔見，勸他返俗，但是都給他拒絕，他是一心皈依的了。他出家後的修爲吿訴我們，他並沒有消極，時時以　悲為懷，以眾生為念，欲救醒在米茫中的眾生，引渡彼岸，所以他並不出世，他還是人世的，　只不過他救世工作是無形而已。　　法師圓寂雖有五年了，但是他的藝術是不朽的，他的德昔與靑山常綠！問題的回答  王平陵　　中國的貪風，爲什麼愈到後代愈盛行？崑山的顧炎武先生對此問題，又有很好的回答，他說：「近代貪吏，倍於唐宋時代的原因，　唐宋之吏廉，而今日之更貧也，而是因爲唐宋的貨幣是銅錢，明末淸初是銀子，錢重則難動，銀輕而易　，難運，則少取之猶以爲多，易　，則多取之尙以爲少。」　　的確，要携帶十多萬貫銅質的錢，回家去享淸福，釘釘鐺鐺，真有些不太方便。唐宋是著名的貪吏，就算能括到一屋子的銅錢，合以現在的數目字，至多値到黑市的美鈔十元而已，而要携帶十元的美鈔，多麽方便。銅錢是硬性的策車的金屬，有聲有色，更容易被人舉發，如果遇到東漢劉寵那樣鐵面無私的長官，自己的大與子從庫房裏機帶一個五銇錢套在耳輪上，遊戲似地走出來，都得處以貪汚的刑罰，斬首示衆，這使存心括銅錢的古代公務員，也就不能不有所戒心了。在今天自從萬元的法幣出籠以後，美鈔的黑市，已跟着扶搖直上，捆捆紮紮，動輒就是十億百億，數雖擴大，量仍不多，顧炎武先生如生在今天，必然要根據他的新發現，喟然長嘆說：「噫！貪風之盛，不知伊於胡底矣！　　更有進者，（那是我的看法。）古代的公務員，就是括到一船或一斛的銅錢，至多不過是多置田宅而已，現在括到到了美鈔，可以住洋房，坐汽車，羅列一大批寵妾和情婦，優哉遊哉，懿歟　哉，聊以卒歲。因此之故，人非聖賢，誰能免俗，苟有機會，何不米他一手，成則可以享樂一生，敗亦不至於斬首示衆。　兼之，今天的社會勢利成風，祇要有錢，誰來考證錢的來歷，貪汚之徒，縱有愧於良心，實無損於自己的一切，倘能對無數被困在飢餓綫上的可憐蟲，抽去總財富的千萬分之一，稍發慈悲，則樂善好施，救苦救難的美名兒，依舊口碑載道，轟傳宇內，是則貪汚者的身價，反能由於美鈔黃金一的增多，更被社會各方面尊重起來。在這種情形下，希望文官不要錢，比希望武人不怕死，實在艱難得多。當局者必欲做到文官為要錢，就非使做文官的確有怕死的戒心不楞。　　貪生怕死，人之常情，凡要錢的，一定是怕死的，因爲必先活下去，才能發揮錢的妙用。今之貪汚者親眼發現要錢的人有的是，都沒有要過他們的命，常是到處春風，長袖善舞；而極少數眞是不要錢的人，反是打入十八層地獄，永遠抬不起頭來，這些現實的教訓，像爭幕上的　面似的在面前放映。他們爲什麽不更現實一些，捉住機會，就死不放手，盡量搞一個痛快呢！但如果回能鐵面無私，執法如山，不折不扣地做到「要錢者必死，」絕怕死」的戒心，決不敢「以身試法」，我想念「要錢不要命的人」，容或有之，決不太多。　　因怕死而不敢要錢，同時再盡可能地掃　奢侈，使有錢的人，無法在狗馬聲色上放縱自己的享受，一面則崇尚即儉，看重學術，獎勵生產的開發，在相當期間，自能轉移習俗，逐漸造成不要錢的風氣，進一步鼓勵一般做文官的以身許國，抱定「不怕死」的精神，勵精圖治，用人惟賢，致天下於太平的盛世。留美學生的實騐工廠  良哉　　美國紐吉賽洲林登地方Linden，N.　J.一座大廈的牆上，有力地嵌着幾個中國字「中國發動機製造廠」這是美國土地上的一個中國「自己」的工廠。　　這座工廠在戰時原屬於美國海軍部，留學美國的中國工科學生看中了它，他們希望把它變成一個實驗工廠，自己來管理自己來工作，以求技術上的精進，商議的結果，便發動一個捐款，幾經努力終於獲得了散居美國，加拿大，拉丁美洲華僑一千餘人的支持，購下了這座工廠。　　他們與美國電氣職工聯合會U.　E.　W.取得諒解後，便正式開工，除了少數美國工人以外，重要的技術管理工作幾乎都由這些年靑有爲的留學生担任，他們穿着一身油汚膩膩的工衣，熱心地操作，有時在吃飯桌上還要討論疑難，相互切磋。　　中國發動機製造廠現在因爲鋼鐵採購不易，生產量略受限制，每月約可出產二千至二千五百具發動機專門用以裝配冰箱。他們預備再事擴充，要達到月產六千具的目標。　　「中國發動機製造廠」這幾個大字是胡適博士的手筆。那些留學生們在牆上加量的一枚大大的靑天白日國徽，也在太陽下面發出耀限的光芒。直接稅局的幽默  斯芒　　日前在友人的辦公室裏，偶然發現幾張表格，是直接稅局的「綜合所得稅所得總額報吿表」，其中有兩項殊爲滑稽，一項是直系親屬的生活費，一項是在中等以上學校的子女敎育費。直系親屬的生活費是拾萬元，子女敎育費是五萬元。不知這個標準是照什麼定的？大概定道個標準的人還以爲現在的物價，已經回復到十年前的情形了。假使他是照現在的情形而定的話，那麼十萬元買一斗多米，五萬元買一本普通的敎科書，要是稍重要的敎科書，五萬元買不到一本，其他還談什麽生話？還要受什麽敎育？恐怕定這個標準的人也要爲之失笑。影壇一週  李箴　　「二房東小姐」這是以戰時華盛頓的房荒爲題材的喜劇，故事輕鬆，劇情流暢，而劇本的優點，是能抓住現實，即使在今天看來，依然有着雋永的趣味，這是編劇者　不可抹煞的功績。　　女主角琪恩亞瑟擅長扮演喜劇角色，在比片中有極爲出色的表演，二個男角却爾斯柯本與佐麥克利，同樣有着堪與匹敵的演技，尤以柯本爲佳。　　導演對本片的處理，處處抓緊，無一步鬆懈，可惜較爲造作些，缺少點晴的韻味。　　「銅山碧血」此片是「蝴蝶夢」的作者譚芬蝶瑪利艾的小說「亂餓山岡」所改編的，故事是以礦塲生活爲背景，與穿插兩族人的私仇，而以互相仇殺爲糾葛。但也許小說的材料太多了，在二小時的電影內無法容納，結果使這部片子，顯得故事冗長而散漫。至少可以說在最近放映的英國片中，這是部較差的片子。疊字漫掇  王百里　　余於昨日「疊字漫掇」中，以爲西廂記之「悄悄冥冥，潛潛等等，等我那齊齊整整，嬝嬝婷婷，姐姐鶯鶯」嘆觀止矣，今讀西靑散記，見有田家婦雙卿，（恨不知其姓，有能吿我，功德無量，）以通篇疊字塡「鳳凰臺上憶吹蕭」，尤覺生動有緻，難得，難得！詞云：「寸寸微雲，絲絲殘照，有無明滅難消，正斷魂魂斷，閃閃搖搖，望望山山水水，人去去，隱隱迢迢，從今後，酸酸楚楚，只似今宵。　再這，間天不應，看小小雙卿，嫋嫋無聊，更見誰誰見，誰痛花嬌，誰望歡歡喜喜，偸素粉，寫寫描描，誰還管生生世世，夜夜朝朝」！　　「靑春底旋律」蘇聯的紀錄片，確較優於好萊塢所攝製的。這部是蘇聯一九四六年體育節的紀錄片，它帶來了最優異的成績，不論從畫面·角度·彩色，都給人一種新鮮的印象。　　「雙雄鬥智」這部描寫新聞記者與流氓鬥智的劇本，有着頗爲不錯的內容。從這故事中也反映了美國社會的某一部份生　　導演茂文李勞埃是觀衆最熟悉的人物，但他在這片中的成績，僅只能做到平穩，並無較佳貢獻。愛德華魯濱遜與愛德華亞諾旗鼓相當，可以一看。　　「翠鳳艷曲」「米高梅」的五彩豪華作，一九四六年十大名片的殿軍，可是這些輝煌的頭街，依然帶來了一張使人頗爲失望的片子。　　「妙女郞」又是一張描寫作曲家的成功史。但片子着重在歌舞的表演，那個作曲家顯得並不十分重要。這是一部普通的歌舞征。貝爾納斯揭露：四强外交秘密  珊　　至於我個人呢，我可以很坦白的說，蘇聯在東部德國的行動，和在波蘭，羅馬尼亞及保加利亞，這反雅爾達密的。假如蘇聯決心不參戰的話，我真要深覺滿意呢。日本雖則一再堅持不願無條件投降，我却相信原子彈定可成功，而今日本在遵從我們的條件下接受投降。我深恐紅軍進入滿洲後將發生怎樣的事態，在他們撤離滿洲之前，我的恐懼實現了。　　當蘇聯參戰的雅勻達條約成立時，軍事局面完全改觀，羅斯福總統和我們的軍事領袖們，需要蘇聯來作戰。沒有一個想得到雅爾達會議後我們所遭遇過的種種困難。無論如何條約業已締結，我們只有遵守而已。　　總統答復蘇聯的信，由我起草，開頭提起一九四三年十月三十日，蘇、美、英，中聯署的莫斯科宣言會規定，為維持國際部的和平與安全，四國間應隨時相互商洽。其次又提到聯合國憲章一百零六條，及一百零三條條文：「聯合國會員國在本憲章下之　務，與其依任何其他國際協定所負之義務有衝突時，其在本憲章之下義務應居優先。」　　這封信的結語是：「憲章雖然沒有正式批准，但蘇聯代表在舊金山時，却已同意蘇聯政府將為安全理事會會員之一。鄙意在莫斯科宣言與憲章條款之下，蘇聯政府正宣表示其願意與其他强國商洽合作，對日作戰，以期達到維持各國間的和平及安全的目的。」總統後來告訴我，史達林元帥對此會表示其很大的感謝。　　八月七日下午，我們返抵華盛頓。前一天我們在船上已獲悉第一顆原子彈已經擲在廣島了。我們回來後的翌日，長崎也遭受原子彈轟炸，蘇聯向日宣戰，從八月九日開始。八月十日淸晨，瑞士政府工來日本預備接受波茨坦宣言的公交，「具有這宣言並不包含有損及日皇為最高統治者，任何要求的默契。」</p>

<h3>Further Adjustment of Candidate Quotas; Party Lists to be Announced Soon; Chairman Summoned Key Personnel to Instruct on Election Affairs</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Chairman Chiang invited the heads of the five Yuan (branches of government) and Kuomintang (KMT) elders for a luncheon at his official residence on Huangpu Road at 12 noon on the 8th, which dispersed at approximately 1 p.m. During the luncheon, Chairman Chiang provided instructions regarding election matters.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The complete list of political party nominations for National Assembly representatives was not released on the 8th, as the revised lists submitted by the Democratic Socialist Party (Min She) and the Youth Party (Qing Nian) are still under discussion in separate meetings of the KMT, Min She, and Qing Nian parties. The Min She and Qing Nian parties have no objections to the revised quotas; their dissatisfaction lies with the coordination of personnel and regions. This task of re-coordination and adjustment is extremely difficult, and the KMT is working on it day and night. Once the lists from both parties are received, the General Election Office will immediately announce the lists from all three parties simultaneously. It is rumored that the announcement may be made at noon on the 9th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Election Committee of the National Occupational Women's Organizations Election Office held its ninth meeting at 3 p.m. on the 8th, presided over by Committee Member Fu Tso-dai as acting chairman. The meeting approved the case of signing and registering Huang Renyan and 102 others as candidates for National Assembly representatives from occupational women's organizations and decided to issue a supplementary public announcement on the 9th.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The General Election Office received a telegram from the Anhui Provincial Election Office dated October 7, stating that the voter registration lists for the National Assembly representatives election in that province had not been submitted by various counties within the deadline. After investigation, it was confirmed that eleven counties—Lihuang, Lu'an, Tongcheng, Taihu, Qianshan, Huoshan, Shucheng, Yuexi, Linquan, Hao County, and Quanjiao—were handling the matter separately due to special circumstances involving communist bandit disturbances. However, thirteen counties—Wuhu, Jiashan, Huoqiu, Fengyang, Taiping, Fanchang, He County, Wuwei, Shou County, Hefei, Dingyuan, Huaining, and Wangjiang—repeatedly ignored telegrams urging them to submit the lists. The ranking county magistrates, who also served as chairmen of the election committees, were given warnings as punishment for neglecting election affairs. Furthermore, the election offices in Tianchang and Xuancheng counties were commended for conducting election work according to the prescribed schedule and achieving excellent results, with the chairmen of the committees providing effective supervision.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 8th] It has been widely rumored here recently that the central government, in response to requests from the Min She and Qing Nian parties, intends to make rigid allocations of National Assembly representative candidates for certain counties in Fujian Province. Chen Lianfen, chairman of the KMT Fujian Provincial Party Headquarters, has sent a special telegram to the central government suggesting that all parties be allowed to nominate candidates, who will then participate in open and free elections with other candidates who are legally endorsed by voters.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Various legal groups in Guisui City recently jointly elected Wei Ji, speaker of the Municipal Council, to come to Nanjing to petition for the addition of one National Assembly representative. (The list of National Assembly representative candidates from various locations is published on the left corner of page two.)</p>
<h3>UNRRA Approved Suspension of Shipments of Materials to Communist Areas in North China; Remaining 20,000 Tons of Materials to be Distributed in China</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 8th] The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) General is newly considering the distribution and use of relief materials for North China. The UNRRA Central Committee in Washington discussed the China relief issue on the 7th of this month, but the results were unknown as of the evening of the 8th. It has only been learned that UNRRA has taken two recent actions: The Tianjin UNRRA North China Office received a telegram from the UNRRA China Office in Shanghai yesterday stating: "The UNRRA Central Committee in Washington has approved the suspension of the ships originally scheduled to transport materials to the communist areas via the Grand Canal and has authorized the Tianjin UNRRA Office to immediately begin unloading the cargo. Shanghai has notified President Zhang Qun and the Executive Relief Administration (ERA) of this decision. Funds needed for unloading the cargo and transporting it to the areas have been requested from the ERA." UNRRA recently sent two industrial experts, Mr. Clear and another person, from Shanghai to Peiping to request information on the needs for the rehabilitation of northern industries and mines from the Peiping-Tianjin branch of the ERA. It is reported that UNRRA will reconsider the allocation of industrial and mining equipment in the relief materials for North China. From this, it can be seen that the UNRRA's embargo on materials to North China may change.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] UNRRA officials stated that the UNRRA Central Committee will convene another meeting on the 13th of this month to continue discussing future aid to China. At the previous meeting a week ago, UNRRA Director-General Rooks's proposals, including various plans for assisting China's recovery and reconstruction, were presented for discussion but no decisions were made.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 8th] The Church World Service announced that approximately 20,000 tons of surplus UNRRA materials are ready for distribution in China. The remaining materials have been stored in warehouses since the agency closed down. The majority of these materials are food and clothing. The distribution in China will be supervised by Henry, the chairman of the American Advisory Committee of the Church World Service in China. Personnel from the ERA will also be invited to participate in the distribution of these clothes and food to the suffering Chinese people.</p>
<h3>US Aid to China Issue to Become Presidential Election Program</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] Political observers here believe that the recent calls for aid to China by the Republican Party and the criticism by New York Governor Dewey of Truman's aid to China policy (or lack thereof) may make the China issue a program for next year's US presidential election. Representative Judd is scheduled to return to Washington on the 8th. It is expected that he will raise the China issue when the two congressional committees meet on the 10th to review Marshall's emergency aid to Europe report.</p>
<h3>Sino-US Exchange of Cultural Personnel</h3>
<p>Agreement to be Signed in Nanjing Tomorrow</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] The Sino-US agreement on exchanging students and technical and cultural personnel to implement the US Fulbright Act will be signed in Nanjing on the 10th. The Act stipulates that any country that purchases US surplus materials can transfer a portion of the proceeds in its local currency to fund a cultural personnel exchange program. Currently, besides China, 21 other countries are expected to participate in this agreement. The Soviet Union cannot participate because it has not purchased US surplus materials.</p>
<p>Chairman Hosts Kirk</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] General Kirk flew from Qingdao to Nanjing at noon on the 8th. That evening, Chairman Chiang hosted General Kirk at his official residence on Huangpu Road.</p>
<h3>Soviet Pravda Publishes Chairman Chiang's Congratulatory Telegram</h3>
<p>Molotov Receives Foreign Guests</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Moscow, 8th] Pravda published Chairman Chiang's congratulatory telegram to Shvernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, today. The newspaper published the congratulatory telegrams from Truman, Tito, and Outer Mongolian Prime Minister Choibalsan yesterday. Molotov's reception last night was very successful, and all the guests enjoyed themselves very much. Molotov was especially cordial to the foreign guests and delegations who came to celebrate the Soviet National Day. Soviet Ambassador to China Petrov also attended the reception. He said that he is still on vacation.</p>
<h3>Celebration of Sun Yat-sen's Birthday to Follow Past Practices</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] November 12th is the anniversary of the birth of Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation. The central government has previously stipulated the commemorative measures: a one-day holiday on that day, national flag-raising celebrations, and commemorative meetings held separately by all levels of government agencies, schools, and organizations. Local senior party headquarters will convene commemorative assemblies of all sectors. This year, all localities will still convene commemorative meetings in accordance with the previously established measures.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] On the morning of the 12th, the National Government will hold a memorial service at 10:00 AM at the mausoleum and memorial hall of Sun Yat-sen on the occasion of Sun Yat-sen’s birthday. Chairman Chiang will personally preside over the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Eight Japanese Rubber Factories to be Distributed by Four Countries</h3>
<p>Most Internal Machinery Unusable</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Eight Japanese synthetic rubber factories have been designated as reparations to be distributed by China, Britain, the Netherlands, and the Philippines. Each factory is currently preparing for inspections prior to the drawing of lots by the four countries. However, according to senior members of the Chinese delegation, some of the machinery in the eight factories is already engaged in peacetime work, and most of the remaining machinery is unusable. Under normal circumstances, the eight factories can only produce 2,312 tons of rubber annually. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the portion to be used for reparations is worth transporting. Furthermore, the seven synthetic oil factories, originally scheduled to be included in the reparations along with the rubber factories, have now been removed from the reparations list because some of them have been converted into alcohol factories. In addition, Chinese experts have inspected five of the seventeen ordnance factories designated for reparations to China. These factories have a total of 94,147 pieces of machinery.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Discusses Solving the Northeast Problem: Military and Diplomacy are Equally Important; US Aid to China Enters Concrete Planning Stage</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] National Government member Wang Chonghui discussed the situation in the Northeast yesterday, stating that the solution to the Northeast problem should involve both military and diplomatic approaches to be effective. In the current stage, the military should be the main focus, but diplomacy should not be neglected. Otherwise, even if the military is successful, "unexpected incidents" may occur at any time. The Soviet Union has a specific national policy and goal for the Northeast. Its creation of the current situation in the Northeast is used to confront China and restrain the United States. From this point of view, it is very difficult to achieve success through diplomatic maneuvering. However, although the Soviet Union's policy is fixed, its methods often change based on the actual situation. According to what I know, since the victory, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Northeast problem has changed twice. Therefore, if our military is successful and we coordinate diplomatic efforts, there is hope for the opening of the muddled situation. The US aid to China may currently have entered the stage of concrete planning, but the details are unknown. If there is large-scale economic aid in the future, it should start with currency reform.</p>
<p>The reporter specifically asked Wang Chonghui: What are the international perceptions of the current general election in our country? Wang Chonghui replied: Friendly nations have considerable expectations for our country's general election, hoping that China will enter a democratic era through this. However, the true evaluation of the general election will depend on the actual situation during the voting. If there is no use of force to threaten voting or illegal bribery, then there will be positive comments internationally. Regarding the banning of the Democratic League, Wang Chonghui admitted that it has caused some negative reactions in American public opinion. The government foresaw this beforehand, but had to choose the lesser of two evils. There are two benefits to banning the Democratic League's activities: It can avoid the influence of the Democratic League's propaganda on public morale, and the past activities of the Democratic League in some areas could supplement the Communist Party's deficiencies, causing great harm. Now that it has been banned, there is no need to worry.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Announces to Reporters Personnel Changes in Guangdong Province to be Announced Soon; Huangpu Decided to Open its Port; Hainan's Restructuring Delayed</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 8th] Guangdong Chairman Song Ziwen hosted reporters on the 8th and reported on his visit to Nanjing. He stated: Guangdong Province's current security force is insufficient and the compensation is too poor. Therefore, he has presented to Chairman Chiang for approval to increase the original security regiment by five brigades, for a total of fifteen regiments and 26,000 men. There are practical methods for obtaining personnel, firearms, and supplies. The security in Guangdong is extremely optimistic. The decision on the provincial government's personnel will be announced at the next meeting of the Executive Yuan. The heads of each unit are the most suitable candidates and will certainly enhance work efficiency. An increase in coal supply has been agreed upon with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, increasing by 18,000 tons per month. Other industrial raw materials have also been resolved. The rumors of economic independence in South China are pure fabrication. As for foreign investment in Guangdong Province, it seems to be too early. The problem of opening the Huangpu port has been agreed upon with the Ministry of Communications and can begin immediately. In the initial stage, large ships will be able to directly reach Huangpu, followed by the construction of roads, docks, and warehouses. There is no need for a so-called five-year or ten-year plan; it can be launched with the current capabilities. The issue of restructuring Hainan Island has been decided to be postponed and there are specific methods for suppressing the major bandits on Hainan Island. Whether the Guangzhou Provisional Headquarters will be restructured will be determined by the central government. The central government has agreed to provide as much subsidy as possible to Guangdong Province's administrative expenses.</p>
<h3>National Army in Western Liaoning Achieves Another Major Victory; Main Force of the Communist 7th Column Completely Destroyed; Chairman's Handwritten Order to the Soldiers and Civilians of Shijiazhuang</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 8th] Military news: On the morning of the 7th, the Chahar-Suiyuan Field Army forces operating outside the pass defeated over 20,000 of the main force of the Communist 7th Column in the areas of Si Hai Wo Peng, Meng Gu Bao, and Ma Jia Wo Peng, 30 li northwest of Zhangwu on the Dagu Tonglu Road in western Liaoning. From morning to dusk, fierce battles lasted all day, killing over 7,000 communist bandits, capturing over 500 communist officers and soldiers, and seizing two mountain guns. Other weapons and ammunition are being cleared. This battle is of great importance to the Northeast war situation, and the threat from the west has been lifted.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 8th] The National Army in western Liaoning achieved a major victory in the Zhangwu and Xinlitun areas west of the Dagu Tonglu line, defeating the Communist 7th Column and part of the East Mongolia Autonomous Army, killing, wounding, and capturing over 8,000 communist bandits. This is an unprecedented victory in the sixth offensive. This battle is of great importance in stabilizing the northwest corner. The success of the National Army lies in the secrecy of its actions, and the communist bandits have suffered the misfortune of being "eaten."</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 8th] Army Commander Pan Yu-kun flew back to Changchun from Nanjing today. According to reports: The National Army won an unprecedented victory in Zhangwu, and the main force of the Communist 7th Column was completely destroyed. The National Army pursued and suppressed them for 60 li, and the Air Force inspected from the air, finding communist corpses everywhere, and the remaining bandits fled north. Pan believes that this victory is probably the biggest blow the bandits have suffered in their so-called sixth offensive. Pan was summoned to Nanjing on the 6th.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 8th] There are no traces of bandits within 40 li of Changchun. The bandits who sneaked in from Danantun were driven away by the National Army's attacks. Xiahelong also has no traces of bandits. In Karen on the Jilin-Changchun line, there are only a few communist bandits, and Jiuta only has its teams stationed. However, over 100 bandits are harassing Mishaizi in Changbei. The National Army attacked and drove them away. It is also learned that bandits are frequently transporting goods between Jiutai and Jilin. After the National Army in Jilin launched continuous attacks in the northwest and southwest, the periphery of Jilin has gradually been cleared.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Shijiazhuang, 8th] The Shijiazhuang Defense Command received a handwritten order from Chairman Chiang on the 6th, ordering the soldiers and civilians to work together to defend Shijiazhuang. The original text is as follows: "Commander Liu: The communist army is besieging Shijiazhuang. The Air Force will fully assist in the battle and will surely crush the communist offensive. The required ammunition has been ordered to be supplied by the supply station. I hope that you will supervise the soldiers and civilians of the whole city to work together to defend Shijiazhuang. Focus on defeating the bandits. Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 8th] The battle outside Shijiazhuang is still fierce. The battle for the airport in the western suburbs of the city is intense. The communist army has broken in several times and is engaged in fierce battles with the defending forces. The situation in Zhengding City is unclear. Fires have also broken out in the suburbs of Yuanshi and Huolu. The offensive and defensive battles are underway. Currently, the National Army is coordinating land and air forces to launch a full counterattack. The offensive of the bandit army outside the city has been slightly frustrated. The situation in Shijiazhuang City is still calm. Officials stated that the battle in Shijiazhuang has not yet reached the stage of a decisive battle.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union Actually Opposes China's Participation in Drafting the German Peace Treaty</p>
<p>The Meeting of Representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers Encounters Setbacks</p>
<p>〔Report from Our Paper〕London, Radio Broadcast on the 8th: The meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers encountered difficulties today. The Soviet representative rejected the proposal by the British, American, and French representatives to support China's participation in drafting the German peace treaty. An official observer believes that the meeting has encountered setbacks. The representatives of the foreign ministers failed to reach an agreement on how many countries should have the right to speak in the drafting of the treaty. This is the same difficulty encountered in Moscow seven months ago. Britain, with the support of the United States, argues that Pakistan should have the right to attend the conference, but France and the Soviet Union are currently unwilling to make a decision on this issue. The Soviet Union argues that the countries participating in the peace conference should be limited to the four great powers and twenty other countries, while the United States argues that all fifty-seven countries that have declared war on Germany should participate. The Soviet representative Smirnov opposed an important proposal by Britain, the United States, and France, that China should be one of the "invited countries" along with the four great powers. Smirnov's specific reason was that China did not sign the German armistice agreement. The Soviet Union believes that Germany must form a central government that has the ability to implement the treaty before it can express its views on the treaty. The United States representative Philip Jaffe believes that Germany's "responsible representatives" should have the opportunity to express their opinions. In addition, the United States and the Soviet Union had a fierce dispute over whether Albania could participate in the conference. The United States opposed Albania's participation, and the meeting ultimately broke up without result.</p>
<p>〔United Press, London, 7th〕An external spokesman declared today: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech was an attack on British and American policy. It is unfortunate that this statement was made before the four great powers began drafting the peace treaties with Germany and Austria. The four foreign ministers are scheduled to hold a meeting here on the 25th of this month to discuss the German peace treaty. "We earnestly hope for its success." The spokesman denied the editorial in the London Times that the British and American governments had already made up their minds that if the German peace treaty negotiations were to stall again, they would seek another path. It is said that the newspaper's argument is not true. Although past negotiations have failed, we should remember that the treaties with Soviet vassals such as Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria were resolved until the last minute and did not lead to a breakdown. Britain and the western occupied zone of Germany have not established any agreement, nor do they intend to conclude a treaty alone if the negotiations between the four great powers break down.</p>
<p>〔Associated Press, Berlin, 8th〕On the occasion of the anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, the German Communist Party here launched a very powerful propaganda movement, capable of making the German people, especially the U.S. military authorities, fully recognize how large the strength of the German Communist Party is.</p>
<p>The United States Should Not Sacrifice Aid to European Reconstruction</p>
<p>The Harriman Committee Submits a Report</p>
<p>〔United Press, Washington, 8th〕The President's Committee on Foreign Aid, directly under the President, submitted a research report on the Marshall Plan to President Truman tonight, advocating that $5.75 billion be allocated in the first year to aid Europe, of which more than $3 billion would be grants and would not need to be repaid. The total amount of European aid funds for the next four years should be between $12 billion and $17 billion. The committee is an organization of nineteen social figures, including bankers and labor union leaders, chaired by Secretary of Commerce Harriman. The report, which is 132,000 words long, was unanimously approved and immediately sent back to the White House. It is expected to become the main basis for President Truman's future response to the Paris Economic Conference. Some of the requests from European countries have been reduced. It is said that the United States cannot categorically supply all the wheat needed, agricultural machinery should be reduced by half, scrap steel should be canceled, and mining machinery should also be significantly reduced. The United States is very concerned about aiding the sixteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan to complete their economic recovery, but this aid will cause the United States to suffer considerable sacrifices, including fiscal decisions to prevent inflation. The committee suggested three measures as follows: Another independent agency should be established to manage the Marshall Plan and be given broad powers to facilitate action, but it must cooperate with the government. This point coincides with what the House Foreign Economic Committee discussed yesterday. The existing agencies should immediately find ways to restore limited wartime powers in part to promote exports. Export controls should be extended after the end of February next year, and austerity orders should be issued to limit domestic use of scarce materials for foreign aid. The report also has a detailed analysis of the resolutions of the Paris Economic Conference, stating that its main shortcoming is that it overestimates Europe's ability to recover its industry and promote exports. The report emphasizes that the recovery of German industry, especially the recovery of Ruhr coal production, is essential and should also be given priority and assistance. Totalitarian countries have openly declared war on countries that believe in individual freedom in terms of ideology. If Western countries cannot improve their internal affairs by democratic methods, they may be forced to change course and go in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>〔U.S. Information Service, Washington, 8th〕President Truman said on the Harriman Committee's report on foreign aid that he was deeply grateful to the members for their handling of such a massive task. The committee's report should help complete a good European aid plan.</p>
<p>Vyshinsky's Remarks</p>
<p>Mutual Respect is the Foundation of Peace</p>
<p>〔Reuters, New York, 7th〕The "New York Post" published an interview with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky. Vyshinsky said that if capitalism and communism could respect each other to solve the disputes of the United Nations and establish better international relations, then the two would be able to coexist in one world. Vyshinsky also said that mutual respect is the foundation of peace. Without mutual respect, the Soviet group and the United Nations will not be able to cooperate. When asked what he thought of the achievements of this General Assembly, Vyshinsky said that the General Assembly has not yet ended. Even if there is a good start, if the end is bad, it will still ruin the whole situation. How things will develop in the future is not something that can be predicted.</p>
<p>UN General Assembly Committee Discusses Membership Issues</p>
<p>U.S. and Soviet Representatives Argue</p>
<p>U.S. Advocates Limiting the Use of the Veto Power</p>
<p>〔United Press, Success Lake, 7th〕When the UN General Assembly's Political Committee discussed the issue of new members today, the veto power of the five major powers sparked another dispute. The United States, Argentina, Sweden, Brazil, Iraq, Lebanon, and Chile jointly requested that Italy, Austria, Portugal, Finland, Ireland, and Outer Jordan be allowed to join the UN and asked the Security Council to reconsider. The Soviet Union has used its veto power ten times in the Security Council to prevent these six countries from joining the UN. This action was attacked repeatedly today. U.S. Representative Stevenson said that the veto power has created a tragic record. Regarding the issue of joining the UN, the United States will support abolishing the exercise of the veto power in the Security Council but will oppose the application of those who are not qualified to join the UN. Swedish Representative Hagelberg urged the General Assembly to simultaneously approve the applications for membership of Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Albania, and Outer Mongolia to show equal treatment. The United States opposed the membership of these countries, while the Soviet Union expressed its support. Soviet Representative Gromyko spoke for one hour and twelve minutes, responding to the concentrated attacks from various countries. The Chairman immediately announced a recess. This issue will be decided tomorrow.</p>

<p>England's Attitude Towards the Holy Land Issue</p>
<p>Unwilling to Bear Sole Responsibility for Security</p>
<p>〔Reuters, London, 8th〕After the U.S. government asked the British government last night to explain its views on the U.S. compromise proposal to implement the partition of Palestine, British Colonial Secretary Jones visited Foreign Secretary Bevin today to discuss the matter. The United States suggested that British troops bear all the responsibility for maintaining security in Palestine during the transition period. According to reliable sources, Britain will reject the U.S. proposal even after the U.S. and the Soviet Union have reached a consensus on the method of implementation. This means that Britain intends to end its trusteeship and withdraw from Palestine in the near future and is unwilling to provide any material assistance for the implementation of the partition.</p>

<p>Determined to Defend Kashmir</p>
<p>Indian Army Launches Counteroffensive</p>
<p>Disturbances Also Occur in the Junagadh Princely State</p>
<p>〔Reuters, Srinagar, 7th〕Under the cover of armored light artillery and fighter planes, the Indian Army today launched a fierce attack on about 1,000 indigenous troops on the highway from Srinagar west to Baramulla. According to an Indian military spokesman, Indian vehicles have surrounded the two wings of the indigenous army and are continuing to pursue them. At the same time, the Kashmir Provisional Government led by Akbar Shah has formed a national defense militia of 5,000 people. The main square in Srinagar has been renamed Red Square, and the new national flag with a white plow on a red background is hung on public institutions.</p>
<p>〔Reuters, Mumbai, 8th〕It is learned that the troops of the Junagadh state on the east coast of the Indian peninsula have engaged in the first battle with the troops of the Junagadh Provisional Government. The Junagadh Provisional Government was established to oppose the state's Muslim ruler's announcement to join Pakistan. Its troops attacked the city of Nudiana on the border of the state today. However, the military strength of both sides is limited, and a major war is unlikely to occur.</p>
<p>British Authorities Consider Countermeasures for East European Countries' Violation of Treaties</p>
<p>Believing that Soviet Vassals' Actions are Deepening the East-West Rift</p>
<p>〔Reuters, London, 8th〕Over the past few weeks, the suppression of political parties other than the left-wing Socialist Party and the Communist Party in several East European countries has led some members of the British House of Lords to seriously discuss the possibility of severing diplomatic relations with these countries. On Wednesday, former British government chief diplomat Vansittart raised this issue in the House of Lords, and House of Lords Speaker Jowitt also expressed support on behalf of the government for condemning the East European countries' violations of the treaty.</p>
<p>This week, news of the persecution of opposition politicians has come from East European countries again. Although the leader of the Polish Peasant Party, Mikolajczyk, has fled, three of his comrades have been arrested. The leader of the Romanian Peasant Party, Maniu, is being tried for treason, and the National Liberal Party led by the country's Foreign Minister, Tatarescu, will obviously suffer the same fate. The leader of the Hungarian opposition party, Ferec, has fled the country, and a reorganization of the government controlled by the Slovak Communist Party is also brewing. Since the sudden disappearance of Kovacs, the secretary-general of the Hungarian Smallholders Party, in February this year, and the tragic execution of the leader of the Bulgarian Peasant Party, Petkov, in September, similar incidents have followed, which of course affects the relationship between Britain and other allies and these East European governments. The questions raised by these actions of the East European governments are: What is the East European governments' motive for persecuting patriotic elements? The East European governments' inability to tolerate the peasant and liberal parties has constituted a violation of the treaty. What attitude should the Western allies take? Since the establishment of the Cominform of the nine Communist parties, the East European governments' suppression of opposition parties seems to have intensified, showing that the plan to consolidate the Communist forces in Eastern Europe is being actively carried out. Regardless of whether this London Foreign Ministers Conference can avoid the division of Germany, that is, Europe, the style of the East European governments will obviously seriously increase the trend of division.</p>
<p>Romanian Female Communist Member Pauker Appointed Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Former Foreign Minister to be Tried for Treason</p>
<p>〔Reuters, Bucharest, 7th〕After Romanian Foreign Minister Tatarescu and three other Liberal Party cabinet members resigned, Communist member Pauker was appointed Foreign Minister today, Communist member Luca was appointed Finance Minister, Socialist member Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej was appointed Minister of Public Works, and Peasant Party member Stoican was appointed Minister of Culture. Foreign Minister Pauker is a woman, 52 years old, and is the first woman in Romania to hold an important position. She joined the Communist Party in 1921. In 1936, she was sentenced to ten years in prison for endangering national security. In 1940, through Soviet persuasion, she was exchanged for a captured Peasant Party member and went to Moscow to serve as an advisor on Romanian affairs. At the same time, Romanian observers believe that Tatarescu and others will soon be charged with treason and brought to trial.</p>
<p>Paris Labor Strikes Gradually Expand</p>
<p>Public Utilities Come to a Standstill</p>
<p>〔Reuters, Paris, 7th〕80% of the sanitation workers employed by six companies in the Paris area have gone on strike. The employees of parks, playgrounds, and gardens in Paris have also decided to go on strike. Cemetery managers are also scheduled to vote on a work slowdown today. Since the tax collectors in Paris went on strike on Tuesday demanding a raise, the labor unrest has gradually expanded. The newly affected workers are hospital laundry workers, city transportation workers, street sweepers, and water workers. Employees in the funeral industry are implementing a slowdown movement.</p>
<p>Congratulations from Truman on the Anniversary of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>〔United Press, Washington, 7th〕President Truman sent a telegram to Soviet Chairman Shvernik today to congratulate him on the anniversary of the Soviet Union, which read: "On the occasion of your country's anniversary, I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to the people of your country on behalf of the people of our country."</p>
<p>The Political Strife in Japan Intensifies</p>
<p>Hirano May Also Be Removed from Office</p>
<p>〔New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th〕The Japanese House of Representatives continued to discuss the budget issue yesterday. In addition to the questioning by Social Democratic Party member Arahata following the previous day, the Liberal Party followed up with questions, even attacking the government's eight major policies that were touted at the time of the cabinet's formation, saying that none of them had been implemented and that the cabinet really had no reason to continue in office. Prime Minister Katayama and other cabinet members could not answer this, and their embarrassment can be imagined.</p>
<p>〔New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th〕State Minister Hirano May made an important statement at the cabinet meeting on the 7th, requesting Prime Minister Katayama to dismiss Justice Minister Suzuki and Cabinet Secretary Nishio, thereby making the political situation even more turbulent. Prime Minister Katayama could neither accept his request and dismiss these two, nor could he ignore it. Some in the political world believe that Prime Minister Katayama may dismiss Hirano on the grounds of internal disunity in the cabinet. Also, the Democratic Party expressed shock at the unexpected deterioration of the situation. Chairman Ashida hoped that Hirano would respect himself and strive to prevent the situation from worsening.</p>

<p>Can Use British Pounds for Payment</p>
<p>〔Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th〕The British representative has reached an agreement with the Allied General Headquarters for a period of six months, allowing merchants from the United Kingdom, Australia, and various British colonies to purchase Japanese goods with British pounds. The payment will be preserved by the Japanese government in London, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The British government guarantees that when the Japanese side requests payment, the payment will be converted into U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate and paid. Officials from the Allied General Headquarters also announced that other relevant countries that can make the same guarantee can also trade with Japan in their own currency in the same way.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Prison Riot Has Not Subsided</p>
<p>Prison Cells Are Locked and on Full Alert All Day</p>
<p>More Than 100 Troublemaking Inmates Detained Separately</p>
<p>The Cause Was Extortion of 40 Million Yuan from Zhan Liansheng</p>
<p>〔Report from Our Paper〕The riot of prisoners in Shanghai Prison has not subsided as of yesterday. All prison cells have not been opened all day. The cause of this riot was that three prisoners, Shi Liangen, Zhou Xinglong, and Xu Daichang, who originally worked in the kitchen, extorted 40 million yuan from Zhan Yunsheng, which caused dissatisfaction among other prisoners, leading to the riot. The Shanghai Prison transferred Shi and others to the detention center of the Sinan Road District Court. The prison authorities, fearing that there were conspiratorial instigators among them, and inspected for weapons such as small knives and iron rulers, and compiled a blacklist of more than 100 people who usually liked to cause trouble. Starting at 7 AM yesterday, these more than 100 people were detained separately in the "He Prison" for investigation. Afterwards, they searched each prison cell and found a lot of cigarettes and</p>

<p>Yesterday, Minister Chen Arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing to Supervise the Joint Allocation of Cotton Yarn; China Textile's Cotton Purchase is Still Far from the Target</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday and met with Chairman Du of the Textile Federation regarding matters related to the joint allocation of cotton yarn. Mr. Chen also visited the Chrysanthemum Exhibition at Fuxing Park.</p>
<p>Another report: Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning to supervise the joint distribution of cotton yarn. Mr. Chen had previously visited Shanghai half a month ago for this purpose, but returned without success due to strong opposition from private yarn mills. The government now considers joint distribution imperative, and the National Economic Commission has also mandated the Ministry of Economic Affairs to take charge, so Mr. Chen came to Shanghai again yesterday to discuss matters with all parties.</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Mr. Chen immediately summoned Liu Siying, Acting Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, and Yuan Zhongda, Director of the Office, to inquire about the opinions of private yarn mills. In the afternoon, he visited Mr. Du Yuesheng to discuss the issue in detail.</p>
<p>Another report: China Textile Corporation has purchased 300,000 dan of domestic cotton this year. The company's original purchase target was 3,000,000 dan. According to the latest figures, this is only one-tenth of the total. With new cotton already entering the market continuously, it is feared that the original target will be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>The reasons are threefold:</p>
<p>Lack of cash: The company planned to use 6 trillion national currency to purchase 3 million dan of cotton, but cotton prices have risen in various regions, making it impossible to purchase without 12 trillion yuan. Farmers in various regions want cash during purchases and do not accept promissory notes or checks. It is not easy to exchange 6 trillion yuan in cash.</p>
<p>Due to the unrest in the situation, a large amount of cotton in various regions has been burned or damaged.</p>
<p>Traffic congestion: A large amount of cotton is stockpiled in Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Lingshi, and other places. Although it is being transported to Shanghai by air, the limited number of aircraft makes it difficult to transport it smoothly. Loose Credit and Healthy Appetite Lead to Continued Rise in Cotton Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>42-count Blue Phoenix Yarn Rises Another 1.5 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market experienced a surge due to loose credit and the healthy appetite of traders. Dyeing and weaving factories and various guilds continued to seek purchases. Furthermore, with few private factories opening, the market supply was scarce, leading to another surge in prices. Ultimately, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn continued to rise sharply, with an increase of 1.5 million to 36.5 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also saw increases ranging from 500,000 to over 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>In the cotton cloth market, the morning opened with scattered retail purchases. Merchants from Hankou and Chongqing were actively purchasing, and dyeing factories in the city were absorbing even more strongly. It was also rumored that the supply of the Textile Construction Company would decrease, and credit was unusually loose. All parties were enthusiastic, and prices soared. Subsequently, due to the presence of supervisory personnel at the market to monitor transactions, confidence weakened, and some short-term traders took profits, causing the market to decline slightly. However, as a result, 12-pound Longtou and other fine cloth grades were 7,000 to 15,000 yuan higher than the previous day, and other cloths also rose.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton market was firm. Credit was loose, and buying interest was strong. Yarn mills' appetite was moderate, and inter-dealer trading was more active. Furthermore, with prices rising sharply in the production areas, confidence was boosted. Prices were about 100,000 higher than the previous day, with 2,300 bales traded. The prices for factory delivery were: Lingbao 3.927 million, 3.968 million, Shashi 3.704 million, substandard 3.637 million, Chongsha 3.637 million to 3.704 million, Huoji 2.728 million, and Bailuo Qu 3.844 million, with 1,100 bales traded. The prices for warehouse delivery were: Lingbao 3.844 million, Shandong cotton 3.844 million, Han fine 3.513 million, Chongsha 3.472 million, Laohekou 3.43 million, and Tuolisi 3.844 million, with 1,200 bales traded, and Zhoupu seed cotton 660,000. China Trust's Imported Japanese Woolen Fabric is Still Being Negotiated for Export</p>
<p>Hong Kong Smuggled Goods Have Appeared on the Market</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] China Trust Bureau's 300,000 yards of Japanese woolen fabric imported through barter trade are still stored in warehouses. According to relevant sources, the plan is to export them and purchase wool raw materials for domestic industrial needs. The process is still under negotiation, with foreign governments as the target, not private merchants. However, due to the large amount of foreign exchange required, it will be difficult to achieve results in the short term. Australia is a wool-producing region, but it is not a suitable trading partner because it can process and weave wool itself. Before our country purchased from Japan, the British government had already imported 1.5 million yards and shipped them to Hong Kong, and then smuggled them into our country. This type of Japanese woolen fabric has already been found on the Shanghai market. In addition, 2,000 Japanese bicycles imported through barter trade have been shipped. Recently, the Trade Guidance Committee for Japan has decided to allocate them to various agencies, but according to sources from the China Trust Bureau, there is no news of this matter. The number of 2,000 is very small, and their purchase was also at the cost of our country's resources. If properly handled, it will also benefit the national treasury.</p>
<p>Army Uniform Cloth Sells Well</p>
<p>The woolen fabric market has been calm in recent days. There have been no major fluctuations in the prices quoted by tea houses and large wholesalers. The trend of thin woolen fabrics and serge has largely reached a point where they cannot rise further or fall. Army uniform cloth is selling quite well, but the price is relatively stable. The wholesale price for a whole original bolt is 650,000 yuan per yard, and for a set of one or two sets, the wholesale price is 570,000 to 580,000 yuan per yard. The only buyers are from the Xuzhou area, and their source is Hankou and Hong Kong. Rice Shops Become Active; Both Japonica and Indica Rice Prices Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday, a total of more than 12,900 shi of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The market situation saw a uniform and comprehensive rise in prices. Rice shops became active, with japonica rice rising by 10,000 yuan and indica rice rebounding by 20,000 yuan. Baoyuan and Xianyuan both increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour sales were surprisingly strong, rising by 7,000 to 10,000 yuan. Bran also rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Soybean cake from Shantou and Taiwan was eagerly sought and urgently loaded, rising sharply by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans from Southeast Asia were still in short supply, and merchants from Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Shantou were actively purchasing, leading to continued gains, with prices rising by more than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Kidney beans from Southeast Asia were actively traded, rising by 10,000 yuan. Red beans saw scattered trading and rebounded by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. However, broad beans were hesitant and remained lackluster. Corn from northern ports rebounded by 10,000 yuan for high-quality goods, while medium- and low-quality goods remained stable. Red sorghum saw scattered trading and rebounded from fatigue, rising by 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sesame oil factories were very eager to purchase, continuing to rise by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, with the situation gradually rising. Shelled peanuts saw aggressive purchases from Shaoxing, and merchants from Bang also made inquiries, with prices jumping by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan in the middle, and high-quality goods from Beijing also rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Oil shops were bustling, with all types of oil rebounding. Raw oil rose sharply by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, soybean oil followed suit, rising by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, vegetable oil increased by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and sesame oil also rebounded by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Sugar Prices Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a rebound in prices due to the easing of credit. The association's quotations for 24 coarse white sugar initially stood at 910,000 yuan, then rose to 940,000 yuan and 45,000 yuan, an increase of approximately 50,000. 20 medium sand white sugar was priced at 860,000 yuan to 878,000 yuan and 880,000 yuan. The opening price for goods from Shantou and Qingdao was 740,000 to 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, cotton red high-quality goods were 850,000 yuan, ordinary goods were 800,000 yuan, and Shunde Qing was 720,000 yuan, totaling several hundred packages. High-quality white bagged goods from Xinghua were 920,000 yuan, and ordinary goods were 900,500 yuan. Hainan red was 780,000 yuan, totaling more than 300 pieces. Diao Qing was 740,000 yuan to 750,000 yuan, totaling several hundred packages. Banks and Bureaus Run Deficits; Credit Continues to Ease</p>
<p>[Our Newspaper Report] Credit continued to ease yesterday. According to sources from the Central Bank, credit may tighten next week. Yesterday, the four banks and two bureaus still ran a deficit of 69.4 billion, with the Bank of China running a deficit of 57.1 billion, the Central Farmers Bank running a deficit of 6.1 billion, the China Trust Bureau running a deficit of 5.55 billion, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau running a deficit of 6.1 billion, and the Cooperative Treasury running a deficit of 600 million. The National Bank had a surplus of 16 billion, the Bank of Communications had a surplus of 40.2 billion, the Great Exchange Houses had a surplus of 15.5 billion, foreign banks had a surplus of 41.6 billion, and small exchange houses had a surplus of 12.3 billion. The dark interest rate was 1.7%, and the stock discount rate was 1.8%. Buyers Make Strenuous Efforts to Support; Chinese Stocks Remain Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, sentiment in the Chinese stock market was mixed, and demand fluctuated. Although stable, it was doubly difficult. The participation of new short sellers diluted buying interest, and the continued tightening of off-market audits hindered the upward trend. The Hong Kong exchange rate shrank again, and absorption from the Guangdong region was still supportive. The future awaits new stimulus. Trading in Wuhe was sparse and fell for many days. Yesterday, it rebounded to the limit, while most stocks saw slight gains or losses.</p>
<p>Morning Start</p>
<p>The market opened higher due to the Ministry of Finance's expression of agreement to reduce deposit margins. Yongsha opened at 322 yuan and 315 yuan and sold down to 307 yuan and 315 yuan before rising to 312 yuan and 318 yuan. Off-market audits hindered buying interest and pushed the price down to 307 yuan and 311 yuan. Wuhe rose to the limit, pushing the price up to an intraday high of 314 yuan and a deferred high of 319 yuan. China United Cement led small stocks and also rose to a high of 116 yuan. The off-market interest rate remained at 1.35% and 1.8%, which had no impact, but trading was once sluggish, with intraday Sanhe falling to 305 yuan and deferred falling to 308 yuan. Hong Kong Shen Telegraph fell to 5.5 yuan, and Guangdong merchants bought in, pushing the price up to 311 yuan and 315 yuan near noon. After vigorous selling, the upward trend was hindered, and Yongsha closed at 308 yuan and 310 yuan. The morning close saw slight gains in intraday Yongsha, Xinyi, Huaxin, Rongfeng, National Products Cement, and Xinyi, a half-cent gain in Datong, a 10% gain in Hengfeng, a limit gain in Wuhe, and unchanged prices in Qinxing, Sino-French, America Asia, Anshui, and Ye. Xinguang, Yefu, Yonggong, Jinglun, Match, Huafeng, Sino-Silk, Zhongfen, and Tongyi saw declines. Deferred stocks saw slight gains in Yongsha and America Asia, declines in Huafeng, and unchanged prices in Xinyi, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing. Off-market old stocks were stable, and China and World each gained half a cent. Industrial Raw Material Allocation Should Be Improved</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper Report) According to statistics from relevant authorities: The industrial raw materials that are currently in the greatest shortage in the country are dinitrochlorobenzene, caustic soda, tinplate, black iron sheet, phosphorus, potassium chlorate, wood pulp, etc. The import quotas for these raw materials should be appropriately increased. There are also imbalances and unfairness in the allocation of raw materials to various factories through various associations. The government should have a fixed policy for the import and allocation of industrial raw materials in the future, increase the supply to military industries and important people's livelihood industries, and conduct detailed investigations of the production volume of each factory. A dedicated institution should be responsible for the allocation to achieve the goal of fairness and reasonableness. The measures taken by the Hong Kong government in this type of matter are quite worthy of reference. The local authorities have already made detailed statistics of the production volume of each factory, and this is used as the standard when approving foreign exchange sales. All factories that have been approved for foreign exchange are required to add a profit of 30% to the cost when wholesaling and selling their finished products, and merchants add another 30% when retailing. The combined profit is quite generous under stable currency prices, but enforcement is strict. If there are those who do not comply with the regulations, the goods will be confiscated and the responsible person will be sent to court for prosecution. The above method has been very effective. If our country wants to emulate it, we only need to supplement the method with a measure to address the depreciation of currency value, and the rest will be applicable. Unified Bonds Stable; Foreign Stocks Rise</p>
<p>Government bonds were stable with little change. Room 360 and Room 628 bought in, while Room 552 and Room 503 had supply. Unified C opened at 21,600 yuan in the morning, with a high price of no more than 22,200 yuan, and then leveled off slightly. As a result, Grade A and Grade B rose by 400 yuan, Unified C rose by 100 yuan, Unified D rose by 400 yuan, and Unified E was flat. Trading volume was around 7 million.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continued to advance yesterday amid further contraction of the Hong Kong exchange rate. Yisha reached a high price again, and Yibi benefited from dividend distribution, which rose even more. Securities firms in Guangdong actively bought in, and foreign firms had supply. Yisha opened at 213,000 yuan in the morning, with a high price of only 217,000 yuan, and then leveled off. The rise and fall were limited. As a result, Jardine Matheson and Zhisheng rose by half a cent, and Yibi, Yeguang, and Xiangtai each rose by about 10%. The rest saw small gains. 300,000 Pounds of American Tobacco Leaves from Taiwan Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>American tobacco leaves produced in Taiwan are of very good quality. The local tobacco merchants association believes that the province has abundant tobacco production and good quality. At a time when the transportation of tobacco leaves from Henan Province is hindered and American tobacco is not allowed to be imported, if the local government can be authorized to allow the surplus tobacco leaves from Taiwan Province to be transported to Shanghai, it would be welcomed by cigarette factories. Therefore, it has sent a letter to the Taiwan Materials Adjustment Committee and submitted it to the Taiwan Provincial Government for approval. Subsequently, the Taiwan Provincial Materials Adjustment Committee replied that the person in charge of the Public Sales Bureau stated that as soon as the Taiwan tobacco industry has surplus tobacco leaves in addition to its own use in the province, they can be shipped to Shanghai. According to tobacco industry news, the Taiwan Provincial Public Sales Bureau recently shipped 300,000 pounds of aged tobacco leaves from Taiwan to Shanghai for sale. Initially, it was offered to various Chinese cigarette factories, but the transaction failed due to price disagreement. Finally, it was sold to a Chinese company operated by a foreign company in the city for 35,000 yuan per pound, with a total value of 10.5 billion. It is said that this year's new tobacco will continue to be shipped and sold one after another. Not Lacking High Prices Sought for Sale; Rayon Prices Weaken Again After Rising</p>
<p>Mill-Made Silk and Silk Goods Buying Interest Are Very Strong</p>

The highest Monday price was 90 million yuan, and the selling price had fallen to 7.5 million yuan by noon. The decline continued in the afternoon, with the final selling price being 6 million yuan, with little difference from the price of the previous day.</p>
<p>Mill-Made Silk</p>

<p>Application Forms Submitted to the Bureau for Review</p>
<p>(Our Newspaper Report) A spokesperson for the China Trust Bureau claimed yesterday that the bureau allocates rayon based on the application forms submitted by various associations and factories, including the number of machines and the amount of silk required. On October 15th and 16th, the bureau convened various relevant associations to openly discuss the ratio of each association in order to be fair. At present, various associations have prepared new application forms based on this ratio and are sending them to the bureau one after another. The bureau now stipulates that these forms should still be reviewed in detail. Those in this city should be sent to the Shanghai Social Bureau for review, and it has been decided that:</p>
<p>Allocation will be made according to the new ratio in the second week of this month.</p>
<p>If the review is not completed by the second week of this month, allocation will be made at 4% of the new ratio first.</p>
<p>Allocation will be suspended during the review period, and it will be allowed to be made up when allocation continues. Foreign Tea Traders Have Few Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market, exporters negotiated with suppliers for export tea, but it was difficult to reach an agreement, so the number of transactions was only sporadic. In terms of price, except for Wenzhou merchants who raised the price by 100,000 yuan per dan, other merchants in Sui'an raised prices by about 50,000 yuan, and the base price was quite firm. As for domestic sales of fancy tea, the buying interest from shops in the city was not inferior to the previous day, but the insistence of the main holders became more and more intensified, so the supply and demand gradually became unbalanced, and the transaction fell sharply. The situation continued to be tense. Second District Match Association Requests Allocation of Raw Materials</p>

<p>Fifth Anniversary of the Passing of Master Hongyi by Weng Guiyue</p>
<p>It has been five years since Master Hongyi passed away. Tomorrow, his friends and disciples will hold a memorial service for him at the Jade Buddha Temple, and his posthumous calligraphy will also be exhibited.</p>
<p>The Master's secular surname was Li, his given name was Shutong. He once studied in Japan and devoted himself to promoting new art after returning to China. He can be called the founder of new art in China. He was good at calligraphy, and his regular script can be called unique in modern times. He acted in dramas, worked as an editor in newspapers, and also taught, making great contributions to the new art scene. When he abandoned his teaching position and quietly went to Hupao Temple to become a monk, his friends, his students, and people who loved his art were all surprised, thinking that he had been stimulated to some extreme degree, so he became negative and became a monk. At that time, his family rushed to the temple to kneel down and beg him to return to secular life, but they were all rejected by him. He was determined to convert. His cultivation after becoming a monk tells us that he was not negative. He always had compassion in his heart, thought of all living beings, and wanted to awaken the living beings in the haze and lead them to the other shore. Therefore, he did not leave the world, he was still in the world. It's just that his work of saving the world is invisible.</p>
<p>Although the Master has been dead for five years, his art is immortal, and his virtue is always green like the green hills! Answer to the Question by Wang Pingling</p>
<p>Why is the corruption trend in China more prevalent in later generations? Mr. Gu Yanwu of Kunshan has a good answer to this question. He said: "The reason why modern corrupt officials are more than those in the Tang and Song dynasties is not because the officials in the Tang and Song dynasties were honest, but because they are poorer today. It is because the currency in the Tang and Song dynasties was copper coins, and the currency in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties was silver. Coins are heavy and difficult to move, while silver is light and easy to carry. It is difficult to transport, so even taking a little is considered a lot, and it is easy to transport, so even taking a lot is considered a little."</p>
<p>Indeed, it is not very convenient to carry more than 100,000 strings of copper coins back home to enjoy prosperity. Tang and Song were famous for corrupt officials. Even if they could collect a room full of copper coins, converted into today's numbers, it would be worth at most ten US dollars on the black market. How convenient it is to carry ten US dollars. Copper coins are a rigid metal, with sound and color, and are more easily reported. If you encounter an iron-faced and selfless official like Liu Chong of the Eastern Han Dynasty, even if your own son takes a five-铢 coin from the warehouse and wears it on his earlobe as a game, he will be punished for corruption and beheaded to show the public. This makes ancient civil servants who intend to collect copper coins have to be careful. Today, since the issuance of 10,000 yuan banknotes, the black market for US dollars has also risen sharply. Each bundle is 1 billion or 100 billion. Although the numbers have increased, the quantity is still not large. If Mr. Gu Yanwu were alive today, he would inevitably sigh and say based on his new discovery: "Alas! The prevalence of corruption, I don't know where it will end!"</p>
<p>Moreover, (that is my opinion.) Ancient civil servants, even if they collected a boat or a dou of copper coins, would at most build more houses and land. Now, if they collect US dollars, they can live in foreign houses, drive cars, arrange a large number of concubines and mistresses, and live a leisurely life. Therefore, since people are not sages, who can avoid vulgarity? If there is an opportunity, why not take it? If you succeed, you can enjoy it for a lifetime, and if you fail, you will not be beheaded to show the public.</p>
<p>In addition, today's society is obsessed with money. As long as you have money, who will verify the origin of the money? Even if corrupt people are ashamed of their conscience, it will not harm everything about themselves. If they can show a little compassion to the countless poor people trapped on the starvation line and take one-ten-thousandth of the total wealth, then the beautiful name of doing good deeds and helping those in need will still be praised everywhere and spread throughout the universe. Therefore, the status of corrupt people can be respected by all aspects of society even more because of the increase in US dollars and gold. In this situation, hoping that civil servants do not want money is much more difficult than hoping that soldiers are not afraid of death. The authorities must ensure that civil servants do not want money and must make civil servants afraid of death.</p>
<p>Cherishing life and fearing death is human nature. Anyone who wants money must be afraid of death, because they must first live in order to give full play to the wonderful use of money. Today's corrupt people have personally discovered that there are many people who want money, and none of them have been killed. They are always successful everywhere and good at using their connections; while a very small number of people who really do not want money are thrown into the 18th level of hell and can never raise their heads again. These realistic lessons are projected in front of them like shadows on a screen. Why don't they be more realistic, seize the opportunity, and never let go, doing everything to their heart's content! But if they can be iron-faced and selfless, enforce the law like a mountain, and do not give discounts, so that "those who want money must die," and absolutely fear death, they will never dare to "try the law." I think there may be people who "want money but don't want life," but there are definitely not many.</p>
<p>Because of the fear of death, they dare not want money. At the same time, they should eliminate extravagance as much as possible so that the rich cannot indulge in their enjoyment of horses, dogs, voices, and colors. On the one hand, they should advocate frugality, value academics, and encourage the development of production. In a certain period, they will be able to change customs and gradually create an atmosphere of not wanting money. Further, they will encourage civil servants to dedicate themselves to the country, embrace the spirit of "not being afraid of death," work hard to govern, use only the virtuous, and bring the world to a prosperous age of peace. Experimental Factory for Students Studying in the United States by Liangzai</p>
<p>Linden, NJ, in New Jersey, USA. On the wall of a building, there are several Chinese characters forcefully embedded: "China Engine Manufacturing Plant." This is a "self-owned" Chinese factory on American soil.</p>
<p>This factory originally belonged to the US Navy Department during the war. Chinese engineering students studying in the United States took a fancy to it. They hoped to turn it into an experimental factory, manage themselves, and work themselves to seek technological advancement. As a result of discussions, a donation was launched. After many efforts, more than 1,000 overseas Chinese scattered in the United States, Canada, and Latin America finally supported and purchased this factory.</p>
<p>After reaching an understanding with the United Electrical Workers Union U.E.W., they officially started construction. Except for a few American workers, the important technical management work was almost all undertaken by these promising young students. They wore greasy work clothes and operated enthusiastically. Sometimes they had to discuss difficult problems and learn from each other at the dining table.</p>
<p>The "China Engine Manufacturing Plant" is now limited in production due to the difficulty of purchasing steel. It can produce about 2,000 to 2,500 engines per month, which are used exclusively to assemble refrigerators. They plan to expand again to reach the goal of producing 6,000 units per month.</p>
<p>The words "China Engine Manufacturing Plant" were written by Dr. Hu Shi. The big blue sky and white sun national emblem added by the students on the wall also emits a dazzling light in the sun. Humor of the Direct Tax Bureau by Simang</p>
<p>A few days ago, in a friend's office, I accidentally found several forms, which were the "Consolidated Income Tax Total Income Report Form" of the Direct Tax Bureau. Among them, two items were particularly ridiculous, one was the living expenses of direct relatives, and the other was the education expenses of children in middle schools and above. The living expenses of direct relatives are 100,000 yuan, and the education expenses of children are 50,000 yuan. I don't know what standard this is based on? It is probably that the person who set the standard still thinks that the current prices have returned to the situation ten years ago. If he set it according to the current situation, then 100,000 yuan can buy a little more than one dou of rice, and 50,000 yuan can buy an ordinary textbook. If it is</p>

<h3>Discussion on the Issue of Popularly Elected County Magistrates by Chu Tze-run</h3>
<p>Our nation's constitution is scheduled to be implemented on December 25th, which is not far off. With little time remaining, the entire country is actively preparing for general elections so that constitutional governance can be implemented as scheduled. However, the foundation of constitutional governance lies in local autonomy. Therefore, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Kuomintang, held in March of this year, passed a resolution on preparations for the implementation of constitutional governance, also emphasizing local autonomy. Article 8 stipulated: "In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, draft general rules for provincial and county autonomy, accelerate the implementation of local autonomy, and implement popularly elected county magistrates." Recently, the Ministry of Interior is drafting "General Rules for Provincial and County Autonomy," "Law on the Election and Recall of County Magistrates," and "Implementing Regulations," submitting them to the 20th Executive Yuan regular meeting for discussion. This article discusses the issue of popularly elected county magistrates and provides some opinions for the authorities to adopt.</p>
<p>That county magistrates should be popularly elected is, in principle, beyond doubt; and implementing popular elections for county magistrates is a prerequisite for implementing county autonomy. Only then will the ideal of popular sovereignty not be empty talk, and democratic politics will have a foundation. We believe that after the popular election of county magistrates, the reform of county administration will have at least the following two advantages: After county magistrates are changed from being appointed to being popularly elected, the people will naturally have the right to remove county magistrates who violate the law and neglect their duties at any time. With the power of appointment and removal in the hands of the people, county magistrates will naturally have to take seriously the reasonable demands of the people, and the greedy and despicable acts of harming the people and enriching themselves by exploiting government orders will not be as unscrupulous as in the past when county magistrates were appointed by higher-level authorities. A democratic oversight system can be established, and the trend of corruption can be slightly curbed. Only in this way can there be hope for clarifying officialdom. County magistrates elected by the people should be more harmonious with the people than appointed county magistrates. Lower-level situations are easier to convey to higher levels, and autonomous work and all measures should be more in line with the people's sentiments. It is easier to gain the trust and support of the people, and government affairs can be promoted more conveniently, resulting in the benefits of smooth governance and harmonious human relations.</p>
<p>However, the popular election of county magistrates may give rise to various malpractices in the initial stage of implementation, which we must carefully consider. The people do not have sufficient training in exercising the four rights and often do not value this sacred right to vote, and exercise it casually. Therefore, in the current situation, implementing popular elections for county magistrates inevitably leads to numerous malpractices, such as acting on emotions, voting as a favor, or arbitrarily abandoning the right to vote. As a result, those elected become ambitious individuals who campaign in various ways. It is difficult to achieve the ideal standard of selecting the virtuous and capable. The people's cultural level is too low, and they lack the ability to understand and distinguish the political views of candidates, and do not know how they affect the vital interests of public organizations. They often prioritize localism or are compelled by feudal forces, clan concepts, traditional ideas, and stubborn prejudices, and are unwilling to sacrifice personal interests for the benefit of society. The task of the county magistrate is not only to handle the inherent affairs of the county corporation (autonomous affairs), but also to be directed by the provincial government to handle the entrusted affairs of the central government and the province. Therefore, the county magistrate is, on the one hand, the head of local autonomy in the county, and on the other hand, an administrative official, a criminal prosecutor, a conscription officer, a police officer, and also the head of the national guard, the head of the land tax and food administration office, conscripting soldiers and food, demanding the people's money, demanding the people's lives, all of which must be "strong before they can be done." In terms of logic and reason, popularly elected county magistrates often take reducing the burden on the people as a reward for the people's support. Therefore, they inevitably have a perfunctory and procrastinating attitude toward entrusted matters, using sympathy for the people's difficulties as an excuse to please the masses, resulting in the abandonment of all government affairs and a complete lack of progress, inevitably affecting the promotion of national policy.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned difficulties are inevitable. Therefore, some people advocate adopting an indirect election system instead of the direct method, while others advocate restricting the right to be elected through examinations to remedy the shortcomings of direct elections. However, Article 126 of the new Constitution stipulates: "County magistrates shall be elected by the people of the county." The method of election is based on Article 129 of the Constitution: "Various elections stipulated in this Constitution shall, unless otherwise specified in this Constitution, be conducted by universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot." Since the method of popular election of county magistrates is not specifically stipulated in the Constitution, the direct election method should naturally be adopted; otherwise, it would violate the Constitution. Therefore, the direct election method for popular election of county magistrates cannot be abandoned because of a minor setback, and should not be changed. Even if direct elections inevitably lead to malpractices at present, the people should still be allowed to learn in practice.</p>
<p>As for restricting the qualifications of candidates for county magistrate through examinations to remedy the shortcomings of direct elections, the Ministry of Interior can represent this view. It believes that the first thing to consider when planning for popular elections of county magistrates is the issue of qualifications for candidates, and believes that it is necessary to adopt examination methods in both law and fact. In addition to handling county autonomy, county magistrates also have the responsibility of executing the entrusted affairs of the central government and the province. When executing entrusted affairs, their position is completely consistent with that of ordinary civil servants. Therefore, when implementing popular elections of county magistrates, examinations should be conducted first to determine the qualifications of candidates, and then the people should vote and elect them, so that respect for public opinion is still combined with the intention of selecting the virtuous and capable, which is in line with the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, which advocates using the examination system to remedy the shortcomings of the election system. However, according to the new Constitution, the examination system is not adopted for various fake candidates. That is, the National Government's Measures for Examination and Review of Candidates for Public Office, previously promulgated by the National Government, has also been explicitly abolished by the National Government, and the review of candidates for public office in various places has long been suspended. Now, singling out the qualifications of candidates for county magistrate requires first passing an examination, which is not only without any basis in the Constitution, but also obviously unfair. Therefore, at the recent Executive Yuan meeting discussing this case, some people advocated avoiding the use of the words "examination to determine qualifications" for candidates for county magistrate to avoid constitutional conflicts. Instead, a list of positive and negative qualifications should be stipulated in the County Magistrate Election Law as a supplement. However, the author believes that there are still problems with this point and does not dare to agree. According to the election laws for various elected personnel formulated based on the new Constitution, there are no restrictions on the positive qualifications of candidates. Now, imposing strict restrictions on the qualifications of candidates for county magistrate alone seems unfair.</p>
<p>So how should the problem be solved? In the author's opinion, the candidate nomination method should be adopted. To improve the qualifications of candidates for county magistrate, holding examinations is not allowed by the Constitution, and listing positive qualifications in the election law is also impossible in practice. Therefore, the only option is to adopt the candidate nomination method. In the current election of National Assembly representatives and legislators, there are two types of nominations: voter nomination and party nomination. This can not only reduce the costs of campaigning, reduce unnecessary infighting between candidates, but also promote social justice and promote social opinion. Therefore, to prevent the drawbacks of popular elections of county magistrates, it seems that the nomination method can be adopted. What is the method? It is nothing more than (1) County residents' nomination, which must be signed by a certain number of voters in the county; (2) County council nomination, which must be signed by a certain number of councilors; (3) Nomination by the provincial government, which supervises autonomy. It seems that nomination by the provincial government has the suspicion of the higher-level government taking over the election. It is also not easy for voters without election experience to nominate suitable and ideal candidates. Therefore, among the three, the county council nomination seems to be the best. After the county council nominates, the voters elect. In terms of law and reason, it is more appropriate. The quality of county councilors is higher, and the candidates they nominate are naturally more suitable. There is no name for examination or restriction of candidate qualifications, but the reality of improving candidate qualifications.</p>
<h3>Gong Xuesui's Report in Beijing</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 1) Gong said: The Dalian Municipal Government is still exiled in Shenyang. The people of Dalian are eagerly awaiting the reunion with their country, and more than 50,000 people have left Dalian to embrace the motherland. They are all intellectuals who understand the country and the international situation. However, in the Northeast, where there is a surplus of talent, even finding a job as a sweeper is impossible today, so they have no choice but to become beggars or servants. They are suffering from the fact that they have gone from enjoying a comfortable life in the past to becoming refugees. He said that he himself is a "Mayor of Difficult People," and will continue to be a "Mayor of Refugees" in the future. He will lead this group of difficult people into Dalian when the Dalian issue is resolved, and the power that will be generated will be very great. He said: I can say that these people can be worth 100,000 soldiers, and we can use this to win over the hearts of the people in Dalian. He came to Beijing this time to appeal for emergency relief for these more than 50,000 refugees. After arriving in Beijing, he has received the support of Mo Dehui, Shen Yi, and others, and will launch a fundraising campaign. The fundraising target in Beijing is 200 million national currency. (The overall target is 200 million circulation vouchers, equivalent to 2.3 billion national currency.) In addition to Beijing, Cheng Qiuyue is currently holding a charity performance in Beiping, and Tianjin can obtain 400 million yuan through holding art exhibitions and ball games. Xi is scheduled to go to Shanghai in a few days to carry out fundraising work, and will return to the Northeast after completion.</p>

<h3>Source of Glass Found in Yu Zisan Suicide Case</h3>
<p>Students at Jinling University Boycott Classes for One Day</p>
<p>[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 8th] Zhejiang University President Zhu Kezhen returned to Hangzhou from Beijing yesterday. He told reporters that after returning to Hangzhou, he heard that the court had sent personnel to the Security Command to search under the floor of Yu Zisan's room in the original detention center and found more than a dozen pieces of broken glass. The blood glass was pieced together to form about two-thirds of the window glass, which revealed that the source of the blood glass was window glass fragments that had been discarded under the floor and accidentally exposed in the gap between the floor and the wall. With this clarification, one point of doubt in this case can be reduced. As for the details of Zisan's arrest and tragic death, the school has already sent pictures to be published in various newspapers. The oral conversations in various newspapers are often reported differently. It is hoped that the court will publicly conclude the case as soon as possible so that the truth will come out.</p>

<h3>Handling the Aftermath of the Democratic League; Internal Notification to All Localities to Comply</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The government announced that the Democratic League is an illegal organization and notified the public security authorities of all provinces and cities. The League immediately appointed Mr. Huang Yanpei to come to Beijing to negotiate with the government on the conclusion and aftermath of the Democratic League. The government presented three points, and Mr. Huang raised two requests, which were also answered by the government, as reported in the newspapers. The original text of the telegram issued by the Ministry of Interior to all provincial and municipal public security agencies for compliance in accordance with government instructions is as follows:</p>
<p>"After the government announced that the Democratic League was an illegal organization, this department issued instructions to comply. Subsequently, the League appointed Huang Yanpei as a representative to come to Beijing to negotiate with the government on the conclusion and aftermath of the Democratic League. The government proposed the following measures: The government has announced that the Democratic League is an illegal organization and hopes that the League will end on its own and relieve the responsible persons of their responsibilities. Regarding housing: 1. The houses and objects of the Communist Party that are managed by the Democratic League shall be handed over to the government for acceptance immediately. 2. The houses owned by the Democratic League can be accepted. 3. The houses allocated to the Democratic League by the government should be returned. If they cannot be moved out temporarily, they can be temporarily borrowed. 4. The personal residences of League members will not be interfered with. 5. The houses on Zhu Baosan Road in Shanghai that are held by the Democratic League on behalf of the Communist Party will also be accepted by the government. If the school cannot move out temporarily, another borrowing method should be discussed. Huang also requested two points: 1. All League members in various places should be exempt from registration and enjoy all legal freedoms. 2. If the government believes that League members in various places have illegal activities, or those who have been arrested for cases, the government will handle them according to law. If there is no factual evidence of Communist Party membership, the measures for handling the Communist Party in the rear area will not be used. The government has replied as follows: If the Democratic League can follow the official announcement released by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior to dissolve itself and cease activities, the registration procedures for League members in various places can be exempted, and legal freedom will be guaranteed. However, if there are any illegal activities in the future under the guise of the name, the public security organs in various places should still handle them according to law. If the judicial organs determine, based on the results of the investigation, that League members arrested in cases are not members of the Communist Party or are not Communist Party workers, the provisions of the measures for handling the Communist Party in the rear area may not be applied. It is urgently requested that this be circulated for compliance."</p>
