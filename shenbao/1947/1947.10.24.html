<p>〔本報南京廿三日電〕政府對物價管制已開始進行，最先實行者爲花紗花布之管制，實行花紗布聯合配銷，全經會廿三日午後舉行二次會時，對此已有全盤決定，並定廿四日起在滬區實施。此次管制，主要係根據以前所通過之發展紡織工業，調節紗布供應。實施方案耍點如下：　關於紗布價格，依方案實行機動合理議價。　依方案之規定實行統籌收購國棉，並聯合議價</p>
<p>茲誌棉紗憑蹬聯合配銷綱要全文如次：　國營民營各紗廠所產棉紗，除繳交政府之棉紗，並供軍用及外銷暨自行織布實際所需者外，其餘應悉數依憑證配銷之方式，實行聯合酊銷。　經濟部紡調會听控制代紡棉紗，亦悉數加入聯合酊銷。　紡調會原設有之成品配銷小組委會，改組爲棉紗聯合配銷委會，負責辦理棉紗憑證配銷事宜。　棉紗憑證酊銷，應由聯配會參酌存紗數量，按月先期預定酊銷總額。　關於聯合配銷之詳細辦法，應依據本會實施方案第四章第二節第一·二·三項之規定，由聯配會擬訂，報經紡調會核轉經濟部備案。　本綱要先自上海區實施，逐漸推行於全國各地，統交經部核定，飭紡調會從速實施。</p>
<p>全經會除通過花紗布聯合配銷外，尚通過如下要案：　國營事業管理法，該法共三十五條，要點爲。國營事業應依企業方式式繩營，力求有盈無虧，最低亦應以自給自足爲準，年終如有盈餘，應解繳國庫，如有虧損，應報由主管機關由國庫撥補。　修改國營事業出售監理委會組織規程。主要修正爲第三條至第五條，內規定本委會設主委·副主委各一人，委員十一人，由全經會聘任之，副主委得爲專任，並得聘請專家九人至十一人爲顧問。</p>

<h3>如何挽救世界的危機？</h3>
<p>對於自卑心理與悲觀氣氣的清算</p>
<p>由於聯合國大會席上美蘇兩國代表針鋒相對的指實，以及東京盟軍統師麥克阿　管制日本的過於寬大，使中國論壇上最近發生了一種恐　悲觀的論調，好像三次世界大戰馬上臨頭，而中國也就將在此未來的大戰游渦中覆沒一般。大公報最近所載黃炎培氏的「怎樣挽救未來世界嚴重危機？」，和轉載王芸生氏的「麥克阿瑟手上的一顆石子」這兩篇文字，可認爲最顯著的例子。他們倆都指斥麥帥的扶助日本，並預言將來日本軍閥在第三次世界大戰中，將重在我國東北登陸，一面與蘇聯作戰，一面也就對中國直接執行「防共」以至「剿共」的任務。這種論調，不僅充滿了自卑的心理與悲觀的氣氛，忘却了中國在戰後國際舞臺上所處的地位，而且還隱含着强烈的毒素，迷惑了一般讀者的眼睛，使他們看不淸今後世界局勢的發展，以致墮入苦悶悲觀的深淵。</p>
<p>我們如果眞要研究今後世界局勢的危機所在，並進而尋求挽救的方法，那一定先得認淸戰後以至目前的國際形勢。而最重要的一點，在推測世界大局演變的許多因素中，千萬不應該忘却了中國自己的一切。因爲，無論如何，中國經過八年的長期血戰，對於世界大局，至少對於遠東大局，自有其獨立不倚的發言權。</p>
<p>放眼看看戰後的世界，自德日投絳大戰結束以來，已逾兩年，戰時世人所憶憬的和平民主的新時代，不僅沒有降臨人問，而且眞正的和平，似乎因爲盟國之間也有若際若現的沾染了侵略國家色彩的作風，離開世界更加渺茫。尤其在新共產國際出現之後，使世界兩大陣營的對立，髣髴格外顯而易見。這種可悲的現象，誠然要使　望戰後和平的人們，不免大失所望。但是從大局看來，決不能認爲今日已到了第三次大戰爆發的前夕，更不能斷言第三次大戰的性質一定就是美蘇兩大集團的鬥爭。記得在第一次大戰行將結束之際，蘇聯即發生社會革命，不但單獨與德國媾和，並以蘇維埃政體與世界各國相見；迨至大戰結束，世界各國對於蘇聯大半表示不滿，不僅與蘇聯沒有樹立外交關係，而且均　蘇聯爲洪水猛獸。於是一般政論家那時都替這個世界担憂，並一致認爲下一次大戰的性質，必將爲社會主義國家與資本主義國家間的戰爭。但是歷史是最好的證明，不僅這種憂慮未成事實，而且蘇聯在第二次大戰中，初期則與納粹機國訂立互不侵犯協定而守中立，後來則一變而　美英美結成盟友，駢肩作戰，同生共死，獲得晨後勝利。所以，看看今日的世界形數，想想第一次大戰後的情景，對於目前的世界，實在不必過分悲觀與恐懼；而馬上武斷立刻要來的第三次世界大戰必定是美蘇戰爭，也未免看得太簡單而又太嚴　了。</p>
<p>若再回顯瞧瞧今日的中國，我們更不可抱着自卑的心理，認爲今後在國際舞合上仍是「我爲魚肉，人爲刀俎」的痛心之局。這次八年抗戰，不僅給我們寶貴的敎訓，而且喚醒了民族的靈魂；今日之中國，現狀雖不能令人滿意，但究非一九一九年後之中國可比。回想當年，遠東的國際形勢，除了蘇聯致力於物質建設無暇他顧而外，殊少變化，我們的敵人日本，在大戰之後，跋巵飛揚，益增强其對於中國侵略的氣燄。而且我國國內軍閥，割據一方，勇於內戰而怯於外鬥，不知國家爲何物，根本談不到如何準備以應付未來的巨變。所以第二次大戰，遂因日本侵略中國而爆發。但是，由於國民政府的完成北伐，統一全國，忍辱負重，堅强抵抗，故二次大戰到底因日本的屈膝投降而終了。至於今日的中國，雖因共匪作亂禍國，全國尚未能從安定中求進步，踏上建國復興的大道，但國民政府一方旣已決心走向民主大道，一方毅然動員，戡亂救國，不論外援之有無，自不難於一年半載之內，肅淸共匪，完成統一，以爲扺禦外侮之準備。這個光明的　景，必能鼓勵全國人民在蔣主席領導之下，共同努力，向前邁進。中國歷史上儘多農民　動，然而一旦成了流寇，那是已經注定了失敗的命運。共匪之不足爲中國患，因爲共匪是流寇之外，再加「國賊」的性質，是決不容於中國民族的。</p>
<p>其次，戰後國際組織，首推聯合國機構，其任務在促進國際間的諒解與合作，後而維持世界和平，而其最有效的機構，就是安全理事會，中國也就是五常任理事國之一，對於任何國際問題的解決，　有行使否決權的特權，與英，美，法，蘇的地位完全一樣。我們中國在戰後最關切的間題，莫過於對日和約；處理對日問題的遠東委員會，中國也是有行使否決權的四强之一，中國對於日本問題的任何意見，別國都應特別加以尊重。所以中國可謂遠東唯一的安定力量，對於世界和平的維持自有極大作用，誰也不能否認。英美所以要希望中國能成爲統一强大民主的國家，其用意也就是要中國能成爲遠東最大的安定勢力，從而促進世界的和平。友邦人士對於我國尚抱着極大的期望，自己怎能妄自菲薄，反而認爲美蘇兩國可以決定世界的一切呢？</p>
<p>戰後中國，爲欲在和平中埋頭建國計，爲欲在安定中求進步計，無往而不求國際問的和平，亦無往而不求國內的安定。美蘇的分道揚鑣，自非吾人所樂聞；何况中國對於美蘇，一視同仁，更願見其化除意氣。美國是我國的患難盟友，戰時曾援助我國對日作戰，戰後我們仍希望美國能協助我國復興建國，共同維持遠東的和平；同樣，蘇聯也是我們的朋友，且訂有同盟友好條約，只要蘇聯能够恪守遵行條約的義務，中蘇問的一切問題也就不難獲得合理的解決。我們處在美蘇之間，不但不願見此兩大盟邦之互相責難，而且常欲以橋樑自居，從而促進美蘇的合作。我國代表在任何國際會議中，常常提出調和美蘇意見的建議，就是一個有力的明證。姑無論我們的願望是否能輕易實現，但是只要中國努力自强，當然有此資格。</p>
<p>上所述，可知中國在國際上的地位，今非昔比，只要我們自已不自　，不怯懦，全國一致，消滅那自暴自棄的破壞力量，則我們就大可發揮我們安定遠東的志願。惟有我們自己爭氣，集中一切力量，迅速擊破共匪在東北製造國際亂源的企圖，則此星星之火就不致燎原之處。所以我們若要挽救未來世界的危機，若要防杜日本侵略的再起，唯有中國政府掌握東北的主機。目前國軍在東北所進行的戰爭，不僅其目的就在於消滅國際的亂源，而且對於美蘇衝突也將發生緩和的作用，絕對不會有日軍重在我們東北登陸的事實發生。在日本人，如果抱此野心，不過是一種狂妄的幻想；至若我們中國人唱此論調，那就變成一種荒唐的邪說！</p>
<p>以言　管制日本所採取的政策，過份寬大的地方，固所不免，　通說美國的遠東政策，若謂美國意欲利用日本反蘇，因而可以讓日本侵略軍閥的抬頭，則此種見解非誣即妄。美國朝野對於珍珠港事件的血的敎訓，刻骨銘心，當永遠不忘。而且美國人民一致認爲，戰後遠東問題的重點，就在如何管制日本使其侵略勢力不能再起。在日本民間，容或有媚美反蘇的論調，以希冀一旦有機會可以翻身，但我們須知這是日本挑撥美蘇感情的一種策略，美國亦必知之甚諗，而且英日同盟的敎訓，使美國朝野對於日本，早有透過一層的認識；美國人縱健忘，亦何至令日本人「沐猴而冠，」重來一蹂躪我東北的領土！</p>
<p>要之，這些悲觀的政論家，所以作此危言聲聽的怪論者，無非欲使一般讀者，在無意之中，接受其所謂「反共即爲美國之奴隸」的單純邏輯，爲共匪分割東北國土作一掩護的盾牌罷了。殊不知我們　欲阻止日本侵略勢力之套頭，在外交上可以使用我們的否決權；而在國內則更須無强肅淸共匪的軍事力量。惟有中國　淸了共匪，東北不入於蘇聯之掌握，遠東方可安定，世界方有和平。</p>

<h3>亞蒙在記者會上稱　英國正賴自力復興　經濟復元不完全仰望美國貸款</h3>
<p>英訪華團昨晨舉行之記者招待會巾重要問答如下：</p>
<p>英國輿論對香港問題意見如何？亞蒙助爵答謂，並未提起。</p>
<p>英國復興之展望如何？亞蒙勛爵答謂英國之復典，將依賴本國之苦幹，而不一定仰望美國貸款。議員哈里遜稱，英國經濟復元之困難，不一定爲缺乏美元頭寸，而爲英國貨物缺乏顧客；因其他國家戰後復興之遲緩，致影響英國復元之進展，中國亦爲此等國家之一。</p>
<p>對中英經濟合作有何建議？議員羅柏慈答謂，英國需要中國之大豆，糧食，鷄蛋等物，而中國亦需英國之生產機器，日前英國有剩餘產品出口，而中國不能，故英國如欲與中國大規模通商，必需先　對華信用貸款，此爲困難所在。惟中英經濟合作之展望則甚爲良好，</p>
<p>對於中國拒絕開放內河航行，有何意見？亞蒙勛爵答謂，中國之拒絕，可表示中國尚不準備與英國討論此類問題。英國之進口，允許全球各國之船隻駛入，凡英國本身不能允許他人者，亦決不以之向他國要求。中國輪聯會主席杜月笙之意見，爲一有價値之建議。</p>
<p>君等於對日和約有何高見？亞蒙爵士答謂，英國希望和約能早日成立，使世界恢復常態，但必須同時措施審愼，以免貽　將來；對日對德，均應如此。</p>
<p>君等對歐洲共產國際之成立，有何見解？議員麥克尼維答謂：「我人對此事不願有所評論，惟英人深信社會主義之民主政治，爲獲得繁榮與永久和平之唯一途徑。任何國家不予人民以自出而建立獨裁政治者，均爲違反舉世人民之最大利益。」</p>
<p>英國社會改革已有顯著成績</p>
<p>至是，英新聞處長建議訪問團一述工黨施政情形，亦由麥克尼維扼要陳述，謂工黨執政後，致力於廣泛之社會改革，舉其要者有：</p>
<p>家庭津貼制一目前英國家庭有小孩四人而達入學年齡者，每週可得政府十五先令之津貼。此對家庭爲莫大之協助，對政府則爲極大之負担。</p>
<p>社會保險制度——予疾病，失業，老年者以保障，對工人之福利關係甚大，獲得極大之擁護。</p>

<p>〔合衆社紐約廿二日電〕馬歇爾今日在紐約先驅論　報討論會中稱：美國復興歐洲之行動，已箭在弦上。社魯門總統亦致兩該會發起人萊特夫人稱，美國所採取之決定，將激烈影響美國與整個世界之關係。杜魯門之函內稱：我人必須極度謹愼，使我人所採取之各項步驟，眞正能達到我人意志中之目的。我人必須正視美國不能單獨復興歐洲之事實，我人之效力僅在輔助歐洲本身之自助。我人尤須確切把握，我人之所作所爲，不致違害我人自身經濟生活。在歐洲人民未能以其全力　諸世界之穩定前，決不能有一穩定之世界，而美國亦即無完全和平與安全之可言。</p>
<p>馬歇爾之演說中批評到處時時提及「馬歇爾計劃」之不當，渠稱事實上曾有「建議」而並無「計劃」。目前我人正在草擬一項計劃，作爲建議，向美國會提出。研究與準備階段已近結束，採取行動之時期即在眼前矣。渠稱：目前國務院官員大多每星期工作七天，與政府其他部會合作，準備援助建議。故在其完成時，將眞正成爲美國政府之計劃，而非任何一部會或某一機構之計劃也。</p>

<p>第二爲組織賡續援助機構之問題，弗朗克斯與其同僚今日曾就此事舉行討論，於此復發生三項問題：即　美國在此一歐洲所設以監督整個計劃之機構中，將有如何之發言權；　此一機構與美國所將設立以管理美國方面執行馬歇爾計劃之機構，應有何種關係；　此一機構與歐洲現存機構如歐洲經濟合作委員會及世界糧食委員會等，將採何種合作方式。第三爲美國所能供給美元之數額，歐洲代表及美國官員正在擬具公式，使巴黎會議提出之數字，不致减爲等於救濟性之援助。</p>

<p>〔聯合社巴黎廿三日電〕戴高樂之發言人今日宣稱：法國民族解放領袖將利用市選舉勝利結果，要求改選國會，以便取得政權。戴氏在市議會選舉之前，即已得近半數國會議員之擁護，如能獲國會議員三分之二擁護，即司表決自動解散，舉行普選。如僅獲多數，則可表決將國會解散，改選問題交由人民複決。</p>

<h3>伊朗國會通過法案　拒絕伊蘇石油協定　建議政府與蘇聯重開談判</h3>

<p>蘇丹納强調與蘇保持友誼，爲伊朗本身利益所在，於此渠特別提出蘇聯之曾不顧英美蘇三國條約，拒絕於一九四六年三月自伊朗撤退軍隊。並日蘇聯當時曾暗示欲以油權讓與交換蘇軍之撤退，其後始變爲要求共同開發油田。當時渠曾拒絕蘇聯之要求，其後蘇聯壓力愈見增强，渠遂不得不接受合組蘇伊油公司之建議，惟聲明須經國會批准後始有效。</p>

<h3>絲織糾紛僵持　拒絕上工？惡意罷工？　工人推代表提出三要求　資方表示準備晋京表願</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕本市絲織業勞資糾紛仍在僵持中，滬東區所有各絲織廠昨日仍陷於停頓狀態。工人代表陶雲山·魯倫炎·何恒富三人，於上午十時赴勞資評斷委員會，提出勞方要求三點：　一部份工廠因資方拒絕工人上工而陷於停頓者，工人工資應照給。　各廠應即日依勞資評斷曾規定，結算五月來各月工資，如資方延不結淸，工人所受損失應由資方賠償。　第十四次勞資評斷會關於絲織業勞資糾紛之評斷第二條：「如資方不勝負担時，雙方得自行另訂辦法，」徒給資方藉口，造成爭端，請予取銷。並對「施行四個月」之限期，亦請改爲無定期。同時絲織業公會否認有資方拒絕工人上工之說，且指工人係惡意罷工，並謂：勞資評斷委員會之一再變更評斷辦法甚不合理，公會已分別通知市商會與工業協會，將推派代表晋京請願。</p>
<p>據社會局吳開先局長表示，勞資評斷委員會評斷辦法不容更改，在總動員令下關閉工廠絕對不許，罷工亦爲嚴禁，如資方確係拒絕工人上工，則理屈在資方，工資自應照給。吳局長並分析絲織廠商願意關廠之原因稱：目前人造絲黑市價格較中信局配價高出三倍，各廠將配到之人造絲加工後之利潤，反不如將人造絲售諸黑市優厚。社會局現決心消滅人造絲黑市，因中信局握有百份之百之人造絲，如配售合理，則不應有黑市現象，故社會局已請中信局於本週內將配售名單送局重行審核，組織人造絲配售委員會，作公開合理化科學化之配售，則人造絲黑市不難消滅云。</p>
<h3>市府舉行經濟會報　決增設汽油組　建議管制棉價</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕第十三次經濟檢査會報，於昨日上午十一時在市府會議室舉行。決議如下：　關於檢査囤積暨業外商人之非法經營及逾限未登記之紗布事宜，由紗布組切實執行。　增設汽油組，由汽油分配委員會召集公用局會商辦理。</p>
<p>吳市長在會報席上，對主席面諭應嚴厲取締囤積居奇事，作一報告，囑各組加强監察工作。又因最近棉花價格，受銀行及公營私營紡織廠競購影響，被不合理抬高，紗布價格亦因之跟漲，影嚮民生甚鉅，會中擬定原則，建議行政院希能以有效辦法予以制止。據市府秘書長沈宗濂告記者：本市自實施紗布限期登記逾限沒收之緊急辦法後，調査結果，情形甚爲良好，存棉數量足供四五月之用，紗布存量亦頗充份，紗約六萬包，布有一百餘萬疋。</p>
<h3>公用局長談　汽過過戶問題</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕公用局長趙曾珏，昨與記者談本市汽車節約及過戶問題稱：目前停止汽車過戶之辦法，係暫時性質，並非凍結汽車。依照中央辦法規定，私人有資格使用汽車者，祗醫師，本市實施時擬加補充，將私人有資格使用汽車之標準予以放寬。該一辦法待擬就呈中央決定後，汽車即准過戶於准予使用汽車者。爲防止有借名藉勢過戶等情形發生，將來由輸入管理委員會，市參議會，市政府等機關共同組織一審査委員會，予以嚴格審査，經通過後方准過戶。關於現在已經進口或已領得進口許可證之汽車出路問題，經與吳市長商定，凡已登記之汽車進口商，其領得輸入許可證之汽軍，可售予政府准予使用汽車者，或以新車與原有執照者之　車作交換賣買。對私人自國外携車返國者，亦擬規定一日期，通知各船公司，在規定日期前起運者，准予進口。在規定日期後起運者，則須經審核後再定。至外埠來滬之車輛，已領加油證者，到期後不再續發。除非申請上海市之執照，正式在上海登記。</p>
<p>又據趙局長稱：十月十四日停止私人汽車登記前，申請發給執照者，尚有一六七件。該批未了案件，亦將由審核委員會審核決定。</p>
<h3>分級配油·務使公允</h3>
<p>〔又訊〕市府沈秘書長昨稱：汽車分級配油辦法，因恐實行時不公平，故正在審愼硏究中，詳細辦法未定。油公司因無工廠用油之詳細統計，故現正向各廠調査用油量，以期將來分配時能得公允。此事由汽油分配會與公用局會商。</p>
<h3>汽車公會·緊急會議</h3>
<p>本市汽軍商業同業公會，昨日召開臨時緊急會議，爲當局凍結汽車過戶，停發新照，限制私人汽車一事，商討對策：決具呈市參議會，請求轉請市府：　對汽軍過戶，應予解凍。　暫緩停止汽軍賣買，並暫緩停發執照。　請辦理各汽車行新舊存車總登記，限期出售，俾便收回資金。據該會負責人稱，　汽車不准賣買停發新執照後，各公司新舊汽車，勢必擱淺，鉅額資金，將遭凍結。　會員行家，業奉輸管會核准發給汽車輸入許可證，並已向國外訂購者，尚未到滬之軍輛頗多，如進口後不能賣出，及領得執照，則損失殊鉅，徒耗外匯。　爲擁護國策，實施節約辦法，對政府法令，自常遵守，但於商民生計利益，希望政府顧到。</p>

<p>〔本報訊〕台灣糖業公司爲推動台糖輸日計劃，曾與麥帥總部洽運中砂白糖二萬五千噸至日，開價爲每噸美金二七五元，概以現款交易。茲聞麥師總部，希望按照紐約市價每磅美金五分計算，每噸僅合美金百餘元，故洽談一時未能接近。刻該公司正候電中，一俟獲有治定，即將計劃二批台糖輸日辦法云。</p>
<h3>國煉火汕危險性　由於零售商攙雜　廠商向社局陳述理由</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕油脂業國煉火油廠，前由物價評議會決議，取締各廠從柴油中提煉火油，昨日國煉火油廠商推派代表至社會局向物價管理科說明國煉火油之成份，據謂：柴油之密度爲三十六度，舶來品火油爲四十五度，汽油爲六十度，國煉火油從柴油中提煉而來，密度較舶來品火油爲小，約在四十度左右問，燃燒度亦較舶來品爲低。但零售商往往以舶來品火油與汽油各半混合油攙雜國煉火油中冒充舶來品火油發售，該項混合油密度甚大，燃燒點高，因此危險性亦大。然攙雜者乃零售商所爲，國煉火油廠不能負責，故社會局爲防止此項危險性油類發售應取締零售商攙雜。而今取締煉油廠，不啻因噎廢食，徒增失業工人，而摧毀我國煉油工業基礎。社局物價管理科爲煉油商之解釋不無理由，將簽呈局長，對取締之議允予考慮。</p>
<h3>市長今明離滬　赴平休養</h3>

<h3>聯合電廠合約　公斷無損主權　减低成本優點甚多　直接間接均受期益</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕市參議會前因聯合發電廠合約第十三條規定如有糾紛時，請由國際法庭庭畏指定一公斷人公斷，認爲有損主權，加以反對。公用局長趙曾珏昨告記者稱：渠爲此會往訪王寵惠博士請予硏究合約內容。王博士認爲國際法庭係由各國司法界代表組織而成，公斷爲司法裁判上之進步辦法，並無喪權之處。</p>
<p>趙局長復稱：聯合電廠之目的係在使上海之電力减低成本，其優點甚多，譬如六家電廠本擬各自購置一萬瓩之發電機一座，因聯合廠之設立，祗需單獨購置六萬瓩一座即可，在單價方面可便宜多多，而六座發電機本需六組人員管理，現祗需技術較高之一組管理即可。又各廠原需各置預備機一座，共需六座，現祗需一座。聯合電廠擬分發電，輸電，配電，用電四部，由聯合電廠發電及輸電予各公司，再由各公司分配予用戶。聯合電廠之成立需恃金錢，人才與材料，擬購十萬瓩之發電機一座，需美金一千二百萬元，運華後之維持費及一切開支，亦需美金一千萬元，故炎金共需約二千萬美金。但若中外合作之後，外國投資之資本，可在國外直接購發電機運華，中國方面之資本，則作為維持費及開支之用。該一聯合電廠準備在五年內籌備完成，每日發電十萬瓩（現六公司已能發電十七萬瓩左右），以後視需要情形增加至五十萬瓩。將來如能成功，每月可增加生產品及間接得益相當於二千萬美金之財富。而所需負擔，則每年祗數十萬美金，故即在經濟立塲上言，亦甚為合算。</p>

<h3>社局召集四工會代表　再商討編製指數問題</h3>

<h3>「南路」的騷擾</h3>
<p>（本報廣州廿日航訊）記者最近訪問了來德的化縣縣長任　　，在他的談話裏，使我們知道了一些關於共匪在粵南一帶活動的真相。</p>
<p>粵南（粵人稱爲南路），那裏包括湛江市，化縣，　溪，茂名，信宜，廉江，以及雷州半島一帶，這些縣份與桂境毘　，與桂境的陸川北流，有水陸兩路可通。目前奸匪活動流竄地區，就是在這幾個縣份。湛江市固然是他們覬親的最大目標，但那裏因爲警衛力量較强，所以化縣便成了首當其衝的縣份，因爲化縣如果被控制，那就廉江，茂信，信宜等縣，便同時會受到威脅。</p>
<p>張焱舊部</p>
<p>那裏的共匪，主要的可分爲兩股，這就是他們所認爲「正規部隊」的「人民解放軍」。一股是由張炎的妻子鄭坤廉和莊田領導，這裏面的份子，大部份是張炎舊部的政工隊學生軍等，也有一些小學敎員和高中學生，所以算是他們優秀的「幹部」。但人數不多，作戰的主力，還是靠匪首符春茂部。符是戰時一個僞軍的團長，勝利後，他便帶了這團人投到匪軍方面去，這完全是漢奸的餘孽，人數大約有二千左右。</p>
<p>李英匪部</p>
<p>另外一股便是所謂「人民解放軍第四團」的李英部大約也有一千二百餘人。他們這些所謂「正規軍」，完全有軍服，有番號，配備有步槍，輕重機槍，手榴彈，小鋼砲，馬匹等，這些東西大部份是敵僞軍遺下，小部份是民間搶刦得來。此外，還有一些不屬於他們「正規」的零星散匪，多數是一二百人一股，份子的來源是當地的歹徒，無業游民，和一些無田可耕，爲生活所迫的農民，他們實在是土匪，並沒有政治性的。</p>
<p>流竄方式</p>
<p>這兩股匪軍，經常在粵南的各縣流竄着。有時在湛江附近，有時忽又開到茂名，看到有政府軍隊衆多的地方，他又避開，知道警衛不够的地方他又來騷擾一會。所以有時這裏發現匪軍數百，而那裏又發現匪軍千餘，便以爲到處都是，其實，不過是他們來來去去的騷擾吧了。</p>
<p>駐足無定</p>
<p>他們沒有固定的駐足點，自然更沒有所謂根據地，他們自詡爲有機動性，無後顧憂。而且，擅於夜襲，能够吃苦。但他們彈藥槍械缺乏，糧食補給困難，而且匪軍多數沒有受過訓練，缺乏軍事常識與作戰經驗，戰力甚爲薄弱，戰意亦甚低落。他們四處流竄的目的，是以較大的力量來刦掠民間的自衛槍械，破壞政府的基層組織，盡量在各地收買歹徒成立偽組織，派出什麼專員，縣長，鄕長，村主任等，並組織僞婦女會，農會，建立所謂「地下基層組織」。在他們控制之下的地方，便以最殘暴的手段，來敲詐勒索，强迫徵糧，强拉壯丁</p>
<p>謠言攻勢</p>
<p>匪軍的宣傳，倒是挺誇張的，他利用謠言攻勢，今天說要攻某縣城，明天又說要攻某大鎭，但南路各縣的城防，都是建築得極穩固的，普通都築有大碉堡，匪軍根本不易越雷池半步。譬如化縣城，他也曾揚言攻城四十多次，但從來沒有一次能够迫近三十華里以內的。而目前在那裹警衛地方的武力，除了保警處的三個總隊外，便全靠地方團隊與人民自衛組織來負責，所以祗能做到防衛工作，還未能够將匪軍主力打散。</p>
<p>增強軍力</p>
<p>照化縣任縣長的觀察，他說假如我們能够增加一些兵力，和地方團隊配合起來，要將南路的共匪完全殲滅，實在並非難事。不過他又指出：南路的匪風日熾，是與土地，民生兩大問題沒有解決，有莫大關係。因爲社會不安，勞動力過剩，致給予共匪許多機會，所以他認爲要解決了這兩個問題，才是澈底的辦法。</p>
<p>剿撫兼施</p>
<p>最近，自宋主席到粵後，已決定了首先解決治安問題，成立了粵南剿匪總指揮部，由保警處長陳沛兼任總指揮官，同時開拔了五個團以上的兵力到南路去，實行剿撫兼施，一面優容共匪自新來歸，一面用雷霆萬鈞的壓力實施掃蕩，相信不久的將來，南路共匪實力之謎，便可揭曉了。(特派員梁風)</p>

<h3>甘省全運繽紛錄　萬米發生糾紛　竟取雙料冠軍　王佩英當選「體育皇后」</h3>
<p>〔本市蘭州航訊〕甘肅省第一屆全省運動大會的開會盛况，記渚在上一次報導裏，已略述梗概。大會後三天，（十三日至十五日）表現得更如火如荼，有三十七項田徑賽，不但打破了甘省過去的最高紀錄，而且在最末一天（十五日）的萬米徑賽，更造成接近全國紀錄的輝煌成果。其餘如新聞記者班門弄　，百米徑賽，「體育皇后」的選舉　加冕，自行車的花樣表演，永登軍牧塲的馬術表演，都是極爲精彩的節目。</p>
<p>大會進行期間，會引起很多不快事件，大都是外縣各區選手　評判員不公，以及蘭州市的啦啦隊鬧得太兇，使他（她）們本來就無戰勝蘭州市的把握，却因此更恐慌得毫無表現了。在抗戰幾回之後，都經人調停了事，後兩夭更不准啦啦隊開口，大會算是「圓滿」結束。</p>
<p>體育皇后</p>
<p>這次風頭出得最足的，並不是造成接近全國萬米紀錄的王思信（蘭州市），也不是造成接近全國二百米女初組接力賽的女隊員（成績廿九秒），而是「體育皇后」選舉和加冕，這次選舉是由和平日報蘭州社於大會第五日（十四日）發起，到次日中午揭曉，顯然是生意眼重於羣衆興趣，因爲選舉票印在報紙的對面上，凡投票的人都得購一張當日的報紙，結果第九區臨洮女師高材生王佩英，以四千五百一十二票當選爲本屆「體育皇后」，九區臨洮女師李惜春以二千八百六十三票當選「亞后」。大會對這項活動，並無表示。直到閉幕之後，攝影記者才在人海裏覓到這位矮個子，皮膚　黑的「皇后」，這時和平日報當局才把紅綠紙糊成的王冠赶拿了來，替她戴上，便有許多開末拉對準了她。次日上午，和平日報還爲慶賀她們而舉行過一次茶會，並由社長易君左賦詩贈「體育皇后」，精裱了獻給她。有人批評說這種作風近乎「海派」，其實王小姐本人只有有十八歲，一個道地鄕下孩子，雖然讀到高二了，但並無一點「交際花」的氣息，她不過被別人當作廣告，利用一番而已。</p>
<p>萬米糾紛</p>
<p>關於萬米決賽的情形，除了名正言順的五思信是第一之外，還有一個第一名，是二區的羅映戰。這是一塲科紛的結果：先是，萬米決賽的前幾圈，羅顯得毅力過人，大有冠軍希望，其次最有實力的，才是王思信，參加競賽的廿人中，蘭州市約占三分之一，除了王之外有很多落後好幾圈的蘭市選手，爲本市爭取冠軍的榮譽，落後的三人把羅包圍起來，　幾次突圍，均告失敗，最後Dash時，王思信以三十六分五十七秒又十分之四奪得冠軍，羅第二個赶到，相差無幾，待發獎品時，第二區以他們的選手羅映黻之第二名，是迫於包圍，評判員竟不加　涉，顯然有點徧袓，他們拒絕領獎，最後大家調停一番，取了兩個第一，究竟將來誰能代表甘肅參加明年五五的全運，現在還無下文。</p>

<h3>當局考慮改進配給制度　調節物資平抑物價　計口配售食油不久即可實現</h3>
<p>〔本報訊〕據悉：本市關係當局刻正對各項物資之配給制度，考慮改進辦法。聞原則上對影響較大，供應未入正軌之物資，先把握資源，然後將儘可能採取戶口配售制。至供應較正常之物資，則將先就最受影響部份之市民，先予配售，並視實際武情，增减配售量。</p>
<p>目前按戶配售之物資，僅食糖一種。茲經該關係當局研究結果，認爲食油亦有仿照食糖計口配售之價値。配售辦法，正積極擬具中。聞原則將以每口每月配售食油一斤爲準。以全市四百萬人口計算，每月需供油四萬擔。該項食汕，將以菜油爲主。配價大致將遵照食汕議價辦迎。該項計劃，預計十一月間可實行。</p>
<p>食米麵粉兩項，最近市價不無波動，惟到源極見充沛，尤以麵粉一項，本市尚有剩餘，以備運往外埠交換其他必要之物資。食米一項，除已對公敎人員（約十六萬人)，產業工人（約二十七萬人)，及專案辦理之貧戶數十萬人，直接配售外，刻復增配職業工人約十五萬人，一方面復擴充貧戶配額至九十八萬人，本市最感受高米價咸脅之市民，可謂已儘量配到。其他市民，因米市到源充沛，已可自由取給於市云。</p>
<h3>憑定單敘做押匯　棉商業請予取消　張總裁對所陳理由允予考慮</h3>
<p>關於棉商要求取消憑紗廠定單，始准敍做押匯問題，昨（廿三日)晨國行張總裁特約唔本市棉花商業同業公會代表劉屛孫，鄭哲丞兩氏，當由代表　陳要求取消憑紗廠定單始准叙做押匯之理由，並稱，如棉商叙做押匯，必須提供定單，即無異棉花商人不能叙做押匯，而其他民生日用必需品押匯辦法，並無此項限制。</p>
<p>上海存棉僅五萬八千餘担，祗敷紗廠五天之用，在戰前上海存棉恒達一百萬担以上，現値國棉登塲之際，政府正應督導棉商努力搜購，不應另加限制，自阻來源，造成物資缺乏物價狂漲現象。　棉商須憑紗廠定單始做押匯，事實困雖旣如上述，而理論爲防止囤積，亦不號然。夫囤積無罪，囤積而居奇不售乃應取，在今日棉花不能自給之情形下，正應疏導棉源，增加存量，乃能適應供需，平抑棉價，至所謂棉商不應祗顧私人利益，期求低利貸款，而增加他人負担一節。其實棉商祗希望融通資金，並不期求低利，設因資金不獲週轉而棉源阻塞，棉價高漲，則自必增加多數人負担也。</p>
<p>張總裁對上開各節，深爲重視，並詢來棉之存放處所，是否可集中銀行倉庫，以期易於控制，達到商民與政府相互合作之境地。代表等表示極願接受，凡承做押匯之棉花自可限定堆存銀行倉庫，但望政府多予通融資金之便利，從而開展業務，以期增加棉源，聞張總裁對此允予考慮，在短期內解決此一問題云。</p>

<h3>浮多斬售已盡華股趨勢轉穩</h3>
<p>華股昨逢現遞掉期之日，多方泰半預事了結，以致中途仍見不景。迨浮多斬售已盡，得銀根轉鬆之助，業中買戶重來活動，始漸轉穩。後市更爲堅定，惟過程則仍形飄忽，高後易回。晨初略穩，永紗開價升爲二八五元及二九五元。惟塲外交貨仍艱，息價仍開二角七及三角一分牛，十時牛後，再低至即交二七六元，，遞交二八七元低價。殘餘浮多至此已告肅淸，銀根普遍鬆動。午收升至二八六元及二九五元。冷股若商務水泥仍在低價，榮豐景綸火柴未蒙帶上，餘股均稍見定。結果較前收即交股計麗安中興平平，商務水泥跌一成，火柴景綸榮豐降半成，永紗信和中紡勤興華新微升，餘均小挫。遞交股計美亞華豐景福各跌半成，永紗信和勤興微挫。後市買淸　盛，永紗躍升至二九四元及三〇四元。最高會到即交二九八元，遞交三〇八元高價。塲外喊價忽低，一度回及三〇三元結束。華新信和美亞亦被拉高，結果較晨收即交股計華新美亞中絲中紡勤興內衣升半成光景，永紗信和華豐商務火柴景綸新光中法新華榮豐統益閘北麗安微升，景福　豐尚平，信誼微降。　交股計新光華豐動興尚平，永紗信和美亞景福微升。塲外各老股升降互見。</p>

<h3>回憶受全部麻醉的一天</h3>
<p>— 王爵榮</p>
<p>「小弟弟，不要怕，安靜地睡着，待一會兒施用麻醉劑的時候你就慢慢的深呼吸，這樣不久你就會失去感覺，不知痛苦了！」一位年靑的醫生，操着純粹的國語，對着一個躺在手術桌上靜候開刀的病人很和藹地這樣說着！</p>
<p>這一個病人呢，年紀不過十六七歲，穿上了一套潔白的病衣，　觫的躺在手術桌上，好像一頭被縛在祭台上的綿羊，在候着祭師們的宰割。</p>
<p>手術室裏除了主任醫師外，誰也不敢隨意談話，那可憐的病者，感到了像死一樣的沉寂，除了醫師們洗手的水聲，他簡直可以聽到自己的心臟在跳動！</p>
<p>灰色的窗帘，柔和的光錢，閃閃發光的手術器械，戴着大白帽子的姆姆，一切的莊嚴肅靜，整潔，爲這小病人都成了恐怖！那時候他的內心感覺到無限的悲哀，他想着了母親，他想着了家，他痛悔自己不該來開刀，可是太遲了，他的鼻子上被罩着一個白色的罩子，同時一陣特別的Chloroform氣味直鑽進他的鼻管，不，也鑽進了他的心頭！</p>
<p>這時候，他忘了家，忘了母親，他祗想暫時停止呼吸，使這吸不慣的氣味，不再鑽進他的鼻管，眞的，他眞忘了這氣味會使他减少痛苦！</p>
<p>可是，事不由人，他愈是不想呼吸，他的呼吸愈是急促，在這時候，他淸晰的聽見主任醫師談話的聲音，他想告訴他們，他還沒有睡　，請他們暫緩動手，可是他的嘴已經不肯聽他的指揮，他想舉手示意，可是他一動也動不了，這時候他才完全了解，俗語所調一口不應心」和「心有餘而力不足」的眞義，不多一會，談話的聲音來越響了。好像談話的人已經走近耳邊，再一會兒，這聲音大得像嚮雷，一個字一個字的震動了他的耳鼓，最後聲音是這樣的饗，他終於不能辨出每一個字的意義，而祇覺得自己好像乘着飛機在雲霧裏走！頭腦的暈眩，結果使他完全失了感覺，而在電短短的時間裏，嫻練的醫師們已經順利的完成了他們的任務。</p>
<p>在手術快完成的當兒，助手們早機警地停止了麻劑，可憐的小病人，重新獲得了自由空氣，蒼白的臉色，也漸漸轉成紅潤；「自由的空氣對於人們是多麼地需耍呀！」一個助手這樣感慨的想着。</p>
<p>病人自己呢，好像從另一世界飛回地球；聲音又像入睡前一樣地在耳邊饗着，人們談話的聲音，也從糢糊而至隱約，由　約而至淸晰，等到完全淸醒的當兒，談話的人，也好像從耳邊慢慢的遠去，結果聲音的高低完全入於正常，手脚也漸漸可以活動，說話當然也恢復了自由；他用力睜開他的雙眼，想看看短別以後的世界，眞的，這短短幾分鐘的昏睡，在他好像已經幾個世紀了！最使他奇怪的是大地的景物，一切雖然依舊，可是都變成了像天空一樣的蔚藍，這使他疑心他被戴上了一副有色的眼鏡！</p>
<p>「快閉上眼睛吧！」一個女性柔和的聲音，開始在他的耳邊震盪：「纔上過麻藥的人應該安睡，這時睜開眼請，是會損傷目力的！」這一席話，打斷了小病人的思想，他知道這是麻醉後應有的現象，可是很快地他感覺到他的頭下沒有枕頭使他不適，他要求一個柔軟的枕頭；同時從昨晚到現在，十幾個小時沒有進食物，使他覺得飢腸轆轆，他又要求一些食物；所有的要求，都受到了拒絕，理由是防止嘔吐！</p>
<p>天呀！沒有枕頭猶可以熬，不吃東西眞難受！「等出院以後，我一定要大吃一頓！」他這時祗有用這阿Q方式安慰自己。</p>
<p>到底受過麻醉的人是疲乏的，他很快地進入黑甜鄉，一睡就好幾個鐘頭，醒來時，已是黃昏時刻病房裏點上了一盞凄慘的黃燈，兩旁空牀上的被褥疊得高高得，像是有人藏在裏面，遠遠的傳來了一陣呻吟聲，使人聽了不寒而慄！</p>
<p>窗外的大樹，不時在習習作響！可憐這第一次離家的小病人，好像被隔離在荒郊，他想起了旁邊的空牀上，也許會死過人，他又想起自己睡着的牀，也許昨晚正有人在上面死去！這時天色更黑了，窗外除了一團一團的樹影，什麼也看不淸楚！一陣凉風吹來，呻吟的聲音，格外的淸晰，好像正在他的左側；好像看見有人影在窗外搖動，他又好像看見對面空牀上的白被單裏有東西在蠕動，他蒙上了被，他反覆的唸着「捷克斯拉發克」可是越唸越淸醒了，越淸醒越是覺得駭怕，終於他那被開刀的地方一陣陣地痛了起來！</p>
<p>失眠是痛苦的事，疼痛更使人受不了，再加上駭怕，悲哀，和煩燥，這一夜，這僅僅的一夜，爲這位小弟弟，眞可以說是他過去個人史上最慘痛的一頁！</p>
<p>疼痛增加煩燥，煩燥便人失眠，失眠令人焦急，焦急更增加了疼痛，結果這孩子由呻吟而飲泣由飲泣而狂呌！他需要人作伴，他更需要慈母一般的撫繳；他要呌人，他忘了可以掀鈴，這時他祗知咀咒，她咀咒着　護，他咀咒着醫生，他更咀咒使他痛苦的病患！</p>
<p>他的喊呌聲驚動了夜班的看護長，一位和善的老姆姆，他安慰着這小病人，她撫摩着他，她關心地問他疼痛情形是不是眞的這樣厲害，她給他一些藥粉和幾匙開水，她告訴他這是最靈的止痛安眠劑，　後她憐憫的的坐在小病人的身傍，像慈母一般的撫拍着這大大的嬰兄，她那慈祥地態度，關心的撫　給與這小病人非常大的安慰！他不再狂呌了，不再駭怕了，中心的悲哀，也去了一大半，他覺得世界上到底還有人關心他！很快的，瘡口處的疼痛，漸漸地止了，上下眼皮也漸漸的相近，終於他安靜地睡着了</p>
<p>看護長笑味味地包起了剩餘的藥粉——根本不止痛的藥粉，高興地看了病人一眼順着呻吟的方向，走到另一問病室去開始她新的撫慰工作！</p>
<p>天呀！誰說同情和安慰，不是世界上最靈的止痛藥呢！</p>
<p>現在這十三年前的小病人，已成了畢業七年的醫師，想起了當年做病人時的痛苦，所以寫出了這篇回憶，來自勉幷勉勵他的同道，他的結論是：</p>
<p>「在你醫治病人的時候，請你想一想你自己生病時候的痛苦！」</p>
<h3>梅毒和騐血</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>吾人在臨症上，常常遇到運樣的病人，「先生！你替吾驗驗血嗎？」。「啊！要驗什麽呢！你要知道是否貧血，應當計算赤血球和血色數；你要知道是否瘧疾和回歸熱，應當檢査瘧疾原虫和回歸熱螺旋體；你要知道是否傷寒，應當做維大爾氏反應；你要知道糖尿病的程度，應當檢査血糖量；要把你的病症，經過醫師的決定，應當檢査什麼，再去報告化驗所，方才可以着手進行，否則茫無顯緒，要化驗的人，替你檢査，眞是一部廿四史，從何說起呢！」吾勞勞叨叨的說了一大篇，他方才把檢査的目的告訴我「先生！吾要知道吾血裏是否有毒？」那吾恍然他所希望的，是要做一次華氏反應。</p>
<p>華氏反應是檢査梅毒的一種標準方法，雖然繼華氏反應之後，有着種種的變法，牠還不失爲權威者。但是一般的人，對牠還沒有深切的認識，待吾寫幾條出來，告訴大家吧！</p>
<p>試驗的結果，如果有梅毒的話，呌做陽性反應，用十號來表示。再看程度的如何，有强陽性卅，陽性廿，弱陽性十的分別。如果沒有梅毒的話，呌做陰性反應，用一號來表示。</p>
<p>有陽性反應的時候，大體上可決定有梅毒。</p>
<p>有梅毒的病人，不一定個個都現陽性反應，在第一期梅毒，發現陽性的有二％；第二期梅毒在發疹的時候最多，有九五—100%；第三期梅毒有五〇-100%；早期潛伏梅毒有二八—八三％；所以華氏反應陰性的時候，也不能說他「一定不是梅毒」。</p>
<p>梅毒以外的疾病，譬如有癩病，高度肺結核，猩紅熱，瘧疾，回歸熱，癌腫，糖尿病等的時候，間亦有發生陽性的事情。</p>
<p>華氏反應的出現，大多在感傳後五六個星期方才逐漸顯著起來，換句話講，在五六星期以前，華氏反應不論你是否有毒，總　是陰性的。常常有一種病人，在不　性交以後，憂心耿耿，急地跑到醫醫那裏，請求騐血，如果醫師不明白他的情形，就去驗血，驗血的結果，雖呈陰性，病人就以爲吾是淸白的，其實你上了大當，把病毒蓋了一層烟幕彈，讓他潛伏滋長起來；一方面還以爲沒有毒，去和你的妻子交接，把病毒轉播開來，豈不是寃者枉也。</p>
<p>上面已經說過，陰性反應，不一定不是梅毒；陽性反應，也有發生在其他疾病的時候。並且化驗所的報告，有時有這樣的一個記號十一，這是表示可疑的意思，那末執權威的華氏反應，也是不可靠的。你要知道，偵査疾病，並不是僅僅靠一種方法，須要醫師經過各方面的偵査：譬如你從前感傳的經過情形，現在出現於身體上的種種病變，加以決定，華氏反應到是一種有力的旁證呢！</p>
<p>甲試試所報告呈陽性，乙試驗所報告呈陰性，這是什麽道理呢！原來華氏反應的操作，並不是簡單的事情，如果所用材料，應用的器具，有不週到的地方，就可以發生錯誤，兩方面報告不同的緣故，就是在此嗎！</p>
<p>如果有過梅毒的人，雖然經過治療，僅僅一次的華氏反應檢査，就是呈陰性的時候，也是不可靠的，需要多次反覆的檢査，因爲隔了幾何時以後，仍有呈陽性的。</p>
<p>有潛伏梅毒的人，驗血雖呈陰性，可以注射一次九一四，刺戟一下，有再呈賜性反應的。這呌做喚發性華氏反應。</p>
<h3>哺乳兒營養障礙（續）</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>人工營養兒之營養障礙　平衡矢調症</p>
<p>一，以人乳營養為嚴優，且對於其飲　，並無十分顧慮之必要。</p>
<p>二，半乳營養，平衡失調症之患兒，對於乳脂之瓣力著爲减退。對於炭水化物之耐力，尚不被侵，故以减少牛乳之脂肪量，添加炭化物為原則。</p>
<p>輕症時，减牛乳之量，用至二％之穀　汁，穀粉　汁，代水以稀釋半乳，其中添加滋養糖，滋養麥芽糖，麥芽汁　及Liebig氏汁（二至五％)。重症時，可用脫脂乳，或牛酪乳等類之脂肪較少之乳汁中加麥芽汁及Liebig氏汁。有時用普通市中出售之飴糖代麥芽汁　亦可。麥芽汁膏Liebig氏汁之添加量視大便之性質而增减，凡排泄硬便即所謂皂狀便者，增量之，旣成軟便則一减少之可也。</p>
<p>消耗症</p>
<p>即平衡失調症之增進者之謂，小兒成長上所必需之　量，當由體重而定，每體重一兛之必需燃價爲一一五至一三〇卡羅利。</p>
<p>最好用人乳。若哺乳力弱而迅速疲勞，不能吸啜充分之乳汁時，則搾取人乳用匙與之。又若因某一乳母(或母乳)而發育不充分時，則代以另一乳母即易成長也。</p>
<p>難以充分得人乳時，則施以混合營養法，於稀釋之牛乳即　乳，　乳，％乳中，加滋養糖，滋養麥芽糖，Liebig氏汁等。若欲僅行人工營養時，則於脫脂乳，半酪乳，或Liebig氏汁之脂肪較少者之中加多量之糖爲宜。凡續發於後述之外因的營養障礙而來之消耗症患兒，與營養療法相反應；但基因於內因的異常體質（滲出性成神經質）之消耗症，雖盡行最近之營養療法亦無效，即用母乳，亦不發育，反有衰弱者，如是之一次性消耗症，有用蛋白療法有效之報告例。用馬或人血淸，每隔日或四，五日注射於肌肉內，其量初爲一，〇立糎，漸次增量達五，〇卡維　司氏報告嘗試行於十九例之一次性消耗症，有十例全治云。凡得良好之效果者，體重曲綫，自血淸注射之二三百後，即見急上云。(未完)</p>

<h3>「踢破」考</h3>
<p>— 海勺</p>
<p>「踢破」一字，驟視之，不無費解之處。但在上海，市井間流行頗廣，茶寮酒肆，耳熟能詳。給而豐厚，授之者面現德色；受而菲薄，取之者心存怨恚。施一納，寫盡世故人情；或鬆或緊，繪出喜笑怒駡。此字就文論義，原無可取，依聲尋意，却有出典。眞是「踏破釘鞋無覓處，得來全不費工夫」也。</p>
<p>本文小題大做，多少有牛刀鷄之嫌。但昔人云：「姜老値西伯而投磻溪之綸，韓英遭漢高乃騁撥亂之才」，潛靈棲鴻，待時以動，否泰窮達，咸繫乎運。「踢破」仿自泰西，其初不彰，歐風東漸，始爲人所習用；雖云小道，要亦有關風俗隆汚，世運盛衰。識小見大，自古已然，風雲際會，於今爲烈，得時者昌，此之謂乎。</p>
<p>勝利以還，「考克推爾派對」——鷄尾酒會——盛極一時，好事之徒，一再考證。羊毛出在羊身上，洋人固能圓其說也「踢破」者源遠流長，又何忍令其湮沒無聞乎。偶覽西籍，見有」踢破」家世之作，爰爲迻述，以明原委。引經據典，概出他人之手，畫蛇添足，何敢掠人之美。謹本舉爾所知之情義，聊盡宣揚「德政」之至意。博君一粲，讀者固無須破費TIP也。</p>
<p>據云：TIP爲三個英字之濃縮體，故應於每一個字母之後，加上小點讀之。原文蓋爲To　lnsure　Promptness－意爲祖保(服務)迅速。縮而併之，乃成「踢破」之者。昔日英人習俗，旅館或咖啡館中，常於客人出入之處，懸二小箱，以納顧主之額外犒賞，而榜以TIP三字。猶之我寺院中之有「香金入櫃」，寓勸誘於督促之中，文字雖異，而用意則一也。</p>
<p>英文「踢破」用作給予之義解者，始於一六一〇年薩繆爾·羅萊士。其後一七〇六年喬治，法闊亞，一七三三年威廉姆·柏德等諸作家，又曾在劇本或文字中，以額外犒賞之意義，採用「踢破」。以年代論，其時適當前淸康熙年間，不知當時之上海人，口頭亦常用「踢破」否？</p>
<p>老牌牛津字典中，釋TIP之義云：「給予僕役小厮等的一些小費」；欲求其詳，則更進一層云：「由於服務或希望服務時，給予僕役車夫或他人之小厮，一些數目不定之額外賞金」。</p>
<p>綜上所述，我人對於「踢破」一字，當能得其正確之概說矣。限凡欲求迅速之服務者，「踢破」爲敲門之金磚，此第一定義也；希望獲得某種服務時，「踢破」必不可少，拋磚引玉，此第二定義也；「踢破」之數目不能規定，墻高磚厚，此第三定義也。舉一反三，明乎此，則於「踢破」運用之道，思過半矣！</p>
<p>海上繁華甲天下，事事開風氣之先，我人不妨擴大其定義，直截爽快曰：「踢破」者，客人隨意賞給侍役之小小賬也。用之得法，皆大歡喜；不得其道，兩敗俱傷，交際塲中，女朋友前，寗鬆母緊，寗豐母儉。因小失大，古有明訓；小不忍，亂大謀，更宜三復斯言，弗以字「簡」而忽之也可。</p>
<p>京津豫帮菜館中謙謹之侍役，當食客於加三或加三以外，再給以額外「踢破」者，必拉直嗓子，高呼「外賞　　元，謝…！」此一「謝」字音長氣旺，勁通之足，直可與四郎探母一劇中，楊延輝「呌小番」之番字相媲美！侍役站班，一路出大門，堆笑折腰，主客增光，此爲「踢破」作用之陽面。及至第二次作座上客，侍役印象旣深，應酬必更週到，賓至如歸，客來盡歡，一呼百諾，從心所欲，此又爲「踢破」之副作用。欲求後果，必種前因，識時務者，其誌之乎。</p>
<p>港粵菜館，於堂彩之外，食客爲見好於茶役起見，亦多付以「踢破」者，對於女性招特爲更。但在「付固不拒，受亦不謝」之硬繃繃作風下，外江偌往往引爲訝異。實則粵俗呼小小賬爲「手震」，夫如何而能令手發震，此則在乎食客之善自斟酌矣。接受者於眞能手「震」之於，而不悅服心「感」者，我不信也！</p>
<h3>醉桃源兩闋</h3>
<p>— 胡盧</p>
<p>本報成都訊，川西彭縣老光山中，發現「世外桃源」，居民多係戰時逃難入山，聚族而居，自力衣食，茫然不知今日時局與物價。爰塡此調！</p>

<p>人類語言的種類，是多得太驚人了。據語言學家統計，大概有兩三千種。</p>
<p>現代人類語言種類，太概可以分爲世界語，國語，和種族語三種。世界語言的使用是最廣泛的，其次是國語，再次是種族語。</p>
<p>代表世界語言的有英文，中文，法文，俄文，阿拉伯文，西班牙文，德文，荷蘭文，和葡萄牙文。用英文作爲國語的有英國人，美國人，愛爾蘭人，加拿大人，澳大利亞人，新西蘭人，南非人：此外在非洲，印度，大洋洲，埃及，中國，近東，也有人用英文說話。約有五萬四千萬人使用着英文，其中的一萬七千萬人，把英文當作國語。使用中文的超過五萬萬人，雖然中國各地有許多方言，但由於中國過去的文化優於鄰國的民族，漢字曾傳入日本，高麗和印度支那的一部份，因此也成了遠東的國際語言。使用法文的有一萬零七百萬人，他們分佈在西歐，北非，加拿大，英國和印度支那，其中把法文當做國語的有四千五百萬人。使用俄文有二萬五千萬人，內中包括把它常做國語的九千萬人；使用的範圍是斯拉夫各民族，芬蘭，羅馬尼亞，中國一部份，和伊朗等地。用阿拉伯文當國語說的有三千七百萬人，他們分佈在埃及，叙利亞，伊拉克等國。此外，阿拉伯文還是回敎國家裏的學術與宗敎的文字，這些回敎國家的總人口有二萬萬人，分佈在從西方的北非到印度北部和中國西部，從巴爾幹到馬來羣島的廣大地域上。用西班牙文說話的有八千萬人，其中把它當做國語的有六千五百萬人。從前說德文德有八千萬人，但由於法西斯帝的驚人罪行，德文已沒有從前那樣流行了。使用荷蘭文的六千萬人，其中把它作為國語的有歐洲，南非的布爾人和荷屬印度的一千二百五十萬人。說葡萄牙文的有四千五百萬人，其中有三千六百萬人把它當做國語。</p>
<h3>最愛到的地方</h3>
<p>— 沙洲</p>
<p>一個夏天的黃香，當大科學家愛迪生由他那間造福於全世界人類的硏究室工畢回家時，他的夫人迎着他，愛撫地說：「你太辛苦了，親愛的，你這樣矻矻不息地勞苦工作得太久了，這是很不利於你的身體的，我勸你還是快些找一個好地方休養休養吧」</p>
<p>「可是呌我到什麼地方去呢？」那個大發明家說。</p>
<p>「隨你的便，揀你最愛的地方去好了。」</p>
<p>「好吧，」愛迪生笑着，「我明天就動身」</p>

<h3>三班與縣太爺</h3>
<p>— 一峯</p>
<p>宋代的三理職務，是個頂起碼的小京官兒，月俸錢七百，驛劵肉半斤，簡直寒傖得可以。因有人爲詩自嘲，題於驛舍之上云：「三班奉職實堪悲，卑賤孤寒只自知；七百料錢何日富？半斤羊肉幾時肥？」不想下情居然上達，使朝廷亦謂一如此何以責廉偶？」竟將待遇加以調整。又石蔓卿學士最初亦會為此，緣石初登第，考運不隹，被人告訴說科場有弊覆試，因爲得而復失的數人，石亦是其中之一。改授至班借職。當符昭追回所賜勅　靴服時，這幾個落了第的，怎能不有眼見到嘴的肥肉又被奪取的悲哀，於是痛哭起來。獨石依然不以爲　，作詩一絕曰：「無才且作三班　，請俸爭如錄事參？從此罷稱卿　進，且須走馬東西南。」這位於死後來被歐陽修捧爲生而爲英，死而爲靈的石學士，畢竟是可人。</p>
<p>縣太爺雖然是七品小官，但在明淸兩代，還必需二榜正途出身，始可以撈得到手。何况直接親民卻正是縣長，刮地皮，撈油水，都比京官便當得多。祗是縣份貧富不同，和個人的操守有別，所以嘗甜頭固然不少；而歷來吃苦水者，也恐大有人在。如　　小品云；「郁動弱冠爲華蓉令，素戲虐，作詩日：「華容知縣是區區，三甲多因不讀書。縣丞主簿皆僚友，通判同知總上司。忙裏無心吞冷飯，閒中有口嚼乾魚。前世孽緣今世苦，華容知縣是區區。」雖係自嘲，未嘗不牢　滿紙。冷飯幹魚，未到雖淡，然較草根樹皮，總較强些吧。「吃得苦中苦，方為人上人」，姓　的之不善於做官也明矣。</p>

<h3>美國小姐</h3>
<p>— 徐菽園</p>
<p>美國小姐的勞軍運動</p>
<p>軍人在美國十足的成爲天之驕子，這倒並不是美國軍人夜郎自大，而的確是美國崇拜軍人，而美國軍人確有可以崇拜之處。第一，美國軍人的智識水準很高，小兵至少中學畢業，而大學畢業戴過方帽子穿過黑道袍掛有學碩博士頭銜的，也十居其三四；第二，美國採用徵兵制，小兵都是良家子弟，沒有傭兵，也咩有代役，美國的兵稱得起上「好勇」，他們穿上軍服，固照得英武，但決不致憑藉那一身老虎皮去嚇老百姓，因爲丘八在美國也是老百姓，不是特殊階級，而且美國兵是不准把武器帶出營房的，除値勤人員有公用手槍外，其餘無論官佐士兵一律不得佩帶，濫用武器是最易敗壞軍風紀，而且良莠不齊，眞僞莫辨。有了上面的二種原因，美國兵在社會上的地位，自然的崇高了，地位一高，便引出婦女界得愛慕。</p>
<p>美國女界有五光十色的勞軍組織，最具規模的有USO（united　sercice　organieation），紅十字會，女靑年會，婦女協會（Women＇sClub），還有什麼母親會，姊妹會也在做勞軍工作。USO是勞軍工作做得最起勁的一個，工作人員包括婦女領袖，家長，學生，電影明屋，演員，歌聖，組有許多流動劇團，在各軍營各戰塲義務表演USOShow，在全美各大小城市均設有分會，辦理軍人宿舍，食堂，跳舞會，圖書館，醫務所；還有貸款部，如果有軍人阮囊羞澀，可向該會貸款數十元，名爲貸款，實際是母需歸還的。</p>
<p>我記得在加列福尼亞省的聖泰安娜空軍基地軍醫院養病時，適値耶穌聖誕節，有USO及紅十字會工作婦女來病室慰問，問病人要什麼禮物，她們都可照辦，有許多黑兵指定要現款，於是工作婦女向市內婦女界募款，過了一會就携來大宗美鈔銀元　幣，約有數千元之譜，給十幾個黑兵公派。她們不時有歌咏團到軍醫院病房來演唱，你可以點戲，而且有一個長駐在醫院裹的工作婦女專門義務敎授流行歌曲，諸如「白相大嫂嫂」之類Poistol　Packing，Mamma。各該婦女勞軍團體完全慈善性質，工作人員義務效勞，甚至捐助大宗款項。這種賠本事業祗有美國女人眞做，她們的確能激勵士氣，鼓起作戰情緒，如果沒有美國小姐出動，什麼麥克阿瑟，什麼愛森　華都要洩氣的。</p>

<h3>Government Begins Price Controls; Yarn and Cloth Decided on Joint Allocation, to Be Implemented First in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The government has begun to implement price controls, with the first being the control of yarn and cloth. The joint allocation of yarn and cloth will be implemented. The National Economic Council made a comprehensive decision on this at its second meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd, and it will be implemented in the Shanghai area starting from the 24th. This control is mainly based on the previously passed development of the textile industry and regulation of yarn and cloth supply. The main points of the implementation plan are as follows: Regarding the price of yarn and cloth, a dynamic and reasonable negotiated price will be implemented according to the plan. Unified purchase of domestic cotton will be implemented according to the plan, and joint price negotiation will be carried out.</p>
<p>The full text of the outline for joint allocation of cotton yarn based on certificates is recorded as follows: The cotton yarn produced by state-owned and private yarn mills, except for the cotton yarn turned over to the government, and that used for military purposes, export, and actual self-weaving needs, should all be jointly allocated in accordance with the method of allocation based on certificates. The cotton yarn entrusted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Textile Adjustment Committee will also be included in the joint allocation. The finished product allocation subcommittee originally established by the Textile Adjustment Committee will be reorganized into the Cotton Yarn Joint Allocation Committee, which will be responsible for handling matters related to cotton yarn allocation based on certificates. For cotton yarn allocation based on certificates, the Joint Allocation Committee should refer to the amount of yarn in storage and pre-determine the total amount of allocation on a monthly basis. The detailed methods for joint allocation should be formulated by the Joint Allocation Committee in accordance with the provisions of Sections 1, 2, and 3 of Chapter 4 of the implementation plan of this council, and reported to the Textile Adjustment Committee for review and transmission to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record. This outline will be implemented first in the Shanghai area, and gradually promoted to all parts of the country, and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval, and the Textile Adjustment Committee will be instructed to implement it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In addition to approving the joint allocation of yarn and cloth, the National Economic Council also passed the following important proposals: The State-Owned Enterprise Management Law, which has a total of thirty-five articles, the main points of which are: State-owned enterprises should be managed in a business-like manner, striving to be profitable without loss, and at a minimum, should be self-sufficient. If there is a surplus at the end of the year, it should be turned over to the national treasury. If there is a loss, it should be reported to the competent authority for appropriation from the national treasury. Amendment of the organizational regulations of the State-Owned Enterprise Sales Supervision Committee. The main amendments are to Articles 3 to 5, which stipulate that the committee shall have one chairman and one vice-chairman, and eleven members, who shall be appointed by the National Economic Council. The vice-chairman may be a full-time position, and nine to eleven experts may be hired as consultants.</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation measures of the economic reform plan, the financial and economic parts are being drafted by Xu Kan. The remaining parts have been reviewed by Gu Yuxiu and others in seven meetings. On the 23rd, Chen Lifu convened a comprehensive review meeting, and it is expected to be submitted to the meeting next week.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhendong Analyzes Reasons for Price Increases at National Economic Council, Presents Concrete Opinions on Control Measures</h3>
<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] Liu Zhendong, a member of the National Economic Council who went to Shanghai to investigate prices, reported on the 23rd at the council's regular meeting on the price situation of gold notes, flowers, yarn, cloth, fuel, rice, gasoline, and other commodities. He gave a detailed analysis of the reasons for the recent price increases. His opinions were largely the same as those put forward by Huang Yuanbin, Shi Kuiling, and others, that is, the price increases were caused by inflation, excessive floating capital, speculative manipulation, the issue of self-provided foreign exchange, the Supervisory Committee's foreign exchange report, and the lack of coordination among various departments. Liu also analyzed the reasons for the price increase of various commodities one by one. Finally, he put forward concrete opinions on price control measures, such as cracking down on hoarding, increasing production, controlling materials, and strengthening transportation. He also said that people from all walks of life in Shanghai, whether in charge or ordinary people, believe that control is necessary. The report was highly praised by all the council members. It is reported that the entire control will be based on the reports of Liu and others in the future.</p>
<p>[Another Dispatch] The three members of the National Economic Council who went to Shanghai to investigate prices rushed to draft a report after returning to Nanjing. Regarding the financial part, after exchanging opinions with Zhang Jia'ao, Yu Hongjun, Chen Guangfu, and others, it has been drafted and submitted to President Zhang. The report is divided into five major sections and seventeen items, the main ones being general finance (domestic) and foreign exchange (foreign). In addition, imports and exports, overseas remittances, smuggling, etc. are also mentioned. The National Economic Council will discuss it soon and make important decisions based on it. Some revisions will also be made to the financial execution techniques. It is said that the report on the part of the price investigation in Shanghai is being drafted, and it can be drafted in two or three days.</p>
<h3>US Considering China Policy, Ross Urges Release of Wedemeyer Report</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] Acting US Secretary of State Lovett said: Senior government officials are considering US policy toward China (including economic and military aid matters). When reporters asked whether the United States intends to grant loans and weapons to China, he said: He cannot answer this question, because this matter is being considered by senior officials above him. Therefore, he does not intend to make any statement until Marshall determines the policy.</p>
<p>[This Newspaper News] New York, 24th Broadcast: Former US Congresswoman Ross, when appointed chairman of the Sino-American Policy Association last night, expressed her opinion: The State Department should reconsider the point of not publishing the Wedemeyer visit to China report. She also advocated that the United States should publish the full text of the agreements signed with third countries concerning China as soon as possible. Ross urged the State Department to appoint new officials to preside over the Pacific policy of the Heavenly Kingdom, and this person must have a firm determination and be unwilling to adopt an appeasement attitude towards the Soviet Union or communism.</p>
<h3>China and Mexico Conduct Minting Negotiations</h3>

<p>[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] The Four Joint Offices held its 355th board meeting on the morning of the 23rd, with Yu Hongjun acting as chairman. The following important proposals were passed: Approved a production loan of 86 billion yuan from the National Resources Commission's China Petroleum Corporation. Approved the purchase price of spring silk from Sichuan Silk Corporation at 32.73 million yuan per Customs Tael, and designated Chongqing China Trust Bureau to handle the purchase procedures, and to deduct the principal and interest of the spring cocoon loan first from the purchase price. Revised the principles of cotton exchange, originally stipulating that yarn mills could apply for another exchange to various banks and bureaus for the purchase of domestic cotton, and could also transfer to loan payment when necessary, and flower shops could also apply for exchange, but must have yarn mill orders; however, the Shanghai Cotton Business Association recently petitioned in Nanjing, explaining that cotton merchants purchase cotton regardless of whether there are orders, and all supply factory needs, and there is no other outlet, so it is not necessary to have order restrictions, and requested modification. It was decided that if the flower shop cannot provide a definition, it should still provide proof of which factory it is purchasing cotton for, and which factory it is selling to, so that it can be deducted from the yarn factory's quota to avoid duplication.</p>

[This Newspaper News] Political Committee member Lei Zhen said to the trustee in Shanghai yesterday: "Regarding the nomination of candidates for our party in the general election, I advocate using the central designation instead of free competition, otherwise it will cause a split within a political party. In European and American countries, political party candidates are also proposed in a planned and unified manner by each party, and party members unanimously support them during the election." The trustee then asked whether it was true that the Kuomintang would support some social elites to participate in the general election? Lei confirmed this statement and said that because our country's party politics is not developed, this method must be adopted. Hu Shi, Wang Yunwu, and others will all receive the full support of this party.</p>

She herself only heard about the news after arriving in Nanjing. She expressed great surprise at the claim that Soviet troops had entered Yili, believing that this was impossible. She said: Compatriots in Xinjiang urgently hope that Director Zhang Zhizhong can return to Xinjiang as soon as possible. Mrs. Bao is a leading figure in the women's circle of Xinjiang and is very capable and graceful. Although she is not good at Mandarin, she spoke eloquently and was very kind. She wore a Western-style suit and was tall and strong, far exceeding the ladies of Jiangnan. She finally said that meeting the reporter was the most pleasant thing.</p>

<p>[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie arrived at Haneda Airport here at 7:30 am on the 23rd by C45 aircraft from the United States.

<h3>Rumor that US Proposes New Plan for Convening Peace Conference on Japan</h3>
<p>[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] Acting US Secretary of State Lovitt said at a press conference on the 22nd that there was a good opportunity to convene a preliminary peace conference on Japan before the end of this year. He said: He does not know how good the opportunity is. He said: The basic differences between China, the Soviet Union, and the United States still need to be negotiated and resolved. China's compromise plan for the voting procedure has been sent to the US government and is still under study by the authorities, and a response will be given at an appropriate time. When asked whether the Soviet Union had directly or indirectly expressed its acceptance of China's plan, Lovitt replied: He knew nothing about it. Lovitt also announced that the US Minister to the Soviet Union (former Director of the State Department's Far East Division) Hamilton had been called back to the country to serve as Marshall's representative, because MacArthur's political adviser Acheson had died in a plane crash, so he will assist Marshall in handling the peace conference on Japan. He also said that negotiations on matters related to the convening of the preliminary peace conference on Japan are currently being directly negotiated between the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union and the Soviet Permanent Bureau because the Soviet Ambassador to the United States is not in Washington.</p>
<p>[Central News Agency, New York, 22nd] A Newsweek reporter received a confidential report last week that: The US government proposed a new plan last week for convening the peace conference on Japan, making concessions to China and the Soviet Union, which may break the deadlock. In the revised US compensation plan, China's compensation has been increased from 20% to 30%, and the Soviet Union's has been increased from 3% to 4%. At the same time, the new plan states. The United States will propose an allocation of 18% from its requested 28% to be distributed to other countries. However, whether the Soviet Union is willing to participate in the meeting in the form proposed by the United States will be the determining factor in whether it receives this compensation allocation.</p>

<h3>How to Save the World's Crisis?</h3>
<p>A Reappraisal of Inferiority Complex and Pessimistic Atmosphere</p>
<p>Due to the U.S. and Soviet representatives' tit-for-tat accusations at the United Nations General Assembly, and General MacArthur's excessive leniency in governing Japan, a kind of panic and pessimism has recently arisen in Chinese forums. It seems as if a third world war is imminent, and China will be engulfed in this future great war. The two articles, "How to Save the Future World's Serious Crisis?" by Huang Yanpei, recently published in Ta Kung Pao, and the reprinted "A Pebble in MacArthur's Hand" by Wang Yunsheng, can be considered the most prominent examples. Both of them criticized MacArthur's support for Japan and predicted that in the future, Japanese militarists would land in Northeast China during the Third World War, fighting against the Soviet Union on one side and directly executing the task of "anti-communism" and even "剿共" (suppression of communists) against China on the other. This kind of argument is not only full of an inferiority complex and a pessimistic atmosphere, forgetting China's position on the international stage after the war, but also contains a strong poison, confusing the eyes of general readers, preventing them from seeing the development of the world situation in the future, and causing them to fall into the abyss of depression and pessimism.</p>
<p>If we really want to study where the crisis of the world situation lies in the future, and then seek a way to save it, we must first recognize the international situation after the war and even at present. The most important point is that among the many factors in predicting the evolution of the world situation, we must not forget everything about China itself. Because, in any case, after eight years of long and bloody war, China has its own independent right to speak on the world situation, at least on the Far Eastern situation.</p>
<p>Looking at the world after the war, it has been more than two years since Germany and Japan surrendered and the war ended. The new era of peace and democracy that people longed for during the war has not only not arrived in the world, but true peace seems even more distant from the world because of the way the Allies have also been slightly tainted with the colors of aggressor nations. Especially after the emergence of the new Communist International, the opposition between the two major camps in the world seems particularly obvious. This sad phenomenon is indeed bound to disappoint those who hoped for peace after the war. However, from a general point of view, it cannot be considered that today is the eve of the outbreak of the Third World War, let alone assert that the nature of the Third World War must be a struggle between the two major groups of the United States and the Soviet Union. I remember that at the end of the First World War, a social revolution took place in the Soviet Union, which not only made a separate peace with Germany, but also met the world with the Soviet regime; when the war ended, most countries in the world expressed dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union, not only did they not establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, but they all regarded the Soviet Union as a flood and a beast. Therefore, at that time, general political commentators were worried about the world, and unanimously believed that the nature of the next war would be a war between socialist countries and capitalist countries. However, history is the best proof. Not only did this worry not come true, but in the Second World War, the Soviet Union initially signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany and remained neutral, and later changed and allied with the United States and Britain, fighting side by side, sharing life and death, and achieving victory after the war. Therefore, looking at the current world situation and thinking about the situation after the First World War, there is really no need to be too pessimistic and fearful about the current world; and to immediately make a dogmatic judgment that the third world war that is about to come must be a war between the United States and the Soviet Union is too simple and too serious.</p>
<p>If we look back at China today, we must not hold an inferiority complex and think that the situation on the international stage in the future will still be a heartbreaking situation of "I am the fish and meat, and people are the knife and cutting board." This eight-year war of resistance not only gave us valuable lessons, but also awakened the soul of the nation; although the current situation in China is not satisfactory, it is not comparable to China after 1919. Looking back on that year, the international situation in the Far East, except for the Soviet Union's efforts in material construction and no time to take care of other things, has changed little. Our enemy, Japan, was flying high after the war, and further increased its arrogance in invading China. Moreover, the warlords in our country occupied one side, brave in internal wars but timid in external struggles, did not know what the country was, and fundamentally could not talk about how to prepare to cope with the future great changes. Therefore, the Second World War broke out because of Japan's invasion of China. However, due to the National Government's completion of the Northern Expedition, unifying the country, enduring humiliation and bearing heavy burdens, and resisting strongly, the Second World War finally ended due to Japan's surrender. As for today's China, although the whole country has not been able to seek progress from stability and embark on the road of national construction and rejuvenation because of the Communist bandits' rebellion and harming the country, the National Government has been determined to move towards the road of democracy on the one hand, and resolutely mobilized to suppress the rebellion and save the country on the other hand. Regardless of whether there is foreign aid or not, it will not be difficult to eliminate the Communist bandits and complete unification within a year and a half, in order to prepare for resisting foreign aggression. This bright prospect will surely encourage the people of the whole country to work together and move forward under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. There have been many peasant uprisings in Chinese history, but once they become bandits, they are doomed to failure. The reason why the Communist bandits are not enough to be a disaster for China is because the Communist bandits are in addition to the nature of bandits, plus the nature of "national traitors," which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Secondly, the post-war international organization, first of all the United Nations organization, its task is to promote international understanding and cooperation, and then to maintain world peace, and its most effective organization is the Security Council, China is also one of the five permanent members, for the solution of any international problem, has the special privilege to exercise the veto power, and the status of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union is exactly the same. The most concerned issue in China after the war is the peace treaty with Japan; in the Far Eastern Commission dealing with the Japanese issue, China is also one of the four powers with veto power. Any opinion of China on the Japanese issue should be given special respect by other countries. Therefore, China can be said to be the only stabilizing force in the Far East, and it has a great role in maintaining world peace, which no one can deny. The reason why Britain and the United States want China to become a unified, strong and democratic country is to make China the largest stabilizing force in the Far East, thereby promoting world peace. Friendly countries still have great expectations for our country. How can we belittle ourselves and think that the United States and the Soviet Union can decide everything in the world?</p>
<p>After the war, China, in order to devote itself to national construction in peace, and to seek progress in stability, seeks international peace and domestic stability in everything. The parting ways of the United States and the Soviet Union is not what we want to hear; moreover, China treats the United States and the Soviet Union equally, and is more willing to see them eliminate their anger. The United States is our ally in times of trouble. During the war, it assisted our country in fighting against Japan. After the war, we still hope that the United States can assist our country in reviving and building the country and jointly maintaining peace in the Far East. Similarly, the Soviet Union is also our friend and has signed a treaty of alliance and friendship. As long as the Soviet Union can abide by the obligations of the treaty, all problems between China and the Soviet Union will not be difficult to obtain a reasonable solution. Situated between the United States and the Soviet Union, we not only do not want to see these two major allies blame each other, but also often want to regard ourselves as a bridge, thereby promoting cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. Our representative often puts forward suggestions to reconcile the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union in any international conference, which is a strong proof. Regardless of whether our wish can be easily realized, as long as China strives to become strong, it will of course have this qualification.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that China's position in the international community today is not what it used to be. As long as we do not be self-conscious and cowardly, and the whole country is united to eliminate the destructive forces that abandon themselves, then we can greatly realize our ambition to stabilize the Far East. Only if we ourselves strive for success and concentrate all our forces to quickly defeat the Communist bandits' attempt to create an international source of chaos in the Northeast will this spark not start a prairie fire. Therefore, if we want to save the future world crisis and prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression, the only way is for the Chinese government to control the main engine in the Northeast. The purpose of the war currently being carried out by the National Army in the Northeast is not only to eliminate the international source of chaos, but also to play a role in easing the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. There will definitely not be a fact that the Japanese army will land in our Northeast again. For the Japanese, if they harbor this ambition, it is just a wild fantasy; as for us Chinese who sing this tune, it will become an absurd heresy!</p>
<p>In terms of the policies adopted by the United States in governing Japan, there are bound to be places that are too lenient. According to common saying, if the United States' Far Eastern policy means that the United States intends to use Japan to oppose the Soviet Union, so it can allow the rise of Japanese aggressive warlords, then this view is either slanderous or delusional. The American government and the public will always remember the bloody lesson of the Pearl Harbor incident. Moreover, the American people unanimously believe that the focus of the Far Eastern problem after the war is on how to control Japan so that its aggressive forces cannot rise again. Among the Japanese people, there may be some flattery to the United States and anti-Soviet remarks, hoping to have a chance to turn over one day, but we must know that this is a strategy for Japan to provoke the feelings of the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States must also know this very well, and the lesson of the Anglo-Japanese alliance has made the American government and the public have a deeper understanding of Japan; even if Americans are forgetful, how can they let the Japanese "put on clothes like a monkey," and come to trample on our territory in the Northeast again!</p>
<p>In short, the reason why these pessimistic political commentators make this strange theory of alarmist is nothing more than to make the general readers unintentionally accept their so-called simple logic of "anti-communism is to be a slave of the United States," and to provide a shield for the Communist bandits to divide the territory of the Northeast. What they do not know is that if we want to prevent the aggression of Japanese forces, we can use our veto power in diplomacy; and domestically, we must have a strong military force to eliminate the Communist bandits. Only when China eliminates the Communist bandits and the Northeast does not fall into the hands of the Soviet Union can the Far East be stable and the world have peace.</p>
<h3>Opinions of Kuomintang Legislators and Supervisors on Nomination of Candidates</h3>
<p>[Our newspaper Nanjing, 23rd dispatch] More than forty Kuomintang legislators of the Legislative Yuan held a discussion meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd to discuss the issue of legislator nominations. Chairman Liu Guanxun pointed out that most legislators felt that there were many omissions in the candidates nominated by the provinces and cities. Only one-fifth of the incumbent legislators were nominated, which was unfair. They proposed: Although the total number of legislators is more than one hundred, even if all of them are elected, they will only account for one-seventh of the future total number. Incumbent legislators have been engaged in legislative work during the period of political tutelage and have a wealth of experience. Some legislators have been loyal to the party for more than their lifetime, and many have made great contributions to the revolution. If they cannot be nominated, it is unfair. It was decided that Liu Guanxun, Sun Jiulu, Tan Tiwu, and ten others should report this situation to President Sun and Vice President Wu, hoping that the central government would seriously handle the nomination matters and take the reports from the provinces and cities as the ultimate basis.</p>
<p>[Another dispatch] Kuomintang supervisors of the Supervisory Yuan held a discussion meeting on the morning of the 23rd, chaired by Cui Shushu. The main points of the discussion were as follows: Recently, many disputes have arisen in various provinces and cities due to the list of candidates. The central government should be requested to implement the spirit of impartiality and make a decision with full authority. Regarding the issue of participation in elections by friendly parties, the party should be requested to adhere to the spirit of harmonious consultation and reach an agreement as soon as possible, so as to avoid affecting the election affairs. Most of the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan have served the party and the country for a long time. Those who do not participate in the election this time, the government should also find ways to use them, saying that they will continue to serve the country, so as to avoid discontent. Finally, it was decided to appoint several supervisors to form a sub-committee to sort out and make textual revisions, submit them to the discussion meeting for discussion, and send them to the central government for adoption.</p>

<h3>Amon Stated at a Press Conference: Britain is Relying on Its Own Efforts for Recovery; Economic Recovery Does Not Entirely Depend on U.S. Loans</h3>
<p>The following are important questions and answers from the press conference held by the British delegation to China yesterday morning:</p>
<p>What is the British public opinion on the Hong Kong issue? Sir Amon replied that it was not raised.</p>
<p>What is the outlook for Britain's recovery? Lord Amon replied that Britain's recovery will depend on its own hard work, not necessarily on U.S. loans. Member of Parliament Harrison said that the difficulty of Britain's economic recovery is not necessarily the lack of U.S. dollar positions, but the lack of customers for British goods; the slow recovery of other countries after the war has affected the progress of Britain's recovery, and China is one of these countries.</p>
<p>What are your suggestions for Sino-British economic cooperation? Member of Parliament Roberts replied that Britain needs soybeans, grains, eggs, and other items from China, and China also needs British production machinery. Currently, Britain has surplus products for export, while China does not. Therefore, if Britain wants to trade with China on a large scale, it must first provide credit loans to China, which is the difficulty. However, the prospects for Sino-British economic cooperation are very good.</p>
<p>What are your opinions on China's refusal to open inland waterway navigation? Lord Amon replied that China's refusal may indicate that China is not yet ready to discuss such issues with Britain. Britain's imports allow ships from all countries in the world to enter, and Britain will never ask other countries for what it cannot allow others itself. The opinion of Du Yuesheng, chairman of the China Shipping Association, is a valuable suggestion.</p>
<p>What are your views on the peace treaty with Japan? Sir Amon replied that Britain hopes that the peace treaty can be established as soon as possible so that the world can return to normal, but prudent measures must be taken at the same time to avoid leaving trouble for the future; this should be the case for both Japan and Germany.</p>
<p>What are your views on the establishment of the European Communist International? Member of Parliament McEntee replied: "We do not wish to comment on this matter, but the British people firmly believe that the democratic politics of socialism is the only way to achieve prosperity and lasting peace. Any country that does not give its people the freedom to establish a dictatorship is violating the greatest interests of people all over the world."</p>
<p>Britain's Social Reforms Have Achieved Significant Results</p>
<p>At this point, the head of the British Information Office suggested that the delegation describe the Labor Party's policies. McEntee also gave a concise account, saying that after the Labor Party came to power, it devoted itself to extensive social reforms, the main points of which are:</p>
<p>Family Allowance System - Currently, British families with four children of school age can receive a government allowance of fifteen shillings per week. This is a great help to families and a great burden to the government.</p>
<p>Social Insurance System - Provides protection for the sick, unemployed, and elderly, which is very important to the welfare of workers and has gained great support.</p>
<p>National Health Service - The main point is the nationalization of hospitals, so that British people can get the best medical services regardless of their economic circumstances.</p>
<p>Veterans' Allowance System.</p>
<p>Agricultural Minimum Wage Regulations, which will be implemented after the Agricultural Act is passed in Parliament. This move will completely change the status of farmers in Britain and make the increase in food production successful. In summary, today is the period of the greatest social reform in British history. In the agricultural sector, there is a possibility of cooperation between China and Britain, because Britain is famous for manufacturing small-scale agricultural machinery, and the degree of agricultural mechanization in Britain itself is very high, so its agricultural machinery and expertise can help China improve its agriculture in the future. The reception ended at 11 o'clock.</p>
<p>Shui Xiangyun's Welcoming Speech Blesses British Workers</p>
<p>Shui Xiangyun, chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, said in his speech at the reception for the British delegation to China yesterday: "Among the members of your delegation are two Labor Party members who were born as workers, representing your country's workers to visit our country's workers, which shows your country's importance and concern for our country's workers. We are very fortunate to have this. The party in power in your country is the Labor Party. This visit to Shanghai will definitely provide guidance on the organization and activities of Shanghai workers.</p>
<p>Finally, on behalf of the Shanghai working class, I would like to pay tribute to your country and ask you to bring this respect to all the workers in your country. I wish you all success and good health!" Then, the head of the delegation, Lord Amon, delivered a brief speech of thanks. After the meal, a symposium was held. At the meeting, Lord Amon raised three questions: Does China have a national labor organization? How does the Chinese government handle labor disputes? Do Chinese workers have the right to strike? Chairman Shui immediately replied: The National Federation of Trade Unions is being organized, and trade unions such as postal and maritime workers already have national organizations. When labor disputes occur, the Chinese government arbitrates according to the Trade Union Law. Chinese law allows workers to have the right to strike, but currently the National Government has issued a general mobilization order prohibiting strikes and slowdowns, but this is a temporary phenomenon. The symposium ended at approximately 3 PM.</p>

<h3>U.S. Aid to Europe is Like an Arrow on the String; Marshall Says It Has Reached the Action Stage; Truman Urges Europe to Strive for Self-Help</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 23rd] President Truman convened Congressional leaders at 7:30 PM tonight (4:30 AM Shanghai time) in the White House to discuss aid to Europe.</p>
<p>[United Press, New York, 22nd] Marshall said at the New York Herald Tribune forum today that the U.S. action to revive Europe is like an arrow on the string. President Truman also sent a message to Mrs. Wright, the initiator of the two associations, saying that the decisions taken by the United States will drastically affect the relationship between the United States and the entire world. Truman's letter stated: We must be extremely cautious to ensure that the steps we take truly achieve the purposes we intend. We must face the fact that the United States cannot revive Europe alone. Our effectiveness lies only in assisting Europe's own self-help. We must especially grasp the fact that what we do does not harm our own economic life. There can be no stable world until the people of Europe fully contribute to the stability of the world, and the United States will have no complete peace and security.</p>
<p>Marshall's speech criticized the inappropriateness of mentioning the "Marshall Plan" everywhere and at all times. He said that in fact there was a "suggestion" but no "plan". We are currently drafting a plan as a suggestion to the U.S. Congress. The research and preparation phase is nearing completion, and the time to take action is at hand. He said that most of the State Department officials currently work seven days a week, cooperating with other government departments to prepare aid proposals. Therefore, when it is completed, it will truly become a plan of the U.S. government, not a plan of any department or organization.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Attempts to Control the Middle East; The U.S. is Considering Timely Aid</h3>
<p>[United Press, Washington, 22nd] It is reported that the Harriman Committee is studying a "Little Marshall Plan" to aid the Middle East. They believe that the United States must prevent other parts of the world from lacking opportunities and resources when the Marshall Plan is implemented. The committee believes that the Middle East is another area of political conflict, and the Soviet Union is attempting to gain political power in the region. If the Middle East aid plan is implemented, Palestine will be the economic protagonist, as it is the only region with industry. Aid to other countries in the Middle East should focus on developing oil mines and improving agricultural and irrigation systems.</p>
<h3>Western European Representatives Express Deep Concern; The U.S. Reduces the Level of Aid; The Implementation of Aid to Europe is Being Discussed</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Diplomatic authorities here recently revealed that the negotiations between the representatives of the Paris Sixteen-Nation Conference and U.S. government officials have encountered three problems that may become a serious test of cooperation between Europe and the United States. The first is the aid provided by the Western Hemisphere other than the United States. The report of the Paris Conference stipulated that Canada and Latin America should provide materials worth 6 billion yuan within four years. Francois, chairman of the Paris Economic Cooperation Committee, and U.S. officials are studying the issue of who will pay this huge sum.</p>
<p>The second is the issue of organizing a continuing aid institution. Francois and his colleagues held discussions on this matter today. Three more problems have arisen: namely, what kind of say will the United States have in this European-based institution that will supervise the entire plan; what relationship should this institution have with the U.S. institution that will be established to manage the implementation of the Marshall Plan on the U.S. side; and what kind of cooperation should this institution have with existing European institutions such as the European Economic Cooperation Committee and the World Food Committee. The third is the amount of U.S. dollars that the United States can provide. European representatives and U.S. officials are drafting a formula so that the figures proposed by the Paris Conference will not be reduced to aid equivalent to relief.</p>
<h3>The Remaining Balance of the U.S. Loan to Britain Will Be Difficult to Thaw in the Short Term</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Treasury Secretary Snyder revealed today that he has informed British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton that he cannot take final action on unfreezing the remaining 400 million yuan of the British-American loan until he has consulted with Congressional leaders. This issue is still under study and is one of the topics to be discussed with British experts.</p>
<h3>Knudsen Advocates Reducing the Amount of Aid to Europe</h3>
<p>[This newspaper report] New York, 24th broadcast; Washington report, Republican Congressman Knudsen, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said today that the federal economy cannot allow the implementation of the Marshall Plan on the one hand and the reduction of taxes by 4 billion yuan on the other. He believes that when Congress discusses the aid to Europe plan next year, the amount of aid to Europe will be limited to 1 billion yuan, and it will be impossible to exceed this amount.</p>
<h3>Italy Applies to the U.S. for a Loan of 170 Million U.S. Dollars</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Radio Rome reported that the Italian government has ordered its ambassador to the United States to submit a request to the State Department for an emergency loan of 172 million U.S. dollars.</p>
<h3>France Sells Gold Worth 1.5 Billion U.S. Dollars</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] People from the French Embassy here revealed that France has sold gold worth as much as 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in the past three years, and the current gold reserves are only 455 million U.S. dollars, as well as a small number of equalization fund gold reserves. Since July 1 of this year, a total of 250 million yuan has been sold, most of which has been sold to the United States.</p>
<h3>Zhdanov Writes an Article Attacking the Marshall Plan</h3>
<p>[United Press, Moscow, 22nd] Zhdanov, an important member of the Soviet Politburo, published a statement in Pravda today, which took up two full pages, calling on communist party members and sympathizers around the world to fight together against U.S. imperialism's occupation of the world. He also stated that the Soviet Union should come forward to lead the effort to smash the Marshall Plan and prevent the United States from turning Europe into its "forty-ninth state."</p>
<h3>The Conservative Party Proposes an Amendment to the King's Speech in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Opposition leader Churchill and five other Conservative members of Parliament today proposed an amendment to King George VI's speech in the House of Commons yesterday, criticizing his failure to ensure national leadership to cope with Britain's economic crisis. The amendment is tantamount to an impeachment case against the government.</p>
<h3>To Cope with the Serious Political and Economic Situation, Ramadier Forms a New Cabinet; The de Gaulle Faction Attempts to Seize Power</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd] After the French cabinet resigned en masse yesterday, Prime Minister Ramadier has formed a new cabinet with 13 cabinet seats, including 7 members of the Socialist Party, 3 members of the Popular Republican Movement, 2 members of the Radical Socialist Party, and 1 independent. Most of the cabinet members served in the previous cabinet, but several have changed positions. Ramadier told reporters that "in order to cope with the serious political situation, we feel that it is necessary to organize a concentrated cabinet to give it the power that is currently urgently needed."</p>
<p>Ramadier said that there are no members of the "French People's Alliance" led by de Gaulle, which won the election last Sunday, in the new cabinet, because "only parties that have representatives in parliament" can participate in the cabinet, and de Gaulle's party has no representatives in parliament. The new cabinet held its first cabinet meeting after midnight.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd] Prime Minister Ramadier declared today that the French political climate is full of electricity and nervous tension has reached its peak. The labor movement has become a political movement, the purpose of which is to overthrow the regime and prevent production. This harm to the republican system comes from the Communist Party and the de Gaulle faction and must be appealed to the National Assembly.</p>
<p>[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Prime Minister Ramadier has formed a smaller cabinet and put economic affairs under the command of a national economic minister. The former economic minister Philippe, the agriculture minister Prereliang, and several cabinet members who echoed the de Gaulle faction will all be kicked out of the new cabinet.</p>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 23rd] De Gaulle's spokesman declared today that the leader of the French national liberation will use the victory in the municipal election to demand the re-election of the National Assembly in order to seize power. De Gaulle had already won the support of nearly half of the members of the National Assembly before the municipal election. If he can win the support of two-thirds of the members of the National Assembly, he can vote to automatically dissolve the National Assembly and hold a general election. If he only wins a majority, he can vote to dissolve the National Assembly and submit the issue of re-election to the people for a referendum.</p>
<h3>List of French New Cabinet</h3>
<p>[United Press, Paris, 22nd] The list of the new French cabinet is as follows: Prime Minister Ramadier (Socialist Party) Foreign Minister Piche (Popular Republican Movement) Minister of National Defense de Gaulle (Popular Republican Movement)</p>
<p>Finance Minister Hsu Shou (Popular Republican Movement)</p>
<p>Chief of General Affairs Chuanchuan (Radical Socialist Party) Interior Minister Tap (Socialist Party) Minister of Justice Marie (Radical Socialist Party) Minister of Education Naiqilian (Socialist Party) Minister of Economy Moshu (Socialist Party) Minister of Social Affairs Mei Yi (Socialist Party) Minister of Industry Laigust (Socialist Party) Minister of Agriculture Lukklo (Independent) Minister of Colonial Affairs Juxiate (Socialist Party)</p>
<h3>Iranian Parliament Passes a Bill Rejecting the Iran-Soviet Oil Agreement; Suggests the Government Reopen Negotiations with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>[Reuters, Tehran, 22nd] The Iranian Parliament passed a bill tonight, equivalent to rejecting the 1946 Iran-Soviet oil agreement, suggesting reopening negotiations with the Soviet Union. The case was drafted by members of parliament at a secret meeting yesterday. Before the vote, Prime Minister Sudaner gave a speech, stating that he was the person who signed the agreement with the Soviet Union and hoped to abide by the agreement. He also reported on his dealings with the Soviet government, which still requested the Iranian parliament to approve the oil agreement.</p>
<p>Sudaner emphasized that maintaining friendship with the Soviet Union is in Iran's own interest. In this regard, he specifically mentioned that the Soviet Union ignored the British, American, and Soviet treaty and refused to withdraw its troops from Iran in March 1946. He also said that the Soviet Union at that time hinted that it wanted to exchange the transfer of oil rights for the withdrawal of Soviet troops, which later became a request for joint development of oil fields. At that time, he refused the Soviet Union's request, and later the Soviet Union's pressure became stronger, so he had to accept the proposal of forming a joint Soviet-Iranian oil company, but stated that it would only be effective after being approved by the parliament.</p>

<p>[Reuters, London, 22nd] Foreign Minister Bevin addressed a gathering of Labor Party members in his constituency of Wandsworth in southwest London, expressing his belief that a socially democratic Britain can become a great independent country between the two major ideologies of free enterprise and communism, and declared that he will never allow Britain to be attached to any side, whether it be Washington or Moscow.</p>
<p>He emphasized that he is determined to maintain a highly efficient army, navy, and air force. As foreign minister, he will never be a part of repeating Chamberlain's mistakes in 1939. Bevin continued: "Those who accuse me of being a war profiteer, I will always throw this lie directly back at them. Britain's struggle for peace is unparalleled by any other country. The indiscriminate accusations after the war are by no means the way to peace." Referring to the four-power foreign ministers' meeting to be held in London in November, he said: "If this meeting fails, it will be a terrible responsibility, and I will do my best to make this meeting a success. We must unify the economy of Germany, but we will never allow Germany to maintain the ability to launch another war."</p>

Furthermore, Executive Council Chairman Hoshijima, who also accompanied him to Wakayama, stated: The so-called talk of a political upheaval is merely a matter of time. In my observation, maintaining the status quo until February of next year will be exceedingly difficult.</p>

<h3>Stalemate in Silk Weaving Dispute: Refusal to Work? Malicious Strike? Workers Push Representatives to Present Three Demands; Management Indicates Preparation to Petition the Central Government</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The labor-management dispute in the city's silk weaving industry remains at an impasse. All silk weaving factories in the Pudong district remained shut down yesterday. Worker representatives Tao Yunshan, Lu Lunyan, and He Hengfu went to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee at 10:00 AM, presenting the labor side's three demands: 1. For factories that are shut down due to management's refusal to allow workers to work, workers' wages should be paid as usual. 2. All factories should immediately settle wages for each month since May according to the regulations of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee. If management delays in settling accounts, the losses suffered by workers should be compensated by management. 3. Clause 2 of the 14th Labor-Management Arbitration Committee's ruling on the silk weaving labor-management dispute, "If management is unable to bear the burden, both parties may independently establish alternative methods," merely provides an excuse for management, creating disputes. Please abolish it. Also, the time limit of "four months" should be changed to indefinite. At the same time, the Silk Weaving Guild denied that management refused workers to work, and claimed that the workers were maliciously striking. It also stated that the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee's repeated changes to the arbitration methods were very unreasonable, and the guild has separately notified the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association that it will send representatives to petition the central government.</p>
<p>According to Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, the arbitration methods of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee cannot be changed. Closing factories under the General Mobilization Order is absolutely not allowed, and strikes are strictly prohibited. If management is indeed refusing workers to work, then management is in the wrong, and wages should be paid as usual. Director Wu also analyzed the reasons why silk weaving factories are willing to close, stating that the black market price of rayon is currently three times higher than the allocation price of the China Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC). The profits from processing the allocated rayon are less than selling the rayon on the black market. The Social Affairs Bureau is now determined to eliminate the rayon black market. Since CTIC holds 100% of the rayon, there should be no black market phenomenon if the allocation is reasonable. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau has requested CTIC to send the allocation list to the bureau this week for re-examination, and to organize a rayon allocation committee to make a public, rational, and scientific allocation, which will not be difficult to eliminate the rayon black market.</p>
<h3>City Government Holds Economic Conference: Decides to Add Gasoline Group; Recommends Controlling Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The 13th Economic Inspection Conference was held in the City Government conference room at 11:00 AM yesterday. The resolutions are as follows: 1. Regarding the inspection of hoarding and illegal operations by non-industry merchants and unregistered yarn and cloth exceeding the deadline, the Yarn and Cloth Group should earnestly implement it. 2. A Gasoline Group should be added, to be handled by the Gasoline Allocation Committee in consultation with the Public Utilities Bureau.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu, at the conference, gave a report to the chairman regarding the strict crackdown on hoarding and speculation, and instructed all groups to strengthen monitoring efforts. Also, due to recent cotton prices being unreasonably raised due to competition among banks and public and private textile factories, yarn and cloth prices have also risen accordingly, greatly affecting people's livelihood. The meeting formulated principles, recommending that the Executive Yuan be able to use effective methods to stop it. According to City Government Secretary-General Shen Zonglian, since the implementation of the emergency measures for limited-time registration and confiscation of overdue yarn and cloth, the investigation results are very good. The cotton stock is sufficient for four or five months, and the yarn and cloth stock is also quite sufficient, with about 60,000 bales of yarn and over 1 million bolts of cloth.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Director Discusses Car Transfer Issues</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue, in a discussion with reporters yesterday regarding the city's car conservation and transfer issues, stated that the current method of suspending car transfers is temporary and not a freeze on cars. According to central regulations, private individuals qualified to use cars are only doctors. The city plans to add supplements when implementing it, relaxing the standard for private individuals qualified to use cars. After the method is drafted and submitted to the central government for decision, car transfers will be allowed to those approved to use cars. To prevent situations such as transfers under false pretenses, a review committee will be jointly organized by the Import Management Committee, the Municipal Council, and the City Government to conduct strict reviews. Transfers will only be approved after passing the review. Regarding the issue of cars that have already been imported or have obtained import permits, after consultation with Mayor Wu, it has been decided that car importers who have registered and obtained import permits can sell the cars to those approved by the government to use cars, or exchange new cars with used cars from those with existing licenses for sale. For private individuals bringing cars back from abroad, a date will also be set, notifying shipping companies that those shipped before the set date will be allowed to import. Those shipped after the set date will be subject to review before a decision is made. As for vehicles from other cities that have already obtained fuel permits, they will no longer be reissued upon expiration, unless they apply for a Shanghai license and formally register in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Director Zhao also stated that there are still 167 cases pending for license applications submitted before the suspension of private car registration on October 14. These unresolved cases will also be reviewed and decided by the review committee.</p>
<h3>Tiered Fuel Allocation: Striving for Fairness</h3>
<p>[Also reported] City Government Secretary-General Shen stated yesterday that the tiered fuel allocation method is still under careful study because there are concerns about unfairness during implementation, and the detailed methods have not yet been determined. Oil companies do not have detailed statistics on fuel consumption for factories, so they are currently investigating the fuel consumption of each factory in order to ensure fairness in future allocations. This matter is being discussed by the Gasoline Allocation Committee and the Public Utilities Bureau.</p>
<h3>Automobile Association: Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Automobile Commercial Guild held a temporary emergency meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures regarding the authorities' freezing of car transfers, suspension of new licenses, and restrictions on private cars. It was decided to submit a petition to the Municipal Council, requesting it to forward a request to the City Government: 1. Car transfers should be unfrozen. 2. The suspension of car sales should be postponed, and the suspension of license issuance should also be postponed. 3. Please carry out a general registration of new and old cars in each car dealership, and set a deadline for sale in order to recover funds. According to the person in charge of the association, after the ban on car sales and the suspension of new licenses, new and old cars of various companies will inevitably be stranded, and huge amounts of funds will be frozen. Member dealerships have been approved by the Import Management Committee to issue car import permits, and many vehicles ordered from abroad have not yet arrived in Shanghai. If they cannot be sold after import and licenses cannot be obtained, the losses will be huge, and foreign exchange will be wasted. In order to uphold national policy and implement conservation measures, we will always abide by government laws and regulations, but we hope that the government will consider the livelihood and interests of merchants and the people.</p>
<h3>Public Education Personnel Clothing Distribution: Quantity and Price Regulations</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The City Government has received instructions from the Executive Yuan regarding the winter clothing distribution method for public education personnel in the city. Each staff member will receive 5 zhang of blue cloth and 1.5 zhang of cotton uniform material. Each public servant will receive 1.5 zhang of blue cloth. The distribution price is 1,700 yuan per chi for blue cloth and 1,300 yuan per chi for cotton uniform material, which is consistent for both Beijing and Shanghai. The City Government has notified CTIC to take note and handle accordingly.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Juvenile Police: Director Yu Expresses Satisfaction</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The police bureau's newly established Children's Police Brigade has now been renamed the Juvenile Police Brigade by Director Yu. Yu, accompanied by Administrative Director Ruan Guangming, inspected the Nantung Children's Education Center in Caohejing yesterday and expressed satisfaction. They are now awaiting the completion of training before being assigned to various entertainment venues and restaurants to carry out advocacy and conservation work.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Sugar Exports to Japan: Still Undetermined</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Taiwan Sugar Corporation, in order to promote the Taiwan sugar export plan, negotiated with General MacArthur's headquarters to ship 25,000 tons of medium-grain white sugar to Japan, offering a price of US$275 per ton, with all transactions in cash. It is now heard that General MacArthur's headquarters hopes to calculate according to the New York market price of US$0.05 per pound, which only amounts to just over US$100 per ton. Therefore, the negotiations have not been close for a while. The company is currently awaiting a telegram. Once a settlement is reached, the company will implement the plan for the second batch of Taiwan sugar exports to Japan.</p>
<h3>Danger of Nationally Refined Kerosene: Due to Adulteration by Retailers; Manufacturers State Reasons to the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Previously, the Price Evaluation Council decided to ban all factories from refining kerosene from diesel oil. Yesterday, representatives of the Nationally Refined Kerosene factory went to the Social Affairs Bureau to explain the composition of Nationally Refined Kerosene to the Price Management Section. They stated that the density of diesel oil is 36 degrees, imported kerosene is 45 degrees, gasoline is 60 degrees, and Nationally Refined Kerosene, which is refined from diesel oil, has a density lower than imported kerosene, around 40 degrees, and the burning degree is also lower than imported kerosene. However, retailers often mix half imported kerosene and half gasoline with Nationally Refined Kerosene, passing it off as imported kerosene for sale. This mixed oil has a very high density and a high flash point, so it is also very dangerous. However, the adulteration is done by retailers, and the Nationally Refined Kerosene factory cannot be responsible. Therefore, in order to prevent the sale of this dangerous type of oil, the Social Affairs Bureau should crack down on retailers who adulterate. Banning the oil refineries now is tantamount to "throwing out the baby with the bathwater," which will only increase the number of unemployed workers and destroy the foundation of our country's oil refining industry. The Social Affairs Bureau's Price Management Section believes that the oil refinery's explanation is not without reason, and will submit a report to the director to consider the proposal to lift the ban.</p>
<h3>Mayor to Leave Shanghai Today or Tomorrow: To Recuperate in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu previously felt extremely tired due to handling municipal affairs and urgently needed rest. After submitting a request to the central government for a two-week leave, it was delayed due to various reasons. Now that the chairman has left Shanghai and returned to Beijing, and many other matters have been concluded, he has decided to leave Shanghai today or tomorrow with his wife to recuperate elsewhere. It is learned that his destination is Beiping. During his leave, municipal affairs will be handled by Secretary-General Shen.</p>
<h3>United Power Plant Contract: Arbitration Does Not Harm Sovereignty; Reduced Costs and Many Advantages; Direct and Indirect Benefits</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Council previously opposed Clause 13 of the United Power Plant contract, which stipulated that if there are disputes, an arbitrator should be designated by the president of the International Court of Justice for arbitration, believing that it would harm sovereignty. Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue told reporters yesterday that he had visited Dr. Wang Chonghui for this matter to request him to study the contract's contents. Dr. Wang believed that the International Court of Justice is composed of representatives from the judicial circles of various countries, and arbitration is a progressive method in judicial trials and does not involve any loss of sovereignty.</p>
<p>Director Zhao further stated that the purpose of the United Power Plant is to reduce the cost of electricity in Shanghai, and it has many advantages. For example, the six power plants originally intended to purchase a 10,000 kW generator each. Due to the establishment of the United Plant, only one 60,000 kW generator needs to be purchased, which is much cheaper in terms of unit price. The six generators originally required six groups of personnel to manage, but now only one group with higher technical skills is needed. In addition, each plant originally needed to set up a standby generator, totaling six, but now only one is needed. The United Power Plant plans to divide into four departments: power generation, transmission, distribution, and electricity consumption. The United Power Plant will generate and transmit electricity to each company, and then each company will distribute it to users. The establishment of the United Power Plant requires money, talent, and materials. Purchasing a 100,000 kW generator requires US$12 million, and the maintenance costs and all expenses after shipping to China also require US$10 million, so the total funds required are approximately US$20 million. However, after Chinese and foreign cooperation, the capital invested by foreigners can be used to directly purchase generators abroad and ship them to China, while the capital from the Chinese side will be used for maintenance costs and expenses. The United Power Plant is preparing to complete its preparations within five years, generating 100,000 kW per day (the current six companies can already generate around 170,000 kW), and then increasing it to 500,000 kW as needed. If it can be successful in the future, it can increase the equivalent of US$20 million in wealth each month in terms of production and indirect benefits. The required burden is only several hundred thousand US dollars per year, so it is also very cost-effective from an economic standpoint.</p>
<h3>Paper Inspection Group's First Resolution: Magazines and Books Should Use Domestic Paper as Much as Possible; Page Numbers for Weekly, Bi-Weekly, and Monthly Magazines Are Prescribed; Correct the Habit of Returning Newspapers to Avoid Wasting Paper</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Conservation Movement Committee's Paper Conservation Inspection Group held its first meeting at the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than ten people attended, including Pan Gongzhan and Yu Wen from the Cultural Movement Committee, Tan Yimin from the Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhu Xubai, Yan Fuzhou, Jiang Jianhou, and Zhu Jiajun from the Municipal Government's News Office, Yuan Wenzhang and Chen Su from the Social Affairs Bureau, Li Zikuan from the Newspaper Industry Guild, Li Bojia from the Book Industry Guild, Yang Yunzhong from the Letterpress Printing Industry Guild, and Huang Zhongming from the Color Printing Industry Guild. Chairman Zhu Xubai reported on the establishment of the Paper Conservation Inspection Group. According to the resolution of the expanded meeting of the Conservation Movement Committee on October 14, the conservation of magazine paper will be implemented from November 1. The implementation period is approaching, and we should seek high-level insights on how to implement it. Subsequently, Pan Gongzhan, Li Bojia, Li Zikuan, Yuan Wenzhang, Chen Su, and others successively expressed their opinions, describing in detail the practical paper conservation methods for newspapers, news agencies, magazines, and books.</p>
<p>Printing Address Should Be Clearly Stated on Printed Materials</p>
<p>The discussion of each case then began, and the following resolutions were made: 1. Please instruct the Shanghai Pie Newspaper Guild to inform the newspaper delivery industry through the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau that the daily newspapers and evening newspapers (including large and small newspapers) that are recognized for sales are limited to the actual sales volume, and to correct the habit of returning newspapers to avoid wasting paper. 2. In order to facilitate the inspection of paper conservation, the name and address of the printing house that prints books and magazines should be stated on the last page of the book or magazine. 3. If a newspaper or magazine is suspended, the publisher should report it to the local government in accordance with the Publishing Law. If the number of days of suspension exceeds the prescribed period, the News Office and the Social Affairs Bureau will investigate and cancel its registration in accordance with the law. During the period of vigorously conserving paper, news agencies are allowed to continue registering, but they should use domestic paper as much as possible.</p>
<p>Cannot Expand Beyond Original Width</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Magazine and Book Paper Conservation Implementation Inspection Method was amended and passed, and the full text is as follows: 1. This method is formulated in accordance with Articles 2, 3, and 5 of the Central Government's promulgated Newspaper, Magazine, and Book Paper Conservation Method, and the resolution of the Shanghai Municipal Conservation Committee. 2. Magazines and books should use domestic paper as much as possible. 3. The page count of magazines in this city shall be in accordance with the following provisions: (A) Weeklies shall be limited to 16 pages per issue, (B) Bi-weeklies shall be limited to 32 pages per issue, (C) Monthlies and above shall be limited to 64 pages per issue.

From November 1, all published newspapers, periodicals, and magazines should be sent to the Municipal Government News Office and the Social Affairs Bureau for record. 7. This method shall be implemented after being resolved by the Paper Conservation Inspection Group meeting and submitted to the Conservation Movement Committee for approval.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Representatives from Four Unions: Re-discussing the Issue of Compiling the Index</h3>
<p>Convening the persons in charge of the four major public utility unions in the city: electricity, tap water, gas, and British streetcars, to discuss the issue of compiling the cost of living index. The four unions have pointed out that the rice price in the worker index is based on broken rice, not Wuhu rice prices. Water and electricity costs are included in the housing rent and the percentage is unreasonable. They request to change the compilation method, and that the prices of daily necessities such as rice, oil, and fuel should use market prices, and water and electricity should be separated from housing rent and become an independent unit, etc. Director Wu explained that housing rent cannot be separated from water and electricity, and there is no fixed regulation on which rice price should be used in the cost of living index. Director Wu also expressed that it is difficult to realize the point that the four unions requested the use of market prices for rice in the index. Since the government has a ration of two dou of subsidized rice, the price of these two dou should be included in the calculation, and the remaining amount can use market prices.</p>
<h3>Dismissing Unemployed Workers Causes a Dispute</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The formalities for dismissing unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear are currently being processed. Yesterday, due to a misunderstanding in the review of the issuance of resettlement fees and materials, more than 100 workers gathered to surround the Unemployed Workers Assistance Council. In the afternoon, they flocked to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition Deputy Director Li. Deputy Director Li agreed to conduct a detailed investigation. If they have indeed been employed, resettlement fees and materials will no longer be issued. If they have resumed work but are temporary or short-term workers and their jobs are not guaranteed, they can still be issued with certification from the factory. Unregistered unemployed workers can also be issued after verification.</p>
<h3>Donations for Supporting the Troops in Each District Must Be Paid by the End of October</h3>

<h3>Two Railway Bureaus Decide to Build Wuxi Station</h3>
<p>[Our Newspaper's Report] The Wuxi Station building on the Beijing-Shanghai Line was built during the late Qing Dynasty. Not only is the location small and cramped, but it has also been eroded for a long time and is becoming dilapidated. According to statistics, the number of passengers boarding and alighting at the station currently ranks second on the entire line. In addition, the industry and commerce are developed and the city is becoming increasingly prosperous. The County Council, the Chamber of Commerce, and other military and political agencies have repeatedly sent letters requesting reconstruction to enhance the appearance. In view of this and in order to follow the suggestions of various circles, the two railway bureaus have decided to start construction on November 10 to meet the needs of the business.</p>

<h3>Lawyer for Kele Files a Petition Requesting On-Site Demonstration; Large Physique Makes Turning Around to Sniping Impossible</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Kele, the British suspect in the murder of Yu Shengxiao, has been interrogated by the court several times. It is now learned that Kele's defense lawyer, Tang Huaiqun, submitted a petition to the court yesterday, stating that Kele is a large man. When driving, he sits in the driver's seat, and his body is already constrained by the steering wheel. Even if he wanted to turn around, it would be impossible due to natural limitations. How could he have turned around to shoot Yu Shengxiao? To obtain conclusive proof, the court is requested to subpoena Peter, a Russian, to drive the 1937 Chevrolet sedan to the court during the next hearing and have Kele perform on the spot to demonstrate whether he could turn around and fire a gun. Judge Zhu Yuhuang of the court, after receiving the petition, believes that Kele and Malae have already performed multiple times during police interrogation. The need for another test will be determined after consideration. The date of Kele's retrial will be decided after the American military court sends the judgment of Malae for reference, which is expected to be in early next month.</p>
<h3>Two Customs Officials Detained for Allegedly Concealing Enemy Property</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The warehouse of Ruichang Hardware Store at 340 Dengtuo Road was originally a secret Japanese warehouse containing a large amount of supplies. During the auction after the Customs took over, it was discovered that there were suspicions of concealment and theft.

Qian was on official business in Europe, and He had been transferred, so they did not appear. The prosecutor conducted a very detailed investigation into the Customs takeover of materials on Dengtuo Road and the auction process, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. At the end of the hearing, the court ordered the detention of Huang and Lin on suspicion of serious crimes, while the others were dismissed.</p>
<h3>Two Customs Officers Sentenced to Imprisonment for Corruption</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The corruption case of He Weiruo and Zhu Xiaoliang, two Jianghai Customs officials, was announced yesterday in the Third Criminal Court of the District Court.

He was a super-grade second-class customs examiner, and Zhu Xiaoliang was a second-class deputy customs examiner, both serving at the Wusong Branch. On June 12 of this year, He led Zhu to carry customs declarations to inspect goods at Xiaogang in Pudong. As a result, they found irregularities in the rice export cargo declaration issued by Chen Fuhua's customs brokerage, which could be extorted. They then negotiated a bribe of six million yuan, scheduled for delivery on the 16th. Afterward, someone reported the matter to the Customs Port Police Station, and He and Zhu were sent to the District Procuratorate and then to the court for investigation.</p>

<h3>Four Defendants in Rumored Eye-Gouging Gang Case Give Evasive Testimony</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Zhou Changqing, a boatman, and his boat partner Xu Sanxiao were rowing across the river at around 1:00 a.m. on August 24 of this year when they were approached by more than a hundred people in boats near the Zhapu Road pier. Claiming to be inspectors, they accused Zhou and Xu of being members of an eye-gouging gang and surrounded and beat them. Xu Sanxiao died on the spot from serious injuries, and Zhou Changqing was also severely injured and on the verge of death. Because Zhou's boat was very small, it immediately capsized due to the commotion. The water police rushed to the scene after hearing the news and rescued Zhou. The crowd dispersed like birds and beasts, and only Zhu Chuanlin, Xu Caiyou, Liu Caigou, and Zhou Liao Fa were apprehended and sent to the District Procuratorate, where Prosecutor Sun Yuanzhen filed a public prosecution for the crime of causing death by injury. Judge Zhong Xianda presided over the trial yesterday. The victim, Zhou Changqing, stated that because it was late at night, he could not see the details clearly and only knew that he was surrounded and beaten by more than a hundred people. The other defendants gave evasive testimony. The court ordered a retrial at a later date.</p>
<h3>Jiangshun Arrives in Shanghai; Ship Arrives, But Woman Does Not; Sister and Brother of Woman Who Jumped Overboard Grieve as They Claim Surviving Children</h3>
<p>[Our Report] The news that a female passenger on the Jiangshun, Wen Yueying, committed suicide by jumping into the river near Wuhu has already been reported. The Jiangshun arrived in port at around 8:00 a.m. yesterday and docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf. Reporters interviewed the captain of the ship, Liu Hongce, and the business director, Zheng Shouye. They reported that the ship sailed from Hankou on the 19th of this month. At around 2:00 p.m. on the 21st, when passing the Qilishan Xizui lighthouse upstream of Wuhu, a female passenger jumped into the river. Another passenger saw it and reported it to the captain, who ordered the ship to turn around and rescue her. After more than ten minutes of searching, nothing was found, so the ship continued downstream. After investigation, it was learned that the female passenger was Wen Yueying, a 23-year-old from Meixian, Guangdong, who was in second-class cabin B, number 3. She previously worked at the Fourth District Engineering Office of the Telecommunications Bureau in Hankou. Her husband, Huang Min, is currently employed at the Central Electrical Equipment Factory of the Resources Committee in Hankou, residing at No. 19 Han'anli, Hankou. Her elder brother, Wen Qihua, lives at Lane 1958, No. 24 Linsen Road in this city, along with her mother and elder sister, Suiying. Wen Yueying has three daughters, the eldest is six years old, named Reng Huang, the second is four years old, and the youngest is three years old. After Yueying jumped into the river, the three daughters and luggage were kept on the ship and taken care of by the captain and business director, but there was no suicide note. After the captain telegraphed Shanghai, the China Merchants Bureau sent someone to report to her brother on the 22nd.

He has already telegraphed Hankou and asked Huang Min to come to Shanghai. However, according to another source, Wen's jumping into the river was due to family problems.</p>

<h3>Defending His Search for Grain for the Enemy, Claiming It Was to Help the People; Two Witnesses Fail to Confirm; Gao Jimin's Hearing Postponed</h3>
<p>[Our Report] Gao Jimin, the former president of the puppet General Power Company, was originally sentenced to ten years in prison by the High Court, but the Supreme Court sent it back for retrial. The High Court held a hearing yesterday to investigate. Gao was accused of colluding with Xia Zhongming, Lan Baosun, Japanese nationals Horita, Matsuzawa, and others during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai to rent the General Power Company. Gao initially served as vice president and later became president. The company was affiliated with the enemy's Dengbu Force and was a special agent organization under the command of the enemy's military police. It purchased rice and supplies for the enemy's Zaibatsu Mitsui and Mitsubishi, which were used by the enemy's army. Later, branches were established in Nanjing, Wuxi, Wuhu, Bengbu, and other places, encompassing all materials in Central China. However, Gao defended himself yesterday, claiming that the company had delivered 46,000 tons of rice to the Rice Control Association for distribution to Shanghai citizens, which was an act beneficial to the people. The court then summoned Chen Guoquan, the director of the puppet Rice Control Association, and Zhou Chunyu, the secretary-general of the puppet Rice Control Association, as witnesses. According to the witnesses, the rice was negotiated for distribution with the Japanese side, and they were not very clear about the organization and tasks of the General Power Company at the time. The court stated that further investigation was needed and ordered a retrial at a later date. Gao remains in custody.</p>

<h3>The Harassment of the "Southern Route"</h3>
<p>(Our Guangzhou dispatch of the 20th) I recently interviewed Ren, the county magistrate of Huaxian, who came to Guangzhou. His talk revealed to us some of the truth about the activities of the communists in the southern part of Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>The area of southern Guangdong Province (known as the "Southern Route" by the Cantonese), includes Zhanjiang City, Huaxian, Wuchuan, Maoming, Xinyi, Lianjiang, and the Leizhou Peninsula. These counties are bordered with Guangxi Province, and have water and land routes to Luchuan and Beiliu in Guangxi. At present, the area where the communist bandits are active is these counties. Zhanjiang City is their biggest target, but because of stronger security forces there, Huaxian has become the county bearing the brunt, because if Huaxian is controlled, Lianjiang, Maoxin, Xinyi and other counties will be threatened at the same time.</p>
<p>Old Troops of Zhang Yan</p>
<p>The communist bandits there can be mainly divided into two groups, which they recognize as the "regular army" or the "People's Liberation Army". One group is led by Zheng Kunlian, Zhang Yan's wife, and Zhuang Tian. The members of this group are mostly political work team student soldiers and others of Zhang Yan's old troops, as well as some primary school teachers and high school students, so they are considered their excellent "cadres." However, their number is not large, and the main force of combat still relies on the troops of the bandit leader Fu Chunmao. Fu was the regiment leader of a puppet army during the war. After the victory, he took this group of people to the bandit army. They are completely remnants of traitors, numbering about two thousand.</p>
<p>Li Ying's Bandit Troops</p>
<p>Another group is Li Ying's troop of about 1,200 men, the so-called "Fourth Regiment of the People's Liberation Army." These so-called "regular army" all have military uniforms, numbers, and are equipped with rifles, light and heavy machine guns, grenades, small cannons, horses, etc. Most of these things were left over by the enemy and puppet troops, and a small part was robbed from the people. In addition, there are some scattered bandits that do not belong to their "regulars", mostly in groups of one or two hundred people. The source of the members is local thugs, unemployed vagrants, and some farmers who have no land to cultivate and are forced to make a living. They are actually bandits and have no political nature.</p>
<p>Wandering Ways</p>
<p>These two bandit troops often wander around the counties of southern Guangdong. Sometimes they are near Zhanjiang, and sometimes they suddenly go to Maoming. When they see places with many government troops, they avoid them. When they know places with insufficient security, they come to harass for a while. So sometimes several hundred bandit troops are found here, and more than a thousand bandit troops are found there. It is thought that they are everywhere, but in fact, it is just their coming and going harassment.</p>
<p>No Fixed Footing</p>
<p>They have no fixed footing, and naturally there is no so-called base. They boast that they are mobile, without worries. Moreover, they are good at night attacks and can endure hardship. However, they lack ammunition, guns, and food supplies. Moreover, most of the bandits have not been trained and lack military knowledge and combat experience. Their combat power is very weak, and their will to fight is also very low. The purpose of their wandering around is to rob the people's self-defense guns with greater force, destroy the grassroots organizations of the government, and try their best to buy over thugs everywhere to establish puppet organizations, send out so-called commissioners, county magistrates, township chiefs, village directors, etc., and organize puppet women's associations, farmers' associations, and establish so-called "underground grassroots organizations." In the places under their control, they use the most brutal means to extort money, forcibly collect grain, and forcibly conscript men.</p>
<p>Rumor Offensive</p>
<p>The bandits' propaganda is quite exaggerated. They use a rumor offensive, saying today that they will attack a certain county seat, and tomorrow they will say that they will attack a certain large town, but the city defenses of the counties in the Southern Route are all built very firmly. Ordinary cities are built with large bunkers, and the bandits cannot easily cross the Lei Pool. For example, the county seat of Hua County, they have also threatened to attack the city more than 40 times, but never once have they been able to approach within 30 li. At present, the military force guarding the area, in addition to the three corps of the security police, relies entirely on local teams and people's self-defense organizations to be responsible. Therefore, they can only do defense work and have not been able to disperse the main force of the bandits.</p>
<p>Strengthening Military Force</p>
<p>According to the observation of Ren, the county magistrate of Hua County, he said that if we can increase some troops and cooperate with local teams, it is not difficult to completely eliminate the communist bandits in the Southern Route. However, he also pointed out that the increasing banditry in the Southern Route is greatly related to the failure to solve the two major problems of land and people's livelihood. Because of social unrest and surplus labor, the communist bandits are given many opportunities, so he believes that the fundamental solution is to solve these two problems.</p>
<p>Suppression and Appeasement Together</p>
<p>Recently, since Chairman Song went to Guangdong, he has decided to first solve the problem of public security, established the Southern Guangdong Bandit Suppression General Command, and appointed Chen Pei, director of the Security Police Department, as the commander-in-chief. At the same time, more than five regiments of troops have been dispatched to the Southern Route to implement suppression and appeasement together. On the one hand, they are tolerant of communist bandits who come to surrender and reform, and on the other hand, they implement suppression with the pressure of thunder. It is believed that the mystery of the strength of the communist bandits in the Southern Route will be revealed in the near future. (Special correspondent Liang Feng)</p>
<h3>Guangdong-Taiwan Material Exchange Decided to Be Implemented from December</h3>
<p>(Our Guangzhou dispatch of the 23rd) The two provinces of Guangdong and Taiwan have decided to implement the exchange of materials from December.

<p>(Further dispatch) The Guangdong Provincial Government Statistics Office recently released the price index of goods sold in Guangzhou in October, which is more than 64,500 times higher compared to the pre-war price level.

<h3>Deputy Speaker of Guangdong Province, etc. Arrive in Changsha to Negotiate Purchase of Hunan Grain</h3>
<p>(Our Changsha dispatch of the 23rd) He Tong, Deputy Speaker of the Guangdong Provincial Assembly, and Huang Bingxun, Director of the Grain Bureau, arrived in Changsha from Guangzhou to negotiate the purchase of Hunan grain to relieve Guangdong. It is reported that 75,000 dan has been decided, but it is difficult to predict whether it can be successfully purchased, as Changsha is officially reporting a grain shortage. He Tong and others will go to the Hankou and Wuhu areas to negotiate the purchase of grain in the near future.</p>
<h3>Anhui Grain Industry Association Federation Established Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Chongqing to Hold Relief Lottery</h3>
<p>(Our Chongqing dispatch of the 21st) The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is promoting a savings movement and decided to organize a relief lottery to develop relief undertakings. It is heard that the face value of each ticket is set at 10,000 yuan, and 50,000 tickets will be issued each time. It is planned to hold six times, and the interval between each time has not yet been decided. It is reported that the total amount of money is 3 billion yuan, with half of it used as prizes (the first prize is 100 million yuan). Twenty percent of the remaining amount will be used for printing, publicity, office expenses, etc., and the other amount will be used as winter relief funds and to build low-income housing, children's welfare stations, and other relief undertakings. When the person in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau was asked, he said that this method can only be implemented after approval by the Ministry of Finance, the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>October Wind of Price Hikes Sweeps</h3>
<p>(Our Guangzhou dispatch of the 20th) On the eve of the October wind of price hikes, Hong Kong dollars took the lead, soaring 700 at once, and gold responded by rising from 280 to 320. "One success leads to the rise of all," and the prices of all goods are rushing forward in a flood-like state. Hong Kong dollars were 800 today, and are expected to advance to 900 early tomorrow, and then 1100, 1200, 1300. At the time of this reporter's writing, a lot of "Western paper" that "can be seen and held in the hand" is still hovering between 137 and 140. Gold is still trading in the black market at 470. The military has launched large-scale operations, forcibly stopping black market trading of gold and banknotes, closing illicit exchange houses, and arresting "speculators" (Cantonese call black market dealers in gold and banknotes "banknote friends"). The situation has stabilized for a few days, but everything has returned to a state of frenzy. As a result, large amounts of funds are flowing south to arbitrage Hong Kong dollars. Recently, the banks and exchange houses here seem to have nothing on their minds except for the two big words "telegraphic transfer." Telegraphic transfer business accounts for more than 80%. The amount of money remitted to Guangzhou from Shanghai, Hankou, and other places reaches 50 billion yuan per day, which is simply an endless flood, with Hong Kong as the final destination. If the Hong Kong exchange rate fluctuates by one foot, the Guangzhou market will never fluctuate by just nine inches. "Digging tail dragons" (speculators) are adding fuel to the fire, coordinating with the momentum coming from Shanghai. There are no less than 300,000 people in Guangzhou who live on salaries. How will they survive this difficult winter? (Reporter Liang Xiaozhong)</p>

<h3>Lishui Establishes Fifth Branch of High Court; Pinghu and Six Other Counties Change to District Courts</h3>

<h3>Wuhu Grain Merchants Purchasing Grain on Behalf of the Grain Department; Breach of Contract and Failure to Pay Case Tends to Ease; Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Li Jiazhong, Released on Bail</h3>
<p>(Our Wuhu, 23rd dispatch) The case of Wuhu grain merchants purchasing grain on behalf of the Grain Department, breaching their contract, delaying payments, and defaulting, has tended to ease. In addition to the 20,000 bags already purchased, the 24 grain merchants plan to purchase another 10,000 bags. For the remaining 20,000 bags, they have requested the Grain Department to pay the market price at the time of purchase. One of the three inspectors of the Grain Department returned to Nanjing this morning to request instructions. According to the grain merchants, the purchase of 20,000 bags on behalf of the Grain Department has already resulted in a loss of 3.12 billion yuan. The purchase of the additional 10,000 bags will require a further loss of 1.98 billion yuan. This 5.1 billion yuan loss will be compensated by collecting an extra 30,000 yuan per bag on the 170,000 bags of export rice shipped from the 24 grain stores to Qingdao and Tianjin. Yan Qingrong, a member of the Wuhu County Council, and others have criticized this matter, accusing Li Jiazhong, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and others of wasting the grain merchants' surcharges in Nanjing, arbitrarily entering into a grain purchase agreement with the Grain Department together with five grain stores, and failing to fulfill the agreement, which has seriously affected the credibility of Wuhu merchants. Li Jiazhong has now been released on bail.</p>
<p>(Our Wuhu, 23rd dispatch) The Grain Department will soon expedite the allocation of 960,000 bags of military and public grain in Wuhu, each bag weighing 190 catties, and will send a Vice Minister to Wuhu to supervise the process. Also, it is reported that the Central Farmers Bank has already started purchasing grain in Wuhu. People from southern and central Anhui in Wuhu will appeal to the central government to allocate funds for the purchase of grain, so as not to affect the people's food supply in Anhui Province. The two should not be confused.</p>

<h3>Shanghai University Produces Its Own Gas; Paper Mill Has Started Operation</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] The gas used by the Shanghai University laboratory in Yangshupu before the war was produced by its own boilers; during the War of Resistance, the school site was occupied by the Japanese army, and all the gas equipment was destroyed. Since returning to school last year for reinstatement, the Chemistry Department has actively sought to restore the old equipment, and once contacted Shanghai Electric Power Company in Yangshupu, but both were unsuccessful due to the large cost. This summer, President Ling Xianyang returned to China from the United States and decided to repair the old equipment and produce gas himself. The cost was 204 million yuan and was completed in mid-October. It is reported that the school's self-made gas is derived from the splitting of oil, and the output in the future will be able to supply the entire school without any concern.</p>
<p>(Also, it is reported) A set of papermaking machines installed in the Shanghai University factory was donated by Chen Pengnian, the general manager of Jiangnan Paper Mill, an alumnus of the school. Recently, the factory has sent engineers to the school to guide the Chemistry Department students in their practice, starting with the self-prepared pulp (raw material is waste cloth, etc.) to the folding of the paper. The produced paper is still considered uniform and clean, and a public performance will be held on the school's anniversary day, November 8.</p>

<h3>Low-Cost Dining at Datong University; Students Pay Only 150,000 per Month</h3>
<p>[Our dispatch] The student dining at Datong University this term is still managed by representatives elected by the students themselves, with elections held every half month. All those elected to run the dining hall are able to fulfill their responsibilities and work hard for the benefit of the public. As a result, students pay only 150,000 yuan per month for dining, and the dishes and rice for each meal are enough to fill their stomachs. Three meals a day, in addition to porridge and ten side dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner are all four-course meals and rich in nutrition. Because there are now more than 1,700 students eating in the school this term, the original dining utensils are insufficient, and the dining hall is also unable to accommodate all of them, so the dining time is divided into two shifts for each meal.</p>
<p>The dining fee for students at Datong University is said to be the lowest among all universities and colleges in Shanghai, because: 1. Rice is allocated by the government; 2. The school authorities subsidize student meals; 3. Due to the effective dining management methods.</p>
<p>The school authorities said that in the midst of rigorous frugality, Datong's dining fee can be so low, which can be said to be a practical achievement of frugality.</p>

<h3>Coal Team Wins Three Consecutive Victories; Faces the Pandas Today; 3:30 p.m. at Donghua Stadium; Fuxing Team Loses 3-0 Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:30, the Carbon Baseball Expeditionary Force played its third game in Shanghai against the Fuxing Baseball Team, which was composed of alumni and students of Fudan University, at the Fudan University Stadium in Jiangwan. About 1,500 fans attended, making the quiet Jiangwan Road lively. Before the game, Miss Shao Yingduo, a female student from the school, presented flowers to the visiting team. Then, the captains of both sides exchanged pennants to show their remembrance. As a result of the competition, although Fuxing borrowed Xiao Keming, the former famous baseball pitcher from Tianjin, to help, the visiting team sent all its elite players to the field. The Carbon Team finally won with a score of 3-0. Principal Zhang Yi held the opening ball ceremony first, and then the competition began. Fuxing first attacked, and the visiting team initially sent a new force to the field, but Fuxing failed to take advantage of the opportunity, so it did not gain anything. When Carbon changed to the main force, they also did not get on base. It was not until the third inning that the visiting team took the lead with one point, and then scored two more points in the fourth inning. As a result, the Carbon Team beat Fuxing 3-0 and won three consecutive victories.</p>

<h3>A Colorful Record of the Gansu Provincial Games: Dispute Arises in the 10,000-Meter Race, Resulting in Double Champions; Wang Peiying Elected "Sports Queen"</h3>
<p>[Lanzhou Air Mail from This City] The grand opening of the first Gansu Provincial Games was briefly outlined in the previous report. In the three days following the opening (13th to 15th), the Games became even more intense. Thirty-seven track and field events not only broke past records in Gansu Province, but the 10,000-meter race on the final day (15th) produced brilliant results close to the national record. Other highlights included news reporters showing off their skills, the 100-meter sprint, the election and coronation of the "Sports Queen," the freestyle bicycle performances, and the equestrian performances at the Yongdeng Military Ranch.</p>
<p>During the Games, many unpleasant incidents occurred, mostly due to unfair judging of athletes from various counties and districts outside of Lanzhou, and the overly enthusiastic cheering squad from Lanzhou City. This caused the other competitors, who already lacked confidence in defeating Lanzhou, to become even more panicked and perform poorly. After several rounds of protests, things were settled through mediation. In the last two days, cheering squads were forbidden from making noise, and the Games were considered to have concluded "successfully."</p>
<p>Sports Queen</p>
<p>The one who stole the spotlight this time was not Wang Sixin (from Lanzhou City), who almost broke the national record in the 10,000-meter race, nor the female team members who almost broke the national record in the 200-meter preliminary relay (with a time of 29 seconds), but the election and coronation of the "Sports Queen." The election was initiated by the Lanzhou branch of the Heping Daily on the fifth day of the Games (14th) and announced by noon the next day. It was clear that business interests outweighed public interest because the ballots were printed on the back of the newspaper, and anyone who wanted to vote had to buy a copy of that day's paper. As a result, Wang Peiying, a talented student from Lintao Women's Normal School in the Ninth District, was elected the "Sports Queen" of this session with 4,512 votes. Li Xichun, also from Lintao Women's Normal School in the Ninth District, was elected "First Runner-up" with 2,863 votes. The Games organizers did not comment on this activity. Only after the closing ceremony did photographers find this short, dark-skinned "Queen" in the crowd. At that point, the authorities from the Heping Daily rushed over with a crown made of red and green paper and placed it on her head, and many cameras were pointed at her. The next morning, the Heping Daily even held a tea party to celebrate them, and the president, Yi Junzuo, wrote a poem for the "Sports Queen" and presented it to her in an elaborate frame. Some criticized this as being a "Shanghai style" affair. In reality, Miss Wang herself was only eighteen years old, a true country girl who, although in her second year of high school, did not have the air of a "social butterfly." She was simply being used as an advertisement by others.</p>
<p>10,000-Meter Dispute</p>
<p>Regarding the 10,000-meter final, in addition to Wang Sixin, who rightfully won first place, there was another first-place winner, Luo Yingzhan from the Second District. This was the result of a dispute: In the early laps of the 10,000-meter final, Luo appeared particularly strong and had a good chance of winning. The second most likely winner was Wang Sixin. Among the twenty participants, about one-third were from Lanzhou City. Several Lanzhou athletes who were far behind surrounded Luo in order to secure the championship for the city, but Luo was unsuccessful in breaking free several times. In the final dash, Wang Sixin won the championship with a time of 36 minutes, 57.4 seconds. Luo finished second, not far behind. However, when it came time to award the prizes, the Second District argued that their athlete, Luo Yingzhan, had been forced into second place due to the encirclement, and the judges did not intervene, which seemed biased. They refused to accept the award. In the end, after much mediation, two first-place winners were declared. It remains to be seen who will represent Gansu in the National Games next year.</p>

<h3>Authorities Consider Improving Rationing System, Adjusting Supplies, and Stabilizing Prices; Rationing of Cooking Oil by Headcount Soon to be Implemented</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] It is reported that the relevant authorities in this city are currently considering ways to improve the rationing system for various supplies. It is said that, in principle, resources will be prioritized for those supplies that have a greater impact and whose supply is not yet on the right track, and then a household rationing system will be adopted as much as possible. For supplies that are more normally supplied, rationing will first be implemented for the citizens most affected, and the rationing amount will be increased or decreased based on the actual situation.</p>
<p>Currently, only sugar is rationed by household. After research by the relevant authorities, it is believed that cooking oil also has value in being rationed by headcount, similar to sugar. The rationing method is currently being actively formulated. It is said that the principle will be to ration one catty of cooking oil per person per month. With a city population of four million, 40,000 dan of oil would be needed each month. The cooking oil will mainly be rapeseed oil. The price will generally follow the negotiated price for cooking oil. This plan is expected to be implemented in November.</p>
<p>The market prices of rice and flour have fluctuated recently, but the sources are abundant, especially for flour, of which this city has a surplus to be used to exchange for other necessary supplies in other areas. In addition to the direct rationing of rice to public educators (approximately 160,000 people), industrial workers (approximately 270,000 people), and several hundred thousand poor households specifically handled, another 150,000 professional workers are now being added, and the quota for poor households has been expanded to 980,000. It can be said that the citizens of this city who are most threatened by high rice prices have been rationed as much as possible. Other citizens can freely obtain rice from the market because the rice supply is abundant.</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Request Cancellation of Requirement to Present Orders for Export Financing; President Zhang Agrees to Consider Reasons</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of cotton merchants requesting the cancellation of the requirement to present orders from yarn factories in order to obtain export financing, President Zhang of the National Bank specifically met with Liu Pingsun and Zheng Zhezheng, representatives of the Cotton Merchants Association of this city, yesterday morning (the 23rd). The representatives presented the reasons for requesting the cancellation of the requirement to present orders from yarn factories in order to obtain export financing, and stated that requiring cotton merchants to provide orders to obtain export financing is equivalent to preventing cotton merchants from obtaining export financing, while other essential consumer goods do not have this restriction.</p>
<p>The cotton inventory in Shanghai is only slightly over 58,000 dan, which is only enough for yarn factories to use for five days. Before the war, Shanghai's cotton inventory always reached over one million dan. Now, as domestic cotton is coming to market, the government should supervise cotton merchants to actively purchase cotton and should not add restrictions that hinder supply, creating shortages and price spikes. Requiring cotton merchants to present orders from yarn factories to obtain export financing is indeed difficult, as mentioned above, and the theory that it is to prevent hoarding is also questionable. Hoarding is not a crime; hoarding and holding goods for speculation should be prohibited. In the current situation where cotton cannot be self-sufficient, it is necessary to facilitate the flow of cotton and increase inventory in order to meet supply and demand and stabilize cotton prices. As for the so-called cotton merchants not only considering their own private interests and seeking low-interest loans, thereby increasing the burden on others, in reality, cotton merchants only hope to finance their operations and do not seek low interest. If the cotton supply is blocked due to a lack of financing and cotton prices rise, it will inevitably increase the burden on many people.</p>
<p>President Zhang took the above points seriously and asked where the incoming cotton was stored and whether it could be concentrated in bank warehouses in order to facilitate control and achieve cooperation between merchants and the government. The representatives expressed their willingness to accept this, stating that cotton for which export financing is obtained can be required to be stored in bank warehouses, but they hope that the government will provide more financing convenience in order to expand business and increase the cotton supply. It is said that President Zhang agreed to consider this and resolve the issue in the short term.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Slightly Increase, Oil Market Turns Bullish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a total of over 13,900 shi of rice arrived in the North and South Markets. The market initially rose and then weakened, and sales were very sluggish. As a result, japonica and indica rice rose by 10,000 yuan, and white rice also increased by 10,000 yuan, but the trend seemed unable to sustain the increase. The supply of wheat flour from Wuxi was very strong, and many were sold, continuing downstream, falling by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. The supply and demand for wheat bran were both scarce, and there were no significant changes. Bean cake was slightly purchased by out-of-town buyers, rebounding by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybeans were firm initially and then leveled off, broad beans fell steadily, red sorghum was sluggish, corn lacked buyers, sesame seeds were purchased in Tianjin, oil factories absorbed them at low prices, and local merchants opportunistically purchased them, recovering from weakness and rebounding by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, with medium-grade sesame seeds also increasing by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The decline in raw kernels was very intense, and with out-of-town buyers suspending operations, local merchants arbitrarily and aggressively sold off, falling by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The oil market turned bullish. Crude oil rose by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, soybean oil increased by 100,000 yuan, and sesame and rapeseed oil increased by over 100,000 yuan. The market fluctuated rapidly and unpredictably. However, the market weakened significantly at lunchtime, forming a pattern of rising in the morning and weakening in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Export Goods Certification to be Implemented Next Month</h3>
<p>The Export Promotion Office of the Export Control Commission has formulated export price review and certification, as well as import methods for packaging materials required for export goods, which have been approved by the Export Control Commission. The office has set a date to implement them next month and is rushing to prepare various application forms. If time permits, it can be implemented as early as the first day of next month. It is reported that the prices of various export goods must be reviewed and certified by the office before they can be exported. Exporters should apply to the office for price review when exporting goods and must attach the transaction contract and the exchange rate of the designated bank. According to the person in charge of the office, the implementation of this method will provide convenience to merchants, so that export goods will not be delayed in export.</p>
<h3>All Short Positions Have Been Liquidated; Stock Market Trend Turns Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, as the stock market reached the date for the closing of forward contracts, most of the long positions were settled in advance, resulting in a continued weak market in the middle of the day. When all short positions had been liquidated, the market gradually stabilized with the help of looser credit. Buyers returned to the market, and the market became more firm, but the process was still volatile, with prices easily falling after rising. The market was slightly stable in the morning, and Yong Yarn opened higher at 285 yuan and 295 yuan. However, it was still difficult to deliver goods in the open market, and interest rates were still 2 jiao 7 and 3 jiao 1 fen. After 10 o'clock, the interest rates fell to a low of 276 yuan for immediate delivery and 287 yuan for forward delivery. The remaining short positions were cleared, and credit generally loosened. The closing prices at noon rose to 286 yuan and 295 yuan. Cold stocks such as Commercial Press Cement remained at low prices. Rongfeng Jinglun Matches did not rise, and the remaining stocks saw some stability. As a result, compared to the previous closing prices for immediate delivery, Lian'an and Zhongxing were flat, Commercial Press Cement fell by 10%, and Matches Jinglun and Rongfeng fell by 5%. Yong Yarn, Xinnuo, China Textile, Qinxing, and Huaxin rose slightly, and the rest saw small declines. For forward delivery, Meiya Huafeng and Jingfu fell by 5% each, and Yong Yarn, Xinnuo, and Qinxing fell slightly. Buyers were strong in the after-market, and Yong Yarn jumped to 294 yuan and 304 yuan. The highest prices reached 298 yuan for immediate delivery and 308 yuan for forward delivery. Open market bids suddenly fell, returning to 303 yuan at the close. Huaxin, Xinnuo, and Meiya were also pulled higher. As a result, compared to the morning closing prices for immediate delivery, Huaxin, Meiya, Zhongsi, China Textile, Qinxing, and Underwear rose by about 5%. Yong Yarn, Xinnuo, Huafeng, Commercial Press, Matches, Jinglun, Xinguang, French, Xinhua, Rongfeng, Tongyi, and Zhabei Lian'an rose slightly. Jingfu and Fengshang were flat, and Xinyi fell slightly. For forward delivery, Xinguang, Huafeng, Dongxing were flat, and Yong Yarn, Xinnuo, Meiya, and Jingfu rose slightly. The rises and falls of old stocks in the open market were mixed.</p>
<p>Arbitrage trading was not active yesterday as long positions were liquidated quickly. The discount rate fell as a result, with the combined interest rate at about 1 jiao 4 to 1 jiao 9, while long positions required 1 jiao 7 to 2 jiao 4. Yong Yarn opened at 12 yuan and fell from 12 yuan 5 to close at 9 yuan 8. Meiya fell from 22 yuan to 17 yuan, ending at 18 yuan. Xinguang was around 1 yuan 5, and Xinnuo fell from 7 yuan 5 to 5 yuan 5.</p>
<h3>Domestic Bonds Fall, Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Government bonds fell slightly yesterday. While Series 552 and 503 rose, Series 555 fell. Series C opened at 15,700 yuan, with a high of 16,000 yuan and a low of 14,900 yuan, eventually struggling around 15,200 yuan. The total turnover was about 3 million yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing prices, Series A and B fell by 400 yuan, and Series C, D, and E each fell by 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks initially traded flat and then rose. Ewo Yarn opened at 166,000 yuan and rose from 165,000 yuan to close at 171,000 yuan. This was because gold and banknotes gradually rebounded, and the black market was stimulated again. Yarn, flower, and securities companies were buyers, while foreign merchants and money exchangers were sellers. As a result, compared to the previous closing prices, Paper was flat, and Ewo Yarn, Ewo Beer, Navigation, and Land Reclamation rose by 5% each. British Union, Deji, Guang Steel rose slightly.</p>

<h3>Tea Market Turns Lively</h3>
<p>Foreign Tea Market: Recently, although foreign firms such as China Tea Company and Yongxing Tongfu have been actively buying, the sellers have been stubbornly holding firm, so transactions have been sporadic. It is learned that British Jardine Matheson is also preparing to collect this year's Keemun black tea, and it is reported that Zhenhe Tea has also planned to collect samples and submit them to the company for selection. As for domestic tea, which has been stagnant for a long time, it is still thriving due to the sales in the local market and by out-of-town buyers, and there is no sign of a sharp decline. Prices remain firm.</p>
<h3>Rayon Rises, Silk Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market rose again. Due to the United Company's replenishment of materials and labor, silk factories were very interested in buying, so the market rose as soon as it opened. The 120 brand Ziyouguang first bid 72 million yuan, and the closing price at noon was 66 million yuan. The market continued to advance in the afternoon, and the final selling price was 79 million yuan, 7 million yuan higher than the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for factory-made silk was similar to the previous day. Only small lots were traded at 58 million to 59 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to the rise in rayon prices, sentiment turned around, and the transaction price for small lots was 40 million yuan, which had not been done at the opening.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market opened flat. Daizhai and Huaqiang silk fabrics traded around 21 million yuan, fluctuating between 110,000 and 150,000 yuan. Later, upon hearing that rayon prices were rising, the market rose, and the final price for next-day delivery was 1.7 million yuan. In the afternoon, factory-made silk also rose, and the market became firm. Hua Town, which had been weak the previous day, opened at 44,500 yuan. Yesterday, high-grade goods reached 50,000 yuan, and other goods also improved.</p>
<h3>Out-of-Town Buyers Purchase, Market Rises; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Recover After Weakness; 42s Blue Phoenix Rebounds by 1.3 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton yarn market rebounded as a result of the previous day's excessive decline. The market opened with bargain hunting, and out-of-town buyers, especially those from Hankou, purchased actively, so the market rose. As a result, 42s Blue Phoenix yarn rose to 31.8 million yuan, a round increase of 1.3 million yuan from the previous day. 20s Double Horse yarn rose by 400,000 yuan, and other counts of coarse and fine yarns also recovered by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan to over 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened with weak sentiment, and the market was initially sluggish. Later, upon hearing that the prices of Fangjian Company were high, with second-grade printed poplin priced as high as 980,000 yuan, printed twill at 1.04 million yuan, Five Fortune B brand fine cloth at 735,000 yuan, and 12-pound Dragon Head fine diagonal at 810,000 yuan, which were not much different from market prices, sentiment improved, and merchants took advantage of the low prices to buy, and retail investors raised prices, with Dragon Head fine cloth rising to 880,000 yuan, an increase of 32,000 yuan from the previous day. Five Fortune Colorful Ball and other brands also improved by 15,000 to 31,000 or 2,000 yuan. Fabrics with active sales also showed strength.</p>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, China Fangjian Company sold cloth as usual, selling a total of 16,200 bolts, with a total of 39 purchase orders. 10 of them were from manufacturers, purchasing 1,120 bolts. 359 were cloth merchants, purchasing 15,080 bolts.</p>
<p>Valuation of Qingjin Factories Completed [Report from This Newspaper] A group of twelve people from the valuation review team of Qingdao and Tianjin of China Fangjian Company traveled to the two places this month to conduct on-site valuations. It is learned that the team has now completed its work and returned to Shanghai. It is said that detailed lists of each factory are currently being prepared and will be submitted to the Fangjian Company headquarters by the end of this month, so that they can be combined with the valuation lists of other factories belonging to the headquarters and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton is Stable and Weak. Yesterday, the spot cotton market improved because the cotton yarn market recovered after weakness, and yarn factories were slightly more interested in buying, so transactions improved, but credit had been unusually tight for the past week, and sellers were eager to sell, so prices lacked the strength to rise, and the trend remained soft. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,350 bales, with factory delivery prices trading at 4 million to 4.15 million yuan, and warehouse delivery prices trading at 4 million, 4.05 million to 4.19 million yuan.

<h3>Coal Prices Plunge by 30%</h3>
<p>[Report from This Newspaper] According to the Fuel Management Commission, since the middle of this month, approximately 20,000 tons of anthracite coal from Hankou have arrived in this city, and since the beginning of this month to date, the amount of Kaiping coal arriving at the port is estimated to be over 80,000 tons, and approximately 20,000 tons of Taiwan coal have also arrived. The supply of coal is very normal, so in recent days, general coal prices have fallen by 30% compared to the highest prices.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Portland Cement Trade Association, due to the gradual shortage of Portland cement in the market, sent a letter to the Cement Association, asking it to find ways to manufacture it. Yesterday, the association's standing committee decided to designate Shunjing Cement Factory to find ways to supply it. Currently, the factory can produce 200 to 300 tons of Portland cement per month. If demand increases sharply in the future, production can be increased continuously. 40,000 pounds are generated, and it will be shipped to the United States for sale on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Loan discounts have been slightly tightened, and the targets of the tightening are: 1. Manufacturers whose manufactured goods have not yet been sold; 2. Manufacturers with particularly high profits. The amount of loans that the association has currently recovered is approximately 30 billion yuan, which is approximately one-quarter of the value of goods shipped.</p>
<p>According to the results of this city's yarn market registration, yarn factories currently have over 40,000 pieces in stock, reworked yarn companies have over 20,000 pieces of yarn in stock, and yarn shops have over 3,000 pieces, totaling over 60,000 pieces in the city. In terms of production, state-owned and private yarn factories can produce over 2,000 pieces per day. Based on the current sales volume, it can be sustained for a long period.</p>

<h3>Memories of a Day Under Full Anesthesia</h3>
<p>— Wang Juerong</p>
<p>"Little brother, don't be afraid. Fall asleep quietly. When the anesthetic is administered in a moment, take slow, deep breaths. This way, you'll soon lose feeling and won't feel any pain!" A young doctor, speaking in pure Mandarin, said this gently to a patient lying on the operating table, waiting for surgery!</p>
<p>This patient was no more than sixteen or seventeen years old, dressed in a clean, white hospital gown, lying trembling on the operating table, like a lamb tied to an altar, awaiting the priests' slaughter.</p>
<p>Inside the operating room, no one dared to speak casually except for the chief physician. The poor patient felt a deathly silence. Apart from the sound of the doctors washing their hands, he could almost hear his own heart beating!</p>
<p>Gray curtains, soft light, gleaming surgical instruments, nurses wearing large white caps – all the solemnity, silence, and cleanliness became a source of terror for this young patient! At that moment, he felt boundless sorrow in his heart. He thought of his mother, he thought of home, and he regretted coming for the operation. But it was too late. A white mask was placed over his nose, and a peculiar chloroform smell drilled straight into his nasal passages – no, into his heart as well!</p>
<p>At this moment, he forgot his home, forgot his mother. He only wanted to temporarily stop breathing, so that this unfamiliar smell would no longer invade his nose. Truly, he forgot that this smell would alleviate his pain!</p>
<p>However, things were beyond his control. The more he didn't want to breathe, the more rapid his breathing became. At this time, he clearly heard the chief physician talking. He wanted to tell them that he wasn't asleep yet, to please wait before starting. But his mouth wouldn't obey his commands. He wanted to raise his hand to signal, but he couldn't move at all. Only now did he fully understand the true meaning of the common saying "my mouth says something my heart doesn't feel" and "the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." Before long, the sound of the conversation grew louder. It was as if the people talking had moved closer to his ear. Then, the sound became as loud as thunder, each word vibrating in his eardrum. Finally, the sound was so loud that he couldn't distinguish the meaning of each word. He only felt like he was on an airplane, flying through the clouds! The dizziness made him lose all feeling, and in that short amount of time, the skilled doctors had smoothly completed their task.</p>
<p>As the surgery was nearing completion, the assistants, alert, had already stopped the anesthetic. The poor little patient regained free air, and his pale face gradually turned rosy. "How necessary free air is for people!" one assistant thought with emotion.</p>
<p>The patient himself felt like he was returning to Earth from another world. The sounds returned to his ears, just as they did before he fell asleep. The sound of people talking went from blurred to faint, from faint to clear. When he was fully awake, the people talking seemed to be slowly moving away from his ear. Eventually, the volume of the sounds returned to normal, and he could gradually move his hands and feet. Of course, he also regained the freedom to speak. He forcefully opened his eyes, wanting to see the world after his brief departure. Indeed, these few minutes of unconsciousness felt like centuries to him! What he found most strange was that the scenery of the world, though still the same, had all turned a sky-blue color, as if he were wearing tinted glasses!</p>
<p>"Close your eyes quickly!" A gentle female voice began to vibrate in his ears: "Someone who has just been anesthetized should sleep quietly. Opening your eyes at this time will damage your eyesight!" These words interrupted the little patient's thoughts. He knew this was a normal phenomenon after anesthesia. But soon he felt uncomfortable because there was no pillow under his head. He asked for a soft pillow. At the same time, he had had nothing to eat for over a dozen hours, from the night before until now, making him feel ravenously hungry. He also asked for some food. All his requests were refused, on the grounds of preventing vomiting!</p>
<p>Heavens! He could endure not having a pillow, but not eating was truly unbearable! "Once I'm discharged, I'm definitely going to have a big meal!" He could only comfort himself with this kind of Ah Q-like thinking.</p>
<p>After all, someone who has been anesthetized is tired. He quickly fell into a deep sleep, sleeping for several hours. When he woke up, it was already dusk. A desolate yellow lamp was lit in the ward. The bedding on the empty beds on either side was piled high, as if someone was hiding inside. A moan came from afar, sending shivers down his spine!</p>
<p>The large trees outside the window rustled from time to time! The poor little patient, away from home for the first time, felt like he was isolated in the wilderness. He thought that someone might have died in the empty bed next to him. He also thought that someone might have died on the bed he was sleeping in just last night! At this time, it became even darker. Outside the window, he couldn't see anything clearly except for clusters of shadows of trees! A cool breeze blew in, and the moaning sound was exceptionally clear, as if it were right next to his left side. It was as if he saw a shadow swaying outside the window. He also seemed to see something squirming inside the white sheet on the empty bed across from him. He covered himself with the blanket. He repeatedly chanted "Czechoslovakia," but the more he chanted, the more awake he became. The more awake he became, the more frightened he felt. Finally, the area where he had been operated on began to ache in waves!</p>
<p>Insomnia is painful. Pain is even more unbearable. Add to that fear, sorrow, and agitation, and this one night, this single night, can truly be said to be the most painful page in the past personal history of this little brother!</p>
<p>Pain increases agitation, agitation causes insomnia, insomnia makes one anxious, and anxiety further increases pain. As a result, the child went from moaning to sobbing, and from sobbing to screaming wildly! He needed someone to keep him company, and he needed the comforting touch of a loving mother even more. He wanted to call for someone, forgetting that he could ring the bell. At this time, he only knew how to curse. He cursed the nurses, he cursed the doctors, and he cursed the ailment that was causing him pain!</p>
<p>His screams alarmed the night-shift head nurse, a kind old nanny. She comforted the little patient. She stroked him. She asked him caringly if the pain was really that severe. She gave him some medicine powder and a few spoonfuls of water. She told him that this was the most effective painkiller and sleeping aid. Then, she sat compassionately by the little patient's side, patting this large baby like a loving mother. Her kind attitude and caring touch gave the little patient enormous comfort! He no longer screamed wildly, no longer felt afraid. The sorrow in his heart was also mostly gone. He felt that there were still people in the world who cared about him! Soon, the pain in the wound gradually subsided, and his upper and lower eyelids gradually came closer together. Finally, he fell asleep peacefully.</p>
<p>The head nurse smiled knowingly, wrapped up the remaining medicine powder – medicine powder that didn't relieve pain at all – glanced at the patient with satisfaction, and walked in the direction of the moaning sound, to another sickroom, to begin her new work of comforting!</p>
<p>Heavens! Who says that sympathy and comfort aren't the most effective painkillers in the world!</p>
<p>Now, the little patient from thirteen years ago has become a doctor who has graduated seven years ago. Thinking of the pain he felt as a patient back then, he wrote this memoir to encourage himself and his colleagues. His conclusion is:</p>
<p>"When you are treating patients, please think about the pain you yourself feel when you are sick!"</p>
<h3>Syphilis and Blood Tests</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>In clinical practice, we often encounter patients like this: "Doctor! Can you test my blood?" "Ah! What do you want to test for? If you want to know if you have anemia, you should count red blood cells and hemoglobin; if you want to know if you have malaria or relapsing fever, you should check for malaria parasites and relapsing fever spirochetes; if you want to know if you have typhoid fever, you should do a Widal test; if you want to know the degree of diabetes, you should check blood sugar levels; your doctor needs to decide what you should be tested for based on your symptoms, and then report to the lab before they can start. Otherwise, it's completely clueless. Asking someone to test everything for you is like asking them to read the entire Twenty-Four Histories – where do you even begin!" I talked a lot, and only then did he tell me the purpose of the test: "Doctor! I want to know if there is poison in my blood?" Then I realized that what he wanted was to do a Wassermann test.</p>
<p>The Wassermann test is a standard method for checking for syphilis. Although there have been various modifications since the Wassermann test, it is still an authoritative method. But generally, people don't have a deep understanding of it. Let me write a few things to tell everyone!</p>
<p>If the test result shows syphilis, it is called a positive reaction, indicated by "++". Then look at the degree: there are strong positive (+++), positive (++), and weakly positive (+) distinctions. If there is no syphilis, it is called a negative reaction, indicated by "-".</p>
<p>A positive reaction generally indicates syphilis.</p>
<p>Not every patient with syphilis will show a positive reaction. In the first stage of syphilis, about 20% show a positive reaction; in the second stage of syphilis, during the rash stage, the highest rate is 95-100%; in the third stage of syphilis, the rate is 50-100%; in early latent syphilis, the rate is 28-83%. Therefore, a negative Wassermann test does not mean that someone "definitely does not have syphilis."</p>
<p>Diseases other than syphilis, such as leprosy, advanced pulmonary tuberculosis, scarlet fever, malaria, relapsing fever, cancer, and diabetes, can also sometimes cause a positive result.</p>
<p>Wassermann reactions mostly appear significantly five to six weeks after infection. In other words, before five or six weeks, the Wassermann reaction will always be negative, regardless of whether you have the disease. There is often a type of patient who, after engaging in unsafe sex, worries incessantly and rushes to the doctor to request a blood test. If the doctor doesn't understand the situation and goes ahead with the blood test, the result will be negative. The patient then thinks that he is innocent. In reality, you've been fooled and covered up the virus with a smokescreen, allowing it to incubate and grow. On the one hand, you think you are free of the disease and have sex with your wife, spreading the virus. Isn't this a great injustice?</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a negative reaction doesn't necessarily mean no syphilis; a positive reaction can also occur in other diseases. Moreover, lab reports sometimes have a mark like this: "+/-", which means doubtful. So, even the authoritative Wassermann reaction is unreliable. You should know that investigating diseases doesn't rely solely on one method. Doctors need to investigate in all aspects: for example, the history of past infections, the various changes that are now appearing on the body, and then make a determination. The Wassermann reaction is just a powerful piece of supporting evidence!</p>
<p>What is the reason why Lab A reports a positive result, while Lab B reports a negative result? The operation of the Wassermann reaction is not a simple matter. If the materials used or the equipment applied are inadequate, errors can occur. This is why the two reports may be different!</p>
<p>If someone has had syphilis, even after treatment, a single Wassermann test, even if it is negative, is not reliable. Repeated tests are needed, because after a certain amount of time, the test may still become positive.</p>
<p>People with latent syphilis may have a negative blood test, but an injection of 606 can be given to stimulate the reaction, and then the test may become positive again. This is called a provocative Wassermann reaction.</p>
<h3>Nutritional Disorders in Breastfed Infants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>Nutritional Disorders in Artificially Fed Infants – Nutritional Imbalance</p>
<p>1.  Breast milk is the best nutrition, and there is no need to worry too much about its intake.</p>
<p>2.  In infants with nutritional imbalance from mixed feeding, the ability to digest milk fat is significantly reduced. Tolerance to carbohydrates is not affected, so the principle is to reduce the fat content of cow's milk and add carbohydrates.</p>
<p>In mild cases, reduce the amount of cow's milk and dilute the milk with 2% grain juice or grain flour juice. Add nourishing sugar, nourishing maltose, malt juice, and Liebig's extract (2-5%). In severe cases, use skim milk or buttermilk, which have less fat, and add malt juice and Liebig's extract. Sometimes, commercially available malt syrup can be used instead of malt juice. The amount of malt juice paste or Liebig's extract added is increased or decreased depending on the nature of the stool. Increase the amount when hard stools are excreted, the so-called soap stools, and decrease the amount when the stools become soft.</p>
<p>Wasting Syndrome</p>
<p>This refers to the progression of nutritional imbalance. The amount of nutrition required for a child's growth should be determined by body weight. Each kilogram of body weight requires 115 to 130 calories.</p>
<p>Breast milk is best. If the breastfeeding power is weak and quickly exhausted, and the infant cannot suck enough milk, then express the breast milk and feed it with a spoon. Also, if development is insufficient due to a particular wet nurse (or breast milk), then replacing it with another wet nurse will easily improve growth.</p>
<p>When it is difficult to obtain enough breast milk, use mixed feeding, adding nourishing sugar, nourishing maltose, Liebig's extract, etc., to diluted cow's milk, i.e., rice milk, gruel milk, or % milk. If artificial feeding is desired, it is best to add a large amount of sugar to skim milk, buttermilk, or Liebig's extract, which have less fat. Infants with wasting syndrome secondary to external nutritional disorders, as described below, respond favorably to nutritional therapy; however, wasting syndrome based on internal abnormal constitution (exudative neurosis) is ineffective even with the latest nutritional therapy. Even breast milk is ineffective, and weakness may even occur. In such cases of primary wasting syndrome, protein therapy has been reported to be effective. Inject horse or human serum into the muscles every other day or every four or five days. The initial amount is 1.0 cubic centimeters, gradually increasing to 5.0. Dr. Kavis reported trying this on nineteen cases of primary wasting syndrome, with ten cases being completely cured. In cases with good results, the body weight curve showed a sharp increase two or three hundred serum injections later. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Study of "Kickback"</h3>
<p>— Hai Shao</p>
<p>The term "kickback" may seem perplexing at first glance. However, it is quite common in Shanghai, widely used among common people and well-known in teahouses and taverns. To give generously is to wear a virtuous expression; to receive meagerly is to harbor resentment. A brief summary reveals the ways of the world; whether loose or tight, it depicts joy, anger, and scolding. This word, judged by its literal meaning, is unremarkable. But looking at its sound for its meaning reveals its origins. Truly, it is "searching everywhere, wearing out iron shoes, only to find it with no effort at all."</p>
<p>This article takes a small topic and blows it up, seeming somewhat like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. But as the ancients said, "Jiang Ziya met Duke Wen of Zhou and cast his fishing line in Panxi Stream; Han Xin encountered Emperor Gaozu of Han and displayed his talent for restoring order." Latent spirits and soaring swans await their time to move; fortune and misfortune, poverty and success, all depend on fate. "Kickback" imitates the West, and its origins were obscure. As Western culture gradually spread eastward, it began to be commonly used. Although it is a minor matter, it is still related to the flourishing or decline of customs and the rise and fall of the world. Seeing the great in the small has been done since ancient times, and the convergence of wind and clouds is especially intense today. Those who seize the opportunity prosper; this is the meaning of it.</p>
<p>Since the victory, "cocktail parties" have become extremely popular. Those who are fond of delving into things have examined them repeatedly. The wool comes from the sheep's back, and foreigners can naturally explain it. "Kickback" has a long history, so how can we bear to let it be unknown? I happened to read a Western work about the origins of "kickback," so I have translated it to clarify the details. Citing scriptures and allusions is entirely the work of others, and I would not dare to steal their credit. I humbly present the facts as I know them and do my best to promote "virtuous governance." I hope it will amuse you, and readers certainly do not need to pay a TIP.</p>
<p>It is said that TIP is the condensed form of three English words, so a period should be added after each letter when reading it. The original is To Insure Promptness – meaning to ensure (service) quickly. The abbreviation becomes "kickback." In the past, the English custom was that in hotels or cafes, two small boxes would often be hung where guests came and went, to collect extra rewards from customers, and the words TIP were written on them. This is similar to the "incense money box" in our temples, using persuasion to encourage contributions. Although the words are different, the intention is the same.</p>
<p>The English word "TIP" was first used with the meaning of giving by Samuel Rowlands in 1610. Later, George Farquhar in 1706 and William Byrd in 1733 and other writers used "kickback" in plays or writings with the meaning of extra reward. Chronologically, this was during the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty. I wonder if people in Shanghai at that time also commonly used "kickback" in their speech?</p>
<p>The old Oxford Dictionary defines TIP as "a small sum of money given to servants, errand boys, etc." To seek more detail, it further says: "An additional sum of money, of an uncertain amount, given to servants, coachmen, or other people’s errand boys, for service or in hope of service."</p>
<p>In summary, we can now have a correct understanding of the word "kickback." For those who want prompt service, "kickback" is the golden brick to knock on the door; this is the first definition. When hoping to obtain certain services, "kickback" is indispensable, throwing a brick to attract jade; this is the second definition. The amount of the "kickback" cannot be fixed, the wall is high and the brick is thick; this is the third definition. Draw inferences from one instance, and you will understand more than half of the way to use "kickback"!</p>
<p>Shanghai is the most prosperous place in the world, always pioneering trends. We might as well expand its definition and say directly: "Kickback" is a small account that guests casually reward to waiters. If used properly, everyone is happy; if used improperly, both sides are harmed. In social situations, in front of girlfriends, it is better to be generous than stingy, and it is better to be generous than frugal. Losing big for small is an ancient warning; a small impatience ruins great plans, and it is even more appropriate to reflect on these words repeatedly and not ignore them because the word is "simple."</p>
<p>When diners give an extra "kickback" on top of the standard three or three more, the courteous waiters in Beijing, Tianjin, and Henan restaurants must straighten their throats and shout loudly, "Additional reward of [number] yuan, thank you...!" The "thank you" is long and strong, with a vigor that is comparable to Yang Yanhui's "calling the Tartar" in the opera "Si Lang Visits His Mother"! The waiter stands at attention, all the way out the door, smiling and bowing, which adds luster to both the host and the guest. This is the positive side of the "kickback" effect. When the guest comes back for the second time, the waiter's impression is deep, and the service will be even more attentive, making the guest feel at home and everyone happy. Every request is answered, and everything is as desired. This is the side-effect of "kickback." If you want the result, you must plant the cause beforehand. Those who are aware of the times should remember this.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong and Guangdong restaurants, in addition to the standard tip, diners often pay a "kickback" to the tea servers in order to curry favor, especially for female patrons. However, the rigid style of "accepting without refusing, receiving without thanking" often amazes outsiders. In fact, Cantonese people call small accounts "hand tremors." How to make the hand tremble depends on the diner's discretion. I don't believe that the recipient can truly "tremble" his hand without feeling joy in his heart!</p>
<h3>Two Lyrics to "Drunken Peach Spring"</h3>
<p>— Hu Lu</p>
<p>According to a report from Chengdu, this newspaper, a "Shangri-La" was discovered in the old Guangshan Mountain in Peng County, western Sichuan. Most of the residents fled into the mountains during the war, living together as a clan, self-sufficient, and completely unaware of the current situation and prices. I hereby fill in this verse!</p>
<p>Warfare fills the land with weeping refugees,</p>
<p>Not knowing where to flee?</p>
<p>Who cares that life is cheaper than a pig or sheep,</p>
<p>Corpses lie everywhere!</p>
<p>Shangri-La is suddenly reported in the mountains,</p>
<p>Old Guangshan famous on the mountains.</p>
<p>Means of transportation strain the mind,</p>
<p>A fool's dream that can never be repaid?</p>
<p>Three bags are emptied, with pain and despair,</p>
<p>Longing in vain!</p>
<p>Wealthy tycoons' houses are filled with gold,</p>
<p>Joyfully greedy for the city's madness!</p>
<p>Peach Spring may be good, relying on hard work,</p>
<p>Everyone forgets it with a laugh!</p>
<p>The Southeast has land better than paradise,</p>
<p>Singing and dancing every day!</p>
<h3>How Many Languages Are There in the World?</h3>
<p>— Lun</p>
<p>The number of human languages is truly astounding. According to linguists, there are roughly two or three thousand languages.</p>
<p>Modern human languages can generally be divided into world languages, national languages, and ethnic languages. World languages have the widest use, followed by national languages, and then ethnic languages.</p>
<p>Representing world languages are English, Chinese, French, Russian, Arabic, Spanish, German, Dutch, and Portuguese. English is used as a national language by the English, Americans, Irish, Canadians, Australians, New Zealanders, and South Africans. In addition, English is also spoken in Africa, India, Oceania, Egypt, China, and the Near East. Approximately 540 million people use English, of whom 170 million use it as their national language. More than 500 million people use Chinese. Although there are many dialects in China, Chinese characters have been introduced to Japan, Korea, and parts of Indochina due to China's past cultural superiority over neighboring countries, thus becoming an international language in the Far East. 107 million people use French. They are distributed in Western Europe, North Africa, Canada, Britain, and Indochina, of which 45 million use French as their national language. 250 million people use Russian, including 90 million who commonly use it as their national language. The range of use is the Slavic peoples, Finland, Romania, part of China, and Iran. 37 million people speak Arabic as their national language. They are distributed in countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Iraq. In addition, Arabic is also the academic and religious language of Muslim countries, which have a total population of 200 million people, distributed in a vast region from North Africa in the west to northern India and western China, and from the Balkans to the Malay Archipelago. 80 million people speak Spanish, of which 65 million use it as their national language. There used to be 80 million people who spoke German, but due to the terrible crimes of the fascist empire, German is no longer as popular as it used to be. 60 million people use Dutch, of which 12.5 million in Europe, the Boers of South Africa, and the Dutch East Indies use it as their national language. 45 million people speak Portuguese, of which 36 million use it as their national language.</p>
<h3>The Most Beloved Place</h3>
<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>One summer afternoon, when the great scientist Edison returned home from his laboratory, which had benefited all of humanity, his wife greeted him and said affectionately, "You work too hard, dear. You've been working tirelessly for too long, which is very detrimental to your health. I advise you to find a good place to rest."</p>
<p>"But where should I go?" the great inventor said.</p>
<p>"Wherever you like, choose the place you love most."</p>
<p>"Alright," Edison said with a smile, "I'll leave tomorrow."</p>
<p>The next day, Edison got up early in the morning and went to his laboratory.</p>
<h3>Three-Rank Officials and the County Magistrate</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>The three-rank duties in the Song Dynasty were the lowest-ranking officials in the capital, with a monthly salary of seven hundred coins and half a catty of meat vouchers, which was simply abjectly poor. Someone wrote a poem to mock himself, titled at the post station: "Serving in the three ranks is truly sad, low and lonely, only oneself knows; when will seven hundred coins make one rich? When will half a catty of mutton make one fat?" Unexpectedly, the situation at the bottom actually reached the top, so the court said, "If it's like this, how can we expect integrity?" and actually adjusted the treatment. Furthermore, Academician Shi Manqing also initially worked in this position. The reason was that Shi's initial examination luck was poor. He was reported for cheating in the imperial examination and re-examined, because Shi was one of the few who gained and then lost the position. He was reassigned to the three-rank borrowed post. When Fu Zhao took back the granted imperial boots and clothing, how could these failed candidates not have the sorrow of seeing the fat meat in their mouths being snatched away, so they cried bitterly. Only Shi remained unconcerned, writing a poem: "If one is untalented, just be a three-rank official, seeking a salary is like being a recording secretary? From now on, stop calling me 'Qing Jin', and just ride my horse east, west, south, and north." This Academician Shi, who was praised by Ouyang Xiu after his death as being heroic in life and a spirit after death, was ultimately likeable.</p>
<p>Although a county magistrate is a small official of the seventh rank, in the Ming and Qing dynasties, one still had to be a graduate of the second rank of the orthodox path to obtain the position. Moreover, directly governing the people is precisely the county magistrate's job, scraping the land and skimming profits are much more convenient than for officials in the capital. It's just that counties differ in wealth and the integrity of individuals varies, so while there are many who taste sweetness, throughout history, there must be many who suffer hardships. As a certain short essay says: "Yu Dong, in his youth, became the magistrate of Huarong County, usually jesting and joking, writing a poem: 'The magistrate of Huarong is a mere trifle, most graduates of the third rank are uneducated. The county secretary and registrar are all colleagues, the assistant prefect and deputy prefect are all superiors. In haste, one has no time to swallow cold rice, in leisure, one has a mouth to chew dried fish. A past life's karma, this life's suffering, the magistrate of Huarong is a mere trifle.'" Although this is self-mockery, it is nonetheless full of complaints on the page. Cold rice and dried fish, although bland, are still better than grass roots and tree bark, after all. "Endure the utmost suffering, to become a superior man," it is clear that someone named Yu is not good at being an official.</p>

<h3>Miss America</h3>
<p>— Xu Shuyuan</p>
<p>Miss America's Troop Support Movement</p>
<p>In America, soldiers are absolutely the darlings of heaven, which is not because American soldiers are arrogant, but because America indeed reveres soldiers, and American soldiers do indeed have aspects worthy of reverence. First, American soldiers have a very high level of education. Privates have at least graduated from middle school, and those who have graduated from university, worn square caps, black robes, and have academic master's or doctoral titles make up at least three or four out of ten. Second, America uses a conscription system. Privates are all from good families, there are no mercenaries, nor are there substitutes for military service. American soldiers can be called "brave." When they put on their uniforms, they certainly look heroic, but they will never use that tiger skin to scare the common people, because the common soldier in America is also a commoner, not a special class. Moreover, American soldiers are not allowed to bring weapons out of the barracks. Except for duty personnel who have public handguns, all other officers and soldiers are not allowed to carry them. Abusing weapons is the easiest way to corrupt military discipline, and it is difficult to distinguish between good and bad, true and false. With the above two reasons, the status of American soldiers in society is naturally lofty. A high status naturally leads to the admiration of women.</p>
<p>The American women's community has colorful troop support organizations. The most large-scale ones are USO (United Service Organization), the Red Cross, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Women's Club, and also mothers' clubs and sisterhoods that also do troop support work. USO is the one that does the most vigorous troop support work. The staff includes women leaders, parents, students, movie stars, actors, and singing stars. It has many traveling theater troupes that perform USO Shows for free in various military camps and battlefields. Branches are set up in all large and small cities across the United States, managing military dormitories, cafeterias, dance parties, libraries, and medical clinics. There is also a loan department. If a soldier is short of money, he can borrow dozens of dollars from the association. It is called a loan, but in reality, it does not need to be repaid.</p>
<p>I remember when I was recovering in the military hospital at the Santa Ana Air Force Base in California, it was Christmas. Women working for the USO and the Red Cross came to the hospital ward to offer their condolences, asking the patients what gifts they wanted. They could all provide them. Many black soldiers specifically asked for cash, so the working women raised funds from the women's community in the city. After a while, they brought a large sum of American dollars and silver coins, about several thousand dollars, and distributed them to a dozen black soldiers. They often had singing groups come to the hospital wards to perform, and you could request songs. There was also a working woman stationed in the hospital who specialized in teaching popular songs for free, such as "Pistol Packing Mama." All of these women's troop support groups are completely charitable in nature. The staff work for free and even donate large sums of money. Only American women truly do this kind of losing business. They can indeed boost morale and stir up the fighting spirit. If Miss America did not mobilize, MacArthur and Eisenhower would be discouraged.</p>
<h3>National Merchant Shipping Bureau's Reply to Mr. Qian Chaozhen</h3>
<p>[Letter] Read Mr. Qian Chaozhen's letter "Please Provide Services for Elderly and Weak Passengers at the Merchant Shipping Bureau" published in the Social Services section of your newspaper on October 18th, noted with gratitude. We are enclosing the Bureau's reply for your reference and publication. We would be immensely grateful. Respectfully addressed to the Editorial Department of the Shen Bao Newspaper, Social Services Section, National Merchant Shipping Bureau.</p>
<p>Regarding the "no sending-off guests onto the ship" clause, it is a measure that this Bureau is forced to take in order to maintain order on the ship and consider the safety of passengers. Otherwise, anyone can board the ship. Not only will the order on the ship be disrupted, but pickpockets will also infiltrate. Moreover, passengers who have purchased tickets will board the ship and refuse to disembark, exceeding the ship's passenger limit and hindering navigational safety, so we must strictly restrict it. As for "providing services for elderly and weak passengers," this Bureau has previously instructed the pier police and service staff on each ship that they should assist and care for elderly, weak, and young passengers boarding and disembarking. However, there are many passengers, and there may be oversights, for which we deeply apologize. In addition to reiterating the order to pay attention at all times, we hereby issue a public reply, hoping for your understanding!</p>

<h3>Forcibly Selling Rent Receipts - Investigated as Fraudulent Extortion</h3>
<p>We recently received a letter stating that, according to a letter from reader Zhu Yimin, someone is forcibly selling "rent receipts." We were instructed to investigate and handle the matter. After investigation by our personnel, it was discovered that the Dazhong Publishing House has not issued any rent receipts, and it is purely unscrupulous elements using the name to commit fraudulent extortion. In addition to instructing each branch bureau (office) to pay close attention to prevention and investigation at all times, we hereby send a reply, hoping you will take note of it!
